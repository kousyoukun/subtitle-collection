1
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,342
This is what I get in return for 30 years
of service for my company?

2
00:03:07,428 --> 00:03:10,356
And they send some yo-yo like you
in here,

3
00:03:10,442 --> 00:03:12,861
to try to tell me that I'm out of a job?

4
00:03:12,947 --> 00:03:15,197
They should be telling you
you're out of a job.

5
00:03:15,283 --> 00:03:19,207
You have a lot of gall, coming in here
and firing your No.1 producer.

6
00:03:19,293 --> 00:03:22,585
You're going to go home and make
more money than you've ever made in your life

7
00:03:22,671 --> 00:03:24,939
and I'm going to go home
without a pay cheque. Fuck you.

8
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:29,031
I guess you leave me dumbfounded.
I don't know where this is coming from.

9
00:03:29,117 --> 00:03:33,423
How am I meant to go back as a man
and explain to my wife I lost my job?

10
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:39,837
On a stress level, I've heard that
losing your job is like a death in the family.

11
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,317
But personally,
I feel more like

12
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:48,749
the people I worked with
were my family and I died.

13
00:03:48,835 --> 00:03:51,309
I can't afford to be unemployed.

14
00:03:51,395 --> 00:03:54,177
I have a house payment,
I have children.

15
00:03:54,263 --> 00:03:56,569
I don't know how you can live
with yourself,

16
00:03:56,655 --> 00:04:00,113
but I'm sure that you'll find a way
while the rest of us are suffering.

17
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,717
Who the fuck are you, man?

18
00:04:03,448 --> 00:04:06,518
Excellent question. Who the fuck am I?

19
00:04:06,604 --> 00:04:08,855
Poor Steve has worked here
for seven years.

20
00:04:08,941 --> 00:04:13,150
He's never had a meeting with me
before or passed me in the hall,

21
00:04:13,236 --> 00:04:15,373
or told me a story in the break room.

22
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:16,955
That's because I don't work here.

23
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:20,349
I work for another company that lends
me out to pussies like Steve's boss

24
00:04:20,435 --> 00:04:22,901
who don't have the balls
to sack their own employees,

25
00:04:22,987 --> 00:04:28,207
in some cases for good reason.
People do crazy shit when they get fired.

26
00:04:32,514 --> 00:04:34,458
Did I do something wrong?

27
00:04:34,544 --> 00:04:36,875
I mean, is there something
I could do differently here?

28
00:04:36,961 --> 00:04:42,263
This is not an assessment of your
productivity. Don't take this personally.

29
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:44,293
Don't take it personally.

30
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:47,154
Steven, I want you to review this packet.

31
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,057
Take it seriously. I think you're gonna
find a lot of good answers in here.

32
00:04:51,143 --> 00:04:53,481
I'm sure this is gonna be very helpful -
a packet.

33
00:04:53,567 --> 00:04:57,147
Thank you... A packet.

34
00:04:59,584 --> 00:05:05,196
Well, anybody who ever built an empire
or changed the world sat where you are right now.

35
00:05:05,282 --> 00:05:08,562
And it's because they sat there
they were able to do it.

36
00:05:08,648 --> 00:05:10,803
That's the truth.

37
00:05:16,506 --> 00:05:18,975
I'm gonna need your keycard.

38
00:05:20,874 --> 00:05:22,309
Great. OK.

39
00:05:22,395 --> 00:05:27,556
Now, I want you to take the day, go get
together your personal things, then tomorrow

40
00:05:27,642 --> 00:05:30,791
you get yourself some exercise.
You go out for a jog,

41
00:05:30,877 --> 00:05:35,171
you give yourself some routines
and pretty soon you find your legs.

42
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:39,241
How do I get in touch with you?
- Don't worry, we'll be in touch soon.

43
00:05:39,327 --> 00:05:41,923
This is just the beginning.

44
00:05:42,484 --> 00:05:45,125
I'll never see Steve again.

45
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,283
To know me is to fly with me.
This is where I live.

46
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,351
When I run my card,

47
00:06:12,437 --> 00:06:17,273
the system automatically prompts the desk clerk
to greet me with this exact statement:

48
00:06:17,456 --> 00:06:19,149
Pleasure to see you again,
Mr Bingham.

49
00:06:19,235 --> 00:06:23,679
It's these kinds of systemised friendly
touches that keep my world in orbit.

50
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:01,149
All the things you probably hate
about travelling -

51
00:07:01,235 --> 00:07:05,225
the recycled air, the artificial lighting,
the digital juice dispensers,

52
00:07:05,311 --> 00:07:10,043
the cheap sushi -
are warm reminders that I'm home.

53
00:07:22,492 --> 00:07:24,825
Do you want the cancer?

54
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,455
The what?
- Do you want the cancer?

55
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,455
The cancer?

56
00:07:31,602 --> 00:07:37,483
The can...sir?
- Oh, no. I'm fine, thank you.

57
00:07:58,837 --> 00:08:01,817
How much does your life weigh?

58
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,555
Imagine for a second
that you're carrying a backpack.

59
00:08:05,641 --> 00:08:11,069
I want you to feel the straps
on your shoulders. Feel 'em?

60
00:08:11,392 --> 00:08:14,841
Now I want you to pack it with
all the stuff that you have in your life.

61
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,689
Start with the little things,

62
00:08:16,775 --> 00:08:21,120
the things on shelves and in drawers
the knick-knacks, the collectibles.

63
00:08:21,206 --> 00:08:23,538
Feel the weight as that adds up.

64
00:08:23,624 --> 00:08:29,931
Then you start adding larger stuff -
clothes, table-top appliances, lamps, linens...

65
00:08:30,017 --> 00:08:32,125
your TV...

66
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:35,841
The backpack should be getting
pretty heavy now. And you go bigger.

67
00:08:36,286 --> 00:08:40,105
Your couch, bed, your kitchen table.
Stuff it all in there.

68
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,238
Your car, get it in there.

69
00:08:42,324 --> 00:08:46,735
Your home, whether it's
a studio apartment or a two-bedroomed house.

70
00:08:46,821 --> 00:08:50,939
I want you to stuff it all
into that backpack.

71
00:08:52,158 --> 00:08:54,531
Now try to walk.

72
00:08:55,926 --> 00:08:58,331
It's kind of hard, isn't it?

73
00:08:58,534 --> 00:09:00,491
This is what we do to ourselves
on a daily basis

74
00:09:00,577 --> 00:09:05,390
We weigh ourselves down until we can't
even move. And make no mistake...

75
00:09:05,476 --> 00:09:07,354
moving is living.

76
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,737
Now, I'm gonna set that backpack on fire.
What do you want to take out of it?

77
00:09:11,823 --> 00:09:13,508
Photos?

78
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:18,271
Photos are for people who can't remember.
Drink some ginkgo and let the photos burn.

79
00:09:18,574 --> 00:09:25,028
In fact, let everything burn
and imagine waking up tomorrow with nothing.

80
00:09:26,118 --> 00:09:29,057
It's kind of exhilarating, isn't it?

81
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:38,393
Welcome back, Mr Bingham.

82
00:09:47,288 --> 00:09:51,033
Ryan Bingham's office.
- You have me in a Dodge Stratus in Kansas City.

83
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:53,680
They were out of all full-size sedans.
- Did you try...

84
00:09:53,766 --> 00:09:58,223
Yes, I reminded them of your remarkable
No.1 Gold Club status in years in the program.

85
00:09:58,309 --> 00:10:01,374
They are literally moving mountains
to see you in a Sebring.

86
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,773
Fair enough. Any other messages?
- Er...your sister Kara called.

87
00:10:04,859 --> 00:10:07,295
Needs to speak urgently
about your sister's wedding.

88
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:10,433
I told her you were mid-air,
and not even I knew your destination.

89
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:15,393
Well done. - You got an invitation
to speak at GoalQuest in Vegas.

90
00:10:16,398 --> 00:10:17,479
GoalQuest 20?

91
00:10:17,565 --> 00:10:22,369
Every once in a while, I do speaking engagements,
motivational stuff. But GoalQuest?

92
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,871
We're talking major Tony Robbins shit.

93
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:29,550
It's got a hologram on it.
They're calling it Dos Equis.

94
00:10:29,636 --> 00:10:32,013
All right, I'll check in.
- I've got Craig Gregory for you.

95
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:35,608
Wait...ah.
Fuck.

96
00:10:35,694 --> 00:10:37,660
How is my little road warrior?

97
00:10:37,746 --> 00:10:40,541
Hey, 20 minutes from boarding
into a world of bliss.

98
00:10:40,627 --> 00:10:42,931
Real good numbers out of Phoenix,
Ry guy.

99
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:46,647
You know that Big Auto is about to cut
another 10K by the end of the month?

100
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:48,823
No kidding.
- Christmas came early.

101
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:52,377
I wish you could be in five places, but
I need you here in Omaha this week. Alright?

102
00:10:52,463 --> 00:10:56,927
I thought you needed me everywhere.
- We got something real big, a real game changer.

103
00:10:57,013 --> 00:10:58,431
What are we talking about here?

104
00:10:58,517 --> 00:11:04,431
You'll see. Today I took my first crap
in two weeks - hallelujah.

105
00:11:04,517 --> 00:11:08,719
That's me hanging up on you.
- Great, love that sound.

106
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:30,067
Are you satisfied with Maestro?

107
00:11:32,546 --> 00:11:34,637
Yeah, I am.

108
00:11:34,952 --> 00:11:36,987
A little stingy with their miles.
I like Hertz.

109
00:11:37,073 --> 00:11:43,200
No, Hertz keeps its vehicles too long.
If a car has over 20,000 miles, I won't drive it.

110
00:11:43,298 --> 00:11:46,196
Maestro doesn't instant checkout.
I like the park-and-go.

111
00:11:46,282 --> 00:11:50,850
Hertz doesn't guarantee navigation.
- You don't seem like a girl who needs directions.

112
00:11:50,936 --> 00:11:55,562
I hate asking for directions.
- That's why I get a nav.

113
00:11:57,194 --> 00:12:00,786
That new outfit, Colonial, isn't bad.

114
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,795
Is that a joke?
- Yes.

115
00:12:03,881 --> 00:12:07,281
Their kiosk placement blows.
- They never have available upgrades.

116
00:12:07,367 --> 00:12:11,304
Basically, it's a fleet of shit boxes. I
don't know how they're still in business.

117
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:14,667
I'm Ryan.
- I'm Alex.

118
00:12:17,774 --> 00:12:22,458
Aww...Maplewood card.
How dare you bring that into this palace?

119
00:12:22,544 --> 00:12:26,457
Hilton offers equal value and better food but
the Maplewood gives out warm cookies at check-in.

120
00:12:26,543 --> 00:12:30,007
I'm a sucker for simulated hospitality.

121
00:12:30,093 --> 00:12:36,370
There's an industry term for that.
It's a mixture of faux and homey - faumey.

122
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:40,335
Oh, my God.
I wasn't sure this actually existed.

123
00:12:40,421 --> 00:12:45,520
This is the American Airlines...
- It's a Concierge Key, yeah.

124
00:12:48,672 --> 00:12:52,231
What is that, carbon fibre?
- Graphite.

125
00:12:52,328 --> 00:12:55,699
Oh, I love the weight. - I was pretty excited
the day that bad boy came in.

126
00:12:55,785 --> 00:13:02,138
I'll say. I put up pretty pedestrian numbers.
60 thou a year, domestic.

127
00:13:02,453 --> 00:13:04,735
That's not bad.
- Don't patronise me.

128
00:13:04,821 --> 00:13:07,151
What's your total?
- It's a personal question.

129
00:13:07,237 --> 00:13:08,750
Pleace.
- And we hardly know each other.

130
00:13:08,836 --> 00:13:13,066
Show some hubris.
Come on, impress me.

131
00:13:13,414 --> 00:13:15,960
I bet it's huge.
- You have no idea.

132
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:18,378
How big?

133
00:13:18,693 --> 00:13:22,724
What is it, this big? This big?
- I don't want to brag.

134
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,778
Oh, come on! Come on.

135
00:13:24,864 --> 00:13:28,748
Let's just say I have a number in mind.
I haven't hit it yet.

136
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:36,441
This is pretty fucking sexy.
- Hope it doesn't cheapen our relationship.

137
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:41,003
We're two people who get turned on by Elite Status.
I think cheap is our starting point.

138
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:44,724
There's nothing cheap about loyalty.

139
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:52,059
We came up with this master plan,
which was for me...

140
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:56,622
...to put gauze,
to put bandages on both my hands.

141
00:13:56,708 --> 00:14:02,364
Then we got on the plane,
transatlantic, flying to erm...Zurich.

142
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:07,102
I waited till it was dark,
and I walked up to the bathroom with her.

143
00:14:07,188 --> 00:14:09,911
Everybody was watching the movie and I was like...

144
00:14:10,075 --> 00:14:15,438
Opened up, went inside. She opened the door for me,
and came in like she was gonna help me.

145
00:14:15,524 --> 00:14:19,547
We gave it our best shot. It wasn't
great. But it was fun. It was tricky.

146
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:22,672
Give me some details.
- It's not so easy. Have you tried it?

147
00:14:22,758 --> 00:14:25,754
It's not so easy.
- Yes, I have.

148
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:29,545
Really?
- Really.

149
00:14:34,035 --> 00:14:36,486
You've done that?
- I have done that.

150
00:14:36,572 --> 00:14:41,186
On a transatlantic flight?
- On a domestic flight - regional, actually.

151
00:14:41,272 --> 00:14:44,341
At night-time?
- Daytime.

152
00:14:44,427 --> 00:14:46,485
What?
- How do you do that?

153
00:14:46,571 --> 00:14:49,910
Oh, I'm really flexible.

154
00:14:52,981 --> 00:14:56,518
Look. Ohh.

155
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:03,350
Ah, I should throw these out.

156
00:15:06,513 --> 00:15:08,711
We can always use that room
with the ice machine.

157
00:15:08,797 --> 00:15:10,974
Look.

158
00:15:26,515 --> 00:15:28,770
Good call on that towel rack.

159
00:15:28,856 --> 00:15:31,203
I like how you burritoed me
in the sofa cushions.

160
00:15:31,289 --> 00:15:33,032
I was improvising.

161
00:15:33,118 --> 00:15:36,655
Shame we didn't make it to the closet.

162
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:40,335
We got to do this again.
- Oh, yeah.

163
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:49,147
I'm in Newark on the 12th,
Modesto on the 13th...

164
00:15:49,233 --> 00:15:51,394
Oklahoma City on the 15th...

165
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,985
Any Southwest? I'll be swinging by
Albuquerque week of the 16th.

166
00:15:55,071 --> 00:15:58,107
No, I'm in Florida on the 20th.
- Fort Lauderdale?

167
00:15:58,193 --> 00:16:01,990
Miami.
- That's nothing. - 40 minutes.

168
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:14,811
I should probably go back to my room
so I can wake up in my bed.

169
00:16:14,897 --> 00:16:18,014
I think that would be
the ladylike thing to do.

170
00:16:25,435 --> 00:16:29,798
Nice meeting you.
- A pleasure.

171
00:17:03,405 --> 00:17:04,645
Hello?

172
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:06,313
Hey, Ryan, how you holding up?

173
00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:09,956
Every family has one person
who keeps the genealogy in check.

174
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:12,739
That's my sister Kara - the glue.

175
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:15,420
Fine. You and the kids?

176
00:17:15,506 --> 00:17:19,214
Missy's outstanding,
Matthew made varsity. How's the road?

177
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,312
Couldn't be better.

178
00:17:20,398 --> 00:17:22,391
Good. So, Ryan?

179
00:17:22,477 --> 00:17:23,808
Yeah?

180
00:17:23,894 --> 00:17:28,918
I didn't even want to ask you this, because I know
how you are about doing things for others.

181
00:17:29,004 --> 00:17:33,308
But we're coming up on three weeks to go to
Julie's wedding and we could really use your help.

182
00:17:33,394 --> 00:17:34,518
Yeah?

183
00:17:34,604 --> 00:17:36,326
We've been sending people these kits,

184
00:17:36,412 --> 00:17:39,074
so they can print out photos
of Julie and Jim on cardbord,

185
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,400
and then take photos of them in interesting places,
like that gnome in the French movie.

186
00:17:43,486 --> 00:17:45,189
Why?

187
00:17:45,275 --> 00:17:48,906
Because it's Julie's wedding and she thinks
it would be fun. Does it matter why?

188
00:17:48,992 --> 00:17:50,106
How is Julie?

189
00:17:50,192 --> 00:17:52,198
Would you call her.
She thinks you've turned to butter.

190
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:56,236
You're awfully isolated how you live.
- Isolated? I'm surrounded.

191
00:17:56,322 --> 00:17:58,664
So your assistant said
you were gonna be in Vegas.

192
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,810
Did he?

193
00:17:59,896 --> 00:18:03,739
Can you get a photo of the cut-out
in front of the Luxor pyramid?

194
00:18:03,825 --> 00:18:06,501
The place is a shithole.
Nobody stays there.

195
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:11,760
Jesus, Ryan, I'm not asking you to check in.
Can you just take a stupid photo?

196
00:18:11,933 --> 00:18:13,464
I'll try my best.

197
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,169
Thank you for trying your best.

198
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:38,416
Last year,
I spent 322 days on the road,

199
00:18:38,502 --> 00:18:43,127
which means I had to spend
43 miserable days at home.

200
00:19:06,469 --> 00:19:08,473
Hey, neighbour.

201
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:15,554
I signed for this while you were gone.
- Oh, thanks.

202
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:19,494
I hope it wasn't too much of a bother.
- Nah.

203
00:19:24,637 --> 00:19:28,545
It's my sister. I haven't met the guy yet.
They're getting married.

204
00:19:28,631 --> 00:19:30,750
Lots of luck.
- I know, right?

205
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:35,385
What are you doing tonight?
You wanna come over later?

206
00:19:37,373 --> 00:19:39,677
Um...I've started seeing somebody.

207
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:43,034
Oh. OK. Great.

208
00:19:43,439 --> 00:19:45,968
Hey, it's good to see you.

209
00:19:46,054 --> 00:19:49,804
You too.
- It seems like it's been a while this time.

210
00:20:07,477 --> 00:20:11,362
I'm thrilled that everyone's back
under one roof. Welcome home, boy's.

211
00:20:11,448 --> 00:20:14,412
There's been a lot of whispering about
why we're here, so let me jump right in.

212
00:20:14,498 --> 00:20:18,008
Retailers are down 20%.

213
00:20:18,094 --> 00:20:22,664
Auto industry is in the dump.
Housing market doesn't have a heartbeat.

214
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:27,101
It is one of the worst times on record
for America.

215
00:20:27,328 --> 00:20:30,654
This is our moment.

216
00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:35,962
Now, last summer, we received
a dynamite young woman here from Cornell.

217
00:20:36,048 --> 00:20:39,874
And she had some pretty big ideas
that she challenged me with.

218
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,284
My first reaction was,
"Who does this kid think she is?"

219
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:45,116
But after I gave it a listen,
she really knocked me out. So...

220
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:50,007
With a peek into our future,
Natalie Keener.

221
00:20:51,706 --> 00:20:56,364
If there's one word I want to
leave you with today, it's this.

222
00:20:57,753 --> 00:21:00,112
Glocal?

223
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:02,157
Glocal.

224
00:21:02,243 --> 00:21:06,481
Our global must become local.

225
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:12,119
This company keeps 23 people
on the road at least 250 days a year.

226
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:15,175
It's expensive and it's inefficient

227
00:21:15,261 --> 00:21:17,722
When I came to Craig
three months ago with this,

228
00:21:17,808 --> 00:21:22,710
he told me, and quite astutely, it's only
a problem if you have a solution.

229
00:21:22,796 --> 00:21:26,426
Well, today I stand before you
with just that.

230
00:21:27,422 --> 00:21:31,859
You all know Ned in reception.
Today I'm gonna fire Ned.

231
00:21:32,031 --> 00:21:35,530
Sorry, Ned. I'm sure HR
will hire you back this afternoon.

232
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,929
We'll see about that.

233
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,640
Ned could be any employee in any one
of our clients' locations worldwide.

234
00:21:42,726 --> 00:21:44,720
Strategy packets
will be shipped in advance.

235
00:21:44,806 --> 00:21:49,218
Ned will be given a seat and find one
of our transition specialists waiting.

236
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:51,021
Mr Laskin,

237
00:21:51,107 --> 00:21:54,862
we're having this conversation
as your position is no longer available.

238
00:21:54,948 --> 00:21:57,107
I don't understand. I'm fired?

239
00:21:57,193 --> 00:21:59,404
Hearing the words
"You've been let go" is never easy.

240
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:02,142
Change is scary,
but consider the following:

241
00:22:02,228 --> 00:22:05,850
anybody who ever built an empire or
changed the world sat where you are now.

242
00:22:05,936 --> 00:22:09,342
And it's because they sat there
that they were able to do it.

243
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:10,619
That's my fucking line.

244
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:12,635
But what happens now?

245
00:22:12,721 --> 00:22:16,390
This is the first step of a process that
ends with you in a job that fulfils you.

246
00:22:16,476 --> 00:22:17,941
Yeah, but how does it work?

247
00:22:18,027 --> 00:22:20,026
Take the packet in front of you.

248
00:22:20,112 --> 00:22:23,306
Review it - all the answers
you're looking for are inside.

249
00:22:23,392 --> 00:22:27,713
Fill out the necessary information and
you're on the way to new opportunities.

250
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:31,897
Ned, go back to your desk
and start putting together your things.

251
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:35,904
As a favour to me, I'd appreciate it
if you didn't spread the news just yet.

252
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,776
Panic doesn't help anyone.

253
00:22:37,862 --> 00:22:40,416
I understand.

254
00:22:40,502 --> 00:22:42,995
Give it up for Ned.

255
00:22:46,801 --> 00:22:50,507
You can start the morning in Boston,
stop in Dallas over lunch,

256
00:22:50,593 --> 00:22:54,724
and finish the day in San Francisco.
All for the price of a T1 line.

257
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:58,094
Our inflated travel budget
is eviscerated by 85%.

258
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,885
And more importantly,
to you guys on the road,

259
00:23:01,971 --> 00:23:06,521
no more Christmases in a hotel in Tulsa,
no more hours lost to weather delays.

260
00:23:06,607 --> 00:23:09,791
You get to come home.

261
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:14,169
Tell me you're not taking this seriously.

262
00:23:14,255 --> 00:23:16,392
That's why I brought the entire company in
from the road,

263
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,009
because we're not taking it seriously.

264
00:23:18,095 --> 00:23:21,257
There is a methodology to what I do,
a reason it works.

265
00:23:21,343 --> 00:23:25,043
Coke and IBM have been doing this
for years. Familiar with them?

266
00:23:25,129 --> 00:23:29,917
Like anything else, it'll take a few months
of transition and everybody will settle in.

267
00:23:30,003 --> 00:23:32,361
Who are you taking off the road?
- How are you not getting this?

268
00:23:32,447 --> 00:23:35,734
You are grouned.
Everybody's grounded. It's done.

269
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,356
What we do here is brutal
and it does leave people devastated.

270
00:23:39,442 --> 00:23:41,912
But there is a dignity to the way I do it.

271
00:23:41,998 --> 00:23:45,126
By stabbing them in the chest
instead of the back, right?

272
00:23:45,212 --> 00:23:47,548
You wanted to see me?
- Well, uhm...

273
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:50,971
You know what? Yeah, come on in.
- Great job out there.

274
00:23:51,057 --> 00:23:54,378
Thank you. How's everyone taking it?
- Great.

275
00:23:54,464 --> 00:24:00,177
Listen, I admire your...zeal.
And I think you have some very good ideas.

276
00:24:00,263 --> 00:24:03,570
But you know nothing
about the realities of my industry.

277
00:24:03,656 --> 00:24:07,360
You can set up an iChat,
but you don't know how people think.

278
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:11,001
I minored in psychology.
- Nice.

279
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:15,095
OK, kiddo, fire me.
- Ryan...

280
00:24:15,181 --> 00:24:18,193
If she's gonna do this regularly, don't
you wanna know if she can fire people?

281
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:20,818
She's fired Ned.
- My dog can fire Ned. Fire me.

282
00:24:20,904 --> 00:24:24,730
You don't need to do this.
- No, it's OK. I got this.

283
00:24:25,349 --> 00:24:27,226
Mr Bingham,

284
00:24:27,312 --> 00:24:31,543
I regret to inform you that your position
at this company is no longer available.

285
00:24:31,629 --> 00:24:32,645
Hm. Who the hell are you?

286
00:24:32,731 --> 00:24:35,310
My name is Miss Keener. I'm here
today to discuss your future.

287
00:24:35,396 --> 00:24:37,892
My future? The only one who can fire me
is Craig Gregory.

288
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:40,830
He hired me to handle this for him.
- Handle what? Handle Me?

289
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:43,688
Mr. Gregory hired me,
he's the only one who can fire me.

290
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:47,190
Know what? I'm gonna go talk to him.
- Mr Bingham...

291
00:24:47,276 --> 00:24:49,966
No, no. You can't follow me.
You're on a computer screen, remember?

292
00:24:50,052 --> 00:24:52,335
Ryan..
- Let's try this again. Fire me again.

293
00:24:52,421 --> 00:24:54,594
I just did.
- Actually, you didn't. Fire me.

294
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,282
That's enough. We get it.

295
00:24:56,368 --> 00:25:00,712
Mr Bingham, I'm here to inform you
your position is no longer available.

296
00:25:01,187 --> 00:25:02,985
I'm fired?
- Yes, you're fired.

297
00:25:03,071 --> 00:25:05,092
Never say fired.
- You've been let go.

298
00:25:05,178 --> 00:25:06,588
Why?

299
00:25:06,674 --> 00:25:09,049
This is a mythical situation.
How could I possibly know why?

300
00:25:09,135 --> 00:25:11,369
Why doesn't matter,
you never know why.

301
00:25:11,455 --> 00:25:15,218
Don't focus on the why. Rather, spend
your energy thinking about your future.

302
00:25:15,304 --> 00:25:17,930
Well, I'm gonna spend
my energy on suing you

303
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,687
unless you give me a good
reason why you're firing me.

304
00:25:19,773 --> 00:25:21,410
Mr. Bingham, the reason's not important.

305
00:25:21,496 --> 00:25:24,234
You're firing me without grounds?
I have a lawsuit.

306
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,474
I get what you're trying to say, Ryan.
- Don't take this personally, Mr. Bingham.

307
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,908
Personally?

308
00:25:28,943 --> 00:25:31,807
This is the most personal situation
you are ever gonna enter,

309
00:25:31,893 --> 00:25:34,554
so before you try to revolutionise my business,

310
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,996
I'd like to know
that you actually know my business.

311
00:25:48,132 --> 00:25:51,137
That's a hell of a way
to welcome her to the team.

312
00:25:51,846 --> 00:25:55,434
Am I the only one that sees that by doing
this we're making ourselves irrelevant?

313
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,010
No, frankly,
we're making you irrelevant.

314
00:25:58,096 --> 00:25:59,888
Nice.
- Don't blame me.

315
00:25:59,974 --> 00:26:03,298
Blame high fuel costs, blame insurance
premiums, blame technology.

316
00:26:03,384 --> 00:26:06,821
Watch it. You're a little too young
to become a dinosaur.

317
00:26:06,907 --> 00:26:09,518
I'm not a dinosaur.
- I want you to show her the ropes.

318
00:26:09,604 --> 00:26:13,822
What do I know what goes on here?
Get Ferguson to do it.

319
00:26:13,908 --> 00:26:16,390
I'm not talking about here.

320
00:26:18,669 --> 00:26:19,948
No.
- Yeah.

321
00:26:20,034 --> 00:26:22,868
You're very confident
this girl doesn't know what she's doing. So...

322
00:26:22,954 --> 00:26:26,703
I'm sorry. I don't think a MySpace page
qualifies you to rewire a company.

323
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:30,588
Here's your chance. Go out, show her
the magic, take her through the paces.

324
00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:33,462
I'm not a fucking tour guide.

325
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:39,691
Now here we go.
- Bingham, here's the boat.

326
00:26:39,777 --> 00:26:42,823
And here's you.,
Do you want to be in the boat?

327
00:26:42,909 --> 00:26:45,306
Yeah, alone.

328
00:26:47,512 --> 00:26:49,212
We're ringing the bell,
we're rounding everybody up.

329
00:26:49,298 --> 00:26:53,025
You want to stay out a bit longer, you're
welcome, but you will not be alone. Ok?

330
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:56,130
You let me know.

331
00:27:11,341 --> 00:27:13,937
Oh, Christ.

332
00:28:03,457 --> 00:28:06,783
What?
- Follow me.

333
00:28:10,014 --> 00:28:13,116
I really like my luggage.
That's exactly what it is - luggage.

334
00:28:13,202 --> 00:28:15,087
Know how much time you lose
checking in?

335
00:28:15,173 --> 00:28:19,390
I don't know. Five...10 minutes?
- 35 minutes a flight.

336
00:28:19,476 --> 00:28:23,512
I travel 270 days a year.
That's 157 hours.

337
00:28:23,598 --> 00:28:29,012
That makes seven days.
Willing to throw away an entire week on that?

338
00:28:36,569 --> 00:28:39,967
You don't need this.
Sorry, you don't need that.

339
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:43,053
You don't need that.
They have neck pillows on the plane.

340
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:48,339
This - they have better ones there.
I'll get rid of this.

341
00:28:49,632 --> 00:28:52,315
I can just meet you at security.

342
00:28:52,401 --> 00:28:54,644
Thank you.

343
00:28:57,185 --> 00:28:59,539
Bingo - Asians.

344
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:03,354
You can't be serious.
- Never get behind people with infants.

345
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,108
I've never seen a stroller collapse
in less than 20 minutes.

346
00:29:06,194 --> 00:29:09,270
Old people are worse.
They're littered with hidden metal

347
00:29:09,356 --> 00:29:12,302
and they never appreciate
how little time they have left on earth.

348
00:29:12,388 --> 00:29:17,260
Five words: randomly selected
for additional screening.

349
00:29:17,378 --> 00:29:18,747
Asians, they pack light, travel efficiently,

350
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:23,306
and
they've got a thing for slip-on shoes.

351
00:29:23,392 --> 00:29:25,468
That's racist.
- I'm like my mother, I stereotype. It's faster.

352
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:47,224
What in your backpack?
Ryan Bigham.

353
00:29:56,263 --> 00:29:58,762
Are you mad at your computer?

354
00:29:58,848 --> 00:30:01,566
I type with purpose.

355
00:30:02,794 --> 00:30:06,004
What is it that you're working on
so furiously?

356
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:08,529
I'm building a workflow
of firing techniques.

357
00:30:08,615 --> 00:30:12,449
It's questions and responses,
actions and reactions.

358
00:30:12,535 --> 00:30:15,077
A script taking you through the steps
of firing someone.

359
00:30:15,163 --> 00:30:16,729
Who's it for?

360
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,974
Well, theoretically,

361
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:22,207
you could put it in the hands
of anyone and they'd be downsizing immediately.

362
00:30:22,293 --> 00:30:24,889
All you have to do is follow the steps.

363
00:30:25,567 --> 00:30:28,464
Natalie,
what is it you think we do here?

364
00:30:28,687 --> 00:30:31,861
We prepare the newly-unemployed for
the emotional and physical hurdles of job hunting,

365
00:30:31,947 --> 00:30:33,533
while minimising legal blowback.

366
00:30:33,619 --> 00:30:36,250
That's what we're selling.
It's not what we're doing.

367
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:40,859
OK, what are we doing?
- We are here to make limbo tolerable,

368
00:30:40,945 --> 00:30:49,445
to ferry wounded souls across the river of dread
until the point where hope is dimly visible.

369
00:30:50,965 --> 00:30:55,073
Then stop the boat, shove 'em
in the water and make 'em swim.

370
00:30:55,245 --> 00:30:59,369
That's really impressive.
Are you gonna put that in your book?

371
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:13,921
I gotta grab this.
I'll meet you at the car rental.

372
00:31:14,007 --> 00:31:15,737
Hey, I was hoping I'd hear from you.

373
00:31:15,823 --> 00:31:18,903
I'm in Hotlanta and I need
a rib-joint recommend bad.

374
00:31:18,989 --> 00:31:21,457
Fat Matt's. Bring a bib.

375
00:31:21,543 --> 00:31:25,294
You never called.
- I wasn't sure what was appropriate.

376
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:29,229
Appropriate? I'm not some waitress
you banged in a snowstorm.

377
00:31:29,315 --> 00:31:32,713
That word has no place
in our vocabulary.

378
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,478
I'm the woman that you don't have
to worry about.

379
00:31:36,889 --> 00:31:40,370
Sounds like a trap.
- Listen...

380
00:31:40,461 --> 00:31:43,162
the next time that you're worried
about manners, don't.

381
00:31:43,248 --> 00:31:48,774
If you wanna call, call.
Just think of me as yourself, only with a vagina.

382
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,227
When am I gonna see you?

383
00:31:51,313 --> 00:31:57,550
Well, I'm out of Hartsfield into IAD,
with a connection in ORD into SDF.

384
00:31:57,636 --> 00:31:59,027
Sorry.

385
00:31:59,113 --> 00:32:01,080
Yeah, tell me about it.

386
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:06,227
How long's your layover? They got
multiples into SDF. Could you push?

387
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:10,239
Yeah, I can push.

388
00:32:22,014 --> 00:32:25,291
All you have to do today
is watch and listen.

389
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:29,694
And when I talk about a strategy
packet, hand them one of those.

390
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,052
Sounds great.

391
00:32:31,138 --> 00:32:34,440
So although I wish I were here
with better news,

392
00:32:34,526 --> 00:32:38,493
the fact is that you and I are
sitting here today because

393
00:32:38,579 --> 00:32:42,059
this will be your last week
of employment at this company.

394
00:32:42,145 --> 00:32:44,107
Why me?
- What am I supposed to do now?

395
00:32:44,193 --> 00:32:47,407
Am I supposed to feel better
I'm not the only one losing my job?

396
00:32:47,493 --> 00:32:51,656
This is ridiculous!
I have been a fine employee for over 10 years

397
00:32:51,742 --> 00:32:54,350
and this is the way you treat me.

398
00:32:54,436 --> 00:32:57,652
How do you sleep at night, man?
How?

399
00:32:57,738 --> 00:33:00,420
How's your family?
They sleeping well at night?

400
00:33:00,506 --> 00:33:02,596
Electricity still on?

401
00:33:02,682 --> 00:33:06,311
Heat still on, refrigerator full of food?

402
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,718
Gas tank full of gas?

403
00:33:08,804 --> 00:33:10,977
Going to Chuck E. Cheese
this weekend or something?

404
00:33:11,063 --> 00:33:13,123
Not me.

405
00:33:13,351 --> 00:33:16,619
No, my kids,
we're not gonna do anything.

406
00:33:20,494 --> 00:33:23,531
What do you suggest I tell them?

407
00:33:28,068 --> 00:33:30,103
Perhaps you're underestimating
the positive effect

408
00:33:30,189 --> 00:33:33,141
your career transition
can have on your children.

409
00:33:33,227 --> 00:33:36,257
The positive effect?

410
00:33:36,574 --> 00:33:39,548
I make about 90 grand a year now.

411
00:33:39,758 --> 00:33:42,860
Unemployment is what -
250 bucks a week?

412
00:33:42,946 --> 00:33:45,260
Is that one of your positive effects?

413
00:33:45,346 --> 00:33:48,941
We'll get to be cosier cos I'm not gonna
be able to pay my mortgage on my house.

414
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:53,743
So maybe we can move into a nice
fucking one-bedroom apartment somewhere.

415
00:33:54,036 --> 00:33:56,088
And I guess without benefits,

416
00:33:56,174 --> 00:34:01,095
I'll be able to hold my daughter as she,
you know, suffers from her asthma

417
00:34:01,181 --> 00:34:04,231
that I won't be able to afford
the medication for.

418
00:34:04,317 --> 00:34:09,147
Well...tests have shown that children under
moderate trauma have a tendency to

419
00:34:09,233 --> 00:34:12,057
apply themselves academically...

420
00:34:12,318 --> 00:34:15,083
..as a method of coping.

421
00:34:15,478 --> 00:34:18,203
Go fuck yourself.

422
00:34:18,518 --> 00:34:20,804
That's what my kids'll think.

423
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:25,158
Your children's admiration is important to you?
- Yeah.

424
00:34:25,244 --> 00:34:27,913
Yeah, it was.

425
00:34:28,154 --> 00:34:30,213
Well, I doubt they ever admired you,
Bob.

426
00:34:30,299 --> 00:34:34,226
Hey, asshole, aren't you supposed
to be consoling me?

427
00:34:34,312 --> 00:34:37,197
I'm not a shrink, Bob.
I'm a wake-up call.

428
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:41,058
You know why kids love athletes?
- Cos they screw lingerie models?

429
00:34:41,144 --> 00:34:45,322
No, that's why we love athletes.
Kids love athletes

430
00:34:45,408 --> 00:34:47,869
because they follow their dreams.

431
00:34:49,656 --> 00:34:52,967
Well, I can't dunk.
- No, but you can cook.

432
00:34:53,053 --> 00:34:54,680
What are you talking about?

433
00:34:54,766 --> 00:34:59,253
Your résum?says that you minored
in French culinary arts.

434
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:02,134
Most students,
they work on the fryer at KFC,

435
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,566
but you bussed tables
at Il Picador to support yourself.

436
00:35:05,652 --> 00:35:09,374
Then you get out of college
and then you come and work here.

437
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:13,016
How much did they first pay you
to give up on your dreams?

438
00:35:13,102 --> 00:35:16,654
27 grand a year.
- And when were you going to stop

439
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:20,337
and come back
and do what makes you happy?

440
00:35:21,656 --> 00:35:23,066
Good question.

441
00:35:23,152 --> 00:35:26,955
I see guys who work at the same
company for their entire lives,

442
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,992
guys exactly like you.

443
00:35:29,078 --> 00:35:34,433
They clock in, they clock out,
and they never have a moment of happiness.

444
00:35:35,644 --> 00:35:38,807
You have an opportunity here, Bob.

445
00:35:39,017 --> 00:35:41,225
This is a rebirth.

446
00:35:41,468 --> 00:35:45,424
If not for you, do it for your children.

447
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,158
He just waltzes in and cuts in line?

448
00:36:16,244 --> 00:36:20,044
We reserve priority assistance
for our Hilton Honors members.

449
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:23,299
The promotions are great.
You should check it out.

450
00:36:28,684 --> 00:36:30,592
Hungry much?

451
00:36:30,678 --> 00:36:34,272
Our business expense
allots $40 each for dinner.

452
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,029
I plan on grabbing
as many miles as I can.

453
00:36:37,115 --> 00:36:40,721
OK, you gotta fill me in on the miles
thing. What is that about?

454
00:36:40,807 --> 00:36:44,158
Are you talking about...
like frequent flyer miles?

455
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:47,849
You really want to know?
- I'm dying to know.

456
00:36:47,935 --> 00:36:53,086
I don't spend a nickel if I can help it
unless it somehow profits my mileage account.

457
00:36:53,172 --> 00:36:55,969
So what are you saving up for -
Hawaii, South of France?

458
00:36:56,055 --> 00:36:59,800
It's not like that.
The miles are the goal.

459
00:36:59,886 --> 00:37:01,654
That's it?

460
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,167
You're saving just to save?

461
00:37:03,253 --> 00:37:06,031
Just say I have a number in mind
and I haven't hit it yet.

462
00:37:06,117 --> 00:37:09,457
That's a little abstract.
What's the target?

463
00:37:09,628 --> 00:37:14,049
I'd rather not.
- Is it a secret target?

464
00:37:14,504 --> 00:37:17,486
It's 10 million miles.

465
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,150
OK. Isn't 10 million just a number?
- Pi's just a number.

466
00:37:21,236 --> 00:37:23,485
Well, we all need a hobby.

467
00:37:23,712 --> 00:37:29,072
No, I... I don't mean to belittle your collection.
I get it. It sounds cool.

468
00:37:29,158 --> 00:37:32,619
I'd be the seventh person to do it.
More people have walked on the moon.

469
00:37:32,705 --> 00:37:37,120
Do they throw you a parade?
- You get lifetime executive status,

470
00:37:37,206 --> 00:37:39,573
you get to meet the chief pilot,
Maynard Finch...

471
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:41,173
And they put your name on a plane.

472
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,188
Men get hard-ons putting their name on stuff.
You guy;s dont grow up.

473
00:37:44,274 --> 00:37:47,013
It's like you need to pee on everything.
- Now who's stereotyping?

474
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:51,251
Fear of mortality. It's like,
yeah, you're gonna die one day.

475
00:37:51,337 --> 00:37:53,624
Why is that singular to men?

476
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:58,019
Probably because you can't have babies.
- The baby argument.

477
00:38:01,483 --> 00:38:03,920
If I had that many miles...

478
00:38:04,006 --> 00:38:05,456
I would show up at an airport,

479
00:38:05,542 --> 00:38:09,955
look at the destination board,
pick a place and go.

480
00:38:28,955 --> 00:38:31,239
Can't fall asleep.

481
00:38:36,418 --> 00:38:39,116
Me too just laying here

482
00:38:42,026 --> 00:38:44,370
You should rub one out.

483
00:38:44,888 --> 00:38:47,759
Thank you for the advice.

484
00:38:49,442 --> 00:38:53,999
Only fair if you do too

485
00:38:59,213 --> 00:39:04,621
Way ahead of you.

486
00:39:11,036 --> 00:39:14,477
Call me next tim so I can listen

487
00:39:17,317 --> 00:39:20,677
Have sweet dreams about me.

488
00:39:28,987 --> 00:39:33,553
OK. Closer.
Way closer.

489
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,596
Still closer.

490
00:39:36,682 --> 00:39:39,611
Closer.

491
00:39:40,538 --> 00:39:42,200
Er...a little left.

492
00:39:42,286 --> 00:39:44,395
Down a little.

493
00:39:44,481 --> 00:39:48,295
Too far. Up. Up one more inch.

494
00:39:49,098 --> 00:39:51,661
I don't get it. Why does your sister
want a fake photo?

495
00:39:51,747 --> 00:39:55,945
My sister is kooky. She thinks
this is charming. It's like the gnome thing.

496
00:39:56,031 --> 00:39:59,252
No, I mean, why would she want a fake photo
in front of St Louis airport?

497
00:39:59,338 --> 00:40:02,885
Are you kidding - Lambert Field?
The Wright brothers flew through there.

498
00:40:02,971 --> 00:40:05,124
That domed main terminal,

499
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:09,333
is the first of its kind, a precursor
of everything from JFK to de Gaulle.

500
00:40:09,419 --> 00:40:12,998
Pretty sweet.
- Just take the picture.

501
00:40:15,488 --> 00:40:17,724
Well, that's a keeper.

502
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:19,935
Let me see it.

503
00:40:20,566 --> 00:40:24,777
Why she wants reminders of all the
places she hasn't been is beyond me.

504
00:40:24,863 --> 00:40:27,105
I'm sure she'll be crushed
for having missed this airport.

505
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:31,452
Before Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic,
he took off from that runway.

506
00:40:31,538 --> 00:40:33,461
Wonder why they called it
the Spirit of St Louis?

507
00:40:33,547 --> 00:40:36,431
No.
- Well...

508
00:40:43,626 --> 00:40:46,517
Do you know how fucked
this place is now?

509
00:40:46,603 --> 00:40:48,827
I am the one thing - the one thing-

510
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:53,069
preventing this place
from being totally fucked in the ass.

511
00:40:58,996 --> 00:41:01,977
Sometimes they just need to vent.

512
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:07,927
Please, for the love of God,
can I fire the next one?

513
00:41:08,084 --> 00:41:12,119
Miss Barnes, thank you for joining us.
- I'm here to be fired, right?

514
00:41:13,027 --> 00:41:15,169
Well, we're here
to talk about your future.

515
00:41:15,255 --> 00:41:17,722
You don't have to sugar-coat it.
I get the drill.

516
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,332
What are they offering?

517
00:41:20,418 --> 00:41:23,025
Inside the packet, you'll find a clearly
worked out severance package.

518
00:41:23,111 --> 00:41:25,740
Give me the bullet points.

519
00:41:25,931 --> 00:41:27,349
It's actually pretty good -

520
00:41:27,435 --> 00:41:29,797
three months' pay, six months' medical.

521
00:41:29,883 --> 00:41:32,885
And a full year of placement services
through our CTC.

522
00:41:32,971 --> 00:41:36,955
Placement services. That's generous.

523
00:41:38,733 --> 00:41:42,801
Commonly it takes a month of searching
for every $10,000 you expect to earn in salary.

524
00:41:42,887 --> 00:41:46,090
So I could be looking for a while.
- Not necessarily.

525
00:41:46,176 --> 00:41:50,311
Don't even sweat it.
I'm pretty confident about my plans.

526
00:41:50,397 --> 00:41:52,203
Really?
- Yeah.

527
00:41:52,289 --> 00:41:55,571
There's this beautiful bridge
by my house.

528
00:41:55,923 --> 00:41:58,995
I'm gonna go jump off it.

529
00:41:59,936 --> 00:42:01,494
Natalie.

530
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,886
Hey!

531
00:42:02,972 --> 00:42:05,105
Natalie!

532
00:42:13,402 --> 00:42:16,845
People say these things all the time.
It's part of the trade.

533
00:42:16,931 --> 00:42:19,373
They do?
- Yeah.

534
00:42:19,459 --> 00:42:24,902
They say crazy things.
They get worked up.

535
00:42:24,988 --> 00:42:27,638
She was really calm.

536
00:42:27,724 --> 00:42:30,121
I think that's a good sign.

537
00:42:30,404 --> 00:42:35,013
So they don't ever actually do it?
- No. No, it's just talk.

538
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:39,971
How do you know? Do you follow up?
- No, nothing good's gonna come of that, but..

539
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:43,929
I wouldn't worry about it.

540
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:51,419
This is what we do, Natalie. We take people
at their most fragile and we set them adrift.

541
00:42:55,201 --> 00:42:57,817
Ready to go back in?

542
00:42:58,236 --> 00:43:01,121
All right, let's go. Come on.

543
00:43:44,796 --> 00:43:48,752
No, I'm fine. Tell me something sweet.

544
00:43:48,931 --> 00:43:53,167
I'll be back soon. I'm not sure how long
this exercise is supposed to last.

545
00:43:53,253 --> 00:43:57,211
No, I don't even think of him that way.
He's old.

546
00:44:37,102 --> 00:44:40,519
I- I'm done?
- I wasn't expecting this. Not at all.

547
00:44:40,605 --> 00:44:41,609
Just like that?

548
00:44:41,695 --> 00:44:45,477
I'm disappointed that I've given
so much of my life...

549
00:44:45,563 --> 00:44:46,623
This is not fair.

550
00:44:46,709 --> 00:44:49,192
There are people way more qualified
than me now.

551
00:44:49,278 --> 00:44:52,965
I don't know what to do
when I wake up tomorrow.

552
00:44:59,468 --> 00:45:01,729
You OK?

553
00:45:02,988 --> 00:45:06,167
Are we going?
- Yeah.

554
00:45:23,154 --> 00:45:26,677
This is how I start every day of my life.

555
00:45:28,363 --> 00:45:31,686
Now, this is gonna be a little difficult,
so stay with me.

556
00:45:31,772 --> 00:45:33,698
You have a new backpack.

557
00:45:33,784 --> 00:45:37,422
Only this time,
I want you to fill it with people.

558
00:45:37,508 --> 00:45:41,277
Start with casual acquaintances,
friends of friends,

559
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:43,031
folks around the office.

560
00:45:43,117 --> 00:45:46,499
And then the people you trust
with your most intimate secrets -

561
00:45:46,585 --> 00:45:49,018
your cousins, your aunts, your uncles,

562
00:45:49,104 --> 00:45:52,848
your brothers, your sisters,
your parents,

563
00:45:52,934 --> 00:45:58,387
and finally your husband, your wife,
your boyfriend or your girlfriend.

564
00:45:59,028 --> 00:46:02,029
You get them into that backpack.

565
00:46:03,332 --> 00:46:07,209
Don't worry. I'm not gonna ask you
to light it on fire.

566
00:46:08,494 --> 00:46:10,646
Feel the weight of that bag.

567
00:46:10,732 --> 00:46:16,457
Make no mistake, your relationships are
the heaviest components in your life.

568
00:46:16,932 --> 00:46:21,639
Do you feel the straps
cutting into your shoulders?

569
00:46:22,204 --> 00:46:28,705
All those negotiations and arguments,
and secrets and compromises.

570
00:46:31,228 --> 00:46:33,987
You don't need to carry all that weight.

571
00:46:34,425 --> 00:46:37,274
Why don't you set that bag down?

572
00:46:38,836 --> 00:46:44,734
Some animals were meant to carry each other,
to live symbiotically for a lifetime -

573
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:50,137
star-crossed lovers, monogamous swans.
We are not those animals.

574
00:46:51,884 --> 00:46:54,113
The slower we move, the faster we die.

575
00:46:54,199 --> 00:46:57,893
We are not swans.

576
00:46:58,484 --> 00:47:00,868
We're sharks.

577
00:47:14,228 --> 00:47:16,140
Never?
- No.

578
00:47:16,226 --> 00:47:18,330
Ever?
- No.

579
00:47:18,416 --> 00:47:20,787
You never want to get married?
- Nope.

580
00:47:20,873 --> 00:47:22,917
Never want kids?
- Not a chance.

581
00:47:23,003 --> 00:47:25,681
Ever?
- Never.

582
00:47:25,767 --> 00:47:29,106
Is that so bizarre?
- Yes.

583
00:47:29,192 --> 00:47:33,460
Yes, it is.
- I just don't see the value in it.

584
00:47:33,874 --> 00:47:36,501
Right, sell it to me.
- What?

585
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:38,847
Sell me marriage.

586
00:47:40,138 --> 00:47:43,645
OK, how about love?
- OK.

587
00:47:43,948 --> 00:47:48,543
Stability, just somebody you can count on...
- How many stable marriages do you know?

588
00:47:48,629 --> 00:47:51,903
Somebody to talk to,
someone to spend your life with.

589
00:47:51,989 --> 00:47:55,689
I'm surrounded by people to talk to.
That won't change.

590
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,229
How about just not dying alone?

591
00:47:59,672 --> 00:48:03,703
Starting when I was 12, we moved each
of my grandparents to a nursing facility.

592
00:48:03,789 --> 00:48:08,357
My parents went the same way.
Make no mistake, we all die alone.

593
00:48:08,443 --> 00:48:13,239
Now, those cult members in San Diego,
with the Kool-Aid and the sneakers...

594
00:48:13,325 --> 00:48:15,456
they didn't die alone.

595
00:48:15,542 --> 00:48:18,203
I'm just saying there are options.

596
00:48:20,974 --> 00:48:23,335
Oh, fuck.

597
00:48:23,966 --> 00:48:26,667
Brian left me.

598
00:48:32,588 --> 00:48:35,025
All right.

599
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,717
OK. Ok. All right.

600
00:48:40,954 --> 00:48:44,295
All right. Shh, shh.

601
00:48:56,959 --> 00:49:01,101
Natalie, this is Alex, my friend.
This is Natalie.

602
00:49:01,554 --> 00:49:03,858
I should give you both a moment.

603
00:49:03,944 --> 00:49:09,261
No. No, that's fine.
I'm fine. It's a pleasure to meet you.

604
00:49:09,558 --> 00:49:13,705
Maybe we should just all
go up to our rooms and freshen up.

605
00:49:13,791 --> 00:49:16,175
Maybe a drink?
- Now you're talking.

606
00:49:16,261 --> 00:49:18,995
Brian: I think it's time we C othter people

607
00:49:19,645 --> 00:49:21,973
He broke up with you
with a text message?

608
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:25,525
Kind of like firing someone
over the internet.

609
00:49:27,032 --> 00:49:30,601
What a weaselly prick.
- But what does that make me?

610
00:49:30,724 --> 00:49:33,122
Someone who falls for a prick.
- We all fall for them.

611
00:49:33,208 --> 00:49:36,017
Pricks are
spontaneous, unpredictable and fun.

612
00:49:36,103 --> 00:49:39,095
Then we're surprised
when they turn out to be pricks.

613
00:49:39,466 --> 00:49:43,547
I followed him to Omaha.
- You did?

614
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:48,265
I had a job waiting for me in San Francisco
when he got an offer from ConAgra.

615
00:49:49,044 --> 00:49:51,801
He said we could start a life together.

616
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:56,125
So I followed him.
- To Nebraska?

617
00:49:58,234 --> 00:50:01,471
I thought I'd be engaged by now.

618
00:50:01,712 --> 00:50:03,163
No offence.

619
00:50:03,249 --> 00:50:05,493
None taken.
- That's all right.

620
00:50:06,745 --> 00:50:10,291
When I was 16,
I thought by 23 I'd be married,

621
00:50:10,377 --> 00:50:15,006
maybe have a kid, corner office by day,
entertaining at night.

622
00:50:15,092 --> 00:50:17,263
I was supposed to be driving
a Grand Cherokee by now.

623
00:50:17,349 --> 00:50:20,406
Life can underwhelm you that way.

624
00:50:20,492 --> 00:50:23,793
I mean, where did you
think you'd be by um...

625
00:50:26,088 --> 00:50:29,911
It doesn't work that way.
- At a certain point, you stop with the deadlines.

626
00:50:29,997 --> 00:50:31,458
It can be counterproductive.

627
00:50:31,544 --> 00:50:33,525
I don't want to say anything
anti-feminist.

628
00:50:33,611 --> 00:50:36,958
I really appreciate
all your generation did for me.

629
00:50:37,044 --> 00:50:38,851
It was our pleasure.
- Well done.

630
00:50:38,937 --> 00:50:41,763
But sometimes it feels like,
no matter how much success I have,

631
00:50:41,849 --> 00:50:44,861
it's not gonna matter
until I find the right guy.

632
00:50:45,418 --> 00:50:48,054
You really thought
this guy was the one?

633
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,503
I could have made it work.

634
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:53,651
He um... He really fit the bill.

635
00:50:53,737 --> 00:50:56,027
You know?
- The bill?

636
00:50:56,113 --> 00:50:58,596
White collar, college grad.

637
00:50:58,682 --> 00:51:02,787
Loves dogs, likes funny movies.
Six-foot-one, brown hair, kind eyes,

638
00:51:02,873 --> 00:51:08,381
works in finance but is outdoorsy...
you know, on the weekends.

639
00:51:08,668 --> 00:51:14,569
I always imagined he'd have a single
syllable name like Matt or John...

640
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:16,619
or Dave.

641
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:19,659
In a perfect world, he drives a 4Runner, and

642
00:51:19,745 --> 00:51:22,745
and the only thing he loves
more than me is his golden lab.

643
00:51:23,285 --> 00:51:26,059
And a nice smile.

644
00:51:28,264 --> 00:51:32,301
What about you?
- Let me think.

645
00:51:33,794 --> 00:51:38,602
Honestly, by the time you're 34, all the
physical requirements go out the window.

646
00:51:38,688 --> 00:51:42,441
Like you secretly pray
that he'll be taller than you.

647
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:47,797
Not an asshole would be nice. Someone who
enjoys my company, comes from a good family.

648
00:51:47,883 --> 00:51:50,009
You don't think about that
when you're younger.

649
00:51:50,095 --> 00:51:54,215
I don't know...
someone who wants kids.

650
00:51:54,301 --> 00:51:57,316
Likes kids. Wants kids

651
00:51:57,402 --> 00:52:01,359
Healthy enough to play with his kids.

652
00:52:03,154 --> 00:52:06,510
Please let him earn more money
than I do.

653
00:52:06,596 --> 00:52:09,671
You might not understand that now,
but believe me, you will one day.

654
00:52:09,757 --> 00:52:12,927
Otherwise that's a recipe for disaster.

655
00:52:14,378 --> 00:52:17,000
And hopefully some hair on his head.

656
00:52:17,086 --> 00:52:20,901
But I mean even that's not
a deal breaker these days.

657
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:26,407
A nice smile.

658
00:52:27,698 --> 00:52:31,815
Yeah, a nice smile.
Nice smile just might do it.

659
00:52:34,136 --> 00:52:36,531
Wow, that was depressing.

660
00:52:37,782 --> 00:52:41,021
I should just date women.
- Tried it.

661
00:52:41,198 --> 00:52:43,835
We're no picnic ourselves.

662
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:49,861
I don't mind being married
to my career.

663
00:52:50,577 --> 00:52:53,785
And I don't expect it to hold me in bed
as I fall asleep.

664
00:52:57,836 --> 00:53:00,604
I just don't want to settle.

665
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:04,663
You're young. Right now you see
settling as some sort of a failure.

666
00:53:04,749 --> 00:53:08,492
It is...by definition.

667
00:53:08,578 --> 00:53:12,544
But by the time someone is right
for you, it won't feel like settling.

668
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:14,141
And the only person left to judge you

669
00:53:14,227 --> 00:53:17,751
will be the 23-year-old girl
with a target on your back.

670
00:53:21,393 --> 00:53:24,103
So what's the plan for the evening?

671
00:53:24,426 --> 00:53:28,797
Well, we were gonna hit that party
for the tech conference at the hotel.

672
00:53:28,883 --> 00:53:32,603
I didn't know you could just attend
those. I thought you had to register.

673
00:53:32,689 --> 00:53:35,467
Technically,
I don't think it's open to the public.

674
00:53:35,553 --> 00:53:39,979
Stop by.
- You're gonna crash it?

675
00:53:42,935 --> 00:53:48,206
have a good time, usually.
- No, no, I get it. I'm in.

676
00:54:07,904 --> 00:54:10,208
Jennifer Chu?

677
00:54:10,294 --> 00:54:13,328
Shit!
- Ah, it'll be fine.

678
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:37,388
Doing all right?

679
00:54:38,353 --> 00:54:41,470
Yeah. This was a great idea.

680
00:54:42,689 --> 00:54:45,162
You're so pretty.

681
00:54:45,445 --> 00:54:49,067
You're exactly
what I wanna look like in 15 years.

682
00:54:49,342 --> 00:54:52,952
Thank you, Natalie.
- You should dance.

683
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:57,565
Come on.
- No, no, no.

684
00:54:57,651 --> 00:55:00,399
Come on.
- Oh!

685
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:20,253
I'm Dave.
- I'm Natalie.

686
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,821
Who's Jennifer?

687
00:55:23,637 --> 00:55:24,895
I don't know.

688
00:55:26,068 --> 00:55:29,185
How's everybody doing out there?

689
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:34,242
Right about now, give it up
for a very special alphaTECH guest.

690
00:55:34,328 --> 00:55:38,012
Young MC!

691
00:55:38,528 --> 00:55:40,642
What's up, alphaTECH?

692
00:55:40,728 --> 00:55:44,774
I got a busted computer.
Can somebody fix it for me?

693
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:36,730
I want you to have a key to my place.

694
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:42,110
Wow. I had no idea we were at that point in our relationship.

695
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:45,030
Oh,yes. - Wow.

696
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:51,070
Where is she?

697
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:28,340
Back home I don't get to act the way I do with you.

698
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:32,390
That's why I don't have a back home. - I know.

699
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:37,540
You're so cool. Mr Empty Backpack.

700
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,080
You know about my backpack? - I Googled you.

701
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,200
You did?

702
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:44,860
It's what us modern girls do when we have a crush.

703
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:47,610
Does it bother you? - It depends.

704
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:52,490
Is the bag empty because you hate people or because you hate the baggage they come along with?

705
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:55,070
I don't hate people. I'm not exactly a hermit.

706
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:59,850
You just don't want to be tied down with the whole responsibility thing.

707
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:03,160
I don't know what originally sparked the backpack.

708
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:06,150
Probably needed to be alone.

709
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:11,260
Recently,I've been thinking that I needed to empty the backpack

710
00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:14,370
before I know what to put back in it.

711
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:36,790
Oh,no! - I think we're out of gas.

712
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:19,090
Hey. You're up?

713
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:22,960
I have to fly standby and make a meeting in Cincinnati.

714
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:29,660
I made you feel cheap.

715
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:33,680
It's all right. Just leave the money on the dresser.

716
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:37,810
I'll text you later so we can swap schedules.

717
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,180
I really like you.

718
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:50,810
I like you too. - Good.

719
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:54,950
Go catch your plane.

720
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:08,620
Last night er...

721
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:12,860
It was kind of out of hand. I said things erm...

722
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,260
I'm not actually sure everything that I said.

723
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:19,570
But I didn't want you to think... - Just relax.

724
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:22,390
It was nice to see you cut loose.

725
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:25,360
Did you wake him up or slip out?

726
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,570
What? - This morning. Your new friend.

727
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:31,510
Did you wake him up for an awkward goodbye,or did you

728
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:35,130
just slip out and make him feel like a whore?

729
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:40,150
I just left. - Protocol's always tricky.

730
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:44,220
What happened to Alex?

731
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,410
She had to leave town early to get to a meeting.

732
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:50,590
That's too bad. Where's she live? - Chicago.

733
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:52,550
Thinking of going to see her?

734
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:56,740
We don't really have that kind of relationship. Try it over there.

735
01:00:56,890 --> 01:01:00,600
What erm... kind of relationship do you have?

736
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:03,950
Well,you know...casual.

737
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:08,290
Sounds pretty special. - It works for us.

738
01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:11,210
Don't you think there's a future there?

739
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:13,800
I never thought about it. What's going on?

740
01:01:13,890 --> 01:01:16,810
Really never thought about it? - No.

741
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:20,070
How can you not think about that?

742
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:23,860
How does it not cross your mind you might want a future with someone?

743
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:27,060
It's simple. You know that moment when you look into somebody's eyes

744
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:32,630
and you can feel them staring into your soul and the whole world goes quiet just for a second?

745
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:36,040
Yes. - Right. Well,I don't.

746
01:01:36,350 --> 01:01:37,920
You're an asshole.

747
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,240
I'm just dicking around. Give me a hand. - Shouldn't you give her a chance?

748
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,800
A chance for what? - A chance at something real.

749
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,760
Natalie,your definition of real will evolve as you get older.

750
01:01:47,850 --> 01:01:52,270
Can you stop condescending for one second or is it a principle of your bullshit philosophy?

751
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:55,190
Bullshit philosophy? - The isolation,the travelling.

752
01:01:55,270 --> 01:01:57,780
Is that supposed to be charming? - No,it's a life choice.

753
01:01:57,870 --> 01:02:01,110
It's a cocoon of self-banishment. - Wow. Big words.

754
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:04,720
Screw you. - Screw you,too.

755
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:09,060
You have set up a way of life that makes it impossible for you to have any human connection.

756
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:14,050
And this woman comes along and runs the gauntlet of your life choice,

757
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:17,290
and comes out on the other end smiling just so you can call her "casual"?

758
01:02:17,370 --> 01:02:21,120
I need to grow up? You're a 12-year-old.

759
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,010
I don't have a gauntlet...

760
01:02:26,270 --> 01:02:28,480
Fuck.

761
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:12,530
Listen,these Detroit guys can be tough. They're getting hammered.

762
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:14,730
Don't get distracted. Stick with the simple stuff.

763
01:03:14,810 --> 01:03:19,120
Get these packets in their hands and get them out the door,OK?

764
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:34,210
Hey,welcome to Detroit.

765
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:36,060
What's going on here?

766
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:40,140
I've been looking at those great numbers. I thought we should nut up and give this a try.

767
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:41,720
We could use a little more time.

768
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:44,520
You gotta leave the nest at some point,huh?

769
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:47,410
This a real company,Craig. We're here to do some damage.

770
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:51,190
I know. It's a good thing we brought our best. Let's stop screwing around.

771
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:54,370
Just give me a minute to prepare and get my things together.

772
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:57,230
I thought Natalie was going to take this one.

773
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,420
She's hardly ready for that.

774
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:01,520
I've watched her results the last few days. She's great.

775
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:03,250
This is a whole other animal.

776
01:04:03,330 --> 01:04:08,220
You know,she created it,right? Natalie,are you not up for it?

777
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:10,850
Yeah,I'm game.

778
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:13,270
That's my girl.

779
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:17,720
Just remember,don't apologise or tell them how hard this is for you.

780
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:22,780
Today's one of the worst days they're ever gonna have. How we feel doesn't even compare.

781
01:04:23,890 --> 01:04:28,250
Got it. - Keep it professional. You'll be fine.

782
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:33,300
What's all this? What's going on?

783
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:35,240
Hello,Mr Samuels.

784
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:38,430
I wish I were here with better news.

785
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:42,780
However,your position here is no longer available.

786
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,850
What are you talking about?

787
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:48,840
You've been let go.

788
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:51,300
Just like that?

789
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,850
Who are you?

790
01:04:55,600 --> 01:05:00,100
My name is Miss Keener and I'm here today to talk about your options.

791
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:06,350
I worked for this company for 17 years and they send a 4th-grader to can me?

792
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:09,850
What the fuck is this?

793
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,910
It's perfectly normal to be upset.

794
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,440
However,the sooner you can tell yourself greater opportunities...

795
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:28,810
Greater opportunities? I'm 57 fucking years old.

796
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:35,640
Anybody who ever built an empire or changed the world sat where you are now.

797
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,500
And it's because they sat there that they were able to do it.

798
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:49,820
There's a packet in front of you. I want you to take some time and review it.

799
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:54,580
All the answers you're looking for are inside those pages.

800
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:03,230
The sooner you trust the process,the sooner the next step of your life will unveil itself.

801
01:06:11,130 --> 01:06:15,120
I need you to go back to your office and put together your personal things.

802
01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:36,980
Mr Samuels, that's all we can discuss now.

803
01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:43,060
Mr Samuels.

804
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,600
Mr Samuels.

805
01:06:56,910 --> 01:06:59,500
Mr Samuels!

806
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:16,720
You did good.

807
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:21,220
You OK? You want me to take over?

808
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,600
No,I'm all right.

809
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:44,200
Look,we just got here. That's one place. We need to try a few more.

810
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:48,480
Maybe it makes no difference,but it's comforting to know we're in the next room.

811
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:51,830
I know you don't give a shit about my comfort.

812
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:55,890
I think we could try a few more, that's all I'm saying.

813
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:01,150
Fine.

814
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:07,480
All right. OK. All right.

815
01:08:12,850 --> 01:08:16,070
He thought you did a great job. You did.

816
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:20,450
I'm real proud of you. - Thanks.

817
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:25,140
They're pulling us off the road.

818
01:08:26,190 --> 01:08:28,140
We're going home.

819
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:33,720
Really? For good - Yeah.

820
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:37,930
Good job.

821
01:08:57,450 --> 01:08:59,680
We request the pleasure of your company at the wedding of Julie Bingham and James Arthur Miller

822
01:09:03,010 --> 01:09:06,210
I'm sorry about what I said about Alex. That was out of line.

823
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:08,470
It's all right. I understand.

824
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:11,980
I mean,who am I to be doling out relationship advice,right?

825
01:09:12,070 --> 01:09:14,580
No kidding.

826
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:20,600
Are you gonna be OK?

827
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:24,310
What do you mean? - In Omaha?

828
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,820
I don't know.

829
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:32,320
It's better than you'd think.

830
01:09:41,490 --> 01:09:42,850
Ryan.

831
01:09:42,930 --> 01:09:47,150
Ryan. Where are you going? - I'm grabbing another flight.

832
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:51,580
Something I've got to take care of. I'll see you back at home.

833
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:12,530
OK,walk it in a little.

834
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:14,580
A little more.

835
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:18,380
There you go. Yeah.

836
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,890
Got it.

837
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:27,620
They're a cute couple.

838
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:30,960
You think so? - Yeah,they'll make cute kids.

839
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:35,670
How do you like Wisconsin in February?

840
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:39,920
I like it if you're there. I know a killer burger in Milwaukee.

841
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:41,810
Northern Wisconsin.

842
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,330
What are you doing this weekend?

843
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:48,900
No. - What,I haven't...

844
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:53,230
You want me to be your date? - Yeah. Yeah.

845
01:10:53,310 --> 01:10:56,840
At your sister's wedding? - It's not like I know her that well.

846
01:10:57,450 --> 01:11:00,870
Look,I'm not the wedding type,right?

847
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:03,590
But for the first time in my life I don't want to be that guy alone at a bar.

848
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:06,360
I want a dance partner, I want a "plus one".

849
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:10,470
And if you can stomach it, I'd like it to be you.

850
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:37,580
Excuse me. Are you available?

851
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:41,760
This line's for members of our Matterhorn Programme.

852
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:49,260
Hey...Ryan.

853
01:11:49,730 --> 01:11:54,090
Hey. - Kara. Hi.

854
01:11:54,730 --> 01:11:56,680
Alex,this is my sister Kara. - Hi.

855
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:59,330
Well,hello.

856
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:03,410
Ryan's told me nothing about you.

857
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:06,670
So you two are dating?

858
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:10,990
Not exactly. - Well,don't worry about it.

859
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:14,050
We're all getting a little old to be calling someone girlfriend.

860
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:17,440
I remember when Mom used to call Jack her boyfriend.

861
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:21,750
Drove me up the wall. Boyfriends are for kids,right?

862
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:24,680
So what are you doing at the hotel?

863
01:12:24,770 --> 01:12:30,240
Yeah,OK,er...Frank and I are trying out a trial separation.

864
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:34,420
I'm sorry. So you're not at the house? - No,there was a room on hold here,

865
01:12:34,510 --> 01:12:37,780
so I thought I'd take it for the weekend.

866
01:12:39,710 --> 01:12:44,190
So the rehearsal dinner? - Yeah,tonight. I'll see you there.

867
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:49,810
Nice digs.

868
01:12:52,130 --> 01:12:54,620
There's a packet.

869
01:12:59,990 --> 01:13:01,730
Hey,look who's here.

870
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:06,990
Oh,my God! Oh,my God! Ryan! - Hey.

871
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:13,920
Oh,you must be Alex. - Yes,I am. Hi. How are you?

872
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:18,170
You are so beautiful. Kara was right.

873
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:23,320
Gosh. You look so grown-up.

874
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,940
I do? You're the one that's getting married.

875
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:28,530
Oh,I know,right?

876
01:13:29,130 --> 01:13:32,430
Oh. You haven't even seen my ring.

877
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,350
Oh,look at that. - Oh,it's lovely.

878
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,800
Jim designed it.

879
01:13:37,010 --> 01:13:39,410
Hey,Jim.

880
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:42,900
Hey. - How's it going?

881
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:45,550
Hey. I'm Ryan. - Jim. Good to meet you.

882
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:48,560
Alex. Pleasure. - Pleasure.

883
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:51,050
Thank you,guys,for coming.

884
01:13:51,370 --> 01:13:53,640
Brother!

885
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:57,930
It's true,though. - Yeah,it's crazy.

886
01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:03,480
I got the pictures you asked me to get. - You can just put them right there.

887
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:07,900
Yeah,OK.

888
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:38,200
You got so many up there, I almost didn't have room.

889
01:14:38,290 --> 01:14:42,260
I know. It's so great,everyone just chipped in.

890
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:45,600
What gave you the idea to do something so...

891
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:48,420
Substantial. - Well...

892
01:14:48,570 --> 01:14:52,560
Jim has a lot of our nest egg invested in this real estate venture.

893
01:14:52,650 --> 01:14:55,510
Mm-hm. It's a real estate investment.

894
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:58,470
It's exciting, but we went over our finances and...

895
01:14:58,550 --> 01:15:02,720
A honeymoon at this state in the game doesn't really seem affordable.

896
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,790
So,you know,we just thought,

897
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:08,520
just because we can't travel doesn't mean we can't have pictures.

898
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:11,160
I think that's a fabulous idea. - Yeah,it's a good one.

899
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:14,360
The concept is turnkey everything.

900
01:15:14,450 --> 01:15:17,700
You buy a maintenance contract when you get the home. We'll whack your weeds,

901
01:15:17,790 --> 01:15:22,540
change your light bulbs. Furniture - you can bring your own or pick one of our packages.

902
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:26,460
Seamless traditionalism,yet all the perks. - Nice.

903
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:32,080
We all need a place to call our own. This is America. This is what we were promised.

904
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:35,810
It's a nice touch. - What?

905
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:38,030
The bit at the end about the promise. I like that part.

906
01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:41,180
Oh,thanks.

907
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:47,680
You er...you still renting that one-bedroom? - No. I gave it up.

908
01:15:47,770 --> 01:15:50,510
So you own now? - No.

909
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,660
But you're looking?

910
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:55,490
No,not really.

911
01:15:55,740 --> 01:15:57,910
So you're just good?

912
01:15:58,250 --> 01:16:01,390
I'm good. - Well,that's good.

913
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:05,350
Can you believe it's tomorrow? How are you gonna sleep?

914
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:07,430
I don't know.

915
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:10,950
Well,do you want some Xanax? - I don't think that's for sleeping.

916
01:16:11,030 --> 01:16:14,620
Yeah. No,I think I'll just have a glass of warm milk.

917
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:18,510
That'll do the trick. - OK. See you tomorrow.

918
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:22,520
There's another box inside.

919
01:16:22,610 --> 01:16:24,180
I'll grab it. - You sure?

920
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:26,970
Yeah,yeah,yeah.

921
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:38,440
Jim seems like a good guy. - Yeah,isn't he great?

922
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:41,530
He's going to make a great husband.

923
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:48,740
You know,Julie,I was thinking, you know,with Dad not being here,erm...

924
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:52,930
I was wondering if you had anybody to walk you down the aisle.

925
01:16:57,850 --> 01:17:02,520
No,Jim's uncle is gonna do it. - He's been really supportive.

926
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,240
He's been great.

927
01:17:04,330 --> 01:17:08,350
Well,good. That's great. I just wanted to make sure that you...

928
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:11,940
I wanted you to be covered,that's all.

929
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,900
So,I should be there,what?

930
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:23,060
The other guests are arriving around five and things get going at five-thirty so...

931
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:26,050
around then. - OK.

932
01:17:27,670 --> 01:17:31,570
Oh. Let me... I'm gonna help you with those.

933
01:17:32,650 --> 01:17:34,850
Got it.

934
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:39,490
It's OK. It's OK,it's OK.

935
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:49,520
None of that was here.

936
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,370
This is all new.

937
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:04,600
Really?

938
01:18:04,950 --> 01:18:08,650
Is that all you got? - What?

939
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:17,570
Give me a boost.

940
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,760
Watch...

941
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:23,430
Hang on.

942
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:32,430
I took Geography in here.

943
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:34,950
You ever fool around with one of your teachers?

944
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:39,520
No. Did you? - No. Not until college.

945
01:18:43,890 --> 01:18:46,680
That's me on the right.

946
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:52,380
It's kinda hard to tell. - You can tell by the eyebrows.

947
01:18:52,590 --> 01:18:56,830
You played basketball? - I was a point guard. Don't act so surprised.

948
01:18:56,910 --> 01:19:00,370
I didn't know you were such a jock.

949
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:02,700
That's me too.

950
01:19:02,790 --> 01:19:05,750
And that.

951
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:09,560
My first fight. - How'd it go?

952
01:19:09,650 --> 01:19:12,100
Got my ass kicked.

953
01:19:12,190 --> 01:19:20,630
This is where we used to go to make out. - Oh,yes. Yeah. This is very romantic.

954
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:37,050
I'm really happy I came here. - So am I.

955
01:19:42,670 --> 01:19:44,950
It's Kara.

956
01:19:45,890 --> 01:19:48,660
Ryan,where are you? We're having a meltdown here.

957
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:49,840
What's going on? What happened?

958
01:19:49,930 --> 01:19:52,200
It's Jim. Can you get back here? We need your help.

959
01:19:52,290 --> 01:19:54,630
OK.

960
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,710
We gotta go.

961
01:20:00,430 --> 01:20:04,010
I'll grab your suit. - Thanks.

962
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:24,850
What happened? - Jim's got cold feet.

963
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:27,590
Today? - Yeah,that's how cold feet work.

964
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:30,720
What do you want me to do? - Talk to him.

965
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:33,700
You want me to talk to him? - Hey,it's either you or me.

966
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:36,270
You know my track record. I've already struck out once.

967
01:20:36,350 --> 01:20:38,860
I haven't been to bat. I haven't been in the dugout.

968
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:41,600
Don't you talk for a living? Motivational-type stuff?

969
01:20:41,690 --> 01:20:44,310
I tell people how to avoid commitment.

970
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:47,620
It's a philosophy. - It's stupid.

971
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:50,850
Hey,it could have helped you. - Ryan.

972
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:56,200
You haven't been around much. Fuck - basically,you don't exist to us.

973
01:20:56,290 --> 01:20:59,120
I know you wanna be there for her.

974
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:03,610
Well,here it is. This is your chance.

975
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:26,880
Hey. What's up,Ryan?

976
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,330
Jim. - You ever read this before?

977
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:36,360
Yeah,it's pretty powerful stuff. - I'll say.

978
01:21:38,710 --> 01:21:44,580
Er...Kara mentioned that you were having some thoughts.

979
01:21:44,730 --> 01:21:49,520
I don't think I'm going to be able to er... to do this.

980
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:53,510
Why would you say that...today?

981
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:57,880
Well,last night I was kinda laying in bed and I couldn't get to sleep.

982
01:21:57,970 --> 01:22:01,290
So I started thinking about the wedding and the ceremony,

983
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:04,770
and about our buying a house and moving in together.

984
01:22:04,850 --> 01:22:08,690
And having a kid, and having another kid and then

985
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:11,350
Christmas and Thanksgiving and spring break.

986
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:14,910
Going to football games,and then all of a sudden they're graduating.

987
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:19,040
They're getting jobs,getting married. And,you know,I'm a grandparent.

988
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:22,440
And then I'm retired. I'm losing my hair,I'm getting fat.

989
01:22:22,530 --> 01:22:25,000
And then the next thing you know I'm dead.

990
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:29,680
I'm just,like...I can't stop from thinking, what's the point?

991
01:22:32,150 --> 01:22:35,200
I mean,what is the point?

992
01:22:35,290 --> 01:22:40,270
The point? - What am I starting here?

993
01:22:41,170 --> 01:22:44,620
Jim,it's...marriage.

994
01:22:44,890 --> 01:22:49,350
It's one of the most beautiful things on earth. It's what people aspire to.

995
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:52,340
You never got married. - That's true.

996
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:56,720
I mean,you never even tried. - Well,it's hard to define try.

997
01:22:56,810 --> 01:23:01,280
I don't know,just you seem happier than all my married friends.

998
01:23:02,870 --> 01:23:06,680
Look,Jim,I'm not going to lie to you. Marriage can be a pain in the ass.

999
01:23:06,770 --> 01:23:11,550
And you're right. This all is just stuff that leads to your eventual demise.

1000
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,690
Yes. - And we're all on running clocks.

1001
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:17,120
And they can't be slowed down or paused.

1002
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:21,560
And...we all end up in the same place. - yeah.

1003
01:23:22,890 --> 01:23:27,710
There is no point. - There is no point. That's what I'm saying.

1004
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:34,700
You know,er...

1005
01:23:35,090 --> 01:23:39,350
I'm not normally the guy you would talk to about stuff like this.

1006
01:23:42,270 --> 01:23:44,930
If you think about it...

1007
01:23:46,110 --> 01:23:50,070
your favourite memories,the most important moments in your life.

1008
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:52,430
Were you alone?

1009
01:23:52,790 --> 01:23:56,640
No,I guess not.

1010
01:23:56,970 --> 01:23:59,010
Come to think of it,

1011
01:23:59,090 --> 01:24:02,300
last night,the night before your wedding when all this shit is swirling around in your head,

1012
01:24:02,390 --> 01:24:04,830
weren't you guys in separate bedrooms?

1013
01:24:04,910 --> 01:24:10,250
Yeah,Julie went back to the apartment and I was just by myself in the honeymoon suite.

1014
01:24:10,330 --> 01:24:14,140
Kinda lonely,huh? - Yes,it was pretty lonely.

1015
01:24:15,210 --> 01:24:18,140
Life's better with company.

1016
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:23,390
Yeah... - Everybody needs a co-pilot.

1017
01:24:24,650 --> 01:24:27,930
That was a nice touch. - Thanks.

1018
01:24:30,010 --> 01:24:34,860
So er... what's the mood like out there? - It's not good.

1019
01:24:34,950 --> 01:24:38,770
She's pretty pissed? - Just upset.

1020
01:24:40,010 --> 01:24:42,700
What should I do?

1021
01:24:44,050 --> 01:24:46,340
Go get her.

1022
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:03,590
I'm such a fuck-up. I love you so much.

1023
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:06,800
Will you be my co-pilot?

1024
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:11,420
Yes. Yes.

1025
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:18,280
Welcome home.

1026
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:56,510
OK,this is your stop.

1027
01:28:02,650 --> 01:28:07,380
When am I gonna see you? - You're just gonna have to come visit.

1028
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:10,280
Oh...so settled.

1029
01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:17,670
You're not gonna change on me,are you? - No. Same guy. Just one address.

1030
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:23,700
This is your final boarding call for Flight 3972 to Chicago.

1031
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:28,360
Right. Call me when you get lonely.

1032
01:28:30,650 --> 01:28:33,070
I'm lonely.

1033
01:29:05,510 --> 01:29:07,560
Some guy sits in a conference room somewhere

1034
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:10,920
and our server routes his session to one of our termination engineers.

1035
01:29:11,010 --> 01:29:12,620
"Termination engineers"? Really?

1036
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:15,350
I preferred "terminators" but it bumped with Legal.

1037
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:16,820
Can't imagine why.

1038
01:29:16,910 --> 01:29:20,840
The workflow takes them through anything from a standard dismissal to a violent aggressor.

1039
01:29:20,930 --> 01:29:23,070
What are they doing now,practising?

1040
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:27,700
Beta testing,role-playing. We go live at the end of the month.

1041
01:29:27,870 --> 01:29:30,180
Kyle,you're running through the events too quickly.

1042
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:34,110
Give them time to acknowledge each statement. It's a legal thing.

1043
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:38,350
Ryan? - Mm? Oh. Yeah. There's more?

1044
01:29:44,670 --> 01:29:45,930
This is ridiculous.

1045
01:29:46,010 --> 01:29:51,200
Legal's starting to come hard at me on this term "terminate"...

1046
01:30:16,950 --> 01:30:20,420
Life to the power of you!

1047
01:30:29,670 --> 01:30:32,810
Ladies and gentlemen. Put your hands together for today's challenge speaker,

1048
01:30:32,890 --> 01:30:35,860
Mr Ryan Bingham

1049
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:38,810
Go get 'em.

1050
01:30:48,690 --> 01:30:53,160
Last year I flew 350,000 miles.

1051
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:55,960
The moon is 250.

1052
01:30:58,460 --> 01:31:02,840
I want you to imagine for a second that you're carrying a backpack.

1053
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:06,060
I want you to feel the straps on your shoulders

1054
01:31:06,670 --> 01:31:08,790
You feel 'em?

1055
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:15,230
Now I want you to pack it with all the stuff that you have in your life.

1056
01:31:15,610 --> 01:31:22,290
Start with the little things - the things on shelves and in drawers.

1057
01:31:40,670 --> 01:31:43,300
Excuse me.

1058
01:31:46,090 --> 01:31:48,180
What the fuck are you doing?

1059
01:31:48,260 --> 01:31:53,220
Relax. We'll have your next guest out in one sec.

1060
01:32:14,940 --> 01:32:17,980
Hey,you gotta sign. - OK.

1061
01:32:18,990 --> 01:32:21,410
OK,thank you.

1062
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:27,920
Hey,you forgot to give me your Hertz No.1 Gold Card!

1063
01:33:02,670 --> 01:33:05,380
So I was in the neighbourhood.

1064
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:24,970
Hey,honey,who's at the door? - Just somebody who's lost.

1065
01:34:22,590 --> 01:34:23,790
Alex?

1066
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:26,810
What were you thinking, showing up at my door like that?

1067
01:34:26,890 --> 01:34:30,750
What do you mean? I wanted to see you. I didn't know you had a family.

1068
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:32,550
Why didn't you tell me that?

1069
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:36,480
Sorry I ruined your evening but you could have screwed things up for me.

1070
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:41,130
That's my family. That's my real life.

1071
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:46,220
I thought I was a part of your real life.

1072
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:49,720
I thought we signed up for the same thing.

1073
01:34:50,850 --> 01:34:55,660
Try and help me understand exactly what it is that you signed up for.

1074
01:34:56,090 --> 01:35:00,720
I thought our relationship was perfectly clear. I mean...

1075
01:35:00,810 --> 01:35:04,180
you are an escape.

1076
01:35:05,460 --> 01:35:08,200
You're a break from our normal lives, you're a...

1077
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:11,340
a parenthesis.

1078
01:35:13,550 --> 01:35:15,270
I'm a parenthesis?

1079
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:19,720
I mean... what do you want?

1080
01:35:20,810 --> 01:35:23,360
Tell me what you want.

1081
01:35:27,460 --> 01:35:30,210
You don't even know what you want.

1082
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:34,700
Ryan,I'm a grown-up,OK?

1083
01:35:34,790 --> 01:35:40,180
So if you would like to see me again, then then give me a call.

1084
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:43,400
OK?

1085
01:35:58,420 --> 01:36:01,410
Ladies and gentlemen,we have a special announcement to make.

1086
01:36:01,490 --> 01:36:05,860
Our pilot has just informed me that we are passing over the city of Dubuque,

1087
01:36:05,950 --> 01:36:11,390
which might not mean much to most of you, but means a lot to one of our flyers today.

1088
01:36:11,470 --> 01:36:17,500
Oh,no. - He just hit 10 million miles!

1089
01:36:20,190 --> 01:36:23,220
Congratulations. - Such an amazing accomplishment.

1090
01:36:23,310 --> 01:36:26,040
You must be very excited.

1091
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:28,540
Hi,Captain. - Captain.

1092
01:36:28,620 --> 01:36:30,940
That seat taken?

1093
01:36:31,030 --> 01:36:33,560
No. No.

1094
01:36:39,570 --> 01:36:42,930
You're the youngest yet to hit 10 mil.

1095
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:46,010
Don't know where you found the time.

1096
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:49,580
Yeah. I don't know.

1097
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,750
Here you go.

1098
01:36:58,230 --> 01:37:01,180
Seventh card we've made.

1099
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:03,890
Small club.

1100
01:37:05,490 --> 01:37:09,300
We really appreciate your loyalty.

1101
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:14,730
You know how many times I thought about this moment?

1102
01:37:16,630 --> 01:37:20,080
Played out the conversation that you and I would have right here.

1103
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:22,340
Really?

1104
01:37:24,390 --> 01:37:27,290
What did you want to say?

1105
01:37:31,490 --> 01:37:34,120
You know,I don't remember.

1106
01:37:35,650 --> 01:37:40,370
That's all right. It happens to all of us.

1107
01:37:43,350 --> 01:37:45,920
So where are you from?

1108
01:37:51,470 --> 01:37:53,940
I'm from here.

1109
01:38:11,650 --> 01:38:13,980
Hello,Mr Bingham.

1110
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:16,170
How did you know it was me?

1111
01:38:16,250 --> 01:38:21,030
This is your dedicated line. We reserve them for our most loyal and appreciated flyers.

1112
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:26,670
I'd like to transfer some of my miles. Can I open up an account to Jim and Julie Miller?

1113
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:29,520
Certainly. How many miles would you like to transfer?

1114
01:38:29,610 --> 01:38:31,900
How many miles does it take to circle the globe?

1115
01:38:31,990 --> 01:38:36,260
We have our round-the-world tickets. They're 500,000 miles each.

1116
01:38:36,350 --> 01:38:37,990
That'd be fine. - Got a second?

1117
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:39,530
I'll call you back.

1118
01:38:39,610 --> 01:38:42,180
What happened to you yesterday? I was trying to get hold of you.

1119
01:38:42,270 --> 01:38:46,100
I was some personal stuff. What's going on?

1120
01:38:46,190 --> 01:38:48,630
Do you remember Karen Barnes,

1121
01:38:49,310 --> 01:38:52,490
part of a 30-person reduction a few weeks back in Wichita?

1122
01:38:52,580 --> 01:38:57,640
Natalie fired her. - Fired dozens of people a day. I...

1123
01:38:57,720 --> 01:39:00,790
She killed herself - jumped off a bridge.

1124
01:39:02,390 --> 01:39:03,820
Fuck.

1125
01:39:03,910 --> 01:39:08,230
I need to know if you remember any woman that gave you any signals,

1126
01:39:08,310 --> 01:39:11,440
depression... - They're all depressed. We're firing them.

1127
01:39:11,530 --> 01:39:16,900
Hey,I need to ask you this stuff,OK? - No,I don't remember anything.

1128
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:20,450
You never think that they're...

1129
01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:22,880
You don't remember any woman that gave you any signals?

1130
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:27,280
Anything at all,Ryan? - No,nothing stands out.

1131
01:39:29,890 --> 01:39:33,840
Is Natalie all right? - Natalie quit.

1132
01:39:36,820 --> 01:39:40,730
She quit? - Text message.

1133
01:39:41,180 --> 01:39:44,850
Fucking nice,right? No-one's got any manners any more.

1134
01:39:44,940 --> 01:39:49,910
Did she say where she was going? - No. She was a little upset.

1135
01:39:51,150 --> 01:39:53,750
I should give her a call.

1136
01:39:56,460 --> 01:39:59,530
I need you back in the air.

1137
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:05,370
Hey. Did you hear what I said? I thought you'd be thrilled about that.

1138
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:08,440
It's fine. What about the videoconferencing?

1139
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:14,640
CTC is going to pause the new media front. They're gonna give it some more thought.

1140
01:40:14,730 --> 01:40:19,270
We are gonna get our workhorses back in the air doing what they do best,OK?

1141
01:40:20,470 --> 01:40:22,760
How long are you sending me out?

1142
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:27,990
We're gonna let you sail and sail. You send us a postcard if you ever get there.

1143
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:44,270
So what happened?

1144
01:40:45,250 --> 01:40:47,520
How exactly do you mean?

1145
01:40:47,610 --> 01:40:49,870
You graduated top of your class.

1146
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:52,640
You seemed to have your pick of employment,including here.

1147
01:40:52,730 --> 01:40:57,500
Instead you went to Omaha to fire people for a living?

1148
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:01,760
It's challenging work. - I'll say!

1149
01:41:01,850 --> 01:41:04,800
I can't imagine doing that, day in,day out.

1150
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:07,180
Not in this climate.

1151
01:41:08,670 --> 01:41:11,470
I followed a boy.

1152
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:18,390
I guess everybody does that at one point or another.

1153
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:26,250
This guy says I'd be lucky to have you.

1154
01:41:26,340 --> 01:41:28,570
To whom it may concern.

1155
01:41:28,660 --> 01:41:31,720
I can't even count the number of people I've fired in my lifetime.

1156
01:41:31,810 --> 01:41:35,420
So many that I've actually forgotten what it's like to hire somebody.

1157
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:40,520
We've never met,but I know you'd be lucky to have Natalie Keener.

1158
01:41:40,610 --> 01:41:43,450
My advice? Take her and don't look back.

1159
01:41:43,530 --> 01:41:47,220
She'll be the best decision you've made in a long time.

1160
01:41:50,830 --> 01:41:53,690
I sure hope he's right.

1161
01:42:04,590 --> 01:42:06,520
Well,I don't have a lot of hope,

1162
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:09,220
and I really don't know when it's gonna get better.

1163
01:42:09,310 --> 01:42:11,950
There's a lot of people unemployed.

1164
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:17,230
And I really don't know when there's gonna be light at the end of the tunnel.

1165
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:18,980
I can't find much to talk about.

1166
01:42:19,070 --> 01:42:21,920
Talk about being proud. I'm proud of my kids.

1167
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:27,130
I think the anger comes from the fact that I just wasn't needed any more.

1168
01:42:27,210 --> 01:42:29,380
I would say,you know,uh...

1169
01:42:29,460 --> 01:42:32,190
without my friends and my family,

1170
01:42:32,270 --> 01:42:34,090
I wouldn't have made it.

1171
01:42:34,170 --> 01:42:36,980
It would have been a lot tougher if I'd had to make it on my own.

1172
01:42:37,070 --> 01:42:41,320
When I wake up in the morning and I look over and I see my wife,

1173
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:44,320
that gives me the sense of purpose.

1174
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:47,290
It's not all about the money. Money can keep you warm.

1175
01:42:47,380 --> 01:42:51,730
It pays your heating bills. It can buy you a blanket.

1176
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:56,950
But it doesn't keep you as warm as when my husband holds me.

1177
01:42:57,040 --> 01:43:01,790
Let me get up. Let me get out. Let me find something.

1178
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:07,120
So my kids are my purpose. My family.

1179
01:43:35,790 --> 01:43:40,980
Tonight most people will be welcomed home by jumping dogs and squealing kids.

1180
01:43:41,450 --> 01:43:45,810
Their spouses will ask about their day and tonight they'll sleep.

1181
01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:51,050
The stars will wheel forth from their daytime hiding places.

1182
01:43:51,860 --> 01:43:55,070
And one of those lights, slightly brighter than the rest,

1183
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:59,290
will be my wing tip passing over.

1184
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:14,340
Hi,Jason. My name is Kevin. And I recently lost my job.

1185
01:46:14,460 --> 01:46:20,360
I wrote this song as sort of a statement about uncertainty

1186
01:46:20,450 --> 01:46:23,820
and having a certain amount of anxiety about the future.

1187
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:27,560
So maybe you can use it in your movie.
