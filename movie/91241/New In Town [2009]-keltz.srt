1
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,609
Oh, I bet you that's Trudy right now.

2
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,861
Harve, would you get that?

3
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,783
Harve, get that, will you?

4
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,869
To the 35, 40. What a block.

5
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,413
Forty-five, still going.
Brought down at the 50.

6
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,833
Okay, buster, no tapioca for you.

7
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,835
-Hey, everybody.
-Hi.

8
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,045
Hi, Trudy.

9
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:31,090
l froze my patootie off waiting
for someone to open that door.

10
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:34,009
You know how those New Ulm men
get when the Vikings play.

11
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:37,930
-Yeah, l know.
-So, Trudy, l've got cocoa, tea or cider.

12
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,139
Cider. Thank you.

13
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,475
So, what's the latest?

14
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,228
You girls are terrible.
You start right in on that gossip.

15
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,896
lt's not gossip, it's news.

16
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,148
Yes, Blanche, it's news.

17
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,650
So spit it out.

18
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,611
The reason l was late
is because l just got off the phone...

19
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:56,240
-...with Munck headquarters in Miami.
-What did they want?

20
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:59,743
To rent a house for the new
plant manager they're sending here.

21
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,578
-No way.
-Yes way.

22
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:04,289
We remember what happened
to that Iast plant manager...

23
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,458
...that Stu and his fellas
ran out of town.

24
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,669
The one that choked
on the knackwurst...

25
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,712
...during the Braunschweiger
competition?

26
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,508
Or what about the manager Stu had
stand too close to the glockenspiel?

27
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,511
-You know I heard he stiIl has tinnitus?
-What's that?

28
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,847
Well, it's like:

29
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,443
All day long for the rest of your life.

30
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,154
Oh, my God, that's horrible.

31
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,197
Don't forget
the Land O' Lakes manager...

32
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:40,033
...that mysteriously got locked into
the dairy cooler.

33
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:43,829
What that man had to do
in that cooIer to survive....

34
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,205
lt's unmentionable.

35
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:50,544
God bless our new plant manager
whoever the poor guy is.

36
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,380
Amen.

37
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,105
Good morning. Munck Foods.

38
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:58,946
Sorry I'm late.

39
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:02,032
-We haven't gotten far.
-We had to wait for you.

40
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,453
We were discussing
how getting the New Ulm facility...

41
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:10,040
...dumped on our division
is going to affect our bottom line.

42
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,709
Well, wouldn't it just be better
to close the plant?

43
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,586
lt looks like a lost cause to me.

44
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:18,715
Yes, but Marketing wants to cross
our branding in the youth demo...

45
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:23,470
...with the adult protein craze with
Rocket Bars, protein snacks for kids.

46
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,472
Now, we can use
the existing facility...

47
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,350
...but we'll have to automate it
to produce the new Iine...

48
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:32,229
...downsize production,
reduce the workforce by 50 percent.

49
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,815
The question is, who will oversee it?

50
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,988
Don't alI of you volunteer at once.

51
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,287
l can do it.

52
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:52,165
And, hey, Lucy's single.
She could do the conversion on-site.

53
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,918
-That's not in the proposal.
-On-site would expedite it.

54
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,420
You'll go immediately.

55
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:59,506
Joan, book Lucy to Minnesota
this weekend.

56
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,009
This--? Minnesota?

57
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,468
Knew l could count on you.

58
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,715
-Can l give you a hand with that?
-Oh, l've got it. Thank you.

59
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,175
All right.

60
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,262
How bad can it be?

61
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,317
Holy mother--

62
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,654
Traveling on Flight 1 1 6
to New Orleans.

63
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,281
Flight 1 1 6.

64
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,950
l'm spending winter in a theme park.

65
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,345
Okay.

66
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:59,853
Oh, my Lord,
locked the door at 5 out of habit.

67
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:04,149
Can we help you?

68
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,068
Yeah, l'm looking
for Blanche Gunderson.

69
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,070
My assistant, Cathy, called.

70
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,572
You must be Miss Hill.

71
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,449
l'm Blanche Gunderson.

72
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,619
You're my executive assistant?

73
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:16,870
Oh, heavens, no.

74
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,079
l'm just a secretary.

75
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,123
Did you need me to find you
one of those?

76
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:21,958
We'll see.

77
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,044
What you need to find
is a place to live.

78
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,714
Right. So this is your realtor, Trudy.

79
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,424
Trudy Van Uuden at your service.

80
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,968
That's with two U's.
A double U, not a W.

81
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,889
l'll drive. What do you say
you folIow with Ms. Hill?

82
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,557
Oh, good idea.

83
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,393
Oh, your luggage all matches.

84
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,479
That's so nice.

85
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,193
Say cheese.

86
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,573
Are you a scrapper?

87
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:54,824
Excuse me?

88
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,409
Oh, there's Merle. Hey, Merle.

89
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,913
That's our mailman, Merle.

90
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,957
That's what we call him.
MaiIman Merle.

91
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:05,627
Because he delivers the mail,
and he's our maiIman.

92
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,630
So, you know?

93
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,925
Oh, yeah,
do you keep a scrapbook?

94
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,593
Because l do.

95
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:14,928
l'm a scrapper, see.

96
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,013
We even got a club.

97
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,266
l got a mini in my bag here.

98
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:24,604
Okay, so this here is our dog,
Winston ChurchiIl.

99
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:27,232
He's dead.
He was a bit of drooler, l'm afraid.

100
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,485
And this here is my kitty, Snowflake.

101
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,945
She's dead too.

102
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,865
We had to put her down
on account of that kitty-leukemia thing.

103
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:39,869
You shouId've seen the kinds of things
she was barfing up on our couch.

104
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,871
Poor thing. Bless her heart.

105
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,584
She's not dead in the picture though.
She's just sleeping.

106
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:50,005
Could l look at that later maybe?

107
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,506
Okay?

108
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,800
So....

109
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,305
Are you married?
Do you have children?

110
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,056
No, no. l'm not married.

111
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,517
Oh, you're still young, you know?

112
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,768
Relatively.

113
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:09,149
l mean, you still got time, I suppose.

114
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,486
Do you eat meat, or are you one
of those vegetarian people?

115
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,323
No. l'm not a vegetarian.

116
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,659
-Why?
-Because it's your first night in town.

117
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:22,287
Don't think we're gonna Iet you
go hungry.

118
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,832
You're coming to my house for dinner.
Nothing fancy, of course.

119
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,001
MeatIoaf.

120
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,008
Do you mind
if I ask you a personal question?

121
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:40,055
lsn't that what you've been doing?

122
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,350
Have you found Jesus?

123
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,522
Well, I didn't know he was missing.

124
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,119
lt was just a joke.

125
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,374
Normally we don't joke
about Jesus around here.

126
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:13,463
But l can see how you'd think
that was sort of funny.

127
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,383
lmagine Jesus gone missing.

128
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,052
lmagine.

129
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,240
lt's clearing. ChilI coming on.

130
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,409
lt's gonna get a heck of a lot colder.

131
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:45,370
This place is big, but what the hey.

132
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,581
Colder?

133
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,919
lt gets colder?

134
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,087
Oh, yeah.

135
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,759
Oh, good. Electric is still on.

136
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,053
Heat's LP. Tank's out back.
Furnace is a Norge.

137
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,389
The pipes are wrapped.
Windows are two-paned.

138
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,725
And there's a double layer
of Owens Corning.

139
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,311
Hardwood. You got rugs to keep from
freezing the bejesus out of your toes.

140
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,188
Wait, you just lost me.

141
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,857
No problem. What didn't you get?

142
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,776
Well, I understood
that the electric is still on.

143
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,451
-Does that work?
-Oh, sure as shooting.

144
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,453
Okay. Then I'll take it.

145
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,163
Want me to go over the firepIace?

146
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,791
No, l'm a city girl,
but l know how to light a fire.

147
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,752
Where's the switch?

148
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,304
She seems nice enough.

149
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,474
l doubt she'll last a week.
Poor thing.

150
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,320
There you are.
l was starting to wonder.

151
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:01,988
l got lost.

152
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,491
You said it was around
the other side of the lake.

153
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,659
Every direction l went,
there was a lake.

154
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,995
That's not even a lake.
That's Luden Pond.

155
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,955
l turned around.
l found another lake.

156
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,125
Oh, I bet you went
to Van Meyer Slough.

157
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,836
-And then l went left.
-That's actually a stone quarry.

158
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,922
But you made it.

159
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,757
Yeah.

160
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:27,013
Oh, Harve, company.

161
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:30,016
l didn't know whether
to get red or white.

162
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,521
But all they had
was Zinfandel anyway, so....

163
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:39,818
Oh, hell, anything you can uncork,
uncap or unscrew, l'll drink it.

164
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:44,823
This is my husband, Harve.
You'd think he's joking, but he's not.

165
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,492
-Take your coat?
-Yes. Please.

166
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,369
That would be great.

167
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,038
Thank you.

168
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,712
You okay like that?
You're not too cold?

169
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,964
No. l'm fine.

170
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,759
Oh, okay,
because you look a little cold.

171
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,845
l'm fine.

172
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,273
Anyhow, there's someone
that l want you to meet.

173
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,899
l'm hoping that you hit it off.

174
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:24,821
lf you do, it's gonna make your stay
here in Minnesota a lot more pleasant.

175
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:30,201
So, Lucy Hill, this is Ted Mitchell.

176
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,706
Damn.

177
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,917
-Oh, so it's a whole dinner party.
-Oh, yeah.

178
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,335
Lovely. Thank you.

179
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,170
How you doing?

180
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:45,091
You've got beer dripping
from your chin.

181
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,011
-Awesome.
-Can l use your powder room?

182
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:51,264
You betcha. lt's right through
the kitchen to the right.

183
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,621
-Yeah?
-Lucy, we thought we'd open...

184
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:17,081
...that wine with dinner.
Would you Iike a glass?

185
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,458
Yeah, that would be great.

186
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,669
You know,
l actually am feeling a little chiIly.

187
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,463
Would you mind
bringing my jacket?

188
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,256
Oh, you betcha.

189
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,217
God.

190
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:38,645
-Blanche, this meatloaf is good.
-Oh, thank you, Ted.

191
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,449
So, Ted, do you live around here?

192
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,453
Yeah.

193
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,330
Yeah, l moved up here.

194
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,831
Little over 1 0 years ago.

195
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,583
Why?

196
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,420
l mean, not that it's not nice.
l'm sure.

197
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,838
But why?

198
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,676
Why not, you know?

199
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,013
What's so great about a city?

200
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:19,060
Well, I mean,
the cultural advantages alone.

201
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:23,523
Museums, opera, ballet, theater.
Not to mention nightlife.

202
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,483
Oh, yeah.

203
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,861
Do you know l was in a restaurant,
and Justin Timberlake walked in?

204
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,532
-For real?
-Is he one of your MP3 feIlas?

205
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,159
Oh, that's nice.

206
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,537
l thought all they had
was skinny supermodels...

207
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,038
...and Colombian drug lords.

208
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,291
Ted, that's terrible.

209
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,712
You know who eIse was there,
Bobbie?

210
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,714
Fergie.

211
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,507
l bet you like her music, huh?

212
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,884
My dad won't let me like that stuff.

213
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,805
Well, you seem old enough
to decide for yourself what you like.

214
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,640
Excuse me?

215
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:01,686
Women like that just selling
themselves as sex objects?

216
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,148
What kind of a roIe modeI is that
for young girls?

217
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:10,486
l think that any examples of strong
successful young women are vital.

218
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:14,741
And that's how you measure success?
By how provocative a woman can be?

219
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,909
We'll pass on that.
We'll listen to country.

220
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,746
Oh, the twangy drivel
about the losers who drink beer...

221
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,748
...and drive pickup trucks?

222
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,416
Yeah.

223
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,920
How about polka?
lt's got something for everybody.

224
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,339
That's it, Harve,
you're exactIy right. Bingo.

225
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,176
l like beer.

226
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,429
l drive a pickup.

227
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,683
l should have known.

228
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,276
You probably drive a new car
for what it says about you...

229
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,944
...when what it says about you...

230
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:55,531
...is how you bow down to the big
corporations that made a gravy train.

231
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,117
And would anybody Iike
more gravy?

232
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,327
Trudy? KimberIey?

233
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:03,122
lndustrial competition in a free-market
economy is what built this country.

234
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,959
No, robber barons built it, and they
did it from the bIood of working folks.

235
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,629
lf you steaI somebody's car,
you get thrown in jail.

236
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,256
lf you steaI life savings,
you get to be a CEO.

237
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,966
l'm pIanning on being a CEO.

238
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,803
You better count the silverware
before she leaves.

239
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,097
-I'm leaving now.
-Not if I leave first.

240
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,891
-Come on, baby.
-I've got Snickerdoodles with tapioca.

241
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,935
-Thanks for dinner.
-Thanks for dinner.

242
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,149
Totally awesome.

243
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,075
Miss Hill.

244
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:06,245
Stu Kopenhafer, plant foreman.

245
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,080
l'm supposed to show you around.

246
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,759
Milk processors, cooking facilities.

247
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,428
Curdling vats, slop sinks...

248
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,389
...auxiliary refrigeration,
more slop sinks.

249
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,266
Storage racks over there.

250
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:31,604
Conveyor belt.
This is your main production floor.

251
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,107
l'd really like to speak
with the workers.

252
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,443
Where can l do that?

253
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,407
Bob.

254
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,125
What are you waiting for?

255
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,296
Greetings, New Ulm.

256
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:01,425
l'm here to usher in a new phase.

257
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,219
This is a great opportunity.

258
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:07,473
l'm here to reconfigure
for the initialization of Rocket Bars.

259
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,651
This will be an exciting utilization
of new branding...

260
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:22,154
...for capitalizing
on a highly profitable demographic.

261
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,406
Cut to the chase.

262
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:27,076
We don't give a fart on a muggy day
what you're making us make.

263
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,453
Tell us how many you're planning
on laying off.

264
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,290
Management at Munck Foods
in Miami has sent me here...

265
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:35,084
...to conduct mechanization
and modernization procedures.

266
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,962
Yeah, you Munck-ees all say
that crap.

267
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,840
But every time one of you comes,
we end up losing jobs.

268
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,134
Well, I'm interested
in the jobs we'll create.

269
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,846
lf you're not, that's fine, but l'll expect
you to implement the changes...

270
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,848
...in a timely manner.

271
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,349
Okay?

272
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,853
Oh, yeah, well, nice try, Trudy.

273
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,105
No, you're not getting
that recipe out of me.

274
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,315
Because l--

275
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,358
All right, listen, gotta go.
Okay, yeah.

276
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,693
Let me jump.

277
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,945
Yeah, okay, I know.
l'll give it to you Iater.

278
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,364
Okay, bye-bye then. Yeah, bye.

279
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,116
Oh, good morning.
Sorry about that.

280
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:11,120
That was Trudy. She's always trying
to get my tapioca recipe out of me.

281
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:15,333
Yeah, well, l doubt that your tapioca
recipe is gonna affect the plant.

282
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,376
So let's just stick to work
if we could.

283
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,712
Oh, okay.
Oh, Iisten, sorry about being late.

284
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,547
Billy had a run-in up at the schooI.

285
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,175
Had to go talk to the principal,
don't you know?

286
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,970
He thinks he's a little Puff Diddly,
in case you didn't notice last night.

287
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:32,058
-Is that my office?
-Oh, yeah.

288
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,060
l'd like to see you in there, please.

289
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:39,190
As a female, do you know
how l'm on the fast track to VP...

290
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,567
-...in a Fortune 500 company?
-No, l don't.

291
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:45,696
When it's time to work,
l concentrate on work.

292
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,908
-I get you.
-And l expect one's personaI life...

293
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,409
...to be kept personal.

294
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:53,037
-Okay, that's easy.
-But not you, apparently.

295
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,664
You're trying to set me up
after having just met me.

296
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:00,252
-Well, actuaIly--
-I don't want excuses.

297
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,629
l am here to do a job.

298
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,590
l wilI not get personally attached
to this town or anybody.

299
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,093
-Okay, but listen--
-No buts.

300
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:10,721
But for the sake of argument,
let's say l did want to get set up.

301
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:14,892
Trying to hook me up with that guy?
l may be in the middle of nowhere.

302
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,771
But l am not so desperate that l would
consider your sorry-ass truck guy.

303
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,564
-Right. Sorry-ass truck guy.
-Good.

304
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:25,069
Now that that's clear,
let's just brush that off.

305
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:29,949
So l can spend the rest of the morning
kissing the ass of the local union rep.

306
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,535
Who l actually think is here.

307
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,964
Why is he out there?

308
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,217
Funny story.

309
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,596
lt might have been presumptuous
of me to try to set you up...

310
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,974
...but l thought it might help
professionally...

311
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,976
...if you were to meet
the union rep...

312
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,562
...for all of southeastern Minnesota
casually...

313
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,772
...over a nice home-cooked dinner.

314
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:05,109
Ted is the local union rep?

315
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,445
That's right.

316
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,114
The guy that I yelIed at
over your meatIoaf?

317
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,074
And in the driveway some too.

318
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,335
Mr. Mitchell.

319
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,296
Ted, wasn't it?

320
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:29,008
Yeah. But some peopIe refer to me
as "sorry-ass truck guy."

321
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,302
l beg your pardon?

322
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:35,222
Union's been pushing
for better soundproofing in this plant.

323
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,601
But l think they shouId probably
extend it to the office walIs too.

324
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:39,810
Shall we?

325
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:47,026
Well, going over union reguIations
for two hours is not helping.

326
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:50,946
What l'm trying to do is make sure that
during this simple reconfiguration...

327
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:54,241
...as you call it,
that not one union job gets cut.

328
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:56,160
l'm sure we can come
to an agreement.

329
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:59,872
l'm gonna make sure that you comply
with that agreement every step.

330
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,040
Goodbye.

331
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,708
How is the first day going?

332
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,460
lt's been a very productive day.

333
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,962
l've spoken to the employees
and the pIant foreman.

334
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,840
And they are very engaged
in the process.

335
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,259
l've Iaid out my work strategy
with my assistant.

336
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:15,262
And I've begun dialoguing
with the locaI union rep.

337
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,557
l'm sure I'lI be able to forge
a working relationship there.

338
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,268
All right, but if we're gonna downsize
by 50 percent...

339
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,979
...l need you to prioritize
your termination list.

340
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,857
Hi there. l wanted to let you know
l've rearranged my desk.

341
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,401
lt looks so nice
and professionaI now.

342
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:32,696
So if you need anything, a drink,
or a snack, or you get homesick...

343
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,865
...you wanna taIk,
you just give me a shout.

344
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:40,913
l'm so sorry.

345
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:47,878
Oh, I'm already on that.

346
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:10,776
All l'm asking
is that we move these machines...

347
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:13,612
...to make room
for the new production equipment.

348
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,780
Yeah, no.

349
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:18,117
-That's not the way we do things.
-Nope, not the way we do things.

350
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,618
Not the way at all.

351
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:22,288
You're going to have to make
some concessions.

352
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,748
Oh, we're making
some damn concessions.

353
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,584
Like Gopher Day.

354
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,419
-Gopher Day?
-Yeah.

355
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,130
Local holiday.
First Friday of November.

356
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:34,425
We've always gotten it off before,
but we're all working this one.

357
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:35,634
Okay.

358
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,886
lf l close the plant
for Gopher Day at noon...

359
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:40,681
...then come Monday,
you'll start shifting equipment?

360
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,725
-Sure. You betcha.
-Yeah, okay.

361
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,101
Great.

362
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:00,826
Happy Gopher Day.

363
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:27,936
ls there a probIem here?

364
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:30,689
You're damn right
there's a problem.

365
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:33,192
You know, Land O' Lakes
was doing just fine...

366
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,028
...before you greedy Munck-ees
captured it...

367
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:39,031
...and started killing off
my Ioyal hardworking customers.

368
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,702
Listen, Flo.

369
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,621
l'm here to do a job.

370
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:51,043
Just like l'd like you to do your job now
by taking my order, okay?

371
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:54,171
Great.

372
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:58,884
Now that that's clear,
what's the special today?

373
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:04,181
We got a Go-Back-to-Miami
Where-You-Belong speciaI.

374
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,727
Oh, and Happy Gopher Day.

375
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:15,859
How lame-ass do you have to be
to fall for something as butt-stupid...

376
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,904
...as thinking there's a Gopher Day?

377
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,400
Oh, shingles.

378
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,861
Who invited the boss lady?

379
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,865
What do you want?

380
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,451
l thought l might buy you a beer.

381
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,121
lt's a free country.

382
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,957
A proactive approach
to streamline production...

383
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,084
...creates a win-win situation.

384
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:18,922
Of course, it requires strategization
and advanced speciaIization.

385
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,299
Yeah.

386
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,886
This is really great, guys.

387
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:26,096
l'm gIad we're finally dialoguing.

388
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,389
D-word, double shot.

389
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:35,397
Are you guys really interested
in discussing mechanization?

390
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,648
Hell, yeah.

391
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:42,905
l'm really sorry, guys.

392
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:46,158
l meant for that to be a D-word,
so you can all do a double shot.

393
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,076
Way to ruin it, Maurice.

394
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:54,541
You know, l'm in charge of this plant
whether you like it or not.

395
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:58,003
l thought this wouId be an opportunity
for us to bury the hatchet...

396
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:02,174
...but, instead, you just turn me
into some dumb drinking game?

397
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:05,010
Thanks a lot, asshole.

398
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,856
Oh, hi there.

399
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,818
lt's official.
The lakes froze enough to drive on.

400
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,737
So Stu declared it a holiday.

401
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,157
He did, did he?

402
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,828
And where can l find Stu?

403
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,752
Now, who invited boss Iady
this time?

404
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,589
You miserable son of a bitch.

405
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:26,174
lce Day?
What, Gopher Day wasn't enough?

406
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:30,470
Well, you've underestimated who
you're messing with, Stu Kopenhafer.

407
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,431
You're fired.

408
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,395
Crap.

409
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:44,026
You can't fire Stu.

410
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:46,278
l can, and l did.

411
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,446
lce Day?

412
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,615
Just how stupid
does everyone think l am?

413
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,700
What? On a scaIe of one to 1 0?

414
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,828
The first day of ice fishing
is a state holiday.

415
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,288
Fine.

416
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,123
l fired him for insubordination.

417
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,958
Hang on a second.

418
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,085
Stu....

419
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,589
He takes a little whiIe to warm up
to folks, but he's a really good man.

420
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,382
Good?

421
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,469
Clearly, we define that differentIy.

422
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:13,722
But l'm just trying to help you
out here, okay?

423
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,766
Firing the foreman
before Thanksgiving...

424
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,643
...that's not gonna win you friends.

425
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,270
Well, I'm here to do a job,
not make friends.

426
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,230
Stu's fired.

427
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,107
Good night.

428
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:36,662
You expect me to believe
that every machine in the line...

429
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:39,915
...just broke down at the same time?

430
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,432
And Thanksgiving
is gonna be a white one.

431
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,226
We're expecting
another snowstorm...

432
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,353
...blowing in
sometime tomorrow afternoon.

433
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:06,149
lt doesn't matter. l'm going to Miami.

434
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,357
That's right.

435
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,973
Come on.

436
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,768
Oh, come on.

437
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,607
Oh, this is not good.

438
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,503
Hey.

439
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:45,642
l'm in-- l'm in here.

440
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:52,107
Help.

441
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,944
Help. l'm in here.

442
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,714
Thanks a lot, God.

443
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,132
Come on.

444
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,884
-Okay.
-I got you.

445
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,052
Okay. Hey--

446
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,848
Watch the hands,
Mr. Touchy-Feely-Hands.

447
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,641
Don't flatter yourself.

448
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,894
l'm trying to get you out of the car.
Come on.

449
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:33,064
For your information,
l do not need a man to rescue me.

450
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,317
-All right.
-Okay.

451
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,915
Come on.

452
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,419
Let's get you home.

453
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:21,279
You know, you're not so bad
when you're unconscious.

454
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,599
-Come on.
-Oh, yup.

455
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,853
l got it, l got it.

456
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:56,147
-I got it.
-You okay?

457
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,446
l got it. l got it.

458
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,908
l don't need to be carried
through my door...

459
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:10,745
...by some sexy fireman man.

460
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,914
You already gave me
that lecture.

461
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,291
You think l'm sexy, huh?

462
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,334
What? Why would you think that?

463
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,336
Because you just said it.

464
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:20,338
Out Ioud?

465
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:25,927
Here, let me help you.

466
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,137
-I got it.
-HoId on.

467
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,681
-I got it.
-Let me help you, Iet me help you.

468
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,853
Don't get any ideas.

469
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,354
l'm not.

470
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:37,772
You okay?

471
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,858
l'm fine.

472
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,527
Fine.

473
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:53,038
-You okay?
-Yeah.

474
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,998
l'm fine.

475
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:04,442
This will be a good chance for you
to get out and about a little more.

476
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,694
Hi, girls.

477
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,197
We've sold all your tapioca.

478
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:10,865
Oh, good.

479
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,955
How about that rescue?

480
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,998
No wonder
she's looking twitterpated.

481
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,459
Oh, getting saved
by a cutie patootie like that...

482
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:24,629
...no one could blame you
for getting a little crush, you know?

483
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,005
Crush?

484
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:27,340
Ted?

485
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,550
l don't think so.

486
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:31,636
Speaking of your rescue,
we made this.

487
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,304
You keep that in your trunk.

488
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:35,306
lt's got our names and numbers
sewn in...

489
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,559
...so next time
you have emergency contacts.

490
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:41,354
Oh, that's-- That's beautiful.

491
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,773
-You didn't have to do that.
-Oh, we know.

492
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:46,776
But we did it anyways,
and that's what matters the most.

493
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,903
Just the thought of you
out in that storm.

494
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:51,156
You must have been scared
out of your mind.

495
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,616
Oh, I'm sure l was never
in any real danger.

496
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,285
You kidding?

497
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,288
Folks around these parts
freeze to death all the time.

498
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,998
Especially the stupid ones.

499
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:03,501
lt's nature's way
of thinning out the herd, if you ask me.

500
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,921
And that Ted,
he's a handsome deviI.

501
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:10,091
Now he's bending over
to lift that hose.

502
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:12,010
Oh, wiIl you just lookie there?

503
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:21,227
You guys cannot handle that.

504
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,396
l don't know about that.

505
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,440
-Hey.
-Hi.

506
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:28,026
Hey, so the other night.

507
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,195
l was a littIe drunk.

508
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:32,197
l might have said some things.

509
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:33,990
Hey, you were great out there, huh?

510
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,450
Here, kid, come here.

511
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,994
l am so proud of you.

512
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,831
You remember Lucy Hill?
This is Bobbie.

513
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,583
Hi.

514
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,043
What's up?

515
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:48,671
Crosscheck by the goalie. Nice.

516
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,225
lt's great.

517
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,482
Blanche.

518
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:11,236
Thank you for cashing in my ticket.

519
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:13,196
Oh, no troubIe at aIl. Oh, and listen.

520
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,156
Your car's all fixed up good as new.

521
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,492
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

522
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,619
A little something for you.

523
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,871
Oh, it's money.

524
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,918
lt's a hoIiday bonus.

525
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,253
Don't you usually get one?

526
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,673
Normally, we exchange gifts.

527
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,174
But this is nice too.

528
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:36,052
Oh, and listen.

529
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,596
Here's a little Merry Christmas
for you.

530
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,599
Oh, Blanche, you didn't have
to get me anything.

531
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:45,103
Oh, I didn't get it,
not like store-bought get it.

532
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,980
l made it.

533
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,273
Here, open it.

534
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:55,613
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

535
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:03,454
Just in case
you wanted to start scrapping.

536
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,841
"To Lucy. From BIanche."

537
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:23,141
That was your first day here,
remember?

538
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:32,900
When did you take that?

539
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:35,278
Oh, that was a while ago.

540
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,573
You Iooked Iike you had the weight
of the world on your shouIders.

541
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,617
So aIone.

542
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:44,621
But, you know, Lucy,
you're never reaIly alone.

543
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:47,540
Jesus understands
what you're going through.

544
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,834
He's there for you.

545
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,670
So am I.

546
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:02,388
Hey, don't go getting all misty
on me.

547
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:03,848
Here. l got something else.

548
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,559
This ought to cheer you right up.

549
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,646
Some tapioca.

550
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,940
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas, Blanche.

551
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,859
Can l have a hug?

552
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:25,912
Coming.

553
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:17,088
Thanks.

554
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,930
Ted is here for your meeting.

555
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:13,269
-Hi.
-Hi.

556
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:15,813
Thanks.

557
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:21,360
Well, isn't this a nice way
to start out the New Year?

558
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:24,322
"AuId Lang Syne,"
resolutions and all that.

559
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:29,494
lf l can get you two anything,
you two just say the word.

560
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:38,628
l got the comp analysis here.

561
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,588
Okay.

562
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,761
Before we get started.

563
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:49,013
l never had the chance
to clear the air...

564
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:52,975
...after you saved me
from the snow bank.

565
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:58,773
l said a lot of rude things,
and l handled it badly.

566
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:03,444
l think you handled it fine.
You didn't try to get out of your car.

567
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:05,571
And that's good,
because a lot of people...

568
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:09,283
...they try to walk for help,
and they end up dying that way.

569
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:11,494
You were just trying to keep warm.

570
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:15,206
Although, technically,
alcohol isn't recommended.

571
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:18,918
And the red flag, that was....

572
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:21,212
That was brilliant.

573
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:26,133
Now, I don't remember
anything rude.

574
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:30,221
Well, I don't remember
saying thank you.

575
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:32,640
And that's hardly sufficient.

576
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:33,850
So thank you.

577
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:36,936
You're welcome.

578
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,522
So comp analysis.

579
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,066
Yes, comp analysis.

580
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:45,194
Okay, should we start
with the executive group?

581
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,709
-Lucy.
-Returning your bowl.

582
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,752
Oh, what a nice surprise.
Come on in.

583
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,963
Lucy's here.

584
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:07,592
Just so you know,
l transferred it to another container.

585
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:09,594
lt's not like I ate it in one sitting.

586
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:11,762
-We never do.
-Oh, stop.

587
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:14,265
Sit down. Listen, it's not fattening.

588
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:17,059
Ever since Harve's
been on his crazy Atkins kick...

589
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,770
...l had to come up
with a couple of new recipes.

590
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:21,981
Don't even look at me,
Trudy Van Uuden.

591
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,275
You're not getting my secret
out of me.

592
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:29,238
But l will telI you, my tapioca's
mainly low-fat miIk and whey protein.

593
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,407
-No way.
-Yes, whey.

594
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:34,076
Just in time.
We're exchanging Valentine's cards.

595
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,828
We've got yours.

596
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:39,624
Oh, you know, I was just gonna forget
that whole thing this year.

597
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:42,376
You know,
greeting-card-company holiday.

598
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:44,170
Here's for you.

599
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:48,799
Harve? Would you get that?

600
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:51,427
Maybe that's cupid
looking for you right now.

601
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,055
lt's just Ted.

602
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:59,977
l got-- I got a big problem.

603
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:02,980
l need-- l need a woman's help
on this one.

604
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,484
lt's out-- Just out here.

605
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:08,819
FemaIe trouble?

606
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:10,029
Sort of.

607
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:13,532
lt's the Valentine's Dance,
you know?

608
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,661
l-- I just didn't think
it was gonna be that big of a deal.

609
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:19,664
Oh, honey, it's her first date.
Big deal doesn't even start.

610
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:22,333
lt's not like I didn't try.

611
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,505
-I bought her a nice dress.
-Nice?

612
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:33,010
-Pilgrims wore sexier outfits.
-She's 1 3, okay?

613
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:37,181
-Sexy isn't on the menu.
-Okay, is this about the dress?

614
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:40,810
No, it's a little bit worse.

615
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:42,687
Worse than that outfit?

616
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,106
Bobbie, did you want to come out?

617
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:47,525
No, l can't be seen in public.

618
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:50,945
-Ever.
-It's probably not as bad as you think.

619
00:49:56,535 --> 00:50:00,454
l took her to the beauty parlor.
They gave her a perm.

620
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:02,873
Maybe a couple of bows?

621
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,709
Scarves are in these days.

622
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,961
-Oh, yeah, good idea, Trudy.
-Ted, l can help.

623
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,547
But Bobbie will have to come with me.
ls that okay?

624
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,800
-Yeah.
-Bobbie, trust me.

625
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:15,052
Get in the car.

626
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:18,014
And put your little hat back on.

627
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:40,453
Ladies, can we talk shoes?

628
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:45,249
They're heels.

629
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:48,377
Little ones. That's okay, right?

630
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:51,213
My first heels.

631
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:54,216
But they ain't
gonna wear themselves.

632
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,680
They're perfect.

633
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:03,267
She Iike Cinderella and shit.

634
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:11,859
May l present
Miss Roberta Mitchell.

635
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:25,289
Bobbie, you-- You look just like....

636
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:29,627
You're so beautiful.

637
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:40,805
Good evening, Mr. MitcheIl.

638
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:42,890
Hi, Waylon.

639
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:45,476
Wow, Bobs, you look hot.

640
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,436
-The hell she does.
-Here.

641
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:50,022
That's my little girl.
There's nothing hot about her.

642
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,982
Gee, thanks, Dad.

643
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:57,196
You know, l was 1 4 once too.

644
00:51:57,364 --> 00:52:01,659
So l know all about what's going
through your head right now.

645
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:04,495
And your pants.

646
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:06,288
Daddy.

647
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,124
Come on, your mom's waiting.

648
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,417
-Okay.
-Hey, hey, hey.

649
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,087
You're gonna have her home
by 1 0:30, right?

650
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:15,339
-Yeah.
-Okay, hey, hey, Iisten.

651
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:18,134
l want you to remember something.

652
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:24,014
Whatever you do to my daughter,
l do to you.

653
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:31,856
l think what your father meant to say
is go and have a good time.

654
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:34,775
That's not what I meant, actually.

655
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,318
That's not what I said.

656
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:40,364
That is so not what l meant at aIl.

657
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:42,950
Are you okay?

658
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:46,328
Oh, I'm fine.

659
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:49,039
l'm fine. l'm just....

660
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:51,959
l'm oId.

661
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:55,504
My daughter is starting to date,
you know? How did that happen?

662
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:56,881
l don't feel so good.

663
00:52:57,048 --> 00:53:00,176
l'm gonna just sit down for a minute.
l can't feel my feet.

664
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:02,636
Yeah.

665
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,681
l think l'm having a stroke.

666
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:10,519
You know what?
l might be having a heart attack too.

667
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:12,563
Because my hands, they're numb.

668
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:15,900
ls it your left hand or your right hand
with a heart attack?

669
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:18,360
l can't remember which hand it is.

670
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,783
So how did you know
l wasn't having a heart attack?

671
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:29,496
Because l've seen this thing before.
My father was very overprotective.

672
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:33,167
So l guess this isn't how you planned
on spending your Saturday.

673
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:38,255
You know, nothing about Minnesota
has falIen into what l pIanned.

674
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:40,090
l hear you.

675
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:46,513
You know,
l used to go to the factory a lot.

676
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:49,934
Outside of Miami, with my dad.

677
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:52,770
He knew everything about it,
inside and out.

678
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:54,939
Even the guys in the suits
would ask him...

679
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:56,732
...how to get things done,
you know?

680
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,778
l thought he was the boss.

681
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,615
l was really surprised.

682
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,413
He did maintenance at the plant.

683
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:15,459
You know, he really drilled that
into my head. That--

684
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:17,002
You know, get an education...

685
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:20,339
...and it's the only thing
that peopIe can't take away from you.

686
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,633
Work hard
and do what needs to be done...

687
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:28,973
...and maybe one day
you'll be the boss of a place like this.

688
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:31,934
lronic, isn't it?

689
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,772
And how about you?

690
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:40,484
How did you end up in New Ulm?

691
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,280
The Mayo Clinic.

692
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:52,997
-The Mayo Clinic?
-It's just a few miles from here.

693
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:59,086
l was born in North Carolina,
and l went to school in Auburn.

694
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:01,714
l met my wife, Brenda, there.

695
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:06,260
lt's funny, I say my wife.

696
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:09,680
And even though it's been,
what, six years...

697
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:12,641
...l still feel like she just ran out...

698
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:15,269
...to the store to get something,
you know?

699
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:27,531
She was diagnosed
with a degenerative heart defect.

700
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:34,204
And they had this program at the clinic
and that became our life really.

701
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:36,540
Trips to the clinic.

702
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:41,295
When the phone rang,
l'd just hold my breath.

703
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:50,888
Did you ever think about
moving back South?

704
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:56,060
This was really the only home
that Bobbie ever knew...

705
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:58,812
...and she'd just lost her mama.

706
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,065
And it didn't seem fair for her...

707
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:04,318
...to lose her home and her friends
and her school and all that.

708
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:05,903
So....

709
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:50,781
-What time is it?
-I don't know.

710
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:15,514
Well, you're finally home. Because
all l've done is sit here and worry.

711
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,641
lt's not even 1 0:30.

712
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:19,309
Lucy, you're stilI here?

713
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:24,731
Well, I had to make sure he didn't get
the shotgun out if you were late.

714
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:31,155
And now that l've seen to that....

715
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:34,158
Did you have a good time?
Was it fun?

716
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:37,619
lt was all right.

717
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:42,249
You know, l'm really sorry
about getting all weird on you earlier.

718
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:45,002
lt's okay.
l guess Ginny Linstrom's dad...

719
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:47,463
...gave the same creepy lecture
to Cliffie Morgan.

720
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:55,220
Thank you for everything.

721
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,477
-Good night.
-Good night.

722
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,187
Good night.

723
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,052
We're not as far...

724
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,721
...on the automation and downsizing
as we had hoped.

725
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:42,309
That's because the robotic arms
are still in some warehouse in Japan.

726
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:45,729
lf we start to downsize, we're not
gonna have the workforce...

727
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:48,065
-...for instaIlation.
-This is costing us money.

728
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,858
l understand.

729
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,902
l wilI keep you apprised.

730
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:55,072
-We'Il talk next week then.
-All right.

731
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:57,324
Goodbye.

732
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:02,913
-Lucy Hill.
-Hey, Lucy, it's Ted.

733
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:05,082
Listen, I have this idea for Saturday.

734
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:09,628
l was thinking I could
pick you up around 8 in the morning.

735
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,923
Yeah, wear something
you can get dirty, okay?

736
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:15,217
Something dirty?

737
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:21,348
-Hey.
-Hi.

738
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:24,518
You....
You might wanna put these on.

739
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:26,937
What is it?

740
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:29,690
Crow hunting.

741
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:35,153
-But l don't wanna shoot a crow.
-You don't have to shoot a crow.

742
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:36,613
You can just shoot at them.

743
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:41,827
lt's a chance for you to get out,
you know, befriend the locals.

744
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:56,633
Stu. What's the chance of me
running into you out here?

745
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:58,468
Holy balls, why did you bring her?

746
00:59:58,636 --> 01:00:01,054
She said she wanted to get out,
do a little shooting.

747
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:02,514
Shooting?

748
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:04,975
You even got shells there, girlie?

749
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:07,978
Yeah. Yeah, l've got sheIls.

750
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:11,481
Oh, it's a great day.

751
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:17,321
Almost.

752
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:24,953
Okay, that's it. l gotta....

753
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:26,997
-What?
-I need to....

754
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:32,169
-What are you talking about?
-I need to pee.

755
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,592
You're kidding me, right?

756
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,678
Oh, for crying
in the beer-cheese soup.

757
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:44,431
Are you such a city girl
you can't pee outside?

758
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:49,061
You see, Stu, that's just one
of the advantages of being a city girl.

759
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:50,270
You don't have to.

760
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:54,191
Don't let the badgers
bite you in the ass.

761
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:56,652
Badgers? Really?

762
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:59,112
ls he serious?

763
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:05,869
Just in case.

764
01:01:40,738 --> 01:01:42,406
Oh, come on.

765
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:55,252
Ted!

766
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:01,425
Okay, where is it?
Where is it, where is it, where is it?

767
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:04,094
Where, where, where? Okay.

768
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:12,602
What?

769
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:16,606
You can really show a girl
a good time, you know?

770
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:19,234
l'm trying to give you a chance
to patch things up...

771
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:21,111
...if you would be a sport about it.

772
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:22,779
l'm being a sport.

773
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:24,906
But just-- l'm stuck.

774
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:27,325
Then talk to him about fishing.
He loves fishing--

775
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:29,786
No, no, no,
l'm not stuck for conversation.

776
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:34,249
-I'm stuck in your stupid overalls.
-All right, hold on.

777
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:43,049
Turn around.

778
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:46,636
Don't move.

779
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:51,224
Stop moving.

780
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:55,187
Okay, hold on, hold on.

781
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:58,482
Hold on a second.
Hold on, hoId on.

782
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:00,150
l got it.

783
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:02,694
Oh, that's not good.

784
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:11,161
-Turn around.
-Okay.

785
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:12,621
-No, wait--
-For real.

786
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:16,833
-What are you gonna do?
-Bend over.

787
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:18,168
Oh, okay, okay.

788
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:21,838
-Bend over.
-Hurry, just hurry.

789
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:24,174
Cool.

790
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:27,177
You could have just cut the zipper.

791
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:32,516
-Are you wearing a thong?
-You said something dirty.

792
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:35,560
l said what? l said wear something
you can get dirty.

793
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:37,187
Just go.

794
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:40,857
And don't watch. Go. Go.

795
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:42,776
Go!

796
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:01,753
-I'lI be damned.
-I'm not reaIly certain about that.

797
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:03,547
l did hear they knew each other....

798
01:04:03,714 --> 01:04:05,173
Sorry there, pal.

799
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:07,175
l didn't figure her for much of a shot.

800
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:10,554
Can you give me word
about Ted's condition?

801
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:14,307
Yes, I understand
it's a lower body injury.

802
01:04:14,475 --> 01:04:18,061
Somewhere around
the buttock area.

803
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:21,189
Some said the shooting
might be a lover's vendetta...

804
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:23,733
...or that the woman is deranged.

805
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:29,656
Oh, that's great.
The lead story on the news is my ass.

806
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:37,122
So you should sign off
on the spring mount there.

807
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,957
All right.

808
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:50,927
Very good.

809
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:01,104
Bobbie.

810
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:16,786
How you doing?

811
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:20,248
-I'm okay, how are you doing?
-Okay.

812
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:22,375
You baked?

813
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:25,587
Yes, l don't reaIly bake...

814
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:29,132
...but it seems to be the thing
that peopIe do around here.

815
01:05:29,508 --> 01:05:33,553
-I'm sorry, again.
-Oh, cake.

816
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:36,598
-Now you decide to show up?
-Hi, Bobbie.

817
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:42,729
-I think that means she forgives you.
-Okay.

818
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:45,148
Why don't you come in?

819
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:48,735
Mr. Arling on the line.

820
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:50,987
Oh, good.

821
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:54,366
Hey, did you look over the proposal?

822
01:05:54,533 --> 01:05:56,993
l know l can work
with the existing equipment.

823
01:05:58,829 --> 01:06:01,957
What do you mean, no product line?

824
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:06,044
You can't just decide Iike that.
l need to be in that meeting.

825
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,839
l understand.

826
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:11,800
Okay. l'Il see you tomorrow.

827
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:16,846
Blanche, l need to get
on the first flight to Miami.

828
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:23,019
l'm gonna need
my alternate production figures.

829
01:06:23,187 --> 01:06:25,522
They'll be in the confidential file
in my desk.

830
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,524
The key is in the center drawer.

831
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:31,194
-Okey-dokey artichokie.
-Thank you.

832
01:07:06,647 --> 01:07:09,065
The Rocket Bars test markets
are tanking.

833
01:07:09,233 --> 01:07:10,692
We're dumping the product line.

834
01:07:12,236 --> 01:07:13,319
And the plant.

835
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:16,698
Because it's worth more
to this company dead than alive.

836
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:18,241
Well, I disagree.

837
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:20,702
-That would be a terrible mistake.
-Lucy.

838
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,746
The people of New Ulm
are hardworking...

839
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:26,249
...and they could create an opportunity
that we should take advantage of.

840
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:28,251
Rocket Bars were the opportunity.

841
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:30,503
Well, then we'll reformulate
and rename them.

842
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:32,297
And we'll strategize with--

843
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:34,924
The product line is dead,
and so is the plant.

844
01:07:35,092 --> 01:07:37,635
We can't just write
these people's livelihoods off.

845
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:39,262
Lucy.

846
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:41,931
That's enough.

847
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:48,313
We need a timetable for shutdown.

848
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:49,939
We'll keep a skeleton crew on...

849
01:07:50,107 --> 01:07:53,193
...untiI we move
any remaining physical assets off-site.

850
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:23,932
Blanche.

851
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:28,061
You never said anything about layoffs.

852
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:30,480
Oh, no.

853
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:32,941
l made that a long time ago.

854
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,943
l made that list
before I even knew you.

855
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:38,154
And that's okay? It's okay
to pull the rug out from under folks...

856
01:08:38,322 --> 01:08:40,532
...as long as it's nobody
that you know?

857
01:08:40,699 --> 01:08:43,535
lt's okay because we're just
silly Podunk Minnesotans, right?

858
01:08:43,702 --> 01:08:46,121
We talk funny and we ice-fish
and we scrapbook...

859
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:49,541
...and we drag Jesus
into regular conversation.

860
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:54,003
We're not cool like you, right?
So we don't matter.

861
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:59,634
And it's okay to lie as long as you're
just pretending to be my friend.

862
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:04,180
l didn't lie. l just didn't tell you.

863
01:09:04,348 --> 01:09:07,350
Well, I mean it is the same thing.

864
01:09:08,727 --> 01:09:10,353
l guess l lied.

865
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:15,024
But l wasn't pretending, Blanche.
You are my friend.

866
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:18,736
Folks need to know, you know?

867
01:09:18,904 --> 01:09:21,698
They need to be able to file protests
with the union.

868
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:26,411
-Ted.
-I had to tell him.

869
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:29,706
Maybe you can keep
that kind of thing secret, but l can't.

870
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:33,793
Blanche, it gets so much worse.

871
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:36,129
Oh, yeah, what could be worse?

872
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:42,802
l just found out in Miami
that they wanna close the plant.

873
01:09:46,473 --> 01:09:49,392
l know that this is gonna sound
like a hollow promise to you...

874
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,270
...but l'm determined
to figure something out.

875
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:55,440
l really am. l mean,
there has to be something, right?

876
01:09:55,608 --> 01:10:00,737
l just-- You just can't eliminate
people's Iivelihoods, you know?

877
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:04,532
Sure you can.
lt happens all the time.

878
01:10:11,081 --> 01:10:13,917
Look, this doesn't mean
that we're friends or anything...

879
01:10:14,084 --> 01:10:15,793
...but when l get upset, I cook.

880
01:10:15,961 --> 01:10:19,422
And right now, me and Harve
are up to our ears in tapioca.

881
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,341
So there you go, okay?

882
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:49,577
Ted.

883
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:57,293
ls it true?

884
01:11:01,048 --> 01:11:03,800
Then we ain't got nothing to say.

885
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:54,058
Don't leave.

886
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:59,230
-Please, l need you here.
-To type pink slips?

887
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:02,650
Besides what's another couple
of months gonna make a difference?

888
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:04,861
l hope so.

889
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:08,865
Hey, let's talk tapioca.

890
01:12:09,366 --> 01:12:11,117
Okay.

891
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:15,038
Go ahead.

892
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:39,062
Hi there.

893
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:42,023
We're doing market research today
on a new product...

894
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:47,487
...called Power Pack Protein Pudding
with Fortified Zappy-oca.

895
01:12:47,654 --> 01:12:52,033
That's your fourth sample already.
That's enough Zappy-oca for you.

896
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:54,410
Keep them coming, Lucy.
lt's like a stampede.

897
01:12:54,578 --> 01:12:58,247
Go ahead.
lf you like it, just put in "l Iike it."

898
01:12:58,415 --> 01:13:00,750
Put a little nutmeg on top if you like.

899
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:02,752
And if you don't like, don't do it.

900
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:09,008
Every lassie, a champion skier
of the first water.

901
01:13:12,596 --> 01:13:15,932
That's called the forward squat.

902
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:23,272
What the hell are you doing here?

903
01:13:23,982 --> 01:13:25,775
l'm here to see Stu.

904
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:28,319
What the hell are you doing here,
Flo?

905
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:30,446
l live here.

906
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:34,075
Hey, Stanley.

907
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,619
Annie Oakley's here.

908
01:13:38,205 --> 01:13:40,915
You and Flo.

909
01:13:41,458 --> 01:13:43,292
Yeah, no....

910
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:49,173
Yeah, she's my ex-wife
and this is my ex-house.

911
01:13:49,341 --> 01:13:53,302
And now l pay rent
to live in my ex-basement.

912
01:13:54,638 --> 01:13:57,265
Ain't that a kick in the keister?

913
01:13:58,892 --> 01:14:02,895
So let's get back to that part
about you giving me my old job back.

914
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:06,315
Corporate is shutting down
the plant.

915
01:14:08,652 --> 01:14:10,987
Goddang--

916
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:14,031
-But--
-I knew this was gonna happen.

917
01:14:14,199 --> 01:14:16,576
-I have a plan.
-What is going on down there?

918
01:14:16,743 --> 01:14:19,996
None of your damn business,
you nosy old hoot owl!

919
01:14:27,671 --> 01:14:29,672
We've come up with a new product.

920
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,592
lf we can produce it
and test-market it in four weeks...

921
01:14:32,759 --> 01:14:36,679
...welI, then we can prove to corporate
that this plant is stiIl worthwhile.

922
01:14:37,514 --> 01:14:38,848
A month?

923
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:45,021
What? That's impossible.

924
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:50,693
l mean, you're just gonna get
everybody's hopes up...

925
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:53,196
...and then they'll all end up
out of work anyway.

926
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:58,117
-See, I think--
-No, l am not taking the fall for that.

927
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:01,621
You're on your own, lady.

928
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:22,099
So that's the plan,
and to make it work...

929
01:15:22,267 --> 01:15:25,561
...we're gonna recommission
the old-fashioned yogurt equipment.

930
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:27,480
lt's gonna take a lot of long hours.

931
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:30,233
How much overtime
are you authorized for?

932
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,400
None.

933
01:15:31,568 --> 01:15:33,236
And if the Munck-ees don't buy it?

934
01:15:33,403 --> 01:15:37,823
We'll put in a whole lot of work
and end up out on our asses anyway.

935
01:15:37,991 --> 01:15:42,161
Yeah, yeah, l'm not gonna lie to you.
The odds are that's what will happen.

936
01:15:42,329 --> 01:15:43,746
But if it's any consolation...

937
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:47,750
...l'm gonna be out of a job
right aIongside the rest of you.

938
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:51,671
l mean,
l am betting my career on this.

939
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:55,258
Why? l don't know.

940
01:15:55,425 --> 01:15:57,260
When l came here
did l think that this...

941
01:15:57,427 --> 01:15:59,929
...was gonna matter this much? No.

942
01:16:00,305 --> 01:16:03,849
But does it matter? Yeah.

943
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:08,229
Yeah, absolutely. lt matters a lot.

944
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:17,446
And you can sure betcha we'll be out
on our asses if we don't try.

945
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,326
You got something
better to do there, Lars?

946
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:25,663
And I gotta say l don't exactly
picture prospective employers...

947
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:28,499
...lining up to fight over
a dumb son of a bitch Iike Bob.

948
01:16:34,756 --> 01:16:39,302
They might padlock this place,
let the whole town come to rust.

949
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:44,307
But if that's the way it goes,
l don't wanna be thinking...

950
01:16:44,474 --> 01:16:48,811
...this gal offered a chance
and l didn't do a thing about it.

951
01:16:51,481 --> 01:16:53,482
You can count me in.

952
01:17:39,279 --> 01:17:41,364
They teach you that
in your management books?

953
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:46,369
ls this a surprise compliance visit
from the union?

954
01:17:46,536 --> 01:17:49,955
Maybe.
l heard about what you're doing.

955
01:17:54,586 --> 01:17:59,715
Look, l'm not sure why I came here,
but maybe l can help.

956
01:18:09,893 --> 01:18:13,604
Crank it a little bit more.
Yup, crank it, a little bit more.

957
01:18:15,232 --> 01:18:17,400
All right, Bob, turn her on.

958
01:18:19,152 --> 01:18:20,986
Hold it. Turn her off, Bob.

959
01:18:21,154 --> 01:18:23,322
-Great.
-Hang on, trade me spots here, Ted.

960
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:25,157
Okay, go on, get in there.

961
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:28,411
-Okay, let's do this other one.
-All right.

962
01:18:28,578 --> 01:18:30,204
Turn it on, please.

963
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:32,540
Put it off, Bob.

964
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:37,253
That's funny?

965
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:40,965
-No, no, no.
-Yeah, that's funny though.

966
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:43,759
Yeah, all right.
Bob, do me a favor, please turn it on.

967
01:19:07,033 --> 01:19:11,954
And I swear never to reveal
Blanche's secret tapioca recipe...

968
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:18,210
...to anyone from a rival company
or to Trudy Van Uuden.

969
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:21,464
l swear.

970
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,931
Mr. Arling
from the home office on line one.

971
01:20:12,098 --> 01:20:14,600
And if you ask me,
he doesn't sound any too pleased.

972
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:25,694
DonaId, funny you shouId call.

973
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:47,132
Yes, yes, Donald.

974
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:51,887
l do reaIize that l did this
with absolutely no authorization.

975
01:20:52,055 --> 01:20:53,514
Don't think l'm not pissed.

976
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:57,017
You'd be out on your ass if those
regional tests weren't off the charts.

977
01:20:57,185 --> 01:21:01,272
lt doesn't hurt that WaIlace's
grandkids are big on the butterscotch.

978
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:05,067
This is Blanche Gunderson.

979
01:21:05,235 --> 01:21:06,944
She's our head
of Product Development.

980
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:09,822
Oh, heavens no, l'm just....

981
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:12,533
Oh, I'm pleased as punch
to meet you.

982
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:14,702
-Yeah.
-Oh, l'm sorry.

983
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:16,579
-It's all right, it's okay.
-Oh, dear.

984
01:21:16,746 --> 01:21:18,539
Yeah, yeah.

985
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:22,751
Well, they never would have thought
it would be more cost-effective...

986
01:21:22,919 --> 01:21:27,590
...to use the current labor force and
the old machine line than robotics...

987
01:21:27,757 --> 01:21:29,758
...but we showed them.

988
01:21:29,926 --> 01:21:31,552
They want to ramp up production...

989
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:34,763
...and ship nationally
by the end of the month.

990
01:21:40,186 --> 01:21:42,897
How does it feel
to be the newest vice president?

991
01:21:43,064 --> 01:21:45,858
We'll expect you in Miami
next week.

992
01:22:03,293 --> 01:22:05,461
-Hey.
-Hi.

993
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:07,129
-How you doing?
-I'm all right.

994
01:22:07,297 --> 01:22:10,215
-How are you?
-I'm all right.

995
01:22:10,383 --> 01:22:13,093
lt's real noisy in there so....

996
01:22:13,678 --> 01:22:17,890
l thought l'd tell you goodbye
out here.

997
01:22:19,976 --> 01:22:24,438
You know, you've done some
pretty amazing things around here.

998
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:26,482
Thank you.

999
01:22:29,235 --> 01:22:32,988
Everybody in this whole town
is really gonna miss you a lot.

1000
01:22:37,494 --> 01:22:39,078
Especially me.

1001
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:50,089
There's people in there
waiting to give you a sendoff.

1002
01:22:50,256 --> 01:22:53,592
You don't want to miss that.
You may wanna....

1003
01:22:55,762 --> 01:22:57,554
Yeah.

1004
01:23:13,863 --> 01:23:17,366
-So l'll see you--
-Yeah, l'll be in there in a while.

1005
01:23:18,201 --> 01:23:19,743
Okay.

1006
01:23:54,529 --> 01:23:57,364
lt'll be nice getting back
to civilization.

1007
01:23:58,199 --> 01:24:00,117
How do people live here?

1008
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:54,189
How many queens
did you plant in this deck, Maurice?

1009
01:25:54,357 --> 01:25:57,151
Four or five, give or take a couple.

1010
01:25:58,695 --> 01:26:00,320
Hey, fellas.

1011
01:26:01,281 --> 01:26:04,324
Ted, we gotta talk.

1012
01:26:08,955 --> 01:26:10,956
Hey, Nina,
give me a Maker's Mark.

1013
01:26:14,127 --> 01:26:18,839
Well, it looks like we're just
too successful for our own damn good.

1014
01:26:19,215 --> 01:26:23,385
Just got wind from Fagerbache
in Distribution, the plant's being sold.

1015
01:26:23,553 --> 01:26:26,972
Some muckety-muck from HQ
is coming to tell us about it.

1016
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:28,599
Sold?

1017
01:26:28,766 --> 01:26:30,684
Yeah, it's a heck of a deal.

1018
01:26:30,852 --> 01:26:33,353
They're gonna move
our product line out of here.

1019
01:26:33,521 --> 01:26:36,356
Faster than thin shit
through a tall Swede.

1020
01:26:36,524 --> 01:26:39,610
l'm surprised your little sweetie-pie
vice president...

1021
01:26:39,777 --> 01:26:42,196
...didn't send you the memo.

1022
01:26:57,128 --> 01:26:58,420
So ridicuIous.

1023
01:26:58,588 --> 01:27:01,965
lt was my secret, now it's being
shipped off with the plant.

1024
01:27:14,395 --> 01:27:16,855
Yeah, well, l'm not gonna accept
anything less...

1025
01:27:17,023 --> 01:27:20,025
...than two weeks' salary
for every year worked.

1026
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:51,807
l understand that you've heard...

1027
01:27:51,975 --> 01:27:55,435
...of Munck Foods' planned sale
of this facility.

1028
01:27:55,979 --> 01:27:57,562
Yeah.

1029
01:27:59,357 --> 01:28:02,943
Well, I've assembled
some industrial investors...

1030
01:28:03,486 --> 01:28:07,489
...to back us in buying this plant,
product line and all.

1031
01:28:07,657 --> 01:28:10,534
At a fixed rate,
you'll buy the new company back...

1032
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:14,746
...untiI it is entirely owner-operated.

1033
01:28:16,165 --> 01:28:18,500
Well, how do we know
we can we trust these guys?

1034
01:28:18,668 --> 01:28:20,002
Yeah.

1035
01:28:21,004 --> 01:28:22,838
You won't have to.

1036
01:28:23,923 --> 01:28:26,008
You can trust me.

1037
01:28:27,802 --> 01:28:31,805
l wanna come back
as this company's CEO.

1038
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:35,017
Well, would you look at Miss CEO?

1039
01:28:35,184 --> 01:28:38,645
As I recall, first,
you got us to risk everything.

1040
01:28:38,813 --> 01:28:42,691
Then you left us behind, you know?

1041
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:45,736
And then you got them...

1042
01:28:45,903 --> 01:28:48,530
...to buy the company
out right from under our feet.

1043
01:28:48,698 --> 01:28:51,033
And now you have this idea...

1044
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:53,785
...about how we're supposed
to buy our own company back.

1045
01:28:53,953 --> 01:28:55,454
Well, that changes everything.

1046
01:28:58,124 --> 01:29:01,168
Are you prepared
to deal with the union on this?

1047
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:11,219
l'm sure we could come
to some agreement.

1048
01:29:11,888 --> 01:29:15,474
lt's gonna take a little bit of time too,
it might take years.

1049
01:29:20,646 --> 01:29:22,898
My schedule's open.

1050
01:29:34,243 --> 01:29:37,662
-Whoa, there, buddy, you're not--
-Hey, I just have something in my eye.

1051
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:39,331
Damn it.

1052
01:30:18,121 --> 01:30:19,788
Now....

1053
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:22,457
What about Johann Weinkopf?

1054
01:30:23,126 --> 01:30:25,419
Why, he'd make you
a mighty fine husband.

1055
01:30:25,586 --> 01:30:26,628
He's got a lazy eye.

1056
01:30:26,796 --> 01:30:31,049
And I can never tell if he's looking
directly at me or my breast.

1057
01:30:31,217 --> 01:30:33,468
Probably looking at both.

1058
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:36,555
Now that I think about it,
you're probably right.

1059
01:30:36,973 --> 01:30:38,265
Go on.

1060
01:30:39,434 --> 01:30:41,726
-Oh, hi there, Peter.
-Here you go.

1061
01:30:48,067 --> 01:30:49,609
-So....
-Okay, then.

1062
01:30:49,777 --> 01:30:51,820
-You have a nice day.
-Enjoy the weather.
