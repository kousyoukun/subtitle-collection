They put a man on the moon

16
01:52:53,417 --> 01:52:56,375

From your eyes

There's a new planet
in the solar system

38

that were never there

41
01:54:44,917 --> 01:54:48,833
Over my shoulder

42
01:54:48,917 --> 01:54:53,708
Crashing to the ground

43
01:54:53,792 --> 01:54:57,833
I'm breaking through
I'm bending spoons

44

I'm keepin' flowers
in full bloom

45
01:55:02,083 --> 01:55:07,167
I'm looking for answers
from the great beyond

46
01:55:26,250 --> 01:55:29,500
