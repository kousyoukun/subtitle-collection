00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:45,977
- Jody, right?
- What's your name again?


71
00:02:45,977 --> 00:02:47,847
As you can see,
that is not my chin.


72
00:02:47,847 --> 00:02:50,080
When you look at my face, look
at my jaw compared to his jaw,


73
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,752
it's like his chin is off.


74
00:02:51,752 --> 00:02:52,919
It's like... -Yeah,
we can't replace his face.


75
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,591
It's like Mr. Potato Head.


76
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,493
I mean, no offense or
anything, but you know. -Oh...


77
00:02:56,493 --> 00:02:58,594
Oh, yeah, no. Sorry, I got lost
in your beautiful jawline.


78
00:02:58,594 --> 00:03:00,399
- It's dreamy.
-  No, listen,

it's not working for us.

85
00:03:10,034 --> 00:03:11,903

86
00:03:11,903 --> 00:03:13,939
Maybe you could do it backwards
or something? I don't know.


87
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:16,105
- It's just... less face.
- Yeah.


88
00:03:16,105 --> 00:03:17,579

freebasing the Diet Coke


89

00:03:33,597 --> 00:03:35,367
Copy that, Colt.
We'll flip the rig. -Thank you.


100
00:03:35,366 --> 00:03:37,027
You'll be falling backwards.


101
00:03:37,027 --> 00:03:38,798
Jody, go to two. -SECOND A.D.:

104
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,477
Uh, yeah. It just looked
just now like you wanted


105
00:03:45,477 --> 00:03:47,235
- to ask me something.
- Oh.


106
00:03:47,235 --> 00:03:49,414
I was gonna go for
a spicy margarita after work.


107
00:03:49,414 --> 00:03:51,316
I was wondering
if you drink spicy margaritas.


108
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:56,112
Um, well,
just to keep it professional,


109
00:03:56,112 --> 00:03:57,950
I can only have
one spicy margarita.


110
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,953
Because if I have two,
I start making bad decisions.


111
00:04:00,953 --> 00:04:02,790
Well, you know,
drinking margaritas


112
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,594
is all about
making bad decisions.


113
00:04:05,594 --> 00:04:07,763
Which reminds me, um,


114
00:04:07,763 --> 00:04:11,063
after this job, I-I got to go
sit on the sand somewhere,


115
00:04:11,062 --> 00:04:13,668
and I was wondering, uh...
I was gonna ask you a question.


116
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:15,166
Tell me.


117
00:04:16,267 --> 00:04:18,640
Do you have any towels
that I can borrow?


118
00:04:19,971 --> 00:04:21,478
Yeah, I have some towels.


119
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,239
You know, it's so dangerous
to swim alone.


120
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:27,144
Well, I would ask you to,
you know, be my swim buddy,


121
00:04:27,144 --> 00:04:29,146
but I don't know
if you have a bathing suit.


122
00:04:29,146 --> 00:04:32,521
Wait a second. What do you
call that across the pond?


123
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:35,460
We call it a swimming costume.


124
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:39,156
Imagine that.


125
00:04:39,156 --> 00:04:41,156
After this,
you and I could both be


126
00:04:41,158 --> 00:04:43,963
on the beach somewhere
in swimming costumes


127
00:04:43,963 --> 00:04:45,768
drinking spicy margaritas,


128
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:48,131

-Okay, good to go.


129
00:04:48,132 --> 00:04:49,870

locked up all around!


131
00:04:55,173 --> 00:04:57,240

00:04:58,584 --> 00:05:00,242
- Speed on "A."


133
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:05,523
You all right? -All right,
let's take him to ones.


134
00:05:05,523 --> 00:05:08,725

- Go ahead and sit back for me.

- How we doing up there, stunt?


138
00:05:15,896 --> 00:05:18,899
- Great. He's great. Here we go.
- Position down.

140
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:24,838

141
00:05:24,838 --> 00:05:27,545

149
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,346
Well, they don't mention


150
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:11,721
that it sticks around
afterwards, too.


151
00:06:13,382 --> 00:06:15,384
Jody tried so hard
to be there for me.


152
00:06:15,384 --> 00:06:17,057
She really did. I just...


153
00:06:17,057 --> 00:06:18,761
I couldn't do it.


154
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:23,963
Then I just
disappeared completely.


155
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,804
Well...


156
00:06:27,803 --> 00:06:30,332
- at least I thought I did.


157
00:06:39,584 --> 00:06:40,584
Hello?


158
00:06:40,584 --> 00:06:42,553
Oh! Colt!


159
00:06:42,553 --> 00:06:44,149
It's Gail.


160
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:46,790
- Your favorite producer.
- How'd you get this number?


161
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:50,122
Someone said you were working
at the Captain's Cockatoo.


162
00:06:50,122 --> 00:06:51,256
A valet.


163
00:06:51,255 --> 00:06:53,466
Wow! I didn't believe it.


164
00:06:53,466 --> 00:06:56,502
It's actually
El Cacatúa del Capitan.


165
00:06:56,502 --> 00:06:59,394
It's a family-run place.
We pool tips.


166
00:07:01,507 --> 00:07:04,004
Plus, I get
all the burritos I can eat.


167
00:07:04,004 --> 00:07:05,906
Kind of living the dream
if you think about it.


168
00:07:05,906 --> 00:07:08,271
Break time's over.
You've got a customer.


169
00:07:08,273 --> 00:07:09,747
Number 43.


170
00:07:10,846 --> 00:07:12,816
- Hey.


171
00:07:14,622 --> 00:07:16,919
Yo, bro, I know you
from somewhere.


172
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:18,622
Where I know you from, bro?


173
00:07:18,622 --> 00:07:22,086
Oh, yeah, you were on
that Tom Ryder movie I was on.


174
00:07:22,088 --> 00:07:24,289
- You're the stunt guy!
- Not anymore.


175
00:07:24,288 --> 00:07:27,026
Did you, like, break your back
or some shit? -I did, yeah.


176
00:07:27,028 --> 00:07:31,196
I know things haven't been easy
for you since... the incident.


177
00:07:31,196 --> 00:07:32,835
And I just hope


178
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:35,837
that you don't hold it
against me or Tom.


179
00:07:35,838 --> 00:07:38,302
You know, we were
absolutely devastated.


180
00:07:38,302 --> 00:07:39,709
He sent you a message, right?


181
00:07:42,144 --> 00:07:43,439
The prayer hands emoji?


182
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,014
Right, yeah.
He's still an asshole.


183
00:07:46,014 --> 00:07:47,850
How are you even still alive?
Yo, babe.


184
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,555
- Babe, hey, come here.
- I don't know.


185
00:07:49,555 --> 00:07:50,853
- I wish I wasn't right now.
- You got to meet this guy.


186
00:07:50,853 --> 00:07:52,348
Come here.
You got to hear this.


187
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,220
You don't have to hear this.
It's fine. Hi.


188
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,792
This dude was on a movie
I was on.


189
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:59,894
- Most epic fail I've ever seen.
-Mm.


190
00:07:59,894 --> 00:08:01,567
I don't blame
either one of you, Gail.


191
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:03,062
That was my fault.


192
00:08:03,062 --> 00:08:04,867
And when you start
making mistakes like that,


193
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:06,298
it's time to hang up the pads.


194
00:08:06,298 --> 00:08:08,002
Oh, it was an accident, Colt.


195
00:08:08,002 --> 00:08:10,136
Everybody knows that.


196
00:08:10,136 --> 00:08:14,503
Tom has put me
in a real situation here, Colt.


197
00:08:14,502 --> 00:08:17,406
I just need a little bit
of help from an old friend,


198
00:08:17,406 --> 00:08:20,014
who just happens to be,
you know, the best stuntman


199
00:08:20,014 --> 00:08:21,817
I've ever worked with
in my life.


200
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:24,217
Which is why you are getting
on a plane for me tomorrow


201
00:08:24,216 --> 00:08:25,822
and coming to Sydney.


202
00:08:25,822 --> 00:08:27,560
I'm not getting
on a plane, Gail.


203
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,561
I can't bear that you would
throw away all that talent.


204
00:08:29,562 --> 00:08:31,992
You shouldn't be
parking cars, Colt.


205
00:08:31,992 --> 00:08:34,663
You need to be smashing
burning Kawasakis


206
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:35,898
through panes of glass.


207
00:08:35,898 --> 00:08:38,263
Yo, fall guy? Yo.


208
00:08:38,263 --> 00:08:41,398
Bring my car back
without a scratch,


209
00:08:41,398 --> 00:08:43,576
I got a crispy fiver
here for you, bro.


210
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,062
Come on.
It's gonna be like old times.


211
00:09:08,062 --> 00:09:09,734
I know you've missed it.


212
00:09:09,734 --> 00:09:11,065
Goodbye, Gail.


213
00:09:11,065 --> 00:09:13,067
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait. Hold on.


214
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:15,201
Did I, did I tell you-- I--
Did I tell you


215
00:09:15,201 --> 00:09:16,905
that the director's
asked for you specifically?


216
00:09:16,905 --> 00:09:18,533
Sorry to disappoint him.


217
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:20,437
Well, don't you want
to know who it is? -Nope.

riding shotgun
in someone else's story


228
00:09:39,126 --> 00:09:41,964

I didn't realize they were,
uh, scanning doubles now.


252
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:25,903
Eh, it's new technology.


253
00:11:25,903 --> 00:11:28,070
Basically, we use
the geometry of your face


254
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,666
to retarget Ryder's face,


255
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,174
and we put Ryder's face
back on top of your face.


256
00:11:32,173 --> 00:11:34,846
Like a deepfake situation.


257
00:11:34,846 --> 00:11:37,442
If you get a chance, turn me
into Tom Cruise, would you?


258
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:41,280
Hey, welcome to Sydney.
Are you Colt Seavers?


259
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,756
Yeah. Hey. Do you know
where I can get some coffee?


260
00:11:43,756 --> 00:11:45,515
This jet lag
is really kicking in.


261
00:11:45,515 --> 00:11:46,890
Yeah, no stress. I got you.


262
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,761
And does the director know
I'm here?


263
00:11:48,761 --> 00:11:50,058
- She asked for me.
- Uh...


264
00:11:50,058 --> 00:11:51,256
Does-does she want
to say hi or...?


265
00:11:51,258 --> 00:11:53,228
I haven't heard.
No, sorry, bro.


266
00:11:53,227 --> 00:11:54,966
Uh, but the stunt coordinator
wants to see you.


267
00:11:54,966 --> 00:11:57,462
- He's just in the jacket there.
- Okay, great.


268
00:11:57,462 --> 00:11:59,298
Will you just tell her
I'm here and...


269
00:11:59,298 --> 00:12:00,871
you know, that coffee
if you get a chance?


270
00:12:00,871 --> 00:12:02,137
Oh.


271
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,633
- Dan Tucker.


272
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:06,406
Big-time Hollywood
stunt coordinator.


273
00:12:07,605 --> 00:12:08,947
It's about time.


274
00:12:08,947 --> 00:12:10,606
- Congratulations.


275
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:12,246
Thank you. Look at you.


276
00:12:12,246 --> 00:12:14,447
So do I call you "sir" now,
or how does that work?


277
00:12:14,447 --> 00:12:16,381
Oh, feel free
to call me "boss," you know.


278
00:12:16,381 --> 00:12:17,921
- Okay, boss.


279
00:12:17,922 --> 00:12:19,749
I don't think I should be
in this Nomex, right?


280
00:12:19,749 --> 00:12:21,619
I mean, it's like, we're not
doing anything crazy, are we?


281
00:12:21,619 --> 00:12:23,059
I was just about
to explain that.


282
00:12:23,058 --> 00:12:24,895
A cannon roll?!


283
00:12:24,895 --> 00:12:26,722
It's time for you to start
rolling cars again


284
00:12:26,722 --> 00:12:28,097
instead of parking them.


285
00:12:28,097 --> 00:12:30,165
You had an accident.


286
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,432
It was a massive
miscalculation of the rig.


287
00:12:33,432 --> 00:12:35,235
I-I almost killed myself
in front of the whole crew.


288
00:12:35,235 --> 00:12:37,403
You know, I'd rather just not
have my first stunt back


289
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:39,570
be another epic failure,
especially in front of Jody.


290
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,078
I mean, you understand.


291
00:12:41,077 --> 00:12:43,673
"It's not about how hard
of a hit you can give."


292
00:12:43,673 --> 00:12:45,674
- Oh.
-"It's about how many times


293
00:12:45,676 --> 00:12:49,580
you can get hit and keep
moving forward." -Come on.


294
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,825
That's messed up. You can't
quote Rocky on me like that.


295
00:12:52,825 --> 00:12:55,619
So it's a laser gun
with a dagger?


296
00:12:55,619 --> 00:12:57,358
Yes,
like a bayonet. -Right.


297
00:12:57,357 --> 00:12:59,029
Do we need the bayonet?
Wouldn't the laser achieve...


298
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,658
On the battlefield, yes.
Hundred percent.


299
00:13:00,658 --> 00:13:02,528
It just gives it
a quite a strange shape.


300
00:13:02,528 --> 00:13:04,100
- Oh, this guitar bit at the end?
- Yeah.


301
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,761
Yeah, well, you said
you wanted metal,


302
00:13:05,761 --> 00:13:07,267
so it's, like, heavy metal.


303
00:13:07,268 --> 00:13:09,105
Okay, how-how... how many
have you done like this?


304
00:13:09,105 --> 00:13:10,437
- Uh, two.
- Okay. Good.


305
00:13:10,437 --> 00:13:12,504
- Hundred.
- Ooh. Okay. Yeah, fantastic.


306
00:13:12,504 --> 00:13:14,705
- Thanks, boss.
- Okay. It looks like a guitar.


307
00:13:14,705 --> 00:13:16,639
Yes. -Nigel, how we doing
on the pyrotechnics?


308
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,279
What's going on? -I think we
only have enough for one take.


309
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:19,884
- Boss! Boss, listen.
- No. Come on. -Yes.


310
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:21,611
Yes? -We could create
something that looks


311
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:23,184
- way more realistic with VFX.
- No, no, no.


312
00:13:23,184 --> 00:13:24,548
- Come on. Give it to me.
- Venti, Venti, Venti.


313
00:13:24,548 --> 00:13:26,121
I don't want real.
I don't want real.


314
00:13:26,121 --> 00:13:28,125
This is a sci-fi epic,
cosmic love story. -Why?


315
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,687
Okay? Of cosmic proportions.


316
00:13:29,687 --> 00:13:31,656
It's got to mirror
that otherworldly thing


317
00:13:31,655 --> 00:13:33,228
when you fall in love.


318
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,692
You know, it's-it's imperfect.
It's beautiful.


319
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:36,197
I want it that way, okay?


320
00:13:36,197 --> 00:13:38,134
Let's go big with
our one take, okay? -Okay.


321
00:13:38,134 --> 00:13:39,466
- Holy shit.


322
00:13:39,466 --> 00:13:40,663
Was that it?
Was that my one take?


323
00:13:40,663 --> 00:13:41,830
Uh, I'm sure we have--


324
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,634
- Oh, my God!


325
00:13:43,634 --> 00:13:45,140
Well, I got to say, though,
looks absolutely fantastic.


326
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,405
-Boss. Listen, listen.
- Look at that.


327
00:13:46,405 --> 00:13:48,077
You sure you want
to use real pyros?


328
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,376
Yeah. -VENTI: But we
definitely don't need this.


329
00:13:49,376 --> 00:13:50,882
- No, no, no, no. Yeah.
- We don't.


330
00:13:50,883 --> 00:13:52,182
Well, we're just gonna
have to loop the actors.


331
00:13:52,182 --> 00:13:53,677
- That's all.
- That's okay, Ray.


332
00:13:53,677 --> 00:13:55,317
It's a stuntman in a car
with a helmet on, okay?


333
00:13:55,317 --> 00:13:56,712
- Oh. Uh, all right.
- No looping. No monologuing.


334
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:57,645
What the hell is going on
over there, Rush?


335
00:13:57,648 --> 00:13:58,923
We did not call for pyro.


336
00:13:58,923 --> 00:14:00,222
I will seriously
track down your family


337
00:14:00,222 --> 00:14:01,519
and kill every last one of them!


338
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,192
This is why they're doing it.


339
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:04,996
'Cause they feel you don't
respect them, Nigel, okay?


340
00:14:04,996 --> 00:14:06,591
It's my tone. -Your tone,
your words, all of it, just...


341
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,933
- I see, okay. -Jody? Jody?
- Darla, yes? Okay. Yeah.


342
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:10,693
Jody, um, sorry, I...
I couldn't get my printer


343
00:14:10,695 --> 00:14:12,169
- working last night...
- Okay, yep.


344
00:14:12,168 --> 00:14:13,663
...but I sort of synthesized
our conversation


345
00:14:13,663 --> 00:14:15,501
that we had on the third act,
and what if


346
00:14:15,501 --> 00:14:18,504
one of the characters in the
film acknowledges in the film


347
00:14:18,504 --> 00:14:20,769
that we're having a problem
with the third act?


348
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:22,539
- Yeah?
- No. No.


349
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:23,872
But I appreciate you thinking
outside the box, Darla.


350
00:14:23,871 --> 00:14:25,048
- I really, really do.


351
00:14:25,048 --> 00:14:26,842
Nigel, you've got to stop them.


352
00:14:26,842 --> 00:14:28,183
I will gut you like the pigs
that you are! -Oh, my God.


353
00:14:28,183 --> 00:14:29,679
- Stop testing!
- Whoo!


354
00:14:29,681 --> 00:14:31,056
-Boss!
- Yep?


355
00:14:31,056 --> 00:14:33,091
- Test went well.
- Fantastic.


356
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:35,884
Okay, so, guys, simmer down.
Eyes on me.


357
00:14:35,884 --> 00:14:37,423
Here's what's gonna happen.


358
00:14:37,423 --> 00:14:39,227
No VFX, Venti.
It looks absolutely fabulous.


359
00:14:39,229 --> 00:14:41,098
Nigel, we need to shoot now.
The tide's coming in.


360
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:42,462
Let's go.
The shot's gonna be epic.


361
00:14:42,462 --> 00:14:44,793
Shot's up in five, people.
Thank you.


362
00:14:55,984 --> 00:14:57,609
-Colt? Brother?


363
00:14:57,609 --> 00:14:59,479
What's happening, man?


364
00:15:00,945 --> 00:15:02,780
- Bad sand.
- Bad sand.


365
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:04,318
Yeah.


366
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,156
I think we got to postpone.
Hate to say it.


367
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,125
NIGEL
Dan, what's the delay, please?


368
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,094
Uh, we're just doing
a little safety check.


369
00:15:10,094 --> 00:15:11,393
It's the density.
It's bad density.


370
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:13,263
We're looking at
the density of the sand.


371
00:15:13,263 --> 00:15:14,494
There's a new driver.


372
00:15:14,494 --> 00:15:16,067
- Who is it? Where's Henry?
- No idea.


373
00:15:16,067 --> 00:15:18,268
Nigel, this is
the biggest shot of the film,


374
00:15:18,268 --> 00:15:19,763
and I have a newbie.


375
00:15:20,798 --> 00:15:22,600
- Dan says we can do it.
- Okay.


376
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,405
Seriously, we're gonna drift
all over the place.


377
00:15:25,405 --> 00:15:27,077
What is that, a king tide?


378
00:15:27,077 --> 00:15:28,804
Here's what you do.
You wait till it comes in.


379
00:15:28,806 --> 00:15:31,445
It compacts the sand,
then we shoot sunset for sunup.


380
00:15:31,445 --> 00:15:32,611
You're stalling.


381
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,349
- Maybe.
- You're stalling.


382
00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:37,254
Two things can be true.
-Brother, I've got


383
00:15:37,254 --> 00:15:39,750
a tent full of
rookie Australians out here.


384
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,950
I'm gonna be sick.


385
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,622
You got this. You're the one.


386
00:15:42,621 --> 00:15:43,621
- Why you got to say that?
- Okay?


387
00:15:43,621 --> 00:15:44,788
Why you got to say that?


388
00:15:44,788 --> 00:15:46,263
You've done this
a million times.


389
00:15:46,263 --> 00:15:48,297
And so have you.
You know, you just jinxed it.


390
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,035
You just jinxed it!


391
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:52,500
Hey, Dan, I need the driver
in the car now, please.


392
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,830
- Okay, the tide's coming up.
-Okay.


393
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,007
Thank you so much.
Appreciate you.


394
00:15:55,006 --> 00:15:56,040
- Is that Jody?
- Yes, it's Jody.


395
00:15:57,966 --> 00:15:59,538
She say something about me?


396
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:02,807
Stop with-- your-your face.
Stop it. Stop it.


397
00:16:02,807 --> 00:16:05,116
She didn't say
anything about you.


398
00:16:05,116 --> 00:16:06,842
Get in the car!


399
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,319
This is really important to her.


400
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,948
Yes, it's important to her.


401
00:16:12,947 --> 00:16:15,389
- Is this Comic-Con or something?
- Hall H.


402
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:18,229
"This is one of those times,


403
00:16:18,229 --> 00:16:21,429
whether it's an inch or a mile,
a win is a win."


404
00:16:23,763 --> 00:16:25,466
That's easy.
Fast and the Furious.


405
00:16:25,466 --> 00:16:26,895
Ah!


406
00:16:26,895 --> 00:16:29,040
- Let's go. You got this.


407
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,372
Did you see the coffee lady?


408
00:16:30,371 --> 00:16:31,572
She was wearing, like, a hat.


409
00:16:31,572 --> 00:16:33,077
- I see you in the car.
- Okay.


410
00:16:34,246 --> 00:16:35,740
Let's get
the medics in place, please.


411
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,808
This is the hero set.
I've got five more after that.


412
00:16:37,808 --> 00:16:39,216
Are you ready, Dan? Yeah.


413
00:16:39,216 --> 00:16:41,383
-Rock and roll.
-Lock it up!


414
00:16:41,383 --> 00:16:43,418
-Thank you.
-Three minute away--


415
00:16:44,455 --> 00:16:45,585
NIGEL
Okay, folks,


416
00:16:45,585 --> 00:16:47,093
he's buckled in.
Stunts are ready.


417
00:16:47,092 --> 00:16:48,654
MAN
Godspeed, Colt.


418
00:16:48,654 --> 00:16:50,424
Everybody knows their spots.


419
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,427
Everybody knows
their responsibilities.


420
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:53,658
NIGEL
FX, please go hot on the cannon.


421
00:16:53,658 --> 00:16:55,164
Do this right.


422
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,596
MAN
Okay, engaging the cannon now.


423
00:16:56,596 --> 00:16:58,070
We do this safe
and everybody goes home.


424
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,666
MAN 2
Charging the cannon.


425
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,206
MAN
2,000 PSI in the cannon.


426
00:17:02,206 --> 00:17:03,866
Stunts is good.


427
00:17:03,866 --> 00:17:05,902
MAN 2
Cannon is hot.


428
00:17:05,902 --> 00:17:07,509
NIGEL
Cameras, where are we at?


429
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:09,005
Are you rolling? Camera one?


430
00:17:09,005 --> 00:17:10,412
-Speed on one.
-Camera two?


431
00:17:10,412 --> 00:17:11,875
-Speed.
-Camera three?


432
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,250
-Speed on three.


433
00:17:17,717 --> 00:17:21,358
Background.
And three, two, one.


434
00:17:21,357 --> 00:17:22,952
Action, action, action!


435
00:17:28,597 --> 00:17:30,026
All right, guys, stay frosty.


436
00:17:30,026 --> 00:17:32,072
NIGEL
Three, two, one!


437
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,477
Dan, I need him close to the
camera now. -DAN: Copy that!


438
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:44,314
Look,
I don't want to be that guy,


439
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:45,777
but the sand's a little loose.


440
00:17:45,777 --> 00:17:47,548
I can't get any traction.


441
00:17:47,548 --> 00:17:49,286
When I do, it jumps,


442
00:17:49,286 --> 00:17:51,916
so if you get any closer,
you're gonna lose the camera.


443
00:17:51,915 --> 00:17:53,619
I know, I know,
but get in there.


444
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:55,687
- You got this, baby!
- Move up, move up.


445
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,660
No, no, not that close.
Oh. What the--


446
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,090
NIGEL
Keep rolling.


447
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:03,628
We have seven more cameras.
Keep rolling!


448
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,633
Okay!


449
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:08,536
Ready in three, two, one!


450
00:18:33,365 --> 00:18:34,759
NIGEL
Nobody goes in


451
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:36,333
until stunts gives
the all clear.


452
00:18:43,869 --> 00:18:45,309
- Is he all right?
- Colt, you all right?


453
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:47,278
Quickly, get him.
Come on, get him.


454
00:18:47,278 --> 00:18:48,708
- Just get in there.
-Oh, my God.


455
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:51,613
- Easy, easy.
-Colt, you did it!


456
00:18:51,613 --> 00:18:53,350
Eight and a half rolls!


457
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:55,550
Come on, you okay? You good?


458
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:58,355
You good? Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.


459
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:02,359
Jody's coming. Hold on. Okay.


460
00:19:02,358 --> 00:19:03,789
So good, Dan. Is he good?


461
00:19:03,789 --> 00:19:05,119
- Yeah, of course.
- So good, so good.


462
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:06,957
Loved it, loved it.


463
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,498
- Incredible.
- Okay.


464
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,675
Whose idea was this?


465
00:19:21,171 --> 00:19:23,249
- I think it was Gail's idea.
- I thought it was your idea.


466
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:25,348
I-I just found out
about this yesterday.


467
00:19:25,348 --> 00:19:27,076
Dan, come on.


468
00:19:27,076 --> 00:19:29,682
I didn't approve him.
I didn't approve him.


469
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:31,145
I would never have approved him.


470
00:19:31,145 --> 00:19:32,258
- She didn't approve me.


471
00:19:32,258 --> 00:19:33,357
Can I talk to you for a second?


472
00:19:33,357 --> 00:19:34,523
I'm not approved.


473
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:36,393
Interesting move. Really.


474
00:19:36,394 --> 00:19:39,395
Really interesting.
Just very casual.


475
00:19:39,395 --> 00:19:43,090
Here you are, you show up,
and, "I'm your new stuntman."


476
00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:58,282
Don't do that.
You can't do that. -What?


477
00:19:58,284 --> 00:19:59,978
- Directing a movie.
- Your hat's coming off.


478
00:20:01,718 --> 00:20:03,354
Why are you here?


479
00:20:03,354 --> 00:20:05,587
I think there's been
a misunderstanding. -Clearly.


480
00:20:05,587 --> 00:20:08,425
Because I was under
the impression that...


481
00:20:09,724 --> 00:20:11,427
...you did want me here.


482
00:20:11,428 --> 00:20:13,188
That's a delusional thought.
We haven't spoken in a year.


483
00:20:13,188 --> 00:20:14,531
- Let's not get into it.
- Gail, Gail-- But Gail told me


484
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,367
- that you wanted me here.
- Okay. Whatever.


485
00:20:16,367 --> 00:20:17,864
I don't even care about it,
but you clipped the camera.


486
00:20:17,864 --> 00:20:20,229
I-I-I'm a little rusty.


487
00:20:20,229 --> 00:20:21,967
- Comic-Con shot ruined.
- I'm sor-- I know.


488
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:24,134
- Hall H. It's a big deal.
- Yeah. Yeah.


489
00:20:24,134 --> 00:20:26,134
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.


490
00:20:26,134 --> 00:20:28,136
I'm happy for you.


491
00:20:31,175 --> 00:20:33,580
This whole director thing
looks good on you.


492
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,079
Even the gardening hat, somehow.


493
00:20:36,078 --> 00:20:39,654
Everyone wears them.
It's like a set thing.


494
00:20:39,654 --> 00:20:41,722
- Okay?
- Yeah, I see it. It's--


495
00:20:41,722 --> 00:20:43,888
They're not making it look
as good as you are, that's all.


496
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,595
And I'm not trying to be fla--
I'm just saying the facts.


497
00:20:46,595 --> 00:20:48,400
But you look good in everything.


498
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,831
You look good in nothing.
Whatever.


499
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,567
- No, I don't mean it like that.
- Really? This isn't...


500
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:53,964
But you do look good
in nothing. -This isn't work--


501
00:20:53,964 --> 00:20:55,339
- This isn't gonna work.
- I mean, you do.


502
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:57,309
But it's not what I...


503
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:01,346
- I'll take anyone. Anyone else.
- Yeah.


504
00:21:01,346 --> 00:21:03,106
- Anyone but him.
-Can I be honest with you?


505
00:21:03,106 --> 00:21:05,384
- Who have you got? Yep.
- We literally have no one else.


506
00:21:06,946 --> 00:21:09,353
- What's next?
-The fire burn.


507
00:21:11,182 --> 00:21:12,918
It's your call.


508
00:21:12,917 --> 00:21:14,688
Okay. -NIGEL: Can we get
a nurse on standby, please?


509
00:21:14,689 --> 00:21:16,461
We're gonna set
this man on fire.


510
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,205
JODY
Cut, cut, cut. -That's a cut.


511
00:21:36,205 --> 00:21:38,482
-Cutting there, please.
-That's a cut!


512
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:43,355
How you feeling, Colt Seavers?


513
00:21:43,355 --> 00:21:44,687
-He's good.
-He's all good.


514
00:21:44,686 --> 00:21:46,853
We're gonna go again.
Thumbs-up, okay?


515
00:21:46,854 --> 00:21:48,317
Technical issue.
Little bump on the dolly.


516
00:21:48,317 --> 00:21:50,724
- Huh?
- Can you fix that, Jimmy?


517
00:21:50,724 --> 00:21:52,320
- Back to ones, please.
- Thank you.


518
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,190
-Going again.
-Please, back to one.


519
00:21:54,191 --> 00:21:56,125
Colt, do you feel a bit
flung into the deep end here?


520
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,292
I'm just wondering, 'cause
you haven't read the script,


521
00:21:58,292 --> 00:21:59,634
if you'd like some backstory,
some context?


522
00:21:59,634 --> 00:22:01,571
- Would that be good?
- Just go with it.


523
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,232
Yeah, helpful?
Okay. Here we go.


524
00:22:03,232 --> 00:22:06,070
So, sci-fi love story,
two characters,


525
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,302
one of them's an alien--
Aliena--


526
00:22:08,303 --> 00:22:10,041
and you're Space Cowboy.


527
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,975
They shared what's called
a moon season.


528
00:22:11,978 --> 00:22:14,310
In real life,
you might call it a fling.


529
00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:17,146
Um, brief but very intense.


530
00:22:17,146 --> 00:22:19,686
And... hopeful.


531
00:22:20,955 --> 00:22:23,427
Now, neither of them
had ever been in a relationship


532
00:22:23,428 --> 00:22:25,397
that deep before.


533
00:22:25,396 --> 00:22:28,258
And they told each other that
over and over and over again.


534
00:22:28,258 --> 00:22:30,259
Him more than her,
you know, to the point where


535
00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:32,063
sometimes she was like,
"Chill out," you know.


536
00:22:32,063 --> 00:22:34,770
But anyway,
in a tragic turn of events,


537
00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:39,905
Space Cowboy is wounded,
and he just disappears.


538
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:42,578
Without a trace.


539
00:22:48,114 --> 00:22:49,453
I can keep going.


540
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:51,786
I can hit the rock
better now, thanks.


541
00:22:51,786 --> 00:22:52,952
We're going again!


542
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:57,594
Sound speed.


543
00:22:57,594 --> 00:22:59,386
And action!


544
00:23:02,598 --> 00:23:03,896
-That's a cut!


545
00:23:03,896 --> 00:23:05,533
Cutting there, please.


546
00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:09,640
-Everything okay?
-You good?


547
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,873
For a little more
context, Colt,


548
00:23:11,873 --> 00:23:13,644
Aliena's sort of devastated.


549
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:15,743
And she starts sort of
replaying everything


550
00:23:15,743 --> 00:23:17,108
in her head over and over again.


551
00:23:17,108 --> 00:23:19,206
Did she misread the vibe?


552
00:23:19,209 --> 00:23:20,651
Was it just a fling?


553
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:23,587
Did she let her imagination
run wild again?


554
00:23:23,587 --> 00:23:25,557
Or did he lie to her?


555
00:23:25,557 --> 00:23:27,625
Was he full of shit?


556
00:23:29,595 --> 00:23:30,958
But let me be clear:


557
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:32,993
eventually, Aliena did move on.


558
00:23:32,992 --> 00:23:34,927
All right?


559
00:23:34,928 --> 00:23:37,228
And she started doing Pilates.


560
00:23:37,228 --> 00:23:40,802
Got herself
a banging revenge body,


561
00:23:40,801 --> 00:23:43,002
and then she started dating
other humans.


562
00:23:43,002 --> 00:23:45,104
One after another.


563
00:23:45,104 --> 00:23:47,238
And she had
so many mind-blowing,


564
00:23:47,238 --> 00:23:50,438
far superior experiences,
you wouldn't even believe it.


565
00:23:50,438 --> 00:23:51,781
- Right, girls?
- Yeah.


566
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,442
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah. Yeah.


567
00:23:53,442 --> 00:23:54,750
Yeah, it was like a sushi train.


568
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,412
I'm gonna be sick.


569
00:23:57,412 --> 00:23:59,151
And do you know what?
We're gonna go again, Colt,


570
00:23:59,151 --> 00:24:00,988
'cause there was
a little buzz on that one.


571
00:24:00,988 --> 00:24:02,461
Okay, light him up.


572
00:24:03,487 --> 00:24:05,596
Last one, everybody. Action!


573
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,260
It-It's just feeling
so withheld,


574
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,196
so how 'bout some dialogue?


575
00:24:13,196 --> 00:24:14,604
Yeah, that's all right, Darla.


576
00:24:14,605 --> 00:24:16,299
I'm gonna go
straight to the source.


577
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:19,644
Hey, Colt, if Space Cowboy
had to say something,


578
00:24:19,644 --> 00:24:22,778
if he was forced to say
something, what would he say?


579
00:24:22,778 --> 00:24:24,307
How would he justify


580
00:24:24,307 --> 00:24:26,011
this year she's spent
spinning out over this?


581
00:24:26,011 --> 00:24:27,848
What could he say?
It's a puzzler, isn't it?


582
00:24:27,848 --> 00:24:30,115
- But have you got any thoughts?
- Uh, maybe he could talk...


583
00:24:30,115 --> 00:24:31,557
Nigel, can you, can you
get him a bullhorn?


584
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:33,448
I can't hear him.


585
00:24:33,448 --> 00:24:34,659
Traveling.


586
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:45,327
Come again, Colt.
What was that?


587
00:24:45,327 --> 00:24:47,571
- It's already on.
-  In this movie,


588
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:51,301
do the aliens and the humans
ever talk...


589
00:24:51,301 --> 00:24:52,742
in private?


590
00:24:53,844 --> 00:24:55,745
- No, not really.
- No private conversations?


591
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,306
No, they don't like
doing private.


592
00:24:57,307 --> 00:24:58,650
Like, they like
to keep it very public.


593
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,343
- Very open.
- Oh.


594
00:25:02,347 --> 00:25:06,753
Well, maybe I'll just, uh,
open it up to the group here.


595
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:10,420
Have you ever been in one of
those situations where...


596
00:25:11,696 --> 00:25:13,664
...you want to say something
and it's so important


597
00:25:13,664 --> 00:25:15,391
that you can't mess it up?


598
00:25:15,391 --> 00:25:20,396
So, you think
long and hard about it,


599
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:22,837
and then you realize...


600
00:25:22,837 --> 00:25:24,675
you've already messed it up?


601
00:25:24,675 --> 00:25:29,370
'Cause you've thought
too long and too hard about it?


602
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:32,442
You're...


603
00:25:32,442 --> 00:25:33,948
What's that?


604
00:25:35,115 --> 00:25:37,214
- You want...


605
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:43,221
I had a similar situation


606
00:25:43,221 --> 00:25:45,453
when I fell in love
with my wife's sister.


607
00:25:45,453 --> 00:25:46,927
- Okay. All right. What...
- No.


608
00:25:46,928 --> 00:25:49,260
- No. Okay.


609
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:51,261
Uh...


610
00:25:51,261 --> 00:25:53,769
And again,
this is hard because...


611
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,638
you know, I haven't
read the script.


612
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,136
But...


613
00:25:59,203 --> 00:26:01,271
...he'd probably say...


614
00:26:02,913 --> 00:26:04,979
...that he's been living...


615
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,654
...in total regret since then.


616
00:26:11,086 --> 00:26:12,789
You know, afraid...


617
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:14,724
that he'll never get
an opportunity


618
00:26:14,724 --> 00:26:16,452
to make it up to her...


619
00:26:18,027 --> 00:26:19,555
...because he waited too long.


620
00:26:19,555 --> 00:26:21,161
And...


621
00:26:23,934 --> 00:26:25,801
...she's probably moved on.


622
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:27,298
Uh, sorry, Jody,


623
00:26:27,298 --> 00:26:29,938
speaking of moving on,
we, uh...


624
00:26:31,843 --> 00:26:33,811
One more?


625
00:26:38,608 --> 00:26:40,649
I'd love another chance.


626
00:26:44,218 --> 00:26:46,186
- Roll it, Nigel.
- Let's turn over, please!


627
00:26:46,185 --> 00:26:48,021
- All cameras are rolling.
- Shot's up, sound speeding.


628
00:26:48,021 --> 00:26:49,221
Okay, light him up!


629
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:53,290
Action! Thank you!


630
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,300
Gail?


631
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,942
Gail?


632
00:27:05,942 --> 00:27:08,108
Oh. Coffee.


633
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,514
Mm! You're here.


634
00:27:18,515 --> 00:27:19,857
Oh, no, don't use that.
It's broken.


635
00:27:19,856 --> 00:27:22,452
Eight and a half rolls?


636
00:27:22,452 --> 00:27:25,455
That is a world record!


637
00:27:25,455 --> 00:27:28,391
Thank you so much.


638
00:27:28,392 --> 00:27:31,066
It's better than parking cars,
isn't it?


639
00:27:32,627 --> 00:27:34,561
- Would you cut the shit, Gail?


640
00:27:34,563 --> 00:27:36,708
What? It was amazing.
What are you talking about?


641
00:27:36,708 --> 00:27:39,008
She doesn't want me here, Gail.


642
00:27:39,008 --> 00:27:40,371
Yes, she does.


643
00:27:40,371 --> 00:27:41,978
Oh, of course she does.


644
00:27:41,978 --> 00:27:44,816
- You lied. You lied.
- Oh.


645
00:27:44,816 --> 00:27:46,750
- Colt.
- Do you know how that feels?


646
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,720
I think you deserve
a second chance.


647
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,548
It's, like, the message
in all my movies.


648
00:27:52,548 --> 00:27:54,186
What's the message
in all my movies?


649
00:27:54,186 --> 00:27:56,519
Uh...


650
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:58,796
Nihilism's a viable worldview?


651
00:28:00,426 --> 00:28:03,063
No, that's just
the entertainment.


652
00:28:03,064 --> 00:28:05,067
That's like the...


653
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:06,936
like the sexy bacon.


654
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:08,838
- What is this?
- You know? It's like dogs.


655
00:28:08,838 --> 00:28:11,696
You got to wrap the message...


656
00:28:11,699 --> 00:28:13,634
in some sexy bacon.


657
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,343
I mean, all those movies,
people fall down.


658
00:28:17,343 --> 00:28:19,278
They're rolling
in their own shit.


659
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:21,510
They don't think they can cope,
but they can. They get back up.


660
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,347
Do you mind if I lay down?


661
00:28:23,347 --> 00:28:26,186
With the multiple fire burns
and the cannon rolls


662
00:28:26,186 --> 00:28:28,792
- and the jet lag, I just...
- Yep, yep, yep.


663
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:30,289
...could use a little shut-eye.


664
00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:31,422
Yep.


665
00:28:31,422 --> 00:28:33,062
Okay, let me get this straight.


666
00:28:34,261 --> 00:28:37,230
- Nihilism is the sexy bacon?
- Yeah.


667
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,035
The audience are dogs?


668
00:28:39,035 --> 00:28:40,432
There we go.


669
00:28:40,432 --> 00:28:43,598
And when you fall down,
you get back up.


670
00:28:43,598 --> 00:28:45,466
- Thank you.
- I'm glad we did this.


671
00:28:45,469 --> 00:28:48,604
Now, what am I
really doing here, Gail?


672
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:52,477
Um...


673
00:28:52,477 --> 00:28:53,576
Ryder's missing.


674
00:28:53,576 --> 00:28:55,115
He has fallen in


675
00:28:55,115 --> 00:28:58,317
with some shady,
shitty, shitty people.


676
00:28:58,317 --> 00:29:00,517
Well, Gail...


677
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,125
...call the cops.


678
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:04,489
I can't call the cops.


679
00:29:04,489 --> 00:29:06,062
Well, why not?


680
00:29:06,061 --> 00:29:08,755
The studio will know
that I am way over budget.


681
00:29:08,756 --> 00:29:10,428
They will pull the plug on this.


682
00:29:10,428 --> 00:29:12,937
You know that.


683
00:29:12,936 --> 00:29:14,233
Please go and find him.


684
00:29:14,233 --> 00:29:15,566
Why me?


685
00:29:15,566 --> 00:29:17,600
You're a stuntman,
for God's sake.


686
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:19,766
No one's gonna notice
whether you're here or not.


687
00:29:19,767 --> 00:29:21,636
- No offense.
- I mean, some taken.


688
00:29:21,636 --> 00:29:24,407
You know him intimately.


689
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,114
It can be so simple.


690
00:29:26,114 --> 00:29:28,952
You pick him up,
you dust him off,


691
00:29:28,952 --> 00:29:30,250
you bring him back here.


692
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,856
I know I can trust you.


693
00:29:31,856 --> 00:29:33,517
And you know who can
trust you more than anyone,


694
00:29:33,517 --> 00:29:36,421
she just doesn't
realize it yet, is Jody.


695
00:29:36,421 --> 00:29:39,359
This is her big chance.


696
00:29:39,358 --> 00:29:42,163
Do you want her first movie
to be her last?


697
00:29:42,163 --> 00:29:44,494
You've got to help me out, man.


698
00:29:45,905 --> 00:29:48,500
It's been a long couple days.


699
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,469
I'm gonna go to the hotel,
I'm gonna--


700
00:29:51,469 --> 00:29:54,208
What is it? It's my yesterday,
it's your tomor--


701
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:55,639
I'm gonna call you
your tomorrow.


702
00:29:55,638 --> 00:29:57,375
- Right, no. Today.
- My today.


703
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:59,013
That is the door code
of Ryder's loft.


704
00:29:59,015 --> 00:30:00,951
The patio door.
Took it from his trailer.


705
00:30:00,951 --> 00:30:02,952
He's still doing
this Post-it note thing?


706
00:30:02,952 --> 00:30:05,020
Oh.
Let's not even get into that.


707
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,781
At this point,
it's like Memento level.


708
00:30:07,781 --> 00:30:10,321
I can only keep this
from Jody and the studio


709
00:30:10,323 --> 00:30:12,557
48 hours max.


710
00:30:12,557 --> 00:30:14,130
Save Jody's movie,


711
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:16,660
and maybe you get
the love of your life back.


712
00:30:18,267 --> 00:30:20,827
Did you just turn Jody
into the sexy bacon?


713
00:30:20,827 --> 00:30:23,973
She's been
the sexy bacon all along.


714
00:30:23,973 --> 00:30:25,369
You're good.


715
00:30:25,371 --> 00:30:27,604
It's the only left-hand drive
I have.


716
00:30:29,377 --> 00:30:31,541
Please don't wreck it.
It's product placement.


717
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:34,050
There's only two of them.


718
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:36,282
I know how you stunties drive.


719
00:30:39,386 --> 00:30:42,090

Uh, just, uh, chilling down.


738
00:32:17,648 --> 00:32:19,518
Were you "chilling down"
to Taylor Swift?


739
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,488
- Yep.
- Mm.


740
00:32:21,488 --> 00:32:23,324
It's just something
Australians say.


741
00:32:23,324 --> 00:32:24,755
Really? I've been here for six
months, I've never heard it.


742
00:32:24,755 --> 00:32:26,196
Yeah, "chilling down under,"
you know,


743
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:27,525
but it's shorter to say
"chilling down."


744
00:32:27,526 --> 00:32:29,692
- Have you been crying?
- Not at all.


745
00:32:29,692 --> 00:32:31,233
You look like
you've been crying.


746
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,697
Jet lag.


747
00:32:34,698 --> 00:32:37,634
That was so dangerous,
and I'm very sorry.


748
00:32:37,634 --> 00:32:39,702
Lighting you up like that.


749
00:32:39,702 --> 00:32:42,113
It was very cathartic.


750
00:32:42,113 --> 00:32:44,246
- I feel better.
- I deserved it.


751
00:32:46,645 --> 00:32:49,811
I'm gonna make the camera
up to you, by the way.


752
00:32:49,811 --> 00:32:52,056
Can I get in the car with you?


753
00:32:54,259 --> 00:32:56,489
Clean your face. You're a mess.


754
00:32:59,824 --> 00:33:01,230
So how have you been?


755
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:03,661
Oh, you know.


756
00:33:05,336 --> 00:33:06,828
Yeah? Thumbs-up?


757
00:33:06,828 --> 00:33:09,701
God, I hate that bullshit,
that stunt guy bullshit.


758
00:33:11,109 --> 00:33:12,306
- And that's fine.


759
00:33:12,307 --> 00:33:13,671
You don't have to
explain anything.


760
00:33:13,671 --> 00:33:15,475
It's all good. It was a fling.


761
00:33:15,474 --> 00:33:17,576
Less than a fling. It was
a flingette, and that's fine.


762
00:33:17,576 --> 00:33:19,380
I don't even want to know.


763
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,844
And the problem with forcing
something is you get nowhere.


764
00:33:21,844 --> 00:33:23,682
You know, one time my mom
forced my dad to exercise.


765
00:33:23,682 --> 00:33:25,485
Do you know what happened?


766
00:33:25,484 --> 00:33:27,388
Snapped his ankle first time
he stepped on the treadmill.


767
00:33:27,388 --> 00:33:29,983
She forced it, now he has
a piece of metal in his foot.


768
00:33:29,983 --> 00:33:32,195
Moral of the story is
you should just be you.


769
00:33:34,958 --> 00:33:36,926
Well, look, I've thought
a lot about this, actually,


770
00:33:36,925 --> 00:33:38,398
and I, uh...


771
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,697
It's not like
I didn't want to apologize


772
00:33:39,696 --> 00:33:41,698
a million times.


773
00:33:41,699 --> 00:33:42,865
Yeah.


774
00:33:42,865 --> 00:33:45,405
Uh, it's just, every time I...


775
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:51,709
You know, when I think of
something to say...


776
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:56,615
...doesn't seem like enough.


777
00:34:01,885 --> 00:34:03,523
Okay.


778
00:34:03,523 --> 00:34:05,359
No problem.


779
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:08,297
Boundaries. Boundaries.


780
00:34:08,297 --> 00:34:09,627
That's important.


781
00:34:09,628 --> 00:34:11,432
Because I have
a lot of pressure on me.


782
00:34:11,432 --> 00:34:15,304
You have no idea how hard it was
for me to make this movie, okay?


783
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:17,405
I just need to focus,
so if you're gonna stay here,


784
00:34:17,405 --> 00:34:19,704
we need to keep it...


785
00:34:19,704 --> 00:34:21,177
like, super profesh.


786
00:34:22,248 --> 00:34:23,576
"Professional"
is my middle name.


787
00:34:23,576 --> 00:34:25,512
Mm-hmm.


788
00:34:27,483 --> 00:34:29,043
I thought your middle name
was "Danger."


789
00:34:29,043 --> 00:34:31,750
That's a stage name.


790
00:34:33,786 --> 00:34:35,819
Colt Profesh Seavers.


791
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:43,090
Promise me you're not
gonna derail this, okay?


792
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,596
Promise.


793
00:34:46,304 --> 00:34:49,338
Okay.


794
00:34:53,773 --> 00:34:55,708
Want to do some doughnuts?


795
00:35:04,454 --> 00:35:07,257
Do you want to drive me
to my car?


796
00:35:07,257 --> 00:35:08,819
- Yeah.


797
00:35:19,733 --> 00:35:21,304

I'm Iggy Starr,
lead actress on Metalstorm.

- I'm Ryder's girlfriend.
- Oh.


856
00:38:45,233 --> 00:38:46,740
- You're in Metalstorm.
- Yeah.


857
00:38:46,739 --> 00:38:48,203
Hey, were you
in that movie Carjacked


858
00:38:48,204 --> 00:38:49,677
where that guy named Jack
steals your car


859
00:38:49,677 --> 00:38:51,009
and then you shoot him
in the hand and you say,


860
00:38:51,009 --> 00:38:52,384
"I hope you know
how to drive stick"?


861
00:38:52,384 --> 00:38:54,077
And it doesn't make sense
'cause it's like,


862
00:38:54,077 --> 00:38:55,849
should be "automatic,"
but the way you say it...


863
00:38:55,849 --> 00:38:57,355
That's Naomi Watts!


864
00:39:03,019 --> 00:39:04,219
I'm just a stunt guy.


865
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:06,221
I'm working on Metalstorm, too.


866
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:09,224
You lie!
We're only on Metalstorm 1.


867
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:11,061
- I meant also!


868
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:30,750
Is this a prop sword?


869
00:39:30,751 --> 00:39:33,458
Mm-hmm. I'm a good actress.


870
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:36,625
Hey, if you are
really working on Metalstorm,


871
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:38,121
why are you
sneaking around here?


872
00:39:38,121 --> 00:39:40,057
Just trying to find Ryder.


873
00:39:40,057 --> 00:39:42,532
He's, like, really drugged up
and paranoid right now.


874
00:39:42,532 --> 00:39:44,358
He thinks someone's
trying to kill him.


875
00:39:44,358 --> 00:39:47,262
And I'm like, "If you don't
finish Metalstorm,


876
00:39:47,262 --> 00:39:49,769
I'm gonna kill you myself."


877
00:39:49,769 --> 00:39:51,969
Now, there is
some dark shit going on.


878
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:54,301
And the sooner I can get
out of here, the better.


879
00:39:55,844 --> 00:39:57,778
Wow.


880
00:39:57,778 --> 00:39:59,648
Any idea where I could find him?


881
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:02,487
Uh, you could try this club
he hangs out at.


882
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:05,280
But you're never gonna get in
looking like a povo.


883
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,952
- What's a povo?
- A poor person like you.


884
00:40:07,954 --> 00:40:09,989
Oh. Cool.


885
00:40:09,989 --> 00:40:13,155
What's with your
Miami Vice Stunt Team jacket?


886
00:40:13,155 --> 00:40:14,795
Oh, it was
the first show I ever did.


887
00:40:14,795 --> 00:40:18,228
I had to jump a boat
through a ring of fire.


888
00:40:18,228 --> 00:40:19,635
I got so good I could do it


889
00:40:19,635 --> 00:40:20,934
with my hands
tied behind my back.


890
00:40:22,431 --> 00:40:23,606
Wow.


891
00:40:23,606 --> 00:40:25,433
You're really into yourself.


892
00:40:27,103 --> 00:40:29,072
I mean, you know, you did ask.


893
00:40:29,072 --> 00:40:30,744
It's neon night at the club.


894
00:40:30,746 --> 00:40:32,143
He's always there
with this guy called Doone


895
00:40:32,143 --> 00:40:33,749
who's his drug dealer.


896
00:40:33,748 --> 00:40:35,342
He's got, like,
leopard print tats on his head.


897
00:40:35,342 --> 00:40:37,851
They won't let a nobody
like you into the club,


898
00:40:37,851 --> 00:40:39,788
so just act like Tom.
You're his stunt double.


899
00:40:39,788 --> 00:40:41,416
You know how to do that,
don't you?


900
00:40:41,416 --> 00:40:43,251
Yeah. I'll just act like
I own everything and everyone


901
00:40:43,251 --> 00:40:45,528
and there's no repercussions
for my actions.


902
00:40:47,454 --> 00:40:49,632
♪ I do it like that... ♪


903
00:40:50,996 --> 00:40:53,932
Oh, my God. Is that Tom Ryder?


904
00:40:53,934 --> 00:40:55,198
Hey, Tom!


905
00:40:57,266 --> 00:40:59,333
Stuntman! Yeah, yeah, Iggy said
you were gonna come see me.


906
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:00,840
Yeah, sit down, get a drink.


907
00:41:00,842 --> 00:41:01,974
Hey, hey, get him a drink.
What do you want?


908
00:41:01,974 --> 00:41:03,436
Oh, no, no, I'm good. I'm good.


909
00:41:03,436 --> 00:41:05,481
I'm just looking for Ryder.
You seen him?


910
00:41:06,916 --> 00:41:09,114
Get him a Shirley Temple.
Sit down, brother, sit down.


911
00:41:09,114 --> 00:41:11,445
Uh, honestly, no offense,
Mr. Doone.


912
00:41:11,445 --> 00:41:13,315
I just want to find Ryder.


913
00:41:13,315 --> 00:41:16,251
How come no one ever wants
to chat with the drug dealer?


914
00:41:19,422 --> 00:41:21,960
Sorry. I, uh...


915
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,490
I mean no... no disrespect.


916
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,492
Just had a long day.
Ryder hasn't shown up to work.


917
00:41:26,492 --> 00:41:28,164
That was fast.


918
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:29,639
You do a stunt today?


919
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:31,235
Uh, just a, yeah, car roll.


920
00:41:31,235 --> 00:41:32,740
- Just a car roll?


921
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,007
Hear how he said that?
"Just a car roll!"


922
00:41:35,007 --> 00:41:36,909
What a stuntman! My man!


923
00:41:36,909 --> 00:41:38,681
It's what I do.


924
00:41:38,681 --> 00:41:39,847
Hey, that's why I like you.


925
00:41:39,847 --> 00:41:41,409
'Cause you do all the hard shit.


926
00:41:41,409 --> 00:41:44,017
They give Oscars for that?


927
00:41:44,016 --> 00:41:45,918
For stunts?


928
00:41:45,918 --> 00:41:47,722
No.


929
00:41:47,724 --> 00:41:49,153
Nope.


930
00:41:49,153 --> 00:41:51,320
Hey, to the unsung heroes.


931
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,125
- I'll drink to that.
-  Yeah.


932
00:41:55,228 --> 00:41:56,996
Mm!


933
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,030
No offense,
but I prefer cartoons.


934
00:42:00,032 --> 00:42:02,871
See, movies are always trying
to make things real.


935
00:42:02,871 --> 00:42:04,675
But it's not real.
It's a movie.


936
00:42:04,675 --> 00:42:06,533
It's not meant to be real.


937
00:42:06,532 --> 00:42:08,269
- That's why I like cartoons.


938
00:42:08,271 --> 00:42:09,537
See, 'cause cartoons


939
00:42:09,536 --> 00:42:10,779
don't pretend to be real.


940
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,409
That's what I like about them.
You seen Dumbo?


941
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:15,949
- Dumbo?
- Yeah, Dumbo.


942
00:42:15,949 --> 00:42:17,853
Dumbo changed my life.


943
00:42:17,853 --> 00:42:20,085
You know that scene when Dumbo
gets into the bad champagne,


944
00:42:20,085 --> 00:42:21,416
then he starts seeing
the pink elephants


945
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:22,417
on parade and shit?


946
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:23,626
I was like, "Yes, please.


947
00:42:23,626 --> 00:42:25,090
"I'll have what he's having!


948
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:26,519
Make it a double!"


949
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:29,601
Hey, stuntman?


950
00:42:29,601 --> 00:42:31,294
- Why don't you come with us?


951
00:42:31,293 --> 00:42:33,737
We'll get you nice and
comfortable at the hotel, huh?


952
00:43:19,211 --> 00:43:22,213
Move, move! Get out of the way!
Get-- Move! Come on!


953
00:43:23,547 --> 00:43:26,250
Get out the way!
Move! Get off me!


954
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:27,516
Hey!


955
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,422
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Taxi! Come on, come on.


956
00:43:33,422 --> 00:43:34,830
Come on, brother, let's go.


957
00:43:34,831 --> 00:43:37,163
- Go! -See you, mate.
- Be well, mate.


958
00:43:47,306 --> 00:43:48,976
What are you doing, Colt?


959
00:43:48,976 --> 00:43:51,472
You know what I'm doing.
I'm gonna stop this car.


960
00:43:51,474 --> 00:43:54,278
You're clearly high, Colt.
And you're clearly chickenshit!


961
00:43:54,278 --> 00:43:56,346
Okay, we don't have time for
this. Talk about this later.


962
00:44:05,289 --> 00:44:06,994
Yeah, okay. -DOONE:
Driver, what are you doing?


963
00:44:06,994 --> 00:44:09,291
Drive! Drive, bro!


964
00:44:09,293 --> 00:44:11,164
Listen. Hey, you need to chill.
Just relax. Just re--


965
00:44:11,164 --> 00:44:12,968
Hey, just relax! I'm a lover,
not a fighter, okay? Just...


966
00:44:12,967 --> 00:44:14,199
- Where's Ryder?!
- I just drugged you


967
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:15,333
'cause they paid me to.


968
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:16,806
- Who's "they"?


969
00:44:16,806 --> 00:44:18,467
The guy that runs
Ryder's security.


970
00:44:18,467 --> 00:44:19,742
I deliver drugs to him


971
00:44:19,742 --> 00:44:21,239
at the Pendleton Hotel
sometimes, okay?


972
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:22,175
- What room?
- Bro, I don't know what room.


973
00:44:22,175 --> 00:44:23,715
You know, it changes.


974
00:44:23,715 --> 00:44:24,914
Just ask Kevin
for the, for the fruit plate.


975
00:44:24,914 --> 00:44:26,476
- He'll give you the key.
- Kevin?


976
00:44:26,476 --> 00:44:27,916
- Kevin! K-E-V-I-N. For the...
- I know Kevin!


977
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:28,983
You know Kevin?


978
00:44:28,983 --> 00:44:30,479
I don't know Kevin.


979
00:44:30,478 --> 00:44:32,085
Well, then you're gonna
get to know Kevin.


980
00:44:32,085 --> 00:44:35,186
Ask him for a fruit plate,
and he'll give you keys.


981
00:44:35,186 --> 00:44:36,650
How long does this last?


982
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:38,190
- What?
- How long is this gonna last?


983
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:39,322
Bro, what are you even saying?


984
00:44:39,322 --> 00:44:42,259
How... long does this last?


985
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:45,099
Oh. When you stop
seeing unicorns.


986
00:44:49,563 --> 00:44:52,237
I'd like to speak to Kevin.


987
00:44:52,237 --> 00:44:54,501
Kevin's, uh, on a break.


988
00:44:54,503 --> 00:44:57,914
Okay, maybe you can help me.
Can I order the "fruit plate"?


989
00:44:57,914 --> 00:45:01,785
Okay. Do you want me
to call "room service"?


990
00:45:01,784 --> 00:45:03,675
I don't know.
Is that what happens?


991
00:45:03,677 --> 00:45:04,887
D-Do you have a room?


992
00:45:04,887 --> 00:45:06,384
- Should I just...
- Do I need one?


993
00:45:06,384 --> 00:45:07,681
To order the fr...


994
00:45:07,681 --> 00:45:08,791
- I...
- The fruit plate.


995
00:45:08,791 --> 00:45:09,826
- Hey, Colt.
- Fruit plate.


996
00:45:10,829 --> 00:45:11,894
Woof, wow.


997
00:45:11,894 --> 00:45:13,961
- That's a look.
- Hi. Hey.


998
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,293
- What happened to your face?
- Hi.


999
00:45:15,293 --> 00:45:16,865
- Hi. Okay.


1000
00:45:16,865 --> 00:45:18,362
- Sorry about that.
- Are you good?


1001
00:45:18,362 --> 00:45:19,869
- It's just good...
- What's wrong with you?


1002
00:45:19,869 --> 00:45:20,769
- It's good to see you.
- Wow, you look terrible.


1003
00:45:20,771 --> 00:45:22,103
You look amazing.


1004
00:45:22,103 --> 00:45:23,565
Did you fall?
What happened to you?


1005
00:45:23,565 --> 00:45:25,269
Wow. You're so pretty.


1006
00:45:25,269 --> 00:45:26,634
-  It's crazy.
- Okay. Your face is bleeding.


1007
00:45:26,635 --> 00:45:28,604
- What?
- What happened to you?


1008
00:45:28,603 --> 00:45:30,637
Oh. No, I was running.
Just-- I was running.


1009
00:45:30,637 --> 00:45:32,947
Very unusual athleisure wear
for a run.


1010
00:45:32,947 --> 00:45:34,576
-  This?
- Yeah.


1011
00:45:34,576 --> 00:45:37,117
Yeah, they gave me
the wrong bags at the airport,


1012
00:45:37,117 --> 00:45:38,448
but, you know, it's-- it works.


1013
00:45:38,447 --> 00:45:39,954
I can sweat.


1014
00:45:39,956 --> 00:45:41,451
If I'm gonna play Ryder,
I thought I should just,


1015
00:45:41,451 --> 00:45:42,793
like, cut weight a little,
you know...


1016
00:45:42,793 --> 00:45:43,959
You seem kind of tweaky.


1017
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:46,554
I'm a little... spotty.


1018
00:45:46,554 --> 00:45:49,228
Like, when I--
my glucose levels get low.


1019
00:45:49,228 --> 00:45:50,899
I get a little...


1020
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:53,760
- Okay, is that a new thing?


1021
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,301
Is that a new thing?


1022
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,597
- What's that?
- Is that a new thing?


1023
00:45:56,599 --> 00:45:58,269
- Is your hair new?
- Yes, I cut it.


1024
00:45:58,269 --> 00:45:59,634
- I changed my hair.
- It's beautiful.


1025
00:45:59,635 --> 00:46:01,142
You changed your number.
We're even.


1026
00:46:01,141 --> 00:46:03,506
I thought we'd sort of
even the score.


1027
00:46:03,507 --> 00:46:05,409
Yeah. I have a lot of new s--


1028
00:46:05,409 --> 00:46:06,949
You know, I've learned
a lot about myself


1029
00:46:06,949 --> 00:46:09,115
since-since we last
seen each other.


1030
00:46:09,115 --> 00:46:10,853
Why'd you disappear like that?


1031
00:46:10,853 --> 00:46:13,053
God, I wanted
to be there for you.


1032
00:46:14,552 --> 00:46:16,652
Yeah, but how's
she supposed to do quality work


1033
00:46:16,652 --> 00:46:18,092
if you keep harassing her
all the time?


1034
00:46:20,425 --> 00:46:22,492
Okay. Can you go
and grab your things?


1035
00:46:22,492 --> 00:46:24,835
- We have really got to zip.
- Okay. Yep.


1036
00:46:24,835 --> 00:46:26,199
- What's going on?
- Seriously.


1037
00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:29,003
- Colt, you're...


1038
00:46:29,003 --> 00:46:30,367
You look like you've been busy.


1039
00:46:30,367 --> 00:46:32,634
- Yeah, real busy, Gail.
- Yeah, good.


1040
00:46:32,635 --> 00:46:33,844
Lot of running around, Gail.


1041
00:46:33,844 --> 00:46:35,769
We'll get a drink
and discuss that.


1042
00:46:35,769 --> 00:46:37,309
But right now, the studio...


1043
00:46:37,309 --> 00:46:39,541
so far up my ass,
I can taste them.


1044
00:46:39,541 --> 00:46:41,114
- We need your third act.
- Okay. Yep.


1045
00:46:41,114 --> 00:46:42,709
You having problems
with the third act?


1046
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:44,447
We're gonna, we're gonna go
and do things right now.


1047
00:46:44,447 --> 00:46:45,855
I need to write it.
I'm gonna go write it. I just--


1048
00:46:45,856 --> 00:46:47,551
It's like
the studio are wanting me


1049
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:49,958
to contort the love story
so that it all ends happily


1050
00:46:49,958 --> 00:46:51,355
and everything's rosy and...


1051
00:46:51,356 --> 00:46:52,896
- Jody, Jody, Jody.
- But I feel like if I...


1052
00:46:52,896 --> 00:46:56,295
lean into reality,
then maybe that's the way to go.


1053
00:46:56,295 --> 00:46:59,068
And most love stories
don't end well. Usually.


1054
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,730
- Know what I mean?
- I strongly disagree with that,


1055
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:05,501
so we should keep
chopping it up.


1056
00:47:05,501 --> 00:47:06,735
Yeah? Should we?


1057
00:47:06,735 --> 00:47:08,913
It's important.
It's the ending.


1058
00:47:08,913 --> 00:47:10,572
- Okay.


1059
00:47:12,376 --> 00:47:14,083
Sir?


1060
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:15,414
- Huh?
- Hi.


1061
00:47:15,414 --> 00:47:16,678
- Yeah.
- Hi.


1062
00:47:16,677 --> 00:47:18,679
Um, I hear that
you're interested


1063
00:47:18,679 --> 00:47:20,518
in a-a fruit platter.


1064
00:47:20,518 --> 00:47:21,990
-  Kevin?
-  Yes.


1065
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:23,387
Yes. Okay, so...


1066
00:47:24,489 --> 00:47:26,896
It's-it's on... it's on ice.


1067
00:47:47,413 --> 00:47:49,744
Yep. There we go. Sorry.


1068
00:48:35,166 --> 00:48:36,824
Hello?


1069
00:48:36,824 --> 00:48:38,331
What do you
think about split screen?


1070
00:48:38,331 --> 00:48:40,398
- Jody?
- Yeah.


1071
00:48:40,398 --> 00:48:42,762
Is this okay I'm calling?
You said to call and...


1072
00:48:42,764 --> 00:48:45,173
- Yes. Yeah, it's fine.
- Yeah? We could chop it up?


1073
00:48:45,173 --> 00:48:47,240
It's, uh... Let's chop it up.


1074
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,637
It's a good time.
I'm not doing anything.


1075
00:48:48,637 --> 00:48:51,773
Okay. Great.
Uh, so, split screen, right?


1076
00:48:51,773 --> 00:48:53,907
Do you think that it's,
like, nostalgic super cool


1077
00:48:53,907 --> 00:48:56,481
or do you think
it's a gimmick? -


1078
00:48:56,481 --> 00:48:59,287
Um, I think
it could be super cool.


1079
00:48:59,286 --> 00:49:02,091
Mm-hmm? -Yeah, how do you,
uh, want to use it?


1080
00:49:02,092 --> 00:49:04,489
I mean, you know, tell me.
Tell me everything.


1081
00:49:04,489 --> 00:49:06,755
Tell me, you know,
about your vision.


1082
00:49:06,755 --> 00:49:08,690
So, I like that
they're on-screen together.


1083
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:10,428
But they are in
separate worlds... -Right.


1084
00:49:10,429 --> 00:49:12,530
...you know,
visually and emotionally.


1085
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:14,762
So you've got
this very prominent divide


1086
00:49:14,762 --> 00:49:16,204
between the lovers.


1087
00:49:16,204 --> 00:49:17,666
And I want that.


1088
00:49:20,804 --> 00:49:23,409
- You want the divide?
- I want the divide, yes.


1089
00:49:26,083 --> 00:49:27,710
Hmm.


1090
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:29,349
It's funny 'cause I-I didn't
get the impression


1091
00:49:29,349 --> 00:49:31,384
that there was that much
keeping them apart.


1092
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,486
Well, you haven't
read the script.


1093
00:49:34,983 --> 00:49:37,193
All I know so far is that
the alien lady and the cowboy


1094
00:49:37,193 --> 00:49:41,493
are having what seem to be
pretty manageable problems.


1095
00:49:41,492 --> 00:49:44,298
Jody? Jod-- How's this?


1096
00:49:44,298 --> 00:49:45,893
Manageable problems?


1097
00:49:45,893 --> 00:49:47,994
The aliens invaded Earth,
and they left it in tatters.


1098
00:49:47,994 --> 00:49:49,664
So this whole thing
the studio are pushing for,


1099
00:49:49,666 --> 00:49:51,074
the "love conquers all"
thing...


1100
00:49:51,074 --> 00:49:53,704
I'm not buying it.


1101
00:49:53,704 --> 00:49:56,970
Well, I have to admit that I'm
surprised to hear you say that.


1102
00:49:56,969 --> 00:49:58,807
Why?


1103
00:49:58,807 --> 00:50:01,250
Well, I'm just
a boy in a neon suit


1104
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:03,217
standing in front of a girl,
reminding her


1105
00:50:03,217 --> 00:50:05,581
that Notting Hill
is her favorite movie


1106
00:50:05,583 --> 00:50:08,818
and she watches Love Actually
every year at Christmas.


1107
00:50:08,818 --> 00:50:10,555
Well, you know,
I watched it again this year,


1108
00:50:10,554 --> 00:50:13,260
and I didn't love it, actually.


1109
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,099
- Wow, it's worse than I thought.
- Yeah, I'm ruined.


1110
00:50:15,099 --> 00:50:17,266
Yeah, it's a really sad day
for Notting Hill as well.


1111
00:50:17,266 --> 00:50:19,432
That "happily ever after"
stuff, unsubscribe me.


1112
00:50:19,432 --> 00:50:21,103
I didn't get "happily ever
after" from Notting Hill.


1113
00:50:21,103 --> 00:50:22,567
What are you talking about?
Of course you did.


1114
00:50:22,568 --> 00:50:24,405
- Did you?
- Yes, of course. They're ly--


1115
00:50:24,405 --> 00:50:26,208
They're on the park bench.
She's got her head in his knee.


1116
00:50:26,208 --> 00:50:27,407
She's a "regular girl."


1117
00:50:27,407 --> 00:50:28,937
Maybe, but we don't know
for sure


1118
00:50:28,936 --> 00:50:31,411
she's not gonna go back
to working the street.


1119
00:50:31,411 --> 00:50:32,939
All we know is that
in the beginning,


1120
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:34,778
she's pretty much up for
anything but kissing,


1121
00:50:34,777 --> 00:50:36,415
and in the end,
she's open to kissing him.


1122
00:50:36,416 --> 00:50:38,518
-  No. No.
- And it gives us hope.


1123
00:50:38,518 --> 00:50:40,012
You have got your Julia Roberts
movies so twisted.


1124
00:50:40,012 --> 00:50:41,257
And that's all we want.
A little hope.


1125
00:50:41,257 --> 00:50:42,586
No, that is Pretty Woman,


1126
00:50:42,586 --> 00:50:43,853
where she is
a lady of the night,


1127
00:50:43,853 --> 00:50:45,195
and this is Notting Hill,


1128
00:50:45,195 --> 00:50:46,260
where she's
a very famous actress.


1129
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,757
Oh. Well, don't listen to me.


1130
00:50:47,757 --> 00:50:49,891
What do I know?
Look, you're the director.


1131
00:50:49,891 --> 00:50:51,232
You're gonna make
the right choice.


1132
00:50:51,233 --> 00:50:53,135
I'm just saying,
for people like me,


1133
00:50:53,135 --> 00:50:54,961
who may not necessarily get the
metaphor of the split screen.


1134
00:50:54,961 --> 00:50:56,733
You may not get
the deeper metaphor,


1135
00:50:56,733 --> 00:50:58,240
but you're gonna see it.


1136
00:50:58,239 --> 00:50:59,934
You're gonna see
this bright line between them


1137
00:50:59,934 --> 00:51:02,903
that we're gonna ache
to see blur.


1138
00:51:02,905 --> 00:51:04,708
You know, but maybe it can't.


1139
00:51:04,708 --> 00:51:07,041
- Mm.
- Maybe it doesn't.


1140
00:51:07,041 --> 00:51:09,780
Right. Right. Yeah.


1141
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:13,617
But what do we know, right?


1142
00:51:13,617 --> 00:51:15,257
'Cause all we know at this point


1143
00:51:15,257 --> 00:51:17,951
is that the cowboy
likes the alien.


1144
00:51:17,952 --> 00:51:19,394
Does the alien like the cowboy?


1145
00:51:19,393 --> 00:51:21,296
She's on the fence.


1146
00:51:21,297 --> 00:51:22,561
Right.


1147
00:51:22,561 --> 00:51:24,596
Because they got problems.


1148
00:51:24,596 --> 00:51:29,139
Because she's an alien and he's
a cowboy, and that's a problem.


1149
00:51:29,139 --> 00:51:30,768
But is it a problem
they can't overcome?


1150
00:51:30,768 --> 00:51:32,405
Here's a question.


1151
00:51:32,405 --> 00:51:35,244
Are they even gonna try?


1152
00:51:35,244 --> 00:51:36,771
What do you think?


1153
00:51:38,007 --> 00:51:40,040
Do you think they're gonna try?


1154
00:51:41,449 --> 00:51:43,812
I think...


1155
00:51:45,289 --> 00:51:47,355
I think this was
a great brainstorm.


1156
00:51:50,822 --> 00:51:53,262
So...


1157
00:51:53,262 --> 00:51:55,792
what'd you decide
about the split screen?


1158
00:51:55,791 --> 00:51:57,628
I have a better idea.


1159
00:51:59,092 --> 00:52:00,927
I don't think you need it.


1160
00:52:00,929 --> 00:52:03,470
I think the connection between
these characters is so strong


1161
00:52:03,469 --> 00:52:05,571
that nothing can
come between them.


1162
00:52:06,969 --> 00:52:08,509
Jod?


1163
00:52:09,875 --> 00:52:11,039
Jody?


1164
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:36,899
-Hello?
- Dead guy on ice.


1165
00:52:36,898 --> 00:52:38,538
What?


1166
00:52:38,539 --> 00:52:42,211
There's a dead guy on ice
at the hotel, Gail.


1167
00:52:42,211 --> 00:52:44,039
Wait. Sorry.
What are you talking about?


1168
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:45,381
Well, if you think
that doesn't make sense,


1169
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,315
- don't order the fruit plate.
- Hold on.


1170
00:52:47,315 --> 00:52:49,143
You're seriously telling me
you've just seen a dead body?


1171
00:52:49,143 --> 00:52:50,847
Yes, Gail.


1172
00:52:50,847 --> 00:52:53,422
On the rocks. In the hotel.


1173
00:52:53,422 --> 00:52:54,686
What hotel?


1174
00:52:54,686 --> 00:52:56,655
The one
I just saw you in, Gail!


1175
00:52:56,655 --> 00:52:58,228
He was so dead, Gail.


1176
00:52:58,228 --> 00:53:00,329
He was very dead. Super dead.


1177
00:53:00,329 --> 00:53:01,759
Hold on.
How did you even get there?


1178
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,157
Gail, you asked me
to do this! Okay?


1179
00:53:04,157 --> 00:53:06,698
- So please try and keep up.
- I know. I'm sticking.


1180
00:53:06,697 --> 00:53:09,338
I went to Ryder's apartment
just like you told me.


1181
00:53:09,338 --> 00:53:11,737
That's where Iggy with
the sword gave me the neon suit


1182
00:53:11,737 --> 00:53:14,376
and they sent me to the man
with the leopard print head.


1183
00:53:14,376 --> 00:53:16,280
He goes by the name of Doone.


1184
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,172
It was Doone's goons
who dirtied my Shirley,


1185
00:53:18,172 --> 00:53:19,943
and not in a fun way, Gail.


1186
00:53:19,943 --> 00:53:22,208
I think they were
trying to kill me, Gail!


1187
00:53:22,208 --> 00:53:24,385
Step away and calm down.


1188
00:53:24,385 --> 00:53:26,047
I am gonna handle everything.


1189
00:53:26,047 --> 00:53:27,520
- No more handling!


1190
00:53:27,521 --> 00:53:29,392
- I want the police!
- You're very aggressive.


1191
00:53:29,391 --> 00:53:31,756
I'm sorry. I'm sorry to yell.
I want the police.


1192
00:53:31,757 --> 00:53:33,461
You are not gonna talk
to the police.


1193
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,924
You don't talk to anyone
about this, okay? -


1194
00:53:34,925 --> 00:53:36,222
- You listen to me.
- I'm calling the police.


1195
00:53:36,222 --> 00:53:37,597
You are not
talking to the police.


1196
00:53:37,597 --> 00:53:39,093
- Excuse me, sir.
-Wait, who's there?


1197
00:53:39,092 --> 00:53:40,434
Who's there? Who's there?


1198
00:53:40,436 --> 00:53:41,767
It's the police.
I'm gonna talk to them.


1199
00:53:41,766 --> 00:53:42,998
No, no, no, no, no!
Don't talk...


1200
00:53:45,135 --> 00:53:47,970
No parking at any time.


1201
00:53:51,943 --> 00:53:54,108
Sorry.


1202
00:53:54,108 --> 00:53:55,483
Just making sure
we're both here.


1203
00:53:56,454 --> 00:53:57,552
I'm-I'm here, mate.


1204
00:53:57,552 --> 00:53:59,454
I want to report a crime.


1205
00:53:59,454 --> 00:54:01,083
- Okay.
- An ice crime.


1206
00:54:07,219 --> 00:54:09,893
Yeah. You're still
getting a ticket, mate.


1207
00:54:09,893 --> 00:54:11,268
All right.


1208
00:54:14,833 --> 00:54:16,228
I got to tell Jody.


1209
00:54:16,228 --> 00:54:17,571
About the dead guy.


1210
00:54:17,572 --> 00:54:18,836
How do you know he was dead?


1211
00:54:18,835 --> 00:54:20,266
He could've just been
knocked out.


1212
00:54:20,266 --> 00:54:21,674
- On ice?
- Yeah.


1213
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:24,777
Ice baths are very good
for inflammation.


1214
00:54:24,777 --> 00:54:27,108
And are you forgetting
that you were high?


1215
00:54:27,108 --> 00:54:28,780
How can I if you keep fixating


1216
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:30,112
- on that one point?
- Okay, you know what,


1217
00:54:30,112 --> 00:54:31,684
let me just stop you
right there.


1218
00:54:31,684 --> 00:54:33,489
Whatever you told Jody
last night


1219
00:54:33,489 --> 00:54:34,951
- has got her all fired up.
- I don't know what I said.


1220
00:54:34,951 --> 00:54:36,360
About what?


1221
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,625
And now I have to build a truck


1222
00:54:37,625 --> 00:54:39,989
- for a 250-foot jump.
- Huh?


1223
00:54:39,989 --> 00:54:41,925
- In a day and a half!
- Sounds pretty cool, actually.


1224
00:54:41,925 --> 00:54:44,157
And on top of that,
the fight scene today,


1225
00:54:44,157 --> 00:54:46,864
Jody has decided that she wants
to do it all in one take.


1226
00:54:46,864 --> 00:54:49,130
A oner. -JODY: Dan, did you
tell him about the oner?


1227
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:50,438
- Yes.
- So cool.


1228
00:54:50,438 --> 00:54:51,637
- Right?
- Yeah.


1229
00:54:51,637 --> 00:54:53,298
- So good. He's into it.
- Hi.


1230
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:54,971
Hey. Yeah, can I talk to you
for a second? -Okay,


1231
00:54:54,971 --> 00:54:57,612
about this sequence today,
Ryder's a no-show. -Yeah.


1232
00:54:57,612 --> 00:54:59,009
Again, he's probably on
a bender or something.


1233
00:54:59,009 --> 00:55:00,108
Well, it's interesting
you say that,


1234
00:55:00,108 --> 00:55:01,846
- because that's...
- Yeah.


1235
00:55:01,846 --> 00:55:03,782
...that's what I want to talk
to you about. -Me, too.


1236
00:55:03,782 --> 00:55:05,620
Me, too. Because we don't even
need him. -He...


1237
00:55:05,619 --> 00:55:07,146
Well... -We don't need him.
I had an epiphany last night.


1238
00:55:07,148 --> 00:55:08,392
Let me just tell you.


1239
00:55:08,391 --> 00:55:09,986
- Last night?
- I was so excited.


1240
00:55:09,987 --> 00:55:12,394
Yeah. -After we spoke,
it all came to me.


1241
00:55:12,394 --> 00:55:14,221
Really? -Yeah,
the third act, this sequence,


1242
00:55:14,221 --> 00:55:16,157
- all of it. I've been s...
- After talking to me?


1243
00:55:16,157 --> 00:55:17,565
Yeah. You know, I was shocked


1244
00:55:17,565 --> 00:55:19,061
- when you showed up. Right?
- Yeah.


1245
00:55:19,061 --> 00:55:21,568
- But...
- Well, it was... shocking.


1246
00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:23,506
But I just started to wonder
if maybe


1247
00:55:23,505 --> 00:55:25,407
you showed up
just at the right time, and...


1248
00:55:25,407 --> 00:55:27,574
I've been going for this thing
in the action,


1249
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:29,071
and I've never been able
to get it.


1250
00:55:29,072 --> 00:55:31,843
Like, this feeling
of the pursuit of love.


1251
00:55:31,842 --> 00:55:34,878
And how far would you go for
the one that you love and...


1252
00:55:34,878 --> 00:55:37,684
-You know?
And then...


1253
00:55:37,684 --> 00:55:39,751
Yeah. -You know, I realize
it's not very far with Ryder,


1254
00:55:39,751 --> 00:55:41,182
- 'cause he's a drip.
- Right.


1255
00:55:41,182 --> 00:55:42,822
- And he runs weird.
- Right.


1256
00:55:42,822 --> 00:55:44,527
- And he can't do action. But...
- Well, it's...


1257
00:55:44,527 --> 00:55:45,923
...you can.


1258
00:55:45,923 --> 00:55:47,221
- You can.


1259
00:55:47,221 --> 00:55:48,760
I'm unlimited with you.


1260
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,532
I can do everything
and everything with you,


1261
00:55:50,532 --> 00:55:52,094
and it just made my brain
just...


1262
00:55:53,228 --> 00:55:54,898
So cool.


1263
00:55:54,898 --> 00:55:56,230
I don't need cuts.
I don't need gimmicks. -Really?


1264
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:58,231
I don't need anything.
I just need you.


1265
00:55:58,231 --> 00:55:59,936
- To finish this movie.


1266
00:55:59,936 --> 00:56:02,237
You know, maybe even make it
a great movie. -Wow.


1267
00:56:02,237 --> 00:56:03,579
You know?


1268
00:56:03,579 --> 00:56:05,778
- Wow. Okay.
- What do you think?


1269
00:56:05,778 --> 00:56:07,550
Do you want to work together?


1270
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:10,047
Shoot the shit out of Sydney
Opera House in four hours?


1271
00:56:10,047 --> 00:56:11,751
- Three hours and 52 minutes.
- Three hours and 52 minutes?


1272
00:56:11,751 --> 00:56:13,083
Yeah.


1273
00:56:13,083 --> 00:56:14,523
What are we waiting for?


1274
00:56:14,523 --> 00:56:16,757
Okay, good.
Good! Okay!


1275
00:56:16,757 --> 00:56:18,561
Venti, Venti, come on.


1276
00:56:18,561 --> 00:56:20,463
I'm gonna get some dots
on your face, 'cause I need you


1277
00:56:20,463 --> 00:56:22,387
but not your face. -Oh, God.
Get-- Yeah, just get rid of it.


1278
00:56:22,387 --> 00:56:23,797
Yeah, I'm gonna stick Ryder's
head on you. -All of it. Just--


1279
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,929
- Okay. Cool. Okay, okay.
- Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

I don't know what that was.


1323
00:58:35,664 --> 00:58:37,061
That was just so awful and...


1324
00:58:37,061 --> 00:58:38,998
- Really? Okay.
- Yeah, who's she?

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

It's done. Forget.
You-you never saw it.

Jody, do you like
Christina or Britney?


1329
00:58:52,045 --> 00:58:53,715
I saw that.


1330
00:58:53,715 --> 00:58:56,619
- You saw the finger guns?
- Oh, I saw the finger guns.


1331
00:58:57,851 --> 00:58:59,280
She started it.


1332
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,282
Hi.

00:59:01,282 --> 00:59:03,086
I didn't ha--
I didn't have breakfast.


1334
00:59:03,086 --> 00:59:04,726
Yeah, you did.


1335
00:59:04,726 --> 00:59:06,420
I disagree. -I gave you
a brekky wrap this morning.


1336
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:08,258
Technically,
this is all meal penalty,


1337

- if you want the... -GAIL: Oh.
- It's fine. Just-just sign.


1338
00:59:10,193 --> 00:59:11,864
Thanks. -I'm just saying,
not everyone's gonna be as cool


1339
00:59:11,864 --> 00:59:13,459
- about it as I am. You know?
- No, I get it.


1340
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:15,231
What is this?


1341
00:59:15,231 --> 00:59:19,467
I've got you on a 5:55 flight
out of here. Okay?


1342
00:59:19,467 --> 00:59:20,974
- I have a car waiting for you.
- Now?


1343
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:23,778
Engine's on. Yeah. Colt...


1344
00:59:23,778 --> 00:59:26,539
there is some serious shit
going down, okay?


1345
00:59:26,539 --> 00:59:29,311
I just told Jody I was gonna
meet her for karaoke.


1346
00:59:29,311 --> 00:59:31,083
And I'm actually embarrassed
that I got you here


1347
00:59:31,083 --> 00:59:33,084
- and got you all tangled up.


1348
00:59:33,083 --> 00:59:35,119
I just want to get you out
of here before it escalates.


1349
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:36,625
Get your stuff together.
We're going.


1350
00:59:36,626 --> 00:59:38,552
You're gonna miss the flight.
Thank you.


1351
00:59:38,552 --> 00:59:40,059
- Sorry.
-Okay, but I'm late,


1352
00:59:40,059 --> 00:59:41,665
and I got to get Ryder's dogs
to daycare.


1353
00:59:41,664 --> 00:59:43,590
Fluffy needs her oatmeal bath.
She gets hives.

Hey, should I be
looking for another job, Alma?


1355

You're Ryder's assistant.
You must know.


1356
00:59:47,902 --> 00:59:51,003
All I can tell you is that
if Ryder is a no-show tomorrow,


1357
00:59:51,003 --> 00:59:52,841
the studio will shut us down.


1358

French. I know.


1369
01:00:41,449 --> 01:00:42,891
I worked with him on a movie,
you know.


1370
01:00:42,891 --> 01:00:44,354
Can't believe he kept him.


1371
01:00:44,353 --> 01:00:45,893
Well, it's more for
a party trick, really.


1372
01:00:45,893 --> 01:00:47,455
This one's got a command

1382
01:01:05,813 --> 01:01:08,574
So, the last time I saw Tom,
everything was pretty normal.


1383
01:01:08,574 --> 01:01:11,248
He and Henry were
in some kind of drug-induced,


1384
01:01:11,248 --> 01:01:13,315
shirtless shit-show
grappling match.


1385
01:01:13,315 --> 01:01:16,021
But then Gail called me early
the next morning in a panic.


1386
01:01:16,021 --> 01:01:17,418
Drop whatever you're doing.


1387
01:01:17,418 --> 01:01:18,990
Tom has lost his phone again.


1388
01:01:18,992 --> 01:01:21,259
So I found the phone,
the one that Dressler,


1389
01:01:21,259 --> 01:01:24,063
Ryder's creepy security goon,
just called me about.


1390
01:01:24,063 --> 01:01:25,867
Metalstorm crew,
we have a call time


1391
01:01:25,867 --> 01:01:27,198
of 6:00 a.m. tomorrow. Don't
be late. -All right, mate.


1392
01:01:27,197 --> 01:01:29,498
- All right, thanks, mate!


1393
01:01:29,498 --> 01:01:31,840
Hey. Two shots of tequila,
please. -Ooh, Gail.


1394
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,777
- Hey.
- Wow.


1395
01:01:33,777 --> 01:01:35,603
I didn't think you liked
coming to these things.


1396
01:01:35,603 --> 01:01:37,945
What are you talking about?
I love listening to people


1397
01:01:37,945 --> 01:01:40,342
murder my favorite songs.
Thank you. -


1398
01:01:40,342 --> 01:01:41,750
-  Mmm.
-"Gin and Juice."


1399
01:01:41,751 --> 01:01:43,281
I got to get to karaoke.


1400
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,349
- Hey!


1401
01:01:45,349 --> 01:01:46,416
Thanks, Amy.


1402
01:01:46,416 --> 01:01:47,713
Au revoir, Jean-Claude.


1403
01:01:47,713 --> 01:01:48,956
You got to get rid
of that thing.


1404
01:01:48,956 --> 01:01:50,418
Why don't you just give it
to Gail?


1405
01:01:50,418 --> 01:01:52,420
Whatever's on this phone
is a goddamn bazooka


1406
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:54,192
that'll blow
a movie star-sized hole


1407
01:01:54,193 --> 01:01:55,897
through somebody's career.


1408
01:01:55,896 --> 01:01:58,394
I'm happy to get this
into the hands of a good guy.


1409
01:01:58,394 --> 01:02:00,561
- Okay...
- For the right price.


1410
01:02:00,561 --> 01:02:02,298
What do you want for it?


1411
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:03,806
A producer credit.


1412
01:02:03,806 --> 01:02:05,237
On Metalstorm?


1413
01:02:05,237 --> 01:02:06,302
Look, I need
career protection, okay?


1414
01:02:06,302 --> 01:02:07,403
I'm burning myself with this.


1415
01:02:07,403 --> 01:02:08,811
I'm a stunt guy.


1416
01:02:08,811 --> 01:02:10,813
What am I supposed to do
about it?


1417
01:02:10,813 --> 01:02:12,441
You're a stunt guy
who used to date the director


1418
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,443
and seems to be getting close
to rekindling


1419
01:02:14,443 --> 01:02:17,380
some sort of short but
legendary torrid love affair.


1420
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:18,820
Do you think
we're close to rekindling?


1421
01:02:18,822 --> 01:02:19,954
I mean, it feels like it
to me...


1422
01:02:19,954 --> 01:02:22,286
Is it a deal or not?


1423
01:02:22,286 --> 01:02:24,926
It can help you find Ryder.


1424
01:02:24,927 --> 01:02:26,224
- I'll do what I can.


1425
01:02:26,224 --> 01:02:27,653
I don't have the passcode.


1426
01:02:27,655 --> 01:02:29,393
Just figure it out,
okay, stuntman?


1427
01:02:29,393 --> 01:02:30,657
Just find Ryder.


1428
01:02:30,657 --> 01:02:32,132
I'm gonna need you
to sign an NDA.


1429
01:02:32,132 --> 01:02:33,626
As you know,
nothing in this industry...


1430
01:02:33,626 --> 01:02:35,298
I don't have time for an NDA.
I got to--


1431
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:36,399
- I'm late for karaoke.
-  -


1432
01:02:45,914 --> 01:02:47,608
Jean-Claude!


1433
01:02:50,514 --> 01:02:52,548
Ryder's phone. Where is it?


1434
01:02:59,686 --> 01:03:01,864
What am I doing?
What am I doing?


1435
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:06,197
- You sad that he left town?
- Who?


1436
01:03:06,197 --> 01:03:07,936
- Colt.
- No, he didn't.


1437
01:03:07,936 --> 01:03:10,038
He's coming here. He's swinging
by to sing some karaoke.


1438
01:03:10,038 --> 01:03:11,599
Jody. No.


1439
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:13,842
I... I gave him the tickets.


1440
01:03:16,342 --> 01:03:18,672
- I see it! I see it!


1441
01:03:21,083 --> 01:03:23,182
- Engage your core.


1442
01:03:38,561 --> 01:03:40,793
I need him to finish the movie.


1443
01:03:40,793 --> 01:03:43,565
Why would-- why wouldn't you
talk to me about it?


1444
01:03:49,871 --> 01:03:51,277
Give me that.


1445
01:03:52,949 --> 01:03:54,311
- Fine.


1446
01:03:54,311 --> 01:03:55,378
Call me chicken.


1447
01:03:55,378 --> 01:03:56,809
- Huh?


1448
01:03:56,809 --> 01:03:58,547
All right. Okay, tough guy.


1449
01:04:09,427 --> 01:04:11,394
Okay, Jean-Claude.


1450
01:04:11,394 --> 01:04:13,396
I'll buy you a drink
when this is over.


1451
01:04:13,396 --> 01:04:15,697
- Attaque!


1452
01:04:16,864 --> 01:04:18,731
Get away! Help! Help!


1453
01:04:18,731 --> 01:04:21,239
You've been so distracted.
You should have spoken to me.


1454
01:04:21,239 --> 01:04:22,669
This crossed wires-- Excuse me.


1455
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:24,210
Can I get another, please?
Thank you.


1456
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:28,875
God!


1457
01:04:28,875 --> 01:04:31,217
-  Get me out!


1458
01:04:38,391 --> 01:04:41,886
Stay back! Stay back!
Stay back! Stay back!


1459
01:04:48,974 --> 01:04:51,731
I thought you wanted me
to get rid of him.


1460
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:54,340
And he just left?


1461
01:04:56,606 --> 01:04:58,476
Gonna need a hand out here.


1462
01:04:59,949 --> 01:05:01,577
Who are you working for?!
Where's Ryder?!


1463
01:05:01,577 --> 01:05:02,875
- I don't know! I don't know!
- Tell me where he is!


1464
01:05:02,875 --> 01:05:04,581
- Oh.


1465
01:05:11,358 --> 01:05:13,161
- Where's the phone, stuntman?


1466
01:05:13,161 --> 01:05:15,293
I need that video!


1467
01:05:15,293 --> 01:05:17,065
Wow, he didn't tell you.


1468
01:05:17,065 --> 01:05:18,461
Jean-Claude!


1469
01:05:22,963 --> 01:05:25,008
Can I get another one, please?


1470
01:05:28,144 --> 01:05:29,407
-I...
- Thank you.


1471
01:05:29,407 --> 01:05:30,606
I really thought
I was doing my job.


1472
01:05:30,606 --> 01:05:32,510
It's fine. It's fine.


1473
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:34,907
- But you know what?
- He can do whatever he wants.


1474
01:05:34,907 --> 01:05:37,481
He's an adult human male,
and he should do as he pleases.


1475
01:05:37,481 --> 01:05:39,087
- He should just...
- Right. Yeah, he is.


1476
01:05:39,086 --> 01:05:40,483
...you know,
go his own way, you know?


1477
01:05:40,483 --> 01:05:42,255
But that means
y-you can focus up now.


1478
01:05:42,255 --> 01:05:43,914
- Yeah.
- You know, you have a massive--


1479
01:05:43,916 --> 01:05:45,687
Do you know you have
a big, fat hit on your hands?


1480
01:05:45,686 --> 01:05:47,490
I know. Yeah.


1481
01:05:47,490 --> 01:05:49,295
- It's High Noon at...
- High Noon.


1482
01:05:49,295 --> 01:05:50,956
- ...the edge of the universe.
- Edge of the universe.


1483

Yes. Hear it yourself.


1484

Forget about him. Just...


1485
01:05:54,795 --> 01:05:56,532
All right, uh, next up,
uh, we got a Jody.


1486

- Wow. God. -GAIL: Yes!

- Brake!
- I can't!


1529
01:08:47,804 --> 01:08:49,376
There's something stuck!


1530
01:08:49,376 --> 01:08:50,708
Jean-Claude,
what are you doing?!


1531
01:08:50,707 --> 01:08:51,707

She left. Where were you?


1546
01:09:54,903 --> 01:09:56,938
At a rave? In a sewer?


1547
01:09:56,938 --> 01:10:00,074
- What's with the dog?
- It's a long story.


1548
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:03,847
Give me a sunset on ice
and a water back.


1549
01:10:03,846 --> 01:10:05,110

It's Ryder's phone.


1554
01:10:13,295 --> 01:10:15,122
- Why do you have Ryder's phone?
- All I know is


1555
01:10:15,122 --> 01:10:16,893
some really bad guys
are trying to get it.


1556
01:10:16,893 --> 01:10:18,532
Are you serious? What?


1557
01:10:18,532 --> 01:10:20,565
I just got to figure out
what's on there.


1558
01:10:21,768 --> 01:10:23,932
Then find Ryder and get him
to finish Jody's movie.


1559
01:10:23,932 --> 01:10:26,065
Okay. Well, shit, yeah.


1560
01:10:26,065 --> 01:10:27,804
Venti, she's like a tech genius
at this stuff.


1561
01:10:27,805 --> 01:10:29,542
- Thank you!


1562
01:10:29,542 --> 01:10:30,742
Hey, Venti!


1563
01:10:30,742 --> 01:10:32,545
- Ventilicious.
- Hey.


1564
01:10:32,545 --> 01:10:34,449
What's poppin' on, boys?


1565
01:10:34,448 --> 01:10:37,748
- Yeah, Ventinator.


1566
01:10:37,748 --> 01:10:39,849
You know how
to get into this thing?


1567
01:10:41,149 --> 01:10:43,623
Oh, I've seen
some of these guys.


1568
01:10:43,622 --> 01:10:45,723
This thing is a vault.


1569
01:10:45,724 --> 01:10:47,626
It'll take me like two or
three days to crack this thing.


1570
01:10:47,626 --> 01:10:49,431
Yeah, but you're like
a tech genius, you know?


1571
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:51,125
What if you don't have
three days?


1572
01:10:51,125 --> 01:10:52,500
You need the password.
I'm telling you that.


1573
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,666
- You're next.


1574
01:10:54,666 --> 01:10:56,372
Nigel. Nigel!


1575
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:00,506
Knowing Ryder, it's...


1576
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:03,003
written on a Post-it note
in his apartment somewhere.


1577
01:11:03,003 --> 01:11:04,841
Okay.


1578
01:11:04,841 --> 01:11:07,106
Okay, next up, we've got Dan.


1579
01:11:07,106 --> 01:11:09,077
Come on, buddy. Come on, Dan.


1580
01:11:09,077 --> 01:11:10,649
Don't be shy, mate.


1581
01:11:10,649 --> 01:11:12,750
Come on, buddy. Let's go.


1582
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:14,047
You owe me!


1583
01:11:19,122 --> 01:11:21,122
It's got
to be around here somewhere.


1584
01:11:21,122 --> 01:11:22,893
Mm-hmm. -Let's just split up.
Jean-Claude...


1585
01:11:41,144 --> 01:11:42,748
Hello.


1586
01:11:53,497 --> 01:11:54,923
Oh.


1587
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:59,226
You know what? I deserve this.


1588
01:12:01,604 --> 01:12:02,867
Idiot.


1589
01:12:05,365 --> 01:12:06,871
Colt?


1590
01:12:06,871 --> 01:12:09,510
Colt! I got it! Colt!


1591
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:10,841
To finishing the movie.


1592
01:12:10,841 --> 01:12:12,546
I think I got it.


1593
01:12:13,713 --> 01:12:15,143
All right.


1594
01:12:15,143 --> 01:12:16,979
That guy mentioned a video.


1595
01:12:16,979 --> 01:12:19,817
Oh, baby, I'm here at work,


1596
01:12:19,817 --> 01:12:22,248
but I got a little something
for you, a little surprise.


1597
01:12:22,248 --> 01:12:24,085
It's just above my ass. Eh?


1598
01:12:24,085 --> 01:12:25,989
Oh, my God. Cover your eyes.


1599
01:12:25,988 --> 01:12:28,253
I think I've seen Tom's ass
more than my own. -


1600
01:12:28,253 --> 01:12:29,530
Okay.


1601
01:12:29,530 --> 01:12:32,159
Now is the winter
of our discontent


1602
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:34,666
Made glorious summer
by this sun of York...


1603
01:12:34,667 --> 01:12:35,999
He's such a dick.


1604
01:12:35,998 --> 01:12:37,900
But, God, he's good.


1605
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:39,440
Yeah.


1606
01:12:40,399 --> 01:12:41,740
What about this?


1607
01:12:44,204 --> 01:12:46,746
Oh, here's that party his
assistant was talking about.


1608
01:12:47,814 --> 01:12:49,550
Iggy.


1609
01:12:49,550 --> 01:12:51,619
That's Henry.
That's Ryder's stunt double.


1610
01:12:53,918 --> 01:12:55,984
He looks a lot like the guy
I saw at the hotel.


1611
01:12:58,055 --> 01:13:01,253
When you were high?
And you were seeing unicorns?


1612
01:13:01,253 --> 01:13:03,630
And a dead guy on ice.


1613
01:13:08,734 --> 01:13:11,066
Hell yeah! Come on!


1614
01:13:11,065 --> 01:13:13,036
What?! What?!


1615
01:13:13,036 --> 01:13:15,069
Do I do my own stunts?


1616
01:13:15,069 --> 01:13:16,400
I think I do.


1617
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,546
I think I freakin' do.


1618
01:13:18,546 --> 01:13:19,976
Yeah, baby.


1619
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:30,458
Uh, gimme, gimme,
gimme, gimme...


1620
01:13:30,458 --> 01:13:31,525
Gimme the phone.
Gimme the phone.


1621
01:13:34,697 --> 01:13:36,960
- Oh, shit.
- Did they just kill Henry?


1622
01:13:46,675 --> 01:13:48,939
They just killed Henry.


1623
01:13:48,939 --> 01:13:50,941
- Oh, it's Venti.


1624
01:13:51,978 --> 01:13:53,405
- Hey, uh... Hello?
-Dan.


1625
01:13:53,405 --> 01:13:55,518
Turn on the news right now.


1626
01:13:56,619 --> 01:13:58,916
I can't believe this!


1627
01:13:58,916 --> 01:14:01,820
The dead body discovered this
morning at the Pendleton Hotel


1628
01:14:01,819 --> 01:14:04,449
has been identified
as Henry Herrera,


1629
01:14:04,449 --> 01:14:07,760
an American stuntman known for
doubling superstar Tom Ryder.


1630
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:10,664
Authorities are investigating
his death as a murder.


1631
01:14:10,664 --> 01:14:12,765
Their prime suspect
is another stuntman,


1632
01:14:12,765 --> 01:14:14,998
Colt Seavers, who was
last seen in the hotel room


1633
01:14:14,998 --> 01:14:17,836
where Herrera's body
was discovered.


1634
01:14:17,836 --> 01:14:20,542
Police have released
this security footage


1635
01:14:20,542 --> 01:14:23,370
showing Seavers leaving
the scene of the crime.


1636
01:14:23,369 --> 01:14:25,844
If you have any information,
please do us a favor,


1637
01:14:25,844 --> 01:14:28,715
reach out to Crime Stoppers
by the number on your screen.


1638
01:14:28,715 --> 01:14:31,487
And we'll have more on that
later. In the meantime...


1639
01:14:35,317 --> 01:14:37,119
I got to call Jody.


1640
01:14:37,119 --> 01:14:39,318
RYDER
It's high noon


1641
01:14:39,319 --> 01:14:41,828
at the edge of
the universe, folks.


1642
01:14:42,993 --> 01:14:44,159
Which one was that?


1643
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:45,534
That was take four.


1644
01:14:45,534 --> 01:14:47,063
RYDER
Goddamn it, Jody.


1645
01:14:47,063 --> 01:14:48,734
I mean, it looks like
frickin' Burning Man.


1646
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:51,539
My balls are drenched.
I need a towel.


1647
01:14:54,369 --> 01:14:57,336
This dude always forgets
that he's mic'd.


1648
01:14:57,337 --> 01:14:59,406
- I know.
- He says the craziest shit.


1649
01:14:59,405 --> 01:15:01,715
Craziest shit. I know, I know.


1650
01:15:01,715 --> 01:15:03,750
What, is it on airplane mode?


1651
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:05,851
If this was The Fugitive


1652
01:15:05,851 --> 01:15:09,349
and you were Harrison Ford...


1653
01:15:09,350 --> 01:15:11,923
the bad guys would be
closing in.


1654
01:15:13,827 --> 01:15:15,158
I call tomahawk.


1655
01:15:15,158 --> 01:15:16,698
- Damn it.
- You stay alive.


1656
01:15:16,698 --> 01:15:18,193
Stay alive.


1657
01:15:18,193 --> 01:15:20,063
No matter how long it takes.


1658
01:15:20,063 --> 01:15:22,703
No matter how far, I will


1659
01:15:22,703 --> 01:15:25,036
find you!


1660
01:15:25,036 --> 01:15:27,168
- Last of the Mohicans.
- Ah,


1661
01:15:27,168 --> 01:15:28,742
boy! Stunts!


1662
01:15:28,743 --> 01:15:31,437
Damn it.


1663
01:15:42,989 --> 01:15:45,483
Shit, is this rubber? Oh, God.


1664
01:16:00,434 --> 01:16:02,645
- Daniel Day-Lewis!


1665
01:16:17,757 --> 01:16:19,728
Jason Bourne!


1666
01:16:35,336 --> 01:16:37,007
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson!


1667
01:16:38,341 --> 01:16:40,375
- Give me the phone!


1668
01:16:45,612 --> 01:16:47,118
Where's the phone, stuntman?


1669
01:16:47,118 --> 01:16:48,987
We got to get this phone
to the cops.


1670
01:16:48,987 --> 01:16:50,692
-Okay.
-It's the only thing--


1671
01:17:18,479 --> 01:17:19,853
Hey, man bun!


1672
01:17:19,854 --> 01:17:21,954
Where's the phone, stuntman?


1673
01:17:21,954 --> 01:17:25,320
Jean-Claude, attaque!


1674
01:17:35,563 --> 01:17:36,837
I'm gonna take that.


1675
01:17:36,837 --> 01:17:38,367
Be careful of that, big fella.


1676
01:17:38,367 --> 01:17:40,005
Shut up!


1677
01:17:41,239 --> 01:17:42,975
I'm gonna go out the front
and make sure no one's there.


1678
01:17:42,975 --> 01:17:44,240
- Okay.
- All right.


1679
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:45,307
Hey, take Jean-Claude,
would you?


1680
01:17:45,307 --> 01:17:47,541
- Okay. Allons-y!


1681
01:17:49,609 --> 01:17:52,511
Just you and me, stuntman.


1682
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:54,216
Shit.


1683
01:18:05,527 --> 01:18:07,164
Colt's down.


1684
01:18:07,164 --> 01:18:10,332
Big fella got away, though.


1685
01:18:10,332 --> 01:18:12,135
Uh-huh.


1686
01:18:18,881 --> 01:18:21,981
You can make it. You can
make it. You can make it!


1687
01:18:22,952 --> 01:18:25,050
No! It's too dangerous!


1688
01:18:25,050 --> 01:18:26,755
Got to be stairs.


1689
01:18:26,755 --> 01:18:28,956
Okay, okay, okay, okay!


1690
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:46,600
Colt. Hey, man.


1691
01:18:50,438 --> 01:18:54,442
Look at that.
Yeah, makin' a movie here.


1692
01:18:55,445 --> 01:18:57,247
Could you leave us, please?


1693
01:18:58,515 --> 01:18:59,854
Yeah.


1694
01:19:02,155 --> 01:19:04,760
Ooh, Gail. So tense.


1695
01:19:05,927 --> 01:19:07,961
You remember old Dressy, right?


1696
01:19:10,095 --> 01:19:11,458
Stuntman.


1697
01:19:11,458 --> 01:19:13,934
I never forget a fist.


1698
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:17,498
Listen, I'm gonna need
the phone. Where is it?


1699
01:19:17,498 --> 01:19:19,774
It's a matter of urgency.
I need to know.


1700
01:19:21,503 --> 01:19:24,912
Right. The one that proves
that you killed Henry, not me.


1701
01:19:24,912 --> 01:19:26,176
- Eh...
- That phone.


1702
01:19:26,176 --> 01:19:27,409
- Well...
- Yeah.


1703
01:19:27,409 --> 01:19:29,247
I'm gonna hold on to that.


1704
01:19:29,247 --> 01:19:31,282
Seems like it's the only thing
keeping me alive right now.


1705
01:19:31,282 --> 01:19:33,315
What?


1706
01:19:33,315 --> 01:19:35,989
He's the prime suspect, Jody.


1707
01:19:35,989 --> 01:19:39,024
Gail, come on.
Are you kidding me?


1708
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:40,421
- I know.
- Colt?


1709
01:19:40,421 --> 01:19:41,654
- Yeah.
- There's no way.


1710
01:19:41,654 --> 01:19:42,688
- That's what I said.
- There's no way!


1711
01:19:42,688 --> 01:19:44,096
What went wrong?


1712
01:19:44,096 --> 01:19:46,032
- What went wrong?
- Mmm.


1713
01:19:46,033 --> 01:19:48,035
What went wrong?
Well, as I look at it,


1714
01:19:48,034 --> 01:19:49,872
you know, you're--
you're torturing me


1715
01:19:49,872 --> 01:19:51,939
right outside your superyacht
like a Bond villain.


1716
01:19:51,939 --> 01:19:52,974
Dipshit!


1717
01:19:52,974 --> 01:19:54,733
What went wrong?


1718
01:19:55,703 --> 01:19:57,846
What went right?!


1719
01:19:59,015 --> 01:20:02,609
You changed.


1720
01:20:02,609 --> 01:20:05,283
You changed.


1721
01:20:05,283 --> 01:20:09,958
Yeah. We used to be
like brothers, you and I.


1722
01:20:09,957 --> 01:20:13,125
Entered into the sacred bond
of actor and stuntman, man.


1723
01:20:13,125 --> 01:20:14,895
- Oh, God.
- Yeah.


1724
01:20:14,895 --> 01:20:16,623
You think Colt could murder
a human being?


1725
01:20:16,623 --> 01:20:18,228
-No, I don't.
- Did you tell them that?


1726
01:20:18,229 --> 01:20:19,561
- I said that.
- This is a man--


1727
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:21,034
This is a man
who spent 23 minutes


1728
01:20:21,034 --> 01:20:22,662
ushering a cockroach
out of my room once,


1729
01:20:22,662 --> 01:20:24,037
and I was like, "Just stomp
on it," and he was like,


1730
01:20:24,037 --> 01:20:25,830
"No, let it live."
I mean, it's Colt.


1731
01:20:25,831 --> 01:20:27,469
I told them all of that.


1732
01:20:27,469 --> 01:20:30,143
I told him who he is--
who I thought he was.


1733
01:20:30,143 --> 01:20:31,506
Did you, emphatically?


1734
01:20:31,506 --> 01:20:33,046
- Yes, I did.
- Yeah, because he


1735
01:20:33,046 --> 01:20:35,016
was at the airport
where you sent him.


1736
01:20:35,015 --> 01:20:36,840
He never got on the plane, Jody.


1737
01:20:36,841 --> 01:20:38,414
- How many movies have we done?
- Oh, I don't know.


1738
01:20:38,414 --> 01:20:40,152
How many? Yeah, too many
to count, that's right.


1739
01:20:40,152 --> 01:20:42,186
Yeah. -'Cause I put you
in the contract, didn't I?


1740
01:20:42,186 --> 01:20:43,684
I put you there, right there.


1741
01:20:43,684 --> 01:20:45,355
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah? That's right,


1742
01:20:45,354 --> 01:20:46,718
I had the assistant,
the makeup and hair... -Right.


1743
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:48,326
...uh, trainer, and then boom,


1744
01:20:48,326 --> 01:20:50,559
Ryder's number one stuntman,
Colt Seavers.


1745
01:20:50,559 --> 01:20:52,824
That was me, I did that.
I did that for you.


1746
01:20:52,824 --> 01:20:55,266
What are you gonna
do for me? Huh?


1747
01:20:55,266 --> 01:20:57,599
Die, I guess?


1748
01:20:57,599 --> 01:20:59,204
Right? Die?


1749
01:20:59,204 --> 01:21:00,733
- Is that the plan?
-It's nothing personal.


1750
01:21:00,733 --> 01:21:02,240
Oh, my God.
Well, I'm taking it personal.


1751
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:03,604
- Yeah, I can see that.
- The torture.


1752
01:21:03,604 --> 01:21:05,342
You know what?
It's just business.


1753
01:21:05,341 --> 01:21:06,739
- The drugging, the Taser.
- You know, it's just business.


1754
01:21:06,739 --> 01:21:08,279
I mean, Tom Ryder's
a global brand.


1755
01:21:08,279 --> 01:21:10,050
- I'm taking it personal.
- I literally move markets.


1756
01:21:10,050 --> 01:21:13,186
If I go down...
the freakin' Dow goes down.


1757
01:21:13,185 --> 01:21:17,288
If you break your back,
I replace you like this. Boom.


1758
01:21:17,288 --> 01:21:19,256
You know, if you'd just
stuck to your job


1759
01:21:19,256 --> 01:21:21,391
instead of trying to
hog the spotlight,


1760
01:21:21,391 --> 01:21:23,229
this wouldn't have happened.
I mean, Henry wouldn't be


1761
01:21:23,229 --> 01:21:25,363
on the scene, his accident
wouldn't have happened,


1762
01:21:25,363 --> 01:21:27,936
your accident...
freaky little fall.


1763
01:21:27,936 --> 01:21:29,729
'Cause you just
push my buttons, man.


1764
01:21:29,729 --> 01:21:30,895
Wait a second. What?


1765
01:21:32,435 --> 01:21:34,865
What?


1766
01:21:34,867 --> 01:21:37,208
What did you say
about my accident?


1767
01:21:37,208 --> 01:21:39,079
Well, you know,
you pushed me over the edge.


1768
01:21:39,079 --> 01:21:41,082
You literally pushed a button.
I mean, you didn't--


1769
01:21:41,082 --> 01:21:43,579
I mean, I pushed the button.


1770
01:21:46,990 --> 01:21:49,750
I had to crank it up a notch.


1771
01:21:56,527 --> 01:21:57,966
That was you?


1772
01:21:57,966 --> 01:21:59,594
Yeah.


1773
01:22:03,006 --> 01:22:05,238
Had to teach you
a little lesson, didn't I?


1774
01:22:05,238 --> 01:22:07,240
Got a little
too big for your boots,


1775
01:22:07,239 --> 01:22:08,734
didn't you?


1776
01:22:08,734 --> 01:22:10,173
Henry's no different, you know.


1777
01:22:11,573 --> 01:22:14,741
Hey. You do your own stunts?


1778
01:22:14,742 --> 01:22:16,347
Do I do my own stunts?


1779
01:22:16,347 --> 01:22:18,988
In front of all those people,
that's humiliating.


1780
01:22:18,988 --> 01:22:21,056
And yeah, I'm gonna
kick you into next week.


1781
01:22:23,323 --> 01:22:26,257
But then Gail, you know...


1782
01:22:26,257 --> 01:22:28,657
- Remember Gail, right?
- I've known her for 15 years.


1783
01:22:28,657 --> 01:22:30,362
Oh, yeah. I forget, 'cause
you've been out of the game


1784
01:22:30,362 --> 01:22:31,957
- so long, you know?
- I introduced the two of you.


1785
01:22:31,957 --> 01:22:33,463
Calls me up and says,
"It doesn't look good."


1786
01:22:33,462 --> 01:22:36,037
Bad for marketing and renting,


1787
01:22:36,037 --> 01:22:38,269
and blah, blah, blah,
and murder and...


1788
01:22:38,270 --> 01:22:40,437
I know, I-I-I d--


1789
01:22:40,436 --> 01:22:44,210
I real-- I really
don't need this right now.


1790
01:22:44,210 --> 01:22:46,180
Fucking Henry!


1791
01:22:46,180 --> 01:22:48,280
Don't worry about it.


1792
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:50,514
You lay low...


1793
01:22:50,514 --> 01:22:52,152
and I will handle everything.


1794
01:22:53,519 --> 01:22:56,619
Maybe we don't know people
as well as we think we do.


1795
01:22:56,618 --> 01:22:59,060
- Oh, my God.
- You know?


1796
01:23:00,020 --> 01:23:01,128
Oh, my God, it's Colt.


1797
01:23:01,127 --> 01:23:02,557
- Give me the phone.
- No.


1798
01:23:02,559 --> 01:23:04,230
- What are you doing?
- Gail, get off the pho--


1799
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:05,692
- Oh! What are you doing?
- Oh, my-- Jesus Christ, Gail!


1800
01:23:05,693 --> 01:23:08,168
- Oh, my-- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, my God.


1801
01:23:08,167 --> 01:23:09,630
- Let me help you.
- No, stop it.


1802
01:23:09,631 --> 01:23:10,864
- Let me take it up to--
- Do you know what?


1803
01:23:10,863 --> 01:23:11,996
- Just give me a minute.
- Yep.


1804
01:23:11,997 --> 01:23:13,141
Just give me a minute.


1805
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:15,373
- Yep.
- Come on.


1806
01:23:16,342 --> 01:23:18,574
This plan was so simple.


1807
01:23:18,574 --> 01:23:21,005
Yeah, we were gonna put
Henry's body on ice


1808
01:23:21,005 --> 01:23:22,743
so it doesn't decompose.


1809
01:23:22,743 --> 01:23:25,414
We could pull you out from
that rock you crawled under.


1810
01:23:25,416 --> 01:23:27,452
- My life, yep.
- You know, scan your face.


1811
01:23:29,291 --> 01:23:31,390
Dressy here is gonna stick you
on the murder video.


1812
01:23:31,390 --> 01:23:33,094
Drug you, drive you
and Henry's body


1813
01:23:33,094 --> 01:23:36,020
off the Sydney Harbour Bridge,
in your car-- boom.


1814
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:38,364
You got murder, suicide.


1815
01:23:38,363 --> 01:23:39,826
Cut. Check the gate.


1816
01:23:39,827 --> 01:23:41,498
Move on. Beautiful.


1817
01:23:41,498 --> 01:23:43,434
I think we have different ideas
of what simple is.


1818
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:45,030
Y-You just didn't
stay down, did you?


1819
01:23:45,029 --> 01:23:46,898
You had to, like, uh,
create a big scene,


1820
01:23:46,899 --> 01:23:48,604
like Colt Seavers does.


1821
01:23:48,604 --> 01:23:50,837
You could-- But you know what?
This can still work


1822
01:23:50,837 --> 01:23:54,511
because we got the murder,
now we just need the suicide.


1823
01:23:57,515 --> 01:23:59,451
- Sad.
- It's plot heavy.


1824
01:23:59,451 --> 01:24:01,453
We're getting tangled
in exposition.


1825
01:24:01,453 --> 01:24:03,256
Lose the last part--
the suicide.


1826
01:24:03,256 --> 01:24:05,226
You lose the audience
if there's too much.


1827
01:24:05,225 --> 01:24:06,622
Colt.


1828
01:24:06,622 --> 01:24:07,853
Where's the phone?


1829
01:24:07,854 --> 01:24:11,199
Tom, you need carbs!


1830
01:24:11,198 --> 01:24:14,432
Your brain runs on glucose!


1831
01:24:14,432 --> 01:24:17,204
For simple cognitive functions.


1832
01:24:17,204 --> 01:24:19,635
- You need them.
- Colt, you're the fall guy.


1833
01:24:19,635 --> 01:24:21,802
You're the fall guy, you know.


1834
01:24:21,801 --> 01:24:24,442
Where's the phone?


1835
01:24:24,442 --> 01:24:26,742
I mean, I-- You can keep
taking hits all night,


1836
01:24:26,742 --> 01:24:28,282
but you know what?


1837
01:24:28,282 --> 01:24:30,315
I can think of a few
other people who can't.


1838
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:33,880
We could bring Dan up here,
maybe Jody, perhaps.


1839
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:35,916
I mean, I like Jody,
but you know.


1840
01:24:35,916 --> 01:24:38,226
There's no phone.


1841
01:24:38,225 --> 01:24:39,787
Okay? That's the twist.


1842
01:24:39,787 --> 01:24:41,228
No phone.


1843
01:24:41,229 --> 01:24:44,056
He shot it out of my hand.


1844
01:24:44,055 --> 01:24:45,627
Up there, go check.


1845
01:24:45,627 --> 01:24:48,168
You, too, all of you.
I'll wait.


1846
01:24:48,168 --> 01:24:50,797
-  He shot it.
- You didn't know you did that?


1847
01:24:50,797 --> 01:24:53,438
It's crazy. I've been wanting
to tell you this whole time.


1848
01:24:53,438 --> 01:24:54,770
No, he didn't.


1849
01:24:54,770 --> 01:24:56,805
- I was by the door frame.
- No.


1850
01:24:56,805 --> 01:24:58,972
And he shoots it
out of my hands!


1851
01:24:58,971 --> 01:25:00,509
- No.
- Take the ties off.


1852
01:25:00,511 --> 01:25:02,415
- Oh, my God, what a relief.
- That's crazy.


1853
01:25:02,414 --> 01:25:04,614
You were right about one thing,
that was the only thing


1854
01:25:04,614 --> 01:25:07,914
keeping you alive.


1855
01:25:07,914 --> 01:25:09,652
I really wish you could see


1856
01:25:09,652 --> 01:25:11,082
what Jody's gonna do
with Metalstorm.


1857
01:25:11,082 --> 01:25:12,588
It's gonna be awesome.


1858
01:25:12,588 --> 01:25:16,296
And honestly...
it's gonna be a banger.


1859
01:25:17,563 --> 01:25:19,530
Not so cocky now,
are you, mate?


1860
01:25:19,530 --> 01:25:21,961
Jesus, Mike Mike,
put a lid on it.


1861
01:25:26,408 --> 01:25:28,474
Wish you didn't
break that bond, bro.


1862
01:25:28,474 --> 01:25:30,036
Wish you didn't break that bond.


1863
01:25:30,036 --> 01:25:32,444
All right, stuntman,
time for a drink, mate. Eh?


1864
01:25:32,444 --> 01:25:35,480
- There we go. Eh?


1865
01:25:35,479 --> 01:25:37,141
Help!


1866
01:25:37,141 --> 01:25:38,979
- Help!


1867
01:25:38,979 --> 01:25:40,716
- Shut up. Shut up.
- Help!


1868
01:25:40,716 --> 01:25:42,718
Shut up, mate.


1869
01:25:51,234 --> 01:25:52,696
There.


1870
01:25:52,695 --> 01:25:54,234
This fire gag's real.


1871
01:26:08,944 --> 01:26:10,481
Come on, guys, start the boat.


1872
01:26:10,481 --> 01:26:11,849
He's gone the wrong way.


1873
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:25,729
Shit!


1874
01:27:37,128 --> 01:27:38,966
Oh, Colt.


1875
01:27:38,966 --> 01:27:40,066
Colt?


1876
01:27:40,065 --> 01:27:41,440
- Hey.
- What's going on?


1877
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:42,475
What'd you sing?


1878
01:27:42,475 --> 01:27:44,344
- What?
- At karaoke.


1879
01:27:44,345 --> 01:27:45,743
- I'm sorry I didn't make it.
- It doesn't matter.


1880
01:27:45,743 --> 01:27:47,315
Listen. Everyone's saying
you killed Henry.


1881
01:27:47,314 --> 01:27:48,976
- What's happening?
- Oh, that's not true.


1882
01:27:48,976 --> 01:27:50,516
You're gonna hear a lot
of things that aren't true.


1883
01:27:50,516 --> 01:27:53,322
I just wanted to say that
when I first got here,


1884
01:27:53,322 --> 01:27:55,422
when you asked how I was doing
and I gave you the thumbs-up,


1885
01:27:55,421 --> 01:27:56,983
when you were like,
"That's stunt guy bullshit,"


1886
01:27:56,984 --> 01:27:59,250
and you're right,
it's total cliché,


1887
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:01,020
but, you know,
there's a reason you don't see


1888
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:02,791
the thumbs-down stunt guy.


1889
01:28:04,698 --> 01:28:07,435
You know, it's kind of part
of our training.


1890
01:28:07,435 --> 01:28:09,964
Right? You know,
you get hit by a car,


1891
01:28:09,963 --> 01:28:11,471
you get thrown out of a window,


1892
01:28:11,471 --> 01:28:13,375
you get set on fire,
you give the thumbs-up.


1893
01:28:13,375 --> 01:28:15,837
But, uh, after my accident--


1894
01:28:15,837 --> 01:28:19,841
turns out was not an accident,
by the way--


1895
01:28:19,841 --> 01:28:22,712
I, uh...


1896
01:28:22,712 --> 01:28:24,518
I wasn't okay.


1897
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:27,883
And not because I broke my back,


1898
01:28:27,882 --> 01:28:31,492
because I just felt
like a huge...


1899
01:28:31,492 --> 01:28:33,256
failure.


1900
01:28:36,323 --> 01:28:38,323
And I realized that, uh...


1901
01:28:38,323 --> 01:28:40,831
you know, I'm not invincible.


1902
01:28:40,831 --> 01:28:42,536
Huge shocker.


1903
01:28:43,737 --> 01:28:46,539
And I thought maybe
I wasn't so special


1904
01:28:46,539 --> 01:28:48,332
or something, so I, uh...


1905
01:28:48,332 --> 01:28:50,906
just figured that
the thumbs-down version of me


1906
01:28:50,907 --> 01:28:53,744
wasn't what you got
into it for, so I disappeared.


1907
01:28:53,744 --> 01:28:56,242
But, you know, I didn't
just disappear on you.


1908
01:28:56,242 --> 01:28:59,552
Uh... just disappeared on,


1909
01:28:59,551 --> 01:29:04,048
on, uh, myself... too.


1910
01:29:05,791 --> 01:29:07,592
Anyway, I'm sorry.


1911
01:29:07,592 --> 01:29:09,595
You deserved more than that.
I'm sorry.


1912
01:29:09,595 --> 01:29:11,862
I just wanted you to be honest.


1913
01:29:12,930 --> 01:29:16,293
You know, honestly,
it, uh, all hurts.


1914
01:29:21,707 --> 01:29:24,071
Getting hit by a car hurts.


1915
01:29:24,072 --> 01:29:26,074
Getting thrown out
of a window hurts.


1916
01:29:26,073 --> 01:29:30,208
Getting set on fire
really hurts.


1917
01:29:30,208 --> 01:29:33,421
But, uh...


1918
01:29:36,658 --> 01:29:38,988
...none of it ever hurt as much
as not being with you.


1919
01:29:41,563 --> 01:29:43,255
Where are you?


1920
01:29:44,730 --> 01:29:47,864
Is that from a movie
or did I just make that up?


1921
01:29:47,864 --> 01:29:49,568
It's pretty good.


1922
01:29:49,569 --> 01:29:51,065
-There he is!
- You can use it if you want.


1923
01:29:54,609 --> 01:29:56,136
No, please...


1924
01:29:56,136 --> 01:29:58,171
For what it's worth,
I'm still in love with you.


1925
01:29:59,779 --> 01:30:01,978
And I don't think you should
give up on that happy ending.


1926
01:30:01,978 --> 01:30:03,176
Colt.


1927
01:30:04,081 --> 01:30:05,784

Jody, you need
to be quiet. Don't say a word.


1981
01:34:10,590 --> 01:34:12,194
Wait, wait. No.

Wait!

01:34:48,804 --> 01:34:50,595
It's me. It's me.


1986
01:34:51,939 --> 01:34:53,599
Remember?


1987
01:34:53,599 --> 01:34:56,007
Jesus Christ.


1988
01:34:56,006 --> 01:34:57,502
I knew it.


1989
01:34:57,502 --> 01:34:58,603
- I knew it.


1990
01:34:59,878 --> 01:35:01,914
I knew you were alive.


1991
01:35:01,914 --> 01:35:03,046
Three shows a day,


1992
01:35:03,046 --> 01:35:04,114
six days a week for three years.


1993
01:35:04,114 --> 01:35:05,984
The Miami Vice stunt show.


1994
01:35:07,416 --> 01:35:08,789
You remembered.


1995
01:35:08,789 --> 01:35:11,582
Yes.
I'm happy you're alive, Colt.


1996
01:35:11,582 --> 01:35:13,519
Colt, I'm so happy you're alive.


1997
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:15,060
- I knew it.
- Oh, my God.


1998
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:16,896
- What were you doing...
- Nice work with the pen.


1999
01:35:16,895 --> 01:35:18,259
So sorry. -No, it was great.
You got it out just in time.


2000
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:19,932
I think the ink poisoning
didn't set in.


2001
01:35:19,932 --> 01:35:22,395
-  Chef's kiss.
- What's going on?


2002
01:35:22,395 --> 01:35:24,266
Huh? -Everyone's saying
that you killed Henry.


2003
01:35:24,266 --> 01:35:26,434
Ryder killed Henry.
He framed me.


2004
01:35:26,434 --> 01:35:27,730
There's footage of you.


2005
01:35:27,730 --> 01:35:29,634
- Well, he deepfaked me.
- What?


2006
01:35:29,634 --> 01:35:31,703
They do it all the time
on the Internet.


2007
01:35:31,703 --> 01:35:34,310
They take Tom Cruise's face,
and they put it on yours.


2008
01:35:34,310 --> 01:35:35,740
And you can't tell
the difference.


2009
01:35:35,739 --> 01:35:37,146
No. Okay, so where's
the real footage


2010
01:35:37,146 --> 01:35:39,117
of Ryder killing Henry?
How do we get it?


2011
01:35:39,117 --> 01:35:41,052
It was on Ryder's phone, and
then it got destroyed because


2012
01:35:41,051 --> 01:35:43,219
Dan's Last of the Mohicans
plan didn't work out. -What?


2013
01:35:43,219 --> 01:35:46,090
It's not his fault, you know?
He called tomahawk first, okay.


2014
01:35:46,090 --> 01:35:47,454
I got "blanks only."


2015
01:35:47,454 --> 01:35:48,719
And it was going
pretty well, actually,


2016
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:50,556
and then Dressler showed up.


2017
01:35:50,555 --> 01:35:53,394
So he, you know, he does this,
like, Jason Bourne shit.


2018
01:35:53,395 --> 01:35:55,968
Okay, I have so many questions.


2019
01:35:55,967 --> 01:35:57,463
Okay.


2020
01:35:57,463 --> 01:35:59,466
Who else knows you're alive?


2021
01:35:59,466 --> 01:36:01,238
- No one.
- Great.


2022
01:36:01,238 --> 01:36:02,909
No, that's the point.
I mean, I figure


2023
01:36:02,909 --> 01:36:04,108
we can't finish the movie
unless they think I'm dead.


2024
01:36:04,108 --> 01:36:05,770
What movie?


2025
01:36:05,770 --> 01:36:06,814
Metalstorm.


2026
01:36:06,814 --> 01:36:08,575
What about Metalstorm?


2027
01:36:08,574 --> 01:36:09,981
If they think I'm dead,
they'll come back and finish.


2028
01:36:09,981 --> 01:36:11,148
- Who?
- Ryder.


2029
01:36:11,148 --> 01:36:12,854
- Finish what?
- The movie.


2030
01:36:12,854 --> 01:36:14,185
- Metalstorm?
- Exactly.


2031
01:36:14,185 --> 01:36:16,021
- Are you insane? You are insane.
- What?


2032
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:17,484
You need to be
burning your fingerprints off,


2033
01:36:17,484 --> 01:36:18,649
and you need to be
getting across the border


2034
01:36:18,649 --> 01:36:20,354
as fast as possible.


2035
01:36:20,354 --> 01:36:22,686
We're gonna hide you
until we can clear your name.


2036
01:36:22,686 --> 01:36:24,623
None of it matters anymore.
It's just a stupid movie.


2037
01:36:24,623 --> 01:36:25,689
- What?
- It's a stupid movie.


2038
01:36:25,689 --> 01:36:27,164
Don't say that.


2039
01:36:27,164 --> 01:36:29,760
That's Metalstorm
you're talking about.


2040
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:32,038
That's the movie you spent
your whole life trying to make.


2041
01:36:32,037 --> 01:36:33,698
Who knows?


2042
01:36:33,698 --> 01:36:35,701
You might inspire a whole
generation of little Jodys


2043
01:36:35,701 --> 01:36:39,011
to pick up cameras
and make their own movies.


2044
01:36:41,015 --> 01:36:43,015
You're just-- you're special.


2045
01:36:44,184 --> 01:36:46,381
And all of us get to be
a part of something special


2046
01:36:46,381 --> 01:36:48,646
because it comes from you.


2047
01:36:48,646 --> 01:36:52,024
I obviously failed
at getting us our happy ending,


2048
01:36:52,024 --> 01:36:53,785
but I'll be damned
if I'm gonna let


2049
01:36:53,784 --> 01:36:55,863
Space Cowboy and Aliena
not have theirs.


2050
01:37:02,166 --> 01:37:03,530
Jody, my love!


2051
01:37:03,530 --> 01:37:04,795
- One sec!
-  I'm coming...


2052
01:37:04,795 --> 01:37:06,203
-  Stop it.


2053
01:37:06,203 --> 01:37:07,731
Gail. She's in on it.


2054
01:37:07,731 --> 01:37:09,404
- What?
- Yes.


2055
01:37:09,404 --> 01:37:11,207
Okay, come on. -Let's just
kiss a little bit first.


2056
01:37:11,207 --> 01:37:13,011
No, come on, we g-- got to get
you in the bathroom, please.


2057
01:37:14,542 --> 01:37:15,772
Come on.


2058
01:37:17,381 --> 01:37:19,150
Come on.


2059
01:37:19,149 --> 01:37:21,646
- Christ!


2060
01:37:21,646 --> 01:37:22,989
Got to work.


2061
01:37:22,989 --> 01:37:24,925
You all right in there,
my darling?


2062
01:37:24,925 --> 01:37:27,389
Here, this-- Take this soap
and rub it on my belly.


2063
01:37:29,261 --> 01:37:30,898
Get in the bedroom.


2064
01:37:30,898 --> 01:37:33,395
- Okay. Colt. Are you good? Okay.
- Okay. Yeah.


2065
01:37:33,395 --> 01:37:35,728
- Be quiet. Don't make a sound.
-Jod?


2066
01:37:35,728 --> 01:37:37,037
- My head. The head.
- What?


2067
01:37:39,533 --> 01:37:41,270
- Hi!
-Hey. Hello, you.


2068
01:37:41,270 --> 01:37:43,503
- Hey. Hey.
- Aw, come here.


2069
01:37:43,503 --> 01:37:44,912
Thank you.


2070
01:37:44,912 --> 01:37:46,341
Aw, how's my favorite director?


2071
01:37:46,341 --> 01:37:47,739
Uh, a bit emotional, you know.


2072
01:37:47,739 --> 01:37:49,246
Oh, no-- Jesus.


2073
01:37:49,247 --> 01:37:50,875
Like Johnny and Amber
have just been here.


2074
01:37:50,875 --> 01:37:52,842
I just need to vent,
'cause it's been...


2075
01:37:52,842 --> 01:37:55,516
- it's just been so much.
- I know. I know.


2076
01:37:55,516 --> 01:37:57,122
- I'm so sorry about Colt.
- Thank you.


2077
01:37:57,122 --> 01:37:59,585
You know, it's such a shame,
but what a mess.


2078
01:37:59,586 --> 01:38:00,961
- Right.
- Who knew?


2079
01:38:00,961 --> 01:38:02,854
- Yeah.
- I mean, I tried to help him.


2080
01:38:02,854 --> 01:38:05,295
I hope you know that, but
sometimes you can't help people


2081
01:38:05,295 --> 01:38:06,757
- who don't want to be saved.
- Right.


2082
01:38:06,757 --> 01:38:09,201
But silver lining


2083
01:38:09,201 --> 01:38:12,237
to this very dark
cloud.


2084
01:38:12,237 --> 01:38:14,074
I've got Ryder to come back.


2085
01:38:14,073 --> 01:38:15,701
- And I have a plan.
- Really?


2086
01:38:15,702 --> 01:38:17,704
But we're not
gonna be able to do


2087
01:38:17,703 --> 01:38:20,574
your big third act set piece,
the car jump.


2088
01:38:20,574 --> 01:38:23,708
It is an impossible jump,
especially now with Colt gone.


2089
01:38:23,708 --> 01:38:25,778
- Dead.
- He's gone.


2090
01:38:25,778 --> 01:38:27,989
- He's so dead.
- Stay with me.


2091
01:38:27,988 --> 01:38:29,484
I spoke to Venti.


2092
01:38:29,484 --> 01:38:31,420
She says that she can do it
in VFX.


2093
01:38:31,420 --> 01:38:32,818
The car jump.


2094
01:38:32,818 --> 01:38:35,094
All we need to focus on
is Ryder's new,


2095
01:38:35,094 --> 01:38:38,591
final, bombastic monologue.


2096
01:38:38,591 --> 01:38:39,966
I've read the pages.


2097
01:38:39,966 --> 01:38:41,462
God, you smashed it.
I knew you would.


2098
01:38:41,462 --> 01:38:43,002
- We're gonna get him covered.
- Yeah.


2099
01:38:43,002 --> 01:38:45,664
You, meanwhile...


2100
01:38:45,666 --> 01:38:48,271
please go and rest up in Fiji,
on me.


2101
01:38:48,271 --> 01:38:51,506
You know?
Plop yourself on a beach.


2102
01:38:51,506 --> 01:38:53,936
And I'm gonna take care
of all of it for you.


2103
01:38:53,936 --> 01:38:54,981
Gail.


2104
01:38:54,981 --> 01:38:56,511
You've got so much to process.


2105
01:38:56,511 --> 01:38:58,250
- No.
- I can take care of all of it.


2106
01:38:58,250 --> 01:39:00,779
No. This is my movie.


2107
01:39:00,779 --> 01:39:02,451
- Now, listen to me.


2108
01:39:02,452 --> 01:39:03,948
I've learned so much from you.


2109
01:39:03,948 --> 01:39:06,621
- I know. Thank you.
- And I'm very grateful.


2110
01:39:06,621 --> 01:39:08,753
But the lesson I stand by now,


2111
01:39:08,753 --> 01:39:10,327
- that you've taught me...
- Yeah. Yeah.


2112
01:39:10,328 --> 01:39:13,958
You fall down,
you get right back up.


2113
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:18,962
I am directing this movie, yeah.


2114
01:39:18,962 --> 01:39:20,469
Oh, my God, that's my girl.


2115
01:39:20,469 --> 01:39:22,373
It went in. I'm so proud
of you. -Good. Okay.


2116
01:39:22,372 --> 01:39:23,934
Thank you. All right,
let's get you out of here.


2117
01:39:23,935 --> 01:39:25,771
- One last thing.
- Yeah?


2118
01:39:25,770 --> 01:39:27,442
Have you seen Dan? -Nope.
I think he's by the taco truck.


2119
01:39:27,444 --> 01:39:28,874
- You haven't heard from him?
- He's probably-probably


2120
01:39:28,873 --> 01:39:30,148
over there somewhere.
Thank you so much.


2121
01:39:30,149 --> 01:39:31,711
- I'm proud of you.
- Thank you.


2122
01:39:31,711 --> 01:39:33,186
Thanks for the pep talk.
Okay, buh-bye. -


2123
01:39:33,185 --> 01:39:34,286
- Love you, darling.
- Love you, too. Bye!


2124
01:39:34,286 --> 01:39:36,188
Oof.


2125
01:39:36,188 --> 01:39:37,717
You're gonna finish the movie.


2126
01:39:37,716 --> 01:39:40,356
No, I'm gonna clear your name.
Okay, now listen.


2127
01:39:40,356 --> 01:39:41,555
Why can't we do both?


2128
01:39:41,555 --> 01:39:42,656
I think we can.


2129
01:39:42,657 --> 01:39:44,460
We're gonna bring him to set,


2130
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:47,497
in a controlled environment,
and then we surround him...


2131
01:39:47,497 --> 01:39:49,960
And we beat the shit out of him.


2132
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:51,466
No.


2133
01:39:51,466 --> 01:39:53,304
We're gonna force
a confession out of him


2134
01:39:53,304 --> 01:39:55,306
by putting him in a scene.


2135
01:39:55,305 --> 01:39:56,901
Right. -You know,
he always forgets he's mic'd.


2136
01:39:56,902 --> 01:39:58,375
That's better.


2137
01:39:58,375 --> 01:39:59,837
I just don't know
how to do it yet.


2138
01:40:03,581 --> 01:40:05,085
I know how to do that.


2139
01:40:07,287 --> 01:40:09,485
Make him do his own stunt.


2140
01:40:09,485 --> 01:40:11,090
The impossible jump.


2141
01:40:11,091 --> 01:40:13,521
Then we beat the shit
out of him.


2142
01:40:13,521 --> 01:40:16,796
One seventy-four,
alpha, take two.


2143
01:40:19,860 --> 01:40:21,166
JODY
And action!


2144
01:40:21,167 --> 01:40:23,269
O-One second, one second,
one second.


2145
01:40:26,032 --> 01:40:27,702
- Action!


2146
01:40:29,670 --> 01:40:31,001
It's high noon


2147
01:40:31,001 --> 01:40:32,905
at the edge of
the universe, folks.


2148
01:40:48,889 --> 01:40:51,891
Now, we're facing
a powerful enemy.


2149
01:40:53,399 --> 01:40:58,061
An alien species born of
the worst of humanity's traits.


2150
01:40:58,061 --> 01:41:01,372
Well, what our enemy doesn't see


2151
01:41:01,372 --> 01:41:04,903
is that their demise
is imminent.


2152
01:41:05,939 --> 01:41:10,845
And the most powerful weapon
in all galaxy?


2153
01:41:13,914 --> 01:41:15,849
Love.


2154
01:41:17,356 --> 01:41:23,956
Inside each and every
one of you is a spark, baby.


2155
01:41:23,956 --> 01:41:25,726
An ember.


2156
01:41:25,726 --> 01:41:28,090
A goddamn fire!


2157
01:41:31,965 --> 01:41:35,065
Love is how we will win.


2158
01:41:35,064 --> 01:41:37,474
And even if we lose,


2159
01:41:37,475 --> 01:41:41,280
we're gonna die
fighting for a happy ending!


2160
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:44,514
- Hell yeah!


2161
01:41:44,514 --> 01:41:46,109
Whoo!


2162
01:41:46,109 --> 01:41:48,112
Well, let's go and get it, then!


2163
01:41:48,112 --> 01:41:51,082
Get on out there and go!


2164
01:41:51,082 --> 01:41:53,986
Who's with me?!
Who is with me?! Let's go!


2165
01:41:53,985 --> 01:41:55,954
Cut! Yes!


2166
01:41:55,954 --> 01:41:57,989
So good, so good.


2167
01:41:57,989 --> 01:41:59,331
- Thank you.
-  Was that it?


2168
01:41:59,332 --> 01:42:00,463
- God, yeah.
- Did we get it?


2169
01:42:00,463 --> 01:42:02,125
- It was so good.
- We got it?


2170
01:42:02,125 --> 01:42:03,533
- Magic. Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah, it was hot, babe.


2171
01:42:03,533 --> 01:42:05,205
Oh, my God. Gail was in floods.


2172
01:42:05,206 --> 01:42:06,867
I really felt that one.
I really felt that one.


2173
01:42:06,867 --> 01:42:08,471
- She was-- Of course you did.
- 'Cause I had tears.


2174
01:42:08,471 --> 01:42:10,034
Of course you did.
Yeah, I know. I can see them.


2175
01:42:10,034 --> 01:42:11,771
-  -
- Yeah, it was fantastic.


2176
01:42:11,771 --> 01:42:14,005
So, listen, all we have left
is the alien truck coverage.


2177
01:42:14,005 --> 01:42:15,447
- All right? That's it.
- No.


2178
01:42:15,447 --> 01:42:17,141
Yep. We're gonna do
the car jump. -No.


2179
01:42:17,140 --> 01:42:18,877
No one told me about
another setup. -We said-- No.


2180
01:42:18,877 --> 01:42:20,648
- There's another setup?
- Venti's gonna do that in VFX,


2181
01:42:20,649 --> 01:42:22,487
so we're out of here. -I know,
but we need his close-up.


2182
01:42:22,487 --> 01:42:24,047
All right? I need his close-up
right here for the coverage.


2183
01:42:24,047 --> 01:42:25,193
All right? 15 minutes tops.
That's all I need.


2184
01:42:25,193 --> 01:42:26,788
This is the bit,
do you remember,


2185
01:42:26,787 --> 01:42:28,458
where Space Cowboy steals
the alien vehicle? -Hmm.


2186
01:42:28,458 --> 01:42:29,855
- Come on. This is his moment.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.


2187
01:42:29,855 --> 01:42:31,198
I'm not gonna do
any driving, right?


2188
01:42:31,198 --> 01:42:32,792
Because I'm gonna feel
really nauseous.


2189
01:42:32,792 --> 01:42:34,058
It's a blue screen setup.


2190
01:42:34,059 --> 01:42:36,204
I need this. I need this, okay?


2191
01:42:37,195 --> 01:42:38,634
Zero notice here.


2192
01:42:38,634 --> 01:42:40,668
We're moving as fast
as we can, all right?


2193
01:42:40,668 --> 01:42:43,573
Everyone, double the pace, yes?!


2194
01:42:43,573 --> 01:42:45,872
Use those muscles!
Yes, good! Thank you!


2195
01:42:50,582 --> 01:42:53,175
Everyone in position!


2196
01:42:53,176 --> 01:42:55,046
Light the pyro!


2197
01:42:56,291 --> 01:43:00,657
We need enough charges to blow
this canyon sky-high, people.


2198
01:43:00,657 --> 01:43:02,362
NIGEL
McCabe, where are we?


2199
01:43:02,362 --> 01:43:03,693
Going as fast as I can, Nige.


2200
01:43:03,693 --> 01:43:05,023
We're as ready as we can be.


2201
01:43:05,023 --> 01:43:06,563
Okay. Hey, get Ray to come in


2202
01:43:06,563 --> 01:43:08,500
and check the mic
before we go, okay? -Copy.


2203
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:11,270
Sound, can you come down here
and check Ryder's mic, please?


2204
01:43:16,377 --> 01:43:17,937
All right, Tom. You ready?


2205
01:43:17,936 --> 01:43:19,609
- Yeah.
- Okay. Remember this bit?


2206
01:43:19,609 --> 01:43:20,840
You're gonna be in
the alien vehicle. -Mm-hmm.


2207
01:43:20,841 --> 01:43:21,909
- Okay? Okay.
- Yep.


2208
01:43:21,908 --> 01:43:23,250
And with nowhere to go,


2209
01:43:23,250 --> 01:43:24,582
you're gonna jump the car
over the ravine.


2210
01:43:24,582 --> 01:43:26,418
So I just need
a quick pop on you...


2211
01:43:26,417 --> 01:43:28,045
Space Cowboy
ain't scared of no ravine.


2212
01:43:28,046 --> 01:43:29,916
- Of course he's not.
- So I'm thinking maybe just


2213
01:43:29,916 --> 01:43:31,213
a couple of reaction shots
of me gritting my teeth. -Yeah.


2214
01:43:31,213 --> 01:43:32,082
Like, "Goddamn."
Something like that.


2215
01:43:32,082 --> 01:43:33,457
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Stoic.


2216
01:43:33,457 --> 01:43:34,789
- Yeah, yeah. I like it.
- All right?


2217
01:43:34,789 --> 01:43:36,461
- What do you think?
- I like it. Okay.


2218
01:43:36,461 --> 01:43:37,561
I think it's gonna be great.
Yeah, I love the choice.


2219
01:43:37,561 --> 01:43:38,859
All right, let's pop these on.


2220
01:43:38,859 --> 01:43:40,464
- Okay. What's this?
- There you go.


2221
01:43:40,465 --> 01:43:41,863
No, this is because
you've escaped the aliens.


2222
01:43:41,863 --> 01:43:43,194
Is this necessary?
It's a bit much, no?


2223
01:43:43,194 --> 01:43:44,030
Yeah. It looks cool.
Raise the stakes.


2224
01:43:44,029 --> 01:43:45,768
It's kind of cool.


2225
01:43:45,768 --> 01:43:47,373
- Yeah. It's cool. Okay.
- Raise the stakes.


2226
01:43:47,373 --> 01:43:48,572
- Let's do it.
- 'Cause you know, Space Cowboy.


2227
01:43:48,573 --> 01:43:50,376
Nobody can get at
the Space Cowboy.


2228
01:43:50,376 --> 01:43:52,070
- No way. Even when he's cuffed.
- Excuse me. Tom, sorry.


2229
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:53,708
Jesus, Ray. I told you
to do it before I got on set.


2230
01:43:53,708 --> 01:43:55,414
- Appreciate you, Tom.


2231
01:43:55,414 --> 01:43:56,416
Thank you. Sound good.


2232
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:57,646
- Okay.
- Okay, great.


2233
01:43:57,646 --> 01:43:59,110
- So...
- So...


2234
01:43:59,110 --> 01:44:00,418
You got this guy
coming on your left. -Yep.


2235
01:44:00,418 --> 01:44:01,980
- Hey, bro.
- All right, take him out.


2236
01:44:01,980 --> 01:44:02,981
Someone else is gonna
crash down on the bonnet.


2237
01:44:02,981 --> 01:44:04,654
You're gonna take him out.


2238
01:44:04,654 --> 01:44:06,393
No, no, no. See, what I'm
thinking is maybe I come down,


2239
01:44:06,393 --> 01:44:08,988
I take him out first,
and I'm like "pow, pow, pow."


2240
01:44:08,988 --> 01:44:11,055
- I slide over and go "pow."
- Yeah. Yeah.


2241
01:44:11,055 --> 01:44:12,893
And then maybe I say
a little line like,


2242
01:44:12,894 --> 01:44:15,996
"I was shooting aliens
way before I was paid to."


2243
01:44:15,996 --> 01:44:18,063
Fantastic.
All right, let's lock it up.


2244
01:44:18,063 --> 01:44:20,065
- Let's shoot, Nigel.
-Standing by, please.


2245
01:44:20,064 --> 01:44:21,165
All right.


2246
01:44:21,166 --> 01:44:22,574
Take one. Marker.


2247
01:44:22,573 --> 01:44:25,971
In three, two, one, action.


2248
01:44:27,270 --> 01:44:28,843
Not your lucky day, alien.


2249
01:44:28,842 --> 01:44:30,614
You got to go.


2250
01:44:31,684 --> 01:44:32,782
You can't outrun me.


2251
01:44:32,782 --> 01:44:35,323
I'm Space Cowboy!


2252
01:44:35,323 --> 01:44:36,456
Yahoo!


2253
01:44:36,456 --> 01:44:38,248
You are approaching the ravine.


2254
01:44:38,248 --> 01:44:39,457
There's nowhere else to go.


2255
01:44:39,457 --> 01:44:41,250
- Turn right. Go on.


2256
01:44:41,251 --> 01:44:42,592
You have no choice.


2257
01:44:42,592 --> 01:44:43,594
You're gonna
have to make the jump.


2258
01:44:43,594 --> 01:44:46,596
In three, two, one.


2259
01:44:46,596 --> 01:44:49,929
Yeehaw!


2260
01:44:49,930 --> 01:44:51,470
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, hey, hey, hey.


2261
01:44:51,470 --> 01:44:53,099
Who is that in the car with him?


2262
01:44:53,099 --> 01:44:55,770
We're-we're in the middle
of a take right now, asshole.


2263
01:44:55,770 --> 01:44:57,608
What are you doing? Ah!


2264
01:44:57,608 --> 01:44:59,676
He's just buckling you in.
Safety first. That's it. -Ow!


2265
01:44:59,676 --> 01:45:01,976
It's really tight.
Is this necessary?


2266
01:45:01,975 --> 01:45:04,009
Hey, we are filming right now.


2267
01:45:04,010 --> 01:45:06,177
Keep rolling, keep rolling.


2268
01:45:06,176 --> 01:45:07,618
Sell it, Tom. It looks amazing.
Take a deep breath.


2269
01:45:07,618 --> 01:45:09,817
It does not look--
Get out of the car.


2270
01:45:11,020 --> 01:45:12,216
Howdy.


2271
01:45:12,216 --> 01:45:14,186
- No, no, wait. Stop. No.


2272
01:45:15,155 --> 01:45:16,220
Wait, what's happening?


2273
01:45:16,220 --> 01:45:18,124
Yeehaw!


2274
01:45:18,123 --> 01:45:20,323
Oh, my God! Whoa!


2275
01:45:20,323 --> 01:45:22,567
Get to the cars!


2276
01:45:25,537 --> 01:45:27,230
Jody, what the hell
are you doing?!


2277
01:45:27,230 --> 01:45:28,231
I'm trying to get something
real out of him, Gail.


2278
01:45:28,231 --> 01:45:29,541
There's no cameras on him!


2279
01:45:31,777 --> 01:45:34,810
Hey, Dan? They're approaching
Ambush Alley right now.


2280
01:45:34,810 --> 01:45:36,076
We're ready.


2281
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:40,585
Let me out right now!


2282
01:45:40,585 --> 01:45:43,654
What are you gonna do, huh?
You gonna kill me? Again?!


2283
01:45:48,627 --> 01:45:50,792
- Can you untie me?
- No.


2284
01:45:57,262 --> 01:45:58,867
McCabe!


2285
01:45:58,868 --> 01:46:02,443
Smoke screen in three, two, one!


2286
01:46:02,443 --> 01:46:04,368
Whoa!


2287
01:46:04,368 --> 01:46:06,303
This does not seem safe, man!


2288
01:46:11,783 --> 01:46:14,519
Dan, where are they?
Do you have eyes on them?


2289
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:16,820
I see 'em.
Everything's going to plan.


2290
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:21,427
I'll block the road.


2291
01:46:21,427 --> 01:46:23,287
They shall not pass!


2292
01:46:23,287 --> 01:46:26,091
I see them.
They're entering Ambush Alley.


2293
01:46:30,737 --> 01:46:32,439
I can't see shit!


2294
01:46:34,234 --> 01:46:36,234
McCabe, one!


2295
01:46:37,171 --> 01:46:39,512
McCabe, two!


2296
01:46:42,978 --> 01:46:44,748
McCabe! Now!


2297
01:46:54,859 --> 01:46:56,429
I love my job.


2298
01:47:00,766 --> 01:47:04,570
Whoa, mama!


2299
01:47:04,570 --> 01:47:06,903
Oh, goddamn!


2300
01:47:06,903 --> 01:47:09,432
I can't think straight when
you drive like this. -


2301
01:47:09,432 --> 01:47:10,939
You're supposed to be dead.


2302
01:47:10,939 --> 01:47:14,008
You blew up
in-in a thousand pieces.


2303
01:47:14,007 --> 01:47:15,338
You went kaboom.


2304
01:47:15,338 --> 01:47:17,979
Why would I have blown up,
Tom Ryder?


2305
01:47:17,979 --> 01:47:20,279
Why are you saying my name
like that?


2306
01:47:20,279 --> 01:47:21,983
That is your name,
isn't it, Tom Ryder? -Yes, yes.


2307
01:47:21,983 --> 01:47:23,490
A blind man could see
that you're


2308
01:47:23,490 --> 01:47:25,020
- Tom Ryder.
- You're saying that like...


2309
01:47:25,020 --> 01:47:26,592
-  "Ryder, Tom Ryder."
- Okay. That's me.


2310
01:47:26,591 --> 01:47:27,856
You're saying it like
some obsessed fangirl.


2311
01:47:27,856 --> 01:47:29,354
That's me, Colt Seavers,
saying that.


2312
01:47:29,354 --> 01:47:30,926
Roll the cameras.
We're heading for the jump.


2313
01:47:30,926 --> 01:47:32,159
Tom Ryder's
doing his own stunts!


2314
01:47:32,158 --> 01:47:33,996
Everyone, roll. Arm car?


2315
01:47:33,996 --> 01:47:35,260
Check.


2316
01:47:35,260 --> 01:47:36,635
- Heli.
-Check.


2317
01:47:36,635 --> 01:47:38,164
I'm done taking the falls
for you.


2318
01:47:38,164 --> 01:47:39,802
You're gonna do your own stunts
from now on.


2319
01:47:39,802 --> 01:47:41,365
I don't want to do
my own stunts, Colt! -Relax.


2320
01:47:41,365 --> 01:47:43,434
It's just a 250-foot jump
that'll probably kill us.


2321
01:47:43,434 --> 01:47:45,975
It's never been done before.
It's for Comic-Con.


2322
01:47:45,975 --> 01:47:48,945
- It's Hall H. It's a big deal.
- What are you doing, man?


2323
01:47:48,944 --> 01:47:50,340
I thought it'd be fitting.


2324
01:47:50,341 --> 01:47:52,685
Me and you, Tom Ryder,
one last stunt.


2325
01:47:52,685 --> 01:47:54,884
You know,
like Thelma and Louise.


2326
01:47:54,884 --> 01:47:56,820
- Thelma and Louise?
- Yeah.


2327
01:47:56,820 --> 01:47:59,052
- They die at the end.
- Exactly!


2328
01:47:59,052 --> 01:48:00,957
Murder-suicide.


2329
01:48:00,957 --> 01:48:02,925
Can you just pull over
and let me out right now?


2330
01:48:04,225 --> 01:48:06,698
You're not getting
out of this car until you,


2331
01:48:06,698 --> 01:48:09,128
Tom Ryder, tell me,
Colt Seavers, the truth!


2332
01:48:09,128 --> 01:48:10,229
All right, all right,
all right, all right!


2333
01:48:10,229 --> 01:48:11,802
It was all Gail.


2334
01:48:11,801 --> 01:48:13,804
When I killed Henry,
she wanted to cover it up


2335
01:48:13,804 --> 01:48:15,333
because, to be honest,


2336
01:48:15,332 --> 01:48:17,840
Space Cowboy's one of
my best roles yet, Colt,


2337
01:48:17,841 --> 01:48:19,502
and I don't want
this movie to fail.


2338
01:48:19,502 --> 01:48:21,173
So you're saying that Gail Meyer


2339
01:48:21,173 --> 01:48:24,243
was responsible for framing me
for your murder of Henry?


2340
01:48:24,243 --> 01:48:26,145
Yes! Yes!


2341
01:48:26,145 --> 01:48:27,916
But what's your real name?


2342
01:48:27,917 --> 01:48:29,523
Tom Ryder.


2343
01:48:30,591 --> 01:48:32,019
Did you get that, Jody?


2344
01:48:32,020 --> 01:48:34,418
We got it! He confessed.


2345
01:48:34,417 --> 01:48:36,057
You wearing a wire?
Bro, you recording this?


2346
01:48:36,057 --> 01:48:37,761
This is entrapment.
You can't do that.


2347
01:48:37,761 --> 01:48:39,390
- What are you doing?
- No, it's not entrapment,


2348
01:48:39,390 --> 01:48:41,963
because you're wearing
the wire, dipshit!


2349
01:48:46,068 --> 01:48:47,398
He's going for it. Go. Go now.


2350
01:48:47,398 --> 01:48:48,905
I'm just an actor!


2351
01:48:48,905 --> 01:48:50,203
Wait.


2352
01:48:50,203 --> 01:48:52,041
He has a mouth guard.


2353
01:48:52,041 --> 01:48:54,614
I don't have a mouth guard.


2354
01:49:42,456 --> 01:49:44,422
- Oh, good.
-Colt!


2355
01:49:44,421 --> 01:49:46,896
- You're alive.
- Are you okay?


2356
01:49:48,261 --> 01:49:49,736
Are you okay?


2357
01:49:49,735 --> 01:49:51,461
I told you
I'd make the camera up to you.


2358
01:49:51,462 --> 01:49:53,267
Oh, it was fantastic.


2359
01:49:53,266 --> 01:49:54,938
GAIL
Dressler, come in! -Ah!


2360
01:49:54,938 --> 01:49:57,568
Oy, can you hear me?
We've got to get out of here!


2361
01:49:57,568 --> 01:49:58,909
RYDER
This is all Gail's fault, man.


2362
01:49:58,909 --> 01:50:00,503
This is all Gail's idea.


2363
01:50:00,503 --> 01:50:01,912
-Give me that confession!
-  No.


2364
01:50:01,912 --> 01:50:03,782
Give me all the media!
Are you deaf?!


2365
01:50:03,783 --> 01:50:06,752
Dressler, bring
the helicopter to the trench.


2366
01:50:06,752 --> 01:50:07,952
- What about Ryder?
- Now!


2367
01:50:07,952 --> 01:50:09,579
Now, about this date.


2368
01:50:09,579 --> 01:50:12,153
Put it in the case, you numpty!


2369
01:50:12,154 --> 01:50:13,485
Can we call it a date?


2370
01:50:13,484 --> 01:50:16,519
I mean,
that's what it is, right?


2371
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:17,631
Such a moron!


2372
01:50:18,557 --> 01:50:21,493
- Hurry up! God!
-  -Take it.


2373
01:50:21,493 --> 01:50:23,330
- Gail, Gail, Gail.


2374
01:50:23,329 --> 01:50:25,430
- Listen...
- Give me the recording, Gail.


2375
01:50:25,430 --> 01:50:28,334
Darling, calm down.
Just come with me.


2376
01:50:28,333 --> 01:50:30,841
We don't need
all this toxic masculinity,


2377
01:50:30,841 --> 01:50:32,271
because we're the same,
you and me.


2378
01:50:32,271 --> 01:50:34,109
You know, we're survivors.


2379
01:50:34,109 --> 01:50:35,846
No, no, no, no.
I'm nothing like you.


2380
01:50:35,846 --> 01:50:38,311
I don't want to be
presumptuous, I mean,


2381
01:50:38,311 --> 01:50:41,018
but let's call a spade a spade.


2382
01:50:41,018 --> 01:50:42,854
That's why I gave you the job.


2383
01:50:42,854 --> 01:50:44,351
- Okay.
- Well, that and because


2384
01:50:44,350 --> 01:50:47,661
you're so easily moldable,
you know?


2385
01:50:48,520 --> 01:50:51,027
- Oh!
- Gail, just give me the case!


2386
01:50:51,028 --> 01:50:52,896
This is a Gail Meyer production!


2387
01:50:52,896 --> 01:50:54,524
Not yours!


2388
01:50:54,524 --> 01:50:56,659
Rendezvous with the boss
in the canyon.


2389
01:50:56,659 --> 01:50:57,967
Extraction to the spaceship set.


2390
01:50:57,967 --> 01:50:59,662
Spaceship set?


2391
01:50:59,662 --> 01:51:02,203
Oh, no, Big Red.


2392
01:51:02,203 --> 01:51:04,206
I don't think
you're gonna make that one.


2393
01:51:04,206 --> 01:51:06,538
- Stunts set!
-Stunts set!


2394
01:51:06,537 --> 01:51:08,748
- Go!


2395
01:51:21,421 --> 01:51:24,027
Trust me, I will not
be taking the fall for this,


2396
01:51:24,028 --> 01:51:29,099
because I deliver hits
for all you little people.


2397
01:51:29,099 --> 01:51:30,166
You're welcome.


2398
01:51:30,166 --> 01:51:33,235
- Whoa!


2399
01:51:33,234 --> 01:51:34,532
Jody?


2400
01:51:37,636 --> 01:51:40,374
Jody? -RYDER: Hey, hey!
That's for me! That's for me!


2401
01:51:40,373 --> 01:51:42,078
- That's my helicopter!


2402
01:51:42,078 --> 01:51:44,784
This crazy stuntman's
lost his mind!


2403
01:51:58,625 --> 01:51:59,963
I'm on vacation!


2404
01:52:13,307 --> 01:52:15,440
Get this dog off me!
Not again, dog.


2405
01:52:16,819 --> 01:52:18,016
- Just stay there!


2406
01:52:19,118 --> 01:52:21,854
Night-night, dog! You're dead.


2407
01:52:32,658 --> 01:52:35,262
This design is growing on me.


2408
01:52:36,662 --> 01:52:40,168
Get in! Let's get out of here!


2409
01:52:40,168 --> 01:52:41,774
Yeah, copy that.
Taking off now.


2410
01:52:43,305 --> 01:52:44,734
Wait, what-what is this?


2411
01:52:44,734 --> 01:52:46,076
It's the evidence!


2412
01:52:46,077 --> 01:52:47,914
Why didn't you just
stop talking?!


2413
01:52:47,913 --> 01:52:49,310
Jody!


2414
01:52:49,310 --> 01:52:51,411
Blow the pyros. Blow the pyros!


2415
01:52:51,412 --> 01:52:53,117
They're getting away!


2416
01:52:56,990 --> 01:52:59,023
- Whoa! Sh-- Whoa!
- Holy shit!


2417
01:52:59,023 --> 01:53:01,454
- Lower the arm! I'm gonna jump.
- Okay.


2418
01:53:01,454 --> 01:53:03,555
Okay, lower the arm.
Lower the arm.


2419
01:53:07,627 --> 01:53:09,496
I have a plan!


2420
01:53:09,496 --> 01:53:11,431
What is it?
What's-what's the plan?


2421
01:53:11,430 --> 01:53:12,464
Get me to the helicopter.


2422
01:53:12,465 --> 01:53:13,939
I'm gonna jump onto the skids,


2423
01:53:13,939 --> 01:53:14,974
and then I'm gonna
beat the shit out of him.


2424
01:53:14,974 --> 01:53:16,337
No, just-just get the recording.


2425
01:53:30,551 --> 01:53:31,826
Go!


2426
01:53:32,421 --> 01:53:33,520
Ah, shit.


2427
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:34,829
Go!


2428
01:53:35,896 --> 01:53:38,524
Whoa! Whoa! Get me down!


2429
01:53:38,524 --> 01:53:40,229
Whoa! Get me down!


2430
01:53:40,229 --> 01:53:41,494
We're losing hydraulics here.


2431
01:53:41,494 --> 01:53:42,693
I can't get it under control.


2432
01:53:43,905 --> 01:53:45,630
Just wondering,
you know, after this movie,


2433
01:53:45,630 --> 01:53:48,632
and if I don't go to prison
and, you know, you're not busy,


2434
01:53:48,632 --> 01:53:50,304
maybe we could go
to a beach somewhere.


2435
01:53:50,305 --> 01:53:52,704
Wear a couple of
swimming costumes.


2436
01:53:52,703 --> 01:53:54,880
Just drink a spicy margarita
or something.


2437
01:53:54,881 --> 01:53:57,146
Yeah, yeah.
Make some bad decisions. -Yeah.


2438
01:53:57,146 --> 01:53:58,742
Okay, sure. Yes.


2439
01:53:58,743 --> 01:54:00,349
- Sound like a plan?
- It's a better plan than this.


2440
01:54:00,349 --> 01:54:02,481
Okay, please be careful.


2441
01:54:02,481 --> 01:54:04,122
Okay, swing him around. Go!


2442
01:54:21,470 --> 01:54:23,570
God, get it under control!


2443
01:54:23,569 --> 01:54:25,768
Get us out of here!
What are you doing?!


2444
01:54:31,841 --> 01:54:33,678
Ryder, the confession!


2445
01:54:33,677 --> 01:54:35,086
No!


2446
01:54:35,086 --> 01:54:37,088
- No! No, Gail, no!
-  -No, Gail!


2447
01:54:39,551 --> 01:54:41,158
Whoa! Whoa!


2448
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:44,689
Stunts!


2449
01:54:44,689 --> 01:54:46,856
Mobilize that airbag now!


2450
01:54:46,855 --> 01:54:48,198
No!


2451
01:54:51,666 --> 01:54:53,500
Get out of the way, Ryder!


2452
01:54:55,769 --> 01:54:58,208
87North to the rescue!


2453
01:54:58,207 --> 01:54:59,978
- Go, go, go, go!
- Go!


2454
01:54:59,979 --> 01:55:01,838
Move, move, move!


2455
01:55:03,413 --> 01:55:04,576
Get it!


2456
01:55:06,680 --> 01:55:08,251
- Just keep it steady!


2457
01:55:09,483 --> 01:55:10,923
You moron!


2458
01:55:20,297 --> 01:55:22,694
Yes! Nice!


2459
01:55:26,006 --> 01:55:27,765
Go, go, go!


2460
01:55:39,119 --> 01:55:40,988
- Yes!


2461
01:55:41,947 --> 01:55:43,287
- Oh, God!
- Oh, shit!


2462
01:55:46,555 --> 01:55:48,291
No!


2463
01:55:48,291 --> 01:55:50,029
Grab it!


2464
01:55:51,293 --> 01:55:52,493
Oh, my God! My nose!


2465
01:55:56,466 --> 01:55:59,237
- No! Ryder, the gun!


2466
01:56:05,079 --> 01:56:06,671
Shoot him!
He's a stupid stuntman!


2467
01:56:06,671 --> 01:56:08,311
No one gives a shit!


2468
01:56:08,311 --> 01:56:10,610
He's one of the best
stunt doubles I've ever had!


2469
01:56:10,610 --> 01:56:13,546
Oh, shut up!
Give me the confession!


2470
01:56:13,546 --> 01:56:15,548
Come on, come on, come on!
Quick!


2471
01:56:15,548 --> 01:56:17,386

2472
