你看，那不是我的下巴。
As you can see, that is not my chin.

62
00:02:47,848 --> 00:02:51,753
当你看我的脸，看我的下巴和他的相比，就像他的下巴掉了一样。
When you look at my face, look at my jaw compared to his jaw, it's like his chin is off.

63
00:02:51,753 --> 00:02:52,919

I don't know, man. Do you think, um... Try and make some magic?

72
00:03:11,905 --> 00:03:13,940
也许你可以倒着做什么的?我不知道。
Maybe you could do it backwards or something? I don't know.

00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,107
-只是…更少的脸。-是的。
- It's just... less face. - Yeah.

The woman freebasing the Diet Coke is Tom's producer Gail.

She's been making him look good for years. -Thank you.

76
00:03:21,178 --> 00:03:22,718
这并不总是那么容易。-好吧。
-And it's not always easy. - All right.

77
00:03:22,718 --> 00:03:25,424
-给我一些。——哦!我要…我没什么可抱怨的。
- Give me some. - - Oh! I'm gonna... I can't complain.

- I'm living the dream. - He wants to go again.

83
00:03:33,597 --> 00:03:35,368

Copy that, Colt. We'll flip the rig. -Thank you.

84
00:03:35,368 --> 00:03:37,029
你会向后倒。
You'll be falling backwards.

87

88
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:47,237
嗯,是的。刚才看起来你好像想问我什么。——哦。
Uh, yeah. It just looked just now like you wanted to ask me something. - Oh.

89
00:03:47,237 --> 00:03:49,415
下班后我想去喝一杯辣玛格丽塔。
I was gonna go for a spicy margarita after work.

90
00:03:49,415 --> 00:03:51,318
我想知道你喝不喝辣的玛格丽塔酒。
I was wondering if you drink spicy margaritas.

91
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,951
为了专业起见，我只能喝一杯辣玛格丽塔。
Um, well, just to keep it professional, I can only have one spicy margarita.

92
00:03:57,951 --> 00:04:00,954
因为如果我有两个，我就会做出错误的决定。
Because if I have two, I start making bad decisions.

93
00:04:00,954 --> 00:04:05,596
你知道，喝玛格丽塔酒会让你做出错误的决定。
Well, you know, drinking margaritas is all about making bad decisions.

94
00:04:05,596 --> 00:04:13,670
这倒提醒了我，工作结束后，我要去沙滩上坐一坐，我在想…我想问你个问题。
Which reminds me, um, after this job, I-I got to go sit on the sand somewhere, and I was wondering, uh... I was gonna ask you a question.

是的，我有一些毛巾。

98
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,240
你知道，一个人游泳太危险了。
You know, it's so dangerous to swim alone.

99
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:29,147
我想请你做我的游泳伙伴，但我不知道你有没有泳衣。
Well, I would ask you to, you know, be my swim buddy, but I don't know if you have a bathing suit.

100
00:04:29,147 --> 00:04:32,524

Wait a second. What do you call that across the pond?

101
00:04:32,524 --> 00:04:35,461

After this, you and I could both be on the beach somewhere in swimming costumes drinking spicy margaritas, - making bad decisions. -Okay, good to go.

你没事吧?-好吧，带他去医院吧。
You all right? -All right, let's take him to ones.

109
00:05:05,524 --> 00:05:08,725

- Tail slate. -Going to ones. - Go ahead and sit back for me.

110

-走到边缘。-《绝技》很热门。
- And going out to the edge. - Stunts is hot.

112
00:05:13,664 --> 00:05:15,897
-把绳子拉紧。-我们在上面怎么样了，特技演员?
- Take up the slack. - How we doing up there, stunt?

113
00:05:15,897 --> 00:05:18,900
——太棒了。他的伟大。开始吧。-位置下降。
- Great. He's great. Here we go. - Position down.

114
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:21,771
他喝醉了。
He's at ones.

115
00:05:23,368 --> 00:05:24,840
准备好给我留言了吗?
Ready to drop the line for me?

116

119
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:43,254
柯尔特，你还好吗?
Colt, are you okay?

120
00:05:43,254 --> 00:05:44,728
我需要你退后。
I need you to step back.

121
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:46,697
你在帮倒忙。
You're not helping.

122
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,850
“骄者必败”这句话是什么意思?
What's that saying, "Pride comes before the fall"?

123
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,722
他们也没提到它会在之后继续存在。
Well, they don't mention that it sticks around afterwards, too.

124
00:06:13,383 --> 00:06:15,385
乔迪很努力地陪在我身边。
Jody tried so hard to be there for me.

125
00:06:15,385 --> 00:06:18,762
她真的做到了。我只是…我做不到。
She really did. I just... I couldn't do it.

126
00:06:21,633 --> 00:06:23,965
然后我就完全消失了。
Then I just disappeared completely.

127
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:30,334
嗯…-至少我以为我知道。
Well... - at least I thought I did.

128
00:06:39,585 --> 00:06:40,586
喂?
Hello?

129
00:06:40,586 --> 00:06:42,555
哦!小马!
Oh! Colt!

130
00:06:42,555 --> 00:06:44,150
盖尔。
It's Gail.

131
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,790
-你最喜欢的制作人。-你怎么知道这个号码的?
- Your favorite producer. - How'd you get this number?

132
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:50,123
有人说你在船长的鹦鹉酒吧工作。
Someone said you were working at the Captain's Cockatoo.

133
00:06:50,123 --> 00:06:51,256
一个管家。
A valet.

134
00:06:51,256 --> 00:06:53,467
哇!我简直不敢相信。
Wow! I didn't believe it.

135
00:06:53,467 --> 00:06:56,503
实际上是El Cacatúa del Capitan。
It's actually El Cacatúa del Capitan.

136
00:06:56,503 --> 00:06:59,396
这是一个家庭经营的地方。我们分享小费。
It's a family-run place. We pool tips.

137
00:07:01,508 --> 00:07:04,005
而且，我能吃多少卷饼就吃多少。
Plus, I get all the burritos I can eat.

138
00:07:04,005 --> 00:07:05,908
如果你仔细想想，这就像是在实现梦想。
Kind of living the dream if you think about it.

139
00:07:05,908 --> 00:07:08,273
休息时间结束了。你有客户了。
Break time's over. You've got a customer.

140
00:07:08,273 --> 00:07:09,747
43号。
Number 43.

141
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,816
-嗨。
- Hey.

142
00:07:14,622 --> 00:07:16,919
兄弟，我在哪儿见过你。
Yo, bro, I know you from somewhere.

143
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:18,624
我在哪见过你，兄弟?
Where I know you from, bro?

144
00:07:18,624 --> 00:07:22,089
对了，你演了我演的汤姆·莱德的电影。
Oh, yeah, you were on that Tom Ryder movie I was on.

145
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:24,289
-你是特技演员!-不再是了。
- You're the stunt guy! - Not anymore.

146
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:27,028
你是摔断了背还是怎么的?-是的。
Did you, like, break your back or some shit? -I did, yeah.

147
00:07:27,028 --> 00:07:31,197
我知道你过得不容易，自从…这一事件。
I know things haven't been easy for you since... the incident.

148
00:07:31,197 --> 00:07:35,839
我只希望你不要因此对我和汤姆产生反感。
And I just hope that you don't hold it against me or Tom.

149
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:38,303
你知道，我们完全崩溃了。
You know, we were absolutely devastated.

150
00:07:38,303 --> 00:07:39,711
他给你捎了个口信，对吧?
He sent you a message, right?

151
00:07:42,144 --> 00:07:43,440
祈祷之手的表情符号?
The prayer hands emoji?

152
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,014
对,是的。他还是个混蛋。
Right, yeah. He's still an asshole.

153
00:07:46,014 --> 00:07:47,851
你怎么还活着?哟,美女。
How are you even still alive? Yo, babe.

154
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:49,556
-宝贝，过来。-我不知道。
- Babe, hey, come here. - I don't know.

155
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:50,854
-我希望我现在不是。-你得见见这个人。
- I wish I wasn't right now. - You got to meet this guy.

156
00:07:50,854 --> 00:07:52,350
到这里来。你得听听这个。
Come here. You got to hear this.

157
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,220
你没必要听这些。它很好。嗨。
You don't have to hear this. It's fine. Hi.

158
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,793
这家伙演过一部我演过的电影。
This dude was on a movie I was on.

159
00:07:55,793 --> 00:07:59,896
-这是我见过的最史诗般的失败。毫米。
- Most epic fail I've ever seen. -Mm.

160
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,568
我不怪你们俩，盖尔。
I don't blame either one of you, Gail.

161
00:08:01,568 --> 00:08:03,064
那是我的错。
That was my fault.

162
00:08:03,064 --> 00:08:06,298
当你开始犯这样的错误时，是时候把护垫挂起来了。
And when you start making mistakes like that, it's time to hang up the pads.

163
00:08:06,298 --> 00:08:08,003
那是个意外，柯尔特。
Oh, it was an accident, Colt.

164
00:08:08,003 --> 00:08:10,137
每个人都知道。
Everybody knows that.

165
00:08:10,137 --> 00:08:14,504
汤姆让我陷入了真正的困境，科特。
Tom has put me in a real situation here, Colt.

166
00:08:14,504 --> 00:08:21,819
我只是需要一个老朋友的一点帮助，他恰好是，你知道，我这辈子合作过的最好的特技演员。
I just need a little bit of help from an old friend, who just happens to be, you know, the best stuntman I've ever worked with in my life.

167
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:25,823
所以你明天要替我搭飞机去悉尼。
Which is why you are getting on a plane for me tomorrow and coming to Sydney.

168
00:08:25,823 --> 00:08:27,561
我不坐飞机，盖尔。
I'm not getting on a plane, Gail.

169
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:29,563
我不能忍受你放弃所有的才华。
I can't bear that you would throw away all that talent.

170
00:08:29,563 --> 00:08:31,994
你不该停车，科特。
You shouldn't be parking cars, Colt.

171
00:08:31,994 --> 00:08:35,899
你得把燃烧的川崎弹砸穿玻璃。
You need to be smashing burning Kawasakis through panes of glass.

172
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:38,264
喂，替死鬼?哟。
Yo, fall guy? Yo.

173
00:08:38,264 --> 00:08:43,577
把我的车毫发无损地开回来，我给你买了块脆皮的，兄弟。
Bring my car back without a scratch, I got a crispy fiver here for you, bro.

174
00:09:05,964 --> 00:09:08,063
来吧。就像以前一样。
Come on. It's gonna be like old times.

175
00:09:08,063 --> 00:09:09,735
我知道你很想念它。
I know you've missed it.

176
00:09:09,735 --> 00:09:11,066
再见,盖尔。
Goodbye, Gail.

177
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:13,068
等等，等等，等等!等待。等一等。
Wait, wait, wait! Wait. Hold on.

178
00:09:13,068 --> 00:09:16,907
我有没有告诉过你，我有没有告诉过你局长特别要见你?
Did I, did I tell you-- I-- Did I tell you that the director's asked for you specifically?

179
00:09:16,907 --> 00:09:18,535
抱歉让他失望了。
Sorry to disappoint him.

180
00:09:18,535 --> 00:09:20,438
你不想知道是谁吗?不。
Well, don't you want to know who it is? -Nope.

嗯，这是新技术。
Eh, it's new technology.

基本上，我们用你脸的几何形状来重新定位赖德的脸，然后把赖德的脸放回你的脸上。

217
00:11:38,787 --> 00:11:41,282
嘿，欢迎来到悉尼。你是柯尔特·西弗斯吗?
Hey, welcome to Sydney. Are you Colt Seavers?

218
00:11:41,282 --> 00:11:43,757
是的。嘿。你知道我在哪里可以买到咖啡吗?
Yeah. Hey. Do you know where I can get some coffee?

219
00:11:43,757 --> 00:11:45,517
时差反应太严重了。
This jet lag is really kicking in.

220
00:11:45,517 --> 00:11:46,892
是的，没有压力。我抓住你了。
Yeah, no stress. I got you.

221
00:11:46,892 --> 00:11:48,762
导演知道我在这里吗?
And does the director know I'm here?

222
00:11:48,762 --> 00:11:51,259
-她找我——嗯…她是想打招呼还是…?
- She asked for me. - Uh... Does-does she want to say hi or...?

223
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:53,228
我还没听说。不，抱歉，兄弟。
I haven't heard. No, sorry, bro.

224
00:11:53,228 --> 00:11:54,966
但是特技协调员要见你。
Uh, but the stunt coordinator wants to see you.

225
00:11:54,966 --> 00:11:57,463
-他只是穿着那件夹克。-好的，太好了。
- He's just in the jacket there. - Okay, great.

226
00:11:57,463 --> 00:12:00,873
你能告诉她我来了吗有机会的话，来杯咖啡?
Will you just tell her I'm here and... you know, that coffee if you get a chance?

227
00:12:00,873 --> 00:12:02,138
哦。
Oh.

228
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,634
——丹·塔克。
- Dan Tucker.

229
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:06,406
好莱坞顶级特技协调员。
Big-time Hollywood stunt coordinator.

230
00:12:07,607 --> 00:12:08,947
是时候了。
It's about time.

231
00:12:08,947 --> 00:12:10,608
——恭喜你。
- Congratulations.

232
00:12:10,608 --> 00:12:12,247
谢谢你！看看你。
Thank you. Look at you.

233
00:12:12,247 --> 00:12:14,447
那我现在该叫你"先生"了，还是该怎么称呼你?
So do I call you "sir" now, or how does that work?

234
00:12:14,447 --> 00:12:16,383
你可以叫我"老板"
Oh, feel free to call me "boss," you know.

235
00:12:16,383 --> 00:12:17,923
-好的，老板。
- Okay, boss.

236
00:12:17,923 --> 00:12:19,749
我觉得我不该来这个诺墨克斯，对吧?
I don't think I should be in this Nomex, right?

237
00:12:19,749 --> 00:12:21,619
我是说，我们没有做什么疯狂的事，对吧?
I mean, it's like, we're not doing anything crazy, are we?

238
00:12:21,619 --> 00:12:23,060
我正要解释呢。
I was just about to explain that.

239
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,897
炮声?!
A cannon roll?!

240
00:12:24,897 --> 00:12:28,098
你是时候重新开始开车了，而不是把车停在那里。
It's time for you to start rolling cars again instead of parking them.

241
00:12:28,098 --> 00:12:30,166
你出车祸了。
You had an accident.

242
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,433
这是对钻机的严重误判。
It was a massive miscalculation of the rig.

243
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:35,237
我差点在全体船员面前自杀。
I-I almost killed myself in front of the whole crew.

244
00:12:35,237 --> 00:12:39,571
我可不想我的第一次特技表演又是一次惨败，尤其是在乔迪面前。
You know, I'd rather just not have my first stunt back be another epic failure, especially in front of Jody.

245
00:12:39,571 --> 00:12:41,078
我是说，你懂的。
I mean, you understand.

246
00:12:41,078 --> 00:12:43,674
“关键不在于你能打得多狠。”
"It's not about how hard of a hit you can give."

247
00:12:43,674 --> 00:12:49,581
——哦。-“关键是你能被击中多少次，然后继续前进。”头里。
- Oh. -"It's about how many times you can get hit and keep moving forward." -Come on.

248
00:12:49,581 --> 00:12:52,826
这太糟了。你不能这样对我引用洛奇的话。
That's messed up. You can't quote Rocky on me like that.

249
00:12:52,826 --> 00:12:55,620
所以这是一把带匕首的激光枪?
So it's a laser gun with a dagger?

250
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,358
是的，就像刺刀一样。-对。
Yes, like a bayonet. -Right.

251
00:12:57,358 --> 00:13:00,658
我们需要刺刀吗?激光不会实现…在战场上，是的。百分百。
Do we need the bayonet? Wouldn't the laser achieve... On the battlefield, yes. Hundred percent.

252
00:13:00,658 --> 00:13:02,528
它的形状很奇怪。
It just gives it a quite a strange shape.

253
00:13:02,528 --> 00:13:04,101
-哦，结尾的吉他部分?-是的。
- Oh, this guitar bit at the end? - Yeah.

254
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:07,269
是啊，你说你想要金属的，所以就是重金属的。
Yeah, well, you said you wanted metal, so it's, like, heavy metal.

255
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:09,106
好的,这件……你做过多少次这样的手术?
Okay, how-how... how many have you done like this?

256
00:13:09,106 --> 00:13:10,437
-呃，两个。——好的。好。
- Uh, two. - Okay. Good.

257
00:13:10,437 --> 00:13:12,505
——几百。——哦。好吧。是的,太棒了。
- Hundred. - Ooh. Okay. Yeah, fantastic.

258
00:13:12,505 --> 00:13:14,705
-谢谢，老板。——好的。它看起来像一把吉他。
- Thanks, boss. - Okay. It looks like a guitar.

259
00:13:14,705 --> 00:13:16,641
是的。-奈杰尔，烟火怎么样了?
Yes. -Nigel, how we doing on the pyrotechnics?

260
00:13:16,641 --> 00:13:18,280
这是怎么呢？-我想我们只够拍一次。
What's going on? -I think we only have enough for one take.

261
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,886
——老板!老板,听。——没有。来吧。-是的。
- Boss! Boss, listen. - No. Come on. -Yes.

262
00:13:19,886 --> 00:13:23,186
是吗?我们可以用视觉特效做一些看起来更真实的东西。-不不不
Yes? -We could create something that looks - way more realistic with VFX. - No, no, no.

263
00:13:23,186 --> 00:13:24,550
-别这样。把它给我。-超大杯，超大杯，超大杯
- Come on. Give it to me. - Venti, Venti, Venti.

264
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,123
我不想要真的。我不想要真的。
I don't want real. I don't want real.

265
00:13:26,123 --> 00:13:28,125
这是一部科幻史诗，宇宙爱情故事。-为什么?
This is a sci-fi epic, cosmic love story. -Why?

266
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,687
好吧?宇宙的比例。
Okay? Of cosmic proportions.

267
00:13:29,687 --> 00:13:33,229
它必须反映出你坠入爱河时那种超凡脱俗的感觉。
It's got to mirror that otherworldly thing when you fall in love.

268
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,692
你知道，这是不完美的。它是美丽的。
You know, it's-it's imperfect. It's beautiful.

269
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:36,199
我想要那样，好吗?
I want it that way, okay?

270
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:38,135
我们来一次大拍，好吗?-好的。
Let's go big with our one take, okay? -Okay.

271
00:13:38,135 --> 00:13:39,466
-我操。
- Holy shit.

272
00:13:39,466 --> 00:13:40,665
是这样吗?那是我拍的吗?
Was that it? Was that my one take?

273
00:13:40,665 --> 00:13:43,635
我肯定我们。-我的天啊!
Uh, I'm sure we have-- - Oh, my God!

274
00:13:43,635 --> 00:13:45,142
不过我得说，看起来太棒了。
Well, I got to say, though, looks absolutely fantastic.

275
00:13:45,142 --> 00:13:46,407
老板。听着,听着。-看啊。
-Boss. Listen, listen. - Look at that.

276
00:13:46,407 --> 00:13:48,079
你确定要用真正的烟火吗?
You sure you want to use real pyros?

277
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,377
是的。但我们绝对不需要这个。
Yeah. But we definitely don't need this.

278
00:13:49,377 --> 00:13:50,884
-不不不不是的。-我们没有。
- No, no, no, no. Yeah. - We don't.

279
00:13:50,884 --> 00:13:52,182
我们只需要让演员循环一下。
Well, we're just gonna have to loop the actors.

280
00:13:52,182 --> 00:13:53,678
-就这些。-没关系，雷。
- That's all. - That's okay, Ray.

281
00:13:53,678 --> 00:13:55,317
是个戴着头盔的特技演员在车里?
It's a stuntman in a car with a helmet on, okay?

282
00:13:55,317 --> 00:13:56,714
——哦。好吧。-没有循环。没有废话。
- Oh. Uh, all right. - No looping. No monologuing.

283
00:13:56,714 --> 00:13:57,649
那边到底怎么回事，拉什?
What the hell is going on over there, Rush?

284
00:13:57,649 --> 00:13:58,925
我们没有叫烟火。
We did not call for pyro.

285
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:01,521
我一定会找到你的家人把他们杀光!
I will seriously track down your family and kill every last one of them!

286
00:14:01,521 --> 00:14:03,193
这就是他们这么做的原因。
This is why they're doing it.

287
00:14:03,193 --> 00:14:04,997
因为他们觉得你不尊重他们，奈杰尔?
'Cause they feel you don't respect them, Nigel, okay?

288
00:14:04,997 --> 00:14:08,935
是我的语气。-你的语气，你的话，所有的一切，只是…-我明白了，好吧。乔迪?乔迪?-达拉，什么事?好吧。是的。
It's my tone. -Your tone, your words, all of it, just... - I see, okay. -Jody? Jody? - Darla, yes? Okay. Yeah.

289
00:14:08,935 --> 00:14:12,169
乔迪，抱歉，我…我的打印机昨晚坏了。-好吧。
Jody, um, sorry, I... I couldn't get my printer - working last night... - Okay, yep.

290
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:20,771
．..但我在某种程度上综合了我们在第三幕的对话，如果电影中的一个角色在电影中承认我们在第三幕遇到了问题怎么办?
...but I sort of synthesized our conversation that we had on the third act, and what if one of the characters in the film acknowledges in the film that we're having a problem with the third act?

291
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:22,542
——是吗?——没有。不。
- Yeah? - No. No.

292
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:23,873
但我很感激你能跳出思维定势，达拉。
But I appreciate you thinking outside the box, Darla.

293
00:14:23,873 --> 00:14:25,050
-我真的，真的。
- I really, really do.

294
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,843
奈杰尔，你得阻止他们。
Nigel, you've got to stop them.

295
00:14:26,843 --> 00:14:28,185
我会像宰猪一样宰了你们!-我的天啊。
I will gut you like the pigs that you are! -Oh, my God.

296
00:14:28,185 --> 00:14:29,681
-停止测试!——哇!
- Stop testing! - Whoo!

297
00:14:29,681 --> 00:14:31,056
老板!——请讲?
-Boss! - Yep?

298
00:14:31,056 --> 00:14:33,091
-测试很顺利。——太棒了。
- Test went well. - Fantastic.

299
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:35,885
好了，伙计们，冷静点。看着我。
Okay, so, guys, simmer down. Eyes on me.

300
00:14:35,885 --> 00:14:37,425
接下来会发生什么。
Here's what's gonna happen.

301
00:14:37,425 --> 00:14:39,229
没有视觉特效，超大号。看起来简直太棒了。
No VFX, Venti. It looks absolutely fabulous.

302
00:14:39,229 --> 00:14:41,099
奈杰尔，我们得开枪了。潮水来了。
Nigel, we need to shoot now. The tide's coming in.

303
00:14:41,099 --> 00:14:42,463
我们走吧。这将是一个史诗般的镜头。
Let's go. The shot's gonna be epic.

304
00:14:42,463 --> 00:14:44,795
还有五分钟就开始了。谢谢你！
Shot's up in five, people. Thank you.

305
00:14:55,984 --> 00:14:57,610
小马吗?兄弟吗?
-Colt? Brother?

306
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,480
怎么了，伙计?
What's happening, man?

307
00:15:00,945 --> 00:15:02,780
-糟糕的沙子。-糟糕的沙子。
- Bad sand. - Bad sand.

308
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,320
是的。
Yeah.

309
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,157
我想我们得推迟。真不想这么说。
I think we got to postpone. Hate to say it.

310
00:15:06,157 --> 00:15:08,126
奈杰尔丹，请问为什么延误?
NIGEL Dan, what's the delay, please?

311
00:15:08,126 --> 00:15:10,095
我们只是在做一点安全检查。
Uh, we're just doing a little safety check.

312
00:15:10,095 --> 00:15:11,393
它是密度。密度很低。
It's the density. It's bad density.

313
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:13,263
我们在看沙子的密度。
We're looking at the density of the sand.

314
00:15:13,263 --> 00:15:14,495
有个新司机。
There's a new driver.

315
00:15:14,495 --> 00:15:16,068
-是谁?亨利在哪儿?-不知道。
- Who is it? Where's Henry? - No idea.

316
00:15:16,068 --> 00:15:19,764
奈杰尔，这是整部电影最重要的镜头，我有个新人。
Nigel, this is the biggest shot of the film, and I have a newbie.

317
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,602
-丹说我们能做到——好的。
- Dan says we can do it. - Okay.

318
00:15:22,602 --> 00:15:25,407
说真的，我们要到处漂泊了。
Seriously, we're gonna drift all over the place.

319
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:27,079
那是什么，帝王潮吗?
What is that, a king tide?

320
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:28,806
这是你要做的。你等着它进来。
Here's what you do. You wait till it comes in.

321
00:15:28,806 --> 00:15:31,446
它把沙子压实，然后我们把日落拍成日出。
It compacts the sand, then we shoot sunset for sunup.

322
00:15:31,446 --> 00:15:32,612
你拖延。
You're stalling.

323
00:15:32,612 --> 00:15:34,350
——也许。-你在拖延时间。
- Maybe. - You're stalling.

324
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:39,751
有两件事是正确的。-兄弟，我这里有一帐篷的澳大利亚菜鸟。
Two things can be true. -Brother, I've got a tent full of rookie Australians out here.

325
00:15:39,751 --> 00:15:40,950
我要吐了。
I'm gonna be sick.

326
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,622
你能行的。你就是我的真命天子。
You got this. You're the one.

327
00:15:42,622 --> 00:15:43,623
-你为什么这么说?——好吗?
- Why you got to say that? - Okay?

328
00:15:43,623 --> 00:15:44,789
你为什么这么说?
Why you got to say that?

329
00:15:44,789 --> 00:15:46,263
你已经做过无数次了。
You've done this a million times.

330
00:15:46,263 --> 00:15:48,298
你也一样。你知道吗，你把事情搞砸了。
And so have you. You know, you just jinxed it.

331
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:51,037
你把事情搞砸了!
You just jinxed it!

332
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:52,500
丹，请把司机叫上车来。
Hey, Dan, I need the driver in the car now, please.

333
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,831
-好了，涨潮了。-好的。
- Okay, the tide's coming up. -Okay.

334
00:15:53,831 --> 00:15:55,008
非常感谢。感谢你。
Thank you so much. Appreciate you.

335
00:15:55,008 --> 00:15:56,042
-那是乔迪吗?-是的，我是乔迪。
- Is that Jody? - Yes, it's Jody.

336
00:15:57,967 --> 00:15:59,540
她说我什么了?
She say something about me?

337
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,807
别再看你的脸了。阻止它。阻止它。
Stop with-- your-your face. Stop it. Stop it.

338
00:16:02,807 --> 00:16:05,117
她什么都没说。
She didn't say anything about you.

339
00:16:05,117 --> 00:16:06,844
快上车!
Get in the car!

340
00:16:09,651 --> 00:16:11,321
这对她来说很重要。
This is really important to her.

341
00:16:11,321 --> 00:16:12,949
是的，这对她很重要。
Yes, it's important to her.

342
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:15,391
-这是动漫展还是什么?——H厅
- Is this Comic-Con or something? - Hall H.

343
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:21,430
“这是这样一个时刻，无论是一英寸还是一英里，赢就是赢。”
"This is one of those times, whether it's an inch or a mile, a win is a win."

344
00:16:23,764 --> 00:16:25,467
这很简单。《速度与激情》
That's easy. Fast and the Furious.

345
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:26,897
啊!
Ah!

346
00:16:26,897 --> 00:16:29,042
-走吧。你能行的。
- Let's go. You got this.

347
00:16:29,042 --> 00:16:30,373
你看到那个咖啡小姐了吗?
Did you see the coffee lady?

348
00:16:30,373 --> 00:16:31,572
她戴着一顶帽子。
She was wearing, like, a hat.

349
00:16:31,572 --> 00:16:33,079
-我看见你在车里。——好的。
- I see you in the car. - Okay.

350
00:16:34,247 --> 00:16:35,741
请把医护人员叫来。
Let's get the medics in place, please.

351
00:16:35,741 --> 00:16:37,809
这是英雄集。在那之后我还有五个。
This is the hero set. I've got five more after that.

352
00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:39,217
你准备好了吗，丹?是的。
Are you ready, Dan? Yeah.

353
00:16:39,217 --> 00:16:41,384
-摇滚。-把它锁起来!
-Rock and roll. -Lock it up!

354
00:16:41,384 --> 00:16:47,093
-谢谢。-三分钟后-奈杰尔好了，伙计们，他系好安全带了。特技已经准备好了。
-Thank you. -Three minute away-- NIGEL Okay, folks, he's buckled in. Stunts are ready.

355
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:48,655
男:祝你好运，柯尔特。
MAN Godspeed, Colt.

356
00:16:48,655 --> 00:16:50,426
每个人都知道自己的位置。
Everybody knows their spots.

357
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,428
每个人都知道自己的责任。
Everybody knows their responsibilities.

358
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,660
奈吉尔FX，请打开加农炮。
NIGEL FX, please go hot on the cannon.

359
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,167
把这件事做好。
Do this right.

360
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:56,597
男:好的，现在启动大炮。
MAN Okay, engaging the cannon now.

361
00:16:56,597 --> 00:16:58,071
我们保证安全，大家都能回家。
We do this safe and everybody goes home.

362
00:16:58,071 --> 00:16:59,666
MAN 2正在给大炮充电。
MAN 2 Charging the cannon.

363
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,207
伙计，加农炮有2000 PSI。
MAN 2,000 PSI in the cannon.

364
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,868
特技很好。
Stunts is good.

365
00:17:03,868 --> 00:17:05,903
MAN - 2加农炮很热。
MAN 2 Cannon is hot.

366
00:17:05,903 --> 00:17:07,509
摄像机，我们在哪里?
NIGEL Cameras, where are we at?

367
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:09,005
你在拍吗?相机吗?
Are you rolling? Camera one?

368
00:17:09,005 --> 00:17:10,413
-速度1。相机两个?
-Speed on one. -Camera two?

369
00:17:10,413 --> 00:17:11,876
- speed。相机三?
-Speed. -Camera three?

370
00:17:11,876 --> 00:17:13,251
-数到三速度。
-Speed on three.

371
00:17:17,717 --> 00:17:21,358
背景。三，二，一。
Background. And three, two, one.

372
00:17:21,358 --> 00:17:22,953
行动，行动，行动!
Action, action, action!

373
00:17:28,598 --> 00:17:30,026
好了，伙计们，保持冷静。
All right, guys, stay frosty.

374
00:17:30,026 --> 00:17:32,072
三，二，一!
Three, two, one!

375
00:17:38,971 --> 00:17:41,477
丹，我要他现在靠近摄像机。复制!
Dan, I need him close to the camera now. -Copy that!

376
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:45,778
听着，我不想成为那样的人，但是沙子有点松了。
Look, I don't want to be that guy, but the sand's a little loose.

377
00:17:45,778 --> 00:17:47,549
我没有任何牵引力。
I can't get any traction.

378
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:51,916
当我靠近的时候，它会跳起来，所以如果你再靠近，你就会失去摄像机。
When I do, it jumps, so if you get any closer, you're gonna lose the camera.

379
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,621
我知道，我知道，但进去吧。
I know, I know, but get in there.

380
00:17:53,621 --> 00:17:55,689
-你能行的，宝贝!-让开，让开。
- You got this, baby! - Move up, move up.

381
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:02,091
不，不，没那么近。哦。搞什么，奈杰尔继续拍。
No, no, not that close. Oh. What the-- NIGEL Keep rolling.

382
00:18:02,091 --> 00:18:03,631
我们还有七台摄像机。保持滚动!
We have seven more cameras. Keep rolling!

383
00:18:03,631 --> 00:18:05,633
好吧!
Okay!

384
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:08,537
准备，三，二，一!
Ready in three, two, one!

385
00:18:33,366 --> 00:18:36,334
奈杰尔:在特技部发出警报之前，谁也不能进去。
NIGEL Nobody goes in until stunts gives the all clear.

386
00:18:43,871 --> 00:18:45,310
-他还好吗?-科特，你没事吧?
- Is he all right? - Colt, you all right?

387
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,279
快，抓住他。快点，抓住他。
Quickly, get him. Come on, get him.

388
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:48,709
-快进去-我的天啊。
- Just get in there. -Oh, my God.

389
00:18:48,709 --> 00:18:51,613
-放松，放松。-柯尔特，你成功了!
- Easy, easy. -Colt, you did it!

390
00:18:51,613 --> 00:18:53,351
八卷半!
Eight and a half rolls!

391
00:18:53,351 --> 00:18:55,551
拜托，你还好吗?你好吗?
Come on, you okay? You good?

392
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,356
你好吗?嘿，嘿，嘿，嘿，嘿，嘿。
You good? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

393
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:02,360
杨晨的到来。等一等。好吧。
Jody's coming. Hold on. Okay.

394
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,790
太好了，丹。他好吗?
So good, Dan. Is he good?

395
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,121
-当然了。-太好了，太好了
- Yeah, of course. - So good, so good.

396
00:19:05,121 --> 00:19:06,958
很喜欢，很喜欢。
Loved it, loved it.

397
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,498
——不可思议的。——好的。
- Incredible. - Okay.

398
00:19:18,543 --> 00:19:19,676
这是谁的主意?
Whose idea was this?

399
00:19:21,172 --> 00:19:23,249
-我觉得是盖尔的主意。-我以为是你的主意。
- I think it was Gail's idea. - I thought it was your idea.

400
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:25,350
我昨天才知道这件事。
I-I just found out about this yesterday.

401
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,077
丹，别这样。
Dan, come on.

402
00:19:27,077 --> 00:19:29,684
我不赞成他。我不赞成他。
I didn't approve him. I didn't approve him.

403
00:19:29,684 --> 00:19:31,147
我绝对不会批准他的。
I would never have approved him.

404
00:19:31,147 --> 00:19:32,258
-她不认可我。
- She didn't approve me.

405
00:19:32,258 --> 00:19:33,358
我能跟你谈谈吗?
Can I talk to you for a second?

406
00:19:33,358 --> 00:19:34,524
我没有被批准。
I'm not approved.

407
00:19:34,524 --> 00:19:36,394
有趣的举动。真的。
Interesting move. Really.

408
00:19:36,394 --> 00:19:39,397
真的很有趣。只是很随意。
Really interesting. Just very casual.

409
00:19:39,397 --> 00:19:43,093
你来了，你出现了，然后说"我是你的新替身"
Here you are, you show up, and, "I'm your new stuntman."

410
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:58,284
不要那样做。你不能这么做。-什么?
Don't do that. You can't do that. -What?

411
00:19:58,284 --> 00:19:59,978
-导演一部电影。-你的帽子要掉了。
- Directing a movie. - Your hat's coming off.

412
00:20:01,718 --> 00:20:03,355
你为什么在这里?
Why are you here?

413
00:20:03,355 --> 00:20:05,588
我想这是个误会。很明显。
I think there's been a misunderstanding. -Clearly.

414
00:20:05,588 --> 00:20:11,429
因为我的印象是... ...是你想让我来的。
Because I was under the impression that... ...you did want me here.

415
00:20:11,429 --> 00:20:13,189
这是一种妄想。我们有一年没说过话了。
That's a delusional thought. We haven't spoken in a year.

416
00:20:13,189 --> 00:20:16,368
-我们别谈这个了。-盖尔盖尔但盖尔告诉我你想让我来——好的。无论什么。
- Let's not get into it. - Gail, Gail-- But Gail told me - that you wanted me here. - Okay. Whatever.

417
00:20:16,368 --> 00:20:17,864
我根本不在乎，但你把摄像机剪断了。
I don't even care about it, but you clipped the camera.

418
00:20:17,864 --> 00:20:20,229
我有点生疏了。
I-I-I'm a little rusty.

419
00:20:20,229 --> 00:20:21,967
-动漫展的镜头毁了。-对不起，我知道
- Comic-Con shot ruined. - I'm sor-- I know.

420
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:24,134
- h厅，这可是件大事。-是的。是的。
- Hall H. It's a big deal. - Yeah. Yeah.

421
00:20:24,134 --> 00:20:26,136
——恭喜你。-谢谢。
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

422
00:20:26,136 --> 00:20:28,138
我为你感到高兴。
I'm happy for you.

423
00:20:31,176 --> 00:20:33,583
你扮导演很合适啊。
This whole director thing looks good on you.

424
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,080
甚至连园艺帽也不知道怎么回事。
Even the gardening hat, somehow.

425
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,655
每个人都戴。这就像一个固定的东西。
Everyone wears them. It's like a set thing.

426
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:43,890
——好吗?-是的，我看到了。只是，他们没有你做得那么好，仅此而已。
- Okay? - Yeah, I see it. It's-- They're not making it look as good as you are, that's all.

427
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,596
我并不是想要夸大其词，我只是在说事实。
And I'm not trying to be fla-- I'm just saying the facts.

428
00:20:46,596 --> 00:20:48,400
但是你穿什么都好看。
But you look good in everything.

429
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,831
你穿什么都不好看。无论什么。
You look good in nothing. Whatever.

430
00:20:50,831 --> 00:20:55,341
-不，我不是那个意思。——真的吗?这不是……但你穿什么都好看。-这没用的-这没用的-我是说，你有。
- No, I don't mean it like that. - Really? This isn't... But you do look good in nothing. -This isn't work-- - This isn't gonna work. - I mean, you do.

431
00:20:55,341 --> 00:20:57,310
但这不是我…
But it's not what I...

432
00:20:59,677 --> 00:21:01,347
-谁都可以。其他任何人。-是的。
- I'll take anyone. Anyone else. - Yeah.

433
00:21:01,347 --> 00:21:03,107
-除了他谁都可以。-我能跟你说实话吗?
- Anyone but him. -Can I be honest with you?

434
00:21:03,107 --> 00:21:05,384
-你找到谁了?是的。-我们真的没有别人了。
- Who have you got? Yep. - We literally have no one else.

435
00:21:06,948 --> 00:21:09,355
-下一步是什么?-火在燃烧。
- What's next? -The fire burn.

436
00:21:11,183 --> 00:21:12,919
你说了算。
It's your call.

437
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:14,690
好吧。-请找个护士待命好吗?
Okay. - Can we get a nurse on standby, please?

438
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,461
我们要把他点着。
We're gonna set this man on fire.

439
00:21:34,512 --> 00:21:36,206
切，切，切。-这是一个切口。
Cut, cut, cut. -That's a cut.

440
00:21:36,206 --> 00:21:38,483
-请停一下。-这是一个切口!
-Cutting there, please. -That's a cut!

441
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:43,356
你感觉怎么样，柯尔特·西弗斯?
How you feeling, Colt Seavers?

442
00:21:43,356 --> 00:21:44,687
他很好。-他很好。
-He's good. -He's all good.

443
00:21:44,687 --> 00:21:46,854
我们再来一次。竖起大拇指,好吗?
We're gonna go again. Thumbs-up, okay?

444
00:21:46,854 --> 00:21:48,317
技术问题。小车上有个小肿块。
Technical issue. Little bump on the dolly.

445
00:21:48,317 --> 00:21:50,726
——嗯?-你能修好吗，吉米?
- Huh? - Can you fix that, Jimmy?

446
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,321
-请回到一号位。-谢谢。
- Back to ones, please. - Thank you.

447
00:21:52,321 --> 00:21:54,191
最次。-拜托，回到一。
-Going again. -Please, back to one.

448
00:21:54,191 --> 00:21:56,127
柯尔特，你是不是觉得有点被逼到绝境了?
Colt, do you feel a bit flung into the deep end here?

449
00:21:56,127 --> 00:21:59,636
我只是在想，因为你还没读剧本，你想不想知道一些背景故事，一些背景?
I'm just wondering, 'cause you haven't read the script, if you'd like some backstory, some context?

450
00:21:59,636 --> 00:22:01,572
-这样可以吗?-随它去吧
- Would that be good? - Just go with it.

451
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:03,233
是的,有用吗?好吧。开始吧。
Yeah, helpful? Okay. Here we go.

452
00:22:03,233 --> 00:22:10,042
这是一个科幻爱情故事，两个角色，其中一个是外星人——阿莲娜——而你是太空牛仔。
So, sci-fi love story, two characters, one of them's an alien-- Aliena-- and you're Space Cowboy.

453
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:11,978
他们分享了所谓的月亮季节。
They shared what's called a moon season.

454
00:22:11,978 --> 00:22:14,310
在现实生活中，你可以称之为一时冲动。
In real life, you might call it a fling.

455
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:17,148
简短但很激烈。
Um, brief but very intense.

456
00:22:17,148 --> 00:22:19,689
和…充满希望。
And... hopeful.

457
00:22:20,956 --> 00:22:25,398
他们俩以前都没谈过这么深的恋爱。
Now, neither of them had ever been in a relationship that deep before.

458
00:22:25,398 --> 00:22:28,258
他们一遍又一遍地告诉彼此。
And they told each other that over and over and over again.

459
00:22:28,258 --> 00:22:32,064
他比她更重要，你知道，有时候她会说，冷静点。
Him more than her, you know, to the point where sometimes she was like, "Chill out," you know.

460
00:22:32,064 --> 00:22:39,907
但无论如何，在悲剧的转折中，太空牛仔受伤了，他就这样消失了。
But anyway, in a tragic turn of events, Space Cowboy is wounded, and he just disappears.

461
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,580
没有一丝痕迹。
Without a trace.

462
00:22:48,115 --> 00:22:49,455
我可以继续。
I can keep going.

463
00:22:49,455 --> 00:22:51,787
我现在能更好地击中岩石了，谢谢。
I can hit the rock better now, thanks.

464
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:52,953
我们又要去了!
We're going again!

465
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,595
声音的速度。
Sound speed.

466
00:22:57,595 --> 00:22:59,388
和行动!
And action!

467
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,898
-这是一个切口!
-That's a cut!

468
00:23:03,898 --> 00:23:05,537
请从这里切入。
Cutting there, please.

469
00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:09,640
资料,好吗?你好吗?
-Everything okay? -You good?

470
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,644
再多说点背景，柯尔特，阿莲娜有点崩溃了。
For a little more context, Colt, Aliena's sort of devastated.

471
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:17,109
她开始在脑海里一遍又一遍地回放所有的事情。
And she starts sort of replaying everything in her head over and over again.

472
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:19,210
她是不是看错了气氛?
Did she misread the vibe?

473
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,651
只是一时冲动吗?
Was it just a fling?

474
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:23,588
她又让自己的想象力肆意驰骋了吗?
Did she let her imagination run wild again?

475
00:23:23,588 --> 00:23:25,557
还是他骗了她?
Or did he lie to her?

476
00:23:25,557 --> 00:23:27,625
他满口胡言吗?
Was he full of shit?

477
00:23:29,596 --> 00:23:30,958
但我要说清楚:
But let me be clear:

478
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:32,993
最终，阿莲娜离开了。
eventually, Aliena did move on.

479
00:23:32,993 --> 00:23:34,929
好吧?
All right?

480
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:37,228
她开始做普拉提。
And she started doing Pilates.

481
00:23:37,228 --> 00:23:43,003
给自己弄了个复仇的好身材，然后开始和其他人约会。
Got herself a banging revenge body, and then she started dating other humans.

482
00:23:43,003 --> 00:23:45,104
一个接一个。
One after another.

483
00:23:45,104 --> 00:23:50,439
她有那么多令人兴奋的、远超常人的经历，你甚至不会相信。
And she had so many mind-blowing, far superior experiences, you wouldn't even believe it.

484
00:23:50,439 --> 00:23:51,781
-对吧，姑娘们?-是的。
- Right, girls? - Yeah.

485
00:23:51,781 --> 00:23:53,442
-你懂我的意思吗?-是的。是的。
- You know what I mean? - Yeah. Yeah.

486
00:23:53,442 --> 00:23:54,751
是啊，就像寿司火车一样。
Yeah, it was like a sushi train.

487
00:23:54,751 --> 00:23:57,413
我要吐了。
I'm gonna be sick.

488
00:23:57,413 --> 00:24:00,988
你知道吗?我们再来一遍，柯尔特，因为刚才那个有点嗡嗡声。
And do you know what? We're gonna go again, Colt, 'cause there was a little buzz on that one.

489
00:24:00,988 --> 00:24:02,462
好吧，把他点着。
Okay, light him up.

490
00:24:03,487 --> 00:24:05,597
最后一个，各位。行动!
Last one, everybody. Action!

491
00:24:08,831 --> 00:24:13,198
只是感觉太压抑了，我们谈谈怎么样?
It-It's just feeling so withheld, so how 'bout some dialogue?

492
00:24:13,198 --> 00:24:14,606
没事的，达拉。
Yeah, that's all right, Darla.

493
00:24:14,606 --> 00:24:16,300
我要直接去找源头。
I'm gonna go straight to the source.

494
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:22,779
嘿，柯尔特，如果太空牛仔必须说点什么，如果他被迫说点什么，他会说什么?
Hey, Colt, if Space Cowboy had to say something, if he was forced to say something, what would he say?

495
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:26,013
他怎么能证明她这一年都在纠结这件事?
How would he justify this year she's spent spinning out over this?

496
00:24:26,013 --> 00:24:27,850
他能说什么呢?这是个谜题，不是吗?
What could he say? It's a puzzler, isn't it?

497
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:31,557
-你有什么想法吗?-也许他可以谈谈…奈杰尔，你能给他拿个扩音器吗?
- But have you got any thoughts? - Uh, maybe he could talk... Nigel, can you, can you get him a bullhorn?

498
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:33,449
我听不见他说话。
I can't hear him.

499
00:24:33,449 --> 00:24:34,659
旅行。
Traveling.

500
00:24:43,734 --> 00:24:45,329
再来，小马。那是什么?
Come again, Colt. What was that?

501
00:24:45,329 --> 00:24:52,743
-已经开了。-在这部电影里，外星人和人类有说过话吗?在私人吗?
- It's already on. - In this movie, do the aliens and the humans ever talk... in private?

502
00:24:53,845 --> 00:24:55,746
-不，不完全是。-没有私人谈话?
- No, not really. - No private conversations?

503
00:24:55,746 --> 00:24:57,308
不，他们不喜欢做私人的。
No, they don't like doing private.

504
00:24:57,308 --> 00:24:58,650
比如，他们喜欢保持公开。
Like, they like to keep it very public.

505
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,344
-非常开放。——哦。
- Very open. - Oh.

506
00:25:02,348 --> 00:25:06,757
好吧，也许我应该，对大家开放。
Well, maybe I'll just, uh, open it up to the group here.

507
00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:15,392
你有没有遇到过这种情况... ...你想说点什么，而且事情很重要，不能搞砸吗?
Have you ever been in one of those situations where... ... you want to say something and it's so important that you can't mess it up?

508
00:25:15,392 --> 00:25:24,676
所以，你想了很久，然后你意识到……你已经搞砸了?
So, you think long and hard about it, and then you realize... you've already messed it up?

509
00:25:24,676 --> 00:25:29,373
因为你想得太久太辛苦了?
'Cause you've thought too long and too hard about it?

510
00:25:30,783 --> 00:25:33,949
你……那是什么?
You're... What's that?

511
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:37,216
-你想…
- You want...

512
00:25:41,627 --> 00:25:45,455
当我爱上我妻子的妹妹时，我也有过类似的情况。
I had a similar situation when I fell in love with my wife's sister.

513
00:25:45,455 --> 00:25:46,929
——好的。好吧。什么……——没有。
- Okay. All right. What... - No.

514
00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:49,261
——没有。好吧。
- No. Okay.

515
00:25:49,261 --> 00:25:55,641
嗯…再说一次，这很难，因为……你知道，我还没读剧本。
Uh... And again, this is hard because... you know, I haven't read the script.

516
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:57,137
但是…
But...

517
00:25:59,205 --> 00:26:04,980
．..他可能会说... ...他一直活在…
...he'd probably say... ...t hat he's been living...

518
00:26:07,281 --> 00:26:09,655
．..从那时起就一直后悔。
...in total regret since then.

519
00:26:11,087 --> 00:26:19,555
你知道，害怕……他永远不会有机会补偿她... ...因为他等得太久了。
You know, afraid... that he'll never get an opportunity to make it up to her... ...because he waited too long.

520
00:26:19,555 --> 00:26:21,161
和…
And...

521
00:26:23,935 --> 00:26:25,803
．..她可能已经向前看了。
...she's probably moved on.

522
00:26:25,803 --> 00:26:33,811
抱歉，乔迪，说到向前看，我们…多一个吗?
Uh, sorry, Jody, speaking of moving on, we, uh... One more?

523
00:26:38,609 --> 00:26:40,653
我希望再给我一次机会。
I'd love another chance.

524
00:26:44,219 --> 00:26:46,186
-滚吧，奈杰尔。-我们翻过去吧!
- Roll it, Nigel. - Let's turn over, please!

525
00:26:46,186 --> 00:26:48,023
-所有摄像机都在拍摄。-枪响了，声音在加速。
- All cameras are rolling. - Shot's up, sound speeding.

526
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,222
好吧，把他点着!
Okay, light him up!

527
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:53,292
行动!谢谢你！
Action! Thank you!

528
00:27:00,741 --> 00:27:02,301
盖尔?
Gail?

529
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:05,942
盖尔?
Gail?

530
00:27:05,942 --> 00:27:08,109
哦。咖啡。
Oh. Coffee.

531
00:27:16,581 --> 00:27:18,515
毫米!你在这里。
Mm! You're here.

532
00:27:18,515 --> 00:27:19,857
哦，不，别用那个。它坏了。
Oh, no, don't use that. It's broken.

533
00:27:19,857 --> 00:27:22,453
八卷半?
Eight and a half rolls?

534
00:27:22,453 --> 00:27:25,456
这是一项世界纪录!
That is a world record!

535
00:27:25,456 --> 00:27:28,393
非常感谢。
Thank you so much.

536
00:27:28,393 --> 00:27:31,066
这比停车好多了，不是吗?
It's better than parking cars, isn't it?

537
00:27:32,628 --> 00:27:34,564
-你能别说了吗，盖尔?
- Would you cut the shit, Gail?

538
00:27:34,564 --> 00:27:36,709
怎么啦？太神奇了。你在说什么?
What? It was amazing. What are you talking about?

539
00:27:36,709 --> 00:27:39,008
她不想让我在这里，盖尔。
She doesn't want me here, Gail.

540
00:27:39,008 --> 00:27:40,372
是的，她喜欢。
Yes, she does.

541
00:27:40,372 --> 00:27:41,978
哦，她当然知道。
Oh, of course she does.

542
00:27:41,978 --> 00:27:44,816
-你撒谎了。你说谎了。——哦。
- You lied. You lied. - Oh.

543
00:27:44,816 --> 00:27:46,752
——小马。-你知道那是什么感觉吗?
- Colt. - Do you know how that feels?

544
00:27:46,752 --> 00:27:48,721
我觉得你应该得到第二次机会。
I think you deserve a second chance.

545
00:27:48,721 --> 00:27:52,549
这是我所有电影的主题。
It's, like, the message in all my movies.

546
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:54,188
我所有的电影都在传递什么信息?
What's the message in all my movies?

547
00:27:54,188 --> 00:27:58,797
嗯…虚无主义是可行的世界观?
Uh... Nihilism's a viable worldview?

548
00:28:00,427 --> 00:28:03,065
不，那只是娱乐。
No, that's just the entertainment.

549
00:28:03,065 --> 00:28:06,937
这就像…比如性感培根。
That's like the... like the sexy bacon.

550
00:28:06,937 --> 00:28:08,840
-这是什么?-你知道吗?就像狗一样。
- What is this? - You know? It's like dogs.

551
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:13,636
你得把信息包起来……在性感的培根里。
You got to wrap the message... in some sexy bacon.

552
00:28:14,881 --> 00:28:17,343
我是说，所有那些电影里，人都会摔倒。
I mean, all those movies, people fall down.

553
00:28:17,343 --> 00:28:19,279
他们在自己的屎堆里打滚。
They're rolling in their own shit.

554
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,512
他们不认为自己能应付，但他们能。他们站起来。
They don't think they can cope, but they can. They get back up.

555
00:28:21,512 --> 00:28:23,349
你介意我躺下吗?
Do you mind if I lay down?

556
00:28:23,349 --> 00:28:28,794
多处火焰燃烧，大炮轰鸣，还有时差，我只是…-对，对，对。
With the multiple fire burns and the cannon rolls - and the jet lag, I just... - Yep, yep, yep.

557
00:28:28,794 --> 00:28:30,290
．..我该睡一会儿了。
...could use a little shut-eye.

558
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,423
是的。
Yep.

559
00:28:31,423 --> 00:28:33,062
好吧，让我搞清楚。
Okay, let me get this straight.

560
00:28:34,263 --> 00:28:37,231
-虚无主义是性感的培根?-是的。
- Nihilism is the sexy bacon? - Yeah.

561
00:28:37,231 --> 00:28:39,035
观众是狗?
The audience are dogs?

562
00:28:39,035 --> 00:28:40,432
好了。
There we go.

563
00:28:40,432 --> 00:28:43,600
当你跌倒时，你会重新站起来。
And when you fall down, you get back up.

564
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,470
-谢谢。-我很高兴我们这么做了。
- Thank you. - I'm glad we did this.

565
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:48,605
我到底在这里做什么，盖尔?
Now, what am I really doing here, Gail?

566
00:28:50,642 --> 00:28:53,577
嗯…赖德的失踪。
Um... Ryder's missing.

567
00:28:53,577 --> 00:28:58,318
他结交了一些见不得光的，卑鄙的，卑鄙的人。
He has fallen in with some shady, shitty, shitty people.

568
00:28:58,318 --> 00:29:03,125
盖尔... ...报警。
Well, Gail... ...call the cops.

569
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:04,489
我不能叫警察。
I can't call the cops.

570
00:29:04,489 --> 00:29:06,062
为什么不呢?
Well, why not?

571
00:29:06,062 --> 00:29:08,757
工作室会知道我远远超出预算。
The studio will know that I am way over budget.

572
00:29:08,757 --> 00:29:10,429
他们会终止这个项目的。
They will pull the plug on this.

573
00:29:10,429 --> 00:29:12,937
你知道的。
You know that.

574
00:29:12,937 --> 00:29:14,235
请去找他。
Please go and find him.

575
00:29:14,235 --> 00:29:15,566
为什么是我?
Why me?

576
00:29:15,566 --> 00:29:17,601
看在上帝的份上，你是个特技演员。
You're a stuntman, for God's sake.

577
00:29:17,601 --> 00:29:19,768
没人会注意到你在不在的。
No one's gonna notice whether you're here or not.

578
00:29:19,768 --> 00:29:21,638
-无意冒犯。-我是说，有些人。
- No offense. - I mean, some taken.

579
00:29:21,638 --> 00:29:24,410
你和他很熟。
You know him intimately.

580
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,115
它可以如此简单。
It can be so simple.

581
00:29:26,115 --> 00:29:30,251
你把他捡起来，掸掸身上的灰尘，把他带回来。
You pick him up, you dust him off, you bring him back here.

582
00:29:30,251 --> 00:29:31,857
我知道我可以信任你。
I know I can trust you.

583
00:29:31,857 --> 00:29:36,422
你知道谁比任何人都更信任你吗，她只是还没意识到，就是乔迪。
And you know who can trust you more than anyone, she just doesn't realize it yet, is Jody.

584
00:29:36,422 --> 00:29:39,359
这是她的大好机会。
This is her big chance.

585
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:42,164
你想让她的第一部电影成为最后一部吗?
Do you want her first movie to be her last?

586
00:29:42,164 --> 00:29:44,496
你得帮帮我，伙计。
You've got to help me out, man.

587
00:29:45,906 --> 00:29:48,500
这几天真难熬。
It's been a long couple days.

588
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:55,639
我要去酒店，我要怎么了?这是我的昨天，这是你的明天——我将称你为你的明天。
I'm gonna go to the hotel, I'm gonna-- What is it? It's my yesterday, it's your tomor-- I'm gonna call you your tomorrow.

589
00:29:55,639 --> 00:29:57,377
-好吧，不。今天。-我的今天。
- Right, no. Today. - My today.

590
00:29:57,377 --> 00:29:59,016
这是莱德公寓的门码。
That is the door code of Ryder's loft.

591
00:29:59,016 --> 00:30:00,952
院子的门。从他的拖车里拿的。
The patio door. Took it from his trailer.

592
00:30:00,952 --> 00:30:02,954
他还在做便利贴吗?
He's still doing this Post-it note thing?

593
00:30:02,954 --> 00:30:05,022
哦。我们就不谈这个了。
Oh. Let's not even get into that.

594
00:30:05,022 --> 00:30:07,783
在这一点上，它就像记忆碎片级别。
At this point, it's like Memento level.

595
00:30:07,783 --> 00:30:12,557
我最多只能瞒着乔迪和演播室48小时。
I can only keep this from Jody and the studio 48 hours max.

596
00:30:12,557 --> 00:30:16,660
拯救乔迪的电影，也许你就能找回你的挚爱。
Save Jody's movie, and maybe you get the love of your life back.

597
00:30:18,268 --> 00:30:20,829
你刚把乔迪变成性感培根了吗?
Did you just turn Jody into the sexy bacon?

598
00:30:20,829 --> 00:30:23,975
她一直都是性感的培根。
She's been the sexy bacon all along.

599
00:30:23,975 --> 00:30:25,372
你很好。
You're good.

600
00:30:25,372 --> 00:30:27,605
这是我唯一的左手驱动器。
It's the only left-hand drive I have.

601
00:30:29,378 --> 00:30:31,543
请不要破坏它。这是植入式广告。
Please don't wreck it. It's product placement.

602
00:30:31,543 --> 00:30:34,051
只有两个。
There's only two of them.

603
00:30:34,051 --> 00:30:36,284
我知道你们这些蠢货怎么开车。
I know how you stunties drive.

604
00:30:39,388 --> 00:30:42,092
你想毁掉我所珍视的一切。
You seek to destroy all I hold dear.

你在干什么?
What are you doing?

622
00:32:15,746 --> 00:32:17,649
只是，放松一下。
Uh, just, uh, chilling down.

623
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:19,519
你是在对泰勒·斯威夫特“放松”吗?
Were you "chilling down" to Taylor Swift?

624
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,488
——是的。毫米。
- Yep. - Mm.

625
00:32:21,488 --> 00:32:23,325
这只是澳大利亚人说的话。
It's just something Australians say.

626
00:32:23,325 --> 00:32:24,755
真的吗?我来这儿六个月了，从来没听说过。
Really? I've been here for six months, I've never heard it.

627
00:32:24,755 --> 00:32:27,527
是啊，"放松一下"不过"放松一下"更短些
Yeah, "chilling down under," you know, but it's shorter to say "chilling down."

628
00:32:27,527 --> 00:32:29,694
-你哭了吗?-一点也不。
- Have you been crying? - Not at all.

629
00:32:29,694 --> 00:32:31,234
你看起来好像哭过。
You look like you've been crying.

630
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:34,699
时差。
Jet lag.

631
00:32:34,699 --> 00:32:37,636
那太危险了，我很抱歉。
That was so dangerous, and I'm very sorry.

632
00:32:37,636 --> 00:32:39,704
像那样照亮你。
Lighting you up like that.

633
00:32:39,704 --> 00:32:42,113
这是一种宣泄。
It was very cathartic.

634
00:32:42,113 --> 00:32:44,247
-我感觉好多了。-我活该。
- I feel better. - I deserved it.

635
00:32:46,647 --> 00:32:49,813
顺便说一句，我要把摄像机补偿给你。
I'm gonna make the camera up to you, by the way.

636
00:32:49,813 --> 00:32:52,057
我能和你一起上车吗?
Can I get in the car with you?

637
00:32:54,259 --> 00:32:56,490
洗脸。你真是一团糟。
Clean your face. You're a mess.

638
00:32:59,825 --> 00:33:01,231
你过得怎么样?
So how have you been?

639
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:03,662
哦，你知道的。
Oh, you know.

640
00:33:05,336 --> 00:33:06,830
是吗?竖起大拇指?
Yeah? Thumbs-up?

641
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:09,701
天啊，我讨厌那些废话，那些特技演员的废话。
God, I hate that bullshit, that stunt guy bullshit.

642
00:33:11,111 --> 00:33:12,308
-没关系。
- And that's fine.

643
00:33:12,308 --> 00:33:13,672
你不需要解释任何事。
You don't have to explain anything.

644
00:33:13,672 --> 00:33:15,476
一切都很好。那是一时冲动。
It's all good. It was a fling.

645
00:33:15,476 --> 00:33:17,577
不只是一时冲动。只是个小插曲，没关系。
Less than a fling. It was a flingette, and that's fine.

646
00:33:17,577 --> 00:33:19,381
我根本不想知道。
I don't even want to know.

647
00:33:19,381 --> 00:33:21,845
强迫别人做事的问题是你什么都得不到。
And the problem with forcing something is you get nowhere.

648
00:33:21,845 --> 00:33:23,682
你知道吗，有一次我妈妈强迫我爸爸锻炼。
You know, one time my mom forced my dad to exercise.

649
00:33:23,682 --> 00:33:25,486
你知道发生了什么吗?
Do you know what happened?

650
00:33:25,486 --> 00:33:27,389
他第一次踏上跑步机就扭伤了脚踝。
Snapped his ankle first time he stepped on the treadmill.

651
00:33:27,389 --> 00:33:29,985
她强迫的，现在他脚上有一块金属。
She forced it, now he has a piece of metal in his foot.

652
00:33:29,985 --> 00:33:32,196
这个故事的寓意是，你应该做你自己。
Moral of the story is you should just be you.

653
00:33:34,959 --> 00:33:41,700
听着，其实我想了很多，我…我又不是不想道歉无数次。
Well, look, I've thought a lot about this, actually, and I, uh... It's not like I didn't want to apologize a million times.

654
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,866
是的。
Yeah.

655
00:33:42,866 --> 00:33:45,407
只是，每次我…
Uh, it's just, every time I...

656
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,710
你知道，当我想到要说什么的时候…
You know, when I think of something to say...

657
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,616
．..似乎还不够。
...doesn't seem like enough.

658
00:34:01,887 --> 00:34:03,524
好吧。
Okay.

659
00:34:03,524 --> 00:34:05,361
没有问题。
No problem.

660
00:34:05,361 --> 00:34:08,298
边界。边界。
Boundaries. Boundaries.

661
00:34:08,298 --> 00:34:09,629
这很重要。
That's important.

662
00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:11,433
因为我有很大的压力。
Because I have a lot of pressure on me.

663
00:34:11,433 --> 00:34:15,305
你不知道拍这部电影对我来说有多难?
You have no idea how hard it was for me to make this movie, okay?

664
00:34:15,305 --> 00:34:21,179
我只需要集中精神，所以如果你要留在这里，我们就得…超级专业。
I just need to focus, so if you're gonna stay here, we need to keep it... like, super profesh.

665
00:34:22,248 --> 00:34:23,577
“专业”是我的中间名。
"Professional" is my middle name.

666
00:34:23,577 --> 00:34:25,513
嗯哼。
Mm-hmm.

667
00:34:27,484 --> 00:34:29,044
我以为你的中间名是"危险"
I thought your middle name was "Danger."

668
00:34:29,044 --> 00:34:31,750
那是艺名。
That's a stage name.

669

柯尔特·西弗斯教授。

670

Promise me you're not gonna derail this, okay?

671
00:34:43,091 --> 00:34:44,598
的承诺。
Promise.

672
00:34:46,305 --> 00:34:49,339
好吧。
Okay.

673
00:34:53,774 --> 00:34:55,708
想要吃甜甜圈吗?
Want to do some doughnuts?

674

你想开车送我去取车吗?
Do you want to drive me to my car?

675
00:35:07,258 --> 00:35:08,820
-是的。
- Yeah.

676
00:35:19,734 --> 00:35:21,305

730
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,637
我是伊基·斯塔尔，金属风暴乐队的女主角。
I'm Iggy Starr, lead actress on Metalstorm.

731
00:38:43,837 --> 00:38:45,234
-我是莱德的女朋友。——哦。
- I'm Ryder's girlfriend. - Oh.

732
00:38:45,234 --> 00:38:46,741
-你在金属风暴。-是的。
- You're in Metalstorm. - Yeah.

733
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:52,384
你是不是演过那部电影《劫车记》一个叫杰克的家伙偷了你的车然后你朝他的手开枪说"我希望你知道怎么开手动挡"
Hey, were you in that movie Carjacked where that guy named Jack steals your car and then you shoot him in the hand and you say, "I hope you know how to drive stick"?

734
00:38:52,384 --> 00:38:57,356
这说不通，因为这应该是“自动的”，但你说话的方式…那是娜奥米·沃茨!
And it doesn't make sense 'cause it's like, should be "automatic," but the way you say it... That's Naomi Watts!

735
00:39:03,021 --> 00:39:04,220
我只是个特技演员。
I'm just a stunt guy.

736
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,222
我也在做《金属风暴》。
I'm working on Metalstorm, too.

737
00:39:06,222 --> 00:39:09,225
你撒谎!我们只在金属风暴1号。
You lie! We're only on Metalstorm 1.

738
00:39:09,225 --> 00:39:11,062
-我的意思是也!
- I meant also!

这是道具剑吗?
Is this a prop sword?

嗯哼。我是个好演员。
Mm-hmm. I'm a good actress.

741
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:38,122
如果你真的在制作金属风暴，为什么还偷偷摸摸来这里?
Hey, if you are really working on Metalstorm, why are you sneaking around here?

742
00:39:38,122 --> 00:39:40,058
我只是想找莱德。
Just trying to find Ryder.

743
00:39:40,058 --> 00:39:42,533
他现在嗑药了，有点偏执。
He's, like, really drugged up and paranoid right now.

744
00:39:42,533 --> 00:39:44,359
他觉得有人想杀他。
He thinks someone's trying to kill him.

745
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:49,771
我说"如果你不完成金属风暴，我就亲手杀了你"
And I'm like, "If you don't finish Metalstorm, I'm gonna kill you myself."

746
00:39:49,771 --> 00:39:51,971
现在，有些黑暗的事情正在发生。
Now, there is some dark shit going on.

747
00:39:51,971 --> 00:39:54,303
我越早离开这里越好。
And the sooner I can get out of here, the better.

748
00:39:55,845 --> 00:39:57,779
哇。
Wow.

749
00:39:57,779 --> 00:39:59,649
知道在哪能找到他吗?
Any idea where I could find him?

750
00:39:59,649 --> 00:40:02,487
你可以去他常去的俱乐部试试。
Uh, you could try this club he hangs out at.

751
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:05,281
但你不可能穿得像个乞丐一样进去。
But you're never gonna get in looking like a povo.

752
00:40:05,281 --> 00:40:07,954
-什么是povo?-像你这样的穷人。
- What's a povo? - A poor person like you.

753
00:40:07,954 --> 00:40:09,989
哦。酷。
Oh. Cool.

754
00:40:09,989 --> 00:40:13,157
你的迈阿密风云特技队外套是怎么回事?
What's with your Miami Vice Stunt Team jacket?

755
00:40:13,157 --> 00:40:14,796
那是我的第一个节目。
Oh, it was the first show I ever did.

756
00:40:14,796 --> 00:40:18,228
我不得不让船从火圈里跳过去。
I had to jump a boat through a ring of fire.

757
00:40:18,228 --> 00:40:20,934
我做得很好，手被绑在背后都能做到。
I got so good I could do it with my hands tied behind my back.

758
00:40:22,432 --> 00:40:23,607
哇。
Wow.

759
00:40:23,607 --> 00:40:25,433
你真的很喜欢你自己。
You're really into yourself.

760
00:40:27,105 --> 00:40:29,074
我是说，你确实问过了。
I mean, you know, you did ask.

761
00:40:29,074 --> 00:40:30,746
夜总会的霓虹灯之夜。
It's neon night at the club.

762
00:40:30,746 --> 00:40:33,749
他总是和一个叫杜恩的人在一起他的毒贩。
He's always there with this guy called Doone who's his drug dealer.

763
00:40:33,749 --> 00:40:35,344
他头上有豹纹纹身。
He's got, like, leopard print tats on his head.

764
00:40:35,344 --> 00:40:39,788
他们不会让像你这样的无名小卒进俱乐部的，所以你就像汤姆一样。你是他的特技替身。
They won't let a nobody like you into the club, so just act like Tom. You're his stunt double.

765
00:40:39,788 --> 00:40:41,416
你知道怎么做，对吧?
You know how to do that, don't you?

766
00:40:41,416 --> 00:40:45,530
是的。我会表现得好像我拥有所有的东西和所有的人我的行为不会有任何后果。
Yeah. I'll just act like I own everything and everyone and there's no repercussions for my actions.

767
00:40:47,455 --> 00:40:49,633
♬我就是这样做的…♪
♪ I do it like that... ♪

768
00:40:50,997 --> 00:40:53,934
我的天啊。是汤姆·赖德吗?
Oh, my God. Is that Tom Ryder?

769
00:40:53,934 --> 00:40:55,199
嗨,汤姆!
Hey, Tom!

770
00:40:57,267 --> 00:40:59,335
特技演员!是的，是的，伊基说你要来看我。
Stuntman! Yeah, yeah, Iggy said you were gonna come see me.

771
00:40:59,335 --> 00:41:00,842
是的，坐下，喝一杯。
Yeah, sit down, get a drink.

772
00:41:00,842 --> 00:41:01,975
喂，喂，给他拿杯喝的。你想要什么?
Hey, hey, get him a drink. What do you want?

773
00:41:01,975 --> 00:41:03,438
不，不，我很好。我很好。
Oh, no, no, I'm good. I'm good.

774
00:41:03,438 --> 00:41:05,484
我只是在找莱德。你见过他吗?
I'm just looking for Ryder. You seen him?

775
00:41:06,916 --> 00:41:09,114
给他一杯秀兰·邓波儿。坐下，兄弟，坐下。
Get him a Shirley Temple. Sit down, brother, sit down.

776
00:41:09,114 --> 00:41:11,446
说实话，无意冒犯，杜恩先生。
Uh, honestly, no offense, Mr. Doone.

777
00:41:11,446 --> 00:41:13,316
我只想找到莱德。
I just want to find Ryder.

778
00:41:13,316 --> 00:41:16,253
为什么没人愿意和毒贩聊天?
How come no one ever wants to chat with the drug dealer?

779
00:41:19,423 --> 00:41:24,492
对不起。我,嗯…我是说不……没有不尊重。
Sorry. I, uh... I mean no... no disrespect.

780
00:41:24,492 --> 00:41:26,494
只是度过了漫长的一天。莱德没来上班。
Just had a long day. Ryder hasn't shown up to work.

781
00:41:26,494 --> 00:41:28,166
真是太快了。
That was fast.

782
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:29,640
你今天要表演特技?
You do a stunt today?

783
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,235
呃，只是一个，是的，汽车滚动。
Uh, just a, yeah, car roll.

784
00:41:31,235 --> 00:41:32,742
-只是一个汽车滚?
- Just a car roll?

785
00:41:32,742 --> 00:41:35,008
听到他是怎么说的吗?“只是一个汽车滚!”
Hear how he said that? "Just a car roll!"

786
00:41:35,008 --> 00:41:36,911
真是个特技演员!我的男人!
What a stuntman! My man!

787
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,682
这就是我的工作。
It's what I do.

788
00:41:38,682 --> 00:41:39,848
这就是我喜欢你的原因。
Hey, that's why I like you.

789
00:41:39,848 --> 00:41:41,410
因为辛苦的事都是你干的。
'Cause you do all the hard shit.

790
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:44,017
他们为此颁发奥斯卡奖?
They give Oscars for that?

791
00:41:44,017 --> 00:41:45,920
特技?
For stunts?

792
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,724
不。
No.

793
00:41:47,724 --> 00:41:49,154
不。
Nope.

794
00:41:49,154 --> 00:41:51,321
嘿，向无名英雄致敬。
Hey, to the unsung heroes.

795
00:41:51,321 --> 00:41:53,125
-我要为此干一杯。-是的。
- I'll drink to that. -  Yeah.

796
00:41:55,228 --> 00:41:56,997
毫米!
Mm!

797
00:41:58,361 --> 00:42:00,033
无意冒犯，但我更喜欢动画片。
No offense, but I prefer cartoons.

798
00:42:00,033 --> 00:42:02,871
看，电影总是试图让事情变得真实。
See, movies are always trying to make things real.

799
00:42:02,871 --> 00:42:04,675
但这不是真的。这是一部电影。
But it's not real. It's a movie.

800
00:42:04,675 --> 00:42:06,534
它不应该是真实的。
It's not meant to be real.

801
00:42:06,534 --> 00:42:08,272
-这就是我喜欢动画片的原因。
- That's why I like cartoons.

802
00:42:08,272 --> 00:42:10,780
看，因为卡通不会假装真实。
See, 'cause cartoons don't pretend to be real.

803
00:42:12,441 --> 00:42:14,410
这就是我喜欢他们的地方。你看过小飞象吗?
That's what I like about them. You seen Dumbo?

804
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:15,950
——傻瓜?-是的，小飞象。
- Dumbo? - Yeah, Dumbo.

805
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,853
小飞象改变了我的生活。
Dumbo changed my life.

806
00:42:17,853 --> 00:42:22,418
你知道小飞象喝了劣质香槟，然后开始看到粉色大象在游行的那一幕吗?
You know that scene when Dumbo gets into the bad champagne, then he starts seeing the pink elephants on parade and shit?

807
00:42:22,418 --> 00:42:23,628
我说:“好的，请。
I was like, "Yes, please.

808
00:42:23,628 --> 00:42:25,091
“他吃的我也要吃!”
"I'll have what he's having!

809
00:42:25,091 --> 00:42:26,521
要双份的!”
Make it a double!"

810
00:42:27,731 --> 00:42:29,601
嘿,特技演员?
Hey, stuntman?

811
00:42:29,601 --> 00:42:31,295
-为什么不和我们一起去呢?
- Why don't you come with us?

812
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,737
我们会让你在酒店舒适舒适的，嗯?
We'll get you nice and comfortable at the hotel, huh?

813
00:43:19,213 --> 00:43:22,214
动,动!让开!得到,动!来吧!
Move, move! Get out of the way! Get-- Move! Come on!

814
00:43:23,547 --> 00:43:26,251
让开!动!放开我!
Get out the way! Move! Get off me!

815
00:43:26,251 --> 00:43:27,516
嘿!
Hey!

816
00:43:31,962 --> 00:43:33,423
快走，快走，快走!出租车!加油！加油。
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Taxi! Come on, come on.

817
00:43:33,423 --> 00:43:34,831
来吧，兄弟，我们走。
Come on, brother, let's go.

818
00:43:34,831 --> 00:43:37,163
——走吧!-再见，伙计。-保重，伙计。
- Go! -See you, mate. - Be well, mate.

819
00:43:47,307 --> 00:43:48,977
你在干什么，科特?
What are you doing, Colt?

820
00:43:48,977 --> 00:43:51,474
你知道我在做什么。我要停下这辆车。
You know what I'm doing. I'm gonna stop this car.

821
00:43:51,474 --> 00:43:54,279
你明显是嗨了，科特。而你显然是胆小鬼!
You're clearly high, Colt. And you're clearly chickenshit!

822
00:43:54,279 --> 00:43:56,347
好了，我们没时间了。这个以后再谈。
Okay, we don't have time for this. Talk about this later.

823
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:06,995
是的,好的。司机，你在干什么?
Yeah, okay. Driver, what are you doing?

824
00:44:06,995 --> 00:44:09,294
开车!开车,兄弟!
Drive! Drive, bro!

825
00:44:09,294 --> 00:44:15,333
听。嘿，你需要冷静。只是放松。嘿，放松点!我是爱人，不是斗士，好吗?只是…-莱德在哪儿?!-我给你下药是因为他们付钱给我
Listen. Hey, you need to chill. Just relax. Just re-- Hey, just relax! I'm a lover, not a fighter, okay? Just... - Where's Ryder?! - I just drugged you 'cause they paid me to.

826
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:16,807
-“他们”是谁?
- Who's "they"?

827
00:44:16,807 --> 00:44:18,468
负责莱德安保的人。
The guy that runs Ryder's security.

828
00:44:18,468 --> 00:44:21,240
我有时会在彭德尔顿酒店给他送毒品?
I deliver drugs to him at the Pendleton Hotel sometimes, okay?

829
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,175
-什么房间?-兄弟，我不知道是哪个房间。
- What room? - Bro, I don't know what room.

830
00:44:22,175 --> 00:44:23,715
你知道的，世事无常。
You know, it changes.

831
00:44:23,715 --> 00:44:24,914
问凯文要水果盘就行了。
Just ask Kevin for the, for the fruit plate.

832
00:44:24,914 --> 00:44:26,476
-他会给你钥匙的——凯文?
- He'll give you the key. - Kevin?

833
00:44:26,476 --> 00:44:27,917
——凯文!K-E-V-I-N。为…-我认识凯文!
- Kevin! K-E-V-I-N. For the... - I know Kevin!

834
00:44:27,917 --> 00:44:28,984
你认识凯文吗?
You know Kevin?

835
00:44:28,984 --> 00:44:30,480
我不认识凯文。
I don't know Kevin.

836
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,086
那你就会认识凯文了。
Well, then you're gonna get to know Kevin.

837
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:35,188
问他要个水果盘，他会给你钥匙。
Ask him for a fruit plate, and he'll give you keys.

838
00:44:35,188 --> 00:44:36,651
这能持续多久?
How long does this last?

839
00:44:36,651 --> 00:44:38,191
——什么?-这要持续多久?
- What? - How long is this gonna last?

840
00:44:38,191 --> 00:44:39,324
兄弟，你到底在说什么?
Bro, what are you even saying?

841
00:44:39,324 --> 00:44:42,261
如何……这种情况会持续多久?
How... long does this last?

842
00:44:42,261 --> 00:44:45,099
哦。当你不再看到独角兽。
Oh. When you stop seeing unicorns.

843
00:44:49,565 --> 00:44:52,238
我想和凯文讲话。
I'd like to speak to Kevin.

844
00:44:52,238 --> 00:44:54,504
凯文，呃，在休息。
Kevin's, uh, on a break.

845
00:44:54,504 --> 00:44:57,914
好吧，也许你能帮我。我可以点“水果盘”吗?
Okay, maybe you can help me. Can I order the "fruit plate"?

846
00:44:57,914 --> 00:45:01,786
好吧。要我叫客房服务吗?
Okay. Do you want me to call "room service"?

847
00:45:01,786 --> 00:45:03,678
我不知道。是这样吗?
I don't know. Is that what happens?

848
00:45:03,678 --> 00:45:04,888
你有房间吗?
D-Do you have a room?

849
00:45:04,888 --> 00:45:06,384
-我应该…-我需要吗?
- Should I just... - Do I need one?

850
00:45:06,384 --> 00:45:08,793
订购……——我……-水果盘。
To order the fr... - I... - The fruit plate.

851
00:45:08,793 --> 00:45:09,827
-嘿，柯尔特。-水果盘。
- Hey, Colt. - Fruit plate.

852
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:11,895
汪,哇。
Woof, wow.

853
00:45:11,895 --> 00:45:13,963
-这样子不错。-嗨。嘿。
- That's a look. - Hi. Hey.

854
00:45:13,963 --> 00:45:15,294
-你的脸怎么了?-嗨。
- What happened to your face? - Hi.

855
00:45:15,294 --> 00:45:16,867
-嗨。好吧。
- Hi. Okay.

856
00:45:16,867 --> 00:45:18,363
-很抱歉。-你还好吗?
- Sorry about that. - Are you good?

857
00:45:18,363 --> 00:45:19,870
-挺好的…-你怎么了?
- It's just good... - What's wrong with you?

858
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:20,772
-很高兴见到你。-哇，你看起来糟透了。
- It's good to see you. - Wow, you look terrible.

859
00:45:20,772 --> 00:45:22,103
你看起来棒极了。
You look amazing.

860
00:45:22,103 --> 00:45:23,566
你摔倒了吗?你怎么了?
Did you fall? What happened to you?

861
00:45:23,566 --> 00:45:25,271
哇。你真漂亮。
Wow. You're so pretty.

862
00:45:25,271 --> 00:45:26,635
-太疯狂了。——好的。你的脸在流血。
-  It's crazy. - Okay. Your face is bleeding.

863
00:45:26,635 --> 00:45:28,604
——什么?-你怎么了?
- What? - What happened to you?

864
00:45:28,604 --> 00:45:30,639
哦。不，我在跑步。我只是在跑步。
Oh. No, I was running. Just-- I was running.

865
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:32,949
非常不寻常的跑步运动休闲装。
Very unusual athleisure wear for a run.

866
00:45:32,949 --> 00:45:34,577
——这?-是的。
-  This? - Yeah.

867
00:45:34,577 --> 00:45:38,449
是的，他们在机场给了我错的包，但是，你知道，这是有效的。
Yeah, they gave me the wrong bags at the airport, but, you know, it's-- it works.

868
00:45:38,449 --> 00:45:39,956
我会出汗。
I can sweat.

869
00:45:39,956 --> 00:45:43,960
如果我要演莱德，我想我应该，比如，稍微减肥一下，你知道的……你看起来有点神经质。
If I'm gonna play Ryder, I thought I should just, like, cut weight a little, you know... You seem kind of tweaky.

870
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,556
我有点…参差不齐的。
I'm a little... spotty.

871
00:45:46,556 --> 00:45:49,229
比如，当我的血糖水平很低的时候。
Like, when I-- my glucose levels get low.

872
00:45:49,229 --> 00:45:53,761
我有点…-好吧，这是新事物吗?
I get a little... - Okay, is that a new thing?

873
00:45:53,761 --> 00:45:55,301
这是新事物吗?
Is that a new thing?

874
00:45:55,301 --> 00:45:56,599
-那是什么?-这是新事物吗?
- What's that? - Is that a new thing?

875
00:45:56,599 --> 00:45:58,271
-你的头发是新的吗?-是的，我剪了。
- Is your hair new? - Yes, I cut it.

876
00:45:58,271 --> 00:45:59,635
-我换了发型。-很漂亮。
- I changed my hair. - It's beautiful.

877
00:45:59,635 --> 00:46:01,142
你换了电话号码。我们扯平了。
You changed your number. We're even.

878
00:46:01,142 --> 00:46:03,507
我以为我们能扳平比分。
I thought we'd sort of even the score.

879
00:46:03,507 --> 00:46:09,117
是的。我有很多新的你知道，自从我们上次见面后，我对自己有了更多的了解。
Yeah. I have a lot of new s-- You know, I've learned a lot about myself since-since we last seen each other.

880
00:46:09,117 --> 00:46:10,855
你为什么就那样消失了?
Why'd you disappear like that?

881
00:46:10,855 --> 00:46:13,055
天啊，我想陪在你身边。
God, I wanted to be there for you.

882
00:46:14,553 --> 00:46:18,093
是啊，但如果你一直骚扰她，她怎么可能完成高质量的工作?
Yeah, but how's she supposed to do quality work if you keep harassing her all the time?

883
00:46:20,425 --> 00:46:22,493
好吧。你能去拿你的东西吗?
Okay. Can you go and grab your things?

884
00:46:22,493 --> 00:46:24,836
-我们真的得抓紧时间了。——好的。是的。
- We have really got to zip. - Okay. Yep.

885
00:46:24,836 --> 00:46:26,200
-怎么回事?——认真。
- What's going on? - Seriously.

886
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:30,369
-科特，你…你看起来很忙。
- Colt, you're... You look like you've been busy.

887
00:46:30,369 --> 00:46:32,635
-是啊，很忙，盖尔。-是的，很好。
- Yeah, real busy, Gail. - Yeah, good.

888
00:46:32,635 --> 00:46:33,845
到处乱跑，盖尔。
Lot of running around, Gail.

889
00:46:33,845 --> 00:46:35,770
我们去喝一杯，然后再讨论。
We'll get a drink and discuss that.

890
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:39,543
但现在，工作室…在我的屁股上，我都能尝到。
But right now, the studio... so far up my ass, I can taste them.

891
00:46:39,543 --> 00:46:41,116
-我们需要你的第三幕。——好的。是的。
- We need your third act. - Okay. Yep.

892
00:46:41,116 --> 00:46:42,711
你对第三幕有意见吗?
You having problems with the third act?

893
00:46:42,711 --> 00:46:44,449
我们，我们现在就去做点什么。
We're gonna, we're gonna go and do things right now.

894
00:46:44,449 --> 00:46:51,357
我需要把它写下来。我要去写了。就好像制片方想让我扭曲这个爱情故事，好让一切都有个美好的结局……
I need to write it. I'm gonna go write it. I just-- It's like the studio are wanting me to contort the love story so that it all ends happily and everything's rosy and...

895
00:46:51,357 --> 00:46:56,296
-乔迪，乔迪，乔迪-但我觉得如果我…面对现实，也许这才是正确的选择。
- Jody, Jody, Jody. - But I feel like if I... lean into reality, then maybe that's the way to go.

896
00:46:56,296 --> 00:46:59,068
大多数爱情故事都没有好结局。通常。
And most love stories don't end well. Usually.

897
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:05,503
-明白我的意思吗?-我非常不同意，所以我们应该继续把它切碎。
- Know what I mean? - I strongly disagree with that, so we should keep chopping it up.

898
00:47:05,503 --> 00:47:06,735
是吗?我们应该吗?
Yeah? Should we?

899
00:47:06,735 --> 00:47:08,913
这很重要。这是结局。
It's important. It's the ending.

900
00:47:08,913 --> 00:47:10,574
——好的。
- Okay.

901
00:47:12,378 --> 00:47:14,083
先生?
Sir?

902
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:15,414
——嗯?-嗨。
- Huh? - Hi.

903
00:47:15,414 --> 00:47:16,679
-是的。-嗨。
- Yeah. - Hi.

904
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:20,518
我听说你对水果拼盘很感兴趣。
Um, I hear that you're interested in a-a fruit platter.

905
00:47:20,518 --> 00:47:21,992
——凯文?——是的。
-  Kevin? -  Yes.

906
00:47:21,992 --> 00:47:26,898
是的。好吧,所以…这是没办法……它在冰上。
Yes. Okay, so... It's-it's on... it's on ice.

907
00:47:47,413 --> 00:47:49,745
是的。好了。对不起。
Yep. There we go. Sorry.

908
00:48:35,166 --> 00:48:36,825
喂?
Hello?

909
00:48:36,825 --> 00:48:38,332
你对分屏有什么看法?
What do you think about split screen?

910
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,400
——乔迪?-是的。
- Jody? - Yeah.

911
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,174
我打电话可以吗?你让我打电话来的……——是的。是的，很好。——是吗?我们可以把它切碎?
Is this okay I'm calling? You said to call and... - Yes. Yeah, it's fine. - Yeah? We could chop it up?

912
00:48:45,174 --> 00:48:47,242
这是,呃…让我们把它切碎。
It's, uh... Let's chop it up.

913
00:48:47,242 --> 00:48:48,639
这是一个美好的时光。我什么都没做。
It's a good time. I'm not doing anything.

914
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:51,774
好吧。太好了。分屏，对吧?
Okay. Great. Uh, so, split screen, right?

915
00:48:51,774 --> 00:48:59,287
你觉得这是怀旧的超级酷还是你觉得这是个噱头?-嗯，我觉得会很酷。
Do you think that it's, like, nostalgic super cool or do you think it's a gimmick? - Um, I think it could be super cool.

916
00:48:59,287 --> 00:49:02,092
嗯哼?-是的，你想怎么用它?
Mm-hmm? -Yeah, how do you, uh, want to use it?

917
00:49:02,092 --> 00:49:04,490
我是说，你知道，告诉我。告诉我一切。
I mean, you know, tell me. Tell me everything.

918
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:06,756
跟我说说，你的幻象。
Tell me, you know, about your vision.

919
00:49:06,756 --> 00:49:08,692
所以，我喜欢他们一起出现在屏幕上。
So, I like that they're on-screen together.

920
00:49:08,692 --> 00:49:10,430
但他们是在不同的世界……-对。
But they are in separate worlds... -Right.

921
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:12,531
．..无论是视觉上还是情感上。
...you know, visually and emotionally.

922
00:49:12,531 --> 00:49:16,205
所以这对恋人之间的分歧非常明显。
So you've got this very prominent divide between the lovers.

923
00:49:16,205 --> 00:49:17,668
我想要那样。
And I want that.

924
00:49:20,805 --> 00:49:23,410
-你想要分?-我想要分割，是的。
- You want the divide? - I want the divide, yes.

925
00:49:26,085 --> 00:49:27,711
嗯。
Hmm.

926
00:49:27,711 --> 00:49:31,385
很有趣，因为我不觉得他们之间有那么多隔阂。
It's funny 'cause I-I didn't get the impression that there was that much keeping them apart.

927
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,486
你还没读过剧本。
Well, you haven't read the script.

928
00:49:34,984 --> 00:49:41,494
到目前为止，我所知道的是外星女人和牛仔之间的问题似乎还可以解决。
All I know so far is that the alien lady and the cowboy are having what seem to be pretty manageable problems.

929
00:49:41,494 --> 00:49:44,299
乔迪?乔:这是怎么回事?
Jody? Jod-- How's this?

930
00:49:44,299 --> 00:49:45,894
可控的问题?
Manageable problems?

931
00:49:45,894 --> 00:49:47,995
外星人入侵了地球，把地球弄得支离破碎。
The aliens invaded Earth, and they left it in tatters.

932
00:49:47,995 --> 00:49:53,704
所以电影公司所推行的“爱能征服一切”的理念……我才不信呢。
So this whole thing the studio are pushing for, the "love conquers all" thing... I'm not buying it.

933
00:49:53,704 --> 00:49:56,971
我得承认我很惊讶你会这么说。
Well, I have to admit that I'm surprised to hear you say that.

934
00:49:56,971 --> 00:49:58,808
为什么?
Why?

935
00:49:58,808 --> 00:50:08,818
我只是一个穿着霓虹灯套装的男孩站在一个女孩面前，提醒她《诺丁山》是她最喜欢的电影她每年圣诞节都会看《真爱至上》
Well, I'm just a boy in a neon suit standing in front of a girl, reminding her that Notting Hill is her favorite movie and she watches Love Actually every year at Christmas.

936
00:50:08,818 --> 00:50:13,262
你知道吗，今年我又看了一遍，其实我并不喜欢。
Well, you know, I watched it again this year, and I didn't love it, actually.

937
00:50:13,262 --> 00:50:15,099
-哇，比我想象的还要糟。-是啊，我毁了。
- Wow, it's worse than I thought. - Yeah, I'm ruined.

938
00:50:15,099 --> 00:50:17,266
是啊，这对诺丁山来说也是悲伤的一天。
Yeah, it's a really sad day for Notting Hill as well.

939
00:50:17,266 --> 00:50:19,433
那种"从此幸福地生活在一起"的东西，取消订阅吧。
That "happily ever after" stuff, unsubscribe me.

940
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,105
我没有从诺丁山得到"从此幸福地生活在一起"
I didn't get "happily ever after" from Notting Hill.

941
00:50:21,105 --> 00:50:22,568
你在说什么?当然了。
What are you talking about? Of course you did.

942
00:50:22,568 --> 00:50:26,209
-是吗?-是的，当然。他们在——他们在公园的长椅上。她把头伸进了他的膝盖。
- Did you? - Yes, of course. They're ly-- They're on the park bench. She's got her head in his knee.

943
00:50:26,209 --> 00:50:27,408
她是个“普通女孩”。
She's a "regular girl."

944
00:50:27,408 --> 00:50:31,412
也许吧，但我们不确定她会不会回去当警察。
Maybe, but we don't know for sure she's not gonna go back to working the street.

945
00:50:31,412 --> 00:50:36,417
我们所知道的是，一开始，她几乎什么都不愿意，但最后，她愿意吻他。
All we know is that in the beginning, she's pretty much up for anything but kissing, and in the end, she's open to kissing him.

946
00:50:36,417 --> 00:50:38,518
——没有。不。-它给了我们希望。
-  No. No. - And it gives us hope.

947
00:50:38,518 --> 00:50:40,014
你的茱莉亚·罗伯茨电影太扭曲了。
You have got your Julia Roberts movies so twisted.

948
00:50:40,014 --> 00:50:41,257
这就是我们想要的。一点希望。
And that's all we want. A little hope.

949
00:50:41,257 --> 00:50:46,262
不，那是《风月俏佳人》，她是夜猫子，而这是《诺丁山》，她是著名的女演员。
No, that is Pretty Woman, where she is a lady of the night, and this is Notting Hill, where she's a very famous actress.

950
00:50:46,262 --> 00:50:47,758
哦。别听我的。
Oh. Well, don't listen to me.

951
00:50:47,758 --> 00:50:49,892
我知道什么?听着，你是导演。
What do I know? Look, you're the director.

952
00:50:49,892 --> 00:50:51,234
你会做出正确的选择。
You're gonna make the right choice.

953
00:50:51,234 --> 00:50:54,963
我只是想说，对于像我这样的人来说，他们不一定能理解分屏的比喻。
I'm just saying, for people like me, who may not necessarily get the metaphor of the split screen.

954
00:50:54,963 --> 00:50:58,241
你可能听不懂更深层次的比喻，但你会明白的。
You may not get the deeper metaphor, but you're gonna see it.

955
00:50:58,241 --> 00:51:02,905
你会看到它们之间的明线我们会看到模糊的。
You're gonna see this bright line between them that we're gonna ache to see blur.

956
00:51:02,905 --> 00:51:04,709
你知道，但也许它不能。
You know, but maybe it can't.

957
00:51:04,709 --> 00:51:07,041
-嗯-也许不是
- Mm. - Maybe it doesn't.

958
00:51:07,041 --> 00:51:09,780
正确的。正确的。是的。
Right. Right. Yeah.

959
00:51:11,551 --> 00:51:13,619
但是我们知道什么，对吧?
But what do we know, right?

960
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:17,953
因为我们现在只知道牛仔喜欢外星人。
'Cause all we know at this point is that the cowboy likes the alien.

961
00:51:17,953 --> 00:51:19,394
外星人喜欢牛仔吗?
Does the alien like the cowboy?

962
00:51:19,394 --> 00:51:21,297
她持观望态度。
She's on the fence.

963
00:51:21,297 --> 00:51:22,562
正确的。
Right.

964
00:51:22,562 --> 00:51:24,597
因为他们有问题。
Because they got problems.

965
00:51:24,597 --> 00:51:29,140
因为她是个外星人，而他是个牛仔，这就是问题所在。
Because she's an alien and he's a cowboy, and that's a problem.

966
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:30,768
但这是一个他们无法克服的问题吗?
But is it a problem they can't overcome?

967
00:51:30,768 --> 00:51:32,407
我有个问题。
Here's a question.

968
00:51:32,407 --> 00:51:35,245
他们会尝试吗?
Are they even gonna try?

969
00:51:35,245 --> 00:51:36,774
你觉得呢?
What do you think?

970
00:51:38,008 --> 00:51:40,041
你觉得他们会尝试吗?
Do you think they're gonna try?

971
00:51:41,451 --> 00:51:47,356
我认为……我认为这是一次很棒的头脑风暴。
I think... I think this was a great brainstorm.

972
00:51:50,823 --> 00:51:55,793
所以…你觉得分屏怎么样?
So... what'd you decide about the split screen?

973
00:51:55,793 --> 00:51:57,630
我有个更好的主意。
I have a better idea.

974
00:51:59,093 --> 00:52:00,930
我认为你不需要它。
I don't think you need it.

975
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:05,572
我认为这些角色之间的联系是如此强烈，没有什么能把他们分开。
I think the connection between these characters is so strong that nothing can come between them.

976
00:52:06,971 --> 00:52:08,509
工作吗?
Jod?

977
00:52:09,875 --> 00:52:11,039
乔迪?
Jody?

978
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:36,900
-你好吗?-冰上的死人。
-Hello? - Dead guy on ice.

979
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,539
怎么啦？
What?

980
00:52:38,539 --> 00:52:42,213
酒店里有个死人被冻住了，盖尔。
There's a dead guy on ice at the hotel, Gail.

981
00:52:42,213 --> 00:52:44,039
等待。对不起。你在说什么?
Wait. Sorry. What are you talking about?

982
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:47,317
如果你觉得这说不通，就别点水果盘了。-等等。
Well, if you think that doesn't make sense, - don't order the fruit plate. - Hold on.

983
00:52:47,317 --> 00:52:49,143
你真的要告诉我你看到了一具尸体吗?
You're seriously telling me you've just seen a dead body?

984
00:52:49,143 --> 00:52:50,848
是的,盖尔。
Yes, Gail.

985
00:52:50,848 --> 00:52:53,422
加冰。在旅馆里。
On the rocks. In the hotel.

986
00:52:53,422 --> 00:52:54,687
什么酒店?
What hotel?

987
00:52:54,687 --> 00:52:56,656
我刚看到你在里面，盖尔!
The one I just saw you in, Gail!

988
00:52:56,656 --> 00:52:58,229
他已经死了，盖尔。
He was so dead, Gail.

989
00:52:58,229 --> 00:53:00,330
他已经死了。超级死了。
He was very dead. Super dead.

990
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:01,760
等一等。你是怎么到那里的?
Hold on. How did you even get there?

991
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,158
盖尔，是你让我这么做的!好吧?
Gail, you asked me to do this! Okay?

992
00:53:04,158 --> 00:53:06,699
-所以请努力跟上。-我知道。我坚持。
- So please try and keep up. - I know. I'm sticking.

993
00:53:06,699 --> 00:53:09,339
我照你说的去了莱德的公寓。
I went to Ryder's apartment just like you told me.

994
00:53:09,339 --> 00:53:14,377
所以拿剑的伊基给了我一套霓虹灯套装他们让我去见那个豹纹头的人。
That's where Iggy with the sword gave me the neon suit and they sent me to the man with the leopard print head.

995
00:53:14,377 --> 00:53:16,280
他的名字是杜恩。
He goes by the name of Doone.

996
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:19,943
是杜恩的打手玷污了我的雪莉，而且不是以有趣的方式，盖尔。
It was Doone's goons who dirtied my Shirley, and not in a fun way, Gail.

997
00:53:19,943 --> 00:53:22,209
我觉得他们想杀了我，盖尔!
I think they were trying to kill me, Gail!

998
00:53:22,209 --> 00:53:24,387
走开，冷静下来。
Step away and calm down.

999
00:53:24,387 --> 00:53:26,048
我来处理一切。
I am gonna handle everything.

1000
00:53:26,048 --> 00:53:27,522
-不要再搬运了!
- No more handling!

1001
00:53:27,522 --> 00:53:29,392
-我要警察!-你太好斗了。
- I want the police! - You're very aggressive.

1002
00:53:29,392 --> 00:53:31,757
我很抱歉。对不起，我吼了。我要叫警察。
I'm sorry. I'm sorry to yell. I want the police.

1003
00:53:31,757 --> 00:53:33,462
你不会跟警察说的。
You are not gonna talk to the police.

1004
00:53:33,462 --> 00:53:36,223
别跟任何人说这件事，好吗?你听我说。-我要报警了
You don't talk to anyone about this, okay? - - You listen to me. - I'm calling the police.

1005
00:53:36,223 --> 00:53:37,598
你不能跟警察说话。
You are not talking to the police.

1006
00:53:37,598 --> 00:53:39,094
-打扰一下，先生-等等，谁在那儿?
- Excuse me, sir. -Wait, who's there?

1007
00:53:39,094 --> 00:53:40,436
谁在那里？谁在那里？
Who's there? Who's there?

1008
00:53:40,436 --> 00:53:41,767
是警察。我要和他们谈谈。
It's the police. I'm gonna talk to them.

1009
00:53:41,767 --> 00:53:42,999
不，不，不，不!不要说话…
No, no, no, no, no! Don't talk...

1010
00:53:45,135 --> 00:53:47,971
任何时候都禁止停车。
No parking at any time.

1011
00:53:51,944 --> 00:53:54,109
对不起。
Sorry.

1012
00:53:54,109 --> 00:53:55,484
只是想确定我们都在这里。
Just making sure we're both here.

1013
00:53:56,454 --> 00:53:57,552
我在这里，伙计。
I'm-I'm here, mate.

1014
00:53:57,552 --> 00:53:59,455
我要报案。
I want to report a crime.

1015
00:53:59,455 --> 00:54:01,083
——好的。-冰上犯罪。
- Okay. - An ice crime.

1016
00:54:07,221 --> 00:54:09,894
是的。你还是会被罚的，伙计。
Yeah. You're still getting a ticket, mate.

1017
00:54:09,894 --> 00:54:11,269
好吧。
All right.

1018
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:16,230
我得告诉乔迪。
I got to tell Jody.

1019
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:17,572
关于那个死人。
About the dead guy.

1020
00:54:17,572 --> 00:54:18,837
你怎么知道他死了?
How do you know he was dead?

1021
00:54:18,837 --> 00:54:20,267
他可能只是被打晕了。
He could've just been knocked out.

1022
00:54:20,267 --> 00:54:21,675
-在冰上?-是的。
- On ice? - Yeah.

1023
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:24,777
冰浴对消炎很有效。
Ice baths are very good for inflammation.

1024
00:54:24,777 --> 00:54:27,109
你忘了你嗑药了吗?
And are you forgetting that you were high?

1025
00:54:27,109 --> 00:54:31,685
如果你一直盯着那一点不放，我怎么能?-好吧，我先打断你一下。
How can I if you keep fixating - on that one point? - Okay, you know what, let me just stop you right there.

1026
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,952
不管你昨晚跟乔迪说了什么，她都很生气。-我不知道我说了什么。
Whatever you told Jody last night - has got her all fired up. - I don't know what I said.

1027
00:54:34,952 --> 00:54:36,360
关于什么?
About what?

1028
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,990
现在我要造一辆卡车，用来跳250英尺。——嗯?
And now I have to build a truck - for a 250-foot jump. - Huh?

1029
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:41,926
-一天半以后!-听起来真的很酷。
- In a day and a half! - Sounds pretty cool, actually.

1030
00:54:41,926 --> 00:54:46,865
最重要的是，今天的打斗戏，乔迪决定一次拍完。
And on top of that, the fight scene today, Jody has decided that she wants to do it all in one take.

1031
00:54:46,865 --> 00:54:49,131
猛烈的一击。-Dan，你告诉他关于oner的事了吗?
A oner. -Dan, did you tell him about the oner?

1032
00:54:49,131 --> 00:54:50,440
——是的。-太酷了。
- Yes. - So cool.

1033
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:51,639
——对吗?-是的。
- Right? - Yeah.

1034
00:54:51,639 --> 00:54:53,300
-太好了。他很喜欢。-嗨。
- So good. He's into it. - Hi.

1035
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:57,612
嘿。我能跟你谈谈吗?-好吧，关于今天的镜头，莱德不会来了。-是的。
Hey. Yeah, can I talk to you for a second? -Okay, about this sequence today, Ryder's a no-show. -Yeah.

1036
00:54:57,612 --> 00:54:59,009
他可能又喝醉了还是怎么的。
Again, he's probably on a bender or something.

1037
00:54:59,009 --> 00:55:01,847
嗯，你这么说很有趣，因为那是…-是的。
Well, it's interesting you say that, - because that's... - Yeah.

1038
00:55:01,847 --> 00:55:03,783
．..这就是我想跟你说的。加。
...that's what I want to talk to you about. -Me, too.

1039
00:55:03,783 --> 00:55:07,149
我也是。因为我们根本不需要他。他……嗯…-我们不需要他。昨晚我有了一个顿悟。
Me, too. Because we don't even need him. -He... Well... -We don't need him. I had an epiphany last night.

1040
00:55:07,149 --> 00:55:08,392
让我来告诉你。
Let me just tell you.

1041
00:55:08,392 --> 00:55:09,987
-昨晚?-我太兴奋了。
- Last night? - I was so excited.

1042
00:55:09,987 --> 00:55:12,396
是的。-我们谈过之后，我就明白了。
Yeah. -After we spoke, it all came to me.

1043
00:55:12,396 --> 00:55:16,158
真的吗?-是的，第三幕，这一段-全部。我一直在……-跟我谈过之后?
Really? -Yeah, the third act, this sequence, - all of it. I've been s... - After talking to me?

1044
00:55:16,158 --> 00:55:19,062
是的。你知道吗，你出现的时候我很震惊。对吧?-是的。
Yeah. You know, I was shocked - when you showed up. Right? - Yeah.

1045
00:55:19,062 --> 00:55:21,570
,但是……-嗯，那是…令人震惊。
- But... - Well, it was... shocking.

1046
00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:29,072
但我开始怀疑也许你出现的正是时候，然后…我一直在行动中追求这个东西，但我从来没能得到它。
But I just started to wonder if maybe you showed up just at the right time, and... I've been going for this thing in the action, and I've never been able to get it.

1047
00:55:29,072 --> 00:55:31,844
喜欢，这种追求爱情的感觉。
Like, this feeling of the pursuit of love.

1048
00:55:31,844 --> 00:55:41,183
为了你爱的人，你会走多远?-你知道吗?然后……是的。-你知道，我知道和莱德在一起不是很远，-因为他是个笨蛋。——正确的。
And how far would you go for the one that you love and... -You know? And then... Yeah. -You know, I realize it's not very far with Ryder, - 'cause he's a drip. - Right.

1049
00:55:41,183 --> 00:55:42,822
-他跑起来怪怪的。——正确的。
- And he runs weird. - Right.

1050
00:55:42,822 --> 00:55:45,924
-他不会做动作。但是…-嗯，是... ...你可以。
- And he can't do action. But... - Well, it's... ...you can.

1051
00:55:45,924 --> 00:55:47,222
-你可以的。
- You can.

1052
00:55:47,222 --> 00:55:48,762
我对你是无限的。
I'm unlimited with you.

1053
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:54,900
我可以和你做任何事，任何事，这让我的大脑…太酷了。
I can do everything and everything with you, and it just made my brain just... So cool.

1054
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,231
我不需要割伤。我不需要噱头。-真的?
I don't need cuts. I don't need gimmicks. -Really?

1055
00:55:56,231 --> 00:55:58,233
我什么都不需要。我只是需要你。
I don't need anything. I just need you.

1056
00:55:58,233 --> 00:55:59,938
-看完这部电影。
- To finish this movie.

1057
00:55:59,938 --> 00:56:02,237
也许还能拍成一部好电影。-哇。
You know, maybe even make it a great movie. -Wow.

1058
00:56:02,237 --> 00:56:03,579
你知道吗?
You know?

1059
00:56:03,579 --> 00:56:05,779
——哇。好吧。-你觉得呢?
- Wow. Okay. - What do you think?

1060
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,550
你想一起工作吗?
Do you want to work together?

1061
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:10,047
在四小时内把悉尼歌剧院拍得满地找牙?
Shoot the shit out of Sydney Opera House in four hours?

1062
00:56:10,047 --> 00:56:11,752
- 3小时52分钟。- 3小时52分钟?
- Three hours and 52 minutes. - Three hours and 52 minutes?

1063
00:56:11,752 --> 00:56:13,083
是的。
Yeah.

1064
00:56:13,083 --> 00:56:14,524
我们还在等什么?
What are we waiting for?

1065
00:56:14,524 --> 00:56:16,757
好的,很好。好!好吧!
Okay, good. Good! Okay!

1066
00:56:16,757 --> 00:56:18,561
大杯，大杯，来吧。
Venti, Venti, come on.

1067
00:56:18,561 --> 00:56:22,389
我要在你脸上画点，因为我需要你，但不是你的脸。-哦,上帝。对，把它处理掉。
I'm gonna get some dots on your face, 'cause I need you but not your face. -Oh, God. Get-- Yeah, just get rid of it.

1068
00:56:22,389 --> 00:56:25,931
对，我要把赖德的头塞到你身上。-全部。-好吧。酷。好吧,好吧。-是的。好吧。是的。
Yeah, I'm gonna stick Ryder's head on you. -All of it. Just-- - Okay. Cool. Okay, okay. - Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

1069
00:56:25,931 --> 00:56:28,571
准备好了吗?请让它下雨吧!
Ready for a take? Make it rain, please!

1070
00:56:32,201 --> 00:56:33,477
看在上帝的份上，让我出去。
Let me get out, for Christ's sake.

1071
00:56:33,477 --> 00:56:34,643

00:58:35,665 --> 00:58:38,998
那真是太可怕了……——真的吗?好吧。-是啊，她是谁?
That was just so awful and... - Really? Okay. - Yeah, who's she?

1111
00:58:38,998 --> 00:58:40,362
-是的。-是的。
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1112
00:58:40,362 --> 00:58:41,770
-把枪套上。-枪套上了。
- Holster that. - It's holstered.

这是完成了。忘记。你从没见过。
It's done. Forget. You-you never saw it.

1114
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:49,547
乔迪，你喜欢克里斯蒂娜还是布兰妮?
Jody, do you like Christina or Britney?

1115
00:58:52,046 --> 00:58:53,716
我看到了。

1116
00:58:53,716 --> 00:58:56,620
-你看到手指枪了吗?-我看到手指枪了。
- You saw the finger guns? - Oh, I saw the finger guns.

1117
00:58:57,852 --> 00:58:59,282
是她挑起的。
She started it.

1118
00:58:59,282 --> 00:59:01,284
嗨。
Hi.

1119
00:59:01,284 --> 00:59:03,088
我没有，我没有吃早餐。
I didn't ha-- I didn't have breakfast.

1120
00:59:03,088 --> 00:59:04,727
是啊，你说了。
Yeah, you did.

1121
00:59:04,727 --> 00:59:06,421
我不同意。-我今天早上给你裹了一层。
I disagree. -I gave you a brekky wrap this morning.

1122
00:59:06,421 --> 00:59:10,194
严格来说，这是一顿饭的罚款-如果你想…——哦。-没事的。药给信号。
Technically, this is all meal penalty, - if you want the... - Oh. - It's fine. Just-just sign.

1123
00:59:10,194 --> 00:59:13,461
谢谢。-我只是说，不是每个人都会像我一样冷静。你知道吗?-不，我明白
Thanks. -I'm just saying, not everyone's gonna be as cool - about it as I am. You know? - No, I get it.

1124
00:59:13,461 --> 00:59:15,232
这是什么?
What is this?

1125
00:59:15,232 --> 00:59:19,467
我给你安排了5点55分的航班离开这里。好吧?
I've got you on a 5:55 flight out of here. Okay?

1126
00:59:19,467 --> 00:59:20,974
-我有车在等你。——现在?
- I have a car waiting for you. - Now?

1127
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:26,540
引擎的。是的。柯尔特……事情很严重，好吗?
Engine's on. Yeah. Colt... there is some serious shit going down, okay?

1128
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:29,312
我刚跟乔迪约了去唱卡拉ok。
I just told Jody I was gonna meet her for karaoke.

1129
00:59:29,312 --> 00:59:33,085
我把你弄到这儿来，把你弄得一团糟，我真的很尴尬。
And I'm actually embarrassed that I got you here - and got you all tangled up.

1130
00:59:33,085 --> 00:59:35,120
我只想在事态升级前把你弄出去。
I just want to get you out of here before it escalates.

1131
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,627
把你的东西收拾好。我们会。
Get your stuff together. We're going.

1132
00:59:36,627 --> 00:59:38,552
你要误飞机了。谢谢你！
You're gonna miss the flight. Thank you.

1133
00:59:38,552 --> 00:59:41,665
——对不起。-好吧，但我要迟到了，我得把莱德的狗送到日托所。
- Sorry. -Okay, but I'm late, and I got to get Ryder's dogs to daycare.

1134
00:59:41,665 --> 00:59:43,590
Fluffy需要她的燕麦浴。她得了荨麻疹。
Fluffy needs her oatmeal bath. She gets hives.

1135
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:45,900
我是不是该另找工作了，阿尔玛?
Hey, should I be looking for another job, Alma?

1136
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,902
你是莱德的助理。你一定知道。
You're Ryder's assistant. You must know.

1137
00:59:47,902 --> 00:59:52,841
我只能告诉你，如果莱德明天不来，工作室就会让我们关门大吉。
All I can tell you is that if Ryder is a no-show tomorrow, the studio will shut us down.

1138
00:59:52,841 --> 00:59:54,843
啊。可怜的乔迪。
Ugh. Poor Jody.

1139
00:59:54,843 --> 00:59:56,812
向导演监狱问好吧。
Say hello to directors' jail.

我和他合作过一部电影。

1148

真不敢相信他还留着他。

其实这更像是派对上的把戏。
Well, it's more for a party trick, really.

我最后一次见到汤姆时，一切都很正常。
So, the last time I saw Tom, everything was pretty normal.

1159
01:01:08,576 --> 01:01:13,317
他和亨利在进行某种嗑药后光着膀子的格斗比赛。
He and Henry were in some kind of drug-induced, shirtless shit-show grappling match.

1160
01:01:13,317 --> 01:01:16,023
但是第二天一早盖尔惊慌地给我打电话。
But then Gail called me early the next morning in a panic.

1161
01:01:16,023 --> 01:01:17,420
放下你正在做的事情。
Drop whatever you're doing.

1162
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:18,993
汤姆又把电话丢了。
Tom has lost his phone again.

1163
01:01:18,993 --> 01:01:24,064
所以我找到了那部手机，就是莱德的恐怖保安德雷斯勒，刚刚打电话给我说的那部手机。
So I found the phone, the one that Dressler, Ryder's creepy security goon, just called me about.

1164
01:01:24,064 --> 01:01:27,199
金属风暴的全体成员，明早6点是我们的任务时间。不要迟到。-好吧，伙计。
Metalstorm crew, we have a call time of 6:00 a. m. tomorrow. Don't be late. -All right, mate.

1165

-好的，谢谢，伙计!
- All right, thanks, mate!

1166

嘿。请来两杯龙舌兰酒。-哦,盖尔。
Hey. Two shots of tequila, please. -Ooh, Gail.

1167

-嗨。——哇。
- Hey. - Wow.

1168
01:01:33,777 --> 01:01:35,603
我以为你不喜欢来参加这种活动。
I didn't think you liked coming to these things.

1169
01:01:35,603 --> 01:01:41,752
你在说什么?我喜欢听别人糟蹋我最喜欢的歌。谢谢你！-嗯。-“杜松子酒加果汁。”
What are you talking about? I love listening to people murder my favorite songs. Thank you. - - Mmm. -"Gin and Juice."

1170
01:01:41,752 --> 01:01:43,281
我得去卡拉ok了。
I got to get to karaoke.

1171

再见，让-克劳德。
Au revoir, Jean-Claude.

你得把那东西处理掉。
You got to get rid of that thing.

1175
01:01:48,957 --> 01:01:50,420
你为什么不直接给盖尔?
Why don't you just give it to Gail?

1176
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:55,898
不管这手机里的是什么都他妈是个火箭筒能把一个人的事业炸成电影明星那么大的洞。
Whatever's on this phone is a goddamn bazooka that'll blow a movie star-sized hole through somebody's career.

1177
01:01:55,898 --> 01:01:58,395
我很高兴能把它交到一个好人手里。
I'm happy to get this into the hands of a good guy.

1178
01:01:58,395 --> 01:02:00,562
-好吧…-只要价钱合适。
- Okay... - For the right price.

1179
01:02:00,562 --> 01:02:02,300
你想卖多少钱?
What do you want for it?

1180
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:03,807
生产者信用。
A producer credit.

1181
01:02:03,807 --> 01:02:05,237
Metalstorm吗?
On Metalstorm?

1182
01:02:05,237 --> 01:02:06,304
听着，我需要职业保障，好吗?
Look, I need career protection, okay?

1183
01:02:06,304 --> 01:02:07,404
我都快被这个烫伤了。
I'm burning myself with this.

1184
01:02:07,404 --> 01:02:08,812
我是个特技演员。
I'm a stunt guy.

1185
01:02:08,812 --> 01:02:10,814
我该怎么办呢?
What am I supposed to do about it?

1186
01:02:10,814 --> 01:02:17,381
你是一个曾经和导演约会过的特技演员，似乎即将重新点燃一段短暂但传奇的热恋。
You're a stunt guy who used to date the director and seems to be getting close to rekindling some sort of short but legendary torrid love affair.

1187
01:02:17,381 --> 01:02:18,822
你觉得我们快重燃激情了吗?
Do you think we're close to rekindling?

1188
01:02:18,822 --> 01:02:22,287
我是说，我觉得……到底成交不成交?
I mean, it feels like it to me... Is it a deal or not?

1189
01:02:22,287 --> 01:02:24,927
它能帮你找到莱德。
It can help you find Ryder.

1190
01:02:24,927 --> 01:02:26,225
-我会尽力的。
- I'll do what I can.

1191
01:02:26,225 --> 01:02:27,655
我没有密码。
I don't have the passcode.

1192
01:02:27,655 --> 01:02:29,393
自己想办法，好吗，特技演员?
Just figure it out, okay, stuntman?

1193
01:02:29,393 --> 01:02:30,658
找到莱德就行。
Just find Ryder.

1194
01:02:30,658 --> 01:02:32,132
我需要你签一份保密协议。
I'm gonna need you to sign an NDA.

1195
01:02:32,132 --> 01:02:36,400
如你所知，在这个行业里……我没时间谈保密协议。我得。我唱卡拉ok要迟到了。- -
As you know, nothing in this industry... I don't have time for an NDA. I got to-- I'm late for karaoke.- -

我在做什么?我在做什么?
What am I doing? What am I doing?

1199
01:03:03,361 --> 01:03:06,199
-你说他出城了?——谁?
- You sad that he left town? - Who?

1200
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,937
——小马。-不，他没有。
- Colt. - No, he didn't.

1201
01:03:07,937 --> 01:03:10,038
他要来了。他路过来唱卡拉ok。
He's coming here. He's swinging by to sing some karaoke.

1202
01:03:10,038 --> 01:03:11,600
杨晨。不。
Jody. No.

1203
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,844
我…我把票给了他。
I... I gave him the tickets.

1204
01:03:16,343 --> 01:03:18,673
-我看到了!我看到了!
- I see it! I see it!

1205
01:03:21,084 --> 01:03:23,183
-投入你的核心。
- Engage your core.

1206
01:03:38,561 --> 01:03:40,794
我需要他把电影看完。
I need him to finish the movie.

1207
01:03:40,794 --> 01:03:43,566
你为什么不跟我说呢?
Why would-- why wouldn't you talk to me about it?

1208
01:03:49,871 --> 01:03:51,277
给我。
Give me that.

1209
01:03:52,951 --> 01:03:54,313
——好。
- Fine.

1210
01:03:54,313 --> 01:03:55,380
叫我胆小鬼。
Call me chicken.

1211
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:56,810
——嗯?
- Huh?

1212
01:03:56,810 --> 01:03:58,548
好吧。好吧，硬汉。
All right. Okay, tough guy.

1213
01:04:09,427 --> 01:04:11,396
好吧,特里。
Okay, Jean-Claude.

1214
01:04:11,396 --> 01:04:13,398
这事结束后我请你喝一杯。
I'll buy you a drink when this is over.

1215
01:04:13,398 --> 01:04:15,697
——Attaque !
- Attaque!

1216
01:04:16,865 --> 01:04:18,733
离开!的帮助!的帮助!
Get away! Help! Help!

1217
01:04:18,733 --> 01:04:21,241
你太分心了。你应该告诉我的。
You've been so distracted. You should have spoken to me.

1218
01:04:21,241 --> 01:04:22,671
这条线交叉了——不好意思。
This crossed wires-- Excuse me.

1219
01:04:22,671 --> 01:04:24,211
我能再来一杯吗?谢谢你！

这里需要帮忙。
Gonna need a hand out here.

1228
01:05:02,876 --> 01:05:04,581

-我…-谢谢。

1235
01:05:29,408 --> 01:05:30,607
我真的以为我在尽职尽责。
I really thought I was doing my job.

1236

它很好。它很好。

- But you know what? - He can do whatever he wants.

01:14:48,736 --> 01:14:51,541
我的蛋蛋湿透了。我需要一条毛巾。
My balls are drenched. I need a towel.

1395
01:14:54,370 --> 01:14:57,338
这家伙总是忘了他有麦克风。
This dude always forgets that he's mic'd.

1396
01:14:57,338 --> 01:14:59,406
-我知道。-他说了最疯狂的话。
- I know. - He says the craziest shit.

1397
01:14:59,406 --> 01:15:01,716
疯狂的狗屎。我知道，我知道。
Craziest shit. I know, I know.

1398
01:15:01,716 --> 01:15:03,751
怎么，开到飞行模式了吗?
What, is it on airplane mode?

1399
01:15:03,751 --> 01:15:11,924
如果这是《逃犯》而你是哈里森·福特坏人会步步逼近。
If this was The Fugitive and you were Harrison Ford... the bad guys would be closing in.

1400
01:15:13,827 --> 01:15:15,158
我叫战斧。
I call tomahawk.

1401
01:15:15,158 --> 01:15:16,698
-该死。-你活下去。
- Damn it. - You stay alive.

1402
01:15:16,698 --> 01:15:18,194
维持生命。
Stay alive.

1403
01:15:18,194 --> 01:15:20,064
不管要花多长时间。
No matter how long it takes.

1404
01:15:20,064 --> 01:15:25,036
无论多远，我都会找到你!
No matter how far, I will find you!

1405
01:15:25,036 --> 01:15:28,743
-最后一个莫希干人。-啊，孩子!特技!
- Last of the Mohicans. - Ah, boy! Stunts!

1406
01:15:28,743 --> 01:15:31,438
该死的。
Damn it.

1407
01:15:42,990 --> 01:15:45,485
妈的，这是橡胶吗?哦,上帝。
Shit, is this rubber? Oh, God.

1408
01:16:00,434 --> 01:16:02,645
——丹尼尔·戴·刘易斯!
- Daniel Day-Lewis!

1409
01:16:17,759 --> 01:16:19,728
杰森伯恩!
Jason Bourne!

1410
01:16:35,337 --> 01:16:37,009
巨石强森!
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson!

1411
01:16:38,342 --> 01:16:40,375
-把电话给我!
- Give me the phone!

1412
01:16:45,613 --> 01:16:47,118
电话在哪儿，替身?
Where's the phone, stuntman?

1413
01:16:47,118 --> 01:16:48,988
我们得把这手机交给警察。
We got to get this phone to the cops.

1414
01:16:48,988 --> 01:16:50,693
-好的。-这是唯一的——
-Okay. -It's the only thing--

1415
01:17:18,481 --> 01:17:19,854
嘿，小丸子!
Hey, man bun!

1416
01:17:19,854 --> 01:17:21,955
电话在哪儿，替身?
Where's the phone, stuntman?

1417
01:17:21,955 --> 01:17:25,321
特里,attaque !
Jean-Claude, attaque!

1418
01:17:35,564 --> 01:17:36,838
我要这个了。
I'm gonna take that.

1419
01:17:36,838 --> 01:17:38,367
小心点，大个子。
Be careful of that, big fella.

1420
01:17:38,367 --> 01:17:40,006
闭嘴!
Shut up!

1421
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,976
我去前门看看，确保没人在那里。
I'm gonna go out the front and make sure no one's there.

1422
01:17:42,976 --> 01:17:44,241
——好的。-好吧。
- Okay. - All right.

1423
01:17:44,241 --> 01:17:45,308
嘿，带上jeanclaude，好吗?
Hey, take Jean-Claude, would you?

1424
01:17:45,308 --> 01:17:47,541
——好的。Allons-y !
- Okay. Allons-y!

1425
01:17:49,611 --> 01:17:52,513
只有你和我，特技演员。
Just you and me, stuntman.

1426
01:17:52,513 --> 01:17:54,218
大便。
Shit.

1427
01:18:05,528 --> 01:18:07,165
柯尔特的下来。
Colt's down.

1428
01:18:07,165 --> 01:18:10,333
不过大家伙跑了。
Big fella got away, though.

1429
01:18:10,333 --> 01:18:12,137
啊哈。
Uh-huh.

1430
01:18:18,882 --> 01:18:21,982
你能做到的。你能做到的。你能做到的!
You can make it. You can make it. You can make it!

1431
01:18:22,952 --> 01:18:25,051
不!太危险了!
No! It's too dangerous!

1432
01:18:25,051 --> 01:18:26,756
一定是楼梯。
Got to be stairs.

1433
01:18:26,756 --> 01:18:28,956
好了，好了，好了!
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

1434
01:18:44,501 --> 01:18:46,600
柯尔特。嘿,男人。
Colt. Hey, man.

1435
01:18:50,439 --> 01:18:54,443
看那个。是啊，在这里拍电影。
Look at that. Yeah, makin' a movie here.

1436
01:18:55,446 --> 01:18:57,248
你能离开我们吗?
Could you leave us, please?

1437
01:18:58,515 --> 01:18:59,855
是的。
Yeah.

1438
01:19:02,156 --> 01:19:04,761
哦,盖尔。所以紧张。
Ooh, Gail. So tense.

1439
01:19:05,929 --> 01:19:07,962
你还记得老德雷斯吧?
You remember old Dressy, right?

1440
01:19:10,096 --> 01:19:11,460
特技演员。
Stuntman.

1441
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:13,935
我从来不会忘记拳头。
I never forget a fist.

1442
01:19:15,169 --> 01:19:17,499
听着，我要用电话。它在哪里?
Listen, I'm gonna need the phone. Where is it?

1443
01:19:17,499 --> 01:19:19,776
这件事很紧急。我需要知道。
It's a matter of urgency. I need to know.

1444
01:19:21,505 --> 01:19:24,913
正确的。证明是你杀了亨利，不是我。
Right. The one that proves that you killed Henry, not me.

1445
01:19:24,913 --> 01:19:26,178
——嗯……-那部手机。
- Eh... - That phone.

1446
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:27,410
——嗯…-是的。
- Well... - Yeah.

1447
01:19:27,410 --> 01:19:29,247
我要拿着它。
I'm gonna hold on to that.

1448
01:19:29,247 --> 01:19:31,282
似乎这是现在唯一能让我活下去的东西。
Seems like it's the only thing keeping me alive right now.

1449
01:19:31,282 --> 01:19:33,317
怎么啦？
What?

1450
01:19:33,317 --> 01:19:35,990
他是头号嫌疑人，乔迪。
He's the prime suspect, Jody.

1451
01:19:35,990 --> 01:19:39,026
盖尔，别这样。你在开玩笑吗?
Gail, come on. Are you kidding me?

1452
01:19:39,026 --> 01:19:40,423
-我知道。——小马吗?
- I know. - Colt?

1453
01:19:40,423 --> 01:19:41,655
-是的。-不可能。
- Yeah. - There's no way.

1454
01:19:41,655 --> 01:19:42,689
-我就是这么说的-不可能!
- That's what I said. - There's no way!

1455
01:19:42,689 --> 01:19:44,097
出了什么问题?
What went wrong?

1456
01:19:44,097 --> 01:19:46,033
-出什么问题了?——嗯。
- What went wrong? - Mmm.

1457
01:19:46,033 --> 01:19:51,940
出了什么问题?在我看来，你就在你的超级游艇外折磨我就像007里的反派一样。
What went wrong? Well, as I look at it, you know, you're-- you're torturing me right outside your superyacht like a Bond villain.

1458
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:52,974
笨蛋!
Dipshit!

1459
01:19:52,974 --> 01:19:54,734
出了什么问题?
What went wrong?

1460
01:19:55,704 --> 01:19:57,847
什么是对的?!
What went right?!

1461
01:19:59,015 --> 01:20:02,610
你改变了。
You changed.

1462
01:20:02,610 --> 01:20:05,283
你改变了。
You changed.

1463
01:20:05,283 --> 01:20:09,958
是的。我们曾经像兄弟一样，你和我。
Yeah. We used to be like brothers, you and I.

1464
01:20:09,958 --> 01:20:13,126
进入了演员和特技演员的神圣纽带，伙计。
Entered into the sacred bond of actor and stuntman, man.

1465
01:20:13,126 --> 01:20:14,897
-天啊。-是的。
- Oh, God. - Yeah.

1466
01:20:14,897 --> 01:20:16,624
你觉得柯尔特会杀人吗?
You think Colt could murder a human being?

1467
01:20:16,624 --> 01:20:18,230
-不，我没有。-你告诉他们了吗?
-No, I don't. - Did you tell them that?

1468
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:24,038
-我说过了。-这是一个男人——这是一个男人花了23分钟把一只蟑螂赶出我的房间，我说，“你就踩它吧，”他说，
- I said that. - This is a man-- This is a man who spent 23 minutes ushering a cockroach out of my room once, and I was like, "Just stomp on it," and he was like,

1469
01:20:24,038 --> 01:20:25,831
“不，让它活下去吧。”我是说，这是柯尔特。
"No, let it live." I mean, it's Colt.

1470
01:20:25,831 --> 01:20:27,470
我把这些都告诉他们了。
I told them all of that.

1471
01:20:27,470 --> 01:20:30,143
我告诉他他是谁，我以为他是谁。
I told him who he is-- who I thought he was.

1472
01:20:30,143 --> 01:20:31,507
你强调过吗?
Did you, emphatically?

1473
01:20:31,507 --> 01:20:35,016
-是的。-对，因为他在你送他去的机场。
- Yes, I did. - Yeah, because he was at the airport where you sent him.

1474
01:20:35,016 --> 01:20:36,842
他没上飞机，乔迪。
He never got on the plane, Jody.

1475
01:20:36,842 --> 01:20:38,415
-我们拍了多少部电影?-我不知道
- How many movies have we done? - Oh, I don't know.

1476
01:20:38,415 --> 01:20:40,153
有多少?对，多得数不清，没错。
How many? Yeah, too many to count, that's right.

1477
01:20:40,153 --> 01:20:42,188
是的。-因为是我让你签合同的，不是吗?
Yeah. -'Cause I put you in the contract, didn't I?

1478
01:20:42,188 --> 01:20:43,684
我把你放在那里，就在那里。
I put you there, right there.

1479
01:20:43,684 --> 01:20:46,720
——嗯。——是吗?没错，我有助理，化妆和发型…-对。
- Mm-hmm. - Yeah? That's right, I had the assistant, the makeup and hair... -Right.

1480
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:50,559
．..训练师，然后是莱德的头号特技演员，柯尔特·西弗斯。
...uh, trainer, and then boom, Ryder's number one stuntman, Colt Seavers.

1481
01:20:50,559 --> 01:20:52,825
那是我，是我干的。我是为了你才这么做的。
That was me, I did that. I did that for you.

1482
01:20:52,825 --> 01:20:55,267
你要为我做什么?嗯?
What are you gonna do for me? Huh?

1483
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:57,599
我猜是死吧?
Die, I guess?

1484
01:20:57,599 --> 01:20:59,205
对吧?死吗?
Right? Die?

1485
01:20:59,205 --> 01:21:00,734
-这是你的计划吗?-这不是针对你。
- Is that the plan? -It's nothing personal.

1486
01:21:00,734 --> 01:21:02,241
我的天啊。好吧，这是针对我个人的。
Oh, my God. Well, I'm taking it personal.

1487
01:21:02,241 --> 01:21:03,605
-是的，我看得出来。-折磨。
- Yeah, I can see that. - The torture.

1488
01:21:03,605 --> 01:21:05,343
你知道吗?这就是生意。
You know what? It's just business.

1489
01:21:05,343 --> 01:21:06,740
-下药，电击枪-你知道，这只是生意。
- The drugging, the Taser. - You know, it's just business.

1490
01:21:06,740 --> 01:21:08,280
汤姆·莱德可是全球知名品牌。
I mean, Tom Ryder's a global brand.

1491
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,051
-我在针对你。-我真的会影响市场。
- I'm taking it personal. - I literally move markets.

1492
01:21:10,051 --> 01:21:13,186
如果我下去……该死的道琼斯指数下跌了。
If I go down... the freakin' Dow goes down.

1493
01:21:13,186 --> 01:21:17,289
如果你摔断了背，我就这样代替你。繁荣。
If you break your back, I replace you like this. Boom.

1494
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:25,363
你知道吗，如果你专心做你的工作而不是抢风头，这事就不会发生了。我是说，亨利不会在现场，他的事故也不会发生，
You know, if you'd just stuck to your job instead of trying to hog the spotlight, this wouldn't have happened. I mean, Henry wouldn't be on the scene, his accident wouldn't have happened,

1495
01:21:25,363 --> 01:21:27,937
你的事故……可怕的小跌落。
your accident... freaky little fall.

1496
01:21:27,937 --> 01:21:29,730
因为你惹毛我了，伙计。
'Cause you just push my buttons, man.

1497
01:21:29,730 --> 01:21:30,896
等一下。怎么啦？
Wait a second. What?

1498
01:21:32,436 --> 01:21:34,867
怎么啦？
What?

1499
01:21:34,867 --> 01:21:37,210
你是怎么说我的意外的?
What did you say about my accident?

1500
01:21:37,210 --> 01:21:39,080
你知道吗，你把我逼疯了。
Well, you know, you pushed me over the edge.

1501
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:43,579
你真的按了一个按钮。我是说，你没有，我是说，我按了按钮。
You literally pushed a button. I mean, you didn't-- I mean, I pushed the button.

1502
01:21:46,991 --> 01:21:49,750
我得把它提高一个档次。
I had to crank it up a notch.

1503
01:21:56,528 --> 01:21:57,967
是你吗?
That was you?

1504
01:21:57,967 --> 01:21:59,595
是的。
Yeah.

1505
01:22:03,007 --> 01:22:05,238
我得给你点教训，不是吗?
Had to teach you a little lesson, didn't I?

1506
01:22:05,238 --> 01:22:08,736
你有点太自大了，是吧?
Got a little too big for your boots, didn't you?

1507
01:22:08,736 --> 01:22:10,177
亨利也不例外，你知道。
Henry's no different, you know.

1508
01:22:11,574 --> 01:22:14,742
嘿。你自己做特技?
Hey. You do your own stunts?

1509
01:22:14,742 --> 01:22:16,348
我要自己表演特技吗?
Do I do my own stunts?

1510
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:18,988
在那么多人面前，这太丢人了。
In front of all those people, that's humiliating.

1511
01:22:18,988 --> 01:22:21,056
是的，我要把你踢进下周。
And yeah, I'm gonna kick you into next week.

1512
01:22:23,324 --> 01:22:28,657
但是盖尔，你知道的……-还记得盖尔吧?-我认识她15年了
But then Gail, you know... - Remember Gail, right? - I've known her for 15 years.

1513
01:22:28,657 --> 01:22:31,957
哦,是的。我忘了，因为你已经离开娱乐圈太久了，你知道吗?-是我介绍你们认识的。
Oh, yeah. I forget, 'cause you've been out of the game - so long, you know? - I introduced the two of you.

1514
01:22:31,957 --> 01:22:33,464
打电话给我说"情况不太好"
Calls me up and says, "It doesn't look good."

1515
01:22:33,464 --> 01:22:44,211
对市场营销和租房不利，还有谋杀和……我知道，我真的，我现在真的不需要这个。
Bad for marketing and renting, and blah, blah, blah, and murder and... I know, I-I-I d-- I real-- I really don't need this right now.

1516
01:22:44,211 --> 01:22:46,180
他妈的亨利!
Fucking Henry!

1517
01:22:46,180 --> 01:22:48,281
别担心。
Don't worry about it.

1518
01:22:48,281 --> 01:22:52,153
你要低调……我来处理一切
You lay low... and I will handle everything.

1519
01:22:53,519 --> 01:22:56,619
也许我们并不像自己认为的那样了解别人。
Maybe we don't know people as well as we think we do.

1520
01:22:56,619 --> 01:22:59,061
-我的天啊。-你知道吗?
- Oh, my God. - You know?

1521
01:23:00,020 --> 01:23:01,129
天啊，是柯尔特。
Oh, my God, it's Colt.

1522
01:23:01,129 --> 01:23:02,559
-把电话给我。——没有。
- Give me the phone. - No.

1523
01:23:02,559 --> 01:23:05,694
-你在干什么?-盖尔，别吃越南粉-哦!你在干什么?-天啊，盖尔!
- What are you doing? - Gail, get off the pho-- - Oh! What are you doing? - Oh, my-- Jesus Christ, Gail!

1524
01:23:05,694 --> 01:23:08,169
-我的天，我很抱歉-我的天啊。
- Oh, my-- Oh, I'm so sorry. - Oh, my God.

1525
01:23:08,169 --> 01:23:09,632
-我来帮你。-不，别说了。
- Let me help you. - No, stop it.

1526
01:23:09,632 --> 01:23:10,864
-让我把它拿上去-你知道吗
- Let me take it up to-- - Do you know what?

1527
01:23:10,864 --> 01:23:11,997
-给我一分钟。——是的。
- Just give me a minute. - Yep.

1528
01:23:11,997 --> 01:23:13,141
给我一分钟。
Just give me a minute.

1529
01:23:13,141 --> 01:23:15,374
——是的。-别这样。
- Yep. - Come on.

1530
01:23:16,344 --> 01:23:18,575
这个计划是如此简单。
This plan was so simple.

1531
01:23:18,575 --> 01:23:22,744
是啊，我们打算把亨利的尸体放在冰上以免腐烂。
Yeah, we were gonna put Henry's body on ice so it doesn't decompose.

1532
01:23:22,744 --> 01:23:25,417
我们可以把你从你爬过的那块石头里救出来。
We could pull you out from that rock you crawled under.

1533
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:27,452
-我的生活，没错。-扫描你的脸。
- My life, yep. - You know, scan your face.

1534
01:23:29,291 --> 01:23:31,390
德雷斯会把你放在谋杀视频里。
Dressy here is gonna stick you on the murder video.

1535
01:23:31,390 --> 01:23:36,021
给你下药，开着你的车，把你和亨利的尸体开下悉尼海港大桥，砰。
Drug you, drive you and Henry's body off the Sydney Harbour Bridge, in your car-- boom.

1536
01:23:36,021 --> 01:23:38,364
你有谋杀，自杀。
You got murder, suicide.

1537
01:23:38,364 --> 01:23:39,827
削减。检查登机口。
Cut. Check the gate.

1538
01:23:39,827 --> 01:23:41,499
继续前进。美丽。
Move on. Beautiful.

1539
01:23:41,499 --> 01:23:43,435
我想我们对什么是简单有不同的理解。
I think we have different ideas of what simple is.

1540
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:45,030
你就是没躺下，对吧?
Y-You just didn't stay down, did you?

1541
01:23:45,030 --> 01:23:48,605
你得像柯尔特·西弗斯那样，制造一场大场面。
You had to, like, uh, create a big scene, like Colt Seavers does.

1542
01:23:48,605 --> 01:23:54,512
你可以，但你知道吗?这还是可行的，因为我们已经有了谋杀证据，现在只需要自杀证据。
You could-- But you know what? This can still work because we got the murder, now we just need the suicide.

1543
01:23:57,515 --> 01:23:59,451
——悲伤。-剧情很重。
- Sad. - It's plot heavy.

1544
01:23:59,451 --> 01:24:01,453
我们在阐述上纠结了。
We're getting tangled in exposition.

1545
01:24:01,453 --> 01:24:03,257
省略最后一部分，自杀。
Lose the last part-- the suicide.

1546
01:24:03,257 --> 01:24:05,226
如果太多，你就会失去观众。
You lose the audience if there's too much.

1547
01:24:05,226 --> 01:24:06,623
柯尔特。
Colt.

1548
01:24:06,623 --> 01:24:07,855
电话在哪里?
Where's the phone?

1549
01:24:07,855 --> 01:24:11,199
汤姆，你需要碳水化合物!
Tom, you need carbs!

1550
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:14,433
你的大脑靠葡萄糖运转!
Your brain runs on glucose!

1551
01:24:14,433 --> 01:24:17,205
对于简单的认知功能。
For simple cognitive functions.

1552
01:24:17,205 --> 01:24:19,636
-你需要他们。-科特，你是替罪羊
- You need them. - Colt, you're the fall guy.

1553
01:24:19,636 --> 01:24:21,803
你是替罪羊，你知道的。
You're the fall guy, you know.

1554
01:24:21,803 --> 01:24:24,443
电话在哪里?
Where's the phone?

1555
01:24:24,443 --> 01:24:28,282
我是说，你可以整晚都受打击，但你知道吗?
I mean, I-- You can keep taking hits all night, but you know what?

1556
01:24:28,282 --> 01:24:30,317
我能想到其他一些人不能。
I can think of a few other people who can't.

1557
01:24:30,317 --> 01:24:33,881
我们可以把丹叫上来，或者乔迪。
We could bring Dan up here, maybe Jody, perhaps.

1558
01:24:33,881 --> 01:24:35,916
我是说，我喜欢乔迪，但是。
I mean, I like Jody, but you know.

1559
01:24:35,916 --> 01:24:38,226
没有电话。
There's no phone.

1560
01:24:38,226 --> 01:24:39,788
好吧?这就是问题所在。
Okay? That's the twist.

1561
01:24:39,788 --> 01:24:41,229
没有电话。
No phone.

1562
01:24:41,229 --> 01:24:44,056
他从我手里把它打飞了。
He shot it out of my hand.

1563
01:24:44,056 --> 01:24:45,629
在上面，去看看。
Up there, go check.

1564
01:24:45,629 --> 01:24:48,170
你也是，你们所有人。我将等待。
You, too, all of you. I'll wait.

1565
01:24:48,170 --> 01:24:50,799
-他开枪了。-你不知道你这么做了吗?
-  He shot it. - You didn't know you did that?

1566
01:24:50,799 --> 01:24:53,439
这太疯狂了。我一直都想告诉你。
It's crazy. I've been wanting to tell you this whole time.

1567
01:24:53,439 --> 01:24:54,770
不，他没有。
No, he didn't.

1568
01:24:54,770 --> 01:24:56,805
-我在门框旁边。——没有。
- I was by the door frame. - No.

1569
01:24:56,805 --> 01:24:58,972
他把它从我手里射走了!
And he shoots it out of my hands!

1570
01:24:58,972 --> 01:25:00,512
——没有。-把领带摘了。
- No. - Take the ties off.

1571
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:02,415
-天啊，真是松了口气。-太疯狂了。
- Oh, my God, what a relief. - That's crazy.

1572
01:25:02,415 --> 01:25:07,915
有一件事你说对了，那是唯一让你活下来的东西。
You were right about one thing, that was the only thing keeping you alive.

1573
01:25:07,915 --> 01:25:11,083
我真希望你能看到乔迪要和金属风暴做什么。
I really wish you could see what Jody's gonna do with Metalstorm.

1574
01:25:11,083 --> 01:25:12,590
一定会很棒的。
It's gonna be awesome.

1575
01:25:12,590 --> 01:25:16,297
老实说……会很热闹的。
And honestly... it's gonna be a banger.

1576
01:25:17,564 --> 01:25:19,531
现在没那么自大了吧，伙计?
Not so cocky now, are you, mate?

1577
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:21,962
天啊，迈克迈克，闭嘴吧。
Jesus, Mike Mike, put a lid on it.

1578
01:25:26,408 --> 01:25:28,474
真希望你没破坏我们的关系，兄弟。
Wish you didn't break that bond, bro.

1579
01:25:28,474 --> 01:25:30,036
希望你没有打破这种联系。
Wish you didn't break that bond.

1580
01:25:30,036 --> 01:25:32,445
好了，特技演员，该喝一杯了，伙计。是吗?
All right, stuntman, time for a drink, mate. Eh?

1581
01:25:32,445 --> 01:25:35,481
-好了。是吗?
- There we go. Eh?

1582
01:25:35,481 --> 01:25:37,142
的帮助!
Help!

1583
01:25:37,142 --> 01:25:38,979
——帮助!
- Help!

1584
01:25:38,979 --> 01:25:40,717
-闭嘴。闭嘴。——帮助!
- Shut up. Shut up. - Help!

1585
01:25:40,717 --> 01:25:42,719
闭嘴，伙计。
Shut up, mate.

1586
01:25:51,235 --> 01:25:52,696
在那里。
There.

1587
01:25:52,696 --> 01:25:54,236
这个恶作剧是真的。
This fire gag's real.

1588
01:26:08,945 --> 01:26:10,483
快点，伙计们，开船。
Come on, guys, start the boat.

1589
01:26:10,483 --> 01:26:11,849
他走错路了。
He's gone the wrong way.

1590
01:26:24,301 --> 01:26:25,729
狗屎!
Shit!

1591
01:27:37,130 --> 01:27:38,967
哦,小马。
Oh, Colt.

1592
01:27:38,967 --> 01:27:40,067
小马吗?
Colt?

1593
01:27:40,067 --> 01:27:41,442
-嗨。-怎么回事?
- Hey. - What's going on?

1594
01:27:41,442 --> 01:27:42,476
你唱了什么?
What'd you sing?

1595
01:27:42,476 --> 01:27:44,346
——什么?-在卡拉ok。
- What? - At karaoke.

1596
01:27:44,346 --> 01:27:45,743
-很抱歉我没来。-没关系。
- I'm sorry I didn't make it. - It doesn't matter.

1597
01:27:45,743 --> 01:27:47,316
听。大家都说你杀了亨利。
Listen. Everyone's saying you killed Henry.

1598
01:27:47,316 --> 01:27:48,977
-怎么了?-不是这样的
- What's happening? - Oh, that's not true.

1599
01:27:48,977 --> 01:27:50,517
你会听到很多不真实的事情。
You're gonna hear a lot of things that aren't true.

1600
01:27:50,517 --> 01:27:56,985
我只想说，我刚来的时候，当你问我怎么样，我对你竖起大拇指的时候，当你说"那是特技演员的屁话"的时候
I just wanted to say that when I first got here, when you asked how I was doing and I gave you the thumbs-up, when you were like, "That's stunt guy bullshit,"

1601
01:27:56,985 --> 01:28:02,793
你说得对，这完全是陈词滥调，但是，你知道，你看不到拇指向下的特技演员是有原因的。
and you're right, it's total cliché, but, you know, there's a reason you don't see the thumbs-down stunt guy.

1602
01:28:04,698 --> 01:28:07,435
这是我们训练的一部分。
You know, it's kind of part of our training.

1603
01:28:07,435 --> 01:28:13,375
对吧?你被车撞了，你被扔出窗外，你被点着了，你竖起大拇指。
Right? You know, you get hit by a car, you get thrown out of a window, you get set on fire, you give the thumbs-up.

1604
01:28:13,375 --> 01:28:24,518
但是，在我出了意外之后——顺便说一下，我发现那不是意外——我…我不太好。
But, uh, after my accident-- turns out was not an accident, by the way-- I, uh... I wasn't okay.

1605
01:28:25,521 --> 01:28:33,257
不是因为我摔断了背，而是因为我觉得自己像个巨大的…失败。
And not because I broke my back, because I just felt like a huge... failure.

1606
01:28:36,323 --> 01:28:40,831
然后我意识到…你知道，我不是不可战胜的。
And I realized that, uh... you know, I'm not invincible.

1607
01:28:40,831 --> 01:28:42,536
巨大的震动。
Huge shocker.

1608
01:28:43,737 --> 01:28:53,745
我想也许我不是那么特别，所以我…只是觉得你对我的鄙视不是你想要的，所以我就消失了。
And I thought maybe I wasn't so special or something, so I, uh... just figured that the thumbs-down version of me wasn't what you got into it for, so I disappeared.

1609
01:28:53,745 --> 01:28:56,242
但是，你知道，我不是凭空消失的。
But, you know, I didn't just disappear on you.

1610
01:28:56,242 --> 01:29:04,052
嗯…我就这样消失了…了。
Uh... just disappeared on, on, uh, myself... too.

1611
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:07,594
不管怎样，我很抱歉。
Anyway, I'm sorry.

1612
01:29:07,594 --> 01:29:09,596
你应该得到更多。我很抱歉。
You deserved more than that. I'm sorry.

1613
01:29:09,596 --> 01:29:11,862
我只是想让你说实话。
I just wanted you to be honest.

1614
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:16,295
你知道吗，说实话，这很伤人。
You know, honestly, it, uh, all hurts.

1615
01:29:21,709 --> 01:29:24,072
被车撞了会疼。
Getting hit by a car hurts.

1616
01:29:24,072 --> 01:29:26,074
被扔出窗外很疼。
Getting thrown out of a window hurts.

1617
01:29:26,074 --> 01:29:30,210
着火真的很疼。
Getting set on fire really hurts.

1618
01:29:30,210 --> 01:29:33,422
但是,呃…
But, uh...

1619
01:29:36,658 --> 01:29:38,988
．..没有什么比不能和你在一起更痛苦的了。
...none of it ever hurt as much as not being with you.

1620
01:29:41,564 --> 01:29:43,256
你在哪里?
Where are you?

1621
01:29:44,732 --> 01:29:47,865
这是电影里的台词还是我瞎编的?
Is that from a movie or did I just make that up?

1622
01:29:47,865 --> 01:29:49,570
非常好。
It's pretty good.

1623
01:29:49,570 --> 01:29:51,066
-他来了!-如果你想的话可以用。
-There he is! - You can use it if you want.

1624
01:29:54,610 --> 01:29:58,172
不,请…不管怎样，我还爱着你。
No, please... For what it's worth, I'm still in love with you.

1625
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:01,978
我觉得你不应该放弃那个幸福的结局。
And I don't think you should give up on that happy ending.

1626
01:30:01,978 --> 01:30:03,177
柯尔特。

1627

-我就知道。
- I knew it.

1678
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:01,915
我知道你还活着。
I knew you were alive.

每天三场，每周六天，持续三年。

你记得。
You remembered.

1682
01:35:08,790 --> 01:35:11,584
是的。我很高兴你还活着，科特。
Yes. I'm happy you're alive, Colt.

1683
01:35:11,584 --> 01:35:13,520
科特，我很高兴你还活着。
Colt, I'm so happy you're alive.

1684
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:15,060
-我就知道。-我的天啊。
- I knew it. - Oh, my God.

1685
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:16,897
-你在干什么…-笔写得不错。
- What were you doing... - Nice work with the pen.

1686
01:35:16,897 --> 01:35:18,261
抱歉。-不，很棒。你说得很及时。
So sorry. -No, it was great. You got it out just in time.

1687
01:35:18,261 --> 01:35:19,933
我觉得墨水中毒还没发生。
I think the ink poisoning didn't set in.

1688
01:35:19,933 --> 01:35:22,397
-大厨之吻。-怎么回事?
-  Chef's kiss. - What's going on?

1689
01:35:22,397 --> 01:35:24,267
嗯?-大家都说你杀了亨利。
Huh? -Everyone's saying that you killed Henry.

1690
01:35:24,267 --> 01:35:26,434
赖德杀了亨利。他陷害了我。
Ryder killed Henry. He framed me.

1691
01:35:26,434 --> 01:35:27,732
这是你的录像。
There's footage of you.

1692
01:35:27,732 --> 01:35:29,635
-嗯，他欺骗了我。——什么?
- Well, he deepfaked me. - What?

1693
01:35:29,635 --> 01:35:31,703
他们总是在网上这么做。
They do it all the time on the Internet.

1694
01:35:31,703 --> 01:35:34,310
他们把汤姆·克鲁斯的脸，放在你的脸上。
They take Tom Cruise's face, and they put it on yours.

1695
01:35:34,310 --> 01:35:35,740
你看不出其中的区别。
And you can't tell the difference.

1696
01:35:35,740 --> 01:35:39,117
不。好吧，莱德杀亨利的真实录像在哪里?我们怎么得到它?
No. Okay, so where's the real footage of Ryder killing Henry? How do we get it?

1697
01:35:39,117 --> 01:35:43,220
本来在莱德的手机里，后来被毁了因为丹的最后一个莫希干人计划失败了。-什么?
It was on Ryder's phone, and then it got destroyed because Dan's Last of the Mohicans plan didn't work out. -What?

1698
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:46,091
这不是他的错，知道吗?他先给战斧打了电话。
It's not his fault, you know? He called tomahawk first, okay.

1699
01:35:46,091 --> 01:35:47,455
我得到的是"只限空包弹"
I got "blanks only."

1700
01:35:47,455 --> 01:35:50,557
其实一切都进行得很顺利，然后德雷斯勒出现了。
And it was going pretty well, actually, and then Dressler showed up.

1701
01:35:50,557 --> 01:35:53,395
所以他，你知道，他就像杰森·伯恩一样。
So he, you know, he does this, like, Jason Bourne shit.

1702
01:35:53,395 --> 01:35:55,969
好吧，我有很多问题。
Okay, I have so many questions.

1703
01:35:55,969 --> 01:35:57,465
好吧。
Okay.

1704
01:35:57,465 --> 01:35:59,467
还有谁知道你还活着?
Who else knows you're alive?

1705
01:35:59,467 --> 01:36:01,238
-没人。——太棒了。
- No one. - Great.

1706
01:36:01,238 --> 01:36:04,109
不，这才是重点。我是说，我想除非他们认为我死了，否则我们没法看完这部电影。
No, that's the point. I mean, I figure we can't finish the movie unless they think I'm dead.

1707
01:36:04,109 --> 01:36:05,770
什么电影?
What movie?

1708
01:36:05,770 --> 01:36:06,815
Metalstorm。
Metalstorm.

1709
01:36:06,815 --> 01:36:08,575
金属风暴呢?
What about Metalstorm?

1710
01:36:08,575 --> 01:36:09,983
如果他们认为我死了，他们就会回来把我干掉。
If they think I'm dead, they'll come back and finish.

1711
01:36:09,983 --> 01:36:11,149
——谁?-赖德。
- Who? - Ryder.

1712
01:36:11,149 --> 01:36:12,854
-结束什么?-电影。
- Finish what? - The movie.

1713
01:36:12,854 --> 01:36:14,185
——Metalstorm ?——没错。
- Metalstorm? - Exactly.

1714
01:36:14,185 --> 01:36:16,022
-你疯了吗?你疯了。——什么?
- Are you insane? You are insane. - What?

1715
01:36:16,022 --> 01:36:20,356
你需要烧掉你的指纹，你需要尽快越过边境。
You need to be burning your fingerprints off, and you need to be getting across the border as fast as possible.

1716
01:36:20,356 --> 01:36:22,688
我们要把你藏起来，直到我们能证明你的清白。
We're gonna hide you until we can clear your name.

1717
01:36:22,688 --> 01:36:24,624
这些都不重要了。这只是一部愚蠢的电影。
None of it matters anymore. It's just a stupid movie.

1718
01:36:24,624 --> 01:36:25,691
——什么?-这是部愚蠢的电影。
- What? - It's a stupid movie.

1719
01:36:25,691 --> 01:36:27,165
别这么说。
Don't say that.

1720
01:36:27,165 --> 01:36:29,761
你说的可是金属风暴啊。
That's Metalstorm you're talking about.

1721
01:36:29,761 --> 01:36:32,038
那是你一生都想拍的电影。
That's the movie you spent your whole life trying to make.

1722
01:36:32,038 --> 01:36:33,699
谁知道呢?
Who knows?

1723
01:36:33,699 --> 01:36:39,012
你可能会激励整整一代小乔迪拿起相机，拍他们自己的电影。
You might inspire a whole generation of little Jodys to pick up cameras and make their own movies.

1724
01:36:41,016 --> 01:36:43,016
你只是，你很特别。
You're just-- you're special.

1725
01:36:44,184 --> 01:36:48,648
我们所有人都能成为特殊事物的一部分，因为它来自于你。
And all of us get to be a part of something special because it comes from you.

1726
01:36:48,648 --> 01:36:55,864
很明显我没能给我们带来幸福的结局，但如果我让太空牛仔和阿莲娜没有他们的结局，那我就完蛋了。
I obviously failed at getting us our happy ending, but I'll be damned if I'm gonna let Space Cowboy and Aliena not have theirs.

1727
01:37:02,167 --> 01:37:03,531
乔迪，亲爱的!
Jody, my love!

1728
01:37:03,531 --> 01:37:06,204
-等一下!-我来了…-别说了。
- One sec! - I'm coming... - Stop it.

1729
01:37:06,204 --> 01:37:07,733
盖尔。她也有份。
Gail. She's in on it.

1730
01:37:07,733 --> 01:37:09,405
——什么?——是的。
- What? - Yes.

1731
01:37:09,405 --> 01:37:11,209
好吧，来吧。-我们先亲一下吧。
Okay, come on. -Let's just kiss a little bit first.

1732
01:37:11,209 --> 01:37:13,013
不，拜托，我们得带你去洗手间。
No, come on, we g-- got to get you in the bathroom, please.

1733
01:37:14,544 --> 01:37:15,774
来吧。
Come on.

1734
01:37:17,382 --> 01:37:19,151
来吧。
Come on.

1735
01:37:19,151 --> 01:37:21,648
——基督!
- Christ!

1736
01:37:21,648 --> 01:37:22,990
得工作了。
Got to work.

1737
01:37:22,990 --> 01:37:24,926
你还好吧，亲爱的?
You all right in there, my darling?

1738
01:37:24,926 --> 01:37:27,390
拿这个，拿这个肥皂在我肚子上擦。
Here, this-- Take this soap and rub it on my belly.

1739
01:37:29,262 --> 01:37:30,899
到卧室里去。
Get in the bedroom.

1740
01:37:30,899 --> 01:37:33,396
——好的。柯尔特。你还好吗?好吧。——好的。是的。
- Okay. Colt. Are you good? Okay. - Okay. Yeah.

1741
01:37:33,396 --> 01:37:35,728
-安静点。别出声。工作吗?
- Be quiet. Don't make a sound. -Jod?

1742
01:37:35,728 --> 01:37:37,037
-我的头。头部。——什么?
- My head. The head. - What?

1743
01:37:39,534 --> 01:37:41,272
——你好!-嘿。你好,你。
- Hi! -Hey. Hello, you.

1744
01:37:41,272 --> 01:37:43,505
-嗨。嘿。-噢，过来。
- Hey. Hey. - Aw, come here.

1745
01:37:43,505 --> 01:37:44,913
谢谢你！
Thank you.

1746
01:37:44,913 --> 01:37:46,343
我最喜欢的导演怎么样了?
Aw, how's my favorite director?

1747
01:37:46,343 --> 01:37:47,740
有点情绪化，你知道的。
Uh, a bit emotional, you know.

1748
01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:49,247
哦，不——天哪。
Oh, no-- Jesus.

1749
01:37:49,247 --> 01:37:50,875
就像约翰尼和安珀刚刚来过一样。
Like Johnny and Amber have just been here.

1750
01:37:50,875 --> 01:37:55,517
我只是想发泄一下，因为…-我经历了太多。-我知道。我知道。
I just need to vent, 'cause it's been... - it's just been so much. - I know. I know.

1751
01:37:55,517 --> 01:37:57,123
-柯尔特的事我很抱歉。-谢谢。
- I'm so sorry about Colt. - Thank you.

1752
01:37:57,123 --> 01:37:59,587
你知道，这太遗憾了，但真是一团糟。
You know, it's such a shame, but what a mess.

1753
01:37:59,587 --> 01:38:00,962
——正确的。-谁知道呢?
- Right. - Who knew?

1754
01:38:00,962 --> 01:38:02,854
-是的。-我是说，我试过帮他
- Yeah. - I mean, I tried to help him.

1755
01:38:02,854 --> 01:38:06,759
我希望你知道这一点，但有时候你帮不了那些不想被拯救的人。——正确的。
I hope you know that, but sometimes you can't help people - who don't want to be saved. - Right.

1756
01:38:06,759 --> 01:38:12,237
但在这片乌云中有一线希望。
But silver lining to this very dark cloud.

1757
01:38:12,237 --> 01:38:14,074
我让莱德回来了。
I've got Ryder to come back.

1758
01:38:14,074 --> 01:38:15,702
-我有个计划。——真的吗?
- And I have a plan. - Really?

1759
01:38:15,702 --> 01:38:20,575
但我们没法表演你第三幕的大戏了，跳车。
But we're not gonna be able to do your big third act set piece, the car jump.

1760
01:38:20,575 --> 01:38:23,710
这是不可能的跳跃，尤其是现在柯尔特走了。
It is an impossible jump, especially now with Colt gone.

1761
01:38:23,710 --> 01:38:25,778
——死了。-他走了。
- Dead. - He's gone.

1762
01:38:25,778 --> 01:38:27,989
-他死定了-别走开。
- He's so dead. - Stay with me.

1763
01:38:27,989 --> 01:38:29,485
我和温蒂谈过了。
I spoke to Venti.

1764
01:38:29,485 --> 01:38:31,421
她说她可以用视觉特效来做。
She says that she can do it in VFX.

1765
01:38:31,421 --> 01:38:32,818
汽车跳了起来。
The car jump.

1766
01:38:32,818 --> 01:38:38,593
我们只需要关注莱德最新的，最后的，夸夸其谈的独白。
All we need to focus on is Ryder's new, final, bombastic monologue.

1767
01:38:38,593 --> 01:38:39,968
我读过了。
I've read the pages.

1768
01:38:39,968 --> 01:38:41,464
天啊，你把它砸了。我知道你会的。
God, you smashed it. I knew you would.

1769
01:38:41,464 --> 01:38:43,004
-我们会掩护他的-是的。
- We're gonna get him covered. - Yeah.

1770
01:38:43,004 --> 01:38:48,273
你,与此同时…请到斐济去休息吧，我请客。
You, meanwhile... please go and rest up in Fiji, on me.

1771
01:38:48,273 --> 01:38:51,507
你知道吗?扑通一声躺在沙滩上。
You know? Plop yourself on a beach.

1772
01:38:51,507 --> 01:38:53,938
我会帮你处理好这一切的。
And I'm gonna take care of all of it for you.

1773
01:38:53,938 --> 01:38:54,983
盖尔。
Gail.

1774
01:38:54,983 --> 01:38:56,512
你有太多事情要处理。
You've got so much to process.

1775
01:38:56,512 --> 01:38:58,250
——没有。-我能搞定一切。
- No. - I can take care of all of it.

1776
01:38:58,250 --> 01:39:00,780
不。这是我的电影。
No. This is my movie.

1777
01:39:00,780 --> 01:39:02,452
-听我说。
- Now, listen to me.

1778
01:39:02,452 --> 01:39:03,948
我从你身上学到了很多。
I've learned so much from you.

1779
01:39:03,948 --> 01:39:06,621
-我知道。谢谢你！-我很感激。
- I know. Thank you. - And I'm very grateful.

1780
01:39:06,621 --> 01:39:10,328
但我现在学到的教训，你教给我的……-是的。是的。
But the lesson I stand by now, - that you've taught me... - Yeah. Yeah.

1781
01:39:10,328 --> 01:39:13,958
你跌倒了，马上爬起来。
You fall down, you get right back up.

1782
01:39:16,961 --> 01:39:18,963
是的，我在导演这部电影。
I am directing this movie, yeah.

1783
01:39:18,963 --> 01:39:20,470
天啊，那是我的女朋友。
Oh, my God, that's my girl.

1784
01:39:20,470 --> 01:39:22,373
它进了。我真为你骄傲。改善情况。好吧。
It went in. I'm so proud of you. -Good. Okay.

1785
01:39:22,373 --> 01:39:23,935
谢谢你！好了，我带你离开这里。
Thank you. All right, let's get you out of here.

1786
01:39:23,935 --> 01:39:25,772
-最后一件事。——是吗?
- One last thing. - Yeah?

1787
01:39:25,772 --> 01:39:27,444
你看到丹了吗?不。我想他在墨西哥卷饼车旁边。
Have you seen Dan? -Nope. I think he's by the taco truck.

1788
01:39:27,444 --> 01:39:30,150
-你没有他的消息吗?-他可能就在那边的某个地方。非常感谢。
- You haven't heard from him? - He's probably-probably over there somewhere. Thank you so much.

1789
01:39:30,150 --> 01:39:31,712
-我为你骄傲。-谢谢。
- I'm proud of you. - Thank you.

1790
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:34,286
谢谢你的鼓励。好的,buh-bye。我爱你，亲爱的。-我也爱你。再见!
Thanks for the pep talk. Okay, buh-bye. - - Love you, darling. - Love you, too. Bye!

1791
01:39:34,286 --> 01:39:36,189
现钞。
Oof.

1792
01:39:36,189 --> 01:39:37,718
你要把电影看完。
You're gonna finish the movie.

1793
01:39:37,718 --> 01:39:40,358
不，我要为你正名。好了，现在听着。
No, I'm gonna clear your name. Okay, now listen.

1794
01:39:40,358 --> 01:39:41,557
为什么我们不能两者兼顾呢?
Why can't we do both?

1795
01:39:41,557 --> 01:39:42,657
我想我们可以。
I think we can.

1796
01:39:42,657 --> 01:39:49,961
我们要把他带到片场，在一个可控的环境里，然后包围他……我们把他打得屁滚尿流。
We're gonna bring him to set, in a controlled environment, and then we surround him... And we beat the shit out of him.

1797
01:39:49,961 --> 01:39:51,468
不。
No.

1798
01:39:51,468 --> 01:39:55,307
我们要把他放到一个场景里逼他招供。
We're gonna force a confession out of him by putting him in a scene.

1799
01:39:55,307 --> 01:39:56,902
正确的。-你知道，他总是忘记带着麦克风。
Right. -You know, he always forgets he's mic'd.

1800
01:39:56,902 --> 01:39:58,376
这是更好的。
That's better.

1801
01:39:58,376 --> 01:39:59,839
我只是还不知道该怎么做。
I just don't know how to do it yet.

1802
01:40:03,581 --> 01:40:05,086
我知道怎么做。
I know how to do that.

1803
01:40:07,288 --> 01:40:09,486
让他自己表演特技。
Make him do his own stunt.

1804
01:40:09,486 --> 01:40:11,092
不可能的跳跃。
The impossible jump.

1805
01:40:11,092 --> 01:40:13,523
然后我们把他打得屁滚尿流。
Then we beat the shit out of him.

1806
01:40:13,523 --> 01:40:16,798
1 - 74，第2次。
One seventy-four, alpha, take two.

1807
01:40:19,861 --> 01:40:21,168
杨晨:开始!
JODY And action!

1808
01:40:21,168 --> 01:40:23,269
等一下，等一下，等一下。
O-One second, one second, one second.

1809
01:40:26,032 --> 01:40:27,702
——行动!
- Action!

1810
01:40:29,671 --> 01:40:32,905
伙计们，现在是宇宙边缘的正午。
It's high noon at the edge of the universe, folks.

1811
01:40:48,890 --> 01:40:51,891
现在，我们面对的是一个强大的敌人。
Now, we're facing a powerful enemy.

1812
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:58,062
一个具有人类最坏特征的外星物种。
An alien species born of the worst of humanity's traits.

1813
01:40:58,062 --> 01:41:04,904
我们的敌人没有看到的是他们的死亡迫在眉睫。
Well, what our enemy doesn't see is that their demise is imminent.

1814
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:10,846
银河系中最强大的武器是什么?
And the most powerful weapon in all galaxy?

1815
01:41:13,915 --> 01:41:15,849
爱。
Love.

1816
01:41:17,358 --> 01:41:23,956
你们每个人内心都有火花，宝贝。
Inside each and every one of you is a spark, baby.

1817
01:41:23,956 --> 01:41:25,727
一个灰烬。
An ember.

1818
01:41:25,727 --> 01:41:28,092
该死的火!
A goddamn fire!

1819
01:41:31,966 --> 01:41:35,066
爱是我们取胜的方式。
Love is how we will win.

1820
01:41:35,066 --> 01:41:41,281
即使我们输了，我们也会为了一个幸福的结局而死!
And even if we lose, we're gonna die fighting for a happy ending!

1821
01:41:41,281 --> 01:41:44,515
-当然!
- Hell yeah!

1822
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:46,110
哇!
Whoo!

1823
01:41:46,110 --> 01:41:48,112
好吧，那我们去拿吧!
Well, let's go and get it, then!

1824
01:41:48,112 --> 01:41:51,082
快走吧!
Get on out there and go!

1825
01:41:51,082 --> 01:41:53,986
谁跟我一起?!谁和我在一起?!我们走吧!
Who's with me?! Who is with me?! Let's go!

1826
01:41:53,986 --> 01:41:55,955
减少!是的!
Cut! Yes!

1827
01:41:55,955 --> 01:41:57,990
太好了，太好了。
So good, so good.

1828
01:41:57,990 --> 01:41:59,332
-谢谢。-就这样吗?
- Thank you. -  Was that it?

1829
01:41:59,332 --> 01:42:00,465
-天啊，是的。-我们拿到了吗?
- God, yeah. - Did we get it?

1830
01:42:00,465 --> 01:42:02,126
-太棒了。-明白了吗?
- It was so good. - We got it?

1831
01:42:02,126 --> 01:42:03,534
——魔法。是的,是的。-是的，很热，宝贝。
- Magic. Yeah, yeah. -Yeah, it was hot, babe.

1832
01:42:03,534 --> 01:42:05,206
我的天啊。盖尔被洪水淹没了。
Oh, my God. Gail was in floods.

1833
01:42:05,206 --> 01:42:06,867
我真的感觉到了。我真的感觉到了。
I really felt that one. I really felt that one.

1834
01:42:06,867 --> 01:42:08,473
-她是你当然是-因为我流泪了。
- She was-- Of course you did. - 'Cause I had tears.

1835
01:42:08,473 --> 01:42:10,035
当然了。是的，我知道。我能看到他们。
Of course you did. Yeah, I know. I can see them.

1836
01:42:10,035 --> 01:42:11,773
——是的，非常棒。
-- Yeah, it was fantastic.

1837
01:42:11,773 --> 01:42:14,006
听着，我们只剩下外星卡车的报道了。
So, listen, all we have left is the alien truck coverage.

1838
01:42:14,006 --> 01:42:15,447
-好吗?就是这样。——没有。
- All right? That's it. - No.

1839
01:42:15,447 --> 01:42:17,141
是的。我们要跳车了。-不。
Yep. We're gonna do the car jump. -No.

1840
01:42:17,141 --> 01:42:18,879
没人告诉我还有圈套。-我们说——不。
No one told me about another setup. -We said-- No.

1841
01:42:18,879 --> 01:42:22,487
-还有别的圈套吗?- Venti会在视觉特效里做这个，所以我们走吧。-我知道，但我们需要他的特写。
- There's another setup? - Venti's gonna do that in VFX, so we're out of here. -I know, but we need his close-up.

1842
01:42:22,487 --> 01:42:24,049
好吧?我需要他的特写，就在这里。
All right? I need his close-up right here for the coverage.

1843
01:42:24,049 --> 01:42:25,193
好吧?最多15分钟。这就是我所需要的。
All right? 15 minutes tops. That's all I need.

1844
01:42:25,193 --> 01:42:28,460
你还记得吗，这是太空牛仔偷外星人飞船的片段?嗯。
This is the bit, do you remember, where Space Cowboy steals the alien vehicle? -Hmm.

1845
01:42:28,460 --> 01:42:29,857
-别这样。这是他的时刻。-等等，等等，等等。
- Come on. This is his moment. - Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1846
01:42:29,857 --> 01:42:31,199
我不会开车的，对吧?
I'm not gonna do any driving, right?

1847
01:42:31,199 --> 01:42:32,794
因为我会觉得很恶心。
Because I'm gonna feel really nauseous.

1848
01:42:32,794 --> 01:42:34,059
这是一个蓝屏设置。
It's a blue screen setup.

1849
01:42:34,059 --> 01:42:36,204
我需要这个。我需要这个，好吗?
I need this. I need this, okay?

1850
01:42:37,196 --> 01:42:38,635
这里没有通知。
Zero notice here.

1851
01:42:38,635 --> 01:42:40,670
我们已经尽可能快了，好吗?
We're moving as fast as we can, all right?

1852
01:42:40,670 --> 01:42:43,574
大家加快速度，好吗?!
Everyone, double the pace, yes?!

1853
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:45,873
运用你的肌肉!是的,很好!谢谢你！
Use those muscles! Yes, good! Thank you!

1854
01:42:50,583 --> 01:42:53,177
所有人就位!
Everyone in position!

1855
01:42:53,177 --> 01:42:55,047
把火点起来!
Light the pyro!

1856
01:42:56,292 --> 01:43:00,657
我们需要足够的炸药把峡谷炸上天。
We need enough charges to blow this canyon sky-high, people.

1857
01:43:00,657 --> 01:43:02,362
奈杰尔·麦凯布，我们在哪儿?
NIGEL McCabe, where are we?

1858
01:43:02,362 --> 01:43:03,693
我已经尽可能快了，奈吉。
Going as fast as I can, Nige.

1859
01:43:03,693 --> 01:43:05,024
我们已经准备好了。
We're as ready as we can be.

1860
01:43:05,024 --> 01:43:08,500
好吧。嘿，让雷在我们走之前进来检查一下麦克风，好吗?复制。
Okay. Hey, get Ray to come in and check the mic before we go, okay? -Copy.

1861
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:11,272
声音，你能下来看看莱德的麦克风吗?
Sound, can you come down here and check Ryder's mic, please?

1862
01:43:16,378 --> 01:43:17,938
好吧，汤姆。你准备好了吗?
All right, Tom. You ready?

1863
01:43:17,938 --> 01:43:19,610
-是的。——好的。还记得这一点吗?
- Yeah. - Okay. Remember this bit?

1864
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:20,842
你会坐在外星人的车里。-嗯。
You're gonna be in the alien vehicle. -Mm-hmm.

1865
01:43:20,842 --> 01:43:21,909
——好吗?好吧。——是的。
- Okay? Okay. - Yep.

1866
01:43:21,909 --> 01:43:24,582
没有地方可去，你要把车跳下去。
And with nowhere to go, you're gonna jump the car over the ravine.

1867
01:43:24,582 --> 01:43:28,047
所以我需要给你做个快速检查…太空牛仔不怕峡谷。
So I just need a quick pop on you... Space Cowboy ain't scared of no ravine.

1868
01:43:28,047 --> 01:43:31,215
-他当然不是-所以我想也许就拍几张我咬牙切齿的反应照。-是的。
- Of course he's not. - So I'm thinking maybe just a couple of reaction shots of me gritting my teeth. -Yeah.

1869
01:43:31,215 --> 01:43:32,084
“该死的。”差不多就是这样。
Like, "Goddamn." Something like that.

1870
01:43:32,084 --> 01:43:33,459
对，对，对。斯多葛派。
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Stoic.

1871
01:43:33,459 --> 01:43:34,790
-是的，是的。我喜欢它。-好吗?
- Yeah, yeah. I like it. - All right?

1872
01:43:34,790 --> 01:43:36,462
-你觉得呢?-我喜欢。好吧。
- What do you think? - I like it. Okay.

1873
01:43:36,462 --> 01:43:37,562
我觉得会很棒的。是的，我喜欢这个选择。
I think it's gonna be great. Yeah, I love the choice.

1874
01:43:37,562 --> 01:43:38,860
好了，戴上这个吧。
All right, let's pop these on.

1875
01:43:38,860 --> 01:43:40,466
——好的。这是什么?-给你。
- Okay. What's this? - There you go.

1876
01:43:40,466 --> 01:43:41,863
不，这是因为你从外星人那里逃出来了。
No, this is because you've escaped the aliens.

1877
01:43:41,863 --> 01:43:43,194
这有必要吗?有点多，不是吗?
Is this necessary? It's a bit much, no?

1878
01:43:43,194 --> 01:43:44,030
是的。看起来很酷。提高赌注。
Yeah. It looks cool. Raise the stakes.

1879
01:43:44,030 --> 01:43:45,768
这挺酷的。
It's kind of cool.

1880
01:43:45,768 --> 01:43:47,374
-是的。天气凉爽。好吧。-提高赌注。
- Yeah. It's cool. Okay. - Raise the stakes.

1881
01:43:47,374 --> 01:43:48,573
-我们开始吧。-因为你知道，太空牛仔。
- Let's do it. - 'Cause you know, Space Cowboy.

1882
01:43:48,573 --> 01:43:50,377
没人能接近太空牛仔。
Nobody can get at the Space Cowboy.

1883
01:43:50,377 --> 01:43:52,071
-不可能。即使他被铐上手铐。-打扰一下。汤姆,不好意思。
- No way. Even when he's cuffed. - Excuse me. Tom, sorry.

1884
01:43:52,071 --> 01:43:53,710
耶稣,雷。我上片场之前就告诉过你了。
Jesus, Ray. I told you to do it before I got on set.

1885
01:43:53,710 --> 01:43:55,415
-谢谢你，汤姆。
- Appreciate you, Tom.

1886
01:43:55,415 --> 01:43:56,416
谢谢你！听起来不错。
Thank you. Sound good.

1887
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:57,648
——好的。-好的，太好了。
- Okay. - Okay, great.

1888
01:43:57,648 --> 01:44:00,420
——所以……——所以……有个家伙从你左边过来。是的。
- So... - So... You got this guy coming on your left. -Yep.

1889
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:01,982
-嘿，兄弟。-好吧，干掉他。
- Hey, bro. - All right, take him out.

1890
01:44:01,982 --> 01:44:02,983
有人会撞到引擎盖的。
Someone else is gonna crash down on the bonnet.

1891
01:44:02,983 --> 01:44:04,655
你要把他干掉。
You're gonna take him out.

1892
01:44:04,655 --> 01:44:08,989
不，不，不。你看，我在想的是也许我下来，先把他干掉，然后我就"噗，噗，噗"
No, no, no. See, what I'm thinking is maybe I come down, I take him out first, and I'm like "pow, pow, pow."

1893
01:44:08,989 --> 01:44:11,057
-我滑过去“噗”的一声-是的。是的。
- I slide over and go "pow." - Yeah. Yeah.

1894
01:44:11,057 --> 01:44:15,996
然后我可能会说一句，“在我被雇佣之前，我就在拍摄外星人。”
And then maybe I say a little line like, "I was shooting aliens way before I was paid to."

1895
01:44:15,996 --> 01:44:18,064
太棒了。好吧，我们把它锁起来。
Fantastic. All right, let's lock it up.

1896
01:44:18,064 --> 01:44:20,066
-我们开枪吧，奈杰尔。-请待命。
- Let's shoot, Nigel. -Standing by, please.

1897
01:44:20,066 --> 01:44:21,166
好吧。
All right.

1898
01:44:21,166 --> 01:44:22,574
拿一个。标记。
Take one. Marker.

1899
01:44:22,574 --> 01:44:25,973
三，二，一，开始。
In three, two, one, action.

1900
01:44:27,271 --> 01:44:28,844
你今天不走运，外星人。
Not your lucky day, alien.

1901
01:44:28,844 --> 01:44:30,615
你得走了。
You got to go.

1902
01:44:31,684 --> 01:44:32,782
你跑不过我的。
You can't outrun me.

1903
01:44:32,782 --> 01:44:35,323
我是太空牛仔!
I'm Space Cowboy!

1904
01:44:35,323 --> 01:44:36,456
雅虎
Yahoo!

1905
01:44:36,456 --> 01:44:38,249
你正在接近峡谷。
You are approaching the ravine.

1906
01:44:38,249 --> 01:44:39,459
没有别的地方可去了。
There's nowhere else to go.

1907
01:44:39,459 --> 01:44:41,252
-右转。继续。
- Turn right. Go on.

1908
01:44:41,252 --> 01:44:42,594
你没有选择。
You have no choice.

1909
01:44:42,594 --> 01:44:43,595
你得自己跳过去。
You're gonna have to make the jump.

1910
01:44:43,595 --> 01:44:46,598
倒数三，二，一。
In three, two, one.

1911
01:44:46,598 --> 01:44:49,931
Yeehaw !
Yeehaw!

1912
01:44:49,931 --> 01:44:51,471
哇，哇，哇，嘿，嘿，嘿。
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey.

1913
01:44:51,471 --> 01:44:53,099
和他在车里的是谁?
Who is that in the car with him?

1914
01:44:53,099 --> 01:44:55,772
我们正在拍摄呢，混蛋。
We're-we're in the middle of a take right now, asshole.

1915
01:44:55,772 --> 01:44:57,609
你在干什么?啊!
What are you doing? Ah!

1916
01:44:57,609 --> 01:44:59,677
他只是在引诱你。安全第一。就是这样。…噢!
He's just buckling you in. Safety first. That's it. -Ow!

1917
01:44:59,677 --> 01:45:01,976
真的很紧。这有必要吗?
It's really tight. Is this necessary?

1918
01:45:01,976 --> 01:45:04,011
嘿，我们正在拍戏呢。
Hey, we are filming right now.

1919
01:45:04,011 --> 01:45:06,178
继续拍，继续拍。
Keep rolling, keep rolling.

1920
01:45:06,178 --> 01:45:07,619
卖了吧，汤姆。看起来棒极了。深呼吸。
Sell it, Tom. It looks amazing. Take a deep breath.

1921
01:45:07,619 --> 01:45:09,819
这看起来不像，从车里出来。
It does not look-- Get out of the car.

1922
01:45:11,020 --> 01:45:12,217
你好。
Howdy.

1923
01:45:12,217 --> 01:45:14,186
-不，不，等等停止。不。
- No, no, wait. Stop. No.

1924
01:45:15,156 --> 01:45:16,221
等等，发生什么事了?
Wait, what's happening?

1925
01:45:16,221 --> 01:45:18,124
Yeehaw !
Yeehaw!

1926
01:45:18,124 --> 01:45:20,324
我的天啊!哇!
Oh, my God! Whoa!

1927
01:45:20,324 --> 01:45:22,568
快上车!
Get to the cars!

1928
01:45:25,538 --> 01:45:27,232
乔迪，你在搞什么鬼!
Jody, what the hell are you doing?!

1929
01:45:27,232 --> 01:45:28,233
我想从他嘴里问出点真心话，盖尔。
I'm trying to get something real out of him, Gail.

1930
01:45:28,233 --> 01:45:29,542
他身上没有摄像头!
There's no cameras on him!

1931
01:45:31,777 --> 01:45:34,811
嘿,丹?他们正在接近伏击巷。
Hey, Dan? They're approaching Ambush Alley right now.

1932
01:45:34,811 --> 01:45:36,076
我们已经做好了准备。
We're ready.

1933
01:45:37,682 --> 01:45:40,586
马上放我出去!
Let me out right now!

1934
01:45:40,586 --> 01:45:43,655
你要怎么做?你要杀了我?再一次?
What are you gonna do, huh? You gonna kill me? Again?!

1935
01:45:48,629 --> 01:45:50,794
-你能解开我吗?——没有。
- Can you untie me? - No.

1936
01:45:57,264 --> 01:45:58,868
麦凯布!
McCabe!

1937
01:45:58,868 --> 01:46:02,443
烟幕倒计时三，二，一!
Smoke screen in three, two, one!

1938
01:46:02,443 --> 01:46:04,368
哇!
Whoa!

1939
01:46:04,368 --> 01:46:06,304
这看起来不安全，伙计!
This does not seem safe, man!

1940
01:46:11,784 --> 01:46:14,521
丹，他们在哪里?你看到他们了吗?
Dan, where are they? Do you have eyes on them?

1941
01:46:14,521 --> 01:46:16,820
我看到了，一切都会按计划进行。
I see 'em. Everything's going to plan.

1942
01:46:19,561 --> 01:46:21,429
我要堵住这条路。
I'll block the road.

1943
01:46:21,429 --> 01:46:23,288
他们不能通过!
They shall not pass!

1944
01:46:23,288 --> 01:46:26,093
我看到他们了。他们正在进入伏击巷。
I see them. They're entering Ambush Alley.

1945
01:46:30,737 --> 01:46:32,440
我什么都看不见!
I can't see shit!

1946
01:46:34,235 --> 01:46:36,235
麦凯布,一个!
McCabe, one!

1947
01:46:37,172 --> 01:46:39,513
麦凯布,两个!
McCabe, two!

1948
01:46:42,978 --> 01:46:44,749
麦凯布!现在!
McCabe! Now!

1949
01:46:54,860 --> 01:46:56,431
我热爱我的工作。
I love my job.

1950
01:47:00,767 --> 01:47:04,571
哇,妈妈!
Whoa, mama!

1951
01:47:04,571 --> 01:47:06,903
哦,该死的!
Oh, goddamn!

1952
01:47:06,903 --> 01:47:10,940
你这样开车，我就没法好好思考了。-你应该已经死了。
I can't think straight when you drive like this. - You're supposed to be dead.

1953
01:47:10,940 --> 01:47:14,009
你炸成碎片了。
You blew up in-in a thousand pieces.

1954
01:47:14,009 --> 01:47:15,340
你炸了。
You went kaboom.

1955
01:47:15,340 --> 01:47:17,980
我为什么要爆炸，汤姆·莱德?
Why would I have blown up, Tom Ryder?

1956
01:47:17,980 --> 01:47:20,279
你为什么那样叫我的名字?
Why are you saying my name like that?

1957
01:47:20,279 --> 01:47:21,984
这是你的名字，对吧，汤姆·赖德?-是的,是的。
That is your name, isn't it, Tom Ryder? -Yes, yes.

1958
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:26,593
瞎子都能看出来你是-汤姆·莱德。-你的意思是…-“莱德，汤姆·莱德。”——好的。那就是我。
A blind man could see that you're - Tom Ryder. - You're saying that like... - "Ryder, Tom Ryder." - Okay. That's me.

1959
01:47:26,593 --> 01:47:27,858
你说得像个痴迷的女粉。
You're saying it like some obsessed fangirl.

1960
01:47:27,858 --> 01:47:29,354
这是我，柯尔特·西弗斯说的。
That's me, Colt Seavers, saying that.

1961
01:47:29,354 --> 01:47:30,927
转动摄像机。我们要跳下去了。
Roll the cameras. We're heading for the jump.

1962
01:47:30,927 --> 01:47:32,159
汤姆·莱德在表演他自己的特技!
Tom Ryder's doing his own stunts!

1963
01:47:32,159 --> 01:47:33,996
每个人,滚。手臂的车吗?
Everyone, roll. Arm car?

1964
01:47:33,996 --> 01:47:35,261
检查。
Check.

1965
01:47:35,261 --> 01:47:36,636
——直升机。—。
- Heli. -Check.

1966
01:47:36,636 --> 01:47:38,165
我不想再替你顶罪了。
I'm done taking the falls for you.

1967
01:47:38,165 --> 01:47:39,804
从现在开始你要自己表演特技了。
You're gonna do your own stunts from now on.

1968
01:47:39,804 --> 01:47:41,366
我不想自己表演特技，科特!放松。
I don't want to do my own stunts, Colt! -Relax.

1969
01:47:41,366 --> 01:47:43,434
不过是250英尺的跳跃，我们可能会丧命。
It's just a 250-foot jump that'll probably kill us.

1970
01:47:43,434 --> 01:47:45,975
以前从来没有人这样做过。是为动漫展准备的。
It's never been done before. It's for Comic-Con.

1971
01:47:45,975 --> 01:47:48,945
-是h厅，这可是件大事。-你在干什么，伙计?
- It's Hall H. It's a big deal. - What are you doing, man?

1972
01:47:48,945 --> 01:47:50,342
我觉得很合适。
I thought it'd be fitting.

1973
01:47:50,342 --> 01:47:52,685
我和你，汤姆·莱德，最后一次表演。
Me and you, Tom Ryder, one last stunt.

1974
01:47:52,685 --> 01:47:54,885
就像《末路狂花》
You know, like Thelma and Louise.

1975
01:47:54,885 --> 01:47:56,821
-末路狂花?-是的。
- Thelma and Louise? - Yeah.

1976
01:47:56,821 --> 01:47:59,054
-他们最后都死了。——到底!
- They die at the end. - Exactly!

1977
01:47:59,054 --> 01:48:00,957
自杀和谋杀不归路。
Murder-suicide.

1978
01:48:00,957 --> 01:48:02,926
你现在能靠边停车让我下车吗?
Can you just pull over and let me out right now?

1979
01:48:04,226 --> 01:48:09,130
汤姆·赖德，除非你告诉我柯尔特·西弗斯，真相，否则你别想下车!
You're not getting out of this car until you, Tom Ryder, tell me, Colt Seavers, the truth!

1980
01:48:09,130 --> 01:48:10,230
好了，好了，好了，好了!
All right, all right, all right, all right!

1981
01:48:10,230 --> 01:48:11,803
都是盖尔干的。
It was all Gail.

1982
01:48:11,803 --> 01:48:19,503
我杀亨利的时候，她想掩盖这件事因为说实话，太空牛仔是我演得最好的角色之一，柯尔特，我不想这部电影失败。
When I killed Henry, she wanted to cover it up because, to be honest, Space Cowboy's one of my best roles yet, Colt, and I don't want this movie to fail.

1983
01:48:19,503 --> 01:48:24,244
所以你是说盖尔·迈耶陷害我陷害你谋杀了亨利?
So you're saying that Gail Meyer was responsible for framing me for your murder of Henry?

1984
01:48:24,244 --> 01:48:26,147
是的!是的!
Yes! Yes!

1985
01:48:26,147 --> 01:48:27,918
你的真名是什么?
But what's your real name?

1986
01:48:27,918 --> 01:48:29,524
汤姆·赖德。
Tom Ryder.

1987
01:48:30,593 --> 01:48:32,021
你听到了吗，乔迪?
Did you get that, Jody?

1988
01:48:32,021 --> 01:48:34,419
我们找到了!他承认。
We got it! He confessed.

1989
01:48:34,419 --> 01:48:36,058
你带窃听器了吗?兄弟，你在录吗?
You wearing a wire? Bro, you recording this?

1990
01:48:36,058 --> 01:48:37,763
这是陷阱。你不能这么做。
This is entrapment. You can't do that.

1991
01:48:37,763 --> 01:48:41,965
-你在干什么?-不，这不是诱捕，因为你带着窃听器，蠢货!
- What are you doing? - No, it's not entrapment, because you're wearing the wire, dipshit!

1992
01:48:46,068 --> 01:48:47,399
他要去了。走了。走了。
He's going for it. Go. Go now.

1993
01:48:47,399 --> 01:48:48,906
我只是个演员!
I'm just an actor!

1994
01:48:48,906 --> 01:48:50,204
等待。
Wait.

1995
01:48:50,204 --> 01:48:52,041
他有一个护齿器。
He has a mouth guard.

1996
01:48:52,041 --> 01:48:54,615
我没有护齿器。
I don't have a mouth guard.

1997
01:49:42,456 --> 01:49:44,423
-太好了。小马!
- Oh, good. -Colt!

1998
01:49:44,423 --> 01:49:46,898
-你还活着。-你没事吧?
- You're alive. - Are you okay?

1999
01:49:48,262 --> 01:49:49,736
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

2000
01:49:49,736 --> 01:49:51,463
我说过我会补偿你的。
I told you I'd make the camera up to you.

2001
01:49:51,463 --> 01:49:53,267
哦，太棒了。
Oh, it was fantastic.

2002
01:49:53,267 --> 01:49:54,939
盖尔·德雷斯勒，请进!——啊!
GAIL Dressler, come in! -Ah!

2003
01:49:54,939 --> 01:49:57,568
你能听到我说话吗?我们得离开这里!
Oy, can you hear me? We've got to get out of here!

2004
01:49:57,568 --> 01:49:58,910
这都是盖尔的错，伙计。
RYDER This is all Gail's fault, man.

2005
01:49:58,910 --> 01:50:00,505
这都是盖尔的主意。
This is all Gail's idea.

2006
01:50:00,505 --> 01:50:01,913
-给我忏悔!——没有。
-Give me that confession! -  No.

2007
01:50:01,913 --> 01:50:03,783
把所有媒体都给我!你聋了吗?!
Give me all the media! Are you deaf?!

2008
01:50:03,783 --> 01:50:06,753
德雷斯勒，把直升机开到战壕。
Dressler, bring the helicopter to the trench.

2009
01:50:06,753 --> 01:50:07,952
-莱德呢?——现在!
- What about Ryder? - Now!

2010
01:50:07,952 --> 01:50:09,580
现在，关于这个日期。
Now, about this date.

2011
01:50:09,580 --> 01:50:12,154
把它放进箱子里，你这个笨蛋!
Put it in the case, you numpty!

2012
01:50:12,154 --> 01:50:13,485
我们可以称之为约会吗?
Can we call it a date?

2013
01:50:13,485 --> 01:50:16,521
我是说，事情就是这样，对吧?
I mean, that's what it is, right?

2014
01:50:16,521 --> 01:50:17,632
真是个白痴!
Such a moron!

2015
01:50:18,558 --> 01:50:21,493
-快点!上帝!——拿去吧。
- Hurry up! God! -  -Take it.

2016
01:50:21,493 --> 01:50:23,330
-盖尔，盖尔，盖尔。
- Gail, Gail, Gail.

2017
01:50:23,330 --> 01:50:25,431
-听…-把录音给我，盖尔
- Listen... - Give me the recording, Gail.

2018
01:50:25,431 --> 01:50:28,335
亲爱的，冷静点。跟我来。
Darling, calm down. Just come with me.

2019
01:50:28,335 --> 01:50:32,273
我们不需要这些有毒的男子气概，因为我们是一样的，你和我。
We don't need all this toxic masculinity, because we're the same, you and me.

2020
01:50:32,273 --> 01:50:34,110
你知道，我们是幸存者。
You know, we're survivors.

2021
01:50:34,110 --> 01:50:35,848
不，不，不。我一点也不像你。
No, no, no, no. I'm nothing like you.

2022
01:50:35,848 --> 01:50:41,018
我不想太冒昧，但我们还是有话直说吧。
I don't want to be presumptuous, I mean, but let's call a spade a spade.

2023
01:50:41,018 --> 01:50:42,855
所以我才给你这份工作。
That's why I gave you the job.

2024
