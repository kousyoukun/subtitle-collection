1
00:00:52,499 --> 00:00:55,499
David Wozniak, room 4.

2
00:00:55,903 --> 00:00:58,903
You have tissues, towels,
a pitcher of water and a sink.

3
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,240
You can settle in here.

4
00:01:01,241 --> 00:01:04,241
Here's all the reading material
you might need.

5
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:05,545
Your cup.

6
00:01:05,546 --> 00:01:08,546
When you're done, come see me.

7
00:02:04,238 --> 00:02:07,238
PAST DUE

8
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,030
David.

9
00:03:09,837 --> 00:03:12,472
David.

10
00:03:12,473 --> 00:03:15,473
I brought you your breakfast.

11
00:03:29,022 --> 00:03:32,022
OK! OK!

12
00:03:47,674 --> 00:03:50,674
Hey.

13
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,015
Dad's looking for you.
You're 45 minutes late.

14
00:03:56,016 --> 00:03:57,750
Can you move it this morning?

15
00:03:57,751 --> 00:03:59,919
Sure. Morning, Mom.

16
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,755
- You took the truck home again?
- Yup.

17
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:05,324
I asked you not to use
the delivery truck

18
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:07,093
for personal reasons.

19
00:04:07,094 --> 00:04:09,262
- Did you?
- But you do it anyway.

20
00:04:09,263 --> 00:04:10,596
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

21
00:04:10,597 --> 00:04:13,432
- Did you at least get the jerseys?
- Yes.

22
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:15,701
No, for real.

23
00:04:15,702 --> 00:04:17,770
Do you have the jerseys
for tonight?

24
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:20,771
Yes!

25
00:04:21,074 --> 00:04:24,074
Yes.

26
00:04:24,111 --> 00:04:27,111
Yes, yes!

27
00:04:28,115 --> 00:04:31,115
Yes, dear.

28
00:04:32,452 --> 00:04:35,452
Yes.

29
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:39,091
I should never have
knocked that woman up.

30
00:04:39,092 --> 00:04:42,092
Reproduction is a mistake.
Never reproduce.

31
00:04:42,763 --> 00:04:44,363
I've got a customer.

32
00:04:44,364 --> 00:04:46,566
- I gotta talk to you.
- Mr. Dubé.

33
00:04:46,567 --> 00:04:49,567
- Hang up! Hang up!
- Yeah. Bye.

34
00:04:49,903 --> 00:04:51,604
I gotta talk to you.

35
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:54,605
To help pay off my debts...

36
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:58,409
I set up a small hydroponic garden
in my apartment.

37
00:04:58,545 --> 00:04:59,612
You're growing pot?

38
00:04:59,613 --> 00:05:01,814
Yeah, but I'm having trouble,

39
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:04,815
and you're the only one I know
with a green thumb.

40
00:05:05,218 --> 00:05:08,218
You want me to help you grow pot.

41
00:05:08,388 --> 00:05:10,423
You've got a green thumb.

42
00:05:10,424 --> 00:05:13,326
Sure! Of course! Absolutely!

43
00:05:13,327 --> 00:05:16,327
That's the one thing I'm missing:
being part of a drug ring.

44
00:05:18,065 --> 00:05:20,766
Calls every three minutes
from my pregnant wife

45
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,935
aren't stressful enough.

46
00:05:22,936 --> 00:05:24,470
I wanna live a double life

47
00:05:24,471 --> 00:05:27,471
so I can get called in
to testify at a major drug trial.

48
00:05:28,842 --> 00:05:31,842
So, what do you say?

49
00:05:32,412 --> 00:05:34,347
No, David.

50
00:05:34,348 --> 00:05:37,348
My answer is no.

51
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:41,685
How much do you owe?

52
00:05:43,624 --> 00:05:46,092
How much do you owe?

53
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:48,694
Eighty.

54
00:05:48,695 --> 00:05:51,364
Eighty?

55
00:05:51,365 --> 00:05:52,632
Thousand.

56
00:05:52,633 --> 00:05:55,201
$80,000?

57
00:05:55,202 --> 00:05:58,202
When you say it with a face
like that, it sounds like a lot.

58
00:05:58,705 --> 00:06:00,606
David!

59
00:06:00,607 --> 00:06:03,476
You know I love you like a son.

60
00:06:03,477 --> 00:06:04,844
I am your son.

61
00:06:04,845 --> 00:06:06,779
Which is why I love you
like a son.

62
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,780
But if you don't have our jerseys
for the game tonight...

63
00:06:11,718 --> 00:06:13,619
I've got the jerseys.

64
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,888
It's the first game of the season.

65
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:18,889
They're taking the team picture.
We need the jerseys.

66
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:20,893
I have the jerseys.

67
00:06:20,894 --> 00:06:22,728
You ask him about the jerseys?

68
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:25,231
I have the jerseys.

69
00:06:25,232 --> 00:06:28,232
You were supposed to get them
three weeks ago.

70
00:06:28,468 --> 00:06:31,468
I have the jerseys!

71
00:06:34,741 --> 00:06:37,741
He obviously
doesn't have the jerseys.

72
00:06:38,578 --> 00:06:41,578
No.

73
00:06:51,892 --> 00:06:53,759
I was here first!

74
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,760
My blinkers were on.
I was backing up.

75
00:06:57,431 --> 00:07:00,431
I'm gonna have to ask you
to move your car, please.

76
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:05,269
I'm already parked.

77
00:07:05,372 --> 00:07:06,839
I'm here!

78
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,107
He came in from behind.

79
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:11,108
If I don't get those jerseys,
I'm a dead man.

80
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:14,211
Thank you!

81
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,787
HYDROPONICS

82
00:07:21,788 --> 00:07:24,788
HYDROPONIC GARDENING

83
00:07:27,728 --> 00:07:30,728
No rolling papers with this?

84
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,805
Your loan has been declined.

85
00:07:39,806 --> 00:07:41,373
If I don't find $80,000,

86
00:07:41,374 --> 00:07:44,374
men are gonna come to my house
and drown me.

87
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:47,478
Did you write that down,
that I'll be drowned?

88
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:50,149
You don't have
the required collateral.

89
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,952
That's why we can't
give you the money.

90
00:07:52,953 --> 00:07:55,154
If you have no assets
for us to seize,

91
00:07:55,155 --> 00:07:58,155
what guarantee do we have
that we won't lose our money?

92
00:07:58,992 --> 00:08:01,627
So, basically,
you're a big goddamn pawn shop.

93
00:08:01,628 --> 00:08:03,462
We're not a pawn shop.

94
00:08:03,463 --> 00:08:06,463
You're a big goddamn pawn shop
with fancier furniture.

95
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:09,135
So, I'm forced to decline
your application.

96
00:08:09,136 --> 00:08:11,570
I'm sorry.

97
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:14,571
Fine, I understand.

98
00:08:15,842 --> 00:08:18,244
This is a hold-up.

99
00:08:18,245 --> 00:08:19,979
Pardon me?

100
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,980
I said: "Fine, I understand. "

101
00:08:25,452 --> 00:08:27,019
This is a hold-up, asshole.

102
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,020
I've got the jerseys.

103
00:08:30,357 --> 00:08:33,357
I swear on our mother's grave!

104
00:08:34,661 --> 00:08:37,661
Yeah, Mom's!

105
00:08:37,864 --> 00:08:40,864
The jerseys are in the truck
as we speak.

106
00:09:19,672 --> 00:09:22,672
The whole point of a relationship
is to share the good moments,

107
00:09:23,008 --> 00:09:25,643
and the bad moments.

108
00:09:25,644 --> 00:09:28,644
But when you leave someone,
you lose those privileges.

109
00:09:28,747 --> 00:09:30,815
I never left you!

110
00:09:30,816 --> 00:09:32,817
You never call or email.

111
00:09:32,818 --> 00:09:35,818
- You're always trying to con me.
- No, I'm not!

112
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:38,156
- Why can't I come over?
- You can!

113
00:09:38,157 --> 00:09:40,425
What are you hiding
in your apartment?

114
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:42,160
You're imagining things!

115
00:09:42,161 --> 00:09:45,161
I never said that!
You can come whenever you want!

116
00:09:46,365 --> 00:09:49,365
I'm pregnant.

117
00:10:02,248 --> 00:10:03,715
I'll raise it on my own.

118
00:10:03,716 --> 00:10:05,283
What do you mean by that?

119
00:10:05,284 --> 00:10:08,284
I don't want a father who disappears
because he's too busy.

120
00:10:09,054 --> 00:10:12,054
I don't want a father
who doesn't have a life.

121
00:10:12,758 --> 00:10:15,360
- I do have a life.
- No, you don't.

122
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:17,929
You don't wake a pregnant woman up
at 2:00 a. m.!

123
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,197
I didn't know!

124
00:10:19,198 --> 00:10:22,198
If you called more often,
you would have.

125
00:10:22,234 --> 00:10:24,769
One day, this kid will ask
what you were like.

126
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,638
I'd rather be honest.

127
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:28,239
I'll say you weren't there

128
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,240
because you really had no interest
in being there.

129
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:34,245
But I am here.

130
00:10:34,246 --> 00:10:37,148
I'm here!

131
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:40,149
Valerie, I'm right here!

132
00:10:40,653 --> 00:10:43,653
Sure, it came as
a bit of a shock at first.

133
00:10:44,223 --> 00:10:47,223
A real big shock, actually.

134
00:10:47,426 --> 00:10:50,426
But the fear wore off right away
and I thought:

135
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:53,564
It's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

136
00:10:53,565 --> 00:10:54,732
No!

137
00:10:54,733 --> 00:10:57,402
Etienne, get back to bed.

138
00:10:57,403 --> 00:11:00,403
It's 3:00 in the morning.
Back to bed!

139
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:03,508
It's time to sleep. Go to bed!

140
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:05,343
Where are you going?

141
00:11:05,344 --> 00:11:10,581
Not in the sandbox!

142
00:11:10,582 --> 00:11:12,517
Talk her into an abortion.

143
00:11:12,518 --> 00:11:14,452
What?

144
00:11:14,453 --> 00:11:17,453
You can't say things like that
in front of your kids.

145
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:20,589
My kids know they're too old
to be aborted.

146
00:11:20,859 --> 00:11:23,859
I'm telling you that I think
I might want to have a child.

147
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:26,864
David...

148
00:11:26,865 --> 00:11:28,866
you're free.

149
00:11:28,867 --> 00:11:30,702
You're a free man.

150
00:11:30,703 --> 00:11:32,937
Believe me,
you don't want children.

151
00:11:32,938 --> 00:11:35,606
They're like...

152
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:38,209
black holes that suck up
all your energy,

153
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,378
all your time, all your money,

154
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:41,479
all your hair.

155
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,480
Do you remember
when I had hair, David?

156
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,485
I can't get it up anymore.
It's as simple as that.

157
00:11:47,486 --> 00:11:49,854
How can you say that
in front of your kids?

158
00:11:49,855 --> 00:11:52,657
I can say whatever I want.
They don't listen to me.

159
00:11:52,658 --> 00:11:55,560
They don't pick up
the frequency of my voice.

160
00:11:55,561 --> 00:11:58,561
I can't get a decent hard-on.

161
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,630
At my age, it isn't normal
not to have a full erection.

162
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,700
I should wake up with
a raging boner every morning.

163
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,738
That's what my life should be.

164
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:09,507
No, sweetie pie, back to bed.

165
00:12:09,508 --> 00:12:11,242
It's 3:00 in the morning.

166
00:12:11,243 --> 00:12:14,243
Not in the sandbox. You too?

167
00:12:16,415 --> 00:12:18,483
No!

168
00:12:18,484 --> 00:12:21,484
Go to sleep!

169
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,187
I want a child.

170
00:12:23,188 --> 00:12:25,890
David, as your friend
and your lawyer, can I -

171
00:12:25,891 --> 00:12:27,258
Daddy!

172
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:30,259
Can I be brutally honest with you?

173
00:12:30,896 --> 00:12:31,929
Yes.

174
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,930
You are in no way capable
of raising a child.

175
00:12:35,901 --> 00:12:37,235
I want order in my life.

176
00:12:37,236 --> 00:12:40,236
You think this is order?

177
00:12:40,272 --> 00:12:41,372
Yeah.

178
00:12:41,373 --> 00:12:44,373
This is beautiful.

179
00:12:48,447 --> 00:12:51,447
Valerie!

180
00:12:55,621 --> 00:12:57,622
I've decided to make some changes.

181
00:12:57,623 --> 00:13:00,358
I'm working right now.

182
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:03,359
I'm gonna show you I'm worthy
of being the father of that child.

183
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,930
David Wozniak.

184
00:13:40,999 --> 00:13:43,668
The name's Chamberlain.

185
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:45,670
The kitchen door was kicked in.

186
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:48,671
I'm a lawyer.
I've been trying to reach you.

187
00:13:52,678 --> 00:13:55,580
I don't have a lot of time.
I'll be brief.

188
00:13:55,581 --> 00:13:58,581
Between 1988 and 1990,

189
00:13:59,017 --> 00:14:02,017
you donated sperm,
under the alias of "Starbuck"

190
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,020
at the LaFrance Clinic,
which I represent.

191
00:14:05,991 --> 00:14:08,991
You made 693 donations
over a 23-month period,

192
00:14:09,661 --> 00:14:12,661
in exchange for which you received
$24,255 in compensation.

193
00:14:14,032 --> 00:14:16,100
You have high-quality sperm.

194
00:14:16,101 --> 00:14:19,101
I'm sure yours isn't so bad either.

195
00:14:20,472 --> 00:14:23,207
Due to certain complications
during a given period,

196
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:26,208
Mr. LaFrance ended up giving
your sperm to all his clients.

197
00:14:26,445 --> 00:14:29,347
As a result,
you have fathered 533 children,

198
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:32,348
142 of whom
wish to know your identity.

199
00:14:34,052 --> 00:14:37,052
You have fathered 533 children.

200
00:14:39,191 --> 00:14:41,325
At each of your donation sessions,

201
00:14:41,326 --> 00:14:43,728
you signed a confidentiality clause.

202
00:14:43,729 --> 00:14:46,729
The clinic is thus legally bound
to protect your identity.

203
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:49,999
Some of the children plan to contest
the legality of these documents.

204
00:14:51,136 --> 00:14:54,136
They want to know who Starbuck is.

205
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:15,090
So, you say each of the 693 times
you donated sperm,

206
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:18,329
you signed a confidentiality clause.

207
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,731
I signed one every single time.

208
00:15:20,732 --> 00:15:23,732
Did you sign before or after
you choked the chicken?

209
00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:26,204
- Before.
- You always beat your meat alone?

210
00:15:26,205 --> 00:15:27,271
Yeah.

211
00:15:27,272 --> 00:15:30,272
And you deposited your man juice
in little plastic cups.

212
00:15:31,243 --> 00:15:34,243
Did the little plastic cups
consent every time?

213
00:15:35,547 --> 00:15:37,081
Should I get another lawyer?

214
00:15:37,082 --> 00:15:40,082
Honestly, I'm a bit hurt
you never mentioned it at the time.

215
00:15:40,719 --> 00:15:43,719
You call your friend after
sleeping with a hot girl,

216
00:15:44,056 --> 00:15:45,523
not after jerking off.

217
00:15:45,524 --> 00:15:48,292
But from now on,
every time I masturbate,

218
00:15:48,293 --> 00:15:51,293
I'll call you up
and fill you in on all the details.

219
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,965
No need. Listen up.

220
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:56,966
They claim your right to privacy
should take a back seat

221
00:15:57,069 --> 00:16:00,069
to the basic human rights
they say have been violated.

222
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:02,373
It's complex.

223
00:16:02,374 --> 00:16:04,308
Very complex.

224
00:16:04,309 --> 00:16:05,943
Extremely complex.

225
00:16:05,944 --> 00:16:08,944
Every lawyer dreams of defending
a case this significant!

226
00:16:10,482 --> 00:16:13,482
It'll go down in the history books.
It'll set a legal precedent.

227
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:17,319
My mother always told me
I'd never amount to anything.

228
00:16:18,323 --> 00:16:21,323
I'm gonna show the old bitch.

229
00:16:21,627 --> 00:16:23,127
I don't feel very good.

230
00:16:23,128 --> 00:16:25,630
Postpartum depression.

231
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:28,499
533 times over.

232
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,302
You might feel a little down.

233
00:16:31,303 --> 00:16:32,336
What do I do?

234
00:16:32,337 --> 00:16:35,337
For now, I advise you to stop
whacking off in fertility clinics.

235
00:16:36,241 --> 00:16:38,342
Should I get a real lawyer?

236
00:16:38,343 --> 00:16:40,311
You can't afford a real lawyer.

237
00:16:40,312 --> 00:16:43,312
I'll call the Bar this afternoon
and get my license back.

238
00:16:44,082 --> 00:16:46,183
- You're not licensed?
- A formality.

239
00:16:46,184 --> 00:16:49,184
It's just a matter of a few dates
and some paperwork.

240
00:16:49,321 --> 00:16:50,688
And a bribe or two.

241
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:52,490
Here.

242
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:53,658
What's that?

243
00:16:53,659 --> 00:16:56,659
The 142 children in the class action
want you to know who they are.

244
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:01,430
Those are their profiles.

245
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,700
They're not my children.

246
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:04,859
These are the months
of the year...

247
00:18:11,535 --> 00:18:13,603
Do you have a babysitter?

248
00:18:13,604 --> 00:18:16,604
Like right here, right now?

249
00:18:16,874 --> 00:18:18,508
To baby-sit your envelope?

250
00:18:18,509 --> 00:18:21,509
- I opened the envelope.
- Crap.

251
00:18:21,512 --> 00:18:24,114
I shouldn't have. I know.

252
00:18:24,115 --> 00:18:26,282
I looked at one profile. Just one.

253
00:18:26,283 --> 00:18:28,618
I picked it out at random.

254
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:31,619
One. Wanna know who it is?

255
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,960
Ricardo Donatelli.

256
00:18:49,907 --> 00:18:51,641
There he is. There!

257
00:18:51,642 --> 00:18:54,642
That's him, number 14.
You see him?

258
00:19:10,227 --> 00:19:11,294
Sit down!

259
00:19:11,295 --> 00:19:14,295
Let go of me!

260
00:19:43,327 --> 00:19:46,327
Move it! Move it!

261
00:20:35,713 --> 00:20:38,713
My genes were on
a professional-soccer pitch!

262
00:20:39,517 --> 00:20:40,683
It's crazy.

263
00:20:40,684 --> 00:20:43,684
It's like an extension of me
scored the game-winner.

264
00:20:47,091 --> 00:20:50,091
So, do your kids play
on a professional soccer team?

265
00:20:50,427 --> 00:20:52,328
Not that I know of.

266
00:20:52,329 --> 00:20:55,329
But I'll ask.
They don't tell me everything.

267
00:20:58,736 --> 00:21:01,736
I was thinking we should consider
an insanity plea.

268
00:21:03,841 --> 00:21:05,775
What?

269
00:21:05,776 --> 00:21:08,776
You can't be held responsible
for your actions if you were...

270
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,415
mentally unstable.

271
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:15,416
We'll play up your mental problems.

272
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,920
But I don't have mental problems.

273
00:21:22,426 --> 00:21:24,761
I don't have mental problems!

274
00:21:24,762 --> 00:21:27,730
That's exactly how
I want you to say it in court.

275
00:21:27,731 --> 00:21:31,165
Let's go, Reds!

276
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:36,370
We're starting!
Come on, David!

277
00:21:37,741 --> 00:21:40,741
Give it to me!

278
00:21:43,647 --> 00:21:46,647
Go! Go!

279
00:21:50,554 --> 00:21:53,554
What position is he playing,
for Christ's sake?

280
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:17,614
Hello.

281
00:22:17,615 --> 00:22:20,416
Yeah, it's me.
What are you doing?

282
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:23,417
You should've been here
15 minutes ago.

283
00:22:24,321 --> 00:22:26,856
Are you messing with me?

284
00:22:26,857 --> 00:22:29,857
Yes, it's this afternoon!

285
00:22:30,427 --> 00:22:33,129
I wrote it down on the schedule
three days ago!

286
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:36,130
Yeah, it's there.

287
00:22:38,168 --> 00:22:40,637
So, what am I supposed to do?

288
00:22:40,638 --> 00:22:42,338
Finish up what you're doing.

289
00:22:42,339 --> 00:22:45,339
I'll call and tell them
I'll be an hour late.

290
00:22:45,442 --> 00:22:48,442
OK, hold on a sec.

291
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,280
A large coffee to go, please.

292
00:22:54,051 --> 00:22:57,051
Come on, man,
give me a break!

293
00:22:57,187 --> 00:22:59,822
Forget it, I'll work it out.

294
00:22:59,823 --> 00:23:02,823
Thanks, you're a pal!

295
00:23:13,837 --> 00:23:16,837
It was to go.

296
00:23:22,646 --> 00:23:23,880
Thanks.

297
00:23:23,881 --> 00:23:26,881
That's $2.25.

298
00:23:39,697 --> 00:23:42,697
You could be more polite.

299
00:23:43,434 --> 00:23:44,534
I'm sorry?

300
00:23:44,535 --> 00:23:46,769
I'm the customer.
You're the waiter.

301
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,438
A "please" and "thank you"...

302
00:23:48,439 --> 00:23:50,406
What is this?

303
00:23:50,407 --> 00:23:52,008
If you wanna be a waiter -

304
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:53,876
That's the problem.

305
00:23:53,877 --> 00:23:56,877
I don't wanna be a waiter.
I'm an actor.

306
00:23:57,848 --> 00:23:59,749
Who's missing a huge audition.

307
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,750
And you want me to smile for $2.25?

308
00:24:04,588 --> 00:24:07,588
While the opportunity of a lifetime
is passing me by?

309
00:24:09,393 --> 00:24:12,295
Doesn't have to be a big smile.

310
00:24:12,296 --> 00:24:15,296
OK.

311
00:24:15,933 --> 00:24:18,933
Have a nice day.

312
00:24:36,453 --> 00:24:39,255
Yes?

313
00:24:39,256 --> 00:24:42,256
You go. I'll fill in for you here.

314
00:24:43,727 --> 00:24:45,261
Who'd know the difference?

315
00:24:45,262 --> 00:24:47,897
We do get customers
in here sometimes.

316
00:24:47,898 --> 00:24:49,465
Isn't this your big chance?

317
00:24:49,466 --> 00:24:52,466
How do I know
you won't run away with the cash?

318
00:24:55,072 --> 00:24:58,072
Take my delivery truck.
It's full of meat.

319
00:24:59,977 --> 00:25:01,144
What's in it for you?

320
00:25:01,145 --> 00:25:04,145
The satisfaction of making
a difference in someone's life.

321
00:25:06,984 --> 00:25:09,984
Bring it back without a scratch.

322
00:25:13,423 --> 00:25:14,690
People might come in.

323
00:25:14,691 --> 00:25:17,360
I can figure out
how to make a cup of coffee.

324
00:25:17,361 --> 00:25:20,361
Fly!

325
00:25:20,664 --> 00:25:23,664
Go, go, go!

326
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:26,667
You know you have the easiest job
in the whole shop?

327
00:25:27,471 --> 00:25:30,006
And just so I'm being clear,

328
00:25:30,007 --> 00:25:32,141
by that, I mean you're a moron.

329
00:25:32,142 --> 00:25:35,142
And yet despite how
mind-blowingly simple your job is,

330
00:25:35,345 --> 00:25:37,880
you always manage
to mess it up somehow.

331
00:25:37,881 --> 00:25:40,316
It's like every day,

332
00:25:40,317 --> 00:25:43,317
you find a new way
to push the limits of stupidity.

333
00:25:43,954 --> 00:25:46,954
Essentially, you've only got
two things to do.

334
00:25:47,524 --> 00:25:48,825
Two!

335
00:25:48,826 --> 00:25:51,826
Get meat.
Deliver meat.

336
00:25:52,462 --> 00:25:54,463
The phone's ringing off the hook.

337
00:25:54,464 --> 00:25:55,865
Apparently, today,

338
00:25:55,866 --> 00:25:58,866
you forgot to do
one of those two things.

339
00:25:59,336 --> 00:26:01,237
You forgot the delivery part!

340
00:26:01,238 --> 00:26:03,372
No, I'm doing the deliveries now.

341
00:26:03,373 --> 00:26:05,541
I'm delivering my ass off
as we speak.

342
00:26:05,542 --> 00:26:08,044
You're more of a meat watchman.

343
00:26:08,045 --> 00:26:11,045
Today, all you're doing
is watching the meat.

344
00:26:11,181 --> 00:26:14,180
I'll have a "tell-me-who-you-are-
before-I-call-the police".

345
00:26:17,553 --> 00:26:19,054
The waiter.

346
00:26:19,055 --> 00:26:21,423
I'm the owner.
I do all the hiring.

347
00:26:21,424 --> 00:26:24,424
I'm filling in for Etienne.
He had an important audition.

348
00:26:24,527 --> 00:26:27,527
He can find himself another job.

349
00:26:28,397 --> 00:26:30,565
Sir...

350
00:26:30,566 --> 00:26:33,566
It's the role of a lifetime.
Cut him some slack.

351
00:26:33,903 --> 00:26:36,504
Slack really isn't the problem here.

352
00:26:36,505 --> 00:26:38,573
- What is it then?
- He's no good.

353
00:26:38,574 --> 00:26:41,574
He can't act.
He never gets a role. Ever.

354
00:26:41,577 --> 00:26:43,044
He sucks.

355
00:26:43,045 --> 00:26:46,045
I'll let you tell him
he's not a waiter anymore.

356
00:26:46,215 --> 00:26:49,215
Let him know it's your fault
if he can't make his rent.

357
00:27:14,543 --> 00:27:17,543
I lost my job?

358
00:27:17,747 --> 00:27:20,448
Yeah.

359
00:27:20,449 --> 00:27:22,951
I got the part.

360
00:27:22,952 --> 00:27:24,819
You did?

361
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,820
Yeah.

362
00:27:28,391 --> 00:27:33,393
Thanks.

363
00:27:39,468 --> 00:27:42,468
Where were you yesterday?

364
00:27:42,672 --> 00:27:45,672
You were supposed to be here at noon.

365
00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:49,309
I started, but I can't
do it all by myself!

366
00:27:49,779 --> 00:27:52,779
No.

367
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:57,250
I'll be two seconds!

368
00:27:59,588 --> 00:28:02,588
Hold on. Don't go anywhere.

369
00:28:06,495 --> 00:28:09,130
- Hello. That'll be $11.50.
- I'm $4 short.

370
00:28:09,131 --> 00:28:12,131
I knew you were gonna
fucking bail on me!

371
00:28:14,136 --> 00:28:17,136
How the hell am I supposed
to pay the rent?

372
00:28:18,007 --> 00:28:21,007
And you owe me money, too!
Am I gonna see any of that?

373
00:28:22,278 --> 00:28:25,113
Fuck off and die!

374
00:28:25,114 --> 00:28:27,515
You said May!

375
00:28:27,516 --> 00:28:30,516
Shut up! Shut up!
You're a goddamn liar.

376
00:28:30,953 --> 00:28:32,988
You're a goddamn liar!

377
00:28:32,989 --> 00:28:35,989
How am I gonna pay for this?
I don't have a fucking cent!

378
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:39,125
You owe me money!
I want it back! Stop it!

379
00:28:39,362 --> 00:28:42,362
Stop it!

380
00:28:47,169 --> 00:28:49,404
Miss?

381
00:28:49,405 --> 00:28:52,405
Don't worry about the $4.

382
00:28:53,876 --> 00:28:55,176
Miss?

383
00:28:55,177 --> 00:28:58,177
I don't know who you are,
but this isn't a good time, OK?

384
00:28:58,247 --> 00:29:00,181
Get out of my apartment.

385
00:29:00,182 --> 00:29:02,417
Sure, sure. Absolutely.

386
00:29:02,418 --> 00:29:03,885
But I...

387
00:29:03,886 --> 00:29:05,553
I'm gonna call the cops!

388
00:29:05,554 --> 00:29:08,554
No, no need for that!

389
00:29:10,693 --> 00:29:12,894
But you sound really upset.

390
00:29:12,895 --> 00:29:15,730
And we have a very strict policy

391
00:29:15,731 --> 00:29:18,731
about the state of mind
in which we leave our customers.

392
00:29:19,402 --> 00:29:21,236
My boss is a real stickler.

393
00:29:21,237 --> 00:29:24,237
He always says: "At...

394
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:27,340
"At Rigoletto Pizzeria,
we care about our customers.

395
00:29:29,178 --> 00:29:32,178
"We believe in
a more human approach to pizza. "

396
00:29:35,885 --> 00:29:38,885
Are you all right?

397
00:29:43,893 --> 00:29:46,893
Are you all right?

398
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,070
No. Fuck, no!

399
00:30:09,485 --> 00:30:12,220
Let go!

400
00:30:12,221 --> 00:30:14,789
Julie.

401
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:17,092
- Let go! I want out of here!
- Julie!

402
00:30:17,093 --> 00:30:20,093
I wanna get out of here!
Let go of me!

403
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:24,330
Who are you, exactly?

404
00:30:34,944 --> 00:30:37,944
Are you ashamed to admit
you're my father?

405
00:30:42,017 --> 00:30:43,151
No.

406
00:30:43,152 --> 00:30:46,152
You have to sign my release.

407
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:50,490
Can I have a word with you?

408
00:30:55,498 --> 00:30:56,598
The good news is,

409
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:59,599
a spot just opened up
in our methadone program.

410
00:31:00,469 --> 00:31:01,503
The bad news is,

411
00:31:01,504 --> 00:31:04,504
your daughter has no interest
in the program.

412
00:31:04,874 --> 00:31:07,809
She's still a minor,
so it's up to you.

413
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,144
I...

414
00:31:09,145 --> 00:31:12,145
We get excellent results.

415
00:31:13,382 --> 00:31:16,382
I'll talk to her.

416
00:31:22,525 --> 00:31:25,525
Can we...

417
00:31:28,164 --> 00:31:29,531
Hi...

418
00:31:29,532 --> 00:31:32,532
Dad.

419
00:31:34,637 --> 00:31:37,372
Sign the release.

420
00:31:37,373 --> 00:31:40,373
I don't know who you are,
but I'm begging you.

421
00:31:40,376 --> 00:31:43,211
- They have a good program.
- I can quit on my own.

422
00:31:43,212 --> 00:31:45,046
I just had the scare of my life.

423
00:31:45,047 --> 00:31:46,548
I think the program -

424
00:31:46,549 --> 00:31:49,549
I'd be surrounded by junkies
24 hours a day here.

425
00:31:49,985 --> 00:31:51,586
I'll have a relapse for sure.

426
00:31:51,587 --> 00:31:53,221
They'll help you.

427
00:31:53,222 --> 00:31:55,890
They'll lock me up,
and I'll lose my job.

428
00:31:55,891 --> 00:31:58,891
I just started. It's my dream job.
It's all I've got.

429
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:06,399
Thank you.

430
00:32:17,012 --> 00:32:18,580
I'm signing the release.

431
00:32:18,581 --> 00:32:20,582
You're making a huge mistake.

432
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:21,883
She'd be unhappy here.

433
00:32:21,884 --> 00:32:24,252
Right now,
she doesn't need to be happy.

434
00:32:24,253 --> 00:32:25,920
She needs to get clean.

435
00:32:25,921 --> 00:32:28,921
She's gonna quit.

436
00:32:29,592 --> 00:32:32,592
Do you love your daughter?

437
00:32:33,295 --> 00:32:36,130
- Yes.
- Tell her that.

438
00:32:36,131 --> 00:32:39,131
Then tell her
you won't sign her release.

439
00:32:56,218 --> 00:32:57,952
Where do you work?

440
00:32:57,953 --> 00:32:59,988
At Ogilvy, on Sainte-Catherine.

441
00:32:59,989 --> 00:33:02,989
I never finished school.
A friend got me the job.

442
00:33:06,262 --> 00:33:09,262
- You have my phone number?
- Yeah.

443
00:33:09,832 --> 00:33:12,233
- Tomorrow, you start work at...
- 8:00.

444
00:33:12,234 --> 00:33:15,234
- And you'll be there at...
- 8:00.

445
00:33:16,238 --> 00:33:19,238
I tend to make some very,
very bad decisions.

446
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:24,310
I'd like you to prove to me
that this isn't one of them.

447
00:33:25,314 --> 00:33:28,314
You made the right choice.

448
00:33:31,186 --> 00:33:34,186
Thanks, Dad.

449
00:35:43,251 --> 00:35:46,251
...but it's the first time
I really injured myself.

450
00:35:46,754 --> 00:35:49,456
It's rare to welcome outsiders
to our colony,

451
00:35:49,457 --> 00:35:51,725
especially since
the Iroquois resumed

452
00:35:51,726 --> 00:35:54,726
their attacks on our settlers.

453
00:36:35,703 --> 00:36:38,703
That's very nice of you. Thanks.

454
00:36:47,682 --> 00:36:50,550
It's rare to welcome outsiders
to our colony,

455
00:36:50,551 --> 00:36:52,819
especially since
the Iroquois resumed

456
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:55,820
their attacks on our settlers.

457
00:37:03,297 --> 00:37:06,297
Push!

458
00:37:18,713 --> 00:37:21,713
Cheapskate!

459
00:37:40,401 --> 00:37:43,203
It's rare to welcome outsiders
to our colony,

460
00:37:43,204 --> 00:37:44,905
especially since the Iroquois

461
00:37:44,906 --> 00:37:47,906
resumed their attacks
on our settlers.

462
00:38:07,395 --> 00:38:09,796
Watch where you're going.

463
00:38:09,797 --> 00:38:12,797
I think he's an inspector.

464
00:38:21,876 --> 00:38:24,876
We need a hand!

465
00:38:30,051 --> 00:38:32,319
Did you say "yum-yum"?

466
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,955
I'm not sure I heard you right.

467
00:38:34,956 --> 00:38:36,756
- Did you say "yum-yum"?
- Yeah.

468
00:38:36,757 --> 00:38:39,757
Don't say "yum-yum"!

469
00:38:42,763 --> 00:38:44,564
I had a revelation.

470
00:38:44,565 --> 00:38:47,565
I realized it's impossible
to be a father to 533 children.

471
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,404
It's impossible.
It can't be done.

472
00:38:51,405 --> 00:38:52,906
It can't be done with four.

473
00:38:52,907 --> 00:38:55,642
Exactly, it's impossible.

474
00:38:55,643 --> 00:38:57,611
But I can be their guardian angel.

475
00:38:57,612 --> 00:38:59,813
- Their guardian angel?
- Yeah.

476
00:38:59,814 --> 00:39:02,814
I realized these kids
need someone in their lives...

477
00:39:04,085 --> 00:39:06,286
someone to watch over them.

478
00:39:06,287 --> 00:39:08,922
I'm the donor.

479
00:39:08,923 --> 00:39:11,157
They're my responsibility.

480
00:39:11,158 --> 00:39:13,126
And I accept that responsibility.

481
00:39:13,127 --> 00:39:14,494
So, you're telling me,

482
00:39:14,495 --> 00:39:16,129
your mission here on Earth

483
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:19,130
is to watch over 533 children
like some sort of superhero.

484
00:39:21,168 --> 00:39:22,969
I didn't say superhero.

485
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:25,970
When you're watching over them,
are you wearing Lycra?

486
00:39:26,941 --> 00:39:29,941
I didn't say superhero.
I said guardian angel.

487
00:39:30,111 --> 00:39:31,344
So, no Lycra,

488
00:39:31,345 --> 00:39:34,345
but you have wings
and you play the harp.

489
00:39:35,449 --> 00:39:37,484
You know what?

490
00:39:37,485 --> 00:39:40,485
I'm feeling more and more comfortable
with an insanity plea.

491
00:39:41,455 --> 00:39:44,190
I don't have mental problems.

492
00:39:44,191 --> 00:39:45,625
Perfect.

493
00:39:45,626 --> 00:39:48,626
Say it just like that
to the judge.

494
00:39:48,696 --> 00:39:51,164
I haven't slept in four days.

495
00:39:51,165 --> 00:39:54,165
I've never been happier
in all my life.

496
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:58,870
I never thought
I could love anyone this much.

497
00:40:01,042 --> 00:40:03,209
He poops eight times a day,

498
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:05,311
and I think I've lost my mind,

499
00:40:05,312 --> 00:40:06,980
because I swear,

500
00:40:06,981 --> 00:40:09,883
I worship every single one
of his diapers.

501
00:40:09,884 --> 00:40:12,218
Your brother wants to go
on parental leave

502
00:40:12,219 --> 00:40:15,219
so he can have more time
to worship his son's dirty diapers.

503
00:40:15,723 --> 00:40:17,857
I'm entitled by law
to parental leave.

504
00:40:17,858 --> 00:40:19,259
I have three kids.

505
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,028
Two hours after each was born,
I was here.

506
00:40:22,029 --> 00:40:25,029
Which is why your 11-year-old son
hardly recognizes you.

507
00:40:25,032 --> 00:40:28,032
When he comes by, he asks me:
"Which one is my dad?"

508
00:40:30,337 --> 00:40:33,337
You gotta have kids, too, David.

509
00:40:38,212 --> 00:40:41,212
Thanks.

510
00:40:48,289 --> 00:40:51,289
Hey there.

511
00:40:53,194 --> 00:40:55,261
Today's my first ultrasound.

512
00:40:55,262 --> 00:40:57,597
Is it?

513
00:40:57,598 --> 00:41:00,433
- I need a friend, not a father.
- I'm your friend.

514
00:41:00,434 --> 00:41:03,434
- I want to be clear.
- It's clear.

515
00:41:04,305 --> 00:41:07,305
Hurry up. I drank a liter of water
and I'm not allowed to pee.

516
00:41:08,776 --> 00:41:10,643
Are you going to ask the sex?

517
00:41:10,644 --> 00:41:11,911
I want a girl.

518
00:41:11,912 --> 00:41:14,912
- That's not how it works.
- I want a girl.

519
00:41:15,049 --> 00:41:18,049
It'll be a girl.

520
00:41:19,253 --> 00:41:22,253
Here you can see
your baby's profile.

521
00:41:25,726 --> 00:41:28,428
There's a little hand
coming into the frame.

522
00:41:28,429 --> 00:41:30,230
There's the profile,

523
00:41:30,231 --> 00:41:32,799
with a little hand just above it.

524
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,001
And the little face.

525
00:41:35,002 --> 00:41:38,002
There's the heart beating,
which you can see clearly.

526
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:41,639
See?

527
00:41:41,942 --> 00:41:44,942
Let's look at the circumference
of the head.

528
00:41:46,247 --> 00:41:48,748
I'm not so sure about this.

529
00:41:48,749 --> 00:41:49,816
About what?

530
00:41:49,817 --> 00:41:52,817
Whether this baby
will be a source of happiness.

531
00:41:54,588 --> 00:41:57,524
Look at them. Look!

532
00:41:57,525 --> 00:41:58,958
Look at that one!

533
00:41:58,959 --> 00:42:01,959
I've watched him for 10 seconds,
and already I wanna smack him.

534
00:42:02,496 --> 00:42:05,496
I swear, it's all I can do
to keep from kicking him in the ass.

535
00:42:08,836 --> 00:42:10,370
It'll be fine, Valerie.

536
00:42:10,371 --> 00:42:12,639
Sure, you can be
a bit anal-retentive...

537
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,508
Remember that woman
who drowned her two kids?

538
00:42:15,509 --> 00:42:18,111
I think I'm the only person
on the planet

539
00:42:18,112 --> 00:42:20,847
who thought she made
a convincing argument.

540
00:42:20,848 --> 00:42:23,183
I'm not saying
the kids deserved to die,

541
00:42:23,184 --> 00:42:26,184
but they could've listened,
for Christ's sake!

542
00:42:28,489 --> 00:42:31,489
I think it's the best thing
that could've happened to us.

543
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:34,027
Who made you the Dalai Lama?

544
00:42:34,028 --> 00:42:36,696
What the hell does that mean?

545
00:42:36,697 --> 00:42:39,032
Look at that one!
He's eating his boogers!

546
00:42:39,033 --> 00:42:40,533
They're full of protein.

547
00:42:40,534 --> 00:42:43,534
Valerie, did you know
we all have...

548
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,308
tremendous untapped resources
inside of us?

549
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:51,211
Resources? What do you mean,
"untapped resources"?

550
00:42:51,212 --> 00:42:54,047
Here's what I know about my resources:

551
00:42:54,048 --> 00:42:57,048
My kid looks at me like that,
he gets a smack upside the head.

552
00:42:58,586 --> 00:43:01,586
You're gonna be a good mother.

553
00:43:05,392 --> 00:43:08,392
OK.

554
00:43:09,997 --> 00:43:12,997
Because I don't trust you at all,
what I'm gonna do is...

555
00:43:14,001 --> 00:43:15,935
I'll name you... No.

556
00:43:15,936 --> 00:43:18,104
I'll declare you as the father...

557
00:43:18,105 --> 00:43:19,906
Yes!

558
00:43:19,907 --> 00:43:22,408
- Yes!
- No, wait.

559
00:43:22,409 --> 00:43:25,244
I'll declare you
father-on-a-trial-basis.

560
00:43:25,245 --> 00:43:28,245
- Father-on-a-trial-basis!
- Zero screw-ups allowed.

561
00:43:28,248 --> 00:43:31,248
- For how long?
- Forever.

562
00:43:32,118 --> 00:43:34,953
OK.

563
00:43:34,954 --> 00:43:37,954
Will the kid have to call me
Trial Basis Dad?

564
00:43:38,291 --> 00:43:39,391
No.

565
00:43:39,392 --> 00:43:42,392
Will I have any kind of costume
or sign to wear...

566
00:43:44,697 --> 00:43:47,633
that'll set me apart
from the regular dads?

567
00:43:47,634 --> 00:43:50,469
No.

568
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:53,470
Then I accept.

569
00:44:15,561 --> 00:44:16,962
Your name?

570
00:44:16,963 --> 00:44:19,963
Léopold Duval.

571
00:44:21,234 --> 00:44:24,136
And you are...

572
00:44:24,137 --> 00:44:27,137
A friend.

573
00:44:50,163 --> 00:44:53,163
He's over there.

574
00:44:59,205 --> 00:45:00,339
OK, I'll be back.

575
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:02,307
You're not staying for a visit?

576
00:45:02,308 --> 00:45:04,977
I wanted to see him. I saw him.

577
00:45:04,978 --> 00:45:06,478
I'll come back later.

578
00:45:06,479 --> 00:45:09,479
It would make him really happy.

579
00:45:09,649 --> 00:45:12,217
Yeah.

580
00:45:12,218 --> 00:45:13,318
But I...

581
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:16,319
Just talk to him.

582
00:45:24,964 --> 00:45:27,964
Hey, Raphael.

583
00:45:30,003 --> 00:45:33,003
Hi.

584
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:40,510
I was in the neighbourhood.

585
00:45:42,715 --> 00:45:45,550
So I stopped by to see you.

586
00:45:45,551 --> 00:45:48,551
I wanted to talk to you.

587
00:46:53,953 --> 00:46:56,953
You did a good job.

588
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:05,597
I didn't say anything.

589
00:47:05,598 --> 00:47:08,567
You did a great job.

590
00:47:08,568 --> 00:47:10,235
Yeah?

591
00:47:10,236 --> 00:47:13,236
Yeah.

592
00:47:13,473 --> 00:47:16,473
Thanks.

593
00:47:28,921 --> 00:47:31,921
Bye, man. See you later.

594
00:48:28,748 --> 00:48:30,882
I know, I'm late.

595
00:48:30,883 --> 00:48:32,651
I'm really sorry.

596
00:48:32,652 --> 00:48:35,652
Come on. We'll be late.

597
00:49:57,336 --> 00:50:00,336
We approached Starbuck
before filing the suit

598
00:50:00,973 --> 00:50:03,973
to see if he was willing
to change his mind,

599
00:50:05,244 --> 00:50:08,244
but he categorically refused.

600
00:50:45,017 --> 00:50:48,017
Yes?

601
00:50:54,126 --> 00:50:56,294
Yes?

602
00:50:56,295 --> 00:50:59,295
Thank you.

603
00:51:03,035 --> 00:51:05,837
I just wanted to tell you...

604
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:08,838
well, I don't know
all of you, but...

605
00:51:09,842 --> 00:51:12,842
I love you.

606
00:51:13,012 --> 00:51:15,180
I love you all very much.

607
00:51:15,181 --> 00:51:18,181
You're all focusing a lot
on Starbuck.

608
00:51:18,584 --> 00:51:21,584
But you can't forget that
whatever happens,

609
00:51:22,321 --> 00:51:25,321
you're all brothers and sisters.

610
00:51:26,225 --> 00:51:29,225
You've found one another.

611
00:51:51,283 --> 00:51:53,718
Hey, man! Thanks!

612
00:51:53,719 --> 00:51:55,520
You're right.

613
00:51:55,521 --> 00:51:57,689
Yeah, well, thanks.

614
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:00,689
I always see him in the subway.

615
00:52:03,027 --> 00:52:05,696
What are you doing here?

616
00:52:05,697 --> 00:52:08,697
I'm Raphaels adoptive father.

617
00:52:10,568 --> 00:52:12,269
Raphael?

618
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:15,270
Raphaels disabled.
He's in an institution.

619
00:52:15,874 --> 00:52:18,874
That's why he can't be here tonight.

620
00:52:22,147 --> 00:52:25,147
Julie, this is Marco.

621
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:26,917
It is Marco, right?

622
00:52:26,918 --> 00:52:29,918
Marco saved my life
at the public pool.

623
00:52:30,155 --> 00:52:32,089
He's a lifeguard.

624
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:34,224
I'm Raphaels adoptive father.

625
00:52:34,225 --> 00:52:37,225
He's disabled
and can't be here tonight.

626
00:52:37,762 --> 00:52:40,762
- One of these kids is yours?
- By adoption.

627
00:52:43,101 --> 00:52:46,101
Hey!

628
00:52:48,072 --> 00:52:49,306
What are you...

629
00:52:49,307 --> 00:52:51,308
It's Etienne!

630
00:52:51,309 --> 00:52:54,309
Etienne works at a café
in my neighbourhood,

631
00:52:54,946 --> 00:52:56,346
but he's an actor, too.

632
00:52:56,347 --> 00:52:58,515
This is Marco, a lifeguard.

633
00:52:58,516 --> 00:53:00,350
Julie, an ex-addict.

634
00:53:00,351 --> 00:53:01,685
I adopted Raphael,

635
00:53:01,686 --> 00:53:04,686
a disabled young man
who couldn't be here tonight...

636
00:53:04,789 --> 00:53:07,789
adopted.

637
00:53:19,304 --> 00:53:22,304
David.

638
00:53:24,275 --> 00:53:27,275
David!

639
00:53:29,481 --> 00:53:32,481
What are you doing here?

640
00:53:33,818 --> 00:53:35,986
I spoke to the psychologist.

641
00:53:35,987 --> 00:53:38,889
He said he met you
and you're perfectly normal.

642
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:41,558
- I told you so.
- You're not normal!

643
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:42,693
As of tonight,

644
00:53:42,694 --> 00:53:45,694
you're party to a class-action suit
against yourself!

645
00:53:46,998 --> 00:53:49,998
- What are you doing here?
- Spying.

646
00:53:50,401 --> 00:53:53,401
The only chance we have
is to show that you're not normal.

647
00:53:54,472 --> 00:53:56,406
It's our only chance.

648
00:53:56,407 --> 00:53:57,975
But I am normal.

649
00:53:57,976 --> 00:54:00,577
I've known you 20 years.
You're not normal.

650
00:54:00,578 --> 00:54:03,578
It's time to tell the psychologist
about Mariouka.

651
00:54:04,749 --> 00:54:05,916
Mariouka?

652
00:54:05,917 --> 00:54:08,685
You married a Russian woman
you didn't even know!

653
00:54:08,686 --> 00:54:10,754
She said she'd be my maid
for a year.

654
00:54:10,755 --> 00:54:13,357
And she took off after three days.

655
00:54:13,358 --> 00:54:16,358
How much did you lose in
that scheme to import Cuban cigars?

656
00:54:17,095 --> 00:54:19,429
The guy seemed like
a legit businessman!

657
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:21,732
He walked around in a swimsuit!

658
00:54:21,733 --> 00:54:24,733
Who does business
with a guy in a swimsuit?

659
00:54:25,537 --> 00:54:27,104
Make sure you mention

660
00:54:27,105 --> 00:54:30,105
you once paid $500 for one of
Hall and Oates's guitar picks.

661
00:54:30,275 --> 00:54:33,275
When they die,
it'll be worth a fortune!

662
00:54:33,778 --> 00:54:36,778
That won't be for another 30 years!
Besides, it's Hall and Oates!

663
00:54:37,415 --> 00:54:40,415
They'd do a gig
at a kids' party for $500!

664
00:54:49,594 --> 00:54:51,895
For once, I'm doing the right thing.

665
00:54:51,896 --> 00:54:53,964
You're not doing the right thing.

666
00:54:53,965 --> 00:54:56,965
Stop going to see your children!

667
00:55:55,994 --> 00:55:58,994
Hello, David Wozniak.

668
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:02,130
My name is Antoine.
I'm your biological son.

669
00:56:04,769 --> 00:56:07,037
I don't like being lied to.

670
00:56:07,038 --> 00:56:09,506
Are you going to out me?

671
00:56:09,507 --> 00:56:11,208
Yeah.

672
00:56:11,209 --> 00:56:14,209
Can't this be our little secret?

673
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,880
- What do you do?
- I work in a butcher shop.

674
00:56:20,351 --> 00:56:23,120
I'm a vegetarian.

675
00:56:23,121 --> 00:56:25,122
So, you murder animals.

676
00:56:25,123 --> 00:56:28,123
No, no! I'm just a delivery guy.

677
00:56:28,626 --> 00:56:31,161
I don't kill them.
I just cart them around.

678
00:56:31,162 --> 00:56:34,162
You cart around the carcasses
of murdered animals.

679
00:56:34,666 --> 00:56:36,466
Yeah.

680
00:56:36,467 --> 00:56:39,467
I imagined you as a musician.

681
00:56:39,837 --> 00:56:41,071
Are you into music?

682
00:56:41,072 --> 00:56:43,707
I'm more of a jock.

683
00:56:43,708 --> 00:56:46,708
Like the guys who beat me up
in high school.

684
00:56:46,978 --> 00:56:48,912
You got beat up?

685
00:56:48,913 --> 00:56:51,913
As you can see,
I'm a little different.

686
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:53,984
Different how?

687
00:56:53,985 --> 00:56:56,985
Most people come into this world
out of an act of love.

688
00:56:58,823 --> 00:57:01,158
Most people are conceived in love.

689
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:03,160
But me...

690
00:57:03,161 --> 00:57:06,161
I came into this world
out of an act of self-abuse.

691
00:57:07,699 --> 00:57:10,699
I was conceived in a little cup.

692
00:57:18,409 --> 00:57:21,409
Can I stay here for a while?

693
00:57:21,713 --> 00:57:24,414
Yeah.

694
00:57:24,415 --> 00:57:26,083
Cool.

695
00:57:26,084 --> 00:57:28,251
He's excruciating.

696
00:57:28,252 --> 00:57:31,221
He's excruciating!

697
00:57:31,222 --> 00:57:33,790
He's already called me
three times this morning!

698
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:35,392
Three times in one morning!

699
00:57:35,393 --> 00:57:37,894
Do whatever he says.
He can't turn you in.

700
00:57:37,895 --> 00:57:40,895
The conversations are endless,
like a police interrogation.

701
00:57:42,767 --> 00:57:45,767
Don't upset him.
Go along with anything he wants.

702
00:57:48,306 --> 00:57:49,406
No.

703
00:57:49,407 --> 00:57:50,440
- Answer.
- No!

704
00:57:50,441 --> 00:57:51,908
- Answer it now.
- No.

705
00:57:51,909 --> 00:57:54,909
No!

706
00:57:57,415 --> 00:57:58,582
Antoine!

707
00:57:58,583 --> 00:58:01,583
Go along with anything he wants.

708
00:58:01,652 --> 00:58:04,652
Yes.

709
00:58:11,462 --> 00:58:14,462
- You look way too relaxed.
- This is a special moment for me.

710
00:58:14,999 --> 00:58:17,999
It's a big step
in our relationship.

711
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:22,670
Nothing they say about me is true,

712
00:58:22,673 --> 00:58:25,673
not a word of it!

713
00:58:27,311 --> 00:58:30,311
They enjoy humiliating me.
They're monsters.

714
00:58:30,615 --> 00:58:32,983
Seriously. They're monsters!

715
00:58:32,984 --> 00:58:35,418
David! Valerie.

716
00:58:35,419 --> 00:58:37,854
Hello. Thank you.

717
00:58:37,855 --> 00:58:40,090
Hello! Welcome!

718
00:58:40,091 --> 00:58:43,091
Thank you. Hi. Valerie.

719
00:58:43,761 --> 00:58:46,761
- Our kids.
- Hi!

720
00:58:46,931 --> 00:58:49,499
- Hello, Valerie.
- Hello.

721
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:52,500
- He's beautiful.
- David!

722
00:58:52,537 --> 00:58:55,305
Dad! Dad, Valerie.

723
00:58:55,306 --> 00:58:56,373
Nice to meet you.

724
00:58:56,374 --> 00:58:59,374
OK, everyone, no stories tonight.

725
00:59:00,044 --> 00:59:02,279
The photo albums
are in the living room.

726
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,280
No, not the photo albums.
No pictures!

727
00:59:05,616 --> 00:59:07,617
No pictures right off the bat!

728
00:59:07,618 --> 00:59:10,618
Come, let's look at the albums.

729
00:59:21,532 --> 00:59:23,366
Sorry to interrupt.

730
00:59:23,367 --> 00:59:25,836
I want to propose a toast
to Valerie,

731
00:59:25,837 --> 00:59:28,837
because it's important
you know that this...

732
00:59:29,473 --> 00:59:30,674
Rite of passage.

733
00:59:30,675 --> 00:59:33,675
This rite of passage
isn't just about humiliating David.

734
00:59:35,379 --> 00:59:37,414
Although that's a highlight.

735
00:59:37,415 --> 00:59:39,983
That's most definitely a highlight,

736
00:59:39,984 --> 00:59:42,219
but it's not the only one.

737
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:44,988
We showed you everything
about David's past

738
00:59:44,989 --> 00:59:47,989
because it's important you know
what you're getting into.

739
00:59:49,894 --> 00:59:51,561
Now that you know all that...

740
00:59:51,562 --> 00:59:52,762
I have more pictures.

741
00:59:52,763 --> 00:59:54,364
We'll see them after dessert.

742
00:59:54,365 --> 00:59:56,233
What pictures?
We've seen them all.

743
00:59:56,234 --> 00:59:57,901
There are no more.

744
00:59:57,902 --> 00:59:59,269
Sniper.

745
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:01,271
Not Sniper!

746
01:00:01,272 --> 01:00:04,040
- What's Sniper?
- David's band.

747
01:00:04,041 --> 01:00:06,710
- No way!
- Yeah, with makeup and everything.

748
01:00:06,711 --> 01:00:08,945
It was the '80s.
Everybody wore makeup!

749
01:00:08,946 --> 01:00:11,581
I didn't wear makeup in the '80s.

750
01:00:11,582 --> 01:00:13,850
I had to explain to Dad
you weren't gay.

751
01:00:13,851 --> 01:00:15,018
What?

752
01:00:15,019 --> 01:00:17,621
You wore tights.

753
01:00:17,622 --> 01:00:19,055
Now that you know all that

754
01:00:19,056 --> 01:00:21,892
and realize the humiliation
isn't over,

755
01:00:21,893 --> 01:00:23,793
you should also know that...

756
01:00:23,794 --> 01:00:26,363
the Wozniaks have had
some wonderful times,

757
01:00:26,364 --> 01:00:29,364
as well as some difficult ones.

758
01:00:29,734 --> 01:00:32,569
- Don't go there.
- Why not?

759
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:35,569
You know it makes me uncomfortable.
It's embarrassing.

760
01:00:36,273 --> 01:00:37,606
What?

761
01:00:37,607 --> 01:00:40,607
Come on. Dad...

762
01:00:43,046 --> 01:00:45,981
When my wife and I got married,
we were very young.

763
01:00:45,982 --> 01:00:48,982
Our dream was to go to Italy
for our honeymoon.

764
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:52,554
But we didn't have much money.

765
01:00:52,555 --> 01:00:54,490
Then came the kids, the business.

766
01:00:54,491 --> 01:00:57,491
We thought: "One day,
when we're old and grey. "

767
01:00:59,396 --> 01:01:02,396
But time passed.

768
01:01:02,732 --> 01:01:05,732
You have to make
the most of the present.

769
01:01:06,403 --> 01:01:08,904
Are you all making the most
of the present?

770
01:01:08,905 --> 01:01:11,905
Yes, Dad, we are.

771
01:01:12,676 --> 01:01:15,577
Good.

772
01:01:15,578 --> 01:01:18,578
My wife got sick.

773
01:01:18,782 --> 01:01:21,782
David showed up
with two tickets to Venice.

774
01:01:22,919 --> 01:01:24,453
He arranged everything:

775
01:01:24,454 --> 01:01:26,922
a hotel near the Doge's Palace,

776
01:01:26,923 --> 01:01:28,590
gondola rides...

777
01:01:28,591 --> 01:01:31,591
And then our three sons
came to join us.

778
01:01:32,595 --> 01:01:35,595
We had supper together...

779
01:01:36,633 --> 01:01:39,633
near the Piazza San Marco.

780
01:01:43,773 --> 01:01:46,773
David paid for everything.

781
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:50,010
He does things like that.

782
01:01:50,547 --> 01:01:53,547
If you can live
with his countless shortcomings...

783
01:01:57,187 --> 01:02:00,187
you're in for plenty
of beautiful surprises as well.

784
01:02:03,393 --> 01:02:06,393
Let's pray.

785
01:02:06,396 --> 01:02:08,397
Just a little prayer!

786
01:02:08,398 --> 01:02:11,398
Let's drink!

787
01:02:12,869 --> 01:02:15,869
How did you pay for
your entire family to go to Venice?

788
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:20,640
I had the money.

789
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:22,978
When you were 20?

790
01:02:22,979 --> 01:02:24,847
Yes.

791
01:02:24,848 --> 01:02:27,848
OK, but where'd you get it?

792
01:02:29,352 --> 01:02:32,352
Can't I have a secret or two?

793
01:02:33,656 --> 01:02:34,990
Sure.

794
01:02:34,991 --> 01:02:37,991
As long as you're not growing pot
or anything.

795
01:02:38,561 --> 01:02:40,362
Very cute.

796
01:02:40,363 --> 01:02:43,363
I wasn't trying to be cute.
It was a threat.

797
01:02:55,111 --> 01:02:58,111
- Have a good game, David.
- Thanks!

798
01:03:06,423 --> 01:03:09,423
You OK?

799
01:03:09,626 --> 01:03:12,626
Yeah.

800
01:03:16,733 --> 01:03:19,733
You wanna play soccer?

801
01:03:20,303 --> 01:03:23,303
Yeah!

802
01:03:29,779 --> 01:03:32,779
Let go.

803
01:03:33,383 --> 01:03:36,383
Now straighten up.

804
01:03:38,121 --> 01:03:41,121
Now that one has to...

805
01:03:41,157 --> 01:03:42,958
Both have to be straight.

806
01:03:42,959 --> 01:03:45,959
I can't do it.

807
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:49,798
Not bad.

808
01:03:49,799 --> 01:03:50,899
Switch.

809
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:53,900
Straight. Make an L.

810
01:03:55,071 --> 01:03:57,473
Switch.

811
01:03:57,474 --> 01:04:00,474
Yeah! All right!

812
01:04:04,247 --> 01:04:07,247
Switch.

813
01:04:22,632 --> 01:04:24,867
Oh, I'm sorry!

814
01:04:24,868 --> 01:04:26,301
I'm sorry, guys!

815
01:04:26,302 --> 01:04:29,171
You won't believe me,
but you were good.

816
01:04:29,172 --> 01:04:32,172
Once you realized
you can't touch the ball with your hand,

817
01:04:32,876 --> 01:04:35,177
you were...

818
01:04:35,178 --> 01:04:38,178
By then, the game
was almost over, but...

819
01:04:38,281 --> 01:04:41,281
I thought for sure your brother
wanted to break my neck.

820
01:04:42,318 --> 01:04:44,620
He wants to break everybody's neck.

821
01:04:44,621 --> 01:04:47,621
You have to come
to the lake this weekend.

822
01:04:48,625 --> 01:04:50,492
I have plans with Valerie.

823
01:04:50,493 --> 01:04:52,127
Everyone's gonna be there!

824
01:04:52,128 --> 01:04:55,128
You're the reason
we thought about doing it.

825
01:04:55,131 --> 01:04:57,533
I understand,
but I have plans with Valerie.

826
01:04:57,534 --> 01:05:00,534
And we've already spent
a lot of time together.

827
01:05:00,904 --> 01:05:03,904
I've got a real family, too.

828
01:05:05,408 --> 01:05:08,310
A real family?

829
01:05:08,311 --> 01:05:10,846
I mean... my family.

830
01:05:10,847 --> 01:05:12,214
OK.

831
01:05:12,215 --> 01:05:15,215
So, the rest of us don't exist?

832
01:05:15,418 --> 01:05:17,986
Maybe you put
that part of your life behind you,

833
01:05:17,987 --> 01:05:20,987
but it doesn't mean
the rest of us just vanished.

834
01:05:21,057 --> 01:05:22,691
We exist.

835
01:05:22,692 --> 01:05:25,160
We're here.

836
01:05:25,161 --> 01:05:28,161
And we're also your real family.

837
01:05:34,904 --> 01:05:36,838
I hope you're happy.

838
01:05:36,839 --> 01:05:39,374
I hope you're very happy.

839
01:05:39,375 --> 01:05:41,677
I hope you really,
truly appreciate this.

840
01:05:41,678 --> 01:05:44,678
Because thanks to you,
I had to lie to Valerie.

841
01:05:45,682 --> 01:05:47,015
Thanks to you,

842
01:05:47,016 --> 01:05:50,016
I had to lie to the woman
who's carrying my baby.

843
01:05:50,553 --> 01:05:53,355
And as far as lying goes...

844
01:05:53,356 --> 01:05:56,356
I'm done.

845
01:05:58,027 --> 01:06:01,027
Did you bring me here
to tell everyone who I am?

846
01:06:01,564 --> 01:06:04,032
No.

847
01:06:04,033 --> 01:06:07,033
I want to keep you for myself.

848
01:07:34,324 --> 01:07:37,324
All right!

849
01:07:38,127 --> 01:07:41,127
Cheese?

850
01:07:53,409 --> 01:07:56,409
This one's a bit heavier.

851
01:08:15,164 --> 01:08:16,665
Right!

852
01:08:16,666 --> 01:08:19,666
How many for tofu?

853
01:08:19,836 --> 01:08:22,104
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

854
01:08:22,105 --> 01:08:24,339
I just want to say...

855
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:26,775
I think it's disgusting,

856
01:08:26,776 --> 01:08:29,776
people who murder tofu for food.

857
01:08:30,113 --> 01:08:33,113
I don't know if you've ever seen
a tofu slaughterhouse,

858
01:08:33,249 --> 01:08:34,349
but it's horrible.

859
01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:36,551
What they do to the tofu
is shocking.

860
01:08:36,552 --> 01:08:39,552
But I'll cook some up
for you anyway.

861
01:08:41,758 --> 01:08:44,426
See what happens
when I put it on the grill?

862
01:08:44,427 --> 01:08:46,762
Exactly what it tastes like...

863
01:08:46,763 --> 01:08:49,763
nothing!

864
01:10:12,547 --> 01:10:15,547
I love my adoptive family.
I adore them.

865
01:10:15,951 --> 01:10:18,951
I'm sure you all feel the same way.

866
01:10:19,154 --> 01:10:22,154
We all love our adoptive families.
There's no doubt.

867
01:10:23,558 --> 01:10:26,558
But this has been
the best weekend of my life.

868
01:10:27,028 --> 01:10:30,028
It would be really unfair

869
01:10:30,232 --> 01:10:33,232
for anyone to miss out
on having a family like this.

870
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:36,504
I don't know.

871
01:10:36,505 --> 01:10:39,505
Don't you think so?

872
01:11:07,602 --> 01:11:10,602
David! Hey, David!

873
01:11:45,607 --> 01:11:48,275
That was a lot of fun.

874
01:11:48,276 --> 01:11:51,276
See you soon.

875
01:12:13,735 --> 01:12:16,735
Raphael!

876
01:12:30,752 --> 01:12:33,752
I just want you to know...

877
01:12:39,928 --> 01:12:42,928
I'm your father.

878
01:12:49,437 --> 01:12:50,704
Go ahead.

879
01:12:50,705 --> 01:12:52,640
Have a great day!

880
01:12:52,641 --> 01:12:55,641
Have a great day, ma'am.

881
01:12:56,211 --> 01:12:58,379
Have a great day, big guy.

882
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:01,380
Careful, your hat.
Have a great day.

883
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:21,301
Coffee? Toast? Eggs?

884
01:13:21,302 --> 01:13:22,569
No, I'm fine.

885
01:13:22,570 --> 01:13:25,239
- Busy weekend?
- Nothing special.

886
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:28,240
I stayed home and read
The Lord of the Rings.

887
01:13:28,877 --> 01:13:31,078
Lie to your girlfriend all you want.

888
01:13:31,079 --> 01:13:33,480
Lying is the basis
of a solid relationship.

889
01:13:33,481 --> 01:13:35,816
But I'm not your girlfriend.

890
01:13:35,817 --> 01:13:38,817
So before you tell me you spent
the weekend with Frodo and Gandalf,

891
01:13:40,188 --> 01:13:43,188
have a good look at this.

892
01:13:47,095 --> 01:13:50,095
THE CHILDREN OF STARBUCK

893
01:13:50,165 --> 01:13:53,165
It's not cutting-edge
investigative journalism,

894
01:13:53,234 --> 01:13:56,234
but The Times and Paris Match
are interested in the story,

895
01:13:57,272 --> 01:14:00,074
which means, by bedtime tonight,

896
01:14:00,075 --> 01:14:03,075
somewhere between
4 and 5 billion people

897
01:14:04,179 --> 01:14:07,179
will be wondering:
"Who the fuck is Starbuck?"

898
01:14:09,718 --> 01:14:12,186
Is this good news?

899
01:14:12,187 --> 01:14:13,754
Is this good for the trial?

900
01:14:13,755 --> 01:14:16,755
Is this a situation
we can turn to our advantage?

901
01:14:18,626 --> 01:14:20,627
- Yes.
- Yes?

902
01:14:20,628 --> 01:14:23,628
Time to get aggressive.
A countersuit.

903
01:14:23,732 --> 01:14:26,467
We're suing the clinic, too.

904
01:14:26,468 --> 01:14:27,534
For what?

905
01:14:27,535 --> 01:14:30,535
Libel. You should hear
what they're saying about Starbuck.

906
01:14:31,239 --> 01:14:33,307
- Like what?
- Awful stuff.

907
01:14:33,308 --> 01:14:34,374
But it's fine!

908
01:14:34,375 --> 01:14:36,877
With the countersuit,
we'll settle your debts.

909
01:14:36,878 --> 01:14:38,479
We'll even make money.

910
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:41,081
We'll get...

911
01:14:41,082 --> 01:14:44,082
a crapload of money!

912
01:14:47,555 --> 01:14:50,457
You want me to sell my children
to pay off my debts.

913
01:14:50,458 --> 01:14:53,458
They're not your children!

914
01:14:57,232 --> 01:14:58,766
I want to come clean.

915
01:14:58,767 --> 01:15:01,468
You can't tell them who you are.

916
01:15:01,469 --> 01:15:02,903
They're my children.

917
01:15:02,904 --> 01:15:05,904
OK.

918
01:15:05,907 --> 01:15:08,907
But first I want you to hear
what people are saying.

919
01:15:09,911 --> 01:15:12,179
I'm telling you this
as your friend.

920
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:15,180
How can one man be so
devoid of humanity that he...

921
01:15:15,183 --> 01:15:17,918
so devoid of humanity

922
01:15:17,919 --> 01:15:20,919
that he can bring
so many children into this world?

923
01:15:22,991 --> 01:15:24,291
You gotta be oblivious.

924
01:15:24,292 --> 01:15:27,292
Yeah, you have to be stupid
or mentally unstable.

925
01:15:27,428 --> 01:15:30,428
I'd like to meet that guy
and ask him a few questions.

926
01:15:34,836 --> 01:15:37,836
WHO IS STARBUCK?

927
01:15:57,058 --> 01:15:59,960
What do you think
about this whole Starbuck thing?

928
01:15:59,961 --> 01:16:02,629
It's horrible.

929
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:03,997
Why's that?

930
01:16:03,998 --> 01:16:06,733
Because it's horrible.
Don't you think so?

931
01:16:06,734 --> 01:16:08,001
I don't know.

932
01:16:08,002 --> 01:16:09,670
What was he thinking?

933
01:16:09,671 --> 01:16:12,671
I'm sure he didn't think his sperm
would be used as much as it was

934
01:16:13,675 --> 01:16:16,675
or that his profile
would become so public.

935
01:16:16,744 --> 01:16:19,379
He's a pervert,
plain and simple.

936
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:20,681
He's not a pervert!

937
01:16:20,682 --> 01:16:22,816
- Yes, he is!
- No, he's not!

938
01:16:22,817 --> 01:16:24,651
After 655 times,

939
01:16:24,652 --> 01:16:27,652
what's the difference
between that and prostitution?

940
01:16:28,223 --> 01:16:29,890
It's not prostitution!

941
01:16:29,891 --> 01:16:32,059
- It's all the same.
- No, it's not!

942
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:35,060
When somebody
pays you to masturbate,

943
01:16:35,496 --> 01:16:36,763
it's prostitution!

944
01:16:36,764 --> 01:16:39,764
- Can I help you?
- Do you have a 533-seat stroller?

945
01:16:40,168 --> 01:16:41,235
- No.
- No!

946
01:16:41,236 --> 01:16:44,236
Because it's not normal
to have 533 children, is it?

947
01:16:44,839 --> 01:16:47,341
Imagine how mortified
those children must be.

948
01:16:47,342 --> 01:16:49,710
It's a national disgrace!

949
01:16:49,711 --> 01:16:52,711
How does this make us look?

950
01:16:54,949 --> 01:16:57,784
For an air-conditioned room
to beat off in,

951
01:16:57,785 --> 01:17:00,621
I'd pay $35 any day.

952
01:17:00,622 --> 01:17:03,622
But them paying me $35?
That's a sweet deal!

953
01:17:04,692 --> 01:17:07,060
Why not? You're gonna do it anyway.

954
01:17:07,061 --> 01:17:09,796
It's like taking money to breathe.

955
01:17:09,797 --> 01:17:12,797
I'm sure that guy
will never come forward.

956
01:17:14,435 --> 01:17:16,870
Imagine being known
as Sergeant Pecker

957
01:17:16,871 --> 01:17:18,605
the rest of your life?

958
01:17:18,606 --> 01:17:19,973
How could you work?

959
01:17:19,974 --> 01:17:22,309
No matter what you'd say
in a meeting,

960
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:25,078
you'd still be Starbuck to everyone.

961
01:17:25,079 --> 01:17:28,079
You could make an awesome pitch,
but they'd still think:

962
01:17:28,416 --> 01:17:31,416
"Hey, it's El Masturbator!"

963
01:17:33,655 --> 01:17:36,655
Anyone ever donate?

964
01:17:40,395 --> 01:17:43,395
David, you must have donated sperm
at one time or another.

965
01:17:45,832 --> 01:17:48,832
No.

966
01:17:48,902 --> 01:17:51,902
What about when you lived
next to the LaFrance Clinic.

967
01:17:53,073 --> 01:17:54,407
No.

968
01:17:54,408 --> 01:17:57,408
When you were a kid,
you were always jerking off.

969
01:17:57,945 --> 01:18:00,346
Cut it out, dammit!

970
01:18:00,347 --> 01:18:01,781
I said cut it out!

971
01:18:01,782 --> 01:18:04,782
Can't you shut your mouth for once?

972
01:18:05,085 --> 01:18:08,085
Take it easy.

973
01:18:21,301 --> 01:18:24,136
David...

974
01:18:24,137 --> 01:18:27,137
your brothers want a word with you
in the office.

975
01:18:47,027 --> 01:18:50,027
Some thugs showed up at Dad's.

976
01:18:51,498 --> 01:18:54,498
They threw him in the bathtub.

977
01:18:55,902 --> 01:18:58,902
They want their $80,000.

978
01:19:00,741 --> 01:19:03,741
- I went to all the banks.
- Find the money.

979
01:19:15,188 --> 01:19:18,188
We're filing the countersuit.

980
01:19:18,358 --> 01:19:20,593
Excellent.

981
01:19:20,594 --> 01:19:23,594
I've got everything.
It's all ready.

982
01:20:03,703 --> 01:20:06,703
GOOD LUCK, DAD

983
01:21:11,138 --> 01:21:14,138
A SPOKESMAN
FOR THE CHILDREN OF STARBUCK

984
01:21:15,142 --> 01:21:18,142
David.

985
01:21:51,745 --> 01:21:54,745
All rise.

986
01:21:58,852 --> 01:22:01,852
We shall take the matter
under advisement.

987
01:22:01,855 --> 01:22:04,855
Court is adjourned.

988
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,101
Why are they taking so long?

989
01:22:49,102 --> 01:22:51,303
I don't know, David.

990
01:22:51,304 --> 01:22:54,304
- What don't you know?
- Nothing, OK?

991
01:22:54,407 --> 01:22:57,407
I don't know anything!
Absolutely nothing!

992
01:22:59,779 --> 01:23:01,046
My mother was right.

993
01:23:01,047 --> 01:23:04,047
I'm worthless.
I'm out of my league, David!

994
01:23:04,484 --> 01:23:07,484
You should've hired a real lawyer!

995
01:23:17,631 --> 01:23:20,631
Yes!

996
01:23:21,501 --> 01:23:24,501
Yes.

997
01:23:28,008 --> 01:23:31,008
Yes, all right.

998
01:23:32,812 --> 01:23:35,812
The ruling's in.

999
01:23:36,983 --> 01:23:39,983
Please be seated.

1000
01:23:47,427 --> 01:23:50,427
Both parties will receive
a detailed written account

1001
01:23:50,964 --> 01:23:53,666
in which you will be able to read

1002
01:23:53,667 --> 01:23:55,768
that Starbuck...

1003
01:23:55,769 --> 01:23:58,769
is wholly and unequivocally

1004
01:23:59,372 --> 01:24:02,372
entitled to his anonymity.

1005
01:24:02,976 --> 01:24:05,976
He is also entitled to receive
the compensation claimed

1006
01:24:06,179 --> 01:24:08,280
from the LaFrance Clinic

1007
01:24:08,281 --> 01:24:11,281
for damages and interest.

1008
01:24:14,521 --> 01:24:17,521
Starbuck will be entitled
to keep his identity secret,

1009
01:24:18,458 --> 01:24:21,458
and will receive $200,000
in damages and interest,

1010
01:24:22,562 --> 01:24:25,562
a verdict that will shock many
and disappoint many more.

1011
01:24:26,366 --> 01:24:29,366
I feel for all the children
in the class-action suit,

1012
01:24:29,369 --> 01:24:32,369
but I am extremely proud to have
defended my client's rights.

1013
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:37,240
I'd like to say hello
to my own children and...

1014
01:24:38,078 --> 01:24:40,412
my mother.

1015
01:24:40,413 --> 01:24:42,881
I won, Mom.

1016
01:24:42,882 --> 01:24:45,217
I won.

1017
01:24:45,218 --> 01:24:46,652
I got an A+!

1018
01:24:46,653 --> 01:24:49,653
I also wanna say...

1019
01:24:51,057 --> 01:24:53,025
well... we did it, David!

1020
01:24:53,026 --> 01:24:54,193
No...

1021
01:24:54,194 --> 01:24:56,328
We did it!

1022
01:24:56,329 --> 01:24:59,264
No! Shut up! No!

1023
01:24:59,265 --> 01:25:02,265
Who's David?

1024
01:25:05,372 --> 01:25:08,207
David is my lover.

1025
01:25:08,208 --> 01:25:10,743
He supported me.

1026
01:25:10,744 --> 01:25:13,744
Thank you, my darling David.

1027
01:25:14,748 --> 01:25:17,716
I love you.

1028
01:25:17,717 --> 01:25:19,451
I love you, David.

1029
01:25:19,452 --> 01:25:22,452
Are you disappointed,
or did you expect this verdict?

1030
01:25:25,392 --> 01:25:28,392
Obviously, we're disappointed.

1031
01:25:28,895 --> 01:25:31,597
But it's not all bad.

1032
01:25:31,598 --> 01:25:34,400
What we found out today...

1033
01:25:34,401 --> 01:25:37,401
is that the law does not require
Starbuck to come forward.

1034
01:25:39,038 --> 01:25:42,038
But there's more to this
than the law.

1035
01:25:42,475 --> 01:25:45,475
There's us. And there's him.

1036
01:25:47,614 --> 01:25:50,614
Beyond the law,
there are human beings.

1037
01:25:51,217 --> 01:25:54,052
Ultimately, the choice is his.

1038
01:25:54,053 --> 01:25:56,488
He can stay in hiding.

1039
01:25:56,489 --> 01:25:59,391
But now that he's seen us,

1040
01:25:59,392 --> 01:26:02,392
he could decide to reveal his identity
on his own.

1041
01:26:03,496 --> 01:26:06,496
There's been a massive
anti-Starbuck backlash in the media.

1042
01:26:08,001 --> 01:26:11,001
We want our father to know...

1043
01:26:11,237 --> 01:26:14,139
we don't see him as a pervert.

1044
01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:17,140
We see him as someone
who gave happiness and life...

1045
01:26:18,945 --> 01:26:21,944
to people who really needed it.

1046
01:26:23,015 --> 01:26:26,015
Thank you.

1047
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:50,007
Congratulations...

1048
01:26:50,008 --> 01:26:53,008
darling.

1049
01:26:54,346 --> 01:26:57,215
I had it.

1050
01:26:57,216 --> 01:26:59,884
For the first time ever,
I got it all right,

1051
01:26:59,885 --> 01:27:02,885
and I had to go and fuck it up.

1052
01:27:05,624 --> 01:27:08,624
My mother caught it all
on television.

1053
01:27:08,861 --> 01:27:11,696
Was she surprised to find out
you have a male lover?

1054
01:27:11,697 --> 01:27:14,697
No, she said
she always suspected it.

1055
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:17,800
She thinks we make a cute couple.

1056
01:27:18,570 --> 01:27:20,004
What about your kids?

1057
01:27:20,005 --> 01:27:23,005
They think it's cool.

1058
01:27:24,877 --> 01:27:27,877
I wanted to ask you...

1059
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:30,381
incidentally...

1060
01:27:30,382 --> 01:27:33,382
theoretically...

1061
01:27:33,485 --> 01:27:35,219
if I reveal my identity now,

1062
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:38,220
do I lose the money
from the countersuit?

1063
01:27:40,526 --> 01:27:43,227
Theoretically...

1064
01:27:43,228 --> 01:27:46,228
do I lose the money
from the countersuit?

1065
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:50,900
Yes, I think so.

1066
01:27:55,874 --> 01:27:58,874
I was officially trying
to turn my life around.

1067
01:28:04,082 --> 01:28:07,082
It's harder than I thought.

1068
01:28:47,059 --> 01:28:50,059
Dad...

1069
01:28:51,396 --> 01:28:54,396
I'm Starbuck.

1070
01:29:03,008 --> 01:29:06,008
You're "El Masturbator"?

1071
01:29:22,594 --> 01:29:25,129
For once in my life,

1072
01:29:25,130 --> 01:29:28,130
I'd like to make
the right decision.

1073
01:29:31,370 --> 01:29:34,370
I'd like to be a normal person.

1074
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:38,342
What would a normal person do
in this situation?

1075
01:29:38,343 --> 01:29:41,343
A normal person wouldn't be
in this situation.

1076
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:44,880
I know, but let's just say
they were, OK?

1077
01:29:47,953 --> 01:29:50,953
You know what?

1078
01:29:53,191 --> 01:29:55,960
You're probably
one of the few people

1079
01:29:55,961 --> 01:29:58,961
who can cope in a situation
as screwed up as this one.

1080
01:30:05,303 --> 01:30:07,905
Why don't you tell them?

1081
01:30:07,906 --> 01:30:10,906
Because, as you know,
I've got money problems.

1082
01:30:14,379 --> 01:30:17,379
Your debts.

1083
01:30:26,525 --> 01:30:29,525
You know I grew up
in unspeakable poverty.

1084
01:30:30,829 --> 01:30:32,830
I know, Dad.

1085
01:30:32,831 --> 01:30:35,831
When I left Warsaw
to come to Canada,

1086
01:30:36,435 --> 01:30:38,602
my father gave me $10.

1087
01:30:38,603 --> 01:30:40,938
It's all he had.

1088
01:30:40,939 --> 01:30:42,940
I couldn't refuse his help,

1089
01:30:42,941 --> 01:30:45,941
but I promised I'd pay him back
a thousand times over

1090
01:30:46,845 --> 01:30:49,845
when I made my fortune.

1091
01:30:49,915 --> 01:30:51,515
My father died

1092
01:30:51,516 --> 01:30:54,516
while your mother and I
were still penniless.

1093
01:30:57,956 --> 01:31:00,424
I always wondered...

1094
01:31:00,425 --> 01:31:02,760
what was more difficult for him:

1095
01:31:02,761 --> 01:31:05,761
not having given enough
to his children

1096
01:31:06,198 --> 01:31:08,799
or not having been beside them

1097
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,800
during the hard times.

1098
01:31:14,473 --> 01:31:17,473
My greatest achievement in life...

1099
01:31:17,976 --> 01:31:20,976
has been to have you all beside me
every single day.

1100
01:31:22,214 --> 01:31:25,214
That's my greatest achievement.

1101
01:31:26,318 --> 01:31:29,220
So, like my father before me...

1102
01:31:29,221 --> 01:31:32,221
I want to help you.

1103
01:31:32,758 --> 01:31:35,059
Here.

1104
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:37,461
Here's $10.

1105
01:31:37,462 --> 01:31:39,663
Dad...

1106
01:31:39,664 --> 01:31:42,664
It brought me luck.

1107
01:31:42,968 --> 01:31:45,968
So take the $10.

1108
01:31:47,472 --> 01:31:50,472
And take your share
of the butcher shop.

1109
01:31:53,345 --> 01:31:56,345
It's your inheritance.

1110
01:31:59,117 --> 01:32:02,117
In small bills.

1111
01:32:18,003 --> 01:32:21,003
I'm scared I'll be
a disappointment to them.

1112
01:32:21,606 --> 01:32:23,808
Why would you be?

1113
01:32:23,809 --> 01:32:26,809
Because I'm just
a meat-delivery guy.

1114
01:32:29,514 --> 01:32:32,216
And a terrible one at that.

1115
01:32:32,217 --> 01:32:35,217
True, you're terrible
at delivering meat.

1116
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:38,220
It takes you four times longer
than it takes anyone else.

1117
01:32:41,726 --> 01:32:44,726
But wherever you go...

1118
01:32:45,063 --> 01:32:48,063
people love you.

1119
01:32:48,834 --> 01:32:50,901
They'll love you.

1120
01:32:50,902 --> 01:32:53,902
Everyone loves you.
That doesn't worry me one bit.

1121
01:33:12,357 --> 01:33:15,357
MY NAME IS DAVID WOZNIAK.
I AM STARBUCK.

1122
01:33:37,249 --> 01:33:38,616
Heads up!

1123
01:33:38,617 --> 01:33:41,617
We're live in eight, seven, six...

1124
01:33:57,369 --> 01:34:00,369
We'll be right there, sir!

1125
01:34:04,976 --> 01:34:07,976
Valerie!

1126
01:35:11,508 --> 01:35:14,508
Mr. Wozniak?

1127
01:35:15,145 --> 01:35:18,145
There are some people here for you.

1128
01:35:57,921 --> 01:36:00,921
Is he healthy?

1129
01:36:01,425 --> 01:36:02,892
Yes.

1130
01:36:02,893 --> 01:36:05,893
So, can you come in
to work tomorrow?

1131
01:36:53,744 --> 01:36:56,744
This is a bit weird, huh?

1132
01:36:58,749 --> 01:37:01,749
Sorry.

1133
01:37:13,063 --> 01:37:14,797
My name is David.

1134
01:37:14,798 --> 01:37:17,400
David Wozniak.

1135
01:37:17,401 --> 01:37:20,401
And I'm your biological father.

1136
01:37:24,575 --> 01:37:27,575
And you all have
a new little brother.

1137
01:37:27,778 --> 01:37:30,778
He showed up a bit early,
but he's doing very well.

1138
01:37:31,115 --> 01:37:34,115
Can we see him?

1139
01:37:35,953 --> 01:37:38,953
Sure.

1140
01:37:39,189 --> 01:37:42,189
I'll see what I can arrange.

1141
01:38:00,477 --> 01:38:01,844
Valerie.

1142
01:38:01,845 --> 01:38:04,845
He's so small.

1143
01:38:07,050 --> 01:38:10,050
Valerie.

1144
01:38:17,027 --> 01:38:20,027
Will you marry me?

1145
01:38:21,298 --> 01:38:24,298
Don't you wanna see
whether my figure comes back?

1146
01:38:27,638 --> 01:38:30,638
If you stay flabby,
I'll get flabby, too.

1147
01:38:33,877 --> 01:38:36,412
Is this the first time
"flabby" has been used

1148
01:38:36,413 --> 01:38:39,413
in a marriage proposal?

1149
01:39:02,873 --> 01:39:05,873
I'm Starbuck.

1150
01:39:18,922 --> 01:39:20,423
Why?

1151
01:39:20,424 --> 01:39:23,424
Why are you always trying to con me?

1152
01:39:24,695 --> 01:39:26,429
How could you think a proposal

1153
01:39:26,430 --> 01:39:29,430
would make it easier to swallow
the fact you have 533 children?

1154
01:39:31,301 --> 01:39:34,203
Well, you can forget
about this child.

1155
01:39:34,204 --> 01:39:37,204
Let me be clear on two things.

1156
01:39:37,207 --> 01:39:40,207
First, you asked me to change
as quickly as possible,

1157
01:39:41,111 --> 01:39:43,946
and that's exactly what I'm doing.

1158
01:39:43,947 --> 01:39:46,616
I've thought about this a lot.

1159
01:39:46,617 --> 01:39:49,617
I've concluded that nobody
can make that decision for me.

1160
01:39:51,054 --> 01:39:54,054
Not a judge, not my family,
not Paul Arcand, not even you.

1161
01:39:56,493 --> 01:39:59,493
I'll decide whether or not
I'm that child's father.

1162
01:40:01,231 --> 01:40:04,231
My name is David Wozniak,
and I am the father of that child.

1163
01:40:05,669 --> 01:40:07,069
Me.

1164
01:40:07,070 --> 01:40:09,238
You can say or do whatever you want.

1165
01:40:09,239 --> 01:40:12,239
It won't change the fact
that I am that child's father.

1166
01:40:14,645 --> 01:40:17,645
The other fact that won't change
is that I'm Starbuck.

1167
01:40:20,017 --> 01:40:22,351
I know it's freaky.

1168
01:40:22,352 --> 01:40:24,520
Nobody's gone through this before.

1169
01:40:24,521 --> 01:40:27,521
We're like the first astronauts
on the moon.

1170
01:40:27,824 --> 01:40:30,824
But I see...

1171
01:40:31,361 --> 01:40:34,361
infinite possibilities
for happiness...

1172
01:40:35,966 --> 01:40:38,966
and an incredible amount
of free babysitting.

1173
01:40:42,472 --> 01:40:43,539
Second...

1174
01:40:43,540 --> 01:40:45,708
That was a very long point.

1175
01:40:45,709 --> 01:40:48,709
I admit the first point
was a bit on the long side.

1176
01:40:49,012 --> 01:40:51,547
Second...

1177
01:40:51,548 --> 01:40:54,548
the proposal...

1178
01:40:54,851 --> 01:40:57,851
was for real.

1179
01:40:59,156 --> 01:41:00,890
The second point was shorter.

1180
01:41:00,891 --> 01:41:03,891
I think I managed
to be more succinct with that one.

1181
01:41:12,235 --> 01:41:15,235
I've already revealed my identity.

1182
01:41:15,405 --> 01:41:18,405
You did?

1183
01:41:50,207 --> 01:41:53,207
Promise me you'll take me
to Venice someday.

1184
01:43:53,462 --> 01:43:56,462
On behalf of all of your real family,

1185
01:43:56,999 --> 01:43:59,999
thank you.
