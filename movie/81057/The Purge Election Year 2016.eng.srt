1
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,680
My purge playlist.

2
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:43,902
I put a lot of thought
into it, especially this final tune

3
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:47,106
as it will be
the last song you'll ever hear.

4
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:48,606
Tough choice.

5
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:52,149
And then I thought,
George Clinton!

6
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:55,486
The king of interplanetary
funkmanship.

7
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,200
George's psychedelic rock
will leave you feeling funky, obviously.

8
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:05,543
And soulful, which is
the least I can do.

9
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:11,668
Now, we played a lot of purge games
tonight, and we have just one more.

10
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:14,216
It's simple, yet effective.

11
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,511
It's called "mommy's choice."

12
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:23,268
Mommy, which one
of you will survive this year's purge?

13
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,364
No! No!

14
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,486
No!

15
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,673
This is just
one of a dozen protests around our capital

16
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:58,388
after reports emerged
claiming that the new founding fathers

17
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:02,268
had been using the purge
to help their own economic agenda.

18
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:06,439
Here's a recent statement
by incendiary purge detractor Dante bishop.

19
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:10,148
For the past 20 years,
the nffa has taken to legalized murder

20
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,442
to decrease the poor population,

21
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:15,154
which in turn keeps
the government's spending down.

22
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:18,777
Less welfare, less
healthcare, less housing.

23
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,367
Recent polling suggests
that the growing anti-purge sentiment

24
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:26,332
may have a monumental effect
on the upcoming presidential election.

25
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:29,965
Establishment nffa candidate
minister edwidge Owens

26
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:35,012
has been losing ground to wildcard
independent candidate senator Charlie roan.

27
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:40,144
Eighteen years ago, roan was forced to
watch the brutal execution

28
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:42,389
of her entire family on purge night

29
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:46,392
and entered the political arena soon
after with one goal in mind.

30
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,896
To put an end to the annual holiday.

31
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:54,149
I have no doubt
that the soul of our country is at stake.

32
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,533
The purge has to come to an end.

33
00:03:57,613 --> 00:04:02,333
Senator roan is proving to be the
greatest threat to the nffa regime

34
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,287
since they first took
office 25 years ago...

35
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,096
Is the cunt that close?

36
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,932
All polls have her a point behind.

37
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,445
I'm sorry, Caleb, I've done...

38
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,360
No sorrys, minister,
you're doing a great job.

39
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:35,151
Let us put you where you need to be.

40
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:37,987
Thomas.

41
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:43,373
We have our people out there
countering all this anti-nffa bullshit.

42
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,289
What else can we do?

43
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:48,959
We do whatever it fucking takes!

44
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:58,377
I have had it with all
these idealistic pigs.

45
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:04,218
They want the impossible. Everyone to have.

46
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,390
Some cannot have.

47
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:10,188
Not enough to go around.

48
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:21,744
It's time to do something
about all these cocksuckers,

49
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,737
like that rat bishop and the cunt senator

50
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:29,454
trying to dismantle everything we've built.

51
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:33,833
We are going to use this year's purge

52
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:37,207
to do some spring cleaning, gentlemen.

53
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,771
And where will you
be spending purge night, minister?

54
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,900
I will once again be presiding over
my party's midnight purge mass

55
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,269
because I still believe in it.

56
00:05:57,316 --> 00:06:00,146
The midnight purge mass,

57
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:04,655
where our great nffa leaders gather
together and slaughter innocents.

58
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,910
Is murder our new religion?

59
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:06,949
Senator.

60
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,332
Murder is our new religion. That's snappy.

61
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:13,835
No, the midnight purge mass
where nffa leaders gather to celebrate

62
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:17,126
the night that saved this
country from economic ruin.

63
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,251
We have other ways.

64
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:21,425
Now, America is built upon sacrifice.

65
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,798
From the revolution
all the way to world war ii.

66
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:28,302
Our lord god sacrificed his only son...

67
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:30,102
Everybody look alive.

68
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:32,847
Copy. We have eyes on her, boss.

69
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:35,275
That's why
we must sacrifice every year

70
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:38,482
in order to rid ourselves of hatred.

71
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:41,614
Remember what I said.
She moves, we move.

72
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:48,284
Now, the stats are undeniable.
There has been far less crime...

73
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,375
This is crap.
Do I have to listen to this?

74
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:51,471
Send me to the principal's office.

75
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:52,835
I can't listen to this anymore.

76
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,682
Okay, we'll send you to
the principal's office

77
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,226
'cause you can't keep your mouth shut.

78
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,881
More low-income people are killed

79
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:01,171
during the purge than anyone else.

80
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,483
The money generated from the purge

81
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:06,587
lines the pockets of the nra
and insurance companies.

82
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:07,837
Don't listen to her!

83
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,218
Any government system
that relies on violence

84
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,595
to answer its problems

85
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:12,682
must be rebooted.

86
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,226
She's doing good, Leo.

87
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:20,727
It is time to call upon the
better angels of our nature.

88
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,700
He is going to keep lying.

89
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,240
Jesus Christ. There she goes again.

90
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,284
- Secure the audience.
- I'm on it.

91
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,868
I'd like to talk to you guys.

92
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:37,502
Put a leash on her, chief.
She's no good to anyone dead.

93
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:38,671
You got it, Leo.

94
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,384
- Okay. We're on the move.
- Copy, boss.

95
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:46,968
Thank you very much.
Thank you so much. Thank you.

96
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,550
Go sit down. I'm happy to stay here
for the rest of the night.

97
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,466
Stay close to her. Keep it tight.

98
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,519
Go out. Purge and purify. Purge and purify!

99
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,097
Hi. Thank you again.

100
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:03,567
As she's done many times before,

101
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,899
senator roan broke security protocol,

102
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,881
walking off the stage,
stepping into the audience.

103
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:10,245
Tell you this much, she
got 'em little titties,

104
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,744
but she got some big-ass balls.

105
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,906
She ain't got a snowball's chance

106
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,585
in a steam bath of winning this thing,

107
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:18,422
but she be taking on them ol' white-haired

108
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:20,127
George Washington wannabe mofos

109
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:21,209
all by herself.

110
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,288
And to that, I say bully for her.

111
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,668
Oh, horseshit. She's full of it too.

112
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:27,336
Nothing'll ever change.

113
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,724
Hey, Laney. Laney, Laney?

114
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,719
I think we've offended
Marcos with our anti-senator talk.

115
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,933
The senator's going to win.

116
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,773
She's gonna make real changes too.
You'll see.

117
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,389
All she needs is Florida.

118
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:44,190
She gets the 29 electoral votes from
Florida, that puts her over 270.

119
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,150
- She can do it.
- Smartass.

120
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,736
All that useless shit
and can't butter a damn bagel correctly.

121
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:52,571
I could butter your bagel, boss.

122
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:55,094
- Oh, you'd butter my bagel?
- Mmm...

123
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,118
Well, you got jokes over there.

124
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,182
Yeah, you just be careful, kid,
with all that hope,

125
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,616
'cause it can be a bad thing.

126
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,956
Hope can lead to a lot of letdown.

127
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,253
Tell him, Irish I.

128
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,465
Excuse me, what?

129
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:08,474
I'm not paying attention.

130
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:11,341
I'm thinking about waffles and pussy.

131
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,466
That's all I ever really
think about, actually.

132
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:15,272
- Mmm-mmm...
- Irish I, ladies and gentlemen.

133
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:19,273
The fuck you laughing at? I'm dead serious.

134
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,309
Ah, fuck!

135
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:30,239
The new founding fathers
believe in fairness.

136
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,840
And we hear what
the people are saying.

137
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:35,492
That the purge benefits
the rich and the powerful.

138
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:36,994
That was never the intention.

139
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:41,084
From this point on, no one is exempt.

140
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,788
The rules protecting level 10 government
officials have been revoked.

141
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,962
Yeah. Come in.

142
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,174
You seeing this?

143
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,135
Yeah, nffa is revoking the purge rule

144
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:51,234
that protects government officials

145
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,128
of ranking 10 on purge night.

146
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:56,007
Yeah, I'll secure a safe house
and full security detail on the night.

147
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,346
No. I'm staying home on purge night.

148
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,350
Senator, I don't think that's a good idea.

149
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,142
If the voters get wind that I'm hiding

150
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:04,186
in a fortress like some rich asshole,

151
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,151
I lose votes and the nffa wins.

152
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,230
I stay home like 99% of the population.

153
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:12,652
Make it safe. Whatever it takes.

154
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:16,414
Right.

155
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,167
Half price on all masks.

156
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,842
Come on inside.

157
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:40,721
The purge is Halloween for adults!

158
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:48,109
Hordes of young adults are arriving from
Spain, Denmark, South Africa.

159
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,980
They're being called murder tourists

160
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,777
as they are here for one reason.

161
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,940
To purge.

162
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:55,165
We're here to experience the purge.

163
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:57,949
To kill. Release all the anger and hate.

164
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:00,873
To be like Americans. We're very excited.

165
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:07,425
Foreigners coming to our capital to kill.

166
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,751
Murder tourism. It's the new booming
business in our country this year.

167
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,759
Murder tourism.

168
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,086
What's happened to our country, Joe?

169
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,259
Mrs. sabian, I wish I knew.

170
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,595
But you take care of yourself, Mrs. s.

171
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,408
Next time you need something,
just give us a call.

172
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:25,142
I'll have Marcos
run it over and save you the trip, okay?

173
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,685
I come by to flirt with you, Joe!

174
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:29,115
What?

175
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,266
No one's
gonna take that from me.

176
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,358
Ah, you better get out
of here. Get on out of here.

177
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:35,778
Yeah!

178
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:37,201
Oh. Get out of here.

179
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,281
Now she nasty.

180
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,406
She... that's a nasty woman, right there.

181
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,259
Joe. Mira.

182
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:02,928
Son of a bitch!

183
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:09,403
Where's he going?
I never saw him move so damn fast.

184
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,919
All right, girls, give it up.
I won't have to call the police.

185
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,729
Get outta my face, old man!

186
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:19,664
Let's not do this the hard way, okay?
I'm giving you an out.

187
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,660
All right, give up the candy
or I'll have to take it away from you.

188
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:29,295
You touch me and I scream "rape,"
you cocksucking pig.

189
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,245
Now walk away.

190
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:32,345
Give it back.

191
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:37,336
Who are you, bitch?
Better get out of my way!

192
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,514
That's Laney rucker, Kimmy.

193
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:43,264
Laney rucker?

194
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,265
Holy shit.

195
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,274
Og queen badass?

196
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:53,305
Yo! They called you pequeña muerte.

197
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:54,937
Little death.

198
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,197
Yo, you're my motherfucking hero.

199
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,320
That makes me proud.

200
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:04,331
Now give back whatever you stole.

201
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,411
And apologize.

202
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:10,331
Oh, my god.

203
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:17,172
Sorry, mister. I was just playin'.

204
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:24,102
So, Ms. rucker, what happened to you?

205
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,930
You look all whitish now.

206
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:34,904
Later, Ms. rucker.
Wish I met you back in the day.

207
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:39,815
Excuse me.

208
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:49,579
Well...

209
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:53,922
You were a lot more respectful
back when you were shoplifting here.

210
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:55,836
You know, I distinctly remember one time,

211
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:56,959
you called me "sir."

212
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,375
Oh, bullshit.

213
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,590
But listen, I just want to say thank you.

214
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:04,466
You're my family, Joe.

215
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:08,466
I appreciate that. Thank you, Laney.

216
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,693
I want men in there.

217
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:20,494
I want men in there.
I want a lot of men back there.

218
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:23,359
She's got some security,
but I'm revamping the entire thing.

219
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:25,027
We got new barricades on all the doors,

220
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:26,775
all the windows back and front.

221
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,027
Looks safe.

222
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:29,679
Chief, if you tell me
it's safe one more time,

223
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,203
I'm gonna throw you down the steps.

224
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,828
Please don't do that.

225
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,958
Men here. Men here.

226
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:39,172
We got a security monitor system
in this room.

227
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:41,344
We got eyes and ears on everything.

228
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:44,684
This is her safe room.
She is not to leave her safe room.

229
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,680
No one is to go inside her safe room.
Do we understand each other?

230
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:50,074
This is a mess.
She's not gonna be happy about it.

231
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,451
I don't care if she's happy, chief.

232
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:54,815
And I want to go on record
as saying this is a bad idea.

233
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:55,983
No matter what we do here,

234
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:58,901
this house and this senator
are at risk on purge night.

235
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,732
- You understand me?
- Duly noted.

236
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,861
Let's lock it down.

237
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,864
"Let's lock it down."

238
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:08,582
It's just me and you, pal.

239
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:10,449
Tell me what you want me to do. I'm there.

240
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:12,305
Go downstairs,
make sure they take care of the doors.

241
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:14,159
- Keep an eye on that guy.
- Done.

242
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:22,256
The nffa
has created predatory capitalism

243
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:25,549
where profit-making
is the essence of democracy.

244
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:29,135
We've come to D.C. to make some changes.

245
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:33,555
That was Dante bishop.
Like his predecessor Carmelo Johns...

246
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:34,767
Joe's deli.

247
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:35,995
Dante is suspected of eliminating

248
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,121
wealthy nffa supporters on purge nights.

249
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,145
Excuse me?

250
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:42,783
And many are wondering
why he has come to Washington this year.

251
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,260
Wait, wait. Hold it. Wait a minute.

252
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:46,449
Why are you raising my rates now? Today?

253
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,110
Do you know what today is?

254
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:51,333
Yeah, but look, I...
Yeah... I can't afford that.

255
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:53,292
What do you mean, you're sorry?

256
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,370
Yeah, I'm talking to you.
Let me speak to your... your super...

257
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,325
Son of a... son of a bitch!

258
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,750
Joe?

259
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:03,594
What the hell's going on?

260
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,262
The damn insurance company.

261
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:08,965
They just raised the premium on my
purge coverage. By thousands.

262
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:11,142
The day before the damn purge.

263
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:14,221
If I don't pay it by tomorrow,
i have no purge coverage for this store.

264
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:15,308
They can't do that.

265
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:16,852
Yeah, well, they just did it.

266
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:18,943
Just lock the place down, Joe.

267
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:20,611
Yeah, but that's not enough.

268
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:22,939
If I have no insurance, I am screwed.

269
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:29,242
I'll just have to protect
this place myself.

270
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:31,161
- Are you crazy?
- That's not a good idea, boss.

271
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,552
Look, we love this place, too, Joe.

272
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:34,136
I've been coming here since I was born.

273
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:36,663
But it's just stuff. It can be replaced.

274
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:38,084
You can't be.

275
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:40,463
Yeah, but what about what you do
on purge night, Laney?

276
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:41,542
Huh?

277
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:45,049
Is that not the pot calling
the kettle brown? No?

278
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,420
That's different, Joe, and you know that.

279
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:49,838
I'm protected, and you won't be.

280
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:57,642
This is all I got, guys.
This is my slice of the pie.

281
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:02,687
Man, I cannot, I can't lose this place.

282
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:04,443
I can't lose this place.

283
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:11,105
Hold on, Joe. Let's talk about this.

284
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:42,481
Everything is in place.

285
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:44,522
Team's in position.

286
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:46,857
Ten minutes to lockdown, boss.

287
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:34,285
Hey, mama.

288
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:37,778
You ready?

289
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:39,078
Yeah.

290
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:40,866
Vaya con dios.

291
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:42,656
Okay, let's go.

292
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:53,345
Okay. This is gonna be home
for the next 12 hours.

293
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:55,763
You need anything,
you contact me and me only.

294
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,304
- Clear?
- Clear.

295
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,809
Let's begin.

296
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:26,835
This is not a test.

297
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:29,497
This is your emergency broadcast system

298
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:32,126
announcing the commencement
of the annual purge

299
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:34,174
sanctioned by the U.S. government.

300
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:38,765
Commencing at the siren,
any and all crime, including murder,

301
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:41,426
will be legal for 12 continuous hours.

302
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:42,815
Here we go.

303
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,689
Police, fire and emergency medical services

304
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,610
will be unavailable until
tomorrow morning at 7 A.M.

305
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:53,743
And, for the first time
since its inception,

306
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:57,697
no one has been granted
special immunity from the purge.

307
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:00,576
No citizen or group will be exempt.

308
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:06,084
Blessed be our new founding fathers,
and America, a nation reborn.

309
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,250
May god be with you all.

310
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:43,238
I see you, Bobby.

311
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:45,332
You know
you can relax now, right?

312
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:47,502
No, I'll relax in the morning.

313
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,628
Am I interrupting?

314
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:54,134
Senator, you should be in the den.

315
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:57,567
Eric, thank you for being here tonight.

316
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:58,681
My pleasure.

317
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:00,177
Leo, have a drink with me.

318
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:05,517
You don't have a choice.

319
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,480
Sounds serious.

320
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:10,189
Don't say a word.

321
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,690
Or I'll stick my foot up your ass.

322
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,530
Sit.

323
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,750
It's water, Leo.

324
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:37,881
Are you scared?

325
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:41,835
I'm terrified.

326
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:49,555
What made you apply for this position?

327
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:52,231
I like your politics.

328
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:55,322
No. No bullshit. I want a real answer.

329
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:04,702
I lost my son some years ago.

330
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:06,695
He was killed.

331
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:11,307
I almost did something on purge night
that would've destroyed a lot of lives.

332
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:12,871
I want this night gone.

333
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:16,173
I know you do, too.

334
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,920
Especially after what you lost.

335
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:22,975
Yeah. Despite all of that,

336
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:26,262
you have a big problem
with how I do things.

337
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:28,805
You take risks, senator.

338
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:32,271
My job is to eliminate risks
and keep you alive.

339
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:34,403
You don't make that easy.

340
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:38,317
The soul of this country
is at stake, Leo.

341
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,410
The only way that I can win is to risk
everything, and that includes my life.

342
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,710
Peace, not purge!

343
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:03,264
You go, girls!

344
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,180
Have a drink on us!

345
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,970
Can't you see we're working?

346
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:12,309
Purge, motherfuckers!

347
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:17,154
Just gonna wait right here
and see what happens.

348
00:23:17,773 --> 00:23:19,153
Purge!

349
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:22,606
They probably won't bother us, okay?

350
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:28,949
Purge. Purge. Purge.

351
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:32,952
Go, go, go! Let's move!

352
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:02,567
Help! Help! Please!

353
00:24:05,821 --> 00:24:08,991
Somebody help! Help! Help!

354
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,830
Please! Please!

355
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,590
Stop! Stop! Please, stop!

356
00:24:27,676 --> 00:24:28,966
Please, help him!

357
00:24:29,553 --> 00:24:32,723
Something's going down.
Hey, looks like someone needs our services.

358
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:34,886
Let's go.
Let's do this. Stop.

359
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:38,604
I shot my husband!
I shot him. Oh, god!

360
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:40,767
Okay. Calm down.
Tell me what happened.

361
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,240
Oh, no! It was a mistake! I'm sorry!

362
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:06,211
Hey, boss! It's me! It's me.

363
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:07,763
Come on outta there, boy.

364
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:12,467
Good lord, son.

365
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:15,854
It's purge night.
You don't sneak up on black people.

366
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:19,314
Good night, blue cheese.

367
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,650
Where the hell you going?
And why you carrying a chair?

368
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:24,356
I like sitting.

369
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:26,566
Yeah, well, you ain't gonna be staying.

370
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:30,527
Look, you know I appreciate you coming
out here to watch my back, but I'm good.

371
00:25:30,614 --> 00:25:31,784
- I got this.
- No.

372
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:35,332
I'll stay. Nothing else to do.

373
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,450
Look, please don't be a pain in the ass.

374
00:25:37,538 --> 00:25:39,208
I want you to go home and be safe.

375
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:43,084
I don't want you out here
on purge night, son. I got this!

376
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:32,335
Purge night, bitch! It's purge night,
bitch! It's purge night, bitch!

377
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:37,262
Give me that shit. Let's go!

378
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:41,808
Fuck you!

379
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:15,968
Ooh!

380
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:20,471
Happy purge, you old fuck!

381
00:27:22,184 --> 00:27:24,394
You better find someplace else to go!

382
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:28,056
I got a wicked sweet tooth tonight.

383
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:30,028
And I want my candy bar.

384
00:27:30,776 --> 00:27:32,026
And I'm gonna take it.

385
00:27:32,778 --> 00:27:35,068
You don't got the balls
to stop me.

386
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:38,324
Fuck!

387
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:40,736
I have the balls.

388
00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:42,333
Now go.

389
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:49,749
I already took care
of my mom and dad tonight.

390
00:27:49,837 --> 00:27:51,167
You're next.

391
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:54,088
I want my candy bar, cocksucker.

392
00:27:55,843 --> 00:27:56,843
Come on!

393
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:20,622
So, what's up with that?

394
00:28:21,702 --> 00:28:24,542
Every day in juárez was like the purge.

395
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:26,578
I know how to shoot, boss.

396
00:28:30,002 --> 00:28:32,672
Son, I really wish you'd stayed home.

397
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:54,823
- I don't know.
- It's that time.

398
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:22,678
Eric.

399
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,000
What are you still doing up here?
You're on first floor duty.

400
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:35,234
How was your chat?

401
00:29:36,193 --> 00:29:38,323
Enlightening. Go.

402
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:42,316
Chief, find a bedroom. I got it from here.

403
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:43,873
All right, Leo.

404
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:35,924
Boys. Why don't you take a break?

405
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:39,006
Go watch some TV, huh?
It's gonna be a long night.

406
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:40,089
Yes, sir.

407
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:18,627
I'm coming outside, boys.

408
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:59,134
How ya doing out there, Bobby?

409
00:32:05,843 --> 00:32:07,513
Sniper one, radio check.

410
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:14,023
Bobby, radio check.

411
00:32:15,686 --> 00:32:17,056
Sniper two, radio check.

412
00:32:17,145 --> 00:32:18,475
Sniper two.

413
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:45,876
Someone is coming for you.

414
00:32:46,383 --> 00:32:47,883
- What?
- Put that on.

415
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:50,048
- Leo, the house is surrounded...
- Move, move!

416
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:51,217
I'm moving. What are you...

417
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,470
You said you had men on the roof.
You have snipers.

418
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:56,244
- Not anymore. Not anymore.
- What do you mean, not anymore?

419
00:32:56,268 --> 00:32:57,478
- Someone betrayed us.
- What?

420
00:32:57,561 --> 00:32:59,561
I can't trust anyone. Put on that vest.

421
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:06,071
Listen to me! This isn't a drill.

422
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:08,573
Someone's coming to kill you.
You understand me?

423
00:33:08,614 --> 00:33:09,744
Move.

424
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:11,203
Moving.

425
00:33:12,242 --> 00:33:13,242
- What the...
- Go!

426
00:33:13,285 --> 00:33:14,387
Okay, what the hell is that?

427
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:15,661
That's my little secret. Move.

428
00:33:15,746 --> 00:33:17,996
One, two, three!

429
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:20,082
Okay.

430
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:37,269
Boss! It's just me!

431
00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:40,978
Fuck.

432
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,530
- Where the hell is she?
- Jesus Christ.

433
00:34:15,472 --> 00:34:16,852
What the fuck is this?

434
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:34,277
I don't know what the fuck that is.

435
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:49,785
Our mark may be outside. Repeat.

436
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,010
Your mark may be outside.

437
00:34:52,176 --> 00:34:53,756
Check your perimeters.

438
00:35:03,854 --> 00:35:05,864
No payment unless we find her.

439
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:10,943
Fuck.

440
00:35:11,028 --> 00:35:12,148
I see her!

441
00:35:40,057 --> 00:35:41,057
Down!

442
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,400
Come here.

443
00:35:54,071 --> 00:35:55,821
Move. Go! Go! Go! Go!

444
00:36:11,922 --> 00:36:13,172
Hey, Joe, you up there?

445
00:36:13,257 --> 00:36:14,297
Is that Laney?

446
00:36:16,844 --> 00:36:18,014
Marcos!

447
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:21,216
My guys! How you all doing tonight?

448
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:23,265
We're good. You?

449
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,390
Ah...

450
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:26,694
I just dropped someone off at triage.

451
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:31,645
His wife shot him because she couldn't
stand looking at his face anymore.

452
00:36:32,317 --> 00:36:37,067
She said purging didn't make her feel
any better like they said it would.

453
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:39,281
Just stay safe, Lane.

454
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:43,793
Anything happens, do not
hesitate to call us.

455
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:46,254
Yeah, same goes for you.

456
00:36:46,623 --> 00:36:47,963
- Okay?
- All right.

457
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:49,335
All right.

458
00:36:59,303 --> 00:37:01,813
God, I hate that she's out there like that.

459
00:37:03,724 --> 00:37:06,234
Help me! Help me!

460
00:37:08,645 --> 00:37:10,355
Stop. Stop!

461
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:17,992
What was that?
Some kind of homegrown militia?

462
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,620
Those were skilled mercs
with a lot of money behind them.

463
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:22,177
Enough to get to someone on our staff.

464
00:37:22,326 --> 00:37:23,553
I'm guessing it's the minister.

465
00:37:23,577 --> 00:37:25,907
The minister, the nffa,
the whole fucking lot of them.

466
00:37:25,996 --> 00:37:27,406
I'm getting too close.

467
00:37:37,508 --> 00:37:39,718
It's a lot of blood, Leo.
We should call someone.

468
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,850
I don't know who to trust.
We are on our own. You understand me?

469
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,600
Okay. Where do we go?

470
00:37:46,683 --> 00:37:49,853
East. Out of the city. There
are a lot of threats.

471
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:52,484
There's a lot of death.

472
00:38:06,411 --> 00:38:08,371
Purge sanitation services.

473
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:10,709
Death collection haul.

474
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:14,385
Purge victim removal and disposal.

475
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:16,206
Keep Washington clean.

476
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,380
It's okay.

477
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:21,086
Death collection haul.

478
00:38:22,386 --> 00:38:24,386
This is how it's gonna go now.

479
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:28,725
Like you said, fate of
the country's at stake.

480
00:38:28,934 --> 00:38:32,104
Okay? It's my show now.

481
00:38:32,187 --> 00:38:33,807
Look, I'm not an idiot.

482
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:36,607
I know what you're capable of.
I'm the one who hired you.

483
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:39,003
But if I see something I don't like,
I'm not gonna be quiet about it.

484
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:40,147
It's not in my nature.

485
00:38:40,237 --> 00:38:43,817
Senator,
i need you to follow me.

486
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,740
Come on.

487
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:08,814
It's Tommy, sir.

488
00:39:09,016 --> 00:39:10,976
He's in bad shape. He's unconscious.

489
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:13,437
Everyone else up there is dead.

490
00:39:13,478 --> 00:39:16,268
Get him to the ground unit.
Get him stabilized.

491
00:39:16,356 --> 00:39:19,356
Then start street surveillance.
I'll search from above.

492
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:23,777
We need her alive,
so let's find her before the crazies do.

493
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:24,822
Sir.

494
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:36,712
They're tracking us.

495
00:39:37,461 --> 00:39:40,131
Where? I'm not seeing them.
How are they seeing us?

496
00:39:45,636 --> 00:39:46,886
Mercenaries?

497
00:39:47,137 --> 00:39:50,847
No. That's a homemade drone. Purgers.

498
00:39:54,645 --> 00:39:55,655
Now what?

499
00:39:57,314 --> 00:39:59,734
Run. Fast.

500
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:27,546
Come, come, come!

501
00:40:41,692 --> 00:40:45,572
It's behind you, Leo.
Thirty-five yards back, 15 yards up.

502
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:24,567
Down!

503
00:41:52,846 --> 00:41:57,136
Reason I'm so hard on
you, son, like I am is

504
00:41:57,226 --> 00:41:59,686
someday I'd like to make you a partner.

505
00:42:00,604 --> 00:42:05,114
Yep. Oh, boy. Coming here
from another country like you did.

506
00:42:05,984 --> 00:42:07,994
Having your own business.

507
00:42:08,487 --> 00:42:11,107
American dream is still alive.

508
00:42:14,368 --> 00:42:16,038
Whoo-hoo!

509
00:42:48,652 --> 00:42:52,162
We love you, America. America is
the greatest country in the world.

510
00:42:52,197 --> 00:42:53,987
We are gonna kill you.

511
00:43:09,506 --> 00:43:11,336
We will now purge.

512
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,270
We will torture you and violate your flesh.

513
00:43:14,636 --> 00:43:18,056
Remove your skin and share in your blood.

514
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:20,432
This is the American way.

515
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:37,119
Senator.

516
00:43:42,206 --> 00:43:43,616
Come with us.

517
00:44:04,061 --> 00:44:06,061
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

518
00:44:17,741 --> 00:44:19,241
- Stay.
- Yeah.

519
00:44:19,826 --> 00:44:20,826
Yeah.

520
00:44:24,414 --> 00:44:26,174
Well, this is my place.

521
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:28,854
You can stay all night if you want to.

522
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:34,260
Now, I got to ask you
'cause I'm just a nosey old dog.

523
00:44:35,425 --> 00:44:39,425
What in the Mississippi fuck was you doing
outside on purge night, senator?

524
00:44:40,097 --> 00:44:41,347
Yeah.

525
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:45,271
There was an assassination attempt on me.

526
00:44:46,603 --> 00:44:49,983
I can't thank you enough, Mr...
I'm sorry, I know you told me.

527
00:44:50,065 --> 00:44:52,395
- Dixon. You can call me Joe, senator.
- Yeah.

528
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:54,403
Joe, I'm Charlie.

529
00:44:54,444 --> 00:44:55,614
- Charlie.
- Yeah.

530
00:44:55,654 --> 00:44:57,114
That's Marcos right there.

531
00:44:58,115 --> 00:45:00,835
Marcos is... he's a fan of yours.

532
00:45:01,535 --> 00:45:03,165
- Hi, Marcos.
- Hey, senator.

533
00:45:03,245 --> 00:45:05,415
- He actually think you can win this thing.
- Oh, yeah?

534
00:45:06,164 --> 00:45:10,004
Shit! Tell her what she
need to do to win, Marcos.

535
00:45:10,085 --> 00:45:11,495
No, it's not my place to say.

536
00:45:11,587 --> 00:45:15,667
Well, you saved my life,
Marcos. I'd like to hear it, please.

537
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:19,514
Florida is the key.

538
00:45:20,304 --> 00:45:22,224
You have to get the elders.

539
00:45:22,764 --> 00:45:24,184
That's smart.

540
00:45:24,641 --> 00:45:26,481
He's not wrong, Joe. What do you think?

541
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:28,810
I don't think you got a damn chance.

542
00:45:29,313 --> 00:45:30,983
Well, have a little faith.

543
00:45:31,148 --> 00:45:34,398
Well, I lost my faith in the system
a long time ago, senator. Water?

544
00:45:34,985 --> 00:45:35,995
Thank you.

545
00:45:36,028 --> 00:45:40,278
Place is moderately secure.
Cameras. Maybe we stay here.

546
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:43,831
"Maybe we stay here"?
Where you going? You going back out there?

547
00:45:43,869 --> 00:45:47,749
Joe, do you have a first aid kit?
Leo, my security, was shot.

548
00:45:47,831 --> 00:45:49,791
- I'm fine.
- You're not fine.

549
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:51,923
- I'm fine.
- You're not. Sit.

550
00:45:54,922 --> 00:45:56,762
You want me to take it off?

551
00:46:01,512 --> 00:46:02,852
It's okay. It's nothing.

552
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:04,680
Yeah? Doesn't look like nothing.

553
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:08,599
Let me see. Let me see.

554
00:46:08,685 --> 00:46:10,805
I know a little bit about first aid.
I could help you.

555
00:46:15,234 --> 00:46:16,284
The bullet's deep.

556
00:46:16,527 --> 00:46:17,607
- You need stitches.
- Yeah.

557
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:18,734
But we can't do that here.

558
00:46:18,779 --> 00:46:20,909
Right. Clean it up.
Patch it up. Come on. Move.

559
00:46:21,865 --> 00:46:22,865
Okay.

560
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:24,450
Fast. Come on.

561
00:46:27,704 --> 00:46:29,464
What about you guys? Who are you?

562
00:46:29,706 --> 00:46:31,706
- Is this necessary?
- It's very necessary.

563
00:46:31,792 --> 00:46:33,342
You, what's your name? Where you from?

564
00:46:33,377 --> 00:46:34,957
Marcos dali. Mexico City.

565
00:46:35,045 --> 00:46:37,205
But I've been an American citizen
for two years.

566
00:46:37,297 --> 00:46:38,717
You got a record?

567
00:46:38,799 --> 00:46:40,129
Not here.

568
00:46:40,425 --> 00:46:42,425
What did you do in Mexico?

569
00:46:43,887 --> 00:46:45,887
I tried to survive.

570
00:46:46,265 --> 00:46:48,395
What are you doing out on purge night?

571
00:46:48,475 --> 00:46:49,925
Protecting the deli against looters

572
00:46:50,018 --> 00:46:52,308
because my boss
lost his purge insurance yesterday.

573
00:46:52,396 --> 00:46:54,896
Yeah, that's something
you can look into, senator.

574
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:57,110
Insurance companies
screwing the working man.

575
00:46:57,192 --> 00:46:58,572
Yeah?

576
00:46:58,652 --> 00:47:00,532
What's your name, pal?

577
00:47:00,571 --> 00:47:01,965
You know what, Mr. secret service man?

578
00:47:01,989 --> 00:47:03,989
You should be thanking
my black ass for helping you

579
00:47:04,074 --> 00:47:05,584
instead of interrogating me.

580
00:47:05,617 --> 00:47:07,037
His name is Joe Dixon.

581
00:47:07,077 --> 00:47:08,429
- Joe Dixon, have I offended you?
- Yeah.

582
00:47:08,453 --> 00:47:09,556
Yeah, man, just a little bit.

583
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:10,598
Your feelings are not a concern of mine.

584
00:47:10,622 --> 00:47:12,172
Little respect. That's all I need.

585
00:47:12,249 --> 00:47:14,039
Everyone shut up, please!

586
00:47:14,626 --> 00:47:15,916
- What?
- Look.

587
00:47:31,935 --> 00:47:33,895
You stupid motherfucker!

588
00:47:34,021 --> 00:47:36,271
You should have let us take the candy bar!

589
00:47:36,607 --> 00:47:41,277
Now, you're gonna fuckin' pay for it,
you stupid son of a bitch!

590
00:47:41,862 --> 00:47:43,412
Whoo!

591
00:47:43,947 --> 00:47:46,987
It's a good night to purge, isn't it?

592
00:47:48,327 --> 00:47:49,327
Oh, hell!

593
00:47:49,411 --> 00:47:50,661
Who the hell is that?

594
00:47:50,996 --> 00:47:52,307
The looters I was telling you about.

595
00:47:52,331 --> 00:47:54,371
Purge night, senator. What did you expect?

596
00:47:56,627 --> 00:48:00,627
Hey, you old fuck! I'm back.

597
00:48:03,008 --> 00:48:04,718
And I brought some friends.

598
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:06,969
And I'm gonna get that candy bar.

599
00:48:07,012 --> 00:48:08,740
They have chainsaws
and they're coming inside.

600
00:48:08,764 --> 00:48:10,158
All right. I got to get you outta here.

601
00:48:10,182 --> 00:48:11,772
Yeah, but they're at both entrances.

602
00:48:11,808 --> 00:48:14,978
Then I'm gonna purge by killing you
and burning this bitch to the ground!

603
00:48:15,062 --> 00:48:16,732
I gotta call her.

604
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:17,980
Who?

605
00:48:18,023 --> 00:48:20,153
We have a friend out there in a triage Van.

606
00:48:20,484 --> 00:48:22,114
You trust this friend?

607
00:48:22,152 --> 00:48:24,652
Hey, you still questioning my integrity.

608
00:48:24,738 --> 00:48:27,158
Boy, you are a piece of work, man.

609
00:48:29,326 --> 00:48:30,486
Come on, girl, pick up.

610
00:48:30,827 --> 00:48:32,907
Those motherfuckers
blindsided us, man.

611
00:48:32,996 --> 00:48:34,390
- I gotta get back out there.
- No, no, no.

612
00:48:34,414 --> 00:48:37,174
You're not going anywhere.
I told your mom I'd look after you.

613
00:48:37,251 --> 00:48:39,854
Just hurry up. Hurry up and bandage me up
so I can get back out there.

614
00:48:39,878 --> 00:48:41,523
Okay, you promised me
you were gonna stay home tonight.

615
00:48:41,547 --> 00:48:42,837
Well, I want to purge tonight.

616
00:48:42,923 --> 00:48:44,173
- No.
- I want to purge.

617
00:48:44,258 --> 00:48:45,928
Laney, what? Laney!

618
00:48:47,052 --> 00:48:48,142
For real, Laney?

619
00:48:48,178 --> 00:48:49,348
Yeah. For real.

620
00:48:49,388 --> 00:48:51,178
You heard me right. Senator roan.

621
00:48:51,265 --> 00:48:54,065
Call me back, Lane. We need you bad.

622
00:48:55,686 --> 00:48:57,266
She'll call back.

623
00:48:57,354 --> 00:49:00,074
We can't count on your friend.
These kids will be in here soon.

624
00:49:01,942 --> 00:49:03,072
What do we do?

625
00:49:04,653 --> 00:49:05,653
Okay.

626
00:49:05,946 --> 00:49:08,446
We're gonna work as a team
to protect this woman.

627
00:49:08,532 --> 00:49:10,782
You gentlemen understand
what's at stake here, yes?

628
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:13,081
- Yes? All right.
- Yes.

629
00:49:13,537 --> 00:49:16,707
We are gonna purge today

630
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:18,880
purge today, purge today

631
00:49:19,751 --> 00:49:25,631
we are gonna purge today
burn this bitch down

632
00:49:27,968 --> 00:49:29,048
fuck!

633
00:49:29,136 --> 00:49:31,426
Okay, you take the back,
I'm gonna take the front.

634
00:49:31,513 --> 00:49:32,683
I'll take the front with you.

635
00:49:32,723 --> 00:49:34,363
No, you're not gonna be on the frontline.

636
00:49:34,391 --> 00:49:36,561
Are you crazy, Leo? Give me a gun.

637
00:49:36,643 --> 00:49:39,455
I will give you a gun, but you're not
on the frontline. Over my dead body.

638
00:49:39,479 --> 00:49:40,899
Then you better drop dead.

639
00:49:41,273 --> 00:49:43,023
I think he's right, senator.

640
00:49:43,066 --> 00:49:44,276
Thank you, deli man.

641
00:49:44,359 --> 00:49:47,529
Deli man? I agree with you,
you still throwing attitude?

642
00:49:47,571 --> 00:49:50,071
Okay, enough! Executive decision.

643
00:49:50,115 --> 00:49:52,525
I'm with Leo.
We need as many guns as we can get.

644
00:49:59,124 --> 00:50:00,134
Go, go, go!

645
00:50:00,542 --> 00:50:01,582
Move, move, move!

646
00:50:04,963 --> 00:50:05,963
Down.

647
00:50:07,508 --> 00:50:10,588
Just point and shoot. Do not shoot me.

648
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:23,270
If I want some candy,
I'll take some candy!

649
00:50:23,357 --> 00:50:25,777
I'll take whatever the fuck I want!

650
00:50:26,276 --> 00:50:28,446
My mom's not gonna like this!

651
00:50:28,654 --> 00:50:32,204
This is what the purge is all about.
Me getting mine.

652
00:50:32,282 --> 00:50:34,872
You getting yours and
nobody stopping anybody!

653
00:50:35,285 --> 00:50:37,035
Bye-bye, motherfucker!

654
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:40,540
Say goodnight, cocksucker.
Because here comes your candy girl!

655
00:50:46,547 --> 00:50:47,957
Here they come.

656
00:50:58,141 --> 00:50:59,311
Fucking asshole!

657
00:51:12,698 --> 00:51:13,738
Hold on!

658
00:51:32,593 --> 00:51:33,723
Wait here.

659
00:52:08,921 --> 00:52:11,721
Pequeña muerte is back, bitches.

660
00:52:16,386 --> 00:52:18,846
Hey, guys! I got your message.

661
00:52:18,889 --> 00:52:19,889
Laney!

662
00:52:21,892 --> 00:52:24,142
- This is our girl.
- Go, go, go!

663
00:52:29,399 --> 00:52:31,319
Holy shit, it really is you.

664
00:52:31,401 --> 00:52:32,481
- Where do we go?
- The Van.

665
00:52:32,945 --> 00:52:33,955
Go.

666
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:35,821
Come on, Joe.

667
00:52:35,906 --> 00:52:37,906
I'll be with you in a minute.
I'll be there.

668
00:52:43,413 --> 00:52:44,543
Joe, come on.

669
00:52:44,581 --> 00:52:46,831
You get out of here, kid. I'm staying.

670
00:52:47,251 --> 00:52:48,251
They'll kill you.

671
00:52:48,293 --> 00:52:49,463
Go now!

672
00:52:52,005 --> 00:52:53,255
If you stay, I stay.

673
00:52:53,423 --> 00:52:54,673
Just leave.

674
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:56,260
Joe, listen to me.

675
00:52:56,343 --> 00:52:58,571
For some reason,
the senator ended up in our neighborhood,

676
00:52:58,595 --> 00:52:59,925
in your deli.

677
00:53:00,013 --> 00:53:02,433
Maybe it's our duty to help protect her.

678
00:53:02,933 --> 00:53:06,563
We'll rebuild the deli.
Whatever it takes, you and me. I promise.

679
00:53:06,603 --> 00:53:08,483
Come on, guys. Now!

680
00:53:19,616 --> 00:53:21,616
Where we headed?

681
00:53:21,785 --> 00:53:24,075
Underground triage center service
in the community.

682
00:53:24,121 --> 00:53:25,791
It's completely secure.

683
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:46,229
Expand our perimeter.
They're on foot. They can't be far.

684
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:48,650
Earl, spoke with the ground unit.

685
00:53:49,062 --> 00:53:50,982
Tommy regained consciousness.

686
00:53:51,023 --> 00:53:53,483
Says he got a shot off
at the senator's security.

687
00:53:53,525 --> 00:53:55,815
He thinks the bullet
is lodged in his shoulder.

688
00:54:20,344 --> 00:54:22,354
How the hell did it get to this?

689
00:54:32,523 --> 00:54:33,523
Who is he?

690
00:54:34,191 --> 00:54:35,531
Why is he cuffed?

691
00:54:35,609 --> 00:54:40,029
Rondo. Two bullet holes delivered
by a rival gang, but he's a good kid.

692
00:54:40,614 --> 00:54:43,034
He's chained up because
i didn't want him purging anymore.

693
00:54:45,702 --> 00:54:47,912
So, senator...

694
00:54:47,996 --> 00:54:50,206
Nffa made a move on your ass.

695
00:54:50,624 --> 00:54:52,254
Seems that way.

696
00:54:53,085 --> 00:54:58,095
Goddamn conniving, duplicitous,
crooked, cocksucking politicians.

697
00:54:58,715 --> 00:54:59,835
Agreed.

698
00:55:01,385 --> 00:55:02,895
We're not all that bad.

699
00:55:05,055 --> 00:55:06,215
My experience, senator?

700
00:55:06,265 --> 00:55:09,435
My people are on our own,
no matter what you all say or promise.

701
00:55:09,518 --> 00:55:12,648
I'm kinda confused here.
Who the hell is this lady?

702
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:15,481
You big dope!

703
00:55:15,566 --> 00:55:17,896
You give people from the
neighborhood a bad name.

704
00:55:24,575 --> 00:55:26,285
Just some purgers.

705
00:55:27,619 --> 00:55:29,249
That's crossfire.

706
00:55:29,997 --> 00:55:31,497
Not for us.

707
00:55:35,752 --> 00:55:37,672
You seem really close.

708
00:55:38,255 --> 00:55:39,675
How do you know each other?

709
00:55:39,756 --> 00:55:42,756
Joe gave me a job seven years ago
when I first came here from Mexico.

710
00:55:44,303 --> 00:55:46,183
I've been working for him ever since.

711
00:55:46,513 --> 00:55:47,723
And you?

712
00:55:48,473 --> 00:55:50,603
Joe's been looking out for me
since I was a kid.

713
00:55:50,851 --> 00:55:52,771
And he helped me get out of the life.

714
00:55:54,188 --> 00:55:56,438
Sounds like Joe is a Saint.

715
00:55:56,607 --> 00:55:58,567
Yeah, well, I ain't no Saint.

716
00:55:58,901 --> 00:56:00,571
I'm just doing my part.

717
00:56:03,113 --> 00:56:06,833
Riding around in a Van,
on purge night, helping people?

718
00:56:08,118 --> 00:56:09,788
It's pretty dangerous.

719
00:56:09,995 --> 00:56:12,965
Unwritten purge rule is
leave the triage units alone.

720
00:56:13,415 --> 00:56:15,825
It's true, for the most part.

721
00:56:17,002 --> 00:56:20,132
Seriously, Laney,
who the hell are these people?

722
00:56:20,589 --> 00:56:21,669
Do you read?

723
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,010
Down! Everybody down!

724
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:30,681
Anybody hit?

725
00:56:30,766 --> 00:56:31,826
I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

726
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:32,850
- You sure?
- Yes.

727
00:56:32,935 --> 00:56:34,605
- Laney!
- I'm okay.

728
00:56:35,312 --> 00:56:37,152
Oh, Jesus Christ! Rondo is dead.

729
00:56:39,983 --> 00:56:41,283
What the fuck was that?

730
00:56:41,318 --> 00:56:43,318
They found us, senator.

731
00:56:45,822 --> 00:56:48,662
I want you to turn left!
Go under the freeway.

732
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,200
- Move! Move!
- Yes.

733
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:52,159
Tonight,

734
00:56:52,663 --> 00:56:56,213
the gates of hell will
open and invite me in.

735
00:56:57,251 --> 00:57:00,501
It's survival of the fucking fittest.

736
00:57:00,796 --> 00:57:02,546
Who's the fittest?

737
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:05,178
I'm the fittest of them all!

738
00:57:11,348 --> 00:57:14,428
What the fuck?
We're gonna lose them under there.

739
00:57:16,353 --> 00:57:18,693
Ground unit, get your asses moving

740
00:57:18,772 --> 00:57:20,902
and get here now. We got them cornered.

741
00:57:49,052 --> 00:57:50,512
Turn here and stop.

742
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:03,940
Do we just wait here?

743
00:58:04,026 --> 00:58:07,236
No, they'll have units on the ground.
They're gonna be all over us.

744
00:58:07,446 --> 00:58:09,799
We all better figure it out fast
'cause I don't like it here.

745
00:58:09,823 --> 00:58:11,373
It doesn't make any sense.

746
00:58:11,408 --> 00:58:13,636
There was no way they could've known
we'd be in this Van.

747
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:16,000
Doesn't matter. They did.

748
00:58:24,046 --> 00:58:25,256
You son of a bitch.

749
00:58:28,383 --> 00:58:29,473
Leo?

750
00:58:33,096 --> 00:58:34,096
- Leo?
- Move.

751
00:58:36,725 --> 00:58:37,725
Leo.

752
00:58:45,609 --> 00:58:46,989
Oh!

753
00:58:47,986 --> 00:58:49,946
Leo, what the hell are you doing?

754
00:58:57,871 --> 00:58:58,871
Leo, what...

755
00:59:04,253 --> 00:59:07,303
Trace bullet. That's how he found us.

756
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:09,259
Just leave it here and drive away.

757
00:59:09,299 --> 00:59:10,568
They'll never know we left here.

758
00:59:10,592 --> 00:59:14,352
Yeah, well, I wish it were that simple.
You all need to see this.

759
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:22,980
There's a whole bunch of negroes
coming right this way.

760
00:59:23,313 --> 00:59:24,313
And we sitting up here

761
00:59:24,356 --> 00:59:25,916
like a bucket of motherfucking chicken.

762
00:59:38,662 --> 00:59:40,162
What's your eta?

763
00:59:41,206 --> 00:59:42,746
Two minutes, Earl.

764
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,840
Open the door, now!

765
00:59:54,595 --> 00:59:55,765
What are we gonna do?

766
00:59:55,846 --> 00:59:56,906
They'll start
blasting if we move.

767
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:58,350
They'll start blasting if we don't.

768
00:59:59,892 --> 01:00:01,852
Open the door! Open the door, now!

769
01:00:03,187 --> 01:00:05,017
Open the goddamn doors!

770
01:00:05,647 --> 01:00:06,727
What's the plan?

771
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:13,700
Yo, yo, yo! Quiet down! Quiet down!

772
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,320
- What the hell is that?
- Quiet down!

773
01:00:17,826 --> 01:00:19,426
I know what I heard.
I know what I heard.

774
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:24,870
I told you I ain't no Saint.
Everybody's got a past.

775
01:00:24,917 --> 01:00:27,747
That was a crip whistle.
They just threw it back.

776
01:00:27,836 --> 01:00:30,836
If this is the right set,
we should be good.

777
01:00:33,383 --> 01:00:35,183
I know,
i know what I heard. I know.

778
01:00:37,054 --> 01:00:38,224
All right.

779
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:46,309
We're not gonna hurt you.
Just help my fuckin' boy. He's gonna die.

780
01:00:46,897 --> 01:00:48,567
We help you,

781
01:00:49,233 --> 01:00:51,233
you do something for us.

782
01:00:57,241 --> 01:00:59,302
They're still under the overpass,
but they're on the move.

783
01:00:59,326 --> 01:01:01,236
Get your asses in there.

784
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,880
They stopped. Stop the truck.

785
01:01:15,133 --> 01:01:16,633
We're going on foot.

786
01:01:36,238 --> 01:01:37,278
Clear!

787
01:01:51,795 --> 01:01:55,045
Earl, we found the trace bullet,
but no sign of the target.

788
01:01:55,299 --> 01:01:56,879
Yeah, we're heading back.

789
01:02:08,312 --> 01:02:09,982
Ground unit, come in.

790
01:02:11,148 --> 01:02:12,938
Ground unit, come in.

791
01:02:13,567 --> 01:02:14,887
Come in, I need a fuckin' sitrep.

792
01:02:19,448 --> 01:02:21,158
Fuck you, motherfucker!

793
01:02:25,329 --> 01:02:26,789
No one following.

794
01:02:27,414 --> 01:02:28,584
We're clear.

795
01:02:28,874 --> 01:02:30,674
We're a few blocks away.

796
01:02:31,293 --> 01:02:34,673
I'm gonna call in
and tell them we have a special guest.

797
01:02:58,612 --> 01:02:59,702
Where are we?

798
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,450
You'll see.

799
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:22,550
What is this place?

800
01:03:23,053 --> 01:03:24,763
We call this a safe zone.

801
01:03:27,224 --> 01:03:30,194
- Senator, Dante bishop.
- Mr. bishop.

802
01:03:30,227 --> 01:03:31,727
This is angel.

803
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:34,770
Dawn called.
Told me you guys were coming through.

804
01:03:35,774 --> 01:03:38,234
So the nffa came at you tonight?

805
01:03:38,735 --> 01:03:40,895
Can't say I'm surprised.

806
01:03:41,572 --> 01:03:44,322
Let me show you around, get you settled in.

807
01:03:45,742 --> 01:03:47,202
You set all this up, Mr. bishop?

808
01:03:47,244 --> 01:03:48,834
Yes, this is my organization.

809
01:03:49,413 --> 01:03:52,583
We have doctors, and nurses,
emts, paramedics.

810
01:03:53,667 --> 01:03:55,787
This is their way
of protesting this damn night.

811
01:04:01,425 --> 01:04:03,185
How many people
know about this place?

812
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:07,100
Just the volunteers,
and the homeless that we invite in.

813
01:04:08,432 --> 01:04:11,562
Look, these are the real
victims of the purge.

814
01:04:11,602 --> 01:04:14,772
The people that the nffa
are trying to eliminate

815
01:04:14,855 --> 01:04:17,615
so that they don't have to
take care of them anymore.

816
01:04:20,736 --> 01:04:22,736
These men that are armed,

817
01:04:22,779 --> 01:04:25,119
you'll have them
at all the entrances and the rooftop?

818
01:04:25,157 --> 01:04:27,577
Yes. My men will keep you safe.

819
01:04:28,118 --> 01:04:30,328
Or as safe as you can be on purge night.

820
01:04:31,121 --> 01:04:32,461
Appreciate it.

821
01:04:36,251 --> 01:04:37,461
- Mr. bishop.
- Yeah.

822
01:04:38,295 --> 01:04:42,225
Thank you, for all of this. I am impressed.

823
01:04:42,716 --> 01:04:45,756
Well, don't thank me. Thank the volunteers.

824
01:04:46,178 --> 01:04:49,308
Mr. bishop, I've heard stories

825
01:04:50,516 --> 01:04:53,976
of tactics that you employ on purge night.

826
01:04:55,229 --> 01:04:57,649
I can't say that I agree with any of it.

827
01:04:59,399 --> 01:05:00,899
I'll tell you what.

828
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:02,490
You get elected,

829
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:04,860
you stop this night,

830
01:05:05,822 --> 01:05:08,662
and I don't have to do what I do anymore.

831
01:05:09,284 --> 01:05:10,584
Let's go, angel.

832
01:05:12,579 --> 01:05:13,829
Fair enough.

833
01:05:25,008 --> 01:05:26,508
You hold down the fort here.

834
01:05:26,593 --> 01:05:30,643
Keep an eye on her.
And keep her and her people quiet. Okay?

835
01:05:30,681 --> 01:05:32,181
All right, let's go!

836
01:06:08,177 --> 01:06:11,097
I want access to
every surveillance camera in the city.

837
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:14,560
We'll do a grid search
for that fucking triage Van.

838
01:06:14,641 --> 01:06:17,191
It's out there somewhere. Find it.

839
01:06:23,942 --> 01:06:24,942
Yeah.

840
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:28,240
Your crew? Your guys?
They feel like family?

841
01:06:32,117 --> 01:06:33,117
Boss.

842
01:06:34,494 --> 01:06:36,084
We did the right thing.

843
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:39,290
Yeah.

844
01:06:41,251 --> 01:06:43,001
But it's time to go.

845
01:06:43,504 --> 01:06:45,054
Gotta get back to the deli.

846
01:06:45,964 --> 01:06:49,264
What? No. Are you fucking crazy?
We're safe here.

847
01:06:49,343 --> 01:06:51,553
Laney, you know I'll
walk back if I have to.

848
01:06:52,471 --> 01:06:54,471
Fine. I'll drive you.

849
01:06:55,057 --> 01:06:57,977
But if we run into any problems,
we're coming right back here.

850
01:06:58,060 --> 01:06:59,060
Deal.

851
01:07:05,442 --> 01:07:06,942
Really? Can you do that?

852
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,490
We'll see her again, Marcos.

853
01:07:11,156 --> 01:07:12,776
And she's safe here.

854
01:07:13,951 --> 01:07:15,121
Let's hit it.

855
01:07:19,122 --> 01:07:22,172
I don't know, but I bet
it was really cool.

856
01:07:23,126 --> 01:07:24,286
It is, it is.

857
01:07:25,712 --> 01:07:28,512
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

858
01:07:28,882 --> 01:07:29,882
Good.

859
01:07:29,967 --> 01:07:32,297
- I'm gonna go take a look around.
- Okay.

860
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:34,100
Stay here.

861
01:07:35,389 --> 01:07:36,719
Okay, boss.

862
01:09:05,646 --> 01:09:07,356
What are you doing here?

863
01:09:08,148 --> 01:09:10,478
- Hand.
- Why are you here?

864
01:09:20,202 --> 01:09:21,542
What the hell's going on here?

865
01:09:21,578 --> 01:09:23,748
- He was snooping around!
- Hey, hey! Okay, okay, okay.

866
01:09:24,414 --> 01:09:26,714
- Hey! Hey.
- It's all right. It's all right.

867
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:27,920
Red, back up. It's okay.

868
01:09:29,711 --> 01:09:32,421
Just put the gun down, all right?
Everybody's okay.

869
01:09:32,506 --> 01:09:33,586
Back up.

870
01:09:34,174 --> 01:09:35,264
We're okay.

871
01:09:36,718 --> 01:09:38,928
All right? All right?

872
01:09:39,596 --> 01:09:42,096
We're good. It's all good, okay?

873
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:43,810
I'm just getting my weapon.

874
01:09:44,601 --> 01:09:45,941
What's going on?

875
01:09:46,019 --> 01:09:47,269
Just doing my job.

876
01:09:47,354 --> 01:09:49,024
Senator, it's just a misunderstanding.

877
01:09:49,106 --> 01:09:50,936
Why don't we go back outside?

878
01:09:51,358 --> 01:09:52,438
Come on.

879
01:09:56,029 --> 01:09:57,319
Are you seeing this, Leo?

880
01:09:57,406 --> 01:09:58,866
Yes, senator.

881
01:09:59,116 --> 01:10:00,576
Senator, why don't we go outside...

882
01:10:00,617 --> 01:10:01,617
Stop.

883
01:10:04,121 --> 01:10:06,581
Those are the minister's
biggest financial supporters.

884
01:10:07,791 --> 01:10:09,461
The nffa.

885
01:10:11,753 --> 01:10:12,883
Our lady of sorrows.

886
01:10:14,631 --> 01:10:18,471
Is that where the minister
is going to be tonight for the purge mass?

887
01:10:18,552 --> 01:10:20,552
- We believe so.
- You believe...

888
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:24,970
What is all this?

889
01:10:26,018 --> 01:10:28,058
Why do you have all this?

890
01:10:35,152 --> 01:10:37,032
You're gonna assassinate him.

891
01:10:39,907 --> 01:10:42,907
You're gonna assassinate
the minister tonight, aren't you?

892
01:10:47,706 --> 01:10:50,246
You know, somebody's
got to say it out loud.

893
01:10:50,834 --> 01:10:52,424
What in the fuck happened tonight?

894
01:10:52,503 --> 01:10:54,173
Nobody's gonna believe it.

895
01:10:54,213 --> 01:10:55,213
Mmm-hmm.

896
01:10:56,215 --> 01:10:58,935
Irish ike's gonna be like, "bullshit.

897
01:10:59,009 --> 01:11:02,389
- "Now where's my waffles and pussy?"
- "...And pussy?"

898
01:11:05,015 --> 01:11:06,675
He got that one-track mind.

899
01:11:06,725 --> 01:11:08,845
That boy done lost his mind.

900
01:11:08,936 --> 01:11:10,016
Shit.

901
01:11:11,897 --> 01:11:13,437
I hope he's okay tonight.

902
01:11:15,359 --> 01:11:16,359
Yeah.

903
01:11:21,949 --> 01:11:23,619
Hold on, guys. Look.

904
01:11:25,911 --> 01:11:27,751
Those are government trucks.

905
01:11:28,038 --> 01:11:30,538
I saw them on YouTube
from last year's purge.

906
01:11:31,041 --> 01:11:33,381
And they're going
straight back towards the safe zone.

907
01:11:34,461 --> 01:11:38,011
You cannot do this. I need to
win this thing fair and fucking square.

908
01:11:38,048 --> 01:11:41,378
They are not playing fair and fucking
square and neither should we.

909
01:11:41,468 --> 01:11:43,718
This church will be
locked up like fort Knox.

910
01:11:43,804 --> 01:11:45,964
You'll never get through.
You're gonna get slaughtered.

911
01:11:46,181 --> 01:11:48,431
Four churches were built on that site.

912
01:11:48,517 --> 01:11:51,727
The original by your boy
George Washington over 200 years ago.

913
01:11:51,812 --> 01:11:54,692
The man liked to have escape tunnels
attached to all his structures.

914
01:11:54,731 --> 01:11:56,071
They're all over D.C.

915
01:11:56,149 --> 01:11:57,979
The tunnel under the original church

916
01:11:58,068 --> 01:12:00,238
has been closed up since the '50s.

917
01:12:00,279 --> 01:12:01,529
But we reopened it.

918
01:12:01,572 --> 01:12:03,012
We're gonna walk right through there

919
01:12:03,073 --> 01:12:06,083
and into that church
without anybody even knowing it.

920
01:12:06,118 --> 01:12:09,998
The original founding fathers are about to
fuck over the new founding fathers.

921
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,330
Now how you like that for irony?

922
01:12:13,584 --> 01:12:15,594
How do you know where
this mass is gonna be?

923
01:12:15,669 --> 01:12:19,259
Because we do whatever it takes.
We did this for you, senator.

924
01:12:19,339 --> 01:12:22,026
No, it's not for me. Get your boss
on the phone. I need to talk to him.

925
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:24,260
- He's not here.
- Angel, listen to me.

926
01:12:24,344 --> 01:12:25,514
You call him.

927
01:12:25,596 --> 01:12:30,266
You tell him he does this
and the minister becomes a martyr.

928
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:33,520
I cannot have my presidency
built on murder. You see that.

929
01:12:33,604 --> 01:12:36,024
He will not leave this to the voters.

930
01:12:36,106 --> 01:12:38,106
He does not believe in the American system.

931
01:12:38,192 --> 01:12:39,752
Angel, believe in me.
I can make this happen.

932
01:12:39,776 --> 01:12:41,546
We do. That's why we're
trying to pave a way for you

933
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:43,089
to the white house so you can make changes.

934
01:12:43,113 --> 01:12:44,465
You're gonna
cost me the white house.

935
01:12:44,489 --> 01:12:47,119
It's Laney.
She says there's trucks approaching us.

936
01:12:47,159 --> 01:12:48,159
What?

937
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:50,660
Who is that?

938
01:12:52,998 --> 01:12:54,368
Government soldiers.

939
01:12:54,458 --> 01:12:57,838
That's the nffa
eliminating all their enemies this year.

940
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,880
They're here for bishop,
but they will kill you.

941
01:13:00,964 --> 01:13:03,234
- You need to evacuate your people.
- We can't move the injured.

942
01:13:03,258 --> 01:13:06,258
- I need to get her out of here now.
- There's a way out back.

943
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:07,553
Where does it come out?

944
01:13:07,638 --> 01:13:09,348
The alleyway down to third and Thompson.

945
01:13:09,431 --> 01:13:10,911
Third and Thompson.
Give me the phone.

946
01:13:11,558 --> 01:13:14,098
Laney, I need you
at third and Thompson now.

947
01:13:14,144 --> 01:13:15,734
Yeah, we'll meet you there.

948
01:13:21,693 --> 01:13:23,953
So, we're driving
right back into that war zone?

949
01:13:25,155 --> 01:13:26,565
Stupid!

950
01:13:40,546 --> 01:13:41,796
All these people.

951
01:13:41,839 --> 01:13:43,339
We'll protect them.

952
01:13:43,382 --> 01:13:45,342
Please, stop the assassination.

953
01:13:45,384 --> 01:13:47,844
- It's too late. Now go. Stay safe.
- Go!

954
01:13:51,348 --> 01:13:54,178
So what we supposed to be,
like some superheroes or something?

955
01:13:54,226 --> 01:13:55,346
That ain't what I do.

956
01:13:56,854 --> 01:13:58,154
I hate this night!

957
01:14:01,275 --> 01:14:04,285
Ah, shit. Hell with it. Come on. Shit.

958
01:14:05,445 --> 01:14:07,155
Let's do it. Let's go get 'em.

959
01:14:10,325 --> 01:14:12,365
I can't believe we're outside again.

960
01:14:13,328 --> 01:14:14,828
I'm gonna get you through this.

961
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:28,225
My god, it's so close!

962
01:14:29,052 --> 01:14:30,472
At your own risk now!

963
01:14:31,221 --> 01:14:32,851
Are you fucking kidding me?

964
01:14:33,974 --> 01:14:35,104
- Ready?
- Yeah.

965
01:14:35,184 --> 01:14:36,814
- One.
- Go for it!

966
01:14:36,894 --> 01:14:38,194
- Two.
- Try your luck!

967
01:14:38,604 --> 01:14:39,734
Go!

968
01:14:42,649 --> 01:14:43,859
Good luck out there!

969
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:50,660
Let me hear you whisper

970
01:14:50,741 --> 01:14:55,081
that you love me too

971
01:14:57,289 --> 01:15:02,089
keep the love-light glowing
in your eyes so true

972
01:15:02,169 --> 01:15:03,379
let's go, let's go!

973
01:15:03,504 --> 01:15:04,674
Come on, I got you.

974
01:15:08,634 --> 01:15:09,934
- You guys okay?
- Yeah.

975
01:15:09,968 --> 01:15:12,258
Thank you. Again.

976
01:15:12,596 --> 01:15:13,756
Where we headed?

977
01:15:13,805 --> 01:15:15,805
Drive. Out of this city.
Get us out of here.

978
01:15:28,153 --> 01:15:29,153
You okay, senator?

979
01:15:30,697 --> 01:15:33,277
No, Marcos. I'm not.

980
01:15:34,243 --> 01:15:36,293
This night corrupts everyone.

981
01:15:43,669 --> 01:15:45,629
- Senator.
- I can't win like this.

982
01:15:45,712 --> 01:15:47,842
It goes against everything
that I believe in.

983
01:15:47,923 --> 01:15:51,133
We need to focus on one thing right now
and that's survival.

984
01:15:51,176 --> 01:15:53,346
I need to make sure
you get through this night.

985
01:15:54,304 --> 01:15:57,144
I have to stop them from
killing the minister.

986
01:15:57,224 --> 01:15:58,274
What?

987
01:15:58,308 --> 01:16:01,898
If they assassinate him,
he becomes a martyr. We lose.

988
01:16:03,188 --> 01:16:05,648
Yeah. And how do we do that?

989
01:16:05,732 --> 01:16:07,442
I don't know. We have to do something.

990
01:16:07,484 --> 01:16:12,494
Do what? Do what? You're willing
to risk your life to save an assassin...

991
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:38,180
Everybody all right?

992
01:16:39,349 --> 01:16:40,889
Joe, you okay?

993
01:16:41,351 --> 01:16:42,601
I'll be okay.

994
01:16:42,686 --> 01:16:43,936
Leo!

995
01:16:45,272 --> 01:16:46,522
Gun!

996
01:17:08,879 --> 01:17:12,339
I know where they're taking her.
I know why she's still alive.

997
01:17:12,382 --> 01:17:13,432
Where?

998
01:17:13,509 --> 01:17:16,179
You find a safe place to hide
and you stay there.

999
01:17:17,346 --> 01:17:19,176
No. No way.

1000
01:17:19,223 --> 01:17:21,893
Whatever it is you plan on doing,
we're coming with you.

1001
01:17:25,145 --> 01:17:26,265
Let's go.

1002
01:19:00,032 --> 01:19:04,542
May the purge
protect us. Keep us pure.

1003
01:19:04,745 --> 01:19:06,665
Purge and purify.

1004
01:19:07,998 --> 01:19:12,208
May the purge cleanse us.
Keep us pure.

1005
01:19:12,544 --> 01:19:15,304
Purge and purify.

1006
01:19:15,923 --> 01:19:19,973
May the purge cleanse us.
Keep us pure.

1007
01:19:20,636 --> 01:19:23,096
Purge and purify.

1008
01:19:24,264 --> 01:19:26,224
Come on, guys, that's enough.

1009
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:29,600
We're getting paid to deliver the package,
not gift-wrap it.

1010
01:19:30,562 --> 01:19:34,612
Come on, let's go find a place to wait out
the rest of this fucking night, huh.

1011
01:20:38,755 --> 01:20:40,915
As we always do.

1012
01:20:41,425 --> 01:20:44,725
Blessed be the new founding fathers

1013
01:20:44,928 --> 01:20:48,598
for letting us purge and cleanse our souls.

1014
01:20:49,099 --> 01:20:53,099
Blessed be America, a nation reborn.

1015
01:20:57,858 --> 01:20:59,688
Well, it's been a long journey

1016
01:20:59,902 --> 01:21:03,362
to get away from the lies
and the self-deception

1017
01:21:03,947 --> 01:21:09,117
to this place of knowledge
and awareness of who we really are.

1018
01:21:09,953 --> 01:21:13,463
People of flesh, immensely flawed.

1019
01:21:14,333 --> 01:21:16,673
It's hard to see the ugly truth.

1020
01:21:16,752 --> 01:21:20,302
But change can only come from acceptance.

1021
01:21:20,464 --> 01:21:23,934
And change we must, as it is our godly duty

1022
01:21:24,134 --> 01:21:26,804
to get rid of the fury and the hatred

1023
01:21:27,095 --> 01:21:29,465
that poisons our souls, makes us sick.

1024
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,640
Makes us ugly.

1025
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:34,190
Tonight,

1026
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:38,310
we, the leaders of this great country,

1027
01:21:38,649 --> 01:21:43,739
will sin, scour, sanitize
and sterilize our souls

1028
01:21:43,820 --> 01:21:48,740
until we are free again,
and this country will be better for it.

1029
01:21:50,327 --> 01:21:54,037
We are not hypocrites!

1030
01:21:55,666 --> 01:21:58,336
We practice what we preach.

1031
01:22:00,546 --> 01:22:02,876
Purge and purify! Say it with me.

1032
01:22:03,298 --> 01:22:07,638
Purge and purify! Purge and purify!

1033
01:22:07,678 --> 01:22:12,268
Purge and purify! Purge and purify!

1034
01:22:12,474 --> 01:22:14,684
Purge and purify!

1035
01:22:14,726 --> 01:22:16,726
Let us begin.

1036
01:22:17,187 --> 01:22:19,607
All right, look, it's after midnight.
We need to move.

1037
01:22:19,690 --> 01:22:21,270
I need a four-man team in there.

1038
01:22:21,358 --> 01:22:23,568
I need three with me. Got it? Go!

1039
01:22:23,652 --> 01:22:25,362
Bishop!

1040
01:22:27,072 --> 01:22:28,242
Bishop!

1041
01:22:35,789 --> 01:22:36,789
Bishop!

1042
01:22:41,003 --> 01:22:42,003
Bishop!

1043
01:22:46,466 --> 01:22:47,796
I'm unarmed.

1044
01:22:48,927 --> 01:22:51,047
How well do you know this Dante?

1045
01:22:51,138 --> 01:22:53,558
Not well. So keep your eye on him.

1046
01:22:54,349 --> 01:22:56,559
Our boy is gonna get himself killed.

1047
01:22:57,102 --> 01:22:58,272
I'm unarmed.

1048
01:23:00,063 --> 01:23:02,073
You know this lunatic, Dante?

1049
01:23:03,233 --> 01:23:05,113
Yeah. I do.

1050
01:23:06,570 --> 01:23:07,860
Guns down.

1051
01:23:09,907 --> 01:23:11,567
What the hell are you doing here?

1052
01:23:12,534 --> 01:23:14,624
Trying to get yourself killed?

1053
01:23:16,955 --> 01:23:18,825
Is that the tunnel for the cathedral?

1054
01:23:19,791 --> 01:23:22,001
How the fuck do you know about the tunnel?

1055
01:23:25,589 --> 01:23:27,299
I asked you a question.

1056
01:23:33,263 --> 01:23:37,313
This is no longer an assassination.
This is a rescue mission.

1057
01:23:38,977 --> 01:23:42,107
Jesus died for their sins.

1058
01:23:45,984 --> 01:23:48,284
And now, our modern-day martyrs

1059
01:23:48,445 --> 01:23:50,655
will die for our trespasses.

1060
01:23:54,785 --> 01:23:57,545
Our martyr's name is Lawrence.

1061
01:23:58,664 --> 01:24:03,134
A lifelong drug addict.
He wants to make amends.

1062
01:24:04,378 --> 01:24:08,378
He wants to serve his god
and his government.

1063
01:24:10,133 --> 01:24:12,433
Let's thank Lawrence for his gift.

1064
01:24:12,469 --> 01:24:14,219
Thank you, Lawrence.

1065
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:19,360
- Thank you for your gift, Lawrence.
- Thank you very much, Lawrence.

1066
01:24:20,143 --> 01:24:21,643
We love you, Lawrence.

1067
01:24:30,279 --> 01:24:33,949
These weapons have been cleansed
with holy water,

1068
01:24:34,283 --> 01:24:38,953
and they are now instruments
of destruction.

1069
01:24:42,082 --> 01:24:43,082
Fuck!

1070
01:24:46,837 --> 01:24:49,167
You all know the loyal harmon James.

1071
01:24:49,673 --> 01:24:53,053
Worked with the nffa tirelessly
for many years.

1072
01:24:54,094 --> 01:24:57,514
Harmon will be
the first purger of the evening.

1073
01:25:05,272 --> 01:25:09,982
I'm sorry. No, no, no.
Please, please, please, please. No, no, no.

1074
01:25:11,695 --> 01:25:14,695
Please, no, no! I'm sorry! No, please!

1075
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:17,869
No! I'm sorry! Please, no, no!

1076
01:25:18,577 --> 01:25:20,037
Please, no!

1077
01:25:20,996 --> 01:25:24,496
Please! No! Please, please!

1078
01:25:24,541 --> 01:25:26,211
- I'm sorry!
- Release, harmon.

1079
01:25:27,461 --> 01:25:28,461
No!

1080
01:25:32,966 --> 01:25:33,966
No!

1081
01:25:36,303 --> 01:25:38,031
Release the violence
from your darkened heart!

1082
01:25:38,055 --> 01:25:41,065
Scour your soul. Let the light in.

1083
01:25:42,226 --> 01:25:44,556
You are blood-baptized.

1084
01:25:44,603 --> 01:25:48,193
And you are born again!

1085
01:25:54,112 --> 01:25:58,072
His light entered your heart, harmon.

1086
01:25:59,368 --> 01:26:00,368
Yeah.

1087
01:26:05,874 --> 01:26:08,044
The power of purging!

1088
01:26:08,085 --> 01:26:10,095
Purge and purify!

1089
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:12,710
Purge and purify!

1090
01:26:12,756 --> 01:26:16,586
Purge and purify! Purge and purify!

1091
01:26:17,135 --> 01:26:19,295
Purge and purify!

1092
01:26:19,388 --> 01:26:21,258
Purge and purify!

1093
01:26:27,604 --> 01:26:28,614
Psst.

1094
01:26:29,273 --> 01:26:31,943
No matter what happens, we stay together.

1095
01:26:35,112 --> 01:26:37,612
All right, this takes us
to the mechanical room.

1096
01:26:37,656 --> 01:26:39,946
From there, we can access the cathedral.

1097
01:26:50,169 --> 01:26:51,959
Stay there. Where do we go?

1098
01:26:52,004 --> 01:26:55,264
The church is above us.
So are 50 secret service agents.

1099
01:26:55,299 --> 01:26:57,629
You're gonna take the staircase
to the balcony.

1100
01:26:57,718 --> 01:27:00,758
Me and my guys, we're gonna enter
from behind the altar and this side here.

1101
01:27:00,804 --> 01:27:03,434
Okay, good. Let's go get our girl, yeah?

1102
01:27:08,896 --> 01:27:13,226
Before we get to our communal purge,
the holy horde of many martyrs,

1103
01:27:14,318 --> 01:27:16,948
I'd like to introduce a guest

1104
01:27:17,446 --> 01:27:22,826
who's going to be the centerpiece of a very
special purge ceremony tonight.

1105
01:27:25,537 --> 01:27:26,827
This person

1106
01:27:28,332 --> 01:27:31,962
has threatened to dismantle everything

1107
01:27:32,002 --> 01:27:35,012
that we, new founding fathers, have done.

1108
01:27:38,717 --> 01:27:42,387
We must rid ourselves

1109
01:27:44,181 --> 01:27:50,351
of the negative emotions
that she has stirred inside.

1110
01:27:51,688 --> 01:27:56,688
We must stop her
from poisoning our great country

1111
01:27:57,361 --> 01:28:00,361
by taking away our freedoms.

1112
01:28:03,784 --> 01:28:04,784
Yes!

1113
01:28:17,714 --> 01:28:21,514
I would like all the founding fathers
to come to the altar.

1114
01:28:22,052 --> 01:28:23,512
Join me, brothers,

1115
01:28:24,179 --> 01:28:27,179
as we eliminate evil

1116
01:28:28,225 --> 01:28:30,025
and purge as one.

1117
01:28:32,104 --> 01:28:36,324
There is a fountain
filled with blood

1118
01:28:36,567 --> 01:28:40,777
drawn from immanuel's veins

1119
01:28:42,906 --> 01:28:47,326
and sinners, plunged beneath that flood

1120
01:28:48,996 --> 01:28:53,826
lose all their guilty stains

1121
01:29:05,762 --> 01:29:07,012
lord of air,

1122
01:29:07,723 --> 01:29:09,313
lord of earth,

1123
01:29:09,391 --> 01:29:13,771
we ask that you receive this child
into your loving arms.

1124
01:29:19,484 --> 01:29:21,824
We are sinners.

1125
01:29:22,070 --> 01:29:23,660
Let us release.

1126
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:27,659
Caleb, our leader,

1127
01:29:27,951 --> 01:29:31,081
I invite you, sir, to
lead us in this purging

1128
01:29:31,622 --> 01:29:35,132
as you have and as you will.

1129
01:29:42,549 --> 01:29:48,179
Blessed be our new founding fathers
for letting us purge.

1130
01:30:01,652 --> 01:30:06,162
Blessed be America, a nation reborn.

1131
01:30:06,657 --> 01:30:07,817
Rifle!

1132
01:31:05,549 --> 01:31:07,089
She's alive.

1133
01:31:11,388 --> 01:31:12,428
Down!

1134
01:31:38,749 --> 01:31:40,419
Where you all at?

1135
01:31:45,547 --> 01:31:47,507
The hell are you all doing up there?

1136
01:31:50,052 --> 01:31:52,052
Bring your asses down here.

1137
01:31:56,016 --> 01:31:57,266
My negro.

1138
01:31:58,352 --> 01:31:59,482
Let's go.

1139
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:13,370
- Thank you.
- I got you. I got you.

1140
01:32:23,126 --> 01:32:24,126
Hi.

1141
01:32:25,671 --> 01:32:27,711
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1142
01:32:29,508 --> 01:32:31,548
Thank you. Again.

1143
01:32:33,804 --> 01:32:34,804
What was that?

1144
01:32:34,847 --> 01:32:37,427
My men taking care of business.
Go cover me.

1145
01:32:38,559 --> 01:32:41,599
We're headed out. Back exit. We have her.

1146
01:32:42,521 --> 01:32:44,311
And we have him.

1147
01:32:48,193 --> 01:32:49,193
Move.

1148
01:32:50,487 --> 01:32:51,487
Hey!

1149
01:32:52,155 --> 01:32:53,865
- Listen to me.
- Get off of me.

1150
01:32:53,949 --> 01:32:55,989
- Mr. bishop. Please.
- Watch our backs.

1151
01:32:56,076 --> 01:32:57,866
Just take a second
and listen to me.

1152
01:32:57,953 --> 01:33:00,503
- It's on our way to the exit.
- I can win without this.

1153
01:33:00,581 --> 01:33:01,961
- Please!
- Cover our backs.

1154
01:33:01,999 --> 01:33:04,169
You will win.
I'm gonna make sure that happens.

1155
01:33:04,251 --> 01:33:05,631
- Open up!
- Stop.

1156
01:33:06,086 --> 01:33:08,666
This is murder. If you do this,

1157
01:33:08,755 --> 01:33:10,665
you will be no different than them.

1158
01:33:10,757 --> 01:33:11,757
Get her.

1159
01:33:11,842 --> 01:33:13,432
Nope! Don't.

1160
01:33:14,678 --> 01:33:15,968
Listen to her.

1161
01:33:16,013 --> 01:33:17,473
She knows what she's doing.

1162
01:33:18,015 --> 01:33:20,065
We don't need to do this.

1163
01:33:20,142 --> 01:33:21,892
Hang on, Dante.

1164
01:33:21,977 --> 01:33:23,597
Get the fuck out of my way.

1165
01:33:24,730 --> 01:33:26,190
Wait, please!

1166
01:33:34,865 --> 01:33:36,415
Don't do this.

1167
01:33:36,867 --> 01:33:40,197
If you do this,
you will be no different than them.

1168
01:33:42,289 --> 01:33:45,289
We can't be like them.

1169
01:33:49,796 --> 01:33:51,046
Look at me.

1170
01:34:03,602 --> 01:34:04,732
Purge,

1171
01:34:05,479 --> 01:34:06,899
my son.

1172
01:34:07,564 --> 01:34:09,484
Purge.

1173
01:34:09,733 --> 01:34:13,153
It's your right as an American.

1174
01:34:14,696 --> 01:34:17,026
Kill me. Kill me.

1175
01:34:17,658 --> 01:34:18,828
Purge.

1176
01:34:19,326 --> 01:34:21,156
You're a son of god.

1177
01:34:22,996 --> 01:34:25,996
- God wants you to purge.
- Shut the fuck up!

1178
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:28,754
Coward.

1179
01:34:30,295 --> 01:34:31,495
Purge!

1180
01:34:32,256 --> 01:34:35,256
Do it! Do it! Yes! Yes!

1181
01:34:35,759 --> 01:34:37,219
Kill me!

1182
01:34:39,471 --> 01:34:42,931
Now, I'm gonna tell you right now,
i like black people,

1183
01:34:43,934 --> 01:34:46,484
but I ain't gonna let you all
shoot these white folks.

1184
01:34:46,562 --> 01:34:47,982
These are our white people.

1185
01:34:48,063 --> 01:34:49,063
Okay?

1186
01:34:50,148 --> 01:34:52,358
So, let's put 'em down.

1187
01:35:04,705 --> 01:35:06,295
You better fucking win.

1188
01:35:12,796 --> 01:35:14,666
Go. Go.

1189
01:35:14,923 --> 01:35:15,923
Move!

1190
01:35:37,487 --> 01:35:38,947
Oh, my god.

1191
01:35:41,491 --> 01:35:44,161
You murderous pig.

1192
01:35:44,703 --> 01:35:48,333
I am gonna beat the shit out of you
on election day.

1193
01:35:55,339 --> 01:35:57,669
I'm not as politically
correct as the senator.

1194
01:36:05,849 --> 01:36:07,389
Good night, blue cheese.

1195
01:36:10,229 --> 01:36:11,859
Well played, Leo.

1196
01:36:11,939 --> 01:36:13,189
Thanks, Joe.

1197
01:36:15,692 --> 01:36:16,992
Come on, man.

1198
01:36:17,236 --> 01:36:18,396
No, I'm not gonna hurt you.

1199
01:36:19,821 --> 01:36:21,491
We have to get you out of there.

1200
01:36:21,532 --> 01:36:23,322
Stay here, we'll find a vehicle.

1201
01:36:23,367 --> 01:36:24,867
What about these people?

1202
01:36:35,963 --> 01:36:38,013
Back, back, back! Get back!

1203
01:36:38,048 --> 01:36:40,258
- You got this.
- You know I got this.

1204
01:36:45,973 --> 01:36:47,393
- How bad is it?
- Not good.

1205
01:36:50,227 --> 01:36:53,227
Look, I got one more move in me.
Cover me. Go!

1206
01:37:31,768 --> 01:37:32,848
Shh! Be quiet!

1207
01:37:32,936 --> 01:37:35,396
Shut him up before he draws
the wrong kind of attention.

1208
01:38:14,311 --> 01:38:16,191
You motherfucker!

1209
01:38:34,289 --> 01:38:35,289
Get up.

1210
01:39:16,039 --> 01:39:17,329
Motherfucker.

1211
01:39:21,545 --> 01:39:24,345
- Okay. No, it's okay. You're safe.
- Thank you.

1212
01:39:24,381 --> 01:39:27,551
I gotta get the fuck outta here!
Let me out! Let me out!

1213
01:39:27,634 --> 01:39:28,644
Stop him!

1214
01:40:20,729 --> 01:40:21,729
Joe!

1215
01:40:23,023 --> 01:40:24,023
Joe?

1216
01:40:24,107 --> 01:40:26,317
You're gonna be okay, Joe. Come on.

1217
01:40:26,401 --> 01:40:27,629
We gotta get you somewhere, okay?

1218
01:40:27,653 --> 01:40:29,493
You're gonna be okay. I promise you.

1219
01:40:29,571 --> 01:40:31,781
There's nowhere to take me.

1220
01:40:32,449 --> 01:40:35,239
You're gonna be fine.
That's what's important.

1221
01:40:37,829 --> 01:40:40,579
She's gonna make sure of it.
Right, senator?

1222
01:40:41,250 --> 01:40:42,460
Yeah.

1223
01:40:52,010 --> 01:40:53,390
You got this.

1224
01:40:56,557 --> 01:40:57,807
I got this.

1225
01:41:01,645 --> 01:41:02,775
Marcos...

1226
01:41:12,155 --> 01:41:14,155
Joe, Joe, Joe.

1227
01:41:15,158 --> 01:41:16,158
Breathe, Joe, breathe.

1228
01:41:17,452 --> 01:41:18,452
No.

1229
01:41:20,163 --> 01:41:22,963
Wake up, Joe. Wake up!

1230
01:41:23,625 --> 01:41:24,625
Joe!

1231
01:41:54,907 --> 01:41:56,867
That was
senator roan this morning,

1232
01:41:56,950 --> 01:41:58,990
casting the first vote of the day.

1233
01:41:59,036 --> 01:42:01,116
It's been a great day
for the senator so far,

1234
01:42:01,205 --> 01:42:03,585
having already won New York,
California, and...

1235
01:42:03,916 --> 01:42:06,876
Wait, hold on, I am
getting word, right now,

1236
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:09,630
that the senator has also taken Florida,

1237
01:42:09,713 --> 01:42:14,013
which puts her well over
the 270 electoral votes for the win.

1238
01:42:14,051 --> 01:42:15,051
So that is it.

1239
01:42:15,135 --> 01:42:19,465
It is now official, the next president of
the United States will be Charlie roan.

1240
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:23,440
And president-elect roan has already stated
that her first order of business

1241
01:42:23,519 --> 01:42:27,269
will be taking executive action
to put an end to the purge.

1242
01:42:27,356 --> 01:42:28,356
Updates?

1243
01:42:29,650 --> 01:42:30,900
It's a landslide.

1244
01:42:38,575 --> 01:42:41,785
All right, I'll come by tomorrow.
We can get started on the ceiling.

1245
01:42:41,870 --> 01:42:43,080
Sounds good.

1246
01:42:54,258 --> 01:42:56,718
This place is really coming along, Marcos.

1247
01:42:58,762 --> 01:43:00,472
Joe would be really happy.

1248
01:43:03,725 --> 01:43:05,595
I'll catch you later, kid.

1249
01:43:23,495 --> 01:43:25,285
We're just now hearing reports

1250
01:43:25,372 --> 01:43:27,712
about a few scattered incidents
around the country

1251
01:43:27,791 --> 01:43:31,921
where nffa supporters
are reacting violently to this defeat.

1252
01:43:31,962 --> 01:43:37,132
They are burning cars, breaking windows,
looting, attacking police officers...
