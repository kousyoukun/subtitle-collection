00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:28,950
THE GREAT WALL HAS STOOD FOR CENTURIES

2
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,160
AS ONE OF MANKIND'S MOST ENDURING WONDERS.

3
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,760
IT SPANS OVER 5500 MILES

4
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,510
AND TOOK MORE THAN 1700 YEARS TO BUILD.

5
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,680
IT PROTECTED FROM MANY DANGERS.
SOME ARE KNOWN. SOME ARE LEGEND.

6
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,460
THIS IS ONE OF THE LEGENDS.

7
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,430
THE GREAT WALL

March 2017

9
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,940
Najid, cut the horses loose!

10
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,240
We have to turn back.

11
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,500
We have been riding
for six months.

12
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,480
- And we've lost twenty men.
- But we survived.

13
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,580
Yes. By chance.

14
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,600
Any one of us could have
met that same fate.

15
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,120
We were the strongest.
Remember why you're here.

16
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,320
In the West, we would be enemies,
and I wouldd have to kill you.

17
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,600
At least here we
have a common goal.

18
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,400
Oh, yes. This black powder.

19
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,300
It turns air into fire.
And kills a dozen men at one time.

20
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,160
- It is a weapon of our dreams.
- What if it's just a myth?

21
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,680
Men have sent word
that it's real.

22
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,220
And those men are dead.

23
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,040
And we are next.

24
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,800
We have no maps,

25
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,160
no medicines,

26
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,300
and no food.

27
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,280
No one is going back.

28
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,840
We take inventory of
what we have left

29
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,160
and finish what we started.

30
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,160
There's not much here.

31
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,800
The moon is strong.
When the horse are fresh, we move.

32
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,020
- To where?
- North.

33
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,520
If they keep after us, we'll
kill them in the mountains.

34
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,980
The magnet.

35
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,060
Too heavy.

36
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,300
- Useless.
- I'll have it.

37
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,580
It's all yours.

38
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,760
Amigo, only you would carry
a stupid magnet through the desert.

39
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,400
I can use it to
make a compass.

40
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,060
Rizzeti won't make it.

41
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,000
The wound is festering.

42
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,560
- We'll be dragging a corpse.
- I heard that.

43
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,380
He's earned the right
to die where he wants.

44
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,040
I've been left for dead twice.

45
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,160
- It was bad luck.
- For who?

46
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,580
The people who left me.

47
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,040
Where are they?

48
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,060
Hill tribes?

49
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,080
It's no man.

50
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,840
Then what is it?

51
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,900
Whatever it is...

52
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,420
it's hunting.

53
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,640
- What was that?
- I don't know.

54
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,740
I took its hand.

55
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,060
We need to move.

56
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,240
Agreed.

57
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,840
I'll take the hands with us.

58
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,140
What the hell for?

59
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,760
So someone can tell me what I just killed.

60
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,720
Persistent bastards,
aren't they?

61
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,780
We'll take the rise,
make a stand there.

62
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,880
What a long shitting way to go to die.

63
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,080
Mother of God.

64
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,280
Fire!

65
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,320
I have no need to
go down fighting.

66
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:52,980
Agreed.

67
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,160
I say we take our chanches
with the gents in front of us.

68
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,600
I haven't surrendered in a while, eh.

69
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,480
It'll come back to you.

70
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,960
Follow my lead. We'll be fine.

71
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,920
Of course, my friend.

72
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,560
Where you go, I follow.

73
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,120
You're doing such a
great job already.

74
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,480
All commanders to
the great hall!

75
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,480
All commanders report
to the General!

76
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,560
Make way!

77
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,720
Make way!

78
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,640
All commanders to
the large hall!

79
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,640
Make way!

80
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,640
Commander Lin is
needed immediately!

81
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,120
Calling Commander Lin!

82
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,540
Commander Lin is needed immediately!

83
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,780
They know what it is.

84
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,840
And they don't look
so happy to see it.

85
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,220
All the more reason to get
the hell out of here.

86
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,460
Our weapons are on that table.

87
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,500
Have you lost your mind?

88
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,320
I can take the guards on
the perimeter with my bow.

89
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,580
You cut the legs out
from under the officers.

90
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,900
I must confess this is
not my favorite plan.

91
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,780
Where was this found?

92
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,620
You speak English.

93
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,640
Fantastic.

94
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,440
Where was this found?

95
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,900
It wasn't found.

96
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,900
It was taken.

97
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,640
That thing killed three men
before we took it down.

98
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,640
Where?

99
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,800
Two days ride.

100
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,940
North, in the mountains.

101
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,360
He says two days ride north,
in the mountains.

102
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,160
- They claim to have killed it.
- Two days?

103
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,120
Earlier than we expected.

104
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,720
Strategist Wang!

105
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,200
I'm listening, General.

106
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,400
The two of them killed it?

107
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,360
- Two of you, you did this?
- Well...

108
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,180
- I killed it.
- Alone?

109
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,300
- He claims to have killed it alone.
- By himself?

110
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,060
Impossible.

111
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,220
Tell me how.

112
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,920
A swing of the sword.

113
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,800
The hand came away clean.

114
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,040
The beast fell
back into a chasm.

115
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,560
- Why are you here?
- We came to trade.

116
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,600
We were ambushed.

117
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,480
Guards!

118
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,360
You are soldiers.

119
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,620
Commander Lin.

120
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,760
Wait.

121
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,980
General.

122
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,880
They claim to be traders
who were ambushed.

123
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,020
These barbarians are liars.

124
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,620
Perhaps not.

125
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,380
They brought the claw here.

126
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,520
The wound is fresh.

127
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,720
There is green blood
on his sword.

128
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,600
Those prove his story.

129
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,740
To protect our secret,
we must kill them.

130
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,080
- Eliminate the possibility of trouble.
- I agree.

131
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,740
We should kill them!

132
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,000
General.

133
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,020
Until we find the truth,

134
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,340
- I advise we keep them alive.
- Alert!

135
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,320
General, signals from
the smoke towers!

136
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,260
We are under attack!

137
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,440
Take them to the stockade.

138
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:01,100
- All stations on full alert!
- Yes! All stations on full alert!

139
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,500
Are you killing us, Sister?

140
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,720
Two lost travelers?

141
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,520
What's happening here?

142
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,920
Is this bitch going to kill us?

143
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,640
I think she'd like that.

144
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,440
If it is death, my dear,

145
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,580
we need time to pray.

146
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,800
I'm trying here.

147
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,460
Sister, I know a siege when I see one.

148
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,200
What comes at you so hard
you need a wall like this?

149
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,140
- What the hell did we kill out there?
- Tao Tei.

150
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,000
You killed a Tao Tei scout.

151
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,180
You killed it alone.

152
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,460
You are correct.
We are under siege.

153
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,080
But we did not expect the
attack for another nine days.

154
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,040
Attack?

155
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,380
- Tao Tei?
- What the hell is a Tao Tei?

156
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,240
Many things about your
story have importance.

157
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,920
You are not to die today.

158
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,620
Hurry!

159
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,780
I'm sorry, sir.
I can not find the key.

160
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,520
Forget it!

161
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,400
Bring them to the wall.
Keep an eye on them!

162
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,800
General.

163
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,460
It's finally happening.

164
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,340
Yes.

165
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,560
60 years preparing for this moment.

166
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,060
Stop! Stop!

167
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,720
Go. Go!

168
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,100
Inside!

169
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,300
Stand still!

170
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,100
Get down! Get down!

171
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,400
The black are the foot soldiers.

172
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,580
- And the red?
- Those are the archers.

173
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,320
- And the blue?
- They're all women.

174
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,830
What the hell do they do?

175
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,660
Look at this army.

176
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,120
- Have you ever seen anything like this?
- Incredible.

177
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,020
Catch it!

178
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,880
They look nervous.

179
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,760
It's a big wall to be so nervous.

180
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,700
Do you hear it?

181
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,540
- Long distance weapons!
- Yes! Drums signal long distance weapons!

182
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,760
Grab it!

183
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,460
Light it!

184
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,280
Aim for the eyes! Aim for the eyes!

185
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,160
Crane Corps attack!

186
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,320
William, over there.

187
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,500
Why isn't he tied up?

188
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,260
There's our escape.

189
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,280
General. There's the queen.
She commands them.

190
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,040
Attack the queen!

191
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,060
- Close combat!
- Yes! Close combat!

192
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,860
Drums signal close combat.

193
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,940
We need to move!
We need to move or we die!

194
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,260
Go, go!

195
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,700
Go and fight!

196
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,380
Cut me loose!

197
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,600
- Fight or run?
- Run where?

198
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,500
Aim for the eyes!

199
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,040
William!

200
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,460
Hey! Bitch!

201
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,040
- William.
- I need a shot.

202
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,140
What god made those things?

203
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,160
None that we know.

204
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,080
- Think they'll hang us now?
- I could use the rest.

205
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,880
- You fought well today.
- You've earned General Shao's praise.

206
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,740
- Will they come back?
- Yes.

207
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,440
All we can do is prepare.

208
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,360
Take them to the barracks.

209
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,680
- They need rest.
- Yes!

210
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,520
Thank you for saving my life.

211
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,840
Commander Lin.

212
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,420
You grew up in the
Nameless Order.

213
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,260
I've taught you many things,

214
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,900
and you have been learning,

215
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,740
but they have been learning also.

216
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,200
Strategist Wang warned
they are evolving.

217
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,020
No one listened.

218
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,920
The enemies we're facing today

219
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,300
are more intelligent than 60 years ago.

220
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,960
Watch the foreigners closely.

221
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,660
They can never leave.

222
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,500
- We must protect the secrets of the Wall.
- Yes sir!

223
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,560
Who are you?

224
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,000
Easy.

225
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,760
I'm Ballard.

226
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,920
William.

227
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,400
This is Tovar.

228
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,140
What are you doing here?

229
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:45,220
- We came looking for black powder.
- I bet you did.

230
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,460
I came with merceneries for the same thing,

231
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,500
25 years ago.

232
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,260
And did you find it?

233
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:55,880
Finding it and leaving with it
alive are two different things.

234
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,500
You saved the west turret.
That was extremely diplomatic.

235
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,420
We weren't being diplomatic.

236
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,340
We were trying to stay alive.

237
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,940
- You smell like animals.
- Thank you.

238
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,880
Clean up and they'll feed you.

239
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,980
He knows where the powder is.

240
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,840
Then why is he still here?

241
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,160
He needs help getting out?

242
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,000
Right.

243
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,100
We play our part,

244
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,800
take the powder
and go home.

245
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,280
- I didn't sign up for this.
- Which part?

246
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:47,040
Well... All of it.
But mostly the monsters.

247
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,980
There's a lot of them.

248
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,760
We really do smell.

249
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,320
General Shao welcomes
you as honored guests

250
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,280
of the Nameless Order,

251
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,500
and thanks you for your skill and courage.

252
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,920
We are honored to be honored.

253
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,220
Is that the best you've got?

254
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,640
General.

255
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,480
I couldn't help wondering,

256
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,220
why would such an
accomplished archer

257
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,060
used such a primitive bow.

258
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,080
Commander Chen thinks your bow
is not worthy of your skill.

259
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,520
Tell him there's no better weapon here.

260
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,540
He claims his weapon is second to none.

261
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:17,920
Let him show us.
Give him some space!

262
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,880
- They wish to see you shoot.
- In here?

263
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,820
Unless he's afraid.
It's a large audience.

264
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,960
- What was that?
- He thinks you have fear.

265
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,220
Too many people.

266
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,540
- Get one of the cups.
- Now?

267
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,680
- Get one of the cups.
- I want to eat.

268
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,080
You remember how to do this?
Last Time didn't go so good.

269
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,420
- We were drunk.
- How high?

270
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,620
10 yards. Six hands
to the right.

271
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,640
- Turn around.
- No. I'll do it this way.

272
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,740
- On my count.
- Amigo...

273
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,600
 One.

274
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,500
Two.

275
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,560
Three.

276
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,560
Pull.

277
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,920
Good luck with that.
I want food.

278
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,780
- Who taught you English?
- Sir Ballard.

279
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,840
English and Latin.

280
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,080
Heard he's been here
for twenty five years.

281
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,800
You won't let him leave.

282
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,430
He must stay here.

283
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,320
What about us?

284
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,380
Pace yourself.
The meals are regular here.

285
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,780
I hope not to stay that long.

286
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,480
I like your thinking,

287
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,460
but I suggest you keep your plans private.

288
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:25,160
You aren't the first Westerners to
come here looking for black powder.

289
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,180
We'll discuss it tonight.
Bring your partner.

290
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:32,400
- How long have you been here?
- Always.

291
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:35,420
I was not five years
old when I came here.

292
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,460
I have no other family.

293
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,860
We're the same.

294
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,320
I was given to an army
before I can remember.

295
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:46,500
- As a soldier?
- Worse. As a gleaner.

296
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,620
Packs of children,
we'd clean the battlefields.

297
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,480
After, when the fighting's over,
I became a page.

298
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:57,040
- a pikeman's boy.
- For Your country?

299
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,020
No. I fought for food.

300
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,400
You fight to eat.

301
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,520
You live long enough,
you fight for money.

302
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,700
How many flag
do you fight for?

303
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,160
I don't know.

304
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,100
I fought for Harold against the Danes.

305
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:19,460
I saved a Duke's life.
I fought for him until he died.

306
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,420
Fought for Spain
against the Franks.

307
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,020
Fought for Franks
against Boulogne.

308
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,580
I fought for the Pope.

309
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,020
Many flags.

310
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,660
We are not the same.

311
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,180
Meet me on the Wall.
I have something to show you.

312
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,780
He should be careful with her.

313
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,420
She's very powerful here.

314
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,700
Then it is a fair contest.

315
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,460
Come.

316
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,980
You wish to try?

317
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,320
Men are too heavy.
Do you think we can pull him up?

318
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:33,030
She says men have so much to teach us.

319
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,340
I don't think
that's what she said.

320
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,940
You know what I think?

321
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,760
I think you're afraid.

322
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,380
You said that this morning.

323
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,400
And yet,

324
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,860
here I am.

325
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,820
Yes.

326
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,500
Here you are.

327
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,060
Will you jump?
Or not?

328
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,860
- These men know what they're doing?
- Wrong question.

329
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:30,680
Whether or not the cable is attached,
that is the question.

330
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,480
- And the answer?
- Xin ren.

331
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,060
Xin ren?

332
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,180
Xin ren means trust.
To have faith.

333
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,620
Here, in this army,
we fight for more than food or money.

334
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,190
We give our lives to something more.

335
00:35:55,300 --> 00:36:00,160
Xin ren is our flag.
Trust in each other.

336
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,300
In all ways, at all times.

337
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:21,100
Well, that's all well and good,
but I'm not jumping.

338
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,990
I'm alive today because I trust no one.

339
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:29,540
A man must learn to trust,
before he can be trusted.

340
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,760
Then you were right.

341
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,860
We're not the same.

342
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,400
Stay vigilant!
The next attack is coming!

343
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,100
My god!

344
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,320
A taste, a glimpse,

345
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,160
a few pilfered grains

346
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,240
from Strategist Wang's
supply of black powder.

347
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,620
He's mastered the transmutation
of these elements.

348
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,300
People speak of a weapon.

349
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,100
There are many weapons here.

350
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,480
Why have we not seen them?

351
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:11,300
There are many things you have not seen.

352
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,280
And many things you should pray

353
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,340
will not be needed
before the siege is through.

354
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,580
The Tao Tei will return.

355
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,260
When the drums call to battle,

356
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:29,740
the guards leave their post and
take their positions on the Wall.

357
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,660
That is our moment.

358
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,500
We want to be riding away
as the battle rages.

359
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,320
And the armory doors?

360
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,900
- You have keys?
- I have black powder,

361
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,200
enough for several doors.

362
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,140
He brings us in. We get us out.

363
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,260
Strategist Wang request your presence.

364
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,920
As you fought, where was this stone?

365
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,980
In my bag.

366
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,420
Its unseen force is powerfull.

367
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,520
I believe this strange
stone could help us.

368
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,740
We try everything.

369
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:17,360
- Where are the Tao Tei now?
- The mountains, regrouping.

370
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,910
Where do they come from?

371
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,180
About 20 centuries ago,

372
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:28,140
There was an emperor whose greed
brought deep suffering to all of China.

373
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:31,720
The heaven sent a meteor
that struck Gouwu Mountain

374
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,540
turning it green and
releasing Tao Tei.

375
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:39,320
From that day on,
the Tao Tei rise every sixty years,

376
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,600
to scourge the north of China.

377
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:47,120
They come to remind us of what happens
when greed is unchecked.

378
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:51,180
They eat anything, alive or dead,

379
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:57,060
and take food to their queen.
She depends on her soldiers to feed her.

380
00:38:57,330 --> 00:39:02,000
Only with the food they
provide is she able to multiply.

381
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:06,860
The capital and its 2 million people,

382
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,000
is only 800 li away.

383
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:13,360
If the Tao Tei ever had 
that much nourisment

384
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,520
no corner of the world would be safe.

385
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:22,000
- You cann't hunt them?
- Men try. They disappear.

386
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,040
We never find their bones.

387
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:29,620
Troops unaccounted for at the West Tower!

388
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,740
Why did they leave the bodies?

389
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,940
Dismount!

390
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,080
Formation!

391
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,180
Advance!

392
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,740
Stop.

393
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,680
Commander Lin.

394
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,360
General...

395
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,120
They led us into a trap.

396
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,740
We underestimated their intelligence.

397
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,900
The Nameless Order...

398
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,420
- is yours to command.
- General...

399
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,380
Commanders, this is
my final order...

400
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,740
from this day forward,

401
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,140
Commander Lin will lead you.

402
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:26,200
The soldiers of the Nameless Order
will stand firm.

403
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,220
The wall must not fall!
We will defeat the Tao Tei!

404
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:35,320
- Rest in peace.
- Rest in peace!

405
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:15,040
This is envoy Shen from the palace.

406
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:18,820
He has brought important records
to help with the coming battle.

407
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,260
- This is a 900 years old batte report.
- A 900 years old battle report.

408
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,060
At the Hans Gate,
three beasts mounted the wall.

409
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:35,480
They killed many men as they went forward.

410
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,120
Then, by the grace of the ancient gods,

411
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,020
the beasts stopped

412
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,815
and sat peacefully,
as we slaughtered them.

413
00:44:47,815 --> 00:44:51,144
There was a magnet on
site just like this one.

414
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:54,920
At the Hans Gate,
was a magnet just like this one.

415
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:00,485
I believe that magnet was
the reason the two of you Westerners

416
00:45:00,485 --> 00:45:02,844
killed the Tao Tei so easily.

417
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,503
I believe the magnet
makes the Tao Tei deaf.

418
00:45:07,664 --> 00:45:09,964
Without instruction,
they fall still.

419
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:16,440
- How to prove that?
- How can we be sure?

420
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,920
Why not try it?

421
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,860
Capture a Tao Tei.
See if it works.

422
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:26,500
- He wants to try. He wants to catch one.
- How?

423
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,660
No net is strong enough.

424
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,760
Hunt them. Like a whale.
You know what that is.

425
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:37,700
A water beast.
A hundred times the size of a Tao Tei.

426
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:42,000
A spear that grabs. Hook the bone
Pulled them up.

427
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:45,860
Use a spear, hook them.
So we can catch them.

428
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:48,540
I've seen it done in Spain.

429
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,460
He claims to have seen
it done in Spain.

430
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,180
What the hell are you doing?

431
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,400
We need to be free when
the attack comes.

432
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:59,280
How many chances do you think we will get?

433
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:04,800
Be injured. Be missing.
Be a coward.

434
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,880
Get out of this.

435
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,740
We did enough.

436
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:22,420
The mixture must be strong
to put the creature to sleep.

437
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,200
- Spread it on evenly.
- Yes, Commander!

438
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:07,800
Snap out of it!

439
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:28,200
Useless idiot! report to the kitchen
where you belong!

440
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,180
- Yes, Commander.
- Go!

441
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:06,280
- He'll be here.
- When? When it was over?

442
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:09,080
- We will start and he will find us.
- Start?

443
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:13,020
We're jumping off a cliff here.
I have everything.

444
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:17,160
Powder, tools, maps.
It's all hidden and arranged along the route.

445
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,200
Once we start, there's no going back.

446
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:10,400
- Death Squad ready!
- Yes! Death Squad go!

447
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,460
Blades ready!

448
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:25,860
Blades forward!

449
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,260
- Attack! 
- Go!

450
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,160
Left! Right!

451
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,180
- I'll find him.
- Forget him.

452
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,240
He'd rather die trying
to impress the new general

453
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:14,760
than grab the key to every counting room
and brothel in the world.

454
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:19,240
Good God, man. The time is now.
I can't go without him.

455
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,540
- More the spoils for us!
- We need his bow!

456
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:27,520
Harpoons!

457
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,800
- Harpoons, Now!
- Yes! Harpoons, fire!

458
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:35,900
Fire!

459
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:17,620
There!

460
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,840
- Move!
- It's the last one!

461
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:48,380
- Pull!
- No, no, no. Stop!

462
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,840
- Hold!
- There's too much tension! Chain will break.

463
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:54,600
- That way. That way.
- Let him run!

464
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:02,720
Stop! Stop! We need longer 
for the sleeping potion to work.

465
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,080
That way. That way.

466
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:13,040
We need to isolate it.
Sparate it from the others.

467
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,000
- Ring of Fire!
- Yes! Ring of Fire!

468
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:36,280
- The chain won't hold much longer!
- We're losing him!

469
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:47,800
- William, wait. Screaming arrows!
- Yes! Screaming arrows!

470
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,660
These arrows will scream
as the Tao Tei run.

471
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,000
Aim for the sound.

472
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:09,800
Aim inside the circle.
Blanket the whole area.

473
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,320
Fire!

474
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,540
Pull!

475
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,680
I'm only saving you
so I can kill you myself.

476
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,200
Grab the axe, we're fighting blind.

477
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:37,600
- Not yet!
- I know what to do!

478
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:11,460
- The fire is not holding them back here.
- Die well, brother.

479
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,040
- What the hell are you doing?
- She's listening.

480
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:27,480
- Prepare black powder weapon!
- Prepare black powder weapon!

481
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,640
Prepare to light the fuses!

482
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,280
Yes!
Prepare to light the fuses!

483
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:04,360
- Did it work?
-Yes.

484
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,300
The beast was captured.

485
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:10,800
- My friend...
- He was unharmed.

486
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,500
Why did you go over the Wall?

487
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:33,900
Xin ren.
Did I say that right?

488
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,060
Thank you.

489
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,160
Black powder.

490
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:50,860
It is a terrible weapon.

491
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:55,880
It would be better if you had never see it.

492
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:03,320
I know very little of the outside world.

493
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:09,180
But it seems to me, the greed of men
is not that different than the Tao Tei.

494
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:11,280
Is that true?

495
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,740
The strong take what they want.

496
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,300
Forget what you have seen.

497
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:21,220
Excellent! Send it to the
capital immediately.

498
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,780
No! We need to study it here.

499
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,780
If a Tao Tei is captured alive,
it must be sent to the emperor.

500
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,340
This is an Imperial Order.

501
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,240
You're much braver than they think.

502
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,340
You're wounded?

503
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:29,780
I was looking for you.

504
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:32,600
To say thank you.

505
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:42,460
You feel good, huh?
Maybe you sing a little song, eh?

506
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:45,400
I will join you.

507
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:49,180
We can sing together
how you saved the gratefull Chinos.

508
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:51,680
You saw what happened out there, 
and that's what you say?

509
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:53,040
I see black powder.

510
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:58,580
- I see a man forget his friends.
- The black powder's not going anywhere.

511
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:00,660
What goes nowhere is you.

512
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,540
You'll never get what
you want from this.

513
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:10,200
You think they see you 
as some kind of hero?

514
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:14,560
A man of virtue?
Maybe you can fool them,

515
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,340
but I know what you are.

516
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,100
You know what you are.

517
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:25,300
A thief, a liar,

518
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:29,120
and a killer.

519
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,900
You can never undo things you've done.

520
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,620
and you will never be anything.

521
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,400
Good to see you
again, amigo.

522
01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:01,120
Tao Tei movement!

523
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:05,080
All troops to the Wall!

524
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:09,380
- Nothing?
- No.

525
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,520
- How do you know he won't betray us?
- I don't.

526
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:14,100
They'll kill him. 
They'll kill him no matter what.

527
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,720
The time they spend killing him,

528
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:18,920
is time they are not chasing us.

529
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:04,060
Careful with that.
There's powder here.

530
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:17,360
Tovar.

531
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:52,180
General, it goes all the way through.
Tao Tei have breached the wall.

532
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:54,080
They're smarter than we thought.

533
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:57,120
- Summon my commanders immediately!
- Yes, General!

534
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:20,000
Have a look.
See if it's gone out.

535
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,200
- Is it safe?
- Of course it is.

536
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:54,840
Shake it off, man.
To work.

537
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:59,780
I thought you said it was safe?

538
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,520
We're in, didn't we?

539
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:18,420
- You're here.
- We've come to our senses, eh?

540
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:21,500
Ballard has planned well.
Getting out is easy.

541
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:25,980
There's a gate. 20 miles west.
We dodge the hill tribes.

542
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:30,700
- We can make it.
- They need us here.

543
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,080
They need more than us.

544
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:36,000
- These people are doomed.
- Don't be a fool.

545
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:37,420
I've been a fool.

546
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:38,800
I'm done with it.

547
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:40,980
Brother, please.

548
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:43,960
We've been fighting for nothing.

549
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:46,380
For greed.

550
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:52,580
Amigo, after all the blood,
the cold, and pain,

551
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:56,560
with this black powder
in our saddle bags, we win.

552
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,160
You come with me.

553
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:02,880
I can't do that now.

554
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:07,860
- Stay and fight.
- William...

555
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:15,880
- Think he's dead?
- It'd take a lot more than that.

556
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:24,140
All of the attacks have been a diversion,
while they dug this tunnel.

557
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,000
They have breached the wall.

558
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:31,500
Once they reach the capital,
nothing in the world can stop them.

559
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,720
At a full gallop,
it's two days to the capital.

560
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:40,040
- There's no way we can catch them.
- The wind is strong now.

561
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:45,340
It blows from the north all day tomorrow.
We have to use the balloons.

562
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:49,560
- If it works, how long to Bianliang?
- Six hours if the wind hold.

563
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,100
If we make it alive.

564
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:55,200
General, none of the tests have worked.

565
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:58,340
Get ready!

566
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:09,780
Come on!

567
01:07:20,296 --> 01:07:25,472
THE CAPITAL
BIANLIANG

568
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:02,480
- How did you capture it?
- Your Excellency!

569
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:07,700
Your Excellency, It's the magnet.
It keeps the beast under control.

570
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:12,440
This is the most important discovery
in the history of the Tao Tei.

571
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:16,820
- We will investigate immediately.
- Bring him here!

572
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:36,980
- I tried to stop...
- You dare to speak to me?

573
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:43,040
- I didn't do this.
- And you came here to trade.

574
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:46,400
And you knew nothing of black powder.

575
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,100
What a fool you must think I am.

576
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:54,120
If I was with them, why would I be here?
I tried to stop them.

577
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:55,300
Liar!

578
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:57,980
You lie.

579
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:04,220
- Some part of you knows that's not true.
- If I were not the General,

580
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:06,640
I would kill you myself.

581
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:09,880
General!

582
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:17,680
- General.
- Speak up.

583
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:24,000
I was there when it happened.
I saw him try to stop them.

584
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:34,280
Are you sure?

585
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:39,740
If you're lying, I'll have your head!

586
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:43,300
I swear on my vow to the Nameless Order!

587
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:58,620
Lock him up.

588
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:01,800
- Send the cavalry. Go after the two that got away.
-Yes, General.

589
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:27,620
Which way, left or right?

590
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:30,880
Go up and take a look from the high ground.

591
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:50,340
No! Bastard!

592
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:34,620
- Keep it steady! - Yes, General!

593
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:37,100
- Watch the powder! - Yes, General!

594
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:12,860
What happened?

595
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:18,580
What happened?
We have failed.

596
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,420
The Tao Tei are in the kingdom.

597
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:25,720
You are free to leave.
Take what you wish and go.

598
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:29,360
- This was the General's final order.
- Where is she?

599
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:36,340
To do what? To fight?

600
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:39,240
- Is there a chance?
- There's only one.

601
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:44,620
Kill the Queen.
Kill the Queen, or we all die.

602
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:49,200
Leave.
Tell the world what you have seen,

603
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:51,840
and tell them what is coming.

604
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:16,260
I'll need my bow.

605
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,320
If I'm to join you, I'll need my bow.

606
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:33,280
Strategist Wang!
Please take me with you.

607
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,140
He wishes to join us.

608
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:03,140
The distance is the key.
The magnet is only effective when close to the beast.

609
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:08,160
Therefore, the effect
weakens as it gets further away.

610
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:11,160
You see I have it under complete control.

611
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:16,280
Write down nine feet.

612
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,020
- Steer to the rear of the palace.
- Yes! To the rear of the palace!

613
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:09,860
Above you!

614
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,880
- Light a grenade!
-Yes, sir!

615
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:25,280
Behind you!

616
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:39,740
I set you free.

617
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,040
And here I am.

618
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:45,000
There's the queen!

619
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:52,200
They will not attack while the queen is feeding.

620
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:56,020
We have a chance!
Hold on!

621
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,220
State your purpose!

622
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:28,800
General Lin Mae from Nameless Order.
At your service!

623
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:38,880
What took you so long?

624
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:41,280
The Tao Tei overrun the city!

625
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:45,080
Thousands of soldiers and innocent are dead.

626
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:47,100
You're too late!

627
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,320
Where is the captured Tao Tei?

628
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:52,260
- In the dungeon!
- We need it to kill the queen.

629
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,300
Once she is dead,
The Tao Tei can not function.

630
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:57,220
Without her signal, their
whole army will freeze.

631
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:19,400
There is an underground canal here.

632
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:20,720
Has it been breached?

633
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:23,340
The Tao Tei should all be above ground.

634
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:24,960
And the one we captured?

635
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:26,440
We load it up.

636
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:30,560
We feed him. 
And it will return to its queen.

637
01:19:31,090 --> 01:19:32,020
Good.

638
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:42,720
You'll have one hell of a scar,

639
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:45,920
- but you'll live.
- He says you will live.

640
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:47,900
We'll come back for him.

641
01:21:06,530 --> 01:21:07,890
They've broken through!

642
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:32,930
Patience, William.

643
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,560
And it will go to the Queen when it's done?

644
01:22:53,570 --> 01:22:54,610
It should.

645
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:58,160
It will.

646
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:11,520
Let it in.

647
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:36,380
I can get a shot from above.

648
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:43,670
Go!
I'll hold them back.

649
01:24:06,770 --> 01:24:08,570
Wait. Not yet.

650
01:24:16,690 --> 01:24:17,600
Hit.

651
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:29,410
Go higher.
I'll get a better shot.

652
01:24:42,490 --> 01:24:45,250
General! It's up to you now!

653
01:25:37,930 --> 01:25:41,200
We have one black powder weapon left.
Give me the spear.

654
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:45,100
I've trained for this my whole life.

655
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:47,930
Trust.

656
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:53,730
I'll get you the shot.

657
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:40,480
I've got you.

658
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:00,860
So, how's life without me?

659
01:28:01,890 --> 01:28:02,880
A little slow.

660
01:28:06,450 --> 01:28:09,730
- You're a hero after all.
- Oh, it looks that way.

661
01:28:09,930 --> 01:28:11,690
You seem pleased with yourself..

662
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:14,200
And what are they giving you
for all your troubles?

663
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:16,500
A bag of gold?

664
01:28:16,610 --> 01:28:19,180
A victory parade along the top of the Wall?

665
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:21,050
All the black powder I can carry.

666
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:24,370
And a cavalry escort
to get me home safely.

667
01:28:25,810 --> 01:28:27,580
- Well, congratulations.
- Thank you.

668
01:28:29,130 --> 01:28:30,290
So what is this?

669
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:33,820
- You're here to rub my nose in it?
- Well, would you blame me?

670
01:28:34,250 --> 01:28:36,370
The last time I saw you,
you left me for dead.

671
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:38,260
And the time before, I saved your life.

672
01:28:38,690 --> 01:28:39,480
True.

673
01:28:42,130 --> 01:28:44,250
You know, the Emperor gave me a choice.

674
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:48,370
I could take the black powder
or I could take you.

675
01:28:51,530 --> 01:28:53,290
Please tell me you chose the powder.

676
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:02,250
I don't even know you anymore.

677
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,320
The horses are saddled and waiting.
Best we ride before nightfall.

678
01:29:14,610 --> 01:29:15,640
I'll be inside.

679
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:17,500
Don't leave without me.

680
01:29:28,690 --> 01:29:30,140
I came to say goodbye.

681
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:35,010
I understand congratulations are in order.

682
01:29:35,740 --> 01:29:37,850
General of the northwest territory.

683
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:40,040
Quite an honor.

684
01:29:42,450 --> 01:29:44,180
Seems you've made your choice.

685
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:48,740
Oh, him? Believe me, I'm already think
about trading him back for the powder.

686
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:50,480
I heard that.

687
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:58,680
Perhaps we were both wrong.

688
01:30:00,260 --> 01:30:02,250
We are more similar than I thought.

689
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:09,730
Thank you General.

690
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:40,100
- Are you sure you don't want to go back?
- Of course I do.

691
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:43,180
I just don't trust you
to make it out of here alone.

692
01:31:09,650 --> 01:31:19,650
