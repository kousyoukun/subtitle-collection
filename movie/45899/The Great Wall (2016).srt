1
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,050
长城名列人类文明的壮举之一
THE GREAT WALL HAS STOOD FOR CENTURIES

2
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,260
千年来 屹立不倒
AS ONE OF MANKIND'S MOST ENDURING WONDERS.

3
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,860
它绵延五千五百英里
IT SPANS OVER 5500 MILES

4
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,610
历经一千七百多年修建完成
AND TOOK MORE THAN 1700 YEARS TO BUILD.

5
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,780
它防御着形形色色的敌人 有真实的故事 也有传说
IT PROTECTED FROM MANY DANGERS. SOME ARE KNOWN. SOME ARE LEGEND.

6
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,560
这就是其中的一则传说
THIS IS ONE OF THE LEGENDS.

7
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:23,530
长   城
THE GREAT WALL

8
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,040
纳吉 把马放开！
Najid, cut the horses loose!

9
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,340
我们得调头回去
We have to turn back.

10
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,600
都走了六个月了
We have been riding for six months.

11
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,580
- 我们死了20几个人了 - 还没死光呢
- And we've lost twenty men. - But we survived.

12
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,680
对 快死光了
Yes. By chance.

13
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,700
下一个死的 就该轮到我们了
Any one of us could have met that same fate.

14
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,220
我们几个是最棒的 记住我们来的目地
We were the strongest. Remember why you're here.

15
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,420
要照以前 你敢这么说  我早把你给杀死了
In the West, we would be enemies, and I wouldd have to kill you.

16
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,700
好在我们的目标一致
At least here we have a common goal.

17
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,500
对 黑火药
Oh, yes. This black powder.

18
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,400
它能把空气变成火焰 一次就能干掉十几个人…
It turns air into fire. And kills a dozen men at one time.

19
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,260
- 这是我梦寐以求的武器 - 那要只是一个传说呢？
- It is a weapon of our dreams. - What if it's just a myth?

20
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,780
有人发誓说 千真万确
Men have sent word that it's real.

21
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,320
那些人 都死了
And those men are dead.

22
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,140
现在该轮到我们了
And we are next.

23
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,900
没有地图
We have no maps,

24
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,260
没有药品
no medicines,

25
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,400
没有吃的
and no food.

26
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,380
不行 谁都不能回去
No one is going back.

27
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,940
我们先清点一下剩下的东西
We take inventory of what we have left

28
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,260
干完这一票再说
and finish what we started.

29
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,260
没什么可用的
There's not much here.

30
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,900
月色很好 等马吃饱了 我们就走
The moon is strong. When the horse are fresh, we move.

31
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,120
- 去哪里？ - 往北
- To where? - North.

32
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,620
契丹人如果追上来  就在山里干掉他们
If they keep after us, we'll kill them in the mountains.

33
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,080
一块磁石
The magnet.

34
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,160
太重了
Too heavy.

35
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,400
- 没什么用 - 留着
- Useless. - I'll have it.

36
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,680
你自己拿着
It's all yours.

37
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,860
伙计 你要背块石头过沙漠啊？
Amigo, only you would carry a stupid magnet through the desert.

38
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,500
我能用它做个指南针
I can use it to make a compass.

39
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,160
里泽蒂不行了
Rizzeti won't make it.

40
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,100
他伤得太重
The wound is festering.

41
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,660
- 我们现在等于是拖着一具尸体在走 - 我听见了！
- We'll be dragging a corpse. - I heard that.

42
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,480
死在那里 是他的选择
He's earned the right to die where he wants.

43
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,140
我也被人扔下过两次
I've been left for dead twice.

44
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,260
- 都倒霉了 - 谁倒霉了？
- It was bad luck. - For who?

45
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,680
那些扔下我的人
The people who left me.

46
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,140
他们去哪里了？
Where are they?

47
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,160
是契丹人？
Hill tribes?

48
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,180
不是人类
It's no man.

49
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,940
那是什么？
Then what is it?

50
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,000
不管是什么…
Whatever it is...

51
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,520
它在捕食
it's hunting.

52
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,740
- 什么东西？ - 不知道
- What was that? - I don't know.

53
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,840
我砍了它的爪子
I took its hand.

54
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,160
那…那我们现在…
We need to move.

55
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,340
赶快走
Agreed.

56
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,940
得带着这个
I'll take the hands with us.

57
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,240
带它干嘛？
What the hell for?

58
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,860
得弄清楚 它是什么东西
So someone can tell me what I just killed.

59
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,820
这帮王八蛋  还真是锲而不舍啊？
Persistent bastards, aren't they?

60
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,880
我们上山去 居高临下打
We'll take the rise, make a stand there.

61
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,980
人要死了 还得兜个风
What a long shitting way to go to die.

62
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,180
这下完了
Mother of God.

63
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,380
放箭！
Fire!

64
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,420
这样回去 也是死
I have no need to go down fighting.

65
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,080
没错
Agreed.

66
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,260
和前面的绅士们 碰碰运气吧
I say we take our chanches with the gents in front of us.

67
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,700
我可很久没有投降过了
I haven't surrendered in a while, eh.

68
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,580
那就再来一次
It'll come back to you.

69
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,060
只要你听我的 平安无事
Follow my lead. We'll be fine.

70
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,020
当然得听你的
Of course, my friend.

71
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,660
我们是朋友嘛
Where you go, I follow.

72
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,220
都这样了 还能平安无事？
You're doing such a great job already.

73
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,580
传鹿军 郑将军！
All commanders to the great hall!

74
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,580
传鹤军 林将军！
All commanders report to the General!

75
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,660
闪开！
Make way!

76
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,820
闪开！
Make way!

77
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,740
急传鹤军 林将军！
All commanders to the large hall!

78
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,740
闪开！
Make way!

79
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,740
传鹿军 郑将军！
Commander Lin is needed immediately!

80
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,220
急传鹤军 林将军！
Calling Commander Lin!

81
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,640
绍殿帅 急传林将军！
Commander Lin is needed immediately!

82
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,880
他们对那个感兴趣
They know what it is.

83
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,940
而且表情十分凝重
And they don't look so happy to see it.

84
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,320
必须得找个机会杀出去
All the more reason to get the hell out of here.

85
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,560
我们的兵器在桌上
Our weapons are on that table.

86
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,600
你确定 你没疯？
Have you lost your mind?

87
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,420
我只要拿到弓箭 就能干掉那些士兵
I can take the guards on the perimeter with my bow.

88
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,680
你去干掉那几个当官的
You cut the legs out from under the officers.

89
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,000
你真具有非凡的想象力
I must confess this is not my favorite plan.

90
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,880
哪里捡的？
Where was this found?

91
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,720
是问我吗？
You speak English.

92
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,740
审完了就杀
Fantastic.

93
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,540
我问你在哪里捡的？
Where was this found?

94
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,000
不是捡的
It wasn't found.

95
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,000
是我砍的
It was taken.

96
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,740
之前 它杀了我们三个人
That thing killed three men before we took it down.

97
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,740
在哪里？
Where?

98
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,900
骑马往北 两天
Two days ride.

99
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,040
山里
North, in the mountains.

100
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,460
他说在北山 距此两日行程
He says two days ride north, in the mountains.

101
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,260
- 他自称 曾斩杀一头饕餮 - 两日？
- They claim to have killed it. - Two days?

102
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,220
比我们预计的时间提前了
Earlier than we expected.

103
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,820
王军师！
Strategist Wang!

104
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,300
殿帅 我在听
I'm listening, General.

105
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,500
是他们杀的？
The two of them killed it?

106
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,460
- 你们两个 一起杀的？ - 那个…我们…
- Two of you, you did this? - Well...

107
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,280
- 我杀的 - 你一个人？
- I killed it. - Alone?

108
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,400
- 他说 是他一个人杀的 - 他一个人？
- He claims to have killed it alone. - By himself?

109
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,160
怎么可能？
Impossible.

110
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,320
你是怎么杀的？
Tell me how.

111
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,020
就那么一砍一劈
A swing of the sword.

112
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,900
它爪子断了
The hand came away clean.

113
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,140
身体向后一倒 掉进山谷里了
The beast fell back into a chasm.

114
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,660
- 你们来这里干什么？ - 我们是商人
- Why are you here? - We came to trade.

115
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,700
遇上了埋伏
We were ambushed.

116
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,580
来人！
Guards!

117
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,460
你们是军人
You are soldiers.

118
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,720
林将军
Commander Lin.

119
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,860
不可
Wait.

120
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,080
殿帅
General.

121
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,980
他们谎称 是遭遇契丹人伏击的商人
They claim to be traders who were ambushed.

122
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,120
这蛮夷 真能吹牛
These barbarians are liars.

123
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,720
未必
Perhaps not.

124
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,480
有饕餮断掌为证
They brought the claw here.

125
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,620
刀剑切口 一目了然
The wound is fresh.

126
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,820
在他们的剑和衣服上 都有绿血
There is green blood on his sword.

127
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,700
完全有那个可能
Those prove his story.

128
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,840
末将以为 无论巧合与否  应立即处死二人
To protect our secret, we must kill them.

129
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,180
- 以防后患 - 林将军说的是
- Eliminate the possibility of trouble. - I agree.

130
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,840
砍了算了！
We should kill them!

131
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,100
殿帅
General.

132
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,120
他们来历 尚未查明
Until we find the truth,

133
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,440
- 我看 还是多留几天吧 - 报！
- I advise we keep them alive. - Alert!

134
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,420
启禀殿帅大人 烽火台 狼烟四起！
General, signals from the smoke towers!

135
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,360
有敌来犯！
We are under attack!

136
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,540
先将俘虏 押至北楼
Take them to the stockade.

137
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,200
- 传令 全体将士 准备迎敌！ - 是！准备迎敌！
- All stations on full alert! - Yes! All stations on full alert!

138
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,600
小娘子 你真要处决我们吗？
Are you killing us, Sister?

139
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,820
我们两只可怜的迷途羔羊？
Two lost travelers?

140
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,620
这到底怎么回事啊？
What's happening here?

141
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,020
你不是保证平安无事的吗？
Is this bitch going to kill us?

142
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,740
先别这么紧张
I think she'd like that.

143
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,540
真要杀我们啊 亲爱的
If it is death, my dear,

144
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,680
你下得了手吗
we need time to pray.

145
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,900
我得跟她套套交情
I'm trying here.

146
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,560
小娘子 我知道 你们被围攻了
Sister, I know a siege when I see one.

147
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,300
可是你们城墙这么高 不用耽心的
What comes at you so hard you need a wall like this?

148
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,240
- 我砍的 到底是什么东西？ - 饕餮
- What the hell did we kill out there? - Tao Tei.

149
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,100
你杀了一只饕餮侦查兵
You killed a Tao Tei scout.

150
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,280
就凭你一个人
You killed it alone.

151
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,560
和我们预想的一样 大战将至
You are correct. We are under siege.

152
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,180
只是他们的攻击 提前了九天
But we did not expect the attack for another nine days.

153
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,140
攻击？
Attack?

154
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,480
- 饕餮？ - 饕餮是什么东西？
- Tao Tei? - What the hell is a Tao Tei?

155
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,340
我还有问题 要问你们
Many things about your story have importance.

156
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,020
所以 让你们先活着
You are not to die today.

157
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,720
快！
Hurry!

158
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,880
启禀军师 钥匙找不着了
I'm sorry, sir. I can not find the key.

159
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,620
算了！
Forget it!

160
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,500
带他们上城 交熊军 临时看押！
Bring them to the wall. Keep an eye on them!

161
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,900
殿帅
General.

162
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,560
终于来了
It's finally happening.

163
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,440
是啊
Yes.

164
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,660
这一仗 等了六十年
60 years preparing for this moment.

165
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,160
站住！站住！
Stop! Stop!

166
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,820
进去 进去！
Go. Go!

167
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,200
进笼！
Inside!

168
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,400
站住！
Stand still!

169
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,200
坐下！坐下！
Get down! Get down!

170
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,500
黑色的 应该是步兵
The black are the foot soldiers.

171
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,680
- 红的呢？ - 红的是弓弩手
- And the red? - Those are the archers.

172
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,420
- 这蓝色的是？ - 都是女人
- And the blue? - They're all women.

173
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,230
女人来搞什么？
What the hell do they do?

174
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,760
装备精良啊
Look at this army.

175
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,220
- 你见过这样的军队吗？ - 真厉害
- Have you ever seen anything like this? - Incredible.

176
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,120
接枪！
Catch it!

177
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,980
你说城墙这么高
They look nervous.

178
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,860
他们到底紧张什么啊？
It's a big wall to be so nervous.

179
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,800
怎么听着不对劲啊？
Do you hear it?

180
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,640
- 远攻！ - 是！战鼓队传令 远攻！
- Long distance weapons! - Yes! Drums signal long distance weapons!

181
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,860
扶好！
Grab it!

182
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,560
点火！
Light it!

183
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,380
- 对准腋下之目！ - 对准腋下之目！
Aim for the eyes! Aim for the eyes!

184
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,260
飞索攻击！
Crane Corps attack!

185
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,420
威廉 你看那里
William, over there.

186
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,600
他怎么没被绑着？
Why isn't he tied up?

187
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,360
我们有机会了
There's our escape.

188
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,380
殿帅 那应该是兽王 它在指挥
General. There's the queen. She commands them.

189
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,140
攻击兽王！
Attack the queen!

190
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,160
- 近战！ - 是！近战！
- Close combat! - Yes! Close combat!

191
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,960
战鼓队传令 近战！
Drums signal close combat.

192
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,040
我们得离开！ 要不然 我们就死定了！
We need to move! We need to move or we die!

193
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,360
上 上！
Go, go!

194
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,800
上去打它！
Go and fight!

195
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,480
快帮我解开！
Cut me loose!

196
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,700
- 打还是逃？ - 往哪里逃啊？
- Fight or run? - Run where?

197
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,600
射它们的眼睛！
Aim for the eyes!

198
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,140
威廉！
William!

199
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,560
畜生！来啊！
Hey! Bitch!

200
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,140
- 威廉 - 引狼入室
- William. - I need a shot.

201
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,240
什么神 造出了这些怪物？
What god made those things?

202
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,260
反正不是我们的神
None that we know.

203
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,180
- 他们还会处死我们吗？ - 哪倒省事了
- Think they'll hang us now? - I could use the rest.

204
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,980
- 听说 今天打得不错 - 我们殿帅 在夸奖你们
- You fought well today. - You've earned General Shao's praise.

205
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,840
- 它们会回来吗？ - 会的
- Will they come back? - Yes.

206
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,540
我们得随时准备好
All we can do is prepare.

207
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,460
带他们回营房
Take them to the barracks.

208
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,780
- 给他们准备一个房间 - 是！
- They need rest. - Yes!

209
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,620
感谢救命之恩
Thank you for saving my life.

210
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,940
林将军
Commander Lin.

211
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,520
你从小 在禁军中长大
You grew up in the Nameless Order.

212
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,360
我也教会了你很多东西
I've taught you many things,

213
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,000
你也在不断的学习
and you have been learning,

214
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,840
但是它们也在学习
but they have been learning also.

215
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,300
王军师说过 它们在变化
Strategist Wang warned they are evolving.

216
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,120
我们没有认真听
No one listened.

217
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,020
我们今天 面对的对手
The enemies we're facing today

218
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,400
已经不是六十年前的敌人了
are more intelligent than 60 years ago.

219
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,060
盯紧那两个外邦
Watch the foreigners closely.

220
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,760
姑且好生款待
They can never leave.

221
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,600
- 一旦查明实情 立即处死 - 遵命！
- We must protect the secrets of the Wall. - Yes sir!

222
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,660
你是谁啊？
Who are you?

223
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,400
等一下
Easy.

224
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,860
我叫巴拉德
I'm Ballard.

225
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,020
我叫威廉
William.

226
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,500
他是托瓦尔
This is Tovar.

227
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,240
你们来干嘛？
What are you doing here?

228
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,320
- 当然是为了黑火药了 - 果然不出我所料
- We came looking for black powder. - I bet you did.

229
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:52,600
25年前 我随一队雇佣兵来到这里
I came with merceneries for the same thing, 25 years ago.

230
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,360
也是为了这个？
And did you find it?

231
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,980
- 你找到了吗？ - 找到了和活着带出去 可是两回事
Finding it and leaving with it alive are two different things.

232
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,600
不过 你们参加了战斗 就等于是先下了步好棋
You saved the west turret. That was extremely diplomatic.

233
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,520
杀死怪兽 不是下棋
We weren't being diplomatic.

234
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,440
是为了保命
We were trying to stay alive.

235
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,040
- 你们身上的味道 像牲口 - 多谢
- You smell like animals. - Thank you.

236
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:22,980
洗干净 会给你们饭吃
Clean up and they'll feed you.

237
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,080
他知道 黑火药在哪里
He knows where the powder is.

238
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,940
那他怎么还在这里？
Then why is he still here?

239
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,260
他需要我们当帮手？
He needs help getting out?

240
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,100
可能
Right.

241
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,200
那就将计就计
We play our part,

242
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,900
拿了火药 就回家
take the powder and go home.

243
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,380
- 你好像漏了一件大事？ - 什么大事？
- I didn't sign up for this. - Which part?

244
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,140
怪兽啊 白天那事 还不够大啊
Well... All of it. But mostly the monsters.

245
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,080
的确是不小
There's a lot of them.

246
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,860
我们真的很臭
We really do smell.

247
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,420
欢迎贵客光临
General Shao welcomes you as honored guests

248
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,380
我们邵殿帅
of the Nameless Order,

249
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,600
感谢你们参加战斗 并赞赏你们勇气可嘉
and thanks you for your skill and courage.

250
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:42,020
我们荣幸的荣幸
We are honored to be honored.

251
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,320
话都不会说了？
Is that the best you've got?

252
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,740
殿帅
General.

253
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,580
我们见过他的兵器
I couldn't help wondering,

254
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,320
想不通 像他这样一位神箭手
why would such an accomplished archer

255
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:00,160
为何 会用这样一张破弓？
used such a primitive bow.

256
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:06,180
陈将军认为 你的弓 跟你身手不相配
Commander Chen thinks your bow is not worthy of your skill.

257
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,620
告诉他 这张弓 无与伦比
Tell him there's no better weapon here.

258
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:12,640
他说 这张弓 全城 独一无二
He claims his weapon is second to none.

259
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,020
让他给我们展示一下 让将士们开开眼！
Let him show us. Give him some space!

260
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,980
- 大家想领教一下 - 在这里？
- They wish to see you shoot. - In here?

261
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:33,920
众目睽睽 要是为难 就算了
Unless he's afraid. It's a large audience.

262
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,060
- 什么意思？ - 他说 当着这么多人
- What was that? - He thinks you have fear.

263
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,320
你怕出丑
Too many people.

264
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,640
- 你拿一只碗来 - 真练啊？
- Get one of the cups. - Now?

265
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,780
- 去拿一只碗来 - 我都快饿死了
- Get one of the cups. - I want to eat.

266
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,180
照老样子？上次 你可演砸了
You remember how to do this? Last Time didn't go so good.

267
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,520
- 那是喝醉了 - 多醉？
- We were drunk. - How high?

268
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,720
十码 向右 六掌
10 yards. Six hands to the right.

269
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,740
- 行不行啊 - 没事 就这么来
- Turn around. - No. I'll do it this way.

270
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,840
- 听我口令 - 我说 伙计…
- On my count. - Amigo...

271
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,700
一
One.

272
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,600
二
Two.

273
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,660
三
Three.

274
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,660
扔
Pull.

275
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,020
臭美够了吧 我可得开始吃了
Good luck with that. I want food.

276
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,880
- 这里还有外国人？ - 你说巴拉德？
- Who taught you English? - Sir Ballard.

277
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,940
他来了很久了
English and Latin.

278
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,180
听说 都已经25年了
Heard he's been here for twenty five years.

279
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,900
你们一直扣留他
You won't let him leave.

280
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,530
他必须留下
He must stay here.

281
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,420
那我们呢？
What about us?

282
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,480
轻松一点吃 一顿都少不了你的
Pace yourself. The meals are regular here.

283
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,880
我可没想 像你待那么久
I hope not to stay that long.

284
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,580
这么想就对了
I like your thinking,

285
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,560
我劝你 还是别让人看出来 你想干嘛
but I suggest you keep your plans private.

286
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,260
你们不是唯一 为了黑火药而来的西方人
You aren't the first Westerners to come here looking for black powder.

287
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:31,280
今晚来我的房间 商量一下
We'll discuss it tonight. Bring your partner.

288
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,500
- 你在这里多久了？ - 一直都在
- How long have you been here? - Always.

289
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,520
我不到五岁的时候 就来这里了
I was not five years old when I came here.

290
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,560
我从小 就没有家
I have no other family.

291
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,960
那我们是同类人
We're the same.

292
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,420
我也是被军队收养的 在我记事之前
I was given to an army before I can remember.

293
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,600
- 当了士兵？ - 不是 一名打扫
- As a soldier? - Worse. As a gleaner.

294
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,720
就是一群孩子  在战斗结束之后 负责打扫战场
Packs of children, we'd clean the battlefields.

295
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,580
后来成了侍卫
After, when the fighting's over, I became a page.

296
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:59,140
- 一名长茅兵 - 为了你的国家？
- a pikeman's boy. - For Your country?

297
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,120
不 为了填饱肚子
No. I fought for food.

298
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,500
为了生存
You fight to eat.

299
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,620
也是为了钱而战
You live long enough, you fight for money.

300
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,800
你可以为任何国家卖命？
How many flag do you fight for?

301
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,260
我不确定
I don't know.

302
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,200
我帮哈罗德 打丹麦人
I fought for Harold against the Danes.

303
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,560
救了公爵的命 他死之前 我一直替他打战
I saved a Duke's life. I fought for him until he died.

304
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,520
我帮西班牙人 打法兰克人
Fought for Spain against the Franks.

305
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,120
又帮法兰克人 打布伦人
Fought for Franks against Boulogne.

306
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,680
还为教皇打过仗
I fought for the Pope.

307
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,120
很多国家
Many flags.

308
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,760
我们并不是同类人
We are not the same.

309
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,280
来城墙上找我 让你见识一下
Meet me on the Wall. I have something to show you.

310
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,880
这个女人 你得防着一点
He should be careful with her.

311
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,520
她可不是省油的灯
She's very powerful here.

312
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,800
正好 我们也不省油
Then it is a fair contest.

313
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,560
上来
Come.

314
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,080
敢不敢试试？
You wish to try?

315
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,420
男人那么重 拉得上来吗？
Men are too heavy. Do you think we can pull him up?

316
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,130
她说 男人可以做很好的示范
She says men have so much to teach us.

317
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,440
我觉得 她说的 不是这个意思
I don't think that's what she said.

318
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,040
我看出来了？
You know what I think?

319
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,860
你是怕出丑了
I think you're afraid.

320
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,480
射箭前 你也这么说
You said that this morning.

321
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,500
我这不是…
And yet,

322
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,960
来了吗？
here I am.

323
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:56,920
好啊
Yes.

324
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,600
那来吧
Here you are.

325
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,160
你是跳？还是不跳？
Will you jump? Or not?

326
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:23,960
- 他们靠得住吗？ - 这你不用操心
- These men know what they're doing? - Wrong question.

327
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:32,780
你该操心的是  你身上的绳子 绑好了没有
Whether or not the cable is attached, that is the question.

328
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,580
- 关键是？ - 信任
- And the answer? - Xin ren.

329
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,160
信任？
Xin ren?

330
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:46,280
信任 彼此之间 相信
Xin ren means trust. To have faith.

331
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:52,720
我们这支军队  不为钱和食物而战
Here, in this army, we fight for more than food or money.

332
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,290
我们的牺牲 更有意义
We give our lives to something more.

333
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:02,260
我们以信任为旗帜 彼此支持 相互信任
Xin ren is our flag. Trust in each other.

334
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,400
不论何时 不论何地
In all ways, at all times.

335
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,200
你说的有道理 但我还是不跳
Well, that's all well and good, but I'm not jumping.

336
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,090
我能活到今天 就因为 只信自己
I'm alive today because I trust no one.

337
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,640
其实 你信任别人 就是相信自己
A man must learn to trust, before he can be trusted.

338
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,860
你说的对
Then you were right.

339
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,960
我们不是同类人
We're not the same.

340
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,500
快！下次袭击 随时开始！
Stay vigilant! The next attack is coming!

341
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,200
我的天！
My god!

342
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,420
让你们先开开眼
A taste, a glimpse,

343
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,260
这点黑火药
a few pilfered grains

344
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,340
还是我从王军师哪里 偷偷弄来的 很珍贵
from Strategist Wang's supply of black powder.

345
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,720
王军师这个人 对黑火药 可是很有研究
He's mastered the transmutation of these elements.

346
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,400
据说有种火药武器
People speak of a weapon.

347
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,200
这里的武器 五花八门
There are many weapons here.

348
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,580
我怎么没见到啊？
Why have we not seen them?

349
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,400
你没见过的东西多着呢
There are many things you have not seen.

350
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,380
你应该祷告
And many things you should pray

351
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,440
打仗的时候 千万别碰到它 否则 你就玩完了
will not be needed before the siege is through.

352
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,680
饕餮还会回来的
The Tao Tei will return.

353
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,360
当战鼓响起的时候
When the drums call to battle,

354
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,840
全体将士 上城墙 各就各位
the guards leave their post and take their positions on the Wall.

355
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:34,760
那就是我们逃跑的机会
That is our moment.

356
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,600
只要他们一打起来… 我们就开溜
We want to be riding away as the battle rages.

357
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:43,420
那火药仓库的门呢？
And the armory doors?

358
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:47,000
- 你有钥匙？ - 黑火药 我这里还有
- You have keys? - I have black powder,

359
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,300
够炸开好几道门的
enough for several doors.

360
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,240
我们互相协作 各取所需 离开这里
He brings us in. We get us out.

361
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,360
王军师有请诸位
Strategist Wang request your presence.

362
00:37:56,330 --> 00:38:00,020
你搏斗时  这块石头 到底在哪里？
As you fought, where was this stone?

363
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,080
在我包里
In my bag.

364
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,520
真是无形的力量
Its unseen force is powerfull.

365
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,620
看来 得好好研究一下这块石头
I believe this strange stone could help us.

366
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,840
玄机何在
We try everything.

367
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,460
- 饕餮现在在哪里？ - 钩吾山 准备攻击
- Where are the Tao Tei now? - The mountains, regrouping.

368
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,010
它们从哪里来的？
Where do they come from?

369
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,280
在2000多年前
About 20 centuries ago,

370
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:30,240
有一位皇帝 贪婪无度 令民不聊生
There was an emperor whose greed brought deep suffering to all of China.

371
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,820
激怒上苍 天降陨石 击中钩吾山
The heaven sent a meteor that struck Gouwu Mountain

372
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:36,640
绿光中 释放出饕餮
turning it green and releasing Tao Tei.

373
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,420
从此 中国北方的土地上  六十年 一个轮回
From that day on, the Tao Tei rise every sixty years,

374
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,700
几经饕餮的肆虐
to scourge the north of China.

375
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:49,220
以此告诫世人 贪婪的后果
They come to remind us of what happens when greed is unchecked.

376
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,280
饕餮兵兽 见人就吃 无论生死
They eat anything, alive or dead,

377
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:59,160
只是为了去填饱兽王的肚皮
and take food to their queen. She depends on her soldiers to feed her.

378
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:04,100
饕餮兽王不捕食 全靠兵兽喂养它 兽王吃饱了 就会大量的繁殖
Only with the food they provide is she able to multiply.

379
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,960
离长城八百里以外的汴梁
The capital and its 2 million people,

380
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:12,100
那里有两百万的人口
is only 800 li away.

381
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,460
如果这两百万的人口 变成他们充足的食物
If the Tao Tei ever had that much nourisment

382
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,620
那么天下 将永无宁日
no corner of the world would be safe.

383
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:24,100
- 为什么不去杀了它们？ - 当然试过 他们去了
- You cann't hunt them? - Men try. They disappear.

384
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:26,140
一个也没回来
We never find their bones.

385
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:31,720
绍殿帅 紧急巡查西箭楼！
Troops unaccounted for at the West Tower!

386
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,840
它们为何丢下尸体？
Why did they leave the bodies?

387
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,040
下马！
Dismount!

388
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,180
建阵！
Formation!

389
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,280
前进！
Advance!

390
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,840
停一下
Stop.

391
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,780
林将军
Commander Lin.

392
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,460
殿帅…
General...

393
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,220
它们又进步了
They led us into a trap.

394
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,840
懂得偷袭我们的要害了
We underestimated their intelligence.

395
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,000
禁军…
The Nameless Order...

396
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,520
- 就交给你了 - 殿帅…
- is yours to command. - General...

397
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,480
众将军 听令…
Commanders, this is my final order...

398
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,840
从今天起
from this day forward,

399
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:22,240
林将军 就是你们的殿帅
Commander Lin will lead you.

400
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:28,300
禁军全体将士 愿接受林将军的率领
The soldiers of the Nameless Order will stand firm.

401
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,320
保家卫国！誓灭饕餮！
The wall must not fall! We will defeat the Tao Tei!

402
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:37,420
- 请殿帅放心！ - 请殿帅放心！
- Rest in peace. - Rest in peace!

403
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:31,220
秦时明月 汉时关

404
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:43,220
万里长征 人未还

405
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:53,220
但使龙城 飞将在

406
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:12,120
不叫胡马 渡阴山

407
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,140
枢密院特使 沈大人
This is envoy Shen from the palace.

408
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,920
他特地从汴梁带来史料 协助我们对付饕餮
He has brought important records to help with the coming battle.

409
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:27,360
- 据九百多年前史料记载 - 九百年前的史料上写道
- This is a 900 years old batte report. - A 900 years old battle report.

410
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:33,160
当年在寒沙门  有三只饕餮 爬上了城楼
At the Hans Gate, three beasts mounted the wall.

411
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,580
越过城楼 沿途杀了很多人
They killed many men as they went forward.

412
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:41,220
但是 也许是天上神的力量
Then, by the grace of the ancient gods,

413
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,120
饕餮 突然停了下来
the beasts stopped

414
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,910
静止不动了  士兵上前 将其斩杀
and sat peacefully, as we slaughtered them.

415
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:53,240
当时现场有一块磁石 跟这一块一样
There was a magnet on site just like this one.

416
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,020
当年在寒沙门  也有一块 像这样的磁石
At the Hans Gate, was a magnet just like this one.

417
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:02,580
他说 是因为你身上的这块磁石
I believe that magnet was the reason the two of you Westerners

418
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:04,940
你才能轻而易举地 把那只饕餮杀死了
killed the Tao Tei so easily.

419
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:09,600
他觉得是磁石 让饕餮的耳朵聋了
I believe the magnet makes the Tao Tei deaf.

420
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,060
饕餮听不到兽王的指令  就静止了
Without instruction, they fall still.

421
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,540
- 此事如何验证？ - 确实难以验证
- How to prove that? - How can we be sure?

422
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,020
试试就行？
Why not try it?

423
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,960
只要抓一只饕餮 测试一下
Capture a Tao Tei. See if it works.

424
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:28,600
- 他说他要尝试一下 就得抓一只 - 怎么抓？
- He wants to try. He wants to catch one. - How?

425
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:30,760
根本没有那么结实的网
No net is strong enough.

426
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:34,860
直接抓 就像捕鲸 你知道我在说什么
Hunt them. Like a whale. You know what that is.

427
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,800
是一种水中的巨兽 可比饕餮大百十倍
A water beast. A hundred times the size of a Tao Tei.

428
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,860
用带勾的叉 勾住它 钩住骨头
A spear that grabs. Hook the bone.

429
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:44,100
然后 把它拉上来
Pulled them up.

430
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,960
用有钩的鱼叉  直接就可以把它抓住
Use a spear, hook them. So we can catch them.

431
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,640
我在西班牙见过
I've seen it done in Spain.

432
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:53,560
他说 他在西班牙见过
He claims to have seen it done in Spain.

433
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,280
你跟着瞎搅合什么啊？
What the hell are you doing?

434
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:59,500
只要他们一打起来 我们就得逃
We need to be free when the attack comes.

435
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,380
这可是唯一的机会？
How many chances do you think we will get?

436
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,900
装受伤 玩失踪 做个胆小鬼 行吗？
Be injured. Be missing. Be a coward.

437
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:08,980
别再瞎掺和了
Get out of this.

438
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:11,840
我们够意思了
We did enough.

439
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,520
你们要调稠一点 才能麻醉它
The mixture must be strong to put the creature to sleep.

440
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,300
- 把麻药涂匀了 - 是！
- Spread it on evenly. - Yes, Commander!

441
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:09,900
楞什么？
Snap out of it!

442
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:30,300
给我滚到伙房去 不要再上来！
Useless idiot! report to the kitchen where you belong!

443
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,280
- 遵命 - 滚！
- Yes, Commander. - Go!

444
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:08,380
- 他会来的 - 什么时候？等打完仗？
- He'll be here. - When? When it was over?

445
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:11,180
- 那我们边干边等 - 边干边等？
- We will start and he will find us. - Start?

446
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:15,120
开弓没有回头箭 我把一切都准备好了
We're jumping off a cliff here. I have everything.

447
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,410
火药 工具 地图
Powder, tools, maps.

448
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,260
都藏在逃跑的沿途
It's all hidden and arranged along the route.

449
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,300
一旦动手 根本没时间等他
Once we start, there's no going back.

450
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,500
- 敢死队 上！ - 是！敢死队上！
- Death Squad ready! - Yes! Death Squad go!

451
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,560
大刀准备！
Blades ready!

452
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:27,960
大刀起！
Blades forward!

453
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:29,360
- 攻击！ - 上！
- Attack! - Go!

454
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:38,260
- 左！左！ - 右！右！
Left! Right!

455
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,280
- 我去找他 - 甭管他了
- I'll find him. - Forget him.

456
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:12,340
他现在 一心只想着讨好那个女殿帅
He'd rather die trying to impress the new general

457
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:16,860
你说 等拿到火药 有了钱 什么妞不能玩啊？
than grab the key to every counting room and brothel in the world.

458
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:21,340
- 不能再等了 现在就得行动 - 不能扔下他
Good God, man. The time is now. I can't go without him.

459
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:24,640
- 少一个人分钱 不是更好！ - 我们需要他的弓！
- More the spoils for us! - We need his bow!

460
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:29,620
鱼叉箭！
Harpoons!

461
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,900
- 鱼叉箭 放！ - 是！鱼叉箭 放！
- Harpoons, Now! - Yes! Harpoons, fire!

462
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,000
齐放！
Fire!

463
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:19,720
去！
There!

464
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,940
- 让开！ - 最后一根了！
- Move! - It's the last one!

465
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,480
- 再拉！ - 不 不 不 停！
- Pull! - No, no, no. Stop!

466
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:50,930
停一下！
Hold!

467
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,940
你们拉得太紧！ 链子会断的
There's too much tension! Chain will break.

468
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,700
- 先松一下 先松一下 - 慢点！慢点！
- That way. That way. - Let him run!

469
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:04,820
停！停！我们得等一下 等麻药起作用了
Stop! Stop! We need longer for the sleeping potion to work.

470
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:11,180
拉 拉起来
That way. That way.

471
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:15,140
得想办法 挡开其他饕餮
We need to isolate it. Sparate it from the others.

472
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:18,100
- 火球保护！ - 是！火球保护！
- Ring of Fire! - Yes! Ring of Fire!

473
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:38,380
- 铁链要断了！ - 不好啦！
- The chain won't hold much longer! - We're losing him!

474
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:49,900
- 威廉 等等 响箭！ - 是！响箭！
- William, wait. Screaming arrows! - Yes! Screaming arrows!

475
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:53,760
中了响箭的饕餮 一跑就会响
These arrows will scream as the Tao Tei run.

476
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,100
瞄准声音射箭
Aim for the sound.

477
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,900
火球圈内 响箭覆盖！
Aim inside the circle. Blanket the whole area.

478
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:17,420
放！
Fire!

479
00:53:58,540 --> 00:53:59,640
收！
Pull!

480
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:24,780
救你一命 是因为 我想亲手宰了你
I'm only saving you so I can kill you myself.

481
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:28,300
捡把斧头 盲打
Grab the axe, we're fighting blind.

482
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,700
- 可能现在做不是… - 你少废话！
- Not yet! - I know what to do!

483
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:13,560
- 火焰挡不住它们了 - 那就永别吧 兄弟
- The fire is not holding them back here. - Die well, brother.

484
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,140
- 你在干嘛？ - 给她发信号！
- What the hell are you doing? - She's listening.

485
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:29,580
- 火药箭 霹雳弹准备！ - 是 火药箭 霹雳弹准备！
- Prepare black powder weapon! - Prepare black powder weapon!

486
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,740
佩戴火绳！
Prepare to light the fuses!

487
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:39,380
是！佩戴火绳！
Yes! Prepare to light the fuses!

488
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,460
- 成功了？ - 是的
- Did it work? - Yes.

489
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,400
抓了只活的
The beast was captured.

490
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:12,900
- 那我朋友呢？ - 放心 他没事
- My friend... - He was unharmed.

491
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,600
你为什么要跳下去？
Why did you go over the Wall?

492
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:36,000
信任 我说的 对吗？
Xin ren. Did I say that right?

493
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,160
谢谢你
Thank you.

494
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:49,260
我们的黑火药
Black powder.

495
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:52,960
是一种可怕的武器
It is a terrible weapon.

496
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:57,980
我真希望你 不曾见过这一切
It would be better if you had never see it.

497
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,420
我对外面的世界 了解的并不是很多
I know very little of the outside world.

498
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:11,280
在我看来  人类与饕餮的贪婪 并无区别
But it seems to me, the greed of men is not that different than the Tao Tei.

499
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,380
我说的 对吗？
Is that true?

500
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:16,840
全都是弱肉强食
The strong take what they want.

501
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:30,400
忘掉你所看到的一切
Forget what you have seen.

502
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:23,320
好！即刻押送汴梁
Excellent! Send it to the capital immediately.

503
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:25,880
不可！需就地研究
No! We need to study it here.

504
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:28,880
饕餮若能活捉 皇上必须先睹
If a Tao Tei is captured alive, it must be sent to the emperor.

505
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,440
下官特地为此事而来 这可是皇上的旨意
This is an Imperial Order.

506
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:57,340
你会成为一个勇敢的士兵
You're much braver than they think.

507
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:27,440
没受伤吧？
You're wounded?

508
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,880
刚才我在找你
I was looking for you.

509
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:34,700
是想跟你说 谢谢你
To say thank you.

510
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:44,560
感觉特别好吧？ 想不想唱两句啊？
You feel good, huh? Maybe you sing a little song, eh?

511
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:47,500
要不 一起唱
I will join you.

512
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:51,280
歌颂一个伟大的英雄 拯救了中国人
We can sing together how you saved the gratefull Chinos.

513
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:53,780
干嘛这么说  一切你都看到了？
You saw what happened out there, and that's what you say?

514
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,140
我看到了黑火药
I see black powder.

515
01:00:56,540 --> 01:01:00,680
- 也看到 你忘了朋友 - 放心吧 黑火药又不会跑
- I see a man forget his friends. - The black powder's not going anywhere.

516
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:02,760
我看 不会跑的是你
What goes nowhere is you.

517
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:08,640
你永远都得不到你想要的
You'll never get what you want from this.

518
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:12,300
你以为 他们能把你当大英雄啊？
You think they see you as some kind of hero?

519
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:16,660
想当救世主？你蒙得了他们
A man of virtue? Maybe you can fool them,

520
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,440
但是你蒙不了我
but I know what you are.

521
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:23,200
你心里 应该也很清楚
You know what you are.

522
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:27,400
你就是个贼 是个混混
A thief, a liar,

523
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,220
是个杀手
and a killer.

524
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:36,000
想放下屠刀 立地成佛？
You can never undo things you've done.

525
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:38,720
狗改不了吃屎
and you will never be anything.

526
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:48,500
这才像是我哥们
Good to see you again, amigo.

527
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:03,220
发现饕餮！发现饕餮！发现饕餮！
Tao Tei movement!

528
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:07,180
全体上城！全体上城！
All troops to the Wall!

529
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,480
- 人呢？ - 不管他了
- Nothing? - No.

530
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:13,620
- 你确定 他不会出卖我们？ - 不会的
- How do you know he won't betray us? - I don't.

531
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,200
他们会杀了他 不管怎么样都会
They'll kill him. They'll kill him no matter what.

532
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:17,820
他们杀他的时候
The time they spend killing him,

533
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,020
我们已经带着东西跑远了
is time they are not chasing us.

534
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:06,160
小心一点 这可有黑火药
Careful with that. There's powder here.

535
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:19,460
托瓦尔
Tovar.

536
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:54,280
殿帅 打通了！ 饕餮已突破长城！
General, it goes all the way through. Tao Tei have breached the wall.

537
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,180
它们居然如此狡猾
They're smarter than we thought.

538
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,220
- 传令所有将军 立即来此！ - 遵命！
- Summon my commanders immediately! - Yes, General!

539
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:22,100
去看看 是不是灭了
Have a look. See if it's gone out.

540
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:25,300
- 安全吗？ - 安全啊
- Is it safe? - Of course it is.

541
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:56,940
醒醒 开工了
Shake it off, man. To work.

542
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:01,880
安全？差点要了我的命
I thought you said it was safe?

543
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:04,620
结果 还是不错的
We're in, didn't we?

544
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:20,520
- 你来了 - 终于醒悟了啊？
- You're here. - We've come to our senses, eh?

545
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:23,600
他的计划很周密 逃出去 并不难
Ballard has planned well. Getting out is easy.

546
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:28,080
从这里往西 走二十英里后出长城
There's a gate. 20 miles west. We dodge the hill tribes.

547
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:32,800
- 只要我们避开契丹人 - 那就大功告成了
- We can make it. - They need us here.

548
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:34,180
这里需要我们
They need more than us.

549
01:05:35,910 --> 01:05:38,100
需要的人多了
- These people are doomed. - Don't be a fool.

550
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:39,520
- 留下来 就是个死 - 别傻了
I've been a fool.

551
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:40,900
我过去才傻 现在不会了
I'm done with it.

552
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,080
哥们 求你了
Brother, please.

553
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,060
过去的战斗 毫无意义
We've been fighting for nothing.

554
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,480
只是贪婪
For greed.

555
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:54,680
听我说 哥们  我们历尽千辛万苦 百般磨难
Amigo, after all the blood, the cold, and pain,

556
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:58,660
好不容易有了黑火药  目的达到了
with this black powder in our saddle bags, we win.

557
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:01,260
跟我们一起走吧
You come with me.

558
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:04,980
我不能这么做
I can't do that now.

559
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:09,960
- 留下来 跟我一起战斗 - 威廉…
- Stay and fight. - William...

560
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:17,980
- 他死了吗？ - 没那么容易死
- Think he's dead? - It'd take a lot more than that.

561
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:26,240
没想到 它们前两次 都是佯攻  我们都上当了
All of the attacks have been a diversion, while they dug this tunnel.

562
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:28,100
过了长城
They have breached the wall.

563
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:33,600
汴梁有它们无穷无尽的食物  后果不堪设想
Once they reach the capital, nothing in the world can stop them.

564
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:37,820
我的骑兵 就算是快马加鞭  也得两天 才能到汴梁
At a full gallop, it's two days to the capital.

565
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:42,140
- 它们肯定比我们快 - 现在风很强
- There's no way we can catch them. - The wind is strong now.

566
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:47,440
明天一整天吹北风 我们必须启用新发明
It blows from the north all day tomorrow. We have to use the balloons.

567
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:51,660
- 到汴梁要多久？ - 顺风约三个时辰
- If it works, how long to Bianliang? - Six hours if the wind hold.

568
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:53,200
如果能活着的话
If we make it alive.

569
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:57,300
殿帅 这些东西 从没试过
General, none of the tests have worked.

570
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:00,440
准备出发！
Get ready!

571
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:11,880
走！
Come on!

572
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:27,570
首都  汴梁
THE CAPITAL BIANLIANG

573
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:04,580
- 怎么抓的？ - 启禀皇上！
- How did you capture it? - Your Excellency!

574
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:09,800
皇上  是那块磁石 能制住这畜生
Your Excellency, It's the magnet. It keeps the beast under control.

575
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:14,540
自饕餮成祸以来 此发现 最为重大
This is the most important discovery in the history of the Tao Tei.

576
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:18,920
- 枢密院将立即展开研究 - 把他拉下来！
- We will investigate immediately. - Bring him here!

577
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:39,080
- 我试着… - 你还敢在此狡辩？
- I tried to stop... - You dare to speak to me?

578
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:45,140
- 这事不是我干的 - 是啊 你说 你是个商人
- I didn't do this. - And you came here to trade.

579
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,500
你并不是为了黑火药而来
And you knew nothing of black powder.

580
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:52,200
你一定觉得 我是个傻子 是吧
What a fool you must think I am.

581
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:56,220
如果我们是一伙的  我还会在这里吗？我是要阻止他们
If I was with them, why would I be here? I tried to stop them.

582
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:57,400
骗子！
Liar!

583
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,080
你是个骗子
You lie.

584
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,320
- 你心里知道 不是这样的 - 如果我不是殿帅
- Some part of you knows that's not true. - If I were not the General,

585
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,740
我会亲手杀了你
I would kill you myself.

586
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:11,980
殿帅！
General!

587
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:19,780
- 启禀殿帅 - 大声点！
- General. - Speak up.

588
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:26,100
事发时 小人正在翰渊阁 小人亲眼看见 他阻拦那两个人
I was there when it happened. I saw him try to stop them.

589
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,380
你确定吗？
Are you sure?

590
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:41,840
你敢说半句假话 我先铡了你！
If you're lying, I'll have your head!

591
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:45,400
小人以无影禁军的名誉起誓 所说 绝无半句虚言！
I swear on my vow to the Nameless Order!

592
01:09:59,710 --> 01:10:00,720
严加看管
Lock him up.

593
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:03,090
派骑兵队 把那两个盗贼抓回来！
Send the cavalry. Go after the two that got away.

594
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:03,900
遵命！
Yes, General.

595
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:29,720
往左 还是往右？
Which way, left or right?

596
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:32,980
得去高处看一下才知道
Go up and take a look from the high ground.

597
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:49,280
不！
No!

598
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:52,440
不！混蛋！
No! Bastard!

599
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,720
- 把牢方向！ - 是 把牢方向！
- Keep it steady! - Yes, General!

600
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:39,200
- 小心火药！ - 是 小心火药！
- Watch the powder! - Yes, General!

601
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:14,960
出什么事了？
What happened?

602
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:20,680
- 怎么了 军师？ - 我们失败了
What happened? We have failed.

603
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:23,520
饕餮已经越过长城
The Tao Tei are in the kingdom.

604
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:27,820
你自由了 想要什么 就拿上走吧
You are free to leave. Take what you wish and go.

605
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:31,460
- 这是殿帅最后的命令 - 她在哪里？
- This was the General's final order. - Where is she?

606
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,440
她去干什么？战斗？
To do what? To fight?

607
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:41,340
- 能打胜吗？ - 只有一种可能
- Is there a chance? - There's only one.

608
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:46,720
杀死兽王 兽王不死 我们都会死
Kill the Queen. Kill the Queen, or we all die.

609
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:51,300
回家吧 把你所看到的一切
Leave. Tell the world what you have seen,

610
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:53,940
告诉世人 大难将至
and tell them what is coming.

611
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,360
我的弓在哪里？
I'll need my bow.

612
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:24,420
我要和你们一起 参加战斗
If I'm to join you, I'll need my bow.

613
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:35,380
启禀军师！带上我
Strategist Wang! Please take me with you.

614
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:38,240
他想和我们一起去
He wishes to join us.

615
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:02,180
距离不同
The distance is the key.

616
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:05,240
这畜生的反应也不同
The magnet is only effective when close to the beast.

617
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:10,260
所以 磁石的远近
Therefore, the effect weakens as it gets further away.

618
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,260
才是研究的重点
You see I have it under complete control.

619
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:18,380
记下了 九尺
Write down nine feet.

620
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:10,120
- 往后飞 后殿！ - 是！后殿！
- Steer to the rear of the palace. - Yes! To the rear of the palace!

621
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:11,960
上面！
Above you!

622
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:22,980
- 霹雳弹！ - 是 霹雳弹！
- Light a grenade! - Yes, sir!

623
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:27,380
快接着！
Behind you!

624
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,840
我让你回家的
I set you free.

625
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:44,140
我还是来了
And here I am.

626
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,100
兽王在那里！
There's the queen!

627
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,300
它们在进食 不会进攻
They will not attack while the queen is feeding.

628
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:58,120
这是我们的机会！抓住！
We have a chance! Hold on!

629
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:13,320
来者何人？
State your purpose!

630
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,900
无影禁军 殿帅 林梅 参见皇上！
General Lin Mae from Nameless Order. At your service!

631
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:40,980
你们怎么回事？
What took you so long?

632
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,380
饕餮都冲到朕的门口了！
The Tao Tei overrun the city!

633
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:47,180
朕的几千御林军 还有无数的黎民百姓
Thousands of soldiers and innocent are dead.

634
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:49,200
一眨眼 全都没了！
You're too late!

635
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:51,420
被捕获的那个饕餮 现在在哪？
Where is the captured Tao Tei?

636
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,360
- 关地牢了！ - 要利用它杀死兽王
- In the dungeon! - We need it to kill the queen.

637
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,400
兽王死了 信号就断了
Once she is dead, The Tao Tei can not function.

638
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:59,320
成千上万的饕餮 就会僵住无用
Without her signal, their whole army will freeze.

639
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,500
这里有一条地下通道
There is an underground canal here.

640
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:22,820
没有饕餮吗？
Has it been breached?

641
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:25,440
现在 应该都在地上
The Tao Tei should all be above ground.

642
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:27,060
这是我们抓的那只？
And the one we captured?

643
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:28,540
带上它
We load it up.

644
01:19:29,450 --> 01:19:32,660
喂饱了以后 它会回去找兽王
We feed him. And it will return to its queen.

645
01:19:33,190 --> 01:19:34,120
好主意
Good.

646
01:20:43,270 --> 01:20:44,820
你会留下一个伤疤
You'll have one hell of a scar,

647
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:46,240
但是很酷
but you'll live.

648
01:20:46,820 --> 01:20:48,020
他说 你会活着
He says you will live.

649
01:20:48,740 --> 01:20:50,000
回头再救他
We'll come back for him.

650
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:09,990
它们攻进来了！
They've broken through!

651
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:35,030
威廉 别放箭
Patience, William.

652
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:54,660
它吃饱了之后 会去找兽王？
And it will go to the Queen when it's done?

653
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:56,710
应该会
It should.

654
01:22:59,260 --> 01:23:00,260
我确定
It will.

655
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:13,620
放它进去
Let it in.

656
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:38,480
我能从上面 把箭射进去
I can get a shot from above.

657
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:45,770
上去！我挡住它们
Go! I'll hold them back.

658
01:24:08,870 --> 01:24:10,670
快 它接近兽王了
Wait. Not yet.

659
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:19,700
中
Hit.

660
01:24:29,140 --> 01:24:31,510
再上 它们护不住头顶
Go higher. I'll get a better shot.

661
01:24:44,590 --> 01:24:47,350
殿帅！全靠你们了！
General! It's up to you now!

662
01:25:40,030 --> 01:25:43,300
只剩一件火药武器了 把火药枪给我
We have one black powder weapon left. Give me the spear.

663
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:47,200
我苦练一生 只为此战
I've trained for this my whole life.

664
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:50,030
信任
Trust.

665
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:55,830
我们相互信任
I'll get you the shot.

666
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:42,580
抓紧我！
I've got you.

667
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:02,960
怎么样 有没有想我啊？
So, how's life without me?

668
01:28:03,990 --> 01:28:04,980
有一点无聊
A little slow.

669
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:11,830
- 听说 你是大英雄了 - 那是必须的
- You're a hero after all. - Oh, it looks that way.

670
01:28:12,030 --> 01:28:13,790
瞧你得意的样子
You seem pleased with yourself..

671
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:16,300
拯救世界的大英雄 有什么奖励？
And what are they giving you for all your troubles?

672
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:18,600
一袋金子？
A bag of gold?

673
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:21,280
还是在长城上 为你嘉喜庆典？
A victory parade along the top of the Wall?

674
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:23,150
黑火药 我随便拿
All the black powder I can carry.

675
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:26,470
而且派骑兵 保护我回家
And a cavalry escort to get me home safely.

676
01:28:27,910 --> 01:28:29,680
- 那恭喜你了 - 谢谢
- Well, congratulations. - Thank you.

677
01:28:31,230 --> 01:28:32,390
所以 你就？
So what is this?

678
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:35,920
- 跟我这显摆？ - 那当然啦？
- You're here to rub my nose in it? - Well, would you blame me?

679
01:28:36,350 --> 01:28:38,470
你上次 把我一个人扔下来等死
The last time I saw you, you left me for dead.

680
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:40,360
再上次 我还救你一条命呢
And the time before, I saved your life.

681
01:28:40,790 --> 01:28:41,580
倒也是
True.

682
01:28:44,230 --> 01:28:46,350
其实 皇上给我两个选择
You know, the Emperor gave me a choice.

683
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:50,470
带走黑火药…或着带走你
I could take the black powder or I could take you.

684
01:28:53,630 --> 01:28:55,390
那你可千万别选我
Please tell me you chose the powder.

685
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:04,350
你让我很失望啊
I don't even know you anymore.

686
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:10,420
马已经备好了 日落前 我们就可以出发
The horses are saddled and waiting. Best we ride before nightfall.

687
01:29:16,710 --> 01:29:17,740
我回避
I'll be inside.

688
01:29:18,350 --> 01:29:19,600
走时 可记得叫我啊
Don't leave without me.

689
01:29:30,790 --> 01:29:32,240
我是来道别的
I came to say goodbye.

690
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:37,110
听说你 荣升骠骑大将军了
I understand congratulations are in order.

691
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,950
我真的 很为你感到高兴
General of the northwest territory.

692
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:42,140
应该祝贺你
Quite an honor.

693
01:29:44,550 --> 01:29:46,280
看来 你已经选择好了
Seems you've made your choice.

694
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:50,840
他啊？说实话  我真的想用这小子换黑火药
Oh, him? Believe me, I'm already think about trading him back for the powder.

695
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:52,580
我可听着呢
I heard that.

696
01:29:58,780 --> 01:30:00,780
也许 我们都说得不对
Perhaps we were both wrong.

697
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:04,350
其实 我们就是一类人
We are more similar than I thought.

698
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:11,830
谢谢大将军
Thank you General.

699
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:42,200
- 你不想留下来陪她？ - 当然想啊
- Are you sure you don't want to go back? - Of course I do.

700
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:45,280
但我怕你一个人 回不了家
I just don't trust you to make it out of here alone.
