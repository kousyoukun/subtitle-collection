00:01:13,016 --> 00:01:15,228
I'm Jane DeLuca, this is Johnny Figgis, and our band.

4
00:01:13,633 --> 00:01:16,557
I'm going to take a leak, Babe.

5
00:01:17,831 --> 00:01:18,674
Bye.

6
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,839
Did you see that bitch, man?

7
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:22,176
Fuck her.

8
00:01:22,236 --> 00:01:23,708
I'm going to fuck her!

9
00:01:23,905 --> 00:01:25,285
Wait!  J...J...Jane!

10
00:01:28,695 --> 00:01:30,979
Girl, that man is so fine!

11
00:01:31,454 --> 00:01:32,939
Yeah, actually he is.

12
00:01:33,045 --> 00:01:34,490
Is this your first date?

13
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:37,956
Listen, do you need to clear something?
Go ahead and take everything, just leave us the glasses.

14
00:01:39,534 --> 00:01:43,534
No, I was the singer up there.  You didn't see me?
I was like signaling and going like this to you.

15
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,817
What are you talking about?

16
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:51,230
You don't know?  Oh Baby!  You had the biggest, greenest
thing hanging out of your nose, so I kept going like this.

17
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:53,867
Oh my God.  You could see it from up there?

18
00:01:54,137 --> 00:01:57,290
Baby, it looked like Gumby doing Tarzan.  It was huge!

19
00:01:57,268 --> 00:01:58,243
Oh my God!  All right.

20
00:01:58,665 --> 00:02:02,665
You blew my rent, man!  I had an important A &R guy coming down
and you fucked me! You're outta here!  You're canceled!  Forget it!

21
00:02:05,857 --> 00:02:07,415
No, you can't...Hey, wait!

22
00:02:07,724 --> 00:02:10,441
Wait for what?  Till you learn to sing?

23
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:12,115
What's up with him?  What did he want?

24
00:02:12,245 --> 00:02:14,125
You wanna know what's up with him?
That son-of-a-bitch just fucked us!

25
00:02:16,368 --> 00:02:20,210
You know, this town is dead for me anyway.
We got that gig in L.A., we'll just leave a little early.

26
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,816
Yeah, well maybe this is trying to telling us something.
You know what I'm saying?

27
00:02:23,816 --> 00:02:26,404
Yeah, it's telling us we're fucking fired!
That's what it's telling us.

28
00:02:26,092 --> 00:02:28,603
Well, no, not just this.  I mean, maybe L.A.
isn't the answer to our problems.

29
00:02:30,177 --> 00:02:32,023
Well, what does that mean?

30
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,759
Tommy hooked me up with some studio work in the city.  It's good money.
It's in the city.  And I've got to think of Debbie here, you know?

31
00:02:37,837 --> 00:02:41,837
Oh, Debbie?  Isn't that the little girl in Queens who
sets her hair everyday, this is suddenly a factor?

32
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:46,269
Yo!  Get the fuck outta the way!

33
00:02:46,886 --> 00:02:49,064
You get the fuck out of my way!
Do you understand?  Go back to Pakistan!

34
00:02:51,493 --> 00:02:55,493
Look, I've gotta be realistic here.  I've got to look ahead.
I mean, how long have you've been doing this shit?  What, for 17 years?

35
00:02:58,965 --> 00:03:01,160
Look, what?  Look, what?!

36
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,480
I don't want that to happen to me, okay?

37
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:05,723
You should be so lucky!

38
00:03:05,538 --> 00:03:07,498
Hey, I got priorities here, you know!

39
00:03:09,384 --> 00:03:13,384
You know, she's holding you back, man.
Everybody says it.  She's like Yoko with bangs!

40
00:03:14,346 --> 00:03:16,390
They don't say that she's holding me back, okay?

41
00:03:17,369 --> 00:03:21,369
Look.  All I'm saying is, don't go to L.A.  I mean, even if you don't
got shit going on here, you still got all that voice-over stuff...

42
00:03:23,428 --> 00:03:24,605
Let me tell you something, man.  You stay here.
You stay here and you play daddy, okay?  I'm gone.

43
00:03:30,326 --> 00:03:32,608
Jane!

44
00:04:17,755 --> 00:04:20,140
That was in '78.  I was supposed to be
the new Aretha, but the old Aretha

45
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,179
was the new Aretha and I was neither one,
so I was something that no one had ever seen before.

46
00:04:25,395 --> 00:04:26,202
Sure.

47
00:04:26,063 --> 00:04:28,147
- So I'm gettin' the fuck out!
- Could I get some french fries, please?

48
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:31,614
You know, head down to L.A., get some
gigs going, get the heat happening.

49
00:04:32,746 --> 00:04:36,070
Well, great.  That's perfect because I can drop you there,
and then head on to San Diego on my own.

50
00:04:37,252 --> 00:04:38,052
Great.

51
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:40,039
You know, I used to sing, too.

52
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:40,749
Oh really?

53
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,501
Nothing professional.  Mostly amateur talent competitions.

54
00:04:44,786 --> 00:04:46,338
"Oh, ""Star Search"" or something?"

55
00:04:45,826 --> 00:04:49,716
Sort of.  Only I never made it that far.
I played the piano and sang.

56
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:52,980
What did you sing?

57
00:04:53,234 --> 00:04:57,234
"Way Over Yonder.  Carole King.  "
"Close to You.""  The Carpenters...  It was the seventies."

58
00:04:59,153 --> 00:05:00,182
Close to You?

59
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:04,759
"You know, why do birds suddenly appear every time
you appear, Just like me, they long to be..."

60
00:05:07,997 --> 00:05:10,512
Yeah, I know.  I know.  Why San Diego?

61
00:05:11,956 --> 00:05:15,846
"Why not?  I'm in real estate, and right now the market
is just unbelievably bad.  And sometimes you have to make a change.

62
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:24,287
You have to take control and say:  ""Things are going to be different.
I can make them different if I believe in them in my heart.""  "

63
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:34,456
"Hey, fuck ""Star Search.""  You should have been Miss America."

64
00:05:39,842 --> 00:05:43,362
Um, I hope you don't mind my mentioning this:  no smoking in the car.

65
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:47,939
What do you mean, no smoking?

66
00:05:45,424 --> 00:05:46,295
No smoking in the car.

67
00:05:46,537 --> 00:05:48,578
Whatsoever?

68
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,666
I'm going uptown.  Can I give you a lift?  Yoo hoo!  Taxi!

69
00:05:51,187 --> 00:05:52,930
No, I have a car.  One in which I smoke...

70
00:05:53,881 --> 00:05:57,573
So what do you think?  I think it could work.

71
00:05:56,168 --> 00:05:57,337
I'll let you know in a couple of days, okay?

72
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:58,884
Because I really need to leave, as soon
as possible, and I just

73
00:05:58,885 --> 00:05:59,372
don't want to it alone.  I don't think that would be safe.
And you're the first person that answered the ad.

74
00:05:59,373 --> 00:05:59,859
I think that's a sign of something.  I think you'd be fine.
I mean, I think our personalities would mesh.

75
00:06:15,302 --> 00:06:16,207
Look, Robin, right?
You're a nice lady and I'm sure

76
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:16,660
there's a lot of things about yourself that you just can't
help and I understand that.  But I

77
00:06:16,661 --> 00:06:16,887
don't fuckin' think we mesh at all.
And I'm sure there's somebody out there

78
00:06:16,888 --> 00:06:17,000
who wants to go cross country with the
whitest woman on the face of the earth,

79
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:17,113
singing Carpenter songs and reliving
childhood memories.  But it ain't me.

80
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:17,113
But it ain't me.  My car, man!  Hey!
That's my car!  Hey!  That's my car!

81
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:45,667
Hey! That's gonna cost at least $200 to get your car back.

82
00:07:05,089 --> 00:07:07,089
Okay, Jane.  Good luck in L.A., man.
Earthquakes, fires, riots...they got

83
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,089
some real crazy bastards out there in California.
I don't know why you want to go out there anyway.

84
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,089
Hey, easy with that piano!

85
00:08:31,786 --> 00:08:35,786
Good morning!

86
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:44,569
Listen, I've got a friend in Pittsburgh.  Do you mind if
we stop, pick her up and take her out for lunch?

87
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,666
No, absolutely.  No problem.  Deal.  Smile!

88
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,316
My brother threw up, right here, near Exit 7.
I remember, we pulled over.

89
00:09:32,814 --> 00:09:34,350
How come he's not making this trek with
you down memory lane?  Or does he have a life?

90
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,320
He doesn't, as a matter of fact.
He died of cancer when he was six.

91
00:09:42,235 --> 00:09:45,193
Oh, man.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Man.

92
00:09:46,665 --> 00:09:47,698
Would you mind if I used your headphones?

93
00:09:49,112 --> 00:09:52,196
No, go ahead.

94
00:10:04,273 --> 00:10:08,273
"Hi, you've reached Nick and Holly, leave a message...

95
00:10:16,052 --> 00:10:17,726
There's a sick lady in the bathroom.
Is she with somebody here?

96
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,474
She's outside.

97
00:10:24,575 --> 00:10:27,935
Is that your friend in there in the bathroom?

98
00:10:26,991 --> 00:10:27,791
Yeah.

99
00:10:28,176 --> 00:10:29,780
Girl, you better get in there.
She's in there throwin' up.

100
00:10:31,677 --> 00:10:32,595
Thanks.

101
00:10:38,817 --> 00:10:39,619
Hey, are you all right?

102
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,151
That stupid woman.
I told her I was fine.

103
00:10:44,247 --> 00:10:46,196
You look like shit.

104
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:50,199
Thank you.  Allergies.  I have allergies.  They come and they go.
Some people think it's all in my head.  Do you ever knock?

105
00:10:56,093 --> 00:11:00,093
Not in a public toilet, no.

106
00:11:00,688 --> 00:11:03,107
I'm really sorry.  It's probably because
I brought your brother up.

107
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:04,981
Oh, no no.  It's not that.  I'm fine.  I'll be fine if we
just keep moving.  It's not that...You smell like an ashtray.

108
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:35,996
I'm just goin' down to L.A. to...
What?!

109
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:43,129
Are you getting HBO?  Because we're supposed
to get HBO and it's not on mine.

110
00:11:43,891 --> 00:11:45,600
I don't know.  I'm on the phone here.

111
00:11:45,883 --> 00:11:46,971
Oh, I'm sorry.

112
00:11:47,033 --> 00:11:49,177
No, come in and check.  Come in.

113
00:11:51,763 --> 00:11:53,907
Yes, I'm on my way to L.A. and I thought
I'd stop by and see you...

114
00:11:56,032 --> 00:12:00,076
No, no, I said Tuesday or Wednesday.  Are you okay?
No, it's just...All right, no, I'll wait.

115
00:12:05,483 --> 00:12:08,991
"The Way We Were"" is on.  Robert Redford.
Barbara Streisand.  ""The Way We Were."""

116
00:12:11,992 --> 00:12:13,776
I don't get out much.

117
00:12:14,454 --> 00:12:16,499
It was twenty years ago.

118
00:12:19,362 --> 00:12:21,907
Oh great, you've got it.
Do you...do you mind?

119
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:24,803
No, please.  Please.

120
00:12:26,263 --> 00:12:29,282
No, I'm here.  No, I figured we'd come by
tomorrow around noon.  Are you okay?

121
00:12:33,463 --> 00:12:38,482
I mean, is it Nick?  No, fine, fine.  All right.
Yeah, no...I'll see you then.  Good-bye.

122
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:46,467
Is that your friend in Pittsburgh?

123
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,234
Yeah.  If she is still my friend.

124
00:12:50,112 --> 00:12:52,853
That's nice.  I don't really have any girlfriends.

125
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:57,714
My mom always felt, you know, you can't trust women.

126
00:12:58,242 --> 00:13:00,524
I don't know about that.

127
00:13:00,418 --> 00:13:03,456
Oh, come on.  Men know all about PMS.
Somebody talked.

128
00:13:32,851 --> 00:13:36,851
Oh!  That gets me the way she like brushes
his hair off his forehead.  That really gets me.

129
00:13:42,826 --> 00:13:46,826
So, which one of them were you?  The one who
loved too much or the one who loved too little?

130
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:52,600
Neither.  I'm the one who spent three years at Happy Hour
and never went home with anybody except the bartender.

131
00:13:55,218 --> 00:13:57,901
Well, the bartender is somebody.

132
00:13:57,818 --> 00:14:00,896
Yeah.  He was somebody, all right.

133
00:14:06,268 --> 00:14:10,846
I don't know about men.  I just don't get it.

134
00:14:13,074 --> 00:14:13,945
Maybe you're not into them.

135
00:14:15,528 --> 00:14:16,560
You mean...eew...no.

136
00:14:20,014 --> 00:14:21,777
Maybe you don't know.

137
00:14:22,334 --> 00:14:26,301
I think I scare them away because I know what I want.

138
00:14:25,891 --> 00:14:27,335
Oh well, tell me.  What do you want?

139
00:14:30,614 --> 00:14:32,798
It's not very liberated, I know...

140
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:41,214
I want a husband with a decent job, you know.

141
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:48,503
And, I want two kids, a boy and a girl, in that order,

142
00:14:52,832 --> 00:14:59,416
and a soap box colonial with three bedrooms, a sun porch,
a stairway with a white banister, and a convertible den.

143
00:15:04,962 --> 00:15:06,801
You could've been Donna Reed in another life.

144
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:10,721
Anyway, I didn't get it.

145
00:15:11,455 --> 00:15:12,921
That's all right, there's always time.

146
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:14,232
Yeah.

147
00:15:16,238 --> 00:15:19,794
Is that why you left New York?
Because that bartender did you wrong.

148
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,995
Something like that...

149
00:15:24,067 --> 00:15:27,642
8:00 tomorrow, okay?  If you want to get
to Pittsburgh by twelve.

150
00:15:31,827 --> 00:15:33,386
Goodnight.  Thanks for the movie.

151
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:04,747
Well, I looked around, got into real estate.
That's where the performing really paid off.

152
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:10,559
Sizing up situations, handling people, getting what you want
from them without them really knowing, you know.

153
00:16:12,607 --> 00:16:13,425
Control.

154
00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:14,737
Don't worry, you don't have to come in.

155
00:16:16,483 --> 00:16:17,687
Oh, I hate this belt.

156
00:16:17,953 --> 00:16:19,335
It's for your own protection...

157
00:16:19,201 --> 00:16:20,216
I know.

158
00:16:20,644 --> 00:16:22,159
I' ll wait here.

159
00:16:42,575 --> 00:16:44,675
Hey Holly!  Hey Holly!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!

160
00:16:42,952 --> 00:16:45,130
Hey.

161
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,580
Jane! Hi.

162
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,315
Hi!

163
00:16:51,082 --> 00:16:52,627
You look good.

164
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,082
Thanks!  Thanks.  You, too.

165
00:16:58,021 --> 00:16:59,828
What's the matter?

166
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,686
Holly!

167
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:05,174
Look, something's come up, Nick's in a mood.
Could we do this another time?

168
00:17:07,242 --> 00:17:11,633
Hey, we're on the road here!  Look, I'll handle it.
I'll fix it.  Let me talk to him!

169
00:17:17,976 --> 00:17:19,016
Jesus Christ!

170
00:17:24,323 --> 00:17:25,664
He thinks he's lost something.

171
00:17:26,042 --> 00:17:27,058
I thought you said he was clean.

172
00:17:27,361 --> 00:17:30,433
Well, he is.  I mean, he has nine months
in NA.  He's just dealing.

173
00:17:32,122 --> 00:17:35,794
And, you know, he has a drink and he gets confused.

174
00:17:38,235 --> 00:17:42,071
Holly!  If you cleaned this fuckin' place up
maybe I'd be able to find my shit!

175
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:46,169
What the fuck are doing here?!

176
00:17:46,205 --> 00:17:49,482
Hello Nick.  I'm just passin' through.
We'll catch you later.  C'mon.

177
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,368
You think you're going somewhere?!

178
00:17:54,348 --> 00:17:56,056
Nick!  Nick!  Nick!  Nick!  Don't...be a prick.

179
00:17:57,311 --> 00:18:00,377
Stick to what you know, Jane.  That's something
about you girls I could never figure out.

180
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:02,982
What's sex like without a dick?

181
00:18:03,904 --> 00:18:05,257
I don't know, man.  You tell me.

182
00:18:05,647 --> 00:18:07,058
Fuck you!

183
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,689
You wish...
Come on.

184
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,105
You ain't goin' nowhere!

185
00:18:12,074 --> 00:18:13,081
Hey man!

186
00:18:13,786 --> 00:18:14,891
Dyke!

187
00:18:28,614 --> 00:18:29,319
Bullshit!

188
00:18:30,972 --> 00:18:32,385
All you all right?

189
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,675
Uh huh.

190
00:18:34,292 --> 00:18:35,504
Who the fuck are you?!

191
00:18:36,195 --> 00:18:38,912
Hi, how are you?
Are we going?

192
00:18:39,913 --> 00:18:41,358
Yes.

193
00:18:41,841 --> 00:18:43,841
Nobody's going anywhere until I get my coke!

194
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:50,150
This bitch!  She stole it!  She ain't
seein' daylight until she gives it up.

195
00:18:50,468 --> 00:18:54,468
You don't remember shit when you're
drinking, you asshole!  You sold it Tuesday night.

196
00:18:55,171 --> 00:18:59,668
You remember the last time I called you a liar?
Is that the way you want me to play this?!

197
00:18:59,864 --> 00:19:06,061
Guys!  Guys!  Guys!  My hunch is, our two
positions might be a lot closer than we think.

198
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,317
Who do you believe he sold it to?

199
00:19:10,792 --> 00:19:12,692
Frank.  This guy uptown.  A friend.

200
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:14,991
Hey, Nick!

201
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,836
Jane.  Let me close this.
Where's his number?

202
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:21,042
It's on the wall.

203
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:25,309
I'm Robin, by the way.
You must be Holly.

204
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:27,242
Hi!  It's really nice to meet you.

205
00:19:27,387 --> 00:19:28,465
Me, too.

206
00:19:31,277 --> 00:19:32,977
I really like your hair.

207
00:19:32,824 --> 00:19:37,398
Oh, thanks.  The beauty parlor really messed with it.
You know how they never understand.

208
00:19:39,001 --> 00:19:41,075
Is Frank there?  Yeah.

209
00:19:46,139 --> 00:19:50,133
Frank.  You score any coke off me Tuesday night?  Yeah.

210
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:57,351
How much?  Mm hm.  That's what I thought!  Holly's saying
you didn't!  All right, later.

211
00:20:03,261 --> 00:20:05,055
So I sold it to him.

212
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:07,402
Okay, fine.  Let's go.

213
00:20:07,265 --> 00:20:08,515
Where's the fucking money?!

214
00:20:08,601 --> 00:20:09,317
Oh man!

215
00:20:09,705 --> 00:20:11,221
Give us a fuckin' break.

216
00:20:10,936 --> 00:20:11,826
Where's the money?

217
00:20:12,224 --> 00:20:16,257
He hides it.  He always does.  The same
three or four places and I'm not telling.

218
00:20:17,096 --> 00:20:18,081
Tell me where.

219
00:20:19,356 --> 00:20:21,256
I tell you to write it down but you never do, so forget it.

220
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:23,573
You stole it.

221
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:31,116
Jane, you know her.  She's a liar and a thief.
It's not her fault.  It's her fucking nature!

222
00:20:32,052 --> 00:20:33,597
Get the fuck away from me.

223
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:40,264
Fuck you, too, man!  No fucking trust here!
Get the fuck up!  That's what fucking hurts!

224
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:44,693
Ahh, Jesus fuck...Ahh.

225
00:20:47,368 --> 00:20:49,316
What the fuck is wrong with you?  Are you crazy?!

226
00:20:49,726 --> 00:20:50,793
Did I hurt him?

227
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:54,861
"What do you mean ""Did I hurt him?""  You hit
him with a bat!  I'm gonna call the cops, okay?"

228
00:20:55,395 --> 00:20:56,474
Oh fuck...

229
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:01,023
He's alive.

230
00:21:02,768 --> 00:21:04,665
Give me the bat!  Give it to me right now!

231
00:21:08,175 --> 00:21:11,259
I'm gonna kill you, Holly.  I'm gonna fuckin' kill you...

232
00:21:11,518 --> 00:21:12,018
No!

233
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,840
Time out!
Nobody move.

234
00:21:18,389 --> 00:21:23,389
Jane, give me the bat, please.
Holly, don't tease him.

235
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:31,479
And Nick, you have some real like
ability issues.  Now who has tape?

236
00:21:37,281 --> 00:21:38,555
I do not feel good about this.

237
00:21:39,057 --> 00:21:43,057
Oh, what would you like to do?  Call the police?
They'll arrest them both.  There's drugs everywhere.

238
00:21:42,623 --> 00:21:45,076
What are you doing?

239
00:21:44,438 --> 00:21:45,738
Oh, nothing.

240
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,131
Just the cash.  I'm clean.

241
00:21:52,554 --> 00:21:54,997
No.  We're not taking drug money on the road.
Put it back.

242
00:21:56,554 --> 00:21:58,513
Well, it's not like you can tell by looking at it.

243
00:21:59,664 --> 00:22:01,880
Okay, you have a point.
We'll just take half.  All right?

244
00:22:02,664 --> 00:22:06,380
And, we are not taking drugs with us on the
road with us either, so give them here.  Thank you.

245
00:22:08,117 --> 00:22:09,060
You're welcome.

246
00:22:13,274 --> 00:22:16,312
We'll take the gag off when we leave
and there will be four hours of loud music,

247
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:19,121
after which point you'll will scream for help.
Meanwhile, work on the tape.  Okay?

248
00:22:20,192 --> 00:22:21,730
Phone's in the kitchen.
Water.

249
00:22:23,256 --> 00:22:24,459
Thanks, hon.  Right here.

250
00:22:25,641 --> 00:22:28,044
Everyone go potty,
we don't want to have to stop!

251
00:22:28,171 --> 00:22:29,316
I went.

252
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:33,295
Look what she's doing!

253
00:22:34,096 --> 00:22:36,796
Don't tease the animal!
Come on.  Go!  Go!  Go!

254
00:22:45,641 --> 00:22:47,651
I'm gonna kill you Holly!
I'm gonna kill you!  Holly!

255
00:22:49,825 --> 00:22:52,607
Let's go!  Don't worry.
I feel really firmly about it.

256
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:00,561
Would you close the door!

257
00:23:24,746 --> 00:23:27,784
I am not going over a cliff
for you two, so just forget it.

258
00:23:44,659 --> 00:23:47,812
I've got some friends in St. Louis.
You remember Linda.  I can stay with her.

259
00:23:49,481 --> 00:23:51,234
So, where are you guys going?

260
00:23:51,193 --> 00:23:52,952
Los Angeles, then San Diego.

261
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:54,883
Yeah, and you're not coming.

262
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:56,247
Bummer.

263
00:23:57,422 --> 00:24:00,222
Listen.  Why did you stay with this guy so long?

264
00:24:01,499 --> 00:24:04,535
A lot of that back there was drugs.
You know, they really fuck him up.

265
00:24:05,747 --> 00:24:07,456
But he's a really nice guy underneath?

266
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:09,772
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

267
00:24:10,455 --> 00:24:13,829
It's the sex.  Come on, let's be frank, okay.
He was great in bed.  Am I right?

268
00:24:14,326 --> 00:24:18,826
Sometimes.  I don't know, I mean,
I think that there's something beyond sex.

269
00:24:20,003 --> 00:24:21,080
Yeah, me.

270
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:27,620
Well, I don't know, but I certainly didn't like his attitude
and I'm going to think long and hard before I take him back.

271
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:29,577
You go, girl.

272
00:24:37,037 --> 00:24:41,112
Hi, you've reached Nick and Holly.
Leave a message after the beep and we'll get back to you.

273
00:24:42,682 --> 00:24:44,423
Oh, my fuckin' head!

274
00:24:59,385 --> 00:25:02,885
Thank you, really?  Oh my God, are you kidding?
That "Dance Fever" was my favorite.

275
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:07,268
I thought Danny Tarragon was
the coolest guy I ever heard...

276
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:11,214
Would you look at her!
It's pathological, man.

277
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:14,456
She's young.

278
00:25:14,595 --> 00:25:15,765
I guess.

279
00:25:17,024 --> 00:25:18,194
How you doing?

280
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,098
I'm fine.  A little tired.

281
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:25,222
You were great back there.
You must have sold a ton of condos.

282
00:25:25,885 --> 00:25:27,392
It was kind of fun.
Adrenaline.

283
00:25:29,271 --> 00:25:32,315
You were very frightening.
I was very proud of you.

284
00:25:34,637 --> 00:25:36,207
Um, it was very nice meeting you.

285
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:51,762
Yes!

286
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,022
Is Robin asleep already?

287
00:25:55,184 --> 00:25:56,941
Yeah, you know, she gets tired real easy.

288
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:01,045
You know, she doesn't look so good.

289
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:03,704
She has all those allergies, man.
You know, they come and go.

290
00:26:04,724 --> 00:26:06,302
Did you call Linda yet?

291
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,732
Yeah, I was just thinking.
You guys can just go ahead and leave tomorrow

292
00:26:09,525 --> 00:26:11,225
and I'll just grab a bus.

293
00:26:12,161 --> 00:26:15,561
Well why?  We're going right through St. Louis.
I mean, it's no big deal

294
00:26:17,687 --> 00:26:20,487
Oh, you're going back, aren't you?

295
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:23,164
Might as well.

296
00:26:23,932 --> 00:26:26,944
What do you mean, "Might as well"?
This is a guy who kicks your ass all the time.

297
00:26:27,033 --> 00:26:28,245
This is not love, Honey.

298
00:26:28,748 --> 00:26:30,301
Yeah, maybe you're right.

299
00:26:30,107 --> 00:26:32,507
Look.  The man is going to kill you.

300
00:26:33,025 --> 00:26:35,525
We humiliated him.  We tied him up.
Come on!

301
00:26:39,093 --> 00:26:42,365
I mean, I can't always do what you think
I should do.  Like, we've been there, Jane.

302
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:47,318
Fine.  I just don't understand why you keep
setting yourself up to get hurt.  That's all.

303
00:26:49,372 --> 00:26:50,454
You should talk.

304
00:26:51,507 --> 00:26:52,753
What does that mean?

305
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,379
Look, you've guys have been really great
and I really like Robin,

306
00:26:57,053 --> 00:26:59,753
and I just hope you know that she's not gay.

307
00:26:59,604 --> 00:27:00,448
So what?

308
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:04,607
So, that's what I meant by saying,
"You should talk."

309
00:27:21,233 --> 00:27:23,515
Hey Nick.  Nick?

310
00:27:27,254 --> 00:27:28,736
Oh shit!

311
00:27:51,313 --> 00:27:53,831
Here we are.  Okay.
Take care of yourself.

312
00:27:53,434 --> 00:27:55,938
You, too.
Get some sunshine, okay?

313
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:56,642
Okay.

314
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:58,076
Promise?

315
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:59,946
Okay.
Take care of yourself.

316
00:28:01,935 --> 00:28:03,080
Bye, Jane.

317
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:09,650
She'll get over it.
See ya.

318
00:28:12,082 --> 00:28:12,889
Thank you.

319
00:28:13,011 --> 00:28:13,711
It's her life.

320
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:19,522
Yeah, but she gives us all a bad name
with that "I'm addicted to a bad guy" stuff.

321
00:28:20,852 --> 00:28:22,887
Thank you.  I hope that
everything was satisfactory.

322
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:28,902
Um, actually, the green on
number eight is a little rough.

323
00:28:29,392 --> 00:28:33,392
Oh really?  Well, we'll check it out
as soon as we can.  Is there anything else?

324
00:28:39,222 --> 00:28:41,867
What?  What?  Why are you
screaming like that?  What?

325
00:28:47,511 --> 00:28:49,356
Oh shit.

326
00:28:57,484 --> 00:28:59,912
Move closer!  Just a little bit closer.  Okay.

327
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,270
There she is.

328
00:29:21,075 --> 00:29:23,151
Nick...dead!  No...Nick...dead!

329
00:29:32,015 --> 00:29:34,091
Sounds like "head!"

330
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:38,450
Oh, wait a minute.  I have an idea.

331
00:29:41,618 --> 00:29:42,671
What are you writing?

332
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,089
Morre.

333
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:48,048
It's French for "dead!"
I can't write dead...!

334
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:50,529
Who's Morty?

335
00:29:54,027 --> 00:29:55,231
Dead!

336
00:30:04,206 --> 00:30:05,410
Get off the bus!

337
00:30:08,804 --> 00:30:13,359
Oh, I can't believe this.  I mean, he was alive when we left!
I have a photo.  Do you think it would help?

338
00:30:19,994 --> 00:30:21,949
He was such a nice guy, once in a while.

339
00:30:22,442 --> 00:30:26,373
Stop with the "nice guy' stuff.
They have to believe this was self-defense.

340
00:30:26,548 --> 00:30:27,748
Who's "they"?

341
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:30,007
What do you mean, "Who's they?"
The cops in Pittsburgh.

342
00:30:29,986 --> 00:30:31,189
Oh!  You want me to go back there?

343
00:30:31,294 --> 00:30:32,009
Yeah!

344
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:32,749
Now?

345
00:30:32,586 --> 00:30:33,337
Yes!

346
00:30:33,272 --> 00:30:34,007
I couldn't.

347
00:30:34,055 --> 00:30:34,759
Why not?

348
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:36,470
Memories.

349
00:30:36,895 --> 00:30:38,477
What fuckin' memories?

350
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:41,315
Why does she have to go back?
Why don't we just pretend we never saw it?

351
00:30:42,101 --> 00:30:43,698
Please tell me you're kidding.

352
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:46,844
No.  When we left, he was alive.
How do we know that what she did killed him?

353
00:30:47,699 --> 00:30:51,468
Exactly!  I mean, he could have tripped
and hit his head on the bat.  It could happen.

354
00:30:51,521 --> 00:30:53,523
No!  You're going back.
This is not a game.

355
00:30:54,647 --> 00:30:56,810
I can't go to jail.
Not with the baby.

356
00:30:59,054 --> 00:31:00,569
What baby, Honey?

357
00:31:03,266 --> 00:31:04,766
I'm eight weeks pregnant.

358
00:31:04,587 --> 00:31:07,096
What?  You were going to
bring a baby into that house?

359
00:31:07,505 --> 00:31:09,238
Oh, like what were my options?

360
00:31:09,073 --> 00:31:10,662
How about abortion?

361
00:31:10,352 --> 00:31:12,634
I couldn't do that.
I'd feel like a murderer.

362
00:31:12,648 --> 00:31:14,024
Honey, you are a murderer!

363
00:31:17,002 --> 00:31:19,455
Oh God.  To think it's possible
that I killed my baby's daddy.

364
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:25,494
To think it's possible?  You hit him in
the head with a baseball bat--he's dead!

365
00:31:26,461 --> 00:31:29,042
No!  To think it's possible
that Nick is the daddy?

366
00:31:35,654 --> 00:31:39,226
We never saw the newspaper.  She hit him in self-defense.
She split.  She's never gonna see him again.

367
00:31:40,328 --> 00:31:42,400
I'll call my lawyer in New York.
He'll tell us what to do.

368
00:31:43,016 --> 00:31:44,988
If we have to go back, we'll say
we came as soon as we found out.

369
00:31:46,719 --> 00:31:50,078
That's fine with me.  I suggest we
keep driving.  We sleep in shifts.

370
00:31:50,903 --> 00:31:54,262
The farther away from that body
I get, the happier I'll be.

371
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,667
She wrote, "The Ballad of the Lonely Masturbater," here,
try this it's really good... "The Celebration of my Uterus," and...

372
00:32:38,746 --> 00:32:40,890
Oh, no no, Holly.
Stop the car!  Stop it!

373
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:45,533
Oh fine!  I'll go get it.
All right!

374
00:33:32,788 --> 00:33:34,824
But then Nick pissed some people off
and we had to move to Pittsburgh...

375
00:33:36,274 --> 00:33:37,110
Can I have a bite of that?

376
00:33:39,474 --> 00:33:41,010
Yeah, well...it's been a long couple of days.

377
00:33:42,364 --> 00:33:43,888
Yeah... Tell me about it.

378
00:33:47,896 --> 00:33:50,828
Jane's been so great to me.  I mean, at first
she just liked me because of the whole "gay thing."

379
00:33:52,216 --> 00:33:53,716
Jane is gay?

380
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,075
Like, hello!  You didn't know?

381
00:33:57,694 --> 00:33:59,440
I don't know, I just...Don't look!
It's okay.  It's okay.

382
00:34:11,311 --> 00:34:12,957
Anyway, she just got dumped
so you know, rebound time.

383
00:34:17,132 --> 00:34:20,090
I know, eew gross.  But don't worry.
She won't try anything, especially not after me.

384
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:25,387
I told her that is was a real self-hating
thing to get crushes on straight girls.

385
00:34:27,457 --> 00:34:30,885
But this person that dumped her,
she was gay, right?

386
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:33,524
Yeah, but I mean even with gay girls,
there are no guarantees.

387
00:34:34,854 --> 00:34:37,434
They're very emotional.
That's about all I know.

388
00:34:38,899 --> 00:34:41,479
They love uniforms,
and don't break their hearts.

389
00:34:42,085 --> 00:34:43,134
Uniforms?

390
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:45,033
Oh yeah, all kinds.
Especially U.P.S.

391
00:34:46,775 --> 00:34:47,818
Will that be all?

392
00:34:52,566 --> 00:34:53,508
I'll get the check.

393
00:34:53,414 --> 00:34:54,240
Thanks.

394
00:34:57,612 --> 00:35:00,684
Not that I'm an expert.  I mean,
she's the only one I've seen,

395
00:35:00,883 --> 00:35:03,955
except for the ones in the porno tapes
Nick used to rent...

396
00:35:19,104 --> 00:35:20,876
I'm sorry.  It's just every time
I think of his little ways...

397
00:36:07,308 --> 00:36:08,587
Try to look a little more western.
That's good.

398
00:36:09,659 --> 00:36:10,659
Take the picture!

399
00:36:11,241 --> 00:36:12,651
You sort of need to something.

400
00:36:14,904 --> 00:36:15,900
Here.

401
00:36:16,658 --> 00:36:17,367
That's cute.

402
00:36:41,709 --> 00:36:43,709
Hey!  Hey!  Hey! Hey!  Hey!
Who you calling?  Who you calling?

403
00:36:46,587 --> 00:36:48,450
I was calling a friend.

404
00:36:48,937 --> 00:36:51,977
Uh uh, no, you can't call that friend, he's dead.
And you're not supposed to know he's dead.

405
00:36:55,483 --> 00:36:57,490
But...I want my friend.
I want Nick!

406
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:07,713
Hey, will you come talk to Holly, please.

407
00:37:07,402 --> 00:37:08,652
Don't come in!

408
00:37:09,217 --> 00:37:10,261
What's the matter?

409
00:37:52,781 --> 00:37:53,856
Ms. DeLuca?

410
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,268
Susan Newbauer.
She asked me to talk to you.

411
00:37:57,253 --> 00:37:59,824
It's pneumonia.  We'll have to keep
her here for a couple of days.

412
00:38:00,386 --> 00:38:01,969
Can we see her?

413
00:38:01,401 --> 00:38:04,401
Tomorrow, after eleven.
Just go on up to the eighth floor.

414
00:38:05,395 --> 00:38:07,895
It's typical in this kind of AIDS-related pneumonia.

415
00:38:08,909 --> 00:38:10,388
AIDS?

416
00:38:11,476 --> 00:38:12,955
You tellin' me she's got AIDS?

417
00:38:19,784 --> 00:38:21,492
I'm sorry, I thought you knew.

418
00:38:22,696 --> 00:38:23,773
No, I didn't.

419
00:38:24,096 --> 00:38:26,146
She's okay.
She'll be out in less than a week.

420
00:38:56,552 --> 00:38:57,996
How ya doin'?

421
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,960
I'm sorry.

422
00:39:08,082 --> 00:39:10,704
For what?  It's not like you knew
this was going to happen.

423
00:39:15,347 --> 00:39:20,156
I thought...if I could just go somewhere else...

424
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,488
I could make it...not happen.

425
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,009
I shouldn't have lied to you.

426
00:39:34,031 --> 00:39:37,063
It wasn't a lie, exactly.  It was more like
a sinful omission.  Can I sit down?

427
00:39:47,058 --> 00:39:48,758
So I guess now we're even.

428
00:39:51,416 --> 00:39:52,317
How so?

429
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:55,462
Well, Holly told me that
you didn't know I was gay.

430
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:58,833
I don't want you to worry because...
You know, I'm not after you.

431
00:40:02,194 --> 00:40:03,704
I'm not worried...

432
00:40:07,742 --> 00:40:08,952
Why?

433
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,237
Luck of the draw, I guess.

434
00:40:12,078 --> 00:40:14,144
No, I mean, why aren't you after me?

435
00:40:15,884 --> 00:40:18,200
'Cause you're not my type.

436
00:40:26,417 --> 00:40:28,595
Is this a black-white thing?

437
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:35,255
It's more like, uh, blondes-Carpenter thing....

438
00:40:42,035 --> 00:40:44,100
You're safe with me.

439
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:54,740
Is there somebody I should call
or something, like family?

440
00:41:01,977 --> 00:41:06,280
Oh...my mother?  We don't communicate much.
Not anymore...

441
00:41:09,162 --> 00:41:11,365
What about you?
You've got to get to L.A.

442
00:41:20,406 --> 00:41:21,609
Would you get me some more ice?

443
00:41:39,353 --> 00:41:43,353
What is it?  Wait!  Wait!  Wait!

444
00:41:49,076 --> 00:41:52,076
What is it?
Are you in pain?

445
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:52,255
No.

446
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,464
What is it?

447
00:41:55,607 --> 00:42:03,954
I don't know where to go.  I don't have
any place to go...I don't know...anyplace...

448
00:42:09,705 --> 00:42:11,014
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.

449
00:42:20,179 --> 00:42:24,940
Sometimes, if you don't have any place to go,
it's probably a good idea to stay where you are.

450
00:42:37,441 --> 00:42:40,850
Okay?  All right, here, hum...
put your arm around me...

451
00:42:46,007 --> 00:42:47,216
Jesus, your weight....

452
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:01,911
This might be the wrong time
to bring this up, but...

453
00:43:03,246 --> 00:43:06,455
where the fuck are we?
I mean, really.  Where are we?

454
00:43:08,071 --> 00:43:09,224
Tucson.

455
00:43:09,455 --> 00:43:11,056
As in Arizona?
Are you serious?

456
00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:15,056
Hey, you know what this means?
I'm gonna have to go out

457
00:43:15,257 --> 00:43:18,341
and get some cowboy boots....
What about a horse?

458
00:43:30,224 --> 00:43:33,882
Okay, good.  No, I'm just gonna
go straight from work.  Yeah.

459
00:43:42,881 --> 00:43:45,881
I'm leaving now, Holly.  So if
you're coming, get off the phone.

460
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:49,160
I'm coming.
Okay, I've got to go.  Yeah, bye.

461
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:53,392
Will still have to pick up the cake.

462
00:43:53,444 --> 00:43:55,086
Do you think she's gonna be surprised?

463
00:43:54,827 --> 00:43:56,323
That's the idea.  Hurry up!

464
00:43:57,627 --> 00:43:58,570
Okay!

465
00:43:59,049 --> 00:44:02,082
So I'll pick up the cake myself 'cause I have
to drop by the hospital for a blood test.

466
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:05,231
Okay, but I told Abe to meet us there around ten...

467
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:07,690
What?  Are you okay?

468
00:44:07,774 --> 00:44:09,281
Kicking all morning long!

469
00:44:10,218 --> 00:44:14,125
Anyway, I told him to meet us there at ten.
I really think that you're gonna like him.

470
00:44:14,227 --> 00:44:17,701
I like any man that dates a pregnant woman.
I wonder about him, but I like him.

471
00:44:42,255 --> 00:44:47,086
Two hands.  In this bar we wash the glasses with two hands.
That's the difference between clean an absolutely fucking disgusting.

472
00:44:48,387 --> 00:44:51,483
Watch your language, your bambinos are coming.

473
00:44:50,435 --> 00:44:52,350
Mom!  Hi Mom!

474
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:56,624
Get in the kitchen and stay there.
She sees you two and the cat is out of the bag.

475
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:05,904
Oh God.  Is there no mercy?  I can't believe it.
A body like that on a 12-year old.

476
00:45:20,005 --> 00:45:21,793
That's enough candles.

477
00:45:24,087 --> 00:45:25,197
Oh come on.
We all know she's not twelve.

478
00:45:26,466 --> 00:45:27,969
It's not polite.

479
00:45:29,912 --> 00:45:31,689
Oh sorry, am I late?
Great.

480
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,960
Hey, ready?

481
00:46:28,871 --> 00:46:30,453
Can I have a light?

482
00:46:36,011 --> 00:46:37,755
Give me that thing!

483
00:46:43,545 --> 00:46:45,289
You're such a slut.

484
00:47:16,105 --> 00:47:19,137
I don't know.  It's like gay people are
the only people getting laid anymore.

485
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:20,458
Maybe you oughtta try it.

486
00:47:21,016 --> 00:47:24,546
I like being straight.  And I think
heterosexuality is making a comeback.

487
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:27,910
Not if you have anything to do with it.
Go dance.

488
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:29,687
Excuse me.

489
00:47:33,357 --> 00:47:34,554
Say, Robin?

490
00:47:35,298 --> 00:47:37,041
Would you like to dance?

491
00:47:37,686 --> 00:47:38,793
Yeah

492
00:48:00,541 --> 00:48:01,548
Oh, Jesus.

493
00:48:06,184 --> 00:48:09,189
My dream evening...  Lesbians and cops.
What's next, Republicans?

494
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:11,755
Cop.  Cop.  Cop.

495
00:48:16,908 --> 00:48:18,705
Evening, ladies.  Sir.

496
00:48:21,303 --> 00:48:22,900
I'm looking for a Holly Pulchik.

497
00:48:24,809 --> 00:48:25,806
Uh...

498
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,112
Who?

499
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:31,359
Holly Pulchik.  Blonde hair,
green eyes, about five-four.

500
00:48:32,749 --> 00:48:33,746
She's...

501
00:48:34,059 --> 00:48:35,459
Hey!  You made it!

502
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:37,060
There she is.

503
00:48:37,419 --> 00:48:40,424
I was afraid some crime
would keep you away.

504
00:48:40,546 --> 00:48:43,646
No, it couldn't.  It happens to be a slow night.

505
00:48:45,211 --> 00:48:49,911
Fridays...and when Friday's the first and when
they get their checks, we have to be ready...

506
00:48:50,037 --> 00:48:52,603
It's time to go.  Good night everyone,
we're going to clean up.

507
00:48:53,316 --> 00:48:55,282
Excuse me, nice to meet you officer.

508
00:48:55,491 --> 00:48:57,773
No, please.  Call me Abe.

509
00:49:02,216 --> 00:49:05,325
Abe?  As in Abe Lincoln?
What is this, some kind of joke?

510
00:49:05,335 --> 00:49:08,327
No, it's his name.  Isn't that a coincidence?
Just like the president.

511
00:49:09,823 --> 00:49:13,805
I mean, like, I wonder why his parents thought
that Abraham and Lincoln sounded good together.

512
00:49:16,706 --> 00:49:21,147
Now, let me guess.  You must be Robin.
Nice to meet you Robin.

513
00:49:22,453 --> 00:49:23,994
And this is Jane.

514
00:49:25,088 --> 00:49:26,658
Hi, Jane.  Happy birthday.

515
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:29,465
Oh, thank you.  Peppers.

516
00:49:30,779 --> 00:49:32,281
Yes, they're from my garden.

517
00:49:32,676 --> 00:49:33,973
Oh, isn't he sweet?

518
00:49:36,664 --> 00:49:39,679
Now, now, Babe.
Not while I'm still in uniform.

519
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:43,259
Isn't that cute?
He takes it so serious.

520
00:49:46,412 --> 00:49:48,204
Come on, Honey.
Let's go get a drink.

521
00:49:54,921 --> 00:49:58,921
Is it me, or is she workin' her way down some
weird list of guys who call women Babe?

522
00:49:59,975 --> 00:50:01,816
I hope she keeps her mouth shut.

523
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:02,599
Right!

524
00:50:03,765 --> 00:50:04,968
Where are you and Anna going again?

525
00:50:05,363 --> 00:50:06,933
Oh, she's taking me to see some damn psychic.

526
00:50:08,635 --> 00:50:09,915
Here's your ride.

527
00:50:13,089 --> 00:50:14,568
Robin.  Uh, do you need a ride home?

528
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:16,568
Oh, I have a car.

529
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:20,392
Oh no, didn't I tell you?  Holly came up to me
and sighed and said that she needed the car.

530
00:50:21,532 --> 00:50:22,810
It's on my way.

531
00:50:23,515 --> 00:50:25,281
Oh, could you take these for me?
Thanks.

532
00:50:32,327 --> 00:50:36,842
Jane! I don't want to be late for this woman.
She scares the shit out of me.

533
00:50:38,174 --> 00:50:39,618
Okay.  Let's go.

534
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:42,875
She is really good.  You have to prepared
when you get there.

535
00:50:52,958 --> 00:50:57,448
Here we go.  There's a long trip here.
Traveling.

536
00:51:01,496 --> 00:51:05,586
This is nice, you're in love.
This is very nice.

537
00:51:12,422 --> 00:51:13,422
What?

538
00:51:15,117 --> 00:51:17,697
This is a friend.  I feel...

539
00:51:19,188 --> 00:51:23,468
This is not good at all.  There's a sickness here...
There's a curse...

540
00:51:26,353 --> 00:51:29,933
Yes?  Yes.  This is a curse.  I can feel it.

541
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:33,324
Can you do anything to remove the curse?

542
00:51:33,877 --> 00:51:34,577
Anna!

543
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:35,978
No, she can do that!
Last year I...

544
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:38,130
Anna, sit down.

545
00:51:39,105 --> 00:51:40,602
Let me talk to my guides.

546
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:48,657
You're gonna talk to these rocks?  Are you talking to
these rocks and they're gonna say something to you?

547
00:51:49,437 --> 00:51:51,352
I'd cross your legs here.

548
00:51:58,930 --> 00:51:59,926
You want some?

549
00:52:00,721 --> 00:52:02,282
Oh, yeah.  Yeah, thanks.

550
00:52:03,191 --> 00:52:04,718
How was the psychic?

551
00:52:04,751 --> 00:52:06,230
Don't ask.

552
00:52:10,101 --> 00:52:12,580
How was Alex?
Did he leave fingerprints all over you?

553
00:52:15,226 --> 00:52:17,726
What is it with me and bartenders?

554
00:52:18,165 --> 00:52:19,254
I don't know.

555
00:52:19,775 --> 00:52:22,511
He's coming with us Saturday night.
To the street fair.

556
00:52:23,477 --> 00:52:27,062
Well, good.  There's safety in numbers.
Just don't let him get you by yourself.

557
00:52:32,999 --> 00:52:34,784
I cannot believe he's a cop.

558
00:52:35,609 --> 00:52:37,214
He's cute though, huh?

559
00:52:37,303 --> 00:52:38,873
Yeah, for a cop.

560
00:52:39,936 --> 00:52:41,936
He does have a nice heiny.

561
00:52:42,711 --> 00:52:46,307
Heiny?  What is he, two years old?
He has a nice heiny?

562
00:52:48,391 --> 00:52:49,767
Don't laugh!

563
00:52:50,313 --> 00:52:54,814
And don't think that I didn't see you
checkin' out that man's basket.

564
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:55,351
Eew!

565
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:57,213
Eew!  What do you call it?

566
00:52:58,431 --> 00:53:01,976
I don't call it anything.  I just wasn't brought up
to talk about a person's anatomy.

567
00:53:03,012 --> 00:53:05,028
That's probably because you
don't have a word for it.

568
00:53:05,116 --> 00:53:08,317
That's just ridiculous.  I do, too.
It just doesn't often come up.

569
00:53:08,746 --> 00:53:11,934
Okay.  What is this, below the belly button?

570
00:53:13,095 --> 00:53:16,095
"I'm not going to say "..." if that's what
you're after, okay, I hate that."

571
00:53:16,686 --> 00:53:19,910
Okay.  So, what do you call it?

572
00:53:20,562 --> 00:53:21,782
Down there.

573
00:53:21,876 --> 00:53:23,584
Oh, come on!  "Down there!"

574
00:53:23,651 --> 00:53:25,129
Well, "vagina" seems so formal.

575
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:28,028
But you make it sound like a basement!

576
00:53:27,962 --> 00:53:28,994
Okay.  Honestly?

577
00:53:29,248 --> 00:53:31,762
Fine.  "Hoo-hoo" or "cissy."

578
00:53:32,831 --> 00:53:35,600
You're kidding, right?  A "hoo-hoo"
or a "cissy," what is that?

579
00:53:35,976 --> 00:53:40,177
Well that's what my mother called it.  I had a "hoo-hoo"
or a "cissy" and my brother had a "noodle" or a "dingle."

580
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:43,153
And that's what you still call it?

581
00:53:44,226 --> 00:53:49,714
Well, it's better than "pussy."  Or "beaver."
What's that about?  I never got that...

582
00:53:51,307 --> 00:53:52,107
Or worse.

583
00:53:52,624 --> 00:53:55,024
Worse?  Did you say worse?

584
00:53:57,174 --> 00:53:59,674
Now, what could be worse?
I have to hear you say it.

585
00:53:59,954 --> 00:54:01,191
Well, you know.
I'm not going to say it.

586
00:54:01,449 --> 00:54:03,701
Oh, come on!  "C-U-N-T."
Come on, please?

587
00:54:04,385 --> 00:54:05,333
I don't think so.

588
00:54:05,025 --> 00:54:07,189
Please?  It'll free you.  Try it!

589
00:54:07,224 --> 00:54:09,041
There's a policeman within the sound of my voice.

590
00:54:09,405 --> 00:54:10,453
Give him a thrill.

591
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:11,879
I'm gonna wet you.

592
00:54:11,906 --> 00:54:13,213
No!  You're such a baby!

593
00:54:13,569 --> 00:54:14,549
Okay.  Come on.

594
00:54:14,354 --> 00:54:16,096
All right.
"Cunt."

595
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,176
What?  What was that?

596
00:54:19,663 --> 00:54:20,482
I said it!

597
00:54:20,311 --> 00:54:22,622
No, you breathed it!
I want to hear you say it.

598
00:54:22,294 --> 00:54:24,679
All right.  "C-U-N-T, cunt."

599
00:54:25,706 --> 00:54:27,243
Cunt.  Cunt. CUNT!

600
00:54:27,281 --> 00:54:28,818
Free!

601
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:36,834
You've got a dirty mouth.

602
00:54:37,973 --> 00:54:41,052
You were right.  I feel...I don't know, different.

603
00:54:42,507 --> 00:54:47,076
That's because you're free Miss Scarlett!
You're free!  C'mon, let's go get everybody and tell them!

604
00:54:54,461 --> 00:54:55,861
That can't be good for the baby.

605
00:54:56,507 --> 00:55:00,004
Oh, well, you know.  They'll probably
take a break in the delivery room.

606
00:55:04,017 --> 00:55:05,314
Do you miss it?

607
00:55:05,659 --> 00:55:06,956
What?

608
00:55:08,503 --> 00:55:09,756
Sex.

609
00:55:11,545 --> 00:55:13,304
Yeah, I do....

610
00:55:17,383 --> 00:55:19,642
You know what's weird?

611
00:55:20,965 --> 00:55:24,024
You never know the last time you sleep
with somebody it's the last time.

612
00:55:26,299 --> 00:55:30,058
You're thinking:  "Oh, we got problems,
we got work to do," you know,

613
00:55:31,896 --> 00:55:33,855
but you never think...

614
00:55:36,755 --> 00:55:40,114
and then you break up
and a month later you look back

615
00:55:40,975 --> 00:55:43,734
and you go:  "Oh, that was it."

616
00:55:44,024 --> 00:55:46,583
That Tuesday or Friday or whenever,

617
00:55:49,134 --> 00:55:52,993
you wished you paid attention
because it was the last time.

618
00:56:05,789 --> 00:56:09,333
Listen, thanks for my birthday present.
Because a girl can never have too many.

619
00:56:11,499 --> 00:56:12,577
I know.  I'm sorry.

620
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:14,031
No. No.  I love it.

621
00:56:16,801 --> 00:56:18,067
Well, happy birthday.

622
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:22,256
You're mail is in the living room.

623
00:56:22,697 --> 00:56:24,577
Good night, I drank too much.

624
00:56:24,364 --> 00:56:25,360
Good night.

625
00:58:34,475 --> 00:58:35,679
So what's the deal?
Do you like her or what?

626
00:58:36,657 --> 00:58:39,374
"Yeah, I do.  I've been trying.  But you know...

627
00:58:39,899 --> 00:58:43,916
she's got that "back off" thing goin' on
so I just assumed that she was one of the girls.

628
00:58:46,527 --> 00:58:50,124
No.  She's not that.  She's definitely
not one of the girls.

629
00:58:50,613 --> 00:58:51,548
No kidding?

630
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:53,979
No kidding.
Just shy, you know.

631
00:58:55,794 --> 00:58:58,616
So, I hear you're goin' with us on Saturday?

632
00:58:58,105 --> 00:58:59,274
I am now.

633
00:59:01,534 --> 00:59:04,132
We should have a little talk.

634
00:59:03,446 --> 00:59:06,803
Come on, I'll give you a beer.
Come on.

635
00:59:23,573 --> 00:59:24,782
Ready?

636
00:59:27,639 --> 00:59:30,792
All right.  One...two...three...There you go.

637
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:38,349
Higher!  Higher!

638
01:00:45,641 --> 01:00:46,913
You want a drink?

639
01:01:09,222 --> 01:01:10,219
You okay?

640
01:01:10,551 --> 01:01:12,328
Mm hm.  Just tired.

641
01:01:14,165 --> 01:01:15,962
She's having a good time.

642
01:01:20,672 --> 01:01:23,523
That's good, no?  That's what you wanted.

643
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:39,380
Holly?  Hey Babe.  Is something the matter?

644
01:01:44,406 --> 01:01:47,116
It smells like marijuana out here.

645
01:01:48,444 --> 01:01:49,741
Clove cigarettes.

646
01:01:51,308 --> 01:01:53,513
Now you know that's not good for the baby.

647
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:59,266
Yeah, well, having him come out of that tiny hole
is not good for me, either, so  we're even.

648
01:02:00,567 --> 01:02:02,109
What is wrong?

649
01:02:03,031 --> 01:02:05,102
I've got things on my mind.

650
01:02:08,765 --> 01:02:11,048
It's that guy, right?  Nick?

651
01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:15,387
Who told you about him?

652
01:02:17,319 --> 01:02:21,419
Well, it had to be someone.  And besides,
you keep calling out "Nick" in bed

653
01:02:25,404 --> 01:02:26,746
I do?

654
01:02:28,067 --> 01:02:31,172
Well, maybe it's something that sounds like Nick.

655
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:34,000
Does he know about the baby?

656
01:02:36,104 --> 01:02:40,176
I'm only here temporarily.
I might go back.

657
01:02:41,277 --> 01:02:51,080
I know that.  And I will not stand in your way.
But if he loves you so much, why doesn't he call?

658
01:02:53,081 --> 01:02:55,535
Maybe he can't get to a phone.

659
01:02:58,782 --> 01:03:02,559
Come on back to the party.
I want to get one dance before we go.

660
01:03:04,875 --> 01:03:05,872
All right.

661
01:03:56,819 --> 01:03:58,335
No, stop.

662
01:04:00,508 --> 01:04:01,883
You don't like it?

663
01:04:01,745 --> 01:04:02,914
No, I do.  I do like it.

664
01:04:04,136 --> 01:04:05,270
Yes, so do I....

665
01:04:11,999 --> 01:04:14,333
Feel me girl.  Come on, put your hands on me.

666
01:04:21,313 --> 01:04:22,780
Slow, slow, slow.

667
01:04:23,407 --> 01:04:24,615
Okay, real slow.

668
01:04:34,183 --> 01:04:36,090
I'm a little drunk.  Oh gosh.

669
01:04:50,939 --> 01:04:52,639
You are so beautiful.

670
01:04:53,755 --> 01:04:54,955
No I'm not.

671
01:04:56,690 --> 01:05:00,091
Oh, yes you are.
You're so fucking beautiful.

672
01:05:03,136 --> 01:05:05,137
And you taste so good.

673
01:05:39,813 --> 01:05:40,592
Alex.

674
01:05:40,573 --> 01:05:42,580
Talk to me.
Tell me what you like.

675
01:05:42,669 --> 01:05:43,669
Listen.

676
01:05:43,779 --> 01:05:45,775
I want to make you cum so hard.

677
01:05:45,428 --> 01:05:47,635
I gotta...I have to tell you something.

678
01:05:47,370 --> 01:05:48,815
Honey, I know.

679
01:05:49,745 --> 01:05:50,945
You need to know something.

680
01:05:51,527 --> 01:05:53,527
It's okay, I know.
I'm going to use something.

681
01:05:55,047 --> 01:05:58,644
I'm going to use something.  It's okay.
We'll be safe.  Don't worry about it.

682
01:05:59,109 --> 01:06:00,719
About what?

683
01:06:02,188 --> 01:06:03,888
Come on, shh, it's okay.

684
01:06:04,227 --> 01:06:06,096
No.  No.  You don't understand.

685
01:06:10,422 --> 01:06:12,591
I...I'm...positive.  I tested positive.

686
01:06:12,834 --> 01:06:15,985
I know.  I just don't want to talk about it.
Because I already know.

687
01:06:24,565 --> 01:06:26,516
What?  What's the matter?

688
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:30,725
Who told you?

689
01:06:31,111 --> 01:06:32,487
Nobody.  Nobody told me.  Come on...

690
01:06:32,887 --> 01:06:34,671
It was Jane.  She told you.

691
01:06:37,156 --> 01:06:38,795
Yeah, she told me.

692
01:06:39,235 --> 01:06:40,750
Why?

693
01:06:41,857 --> 01:06:47,331
It was no big deal.  She said you were
shy and had...had a bad time with some guy

694
01:06:47,332 --> 01:06:51,289
and I guessed, and she didn't deny it.
It just came up real casually.

695
01:06:51,728 --> 01:06:55,940
It's just part of your history, like hey,
she's on the rebound or something...

696
01:06:55,941 --> 01:06:59,997
so be careful, you know.
It just came out...

697
01:07:01,645 --> 01:07:04,025
What does that make you?  Big hero?

698
01:07:04,785 --> 01:07:10,860
Bringing sex to the unfuckable.
You must feel really good about yourself.

699
01:07:11,161 --> 01:07:11,910
Oh, God.

700
01:07:16,067 --> 01:07:25,782
That's not it.  I just want things the way
they used to be.  You know?

701
01:07:25,783 --> 01:07:32,850
When I meet someone, someone I like, have a good time,
get drunk, and fuck my brains out.

702
01:07:32,851 --> 01:07:35,669
Why can't we do that anymore?

703
01:07:35,670 --> 01:07:39,743
Because you can't.
That's all.  Just can't.

704
01:07:43,844 --> 01:07:45,621
I think you should go home.

705
01:07:48,668 --> 01:07:49,458
Robin.

706
01:07:49,648 --> 01:07:52,648
No, please.  Don't make me beg.  Just go.

707
01:08:22,129 --> 01:08:23,126
Hey, good morning.

708
01:08:26,586 --> 01:08:27,583
How's it going?

709
01:08:29,257 --> 01:08:30,862
How was last night?

710
01:08:31,196 --> 01:08:32,896
Ooh, it was good.

711
01:08:33,324 --> 01:08:35,033
Good.  Is Alex still here?

712
01:08:35,827 --> 01:08:36,828
No, he's gone.

713
01:08:38,187 --> 01:08:40,171
So you had a good time, huh?

714
01:08:40,904 --> 01:08:43,449
Real good time until I found out
you told him I've got HIV.

715
01:08:45,870 --> 01:08:47,670
Well, I didn't exactly tell him, you know.

716
01:08:47,989 --> 01:08:51,609
No, I know.  He guessed.  You know, she
looks like the kind of girl that tested

717
01:08:51,610 --> 01:08:57,173
positive for the AIDS virus.  I
don't know, she's got that kind of glow.

718
01:08:58,074 --> 01:08:59,351
It slipped out.

719
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:01,794
What did you think you were doing,
setting me up like that?

720
01:09:02,183 --> 01:09:05,257
I thought I was doing a good thing.
I mean, I know you like him and he likes you.

721
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:09,410
Yeah, great.  Maybe he'll ask me to go steady.
Maybe he'll take me to the prom.

722
01:09:11,436 --> 01:09:12,371
Come on.

723
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:14,439
What, do you think I'm stupid?

724
01:09:14,944 --> 01:09:16,148
No.  I don't think that at all.

725
01:09:18,048 --> 01:09:19,489
You think that you can just put a man in my bed...

726
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:24,000
and I'll forget?  All it does,
if you want to know, all it does is remind me.

727
01:09:24,001 --> 01:09:28,287
Alex and you and Holly and her baby.
Every living thing I see reminds me.

728
01:09:28,288 --> 01:09:33,672
So what are you going to do?  Are you gonna hide in the house?
Are you going to lock yourself away?  Come on!

729
01:09:33,673 --> 01:09:36,655
You don't know anything about it.
Anyway, it's none of your business.

730
01:09:36,656 --> 01:09:40,162
You're the one that's in love with somebody
that you can never have.

731
01:09:45,636 --> 01:09:49,636
Do me a favor, okay?  I'll stay out of your love life
and you stay out of mine.

732
01:09:49,546 --> 01:09:52,546
Not just my love life.
My life. Stay out of my life!

733
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:53,746
Meaning what?

734
01:09:54,288 --> 01:09:56,031
That means maybe this isn't working.
Maybe you should move.

735
01:10:04,667 --> 01:10:08,931
And take that fucking piano!  If you don't,
I'll leave it out in the rain.  I swear to God I will.

736
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,815
All the way back against the wall.

737
01:10:18,677 --> 01:10:19,181
Hi.

738
01:10:19,572 --> 01:10:21,841
How are you?  Are you going
to teach me to play the piano?

739
01:10:23,043 --> 01:10:23,882
Is this gonna be good?

740
01:10:23,883 --> 01:10:24,625
That's fine.

741
01:10:36,277 --> 01:10:37,309
Hey, Babe?

742
01:10:42,586 --> 01:10:43,986
Marry me.

743
01:10:47,736 --> 01:10:48,975
Get serious!

744
01:10:49,048 --> 01:10:50,390
I am serious.

745
01:10:51,438 --> 01:10:53,581
Get out of town!

746
01:10:59,686 --> 01:11:00,752
Freeze, sucker.

747
01:11:01,059 --> 01:11:02,296
I got you.  I'm gonna get you!

748
01:11:08,119 --> 01:11:10,767
Marry me.  Marry me tomorrow.

749
01:11:13,172 --> 01:11:14,146
I can't marry you, Abe.

750
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:21,051
You're not...you're not over him yet, are you?

751
01:11:23,423 --> 01:11:25,705
Well, we're all over him.

752
01:11:28,016 --> 01:11:30,298
Like, six feet over him.

753
01:11:58,594 --> 01:11:59,935
Mom?

754
01:12:00,632 --> 01:12:03,242
It was an accident, or self-defense.

755
01:12:03,243 --> 01:12:08,258
I mean, I would never kill anybody on purpose or like,
in cold blood.  Hey, did you ever see that movie?

756
01:12:17,496 --> 01:12:19,522
Let's get some rest, okay?

757
01:12:25,309 --> 01:12:29,309
You don't want to marry me now, do you?

758
01:12:30,419 --> 01:12:33,805
We're together now.  We're together.

759
01:12:35,736 --> 01:12:38,522
And that's not changing.

760
01:12:42,729 --> 01:12:44,527
Oh, she looks so thin...

761
01:12:46,813 --> 01:12:48,611
Look at you, Honey.  Oh!
They gave us a terrible map at Hertz.

762
01:12:53,218 --> 01:12:56,867
I have been driving around for
an hour and a half.  Is this your house?

763
01:12:58,241 --> 01:13:01,965
Oh, isn't it quaint.
I need to use the little girl's room, darling.

764
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:04,432
Oh, sure, Mom.

765
01:13:04,762 --> 01:13:08,762
This heat!  The A/C is n.g., right Jer?
You know me.  I like so you need a sweater.

766
01:13:10,457 --> 01:13:12,757
It's two days.  It'll be fine.
I'm Jerry.

767
01:13:13,184 --> 01:13:15,884
Oh, I'm sorry!
Robin, my daughter.  Robin, Jerry.

768
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:19,476
Pleased to meet you....I told her I could have
picked you up.  You didn't need to get a car.

769
01:13:19,934 --> 01:13:25,868
Well, you know me.  I'm so damn independent.
Riding in other people's cars, forget it.

770
01:13:25,869 --> 01:13:33,113
Well, isn't this nice?  Oh, oh look Jer, a cactus flower.
They bloom once every hundred years.

771
01:13:33,114 --> 01:13:35,851
Oh quick, show me the potty, Darling.
I'm about to burst.

772
01:13:38,349 --> 01:13:42,969
Anyway, Jane called me at work.
Wants to know how you are.

773
01:13:42,970 --> 01:13:43,883
I'm fine.

774
01:13:43,834 --> 01:13:44,913
Who's Jane?

775
01:13:44,825 --> 01:13:46,735
Jane used to live here up until a few days ago.

776
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:49,846
Just stay out of this Holly.
It's between me and Jane.

777
01:13:49,847 --> 01:13:53,092
Well, she asked for my advice
so I told her, she's an anti-lesbian.

778
01:13:53,093 --> 01:13:54,537
I am not.

779
01:13:53,781 --> 01:13:55,696
Who's a lesbian?

780
01:13:55,044 --> 01:13:57,257
Jane is.

781
01:13:57,259 --> 01:13:58,762
And she was living here?

782
01:13:58,763 --> 01:14:00,804
Yes, ma'am.

783
01:14:00,777 --> 01:14:02,512
I am not anti-lesbian.

784
01:14:02,513 --> 01:14:04,480
Not you, her.

785
01:14:04,481 --> 01:14:05,574
Jane.

786
01:14:05,575 --> 01:14:10,549
See, this is her old problem.  She creates a situation
where she gets this rejection and everyone else sees it coming.

787
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:12,107
She just wasn't being honest.

788
01:14:12,108 --> 01:14:13,907
Well, I think it's a black thing, too.

789
01:14:13,908 --> 01:14:15,130
Jane is black?

790
01:14:15,131 --> 01:14:16,803
Yes, ma'am.  She sure is.

791
01:14:16,804 --> 01:14:18,938
And you can't live a lie.
You just can't.

792
01:14:18,939 --> 01:14:23,647
Well, there's lying and then
there's just not telling.

793
01:14:23,648 --> 01:14:26,118
She's a black lesbian?

794
01:14:26,119 --> 01:14:28,196
Yes, ma'am.  That's right.

795
01:14:28,197 --> 01:14:31,764
And she was living here, with you?

796
01:14:31,765 --> 01:14:39,624
No, no, no, no.  She was just living here.
They weren't like, fucking or anything...Were you?

797
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:46,575
Were you?

798
01:14:46,576 --> 01:14:47,408
I'll get the coffee.

799
01:14:49,469 --> 01:14:52,011
I have to get going, babe.

800
01:14:52,012 --> 01:14:58,015
Why?  Your shift doesn't start until 10:30.
Don't you wanna go upstairs for a while?

801
01:14:58,016 --> 01:15:01,047
No, not tonight.
It was nice meeting you ma'am.

802
01:15:01,048 --> 01:15:02,278
You're going already?

803
01:15:02,279 --> 01:15:03,438
We have dessert.

804
01:15:03,439 --> 01:15:10,019
Maybe next time, thank you.
Robin, good night.

805
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:12,072
Maybe I'm just too fat now.

806
01:15:12,073 --> 01:15:14,926
Don't worry, Dear.
It's a natural thing.

807
01:15:17,127 --> 01:15:19,110
Will they live here after they get married?

808
01:15:21,842 --> 01:15:25,564
Holly and ...oh, that nice young man.
What is his name?

809
01:15:25,565 --> 01:15:31,488
Oh, Abe...Well, I'm not sure she wants to marry him.

810
01:15:31,489 --> 01:15:36,838
A pregnant girl?  Is she crazy?
She should grab him.

811
01:15:36,839 --> 01:15:41,812
Well, it's not really his baby.

812
01:15:41,813 --> 01:15:48,081
So what?
She still should grab him.

813
01:15:48,082 --> 01:15:51,058
Believe me, I know what she's
going to have to go through.

814
01:15:51,059 --> 01:15:54,084
You know, I'm a feminist, too.

815
01:15:54,085 --> 01:15:59,940
I was a single mother after your father left.
You think that was easy?

816
01:15:59,941 --> 01:16:06,356
I even voted for Carter twice.
But you can't fight nature.

817
01:16:06,357 --> 01:16:11,985
God knows you girls keep trying.
Treating your men like side dishes.

818
01:16:11,986 --> 01:16:15,358
Stick a fork in when needed.
Just like men used to treat us.

819
01:16:15,359 --> 01:16:19,012
Mother, who am I treating?
Do you see a man here anywhere?

820
01:16:19,013 --> 01:16:22,182
No, I don't.
And I think it's a problem.

821
01:16:25,890 --> 01:16:27,896
I don't understand why
you don't come home.

822
01:16:27,897 --> 01:16:29,712
I like it here, Mom.

823
01:16:31,838 --> 01:16:34,565
You're not exactly bubbling over with happiness.

824
01:16:34,566 --> 01:16:37,558
It's a life, Mom.  Not a hayride.

825
01:16:38,123 --> 01:16:43,041
Honey, what is this?  Oh my gosh!
The police are here!

826
01:16:43,042 --> 01:16:44,785
Yes, I see the police, Mother.

827
01:16:50,359 --> 01:16:52,017
What the fuck is goin' on?
What the hell is goin' on?

828
01:16:52,018 --> 01:16:53,119
Hold it.

829
01:16:53,298 --> 01:16:55,041
Jane, what are you doing here?

830
01:16:55,266 --> 01:16:58,038
I called her.
I thought that she should know.

831
01:16:58,039 --> 01:16:59,614
Know what?

832
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:01,452
He's arresting me.

833
01:17:01,453 --> 01:17:02,901
What for?

834
01:17:02,902 --> 01:17:05,603
You know what for, Robin.
Pittsburgh.

835
01:17:05,604 --> 01:17:06,481
You told him?

836
01:17:06,482 --> 01:17:12,783
Yes, she told me.  And I take this name seriously.
I cannot tell a lie.

837
01:17:12,784 --> 01:17:16,125
That was Washington, shmuck!

838
01:17:16,126 --> 01:17:23,299
Whatever.  Anyway, I'm going to stand by Holly
one-hundred percent.  But I am sworn to uphold the law.

839
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:29,559
And I don't believe I would be any use to her
whatsoever if I broke my oath.  Now would I?

840
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:31,535
He really loves me.

841
01:17:31,536 --> 01:17:35,261
Oh yeah, I can tell by the manacles on your wrists!

842
01:17:38,262 --> 01:17:41,994
Don't say a word.  Not to him,
not to anybody.  We'll get you a lawyer.

843
01:17:43,395 --> 01:17:44,839
I'll miss you guys.

844
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:13,487
Now I promise you that they are going to treat her right.
They know that she is going to be my future wife.

845
01:18:16,588 --> 01:18:18,400
Son-of-a-bitch!

846
01:18:19,687 --> 01:18:23,996
Honey, what in the world is going on?

847
01:18:24,164 --> 01:18:28,166
I feel like I've just seen
"America's Most Wanted" in person.

848
01:18:28,167 --> 01:18:29,909
This has got to be the mother.

849
01:18:29,910 --> 01:18:31,629
Jane, please.

850
01:18:31,630 --> 01:18:34,059
Yes, I am.
And who are you?

851
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:37,562
I'm the lesbo.  I used to live here
until your daughter threw me out.

852
01:18:37,563 --> 01:18:38,569
Well, I'm sorry.

853
01:18:38,570 --> 01:18:39,567
Mother.

854
01:18:39,162 --> 01:18:45,287
Yeah, me too.  But I think this makes her real happy,
because now she's got the whole house to herself.

855
01:18:45,288 --> 01:18:48,074
Cut it out.
You're just being mean.

856
01:18:48,248 --> 01:18:51,534
Jane, stop!  You know,
she's going to need our help.

857
01:18:52,428 --> 01:18:54,538
No, not our help.
I'll take care of this myself.

858
01:18:57,215 --> 01:18:58,716
Fine.  Fine.  Fine.  Fine.  Fine.

859
01:19:01,672 --> 01:19:03,340
They do that now, don't they?

860
01:19:03,341 --> 01:19:04,377
What?

861
01:19:04,378 --> 01:19:06,541
Call themselves "lesbos."

862
01:19:06,542 --> 01:19:07,532
Oh, Mom.

863
01:19:07,533 --> 01:19:10,554
And she makes it sound like a compliment.

864
01:19:12,355 --> 01:19:17,528
She wants to confess.  She says she doesn't
want to bring a child into a world of lies.

865
01:19:17,529 --> 01:19:19,811
Well you have nothing to worry
about Henry.  Holly has promised me

866
01:19:19,812 --> 01:19:24,214
that she is going to keep her mouth shut
as long as does not have to lie out loud.

867
01:19:24,215 --> 01:19:27,133
We wouldn't even be here if wasn't for you, you brown-nosin' putz!

868
01:19:27,134 --> 01:19:28,603
I took an oath, Jane.

869
01:19:28,604 --> 01:19:33,041
Yeah, you took a fucking oath, man.  Now were stuck here
in Pittsburgh and Holly's on trial because of your oath!

870
01:19:33,042 --> 01:19:34,665
So what exactly do they have?

871
01:19:34,666 --> 01:19:38,702
Nothing.  Except for Abe's testimony
and that's just hearsay.

872
01:19:38,703 --> 01:19:39,742
That is the truth.

873
01:19:39,743 --> 01:19:44,556
Oh, shut up!  Nobody wants to hear the truth.
But aside from that, what do they have?

874
01:19:44,557 --> 01:19:47,474
They...they have the Polaroid.

875
01:19:48,675 --> 01:19:50,545
The Polaroid?

876
01:19:50,546 --> 01:19:53,705
Yes.  I mentioned that I had seen a snapshot.

877
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:58,423
It's on the list of exhibits.  I mean, come on.
What the hell can they do with that?

878
01:19:58,424 --> 01:20:05,395
Cold blooded.  Cruel.  Inhuman.

879
01:20:05,396 --> 01:20:09,553
What words would you use to describe a woman
who posed and took this photograph?

880
01:20:09,554 --> 01:20:19,789
This is a photograph of a man who in a few short hours will be dead
from wound inflicted by this woman that you see before you.

881
01:20:19,790 --> 01:20:24,674
...and not surprisingly, everything that you say...
everything that you say tends to exonerate your friend.

882
01:20:24,675 --> 01:20:26,186
Sorry.  It's just the truth.

883
01:20:26,187 --> 01:20:28,209
And perhaps not coincidentally,
it tends to exonerate you.

884
01:20:28,210 --> 01:20:29,585
There are no charges against me.

885
01:20:29,586 --> 01:20:30,879
Yet.

886
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:35,644
Oh, come on.  Your Honor, is he allowed
to just intimidate me like this?

887
01:20:35,645 --> 01:20:37,564
Mr. Massarelli, please.

888
01:20:37,565 --> 01:20:40,133
Oh, I apologize your Honor.
It was unintentional.

889
01:20:40,134 --> 01:20:44,311
What is the nature of your friendship
with Ms. Holly Pulchik?

890
01:20:44,312 --> 01:20:46,129
Excuse me?

891
01:20:46,130 --> 01:20:51,262
Oh, I'm sorry.  Let me rephrase the question.
How would you characterize your friendship?

892
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:58,459
I would call her my friend.  I mean, come on.
What is this "friendship" stuff about?

893
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:02,748
That's precisely what I'm trying to find out.
Let me put this delicately to avoid offending the court.

894
01:21:02,749 --> 01:21:06,543
Is there a "romantic" character to your friendship?

895
01:21:06,544 --> 01:21:07,854
Objection!

896
01:21:07,855 --> 01:21:11,222
Over ruled.
You may proceed Mr. Massarelli.

897
01:21:11,223 --> 01:21:16,595
To repeat Ms. Deluca, is there a romantic character
to your friendship with the defendant?

898
01:21:16,596 --> 01:21:18,764
No, Mr. Massaralli, there is not.

899
01:21:18,765 --> 01:21:20,026
Massarelli.

900
01:21:20,027 --> 01:21:21,848
I'm sorry.
Unintentional.

901
01:21:21,849 --> 01:21:25,159
You are, however, one of these gay women that
we read about, or do you prefer lesbian?

902
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:26,286
Do I prefer them to you?

903
01:21:26,287 --> 01:21:27,038
Are you gay?

904
01:21:27,039 --> 01:21:27,822
Do I look gay?

905
01:21:27,823 --> 01:21:28,518
Your Honor?

906
01:21:28,519 --> 01:21:29,869
Please answer the question.

907
01:21:29,870 --> 01:21:32,975
Are-you-gay?

908
01:21:32,976 --> 01:21:40,844
Yes-I-am.  And I'm sure you hear that women all the time.
And in my case, it happens to be true.

909
01:21:42,345 --> 01:21:45,562
She's scared shitless,
just like I would be after today.

910
01:21:45,563 --> 01:21:49,942
No, I don't want you to do that, Anna, okay?
I don't want you to do that.

911
01:21:49,943 --> 01:21:54,877
I'll call you tonight, all right?
Good-bye.

912
01:21:55,678 --> 01:21:57,926
You shmuck!

913
01:21:58,788 --> 01:21:59,337
You did your best.

914
01:21:59,338 --> 01:22:02,055
Yeah, I did, which is more
than I can say for you.

915
01:22:02,087 --> 01:22:04,369
Justice is hard.

916
01:22:04,990 --> 01:22:08,484
Justice?  You call this justice?

917
01:22:08,485 --> 01:22:12,914
This girl protects herself against some marauding
asshole who uses her body as a punching bag,

918
01:22:12,915 --> 01:22:14,361
and she's going to jail?

919
01:22:14,362 --> 01:22:17,447
You call that justice!
Is that what you want?

920
01:22:17,448 --> 01:22:22,781
I want Holly to be my wife.
I want us to be a family.

921
01:22:22,782 --> 01:22:24,192
Where, in the joint?

922
01:22:25,957 --> 01:22:31,057
I don't know that.  But I do know that
there is no kind of family without the law.

923
01:22:31,058 --> 01:22:32,655
None whatsoever.

924
01:22:32,656 --> 01:22:37,878
Because the law that governs this society
is the same law that holds the family together.

925
01:22:37,879 --> 01:22:43,010
Where did you read that?
On the side of a Cheerios box?

926
01:22:46,411 --> 01:22:49,511
You think I love her less, now.

927
01:22:51,377 --> 01:22:53,777
But I don't.

928
01:22:56,788 --> 01:23:00,788
I love her more.
And that is why I had to do this.

929
01:23:09,994 --> 01:23:12,557
Come on.  Come on!  Come on!

930
01:23:24,035 --> 01:23:26,361
And they lived happily ever after.

931
01:23:26,362 --> 01:23:27,647
Did I wake you?

932
01:23:27,648 --> 01:23:32,397
No.  I was just looking for a drink.

933
01:23:32,398 --> 01:23:33,941
There's beer.

934
01:23:33,942 --> 01:23:37,518
No.  I had some bourbon from the plane,
but I seem to have finished it.

935
01:23:41,136 --> 01:23:43,712
What are you doing?

936
01:23:44,045 --> 01:23:49,318
I thought somehow if I made this trip again,
we'd all be here at the end like this.

937
01:23:49,319 --> 01:23:56,731
Oh, Honey.  Nobody was happy in these pictures.
Except maybe you.

938
01:23:56,732 --> 01:24:02,414
Tommy was already so frail.
And your father....

939
01:24:02,415 --> 01:24:03,951
Well, you loved him, didn't you?

940
01:24:05,712 --> 01:24:14,710
Yes, I did.  With all my heart.  But I lost him.
And Tommy, too.  And that's that.

941
01:24:14,711 --> 01:24:18,537
You just have to let it go, Robin.
Just let it go.

942
01:24:18,538 --> 01:24:20,864
I can't.

943
01:24:20,865 --> 01:24:23,029
Well, you have to, Darling.

944
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:28,850
Because it's never going to come out any differently,
no matter how many times you make this trip.

945
01:24:28,851 --> 01:24:29,848
I know that.

946
01:24:33,101 --> 01:24:42,264
When we lost Tommy, well,
your father just couldn't live with that.

947
01:24:42,265 --> 01:24:45,726
I don't blame him.

948
01:24:45,727 --> 01:24:54,042
It's not right, losing your children.
Children are supposed to live after you.

949
01:24:54,043 --> 01:25:00,160
Oh, Honey.  Are you crying?  Oh my gosh.

950
01:25:00,161 --> 01:25:09,811
Do you know, I don't ever remember you crying.
Even when you were a baby.  Isn't that funny?

951
01:25:15,016 --> 01:25:17,030
I'm sorry.

952
01:25:21,127 --> 01:25:25,094
I know that you're not well, Darling.

953
01:25:25,095 --> 01:25:28,061
I don't know what it is
and I don't want to know.

954
01:25:28,062 --> 01:25:34,010
But I know you'll get better.
You were always the strong one.

955
01:25:34,011 --> 01:25:41,749
I can't lose you.
I can't just lose everybody.

956
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:49,235
I do the best I can, Honey.
I know it's not enough, and I'm sorry.

957
01:25:49,236 --> 01:25:55,520
But that's what you get in life, you know?
You get whoever you end up with.

958
01:25:55,521 --> 01:26:01,973
Whoever is willing to stick by you and fight
for you when everyone else is gone.

959
01:26:01,974 --> 01:26:09,448
And it ain't always who you expect.
But you just have to make do.

960
01:26:09,449 --> 01:26:12,552
I'm not complaining, Mom.

961
01:26:12,553 --> 01:26:17,793
"Never complain.  Never explain."
Katherine Hepburn.

962
01:26:17,794 --> 01:26:21,837
She said that in Redbook last month.
It's a good motto, isn't it?

963
01:26:25,385 --> 01:26:28,233
The best I can do is to pretend
like you never testified.

964
01:26:28,234 --> 01:26:29,935
Just go on like it never happened.

965
01:26:29,936 --> 01:26:32,031
Go on to what?

966
01:26:32,032 --> 01:26:33,529
Honestly?  I don't know.

967
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:48,235
All right, this is the situation.

968
01:26:48,236 --> 01:26:51,641
I am still angry.  I do not forgive you for anything.

969
01:26:51,642 --> 01:26:54,008
And I don't want to talk about it.

970
01:26:54,009 --> 01:26:55,294
Anna filled me in.

971
01:26:55,295 --> 01:27:00,949
She told me everything I needed to know
about the trial so far, and I know I can help.

972
01:27:00,950 --> 01:27:04,148
Because even if I can't,
I couldn't make it any worse.

973
01:27:04,149 --> 01:27:09,265
And Holly is just as much my responsibility
as everyone else's, and so are you.

974
01:27:09,266 --> 01:27:15,281
Because you are my family
and I love you.

975
01:27:15,282 --> 01:27:21,644
Now, I feel fine.  My T-cells are over
a hundred and I'm rarin' to go.

976
01:27:21,645 --> 01:27:31,131
So, unless you want to waste time being stubborn,
I suggest we get me on the stand as soon as possible.

977
01:27:49,732 --> 01:27:53,757
You expect us to believe that the defendant,
pregnant with this man's child

978
01:27:53,758 --> 01:27:56,599
would leave him and never look back?

979
01:27:56,600 --> 01:28:01,862
It was over.  He beat her and abused her.
I saw.  I saw how he treated her.

980
01:28:01,863 --> 01:28:04,273
But not to call.  Not to leave an address
so he could forward her mail.

981
01:28:04,274 --> 01:28:08,606
And practical reasons aside, let's just say
that she did strike a blow for self-defense.

982
01:28:08,607 --> 01:28:14,188
Let's just assume.  And she decides to
let him stew in his own juices for a while.

983
01:28:14,189 --> 01:28:20,482
But a couple of hours, a few days later she realizes,
"But he's my little baby's daddy.

984
01:28:20,483 --> 01:28:24,000
And you know what?  He's not so bad.
And sure, maybe he's got a temper."

985
01:28:24,001 --> 01:28:27,098
But all she knows is that she needs him.
She needs to call him.

986
01:28:27,099 --> 01:28:33,576
But it was over between them.
I know you think a girl like her,

987
01:28:33,577 --> 01:28:38,813
the most important thing in her life is a man,
but she didn't need him.  She had us.

988
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:41,244
Well, I hardly think that you're a replacement for a father.

989
01:28:41,245 --> 01:28:48,564
I don't know what it is, but, there's
something that goes on between women.

990
01:28:48,565 --> 01:28:52,667
You men know that because it's the same for you.

991
01:28:52,668 --> 01:29:02,717
I'm not saying one sex is better than the other.
I'm just saying, like speaks to like.

992
01:29:02,718 --> 01:29:12,758
Love, or whatever, doesn't always keep,
so you find out what does, if you're lucky.

993
01:29:12,759 --> 01:29:17,408
Well, thank you for that very illuminating
view of the war between the sexes.

994
01:29:17,409 --> 01:29:19,595
Are you a lesbian, too, Ms. Nickerson?

995
01:29:19,596 --> 01:29:25,546
No, sir.  But at times I understand the inclination.

996
01:29:25,547 --> 01:29:29,150
Now, suppose there is this bond between women.
Suppose men are disposable.

997
01:29:29,151 --> 01:29:30,902
I didn't say that!  I...

998
01:29:30,903 --> 01:29:38,770
Wouldn't you say anything, wouldn't you do anything to keep
your sister, keep your bosom-buddy, so to speak, out of jail?

999
01:29:38,771 --> 01:29:40,954
I'm under oath.  I wouldn't perjure myself.

1000
01:29:40,955 --> 01:29:54,173
And, just for the record...You didn't know...You didn't know until
the police told you, that this man was dead of his wounds?

1001
01:29:54,174 --> 01:29:57,457
If I'm lying, may I be struck down
with some terrible disease.

1002
01:30:01,258 --> 01:30:09,722
Good news!  Got an offer.  Involuntary manslaughter
with extenuating circumstances.

1003
01:30:09,723 --> 01:30:13,235
One to two years, parole after six months.

1004
01:30:13,236 --> 01:30:19,426
I got you minimum security in Arizona,
two hours from home, and good medical care.

1005
01:30:19,427 --> 01:30:23,055
I'd hate to have my baby in jail.

1006
01:30:23,056 --> 01:30:25,572
What are the chances for an acquittal?

1007
01:30:25,573 --> 01:30:29,582
Well, he's dead as a result of her actions,
and juries want to make someone pay for that.

1008
01:30:29,583 --> 01:30:34,732
She didn't testify in her own defense,
and I'm not sure how much good you did her.

1009
01:30:34,733 --> 01:30:42,694
I mean, my baby will have a mother who's a convicted felon.
I don't know.  What do you think?

1010
01:30:42,695 --> 01:30:45,483
Well, by the time...

1011
01:30:45,484 --> 01:30:51,218
I mean Abe.  What do you think about that, Babe?

1012
01:30:51,219 --> 01:30:56,440
I think that you should take it.
And I will keep the baby until you get out.

1013
01:30:56,441 --> 01:30:58,367
Yeah, but...

1014
01:30:58,368 --> 01:30:59,982
That's what I'll do, then.

1015
01:30:59,983 --> 01:31:01,725
Fine.  I'll tell them we'll take it.

1016
01:31:08,587 --> 01:31:10,642
I love you.

1017
01:31:10,643 --> 01:31:12,063
I gotta get in there with you.

1018
01:31:12,064 --> 01:31:13,113
Do you?

1019
01:31:13,114 --> 01:31:16,902
I want you so much.

1020
01:31:16,903 --> 01:31:19,430
Could we have a minute?

1021
01:31:19,431 --> 01:31:21,500
Yeah.  We'll see you later.

1022
01:31:35,944 --> 01:31:38,157
Oh Abe.  I missed you so much!

1023
01:31:41,142 --> 01:31:45,507
Well, so much for the bonds between women.

1024
01:31:45,508 --> 01:31:47,240
You can't fight that.

1025
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:58,332
You were pretty good in there.
What ever happened to honesty is the best policy?

1026
01:31:58,333 --> 01:32:00,735
You don't want to go overboard.

1027
01:32:08,697 --> 01:32:14,267
You know, I've been thinkin' and thinkin'
and thinkin' about this and I want to say it.

1028
01:32:14,268 --> 01:32:18,933
I'm really, really sorry.  I truly am.

1029
01:32:18,934 --> 01:32:24,096
Yeah, me, too.  I get so angry so fast.

1030
01:32:24,097 --> 01:32:42,002
It's just it's...lonely.  Between me and everybody else there's
all this space all the time and it gets bigger and bigger and...

1031
01:32:42,003 --> 01:32:57,684
I'm on one side, you know...and, I'm screaming and
the one person I think I'm holding is afraid of it, too.

1032
01:33:02,785 --> 01:33:05,965
I'm holding you.

1033
01:33:10,566 --> 01:33:18,617
There will not be anymore lies between us,
not even for my own good.

1034
01:33:18,618 --> 01:33:20,292
No ma'am.

1035
01:33:20,281 --> 01:33:21,382
Good.

1036
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:24,182
I'm gonna go call Anna, she's got a...

1037
01:33:27,193 --> 01:33:30,231
What's the matter?
Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Abe!  ABE!

1038
01:33:39,007 --> 01:33:43,128
Elaine?  Jane.  Listen.  I'm sorry to wake you

1039
01:33:43,129 --> 01:33:46,634
but we're back in Tucson
and she's in the hospital.

1040
01:35:05,906 --> 01:35:09,110
What curse, Honey?  Who?

1041
01:35:09,111 --> 01:35:11,087
One of my friends.

1042
01:35:11,088 --> 01:35:15,995
Remember when I came to see you,
you said there was a curse on a friend of mine?

1043
01:35:15,996 --> 01:35:19,082
It's my friend, Robin.
She's...

1044
01:35:19,083 --> 01:35:21,577
Look, you know, I don't believe in this stuff.

1045
01:35:21,578 --> 01:35:24,648
You know that.  I just thought
it couldn't hurt to come and see you.

1046
01:35:24,649 --> 01:35:29,766
Oh, Robin.  That's the girl with AIDS.  Anna's friend.

1047
01:35:29,767 --> 01:35:32,047
She's my friend.

1048
01:35:32,048 --> 01:35:36,831
Oh, boy uh, let's see...

1049
01:35:45,032 --> 01:35:46,201
So can you do it?

1050
01:35:46,359 --> 01:35:48,366
Do what?

1051
01:35:48,358 --> 01:35:49,561
Take the curse off of her.
You said you could...

1052
01:35:51,758 --> 01:35:53,468
It's AIDS, honey.

1053
01:35:54,828 --> 01:35:59,854
I know that, but right now it's just a lung infection, see, and...

1054
01:35:59,855 --> 01:36:05,451
I don't want a miracle.
I just want to give her a 51-49 shot.

1055
01:36:05,452 --> 01:36:10,475
I mean look, I brought money.
I could pay you right now.

1056
01:36:12,076 --> 01:36:15,855
Pay when it works.  I can't promise anything.

1057
01:36:24,039 --> 01:36:25,729
Don't wake her up.

1058
01:36:25,730 --> 01:36:30,454
Just doing my job.

1059
01:36:30,455 --> 01:36:32,676
Is that a cold?

1060
01:36:32,677 --> 01:36:36,001
She can't afford an infection.
I'll have to mask you.

1061
01:36:36,002 --> 01:36:39,656
Are you blind?  Can't you see
she's been crying?  It's her mother.

1062
01:36:39,657 --> 01:36:43,605
People think that they're being nice but
they come here with colds and it's not a nice...

1063
01:36:43,606 --> 01:36:46,796
It's not a goddamn cold.
Don't be such a hoo-hoo!

1064
01:36:46,797 --> 01:36:48,300
And what's a hoo-hoo?

1065
01:36:48,301 --> 01:36:53,394
It's a cunt, Dear.
Now why don't you leave us alone?

1066
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:18,560
Tommy?  Tommy?

1067
01:37:28,426 --> 01:37:30,523
Hey.  It's just me.

1068
01:37:40,316 --> 01:37:41,754
Where's Mom?

1069
01:37:43,862 --> 01:37:46,442
She had to go back to the house.

1070
01:37:47,138 --> 01:37:48,935
Will you call her?

1071
01:37:49,971 --> 01:37:51,471
Sure.

1072
01:38:01,606 --> 01:38:04,606
Yeah, hi.  Uh, she's asking for you.

1073
01:38:13,984 --> 01:38:16,684
Do you want me to get a doctor?

1074
01:38:20,519 --> 01:38:22,034
No.  No.

1075
01:38:33,352 --> 01:38:37,067
I had a crush on a woman once.

1076
01:38:38,509 --> 01:38:40,225
I was ten.

1077
01:38:41,226 --> 01:38:44,228
That's when I had crushes on boys.

1078
01:38:46,770 --> 01:38:48,882
She was a strawberry blonde.

1079
01:38:51,838 --> 01:38:54,050
That's what my mom called her.

1080
01:38:55,597 --> 01:39:02,609
She was a baby-sitter at the hotel we stayed
at... right before my Dad went to Vietnam.

1081
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:08,752
She was beautiful.
Strawberry blonde.

1082
01:39:11,404 --> 01:39:13,584
I used to be a strawberry blonde, too.

1083
01:39:20,705 --> 01:39:23,155
It was me you loved, wasn't it?

1084
01:39:27,391 --> 01:39:28,698
Yeah.

1085
01:39:31,883 --> 01:39:33,190
Still.

1086
01:39:36,867 --> 01:39:39,876
Well, I loved you, too.

1087
01:39:46,577 --> 01:39:52,293
I don't want a funeral, but Mom will.

1088
01:39:52,294 --> 01:39:59,507
But it's got to be here.
Don't let her take me back to San Diego.

1089
01:40:03,308 --> 01:40:09,223
And afterwards, have a big party at the house.  Okay?

1090
01:40:15,624 --> 01:40:16,862
Big party.

1091
01:40:33,551 --> 01:40:35,083
A big party.

1092
01:40:55,878 --> 01:40:58,331
You can do it!  Push!  Push!
Come on Holly, you can do it!

1093
01:41:01,835 --> 01:41:04,288
Push right into it. Take a deep breath.
Good!  Perfect!  Perfect!  Perfect!

1094
01:41:07,249 --> 01:41:10,289
Give us a real good push now....
The head is coming.

1095
01:42:01,432 --> 01:42:05,135
I wanted to be here to help her
with the breathing and everything.

1096
01:42:05,136 --> 01:42:07,693
Next time.  Next time.
Have you ever seen one of these things?

1097
01:42:07,694 --> 01:42:09,028
They're really ugly.

1098
01:42:09,029 --> 01:42:10,571
Where are they?

1099
01:42:10,572 --> 01:42:12,819
Let's go.  Whoa, wait a minute!
Come on, man!

1100
01:42:20,008 --> 01:42:25,018
Firstad.  Mitchell.  Pulchik.

1101
01:42:36,260 --> 01:42:38,851
Don't look at me.

1102
01:42:50,218 --> 01:42:51,285
Welcome back!

1103
01:42:50,954 --> 01:42:53,460
You made it.  You're back home.

1104
01:43:06,939 --> 01:43:08,946
Isn't she beautiful?

1105
01:43:08,026 --> 01:43:11,750
Hi, little one.  Hello.  Welcome.
Welcome Mary Todd.

1106
01:44:28,047 --> 01:44:30,428
Push it right out.

1107
01:44:52,691 --> 01:44:56,452
It was rough goin' in there.
But she managed to pull herself through, you know.

1108
01:44:56,453 --> 01:45:01,112
And the next day the Pentamidine kicked in, so....

1109
01:45:01,113 --> 01:45:03,416
What are her T-cells now?

1110
01:45:03,417 --> 01:45:07,421
Uh, they're about 35.
They were under 20 before.

1111
01:45:09,822 --> 01:45:13,714
She just...she doesn't look good.

1112
01:45:13,715 --> 01:45:16,145
She looks great.

1113
01:45:20,283 --> 01:45:25,373
Everyone, welcome Holly home,
with her new baby and her new husband Abe.

1114
01:45:28,699 --> 01:45:31,600
We're all glad to be here with our friends.

1115
01:45:31,601 --> 01:45:38,790
And I want you right now, ladies and gentlemen,
to put your hands together and give a round of warm applause,

1116
01:45:38,791 --> 01:45:44,019
to 1983's fourth runner-up in the
"Star Search" talent competition!

1117
01:45:44,020 --> 01:45:47,720
No!  No!  No!  Jane!  Jane!
It was third runner-up, not fourth.

1118
01:45:47,721 --> 01:45:52,709
I told her.  Fourth was this terrible
little boy tap dancer with pimples.

1119
01:45:52,710 --> 01:45:56,597
He only got that far because he cheated.
I mean, that is the only reason that I...

1120
01:45:56,598 --> 01:45:58,148
Elaine.

1121
01:45:58,649 --> 01:46:00,309
What?

1122
01:46:00,310 --> 01:46:01,991
Shut up.

1123
01:46:01,992 --> 01:46:03,492
Jerry!

1124
01:49:23,474 --> 01:49:25,485
Ready to go?

1125
01:49:26,484 --> 01:49:29,559
Okay.  But you better be back for Christmas
because Mary Todd's expecting you.

1126
01:49:29,560 --> 01:49:31,048
Yeah, I will.

1127
01:49:31,049 --> 01:49:34,037
You make sure you call me as soon as you get to L.A.
I want to know how the audition goes.

1128
01:49:34,038 --> 01:49:35,604
Okay, Mom!

1129
01:50:30,137 --> 01:50:35,203
