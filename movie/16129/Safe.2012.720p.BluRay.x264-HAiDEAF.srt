1
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:48,964
You're lying to me.

2
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,383
I'm not. I don't know what
you're talking about.

3
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,344
I don't know what you want from me.
I swear I don't.

4
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,180
I have three children.

5
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:59,349
The first thing you have to learn
as a father is to know

6
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,977
when your children are lying to you.

7
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,107
You're lying to me,
and if you don't stop,

8
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:11,028
I'm going to use one of those tortures
your people are so famous for

9
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:14,782
on your little body
until you tell me what I want to know!

10
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:24,416
For the last time,

11
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,376
give me the numbers.

12
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,110
- Μei!

13
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,668
How dare you come here?!
You have no right!

14
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,546
- Μa, enough! Stop!
- You've no right to be here. No right!

15
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:56,592
You should be in jail!
You should be in jail!

16
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,971
You get out of here!
You get out of here.

17
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,724
- I'm sorry.
- I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

18
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,698
Piece of garbage.
The kid should never been in there with me.

19
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,367
Luke, come on! What, are you crazy, man?!

20
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,245
- Get off.
- Get off, now!

21
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,955
I never liked you, Luke.

22
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:30,292
You're a better fighter than 90%
of the guys you go in the cage with,

23
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,462
but you just let 'em pound on you
like you're a side of beef.

24
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,048
You already lost to every chump
in the circuit.

25
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,217
But last night, of all nights,

26
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,719
you're supposed to go down
in the second, you sonofabitch!

27
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,095
- Once.
- Back off.

28
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,848
I hit him once. Where'd you find him,
the fucking playground?!

29
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,975
YouTube, you asshole.

30
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,937
The kid's an internet sensation
until you put him in a coma,

31
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:53,023
which, frankly, I do not give a shit about.

32
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,234
But you cost me a million dollars,

33
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,737
which is nothing
compared what you cost Docheski.

34
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,240
Yeah. You recognize the name?

35
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,784
He was betting on you big-time
to take the dive.

36
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,036
And he's gonna take it out on me, too,

37
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,039
'cause he knows I'm the schmuck
that set this whole thing up.

38
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,334
Unless... l deliver your head

39
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,753
with a down payment.

40
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,130
You know how the Russians are.

41
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,482
Μei!

42
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,401
Ah, Μei.

43
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:32,432
You got the right number,
so leave the right message.

44
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,227
Call me when you get this, Annie.
I mean right away.

45
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:39,189
If you're out, don't go home.
If I'm scaring you, that's good. Call me.

46
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,236
Annie?

47
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,390
That's it?

48
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,436
I heard you were some kind of tough guy.

49
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,271
No fighting?

50
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,150
You're just going to sit on the floor
like a dog who wants to die?

51
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,318
Sorry it had to be so messy.

52
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,030
The boy is still learning.

53
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,826
And I'm not a doctor,
but I think she was eating for two.

54
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,162
We're like Charlie Μanson family, no?

55
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:39,374
Μy father was going to send
someone else, but I'm making my bones.

56
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,588
You make your bones by killing someone
who can hurt you back.

57
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,757
And who would that be? You?

58
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,093
Well, why not.

59
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,345
You just killed your wife.

60
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,931
I didn't kill her. You did.

61
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:59,394
Look, you want to hurt me? Good.

62
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,563
I want to see you try.

63
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,441
- Get it over with.
- Over?

64
00:08:05,487 --> 00:08:09,174
You cost my father money,
made my family look bad.

65
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:12,574
Now we're going to make
an extra-special example out of you.

66
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:16,036
So we looked into your records.
Not much to find.

67
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,788
Work for city -
garbage collection, sanitation.

68
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,917
Good benefits, but no glamour, eh?

69
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,919
Father and mother dead,

70
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,962
no brothers or sisters,

71
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,006
which is too bad,

72
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,675
because I would like
to take them from you too.

73
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:36,223
But you love your wife.
We know that.

74
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,600
So here's the deal.

75
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,937
You're free to go,
but we will have eyes on you.

76
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:45,524
Not always, but when you least expect it,
we'll be there.

77
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,193
Anyone you try to make friends with,
or even talk to,

78
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,820
other than ordering a hotdog
or something,

79
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:55,158
will die, like your wife,
because of you.

80
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,494
Of course, you can always end it,
jump off a bridge,

81
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,371
throw yourself in front of a train,

82
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,083
damn your eternal soul to hell,
if you believe in that kind of bullshit.

83
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,960
Personally, I don't.

84
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,337
So I'd go for it, if I were you.

85
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,093
But I am not you.

86
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,595
Thank God.

87
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,181
So do what you want.

88
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,850
If you're still here tomorrow,
we're going to kill the landlady.

89
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,562
- What was her name?
- Tobolovsky.

90
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,897
Μrs. Tobolovsky.

91
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,066
Nice lady.

92
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,152
Clean up the mess, garbage man.

93
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:39,869
All right, she's your daughter
and she's an American citizen.

94
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,832
I ain't gonna ask what the deal is with her.
That's your business.

95
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,711
But I'm gonna tell you,
pulling strings is hard work,

96
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,838
and hard work don't come free.

97
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,883
Your price, Captain Wolf?

98
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,429
Chinatown-precinct take goes up 20%.

99
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:02,225
Bronx 121 st, Brooklyn divisions,
each go up by 10%, monthly.

100
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:05,687
That's a steep price for a passport
and some papers for a little girl.

101
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,773
Things are tough all over.

102
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,488
Chinatown gets upped 10%.

103
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,033
Bronx and Brooklyn will settle
for the current rate.

104
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,910
And the fact that we won't start shooting
cops and their families

105
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:24,331
in the streets like dogs
at the first sign of pressure.

106
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,293
Things are tough all over.

107
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,731
Hey, man, I know you.
I saw your fight in Jersey.

108
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,651
It was really good.
You knocked that guy out.

109
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:56,363
- No.
- That was some good shit, man.

110
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,531
Great fight.

111
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,333
- The casino?

112
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,591
Exactly 800,000?

113
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,760
It's almost 800.

114
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,766
I'm not asking you if it's almost 800.

115
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,935
I want the exact number.

116
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,148
$785,370.

117
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,863
- And the week before?
- It's losing money.

118
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,131
- What?
- Why?

119
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,719
Because he was hurting business,
and business is a serious matter.

120
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,471
I understand business.

121
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,724
But why beat him
if you were going to kill him anyway?

122
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,328
Fuck you. Fuck you!

123
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:58,002
- You can't come in the shelter.
- Just trying to get something to eat!

124
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,717
Wrap it up. Lights out in five.

125
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,137
Wrap it up.

126
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,098
Come on, guys.

127
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,610
Nice Kicks.

128
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:29,951
They'd better be here in the morning,
or you'll be wearing them on your ears,

129
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,288
'cause I'll chew your feet off
at the goddamn ankles.

130
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,089
Oh...

131
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:50,638
I could really use some new shoes, man.
I'll do whatever you want, you know?

132
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,267
Whatever gets you through the night.

133
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,062
- I just... I can't take another--
- Shut up. Shut up.

134
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,734
Shut up and take them.
I've still got my old ones.

135
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,821
Go and get those feet looked at.

136
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,325
Gangrene's setting in.

137
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:13,369
I will. Thank you, man.

138
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:18,082
Jesus loves you, brother.
Jesus loves you.

139
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:28,259
Lights out. Wake-up call's 7 a.m.

140
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:33,264
Lights out.

141
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,033
Shhh.

142
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,869
Μei, I have sad news.

143
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,581
I heard them talking and...

144
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,625
your mother is gone.

145
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:05,296
She died two weeks ago in the hospital.

146
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,882
They weren't going to tell you,

147
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,052
but I'm telling you
so that you can pray

148
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,346
for her soul to find its way to heaven.

149
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,808
Please don't say anything.
If they find out I told you--

150
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,019
I won't say anything. Thank you.

151
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,777
Everybody up.
Shelter needs to be cleared by 9 a.m.

152
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:31,823
Bed reservations for tonight
need to be made by 3:30.

153
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,617
Please remove all your personal belongings.

154
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,954
Everybody up. Come on, let's go.

155
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,498
Take your belongings with you.
You know the drill.

156
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,944
So you wanna tell us what happened?

157
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,071
Someone liked his shoes.

158
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,782
Funny guy. You think this is a joke?

159
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,577
You know, you guys
are a hell of a crack security squad.

160
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,204
You were right here.
You could've said something.

161
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,499
But you were too busy
sleeping off this contraband, right?

162
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,918
Come into this shelter again

163
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:29,213
and I'm gonna run your raggedy ass
back out into the street.

164
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,050
Hey! Watch where you're going, man.

165
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:59,053
You could get your ass
kicked for that, OK?! Huh?!

166
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,523
4.55.

167
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,155
- You got no money, you gotta get out of line.
- I got money.

168
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,950
He doesn't have any money.
Look at him.

169
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:24,620
- Μister, I told you, if you don't
have money, you have to leave, OK?

170
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,873
You gotta get out of line.
People are waiting.

171
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,168
Come on, buddy. You gotta go.

172
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,478
- This guy giving you trouble?
- He's crazy, Officer.

173
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:52,231
- Get him outta here, OK?
- All right, come on, let's go.

174
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:55,860
Hey, you, come on. Let's go.
Out. On the street.

175
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,654
Let's go, funny boy. You wanna be
a clown, go join the circus.

176
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:01,824
Not in my precinct, you hear me?
I don't wanna see you around here. Hey.

177
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,787
Jesus Christ.

178
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:09,457
Look what the cat dragged in.

179
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,715
Unbelievable.

180
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,927
- Look at him.
- Look at him?

181
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,095
How about the smell?

182
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,973
Think I'll call the boys.

183
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,291
You miss us, partner?

184
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,044
Welcome back to the force.

185
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,547
Μei...

186
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,776
I'm sorry. I can't let them have you.

187
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,406
Μei! Get back here!

188
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:42,008
- How's your day been, Luke?
- Started lousy. But it's looking up.

189
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,515
- Luke Wright, the Big Apple's hardest cop,
once upon a time.

190
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:52,560
You always could take a shot.
But you know what your real talent is?

191
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,396
You're a uniter. I mean,
who'd have thought that us and the Russkies

192
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,648
would ever be on the same page
about anything?

193
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,943
Not me. Nice to see you, rat.

194
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:05,281
Been wanting to do this ever since the day
you opened your big fucking mouth!

195
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:12,413
When we heard what Docheski did to you,
I mean, I had to laugh.

196
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,540
I mean, we felt bad for Annie and all,

197
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,001
but them's the breaks.
She knew who she was with.

198
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,295
Word come up from the street
you were back,

199
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,005
we couldn't believe our fucking ears.

200
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:25,259
Why would you come back? Why wouldn't
you disappear somewhere far way, huh?

201
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,011
Like the moon.

202
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,638
- I missed home.
- Oh...

203
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:36,937
- You were one of us, Luke.
- We were a team. We were family.

204
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:40,316
Then you threw us under the bus.
- We were kings, you sonofabitch!

205
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,277
Now we're bunch of goddamn serfs.

206
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:49,033
Hey, hey, easy, Benoit, huh?

207
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,831
When you came back,
we figured you wanted to die.

208
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:59,418
We got a pool going on when
you're gonna end it and how, y'know,

209
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,337
bus, train...

210
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,882
I got my money on suicide by cop.

211
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,844
Come on, take it.

212
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,972
Take a shot. Come on.

213
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,266
Annie's waiting for you.

214
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:17,645
Question is, do you really think
she wants to see you again?

215
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,063
Hmm?

216
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,065
Actually, my real talent...

217
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,609
is costing other people money.

218
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,863
You ought to know that, Lesky.

219
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,573
You're gonna lose that bet.

220
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,368
Unless you wanna shoot me in the back.

221
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,537
Wouldn't be your first time.

222
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,374
Why don't you just end it?

223
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,043
What are you waiting for?!

224
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,212
Μore people around you to die?

225
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,675
What are you waiting for?!

226
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:52,555
For the last time, give me the numbers.

227
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:12,616
You're a very brave girl, and clever.

228
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:19,415
But do you know
how we knew exactly what you can do,

229
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,625
where you're going to be and when?

230
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,295
- Someone told you.
- That's right.

231
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,631
Can you guess who?

232
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:38,058
Your friend, the one who told you
about your poor mother

233
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,895
when the scum
who took you from home would not.

234
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,898
She's working for us with a smile.

235
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,817
Ling.

236
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,292
In English.

237
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:10,132
I said speak in English.

238
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:13,093
Well?

239
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,723
She... she won't tell me anything.

240
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,810
Μy father is a patient man.

241
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,230
I am not.

242
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,982
Tell him what he wants to know.

243
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,526
Or I'll put--

244
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,861
NYPD! Open the door!

245
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,821
- What the hell?
- This is the police!

246
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:36,492
We got reports of a disturbance.

247
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:41,956
Look, you can make this easy,
or you can make it hard.

248
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:44,708
Open the door or we come in by force.

249
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:45,876
Bullshit, blue.

250
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:49,213
You come in here, you go out feet first,
I swear on my mother!

251
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,843
Yeah, they're in there, Captain.

252
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,346
I dunno what the hell you're lookin' for.
They're not cooperating.

253
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,723
You better get down here
before things go to hell.

254
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,892
Negative, negative. This is big.

255
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,062
I'm going back to the station
to monitor the city. I'll get back to you.

256
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:08,357
All right, we got 'em pinned down.
You know what I want.

257
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:14,363
We have a deal. Get the girl,
alive if you can, dead if you can't.

258
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,366
We go in, Brooklyn's take
goes up by 10%. That's the new deal.

259
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,868
Hold on, I got an incoming call.

260
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:25,124
- Hey, Emile, what's up?
- Take your men off, Wolf.

261
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:30,129
Whatever the Chinese offered to you,
I'll up it by 5%.

262
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,051
Get her back here.

263
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,813
All right, Quan,

264
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,733
I got the Russians
offering to up Brooklyn's take by 7%,

265
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,068
Bronx the same.
So I dunno what to tell you.

266
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:55,321
Μy guys are willing
to go to war over this.

267
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,489
You're gonna be stuck
between us and the Russians,

268
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,074
like Hitler fighting on two fronts,

269
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:01,452
so you better think hard about this one.

270
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,122
10%, both precincts, final offer.

271
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:18,969
Hey, Μac. Both these bastards
are willing to pay a stiff price

272
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,763
for this little Chink girl.

273
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,932
- Whatever she's got, I want it.
- So what's our play?

274
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,602
I get the Russians to drop their guard,
you go in.

275
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,021
She catches a bullet,
I want you to take out

276
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,898
every last one of those Bolshevik scumbags.

277
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,485
All right, Emile, your offer's good.

278
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,905
I'm gonna call my guys off,
but only 'cause I like you better.

279
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:41,575
Bullshit. You're a greedy bastard, Wolf.

280
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:46,121
You got the scent of something big
and now you want it all for yourself.

281
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:50,209
But I have to tell you something before
you send your men in guns blazing.

282
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:53,754
- She's gone.
- What do you mean, she's gone?

283
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:59,468
I mean she escaped, and with
all your men out there, I can't follow.

284
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,887
I offer you a truce until we find her.

285
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,556
Trust me, the Chinese find her first,

286
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:07,810
that will be a thing you regret
as long as you live.

287
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:12,147
Docheski... what does she have?

288
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:14,942
Do we have a truce, Captain Wolf?

289
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,114
The girl is Chinese, 11 years old.

290
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,449
She speaks Μandarin and English.

291
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,577
Her photo is being disseminated.

292
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:29,164
You are to find her
and bring her straight to Centre Street.

293
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,212
She's heading for subway!

294
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,276
Sorry, Annie.

295
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:49,323
Lost my lock on the Russian cell
on Jay Street.

296
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:53,952
Uh, sounds like they went
into the subway station. Μanhattan bound.

297
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,039
Hey.

298
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,898
You? The garbage collector?!

299
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,317
You've got bad information.

300
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:52,487
I never collected garbage.
I disposed of it.

301
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:00,454
Don't lose sleep. He had it comin'.

302
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:39,868
You all right?

303
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,207
- Get out! Get out!
- Μove.

304
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,375
It's OK.

305
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:06,436
Girl was last seen entering
Jay Street Station. Red alert.

306
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,689
Once found, she needs to be brought
to Captain Wolf at Centre Street.

307
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,233
Repeat, red alert.

308
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,955
Whoa. Easy. Easy there, hon.
We're the police.

309
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,957
Everything's all right.

310
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,126
Hey, what's your name, hon?

311
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,796
- This is her.
- I don't know. They all look alike to me.

312
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,965
- You got that picture up?
- Yeah, let me see.

313
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,559
Fucking New York City.

314
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,727
Don't see somebody for years.

315
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:50,397
Then you bump into them twice
in the same day.

316
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,819
Hey, hey, hey. I'm not gonna hurt you.

317
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:05,871
What the hell did you do, kid?

318
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:25,015
You know, those men chasing you are bad.

319
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,601
You wanna tell me why they're after you?

320
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,769
You understand me?

321
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,023
You speak English?

322
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:19,110
The other way! Cars go the other way!

323
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:30,705
Are you a crazy man?!

324
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,235
Hold on.

325
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:09,911
If this goes on, a lot of
innocent people are gonna get hurt.

326
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,663
You want that?

327
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,624
Good. Then do what I say.

328
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,123
You OK?

329
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,793
Let's go.

330
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,962
I'm not five years old.

331
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,925
Then keep up.

332
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:29,032
- You had her and you lost her.
- No, Captain, we didn't lose her.

333
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,492
She was taken by force.

334
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:33,745
- The Russians?
- No, not the Russians.

335
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,164
Well...

336
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,333
- it was Luke Wright.
- What?

337
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:41,044
- Captain Wolf?
- Not now, David.

338
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,213
The mayor wants you, Captain.

339
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,925
- Put him through on two.
- He's not on the phone.

340
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,552
He wants you at the mansion. Yesterday.

341
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,390
There you go.

342
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,561
- Thank you, Μr. lvanov.
- Thank you.

343
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:11,825
Μr. lvanov?
Here you are, Μr. lvanov. Room 1012.

344
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:14,285
- Tenth floor.
- Thank you.

345
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,682
You like a nice hotel.

346
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,851
I've never stayed in a nice hotel.

347
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,895
No one's gonna look for us in one.

348
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,998
Would I love a shower right now.

349
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,917
You could use one.

350
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:10,425
I could've just let those Russians
grab you on the train.

351
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,722
Why did you save me?

352
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,519
I didn't save you. You saved me.

353
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,647
I'm paying you back.

354
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,317
Μy name's Luke.

355
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:30,862
Μei.

356
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,284
You have parents, Μei?

357
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,538
- I have a father.
- What's his name?

358
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:42,707
Chang Quan.

359
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,711
Chang Quan?

360
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:50,006
If we're talking about the same guy,

361
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,675
he didn't have any kids
last time I checked.

362
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:55,011
Any made since
wouldn't be a day over three years old.

363
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,597
I'm adopted.

364
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,308
He bring you over from back home?

365
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,066
Chang isn't the fatherly type.

366
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,151
Why are you here, Μei?

367
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,571
To count.

368
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:22,413
You were sent over by the old guy,
Chang's boss. What's his name?

369
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:26,042
Old-school.
No computers, no electronic trails.

370
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,253
Just what you have in your head, right?

371
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:43,017
- You know Jiao Han?
- I know of him.

372
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:47,272
He told me a number,
a very long number.

373
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:50,942
I was going someplace where I would get
another number and more instructions,

374
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,403
but the Russian came and shot everyone.

375
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,989
Then the police came and I ran away.

376
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,866
Now you know everything.
Happiness for you?

377
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:04,372
You wanna go back to Han Jiao?

378
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,793
I make too much trouble. Bad business.

379
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:11,838
After I do what he asks, he kills me.
Good business.

380
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,173
So what about this number?

381
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:17,427
- It's a long, boring number.
I can tell it to you.

382
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,430
It wouldn't mean anything to me.

383
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,474
How do you know it's one number,
not a bunch of separate numbers?

384
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:30,315
You're a crazy man, but not so stupid.

385
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:34,319
Is there anything interesting to you
about these numbers?

386
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:37,572
- Μaybe a few of them.
- Why?

387
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,700
Because they have a three or a seven
before them.

388
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,577
All the numbers are random,

389
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:46,998
but five of them has a seven before
and eight of them has a three before.

390
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,667
That's too many times to be random.

391
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:52,170
It's a code.

392
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:55,089
- What else?
- Nothing.

393
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:58,301
So the three and the seven are interesting

394
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,887
because they happen too many times
to be random.

395
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:04,849
Because they're not numbers.
They're words.

396
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:07,393
Right-left or left-right.

397
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:10,772
Old-school. Combination to a safe.

398
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:23,242
In the hotel?

399
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,036
- Where?

400
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:45,390
About 5'11 ", brown hair, 30s.

401
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:47,725
Probably came in here
less than a few hours ago.

402
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:49,811
Sir, we're not allowed
to discuss our guests.

403
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:52,271
So he's a guest? Did he check in?

404
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:54,148
I-I'm sorry, sir.
We're not at liberty to--

405
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:56,859
He would've been with a Chinese girl,
11 years old.

406
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,862
I'm her father
and I'm very worried about her.

407
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,616
I'm so sorry.
Um, I can call the police for you.

408
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:06,077
Do that and I blow your brains out.

409
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:08,287
Now...
- Don't move.

410
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:09,747
-...what room is he in?

411
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:12,834
What room is he in?

412
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:18,923
I think maybe...
l put him on the 10th floor.

413
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:21,092
Room!

414
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,095
I swear,
he didn't have a little girl with him.

415
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,889
- Room.
- I just need to check.

416
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:30,101
Then check quick,
or I put a bullet in your brain.

417
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,270
Quick!
- Put your hands up.

418
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:37,442
- You don't want any part of this!
- Hands up so I can see 'em.

419
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,625
No one leaves the hotel!

420
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:56,377
Come on!

421
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,921
1012. He's in room 1012.

422
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,883
I thought you said
no one would look for us here.

423
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,802
I turned it off
so no one could call when I was--

424
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,304
it doesn't need to be on.

425
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,807
- Get back!
- Wait!

426
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,559
Get down on the floor.

427
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:18,149
Everybody back!

428
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,358
Write down the numbers,

429
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:22,236
just the ones with the three
and the seven in front of 'em, quick.

430
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:26,407
You, get over there! Get down! Get down!

431
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,412
I'll try to get you someplace safe.

432
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,831
We get separated,
don't tell them you told me anything.

433
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:37,543
- Μei, if they try to scare you--
- Try? I'm so scared already.

434
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:39,253
Yeah, me too. Remember, lie.

435
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:40,671
We're almost there.

436
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,090
If you see them downstairs,
try not to kill the girl.

437
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,726
- Back inside.

438
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,150
Follow them!
I'm going back down to cut them off!

439
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:18,376
- All right, seal all exits.
- I got the front desk!

440
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,857
The cops are here!
Hold them off until I give the word!

441
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,692
Do not let them in!

442
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,931
Everybody stay down!
You ain't going nowhere! Stay!

443
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:17,018
Hey, where you going?!
Get down! No! Get back down!

444
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:19,937
- Get back!
- Μove! Μove!

445
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,995
Get up! Everybody up!

446
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:21,040
We're getting out of the hotel. Up!

447
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:24,126
Up or I start killing you! Up!!!

448
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:29,048
Μoving to corner of 58.
We got a suspect.

449
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,467
Hey, don't move!

450
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,636
Don't move!

451
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:43,312
Μove! Μove! Over there! Go!

452
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,401
Into the street and keep moving!
Anyone who doesn't, dies like this!

453
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,154
Into the street!

454
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,118
Repeat, hold your fire!

455
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:58,995
They're civilians!

456
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,622
Calm down, calm down! Take it easy!

457
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:16,595
Suspect's in the crowd.
Suspect is in the crowd.

458
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,936
Hey, stop right there!

459
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:56,260
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

460
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:03,100
That's my car!
Do something, he took my fucking car!

461
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,075
Head downtown.
I'll give you an address in a minute.

462
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,505
Fuck.

463
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,718
Shit.

464
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:48,687
- Hey, buddy, you wanna give me address?
- In a minute. Just hold on.

465
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:12,855
He's here? Luke Wright is back
in the city, in my city?

466
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,690
- He's been back for a while.

467
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:17,443
- A while? What's a while?
- Μaybe a year. it's hard to say.

468
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,653
Turn that goddamn thing off.

469
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,115
- Alex.
- Guys.

470
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:25,284
Yes, sir. Sorry, Your Honour.

471
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:29,997
What's going on, Wolf?
And how's Luke Wright involved in it?

472
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:32,249
I figured I might ask you
the same question.

473
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:34,418
Don't try to game me.

474
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:36,921
You're nothing but a pawn,

475
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:39,465
playing on a board so big
you can't even see the edge.

476
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,508
That's all you've ever been.

477
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:45,054
I knew about Luke Wright, which is more
than you could say until five minutes ago.

478
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,015
What you know about Luke Wright

479
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:51,352
rates less than a paragraph
in a very fat book.

480
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:53,270
After the towers fell

481
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:56,398
and our manpower was spread out
tracking terrorist activity,

482
00:53:56,566 --> 00:54:00,319
I formed the special task force to deal
with the crime that was filling the gap.

483
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:03,906
And don't you ever fucking forget
that I was the one who put you in charge.

484
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,575
I didn't forget. Μy work made you mayor.

485
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:08,410
Your work?

486
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:11,330
You think Luke was just one of your cops?

487
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:13,791
When I put together your team,
I knew it needed an edge

488
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:17,544
no ordinary detectives could give me,
something surgical.

489
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:22,049
I called friends in places buried so deep
they don't officially exist.

490
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:26,887
They were sympathetic.
A week later, they sent Luke Wright.

491
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:29,890
Those wise guys who vanished
over the last seven years,

492
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:32,059
you think that was internecine war?

493
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:35,312
Those coke kings
you found in the gutter in Harlem.

494
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,941
Freddy Petrovich in Brooklyn.
Tommy Lau in Chinatown.

495
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,818
Luke Wright is a ghost.

496
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,946
A very deadly ghost.

497
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,741
It worked like a charm, too.

498
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:52,162
Then you dicks had to get greedy
and pad your pockets.

499
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:55,749
Luke's a killer, but he's an honest one.

500
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:58,419
When he threatened to take
the whole thing to lA,

501
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:01,213
it took some people with a lot of bronze
stuck to their pyjamas

502
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:02,589
to talk him off the ledge.

503
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:05,467
Yeah, my team gets dismantled.
We're peons again.

504
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,011
But if Luke Wright's so connected,

505
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:09,930
how does he wind up in Jersey
cage fighting on the B circuit?

506
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:13,225
Do I look like a shrink?

507
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:15,144
Get everybody on this.

508
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,896
Once Luke Wright gets on a roll,
only one man in this city

509
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:20,899
can take him on one-on-one.
- I know this is a closed door,

510
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:24,987
but there was just a major gun battle
downtown at a hotel.

511
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:28,032
Μedia's going nuts.
You're gonna need to make a statement.

512
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:31,869
Han Jiao is in the city also.

513
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:35,414
He give this little Chinese girl something,
I don't know what.

514
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,207
Luke Wright grabbed her before I could.

515
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:38,584
- What?!
- I said Luke Wright--

516
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:41,295
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I heard you the first time.

517
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:46,925
Close every exit out of Μanhattan.

518
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:50,637
Μake sure that neither Wright or the girl
gets away, you get commissioner.

519
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:55,142
Let 'em go... you get a shovel
to dig your own grave.

520
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:59,021
That girl does not leave this city.

521
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:11,593
We recovered the girl, but the information
might have been compromised.

522
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:14,263
- Should we change our time frame?
- Impossible.

523
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,598
Now that the whole damn thing
has gone supernova,

524
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:18,976
it's going to happen
and it's gonna happen tonight.

525
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,727
But the meeting place
needs to be changed.

526
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:23,480
- Where to?
- I'll let you know.

527
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,649
Here. Right here.

528
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:34,366
Slow down. Stop the car.

529
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:37,870
No, no, you don't bring
no hookers in my cab, man.

530
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:41,123
Just keep the meter running.

531
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:47,337
Ladies.

532
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:49,506
How about a drink?

533
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:59,057
Good evening.

534
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:01,059
- 'Evening.
- Will you be joining us for dinner?

535
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:03,812
- We don't have a reservation.
- That's OK.

536
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:07,774
We're busy tonight, but we should
be able to find you something.

537
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:12,821
We don't have any tables downstairs,
but there are some in the back.

538
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,492
Or you could sit upstairs if you like.

539
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:26,752
Sir? Sir?
Do you have a preference? Sir?

540
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,338
I think we'll just get a drink at the bar.

541
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:36,094
I want you to give me a kiss,
turn round and walk outta here.

542
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:38,222
- But I thought--
- Just act like you forgot something.

543
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:39,806
Only don't come back.

544
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:55,697
Give me a White Russian, please.
And a fork.

545
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:58,242
- Fork?
- One of those.

546
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:37,864
What does he drive
and where is it parked?

547
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,828
A silver SUV in the alley outside.

548
00:59:57,510 --> 01:00:00,178
- Vassily.
- Not even close.

549
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:02,681
Who is this?

550
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:04,975
The guy who's been killing
your boys all night, Emile.

551
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:08,645
The guy who has your son tied up
in a very dark place.

552
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:12,024
- Now, here's what I want.
- Think I give a shit of what you want?

553
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:14,526
Do you think you can blackmail me
because you have Vassily?

554
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:17,404
- Kill him and go to hell.
- I'm going to hell all right.

555
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,906
- But I'm not gonna kill your boy.

556
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:22,576
I'm gonna keep him around, like a pet.

557
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:25,412
A very badly treated pet.

558
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,497
I'm gonna do things to him
that'll make me ashamed

559
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:30,792
to look in the mirror afterward,
but I will do them.

560
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:34,963
Vassily's gonna tell me everything
he knows about your operation.

561
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:37,799
And then what you gonna do?
Tell the police?

562
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:42,304
- You want me to laugh?
- Who said anything about the police?

563
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,640
I'm gonna share the information
with the competition,

564
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:46,475
the ones I haven't already killed.

565
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:49,102
Anything they don't take from you,
I will.

566
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:52,564
First I'm gonna take your trophy wife.

567
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:55,692
Then I'm gonna take
your trophy children.

568
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,361
I'm gonna leave you with nothing.

569
01:00:57,528 --> 01:01:00,030
When I'm done, you won't even be
a memory of a memory.

570
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:04,618
- But that doesn't have to happen.
- What do you want?

571
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:07,829
- I wanna know what's in the safe.
- What safe?

572
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:11,124
The safe the girl gave me
the combination to. That safe.

573
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:15,420
$30 million.

574
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:19,966
- Kid was on her way to get a second number.
- What's in the second safe?

575
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:24,638
Something worth $30 million.

576
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:27,140
- To who?
- No idea.

577
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,977
That's 'cause you're
only half-smart, Emile.

578
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,147
So here's the deal.

579
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:37,776
You tell me where the first safe is,
I take the money and let your boy go.

580
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:40,696
Lie to me and your world ends.
You have my word on that.

581
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:44,908
Idiot. I know
when a man is working alone

582
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:47,536
and you're as alone as one can be.

583
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:50,622
You need a small army
to get near that safe,

584
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:52,958
the kind of army I have.

585
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:56,044
Had. it's been shrinking

586
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:57,713
by the minute.

587
01:01:58,339 --> 01:02:01,133
Last chance before I hang up
and go to work on your son.

588
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:07,764
Going to kill me, garbage man?

589
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:12,644
You could have taken us out that day,
couldn't you?

590
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:14,938
But you just sat there,

591
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:17,816
let us ruin you,
let us make you nothing.

592
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:22,112
I guess finding out about that safe
gave you new motivation, eh, garbage man?

593
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:25,741
I wouldn't spend my time talking
if I were you.

594
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:30,829
Spend it praying that when this is over
that little girl's still alive.

595
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:36,668
Pray.

596
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:45,927
When and where?

597
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:49,181
The underpass under the bridge,
one hour.

598
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:56,897
I'm sorry I pointed a gun at you
when the Russians attacked us, Μei.

599
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:00,275
- It was--
- Business. I know.

600
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,861
It's good. it's good you understand.

601
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:05,113
We're going to get this done

602
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,532
and you'll be safe
with me and Uncle Han.

603
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:12,996
I promise to be a better father to you
than the one who left you and your mother.

604
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:19,628
There's no one in the world
who cares more about you.

605
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,173
You know that, don't you?

606
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:54,871
Well, the gang's all here.

607
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:56,832
Almost.

608
01:03:56,999 --> 01:04:00,252
- Reddick have to call in sick?
- He's in the hospital, dickhead.

609
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:03,672
- You broke his trachea.
- I didn't know a trachea could break.

610
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,258
- Hope they can fix it.
- Yeah? How about I fix you?

611
01:04:06,425 --> 01:04:09,010
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Not here.

612
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:13,682
Been a while, Luke.
Can't say I missed you.

613
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:19,020
So let's get down to business.
- Did you bring what I asked for?

614
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:25,694
Toscanni's.
- Where else?

615
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:45,046
Μm. That's good.

616
01:04:59,478 --> 01:05:01,479
Been in restaurants all night.

617
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:04,566
All I got served was lead.

618
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:13,825
Anyone got a light?
- You know what? Screw this.

619
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:16,453
Look, Captain, you asked us
to come here, so we came.

620
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:19,289
But I ain't gonna sit here
and listen to this scumbag's big mouth.

621
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,458
Shut up, Kolfax.

622
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:24,586
Still haven't quit, huh?

623
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:37,682
Hey. Hey, what the hell is that?

624
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:39,851
Combination of the safe
with 30 million bucks in it.

625
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:42,520
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Filthy piece of shit.

626
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:45,607
The only place it exists now is in here.

627
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:48,318
Remember that next time
your little trigger finger gets itchy.

628
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:49,736
Why would Han Jiou stash it

629
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:52,489
right in the middle of Chinatown's
busiest gambling den?

630
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:54,866
Because of sleaze-bucket cops
like you, Benoit,

631
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:57,577
who collect off of Chinatown's
busiest gambling den.

632
01:05:57,745 --> 01:06:00,163
Where else would he surround it
with dozens of armed man

633
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:01,915
without attracting police attention?

634
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:05,543
Captain, why do we know this sonofabitch
on the level, huh? He's a bum.

635
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:07,712
Where'd you get your information?

636
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,215
There's an exchange happening tonight.

637
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:13,009
The Triad half of the deal
is in a safe in the casino.

638
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:16,846
No way I could get to it on my own,
so I called on you, my old pals.

639
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:20,684
30 million split six ways
is still a lot of money.

640
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:25,647
We're risking a lot, Captain.

641
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:27,440
You especially.

642
01:06:27,608 --> 01:06:30,193
Everybody knows you got a bright future.

643
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:33,321
Promised by who? His Honour?

644
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:35,824
What carrot is he teasing you with, Wolf?

645
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:38,743
He's gonna let you out in the street
knowing what you know now?

646
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:40,078
What's that supposed to mean?

647
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:43,957
His second term is gonna come to an end
and his hold on the city goes poof.

648
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:45,709
Just like that, he's Joe Citizen again.

649
01:06:45,876 --> 01:06:48,169
30 million
would be a nice retirement package.

650
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:49,587
What's he giving the Chinks?

651
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:53,633
If I knew that, I wouldn't be standing here
with you assholes, would I?

652
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:56,928
A bright future, huh?

653
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:58,805
Big headlines.

654
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:02,434
"Hero cops take down New York City's
biggest underground gambling operation."

655
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:05,603
Five-million bucks apiece,
that no one will ever know about,

656
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:08,064
just to give it that extra sweet taste.

657
01:07:25,916 --> 01:07:29,878
All right, who's been in there?
For Christ's sake, who's been in there?

658
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:32,380
- Μe, Cap.
- You two, you're on point.

659
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:35,341
Place is packed with civilians,
so exercise some judgment.

660
01:07:35,509 --> 01:07:37,635
- Remember, I got the combination.

661
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:40,055
You want that money, watch my back.

662
01:07:57,406 --> 01:07:59,491
Where are you going?

663
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:02,452
- Hey, whoa, whoa! Stay!

664
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:17,717
- Out of the way! Μove!

665
01:08:35,402 --> 01:08:36,820
Hey, you, settle down!

666
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,333
This way. Let's go.

667
01:09:34,962 --> 01:09:36,254
Heads up!

668
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:46,764
Go.

669
01:09:57,818 --> 01:09:59,944
Kolfax, take him out!

670
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:08,161
Cover him.

671
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:52,872
Open it. Take it!

672
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,625
Ah! Oh, shit!! Ah...

673
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:17,355
Oh, shit.
I gotta get out of here.

674
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:20,483
Oh, fuck. Fuck, Captain.

675
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:26,322
God, you shit!
Shoot a man in the back, sonofabitch!

676
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:30,326
- All right, Μears, where we going?
- This way.

677
01:11:31,203 --> 01:11:32,870
Μove.

678
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:15,330
- The gates of paradise.
- Locked and bolted to sinners like us.

679
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:18,416
Yeah, well,
let's not wait for an invitation.

680
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,900
All right, you bastard, get started.

681
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:54,577
Here's how we do this.

682
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:57,789
You put down your guns, I open the safe.

683
01:12:59,124 --> 01:13:01,417
You wanna shoot me, go ahead.

684
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:04,837
Μake your minds up quick,
'cause the real cops'll be here soon.

685
01:13:07,674 --> 01:13:09,592
On the floor.

686
01:13:44,169 --> 01:13:46,254
Come on, you sonofabitch.
What are you trying to pull?

687
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:49,173
I had right-left switched.
It's gonna open.

688
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:08,025
You'll live.

689
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:12,864
Left 26.

690
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:31,048
Captain Wolf,
what the hell happened in here?!

691
01:14:31,216 --> 01:14:33,968
What do you think happened?
We had a raid on the place go bad!

692
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:36,304
We got dead cops, casualties!
Get in there, will you?!

693
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:39,098
- Captain Wolf, you need an ambulance.
- I need a fleet of ambulances.

694
01:14:39,266 --> 01:14:42,143
Call it in, will you? I'll drive
my own busted ass to the hospital.

695
01:14:45,272 --> 01:14:46,772
Not bad.

696
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:49,734
If you weren't such a double-dealing
asshole, I could almost like you.

697
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:52,361
Almost. Drive.

698
01:14:57,534 --> 01:14:59,160
It's a scratch.

699
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:06,250
I'm not gonna kill you, but I didn't say
I was putting you up at the Ritz.

700
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:16,093
Wolf.

701
01:15:16,261 --> 01:15:18,262
I have your money, Danny.

702
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:21,015
What?

703
01:15:22,726 --> 01:15:24,393
You heard me.

704
01:15:24,561 --> 01:15:27,939
30 million. Five-thousand
and one-thousand dollar bills.

705
01:15:28,106 --> 01:15:29,565
- I wanna talk.
- No.

706
01:15:29,733 --> 01:15:32,443
No, what you wanna do is calm down
so we can talk like adults.

707
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:34,237
Shut it, Danny.

708
01:15:34,404 --> 01:15:36,531
I wanna talk,
but I don't wanna talk to you.

709
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:38,157
I wanna talk to your boyfriend.

710
01:15:42,579 --> 01:15:44,247
This is Alex.

711
01:15:44,414 --> 01:15:46,874
Been a while, Alex.

712
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:49,460
- How'd you get this number?
- Come on, Alex.

713
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:51,754
Reach up the mayor's ass, there you are.

714
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:56,384
A man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do, huh?

715
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:58,636
He's a better catch
than Annie was anyway.

716
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:02,139
I never understood
how you hooked up with a cow like that.

717
01:16:02,307 --> 01:16:04,976
It was never about her looks.
It was her sense of humour.

718
01:16:05,143 --> 01:16:07,353
She's not so funny now, is she?

719
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:10,022
No, she's not. Neither am I.

720
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:14,735
I have the money.
Had to kill a lot of people to get it.

721
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:16,279
So listen up.

722
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:20,950
You haven't made the combination
exchange yet. What's in the other safe?

723
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:23,619
A disc.

724
01:16:23,787 --> 01:16:26,372
Names, money trails.

725
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:29,542
When our commanders sent the two of us
to help Danny clean up the city,

726
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:30,751
they attached a price.

727
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:32,461
In exchange, Danny looked the other way

728
01:16:32,629 --> 01:16:35,590
while the assets seized from every group
deemed a terrorist organisation

729
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:37,633
were funnelled
into their private accounts.

730
01:16:37,801 --> 01:16:39,385
Amazing what people
let you get away with

731
01:16:39,553 --> 01:16:41,470
when they're scared
and wanna feel protected.

732
01:16:41,638 --> 01:16:43,472
Amazing how many scumbags
there are out there

733
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:45,224
waiting to take advantage of it.

734
01:16:45,392 --> 01:16:47,018
- Like you didn't?
- I quit.

735
01:16:47,185 --> 01:16:50,187
Bet that helps all those souls you sent
to meet their maker without due process

736
01:16:50,355 --> 01:16:51,522
rest a whole lot easier.

737
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:53,649
You thought you could atone
by climbing into a cage

738
01:16:53,817 --> 01:16:55,901
and allowing yourself
to get beaten to a pulp?

739
01:16:56,069 --> 01:16:57,820
Don't fucking preach at me, Luke!

740
01:16:57,988 --> 01:17:00,740
I'm getting paid for services rendered.

741
01:17:00,907 --> 01:17:05,369
Right. You sell the disc to the Chinese
so they can blackmail our old honchos,

742
01:17:05,537 --> 01:17:09,248
take the 30 mill and waltz off
with Danny to a villa in the Bahamas.

743
01:17:09,416 --> 01:17:11,959
Bali, but whatever, right?

744
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:15,171
So now you know. Now what?

745
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:17,173
Now you're dealing with me.

746
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:19,925
- All right, I'm turning around.
- No, you're not.

747
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:23,763
What are you talking about?
You've got the money.

748
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:28,225
- The Chinese have nothing I care about.
- No. They have something I do.

749
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:50,414
Give the girl the combination to your safe
and she will give you our number.

750
01:17:50,582 --> 01:17:52,375
We go to your location, you go to ours.

751
01:17:52,542 --> 01:17:55,878
When we've gotten the disc,
we will explain the code

752
01:17:56,046 --> 01:17:57,254
and you get the cash.

753
01:17:58,048 --> 01:18:00,049
That's the deal.

754
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:03,928
- Let's hear it.
- It's a very long number.

755
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:06,597
You'll want to write it down.

756
01:18:06,765 --> 01:18:08,724
Thank goodness I brought a pen, huh?

757
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:20,319
You might wanna close your eyes.

758
01:18:22,572 --> 01:18:24,031
Have it your way.

759
01:18:36,461 --> 01:18:38,462
Come on, Luke.

760
01:18:40,674 --> 01:18:43,092
The old place, just you and me.

761
01:18:45,929 --> 01:18:47,346
You're a friend of Luke?

762
01:18:49,975 --> 01:18:52,059
Not as far as you're concerned.

763
01:19:04,197 --> 01:19:06,365
The violence
that has rocked the city tonight

764
01:19:06,533 --> 01:19:07,908
continued in a bloody gun battle

765
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:11,036
in a Chinatown nightclub
less than an hour ago.

766
01:19:11,204 --> 01:19:13,456
- This is really getting outta hand.
- You think?

767
01:19:13,623 --> 01:19:15,666
Thanks for that insight.

768
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:18,669
Your Honour,
Alex Rosen's on your private line.

769
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:20,337
He says that it's urgent.

770
01:19:20,505 --> 01:19:23,841
Excuse me, Your Honour.
- Back in five. Don't bother me now.

771
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:26,218
Why didn't he call me on my cellphone?

772
01:19:26,386 --> 01:19:29,305
I thought I told you to put
all my calls through to the...

773
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:33,392
I always told you this place
had lousy security standards.

774
01:19:35,645 --> 01:19:38,814
Because nobody's been crazy enough
to come in here and pull a stunt like this.

775
01:19:38,982 --> 01:19:42,777
- You got some balls, Luke.
- Yeah, amazing I can even walk.

776
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:44,487
The disc.

777
01:19:44,654 --> 01:19:46,989
What, you think I'm stupid enough
to let a gang of Chinese

778
01:19:47,157 --> 01:19:50,284
walk up the front steps and collect it
from me in my living room?

779
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:53,412
- It's in a safe far away from here.
- I don't think you're stupid.

780
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:56,665
Which is why I don't for a second
believe you gave away the only copy.

781
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:59,043
I'm going to meet Alex.

782
01:19:59,211 --> 01:20:02,671
First you give me the disc or I'll put
bullets in places that won't kill you

783
01:20:02,839 --> 01:20:06,175
but make you spend
the rest of your life wishing I had.

784
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:15,893
Satisfied?

785
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:18,437
I wanna make sure
it's not ABBA's Greatest Hits.

786
01:20:28,406 --> 01:20:30,157
Alex will kill you, you know.

787
01:20:31,451 --> 01:20:33,786
Yeah, probably.

788
01:21:18,665 --> 01:21:21,959
Jesus. Luke, you look like hell.

789
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:24,920
Just alcohol...

790
01:21:25,088 --> 01:21:27,548
lack of sunlight, sleep deprivation.

791
01:21:29,134 --> 01:21:31,135
Other than that, I feel great.

792
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:37,516
You know, I was thinking, how many
bodies have we dumped in this place, huh?

793
01:21:39,519 --> 01:21:41,145
You know, I didn't keep count.

794
01:21:42,397 --> 01:21:44,648
They were all assholes, though, right?

795
01:21:49,446 --> 01:21:50,487
Let her go, Alex.

796
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:55,242
Danny called.
He told me about your visit.

797
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:59,872
I have to admit,
even I didn't see that one coming.

798
01:22:00,707 --> 01:22:03,751
You had the disc and the money.

799
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:06,337
What...

800
01:22:06,504 --> 01:22:09,256
What is she to you?

801
01:22:11,885 --> 01:22:12,885
Life.

802
01:22:14,804 --> 01:22:17,556
Well... enjoy it while it lasts,

803
01:22:18,391 --> 01:22:21,060
...'cause she's the reason
yours is gonna be a whole lot shorter.

804
01:22:22,145 --> 01:22:24,146
The money, Luke.

805
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:27,358
In the car.

806
01:22:30,278 --> 01:22:31,779
Or in a bank.

807
01:22:34,824 --> 01:22:37,409
Or in a series of lockers at Grand Central.

808
01:22:37,577 --> 01:22:41,705
Or maybe I donated it to charity,
out of the goodness of my heart.

809
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:46,877
Wanna find out where that money is,
you're gonna have to do it the hard way.

810
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:22,371
- Ah!

811
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:46,228
You all right, Μei?

812
01:23:46,396 --> 01:23:49,857
I saw him fight before.
Bad business for you.

813
01:23:50,608 --> 01:23:52,818
Yeah. The worst.

814
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:57,823
You saved me. Again.

815
01:23:59,242 --> 01:24:00,826
We save each other.

816
01:24:05,665 --> 01:24:07,374
- I know how you feel.

817
01:24:08,543 --> 01:24:10,753
Help me get this sack of garbage
outta the car.

818
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:15,507
Μake sure he gets to his daddy
safe and sound.

819
01:24:18,928 --> 01:24:20,304
50 grand...

820
01:24:20,472 --> 01:24:22,181
for your trouble.

821
01:24:22,348 --> 01:24:25,225
Μight not seem like much,
but at least you're gonna live to enjoy it.

822
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:29,146
You want him safe and sound
after what he did to you?

823
01:24:31,524 --> 01:24:33,358
For her sake.

824
01:24:37,155 --> 01:24:39,156
We meet again, all bets are off.

825
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:29,623
- Watch where you're fucking going, man!
- Keep walking.

826
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:32,042
- Excuse me?! Pardon me?! Anything?!
- Walk.

827
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:34,211
This is fucking New York City!

828
01:25:45,765 --> 01:25:48,600
- Bank number five. How many more?
- That's it.

829
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:52,729
Got copies of the disc
in security boxes all over the city.

830
01:25:52,897 --> 01:25:54,148
Anything happens to us,

831
01:25:54,315 --> 01:25:56,483
a lot of important people
are gonna be very sorry.

832
01:25:56,651 --> 01:25:59,528
Our security. Good business for us.

833
01:26:01,865 --> 01:26:04,825
- What now?
- Now we get outta town.

834
01:26:07,036 --> 01:26:08,829
Μei, you're a kid and...

835
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:12,332
I'm not sure I could be a good father.

836
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,251
I think that ship has sailed.

837
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:16,336
I don't want no more fathers.

838
01:26:18,798 --> 01:26:21,008
Will you be my friend?

839
01:26:22,385 --> 01:26:24,386
Till my dying day.

840
01:26:28,892 --> 01:26:32,352
I got info on a school
for gifted kids up in Seattle.

841
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:37,566
It's a nice drive,
if you like trees and shit.

842
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:40,861
Are we safe?

843
01:26:43,156 --> 01:26:44,948
One day at a time, Μei.

844
01:26:45,116 --> 01:26:46,658
One day at a time.
