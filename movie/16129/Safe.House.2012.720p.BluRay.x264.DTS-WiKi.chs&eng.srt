Well, you locked me in the trunk.

419
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,230
你不是卧底  用的是真名
Come on, you're not NOC. You're here under your real name.

420
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,280
叫什么
What is it?

421
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,490
马特・韦斯顿
Weston, Matt.

422
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:08,200
好的
All right.

423
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,070
你当安全屋看守多久了
How long you been a safe house keeper?

424
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,120
12个月
Twelve months.

425
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,370
周年快乐啊
Happy birthday.

426
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,000
开普敦不算什么机密
Cape Town, that's low-level detail.

427
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,750
你现在应该自由了
You should have been out of here by now.

428
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,920
也许我有新任务了呢
Maybe I requested the assignment.

429
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:26,590
也许情报局不再信任你了
Or maybe Langley doesn't trust you with anything else.

430
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,140
你有什么计划
So, what's your plan?

431
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,220
让我来猜猜  你打算根据法则行事
Oh, let me guess. Follow protocol.

432
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:36,480
根据法则如果你的安全屋暴露了
Protocol states that if your house is crashed,

433
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,350
先用反追踪技能确保无人跟踪
you do an SDR to make sure no one's following you.

434
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:43,650
使用应急包里的定位系统  选择一个新安全屋
Activate your GPS in your Go-Bag, select another safe house.

435
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,740
你以为我会让你把我关起来吗
You think I'm going to let you just take me in?

436
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,320
你给我闭嘴
I think you need to shut up.

437
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:51,530
你应该先想想
I think you need to consider

438
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,200
为什么你的安全屋会被攻击
how your house was attacked in the first place.

439
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,290
你考虑过吗  马特
Have you done that, Matt?

440
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,830
他们跟踪季福尔  从领事馆一直跟过来
They followed Kiefer. They followed him from the consulate,

441
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,000
然后找到了安全屋
and that's how they found the safe house.

442
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,710
得了吧  你不会真这么想吧
Come on, you don't really believe that, do you?

443
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,300
他们怎么事先料到我会在领事馆附近
How did they know l was near the consulate in the first place?

444
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:14,050
我喜欢这样  我们俩一起思考问题
But l like this, you know. You and me, figuring shit out.

445
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:17,060
就像硬汉兄弟一样
Like the Hardy Boys.

446
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,190
那间安全屋很隐秘
That house was a secure location.

447
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,600
那些追杀者
Whoever crashed it

448
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:24,210
肯定不会停在加油站
didn't stop by a gas station

449
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:26,860
问出最近的安全屋在哪
and ask for directions to the nearest safe house.

450
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,240
他们是被招引过来的  有人告密了  马特
They were invited. Someone told them, Matthew.

451
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,570
仔细想想  你认识的人
Think about it. Someone you know.

452
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,410
你得好好问自己  你能信任自己的上司吗
So you better ask yourself, can you trust your landlord?

453
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,290
算了吧  我不会听你挑拨的
Go ahead, you're not going to get in my head.

454
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:38,830
你已经开始怀疑了
I already am in your head.

455
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,540
他们在孤立你  马特
They're going to isolate you, Matt.

456
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,920
一开始他们会对你很好
They're going to be real nice to you at first.

457
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,070
胳膊搭在你肩膀上
They're going to put their

458
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,710
一边这么跟你说
arm around you and tell you things like,

459
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:47,800
"你干得不错  下面我们接手"
"You did a decent job, son. We'll take it from here."

460
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,300
那时候你就知道自己完蛋了
That's when you know you're screwed.

461
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,380
别考虑我  他们的目标是你
Forget about me. They're going to focus on you.

462
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,680
他们会试图让你我之间有关联
They're going to try and make a connection between you and I.

463
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,720
这样如果计划失败
So that if this all goes wrong,

464
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,390
在最后参议院听证会时
they'll have something to fall back on

465
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,850
他们就有垫背了
in their little Senate hearings.

466
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:06,690
今晚我不是你唯一的敌人
I'm not your only enemy tonight.

467
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,740
有内鬼
So, it's someone in-house.

468
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,990
只可能是这样
It's the only way this thing could've happened.

469
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,700
我们完全被蒙蔽了
We were completely buttoned up.

470
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,910
给我所有知道行动的人的名单
I want a list of everyone who knew about this.

471
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,500
背景  从属关系
Backgrounds, affiliations,

472
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,210
尤其是任何与福斯特的联系
particularly any connections with Frost.

473
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:25,830
这次计划前的每一次行动
Every movement right up until this operation.

474
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,550
你的审问队  组队多久了
Your extraction team, how long had they been together?

475
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:32,470
组队6个月  怎么了
My team had been together six months. Why?

476
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,430
我只是想把事情搞清楚
Well, I'm just trying to get my head around this.

477
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:37,970
你们可以走了  谢谢
That will do, thank you.

478
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:00,870
-情报呢  -情报丢失

479
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:10,330
-可以找回吗  -可以

480
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,580
没有情报就没有报酬

481
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:20,060
明白

482
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:28,960
斯坦德酒店  巴罗  开普敦西侧

483
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:27,710
-喂  -是我
- Hello. - Hey.

484
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,830
宝贝  你在哪
Baby, where are you?

485
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,790
我很好  我没事
I'm all right. I'm okay.

486
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,920
我没事
I'm okay.

487
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,430
对不起没回你电话  我看到未接来电了
I'm sorry I didn't call you back, I saw your missed calls.

488
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:40,180
你肯定担心死了
You must be worried sick.

489
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,510
都顺利吗
Is everything okay?

490
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:45,310
我很好  听着
I'm good. I'm good. Listen.

491
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:47,020
这听起来很疯狂
This sounds so crazy.

492
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:49,520
昨晚诊所被袭击了
We had some threats against the clinic last night,

493
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,770
所以帕克和我
so Parker and I, we stayed all night

494
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:53,070
整晚都在弄清怎么回事
trying to get to the bottom of it.

495
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,800
对不起没有回你电话
And I'm sorry that I didn't call you back.

496
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,030
我应该立刻回复的
I should have, right away.

497
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:58,650
我真的好担心
I was so worried.

498
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,240
我知道
I know.

499
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:04,020
能帮我个忙吗
Can you do me a favor?

500
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,120
你能到窗户那去一下吗
Can you go over to the window for a second?

501
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,330
怎么了
why?

502
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,830
你能瞄一眼外面吗
Can you just take a quick look out the window?

503
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,960
我想让你看看有没有人
I want you to see if there's anyone out there.

504
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,130
有没有陌生的车
Are there any cars that don't belong?

505
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:16,000
有没有徘徊不走的人
Anyone hanging around out front?

506
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:19,380
有辆警车
There's a police car.

507
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:22,590
发生什么事了
What's going on?

508
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,680
真的对不起
I'm sorry about this.

509
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,970
我知道这很过分
I know this is a lot,

510
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,640
但是为了以防万一
but we felt like it would be best

511
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,270
我们最好不要回家
if we didn't go home as a precaution,

512
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:29,310
我也这么觉得
and I agree with him.

513
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:31,100
虽然没什么好担心的  但是这样最好
I know there's nothing to worry about, but I agree with him.

514
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:33,480
你该去黛娜家避一避
I think you should just go to Dena's for a little while,

515
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,400
就几个小时  我一会儿打给你
just for a few hours, and I'll call you in a little bit.

516
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:39,860
然后我们碰面  好吗
And we'll get together, okay?

517
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:48,950
好  我会去的
Okay, I'll go.

518
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:55,630
我爱你  待会儿打给你  好吗
Okay. I love you. I'll talk to you soon, all right?

519
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:58,050
别担心  再见
Don't worry. Okay, bye.

520
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,710
星期五
下午5:23

521
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,160
她知道你是做什么的吗
She know what you do for a living?

522
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,660
电话里那个女孩  是女的吧
The girl on the phone. It was a girl, wasn't it?

523
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,840
也许是男的  我不知道
Maybe it was a guy, I don't know.

524
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,130
我不做评论
I don't judge.

525
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:44,840
你得知道
You can't expect to have a

526
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,180
做我们这行的不能动心  马特
real relationship in our line of work, Matthew.

527
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:51,100
别担心  她不会离开你的
Don't worry. She's not going to leave you.

528
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:55,020
但是  你试图用谎言保护她
See, what happens is, you try to protect her with lies,

529
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,690
最后越来越多
and then it starts to add up.

530
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,030
在安全屋你说他们会为了抓你而杀了我
At the safe house you said that they'd kill me to get to you.

531
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:02,570
等过段时间  就连真相
After a while, even the truth. . .

532
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:04,910
-怎么了  -听起来也像谎言
- Why?...- Starts to sound like a lie.

533
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,370
你有件东西  他们想要的  是什么
You have something. You got something that they want. What is it?

534
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:09,450
她是本地人吗
Is she a local?

535
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,540
别管她  是什么
Don't worry about her. What is it?

536
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:12,120
是女孩儿啊
Oh, it is a girl.

537
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:28,550
你会一直说谎  而她会一直相信你
You'll keep covering your tracks, she'll keep believing.

538
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,770
因为她想相信  她需要相信
Because she wants to, because she needs to.

539
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:36,980
这就是我们存在的理由  你和我  我们的工作
That's why we exist, you and me, that's our job.

540
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,650
利用别人这一点
To take advantage of that.

541
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:43,820
人们渴望相信
People's desire to believe.

542
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:45,740
渴望信任
To trust.

543
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,750
她不会离开你的  马特
She's not going to leave you, Matthew.

544
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:02,460
你会离开她
You're going to leave her.

545
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:10,600
我不是你
I'm not you.

546
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,360
没错  长官  已经确认了
Correct, sir. We verified it.

547
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,850
那是你的人  你处理
That is your boy. You take it.

548
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:57,100
所有人准备
Everybody, stand by.

549
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,770
马特  是我
Matty, it's me.

550
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:02,150
你怎么样
How are you holding up?

551
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:04,570
我还好
I'm all right.

552
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:12,870
马特  支援至少要等12小时
Matt, we can't get another team in for at least 12 hours.

553
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:15,370
抱歉
Sorry.

554
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:19,330
我们在城外帮你准备了另一个安全屋
We've cleared a new safe house for you outside the city.

Sabotage, counter-ambush, counter-IED tactics,

638
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:25,230
直到他4年前在里斯本搞砸了一项行动
until he blew up an op in Lisbon four years ago

639
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:26,770
后被转职做文件工作

640
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:29,110
开普敦警方发现他头部中枪

用的是强力来复枪  距领事馆14个街区

官方他们什么都没说
Officially, they're saying nothing.

649
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,090
非官方呢
Unofficially?

650

他们认为他在出售情报

652
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:57,470
那么韦德卖了什么重要情报给福斯特
So what the hell did Wade leak to Frost

653
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:00,720
竟然害死我们6个人

向军情六处了解详情  联系所有渠道
I want more details from MI6. Call in every chit you got.

他可能去哪

665
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:15,630
不清楚  但我会尽力找
Not exactly, but I will.

666
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:18,050
我是林克雷特  你说他杀了两个警察
This is Linklater. You said he took out two cops?

667
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:19,840
马特  接到免提上了

00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:29,770
据描述  嫌疑人为中等身材白人

671
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:32,150
体育馆警方说你杀了一个警察

672
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:34,320
我开枪是为了自卫
I returned fire in self-defense.

673
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:37,320
重点是  福斯特跑了
The fact of the matter is, Frost is on the loose.

674
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:39,400
我前面14个小时都和他在一起
I've spent the last 14 hours with him.

675
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:41,820
他说的或者做的可能帮我找到他
He might have said or done something that could lead me to him.

676
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:45,580
你撤退  前往领事馆
You are to stand down, proceed to the consulate,

677
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:47,950
表明自己是撤退来汇报情况的  请确认
and present yourself for exfil and debrief. Acknowledge.

00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,460
等我汇报完情况  福斯特就找不到了
By the time I'm debriefed, Frost will be gone.

679
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:52,040
我花了12个月了解
I've spent 12 months researching

680

这城市每一寸土地

681
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:56,090
我会找到福斯特把他送来的

682
00:59:56,170 --> 00:59:58,590
韦斯顿  我是哈伦・魏特福

686
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,790
长官  我提议
Sir, I respectfully request that,

687
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,210
这次交接不要写入他的档案
that exchange not make it onto his files.

688
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:39,760
他要么是无能  要么就是跟人合谋
He's either incompetent or he's working with somebody else.

689
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,340
别这么说韦斯顿
Do not make this about Weston.

690
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:42,880
你的人丢了福斯特

691
01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:44,640
你的队伍毁了安全屋

692

你们俩飞去开普敦

828
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:06,670

831
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:15,740
还算过得去
it's passable.

832
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:17,910
很好  我一出城
It's good. I'll wire you the money

833
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,410
就把钱邮给你
as soon as I get out of town.

834
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:24,080
托宾  别这样  这不一样
Tobin, don't do this. It's different.

抱歉听到这个

你这里的绷带松开了

887
01:22:55,550 --> 01:22:58,220
别杀无辜的人  马特
Don't kill innocent people, Matthew.

888
01:23:00,930 --> 01:23:02,140
什么
What?

889
01:23:07,770 --> 01:23:09,400
有个空中交管员
Air traffic controller,

890
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:12,650
管理百慕大群岛的一个小跑道

组织说他在运送武器
My inside officer said he was organizing arms shipments,

894
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:26,440
但他只是个空中交管员

895
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:27,960
老百姓一名
He was just a guy.

896
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:30,710
我朝他的头开了一枪
I put a bullet in his skull.

897
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,240
之后特警们插手
Black Ops came in,

898
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:37,130
其中一人接替了他
they replaced him with one of their own,

899
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:39,510
结果有艘飞机在那晚由于湾流坠入海底
and crashed a Gulfstream in the ocean that night.

900
01:23:39,590 --> 01:23:43,300
事实是  在飞机上的那家人

901
01:23:44,430 --> 01:23:47,810
那个丈夫  是个告密者

阻止他向国会听证会
stopping him from testifying about wet work

904
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:58,570
告发这次谋杀行动
to a congressional hearing.

905
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:03,410
那就是你离开的原因
Is that why you left?

906
01:24:03,490 --> 01:24:04,660
不
No.

907

我第二天
I went back to work the next day

908
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:10,420
就像什么都没发生一样回去工作

909
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:16,550
熟能生巧
You practice anything a long time, you get good at it.

910
01:24:16,630 --> 01:24:20,220
谎说得多了  就像真的一样
You tell a hundred lies a day, it sounds like the truth.

911
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:22,640
人们彼此背叛
Everyone betrays everyone.

912
01:24:25,390 --> 01:24:27,720
那是个糟糕的借口
That's a shitty excuse.

913
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:32,440
是的  我曾经像你一样天真
Yeah, I used to be innocent like you.

914
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:35,310
为国效力
Wrap myself up in the flag...

915
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:44,660
我要带你过去
I'm going to take you in.

916

好样的
Good for you.

921
01:25:56,270 --> 01:25:57,480
所以  他成功了 
So, he pulled it off.

922
01:25:57,560 --> 01:26:00,440
韦斯顿协助并教唆逃犯
Weston is aiding and abetting a fugitive.

923
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:01,940
你错了
You're wrong.

924
01:26:02,030 --> 01:26:03,380
如果他跟福斯特在一起
If he's with Frost,

925
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:04,610
一定正带他去安全屋
he's taking him to the safe house.

926
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:06,490
我们该去那儿
That's where we got to be.

927
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:08,530
好吧  好吧

谢谢  克莱顿  再见

962

它是微芯片

963

964
01:28:51,450 --> 01:28:52,860
我中情六处的伙计说的

只有韦德知道
Only Wade knew,

968
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:58,490
这样他跟福斯特碰头的原因
but I think it's safe to assume

969
01:28:58,580 --> 01:28:59,660
就说得通了
that's why he hooked up with Frost.

970

漫长的一天  是吧

我只能想象  托宾・福斯特

他可能有什么
Anything he might have had?

1023

要是有人监视你的
What would you do

1030
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:02,370
一举一动的话你会怎么做
if someone is watching your every move?

1031
01:38:03,670 --> 01:38:06,420
不那么光彩的事
Some maybe you're not proud of.

1032
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:09,960
你也会有不光彩的事的  相信我
And you will have some you're not proud of, believe me.

1033
01:38:10,050 --> 01:38:12,590
然后试图用它来对付你

1034
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:17,570
你就逼不得已了
You would do what you have to do.

1035

你就逼不得已了

是啊  死了很久了

福斯特在这儿

1041

我们走
Let's go.

1042

我们抓住他了
We got him.

1043
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:20,490
干得漂亮
A hell of a job.

1044
01:41:55,980 --> 01:41:57,360
你闻到没

当地的葡萄  品乐塔吉太棒了
Local grape. Pinotage is great...

1047
01:42:04,740 --> 01:42:05,740
品乐塔吉  是南非自己培育的  最有名的酿酒葡萄品种

1048
01:42:12,410 --> 01:42:14,830
我不想你把这个弄丢
I don't want you losing this one.

1049
01:42:15,370 --> 01:42:18,290
它值很多钱
It's worth a lot of money.

1050
01:42:21,590 --> 01:42:24,050
你是个好孩子  马特
You're a good boy, Matty.

1051
01:42:26,430 --> 01:42:28,090
你知道你是什么人
You know what you are.

1052
01:42:33,810 --> 01:42:35,730
我知道你不是什么人
I know what you're not.

1053
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:42,070
你比我好
You're better than me.

1054
01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:50,620
不  没事  比我好就可以了

1055
01:42:55,330 --> 01:42:57,080
跟我保证
You promise me.

1056
01:42:58,500 --> 01:42:59,750
好
Yeah.

1057
01:43:05,380 --> 01:43:07,680
我们  我们
Well, let's... let's

1058
01:43:10,010 --> 01:43:11,720
我们走
Let's go.

1059
01:43:13,100 --> 01:43:16,600
我只是得起来  我要起来
I just got to get up. I need to get up.

1060
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:20,860
别动
Stay.

1061
01:44:26,850 --> 01:44:29,940
维吉尼亚州兰利  中情局总部

1062
01:44:44,610 --> 01:44:48,110
一切据实所述
That's exactly as it happened.

1063
01:44:52,780 --> 01:44:54,490
显然  这种情况需要
Obviously, this situation needs

1064
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:56,830
用一些特殊手段来处理
to be handled with a certain amount of finesse.

1065
01:44:57,330 --> 01:44:58,950
还有其他人看过这份报告吗
Has anybody else seen this report?

1066
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:00,960
没有  长官  还没
No, sir. Not yet.

1067
01:45:02,290 --> 01:45:03,920
马特  我确定这些都真实无疑
Matt, I'm sure this comes as no surprise,

1068
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,660
但是这个报告的一些部分
but parts of this report are

1069
01:45:05,660 --> 01:45:08,630
将会威胁到国家安全
going to have to be altered for national security.

1070
01:45:09,970 --> 01:45:11,380
哪些部分  长官
Which parts, sir?

1071
01:45:11,470 --> 01:45:15,510
大卫・巴洛不能为
Well... David Barlow can't be held responsible

1072
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:17,470
安全屋事件负责
for what happened to the safe house.

1073
01:45:18,310 --> 01:45:20,890
我们不需要这个丑闻
We just don't need the scandal.

1074
01:45:20,980 --> 01:45:22,600
但是  长官  我们都知道
But, sir, you and I both know that,

1075
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:23,480
那不是事实
that is just not the truth.

1076
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:26,150
人们不再需要事实了  马特
People don't want the truth anymore, Matt.

1077
01:45:26,230 --> 01:45:29,110
它太麻烦了  把它们永远埋葬吧
It's too messy. Keeps them up nights.

1078
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:35,660
但我会告诉你我准备做什么
I'll tell you what I am willing to do, though.

1079
01:45:36,490 --> 01:45:39,580
我觉得局里太低估你了
I think the Agency has grossly underestimated you,

1080
01:45:39,660 --> 01:45:41,360
我推荐给你一个
and I'm recommending you

1081
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:43,790
更高的情报官员的职位
for a senior case officer position.

1082
01:45:43,870 --> 01:45:45,380
请表示你还想要它
Provided you still want it.

1083
01:45:46,290 --> 01:45:48,920
这是个慷慨的给予  长官
That's a generous offer, sir.

1084
01:45:50,050 --> 01:45:53,760
你只需为我澄清一件事
There's just one thing you need to clarify for me.

1085
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:55,140
当然
Of course.

1086
01:45:56,220 --> 01:45:59,220
福斯特曾带着一些重要的情报
Frost may have been carrying some vital intel.

1087
01:45:59,310 --> 01:46:00,640
一份文件
A file.

1088
01:46:01,230 --> 01:46:04,100
我没在这报告的任何地方看到它
I'm not seeing that anywhere in this report.

1089
01:46:11,530 --> 01:46:13,320
文件里有什么  长官
What was on the file, sir?

1090
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:16,110
坦白说  一些对局里和我们的盟友
Something that, quite frankly, could be very damaging

1091
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:18,530
很有毁灭性的东西
to the Agency and to our allies.

1092
01:46:21,700 --> 01:46:23,020
我不明白为什么
I don't see why Frost

1093
01:46:23,020 --> 01:46:25,830
福斯特会跟我说那样的事
would even mention something like that to me.

1094
01:46:31,090 --> 01:46:33,510
对  我觉得他不会  是吗
No, I suppose he wouldn't, would he?

1095
01:46:37,890 --> 01:46:41,140
但是你知道  如果那份文件泄露出去
You realize, though, that if that file did leak,

1096
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:44,810
相关人员会怎样吗
what would happen to the person responsible?

1097
01:46:44,890 --> 01:46:46,900
那些人会被逮捕  长官
That person would be arrested, sir.

1098
01:46:46,980 --> 01:46:48,810
他赌上了全部
He'd be risking everything.

1099
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:51,590
他会在全世界
He'd have enemies

1100
01:46:51,590 --> 01:46:53,650
所有情报局树敌
in every intelligence agency in the world.

1101
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:56,170
对中情局来说
In the eyes of the CIA,

1102
01:46:56,170 --> 01:46:58,820
他会跟托宾・福斯特一样
he'd be just like Tobin Frost.

1103
01:47:02,660 --> 01:47:04,040
福斯特没说任何
Frost didn't say anything

1104
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:05,580
关于文件的事  长官
about a file, sir.

1105
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:12,170
好吧  孩子
All right, son.

1106
01:47:13,300 --> 01:47:14,880
休息几天
Take a few days off.

1107
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:16,930
下周让你开始工作
We'll get you started next week.

1108
01:47:18,760 --> 01:47:20,100
谢谢你
Thank you.

1109
01:47:22,310 --> 01:47:25,270
想想我们的谈话  好吗
And think about our conversation, would you?

1110
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:27,020
我会的
Will do.

1111
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:29,060
剩下的我来处理  长官
I'll take it from here, sir.

1112
01:47:34,380 --> 01:47:36,950
美国中央情报局

其他媒体透露

1115
01:47:56,010 --> 01:47:58,840
他们从未知源接收到有争议性的文件

1116
01:47:59,050 --> 01:48:00,800
国际情报组织仍在为
The international intelligence community is still reeling

美国有线电视新闻网  新闻直播间  情报局泄露事件

1118
01:48:00,890 --> 01:48:03,890
如此高机密情报的泄露
from the release of so many highly classified documents

1119
01:48:03,970 --> 01:48:05,160
以及中情局 德国联邦情报局

和军情六处的普遍的腐败和犯罪活动

1121
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:08,560
感到震惊不已
at the CIA, the BND, and MI6.

英国有线新闻  国会控告军情六处官员
