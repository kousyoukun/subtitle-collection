Sorry we have done so much mess.

36
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,925
The kid is still learning.

37
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:14,110
And I'm not doctor, but I
I was eating for two.

38
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,107
Charlie Manson Family.

39
00:07:16,299 --> 00:07:19,639
My father wanted to call another, but I decide
mine.

40
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:25,130
You're wrong to kill someone
you cannot defend.

41
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:29,853
Who is it? You?
Well, why not?

42
00:07:30,276 --> 00:07:34,960
Just killed your wife.
Was not me, you killed her.

43
00:07:36,035 --> 00:07:40,873
What, you want to hurt me?
Well, I see you try.

44
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,905
Get it over with

You cost  my father money.

00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,855
Now we have to make Extra special example of the of you

47
00:07:51,932 --> 00:07:55,081
So we looked in your record
Not much to find

48
00:07:55,234 --> 00:07:57,769
But for city garbage collection
sensational

49
00:07:57,999 --> 00:07:59,880
Good benefits, but no glamour.
-Hey

50
00:08:00,802 --> 00:08:04,219
Father and mother dead.
No brothers or sisters.

51
00:08:04,642 --> 00:08:09,096
Which is too ,bad
-because I would like to take them from you too

52
00:08:10,901 --> 00:08:14,357
But you love your wife we know that.

53
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:20,270
So here the deal  you free to go
But we will have eyes on.

54
00:08:20,385 --> 00:08:23,342

you expect it, we'll be there.

55
00:08:23,572 --> 00:08:28,103
Anyone you try to make a friends or even  talk about it....

56
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:32,327
To Die, like your wife,
Because of you.

57
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:36,474
Of course you can always end it. jump
of a bridge, throw yourself  in front of the a train.

58
00:08:36,743 --> 00:08:40,774
Send your soul straight to Hell, if you believe
that crap and bullshit

59
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,885
Personally I don’t
-So go for it if i was you
.

60
00:08:47,532 --> 00:08:51,372
But I am not you, thank God.

61
00:08:52,294 --> 00:08:54,290
So do what you want.

62
00:08:54,982 --> 00:08:58,322
If you're still here tomorrow,
kill the landlady. What was his name?

63
00:08:58,514 --> 00:09:03,237

00:09:05,464 --> 00:09:08,306
clean up the mess the garbage man.

65
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,870
Alright , she is your daughter
and she is American citizen.

66
00:09:16,216 --> 00:09:19,326
How you ask what's deal with her.
That's your business.

67
00:09:20,171 --> 00:09:24,855
But i am goanna tell you pulling string is hard work
-And hard work don’t come free

68
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,770

Chinatown will be 10%. Bronx and
- Brooklyn will set upon current rate

73
00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:55,266
And fact we won’t stop shooting
-the cops and their families in the streets

74
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,108
Like dogs first time  pressure

75
00:10:00,143 --> 00:10:02,524
Things are tough all over.

76
00:10:20,264 --> 00:10:23,643

86
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,244
Because it was hurting
business, and business is serious.

87
00:12:51,744 --> 00:12:55,622
I do not understand business,
but why beet hem  if goanna  kill him anyway

00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:55,366
Luke Wright, the toughest cop in the Big Apple
sometime.

142
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:58,937
No one with better aim
But you know what your true talent?

Why come back? Why

152
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:32,651
- Like the moon.
- I missed my home.

153
00:21:36,721 --> 00:21:39,639
You were one of us, Luke.
We’re a team.

154
00:21:39,754 --> 00:21:42,596
We were family and we threw

're Going to kill the son of a bitch!

156
00:21:44,938 --> 00:21:47,626
Now you see, damn!

157
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:52,503
Hey,Hey,esy.

158
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,953
If you came back,
means you want to die.

159
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,524
Now we must do something or end up with the city.

160
00:22:02,678 --> 00:22:04,752
A bus, a train...

161
00:22:05,404 --> 00:22:08,246
But I can think is best
suicide as police.

162
00:22:09,474 --> 00:22:12,930
Come on, take it.
Shot.

163
00:22:13,237 --> 00:22:16,309
Come on, Annie is waiting for you.

164
00:22:16,617 --> 00:22:20,111
The question is do you realy think
She want to see you again.

165
00:22:21,877 --> 00:22:26,178
Actually my real talent
Is cost other people money
.

166
00:22:27,675 --> 00:22:31,515
You must know,
lose that bet.

167
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,892
You can shoot me from behind.
Not be the first time.

168
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:40,039
Why not accept it and you?

169
00:22:40,615 --> 00:22:44,455
What do you expect?
Do all around you die?

170
00:22:47,258 --> 00:22:49,255
What are you waiting for?

171
00:22:50,292 --> 00:22:53,171
For the last time, give me the numbers.

172
00:23:09,836 --> 00:23:13,407
You are a very brave girl
and intelligent.

173
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:21,279
But you know how we knew exactly where you were
and with whom?

174
00:23:21,663 --> 00:23:25,733
- Someone told him.
- Right. Guess who?

175
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:39,863
Your friend who told you about your poor little
mom.

176
00:23:40,478 --> 00:23:43,780
Works for us.

177
00:23:46,621 --> 00:23:47,927
Mei.

178
00:23:59,715 --> 00:24:01,520
In English.

179
00:24:05,552 --> 00:24:08,163
I told you to speak in English.

180
00:24:08,777 --> 00:24:10,159
Well?

181
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,882
She want tell me anything.

182
00:24:17,225 --> 00:24:21,372
My father is a patient man.
I do not.

183
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,096
Tell what you know.

184
00:24:25,711 --> 00:24:27,822
NYPD, open!

185
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:31,624
(cops)
- We reported a disturbance.

186
00:24:35,233 --> 00:24:38,152
Can do this easy or hard!

187
00:24:38,382 --> 00:24:41,377
Open the door or we caming by force.

188
00:24:41,531 --> 00:24:45,562
Of course not! If you enter
put my top five, I swear by my mother.

189
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:52,743
You there. I do not know how much time
try out.

190
00:24:53,741 --> 00:24:55,738
You must come before everything
go to hell.

191
00:24:55,891 --> 00:25:00,077
I, back to the station, not
'm in town. 'll Call you back the station,

192
00:25:01,382 --> 00:25:03,917
Well, we have a mess.
You know what I want.

193
00:25:04,032 --> 00:25:09,446
We have a deal. Bring the child,
alive if you can, if not dead.

194
00:25:09,638 --> 00:25:13,708
Local goods should be added
To my 10%. That's the new deal.

195
00:25:13,862 --> 00:25:16,089
Wait, I'm getting a call.

196
00:25:16,626 --> 00:25:17,970
Hello, Nails. What's up?

197
00:25:18,277 --> 00:25:19,775
Thanks, man.

198
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:24,882
Whatever you
the Chinese offer,to you I offer you 5% more.

199
00:25:40,855 --> 00:25:46,231
Well, the Russians are offering
a property in Brooklyn.

200
00:25:46,654 --> 00:25:49,226
I talked with my people and do not want us to go through this.

201
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:52,068
This should be between us and the Russians

202
00:25:52,874 --> 00:25:54,756
You should offer more now.

203
00:25:55,255 --> 00:25:58,557
10% in both zones,
is my last offer.

204
00:26:08,348 --> 00:26:12,188
Hello, Mack. All are willing to pay for
little girl.

205
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,953
I want what you have.

206
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:18,217
Well, I managed to get the Russians to withdraw.

207
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:22,709
I get to the end
each of these slags.

208
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,855
Okay, your offer is good.
Call my men.

209
00:26:28,047 --> 00:26:30,773
- Sure, I like you more.
- Not at all.

210
00:26:31,234 --> 00:26:36,110
You're a fucking bastard.
Mendes those instead of coming yourself.

211
00:26:37,646 --> 00:26:41,294
But I must tell you something before you send
your men damm place

212
00:26:42,292 --> 00:26:45,134
- The girl is gone.
- How it went?

213
00:26:45,978 --> 00:26:50,241
I men she escap she is on
the street, I cannot follow
.

214
00:26:50,433 --> 00:26:52,660
I hope you do something with the damned.

215
00:26:52,928 --> 00:26:57,728
If the Chinese find it first,
regret while alive.

216
00:26:58,189 --> 00:27:02,566
What is it?

217
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,176
I forget it and act.

218
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:11,820
China Girl  eleven,
speaks Mandarin and English.

219
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,544
I'm sorry, Annie.

220
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,376
They are in the Russian zone.

221
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:33,832
Looks like they're on the subway.

222
00:32:20,348 --> 00:32:23,842
Do you, the garbage collector?

223
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:27,759
You are misinformed.
Never picked up the trash.

224
00:32:27,951 --> 00:32:29,640
I got rid of it.

225
00:32:33,979 --> 00:32:37,243
Do not lose sleep.
Asked for it.

226
00:33:20,172 --> 00:33:22,169
Are you okay?

227
00:33:54,078 --> 00:33:55,498
Easy.

228
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,185
We are of the police.
All right.

229
00:33:59,684 --> 00:34:02,141
What is your name, honey?

230
00:34:02,525 --> 00:34:04,791
- It's her.
- I don’t know, to me, all I seem.

231
00:34:05,175 --> 00:34:07,287
- Have a photo?
- Yes, let me see it.

232
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:17,654
Go, New York.

233
00:34:17,769 --> 00:34:22,031
It is not the same thing twice
on the same day.

234
00:34:24,143 --> 00:34:26,102
Hey, I will not hurt you.

235
00:34:34,626 --> 00:34:36,584
What the hell did you do, girl?

236
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:55,130
All are chasing you.

237
00:34:55,399 --> 00:34:57,665
Are you telling me why you pursue?

238
00:34:57,818 --> 00:34:59,700
Do you understand?

239
00:35:00,852 --> 00:35:03,117
Do you speak English?

240
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,776
On the other side!
Go to the contrary!

241
00:35:56,836 --> 00:35:58,679
Are you crazy?

242
00:36:24,751 --> 00:36:26,134
Hold on.

243
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,004
If this continues, many people will hurt innocent
.

244
00:36:35,388 --> 00:36:36,808
Do you want that?

245
00:36:38,498 --> 00:36:40,840
Good. Then do as I say.

246
00:37:17,126 --> 00:37:18,931
Are you okay?

247
00:37:21,273 --> 00:37:22,963
Come.

248
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:25,343
Do not I have five years.

249
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:29,721
Come.

250
00:37:48,152 --> 00:37:49,803
The found and then lost.

251
00:37:49,918 --> 00:37:52,913
Captain No, not lost.
Took her by force.

252
00:37:53,144 --> 00:37:55,179
- The Russians?
- No, not the Russians.

253
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:00,478
- Luke Wright.
- What?

254
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,743
- Captain.
- Not now.

255
00:38:03,357 --> 00:38:05,047
The man wants to speak.

256
00:38:06,276 --> 00:38:08,733
- Pass it on to line 2.
- Not by phone.

257
00:38:09,309 --> 00:38:11,498
Wants me to go, you asked.

258
00:38:13,226 --> 00:38:14,800
There you go.

259
00:38:17,373 --> 00:38:19,254
Thank you, Mr. Ivanovo.

260
00:38:28,892 --> 00:38:33,154
Mr Ivanovo. Here,
Room 1012, tenth floor.

261
00:38:33,999 --> 00:38:35,228
Thank you.

262
00:38:52,929 --> 00:38:56,961
- Do you like nice hotels
- I never stayed in a nice hotel.

263
00:38:58,382 --> 00:39:00,570
No one will look in one.

264
00:39:16,698 --> 00:39:18,771
I would be a shower now.

265
00:39:19,501 --> 00:39:21,613
We could use some.

266
00:39:25,836 --> 00:39:28,793
Need to drop this down the drain.

267
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,092
Why was I saved?

268
00:39:36,434 --> 00:39:40,965
I not saved you, you saved me.
I returned the way.

269
00:39:43,461 --> 00:39:45,458
My name is Luke.

270
00:39:47,147 --> 00:39:48,376
Mei.

271
00:39:51,563 --> 00:39:53,214
Do you have parents, Mei?

272
00:39:55,019 --> 00:39:57,476
- I have a father.
- What's your name?

273
00:39:58,283 --> 00:40:02,583
- Jen Quan.
- Jen Quan?

274
00:40:04,004 --> 00:40:08,496
If we speak of it, had no children when I knew him
last.

275
00:40:09,572 --> 00:40:13,719
- And you do not look three years.
- I'm adopted.

276
00:40:14,717 --> 00:40:17,213
Do you brought from your country?

277
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:25,968
Jen  no parent timber
Why are you adopted?

278
00:40:27,312 --> 00:40:29,423
To have me.

279
00:40:34,684 --> 00:40:42,517
What about the old, the head of Jen?

280
00:40:59,028 --> 00:41:01,486
It gave me a number, a very long time.

281
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:04,980
I would go elsewhere to find another
and further instructions...

282
00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:07,207
But the Russians arrived and killed them all.

283
00:41:07,783 --> 00:41:09,818
And then the police came and I ran away.

284
00:41:10,048 --> 00:41:12,660
Father Knows Best.
Happiness for you.

285
00:41:16,346 --> 00:41:20,992
- Want to go home?
- I cause too many problems.

286
00:41:21,107 --> 00:41:22,720
Is bad business.

287
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:28,863
Number is a long and tedious.

288
00:41:28,902 --> 00:41:30,707
If I tell you.

289
00:41:30,745 --> 00:41:33,164
Do not have to.

290
00:41:34,047 --> 00:41:36,351
It's just a number not more.

291
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:42,802
You're crazy, you're not that stupid.

292
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,104
Do any of these numbers
you find interesting?

293
00:41:47,179 --> 00:41:48,869
- Some.
- Why?

294
00:41:49,867 --> 00:41:52,286
For 3 have a 7 before.

295
00:41:52,325 --> 00:41:57,124
Everyone is random, but e
of them have a 7 before,

296
00:41:57,163 --> 00:41:58,776
... and 8 have a 3 before.

297
00:41:58,814 --> 00:42:00,503
It is too much to be random.

298
00:42:00,542 --> 00:42:04,842
No, they are not.

299
00:42:05,649 --> 00:42:07,530
What do you think?

300
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:11,332
Is 7 that interests me.

301
00:42:12,176 --> 00:42:15,363
Because numbers are not words.

302
00:42:16,285 --> 00:42:21,546
Left and right are the
combination of a safe.

303
00:42:32,796 --> 00:42:34,409
- Does the hotel?
- Must.

304
00:42:34,447 --> 00:42:36,828
- Where?
- In there.

305
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:54,606
So tall, black hair in his 30.

306
00:42:54,645 --> 00:42:56,910
Security came half an hour ago.

307
00:42:56,948 --> 00:42:59,252
We cannot speak of our guests.

308
00:42:59,252 --> 00:43:01,671
So you're here? Check it out.

309
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:03,515
Sorry, we can not...

310
00:43:03,553 --> 00:43:05,550
I was with a Chinese girl of 11,

311
00:43:05,588 --> 00:43:07,854
... I'm his father and
'm worried about him.

312
00:43:07,892 --> 00:43:11,617
I'm sorry, I can call the police.

313
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:14,420
Do it and I'll blow your head.

314
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:18,221
Now tell me what room is.

315
00:43:19,181 --> 00:43:20,986
What room is?

316
00:43:24,249 --> 00:43:28,012
- Maybe I put it on the 10th floor...
- We...

317
00:43:29,472 --> 00:43:31,891
I swear I did not come with a girl.

318
00:43:31,929 --> 00:43:34,694
- In what room?
- I have to check.

319
00:43:34,732 --> 00:43:38,380
Do it fast or I shoot you, fast.

320
00:43:38,418 --> 00:43:40,569
Put ??your hands.

321
00:43:41,836 --> 00:43:43,448
Better not get involved.

322
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,754
Hands up...

323
00:43:58,347 --> 00:44:00,612
To review the entire hotel.

324
00:44:02,839 --> 00:44:05,719
Room 1012, there it is.

325
00:44:05,796 --> 00:44:07,370
You said that we seek here.

326
00:44:08,868 --> 00:44:10,519
I turned it off...

327
00:44:10,557 --> 00:44:12,593
Do not have to be on.

328
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,529
Write the numbers, only
interesting, fast.

329
00:44:34,748 --> 00:44:37,551
Seek a safe place.

330
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:39,087
If we split, I said nothing.

331
00:44:39,126 --> 00:44:41,967
- If you try to scare.
- I'm scared.

332
00:44:42,005 --> 00:44:44,424
I also remember lying...

333
00:44:44,463 --> 00:44:47,650
We are Almost there, if you see below
not kill the girl.

334
00:44:55,406 --> 00:44:56,558
Back 
Inside...

335
00:45:02,395 --> 00:45:04,852
flow them , i am goung other side.

336
00:45:40,716 --> 00:45:43,327
Over here... do not let them in.

337
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:16,580
Everybody get down, stay down...

338
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:19,651
Down...

339
00:47:14,292 --> 00:47:17,709
All rise... leave the hotel.

340
00:47:18,554 --> 00:47:21,511
Standing... we...

341
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:55,394
My Car...

342
00:48:55,471 --> 00:48:57,390
This guy took my car.

343
00:49:10,945 --> 00:49:12,519
get down sun i get less than a minute

344
00:49:38,323 --> 00:49:41,433
- Hey baby did you wanna give me the address.
- Wait a minute.

345
00:50:57,999 --> 00:51:01,186
This here, you were right
is back in town.

346
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,873
In fact it takes a while here.

347
00:51:03,873 --> 00:51:06,216
- A time
- Maybe a year.

348
00:51:15,316 --> 00:51:17,812
How are you involved in that?

349
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:20,269
I can ask you the same.

350
00:51:20,308 --> 00:51:23,034
Do not give me that.

351
00:51:23,072 --> 00:51:27,181
You've been so long in this
that not even see what happens.

352
00:51:29,139 --> 00:51:32,442
Maybe, but you do not
you saw 5 minutes ago.

353
00:51:33,325 --> 00:51:38,355
You know it's not about that.

354
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,809
When we had our men scattered
looking for terrorists,

355
00:51:42,847 --> 00:51:45,266
... I was the one who assembled the special forces to deal
,

356
00:51:45,305 --> 00:51:47,148
... with the crimes and fill the void.

357
00:51:47,148 --> 00:51:50,335
Do not forget it was me who you could
charge.

358
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:52,025
How could I forget?

359
00:51:52,063 --> 00:51:55,173
It was only police.

360
00:51:55,212 --> 00:52:00,165
I knew we needed something special,

361
00:52:00,203 --> 00:52:02,277
normal detectives would not be enough.

362
00:52:02,315 --> 00:52:07,576
Friends in places as there are unusual.

363
00:52:10,033 --> 00:52:15,371
After I sent Luke Right on, a guy who faded
for 7 years.

364
00:52:15,409 --> 00:52:17,406
Do you think the war was coming?

365
00:52:18,097 --> 00:52:21,553
Cocaine was found in sewers
Brooklyn

366
00:52:21,553 --> 00:52:24,701
and in Chinatown,

367
00:52:24,701 --> 00:52:27,773
is a dead ghost.

368
00:52:29,923 --> 00:52:32,074
It also works very well.

369
00:52:33,264 --> 00:52:36,489
But they had become greedy and want more.

370
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:39,292
He is a killer  but it is honest one.

371
00:52:39,331 --> 00:52:42,057
Prefers to shoot down everything,

372
00:52:42,057 --> 00:52:46,588
there are many people at risk in this.

373
00:52:46,626 --> 00:52:48,316
Yes, we too,

374
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:53,692
 everything is connected
that can be dangerous.

375
00:52:54,383 --> 00:52:58,146
Do not do anything else,
put them all in this.

376
00:52:59,298 --> 00:53:02,293
There's only one man that I can stop

377
00:53:03,445 --> 00:53:04,981
I'm sorry to interrupt,

378
00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:07,361
... but there was a shooting
important in the centre.

379
00:53:08,245 --> 00:53:10,510
The media is crazy,
have to take a part.

380
00:53:12,545 --> 00:53:17,345
Chao also is in the
city, and a Chinese girl.

381
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:20,302
Luke came to them before me.

382
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:21,569
- What?
- I said...

383
00:53:21,607 --> 00:53:23,719
Yes, I heard you the first time.

384
00:53:27,175 --> 00:53:29,517
Close all exits Manhattan

385
00:53:29,555 --> 00:53:32,397
make sure that neither he nor the girl
escape and get your commission,

386
00:53:32,435 --> 00:53:34,010
if they escape,

387
00:53:34,048 --> 00:53:37,158
I'll give you a shovel
for your own grave.

388
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:40,768
This girl cannot leave the city.

389
00:54:47,503 --> 00:54:48,962
Recovered the girl,

390
00:54:48,962 --> 00:54:51,113
but the information may have leaked
.

391
00:54:51,151 --> 00:54:52,380
Will change the time frame.

392
00:54:52,418 --> 00:54:55,145
Impossible, not now with all this fuss
.

393
00:54:55,183 --> 00:54:59,100
We must do something.

394
00:54:59,176 --> 00:55:01,711
- Where?
- I'll let you know.

395
00:55:01,749 --> 00:55:04,053
What are you doing?

396
00:55:08,814 --> 00:55:12,232
Slow down, stop the car.

397
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:15,534
Shalt bring no whores in my car.

398
00:55:16,494 --> 00:55:18,375
Just wait.

399
00:55:24,327 --> 00:55:26,247
Good...

400
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:39,072
We have no reservation.

401
00:55:39,993 --> 00:55:43,334
Okay, I can find you something.

402
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:48,902
Who something down or on the balcony?

403
00:55:49,708 --> 00:55:52,050
I can put them up if they want.

404
00:55:58,962 --> 00:56:01,842
Lord prefers something.

405
00:56:02,917 --> 00:56:05,298
We just sit at the bar.

406
00:56:08,178 --> 00:56:10,789
Kiss me away from here.

407
00:56:10,789 --> 00:56:13,361
- But...
- This will be sufficient.

408
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,128
Do not ever...

409
00:56:26,033 --> 00:56:28,912
A White Russian, please.

410
00:57:08,155 --> 00:57:10,689
What is manages and where parked?

411
00:57:12,955 --> 00:57:15,259
A silver truck in the alley.

412
00:57:29,466 --> 00:57:32,231
- Vassily.
- Not at all.

413
00:57:33,536 --> 00:57:34,995
Who you talking about?

414
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:39,565
The boy who has been
killing your kids.

415
00:57:40,985 --> 00:57:43,673
- What I want is...
- I do not care.

416
00:57:43,712 --> 00:57:46,169
Do you think it has to blackmail
Vassily?

417
00:57:46,208 --> 00:57:47,744
Kill him and go to hell.

418
00:57:47,782 --> 00:57:50,815
I will go to hell but not
kill his son,

419
00:57:50,815 --> 00:57:53,926
... I will keep close as a pet.

420
00:57:53,964 --> 00:57:57,151
Do you think you can look in,

421
00:57:57,151 --> 00:58:01,144
... the mirror afterwards? It will not.

422
00:58:01,836 --> 00:58:05,176
So
tell me everything you know about its operation.

423
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:07,941
What will you do? Go to the police.

424
00:58:08,632 --> 00:58:11,934
Who talked about the police?

425
00:58:12,817 --> 00:58:16,696
Will tell you all the competition,
who have not killed.

426
00:58:16,734 --> 00:58:19,575
Do not think I will because it will,

427
00:58:19,614 --> 00:58:24,452
... I'll take your wife and your son
trophy trophy.

428
00:58:26,487 --> 00:58:30,519
And you cannot remember anything,

429
00:58:30,557 --> 00:58:32,823
... that does not have to spend.

430
00:58:32,823 --> 00:58:34,167
What do you want?

431
00:58:34,819 --> 00:58:36,739
I want what is in the safe.

432
00:58:36,739 --> 00:58:39,581
- Safe
- She gave me the combination.

433
00:58:42,614 --> 00:58:44,765
$ 30 million.

434
00:58:45,609 --> 00:58:47,222
The girl was our way to reach the second number
.

435
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:49,104
What's in the second safe?

436
00:58:49,142 --> 00:58:53,020
Should be worth 30 million dollars.

437
00:58:53,059 --> 00:58:55,593
- For whom?
- No idea.

438
00:58:56,399 --> 00:58:59,241
Do not make me smart.

439
00:59:00,201 --> 00:59:02,773
So hear is the deal.

440
00:59:02,812 --> 00:59:05,576
Take the first box, take the money,

441
00:59:05,615 --> 00:59:08,571
... and let you go to your son,
traicióname and will be the end of your world.

442
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:10,146
You have my word.

443
00:59:10,184 --> 00:59:12,334
Idiot, is in working.

444
00:59:12,373 --> 00:59:16,904
You need a ejecito  to
closer to that safe.

445
00:59:16,904 --> 00:59:18,440
The type of army that I have.

446
00:59:18,478 --> 00:59:20,782
What had.

447
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:24,276
It is shrinking by the minute.

448
00:59:25,006 --> 00:59:28,154
Is the last chance for your child.

449
00:59:32,224 --> 00:59:34,375
Do I want to kill, garbage man?

450
00:59:36,602 --> 00:59:38,599
You could have killed us that day,

451
00:59:38,637 --> 00:59:43,859
... but you did nothing, why?

452
00:59:44,704 --> 00:59:48,044
I guess what
box gave you motivation,garbage man.

453
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:51,500
If you stop talking,

454
00:59:52,383 --> 00:59:53,919
... and began to pray,

455
00:59:53,919 --> 00:59:56,799
... because the girl is alive.

456
01:00:00,370 --> 01:00:01,791
pray.

457
01:00:10,354 --> 01:00:11,698
When and where?

458
01:00:11,698 --> 01:00:14,117
On the interception, under the bridge
in an hour.

459
01:00:17,726 --> 01:00:21,451
I'm sorry I suggested,
had to.

460
01:00:22,795 --> 01:00:24,638
- Was by...
-... business, I know.

461
01:00:24,676 --> 01:00:28,823
It's good to understand,
finish with this,

462
01:00:29,937 --> 01:00:31,818
 And you'll be
me and Uncle Han

463
01:00:32,778 --> 01:00:37,155
I promise to be a better father than
which I leave to your mother.

464
01:00:40,611 --> 01:00:43,376
No one in the world
who cares for you.

465
01:00:44,797 --> 01:00:46,256
Do you know, right?

466
01:01:15,016 --> 01:01:16,667
We get to see.

467
01:01:16,705 --> 01:01:20,622
- Almost...
- What about your friend?

468
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:23,963
is In the hospital, you idiot, you broke
trachea.

469
01:01:24,001 --> 01:01:26,267
I hope you can arreglársela.

470
01:01:27,303 --> 01:01:30,721
- Yeah, what if you...?
- Hey, not yet.

471
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:33,793
We saw in a while, Luke.

472
01:01:33,793 --> 01:01:35,597
I cannot say I missed you.

473
01:01:36,596 --> 01:01:40,551
So let's get down to business

474
01:01:44,544 --> 01:01:47,232
Okay, let's see.

475
01:02:04,703 --> 01:02:06,354
Thats good.

476
01:02:19,409 --> 01:02:20,984
I have the whole night with restaurants,

477
01:02:21,022 --> 01:02:24,286
but I could not eat.

478
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,543
Do you have a matchbox?

479
01:02:31,543 --> 01:02:34,385
Hell, you asked us to come,

480
01:02:34,385 --> 01:02:37,994
 but does not hear this idiot.

481
01:02:38,032 --> 01:02:40,183
Shut up.

482
01:02:41,027 --> 01:02:42,640
Have not you left?

483
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:56,271
Hey, what's that?

484
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:58,614
The combinationto the  safe with
30 million box in it.

485
01:02:58,652 --> 01:03:01,071
What the hell, you idiot?

486
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:03,068
Solo is here now,

487
01:03:03,759 --> 01:03:06,716
remember the next time you talk with me.

488
01:03:06,754 --> 01:03:10,594
Why we are here now?

489
01:03:10,594 --> 01:03:14,856
Because there are many police who collect
of casinos in Chinatown.

490
01:03:15,586 --> 01:03:19,349
Where else sectarian that amount?

491
01:03:19,387 --> 01:03:22,881
How do we know
says the truth? He's an idiot.

492
01:03:26,107 --> 01:03:27,988
There is an exchange tonight,

493
01:03:27,988 --> 01:03:30,100
thats is right half the 
-deal is within the casino,

494
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:33,633
to get to the other the
call, my old friends.

495
01:03:33,671 --> 01:03:37,664
30 million split six ways i still A lot of money.

496
01:03:40,352 --> 01:03:45,843
Risked much, we all know
, has a bright future.

497
01:03:45,843 --> 01:03:49,145
Promised by whom, Sauna?

498
01:03:49,184 --> 01:03:54,905
Cannot believe  the guy,
think you leave with what you know?

499
01:03:54,944 --> 01:03:56,902
What does that mean?

500
01:03:56,902 --> 01:04:00,857
That we have to do something right.

501
01:04:00,895 --> 01:04:04,121
30 million would be a good pension.

502
01:04:04,121 --> 01:04:05,657
What will change?

503
01:04:05,733 --> 01:04:08,728
If I knew
not be here with you.

504
01:04:10,226 --> 01:04:13,643
- Well.
- Think of the headlines.

505
01:04:13,682 --> 01:04:17,099
Heroic police
demolished illegal gambling network.

506
01:04:17,829 --> 01:04:22,475
1 million and a half
head, nothing know nothing.

507
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:41,405
Well, who has been there?

508
01:04:42,096 --> 01:04:44,093
For God, who has entered?

509
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:48,893
You two first.

510
01:04:48,893 --> 01:04:51,120
Remember that I have the combination.

511
01:04:51,121 --> 01:04:54,821
did you want that mony wach my back

512
01:08:21,771 --> 01:08:24,421
Damn, captain.

513
01:08:27,838 --> 01:08:30,603
Shit, not
shoots a man in the back.

514
01:08:31,256 --> 01:08:34,059
- Well, where are we going?
- this way.

515
01:08:35,134 --> 01:08:36,516
Move.

516
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:16,373
We need to move.

517
01:09:16,412 --> 01:09:18,946
- Damn door.
- I do not wait.

518
01:09:42,369 --> 01:09:44,058
Bastards... begin.

519
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:56,614
So we do this, put the guns down.

520
01:09:56,653 --> 01:10:01,107
The box, if you want dispárenme.

521
01:10:01,145 --> 01:10:04,486
But think about it.

522
01:10:07,366 --> 01:10:09,247
On the floor.

523
01:10:42,961 --> 01:10:44,804
Idiot, what are you trying to do?

524
01:10:44,842 --> 01:10:47,530
I should miss a turn, hopefully.

525
01:11:04,348 --> 01:11:05,846
Will survive.

526
01:11:07,919 --> 01:11:09,916
Left 26.

527
01:11:26,043 --> 01:11:28,040
Captain,wolf  what hell  happened here?

528
01:11:28,078 --> 01:11:30,075
What do you think? We made a raid,

529
01:11:30,113 --> 01:11:32,763
... dead and police are all entering.

530
01:11:32,763 --> 01:11:34,107
Captain wolf.
did you need ambulance

531
01:11:34,145 --> 01:11:37,524
I take you to evidence, 
I have no time for ambulances
.

532
01:11:41,249 --> 01:11:45,511
Well, we continue to plan,

533
01:11:45,549 --> 01:11:48,084
almost drive.

534
01:11:53,075 --> 01:11:55,840
We...

535
01:11:57,722 --> 01:11:59,987
i am not gonna kill you.

536
01:12:00,025 --> 01:12:01,600
 but i didnt say you biting  as a risk.

537
01:12:09,395 --> 01:12:12,428
I have the money.

538
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:17,842
- What?
- You heard me.

539
01:12:18,610 --> 01:12:22,450
30 million, 500 thousand in thousand p...

540
01:12:22,488 --> 01:12:26,712
No, you have to do is calm down
to talk like adults.

541
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:29,323
shuted dady, do not want to talk.

542
01:12:29,361 --> 01:12:32,088
Do not want to talk to you, but your boyfriend
.

543
01:12:36,158 --> 01:12:39,345
- Alex.
- hase been w...Alex.

544
01:12:40,075 --> 01:12:42,532
How did you get this number?

545
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:45,181
Please do not underestimate me.

546
01:12:45,182 --> 01:12:47,182
( laughing)

547
01:12:46,833 --> 01:12:51,325
You do need is better than Annie.

548
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:54,320
Never understood how you
 hook up with an ugly like her.

549
01:12:54,359 --> 01:12:58,045
It was never about her beauty,
rather his sense of humour.

550
01:12:58,045 --> 01:13:00,349
It's not so funny, right?

551
01:13:00,387 --> 01:13:02,614
It is not, but I do not.

552
01:13:04,227 --> 01:13:07,836
I have the money, I had to kill many people
to get it.

553
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:13,020
Also I have the combination,
What's in the other box?

554
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:15,170
A disc,

555
01:13:15,209 --> 01:13:17,551
Names, transfers of money.

556
01:13:18,204 --> 01:13:21,237
When our commanders
sent us to clean,

557
01:13:21,276 --> 01:13:22,696
Danny disorder,

558
01:13:22,735 --> 01:13:24,847
Return ...
Danny looked the other way.

559
01:13:24,847 --> 01:13:27,074
Foreclosed properties
terrorists,

560
01:13:27,112 --> 01:13:29,262
were transferred to his private account.

561
01:13:29,301 --> 01:13:32,757
It's amazing what people
lets you do when you protect.

562
01:13:32,795 --> 01:13:36,174
It's amazing how much trash
there waiting to be exploited.

563
01:13:36,174 --> 01:13:38,017
- Like you.
- I left it.

564
01:13:38,055 --> 01:13:41,435
With the help of those who killed
was much easier.

565
01:13:41,473 --> 01:13:44,430
You thought to compensate
hiding,

566
01:13:44,468 --> 01:13:46,541
... and leaving you hit for everyone.

567
01:13:46,541 --> 01:13:50,919
Do not give me sermons,
me pay for my services.

568
01:13:51,994 --> 01:13:55,565
You sold the disc to the Chinese
to blackmail us.

569
01:13:55,603 --> 01:13:59,213
Take the 30 million
and go to the Bahamas.

570
01:13:59,251 --> 01:14:01,824
Probably but who knows, right?

571
01:14:01,824 --> 01:14:03,821
So now what?

572
01:14:03,859 --> 01:14:06,508
Now you deal with me.

573
01:14:06,547 --> 01:14:10,310
- Vault.
- What do you mean?

574
01:14:12,076 --> 01:14:14,918
Got the money, the Chinese
have nothing you want.

575
01:14:14,956 --> 01:14:17,529
Not have something that interests me.

576
01:14:35,038 --> 01:14:38,340
Give the combination to the
girl and she will give our number.

577
01:14:38,379 --> 01:14:40,683
You to our place and we are yours,

578
01:14:40,721 --> 01:14:43,447
... when we drive
explain the code.

579
01:14:43,486 --> 01:14:46,020
And then you have the money.

580
01:14:46,058 --> 01:14:49,591
That's the deal, are you sure?

581
01:14:49,629 --> 01:14:52,932
It's a long number, you need to copy it.

582
01:14:54,813 --> 01:14:56,771
Good thing I brought a pen.

583
01:15:05,603 --> 01:15:07,292
Close your eyes.

584
01:15:09,481 --> 01:15:11,017
As you wish.

585
01:15:23,228 --> 01:15:25,147
Luke...

586
01:15:25,186 --> 01:15:29,141
The same place, just you and me.

587
01:15:31,445 --> 01:15:33,211
Are you a friend of Luke?

588
01:15:35,361 --> 01:15:37,473
Not in regards to you.

589
01:15:49,645 --> 01:15:52,948
The violence in the city with a bloody
continuous shooting

590
01:15:52,948 --> 01:15:56,019
... at a club in the Barrio Chino
less than an hour.

591
01:15:56,058 --> 01:15:58,323
- This is going hand in hand.
- Do you agree?

592
01:15:58,362 --> 01:16:00,128
Thank you for that deduction.

593
01:16:01,549 --> 01:16:04,237
Alex Rosen  is in line with private
says it's urgent.

594
01:16:05,849 --> 01:16:08,153
Not now.

595
01:16:08,192 --> 01:16:10,112
Why not call me the phone?

596
01:16:10,726 --> 01:16:12,876
Did not I tell you to spend all my...?

597
01:16:14,911 --> 01:16:17,369
The security here is very bad.

598
01:16:19,442 --> 01:16:22,668
It's because I thought it was crazy to come here
,

599
01:16:22,706 --> 01:16:24,357
... and do that, you're crazy.

600
01:16:24,396 --> 01:16:27,506
There is nothing like this disc.

601
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:33,189
Do you think I'll let one come to claim me
Chinese here?

602
01:16:33,227 --> 01:16:34,993
It is in a safe way from here.

603
01:16:35,032 --> 01:16:36,798
Do not think you're stupid.

604
01:16:36,837 --> 01:16:39,524
Do not believe at all that
have a single copy.

605
01:16:40,331 --> 01:16:43,518
If you give me the disc,

606
01:16:44,555 --> 01:16:47,780
... do not kill but will spend
the rest of your life wishing for it.

607
01:16:56,420 --> 01:16:57,955
Satisfied?

608
01:16:57,994 --> 01:17:00,797
Make sure there is something else.

609
01:17:10,012 --> 01:17:12,163
Alex will kill you, you know?

610
01:17:12,201 --> 01:17:14,659
Yeh
Probably.

611
01:17:59,239 --> 01:18:01,696
By God, you look terrible.

612
01:18:02,349 --> 01:18:06,880
Alcohol is , you know how it is.

613
01:18:08,301 --> 01:18:10,067
But I feel good.

614
01:18:12,563 --> 01:18:16,479
I was thinking about how many bodies we
here.

615
01:18:17,977 --> 01:18:20,166
To tell the tale.

616
01:18:21,164 --> 01:18:23,583
Everything as it should.

617
01:18:27,461 --> 01:18:29,611
Alex...

618
01:18:30,418 --> 01:18:33,682
My name, I visited,

619
01:18:34,949 --> 01:18:38,021
... I have to admit I did not see it coming.

620
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:41,131
You have the drive and money.

621
01:18:42,129 --> 01:18:46,161
Why are you so interested?

622
01:18:48,465 --> 01:18:50,807
Life.

623
01:18:53,226 --> 01:18:55,568
Enjoy it while you can,

624
01:18:55,607 --> 01:18:58,333
... for her
yours will be much shorter.

625
01:19:02,288 --> 01:19:03,901
Your car...

626
01:19:06,819 --> 01:19:09,277
O bank

627
01:19:10,928 --> 01:19:14,499
... or maybe donate it to charity.

628
01:19:16,495 --> 01:19:18,300
For goodness.

629
01:19:20,834 --> 01:19:23,637
If you have money
to find out the hard way.

630
01:20:17,471 --> 01:20:18,892
Are you okay?

631
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:21,734
I saw him fight before,

632
01:20:21,772 --> 01:20:23,999
... I would have gone wrong.

633
01:20:24,037 --> 01:20:26,418
Right.

634
01:20:27,954 --> 01:20:31,563
You saved me again.

635
01:20:32,331 --> 01:20:34,443
We were saved.

636
01:20:38,974 --> 01:20:43,582
I know how you feel, let me take the second
garbage truck.

637
01:20:46,001 --> 01:20:48,305
Make sure she has what he deserves.

638
01:20:50,993 --> 01:20:52,644
$ 15 000.

639
01:20:53,834 --> 01:20:57,405
So I know that you enjoy.

640
01:20:57,444 --> 01:21:01,514
I am safe, not the deal.

641
01:21:03,395 --> 01:21:04,970
I,

642
01:21:08,272 --> 01:21:11,152
... maybe in the end everything is at risk.

643
01:21:57,114 --> 01:21:59,149
Watch where you walk.

644
01:21:59,188 --> 01:22:01,530
- Keep walking.
- Sorry.

645
01:22:01,568 --> 01:22:03,373
Facking New York day.

646
01:22:14,508 --> 01:22:16,236
Think number 5
How many more?

647
01:22:18,847 --> 01:22:20,537
That's all,

648
01:22:20,575 --> 01:22:21,881
Security  box all over the city
disk copies are all over the city,

649
01:22:21,919 --> 01:22:25,145
... if we look for many people
major regret.

650
01:22:25,183 --> 01:22:28,178
Security is better for us.

651
01:22:28,908 --> 01:22:33,324
- What now?
- We leave the city.

652
01:22:34,936 --> 01:22:36,895
You are a kid,

653
01:22:36,895 --> 01:22:42,001
... I not sure i could be good father.

654
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:44,497
i don’t wanna know my fathers.

655
01:22:46,110 --> 01:22:48,184
Do you want to be my friend?

656
01:22:49,451 --> 01:22:52,062
It is my dying  day

657
01:22:56,708 --> 01:23:00,317
I am going to inform the school
For gifted kids this year

658
01:23:00,317 --> 01:23:04,272
that’s nice drive
All tree of shit

659
01:23:06,423 --> 01:23:08,189
Are we safe?

660
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:13,603
A Day after Day,
-Day after Day.
