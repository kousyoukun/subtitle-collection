1
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,412
片名：《火線反擊》

2
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:39,711
布魯克林，紐約，一小時前

3
00:00:37,224 --> 00:00:40,394
把她帶過來！輕點，她只是個孩子！

4
00:00:40,858 --> 00:00:42,158
好吧，我大可以殺了她

5
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,581
你在騙我
You're lying to me.

6
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,132
沒有！我不知道你在說什麼
I'm not.
I don't know what you're talking about.

7
00:00:51,304 --> 00:00:54,091
我不知道你想要什麼，我發誓
I don't know what you want from me.
I swear I don't.

8
00:00:54,265 --> 00:00:55,925
我有三個孩子
I have three children.

9
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,101
作為父親，首先要學會的
The first thing you have to learn
as a father is to know

10
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,726
就是知道你的孩子何時在欺騙你
when your children are lying to you.

11
00:01:03,816 --> 00:01:06,853
你在欺騙我，如果你不說真話
You're lying to me,
and if you don't stop,

12
00:01:07,028 --> 00:01:10,776
我就要用你們那些有名的手段
I'm going to use one of those tortures
your people are so famous for

13
00:01:10,948 --> 00:01:14,567
來折磨你弱小的身體，直到你告訴我一切
on your little body
until you tell me what I want to know.

14
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:26,122
最後一次，告訴我那些數字
For the last time,
give me the numbers.

15
00:01:26,948 --> 00:01:31,771
204,35倍，是另外一種算法，加起來是350

16
00:01:28,527 --> 00:01:31,771
南京，中國，一年前

17
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:36,569
如果用另外一種算法，加起來是365

18
00:01:36,617 --> 00:01:38,654
只有一個算法是對的

19
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:40,948
（兩人都做錯了，定義域是X|X≠-2，
嘴上說的和黑板上的也牛頭不對馬嘴）

20
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:43,659
蘇先生，我沒有不尊重你的意思

21
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:46,472
但是你的算法是錯的

22
00:01:52,627 --> 00:01:53,721
梅

23
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,067
我們要把你轉去另一個學校

24
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,361
可是我的朋友都在這兒，而且我的媽媽...

25
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:02,011
梅，你太聰明了，你是個天才

26
00:02:02,084 --> 00:02:03,888
你該上一個特殊的學校

27
00:02:03,936 --> 00:02:06,703
你可以找新朋友的

28
00:02:06,768 --> 00:02:11,187
別難過，梅，我們永遠都是你的朋友，聽說北京的小孩人都很好的

29
00:02:11,252 --> 00:02:13,481
你在那兒會過得很開心的

30
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,670
我根本就不喜歡數學

31
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:19,945
我喜歡我現在的朋友，我不想要交新的朋友，我不喜歡數學

32
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,031
你來做數學，我們給你寫信，

33
00:02:22,106 --> 00:02:24,846
我們每個星期都給你往北京寫封信

34
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:25,941
你發誓？

35
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:29,225
當然，你想讓我們失去一個有名的朋友嗎？

36
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:31,232
不，梅，我們永遠都是你的...

37
00:02:31,971 --> 00:02:32,903
梅！
Mei!

38
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:39,165
新澤西聯航中心球館

39
00:02:47,462 --> 00:02:49,419
你怎麼還敢來這？
How dare you come here!
You have no right!

40
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:52,293
- 媽媽！別打了！住手！
- 你沒資格待在這裡！沒資格！
- Ma, enough! Stop!
- You've no right to be here. No right!

41
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:56,334
你應該被關在監獄裡！監獄裡！
You should be in jail!
You should be in jail!

42
00:02:58,514 --> 00:03:00,721
滾出去！你給我滾出去！
You get out of here!
You get out of here.

43
00:03:00,892 --> 00:03:03,465
- 對不起
- 我要殺掉你！我會殺掉你的！
- I'm sorry.
- I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

44
00:03:16,824 --> 00:03:19,446
你個廢物！那孩子不應該出現在擂台上！
Piece of garbage. The kid
should never been in there with me.

45
00:03:20,453 --> 00:03:22,113
路克，別這樣！你瘋了嗎？
Luke, come on. What, are you crazy, man?

46
00:03:22,288 --> 00:03:25,123
- 走開！
- 給我走開！
- Get off.
- Get off, now!

47
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,203
我從來都不喜歡你，路克
I never liked you, Luke.

48
00:03:27,376 --> 00:03:30,377
你比擂台上90%的人都厲害
You're a betterfighter than 90%
of the guys you go in the cage with,

49
00:03:30,546 --> 00:03:33,216
但你卻任人蹂躪
but you just let 'em pound on you
like you're a side of beef.

50
00:03:33,382 --> 00:03:35,790
你幾乎輸給過擂台上的每一個笨蛋
You already lost to every chump
in the circuit.

51
00:03:35,968 --> 00:03:37,961
但是昨晚
But last night, of all nights,

52
00:03:38,137 --> 00:03:40,462
你應該在第二輪輸掉的，你個混蛋
you're supposed to go down
in the second, you son of a bitch.

53
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,838
- 僅僅一拳！
- 退後！
- Once.
- Back off.

54
00:03:42,016 --> 00:03:44,590
我就打了他一拳！你從哪裡找到他的，操場？
I hit him once. Where'd you find him,
the fucking playground?

55
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:46,726
Youtube，你個混蛋
YouTube, you asshole.

56
00:03:46,896 --> 00:03:49,731
在你把他打暈前，那個孩子還是個網絡紅人
The kid's an internet sensation
until you put him in a coma,

57
00:03:49,857 --> 00:03:52,775
坦白說，我並不關心這個
which frankly
I do not give a shit about.

58
00:03:52,944 --> 00:03:54,983
但是你讓我輸掉了100萬美元
But you cost me a million dollars,

59
00:03:55,154 --> 00:03:58,488
當然這和你讓德切斯基輸掉的比起來就不算什麼了
which is nothing
compared what you cost Docheski.

60
00:03:58,658 --> 00:04:00,983
很好！這個名字耳熟吧？
Yeah. You recognise the name?

61
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,532
他在你身上下了大賭注
He was betting on you big time
to take the dive.

62
00:04:03,746 --> 00:04:05,371
他會把這一切都怪罪到我頭上來的
And he's gonna take it out on me too

63
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,790
因為他知道這件事情是我這白癡搞出來的
'cause he knows I'm the schmuck
that set this whole thing up.

64
00:04:09,752 --> 00:04:14,498
除非我把你的腦袋送給他
Unless I deliver your head
with a down payment.

65
00:04:15,425 --> 00:04:16,883
你知道俄國人是什麼樣子的
You know how the Russians are.

66
00:04:33,192 --> 00:04:35,232
梅
Mei.

67
00:04:35,403 --> 00:04:37,146
梅
Mei.

68
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:42,327
這是我的侄女，白玉

69
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:44,256
認識吧？

70
00:04:44,373 --> 00:04:46,394
她在我朋友的班裡

71
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:50,092
她說啊，你的腦筋啊很像電腦

72
00:04:51,015 --> 00:04:55,240
我跟你的老師講過了，他也這樣說

73
00:04:56,331 --> 00:04:58,391
你知道了吧

74
00:05:00,205 --> 00:05:02,347
很可愛啊

75
00:05:02,655 --> 00:05:10,862
電腦很討厭，太容易留下痕跡，他們還說...

76
00:05:11,588 --> 00:05:12,750
走開呀，走開！

77
00:05:16,077 --> 00:05:20,960
你學的東西你不會忘的，是不是？

78
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:34,080
那我到你的家，把你的媽媽殺掉好不好啊！

79
00:05:47,123 --> 00:05:48,427
很好，很好

80
00:05:48,817 --> 00:05:50,990
看來他們說的對了

81
00:05:51,306 --> 00:05:56,412
蘇先生告訴我你小的時候你爸爸已經走掉了

82
00:05:56,486 --> 00:06:00,218
你的媽媽現在很病了

83
00:06:01,498 --> 00:06:05,548
很快你變成一個人，你喜歡孤獨嗎？

84
00:06:07,843 --> 00:06:13,740
放心，我們會好好照顧你的媽媽

85
00:06:14,952 --> 00:06:17,266
張，你的新爸爸

86
00:06:17,341 --> 00:06:21,863
他呢會帶你漂洋過海，不過那邊那裡的人呢很喜歡

87
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,409
找我們的麻煩，所以我要你

88
00:06:24,543 --> 00:06:26,959
幫我們算一算

89
00:06:29,058 --> 00:06:32,178
你打對號碼了，有什麼事就留言吧
You got the right number,
so leave the right message.

90
00:06:32,353 --> 00:06:34,974
聽到後立刻給我回電，安妮，立刻
Call me when you get this, Annie.
I mean right away.

91
00:06:35,148 --> 00:06:36,725
如果你出去了，別回家
If you're out, don't go home.

92
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:38,939
我不是在嚇唬你，記得趕緊回電話
If I'm scaring you, that's good.
Call me.

93
00:06:42,905 --> 00:06:44,898
安妮？
Annie?

94
00:07:11,142 --> 00:07:13,135
就這樣？
That's it?

95
00:07:13,936 --> 00:07:17,187
我聽說你是個硬漢啊
I heard you were
some kind of a tough guy.

96
00:07:17,356 --> 00:07:19,847
不掙扎下？
No fighting?

97
00:07:20,026 --> 00:07:22,943
就直接跪在地上像只求死的狗一樣？
You're just going to sit on the floor
like a dog who wants to die?

98
00:07:23,071 --> 00:07:25,063
不好意思搞得那麼亂
Sorry it had to be so messy.

99
00:07:26,783 --> 00:07:28,775
這些家伙還在學習中
The boy is still learning.

100
00:07:29,619 --> 00:07:32,573
我雖然不是醫生，但我想她有孩子了
And I'm not a doctor,
but I think she was eating for two.

101
00:07:32,747 --> 00:07:34,953
我們就像查爾斯•曼森家一樣
We're like Charlie Manson family, no?

102
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:39,127
我父親本想派其他人來的，但我想鍛煉下
My father was going to send
someone else, but I'm making my bones.

103
00:07:41,214 --> 00:07:44,333
你就靠殺害那些沒有還手能力的人來鍛煉
You make your bones by killing someone
who can hurt you back.

104
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:47,510
那會是誰呢？你？
And who would that be? You?

105
00:07:47,678 --> 00:07:49,837
好吧，當然是你
Well, why not?

106
00:07:50,014 --> 00:07:52,090
你剛殺了你老婆
You just killed your wife.

107
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:54,674
我沒殺她，是你殺的！
I didn't kill her. You did.

108
00:07:55,978 --> 00:07:59,145
但是，你想傷害我？很好
Look, you want to hurt me? Good.

109
00:07:59,315 --> 00:08:01,308
我倒想看看你能做些什麼
I want to see you try.

110
00:08:02,443 --> 00:08:04,187
殺了我吧
Get it over with.

111
00:08:04,362 --> 00:08:08,988
殺了你？你讓我父親輸錢，讓我的家族難堪
Over? You cost my father money,
made my family look bad.

112
00:08:09,117 --> 00:08:12,320
現在我們想把你作為一個特例對待
Now we're going to make
an extra special example out of you.

113
00:08:12,495 --> 00:08:15,781
我們查過你的檔案，沒有什麼有趣的東西
So, we looked into your records.
Not much to find.

114
00:08:15,998 --> 00:08:18,536
為城市的衛生系統工作
Work for city,
garbage collection, sanitation.

115
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:21,663
收益不錯，但是缺乏魅力，不是麼？
Good benefits but no glamour, eh?

116
00:08:21,838 --> 00:08:25,705
父母雙亡，沒有兄弟姐妹
Father and mother dead,
no brothers or sisters,

117
00:08:25,883 --> 00:08:27,757
這真是糟糕
which is too bad,

118
00:08:27,927 --> 00:08:30,418
我本想把他們都干掉的
because I would like
to take them from you too.

119
00:08:32,265 --> 00:08:36,013
但是你愛你的老婆，我們知道這點
But you love your wife.
We know that.

120
00:08:36,936 --> 00:08:38,347
那麼，這樣子說定了：
So here's the deal.

121
00:08:38,521 --> 00:08:41,688
你可以走了，不過我們會盯著你的
You're free to go,
but we will have eyes on you.

122
00:08:41,858 --> 00:08:45,274
不是一直，但是我們會在你最不希望出現的時候出現
Not always, but when
you least expect it, we'll be there.

123
00:08:45,445 --> 00:08:47,936
任何一個你想結交的人，甚至是交談過的
Anyone you try to make friends with
or even talk to,

124
00:08:48,114 --> 00:08:50,569
反正是有過任何交集的人
other than ordering a hot dog
or something,

125
00:08:50,742 --> 00:08:54,905
都會像你老婆一樣因你而死
will die, like your wife,
because of you.

126
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:57,238
當然你可以隨時結束這一切！跳橋
Of course, you can always end it,
jump off a bridge,

127
00:08:57,415 --> 00:08:59,123
臥軌
throw yourself in front of a train,

128
00:08:59,292 --> 00:09:02,827
將你的不朽的靈魂送去地獄，如果你相信這些狗屁
damn your eternal soul to hell,
if you believe in that kind of bullshit.

129
00:09:03,045 --> 00:09:04,705
就我個人來說，我不相信
Personally, I don't.

130
00:09:04,881 --> 00:09:07,087
所以，如果我是你，我寧願去自殺
So I'd go for it if I were you.

131
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,842
但是我不是你
But I am not you.

132
00:09:13,055 --> 00:09:15,344
感謝上帝
Thank God.

133
00:09:15,516 --> 00:09:17,924
所以做你想做的事吧
So do what you want.

134
00:09:18,102 --> 00:09:20,593
如果你明天還在這，我們會殺掉房東
If you're still here tomorrow,
we're going to kill the landlady.

135
00:09:20,772 --> 00:09:23,309
- 她叫什麼名字？
- 特巴洛斯基
- What was her name?
- Tobolovsky.

136
00:09:23,483 --> 00:09:25,641
特巴洛斯基夫人
Mrs Tobolovsky.

137
00:09:25,818 --> 00:09:27,811
很好
Nice lady.

138
00:09:28,821 --> 00:09:30,897
收拾一下吧，清潔工
Clean up the mess, garbage man.

139
00:09:36,537 --> 00:09:39,622
好了！她是你女兒，她也是美國公民
All right, she's your daughter
and she's an American citizen.

140
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:43,578
我不會打聽你們的關系，這是你們的事
I ain't gonna ask what the deal is
with her. That's your business.

141
00:09:44,462 --> 00:09:47,463
不過我想說的是，找關系是很困難的
But I'm gonna tell you,
pulling strings is hard work,

142
00:09:47,632 --> 00:09:49,589
困難的工作一般不會免費
and hard work don't come free.

143
00:09:52,136 --> 00:09:53,630
開個價吧，沃夫隊長
Your price, Captain Wolf?

144
00:09:55,098 --> 00:09:57,174
中國城轄區多交20%
Chinatown precinct take goes up 20%.

145
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:01,976
布朗克斯，布魯克林每個月各漲10%
Bronx 121st, Brooklyn divisions,
each go up by 10%, monthly.

146
00:10:02,146 --> 00:10:05,432
這個價格對於一個小女孩的護照和文書工作來說太過分了
That's a steep price for a passport
and some papers for a little girl.

147
00:10:06,859 --> 00:10:08,519
現在的日子都不好過啊
Things are tough all over.

148
00:10:13,783 --> 00:10:15,242
中國城加10%
Chinatown gets upped 10%.

149
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,782
布朗克斯和布魯克林不變
Bronx and Brooklyn will settle
for the current rate

150
00:10:17,954 --> 00:10:19,578
然後我們在感受到壓力的時候
and the fact
that we won't start shooting

151
00:10:19,747 --> 00:10:24,124
不會隨意射殺街上的警察和警察家屬
cops and their families in the streets
like dogs at the first sign of pressure.

152
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:28,037
現在的日子都不好過啊
Things are tough all over.

153
00:10:47,024 --> 00:10:49,480
嘿，朋友，我見過你，我看過你在新澤西的拳擊
Hey, man, I know you.
I saw yourfight in Jersey.

154
00:10:49,652 --> 00:10:52,404
實在是太棒了，你輕松干掉了那家伙
It was really good.
You knocked that guy out.

155
00:10:52,572 --> 00:10:56,154
- 不是的
- 我有好東西，兄弟
- No.
- That was some good shit, man.

156
00:10:56,284 --> 00:10:58,276
很棒的格斗
Great fight.

157
00:11:12,978 --> 00:11:16,367
衛路的店，這個禮拜是兩萬六千，上個禮拜是二十六

158
00:11:16,847 --> 00:11:20,040
侯進每個禮拜是正好一萬五千

159
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,390
他在博易街的店

160
00:11:23,112 --> 00:11:26,256
中國城，紐約，一年後

161
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:26,481
五月份在丟錢，但是七月八月份他就賺回來了

162
00:11:27,515 --> 00:11:31,851
邵成，上個禮拜是42，這個禮拜是42.5

163
00:11:31,894 --> 00:11:35,032
每個月盈利增長7%

164
00:11:35,097 --> 00:11:39,628
莫特區整個盈利總共上升了72535

165
00:11:40,661 --> 00:11:43,436
我們從梁先生那裡拿了5%

166
00:11:43,507 --> 00:11:47,158
他們都每個禮拜盈利6千到8千

167
00:11:48,002 --> 00:11:50,078
賭場呢？
The casino?

168
00:11:50,173 --> 00:11:53,576
上個禮拜是八十萬，這個禮拜也是八十萬

169
00:11:56,094 --> 00:11:58,335
80萬整？
Exactly 800,000?

170
00:11:58,513 --> 00:12:00,505
大約80萬
It's almost 800.

171
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,517
我不是問你是不是大概80萬
I'm not asking you if it's almost 800.

172
00:12:06,687 --> 00:12:08,680
我要准確數字
I want the exact number.

173
00:12:09,524 --> 00:12:12,893
78萬5370美元
$785,370.

174
00:12:16,322 --> 00:12:19,608
- 再上一周呢？
- 在虧錢
- And the week before?
- It's losing money.

175
00:12:36,647 --> 00:12:37,208
停！

176
00:12:39,054 --> 00:12:41,524
不要打了，拜托，不要打了

177
00:12:53,742 --> 00:12:59,022
今晚，你們會有一個新的場上工頭

178
00:12:59,106 --> 00:13:03,297
如果錢又少了，那就不知道誰會走！

179
00:13:08,943 --> 00:13:09,842
今天晚上他請

180
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,130
肯定不是我請

181
00:13:11,705 --> 00:13:13,231
肯定你啊，這麼多錢

182
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,007
他贏了這麼多錢

183
00:13:18,342 --> 00:13:19,885
- 怎麼？
- 為什麼？
- What?
- Why?

184
00:13:21,554 --> 00:13:24,471
因為他損害了生意，生意是件很嚴肅的事情
Because he was hurting business,
and business is a serious matter.

185
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,218
我懂生意
I understand business.

186
00:13:26,392 --> 00:13:29,476
但是既然要殺他，為什麼還要打他？
But why beat him
if you were going to kill him anyway?

187
00:13:32,109 --> 00:13:37,888
看來你還是不懂這個生意，不說了

188
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:41,252
吃你的飯吧

189
00:13:48,081 --> 00:13:50,073
靠，靠！
Fuck you. Fuck you!

190
00:13:55,171 --> 00:13:57,744
- 你不能進來
- 我只想要些吃的！
- You can't come in the shelter.
- Just trying to get something to eat!

191
00:14:00,593 --> 00:14:04,460
趕緊睡覺！5分鍾後熄燈
Wrap it up. Lights out in five.

192
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,883
趕緊睡覺
Wrap it up.

193
00:14:08,851 --> 00:14:09,847
快點
Come on, guys.

194
00:14:20,363 --> 00:14:22,355
好鞋子
Nice kicks.

195
00:14:25,368 --> 00:14:29,697
最好早上它們還在，不然你就得用耳朵穿上它們了
They'd better be here in the morning
or you'll be wearing them on your ears,

196
00:14:29,872 --> 00:14:33,039
因為我會把你的腳給扭下來
'cause I'll chew yourfeet off
at the goddamn ankles.

197
00:14:45,888 --> 00:14:50,384
我真的想要雙新點的鞋子，我會為你做任何事情
I could really use some new shoes, man.
I'll do whatever you want, you know?

198
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:54,012
任何能幫你熬過晚上的事情
Whatever gets you through the night.

199
00:14:55,022 --> 00:14:57,810
- 我不能...
- 閉嘴，閉嘴！
- I just... I can't take another...
- Shut up. Shut up.

200
00:15:00,153 --> 00:15:02,478
閉嘴，拿走吧，我還有舊鞋子
Shut up and take them.
I've still got my old ones.

201
00:15:04,866 --> 00:15:06,574
好好照顧你的腳
Go and get those feet looked at.

202
00:15:08,494 --> 00:15:10,072
都爛掉了
Gangrene's setting in.

203
00:15:10,246 --> 00:15:13,117
我會的，謝謝你，朋友
I will. Thank you, man.

204
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:17,835
上帝保佑你，兄弟，上帝保佑你
Jesus loves you, brother.
Jesus loves you.

205
00:15:25,136 --> 00:15:28,006
熄燈了，明早七點會叫醒你們的
Lights out. Wake-up call's 7am.

206
00:15:28,181 --> 00:15:30,173
熄燈
Lights out.

207
00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:33,009
熄燈
Lights out.

208
00:15:50,203 --> 00:15:51,780
噓
Shh.

209
00:15:51,954 --> 00:15:54,624
梅，我有個壞消息
Mei, I have sad news.

210
00:15:56,042 --> 00:16:00,371
我聽到他們在談論…你媽媽走了
I heard them talking and...
your mother is gone.

211
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:05,047
她兩周前在醫院去世了
She died two weeks ago in the hospital.

212
00:16:05,843 --> 00:16:07,635
他們不會告訴你的
They werert going to tell you,

213
00:16:07,804 --> 00:16:10,804
但是我告訴你，這樣子你可以為她的靈魂祈禱
but I'm telling you
so that you can pray

214
00:16:10,973 --> 00:16:13,096
讓她找到去天堂的路
for her soul to find its way to heaven.

215
00:16:13,935 --> 00:16:16,556
別告訴他們，如果他們發現我告訴你…
Please don't say anything.
If they find out I told you...

216
00:16:16,729 --> 00:16:19,766
我會保密的，謝謝
I won't say anything. Thank you

217
00:16:23,194 --> 00:16:27,523
所有人起床！9點前離開這裡
Everybody up.
Shelter needs to be cleared by 9am.

218
00:16:27,698 --> 00:16:31,566
在3：30前辦好今晚的床鋪預定
Bed reservations for tonight
need to be made by 3:30.

219
00:16:31,744 --> 00:16:34,366
帶走所有個人物品
Please remove
all your personal belongings.

220
00:16:35,331 --> 00:16:37,703
所有人起床！走了！
Everybody up. Come on, let's go.

221
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,247
帶好個人物品，你們知道規矩的
Take your belongings with you.
You know the drill.

222
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:09,686
那麼，告訴我們發生了什麼
So you wanna tell us what happened?

223
00:17:09,866 --> 00:17:11,823
有人喜歡那鞋子
Someone liked his shoes.

224
00:17:11,993 --> 00:17:14,531
搞笑的家伙！你認為這是個玩笑？
Funny guy. You think this is a joke?

225
00:17:14,704 --> 00:17:17,325
你們知道的，你們這幫保安有多糟糕
You know, you guys
are a hell of a crack security squad.

226
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,948
你做的很對，你本來可以說些什麼的
You were right here.
You could have said something.

227
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:23,246
但是你喝醉酒忙著睡覺，是不是？
But you were too busy
sleeping off this contraband, right?

228
00:17:23,671 --> 00:17:25,664
你如果再來這個避難所
Come into this shelter again

229
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,960
我就把你踹到大街上去
and I'm gonna run your raggedy ass
back out into the street.

230
00:17:54,317 --> 00:18:00,365
梅，到你房間去記住這些數字

231
00:18:00,437 --> 00:18:01,903
我已經記住了

232
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,038
這些數字很重要

233
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:11,001
為了你媽，你要認真一點，知道嗎？

234
00:18:11,118 --> 00:18:13,816
你真的記住了？

235
00:18:14,005 --> 00:18:17,897
我可以給你重復一遍，但是又長又無聊

236
00:18:22,826 --> 00:18:26,750
你看，還沒到一年呢，她已經自信的很了

237
00:18:28,757 --> 00:18:33,627
如果，她說她可以背出密碼，她就能背出

238
00:18:33,741 --> 00:18:35,682
我保證

239
00:18:36,964 --> 00:18:37,590
好了好了

240
00:18:38,497 --> 00:18:41,969
我們要交給你一個很重要的工作

241
00:18:53,636 --> 00:18:55,794
嘿！走路不看路的？
Hey! Watch where you're going, man.

242
00:18:55,972 --> 00:18:58,807
要不要給你點顏色瞧瞧？
You could get your ass
kicked for that, OK? Huh?

243
00:19:08,276 --> 00:19:10,268
4塊5毛5
4.55.

244
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,531
你沒錢就得出去
If you got no money,
you gotta get out of line.

245
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,692
我有錢
I got money.

246
00:19:18,578 --> 00:19:20,701
他沒有錢，看看他那樣子
He doesn't have any money.
Look at him.

247
00:19:20,872 --> 00:19:24,371
先生，我告訴過你，如果你沒錢，你得離開，懂嗎？
Mister, I told you, if you don't
have money, you have to leave, OK?

248
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:26,665
讓開，還有人在等呢
You gotta get out of line.
People are waiting.

249
00:19:27,754 --> 00:19:29,912
走開，兄弟，讓開
Come on, buddy. You gotta go.

250
00:19:47,065 --> 00:19:49,223
- 這家伙惹麻煩了嗎？
- 他瘋了，長官
- This guy giving you trouble?
- He's crazy, Officer.

251
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,974
- 把他帶出去，好嗎？
- 好的，過來，我們走
- Get him out of here, OK?
- All right, come on, let's go.

252
00:19:52,153 --> 00:19:55,604
嘿，你！過來，我們走！出去！到街上去！
Hey, you, come on. Let's go.
Out. On the street.

253
00:19:55,782 --> 00:19:58,403
哥們，如果你想當小丑，去馬戲團
Let's go, funny boy. You wanna be
a clown, go join the circus.

254
00:19:58,576 --> 00:20:01,577
別在我轄區鬧事，聽懂了嗎？
我不想在這附近再見到你，嘿！
Not in my precinct, you hear me?
I don't wanna see you around here. Hey.

255
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,541
上帝啊
Jesus Christ.

256
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:09,200
看看我抓到了誰
Look what the cat dragged in.

257
00:20:15,426 --> 00:20:17,466
不可思議
Unbelievable.

258
00:20:17,637 --> 00:20:20,721
- 看著他
- 看著他？
- Look at him.
- Look at him?

259
00:20:20,848 --> 00:20:22,841
不去聞聞？
How about the smell?

260
00:20:23,726 --> 00:20:25,719
我打電話叫大家過來
Think I'll call the boys.

261
00:20:25,906 --> 00:20:29,577
梅，這是你的指令

262
00:20:29,765 --> 00:20:35,416
張會帶你見一個人，那個人會給你一個新的數字

263
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,814
記住那個數字

264
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:44,056
然後呢張會帶你去一個地方，你會得到最後的指令

265
00:20:50,044 --> 00:20:52,037
想我們嗎，伙計？
You miss us, partner?

266
00:20:53,047 --> 00:20:54,791
歡迎回來
Welcome back to the force.

267
00:20:57,218 --> 00:20:58,297
梅…
Mei...

268
00:20:58,483 --> 00:21:00,232
你學的很快

269
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:04,675
如果干的好，你會跟著韓叔前途無量

270
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:18,522
對不起，我不能讓他們抓到你
I'm sorry. I can't let them have you.

271
00:21:20,283 --> 00:21:23,153
梅！回來這裡！
Mei! Get back here!

272
00:21:37,091 --> 00:21:41,800
- 日子過的怎麼樣，路克？
- 悲劇，不過正在變好
- How's your day been, Luke?
- Started lousy. But it's looking up.

273
00:21:44,974 --> 00:21:49,268
路克•萊特，以前紐約最佳警察
Luke Wright, the Big Apple's hardest cop
once upon a time.

274
00:21:49,437 --> 00:21:52,307
什麼都敢試，但你知道你真正的才能嗎？
You always could take a shot.
But you know what your real talent is?

275
00:21:52,482 --> 00:21:55,151
你是個牽線人！我是說，誰會想到
You're a uniter. I mean, who'd
have thought that us and the Russkies

276
00:21:55,318 --> 00:21:57,394
我們會和俄國佬拴在一起？
would ever be on the same page
about anything?

277
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:00,690
不是我！很高興見到你，混蛋！
Not me. Nice to see you, rat.

278
00:22:00,865 --> 00:22:05,029
自從你出賣我們，我就一直想這麼做了
Been wanting to do this ever since the
day you opened your big fucking mouth!

279
00:22:08,206 --> 00:22:12,155
當我們聽說德切斯基如何對付你時，我笑慘了
When we heard what Docheski did to you,
I mean, I had to laugh.

280
00:22:12,335 --> 00:22:14,292
對於安妮我們很抱歉
I mean, we felt bad for Annie ar all.

281
00:22:14,462 --> 00:22:16,751
她知道她和誰在一起
Them's the breaks.
She knew who she was with.

282
00:22:16,923 --> 00:22:19,046
街上有流言說你回來的時候
Word come up from the street
you were back,

283
00:22:19,217 --> 00:22:20,759
我們甚至不敢相信
we couldn't believe our fucking ears.

284
00:22:20,927 --> 00:22:25,007
你為什麼回來？為什麼不遠走高飛？
Why would you come back? Why wouldn't
you disappear somewhere far way, huh?

285
00:22:25,181 --> 00:22:26,759
比如說月球
Like the moon.

286
00:22:26,933 --> 00:22:29,388
我想家了
I missed home.

287
00:22:32,271 --> 00:22:36,684
你曾是我們一員，路克，我們曾是一個團隊，一個家庭
You were one of us, Luke.
We were a team. We were family.

288
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:40,063
- 然後你扔下了我們
- 我們曾經有多風光，混蛋
- Then you threw us under the bus.
- We were kings, you son of a bitch!

289
00:22:41,197 --> 00:22:43,024
現在，我們只是一群可憐蟲
Now we're bunch of goddamn serfs.

290
00:22:46,577 --> 00:22:48,784
嘿，嘿，冷靜，伯努瓦
Hey, hey, easy, Benoit, huh?

291
00:22:53,251 --> 00:22:55,576
當你回來的時候，我們以為你想尋死
When you came back,
we figured you wanted to die.

292
00:22:55,753 --> 00:22:59,169
我們還開了個盤口賭你怎麼死，你知道的
We got a pool going on when
you're gonna end it and how, you know,

293
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,084
公交，火車…
bus, train...

294
00:23:02,427 --> 00:23:04,633
我賭“找警察自殺”
I got my money on suicide by cop.

295
00:23:06,556 --> 00:23:08,595
來吧，拿好了
Come on, take it.

296
00:23:08,766 --> 00:23:11,720
來一槍，來吧
Take a shot. Come on.

297
00:23:11,894 --> 00:23:14,017
安妮在等著你
Annie's waiting for you.

298
00:23:14,188 --> 00:23:17,391
問題是，你真的認為她想再見到你嗎
Question is, do you really think
she wants to see you again?

299
00:23:17,567 --> 00:23:18,812
嗯？
Hmm?

300
00:23:18,985 --> 00:23:23,362
其實我真正的才能是讓別人輸錢
Actually, my real talent
is costing other people money.

301
00:23:25,533 --> 00:23:27,609
你早就應該知道的，拉斯基
You ought to know that, Lesky.

302
00:23:27,785 --> 00:23:32,115
你會輸錢的，除非你朝我背後開槍
You're gonna lose that bet.
Unless you wanna shoot me in the back.

303
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,282
不過對你來說也不是第一次了
Wouldrt be your first time.

304
00:23:36,127 --> 00:23:38,120
你為什麼不了結這一切？
Why don't you just end it?

305
00:23:39,005 --> 00:23:40,796
你在等什麼？
What are you waiting for?

306
00:23:40,965 --> 00:23:42,958
身邊的人死去更多？
More people around you to die?

307
00:23:46,012 --> 00:23:47,423
你到底在等什麼？
What are you waiting for?

308
00:23:48,806 --> 00:23:52,306
最後一次，告訴我那些數字
For the last time,
give me the numbers.

309
00:24:09,494 --> 00:24:12,364
你是個勇敢的女孩，而且很聰明
You're a very brave girl, and clever.

310
00:24:14,624 --> 00:24:19,167
但你知道我們如何知道你的本事嗎？
But do you know how we knew exactly
what you can do,

311
00:24:19,337 --> 00:24:21,376
你要在什麼時間去什麼地方
where you're going to be and when?

312
00:24:21,547 --> 00:24:24,038
- 有人告訴你了
- 對
- Someone told you.
- That's right.

313
00:24:25,051 --> 00:24:27,376
猜猜是誰？
Can you guess who?

314
00:24:34,977 --> 00:24:38,678
你的朋友，告訴你關於你可憐母親事情的人
Yourfriend, the one who told you
about your poor mother

315
00:24:38,856 --> 00:24:40,648
將你從家裡帶走的流氓可不會告訴你那些
when the scum
who took you from home would not.

316
00:24:40,817 --> 00:24:43,652
她在幫我們做事
She's working for us with a smile.

317
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,563
玲
Ling.

318
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:54,008
梅，我跟他們講他們想知道的事情
他們給了我一把一把的錢

319
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:59,400
沒事，你要是這麼做他們也會幫助你的

320
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:00,806
你真是個笨女人

321
00:25:01,546 --> 00:25:03,040
講英語
In English.

322
00:25:03,242 --> 00:25:04,122
你不知道生意

323
00:25:04,326 --> 00:25:06,745
你給了他們想要的東西，現在他們要殺了你

324
00:25:07,468 --> 00:25:09,876
我說了，講英語！
I said speak in English.

325
00:25:10,847 --> 00:25:12,839
怎麼樣？
Well?

326
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:17,478
她不肯告訴我任何事
She won't tell me anything.

327
00:25:19,856 --> 00:25:21,564
我的父親很有耐心
My father is a patient man.

328
00:25:22,734 --> 00:25:24,014
我沒有
I am not.

329
00:25:25,361 --> 00:25:26,736
告訴他他想知道的一切
Tell him what he wants to know.

330
00:25:26,904 --> 00:25:28,280
不然我就…
Or I'II...

331
00:25:28,448 --> 00:25:30,606
紐約警察！開門！
NYPD! Open the door!

332
00:25:30,783 --> 00:25:32,575
- 搞什麼？
- 我們是警察
- What the hell?
- This is the police.

333
00:25:32,744 --> 00:25:36,243
我們接到報警說擾民
We got reports of a disturbance.

334
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:41,701
你可以選擇配合或者硬來
Look, you can make this easy
or you can make it hard.

335
00:25:41,878 --> 00:25:44,451
開門，不然我們就要砸門了
Open the door or we come in by force.

336
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,626
放屁
Bullshit, blue.

337
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:49,084
你敢進來就別想活著出去，我以母親之名發誓
You come in here, you go out feet first,
I swear on my mother.

338
00:25:53,055 --> 00:25:54,598
他們在裡面，隊長
Yeah, they're in there, Captain.

339
00:25:54,766 --> 00:25:59,309
他們一點都不配合，你最好在事情失控前過來
They're not cooperating. You better
get down here before things go to hell.

340
00:25:59,479 --> 00:26:01,637
不行，這事鬧大了
Negative, negative. This is big.

341
00:26:01,814 --> 00:26:04,815
我馬上回警局指揮，我們再聯系
I'm going back to the station to monitor
the city. I'll get back to you.

342
00:26:05,943 --> 00:26:08,102
好了，我們找到她了，你知道我想要什麼
All right, we got 'em pinned down.
You know what I want.

343
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:14,115
我們有言在先，抓到女孩，可以就活捉，不行就干掉
We have a deal. Get the girl,
alive if you can, dead if you can't.

344
00:26:14,285 --> 00:26:17,120
我們進去的話，布魯克林上升10%，這是新的約定
We go in, Brooklyrs take
goes up by 10%. That's the new deal.

345
00:26:17,288 --> 00:26:19,613
等等，我有個電話要接
Hold on, I got an incoming call.

346
00:26:21,709 --> 00:26:24,876
- 嘿，埃米爾，怎麼了？
- 把你的人弄走，混蛋
- Emile, what's up?
- Take your men off, Wolf.

347
00:26:25,088 --> 00:26:29,880
不管中國人給你什麼，我都加5%
Whatever the Chinese offered to you,
I'll up it by 5%.

348
00:26:34,013 --> 00:26:35,804
把她帶回來
Get her back here.

349
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:47,557
好了，關
All right, Quan,

350
00:26:47,735 --> 00:26:50,487
俄羅斯人提供我布魯克林7%
I got the Russians
offering to up Brooklyrs take by 7%,

351
00:26:50,655 --> 00:26:52,813
布朗克斯也一樣，所以我不知道該怎麼和你說
Bronx the same.
So I don't know what to tell you.

352
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:55,113
我的手下，他們寧願去打仗
My guys are willing
to go to war over this.

353
00:26:55,243 --> 00:26:57,650
卡在我們和俄國人之間
You're gonna be stuck between us
and the Russians like Hitler,

354
00:26:57,829 --> 00:27:01,198
就像希特勒雙線作戰，所以你要想清楚
fighting on two fronts,
so you better think hard about this one.

355
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:04,959
10%，兩個區域，最終提案
10%, both precincts, final offer.

356
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,716
嘿，麥克，這兩幫家伙都願意
Hey, Mac. Both these bastards
are willing to pay a stiff price

357
00:27:18,891 --> 00:27:20,516
為這小姑娘出大價錢
for this little Chink girl.

358
00:27:20,685 --> 00:27:23,686
- 不管她有什麼，我想要
- 那我們的計劃是？
- Whatever she's got, I want it.
- So what's our play?

359
00:27:23,855 --> 00:27:26,310
我讓俄國人放下武器，你們進去
I get the Russians
to drop their guard, you go in.

360
00:27:26,482 --> 00:27:28,938
如果她中槍了
She catches a bullet,
I want you to take out every last one

361
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,646
你給我把布爾什維克的都干掉
of those Bolshevik scumbags.

362
00:27:31,904 --> 00:27:34,230
好的，埃米爾，你的提議不錯
All right, Emile, your offer's good.

363
00:27:34,407 --> 00:27:37,657
我會讓我的人撤走的，只因為我更喜歡你！
I'm gonna call my guys off,
but only 'cause I like you better.

364
00:27:37,827 --> 00:27:41,326
狗屁！你是個貪婪的混蛋，沃夫
Bullshit. You're a greedy bastard, Wolf.

365
00:27:41,497 --> 00:27:45,875
你的嗅覺很靈敏，你想把一切占為己有
You got the scent of something big
and now you want it all for yourself.

366
00:27:46,043 --> 00:27:49,958
不過我想在你派手下進來前告訴你些事情
But I have to tell you something before
you send your men in guns blazing.

367
00:27:51,007 --> 00:27:53,498
- 她不見了
- 你指什麼，她不見了？
- She's gone.
- What do you mean, she's gone?

368
00:27:54,844 --> 00:27:59,221
她逃走了，你的人堵在外面我沒法追她
I mean she escaped, and with
all your men out there, I can't follow.

369
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,632
我提議在找到她之前我們停戰
I offeryou a truce until we find her.

370
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:04,300
我發誓，如果中國人先找到她
Trust me, the Chinese find her first,

371
00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:07,563
你會為此後悔一輩子的
that will be a thing you regret
as long as you live.

372
00:28:08,566 --> 00:28:11,900
德切斯基，她到底知道些什麼？
Docheski, what does she have?

373
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,691
我們說定了嗎，沃夫隊長？
Do we have a truce, Captain Wolf?

374
00:28:17,283 --> 00:28:19,856
女孩是中國人，11歲
The girl is Chinese, 11 years old.

375
00:28:20,036 --> 00:28:22,194
會說普通話和英語
She speaks Mandarin and English.

376
00:28:23,748 --> 00:28:25,325
照片已經下發
A photo is being disseminated.

377
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,916
找到她後直接帶她去中心大街
You are to find her
and bring her straight to Centre Street.

378
00:28:33,716 --> 00:28:34,961
她在往地鐵去
She's heading for subway.

379
00:28:41,157 --> 00:28:43,248
警察跟我們干上了

380
00:28:44,302 --> 00:28:45,032
是嗎？

381
00:28:45,219 --> 00:28:46,245
你沒有辦法？

382
00:28:46,723 --> 00:28:52,132
你這個不動腦筋的笨蛋,如果你讓警察

383
00:28:52,325 --> 00:28:58,093
或俄國人先找到那個女孩,我就砍了你人頭

384
00:29:06,732 --> 00:29:08,432
我們開打吧

385
00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:39,022
對不起，安妮
Sorry, Annie.

386
00:31:46,409 --> 00:31:49,078
俄國人的手機信號在J大街消失了
Lost my lock
on the Russian cell on Jay Street.

387
00:31:49,871 --> 00:31:53,703
聽起來他們是進了地鐵站
Sounds like they went into
the subway station. Manattan bound.

388
00:32:37,794 --> 00:32:38,789
嘿
Hey.

389
00:33:43,526 --> 00:33:46,646
你？那個清潔工？
You? The garbage collector?

390
00:33:46,821 --> 00:33:49,063
你們的情報太糟糕了
You've got bad information.

391
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,241
我從來不收垃圾
我只丟垃圾
I never collected garbage.
I disposed of it.

392
00:33:56,789 --> 00:34:00,205
別被嚇得失眠了，他應得的
Don't lose sleep. He had it coming.

393
00:34:38,623 --> 00:34:39,619
你還好嗎？
Are you all right?

394
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,952
- 出去！出去！
- 快
- Get out! Get out!
- Move.

395
00:34:45,129 --> 00:34:47,122
沒事了
It's OK.

396
00:35:02,814 --> 00:35:06,183
最後目擊到女孩進了J大街地鐵站，紅色警報
Girl was last seen entering
Jay Street Station. Red alert.

397
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:09,443
一旦找到，立刻帶她到中央大街的沃夫隊長這
Once found, she needs to be brought
to Captain Wolf at Centre Street.

398
00:35:09,612 --> 00:35:10,987
重復，紅色警報
Repeat, red alert.

399
00:35:21,207 --> 00:35:24,706
嘿，孩子，我們是警察
Whoa. Easy. Easy there, hon.
We're the police.

400
00:35:24,877 --> 00:35:26,704
好了沒事了
Everything's all right.

401
00:35:26,879 --> 00:35:28,872
你叫什麼？孩子
Hey, what's your name, hon?

402
00:35:29,757 --> 00:35:30,753
就是她
This is her.

403
00:35:30,925 --> 00:35:32,752
我不知道，對我來說他們看起來都一樣
I don't know. They all look alike to me.

404
00:35:32,927 --> 00:35:34,635
- 你有那照片嗎？
- 有，讓我看看…
- You got that picture up?
- Yeah, let me see.

405
00:35:43,396 --> 00:35:45,305
該死的紐約
Fucking New York City.

406
00:35:45,481 --> 00:35:47,474
好久沒見到某些人的話
Don't see somebody for years.

407
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:50,141
你一天會遇到他們兩次
Then you bump into them twice
in the same day.

408
00:35:52,405 --> 00:35:55,572
我不會傷害你的，孩子
Hey, hey, hey. I'm not gonna hurt you.

409
00:36:03,374 --> 00:36:05,663
你到底做了什麼，孩子？
What the hell did you do, kid?

410
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,765
這些追你的都是壞人
You know, those men chasing you are bad.

411
00:36:24,937 --> 00:36:27,345
你能告訴我他們為什麼追你嗎
You wanna tell me why they're after you?

412
00:36:27,523 --> 00:36:29,516
你懂我在說什麼嗎？
You understand me?

413
00:36:30,777 --> 00:36:32,769
你會說英語嗎？
Speak English?

414
00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:40,131
什姆亞金和其他人消失了是什麼意思？

415
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,937
有人把她帶走了

416
00:36:42,506 --> 00:36:45,240
不是警察，他還差點干掉幾個警察

417
00:36:46,242 --> 00:36:48,785
也不是中國人，我不知道他到底是誰

418
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:55,460
干掉他，活捉女孩，不行就全干掉

419
00:37:15,988 --> 00:37:18,859
走另一邊！都是車！
The other way! Cars go the other way!

420
00:37:29,377 --> 00:37:30,456
你瘋了嗎？
Are you a crazy man?

421
00:37:57,989 --> 00:37:59,981
坐穩了
Hold on.

422
00:38:06,622 --> 00:38:09,659
這樣下去,很多無辜的人會受傷
If this goes on, a lot of
innocent people are gonna get hurt.

423
00:38:09,834 --> 00:38:11,412
你希望那樣子嗎?
You want that?

424
00:38:12,795 --> 00:38:14,373
很好！那就按我說的做
Good. Then do what I say.

425
00:38:52,835 --> 00:38:54,875
你還好嗎？
You OK?

426
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:58,548
我們走
Let's go.

427
00:38:58,716 --> 00:39:00,709
我不是5歲小孩
I'm not five years old.

428
00:39:03,846 --> 00:39:05,673
那就跟上
Then keep up

429
00:39:25,118 --> 00:39:28,783
- 你們找到後又跟丟了？
- 不，隊長，我們沒有跟丟她
- You had her and you lost her.
- No, Captain, we didn't lose her.

430
00:39:28,955 --> 00:39:30,235
她被搶走了
She was taken by force.

431
00:39:30,415 --> 00:39:33,499
- 俄國人？
- 不是俄國人
- The Russians?
- No, not the Russians.

432
00:39:34,293 --> 00:39:35,918
好吧…
Well...

433
00:39:36,087 --> 00:39:38,079
- 是路克•萊特
- 什麼？
- It was Luke Wright.
- What?

434
00:39:38,256 --> 00:39:40,794
- 沃夫隊長
- 等會，大衛
- Captain Wolf?
- Not now, David.

435
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:42,959
市長想找你，隊長
The mayor wants you, Captain.

436
00:39:44,178 --> 00:39:46,669
- 把他接到2線
- 不是電話
- Put him through on two.
- He's not on the phone.

437
00:39:47,348 --> 00:39:49,305
他想讓你去大廈…昨天
He wants you at the mansion, yesterday.

438
00:39:51,144 --> 00:39:53,136
給您
There you go.

439
00:39:55,815 --> 00:39:58,306
- 謝謝，伊萬諾夫先生
- 謝謝
- Thank you, Mr Ivanov.
- Thank you.

440
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:11,574
伊萬諾夫先生？給您，伊萬諾夫先生，1012號房間
Mr Ivanov?
Here you are, Mr Ivanov. Room 1012.

441
00:40:11,748 --> 00:40:14,036
- 10樓
- 謝謝
- Tenth Floor.
- Thank you.

442
00:40:32,935 --> 00:40:35,426
你喜歡高檔酒店？
You like a nice hotel.

443
00:40:35,605 --> 00:40:37,597
我從來沒住過高檔酒店
I've never stayed in a nice hotel.

444
00:40:38,566 --> 00:40:40,642
所以沒人會到這種地方找我們
No one's gonna look for us in one.

445
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:44,232
她一定在這裡，不過我看不清楚

446
00:40:44,367 --> 00:40:46,630
干擾太多

447
00:40:46,865 --> 00:40:48,151
等一下

448
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:49,576
等一下！

449
00:40:51,172 --> 00:40:52,732
我找到她了

450
00:40:57,752 --> 00:40:59,744
多想現在洗個澡啊
Would I love a shower right now.

451
00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:02,664
你可以洗的
You could use one.

452
00:41:07,136 --> 00:41:10,173
我大可以讓俄國人把你帶下列車
I could have just let those Russians
grab you on the train.

453
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:15,475
那你為什麼要救我？
Why did you save me?

454
00:41:18,231 --> 00:41:21,267
我沒救你…是你救了我
I didn't save you. You saved me.

455
00:41:22,402 --> 00:41:24,394
我只是作為回報
I'm paying you back.

456
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:27,072
我叫路克
My name's Luke.

457
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:30,613
梅
Mei.

458
00:41:34,038 --> 00:41:36,031
你有父母嗎，梅？
You have parents, Mei?

459
00:41:37,667 --> 00:41:40,288
- 我有父親
- 他叫什麼?
- I have a father.
- What's his name?

460
00:41:40,461 --> 00:41:42,454
張關
Chang Quan.

461
00:41:44,465 --> 00:41:46,458
張關？
Chang Quan?

462
00:41:47,051 --> 00:41:49,756
如果我們是在說同一個人的話
If we're talking about the same guy,

463
00:41:49,929 --> 00:41:52,420
據我所知他根本沒孩子
he didn't have any kids
last time I checked.

464
00:41:52,598 --> 00:41:54,757
這沒道理，他不可能有像你那麼大的孩子
Any made since
wouldn't be a day over three years old.

465
00:41:55,685 --> 00:41:57,345
我是領養的
I'm adopted.

466
00:41:58,062 --> 00:42:00,055
他從老家帶你來這的？
He bring you overfrom back home?

467
00:42:05,778 --> 00:42:07,818
張不像是個做父親的人
Chang isn't the fatherly type.

468
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,904
你為什麼來這，梅？
Why are you here, Mei?

469
00:42:11,325 --> 00:42:13,318
做會計
To count.

470
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:22,165
你是被張的老板，那個老家伙送來的？他叫什麼？
You were sent over by the old guy,
Chang's boss. What's his name?

471
00:42:22,336 --> 00:42:25,788
沒有電腦，沒有電子資料
Old school.
No computers, no electronic trails.

472
00:42:25,965 --> 00:42:28,041
只有你腦子裡的東西，是嗎？
Just what you have
in your head, right?

473
00:42:40,271 --> 00:42:42,762
- 你知道韓礁嗎？
- 我知道他
- You know Jiao Han?
- I know of him.

474
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:47,066
他告訴了我一個數字，非常長的一個數字
He told me a number,
a very long number.

475
00:42:47,195 --> 00:42:50,694
我本來要去個地方拿下個數字和指示
I was going someplace where I would get
another number and more instructions,

476
00:42:50,865 --> 00:42:53,154
但是俄國人現身殺了所有人
but the Russian came and shot everyone.

477
00:42:53,326 --> 00:42:55,733
之後警察又出現了，我就逃走了
Then the police came and I ran away.

478
00:42:55,912 --> 00:42:58,616
現在你知道一切了，高興了嗎？
Now you know everything.
Happiness for you?

479
00:43:02,251 --> 00:43:04,125
想回去找韓礁嗎？
You wanna go back to Han Jiao?

480
00:43:05,505 --> 00:43:08,541
我造成了太多麻煩
生意搞砸了
I make too much trouble. Bad business.

481
00:43:08,716 --> 00:43:11,587
事成之後，他會殺掉我，真是如意算盤
After I do what he asks, he kills me.
Good business.

482
00:43:11,761 --> 00:43:13,919
那麼，這組數字是什麼？
So what about this number?

483
00:43:14,097 --> 00:43:17,181
一個又長又無聊的數字，我可以告訴你
It's a long, boring number.
I can tell it to you.

484
00:43:18,101 --> 00:43:20,473
對我來說毫無意義
It wouldn't mean anything to me.

485
00:43:20,645 --> 00:43:23,218
你怎麼知道是一個數字而非一堆獨立數字呢？
How do you know it's one number
and not a bunch of separate numbers?

486
00:43:26,359 --> 00:43:30,107
你是個瘋子，但是倒不蠢
You're a crazy man but not so stupid.

487
00:43:31,114 --> 00:43:34,114
這些數字對你來說有何特別嗎？
Is there anything interesting to you
about these numbers?

488
00:43:34,242 --> 00:43:37,326
- 或許有點
- 為什麼？
- Maybe a few of them.
- Why?

489
00:43:37,495 --> 00:43:40,449
因為他們都是3或者7開頭
Because they have a three or a seven
before them.

490
00:43:40,623 --> 00:43:42,331
所有數字都是隨機的
All the numbers are random,

491
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,747
但當中5個是7開頭的，8個是3開頭的
but five of them has a seven before
and eight of them has a three before.

492
00:43:46,921 --> 00:43:49,412
對於隨機數來說這頻率太高
That's too many times to be random.

493
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:51,916
這是個密碼
It's a code.

494
00:43:52,135 --> 00:43:54,839
- 還有呢？
- 沒了
- What else?
- Nothing.

495
00:43:56,264 --> 00:43:58,055
那麼，這些3和7是比較有用的
So the three and the seven
are interesting

496
00:43:58,224 --> 00:44:00,632
因為他們隨機出現了太多次？
because they happen too many times
to be random.

497
00:44:01,477 --> 00:44:04,597
因為它們不是數字，是單詞
Because they're not numbers.
They're words.

498
00:44:04,772 --> 00:44:07,144
從左到右或者從右到左
Right left or left right.

499
00:44:07,316 --> 00:44:10,520
老手法了，保險箱的密碼
Old school. Combination to a safe.

500
00:44:21,873 --> 00:44:22,987
在這個酒店裡？
In the hotel?

501
00:44:23,166 --> 00:44:24,790
哪？
Where?

502
00:44:24,992 --> 00:44:26,847
我能查到的就是這些了

503
00:44:33,071 --> 00:44:33,950
怎麼樣?

504
00:44:34,387 --> 00:44:37,483
我們現在在找一個男的，他和一個女孩在一起

505
00:44:37,635 --> 00:44:41,654
他有武器，非常危險，警察局的人說他是…

506
00:44:42,706 --> 00:44:45,178
大概5尺11寸，褐色頭發，30歲左右
About five eleven, brown hair, 30s.

507
00:44:45,313 --> 00:44:47,471
大概幾小時前來的
Probably came in here
less than a few hours ago.

508
00:44:47,648 --> 00:44:49,558
先生，我們不允許透露顧客信息
Sir, we're not allowed
to discuss our guests.

509
00:44:49,734 --> 00:44:52,023
那麼，他確實是客人了？他入住了嗎？
So he's a guest? Did he check in?

510
00:44:52,195 --> 00:44:53,903
對不起，先生，我們不能…
I'm sorry, sir.
We're not at liberty to...

511
00:44:54,072 --> 00:44:56,609
他和一個中國女孩在一起，11歲
He would have been with a Chinese girl,
11 years old.

512
00:44:56,783 --> 00:44:59,618
我是她的父親，我很擔心她
I'm herfather
and I'm very worried about her.

513
00:44:59,786 --> 00:45:03,368
真抱歉，我可以幫你報警
I'm so sorry.
I can call the police for you.

514
00:45:04,082 --> 00:45:05,825
你敢報警我殺了你
Do that and I blow your brains out.

515
00:45:07,043 --> 00:45:08,039
- 現在…
- 別動
- Now...
- Don't move.

516
00:45:08,211 --> 00:45:09,491
他在哪個房間？
...what room is he in?

517
00:45:10,338 --> 00:45:12,580
哪個房間？
What room is he in?

518
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:18,676
我想…他是在10樓
I think maybe
I put him on the 10th floor.

519
00:45:18,846 --> 00:45:20,839
哪個房間？
Room.

520
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,841
我發誓，他沒有帶著一個小女孩
I swear he didn't have
a little girl with him.

521
00:45:24,018 --> 00:45:26,639
- 房間
- 我需要查一下
- Room.
- I just need to check.

522
00:45:26,813 --> 00:45:29,849
那就快查，或者我給你一槍
Then check quick
or I put a bullet in your brain.

523
00:45:30,024 --> 00:45:32,017
- 快
- 把手舉起來
- Quick.
- Put your hands up.

524
00:45:34,237 --> 00:45:37,238
- 你不會想這麼做的
- 把手舉高讓我看見
- You don't want any part of this.
- Hands up so I can see 'em.

525
00:45:52,422 --> 00:45:54,379
沒人可以離開這酒店
No one leaves the hotel!

526
00:45:54,549 --> 00:45:56,126
快點！
Come on!

527
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,673
1012，他在1012房
1012. He's in room 1012.

528
00:45:58,845 --> 00:46:01,632
我以為你說沒人會到這裡找我們
I thought you said
no one would look for us here.

529
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,549
我把它關掉了，沒人能打進來
I turned it off
so no one could call when I was...

530
00:46:04,725 --> 00:46:06,054
它不需要被開著
It doesn't need to be on.

531
00:46:07,645 --> 00:46:09,554
- 回去！
- 等等！
- Get back!
- Wait!

532
00:46:09,731 --> 00:46:11,308
都給我趴在地上！
Get down on the floor.

533
00:46:16,571 --> 00:46:17,899
所有人回去！
Everybody back!

534
00:46:18,072 --> 00:46:19,103
寫下那些數字
Write down the numbers,

535
00:46:19,282 --> 00:46:21,987
那些3和7開頭的，快！
just the ones with the three
and the seven in front of 'em, quick.

536
00:46:23,327 --> 00:46:26,163
你！過來這裡！趴下！趴下！
You, get over there! Get down! Get down!

537
00:46:29,667 --> 00:46:31,161
我會想辦法帶你去安全的地方
I'll try to get you someplace safe.

538
00:46:31,335 --> 00:46:33,577
如果我們分開了，別說你跟我說過什麼！
We get separated,
don't tell them you told me anything.

539
00:46:33,755 --> 00:46:37,289
- 梅，如果他們試圖嚇唬你…
- 試圖？我已經被嚇到了！
- Mei, if they try to scare you...
- Try? I'm so scared already.

540
00:46:37,467 --> 00:46:39,009
嗯，我也是，記住，撒謊！
Yeah, me to. Remember, lie.

541
00:46:39,177 --> 00:46:40,422
我們快到了
We're almost there.

542
00:46:40,595 --> 00:46:42,837
如果你們看到他們下樓，小心別殺了那個女孩
If you see them downstairs,
try not to kill the girl.

543
00:46:51,064 --> 00:46:53,471
進去
Back inside.

544
00:46:58,196 --> 00:47:00,900
跟上他們！我下樓去斷他們退路！
Follow them!
I'm going back down to cut them off.

545
00:47:38,152 --> 00:47:40,608
警察來了，頂住他們直到我下令撤退！
The cops are here.
Hold them off until I give the word.

546
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,440
別讓他們進來
Do not let them in!

547
00:48:10,977 --> 00:48:13,682
所有人給我趴下，你們走不了了
Everybody stay down!
You ain't going nowhere! Stay!

548
00:48:13,855 --> 00:48:16,772
嘿！你去哪？回去！站住！蹲下！都回去！
Hey, where you going?
Get down! No! Get back down!

549
00:48:16,941 --> 00:48:19,693
- 回去！
- 快！快！
- Get back!
- Move! Move!

550
00:49:15,833 --> 00:49:17,742
起來！所有人起來！
Get up! Everybody up!

551
00:49:17,919 --> 00:49:20,789
我們要離開酒店了，起來！
We're getting out of the hotel. Up!

552
00:49:20,963 --> 00:49:23,881
站起來，不然我就開槍了！站起來！
Up or I start shooting you! Up!

553
00:49:26,177 --> 00:49:28,798
58號轉角，我們發現嫌疑犯
Moving to corner of 58.
We got a suspect.

554
00:49:28,971 --> 00:49:31,213
別動！
Hey, don't move!

555
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:33,383
別動！
Don't move!

556
00:49:40,483 --> 00:49:43,056
走！往那走！
Move! Move! Over there! Go!

557
00:49:43,236 --> 00:49:48,147
到街上去，別停！誰不聽話下場就是這樣！
Into the street and keep moving!
Anyone who doesn't dies like this!

558
00:49:50,827 --> 00:49:51,906
到街上去
Into the street!

559
00:49:54,414 --> 00:49:56,869
重復，別開槍！
Repeat, hold your fire!

560
00:49:57,667 --> 00:49:58,865
那些都是平民！
They're civilians!

561
00:50:12,348 --> 00:50:16,346
嫌犯在人群中，嫌犯在人群中
Suspect is in the crowd.
Suspect is in the crowd.

562
00:50:22,275 --> 00:50:23,686
嘿！給我站住！
Hey, stop right there!

563
00:50:53,264 --> 00:50:56,016
嘿，你干什麼！
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

564
00:50:59,562 --> 00:51:02,848
我的車！做點什麼！他搶了我的車！
That's my car!
Do something, he took my fucking car!

565
00:51:16,829 --> 00:51:18,822
往市中心開，我過一會告訴你地址
Head downtown.
I'll give you an address in a minute.

566
00:51:36,265 --> 00:51:38,258
靠
Shit.

567
00:51:45,441 --> 00:51:48,442
- 嘿，朋友！可以告訴我地址了嗎？
- 等一下
- Hey, buddy, you wanna give me address?
- In a minute. Just hold on.

568
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:05,232
誰？

569
00:52:05,465 --> 00:52:10,132
你以為是誰？我是皮特,你電話裡沒我號碼嗎？

570
00:52:10,291 --> 00:52:13,832
皮特？警察說在地鐵裡發現你跟...

571
00:52:14,129 --> 00:52:17,232
警方報告有誤

572
00:52:17,387 --> 00:52:19,063
其他人被...

573
00:52:19,715 --> 00:52:21,532
什麼聲音？

574
00:52:22,391 --> 00:52:24,732
抱歉，信號不好

575
00:52:24,804 --> 00:52:26,732
我拿到數字了

576
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,232
什麼？

577
00:52:28,299 --> 00:52:32,232
在她被劫走前，我們從她那拿到數字了

578
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:36,232
我跟條子玩了幾個小時的捉迷藏

579
00:52:36,334 --> 00:52:39,479
伊哥，把數字記到手機裡

580
00:52:40,059 --> 00:52:41,736
說吧，告訴我數字

581
00:52:41,736 --> 00:52:46,732
你瘋了嗎？數字在一公裡外一張紙上，你在哪？

582
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:48,032
他可能帶警察來了

583
00:52:48,151 --> 00:52:51,732
我們要清場嗎？

584
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:54,732
如果有警察，我們最好避開人群

585
00:52:54,827 --> 00:52:56,812
而且需要有利地形

586
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:00,696
好的，皮特...

587
00:53:01,472 --> 00:53:04,232
現在給你個機會做英雄

588
00:53:04,315 --> 00:53:05,432
曼夢西卡見

589
00:53:05,505 --> 00:53:06,932
快來

590
00:53:07,314 --> 00:53:08,982
我馬上到

591
00:53:08,941 --> 00:53:12,986
他回來了？路克•萊特回到我的城市了？
He's here? Luke Wright is back
in the city, in my city?

592
00:53:13,154 --> 00:53:14,862
他已經回來有一段時間了
He's been back for a while.

593
00:53:15,031 --> 00:53:17,189
- 一段時間？多久？
- 可能一年，這很難說
- A while? What's a while?
- Maybe a year. It's hard to say.

594
00:53:17,366 --> 00:53:19,406
掛掉電話！
Turn that goddamn thing off.

595
00:53:20,787 --> 00:53:22,863
- 亞歷克斯
- 朋友們
- Alex.
- Guys.

596
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:25,031
是，對不起，市長
Yes, sir. Sorry, Your Honour.

597
00:53:27,251 --> 00:53:29,742
發生了什麼，沃夫？路克•萊特又是怎麼卷進來的？
What's going on, Wolf?
And how's Luke Wright involved in it?

598
00:53:29,921 --> 00:53:31,997
我本來也想問你這個問題
I figured I might ask you
the same question.

599
00:53:32,173 --> 00:53:34,166
別和我玩游戲
Don't try to game me.

600
00:53:35,259 --> 00:53:36,718
你不過就是個馬前卒
You're nothing but a pawn

601
00:53:36,844 --> 00:53:39,216
下著一盤你無法掌控的大棋
playing on a board so big
you can't even see the edge.

602
00:53:39,388 --> 00:53:41,262
僅此而已
That's all you've ever been.

603
00:53:41,432 --> 00:53:44,801
直到5分鍾前我都比你更了解路克•萊特
I knew about Luke Wright, which is more
than you can say until five minutes ago.

604
00:53:46,396 --> 00:53:47,771
你所知的路克•萊特
What you know about Luke Wright

605
00:53:47,939 --> 00:53:51,105
還不到浩瀚資料中的一小片段
rates less than a paragraph
in a very fat book.

606
00:53:52,026 --> 00:53:53,022
世貿大廈倒下後
After the towers fell

607
00:53:53,194 --> 00:53:56,148
我們的人都分散出去追尋恐怖活動
and our manpower was spread out
tracking terrorist activity,

608
00:53:56,322 --> 00:53:58,113
是我組織了特勤隊
I was the one
who formed the special task force

609
00:53:58,282 --> 00:54:00,074
懲治犯罪以填補缺口
to deal with the crime
that was filling the gap.

610
00:54:00,243 --> 00:54:03,659
別忘了也是我讓你來管理這支隊伍
And don't you ever fucking forget that
I was the one who put you in charge.

611
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:06,321
我從來沒忘記…我的工作成就了你的市長
I didn't forget. My work made you mayor.

612
00:54:06,499 --> 00:54:08,159
你的工作？
Your work?

613
00:54:08,334 --> 00:54:11,086
你以為路克只是你警察中的一員？
You think Luke
was just one of your cops?

614
00:54:11,254 --> 00:54:13,542
當我拉起隊伍時，我知道它需要一面刀鋒
When I put together your team,
I knew it needed an edge

615
00:54:13,756 --> 00:54:17,291
普通警探無法勝任，得像手術刀刀鋒一般
no ordinary detectives could give me,
something surgical.

616
00:54:18,219 --> 00:54:21,802
我拜托那些甚至不存在於官方記錄中的朋友
I called friends in places buried
so deep they don't officially exist.

617
00:54:21,973 --> 00:54:26,635
他們很同情我，一周後他們送來了路克•萊特
They were sympathetic.
A week later they sent Luke Wright.

618
00:54:27,395 --> 00:54:29,637
那些過去七年裡消失的自作聰明的家伙
Those wise guys who vanished
over the last seven years,

619
00:54:29,814 --> 00:54:31,807
你以為他們死於自相殘殺？
you think that was internecine war?

620
00:54:32,775 --> 00:54:35,064
你在哈林區排水溝裡找到的可卡因
Those coke kings
you found in the gutter in Harlem.

621
00:54:35,236 --> 00:54:38,687
布魯克林的弗雷迪•彼得羅維奇，中國城的湯米•勞
Freddy Petrovich in Brooklyn.
Tommy Lau in Chinatown.

622
00:54:38,865 --> 00:54:40,573
路克•萊特是個幽靈
Luke Wright is a ghost.

623
00:54:41,701 --> 00:54:43,693
非常致命的幽靈
A very deadly ghost.

624
00:54:45,496 --> 00:54:47,489
而且工作很效率
It worked like a charm too.

625
00:54:48,332 --> 00:54:51,915
然後你們這幫混蛋就忙著撈錢了
Then you dicks had to get greedy
and pad your pockets.

626
00:54:52,086 --> 00:54:55,502
路克是個殺手，但是個誠實的殺手
Luke's a killer, but he's an honest one.

627
00:54:55,673 --> 00:54:58,164
當他威脅說要把向情報局告發一切時
When he threatened to take
the whole thing to IA,

628
00:54:58,342 --> 00:55:00,964
當時確實費了很大的勁
it took some people with a lot of bronze
stuck to their pyjamas

629
00:55:01,137 --> 00:55:02,335
才搞定他
to talk him off the ledge.

630
00:55:02,513 --> 00:55:05,218
如果我的隊伍解散，我們就又變回苦力了
Yeah, my team gets dismantled.
We're peons again.

631
00:55:05,391 --> 00:55:06,802
但是如果路克•萊特有這麼深背景
But if Luke Wright's so connected,

632
00:55:06,934 --> 00:55:09,686
為什麼他會淪落到在澤西打拳擊
how does he wind up in Jersey
cage fighting on the B circuit?

633
00:55:10,813 --> 00:55:12,972
我看起來像心理醫生嗎？
Do I look like a shrink?

634
00:55:13,149 --> 00:55:15,355
動員起所有人來
Get everybody on this.

635
00:55:15,526 --> 00:55:17,186
一旦路克•萊特有了目標
Once Luke Wright gets on a roll,

636
00:55:17,361 --> 00:55:19,354
整個城市只有一個人能在
一對一中和他抗衡
only one man in this city
can take him on one-on-one.

637
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:20,645
打擾了,我知道我不該打擾你們
I know this is a closed door,

638
00:55:20,823 --> 00:55:24,738
但是市中心一座酒店發生了大規模槍戰
but there was just a major gun battle
downtown at a hotel.

639
00:55:24,911 --> 00:55:27,828
媒體都瘋了,您需要趕緊做一份聲明
Media's going nuts.
You're gonna need to make a statement.

640
00:55:29,415 --> 00:55:31,622
韓礁現在也在城裡
Han Jiao is in the city also.

641
00:55:31,834 --> 00:55:35,168
他給了那個中國女孩一些東西,我不知道的東西
He give this little Chinese girl
something, I don't know what.

642
00:55:35,338 --> 00:55:36,962
路克•萊特在我之前帶走了她
Luke Wright grabbed her before I could.

643
00:55:37,131 --> 00:55:38,329
- 什麼？
- 我說路克•萊特
- What?
- I said Luke Wright...

644
00:55:38,508 --> 00:55:41,046
知道了，我一開始就聽到了
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I heard you the first time.

645
00:55:45,181 --> 00:55:46,675
關閉曼哈頓的每一個出口
Close every exit out of Manattan.

646
00:55:46,849 --> 00:55:50,384
確保萊特和那個女孩逃不出去
Make sure that neither Wright or the
girl gets away, you get commissioner.

647
00:55:50,561 --> 00:55:54,891
放跑了...你就找把鏟子自掘墳墓吧
Let 'em go... you get a shovel
to dig your own grave.

648
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:58,772
那個女孩絕不能離開這個城市
That girl does not leave this city.

649
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:07,419
誰殺了那個俄國人?

650
00:56:08,333 --> 00:56:10,259
我不知道,他沒有告訴我

651
00:56:11,462 --> 00:56:13,387
他有沒有問到那個數字？

652
00:56:14,388 --> 00:56:16,098
每個人都問那個數字

653
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:24,127
那你跟他們講些什麼呢？

654
00:56:28,231 --> 00:56:29,654
我什麼都沒說

655
00:56:30,818 --> 00:56:31,895
什麼？

656
00:56:33,998 --> 00:56:35,701
我什麼都沒說

657
00:56:37,868 --> 00:56:39,455
你在撒謊！！！

658
00:56:39,565 --> 00:56:41,123
韓叔叔我當然不會給你撒謊的

659
00:56:41,292 --> 00:56:46,024
打個電話告訴他們把阿梅的媽媽干掉

660
00:56:46,212 --> 00:56:50,090
因為她的女兒是騙子

661
00:56:50,265 --> 00:56:53,792
韓叔叔，我發誓，我假裝不會說英文也聽不懂

662
00:56:53,923 --> 00:56:58,536
他們又吼又叫的但是我什麼都沒說，因為我知道你會生氣的

663
00:56:58,708 --> 00:57:00,205
我向我媽發誓

664
00:57:08,389 --> 00:57:11,343
我們找到了女孩，但是信息可能已經被洩漏
We recovered the girl, but the
information might have been compromised.

665
00:57:11,517 --> 00:57:14,008
- 我們要改下時間表嗎？
- 不可能
- Should we change our time frame?
- lmpossible.

666
00:57:14,187 --> 00:57:16,345
現在整件事情已經失控了
Now that the whole damn thing
has gone supernova,

667
00:57:16,522 --> 00:57:18,729
今晚一定要了結此事
it's going to happen
and it's gonna happen tonight.

668
00:57:18,941 --> 00:57:20,484
會面地點要改下
But the meeting place
needs to be changed.

669
00:57:20,651 --> 00:57:23,225
- 到哪？
- 我會告訴你的
- Where to?
- I'll let you know.

670
00:57:23,404 --> 00:57:25,397
這裡！就這裡！
Here. Right here.

671
00:57:30,953 --> 00:57:34,120
慢點，停車
Slow down. Stop the car.

672
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:37,624
不行，不行，別把妓女帶上我的車子
No, no, you don't bring
no hookers in my cab, man.

673
00:57:38,878 --> 00:57:40,871
繼續打你的表
Just keep the meter running.

674
00:57:44,884 --> 00:57:47,090
小姐們
Ladies.

675
00:57:47,261 --> 00:57:49,254
去喝一杯如何？
How about a drink?

676
00:57:56,813 --> 00:57:58,805
晚上好
Good evening.

677
00:57:58,981 --> 00:58:00,808
- 晚上好
- 想在這裡吃晚餐嗎？
- Evening.
- Will you be joining us for dinner?

678
00:58:00,983 --> 00:58:03,557
- 我們沒有預定
- 沒事的
- We don't have a reservation.
- That's OK.

679
00:58:03,736 --> 00:58:07,520
今晚雖然很忙，但是我們應該能給你們找到位置
We're busy tonight, but we should
be able to find you something.

680
00:58:09,075 --> 00:58:12,574
樓下已經沒有空位了，不過背後還有些
We don't have any tables downstairs,
but there are some in the back.

681
00:58:13,746 --> 00:58:16,237
或者如果你們喜歡的話，去樓上也可以
Or you could sit upstairs if you like.

682
00:58:23,047 --> 00:58:27,376
先生？您怎麼看？先生？
Sir? Sir?
Do you have a preference? Sir?

683
00:58:27,552 --> 00:58:29,094
我們就在吧台喝點酒
I think we'll just get a drink
at the bar.

684
00:58:32,932 --> 00:58:35,138
你親我一下然後轉身出去
I want you to give me a kiss,
turn round and walk out of here.

685
00:58:35,309 --> 00:58:38,014
- 但是我以為
- 就像你忘記了什麼東西一樣
- But I thought...
- Just act like you forgot something.

686
00:58:38,146 --> 00:58:39,556
只是不要再回來了
Only don't come back.

687
00:58:51,951 --> 00:58:55,450
來杯白俄羅斯，還有把叉子
Give me a white Russian, please,
and a fork.

688
00:58:55,621 --> 00:58:58,029
- 叉子？
- 就那樣的
- Fork?
- One of those.

689
00:59:00,817 --> 00:59:04,273
我從來不知這種時候該說什麼

690
00:59:06,859 --> 00:59:08,875
什麼時候？

691
00:59:09,041 --> 00:59:11,482
在我殺人之前

692
00:59:35,203 --> 00:59:37,610
他開的什麼車？停在哪？
What does he drive
and where is it parked?

693
00:59:40,333 --> 00:59:42,575
外面小路上的一輛銀色的SUV
A silver SUV in the alley outside.

694
00:59:57,266 --> 00:59:59,936
- 瓦西裡
- 打錯了
- Vassily.
- Not even close.

695
01:00:01,437 --> 01:00:02,433
你是誰？
Who is this?

696
01:00:02,605 --> 01:00:04,728
整晚都在屠戮你手下的人，埃米爾
The guy who's been
killing your boys all night, Emile.

697
01:00:04,899 --> 01:00:08,019
你的兒子在我手裡
The guy who has your son tied up
in a very dark place.

698
01:00:08,986 --> 01:00:09,982
聽好，我想要…
Now, here's what I want.

699
01:00:10,154 --> 01:00:11,779
你以為我會關心你想要什麼？
You think I give a shit
of what you want?

700
01:00:11,948 --> 01:00:14,273
你以為抓了瓦西裡就能敲詐我？
Do you think you can blackmail me
because you have Vassily?

701
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:17,155
- 殺了他，下地獄去吧
- 我會下地獄的
- Kill him and go to hell.
- I'm going to hell all right.

702
01:00:17,328 --> 01:00:19,653
不過我不會殺了你兒子
But I'm not gonna kill your boy.

703
01:00:19,831 --> 01:00:22,322
我會把他帶在身邊，就像寵物一樣
I'm gonna keep him around, like a pet.

704
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,169
我對待寵物可不友善
A very badly treated pet.

705
01:00:25,336 --> 01:00:27,245
我會做一些讓我以後每次照鏡子
I'm gonna do things to him
that'll make me ashamed

706
01:00:27,422 --> 01:00:30,541
都覺得屈辱的事情，但是我會這麼做的
to look in the mirror afterward,
but I will do them.

707
01:00:31,259 --> 01:00:34,710
瓦西裡會告訴我所有他所知道的
Vassily's gonna tell me everything
he knows about your operation.

708
01:00:34,887 --> 01:00:37,557
然後你准備怎麼做？報警？
And then what you gonna do?
Tell the police?

709
01:00:38,599 --> 01:00:42,051
- 你在搞笑嗎？
- 我之前有提到過警察嗎？
- You want me to laugh?
- Who said anything about the police?

710
01:00:42,228 --> 01:00:44,386
我會把這些信息與你的競爭對手分享
I'm gonna share the information
with the competition,

711
01:00:44,564 --> 01:00:46,224
我還沒干掉的那些家伙
the ones I haven't already killed.

712
01:00:46,399 --> 01:00:48,854
我會拿光你所有的東西
Anything they don't take from you,
I will.

713
01:00:49,026 --> 01:00:52,312
首先我會帶走你漂亮的老婆
First I'm gonna take your trophy wife.

714
01:00:52,488 --> 01:00:55,442
然後是你的孩子們
Then I'm gonna take
your trophy children.

715
01:00:55,616 --> 01:00:57,159
我會讓你一無所有
I'm gonna leave you with nothing.

716
01:00:57,285 --> 01:00:59,776
當我完事後，你就什麼都不是了
When I'm done, you won't even be
a memory of a memory.

717
01:01:00,997 --> 01:01:04,366
- 不過這些都沒必要發生
- 你想要什麼？
- But that doesn't have to happen.
- What do you want?

718
01:01:05,334 --> 01:01:07,576
- 我想知道保險箱裡有什麼
- 什麼保險箱？
- I wanna know what's in the safe.
- What safe?

719
01:01:07,754 --> 01:01:10,873
那個女孩給我密碼的那個保險箱
The safe the girl gave me
the combination to. That safe.

720
01:01:13,176 --> 01:01:15,168
三千萬美元
$30 million.

721
01:01:16,846 --> 01:01:19,717
那孩子本來要去拿第二個密碼，第二個保險箱裡有什麼？
Kid was on her way to get a second
number. What's in the second safe?

722
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:24,385
值三千萬美元的東西
Something won'th $30 million.

723
01:01:24,562 --> 01:01:26,887
- 給誰？
- 不知道
- To who?
- No idea.

724
01:01:28,274 --> 01:01:30,730
那是因為你只有小聰明，埃米爾
That's 'cause
you're only half-smart, Emile.

725
01:01:32,904 --> 01:01:34,647
那麼，我們這麼說定了…
So here's the deal.

726
01:01:34,822 --> 01:01:37,527
你告訴我第一個保險箱在哪，我拿了錢就放你兒子
You tell me where the first safe is,
I take the money and let your boy go.

727
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:40,452
騙我的話你就死定了，說到做到
Lie to me and yourworld ends.
You have my word on that.

728
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:44,664
白癡！我知道一個人是否獨行
Idiot. I know
when a man is working alone

729
01:01:44,832 --> 01:01:47,288
而你正好只身一人
and you're as alone as one can be.

730
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:50,377
你需要一支隊伍才能靠近保險箱
You need a small army
to get near that safe,

731
01:01:50,546 --> 01:01:52,705
我有這種隊伍
the kind of army I have.

732
01:01:52,882 --> 01:01:56,832
曾經有過！我時間不多
Had. It's been shrinking by the minute.

733
01:01:58,096 --> 01:02:00,883
最後一次機會，否則我就掛電話修理你兒子了
Last chance before I hang up
and go to work on your son.

734
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,512
你要殺我嗎，收垃圾的？
Going to kill me, garbage man?

735
01:02:09,107 --> 01:02:12,392
你那天就可以把我們都干掉的，是嗎？
You could have taken us out that day,
couldn't you?

736
01:02:12,568 --> 01:02:14,691
但是你只是跪在那裡
But you just sat there,

737
01:02:14,862 --> 01:02:17,567
讓我們毀掉你，讓你變得一無是處
let us ruin you,
let us make you nothing.

738
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:21,868
我猜是保險箱給了你新的動力，是嗎，收垃圾的？
I guess finding out about that safe gave
you new motivation, eh garbage man?

739
01:02:23,079 --> 01:02:25,486
如果我是你就不會浪費口舌
I wouldn't spend my time talking
if I were you.

740
01:02:26,249 --> 01:02:30,578
會祈禱事情結束時，那小女孩還活著
Spend it praying that when this is over
that little girl's still alive.

741
01:02:34,424 --> 01:02:36,416
祈禱！
Pray.

742
01:02:44,684 --> 01:02:45,680
時間地點？
When and where?

743
01:02:45,852 --> 01:02:48,936
橋下的地下道，一小時後
The underpass under the bridge,
one hour.

744
01:02:52,734 --> 01:02:56,648
對不起，那些俄國人出現時我用槍指著你
I'm sorry I pointed a gun at you
when the Russians attacked us, Mei.

745
01:02:58,072 --> 01:03:00,029
- 那只是…
- 生意而已…我知道的
- It was...
- Business. I know.

746
01:03:00,199 --> 01:03:02,607
很好，很好，你理解
It's good. It's good you understand.

747
01:03:02,785 --> 01:03:04,861
我們會搞定這一切
We're going to get this done

748
01:03:05,037 --> 01:03:07,279
然後你跟我和韓叔一起就安全了
and you'll be safe
with me and Uncle Han.

749
01:03:09,083 --> 01:03:10,625
我保證做一個好父親
I promise to be a better father to you

750
01:03:10,793 --> 01:03:12,952
比那個拋棄你和你母親的家伙更好
than the one
who left you and your mother.

751
01:03:16,716 --> 01:03:19,385
這個世界上沒人比我更關心你
There's no one in the world
who cares more about you.

752
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,926
你知道的，是嗎？
You know that, don't you?

753
01:03:52,335 --> 01:03:54,624
人都到了
Well, the gang's all here.

754
01:03:54,796 --> 01:03:56,587
差不多
Almost.

755
01:03:56,756 --> 01:04:00,006
- 伯尼生病了？
- 他在醫院，混蛋！
- Reddick have to call in sick?
- He's in the hospital, dickhead.

756
01:04:00,176 --> 01:04:03,877
- 你打壞了他的氣管
- 我從來不知道氣管還能被打壞
- You broke his trachea.
- I didn't know a trachea could break.

757
01:04:04,055 --> 01:04:06,012
- 希望他們能修好
- 是嗎！不如讓我先修理你？
- Hope they can fix it.
- Yeah? How about I fix you?

758
01:04:06,182 --> 01:04:08,755
嘿！嘿！嘿！嘿！別這樣！
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Not here.

759
01:04:09,894 --> 01:04:13,429
好久不見，路克，不過我並不想念你
It's been a while, Luke.
Can't say I missed you.

760
01:04:14,941 --> 01:04:18,773
- 那麼，有話直說吧
- 帶了我要的東西沒？
- So, let's get down to business.
- Did you bring what I asked for?

761
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:25,441
- 托斯卡尼的
- 還有呢？
- Toscanni's.
- Where else?

762
01:04:42,385 --> 01:04:44,792
味道不錯！
Mmm. That's good.

763
01:04:59,235 --> 01:05:01,228
我整晚都在餐館裡
Been in restaurants all night.

764
01:05:02,321 --> 01:05:04,314
但是他們提供給我的都是子彈
All I got served was lead.

765
01:05:10,621 --> 01:05:13,575
- 有火嗎？
- 去你的！
- Anyone got a light?
- You know what? Screw this.

766
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:16,205
聽著，隊長，你讓我們過來，我們過來了
Look, Captain, you asked us
to come here, so we came.

767
01:05:16,419 --> 01:05:19,040
但我不會站在這裡聽這混蛋胡扯
But I ain't gonna sit here
and listen to this scumbag's big mouth.

768
01:05:19,213 --> 01:05:21,206
閉嘴，科夫克斯！
Shut up, Kolfax.

769
01:05:21,799 --> 01:05:24,337
還沒戒煙，哈？
Still haven't quit, huh?

770
01:05:34,812 --> 01:05:37,434
嘿，嘿，這是什麼？
Hey. Hey, what the hell is that?

771
01:05:37,607 --> 01:05:39,599
裝有三千萬美元保險箱的密碼
Combination of the safe
with 30 million bucks in it.

772
01:05:39,776 --> 01:05:42,267
- 哇，哇！你在干嘛？
- 你個狗屎
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Filthy piece of shit.

773
01:05:42,445 --> 01:05:45,362
現在這密碼存在我腦子裡了
The only place it exists now is in here.

774
01:05:45,531 --> 01:05:48,069
當你們手癢想扣扳機時，記住這點
Remember that next time
your little triggerfinger gets itchy.

775
01:05:48,242 --> 01:05:49,487
為什麼韓礁會把它藏在
Why would Han Jiou stash it

776
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:52,234
中國城最繁忙的賭窩裡？
right in the middle of Chinatowrs
busiest gambling den?

777
01:05:52,455 --> 01:05:54,613
因為伯努瓦這樣的喜歡
Because of sleaze-bucket cops
like you, Benoit,

778
01:05:54,791 --> 01:05:57,329
去賭窩收保護費腐敗警察
who collect off of Chinatowrs
busiest gambling den.

779
01:05:57,502 --> 01:05:59,909
想不吸引警察的注意
Where else would he surround it
with dozens of armed man

780
01:06:00,088 --> 01:06:01,665
他還能放在哪裡？
without attracting police attention?

781
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:05,291
隊長,我們怎麼知道這混蛋不是在玩我們？他是個流浪漢！
Captain, why do we know this son of
a bitch on the level, huh? He's a bum.

782
01:06:05,468 --> 01:06:07,461
你從哪得到的消息？
Where'd you get your information?

783
01:06:08,387 --> 01:06:10,464
今晚會有個交易
There's an exchange happening tonight.

784
01:06:10,598 --> 01:06:12,756
三合會半數交易額都在賭場保險箱裡
The Triad half of the deal
is in a safe in the casino.

785
01:06:12,934 --> 01:06:16,599
我一人搞不定，所以我叫了你們，老朋友們
No way I could get to it on my own,
so I called on you, my old pals.

786
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:20,471
三千萬美元分六份依然是很大一筆錢
30 million split six ways
is still a lot of money.

787
01:06:23,277 --> 01:06:27,192
我們風險太大，隊長，尤其是你
We're risking a lot, Captain.
You especially.

788
01:06:27,365 --> 01:06:29,938
所有人都知道你前途光明
Everybody knows you got a bright future.

789
01:06:30,118 --> 01:06:33,072
誰保證的？你的市長？
Promised by who? His Honour?

790
01:06:33,246 --> 01:06:35,950
他跟你承諾什麼了，沃夫？
What carrot
is he teasing you with, Wolf?

791
01:06:36,124 --> 01:06:38,496
若他知道你所掌握的，他還會放過你？
He's gonna let you out in the street
knowing what you know now?

792
01:06:38,668 --> 01:06:39,830
你什麼意思？
What's that supposed to mean?

793
01:06:40,002 --> 01:06:42,873
意思是，他的第二任期快到頭了，什麼保證都是屁
His second term is gonna come to an end
and his hold on the city goes poof.

794
01:06:43,047 --> 01:06:45,503
就跟普通公民一樣
Just like that he's Joe Citizen again.

795
01:06:45,633 --> 01:06:47,922
三千萬是一筆不錯的退休金
30 million would be
a nice retirement package.

796
01:06:48,094 --> 01:06:49,339
他給中國佬什麼好處？
What's he giving the Chinks?

797
01:06:49,512 --> 01:06:53,379
如果我知道，還會跟你們這幫混蛋站在這裡？
If I knew that, I wouldn't be standing
here with you assholes, would I?

798
01:06:55,101 --> 01:06:56,678
光明未來，哈？
A bright future, huh?

799
01:06:56,853 --> 01:06:58,561
頭條
Big headlines.

800
01:06:58,730 --> 01:07:02,181
“英雄警察破獲紐約最大的地下賭博巢穴”
"Hero cops take down New York City's
biggest underground gambling operation."

801
01:07:02,358 --> 01:07:05,359
每人五百萬美元，且沒人知道
Five million bucks apiece
that no one will ever know about,

802
01:07:05,528 --> 01:07:07,817
就當是額外甜頭
just to give it that extra sweet taste.

803
01:07:25,673 --> 01:07:29,623
好了，誰進去過？拜托，誰進去過？
All right, who's been in there?
For Christ's sake, who's been in there?

804
01:07:29,802 --> 01:07:32,127
- 我，隊長
- 你倆做先鋒
- Me, Cap.
- You two, you're on point.

805
01:07:32,305 --> 01:07:35,092
裡面都是平民，看准了打
Place is packed with civilians,
so exercise some judgement.

806
01:07:35,266 --> 01:07:37,389
記住只有我有密碼
Remember, I got the combination.

807
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:39,802
如果你們想要錢，掩護好我
You want that money, watch my back.

808
01:07:57,163 --> 01:07:59,239
你要去哪？
Where are you going?

809
01:07:59,415 --> 01:08:02,202
別動！待著！
Don't move! Stay!

810
01:08:16,099 --> 01:08:17,474
讓開！走！
Out of the way! Move!

811
01:08:35,159 --> 01:08:36,618
嘿，你，去死吧！
Hey, you, settle down!

812
01:08:48,881 --> 01:08:50,079
這裡！走！
This way. Let's go.

813
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:35,999
小心
Heads up.

814
01:09:44,395 --> 01:09:46,518
走
Go.

815
01:09:57,575 --> 01:09:59,698
科夫克斯，干掉他
Kolfax, take him out.

816
01:10:06,209 --> 01:10:07,917
掩護他
Cover him.

817
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:52,246
打開它，開槍！
Open it. Take it!

818
01:10:54,006 --> 01:10:55,382
靠！
Oh, shit!

819
01:11:15,194 --> 01:11:17,104
靠！我必須離開這裡
Oh, shit.
I gotta get out of here.

820
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:20,234
操，操，隊長
Oh, fuck. Fuck, Captain.

821
01:11:22,702 --> 01:11:26,071
天啊，你個混蛋！你殺了同伴，你個混蛋！
God, you shit!
Shoot a man in the back, son of a bitch!

822
01:11:26,956 --> 01:11:30,076
- 好了，米爾斯，我們往哪走？
- 這裡
- All right, Mears, where we going?
- This way.

823
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,787
快
Move.

824
01:11:34,412 --> 01:11:35,976
我們被襲擊了

825
01:11:36,084 --> 01:11:38,166
他們不是俄國人，好像是警察

826
01:11:38,312 --> 01:11:40,147
不過他們比警察更厲害

827
01:11:40,273 --> 01:11:44,005
派點人來，他們殺了很多人，快點啊，我們需要...

828
01:11:45,170 --> 01:11:51,513
告訴張，盡快拿到那個數字然後把跑腿的干掉

829
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:56,831
這個數字由我們自己來破解

830
01:11:56,950 --> 01:11:57,560
你們聽懂了嗎？

831
01:12:12,502 --> 01:12:15,075
- 天堂之門到了
- 把我們這樣的罪人拒之門外
- The gates of paradise.
- Locked and bolted to sinners like us.

832
01:12:15,254 --> 01:12:18,172
好了，別浪費時間
Yeah, well,
let's not wait for an invitation.

833
01:12:41,114 --> 01:12:43,652
好了，你個混蛋，快點開始
All right, you bastard. Get started.

834
01:12:52,208 --> 01:12:54,331
下面按我說的做
Here's how we do this.

835
01:12:54,502 --> 01:12:57,538
你們先放下槍，我再開保險箱
You put down your guns, I open the safe.

836
01:12:58,881 --> 01:13:01,170
如果你們想殺我，隨意
If you wanna shoot me, go ahead.

837
01:13:01,342 --> 01:13:04,592
快點決定，真警察馬上就要到了
Make your minds up quick
'cause the real cops'll be here soon.

838
01:13:07,432 --> 01:13:09,341
放到地上
On the floor.

839
01:13:43,926 --> 01:13:46,002
快點，你個混蛋，你想干什麼？
Come on, you son of a bitch.
What are you trying to pull?

840
01:13:46,179 --> 01:13:48,930
密碼左右方向反了，馬上就開了
I had right left switched.
It's gonna open.

841
01:14:06,616 --> 01:14:07,778
你會活著的
You'll live.

842
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:12,612
左26
Left 26.

843
01:14:29,013 --> 01:14:30,804
沃夫隊長，這裡發生了什麼？
Captain Wolf,
what the hell happened in here?

844
01:14:30,973 --> 01:14:33,725
你以為發生了什麼，哈？我們突襲了這裡
What do you think happened, huh?
We had a raid on the place go bad.

845
01:14:33,893 --> 01:14:36,051
有人員傷亡，趕緊給我進去處理
We got dead cops, casualties.
Get in there, will you?

846
01:14:36,229 --> 01:14:38,850
- 沃夫隊長，你需要救護車
- 我需要一排救護車
- Captain Wolf, you need an ambulance.
- I need a fleet of ambulances.

847
01:14:39,023 --> 01:14:41,894
趕緊叫救護車，懂嗎？我自己開去醫院
Call it in, will you? I'll take
my own busted ass to the hospital.

848
01:14:45,029 --> 01:14:46,523
演技不錯
Not bad.

849
01:14:46,697 --> 01:14:49,485
如果你不是個兩面派，我幾乎都喜歡上你了
If you werert such a double-dealing
asshole, I could almost like you.

850
01:14:49,659 --> 01:14:52,114
是幾乎！開車！
Almost. Drive.

851
01:14:57,291 --> 01:14:58,916
只是劃傷
It's a scratch.

852
01:15:02,213 --> 01:15:05,997
我不會殺你，但我可沒說讓你住大酒店
I'm not gonna kill you, but I didn't say
I was putting you up at the Ritz.

853
01:15:14,350 --> 01:15:15,844
沃夫
Wolf.

854
01:15:16,018 --> 01:15:18,011
我需要錢，丹尼
I have your money, Danny.

855
01:15:19,772 --> 01:15:20,768
什麼？
What?

856
01:15:22,483 --> 01:15:24,143
你聽見了
You heard me.

857
01:15:24,318 --> 01:15:27,687
三千萬！五千份一千美元的支票
30 million. Five-thousand
and one-thousand dollar bills.

858
01:15:27,864 --> 01:15:29,607
- 我想談談
- 不行
- I wanna talk.
- No.

859
01:15:29,782 --> 01:15:32,190
你需要的是冷靜下來我們好談點正常的
No, what you wanna do is calm down
so we can talk like adults.

860
01:15:32,368 --> 01:15:34,028
閉嘴，丹尼
Shut it, Danny.

861
01:15:34,162 --> 01:15:36,285
我是想談，不過不是和你談
I wanna talk,
but I don't wanna talk to you.

862
01:15:36,456 --> 01:15:37,914
我要和你男朋友談
I wanna talk to your boyfriend.

863
01:15:42,336 --> 01:15:44,044
我是亞歷克斯
This is Alex.

864
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:46,627
好久不見，亞歷克斯
Been a while, Alex.

865
01:15:46,799 --> 01:15:49,207
- 你怎麼拿到這號碼的？
- 別這樣，亞歷克斯
- How'd you get this number?
- Come on, Alex.

866
01:15:49,385 --> 01:15:51,508
順著市長的味就能找到你
Reach up the mayor's ass, there you are.

867
01:15:53,723 --> 01:15:56,130
男人就該有男人樣，哈？
A mars gotta do
what a mars gotta do, huh?

868
01:15:56,309 --> 01:15:58,385
他總比安妮這誘餌好
He's a better catch
than Annie was anyway.

869
01:15:58,561 --> 01:16:01,895
我一直不解你為什麼會勾搭上那樣一頭奶牛
I never understood
how you hooked up with a cow like that.

870
01:16:02,065 --> 01:16:04,734
絕不是因為她的長相，而是她的幽默感
It was never about her looks.
It was her sense of humour.

871
01:16:04,901 --> 01:16:07,107
她現在沒那麼搞笑了，不是麼？
She's not so funny now, is she?

872
01:16:07,278 --> 01:16:09,769
不是了，我也一樣
No, she's not. Neither am I.

873
01:16:11,699 --> 01:16:14,486
我拿到了錢，亞歷克斯，我殺了很多人才弄到的
I have the money, Alex.
I had to kill a lot of people to get it.

874
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:16,071
所以聽著
So listen up.

875
01:16:17,455 --> 01:16:20,705
你還沒交換過密碼，另一個保險箱裡是什麼？
You haven't made the combination
exchange yet. What's in the other safe?

876
01:16:20,875 --> 01:16:23,366
一張碟片
A disc.

877
01:16:23,544 --> 01:16:26,118
名字，錢的來龍去脈…
Names, money trails.

878
01:16:26,297 --> 01:16:29,298
當指揮官派我們幫丹尼清理城市時
When our commanders sent the two of us
to help Danny clean up the city,

879
01:16:29,467 --> 01:16:30,498
他們附加了一個條件
they attached a price.

880
01:16:30,676 --> 01:16:32,219
作為交換，丹尼要自尋財路
In exchange, Danny looked the other way

881
01:16:32,386 --> 01:16:35,340
而每筆被當做恐怖組織查抄的集團資金
while the assets seized from every group
deemed a terrorist organisation

882
01:16:35,515 --> 01:16:37,388
則裝進了他們的私人腰包
were funnelled
into their private accounts.

883
01:16:37,558 --> 01:16:39,136
驚訝是他們受驚需要保護時
Amazing what people
let you get away with

884
01:16:39,310 --> 01:16:41,219
卻把你趕走了
when they're scared
and wanna feel protected.

885
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:43,222
驚訝的是有那麼多小人
Amazing how many scumbags
there are out there

886
01:16:43,398 --> 01:16:44,975
都等著乘機牟利
waiting to take advantage of it.

887
01:16:45,149 --> 01:16:46,774
- 難道你沒有麼？
- 我退出了
- Like you didn't?
- I quit.

888
01:16:46,943 --> 01:16:49,944
你以為這能幫那些被你私自送去見上帝的人
Bet that helps all those souls you sent
to meet their maker without due process

889
01:16:50,113 --> 01:16:51,275
省下很多功夫嗎？
rest a whole lot easier.

890
01:16:51,447 --> 01:16:53,404
你以為你在拳擊場上
You thought you could atone
by climbing into a cage

891
01:16:53,574 --> 01:16:55,650
被人隨意毆打就能贖罪嗎？
and allowing yourself
to get beaten to a pulp?

892
01:16:55,827 --> 01:16:57,570
別給我說教了，路克！
Don't fucking preach at me, Luke.

893
01:16:57,745 --> 01:17:00,497
我只是收錢辦事
I'm getting paid for services rendered.

894
01:17:00,665 --> 01:17:05,125
是啊，你把碟片賣給中國人好讓他們勒索我們上司
Right. You sell the disc to the Chinese
so they can blackmail our old honchos,

895
01:17:05,294 --> 01:17:08,995
然後拿著三千萬美元和丹尼去巴哈馬別墅逍遙自在
take the 30 mill and waltz off
with Danny to a villa in the Bahamas.

896
01:17:09,173 --> 01:17:11,711
是巴厘島，不過無所謂了，不是麼？
Bali, but whatever, right?

897
01:17:11,884 --> 01:17:14,921
那麼，就算你知道了，又如何？
So, now you know. Now what?

898
01:17:15,138 --> 01:17:16,929
現在你要應付我
Now you're dealing with me.

899
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:19,678
- 好吧，我退出
- 不行
- All right, I'm turning around.
- No, you're not.

900
01:17:20,893 --> 01:17:23,515
你說什麼？你已經拿到錢了
What are you talking about?
You've got the money.

901
01:17:23,688 --> 01:17:27,982
- 中國人手裡沒有我要的了
- 不，他們有我想要的
- The Chinese have nothing I care about.
- No. They have something I do.

902
01:17:46,502 --> 01:17:50,167
把你保險箱密碼給這女孩，她會給你我們的
Give the girl the combination to your
safe and she will give you our number.

903
01:17:50,339 --> 01:17:52,166
我們到你的地方，你去我們的
We go to your location, you go to ours.

904
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:55,633
當我們拿到碟片，我們會給你解密密碼
When we've gotten the disc,
we will explain the code

905
01:17:55,803 --> 01:17:57,001
你拿到你的錢
and you'll get the cash.

906
01:17:57,805 --> 01:17:59,798
一言為定
That's the deal.

907
01:18:00,558 --> 01:18:03,678
- 說說看吧
- 這是個很長的數字
- Let's hear it.
- It's a very long number.

908
01:18:03,853 --> 01:18:06,344
你最好能記下來
You'll want to write it down.

909
01:18:06,522 --> 01:18:08,479
感謝上帝我還帶了筆，哈？
Thank goodness I brought a pen, huh?

910
01:18:18,409 --> 01:18:20,069
你最好閉上眼睛
You might wanna close your eyes.

911
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:23,789
隨你便吧
Have it your way.

912
01:18:36,219 --> 01:18:38,211
快接，路克
Come on, Luke.

913
01:18:40,431 --> 01:18:42,839
老地方，就你和我
The old place, just you and me.

914
01:18:45,686 --> 01:18:47,097
你是路克的朋友嗎？
You're a friend of Luke?

915
01:18:49,732 --> 01:18:51,808
這不是你該關心的
Not as far as you're concerned.

916
01:19:03,955 --> 01:19:06,113
今晚席卷整個紐約的暴力活動
The violence
that has rocked the city tonight

917
01:19:06,290 --> 01:19:07,666
依舊持續，不到一小時前
continued in a bloody gun battle

918
01:19:07,834 --> 01:19:10,788
中國城一家夜總會爆發了血腥槍戰
in a Chinatown nightclub
less than an hourago.

919
01:19:10,962 --> 01:19:13,250
- 這已經完全失控了
- 你以為呢？
- This is really getting out of hand.
- You think?

920
01:19:13,381 --> 01:19:15,420
謝謝提醒
Thanks for that insight.

921
01:19:15,591 --> 01:19:18,426
市長，亞歷克斯•羅瑟斯在你私人專線上
Your Honour,
Alex Rosers on your private line.

922
01:19:18,594 --> 01:19:20,089
他說有急事
He says that it's urgent.

923
01:19:20,263 --> 01:19:23,596
- 打擾一下，市長
- 我5分鍾後回來，現在別煩我
- Excuse me, Your Honour.
- Back in five. Don't bother me now.

924
01:19:23,766 --> 01:19:25,973
他為什麼不打我手機？
Why didn't he call me on my cellphone?

925
01:19:26,144 --> 01:19:29,061
我記得讓你把所有電話都接到我的…
I thought I told you to put
all my calls through to the...

926
01:19:30,022 --> 01:19:33,142
我一直跟你說這裡保安水平太差
I always told you this place
had lousy security standards.

927
01:19:35,403 --> 01:19:38,570
那是因為沒人會瘋到像你一樣來這殺人
Because nobody's been crazy enough to
come in here and pull a stunt like this.

928
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:42,524
- 你有種，路克
- 是啊，真是驚訝我還能走路
- You got some balls, Luke.
- Yeah, amazing I can even walk.

929
01:19:42,702 --> 01:19:44,279
給我碟片
The disc.

930
01:19:44,412 --> 01:19:46,737
什麼？你以為我會傻到讓中國幫派
What, you think I'm stupid enough
to let a gang of Chinese

931
01:19:46,914 --> 01:19:49,322
穿過前門進到房間來拿它？
walk up the front steps and collect it
from me in my living room?

932
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:53,165
- 它在離這很遠的保險箱裡
- 我不認為你很蠢
- It's in a safe far away from here.
- I don't think you're stupid.

933
01:19:53,337 --> 01:19:56,422
所以我不認為你只有一份拷貝
Which is why I don't for a second
believe you gave away the only copy.

934
01:19:56,591 --> 01:19:58,797
我會去見亞歷克斯
I'm going to meet Alex.

935
01:19:58,968 --> 01:20:02,419
你先給我碟片，不然我就在非要害的部位給你一槍
First you give me the disc or I'll put
bullets in places that won't kill you

936
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:05,930
讓你下半輩子生不如死
but make you spend
the rest of your life wishing I had.

937
01:20:14,067 --> 01:20:15,644
滿意了?
Satisfied?

938
01:20:15,818 --> 01:20:18,190
我要確認一下這不是“金剛葫蘆娃”
I wanna make sure
it's not ABBA'sGreatest Hits.

939
01:20:28,164 --> 01:20:29,907
亞歷克斯會殺了你的,你知道的
Alex will kill you, you know.

940
01:20:31,209 --> 01:20:33,534
嗯，或許吧
Yeah, probably.

941
01:21:18,423 --> 01:21:21,708
上帝，路克，你氣色很不好
Jesus. Luke, you look like hell.

942
01:21:22,635 --> 01:21:27,297
酒精而已，缺少睡眠和陽光
Just alcohol, lack of sunlight,
sleep deprivation.

943
01:21:28,891 --> 01:21:30,884
除此以外，我感覺不錯
Other than that, I feel great.

944
01:21:32,979 --> 01:21:37,273
呵，我在想，我們在這裡拋過多少屍了？
You know, I was thinking, how many
bodies have we dumped in this place?

945
01:21:39,485 --> 01:21:40,861
你知道的，我從不記數
You know, I didn't keep count.

946
01:21:42,155 --> 01:21:44,396
他們都是混蛋，不是麼？
They were all assholes, though, right?

947
01:21:49,203 --> 01:21:50,235
放開她，亞歷克斯
Let her go, Alex.

948
01:21:51,831 --> 01:21:54,998
丹尼打電話說你去拜訪過他
Danny called.
He told me about your visit.

949
01:21:56,502 --> 01:21:59,622
我不得不承認，我都沒想到這一手
I have to admit,
even I didn't see that one coming.

950
01:22:00,465 --> 01:22:03,501
你現在有了錢和碟片
You had the disc and the money.

951
01:22:03,676 --> 01:22:06,084
什麼...
What...

952
01:22:06,262 --> 01:22:09,014
她對你來說意味著什麼？
What is she to you?

953
01:22:11,642 --> 01:22:12,638
生命
Life.

954
01:22:14,562 --> 01:22:17,978
好吧，趁還有命就好好享受吧
Well, enjoy it while it lasts,

955
01:22:18,149 --> 01:22:20,818
不久她就會讓你的小命玩完的
'cause she's the reason
yours is gonna be a whole lot shorter.

956
01:22:21,903 --> 01:22:23,895
錢在哪，路克
The money, Luke.

957
01:22:25,114 --> 01:22:27,107
在車裡
In the car.

958
01:22:30,036 --> 01:22:31,530
或者銀行裡
Or in the bank.

959
01:22:34,582 --> 01:22:37,155
或者在中央車站儲物櫃裡
Or in a series of lockers
at Grand Central.

960
01:22:37,335 --> 01:22:41,463
或者我可能出於好心悉數捐出了
Or maybe I donated it to charity,
out of the goodness of my heart.

961
01:22:43,549 --> 01:22:46,634
想要知道下落，你就得來硬的
You wanna find out where that money is,
you're gonna have to do it the hard way.

962
01:23:43,568 --> 01:23:45,975
你還好吧，梅？
You all right, Mei?

963
01:23:46,154 --> 01:23:49,605
我見過他打斗，你打不過他的
I saw him fight before.
Bad business for you.

964
01:23:50,366 --> 01:23:52,573
是啊，最糟的是
Yeah. The worst.

965
01:23:54,787 --> 01:23:57,574
你又救了我
You saved me, again.

966
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,577
我們救了對方
We save each other.

967
01:24:05,423 --> 01:24:07,131
我知道你在想什麼
I know how you feel.

968
01:24:08,301 --> 01:24:10,543
幫我把這垃圾弄出來
Help me get this sack of garbage
out of the car.

969
01:24:12,930 --> 01:24:15,256
確保他安全回到他老爸那兒
Make sure he gets to his daddy
safe and sound.

970
01:24:18,686 --> 01:24:21,936
5萬，賠償你的損失
50 grand, for your trouble.

971
01:24:22,106 --> 01:24:24,977
錢可能不多，但至少你有命花
Might not seem like much, but at least
you're gonna live to enjoy it.

972
01:24:25,151 --> 01:24:28,899
在經歷了這麼多後，你還想放過他？
You want him safe and sound
after what he did to you?

973
01:24:31,282 --> 01:24:33,109
為了她
For her sake.

974
01:24:36,913 --> 01:24:38,905
若再見面，你就萬事皆休
We meet again, all bets are off.

975
01:24:41,422 --> 01:24:42,909
最尊敬的叔叔

976
01:24:43,041 --> 01:24:46,663
這裡有兩千九百九十五萬美元

977
01:24:46,773 --> 01:24:51,259
我們會還余下的5萬，再加10%的利息

978
01:24:51,876 --> 01:24:53,858
如果萬一您還生氣

979
01:24:54,028 --> 01:24:59,280
我必須告訴您，我知道您在中國城生意的每一個帳號

980
01:24:59,364 --> 01:25:02,147
還有匯錢到中國的途徑

981
01:25:02,248 --> 01:25:06,690
您不找我們的麻煩，我們也不會找您的麻煩

982
01:25:07,024 --> 01:25:09,811
來追我們的話，你的世界就完了

983
01:25:10,014 --> 01:25:12,209
我保證說話算話

984
01:25:14,905 --> 01:25:16,905
給我准備飛機票

985
01:25:18,152 --> 01:25:20,348
我再也不想看到這個

986
01:25:21,531 --> 01:25:22,741
鬼地方！

987
01:25:27,088 --> 01:25:29,377
- 你媽的給我看路，哥們！
- 走你的
- Watch where you're fucking going, man!
- Keep walking.

988
01:25:29,549 --> 01:25:31,790
- 什麼？再說一遍？啥？
- 走開
- Excuse me? Pardon me? Anything?
- Walk.

989
01:25:31,968 --> 01:25:33,960
這是他媽的紐約！
This is fucking New York City!

990
01:25:45,523 --> 01:25:48,358
- 第五家銀行了，還有幾家？
- 沒了
- Bank number five. How many more?
- That's it.

991
01:25:49,569 --> 01:25:52,486
現在碟片拷貝已遍布城市保險櫃
Got copies of the disc
in security boxes all over the city.

992
01:25:52,655 --> 01:25:53,900
如果我們出事
Anything happens to us,

993
01:25:54,073 --> 01:25:56,232
很多大人物就得倒霉
a lot of important people
are gonna be very sorry.

994
01:25:56,409 --> 01:25:59,279
我們的護身符，這是筆好生意
Our security. Good business for us.

995
01:26:01,664 --> 01:26:04,582
- 現在干嘛？
- 我們離開這裡
- What now?
- Now we get out of town.

996
01:26:06,794 --> 01:26:12,085
梅，你是個孩子…我不確定自己能否做個好父親
Mei, you're a kid and...
I'm not sure I could be a good father.

997
01:26:12,258 --> 01:26:14,001
我想我能力不足
I think that ship has sailed.

998
01:26:14,177 --> 01:26:16,086
我不想要父親
I don't want no more fathers.

999
01:26:18,556 --> 01:26:20,762
你可以做我朋友嗎？
Will you be my friend?

1000
01:26:22,143 --> 01:26:24,136
至死都願
Till my dying day.

1001
01:26:28,691 --> 01:26:32,107
我找到一家在西雅圖專門培訓天才兒童的學校
I got info on a school
for gifted kids up in Seattle.

1002
01:26:33,738 --> 01:26:37,321
這會是次美妙旅行，如果你喜歡那裡的風光的話
It's a nice drive,
if you like trees and shit.

1003
01:26:39,619 --> 01:26:40,615
我們安全了嗎？
Are we safe?

1004
01:26:42,914 --> 01:26:46,413
別想太多，梅，別想太多
One day at a time, Mei.
One day at a time.

1005
01:26:48,791 --> 01:26:54,003
