1
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,081
You're lying to me.

2
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,527
I'm not.
I don't know what you're talking about.

3
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,365
I don't know what you want from me.
I swear I don't.

4
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,124
I have three children.

5
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,170
The first thing you have to learn
as a father is to know

6
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,687
when your children are lying to you.

7
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,604
You're lying to me,
and if you don't stop,

8
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,367
<i>I'm going to use one of those tortures
your people are so famous for </i>

9
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,002
on your little body
until you tell me what I want to know.

10
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,084
For the last time,
give me the numbers.

11
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,129
<i>- Mei!</i>

12
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,969
How dare you come here!
You have no right!

13
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,726
- Ma, enough! Stop!
- You've no right to be here. No right!

14
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,601
You should be in jail!
You should be in jail!

15
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,808
You get out of here!
You get out of here.

16
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,440
- I'm sorry.
- I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

17
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,766
Piece of garbage. The kid
should never been in there with me.

18
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,324
Luke, come on. What, are you crazy, man?

19
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,211
- Get off.
- Get off, now!

20
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,206
I never liked you, Luke.

21
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,250
You're a better fighter than 90%
of the guys you go in the cage with,

22
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,971
but you just let 'em pound on you
like you're a side of beef.

23
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,441
You already lost to every chump
in the circuit.

24
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,523
But last night, of all nights,

25
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,921
you're supposed to go down
in the second, you son of a bitch.

26
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,241
- Once.
- Back off.

27
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,880
I hit him once. Where'd you find him,
the fucking playground?

28
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,929
YouTube, you asshole.

29
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,811
The kid's an internet sensation
until you put him in a coma,

30
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,730
which frankly
I do not give a shit about.

31
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,848
But you cost me a million dollars,

32
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,209
which is nothing
compared what you cost Docheski.

33
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,601
Yeah. You recognise the name?

34
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,047
He was betting on you big time
to take the dive.

35
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,810
And he's gonna take it out on me too

36
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,089
'cause he knows I'm the schmuck
that set this whole thing up.

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,562
Unless I deliver your head
with a down payment.

38
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,851
You know how the Russians are.

39
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,448
Mei.

40
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,284
Mei.

41
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,604
<i>You got the right number,
so leave the right message.</i>

42
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,286
Call me when you get this, Annie.
I mean right away.

43
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,965
If you're out, don't go home.

44
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,088
If I'm scaring you, that's good.
Call me.

45
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,803
Annie?

46
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,883
That's it?

47
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,769
I heard you were
some kind of a tough guy.

48
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,321
No fighting?

49
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,290
You're just going to sit on the floor
like a dog who wants to die?

50
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,323
Sorry it had to be so messy.

51
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,883
The boy is still learning.

52
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,524
And I'm not a doctor,
but I think she was eating for two.

53
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,808
We're like Charlie Manson family, no?

54
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,811
My father was going to send
someone else, but I'm making my bones.

55
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,804
You make your bones by killing someone
who can hurt you back.

56
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,850
And who would that be? You?

57
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,082
Well, why not?

58
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,242
You just killed your wife.

59
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,721
I didn't kill her. You did.

60
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,009
Look, you want to hurt me? Good.

61
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,083
I want to see you try.

62
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,844
Get it over with.

63
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,449
Over? You cost my father money,
made my family look bad.

64
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,643
Now we're going to make
an extra special example out of you.

65
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,963
So, we looked into your records.
Not much to find.

66
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,606
Work for city,
garbage collection, sanitation.

67
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,604
Good benefits but no glamour, eh?

68
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,481
Father and mother dead,
no brothers or sisters,

69
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,449
which is too bad,

70
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,001
because I would like
to take them from you too.

71
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,367
But you love your wife.
We know that.

72
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,605
So here's the deal.

73
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,809
You're free to go,
but we will have eyes on you.

74
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,248
Not always, but when
you least expect it, we'll be there.

75
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,801
Anyone you try to make friends with
or even talk to,

76
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,327
other than ordering a hot dog
or something,

77
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,485
will die, like your wife,
because of you.

78
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,722
Of course, you can always end it,
jump off a bridge,

79
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,530
throw yourself in front of a train,

80
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,082
damn your eternal soul to hell,
if you believe in that kind of bullshit.

81
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,884
Personally, I don't.

82
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,168
So I'd go for it if I were you.

83
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,687
But I am not you.

84
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,087
Thank God.

85
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,561
So do what you want.

86
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,121
<i>If you're still here tomorrow,
we're going to kill the landlady.</i>

87
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,726
- What was her name?
- Tobolovsky.

88
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,962
Mrs Tobolovsky.

89
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,043
Nice lady.

90
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,002
Clean up the mess, garbage man.

91
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,370
All right, she's your daughter
and she's an American citizen.

92
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,164
I ain't gonna ask what the deal is
with her. That's your business.

93
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,890
But I'm gonna tell you,
pulling strings is hard work,

94
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,929
<i>and hard work don't come free.</i>

95
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,805
Your price, Captain Wolf?

96
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,202
Chinatown precinct take goes up 20%.

97
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,809
Bronx 121st, Brooklyn divisions,
each go up by 10%, monthly.

98
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,123
That's a steep price for a passport
and some papers for a little girl.

99
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,084
Things are tough all over.

100
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,531
Chinatown gets upped 10%.

101
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,967
Bronx and Brooklyn will settle
for the current rate

102
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,690
and the fact
that we won't start shooting

103
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,050
cops and their families in the streets
like dogs at the first sign of pressure.

104
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,801
Things are tough all over.

105
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,367
Hey, man, I know you.
I saw your fight in Jersey.

106
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,171
It was really good.
You knocked that guy out.

107
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,767
- No.
- That was some good shit, man.

108
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,803
Great fight.

109
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,482
The casino?

110
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,402
Exactly 800,000?

111
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,483
It's almost 800.

112
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,249
I'm not asking you if it's almost 800.

113
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,323
I want the exact number.

114
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,363
$785,370.

115
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,803
- And the week before?
- It's losing money.

116
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,610
- What?
- Why?

117
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,010
Because he was hurting business,
and business is a serious matter.

118
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,685
I understand business.

119
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,810
But why beat him
if you were going to kill him anyway?

120
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,563
Fuck you. Fuck you!

121
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,920
- You can't come in the shelter.
- Just trying to get something to eat!

122
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,361
Wrap it up. Lights out in five.

123
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,643
Wrap it up.

124
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,527
Come on, guys.

125
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,523
Nice kicks.

126
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,564
They'd better be here in the morning
or you'll be wearing them on your ears,

127
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,769
'cause I'll chew your feet off
at the goddamn ankles.

128
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,404
I could really use some new shoes, man.
I'll do whatever you want, you know?

129
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,883
Whatever gets you through the night.

130
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,525
- I just... I can't take another...
- Shut up. Shut up.

131
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,001
Shut up and take them.
I've still got my old ones.

132
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,930
<i>Go and get those feet looked at.</i>

133
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,285
Gangrene's setting in.

134
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,205
I will. Thank you, man.

135
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,730
Jesus loves you, brother.
Jesus loves you.

136
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,485
<i>Lights out. Wake-up call's 7am.</i>

137
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,563
<i>Lights out.</i>

138
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,283
<i>Lights out.</i>

139
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,285
Shh.

140
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,011
Mei, I have sad news.

141
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,524
I heard them talking and...
your mother is gone.

142
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,008
She died two weeks ago in the hospital.

143
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,489
They weren't going to tell you,

144
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,530
but I'm telling you
so that you can pray

145
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,728
for her soul to find its way to heaven.

146
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,046
Please don't say anything.
If they find out I told you...

147
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,124
I won't say anything. Thank you.

148
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,564
<i>Everybody up.
Shelter needs to be cleared by 9am.</i>

149
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,441
<i>Bed reservations for tonight
need to be made by 3:30.</i>

150
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,126
<i>Please remove
all your personal belongings.</i>

151
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,327
Everybody up. Come on, let's go.

152
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,767
Take your belongings with you.
You know the drill.

153
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,000
So you wanna tell us what happened?

154
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,049
Someone liked his shoes.

155
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,646
Funny guy. You think this is a joke?

156
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,326
You know, you guys
are a hell of a crack security squad.

157
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,841
You were right here.
You could have said something.

158
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,004
But you were too busy
sleeping off this contraband, right?

159
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,323
Come into this shelter again

160
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,484
and I'm gonna run your raggedy ass
back out into the street.

161
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,762
Hey! Watch where you're going, man.

162
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,651
You could get your ass
kicked for that, OK? Huh?

163
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,643
4.55.

164
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,689
If you got no money,
you gotta get out of line.

165
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,763
I got money.

166
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,648
He doesn't have any money.
Look at him.

167
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,168
Mister, I told you, if you don't
have money, you have to leave, OK?

168
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,368
You gotta get out of line.
People are waiting.

169
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,482
<i>Come on, buddy. You gotta go.</i>

170
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,002
- This guy giving you trouble?
- He's crazy, Officer.

171
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,640
- Get him out of here, OK?
- All right, come on, let's go.

172
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,122
Hey, you, come on. Let's go.
Out. On the street.

173
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,806
Let's go, funny boy. You wanna be
a clown, go join the circus.

174
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,850
Not in my precinct, you hear me?
I don't wanna see you around here. Hey.

175
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,611
Jesus Christ.

176
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,161
Look what the cat dragged in.

177
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,088
Unbelievable.

178
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,210
- Look at him.
- Look at him?

179
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,243
How about the smell?

180
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,003
Think I'll call the boys.

181
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,243
You miss us, partner?

182
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,884
Welcome back to the force.

183
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,247
Mei...

184
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,643
I'm sorry. I can't let them have you.

185
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,085
Mei! Get back here!

186
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,968
- How's your day been, Luke?
- Started lousy. But it's looking up.

187
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,130
<i>Luke Wright, the Big Apple's hardest cop
once upon a time.</i>

188
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,045
You always could take a shot.
But you know what your real talent is?

189
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,771
You're a uniter. I mean, who'd
have thought that us and the Russkies

190
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,922
would ever be on the same page
about anything?

191
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,084
Not me. Nice to see you, rat.

192
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,245
Been wanting to do this ever since the
day you opened your big fucking mouth!

193
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,080
When we heard what Docheski did to you,
I mean, I had to laugh.

194
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,129
I mean, we felt bad for Annie an' all.

195
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,487
Them's the breaks.
She knew who she was with.

196
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,688
Word come up from the street
you were back,

197
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,330
we couldn't believe our fucking ears.

198
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,405
<i>Why would you come back? Why wouldn't
you disappear somewhere far way, huh?</i>

199
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,085
Like the moon.

200
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,607
<i>I missed home.</i>

201
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,604
You were one of us, Luke.
We were a team. We were family.

202
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,843
- Then you threw us under the bus.
- We were kings, you son of a bitch!

203
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,684
Now we're bunch of goddamn serfs.

204
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,208
Hey, hey, easy, Benoit, huh?

205
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,721
When you came back,
we figured you wanted to die.

206
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,168
We got a pool going on when
you're gonna end it and how, you know,

207
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,004
bus, train...

208
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,408
I got my money on suicide by cop.

209
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,208
Come on, take it.

210
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,204
Take a shot. Come on.

211
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,408
Annie's waiting for you.

212
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,643
Question is, do you really think
she wants to see you again?

213
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,006
Hmm?

214
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,370
Actually, my real talent
is costing other people money.

215
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,442
You ought to know that, Lesky.

216
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,764
<i>You're gonna lose that bet.
Unless you wanna shoot me in the back.</i>

217
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,843
Wouldn't be your first time.

218
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,523
Why don't you just end it?

219
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,089
What are you waiting for?

220
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,163
More people around you to die?

221
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,445
What are you waiting for?

222
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,128
For the last time,
give me the numbers.

223
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,365
You're a very brave girl, and clever.

224
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,889
But do you know how we knew exactly
what you can do,

225
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,008
where you're going to be and when?

226
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,561
- Someone told you.
- That's right.

227
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,761
Can you guess who?

228
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,601
Your friend, the one who told you
about your poor mother

229
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,489
when the scum
who took you from home would not.

230
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,371
She's working for us with a smile.

231
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,163
Ling.

232
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,965
In English.

233
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,521
I said speak in English.

234
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,363
Well?

235
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,811
She won't tell me anything.

236
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,730
My father is a patient man.

237
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,080
I am not.

238
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,691
Tell him what he wants to know.

239
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,171
Or I'll...

240
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,402
NYPD! Open the door!

241
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,289
- What the hell?
- This is the police.

242
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,808
We got reports of a disturbance.

243
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,043
Look, you can make this easy
or you can make it hard.

244
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,680
Open the door or we come in by force.

245
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,807
Bullshit, blue.

246
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,123
You come in here, you go out feet first,
I swear on my mother.

247
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,410
Yeah, they're in there, Captain.

248
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,929
They're not cooperating. You better
get down here before things go to hell.

249
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,162
Negative, negative. This is big.

250
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,210
I'm going back to the station to monitor
the city. I'll get back to you.

251
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,362
All right, we got 'em pinned down.
You know what I want.

252
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:10,129
We have a deal. Get the girl,
alive if you can, dead if you can't.

253
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,011
<i>We go in, Brooklyn's take
goes up by 10%. That's the new deal.</i>

254
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,401
<i>Hold on, I got an incoming call.</i>

255
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,449
- Emile, what's up?
- Take your men off, Wolf.

256
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,248
Whatever the Chinese offered to you,
I'll up it by 5%.

257
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,929
Get her back here.

258
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,201
<i>All right, Quan,</i>

259
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,011
<i>I got the Russians
offering to up Brooklyn's take by 7%,</i>

260
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,242
Bronx the same.
So I don't know what to tell you.

261
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,448
My guys are willing
to go to war over this.

262
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,881
You're gonna be stuck between us
and the Russians like Hitler,

263
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,283
fighting on two fronts,
so you better think hard about this one.

264
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,890
10%, both precincts, final offer.

265
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,084
Hey, Mac. Both these bastards
are willing to pay a stiff price

266
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,810
for this little Chink girl.

267
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,850
<i>- Whatever she's got, I want it.
- So what's our play?</i>

268
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,367
<i>I get the Russians
to drop their guard, you go in.</i>

269
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,887
<i>She catches a bullet,
I want you to take out every last one</i>

270
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,525
<i>of those Bolshevik scumbags.</i>

271
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,961
All right, Emile, your offer's good.

272
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,249
<i>I'm gonna call my guys off}
but only 'cause I like you better.</i>

273
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,768
Bullshit. You're a greedy bastard, Wolf.

274
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,130
You got the scent of something big
and now you want it all for yourself.

275
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:42,046
But I have to tell you something before
you send your men in guns blazing.

276
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,441
<i>-  She's gone.
- What do you mean, she's gone?</i>

277
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,930
<i>I mean she escaped, and with
all your men out there, I can't follow.</i>

278
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,242
<i>I offer you a truce until we find her.</i>

279
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,801
<i>Trust me, the Chinese find her first,</i>

280
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,930
<i>that will be a thing you regret
as long as you live.</i>

281
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,089
<i>Docheski, what does she have?</i>

282
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,766
<i>Do we have a truce, Captain Wolf?</i>

283
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,720
The girl is Chinese, 11 years old.

284
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,962
She speaks Mandarin and English.

285
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,965
A photo is being disseminated.

286
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,408
You are to find her
and bring her straight to Centre Street.

287
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,206
She's heading for subway.

288
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,643
Sorry, Annie.

289
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,371
Lost my lock
on the Russian cell on Jay Street.

290
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,806
Sounds like they went into
the subway station. Manhattan bound.

291
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,047
Hey.

292
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,124
You? The garbage collector?

293
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,442
You've got bad information.

294
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,490
I never collected garbage.
I disposed of it.

295
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,128
Don't lose sleep. He had it coming.

296
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,927
Are you all right?

297
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,042
- Get out! Get out!
- Move.

298
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,123
It's OK.

299
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,403
<i>Girl was last seen entering
Jay Street Station. Red alert.</i>

300
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,530
<i>Once found, she needs to be brought
to Captain Wolf at Centre Street.</i>

301
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,011
<i>Repeat, red alert.</i>

302
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,168
Whoa. Easy. Easy there, hon.
We're the police.

303
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,084
Everything's all right.

304
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,163
Hey, what's your name, hon?

305
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,967
This is her.

306
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,884
I don't know. They all look alike to me.

307
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,690
- You got that picture up?
- Yeah, let me see.

308
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,923
Fucking New York City.

309
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,003
Don't see somebody for years.

310
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,561
Then you bump into them twice
in the same day.

311
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,769
Hey, hey, hey. I'm not gonna hurt you.

312
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,447
What the hell did you do, kid?

313
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,767
You know, those men chasing you are bad.

314
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,241
You wanna tell me why they're after you?

315
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,323
You understand me?

316
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,443
Speak English?

317
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,645
The other way! Cars go the other way!

318
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,767
Are you a crazy man?

319
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,083
Hold on.

320
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,364
If this goes on, a lot of
innocent people are gonna get hurt.

321
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,045
You want that?

322
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,885
Good. Then do what I say.

323
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,728
You OK?

324
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,251
Let's go.

325
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,323
I'm not five years old.

326
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,084
Then keep up.

327
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,247
- You had her and you lost her.
- No, Captain, we didn't lose her.

328
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,640
She was taken by force.

329
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,770
- The Russians?
- No, not the Russians.

330
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,090
Well...

331
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,163
- It was Luke Wright.
- What?

332
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,766
- Captain Wolf?
- Not now, David.

333
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,843
The mayor wants you, Captain.

334
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,401
- Put him through on two.
- He's not on the phone.

335
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,929
He wants you at the mansion, yesterday.

336
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,603
There you go.

337
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,561
- Thank you, Mr lvanov.
- Thank you.

338
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,286
Mr lvanov?
Here you are, Mr lvanov. Room 1012.

339
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,647
- Tenth Floor.
- Thank you.

340
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,161
You like a nice hotel.

341
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,243
I've never stayed in a nice hotel.

342
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,162
<i>No one's gonna look for us in one.</i>

343
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,483
Would I love a shower right now.

344
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,283
You could use one.

345
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,484
I could have just let those Russians
grab you on the train.

346
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,569
Why did you save me?

347
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,124
I didn't save you. You saved me.

348
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,123
I'm paying you um.

349
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,690
My name's Luke.

350
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,086
Mei.

351
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,283
You have parents, Mei?

352
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,366
- I have a father.
- What's his name?

353
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,443
Chang Quan.

354
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,283
Chang Quan?

355
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,446
If we're talking about the same guy,

356
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,001
he didn't have any kids
last time I checked.

357
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,242
Any made since
wouldn't be a day over three years old.

358
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,724
I'm adopted.

359
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,323
He bring you over from back home?

360
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,768
Chang isn't the fatherly type.

361
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,769
Why are you here, Mei?

362
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,043
To count.

363
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,528
You were sent over by the old guy,
Chang's boss. What's his name?

364
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,002
<i>Old school.
No computers, no electronic trails.</i>

365
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,162
Just what you have
in your head, right?

366
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,281
- You know Jiao Han?
- I know of him.

367
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,409
He told me a number,
a very long number.

368
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,888
I was going someplace where I would get
another number and more instructions,

369
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,247
but the Russian came and shot everyone.

370
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,721
Then the police came and I ran away.

371
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,486
Now you know everything.
Happiness for you?

372
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,769
You wanna go back to Han Jiao?

373
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,004
I make too much trouble. Bad business.

374
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,925
<i>After I do what he asks, he kills me.
Good business.</i>

375
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,162
So what about this number?

376
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,290
It's a long, boring number.
I can tell it to you.

377
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,447
It wouldn't mean anything to me.

378
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,080
How do you know it's one number
and not a bunch of separate numbers?

379
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,687
You're a crazy man but not so stupid.

380
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,530
Is there anything interesting to you
about these numbers?

381
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,610
- Maybe a few of them.
- Why?

382
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,604
Because they have a three or a seven
before them.

383
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,410
All the numbers are random,

384
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:59,645
but five of them has a seven before
and eight of them has a three before.

385
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,201
That's too many times to be random.

386
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,601
<i>It's a code.</i>

387
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,406
- What else?
- Nothing.

388
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,489
So the three and the seven
are interesting

389
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,961
because they happen too many times
to be random.

390
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,764
Because they're not numbers.
They're words.

391
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,207
Right left or left right.

392
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,443
Old school. Combination to a safe.

393
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,401
In the hotel?

394
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,130
Where?

395
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,683
About five eleven, brown hair, 30s.

396
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,882
Probably came in here
less than a few hours ago.

397
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,883
Sir, we're not allowed
to discuss our guests.

398
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,247
<i>So he's a guest? Did he check in?</i>

399
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,050
I'm sorry, sir.
We're not at liberty to...

400
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,646
He would have been with a Chinese girl,
11 years old.

401
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,531
I'm her father
and I'm very worried about her.

402
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,127
I'm so sorry.
I can call the police for you.

403
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,484
Do that and I blow your brains out.

404
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,607
- Now...
- Don't move.

405
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,000
...what room is he in?

406
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,962
<i>What room is he in?</i>

407
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,809
I think maybe
I put him on the 10th floor.

408
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,883
Room.

409
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,762
I swear he didn't have
a little girl with him.

410
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,446
- Room.
- I just need to check.

411
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,524
Then check quick
or I put a bullet in your brain.

412
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,603
- Quick.
- Put your hands up.

413
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,610
- You don't want any part of this.
- Hands up so I can see 'em.

414
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,049
<i>No one leaves the hotel!</i>

415
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,725
Come on!

416
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,167
1012. He's in room 1012.

417
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,005
I thought you said
no one would look for us here.

418
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,803
<i>I turned it off
so no one could call when I was...</i>

419
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,246
It doesn't need to be on.

420
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,603
- Get back!
- Wait!

421
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,285
Get down on the floor.

422
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,606
Everybody back!

423
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,761
Write down the numbers,

424
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,526
<i>just the ones with the three
and the seven in front of 'em, quick.</i>

425
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,531
You, get over there! Get down! Get down!

426
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,325
I'll try to get you someplace safe.

427
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,642
We get separated,
don't tell them you told me anything.

428
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:43,202
<i>- Mei, if they try to scare you...
- Try? I'm so scared already.</i>

429
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,850
Yeah, me to. Remember, lie.

430
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,206
We're almost there.

431
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,522
If you see them downstairs,
try not to kill the girl.

432
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,721
Back inside.

433
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,846
Follow them!
I'm going back down to cut them off.

434
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,927
<i>The cops are here.
Hold them off until I give the word.</i>

435
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,684
Do not let them in!

436
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,646
Everybody stay down!
You ain't going nowhere! Stay!

437
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,610
Hey, where you going?
Get down! No! Get back down!

438
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,411
- Get back!
- Move! Move!

439
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,083
Get up! Everybody up!

440
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,005
We're getting out of the hotel. Up!

441
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,970
' UP Or I start shooting you! Up!

442
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,686
Moving to corner of 58.
We got a suspect.

443
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,002
Hey, don't move!

444
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,083
Don't move!

445
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,360
<i>Move! Move! Over there! Go!</i>

446
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:46,242
Into the street and keep moving!
Anyone who doesn't dies like this!

447
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,847
Into the street!

448
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,607
Repeat, hold your fire!

449
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,521
They're civilians!

450
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,286
Suspect is in the crowd.
Suspect is in the crowd.

451
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,325
Hey, stop right there!

452
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:51,331
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

453
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,883
That's my car!
Do something, he took my fucking car!

454
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,203
Head downtown.
I'll give you an address in a minute.

455
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,843
Shit.

456
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,610
- Hey, buddy, you wanna give me address?
- In a minute. Just hold on.

457
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,691
He's here? Luke Wright is back
in the city, in my city?

458
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,490
<i>He's been back for a while.</i>

459
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,722
- A while? What's a while?
- Maybe a year. It's hard to say.

460
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,848
Turn that goddamn thing off.

461
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,162
- Alex.
- Guys.

462
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,243
Yes, sir. Sorry, Your Honour.

463
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,761
What's going on, Wolf?
And how's Luke Wright involved in it?

464
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,922
I figured I might ask you
the same question.

465
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,003
Don't try to game me.

466
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,451
You're nothing but a pawn

467
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,847
playing on a board so big
you can't even see the edge.

468
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,809
That's all you've ever been.

469
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:33,203
I knew about Luke Wright, which is more
than you can say until five minutes ago.

470
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,051
What you know about Luke Wright

471
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:39,249
rates less than a paragraph
in a very fat book.

472
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,087
After the towers fell

473
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:44,084
and our manpower was spread out
tracking terrorist activity,

474
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,969
I was the one
who formed the special task force

475
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,849
to deal with the crime
that was filling the gap.

476
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,288
And don't you ever fucking forget that
I was the one who put you in charge.

477
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,841
I didn't forget. My work made you mayor.

478
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,604
Your work?

479
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,411
<i>You think Luke
was just one of your cops?</i>

480
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,767
When I put together your team,
I knew it needed an edge

481
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,362
no ordinary detectives could give me,
something surgical.

482
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,687
I called friends in places buried
so deep they don't officially exist.

483
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:13,323
They were sympathetic.
A week later they sent Luke Wright.

484
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,202
<i>Those wise guys who vanished
over the last seven years,</i>

485
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,283
you think that was internecine war?

486
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,407
Those coke kings
you found in the gutter in Harlem.

487
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,882
Freddy Petrovich in Brooklyn.
Tommy Lau in Chinatown.

488
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,690
Luke Wright is a ghost.

489
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,683
A very deadly ghost.

490
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,323
It worked like a charm too.

491
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:37,567
Then you dicks had to get greedy
and pad your pockets.

492
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:41,008
Luke's a killer, but he's an honest one.

493
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,561
When he threatened to take
the whole thing to IA,

494
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:46,246
it took some people with a lot of bronze
stuck to their pyjamas

495
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,561
to talk him off the ledge.

496
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:50,326
Yeah, my team gets dismantled.
We're peons again.

497
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,845
But if Luke Wright's so connected,

498
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,611
<i>how does he wind up in Jersey
cage fighting on the B circuit?</i>

499
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,762
Do I look like a shrink?

500
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,048
Get everybody on this.

501
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,804
Once Luke Wright gets on a roll,

502
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,883
only one man in this city
can take him on one-on-one.

503
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,121
<i>I know this is a closed door,</i>

504
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,046
but there was just a major gun battle
downtown at a hotel.

505
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,010
Media's going nuts.
You're gonna need to make a statement.

506
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,648
Han Jiao is in the city also.

507
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:19,049
He give this little Chinese girl
something, I don't know what.

508
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,770
Luke Wright grabbed her before I could.

509
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,081
- What?
- I said Luke Wright...

510
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,686
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I heard you the first time.

511
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,085
Close every exit out of Manhattan.

512
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,642
Make sure that neither Wright or the
girl gets away, you get commissioner.

513
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:37,964
Let 'em go... you get a shovel
to dig your own grave.

514
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,686
<i>That girl does not leave this city.</i>

515
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:51,284
We recovered the girl, but the
information might have been compromised.

516
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,841
<i>- Should we change our time frame?
- Impossible.</i>

517
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,082
Now that the whole damn thing
has gone supernova,

518
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,368
it's going to happen
and it's gonna happen tonight.

519
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,050
But the meeting place
needs to be changed.

520
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,680
- Where to?
- I'll let you know.

521
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,763
Here. Right here.

522
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:13,129
Slow down. Stop the car.

523
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,489
No, no, you don't bring
no hookers in my cab, man.

524
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,603
Just keep the meter running.

525
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,568
Ladies.

526
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,643
How about a drink?

527
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,803
Good evening.

528
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,724
- Evening.
- Will you be joining us for dinner?

529
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,360
- We don't have a reservation.
- That's OK.

530
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:45,161
We're busy tonight, but we should
be able to find you something.

531
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:50,008
We don't have any tables downstairs,
but there are some in the back.

532
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:53,521
Or you could sit upstairs if you like.

533
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:04,204
Sir? Sir?
Do you have a preference? Sir?

534
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,850
I think we'll just get a drink
at the bar.

535
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,648
<i>I want you to give me a kiss,
turn round and walk out of here.</i>

536
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,406
- But I thought...
- Just act like you forgot something.

537
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,885
Only don't come back.

538
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,128
Give me a white Russian, please,
and a fork.

539
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,601
- Fork?
- One of those.

540
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,561
What does he drive
and where is it parked?

541
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,322
A silver SUV in the alley outside.

542
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,971
- Vassily.
- Not even close.

543
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,367
Who is this?

544
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,568
The guy who's been
killing your boys all night, Emile.

545
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,724
The guy who has your son tied up
in a very dark place.

546
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,607
Now, here's what I want.

547
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,330
<i>You think I give a shit
of what you want?</i>

548
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,721
Do you think you can blackmail me
because you have Vassily?

549
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,486
<i>- Kill him and go to hell.
- I'm going to hell all right.</i>

550
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,881
<i>But I'm not gonna kill your boy.</i>

551
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,441
<i>I'm gonna keep him around, like a pet.</i>

552
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:57,171
A very badly treated pet.

553
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,163
I'm gonna do things to him
that'll make me ashamed

554
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:02,324
to look in the mirror afterward,
but I will do them.

555
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,322
<i>Vassily's gonna tell me everything
he knows about your operation.</i>

556
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,051
And then what you gonna do?
Tell the police?

557
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:13,362
- You want me to laugh?
- Who said anything about the police?

558
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,602
I'm gonna share the information
with the competition,

559
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,364
the ones I haven't already killed.

560
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,887
<i>Anything they don't take from you,
I will.</i>

561
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:23,203
<i>First I'm gonna take your trophy wife.</i>

562
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:26,204
<i>Then I'm gonna take
your trophy children.</i>

563
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:27,850
<i>I'm gonna leave you with nothing.</i>

564
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,361
When I'm done, you won't even be
a memory of a memory.

565
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,763
<i>- But that doesn't have to happen.
- What do you want?</i>

566
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,842
- I wanna know what's in the safe.
- What safe?

567
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,004
The safe the girl gave me
the combination to. That safe.

568
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,123
<i>$30 million.</i>

569
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,485
Kid was on her way to get a second
number. What's in the second safe?

570
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,962
Something worth $30 million.

571
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:56,361
- To who?
- No idea.

572
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:00,047
That's 'cause
you're only half-smart, Emile.

573
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,804
So here's the deal.

574
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,566
You tell me where the first safe is,
I take the money and let your boy go.

575
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,371
<i>Lie to me and your world ends.
You have my word on that.</i>

576
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:13,411
Idiot. I know
when a man is working alone

577
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,927
and you're as alone as one can be.

578
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,890
You need a small army
to get near that safe,

579
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,122
the kind of army I have.

580
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:25,080
Had. It's been shrinking by the minute.

581
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,965
<i>Last chance before I hang up
and go to work on your son.</i>

582
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,323
Going to kill me, garbage man?

583
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:40,003
You could have taken us out that day,
couldn't you?

584
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,208
But you just sat there,

585
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,966
let us ruin you,
let us make you nothing.

586
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:49,091
I guess finding out about that safe gave
you new motivation, eh garbage man?

587
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,561
I wouldn't spend my time talking
if I were you.

588
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:57,444
Spend it praying that when this is over
that little girl's still alive.

589
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,043
Pray

590
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:11,927
When and where?

591
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:15,050
<i>The underpass under the bridge,
one hour.</i>

592
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:22,446
I'm sorry I pointed a gun at you
when the Russians attacked us, Mei.

593
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,689
- It was...
- Business. I know.

594
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,161
It's good. It's good you understand.

595
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,322
We're going to get this done

596
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,642
and you'll be safe
with me and Uncle Han.

597
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:35,850
I promise to be a better father to you

598
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,082
than the one
who left you and your mother.

599
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,251
There's no one in the world
who cares more about you.

600
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,648
You know that, don't you?

601
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,047
Well, the gang's all here.

602
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,929
Almost.

603
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:23,209
- Reddick have to call in sick?
- He's in the hospital, dickhead.

604
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:26,921
- You broke his trachea.
- I didn't know a trachea could break.

605
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,969
- Hope they can fix it.
- Yeah? How about I fix you?

606
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,600
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Not here.

607
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:36,082
It's been a while, Luke.
Can't say I missed you.

608
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:41,206
- So, let's get down to business.
- Did you bring what I asked for?

609
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,602
- Toscanni's.
- Where else?

610
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:06,161
Mmm. That's good.

611
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,923
Been in restaurants all night.

612
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,883
All I got sewed was lead.

613
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:33,764
- Anyone got a light?
- You know what? Screw this.

614
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,287
<i>Look, Captain, you asked us
to come here, so we came.</i>

615
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,006
But I ain't gonna sit here
and listen to this scumbag's big mouth.

616
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,083
Shut up, Kolfax.

617
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:44,086
Still haven't quit, huh?

618
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,646
Hey. Hey, what the hell is that?

619
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,723
Combination of the safe
with 30 million bucks in it.

620
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,281
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Filthy piece of shit.

621
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,250
The only place it exists now is in here.

622
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,846
Remember that next time
your little trigger finger gets itchy.

623
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,206
Why would Han Jiou stash it

624
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,840
right in the middle of Chinatown's
busiest gambling den?

625
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,122
Because of sleaze-bucket cops
like you, Benoit,

626
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,726
who collect off of Chinatown's
busiest gambling den.

627
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:18,201
Where else would he surround it
with dozens of armed man

628
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:19,885
without attracting police attention?

629
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:23,362
Captain, why do we know this son of
a bitch on the level, huh? He's a bum.

630
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,443
Where'd you get your information?

631
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,322
There's an exchange happening tonight.

632
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,522
The Triad half of the deal
is in a safe in the casino.

633
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:34,207
No way I could get to it on my own,
so I called on you, my old pals.

634
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,921
30 million split six ways
is still a lot of money.

635
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:44,366
We're risking a lot, Captain.
You especially.

636
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:47,000
Everybody knows you got a bright future.

637
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:50,004
Promised by who? His Honour?

638
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,766
What carrot
is he teasing you with, Wolf?

639
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,207
He's gonna let you out in the street
knowing what you know now?

640
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,486
What's that supposed to mean?

641
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,405
His second term is gonna come to an end
and his hold on the city goes poof.

642
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,927
Just like that he's Joe Citizen again.

643
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,247
30 million would be
a nice retirement package.

644
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,606
What's he giving the Chinks?

645
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:09,481
If I knew that, I wouldn't be standing
here with you assholes, would I?

646
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:12,645
A bright future, huh?

647
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,450
Big headlines.

648
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:17,922
<i>"Hero cops take down New York City's
biggest underground gambling operation."</i>

649
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,970
Five million bucks apiece
that no one will ever know about,

650
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,327
<i>just to give it that extra sweet taste.</i>

651
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:44,240
All right, who's been in there?
For Christ's sake, who's been in there?

652
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,641
- Me, Cap.
- You two, you're on point.

653
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,485
<i>Place is packed with civilians,
so exercise some judgment.</i>

654
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,688
Remember, I got the combination.

655
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:54,002
You want that money, watch my back.

656
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,642
Where are you going?

657
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:15,485
Don't move! Stay!

658
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,131
Out of the way! Move!

659
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,491
Hey, you, settle down!

660
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,401
This way. Let's go.

661
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,440
Heads up.

662
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,528
Go.

663
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:08,168
Kolfax, take him out.

664
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,050
Cover him.

665
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,564
Open it. Take it!

666
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,571
Oh, shit!

667
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,403
Oh, shit.
I gotta get out of here.

668
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,404
Oh, fuck. Fuck, Captain.

669
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:31,003
God, you shit!
Shoot a man in the back, son of a bitch!

670
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:34,844
- All right, Mears, where we going?
- This way.

671
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,444
<i>Move.</i>

672
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:18,000
- The gates of paradise.
- Locked and bolted to sinners like us.

673
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:20,970
Yeah, well,
let's not wait for an invitation.

674
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,406
All right, you bastard. Get started.

675
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,648
Here's how we do this.

676
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:58,724
You put down your guns, I open the safe.

677
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,207
<i>If you wanna shoot me, go ahead.</i>

678
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:05,489
<i>Make your minds up quick
'cause the real cops'll be here soon.</i>

679
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,043
On the floor.

680
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:45,202
Come on, you son of a bitch.
What are you trying to pull?

681
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:48,011
I had right left switched.
It's gonna open.

682
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,086
You'll live.

683
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,723
Left 26.

684
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,169
Captain Wolf,
what the hell happened in here?

685
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,971
What do you think happened, huh?
We had a raid on the place go bad.

686
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,202
<i>We got dead cops, casualties.
Get in there, will you?</i>

687
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,886
- Captain Wolf, you need an ambulance.
- I need a fleet of ambulances.

688
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:38,805
Call it in, will you? I'll take
my own busted ass to the hospital.

689
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,245
Not bad.

690
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:46,085
If you weren't such a double-dealing
asshole, I could almost like you.

691
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:48,607
Almost. Drive.

692
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,130
It's a scratch.

693
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:01,921
I'm not gonna kill you, but I didn't say
I was putting you up at the Ritz.

694
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,365
Wolf.

695
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,443
<i>I have your money, Danny.</i>

696
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,087
What?

697
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:19,324
You heard me.

698
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:22,723
30 million. Five-thousand
and one-thousand dollar bills.

699
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,564
<i>- I wanna talk.
- No.</i>

700
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:27,041
<i>No, what you wanna do is calm down
so we can talk like adults.</i>

701
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,804
<i>Shut it, Danny.</i>

702
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,968
<i>I wanna talk,
but I don't wanna talk to you.</i>

703
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,531
<i>I wanna talk to your boyfriend.</i>

704
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,410
This is Alex.

705
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,887
<i>Been a while, Alex.</i>

706
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,361
- How'd you get this number?
- Come on, Alex.

707
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:45,568
Reach up the mayor's ass, there you are.

708
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:50,001
A man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do, huh?

709
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:52,162
He's a better catch
than Annie was anyway.

710
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:55,529
<i>I never understood
how you hooked up with a cow like that.</i>

711
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:58,251
It was never about her looks.
It was her sense of humour.

712
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,528
<i>She's not so funny now, is she?</i>

713
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:03,081
No, she's not. Neither am I.

714
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:07,605
I have the money, Alex.
I had to kill a lot of people to get it.

715
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,125
<i>So listen up.</i>

716
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:13,569
You haven't made the combination
exchange yet. What's in the other safe?

717
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:16,121
A disc.

718
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:18,760
Names, money trails.

719
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:21,810
<i>When our commanders sent the two of us
to help Danny clean up the city,</i>

720
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:22,961
<i>they attached a price.</i>

721
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,610
In exchange, Danny looked the other way

722
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:27,604
while the assets seized from every group
deemed a terrorist organisation

723
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,569
were funnelled
into their private accounts.

724
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:31,245
<i>Amazing what people
let you get away with</i>

725
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,243
<i>when they're scared
and wanna feel protected.</i>

726
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,164
Amazing how many scumbags
there are out there

727
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:36,845
waiting to take advantage of it.

728
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,570
<i>- Like you didn't?
- I quit.</i>

729
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:41,610
Bet that helps all those souls you sent
to meet their maker without due process

730
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:42,886
rest a whole lot easier.

731
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:44,929
<i>You thought you could atone
by climbing into a cage</i>

732
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:47,082
<i>and allowing yourself
to get beaten to a pulp?</i>

733
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:48,924
<i>Don't fucking preach at me, Luke.</i>

734
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,731
I'm getting paid for services rendered.

735
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:56,169
<i>Right. You sell the disc to the Chinese
so they can blackmail our old honchos,</i>

736
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:59,881
<i>take the 30 mill and waltz off
with Danny to a villa in the Bahamas.</i>

737
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:02,486
Bali, but whatever, right?

738
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:05,564
So, now you know. Now what?

739
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,489
<i>Now you're dealing with me.</i>

740
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:10,126
- All right, I'm turning around.
- No, you're not.

741
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,806
What are you talking about?
You've got the money.

742
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:18,090
<i>- The Chinese have nothing I care about.
- No. They have something I do.</i>

743
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:39,367
Give the girl the combination to your
safe and she will give you our number.

744
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:41,284
We go to your location, you go to ours.

745
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:44,609
<i>When we've gotten the disc,
we will explain the code</i>

746
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:45,921
and you'll get the cash.

747
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,603
That's the deal.

748
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:52,324
- Let's hear it.
- It's a very long number.

749
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,881
You'll want to write it down.

750
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,929
Thank goodness I brought a pen, huh?

751
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:08,044
You might wanna close your eyes.

752
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,611
Have it your way.

753
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,443
Come on, Luke.

754
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,881
<i>The old place, just you and me.</i>

755
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:33,965
You're a friend of Luke?

756
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,482
Not as far as you're concerned.

757
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:52,202
<i>The violence
that has rocked the city tonight</i>

758
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:53,691
<i>continued in a bloody gun battle</i>

759
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,684
<i>in a Chinatown nightclub
less than an hour ago.</i>

760
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:59,047
- This is really getting out of hand.
- You think?

761
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:01,128
Thanks for that insight.

762
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:04,011
Your Honour,
Alex Rosen's on your private line.

763
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:05,605
He says that it's urgent.

764
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:08,969
- Excuse me, Your Honour.
- Back in five. Don't bother me now.

765
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,248
Why didn't he call me on my cellphone?

766
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,210
I thought I told you to put
all my calls through to the...

767
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:18,124
I always told you this place
had lousy security standards.

768
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:23,329
Because nobody's been crazy enough to
come in here and pull a stunt like this.

769
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:27,121
- You got some balls, Luke.
- Yeah, amazing I can even walk.

770
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,805
The disc.

771
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:31,161
What, you think I'm stupid enough
to let a gang of Chinese

772
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,641
walk up the front steps and collect it
from me in my living room?

773
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:37,327
- It's in a safe far away from here.
- I don't think you're stupid.

774
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:40,450
Which is why I don't for a second
believe you gave away the only copy.

775
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,728
I'm going to meet Alex.

776
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:46,202
First you give me the disc or I'll put
bullets in places that won't kill you

777
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:49,569
but make you spend
the rest of your life wishing I had.

778
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:58,885
Satisfied?

779
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,327
<i>I wanna make sure
it's not ABBA's Greatest Hits.</i>

780
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,564
Alex will kill you, you know.

781
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:16,041
Yeah, probably.

782
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:02,243
Jesus. Luke, you look like hell.

783
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:07,603
Just alcohol, lack of sunlight,
sleep deprivation.

784
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,043
Other than that, I feel great.

785
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:17,170
You know, I was thinking, how many
bodies have we dumped in this place?

786
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:20,611
<i>You know, I didn't keep count.</i>

787
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,002
They were all assholes, though, right?

788
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:29,601
Let her go, Alex.

789
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:34,169
Danny called.
He told me about your visit.

790
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,604
I have to admit,
even I didn't see that one coming.

791
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:42,324
You had the disc and the money.

792
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,801
What...

793
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,611
What is she to you?

794
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:51,087
Life.

795
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:56,208
Well, enjoy it while it lasts,

796
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:58,931
'cause she's the reason
yours is gonna be a whole lot shorter.

797
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:01,883
The money, Luke.

798
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,963
In the car.

799
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:09,205
Or in the bank.

800
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:14,600
Or in a series of lockers
at Grand Central.

801
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:18,731
Or maybe I donated it to charity,
out of the goodness of my heart.

802
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:23,690
You wanna find out where that money is,
you're gonna have to do it the hard way.

803
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:20,601
You all right, Mei?

804
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:24,082
I saw him fight before.
Bad business for you.

805
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,928
Yeah. The worst.

806
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:31,725
You saved me, again.

807
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:34,605
We save each other.

808
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:40,890
I know how you feel.

809
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,162
Help me get this sack of garbage
out of the car.

810
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,681
Make sure he gets to his daddy
safe and sound.

811
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:55,089
50 grand, for your trouble.

812
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:58,005
<i>Might not seem like much, but at least
you're gonna live to enjoy it.</i>

813
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:01,767
You want him safe and sound
after what he did to you?

814
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:05,804
For her sake.

815
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,363
We meet again, all bets are off.

816
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:59,767
- Watch where you're fucking going, man!
- Keep walking.

817
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:02,082
- Excuse me? Pardon me? Anything?
- Walk.

818
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:04,163
This is fucking New York City!

819
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:17,971
- Bank number five. How many more?
- That's it.

820
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:21,930
Got copies of the disc
in security boxes all over the city.

821
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,286
Anything happens to us,

822
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,522
a lot of important people
are gonna be very sorry.

823
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:28,445
Our security. Good business for us.

824
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:33,530
- What now?
- Now we get out of town.

825
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:40,726
Mei, you're a kid and...
I'm not sure I could be a good father.

826
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,564
I think that ship has sailed.

827
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:44,563
I don't want no more fathers.

828
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:49,048
Will you be my friend?

829
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:52,283
Till my dying day...

830
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:59,928
I got info on a school
for gifted kids up in Seattle.

831
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:04,927
It's a nice drive,
if you like trees and shit.

832
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:08,087
Are we safe?

833
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:13,648
One day at a time, Mei.
One day at a time.
