00:00:36,351 --> 00:00:39,979
布鲁克林，纽约，一小时前

5
00:00:37,492 --> 00:00:40,662
把她带过来！轻点，她只是个孩子！

6
00:00:41,126 --> 00:00:42,426
好吧，我大可以杀了她

7
00:01:28,795 --> 00:01:32,039
南京，中国，一年前

8
00:01:27,216 --> 00:01:32,039
204,35倍，是另外一种算法，加起来是350

9
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:36,837
如果用另外一种算法，加起来是365

10
00:01:36,885 --> 00:01:38,922
只有一个算法是对的

11
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:41,216
（两人都做错了，定义域是X|X≠-2，
嘴上说的和黑板上的也牛头不对马嘴）

12
00:01:41,437 --> 00:01:43,927
苏先生，我没有不尊重你的意思

13
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:46,740
但是你的算法是错的

14
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:53,989
梅

15
00:01:54,068 --> 00:01:56,335
我们要把你转去另一个学校

16
00:01:56,476 --> 00:01:58,629
可是我的朋友都在这儿，而且我的妈妈...

17
00:01:58,762 --> 00:02:02,279
梅，你太聪明了，你是个天才

18
00:02:02,352 --> 00:02:04,156
你该上一个特殊的学校

19
00:02:04,204 --> 00:02:06,971
你可以找新朋友的

20
00:02:07,036 --> 00:02:11,455
别难过，梅，我们永远都是你的朋友，听说北京的小孩人都很好的

21
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,749
你在那儿会过得很开心的

22
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:15,938
我根本就不喜欢数学

23
00:02:15,986 --> 00:02:20,213
我喜欢我现在的朋友，我不想要交新的朋友，我不喜欢数学

24
00:02:20,298 --> 00:02:22,299
你来做数学，我们给你写信，

25
00:02:22,374 --> 00:02:25,114
我们每个星期都给你往北京写封信

26
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,209
你发誓？

27
00:02:26,287 --> 00:02:29,493
当然，你想让我们失去一个有名的朋友吗？

28
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:31,500
不，梅，我们永远都是你的...

29
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:39,433
新泽西联航中心球馆

30
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:42,595
这是我的侄女，白玉

31
00:04:42,685 --> 00:04:44,524
认识吧？

32
00:04:44,641 --> 00:04:46,662
她在我朋友的班里

33
00:04:46,684 --> 00:04:50,360
她说啊，你的脑筋啊很像电脑

34
00:04:51,283 --> 00:04:55,508
我跟你的老师讲过了，他也这样说

35
00:04:56,599 --> 00:04:58,659
你知道了吧

36
00:05:00,473 --> 00:05:02,615
很可爱啊

37
00:05:02,923 --> 00:05:11,130
电脑很讨厌，太容易留下痕迹，他们还说...

38
00:05:11,856 --> 00:05:13,018
走开呀，走开！

39
00:05:16,345 --> 00:05:21,228
你学的东西你不会忘的，是不是？

40
00:05:28,047 --> 00:05:34,348
那我到你的家，把你的妈妈杀掉好不好啊！

41
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,695
很好，很好

42
00:05:49,085 --> 00:05:51,258
看来他们说的对了

43
00:05:51,574 --> 00:05:56,680
苏先生告诉我你小的时候你爸爸已经走掉了

44
00:05:56,754 --> 00:06:00,486
你的妈妈现在很病了

45
00:06:01,766 --> 00:06:05,816
很快你变成一个人，你喜欢孤独吗？

46
00:06:08,111 --> 00:06:14,008
放心，我们会好好照顾你的妈妈

47
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,534
张，你的新爸爸

48
00:06:17,609 --> 00:06:22,131
他呢会带你漂洋过海，不过那边那里的人呢很喜欢

49
00:06:22,328 --> 00:06:24,677
找我们的麻烦，所以我要你

50
00:06:24,811 --> 00:06:27,227
帮我们算一算

51
00:11:13,246 --> 00:11:16,635
卫路的店，这个礼拜是两万六千，上个礼拜是二十六

52
00:11:17,115 --> 00:11:20,308
侯进每个礼拜是正好一万五千

53
00:11:20,726 --> 00:11:22,658
他在博易街的店

54
00:11:23,501 --> 00:11:26,749
五月份在丢钱，但是七月八月份他就赚回来了

55
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,524
中国城，纽约，一年后

56
00:11:27,783 --> 00:11:32,119
邵成，上个礼拜是42，这个礼拜是42.5

57
00:11:32,162 --> 00:11:35,300
每个月盈利增长7%

58
00:11:35,365 --> 00:11:39,896
莫特区整个盈利总共上升了72535

59
00:11:40,929 --> 00:11:43,704
我们从梁先生那里拿了5%

60
00:11:43,775 --> 00:11:47,426
他们都每个礼拜盈利6千到8千

61
00:11:50,441 --> 00:11:53,844
上个礼拜是八十万，这个礼拜也是八十万

62
00:12:36,915 --> 00:12:37,476
停！

63
00:12:39,322 --> 00:12:41,792
不要打了，拜托，不要打了

64
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:59,290
今晚，你们会有一个新的场上工头

65
00:12:59,374 --> 00:13:03,565
如果钱又少了，那就不知道谁会走！

66
00:13:09,211 --> 00:13:10,110
今天晚上他请

67
00:13:10,283 --> 00:13:11,398
肯定不是我请

68
00:13:11,973 --> 00:13:13,499
肯定你啊，这么多钱

69
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:15,275
他赢了这么多钱

70
00:13:32,377 --> 00:13:38,156
看来你还是不懂这个生意，不说了

71
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,520
吃你的饭吧

72
00:17:54,585 --> 00:18:00,633
梅，到你房间去记住这些数字

73
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,171
我已经记住了

74
00:18:03,848 --> 00:18:07,306
这些数字很重要

75
00:18:07,437 --> 00:18:11,269
为了你妈，你要认真一点，知道吗？

76
00:18:11,386 --> 00:18:14,084
你真的记住了？

77
00:18:14,273 --> 00:18:18,165
我可以给你重复一遍，但是又长又无聊

78
00:18:23,094 --> 00:18:27,018
你看，还没到一年呢，她已经自信的很了

79
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:33,895
如果，她说她可以背出密码，她就能背出

80
00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:35,950
我保证

81
00:18:37,232 --> 00:18:37,858
好了好了

82
00:18:38,765 --> 00:18:42,237
我们要交给你一个很重要的工作

83
00:20:26,174 --> 00:20:29,845
梅，这是你的指令

84
00:20:30,033 --> 00:20:35,684
张会带你见一个人，那个人会给你一个新的数字

85
00:20:35,778 --> 00:20:38,082
记住那个数字

86
00:20:38,213 --> 00:20:44,324
然后呢张会带你去一个地方，你会得到最后的指令

87
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,500
你学的很快

88
00:21:00,653 --> 00:21:04,943
如果干的好，你会跟着韩叔前途无量

89
00:24:46,977 --> 00:24:54,276
梅，我跟他们讲他们想知道的事情
他们给了我一把一把的钱

90
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:59,668
没事，你要是这么做他们也会帮助你的

91
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:01,074
你真是个笨女人

92
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,390
你不知道生意

93
00:25:04,594 --> 00:25:07,013
你给了他们想要的东西，现在他们要杀了你

94
00:36:36,807 --> 00:36:40,399
什姆亚金和其他人消失了是什么意思？

95
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,205
有人把她带走了

96
00:36:42,774 --> 00:36:45,508
不是警察，他还差点干掉几个警察

97
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:49,053
也不是中国人，我不知道他到底是谁

98
00:36:49,188 --> 00:36:55,728
干掉他，活捉女孩，不行就全干掉

99
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,115
我能查到的就是这些了

100
00:44:33,339 --> 00:44:34,218
怎么样?

101
00:44:34,655 --> 00:44:37,751
我们现在在找一个男的，他和一个女孩在一起

102
00:44:37,903 --> 00:44:41,922
他有武器，非常危险，警察局的人说他是…

103
00:56:05,208 --> 00:56:07,687
谁杀了那个俄国人?

104
00:56:08,601 --> 00:56:10,527
我不知道,他没有告诉我

105
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:13,655
他有没有问到那个数字？

106
00:56:14,656 --> 00:56:16,366
每个人都问那个数字

107
00:56:21,058 --> 00:56:24,395
那你跟他们讲些什么呢？

108
00:56:28,499 --> 00:56:29,922
我什么都没说

109
00:56:31,086 --> 00:56:32,163
什么？

110
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:35,969
我什么都没说

111
00:56:38,136 --> 00:56:39,723
你在撒谎！！！

112
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:41,391
韩叔叔我当然不会给你撒谎的

113
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:46,292
打个电话告诉他们把阿梅的妈妈干掉

114
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,358
因为她的女儿是骗子

115
00:56:50,533 --> 00:56:54,060
韩叔叔，我发誓，我假装不会说英文也听不懂

116
00:56:54,191 --> 00:56:58,804
他们又吼又叫的但是我什么都没说，因为我知道你会生气的

117
00:56:58,976 --> 00:57:00,473
我向我妈发誓

118
00:59:01,085 --> 00:59:04,541
我从来不知这种时候该说什么

119
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:09,143
什么时候？

120
00:59:09,309 --> 00:59:11,750
在我杀人之前

121
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:36,244
我们被袭击了

122
01:11:36,352 --> 01:11:38,434
他们不是俄国人，好像是警察

123
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:40,415
不过他们比警察更厉害

124
01:11:40,541 --> 01:11:44,273
派点人来，他们杀了很多人，快点啊，我们需要...

125
01:11:45,438 --> 01:11:51,781
告诉张，尽快拿到那个数字然后把跑腿的干掉

126
01:11:52,008 --> 01:11:57,099
这个数字由我们自己来破解

127
01:11:57,218 --> 01:11:57,828
你们听懂了吗？

128
01:24:41,690 --> 01:24:43,177
最尊敬的叔叔

129
01:24:43,309 --> 01:24:46,931
这里有两千九百九十五万美元

130
01:24:47,041 --> 01:24:51,527
我们会还余下的5万，再加10%的利息

131
01:24:52,144 --> 01:24:54,126
如果万一您还生气

132
01:24:54,296 --> 01:24:59,548
我必须告诉您，我知道您在中国城生意的每一个帐号

133
01:24:59,632 --> 01:25:02,415
还有汇钱到中国的途径

134
01:25:02,516 --> 01:25:06,958
您不找我们的麻烦，我们也不会找您的麻烦

135
01:25:07,292 --> 01:25:10,079
来追我们的话，你的世界就完了

136
01:25:10,282 --> 01:25:12,477
我保证说话算话

137
01:25:15,173 --> 01:25:17,173
给我准备飞机票

138
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:20,616
我再也不想看到这个

139
01:25:21,799 --> 01:25:23,009
鬼地方！

141
00:28:41,425 --> 00:28:43,516
警察跟我们干上了

142
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:45,300
是吗？

143
00:28:45,487 --> 00:28:46,513
你没有办法？

144
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:52,400
你这个不动脑筋的笨蛋,如果你让警察

145
00:28:52,593 --> 00:28:58,361
或俄国人先找到那个女孩,我就砍了你人头

146
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,700
我们开打吧

147
00:40:41,124 --> 00:40:44,500
她一定在这里，不过我看不清楚

148
00:40:44,635 --> 00:40:46,898
干扰太多

149
00:40:47,133 --> 00:40:48,419
等一下

150
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:49,844
等一下！

151
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,000
我找到她了

152
00:52:04,658 --> 00:52:05,500
谁？

153
00:52:05,733 --> 00:52:10,400
你以为是谁？我是皮特,你电话里没我号码吗？

154
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:14,100
皮特？警察说在地铁里发现你跟...

155
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:17,500
警方报告有误

156
00:52:17,655 --> 00:52:19,331
其他人被...

157
00:52:19,983 --> 00:52:21,800
什么声音？

158
00:52:22,659 --> 00:52:25,000
抱歉，信号不好

159
00:52:25,072 --> 00:52:27,000
我拿到数字了

160
00:52:27,188 --> 00:52:28,500
什么？

161
00:52:28,567 --> 00:52:32,500
在她被劫走前，我们从她那拿到数字了

162
00:52:32,587 --> 00:52:36,500
我跟条子玩了几个小时的捉迷藏

163
00:52:36,602 --> 00:52:39,747
伊哥，把数字记到手机里

164
00:52:40,327 --> 00:52:42,004
说吧，告诉我数字

165
00:52:42,004 --> 00:52:47,000
你疯了吗？数字在一公里外一张纸上，你在哪？

166
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:48,300
他可能带警察来了

167
00:52:48,419 --> 00:52:52,000
我们要清场吗？

168
00:52:52,187 --> 00:52:55,000
如果有警察，我们最好避开人群

169
00:52:55,095 --> 00:52:57,080
而且需要有利地形

170
00:52:59,688 --> 00:53:00,964
好的，皮特...

171
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:04,500
现在给你个机会做英雄

172
00:53:04,583 --> 00:53:05,700
曼梦西卡见

173
00:53:05,773 --> 00:53:07,200
快来

174
00:53:07,582 --> 00:53:09,250
我马上到

175
00:00:47,895 --> 00:00:48,926
你在骗我
You're lying to me.

176
00:00:49,105 --> 00:00:51,477
没有！我不知道你在说什么
I'm not.
I don't know what you're talking about.

177
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:54,436
我不知道你想要什么，我发誓
I don't know what you want from me.
I swear I don't.

178
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,270
我有三个孩子
I have three children.

179
00:00:56,445 --> 00:00:59,446
作为父亲，首先要学会的
The first thing you have to learn
as a father is to know

180
00:00:59,615 --> 00:01:02,071
就是知道你的孩子何时在欺骗你
when your children are lying to you.

181
00:01:04,161 --> 00:01:07,198
你在欺骗我，如果你不说真话
You're lying to me,
and if you don't stop,

182
00:01:07,373 --> 00:01:11,121
我就要用你们那些有名的手段
I'm going to use one of those tortures
your people are so famous for

183
00:01:11,293 --> 00:01:14,912
来折磨你弱小的身体，直到你告诉我一切
on your little body
until you tell me what I want to know.

184
00:01:22,054 --> 00:01:26,467
最后一次，告诉我那些数字
For the last time,
give me the numbers.

185
00:02:32,316 --> 00:02:33,248
梅！
Mei!

186
00:02:47,807 --> 00:02:49,764
你怎么还敢来这？
How dare you come here!
You have no right!

187
00:02:49,934 --> 00:02:52,638
- 妈妈！别打了！住手！
- 你没资格待在这里！没资格！
- Ma, enough! Stop!
- You've no right to be here. No right!

188
00:02:52,812 --> 00:02:56,679
你应该被关在监狱里！监狱里！
You should be in jail!
You should be in jail!

189
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:01,066
滚出去！你给我滚出去！
You get out of here!
You get out of here.

190
00:03:01,237 --> 00:03:03,810
- 对不起
- 我要杀掉你！我会杀掉你的！
- I'm sorry.
- I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

191
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:19,791
你个废物！那孩子不应该出现在擂台上！
Piece of garbage. The kid
should never been in there with me.

192
00:03:20,798 --> 00:03:22,458
路克，别这样！你疯了吗？
Luke, come on. What, are you crazy, man?

193
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:25,468
- 走开！
- 给我走开！
- Get off.
- Get off, now!

194
00:03:26,303 --> 00:03:27,548
我从来都不喜欢你，路克
I never liked you, Luke.

195
00:03:27,721 --> 00:03:30,722
你比擂台上90%的人都厉害
You're a betterfighter than 90%
of the guys you go in the cage with,

196
00:03:30,891 --> 00:03:33,561
但你却任人蹂躏
but you just let 'em pound on you
like you're a side of beef.

197
00:03:33,727 --> 00:03:36,135
你几乎输给过擂台上的每一个笨蛋
You already lost to every chump
in the circuit.

198
00:03:36,313 --> 00:03:38,306
但是昨晚
But last night, of all nights,

199
00:03:38,482 --> 00:03:40,807
你应该在第二轮输掉的，你个混蛋
you're supposed to go down
in the second, you son of a bitch.

200
00:03:40,985 --> 00:03:42,183
- 仅仅一拳！
- 退后！
- Once.
- Back off.

201
00:03:42,361 --> 00:03:44,935
我就打了他一拳！你从哪里找到他的，操场？
I hit him once. Where'd you find him,
the fucking playground?

202
00:03:45,114 --> 00:03:47,071
Youtube，你个混蛋
YouTube, you asshole.

203
00:03:47,241 --> 00:03:50,076
在你把他打晕前，那个孩子还是个网络红人
The kid's an internet sensation
until you put him in a coma,

204
00:03:50,202 --> 00:03:53,120
坦白说，我并不关心这个
which frankly
I do not give a shit about.

205
00:03:53,289 --> 00:03:55,328
但是你让我输掉了100万美元
But you cost me a million dollars,

206
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:58,833
当然这和你让德切斯基输掉的比起来就不算什么了
which is nothing
compared what you cost Docheski.

207
00:03:59,003 --> 00:04:01,328
很好！这个名字耳熟吧？
Yeah. You recognise the name?

208
00:04:01,505 --> 00:04:03,877
他在你身上下了大赌注
He was betting on you big time
to take the dive.

209
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:05,716
他会把这一切都怪罪到我头上来的
And he's gonna take it out on me too

210
00:04:05,885 --> 00:04:09,135
因为他知道这件事情是我这白痴搞出来的
'cause he knows I'm the schmuck
that set this whole thing up.

211
00:04:10,097 --> 00:04:14,843
除非我把你的脑袋送给他
Unless I deliver your head
with a down payment.

212
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,228
你知道俄国人是什么样子的
You know how the Russians are.

213
00:04:33,537 --> 00:04:35,577
梅
Mei.

214
00:04:35,748 --> 00:04:37,491
梅
Mei.

215
00:06:29,403 --> 00:06:32,523
你打对号码了，有什么事就留言吧
<i>You got the right number,
so leave the right message.</i>

216
00:06:32,698 --> 00:06:35,319
听到后立刻给我回电，安妮，立刻
Call me when you get this, Annie.
I mean right away.

217
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:37,070
如果你出去了，别回家
If you're out, don't go home.

218
00:06:37,244 --> 00:06:39,284
我不是在吓唬你，记得赶紧回电话
If I'm scaring you, that's good.
Call me.

219
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,243
安妮？
Annie?

220
00:07:11,487 --> 00:07:13,480
就这样？
That's it?

221
00:07:14,281 --> 00:07:17,532
我听说你是个硬汉啊
I heard you were
some kind of a tough guy.

222
00:07:17,701 --> 00:07:20,192
不挣扎下？
No fighting?

223
00:07:20,371 --> 00:07:23,288
就直接跪在地上像只求死的狗一样？
You're just going to sit on the floor
like a dog who wants to die?

224
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,408
不好意思搞得那么乱
Sorry it had to be so messy.

225
00:07:27,128 --> 00:07:29,120
这些家伙还在学习中
The boy is still learning.

226
00:07:29,964 --> 00:07:32,918
我虽然不是医生，但我想她有孩子了
And I'm not a doctor,
but I think she was eating for two.

227
00:07:33,092 --> 00:07:35,298
我们就像查尔斯・曼森家一样
We're like Charlie Manson family, no?

228
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:39,472
我父亲本想派其他人来的，但我想锻炼下
My father was going to send
someone else, but I'm making my bones.

229
00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:44,678
你就靠杀害那些没有还手能力的人来锻炼
You make your bones by killing someone
who can hurt you back.

230
00:07:44,854 --> 00:07:47,855
那会是谁呢？你？
And who would that be? You?

231
00:07:48,023 --> 00:07:50,182
好吧，当然是你
Well, why not?

232
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:52,435
你刚杀了你老婆
You just killed your wife.

233
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:55,019
我没杀她，是你杀的！
I didn't kill her. You did.

234
00:07:56,323 --> 00:07:59,490
但是，你想伤害我？很好
Look, you want to hurt me? Good.

235
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,653
我倒想看看你能做些什么
I want to see you try.

236
00:08:02,788 --> 00:08:04,532
杀了我吧
Get it over with.

237
00:08:04,707 --> 00:08:09,333
杀了你？你让我父亲输钱，让我的家族难堪
Over? You cost my father money,
made my family look bad.

238
00:08:09,462 --> 00:08:12,665
现在我们想把你作为一个特例对待
Now we're going to make
an extra special example out of you.

239
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,126
我们查过你的档案，没有什么有趣的东西
So, we looked into your records.
Not much to find.

240
00:08:16,343 --> 00:08:18,881
为城市的卫生系统工作
Work for city,
garbage collection, sanitation.

241
00:08:19,054 --> 00:08:22,008
收益不错，但是缺乏魅力，不是么？
Good benefits but no glamour, eh?

242
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:26,050
父母双亡，没有兄弟姐妹
Father and mother dead,
no brothers or sisters,

243
00:08:26,228 --> 00:08:28,102
这真是糟糕
which is too bad,

244
00:08:28,272 --> 00:08:30,763
我本想把他们都干掉的
because I would like
to take them from you too.

245
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,358
但是你爱你的老婆，我们知道这点
But you love your wife.
We know that.

246
00:08:37,281 --> 00:08:38,692
那么，这样子说定了：
So here's the deal.

247
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:42,033
你可以走了，不过我们会盯着你的
You're free to go,
but we will have eyes on you.

248
00:08:42,203 --> 00:08:45,619
不是一直，但是我们会在你最不希望出现的时候出现
Not always, but when
you least expect it, we'll be there.

249
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,281
任何一个你想结交的人，甚至是交谈过的
Anyone you try to make friends with
or even talk to,

250
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:50,914
反正是有过任何交集的人
other than ordering a hot dog
or something,

251
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:55,250
都会像你老婆一样因你而死
will die, like your wife,
because of you.

252
00:08:55,424 --> 00:08:57,583
当然你可以随时结束这一切！跳桥
Of course, you can always end it,
jump off a bridge,

253
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,468
卧轨
throw yourself in front of a train,

254
00:08:59,637 --> 00:09:03,172
将你的不朽的灵魂送去地狱，如果你相信这些狗屁
damn your eternal soul to hell,
if you believe in that kind of bullshit.

255
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,050
就我个人来说，我不相信
Personally, I don't.

256
00:09:05,226 --> 00:09:07,432
所以，如果我是你，我宁愿去自杀
So I'd go for it if I were you.

257
00:09:10,815 --> 00:09:13,187
但是我不是你
But I am not you.

258
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,689
感谢上帝
Thank God.

259
00:09:15,861 --> 00:09:18,269
所以做你想做的事吧
So do what you want.

260
00:09:18,447 --> 00:09:20,938
如果你明天还在这，我们会杀掉房东
If you're still here tomorrow,
we're going to kill the landlady.

261
00:09:21,117 --> 00:09:23,654
- 她叫什么名字？
- 特巴洛斯基
- What was her name?
- Tobolovsky.

262
00:09:23,828 --> 00:09:25,986
特巴洛斯基夫人
Mrs Tobolovsky.

263
00:09:26,163 --> 00:09:28,156
很好
Nice lady.

264
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,242
收拾一下吧，清洁工
Clean up the mess, garbage man.

265
00:09:36,882 --> 00:09:39,967
好了！她是你女儿，她也是美国公民
All right, she's your daughter
and she's an American citizen.

266
00:09:40,803 --> 00:09:43,923
我不会打听你们的关系，这是你们的事
I ain't gonna ask what the deal is
with her. That's your business.

267
00:09:44,807 --> 00:09:47,808
不过我想说的是，找关系是很困难的
But I'm gonna tell you,
pulling strings is hard work,

268
00:09:47,977 --> 00:09:49,934
困难的工作一般不会免费
and hard work don't come free.

269
00:09:52,481 --> 00:09:53,975
开个价吧，沃夫队长
Your price, Captain Wolf?

270
00:09:55,443 --> 00:09:57,519
中国城辖区多交20%
Chinatown precinct take goes up 20%.

271
00:09:57,695 --> 00:10:02,321
布朗克斯，布鲁克林每个月各涨10%
Bronx 121st, Brooklyn divisions,
each go up by 10%, monthly.

272
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:05,777
这个价格对于一个小女孩的护照和文书工作来说太过分了
That's a steep price for a passport
and some papers for a little girl.

273
00:10:07,204 --> 00:10:08,864
现在的日子都不好过啊
Things are tough all over.

274
00:10:14,128 --> 00:10:15,587
中国城加10%
Chinatown gets upped 10%.

275
00:10:15,755 --> 00:10:18,127
布朗克斯和布鲁克林不变
Bronx and Brooklyn will settle
for the current rate

276
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:19,923
然后我们在感受到压力的时候
and the fact
that we won't start shooting

277
00:10:20,092 --> 00:10:24,469
不会随意射杀街上的警察和警察家属
cops and their families in the streets
like dogs at the first sign of pressure.

278
00:10:26,056 --> 00:10:28,382
现在的日子都不好过啊
Things are tough all over.

279
00:10:47,369 --> 00:10:49,825
嘿，朋友，我见过你，我看过你在新泽西的拳击
Hey, man, I know you.
I saw yourfight in Jersey.

280
00:10:49,997 --> 00:10:52,749
实在是太棒了，你轻松干掉了那家伙
It was really good.
You knocked that guy out.

281
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:56,499
- 不是的
- 我有好东西，兄弟
- No.
- That was some good shit, man.

282
00:10:56,629 --> 00:10:58,621
很棒的格斗
Great fight.

283
00:11:48,347 --> 00:11:50,423
赌场呢？
The casino?

284
00:11:56,439 --> 00:11:58,680
80万整？
Exactly 800,000?

285
00:11:58,858 --> 00:12:00,850
大约80万
It's almost 800.

286
00:12:04,905 --> 00:12:06,862
我不是问你是不是大概80万
I'm not asking you if it's almost 800.

287
00:12:07,032 --> 00:12:09,025
我要准确数字
I want the exact number.

288
00:12:09,869 --> 00:12:13,238
78万5370美元
$785,370.

289
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:19,953
- 再上一周呢？
- 在亏钱
- And the week before?
- It's losing money.

290
00:13:18,687 --> 00:13:20,230
- 怎么？
- 为什么？
- What?
- Why?

291
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:24,816
因为他损害了生意，生意是件很严肃的事情
Because he was hurting business,
and business is a serious matter.

292
00:13:24,985 --> 00:13:26,563
我懂生意
I understand business.

293
00:13:26,737 --> 00:13:29,821
但是既然要杀他，为什么还要打他？
But why beat him
if you were going to kill him anyway?

294
00:13:48,426 --> 00:13:50,418
靠，靠！
Fuck you. Fuck you!

295
00:13:55,516 --> 00:13:58,089
- 你不能进来
- 我只想要些吃的！
- You can't come in the shelter.
- Just trying to get something to eat!

296
00:14:00,938 --> 00:14:04,805
赶紧睡觉！5分钟后熄灯
Wrap it up. Lights out in five.

297
00:14:06,235 --> 00:14:08,228
赶紧睡觉
Wrap it up.

298
00:14:09,196 --> 00:14:10,192
快点
Come on, guys.

299
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,700
好鞋子
Nice kicks.

300
00:14:25,713 --> 00:14:30,042
最好早上它们还在，不然你就得用耳朵穿上它们了
They'd better be here in the morning
or you'll be wearing them on your ears,

301
00:14:30,217 --> 00:14:33,384
因为我会把你的脚给扭下来
'cause I'll chew yourfeet off
at the goddamn ankles.

302
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:50,729
我真的想要双新点的鞋子，我会为你做任何事情
I could really use some new shoes, man.
I'll do whatever you want, you know?

303
00:14:52,364 --> 00:14:54,357
任何能帮你熬过晚上的事情
Whatever gets you through the night.

304
00:14:55,367 --> 00:14:58,155
- 我不能...
- 闭嘴，闭嘴！
- I just... I can't take another...
- Shut up. Shut up.

305
00:15:00,498 --> 00:15:02,823
闭嘴，拿走吧，我还有旧鞋子
Shut up and take them.
I've still got my old ones.

306
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:06,919
好好照顾你的脚
Go and get those feet looked at.

307
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:10,417
都烂掉了
Gangrene's setting in.

308
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:13,462
我会的，谢谢你，朋友
I will. Thank you, man.

309
00:15:15,096 --> 00:15:18,180
上帝保佑你，兄弟，上帝保佑你
Jesus loves you, brother.
Jesus loves you.

310
00:15:25,481 --> 00:15:28,351
熄灯了，明早七点会叫醒你们的
<i>Lights out. Wake-up call's 7am.</i>

311
00:15:28,526 --> 00:15:30,518
熄灯
<i>Lights out.</i>

312
00:15:31,362 --> 00:15:33,354
熄灯
<i>Lights out.</i>

313
00:15:50,548 --> 00:15:52,125
嘘
Shh.

314
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:54,969
梅，我有个坏消息
Mei, I have sad news.

315
00:15:56,387 --> 00:16:00,716
我听到他们在谈论…你妈妈走了
I heard them talking and...
your mother is gone.

316
00:16:03,352 --> 00:16:05,392
她两周前在医院去世了
She died two weeks ago in the hospital.

317
00:16:06,188 --> 00:16:07,980
他们不会告诉你的
They werert going to tell you,

318
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:11,149
但是我告诉你，这样子你可以为她的灵魂祈祷
but I'm telling you
so that you can pray

319
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:13,441
让她找到去天堂的路
for her soul to find its way to heaven.

320
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,901
别告诉他们，如果他们发现我告诉你…
Please don't say anything.
If they find out I told you...

321
00:16:17,074 --> 00:16:20,111
我会保密的，谢谢
I won't say anything. Thank you

322
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:27,868
所有人起床！9点前离开这里
<i>Everybody up.
Shelter needs to be cleared by 9am.</i>

323
00:16:28,043 --> 00:16:31,911
在3：30前办好今晚的床铺预定
<i>Bed reservations for tonight
need to be made by 3:30.</i>

324
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:34,711
带走所有个人物品
<i>Please remove
all your personal belongings.</i>

325
00:16:35,676 --> 00:16:38,048
所有人起床！走了！
Everybody up. Come on, let's go.

326
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,592
带好个人物品，你们知道规矩的
Take your belongings with you.
You know the drill.

327
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:10,031
那么，告诉我们发生了什么
So you wanna tell us what happened?

328
00:17:10,211 --> 00:17:12,168
有人喜欢那鞋子
Someone liked his shoes.

329
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:14,876
搞笑的家伙！你认为这是个玩笑？
Funny guy. You think this is a joke?

330
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:17,670
你们知道的，你们这帮保安有多糟糕
You know, you guys
are a hell of a crack security squad.

331
00:17:17,885 --> 00:17:20,293
你做的很对，你本来可以说些什么的
You were right here.
You could have said something.

332
00:17:20,471 --> 00:17:23,591
但是你喝醉酒忙着睡觉，是不是？
But you were too busy
sleeping off this contraband, right?

333
00:17:24,016 --> 00:17:26,009
你如果再来这个避难所
Come into this shelter again

334
00:17:26,185 --> 00:17:29,305
我就把你踹到大街上去
and I'm gonna run your raggedy ass
back out into the street.

335
00:18:53,981 --> 00:18:56,139
嘿！走路不看路的？
Hey! Watch where you're going, man.

336
00:18:56,317 --> 00:18:59,152
要不要给你点颜色瞧瞧？
You could get your ass
kicked for that, OK? Huh?

337
00:19:08,621 --> 00:19:10,613
4块5毛5
4.55.

338
00:19:14,085 --> 00:19:15,876
你没钱就得出去
If you got no money,
you gotta get out of line.

339
00:19:16,045 --> 00:19:18,037
我有钱
I got money.

340
00:19:18,923 --> 00:19:21,046
他没有钱，看看他那样子
He doesn't have any money.
Look at him.

341
00:19:21,217 --> 00:19:24,716
先生，我告诉过你，如果你没钱，你得离开，懂吗？
Mister, I told you, if you don't
have money, you have to leave, OK?

342
00:19:24,887 --> 00:19:27,010
让开，还有人在等呢
You gotta get out of line.
People are waiting.

343
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:30,257
走开，兄弟，让开
<i>Come on, buddy. You gotta go.</i>

344
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,568
- 这家伙惹麻烦了吗？
- 他疯了，长官
- This guy giving you trouble?
- He's crazy, Officer.

345
00:19:49,745 --> 00:19:52,319
- 把他带出去，好吗？
- 好的，过来，我们走
- Get him out of here, OK?
- All right, come on, let's go.

346
00:19:52,498 --> 00:19:55,949
嘿，你！过来，我们走！出去！到街上去！
Hey, you, come on. Let's go.
Out. On the street.

347
00:19:56,127 --> 00:19:58,748
哥们，如果你想当小丑，去马戏团
Let's go, funny boy. You wanna be
a clown, go join the circus.

348
00:19:58,921 --> 00:20:01,922
别在我辖区闹事，听懂了吗？
我不想在这附近再见到你，嘿！
Not in my precinct, you hear me?
I don't wanna see you around here. Hey.

349
00:20:05,428 --> 00:20:06,886
上帝啊
Jesus Christ.

350
00:20:07,054 --> 00:20:09,545
看看我抓到了谁
Look what the cat dragged in.

351
00:20:15,771 --> 00:20:17,811
不可思议
Unbelievable.

352
00:20:17,982 --> 00:20:21,066
- 看着他
- 看着他？
- Look at him.
- Look at him?

353
00:20:21,193 --> 00:20:23,186
不去闻闻？
How about the smell?

354
00:20:24,071 --> 00:20:26,064
我打电话叫大家过来
Think I'll call the boys.

355
00:20:50,389 --> 00:20:52,382
想我们吗，伙计？
You miss us, partner?

356
00:20:53,392 --> 00:20:55,136
欢迎回来
Welcome back to the force.

357
00:20:57,563 --> 00:20:58,642
梅…
Mei...

358
00:21:16,874 --> 00:21:18,867
对不起，我不能让他们抓到你
I'm sorry. I can't let them have you.

359
00:21:20,628 --> 00:21:23,498
梅！回来这里！
Mei! Get back here!

360
00:21:37,436 --> 00:21:42,145
- 日子过的怎么样，路克？
- 悲剧，不过正在变好
- How's your day been, Luke?
- Started lousy. But it's looking up.

361
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:49,613
路克・莱特，以前纽约最佳警察
Luke Wright, the Big Apple's hardest cop
once upon a time.

362
00:21:49,782 --> 00:21:52,652
什么都敢试，但你知道你真正的才能吗？
You always could take a shot.
But you know what your real talent is?

363
00:21:52,827 --> 00:21:55,496
你是个牵线人！我是说，谁会想到
You're a uniter. I mean, who'd
have thought that us and the Russkies

364
00:21:55,663 --> 00:21:57,739
我们会和俄国佬拴在一起？
would ever be on the same page
about anything?

365
00:21:57,915 --> 00:22:01,035
不是我！很高兴见到你，混蛋！
Not me. Nice to see you, rat.

366
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:05,374
自从你出卖我们，我就一直想这么做了
Been wanting to do this ever since the
day you opened your big fucking mouth!

367
00:22:08,551 --> 00:22:12,500
当我们听说德切斯基如何对付你时，我笑惨了
When we heard what Docheski did to you,
I mean, I had to laugh.

368
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,637
对于安妮我们很抱歉
I mean, we felt bad for Annie ar all.

369
00:22:14,807 --> 00:22:17,096
她知道她和谁在一起
Them's the breaks.
She knew who she was with.

370
00:22:17,268 --> 00:22:19,391
街上有流言说你回来的时候
Word come up from the street
you were back,

371
00:22:19,562 --> 00:22:21,104
我们甚至不敢相信
we couldn't believe our fucking ears.

372
00:22:21,272 --> 00:22:25,352
你为什么回来？为什么不远走高飞？
Why would you come back? Why wouldn't
you disappear somewhere far way, huh?

373
00:22:25,526 --> 00:22:27,104
比如说月球
Like the moon.

374
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:29,733
我想家了
I missed home.

375
00:22:32,616 --> 00:22:37,029
你曾是我们一员，路克，我们曾是一个团队，一个家庭
You were one of us, Luke.
We were a team. We were family.

376
00:22:37,204 --> 00:22:40,408
- 然后你扔下了我们
- 我们曾经有多风光，混蛋
- Then you threw us under the bus.
- We were kings, you son of a bitch!

377
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:43,369
现在，我们只是一群可怜虫
Now we're bunch of goddamn serfs.

378
00:22:46,922 --> 00:22:49,129
嘿，嘿，冷静，伯努瓦
Hey, hey, easy, Benoit, huh?

379
00:22:53,596 --> 00:22:55,921
当你回来的时候，我们以为你想寻死
When you came back,
we figured you wanted to die.

380
00:22:56,098 --> 00:22:59,514
我们还开了个盘口赌你怎么死，你知道的
We got a pool going on when
you're gonna end it and how, you know,

381
00:22:59,685 --> 00:23:01,429
公交，火车…
bus, train...

382
00:23:02,772 --> 00:23:04,978
我赌“找警察自杀”
I got my money on suicide by cop.

383
00:23:06,901 --> 00:23:08,940
来吧，拿好了
Come on, take it.

384
00:23:09,111 --> 00:23:12,065
来一枪，来吧
Take a shot. Come on.

385
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:14,362
安妮在等着你
Annie's waiting for you.

386
00:23:14,533 --> 00:23:17,736
问题是，你真的认为她想再见到你吗
Question is, do you really think
she wants to see you again?

387
00:23:17,912 --> 00:23:19,157
嗯？
Hmm?

388
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:23,707
其实我真正的才能是让别人输钱
Actually, my real talent
is costing other people money.

389
00:23:25,878 --> 00:23:27,954
你早就应该知道的，拉斯基
You ought to know that, Lesky.

390
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:32,460
你会输钱的，除非你朝我背后开枪
You're gonna lose that bet.
Unless you wanna shoot me in the back.

391
00:23:32,635 --> 00:23:34,627
不过对你来说也不是第一次了
Wouldrt be your first time.

392
00:23:36,472 --> 00:23:38,465
你为什么不了结这一切？
Why don't you just end it?

393
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,141
你在等什么？
What are you waiting for?

394
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:43,303
身边的人死去更多？
More people around you to die?

395
00:23:46,357 --> 00:23:47,768
你到底在等什么？
What are you waiting for?

396
00:23:49,151 --> 00:23:52,651
最后一次，告诉我那些数字
For the last time,
give me the numbers.

397
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:12,709
你是个勇敢的女孩，而且很聪明
You're a very brave girl, and clever.

398
00:24:14,969 --> 00:24:19,512
但你知道我们如何知道你的本事吗？
But do you know how we knew exactly
what you can do,

399
00:24:19,682 --> 00:24:21,721
你要在什么时间去什么地方
where you're going to be and when?

400
00:24:21,892 --> 00:24:24,383
- 有人告诉你了
- 对
- Someone told you.
- That's right.

401
00:24:25,396 --> 00:24:27,721
猜猜是谁？
Can you guess who?

402
00:24:35,322 --> 00:24:39,023
你的朋友，告诉你关于你可怜母亲事情的人
Yourfriend, the one who told you
about your poor mother

403
00:24:39,201 --> 00:24:40,993
将你从家里带走的流氓可不会告诉你那些
when the scum
who took you from home would not.

404
00:24:41,162 --> 00:24:43,997
她在帮我们做事
She's working for us with a smile.

405
00:24:44,915 --> 00:24:46,908
玲
Ling.

406
00:25:01,891 --> 00:25:03,385
讲英语
In English.

407
00:25:07,813 --> 00:25:10,221
我说了，讲英语！
I said speak in English.

408
00:25:11,192 --> 00:25:13,184
怎么样？
Well?

409
00:25:15,154 --> 00:25:17,823
她不肯告诉我任何事
She won't tell me anything.

410
00:25:20,201 --> 00:25:21,909
我的父亲很有耐心
My father is a patient man.

411
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:24,359
我没有
I am not.

412
00:25:25,706 --> 00:25:27,081
告诉他他想知道的一切
Tell him what he wants to know.

413
00:25:27,249 --> 00:25:28,625
不然我就…
Or I'II...

414
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:30,951
纽约警察！开门！
NYPD! Open the door!

415
00:25:31,128 --> 00:25:32,920
- 搞什么？
- 我们是警察
- What the hell?
- This is the police.

416
00:25:33,089 --> 00:25:36,588
我们接到报警说扰民
We got reports of a disturbance.

417
00:25:38,761 --> 00:25:42,046
你可以选择配合或者硬来
Look, you can make this easy
or you can make it hard.

418
00:25:42,223 --> 00:25:44,796
开门，不然我们就要砸门了
Open the door or we come in by force.

419
00:25:44,975 --> 00:25:45,971
放屁
Bullshit, blue.

420
00:25:46,143 --> 00:25:49,429
你敢进来就别想活着出去，我以母亲之名发誓
You come in here, you go out feet first,
I swear on my mother.

421
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,943
他们在里面，队长
Yeah, they're in there, Captain.

422
00:25:55,111 --> 00:25:59,654
他们一点都不配合，你最好在事情失控前过来
They're not cooperating. You better
get down here before things go to hell.

423
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:01,982
不行，这事闹大了
Negative, negative. This is big.

424
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,160
我马上回警局指挥，我们再联系
I'm going back to the station to monitor
the city. I'll get back to you.

425
00:26:06,288 --> 00:26:08,447
好了，我们找到她了，你知道我想要什么
All right, we got 'em pinned down.
You know what I want.

426
00:26:08,624 --> 00:26:14,460
我们有言在先，抓到女孩，可以就活捉，不行就干掉
We have a deal. Get the girl,
alive if you can, dead if you can't.

427
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:17,465
我们进去的话，布鲁克林上升10%，这是新的约定
<i>We go in, Brooklyrs take
goes up by 10%. That's the new deal.</i>

428
00:26:17,633 --> 00:26:19,958
等等，我有个电话要接
<i>Hold on, I got an incoming call.</i>

429
00:26:22,054 --> 00:26:25,221
- 嘿，埃米尔，怎么了？
- 把你的人弄走，混蛋
- Emile, what's up?
- Take your men off, Wolf.

430
00:26:25,433 --> 00:26:30,225
不管中国人给你什么，我都加5%
Whatever the Chinese offered to you,
I'll up it by 5%.

431
00:26:34,358 --> 00:26:36,149
把她带回来
Get her back here.

432
00:26:46,704 --> 00:26:47,902
好了，关
<i>All right, Quan,</i>

433
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,832
俄罗斯人提供我布鲁克林7%
<i>I got the Russians
offering to up Brooklyrs take by 7%,</i>

434
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,158
布朗克斯也一样，所以我不知道该怎么和你说
Bronx the same.
So I don't know what to tell you.

435
00:26:53,335 --> 00:26:55,458
我的手下，他们宁愿去打仗
My guys are willing
to go to war over this.

436
00:26:55,588 --> 00:26:57,995
卡在我们和俄国人之间
You're gonna be stuck between us
and the Russians like Hitler,

437
00:26:58,174 --> 00:27:01,543
就像希特勒双线作战，所以你要想清楚
fighting on two fronts,
so you better think hard about this one.

438
00:27:02,386 --> 00:27:05,304
10%，两个区域，最终提案
10%, both precincts, final offer.

439
00:27:16,025 --> 00:27:19,061
嘿，麦克，这两帮家伙都愿意
Hey, Mac. Both these bastards
are willing to pay a stiff price

440
00:27:19,236 --> 00:27:20,861
为这小姑娘出大价钱
for this little Chink girl.

441
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:24,031
- 不管她有什么，我想要
- 那我们的计划是？
<i>- Whatever she's got, I want it.
- So what's our play?</i>

442
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,655
我让俄国人放下武器，你们进去
<i>I get the Russians
to drop their guard, you go in.</i>

443
00:27:26,827 --> 00:27:29,283
如果她中枪了
<i>She catches a bullet,
I want you to take out every last one</i>

444
00:27:29,497 --> 00:27:30,991
你给我把布尔什维克的都干掉
<i>of those Bolshevik scumbags.</i>

445
00:27:32,249 --> 00:27:34,575
好的，埃米尔，你的提议不错
All right, Emile, your offer's good.

446
00:27:34,752 --> 00:27:38,002
我会让我的人撤走的，只因为我更喜欢你！
<i>I'm gonna call my guys off,
but only 'cause I like you better.</i>

447
00:27:38,172 --> 00:27:41,671
狗屁！你是个贪婪的混蛋，沃夫
Bullshit. You're a greedy bastard, Wolf.

448
00:27:41,842 --> 00:27:46,220
你的嗅觉很灵敏，你想把一切占为己有
You got the scent of something big
and now you want it all for yourself.

449
00:27:46,388 --> 00:27:50,303
不过我想在你派手下进来前告诉你些事情
But I have to tell you something before
you send your men in guns blazing.

450
00:27:51,352 --> 00:27:53,843
- 她不见了
- 你指什么，她不见了？
<i>- She's gone.
- What do you mean, she's gone?</i>

451
00:27:55,189 --> 00:27:59,566
她逃走了，你的人堵在外面我没法追她
<i>I mean she escaped, and with
all your men out there, I can't follow.</i>

452
00:27:59,735 --> 00:28:01,977
我提议在找到她之前我们停战
<i>I offeryou a truce until we find her.</i>

453
00:28:02,154 --> 00:28:04,645
我发誓，如果中国人先找到她
<i>Trust me, the Chinese find her first,</i>

454
00:28:04,824 --> 00:28:07,908
你会为此后悔一辈子的
<i>that will be a thing you regret
as long as you live.</i>

455
00:28:08,911 --> 00:28:12,245
德切斯基，她到底知道些什么？
Docheski, what does she have?

456
00:28:12,415 --> 00:28:15,036
我们说定了吗，沃夫队长？
<i>Do we have a truce, Captain Wolf?</i>

457
00:28:17,628 --> 00:28:20,201
女孩是中国人，11岁
The girl is Chinese, 11 years old.

458
00:28:20,381 --> 00:28:22,539
会说普通话和英语
She speaks Mandarin and English.

459
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:25,670
照片已经下发
A photo is being disseminated.

460
00:28:25,845 --> 00:28:29,261
找到她后直接带她去中心大街
You are to find her
and bring her straight to Centre Street.

461
00:28:34,061 --> 00:28:35,306
她在往地铁去
She's heading for subway.

462
00:29:37,374 --> 00:29:39,367
对不起，安妮
Sorry, Annie.

463
00:31:46,754 --> 00:31:49,423
俄国人的手机信号在J大街消失了
Lost my lock
on the Russian cell on Jay Street.

464
00:31:50,216 --> 00:31:54,048
听起来他们是进了地铁站
Sounds like they went into
the subway station. Manattan bound.

465
00:32:38,139 --> 00:32:39,134
嘿
Hey.

466
00:33:43,871 --> 00:33:46,991
你？那个清洁工？
You? The garbage collector?

467
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:49,408
你们的情报太糟糕了
You've got bad information.

468
00:33:49,585 --> 00:33:52,586
我从来不收垃圾
我只丢垃圾
I never collected garbage.
I disposed of it.

469
00:33:57,134 --> 00:34:00,550
别被吓得失眠了，他应得的
Don't lose sleep. He had it coming.

470
00:34:38,968 --> 00:34:39,964
你还好吗？
Are you all right?

471
00:34:43,055 --> 00:34:45,297
- 出去！出去！
- 快
- Get out! Get out!
- Move.

472
00:34:45,474 --> 00:34:47,467
没事了
It's OK.

473
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:06,528
最后目击到女孩进了J大街地铁站，红色警报
<i>Girl was last seen entering
Jay Street Station. Red alert.</i>

474
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:09,788
一旦找到，立刻带她到中央大街的沃夫队长这
<i>Once found, she needs to be brought
to Captain Wolf at Centre Street.</i>

475
00:35:09,957 --> 00:35:11,332
重复，红色警报
<i>Repeat, red alert.</i>

476
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:25,051
嘿，孩子，我们是警察
Whoa. Easy. Easy there, hon.
We're the police.

477
00:35:25,222 --> 00:35:27,049
好了没事了
Everything's all right.

478
00:35:27,224 --> 00:35:29,217
你叫什么？孩子
Hey, what's your name, hon?

479
00:35:30,102 --> 00:35:31,098
就是她
This is her.

480
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:33,097
我不知道，对我来说他们看起来都一样
I don't know. They all look alike to me.

481
00:35:33,272 --> 00:35:34,980
- 你有那照片吗？
- 有，让我看看…
- You got that picture up?
- Yeah, let me see.

482
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,650
该死的纽约
Fucking New York City.

483
00:35:45,826 --> 00:35:47,819
好久没见到某些人的话
Don't see somebody for years.

484
00:35:47,995 --> 00:35:50,486
你一天会遇到他们两次
Then you bump into them twice
in the same day.

485
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,917
我不会伤害你的，孩子
Hey, hey, hey. I'm not gonna hurt you.

486
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:06,008
你到底做了什么，孩子？
What the hell did you do, kid?

487
00:36:22,655 --> 00:36:25,110
这些追你的都是坏人
You know, those men chasing you are bad.

488
00:36:25,282 --> 00:36:27,690
你能告诉我他们为什么追你吗
You wanna tell me why they're after you?

489
00:36:27,868 --> 00:36:29,861
你懂我在说什么吗？
You understand me?

490
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,114
你会说英语吗？
Speak English?

491
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:19,204
走另一边！都是车！
The other way! Cars go the other way!

492
00:37:29,722 --> 00:37:30,801
你疯了吗？
Are you a crazy man?

493
00:37:58,334 --> 00:38:00,326
坐稳了
Hold on.

494
00:38:06,967 --> 00:38:10,004
这样下去,很多无辜的人会受伤
If this goes on, a lot of
innocent people are gonna get hurt.

495
00:38:10,179 --> 00:38:11,757
你希望那样子吗?
You want that?

496
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,718
很好！那就按我说的做
Good. Then do what I say.

497
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,220
你还好吗？
You OK?

498
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:58,893
我们走
Let's go.

499
00:38:59,061 --> 00:39:01,054
我不是5岁小孩
I'm not five years old.

500
00:39:04,191 --> 00:39:06,018
那就跟上
Then keep up

501
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:29,128
- 你们找到后又跟丢了？
- 不，队长，我们没有跟丢她
- You had her and you lost her.
- No, Captain, we didn't lose her.

502
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,580
她被抢走了
She was taken by force.

503
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,844
- 俄国人？
- 不是俄国人
<i>- The Russians?
- No, not the Russians.</i>

504
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:36,263
好吧…
Well...

505
00:39:36,432 --> 00:39:38,424
- 是路克・莱特
- 什么？
- It was Luke Wright.
- What?

506
00:39:38,601 --> 00:39:41,139
- 沃夫队长
- 等会，大卫
- Captain Wolf?
- Not now, David.

507
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,304
市长想找你，队长
The mayor wants you, Captain.

508
00:39:44,523 --> 00:39:47,014
- 把他接到2线
- 不是电话
- Put him through on two.
- He's not on the phone.

509
00:39:47,693 --> 00:39:49,650
他想让你去大厦…昨天
He wants you at the mansion, yesterday.

510
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:53,481
给您
There you go.

511
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,651
- 谢谢，伊万诺夫先生
- 谢谢
- Thank you, Mr Ivanov.
- Thank you.

512
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:11,919
伊万诺夫先生？给您，伊万诺夫先生，1012号房间
Mr Ivanov?
Here you are, Mr Ivanov. Room 1012.

513
00:40:12,093 --> 00:40:14,381
- 10楼
- 谢谢
- Tenth Floor.
- Thank you.

514
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,771
你喜欢高档酒店？
You like a nice hotel.

515
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,942
我从来没住过高档酒店
I've never stayed in a nice hotel.

516
00:40:38,911 --> 00:40:40,987
所以没人会到这种地方找我们
No one's gonna look for us in one.

517
00:40:58,097 --> 00:41:00,089
多想现在洗个澡啊
Would I love a shower right now.

518
00:41:01,016 --> 00:41:03,009
你可以洗的
You could use one.

519
00:41:07,481 --> 00:41:10,518
我大可以让俄国人把你带下列车
I could have just let those Russians
grab you on the train.

520
00:41:13,946 --> 00:41:15,820
那你为什么要救我？
Why did you save me?

521
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:21,612
我没救你…是你救了我
I didn't save you. You saved me.

522
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:24,739
我只是作为回报
I'm paying you back.

523
00:41:25,875 --> 00:41:27,417
我叫路克
My name's Luke.

524
00:41:29,795 --> 00:41:30,958
梅
Mei.

525
00:41:34,383 --> 00:41:36,376
你有父母吗，梅？
You have parents, Mei?

526
00:41:38,012 --> 00:41:40,633
- 我有父亲
- 他叫什么?
- I have a father.
- What's his name?

527
00:41:40,806 --> 00:41:42,799
张关
Chang Quan.

528
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:46,803
张关？
Chang Quan?

529
00:41:47,396 --> 00:41:50,101
如果我们是在说同一个人的话
If we're talking about the same guy,

530
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:52,765
据我所知他根本没孩子
he didn't have any kids
last time I checked.

531
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:55,102
这没道理，他不可能有像你那么大的孩子
Any made since
wouldn't be a day over three years old.

532
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,690
我是领养的
I'm adopted.

533
00:41:58,407 --> 00:42:00,400
他从老家带你来这的？
He bring you overfrom back home?

534
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:08,163
张不像是个做父亲的人
Chang isn't the fatherly type.

535
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:10,249
你为什么来这，梅？
Why are you here, Mei?

536
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,663
做会计
To count.

537
00:42:19,095 --> 00:42:22,510
你是被张的老板，那个老家伙送来的？他叫什么？
You were sent over by the old guy,
Chang's boss. What's his name?

538
00:42:22,681 --> 00:42:26,133
没有电脑，没有电子资料
Old school.
No computers, no electronic trails.

539
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,386
只有你脑子里的东西，是吗？
Just what you have
in your head, right?

540
00:42:40,616 --> 00:42:43,107
- 你知道韩礁吗？
- 我知道他
- You know Jiao Han?
- I know of him.

541
00:42:44,245 --> 00:42:47,411
他告诉了我一个数字，非常长的一个数字
He told me a number,
a very long number.

542
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:51,039
我本来要去个地方拿下个数字和指示
I was going someplace where I would get
another number and more instructions,

543
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:53,499
但是俄国人现身杀了所有人
but the Russian came and shot everyone.

544
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:56,078
之后警察又出现了，我就逃走了
Then the police came and I ran away.

545
00:42:56,257 --> 00:42:58,961
现在你知道一切了，高兴了吗？
Now you know everything.
Happiness for you?

546
00:43:02,596 --> 00:43:04,470
想回去找韩礁吗？
You wanna go back to Han Jiao?

547
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:08,886
我造成了太多麻烦
生意搞砸了
I make too much trouble. Bad business.

548
00:43:09,061 --> 00:43:11,932
事成之后，他会杀掉我，真是如意算盘
After I do what he asks, he kills me.
Good business.

549
00:43:12,106 --> 00:43:14,264
那么，这组数字是什么？
So what about this number?

550
00:43:14,442 --> 00:43:17,526
一个又长又无聊的数字，我可以告诉你
It's a long, boring number.
I can tell it to you.

551
00:43:18,446 --> 00:43:20,818
对我来说毫无意义
It wouldn't mean anything to me.

552
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:23,563
你怎么知道是一个数字而非一堆独立数字呢？
How do you know it's one number
and not a bunch of separate numbers?

553
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:30,452
你是个疯子，但是倒不蠢
You're a crazy man but not so stupid.

554
00:43:31,459 --> 00:43:34,459
这些数字对你来说有何特别吗？
Is there anything interesting to you
about these numbers?

555
00:43:34,587 --> 00:43:37,671
- 或许有点
- 为什么？
- Maybe a few of them.
- Why?

556
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,794
因为他们都是3或者7开头
Because they have a three or a seven
before them.

557
00:43:40,968 --> 00:43:42,676
所有数字都是随机的
All the numbers are random,

558
00:43:42,845 --> 00:43:47,092
但当中5个是7开头的，8个是3开头的
but five of them has a seven before
and eight of them has a three before.

559
00:43:47,266 --> 00:43:49,757
对于随机数来说这频率太高
That's too many times to be random.

560
00:43:49,935 --> 00:43:52,261
这是个密码
It's a code.

561
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,184
- 还有呢？
- 没了
- What else?
- Nothing.

562
00:43:56,609 --> 00:43:58,400
那么，这些3和7是比较有用的
So the three and the seven
are interesting

563
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:00,977
因为他们随机出现了太多次？
because they happen too many times
to be random.

564
00:44:01,822 --> 00:44:04,942
因为它们不是数字，是单词
Because they're not numbers.
They're words.

565
00:44:05,117 --> 00:44:07,489
从左到右或者从右到左
Right left or left right.

566
00:44:07,661 --> 00:44:10,865
老手法了，保险箱的密码
Old school. Combination to a safe.

567
00:44:22,218 --> 00:44:23,332
在这个酒店里？
In the hotel?

568
00:44:23,511 --> 00:44:25,135
哪？
Where?

569
00:44:43,051 --> 00:44:45,523
大概5尺11寸，褐色头发，30岁左右
About five eleven, brown hair, 30s.

570
00:44:45,658 --> 00:44:47,816
大概几小时前来的
Probably came in here
less than a few hours ago.

571
00:44:47,993 --> 00:44:49,903
先生，我们不允许透露顾客信息
Sir, we're not allowed
to discuss our guests.

572
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:52,368
那么，他确实是客人了？他入住了吗？
So he's a guest? Did he check in?

573
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:54,248
对不起，先生，我们不能…
I'm sorry, sir.
We're not at liberty to...

574
00:44:54,417 --> 00:44:56,954
他和一个中国女孩在一起，11岁
He would have been with a Chinese girl,
11 years old.

575
00:44:57,128 --> 00:44:59,963
我是她的父亲，我很担心她
I'm herfather
and I'm very worried about her.

576
00:45:00,131 --> 00:45:03,713
真抱歉，我可以帮你报警
I'm so sorry.
I can call the police for you.

577
00:45:04,427 --> 00:45:06,170
你敢报警我杀了你
Do that and I blow your brains out.

578
00:45:07,388 --> 00:45:08,384
- 现在…
- 别动
- Now...
- Don't move.

579
00:45:08,556 --> 00:45:09,836
他在哪个房间？
...what room is he in?

580
00:45:10,683 --> 00:45:12,925
哪个房间？
<i>What room is he in?</i>

581
00:45:15,855 --> 00:45:19,021
我想…他是在10楼
I think maybe
I put him on the 10th floor.

582
00:45:19,191 --> 00:45:21,184
哪个房间？
Room.

583
00:45:21,944 --> 00:45:24,186
我发誓，他没有带着一个小女孩
I swear he didn't have
a little girl with him.

584
00:45:24,363 --> 00:45:26,984
- 房间
- 我需要查一下
- Room.
- I just need to check.

585
00:45:27,158 --> 00:45:30,194
那就快查，或者我给你一枪
Then check quick
or I put a bullet in your brain.

586
00:45:30,369 --> 00:45:32,362
- 快
- 把手举起来
- Quick.
- Put your hands up.

587
00:45:34,582 --> 00:45:37,583
- 你不会想这么做的
- 把手举高让我看见
- You don't want any part of this.
- Hands up so I can see 'em.

588
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:54,724
没人可以离开这酒店
No one leaves the hotel!

589
00:45:54,894 --> 00:45:56,471
快点！
Come on!

590
00:45:56,645 --> 00:45:59,018
1012，他在1012房
1012. He's in room 1012.

591
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:01,977
我以为你说没人会到这里找我们
I thought you said
no one would look for us here.

592
00:46:02,985 --> 00:46:04,894
我把它关掉了，没人能打进来
I turned it off
so no one could call when I was...

593
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:06,399
它不需要被开着
It doesn't need to be on.

594
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:09,899
- 回去！
- 等等！
- Get back!
- Wait!

595
00:46:10,076 --> 00:46:11,653
都给我趴在地上！
Get down on the floor.

596
00:46:16,916 --> 00:46:18,244
所有人回去！
Everybody back!

597
00:46:18,417 --> 00:46:19,448
写下那些数字
Write down the numbers,

598
00:46:19,627 --> 00:46:22,332
那些3和7开头的，快！
just the ones with the three
and the seven in front of 'em, quick.

599
00:46:23,672 --> 00:46:26,508
你！过来这里！趴下！趴下！
You, get over there! Get down! Get down!

600
00:46:30,012 --> 00:46:31,506
我会想办法带你去安全的地方
I'll try to get you someplace safe.

601
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,922
如果我们分开了，别说你跟我说过什么！
We get separated,
don't tell them you told me anything.

602
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:37,634
- 梅，如果他们试图吓唬你…
- 试图？我已经被吓到了！
- Mei, if they try to scare you...
- Try? I'm so scared already.

603
00:46:37,812 --> 00:46:39,354
嗯，我也是，记住，撒谎！
Yeah, me to. Remember, lie.

604
00:46:39,522 --> 00:46:40,767
我们快到了
We're almost there.

605
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,182
如果你们看到他们下楼，小心别杀了那个女孩
If you see them downstairs,
try not to kill the girl.

606
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:53,816
进去
Back inside.

607
00:46:58,541 --> 00:47:01,245
跟上他们！我下楼去断他们退路！
Follow them!
I'm going back down to cut them off.

608
00:47:38,497 --> 00:47:40,953
警察来了，顶住他们直到我下令撤退！
The cops are here.
Hold them off until I give the word.

609
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:42,785
别让他们进来
Do not let them in!

610
00:48:11,322 --> 00:48:14,027
所有人给我趴下，你们走不了了
Everybody stay down!
You ain't going nowhere! Stay!

611
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,117
嘿！你去哪？回去！站住！蹲下！都回去！
Hey, where you going?
Get down! No! Get back down!

612
00:48:17,286 --> 00:48:20,038
- 回去！
- 快！快！
- Get back!
- Move! Move!

613
00:49:16,178 --> 00:49:18,087
起来！所有人起来！
Get up! Everybody up!

614
00:49:18,264 --> 00:49:21,134
我们要离开酒店了，起来！
We're getting out of the hotel. Up!

615
00:49:21,308 --> 00:49:24,226
站起来，不然我就开枪了！站起来！
Up or I start shooting you! Up!

616
00:49:26,522 --> 00:49:29,143
58号转角，我们发现嫌疑犯
Moving to corner of 58.
We got a suspect.

617
00:49:29,316 --> 00:49:31,558
别动！
Hey, don't move!

618
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:33,728
别动！
Don't move!

619
00:49:40,828 --> 00:49:43,401
走！往那走！
Move! Move! Over there! Go!

620
00:49:43,581 --> 00:49:48,492
到街上去，别停！谁不听话下场就是这样！
Into the street and keep moving!
Anyone who doesn't dies like this!

621
00:49:51,172 --> 00:49:52,251
到街上去
Into the street!

622
00:49:54,759 --> 00:49:57,214
重复，别开枪！
Repeat, hold your fire!

623
00:49:58,012 --> 00:49:59,210
那些都是平民！
They're civilians!

624
00:50:12,693 --> 00:50:16,691
嫌犯在人群中，嫌犯在人群中
Suspect is in the crowd.
Suspect is in the crowd.

625
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,031
嘿！给我站住！
Hey, stop right there!

626
00:50:53,609 --> 00:50:56,361
嘿，你干什么！
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

627
00:50:59,907 --> 00:51:03,193
我的车！做点什么！他抢了我的车！
That's my car!
Do something, he took my fucking car!

628
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:19,167
往市中心开，我过一会告诉你地址
Head downtown.
I'll give you an address in a minute.

629
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:38,603
靠
Shit.

630
00:51:45,786 --> 00:51:48,787
- 嘿，朋友！可以告诉我地址了吗？
- 等一下
- Hey, buddy, you wanna give me address?
- In a minute. Just hold on.

631
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:13,331
他回来了？路克・莱特回到我的城市了？
He's here? Luke Wright is back
in the city, in my city?

632
00:53:13,499 --> 00:53:15,207
他已经回来有一段时间了
<i>He's been back for a while.</i>

633
00:53:15,376 --> 00:53:17,534
- 一段时间？多久？
- 可能一年，这很难说
- A while? What's a while?
- Maybe a year. It's hard to say.

634
00:53:17,711 --> 00:53:19,751
挂掉电话！
Turn that goddamn thing off.

635
00:53:21,132 --> 00:53:23,208
- 亚历克斯
- 朋友们
- Alex.
- Guys.

636
00:53:23,384 --> 00:53:25,376
是，对不起，市长
Yes, sir. Sorry, Your Honour.

637
00:53:27,596 --> 00:53:30,087
发生了什么，沃夫？路克・莱特又是怎么卷进来的？
What's going on, Wolf?
And how's Luke Wright involved in it?

638
00:53:30,266 --> 00:53:32,342
我本来也想问你这个问题
I figured I might ask you
the same question.

639
00:53:32,518 --> 00:53:34,511
别和我玩游戏
Don't try to game me.

640
00:53:35,604 --> 00:53:37,063
你不过就是个马前卒
You're nothing but a pawn

641
00:53:37,189 --> 00:53:39,561
下着一盘你无法掌控的大棋
playing on a board so big
you can't even see the edge.

642
00:53:39,733 --> 00:53:41,607
仅此而已
That's all you've ever been.

643
00:53:41,777 --> 00:53:45,146
直到5分钟前我都比你更了解路克・莱特
I knew about Luke Wright, which is more
than you can say until five minutes ago.

644
00:53:46,741 --> 00:53:48,116
你所知的路克・莱特
What you know about Luke Wright

645
00:53:48,284 --> 00:53:51,450
还不到浩瀚资料中的一小片段
rates less than a paragraph
in a very fat book.

646
00:53:52,371 --> 00:53:53,367
世贸大厦倒下后
After the towers fell

647
00:53:53,539 --> 00:53:56,493
我们的人都分散出去追寻恐怖活动
and our manpower was spread out
tracking terrorist activity,

648
00:53:56,667 --> 00:53:58,458
是我组织了特勤队
I was the one
who formed the special task force

649
00:53:58,627 --> 00:54:00,419
惩治犯罪以填补缺口
to deal with the crime
that was filling the gap.

650
00:54:00,588 --> 00:54:04,004
别忘了也是我让你来管理这支队伍
And don't you ever fucking forget that
I was the one who put you in charge.

651
00:54:04,175 --> 00:54:06,666
我从来没忘记…我的工作成就了你的市长
I didn't forget. My work made you mayor.

652
00:54:06,844 --> 00:54:08,504
你的工作？
Your work?

653
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:11,431
你以为路克只是你警察中的一员？
You think Luke
was just one of your cops?

654
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:13,887
当我拉起队伍时，我知道它需要一面刀锋
When I put together your team,
I knew it needed an edge

655
00:54:14,101 --> 00:54:17,636
普通警探无法胜任，得像手术刀刀锋一般
no ordinary detectives could give me,
something surgical.

656
00:54:18,564 --> 00:54:22,147
我拜托那些甚至不存在于官方记录中的朋友
I called friends in places buried
so deep they don't officially exist.

657
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:26,980
他们很同情我，一周后他们送来了路克・莱特
They were sympathetic.
A week later they sent Luke Wright.

658
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:29,982
那些过去七年里消失的自作聪明的家伙
Those wise guys who vanished
over the last seven years,

659
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:32,152
你以为他们死于自相残杀？
you think that was internecine war?

660
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,409
你在哈林区排水沟里找到的可卡因
Those coke kings
you found in the gutter in Harlem.

661
00:54:35,581 --> 00:54:39,032
布鲁克林的弗雷迪・彼得罗维奇，中国城的汤米・劳
Freddy Petrovich in Brooklyn.
Tommy Lau in Chinatown.

662
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:40,918
路克・莱特是个幽灵
Luke Wright is a ghost.

663
00:54:42,046 --> 00:54:44,038
非常致命的幽灵
A very deadly ghost.

664
00:54:45,841 --> 00:54:47,834
而且工作很效率
It worked like a charm too.

665
00:54:48,677 --> 00:54:52,260
然后你们这帮混蛋就忙着捞钱了
Then you dicks had to get greedy
and pad your pockets.

666
00:54:52,431 --> 00:54:55,847
路克是个杀手，但是个诚实的杀手
Luke's a killer, but he's an honest one.

667
00:54:56,018 --> 00:54:58,509
当他威胁说要把向情报局告发一切时
When he threatened to take
the whole thing to IA,

668
00:54:58,687 --> 00:55:01,309
当时确实费了很大的劲
it took some people with a lot of bronze
stuck to their pyjamas

669
00:55:01,482 --> 00:55:02,680
才搞定他
to talk him off the ledge.

670
00:55:02,858 --> 00:55:05,563
如果我的队伍解散，我们就又变回苦力了
Yeah, my team gets dismantled.
We're peons again.

671
00:55:05,736 --> 00:55:07,147
但是如果路克・莱特有这么深背景
But if Luke Wright's so connected,

672
00:55:07,279 --> 00:55:10,031
为什么他会沦落到在泽西打拳击
how does he wind up in Jersey
cage fighting on the B circuit?

673
00:55:11,158 --> 00:55:13,317
我看起来像心理医生吗？
Do I look like a shrink?

674
00:55:13,494 --> 00:55:15,700
动员起所有人来
Get everybody on this.

675
00:55:15,871 --> 00:55:17,531
一旦路克・莱特有了目标
Once Luke Wright gets on a roll,

676
00:55:17,706 --> 00:55:19,699
整个城市只有一个人能在
一对一中和他抗衡
only one man in this city
can take him on one-on-one.

677
00:55:19,875 --> 00:55:20,990
打扰了,我知道我不该打扰你们
I know this is a closed door,

678
00:55:21,168 --> 00:55:25,083
但是市中心一座酒店发生了大规模枪战
but there was just a major gun battle
downtown at a hotel.

679
00:55:25,256 --> 00:55:28,173
媒体都疯了,您需要赶紧做一份声明
Media's going nuts.
You're gonna need to make a statement.

680
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,967
韩礁现在也在城里
Han Jiao is in the city also.

681
00:55:32,179 --> 00:55:35,513
他给了那个中国女孩一些东西,我不知道的东西
He give this little Chinese girl
something, I don't know what.

682
00:55:35,683 --> 00:55:37,307
路克・莱特在我之前带走了她
Luke Wright grabbed her before I could.

683
00:55:37,476 --> 00:55:38,674
- 什么？
- 我说路克・莱特
- What?
- I said Luke Wright...

684
00:55:38,853 --> 00:55:41,391
知道了，我一开始就听到了
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I heard you the first time.

685
00:55:45,526 --> 00:55:47,020
关闭曼哈顿的每一个出口
Close every exit out of Manattan.

686
00:55:47,194 --> 00:55:50,729
确保莱特和那个女孩逃不出去
Make sure that neither Wright or the
girl gets away, you get commissioner.

687
00:55:50,906 --> 00:55:55,236
放跑了...你就找把铲子自掘坟墓吧
Let 'em go... you get a shovel
to dig your own grave.

688
00:55:56,495 --> 00:55:59,117
那个女孩绝不能离开这个城市
That girl does not leave this city.

689
00:57:08,734 --> 00:57:11,688
我们找到了女孩，但是信息可能已经被泄漏
We recovered the girl, but the
information might have been compromised.

690
00:57:11,862 --> 00:57:14,353
- 我们要改下时间表吗？
- 不可能
<i>- Should we change our time frame?
- lmpossible.</i>

691
00:57:14,532 --> 00:57:16,690
现在整件事情已经失控了
Now that the whole damn thing
has gone supernova,

692
00:57:16,867 --> 00:57:19,074
今晚一定要了结此事
it's going to happen
and it's gonna happen tonight.

693
00:57:19,286 --> 00:57:20,829
会面地点要改下
But the meeting place
needs to be changed.

694
00:57:20,996 --> 00:57:23,570
- 到哪？
- 我会告诉你的
- Where to?
- I'll let you know.

695
00:57:23,749 --> 00:57:25,742
这里！就这里！
Here. Right here.

696
00:57:31,298 --> 00:57:34,465
慢点，停车
Slow down. Stop the car.

697
00:57:34,635 --> 00:57:37,969
不行，不行，别把妓女带上我的车子
No, no, you don't bring
no hookers in my cab, man.

698
00:57:39,223 --> 00:57:41,216
继续打你的表
Just keep the meter running.

699
00:57:45,229 --> 00:57:47,435
小姐们
Ladies.

700
00:57:47,606 --> 00:57:49,599
去喝一杯如何？
How about a drink?

701
00:57:57,158 --> 00:57:59,150
晚上好
Good evening.

702
00:57:59,326 --> 00:58:01,153
- 晚上好
- 想在这里吃晚餐吗？
- Evening.
- Will you be joining us for dinner?

703
00:58:01,328 --> 00:58:03,902
- 我们没有预定
- 没事的
- We don't have a reservation.
- That's OK.

704
00:58:04,081 --> 00:58:07,865
今晚虽然很忙，但是我们应该能给你们找到位置
We're busy tonight, but we should
be able to find you something.

705
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:12,919
楼下已经没有空位了，不过背后还有些
We don't have any tables downstairs,
but there are some in the back.

706
00:58:14,091 --> 00:58:16,582
或者如果你们喜欢的话，去楼上也可以
Or you could sit upstairs if you like.

707
00:58:23,392 --> 00:58:27,721
先生？您怎么看？先生？
Sir? Sir?
Do you have a preference? Sir?

708
00:58:27,897 --> 00:58:29,439
我们就在吧台喝点酒
I think we'll just get a drink
at the bar.

709
00:58:33,277 --> 00:58:35,483
你亲我一下然后转身出去
I want you to give me a kiss,
turn round and walk out of here.

710
00:58:35,654 --> 00:58:38,359
- 但是我以为
- 就像你忘记了什么东西一样
- But I thought...
- Just act like you forgot something.

711
00:58:38,491 --> 00:58:39,901
只是不要再回来了
Only don't come back.

712
00:58:52,296 --> 00:58:55,795
来杯白俄罗斯，还有把叉子
Give me a white Russian, please,
and a fork.

713
00:58:55,966 --> 00:58:58,374
- 叉子？
- 就那样的
- Fork?
- One of those.

714
00:59:35,548 --> 00:59:37,955
他开的什么车？停在哪？
What does he drive
and where is it parked?

715
00:59:40,678 --> 00:59:42,920
外面小路上的一辆银色的SUV
A silver SUV in the alley outside.

716
00:59:57,611 --> 01:00:00,281
- 瓦西里
- 打错了
<i>- Vassily.
- Not even close.</i>

717
01:00:01,782 --> 01:00:02,778
你是谁？
Who is this?

718
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:05,073
整晚都在屠戮你手下的人，埃米尔
The guy who's been
killing your boys all night, Emile.

719
01:00:05,244 --> 01:00:08,364
你的儿子在我手里
The guy who has your son tied up
in a very dark place.

720
01:00:09,331 --> 01:00:10,327
听好，我想要…
Now, here's what I want.

721
01:00:10,499 --> 01:00:12,124
你以为我会关心你想要什么？
<i>You think I give a shit
of what you want?</i>

722
01:00:12,293 --> 01:00:14,618
你以为抓了瓦西里就能敲诈我？
Do you think you can blackmail me
because you have Vassily?

723
01:00:14,795 --> 01:00:17,500
- 杀了他，下地狱去吧
- 我会下地狱的
<i>- Kill him and go to hell.
- I'm going to hell all right.</i>

724
01:00:17,673 --> 01:00:19,998
不过我不会杀了你儿子
<i>But I'm not gonna kill your boy.</i>

725
01:00:20,176 --> 01:00:22,667
我会把他带在身边，就像宠物一样
<i>I'm gonna keep him around, like a pet.</i>

726
01:00:22,845 --> 01:00:25,514
我对待宠物可不友善
A very badly treated pet.

727
01:00:25,681 --> 01:00:27,590
我会做一些让我以后每次照镜子
I'm gonna do things to him
that'll make me ashamed

728
01:00:27,767 --> 01:00:30,886
都觉得屈辱的事情，但是我会这么做的
<i>to look in the mirror afterward,
but I will do them.</i>

729
01:00:31,604 --> 01:00:35,055
瓦西里会告诉我所有他所知道的
<i>Vassily's gonna tell me everything
he knows about your operation.</i>

730
01:00:35,232 --> 01:00:37,902
然后你准备怎么做？报警？
And then what you gonna do?
Tell the police?

731
01:00:38,944 --> 01:00:42,396
- 你在搞笑吗？
- 我之前有提到过警察吗？
- You want me to laugh?
- Who said anything about the police?

732
01:00:42,573 --> 01:00:44,731
我会把这些信息与你的竞争对手分享
I'm gonna share the information
with the competition,

733
01:00:44,909 --> 01:00:46,569
我还没干掉的那些家伙
the ones I haven't already killed.

734
01:00:46,744 --> 01:00:49,199
我会拿光你所有的东西
<i>Anything they don't take from you,
I will.</i>

735
01:00:49,371 --> 01:00:52,657
首先我会带走你漂亮的老婆
<i>First I'm gonna take your trophy wife.</i>

736
01:00:52,833 --> 01:00:55,787
然后是你的孩子们
<i>Then I'm gonna take
your trophy children.</i>

737
01:00:55,961 --> 01:00:57,504
我会让你一无所有
<i>I'm gonna leave you with nothing.</i>

738
01:00:57,630 --> 01:01:00,121
当我完事后，你就什么都不是了
When I'm done, you won't even be
a memory of a memory.

739
01:01:01,342 --> 01:01:04,711
- 不过这些都没必要发生
- 你想要什么？
<i>- But that doesn't have to happen.
- What do you want?</i>

740
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:07,921
- 我想知道保险箱里有什么
- 什么保险箱？
- I wanna know what's in the safe.
- What safe?

741
01:01:08,099 --> 01:01:11,218
那个女孩给我密码的那个保险箱
The safe the girl gave me
the combination to. That safe.

742
01:01:13,521 --> 01:01:15,513
三千万美元
<i>$30 million.</i>

743
01:01:17,191 --> 01:01:20,062
那孩子本来要去拿第二个密码，第二个保险箱里有什么？
Kid was on her way to get a second
number. What's in the second safe?

744
01:01:21,112 --> 01:01:24,730
值三千万美元的东西
<i>Something won'th $30 million.</i>

745
01:01:24,907 --> 01:01:27,232
- 给谁？
- 不知道
<i>- To who?
- No idea.</i>

746
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:31,075
那是因为你只有小聪明，埃米尔
That's 'cause
you're only half-smart, Emile.

747
01:01:33,249 --> 01:01:34,992
那么，我们这么说定了…
So here's the deal.

748
01:01:35,167 --> 01:01:37,872
你告诉我第一个保险箱在哪，我拿了钱就放你儿子
You tell me where the first safe is,
I take the money and let your boy go.

749
01:01:38,045 --> 01:01:40,797
骗我的话你就死定了，说到做到
<i>Lie to me and yourworld ends.
You have my word on that.</i>

750
01:01:40,965 --> 01:01:45,009
白痴！我知道一个人是否独行
Idiot. I know
when a man is working alone

751
01:01:45,177 --> 01:01:47,633
而你正好只身一人
and you're as alone as one can be.

752
01:01:47,805 --> 01:01:50,722
你需要一支队伍才能靠近保险箱
You need a small army
to get near that safe,

753
01:01:50,891 --> 01:01:53,050
我有这种队伍
the kind of army I have.

754
01:01:53,227 --> 01:01:57,177
曾经有过！我时间不多
Had. It's been shrinking by the minute.

755
01:01:58,441 --> 01:02:01,228
最后一次机会，否则我就挂电话修理你儿子了
<i>Last chance before I hang up
and go to work on your son.</i>

756
01:02:05,865 --> 01:02:07,857
你要杀我吗，收垃圾的？
Going to kill me, garbage man?

757
01:02:09,452 --> 01:02:12,737
你那天就可以把我们都干掉的，是吗？
You could have taken us out that day,
couldn't you?

758
01:02:12,913 --> 01:02:15,036
但是你只是跪在那里
But you just sat there,

759
01:02:15,207 --> 01:02:17,912
让我们毁掉你，让你变得一无是处
let us ruin you,
let us make you nothing.

760
01:02:18,085 --> 01:02:22,213
我猜是保险箱给了你新的动力，是吗，收垃圾的？
I guess finding out about that safe gave
you new motivation, eh garbage man?

761
01:02:23,424 --> 01:02:25,831
如果我是你就不会浪费口舌
I wouldn't spend my time talking
if I were you.

762
01:02:26,594 --> 01:02:30,923
会祈祷事情结束时，那小女孩还活着
Spend it praying that when this is over
that little girl's still alive.

763
01:02:34,769 --> 01:02:36,761
祈祷！
Pray.

764
01:02:45,029 --> 01:02:46,025
时间地点？
When and where?

765
01:02:46,197 --> 01:02:49,281
桥下的地下道，一小时后
<i>The underpass under the bridge,
one hour.</i>

766
01:02:53,079 --> 01:02:56,993
对不起，那些俄国人出现时我用枪指着你
I'm sorry I pointed a gun at you
when the Russians attacked us, Mei.

767
01:02:58,417 --> 01:03:00,374
- 那只是…
- 生意而已…我知道的
- It was...
- Business. I know.

768
01:03:00,544 --> 01:03:02,952
很好，很好，你理解
It's good. It's good you understand.

769
01:03:03,130 --> 01:03:05,206
我们会搞定这一切
We're going to get this done

770
01:03:05,382 --> 01:03:07,624
然后你跟我和韩叔一起就安全了
and you'll be safe
with me and Uncle Han.

771
01:03:09,428 --> 01:03:10,970
我保证做一个好父亲
I promise to be a better father to you

772
01:03:11,138 --> 01:03:13,297
比那个抛弃你和你母亲的家伙更好
than the one
who left you and your mother.

773
01:03:17,061 --> 01:03:19,730
这个世界上没人比我更关心你
There's no one in the world
who cares more about you.

774
01:03:21,065 --> 01:03:23,271
你知道的，是吗？
You know that, don't you?

775
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,969
人都到了
Well, the gang's all here.

776
01:03:55,141 --> 01:03:56,932
差不多
Almost.

777
01:03:57,101 --> 01:04:00,351
- 伯尼生病了？
- 他在医院，混蛋！
- Reddick have to call in sick?
- He's in the hospital, dickhead.

778
01:04:00,521 --> 01:04:04,222
- 你打坏了他的气管
- 我从来不知道气管还能被打坏
- You broke his trachea.
- I didn't know a trachea could break.

779
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,357
- 希望他们能修好
- 是吗！不如让我先修理你？
- Hope they can fix it.
- Yeah? How about I fix you?

780
01:04:06,527 --> 01:04:09,100
嘿！嘿！嘿！嘿！别这样！
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Not here.

781
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:13,774
好久不见，路克，不过我并不想念你
It's been a while, Luke.
Can't say I missed you.

782
01:04:15,286 --> 01:04:19,118
- 那么，有话直说吧
- 带了我要的东西没？
- So, let's get down to business.
- Did you bring what I asked for?

783
01:04:23,544 --> 01:04:25,786
- 托斯卡尼的
- 还有呢？
- Toscanni's.
- Where else?

784
01:04:42,730 --> 01:04:45,137
味道不错！
Mmm. That's good.

785
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:01,573
我整晚都在餐馆里
Been in restaurants all night.

786
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:04,659
但是他们提供给我的都是子弹
All I got served was lead.

787
01:05:10,966 --> 01:05:13,920
- 有火吗？
- 去你的！
- Anyone got a light?
- You know what? Screw this.

788
01:05:14,095 --> 01:05:16,550
听着，队长，你让我们过来，我们过来了
Look, Captain, you asked us
to come here, so we came.

789
01:05:16,764 --> 01:05:19,385
但我不会站在这里听这混蛋胡扯
But I ain't gonna sit here
and listen to this scumbag's big mouth.

790
01:05:19,558 --> 01:05:21,551
闭嘴，科夫克斯！
Shut up, Kolfax.

791
01:05:22,144 --> 01:05:24,682
还没戒烟，哈？
Still haven't quit, huh?

792
01:05:35,157 --> 01:05:37,779
嘿，嘿，这是什么？
Hey. Hey, what the hell is that?

793
01:05:37,952 --> 01:05:39,944
装有三千万美元保险箱的密码
Combination of the safe
with 30 million bucks in it.

794
01:05:40,121 --> 01:05:42,612
- 哇，哇！你在干嘛？
- 你个狗屎
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Filthy piece of shit.

795
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:45,707
现在这密码存在我脑子里了
The only place it exists now is in here.

796
01:05:45,876 --> 01:05:48,414
当你们手痒想扣扳机时，记住这点
Remember that next time
your little triggerfinger gets itchy.

797
01:05:48,587 --> 01:05:49,832
为什么韩礁会把它藏在
Why would Han Jiou stash it

798
01:05:50,005 --> 01:05:52,579
中国城最繁忙的赌窝里？
right in the middle of Chinatowrs
busiest gambling den?

799
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,958
因为伯努瓦这样的喜欢
Because of sleaze-bucket cops
like you, Benoit,

800
01:05:55,136 --> 01:05:57,674
去赌窝收保护费腐败警察
who collect off of Chinatowrs
busiest gambling den.

801
01:05:57,847 --> 01:06:00,254
想不吸引警察的注意
Where else would he surround it
with dozens of armed man

802
01:06:00,433 --> 01:06:02,010
他还能放在哪里？
without attracting police attention?

803
01:06:02,184 --> 01:06:05,636
队长,我们怎么知道这混蛋不是在玩我们？他是个流浪汉！
Captain, why do we know this son of
a bitch on the level, huh? He's a bum.

804
01:06:05,813 --> 01:06:07,806
你从哪得到的消息？
Where'd you get your information?

805
01:06:08,732 --> 01:06:10,809
今晚会有个交易
There's an exchange happening tonight.

806
01:06:10,943 --> 01:06:13,101
三合会半数交易额都在赌场保险箱里
The Triad half of the deal
is in a safe in the casino.

807
01:06:13,279 --> 01:06:16,944
我一人搞不定，所以我叫了你们，老朋友们
No way I could get to it on my own,
so I called on you, my old pals.

808
01:06:18,325 --> 01:06:20,816
三千万美元分六份依然是很大一笔钱
30 million split six ways
is still a lot of money.

809
01:06:23,622 --> 01:06:27,537
我们风险太大，队长，尤其是你
We're risking a lot, Captain.
You especially.

810
01:06:27,710 --> 01:06:30,283
所有人都知道你前途光明
Everybody knows you got a bright future.

811
01:06:30,463 --> 01:06:33,417
谁保证的？你的市长？
Promised by who? His Honour?

812
01:06:33,591 --> 01:06:36,295
他跟你承诺什么了，沃夫？
What carrot
is he teasing you with, Wolf?

813
01:06:36,469 --> 01:06:38,841
若他知道你所掌握的，他还会放过你？
He's gonna let you out in the street
knowing what you know now?

814
01:06:39,013 --> 01:06:40,175
你什么意思？
What's that supposed to mean?

815
01:06:40,347 --> 01:06:43,218
意思是，他的第二任期快到头了，什么保证都是屁
His second term is gonna come to an end
and his hold on the city goes poof.

816
01:06:43,392 --> 01:06:45,848
就跟普通公民一样
Just like that he's Joe Citizen again.

817
01:06:45,978 --> 01:06:48,267
三千万是一笔不错的退休金
30 million would be
a nice retirement package.

818
01:06:48,439 --> 01:06:49,684
他给中国佬什么好处？
What's he giving the Chinks?

819
01:06:49,857 --> 01:06:53,724
如果我知道，还会跟你们这帮混蛋站在这里？
If I knew that, I wouldn't be standing
here with you assholes, would I?

820
01:06:55,446 --> 01:06:57,023
光明未来，哈？
A bright future, huh?

821
01:06:57,198 --> 01:06:58,906
头条
Big headlines.

822
01:06:59,075 --> 01:07:02,526
“英雄警察破获纽约最大的地下赌博巢穴”
"Hero cops take down New York City's
biggest underground gambling operation."

823
01:07:02,703 --> 01:07:05,704
每人五百万美元，且没人知道
Five million bucks apiece
that no one will ever know about,

824
01:07:05,873 --> 01:07:08,162
就当是额外甜头
just to give it that extra sweet taste.

825
01:07:26,018 --> 01:07:29,968
好了，谁进去过？拜托，谁进去过？
All right, who's been in there?
For Christ's sake, who's been in there?

826
01:07:30,147 --> 01:07:32,472
- 我，队长
- 你俩做先锋
- Me, Cap.
- You two, you're on point.

827
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:35,437
里面都是平民，看准了打
Place is packed with civilians,
so exercise some judgement.

828
01:07:35,611 --> 01:07:37,734
记住只有我有密码
Remember, I got the combination.

829
01:07:37,905 --> 01:07:40,147
如果你们想要钱，掩护好我
You want that money, watch my back.

830
01:07:57,508 --> 01:07:59,584
你要去哪？
Where are you going?

831
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,547
别动！待着！
Don't move! Stay!

832
01:08:16,444 --> 01:08:17,819
让开！走！
Out of the way! Move!

833
01:08:35,504 --> 01:08:36,963
嘿，你，去死吧！
Hey, you, settle down!

834
01:08:49,226 --> 01:08:50,424
这里！走！
This way. Let's go.

835
01:09:35,064 --> 01:09:36,344
小心
Heads up.

836
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:46,863
走
Go.

837
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,043
科夫克斯，干掉他
Kolfax, take him out.

838
01:10:06,554 --> 01:10:08,262
掩护他
Cover him.

839
01:10:50,765 --> 01:10:52,591
打开它，开枪！
Open it. Take it!

840
01:10:54,351 --> 01:10:55,727
靠！
Oh, shit!

841
01:11:15,539 --> 01:11:17,449
靠！我必须离开这里
Oh, shit.
I gotta get out of here.

842
01:11:17,625 --> 01:11:20,579
操，操，队长
Oh, fuck. Fuck, Captain.

843
01:11:23,047 --> 01:11:26,416
天啊，你个混蛋！你杀了同伴，你个混蛋！
God, you shit!
Shoot a man in the back, son of a bitch!

844
01:11:27,301 --> 01:11:30,421
- 好了，米尔斯，我们往哪走？
- 这里
- All right, Mears, where we going?
- This way.

845
01:11:31,305 --> 01:11:33,132
快
Move.

846
01:12:12,847 --> 01:12:15,420
- 天堂之门到了
- 把我们这样的罪人拒之门外
- The gates of paradise.
- Locked and bolted to sinners like us.

847
01:12:15,599 --> 01:12:18,517
好了，别浪费时间
Yeah, well,
let's not wait for an invitation.

848
01:12:41,459 --> 01:12:43,997
好了，你个混蛋，快点开始
All right, you bastard. Get started.

849
01:12:52,553 --> 01:12:54,676
下面按我说的做
Here's how we do this.

850
01:12:54,847 --> 01:12:57,883
你们先放下枪，我再开保险箱
You put down your guns, I open the safe.

851
01:12:59,226 --> 01:13:01,515
如果你们想杀我，随意
If you wanna shoot me, go ahead.

852
01:13:01,687 --> 01:13:04,937
快点决定，真警察马上就要到了
Make your minds up quick
'cause the real cops'll be here soon.

853
01:13:07,777 --> 01:13:09,686
放到地上
On the floor.

854
01:13:44,271 --> 01:13:46,347
快点，你个混蛋，你想干什么？
Come on, you son of a bitch.
What are you trying to pull?

855
01:13:46,524 --> 01:13:49,275
密码左右方向反了，马上就开了
I had right left switched.
It's gonna open.

856
01:14:06,961 --> 01:14:08,123
你会活着的
You'll live.

857
01:14:10,965 --> 01:14:12,957
左26
Left 26.

858
01:14:29,358 --> 01:14:31,149
沃夫队长，这里发生了什么？
Captain Wolf,
what the hell happened in here?

859
01:14:31,318 --> 01:14:34,070
你以为发生了什么，哈？我们突袭了这里
What do you think happened, huh?
We had a raid on the place go bad.

860
01:14:34,238 --> 01:14:36,396
有人员伤亡，赶紧给我进去处理
We got dead cops, casualties.
Get in there, will you?

861
01:14:36,574 --> 01:14:39,195
- 沃夫队长，你需要救护车
- 我需要一排救护车
- Captain Wolf, you need an ambulance.
- I need a fleet of ambulances.

862
01:14:39,368 --> 01:14:42,239
赶紧叫救护车，懂吗？我自己开去医院
Call it in, will you? I'll take
my own busted ass to the hospital.

863
01:14:45,374 --> 01:14:46,868
演技不错
Not bad.

864
01:14:47,042 --> 01:14:49,830
如果你不是个两面派，我几乎都喜欢上你了
If you werert such a double-dealing
asshole, I could almost like you.

865
01:14:50,004 --> 01:14:52,459
是几乎！开车！
Almost. Drive.

866
01:14:57,636 --> 01:14:59,261
只是划伤
It's a scratch.

867
01:15:02,558 --> 01:15:06,342
我不会杀你，但我可没说让你住大酒店
I'm not gonna kill you, but I didn't say
I was putting you up at the Ritz.

868
01:15:14,695 --> 01:15:16,189
沃夫
Wolf.

869
01:15:16,363 --> 01:15:18,356
我需要钱，丹尼
<i>I have your money, Danny.</i>

870
01:15:20,117 --> 01:15:21,113
什么？
What?

871
01:15:22,828 --> 01:15:24,488
你听见了
You heard me.

872
01:15:24,663 --> 01:15:28,032
三千万！五千份一千美元的支票
30 million. Five-thousand
and one-thousand dollar bills.

873
01:15:28,209 --> 01:15:29,952
- 我想谈谈
- 不行
<i>- I wanna talk.
- No.</i>

874
01:15:30,127 --> 01:15:32,535
你需要的是冷静下来我们好谈点正常的
No, what you wanna do is calm down
so we can talk like adults.

875
01:15:32,713 --> 01:15:34,373
闭嘴，丹尼
<i>Shut it, Danny.</i>

876
01:15:34,507 --> 01:15:36,630
我是想谈，不过不是和你谈
<i>I wanna talk,
but I don't wanna talk to you.</i>

877
01:15:36,801 --> 01:15:38,259
我要和你男朋友谈
<i>I wanna talk to your boyfriend.</i>

878
01:15:42,681 --> 01:15:44,389
我是亚历克斯
This is Alex.

879
01:15:44,517 --> 01:15:46,972
好久不见，亚历克斯
<i>Been a while, Alex.</i>

880
01:15:47,144 --> 01:15:49,552
- 你怎么拿到这号码的？
- 别这样，亚历克斯
- How'd you get this number?
- Come on, Alex.

881
01:15:49,730 --> 01:15:51,853
顺着市长的味就能找到你
Reach up the mayor's ass, there you are.

882
01:15:54,068 --> 01:15:56,475
男人就该有男人样，哈？
A mars gotta do
what a mars gotta do, huh?

883
01:15:56,654 --> 01:15:58,730
他总比安妮这诱饵好
He's a better catch
than Annie was anyway.

884
01:15:58,906 --> 01:16:02,240
我一直不解你为什么会勾搭上那样一头奶牛
<i>I never understood
how you hooked up with a cow like that.</i>

885
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:05,079
绝不是因为她的长相，而是她的幽默感
It was never about her looks.
It was her sense of humour.

886
01:16:05,246 --> 01:16:07,452
她现在没那么搞笑了，不是么？
She's not so funny now, is she?

887
01:16:07,623 --> 01:16:10,114
不是了，我也一样
No, she's not. Neither am I.

888
01:16:12,044 --> 01:16:14,831
我拿到了钱，亚历克斯，我杀了很多人才弄到的
I have the money, Alex.
I had to kill a lot of people to get it.

889
01:16:15,005 --> 01:16:16,416
所以听着
<i>So listen up.</i>

890
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:21,050
你还没交换过密码，另一个保险箱里是什么？
You haven't made the combination
exchange yet. What's in the other safe?

891
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:23,711
一张碟片
A disc.

892
01:16:23,889 --> 01:16:26,463
名字，钱的来龙去脉…
Names, money trails.

893
01:16:26,642 --> 01:16:29,643
当指挥官派我们帮丹尼清理城市时
<i>When our commanders sent the two of us
to help Danny clean up the city,</i>

894
01:16:29,812 --> 01:16:30,843
他们附加了一个条件
<i>they attached a price.</i>

895
01:16:31,021 --> 01:16:32,564
作为交换，丹尼要自寻财路
In exchange, Danny looked the other way

896
01:16:32,731 --> 01:16:35,685
而每笔被当做恐怖组织查抄的集团资金
while the assets seized from every group
deemed a terrorist organisation

897
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:37,733
则装进了他们的私人腰包
were funnelled
into their private accounts.

898
01:16:37,903 --> 01:16:39,481
惊讶是他们受惊需要保护时
<i>Amazing what people
let you get away with</i>

899
01:16:39,655 --> 01:16:41,564
却把你赶走了
<i>when they're scared
and wanna feel protected.</i>

900
01:16:41,741 --> 01:16:43,567
惊讶的是有那么多小人
Amazing how many scumbags
there are out there

901
01:16:43,743 --> 01:16:45,320
都等着乘机牟利
waiting to take advantage of it.

902
01:16:45,494 --> 01:16:47,119
- 难道你没有么？
- 我退出了
<i>- Like you didn't?
- I quit.</i>

903
01:16:47,288 --> 01:16:50,289
你以为这能帮那些被你私自送去见上帝的人
Bet that helps all those souls you sent
to meet their maker without due process

904
01:16:50,458 --> 01:16:51,620
省下很多功夫吗？
rest a whole lot easier.

905
01:16:51,792 --> 01:16:53,749
你以为你在拳击场上
<i>You thought you could atone
by climbing into a cage</i>

906
01:16:53,919 --> 01:16:55,995
被人随意殴打就能赎罪吗？
<i>and allowing yourself
to get beaten to a pulp?</i>

907
01:16:56,172 --> 01:16:57,915
别给我说教了，路克！
<i>Don't fucking preach at me, Luke.</i>

908
01:16:58,090 --> 01:17:00,842
我只是收钱办事
I'm getting paid for services rendered.

909
01:17:01,010 --> 01:17:05,470
是啊，你把碟片卖给中国人好让他们勒索我们上司
<i>Right. You sell the disc to the Chinese
so they can blackmail our old honchos,</i>

910
01:17:05,639 --> 01:17:09,340
然后拿着三千万美元和丹尼去巴哈马别墅逍遥自在
<i>take the 30 mill and waltz off
with Danny to a villa in the Bahamas.</i>

911
01:17:09,518 --> 01:17:12,056
是巴厘岛，不过无所谓了，不是么？
Bali, but whatever, right?

912
01:17:12,229 --> 01:17:15,266
那么，就算你知道了，又如何？
So, now you know. Now what?

913
01:17:15,483 --> 01:17:17,274
现在你要应付我
<i>Now you're dealing with me.</i>

914
01:17:17,485 --> 01:17:20,023
- 好吧，我退出
- 不行
<i>- All right, I'm turning around.
- No, you're not.</i>

915
01:17:21,238 --> 01:17:23,860
你说什么？你已经拿到钱了
What are you talking about?
You've got the money.

916
01:17:24,033 --> 01:17:28,327
- 中国人手里没有我要的了
- 不，他们有我想要的
<i>- The Chinese have nothing I care about.
- No. They have something I do.</i>

917
01:17:46,847 --> 01:17:50,512
把你保险箱密码给这女孩，她会给你我们的
Give the girl the combination to your
safe and she will give you our number.

918
01:17:50,684 --> 01:17:52,511
我们到你的地方，你去我们的
We go to your location, you go to ours.

919
01:17:52,645 --> 01:17:55,978
当我们拿到碟片，我们会给你解密密码
When we've gotten the disc,
we will explain the code

920
01:17:56,148 --> 01:17:57,346
你拿到你的钱
and you'll get the cash.

921
01:17:58,150 --> 01:18:00,143
一言为定
That's the deal.

922
01:18:00,903 --> 01:18:04,023
- 说说看吧
- 这是个很长的数字
- Let's hear it.
- It's a very long number.

923
01:18:04,198 --> 01:18:06,689
你最好能记下来
You'll want to write it down.

924
01:18:06,867 --> 01:18:08,824
感谢上帝我还带了笔，哈？
Thank goodness I brought a pen, huh?

925
01:18:18,754 --> 01:18:20,414
你最好闭上眼睛
You might wanna close your eyes.

926
01:18:22,675 --> 01:18:24,134
随你便吧
Have it your way.

927
01:18:36,564 --> 01:18:38,556
快接，路克
Come on, Luke.

928
01:18:40,776 --> 01:18:43,184
老地方，就你和我
<i>The old place, just you and me.</i>

929
01:18:46,031 --> 01:18:47,442
你是路克的朋友吗？
You're a friend of Luke?

930
01:18:50,077 --> 01:18:52,153
这不是你该关心的
Not as far as you're concerned.

931
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:06,458
今晚席卷整个纽约的暴力活动
<i>The violence
that has rocked the city tonight</i>

932
01:19:06,635 --> 01:19:08,011
依旧持续，不到一小时前
<i>continued in a bloody gun battle</i>

933
01:19:08,179 --> 01:19:11,133
中国城一家夜总会爆发了血腥枪战
<i>in a Chinatown nightclub
less than an hourago.</i>

934
01:19:11,307 --> 01:19:13,595
- 这已经完全失控了
- 你以为呢？
- This is really getting out of hand.
- You think?

935
01:19:13,726 --> 01:19:15,765
谢谢提醒
Thanks for that insight.

936
01:19:15,936 --> 01:19:18,771
市长，亚历克斯・罗瑟斯在你私人专线上
Your Honour,
Alex Rosers on your private line.

937
01:19:18,939 --> 01:19:20,434
他说有急事
He says that it's urgent.

938
01:19:20,608 --> 01:19:23,941
- 打扰一下，市长
- 我5分钟后回来，现在别烦我
- Excuse me, Your Honour.
- Back in five. Don't bother me now.

939
01:19:24,111 --> 01:19:26,318
他为什么不打我手机？
Why didn't he call me on my cellphone?

940
01:19:26,489 --> 01:19:29,406
我记得让你把所有电话都接到我的…
I thought I told you to put
all my calls through to the...

941
01:19:30,367 --> 01:19:33,487
我一直跟你说这里保安水平太差
I always told you this place
had lousy security standards.

942
01:19:35,748 --> 01:19:38,915
那是因为没人会疯到像你一样来这杀人
Because nobody's been crazy enough to
come in here and pull a stunt like this.

943
01:19:39,085 --> 01:19:42,869
- 你有种，路克
- 是啊，真是惊讶我还能走路
- You got some balls, Luke.
- Yeah, amazing I can even walk.

944
01:19:43,047 --> 01:19:44,624
给我碟片
The disc.

945
01:19:44,757 --> 01:19:47,082
什么？你以为我会傻到让中国帮派
What, you think I'm stupid enough
to let a gang of Chinese

946
01:19:47,259 --> 01:19:49,667
穿过前门进到房间来拿它？
walk up the front steps and collect it
from me in my living room?

947
01:19:49,845 --> 01:19:53,510
- 它在离这很远的保险箱里
- 我不认为你很蠢
- It's in a safe far away from here.
- I don't think you're stupid.

948
01:19:53,682 --> 01:19:56,767
所以我不认为你只有一份拷贝
Which is why I don't for a second
believe you gave away the only copy.

949
01:19:56,936 --> 01:19:59,142
我会去见亚历克斯
I'm going to meet Alex.

950
01:19:59,313 --> 01:20:02,764
你先给我碟片，不然我就在非要害的部位给你一枪
First you give me the disc or I'll put
bullets in places that won't kill you

951
01:20:02,942 --> 01:20:06,275
让你下半辈子生不如死
but make you spend
the rest of your life wishing I had.

952
01:20:14,412 --> 01:20:15,989
满意了?
Satisfied?

953
01:20:16,163 --> 01:20:18,535
我要确认一下这不是“金刚葫芦娃”
<i>I wanna make sure
it's not ABBA'sGreatest Hits.</i>

954
01:20:28,509 --> 01:20:30,252
亚历克斯会杀了你的,你知道的
Alex will kill you, you know.

955
01:20:31,554 --> 01:20:33,879
嗯，或许吧
Yeah, probably.

956
01:21:18,768 --> 01:21:22,053
上帝，路克，你气色很不好
Jesus. Luke, you look like hell.

957
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:27,642
酒精而已，缺少睡眠和阳光
Just alcohol, lack of sunlight,
sleep deprivation.

958
01:21:29,236 --> 01:21:31,229
除此以外，我感觉不错
Other than that, I feel great.

959
01:21:33,324 --> 01:21:37,618
呵，我在想，我们在这里抛过多少尸了？
You know, I was thinking, how many
bodies have we dumped in this place?

960
01:21:39,830 --> 01:21:41,206
你知道的，我从不记数
You know, I didn't keep count.

961
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,741
他们都是混蛋，不是么？
They were all assholes, though, right?

962
01:21:49,548 --> 01:21:50,580
放开她，亚历克斯
Let her go, Alex.

963
01:21:52,176 --> 01:21:55,343
丹尼打电话说你去拜访过他
Danny called.
He told me about your visit.

964
01:21:56,847 --> 01:21:59,967
我不得不承认，我都没想到这一手
I have to admit,
even I didn't see that one coming.

965
01:22:00,810 --> 01:22:03,846
你现在有了钱和碟片
You had the disc and the money.

966
01:22:04,021 --> 01:22:06,429
什么...
What...

967
01:22:06,607 --> 01:22:09,359
她对你来说意味着什么？
What is she to you?

968
01:22:11,987 --> 01:22:12,983
生命
Life.

969
01:22:14,907 --> 01:22:18,323
好吧，趁还有命就好好享受吧
Well, enjoy it while it lasts,

970
01:22:18,494 --> 01:22:21,163
不久她就会让你的小命玩完的
'cause she's the reason
yours is gonna be a whole lot shorter.

971
01:22:22,248 --> 01:22:24,240
钱在哪，路克
The money, Luke.

972
01:22:25,459 --> 01:22:27,452
在车里
In the car.

973
01:22:30,381 --> 01:22:31,875
或者银行里
Or in the bank.

974
01:22:34,927 --> 01:22:37,500
或者在中央车站储物柜里
Or in a series of lockers
at Grand Central.

975
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:41,808
或者我可能出于好心悉数捐出了
Or maybe I donated it to charity,
out of the goodness of my heart.

976
01:22:43,894 --> 01:22:46,979
想要知道下落，你就得来硬的
You wanna find out where that money is,
you're gonna have to do it the hard way.

977
01:23:43,913 --> 01:23:46,320
你还好吧，梅？
You all right, Mei?

978
01:23:46,499 --> 01:23:49,950
我见过他打斗，你打不过他的
I saw him fight before.
Bad business for you.

979
01:23:50,711 --> 01:23:52,918
是啊，最糟的是
Yeah. The worst.

980
01:23:55,132 --> 01:23:57,919
你又救了我
You saved me, again.

981
01:23:59,345 --> 01:24:00,922
我们救了对方
We save each other.

982
01:24:05,768 --> 01:24:07,476
我知道你在想什么
I know how you feel.

983
01:24:08,646 --> 01:24:10,888
帮我把这垃圾弄出来
Help me get this sack of garbage
out of the car.

984
01:24:13,275 --> 01:24:15,601
确保他安全回到他老爸那儿
Make sure he gets to his daddy
safe and sound.

985
01:24:19,031 --> 01:24:22,281
5万，赔偿你的损失
50 grand, for your trouble.

986
01:24:22,451 --> 01:24:25,322
钱可能不多，但至少你有命花
Might not seem like much, but at least
you're gonna live to enjoy it.

987
01:24:25,496 --> 01:24:29,244
在经历了这么多后，你还想放过他？
You want him safe and sound
after what he did to you?

988
01:24:31,627 --> 01:24:33,454
为了她
For her sake.

989
01:24:37,258 --> 01:24:39,250
若再见面，你就万事皆休
We meet again, all bets are off.

990
01:25:27,433 --> 01:25:29,722
- 你妈的给我看路，哥们！
- 走你的
- Watch where you're fucking going, man!
- Keep walking.

991
01:25:29,894 --> 01:25:32,135
- 什么？再说一遍？啥？
- 走开
- Excuse me? Pardon me? Anything?
- Walk.

992
01:25:32,313 --> 01:25:34,305
这是他妈的纽约！
This is fucking New York City!

993
01:25:45,868 --> 01:25:48,703
- 第五家银行了，还有几家？
- 没了
- Bank number five. How many more?
- That's it.

994
01:25:49,914 --> 01:25:52,831
现在碟片拷贝已遍布城市保险柜
Got copies of the disc
in security boxes all over the city.

995
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,245
如果我们出事
Anything happens to us,

996
01:25:54,418 --> 01:25:56,577
很多大人物就得倒霉
a lot of important people
are gonna be very sorry.

997
01:25:56,754 --> 01:25:59,624
我们的护身符，这是笔好生意
Our security. Good business for us.

998
01:26:02,009 --> 01:26:04,927
- 现在干嘛？
- 我们离开这里
- What now?
- Now we get out of town.

999
01:26:07,139 --> 01:26:12,430
梅，你是个孩子…我不确定自己能否做个好父亲
Mei, you're a kid and...
I'm not sure I could be a good father.

1000
01:26:12,603 --> 01:26:14,346
我想我能力不足
I think that ship has sailed.

1001
01:26:14,522 --> 01:26:16,431
我不想要父亲
I don't want no more fathers.

1002
01:26:18,901 --> 01:26:21,107
你可以做我朋友吗？
Will you be my friend?

1003
01:26:22,488 --> 01:26:24,481
至死都愿
Till my dying day.

1004
01:26:29,036 --> 01:26:32,452
我找到一家在西雅图专门培训天才儿童的学校
I got info on a school
for gifted kids up in Seattle.

1005
01:26:34,083 --> 01:26:37,666
这会是次美妙旅行，如果你喜欢那里的风光的话
It's a nice drive,
if you like trees and shit.

1006
01:26:39,964 --> 01:26:40,960
我们安全了吗？
Are we safe?

1007
01:26:43,259 --> 01:26:46,758
别想太多，梅，别想太多
One day at a time, Mei.
One day at a time.
