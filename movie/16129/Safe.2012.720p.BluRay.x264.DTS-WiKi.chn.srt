片名：《暂告安全》

4
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:02,208
布鲁克林，纽约，一小时前

5
00:00:59,721 --> 00:01:02,891
把她带过来！轻点，她只是个孩子！

6
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:04,655
好吧，我大可以杀了她

7
00:01:51,024 --> 00:01:54,268
南京，中国，一年前

8
00:01:49,445 --> 00:01:54,268
204,35倍，是另外一种算法，加起来是350

9
00:01:55,622 --> 00:01:59,066
如果用另外一种算法，加起来是365

10
00:01:59,114 --> 00:02:01,151
只有一个算法是对的

11
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,445
（两人都做错了，定义域是X|X≠-2，
嘴上说的和黑板上的也牛头不对马嘴）

12
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,156
苏先生，我没有不尊重你的意思

13
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:08,969
但是你的算法是错的

14
00:02:15,124 --> 00:02:16,218
梅

15
00:02:16,297 --> 00:02:18,564
我们要把你转去另一个学校

16
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,858
可是我的朋友都在这儿，而且我的妈妈...

17
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:24,508
梅，你太聪明了，你是个天才

18
00:02:24,581 --> 00:02:26,385
你该上一个特殊的学校

19
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:29,200
你可以找新朋友的

20
00:02:29,265 --> 00:02:33,684
别难过，梅，我们永远都是你的朋友，听说北京的小孩人都很好的

21
00:02:33,749 --> 00:02:35,978
你在那儿会过得很开心的

22
00:02:36,047 --> 00:02:38,167
我根本就不喜欢数学

23
00:02:38,215 --> 00:02:42,442
我喜欢我现在的朋友，我不想要交新的朋友，我不喜欢数学

24
00:02:42,527 --> 00:02:44,528
你来做数学，我们给你写信，

25
00:02:44,603 --> 00:02:47,343
我们每个星期都给你往北京写封信

26
00:02:47,428 --> 00:02:48,438
你发誓？

27
00:02:48,516 --> 00:02:51,722
当然，你想让我们失去一个有名的朋友吗？

28
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,729
不，梅，我们永远都是你的...

29
00:02:58,918 --> 00:03:01,662
新泽西联航中心球馆

30
00:04:59,856 --> 00:05:04,824
这是我的侄女，白玉

31
00:05:04,914 --> 00:05:06,753
认识吧？

32
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,891
她在我朋友的班里

33
00:05:08,913 --> 00:05:12,589
她说啊，你的脑筋啊很像电脑

34
00:05:13,512 --> 00:05:17,737
我跟你的老师讲过了，他也这样说

35
00:05:18,828 --> 00:05:20,888
你知道了吧

36
00:05:22,702 --> 00:05:24,844
很可爱啊

37
00:05:25,152 --> 00:05:33,359
电脑很讨厌，太容易留下痕迹，他们还说...

38
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:35,247
走开呀，走开！

39
00:05:38,574 --> 00:05:43,457
你学的东西你不会忘的，是不是？

40
00:05:50,276 --> 00:05:56,577
那我到你的家，把你的妈妈杀掉好不好啊！

41
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,924
很好，很好

42
00:06:11,314 --> 00:06:13,487
看来他们说的对了

43
00:06:13,803 --> 00:06:18,909
苏先生告诉我你小的时候你爸爸已经走掉了

44
00:06:18,983 --> 00:06:22,715
你的妈妈现在很病了

45
00:06:23,995 --> 00:06:28,045
很快你变成一个人，你喜欢孤独吗？

46
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:36,237
放心，我们会好好照顾你的妈妈

47
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:39,763
张，你的新爸爸

48
00:06:39,838 --> 00:06:44,360
他呢会带你漂洋过海，不过那边那里的人呢很喜欢

49
00:06:44,557 --> 00:06:46,906
找我们的麻烦，所以我要你

50
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,456
帮我们算一算

51
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:38,864
卫路的店，这个礼拜是两万六千，上个礼拜是二十六

52
00:11:39,344 --> 00:11:42,537
侯进每个礼拜是正好一万五千

53
00:11:42,955 --> 00:11:44,887
他在博易街的店

54
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:48,978
五月份在丢钱，但是七月八月份他就赚回来了

55
00:11:45,609 --> 00:11:48,753
中国城，纽约，一年后

56
00:11:50,012 --> 00:11:54,348
邵成，上个礼拜是42，这个礼拜是42.5

57
00:11:54,391 --> 00:11:57,529
每个月盈利增长7%

58
00:11:57,594 --> 00:12:02,125
莫特区整个盈利总共上升了72535

59
00:12:03,158 --> 00:12:05,933
我们从梁先生那里拿了5%

60
00:12:06,004 --> 00:12:09,655
他们都每个礼拜盈利6千到8千

61
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:16,073
上个礼拜是八十万，这个礼拜也是八十万

62
00:12:59,144 --> 00:12:59,705
停！

63
00:13:01,551 --> 00:13:04,021
不要打了，拜托，不要打了

64
00:13:16,239 --> 00:13:21,519
今晚，你们会有一个新的场上工头

65
00:13:21,603 --> 00:13:25,794
如果钱又少了，那就不知道谁会走！

66
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,339
今天晚上他请

67
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:33,627
肯定不是我请

68
00:13:34,202 --> 00:13:35,728
肯定你啊，这么多钱

69
00:13:36,423 --> 00:13:37,504
他赢了这么多钱

70
00:13:54,606 --> 00:14:00,385
看来你还是不懂这个生意，不说了

71
00:14:01,681 --> 00:14:03,749
吃你的饭吧

72
00:18:16,814 --> 00:18:22,862
梅，到你房间去记住这些数字

73
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:24,400
我已经记住了

74
00:18:26,077 --> 00:18:29,535
这些数字很重要

75
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:33,498
为了你妈，你要认真一点，知道吗？

76
00:18:33,615 --> 00:18:36,313
你真的记住了？

77
00:18:36,502 --> 00:18:40,394
我可以给你重复一遍，但是又长又无聊

78
00:18:45,323 --> 00:18:49,247
你看，还没到一年呢，她已经自信的很了

79
00:18:51,254 --> 00:18:56,124
如果，她说她可以背出密码，她就能背出

80
00:18:56,238 --> 00:18:58,179
我保证

81
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:00,087
好了好了

82
00:19:00,994 --> 00:19:04,466
我们要交给你一个很重要的工作

83
00:20:48,403 --> 00:20:52,074
梅，这是你的指令

84
00:20:52,262 --> 00:20:57,913
张会带你见一个人，那个人会给你一个新的数字

85
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,311
记住那个数字

86
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:06,553
然后呢张会带你去一个地方，你会得到最后的指令

87
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,729
你学的很快

88
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:27,172
如果干的好，你会跟着韩叔前途无量

89
00:25:09,206 --> 00:25:16,505
梅，我跟他们讲他们想知道的事情
他们给了我一把一把的钱

90
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:21,897
没事，你要是这么做他们也会帮助你的

91
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,303
你真是个笨女人

92
00:25:25,739 --> 00:25:26,619
你不知道生意

93
00:25:26,823 --> 00:25:29,242
你给了他们想要的东西，现在他们要杀了你

94
00:36:59,036 --> 00:37:02,628
什姆亚金和其他人消失了是什么意思？

95
00:37:02,677 --> 00:37:04,434
有人把她带走了

96
00:37:05,003 --> 00:37:07,737
不是警察，他还差点干掉几个警察

97
00:37:08,739 --> 00:37:11,282
也不是中国人，我不知道他到底是谁

98
00:37:11,417 --> 00:37:17,957
干掉他，活捉女孩，不行就全干掉

99
00:44:47,489 --> 00:44:49,344
我能查到的就是这些了

100
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:56,447
怎么样?

101
00:44:56,884 --> 00:44:59,980
我们现在在找一个男的，他和一个女孩在一起

102
00:45:00,132 --> 00:45:04,151
他有武器，非常危险，警察局的人说他是…

103
00:56:27,437 --> 00:56:29,916
谁杀了那个俄国人?

104
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:32,756
我不知道,他没有告诉我

105
00:56:33,959 --> 00:56:35,884
他有没有问到那个数字？

106
00:56:36,885 --> 00:56:38,595
每个人都问那个数字

107
00:56:43,287 --> 00:56:46,624
那你跟他们讲些什么呢？

108
00:56:50,728 --> 00:56:52,151
我什么都没说

109
00:56:53,315 --> 00:56:54,392
什么？

110
00:56:56,495 --> 00:56:58,198
我什么都没说

111
00:57:00,365 --> 00:57:01,952
你在撒谎！！！

112
00:57:02,062 --> 00:57:03,620
韩叔叔我当然不会给你撒谎的

113
00:57:03,789 --> 00:57:08,521
打个电话告诉他们把阿梅的妈妈干掉

114
00:57:08,709 --> 00:57:12,587
因为她的女儿是骗子

115
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:16,289
韩叔叔，我发誓，我假装不会说英文也听不懂

116
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:21,033
他们又吼又叫的但是我什么都没说，因为我知道你会生气的

117
00:57:21,205 --> 00:57:22,702
我向我妈发誓

118
00:59:23,314 --> 00:59:26,770
我从来不知这种时候该说什么

119
00:59:29,356 --> 00:59:31,372
什么时候？

120
00:59:31,538 --> 00:59:33,979
在我杀人之前

121
01:11:56,909 --> 01:11:58,473
我们被袭击了

122
01:11:58,581 --> 01:12:00,663
他们不是俄国人，好像是警察

123
01:12:00,809 --> 01:12:02,644
不过他们比警察更厉害

124
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:06,502
派点人来，他们杀了很多人，快点啊，我们需要...

125
01:12:07,667 --> 01:12:14,010
告诉张，尽快拿到那个数字然后把跑腿的干掉

126
01:12:14,237 --> 01:12:19,328
这个数字由我们自己来破解

127
01:12:19,447 --> 01:12:20,057
你们听懂了吗？

128
01:25:03,919 --> 01:25:05,406
最尊敬的叔叔

129
01:25:05,538 --> 01:25:09,160
这里有两千九百九十五万美元

130
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:13,756
我们会还余下的5万，再加10%的利息

131
01:25:14,373 --> 01:25:16,355
如果万一您还生气

132
01:25:16,525 --> 01:25:21,777
我必须告诉您，我知道您在中国城生意的每一个帐号

133
01:25:21,861 --> 01:25:24,644
还有汇钱到中国的途径

134
01:25:24,745 --> 01:25:29,187
您不找我们的麻烦，我们也不会找您的麻烦

135
01:25:29,521 --> 01:25:32,308
来追我们的话，你的世界就完了

136
01:25:32,511 --> 01:25:34,706
我保证说话算话

137
01:25:37,402 --> 01:25:39,402
给我准备飞机票

138
01:25:40,649 --> 01:25:42,845
我再也不想看到这个

139
01:25:44,028 --> 01:25:45,238
鬼地方！

140
01:27:11,288 --> 01:27:16,500

141
00:29:03,654 --> 00:29:05,745
警察跟我们干上了

142
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:07,529
是吗？

143
00:29:07,716 --> 00:29:08,742
你没有办法？

144
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:14,629
你这个不动脑筋的笨蛋,如果你让警察

145
00:29:14,822 --> 00:29:20,590
或俄国人先找到那个女孩,我就砍了你人头

146
00:29:29,229 --> 00:29:30,929
我们开打吧

147
00:41:03,353 --> 00:41:06,729
她一定在这里，不过我看不清楚

148
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:09,127
干扰太多

149
00:41:09,362 --> 00:41:10,648
等一下

150
00:41:11,529 --> 00:41:12,073
等一下！

151
00:41:13,669 --> 00:41:15,229
我找到她了

152
00:52:26,887 --> 00:52:27,729
谁？

153
00:52:27,962 --> 00:52:32,629
你以为是谁？我是皮特,你电话里没我号码吗？

154
00:52:32,788 --> 00:52:36,329
皮特？警察说在地铁里发现你跟...

155
00:52:36,626 --> 00:52:39,729
警方报告有误

156
00:52:39,884 --> 00:52:41,560
其他人被...

157
00:52:42,212 --> 00:52:44,029
什么声音？

158
00:52:44,888 --> 00:52:47,229
抱歉，信号不好

159
00:52:47,301 --> 00:52:49,229
我拿到数字了

160
00:52:49,417 --> 00:52:50,729
什么？

161
00:52:50,796 --> 00:52:54,729
在她被劫走前，我们从她那拿到数字了

162
00:52:54,816 --> 00:52:58,729
我跟条子玩了几个小时的捉迷藏

163
00:52:58,831 --> 00:53:01,976
伊哥，把数字记到手机里

164
00:53:02,556 --> 00:53:04,233
说吧，告诉我数字

165
00:53:04,233 --> 00:53:09,229
你疯了吗？数字在一公里外一张纸上，你在哪？

166
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:10,529
他可能带警察来了

167
00:53:10,648 --> 00:53:14,229
我们要清场吗？

168
00:53:14,416 --> 00:53:17,229
如果有警察，我们最好避开人群

169
00:53:17,324 --> 00:53:19,309
而且需要有利地形

170
00:53:21,917 --> 00:53:23,193
好的，皮特...

171
00:53:23,969 --> 00:53:26,729
现在给你个机会做英雄

172
00:53:26,812 --> 00:53:27,929
曼梦西卡见

173
00:53:28,002 --> 00:53:29,429
快来

174
00:53:29,811 --> 00:53:31,479
我马上到

175
00:01:10,124 --> 00:01:11,155
你在骗我
You're lying to me.

176
00:01:11,334 --> 00:01:13,706
没有！我不知道你在说什么
I'm not.
I don't know what you're talking about.

177
00:01:13,878 --> 00:01:16,665
我不知道你想要什么，我发誓
I don't know what you want from me.
I swear I don't.

178
00:01:16,839 --> 00:01:18,499
我有三个孩子
I have three children.

179
00:01:18,674 --> 00:01:21,675
作为父亲，首先要学会的
The first thing you have to learn
as a father is to know

180
00:01:21,844 --> 00:01:24,300
就是知道你的孩子何时在欺骗你
when your children are lying to you.

181
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,427
你在欺骗我，如果你不说真话
You're lying to me,
and if you don't stop,

182
00:01:29,602 --> 00:01:33,350
我就要用你们那些有名的手段
I'm going to use one of those tortures
your people are so famous for

183
00:01:33,522 --> 00:01:37,141
来折磨你弱小的身体，直到你告诉我一切
on your little body
until you tell me what I want to know.

184
00:01:44,283 --> 00:01:48,696
最后一次，告诉我那些数字
For the last time,
give me the numbers.

185
00:02:54,545 --> 00:02:55,477
梅！
Mei!

186
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:11,993
你怎么还敢来这？
How dare you come here!
You have no right!

187
00:03:12,163 --> 00:03:14,867
- 妈妈！别打了！住手！
- 你没资格待在这里！没资格！
- Ma, enough! Stop!
- You've no right to be here. No right!

188
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:18,908
你应该被关在监狱里！监狱里！
You should be in jail!
You should be in jail!

189
00:03:21,088 --> 00:03:23,295
滚出去！你给我滚出去！
You get out of here!
You get out of here.

190
00:03:23,466 --> 00:03:26,039
- 对不起
- 我要杀掉你！我会杀掉你的！
- I'm sorry.
- I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

191
00:03:39,398 --> 00:03:42,020
你个废物！那孩子不应该出现在擂台上！
Piece of garbage. The kid
should never been in there with me.

192
00:03:43,027 --> 00:03:44,687
路克，别这样！你疯了吗？
Luke, come on. What, are you crazy, man?

193
00:03:44,862 --> 00:03:47,697
- 走开！
- 给我走开！
- Get off.
- Get off, now!

194
00:03:48,532 --> 00:03:49,777
我从来都不喜欢你，路克
I never liked you, Luke.

195
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,951
你比擂台上90%的人都厉害
You're a betterfighter than 90%
of the guys you go in the cage with,

196
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,790
但你却任人蹂躏
but you just let 'em pound on you
like you're a side of beef.

197
00:03:55,956 --> 00:03:58,364
你几乎输给过擂台上的每一个笨蛋
You already lost to every chump
in the circuit.

198
00:03:58,542 --> 00:04:00,535
但是昨晚
But last night, of all nights,

199
00:04:00,711 --> 00:04:03,036
你应该在第二轮输掉的，你个混蛋
you're supposed to go down
in the second, you son of a bitch.

200
00:04:03,214 --> 00:04:04,412
- 仅仅一拳！
- 退后！
- Once.
- Back off.

201
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,164
我就打了他一拳！你从哪里找到他的，操场？
I hit him once. Where'd you find him,
the fucking playground?

202
00:04:07,343 --> 00:04:09,300
Youtube，你个混蛋
YouTube, you asshole.

203
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:12,305
在你把他打晕前，那个孩子还是个网络红人
The kid's an internet sensation
until you put him in a coma,

204
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:15,349
坦白说，我并不关心这个
which frankly
I do not give a shit about.

205
00:04:15,518 --> 00:04:17,557
但是你让我输掉了100万美元
But you cost me a million dollars,

206
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:21,062
当然这和你让德切斯基输掉的比起来就不算什么了
which is nothing
compared what you cost Docheski.

207
00:04:21,232 --> 00:04:23,557
很好！这个名字耳熟吧？
Yeah. You recognise the name?

208
00:04:23,734 --> 00:04:26,106
他在你身上下了大赌注
He was betting on you big time
to take the dive.

209
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,945
他会把这一切都怪罪到我头上来的
And he's gonna take it out on me too

210
00:04:28,114 --> 00:04:31,364
因为他知道这件事情是我这白痴搞出来的
'cause he knows I'm the schmuck
that set this whole thing up.

211
00:04:32,326 --> 00:04:37,072
除非我把你的脑袋送给他
Unless I deliver your head
with a down payment.

212
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:39,457
你知道俄国人是什么样子的
You know how the Russians are.

213
00:04:55,766 --> 00:04:57,806
梅
Mei.

214
00:04:57,977 --> 00:04:59,720
梅
Mei.

215
00:06:51,632 --> 00:06:54,752
你打对号码了，有什么事就留言吧
<i>You got the right number,
so leave the right message.</i>

216
00:06:54,927 --> 00:06:57,548
听到后立刻给我回电，安妮，立刻
Call me when you get this, Annie.
I mean right away.

217
00:06:57,722 --> 00:06:59,299
如果你出去了，别回家
If you're out, don't go home.

218
00:06:59,473 --> 00:07:01,513
我不是在吓唬你，记得赶紧回电话
If I'm scaring you, that's good.
Call me.

219
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:07,472
安妮？
Annie?

220
00:07:33,716 --> 00:07:35,709
就这样？
That's it?

221
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,761
我听说你是个硬汉啊
I heard you were
some kind of a tough guy.

222
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,421
不挣扎下？
No fighting?

223
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,517
就直接跪在地上像只求死的狗一样？
You're just going to sit on the floor
like a dog who wants to die?

224
00:07:45,645 --> 00:07:47,637
不好意思搞得那么乱
Sorry it had to be so messy.

225
00:07:49,357 --> 00:07:51,349
这些家伙还在学习中
The boy is still learning.

226
00:07:52,193 --> 00:07:55,147
我虽然不是医生，但我想她有孩子了
And I'm not a doctor,
but I think she was eating for two.

227
00:07:55,321 --> 00:07:57,527
我们就像查尔斯・曼森家一样
We're like Charlie Manson family, no?

228
00:07:57,657 --> 00:08:01,701
我父亲本想派其他人来的，但我想锻炼下
My father was going to send
someone else, but I'm making my bones.

229
00:08:03,788 --> 00:08:06,907
你就靠杀害那些没有还手能力的人来锻炼
You make your bones by killing someone
who can hurt you back.

230
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:10,084
那会是谁呢？你？
And who would that be? You?

231
00:08:10,252 --> 00:08:12,411
好吧，当然是你
Well, why not?

232
00:08:12,588 --> 00:08:14,664
你刚杀了你老婆
You just killed your wife.

233
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,248
我没杀她，是你杀的！
I didn't kill her. You did.

234
00:08:18,552 --> 00:08:21,719
但是，你想伤害我？很好
Look, you want to hurt me? Good.

235
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:23,882
我倒想看看你能做些什么
I want to see you try.

236
00:08:25,017 --> 00:08:26,761
杀了我吧
Get it over with.

237
00:08:26,936 --> 00:08:31,562
杀了你？你让我父亲输钱，让我的家族难堪
Over? You cost my father money,
made my family look bad.

238
00:08:31,691 --> 00:08:34,894
现在我们想把你作为一个特例对待
Now we're going to make
an extra special example out of you.

239
00:08:35,069 --> 00:08:38,355
我们查过你的档案，没有什么有趣的东西
So, we looked into your records.
Not much to find.

240
00:08:38,572 --> 00:08:41,110
为城市的卫生系统工作
Work for city,
garbage collection, sanitation.

241
00:08:41,283 --> 00:08:44,237
收益不错，但是缺乏魅力，不是么？
Good benefits but no glamour, eh?

242
00:08:44,412 --> 00:08:48,279
父母双亡，没有兄弟姐妹
Father and mother dead,
no brothers or sisters,

243
00:08:48,457 --> 00:08:50,331
这真是糟糕
which is too bad,

244
00:08:50,501 --> 00:08:52,992
我本想把他们都干掉的
because I would like
to take them from you too.

245
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,587
但是你爱你的老婆，我们知道这点
But you love your wife.
We know that.

246
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,921
那么，这样子说定了：
So here's the deal.

247
00:09:01,095 --> 00:09:04,262
你可以走了，不过我们会盯着你的
You're free to go,
but we will have eyes on you.

248
00:09:04,432 --> 00:09:07,848
不是一直，但是我们会在你最不希望出现的时候出现
Not always, but when
you least expect it, we'll be there.

249
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:10,510
任何一个你想结交的人，甚至是交谈过的
Anyone you try to make friends with
or even talk to,

250
00:09:10,688 --> 00:09:13,143
反正是有过任何交集的人
other than ordering a hot dog
or something,

251
00:09:13,316 --> 00:09:17,479
都会像你老婆一样因你而死
will die, like your wife,
because of you.

252
00:09:17,653 --> 00:09:19,812
当然你可以随时结束这一切！跳桥
Of course, you can always end it,
jump off a bridge,

253
00:09:19,989 --> 00:09:21,697
卧轨
throw yourself in front of a train,

254
00:09:21,866 --> 00:09:25,401
将你的不朽的灵魂送去地狱，如果你相信这些狗屁
damn your eternal soul to hell,
if you believe in that kind of bullshit.

255
00:09:25,619 --> 00:09:27,279
就我个人来说，我不相信
Personally, I don't.

256
00:09:27,455 --> 00:09:29,661
所以，如果我是你，我宁愿去自杀
So I'd go for it if I were you.

257
00:09:33,044 --> 00:09:35,416
但是我不是你
But I am not you.

258
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:37,918
感谢上帝
Thank God.

259
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,498
所以做你想做的事吧
So do what you want.

260
00:09:40,676 --> 00:09:43,167
如果你明天还在这，我们会杀掉房东
If you're still here tomorrow,
we're going to kill the landlady.

261
00:09:43,346 --> 00:09:45,883
- 她叫什么名字？
- 特巴洛斯基
- What was her name?
- Tobolovsky.

262
00:09:46,057 --> 00:09:48,215
特巴洛斯基夫人
Mrs Tobolovsky.

263
00:09:48,392 --> 00:09:50,385
很好
Nice lady.

264
00:09:51,395 --> 00:09:53,471
收拾一下吧，清洁工
Clean up the mess, garbage man.

265
00:09:59,111 --> 00:10:02,196
好了！她是你女儿，她也是美国公民
All right, she's your daughter
and she's an American citizen.

266
00:10:03,032 --> 00:10:06,152
我不会打听你们的关系，这是你们的事
I ain't gonna ask what the deal is
with her. That's your business.

267
00:10:07,036 --> 00:10:10,037
不过我想说的是，找关系是很困难的
But I'm gonna tell you,
pulling strings is hard work,

268
00:10:10,206 --> 00:10:12,163
困难的工作一般不会免费
and hard work don't come free.

269
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,204
开个价吧，沃夫队长
Your price, Captain Wolf?

270
00:10:17,672 --> 00:10:19,748
中国城辖区多交20%
Chinatown precinct take goes up 20%.

271
00:10:19,924 --> 00:10:24,550
布朗克斯，布鲁克林每个月各涨10%
Bronx 121st, Brooklyn divisions,
each go up by 10%, monthly.

272
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,006
这个价格对于一个小女孩的护照和文书工作来说太过分了
That's a steep price for a passport
and some papers for a little girl.

273
00:10:29,433 --> 00:10:31,093
现在的日子都不好过啊
Things are tough all over.

274
00:10:36,357 --> 00:10:37,816
中国城加10%
Chinatown gets upped 10%.

275
00:10:37,984 --> 00:10:40,356
布朗克斯和布鲁克林不变
Bronx and Brooklyn will settle
for the current rate

276
00:10:40,528 --> 00:10:42,152
然后我们在感受到压力的时候
and the fact
that we won't start shooting

277
00:10:42,321 --> 00:10:46,698
不会随意射杀街上的警察和警察家属
cops and their families in the streets
like dogs at the first sign of pressure.

278
00:10:48,285 --> 00:10:50,611
现在的日子都不好过啊
Things are tough all over.

279
00:11:09,598 --> 00:11:12,054
嘿，朋友，我见过你，我看过你在新泽西的拳击
Hey, man, I know you.
I saw yourfight in Jersey.

280
00:11:12,226 --> 00:11:14,978
实在是太棒了，你轻松干掉了那家伙
It was really good.
You knocked that guy out.

281
00:11:15,146 --> 00:11:18,728
- 不是的
- 我有好东西，兄弟
- No.
- That was some good shit, man.

282
00:11:18,858 --> 00:11:20,850
很棒的格斗
Great fight.

283
00:12:10,576 --> 00:12:12,652
赌场呢？
The casino?

284
00:12:18,668 --> 00:12:20,909
80万整？
Exactly 800,000?

285
00:12:21,087 --> 00:12:23,079
大约80万
It's almost 800.

286
00:12:27,134 --> 00:12:29,091
我不是问你是不是大概80万
I'm not asking you if it's almost 800.

287
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:31,254
我要准确数字
I want the exact number.

288
00:12:32,098 --> 00:12:35,467
78万5370美元
$785,370.

289
00:12:38,896 --> 00:12:42,182
- 再上一周呢？
- 在亏钱
- And the week before?
- It's losing money.

290
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,459
- 怎么？
- 为什么？
- What?
- Why?

291
00:13:44,128 --> 00:13:47,045
因为他损害了生意，生意是件很严肃的事情
Because he was hurting business,
and business is a serious matter.

292
00:13:47,214 --> 00:13:48,792
我懂生意
I understand business.

293
00:13:48,966 --> 00:13:52,050
但是既然要杀他，为什么还要打他？
But why beat him
if you were going to kill him anyway?

294
00:14:10,655 --> 00:14:12,647
靠，靠！
Fuck you. Fuck you!

295
00:14:17,745 --> 00:14:20,318
- 你不能进来
- 我只想要些吃的！
- You can't come in the shelter.
- Just trying to get something to eat!

296
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:27,034
赶紧睡觉！5分钟后熄灯
Wrap it up. Lights out in five.

297
00:14:28,464 --> 00:14:30,457
赶紧睡觉
Wrap it up.

298
00:14:31,425 --> 00:14:32,421
快点
Come on, guys.

299
00:14:42,937 --> 00:14:44,929
好鞋子
Nice kicks.

300
00:14:47,942 --> 00:14:52,271
最好早上它们还在，不然你就得用耳朵穿上它们了
They'd better be here in the morning
or you'll be wearing them on your ears,

301
00:14:52,446 --> 00:14:55,613
因为我会把你的脚给扭下来
'cause I'll chew yourfeet off
at the goddamn ankles.

302
00:15:08,462 --> 00:15:12,958
我真的想要双新点的鞋子，我会为你做任何事情
I could really use some new shoes, man.
I'll do whatever you want, you know?

303
00:15:14,593 --> 00:15:16,586
任何能帮你熬过晚上的事情
Whatever gets you through the night.

304
00:15:17,596 --> 00:15:20,384
- 我不能...
- 闭嘴，闭嘴！
- I just... I can't take another...
- Shut up. Shut up.

305
00:15:22,727 --> 00:15:25,052
闭嘴，拿走吧，我还有旧鞋子
Shut up and take them.
I've still got my old ones.

306
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,148
好好照顾你的脚
Go and get those feet looked at.

307
00:15:31,068 --> 00:15:32,646
都烂掉了
Gangrene's setting in.

308
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,691
我会的，谢谢你，朋友
I will. Thank you, man.

309
00:15:37,325 --> 00:15:40,409
上帝保佑你，兄弟，上帝保佑你
Jesus loves you, brother.
Jesus loves you.

310
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,580
熄灯了，明早七点会叫醒你们的
<i>Lights out. Wake-up call's 7am.</i>

311
00:15:50,755 --> 00:15:52,747
熄灯
<i>Lights out.</i>

312
00:15:53,591 --> 00:15:55,583
熄灯
<i>Lights out.</i>

313
00:16:12,777 --> 00:16:14,354
嘘
Shh.

314
00:16:14,528 --> 00:16:17,198
梅，我有个坏消息
Mei, I have sad news.

315
00:16:18,616 --> 00:16:22,945
我听到他们在谈论…你妈妈走了
I heard them talking and...
your mother is gone.

316
00:16:25,581 --> 00:16:27,621
她两周前在医院去世了
She died two weeks ago in the hospital.

317
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:30,209
他们不会告诉你的
They werert going to tell you,

318
00:16:30,378 --> 00:16:33,378
但是我告诉你，这样子你可以为她的灵魂祈祷
but I'm telling you
so that you can pray

319
00:16:33,547 --> 00:16:35,670
让她找到去天堂的路
for her soul to find its way to heaven.

320
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:39,130
别告诉他们，如果他们发现我告诉你…
Please don't say anything.
If they find out I told you...

321
00:16:39,303 --> 00:16:42,340
我会保密的，谢谢
I won't say anything. Thank you

322
00:16:45,768 --> 00:16:50,097
所有人起床！9点前离开这里
<i>Everybody up.
Shelter needs to be cleared by 9am.</i>

323
00:16:50,272 --> 00:16:54,140
在3：30前办好今晚的床铺预定
<i>Bed reservations for tonight
need to be made by 3:30.</i>

324
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:56,940
带走所有个人物品
<i>Please remove
all your personal belongings.</i>

325
00:16:57,905 --> 00:17:00,277
所有人起床！走了！
Everybody up. Come on, let's go.

326
00:17:00,449 --> 00:17:02,821
带好个人物品，你们知道规矩的
Take your belongings with you.
You know the drill.

327
00:17:29,687 --> 00:17:32,260
那么，告诉我们发生了什么
So you wanna tell us what happened?

328
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,397
有人喜欢那鞋子
Someone liked his shoes.

329
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:37,105
搞笑的家伙！你认为这是个玩笑？
Funny guy. You think this is a joke?

330
00:17:37,278 --> 00:17:39,899
你们知道的，你们这帮保安有多糟糕
You know, you guys
are a hell of a crack security squad.

331
00:17:40,114 --> 00:17:42,522
你做的很对，你本来可以说些什么的
You were right here.
You could have said something.

332
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,820
但是你喝醉酒忙着睡觉，是不是？
But you were too busy
sleeping off this contraband, right?

333
00:17:46,245 --> 00:17:48,238
你如果再来这个避难所
Come into this shelter again

334
00:17:48,414 --> 00:17:51,534
我就把你踹到大街上去
and I'm gonna run your raggedy ass
back out into the street.

335
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,368
嘿！走路不看路的？
Hey! Watch where you're going, man.

336
00:19:18,546 --> 00:19:21,381
要不要给你点颜色瞧瞧？
You could get your ass
kicked for that, OK? Huh?

337
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,842
4块5毛5
4.55.

338
00:19:36,314 --> 00:19:38,105
你没钱就得出去
If you got no money,
you gotta get out of line.

339
00:19:38,274 --> 00:19:40,266
我有钱
I got money.

340
00:19:41,152 --> 00:19:43,275
他没有钱，看看他那样子
He doesn't have any money.
Look at him.

341
00:19:43,446 --> 00:19:46,945
先生，我告诉过你，如果你没钱，你得离开，懂吗？
Mister, I told you, if you don't
have money, you have to leave, OK?

342
00:19:47,116 --> 00:19:49,239
让开，还有人在等呢
You gotta get out of line.
People are waiting.

343
00:19:50,328 --> 00:19:52,486
走开，兄弟，让开
<i>Come on, buddy. You gotta go.</i>

344
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:11,797
- 这家伙惹麻烦了吗？
- 他疯了，长官
- This guy giving you trouble?
- He's crazy, Officer.

345
00:20:11,974 --> 00:20:14,548
- 把他带出去，好吗？
- 好的，过来，我们走
- Get him out of here, OK?
- All right, come on, let's go.

346
00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:18,178
嘿，你！过来，我们走！出去！到街上去！
Hey, you, come on. Let's go.
Out. On the street.

347
00:20:18,356 --> 00:20:20,977
哥们，如果你想当小丑，去马戏团
Let's go, funny boy. You wanna be
a clown, go join the circus.

348
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:24,151
别在我辖区闹事，听懂了吗？
我不想在这附近再见到你，嘿！
Not in my precinct, you hear me?
I don't wanna see you around here. Hey.

349
00:20:27,657 --> 00:20:29,115
上帝啊
Jesus Christ.

350
00:20:29,283 --> 00:20:31,774
看看我抓到了谁
Look what the cat dragged in.

351
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,040
不可思议
Unbelievable.

352
00:20:40,211 --> 00:20:43,295
- 看着他
- 看着他？
- Look at him.
- Look at him?

353
00:20:43,422 --> 00:20:45,415
不去闻闻？
How about the smell?

354
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,293
我打电话叫大家过来
Think I'll call the boys.

355
00:21:12,618 --> 00:21:14,611
想我们吗，伙计？
You miss us, partner?

356
00:21:15,621 --> 00:21:17,365
欢迎回来
Welcome back to the force.

357
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:20,871
梅…
Mei...

358
00:21:39,103 --> 00:21:41,096
对不起，我不能让他们抓到你
I'm sorry. I can't let them have you.

359
00:21:42,857 --> 00:21:45,727
梅！回来这里！
Mei! Get back here!

360
00:21:59,665 --> 00:22:04,374
- 日子过的怎么样，路克？
- 悲剧，不过正在变好
- How's your day been, Luke?
- Started lousy. But it's looking up.

361
00:22:07,548 --> 00:22:11,842
路克・莱特，以前纽约最佳警察
Luke Wright, the Big Apple's hardest cop
once upon a time.

362
00:22:12,011 --> 00:22:14,881
什么都敢试，但你知道你真正的才能吗？
You always could take a shot.
But you know what your real talent is?

363
00:22:15,056 --> 00:22:17,725
你是个牵线人！我是说，谁会想到
You're a uniter. I mean, who'd
have thought that us and the Russkies

364
00:22:17,892 --> 00:22:19,968
我们会和俄国佬拴在一起？
would ever be on the same page
about anything?

365
00:22:20,144 --> 00:22:23,264
不是我！很高兴见到你，混蛋！
Not me. Nice to see you, rat.

366
00:22:23,439 --> 00:22:27,603
自从你出卖我们，我就一直想这么做了
Been wanting to do this ever since the
day you opened your big fucking mouth!

367
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:34,729
当我们听说德切斯基如何对付你时，我笑惨了
When we heard what Docheski did to you,
I mean, I had to laugh.

368
00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:36,866
对于安妮我们很抱歉
I mean, we felt bad for Annie ar all.

369
00:22:37,036 --> 00:22:39,325
她知道她和谁在一起
Them's the breaks.
She knew who she was with.

370
00:22:39,497 --> 00:22:41,620
街上有流言说你回来的时候
Word come up from the street
you were back,

371
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:43,333
我们甚至不敢相信
we couldn't believe our fucking ears.

372
00:22:43,501 --> 00:22:47,581
你为什么回来？为什么不远走高飞？
Why would you come back? Why wouldn't
you disappear somewhere far way, huh?

373
00:22:47,755 --> 00:22:49,333
比如说月球
Like the moon.

374
00:22:49,507 --> 00:22:51,962
我想家了
I missed home.

375
00:22:54,845 --> 00:22:59,258
你曾是我们一员，路克，我们曾是一个团队，一个家庭
You were one of us, Luke.
We were a team. We were family.

376
00:22:59,433 --> 00:23:02,637
- 然后你扔下了我们
- 我们曾经有多风光，混蛋
- Then you threw us under the bus.
- We were kings, you son of a bitch!

377
00:23:03,771 --> 00:23:05,598
现在，我们只是一群可怜虫
Now we're bunch of goddamn serfs.

378
00:23:09,151 --> 00:23:11,358
嘿，嘿，冷静，伯努瓦
Hey, hey, easy, Benoit, huh?

379
00:23:15,825 --> 00:23:18,150
当你回来的时候，我们以为你想寻死
When you came back,
we figured you wanted to die.

380
00:23:18,327 --> 00:23:21,743
我们还开了个盘口赌你怎么死，你知道的
We got a pool going on when
you're gonna end it and how, you know,

381
00:23:21,914 --> 00:23:23,658
公交，火车…
bus, train...

382
00:23:25,001 --> 00:23:27,207
我赌“找警察自杀”
I got my money on suicide by cop.

383
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,169
来吧，拿好了
Come on, take it.

384
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,294
来一枪，来吧
Take a shot. Come on.

385
00:23:34,468 --> 00:23:36,591
安妮在等着你
Annie's waiting for you.

386
00:23:36,762 --> 00:23:39,965
问题是，你真的认为她想再见到你吗
Question is, do you really think
she wants to see you again?

387
00:23:40,141 --> 00:23:41,386
嗯？
Hmm?

388
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:45,936
其实我真正的才能是让别人输钱
Actually, my real talent
is costing other people money.

389
00:23:48,107 --> 00:23:50,183
你早就应该知道的，拉斯基
You ought to know that, Lesky.

390
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:54,689
你会输钱的，除非你朝我背后开枪
You're gonna lose that bet.
Unless you wanna shoot me in the back.

391
00:23:54,864 --> 00:23:56,856
不过对你来说也不是第一次了
Wouldrt be your first time.

392
00:23:58,701 --> 00:24:00,694
你为什么不了结这一切？
Why don't you just end it?

393
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:03,370
你在等什么？
What are you waiting for?

394
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:05,532
身边的人死去更多？
More people around you to die?

395
00:24:08,586 --> 00:24:09,997
你到底在等什么？
What are you waiting for?

396
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,880
最后一次，告诉我那些数字
For the last time,
give me the numbers.

397
00:24:32,068 --> 00:24:34,938
你是个勇敢的女孩，而且很聪明
You're a very brave girl, and clever.

398
00:24:37,198 --> 00:24:41,741
但你知道我们如何知道你的本事吗？
But do you know how we knew exactly
what you can do,

399
00:24:41,911 --> 00:24:43,950
你要在什么时间去什么地方
where you're going to be and when?

400
00:24:44,121 --> 00:24:46,612
- 有人告诉你了
- 对
- Someone told you.
- That's right.

401
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:49,950
猜猜是谁？
Can you guess who?

402
00:24:57,551 --> 00:25:01,252
你的朋友，告诉你关于你可怜母亲事情的人
Yourfriend, the one who told you
about your poor mother

403
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,222
将你从家里带走的流氓可不会告诉你那些
when the scum
who took you from home would not.

404
00:25:03,391 --> 00:25:06,226
她在帮我们做事
She's working for us with a smile.

405
00:25:07,144 --> 00:25:09,137
玲
Ling.

406
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,614
讲英语
In English.

407
00:25:30,042 --> 00:25:32,450
我说了，讲英语！
I said speak in English.

408
00:25:33,421 --> 00:25:35,413
怎么样？
Well?

409
00:25:37,383 --> 00:25:40,052
她不肯告诉我任何事
She won't tell me anything.

410
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,138
我的父亲很有耐心
My father is a patient man.

411
00:25:45,308 --> 00:25:46,588
我没有
I am not.

412
00:25:47,935 --> 00:25:49,310
告诉他他想知道的一切
Tell him what he wants to know.

413
00:25:49,478 --> 00:25:50,854
不然我就…
Or I'II...

414
00:25:51,022 --> 00:25:53,180
纽约警察！开门！
NYPD! Open the door!

415
00:25:53,357 --> 00:25:55,149
- 搞什么？
- 我们是警察
- What the hell?
- This is the police.

416
00:25:55,318 --> 00:25:58,817
我们接到报警说扰民
We got reports of a disturbance.

417
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,275
你可以选择配合或者硬来
Look, you can make this easy
or you can make it hard.

418
00:26:04,452 --> 00:26:07,025
开门，不然我们就要砸门了
Open the door or we come in by force.

419
00:26:07,204 --> 00:26:08,200
放屁
Bullshit, blue.

420
00:26:08,372 --> 00:26:11,658
你敢进来就别想活着出去，我以母亲之名发誓
You come in here, you go out feet first,
I swear on my mother.

421
00:26:15,629 --> 00:26:17,172
他们在里面，队长
Yeah, they're in there, Captain.

422
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:21,883
他们一点都不配合，你最好在事情失控前过来
They're not cooperating. You better
get down here before things go to hell.

423
00:26:22,053 --> 00:26:24,211
不行，这事闹大了
Negative, negative. This is big.

424
00:26:24,388 --> 00:26:27,389
我马上回警局指挥，我们再联系
I'm going back to the station to monitor
the city. I'll get back to you.

425
00:26:28,517 --> 00:26:30,676
好了，我们找到她了，你知道我想要什么
All right, we got 'em pinned down.
You know what I want.

426
00:26:30,853 --> 00:26:36,689
我们有言在先，抓到女孩，可以就活捉，不行就干掉
We have a deal. Get the girl,
alive if you can, dead if you can't.

427
00:26:36,859 --> 00:26:39,694
我们进去的话，布鲁克林上升10%，这是新的约定
<i>We go in, Brooklyrs take
goes up by 10%. That's the new deal.</i>

428
00:26:39,862 --> 00:26:42,187
等等，我有个电话要接
<i>Hold on, I got an incoming call.</i>

429
00:26:44,283 --> 00:26:47,450
- 嘿，埃米尔，怎么了？
- 把你的人弄走，混蛋
- Emile, what's up?
- Take your men off, Wolf.

430
00:26:47,662 --> 00:26:52,454
不管中国人给你什么，我都加5%
Whatever the Chinese offered to you,
I'll up it by 5%.

431
00:26:56,587 --> 00:26:58,378
把她带回来
Get her back here.

432
00:27:08,933 --> 00:27:10,131
好了，关
<i>All right, Quan,</i>

433
00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:13,061
俄罗斯人提供我布鲁克林7%
<i>I got the Russians
offering to up Brooklyrs take by 7%,</i>

434
00:27:13,229 --> 00:27:15,387
布朗克斯也一样，所以我不知道该怎么和你说
Bronx the same.
So I don't know what to tell you.

435
00:27:15,564 --> 00:27:17,687
我的手下，他们宁愿去打仗
My guys are willing
to go to war over this.

436
00:27:17,817 --> 00:27:20,224
卡在我们和俄国人之间
You're gonna be stuck between us
and the Russians like Hitler,

437
00:27:20,403 --> 00:27:23,772
就像希特勒双线作战，所以你要想清楚
fighting on two fronts,
so you better think hard about this one.

438
00:27:24,615 --> 00:27:27,533
10%，两个区域，最终提案
10%, both precincts, final offer.

439
00:27:38,254 --> 00:27:41,290
嘿，麦克，这两帮家伙都愿意
Hey, Mac. Both these bastards
are willing to pay a stiff price

440
00:27:41,465 --> 00:27:43,090
为这小姑娘出大价钱
for this little Chink girl.

441
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:46,260
- 不管她有什么，我想要
- 那我们的计划是？
<i>- Whatever she's got, I want it.
- So what's our play?</i>

442
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:48,884
我让俄国人放下武器，你们进去
<i>I get the Russians
to drop their guard, you go in.</i>

443
00:27:49,056 --> 00:27:51,512
如果她中枪了
<i>She catches a bullet,
I want you to take out every last one</i>

444
00:27:51,726 --> 00:27:53,220
你给我把布尔什维克的都干掉
<i>of those Bolshevik scumbags.</i>

445
00:27:54,478 --> 00:27:56,804
好的，埃米尔，你的提议不错
All right, Emile, your offer's good.

446
00:27:56,981 --> 00:28:00,231
我会让我的人撤走的，只因为我更喜欢你！
<i>I'm gonna call my guys off,
but only 'cause I like you better.</i>

447
00:28:00,401 --> 00:28:03,900
狗屁！你是个贪婪的混蛋，沃夫
Bullshit. You're a greedy bastard, Wolf.

448
00:28:04,071 --> 00:28:08,449
你的嗅觉很灵敏，你想把一切占为己有
You got the scent of something big
and now you want it all for yourself.

449
00:28:08,617 --> 00:28:12,532
不过我想在你派手下进来前告诉你些事情
But I have to tell you something before
you send your men in guns blazing.

450
00:28:13,581 --> 00:28:16,072
- 她不见了
- 你指什么，她不见了？
<i>- She's gone.
- What do you mean, she's gone?</i>

451
00:28:17,418 --> 00:28:21,795
她逃走了，你的人堵在外面我没法追她
<i>I mean she escaped, and with
all your men out there, I can't follow.</i>

452
00:28:21,964 --> 00:28:24,206
我提议在找到她之前我们停战
<i>I offeryou a truce until we find her.</i>

453
00:28:24,383 --> 00:28:26,874
我发誓，如果中国人先找到她
<i>Trust me, the Chinese find her first,</i>

454
00:28:27,053 --> 00:28:30,137
你会为此后悔一辈子的
<i>that will be a thing you regret
as long as you live.</i>

455
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,474
德切斯基，她到底知道些什么？
Docheski, what does she have?

456
00:28:34,644 --> 00:28:37,265
我们说定了吗，沃夫队长？
<i>Do we have a truce, Captain Wolf?</i>

457
00:28:39,857 --> 00:28:42,430
女孩是中国人，11岁
The girl is Chinese, 11 years old.

458
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,768
会说普通话和英语
She speaks Mandarin and English.

459
00:28:46,322 --> 00:28:47,899
照片已经下发
A photo is being disseminated.

460
00:28:48,074 --> 00:28:51,490
找到她后直接带她去中心大街
You are to find her
and bring her straight to Centre Street.

461
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:57,535
她在往地铁去
She's heading for subway.

462
00:29:59,603 --> 00:30:01,596
对不起，安妮
Sorry, Annie.

463
00:32:08,983 --> 00:32:11,652
俄国人的手机信号在J大街消失了
Lost my lock
on the Russian cell on Jay Street.

464
00:32:12,445 --> 00:32:16,277
听起来他们是进了地铁站
Sounds like they went into
the subway station. Manattan bound.

465
00:33:00,368 --> 00:33:01,363
嘿
Hey.

466
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,220
你？那个清洁工？
You? The garbage collector?

467
00:34:09,395 --> 00:34:11,637
你们的情报太糟糕了
You've got bad information.

468
00:34:11,814 --> 00:34:14,815
我从来不收垃圾
我只丢垃圾
I never collected garbage.
I disposed of it.

469
00:34:19,363 --> 00:34:22,779
别被吓得失眠了，他应得的
Don't lose sleep. He had it coming.

470
00:35:01,197 --> 00:35:02,193
你还好吗？
Are you all right?

471
00:35:05,284 --> 00:35:07,526
- 出去！出去！
- 快
- Get out! Get out!
- Move.

472
00:35:07,703 --> 00:35:09,696
没事了
It's OK.

473
00:35:25,388 --> 00:35:28,757
最后目击到女孩进了J大街地铁站，红色警报
<i>Girl was last seen entering
Jay Street Station. Red alert.</i>

474
00:35:28,933 --> 00:35:32,017
一旦找到，立刻带她到中央大街的沃夫队长这
<i>Once found, she needs to be brought
to Captain Wolf at Centre Street.</i>

475
00:35:32,186 --> 00:35:33,561
重复，红色警报
<i>Repeat, red alert.</i>

476
00:35:43,781 --> 00:35:47,280
嘿，孩子，我们是警察
Whoa. Easy. Easy there, hon.
We're the police.

477
00:35:47,451 --> 00:35:49,278
好了没事了
Everything's all right.

478
00:35:49,453 --> 00:35:51,446
你叫什么？孩子
Hey, what's your name, hon?

479
00:35:52,331 --> 00:35:53,327
就是她
This is her.

480
00:35:53,499 --> 00:35:55,326
我不知道，对我来说他们看起来都一样
I don't know. They all look alike to me.

481
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:57,209
- 你有那照片吗？
- 有，让我看看…
- You got that picture up?
- Yeah, let me see.

482
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,879
该死的纽约
Fucking New York City.

483
00:36:08,055 --> 00:36:10,048
好久没见到某些人的话
Don't see somebody for years.

484
00:36:10,224 --> 00:36:12,715
你一天会遇到他们两次
Then you bump into them twice
in the same day.

485
00:36:14,979 --> 00:36:18,146
我不会伤害你的，孩子
Hey, hey, hey. I'm not gonna hurt you.

486
00:36:25,948 --> 00:36:28,237
你到底做了什么，孩子？
What the hell did you do, kid?

487
00:36:44,884 --> 00:36:47,339
这些追你的都是坏人
You know, those men chasing you are bad.

488
00:36:47,511 --> 00:36:49,919
你能告诉我他们为什么追你吗
You wanna tell me why they're after you?

489
00:36:50,097 --> 00:36:52,090
你懂我在说什么吗？
You understand me?

490
00:36:53,351 --> 00:36:55,343
你会说英语吗？
Speak English?

491
00:37:38,562 --> 00:37:41,433
走另一边！都是车！
The other way! Cars go the other way!

492
00:37:51,951 --> 00:37:53,030
你疯了吗？
Are you a crazy man?

493
00:38:20,563 --> 00:38:22,555
坐稳了
Hold on.

494
00:38:29,196 --> 00:38:32,233
这样下去,很多无辜的人会受伤
If this goes on, a lot of
innocent people are gonna get hurt.

495
00:38:32,408 --> 00:38:33,986
你希望那样子吗?
You want that?

496
00:38:35,369 --> 00:38:36,947
很好！那就按我说的做
Good. Then do what I say.

497
00:39:15,409 --> 00:39:17,449
你还好吗？
You OK?

498
00:39:19,664 --> 00:39:21,122
我们走
Let's go.

499
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:23,283
我不是5岁小孩
I'm not five years old.

500
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,247
那就跟上
Then keep up

501
00:39:47,692 --> 00:39:51,357
- 你们找到后又跟丢了？
- 不，队长，我们没有跟丢她
- You had her and you lost her.
- No, Captain, we didn't lose her.

502
00:39:51,529 --> 00:39:52,809
她被抢走了
She was taken by force.

503
00:39:52,989 --> 00:39:56,073
- 俄国人？
- 不是俄国人
<i>- The Russians?
- No, not the Russians.</i>

504
00:39:56,867 --> 00:39:58,492
好吧…
Well...

505
00:39:58,661 --> 00:40:00,653
- 是路克・莱特
- 什么？
- It was Luke Wright.
- What?

506
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:03,368
- 沃夫队长
- 等会，大卫
- Captain Wolf?
- Not now, David.

507
00:40:03,541 --> 00:40:05,533
市长想找你，队长
The mayor wants you, Captain.

508
00:40:06,752 --> 00:40:09,243
- 把他接到2线
- 不是电话
- Put him through on two.
- He's not on the phone.

509
00:40:09,922 --> 00:40:11,879
他想让你去大厦…昨天
He wants you at the mansion, yesterday.

510
00:40:13,718 --> 00:40:15,710
给您
There you go.

511
00:40:18,389 --> 00:40:20,880
- 谢谢，伊万诺夫先生
- 谢谢
- Thank you, Mr Ivanov.
- Thank you.

512
00:40:30,234 --> 00:40:34,148
伊万诺夫先生？给您，伊万诺夫先生，1012号房间
Mr Ivanov?
Here you are, Mr Ivanov. Room 1012.

513
00:40:34,322 --> 00:40:36,610
- 10楼
- 谢谢
- Tenth Floor.
- Thank you.

514
00:40:55,509 --> 00:40:58,000
你喜欢高档酒店？
You like a nice hotel.

515
00:40:58,179 --> 00:41:00,171
我从来没住过高档酒店
I've never stayed in a nice hotel.

516
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,216
所以没人会到这种地方找我们
No one's gonna look for us in one.

517
00:41:20,326 --> 00:41:22,318
多想现在洗个澡啊
Would I love a shower right now.

518
00:41:23,245 --> 00:41:25,238
你可以洗的
You could use one.

519
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:32,747
我大可以让俄国人把你带下列车
I could have just let those Russians
grab you on the train.

520
00:41:36,175 --> 00:41:38,049
那你为什么要救我？
Why did you save me?

521
00:41:40,805 --> 00:41:43,841
我没救你…是你救了我
I didn't save you. You saved me.

522
00:41:44,976 --> 00:41:46,968
我只是作为回报
I'm paying you back.

523
00:41:48,104 --> 00:41:49,646
我叫路克
My name's Luke.

524
00:41:52,024 --> 00:41:53,187
梅
Mei.

525
00:41:56,612 --> 00:41:58,605
你有父母吗，梅？
You have parents, Mei?

526
00:42:00,241 --> 00:42:02,862
- 我有父亲
- 他叫什么?
- I have a father.
- What's his name?

527
00:42:03,035 --> 00:42:05,028
张关
Chang Quan.

528
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:09,032
张关？
Chang Quan?

529
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:12,330
如果我们是在说同一个人的话
If we're talking about the same guy,

530
00:42:12,503 --> 00:42:14,994
据我所知他根本没孩子
he didn't have any kids
last time I checked.

531
00:42:15,172 --> 00:42:17,331
这没道理，他不可能有像你那么大的孩子
Any made since
wouldn't be a day over three years old.

532
00:42:18,259 --> 00:42:19,919
我是领养的
I'm adopted.

533
00:42:20,636 --> 00:42:22,629
他从老家带你来这的？
He bring you overfrom back home?

534
00:42:28,352 --> 00:42:30,392
张不像是个做父亲的人
Chang isn't the fatherly type.

535
00:42:30,604 --> 00:42:32,478
你为什么来这，梅？
Why are you here, Mei?

536
00:42:33,899 --> 00:42:35,892
做会计
To count.

537
00:42:41,324 --> 00:42:44,739
你是被张的老板，那个老家伙送来的？他叫什么？
You were sent over by the old guy,
Chang's boss. What's his name?

538
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:48,362
没有电脑，没有电子资料
Old school.
No computers, no electronic trails.

539
00:42:48,539 --> 00:42:50,615
只有你脑子里的东西，是吗？
Just what you have
in your head, right?

540
00:43:02,845 --> 00:43:05,336
- 你知道韩礁吗？
- 我知道他
- You know Jiao Han?
- I know of him.

541
00:43:06,474 --> 00:43:09,640
他告诉了我一个数字，非常长的一个数字
He told me a number,
a very long number.

542
00:43:09,769 --> 00:43:13,268
我本来要去个地方拿下个数字和指示
I was going someplace where I would get
another number and more instructions,

543
00:43:13,439 --> 00:43:15,728
但是俄国人现身杀了所有人
but the Russian came and shot everyone.

544
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,307
之后警察又出现了，我就逃走了
Then the police came and I ran away.

545
00:43:18,486 --> 00:43:21,190
现在你知道一切了，高兴了吗？
Now you know everything.
Happiness for you?

546
00:43:24,825 --> 00:43:26,699
想回去找韩礁吗？
You wanna go back to Han Jiao?

547
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,115
我造成了太多麻烦
生意搞砸了
I make too much trouble. Bad business.

548
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:34,161
事成之后，他会杀掉我，真是如意算盘
After I do what he asks, he kills me.
Good business.

549
00:43:34,335 --> 00:43:36,493
那么，这组数字是什么？
So what about this number?

550
00:43:36,671 --> 00:43:39,755
一个又长又无聊的数字，我可以告诉你
It's a long, boring number.
I can tell it to you.

551
00:43:40,675 --> 00:43:43,047
对我来说毫无意义
It wouldn't mean anything to me.

552
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:45,792
你怎么知道是一个数字而非一堆独立数字呢？
How do you know it's one number
and not a bunch of separate numbers?

553
00:43:48,933 --> 00:43:52,681
你是个疯子，但是倒不蠢
You're a crazy man but not so stupid.

554
00:43:53,688 --> 00:43:56,688
这些数字对你来说有何特别吗？
Is there anything interesting to you
about these numbers?

555
00:43:56,816 --> 00:43:59,900
- 或许有点
- 为什么？
- Maybe a few of them.
- Why?

556
00:44:00,069 --> 00:44:03,023
因为他们都是3或者7开头
Because they have a three or a seven
before them.

557
00:44:03,197 --> 00:44:04,905
所有数字都是随机的
All the numbers are random,

558
00:44:05,074 --> 00:44:09,321
但当中5个是7开头的，8个是3开头的
but five of them has a seven before
and eight of them has a three before.

559
00:44:09,495 --> 00:44:11,986
对于随机数来说这频率太高
That's too many times to be random.

560
00:44:12,164 --> 00:44:14,490
这是个密码
It's a code.

561
00:44:14,709 --> 00:44:17,413
- 还有呢？
- 没了
- What else?
- Nothing.

562
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:20,629
那么，这些3和7是比较有用的
So the three and the seven
are interesting

563
00:44:20,798 --> 00:44:23,206
因为他们随机出现了太多次？
because they happen too many times
to be random.

564
00:44:24,051 --> 00:44:27,171
因为它们不是数字，是单词
Because they're not numbers.
They're words.

565
00:44:27,346 --> 00:44:29,718
从左到右或者从右到左
Right left or left right.

566
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:33,094
老手法了，保险箱的密码
Old school. Combination to a safe.

567
00:44:44,447 --> 00:44:45,561
在这个酒店里？
In the hotel?

568
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:47,364
哪？
Where?

569
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,752
大概5尺11寸，褐色头发，30岁左右
About five eleven, brown hair, 30s.

570
00:45:07,887 --> 00:45:10,045
大概几小时前来的
Probably came in here
less than a few hours ago.

571
00:45:10,222 --> 00:45:12,132
先生，我们不允许透露顾客信息
Sir, we're not allowed
to discuss our guests.

572
00:45:12,308 --> 00:45:14,597
那么，他确实是客人了？他入住了吗？
So he's a guest? Did he check in?

573
00:45:14,769 --> 00:45:16,477
对不起，先生，我们不能…
I'm sorry, sir.
We're not at liberty to...

574
00:45:16,646 --> 00:45:19,183
他和一个中国女孩在一起，11岁
He would have been with a Chinese girl,
11 years old.

575
00:45:19,357 --> 00:45:22,192
我是她的父亲，我很担心她
I'm herfather
and I'm very worried about her.

576
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:25,942
真抱歉，我可以帮你报警
I'm so sorry.
I can call the police for you.

577
00:45:26,656 --> 00:45:28,399
你敢报警我杀了你
Do that and I blow your brains out.

578
00:45:29,617 --> 00:45:30,613
- 现在…
- 别动
- Now...
- Don't move.

579
00:45:30,785 --> 00:45:32,065
他在哪个房间？
...what room is he in?

580
00:45:32,912 --> 00:45:35,154
哪个房间？
<i>What room is he in?</i>

581
00:45:38,084 --> 00:45:41,250
我想…他是在10楼
I think maybe
I put him on the 10th floor.

582
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:43,413
哪个房间？
Room.

583
00:45:44,173 --> 00:45:46,415
我发誓，他没有带着一个小女孩
I swear he didn't have
a little girl with him.

584
00:45:46,592 --> 00:45:49,213
- 房间
- 我需要查一下
- Room.
- I just need to check.

585
00:45:49,387 --> 00:45:52,423
那就快查，或者我给你一枪
Then check quick
or I put a bullet in your brain.

586
00:45:52,598 --> 00:45:54,591
- 快
- 把手举起来
- Quick.
- Put your hands up.

587
00:45:56,811 --> 00:45:59,812
- 你不会想这么做的
- 把手举高让我看见
- You don't want any part of this.
- Hands up so I can see 'em.

588
00:46:14,996 --> 00:46:16,953
没人可以离开这酒店
No one leaves the hotel!

589
00:46:17,123 --> 00:46:18,700
快点！
Come on!

590
00:46:18,874 --> 00:46:21,247
1012，他在1012房
1012. He's in room 1012.

591
00:46:21,419 --> 00:46:24,206
我以为你说没人会到这里找我们
I thought you said
no one would look for us here.

592
00:46:25,214 --> 00:46:27,123
我把它关掉了，没人能打进来
I turned it off
so no one could call when I was...

593
00:46:27,299 --> 00:46:28,628
它不需要被开着
It doesn't need to be on.

594
00:46:30,219 --> 00:46:32,128
- 回去！
- 等等！
- Get back!
- Wait!

595
00:46:32,305 --> 00:46:33,882
都给我趴在地上！
Get down on the floor.

596
00:46:39,145 --> 00:46:40,473
所有人回去！
Everybody back!

597
00:46:40,646 --> 00:46:41,677
写下那些数字
Write down the numbers,

598
00:46:41,856 --> 00:46:44,561
那些3和7开头的，快！
just the ones with the three
and the seven in front of 'em, quick.

599
00:46:45,901 --> 00:46:48,737
你！过来这里！趴下！趴下！
You, get over there! Get down! Get down!

600
00:46:52,241 --> 00:46:53,735
我会想办法带你去安全的地方
I'll try to get you someplace safe.

601
00:46:53,909 --> 00:46:56,151
如果我们分开了，别说你跟我说过什么！
We get separated,
don't tell them you told me anything.

602
00:46:56,329 --> 00:46:59,863
- 梅，如果他们试图吓唬你…
- 试图？我已经被吓到了！
- Mei, if they try to scare you...
- Try? I'm so scared already.

603
00:47:00,041 --> 00:47:01,583
嗯，我也是，记住，撒谎！
Yeah, me to. Remember, lie.

604
00:47:01,751 --> 00:47:02,996
我们快到了
We're almost there.

605
00:47:03,169 --> 00:47:05,411
如果你们看到他们下楼，小心别杀了那个女孩
If you see them downstairs,
try not to kill the girl.

606
00:47:13,638 --> 00:47:16,045
进去
Back inside.

607
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:23,474
跟上他们！我下楼去断他们退路！
Follow them!
I'm going back down to cut them off.

608
00:48:00,726 --> 00:48:03,182
警察来了，顶住他们直到我下令撤退！
The cops are here.
Hold them off until I give the word.

609
00:48:03,354 --> 00:48:05,014
别让他们进来
Do not let them in!

610
00:48:33,551 --> 00:48:36,256
所有人给我趴下，你们走不了了
Everybody stay down!
You ain't going nowhere! Stay!

611
00:48:36,429 --> 00:48:39,346
嘿！你去哪？回去！站住！蹲下！都回去！
Hey, where you going?
Get down! No! Get back down!

612
00:48:39,515 --> 00:48:42,267
- 回去！
- 快！快！
- Get back!
- Move! Move!

613
00:49:38,407 --> 00:49:40,316
起来！所有人起来！
Get up! Everybody up!

614
00:49:40,493 --> 00:49:43,363
我们要离开酒店了，起来！
We're getting out of the hotel. Up!

615
00:49:43,537 --> 00:49:46,455
站起来，不然我就开枪了！站起来！
Up or I start shooting you! Up!

616
00:49:48,751 --> 00:49:51,372
58号转角，我们发现嫌疑犯
Moving to corner of 58.
We got a suspect.

617
00:49:51,545 --> 00:49:53,787
别动！
Hey, don't move!

618
00:49:53,964 --> 00:49:55,957
别动！
Don't move!

619
00:50:03,057 --> 00:50:05,630
走！往那走！
Move! Move! Over there! Go!

620
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:10,721
到街上去，别停！谁不听话下场就是这样！
Into the street and keep moving!
Anyone who doesn't dies like this!

621
00:50:13,401 --> 00:50:14,480
到街上去
Into the street!

622
00:50:16,988 --> 00:50:19,443
重复，别开枪！
Repeat, hold your fire!

623
00:50:20,241 --> 00:50:21,439
那些都是平民！
They're civilians!

624
00:50:34,922 --> 00:50:38,920
嫌犯在人群中，嫌犯在人群中
Suspect is in the crowd.
Suspect is in the crowd.

625
00:50:44,849 --> 00:50:46,260
嘿！给我站住！
Hey, stop right there!

626
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:18,590
嘿，你干什么！
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

627
00:51:22,136 --> 00:51:25,422
我的车！做点什么！他抢了我的车！
That's my car!
Do something, he took my fucking car!

628
00:51:39,403 --> 00:51:41,396
往市中心开，我过一会告诉你地址
Head downtown.
I'll give you an address in a minute.

629
00:51:58,839 --> 00:52:00,832
靠
Shit.

630
00:52:08,015 --> 00:52:11,016
- 嘿，朋友！可以告诉我地址了吗？
- 等一下
- Hey, buddy, you wanna give me address?
- In a minute. Just hold on.

631
00:53:31,515 --> 00:53:35,560
他回来了？路克・莱特回到我的城市了？
He's here? Luke Wright is back
in the city, in my city?

632
00:53:35,728 --> 00:53:37,436
他已经回来有一段时间了
<i>He's been back for a while.</i>

633
00:53:37,605 --> 00:53:39,763
- 一段时间？多久？
- 可能一年，这很难说
- A while? What's a while?
- Maybe a year. It's hard to say.

634
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:41,980
挂掉电话！
Turn that goddamn thing off.

635
00:53:43,361 --> 00:53:45,437
- 亚历克斯
- 朋友们
- Alex.
- Guys.

636
00:53:45,613 --> 00:53:47,605
是，对不起，市长
Yes, sir. Sorry, Your Honour.

637
00:53:49,825 --> 00:53:52,316
发生了什么，沃夫？路克・莱特又是怎么卷进来的？
What's going on, Wolf?
And how's Luke Wright involved in it?

638
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:54,571
我本来也想问你这个问题
I figured I might ask you
the same question.

639
00:53:54,747 --> 00:53:56,740
别和我玩游戏
Don't try to game me.

640
00:53:57,833 --> 00:53:59,292
你不过就是个马前卒
You're nothing but a pawn

641
00:53:59,418 --> 00:54:01,790
下着一盘你无法掌控的大棋
playing on a board so big
you can't even see the edge.

642
00:54:01,962 --> 00:54:03,836
仅此而已
That's all you've ever been.

643
00:54:04,006 --> 00:54:07,375
直到5分钟前我都比你更了解路克・莱特
I knew about Luke Wright, which is more
than you can say until five minutes ago.

644
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:10,345
你所知的路克・莱特
What you know about Luke Wright

645
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:13,679
还不到浩瀚资料中的一小片段
rates less than a paragraph
in a very fat book.

646
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,596
世贸大厦倒下后
After the towers fell

647
00:54:15,768 --> 00:54:18,722
我们的人都分散出去追寻恐怖活动
and our manpower was spread out
tracking terrorist activity,

648
00:54:18,896 --> 00:54:20,687
是我组织了特勤队
I was the one
who formed the special task force

649
00:54:20,856 --> 00:54:22,648
惩治犯罪以填补缺口
to deal with the crime
that was filling the gap.

650
00:54:22,817 --> 00:54:26,233
别忘了也是我让你来管理这支队伍
And don't you ever fucking forget that
I was the one who put you in charge.

651
00:54:26,404 --> 00:54:28,895
我从来没忘记…我的工作成就了你的市长
I didn't forget. My work made you mayor.

652
00:54:29,073 --> 00:54:30,733
你的工作？
Your work?

653
00:54:30,908 --> 00:54:33,660
你以为路克只是你警察中的一员？
You think Luke
was just one of your cops?

654
00:54:33,828 --> 00:54:36,116
当我拉起队伍时，我知道它需要一面刀锋
When I put together your team,
I knew it needed an edge

655
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:39,865
普通警探无法胜任，得像手术刀刀锋一般
no ordinary detectives could give me,
something surgical.

656
00:54:40,793 --> 00:54:44,376
我拜托那些甚至不存在于官方记录中的朋友
I called friends in places buried
so deep they don't officially exist.

657
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:49,209
他们很同情我，一周后他们送来了路克・莱特
They were sympathetic.
A week later they sent Luke Wright.

658
00:54:49,969 --> 00:54:52,211
那些过去七年里消失的自作聪明的家伙
Those wise guys who vanished
over the last seven years,

659
00:54:52,388 --> 00:54:54,381
你以为他们死于自相残杀？
you think that was internecine war?

660
00:54:55,349 --> 00:54:57,638
你在哈林区排水沟里找到的可卡因
Those coke kings
you found in the gutter in Harlem.

661
00:54:57,810 --> 00:55:01,261
布鲁克林的弗雷迪・彼得罗维奇，中国城的汤米・劳
Freddy Petrovich in Brooklyn.
Tommy Lau in Chinatown.

662
00:55:01,439 --> 00:55:03,147
路克・莱特是个幽灵
Luke Wright is a ghost.

663
00:55:04,275 --> 00:55:06,267
非常致命的幽灵
A very deadly ghost.

664
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:10,063
而且工作很效率
It worked like a charm too.

665
00:55:10,906 --> 00:55:14,489
然后你们这帮混蛋就忙着捞钱了
Then you dicks had to get greedy
and pad your pockets.

666
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:18,076
路克是个杀手，但是个诚实的杀手
Luke's a killer, but he's an honest one.

667
00:55:18,247 --> 00:55:20,738
当他威胁说要把向情报局告发一切时
When he threatened to take
the whole thing to IA,

668
00:55:20,916 --> 00:55:23,538
当时确实费了很大的劲
it took some people with a lot of bronze
stuck to their pyjamas

669
00:55:23,711 --> 00:55:24,909
才搞定他
to talk him off the ledge.

670
00:55:25,087 --> 00:55:27,792
如果我的队伍解散，我们就又变回苦力了
Yeah, my team gets dismantled.
We're peons again.

671
00:55:27,965 --> 00:55:29,376
但是如果路克・莱特有这么深背景
But if Luke Wright's so connected,

672
00:55:29,508 --> 00:55:32,260
为什么他会沦落到在泽西打拳击
how does he wind up in Jersey
cage fighting on the B circuit?

673
00:55:33,387 --> 00:55:35,546
我看起来像心理医生吗？
Do I look like a shrink?

674
00:55:35,723 --> 00:55:37,929
动员起所有人来
Get everybody on this.

675
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:39,760
一旦路克・莱特有了目标
Once Luke Wright gets on a roll,

676
00:55:39,935 --> 00:55:41,928
整个城市只有一个人能在
一对一中和他抗衡
only one man in this city
can take him on one-on-one.

677
00:55:42,104 --> 00:55:43,219
打扰了,我知道我不该打扰你们
I know this is a closed door,

678
00:55:43,397 --> 00:55:47,312
但是市中心一座酒店发生了大规模枪战
but there was just a major gun battle
downtown at a hotel.

679
00:55:47,485 --> 00:55:50,402
媒体都疯了,您需要赶紧做一份声明
Media's going nuts.
You're gonna need to make a statement.

680
00:55:51,989 --> 00:55:54,196
韩礁现在也在城里
Han Jiao is in the city also.

681
00:55:54,408 --> 00:55:57,742
他给了那个中国女孩一些东西,我不知道的东西
He give this little Chinese girl
something, I don't know what.

682
00:55:57,912 --> 00:55:59,536
路克・莱特在我之前带走了她
Luke Wright grabbed her before I could.

683
00:55:59,705 --> 00:56:00,903
- 什么？
- 我说路克・莱特
- What?
- I said Luke Wright...

684
00:56:01,082 --> 00:56:03,620
知道了，我一开始就听到了
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I heard you the first time.

685
00:56:07,755 --> 00:56:09,249
关闭曼哈顿的每一个出口
Close every exit out of Manattan.

686
00:56:09,423 --> 00:56:12,958
确保莱特和那个女孩逃不出去
Make sure that neither Wright or the
girl gets away, you get commissioner.

687
00:56:13,135 --> 00:56:17,465
放跑了...你就找把铲子自掘坟墓吧
Let 'em go... you get a shovel
to dig your own grave.

688
00:56:18,724 --> 00:56:21,346
那个女孩绝不能离开这个城市
That girl does not leave this city.

689
00:57:30,963 --> 00:57:33,917
我们找到了女孩，但是信息可能已经被泄漏
We recovered the girl, but the
information might have been compromised.

690
00:57:34,091 --> 00:57:36,582
- 我们要改下时间表吗？
- 不可能
<i>- Should we change our time frame?
- lmpossible.</i>

691
00:57:36,761 --> 00:57:38,919
现在整件事情已经失控了
Now that the whole damn thing
has gone supernova,

692
00:57:39,096 --> 00:57:41,303
今晚一定要了结此事
it's going to happen
and it's gonna happen tonight.

693
00:57:41,515 --> 00:57:43,058
会面地点要改下
But the meeting place
needs to be changed.

694
00:57:43,225 --> 00:57:45,799
- 到哪？
- 我会告诉你的
- Where to?
- I'll let you know.

695
00:57:45,978 --> 00:57:47,971
这里！就这里！
Here. Right here.

696
00:57:53,527 --> 00:57:56,694
慢点，停车
Slow down. Stop the car.

697
00:57:56,864 --> 00:58:00,198
不行，不行，别把妓女带上我的车子
No, no, you don't bring
no hookers in my cab, man.

698
00:58:01,452 --> 00:58:03,445
继续打你的表
Just keep the meter running.

699
00:58:07,458 --> 00:58:09,664
小姐们
Ladies.

700
00:58:09,835 --> 00:58:11,828
去喝一杯如何？
How about a drink?

701
00:58:19,387 --> 00:58:21,379
晚上好
Good evening.

702
00:58:21,555 --> 00:58:23,382
- 晚上好
- 想在这里吃晚餐吗？
- Evening.
- Will you be joining us for dinner?

703
00:58:23,557 --> 00:58:26,131
- 我们没有预定
- 没事的
- We don't have a reservation.
- That's OK.

704
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:30,094
今晚虽然很忙，但是我们应该能给你们找到位置
We're busy tonight, but we should
be able to find you something.

705
00:58:31,649 --> 00:58:35,148
楼下已经没有空位了，不过背后还有些
We don't have any tables downstairs,
but there are some in the back.

706
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,811
或者如果你们喜欢的话，去楼上也可以
Or you could sit upstairs if you like.

707
00:58:45,621 --> 00:58:49,950
先生？您怎么看？先生？
Sir? Sir?
Do you have a preference? Sir?

708
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:51,668
我们就在吧台喝点酒
I think we'll just get a drink
at the bar.

709
00:58:55,506 --> 00:58:57,712
你亲我一下然后转身出去
I want you to give me a kiss,
turn round and walk out of here.

710
00:58:57,883 --> 00:59:00,588
- 但是我以为
- 就像你忘记了什么东西一样
- But I thought...
- Just act like you forgot something.

711
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,130
只是不要再回来了
Only don't come back.

712
00:59:14,525 --> 00:59:18,024
来杯白俄罗斯，还有把叉子
Give me a white Russian, please,
and a fork.

713
00:59:18,195 --> 00:59:20,603
- 叉子？
- 就那样的
- Fork?
- One of those.

714
00:59:57,777 --> 01:00:00,184
他开的什么车？停在哪？
What does he drive
and where is it parked?

715
01:00:02,907 --> 01:00:05,149
外面小路上的一辆银色的SUV
A silver SUV in the alley outside.

716
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:22,510
- 瓦西里
- 打错了
<i>- Vassily.
- Not even close.</i>

717
01:00:24,011 --> 01:00:25,007
你是谁？
Who is this?

718
01:00:25,179 --> 01:00:27,302
整晚都在屠戮你手下的人，埃米尔
The guy who's been
killing your boys all night, Emile.

719
01:00:27,473 --> 01:00:30,593
你的儿子在我手里
The guy who has your son tied up
in a very dark place.

720
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:32,556
听好，我想要…
Now, here's what I want.

721
01:00:32,728 --> 01:00:34,353
你以为我会关心你想要什么？
<i>You think I give a shit
of what you want?</i>

722
01:00:34,522 --> 01:00:36,847
你以为抓了瓦西里就能敲诈我？
Do you think you can blackmail me
because you have Vassily?

723
01:00:37,024 --> 01:00:39,729
- 杀了他，下地狱去吧
- 我会下地狱的
<i>- Kill him and go to hell.
- I'm going to hell all right.</i>

724
01:00:39,902 --> 01:00:42,227
不过我不会杀了你儿子
<i>But I'm not gonna kill your boy.</i>

725
01:00:42,405 --> 01:00:44,896
我会把他带在身边，就像宠物一样
<i>I'm gonna keep him around, like a pet.</i>

726
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:47,743
我对待宠物可不友善
A very badly treated pet.

727
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:49,819
我会做一些让我以后每次照镜子
I'm gonna do things to him
that'll make me ashamed

728
01:00:49,996 --> 01:00:53,115
都觉得屈辱的事情，但是我会这么做的
<i>to look in the mirror afterward,
but I will do them.</i>

729
01:00:53,833 --> 01:00:57,284
瓦西里会告诉我所有他所知道的
<i>Vassily's gonna tell me everything
he knows about your operation.</i>

730
01:00:57,461 --> 01:01:00,131
然后你准备怎么做？报警？
And then what you gonna do?
Tell the police?

731
01:01:01,173 --> 01:01:04,625
- 你在搞笑吗？
- 我之前有提到过警察吗？
- You want me to laugh?
- Who said anything about the police?

732
01:01:04,802 --> 01:01:06,960
我会把这些信息与你的竞争对手分享
I'm gonna share the information
with the competition,

733
01:01:07,138 --> 01:01:08,798
我还没干掉的那些家伙
the ones I haven't already killed.

734
01:01:08,973 --> 01:01:11,428
我会拿光你所有的东西
<i>Anything they don't take from you,
I will.</i>

735
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,886
首先我会带走你漂亮的老婆
<i>First I'm gonna take your trophy wife.</i>

736
01:01:15,062 --> 01:01:18,016
然后是你的孩子们
<i>Then I'm gonna take
your trophy children.</i>

737
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:19,733
我会让你一无所有
<i>I'm gonna leave you with nothing.</i>

738
01:01:19,859 --> 01:01:22,350
当我完事后，你就什么都不是了
When I'm done, you won't even be
a memory of a memory.

739
01:01:23,571 --> 01:01:26,940
- 不过这些都没必要发生
- 你想要什么？
<i>- But that doesn't have to happen.
- What do you want?</i>

740
01:01:27,908 --> 01:01:30,150
- 我想知道保险箱里有什么
- 什么保险箱？
- I wanna know what's in the safe.
- What safe?

741
01:01:30,328 --> 01:01:33,447
那个女孩给我密码的那个保险箱
The safe the girl gave me
the combination to. That safe.

742
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:37,742
三千万美元
<i>$30 million.</i>

743
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:42,291
那孩子本来要去拿第二个密码，第二个保险箱里有什么？
Kid was on her way to get a second
number. What's in the second safe?

744
01:01:43,341 --> 01:01:46,959
值三千万美元的东西
<i>Something won'th $30 million.</i>

745
01:01:47,136 --> 01:01:49,461
- 给谁？
- 不知道
<i>- To who?
- No idea.</i>

746
01:01:50,848 --> 01:01:53,304
那是因为你只有小聪明，埃米尔
That's 'cause
you're only half-smart, Emile.

747
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:57,221
那么，我们这么说定了…
So here's the deal.

748
01:01:57,396 --> 01:02:00,101
你告诉我第一个保险箱在哪，我拿了钱就放你儿子
You tell me where the first safe is,
I take the money and let your boy go.

749
01:02:00,274 --> 01:02:03,026
骗我的话你就死定了，说到做到
<i>Lie to me and yourworld ends.
You have my word on that.</i>

750
01:02:03,194 --> 01:02:07,238
白痴！我知道一个人是否独行
Idiot. I know
when a man is working alone

751
01:02:07,406 --> 01:02:09,862
而你正好只身一人
and you're as alone as one can be.

752
01:02:10,034 --> 01:02:12,951
你需要一支队伍才能靠近保险箱
You need a small army
to get near that safe,

753
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:15,279
我有这种队伍
the kind of army I have.

754
01:02:15,456 --> 01:02:19,406
曾经有过！我时间不多
Had. It's been shrinking by the minute.

755
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:23,457
最后一次机会，否则我就挂电话修理你儿子了
<i>Last chance before I hang up
and go to work on your son.</i>

756
01:02:28,094 --> 01:02:30,086
你要杀我吗，收垃圾的？
Going to kill me, garbage man?

757
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:34,966
你那天就可以把我们都干掉的，是吗？
You could have taken us out that day,
couldn't you?

758
01:02:35,142 --> 01:02:37,265
但是你只是跪在那里
But you just sat there,

759
01:02:37,436 --> 01:02:40,141
让我们毁掉你，让你变得一无是处
let us ruin you,
let us make you nothing.

760
01:02:40,314 --> 01:02:44,442
我猜是保险箱给了你新的动力，是吗，收垃圾的？
I guess finding out about that safe gave
you new motivation, eh garbage man?

761
01:02:45,653 --> 01:02:48,060
如果我是你就不会浪费口舌
I wouldn't spend my time talking
if I were you.

762
01:02:48,823 --> 01:02:53,152
会祈祷事情结束时，那小女孩还活着
Spend it praying that when this is over
that little girl's still alive.

763
01:02:56,998 --> 01:02:58,990
祈祷！
Pray.

764
01:03:07,258 --> 01:03:08,254
时间地点？
When and where?

765
01:03:08,426 --> 01:03:11,510
桥下的地下道，一小时后
<i>The underpass under the bridge,
one hour.</i>

766
01:03:15,308 --> 01:03:19,222
对不起，那些俄国人出现时我用枪指着你
I'm sorry I pointed a gun at you
when the Russians attacked us, Mei.

767
01:03:20,646 --> 01:03:22,603
- 那只是…
- 生意而已…我知道的
- It was...
- Business. I know.

768
01:03:22,773 --> 01:03:25,181
很好，很好，你理解
It's good. It's good you understand.

769
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:27,435
我们会搞定这一切
We're going to get this done

770
01:03:27,611 --> 01:03:29,853
然后你跟我和韩叔一起就安全了
and you'll be safe
with me and Uncle Han.

771
01:03:31,657 --> 01:03:33,199
我保证做一个好父亲
I promise to be a better father to you

772
01:03:33,367 --> 01:03:35,526
比那个抛弃你和你母亲的家伙更好
than the one
who left you and your mother.

773
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:41,959
这个世界上没人比我更关心你
There's no one in the world
who cares more about you.

774
01:03:43,294 --> 01:03:45,500
你知道的，是吗？
You know that, don't you?

775
01:04:14,909 --> 01:04:17,198
人都到了
Well, the gang's all here.

776
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:19,161
差不多
Almost.

777
01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:22,580
- 伯尼生病了？
- 他在医院，混蛋！
- Reddick have to call in sick?
- He's in the hospital, dickhead.

778
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:26,451
- 你打坏了他的气管
- 我从来不知道气管还能被打坏
- You broke his trachea.
- I didn't know a trachea could break.

779
01:04:26,629 --> 01:04:28,586
- 希望他们能修好
- 是吗！不如让我先修理你？
- Hope they can fix it.
- Yeah? How about I fix you?

780
01:04:28,756 --> 01:04:31,329
嘿！嘿！嘿！嘿！别这样！
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Not here.

781
01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:36,003
好久不见，路克，不过我并不想念你
It's been a while, Luke.
Can't say I missed you.

782
01:04:37,515 --> 01:04:41,347
- 那么，有话直说吧
- 带了我要的东西没？
- So, let's get down to business.
- Did you bring what I asked for?

783
01:04:45,773 --> 01:04:48,015
- 托斯卡尼的
- 还有呢？
- Toscanni's.
- Where else?

784
01:05:04,959 --> 01:05:07,366
味道不错！
Mmm. That's good.

785
01:05:21,809 --> 01:05:23,802
我整晚都在餐馆里
Been in restaurants all night.

786
01:05:24,895 --> 01:05:26,888
但是他们提供给我的都是子弹
All I got served was lead.

787
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:36,149
- 有火吗？
- 去你的！
- Anyone got a light?
- You know what? Screw this.

788
01:05:36,324 --> 01:05:38,779
听着，队长，你让我们过来，我们过来了
Look, Captain, you asked us
to come here, so we came.

789
01:05:38,993 --> 01:05:41,614
但我不会站在这里听这混蛋胡扯
But I ain't gonna sit here
and listen to this scumbag's big mouth.

790
01:05:41,787 --> 01:05:43,780
闭嘴，科夫克斯！
Shut up, Kolfax.

791
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:46,911
还没戒烟，哈？
Still haven't quit, huh?

792
01:05:57,386 --> 01:06:00,008
嘿，嘿，这是什么？
Hey. Hey, what the hell is that?

793
01:06:00,181 --> 01:06:02,173
装有三千万美元保险箱的密码
Combination of the safe
with 30 million bucks in it.

794
01:06:02,350 --> 01:06:04,841
- 哇，哇！你在干嘛？
- 你个狗屎
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Filthy piece of shit.

795
01:06:05,019 --> 01:06:07,936
现在这密码存在我脑子里了
The only place it exists now is in here.

796
01:06:08,105 --> 01:06:10,643
当你们手痒想扣扳机时，记住这点
Remember that next time
your little triggerfinger gets itchy.

797
01:06:10,816 --> 01:06:12,061
为什么韩礁会把它藏在
Why would Han Jiou stash it

798
01:06:12,234 --> 01:06:14,808
中国城最繁忙的赌窝里？
right in the middle of Chinatowrs
busiest gambling den?

799
01:06:15,029 --> 01:06:17,187
因为伯努瓦这样的喜欢
Because of sleaze-bucket cops
like you, Benoit,

800
01:06:17,365 --> 01:06:19,903
去赌窝收保护费腐败警察
who collect off of Chinatowrs
busiest gambling den.

801
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:22,483
想不吸引警察的注意
Where else would he surround it
with dozens of armed man

802
01:06:22,662 --> 01:06:24,239
他还能放在哪里？
without attracting police attention?

803
01:06:24,413 --> 01:06:27,865
队长,我们怎么知道这混蛋不是在玩我们？他是个流浪汉！
Captain, why do we know this son of
a bitch on the level, huh? He's a bum.

804
01:06:28,042 --> 01:06:30,035
你从哪得到的消息？
Where'd you get your information?

805
01:06:30,961 --> 01:06:33,038
今晚会有个交易
There's an exchange happening tonight.

806
01:06:33,172 --> 01:06:35,330
三合会半数交易额都在赌场保险箱里
The Triad half of the deal
is in a safe in the casino.

807
01:06:35,508 --> 01:06:39,173
我一人搞不定，所以我叫了你们，老朋友们
No way I could get to it on my own,
so I called on you, my old pals.

808
01:06:40,554 --> 01:06:43,045
三千万美元分六份依然是很大一笔钱
30 million split six ways
is still a lot of money.

809
01:06:45,851 --> 01:06:49,766
我们风险太大，队长，尤其是你
We're risking a lot, Captain.
You especially.

810
01:06:49,939 --> 01:06:52,512
所有人都知道你前途光明
Everybody knows you got a bright future.

811
01:06:52,692 --> 01:06:55,646
谁保证的？你的市长？
Promised by who? His Honour?

812
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:58,524
他跟你承诺什么了，沃夫？
What carrot
is he teasing you with, Wolf?

813
01:06:58,698 --> 01:07:01,070
若他知道你所掌握的，他还会放过你？
He's gonna let you out in the street
knowing what you know now?

814
01:07:01,242 --> 01:07:02,404
你什么意思？
What's that supposed to mean?

815
01:07:02,576 --> 01:07:05,447
意思是，他的第二任期快到头了，什么保证都是屁
His second term is gonna come to an end
and his hold on the city goes poof.

816
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:08,077
就跟普通公民一样
Just like that he's Joe Citizen again.

817
01:07:08,207 --> 01:07:10,496
三千万是一笔不错的退休金
30 million would be
a nice retirement package.

818
01:07:10,668 --> 01:07:11,913
他给中国佬什么好处？
What's he giving the Chinks?

819
01:07:12,086 --> 01:07:15,953
如果我知道，还会跟你们这帮混蛋站在这里？
If I knew that, I wouldn't be standing
here with you assholes, would I?

820
01:07:17,675 --> 01:07:19,252
光明未来，哈？
A bright future, huh?

821
01:07:19,427 --> 01:07:21,135
头条
Big headlines.

822
01:07:21,304 --> 01:07:24,755
“英雄警察破获纽约最大的地下赌博巢穴”
"Hero cops take down New York City's
biggest underground gambling operation."

823
01:07:24,932 --> 01:07:27,933
每人五百万美元，且没人知道
Five million bucks apiece
that no one will ever know about,

824
01:07:28,102 --> 01:07:30,391
就当是额外甜头
just to give it that extra sweet taste.

825
01:07:48,247 --> 01:07:52,197
好了，谁进去过？拜托，谁进去过？
All right, who's been in there?
For Christ's sake, who's been in there?

826
01:07:52,376 --> 01:07:54,701
- 我，队长
- 你俩做先锋
- Me, Cap.
- You two, you're on point.

827
01:07:54,879 --> 01:07:57,666
里面都是平民，看准了打
Place is packed with civilians,
so exercise some judgement.

828
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,963
记住只有我有密码
Remember, I got the combination.

829
01:08:00,134 --> 01:08:02,376
如果你们想要钱，掩护好我
You want that money, watch my back.

830
01:08:19,737 --> 01:08:21,813
你要去哪？
Where are you going?

831
01:08:21,989 --> 01:08:24,776
别动！待着！
Don't move! Stay!

832
01:08:38,673 --> 01:08:40,048
让开！走！
Out of the way! Move!

833
01:08:57,733 --> 01:08:59,192
嘿，你，去死吧！
Hey, you, settle down!

834
01:09:11,455 --> 01:09:12,653
这里！走！
This way. Let's go.

835
01:09:57,293 --> 01:09:58,573
小心
Heads up.

836
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:09,092
走
Go.

837
01:10:20,149 --> 01:10:22,272
科夫克斯，干掉他
Kolfax, take him out.

838
01:10:28,783 --> 01:10:30,491
掩护他
Cover him.

839
01:11:12,994 --> 01:11:14,820
打开它，开枪！
Open it. Take it!

840
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:17,956
靠！
Oh, shit!

841
01:11:37,768 --> 01:11:39,678
靠！我必须离开这里
Oh, shit.
I gotta get out of here.

842
01:11:39,854 --> 01:11:42,808
操，操，队长
Oh, fuck. Fuck, Captain.

843
01:11:45,276 --> 01:11:48,645
天啊，你个混蛋！你杀了同伴，你个混蛋！
God, you shit!
Shoot a man in the back, son of a bitch!

844
01:11:49,530 --> 01:11:52,650
- 好了，米尔斯，我们往哪走？
- 这里
- All right, Mears, where we going?
- This way.

845
01:11:53,534 --> 01:11:55,361
快
Move.

846
01:12:35,076 --> 01:12:37,649
- 天堂之门到了
- 把我们这样的罪人拒之门外
- The gates of paradise.
- Locked and bolted to sinners like us.

847
01:12:37,828 --> 01:12:40,746
好了，别浪费时间
Yeah, well,
let's not wait for an invitation.

848
01:13:03,688 --> 01:13:06,226
好了，你个混蛋，快点开始
All right, you bastard. Get started.

849
01:13:14,782 --> 01:13:16,905
下面按我说的做
Here's how we do this.

850
01:13:17,076 --> 01:13:20,112
你们先放下枪，我再开保险箱
You put down your guns, I open the safe.

851
01:13:21,455 --> 01:13:23,744
如果你们想杀我，随意
If you wanna shoot me, go ahead.

852
01:13:23,916 --> 01:13:27,166
快点决定，真警察马上就要到了
Make your minds up quick
'cause the real cops'll be here soon.

853
01:13:30,006 --> 01:13:31,915
放到地上
On the floor.

854
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,576
快点，你个混蛋，你想干什么？
Come on, you son of a bitch.
What are you trying to pull?

855
01:14:08,753 --> 01:14:11,504
密码左右方向反了，马上就开了
I had right left switched.
It's gonna open.

856
01:14:29,190 --> 01:14:30,352
你会活着的
You'll live.

857
01:14:33,194 --> 01:14:35,186
左26
Left 26.

858
01:14:51,587 --> 01:14:53,378
沃夫队长，这里发生了什么？
Captain Wolf,
what the hell happened in here?

859
01:14:53,547 --> 01:14:56,299
你以为发生了什么，哈？我们突袭了这里
What do you think happened, huh?
We had a raid on the place go bad.

860
01:14:56,467 --> 01:14:58,625
有人员伤亡，赶紧给我进去处理
We got dead cops, casualties.
Get in there, will you?

861
01:14:58,803 --> 01:15:01,424
- 沃夫队长，你需要救护车
- 我需要一排救护车
- Captain Wolf, you need an ambulance.
- I need a fleet of ambulances.

862
01:15:01,597 --> 01:15:04,468
赶紧叫救护车，懂吗？我自己开去医院
Call it in, will you? I'll take
my own busted ass to the hospital.

863
01:15:07,603 --> 01:15:09,097
演技不错
Not bad.

864
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:12,059
如果你不是个两面派，我几乎都喜欢上你了
If you werert such a double-dealing
asshole, I could almost like you.

865
01:15:12,233 --> 01:15:14,688
是几乎！开车！
Almost. Drive.

866
01:15:19,865 --> 01:15:21,490
只是划伤
It's a scratch.

867
01:15:24,787 --> 01:15:28,571
我不会杀你，但我可没说让你住大酒店
I'm not gonna kill you, but I didn't say
I was putting you up at the Ritz.

868
01:15:36,924 --> 01:15:38,418
沃夫
Wolf.

869
01:15:38,592 --> 01:15:40,585
我需要钱，丹尼
<i>I have your money, Danny.</i>

870
01:15:42,346 --> 01:15:43,342
什么？
What?

871
01:15:45,057 --> 01:15:46,717
你听见了
You heard me.

872
01:15:46,892 --> 01:15:50,261
三千万！五千份一千美元的支票
30 million. Five-thousand
and one-thousand dollar bills.

873
01:15:50,438 --> 01:15:52,181
- 我想谈谈
- 不行
<i>- I wanna talk.
- No.</i>

874
01:15:52,356 --> 01:15:54,764
你需要的是冷静下来我们好谈点正常的
No, what you wanna do is calm down
so we can talk like adults.

875
01:15:54,942 --> 01:15:56,602
闭嘴，丹尼
<i>Shut it, Danny.</i>

876
01:15:56,736 --> 01:15:58,859
我是想谈，不过不是和你谈
<i>I wanna talk,
but I don't wanna talk to you.</i>

877
01:15:59,030 --> 01:16:00,488
我要和你男朋友谈
<i>I wanna talk to your boyfriend.</i>

878
01:16:04,910 --> 01:16:06,618
我是亚历克斯
This is Alex.

879
01:16:06,746 --> 01:16:09,201
好久不见，亚历克斯
<i>Been a while, Alex.</i>

880
01:16:09,373 --> 01:16:11,781
- 你怎么拿到这号码的？
- 别这样，亚历克斯
- How'd you get this number?
- Come on, Alex.

881
01:16:11,959 --> 01:16:14,082
顺着市长的味就能找到你
Reach up the mayor's ass, there you are.

882
01:16:16,297 --> 01:16:18,704
男人就该有男人样，哈？
A mars gotta do
what a mars gotta do, huh?

883
01:16:18,883 --> 01:16:20,959
他总比安妮这诱饵好
He's a better catch
than Annie was anyway.

884
01:16:21,135 --> 01:16:24,469
我一直不解你为什么会勾搭上那样一头奶牛
<i>I never understood
how you hooked up with a cow like that.</i>

885
01:16:24,639 --> 01:16:27,308
绝不是因为她的长相，而是她的幽默感
It was never about her looks.
It was her sense of humour.

886
01:16:27,475 --> 01:16:29,681
她现在没那么搞笑了，不是么？
She's not so funny now, is she?

887
01:16:29,852 --> 01:16:32,343
不是了，我也一样
No, she's not. Neither am I.

888
01:16:34,273 --> 01:16:37,060
我拿到了钱，亚历克斯，我杀了很多人才弄到的
I have the money, Alex.
I had to kill a lot of people to get it.

889
01:16:37,234 --> 01:16:38,645
所以听着
<i>So listen up.</i>

890
01:16:40,029 --> 01:16:43,279
你还没交换过密码，另一个保险箱里是什么？
You haven't made the combination
exchange yet. What's in the other safe?

891
01:16:43,449 --> 01:16:45,940
一张碟片
A disc.

892
01:16:46,118 --> 01:16:48,692
名字，钱的来龙去脉…
Names, money trails.

893
01:16:48,871 --> 01:16:51,872
当指挥官派我们帮丹尼清理城市时
<i>When our commanders sent the two of us
to help Danny clean up the city,</i>

894
01:16:52,041 --> 01:16:53,072
他们附加了一个条件
<i>they attached a price.</i>

895
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:54,793
作为交换，丹尼要自寻财路
In exchange, Danny looked the other way

896
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:57,914
而每笔被当做恐怖组织查抄的集团资金
while the assets seized from every group
deemed a terrorist organisation

897
01:16:58,089 --> 01:16:59,962
则装进了他们的私人腰包
were funnelled
into their private accounts.

898
01:17:00,132 --> 01:17:01,710
惊讶是他们受惊需要保护时
<i>Amazing what people
let you get away with</i>

899
01:17:01,884 --> 01:17:03,793
却把你赶走了
<i>when they're scared
and wanna feel protected.</i>

900
01:17:03,970 --> 01:17:05,796
惊讶的是有那么多小人
Amazing how many scumbags
there are out there

901
01:17:05,972 --> 01:17:07,549
都等着乘机牟利
waiting to take advantage of it.

902
01:17:07,723 --> 01:17:09,348
- 难道你没有么？
- 我退出了
<i>- Like you didn't?
- I quit.</i>

903
01:17:09,517 --> 01:17:12,518
你以为这能帮那些被你私自送去见上帝的人
Bet that helps all those souls you sent
to meet their maker without due process

904
01:17:12,687 --> 01:17:13,849
省下很多功夫吗？
rest a whole lot easier.

905
01:17:14,021 --> 01:17:15,978
你以为你在拳击场上
<i>You thought you could atone
by climbing into a cage</i>

906
01:17:16,148 --> 01:17:18,224
被人随意殴打就能赎罪吗？
<i>and allowing yourself
to get beaten to a pulp?</i>

907
01:17:18,401 --> 01:17:20,144
别给我说教了，路克！
<i>Don't fucking preach at me, Luke.</i>

908
01:17:20,319 --> 01:17:23,071
我只是收钱办事
I'm getting paid for services rendered.

909
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:27,699
是啊，你把碟片卖给中国人好让他们勒索我们上司
<i>Right. You sell the disc to the Chinese
so they can blackmail our old honchos,</i>

910
01:17:27,868 --> 01:17:31,569
然后拿着三千万美元和丹尼去巴哈马别墅逍遥自在
<i>take the 30 mill and waltz off
with Danny to a villa in the Bahamas.</i>

911
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:34,285
是巴厘岛，不过无所谓了，不是么？
Bali, but whatever, right?

912
01:17:34,458 --> 01:17:37,495
那么，就算你知道了，又如何？
So, now you know. Now what?

913
01:17:37,712 --> 01:17:39,503
现在你要应付我
<i>Now you're dealing with me.</i>

914
01:17:39,714 --> 01:17:42,252
- 好吧，我退出
- 不行
<i>- All right, I'm turning around.
- No, you're not.</i>

915
01:17:43,467 --> 01:17:46,089
你说什么？你已经拿到钱了
What are you talking about?
You've got the money.

916
01:17:46,262 --> 01:17:50,556
- 中国人手里没有我要的了
- 不，他们有我想要的
<i>- The Chinese have nothing I care about.
- No. They have something I do.</i>

917
01:18:09,076 --> 01:18:12,741
把你保险箱密码给这女孩，她会给你我们的
Give the girl the combination to your
safe and she will give you our number.

918
01:18:12,913 --> 01:18:14,740
我们到你的地方，你去我们的
We go to your location, you go to ours.

919
01:18:14,874 --> 01:18:18,207
当我们拿到碟片，我们会给你解密密码
When we've gotten the disc,
we will explain the code

920
01:18:18,377 --> 01:18:19,575
你拿到你的钱
and you'll get the cash.

921
01:18:20,379 --> 01:18:22,372
一言为定
That's the deal.

922
01:18:23,132 --> 01:18:26,252
- 说说看吧
- 这是个很长的数字
- Let's hear it.
- It's a very long number.

923
01:18:26,427 --> 01:18:28,918
你最好能记下来
You'll want to write it down.

924
01:18:29,096 --> 01:18:31,053
感谢上帝我还带了笔，哈？
Thank goodness I brought a pen, huh?

925
01:18:40,983 --> 01:18:42,643
你最好闭上眼睛
You might wanna close your eyes.

926
01:18:44,904 --> 01:18:46,363
随你便吧
Have it your way.

927
01:18:58,793 --> 01:19:00,785
快接，路克
Come on, Luke.

928
01:19:03,005 --> 01:19:05,413
老地方，就你和我
<i>The old place, just you and me.</i>

929
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:09,671
你是路克的朋友吗？
You're a friend of Luke?

930
01:19:12,306 --> 01:19:14,382
这不是你该关心的
Not as far as you're concerned.

931
01:19:26,529 --> 01:19:28,687
今晚席卷整个纽约的暴力活动
<i>The violence
that has rocked the city tonight</i>

932
01:19:28,864 --> 01:19:30,240
依旧持续，不到一小时前
<i>continued in a bloody gun battle</i>

933
01:19:30,408 --> 01:19:33,362
中国城一家夜总会爆发了血腥枪战
<i>in a Chinatown nightclub
less than an hourago.</i>

934
01:19:33,536 --> 01:19:35,824
- 这已经完全失控了
- 你以为呢？
- This is really getting out of hand.
- You think?

935
01:19:35,955 --> 01:19:37,994
谢谢提醒
Thanks for that insight.

936
01:19:38,165 --> 01:19:41,000
市长，亚历克斯・罗瑟斯在你私人专线上
Your Honour,
Alex Rosers on your private line.

937
01:19:41,168 --> 01:19:42,663
他说有急事
He says that it's urgent.

938
01:19:42,837 --> 01:19:46,170
- 打扰一下，市长
- 我5分钟后回来，现在别烦我
- Excuse me, Your Honour.
- Back in five. Don't bother me now.

939
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:48,547
他为什么不打我手机？
Why didn't he call me on my cellphone?

940
01:19:48,718 --> 01:19:51,635
我记得让你把所有电话都接到我的…
I thought I told you to put
all my calls through to the...

941
01:19:52,596 --> 01:19:55,716
我一直跟你说这里保安水平太差
I always told you this place
had lousy security standards.

942
01:19:57,977 --> 01:20:01,144
那是因为没人会疯到像你一样来这杀人
Because nobody's been crazy enough to
come in here and pull a stunt like this.

943
01:20:01,314 --> 01:20:05,098
- 你有种，路克
- 是啊，真是惊讶我还能走路
- You got some balls, Luke.
- Yeah, amazing I can even walk.

944
01:20:05,276 --> 01:20:06,853
给我碟片
The disc.

945
01:20:06,986 --> 01:20:09,311
什么？你以为我会傻到让中国帮派
What, you think I'm stupid enough
to let a gang of Chinese

946
01:20:09,488 --> 01:20:11,896
穿过前门进到房间来拿它？
walk up the front steps and collect it
from me in my living room?

947
01:20:12,074 --> 01:20:15,739
- 它在离这很远的保险箱里
- 我不认为你很蠢
- It's in a safe far away from here.
- I don't think you're stupid.

948
01:20:15,911 --> 01:20:18,996
所以我不认为你只有一份拷贝
Which is why I don't for a second
believe you gave away the only copy.

949
01:20:19,165 --> 01:20:21,371
我会去见亚历克斯
I'm going to meet Alex.

950
01:20:21,542 --> 01:20:24,993
你先给我碟片，不然我就在非要害的部位给你一枪
First you give me the disc or I'll put
bullets in places that won't kill you

951
01:20:25,171 --> 01:20:28,504
让你下半辈子生不如死
but make you spend
the rest of your life wishing I had.

952
01:20:36,641 --> 01:20:38,218
满意了?
Satisfied?

953
01:20:38,392 --> 01:20:40,764
我要确认一下这不是“金刚葫芦娃”
<i>I wanna make sure
it's not ABBA'sGreatest Hits.</i>

954
01:20:50,738 --> 01:20:52,481
亚历克斯会杀了你的,你知道的
Alex will kill you, you know.

955
01:20:53,783 --> 01:20:56,108
嗯，或许吧
Yeah, probably.

956
01:21:40,997 --> 01:21:44,282
上帝，路克，你气色很不好
Jesus. Luke, you look like hell.

957
01:21:45,209 --> 01:21:49,871
酒精而已，缺少睡眠和阳光
Just alcohol, lack of sunlight,
sleep deprivation.

958
01:21:51,465 --> 01:21:53,458
除此以外，我感觉不错
Other than that, I feel great.

959
01:21:55,553 --> 01:21:59,847
呵，我在想，我们在这里抛过多少尸了？
You know, I was thinking, how many
bodies have we dumped in this place?

960
01:22:02,059 --> 01:22:03,435
你知道的，我从不记数
You know, I didn't keep count.

961
01:22:04,729 --> 01:22:06,970
他们都是混蛋，不是么？
They were all assholes, though, right?

962
01:22:11,777 --> 01:22:12,809
放开她，亚历克斯
Let her go, Alex.

963
01:22:14,405 --> 01:22:17,572
丹尼打电话说你去拜访过他
Danny called.
He told me about your visit.

964
01:22:19,076 --> 01:22:22,196
我不得不承认，我都没想到这一手
I have to admit,
even I didn't see that one coming.

965
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:26,075
你现在有了钱和碟片
You had the disc and the money.

966
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:28,658
什么...
What...

967
01:22:28,836 --> 01:22:31,588
她对你来说意味着什么？
What is she to you?

968
01:22:34,216 --> 01:22:35,212
生命
Life.

969
01:22:37,136 --> 01:22:40,552
好吧，趁还有命就好好享受吧
Well, enjoy it while it lasts,

970
01:22:40,723 --> 01:22:43,392
不久她就会让你的小命玩完的
'cause she's the reason
yours is gonna be a whole lot shorter.

971
01:22:44,477 --> 01:22:46,469
钱在哪，路克
The money, Luke.

972
01:22:47,688 --> 01:22:49,681
在车里
In the car.

973
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:54,104
或者银行里
Or in the bank.

974
01:22:57,156 --> 01:22:59,729
或者在中央车站储物柜里
Or in a series of lockers
at Grand Central.

975
01:22:59,909 --> 01:23:04,037
或者我可能出于好心悉数捐出了
Or maybe I donated it to charity,
out of the goodness of my heart.

976
01:23:06,123 --> 01:23:09,208
想要知道下落，你就得来硬的
You wanna find out where that money is,
you're gonna have to do it the hard way.

977
01:24:06,142 --> 01:24:08,549
你还好吧，梅？
You all right, Mei?

978
01:24:08,728 --> 01:24:12,179
我见过他打斗，你打不过他的
I saw him fight before.
Bad business for you.

979
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:15,147
是啊，最糟的是
Yeah. The worst.

980
01:24:17,361 --> 01:24:20,148
你又救了我
You saved me, again.

981
01:24:21,574 --> 01:24:23,151
我们救了对方
We save each other.

982
01:24:27,997 --> 01:24:29,705
我知道你在想什么
I know how you feel.

983
01:24:30,875 --> 01:24:33,117
帮我把这垃圾弄出来
Help me get this sack of garbage
out of the car.

984
01:24:35,504 --> 01:24:37,830
确保他安全回到他老爸那儿
Make sure he gets to his daddy
safe and sound.

985
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:44,510
5万，赔偿你的损失
50 grand, for your trouble.

986
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:47,551
钱可能不多，但至少你有命花
Might not seem like much, but at least
you're gonna live to enjoy it.

987
01:24:47,725 --> 01:24:51,473
在经历了这么多后，你还想放过他？
You want him safe and sound
after what he did to you?

988
01:24:53,856 --> 01:24:55,683
为了她
For her sake.

989
01:24:59,487 --> 01:25:01,479
若再见面，你就万事皆休
We meet again, all bets are off.

990
01:25:49,662 --> 01:25:51,951
- 你妈的给我看路，哥们！
- 走你的
- Watch where you're fucking going, man!
- Keep walking.

991
01:25:52,123 --> 01:25:54,364
- 什么？再说一遍？啥？
- 走开
- Excuse me? Pardon me? Anything?
- Walk.

992
01:25:54,542 --> 01:25:56,534
这是他妈的纽约！
This is fucking New York City!

993
01:26:08,097 --> 01:26:10,932
- 第五家银行了，还有几家？
- 没了
- Bank number five. How many more?
- That's it.

994
01:26:12,143 --> 01:26:15,060
现在碟片拷贝已遍布城市保险柜
Got copies of the disc
in security boxes all over the city.

995
01:26:15,229 --> 01:26:16,474
如果我们出事
Anything happens to us,

996
01:26:16,647 --> 01:26:18,806
很多大人物就得倒霉
a lot of important people
are gonna be very sorry.

997
01:26:18,983 --> 01:26:21,853
我们的护身符，这是笔好生意
Our security. Good business for us.

998
01:26:24,238 --> 01:26:27,156
- 现在干嘛？
- 我们离开这里
- What now?
- Now we get out of town.

999
01:26:29,368 --> 01:26:34,659
梅，你是个孩子…我不确定自己能否做个好父亲
Mei, you're a kid and...
I'm not sure I could be a good father.

1000
01:26:34,832 --> 01:26:36,575
我想我能力不足
I think that ship has sailed.

1001
01:26:36,751 --> 01:26:38,660
我不想要父亲
I don't want no more fathers.

1002
01:26:41,130 --> 01:26:43,336
你可以做我朋友吗？
Will you be my friend?

1003
01:26:44,717 --> 01:26:46,710
至死都愿
Till my dying day.

1004
01:26:51,265 --> 01:26:54,681
我找到一家在西雅图专门培训天才儿童的学校
I got info on a school
for gifted kids up in Seattle.

1005
01:26:56,312 --> 01:26:59,895
这会是次美妙旅行，如果你喜欢那里的风光的话
It's a nice drive,
if you like trees and shit.

1006
01:27:02,193 --> 01:27:03,189
我们安全了吗？
Are we safe?

1007
01:27:05,488 --> 01:27:08,987
别想太多，梅，别想太多
One day at a time, Mei.
One day at a time.
