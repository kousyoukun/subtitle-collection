1
00:03:19,186 --> 00:03:22,155
Well, we definitely got him.

2
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:26,350
It's a gut shot, but we got him pretty good.

3
00:03:26,426 --> 00:03:28,656
He didn't even take his rifle.

4
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:30,697
His horse run off, though.

5
00:03:30,764 --> 00:03:32,959
Cleared up some.
We ought to get a move on.

6
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:34,864
Let him bleed.

7
00:03:35,535 --> 00:03:38,936
If he keeps going down,
he's going to get some distance on us.

8
00:03:43,043 --> 00:03:44,635
He ain't going nowhere.

9
00:03:48,348 --> 00:03:49,781
We let him bleed.

10
00:08:30,196 --> 00:08:32,994
Well, let's just get paid up
and be done with it.

11
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,591
- He went in.
- Yep.

12
00:08:37,871 --> 00:08:41,830
There's no tracks on the other side.
He done gone over them falls.

13
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:44,076
Ain't no body.

14
00:08:44,444 --> 00:08:46,435
Well, he went in that there water...

15
00:08:47,213 --> 00:08:49,909
There ain't no body.
There ain't gonna be no body.

16
00:08:49,983 --> 00:08:53,282
- There's always a body.
- You expect us just to conjure him?

17
00:08:54,521 --> 00:08:57,922
I expect you to find him.
That's what I'm paying you for.

18
00:10:28,915 --> 00:10:30,542
Stay, stay.

19
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,717
Stay.

20
00:12:39,512 --> 00:12:41,241
Oh, God.

21
00:13:16,115 --> 00:13:18,675
Oh, God. Oh, God.

22
00:13:35,535 --> 00:13:37,230
Y'all smell that?

23
00:14:41,634 --> 00:14:43,158
Oh, fuck.

24
00:16:14,894 --> 00:16:16,259
Don't touch it.

25
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:34,403
He's doubled back on his tracks.
Hayes, you and the kid follow those two.

26
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,414
Pope, you take that one.

27
00:16:36,516 --> 00:16:38,746
Mr. Parsons, you wait here.

28
00:16:38,885 --> 00:16:41,649
I'll take this one. He's not far.

29
00:16:41,788 --> 00:16:44,188
So watch yourselves. I got his gun.

30
00:16:44,357 --> 00:16:46,291
He ain't bleeding no more.

31
00:16:48,761 --> 00:16:50,092
Yes, he is.

32
00:20:29,548 --> 00:20:31,038
Where's Pope?

33
00:20:32,918 --> 00:20:36,183
The intervals are 10 feet.
Be ready. He's here.

34
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:40,316
Remember, if you kill this son of a bitch,
you will not be paid.

35
00:20:41,093 --> 00:20:42,754
Extremities only.

36
00:21:20,766 --> 00:21:22,927
God damn it. Oh, hell.

37
00:21:26,072 --> 00:21:27,664
Lord almighty.

38
00:21:29,141 --> 00:21:30,768
What did he do to Pope?

39
00:21:32,345 --> 00:21:35,610
Mister, who the hell is this man?

40
00:21:35,715 --> 00:21:37,842
Get the horses. We have him now.

41
00:21:40,152 --> 00:21:43,417
He must be part Indian or wolf.

42
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:47,748
- Eat a man like that.
- He didn't eat him. Go.

43
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,699
Go.

44
00:23:17,116 --> 00:23:19,846
Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing?

45
00:23:33,365 --> 00:23:34,992
I guess it makes sense.

46
00:23:38,471 --> 00:23:41,770
- Finished off by a young'un.
- I ain't no young'un.

47
00:23:41,974 --> 00:23:45,102
And I don't care to hear you say
another goddamn thing.

48
00:23:45,744 --> 00:23:49,305
Now, come on out of there
and put your hands out in front of you.

49
00:23:56,655 --> 00:23:57,815
Come on.

50
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,891
You been shot.

51
00:24:09,168 --> 00:24:11,898
Trying to steal somebody else's horse,
I reckon.

52
00:24:12,404 --> 00:24:15,032
I'd say you need a new line of work, mister.

53
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,147
Nathaniel!

54
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:31,920
Nathaniel! Come on.

55
00:24:38,163 --> 00:24:39,596
Come on, now.

56
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,848
Thank you, thank you. Thank you.

57
00:25:08,027 --> 00:25:10,086
- Who is he?
- Horse thief.

58
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:13,095
But he's hurt.

59
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:15,791
I'll pay for the horse.

60
00:25:16,335 --> 00:25:17,927
You best rest yourself.

61
00:25:18,904 --> 00:25:22,305
Pa'll be home after a while,
and he'll decide what to do with you.

62
00:25:34,853 --> 00:25:36,582
No more tracks, Carver.

63
00:25:37,623 --> 00:25:39,523
The trail's gone cold up there.

64
00:26:17,796 --> 00:26:19,286
Your sister...

65
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:24,431
She don't take kindly to thieving.

66
00:26:28,741 --> 00:26:31,904
There's plenty of time for that
when you grow up.

67
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:38,948
See that.

68
00:26:43,522 --> 00:26:45,251
Yeah, he's still bleeding.

69
00:26:45,324 --> 00:26:47,485
There's something else down here.

70
00:26:49,028 --> 00:26:51,553
- Take a look.
- Yeah.

71
00:26:56,168 --> 00:26:57,362
What'd you see?

72
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:05,036
Charlotte.

73
00:27:11,116 --> 00:27:13,175
We caught him trying to steal Red.

74
00:27:13,252 --> 00:27:15,482
He's hurt. Shot.

75
00:27:17,222 --> 00:27:18,712
Who are you, mister?

76
00:27:19,892 --> 00:27:23,988
I do some trapping a bit north of here.

77
00:27:24,363 --> 00:27:26,923
Must be quite a bit north of here.

78
00:27:29,401 --> 00:27:30,561
Quite a bit.

79
00:27:32,604 --> 00:27:36,131
I don't expect you shot yourself.

80
00:27:37,376 --> 00:27:39,344
No. No.

81
00:27:40,412 --> 00:27:42,642
Somebody after your hides?

82
00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:46,140
Fringing on your territory?

83
00:27:47,453 --> 00:27:48,852
I couldn't say.

84
00:27:50,089 --> 00:27:54,788
You come down out of that pass
without a horse?

85
00:27:55,427 --> 00:28:00,490
Up here, a man without a horse
is generally a dead man.

86
00:28:02,735 --> 00:28:04,100
That I can solve.

87
00:28:04,403 --> 00:28:08,203
So I don't take kindly to a man
trying to steal mine.

88
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:12,333
Like I told your girl, I'll pay for the horse.

89
00:28:16,849 --> 00:28:20,876
It's only about six days' walk
from here to town,

90
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,010
as I recall.

91
00:28:24,022 --> 00:28:27,788
I'll pay you twice what you paid for her.

92
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,757
If you can pay,

93
00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:34,057
why don't you just walk yourself
down there?

94
00:29:02,294 --> 00:29:03,693
I'd rather not.

95
00:29:12,738 --> 00:29:15,468
- Nothing there.
- Not a goddamn thing.

96
00:29:17,075 --> 00:29:19,475
- I'll go down there and take a look.
- No.

97
00:29:19,878 --> 00:29:22,574
We're done here. We'll follow the ridge.

98
00:29:23,115 --> 00:29:27,017
That's 16 days. Seventeen out Mount Olive,

99
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,480
- at $1 a day.
- You'll get your money when we find him.

100
00:29:30,556 --> 00:29:31,989
Not before.

101
00:29:32,491 --> 00:29:34,891
What do you mean? You saw.

102
00:29:35,861 --> 00:29:38,022
That trail ends down
at the end of that ravine.

103
00:29:38,096 --> 00:29:40,360
'Cause he never went down the ravine.

104
00:29:40,666 --> 00:29:42,156
We follow the ridge.

105
00:30:18,871 --> 00:30:20,065
Come here.

106
00:30:32,317 --> 00:30:33,614
I'm Gideon.

107
00:30:47,766 --> 00:30:49,859
You don't talk much, do you, boy?

108
00:30:52,037 --> 00:30:55,370
You know, it's not considered polite

109
00:30:58,176 --> 00:31:01,873
to shoot a man
who's sleeping in your house.

110
00:31:35,781 --> 00:31:36,907
Well,

111
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:40,175
get on back to bed.

112
00:32:41,546 --> 00:32:43,013
Where is he?

113
00:32:43,515 --> 00:32:46,177
- Who the hell...
- I'm doing the asking here.

114
00:32:46,251 --> 00:32:48,719
- Coffee and biscuits, woman.
- Now, lie to me

115
00:32:49,354 --> 00:32:52,323
and I will fire this place with you
and yourn in it.

116
00:32:52,391 --> 00:32:55,189
- Now where is he?
- Must have left at first light.

117
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,058
We done got here at first light. Damn fool.

118
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:01,122
- Were he able-bodied when he come here?
- No.

119
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:04,695
- Did you give him supplies or a rifle?
- No.

120
00:33:04,936 --> 00:33:08,167
- He had a pistol.
- Took that off of Pope after he killed him.

121
00:33:09,441 --> 00:33:11,375
- You give him a horse?
- No.

122
00:33:12,677 --> 00:33:14,508
Ain't no horse for that one.

123
00:33:15,047 --> 00:33:17,880
Mister, I don't know where you come from,

124
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:21,052
but we helped a shot mongrel of a man,
and he's gone away in the night,

125
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:22,746
and that's all we know.

126
00:33:28,627 --> 00:33:30,356
You lying son of a bitch.

127
00:33:32,097 --> 00:33:35,396
What did you sell him?
What did the devil get for his money?

128
00:33:45,177 --> 00:33:46,166
Hayes.

129
00:33:47,446 --> 00:33:49,971
I ain't paying you to play with womenfolk.

130
00:34:21,213 --> 00:34:23,408
Tell me about the man who came here.

131
00:34:26,785 --> 00:34:28,480
If I think you're lying,

132
00:34:29,554 --> 00:34:32,580
I'll kill your brother
and hand you over to Mr. Hayes.

133
00:34:35,694 --> 00:34:37,093
He was here,

134
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,759
and he left in the night.

135
00:34:41,967 --> 00:34:45,368
- Stole a mare, looks like.
- What about that gold?

136
00:34:46,304 --> 00:34:47,532
I don't know.

137
00:34:48,607 --> 00:34:50,097
I don't know.

138
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,274
I took it.

139
00:34:57,716 --> 00:35:00,207
He was sleeping. I took it from his bag.

140
00:35:02,687 --> 00:35:04,245
I only wanted a gun

141
00:35:05,323 --> 00:35:06,722
to protect us.

142
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,958
Son, nobody can protect nobody
in this world.

143
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:23,439
The sooner you realize that, the better.

144
00:35:49,401 --> 00:35:51,528
Pope's horse stays.

145
00:36:48,326 --> 00:36:50,089
You son of a bitch.

146
00:36:52,264 --> 00:36:54,164
No wonder you don't talk much.

147
00:36:55,533 --> 00:36:57,000
Too busy thieving.

148
00:40:31,583 --> 00:40:33,278
How do you write "wife"?

149
00:40:33,952 --> 00:40:36,716
Kid, that's W...

150
00:40:37,889 --> 00:40:41,222
H-O-R-E.

151
00:40:42,627 --> 00:40:44,788
Don't much matter how you spell it,

152
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:49,623
a woman ain't gonna be yours
unless you're paying her for the night.

153
00:40:50,301 --> 00:40:53,293
You pay her to be sweet to you, kid,
that's all.

154
00:40:53,404 --> 00:40:55,929
Don't never mix up money and love.

155
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:14,982
Toss the pistol.

156
00:41:28,106 --> 00:41:29,801
What do you want?

157
00:41:30,675 --> 00:41:34,736
I'd have thought that it was obvious,
seeing as how I've been shooting at you.

158
00:41:37,482 --> 00:41:39,279
Keep them hands out.

159
00:41:43,288 --> 00:41:44,619
Turn around.

160
00:41:51,396 --> 00:41:53,023
Why are you doing this?

161
00:41:56,968 --> 00:41:58,731
Seraphim Falls.

162
00:42:08,346 --> 00:42:11,679
Colonel Carver.

163
00:42:14,052 --> 00:42:17,647
Turn around. I wanna see your face.

164
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:44,578
- What?
- Double watches the rest of the night.

165
00:44:03,828 --> 00:44:06,763
You'll be on him before long.
He was here today.

166
00:44:07,198 --> 00:44:10,690
Watch the sides.
Make sure he didn't break off and cover.

167
00:45:09,393 --> 00:45:10,985
Jesus Christ.

168
00:45:15,133 --> 00:45:18,694
He's still breathing.
We got to get this thing off him.

169
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:31,814
Parsons, see about that horse.

170
00:46:09,487 --> 00:46:13,753
Well, now we got some discussing to do.
Right here and now.

171
00:46:13,858 --> 00:46:17,123
We ain't negotiating based on
tracking no killer like this.

172
00:46:17,495 --> 00:46:19,122
You're being well-paid.

173
00:46:20,765 --> 00:46:23,666
We're 18 days on a 30-day commission,

174
00:46:23,768 --> 00:46:27,169
- and two of us is already dead.
- Can't say I'm surprised.

175
00:46:27,572 --> 00:46:30,564
The man we're after
preys on the weak and unprepared.

176
00:46:31,342 --> 00:46:33,674
I'd advise you to take this as a warning.

177
00:46:33,744 --> 00:46:37,339
Well, what if we just decided
to take that as our walking papers?

178
00:46:41,018 --> 00:46:44,112
You are, of course,
free to do that, Mr. Hayes.

179
00:46:44,188 --> 00:46:48,454
You will, however, do it without
the assistance of my horse on which you sit.

180
00:46:48,993 --> 00:46:50,790
Am I clear, gentlemen?

181
00:46:51,629 --> 00:46:52,857
We'll keep on.

182
00:46:53,231 --> 00:46:56,689
But we want to split the pay
that's due them, instead.

183
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:02,068
Done. Now we've got distance to cover.

184
00:47:02,139 --> 00:47:05,734
If our man makes it to the low country,
we'll likely never see him again.

185
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:08,278
Wouldn't catch me complaining about that.

186
00:48:37,702 --> 00:48:39,101
Morning, stranger.

187
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,399
I didn't figure any transients this far up.

188
00:48:46,043 --> 00:48:48,034
I'm just passing through, is all.

189
00:48:48,512 --> 00:48:49,877
You need some whiskey?
We got some whiskey.

190
00:48:49,947 --> 00:48:51,278
Shut up, Horace.

191
00:48:51,949 --> 00:48:54,281
No, I can't say as I'm looking for whiskey,

192
00:48:55,319 --> 00:48:57,617
but I sure could use some food.

193
00:49:03,327 --> 00:49:06,228
Looks like you boys
have got other things on your mind.

194
00:49:07,665 --> 00:49:10,463
Would have been helpful
if you hadn't seen those.

195
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:17,470
Well, if you ain't planning on eating,
I'll just be getting on.

196
00:49:17,975 --> 00:49:20,136
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.

197
00:49:21,379 --> 00:49:23,904
You see, we is fugitives from the law.

198
00:49:24,348 --> 00:49:27,408
They catch us, they're gonna string us up.

199
00:49:27,485 --> 00:49:29,612
Horace, if you don't get quiet,
I'm gonna hang you myself.

200
00:49:29,687 --> 00:49:31,621
It don't much matter to me.

201
00:49:32,757 --> 00:49:36,887
I'm just looking to be left alone.
Same as you.

202
00:49:40,031 --> 00:49:41,896
So, I'll be on my way.

203
00:49:45,202 --> 00:49:47,500
You look powerful familiar, mister.

204
00:49:49,473 --> 00:49:50,804
I know you?

205
00:49:55,346 --> 00:49:56,745
I doubt it.

206
00:50:04,655 --> 00:50:06,020
I'll be damned.

207
00:50:06,524 --> 00:50:08,822
That's one of McClellan's boys
up at Antietam.

208
00:50:08,893 --> 00:50:10,554
Ain't you gonna kill him, huh?

209
00:50:11,162 --> 00:50:12,561
Waste of a bullet.

210
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:16,229
He's so banged up and hungry,
he won't make it to town anyway.

211
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,131
Lost both his sons

212
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:21,832
in one day at that goddamn bridge.

213
00:50:22,506 --> 00:50:24,565
- I seen it myself.
- Yeah?

214
00:50:24,942 --> 00:50:26,637
But nothing touched him.

215
00:50:28,145 --> 00:50:29,612
Not a scratch.

216
00:50:30,214 --> 00:50:31,806
Not a splinter.

217
00:50:33,484 --> 00:50:35,816
They say he killed over 100 men
that day alone.

218
00:50:35,886 --> 00:50:37,877
Him? Nah.

219
00:50:38,322 --> 00:50:41,450
Hey, you use some of that money
to get yourself some spectacles.

220
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,991
Still, Virgil, the way you shot that teller,
I thought you'd be itching to do it again.

221
00:50:46,097 --> 00:50:48,861
I'm itching to get out of here. Get going.

222
00:50:48,933 --> 00:50:50,798
Goddamn right. Let's go.

223
00:50:51,969 --> 00:50:53,459
Don't ever go chasing after that man.

224
00:50:53,537 --> 00:50:56,062
If you don't shoot him,
I swear to Christ I will.

225
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,370
We can't be letting no stranger,
whoever the hell you think he is,

226
00:50:58,442 --> 00:51:00,808
just walk into town
and tell them authorities where we gone.

227
00:51:00,878 --> 00:51:03,438
- Let's go. Come on.
- Take care of it myself.

228
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:07,210
Horace!

229
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:09,843
Horace, come on!

230
00:51:15,392 --> 00:51:18,088
Afraid I'm gonna have to ask you
to stop walking.

231
00:51:21,999 --> 00:51:23,728
Let me be, boy.

232
00:51:25,669 --> 00:51:28,103
Best just go on back up to your kin.

233
00:51:28,272 --> 00:51:30,968
Mister, I never shot nobody
in the back before.

234
00:51:31,308 --> 00:51:33,640
So it's best you just turn around,

235
00:51:34,178 --> 00:51:37,011
- and you get what's coming to you.
- Boy,

236
00:51:38,249 --> 00:51:40,979
now you put that gun up and go on.

237
00:51:41,952 --> 00:51:43,317
Turn around.

238
00:52:12,583 --> 00:52:14,210
You're a fool, boy.

239
00:52:16,921 --> 00:52:19,082
I told you to let me pass on.

240
00:52:38,275 --> 00:52:39,264
Hey!

241
00:52:44,982 --> 00:52:47,007
There was three of 'em.

242
00:52:47,151 --> 00:52:49,984
Two of 'em went on up,
one went down that way.

243
00:53:16,046 --> 00:53:19,174
- Look familiar, gentlemen?
- Figure it's him that done it?

244
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:20,239
'Course it's him.

245
00:53:20,317 --> 00:53:23,718
Who else would be dropping folks
like owl pellets out on these hills?

246
00:53:23,854 --> 00:53:26,823
If he's got himself another horse,
we won't catch him before sundown.

247
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:28,858
I reckon we ought to move
down valley, then.

248
00:53:28,926 --> 00:53:31,292
He won't be heading toward Carson City.

249
00:53:32,162 --> 00:53:34,653
Come on. Let's get off these cursed hills.

250
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,834
You two can go on without me.

251
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:40,864
What?

252
00:53:42,172 --> 00:53:44,663
Those boys have been wanted
for six months.

253
00:53:45,242 --> 00:53:47,574
He's worth 250 in Carson.

254
00:53:48,012 --> 00:53:50,742
That's a damned sight better
than what he's offering.

255
00:53:50,814 --> 00:53:52,941
And this boy don't require no chasing.

256
00:53:53,017 --> 00:53:55,417
- You can't just leave.
- The hell I can't.

257
00:53:55,853 --> 00:53:57,753
You would, too,
if you knew what was good for you.

258
00:53:57,821 --> 00:54:00,688
The posse's take is all yours
when the ride's done.

259
00:54:00,924 --> 00:54:04,985
No less than 120 and you don't have to ride
with a stinking corpse, neither.

260
00:54:07,631 --> 00:54:08,723
All right.

261
00:54:14,672 --> 00:54:15,661
You sure?

262
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:19,704
You go on and get yourself killed. I'm done.

263
00:54:27,117 --> 00:54:28,209
Okay.

264
00:54:48,906 --> 00:54:51,067
Let him earn that 250 the hard way.

265
00:54:51,241 --> 00:54:53,368
He ain't never going to make it
to town without a horse.

266
00:54:53,444 --> 00:54:56,072
I told you boys. Them horses are mine.

267
00:55:31,815 --> 00:55:34,943
We can water your mare.
She looks hard-ridden.

268
00:55:35,619 --> 00:55:38,747
Mercy to the beast is blessed
in the eyes of the Lord.

269
00:55:44,027 --> 00:55:46,052
He sees your sin.

270
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:07,743
That's all you got.

271
00:57:31,768 --> 00:57:33,099
I don't know you.

272
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:08,891
Well, well, well. Looky here.

273
00:58:15,234 --> 00:58:16,360
Boys,

274
00:58:17,102 --> 00:58:20,538
we've caught ourselves a real, live,
notorious criminal.

275
00:58:20,606 --> 00:58:23,473
$250 for that horse-thieving varmint.

276
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:28,707
You ought to have known better
than to steal from the Bar H.

277
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:33,412
Old man McCleeny don't take kindly
to losing horse flesh like this.

278
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:39,455
Want another one? Yeah, fuck you.

279
00:59:07,953 --> 00:59:10,581
- You the foreman?
- Who's looking?

280
00:59:13,692 --> 00:59:16,092
Might have been a man rode through here.

281
00:59:16,361 --> 00:59:19,660
- Tall. Don't talk much.
- Is that so?

282
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:27,068
- I'd like to find him.
- There's nothing for you here.

283
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:31,571
- What do you want with this fella?
- I just want him.

284
00:59:33,645 --> 00:59:36,739
- Is the horse yours?
- Ain't about horses.

285
00:59:36,815 --> 00:59:39,682
'Cause there's been some horse thieves
around these parts.

286
00:59:39,751 --> 00:59:42,447
A lot of men like to see them caught,
you know.

287
00:59:43,422 --> 00:59:45,822
Well, they won't trouble us.

288
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:50,094
I reckon so.

289
00:59:50,362 --> 00:59:54,162
I'd be obliged if we could take water here,
and then we'll leave you to your work.

290
00:59:54,232 --> 00:59:55,221
Yeah.

291
00:59:56,201 --> 00:59:58,396
Lewis here will show you where.

292
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:28,390
Help yourself, Paddy boy.

293
01:00:31,269 --> 01:00:32,395
Shut up.

294
01:00:34,139 --> 01:00:36,539
Gotta piss. I'll find you.

295
01:00:37,909 --> 01:00:39,740
You gonna hold it for me?

296
01:00:43,815 --> 01:00:45,305
Paddy boy.

297
01:00:52,557 --> 01:00:54,616
I said, shut your goddamn mouth.

298
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:26,047
He's gone.

299
01:02:28,019 --> 01:02:30,783
Gone? How in the hell...

300
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:43,131
- All right, you two!
- Yes, sir.

301
01:02:43,201 --> 01:02:44,634
Down by the bridge.

302
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:58,242
Jesus, Mary, Joseph.

303
01:02:58,350 --> 01:02:59,612
All right.

304
01:02:59,684 --> 01:03:01,652
Down that way, idiots.

305
01:03:15,734 --> 01:03:16,996
Open the gate.

306
01:03:29,314 --> 01:03:32,215
Go check on them other two.
I want them out of here.

307
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:58,007
I thought you weren't interested
in horses, mister.

308
01:03:58,710 --> 01:03:59,972
I'm not.

309
01:04:01,246 --> 01:04:05,683
I think it's time you told me
what it is you are interested in here.

310
01:04:08,119 --> 01:04:09,108
Nothing.

311
01:04:12,858 --> 01:04:13,950
Nothing.

312
01:04:16,261 --> 01:04:17,853
I like that.

313
01:04:27,672 --> 01:04:31,938
Like I said, I'd be obliged for some water,
and we'll be on our way.

314
01:04:32,377 --> 01:04:35,005
Suppose you just
be on your way then, huh?

315
01:04:48,159 --> 01:04:51,026
Get up, you big baby. Get your gun!

316
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:53,527
Fuck you.

317
01:05:09,978 --> 01:05:11,206
Let's move.

318
01:06:11,373 --> 01:06:13,534
Pilgrims, you arrived just in time.

319
01:06:15,944 --> 01:06:19,243
May we offer you shelter and fellowship?

320
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:24,741
We can pay if you have some food to spare.

321
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,912
The Lord is bountiful.

322
01:06:26,988 --> 01:06:29,252
Our venison stew is a week in the pot

323
01:06:29,491 --> 01:06:31,356
and fire every day.

324
01:06:35,797 --> 01:06:36,786
Come.

325
01:06:43,672 --> 01:06:45,799
Reckon we ought to camp
somewheres else?

326
01:06:45,874 --> 01:06:48,672
Afraid the word of God
will spoil your digestion?

327
01:06:49,978 --> 01:06:52,173
I never was much for scripture.

328
01:06:53,315 --> 01:06:55,249
Nothing to fear, Mr. Hayes.

329
01:06:55,350 --> 01:06:58,478
Them's just words. Ain't no God out here.

330
01:08:10,025 --> 01:08:12,823
Say, how'd you come by that scar
on your neck?

331
01:08:14,396 --> 01:08:16,796
Indians? Them savages?

332
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,765
No, it was worse.

333
01:08:21,102 --> 01:08:22,091
Mormons.

334
01:08:24,172 --> 01:08:26,936
Praise be to God and a good rifle,

335
01:08:27,576 --> 01:08:29,510
he answered my prayers and not his.

336
01:08:30,512 --> 01:08:33,345
You ought to have a talk with your God
about that.

337
01:08:35,517 --> 01:08:37,712
Figure he ought to be more careful.

338
01:08:38,186 --> 01:08:39,949
You being the chosen folk and all.

339
01:08:40,021 --> 01:08:43,286
Could be he was careful, or I'd be dead.

340
01:08:44,659 --> 01:08:47,787
So, you figure God were on your side then?

341
01:08:51,666 --> 01:08:54,294
He's always on the side
of the righteous, son.

342
01:08:59,641 --> 01:09:02,838
If you don't mind, I'll take his share.

343
01:09:03,645 --> 01:09:06,273
It'll help me digest that fine stew of yourn.

344
01:09:08,316 --> 01:09:11,308
Play something for our guests, children.
No hymns.

345
01:09:12,087 --> 01:09:14,317
- You ready?
- No damn hymns.

346
01:11:14,776 --> 01:11:16,903
Goddamn preacher.

347
01:11:17,045 --> 01:11:20,947
- Did that to yourself.
- Why don't you mind how you talk to me?

348
01:11:22,217 --> 01:11:24,185
It's just you and me out here now.

349
01:11:24,252 --> 01:11:26,345
You go for me, you don't get paid.

350
01:11:26,855 --> 01:11:30,416
Anyway, the noise would make
that head of yours split clean through.

351
01:11:36,798 --> 01:11:38,390
Much obliged.

352
01:11:42,871 --> 01:11:45,203
Don't you ever threaten me again, boy.

353
01:11:45,707 --> 01:11:47,299
Understand?

354
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,285
Check your weapon.

355
01:12:05,026 --> 01:12:07,927
- Oh, shit.
- Goddamn missionaries.

356
01:12:08,229 --> 01:12:10,459
Thieving bastards emptied our guns.

357
01:12:10,532 --> 01:12:13,057
I told you we ought to camp someplace else.

358
01:12:14,703 --> 01:12:17,228
As long as I've still got the one for him,

359
01:12:18,006 --> 01:12:20,167
I guess it don't much matter.

360
01:13:56,137 --> 01:13:58,503
What the hell were they doing out here?

361
01:13:59,374 --> 01:14:01,171
Certain kind of decision.

362
01:14:01,609 --> 01:14:05,136
Once a man makes it,
he can't end up nowhere but here.

363
01:15:59,627 --> 01:16:00,924
You go.

364
01:16:03,464 --> 01:16:04,692
You go, now.

365
01:16:19,948 --> 01:16:21,347
Go now.

366
01:16:54,015 --> 01:16:56,540
What the hell kind of animal has done that?

367
01:16:59,721 --> 01:17:01,018
Shit.

368
01:17:02,156 --> 01:17:04,056
Hell, there ain't no animal...

369
01:17:11,366 --> 01:17:12,924
Get off the horse.

370
01:17:13,301 --> 01:17:15,997
- Easy now. Easy now.
- Yeah.

371
01:17:18,206 --> 01:17:19,605
Get off the horse.

372
01:17:27,582 --> 01:17:29,413
Toss the gun over here.

373
01:17:32,387 --> 01:17:34,287
Just do what he says, Carver.

374
01:17:35,256 --> 01:17:36,484
You do it.

375
01:17:37,692 --> 01:17:38,681
Easy.

376
01:17:58,513 --> 01:18:00,674
On your knees. Now.

377
01:18:09,090 --> 01:18:11,650
Ain't you gonna ask me
to spare you, Captain?

378
01:18:13,127 --> 01:18:15,652
Ain't that what cowards
are supposed to say?

379
01:18:17,265 --> 01:18:18,789
Just as well.

380
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,493
'Cause I ain't planning on it.

381
01:18:23,704 --> 01:18:25,672
Toss that knife over here.

382
01:18:26,874 --> 01:18:30,105
I ain't gonna let you try anything
before I send you down.

383
01:18:32,914 --> 01:18:34,506
Finish it then, huh?

384
01:18:35,616 --> 01:18:37,208
Not so fast.

385
01:18:42,423 --> 01:18:44,254
I've been hunting you for...

386
01:18:46,994 --> 01:18:48,586
I don't know how long.

387
01:18:49,831 --> 01:18:51,799
No sense in rushing it now.

388
01:18:51,866 --> 01:18:53,857
The war is over, sir.

389
01:18:54,669 --> 01:18:56,603
It has been three years.

390
01:18:57,071 --> 01:18:58,868
Won't never be over.

391
01:18:59,707 --> 01:19:01,004
It was war.

392
01:19:04,112 --> 01:19:05,306
War.

393
01:19:07,915 --> 01:19:10,577
War is men fighting, you son of a bitch.

394
01:19:10,785 --> 01:19:12,844
That weren't war what you did.

395
01:19:14,055 --> 01:19:15,317
It was orders.

396
01:19:15,923 --> 01:19:17,788
Orders you gave, Captain.

397
01:19:22,763 --> 01:19:24,355
Yeah. There we go.

398
01:19:25,233 --> 01:19:27,758
All right, Danny, your turn.

399
01:19:28,402 --> 01:19:31,064
Hit it round the edges, nice and hard.

400
01:19:31,639 --> 01:19:34,107
Watch your fingers. Get your balance.

401
01:19:34,542 --> 01:19:37,909
Get your balance. Put that leg over.
Nice and hard now.

402
01:19:37,979 --> 01:19:39,571
Now you're getting it.

403
01:19:41,182 --> 01:19:42,581
Now you got it.

404
01:19:43,451 --> 01:19:44,816
Now you got it.

405
01:19:48,923 --> 01:19:50,754
It's not gonna bite you.

406
01:20:10,845 --> 01:20:12,836
Danny, come here.

407
01:20:22,790 --> 01:20:23,950
Get off this land.

408
01:20:24,025 --> 01:20:26,016
Ma'am, we have it on good information

409
01:20:26,093 --> 01:20:27,856
that this is the home
of Colonel Morsman Carver.

410
01:20:27,929 --> 01:20:30,124
- He's my husband.
- Is he here, ma'am?

411
01:20:30,965 --> 01:20:32,660
No. He's not here.

412
01:20:35,603 --> 01:20:39,505
- Search the house, Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir. House, march.

413
01:20:39,807 --> 01:20:41,741
Show them the hard hand, boys.

414
01:20:48,316 --> 01:20:51,251
- Check upstairs.
- The cellar's clear.

415
01:20:59,527 --> 01:21:01,324
Where's the Colonel, ma'am?

416
01:21:03,564 --> 01:21:05,293
Mind yourself, Lieutenant.

417
01:21:08,336 --> 01:21:09,803
Where is he, ma'am?

418
01:21:12,273 --> 01:21:14,138
Fire the barns. Leave the house.

419
01:21:14,208 --> 01:21:15,732
No! Stop!

420
01:21:16,143 --> 01:21:17,269
- Rose!
- No.

421
01:21:17,945 --> 01:21:19,879
- No!
- Colonel!

422
01:21:23,784 --> 01:21:27,743
- Where are your men, Colonel?
- The war is over. You know the war is over.

423
01:21:29,490 --> 01:21:31,924
- Where are your men?
- I released them.

424
01:21:32,226 --> 01:21:34,490
- Months ago, I released them.
- And the cannon?

425
01:21:34,562 --> 01:21:37,861
Shattered all to hell.
Abandoned outside Atlanta.

426
01:21:37,999 --> 01:21:40,524
Get your hands off me, you Yankee scum.

427
01:21:41,636 --> 01:21:43,763
No! My baby, please!

428
01:21:44,372 --> 01:21:46,840
Let go! Let go!

429
01:21:48,142 --> 01:21:49,302
No!

430
01:21:51,646 --> 01:21:54,080
Rose! Let go of me!

431
01:21:54,181 --> 01:21:55,808
Danny, no!

432
01:21:56,050 --> 01:21:58,143
Danny! Danny, come back...

433
01:22:02,990 --> 01:22:05,618
Danny! Danny, come back!

434
01:22:08,729 --> 01:22:10,594
Oh, God. Somebody, help me.

435
01:22:42,096 --> 01:22:44,087
You said the house was empty.

436
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:50,964
You...

437
01:22:51,572 --> 01:22:53,767
You son of a bitch.

438
01:22:54,675 --> 01:22:56,802
God damn you to hell.

439
01:22:57,244 --> 01:22:58,871
God damn you to hell.

440
01:23:05,386 --> 01:23:07,320
You said the house was empty!

441
01:23:07,521 --> 01:23:10,149
They're Rebs, Captain.

442
01:23:29,477 --> 01:23:31,502
You burned that house.

443
01:23:32,747 --> 01:23:34,180
And them in it.

444
01:23:36,884 --> 01:23:38,374
Your turn now.

445
01:23:41,188 --> 01:23:43,452
"For they that take the sword

446
01:23:45,793 --> 01:23:48,023
"shall perish with the sword."

447
01:24:29,370 --> 01:24:30,962
Enough! Enough!

448
01:24:31,272 --> 01:24:32,671
It's done.

449
01:24:38,412 --> 01:24:39,811
It's done.

450
01:24:44,452 --> 01:24:47,182
Forty miles to Red Rock City.

451
01:24:48,389 --> 01:24:51,517
You head over that ridge, you'll be all right.

452
01:24:55,563 --> 01:24:57,622
You keep coming after me,

453
01:24:59,433 --> 01:25:02,402
you ain't going to find nothing but torment.

454
01:27:54,775 --> 01:27:57,073
You will pay for that life,

455
01:27:58,145 --> 01:28:00,545
or you will pay with yours.

456
01:28:02,249 --> 01:28:04,274
I'm going to fill my skin

457
01:28:04,818 --> 01:28:06,718
and water the horses,

458
01:28:07,121 --> 01:28:08,554
and then I'll be leaving.

459
01:28:08,622 --> 01:28:10,385
That there's life.

460
01:28:11,558 --> 01:28:13,788
Nothing 'round here is free.

461
01:28:15,796 --> 01:28:17,661
Ain't got no gold.

462
01:28:20,334 --> 01:28:22,393
You can look for yourself.

463
01:28:30,077 --> 01:28:32,204
How to value a man's life?

464
01:28:36,350 --> 01:28:37,840
How 'bout

465
01:28:39,186 --> 01:28:40,778
one for another?

466
01:28:45,926 --> 01:28:47,917
The black one is good.

467
01:28:48,562 --> 01:28:50,052
Leave him.

468
01:28:50,464 --> 01:28:51,863
You may go.

469
01:29:58,732 --> 01:30:01,326
"Blessed be the Lord, my strength.

470
01:30:02,970 --> 01:30:06,428
"He teaches my fingers to fight
and my hands to war."

471
01:30:08,942 --> 01:30:10,204
Amen.

472
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:14,711
Come on.

473
01:30:50,684 --> 01:30:52,618
Leave me be, old man.

474
01:30:58,759 --> 01:31:00,283
That your horse?

475
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:01,486
No.

476
01:31:04,298 --> 01:31:05,663
It's yours.

477
01:31:23,116 --> 01:31:24,674
Go as you wish.

478
01:31:25,118 --> 01:31:26,813
That which is yours

479
01:31:26,887 --> 01:31:28,912
will always return to you.

480
01:31:29,890 --> 01:31:31,517
That which you take

481
01:31:31,592 --> 01:31:33,924
will always be taken from you.

482
01:31:47,341 --> 01:31:50,071
That's for the water, not the horse.

483
01:33:32,279 --> 01:33:35,339
A man could die out here if he's not careful.

484
01:33:38,986 --> 01:33:40,453
I didn't see you come up.

485
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:43,546
That's 'cause you keep looking behind you.

486
01:33:47,527 --> 01:33:52,191
Perhaps you'd be interested in a little ration
of Madame Louise's Cure All.

487
01:33:59,206 --> 01:34:03,768
'Course, some say it's the demon rum
in a fancy bottle,

488
01:34:05,479 --> 01:34:07,777
but it'll cure what ails you.

489
01:34:11,618 --> 01:34:13,415
Thank you kindly.

490
01:34:14,388 --> 01:34:15,878
But I'm afraid

491
01:34:16,656 --> 01:34:19,352
ain't no bottle going to sort out my troubles.

492
01:34:19,426 --> 01:34:20,893
You men,

493
01:34:21,361 --> 01:34:24,125
you always choosing a gun over a remedy.

494
01:34:24,197 --> 01:34:27,030
It don't really much matter what I choose.

495
01:34:29,069 --> 01:34:30,536
Got no money either way.

496
01:34:30,604 --> 01:34:32,196
Oh, hell.

497
01:34:32,272 --> 01:34:35,764
I never let that stand in the way
of making a deal.

498
01:34:38,178 --> 01:34:39,907
What's wrong with that .44?

499
01:34:39,980 --> 01:34:41,504
Nothing.

500
01:34:42,783 --> 01:34:44,683
How old's the animal?

501
01:34:46,653 --> 01:34:48,518
I don't really know.

502
01:34:48,588 --> 01:34:50,317
Steal her, did you?

503
01:34:51,391 --> 01:34:52,949
Not exactly.

504
01:34:53,026 --> 01:34:55,051
Spoken like a true sinner.

505
01:34:55,262 --> 01:34:58,197
Well, hell, don't matter much out here.

506
01:34:59,099 --> 01:35:02,432
Man's got to do
what a man's got to do, right?

507
01:35:03,470 --> 01:35:04,459
Yeah.

508
01:35:08,608 --> 01:35:11,099
I suppose we best fix you up.

509
01:35:14,081 --> 01:35:16,015
Cost you the horse.

510
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:29,558
I reckon I ain't getting out of here, anyway.

511
01:35:29,629 --> 01:35:32,928
Hell, I'll even throw in a bottle
of the curative.

512
01:35:50,517 --> 01:35:51,779
Hey,

513
01:35:52,586 --> 01:35:54,918
don't forget your curative.

514
01:37:38,325 --> 01:37:41,920
Look at that sun long enough, you go blind,

515
01:37:44,364 --> 01:37:45,956
or worse,

516
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:47,928
mad.

517
01:37:53,573 --> 01:37:54,870
What the hell do you want?

518
01:37:54,941 --> 01:37:59,310
I'm just a humble peddler offering a cure
to an ailing world.

519
01:37:59,379 --> 01:38:01,540
I ain't looking for no cure.

520
01:38:01,615 --> 01:38:03,845
Why, that's just what your friend said.

521
01:38:03,917 --> 01:38:05,475
That what he's calling himself?

522
01:38:05,552 --> 01:38:07,816
What would you call him?

523
01:38:09,322 --> 01:38:13,349
Somebody who could use a taste
of that Colt of yourn.

524
01:38:16,463 --> 01:38:18,488
Tell you what, stranger.

525
01:38:20,533 --> 01:38:23,559
I got three thirsty animals over there.

526
01:38:24,137 --> 01:38:26,697
I'll trade you this here steel

527
01:38:27,774 --> 01:38:29,867
for that water you got.

528
01:38:52,299 --> 01:38:54,324
What do you say?

529
01:38:55,368 --> 01:38:57,131
Got us a deal?

530
01:38:58,738 --> 01:38:59,932
Yeah.

531
01:39:04,611 --> 01:39:06,579
Just the one shell?

532
01:39:06,646 --> 01:39:08,705
You looking for more?

533
01:39:12,352 --> 01:39:13,842
I reckon not.

534
01:40:28,094 --> 01:40:29,686
Time was,

535
01:40:30,029 --> 01:40:32,463
you said your war was over.

536
01:40:32,532 --> 01:40:35,433
Only the dead can only end a war, Captain.

537
01:41:12,105 --> 01:41:13,504
Go on,

538
01:41:14,574 --> 01:41:15,939
finish it.

539
01:41:45,672 --> 01:41:47,902
I believe it's up to you, sir.

540
01:42:12,198 --> 01:42:13,324
Rose.

541
01:42:17,237 --> 01:42:18,363
Rose.

542
01:42:28,414 --> 01:42:29,711
Forgive me.
