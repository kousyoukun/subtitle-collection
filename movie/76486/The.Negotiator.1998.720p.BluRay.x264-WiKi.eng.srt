1
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,987
Yeah, l like animals better
than people sometimes.

2
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,240
Especially dogs. Dogs are the best.

3
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,367
Every time you come through the door...

4
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,078
...they treat you as if they haven't seen you
in a year.

5
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,830
The good thing about dogs...

6
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,208
...is they got different kinds of dogs
for different kinds of people.

7
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,377
Like pit bulls.

8
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,296
The dog of dogs.

9
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,091
Pit bull can be
the right man's best friend...

10
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,385
...and the wrong man's worst enemy.

11
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:03,265
Yeah, you gonna give me a dog,
give me a pit bull. Give me...

12
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,019
..."Raoull." Right, Omar?
Give me Raoull.

13
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,023
I fucking hate Raoull!
Shut the fuck up, asshole!

14
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,442
Son of a bitch don't
know when to shut up!

15
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,902
Hates Raoull.

16
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,071
Farley fucked up the list.

17
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,951
Yeah, l can dig it, Omar.
I had a dog like that. A poodle.

18
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:26,163
She didn't bark, though.
She pissed on the floor.

19
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,624
Hated that dog.

20
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,918
But if l was ever depressed...

21
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,961
...she'd lay her head in my lap...

22
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,839
...look up at me
with those big old eyes...

23
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:39,092
...and even though I thought
I hated that dog...

24
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,636
...l loved her.

25
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:45,098
It's like that, ain't it, Omar?
That love-hate thing.

26
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,809
No more goddamned talk!

27
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:52,356
I can't wait anymore, you hear me?
I want my wife!

28
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,358
I want her up here.

29
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,861
Or I'll do our daughter.

30
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,492
-Omar, listen to me.
-No more fucking talking.

31
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,661
I want that bitch,
or l'll do the girl.

32
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,247
Omar, l'm doing
the best I can here, man.

33
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,499
I'm not gonna hurt her.

34
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,834
I just want her to see me
blow my brains out.

35
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,670
I want her to think about that...

36
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,839
...when she's sucking
that fat prick's cock.

37
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,807
Roman's losing him.

38
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,686
This guy goes, he could take
that girl with him. We gotta go in.

39
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:34,523
We'll give Danny another minute.
Not yet. He's pulled out of worse.

40
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,317
Another minute, that girl will be dead.

41
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,782
Unit 1, prepare entry.
All units stand by for full breach.

42
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,625
Get back! Get back!

43
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,217
You lost him. Make entry.

44
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,012
Beck thinks you lost him.
Frost gave him the go-ahead.

45
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,055
That's not the play. Omar's tight.

46
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,641
He can get a shot off if they breach.

47
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,394
Look, Nate, I can still talk to him.
I just need time.

48
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:16,481
-HBT 1, negotiator requests time.
-Negative. Team's in position.

49
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,901
Fuck it. I'm going in.

50
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:23,572
No. Don't, damn it. Don't pull this shit.
You'll give him another hostage.

51
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,908
You know another way to get
the gun off the girl's head?

52
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:31,079
-Negotiator entering kill zone.
-You better keep him out.

53
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,373
Our men will lose objectivity
if he's in there.

54
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,001
This is Frost. Stand down.

55
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,589
-Omar was a Marine, right?
-Yeah.

56
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,258
-We have a shot?
-Bedroom, but he's nowhere near.

57
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,011
He will be.
Get Eagle and Palermo to that window.

58
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,848
Tell them to wait for my signal
and put that motherfucker on his back.

59
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,683
Hellman, Allen, Argento.

60
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,271
When l'm clear, come in there,
get that girl.

61
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,274
Yo, Omar.

62
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,445
Just got word. Your wife's here.

63
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,035
- Wife?
- Shut the fuck up.

64
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,454
I've been authorized to make the trade.

65
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,872
I gotta come in, look around...

66
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,626
...make sure there's no other hostages
and there's no surprises.

67
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,087
Fuck you!

68
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,963
I wanna see her first.

69
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:26,635
Omar, l gotta come look. Then l can
bring in your wife, get the girl, all right?

70
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,304
-What if you're lying?
-Then shoot me!

71
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,266
Okay! Fair enough!

72
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,727
Nice and slow!

73
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:42,442
You look around, then l get my wife,
or you fucking die!

74
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,497
Palermo, Eagle, clear for shot.

75
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,291
-Okay? Here we go.
-Ready.

76
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,509
Move real slow.
This ain't about me or you...

77
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,970
...but l'm gonna take you out
just the same.

78
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,184
He's in.
We gotta play it out now.

79
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,686
Unit 1, hold position.

80
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,034
Lock it.

81
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,290
Nice breeze.

82
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:44,463
Great day to be out, you know?
Not cold. Cool, kind of brisk.

83
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,882
Too bad we got stuck in here.

84
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,634
You've seen everything.
No surprise. Let's do this.

85
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:54,347
I gotta look in those rooms down there.
You know, make sure nobody's there.

86
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,558
All right, move.

87
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:02,731
Football, huh?

88
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,317
Perfect day for it.

89
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,447
I ain't missed a Bears home game
since I left the Corps.

90
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,200
Course, the Corps was a winning team,
wasn't it?

91
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,202
Oh, yeah? You were in?

92
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,371
Yeah. l did a tour in '73.

93
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:23,710
Semper fi, motherfucker.
I did two tours. '68 and '69.

94
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,670
Well, hoo-fucking-rah, Omar.

95
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,297
Hoorah!

96
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,092
Don't meet many Marines
these days. Everybody joins the Navy.

97
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,763
I have a visual on the suspect.

98
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:38,934
See? Nothing here, lieutenant,
so now we make the trade.

99
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,436
-Nuh-uh. Stay cool.
-We got a one count.

100
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,108
Like l told you,
gotta check out everything.

101
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:57,911
Omar. A Marine and a sailor
are in the bathroom taking a piss.

102
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,748
The Marine goes to leave
without washing up.

103
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,542
Sailor says:

104
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,295
"ln the Navy, they teach us
to wash our hands."

105
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,340
The Marine turns to him and says:

106
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,885
"ln the Marines, they teach us
not to piss on our hands."

107
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,480
-Down! Get down!
-Move! Move!

108
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,655
-HT's down!
-Copy.

109
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,328
You all right, bud?

110
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:43,498
Huh? You okay?

111
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,584
Yeah.

112
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,255
-Thanks.
-Sure.

113
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,021
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

114
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,561
Yeah, boy! Come on.
Get down, get funky, get loose!

115
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,730
Come on! Do it, do it, do it!

116
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,899
You're a hoedown guy.

117
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,902
-Now l've seen everything.

118
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,156
Okay, which one is
the most pathetic out there?

119
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,075
-How you feeling, man?
-Not great.

120
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,661
-I wanna talk to you. All right?
-All right, cool.

121
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,454
Hey! Cut the music!

122
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,376
Take a wild guess
who's on the news again.

123
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:13,880
After six hours, hostage negotiator
Danny Roman risked his own life...

124
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,257
...disarming the hostage-taker
to end the standoff.

125
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,720
Lieutenant Roman,
looks like you saved the day again.

126
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:24,015
No, it was a team effort.
I just talked the guy out.

127
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,975
Well, did he say anything in there?

128
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,687
He just wanted to hog the spotlight!

129
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,774
I just wanna tell you how close I came
to busting your ass because of that shit.

130
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,944
But because it'll never happen again, right,
I'll let it go.

131
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,445
All right, he's all talk.

132
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:42,117
Danny, off the record,
that was one hell of a gutsy job, man.

133
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,952
Again, congratulations.

134
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,954
Thanks, chief. Congratulations to you.

135
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,163
-Thanks.
-Great party.

136
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,790
Were you really in the Marines?

137
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,126
No, l was in the Army
and l fucking hate dogs.

138
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:57,215
Despite how things worked out today,
you put these guys in jeopardy.

139
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:01,094
If you were taken hostage,
you would've fucked up everything.

140
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,806
-Everybody lived, Beck. Even you.

141
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,775
Twenty thousand cops in Chicago.
Can't you take turns?

142
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,153
I was gonna let Nate go in...

143
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,655
...but l knew Linda would be pissed
at me.

144
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,324
Nate's much smarter than that,
right, Nate?

145
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,578
Yeah, l'm too smart.
I'm too smart for my own good sometimes.

146
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,124
You got a minute? Gotta talk.
It's important.

147
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,085
Just be a minute, l promise.
Just a minute.

148
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,338
Go on, tell your secrets.

149
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,358
I was approached by someone recently.

150
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,696
He knows who took money
from the disability fund.

151
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,448
What?

152
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,617
-Almost 2 million is missing.
-Yeah, I know.

153
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:10,121
According to him,
we know the guys who took it. Cops.

154
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,333
Guys in our own precinct.
Guys we might call our friends...

155
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,376
...stealing our own money.

156
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,671
I would've told you sooner,
but this is my first chance.

157
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,507
Who told you this?

158
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:22,717
I can't say...

159
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,095
...but this guy knows what he's
talking about.

160
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:29,140
He's been around, working cases like this.
He knows his shit.

161
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,184
So why didn't he go to Internal Affairs?

162
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:34,854
Because he thinks lnternal Affairs
is involved.

163
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:38,066
He heard Niebaum's name mentioned.
He doesn't know what to do.

164
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,695
They offered to buy him out.

165
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,824
-And?
-And he said he'd think about it.

166
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,410
We were at the academy,
worked Area 6 together, so he trusts me.

167
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,246
This guy, uh....

168
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,082
Dan, this guy is really scared.

169
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,709
When did you find out
about all this?

170
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,797
Most of it last night, but l, uh....

171
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:04,050
I've been working on it
for a couple of weeks now, you know?

172
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,679
I figured that with you on the board
you might have heard something.

173
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,472
No.

174
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,765
I didn't hear a thing.

175
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,687
Well, they did do an audit,
but it didn't prove anything.

176
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,522
Yeah.

177
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,567
If somebody's stealing our money,
we gotta find out who.

178
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:21,776
You tell this informant--

179
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,738
-Oh, shit.
-Jesus Christ!

180
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:26,948
Officer Bald.

181
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,243
Are you blowing each other?

182
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,287
About to, till you showed up.

183
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:35,790
I know you're all partners,
but everyone's looking for you.

184
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,792
Don't shine the light in here, officer.

185
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,795
Can't a guy just hold his partner's hand?

186
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,381
I'll let you girls be.

187
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:48,303
-Wipe that stuff off your mouth, buddy.
-Yeah. Order me a drink, big guy.

188
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,513
Jesus.

189
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,641
-We'll finish this later.
-Yeah, all right.

190
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,606
Yeah. Don't tell Linda.

191
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,817
Shit.

192
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,697
I don't like the thought
of fixing up this house alone, Danny.

193
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,324
And with what you're doing....

194
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:13,161
Nuh-uh-uh. Darling, that's the job.

195
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,830
It's not the job.

196
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:20,335
The job l can deal with.
It's how you do the job.

197
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,837
-Like what you did today.
-I'm fine.

198
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,422
This time.

199
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,217
What l love about you is that you do
these crazy things.

200
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:33,181
It's just that l wish you'd start
differentiating between crazy and stupid.

201
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,725
I know this whole marriage thing
is new to you...

202
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:39,520
...but coming home every night
is a big part of it.

203
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,189
Every night.

204
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,483
Okay. l promise...

205
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,694
...l will come home every night.

206
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,367
No matter what l have to do.

207
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,036
Every night.

208
00:15:56,038 --> 00:16:00,124
What are you trying to negotiate?
You forget that l know you lie for a living.

209
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,751
-Not right now.
-Oh!

210
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,253
Listen, listen.

211
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:08,216
Danny Roman is a married man now.

212
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,344
No more crazy shit, all right?

213
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,515
See that?

214
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,851
That's the bus.
The bus is going down the street.

215
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:22,772
Crazy is on the bus.

216
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,780
What's vibrating, baby?

217
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,161
Nate is vibrating.

218
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,874
Go. Tell Nate I said hello.

219
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:46,671
And that I expect him to keep
you out of trouble from now on.

220
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:17,118
Hey, how you doing? Caught me.
Heh, heh.

221
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,871
Look, Danny beeped me earlier.
What's going on?

222
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,293
Nate?

223
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,520
Freeze!

224
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,022
Get your hands up!

225
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,858
Police officer! Officer down!

226
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,114
He said he talked
to his informant last night.

227
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:40,535
Some guy he was at academy with
and knew from Area 6.

228
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:45,373
This guy said he knew what was
going down with the pension fund.

229
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,419
The informant didn't come
to you guys...

230
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,801
...because he thought someone
from lnternal Affairs was involved.

231
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,221
One of us?

232
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,103
Exactly who was this informant,
lieutenant?

233
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,230
Hey, he didn't tell me his name.

234
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,901
It's obvious somebody found out
Nate was investigating the fund...

235
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,404
...off this informant's tip
and they took him out.

236
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:20,032
Let's go back to the beginning
and do this whole thing again.

237
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,077
Hey, hey, hey. l just found my partner
with his head blown off.

238
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,705
-I don't feel like doing this!
-You're gonna have to.

239
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:26,998
-Fuck this!
-Back off.

240
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,918
Back off, Niebaum.
We'll do it some other time, okay?

241
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,553
Order!

242
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,846
Order!

243
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:26,784
I'm so sorry. l'm sorry.

244
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,540
Ready. Aim. Fire.

245
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,378
Aim. Fire.

246
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,884
Aim. Fire.

247
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,641
-Is that the door?
-Mm. You get it.

248
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,101
Shit.

249
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:04,071
Hey, Danny, listen, they found the gun
that killed Nathan.

250
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:07,742
-It's in the lake. No fingerprints.
-Hang on. He's--

251
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,744
-I have a search warrant--
-Just hold it.

252
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:13,789
Danny, the serial number on the gun--
It was one of three stolen from a dealer.

253
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:17,084
Two of the guns were recovered by you
around seven months ago.

254
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:20,755
-The third gun was not found until now.
-You gotta be fucking kidding me.

255
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,923
-You serious?
-Nothing we can do.

256
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,344
We came as soon as we heard
they were issuing a warrant.

257
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,555
-Guys, go easy. He's one of ours.
-In here. In here.

258
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:41,025
I'm sorry about this, Karen.
We all know it's bullshit.

259
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,277
Just let them do their work and get out.

260
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,404
It is bullshit.

261
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,449
He's standing over a dead cop
who was investigating the fund...

262
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,285
...he had access to the gun
and he's on the fund's board.

263
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:54,747
-He had motive and opportunity.
-Who the fuck are you, Niebaum?

264
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:58,292
It was your name Nate mentioned
when he said Internal Affairs was involved.

265
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,294
Now it's my name, huh?

266
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:04,924
We've got an investigation too, and your
name keeps coming up. Wonder why.

267
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:09,053
Maybe it's because Nathan found you
stealing money from the fund.

268
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:16,644
Inspector!

269
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,980
I think l got something in here.

270
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,987
Looks like offshore accounts.

271
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,120
What the--?

272
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:37,123
That shit's not mine.
You planted this shit.

273
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,749
Put it away.

274
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,836
Why are you doing this to me, huh?

275
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,629
Chief, you don't--

276
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,182
Lieutenant, do you think you'll be charged...

277
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,892
...with the murder of Officer Roenick?

278
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,770
Think you'll be charged
with the murder of Officer Roenick?

279
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,940
Make a hole here.
Come on, come on, back up.

280
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,734
-Hey! Give the guy a break!
-Get back. Get back.

281
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,201
Beck.

282
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,830
-Thanks.
-How can you show your face here?

283
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,334
I knew someday
you'd get somebody killed.

284
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,212
Nobody really knows
what happened, okay?

285
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,339
Come on, seriously.

286
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:31,343
What's going on, Danny?
We're hearing a lot of shit.

287
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,388
What?

288
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,765
Hey, Danny.

289
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:38,726
Come on inside.

290
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:43,189
All right, everybody, get back to work.

291
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,239
Sit down, Danny.

292
00:24:56,203 --> 00:25:00,748
Danny, I'm gonna be honest with you.
I don't know what to think...

293
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,709
...but l don't have any choice...

294
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:07,171
...until this lnternal Affairs investigation
is complete.

295
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,426
So your gun and your badge.

296
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:16,931
Chief.

297
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,433
You know me.

298
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,895
I'm being set up.

299
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,066
Nate told me
his informant knows who's involved.

300
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:30,277
Help me find this informant,
and all this goes away.

301
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,281
Yeah.

302
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,428
Lieutenant!

303
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,395
-Have you talked to Mrs. Roenick?
-One more.

304
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,522
Are you allowed to make any comment?

305
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:04,288
-Linda. Linda.
-We should keep going.

306
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,041
-No, Karen.
-Mrs. Roenick, we should go.

307
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:11,629
Linda, l didn't do what they say I did. I--

308
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:15,174
-Mrs. Roenick, we should go.
-Fuck you, Danny.

309
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:21,388
Fuck Niebaum. Fuck all of you.
You all killed him.

310
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,892
Don't you stand here.
Don't you stand here in my face.

311
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,144
Don't say one more fucking word to me.

312
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,897
You took him away from me.

313
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:34,026
God help you, Danny.
You took him away from Jeremy.

314
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:38,947
Now you stand here--
You stand here and you just live with that.

315
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:42,660
Mrs. Roenick. Please, let's go home.

316
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,374
Danny, we need to go.

317
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,418
We need to go.
Come on, this way.

318
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:56,590
The papers found in your house:

319
00:27:57,258 --> 00:28:00,761
Can you come up with an explanation
as to why you had that kind of money?

320
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,097
You have no proof the money
had to do with the fund...

321
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:05,683
...or that Mr. Roman
even opened those accounts.

322
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,018
The money in them was well-laundered...

323
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:11,689
...but the last deposit matched
the last amount stolen from the fund.

324
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,899
I don't have any offshore accounts.

325
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:17,111
The statements were in your home.
You were standing over the body.

326
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:20,447
Are you charging my client?
Because all of this is circumstantial.

327
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,742
We have a gun linked to you...

328
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,453
...and a pair of gloves that we took
from the water.

329
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:31,125
Which explains why your client
had no powder on his hands.

330
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,505
You know how this city feels
about corrupt cops.

331
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,133
I'll get a conviction
with my eyes closed.

332
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:44,430
Just tell us where the rest of the money
went, who your partners were and maybe....

333
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,974
-Maybe--
-I need to speak to my client.

334
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,604
I'll give you one day to make a deal.

335
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,649
You hear me? One day.

336
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,235
After that, there'll be no deal
to negotiate.

337
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:02,781
We will arrest you and you will
face the maximum penalty. I'll see to it.

338
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:09,288
Be here tomorrow
and have a decision made.

339
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:19,339
Danny. Danny.

340
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,318
Danny.

341
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,653
-Danny.
-What?

342
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:47,075
Understand that they have a case
that a jury will convict on.

343
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,994
I can't do any more for you.

344
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,538
Cut a deal.

345
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,009
Karen.

346
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:09,348
Go and wait for me in the car.
Don't worry.

347
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,558
Everything's gonna be fine.

348
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:14,978
-Danny, please don't do anything crazy.
-Crazy? Heh.

349
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,564
Crazy's on the bus, remember?

350
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,236
I love you.

351
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,669
I love you too.

352
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,337
Be right back.

353
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,292
-Danny Roman
-I'm going to see Niebaum.

354
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:21,461
Sir, could you wait
just a minute? l have to buzz him, sir.

355
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:24,047
Mr. Roman, wait, sir!

356
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,093
You made it clear--
Make it clear again.

357
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,469
Come on. This is--

358
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:37,144
Hold on. Hold on.
Roman. What can I do for you?

359
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,939
Man's got a right to face his accusers,
doesn't he, inspector?

360
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:43,317
-We need to talk.
-Go ahead, talk.

361
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,819
I wanna know what's going on.

362
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,160
You killed your partner and you're about
to be formally indicted for it.

363
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,662
You're not answering my question.

364
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,123
Nate told me you were involved.
I wanna know how.

365
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,629
Look me in the eye
and tell me you weren't involved.

366
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:06,173
-Look me in the eye!
-Look you in the eye for what?

367
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,634
Lookit, why don't you tell it
to the judge?

368
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:11,261
All right? We're finished.
Get him out of here.

369
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,597
-You're not doing this!
-Look, you. Go!

370
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,643
Roman.

371
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,105
No!

372
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,444
Fuck.

373
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,614
Lock the door. Lock it!

374
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,034
Don't make things
worse than they already are.

375
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,870
-Just put the gun down now.
-You, sit your ass down.

376
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,122
-Sit!
-Okay, man, you got it.

377
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,376
This is my life here, Niebaum.

378
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,463
-I want some answers.
-I don't have any answers.

379
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,131
Put the gun down and leave.

380
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:52,052
You don't feel like talking?
We're gonna stay here until you do.

381
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,137
It's your choice...

382
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:58,058
...because I'm not going to jail today.

383
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,064
Move!

384
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,693
Go! Go!

385
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,112
-All right.
-Come on!

386
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,739
Drop your weapon.

387
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:15,242
-Drop it, Danny.
-Guns down.

388
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:18,036
-Drop the weapon.
-Drop it.

389
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,583
That wasn't an accident. And neither
will the next one that goes in your head.

390
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:26,503
Now get down here, now.
Come on!

391
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:30,257
All right, everybody in here march over
to that desk over there.

392
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,427
Put your guns, cuffs,
keys, everything...

393
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:37,097
...on this desk and get out of here.
Let's go. Move! Move it!

394
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,766
-Take it easy.
-Danny.

395
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:42,769
-What are you doing here?
-The call's out on the city-wide.

396
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:46,106
-See what they're making me do?
-Danny, you just got married, man.

397
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,774
Think about Karen.

398
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,445
I am thinking about Karen.

399
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:55,240
And now that l think about it,
I'm glad you're here.

400
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,409
You just raised the ante.

401
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,121
-Join the party.
-God, Danny, this is crazy.

402
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:04,458
Take your guns off.
Put them on this table now!

403
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:11,590
I know you heard me say
both of them.

404
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:56,009
Danny, listen to me.
It's not too late to stop this.

405
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,136
You trying to talk me down? That it?

406
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:01,014
Danny, this is crazy.
This isn't helping you.

407
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,726
-Me and him have nothing to do with this.
-Right.

408
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,978
I've known you 20 years.
What are you doing?

409
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:10,982
I know l made you stay, Frost, but you
cannot monopolize the conversation.

410
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:15,195
You're not the scene commander here.
I am. You.

411
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,990
You're Niebaum's secretary, right?
What's your name?

412
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:21,368
My name's Maggie, and l'm his assistant.

413
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,870
Maggie, don't be scared.

414
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:26,748
I'm somewhat familiar
with situations like this, all right?

415
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,876
I'm not scared. l've been mugged twice,
once at gunpoint.

416
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:32,045
Guns are not new to me...

417
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,548
...but l'd rather avoid them
if I get the chance.

418
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:38,093
Well, I don't think you're gonna
have that chance this time, Maggie.

419
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:42,514
And if you're Niebaum's assistant,
you have everything to do with this.

420
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:47,144
But not me, bro. Okay?
I don't work for this pig.

421
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,104
-I'm not a cop.
-You're Rudy Timmons.

422
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:52,899
You're a rat for the rat squad.
You don't remember me?

423
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,027
I arrested you in '92
for credit-card fraud.

424
00:35:56,195 --> 00:36:00,073
Oh, shit. Yeah, wow.
Yeah, l remember you.

425
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,242
I remember you. Hey, man!

426
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,245
Last time I saw you,
you were a clean-cut boy in blue.

427
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:09,374
-What happened to you, man?
-That's what we're here to find out, Rudy.

428
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,927
Air 1, realize the location.

429
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,264
I wonder if they're out there.

430
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,933
Your partners, Niebaum.

431
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,020
The guilty ones.

432
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:31,605
My guys.

433
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,774
They'll come, you know.

434
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:38,278
Scared shitless l'll get the truth out of you
and try and stop them.

435
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,281
And if they can't get me,
they'll kill you.

436
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:01,801
Goddamn it. Have them clear the perimeter
and start evac.

437
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,642
I don't want anything moving
on that fucking river!

438
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,482
Locate the phone panel.
Lock down the elevator.

439
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:19,486
Have these guys clear the stairwell.
Have Unit 2 hold outside lnternal Affairs.

440
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,071
You got it. Come on.

441
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,657
-Chief?
-Christ, they're here already.

442
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:27,911
Set up command on that barge over there
so the press can't get to us.

443
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,221
What do you got?

444
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,890
We locked down the elevators
from the 20th floor down.

445
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:34,394
-Beck.
-Let's get the phones hooked up.

446
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:36,563
I got a real concern.

447
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,733
He knows our tactics and we got
a lot of real estate to lock down.

448
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,192
Do we have the manpower?

449
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:44,195
We got personnel from
six different districts...

450
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,574
...but he's still gonna try and control
the environment.

451
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,202
We'll just see who wins the race.

452
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,406
Perpetrator is an expert marksman.

453
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:31,493
He's an expert in explosives and tactics.

454
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:35,038
Gentlemen, play this by the numbers.

455
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,415
Maintain your fields of fire.

456
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:48,259
Elevators.

457
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,150
Fucking Roman's up there, man.

458
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:06,194
He's got Frost inside.

459
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,239
See a chance to end this,
we take him out.

460
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,831
We're blind and he's seeing 20-20.

461
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,499
-Intel?
-Yeah.

462
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:22,085
I want visuals and audio
set up from 19 and 21.

463
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,170
-Yes, sir.
-Farley, you're negotiating.

464
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:26,423
-He'll eat Farley up.
-Commander, uh...

465
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:31,594
-...if you wanna talk to him....
-You can't handle it, I won't have a choice.

466
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:36,433
Get him locked down first. ln the meantime,
Farley, get on the fucking phone.

467
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,604
-Someone locate the building engineer.
-Right away.

468
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,357
Oh, boy.

469
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,541
Chief Travis.

470
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:07,213
Special Agents Grey,
this is Moran.

471
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,716
We're the FBl negotiators.

472
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,720
It's a federal building.
It's our jurisdiction.

473
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,055
He's one of ours. We got this.

474
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:18,141
Fine with us. For now.

475
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,691
Chief. We got eyes.

476
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,919
Son of a bitch. Go to Camera 2.

477
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:07,106
He got all six. We got nothing.

478
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,528
We gotta see in that room.

479
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:17,575
No eyes, no ears.
Looks like we're running out of options.

480
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:20,703
-I want status reports now.
-Give me an update.

481
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,499
Give me status.

482
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,626
Somebody give me status.
Tell me what you see.

483
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,711
All shafts are locked down, sir.

484
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,964
Blinds closed.

485
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,341
Visibility's zero, sir.

486
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:34,968
We contained him.

487
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,720
We have not contained him.
He's contained himself.

488
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,138
He's cut us off.

489
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:41,849
Try the phone again. See what he wants.

490
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:49,482
Talk.

491
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:51,985
Hello?

492
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,823
Yeah. Hello?

493
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:00,618
I'm Rudy, so don't shoot me
thinking I'm him. Please.

494
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:04,664
Rudy, my name is Farley.

495
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:09,961
-Could you please get Danny on the line?
-Farley would like to talk to you.

496
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,338
Tell him l only wanna talk
to Chris Sabian.

497
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,093
He'll only talk to, uh, Chris Sabian.

498
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:20,847
Tell him if Sabian's not here in 20 minutes,
you die.

499
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:26,185
I don't wanna talk to anyone else
but Chris Sabian.

500
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,021
Okay.

501
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:29,522
We heard you.

502
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,859
He said they heard you.

503
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,495
Who's Chris Sabian?

504
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,707
-I heard that name before.
-He's from the west side.

505
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:51,377
Once he talked 55 hours.
Never forces tactical action.

506
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,047
I don't know how Danny knows him.

507
00:43:57,509 --> 00:44:00,345
-So find Sabian.
-911 Chris Sabian.

508
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,226
Come on.

509
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,062
Talk to me.

510
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:11,731
I'm right here.

511
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:16,069
I'm not going anywhere,
so please come out.

512
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:19,238
You don't want me to come out.
I wanna kill her.

513
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,449
I do want you to come out.
Come out...

514
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,326
...so we can discuss this.

515
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,578
You're not even listening to me.

516
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:28,373
Yes, l am listening to you.

517
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:33,127
I just-- You promised that you'd come out,
so come on out, all right?

518
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:35,588
I don't wanna do this through the door.

519
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,345
Look, l just wanna do something
without arguing, okay?

520
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:43,554
Let's get on the road.

521
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:46,015
-Your clothes look fine.
-No.

522
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:48,685
-They do.
-According to some people...

523
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,853
...l look fat in ski clothes.

524
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:54,774
That's not the word she used.
She used...

525
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,778
...a much worse word.

526
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,199
Honey, get off the phone!

527
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:04,992
-Get off the phone.
-I know.

528
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:07,286
-Get off the phone.
-No.

529
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:10,248
I'm your father
and l'm very upset with you right now.

530
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,959
Try your sweater.

531
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,086
Honey, but get off the phone.

532
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,963
I want you to apologize...

533
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,215
...to your mother for saying she looks...

534
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:20,800
..."wide."

535
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:25,054
That's not a good word to use, wide.

536
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,639
How'd you like to be called wide?

537
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,641
You hear me? l'm very serious.

538
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:29,851
I'm very angry with you!

539
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:33,312
Right now. Get off the phone.
Get off the phone.

540
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:34,689
-No.
-Don't you make me--

541
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,694
I talked a man out of
blowing up the Sears Tower...

542
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,947
...but l can't talk my wife out
of a bedroom or my kid off a phone.

543
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:47,160
That's because no one's standing
behind you with a big gun.

544
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,495
Yeah, well, that's debatable.

545
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,248
Hold on.

546
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,584
Hello?

547
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,127
Yeah. He's right here.

548
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:57,837
It's for you.

549
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,590
Hello?

550
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:07,180
Sabian's 20 minutes out.

551
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,557
And we only got 15.

552
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:12,018
All right, call Danny
and change that deadline.

553
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,854
Tell him Sabian's on his way.

554
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,698
Sabian?

555
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:28,868
No, it's, um, Farley.

556
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:32,455
Look, Farley, l told you, I don't wanna talk
to anyone but Chris Sabian.

557
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,874
Yeah, uh, he's on his way, okay?

558
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,710
He's gonna be here real soon.
We just need more time.

559
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:39,629
You don't have more time, Farley.

560
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,214
Danny, please, tell me.

561
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:43,966
What are you doing here, okay?
This is pretty serious.

562
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,886
You're goddamn right!
So why don't you take me seriously?

563
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,388
Well, we are. We are. We just, um....

564
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:53,392
-It just, um-- I just want to talk to you.
-Wait, wait.

565
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,562
Wait, wait.
You think you can talk me down, Farley?

566
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:00,191
Look, um, I need to, um....

567
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,402
-Tell me what you want, all right?
-Heh.

568
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,488
Okay, Farley.

569
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,616
You want a shot? I'll give you a shot.

570
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:11,869
Yeah. We got some time
before Sabian gets here.

571
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:16,541
Oh. What do I want? Um, let's see.
How about-- Can l see a priest?

572
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,335
No, you can't see a priest.

573
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,588
That's good, Farley. Good.
You shouldn't let me see a priest.

574
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:26,717
A priest is associated with death, and you
don't want me thinking about death.

575
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,053
No, no.

576
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,639
But you told me "no."
You can't say "no."

577
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,559
Never use "no" in a hostage situation.

578
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:37,353
-Would you relax?
-I'm very fucking relaxed!

579
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,063
But let me give you some advice:

580
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:42,733
Never say "no" to a hostage-taker.
It's in the manual.

581
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:45,945
-Now, are you gonna tell me "no" again?
-No, I'm not.

582
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:50,116
Wrong answer! Eliminate "no"
from your vocabulary.

583
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:53,411
Never use "no," "don't,"
"won't" or "can't," all right?

584
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:56,163
It eliminates options.
The only option that leaves...

585
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:58,207
...is to shoot someone. Understand?

586
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:01,961
-Uh, yes. Yes, l do.
-Yes! Good! See, "yes" is good.

587
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:05,673
Say "no" again, l'll kill somebody, all right?
Now, let's practice.

588
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:06,924
Can l see a priest?

589
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:10,595
Uh, let's not-- You know what?
Can we just talk--

590
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:14,265
You wanted to talk. We are talking.
Now, can l see a priest?

591
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,642
Uh, l'll see what I can do.

592
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,812
That's good, Farley.
Now you're learning.

593
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,816
I'd like a submachine gun,
so l can blow everyone away.

594
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:26,819
-I'll look into that.
-Good. You're doing good, Farley.

595
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:28,905
You ever cheat on your wife?

596
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:32,825
-No.
-Watch yourself. l'll kill someone.

597
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:36,120
You ever cheat on your wife? Answer!

598
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:37,997
I'll see what I can do.

599
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:42,293
I'll have to think about that.
Um, I'll look into that.

600
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,170
You ever, um...

601
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:47,173
...dress up like a schoolgirl
and get you ass spanked?

602
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:51,135
Danny, look, okay, all right,
all l wanna do is talk to you.

603
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:53,512
I am talking! Now, did you
or did you not...

604
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,766
...ever dress up like a schoolgirl
and get your ass spanked?

605
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:00,102
-Have to look into that, Danny.
-Jesus, Farley.

606
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:05,858
Nothing against you dressing up like a girl,
but I didn't know that about you, Farley.

607
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:09,695
-Danny, this is really unproductive.
-Unproductive?

608
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:11,614
You're right. It is.

609
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:15,493
So tell me a joke, Farley.
You know any jokes?

610
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:16,786
-No.
-No?

611
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,538
You just cost someone their life, Farley!
Game over!

612
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,458
Shot fired.

613
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,380
Shot fired. Shot fired. Can anyone see?

614
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,720
-Uh.... Uh....
-Don't let him go.

615
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:41,227
You can't talk me down!
You can't make me change the deadline!

616
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,437
Now get me Sabian!

617
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:47,566
You got six minutes, 42, 41...

618
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:50,403
- Forty!
-Listen, Danny, is anybody hurt?

619
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:51,570
Is anybody hurt?

620
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:55,032
We're okay. Just don't be saying
"no" no more, motherfucker!

621
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:57,743
Oh, fuck.

622
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:00,579
-Everybody calm down.
-I'm so sorry. No, l'm so sorry.

623
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,415
I'm so fucking sorry.

624
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,333
Give me status.

625
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:07,086
Somebody give me status.
Tell me what you see.

626
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,005
Visibility zero, sir.

627
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,552
Just a few moments ago...

628
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,472
...a single shot was fired
inside the city administration building.

629
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,725
We, of course,
could not hear it down here--

630
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:23,936
We got the whole city
of Chicago watching this.

631
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:27,606
This could turn into a press nightmare.

632
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,862
What do we do if Sabian can't make it?

633
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:36,782
We gotta remember
that that's Danny Roman upstairs.

634
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:40,453
We've worked with the guy for 12 years
and don't really know what he's done.

635
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,663
We know what he's doing now.

636
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:48,461
I don't want this to get personal for us.

637
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:52,381
He's obviously over--
Hey, do you mind?

638
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:01,599
He's obviously gone over the edge.

639
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,142
This is not personal.

640
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:08,481
If l thought sending these guys, my team in
would put more people in jeopardy...

641
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,608
...l wouldn't consider it.

642
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:16,197
I don't wanna go in there,
but it's our best option.

643
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:17,990
He can't be talked down.

644
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:22,036
They'll get us out.
Don't worry about Danny.

645
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,038
-He's not gonna hurt anybody.
-Bullshit.

646
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:27,166
No one knows what this
crazy fucker is gonna do.

647
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:29,502
This has nothing to do with me
and Maggie.

648
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:32,171
You know, you're his friend.
You get him to let us go.

649
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:35,674
Because once you familiarize yourself
with the chains of bondage...

650
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:38,719
...you prepare your own limbs
to wear them.

651
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:41,222
Fucking Abraham Lincoln said that
and l believe it.

652
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:44,683
So you have gotta get me
the fuck out! Now!

653
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:49,355
Do yourself a favor and keep quiet.
We'll handle this.

654
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:53,150
Don't tell me to be quiet and don't
tell me you can fucking handle it...

655
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:56,320
...because none of you ever been
in a situation like this before.

656
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:59,698
-Just shut the fuck up.
-Fuck you!

657
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:01,992
-Prick.
-All right, that's enough.

658
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,496
He's gonna hear you out there,
and he's got the gun, so he's in charge.

659
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,040
Both of you need to pipe down.

660
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:16,382
Danny. I think you should let Maggie go.
She's not involved.

661
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,217
She's a woman,
and it's only fair--

662
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:21,720
I didn't ask to be let go because
I'm a woman. l hate that crap.

663
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:26,183
Me and him should be let go
because we had nothing to do with this.

664
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:29,103
-It's between you cops.
-We have nothing to do with this.

665
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:33,149
Danny, Danny, look,
I'm not some just dirt merchant...

666
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:34,942
...loose in the street anymore.

667
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:38,571
I'm not. l got a nice new lady friend
that l would like to get back to.

668
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:42,658
And she has got this kid, Albert.
Ah, super kid, Dan.

669
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:46,120
-Great kid.
-Dan, what do you think you can do?

670
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:47,997
Take a look at that screen.

671
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:53,043
They think you're a killer, Danny.
They're gonna try to take you out.

672
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:56,422
What do you think Sabian can do?
He can't do anything to stop this.

673
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,424
What about you, Frosty?

674
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,968
You think I'm a killer too, huh?

675
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:02,303
Come on.

676
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:05,514
You've known me for 20 years.

677
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:08,434
You think I killed Nate?

678
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,066
I don't know what to think, Danny.

679
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:18,861
I'll tell you this, Danny boy:

680
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,906
What you're doing is not helping.

681
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:41,884
Hey, schoolgirl.

682
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:47,139
You still sweating that ugly display
you gave us all a few minutes ago?

683
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:51,894
Stop kicking yourself in the ass.
We all have our bad days. Beck.

684
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:55,272
Stop trying to figure out
how to get in here. I'm well bunkered.

685
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,609
Palermo, take that toothpick out
of your mouth.

686
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,904
Wouldn't want you to swallow it
if something goes down.

687
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,156
That's right, sports fans...

688
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:06,242
...it's me, Danny Roman.

689
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,410
The man upstairs.

690
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:12,498
Just wanted to say hello before the curtain
goes up on this little drama.

691
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:16,794
I guess you're all wondering
why we're here.

692
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:18,837
Well, it's simple.

693
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:22,424
We're here to find out
who took our money...

694
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:26,011
...and who killed Nate,
because it wasn't me.

695
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,806
There's some bad cops among us...

696
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:32,601
...and today we're gonna find out
who they are.

697
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,187
Now, I know how that sounds.

698
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,189
I know what you're thinking:

699
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:40,109
"He's gone. He's a murderer."

700
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:44,363
But l'm that same son of a bitch
you trusted your lives with...

701
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:47,324
...played softball with,
went drinking with.

702
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:52,329
I'm the same guy you invited to your house
to celebrate your kid's baptism, Tonray.

703
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:54,456
The same guy who saved Palermo's ass...

704
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:57,626
...when that sniper had a bead
on him at the stadium gig.

705
00:54:58,044 --> 00:55:00,087
This is good, huh?

706
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:03,841
Danny's trying to get us to Stockholm
so we think twice about taking him out.

707
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,677
Now, I want--

708
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:09,388
No, l need you guys...

709
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:12,224
...to understand
that I had no choice here.

710
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:16,228
My life was being stripped away from me.

711
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:18,731
First, they kill Nate.

712
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,737
Then they took my badge.

713
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:26,739
Then you guys.

714
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:28,824
Next...

715
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:33,287
...they were gonna take away my wife
by sending me to prison.

716
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:35,331
And that...

717
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,666
...l cannot take.

718
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:41,003
I can't live without--

719
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,178
Put yourself in my position.

720
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,097
What else could I do?

721
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:55,726
Get word out to our team.
We're switching to frequency three.

722
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,102
-Yes, sir.
-Run.

723
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:02,024
I tried to tell everyone l was being set up,
but no one wanted to listen.

724
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,693
Well, now you have no choice.

725
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:07,446
You got to listen,
because we're not leaving here...

726
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:10,157
...until l find out who set me up.

727
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:13,619
Let me warn you:

728
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:17,581
Whoever killed Nate is frightened
that Niebaum might know something.

729
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,667
They're going to try and end this quickly.

730
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:22,711
Another warning:

731
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:27,883
I know the rules of engagement,
so don't test me.

732
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:32,930
You got four minutes
to get Sabian here...

733
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:36,767
...or you'll find out
just how serious l really am.

734
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:55,077
I want you to look me
in the eye, Niebaum.

735
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:56,995
Right here.

736
00:56:58,498 --> 00:56:59,581
Now, tell me...

737
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:04,503
...when did you find out Nate
was investigating the fund?

738
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:17,349
I first found that Nathan
was conducting the investigation...

739
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:19,643
...after l spoke with you
after he was killed.

740
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:23,814
You're lying.
And I know you're lying.

741
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,984
Oh, you know it, huh?
You can read my mind, Roman, is that it?

742
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:29,862
No, l'm not. l'm reading your eyes.

743
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,697
The eyes can't lie.

744
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:34,658
Didn't you know what I was doing?

745
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:39,705
A quick lesson in lying.
See, this is what us real cops do.

746
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,498
We study liars.

747
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:42,708
Example:

748
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:46,503
If l ask you a question about
something visual, like your favorite color...

749
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:49,381
...and your eyes go up and to the left...

750
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:52,885
...neurophysiology tells us
that your eyes go that in that direction...

751
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:55,137
...because you're accessing
the visual cortex.

752
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,598
Therefore, you're telling the truth.

753
00:57:57,765 --> 00:58:00,309
If your eyes go up and right...

754
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,728
...you access the creative centers
of the brain...

755
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:04,771
-...and we know you're full of shit.
-Uh-huh.

756
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:07,065
Now, let's try this again.

757
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,860
What's your favorite television show?

758
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:12,863
I'm not gonna play
your stupid fucking game, okay, Roman?

759
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:15,824
Oh, why, Niebaum?
You afraid we'll catch you in a lie?

760
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:22,372
When did you find out
Nate was investigating the fund?

761
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:26,668
-Ahem. After I spoke with you.
-That is a fucking lie if l've ever seen one!

762
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:30,881
-Fuck you! I never blinked my eyes!
-You didn't have to blink.

763
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,883
Your body language says you're lying.

764
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:35,427
He's nervous, Danny.
What do you expect?

765
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:38,013
Shut up, Frost!
You know how this works!

766
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:40,682
It's not just your eyes, Niebaum.
It's everything.

767
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:44,228
If you cough, sneeze, uh, cross your legs,
scratch your ass...

768
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:46,563
...they're all telltale signs.
You can't cheat.

769
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:49,983
You can stare at me with those
dead-ass eyes of yours all you want.

770
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:52,110
You can't beat the system.

771
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,445
One last question:

772
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,117
Do you know who killed Nate?

773
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,252
You.

774
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:14,091
I don't know. l couldn't tell.
Up, down, right, left....

775
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,219
So, what now? Card tricks?

776
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,471
Shut the fuck up, Niebaum!

777
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:22,724
You knew Nate was investigating
the fund and you killed him.

778
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:27,354
You could've ended this,
but I guess you don't want to.

779
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:28,981
That's too bad.

780
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:34,152
That's really too bad, Rudy...

781
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,739
...because Danny Roman
was just starting to like you.

782
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:40,117
Well, tell Danny Roman
to hold the fuck on.

783
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:42,953
Danny.

784
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,497
-Danny, you don't wanna do this.
-How do you know?

785
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:50,168
If you think l could kill Nate, how the fuck
do you know I don't wanna do this?

786
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,473
-Yeah?
-Danny Roman?

787
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:05,350
This is Chris Sabian here.

788
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:09,187
Ah, good timing, Chris.
You made it just in time.

789
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:13,692
-Well, I got lucky. Traffic was light.
-Glad you accepted my invitation.

790
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:17,446
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
What's it been, Danny? Two years?

791
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:20,866
Not since both our teams
showed up for that gig on the north side.

792
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:23,201
You pulled rank and ran my boys
out of there.

793
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:26,997
Two negotiators on the same site
never work.

794
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:30,792
So, what's this, then?
The, uh, exception that disproves the rule?

795
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,921
Look, you do your job, I do mine...

796
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:37,007
...maybe we both walk out in one piece.

797
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:44,473
-Here's the million-dollar question.
-Why you?

798
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:46,266
Exactly.

799
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:48,894
I got my reasons.
I don't wanna go into them now.

800
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:51,188
We'll talk about that later.

801
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:54,232
This is our first date, Chris.
The courting period.

802
01:00:55,735 --> 01:01:01,156
So, what do guys like you do
when you're not talking guys like me down?

803
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:07,371
Well, I, uh-- I'm a homebody, Danny.
I spend a lot of time with my family.

804
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:09,873
My, um, kid.

805
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,751
I, uh, read a lot of books.

806
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:15,921
I, um, watch a lot of old movies. AMC.

807
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:18,882
You got a satellite?
They show all those old, uh, Westerns.

808
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,093
Westerns? Heh.

809
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,594
I like comedies, myself.

810
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,389
I did like Shane though.
That's a good one.

811
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:27,724
Uh, Shane. Now, that's a good one...

812
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:31,895
...but, uh, l'd have picked one
where the hero lives at the end, you know?

813
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:35,899
Like, uh, Rio Bravo or Red River.

814
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,276
You're talking
about the wrong movie.

815
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:42,656
Shane lives. At the end of it,
he's riding off and that kid, uh, Brandon--

816
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:43,865
De Wilde.

817
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:47,452
Brandon's De Wilde's calling his name:
"Shane, come back! Shane!"

818
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:51,540
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but Shane died.

819
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,167
You never see Shane dead.
That's an assumption.

820
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:56,128
It's a common mistake.

821
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:59,297
You see, in the final shot,
you see him slumped over his horse.

822
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:02,134
He doesn't look back,
because he's can't. Shane's dead.

823
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:05,137
He's slumped because he's shot.
Slumped don't mean dead.

824
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:07,723
I guess you think that Butch
and Sundance live too...

825
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,934
...even though you never see them dead,
and they're surrounded.

826
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:12,811
So you're some kind of history buff?

827
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,439
Yeah, l generally read histories
and biographies.

828
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:17,482
Well, don't believe everything you read.

829
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:19,985
Well, I didn't say l read just one book.

830
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:23,822
I try to read all the books on a subject.
You know, try to get all the facts...

831
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:26,658
...and then decide for myself
what really happened.

832
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:30,495
Get all the facts.
Yeah, that's smart.

833
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:32,831
You're much better at this than Farley.

834
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:36,126
Before we start to bore everyone,
let's get back to business.

835
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:38,420
First, my list of demands.

836
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:44,176
One: l want my badge
brought down here.

837
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:46,678
Two: lf l die,
I want a departmental funeral.

838
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:48,263
No one's gonna die here.

839
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:50,348
Three: I want the informant found.

840
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:52,267
He's the one
that can clear my name...

841
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:55,228
...and he's the one who knows
who's running this conspiracy.

842
01:02:55,396 --> 01:02:57,939
Four: I wanna know
who killed my partner.

843
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:01,902
Now, if neither the informant or killer
is found in eight hours...

844
01:03:02,069 --> 01:03:05,030
...l will kill one hostage an hour
until they're all dead.

845
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:06,448
Five:

846
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:09,367
I wanna talk to you
face to face now.

847
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:16,041
-Commander's upstairs?
-Yeah, but you can talk to me.

848
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:18,335
-You're the chief?
-Yes. Travis.

849
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:21,505
Nice to meet you. You're Beck?

850
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:22,714
-You're...?
-Farley.

851
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:24,549
-Farley.

852
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,385
All right. Vest.

853
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:30,680
-You're going up there?
-Yes.

854
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:33,517
-Why didn't you talk him down?
-He would have expected it.

855
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:35,727
His sheet, please.

856
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:40,148
-Know why he asked for me?
-We were hoping you could answer that.

857
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:42,400
I can't. Psych evaluation?
Who's on it?

858
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:45,028
-That's Tonray.
-He may actually think he's innocent.

859
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:48,532
We're probably gonna have to go tactical.
We've put a plan together.

860
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:52,536
If we distract him long enough,
we can send in an infiltration team.

861
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:54,996
-Let's wait on that.
-The wife's here.

862
01:03:57,166 --> 01:04:00,627
Oh, God. How is he? Has he hurt anyone?
Who's talking to him?

863
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:03,421
Karen, he's okay.
He asked for Chris Sabian.

864
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:05,924
-Chris Sabian.
-I'm Chris Sabian.

865
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:08,468
-Do you know Danny?
-No.

866
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:12,222
Doesn't matter to you, but he didn't
do those things. You have to help him.

867
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:15,016
I have no idea
about Danny's guilt or innocence.

868
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:18,061
I'm here to get him out safely.
So if you wanna help...

869
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:21,398
...go with Tonray, answer his questions,
and we'll drive you home.

870
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:23,233
No. No, l'm not going home.

871
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:25,777
Mrs. Roman...

872
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:29,865
...you bring tension and emotion to a scene
that already has too much of both.

873
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:32,784
I am not leaving my husband.

874
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:39,124
All right, fine,
but if you wanna help him, help me.

875
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:41,459
I have to get up there.
He wants to talk to me.

876
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:44,963
Go with Tonray, answer his questions
and then stay in case we need you.

877
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:48,466
-That's the best I can do.
-Karen, come with me and talk, okay?

878
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:49,968
It's gonna be all right.

879
01:04:56,517 --> 01:04:57,809
How do l get up?

880
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:00,979
Take the freight elevator to 18.
Walk the rest of the way.

881
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:03,148
I assume you've got all these covered.

882
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:05,233
This is a shaft off lnternal Affairs?

883
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,611
That's access to the steam pipes.
It's unusable.

884
01:05:07,778 --> 01:05:10,989
All right. First, get his badge down there.
Second, shut off the heat.

885
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:14,326
He might deal a hostage to get it back.
What channel we on?

886
01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:18,288
Three. Chief, l wanna
show you something.

887
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:24,920
-Danny, take me.
-Yeah. Yeah. Take him. Come on.

888
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:27,464
I got the asthma. You know?

889
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:32,844
You can't put me in bad situations, man.

890
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:37,307
For chrissakes.
Why you always pick on me?

891
01:05:37,516 --> 01:05:40,101
I mean, who am l? Charlie Brown?

892
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:42,354
You know what Nietzsche says:

893
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:46,608
Even the strongest
have their moments of fatigue.

894
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,860
And I'm fatigued, Danny.

895
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:51,237
I'm fucking fatigued.

896
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:10,507
-You okay?
-Do I look okay?

897
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:13,677
I got a gun pointed at the back of my head.

898
01:06:13,844 --> 01:06:15,178
Nice fucking pants.

899
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:17,847
Shut up, Mr. Blackwell. Get over here.

900
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:23,561
-You working?
-Sort of.

901
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:27,232
I was negotiating a truce
between my wife and daughter.

902
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:29,401
That might prove to be easy
by comparison.

903
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:32,195
It wouldn't surprise me in the least.

904
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:36,324
-So you shut off the heat already.
-You know how this works, Danny.

905
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:37,993
Yeah, l do.

906
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:42,205
Next time you try and bluff,
make sure you charge your cell phone.

907
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:46,292
All right, now, you wanna tell me
what l'm doing up here?

908
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:49,546
l wanted to tell you face to face
I'm not crazy.

909
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:52,090
I'm just doing this to prove my innocence.

910
01:06:52,883 --> 01:06:55,593
I believe you. Anything l can do
to help you get out--

911
01:06:55,761 --> 01:06:57,887
Don't fucking patronize me, man.

912
01:06:58,055 --> 01:07:00,181
You don't think I'm innocent,
so don't tell me:

913
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:02,809
"l wanna do everything I can
to help you get out."

914
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:05,103
Don't talk to me
like l'm some second-rate HT.

915
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:07,439
All right, you're right.
I'm sorry. My mistake.

916
01:07:07,815 --> 01:07:10,692
Yeah, you are sorry. Get out of here.
Lock the door.

917
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,778
-Call when you wanna talk.
-Danny, l'm ready to talk.

918
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:18,616
You're right. You're right.

919
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:21,661
I don't know if you're innocent or not.

920
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:23,580
You could've done everything
they say.

921
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:27,000
You could have killed that cop.
I don't know and l don't care.

922
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:30,295
There are ways to prove your innocence.
This is hardly one of them.

923
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:32,881
And now you got hostages...

924
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:34,799
...so let me tell you this:

925
01:07:34,967 --> 01:07:38,970
You hurt one of them, you burn up whatever
currency you got to deal with me.

926
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:42,891
They're all I care about. You leaving here
walking is a distant second.

927
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:47,353
-Now, do l make myself clear?
-Good.

928
01:07:47,521 --> 01:07:49,064
Now we're getting somewhere.

929
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:53,276
Good, now answer my question.
What am doing I up here?

930
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:56,488
Before Nate was killed, he told me
the men involved in the fraud...

931
01:07:56,655 --> 01:07:59,657
...are from my precinct. Guys l know.

932
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:02,619
-Guys I might call friends.
-And?

933
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:04,370
And you're not.

934
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:06,664
When your friends betray you...

935
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:09,584
...sometimes the only people
you can trust are strangers.

936
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:16,549
Lock the door! Get out! Get out!

937
01:08:16,717 --> 01:08:20,428
Come on! Hurry up. Lock it!
Hurry up! Come on!

938
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:21,805
Hold it right there.

939
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:25,600
Beck. Beck, what happened? l've lost him!
He's gone back in!

940
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:27,685
Come on! Go, go, go!

941
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:30,772
Get up! Get up!

942
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:47,205
Drop the guns! Drop them!

943
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:48,873
Put it down!

944
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:52,210
You are jeopardizing the life
of this hostage!

945
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:54,129
-Drop your gun!
-Drop your weapon!

946
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:56,589
Sniper team, can anyone see Roman?

947
01:08:56,757 --> 01:08:57,799
Look for the one-shot.

948
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,515
We have the target acquired.

949
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:07,809
-Put it down!
-Drop the weapon!

950
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:10,478
-Drop your weapon now!
-Drop it now, Danny!

951
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:12,564
Drop the gun! Drop it!

952
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:15,358
Put it down! Now!

953
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:21,239
Put it down, Danny.

954
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:24,993
-Drop it!
-You're gonna get this man killed!

955
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:28,746
Drop your weapon!

956
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:31,082
Put your gun down!

957
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,835
Tell him! Tell him, Frost!

958
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:36,087
Put the gun down now!

959
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:39,257
Drop your weapon!

960
01:09:41,093 --> 01:09:43,261
Green light. Take the subject out.

961
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:47,098
I can't believe this.

962
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:50,226
Palermo, take the subject out.

963
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:58,193
Palermo, take the subject out!

964
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:01,112
-Copy.
-Don't tell me fucking "copy"!

965
01:10:02,072 --> 01:10:04,407
-Pull the fucking trigger!
-Copy.

966
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:14,125
I cannot take the shot.

967
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,631
Pull the fucking trigger.

968
01:10:19,798 --> 01:10:22,926
-Negative, sir, I cannot take this shot.
-Have a heart!

969
01:10:27,848 --> 01:10:28,890
Fuck!

970
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:31,684
Palermo, bring it in. You're relieved.

971
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:47,659
Kick it!

972
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:56,125
-Looks like the HT's speech worked.
-Stand back.

973
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:58,127
We have this.

974
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:15,770
Is this your command or is it his?

975
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:20,191
You had him distracted.
We saw an opportunity to end this.

976
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:23,152
-We had to take it.
-You put me and those hostages at risk.

977
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:26,322
That's what you did, and that's not
how l work. First, we talk.

978
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:28,533
It was my call.

979
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:32,370
We don't feel this man
can be talked down.

980
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:35,373
Oh, really? I've been here a half-hour!
How do you know that?

981
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:39,627
With all due respect, sir...

982
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:43,047
...l have kept a zero casualty rate
for five years...

983
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,508
...because this kind of action
is a last resort.

984
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:47,385
This is not your command, Sabian.

985
01:11:49,054 --> 01:11:52,056
Yeah, that's right. My command is to get
those people out safely.

986
01:11:52,224 --> 01:11:54,976
-That's my command!
-You don't know this man, lieutenant!

987
01:11:57,479 --> 01:12:00,565
He's manipulating this situation.
Look what he did to Palermo.

988
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:04,402
He's gonna fuck with every single
fucking one of you...

989
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:07,196
...if we give him enough time,
and he knows you'll do it.

990
01:12:07,364 --> 01:12:10,658
-He knows how you fucking work.
-He's got a point, Sabian.

991
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:12,827
We do have a chain of command.

992
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:16,164
Your chain of command
has just given Danny two more hostages.

993
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:21,210
Officers. You gonna take responsibility if
he takes one of them out? Because I don't!

994
01:12:22,212 --> 01:12:25,840
They're just waiting to take this over.
You want that to happen?

995
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:28,134
This is gonna be very easy for you.

996
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:31,429
Roman asked for me
and he's gonna get me.

997
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:33,848
We're gonna do it my way or I walk.

998
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:36,726
I got no truck with leaving you
with this responsibility.

999
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:40,063
Now, it's your decision,
or they're gonna fucking take it over.

1000
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,278
You have command for now.

1001
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:51,449
But l'm still the ranking officer
on the scene...

1002
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:53,451
...and I will be watching.

1003
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:57,455
Good. You watch. Now do me a favor.

1004
01:12:58,207 --> 01:12:59,916
Please introduce me to our team.

1005
01:13:02,419 --> 01:13:03,920
Attention...

1006
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:07,048
...this is your chief, Al Travis.

1007
01:13:07,466 --> 01:13:11,260
I would like to introduce you
to the negotiator, Chris Sabian...

1008
01:13:12,429 --> 01:13:15,807
...who, as of now, has full command.

1009
01:13:19,978 --> 01:13:23,564
My name is Chris Sabian, and as of
right now, all decisions go through me.

1010
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:25,942
No order is valid unless I give it.

1011
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:28,653
No action is taken
unless prior approved by me.

1012
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:31,739
I know we understand each other
and that we'll work together...

1013
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:33,908
...to try to end this safely and quickly.

1014
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:43,292
It didn't work, Beck!
I'm still alive, motherfucker!

1015
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:44,919
Danny, it's Chris.

1016
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:48,673
Danny, Danny, listen to me.
Pick up the radio and talk to me, man.

1017
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:54,846
Stand back. Back. Back.
Move back.

1018
01:14:00,477 --> 01:14:02,437
Nothing! Look!

1019
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:07,442
You guys with the cameras,
you get that?

1020
01:14:07,651 --> 01:14:11,821
All I asked for was more time,
and they tried to take me out!

1021
01:14:12,489 --> 01:14:18,369
It is the policy of the Chicago police
to resolve all hostage situations...

1022
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:22,123
...with the utmost regard
for the preservation of life!

1023
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:24,500
Get his wife. We might need her.

1024
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:34,135
You want my blood?
Take my blood! Come on!

1025
01:14:35,012 --> 01:14:36,721
Here it is! Take it!

1026
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:39,056
Chief, they have a shot.
We can end it here.

1027
01:14:39,224 --> 01:14:42,310
No one takes that shot.
You wanna shoot him on television?

1028
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,645
Move the crowd. I want the area clear.

1029
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:46,856
Go ahead, take my blood!

1030
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:49,233
Go ahead, take the shot!

1031
01:14:49,401 --> 01:14:50,902
Danny!

1032
01:14:51,403 --> 01:14:55,573
I'm getting too close to the truth
and they wanna kill me...

1033
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:57,909
...just like they killed Nate!

1034
01:14:58,076 --> 01:15:00,411
Chief, give me the order.
Give the fucking order!

1035
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:02,538
-Wait.
-Do not take the shot!

1036
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:06,000
What am l gonna have to do
to be heard, huh?

1037
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:09,795
Am I gonna have to hurt somebody
to get respect?

1038
01:15:09,963 --> 01:15:13,674
Well, all right! All right, I will!

1039
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:22,934
Danny, listen to me. Don't do that.
Don't take this to the next level.

1040
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,936
Can he fucking hear me?

1041
01:15:25,103 --> 01:15:26,103
Does he have a radio?

1042
01:15:26,271 --> 01:15:28,523
Think you can come in here
and just shoot me, huh?

1043
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:33,027
They send you to kill me and you just do it?
You just think you can get away with it?

1044
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:35,238
I know you're one of them.
I know you are.

1045
01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:37,782
Now you're gonna fucking pay
for doing that!

1046
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:41,786
Danny. Danny, do not hurt anyone.
Do not do that, all right?

1047
01:15:41,954 --> 01:15:43,287
I am in command here.

1048
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:46,207
No one is gonna breach.
No one is gonna come in.

1049
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:49,919
No one is gonna do anything
without my authority. l'm in control here.

1050
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:54,090
You are not in control! They are!
They're not listening to you, Chris.

1051
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:57,593
So I'm gonna show them
why they should!

1052
01:15:57,761 --> 01:16:00,471
One of the son-of-a-bitches
you sent in is about to die!

1053
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:04,642
And every time you try to come in,
this will happen!

1054
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:07,812
Now move! Move!

1055
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:11,232
Get in there. Get in there!

1056
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,234
Down! Down!

1057
01:16:13,777 --> 01:16:16,654
Are you one of them, Scott?
One of the men that set me up?

1058
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:19,073
Is that why you want me dead?

1059
01:16:20,492 --> 01:16:21,909
It's me, Karen.

1060
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,870
Danny, please talk to me.

1061
01:17:06,705 --> 01:17:08,205
Oh, my God.

1062
01:17:13,211 --> 01:17:18,174
Do not come in here again.

1063
01:17:27,934 --> 01:17:29,560
Karen, I'm sorry.

1064
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:40,905
Cut the electric. Cut it now.

1065
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:45,660
After hours of little action,
we've witnessed a flurry of activity...

1066
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:48,579
...on the 20th floor of the Chicago
administration building.

1067
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:51,540
And it looks like there's a little more action
going on now.

1068
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:53,167
They've cleared the barricades.

1069
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:56,253
Looks like plainclothes--
Actually, those are federal sedans...

1070
01:17:56,421 --> 01:17:59,340
...FBI agents, in fact,
arriving on the scene.

1071
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:02,593
This is a major development for this story,
because up until now...

1072
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:06,389
...this negotiation has been handled
by the Chicago police department.

1073
01:18:06,556 --> 01:18:10,434
With the arrival of the feds, they are either
coming to aid in the negotiation...

1074
01:18:10,602 --> 01:18:14,522
...or perhaps, more likely,
to take over the negotiations.

1075
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:18,567
But that is all speculation. All we know
is that they are now on the scene...

1076
01:18:18,735 --> 01:18:20,361
...and we'll have to wait and see....

1077
01:18:21,988 --> 01:18:23,656
What have you done, Danny?

1078
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:27,535
Danny, you just fucked yourself completely.
You killed a cop!

1079
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:30,538
You killed an innocent man!

1080
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:32,206
He wasn't innocent.

1081
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:35,376
He's one of them. He tried to kill me.

1082
01:18:37,421 --> 01:18:43,259
I told you all when I came in here
I wasn't leaving till I got the truth.

1083
01:18:53,103 --> 01:18:56,147
I don't care how long it takes.

1084
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:00,359
You could've prevented this.

1085
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:06,407
Why don't you just
tell him something, Niebaum?

1086
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,494
Why don't you just fucking
tell him anything?

1087
01:19:11,496 --> 01:19:13,122
Inspector?

1088
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:21,088
Five years, Maggie.

1089
01:19:21,631 --> 01:19:23,174
You must know something.

1090
01:19:24,801 --> 01:19:26,844
-Please, inspector.
-Maggie.

1091
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:30,181
He already lied when he knew it would
cost someone their life.

1092
01:19:30,348 --> 01:19:33,851
Now, if you know something, anything,
you tell me now.

1093
01:19:37,105 --> 01:19:39,356
He keeps all his personal files
on the computer.

1094
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:43,277
I'm not supposed to know about them,
but I do.

1095
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:49,825
There's a lot of stuff on there.
Probably could help you.

1096
01:19:50,994 --> 01:19:52,495
Frost.

1097
01:19:53,038 --> 01:19:55,456
Unlock yourself. Get the computer.

1098
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:57,833
I just saw your troops moving in.

1099
01:19:58,001 --> 01:20:01,462
I don't want a situation where you
and the ATF take over the situation...

1100
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:04,381
...without any fucking evidence whatsoever.
I don't want you going in.

1101
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:08,552
I want a guarantee
before the press starts that l have an hour.

1102
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,095
-Phone's ringing.
-I know.

1103
01:20:10,263 --> 01:20:13,224
-Another hour. l want a guarantee.
-You gonna answer the phone?

1104
01:20:13,391 --> 01:20:15,643
-Yes. Thank you.
-You have one shot.

1105
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:25,569
Are you gonna get that or what?

1106
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:30,908
-Yes.
-Sorry to interrupt. What took you so long?

1107
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:32,409
-I'm busy.
-Busy?

1108
01:20:32,577 --> 01:20:35,913
A piece of advice: Never keep
a hostage-taker waiting. It pisses him off.

1109
01:20:44,047 --> 01:20:46,340
Relax. He'll call back.

1110
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:55,099
Who the fuck
you think you're dealing with--?

1111
01:20:57,102 --> 01:21:00,938
If you have a problem, lieutenant,
maybe you wanna let us handle this.

1112
01:21:01,106 --> 01:21:04,024
Tell him l'm on my way up.
Please, tell him.

1113
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:11,282
-Farley, get the phone.
-Yeah.

1114
01:21:15,787 --> 01:21:17,746
-Sabian--
-No, it's Far--

1115
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:23,752
Danny, Chris is on his way up.

1116
01:21:38,476 --> 01:21:40,644
We need to reopen negotiations.

1117
01:21:41,187 --> 01:21:44,982
-I'm sorry. You want something from me?
-I want the electricity turned back on.

1118
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:47,318
You want something...

1119
01:21:47,819 --> 01:21:49,320
...from me?

1120
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:55,326
You think killing a man
gives you the power to negotiate?

1121
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:59,455
Why is that, Danny Roman?
Because you think you know me?

1122
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:03,208
Because you think you can trust me?

1123
01:22:03,376 --> 01:22:07,004
You think you know what l'm gonna do,
that l'm gonna give you time?

1124
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:08,797
Don't you fucking count on it.

1125
01:22:12,177 --> 01:22:14,178
Right now, l'm the only
thing between you...

1126
01:22:14,346 --> 01:22:17,848
...and an army that's just itching
to walk in here and take you out.

1127
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:22,019
So you tell me something, Danny.
Why should l get in their way, huh?

1128
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:26,148
Make me believe
why I should deal with you...

1129
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:28,108
...ever again.

1130
01:22:29,027 --> 01:22:30,861
I still have hostages.

1131
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:34,198
They can still be punished
for your mistakes.

1132
01:22:34,991 --> 01:22:37,242
What was that, a threat?
Did you just threaten me?

1133
01:22:37,410 --> 01:22:38,869
That's all I need to walk out.

1134
01:22:39,037 --> 01:22:40,996
The rules of engagement state...

1135
01:22:41,247 --> 01:22:45,876
...you don't risk a breach if the
hostage-taker is willing to kill in retaliation.

1136
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:48,379
And I think l've proved
I'm willing to do that.

1137
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:00,891
Things are not what they seem, Chris.

1138
01:23:02,185 --> 01:23:03,894
You saw what they did.

1139
01:23:04,562 --> 01:23:08,565
They didn't tell you they were coming in,
because they want me dead.

1140
01:23:21,621 --> 01:23:23,372
One more gun goes off...

1141
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:26,917
...and I'm gonna give the order
to move in myself. You understand?

1142
01:23:29,045 --> 01:23:32,589
Don't think you've bought anything
by asking me to come here.

1143
01:23:33,258 --> 01:23:37,720
Because you need to remember
I am a stranger to you.

1144
01:23:38,596 --> 01:23:41,515
You have no idea
what l'm capable of.

1145
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:49,690
I need the electricity...

1146
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:53,068
...so I can turn on that computer
and get a look at Niebaum's files.

1147
01:23:53,403 --> 01:23:56,905
I also want food and blankets
for the hostages.

1148
01:23:59,075 --> 01:24:01,702
I'll need a hostage. Nothing less.

1149
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:07,791
Take Frost.

1150
01:24:11,963 --> 01:24:15,424
-Turn the electricity back on.
-Could you repeat that, Sabian?

1151
01:24:16,134 --> 01:24:19,595
I'm about to walk out with a hostage.
Do what l say.

1152
01:24:19,846 --> 01:24:22,222
Turn the electricity back on.

1153
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:11,939
Credit-card fraud and electronic theft.
That's you, right, Rudy?

1154
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:16,527
Well, I got caught for credit-card fraud
and electronic theft...

1155
01:25:16,694 --> 01:25:18,779
...but the list goes on, you know. Heh.

1156
01:25:22,325 --> 01:25:24,993
Look, l could sit here all night
and get nothing.

1157
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:27,621
You know?
What kind of security has this thing got?

1158
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:36,130
F1, enter.

1159
01:25:38,883 --> 01:25:40,342
C...

1160
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:41,885
...dash l dash COM.

1161
01:25:45,515 --> 01:25:47,224
G-9.

1162
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:57,526
-Run a search.
-Well--

1163
01:25:57,694 --> 01:26:00,988
Look for anything that has to do
with the disability fund.

1164
01:26:08,538 --> 01:26:11,248
There's a lot of added security here.

1165
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:16,003
It's not bad.
It's just outdated by six months.

1166
01:26:16,212 --> 01:26:18,839
Mm. Fucking cops.
Always two steps behind.

1167
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:31,685
He's looking for people
to believe in him.

1168
01:26:33,563 --> 01:26:35,689
I don't think l helped the situation.

1169
01:26:36,733 --> 01:26:38,734
Then he shoots Scott.

1170
01:26:45,116 --> 01:26:48,535
Christ. l couldn't do anything.

1171
01:26:52,123 --> 01:26:53,707
Frost.

1172
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:55,834
It would be helpful
if you could tell me...

1173
01:26:56,002 --> 01:27:00,464
...about Danny's relationship to the fund,
his case and specifically, this informant.

1174
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:02,883
Anything you might have overheard
or know...

1175
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:05,886
...that might be of use to me,
that you think is pertinent.

1176
01:27:07,096 --> 01:27:08,263
Sure.

1177
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:13,644
"Disability fund.

1178
01:27:13,811 --> 01:27:16,313
Subdirectories: Wires and taps."

1179
01:27:16,606 --> 01:27:19,149
-Click on wires.
-Okay.

1180
01:27:21,819 --> 01:27:23,487
Oh, man, there's a lot of wires.

1181
01:27:23,655 --> 01:27:26,657
-What are these numbers?
-Cops' badge numbers.

1182
01:27:27,742 --> 01:27:29,159
Okay, now scroll down.

1183
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:33,664
Stop, stop, stop. Back up one.

1184
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:37,501
That's Nate's badge. Okay.

1185
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:41,672
Click that.

1186
01:27:50,682 --> 01:27:52,683
Well, they did do an audit...

1187
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:54,643
...but they didn't prove anything.

1188
01:27:54,811 --> 01:27:56,144
Hey, that's my voice--

1189
01:27:56,813 --> 01:27:59,106
Somebody's taking our money.
We gotta find out who it is.

1190
01:28:00,483 --> 01:28:01,858
Oh, shit!

1191
01:28:03,194 --> 01:28:05,988
You son of a bitch.

1192
01:28:06,698 --> 01:28:08,365
You were tapping Nate.

1193
01:28:08,533 --> 01:28:11,451
You knew he was
investigating the fraud.

1194
01:28:11,619 --> 01:28:14,371
-You lied.
-Fuck you!

1195
01:28:14,539 --> 01:28:17,207
And then you killed him
because he was getting too close.

1196
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:20,502
Tap a lot of cops. There's only one killer
in this room.

1197
01:28:21,629 --> 01:28:23,213
I'm not the killer here, you are.

1198
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:27,801
Scroll back to October 12th,
the night before Nate was killed.

1199
01:28:29,887 --> 01:28:32,014
-There's only one recording.
-Click on it!

1200
01:28:32,181 --> 01:28:33,682
All right, all right.

1201
01:28:35,018 --> 01:28:36,852
Are you gonna talk to me?

1202
01:28:37,729 --> 01:28:40,605
It's that case I'm working on. It's, uh....

1203
01:28:44,610 --> 01:28:47,321
Look, I'll just be a minute.
Sorry, honey. I won't be long.

1204
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:50,449
I just wanna see if he's here, you know?

1205
01:28:50,616 --> 01:28:53,744
I don't wanna talk to him on the phone.
It's just not....

1206
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:58,707
I'll see you soon, okay?
I'll just be a minute.

1207
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:02,919
-Okay.
-Okay?

1208
01:29:03,087 --> 01:29:05,922
-I love you.
-I love you too.

1209
01:29:07,675 --> 01:29:09,551
He was going to see his informant,
wasn't he?

1210
01:29:09,719 --> 01:29:12,262
Ha-ha-ha. You don't know
what you're talking about.

1211
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:16,600
The night before Nate was killed he told me
he had just talked to his informant.

1212
01:29:16,768 --> 01:29:18,268
Yeah, yeah.

1213
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:20,937
You knew that too.

1214
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:26,401
What's going on here, Niebaum?

1215
01:29:26,569 --> 01:29:29,279
Why can't you find this guy, huh?

1216
01:29:29,447 --> 01:29:33,450
You gotta be looking for him
so you can shut him up too!

1217
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:39,664
You don't know who he is, do you?

1218
01:29:40,458 --> 01:29:43,335
Linda wouldn't tell you where they went
that night, would she?

1219
01:29:43,544 --> 01:29:46,713
Because she thinks you're
as guilty as l am.

1220
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:04,106
-Go ahead.
-Is this a private line?

1221
01:30:04,315 --> 01:30:06,441
-You need it to be?
-Yeah.

1222
01:30:09,195 --> 01:30:10,320
Sorry.

1223
01:30:10,988 --> 01:30:11,988
Go ahead.

1224
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:15,826
I need you to talk to Linda Roenick,
Nate's wife.

1225
01:30:15,993 --> 01:30:17,327
About what?

1226
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:22,290
I found some taps that prove
Niebaum's been lying all along.

1227
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:25,627
I heard something on one of them.
I need you to ask Linda about it.

1228
01:30:25,795 --> 01:30:27,337
You and only you.

1229
01:30:28,631 --> 01:30:30,090
What do you want me to ask her?

1230
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:34,010
Ask her where she and Nate went
on October 12th, the night before he died.

1231
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:35,470
Who he talked to.

1232
01:30:36,347 --> 01:30:40,475
If she tells you who he saw,
I'll give you another hostage.

1233
01:30:40,643 --> 01:30:43,603
If she tells you nothing, you get nothing.

1234
01:30:44,147 --> 01:30:46,398
Have my hostage ready.

1235
01:30:51,988 --> 01:30:53,363
Yes.

1236
01:30:54,490 --> 01:30:55,699
Yes.

1237
01:30:56,033 --> 01:30:58,994
Great. All right.

1238
01:30:59,162 --> 01:31:00,871
-Excuse me.
-I gotta go.

1239
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:02,747
-Can we have a word?
-Yes.

1240
01:31:02,915 --> 01:31:06,877
Hellman's been studying the blueprints
with Beck. They have a suggestion.

1241
01:31:07,044 --> 01:31:08,378
You do take suggestions?

1242
01:31:10,882 --> 01:31:14,759
Hellman thinks we can get a team
in the vent system right above Roman.

1243
01:31:14,927 --> 01:31:19,514
What we're suggesting is getting men
in place for a crisis entry. Just one unit.

1244
01:31:19,682 --> 01:31:20,807
Only as a precaution.

1245
01:31:20,975 --> 01:31:24,519
With this type of entry, we can control him
in case he starts shooting hostages.

1246
01:31:25,563 --> 01:31:29,566
We can go in there strong,
two, three seconds from bang to bullets.

1247
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:31,818
Sabian, we're not asking
for a full breach.

1248
01:31:31,986 --> 01:31:34,237
We have a real concern
he may kill one of our men.

1249
01:31:34,405 --> 01:31:38,200
That may not mean much to you,
but it means a hell of a lot to us.

1250
01:31:38,367 --> 01:31:39,618
Beck, please.

1251
01:31:39,785 --> 01:31:42,287
Chris, l just wanna be ready to go
if we need to.

1252
01:31:42,455 --> 01:31:46,333
I agree with the commander's assessment,
and l do care if our team is injured...

1253
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:49,252
...but they don't move an inch,
no matter what Danny does...

1254
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:51,046
...without my authorization.

1255
01:31:51,214 --> 01:31:54,341
-Gentlemen?
-Without a doubt.

1256
01:31:57,929 --> 01:31:59,763
Sabian.

1257
01:32:20,952 --> 01:32:26,164
Allen, we're gonna make an opportunity.
We'll take him out if we get the shot.

1258
01:32:26,332 --> 01:32:28,041
Right.

1259
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:36,049
How you holding up?

1260
01:32:36,717 --> 01:32:38,134
Good.

1261
01:32:38,302 --> 01:32:40,303
Why don't you take a little break?

1262
01:32:43,474 --> 01:32:46,476
I'm gonna get us inside.
We're gonna end this thing.

1263
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:49,062
Let's do it.

1264
01:32:53,818 --> 01:32:56,236
-Anybody gotta use the bathroom?
-Yes, l do.

1265
01:32:56,404 --> 01:32:58,029
Me too.

1266
01:33:02,994 --> 01:33:04,369
Where is it, Maggie?

1267
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:07,080
There's one across the street
in a nice restaurant...

1268
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:09,666
...but l'm sure that's probably out
of the question.

1269
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:13,128
You can use that one
if you can hold it till we get out of here.

1270
01:33:14,589 --> 01:33:16,298
There's one down the hall.

1271
01:33:18,634 --> 01:33:19,843
Thank you.

1272
01:33:24,890 --> 01:33:27,017
When she's gone, use this.

1273
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:37,360
You bet, we need to contain
the building. I need teams on 19...

1274
01:33:37,528 --> 01:33:39,112
...20 and 21.

1275
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:41,156
-Yes, sir.
-And secure the lobby.

1276
01:33:41,324 --> 01:33:43,033
Yes, sir.

1277
01:33:47,622 --> 01:33:50,081
-What the hell is Sabian doing up there?
-No idea.

1278
01:33:50,249 --> 01:33:53,793
Guy came in about an hour ago.
They've been talking ever since.

1279
01:34:11,437 --> 01:34:13,688
Why the hell is this taking so long?

1280
01:34:13,856 --> 01:34:17,651
They're trying to wear down Danny
so he gets tired.

1281
01:34:19,403 --> 01:34:23,073
Why the hell do you have all these cops
and their accounts in here, Niebaum?

1282
01:34:24,408 --> 01:34:27,702
Why are you investigating a fraud
that you're part of?

1283
01:34:27,995 --> 01:34:30,080
I'm not part of any fraud.

1284
01:34:32,541 --> 01:34:36,419
Did you out find these cops were skimming
from the fund and you blackmailed them?

1285
01:34:37,046 --> 01:34:38,713
Is that how it works?

1286
01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:42,592
Why these cops? These guys
don't have access to the money.

1287
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:45,720
Well, it's basically insurance fraud, right?

1288
01:34:46,389 --> 01:34:48,765
-What?
-It's--

1289
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:50,600
Somebody--

1290
01:34:50,768 --> 01:34:54,771
Some of these guys on this list
submit false claims.

1291
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:59,609
It's like this auto-body thing I pulled--
I mean, some guy I know....

1292
01:35:00,069 --> 01:35:04,823
He would tell the insurance company
his car had been wrecked, right?

1293
01:35:04,990 --> 01:35:07,492
-It's very simple.
-And then?

1294
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:11,705
Well, he'd never get paid
if the claims agent wasn't in on it.

1295
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:15,792
So you need somebody with access to put
the paperwork through, then cover it up.

1296
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,293
Bingo.

1297
01:35:20,881 --> 01:35:22,966
That's where you come in.

1298
01:35:23,134 --> 01:35:25,009
Isn't it, Roman?

1299
01:35:30,391 --> 01:35:32,809
All right, what is this, Sabian?
Who is this?

1300
01:35:33,811 --> 01:35:35,562
You're about to find out.

1301
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:52,662
-Danny?
-You talk to Linda?

1302
01:35:52,830 --> 01:35:55,498
I've done one better.
I found your informant.

1303
01:35:55,666 --> 01:35:58,668
You're gonna end up giving me
all my hostages.

1304
01:36:03,132 --> 01:36:04,841
Sergeant Cale Wangro.

1305
01:36:07,011 --> 01:36:08,178
He knows who's involved.

1306
01:36:08,471 --> 01:36:11,014
He was afraid to come forward
after Nathan was killed...

1307
01:36:11,182 --> 01:36:13,516
...and he wasn't sure whether
you were involved.

1308
01:36:13,684 --> 01:36:14,726
Well, who was it?

1309
01:36:14,894 --> 01:36:18,688
Listen, Danny.
This is gonna implicate too many people.

1310
01:36:18,856 --> 01:36:23,026
So the FBl is here. They're ready
to take his statement to ensure impartiality.

1311
01:36:23,486 --> 01:36:26,946
But l cannot have this go over the air,
all right, so it's over, Danny.

1312
01:36:27,114 --> 01:36:29,365
It's done. Come on out.

1313
01:36:29,950 --> 01:36:32,494
-Get my wife in there.
-Get his wife.

1314
01:36:36,165 --> 01:36:38,541
-They found the informant.
-Oh, thank God!

1315
01:36:38,709 --> 01:36:41,211
Yes! Thank God!

1316
01:36:41,378 --> 01:36:43,713
Congratulations, Maggie.
You are free to go.

1317
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:49,219
Inspector, fuck you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1318
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:54,140
Let my people go, man!
Come on, man. Give it up.

1319
01:36:56,352 --> 01:36:57,560
Chris, hold on a second.

1320
01:37:00,356 --> 01:37:04,067
We were at the academy.
We worked at Area 6 together.

1321
01:37:04,985 --> 01:37:07,695
Chris, put Nate's informant on.

1322
01:37:07,863 --> 01:37:09,572
Danny, I don't want this broadcast.

1323
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:12,659
Look, if he can clear my name,
I wanna talk to him, now.

1324
01:37:24,255 --> 01:37:25,547
Danny, this is Cale.

1325
01:37:25,714 --> 01:37:29,050
Hi, Cale. Very brave of you
to come down like this.

1326
01:37:29,802 --> 01:37:31,427
You know
I have a lot of questions.

1327
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:35,265
Let's just start
with, uh, who was involved...

1328
01:37:35,432 --> 01:37:37,600
...in this conspiracy, for 500, Cale.

1329
01:37:37,768 --> 01:37:41,354
I can't name names,
not in front of everyone here.

1330
01:37:41,522 --> 01:37:44,899
-Wouldn't be, uh, appropriate.
-I don't wanna hear about appropriate.

1331
01:37:45,401 --> 01:37:47,861
Just tell me who was involved.
Now, who was it?

1332
01:37:48,362 --> 01:37:50,113
Men you know, Danny.

1333
01:37:51,115 --> 01:37:52,282
There may be others...

1334
01:37:55,578 --> 01:37:58,621
...but l only know the names of
the key players.

1335
01:38:00,791 --> 01:38:02,709
Don't make me say their names.

1336
01:38:08,424 --> 01:38:09,883
Why didn't you go see Niebaum?

1337
01:38:10,050 --> 01:38:14,304
I didn't know if Niebaum
was getting paid off to be quiet or not.

1338
01:38:14,471 --> 01:38:17,891
I couldn't trust him or Internal Affairs.

1339
01:38:18,142 --> 01:38:22,645
-I did hear his name mentioned.
-So Niebaum was definitely involved.

1340
01:38:25,399 --> 01:38:27,233
Thanks, Cale.

1341
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:28,943
Now, how did you know Nate?

1342
01:38:30,654 --> 01:38:31,905
From the academy.

1343
01:38:33,616 --> 01:38:34,991
How long you been on the job?

1344
01:38:35,618 --> 01:38:39,287
-Since '74. Why?
-When's the last time you met with Nate?

1345
01:38:40,497 --> 01:38:42,582
The night before he died.

1346
01:38:44,501 --> 01:38:45,752
Good.

1347
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:48,338
Now we're getting somewhere.

1348
01:38:50,382 --> 01:38:51,674
Dan.

1349
01:38:55,512 --> 01:38:56,679
Hold on, Cale.

1350
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:30,964
Sorry, um....

1351
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:36,135
So Nate tells me, uh, you played ball
with him at Colorado State, that right?

1352
01:39:36,887 --> 01:39:39,222
Yeah, but what's this
have to do with anything?

1353
01:39:39,682 --> 01:39:41,891
Well, he went to Arizona State, Cale.

1354
01:39:46,397 --> 01:39:47,522
Put Chris on the phone.

1355
01:39:58,534 --> 01:40:01,494
Nice try, Sabian.
Your little bluff didn't work.

1356
01:40:04,081 --> 01:40:09,419
Niebaum told me Nate was his informant.
See, he worked for lAD.

1357
01:40:09,586 --> 01:40:12,213
Worked for Niebaum all along.
He was describing himself.

1358
01:40:12,381 --> 01:40:13,673
Just didn't want me to know.

1359
01:40:13,841 --> 01:40:17,260
Now, Niebaum says he was not
part of the murder.

1360
01:40:17,428 --> 01:40:19,095
What's going on here, Sabian?

1361
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:22,515
-He's using our bluff against Niebaum.
-He's willing to testify.

1362
01:40:22,683 --> 01:40:26,394
He'll name names if you grant him immunity
on the murder charge.

1363
01:40:26,562 --> 01:40:29,439
You call me back if we have a deal.

1364
01:40:31,692 --> 01:40:32,734
Danny, talk--

1365
01:40:34,862 --> 01:40:36,195
We've been made.

1366
01:40:37,239 --> 01:40:40,283
What are you doing? l didn't make a deal.
What the fuck are you doing?

1367
01:40:40,451 --> 01:40:42,118
They think you did, Niebaum.

1368
01:40:42,703 --> 01:40:46,581
But there is no "they," right?
So you don't shit have to worry about.

1369
01:40:50,586 --> 01:40:52,545
This was a bluff?

1370
01:40:53,589 --> 01:40:56,924
-That all depends on your position.
-Did you know about this, Frost?

1371
01:40:57,092 --> 01:40:59,552
No. No, l didn't.

1372
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:02,638
I told him what I knew
about Nathan's informant.

1373
01:41:03,223 --> 01:41:05,558
This is how you use that information?

1374
01:41:06,268 --> 01:41:08,478
Making us think he's innocent
after all those--

1375
01:41:08,645 --> 01:41:10,438
Who the fuck do you think you are?

1376
01:41:10,606 --> 01:41:13,566
I can use information any way I want
to try to end this.

1377
01:41:13,734 --> 01:41:16,652
I don't know who's innocent.
That's what I'm trying to find out.

1378
01:41:17,237 --> 01:41:20,656
Don't call me in here
to be part of your charades again.

1379
01:41:21,825 --> 01:41:23,326
Karen, you--

1380
01:41:23,494 --> 01:41:25,328
Get him back.

1381
01:41:29,917 --> 01:41:33,086
Karen.

1382
01:41:33,670 --> 01:41:36,798
Karen, right now,
understand I don't know who to trust.

1383
01:41:37,966 --> 01:41:39,967
Up there or in there.

1384
01:41:40,928 --> 01:41:43,179
The bluff wasn't just for Danny.

1385
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:50,645
Move, Rudy.

1386
01:41:50,813 --> 01:41:51,938
Move!

1387
01:42:02,199 --> 01:42:03,699
Who killed Nate?

1388
01:42:05,994 --> 01:42:08,871
They killed Nate, Niebaum.
Think they won't kill you?

1389
01:42:16,088 --> 01:42:17,922
Fuck it.

1390
01:42:21,051 --> 01:42:22,552
Fuck are you doing?

1391
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:24,387
Where are you taking me? No!

1392
01:42:24,888 --> 01:42:26,097
I know nothing!

1393
01:42:26,265 --> 01:42:28,474
They're gonna take me out
because you set me up!

1394
01:42:28,684 --> 01:42:31,394
You'll get another innocent man killed!
I know nothing!

1395
01:42:32,187 --> 01:42:34,230
Don't put me in that fucking room!

1396
01:42:37,401 --> 01:42:38,568
Okay, okay!

1397
01:42:38,735 --> 01:42:40,153
Don't put me in that room!

1398
01:42:43,407 --> 01:42:45,950
Nate. Nate came to me with taps.

1399
01:42:46,118 --> 01:42:48,661
I went to the guys who were implicated
in the taps.

1400
01:42:48,829 --> 01:42:52,498
They offered me money to lose
the evidence. l did it.

1401
01:42:52,666 --> 01:42:55,084
Okay? It was a one-time deal!

1402
01:42:55,752 --> 01:42:58,588
They offered the same thing to Nate.
They killed him.

1403
01:42:58,755 --> 01:43:01,340
-Who's on the taps?
-Get me out of this fucking--

1404
01:43:01,508 --> 01:43:03,885
-Who's on the fucking taps?
-All your friends!

1405
01:43:04,052 --> 01:43:05,261
Who?

1406
01:43:05,429 --> 01:43:06,888
Argento...

1407
01:43:07,055 --> 01:43:08,598
...Hellman, Allen. Yeah.

1408
01:43:08,765 --> 01:43:10,183
-That's bullshit!
-No.

1409
01:43:10,350 --> 01:43:12,435
I have proof! I have them on taps...

1410
01:43:13,103 --> 01:43:16,105
...talking about how they took money
out of the fund.

1411
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:18,941
They couldn't do that themselves.
Who's in charge?

1412
01:43:19,109 --> 01:43:20,568
I don't know.

1413
01:43:21,111 --> 01:43:23,362
-Are those taps on this computer?
-No.

1414
01:43:23,530 --> 01:43:24,572
Where are they?

1415
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:26,991
I have them somewhere safe!

1416
01:43:28,452 --> 01:43:31,787
Air Tac 1,
civilian unit approaching. Peel away.

1417
01:43:35,584 --> 01:43:38,377
You are flying
in a government crime-scene airspace.

1418
01:43:38,545 --> 01:43:41,756
It is imperative you respect
the two-mile boundary law.

1419
01:43:41,965 --> 01:43:43,799
Turn away from the building.

1420
01:43:43,967 --> 01:43:47,303
I repeat, turn away from the building.

1421
01:44:01,443 --> 01:44:04,278
-Who's firing?
-Down! Down! Everyone down!

1422
01:44:05,239 --> 01:44:07,156
Who the hell just fired?

1423
01:44:09,576 --> 01:44:12,912
-Initiate breach.
-No, no, no! Do not breach!

1424
01:44:15,999 --> 01:44:18,334
Let me through!
Let me through!

1425
01:44:18,502 --> 01:44:21,003
Team's position has been compromised.
Unit 1, status?

1426
01:44:21,171 --> 01:44:23,339
-Send in Unit 1.
-Kill the lights, Unit 1.

1427
01:44:46,363 --> 01:44:48,364
Unit 1, give me status.

1428
01:44:48,532 --> 01:44:49,865
Unit 1, we're coming in.

1429
01:44:56,206 --> 01:44:57,540
Fuck!

1430
01:45:02,879 --> 01:45:04,046
Move!

1431
01:45:08,802 --> 01:45:10,678
He's got flashbangs!

1432
01:45:11,847 --> 01:45:13,723
Move! Move!

1433
01:45:21,398 --> 01:45:23,232
Fuck!

1434
01:45:24,359 --> 01:45:26,235
Get down!

1435
01:45:32,117 --> 01:45:33,367
Take him out.

1436
01:45:33,535 --> 01:45:34,952
Take the subject out.

1437
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:36,162
Do not fire!

1438
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:38,831
Do not! l did not give the order!
Do not!

1439
01:45:45,339 --> 01:45:47,214
Terminate this breach.

1440
01:46:21,750 --> 01:46:22,917
Danny, can you hear me?

1441
01:46:27,589 --> 01:46:29,715
Maggie, you okay?

1442
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:31,133
Rudy? Markus?

1443
01:46:35,472 --> 01:46:37,223
Oh, shit. Shit!

1444
01:46:37,724 --> 01:46:38,766
They shot him.

1445
01:46:40,644 --> 01:46:42,895
Hold on, inspector. Just hold on.

1446
01:46:43,063 --> 01:46:45,439
I'll get somebody up here to help you.

1447
01:46:45,607 --> 01:46:46,649
Come on.

1448
01:46:47,275 --> 01:46:48,818
Danny, can you hear me?

1449
01:46:49,444 --> 01:46:51,612
Danny, is anyone else hurt up there?

1450
01:46:51,822 --> 01:46:53,823
Come on, come on. Down.

1451
01:46:54,241 --> 01:46:55,991
Danny, is anyone hurt up there?

1452
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:01,747
Come on. Hold on.

1453
01:47:01,998 --> 01:47:03,958
I'm gonna get somebody. Come on.

1454
01:47:08,213 --> 01:47:10,172
Get somebody up here! Niebaum's been--

1455
01:47:12,175 --> 01:47:13,634
Oh, God.

1456
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:24,854
He's dead!

1457
01:47:26,356 --> 01:47:29,191
You hear that, Chris? They killed him.

1458
01:47:29,359 --> 01:47:31,485
Holy Jesus.

1459
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:37,032
Danny, are you shot?

1460
01:47:44,749 --> 01:47:47,001
Danny, is anyone hurt up there?

1461
01:47:47,836 --> 01:47:50,045
Anyone else hurt up there?

1462
01:47:53,175 --> 01:47:56,510
What the hell happened? I step out
of this room and someone gets killed?

1463
01:47:56,678 --> 01:47:59,096
It was an accident.
What did you expect my men to do?

1464
01:47:59,264 --> 01:48:01,223
A gun went off. Any idea who shot first?

1465
01:48:01,391 --> 01:48:05,394
What the fuck are you accusing us of?
My men responded to a situation!

1466
01:48:05,562 --> 01:48:07,938
If a firecracker goes off,
you respond the same way?

1467
01:48:08,106 --> 01:48:10,399
We don't know what happened.
What did we agree to?

1468
01:48:10,567 --> 01:48:13,861
That no matter what, no one goes in
without my authority.

1469
01:48:14,029 --> 01:48:15,738
That's what we agreed on.

1470
01:48:15,906 --> 01:48:19,158
You got no eyes, you got no ears,
you got nothing but assumptions!

1471
01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:22,703
I called for the breach. lt was conducted
with my authority.

1472
01:48:22,871 --> 01:48:23,996
Not anymore.

1473
01:48:26,082 --> 01:48:29,752
We're taking over. FBl cannot
stand by and let this situation continue.

1474
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:33,422
-Don't take me off. Listen to me.
-We're asking you to leave, lieutenant.

1475
01:48:33,590 --> 01:48:36,217
All right, l bluffed him,
but he knows what l was doing.

1476
01:48:36,384 --> 01:48:37,676
We need to rotate your men--

1477
01:48:37,844 --> 01:48:40,554
He thinks someone
just tried to kill him!

1478
01:48:40,722 --> 01:48:42,223
We're going in. Full breach.

1479
01:48:42,682 --> 01:48:45,226
Don't do it. Listen.
You breach, everyone's gonna die.

1480
01:48:45,393 --> 01:48:47,269
Understand that? Everyone's gonna die.

1481
01:48:47,437 --> 01:48:50,397
Maybe that's what some of you
wanna have happen, but I don't!

1482
01:48:50,565 --> 01:48:54,068
I was brought here to save this man's life
and bring him out, all right?

1483
01:48:54,236 --> 01:48:56,445
There's no reason
to jeopardize hostages.

1484
01:48:56,613 --> 01:48:57,947
Shut up!

1485
01:48:59,950 --> 01:49:03,744
Agent Moran, this is a mistake.
You wanna change negotiators, fine.

1486
01:49:03,912 --> 01:49:06,580
But you give Roman a 30-second
window of opportunity...

1487
01:49:06,748 --> 01:49:08,207
...he'll exploit it.

1488
01:49:09,459 --> 01:49:12,253
We gotta keep him locked down.
My men can handle it.

1489
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:14,838
We've seen what your men can handle.

1490
01:49:15,006 --> 01:49:16,048
Please.

1491
01:49:16,216 --> 01:49:18,717
Your men stay in place.
Our men will support yours...

1492
01:49:18,885 --> 01:49:22,137
-...but you'll execute orders that we give.
-You're off, Sabian.

1493
01:49:23,139 --> 01:49:26,976
I can't believe this. I'm just surrounded
by people who wanna go in and kill him.

1494
01:49:27,143 --> 01:49:31,397
This is the guy you called your friend.
I got nothing invested in this!

1495
01:49:32,607 --> 01:49:34,650
I wonder why that is!

1496
01:49:36,611 --> 01:49:38,320
Maybe someday we'll find out.

1497
01:49:38,488 --> 01:49:40,406
No more negotiating.

1498
01:49:41,074 --> 01:49:43,951
Would you please escort Mr. Sabian
to his car?

1499
01:49:44,869 --> 01:49:45,953
Lieutenant.

1500
01:49:46,663 --> 01:49:47,955
This way, sir.

1501
01:49:48,665 --> 01:49:50,874
Dying to go up.
You call yourselves his friends.

1502
01:49:51,042 --> 01:49:54,169
Danny Roman,
this is Agent Grey of the FBl.

1503
01:49:54,588 --> 01:49:57,673
Chris Sabian has been relieved
of his command and I'm in charge.

1504
01:49:59,259 --> 01:50:02,553
As of this moment,
all negotiations are suspended.

1505
01:50:02,721 --> 01:50:05,014
You have five minutes to surrender...

1506
01:50:05,181 --> 01:50:07,016
...or we're coming in after you.

1507
01:50:18,987 --> 01:50:21,822
Oh, Christ. Sabian's going in.

1508
01:50:23,491 --> 01:50:25,826
Danny, it's me. I'm on my way up.

1509
01:50:29,039 --> 01:50:32,958
Danny, this wasn't your fault.
We all heard him confess. He was guilty.

1510
01:50:33,918 --> 01:50:35,169
Yeah.

1511
01:50:36,296 --> 01:50:38,172
Well, what's it matter, Maggie?

1512
01:50:39,007 --> 01:50:41,550
Nate's dead. Niebaum's dead.

1513
01:50:42,469 --> 01:50:43,510
Computer's dead.

1514
01:50:44,054 --> 01:50:48,432
And, look, Sabian is coming upstairs now.

1515
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:50,684
You have to tell him what Niebaum said.

1516
01:50:51,353 --> 01:50:55,397
What, you gonna give up now?
Come on, that'd be a crime, man.

1517
01:51:02,364 --> 01:51:04,198
Listen, all of you...

1518
01:51:05,742 --> 01:51:07,743
...l'm sorry l got you into this.

1519
01:51:08,703 --> 01:51:10,537
This'll all be over soon.

1520
01:51:11,915 --> 01:51:15,668
-Danny, pick up the phone
or we will be forced to come in.

1521
01:51:17,087 --> 01:51:20,673
Maggie, would you tell my wife
something for me?

1522
01:51:22,342 --> 01:51:24,593
Just tell her l was trying
to keep my promise.

1523
01:51:32,977 --> 01:51:34,269
Hey, Danny.

1524
01:51:34,437 --> 01:51:38,190
You know, Niebaum worked at home
just about as much as he worked here.

1525
01:51:40,276 --> 01:51:42,778
He could've kept
Nathan's taps there.

1526
01:51:55,458 --> 01:51:56,959
You alone?

1527
01:51:58,628 --> 01:52:01,797
You gotta surrender now.
I can't hold them back. They're coming up.

1528
01:52:01,965 --> 01:52:05,217
I'm getting too close, Chris.
I know what went down now.

1529
01:52:05,468 --> 01:52:08,303
Niebaum told me Hellman, Allen
and Argento are involved.

1530
01:52:08,471 --> 01:52:11,473
-You got no proof.
-He does. Niebaum confessed. We all heard.

1531
01:52:11,641 --> 01:52:15,269
They're shooting us one by one
and you fuckers aren't helping us.

1532
01:52:15,437 --> 01:52:19,481
-Are you gonna help us or what?
-Who called for the breach? Beck?

1533
01:52:19,649 --> 01:52:22,484
Yeah, but he says you fired first
and Niebaum was an accident.

1534
01:52:22,652 --> 01:52:24,737
Niebaum was no accident.
He was assassinated.

1535
01:52:24,904 --> 01:52:28,073
He's got three bullets,
center mass. Look.

1536
01:52:39,669 --> 01:52:43,255
Come on, Chris.
You gotta admit something's going on.

1537
01:52:43,423 --> 01:52:46,341
It doesn't matter.
Two cops are dead and you killed one.

1538
01:52:46,509 --> 01:52:50,512
I need to get you and these hostages out
of here before they come in.

1539
01:52:58,480 --> 01:52:59,521
Let's end this, Danny!

1540
01:53:15,205 --> 01:53:18,081
They had to believe l was capable of that.

1541
01:53:18,374 --> 01:53:22,127
There's only one dead cop up here,
killed by the men who tried to set me up.

1542
01:53:23,296 --> 01:53:26,006
Now, I know Nate tapped Hellman
and the others.

1543
01:53:26,174 --> 01:53:29,551
I think those taps are at Niebaum's.
If l get there, I can end this.

1544
01:53:29,719 --> 01:53:33,222
They're gonna kill you. Understand?
You got no way out unless you surrender.

1545
01:53:33,389 --> 01:53:35,641
You gave me a way out
when you shut the heat off.

1546
01:53:35,809 --> 01:53:38,727
Now, you know there's another way
you can help me.

1547
01:53:39,103 --> 01:53:40,687
You were wrong about me.

1548
01:53:42,398 --> 01:53:44,483
What if I'm right about them?

1549
01:53:47,028 --> 01:53:49,363
But what if you're wrong about me?

1550
01:54:04,003 --> 01:54:07,673
Maggie. Uncuff yourself.
Get in the conference room.

1551
01:54:11,261 --> 01:54:12,845
Shit.

1552
01:54:15,056 --> 01:54:18,684
Initiate full breach. Shoot on sight.

1553
01:54:41,958 --> 01:54:44,293
Come on, Rudy. Move, move!

1554
01:55:32,926 --> 01:55:35,093
Here, Maggie, use this.

1555
01:55:35,595 --> 01:55:39,014
Markus, split this between
you and Rudy. Wet it.

1556
01:55:40,183 --> 01:55:43,352
You know the drill.
There's gonna be a lot of gas and smoke.

1557
01:55:44,145 --> 01:55:46,021
Let me have those keys.

1558
01:56:00,995 --> 01:56:04,206
Don't be scared.
They're coming to save you in a minute.

1559
01:56:04,374 --> 01:56:05,666
Close the door.

1560
01:56:05,833 --> 01:56:08,293
Down, down, down.
On the ground, now.

1561
01:56:59,762 --> 01:57:01,388
-Move.
-Move now.

1562
01:57:04,851 --> 01:57:06,560
Look out!

1563
01:57:19,574 --> 01:57:21,241
Double up, now! Now, now, now!

1564
01:57:51,981 --> 01:57:54,775
Found the hostages. No sign of Roman.

1565
01:57:54,942 --> 01:57:58,153
Check the elevator shaft,
check every vent, check the basement.

1566
01:57:58,321 --> 01:58:00,906
Come on, get up.
Let's go. Let's go!

1567
01:58:04,744 --> 01:58:06,161
We found Scott.

1568
01:58:07,121 --> 01:58:08,622
He's alive.

1569
01:58:34,524 --> 01:58:38,193
You wanna prove your innocence,
here's your chance.

1570
01:58:38,528 --> 01:58:40,654
But you make one wrong move...

1571
01:58:40,822 --> 01:58:45,283
...and I'm gonna take you down myself.
Understand?

1572
01:58:48,371 --> 01:58:52,207
All right, you wanna get out of here?
Follow me.

1573
01:58:55,169 --> 01:58:57,546
If he's in here, we'll find him.

1574
01:58:57,880 --> 01:58:59,131
He's not.

1575
01:59:01,425 --> 01:59:02,551
He's gone mobile.

1576
01:59:04,846 --> 01:59:09,182
This is Commander Beck.
I am now back in charge of this operation.

1577
01:59:09,350 --> 01:59:10,392
What are you doing?

1578
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:13,562
If he's out of the building,
he's no longer in your jurisdiction.

1579
01:59:16,816 --> 01:59:17,941
Dispatch.

1580
01:59:18,192 --> 01:59:21,862
Suspect may have left the scene,
possibly on foot. Alert all units.

1581
01:59:22,363 --> 01:59:24,239
Alerting all units.

1582
01:59:44,760 --> 01:59:47,596
Sorry, lieutenant.
Can we check the trunk?

1583
02:00:33,643 --> 02:00:35,518
Just keep them back there!

1584
02:01:03,422 --> 02:01:07,634
I don't know what the fuck was going on.
A lot of shit happened out there.

1585
02:01:07,802 --> 02:01:09,844
You must have some idea.

1586
02:01:10,137 --> 02:01:14,015
You know something? I would really
like to help, but my lips are sealed.

1587
02:01:14,267 --> 02:01:16,601
Frankly, I don't trust any of you
fucking guys.

1588
02:01:16,811 --> 02:01:20,272
-I'm very disappointed in all of you.
-Maggie.

1589
02:01:20,439 --> 02:01:24,109
You gotta help us out here.
I know what you're feeling.

1590
02:01:24,277 --> 02:01:25,902
I know you sympathize with Danny...

1591
02:01:26,070 --> 02:01:30,115
...but we need to stop him
before he does something dangerous.

1592
02:01:30,533 --> 02:01:33,159
You don't want anyone else hurt, do you?

1593
02:01:33,703 --> 02:01:38,039
You know something, you don't tell us,
that's obstruction of justice.

1594
02:01:38,207 --> 02:01:40,166
Wanna go to jail?

1595
02:01:45,047 --> 02:01:46,631
He went to Niebaum's house.

1596
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:52,721
Why did he go there?

1597
02:01:54,432 --> 02:01:56,224
Maggie?

1598
02:01:58,561 --> 02:02:00,228
Why did he go there?

1599
02:02:21,167 --> 02:02:22,250
There's nothing here.

1600
02:02:24,086 --> 02:02:27,547
Chris. Who did Nate see the night
before he was killed? Did Linda tell you?

1601
02:02:27,715 --> 02:02:30,592
Yeah. He went to see you,
but you weren't at the precinct.

1602
02:02:30,760 --> 02:02:32,594
You're running out of time, Danny.

1603
02:02:34,513 --> 02:02:36,639
-Dispatch, this is Commander Beck.
-Go ahead.

1604
02:02:36,807 --> 02:02:40,602
I need an air unit deployed
to the 1300 block of Addison.

1605
02:02:40,770 --> 02:02:45,190
Have available HBT units meet me
at the corner of Addison and Iroquois.

1606
02:02:45,441 --> 02:02:47,859
I also need an HPT supervisor
to clear the building.

1607
02:02:48,027 --> 02:02:49,194
Copy. Will relay.

1608
02:03:06,420 --> 02:03:08,296
Come on, Danny, there's nothing here.
It's over.

1609
02:03:10,549 --> 02:03:13,468
That's it, I'm taking you in, man.
You had your chance.

1610
02:03:16,764 --> 02:03:20,600
Look, look. Don't screw me now.
You said you were gonna give me time.

1611
02:03:20,768 --> 02:03:24,020
Now, look. I know these are the bastards
that killed Nate.

1612
02:03:24,188 --> 02:03:26,272
Now, all l need...

1613
02:03:26,816 --> 02:03:29,651
...is two minutes.
Just two minutes and your radio, all right?

1614
02:03:29,819 --> 02:03:31,403
I can make this work. Come on!

1615
02:03:50,631 --> 02:03:51,965
Hold it right there, Hellman.

1616
02:03:52,133 --> 02:03:54,634
You come down this hallway,
I'll shoot you one by one.

1617
02:03:54,802 --> 02:03:57,262
Danny. Danny Roman.

1618
02:03:57,430 --> 02:04:00,140
Come on, it's all over, huh?

1619
02:04:00,307 --> 02:04:02,225
You'll do a little time.

1620
02:04:02,518 --> 02:04:05,270
Karen will be taken care of, okay?

1621
02:04:05,438 --> 02:04:07,522
Nobody gets hurt.

1622
02:04:12,236 --> 02:04:14,946
All right? Come on. Surrender.

1623
02:04:15,114 --> 02:04:16,364
Surrender, my ass.

1624
02:04:16,532 --> 02:04:20,285
I've got two disks with your voices
on them. Nate's taps.

1625
02:04:20,453 --> 02:04:21,828
Come on down the hall!

1626
02:04:21,996 --> 02:04:24,998
I got 15 shots here. That's five apiece.

1627
02:04:36,093 --> 02:04:39,053
Whatever you're trying
to pull, Roman, it's not gonna work.

1628
02:04:39,221 --> 02:04:42,056
Stop this shit and come out
before someone gets killed.

1629
02:04:42,224 --> 02:04:46,394
Look, l know somebody else was in charge.
You couldn't have pulled this off yourself.

1630
02:04:46,562 --> 02:04:49,564
Danny, man, you got this all wrong.

1631
02:04:49,732 --> 02:04:53,359
No, l got it right.
Is that why you sound so nervous, Argento?

1632
02:04:53,903 --> 02:04:57,071
-You killed Niebaum and Nate?
-Danny, that's absurd!

1633
02:04:58,199 --> 02:05:00,074
Come on.
You know your guys out there...

1634
02:05:00,242 --> 02:05:03,369
...gonna leave you hanging for murder one
while they plea down.

1635
02:05:03,746 --> 02:05:06,372
Make a deal for yourself
while you still can, Argento.

1636
02:05:07,249 --> 02:05:10,919
Danny, I swear to you
we don't know what you're talking about.

1637
02:05:11,086 --> 02:05:12,962
All right, play dumb.

1638
02:05:13,130 --> 02:05:15,673
How could you dumb fucks
let somebody get you on tape?

1639
02:05:18,469 --> 02:05:22,096
Come on. Listen to you.
Why don't you stop this shit and come out?

1640
02:05:22,264 --> 02:05:27,435
All right, keep talking, asshole.
You've already done everything wrong.

1641
02:05:27,603 --> 02:05:31,439
You left me alive, me against you,
and l won.

1642
02:05:31,607 --> 02:05:35,735
Hey, fuck you, huh? Fuck you!

1643
02:05:35,903 --> 02:05:40,240
Let me tell you: I don't give a fuck
what kind of evidence you got. Know why?

1644
02:05:40,407 --> 02:05:42,951
Because you're not gonna make it
out of here alive, motherfucker!

1645
02:05:45,746 --> 02:05:47,455
Stand down.

1646
02:05:49,917 --> 02:05:53,795
Put your weapons down
and move your asses out of here now.

1647
02:05:57,508 --> 02:06:01,970
-Frost?
-Yeah. Danny, it's me, Frost.

1648
02:06:03,639 --> 02:06:07,016
Yeah, Danny, I'm ordering them off.
I'm locking them out now.

1649
02:06:07,184 --> 02:06:09,394
It's just you and me, buddy.

1650
02:06:10,563 --> 02:06:11,771
You hear that, Danny?

1651
02:06:12,773 --> 02:06:14,232
They're gone.

1652
02:06:15,442 --> 02:06:17,151
Listen, Danny...

1653
02:06:17,945 --> 02:06:19,487
...l know you're scared.

1654
02:06:20,406 --> 02:06:21,948
I know you don't trust anyone.

1655
02:06:24,118 --> 02:06:26,244
A lot of shit went down.

1656
02:06:26,412 --> 02:06:28,621
I don't even understand some of it myself.

1657
02:06:29,873 --> 02:06:32,875
Come on out, Danny.
You have my support.

1658
02:06:33,043 --> 02:06:37,005
Any evidence you have,
let's just bring it out there.

1659
02:06:37,381 --> 02:06:39,841
Hey, Frost. Come on.

1660
02:06:42,678 --> 02:06:45,179
What the hell are you doing here, Sabian?

1661
02:06:45,431 --> 02:06:48,433
-Finishing what you started.
-What are you talking about?

1662
02:06:48,601 --> 02:06:50,685
Roman is going out with me.

1663
02:06:50,853 --> 02:06:54,022
No one else. Alone.
We can't trust anyone else.

1664
02:06:56,775 --> 02:06:58,443
Yeah, that's right.

1665
02:06:59,361 --> 02:07:01,654
We don't know who to trust, do we?

1666
02:07:05,659 --> 02:07:07,327
Do you like Westerns, Frost?

1667
02:07:08,871 --> 02:07:11,664
What's the fuck is that supposed to mean?

1668
02:07:12,041 --> 02:07:14,709
I like Westerns.
I can't get enough of them.

1669
02:07:14,877 --> 02:07:16,127
Watch them all the time.

1670
02:07:16,295 --> 02:07:19,380
My favorites have always been
where the hero dies at the end.

1671
02:07:22,217 --> 02:07:25,053
-You remember Shane, Danny?
-What?

1672
02:07:25,220 --> 02:07:28,222
I think you're right.
Shane died at the end.

1673
02:07:37,149 --> 02:07:41,569
So you killed Nathan, I killed Danny...

1674
02:07:44,907 --> 02:07:47,909
...and now my hands
are just as dirty as yours...

1675
02:07:48,077 --> 02:07:50,244
...only l still have the evidence...

1676
02:07:50,412 --> 02:07:54,082
...so I'd say I'm in a very good position
to negotiate.

1677
02:07:54,833 --> 02:07:56,459
So you wanna deal?

1678
02:07:57,252 --> 02:07:58,753
You deal with me.

1679
02:08:00,255 --> 02:08:04,092
There's a time limit on these negotiations
because we're about to be interrupted...

1680
02:08:04,259 --> 02:08:06,552
...so let's do this quickly. I want in.

1681
02:08:06,720 --> 02:08:09,931
Sixty percent of everything you've taken.

1682
02:08:15,270 --> 02:08:17,772
I can't give you what I don't have.

1683
02:08:18,774 --> 02:08:21,401
You see, l spent a lot of my take.

1684
02:08:22,111 --> 02:08:24,904
I don't know how much Allen,
Hellman and Argento have.

1685
02:08:25,072 --> 02:08:27,115
We used a lot of it to set Roman up.

1686
02:08:27,282 --> 02:08:31,119
All right.
Fifty percent of what you don't have.

1687
02:08:31,995 --> 02:08:33,955
-Thirty percent.
-Forty-five.

1688
02:08:36,291 --> 02:08:37,417
Thirty-five.

1689
02:08:39,128 --> 02:08:40,962
You should've been a negotiator.

1690
02:08:44,216 --> 02:08:45,800
Right.

1691
02:08:45,968 --> 02:08:47,802
I want all the evidence destroyed.

1692
02:08:49,179 --> 02:08:50,596
Deal.

1693
02:08:53,392 --> 02:08:54,642
This is everything, huh?

1694
02:08:58,230 --> 02:08:59,272
What do you think?

1695
02:09:25,340 --> 02:09:27,508
Danny Roman's been shot.

1696
02:09:34,308 --> 02:09:35,475
He's dead.

1697
02:09:35,684 --> 02:09:37,518
Let's get you some help.

1698
02:09:39,354 --> 02:09:41,481
Come on. Here we go.

1699
02:09:42,524 --> 02:09:44,275
That's it. Come on.

1700
02:09:44,443 --> 02:09:46,277
There you go.

1701
02:10:00,709 --> 02:10:03,544
We got an officer down in here!

1702
02:10:17,017 --> 02:10:18,726
You have the right to remain silent.

1703
02:10:20,395 --> 02:10:22,480
If you give up the right to remain silent...

1704
02:10:22,648 --> 02:10:25,066
...anything you say
can be used against you--

1705
02:10:25,234 --> 02:10:26,901
No, no, no--

1706
02:10:55,430 --> 02:10:58,015
You're not gonna get off that easy.

1707
02:11:19,872 --> 02:11:21,914
Karen, wait.

1708
02:12:14,593 --> 02:12:18,387
-Get some help here.
-We got an injured cop here.

1709
02:13:01,223 --> 02:13:02,223
Give me your hand.

1710
02:13:05,894 --> 02:13:08,062
Danny, you know what l thought.

1711
02:13:08,397 --> 02:13:09,814
I'm sorry.

1712
02:13:22,035 --> 02:13:23,077
Sorry about that.

1713
02:13:25,914 --> 02:13:26,998
Nice bluff, Chris.

1714
02:13:27,916 --> 02:13:28,916
Well, it worked.

1715
02:13:30,293 --> 02:13:33,004
Anyway, I figured you'd rather be shot
by me than by him.

1716
02:13:33,171 --> 02:13:34,714
Yeah.

1717
02:13:34,881 --> 02:13:37,341
Here's the one demand l didn't meet yet.

1718
02:13:41,805 --> 02:13:44,015
Nice talking to you, lieutenant.

1719
02:13:47,102 --> 02:13:48,352
Thanks.

1720
02:13:49,938 --> 02:13:51,272
Let's get him out of here.

1721
02:13:52,941 --> 02:13:55,443
Eagle, make sure this location is secured.

1722
02:13:55,610 --> 02:13:59,613
I want this street cleared, right now!
Got an ambulance coming through here.

1723
02:13:59,781 --> 02:14:00,948
Move it!
