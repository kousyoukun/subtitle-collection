00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:17,780
Welcome to London Zoo!

2
00:00:17,781 --> 00:00:20,632
My name is Winnie.

3
00:00:20,633 --> 00:00:24,512
As you can see, I'm a black bear.

4
00:00:24,513 --> 00:00:27,267
I didn't always live at the zoo.

5
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:31,336
I used to live in the woods, in Canada.

6
00:00:31,337 --> 00:00:40,477
When I was a cub, a hunter killed my mother.

7
00:00:40,478 --> 00:00:45,098
Then he trapped me!

8
00:00:45,099 --> 00:00:54,403
It was 1914. An animal doctor named Harry was riding a train.

9
00:00:54,404 --> 00:01:00,552
When the train stopped, Harry saw me with the hunter.

10
00:01:00,553 --> 00:01:06,284
Harry wanted to rescue me.

11
00:01:06,285 --> 00:01:10,925
So he bought me for twenty dollars.

12
00:01:10,926 --> 00:01:14,476
Then he took me on the train!

13
00:01:14,477 --> 00:01:16,073
Can you believe it?

14
00:01:16,074 --> 00:01:19,870
A bear cub on a train!

15
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:24,996
Harry was on his way to an army camp in Canada.

16
00:01:24,997 --> 00:01:34,352
I went with Harry.

17
00:01:34,353 --> 00:01:39,868
He named me after his hometown of Winnipeg.

18
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,837
The other soldiers liked me too.

19
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:49,584
I was gentle and friendly.

20
00:01:49,585 --> 00:01:52,364
This was during World War I.

21
00:01:52,365 --> 00:01:57,371
Soon the soldiers at the camp had to go to England.

22
00:01:57,372 --> 00:02:00,676
Harry took me with him again.

23
00:02:00,677 --> 00:02:05,932
This time we traveled by ship!

24
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:11,331
But then Harry was sent to war in France.

25
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:16,809
He knew he couldn't take me there.

26
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:28,176
So he left me here at London Zoo.

27
00:02:28,177 --> 00:02:37,427
Many people came to visit me, and I made new friends.

28
00:02:37,428 --> 00:02:48,498
After the war Harry wanted to take me back to Canada.

29
00:02:48,499 --> 00:02:59,159
But he saw I was very happy here.

30
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,705
So he decided to let me stay at London Zoo.

31
00:03:04,706 --> 00:03:10,114
See that boy? His name is Christopher Robin.

32
00:03:10,115 --> 00:03:13,981
He comes here often with his father.

33
00:03:13,982 --> 00:03:26,289
Sometimes he comes into my pen and plays with me.

34
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:34,223
He even feeds me honey.

35
00:03:34,224 --> 00:03:36,406
Oh, and guess what!

36
00:03:36,407 --> 00:03:41,543
Christopher's father wrote some books about a boy and a bear.

37
00:03:41,544 --> 00:03:43,980
Have you ever heard of the bear?

38
00:03:43,981 --> 00:03:47,905
His name is Winnie-the-Pooh!

39
00:03:47,906 --> 00:03:52,132
Thanks to Harry, I'm safe and well.

40
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:59,797
And children have wonderful books to read!
