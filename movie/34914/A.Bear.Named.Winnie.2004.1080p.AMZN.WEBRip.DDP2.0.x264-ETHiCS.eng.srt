00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,482
I've just been a tad impetuous.

173
00:09:42,517 --> 00:09:44,517
Go give the Kaiser a good
kick in his royal Bosch behind.

174
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:45,310
Oh, George!

175
00:09:45,344 --> 00:09:47,620
You shouldn't say that.

176
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:48,551
[crying]

177
00:09:48,586 --> 00:09:49,724
Huh?

178
00:09:49,758 --> 00:09:51,068
All right, all right.

179
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,965
I understand.

180
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,655
I'm not really a
bear sort of person,

181
00:09:54,689 --> 00:09:57,068
and I have a train
to catch, which means

182
00:09:57,103 --> 00:09:58,724
I'm going to have to find you--

183
00:09:58,758 --> 00:10:00,965
That your bear?

184
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,413
[music playing]

185
00:10:05,482 --> 00:10:06,965
You like bears?

186
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,344
Hmm?

187
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:10,931
You know that they make
wonderful pets, far better

188
00:10:10,965 --> 00:10:11,862
than dogs.

189
00:10:11,896 --> 00:10:12,827
Did you know that?

190
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,965
My dog died.

191
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,551
Oh, I'm sorry.

192
00:10:16,586 --> 00:10:17,724
CONDUCTOR: All aboard!

193
00:10:17,758 --> 00:10:20,137
You must be sad.

194
00:10:20,172 --> 00:10:21,827
Hey, what's your name?

195
00:10:21,862 --> 00:10:23,241
Timmy McMurray.

196
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:24,413
Timmy McMurray.

197
00:10:24,448 --> 00:10:25,931
Well, I tell you
what, Timmy McMurray.

198
00:10:25,965 --> 00:10:28,241
How would you like to have a
bear for your very own pet?

199
00:10:28,275 --> 00:10:29,000
Huh?

200
00:10:29,034 --> 00:10:30,793
TIMMY'S MOTHER: Timmy.

201
00:10:30,827 --> 00:10:33,379
Get away from that man.

202
00:10:33,413 --> 00:10:34,827
TIMMY: Can we have
the bear, Mommy?

203
00:10:34,862 --> 00:10:36,551
Bears make good pets.

204
00:10:36,586 --> 00:10:37,862
He said.

205
00:10:37,896 --> 00:10:39,172
Don't be silly, dear.

206
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:41,586
Little children don't
have bears for pets.

207
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,827
Even big, brave
soldiers know that.

208
00:10:43,862 --> 00:10:47,620
TIMMY: [crying]

209
00:10:52,413 --> 00:10:53,896
What am I going
to do with you?

210
00:10:53,931 --> 00:10:56,413
Hmm?

211
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,034
You're going to get me
in trouble, aren't you?

212
00:10:58,068 --> 00:10:59,103
Aren't you?
[train whistle]

213
00:10:59,137 --> 00:11:00,379
You're gonna get me in trouble.

214
00:11:00,413 --> 00:11:02,000
Who's your friend, Harry?

215
00:11:02,034 --> 00:11:03,517
She got a name?

216
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,586
[laughter]

217
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,241
SOLDIER: What were
you thinking, Harry?

218
00:11:06,275 --> 00:11:07,793
SOLDIER: Captain's not
going to like this.

219
00:11:07,827 --> 00:11:11,137
[chatter]

220
00:11:11,172 --> 00:11:13,103
SOLDIER: I can't believe
you got a bear, Harry.

221
00:11:13,137 --> 00:11:14,482
What's your
name, little fella?

222
00:11:14,517 --> 00:11:15,931
SOLDIER: Aww, she's a sweetie.

223
00:11:15,965 --> 00:11:17,310
SOLDIER: Have you
trained him yet?

224
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:18,517
SOLDIER: Is it a she?

225
00:11:18,551 --> 00:11:19,931
Is it a she-bear?
Is this a she-bear?

226
00:11:19,965 --> 00:11:20,896
SOLDIER: You bought her?

227
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:21,793
HARRY: I bought her.

228
00:11:21,827 --> 00:11:23,241
SOLDIER: For how much?

229
00:11:23,275 --> 00:11:24,655
20.

230
00:11:24,689 --> 00:11:25,862
Holy smokes, Harry.

231
00:11:25,896 --> 00:11:27,000
That-- That's a pair.

232
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:28,344
You got a pair, there.
- Yes, I do.

233
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:30,172
Yes, I do.
- Yes, you do.

234
00:11:30,206 --> 00:11:31,758
[inaudible] a wild bear.

235
00:11:31,793 --> 00:11:32,689
HARRY: Thank you, Taylor.

236
00:11:32,724 --> 00:11:36,275
Wild bear on a train.

237
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,103
Harry, what are
you doing with that?

238
00:11:39,137 --> 00:11:40,310
[cries]

239
00:11:40,344 --> 00:11:41,724
HARRY: To tell you
the truth, Captain,

240
00:11:41,758 --> 00:11:43,413
it's not really an ambition
of mine to own a bear,

241
00:11:43,448 --> 00:11:44,482
but the circumstances were--

242
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:45,965
It's wild, sir.
A wild bear.

243
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,655
- I can see that.
- [cries]

244
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:49,068
Her mother was shot,
and she was next.

245
00:11:49,103 --> 00:11:50,413
You know the rules.

246
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:51,172
Yes, I do.

247
00:11:51,206 --> 00:11:52,103
He knows the rules.

248
00:11:52,137 --> 00:11:53,103
CAPTAIN: Taylor.

249
00:11:53,137 --> 00:11:54,275
TAYLOR: Sorry, Harry, Captain.

250
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm, uh, just, uh--

251
00:11:58,896 --> 00:12:00,586
You can't keep a pet.

252
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,758
Pet?

253
00:12:01,793 --> 00:12:03,000
Is that what you think?

254
00:12:03,034 --> 00:12:04,931
Well, whatever it
is, you can't keep it.

255
00:12:04,965 --> 00:12:06,689
That's the rule, is it?

256
00:12:06,724 --> 00:12:07,655
Afraid so.

257
00:12:07,689 --> 00:12:10,137
And rules are rules.

258
00:12:10,172 --> 00:12:12,000
CAPTAIN: There you have it.

259
00:12:12,034 --> 00:12:14,275
BEAR: [cries]

260
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:17,448
Well, there's no rule
against having a mascot.

261
00:12:17,482 --> 00:12:18,241
Mascot?

262
00:12:18,275 --> 00:12:20,931
No rule against mascot.

263
00:12:20,965 --> 00:12:22,379
Unit mascot, what
do you say, boys?

264
00:12:22,413 --> 00:12:25,172
[cheering]

265
00:12:26,137 --> 00:12:28,965
SOLDIER: This is an opportunity!

266
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,655
Mascot with no name?

267
00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:31,862
Of course she's got a name.

268
00:12:31,896 --> 00:12:32,724
CAPTAIN: Uh-huh?

269
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:35,793
SOLDIER: Come on, Harry.

270
00:12:35,827 --> 00:12:38,586
SOLDIER: Come on!

271
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,137
Winnipeg.
SOLDIER: That's right!

272
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:41,103
Winnipeg?

273
00:12:41,137 --> 00:12:42,137
[cries]

274
00:12:42,172 --> 00:12:44,000
Is that a good
name for a bear?

275
00:12:44,034 --> 00:12:45,034
Winnie for short.

276
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:46,931
SOLDIER: Winnie it is!

277
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:48,827
Winnie.

278
00:12:48,862 --> 00:12:52,068
Yeah, I like that.

279
00:12:52,103 --> 00:12:53,517
SOLDIER: Winnie.

280
00:12:53,551 --> 00:12:54,551
SOLDIER: Winnipeg, all right.
SOLDIER: Hey, Winnie!

281
00:12:54,586 --> 00:12:55,517
Winnie!

282
00:12:55,551 --> 00:12:57,379
Come here, Winnie!

283
00:12:57,413 --> 00:12:58,931
SOLDIER: We've got a mascot.

284
00:12:58,965 --> 00:13:01,689
No bears on my train.

285
00:13:01,724 --> 00:13:02,448
Oh, uh--

286
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:03,448
Well, hold on now, sir.

287
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,896
This is no ordinary bear, sir.

288
00:13:05,931 --> 00:13:07,137
No exceptions.

289
00:13:07,172 --> 00:13:08,586
CAPTAIN: He's the, uh--

290
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,379
Uh, she's.

291
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,965
She's the unit mascot.

292
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,137
I don't give a hoot if she's
the King's great-grandmother.

293
00:13:13,172 --> 00:13:16,068
I won't have a bear
defecating all over my train.

294
00:13:16,103 --> 00:13:17,586
She's not defecating.

295
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,551
Will be.

296
00:13:18,586 --> 00:13:20,137
You can count on it.

297
00:13:20,172 --> 00:13:21,517
You can count on that.

298
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:24,586
HARRY: Sir, we're all
with the Veterinary Corps.

299
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,379
We've all been trained
to deal with animals

300
00:13:26,413 --> 00:13:28,206
of all shapes and sizes.

301
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:30,206
Look, sunshine.

302
00:13:30,241 --> 00:13:32,482
Wild critters don't give two
hoots where they defecate,

303
00:13:32,517 --> 00:13:34,758
and this here one
won't be defecating

304
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:36,344
where it's against the rules.

305
00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:39,206
And that would be in
first-class coach.

306
00:13:39,241 --> 00:13:41,758
You want to keep a bear?
You keep it in freight.

307
00:13:41,793 --> 00:13:43,724

Sir?

314
00:14:13,206 --> 00:14:14,206
SOLDIER: Good morning, sir.

315
00:14:26,896 --> 00:14:30,724
And what the devil do they
think they're doing with those?

316
00:14:30,758 --> 00:14:32,034
Osbourn.
- Sir!

317
00:14:32,068 --> 00:14:33,241
Pack my charger.

318
00:14:40,758 --> 00:14:41,655
Absolute mess.

319
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:42,827
What do you think it is?

320
00:14:42,862 --> 00:14:45,896
It's nothing but a mess.

321
00:14:45,931 --> 00:14:47,758
And there's no drainage here.

322
00:14:47,793 --> 00:14:48,827
Move the tents up the slope.

323
00:14:48,862 --> 00:14:50,068
Yes, sir.

324
00:14:50,103 --> 00:14:51,206
And for heaven's
sake, keep them in rows.

325
00:14:51,241 --> 00:14:52,620
You can't have
tents helter-skelter

326
00:14:52,655 --> 00:14:53,448
all over the place.

327
00:14:53,482 --> 00:14:54,689
Order and discipline, lads.

328
00:14:54,724 --> 00:14:55,655
That's what wins wars.

329
00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:57,034
Yes, sir.

330
00:14:57,068 --> 00:14:58,517
- Carry on.
- Sir!

331

Crawford.

334
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,275
What do you make of that ragtag
bunch at the end of the ranks?

335
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:36,103
CRAWFORD: Veterinary Corps,

Fetch, uh, what's his name?

338
00:15:42,758 --> 00:15:43,655
That new man.

339
00:15:43,689 --> 00:15:44,689
Come on, what's his name?

340
00:15:44,724 --> 00:15:46,793
What's his name?

341
00:15:46,827 --> 00:15:48,551
Colonel Barret, sir.

342
00:15:48,586 --> 00:15:50,793
Barret, thank you.

343
00:15:50,827 --> 00:15:52,137
Have him deal with it.

344
00:15:52,172 --> 00:15:53,103
Yes, sir.

00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:13,275
Prepare for inspection.

348
00:16:19,689 --> 00:16:23,241
I'm Barret, Chief Veterinary
Officer and Director

349
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:25,000
of Veterinary Services.

00:16:25,034 --> 00:16:28,034
I don't care who your father
is, what school you went to,

351
00:16:28,068 --> 00:16:30,724
or any of that
high-brow baloney.

352
00:16:30,758 --> 00:16:33,310
As of this moment you
represent your country

353
00:16:33,344 --> 00:16:36,206
as part of the 1st
Division of the Canadian

Expeditionary Force.

355
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:40,275
From all the
information I can gather

356
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,482
and what I can see
with my own two eyes,

357
00:16:42,517 --> 00:16:45,517
your military training
has been slight to nil.

00:16:56,241 --> 00:16:59,758
Our unit mascot, sir!

Get rid of it.

I don't believe in
mascots, and you men

367
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,241
must close your picnic
hampers and begin

368
00:17:16,275 --> 00:17:17,793
to harden your hearts.

369
00:17:17,827 --> 00:17:19,413
What you are about
to face is more

370
00:17:19,448 --> 00:17:21,793
vicious and terrifying
than anything

371
00:17:21,827 --> 00:17:23,172
you can possibly imagine.

You can't just leave
her in the woods.

375
00:17:31,586 --> 00:17:33,827
There's wolves and
foxes and coyotes and--

376
00:17:33,862 --> 00:17:36,206
Thank you, Corporal.

377

She wants you to, um--

378
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:38,896
Yes, I'm aware of that.

379
00:17:38,931 --> 00:17:40,000
Yeah, it can't be this row.

380
00:17:40,034 --> 00:17:41,275
It's got to be the next row.

381
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,965
Well, maybe another
regiment will take her.

382
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,068
I mean there's no regulation--

383
00:17:44,103 --> 00:17:45,275
The order was
to get rid of her.

384
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,965
Well, you never
used to follow orders.

385
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,275
Yes, we're having
a lovely little war,

Oh, I'm sorry.

Well.

As a man thinks, so he becomes.

Huh?

00:18:48,448 --> 00:18:51,344
Harry, I have some news, and
you're not going to like it.

408
00:18:51,379 --> 00:18:54,103
I-- I was tying her up right
here, and then I looked away.

And then I looked back, and
she-- she- she was gone.

Wh-- wh-- who-- who's gone?

414
00:19:01,068 --> 00:19:02,620
It's Winnie.

Who's Winnie?

416
00:19:03,724 --> 00:19:04,517
It's our bear.

have women in the army?

Actually, sir,
I've often wondered.

COLONEL BARRET: When
the shooting starts,

454
00:21:45,068 --> 00:21:47,551
the men rush to protect.

455
00:21:47,586 --> 00:21:51,862
To fight and live requires
a soldier's full attention.

Eye on the ball, not the bear.

457
00:21:55,137 --> 00:21:56,931
Yes, sir, but
the general seems

quite adamant about
having a mascot as--

Yes, I understand
the situation.

[music - "reveille"]

465
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,034
So they have teeth, of
course, and the intestinal tract

00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:41,275
of a carnivore.
But--

Come here.
Winnie.

468
00:22:42,758 --> 00:22:45,655
Uh, but they, um, they're
opportunistic eaters and--

469
00:22:45,689 --> 00:22:47,965
which makes them
omnivorous and explains

470
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,275
their fondness for ants.

471
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:52,275
She'd have to
eat a great number.

472
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:55,655
Yes, that would be
a factor, wouldn't it.

473
00:22:55,689 --> 00:22:58,586
It says here their
olfactory sense--

474
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,862
that means you-- is
more acute than a dog's

Isn't that amazing?

00:23:05,586 --> 00:23:07,379
Yeah, that's why
their noses are bigger.

about bears, do you?

know about, really.

Yes.

497
00:23:38,448 --> 00:23:39,724
I think what's important is
that she needs to learn how

498
00:23:39,758 --> 00:23:41,793
to defend herself and
forage for herself

00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:55,793
well, they'll be shot.

1007
00:57:59,758 --> 00:58:02,310
Will that be all, Colonel?

1008
00:58:02,344 --> 00:58:05,310
Men prepared to sacrifice
their lives for their country

1009
00:58:05,344 --> 00:58:07,241
should not be
treated as children.

1010
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:12,551
Don't you tell me
how to run my army.

1011
00:58:12,586 --> 00:58:15,103
General, the Canadian
Expeditionary Force

1012
00:58:15,137 --> 00:58:17,103
is not your private
army, and I will not

1013
00:58:17,137 --> 00:58:19,517
stand by while the
lives of 30,000 men

1014
00:58:19,551 --> 00:58:22,551
are compromised by
some vainglorious whim.

1015
00:58:22,586 --> 00:58:26,241
Who the hell do
you think you are?

1016
00:58:26,275 --> 00:58:29,310
Don't you dare talk
to me like that!

1017
00:58:29,344 --> 00:58:31,827
Do you know who I am?

1018
00:58:31,862 --> 00:58:35,310
Do you realize the
prime minister--

1019
00:58:35,344 --> 00:58:37,103
your father was a
nothing, a nobody,

1020
00:58:37,137 --> 00:58:38,793
and that's exactly
where you'll end up if I

1021
00:58:38,827 --> 00:58:40,172
have any say in the matter.

1022
00:58:40,206 --> 00:58:46,758
Sir, the sun is about
to set on your day to have

1023
00:58:46,793 --> 00:58:48,310
a say in anything that matters.

1024
00:58:48,344 --> 00:58:51,448
And as to your other point,
my father didn't need to wear

1025
00:58:51,482 --> 00:58:54,448
a uniform to be a man of honor.

1026
00:59:01,103 --> 00:59:02,068
Get off!

don't do this to me, bear.

Oh, my goodness, you stink.

1042
01:00:30,172 --> 01:00:32,137
I know exactly
where you've been.

1043
01:00:32,172 --> 01:00:33,344
Come on, let's go.

1044
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:36,689
Corporal, we need
to have a chat.

1046

Hmm?

1047
01:00:44,689 --> 01:00:45,620
Hmm?

1048
01:00:45,655 --> 01:00:47,517
No problems last night?

1049
01:00:47,551 --> 01:00:48,758
No, sir--

1050
01:00:48,793 --> 01:00:49,586
Harry.

1051
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:54,896
Are you all right?

1052
01:00:54,931 --> 01:00:56,275
Yeah, everything's fine.

1053
01:00:56,310 --> 01:00:57,689
Just another day in--

1054
01:00:57,724 --> 01:01:01,586
Gasoline, oil, and oxygen.
It's highly combustible.

1055
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:03,724
That's what makes
the engine go.

1056
01:01:03,758 --> 01:01:07,206
Yes, I know, but, uh, what I'm
wondering is whether, uh, well,

1057
01:01:07,241 --> 01:01:10,172
between here and where we're
going, we-- we wouldn't be

1058
01:01:10,206 --> 01:01:13,724
in harm's way at all, would we?

Harry, are you positive
this is the only way?

1061
01:01:20,344 --> 01:01:24,379
It's the only fence
that's not patrolled.

1062
01:01:24,413 --> 01:01:25,551
- Get down!
- [cries]

1064
01:01:26,482 --> 01:01:27,310
Down!

1065
01:01:27,344 --> 01:01:28,344
That would be the reason why.

1067

You, there!

1068
01:01:39,517 --> 01:01:41,103
That's no way to
treat your weapon.

1069
01:01:41,137 --> 01:01:42,379
Sir?

1070
01:01:42,413 --> 01:01:46,620
This here Ross rifle's a
terrible piece of junk.

1071
01:01:46,655 --> 01:01:47,689
Heats up.

1072
01:01:47,724 --> 01:01:49,517
Jams up all the time.

1073
01:01:49,551 --> 01:01:50,689
Breech explodes.

1074
01:01:50,724 --> 01:01:52,448
Can't shoot straight,
even if I'm trying to-

1075
01:01:52,482 --> 01:01:55,517
It's a poor workman
who blames his tools!

1076
01:01:55,551 --> 01:01:56,413
Yes, sir!

1077
01:02:14,482 --> 01:02:17,034
All right, listen
up, everybody.

1078

SOLDIER: Get down!

1079
01:02:20,448 --> 01:02:27,034
Now let me tell you the Ross
repeater is the most perfect

1080
01:02:27,068 --> 01:02:29,689
military rifle in the world.

1081
01:02:37,586 --> 01:02:39,034
I helped modify it.

1082
01:02:42,344 --> 01:02:47,758
This weapon is the most
accurate weapon ever fired.

1083
01:02:51,689 --> 01:02:54,827
Every single one of you
should be able to pink

1084
01:02:54,862 --> 01:02:56,724

Let's go.

01:03:28,275 --> 01:03:31,137
Harry, I must say I
feel rather exposed.

1091
01:03:31,172 --> 01:03:33,689
Here, take Winnie.

1092
01:03:33,724 --> 01:03:36,896
Not to worry, with
this little beaut

1093
01:03:36,931 --> 01:03:40,413
we will be there
and back in no time.

1094
01:03:40,448 --> 01:03:42,379
There's not a lot of room
there for me and the bear,

1095
01:03:42,413 --> 01:03:43,206
is it?

1096
01:03:43,241 --> 01:03:44,275
What's that?

Do-- do you have any
idea what just occurred?

1103
01:04:12,448 --> 01:04:13,620
I think I do.

All right, Winnie.

1107
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:39,827
It's time for you
to do your business.

1108
01:04:44,034 --> 01:04:46,068
Still have a fair ways to go.

1109
01:04:46,103 --> 01:04:49,275
We don't want you to be doing
your business in the sidecar

1110
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:53,068
as there's not much room for a
bear's business in the sidecar.

1111
01:05:01,206 --> 01:05:02,655
Harry, I've been, uh--

01:05:02,689 --> 01:05:04,482
Thinking?

1113
01:05:04,517 --> 01:05:06,827
Indeed.

1114
01:05:06,862 --> 01:05:08,689
About?

1115
01:05:08,724 --> 01:05:14,103
Well, should anything
unfortunate occur,

1116
01:05:14,137 --> 01:05:17,206
I would like my mother to, um--

1117
01:05:17,241 --> 01:05:18,896
you see, she wasn't for this.

1118
01:05:18,931 --> 01:05:19,724
It would be my honor.

1119
01:05:22,689 --> 01:05:25,000
Thank you.

1120
01:05:25,034 --> 01:05:26,862
But it won't come to that.

1121
01:05:26,896 --> 01:05:28,689
Oh, no?

1122
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:31,517
Well, you haven't swallowed
that home by Christmas nonsense,

1123
01:05:31,551 --> 01:05:32,793
have you?

1124
01:05:32,827 --> 01:05:33,724
No.

1125
01:05:33,758 --> 01:05:35,310
Then?

1126
01:05:35,344 --> 01:05:36,965
Faith.

1127
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,275
That's funny.

1128
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:40,517
What?

1129
01:05:40,551 --> 01:05:44,137
I wouldn't have taken you
for a man of the church.

1130
01:05:44,172 --> 01:05:45,206
Faith in you.

look and at this!

MAN: He's a beast, isn't he?

1135
01:05:56,034 --> 01:05:57,137
Ah, look at him.

1136
01:05:57,172 --> 01:05:59,413
She is, uh, clean, isn't she?

1137
01:05:59,448 --> 01:06:02,068
It doesn't do to,
uh, muck up a zoo

1138
01:06:02,103 --> 01:06:04,517
with some mangy,
flea-ridden creature.

[crying]

1140
01:06:05,413 --> 01:06:07,103
They spread disease, you know.

1141
01:06:07,137 --> 01:06:08,724
Bears have their own
diseases, of course,

1142
01:06:08,758 --> 01:06:10,689
but they affect other animals.

1143
01:06:10,724 --> 01:06:13,896
Had a cross-infection between
a giraffe and a beaver once.

1144
01:06:13,931 --> 01:06:15,137
Very nasty.

1145
01:06:15,172 --> 01:06:16,413
Well, here we are.

1146
01:06:16,448 --> 01:06:21,310
One of our larger, more
spacious enclosures.

1147
01:06:21,344 --> 01:06:26,137
As secure and reliable
as the Pope has penury.

1148
01:06:26,172 --> 01:06:27,862
Oh, now listen.

1149
01:06:27,896 --> 01:06:28,862
I shouldn't worry.

1150
01:06:28,896 --> 01:06:30,551
She'll soon accustom herself.

1151
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:32,000
They all do.

1152
01:06:32,034 --> 01:06:34,586
HARRY: Winnie's used to a fair
bit of human companionship, Mr.

1153
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:35,689
Protheroe.

1154
01:06:35,724 --> 01:06:36,758
MACRAY: She-- She's
been tamed, you see.

1155
01:06:36,793 --> 01:06:38,275
Yeah, completely tamed.

1156
01:06:38,310 --> 01:06:40,655
Yes, well, no animal is ever
completely tame, are they?

1157
01:06:40,689 --> 01:06:42,068
Winnie's different.

1158
01:06:42,103 --> 01:06:43,965
Look, I can't take risks, not
as far as the general public

1159
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,206
is concerned.

1160
01:06:45,241 --> 01:06:46,137
We know her.

1161
01:06:46,172 --> 01:06:48,413
Intimately.

1162
01:06:48,448 --> 01:06:50,413
Uh, well, so-- so to speak.

1163
01:06:50,448 --> 01:06:51,724
She needs human contact.

1164
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:54,724
Yes, well, she'll have
me and the underkeepers.

1165
01:06:54,758 --> 01:06:56,448
We're perfectly convivial.

01:06:59,034 --> 01:07:00,793
I don't think you
understand, Mr. Protheroe.

1168
01:07:00,827 --> 01:07:02,137
Believe me, Lieutenant.

1169
01:07:02,172 --> 01:07:05,689
I have worked with bears
for the past 20 years.

1170
01:07:05,724 --> 01:07:07,689
Yes, they can be beguiling.

1171
01:07:07,724 --> 01:07:10,482
They have a-- a knack of
amusing us and putting

1172
01:07:10,517 --> 01:07:11,620
us at our ease, so to speak.

1173
01:07:11,655 --> 01:07:14,344
But believe me when
I tell you this,

1174
01:07:14,379 --> 01:07:16,344
you can never lower
your guard, not

1175
01:07:16,379 --> 01:07:18,103
for an instant, not with bears.

I don't think Winnie
knows she's a bear.

1178
01:07:23,586 --> 01:07:25,310
Yes, well, listen,
I've got to lock up,

1179
01:07:25,344 --> 01:07:28,068
so you, uh, say
your final goodbyes.

1180
01:07:28,103 --> 01:07:29,137
All right?

WINNIE: [cries]

1182
01:07:35,068 --> 01:07:38,241
Hey, we have to go
away for a while, Winnie.

1183
01:07:38,275 --> 01:07:39,413
OK?

1184
01:07:39,448 --> 01:07:43,551
No place for bears, so
you have to stay here.

1185
01:07:43,586 --> 01:07:45,379
You understand?

1186
01:07:45,413 --> 01:07:47,586
Mr. Protheroe's going
to look after you now.

1187
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:51,931
Stop.

1188

1189
01:07:52,896 --> 01:07:53,793
Winnie, play fair.

1190
01:07:53,827 --> 01:07:54,689

You're an impossible
bear, you know that?

1193
01:07:59,862 --> 01:08:01,206
This is what we're going to do.

1194
01:08:01,241 --> 01:08:04,517
I'm going to come back,
and we'll get in a ship.

1195
01:08:04,551 --> 01:08:06,862
And we'll go back to Canada.

1196
01:08:06,896 --> 01:08:08,655
We'll go home together, promise.

Time to eat, Winnie.

Lovely bits of fresh fruit.

I cut it meself.

Come on, girl.

1211
01:10:06,862 --> 01:10:08,758
Any luck?

1212
01:10:08,793 --> 01:10:10,896
Same as every day, sir.

1213
01:10:10,931 --> 01:10:11,758
Won't touch nothing.

1214
01:10:19,758 --> 01:10:22,068
That was peculiar.

1215
01:10:22,103 --> 01:10:23,172
What, sir?

1216
01:10:23,206 --> 01:10:25,103
Oh, the way she
just looked at me.

1217
01:10:25,137 --> 01:10:27,206
I could have sworn--

1218
01:10:27,241 --> 01:10:28,689
Just curious, probably.

1219
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:30,620
No, it was more than that.

1220
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,965
It was her eyes.

1221
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,275
It wasn't like an animal at all.

1222
01:10:33,310 --> 01:10:35,310
It was as if she could
see what I was thinking.

1223
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:44,034
Whatever she is, sir,
she's gonna starve.

1224
01:10:44,068 --> 01:10:46,344
Yeah, well, I'm afraid it
may be past that point already.

1225
01:10:50,482 --> 01:10:53,965
Well, she's really not looking
very well at all, is she?

1226
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,896
No.

1227
01:10:55,931 --> 01:10:57,310
I don't like the look of her.

1228

missing the soldiers.

A little girl.

She's wearing a
blue dress, and--

1237

it's a green dress
with, um, brocade.

1238
01:11:28,482 --> 01:11:30,206
She had a little gold locket.
