22
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,469
<i>This way, mister.</i>

23
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,280
Let me go home.

24
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:11,014
You know what it means
to come to this side of the gate.

25
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:14,852
- I'm going home.
- Come inside, quick.

26
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,228
Oharu?

27
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,136
You couldn't find
a customer either?

28
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,142
A woman of 50
can't make herself look 20.

29
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,579
If you feel that way,
imagine how the rest of us feel.

30
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:15,413
An old man took me
to an inn for pilgrims.

31
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,980
I was glad
to get some business,

32
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,057
so I went along.

33
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,662
Some pilgrims were gathered.
He held a candle up to my face.

34
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,593
A candle?

35
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:29,390
Then he said
to the young men there...

36
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,434
"Look how she tries
to hide her age!

37
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,508
Would you sleep
with a woman like this?"

38
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:42,747
I think he was giving them
a lesson in karmic retribution.

39
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:46,516
You're off
to a bad start tonight.

40
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,015
Look, the old man's
making a fire again.

41
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,488
Let's warm up
before heading home.

42
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:18,211
Old man, let us get warm.

43
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,796
You used to serve
in the imperial court.

44
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:37,732
Did you ever think
you'd end up like this?

45
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,204
How did you fall so far?

46
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,310
Please don't ask about my past.

47
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,680
<i>Hey!</i>

48
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:04,623
Making fires again!

49
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:10,030
I guess it's all right,
but be very careful.

50
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,703
We will.

51
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:14,202
Don't worry so much
or you'll go...

52
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,307
Oh, I guess
it's too late to go bald.

53
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,265
Where are you going
in such finery?

54
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:13,929
To make an offering at the temple
on behalf of my master.

55
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:15,971
That's good of you.

56
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:19,576
You should see the sights too,
since you so rarely get out.

57
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,213
I'd be scolded if I did that.

58
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:25,782
Not at all. Just pretend
you didn't know any better.

59
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:32,021
You're going home early,
Lord Kikunokoji.

60
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,782
I almost forgot...

61
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:39,590
Nishinotoin is anxious
for your reply to his poem.

62
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:44,759
He can't keep anything
a secret, can he?

63
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:48,236
It seems his poem
was rather forward.

64
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:49,669
What did it say?

65
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,740
I don't know.

66
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,008
Please excuse me.

67
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:30,339
Wait! Please wait!

68
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,514
Please wait!

69
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:40,919
My name is Katsunosuke.

70
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:46,654
Lord Kikunokoji begs your indulgence
to discuss a certain matter.

71
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:51,303
Might I ask you to call at the house
of his friend in Teramachi?

72
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:55,335
I'm sorry, but I've been sent
to the temple on an errand.

73
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,339
Then perhaps
on your way home.

74
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:02,105
We would be deeply grateful
for just a moment of your time.

75
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,374
Lady Oharu.

76
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:19,719
Did you read the letter
I sent the other day?

77
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,993
Of course not.

78
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,891
Who would read a letter
from a lowly retainer?

79
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:28,158
I burned it
without reading a word.

80
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:36,640
I have no talent
for composing verse.

81
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,505
I lack the wit
even to tell jokes well.

82
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,880
But my heart is true.

83
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:48,118
You can look down
upon my low rank,

84
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,153
but not upon my sincerity.

85
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:56,923
The nobility makes sport of sincerity,
turning it into mere wordplay.

86
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,522
If that's how they define
elegance, then I...

87
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:04,135
You'll never know
the meaning of elegance.

88
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:08,868
You can't understand
the tastes of the nobility.

89
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,541
Well, then...

90
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:15,743
does any nobleman love you
as truly as I do?

91
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,576
Has any asked to marry you
and give you a happy home?

92
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,411
Please leave.

93
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,414
I say this because
I want to see you happy.

94
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,422
I don't need your concern.

95
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,897
If you truly dislike me
as a person,

96
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,760
I'll leave you alone.

97
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,731
Yes, I do!

98
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:41,263
But if it's my low rank
you disdain,

99
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,304
then I'll never give up.

100
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:44,840
Go away.

101
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:48,036
Lady Oharu, a human being...
no, a woman

102
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:51,614
can only be happy
if she marries for love.

103
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,978
Rank and money
don't mean happiness.

104
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:58,145
I asked you to leave.
I didn't come here to listen to you.

105
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:01,690
I'll wait alone
for Lord Kikunokoji.

106
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:03,692
I said leave.

107
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,693
My lord isn't coming.

108
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,337
Please wait!

109
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,368
I'm sorry.

110
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:20,873
I simply had to see you.

111
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,440
Ever since
you came to the court,

112
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,016
every glimpse of you
has torn at my heart.

113
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:30,211
Please at least consider
what I've said.

114
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:35,621
I did read your letter.

115
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:39,189
But no matter what you say,

116
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,696
we can never be together.

117
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,026
Why not?

118
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:49,664
Neither the court nor my father
would ever allow it.

119
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,309
Then we'll run away.

120
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,072
We'll make a home of our own.

121
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:57,905
I'll do my utmost.

122
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,278
I'd gladly do anything
to protect you.

123
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,847
Lady Oharu!

124
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,089
Madam, we have guests.

125
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:17,059
Welcome.

126
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,991
The imperial magistrate
sent us.

127
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:21,257
We understand that
prostitutes use this house.

128
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,993
That's absurd!
Who said such a thing?

129
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:25,966
I'll see for myself.

130
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,132
Who are you?

131
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,565
I'm just passing through.

132
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,538
Aren't you a retainer?

133
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,201
Yes.

134
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:12,079
I belong to the Todo clan
of Iga province.

135
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:15,515
My name is Inosuke.
I serve Lord Senuemon Yasui.

136
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,131
You dress
like a noblewoman.

137
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,099
Where are you from, whore?

138
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:36,105
How dare you!
I'm not a prostitute.

139
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,402
I'm the daughter
of Shinzaemon Okui,

140
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,540
a samurai
serving Chion-in Temple.

141
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,844
Take her.

142
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,984
I'm taking you
to the magistrate.

143
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:53,986
Go!

144
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,266
Oharu Okui, while serving
in the imperial court,

145
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:04,766
you violated protocol

146
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:08,565
by associating
with a personage of low birth.

147
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:12,835
As punishment for this illicit liaison,
you are sentenced as follows:

148
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:17,709
You are hereby banished
from the city of Kyoto,

149
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:21,408
never to return.

150
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:26,080
Your parents, for failing
to provide proper guidance,

151
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:29,523
are hereby also
sentenced to exile.

152
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:35,428
This judgment
is effective today,

153
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:40,628
the 7th of November, 1686.

154
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:44,765
Katsufusa Itakura,
Magistrate of Temples and Shrines.

155
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:51,799
Stop!

156
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:56,306
Relatives may go no further.
Bid them farewell here.

157
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:28,563
It's your fault we must live out here
in the middle of nowhere.

158
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:32,736
You've single-handedly destroyed
this noble family's honor.

159
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:34,639
You're a horrible child.

160
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:39,342
Why is it wrong for a man
and woman to fall in love?

161
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,919
Why is it immoral?

162
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,045
What?

163
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,782
You slept with a man
without our consent.

164
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:50,860
If that isn't immoral, what is?
Stop talking nonsense!

165
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:53,121
So what if we differ in rank?

166
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:57,860
How can it be wrong
if we truly love one another?

167
00:23:58,236 --> 00:23:59,601
Silence!

168
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:15,710
Do you have
any last words?

169
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:19,846
Yes.

170
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:24,360
Please give Lady Oharu
the following message.

171
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:25,962
Very well.

172
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:28,125
Proceed.

173
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,664
"Please find a good man

174
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,499
and make a happy home.

175
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:39,101
But be sure to marry

176
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,644
only for true love."

177
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:47,950
Is that all?

178
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:52,321
Anything else?

179
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,896
I hope the day will come

180
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:02,896
when people can love freely,
regardless of rank or class.

181
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:24,277
Oharu!

182
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:07,424
It was a messenger
from the magistrate.

183
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,234
He brought
Katsunosuke's will.

184
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:19,942
But you mustn't tell Father.

185
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,885
Oharu, stop!
What are you doing?

186
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,394
Let me go!

187
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,871
Stop!

188
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:02,853
Wait, Oharu!

189
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,578
Leave me alone!

190
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,590
I'm going
to join Katsunosuke!

191
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,761
Stop!

192
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:17,894
You mustn't!

193
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:20,731
Let me go!

194
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,765
This isn't
the end of the world!

195
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,034
If you kill yourself,
that's the end!

196
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,417
- An express messenger has come.
- From where?

197
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:50,025
- Lord Matsudaira in Edo.
- Matsudaira? Oh, goodness!

198
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:58,828
What is it?

199
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:01,062
A messenger
from Lord Matsudaira.

200
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:03,866
Show him
into the drawing room at once.

201
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,043
I'll change
into something else.

202
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:29,199
Are you all right?

203
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,511
Oh, my!

204
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,750
Give him a hand.

205
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,389
Now leave us alone.

206
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:04,263
Thank you for your trouble.

207
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,630
It must be a matter
of grave importance.

208
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,268
To tell you the truth,

209
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:13,505
I seek a concubine
for Lord Matsudaira.

210
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:16,374
- A concubine?
- That's right.

211
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:24,518
You rushed here from Edo
to find a concubine?

212
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,381
This is no laughing matter!

213
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:31,826
Lady Matsudaira's illness
has left her barren.

214
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:36,399
The clan will be ruined
if the lord has no heir.

215
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:40,967
There can be
no greater calamity.

216
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:44,233
The retainers,
sick with worry,

217
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:48,071
quickly found
some suitable young women,

218
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,475
but they were all
country girls

219
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,481
and not
to the lord's liking.

220
00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:59,212
Give me that.

221
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,485
The retainers were at a loss

222
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:10,225
and decided that since Kyoto
is famous for its women,

223
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:13,632
there must be one here
that he would like.

224
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:16,830
They ordered me
to rush here and find her.

225
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,032
Is that so?

226
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:24,773
I was worried His Lordship
was seeking a large loan.

227
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:30,020
Your mission seems
a rather simple one.

228
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:33,315
I'm afraid
it isn't so simple.

229
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:36,118
He has some
very specific requirements.

230
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:41,594
Look at that!

231
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:43,494
To put it simply,

232
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:47,802
he wants a girl like that.

233
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:49,974
I see.

234
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,706
First of all,

235
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:59,941
"She should be
between 15 and 18.

236
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:03,015
Her face should be
fashionably round.

237
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:05,382
Her eyes
must be round too.

238
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:08,222
Thick eyebrows,

239
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:10,725
with enough space
between the eyes.

240
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:15,457
A small mouth, with a full set
of even white teeth.

241
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:18,568
Long ears
with narrow rims

242
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:22,035
and detached,
translucent lobes.

243
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:28,372
A natural, unaltered hairline.
A long neck without wisps of hair.

244
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:32,874
Long, slender fingers
with diaphanous nails."

245
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:37,246
That's a tall order.

246
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,980
- There's more.
- More?

247
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:43,922
"Feet smaller than eight inches,
with nice arches.

248
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:46,791
She must have
a long, willowy torso,

249
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:50,331
a firm waist, but not too muscular,
a plump bottom,

250
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:52,196
a pleasant demeanor,

251
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:55,032
a fine figure
in whatever she wears,

252
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:57,173
noble in birth,
meek in personality,

253
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:59,606
and without
a single mole on her body."

254
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,476
Slender fingers...

255
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,881
Let me see your face.
Her mouth is too big.

256
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:13,556
How old are you?
- Twenty-five.

257
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,817
Oh, you're the leftovers.

258
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:18,018
I'm her father, sir.

259
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,496
No, her ears are too small.

260
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:24,367
Her face isn't round enough.
- What about her?

261
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:29,532
She just might be it!
Let me see the picture.

262
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:31,470
Let's check.

263
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,439
Her face is too long.

264
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,873
Her face is round.

265
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:41,818
Kahei, she may be the one.

266
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:44,787
No, she has a mole.

267
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,220
Her eyes are too slanted.

268
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:50,088
Her nose is crooked.

269
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:51,660
Her nose is flat.

270
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:54,422
She has a mole.

271
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,134
Her hairline is uneven.
- What about this one?

272
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:01,032
She looks promising!

273
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:04,368
She might be the one.
Turn her that way.

274
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:07,602
Your foot size?
- Ten inches.

275
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:09,975
What a pity!

276
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:15,882
Let's see here.

277
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:18,351
No, her chin is too pointed.

278
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,992
No, her forehead
is too broad.

279
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:25,287
- Please look at my girl.
- She looks sickly.

280
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:29,158
This one's ears are wrong.

281
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:33,066
What about her?

282
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,034
Her chin isn't right.

283
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:54,824
Even in Kyoto,

284
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:59,486
nobody could assemble
as many beauties

285
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:02,291
as I have here today.

286
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,903
There's nothing more
I can do.

287
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:15,140
Won't you choose
one of them?

288
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:18,772
Are none of them suitable?

289
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:34,326
If the point is
to produce an heir,

290
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:38,261
any girl should do,
as long as she's healthy.

291
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:40,464
"Thick eyebrows,

292
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:43,265
enough space
between the eyes,

293
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:47,643
a small mouth, with a full set
of even white teeth..."

294
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:50,143
You have it memorized.

295
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:54,444
I'll drop dead
before I find such a woman.

296
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,950
I sympathize...

297
00:35:57,121 --> 00:36:01,581
but why send a man your age
on such a mission?

298
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:03,521
I'll tell you why:

299
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:06,060
A younger man
might try something.

300
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:09,927
But me? I couldn't do
anything even if I tried.

301
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:12,035
I see.

302
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,405
What's that?

303
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:20,407
A blind man from Edo
teaches singing and dancing

304
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:24,514
to the daughters
of good families.

305
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:26,182
Really?

306
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:29,182
The girls are popular
among the samurai

307
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:32,618
and serve at their parties.

308
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:34,688
Is that right?

309
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:41,059
<i>The town</i>

310
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:48,968
<i>Is laid out in a grid</i>

311
00:36:54,145 --> 00:37:00,243
<i>Just like a Go board</i>

312
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:29,078
<i>Facing</i>

313
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:37,779
<i>Each other</i>

314
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:44,823
<i>Your hand</i>

315
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:50,861
<i>Clasped in mine</i>

316
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:04,174
<i>All is well</i>

317
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:14,749
<i>Let us lie</i>
<i>in each other's arms</i>

318
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,197
Her!

319
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:23,824
Come here a minute.

320
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,003
Let's have
a good look at her.

321
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,646
Face the other way.

322
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:37,709
Turn her again.

323
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,051
Do you have
any moles on your body?

324
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:49,254
- Moles?
- Do you?

325
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,118
No.

326
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,196
- None at all?
- I don't think so.

327
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:58,392
Kahei, the search is over!
I'll buy her!

328
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,935
Yes, indeed.

329
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:19,255
The messenger from Edo
is awaiting your reply.

330
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:22,415
I'll rush back
and tell him you consent.

331
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,854
What a relief.

332
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,088
If she bears him an heir,

333
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:29,562
it will bring
even greater happiness

334
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:31,725
to you than to her.

335
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:34,962
And to me as well,
as her new godfather.

336
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:42,806
Thank you very much.

337
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:44,546
If you please.

338
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,643
Thank you for everything.

339
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,859
We must be thankful.
Things are looking up.

340
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:58,859
I never expected
anything like this to happen.

341
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:02,590
Oharu,
you've redeemed yourself.

342
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:07,392
All is forgiven.

343
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:13,102
Who would imagine mere
dancing lessons could lead to this?

344
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,642
We certainly had no idea!

345
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:18,145
You'll get 100 <i>ryo</i>
for clothing,

346
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:21,045
and an allowance too.

347
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:24,418
What's wrong?
Aren't you happy?

348
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:27,216
I'm to be a concubine,
am I not?

349
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:29,316
What of it?

350
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:32,689
He's a daimyo
with a stipend of 30,000 <i>koku.</i>

351
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:36,993
You were at the imperial court,
so surely you understand.

352
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:40,797
If a lord favors you,
you'll be given high rank.

353
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:42,438
Indeed!

354
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,473
You've been chosen
to bear the heir to the line.

355
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:48,042
You'll be a high-ranking
lady-in-waiting.

356
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:49,473
That's right.

357
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:55,346
I must ask the court
not to reveal her secret

358
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:57,783
before Lord Matsudaira
begins his inquiries.

359
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:01,048
- And the temple too.
- Yes. I'll go now.

360
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:05,217
Then we'll decide what to buy
and what to take to Edo.

361
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:07,294
Come, Oharu.

362
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:10,023
- I don't want to go.
- What?

363
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:14,466
Going to a complete stranger
just to bear his child!

364
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:18,272
It won't be just any child.

365
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,467
He'll be heir
to a <i>30,000-koku</i> domain!

366
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,805
Katsunosuke would
never approve.

367
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:27,241
You idiot!
Still going on about him!

368
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:29,248
I've accepted the offer!

369
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,479
You can't back out!

370
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:21,461
She's in excellent
physical condition.

371
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:24,964
She is capable
of bearing a child.

372
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:28,370
Lady Kasai...

373
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:31,166
instruct her
in our etiquette

374
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,573
and take her
to Lady Matsudaira.

375
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,473
Yes, my lord.

376
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:29,563
The messenger
has returned from Kyoto

377
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:32,702
with the girl chosen
to be the concubine.

378
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:35,401
Already?

379
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,133
She's waiting outside.

380
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,401
Will you receive her?

381
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,684
Please endure this
for the sake of the clan.

382
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:29,187
Her name is Oharu Okui.

383
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:34,327
Show your face.

384
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:40,361
Won't you pay homage
to Her Ladyship?

385
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:46,439
You may go now.

386
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:54,610
<i>Princess Morning Glory</i>
<i>answered the nobleman</i>

387
00:46:55,813 --> 00:47:03,845
<i>She plucked the flowers</i>
<i>and offered them</i>

388
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,551
Come sit here.

389
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:12,488
<i>For a long time</i>

390
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:35,411
<i>She stares pensively</i>
<i>at the flower in her hand</i>

391
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:37,679
Does it remind you of Kyoto?

392
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:41,416
You didn't expect to see Bunraku
plays here in Edo, did you?

393
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:43,157
No, I didn't.

394
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:50,232
<i>Can this be real</i>

395
00:47:57,507 --> 00:48:03,207
<i>It is her fate</i>

396
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:10,683
<i>To wither</i>

397
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:16,486
<i>In the shade</i>

398
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:26,769
<i>Day and night</i>

399
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:36,376
<i>She stares</i>
<i>at the deutzia blossoms</i>

400
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:42,416
<i>They fill her heart</i>

401
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,948
Can you eat
the food here in Edo?

402
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:50,324
If you don't like anything,
just say so.

403
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:55,656
<i>By good fortune</i>

404
00:48:55,866 --> 00:49:02,066
<i>She is given</i>

405
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:11,237
<i>To the imperial palace</i>

406
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:15,481
<i>What a lucky flower</i>

407
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:26,687
<i>How enviable</i>

408
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:32,593
<i>How fortunate you are</i>

409
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:38,400
<i>Reluctantly</i>

410
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:47,509
<i>She offers</i>

411
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:56,516
<i>The flower in her hand</i>

412
00:49:57,527 --> 00:50:02,863
<i>But this flower</i>
<i>is only the go-between</i>

413
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:07,935
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>your face is the flower</i>

414
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:18,806
<i>That captured my heart</i>

415
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:44,566
She has given birth
to an heir.

416
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:47,801
Inform the head maid.

417
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:05,984
Auspicious news:
An heir has been born!

418
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:09,097
A boy!
Auspicious indeed!

419
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:11,631
We must inform
His Lordship at once.

420
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:26,013
A lovely baby.
He looks just like you.

421
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:30,983
Is that so?

422
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:38,390
Is His Lordship pleased?

423
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:41,996
He's delighted.

424
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:48,336
I was so unhappy

425
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:50,769
when I was
first brought here.

426
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:53,935
But now
that I've given birth...

427
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:58,740
No, you must say you were
"allowed to give birth."

428
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:01,474
Now that I've been
allowed to give birth,

429
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:04,643
I feel for the first time
that this is my home.

430
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:07,415
His Lordship must be...

431
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:10,386
Oh, pardon me.

432
00:52:20,604 --> 00:52:24,540
Nothing could be
more auspicious for the clan.

433
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:27,039
You have done well.

434
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:34,010
Where are you taking my...
I mean, the infant heir?

435
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:35,844
I'm going to nurse him.

436
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:37,679
Nurse him?

437
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:41,984
But I can nurse him myself.

438
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,770
Thank you.

439
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:06,138
I'll make a tidy profit
with this satin.

440
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:14,356
You're worried
about payment, aren't you?

441
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:15,855
Relax.

442
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,893
I have Lord Matsudaira's
30,000 <i>koku</i> backing me up.

443
00:53:19,062 --> 00:53:21,997
My master's very strict
about these things.

444
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:23,962
You mean Kahei?

445
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:27,860
Listen, my daughter
just gave birth

446
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,097
to the heir to the clan.

447
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:33,936
You look surprised.
He'll inherit those 30,000 <i>koku.</i>

448
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,771
Heir to the clan?

449
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:38,545
Word arrived
the day before yesterday.

450
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:47,788
Money is no object.

451
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:51,257
Bring me the finest you have,
and lots of it.

452
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:53,655
Congratulations.

453
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:55,463
Look.

454
00:53:56,766 --> 00:53:59,701
It seems
your worries are over.

455
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:02,337
Shall I bring out
the <i>habutae</i> silk?

456
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:05,406
- Don't be hasty.
- Bring out everything.

457
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:08,305
I'm opening a shop
on Muromachi Avenue.

458
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:12,038
I want it to rival Sasaya's store,
so show me everything.

459
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:20,447
What's happened
to the concubine?

460
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:25,454
His Lordship's love for her
has grown since she gave birth.

461
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:26,959
What's wrong with that?

462
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:28,687
It's just that

463
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:32,129
he seems to grow weaker
by the day.

464
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:33,859
The doctor says

465
00:54:34,037 --> 00:54:36,130
if she continues
to share his bed,

466
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:39,240
it may shorten his life.

467
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:41,172
We can't let that happen.

468
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:43,938
The heir has been born.
She's of no further use.

469
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,446
Isn't that right, Isobe?

470
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:49,980
For the sake of the clan,
send her home.

471
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:55,248
- But...
- Do it.

472
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,060
She was dismissed?

473
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:38,357
Are you sure?

474
00:55:41,304 --> 00:55:43,272
I don't know what to say.

475
00:55:44,407 --> 00:55:46,637
When she gave birth,

476
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:50,210
I was filled
with happiness and pride.

477
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:53,411
I'm very sorry.

478
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:42,355
So now you're back.

479
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:47,292
After you bore the lord an heir,

480
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:53,403
you should have
withheld your affections a bit.

481
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:06,482
Anyway, too late now.

482
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:09,648
How much
did they give you?

483
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:14,227
Three hundred <i>ryo</i>
would be a great help.

484
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:23,004
Just five <i>ryo?</i>

485
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:39,748
I thought you'd be rich.

486
00:57:40,323 --> 00:57:43,383
I bought
a huge amount of fabric.

487
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:47,357
Now I'm deep in debt.

488
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,292
For our sake,

489
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,768
work in Shimabara
as a courtesan.

490
00:57:56,005 --> 00:58:00,806
I'll buy your freedom
when I sell the fabric.

491
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:05,670
You mean you'd actually
sell your own daughter?

492
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:08,510
There's no other choice.

493
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:13,621
After everything
she's been through...

494
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:15,916
and now this!

495
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:17,853
Welcome.

496
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,789
I've always wanted

497
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:25,155
to live it up in Shimabara
at least once before I die.

498
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:27,853
I've risen
every day at dawn

499
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:32,364
and worked hard until the stars
came out in the sky.

500
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,696
It must be 20 years

501
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:38,363
that I've been saving
my money.

502
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:41,408
I think I've finally
saved enough,

503
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:45,275
so I've come
all the way from Echigo.

504
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:47,806
Unfortunately

505
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:51,420
we're full at the moment.
- Are you turning me away?

506
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:56,051
You're all
as pretty as a picture!

507
00:59:56,392 --> 00:59:58,019
Pardon me, sir,

508
00:59:58,227 --> 01:00:01,993
but this is a particularly
expensive establishment.

509
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:04,860
Do you have
a letter of introduction?

510
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:06,558
All righty.

511
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:10,604
If it's money you want...
here's what I got.

512
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,741
Enough to fill a five-quart container.
Is that enough?

513
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:16,174
More than enough!

514
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,313
Welcome, sir.
I'm the owner here.

515
01:00:20,516 --> 01:00:23,110
Is that so?
So you'll let me stay?

516
01:00:24,187 --> 01:00:27,213
Prepare our largest room

517
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:30,119
and lay out our finest food.

518
01:00:30,326 --> 01:00:32,692
Call for Shizuhata.

519
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,658
Hurry!

520
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:39,163
Thank you for honoring us
with your presence.

521
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:41,667
See that my men
have a good time too.

522
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:43,601
They've come a long way.

523
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:45,764
Your packhorse drivers?
As you wish, sir.

524
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:48,068
Hey, welcome them inside!

525
01:00:48,277 --> 01:00:50,336
I have some sake
on my horse.

526
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:53,243
Sir, we serve
the very best sake.

527
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:56,213
Thank you.

528
01:01:43,633 --> 01:01:44,827
Shizuhata...

529
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:49,734
our finest courtesan.

530
01:01:49,939 --> 01:01:53,932
All right,
let's liven things up a bit!

531
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:20,101
Hey, why aren't you
picking them up?

532
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:21,634
Here.

533
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:25,098
Hey!
Where are your manners?

534
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:28,069
It's he who has
no manners.

535
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:30,802
I'm not a beggar.

536
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:32,813
Wait!

537
01:02:33,015 --> 01:02:35,950
Stop!
Come back here!

538
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:48,596
Just a minute.

539
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:50,823
What do you think
your job is?

540
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,865
Think you're too good
to be here?

541
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:56,971
You're not here
for your own enjoyment.

542
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:00,937
Constantly carrying on
about your pedigree!

543
01:03:02,078 --> 01:03:04,911
For all I know, you could be
a ragpicker's daughter.

544
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:08,675
How dare you suggest
such a thing!

545
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:11,012
You're bought and paid for.

546
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:15,020
You're no different
from a fish on a chopping board.

547
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:18,259
We can serve you up
any way we like.

548
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,986
He offered you money.
What's wrong with that?

549
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:27,901
Fine, then.

550
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:32,198
Never come back here again.

551
01:03:32,441 --> 01:03:35,103
What will your master
say to that?

552
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:37,436
If I dismiss you,

553
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:41,515
no one in these parts
will hire you as a courtesan.

554
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:44,648
Now get out.

555
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:53,391
It was all my fault.

556
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:58,466
I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.

557
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:02,662
I'll try to do better
from now on.

558
01:04:02,872 --> 01:04:04,737
But please
don't tell my master.

559
01:04:04,941 --> 01:04:07,239
It's too late now.
Get out.

560
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:10,742
Master, the big spender
is calling for her.

561
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:13,381
I'll give him
someone better.

562
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:17,280
No, he says
he likes this one.

563
01:04:17,486 --> 01:04:20,250
He's never known a girl
who refused money.

564
01:04:20,456 --> 01:04:23,323
He wants to buy her
and take her home.

565
01:04:23,492 --> 01:04:25,016
Buy her?

566
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:31,533
You heard her.

567
01:04:31,734 --> 01:04:34,328
He wants to buy you
and take you to Echigo.

568
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:37,404
Please put on a happy face
and serve him.

569
01:04:37,573 --> 01:04:39,666
Let's go.

570
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:45,579
He's buying your freedom.

571
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:06,393
Be nice to him, please.

572
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,409
Will you really
buy my freedom

573
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,479
and take me to Echigo?

574
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:20,548
Yes, I'll take care of you.

575
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:24,277
Actually, I came
to Kyoto to find a wife.

576
01:05:24,453 --> 01:05:26,887
I won't go back without one.

577
01:05:27,056 --> 01:05:29,024
Will you join me?

578
01:05:31,127 --> 01:05:33,891
If your feelings are genuine,

579
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:37,825
I'll serve you faithfully.

580
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:46,231
Why are you laughing?

581
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:48,904
Money.

582
01:05:50,379 --> 01:05:52,074
Money!

583
01:05:53,516 --> 01:05:56,679
As long as I have money,

584
01:05:56,852 --> 01:05:59,116
I can have
anything in the world.

585
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:04,489
People see money
and their eyes gleam.

586
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:06,594
They crawl on all fours.

587
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:10,960
Even a haughty woman like you
smiles and sidles up to me.

588
01:06:12,068 --> 01:06:16,164
You think I'm greedy,
but I'm not.

589
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:20,800
I want to be
with you because...

590
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:24,537
Because everyone has a price,
and this is yours.

591
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:27,239
Thanks to this money,

592
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:29,577
your fortune has turned.

593
01:06:29,885 --> 01:06:31,978
Lord Money!

594
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:34,714
Almighty Money!

595
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:46,167
You fraud!

596
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,796
No wonder
you spend so freely!

597
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,996
He's a counterfeiter!

598
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:53,004
Your money is bogus!

599
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:55,200
You'll be beheaded!

600
01:06:55,411 --> 01:06:57,038
Come quietly!

601
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:13,561
Don't resist!

602
01:07:15,731 --> 01:07:16,857
Fool!

603
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,127
You're under arrest!

604
01:07:53,169 --> 01:07:54,796
Please...

605
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:57,239
try to smile.

606
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,908
I'm begging you.

607
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:04,201
You're our daughter again.

608
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:08,845
You don't know
how I've waited

609
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:13,648
for the day you'd return to us
from Shimabara.

610
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:22,691
We won't cause you
any more suffering.

611
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:27,965
Please forgive us and smile.

612
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:30,138
Welcome.

613
01:08:33,209 --> 01:08:39,409
<i>My sad fate</i>

614
01:08:56,699 --> 01:09:05,539
<i>Is pitiful indeed</i>

615
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:14,647
Where did you learn
that song?

616
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:16,614
It's so beautiful.

617
01:09:16,785 --> 01:09:19,310
You must be
an accomplished singer.

618
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:21,986
I'm so ashamed.

619
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:27,061
Back when there were
pleasure quarters in Rokujo,

620
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:31,029
I was a courtesan
named Katsuragi.

621
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,299
Take care of yourself.

622
01:09:40,876 --> 01:09:42,639
Thank you.

623
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:54,516
Here you are.

624
01:09:58,928 --> 01:10:02,921
<i>My pillow is soaked</i>

625
01:10:08,404 --> 01:10:10,736
<i>With tears</i>

626
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:21,879
I'm glad you came.

627
01:10:22,084 --> 01:10:25,019
You were once
Lord Matsudaira's concubine.

628
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,247
I'm hesitant
to ask for your help.

629
01:10:28,457 --> 01:10:31,153
Please don't feel that way.

630
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:34,796
Try to think of me
as your sister.

631
01:10:34,964 --> 01:10:37,990
We'll treat you well
while you're here

632
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:40,465
and find you
a good husband.

633
01:10:40,669 --> 01:10:42,261
I'm very grateful.

634
01:10:42,471 --> 01:10:45,736
My wife has few relatives,

635
01:10:45,941 --> 01:10:48,171
so please be
a good friend to her.

636
01:10:48,344 --> 01:10:50,335
May I have
a word with her?

637
01:11:16,071 --> 01:11:20,804
I must ask you
something right away.

638
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:22,500
Will you hear me out?

639
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:24,245
What is it?

640
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:38,121
Please write a solemn oath

641
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:43,060
never to reveal
my secret to anyone.

642
01:11:43,599 --> 01:11:45,692
Why would I ever
reveal your secret?

643
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:47,801
Please, just do it.

644
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:10,217
Thank you very much.

645
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:14,052
Now, how may I serve you?

646
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:19,592
There's only one thing
I'll ever ask you to do:

647
01:12:19,935 --> 01:12:24,167
Will you please
dress and style my hair?

648
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:27,173
I expected you
to ask much more.

649
01:12:27,376 --> 01:12:29,867
Then you'll do it?
I'm so glad.

650
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:33,043
The woman I had doing it

651
01:12:33,248 --> 01:12:36,513
suddenly
became indisposed.

652
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:39,643
I'm not very good at it,

653
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:42,323
but I can try.

654
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:46,385
The thing is,
my hair's so...

655
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:49,424
Your hair is beautiful.

656
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:51,496
No, it's not.

657
01:12:57,172 --> 01:12:58,799
Come with me.

658
01:13:49,324 --> 01:13:52,885
I was seriously ill last year.

659
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:57,389
This is what
it did to my hair.

660
01:14:00,235 --> 01:14:02,897
I made this wig

661
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:05,938
while recuperating
at my parents' home.

662
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:11,769
I've tried
to keep it a secret.

663
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:16,810
I'm terrified that
my husband will find out.

664
01:14:16,985 --> 01:14:19,385
He'd be revolted.

665
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:23,717
Please don't tell him.

666
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:28,324
I promise I won't.

667
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:05,689
Having your hair dressed?

668
01:15:05,901 --> 01:15:09,302
Very nicely done.

669
01:15:09,471 --> 01:15:11,302
Oharu's quite good.

670
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,372
She did it for you?

671
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:16,202
Dear...

672
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:19,312
what would you say
to adopting Oharu

673
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:22,075
and finding her
a nice husband?

674
01:15:22,284 --> 01:15:23,342
Certainly.

675
01:15:23,552 --> 01:15:25,577
Perhaps a man
from your store?

676
01:15:25,787 --> 01:15:28,915
No, there's nobody
good enough here.

677
01:15:36,431 --> 01:15:37,921
Pardon me.

678
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:40,498
What is it?

679
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:43,967
Shall I send the bill
to the customer?

680
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:46,003
Ask Jihei. He knows.

681
01:15:46,642 --> 01:15:48,439
What are you looking at?

682
01:15:49,478 --> 01:15:51,241
I'll do that.

683
01:16:03,859 --> 01:16:05,486
Now what?

684
01:16:05,694 --> 01:16:08,162
What about the turmeric
salesman's bill?

685
01:16:08,363 --> 01:16:11,059
Don't ask me.
Ask Jihei.

686
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:13,224
You're getting on my nerves.

687
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:15,165
Fine. I'll go
to the shop myself.

688
01:16:16,538 --> 01:16:18,506
What are you staring at?

689
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:26,546
Bunkichi,
stop staring and hurry up!

690
01:16:28,283 --> 01:16:30,979
- Welcome.
- Good day.

691
01:16:31,286 --> 01:16:32,776
Oh, you're here.

692
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:35,081
What a rare treat.
Please come in.

693
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:37,350
- Sorry I haven't been in touch.
- Not at all.

694
01:16:37,526 --> 01:16:40,427
Bring some tea.
- Please don't bother.

695
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:44,498
Looks like business is booming.
- I wouldn't go that far.

696
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:50,200
Oharu, please make
some tea for our guest.

697
01:17:03,318 --> 01:17:05,752
Shall I take it in for you?

698
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:07,444
No, thank you.

699
01:17:09,758 --> 01:17:12,921
May I observe you?

700
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:15,626
You're making me nervous.

701
01:17:23,171 --> 01:17:24,900
You do it so well.

702
01:17:25,507 --> 01:17:28,032
Stop that.
Get away from me.

703
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:48,391
I just can't make
any money these days.

704
01:17:48,597 --> 01:17:50,963
- I hear you do.
- Nonsense.

705
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:53,498
People like to talk.

706
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:57,431
Thank you.

707
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:02,275
It's you!

708
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:07,346
I didn't know you were here.

709
01:18:07,549 --> 01:18:10,882
Won't you wait a moment?

710
01:18:11,253 --> 01:18:12,811
Wait!

711
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:14,613
You know her?

712
01:18:15,757 --> 01:18:17,349
What's she doing here?

713
01:18:17,559 --> 01:18:19,891
I'm taking care of her.

714
01:18:20,095 --> 01:18:23,292
You make it sound so noble.

715
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:25,557
What on earth do you mean?

716
01:18:25,767 --> 01:18:28,258
Don't play innocent.
You bought her, right?

717
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:29,596
Bought her?

718
01:18:29,805 --> 01:18:31,966
She's a Shimabara courtesan.

719
01:18:32,174 --> 01:18:33,607
Shimabara?

720
01:18:34,109 --> 01:18:37,306
Shimabara,
as in the pleasure quarter?

721
01:18:37,612 --> 01:18:39,671
Where else?

722
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:57,794
So when Hishiya told you,
that was the first you'd heard of it?

723
01:18:57,999 --> 01:18:59,432
Yes.

724
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:02,562
You knew before,
didn't you?

725
01:19:03,605 --> 01:19:05,869
That's why you took her in.

726
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:09,207
Don't be absurd.

727
01:19:16,118 --> 01:19:18,450
You sent her
to Lord Matsudaira.

728
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:20,212
You must have known.

729
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:22,253
I didn't know.
I was shocked.

730
01:19:22,457 --> 01:19:24,755
You saw her at Shimabara,
didn't you?

731
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:26,925
What are you talking about?

732
01:19:27,129 --> 01:19:29,495
I've never even been
to Shimabara.

733
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:33,464
You think I'd waste
good money in a place like that?

734
01:19:33,668 --> 01:19:37,764
I'm so tight I step carefully
so I don't damage my sandals!

735
01:19:38,106 --> 01:19:39,164
You're lying!

736
01:19:39,374 --> 01:19:40,932
Stop this!

737
01:19:41,143 --> 01:19:42,405
<i>Excuse me.</i>

738
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:44,044
What is it?

739
01:19:44,646 --> 01:19:47,615
- A letter from the money exchange.
- I see.

740
01:19:59,361 --> 01:20:01,056
Be careful!

741
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:04,766
Watch what you're doing!

742
01:20:25,787 --> 01:20:27,277
Cut your hair.

743
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:29,820
Your hair... cut it!

744
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:31,617
Why?

745
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:34,958
You plan to use
your beautiful hair...

746
01:20:36,398 --> 01:20:38,889
to steal my husband away!

747
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:40,727
I heard all about it.

748
01:20:40,902 --> 01:20:43,302
I know all about your past.

749
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:46,099
You lied to me.

750
01:20:46,308 --> 01:20:48,538
I apologize.
But I swear I never...

751
01:20:48,743 --> 01:20:50,734
Cut it. Cut it!

752
01:20:50,946 --> 01:20:53,676
Cut it! Go on!

753
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:27,238
That's not enough.
Cut off more!

754
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:29,508
Please don't, madam!

755
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:31,549
Cut it!

756
01:21:31,753 --> 01:21:34,916
If you don't cut it, I will!

757
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:41,361
I'll cut it off.
Just watch me.

758
01:22:03,785 --> 01:22:04,877
Good morning.

759
01:22:05,086 --> 01:22:07,850
Oharu,
where did my wife go?

760
01:22:08,023 --> 01:22:10,048
To the cemetery.

761
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:11,725
I see.

762
01:22:12,527 --> 01:22:14,256
Oharu...

763
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:19,359
you're a naughty girl.
I heard all about your past.

764
01:22:19,868 --> 01:22:21,460
I'm sorry.

765
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:13,746
I'm not scolding you.

766
01:23:16,891 --> 01:23:22,124
I'll bet you had
some fun times, eh?

767
01:23:24,632 --> 01:23:28,090
One would never guess
just looking at your face.

768
01:23:28,303 --> 01:23:33,206
But you really liked doing
those dirty things, didn't you?

769
01:23:33,475 --> 01:23:35,807
That's how you twisted
Lord Matsudaira

770
01:23:35,977 --> 01:23:37,877
around your little finger.

771
01:23:38,046 --> 01:23:40,241
I did no such thing.

772
01:23:41,082 --> 01:23:43,073
It's all right.

773
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:45,676
I understand completely.

774
01:23:45,887 --> 01:23:49,254
You can relax
and be yourself around me.

775
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:56,054
I can enjoy
a top courtesan...

776
01:23:58,099 --> 01:24:01,398
and not even
have to pay for it.

777
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:03,494
Calm down!

778
01:24:21,256 --> 01:24:25,454
Remember this smell.

779
01:24:31,633 --> 01:24:33,157
All right?

780
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:28,514
What's wrong?

781
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:34,826
My hair!

782
01:25:36,764 --> 01:25:38,288
Where are you going?

783
01:25:40,268 --> 01:25:41,496
Oharu!

784
01:25:41,703 --> 01:25:45,264
It was you!
You did this to my hair!

785
01:25:49,344 --> 01:25:51,369
It's nothing.

786
01:25:51,546 --> 01:25:53,411
Go back to bed.

787
01:25:53,581 --> 01:25:55,776
She's just mumbling
in her sleep.

788
01:26:01,389 --> 01:26:03,118
Here you are.

789
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:14,630
- More?
- No, thank you.

790
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:39,355
Don't worry.

791
01:26:40,295 --> 01:26:42,855
It's too soon to despair.

792
01:26:43,064 --> 01:26:45,999
If one god forsakes you,
another will save you.

793
01:26:46,634 --> 01:26:50,297
Yakichi here works in the fan shop.
He's singled you out.

794
01:26:52,173 --> 01:26:57,270
His boss is going
to help him

795
01:26:57,478 --> 01:26:59,776
set up his own shop.

796
01:27:00,782 --> 01:27:05,219
He's asking
for your hand in marriage.

797
01:27:05,787 --> 01:27:09,245
I think
I'll excuse myself now.

798
01:27:09,457 --> 01:27:11,789
What about your proposal?

799
01:27:11,993 --> 01:27:14,223
Perhaps you could
discuss that with Oharu.

800
01:27:20,735 --> 01:27:22,828
Look how naive he is.

801
01:27:24,572 --> 01:27:27,336
I hear he's devoted
to his work.

802
01:27:27,542 --> 01:27:30,375
He's never once been
to the pleasure quarters.

803
01:27:30,979 --> 01:27:33,379
You couldn't hope

804
01:27:33,548 --> 01:27:36,142
for a happier life
than as his wife.

805
01:27:36,317 --> 01:27:39,411
I'm hardly worthy
of such a man.

806
01:27:39,854 --> 01:27:42,721
After all, my past...

807
01:27:43,458 --> 01:27:45,358
He knows all about you.

808
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:49,860
We told him everything.
Didn't hide a single detail.

809
01:27:50,064 --> 01:27:52,032
He said,

810
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,464
"I don't mind.

811
01:27:54,669 --> 01:27:58,935
I want to make that poor,
unlucky girl happy."

812
01:27:59,173 --> 01:28:01,607
He's in love with you.

813
01:28:29,537 --> 01:28:32,768
- Going out so early?
- Yes. I won't be long.

814
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:36,273
You were up late last night
working on the books.

815
01:28:36,477 --> 01:28:39,310
Yes, it was nearly dawn
when I finished.

816
01:28:39,847 --> 01:28:41,439
I'm quite sleepy.

817
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:44,345
Why don't you rest
for a while?

818
01:28:44,852 --> 01:28:47,184
I have to deliver these today.

819
01:28:47,388 --> 01:28:48,946
Really?

820
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:51,557
I'll buy a sash for you
on the way home.

821
01:28:51,759 --> 01:28:53,954
How nice!
Thank you!

822
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:56,653
Wait a minute.

823
01:29:00,501 --> 01:29:02,230
Face this way.

824
01:29:07,275 --> 01:29:09,743
Perfect.

825
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:11,941
Hurry back.

826
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:18,610
<i>Excuse me.</i>

827
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:20,253
Welcome.

828
01:29:20,455 --> 01:29:23,424
I'd like a dancing fan
for my daughter.

829
01:29:23,624 --> 01:29:26,184
Certainly.

830
01:29:27,462 --> 01:29:29,487
It's very hot today.

831
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:38,666
These are some of our best.

832
01:29:38,873 --> 01:29:40,636
I see.

833
01:29:43,778 --> 01:29:46,508
You have a lovely shop.

834
01:29:47,014 --> 01:29:48,447
Thank you.

835
01:29:48,950 --> 01:29:52,977
You should marry soon
and run a shop like this.

836
01:29:54,522 --> 01:29:58,014
Running an honest business
is a good life, isn't it?

837
01:30:00,361 --> 01:30:02,761
Your husband
has accomplished much

838
01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:04,864
at such a young age.

839
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:07,694
He's just an honest,
hardworking man.

840
01:30:07,869 --> 01:30:09,666
I envy you.

841
01:30:10,571 --> 01:30:13,062
You're so pretty.

842
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:15,937
You two make
an ideal couple.

843
01:30:18,012 --> 01:30:19,775
Any children?

844
01:30:20,381 --> 01:30:21,905
Not yet.

845
01:30:22,116 --> 01:30:23,777
Is that so?

846
01:30:46,107 --> 01:30:48,974
- Madam!
- What is it?

847
01:30:49,177 --> 01:30:50,576
Awful news!

848
01:30:50,745 --> 01:30:52,269
It's your husband!

849
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:54,210
What's happened?

850
01:31:21,209 --> 01:31:24,372
He was probably killed
by a robber.

851
01:31:25,213 --> 01:31:27,875
He died clutching this sash.

852
01:31:35,890 --> 01:31:37,448
Yakichi!

853
01:32:44,425 --> 01:32:47,826
A handsome youth at morn

854
01:32:47,995 --> 01:32:50,862
is by dusk a heap of bones.

855
01:32:51,532 --> 01:32:56,595
All is truly impermanent
in this world.

856
01:32:58,506 --> 01:33:03,876
What do you plan
to do now?

857
01:33:04,245 --> 01:33:08,147
My late husband's uncle

858
01:33:08,316 --> 01:33:10,978
sold the shop.

859
01:33:11,819 --> 01:33:14,117
Where does that leave you?

860
01:33:14,322 --> 01:33:16,620
I'm going back
to my parents.

861
01:33:18,526 --> 01:33:22,485
Did he leave you anything
to remember him by?

862
01:33:22,697 --> 01:33:24,927
No, nothing.

863
01:33:25,099 --> 01:33:26,293
Nothing?

864
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:29,492
I don't need anything.

865
01:33:29,704 --> 01:33:34,334
I want to become a nun
and serve Buddha.

866
01:33:35,042 --> 01:33:36,509
A nun?

867
01:33:36,711 --> 01:33:39,111
Please show me the way!

868
01:33:53,394 --> 01:33:55,225
Bunkichi?

869
01:33:56,964 --> 01:33:58,397
Hey, where's Bunkichi?

870
01:33:58,599 --> 01:34:00,226
<i>Here I am.</i>

871
01:34:06,507 --> 01:34:08,566
Look at this.

872
01:34:10,211 --> 01:34:13,180
Who's this charge account for?

873
01:34:15,616 --> 01:34:18,346
An acquaintance of mine.

874
01:34:18,552 --> 01:34:22,613
I've told you repeatedly:
We don't extend credit.

875
01:34:22,823 --> 01:34:26,156
This is unacceptable.
Go collect the money tomorrow.

876
01:34:27,261 --> 01:34:30,697
Can't it wait a month?

877
01:34:30,898 --> 01:34:34,095
No.
If it's too awkward for you,

878
01:34:34,268 --> 01:34:35,792
I'll go myself.

879
01:34:36,003 --> 01:34:37,698
Where is he?

880
01:34:39,373 --> 01:34:41,170
You refuse to tell me?

881
01:34:43,177 --> 01:34:44,769
You won't tell me?

882
01:35:14,675 --> 01:35:16,108
Excuse me.

883
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:18,073
Jihei!

884
01:35:18,279 --> 01:35:21,043
It's been such a long time.

885
01:35:21,248 --> 01:35:22,840
You're incorrigible,

886
01:35:23,017 --> 01:35:26,043
luring poor Bunkichi
to a place like this.

887
01:35:26,253 --> 01:35:28,448
What do you mean?

888
01:35:28,656 --> 01:35:31,750
He heard I was here

889
01:35:31,959 --> 01:35:34,689
and kindly brought me
some fabric.

890
01:35:34,895 --> 01:35:39,594
Fine. I'm here to collect
for what he gave you on credit.

891
01:35:43,904 --> 01:35:46,429
If you don't have the money,
return the fabric.

892
01:35:48,976 --> 01:35:51,274
I already made it
into a kimono.

893
01:35:51,445 --> 01:35:53,174
Already?

894
01:35:55,216 --> 01:35:58,811
In that case,
I'll take the kimono.

895
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:02,917
Jihei, you and I
aren't strangers.

896
01:36:03,124 --> 01:36:06,651
How can you be so cold?
Here you go.

897
01:36:07,628 --> 01:36:09,027
Cold?

898
01:36:10,331 --> 01:36:12,196
I'm not Bunkichi.

899
01:36:12,366 --> 01:36:14,857
I can't be seduced
by a whore like you,

900
01:36:15,035 --> 01:36:16,662
so pay up.

901
01:36:16,837 --> 01:36:18,702
What did you call me?

902
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:21,301
Fine, I'll return it.

903
01:36:22,510 --> 01:36:24,501
Is that the kimono
you made?

904
01:36:28,616 --> 01:36:30,243
And the sash too.

905
01:36:34,288 --> 01:36:36,222
No need to undress.

906
01:36:37,725 --> 01:36:39,317
Here's the kimono.

907
01:36:51,705 --> 01:36:53,536
Now hurry up and leave.

908
01:37:20,668 --> 01:37:23,637
This is going to take
longer than I thought.

909
01:37:25,039 --> 01:37:26,870
Take this money...

910
01:37:28,542 --> 01:37:30,669
and get yourself
some tea and cake.

911
01:37:30,845 --> 01:37:34,281
Drink as much tea
as you can, okay?

912
01:37:37,284 --> 01:37:38,774
Understand?

913
01:38:07,014 --> 01:38:10,245
Oharu,
you must be very tired.

914
01:38:39,046 --> 01:38:40,604
Please leave!

915
01:38:40,781 --> 01:38:43,682
I don't want to see your face.
Leave at once!

916
01:38:44,852 --> 01:38:47,446
I'm not the kind of woman
you think.

917
01:38:47,621 --> 01:38:50,283
He was trying to rape me.

918
01:38:50,457 --> 01:38:53,722
Please believe me, sister.
I beg of you!

919
01:38:55,496 --> 01:38:58,863
I really believed
you wanted to become a nun.

920
01:38:59,266 --> 01:39:01,860
You were just making
a fool of me.

921
01:39:04,405 --> 01:39:08,739
Did you really think
you could get away with it?

922
01:39:10,544 --> 01:39:13,138
What kind of person are you?

923
01:39:22,489 --> 01:39:24,286
Get out!

924
01:39:25,526 --> 01:39:28,222
Get out!

925
01:41:00,721 --> 01:41:02,313
Oharu.

926
01:41:05,125 --> 01:41:06,786
What's the matter?

927
01:41:06,994 --> 01:41:09,724
I've been driven
out of the temple.

928
01:41:10,097 --> 01:41:12,827
What? You too?

929
01:41:17,104 --> 01:41:20,631
I was dismissed too.

930
01:41:20,941 --> 01:41:22,909
You were?

931
01:41:37,124 --> 01:41:41,288
Oharu, come with me.
I know I can make you happy.

932
01:41:41,495 --> 01:41:43,292
What?

933
01:41:43,497 --> 01:41:45,021
Don't worry about money.

934
01:41:45,199 --> 01:41:49,260
When I left,
I stole 50 <i>ryo</i> in gold.

935
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:52,299
What? Bunkichi!

936
01:41:52,506 --> 01:41:54,997
They all think I ran off
with you anyway.

937
01:41:55,209 --> 01:41:58,508
No! I won't go
with a thief like you.

938
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:00,573
I can't! No!

939
01:42:21,201 --> 01:42:22,998
Would you like some?

940
01:42:23,203 --> 01:42:25,103
It's very good.

941
01:42:28,542 --> 01:42:30,009
Wait a moment.

942
01:42:33,147 --> 01:42:35,615
How about an egg?

943
01:42:41,622 --> 01:42:43,317
I'm at a loss.

944
01:42:48,128 --> 01:42:50,392
May I have one of these?

945
01:42:50,597 --> 01:42:52,622
Oharu, these are good!

946
01:42:52,799 --> 01:42:54,824
- Bunkichi!
- Jihei!

947
01:42:55,035 --> 01:42:57,833
He's the thief!
Catch him!

948
01:42:58,038 --> 01:43:00,302
Stop! Come back!

949
01:43:02,609 --> 01:43:04,076
Jihei!

950
01:43:07,881 --> 01:43:09,542
Stop!

951
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:11,741
Please let him go!

952
01:43:11,952 --> 01:43:13,783
Out of the way!

953
01:43:14,354 --> 01:43:16,322
- Oharu!
- You wench!

954
01:43:16,757 --> 01:43:19,624
Go off somewhere and die,
you rotten whore!

955
01:43:20,127 --> 01:43:22,857
Oharu!

956
01:43:40,647 --> 01:43:45,914
<i>This fleeting world</i>

957
01:43:47,688 --> 01:43:53,217
<i>Is full of pain</i>

958
01:44:03,270 --> 01:44:09,573
<i>And I, oh I

959
01:44:24,124 --> 01:44:31,496
<i>Am a thing of pity</i>

960
01:44:32,966 --> 01:44:38,199
<i>This life</i>

961
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:43,702
<i>So full of regrets</i>

962
01:45:08,702 --> 01:45:15,471
<i>Will vanish</i>

963
01:45:18,545 --> 01:45:22,606
<i>Like the morning dew</i>

964
01:49:27,594 --> 01:49:29,858
What's the matter?

965
01:49:31,231 --> 01:49:32,721
What's wrong?

966
01:49:34,968 --> 01:49:38,802
Come along with us
and take a rest.

967
01:49:39,005 --> 01:49:41,200
Yes, let's go.

968
01:49:42,475 --> 01:49:44,375
Come along.

969
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:55,888
I'll carry it for you.

970
01:50:00,393 --> 01:50:02,861
I'll get that too.

971
01:50:40,867 --> 01:50:43,665
She hasn't eaten
in three days,

972
01:50:44,037 --> 01:50:46,301
and she's chilled
to the bone.

973
01:50:47,841 --> 01:50:50,071
Help yourself to the food.

974
01:50:53,847 --> 01:50:57,112
Your hair's turned
really gray.

975
01:50:57,851 --> 01:50:59,614
Yes, it has.

976
01:50:59,786 --> 01:51:02,653
Here we are,
covered with wrinkles...

977
01:51:04,090 --> 01:51:07,059
yet we try to coo
like young maidens:

978
01:51:07,227 --> 01:51:10,856
"Hey there, handsome!"

979
01:51:13,833 --> 01:51:16,358
What nerve we have!

980
01:51:34,921 --> 01:51:37,481
You wanna earn
some money too?

981
01:51:38,925 --> 01:51:41,018
It'll take your mind off things.

982
01:51:41,828 --> 01:51:46,162
I'm too old for that,
unlike you.

983
01:51:47,967 --> 01:51:50,902
Listen to her,
acting all innocent!

984
01:51:51,104 --> 01:51:53,197
It's a pitiful life we lead,

985
01:51:53,373 --> 01:51:57,400
but nobody's
going to help us out.

986
01:51:57,610 --> 01:51:59,271
Ain't that the truth!

987
01:51:59,612 --> 01:52:03,207
It would be easier just to die,
but we can't even do that.

988
01:52:03,383 --> 01:52:07,376
Drink the sake while we have it.
It'll lift your spirits.

989
01:52:07,854 --> 01:52:10,618
We've fallen this far.

990
01:52:10,790 --> 01:52:13,156
Might as well do
what we want.

991
01:52:14,594 --> 01:52:17,119
I can get you some clothes.

992
01:52:17,697 --> 01:52:19,528
What do you say?

993
01:52:19,733 --> 01:52:21,132
Come on.

994
01:52:21,301 --> 01:52:24,168
Whatever we do,
the world's not about to change.

995
01:52:24,370 --> 01:52:26,167
That's right!

996
01:52:35,148 --> 01:52:38,709
Old man,
we've got a newcomer.

997
01:52:38,918 --> 01:52:40,681
Bring her something to wear.

998
01:53:08,581 --> 01:53:10,208
Are you the newcomer?

999
01:53:11,017 --> 01:53:13,542
You could probably
make good money.

1000
01:53:15,088 --> 01:53:17,488
I'll rent you a kimono
and undergarments

1001
01:53:17,657 --> 01:53:19,488
for three <i>bu</i> a night.

1002
01:53:19,659 --> 01:53:22,355
A sash and socks
will be one <i>bu.</i>

1003
01:53:22,562 --> 01:53:25,156
Footwear will be five <i>mon.</i>

1004
01:53:28,201 --> 01:53:30,465
This is so gaudy.

1005
01:53:31,938 --> 01:53:34,202
What's wrong with it?

1006
01:53:34,407 --> 01:53:37,638
You can't make money
if they don't notice you.

1007
01:53:39,045 --> 01:53:41,809
I expect payment soon,

1008
01:53:41,981 --> 01:53:43,949
so hurry up and get to work.

1009
01:53:45,718 --> 01:53:48,016
If you're done here,
go away.

1010
01:53:48,221 --> 01:53:49,916
Nasty old man.

1011
01:53:53,927 --> 01:53:57,124
Come on.
I'll help you get dressed.

1012
01:54:43,910 --> 01:54:47,141
Hey, mister, wait a minute.

1013
01:54:49,148 --> 01:54:52,675
Why don't we have some fun?

1014
01:54:54,487 --> 01:54:56,352
Old hag! Are you crazy?

1015
01:55:22,215 --> 01:55:24,274
Hey, handsome!

1016
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:29,320
Come on,
let's have some fun.

1017
01:55:29,522 --> 01:55:30,580
Go away!

1018
01:55:30,757 --> 01:55:33,453
- I'll give you your money's worth!
- I said no!

1019
01:56:37,256 --> 01:56:41,022
Madam, would you come
with me for a moment?

1020
01:56:41,928 --> 01:56:45,022
Certainly.

1021
01:56:57,944 --> 01:57:00,378
Come in.

1022
01:57:04,150 --> 01:57:05,981
Sit down over there.

1023
01:57:16,062 --> 01:57:18,053
Cold, isn't it?

1024
01:57:33,212 --> 01:57:35,737
Shall I sing you a song?

1025
01:57:41,220 --> 01:57:44,348
Is there something wrong?

1026
01:57:44,991 --> 01:57:48,358
Your silence
makes me uneasy.

1027
01:57:48,895 --> 01:57:52,023
Don't worry about it.

1028
01:57:52,231 --> 01:57:54,392
You can just sit there.

1029
01:57:58,571 --> 01:58:01,096
Please drop the fake voice.

1030
01:58:01,307 --> 01:58:04,071
I'd really prefer it

1031
01:58:04,277 --> 01:58:06,711
if you spoke
in your natural voice.

1032
01:58:08,381 --> 01:58:11,441
Come this way.

1033
01:58:30,336 --> 01:58:33,635
Everybody
take a good long look.

1034
01:58:45,685 --> 01:58:47,152
You see that?

1035
01:58:47,787 --> 01:58:51,416
You still want to sleep
with women now?

1036
01:58:54,460 --> 01:58:58,123
You all want happiness
in the next world.

1037
01:58:58,331 --> 01:59:02,324
That's why you're on
the Thirty-three Temple Pilgrimage.

1038
01:59:03,202 --> 01:59:04,965
However...

1039
01:59:05,838 --> 01:59:10,775
if you'd rather steep yourself
in the impermanence of earthly life,

1040
01:59:12,078 --> 01:59:14,444
then follow the example

1041
01:59:16,115 --> 01:59:20,415
of this goblin cat
in human form.

1042
01:59:25,258 --> 01:59:29,251
Thank you for coming.
That will be all.

1043
01:59:45,378 --> 01:59:47,175
Now please go.

1044
02:00:21,514 --> 02:00:24,312
When you return
to your homes,

1045
02:00:25,384 --> 02:00:29,912
you can tell everyone
how you met a real goblin cat.

1046
02:01:02,421 --> 02:01:04,616
Thanks a lot.

1047
02:03:02,408 --> 02:03:04,308
What are you doing?

1048
02:03:07,780 --> 02:03:10,044
Looking at a statue
of an arhat.

1049
02:03:12,585 --> 02:03:14,143
It looks like him.

1050
02:03:14,353 --> 02:03:15,911
Like who?

1051
02:03:16,422 --> 02:03:18,686
Think of men you know

1052
02:03:19,525 --> 02:03:22,187
and try to find their faces
among the statues.

1053
02:03:23,162 --> 02:03:25,528
You'll find quite a few.

1054
02:03:45,918 --> 02:03:48,318
She's right!

1055
02:03:48,621 --> 02:03:51,021
They all have
such funny faces!

1056
02:04:47,179 --> 02:04:49,443
Oharu, what's wrong?

1057
02:05:37,229 --> 02:05:40,392
Look, it's your mother.

1058
02:05:40,900 --> 02:05:43,130
I think she's waking up.

1059
02:05:50,309 --> 02:05:54,302
I'm so glad to see you.

1060
02:05:58,817 --> 02:06:00,808
Why have you come?

1061
02:06:01,020 --> 02:06:05,320
Someone told her
they saw you around here.

1062
02:06:05,524 --> 02:06:07,651
She's been looking for you.

1063
02:06:08,093 --> 02:06:11,927
I'm glad
to know you're safe.

1064
02:06:17,403 --> 02:06:19,030
How is Father?

1065
02:06:20,406 --> 02:06:22,374
He passed away.

1066
02:06:23,175 --> 02:06:26,872
He worried about you
to the very end.

1067
02:06:33,118 --> 02:06:35,985
But don't cry.

1068
02:06:37,156 --> 02:06:40,887
You'll find happiness again.

1069
02:06:45,664 --> 02:06:48,292
Me? Happiness?

1070
02:06:49,602 --> 02:06:51,229
It's true.

1071
02:06:52,338 --> 02:06:55,569
You won't have
to suffer anymore.

1072
02:06:55,741 --> 02:06:58,733
You'll live in a big manor.

1073
02:07:00,546 --> 02:07:04,004
A messenger came
from the Matsudaira palace.

1074
02:07:04,383 --> 02:07:07,147
He said Lord Matsudaira
passed away.

1075
02:07:07,486 --> 02:07:11,149
The young lord
has succeeded him.

1076
02:07:12,825 --> 02:07:14,292
My son?

1077
02:07:15,794 --> 02:07:18,354
He's Lord Matsudaira now.

1078
02:07:18,564 --> 02:07:21,089
The messenger said

1079
02:07:21,300 --> 02:07:25,464
the young lord wants his mother
to live with him in the palace.

1080
02:07:25,638 --> 02:07:28,630
You mean
I'll get to see my son?

1081
02:07:29,808 --> 02:07:32,606
I can live with him?

1082
02:07:43,889 --> 02:07:45,857
Thank goodness.

1083
02:07:49,595 --> 02:07:53,691
He's grown
into a good young man.

1084
02:08:31,270 --> 02:08:35,730
I'd like Shinozaki and Tashiro
to deliver a stern rebuke.

1085
02:08:43,215 --> 02:08:46,116
Have you forgotten
your debt of gratitude

1086
02:08:46,285 --> 02:08:48,981
to our late lord?

1087
02:08:49,755 --> 02:08:51,723
Who do you take us for?

1088
02:08:51,924 --> 02:08:56,020
The family line runs
from Tsunemoto Genji,

1089
02:08:56,195 --> 02:08:59,130
grandson of Emperor Seiwa,
through the Nitta clan.

1090
02:08:59,331 --> 02:09:02,323
The lords of our clan
are direct descendants

1091
02:09:02,534 --> 02:09:07,062
of the great
leyasu Tokugawa.

1092
02:09:07,439 --> 02:09:09,737
The late lord
was fourth in line.

1093
02:09:09,908 --> 02:09:12,741
His son Yoshitaka is fifth.

1094
02:09:13,011 --> 02:09:16,412
You were
the late lord's concubine,

1095
02:09:16,582 --> 02:09:18,982
but you reduced yourself
to a courtesan

1096
02:09:19,151 --> 02:09:21,278
and finally a prostitute.

1097
02:09:21,453 --> 02:09:24,889
Do you have any excuse?
Are you not ashamed?

1098
02:09:25,057 --> 02:09:28,390
If word of your vulgar behavior
were to get out,

1099
02:09:28,560 --> 02:09:32,291
it would besmirch
the clan's name,

1100
02:09:32,464 --> 02:09:36,901
and the shogunate's punishment
would be severe.

1101
02:09:37,069 --> 02:09:40,334
We cannot allow you
to come and go as you please.

1102
02:09:40,506 --> 02:09:43,964
You are sentenced
to lifetime confinement.

1103
02:09:45,377 --> 02:09:49,905
You must spend day and night
repenting for your sins

1104
02:09:50,115 --> 02:09:53,551
and beseeching the spirit
of our late lord for forgiveness.

1105
02:09:53,786 --> 02:09:55,549
Now...

1106
02:09:55,721 --> 02:09:58,918
in an exceptional
display of mercy,

1107
02:09:59,091 --> 02:10:02,527
His Lordship will grant you
a brief viewing...

1108
02:10:03,929 --> 02:10:06,193
so that you may
bid him farewell.

1109
02:11:32,351 --> 02:11:34,546
Keep your distance!
This is a serious affront!

1110
02:11:37,022 --> 02:11:41,152
Please allow me
to approach him.

1111
02:11:52,905 --> 02:11:56,534
He's my child.
I gave birth to him.

1112
02:12:01,346 --> 02:12:02,973
Remember our orders!

1113
02:12:04,049 --> 02:12:06,017
I'm going after her!

1114
02:12:42,955 --> 02:12:44,650
<i>You there!</i>

1115
02:12:49,127 --> 02:12:50,890
Isn't she ready yet?

1116
02:12:51,196 --> 02:12:54,222
- Any minute, sir.
- What's taking so long?

1117
02:13:01,673 --> 02:13:03,300
What is it?

1118
02:13:04,076 --> 02:13:05,703
We've lost her.

1119
02:13:06,011 --> 02:13:08,775
How can that be?
Spread out and find her.

1120
02:13:09,348 --> 02:13:10,975
Inform the others!

1121
02:13:11,783 --> 02:13:15,150
Spread out
and look for her!

1122
02:13:20,125 --> 02:13:22,423
The woman has disappeared!

1123
02:13:22,594 --> 02:13:24,289
Disappeared?

1124
02:13:24,463 --> 02:13:26,488
Find her at once!

1125
02:15:26,685 --> 02:15:31,588
<i>Sentient beings</i>
<i>are innumerable</i>

1126
02:15:31,756 --> 02:15:35,749
<i>I vow to save them</i>

1127
02:15:37,529 --> 02:15:42,193
<i>Delusions are inexhaustible</i>

1128
02:15:42,534 --> 02:15:47,437
<i>I vow to extinguish them</i>

1129
02:15:47,939 --> 02:15:52,342
<i>The teachings of the dharma</i>
<i>are immeasurable</i>

1130
02:15:53,011 --> 02:15:58,347
<i>I vow to master them</i>

1131
02:15:59,317 --> 02:16:04,380
<i>Buddhahood is incomparable</i>

1132
02:16:05,023 --> 02:16:09,221
<i>I vow to attain it</i>

1133
02:16:11,229 --> 02:16:16,496
<i>Buddhahood is incomparable</i>

1134
02:16:21,006 --> 02:16:27,172
<i>I vow to attain it</i>

1135
02:16:34,886 --> 02:16:38,913
THE END
