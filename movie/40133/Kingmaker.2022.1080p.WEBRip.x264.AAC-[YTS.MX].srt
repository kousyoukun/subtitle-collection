00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:46,791
<i>Do you know what makes
the people angry the most?</i>

4
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:49,957
<i>That's when you're betrayed
by someone you trusted.</i>

5
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:53,916
THIS FILM WAS INSPIRED BY REAL EVENTS
AND PEOPLE, BUT IT IS A WORK OF FICTION

6
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:00,458
<i>We got 5 chickens at home.</i>

7
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:03,416
<i>2 roosters, and 3 hens.</i>

8
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:06,583
<i>But they haven't laid any eggs in days.</i>

9
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:12,125
My one joy in life is to fry
up an egg for breakfast.

10
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:14,750
You listening?

11
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,083
Keep talking.

12
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:21,125
So for the past 3 days I
kept watch by the coop.

13
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:26,041
At 4AM, I caught a guy
red-handed, sneaking in.

14
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:31,166
Know who it was? My
neighbor, Chang-shik.

15
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:36,875
But that scoundrel,
he denied everything.

16
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:39,207
Can you believe it?

17
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:43,000
He said he came at 4AM to
give my chickens some food.

18
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:47,040
Then you should go to
the village foreman, not me.

19
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:48,708
No way.

20
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:52,041
Chang-shik is the
foreman's cousin's son.

21
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:57,166
People just blamed me for
accusing an innocent man.

22
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:03,500
Now my hens cry each night
like they lost their children.

23
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,125
I can't sleep.

24
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,125
What's this?

25
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:19,916
Tie bits of string to
your chickens' legs.

26
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:24,375
Then late at night, put one of
your hens in Chang-shik's coop.

27
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:28,333
In the morning call all the
villagers over to his place.

28
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,666
"Now it's not just eggs,
he stole my hen!"

29
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:38,250
When he denies it, say you tied
a red string on all your hen's legs.

30
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:42,708
Not even the foreman's
grandfather could save him then.

31
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:46,416
But can I really do that?

32
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,750
He only took a few eggs.

33
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,333
It's a cruel tactic.

34
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:56,500
Or, you can just live
your life as a pushover.

35
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:05,333
But Mr. Pharmacist,
what are you writing there?

36
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,625
I told you not to call me that.

37
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:13,416
The pharmacy is just a temporary job.

38
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:32,790
<i>Gentlemen!</i>

39
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:37,333
<i>In order to secure proper
rights and status for yourselves,</i>

40
00:03:37,334 --> 00:03:41,750
<i>The democratization of this country...</i>

41
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,665
<i>there are times to
negotiate, and times...</i>

42
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:40,707
Shut up!

43
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,625
<i>KIM Woon-bum, you commie!</i>

44
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,291
<i>...and times when you must fight.</i>

45
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:49,291
If industrialists negotiate
in good conscience,

46
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,562
<i>1961, Inje County, Gangwon Province</i>

47
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,915
- Eat this, you commie!
- and promote transparency...

48
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,624
Sir, how could you?

49
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,583
- Don't listen to him!
- Take this man away.

50
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,624
It's all lies!

51
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,540
Let him be. Just let him be.

52
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,666
He said leave me alone!

53
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:09,708
All of us, in any situation,
have the right to speak.

54
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:14,416
I respect this man's words.

55
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,708
And what he says is correct!

56
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:19,541
You mustn't elect a communist!

57
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:24,583
But sir, why do you
think I'm a communist?

58
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:29,541
You're running to hand over
our country to the North!

59
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,625
Sir, as for me.

60
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:38,333
During the war, the Northern
army threw me in Mokpo Prison,

61
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,790
and I just barely escaped
the firing squad.

62
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:46,458
A communist who was nearly
executed by the North Koreans?

63
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:51,500
If I'm a communist,
I'm a pretty stupid one.

64
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,375
<i>To KIM Woon-bum</i>

65
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:22,332
<i>I've come to see Mr. KIM Woon-bum.</i>

66
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,040
<i>He's gone out.</i>

67
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,041
<i>I see.</i>

68
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,583
- When will he...?
- I don't know.

69
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,582
Can I wait until...

70
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,083
- Yes.
- All right.

71
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,250
Hello.

72
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,250
Hi.

73
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,375
Welcome back.

74
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:11,833
Hello.

75
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:13,500
What's our plan for tomorrow?

76
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,625
At 7AM you'll stop by
the community center.

77
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,665
Greet the village elders.

78
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:21,415
At 9AM there's a presentation
on self-governing councils.

79
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,249
At 3PM there's a rice
wine gathering at the...

80
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,583
If you keep using such outdated tactics

81
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,458
you'll lose the next election too!

82
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,500
You've lost 4 times in
7 years, don't you get it?

83
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,083
What the hell?

84
00:06:34,084 --> 00:06:36,374
Sorry, he came looking for Mr. KIM...

85
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:40,666
Your campaign policies
and promises are all fine,

86
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:44,291
but to people who struggle
to put food on the table,

87
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,665
it all sounds like bullshit.

88
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,750
Who does he think he is?

89
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,125
Who are you?

90
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:55,333
Pleased to meet you. I'm SEO Chang-dae.

91
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:56,958
All right.

92
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,750
Chang-dae. What am I doing wrong?

93
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:04,250
Look at the Freedom
Party, how efficient they are!

94
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:07,166
You expound on 10 different issues,

95
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:10,875
and they reply "com-mu-nist",
just three syllables!

96
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,041
What?

97
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,583
Are you the man who sent me a letter?

98
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,750
Yes.

99
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:22,750
For the cost of one vote, I'll
make the other side lose 10.

100
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,832
I thought you could use
such capitalist thinking.

101
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:29,165
Look here, we're
politicians, not merchants!

102
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:32,375
Earning votes or earning
money, what's the difference?

103
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,125
It's different.

104
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:40,250
The goal of a merchant
can be to earn money,

105
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:45,040
but the goal of a politician
shouldn't be to earn votes.

106
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:49,958
Last time, the election board didn't
even let you register as a candidate.

107
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,957
To fight people covered in
shit, you need to get dirty.

108
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:57,208
A nation where politicians
fling shit is nothing but a toilet.

109
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,500
In ancient times, Aristotle
from Greece said this.

110
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:07,208
Justice forms the order of society.

111
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:11,166
Plato said for a just cause,
any means can be considered.

112
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:14,583
And Plato was Aristotle's teacher.

113
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,500
Plato? Damn.

114
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,625
How could he say that?

115
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,583
So what's your proposal?

116
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:34,166
I want to work with you.

117
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,375
Oh damn.

118
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,707
As you see, I can't
afford another salary.

119
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,458
I don't need a salary!

120
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,625
I'm a labor activist after all.

121
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,833
Take care.

122
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:55,249
I'm from the North,
but I lost my accent.

123
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,457
Other people try for years and fail,

124
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,665
but seeing my father killed for
sounding like a commie made it easy!

125
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,165
- Sure, you've had it hard.
- Wait!

126
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,207
Let's go have a smoke.

127
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,915
I want to change this damned world!

128
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,249
Stop it!

129
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,875
In your letter, what was that flower?

130
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,458
People call it "baby's poop."

131
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,416
It's both poison, and antidote.

132
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,666
Please use me.

133
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,625
- You some kind of pharmacist?
- No.

134
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,000
Well, yes.

135
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:38,250
But the pharmacy is
just temporary. I am...

136
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:42,708
KINGMAKER

137
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,666
<i>May 13, 1961: First

<i>November 26, 1963

<i>1967, Mokpo City, Jeolla Province</i>

144

145

to intimidate and assault
supporters of the opposition,

146
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,416
ranging about like roughnecks!

147
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:30,250
The Mokpo police, civil
servants and even the mayor

148
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,166
are campaigning for my defeat.

149
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:36,958
The Republicans' puppet KIM Byung

150
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:41,707
has made me the target of
an operation to wipe me out.

151
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:42,875
Why?

152
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,583
Because he's scared of me!

153
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:56,916
Today, I'm issuing a public
question to President PARK.

154
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:06,208
Do you really plan to amend the
constitution and run for a 3rd term?

155
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,875
What a politician!

156
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,083
Vaulting over KIM Byung
to aim at the president.

157
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,624
Even bringing up the constitution.

158
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:16,665
It's visionary.

159
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:21,041
If he's so visionary,
why treat you that way?

160
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:25,708
Even kings give prized retainers
some kind of employment.

161
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,083
This is like exile.

162
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,875
Exile?

163
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,583
He's given me time
off to recover my health.

164
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,000
Who got him that
representative's badge?

165
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,082
He should at least make you an aide.

166
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,833
It's not the right time!

167
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:47,291
If I take an official position, it'll
give those scoundrels a target.

168
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,583
Which scoundrels?

169
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:06,333
So will KIM Young-ho and KIM
Woon-bum join the National Assembly?

170
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,500
What did Mr. President say?

171
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:13,332
We can give the opposition 10
or 20 seats, but not those two!

172
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,000
Realistically, it'll be hard
to stop KIM Young-ho.

173
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,750
Don't say it'll be hard
in front of Mr. President!

174
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,250
How hard for him to
listen to such drivel!

175
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:27,333
KIM Young-ho is the New
Democrats' floor leader,

176
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,625
and swinging an election
in Busan is too expensive.

177
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,332
What about KIM Woon-bum?

178
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,958
We're focusing our ammunition on him.

179
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,374
Don't make it too obvious.

180
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,750
Obvious is okay!

181
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,666
But Mr. President.

182
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,791
KIM Young-ho is one thing,

183
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,707
but do we really have to
worry about KIM Woon-bum?

184
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,333
Hey, Colonel Chun!

185
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,291
Don't interrupt the adults in the room.

186
00:12:56,083 --> 00:13:00,500
And you, why discourage the lad?

187
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,958
Tell us your thoughts.

188
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:10,333
If we spend so much to beat
a second-tier local newbie,

189
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:14,125
it makes us look weak
in the eyes of the public.

190
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,958
That's why they treat you like a kid!

191
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:25,291
Who here sees KIM Woon-bum
as a second-tier local newbie?

192
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,291
That's right.

193
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:33,708
More than anything,
that guy talks too much.

194
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:34,958
<i>Today...</i>

195
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:39,832
Remember that last Assembly,
when he did his filibuster thing?

196
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:44,041
You know how long he went on
mocking us, without even a script?

197
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,208
5 hours and 19 minutes!

198
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:55,708
If he stays in the National Assembly,
he'll be a huge headache for us.

199
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,166
He's a threat to me?

200
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,416
No Mr. President,
that's not what I meant.

201
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:02,958
Of course he is.

202
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,083
You see what's going on.

203
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:11,791
Here!

204
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:21,708
The revolution I started
is not yet complete.

205
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:28,500
Are we going to let some
idealist fools stand in my way?

206
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:29,916
No, Mr. President!

207
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:39,208
Gentlemen, come with me to Mokpo.

208
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:46,541
<i>President Park, ahead of the
National Assembly elections,</i>

209
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:50,791
<i>received an enthusiastic welcome
from the citizens of Mokpo.</i>

210
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,375
<i>I will take personal responsibility
for developing Mokpo's economy.</i>

211
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:54,208
<i>President's Address To Mokpo Citizens</i>

212
00:14:55,916 --> 00:15:01,625
I'll rebuild the rusting port,
and found a new university.

213
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,540
Dear citizens of Mokpo,

214
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:10,375
trust in me, and cast your
vote for nominee KIM Byung.

215
00:15:13,325 --> 00:15:18,116
<i>Nominee KIM Byung,
who had been in 2nd place,</i>

216
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:22,240
<i>has received a boost from the
President's unprecedented visit,</i>

217
00:15:22,241 --> 00:15:26,783
<i>upsetting the race with
his gains in popularity.</i>

218
00:15:33,991 --> 00:15:37,950
<i>Today the President held
a cabinet meeting in Mokpo.</i>

219
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,074
<i>- It's a first for a regional city...</i>
- I'll be damned.

220
00:15:41,075 --> 00:15:43,116
What the hell is that?

221
00:15:43,783 --> 00:15:46,575
They moved the whole
government down to Mokpo.

222
00:15:46,991 --> 00:15:49,783
<i>At the cabinet meeting...</i>

223
00:15:52,658 --> 00:15:56,240
Once he returns to Seoul,
all this will die down.

224
00:15:56,241 --> 00:15:59,825
Every crisis is an opportunity,
and the attention may help us.

225
00:16:00,408 --> 00:16:04,032
After this cabinet meeting, the
whole nation's eyes are on Mokpo.

226
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:08,032
Right, since we have the youth vote...

227
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:12,241
Don't strain yourselves
trying to lift the mood.

228
00:16:13,491 --> 00:16:15,283
Your writing is really good.

229
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,491
But it can be shorter.

230
00:16:20,366 --> 00:16:23,740
A speech is more powerful
if it's short and concise.

231
00:16:23,741 --> 00:16:24,783
I see.

232
00:16:25,783 --> 00:16:29,075
Who do we have here?

233
00:16:35,866 --> 00:16:36,908
You're back.

234
00:16:40,158 --> 00:16:41,408
How have you been?

235
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,824
It's him, right?

236
00:16:44,825 --> 00:16:47,365
The one who got Mr. KIM elected twice?

237
00:16:47,366 --> 00:16:49,700
Busan Girl. Work on the speech.

238
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,033
Who could think that damned
pharmacist elected anyone?

239
00:16:54,533 --> 00:16:57,325
Don't start again. Go on!

240
00:16:57,533 --> 00:16:59,575
Give the kid a break.

241
00:17:01,991 --> 00:17:04,825
They say he got time
off for his health,

242
00:17:05,408 --> 00:17:07,450
but really it was more like probation.

243
00:17:07,908 --> 00:17:09,325
Why? Did something happen?

244
00:17:09,658 --> 00:17:11,533
A lot happened.

245
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,075
He'd sell his own parents'
gravestones in order to win.

246
00:17:18,991 --> 00:17:21,200
Did you hear that rumor?

247
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:26,241
Last election, about Republican
CHOI Mun-sik's secret child.

248
00:17:26,408 --> 00:17:27,658
Yes, I remember.

249
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:30,575
That dirty rumor was SEO's doing.

250
00:17:31,366 --> 00:17:34,137
But CHOI held a press
conference and denied everything.

251
00:17:34,138 --> 00:17:36,366
<i>It's a dirty rumor! That's not my son!</i>

252
00:17:34,491 --> 00:17:35,658
Sure.

253
00:17:36,366 --> 00:17:38,575
That's exactly what SEO wanted.

254
00:17:39,116 --> 00:17:44,783
He needed the image of CHOI
denying the rumor in front of everyone.

255
00:17:46,075 --> 00:17:49,700
He said it doesn't
matter if it's true or not.

256
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:58,615
I still don't agree with your methods.

257
00:17:58,616 --> 00:18:01,283
I knew you'd call on me again sometime.

258
00:18:03,491 --> 00:18:04,700
But still...

259
00:18:06,408 --> 00:18:11,075
I'm not a jar of fruit that
you can taste at your leisure.

260
00:18:18,283 --> 00:18:22,533
You remember what you
said when we first met?

261
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,491
You want to change the world.

262
00:18:27,116 --> 00:18:30,741
A world where innocent people
aren't persecuted as communists,

263
00:18:31,658 --> 00:18:34,282
where you can speak without fear,

264
00:18:34,283 --> 00:18:37,700
where the nation doesn't
force sacrifice on its people.

265
00:18:39,075 --> 00:18:42,283
Creating such a world
is my biggest goal.

266
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:43,991
You need to win

267
00:18:45,366 --> 00:18:47,575
in order to realize that goal.

268
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,158
I really want to experience
that world you speak of.

269
00:18:57,033 --> 00:19:01,700
But I can no longer be your fruit jar.

270
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,616
I want to be more.

271
00:19:12,075 --> 00:19:14,033
That'll be hard right now.

272
00:19:14,991 --> 00:19:19,366
But when you're ready,
it will surely happen.

273
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,450
So, are you with me?

274
00:19:31,533 --> 00:19:36,450
<i>But many of them out there
object strongly to your methods.</i>

275
00:19:38,116 --> 00:19:39,866
For our remaining time,

276
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,824
I, SEO Chang-dae will
help with the campaign.

277
00:19:44,825 --> 00:19:48,282
Don't deny your flaws,
tackle them head on.

278
00:19:48,283 --> 00:19:50,533
Some of you already know me,

279
00:19:51,408 --> 00:19:55,075
and some may want to curse
when hearing what I've done.

280
00:19:56,991 --> 00:20:00,575
But we're not here for a
friendly game of cards, are we?

281
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:04,241
Life is hard enough as it is,

282
00:20:05,575 --> 00:20:07,116
so why are we all here?

283
00:20:08,491 --> 00:20:10,908
You there. What's your answer?

284
00:20:11,158 --> 00:20:15,990
Well, we're here to help
Mr. KIM get elected.

285
00:20:15,991 --> 00:20:17,158
No.

286
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:18,783
No, no, no.

287
00:20:18,866 --> 00:20:23,325
For any organization to work,
each member needs agency.

288
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,657
We're not here for KIM Woon-bum.

289
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:28,199
Everyone needs to feel some ownership.

290
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,200
Let's not underestimate ourselves here.

291
00:20:32,241 --> 00:20:36,366
Like KIM Woon-bum, we
want to fight the Republicans!

292
00:20:37,033 --> 00:20:39,116
We're not here for KIM Woon-bum,

293
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,325
but to use KIM Woon-bum as a weapon

294
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:47,532
in a brawl with those
rotten scoundrels, right?

295
00:20:47,533 --> 00:20:50,866
I agree! He's right, isn't he?

296
00:20:51,741 --> 00:20:55,616
But the problem is,
this isn't a clean fight.

297
00:20:57,033 --> 00:21:00,950
You all know the Republicans
are passing out cash and gifts?

298
00:21:01,491 --> 00:21:07,115
Their liquor is raining over Mokpo,
and their feasts create mountains.

299
00:21:07,116 --> 00:21:08,366
And is that all?

300
00:21:09,283 --> 00:21:14,282
During the last election, there was
a blackout during the vote count.

301
00:21:14,283 --> 00:21:16,532
What? Is there a blackout?

302
00:21:16,533 --> 00:21:18,282
You know what that means?

303
00:21:18,283 --> 00:21:22,240
The government's inspectors
switched all the ballots!

304
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:23,533
Dirty scoundrels!

305
00:21:25,658 --> 00:21:28,033
Listen up!

306
00:21:30,533 --> 00:21:32,658
There's a robber with a knife.

307
00:21:33,283 --> 00:21:35,408
Should we fight him
with our bare hands?

308
00:21:35,908 --> 00:21:39,700
We have a right to self-defense.
We need something!

309
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:44,575
I'm at least going to
give you a rolling pin.

310
00:21:45,491 --> 00:21:48,241
If you think that's too vile and cheap,

311
00:21:49,491 --> 00:21:51,116
let's just give up.

312
00:21:51,325 --> 00:21:55,158
Let's drink the Republicans'
booze and go to sleep.

313
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:06,491
You know what words I hate the most?

314
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:13,283
"We lost but we put up a good fight."

315
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:18,116
Whatever it takes, I'm
going to make KIM win.

316
00:22:19,075 --> 00:22:22,491
And when he wins, then I...!

317
00:22:24,283 --> 00:22:25,866
Then all of us win!

318
00:22:27,408 --> 00:22:28,700
What do you think?

319
00:22:29,533 --> 00:22:30,741
I'm going to fight!

320
00:22:30,866 --> 00:22:35,949
- Let's beat those scumbags!
- Let's do it together!

321
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:41,533
KIM Woon-bum! KIM Woon-bum!

322
00:22:42,033 --> 00:22:47,908
KIM Woon-bum! KIM Woon-bum!

323
00:22:50,616 --> 00:22:51,908
He's good.

324
00:22:53,241 --> 00:22:55,116
Talented at that, too...

325
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,491
Hey, SEO!

326
00:23:13,866 --> 00:23:15,408
What is all this?

327
00:23:16,116 --> 00:23:17,824
I ordered 100 in total.

328
00:23:17,825 --> 00:23:20,657
Pick out some of the smarter
volunteers and pass them out.

329
00:23:20,658 --> 00:23:25,782
But they're volunteering for the
Republicans, not the New Democrats.

330
00:23:25,783 --> 00:23:27,865
<i>Republican Party</i>

331
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:31,908
<i>Send out people in pairs
to visit tenant farmers.</i>

332
00:23:32,116 --> 00:23:38,325
Many of them just vote for whoever
their village head tells them to,

333
00:23:38,866 --> 00:23:40,450
so we'll target that.

334
00:23:40,991 --> 00:23:42,365
Who's the village head?

335
00:23:42,366 --> 00:23:45,366
It's the Republicans,
fishing for votes.

336
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:47,700
God, the smell out here...

337
00:23:49,158 --> 00:23:51,158
Vote for KIM Byung, okay?

338
00:23:51,241 --> 00:23:55,407
We don't care about voting, so
go back where you came from.

339
00:23:55,408 --> 00:23:57,199
Then at least don't
vote for KIM Woon-bum!

340
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,700
Is there a bug up your ass?

341
00:23:59,991 --> 00:24:01,950
Why are you so rude?

342
00:24:02,033 --> 00:24:04,283
This goddamned cow shit!

343
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:13,700
What happened to your faces?

344
00:24:13,991 --> 00:24:16,408
That's none of your business.

345
00:24:17,283 --> 00:24:20,158
Are you for KIM Byung or KIM Woon-bum?

346
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:25,075
Well, KIM Woon-bum
has done a good job for us.

347
00:24:25,408 --> 00:24:26,408
I'm for KIM Woon-bum.

348
00:24:26,409 --> 00:24:31,741
Didn't you hear the President? If
KIM Byung wins, we get a new port.

349
00:24:31,866 --> 00:24:35,991
Sure enough, the dad's
wiser than the son!

350
00:24:36,783 --> 00:24:38,532
Here, have a smoke.

351
00:24:38,533 --> 00:24:41,408
Wait! What brand do you smoke?

352
00:24:41,616 --> 00:24:42,658
Arirang.

353
00:24:42,741 --> 00:24:44,616
What a patriot!

354
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,200
Hand out Arirang to them.

355
00:24:48,533 --> 00:24:50,450
This is the brand U.S. soldiers smoke.

356
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,450
You smoke this one.

357
00:24:54,283 --> 00:24:55,700
Let's see here.

358
00:25:04,866 --> 00:25:08,325
Remember, KIM Byung!

359
00:25:08,825 --> 00:25:12,824
People like KIM Woon-bum
who speak well are all commies.

360
00:25:12,825 --> 00:25:16,491
He never graduated university.
What a world we live in.

361
00:25:16,866 --> 00:25:20,741
These uneducated peasants
pretending to be high class.

362
00:25:21,075 --> 00:25:24,991
Hey, watch your mouth.

363
00:25:25,533 --> 00:25:27,032
You Republicans...

364
00:25:27,033 --> 00:25:29,033
Cut!

365
00:25:29,825 --> 00:25:33,158
Who will look at you if
you speak so quietly?

366
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,783
Anyone got a bit more spirit?

367
00:25:39,575 --> 00:25:43,074
Hey you scumbag asshole shitheads!

368
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:44,825
Cut!

369
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,700
Without swearing.

370
00:25:49,741 --> 00:25:53,450
Look here, you! What
kind of crap is that?

371
00:25:53,741 --> 00:25:56,574
You think I don't know what
you Republicans are scheming?

372
00:25:56,575 --> 00:26:01,533
You wanna take down KIM Woon-bum
before he becomes president?

373
00:26:01,658 --> 00:26:03,824
Hey everyone, you know what?

374
00:26:03,825 --> 00:26:08,741
If KIM Woon-bum wins, Mokpo
might even get its own President...

375
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:18,282
What are you people doing? Comrade!

376
00:26:18,283 --> 00:26:19,450
Hey, run!

377
00:26:20,033 --> 00:26:24,450
Comrade! Are you okay?

378
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,241
I think I'm bleeding.

379
00:26:27,658 --> 00:26:29,450
I'm bleeding!

380
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,950
Look, it's blood!

381
00:26:33,241 --> 00:26:35,491
Blood! Red blood!

382
00:26:35,658 --> 00:26:39,741
Those Republican thugs
drew blood and ran off!

383
00:26:40,408 --> 00:26:44,450
<i>Damn Republican thugs!
Dirty scoundrels!</i>

384
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,407
<i>Republican Party Feast, 8PM</i>

385
00:26:53,408 --> 00:26:56,532
Instead of doing her work, she's
posting these around town.

386
00:26:56,533 --> 00:27:01,283
It's a feast for village elders,
held in the Republicans' name.

387
00:27:01,658 --> 00:27:03,199
Don't worry about that.

388
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,158
Since there won't be any feast,

389
00:27:05,741 --> 00:27:07,574
it won't cost us any money.

390
00:27:07,575 --> 00:27:10,283
But the village elders will
be furious at Republicans.

391
00:27:10,575 --> 00:27:12,616
Wow, how crude.

392
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,283
Did you learn this in North Korea?

393
00:27:15,491 --> 00:27:18,783
I guess in the South, things
that work are called crude.

394
00:27:19,116 --> 00:27:21,325
Are these all the rubber shoes we have?

395
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:22,825
Oh gosh.

396
00:27:23,866 --> 00:27:27,408
We barely covered these
with campaign donations.

397
00:27:27,533 --> 00:27:30,658
The Republicans are giving
out dress shirts with the shoes.

398
00:27:30,866 --> 00:27:33,283
And sugar with the flour.

399
00:27:33,616 --> 00:27:37,658
All this pretending to be
Republicans is making us poor.

400
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,283
Our pharmacist is great
at cooking up schemes.

401
00:27:43,741 --> 00:27:45,908
But I guess you don't check the ledger.

402
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:58,700
Hey, eat your dinner!

403
00:27:59,325 --> 00:28:00,575
No!

404
00:28:02,241 --> 00:28:03,366
What is it now?

405
00:28:03,741 --> 00:28:08,075
I give him 10 won for each
multiplication table he learns.

406
00:28:08,658 --> 00:28:11,616
Today he did the 9
tables, so he's done.

407
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:15,033
Then did you give him 90 won?

408
00:28:15,408 --> 00:28:16,408
No.

409
00:28:17,158 --> 00:28:19,991
I took back all the
coins I'd given him.

410
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:24,866
He learned his tables and
I have my money, win-win.

411
00:28:25,075 --> 00:28:27,283
What a cruel woman you are.

412
00:28:32,033 --> 00:28:34,325
Oh my, it's the Republicans!

413
00:28:34,533 --> 00:28:35,990
What brings you here?

414
00:28:35,991 --> 00:28:38,908
You received something
from us yesterday, right?

415
00:28:39,158 --> 00:28:42,866
Yes, we got a dress
shirt and rubber shoes.

416
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:45,366
We're going to have to take those back.

417
00:28:45,616 --> 00:28:47,741
There was a mistake. Those
shouldn't have gone out.

418
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:54,700
Take them back!

419
00:28:55,408 --> 00:29:00,158
<i>We'll take back the Republicans'
gifts in their own name.</i>

420
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:01,908
Good day.

421
00:29:06,491 --> 00:29:08,908
<i>Dress shirts, rubber
shoes, sugar and flour...</i>

422
00:29:09,533 --> 00:29:14,283
<i>They'll be madder than if
they never received anything.</i>

423
00:29:14,616 --> 00:29:17,866
Flour goes over there. Two bags...

424
00:29:18,533 --> 00:29:21,991
You scoundrel! How
can you take it back?

425
00:29:22,783 --> 00:29:26,157
Bastards, why'd you hand
them out in the first place!

426
00:29:26,158 --> 00:29:28,450
Did I ask for those? Did I?

427
00:29:28,825 --> 00:29:31,700
Republican bastards, don't
dare campaign in Mokpo!

428
00:29:32,158 --> 00:29:35,575
Nice work... nice work.

429
00:29:38,658 --> 00:29:39,658
<i>Republican Party</i>

430
00:29:39,991 --> 00:29:41,491
Yeah, nice work...

431
00:29:42,241 --> 00:29:43,241
<i>New Democratic Party</i>

432
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,575
<i>New Democratic Party</i>

433
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:55,616
This is from the New Democrats.

434
00:29:56,741 --> 00:30:00,075
You know how much
cash we put into Mokpo?

435
00:30:00,741 --> 00:30:02,741
Then why aren't the polls going up?

436
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:07,158
Mr. President made a personal visit!

437
00:30:07,908 --> 00:30:11,908
You were a government minister,
how will it look if you lose?

438
00:30:12,658 --> 00:30:14,157
I don't know what to say.

439
00:30:14,158 --> 00:30:19,115
From what I hear, KIM Woon-bum
is handing out gifts, too.

440
00:30:19,116 --> 00:30:22,533
Any idea who's funding them?

441
00:30:22,783 --> 00:30:24,950
That can't be.

442
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:27,158
They're stone broke.

443
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:29,115
How can they be buying gifts?

444
00:30:29,116 --> 00:30:33,033
So my people are
giving me false reports?

445
00:30:38,408 --> 00:30:39,658
My apologies.

446
00:30:40,575 --> 00:30:42,866
The upcoming speech
is your last chance.

447
00:30:43,283 --> 00:30:46,825
Get proof that KIM Woon-bum
handed out gifts,

448
00:30:47,158 --> 00:30:49,866
and use that as ammunition, okay?

449
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:54,241
That he's no different
from the rest of us.

450
00:30:54,533 --> 00:30:57,283
<i>Minna dorobodesu. (They're all crooks)</i>

451
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:06,700
For the sake of Mokpo's revival,
don't keep voting for the opposition!

452
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:09,491
Realistically, KIM Woon-bum

453
00:31:09,783 --> 00:31:13,200
lacks the money and
power to develop Mokpo.

454
00:31:13,491 --> 00:31:18,450
I admit that KIM Woon-bum
is a good representative.

455
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,741
Young, with the integrity
to confront injustice.

456
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:25,033
At least that's what I thought.

457
00:31:26,908 --> 00:31:28,616
But ladies and gentlemen,

458
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,783
do you see this?

459
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:41,241
The New Democrats are using
these dirty bribes to buy votes!

460
00:31:41,741 --> 00:31:46,533
Even as they criticize us
and pretend to be pure,

461
00:31:46,908 --> 00:31:50,741
they go around passing out gifts!

462
00:31:53,908 --> 00:31:58,241
KIM Woon-bum, if you
have any self-respect,

463
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:03,158
admit your hypocrisy and
apologize to Mokpo's citizens!

464
00:32:07,283 --> 00:32:09,865
Effective my ass! That
damned Northerner.

465
00:32:09,866 --> 00:32:12,450
Please vote for me, KIM Byung.

466
00:32:13,783 --> 00:32:14,950
Thank you.

467
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:22,366
KIM Byung! KIM Byung!

468
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,783
When KIM Byung took these shoes

469
00:32:48,991 --> 00:32:51,950
and dress shirt and waved them around,

470
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:57,366
I thought it was some
kind of sales pitch.

471
00:33:01,866 --> 00:33:04,949
KIM, who has the
backing of the President,

472
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:10,033
accused the New Democrats
and I of lacking money and power.

473
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,241
Then he says we're passing out gifts.

474
00:33:14,783 --> 00:33:18,325
Isn't that a contradiction?

475
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:20,908
- Just apologize!
- However...

476
00:33:23,408 --> 00:33:26,533
If these gifts really belong
to the New Democratic party,

477
00:33:26,908 --> 00:33:29,200
then I will apologize to KIM Byung.

478
00:33:29,991 --> 00:33:35,325
But if for the sake of penniless me,

479
00:33:36,116 --> 00:33:40,533
in the face of our era's
fear and oppression,

480
00:33:41,033 --> 00:33:44,574
there are people spending their
own money to pass these out,

481
00:33:44,575 --> 00:33:49,033
then I don't know how to thank
the good citizens of Mokpo.

482
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:58,866
But Mr. KIM Byung.

483
00:33:59,158 --> 00:34:03,116
You say the Republicans caught
the New Democrats passing out gifts.

484
00:34:04,825 --> 00:34:09,075
Isn't that like the robbers
catching the cops?

485
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:28,366
My dear, respected citizens of Mokpo.

486
00:34:29,408 --> 00:34:34,908
I will dedicate my
life fighting to protect

487
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:38,825
democracy in this nation.

488
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:46,075
If I should die in this fight, before
you put flowers on my body,

489
00:34:46,866 --> 00:34:51,366
please continue battling to
uproot these rigged elections.

490
00:34:52,783 --> 00:34:56,408
Otherwise, even while dead

491
00:35:00,825 --> 00:35:02,991
I won't be able to shut my eyes.

492
00:35:06,575 --> 00:35:09,158
I speak to Yudal Mountain,

493
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:14,616
to the flowing Youngsan
River, and to Samhak Island.

494
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:18,575
Yudal Mountain!

495
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:22,033
If you have a soul...

496
00:35:23,741 --> 00:35:26,283
Samhak Island, if you have spirit...

497
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:33,116
Youngsan River, if you
have consciousness...

498
00:35:34,783 --> 00:35:40,075
This nation's government
has made a target of me,

499
00:35:40,741 --> 00:35:44,200
so I appeal to you, please protect me

500
00:35:44,741 --> 00:35:49,033
from the Park regime's poisoned knife.

501
00:35:56,241 --> 00:36:01,658
KIM Woon-bum! KIM Woon-bum!

502
00:36:06,908 --> 00:36:10,741
<i>Results are in for the National
Assembly, Mokpo district.</i>

503
00:36:11,325 --> 00:36:14,241
<i>With 52,017 ballots cast,</i>

504
00:36:14,825 --> 00:36:20,075
<i>Republican KIM Byung
received 22,738 votes,</i>

505
00:36:20,658 --> 00:36:25,366

506
00:36:26,283 --> 00:36:31,783
<i>The winner of the 1967 election,

507
00:36:52,158 --> 00:36:53,158
Hey.

508
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,616
Hey!

509
00:36:56,075 --> 00:36:57,408
Don't touch that.

510
00:37:00,241 --> 00:37:05,283
You know how hard it was
for our boys to find you?

511
00:37:06,741 --> 00:37:10,033
You've got no title. What are you?

512
00:37:10,533 --> 00:37:12,825
We invented a nickname for you.

513
00:37:14,116 --> 00:37:15,158
The Shadow.

514
00:37:16,616 --> 00:37:18,241
My hard work was worth it.

515
00:37:18,616 --> 00:37:20,408
Such a great nickname.

516
00:37:21,325 --> 00:37:22,740
A sad nickname.

517
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:25,700
You did so much, but no one knows it.

518
00:37:29,158 --> 00:37:32,783
I'm a total fan of yours, you know?

519
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:37,533
Your methods are criminally
vile, I'm impressed!

520
00:37:37,825 --> 00:37:41,408
I don't break the law by vote rigging
or abuse of power, like some.

521
00:37:41,866 --> 00:37:45,450
Or is it illegal to be as smart as me?

522
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:52,700
Wow, meeting you in
person, you're shameless.

523
00:37:53,033 --> 00:37:54,366
Fearless, too.

524
00:37:54,741 --> 00:37:56,575
We're not here to scare you.

525
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:10,450
Make yourself a nameplate
and work in a sunny office.

526
00:38:12,866 --> 00:38:18,408
You'll be working for the
most powerful man in Korea.

527
00:38:22,825 --> 00:38:24,658
Give me some time to think.

528
00:38:24,908 --> 00:38:26,866
We can't wait too long.

529
00:38:27,283 --> 00:38:29,575
How long? A week?

530
00:38:30,325 --> 00:38:31,616
3 seconds.

531
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,575
I refuse.

532
00:38:37,366 --> 00:38:39,658
I'm picky about who I work for.

533
00:38:45,408 --> 00:38:48,491
You scum, who do you think you are?

534
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:51,616
You've got a North Korean accent, too?

535
00:38:52,533 --> 00:38:55,490
Let's see if you still chatter
with a hole in your face.

536
00:38:55,491 --> 00:38:56,950
Chief KIM, that's enough.

537
00:39:00,366 --> 00:39:02,325
Are you ordering me?

538
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:06,616
How could I? This is a private home.

539
00:39:11,825 --> 00:39:14,283
Wow!

540
00:39:17,033 --> 00:39:18,533
My mistake.

541
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:21,624
Secretary LEE.

542
00:39:22,158 --> 00:39:25,200
My damn mistake! Pardon me all to hell.

543
00:39:36,075 --> 00:39:39,741
Wow, our President is amazing.

544
00:39:40,491 --> 00:39:43,658
Pitting two subordinates
like you against each other.

545
00:39:45,033 --> 00:39:46,616
But be careful.

546
00:39:47,366 --> 00:39:52,116
Being fired by a boss
like that won't be nice.

547
00:39:53,366 --> 00:39:55,116
Is your boss any different?

548
00:39:55,325 --> 00:39:56,741
Much different.

549
00:39:57,158 --> 00:39:59,700
I'm envious. Of your boss.

550
00:40:02,741 --> 00:40:06,741
You can't buy such
loyalty from your followers.

551
00:40:07,325 --> 00:40:10,200
But if KIM Woon-bum keeps
being called a communist,

552
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:13,366
can he properly groom
a person from the North?

553
00:40:15,575 --> 00:40:20,575
And your work isn't something
you can announce to the world.

554
00:40:23,491 --> 00:40:25,366
If you change your mind, call me.

555
00:40:26,158 --> 00:40:27,658
Mr. Shadow.

limits to 12 years was passed.</i>

559
00:41:02,741 --> 00:41:04,615
Just serve for life, you tyrant!

560
00:41:04,616 --> 00:41:06,615
Tyrant? Want to get arrested?

561
00:41:06,616 --> 00:41:08,700

566

567
00:41:23,991 --> 00:41:25,574

00:41:25,575 --> 00:41:29,116

00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:35,158

00:41:55,783 --> 00:41:58,575
<i>Did you hear Chief KIM was fired?</i>

571
00:41:59,033 --> 00:42:02,200
<i>After how high he flew?</i>

572
00:42:03,283 --> 00:42:04,990
He deserves it.

573
00:42:04,991 --> 00:42:07,283
He's been so vicious.

574
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:09,699
He was in charge of the amendment.

575
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,450
Now it's been passed,
he's no longer needed.

576
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:15,908
And they probably needed a
bone to toss to the opposition.

577
00:42:18,491 --> 00:42:20,783
You pick things up fast, Su-yeon.

578
00:42:22,116 --> 00:42:24,116
That fermented fish is no joke.

579
00:42:26,033 --> 00:42:29,116
Is that...?

580
00:42:46,366 --> 00:42:48,075
Leave me some gills.

581
00:42:49,075 --> 00:42:52,116
Representative KIM Young-ho, right?

582
00:42:52,533 --> 00:42:54,449
He's so good looking.

583
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:57,074
Don't act like a schoolgirl.
He's just a politician.

584
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:58,740
What do you mean?

585
00:42:58,741 --> 00:43:01,157
He's like a hero in these parts.

586
00:43:01,158 --> 00:43:04,908
Right, the youngest representative,
the youngest floor leader ever.

587
00:43:06,033 --> 00:43:08,574
And that's Representative LEE Han-sang!

588
00:43:08,575 --> 00:43:10,574
Right. Look at that!

589
00:43:10,575 --> 00:43:13,700
Why are all the big
shots gathering here?

590
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:16,282
They're not part of our group,

591
00:43:16,283 --> 00:43:18,575
and things have been turbulent lately.

592
00:43:19,441 --> 00:43:20,441
Interesting.

593
00:43:21,108 --> 00:43:23,983
Those three men, meeting
without party leader KANG.

594
00:43:25,775 --> 00:43:27,566
<i>KANG In-san...</i>

595
00:43:28,108 --> 00:43:32,733
<i>Based on experience, KANG would
be the #1 presidential candidate.</i>

596
00:43:34,316 --> 00:43:37,483
<i>Of course party leader
KIM Young-ho is #2.</i>

597
00:43:39,191 --> 00:43:42,733
<i>And #3 I guess is LEE Han-sang.</i>

598
00:43:44,108 --> 00:43:48,525
<i>Why are these two men visiting
a minority politician like Mr. KIM?</i>

599
00:43:50,233 --> 00:43:53,400
<i>Let's think about it in reverse.</i>

600
00:43:54,066 --> 00:43:56,066
<i>If I were the Republicans?</i>

601
00:43:57,066 --> 00:44:00,108
<i>I'd probably be most
comfortable with KANG.</i>

602
00:44:02,316 --> 00:44:06,941
Feels pretty odd to be
sitting here on your turf.

603
00:44:07,816 --> 00:44:10,149
Please make yourself comfortable.

604
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:12,150
I didn't say I was uncomfortable.

605
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:17,357
Right, why should a top
dog feel uncomfortable?

606
00:44:17,358 --> 00:44:21,691
Secretary LEE, the opposition
leader is hardly a top dog.

607
00:44:23,441 --> 00:44:26,858
Who knows, you might
be president someday.

608
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:38,650
Don't sound me out,
just tell me what you want.

609
00:44:42,483 --> 00:44:43,483
Sir.

610
00:44:44,941 --> 00:44:49,816
In next year's election, please
run against the President.

611
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:57,441
We haven't picked our candidate yet.

612
00:44:58,441 --> 00:45:02,358
A contest for the nation's top
job should be fought by adults.

613
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,816
Not a bunch of kids.

614
00:45:06,025 --> 00:45:08,358
It's a bad look for the people.

615
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:14,941
By kid, you must mean KIM Young-ho?

616
00:45:15,233 --> 00:45:16,858
KIM Young-ho...

617
00:45:17,941 --> 00:45:19,358
or LEE Han-sang...

618
00:45:19,733 --> 00:45:21,275
Those are my kids.

619
00:45:21,941 --> 00:45:25,233
I didn't bring them up
to betray their elders.

He really is a natural at this.

631
00:46:06,108 --> 00:46:08,316
Did you just lose your chance to run?

632
00:46:09,483 --> 00:46:14,066
Whether that's courage or
recklessness, we have to see.

633
00:46:15,816 --> 00:46:18,024
We don't know how KANG will respond.

Wow, the old man is pretty worked up.

638
00:46:35,525 --> 00:46:39,566
KIM Young-ho miscalculated.
It'll be hard to recover.

639
00:46:40,816 --> 00:46:45,483
If LEE Han-sang and you
join him, it's a different story.

Did you three make
an agreement that day?

00:46:57,108 --> 00:47:02,691
We three people in our
40s, let's shake things up!

643
00:47:03,566 --> 00:47:06,732
I've got a mind to run for president.

644
00:47:06,733 --> 00:47:10,191
If you run, then so will I.

645
00:47:11,191 --> 00:47:15,150
But aren't you two KANG's people?

646
00:47:15,525 --> 00:47:20,066
Don't be ridiculous.
KANG's a Republican lapdog.

647
00:47:20,525 --> 00:47:23,441
Three drums make more noise than two.

648
00:47:23,691 --> 00:47:28,066
For the 40s faction to
succeed, you should run too,

649
00:47:28,233 --> 00:47:30,400
and we'll make a united front.

650
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:34,658
My friend, aren't we
making a democracy?

651
00:47:36,783 --> 00:47:38,866
Democracy my ass!

652
00:47:43,033 --> 00:47:45,491
He's just inviting you to his party.

653
00:47:45,825 --> 00:47:50,158
The "40s Faction" would
make a good headline.

654
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:53,282
You don't seem to
know national politics,

655
00:47:53,283 --> 00:47:56,991
but even if we succeed, it
only helps KIM Young-ho.

656
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:58,241
Right.

657
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:03,283
He's at the party's center.
We can't win that fight.

658
00:48:05,241 --> 00:48:08,116
We'll never win by avoiding a fight.

659
00:48:08,533 --> 00:48:12,700
It's not avoidance, it's
building up for the next fight.

660
00:48:13,033 --> 00:48:16,740
The nomination isn't a popular
vote, it's an internal fight for power.

661
00:48:16,741 --> 00:48:18,575
I know we're at a disadvantage.

662
00:48:19,116 --> 00:48:23,450
But you and I are paid
to find a way to win.

663
00:48:23,783 --> 00:48:27,825
Let's imagine we're for KIM Young-ho.

664
00:48:28,241 --> 00:48:31,366
If KIM Woon-bum runs, what will we say?

665
00:48:31,866 --> 00:48:34,491
Thanks for being a cog in my victory!

666
00:48:35,908 --> 00:48:38,365
I think Secretary PARK's right.

667
00:48:38,366 --> 00:48:40,116
- Of course.
- But...

668
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,574
the future is something
we all make together.

669
00:48:43,575 --> 00:48:47,533
Hey, if we run, KIM
Young-ho gets nominated!

670
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:48,950
But...

671
00:48:49,991 --> 00:48:52,408
would that be so bad?

672
00:48:53,366 --> 00:48:57,074
Like us, KIM Young-ho has
long fought against dictatorship.

673
00:48:57,075 --> 00:49:00,616
I'd be the better choice...

00:50:05,283 --> 00:50:07,657
Then what about the foreman?

688
00:50:07,658 --> 00:50:10,990
What do you think? He's sick in bed.

689
00:50:10,991 --> 00:50:13,116
Those ungrateful kids!

690
00:50:13,241 --> 00:50:14,950
Ungrateful?

691
00:50:15,325 --> 00:50:19,115
Our foreman is the governor's lapdog.

692
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:20,408
Lapdog!

693
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,740
Is it really true?

694
00:50:22,741 --> 00:50:23,907
Isn't it obvious?

695
00:50:23,908 --> 00:50:28,783
<i>If you're not a public administrator
or a cop, who wears a mustache?</i>

696
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,990
<i>That's right. Rather
than a tired old man,</i>

697
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:35,824
<i>we're better off with one of his sons.</i>

698
00:50:35,825 --> 00:50:36,616
<i>We are!</i>

699
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,825
<i>We are!</i>

700
00:50:43,658 --> 00:50:47,700
About 70% of district party chairmen
are for KIM Young-ho or LEE.

701
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,990
<i>KIM Young-ho KIM Woon-bum LEE Han-sang</i>

702
00:50:49,991 --> 00:50:52,741
The numbers don't look good.

703
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:58,075
There are times when emotion
matters more than numbers.

704
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:02,158
I came to a similar conclusion.

705
00:51:12,783 --> 00:51:16,200
<i>While they fight inside,
we will go outside.</i>

706
00:51:16,575 --> 00:51:20,657
The less factional delegates
who feel ignored by the center,

707
00:51:20,658 --> 00:51:22,699
we'll visit them in person.

708
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,491
<i>Train Tickets</i>

709
00:51:35,283 --> 00:51:37,700
Hello ma'am! Let me take that.

710
00:51:38,533 --> 00:51:40,490
How could you come all the way up here?

711
00:51:40,491 --> 00:51:42,574
I'd climb Mt. Baekdu if I had to.

712
00:51:42,575 --> 00:51:44,699
Oh my. Are you hot? Come in.

713
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:45,740
Hey!

714
00:51:45,741 --> 00:51:48,908
Sir! Sir!

715
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,490
Over here!

716
00:51:51,491 --> 00:51:55,325
Please, vote for Candidate #2.

717
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:00,450
How do you do?

718
00:52:01,283 --> 00:52:04,283
I'm here for Candidate KIM Woon-bum...

719
00:52:07,033 --> 00:52:09,241
<i>Gyeonggi Province 50</i>

720
00:52:09,491 --> 00:52:13,740
We're more concerned with ordinary
delegates than district chairmen.

721
00:52:13,741 --> 00:52:16,115
So please support...

722
00:52:16,116 --> 00:52:17,616
That's checkmate.

723
00:52:38,491 --> 00:52:39,991
<i>Chungcheong Province 34</i>

724
00:52:53,325 --> 00:52:54,325
Hello?

725
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:55,700
Yes!

726
00:52:56,991 --> 00:52:58,908
<i>Gangwon Province 27</i>

727
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:05,158
4 from Masan, 7 from
Ulsan, and 12 from Busan.

728
00:53:05,533 --> 00:53:07,283
That's 23 in total.

729
00:53:07,533 --> 00:53:12,408
Wow, he's even popular in Gyeongsang!

730
00:53:12,658 --> 00:53:14,325
It's a three-way fight.

731
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,949
KIM Young-ho and LEE
Han-sang will split the vote.

732
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:19,450
If we keep accumulating
votes one by one,

733
00:53:19,825 --> 00:53:21,491
we have a chance.

734
00:53:29,075 --> 00:53:32,241
You could've called,
why come in person?

735
00:53:32,491 --> 00:53:35,658
If I'd called, you'd
say I have no manners.

736
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,950
Then let's have a good-mannered talk.

737
00:53:42,366 --> 00:53:43,366
Sir.

738
00:53:45,408 --> 00:53:50,366
Isn't it better for me
to save face for you?

739
00:53:51,741 --> 00:53:53,991
I'll support your right
to choose the nominee.

740
00:53:54,908 --> 00:53:58,200
And you want me to pick you?

741
00:54:01,283 --> 00:54:04,450
You think of me as a back
room deal maker now.

742
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:10,825
The politics of compromise
won't change anything.

743
00:54:11,158 --> 00:54:13,325
That's why you call me a lapdog?

744
00:54:22,325 --> 00:54:26,575
Then let me ask you as your junior.

745
00:54:29,158 --> 00:54:32,241
Why do the Republicans
want to compete with you?

746
00:54:34,908 --> 00:54:35,908
Well?

747
00:54:40,033 --> 00:54:42,741
Take the right of
nomination and step aside.

748
00:54:43,158 --> 00:54:45,950
I'll protect your position
as party leader.

749
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:49,450
You don't get how to negotiate, do you?

750
00:54:50,233 --> 00:54:52,858
I'm already party leader,
so I've nothing to gain.

751
00:54:54,566 --> 00:54:58,191
Not the minority leader,
but the majority leader.

752
00:55:01,066 --> 00:55:05,691
I'm going to become South
Korea's 7th President.

753
00:55:09,191 --> 00:55:10,608
Hello!

754
00:55:11,191 --> 00:55:14,608
Why'd you want to meet here?
People could misunderstand.

755
00:55:15,108 --> 00:55:17,483
This is better than meeting in secret.

756
00:55:18,275 --> 00:55:19,941
Make it quick.

757
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:24,150
Next week, LEE Han-sang
is going to pull out.

758
00:55:25,275 --> 00:55:26,608
It's the party leader's doing.

759
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:29,358
We'll support KIM Young-ho.

760
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:32,858
What about LEE Han-sang?

761
00:55:32,859 --> 00:55:35,024
You can't do this to me!

762
00:55:35,025 --> 00:55:37,733
After you guys ganged up on me?

763
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:40,441
I can't do this to you?

764
00:55:41,691 --> 00:55:44,275
Pull out and I'll make
you floor leader.

765
00:55:44,566 --> 00:55:46,150
It's the most I can offer.

766
00:55:48,608 --> 00:55:53,233
Sir, I have my own followers.

767
00:55:54,733 --> 00:56:00,650
If it's you vs. me and KIM Young-ho,
will they still follow you?

768
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,900
<i>No one can beat those two.</i>

769
00:56:04,858 --> 00:56:09,858
If KIM Woon-bum backs out, surely
he'll get some apportioned seats.

770
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:15,483
Shouldn't you have your
own representative's badge?

771
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:19,315
If we back out and get
the apportioned seats,

772
00:56:19,316 --> 00:56:21,899
we'll be stronger for the
next election in 5 years.

773
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:25,190
If LEE Han-sang is out, it's 2 to 1.

774
00:56:25,191 --> 00:56:27,483
3 to 1 if you include KANG.

775
00:56:27,816 --> 00:56:30,732
Our only chance is to persuade
LEE Han-sang to join us.

776
00:56:30,733 --> 00:56:33,190
Why would a player like
Lee Han-sang do that?

777
00:56:33,191 --> 00:56:34,899
I can't believe this.

778
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:38,483
KIM Young-ho is
outmaneuvering everyone.

779
00:56:38,941 --> 00:56:44,316
Sir, if you withdraw too late,
you'll lose the apportioned seats.

780
00:56:50,608 --> 00:56:52,858
Secretary PARK is right.

781
00:56:55,733 --> 00:56:59,191
How encouraging. But what can I do?

782
00:57:00,066 --> 00:57:03,316
Even if I lose, I'm
in it until the end.

783
00:57:08,441 --> 00:57:10,608
You're not hoping for a seat, are you?

784
00:57:10,816 --> 00:57:12,275
That's not it, sir.

785
00:57:12,525 --> 00:57:13,775
Listen up.

786
00:57:14,316 --> 00:57:17,440
Putting ambition before
integrity will get you nowhere.

787
00:57:17,441 --> 00:57:20,983
Even if we lose, we'll preserve
our integrity. And if we win,

788
00:57:22,483 --> 00:57:27,691
I'll be the first to
give you that seat.

789
00:57:37,608 --> 00:57:41,274
We just need to win, what's the worry?

790
00:57:41,275 --> 00:57:42,066
That's right.

791
00:57:42,067 --> 00:57:47,732
Secretary PARK, if we win,
you'll be Representative Park.

792
00:57:47,733 --> 00:57:49,316
Exactly.

793
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:59,316
Mr. SEO, how about
you try to convince him?

794
00:57:59,483 --> 00:58:01,566
He listens to you.

795
00:58:04,858 --> 00:58:07,566
After calling me a vulgar Northerner.

796
00:58:07,816 --> 00:58:11,108
You're all worked up.
Worried about your seat.

797
00:58:14,316 --> 00:58:16,608
Hey!

798
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,566
Don't start again!

799
00:58:20,066 --> 00:58:23,483
At times like these we
need to band together!

800
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:37,608
- Welcome, sir.
- Hello.

801
00:58:43,483 --> 00:58:46,650
You've had a lot already.

802
00:58:46,941 --> 00:58:48,983
Yes, I drank a bit.

803
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,983
Then before you're
totally drunk, talk to me.

804
00:59:04,316 --> 00:59:05,316
What?

805
00:59:06,358 --> 00:59:09,775
You won't try persuading
me to drop out?

806
00:59:11,483 --> 00:59:13,400
How could I persuade you?

807
00:59:18,608 --> 00:59:20,650
So there's something else on your mind.

808
00:59:25,841 --> 00:59:27,425
You remember,

809
00:59:30,925 --> 00:59:34,591
when I said I didn't
want to be a fruit jar?

810
00:59:36,216 --> 00:59:40,258
Sure I do. I said you needed more time.

811
00:59:43,091 --> 00:59:45,841
Then does Secretary
PARK need more time?

812
00:59:51,341 --> 00:59:53,425
Do you want a seat, too?

813
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:57,591
I guess I don't qualify to even ask.

814
01:00:04,841 --> 01:00:06,050
At first,

815
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:12,300
I wanted to follow KIM Woon-bum,
who would change the world.

816
01:00:15,591 --> 01:00:17,300
When you won,

817
01:00:18,675 --> 01:00:21,591
it felt like I'd changed the world.

818
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:25,925
But the funny thing is,

819
01:00:27,841 --> 01:00:30,883
the more you won, as I watched you,

820
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:35,466
I wondered why no one knew me.

821
01:00:37,716 --> 01:00:40,091
I wanted to be like you someday.

822
01:00:44,466 --> 01:00:46,007
I know what you mean.

823
01:00:46,008 --> 01:00:48,216
No, you don't.

824
01:00:50,966 --> 01:00:55,216
A man like you will never know
what it is to live in a shadow.

825
01:00:58,008 --> 01:01:01,841
How could you know how it
feels to never show my face?

826
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:07,425
<i>On the Election to the
7th National Assembly</i>

827
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:14,508
I know they offered to
make you floor leader.

828
01:01:15,258 --> 01:01:18,758
If you join me, I can
offer you a bigger role.

829
01:01:20,633 --> 01:01:24,591
So if I endorse you for
the presidential nomination,

830
01:01:24,966 --> 01:01:27,300
you'll support me for party leader?

831
01:01:30,925 --> 01:01:36,341
You see me as a lightweight
after I dropped out.

832
01:01:37,258 --> 01:01:41,050
Why should I take that leap
when the result is so obvious?

833
01:01:42,050 --> 01:01:45,341
Politics is a moving organism.

834
01:01:45,883 --> 01:01:49,132
If you just sit and tell fortunes,
what kind of politics is that?

835
01:01:49,133 --> 01:01:51,966
Sir, don't be rude.

836
01:01:52,925 --> 01:01:54,550
Let's let them talk.

837
01:01:59,591 --> 01:02:03,175
Joining those who
currently hold power is easy.

838
01:02:04,008 --> 01:02:08,591
But better outcomes can
be found down rugged paths.

839
01:02:10,091 --> 01:02:16,508
But you're asking me to betray
both the floor leader and party head.

840
01:02:18,133 --> 01:02:22,675
I may feel upset, but they're
my political mentors

841
01:02:23,508 --> 01:02:25,008
and my comrades.

842
01:02:33,175 --> 01:02:34,841
What a pervert.

843
01:02:35,175 --> 01:02:37,466
Why did KIM Woon-bum hire such a...?

844
01:02:39,425 --> 01:02:40,758
What an earth...

845
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:42,508
Huh?

846
01:03:05,425 --> 01:03:06,508
Hello?

847
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,925
<i>Is this Representative LEE Han-sang?</i>

848
01:03:14,133 --> 01:03:17,883
Interesting name
card. No name or title.

849
01:03:19,383 --> 01:03:21,966
Are you KIM Woon-bum's shadow?

850
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:24,925
I don't like that nickname.

851
01:03:32,425 --> 01:03:36,590
"You can become party leader
without betraying anyone."

852
01:03:36,591 --> 01:03:38,341
What does that mean?

853
01:03:40,008 --> 01:03:41,508
Just what it says.

854
01:03:42,050 --> 01:03:46,383
Without betraying KIM Young-ho,
you can become party leader.

855
01:03:51,216 --> 01:03:53,841
Not sure why I should believe that.

856
01:03:54,841 --> 01:03:56,840
You're KIM Woon-bum's man.

857
01:03:56,841 --> 01:04:00,341
Don't believe in me, but my ambition.

858
01:04:01,633 --> 01:04:04,425
<i>Your ambition to become
more than just floor leader,</i>

859
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:08,008
and my ambition to lose the
nickname Shadow is the same.

860
01:04:09,841 --> 01:04:11,925
That's more believable.

861
01:04:13,133 --> 01:04:16,925
<i>Meet me and I'll tell you a
foolproof plan, however...</i>

862
01:04:17,758 --> 01:04:22,716
when you become party leader,
I want a representative's seat.

863
01:04:27,716 --> 01:04:31,216
<i>New Democratic Party Convention</i>

864
01:04:36,216 --> 01:04:42,425
Welcome to the New
Democratic Party Convention!

865
01:04:52,675 --> 01:05:00,799
Today we select the party's nominee for the
1971 presidential election via secret ballot.

866
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,758
I'll go get some air.

867
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:05,341
Not feeling well?

868
01:05:25,216 --> 01:05:26,215
<i>Ballot Box</i>

869
01:05:26,216 --> 01:05:29,091
Delegates, thank you for your votes.

870
01:05:30,175 --> 01:05:33,758
Now we will announce the results.

871
01:05:46,716 --> 01:05:48,216
KIM Young-ho!

872
01:05:51,050 --> 01:05:53,050
421 votes!

873
01:05:57,341 --> 01:05:58,800
KIM Woon-bum!

874
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:02,633
382 votes!

875
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:12,050
Please quiet down.

876
01:06:15,175 --> 01:06:17,008
Blank ballots, 78 votes!

877
01:06:27,933 --> 01:06:31,850
With neither candidate
holding an absolute majority,

878
01:06:31,875 --> 01:06:35,166
a second round of voting
will be held in 30 minutes.

879
01:06:38,183 --> 01:06:40,183
This round's invalid.

880
01:06:43,475 --> 01:06:44,891
Hey, LEE Han-sang!

881
01:06:45,141 --> 01:06:46,058
Hey, LEE Han-sang!

882
01:06:46,059 --> 01:06:47,682
Who cast the blank votes?

883
01:06:47,683 --> 01:06:48,683
Hey!

884
01:06:50,183 --> 01:06:53,641
<i>Tell your supporters
to cast blank ballots.</i>

885
01:06:54,308 --> 01:06:56,183
Then we go to a second round.

886
01:06:56,725 --> 01:07:00,225
If that happens, KIM
Young-ho will panic.

887
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:02,891
Your votes become more valuable.

888
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:05,475
So make a deal for
the party leadership?

889
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:09,141
He's already promised that to KANG.

890
01:07:09,391 --> 01:07:13,933
In a crisis, verbal
promises are often broken.

891
01:07:14,266 --> 01:07:20,225
He'd offer not just a
deal, but his own heart.

892
01:07:21,225 --> 01:07:23,433
Representative LEE!

893
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,850
How could you do this?

894
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:32,475
Who made me quit in the first place?

895
01:07:34,475 --> 01:07:36,183
What is it that you want?

896
01:07:38,225 --> 01:07:40,766
Let's go someplace private.

897
01:07:47,225 --> 01:07:49,474
Where is that scoundrel LEE Han-sang?

898
01:07:49,475 --> 01:07:50,766
Sir.

899
01:07:57,641 --> 01:07:58,891
You go ahead.

900
01:08:05,475 --> 01:08:08,975
KIM Young-ho said he'll
give you whatever you want.

901
01:08:09,516 --> 01:08:11,350
Words aren't enough.

902
01:08:11,766 --> 01:08:14,516
But the vote's about to start.

903
01:08:17,850 --> 01:08:24,641
I need a signed pledge that KIM
will support me for party leader.

904
01:08:26,558 --> 01:08:28,433
You better move quick.

905
01:08:29,183 --> 01:08:30,641
Hey, LEE Han-sang!

906
01:08:31,558 --> 01:08:36,057
However backhanded a
business politics may be,

907
01:08:36,058 --> 01:08:37,308
this is outrageous!

908
01:08:38,433 --> 01:08:39,225
Sir...

909
01:08:39,226 --> 01:08:41,308
And the same for KIM Young-ho!

910
01:08:42,975 --> 01:08:45,515
Sir, you misunderstand.

911
01:08:45,516 --> 01:08:47,515
Go tell KIM Young-ho.

912
01:08:47,516 --> 01:08:50,350
He has to choose between
you and me as party leader.

913
01:08:50,808 --> 01:08:53,600
You bunch of damned novices!

914
01:08:54,850 --> 01:08:56,808
Sir! Sir!

915
01:08:58,475 --> 01:08:59,891
Representative LEE!

916
01:09:00,558 --> 01:09:03,599
If you want to be floor leader,
vote for KIM Young-ho.

917
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,600
I need to go talk to KANG.

918
01:09:06,641 --> 01:09:07,641
Sir!

919
01:09:07,933 --> 01:09:08,933
Sir!

920
01:09:23,391 --> 01:09:24,516
You bastard.

921
01:09:25,058 --> 01:09:27,058
You don't believe him, do you?

922
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,600
You betrayed them once already.

923
01:09:29,975 --> 01:09:32,516
If they can't trust you, why
make you floor leader?

924
01:09:33,558 --> 01:09:34,683
What?

925
01:09:40,558 --> 01:09:42,475
What are you scheming at?

926
01:09:44,225 --> 01:09:47,475
Vote for KIM Woon-bum.

927
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,641
Wow.

928
01:09:58,683 --> 01:10:02,308
That was a nice effort.

929
01:10:03,516 --> 01:10:05,058
But nothing's changed.

930
01:10:05,766 --> 01:10:08,808
I'm less likely than
ever to vote for him.

931
01:10:10,725 --> 01:10:13,350
This is a signed pledge
from KIM Woon-bum.

932
01:10:24,433 --> 01:10:29,350
<i>If I am nominated for president, at the next party
assembly, I promise to support Lee Han-sang as party leader.</i>

933
01:10:34,725 --> 01:10:36,850
I already turned this down.

934
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:39,641
You think I'd accept it after all this?

935
01:10:40,191 --> 01:10:43,066
Then why'd you take the card?

936
01:10:46,191 --> 01:10:49,441
Don't overestimate curiosity.

937
01:10:51,025 --> 01:10:55,025
You think I'll be swindled by
some nameless hack twice?

938
01:11:01,775 --> 01:11:02,983
You lost.

939
01:11:03,441 --> 01:11:06,816
The choice is yours.

940
01:11:26,316 --> 01:11:30,275
The second round of voting is over.

941
01:11:31,483 --> 01:11:35,525
Now we will announce the results.

942
01:11:48,608 --> 01:11:50,775
KIM Young-ho!

943
01:12:29,108 --> 01:12:31,024
By 46 votes,

944
01:12:31,025 --> 01:12:37,441
KIM Woon-bum has been chosen
as the presidential nominee!

945
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:48,608
KIM Woon-bum! KIM Woon-bum!

946
01:12:50,025 --> 01:12:55,358
<i>The stronger a light shines,
the darker the shadow.</i>

947
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:02,525
<i>But I like seeing you in the light.</i>

948
01:13:42,316 --> 01:13:45,400
My gosh, you beat me good today.

949
01:13:46,150 --> 01:13:47,733
Congratulations.

950
01:13:49,483 --> 01:13:50,608
Thank you.

951
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:11,816
KIM Woon-bum! KIM Woon-bum!

952
01:14:19,816 --> 01:14:24,483
My victory today is not
an individual victory,

953
01:14:25,858 --> 01:14:29,815
but a victory for the New Democratic
Party and 30 million citizens.

954
01:14:29,816 --> 01:14:31,150
<i>Tell me.</i>

955
01:14:31,608 --> 01:14:34,441
<i>You remember what you
said when we first met?</i>

956
01:14:35,191 --> 01:14:37,358
<i>You want to change the world.</i>

957
01:14:38,816 --> 01:14:42,566
<i>A world where innocent people
aren't persecuted as communists,</i>

958
01:14:43,275 --> 01:14:45,650
<i>where you can speak without fear,</i>

959
01:14:45,941 --> 01:14:49,525
<i>where the nation doesn't
force sacrifice on its people.</i>

960
01:14:50,150 --> 01:14:54,775
<i>Creating such a world
is my biggest goal.</i>

961
01:14:56,150 --> 01:15:00,108
At this moment, a new era is opening.

962
01:15:01,066 --> 01:15:02,983
The people must rule.

963
01:15:03,858 --> 01:15:05,983
It's time to create
the age of the people.

964
01:15:06,566 --> 01:15:08,815
Freedom, prosperity and well-being!

965
01:15:08,816 --> 01:15:11,316
We will usher in the
age of reunification!

966
01:15:11,608 --> 01:15:15,608
I will stand at the
head of this new era,

967
01:15:16,358 --> 01:15:21,983
and fight for the people's
freedom and happiness!

968
01:15:22,566 --> 01:15:25,233
When did I say that?

969
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:29,691
Sir!

970
01:15:31,066 --> 01:15:34,108
Can I have a hug from
the future president?

971
01:15:36,025 --> 01:15:37,233
You're drunk.

972
01:15:46,941 --> 01:15:48,191
Congratulations.

973
01:15:49,191 --> 01:15:50,650
Good work.

974
01:16:01,483 --> 01:16:04,108
Are you ready for this?

975
01:16:05,275 --> 01:16:06,441
What?

976
01:16:06,733 --> 01:16:08,650
To emerge from the shadows.

977
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:13,649
After the presidential
election is the general election.

978
01:16:13,650 --> 01:16:16,941
That would be a good time
to realize your ambitions.

979
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:19,566
Oh, I'm...

980
01:16:20,108 --> 01:16:22,899
Damn, you're not ready!

981
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:25,983
No, no, I'm ready! I'm so ready, sir.

982
01:16:26,816 --> 01:16:29,149
We need to start a completely new era.

983
01:16:29,150 --> 01:16:32,525
This election will be a
fight over policy and vision.

984
01:16:34,941 --> 01:16:37,941
You're ridiculously smart.

985
01:16:38,858 --> 01:16:42,608
You're a natural at reading
a situation and winning.

986
01:16:45,733 --> 01:16:49,150
But what's important is not how to win,

987
01:16:50,233 --> 01:16:52,691
but why you have to win.

988
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:56,233
Yes, I'll remember that.

989
01:17:10,566 --> 01:17:19,316
<i>KIM Woon-bum can't do
it. The people can do it.</i>

990
01:17:27,733 --> 01:17:30,524
- Oh, Chief SEO.
- Hello!

991
01:17:30,525 --> 01:17:32,441
You look sharp today.

992
01:17:34,941 --> 01:17:37,940
Are you ready for the trip to America?

993
01:17:37,941 --> 01:17:40,649
Yeah, we're talking to the embassy.

994
01:17:40,650 --> 01:17:43,608
SEO... I mean, Chief
SEO, you're going, too?

995
01:17:43,816 --> 01:17:44,650
Yes.

996
01:17:44,733 --> 01:17:47,858
Sure enough, our king maker is special.

997
01:17:48,441 --> 01:17:52,440
In Washington we'll meet Secretary
of State Rogers and Senator Kennedy.

998
01:17:52,441 --> 01:17:55,025
Wow, it's like a dream.

999
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:58,066
And later, please help me out.

1000
01:17:59,108 --> 01:18:02,650
Among us, the one who
will go the farthest is...

1001
01:18:03,566 --> 01:18:05,066
...Secretary PARK.

1002
01:18:19,525 --> 01:18:20,358
Mr. SEO.

1003
01:18:20,358 --> 01:18:21,358
Yes?

1004
01:18:23,483 --> 01:18:25,316
If you go to America,

1005
01:18:26,483 --> 01:18:28,650
can you buy my son a present?

1006
01:18:33,275 --> 01:18:34,275
Sure.

1007
01:18:48,358 --> 01:18:52,441
I won't engage in one-sided
attacks on the government.

1008
01:18:53,483 --> 01:18:56,525
I have this image as a fighter,

1009
01:18:56,858 --> 01:18:59,691
but I'm actually quite mild-mannered.

1010
01:19:01,233 --> 01:19:05,774
Well, hearing you say that,
let's move on to discuss policy.

1011
01:19:05,775 --> 01:19:10,691
You propose to eliminate
the homeland reserve forces.

1012
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:14,065
As for me, I don't
see the sense in that.

1013
01:19:14,066 --> 01:19:17,857
For a divided nation like ours
to eliminate reserve forces,

1014
01:19:17,858 --> 01:19:19,482
is that really sensible?

1015
01:19:19,483 --> 01:19:21,150
That son of a bitch!

1016
01:19:24,066 --> 01:19:25,775
Thank you for asking.

1017
01:19:26,858 --> 01:19:29,274
The original purpose
of the reserve forces

1018
01:19:29,275 --> 01:19:32,650
was to protect against
a North Korean invasion.

1019
01:19:33,316 --> 01:19:37,358
This is being carried out by citizens.

1020
01:19:37,691 --> 01:19:40,065
Using security as bait,

1021
01:19:40,066 --> 01:19:44,483
the government puts citizens in
the military to serve its own ends.

1022
01:19:44,733 --> 01:19:47,275
We've moved quite far
from its original purpose.

1023
01:19:47,691 --> 01:19:51,733
Maintaining a policy after
its purpose has changed,

1024
01:19:52,691 --> 01:19:54,691
<i>do you consider that sensible?</i>

1025
01:20:11,816 --> 01:20:13,858
Call the Secretary of Defense

1026
01:20:15,025 --> 01:20:17,400
and get an estimate of
the North's military power.

1027
01:20:24,575 --> 01:20:29,115
<i>North Korea has trained
a million-man red militia,</i>

1028
01:20:29,116 --> 01:20:31,990
<i>the same size as their standing
army, plus 30,000 guerillas.</i>

1029
01:20:31,991 --> 01:20:35,324
<i>KIM Woon-bum's plan to
disband the reserve forces</i>

1030
01:20:35,325 --> 01:20:38,157
<i>is a treasonous invitation
to Kim Il-sung to invade!</i>

1031
01:20:38,158 --> 01:20:41,407
<i>If KIM Woon-bum plays
his pipe, Kim Il-sung dances!</i>

1032
01:20:41,408 --> 01:20:44,365
<i>If Kim Il-sung strikes the drum,
KIM Woon-bum matches his beat!</i>

1033
01:20:44,366 --> 01:20:50,241
Those bastards are stirring
up security panic over my policy,

1034
01:20:50,616 --> 01:20:54,740
but if we drop one policy for
every foolish attack of theirs,

1035
01:20:54,741 --> 01:20:55,865
what kind of reform is that?

1036
01:20:55,866 --> 01:21:00,740
You know our people, just the word
communist gives them nightmares.

1037
01:21:00,741 --> 01:21:04,032
But caving in now makes us look weak.

1038
01:21:04,033 --> 01:21:08,032
Professor KANG, you want us to
keep being called pro-communist?

1039
01:21:08,033 --> 01:21:11,283
That's right, the Republicans
won't let go of this.

1040
01:21:14,491 --> 01:21:16,491
Chief SEO, you're quiet.

1041
01:21:17,783 --> 01:21:20,200
Yes, the policy itself
is innovative and good.

1042
01:21:20,575 --> 01:21:23,616
But it was announced too soon.
We gave them time to hit back.

1043
01:21:23,908 --> 01:21:26,365
It would've been better
just before the vote.

1044
01:21:26,366 --> 01:21:29,283
That's water under the bridge now.

1045
01:21:30,658 --> 01:21:32,365
Hurry up and withdraw the policy.

1046
01:21:32,366 --> 01:21:34,865
All the nation is angry about this.

1047
01:21:34,866 --> 01:21:37,241
There's a way to deflect that anger.

1048
01:21:43,908 --> 01:21:49,241
You all remember the acetate
attack on KIM Young-ho last year?

1049
01:21:52,491 --> 01:21:54,700
<i>It's masterminded
by central intelligence.</i>

1050
01:21:55,033 --> 01:21:58,699
They thought it would
scare him off, but it didn't.

1051
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:03,158
<i>The hand behind this dictatorship
is central intelligence!</i>

1052
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:07,866
<i>This plot by the
government to rub me out</i>

1053
01:22:08,283 --> 01:22:10,658
<i>will not make me back down!</i>

1054
01:22:11,241 --> 01:22:15,408
You know how much his
approval ratings went up?

1055
01:22:15,950 --> 01:22:18,991
We need a similar incident.

1056
01:22:26,741 --> 01:22:29,033
Are you suggesting we stage a show?

1057
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:31,782
Sometimes politicians
need to stage a show.

1058
01:22:31,783 --> 01:22:34,532
Don't take this sitting down,
we'll fabricate some gossip...

1059
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:36,283
Representative PARK!

1060
01:22:37,158 --> 01:22:41,616
If you want to stage a show,
you should join the circus!

1061
01:22:47,533 --> 01:22:49,574
If it's too soon to disband
the reserve forces,

1062
01:22:49,575 --> 01:22:52,200
then we can restructure
it into a defense corps.

1063
01:22:52,991 --> 01:22:56,491
Not just change the name,
but reform the entire system.

1064
01:22:56,741 --> 01:22:59,741
Even when it was
established 3 years ago...

1065
01:23:12,950 --> 01:23:14,075
Chief SEO.

1066
01:23:15,241 --> 01:23:16,241
Yes?

1067
01:23:18,866 --> 01:23:23,450
I don't think you're ready yet.

1068
01:23:35,283 --> 01:23:39,825
<i>I'd better take Secretary
PARK with me to America.</i>

1069
01:23:40,491 --> 01:23:42,991
<i>You stay at the party headquarters.</i>

1070
01:23:56,741 --> 01:23:59,741
<i>2nd day of KIM Woon-bum's US visit</i>

1071
01:24:10,908 --> 01:24:15,324
<i>Last night during nominee
KIM Woon-bum's trip to the U.S.,</i>

1072
01:24:15,325 --> 01:24:18,450
<i>a mysterious explosion
occurred at his residence.</i>

1073
01:24:18,925 --> 01:24:24,008
<i>His mother and nephew
were both home at the time,</i>

1074
01:24:24,033 --> 01:24:26,116
<i>but no injuries were reported.</i>

1075
01:24:26,491 --> 01:24:28,949
Nothing's been determined yet.

1076
01:24:28,950 --> 01:24:31,325
We're still looking into it.

1077
01:24:32,208 --> 01:24:33,250
All right.

1078
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:38,290
Where have you been?

1079
01:24:38,291 --> 01:24:39,708
Come to the meeting room.

1080
01:24:43,583 --> 01:24:46,708
I'll speak directly. Who did this?

1081
01:24:47,208 --> 01:24:50,208
How could the police do it?

1082
01:24:50,708 --> 01:24:54,416
Only central intelligence is capable.

1083
01:24:55,791 --> 01:25:00,332
But you think they're so stupid?
It's obvious what Mr. KIM will say.

1084
01:25:00,333 --> 01:25:02,041
Then who is it?

1085
01:25:02,333 --> 01:25:04,916
If not us, who would do such a thing?

1086
01:25:10,208 --> 01:25:13,375
No, use stronger language here.

1087
01:25:13,583 --> 01:25:16,874
This is a heinous act committed
by central intelligence...

1088
01:25:16,875 --> 01:25:18,333
Let me do it.

1089
01:25:18,875 --> 01:25:21,124
Isn't that too strong for a statement?

1090
01:25:21,125 --> 01:25:23,124
We don't even know who did it.

1091
01:25:23,125 --> 01:25:26,125
It doesn't matter who did it,
it matters what it looks like.

1092
01:25:28,083 --> 01:25:29,083
What?

1093
01:25:29,916 --> 01:25:30,916
Nothing.

1094
01:25:31,083 --> 01:25:32,541
Confiscate everything!

1095
01:25:32,625 --> 01:25:33,416
What's going on?

1096
01:25:33,417 --> 01:25:35,166
Don’t miss one single thing.

1097
01:25:35,833 --> 01:25:37,040
Not even one, got it?

1098
01:25:37,041 --> 01:25:39,041
Put it down and step back please.

1099
01:25:41,333 --> 01:25:43,207
What are you doing here?

1100
01:25:43,208 --> 01:25:44,707
I said don’t touch it.

1101
01:25:44,708 --> 01:25:46,208
Mr. SEO Chang-dae?

1102
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:49,249
- Get your hands off me!
- They've taken him!

1103
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:52,624
<i>In regard to the explosion
at KIM Woon-bum's house,</i>

1104
01:25:52,625 --> 01:25:55,874
<i>police are investigating
KIM's own associates,</i>

1105
01:25:55,875 --> 01:25:57,666
<i>and have taken them
in for questioning.</i>

1106
01:25:57,916 --> 01:26:01,832
<i>Suspecting a self-fabricated plot,</i>

1107
01:26:01,833 --> 01:26:06,750
<i>police have zeroed in on lawmakers
and staff members close to KIM.</i>

1108
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:16,875
Keep SEO, and release the
others after questioning.

1109
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,125
Yes, sir.

1110
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:25,915
Who do you think is
behind the explosion?

1111
01:26:25,916 --> 01:26:28,166
Did you complete your US itinerary?

1112
01:26:28,541 --> 01:26:30,041
Please answer!

1113
01:26:30,458 --> 01:26:33,250
Did you obtain good
results in the U.S.?

1114
01:26:33,583 --> 01:26:35,458
How do you feel?

1115
01:26:35,666 --> 01:26:38,000
The police are
fabricating this whole thing.

1116
01:26:38,208 --> 01:26:40,750
They even dragged
me in for questioning.

1117
01:26:41,258 --> 01:26:42,465
And Chief SEO?

1118
01:26:42,466 --> 01:26:44,175
They still have him.

1119
01:26:45,258 --> 01:26:47,175
This is central intelligence's doing.

1120
01:26:47,466 --> 01:26:49,800
Since I was meeting people in the U.S.,

1121
01:26:50,008 --> 01:26:51,966
they did this to bring me back.

1122
01:26:52,133 --> 01:26:53,425
I'll fight them.

1123
01:26:54,341 --> 01:26:58,300
You remember when SEO
suggested staging a show?

1124
01:26:59,916 --> 01:27:01,333
You suspect him?

1125
01:27:02,375 --> 01:27:03,833
What's certain is,

1126
01:27:04,708 --> 01:27:08,500
when the bomb went
off, he wasn't at the office.

1127
01:27:08,666 --> 01:27:12,374
Suspecting someone for being absent
is to push a drowning man underwater.

1128
01:27:12,375 --> 01:27:14,375
I'm just telling you the truth.

1129
01:27:15,291 --> 01:27:17,416
Let's not all accuse each other.

1130
01:27:20,458 --> 01:27:22,249
I'll know it when I meet him.

1131
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:25,499
This isn't for you to do.

1132
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:27,165
You expect me to just sit still?

1133
01:27:27,166 --> 01:27:28,916
Don't act rashly!

1134
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:30,665
They took my man.

1135
01:27:30,666 --> 01:27:33,333
He's not yours anymore.

1136
01:27:37,291 --> 01:27:38,041
What?

1137
01:27:38,042 --> 01:27:42,208
The election is soon, don't
give them an advantage.

1138
01:27:42,583 --> 01:27:44,875
- Because of that idiot...
- He's my comrade!

1139
01:27:45,666 --> 01:27:48,208
He's fought with me
from the very beginning.

1140
01:27:49,083 --> 01:27:53,375
Without finding out the
truth, I can't let him go.

1141
01:27:54,125 --> 01:27:56,833
I know how much you care about him.

1142
01:27:58,166 --> 01:28:00,416
And how much he's done for you.

1143
01:28:01,166 --> 01:28:05,958
But you need to understand
your position right now.

1144
01:28:07,291 --> 01:28:10,500
To end dictatorship and
bring in democracy...

1145
01:28:11,208 --> 01:28:14,583
That's what everyone
here is fighting for.

1146
01:28:19,041 --> 01:28:20,958
But I can't abandon him.

1147
01:28:22,583 --> 01:28:24,666
Then instead of you,

1148
01:28:26,333 --> 01:28:30,208
how about the party leader
takes action, for all of us?

1149
01:28:31,333 --> 01:28:33,416
You people are really something.

1150
01:28:33,833 --> 01:28:38,791
Okay, I'll try talking to him.

1151
01:29:06,541 --> 01:29:09,291
I read this with true admiration.

1152
01:29:13,458 --> 01:29:15,375
I really like you.

1153
01:29:18,916 --> 01:29:23,916
If you think it over, I'm
sure we can both win.

1154
01:29:28,708 --> 01:29:32,708
Someone needs to lose for
winning to mean anything.

1155
01:29:37,583 --> 01:29:41,375
All right, then. It's time
for you to go home.

1156
01:29:44,166 --> 01:29:45,583
What are you scheming at?

1157
01:29:46,166 --> 01:29:47,666
We caught the culprit.

1158
01:29:48,916 --> 01:29:51,708
The nominee's nephew, Jung-shik.

1159
01:29:52,041 --> 01:29:54,958
He was playing around with gunpowder.

1160
01:29:55,375 --> 01:29:57,250
He's in middle school,

1161
01:29:57,791 --> 01:29:59,125
so he's at that age.

1162
01:30:01,208 --> 01:30:03,458
You expect me to believe that?

1163
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,416
You sound like you
know the real criminal.

1164
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:52,416
KANG just barely stopped them
from pinning it on our camp.

1165
01:30:56,708 --> 01:30:58,791
I'm curious how he did that.

1166
01:31:02,916 --> 01:31:04,916
What deal did he make?

1167
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:11,083
It seems they were targeting you.

1168
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,375
In the future, whatever you
do they'll respond in this way.

1169
01:31:20,583 --> 01:31:23,750
So you want me to drop out?

1170
01:31:25,708 --> 01:31:28,915
It seems they're
uncomfortable with you.

1171
01:31:28,916 --> 01:31:31,000
And our side feels the same.

1172
01:31:37,791 --> 01:31:39,791
Then what am I supposed to do?

1173
01:31:40,958 --> 01:31:42,875
I have to give up my seat, too?

1174
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:48,291
Last time too, I called you back again.

1175
01:31:48,416 --> 01:31:49,416
No.

1176
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
That was completely different.

1177
01:31:54,375 --> 01:31:56,166
Now, your dream...

1178
01:31:57,458 --> 01:31:59,541
My dream is right in front of my eyes.

1179
01:32:01,333 --> 01:32:05,708
This issue isn't something
I can decide on my own.

1180
01:32:06,208 --> 01:32:08,207
As the nominee, I speak for the party.

1181
01:32:08,208 --> 01:32:10,541
I'm the one who got you there!

1182
01:32:12,958 --> 01:32:13,958
What?

1183
01:32:15,208 --> 01:32:17,333
You think you did it on your own?

1184
01:32:22,083 --> 01:32:24,291
Don't I hold a share of your position?

1185
01:32:25,833 --> 01:32:28,833
This position isn't something
you divide up for profit.

1186
01:32:30,775 --> 01:32:33,566
Don't let ambition sweep
away your principles.

1187
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:37,483
It wasn't you or me who put me here.

1188
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:39,941
It was the people.

1189
01:32:49,808 --> 01:32:52,808
Save those showy phrases
for your speeches.

1190
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:56,941
The people? Who are they?

1191
01:32:58,025 --> 01:33:01,900
They just believe, listen to, or
do the things you tell them to.

1192
01:33:06,775 --> 01:33:08,440
How can you be so arrogant?

1193
01:33:08,441 --> 01:33:11,233
Who are these people anyway?

1194
01:33:12,525 --> 01:33:13,565
It's just an illusion.

1195
01:33:13,566 --> 01:33:17,691
Then who led the
revolution in April 1960?

1196
01:33:18,275 --> 01:33:22,524
Who risked their lives to resist
Japanese colonial rule in 1919?

1197
01:33:22,525 --> 01:33:24,525
And was the world changed?

1198
01:33:25,650 --> 01:33:27,775
We still live in a dictatorship,

1199
01:33:28,983 --> 01:33:32,191
and those former collaborators
are still rich and powerful.

1200
01:33:33,775 --> 01:33:36,441
The reason they can do
that is the damned people!

1201
01:33:38,316 --> 01:33:43,400
Then, how are we any
different from them?

1202
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:48,066
They were wrong and we're
right. That's the difference.

1203
01:33:50,525 --> 01:33:52,357
Isn't that why we've been fighting?

1204
01:33:52,358 --> 01:33:53,358
No.

1205
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:57,775
You're talking about a fight to win.

1206
01:33:58,358 --> 01:34:01,941
With no greater cause,
just us against them.

1207
01:34:02,233 --> 01:34:04,733
Just because they're wrong
doesn't mean we're right.

1208
01:34:05,441 --> 01:34:08,483
If you care more about
the means than the goal,

1209
01:34:08,941 --> 01:34:12,108
you can justify dictatorship
or even treason.

1210
01:34:15,775 --> 01:34:19,358
It's not that you aren't ready,

1211
01:34:21,108 --> 01:34:23,316
someone like you shouldn't do politics.

1212
01:34:24,691 --> 01:34:25,816
Ever.

1213
01:34:31,525 --> 01:34:32,525
Wow.

1214
01:34:34,650 --> 01:34:36,733
Now the truth comes out.

1215
01:34:41,566 --> 01:34:43,150
But you know what?

1216
01:34:46,566 --> 01:34:49,483
You used me in order to win.

1217
01:34:55,608 --> 01:34:56,608
I know.

1218
01:35:12,358 --> 01:35:19,608
When the explosive went off, my
mother and nephew were home.

1219
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:27,691
Did you do it?

1220
01:35:45,316 --> 01:35:46,316
Yes.

1221
01:35:48,483 --> 01:35:49,691
I did it.

1222
01:35:52,941 --> 01:35:55,441
That's all I know how to do.

1223
01:35:59,775 --> 01:36:05,233
In order to make the great,
conscientious KIM Woon-bum president,

1224
01:36:06,566 --> 01:36:09,441
this vulgar con man did the job.

1225
01:36:29,191 --> 01:36:30,358
Thank you.

1226
01:36:33,983 --> 01:36:36,983
I was feeling so bad about doing this,

1227
01:36:38,066 --> 01:36:42,400
but now you made it easy

1228
01:36:44,275 --> 01:36:46,150
for me to fire you.

1229
01:37:00,858 --> 01:37:03,608
<i>The students' revolution
was on April 19!</i>

1230
01:37:03,858 --> 01:37:06,025
<i>And the coup on May 16!</i>

1231
01:37:06,650 --> 01:37:12,025
<i>Now on April 27, with
the people's help,</i>

1232
01:37:12,525 --> 01:37:17,316
<i>this nation for the first
time in 5000 years</i>

1233
01:37:17,608 --> 01:37:20,024
<i>will achieve a democratic revolution,</i>

1234
01:37:20,025 --> 01:37:24,191
<i>by bringing about a peaceful
change of government.</i>

1235
01:37:24,483 --> 01:37:29,608
<i>And with the support of all
of you rallied here today,</i>

1236
01:37:29,816 --> 01:37:36,107
<i>I am going to win this
presidential election!</i>

1237
01:37:36,108 --> 01:37:39,608
<i>A million people gathered
for KIM Woon-bum's speech!</i>

1238
01:37:41,775 --> 01:37:45,525
But you people expect me
to believe that I'm winning?

1239
01:37:47,483 --> 01:37:49,191
520 billion won...

1240
01:37:49,733 --> 01:37:52,358
That's the national
budget for this year!

1241
01:37:54,441 --> 01:37:56,775
How much are we spending
on the election?

1242
01:37:57,233 --> 01:37:59,400
About 70 billion won, sir.

1243
01:38:02,858 --> 01:38:07,191
This wretched election is burning
up 10% of the national budget.

1244
01:38:07,650 --> 01:38:10,733
So who here can
explain why we're losing?

1245
01:38:10,941 --> 01:38:12,941
<i>They've held power for too long.</i>

1246
01:38:13,525 --> 01:38:16,150
You know what I hear?

1247
01:38:16,358 --> 01:38:21,108
Many people are tired
of this long-term rule.

1248
01:38:21,316 --> 01:38:24,815
There is also great
support for your policies.

1249
01:38:24,816 --> 01:38:26,732
We should contact the president

1250
01:38:26,733 --> 01:38:29,191
and propose a joint event
or televised debate.

1251
01:38:29,441 --> 01:38:31,608
Don't accept that under
any circumstance!

1252
01:38:31,983 --> 01:38:34,775
Debating KIM Woon-bum
will bring nothing but trouble.

1253
01:38:35,108 --> 01:38:39,690
Let's use the media to argue
his policies are too expensive.

1254
01:38:39,691 --> 01:38:40,983
No.

1255
01:38:42,608 --> 01:38:46,316
Then it becomes an election
on policy, we'll lose.

1256
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:51,983
Secretary LEE, don't just
diagnose, prescribe!

1257
01:38:52,775 --> 01:38:57,400
Mr. President, your home region
Gyeongsang is much bigger than KIM's.

1258
01:39:00,108 --> 01:39:01,816
Stoke regional rivalry?

1259
01:39:03,691 --> 01:39:04,691
How?

1260
01:39:04,983 --> 01:39:08,315
- Shake things up, sir!
- Thank you.

1261
01:39:08,316 --> 01:39:09,316
Sir!

1262
01:39:09,317 --> 01:39:13,190
Is it true you'll fire Gyeongsang
civil servants if you get elected?

1263
01:39:13,191 --> 01:39:14,399
That's ridiculous!

1264
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:16,899
He'll favor his own region!

1265
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:17,940
What did you say?

1266
01:39:17,941 --> 01:39:18,941
I heard it!

1267
01:39:19,900 --> 01:39:21,566
You Jeolla crook!

1268
01:39:23,191 --> 01:39:24,775
All of you listen!

1269
01:39:25,066 --> 01:39:27,190
He's a Jeolla stooge out
to cut off all our benefits!

1270
01:39:27,191 --> 01:39:30,566
<i>Strange banners are appearing all
throughout Gyeongsang Province.</i>

1271
01:39:30,858 --> 01:39:32,566
<i>We're checking on it.</i>

1272
01:39:45,941 --> 01:39:47,566
What is all this?

1273
01:39:55,275 --> 01:39:58,315
These are meant to look
like they're supporting us.

1274
01:39:58,316 --> 01:39:59,774
<i>People of Jeolla, rise up!</i>

1275
01:39:59,775 --> 01:40:01,482
<i>President only favors Gyeongsang!</i>

1276
01:40:01,483 --> 01:40:03,315
<i>Break Gyeongsang's
industrial monopolies!</i>

1277
01:40:03,316 --> 01:40:05,900
<i>A Jeolla patriot doesn't
buy Gyeongsang products!</i>

1278
01:40:08,316 --> 01:40:11,315
Busan, Ulsan, Daegu, Gumi, Changwon...

1279
01:40:11,316 --> 01:40:14,421
<i>Fury Towards Jeolla
Grows in Gyeongsang</i>

1280
01:40:14,422 --> 01:40:17,316
Banners are being hung in
every free spot in Gyeongsang.

1281
01:40:17,983 --> 01:40:20,400
But the President
is still not convinced.

1282
01:40:21,108 --> 01:40:24,150
We're not a huge country like America.

1283
01:40:24,566 --> 01:40:28,150
There's never been strong regional
identification in Korean politics.

1284
01:40:28,733 --> 01:40:30,066
Yes there is.

1285
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:32,900
You can see it right there.

1286
01:40:34,566 --> 01:40:38,565
Since I've joined the loaded
side, let's use our bullets.

1287
01:40:38,566 --> 01:40:41,274
<i>If any coward tries to run away,</i>

1288
01:40:41,275 --> 01:40:44,274
<i>I'll wring the necks of
even your neighbors.</i>

1289
01:40:44,275 --> 01:40:48,316
<i>If the villains in TV dramas
are all Jeolla residents,</i>

1290
01:40:48,858 --> 01:40:52,546
<i>or if the news emphasizes criminals'
Jeolla backgrounds, that will help.</i>

1291
01:40:52,547 --> 01:40:55,233
<i>Crime Trio From Jeolla</i>

1292
01:40:58,233 --> 01:41:01,191
Jeolla vs. Gyeongsang
sounds too obvious.

1293
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:04,400
Let's describe it as Silla vs. Baekje.

1294
01:41:05,275 --> 01:41:06,483
Classical.

1295
01:41:07,566 --> 01:41:11,691
It's not classical,
it's ancient history.

1296
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:13,566
No.

1297
01:41:16,150 --> 01:41:17,608
It'll still work.

1298
01:41:19,191 --> 01:41:21,566
Old people love history.

1299
01:41:22,691 --> 01:41:24,482
Return of the Three Kingdoms.

1300
01:41:24,483 --> 01:41:27,025
Which of the three kingdoms
united this country?

1301
01:41:27,191 --> 01:41:32,233
Re-elect native son President PARK,

1302
01:41:32,650 --> 01:41:35,691
<i>the heir to Gyeongsang's old glory!</i>

1303
01:41:35,692 --> 01:41:37,400
<i>Stoke Gyeongsang's sense of superiority</i>

1304
01:41:37,733 --> 01:41:40,900
If we don't elect a president
from Gyeongsang,

1305
01:41:41,900 --> 01:41:43,733
our region will become

1306
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:44,399
<i>Where are you taking those trees?</i>

1307
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:50,316
nothing more than a land of outcasts!

1308
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:46,149
<i>Shh! We're hiding them.</i>

1309
01:41:46,150 --> 01:41:49,025
<i>If Kim is elected, they'll
move all these trees to Jeolla.</i>

1310
01:41:59,608 --> 01:42:00,608
Sir.

1311
01:42:01,191 --> 01:42:04,941
Let's add more security for
the speech in Gyeongsang.

1312
01:42:05,108 --> 01:42:06,482
With the mood these days...

1313
01:42:06,483 --> 01:42:08,941
Yes, please do that.

1314
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:16,983
By any chance,

1315
01:42:17,650 --> 01:42:20,191
have you spoken with SEO recently?

1316
01:42:22,733 --> 01:42:25,690
I'd go see him. These
seem like his tactics...

1317
01:42:25,691 --> 01:42:28,108
Leave the security as it is.

1318
01:42:29,191 --> 01:42:31,233
Let's not make things more tense.

1319
01:42:35,275 --> 01:42:37,150
Put in an editorial

1320
01:42:37,483 --> 01:42:42,025
that a Jeolla president would
concentrate investment there.

1321
01:42:42,691 --> 01:42:45,149
We have one writer
with a really sharp pen.

1322
01:42:45,150 --> 01:42:50,066
<i>KIM Woon-bum, a Curse
on Gyeongsang's Economy</i>

1323
01:42:54,525 --> 01:42:56,982
<i>Jeolla Spirit</i>

1324
01:42:56,983 --> 01:42:58,649
<i>Boycott Goods from Jeolla</i>

1325
01:42:58,650 --> 01:43:00,107
<i>Boycott Goods from Jeolla</i>

1326
01:43:00,108 --> 01:43:01,940
<i>Did you hear the news, Mister CHOI?</i>

1327
01:43:01,941 --> 01:43:02,858
<i>What news?</i>

1328
01:43:02,859 --> 01:43:07,149
There's a rumor they'll build a
giant garbage dump in Jeolla.

1329
01:43:07,150 --> 01:43:09,524
What a smell!

1330
01:43:09,525 --> 01:43:12,399
Why build it here in Jeolla?

1331
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:15,108
Just hear me out!

1332
01:43:15,316 --> 01:43:18,107
So in the end they decided
to build it in Gyeongsang.

1333
01:43:18,108 --> 01:43:20,983
Why take it away from us?

1334
01:43:21,233 --> 01:43:23,858
Those damned Gyeongsang thieves!

1335
01:43:28,025 --> 01:43:32,608
Wow, our nation's people are furious.

1336
01:43:33,775 --> 01:43:38,525
But if they found out we did
it, there could be a backlash.

1337
01:43:39,316 --> 01:43:43,274
A raging bull only sees the red flag.

1338
01:43:43,275 --> 01:43:46,400
It doesn't even think
about who's waving it.

1339
01:43:53,941 --> 01:43:58,608
These days there's a
saying in Gyeongsang.

1340
01:43:59,775 --> 01:44:03,691
Even the local fool votes local.

1341
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:11,566
The people are so creative.
They're better than us.

1342
01:44:14,525 --> 01:44:16,941
We've set the nation against itself,

1343
01:44:17,858 --> 01:44:20,608
and who knows when this rift will end.

1344
01:44:22,191 --> 01:44:24,566
Let's not clink glasses over it.

1345
01:44:25,525 --> 01:44:29,816
Our people were divided North
and South because of the war.

1346
01:44:30,233 --> 01:44:34,650
All we did is extend the
divide east and west.

1347
01:45:00,525 --> 01:45:01,608
What?

1348
01:45:03,108 --> 01:45:05,108
You're still awake?

1349
01:45:07,691 --> 01:45:12,733
Sleep a bit at least.
Tomorrow's a big day.

1350
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:17,650
What's wrong?

1351
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:21,066
Worried that you'll lose?

1352
01:45:24,316 --> 01:45:25,316
No.

1353
01:45:29,858 --> 01:45:31,233
We're going to win.

1354
01:46:01,525 --> 01:46:04,399
<i>A free vote, and a joyful election.</i>

1355
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:07,857
<i>In order to choose a true
president for the people,</i>

1356
01:46:07,858 --> 01:46:10,025
<i>the nation cast their votes.</i>

1357
01:46:10,691 --> 01:46:14,525
<i>In the most orderly election
in our 23-year history,</i>

1358
01:46:14,775 --> 01:46:16,440
<i>the people's choice...</i>

1359
01:46:16,441 --> 01:46:20,357
<i>and with 6,342,828 votes cast,</i>

1360
01:46:20,358 --> 01:46:25,816
<i>President PARK of the
Republicans won re-election.</i>

1361
01:46:28,066 --> 01:46:31,441
How much more are they going to pocket?

1362
01:46:33,358 --> 01:46:36,941
I really thought KIM
Woon-bum would win...

1363
01:46:38,150 --> 01:46:41,608
Everyone from Gyeongsang
voted for PARK!

1364
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:47,858
Even if entire Jeolla folks vote for KIM,
there was no way to win over PARK!

1365
01:47:06,775 --> 01:47:10,900
<i>Personally I feel quite composed.</i>

1366
01:47:12,025 --> 01:47:15,775
<i>But in this election,</i>

1367
01:47:16,316 --> 01:47:22,650
the people's wish for a peaceful
change in leadership was stifled.

1368
01:47:24,566 --> 01:47:28,066
With hopes extinguished
of bringing about

1369
01:47:28,483 --> 01:47:33,483
any future change of government
through the ballot box,

1370
01:47:35,233 --> 01:47:47,066
I cannot accept the results of
this unlawful, fraudulent vote.

1371
01:47:48,983 --> 01:47:53,066
Therefore I pledge before you now

1372
01:47:53,941 --> 01:47:56,483
to uphold my beliefs and responsibility

1373
01:47:57,108 --> 01:47:59,233
until my final days.

1374
01:48:03,983 --> 01:48:05,150
Thank you.

1375
01:48:30,816 --> 01:48:33,233
I added a bit more
to what was promised.

1376
01:48:37,025 --> 01:48:38,358
Did you vote?

1377
01:48:43,108 --> 01:48:44,525
I guess not.

1378
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:50,816
Oh my, I was really curious
who you'd vote for.

1379
01:48:54,275 --> 01:48:56,358
All my ideas about justice

1380
01:48:58,775 --> 01:49:01,066
were brought down by my own hand.

1381
01:49:01,775 --> 01:49:03,858
Do I really need to put a stamp on it?

1382
01:49:05,025 --> 01:49:06,150
Justice?

1383
01:49:09,733 --> 01:49:12,858
The work you did for
them was about justice?

1384
01:49:14,900 --> 01:49:19,150
You changed positions but the
work you did was the same.

1385
01:49:22,441 --> 01:49:26,400
Still, that side had a cause.

1386
01:49:29,608 --> 01:49:34,733
So romantic, all this talk
of justice and causes.

1387
01:49:35,441 --> 01:49:37,566
You should be a politician!

1388
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:42,608
But who says only one side has a cause?

1389
01:49:50,025 --> 01:49:53,649
Just as you believed in KIM,
I believe in our President.

1390
01:49:53,650 --> 01:49:55,275
That is my justice.

1391
01:49:56,233 --> 01:49:58,733
Doesn't the word justice
usually belong to the victor?

1392
01:50:00,900 --> 01:50:03,483
So a successful coup
is called a revolution.

1393
01:50:05,733 --> 01:50:08,775
We won, so...

1394
01:50:10,608 --> 01:50:12,941
what we achieved is justice.

1395
01:50:19,108 --> 01:50:24,400
We should hurry. The
President is waiting.

1396
01:50:32,150 --> 01:50:38,108
Do you really think I
could be a politician?

1397
01:50:40,358 --> 01:50:42,608
You're more than qualified.

1398
01:50:51,358 --> 01:50:56,150
My work is done, so I'll take this.

1399
01:50:57,525 --> 01:51:00,941
Wait, aren't you going
to meet the President?

1400
01:51:01,233 --> 01:51:03,316
If not, you won't get a seat!

1401
01:51:07,941 --> 01:51:08,941
But...

1402
01:51:15,525 --> 01:51:19,108
What a shame. I thought
we'd work more together.

1403
01:51:19,483 --> 01:51:21,108
Let me ask one thing.

1404
01:51:22,691 --> 01:51:25,566
When you set off the
explosion in KIM's house,

1405
01:51:27,316 --> 01:51:31,066
was my joining you
part of the broader plan?

1406
01:51:36,733 --> 01:51:38,691
We didn't set that off.

1407
01:51:40,900 --> 01:51:42,566
It wasn't you?

1408
01:51:52,900 --> 01:51:54,441
Let's say it was.

1409
01:53:15,483 --> 01:53:19,066
<i>17 Years Later, Seoul 1988</i>

1410
01:53:41,233 --> 01:53:43,233
This place looks the same, right?

1411
01:54:06,275 --> 01:54:09,566
Have you been well?

1412
01:54:12,441 --> 01:54:13,525
Yes.

1413
01:54:14,191 --> 01:54:18,108
I just live a quiet life.

1414
01:54:21,775 --> 01:54:24,191
I heard about you on the news.

1415
01:54:26,025 --> 01:54:27,775
About being kidnapped.

1416
01:54:28,316 --> 01:54:29,983
Your time in prison.

1417
01:54:31,608 --> 01:54:33,691
Being sentenced to death.

1418
01:54:35,733 --> 01:54:38,025
And losing the election
again last year.

1419
01:54:42,691 --> 01:54:47,566
Before the election, some
people came to see me.

1420
01:54:49,358 --> 01:54:53,066
The man who is now president
asked for my help.

1421
01:54:54,816 --> 01:54:56,358
Go on back.

1422
01:54:57,400 --> 01:54:59,775
You guys will win anyway.

1423
01:55:01,358 --> 01:55:05,358
KIM Woon-bum and KIM Young-ho
are going to split the vote,

1424
01:55:06,233 --> 01:55:08,316
so you don't need my help.

1425
01:55:10,816 --> 01:55:12,900
I should have yielded to him.

1426
01:55:14,608 --> 01:55:17,066
I'll always regret that.

1427
01:55:23,941 --> 01:55:26,066
Sometimes I think,

1428
01:55:26,983 --> 01:55:31,108
how nice it would be if
we could turn back time.

1429
01:55:38,150 --> 01:55:39,900
But that's not possible.

1430
01:55:55,066 --> 01:55:57,400
When I was young I raised chickens.

1431
01:55:59,066 --> 01:56:01,650
But one day they stopped laying.

1432
01:56:03,033 --> 01:56:07,366
Then I saw that my
neighbor was stealing eggs.

1433
01:56:09,033 --> 01:56:11,575
So I told the village foreman,

1434
01:56:12,783 --> 01:56:17,325
but the neighbor was his relative
and he wasn't punished.

1435
01:56:19,866 --> 01:56:23,408
What would you do in that situation?

1436
01:56:29,658 --> 01:56:33,783
I'd give him the next
day's eggs as a present.

1437
01:56:36,616 --> 01:56:39,700
Tell him sorry for suspecting him.

1438
01:56:40,700 --> 01:56:44,991
If he had any conscience,
he'd reconsider.

1439
01:56:53,950 --> 01:56:56,325
What if he had no conscience?

1440
01:56:59,450 --> 01:57:01,950
That's a hard one.

1441
01:57:08,075 --> 01:57:14,866
I guess I'd find you and ask for help.

1442
01:57:22,158 --> 01:57:27,658
I'd probably propose
a method you don't like.

1443
01:57:34,116 --> 01:57:38,075
Hell, I know that.

1444
01:58:16,408 --> 01:58:18,158
<i>My dear respected citizens.</i>

1445
01:58:18,159 --> 01:58:21,074
<i>The 1997 election
marked the first time</i>

1446
01:58:21,075 --> 01:58:23,596
<i>For the first time in our history,</i>

1447
01:58:23,597 --> 01:58:26,908
<i>that opposition candidate
defeated the ruling party.</i>

1448
01:58:26,909 --> 01:58:31,740
<i>I celebrate with you the election
of an opposition candidate,</i>

1449
01:58:31,741 --> 01:58:35,679
<i>SEO Chang-dae was
not present to witness it.</i>

1450
01:58:35,680 --> 01:58:37,366
<i>having overcome
many trials and hurdles.</i>

1451
01:58:37,575 --> 01:58:41,532
<i>To you who have
birthed a new government,</i>

1452
01:58:41,533 --> 01:58:43,596
<i>I give my undying thanks and praise...</i>
