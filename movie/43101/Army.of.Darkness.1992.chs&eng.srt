21
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:10,605

什麼？那個傻子？
What? That buffoon?

36
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:44,686
他...

50
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:57,288
亞瑟王！亞瑟王來到！
Lord Arthur! Lord Arthur approaches!

51
00:06:47,477 --> 00:06:51,692
亞瑟王，我兄弟呢？沒跟您一起嗎？
Lord Arthur, where is my brother?
Did he not ride with you?

52
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:53,898
啊，驍勇善戰

除去他的項圈！
Get that yoke off him!

66
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:12,334
你不是我的奴隸
You, sir, are not one of my vassals.

67
00:08:14,147 --> 00:08:15,551
你是誰？
Who are you?

68
00:08:16,491 --> 00:08:18,158
誰在問？
Who wants to know?

69
00:08:19,305 --> 00:08:22,549
我是紅衣亨利，薛爾公爵

70
00:08:22,924 --> 00:08:25,836

Lord of the Northlands
and leader of its peoples.

71

跟你說吧，老兄
Well, hello, Mister Fancy Pants.
I got news for you, pal.

72
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,472
現在你只領導兩樣事情
狗跟屎
You ain't leading but two things right now,
jack and shit.

73
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,522
-這堥S狗
-閉上鳥嘴！
. And Jack left town.

74
00:08:37,865 --> 00:08:40,674
紳士們，亞瑟王！
Gentlemen, Lord Arthur!

75
00:08:49,256 --> 00:08:51,928
惡魔已蘇醒了
There is an evil awakened in this land.

76
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:56,652
我的手下拼命抵抗...
And while my people fight
for their very souls against it...

77
00:08:56,861 --> 00:08:59,602
...你，紅衣亨利，向我們宣戰
...you, Henry the Red, wage war on us.

78
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,382

是你先攻擊我們的
It was you who first turned
your swords on us.

80
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:09,782
這個惡魔也已敗壞了我的手下！
And this evil has befouled
my people as well!

81
00:09:09,861 --> 00:09:13,001
你的手下也不見得比那深坑堛...
Your people are no better
than the foul corruption...

82
00:09:13,076 --> 00:09:15,279
惡魔好多少...
...that lies in the bowels of that pit!

83
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,327
對！你也好不了多少！
Right! You're no better!

84
00:09:17,532 --> 00:09:20,033
願神憐憫你的靈魂
May God have mercy upon your souls.

85
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,398
天啊！是什麼東西？
In God's name!
What hell. Spawned thing lurks there?

86
00:09:43,931 --> 00:09:47,540
把他丟進深坑去跟嗜血雜種作伴
Into the pit
with those bloodthirsty sons of whores.

87
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:49,215
走！
Move!

88
00:09:49,895 --> 00:09:50,888
不！
No!

89
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:24,761
天！天啊！
God! Heavenly God!

90
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,286
他逃走了！
He's escaping!

91
00:10:31,705 --> 00:10:33,201
抓住他！
Hold him!

92
00:11:07,586 --> 00:11:10,087
他們看起來沒那麼精明了吧？
They don't look so clever now, do they?

93
00:11:10,165 --> 00:11:11,832
他嚇壞了！
He's frightened!

94
00:11:14,856 --> 00:11:18,236
喂，喂！等等
Whoa, whoa! Wait a minute.

95
00:11:19,647 --> 00:11:21,816
等等，等一下！
Hold it. Wait a minute!

96
00:11:21,992 --> 00:11:24,059
你得了解，老兄
You gotta understand, man.

97
00:11:24,705 --> 00:11:27,617
我之前從沒見過這些混球！
I never even saw these assholes before!

98
00:11:28,558 --> 00:11:29,928
他嚇壞了！
He trembles!

99
00:11:31,842 --> 00:11:33,578
你在等什麼？
What are you waiting for?

100
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:36,360
亨利，你得告訴他們，你不認識我
Henry, you gotta tell them
you don't know me.

101
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:38,975
我們素未謀面，說啊！
We never met, tell them!

102
00:11:41,691 --> 00:11:44,100
他不會聽的，小兄弟
I do not think he'll listen, lad.

103
00:11:46,013 --> 00:11:50,228
聽清楚，你們抓錯人了
Look, I'm telling you.
You've got the wrong guy.

104
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:03,791
跟你說你們抓錯人了
I'm telling you, you got the wrong guy.

105
00:13:20,253 --> 00:13:21,520
啊，你...
Why, you...

106
00:13:26,787 --> 00:13:31,435
-鐵釘
-他說鐵釘！上鐵釘！
. Spikes.
. Hey, he said spikes! Give him spikes!

107
00:13:45,715 --> 00:13:48,490
讓開！陌生人！
Make way! Strange one!

108
00:14:00,456 --> 00:14:01,484
陌生人！
Strange one!

109
00:14:26,788 --> 00:14:29,197
詛咒你
Damn you.

110
00:15:54,295 --> 00:15:56,738
你的鞋帶松了
You know, your shoelace is untied.

111
00:16:07,697 --> 00:16:09,033
好
All right.

112
00:16:10,812 --> 00:16:12,342
誰來挑戰？
Who wants some?

113
00:16:13,324 --> 00:16:14,957
該誰來？
Who's next?

誰來？誰要來挑戰？
Who wants some?
Who wants to have a little?

116
00:16:28,535 --> 00:16:29,528
你
You.

117
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,260
你要打嗎？
You want some more?

118
00:16:39,858 --> 00:16:41,330
要嗎？
You want a little?

119
00:16:44,012 --> 00:16:46,650
你？要不要打？
Do you? You want some more?

120
00:17:03,745 --> 00:17:06,315
快滾
Now, get on those horses
and get out of here.

121
00:17:09,943 --> 00:17:11,347
放他們走！
Let them go!

122
00:17:34,868 --> 00:17:35,861
停！
Halt!

拿劍的人！

125
00:17:50,647 --> 00:17:54,358
驕傲的人，我要將你殺死
For that arrogance, I shall see you dead.

126
00:18:00,933 --> 00:18:02,165
巫術！
Sorcery!

127
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,016
好
Yeah.

128
00:18:07,063 --> 00:18:10,135
你們這些未開化的白癡們，聽好了
All right, you primitive screwheads,
listen up.

129

cobalt. Blue steel, and a hair trigger.

136
00:18:38,723 --> 00:18:43,543
對啦，絕對物超所值
That's right. Shop smart. Shop S. Mart.

137
00:18:44,284 --> 00:18:45,882
懂了嗎？
You got that?

138
00:18:46,897 --> 00:18:48,667
我發誓...
Now, I swear...

139
00:18:49,611 --> 00:18:51,986
...你們誰要是敢...
...the next one of you primates...

140
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,829
...再碰我一下...
...even touches me...

141
00:19:24,386 --> 00:19:28,932
來談談我該怎麼回去吧
Now, let's talk about how I get back home.

142
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:02,642
我懇求您的寬恕，陛下
I prithee to forgive me, my Lord.

143
00:20:03,047 --> 00:20:05,548
我以為您是亨利的同黨
I believed thee one of Henry's men.

144
00:20:05,895 --> 00:20:08,967
一開始你要殺我，現在你要吻我
First you wanna kill me,
now you wanna kiss me.

145
00:20:10,652 --> 00:20:11,714
滾
Blow.

146
00:20:15,979 --> 00:20:18,823
怎麼樣？能不能送我回去？
So what's the deal?
Can you send me back or not?

147
00:20:18,894 --> 00:20:23,406
只有死亡志記才有能力
我們也在找這本邪惡的書
Only the Necronomicon has the power,
an unholy book which we also require.

148
00:20:23,684 --> 00:20:27,567
書中記載著如何讓你回到自己的時空
Within its pages are passages
that can send you back to your time.

149
00:20:27,772 --> 00:20:30,444
只有你，上天的使者，才能拿到它
Only you, the promised one,
can quest for it.

150
00:20:31,725 --> 00:20:34,763
我不要你的書，也不聽你廢話
I don't want your book.
I don't want your bullshit!

151
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,220
趕快把我送回我的時空
快！快！快...
Just send me back to my own time.
Pronto! Today! Chop...

152
00:20:48,509 --> 00:20:51,387
你該死
You shall die!

153
00:20:56,885 --> 00:21:00,129
你絕不可以拿死亡志記
You shall never take the Necronomicon.

154
00:21:00,838 --> 00:21:04,687
我們將飽餐你的靈魂
We shall feast upon your souls!

155
00:21:28,108 --> 00:21:30,449
那是魔法，拿斧頭來
It's a trick. Get an ax.

156
00:21:37,992 --> 00:21:39,899
守衛！殺死他！
Guards! Kill her!

157
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:43,683
抓住巫婆！抓住她！
Capture the witch! Capture the witch!

158
00:21:44,457 --> 00:21:47,529
我的眼睛！我瞎了！天，我瞎了！
My eyes! I'm blind! Oh, God, I'm blind!

159
00:21:49,617 --> 00:21:50,610
不！
No!

160
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:57,621
喂，妖女！
Yo, she. Bitch!

161
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,667
來啊
Let's go.

162
00:22:23,353 --> 00:22:26,162
如果死亡志記落在邪惡人手中...
If the Necronomicon fell into
the hands of the Deadites...

163
00:22:26,268 --> 00:22:28,838
...所有人類都會被惡魔消滅
...all mankind will be consumed
by this evil.

164
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:31,357
現在你願意去取書了嗎？
Now will thou quest for the book?

165
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:46,531
那個
That one.

166
00:23:13,774 --> 00:23:15,178
太棒了
Groovy.

167
00:23:28,715 --> 00:23:31,753
怎麼？你在農場長大的啊？
關上門
What's the matter, you raised in a barn?
Shut the door.

168
00:23:32,133 --> 00:23:35,273
大概是跟這些原始人一樣
都在農場長大的
Probably was raised in a barn,
with all the other primitives.

169
00:23:44,462 --> 00:23:47,534
智者說你是上天派遣來的
The Wisemen say that thou art
the promised one.

170
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:54,309
據說你要去取書來幫助我們
'Tis said thou wilt journey for the book
to help us.

171
00:23:54,378 --> 00:23:57,084
你會帶領我們抵抗邪魔
And that thou wilt lead our people
against the evil.

172
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:00,437
我唯一目的只是要回家
The only reason I'm going to get the book
is to get home.

173
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,913
聽說你會一早出發
I believe thou wilt be leaving
in the morning.

174
00:24:08,985 --> 00:24:10,481
別碰，拜托
Don't touch that, please!

175
00:24:10,593 --> 00:24:14,374
你未開發的智慧無法理解
合成金屬成分...
Your primitive intellect wouldn't
understand alloys and compositions...

176
00:24:14,446 --> 00:24:17,621
...還有原子單位結構...
...and things with molecular structures
and the...

177
00:24:20,275 --> 00:24:22,182
你來這媟F嘛？
What are you doing here, anyway?

178
00:24:23,223 --> 00:24:27,472
我要跟你說我會為你禱告祈福...
I wanted to say that all of my hopes
and prayers go with thee...

179
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,915
...我幫你做了這個
...and I made this for thee.

180
00:24:30,962 --> 00:24:33,463
好，我正需要馬墊
Good. I could use a horse blanket.

181
00:24:55,921 --> 00:24:57,828
給我一個吻，寶貝
Give me some sugar, baby.

182
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:04,957
來，兄弟們！
Come on, boys!

183
00:26:26,444 --> 00:26:27,848
穩住
Steady, now.

184
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:38,034
-什麼？什麼東西？
-這道路將引你到邪惡地點
. What? What is it?
. This path will lead you to an unholy place.

185
00:26:38,571 --> 00:26:42,214
一個墓園，死亡志記就在那
A cemetery.
There the Necronomicon awaits.

186
00:26:46,042 --> 00:26:49,617
當你拿起書時，你一定要說：
When thou retrievest the book from
its cradle, you must recite the words:

187
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:52,567
「卡拉吐，    巴拉他，尼克吐」
"Klaatu, barada, nikto."

188
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:57,596
-卡拉吐，    巴拉他，尼克吐，好
-再念一次
. Klaatu, barada, nikto. Okay.
. Well, repeat them.

189
00:26:59,007 --> 00:27:02,216
-卡拉吐，    巴拉他，尼克吐
-再一次
. Klaatu, barada, nikto.
. Again!

190
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:05,636
知道了！知道了！
我會念的，好了吧？
I got it! I got it!
I know your damn words, all right?

191
00:27:06,243 --> 00:27:08,378
你們兩個聽清楚
Now, you get this straight,
the both of you!

192
00:27:08,454 --> 00:27:11,058
如果我拿到書，你們就送我回去
If I get that book, you send me back.

193
00:27:11,637 --> 00:27:13,772
然後，我就走了
After that, I'm history.

194
00:28:17,837 --> 00:28:19,435
怎麼了？
What is it, boy?

195
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,033
來！
Come on!

196
00:32:33,825 --> 00:32:35,697
快跑！
Ramming speed!

197
00:32:44,077 --> 00:32:45,847
預備，瞄准，開火！
Ready. Aim. Fire!

198
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,104
快點！
Shake a leg!

199
00:33:09,304 --> 00:33:11,074
你這小...
You lousy little...

200
00:33:19,656 --> 00:33:23,070
我會一個一個把你們都...
Yeah! I'm gonna hunt down all you...

201
00:33:40,193 --> 00:33:42,500
小渾蛋們！好！
You little bastards! All right!

202
00:33:42,772 --> 00:33:46,781
我會一個一個壓扁你們
壓得扁扁的，你等著吧！
I'll crush each and every one of you.
I'll crush you to pieces, I'm telling you!

203
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:50,138
我會把你打得...
I'll squash you so hard,
you'll have to look up to see...

204
00:33:50,209 --> 00:33:51,681
嘿，傻蛋！
Hey, dumb ass!

205
00:33:55,738 --> 00:33:57,074
大好機會！
Surf's up!

206
00:34:08,234 --> 00:34:09,764
一起來！
All together now!

207
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:28,694
狗屎！
Shit!

208
00:34:39,759 --> 00:34:42,100
小聲，慢慢來
Quietly. Gently.

209
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,446
慢點，傻大個，慢點
Easy, big fella. Easy.

210
00:35:05,656 --> 00:35:08,831
「倫敦鐵橋垮下來」
"London Bridge is falling down

211
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:13,827
「垮下來，垮下來」
"Falling down, falling down"

212
00:35:15,807 --> 00:35:17,748
「美麗小姐」
"My fair lady"

213
00:35:29,509 --> 00:35:31,142
他起得來嗎？
Is he up? Is he?

214
00:35:38,221 --> 00:35:40,859
真是一場惡夢
What a horrible nightmare.

215
00:35:42,543 --> 00:35:43,981
等等
Wait a minute.

216
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:46,184
噢，天！
Oh, God!

217
00:35:46,999 --> 00:35:48,871
我不能動！
I can't move!

218
00:36:01,706 --> 00:36:03,110
張開嘴！
Open wide!

219
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,587
走！
Let's go!

220
00:36:07,134 --> 00:36:10,138
萬歲！
Geronimo!

221
00:36:16,213 --> 00:36:17,480
走！
Let's go!

222
00:36:40,736 --> 00:36:45,122
好，小家夥，來點熱巧克力吧？
Okay, little fella.
How about some hot chocolate?

223
00:36:55,812 --> 00:37:00,027
嘗到厲害了吧？知道了吧...
How'd you like the taste of that?
How'd you like the taste...

224
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:20,494
天啊！越來越大！
Dear God! It's growing bigger!

225
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,748
-嘿
-嘿
. Hey!
. Hey!

226
00:37:44,826 --> 00:37:47,201
-這是怎麼--
-這是怎麼--
. What's the big idea<i>...</i>
. What's the big idea<i>...</i>

227
00:37:47,272 --> 00:37:48,802
-嘿，你-
-嘿，你-
. Why, you<i>...</i>
. Why, you<i>...</i>

228
00:37:53,503 --> 00:37:55,307
我瞎了，我瞎了
I'm blind. I'm blind.

229
00:38:05,898 --> 00:38:07,805
你帶我去哪？
Where are you taking me?

230
00:38:08,143 --> 00:38:11,889
「噢，蘇珊娜，請別為我哭泣」
"Oh, Susanna, don't you cry for me

231
00:38:11,962 --> 00:38:16,279
「我來自阿拉巴馬帶著斑鳩遊四方」
"'Cause I come from Alabama
with a banjo on my knee"

232
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:31,491
你是什麼東西？
What are you?

233
00:38:32,197 --> 00:38:33,533
你是我？
Are you me?

234
00:38:33,738 --> 00:38:35,805
「你是什麼？你是我？」
"What are you? Are you me?"

235
00:38:37,826 --> 00:38:40,396
-你聽起來像個混蛋！
-你為什麼這樣？
. You sound like a jerk!
. Why are you doing this?

236
00:38:40,505 --> 00:38:43,714
你想知道？因為答案很簡單
You want to know?
Because the answer's easy.

237
00:38:44,325 --> 00:38:47,900
我是壞阿希，你是好阿希
I'm bad Ash. And you're good Ash.

238
00:38:48,144 --> 00:38:51,650
你是個乖寶寶
你是個乖寶寶
You're goody little two. Shoes.
You're goody little two. Shoes.

239
00:39:21,277 --> 00:39:22,944
我沒那麼乖
I ain't that good.

240
00:40:28,457 --> 00:40:30,432
現在你知道我厲害了
Now you see what's what.

241
00:40:31,976 --> 00:40:34,820
這身體可是我的
A man's body is his own personal property.

242
00:40:36,297 --> 00:40:39,506
沒人能將之奪走
Don't let anybody try
and take that away from him.

243
00:40:41,222 --> 00:40:45,071
給你個教訓
That'll teach you. Yeah. That'll teach you.

244
00:40:47,621 --> 00:40:50,293
你不可能拿到死亡志記
You shall never retrieve the Necronomicon.

245
00:40:50,435 --> 00:40:53,439
拿到書前你就會死在墓園
You'll die in the graveyard
before you get it.

246
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:57,229
嘿，你臉上有什麼東西？
Hey, what's that you got on your face?

247
00:41:00,183 --> 00:41:03,187
-懂了吧？
-我會回來算帳的
. See how that works?
. I'll come back for you.

248
00:41:22,462 --> 00:41:23,934
來！
Come on, boy!

249
00:41:38,912 --> 00:41:40,076
來！
Come on!

250
00:42:58,714 --> 00:42:59,810
三本？
Three books?

251
00:43:04,442 --> 00:43:06,543
等等，等等
Wait a minute. Hold it.

252
00:43:06,988 --> 00:43:10,334
沒人說過會有三本書
Nobody said anything about three books.

253
00:43:11,176 --> 00:43:12,946
那個臭智者！
That stinking Wiseman!

254
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,860
光顧著要我講密語...
He was so busy filling me
with his secret words...

255
00:43:15,934 --> 00:43:20,217
...跟一大堆屁話
他可沒提到會有三本書
...and his phrases, and his bullshit,
that he never said anything about this.

256
00:43:21,964 --> 00:43:26,886
我該怎麼辦？
拿一本，三本還是怎樣？
Like what am I supposed to do?
Take one book, or all books, or what?

257
00:44:32,887 --> 00:44:34,223
不是這本
Wrong book.

258
00:45:27,797 --> 00:45:29,327
滾！
Get outta here!

259
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:41,623
我回頭再來找你
I'll get back to you.

260
00:45:43,476 --> 00:45:44,708
呃...
Well...

261
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:48,626
...很明顯了
...it seems fairly obvious.

262
00:45:53,191 --> 00:45:56,195
等等，密語，對了
Wait a minute. The words. Right.

263
00:45:57,279 --> 00:45:59,151
說密語
Say the words.

264
00:46:02,706 --> 00:46:03,973
卡拉吐...
Klaatu...

265
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:06,154
...巴拉他...
...barada...

266
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:15,627
尼克泰
Necktie.

267
00:46:16,207 --> 00:46:17,303
尼克塔
Nectar.

268
00:46:17,782 --> 00:46:18,946
尼克爾
Nickel.

269
00:46:19,792 --> 00:46:24,041
奴斗爾，是「N」開頭的沒錯
確定是「N」開頭的
Noodle. It's an "N" word.
It's definitely an "N" word.

270
00:46:27,665 --> 00:46:29,537
確定是「N」開頭的
Definitely an "N" word!

271
00:46:41,334 --> 00:46:44,109
卡拉吐，    巴拉他...
Klaatu, barada...

272
00:47:00,262 --> 00:47:01,564
好囉
Okay, then.

273
00:47:11,507 --> 00:47:14,145
嘿！等等
Hey! Wait a minute.

274
00:47:14,689 --> 00:47:18,470
別找麻煩，我說密語了，我說了！
Everything's cool. I said the word. I did!

275
00:47:20,786 --> 00:47:22,282
不！等等！
No! Wait!

276
00:47:27,923 --> 00:47:28,951
不！
No!

277
00:47:37,035 --> 00:47:40,244
你們大家快找庇護！
You, people, seek cover! To the parapet!

278
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,194
把小孩找齊
Seek your children.

279
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:46,776
穩住馬匹！
Steady the horses!

280
00:47:47,387 --> 00:47:49,991
出事了，出事了
Something's wrong. Something's amiss.

281
00:48:23,468 --> 00:48:24,998
你上哪去？
Where'd you go?

282
00:49:00,991 --> 00:49:04,303
我會打扁你們！
打得你們稀巴爛，臭骨頭！
I'll crush you!
I'll mash your faces, you bony creatures!

283
00:49:13,655 --> 00:49:17,196
別把你的肮髒骨頭伸到我嘴
Keep your damn, filthy bones
out of my mouth.

284
00:49:34,895 --> 00:49:36,093
來！
Come on!

285
00:49:41,897 --> 00:49:46,854
我不當清道夫了
我達成承諾，現在我要回去了
I'm through being their garbage boy.
I did my part. Now I want back.

286
00:49:47,123 --> 00:49:48,756
一切按照約定行事
Like in the deal.

287
00:50:03,204 --> 00:50:05,008
我...
I...

288
00:50:05,214 --> 00:50:06,881
...重...
...live...

289
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:10,873
...生！
...again!

290
00:50:20,558 --> 00:50:24,509
那邊！上天使者！
上天使者回來了！
There! The promised one!
The promised one's returned!

291
00:50:24,914 --> 00:50:27,083
拉開鐵門！
Raise the portcullis!

292
00:50:39,922 --> 00:50:44,468
他真是上天的使者！
他帶回死亡志記了
Truly, he is the promised one!
He's brought the Necronomicon.

293
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:46,520
-嗨
-他拿到書了
. Hi.
. He's got the book!

294
00:50:46,589 --> 00:50:47,993
是，對
Yeah, great.

295
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:50,968
滾遠一點
Get the fuck out of my face.

296
00:50:57,142 --> 00:51:00,957
死亡志記，快
拿到死亡志記了嗎？
The Necronomicon, quickly.
Did you bring the Necronomicon?

297
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,638
-有，但是-
-但是什麼？
. Yeah, it's just that<i>...</i>
. Just what?

298
00:51:06,087 --> 00:51:08,462
沒事，拿去
Nothing. Here.

299
00:51:15,132 --> 00:51:17,667
送我回去吧，我們說好的
Now send me back. Like in the deal.

300
00:51:18,147 --> 00:51:22,727
當你拿起書時，你念了密語嗎？
When you removed the Necronomicon
from the cradle, did you speak the words?

301
00:51:23,072 --> 00:51:26,144
-嗯，大致上有
-你念的密語無誤嗎？
. Yeah, basically.
. Did you speak the exact words?

302
00:51:26,222 --> 00:51:29,203
也許我沒有一個字一個字的發音...
Look, maybe I didn't say every single,
little tiny syllable...

303
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:32,079
-但大致上，我念了密語
-你這可恨的傻子！
...but basically, I said 'em.
. Dung. eating fool!

304
00:51:32,152 --> 00:51:34,093
你害慘我們了
Thou hast doomed us all.

305
00:51:34,228 --> 00:51:37,803
只為你念錯密語
死亡軍團因此蘇醒了
When thou misspoke the words,
the army of the dead awoke.

306
00:51:37,947 --> 00:51:40,116
喂，慢著，菠菜下巴
Now, whoa, right there, spinach. Chin.

307
00:51:40,326 --> 00:51:43,272
你說只要拿到書就能料理一切
You said you could clean this mess up
once you got that book.

308
00:51:43,341 --> 00:51:47,350
還說書埵閉q話能讓我重返我的時空
That there's a passage in there that could
get rid of this thing and send me back.

309
00:51:47,462 --> 00:51:50,637
沒錯，這本書還是有能力送你回去
It's true, the book still possesses
the power to send you back.

310
00:51:50,745 --> 00:51:55,062
但對我們來說，一切都完了！
邪惡死者會瘋狂搶奪死亡志記
But to us, it is useless! The evil has
a terrible hunger for the Necronomicon.

311
00:51:55,134 --> 00:51:57,543
他們會找來這堙I
And it will come here to get it!

312
00:51:58,350 --> 00:51:59,788
我們說好的
We had a deal.

313
00:52:00,427 --> 00:52:03,202
你要這本書，我幫你拿來了！
You wanted the damn book,
I got it for you!

314
00:52:03,275 --> 00:52:05,478
我盡了本份，你該送我回去！
I did my part, now you send me back!

315
00:52:05,553 --> 00:52:06,751
好
Very well.

316
00:52:06,961 --> 00:52:11,141
我們言而有信
會依照協定行事
As we are men of our word,
we shall honor our bargain.

317
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:15,324
智者會將你送回你的時空
The Wiseman shall return you
to your own time.

318
00:52:16,207 --> 00:52:17,303
噢？
Yeah?

319
00:52:18,753 --> 00:52:20,191
我以為他是上天使者
I thought he was the one.

320
00:52:20,293 --> 00:52:23,765
對，因為我們說好了
Yeah, right, because that was the deal.

321
00:52:24,147 --> 00:52:28,601
我們什麼時候可以...
So when do you think we can start
with all the thing and the...

322
00:52:28,669 --> 00:52:30,610
他是個叛徒，叛徒！
He's nothing but a traitor, he is!

323
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:35,767
我們什麼時候可以開始...
When do you think we can start
with all the ceremony and the...

324
00:52:36,576 --> 00:52:39,785
...你知道的，我是想，因為...
...you know, like, you know, because...

325
00:52:40,361 --> 00:52:43,170
...打鐵趁熱嘛，對吧？
...sooner's always better than later, right?

326
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:48,831
-你真是男人的恥辱
-智者真是傻瓜才相信了你
. Wretched excuse for a man.
. The Wisemen were fools to trust in you.

327
00:52:50,345 --> 00:52:54,194
-我知道他不值得信任
-我還真信任過他
. I knew he couldn't be trusted.
. I trusted him.

328
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:58,310
我依然相信你能幫助我們
I still believe that thou wilt help us.

329
00:52:58,486 --> 00:53:01,935
席拉，你還不懂？結束了
Sheila. Don't you get it? It's over.

330
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:05,780
我沒有那個能力
I didn't have what it took.

331
00:53:08,067 --> 00:53:09,299
再見
So long.

332
00:53:14,701 --> 00:53:16,197
你會離開我？
You would leave me?

333
00:53:16,711 --> 00:53:19,452
天，我不屬於這
Cripes, I don't belong here.

334
00:53:20,899 --> 00:53:23,274
我有回去的機會，我不會放過
I got a chance to go back, and I'm taking it.

335
00:53:23,445 --> 00:53:25,684
但我們共享的一段呢？
But what of the things that we've shared?

336
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:29,239
你私下對我說的甜言蜜語呢？
What of all the sweet words
that you spoke in private?

337
00:53:31,284 --> 00:53:35,235
那只是所謂的枕邊細語，寶貝
沒什麼大意義的
Well, that's just what we call pillow talk,
baby. That's all.

338
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,512
不僅是這樣！
It was more than that!

339
00:53:39,392 --> 00:53:41,493
我仍相信你
I still have faith in thee.

340
00:53:42,139 --> 00:53:45,383
我仍相信你會留下來幫我們
I still believe that thou wilt stay
and save us.

341
00:53:51,117 --> 00:53:52,110
懦夫
Coward.

342
00:54:15,708 --> 00:54:18,689
-救我！
-席拉！
. Help me!
. Sheila!

343
00:54:32,492 --> 00:54:34,970
別放箭！你會傷了她
Hold your arms! You'll hit the girl.

344
00:54:40,098 --> 00:54:41,365
拿劍來
My sword.

345
00:54:46,463 --> 00:54:47,730
可惡！
Damn you!

346
00:55:06,564 --> 00:55:08,036
挖，用力挖！
Dig, damn you!

347
00:55:09,345 --> 00:55:11,183
挖快點！
Dig faster!

348
00:55:11,455 --> 00:55:15,201
我將統領所有在戰斗中死去
滿身爬滿螻蟻的鬼東西
I shall command every worm. Infested
son of a bitch that ever died in battle.

349
00:55:15,275 --> 00:55:16,839
-謝謝您
-你！
. Thank you, sir.
. You there!

350
00:55:16,916 --> 00:55:18,549
很好！
Handsomely, now!

351
00:55:18,659 --> 00:55:21,468
我們去攻擊他們的城堡
拿回我的書
We shall storm their castle
and get my book.

352
00:55:21,874 --> 00:55:23,873
起來，你們這些惡棍
Hoist, you damnable varlets!

353
00:55:28,775 --> 00:55:32,019
歡迎回到活人的地盤
Welcome back to the land of the living.

354
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:35,333
拿起鏟子來快挖！
Now pick up a shovel and get digging!

355
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,221
把女人帶來！
Bring on the wench!

356
00:55:39,831 --> 00:55:41,361
下去！
Get down there!

357
00:55:51,255 --> 00:55:53,162
給我一個吻，寶貝
Give me some sugar, baby.

358
00:55:59,363 --> 00:56:03,144
你真是可愛啊？
Now ain't you the sweet little thing?

359
00:56:06,499 --> 00:56:09,377
別碰我，你這惡心的東西！
Don't touch me, you foul thing!

360
00:56:15,886 --> 00:56:19,095
來，乖
Come on. That's it.

361
00:56:33,072 --> 00:56:35,813
你要派上用場囉，快走！
We got plans for you, girly. Girl! Move!

362
00:56:37,628 --> 00:56:41,100
快拼命挖，快點！
Bust your bones, you dig up holes, dogs!
Get thee hence!

363
00:56:51,063 --> 00:56:52,799
有探子來報！
A scout approaches!

364
00:57:00,074 --> 00:57:01,570
牽著馬
Get his horse!

365
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:03,650
起來
Arise.

366
00:57:03,726 --> 00:57:07,541
陛下，死亡軍團在野地上聚集
正朝著城堡過來
My Lord, an army of the dead gather
in the wilderness and approach the castle.

367
00:57:07,612 --> 00:57:10,055
-多遠？
-才兩天的路程
. How far from here?
. But two days ride.

368
00:57:10,192 --> 00:57:13,938
-有翅膀的是前鋒
-也許我們該快逃
. These winged ones are only the first.
. Perhaps we should leave soon.

369
00:57:14,011 --> 00:57:16,649
-到山中可保安全
-是，我們快逃！
. We'll be safe in the mountains.
. Yes. We must flee!

370
00:57:16,758 --> 00:57:19,796
-書上已記載了，這是注定的
-他們會奪走我們的靈魂
. It is written. It's been foretold.
. They'll take our souls.

371
00:57:19,908 --> 00:57:21,883
-我怕！
-所有人的靈魂！
. I'm afraid!
. Every one of our souls!

372
00:57:21,951 --> 00:57:23,618
我不想死
I don't want to die.

373
00:57:24,598 --> 00:57:28,573
好啊！快逃啊！
That's it! Go ahead and run!

374
00:57:29,623 --> 00:57:33,300
逃回家去跟媽媽哭啊！我？
Run home and cry to mama! Me?

375
00:57:34,782 --> 00:57:36,552
我不願再逃了！
I'm through running!

376
00:57:38,702 --> 00:57:41,237
我說我們留下來跟他們拼命
I say we stay here and fight it out.

377
00:57:41,784 --> 00:57:45,930
未來的人都跟你一樣會說大話嗎？
Are all men from the future
loudmouth braggarts?

378
00:57:46,341 --> 00:57:49,219
不，只有我才這樣
No. Just me, baby.

379
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:50,895
只有我
Just me.

380
00:57:52,036 --> 00:57:55,508
我們如何在城堡牆邊抵抗死亡軍團？
How will we fight an army of the dead
at our castle walls?

381
00:57:55,888 --> 00:58:00,742
怎麼跟他們拼命？用說的嗎？
大部分的人都逃走了
How will you fight that? More words?
Most of our people have already fled.

382
00:58:00,981 --> 00:58:02,922
這堨u剩60個人
We are but 60 men.

383
00:58:04,131 --> 00:58:07,774
我們可以找紅衣亨利的人來幫忙
Then we'll get Henry the Red
and his men to fight with us.

384
00:58:10,395 --> 00:58:14,438
誰願意加入？
Now! Who's with me?

385
00:58:28,721 --> 00:58:30,525
我跟隨你
I'll stand by you.

386
00:58:32,774 --> 00:58:36,989
-我願意效力
-我會獻出勇氣！
. You can count on my steel.
. I'll offer up my courage!

387
00:58:37,331 --> 00:58:40,540
-我與你共進退！
-我站在你這邊！
. Me sword's by your side!
. I'm with you!

388
00:58:41,116 --> 00:58:43,149
我為你效力
I'll bend my bow to your will, sir.

389
00:58:47,549 --> 00:58:50,724
萬歲！萬歲！萬歲！
Hail! Hail! Hail!

390
00:59:07,616 --> 00:59:11,625
親愛的，跟大夥打個招呼
Well, my dear, say hello to the boys.

391
00:59:18,203 --> 00:59:20,681
很久沒見這麼美的人了
There's a sight for sore bones.

392
00:59:25,138 --> 00:59:29,856
我壞到骨頭堣F
I may be bad, but I feel good.

393
00:59:31,771 --> 00:59:34,409
-誰是統領？
-您，陛下
. Who rules?
. It is you, my lord.

394
00:59:34,519 --> 00:59:36,015
向城堡前進！
To the castle!

395
00:59:38,807 --> 00:59:40,645
-但大家都怕！
-太重了！夠了
. But the men are afraid!
. It's too heavy! Now, that's enough.

396
00:59:40,717 --> 00:59:42,886
別抱怨了！
Quit your bellyaching!

397
00:59:43,966 --> 00:59:48,146
我知道你們怕，我們都怕
I know you're scared. We're all scared.

398
00:59:49,662 --> 00:59:52,163
但這不表示我們怯懦
But that doesn't mean we're cowards.

399
00:59:52,844 --> 00:59:55,756
我們能打敗他們，一定能！
We can take these Deadites,
we can take them!

400
00:59:57,434 --> 00:59:58,838
運用科學
With science.

401
01:00:03,029 --> 01:00:04,901
快，快！
Hurry up, now!

406
01:01:02,964 --> 01:01:04,402
好，來，來
Okay, in, in.

407
01:01:13,617 --> 01:01:15,021
火藥

408
01:01:50,402 --> 01:01:53,943
來了！死亡軍團來了！
They're coming! The Deadites approach!

409
01:01:59,581 --> 01:02:03,030
快，你這些沒用的人！
他們就要到了！
Quickly now, you worthless fools!
They'll be on us anon!

410
01:02:03,167 --> 01:02:04,639
快！
Come on, guys!

411
01:02:08,929 --> 01:02:13,075
就要見真章了
你們最好別讓我失望
The moment of truth is almost here.
You men better not fail me now.

412
01:02:29,566 --> 01:02:31,769
他們聲勢如此浩大
There's so damned many of them.

413
01:02:45,279 --> 01:02:46,877
我需要多一點人手
I need more men.

414
01:03:30,036 --> 01:03:34,011
戰壘！堆起石頭！快！
Battle stations! Get those rocks up!

讓他們知道我們的厲害！
Ready the catapults!
By God, let's give them what for!

416
01:03:48,229 --> 01:03:49,325
停！

417
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:56,932

418
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:07,223
拿到死亡志記後...
Once I possess the Necronomicon...

419
01:05:08,466 --> 01:05:13,480
...我會統治一切，你就是我的皇後
...I shall rule, and you shall be my queen.

420
01:05:27,964 --> 01:05:30,910
陛下，我們已經兩面都布置好了
My lord, we are positioned on both fronts.

421
01:05:30,979 --> 01:05:34,359
好，他們把我的書放哪堙H
Fine. Where are they keeping my book?

422
01:05:34,731 --> 01:05:37,609
那堙A陛下
在第二層牆的吊橋後面
There, my lord.
Beyond the drawbridge in the second wall.

423
01:05:37,679 --> 01:05:39,712
那是最安全的地方
That would be the safest place.

424
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:44,508
沒有人能阻撓我取得死亡志記
I will not allow anything to keep me
from possessing that Necronomicon.

425
01:05:46,323 --> 01:05:50,572
現在，向城堡邁進

439
01:07:53,998 --> 01:07:56,910
對啦，寶貝！

440
01:08:04,183 --> 01:08:05,519

-快逃啊！

443
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:24,614
側面的第二突擊隊會成功的
The sortie on the second flank will stand.

444

445
01:08:27,701 --> 01:08:31,412
長官，南面有第二波的攻擊
Sire, there's a second division
approaching from the south.

446

沖進城門！
Ram the gates!

447
01:08:39,125 --> 01:08:40,461
彈弓手！

彈弓手！南面！

456
01:09:52,562 --> 01:09:53,898
再...

457
01:09:55,141 --> 01:09:57,140
再沖
Sally forth.

458
01:10:00,938 --> 01:10:03,245
快，你們這些沒用的東西！
Come on, you miserable wretches!

459
01:10:13,936 --> 01:10:15,032
前進！

01:10:39,732 --> 01:10:40,896
可惡！
Damn you!

463
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:46,758
一定很痛！
That's gotta hurt!

464
01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:48,540
混帳東西！
You cretins!

465
01:10:48,878 --> 01:10:50,076

South flank, to the western wall! Now!

470
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:15,303
紅衣亨利呢？早告訴你他不會來！
Where is Henry the Red?
I told you he would not come!

471
01:11:15,378 --> 01:11:20,198
戴好你的罐頭帽子，鐵頭！
我說他會來，他就是會來！
Keep your sardine can on, bucket. Head!
I said he'll be here, he'll be here!

472
01:11:20,605 --> 01:11:23,311
我不認為，但我要告訴你
I think he will not. But know this.

473
01:11:23,721 --> 01:11:28,575
無論戰役結果如何
認為你是懦夫是我的錯
No matter how this battle fares,
I was wrong to think you a coward.

474
01:11:34,374 --> 01:11:37,183
沖破了！城陷了！
We've broken through! The castle is ours!

好了！
All right, men!

01:12:21,344 --> 01:12:24,690
他們沖破了第一道牆！
接下來怎麼辦？
They've breached the first wall!
What next?

478
01:12:31,696 --> 01:12:34,139
我們被遺棄了！
We are deserted!

479
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:37,715
向後退！守衛城牆！
Fall back! Man the parapet!

480
01:12:38,128 --> 01:12:39,726
保護死亡志記！
Protect the book!

481
01:12:41,076 --> 01:12:42,640
願神救助
God save us all.

482
01:12:43,556 --> 01:12:47,439
爬上樓梯，小子！
到安全的牆後去！
Up the ladders, lads!
To the safety of the parapets!

483
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:59,767
與21世紀打個招呼

來！人人有份！

抓住車上的人！
It's the one in the cart we want. Get him!

487
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:52,493
再見啦，蠢蛋！
<i>Sayonara</i>, sucker!

488
01:13:59,137 --> 01:14:00,301
你...
Why, you...

489
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,798
你逃不出我的手掌心！
You can run, but you can't hide!

490
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:32,397
席拉？
Sheila?

491
01:14:57,799 --> 01:15:00,300
-我們已拿下庭院了，陛下
-很好
. We've secured the courtyard, my lord.
. Excellent.

492
01:15:01,183 --> 01:15:03,958
該是拿書的時候了，把牆撞破！
Now I will have that book.
Storm the walls!

493
01:15:04,432 --> 01:15:05,528
樓梯！
Ladders!

494
01:15:05,605 --> 01:15:09,488
來，你們這些死人骨頭！快！
不然我送你們進沾膠廠！
Come on, you bony devils! Hurry up!
Or I'll send you to the glue factory!

495
01:15:09,558 --> 01:15:10,722
強力膠！
Elmer!

496
01:15:11,535 --> 01:15:13,007
往牆進攻！
To the walls!

497
01:15:16,292 --> 01:15:18,896
我把你切成一片片的！不，不！
I'll slice you to ribbons! No, no!

498
01:15:43,730 --> 01:15:45,466
慢著！小心！
Wait! Look out!

499
01:15:53,010 --> 01:15:56,185
-嘿，你是我的人，甜心！
-走開！
. Hey, you're mine, sweetie!
. Get off of her!

500
01:16:03,396 --> 01:16:04,663
可惡！
Damn you!

501
01:16:05,372 --> 01:16:09,952
守護死亡志記，小子們！
否則就死在惡魔的火
Defend the Necronomicon, lads!
Or perish in the devil's fire!

502
01:16:14,653 --> 01:16:17,359
-陛下
-看好志記！
. My lord.
. Stay with the book!

503
01:16:17,567 --> 01:16:19,439
志記會是我們的！
The book will be ours!

504
01:16:41,990 --> 01:16:43,018
嗨！
Hello!

505
01:16:53,582 --> 01:16:55,215
這書是我的！
The book is mine!

506
01:16:59,813 --> 01:17:01,285

我把你剁個稀巴爛
I'll cut your gizzard out.

508
01:17:12,678 --> 01:17:14,150
去哪了？
Where'd he go?

509
01:17:25,342 --> 01:17:26,814

Crazy bitch, get off me!
You're tearing my eyes out!

512
01:18:05,209 --> 01:18:06,545
妖女！
You witch!

513
01:18:13,450 --> 01:18:14,420
對
Right.

514

你以前認為我很美的
You found me beautiful once.

515
01:18:24,841 --> 01:18:27,376
蜜糖，你變成醜八怪了
Honey, you got real ugly.

516
01:18:46,818 --> 01:18:48,382
在這
There we are.

517
01:18:57,337 --> 01:18:59,175
你要來狠的？
You wanna play rough?

518
01:19:10,571 --> 01:19:11,803
好！
All right!

519
01:19:35,296 --> 01:19:36,963
你慘了！
You're going down!

520
01:19:38,076 --> 01:19:40,577
-我往上走！
-我追你到底！
. I'm going up!

521
01:20:12,114 --> 01:20:13,244
抓他！
Get him!

522
01:20:15,699 --> 01:20:16,863
借過！
Excuse me!

523
01:20:17,005 --> 01:20:18,843
來！對！
Come on! All right!

524
01:20:21,461 --> 01:20:24,533
你激怒我的，你這醜八怪！
You're pissin' me off,
you ugly son of a bitch!

525
01:20:27,291 --> 01:20:28,284
不！
No!

526
01:20:46,822 --> 01:20:49,700
我要把你毀容了！
I'll spoil those good looks!

527
01:20:52,819 --> 01:20:54,291
暗箭傷人！
Backstabber!

528
01:20:59,854 --> 01:21:01,224
別動！
Hold still!

來囉！
Tallyho!

530
01:21:25,785 --> 01:21:30,571
-我們守不下去了！
-一定要守！要保護志記！
. We can't hold the battlements!
. We will hold! We must protect the book!

531
01:21:30,844 --> 01:21:33,448
紅衣亨利呢？他怎麼還...
Where's Henry the Red? Why's he not...

532
01:21:35,233 --> 01:21:37,676
我們被遺棄了！
We are deserted!

533
01:21:39,085 --> 01:21:40,752
我們勢力薄弱！
We're overwhelmed!

534
01:22:03,006 --> 01:22:05,245
我要跟你沒完沒了
I got a bone to pick with you.

535
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,118
來！
