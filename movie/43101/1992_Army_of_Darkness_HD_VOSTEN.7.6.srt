1
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,130
My name is Ash,

2
00:00:49,131 --> 00:00:51,633
and I am a slave.

3
00:00:55,094 --> 00:01:00,516
Close as I can figure it the year is 13000
AD and I'm being dragged to my death.

4
00:01:00,517 --> 00:01:01,933
It wasn't always like this.

5
00:01:03,352 --> 00:01:05,645
I had a real life... once.

6
00:01:07,272 --> 00:01:08,356
A job.

7
00:01:14,445 --> 00:01:19,323
Amm.. Hardware, out 12.
Shop smart, shop S-Mart.

8
00:01:19,324 --> 00:01:21,034
I had a wonderful girlfriend...

9
00:01:21,451 --> 00:01:22,702
Linda.

10
00:01:25,287 --> 00:01:28,915
Together we drove to a small cabin
in the mountains.

11
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,358
It seemas that an archeologist
have come to this remote place

12
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:36,860
to translate and study

13
00:01:36,861 --> 00:01:39,133
his latest find.

14
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:45,180
Necronomicon Ex Mortis.
The Book Of The Dead.

15
00:01:46,181 --> 00:01:47,890
Bound in human flesh

16
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:51,476
and inked in blood.

17
00:01:51,477 --> 00:01:55,230
This ancient Cimmerian text contained
bizarre burial rights,

18
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:59,817
Funerary incantations and
demon ressurection passages.

19
00:02:00,318 --> 00:02:02,945
It was never ment for the
world of the living.

20
00:02:03,529 --> 00:02:06,781
The book awoke something dark in the woods.

21
00:02:13,162 --> 00:02:15,538
It took Linda.

22
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:18,500
And than it came... for me.

23
00:02:19,502 --> 00:02:22,169
It got into my hand and it went bad.

24
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,298
So I lopped it off at the wrist.

25
00:02:30,094 --> 00:02:31,844
But that didn't stop it.

26
00:02:31,845 --> 00:02:34,347
It came back.

27
00:02:36,015 --> 00:02:38,600
Big time.

28
00:02:54,782 --> 00:02:58,285
For God's sake, how do you stop it?! NO!

29
00:03:19,095 --> 00:03:24,849
ARMY OF DARKNESS

30
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:32,849
Subtitles provider:
Sibirski

31
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:14,560
Where the hell...

32
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,111
Wow... now... easy now chief.

33
00:04:26,112 --> 00:04:28,279
Amm... I don't know how I got here,

34
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,576
and... amm... I'm not
looking for any trouble.

35
00:04:34,785 --> 00:04:36,995
What a piece of armor is this?

36
00:04:38,122 --> 00:04:39,414
Wiseman!

37
00:04:45,003 --> 00:04:49,466
Mu lord, I believe he is the one
written of in the Necronomicon.

38
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:54,844
He who is prophesized to fall from the heavens
and delier us from the terrors of the Deadites.

39
00:04:54,845 --> 00:04:56,304
What? That bafoon?

40
00:04:58,181 --> 00:05:01,933
Likely, he is one of the Henry's men!

41
00:05:05,313 --> 00:05:08,523
I say to the pit with him!

42
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:10,859
To the pit!

43
00:05:13,486 --> 00:05:16,070
You miserable bastard!

44
00:05:17,656 --> 00:05:22,910
Get off of me!

45
00:05:39,508 --> 00:05:41,789
All right men, you've got
something to look forward to...

46
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,405
Lor Arthur approaches! Raise the port!

47
00:06:52,072 --> 00:06:53,864
Lord Arthur!

48
00:06:53,865 --> 00:06:55,407
Where is my brother?

49
00:06:55,408 --> 00:06:57,242
Did he not ride with you?

50
00:06:57,243 --> 00:06:59,452
Aye!

51
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:03,331
And fought valiantly. Last night
he fell in to Duke Henry's men.

52
00:07:03,374 --> 00:07:06,751
I'm sorry Sheila.

53
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:12,297
Stop it you bastards! Barbarians!

54
00:07:23,641 --> 00:07:27,560
Stop it! Stop it you little brat!

55
00:07:27,561 --> 00:07:29,311
Thou art a murderer! Black murderer!

56
00:07:35,652 --> 00:07:39,780
My brother's death shall be avenged!

57
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:55,543
Company pull!

58
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:06,761
Kill him! Into the pit!

59
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:17,645
You sir, are not one of my vassals.

60
00:08:18,855 --> 00:08:21,148
Who are you?

61
00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:23,651
Who want's to know?

62
00:08:23,944 --> 00:08:31,324
I am Henry the Red. Duke of Shale, Lord of
the Northlands and leader of its people.

63
00:08:31,325 --> 00:08:34,118
Well hello mister Mr. Fancypants.

64
00:08:34,786 --> 00:08:41,584
I got news for you pal, you ain't leadin'
but two things now: Jack and shit.
And Jack left town.

65
00:08:41,585 --> 00:08:43,335
Shut your mouth!

66
00:08:43,377 --> 00:08:45,879
Gentleman, lord Arthur!

67
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:57,388
There is an evil awakened in this land,

68
00:08:57,389 --> 00:09:01,727
and while my people fight
to their very soul against it,

69
00:09:01,728 --> 00:09:04,102
you Henry the Red, waged war on us!

70
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:11,234
- Charlatan! It was you who
raised your swords on us.

71
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:14,236
And this evil is fought my people as well!

72
00:09:14,237 --> 00:09:17,636
Your people are no better
than the foul corruption

73
00:09:17,637 --> 00:09:20,283
that lies in the bowels of that pit!

74
00:09:21,702 --> 00:09:26,164
May God have mercy on your souls.

75
00:09:39,426 --> 00:09:43,595
God's name, what hell lurkes there?!

76
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,561
Aye. Into the pit with the
bloodthirsty sons of whores!

77
00:10:32,638 --> 00:10:37,517
- Heavenly God!
- He's escaping!

78
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:25,684
Wow! Holt it! Wait a minute...

79
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,061
You gotta understand

80
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,815
I've never even saw these assholes before!

81
00:11:37,737 --> 00:11:40,928
Henry, you gotta tell
him you don't know me.

82
00:11:40,929 --> 00:11:43,282
We never met. Tell 'em!

83
00:11:45,368 --> 00:11:48,287
I do not think he'll listen, lad.

84
00:11:49,623 --> 00:11:54,501
Look, I'm telling you.
You've got the wrong guy.

85
00:13:30,168 --> 00:13:31,878
Spikes.

86
00:13:32,671 --> 00:13:34,671
Ay, he said spikes, give him spikes.

87
00:13:48,934 --> 00:13:50,893
Make way!

88
00:13:50,894 --> 00:13:52,604
Strange one!

89
00:14:03,572 --> 00:14:06,031
Strange one!

90
00:14:30,053 --> 00:14:32,388
Damn you. Damn you.

91
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:58,922
You know, your shoelace is untied.

92
00:16:09,348 --> 00:16:11,849
Alright,

93
00:16:12,476 --> 00:16:14,978
who want some?

94
00:16:15,145 --> 00:16:17,188
Who's next?

95
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:20,024
Huh? How 'bout it?

96
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,402
Who want some?!

97
00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:26,321
Huh? Who want's to have a little?

98
00:16:30,158 --> 00:16:32,159
You!

99
00:16:32,243 --> 00:16:34,745
You want some more?

100
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:41,001
You want a little?

101
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,422
Do ya? Want some more?! Huh?!

102
00:17:02,227 --> 00:17:06,522
Now get on those horses
and get out of here.

103
00:17:08,358 --> 00:17:11,110
Let him go!

104
00:17:33,213 --> 00:17:35,715
- Halt!
- Thank you generous hosts!

105
00:17:39,468 --> 00:17:41,636
Swordfight!

106
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:53,981
For that arrogance I shall see you dead.

107
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,910
Yeah. All right you primitive screwheads!
Listen up!

108
00:18:09,453 --> 00:18:11,828
See this?!

109
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:16,833
This is my BOOM-STICK!

110
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:22,088
12 gauge double-bareled Remington,
S-Mart's top of the line.

111
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:25,216
You can find this on sporting good's
department.

112
00:18:25,217 --> 00:18:29,178
That's right this sweet baby
was made in Grandrappids Michigen.

113
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:31,471
Retails are about 109.95$

114
00:18:31,472 --> 00:18:36,809
It has a wallnut stock, cobalt blue steel
and a hear trigger.

115
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:40,271
That's right. Shop smart. Shop S-Mart!

116
00:18:42,439 --> 00:18:44,941
YOU GOT THAT!

117
00:18:44,942 --> 00:18:52,941
Now I swear, next one of you primates,
even touches me...

118
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:26,394
Now, let's talk about how I get home.

119
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,550
I pray thee to forgive me, my lord.
I believed thee one of Henry's men.

120
00:20:02,551 --> 00:20:08,639
First you wanna kill me, now
you wanna kiss me. Blow.

121
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:15,291
So, what's the deal? Can
you send me back or not?

122
00:20:15,292 --> 00:20:20,087
Only the Necronomicon has the power.
And a holy book which we also require.

123
00:20:20,088 --> 00:20:24,903
Within its pages are passages,
that can send you back in your time.

124
00:20:24,904 --> 00:20:27,948
Only you the Promised One can quest for it.

125
00:20:27,949 --> 00:20:31,347
I don't want your book, I
don't want your bullshit,

126
00:20:31,348 --> 00:20:34,703
just send me back to my own
time, pronto, today ch...

127
00:20:44,588 --> 00:20:47,924
You shall die!

128
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,014
You shall never taim the Necronomicon!

129
00:20:57,015 --> 00:21:03,604
We shall feast upon your souls!

130
00:21:23,872 --> 00:21:27,625
It's a trick. Get an axe.

131
00:21:40,928 --> 00:21:43,430
Oh my eyes! I'm blind!

132
00:21:51,729 --> 00:21:54,231
Yo she-bitch!

133
00:21:55,066 --> 00:21:57,568
Let's go.

134
00:22:18,961 --> 00:22:21,818
If the Necronomicon falls
into the hands of Deadites,

135
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:25,050
the whole mankind can be
consumed by this evil.

136
00:22:25,051 --> 00:22:27,760
Now, will thou quest for the book?!

137
00:22:40,521 --> 00:22:43,106
That one.

138
00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:12,215
Groovie!

139
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,812
What's the matter? Raised in a barn?
Shut the door.

140
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:43,534
The wiseman says thou art the Promised One.

141
00:23:46,663 --> 00:23:53,210
It is said thee will journey for the book to help us.
And thou will lead our people against the evil.

142
00:23:53,211 --> 00:23:57,380
Only reason I'm going to get
the book is to get home...

143
00:24:02,176 --> 00:24:04,678
I believe thou will be
leaving in the morning.

144
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:05,929
Don't touch that.

145
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:10,016
Your primitive intelect wouldn't understand
alloyes and composition and...

146
00:24:10,017 --> 00:24:18,016
things with molecular stucture and...
What are you doing here, anyway?

147
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,901
I want to say that all of my hopes
and prayers go with thee,

148
00:24:22,902 --> 00:24:25,404
and I made this for thee.

149
00:24:26,072 --> 00:24:28,949
Good, I need hors' blanket.

150
00:24:50,969 --> 00:24:54,471
Gimme some sugar baby.

151
00:25:34,506 --> 00:25:36,132
What? What is it?

152
00:25:36,133 --> 00:25:44,132
This path will lead you to an unholy place, a cemetery.
There a Necronomicon awates.

153
00:25:46,976 --> 00:25:51,771
When thou retreves the book from its cradle
you must recite the words:

154
00:25:51,772 --> 00:25:54,565
Clatoo, Verata, Nicto.

155
00:25:54,566 --> 00:25:56,776
Clatoo, Verata, Nicto. OK.

156
00:25:57,526 --> 00:25:59,986
Well, repeat them.

157
00:25:59,987 --> 00:26:02,280
Clatoo, Verata, Nicto.

158
00:26:02,281 --> 00:26:03,156
Again!

159
00:26:03,157 --> 00:26:07,117
I got it! I got it! I know
your damn words alright?!

160
00:26:07,118 --> 00:26:09,871
Now you get his straight, both of you!

161
00:26:09,872 --> 00:26:15,833
If I get that book, you send me back.
After that I'm history.

162
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,828
What is it boy?

163
00:29:35,091 --> 00:29:37,593
Ready, aim, fire!

164
00:29:46,268 --> 00:29:49,520
Oh, ough, you lousy little...

165
00:30:56,662 --> 00:30:59,121
What a horrible nightmare. Oh God!

166
00:30:59,581 --> 00:31:02,208
I can't move!

167
00:31:45,579 --> 00:31:51,334
OK little fella. How 'bout
some hot chocolate? Huh?!

168
00:32:00,384 --> 00:32:03,594
How'd you like a taste of that?
How'd you like a...

169
00:32:21,903 --> 00:32:25,864
Oh dear God, it's growing bigger!

170
00:32:42,587 --> 00:32:46,048
I'm bling. I'm blind.

171
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,933
Where are you taking me?

172
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,316
What are you?

173
00:33:07,317 --> 00:33:09,485
Are you me?

174
00:33:09,486 --> 00:33:11,487
I'm bad ASh.

175
00:33:11,488 --> 00:33:15,866
And you're good Ash.
Little goody two-shoes!

176
00:33:45,016 --> 00:33:51,522
Good, bad... I'm the guy with a gun.

177
00:34:50,282 --> 00:34:55,869
That'll teach ya. That'll teach ya.

178
00:34:56,578 --> 00:34:59,455
You shall never retrev the Necronomicon!

179
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:02,917
You'll die in the graveyard
before you get it!

180
00:35:02,918 --> 00:35:07,046
Hey, what's that you got on you face?

181
00:35:07,797 --> 00:35:10,633
I'll come back for you!

182
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,922
Three books?!

183
00:36:47,133 --> 00:36:49,635
Wait a minute. Hold it.

184
00:36:49,802 --> 00:36:53,388
Nobody said anything about three books.

185
00:36:54,681 --> 00:36:56,641
Like... like what am I supposed to do?

186
00:36:56,642 --> 00:37:01,146
Take one book, or all books?

187
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:02,365
Or... or what?

188
00:38:58,456 --> 00:39:03,376
You... I'll get back to you.

189
00:39:07,547 --> 00:39:10,382
Well, it seems fairly obvious.

190
00:39:13,302 --> 00:39:17,763
Ouh, wait a minute... the words...
rght, right, right.

191
00:39:17,764 --> 00:39:20,308
Say the words.

192
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:25,478
CLATOO...

193
00:39:25,479 --> 00:39:27,063
VERATA...

194
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:29,566
N...

195
00:39:35,238 --> 00:39:40,533
Nicty, Nictor, Nicle...

196
00:39:47,958 --> 00:39:51,251
It's an "N" word. Definitely an "N" word.

197
00:40:01,845 --> 00:40:08,225
CLATOO, VERATA, N@$♪*%^!...

198
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:25,281
OK than. That's it!

199
00:40:34,957 --> 00:40:40,043
Hey, wait a minute. Everything's cool.

200
00:40:40,044 --> 00:40:42,170
I said the words!

201
00:40:42,171 --> 00:40:46,966
I did! No!

202
00:40:53,389 --> 00:40:57,559
You people seek cover!

203
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:03,981
Seek your children!

204
00:41:04,149 --> 00:41:07,693
Something's wrong! Something's amiss!

205
00:42:17,046 --> 00:42:20,173
I'll crush you, I'll mash
you, you bony things...

206
00:42:45,737 --> 00:42:49,323
I'm threw being their garbidge boy.
I did my part.

207
00:42:49,324 --> 00:42:53,035
Now I want back. Like in the deal.

208
00:43:04,045 --> 00:43:08,548
I live...

209
00:43:09,299 --> 00:43:12,427
again!

210
00:43:20,935 --> 00:43:27,148
Hey, the Promised One! The
Promised One has returned!

211
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,201
He is the Promised One!

212
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:43,829
He brought the Necronomicon!

213
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:50,084
Yeah, great, great. Fuck out of my face.

214
00:43:55,714 --> 00:44:00,885
The Necronomicon quickly. Did
you bring the Necronomicon?

215
00:44:00,886 --> 00:44:04,555
- Yeah, it's... it's just that...
- Just what?!

216
00:44:05,098 --> 00:44:07,934
Nothing. Here.

217
00:44:14,022 --> 00:44:16,774
Now send me back, like in the deal.

218
00:44:17,067 --> 00:44:21,570
When you removed the Necronomicon from
the cradle, did yopu speak the words?

219
00:44:21,904 --> 00:44:25,241
- Yeah, basically...
- Did you speak the exact words?

220
00:44:25,242 --> 00:44:30,911
Well maybe I didn't say every single tiny little
syllable, no, but basically I said them, yeah.

221
00:44:30,912 --> 00:44:37,459
Damn thee fool! Thou has doomed us all! When
thee spoke the words the army of the dead awoke!

222
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,377
Now, wow, wow right there spinach-chin.

223
00:44:39,378 --> 00:44:43,922
You said that you can clean this
mess up, once you got that book.

224
00:44:43,923 --> 00:44:46,717
You said there's a passage in there that
can rid this thing and send me back.

225
00:44:46,718 --> 00:44:51,679
It's true. The book still posesses the power
to send you back, but to us... It is useless!

226
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:57,642
The evil has a terrible hunger for the Necronomicon!
And it will come here, to get it.

227
00:44:57,643 --> 00:45:01,854
We had a deal. You wanted the
damn book, I got it for ya.

228
00:45:01,855 --> 00:45:04,295
I did my part now you send me back!

229
00:45:04,296 --> 00:45:10,862
Very well. As we are a men of our word
we shall honor a bargain.

230
00:45:10,863 --> 00:45:14,865
The Wiseman shall return
you to your own time.

231
00:45:14,866 --> 00:45:16,701
Yeah?!

232
00:45:17,202 --> 00:45:18,953
We thought he was the One.

233
00:45:18,954 --> 00:45:21,685
Yeah, right, cause that was the deal.

234
00:45:21,686 --> 00:45:26,168
When do you think we could... start
with all the... thing in a...

235
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:35,677
- When do you think we can start with all the... ceremony and...
- Wretched excuse for a man!

236
00:45:37,511 --> 00:45:41,139
The Wiseman was a fool to trusted you.

237
00:45:41,849 --> 00:45:44,475
I knew he couldn't be trusted.

238
00:45:47,186 --> 00:45:49,605
I still believe that thou will help us.

239
00:45:49,772 --> 00:45:52,523
Oh, Sheila, don't you get it?

240
00:45:52,524 --> 00:45:58,655
It's over. I didn't have what it took.

241
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:01,740
So long.

242
00:46:05,286 --> 00:46:11,749
But what of all the things we share? What of
all the sweet words that you spoke in private?

243
00:46:13,293 --> 00:46:17,900
Oh, well that's just what we call
pillow-talk, baby. That's all.

244
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:20,923
It was more than that.

245
00:46:20,966 --> 00:46:23,593
I still have faith in thee.

246
00:46:23,594 --> 00:46:28,014
I still believe that thou
will stay and save us.

247
00:46:32,892 --> 00:46:35,227
I... Covard.

248
00:46:57,289 --> 00:46:59,499
Help me!

249
00:46:59,916 --> 00:47:02,501
Sheila!

250
00:47:14,179 --> 00:47:17,724
Hold your arms you'll hit the girl!

251
00:47:28,149 --> 00:47:30,025
Damn you!

252
00:47:48,209 --> 00:47:53,212
Dig damn you! Dig faster!

253
00:47:53,213 --> 00:47:55,924
I shall command every wormy
flesh son of a bitch...

254
00:47:55,925 --> 00:47:59,217
- ...that ever died in battle.
- Thank you sir!

255
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:04,324
- You there hansom me now! -Aye my leash! -We
shall strong their castle and get my book!

256
00:48:10,478 --> 00:48:18,193
Welcome back to the land of the living.
Now pick up a showel and get digging!

257
00:48:18,985 --> 00:48:21,987
Bring on the witch!

258
00:48:32,705 --> 00:48:35,332
Gimme some sugar baby!

259
00:48:40,587 --> 00:48:44,673
Boy, aren't you a sweet little thing?

260
00:48:44,674 --> 00:48:47,884
Don't touch me you foul thing.

261
00:48:47,885 --> 00:48:50,011
Come on.

262
00:48:50,012 --> 00:48:53,598
That's it.

263
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:57,184
We've got planes for you valley girl! Move!

264
00:49:13,366 --> 00:49:17,953
The scout approaches!

265
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,876
- Arise.
- My lord.

266
00:49:26,877 --> 00:49:30,505
An army of the dead is gathering in the
wilderness, and approaches the castle.

267
00:49:30,506 --> 00:49:33,508
- How far from here?
- 'Bout two days ride.

268
00:49:34,384 --> 00:49:38,304
- Perhaps we should flee as soon as possible?
- We'll be safe in the mountains.

269
00:49:38,305 --> 00:49:41,223
It is written Arthur! It is been fortold!

270
00:49:41,224 --> 00:49:45,602
- It'll take our souls!
- We will die!

271
00:49:47,104 --> 00:49:54,776
Go ahead and run! Run home and cry to mama!

272
00:49:54,777 --> 00:50:02,776
Me, I threw running! I say we
stay here and fight it out.

273
00:50:03,827 --> 00:50:08,413
Are all men from the future
loud mouth braggarts?!

274
00:50:08,414 --> 00:50:13,709
Nope. Just me baby. Just me.

275
00:50:14,085 --> 00:50:18,547
How we'll fight an army of the dead at
our castle's walls?

276
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:19,883
How will you fight that?

277
00:50:19,884 --> 00:50:20,924
More words?!

278
00:50:20,925 --> 00:50:26,179
Most of our people had already fled.
We are but 60 men.

279
00:50:26,263 --> 00:50:29,265
Than we'll get Henry the Red
and his men to fight with us.

280
00:50:34,812 --> 00:50:36,688
Now, who's with me?!

281
00:50:50,659 --> 00:50:52,285
I'll stand by ya.

282
00:50:54,787 --> 00:50:57,330
You can count on my steel.

283
00:50:57,331 --> 00:50:59,291
I'll offer up my courage.

284
00:50:59,292 --> 00:51:01,793
And me!

285
00:51:27,607 --> 00:51:29,650
Well my dear...

286
00:51:29,651 --> 00:51:32,861
say hello to the boys.

287
00:51:45,206 --> 00:51:51,669
I may be bad, but I feel... good.

288
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:54,547
-Who rules?
-You my lord!
-You sir!

289
00:51:54,548 --> 00:51:58,384
To the castle!

290
00:53:18,871 --> 00:53:23,375
They are comming! The Deadites approach!

291
00:53:39,972 --> 00:53:42,349
There's so many damn of 'em.

292
00:53:45,269 --> 00:53:51,983
Maybe... just maybe my boys'll
stop 'em from taking the book.

293
00:53:55,611 --> 00:54:01,199
Yeah, maybe I'm a Chinese jet pilot.

294
00:54:34,687 --> 00:54:38,231
On the battle-station! Get
those rocks on the double!

295
00:54:38,232 --> 00:54:39,671
Ready the catapult!

296
00:54:39,672 --> 00:54:42,402
By God let's give them one for!

297
00:54:50,201 --> 00:54:53,995
Company halts! Company halt!

298
00:55:46,249 --> 00:55:50,419
- Bing on the scout!
- My Lord, we have position on both fronts.

299
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:53,965
- Fine, fine, fine... Where
are they keeping my book?

300
00:55:53,966 --> 00:55:56,174
There my Lord, beyond the wall.

301
00:55:56,175 --> 00:55:58,301
That would be the most likely place.

302
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:03,430
Right. Bring me forth into the castle!

303
00:56:03,431 --> 00:56:06,766
Forward!

304
00:56:06,767 --> 00:56:11,311
By havoc let them loose the dogs of war!

305
00:56:11,312 --> 00:56:14,314
To the castle!

306
00:56:17,943 --> 00:56:21,237
Death to the mortals!

307
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:25,158
Arrows!

308
00:56:25,159 --> 00:56:27,743
Torch by!

309
00:57:02,816 --> 00:57:04,859
Steady...

310
00:57:10,906 --> 00:57:14,283
Fire!

311
00:57:45,394 --> 00:57:49,022
Squire, the second division
approaching from the south.

312
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,568
Ram the gates!

313
00:57:56,821 --> 00:58:01,366
Catapults!

314
00:58:09,665 --> 00:58:10,165
Fire!

315
00:58:29,141 --> 00:58:33,060
-Seek cover!
-Watch out!
-Make way!

316
00:58:46,448 --> 00:58:49,491
Ough! Oh, you miserable bags of bones!

317
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:57,491
Pick yourselves up and sally arh...
sally agh... sally forth.

318
00:59:15,348 --> 00:59:18,017
Forward!

319
00:59:19,352 --> 00:59:22,562
Clutches the door, now!

320
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,334
Oooh! That's gotta hurt!

321
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:53,672
Down you creatures! Arrows!

322
01:00:03,848 --> 01:00:07,850
We've broken through! The castle's ours!

323
01:00:50,139 --> 01:00:52,890
Fall back!

324
01:00:52,891 --> 01:00:55,559
Protect the book!

325
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:58,187
God save us all.

326
01:01:02,441 --> 01:01:05,568
Say hello to the 21st century.

327
01:01:18,163 --> 01:01:21,915
Come on! I got plenty for everybody!

328
01:01:34,094 --> 01:01:37,638
Up and get him!

329
01:02:11,793 --> 01:02:14,169
Sheila...

330
01:02:38,357 --> 01:02:40,692
We've secured the cortyard, my Lord.

331
01:02:40,693 --> 01:02:42,819
Excellent.

332
01:03:20,019 --> 01:03:23,104
- My Lord...
- Stay with the book!

333
01:03:23,105 --> 01:03:25,606
A bok where we are.

334
01:03:29,069 --> 01:03:33,572
The Red! The Red! Duke Henry
and his men arrived!

335
01:03:36,116 --> 01:03:42,663
Bows, bolts arms and heads!

336
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:25,909
The book is mine.

337
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:35,835
Now I'll cut your desert out.

338
01:04:37,086 --> 01:04:39,171
Hey, where'd he go? Hey!

339
01:04:49,263 --> 01:04:51,640
Come to papa.

340
01:04:51,933 --> 01:04:53,516
Get him.

341
01:05:19,957 --> 01:05:24,293
Oh you crazy bitch, get off me!

342
01:05:37,597 --> 01:05:40,181
You found me beautiful once.

343
01:05:40,182 --> 01:05:44,686
Honey, you got real ugly.

344
01:05:59,992 --> 01:06:02,536
There we are.

345
01:06:10,501 --> 01:06:16,047
Wanna play rough, ey?

346
01:06:29,642 --> 01:06:32,436
Prepare to die!

347
01:06:44,196 --> 01:06:47,031
You're going down.

348
01:06:47,032 --> 01:06:49,284
I'm goin' up.

349
01:06:49,326 --> 01:06:51,410
I'm coming for ya!

350
01:07:42,122 --> 01:07:46,625
I'll spoil those good looks! Backstabber!

351
01:08:13,149 --> 01:08:15,233
We cant hold the battle!

352
01:08:15,234 --> 01:08:17,819
We will hold! We must protect the book!

353
01:08:29,413 --> 01:08:33,625
I got a bone to pick with you. Come on.

354
01:09:22,042 --> 01:09:24,753
At last! The book!

355
01:09:29,882 --> 01:09:32,050
I posses the Necronomicon!

356
01:09:32,051 --> 01:09:36,346
No I'll have my vengeance!

357
01:09:36,347 --> 01:09:40,975
Buckle up bonehead, cause
you're going for a ride.

358
01:09:54,987 --> 01:09:57,489
Victory is ours!

359
01:09:59,492 --> 01:10:03,369
- Retreat! Retreat!
- Let's get the hell out of here!

360
01:11:27,193 --> 01:11:29,235
Hey Henry.

361
01:11:29,236 --> 01:11:30,278
How's it going?

362
01:11:31,029 --> 01:11:34,157
Well won my friend.

363
01:11:40,454 --> 01:11:42,372
We're brother's then...

364
01:11:42,957 --> 01:11:46,250
a new kingdom shall be born!

365
01:11:47,752 --> 01:11:51,506
The book tells us that once
you drink this liquid,

366
01:11:51,507 --> 01:11:55,133
and recite the words: Clatoo, Verata, Nicto

367
01:11:55,134 --> 01:11:59,304
thou shall awaken in thou own time.

368
01:12:00,388 --> 01:12:05,101
Remember, you must recite
the words exactly.

369
01:12:57,313 --> 01:12:59,314
I thought about staying.

370
01:12:59,315 --> 01:13:03,484
They offered me a chance to
lead them, teach them... to...

371
01:13:03,485 --> 01:13:05,152
to be king!

372
01:13:05,486 --> 01:13:07,237
But my place is here,

373
01:13:07,238 --> 01:13:09,948
so I swallow the juice, said the words,

374
01:13:09,949 --> 01:13:11,115
and here I am.

375
01:13:11,116 --> 01:13:13,618
Did you said the words right this time?

376
01:13:14,828 --> 01:13:18,581
Well maybe I didn't say every
single tiny little syllable,

377
01:13:18,582 --> 01:13:20,416
no, but basically I said them, yeah.

378
01:13:21,876 --> 01:13:23,669
Basically...

379
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:29,048
You know that story how
you could have been king?

380
01:13:30,008 --> 01:13:32,385
I... think it's kind a cute.

381
01:13:33,595 --> 01:13:34,845
Yeah.

382
01:13:53,653 --> 01:13:55,237
Die!

383
01:14:09,709 --> 01:14:13,212
Lady I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave the store.

384
01:14:13,213 --> 01:14:15,338
Who the hell are you?!

385
01:14:15,464 --> 01:14:16,882
Name's Ash...

386
01:14:18,926 --> 01:14:20,218
House-wares.

387
01:14:41,111 --> 01:14:43,863
I'll swallow your soul!

388
01:14:43,864 --> 01:14:44,948
Come get some.

389
01:15:05,508 --> 01:15:08,844
Sure I could 've stayed in the past...

390
01:15:09,886 --> 01:15:11,554
coul of even been king...

391
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:18,060
But in my own way... I am king.

392
01:15:19,395 --> 01:15:21,063
Hail to the king baby.
