<i>And then it came for me.</i>

21
00:02:00,225 --> 00:02:05,205
邪魔進到我手裏
我只好斷腕自保

<i>So I lopped it off at the wrist.</i>

22
00:02:11,482 --> 00:02:14,120

He who is prophesied to fall

34
00:04:33,195 --> 00:04:35,673

...and deliver us from
the terrors of the Deadites.

35
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,678
什麼？那個傻子？
What? That buffoon?

36
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:39,286
他...
Likely...

37
00:04:39,695 --> 00:04:42,104
...比較像亨利手下的人
...he's one of Henry's men!

38

41
00:04:58,824 --> 00:05:00,320

42
00:05:02,744 --> 00:05:04,080
放開我！
Let me go!

43
00:05:12,661 --> 00:05:14,157
進城堡！

好了！
All right, you men!

00:05:37,284 --> 00:05:41,533
回到城堡後你將有個驚喜
You've got something to look forward to
when you get back to the castle!

49
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:45,919
亞瑟王來到！開鐵門！
Lord Arthur approaches!
Raise the portcullis!

50
00:05:47,971 --> 00:05:51,888
亞瑟王！亞瑟王來到！
Lord Arthur! Lord Arthur approaches!

51
00:06:42,077 --> 00:06:46,292
亞瑟王，我兄弟呢？沒跟您一起嗎？
Lord Arthur, where is my brother?
Did he not ride with you?

52
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:48,498
啊，驍勇善戰

團隊，候令！

除去他的項圈！
Get that yoke off him!

66
00:08:04,056 --> 00:08:06,934
你不是我的奴隸
You, sir, are not one of my vassals.

67
00:08:08,747 --> 00:08:10,151
你是誰？
Who are you?

68
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:12,758
誰在問？
Who wants to know?

69
00:08:13,905 --> 00:08:17,149
我是紅衣亨利，薛爾公爵

70
00:08:17,524 --> 00:08:20,436

Lord of the Northlands
and leader of its peoples.

71

跟你說吧，老兄
Well, hello, Mister Fancy Pants.
I got news for you, pal.

72
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,072
現在你只領導兩樣事情
狗跟屎
You ain't leading but two things right now,
jack and shit.

73
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,122
-這裏沒狗
-閉上鳥嘴！
. And Jack left town.
. Shut your bleedin' hole!

74
00:08:32,465 --> 00:08:35,274
紳士們，亞瑟王！
Gentlemen, Lord Arthur!

75
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,528
惡魔已蘇醒了
There is an evil awakened in this land.

76
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:51,252
我的手下拼命抵抗...
And while my people fight
for their very souls against it...

77
00:08:51,461 --> 00:08:54,202
...你，紅衣亨利，向我們宣戰
...you, Henry the Red, wage war on us.

78
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,982

79
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,310
是你先攻擊我們的
It was you who first turned
your swords on us.

80
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:04,382
這個惡魔也已敗壞了我的手下！
And this evil has befouled
my people as well!

81
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:07,601
你的手下也不見得比那深坑裏的...
Your people are no better
than the foul corruption...

82
00:09:07,676 --> 00:09:09,879
惡魔好多少...
...that lies in the bowels of that pit!

83
00:09:10,055 --> 00:09:11,927
對！你也好不了多少！
Right! You're no better!

84
00:09:12,132 --> 00:09:14,633
願神憐憫你的靈魂
May God have mercy upon your souls.

85
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,998
天啊！是什麼東西？
In God's name!
What hell. Spawned thing lurks there?

86
00:09:38,531 --> 00:09:42,140
把他丟進深坑去跟嗜血雜種作伴
Into the pit
with those bloodthirsty sons of whores.

87
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:43,815
走！
Move!

88
00:09:44,495 --> 00:09:45,488
不！
No!

89
00:10:16,723 --> 00:10:19,361
天！天啊！
God! Heavenly God!

90
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,886
他逃走了！
He's escaping!

91
00:10:26,305 --> 00:10:27,801
抓住他！
Hold him!

92
00:11:02,186 --> 00:11:04,687
他們看起來沒那麼精明了吧？
They don't look so clever now, do they?

93
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:06,432
他嚇壞了！
He's frightened!

94
00:11:09,456 --> 00:11:12,836
喂，喂！等等
Whoa, whoa! Wait a minute.

95
00:11:14,247 --> 00:11:16,416
等等，等一下！
Hold it. Wait a minute!

96
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,659
你得了解，老兄
You gotta understand, man.

97
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:22,217
我之前從沒見過這些混球！
I never even saw these assholes before!

98
00:11:23,158 --> 00:11:24,528
他嚇壞了！
He trembles!

99
00:11:26,442 --> 00:11:28,178
你在等什麼？
What are you waiting for?

100
00:11:28,585 --> 00:11:30,960
亨利，你得告訴他們，你不認識我
Henry, you gotta tell them
you don't know me.

101
00:11:31,668 --> 00:11:33,575
我們素未謀面，說啊！
We never met, tell them!

102
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,700
他不會聽的，小兄弟
I do not think he'll listen, lad.

103
00:11:40,613 --> 00:11:44,828
聽清楚，你們抓錯人了
Look, I'm telling you.
You've got the wrong guy.

104
00:11:55,353 --> 00:11:58,391
跟你說你們抓錯人了
I'm telling you, you got the wrong guy.

105
00:13:14,853 --> 00:13:16,120
啊，你...
Why, you...

106
00:13:21,387 --> 00:13:26,035
-鐵釘
-他說鐵釘！上鐵釘！
. Spikes.
. Hey, he said spikes! Give him spikes!

107
00:13:40,315 --> 00:13:43,090
讓開！陌生人！
Make way! Strange one!

108
00:13:55,056 --> 00:13:56,084
陌生人！
Strange one!

109
00:14:21,388 --> 00:14:23,797
詛咒你
Damn you.

110
00:15:48,895 --> 00:15:51,338
你的鞋帶松了
You know, your shoelace is untied.

111
00:16:02,297 --> 00:16:03,633
好
All right.

112
00:16:05,412 --> 00:16:06,942
誰來挑戰？
Who wants some?

113
00:16:07,924 --> 00:16:09,557
該誰來？
Who's next?

00:16:11,844 --> 00:16:13,316
來啊？
How about it?

誰來？誰要來挑戰？
Who wants some?
Who wants to have a little?

116
00:16:23,135 --> 00:16:24,128
你
You.

117
00:16:28,193 --> 00:16:29,860
你要打嗎？
You want some more?

118
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,930
要嗎？
You want a little?

119
00:16:38,612 --> 00:16:41,250
你？要不要打？
Do you? You want some more?

120
00:16:58,345 --> 00:17:00,915
快滾
Now, get on those horses
and get out of here.

121
00:17:04,543 --> 00:17:05,947
放他們走！
Let them go!

122
00:17:29,468 --> 00:17:30,461
停！
Halt!

拿劍的人！

125
00:17:45,247 --> 00:17:48,958
驕傲的人，我要將你殺死
For that arrogance, I shall see you dead.

126
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:56,765

127
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,616
好
Yeah.

128
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:04,735
你們這些未開化的白癡們，聽好了
All right, you primitive screwheads,
listen up.

129
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,155

00:18:33,323 --> 00:18:38,143
對啦，絕對物超所值
That's right. Shop smart. Shop S. Mart.

137
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,482
懂了嗎？
You got that?

138
00:18:41,497 --> 00:18:43,267
我發誓...
Now, I swear...

139
00:18:44,211 --> 00:18:46,586
...你們誰要是敢...
...the next one of you primates...

140
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,429
...再碰我一下...
...even touches me...

141
00:19:18,986 --> 00:19:23,532
來談談我該怎麼回去吧
Now, let's talk about how I get back home.

142
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,242
我懇求您的寬恕，陛下
I prithee to forgive me, my Lord.

143
00:19:57,647 --> 00:20:00,148
我以為您是亨利的同黨
I believed thee one of Henry's men.

144
00:20:00,495 --> 00:20:03,567
一開始你要殺我，現在你要吻我
First you wanna kill me,
now you wanna kiss me.

145
00:20:05,252 --> 00:20:06,314
滾
Blow.

146
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:13,423
怎麼樣？能不能送我回去？
So what's the deal?
Can you send me back or not?

147
00:20:13,494 --> 00:20:18,006
只有死亡志記才有能力
我們也在找這本邪惡的書
Only the Necronomicon has the power,
an unholy book which we also require.

148
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:22,167
書中記載著如何讓你回到自己的時空
Within its pages are passages
that can send you back to your time.

149
00:20:22,372 --> 00:20:25,044
只有你，上天的使者，才能拿到它
Only you, the promised one,
can quest for it.

150
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:29,363
我不要你的書，也不聽你廢話
I don't want your book.
I don't want your bullshit!

151
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,820
趕快把我送回我的時空
快！快！快...
Just send me back to my own time.
Pronto! Today! Chop...

152
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,987
你該死
You shall die!

153
00:20:51,485 --> 00:20:54,729
你絕不可以拿死亡志記
You shall never take the Necronomicon.

154
00:20:55,438 --> 00:20:59,287
我們將飽餐你的靈魂
We shall feast upon your souls!

155
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:25,049
那是魔法，拿斧頭來
It's a trick. Get an ax.

156
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:34,499
守衛！殺死他！
Guards! Kill her!

157
00:21:35,942 --> 00:21:38,283
抓住巫婆！抓住她！
Capture the witch! Capture the witch!

158
00:21:39,057 --> 00:21:42,129
我的眼睛！我瞎了！天，我瞎了！
My eyes! I'm blind! Oh, God, I'm blind!

159
00:21:44,217 --> 00:21:45,210
不！
No!

160
00:21:50,749 --> 00:21:52,221
喂，妖女！
Yo, she. Bitch!

161
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,267
來啊
Let's go.

162
00:22:17,953 --> 00:22:20,762
如果死亡志記落在邪惡人手中...
If the Necronomicon fell into
the hands of the Deadites...

163
00:22:20,868 --> 00:22:23,438
...所有人類都會被惡魔消滅
...all mankind will be consumed
by this evil.

164
00:22:23,548 --> 00:22:25,957
現在你願意去取書了嗎？
Now will thou quest for the book?

165
00:22:39,864 --> 00:22:41,131
那個
That one.

166
00:23:08,374 --> 00:23:09,778
太棒了
Groovy.

167
00:23:23,315 --> 00:23:26,353
怎麼？你在農場長大的啊？
關上門
What's the matter, you raised in a barn?
Shut the door.

168
00:23:26,733 --> 00:23:29,873
大概是跟這些原始人一樣
都在農場長大的
Probably was raised in a barn,
with all the other primitives.

169
00:23:39,062 --> 00:23:42,134
智者說你是上天派遣來的
The Wisemen say that thou art
the promised one.

170
00:23:45,997 --> 00:23:48,909
據說你要去取書來幫助我們
'Tis said thou wilt journey for the book
to help us.

171
00:23:48,978 --> 00:23:51,684
你會帶領我們抵抗邪魔
And that thou wilt lead our people
against the evil.

172
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:55,037
我唯一目的只是要回家
The only reason I'm going to get the book
is to get home.

173
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,513
聽說你會一早出發
I believe thou wilt be leaving
in the morning.

174
00:24:03,585 --> 00:24:05,081
別碰，拜托
Don't touch that, please!

175
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:08,974
你未開發的智慧無法理解
合成金屬成分...
Your primitive intellect wouldn't
understand alloys and compositions...

176
00:24:09,046 --> 00:24:12,221
...還有原子單位結構...
...and things with molecular structures
and the...

177
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,782
你來這裏幹嘛？
What are you doing here, anyway?

178
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:22,072
我要跟你說我會為你禱告祈福...
I wanted to say that all of my hopes
and prayers go with thee...

179
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,515
...我幫你做了這個
...and I made this for thee.

180
00:24:25,562 --> 00:24:28,063
好，我正需要馬墊
Good. I could use a horse blanket.

181
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:52,428
給我一個吻，寶貝
Give me some sugar, baby.

182
00:25:58,061 --> 00:25:59,557
來，兄弟們！
Come on, boys!

183
00:26:21,044 --> 00:26:22,448
穩住
Steady, now.

184
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:32,634
-什麼？什麼東西？
-這道路將引你到邪惡地點
. What? What is it?
. This path will lead you to an unholy place.

185
00:26:33,171 --> 00:26:36,814
一個墓園，死亡志記就在那裏
A cemetery.
There the Necronomicon awaits.

186
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:44,217
當你拿起書時，你一定要說：
When thou retrievest the book from
its cradle, you must recite the words:

187
00:26:44,461 --> 00:26:47,167
「卡拉吐，    巴拉他，尼克吐」
"Klaatu, barada, nikto."

188
00:26:47,845 --> 00:26:52,196
-卡拉吐，    巴拉他，尼克吐，好
-再念一次
. Klaatu, barada, nikto. Okay.
. Well, repeat them.

189
00:26:53,607 --> 00:26:56,816
-卡拉吐，    巴拉他，尼克吐
-再一次
. Klaatu, barada, nikto.
. Again!

190
00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:00,236
知道了！知道了！
我會念的，好了吧？
I got it! I got it!
I know your damn words, all right?

191
00:27:00,843 --> 00:27:02,978
你們兩個聽清楚
Now, you get this straight,
the both of you!

192
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:05,658
如果我拿到書，你們就送我回去
If I get that book, you send me back.

193
00:27:06,237 --> 00:27:08,372
然後，我就走了
After that, I'm history.

194
00:28:12,437 --> 00:28:14,035
怎麼了？
What is it, boy?

195
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,633
來！
Come on!

196
00:32:28,425 --> 00:32:30,297
快跑！
Ramming speed!

197
00:32:38,677 --> 00:32:40,447
預備，瞄准，開火！
Ready. Aim. Fire!

198
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,704
快點！
Shake a leg!

199
00:33:03,904 --> 00:33:05,674
你這小...
You lousy little...

200
00:33:14,256 --> 00:33:17,670
我會一個一個把你們都...
Yeah! I'm gonna hunt down all you...

201
00:33:34,793 --> 00:33:37,100
小渾蛋們！好！
You little bastards! All right!

202
00:33:37,372 --> 00:33:41,381
我會一個一個壓扁你們
壓得扁扁的，你等著吧！
I'll crush each and every one of you.
I'll crush you to pieces, I'm telling you!

203
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,738
我會把你打得...
I'll squash you so hard,
you'll have to look up to see...

204
00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:46,281
嘿，傻蛋！
Hey, dumb ass!

205
00:33:50,338 --> 00:33:51,674
大好機會！
Surf's up!

206
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:04,364
一起來！
All together now!

207
00:34:22,198 --> 00:34:23,294
狗屎！
Shit!

208
00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:36,700
小聲，慢慢來
Quietly. Gently.

209
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:46,046
慢點，傻大個，慢點
Easy, big fella. Easy.

210
00:35:00,256 --> 00:35:03,431
「倫敦鐵橋垮下來」
"London Bridge is falling down

211
00:35:03,573 --> 00:35:08,427
「垮下來，垮下來」
"Falling down, falling down"

212
00:35:10,407 --> 00:35:12,348
「美麗小姐」
"My fair lady"

213
00:35:24,109 --> 00:35:25,742
他起得來嗎？
Is he up? Is he?

214
00:35:32,821 --> 00:35:35,459
真是一場惡夢
What a horrible nightmare.

215
00:35:37,143 --> 00:35:38,581
等等
Wait a minute.

216
00:35:38,785 --> 00:35:40,784
噢，天！
Oh, God!

217
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,471
我不能動！
I can't move!

218
00:35:56,306 --> 00:35:57,710
張開嘴！
Open wide!

219
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,187
走！
Let's go!

220
00:36:01,734 --> 00:36:04,738
萬歲！
Geronimo!

221
00:36:10,813 --> 00:36:12,080
走！
Let's go!

222
00:36:35,336 --> 00:36:39,722
好，小家夥，來點熱巧克力吧？
Okay, little fella.
How about some hot chocolate?

223
00:36:50,412 --> 00:36:54,627
嘗到厲害了吧？知道了吧...
How'd you like the taste of that?
How'd you like the taste...

224
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:15,094
天啊！越來越大！
Dear God! It's growing bigger!

225
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,348
-嘿
-嘿
. Hey!
. Hey!

226
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:41,801
-這是怎麼--
-這是怎麼--
. What's the big idea<i>...</i>
. What's the big idea<i>...</i>

227
00:37:41,872 --> 00:37:43,402
-嘿，你-
-嘿，你-
. Why, you<i>...</i>
. Why, you<i>...</i>

228
00:37:48,103 --> 00:37:49,907
我瞎了，我瞎了
I'm blind. I'm blind.

229
00:38:00,498 --> 00:38:02,405
你帶我去哪？
Where are you taking me?

230
00:38:02,743 --> 00:38:06,489
「噢，蘇珊娜，請別為我哭泣」
"Oh, Susanna, don't you cry for me

231
00:38:06,562 --> 00:38:10,879
「我來自阿拉巴馬帶著斑鳩遊四方」
"'Cause I come from Alabama
with a banjo on my knee"

232
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:26,091
你是什麼東西？
What are you?

233
00:38:26,797 --> 00:38:28,133
你是我？
Are you me?

234
00:38:28,338 --> 00:38:30,405
「你是什麼？你是我？」
"What are you? Are you me?"

235
00:38:32,426 --> 00:38:34,996
-你聽起來像個混蛋！
-你為什麼這樣？
. You sound like a jerk!
. Why are you doing this?

236
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:38,314
你想知道？因為答案很簡單
You want to know?
Because the answer's easy.

237
00:38:38,925 --> 00:38:42,500
我是壞阿希，你是好阿希
I'm bad Ash. And you're good Ash.

238
00:38:42,744 --> 00:38:46,250
你是個乖寶寶
你是個乖寶寶
You're goody little two. Shoes.
You're goody little two. Shoes.

239
00:39:15,877 --> 00:39:17,544
我沒那麼乖
I ain't that good.

240
00:40:23,057 --> 00:40:25,032
現在你知道我厲害了
Now you see what's what.

241
00:40:26,576 --> 00:40:29,420
這身體可是我的
A man's body is his own personal property.

242
00:40:30,897 --> 00:40:34,106
沒人能將之奪走
Don't let anybody try
and take that away from him.

243
00:40:35,822 --> 00:40:39,671
給你個教訓
That'll teach you. Yeah. That'll teach you.

244
00:40:42,221 --> 00:40:44,893
你不可能拿到死亡志記
You shall never retrieve the Necronomicon.

245
00:40:45,035 --> 00:40:48,039
拿到書前你就會死在墓園裏
You'll die in the graveyard
before you get it.

246
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:51,829
嘿，你臉上有什麼東西？
Hey, what's that you got on your face?

247
00:40:54,783 --> 00:40:57,787
-懂了吧？
-我會回來算帳的
. See how that works?
. I'll come back for you.

248
00:41:17,062 --> 00:41:18,534
來！
Come on, boy!

249
00:41:33,512 --> 00:41:34,676
來！
Come on!

250
00:42:53,314 --> 00:42:54,410
三本？
Three books?

251
00:42:59,042 --> 00:43:01,143
等等，等等
Wait a minute. Hold it.

252
00:43:01,588 --> 00:43:04,934
沒人說過會有三本書
Nobody said anything about three books.

253
00:43:05,776 --> 00:43:07,546
那個臭智者！
That stinking Wiseman!

254
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:10,460
光顧著要我講密語...
He was so busy filling me
with his secret words...

255
00:43:10,534 --> 00:43:14,817
...跟一大堆屁話
他可沒提到會有三本書
...and his phrases, and his bullshit,
that he never said anything about this.

256
00:43:16,564 --> 00:43:21,486
我該怎麼辦？
拿一本，三本還是怎樣？
Like what am I supposed to do?
Take one book, or all books, or what?

257
00:44:27,487 --> 00:44:28,823
不是這本
Wrong book.

258
00:45:22,397 --> 00:45:23,927
滾！
Get outta here!

259
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,223
我回頭再來找你
I'll get back to you.

260
00:45:38,076 --> 00:45:39,308
呃...
Well...

261
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:43,226
...很明顯了
...it seems fairly obvious.

262
00:45:47,791 --> 00:45:50,795
等等，密語，對了
Wait a minute. The words. Right.

263
00:45:51,879 --> 00:45:53,751
說密語
Say the words.

264
00:45:57,306 --> 00:45:58,573
卡拉吐...
Klaatu...

265
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:00,754
...巴拉他...
...barada...

266
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:10,227
尼克泰
Necktie.

267
00:46:10,807 --> 00:46:11,903
尼克塔
Nectar.

268
00:46:12,382 --> 00:46:13,546
尼克爾
Nickel.

269
00:46:14,392 --> 00:46:18,641
奴斗爾，是「N」開頭的沒錯
確定是「N」開頭的
Noodle. It's an "N" word.
It's definitely an "N" word.

270
00:46:22,265 --> 00:46:24,137
確定是「N」開頭的
Definitely an "N" word!

271
00:46:35,934 --> 00:46:38,709
卡拉吐，    巴拉他...
Klaatu, barada...

272
00:46:54,862 --> 00:46:56,164
好囉
Okay, then.

273
00:47:06,107 --> 00:47:08,745
嘿！等等
Hey! Wait a minute.

274
00:47:09,289 --> 00:47:13,070
別找麻煩，我說密語了，我說了！
Everything's cool. I said the word. I did!

275
00:47:15,386 --> 00:47:16,882
不！等等！
No! Wait!

276
00:47:22,523 --> 00:47:23,551
不！
No!

277
00:47:31,635 --> 00:47:34,844
你們大家快找庇護！
You, people, seek cover! To the parapet!

278
00:47:36,058 --> 00:47:37,794
把小孩找齊
Seek your children.

279
00:47:39,709 --> 00:47:41,376
穩住馬匹！
Steady the horses!

280
00:47:41,987 --> 00:47:44,591
出事了，出事了
Something's wrong. Something's amiss.

281
00:48:18,068 --> 00:48:19,598
你上哪去？
Where'd you go?

282
00:48:55,591 --> 00:48:58,903
我會打扁你們！
打得你們稀巴爛，臭骨頭！
I'll crush you!
I'll mash your faces, you bony creatures!

283
00:49:08,255 --> 00:49:11,796
別把你的肮髒骨頭伸到我嘴裏
Keep your damn, filthy bones
out of my mouth.

284
00:49:29,495 --> 00:49:30,693
來！
Come on!

285
00:49:36,497 --> 00:49:41,454
我不當清道夫了
我達成承諾，現在我要回去了
I'm through being their garbage boy.
I did my part. Now I want back.

286
00:49:41,723 --> 00:49:43,356
一切按照約定行事
Like in the deal.

287
00:49:57,804 --> 00:49:59,608
我...
I...

288
00:49:59,814 --> 00:50:01,481
...重...
...live...

289
00:50:03,064 --> 00:50:05,473
...生！
...again!

290
00:50:15,158 --> 00:50:19,109
那邊！上天使者！
上天使者回來了！
There! The promised one!
The promised one's returned!

291
00:50:19,514 --> 00:50:21,683
拉開鐵門！
Raise the portcullis!

292
00:50:34,522 --> 00:50:39,068
他真是上天的使者！
他帶回死亡志記了
Truly, he is the promised one!
He's brought the Necronomicon.

293
00:50:39,179 --> 00:50:41,120
-嗨
-他拿到書了
. Hi.
. He's got the book!

294
00:50:41,189 --> 00:50:42,593
是，對
Yeah, great.

295
00:50:43,433 --> 00:50:45,568
滾遠一點
Get the fuck out of my face.

296
00:50:51,742 --> 00:50:55,557
死亡志記，快
拿到死亡志記了嗎？
The Necronomicon, quickly.
Did you bring the Necronomicon?

297
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,238
-有，但是-
-但是什麼？
. Yeah, it's just that<i>...</i>
. Just what?

298
00:51:00,687 --> 00:51:03,062
沒事，拿去
Nothing. Here.

299
00:51:09,732 --> 00:51:12,267
送我回去吧，我們說好的
Now send me back. Like in the deal.

300
00:51:12,747 --> 00:51:17,327
當你拿起書時，你念了密語嗎？
When you removed the Necronomicon
from the cradle, did you speak the words?

301
00:51:17,672 --> 00:51:20,744
-嗯，大致上有
-你念的密語無誤嗎？
. Yeah, basically.
. Did you speak the exact words?

302
00:51:20,822 --> 00:51:23,803
也許我沒有一個字一個字的發音...
Look, maybe I didn't say every single,
little tiny syllable...

303
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:26,679
-但大致上，我念了密語
-你這可恨的傻子！
...but basically, I said 'em.
. Dung. eating fool!

304
00:51:26,752 --> 00:51:28,693
你害慘我們了
Thou hast doomed us all.

305
00:51:28,828 --> 00:51:32,403
只為你念錯密語
死亡軍團因此蘇醒了
When thou misspoke the words,
the army of the dead awoke.

306
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:34,716
喂，慢著，菠菜下巴
Now, whoa, right there, spinach. Chin.

307
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:37,872
你說只要拿到書就能料理一切
You said you could clean this mess up
once you got that book.

308
00:51:37,941 --> 00:51:41,950
還說書裏有段話能讓我重返我的時空
That there's a passage in there that could
get rid of this thing and send me back.

309
00:51:42,062 --> 00:51:45,237
沒錯，這本書還是有能力送你回去
It's true, the book still possesses
the power to send you back.

310
00:51:45,345 --> 00:51:49,662
但對我們來說，一切都完了！
邪惡死者會瘋狂搶奪死亡志記
But to us, it is useless! The evil has
a terrible hunger for the Necronomicon.

311
00:51:49,734 --> 00:51:52,143
他們會找來這裏！
And it will come here to get it!

312
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:54,388
我們說好的
We had a deal.

313
00:51:55,027 --> 00:51:57,802
你要這本書，我幫你拿來了！
You wanted the damn book,
I got it for you!

314
00:51:57,875 --> 00:52:00,078
我盡了本份，你該送我回去！
I did my part, now you send me back!

315
00:52:00,153 --> 00:52:01,351
好
Very well.

316
00:52:01,561 --> 00:52:05,741
我們言而有信
會依照協定行事
As we are men of our word,
we shall honor our bargain.

317
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:09,924
智者會將你送回你的時空
The Wiseman shall return you
to your own time.

318
00:52:10,807 --> 00:52:11,903
噢？
Yeah?

319
00:52:13,353 --> 00:52:14,791
我以為他是上天使者
I thought he was the one.

320
00:52:14,893 --> 00:52:18,365
對，因為我們說好了
Yeah, right, because that was the deal.

321
00:52:18,747 --> 00:52:23,201
我們什麼時候可以...
So when do you think we can start
with all the thing and the...

322
00:52:23,269 --> 00:52:25,210
他是個叛徒，叛徒！
He's nothing but a traitor, he is!

323
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:30,367
我們什麼時候可以開始...
When do you think we can start
with all the ceremony and the...

324
00:52:31,176 --> 00:52:34,385
...你知道的，我是想，因為...
...you know, like, you know, because...

325
00:52:34,961 --> 00:52:37,770
...打鐵趁熱嘛，對吧？
...sooner's always better than later, right?

326
00:52:38,177 --> 00:52:43,431
-你真是男人的恥辱
-智者真是傻瓜才相信了你
. Wretched excuse for a man.
. The Wisemen were fools to trust in you.

327
00:52:44,945 --> 00:52:48,794
-我知道他不值得信任
-我還真信任過他
. I knew he couldn't be trusted.
. I trusted him.

328
00:52:50,272 --> 00:52:52,910
我依然相信你能幫助我們
I still believe that thou wilt help us.

329
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:56,535
席拉，你還不懂？結束了
Sheila. Don't you get it? It's over.

330
00:52:58,279 --> 00:53:00,380
我沒有那個能力
I didn't have what it took.

331
00:53:02,667 --> 00:53:03,899
再見
So long.

332
00:53:09,301 --> 00:53:10,797
你會離開我？
You would leave me?

333
00:53:11,311 --> 00:53:14,052
天，我不屬於這裏
Cripes, I don't belong here.

334
00:53:15,499 --> 00:53:17,874
我有回去的機會，我不會放過
I got a chance to go back, and I'm taking it.

335
00:53:18,045 --> 00:53:20,284
但我們共享的一段呢？
But what of the things that we've shared?

336
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:23,839
你私下對我說的甜言蜜語呢？
What of all the sweet words
that you spoke in private?

337
00:53:25,884 --> 00:53:29,835
那只是所謂的枕邊細語，寶貝
沒什麼大意義的
Well, that's just what we call pillow talk,
baby. That's all.

338
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,112
不僅是這樣！
It was more than that!

339
00:53:33,992 --> 00:53:36,093
我仍相信你
I still have faith in thee.

340
00:53:36,739 --> 00:53:39,983
我仍相信你會留下來幫我們
I still believe that thou wilt stay
and save us.

341
00:53:45,717 --> 00:53:46,710
懦夫
Coward.

342
00:54:10,308 --> 00:54:13,289
-救我！
-席拉！
. Help me!
. Sheila!

343
00:54:27,092 --> 00:54:29,570
別放箭！你會傷了她
Hold your arms! You'll hit the girl.

344
00:54:34,698 --> 00:54:35,965
拿劍來
My sword.

345
00:54:41,063 --> 00:54:42,330
可惡！
Damn you!

346
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:02,636
挖，用力挖！
Dig, damn you!

347
00:55:03,945 --> 00:55:05,783
挖快點！
Dig faster!

348
00:55:06,055 --> 00:55:09,801
我將統領所有在戰斗中死去
滿身爬滿螻蟻的鬼東西
I shall command every worm. Infested
son of a bitch that ever died in battle.

349
00:55:09,875 --> 00:55:11,439
-謝謝您
-你！
. Thank you, sir.
. You there!

350
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,149
很好！
Handsomely, now!

351
00:55:13,259 --> 00:55:16,068
我們去攻擊他們的城堡
拿回我的書
We shall storm their castle
and get my book.

352
00:55:16,474 --> 00:55:18,473
起來，你們這些惡棍
Hoist, you damnable varlets!

353
00:55:23,375 --> 00:55:26,619
歡迎回到活人的地盤
Welcome back to the land of the living.

354
00:55:27,329 --> 00:55:29,933
拿起鏟子來快挖！
Now pick up a shovel and get digging!

355
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,821
把女人帶來！
Bring on the wench!

356
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:35,961
下去！
Get down there!

357
00:55:45,855 --> 00:55:47,762
給我一個吻，寶貝
Give me some sugar, baby.

358
00:55:53,963 --> 00:55:57,744
你真是可愛啊？
Now ain't you the sweet little thing?

359
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:03,977
別碰我，你這惡心的東西！
Don't touch me, you foul thing!

360
00:56:10,486 --> 00:56:13,695
來，乖
Come on. That's it.

361
00:56:27,672 --> 00:56:30,413
你要派上用場囉，快走！
We got plans for you, girly. Girl! Move!

362
00:56:32,228 --> 00:56:35,700
快拼命挖，快點！
Bust your bones, you dig up holes, dogs!
Get thee hence!

363
00:56:45,663 --> 00:56:47,399
有探子來報！
A scout approaches!

364
00:56:54,674 --> 00:56:56,170
牽著馬
Get his horse!

365
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,250
起來
Arise.

366
00:56:58,326 --> 00:57:02,141
陛下，死亡軍團在野地上聚集
正朝著城堡過來
My Lord, an army of the dead gather
in the wilderness and approach the castle.

367
00:57:02,212 --> 00:57:04,655
-多遠？
-才兩天的路程
. How far from here?
. But two days ride.

368
00:57:04,792 --> 00:57:08,538
-有翅膀的是前鋒
-也許我們該快逃
. These winged ones are only the first.
. Perhaps we should leave soon.

369
00:57:08,611 --> 00:57:11,249
-到山中可保安全
-是，我們快逃！
. We'll be safe in the mountains.
. Yes. We must flee!

370
00:57:11,358 --> 00:57:14,396
-書上已記載了，這是注定的
-他們會奪走我們的靈魂
. It is written. It's been foretold.
. They'll take our souls.

371
00:57:14,508 --> 00:57:16,483
-我怕！
-所有人的靈魂！
. I'm afraid!
. Every one of our souls!

372
00:57:16,551 --> 00:57:18,218
我不想死
I don't want to die.

373
00:57:19,198 --> 00:57:23,173
好啊！快逃啊！
That's it! Go ahead and run!

374
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:27,900
逃回家去跟媽媽哭啊！我？
Run home and cry to mama! Me?

375
00:57:29,382 --> 00:57:31,152
我不願再逃了！
I'm through running!

376
00:57:33,302 --> 00:57:35,837
我說我們留下來跟他們拼命
I say we stay here and fight it out.

377
00:57:36,384 --> 00:57:40,530
未來的人都跟你一樣會說大話嗎？
Are all men from the future
loudmouth braggarts?

378
00:57:40,941 --> 00:57:43,819
不，只有我才這樣
No. Just me, baby.

379
00:57:44,525 --> 00:57:45,495
只有我
Just me.

380
00:57:46,636 --> 00:57:50,108
我們如何在城堡牆邊抵抗死亡軍團？
How will we fight an army of the dead
at our castle walls?

381
00:57:50,488 --> 00:57:55,342
怎麼跟他們拼命？用說的嗎？
大部分的人都逃走了
How will you fight that? More words?
Most of our people have already fled.

382
00:57:55,581 --> 00:57:57,522
這裏只剩60個人
We are but 60 men.

383
00:57:58,731 --> 00:58:02,374
我們可以找紅衣亨利的人來幫忙
Then we'll get Henry the Red
and his men to fight with us.

384
00:58:04,995 --> 00:58:09,038
誰願意加入？
Now! Who's with me?

385
00:58:23,321 --> 00:58:25,125
我跟隨你
I'll stand by you.

386
00:58:27,374 --> 00:58:31,589
-我願意效力
-我會獻出勇氣！
. You can count on my steel.
. I'll offer up my courage!

387
00:58:31,931 --> 00:58:35,140
-我與你共進退！
-我站在你這邊！
. Me sword's by your side!
. I'm with you!

388
00:58:35,716 --> 00:58:37,749
我為你效力
I'll bend my bow to your will, sir.

389
00:58:42,149 --> 00:58:45,324
萬歲！萬歲！萬歲！
Hail! Hail! Hail!

390
00:59:02,216 --> 00:59:06,225
親愛的，跟大夥打個招呼
Well, my dear, say hello to the boys.

391
00:59:12,803 --> 00:59:15,281
很久沒見這麼美的人了
There's a sight for sore bones.

392
00:59:19,738 --> 00:59:24,456
我壞到骨頭裏了
I may be bad, but I feel good.

393
00:59:26,371 --> 00:59:29,009
-誰是統領？
-您，陛下
. Who rules?
. It is you, my lord.

394
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:30,615
向城堡前進！
To the castle!

395
00:59:33,407 --> 00:59:35,245
-但大家都怕！
-太重了！夠了
. But the men are afraid!
. It's too heavy! Now, that's enough.

396
00:59:35,317 --> 00:59:37,486
別抱怨了！
Quit your bellyaching!

397
00:59:38,566 --> 00:59:42,746
我知道你們怕，我們都怕
I know you're scared. We're all scared.

398
00:59:44,262 --> 00:59:46,763
但這不表示我們怯懦
But that doesn't mean we're cowards.

399
00:59:47,444 --> 00:59:50,356
我們能打敗他們，一定能！
We can take these Deadites,
we can take them!

400
00:59:52,034 --> 00:59:53,438
運用科學
With science.

401
00:59:57,629 --> 00:59:59,501
快，快！
Hurry up, now!

402
01:00:00,208 --> 01:00:02,651
快！推，一起來！
Come on, fellas! Push! Heave ho!

403
01:00:16,457 --> 01:00:18,626
基礎化學

404
01:00:22,186 --> 01:00:23,990
蒸氣廠運作

405
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:56,187
傾斜，傾斜
Tilt. Tilt.

406
01:00:57,564 --> 01:00:59,002
好，來，來
Okay, in, in.

407
01:01:08,217 --> 01:01:09,621
火藥

408
01:01:45,002 --> 01:01:48,543
來了！死亡軍團來了！
They're coming! The Deadites approach!

409
01:01:54,181 --> 01:01:57,630
快，你這些沒用的人！
他們就要到了！
Quickly now, you worthless fools!
They'll be on us anon!

410
01:01:57,767 --> 01:01:59,239
快！
Come on, guys!

411
01:02:03,529 --> 01:02:07,675
就要見真章了
你們最好別讓我失望
The moment of truth is almost here.
You men better not fail me now.

412
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:26,369
他們聲勢如此浩大
There's so damned many of them.

413
01:02:39,879 --> 01:02:41,477
我需要多一點人手
I need more men.

414
01:03:24,636 --> 01:03:28,611
戰壘！堆起石頭！快！
Battle stations! Get those rocks up!
On the double!

415
01:03:28,992 --> 01:03:33,104
准備好彈弓！
讓他們知道我們的厲害！
Ready the catapults!
By God, let's give them what for!

416
01:03:42,829 --> 01:03:43,925
停！
Halt!

417
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:51,532
-望遠鏡！
-遵命
. Looking glass!
. Aye, sire.

418
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:01,823
拿到死亡志記後...
Once I possess the Necronomicon...

419
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:08,080
...我會統治一切，你就是我的皇後
...I shall rule, and you shall be my queen.

420
01:05:22,564 --> 01:05:25,510
陛下，我們已經兩面都布置好了
My lord, we are positioned on both fronts.

421
01:05:25,579 --> 01:05:28,959
好，他們把我的書放哪裏？
Fine. Where are they keeping my book?

422
01:05:29,331 --> 01:05:32,209
那裏，陛下
在第二層牆的吊橋後面
There, my lord.
Beyond the drawbridge in the second wall.

423
01:05:32,279 --> 01:05:34,312
那是最安全的地方
That would be the safest place.

424
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:39,108
沒有人能阻撓我取得死亡志記
I will not allow anything to keep me
from possessing that Necronomicon.

425
01:05:40,923 --> 01:05:45,172
現在，向城堡邁進
Now, bring me forth into that castle.

426
01:05:45,546 --> 01:05:48,755
-前進！
-前進！

427
01:05:48,896 --> 01:05:52,711
大肆破壞，放出戰狗！

436
01:07:12,551 --> 01:07:13,749
穩住
Steady.

437
01:07:20,759 --> 01:07:21,855
發射！
Fire!

438
01:07:24,578 --> 01:07:27,284
前進，邪魔！前進！
Advance, you demons! Advance!

439
01:07:48,598 --> 01:07:51,510
對啦，寶貝！
Yeah, baby!

440
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:00,119
好！
All right!

441
01:08:01,295 --> 01:08:04,001
-撤退！
-快逃啊！
. Retreat!
. Let's get the hell out of here!

442
01:08:14,295 --> 01:08:15,562
他真可惡！
Damn him!

443
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:19,214
側面的第二突擊隊會成功的
The sortie on the second flank will stand.

444
01:08:19,386 --> 01:08:20,916
一定得成功！
It must!

445
01:08:22,301 --> 01:08:26,012
長官，南面有第二波的攻擊
Sire, there's a second division
approaching from the south.

446
01:08:26,657 --> 01:08:29,329
沖進城門！
Ram the gates!

447
01:08:33,725 --> 01:08:35,061
彈弓手！
Catapults!

448
01:08:35,502 --> 01:08:37,637
彈弓手！南面！
Catapults! South!

449
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:48,463
-我們會擊敗他們！
-再度攻擊！
. We'll crush them!
. We'll strike again!

450
01:09:00,896 --> 01:09:02,392
發射！
Fire!

451
01:09:10,042 --> 01:09:11,344
哪來的火？
What the blazes?

452
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:21,488
-小心！
-讓開！
. Watch out!
. Make way!

453
01:09:28,401 --> 01:09:29,771
快躲起來！
Seek cover!

454
01:09:39,389 --> 01:09:42,198
你們這些爛骨頭！
You miserable bags of bones!

455
01:09:42,372 --> 01:09:45,981
快爬起來再...
Pick yourselves up and sally for...

456
01:09:47,162 --> 01:09:48,498
再...
Sally for...

457
01:09:49,741 --> 01:09:51,740
再沖
Sally forth.

458
01:09:55,538 --> 01:09:57,845
快，你們這些沒用的東西！
Come on, you miserable wretches!

459
01:10:08,536 --> 01:10:09,632
前進！
Forward!

460
01:10:12,389 --> 01:10:14,890
鞏固城門！快！
Buttress that door! Now!

461
01:10:31,921 --> 01:10:33,085
石塊！
Rocks!

462
01:10:34,332 --> 01:10:35,496
可惡！
Damn you!

463
01:10:39,257 --> 01:10:41,358
一定很痛！
That's gotta hurt!

464
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:43,140
混帳東西！
You cretins!

465
01:10:43,478 --> 01:10:44,676
箭！
Arrows!

466
01:10:45,891 --> 01:10:46,884
發射！
Fire!

467
01:10:52,357 --> 01:10:55,029
我們要讓那混帳好看！
We'll ram it down the bastard's throat!

468
01:10:56,478 --> 01:10:57,540
發射！
Fire!

469
01:11:03,044 --> 01:11:05,682
南面側攻隊，到西牆去！快！
South flank, to the western wall! Now!

470
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:09,903
紅衣亨利呢？早告訴你他不會來！
Where is Henry the Red?
I told you he would not come!

471
01:11:09,978 --> 01:11:14,798
戴好你的罐頭帽子，鐵頭！
我說他會來，他就是會來！
Keep your sardine can on, bucket. Head!
I said he'll be here, he'll be here!

472
01:11:15,205 --> 01:11:17,911
我不認為，但我要告訴你
I think he will not. But know this.

473
01:11:18,321 --> 01:11:23,175
無論戰役結果如何
認為你是懦夫是我的錯
No matter how this battle fares,
I was wrong to think you a coward.

474
01:11:28,974 --> 01:11:31,783
沖破了！城陷了！
We've broken through! The castle is ours!

475
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:39,452
殺光活人！
Kill the mortals!

476
01:11:44,217 --> 01:11:45,747
好了！
All right, men!

477
01:12:15,944 --> 01:12:19,290
他們沖破了第一道牆！
接下來怎麼辦？
They've breached the first wall!
What next?

478
01:12:26,296 --> 01:12:28,739
我們被遺棄了！
We are deserted!

479
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:32,315
向後退！守衛城牆！
Fall back! Man the parapet!

480
01:12:32,728 --> 01:12:34,326
保護死亡志記！
Protect the book!

481
01:12:35,676 --> 01:12:37,240
願神救助
God save us all.

482
01:12:38,156 --> 01:12:42,039
爬上樓梯，小子！
到安全的牆後去！
Up the ladders, lads!
To the safety of the parapets!

483
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:54,367
與21世紀打個招呼
Say hello to the 21st century.

484
01:13:07,538 --> 01:13:10,108
來！人人有份！
Come on! I got plenty for everybody!

485
01:13:19,097 --> 01:13:21,701
-滋味不錯吧？
-裝死！
. How do you like this?
. Play dead!

486
01:13:24,456 --> 01:13:26,865
抓住車上的人！
It's the one in the cart we want. Get him!

487
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:47,093
再見啦，蠢蛋！
<i>Sayonara</i>, sucker!

488
01:13:53,737 --> 01:13:54,901
你...
Why, you...

489
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:59,398
你逃不出我的手掌心！
You can run, but you can't hide!

490
01:14:25,799 --> 01:14:26,997
席拉？
Sheila?

491
01:14:52,399 --> 01:14:54,900
-我們已拿下庭院了，陛下
-很好
. We've secured the courtyard, my lord.
. Excellent.

492
01:14:55,783 --> 01:14:58,558
該是拿書的時候了，把牆撞破！
Now I will have that book.
Storm the walls!

493
01:14:59,032 --> 01:15:00,128
樓梯！
Ladders!

494
01:15:00,205 --> 01:15:04,088
來，你們這些死人骨頭！快！
不然我送你們進沾膠廠！
Come on, you bony devils! Hurry up!
Or I'll send you to the glue factory!

495
01:15:04,158 --> 01:15:05,322
強力膠！
Elmer!

496
01:15:06,135 --> 01:15:07,607
往牆進攻！
To the walls!

497
01:15:10,892 --> 01:15:13,496
我把你切成一片片的！不，不！
I'll slice you to ribbons! No, no!

498
01:15:38,330 --> 01:15:40,066
慢著！小心！
Wait! Look out!

499
01:15:47,610 --> 01:15:50,785
-嘿，你是我的人，甜心！
-走開！
. Hey, you're mine, sweetie!
. Get off of her!

500
01:15:57,996 --> 01:15:59,263
可惡！
Damn you!

501
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:04,552
守護死亡志記，小子們！
否則就死在惡魔的火裏
Defend the Necronomicon, lads!
Or perish in the devil's fire!

502
01:16:09,253 --> 01:16:11,959
-陛下
-看好志記！
. My lord.
. Stay with the book!

503
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:14,039
志記會是我們的！
The book will be ours!

504
01:16:36,590 --> 01:16:37,618
嗨！
Hello!

505
01:16:48,182 --> 01:16:49,815
這書是我的！
The book is mine!

506
01:16:54,413 --> 01:16:55,885
拿去！
There you go!

507
01:17:04,263 --> 01:17:06,262
我把你剁個稀巴爛
I'll cut your gizzard out.

508
01:17:07,278 --> 01:17:08,750
去哪了？
Where'd he go?

509
01:17:19,942 --> 01:17:21,414
來吧！
Come to Papa!

去抓他！
Get him!

511
01:17:54,147 --> 01:17:58,533
瘋女人，走開！
你要把我眼睛挖出來了！
Crazy bitch, get off me!
You're tearing my eyes out!

512
01:17:59,809 --> 01:18:01,145
妖女！
You witch!

513
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:09,020
對
Right.

514
01:18:16,627 --> 01:18:18,762
你以前認為我很美的
You found me beautiful once.

515
01:18:19,441 --> 01:18:21,976
蜜糖，你變成醜八怪了
Honey, you got real ugly.

516
01:18:41,418 --> 01:18:42,982
在這
There we are.

517
01:18:51,937 --> 01:18:53,775
你要來狠的？
You wanna play rough?

518
01:19:05,171 --> 01:19:06,403
好！
All right!

519
01:19:29,896 --> 01:19:31,563
你慘了！
You're going down!

520
01:19:32,676 --> 01:19:35,177
-我往上走！
-我追你到底！
. I'm going up!
. I'm coming for you!

521
01:20:06,714 --> 01:20:07,844
抓他！
Get him!

522
01:20:10,299 --> 01:20:11,463
借過！
Excuse me!

523
01:20:11,605 --> 01:20:13,443
來！對！
Come on! All right!

524
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:19,133
你激怒我的，你這醜八怪！
You're pissin' me off,
you ugly son of a bitch!

525
01:20:21,891 --> 01:20:22,884
不！
No!

526
01:20:41,422 --> 01:20:44,300
我要把你毀容了！
I'll spoil those good looks!

527
01:20:47,419 --> 01:20:48,891
暗箭傷人！
Backstabber!

528
01:20:54,454 --> 01:20:55,824
別動！
Hold still!

529
01:21:10,837 --> 01:21:12,904
來囉！
Tallyho!

530
01:21:20,385 --> 01:21:25,171
-我們守不下去了！
-一定要守！要保護志記！
. We can't hold the battlements!
. We will hold! We must protect the book!

531
01:21:25,444 --> 01:21:28,048
紅衣亨利呢？他怎麼還...
Where's Henry the Red? Why's he not...

532
01:21:29,833 --> 01:21:32,276
我們被遺棄了！
We are deserted!

533
01:21:33,685 --> 01:21:35,352
我們勢力薄弱！
We're overwhelmed!

534
01:21:57,606 --> 01:21:59,845
我要跟你沒完沒了
I got a bone to pick with you.

535
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:01,718
來！
