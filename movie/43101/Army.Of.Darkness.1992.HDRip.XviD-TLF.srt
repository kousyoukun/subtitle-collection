1
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,898
My name is Ash,
and I am a slave.

2
00:00:29,107 --> 00:00:31,901
- Aah !

3
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,737
Close as I can figure it,
the year is 1300 A.D.,

4
00:00:34,946 --> 00:00:37,365
and I'm being
dragged to my death.

5
00:00:37,574 --> 00:00:40,201
It wasn't always
like this.

6
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,122
I had
a real life once.

7
00:00:44,621 --> 00:00:46,540
A job.

8
00:00:46,748 --> 00:00:51,503
Ash to price check four.

9
00:00:51,753 --> 00:00:54,089
Um, hardware, aisle 12.

10
00:00:54,298 --> 00:00:56,258
Shop smart.
Shop S-mart.

11
00:00:56,466 --> 00:01:01,138
I had a wonderful
girlfriend, Linda.

12
00:01:02,723 --> 00:01:07,269
Together, we drove to
a small cabin in the mountains.

13
00:01:10,063 --> 00:01:12,774
It seems an archaeologist
had come to this remote place...

14
00:01:12,983 --> 00:01:15,777
to translate and study
his latest find,

15
00:01:15,986 --> 00:01:19,114
"Necronomicon Ex Mortis,"

16
00:01:19,323 --> 00:01:23,243
"The Book of the Dead."

17
00:01:23,493 --> 00:01:26,914
Bound in human flesh
and inked in blood,

18
00:01:27,122 --> 00:01:31,460
this ancient Sumerian text
contained bizarre burial rites,

19
00:01:31,668 --> 00:01:36,715
funerary incantations
and demon resurrection passages.

20
00:01:36,924 --> 00:01:39,843
It was never meant
for the world of the living.

21
00:01:40,052 --> 00:01:45,182
The book awoke
something dark in the woods.

22
00:01:50,646 --> 00:01:52,648
It took Linda.

23
00:01:52,856 --> 00:01:55,692
- And then it came for me.

24
00:01:55,901 --> 00:01:58,862
It got into my hand
and it went bad.

25
00:01:59,071 --> 00:02:01,490
So I lopped it off
at the wrist.

26
00:02:07,746 --> 00:02:10,374
But that didn't stop it.
It came back.

27
00:02:10,582 --> 00:02:14,169
- Big time.

28
00:02:14,378 --> 00:02:16,838
Ah !

29
00:02:17,047 --> 00:02:20,592
Aah !

30
00:02:29,726 --> 00:02:33,020
My God !

31
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:35,064
How do you stop it ?

32
00:03:31,787 --> 00:03:33,873
- Surround the stranger !

33
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,712
All right,
you men, fall in !

34
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,594
All o' ya, keep a pace !

35
00:03:46,802 --> 00:03:49,847
Where in the hell--

36
00:03:56,771 --> 00:03:58,814
Stand fast, hellhound !

37
00:03:59,023 --> 00:04:02,318
No, no.
Easy now, chief.

38
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:04,278
Uh, I don't know
how I got here,

39
00:04:04,487 --> 00:04:08,783
- and, uh, uh, I'm not
looking for any trouble.

40
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,248
What a piece of armor this is !

41
00:04:15,498 --> 00:04:17,917
- Wise man !
- Fall back ! Come on, all you men.

42
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,503
Back on your horses.
Come on !

43
00:04:22,212 --> 00:04:25,924
My lord, I believe he is the one
written of in the Necronomicon.

44
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,426
He who's prophesied to fall
from the heavens...

45
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:31,429
and deliver us from
the terrors of the Deadites.

46
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,223
What, that buffoon ?

47
00:04:33,431 --> 00:04:35,767
Likely...

48
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,811
he's one
of Henry's men !

49
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:41,940
- Kneel, rapscallions !

50
00:04:42,107 --> 00:04:44,818
I say
to the pit with him !

51
00:04:45,026 --> 00:04:48,989
You shall soon
learn the horrors of the pit.

52
00:04:49,197 --> 00:04:52,534
- To the pit !
- You miserable bast--

53
00:04:52,742 --> 00:04:57,789
- Get him !
- Get off of me !

54
00:04:58,415 --> 00:05:01,209
- Let me go !
- Chain him !

55
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,839
Ah, you're gonna have
a little bit of wee fun, mate.

56
00:05:08,216 --> 00:05:11,803
To the castle !

57
00:05:13,054 --> 00:05:15,974
Pick up your feet !
Stop draggin' your feet !

58
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,310
Come on !
Move along !

59
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,478
Come on, now.

60
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,523
Come on, pick it up.
Have a taste of this !

61
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,742
You men got something
to look forward to...

62
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,454
when you get back to the castle.

63
00:05:37,662 --> 00:05:39,456
Lord Arthur approaches !

64
00:05:39,664 --> 00:05:42,542
Raise the portcullis !

65
00:05:42,751 --> 00:05:48,882
Lord Arthur !
Lord Arthur approaches !

66
00:05:52,594 --> 00:05:54,721
That's lovely, isn't it ?
Move it in.

67
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,683
Move it,
you worthless--

68
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:02,395
- Get on !

69
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:20,496
Move it up, boys.
God save the king !

70
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:23,457
God save the king.
We love him !

71
00:06:25,793 --> 00:06:29,046
Arthur !
He's back !

72
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:33,884
Lord Arthur, where is my brother ?
Did he not ride with you ?

73
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:36,053
Aye,
and fought valiantly.

74
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:39,640
But last night he fell in battle
to Duke Henry's men.

75
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:41,892
I'm sorry, Sheila.

76
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:43,769
Come on.

77
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:47,231
You cretin !
Ah, stop it, you bastard !

78
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:51,402
You barbarian !

79
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,446
- Oh, no ! Stop it ! Stop it !

80
00:06:54,655 --> 00:06:56,824
Get outta here,
you little brat !

81
00:07:00,661 --> 00:07:04,707
Foul thing !
A pox on you, brute !

82
00:07:04,915 --> 00:07:07,835
Thou art a murderer !
A black murderer !

83
00:07:13,048 --> 00:07:14,967
My brother's death
shall be avenged !

84
00:07:29,732 --> 00:07:33,360
Company, halt !

85
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:39,116
Get that yoke off 'im !

86
00:07:39,825 --> 00:07:42,453
Kill them !

87
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:44,538
Put them into the pit !

88
00:07:51,462 --> 00:07:55,590
You, sir,
are not one of my vassals.

89
00:07:55,798 --> 00:07:58,009
Who are you ?

90
00:07:58,218 --> 00:08:00,970
Who wants to know ?

91
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:03,139
I am Henry the Red,

92
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:07,685
Duke of Shael, Lord of the Northlands
and leader of its peoples.

93
00:08:07,894 --> 00:08:11,814
Well, hello,
Mr. Fancy Pants.

94
00:08:12,023 --> 00:08:14,859
I got news for you, pal. You ain't
leadin' but two things right now--

95
00:08:15,068 --> 00:08:17,904
Jack and shit,
and Jack left town.

96
00:08:18,112 --> 00:08:19,239
Shut your bleedin' hole !

97
00:08:19,447 --> 00:08:20,823
Shut your bleedin' hole !

98
00:08:21,032 --> 00:08:24,619
Gentlemen, Lord Arthur !

99
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,462
There is an evil
awakened in this land,

100
00:08:34,671 --> 00:08:38,216
and while my people fight
for their very souls against it,

101
00:08:38,424 --> 00:08:41,219
you, Henry the Red,
wage war on us !

102
00:08:41,427 --> 00:08:45,431
Charlatan !
Aah !

103
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,351
It was you who first turned
your swords on us !

104
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,437
And this evil has befouled
my people as well !

105
00:08:51,646 --> 00:08:54,440
Your people are no better
than the foul corruption...

106
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:56,568
that lies in the bowels of that pit.

107
00:08:56,776 --> 00:08:59,529
Right, you're no better.

108
00:08:59,737 --> 00:09:02,073
May God
have mercy upon your souls.

109
00:09:16,212 --> 00:09:21,551
God's name !
What hell-spawned thing lurks there ?

110
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:29,100
Into the pit with those
bloodthirsty sons of 'hores !

111
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:33,521
No ! No !

112
00:09:33,646 --> 00:09:36,566
No, no ! Aah !

113
00:10:03,383 --> 00:10:07,429
Oh ! Heavenly God !

114
00:10:09,348 --> 00:10:11,391
He's escaping !

115
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,270
- Hold to !
- Hold him !

116
00:10:45,384 --> 00:10:47,511
- Who's next ?
- It's him. Aye, he trembles !

117
00:10:47,719 --> 00:10:51,056
They don't look
so clever now, do they ?

118
00:10:51,265 --> 00:10:55,602
He's frightened !
He's frightened white !

119
00:10:55,811 --> 00:10:57,980
Whoa ! Whoa !

120
00:10:58,188 --> 00:11:00,941
Wait a minute. Hold it.

121
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:05,529
W-Wait a minute.
You gotta understand, man.

122
00:11:05,737 --> 00:11:08,198
I never even saw
these assholes before.

123
00:11:08,407 --> 00:11:10,367
- Get him in there !
- He trembles !

124
00:11:10,576 --> 00:11:12,494
He's begging !

125
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:15,163
- What are you waitin' for ?
- Henry !

126
00:11:15,372 --> 00:11:17,207
You gotta tell him
you don't know me.

127
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:21,628
We never met.
Tell him.

128
00:11:22,588 --> 00:11:26,383
I do not think
he'll listen, lad.

129
00:11:26,592 --> 00:11:27,718
Look.

130
00:11:27,925 --> 00:11:32,680
I'm tellin' you,
you got the wrong guy.

131
00:11:41,272 --> 00:11:45,359
I'm tellin' you,
you got the wrong guy.

132
00:11:45,568 --> 00:11:49,155
Uh, wh-whoa.

133
00:11:49,572 --> 00:11:51,699
- Aah !

134
00:12:40,665 --> 00:12:44,877
How do you like the pit ?
Isn't the pit wonderful ?

135
00:12:58,015 --> 00:13:00,101
- Hai-ya !

136
00:13:00,309 --> 00:13:04,230
- Why, you--

137
00:13:04,647 --> 00:13:06,983
Ha !

138
00:13:07,191 --> 00:13:09,026
Spikes.

139
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:13,698
Hey ! He says, "Spikes."
Give him spikes !

140
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:30,463
Make way !
Strange one !

141
00:13:39,848 --> 00:13:43,185
- Strange one !

142
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,565
Yaaah !

143
00:13:48,773 --> 00:13:52,652
Yes !

144
00:14:05,373 --> 00:14:08,585
Damn you.
Damn you !

145
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:37,214
You know,
your shoelace is untied.

146
00:15:46,724 --> 00:15:49,268
All right.

147
00:15:49,476 --> 00:15:52,188
Who wants some ?

148
00:15:52,396 --> 00:15:55,858
Who's next, huh ?

149
00:15:56,066 --> 00:15:57,943
How 'bout it ?

150
00:15:58,152 --> 00:16:00,529
Who wants some, huh ?

151
00:16:00,738 --> 00:16:04,617
Who wants
to have a little ?

152
00:16:06,994 --> 00:16:11,916
You.
You want some more ?

153
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:15,419
Huh ?

154
00:16:15,502 --> 00:16:19,173
You want a little ?

155
00:16:19,757 --> 00:16:22,468
Do ya ? Do ya ?
Do ya want some more?

156
00:16:22,676 --> 00:16:26,847
Huh ? Huh ?

157
00:16:39,193 --> 00:16:43,781
Now get on those horses
and get outta here.

158
00:16:45,866 --> 00:16:49,036
Let 'em go !

159
00:17:10,139 --> 00:17:12,892
- Halt !

160
00:17:13,101 --> 00:17:16,354
Thank you, generous hosts !

161
00:17:16,563 --> 00:17:19,983
Sword boy !

162
00:17:26,281 --> 00:17:31,369
For that arrogance,
I shall see you dead.

163
00:17:40,628 --> 00:17:42,547
Yeah.

164
00:17:42,755 --> 00:17:46,593
All right, you primitive screwheads,
listen up.

165
00:17:46,801 --> 00:17:48,970
See this ?

166
00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:53,850
- This is my boom stick !

167
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:56,394
It's a 12-gauge,
double-barreled Remington.

168
00:17:56,603 --> 00:17:58,479
S-mart's
top of the line.

169
00:17:58,688 --> 00:18:01,608
You can find this in
the sporting goods department.

170
00:18:01,816 --> 00:18:05,111
That's right. This sweet baby
was made in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

171
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,615
Retails for about $109.95.

172
00:18:08,823 --> 00:18:13,536
It's got a walnut stock,
cobalt blue steel and a hair trigger.

173
00:18:13,745 --> 00:18:17,040
That's right, shop smart.

174
00:18:17,248 --> 00:18:20,293
Shop S-mart.
You got that ?

175
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:22,295
- Yes, sir. Right.
- Yes, sir.

176
00:18:22,503 --> 00:18:24,506
Now I swear,

177
00:18:24,714 --> 00:18:27,800
the next one
of you primates...

178
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:31,679
even touches me--

179
00:18:58,372 --> 00:19:03,460
Now, let's talk about
how I get back home.

180
00:19:33,949 --> 00:19:36,493
I prithee to forgive me,
m'lord.

181
00:19:36,702 --> 00:19:39,371
I believed thee
one of Henry's men.

182
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,584
First you wanna kill me,
now you wanna kiss me.

183
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:46,169
Blow.

184
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,758
So what's the deal ?
Can you send me back or not ?

185
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:54,511
Only the Necronomicon
has the power.

186
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,847
An unholy book
which we also require.

187
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:00,642
Within its pages are passages
that can send you back to your time.

188
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:04,646
Only you, The Promised One,
can quest for it.

189
00:20:04,855 --> 00:20:08,108
I don't want your book.
I don't want your bullshit.

190
00:20:08,317 --> 00:20:13,530
Just send me back to my own time.
Pronto, today, chop--

191
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:24,498
- You shall die !

192
00:20:30,838 --> 00:20:34,425
You shall never obtain
the Necronomicon !

193
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:38,930
We shall feast
upon your souls !

194
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:45,895
Oh !

195
00:20:59,951 --> 00:21:04,080
- It's a trick. Get an axe.

196
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:12,296
- Guards, stop it !

197
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:14,966
- Catch the witch !
- Death to the witch !

198
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:17,093
Have some porridge !

199
00:21:17,301 --> 00:21:20,471
Ah, my eyes ! I'm blind !
Oh, God, I'm blind !

200
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:24,517
No, don't !

201
00:21:29,063 --> 00:21:31,858
Yo, she-bitch.

202
00:21:32,066 --> 00:21:34,819
- Let's go.

203
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,612
Ya-hoo !

204
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:38,990
Hee-ya !

205
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:42,618
- Hee-ya !

206
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,593
If the Necronomicon fell into
the hands of the Deadites,

207
00:21:58,801 --> 00:22:01,470
all mankind will be consumed
by this evil.

208
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,391
Now will thou
quest for the book ?

209
00:22:17,861 --> 00:22:21,448
That one.

210
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:42,969
Hee-ya !

211
00:22:46,348 --> 00:22:49,726
Groovy.

212
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:04,282
What's the matter ?
You raised in a barn ? Shut the door.

213
00:23:04,491 --> 00:23:09,704
Probably was raised in a barn
with all the other primitives.

214
00:23:17,045 --> 00:23:21,508
The wise men say that
thou art The Promised One.

215
00:23:23,552 --> 00:23:27,138
'Tis said that thou wilt journey
for the book to help us,

216
00:23:27,347 --> 00:23:29,599
and that thou wilt lead
our people against the evil.

217
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:35,146
The only reason I'm going
to get the book is to get home.

218
00:23:39,401 --> 00:23:41,778
I believe that thou wilt be
leaving in the morning.

219
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,030
Don't touch that, please.
Your primitive intellect...

220
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:46,116
wouldn't understand
alloys and compositions...

221
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:51,162
and things with
molecular structures in the--

222
00:23:52,163 --> 00:23:54,833
What are you
doin' here anyway ?

223
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:57,544
I wanted to say
that all of my--

224
00:23:57,752 --> 00:24:00,087
all of my hopes and
prayers go with you,

225
00:24:00,296 --> 00:24:03,132
and I made this
for thee.

226
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,760
Good, I could use
a horse blanket.

227
00:24:28,032 --> 00:24:31,577
Gimme some sugar, baby.

228
00:24:39,877 --> 00:24:44,465
Hyah ! Come on, boy !

229
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,219
Hyah !

230
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:57,603
Hyah !

231
00:25:04,026 --> 00:25:06,195
- Steady now. Whoa.

232
00:25:11,075 --> 00:25:13,536
What ? What is it ?

233
00:25:13,744 --> 00:25:16,330
This path will lead you
to an unholy place.

234
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:21,836
A cemetery. There,
the Necronomicon awaits.

235
00:25:23,796 --> 00:25:27,883
When thou retrievest the book from
its cradle, you must recite the words,

236
00:25:28,092 --> 00:25:30,886
"Klaatu barada nikto."

237
00:25:31,095 --> 00:25:34,682
Klaatu barada nikto.
Okay.

238
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,892
Well, repeat them.

239
00:25:37,101 --> 00:25:40,354
- Klaatu barada nikto.
- Again !

240
00:25:40,563 --> 00:25:43,899
I got it, I got it !
I know your damn words, all right ?

241
00:25:44,108 --> 00:25:46,609
Now you get this straight,
the both of you.

242
00:25:46,818 --> 00:25:49,696
If I get that book,
you send me back.

243
00:25:49,904 --> 00:25:52,198
After that,
I'm history. Hyah !

244
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,657
What is it, boy ?

245
00:26:47,879 --> 00:26:50,757
Hyah ! Come on !

246
00:26:58,389 --> 00:27:01,351
Hyah ! Come on !

247
00:27:06,356 --> 00:27:09,275
Aah ! Come on !

248
00:27:09,484 --> 00:27:12,612
Come on, you !

249
00:28:56,423 --> 00:29:00,511
Hey, let's scare
this guy good ! Come on.

250
00:29:02,012 --> 00:29:04,014
Ramming speed !

251
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:11,897
Ooh !

252
00:29:12,105 --> 00:29:14,900
Ready, aim, fire !

253
00:29:15,108 --> 00:29:17,778
- Ooh !
- Get away !

254
00:29:17,986 --> 00:29:19,905
Whoa !

255
00:29:20,112 --> 00:29:22,073
- Oh, God ! Oh, no !
- Oh--

256
00:29:22,281 --> 00:29:25,493
- Oh !
- You lousy little--

257
00:29:25,701 --> 00:29:27,787
Oh, no !

258
00:29:27,995 --> 00:29:29,580
Ooh, no ! Oh, my !

259
00:29:29,789 --> 00:29:32,083
Uh, ooh, aah !

260
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:36,003
- Lift up !
- Oh, ooh-hoo-ha !

261
00:29:36,212 --> 00:29:40,258
- Ooh, aah !

262
00:29:42,593 --> 00:29:45,721
Aah-ha-ha !

263
00:29:51,686 --> 00:29:54,939
Heh heh heh-heh--
Whoa !

264
00:29:55,273 --> 00:29:57,358
## London Bridge
is falling down #

265
00:29:57,567 --> 00:30:00,444
# Falling down #

266
00:30:00,653 --> 00:30:03,447
# Falling down #

267
00:30:03,656 --> 00:30:06,367
- # My fair lady ## Ha !

268
00:30:10,705 --> 00:30:16,961
Ooh !

269
00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:19,714
Is he up ?
How is he ?

270
00:30:19,922 --> 00:30:23,467
Hey,
he's gettin' up.

271
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:32,435
Hmm,
what a horrible nightmare.

272
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:36,939
Wait a minute.
Oh, God !

273
00:30:37,148 --> 00:30:39,025
I can't move !

274
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:44,864
Aah !

275
00:30:45,698 --> 00:30:48,242
- And go !
- Open wide.

276
00:30:48,451 --> 00:30:54,832
Geronimo !

277
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:57,043
- Hooray !
- Hooray !

278
00:31:20,565 --> 00:31:22,901
- Ah !

279
00:31:23,109 --> 00:31:27,364
Okay, little fella.
How about some hot chocolate, huh ?

280
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:40,836
How'd you like
the taste of that, huh ?

281
00:31:41,044 --> 00:31:42,963
How'd you like the ta--

282
00:31:46,842 --> 00:31:49,427
Aah, uh, ugh, oh !

283
00:31:49,636 --> 00:31:53,348
Ah ! Oh !

284
00:31:53,515 --> 00:31:57,519
Let me out !

285
00:31:59,646 --> 00:32:03,400
Oh, dear God,
it's growing bigger !

286
00:32:19,457 --> 00:32:23,795
Ooh, ooh, I'm blind.
I'm blind. Bleh.

287
00:32:27,465 --> 00:32:30,760
Yip, yip, yah !

288
00:32:30,969 --> 00:32:36,433
Oh, hey ! Where are you takin' me ?
Uh, oh, ooh !

289
00:32:42,063 --> 00:32:44,482
What are you ?

290
00:32:44,691 --> 00:32:46,985
Are you me ?

291
00:32:47,194 --> 00:32:50,614
I'm bad Ash,
and you're good Ash.

292
00:32:50,822 --> 00:32:52,657
You're goody
little two-shoes.

293
00:32:52,866 --> 00:32:56,869
## You're goody little two-shoes
goody little two-shoes #

294
00:32:57,077 --> 00:32:59,663
# Little goody two-shoes
Little goody two-shoes #

295
00:32:59,872 --> 00:33:04,543
# Little goody two-shoes
Little goody two-shoes
Little goody two-shoes #

296
00:33:04,752 --> 00:33:08,255
- Ow !

297
00:33:08,923 --> 00:33:10,799
# Little goody two-shoes ##

298
00:33:14,887 --> 00:33:18,390
Aah !

299
00:33:22,394 --> 00:33:27,983
Good, bad.
I'm the guy with the gun.

300
00:34:27,751 --> 00:34:33,382
That'll teach you.
Yeah, that'll teach you.

301
00:34:34,133 --> 00:34:36,594
You shall never retrieve
the Necronomicon !

302
00:34:36,802 --> 00:34:39,889
You'll die in the graveyard
before you get it !

303
00:34:40,097 --> 00:34:44,726
- What's that you got on your face ?
- Huh ?

304
00:34:44,934 --> 00:34:48,646
I'll come back for you !

305
00:34:54,027 --> 00:34:58,740
- Hyah !

306
00:34:58,907 --> 00:35:02,410
Come on, boy !

307
00:35:09,667 --> 00:35:13,421
Hyah !

308
00:36:18,027 --> 00:36:21,614
Three books ?

309
00:36:24,534 --> 00:36:26,828
Wait a minute.
Hold it.

310
00:36:27,036 --> 00:36:31,540
Nobody said anything
about three books.

311
00:36:31,748 --> 00:36:33,542
L-Like what
am I supposed to do ?

312
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:40,299
Take one book,
or all books, or, or what ?

313
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:44,011
Well.

314
00:37:36,313 --> 00:37:40,734
Whoa. Wrong book.

315
00:38:15,394 --> 00:38:17,311
Ow !

316
00:38:22,817 --> 00:38:24,652
Aah ! Ooh !

317
00:38:34,162 --> 00:38:36,914
Ooh ! Ooh, you !

318
00:38:37,123 --> 00:38:40,835
I'll get back to you.

319
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:42,044
Well...

320
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:43,337
Well...

321
00:38:43,546 --> 00:38:46,966
seems fairly obvious.

322
00:38:49,594 --> 00:38:55,183
Ooh, wait a minute. The words.
All right, all right, all right.

323
00:38:55,391 --> 00:38:58,811
Say the words.

324
00:39:01,022 --> 00:39:04,192
Klaatu... barada...

325
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,945
Iu--

326
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,285
necktie.

327
00:39:14,494 --> 00:39:17,538
Nectar, n-- nickel.

328
00:39:17,747 --> 00:39:20,333
Noodle.
It's an "N" word.

329
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:24,629
It's definitely
an "N" word.

330
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:29,217
It's definitely
an "N" word.

331
00:39:39,393 --> 00:39:44,190
Klaatu barada n--

332
00:39:58,204 --> 00:40:03,042
Okay, then.
That's it.

333
00:40:12,717 --> 00:40:15,220
Hey. Wait a minute.

334
00:40:15,428 --> 00:40:19,558
Everything's cool.
I said the words. I did !

335
00:40:19,766 --> 00:40:25,397
- Oh ! Oh ! No, wait ! Oh !

336
00:40:30,986 --> 00:40:35,323
You people, seek cover !
To the parapet !

337
00:40:35,532 --> 00:40:37,450
Seek your children !

338
00:40:37,659 --> 00:40:41,121
- Steady the horses !

339
00:40:41,329 --> 00:40:44,916
Something's wrong.
Something's amiss.

340
00:41:16,823 --> 00:41:20,827
Where'd you go ?
Where'd you g--

341
00:41:43,683 --> 00:41:46,478
Oh, oh, aah !

342
00:41:48,688 --> 00:41:50,648
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

343
00:41:53,609 --> 00:41:58,989
Ow ! I'll crush ya !
I'll mash ya into paste, you bony cre--

344
00:42:19,009 --> 00:42:22,429
- Hyah !

345
00:42:23,264 --> 00:42:26,684
I'm through being their garbage boy.
I did my part.

346
00:42:26,892 --> 00:42:30,521
Now I want back,
like in the deal. Hyah !

347
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:45,077
I... live...

348
00:42:46,912 --> 00:42:48,873
again.

349
00:42:58,966 --> 00:43:02,761
There ! The Promised One !
The Promised One's returned !

350
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:07,641
Raise the portcullis !

351
00:43:09,393 --> 00:43:14,899
Welcome home !
We're saved !

352
00:43:15,107 --> 00:43:19,111
- The Necronomicon !
- Truly he is The Promised One !

353
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,780
- He's brought the Necronomicon !
- How are ya ?

354
00:43:21,989 --> 00:43:24,950
- He's brought the book !
- Yeah, great, great.

355
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:27,036
- Good boy !
- Get the fuck outta my face !

356
00:43:33,501 --> 00:43:38,421
The Necronomicon, quickly.
Did you bring the Necronomicon ?

357
00:43:38,546 --> 00:43:42,509
- Yeah, it's, it's just that--
- Just what ?

358
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:46,262
Nothin'.
Here.

359
00:43:50,642 --> 00:43:54,187
Now send me back.
Like in the deal.

360
00:43:54,395 --> 00:43:59,234
When you removed the Necronomicon from
the cradle, did you speak the words ?

361
00:43:59,442 --> 00:44:02,111
- Yeah, basically.
- Did you speak the exact words ?

362
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,906
Look, maybe I didn't say every
single, little tiny syllable,

363
00:44:05,114 --> 00:44:08,034
- no, but basically I said 'em, yeah.
- Dung-eating fool !

364
00:44:08,243 --> 00:44:11,871
Thou hast doomed us all !
When thou misspoke the words,

365
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,998
the army
of the dead awoke !

366
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:16,417
Now, whoa, whoa,
right there, spinach chin.

367
00:44:16,626 --> 00:44:19,712
You said you could clean this mess up
once you got that book.

368
00:44:19,921 --> 00:44:23,383
You said there was a passage that could
get rid of this thing and send me back.

369
00:44:23,591 --> 00:44:25,969
It's true, the book still possesses
the power to send you back,

370
00:44:26,177 --> 00:44:27,971
but to us
it is useless !

371
00:44:28,179 --> 00:44:30,640
The evil has a terrible hunger
for the Necronomicon,

372
00:44:30,849 --> 00:44:33,643
and it will come here
to get it.

373
00:44:33,852 --> 00:44:36,396
We had a deal.

374
00:44:36,604 --> 00:44:39,315
You wanted the damn book,
I got it for ya.

375
00:44:39,524 --> 00:44:41,484
I did my part,
now you send me back.

376
00:44:41,693 --> 00:44:44,237
Very well.
As we are men of our word,

377
00:44:44,445 --> 00:44:48,283
we shall honor
our bargain.

378
00:44:48,491 --> 00:44:52,370
The wise men shall return you
to your own time.

379
00:44:52,579 --> 00:44:54,330
Yeah ?

380
00:44:54,539 --> 00:44:56,708
- I thought he was the one.
- Yeah, right.

381
00:44:56,916 --> 00:44:58,793
'Cause that
was the deal.

382
00:44:59,002 --> 00:45:01,337
So when do you think
we can...

383
00:45:01,546 --> 00:45:04,340
start with all
the thing and the--

384
00:45:04,549 --> 00:45:06,384
He's nothin'
but a traitor, he is !

385
00:45:06,593 --> 00:45:08,386
When do you
think we can start...

386
00:45:08,595 --> 00:45:12,015
with all the, uh,
ceremony and, uh--

387
00:45:12,223 --> 00:45:14,058
Agh ! Wretched excuse
for a man !

388
00:45:14,267 --> 00:45:19,022
The wise men were fools
to trust in you.

389
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:21,024
I knew he couldn't be trusted.

390
00:45:21,232 --> 00:45:23,902
We put our trust in him.

391
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:26,862
I still believe
that thou wilt help us.

392
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:32,493
Oh, Sheila,
don't you get it ? It's over.

393
00:45:32,493 --> 00:45:36,455
I didn't have
what it took.

394
00:45:36,747 --> 00:45:40,292
So long.

395
00:45:42,503 --> 00:45:44,296
But what of the things
that we've shared ?

396
00:45:44,505 --> 00:45:47,883
What of all the sweet words
that you spoke in private ?

397
00:45:48,091 --> 00:45:50,552
Aw, well--

398
00:45:50,761 --> 00:45:54,765
Well, that's just what we call
"pillow talk," baby. That's all.

399
00:45:54,973 --> 00:45:58,393
It was more than that.

400
00:45:58,727 --> 00:46:01,230
I still have faith
in thee.

401
00:46:01,438 --> 00:46:06,527
I still believe that thou
wilt stay and save us. I--

402
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:14,034
Coward !

403
00:46:14,993 --> 00:46:16,954
- Look there ! A demon !

404
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:36,473
Ash ! Help me !

405
00:46:36,682 --> 00:46:39,184
Sheila !

406
00:46:42,855 --> 00:46:46,358
Yaaah !

407
00:46:50,028 --> 00:46:54,491
- Shoot the bloody thing !
- Hold your arms ! You'll hit the girl !

408
00:46:58,954 --> 00:47:02,541
Uh, me sword !

409
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:05,335
Yaaah !

410
00:47:05,544 --> 00:47:07,129
Damn you !

411
00:47:25,396 --> 00:47:30,109
Dig, damn you !
Dig faster !

412
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:33,321
I shall command every
worm-infested son-of-a-bitch...

413
00:47:33,529 --> 00:47:35,323
- that ever died in battle !
- Thank you, sir !

414
00:47:35,531 --> 00:47:37,575
- You there, handsomely now.
- Aye, my liege.

415
00:47:37,783 --> 00:47:40,203
We shall storm their castle
and get my book !

416
00:47:40,411 --> 00:47:44,665
Hoist,
you damnable varlets !

417
00:47:47,418 --> 00:47:51,047
Welcome back
to the land of the living.

418
00:47:51,255 --> 00:47:54,842
Now pick up a shovel
and get digging !

419
00:47:55,051 --> 00:48:00,139
- Bring on the wench !

420
00:48:10,149 --> 00:48:15,321
- Gimme some sugar, baby.

421
00:48:15,321 --> 00:48:17,865
Well.

422
00:48:18,074 --> 00:48:22,453
Now, ain't you
a sweet little thing ?

423
00:48:22,662 --> 00:48:25,081
Don't touch me,
you foul thing !

424
00:48:25,289 --> 00:48:27,458
Come on.

425
00:48:27,667 --> 00:48:31,379
That's it.

426
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:36,884
We got plans for you, girly-girl.
Move !

427
00:48:37,426 --> 00:48:41,264
Have you lost your bones,
you decomposed gobs ? Get thee hence !

428
00:48:50,314 --> 00:48:53,734
A scout approaches !

429
00:48:58,781 --> 00:49:01,741
- Whoa !
- Hey, get his horse.

430
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:03,743
Arise.

431
00:49:03,952 --> 00:49:05,787
My lord, an army of the dead
gather in the wilderness.

432
00:49:05,996 --> 00:49:08,248
- They approach the castle.
- How far from here?

433
00:49:08,456 --> 00:49:09,791
But two days' ride.

434
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,877
These winged ones
are only the first of them.

435
00:49:12,085 --> 00:49:13,920
Perhaps we should leave
as soon as possible.

436
00:49:14,129 --> 00:49:15,922
- We could be safe in the mountains.
- Yes, the mountains.

437
00:49:16,131 --> 00:49:18,508
- We must flee !
- It is written. It has been foretold.

438
00:49:18,717 --> 00:49:20,886
- They'll take our souls.
They'll swallow our souls.
- I'm afraid !

439
00:49:21,094 --> 00:49:24,222
- I don't want to die !

440
00:49:24,431 --> 00:49:28,768
That's it.
Go ahead and run.

441
00:49:28,977 --> 00:49:31,771
Run home
and cry to mama !

442
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:37,277
Me ?
I'm through runnin' !

443
00:49:37,903 --> 00:49:41,114
I say we stay here
and fight it out.

444
00:49:41,323 --> 00:49:45,744
Are all men from
the future loudmouthed braggarts ?

445
00:49:45,952 --> 00:49:50,790
Nope. Just me, baby.
Just me.

446
00:49:50,999 --> 00:49:55,337
How will we fight an army of the dead
at our castle walls ?

447
00:49:55,545 --> 00:49:58,215
How will you fight that ?
More words ?

448
00:49:58,423 --> 00:50:00,217
Most of our people
have already fled.

449
00:50:00,425 --> 00:50:03,011
We are but 60 men.

450
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:08,141
Then we'll get Henry the Red
and his men to fight with us.

451
00:50:09,351 --> 00:50:15,232
Now... who's with me ?

452
00:50:28,286 --> 00:50:31,832
I'll stand by ya.

453
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:34,543
You can count on my steel.

454
00:50:34,751 --> 00:50:36,586
I'll offer up my courage.

455
00:50:36,795 --> 00:50:40,340
- Me sword's by his side.
- I'm with you !

456
00:50:40,549 --> 00:50:43,009
- I'll bend my bow to your will, sir.
- And mine !

457
00:50:45,345 --> 00:50:47,471
We'll stay !

458
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,683
Hail ! Hail !
Hail ! Hail !

459
00:50:50,891 --> 00:50:57,690
Hail ! Hail ! Hail !

460
00:51:05,322 --> 00:51:07,199
Well, my dear,

461
00:51:07,408 --> 00:51:11,495
say hello to the boys.

462
00:51:14,665 --> 00:51:20,004
- There's a sight for sore bones.

463
00:51:22,715 --> 00:51:25,092
I may be bad,

464
00:51:25,301 --> 00:51:28,596
but I feel... good.

465
00:51:28,804 --> 00:51:31,432
- Who rules ?
- To you, my lord.

466
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,475
You, sir. To the castle.

467
00:51:33,684 --> 00:51:37,188
The castle !

468
00:51:37,938 --> 00:51:39,815
Hurry up now.

469
00:51:40,024 --> 00:51:42,401
The castle ! Let's push.

470
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:46,989
Heave-ho.
Good. Yeah.

471
00:52:45,004 --> 00:52:46,923
Ha ! Hoo !

472
00:52:47,131 --> 00:52:48,925
Hai-ya !

473
00:52:49,133 --> 00:52:52,345
Ha ! Hoo ! Hai-ya !

474
00:52:52,554 --> 00:52:55,974
Yeah !

475
00:52:56,224 --> 00:53:01,563
They're coming !
The Deadites approach !

476
00:53:17,453 --> 00:53:20,999
There's so damn
many of 'em.

477
00:53:22,584 --> 00:53:24,544
Maybe--

478
00:53:24,752 --> 00:53:29,757
Just maybe my boys can stop 'em
from gettin' the book.

479
00:53:32,969 --> 00:53:34,804
Yeah.

480
00:53:35,013 --> 00:53:37,473
And maybe
I'm a Chinese jet pilot.

481
00:54:10,757 --> 00:54:14,719
Battle stations ! All right, get those
rocks up, mister, on the double !

482
00:54:14,928 --> 00:54:21,183
Ready the catapults !
By God, let's give 'em what for.

483
00:54:28,649 --> 00:54:30,442
And halt !

484
00:54:30,651 --> 00:54:35,697
- Company, halt !
- Company, halt !

485
00:54:41,453 --> 00:54:44,248
I'll rip his balls off.

486
00:55:16,822 --> 00:55:21,201
Bring forth the scout !

487
00:55:21,493 --> 00:55:23,453
Whoa.

488
00:55:23,662 --> 00:55:26,415
My lord, we are positioned
on both fronts.

489
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:29,960
Fine, fine, fine.
Where are they keeping my book ?

490
00:55:30,169 --> 00:55:32,963
There, my lord,
beyond the wall.

491
00:55:33,172 --> 00:55:36,383
The parapet. That would be
the most likely place.

492
00:55:36,592 --> 00:55:40,971
Right. Bring me forth
into that castle !

493
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:43,974
- Forward !
- Forward !

494
00:55:44,183 --> 00:55:48,979
Cry havoc and let loose
the dogs of war !

495
00:55:49,188 --> 00:55:51,773
To the castle !

496
00:55:51,982 --> 00:55:55,444
Fly, mate ! Fly !

497
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:59,948
Death to the mortals !

498
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,326
Arrows.

499
00:56:02,534 --> 00:56:06,163
Torch boy !

500
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:42,865
Steady.

501
00:56:48,246 --> 00:56:51,833
Fire !

502
00:56:52,917 --> 00:56:58,005
- Advance, you beasts, advance !

503
00:57:05,263 --> 00:57:09,392
Oh ! Oh !

504
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:15,022
Yeah, baby !

505
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:22,446
- All right !

506
00:57:22,655 --> 00:57:26,909
Sire, there's a second division
approaching from the south.

507
00:57:27,118 --> 00:57:31,581
Ram the gate !

508
00:57:34,292 --> 00:57:35,793
Catapults.

509
00:57:36,002 --> 00:57:38,129
Catapults out !

510
00:57:46,304 --> 00:57:48,639
Yeah !

511
00:57:48,848 --> 00:57:52,768
Fire !

512
00:57:56,354 --> 00:57:59,149
Look there !

513
00:58:03,028 --> 00:58:05,989
Yeah !

514
00:58:06,198 --> 00:58:09,534
- Seek cover !
- Watch out !

515
00:58:09,743 --> 00:58:13,288
- Make way !

516
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:23,965
Oh !

517
00:58:24,174 --> 00:58:26,801
Oh, you miserable
bags of bones !

518
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:29,846
Pick yourselves up
and sally fo...

519
00:58:32,057 --> 00:58:34,017
Sally for--

520
00:58:34,226 --> 00:58:37,687
Sally forth.

521
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:42,442
Come on,
you miserable wretches.

522
00:58:42,651 --> 00:58:45,153
Lower.

523
00:58:45,362 --> 00:58:49,533
Heave !

524
00:58:53,203 --> 00:58:56,832
Forward !

525
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:01,294
Buttress the door, now !

526
00:59:10,262 --> 00:59:14,349
Hold fast !

527
00:59:16,268 --> 00:59:18,854
- Back !
- Stone these creatures !

528
00:59:19,062 --> 00:59:22,816
Damn you !

529
00:59:23,733 --> 00:59:25,735
Ooh, that's gotta hurt.

530
00:59:25,944 --> 00:59:28,363
Go, you creatures !
Arrows !

531
00:59:28,572 --> 00:59:31,992
Load !
Fire !

532
00:59:34,578 --> 00:59:37,914
- Heave ! Put your...

533
00:59:38,123 --> 00:59:41,251
backbones into it.

534
00:59:41,459 --> 00:59:43,711
We've broken through !
The castle is ours !

535
00:59:49,133 --> 00:59:53,721
Kill the mortals !

536
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:59,476
- Get it achieved and fast !

537
01:00:12,948 --> 01:00:16,994
Their ranks are broken !
Have at them !

538
01:00:17,286 --> 01:00:22,291
Ha ! Hoo ! Hai-ya !
Ha ! Hoo ! Hai-ya !

539
01:00:27,588 --> 01:00:30,591
Pull back !
Man the parapet !

540
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:32,593
Protect the book.

541
01:00:32,801 --> 01:00:36,555
God save us all.

542
01:00:40,017 --> 01:00:43,062
Say hello
to the 21st century. Yeah !

543
01:00:55,825 --> 01:00:59,078
Come on !
I got plenty for everybody !

544
01:00:59,286 --> 01:01:01,413
Look out !

545
01:01:01,622 --> 01:01:04,416
- Whoo !

546
01:01:07,127 --> 01:01:11,090
- Bye-bye.

547
01:01:11,674 --> 01:01:15,344
It's the one in the cart we want !
Get him !

548
01:01:15,553 --> 01:01:19,974
- Yaaah !

549
01:01:25,729 --> 01:01:27,481
Yaaaaah !

550
01:01:49,419 --> 01:01:52,338
Sheila ?

551
01:02:14,694 --> 01:02:17,405
- We've secured the courtyard, my lord.

552
01:02:17,614 --> 01:02:21,034
Excellent.

553
01:02:32,378 --> 01:02:35,840
Ooh ! Hey ! Look out !

554
01:02:41,387 --> 01:02:44,349
- Hey, you're mine, sweetie.

555
01:02:44,557 --> 01:02:47,977
Get off of her !

556
01:02:50,647 --> 01:02:52,440
Gotcha !

557
01:02:52,649 --> 01:02:56,027
Damn you !

558
01:02:57,612 --> 01:03:00,615
- My lord.
- Stay with the book.

559
01:03:00,824 --> 01:03:05,078
The book's where we are.

560
01:03:06,496 --> 01:03:11,876
The Red ! The Red !
Duke Henry and his men have come !

561
01:03:13,044 --> 01:03:15,672
Blows, blood...

562
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:20,217
and death !

563
01:03:22,177 --> 01:03:24,471
Duke Henry ! Ha-ha !

564
01:03:30,102 --> 01:03:33,897
Die !

565
01:03:34,857 --> 01:03:39,903
Onward, valiant cousins !
Their ranks are broke !

566
01:03:45,868 --> 01:03:47,953
Oops !

567
01:03:48,162 --> 01:03:52,416
Hello !

568
01:03:56,378 --> 01:03:59,464
There ya go.

569
01:03:59,673 --> 01:04:03,343
The book is mine.

570
01:04:11,185 --> 01:04:13,312
I'll cut your gizzard out.

571
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:16,940
- Hey, where'd he go ?

572
01:04:26,074 --> 01:04:28,911
Come to papa.

573
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:32,623
Get him !

574
01:04:57,356 --> 01:05:00,234
Oh, you crazy bitch,
get off of me !

575
01:05:00,442 --> 01:05:03,862
Ha !

576
01:05:06,572 --> 01:05:09,992
Right.

577
01:05:14,622 --> 01:05:17,416
You found me beautiful once.

578
01:05:17,625 --> 01:05:20,837
Honey, you got real ugly.

579
01:05:37,812 --> 01:05:41,232
There we are.

580
01:05:47,738 --> 01:05:50,408
So you wanna
play rough, eh ?

581
01:05:50,616 --> 01:05:54,662
Okay.

582
01:05:55,288 --> 01:06:00,084
Oh.

583
01:06:00,626 --> 01:06:05,089
All right, all right.

584
01:06:05,882 --> 01:06:10,219
Prepare to die !

585
01:06:21,981 --> 01:06:24,567
You're going down !

586
01:06:24,775 --> 01:06:28,696
- I'm goin' up.
- I'm comin' for ya.

587
01:06:36,162 --> 01:06:40,541
Come on !

588
01:06:52,636 --> 01:06:54,513
- Oops. Excuse me.
- Come on.

589
01:06:54,721 --> 01:06:57,641
All right !

590
01:06:57,849 --> 01:07:03,021
You're pissin' me off,
you ugly son of a bitch !

591
01:07:20,539 --> 01:07:24,501
I'll spoil
those good looks.

592
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:28,338
Back-stabber !

593
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:34,177
Hold still !

594
01:07:44,187 --> 01:07:46,648
Tallyho !

595
01:07:48,275 --> 01:07:51,695
- We can't hold the battlements!

596
01:07:51,903 --> 01:07:54,823
We will hold !
We must protect the book !

597
01:08:07,294 --> 01:08:09,129
I got a bone
to pick with you.

598
01:08:09,337 --> 01:08:13,341
Come on.

599
01:08:18,054 --> 01:08:21,558
Slice that gizzard open.

600
01:08:36,490 --> 01:08:40,326
Now you're mine.

601
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:45,164
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

602
01:08:59,678 --> 01:09:03,724
At last, the book.

603
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,730
I possess the Necronomicon.

604
01:09:09,939 --> 01:09:13,442
I've crushed your pathetic army.
Now I'll have my vengeance.

605
01:09:13,651 --> 01:09:17,279
Buckle up, bonehead,
'cause you're goin' for a ride.

606
01:09:17,488 --> 01:09:21,200
Huh ?

607
01:09:32,211 --> 01:09:36,924
Victory's ours !

608
01:09:37,466 --> 01:09:42,972
- Retreat ! Retreat !
- Let's get the hell out of here !

609
01:10:07,788 --> 01:10:09,582
- Oh.
- Tricky ones, they are.

610
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:12,001
If it's a fight you want--

611
01:10:12,209 --> 01:10:17,131
Watch 'em, lads.
They're an untrust worthy lot.

612
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:04,260
Move yourself, lad !

613
01:11:04,469 --> 01:11:06,471
- Your hand, man. Godspeed !
- Hey, Henry. Yeah, nice goin'.

614
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:08,473
- My lady.
- Arthur.

615
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:11,768
- Well won, my friend.
- We've won the day.

616
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:15,522
- Yeah !
- Yeah !

617
01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:24,197
We're brothers
and a new kingdom shall be born !

618
01:11:25,657 --> 01:11:28,743
The book tells us that
once you drink this liquid...

619
01:11:28,952 --> 01:11:33,081
and recite the words,
"Klaatu barada nikto,"

620
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:37,585
thou shalt awaken
in thine own time.

621
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:43,883
Remember, you must
recite the words exactly.

622
01:12:13,203 --> 01:12:16,623
Hyah !

623
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:36,560
I thought about staying.

624
01:12:36,768 --> 01:12:41,356
They offered me the chance to lead them,
to teach them, to-- to be king.

625
01:12:41,565 --> 01:12:44,485
- Uh-huh.
- But my place is here.

626
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:49,156
- So I swallowed the juice,
said the words and here I am.
- Did you say...

627
01:12:49,364 --> 01:12:51,909
the words
right this time ?

628
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:55,204
Well, maybe I didn't say every
single, tiny little syllable, no,

629
01:12:55,412 --> 01:12:59,124
but basically
I said 'em, yeah.

630
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:02,794
Basically.

631
01:13:04,087 --> 01:13:06,798
You know that story about
how you could've been king ?

632
01:13:07,007 --> 01:13:09,968
I, uh, I think
it's kind of cute.

633
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:14,389
Yeah.

634
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:36,036
- Die !

635
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:50,259
Lady, I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave the store.

636
01:13:50,467 --> 01:13:52,761
Who the hell are you ?

637
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:55,597
Name's Ash.

638
01:13:55,806 --> 01:13:57,724
Housewares.

639
01:14:18,161 --> 01:14:20,955
I'll swallow your soul.

640
01:14:21,164 --> 01:14:25,334
Come get some.

641
01:14:42,643 --> 01:14:46,898
Sure, I could've
stayed in the past.

642
01:14:47,106 --> 01:14:50,776
Could've even been king.

643
01:14:50,985 --> 01:14:53,529
But in my own way,

644
01:14:53,738 --> 01:14:56,741
I am king.

645
01:14:56,949 --> 01:15:00,620
Hail to the king, baby.
