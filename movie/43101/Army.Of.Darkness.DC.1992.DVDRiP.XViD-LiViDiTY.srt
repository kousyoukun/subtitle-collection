1
00:00:32,736 --> 00:00:35,900
My name is Ash. And I am a slave.

2
00:00:39,231 --> 00:00:42,079
Close as I can figure it,
the year is 1300 AD...

3
00:00:42,143 --> 00:00:44,565
...and I am being dragged to my death.

4
00:00:44,704 --> 00:00:46,460
It wasn't always like this.

5
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,374
I had a real life once.

6
00:00:51,232 --> 00:00:52,344
A job.

7
00:00:58,656 --> 00:01:02,234
Hardware. Aisle 12.
Shop smart, shop S-Mart.

8
00:01:02,784 --> 00:01:05,653
I had a wonderful girlfriend, Linda.

9
00:01:08,704 --> 00:01:11,868
Together we drove to a small cabin
in the mountains.

10
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:18,591
It seems an archeologist
had come to this remote place...

11
00:01:18,656 --> 00:01:21,143
...to translate and study his latest find.

12
00:01:22,175 --> 00:01:26,453
Necronomicon ex Mortis.
The Book of the Dead.

13
00:01:28,735 --> 00:01:31,867
Bound in human flesh and inked in blood...

14
00:01:32,096 --> 00:01:36,154
...this ancient Sumerian text contained
bizarre burial rites...

15
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:40,821
...funerary incantations
and demon resurrection passages.

16
00:01:42,112 --> 00:01:44,730
It was never meant
for the world of the living.

17
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:47,868
The book awoke something
dark in the woods.

18
00:01:54,495 --> 00:01:55,924
It took Linda.

19
00:01:57,056 --> 00:01:58,943
And then it came for me.

20
00:02:00,352 --> 00:02:05,109
It got into my hand and it went bad.
So I lopped it off at the wrist.

21
00:02:11,104 --> 00:02:13,624
But that didn't stop it. It came back.

22
00:02:16,223 --> 00:02:17,433
Big time.

23
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,276
For God's sake! How do you stop it?

24
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,468
Surround the stranger!

25
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:48,570
Where the hell...

26
00:04:00,063 --> 00:04:03,063
Easy now, chief.
I don't know how I got here.

27
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,324
And I'm not looking for any trouble.

28
00:04:10,304 --> 00:04:11,962
What a piece of armor this is!

29
00:04:13,568 --> 00:04:14,615
Wiseman!

30
00:04:20,063 --> 00:04:23,641
My lord, I believe he is the one
written of in the Necronomicon.

31
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,365
He who is prophesied to fall
from the heavens...

32
00:04:26,431 --> 00:04:28,820
...and deliver us from
the terrors of the Deadites.

33
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,713
What? That buffoon?

34
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:32,250
Likely...

35
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,942
...he's one of Henry's men!

36
00:04:36,064 --> 00:04:38,485
Kneel, rapscallion!

37
00:04:39,744 --> 00:04:41,816
I say, to the pit with him!

38
00:04:46,016 --> 00:04:49,147
- To the pit!
- You miserable bastard!

39
00:04:50,976 --> 00:04:52,405
Get off of me!

40
00:04:54,687 --> 00:04:55,964
Let me go!

41
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,589
To the castle!

42
00:05:09,023 --> 00:05:12,340
Pick up your feet!
Stop dragging your feet! Come on!

43
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:17,083
Move along. Come on, now.
Come on, pick it up.

44
00:05:17,952 --> 00:05:19,894
Have a taste of this!

45
00:05:26,432 --> 00:05:27,577
All right, you men!

46
00:05:27,648 --> 00:05:31,706
You've got something to look forward to
when you get back to the castle!

47
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,895
Lord Arthur approaches!
Raise the portcullis!

48
00:05:37,856 --> 00:05:41,598
Lord Arthur! Lord Arthur approaches!

49
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:33,562
Lord Arthur, where is my brother?
Did he not ride with you?

50
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,701
Aye, and fought valiantly.

51
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,222
But last night he fell in battle
to Duke Henry's men.

52
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,374
I'm sorry, Sheila.

53
00:06:42,624 --> 00:06:44,533
- Come on.
- You cretin!

54
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:46,997
Stop it, you bastards!

55
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,854
Barbarians!

56
00:06:52,255 --> 00:06:54,677
Stop it! Stop it, you little bastards!

57
00:06:54,752 --> 00:06:55,700
Beat it!

58
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:00,862
Foul thing!

59
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,316
A pox on your throat!
Thou art a murderer!

60
00:07:04,735 --> 00:07:06,077
A bloody murderer!

61
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,372
My brother's death shall be avenged!

62
00:07:27,104 --> 00:07:29,144
Company, halt!

63
00:07:33,056 --> 00:07:34,583
Get that yoke off him!

64
00:07:47,904 --> 00:07:50,653
You, sir, are not one of my vassals.

65
00:07:52,383 --> 00:07:53,725
Who are you?

66
00:07:54,624 --> 00:07:56,217
Who wants to know?

67
00:07:57,312 --> 00:08:00,410
I am Henry the Red. Duke of Shale.

68
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,549
Lord of the Northlands
and leader of its peoples.

69
00:08:04,415 --> 00:08:08,638
Well, hello, Mister Fancy Pants.
I got news for you, pal.

70
00:08:08,832 --> 00:08:11,799
You ain't leading but two things right now,
jack and shit.

71
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:14,680
- And Jack left town.
- Shut your bleedin' hole!

72
00:08:15,007 --> 00:08:17,690
Gentlemen, Lord Arthur!

73
00:08:25,887 --> 00:08:28,440
There is an evil awakened in this land.

74
00:08:29,407 --> 00:08:32,953
And while my people fight
for their very souls against it...

75
00:08:33,151 --> 00:08:35,769
...you, Henry the Red, wage war on us.

76
00:08:36,031 --> 00:08:37,438
Charlatan!

77
00:08:39,744 --> 00:08:42,591
It was you who first turned
your swords on us.

78
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:45,525
And this evil has befouled
my people as well!

79
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,599
Your people are no better
than the foul corruption...

80
00:08:48,671 --> 00:08:50,776
...that lies in the bowels of that pit!

81
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,732
Right! You're no better!

82
00:08:52,928 --> 00:08:55,317
May God have mercy upon your souls.

83
00:09:09,695 --> 00:09:12,827
In God's name!
What hell-spawned thing lurks there?

84
00:09:18,112 --> 00:09:21,560
Into the pit
with those bloodthirsty sons of whores.

85
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:23,158
Move!

86
00:09:23,808 --> 00:09:24,756
No!

87
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:57,080
God! Heavenly God!

88
00:10:00,927 --> 00:10:02,356
He's escaping!

89
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:05,140
Hold him!

90
00:10:38,015 --> 00:10:40,404
They don't look so clever now, do they?

91
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:42,072
He's frightened!

92
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:48,156
Whoa, whoa! Wait a minute.

93
00:10:49,504 --> 00:10:51,576
Hold it. Wait a minute!

94
00:10:51,743 --> 00:10:53,718
You gotta understand, man.

95
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,118
I never even saw these assholes before!

96
00:10:58,015 --> 00:10:59,324
He trembles!

97
00:11:01,151 --> 00:11:02,810
What are you waiting for?

98
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,469
Henry, you gotta tell them
you don't know me.

99
00:11:06,143 --> 00:11:07,965
We never met, tell them!

100
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,861
I do not think he'll listen, lad.

101
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:18,713
Look, I'm telling you.
You've got the wrong guy.

102
00:11:28,735 --> 00:11:31,703
I'm telling you, you got the wrong guy.

103
00:12:44,735 --> 00:12:45,946
Why, you...

104
00:12:50,976 --> 00:12:55,416
- Spikes.
- Hey, he said spikes! Give him spikes!

105
00:13:09,023 --> 00:13:11,674
Make way! Strange one!

106
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,086
Strange one!

107
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:50,589
Damn you.

108
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,174
You know, your shoelace is untied.

109
00:15:24,703 --> 00:15:25,980
All right.

110
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:29,141
Who wants some?

111
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,640
Who's next?

112
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,198
How about it?

113
00:15:35,776 --> 00:15:39,998
Who wants some?
Who wants to have a little?

114
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:45,524
You.

115
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,000
You want some more?

116
00:15:55,392 --> 00:15:56,799
You want a little?

117
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,880
Do you? You want some more?

118
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,695
Now, get on those horses
and get out of here.

119
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,501
Let them go!

120
00:16:47,936 --> 00:16:48,884
Halt!

121
00:16:50,304 --> 00:16:52,475
Thank you, generous hosts!

122
00:16:53,952 --> 00:16:55,479
Sword boy!

123
00:17:03,007 --> 00:17:06,553
For that arrogance, I shall see you dead.

124
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,978
Sorcery!

125
00:17:16,671 --> 00:17:17,719
Yeah.

126
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,655
All right, you primitive screwheads,
listen up.

127
00:17:22,623 --> 00:17:23,965
See this?

128
00:17:24,928 --> 00:17:28,441
This is my boom stick!

129
00:17:29,728 --> 00:17:33,787
It's a 12-gauge, double-barreled Remington.
S-Mart's top of the line.

130
00:17:34,528 --> 00:17:36,949
You can find this
in the sporting goods department.

131
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:40,602
That's right, this sweet baby was made
in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

132
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,294
It retails for about $109.95.

133
00:17:43,776 --> 00:17:48,282
It's got a walnut stock,
cobalt-blue steel, and a hair trigger.

134
00:17:48,928 --> 00:17:53,532
That's right. Shop smart. Shop S-Mart.

135
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,767
You got that?

136
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,426
Now, I swear...

137
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,597
...the next one of you primates...

138
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:04,312
...even touches me...

139
00:18:32,576 --> 00:18:36,918
Now, let's talk about how I get back home.

140
00:19:06,784 --> 00:19:09,085
I prithee to forgive me, my Lord.

141
00:19:09,472 --> 00:19:11,861
I believed thee one of Henry's men.

142
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:15,126
First you wanna kill me,
now you wanna kiss me.

143
00:19:16,703 --> 00:19:17,750
Blow.

144
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:24,509
So what's the deal?
Can you send me back or not?

145
00:19:24,576 --> 00:19:28,886
Only the Necronomicon has the power,
an unholy book which we also require.

146
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:32,861
Within its pages are passages
that can send you back to your time.

147
00:19:33,056 --> 00:19:35,609
Only you, the promised one,
can quest for it.

148
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,734
I don't want your book.
I don't want your bullshit!

149
00:19:39,807 --> 00:19:43,036
Just send me back to my own time.
Pronto! Today! Chop...

150
00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:55,581
You shall die!

151
00:20:00,831 --> 00:20:03,930
You shall never take the Necronomicon.

152
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:08,349
We shall feast upon your souls!

153
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,924
It's a trick. Get an ax.

154
00:20:40,127 --> 00:20:41,949
Guards! Kill her!

155
00:20:43,328 --> 00:20:45,564
Capture the witch! Capture the witch!

156
00:20:46,303 --> 00:20:49,238
My eyes! I'm blind! Oh, God, I'm blind!

157
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:52,181
No!

158
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,869
Yo, she-bitch!

159
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,754
Let's go.

160
00:21:23,456 --> 00:21:26,173
If the Necronomicon fell into
the hands of the Deadites...

161
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,728
...all mankind will be consumed
by this evil.

162
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,101
Now will thou quest for the book?

163
00:21:44,384 --> 00:21:45,594
That one.

164
00:22:11,648 --> 00:22:12,989
Groovy.

165
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,822
What's the matter, you raised in a barn?
Shut the door.

166
00:22:29,152 --> 00:22:32,185
Probably was raised in a barn,
with all the other primitives.

167
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:43,862
The Wisemen say that thou art
the promised one.

168
00:22:47,551 --> 00:22:50,333
'Tis said thou wilt journey for the book
to help us.

169
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,985
And that thou wilt lead our people
against the evil.

170
00:22:53,055 --> 00:22:56,186
The only reason I'm going to get the book
is to get home.

171
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,315
I believe thou wilt be leaving
in the morning.

172
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,845
Don't touch that, please!

173
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,531
Your primitive intellect wouldn't
understand alloys and compositions...

174
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,633
...and things with molecular structures
and the...

175
00:23:15,168 --> 00:23:16,990
What are you doing here, anyway?

176
00:23:17,983 --> 00:23:22,042
I wanted to say that all of my hopes
and prayers go with thee...

177
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:24,375
...and I made this for thee.

178
00:23:25,376 --> 00:23:27,765
Good. I could use a horse blanket.

179
00:23:49,184 --> 00:23:51,006
Give me some sugar, baby.

180
00:24:53,696 --> 00:24:55,125
Come on, boys!

181
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,022
Steady, now.

182
00:25:22,496 --> 00:25:26,751
- What? What is it?
- This path will lead you to an unholy place.

183
00:25:27,263 --> 00:25:30,743
A cemetery.
There the Necronomicon awaits.

184
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:37,815
When thou retrievest the book from
its cradle, you must recite the words:

185
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:40,633
"Klaatu, barada, nikto."

186
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:45,404
- Klaatu, barada, nikto. Okay.
- Well, repeat them.

187
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:49,818
- Klaatu, barada, nikto.
- Again!

188
00:25:49,888 --> 00:25:53,084
I got it! I got it!
I know your damn words, all right?

189
00:25:53,728 --> 00:25:55,768
Now, you get this straight,
the both of you!

190
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,327
If I get that book, you send me back.

191
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,920
After that, I'm history.

192
00:27:02,111 --> 00:27:03,638
What is it, boy?

193
00:27:26,496 --> 00:27:28,056
Come on!

194
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,348
Ramming speed!

195
00:31:16,351 --> 00:31:18,042
Ready. Aim. Fire!

196
00:31:33,152 --> 00:31:34,493
Shake a leg!

197
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,170
You lousy little...

198
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:53,629
Yeah! I'm gonna hunt down all you...

199
00:32:09,952 --> 00:32:12,156
You little bastards! All right!

200
00:32:12,416 --> 00:32:16,245
I'll crush each and every one of you.
I'll crush you to pieces, I'm telling you!

201
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,451
I'll squash you so hard,
you'll have to look up to see...

202
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,926
Hey, dumb ass!

203
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,076
Surf's up!

204
00:32:36,768 --> 00:32:38,262
All together now!

205
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:56,311
Shit!

206
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,116
Quietly. Gently.

207
00:33:16,351 --> 00:33:18,009
Easy, big fella. Easy.

208
00:33:31,584 --> 00:33:34,682
"London Bridge is falling down

209
00:33:34,816 --> 00:33:39,453
"Falling down, falling down"

210
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:43,166
"My fair lady"

211
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:55,960
Is he up? Is he?

212
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,680
What a horrible nightmare.

213
00:34:08,287 --> 00:34:09,661
Wait a minute.

214
00:34:09,855 --> 00:34:11,742
Oh, God!

215
00:34:12,512 --> 00:34:14,300
I can't move!

216
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,901
Open wide!

217
00:34:29,055 --> 00:34:30,265
Let's go!

218
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,677
Geronimo!

219
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:41,690
Let's go!

220
00:35:03,871 --> 00:35:08,061
Okay, little fella.
How about some hot chocolate?

221
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,266
How'd you like the taste of that?
How'd you like the taste...

222
00:35:39,391 --> 00:35:41,879
Dear God! It's growing bigger!

223
00:36:04,032 --> 00:36:05,014
- Hey!
- Hey!

224
00:36:05,088 --> 00:36:07,357
- What's the big idea...
- What's the big idea...

225
00:36:07,424 --> 00:36:08,886
- Why, you...
- Why, you...

226
00:36:13,376 --> 00:36:15,099
I'm blind. I'm blind.

227
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,071
Where are you taking me?

228
00:36:27,391 --> 00:36:30,969
"Oh, Susanna, don't you cry for me

229
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:35,163
"'Cause I come from Alabama
with a banjo on my knee"

230
00:36:48,288 --> 00:36:49,695
What are you?

231
00:36:50,368 --> 00:36:51,644
Are you me?

232
00:36:51,807 --> 00:36:53,815
"What are you? Are you me?"

233
00:36:55,712 --> 00:36:58,199
- You sound like a jerk!
- Why are you doing this?

234
00:36:58,271 --> 00:37:01,337
You want to know?
Because the answer's easy.

235
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,335
I'm bad Ash. And you're good Ash.

236
00:37:05,568 --> 00:37:08,917
You're goody little two-shoes.
You're goody little two-shoes.

237
00:37:37,248 --> 00:37:38,841
I ain't that good.

238
00:38:49,504 --> 00:38:51,391
Now you see what's what.

239
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:55,580
A man's body is his own personal property.

240
00:38:56,992 --> 00:39:00,058
Don't let anybody try
and take that away from him.

241
00:39:01,663 --> 00:39:05,340
That'll teach you. Yeah. That'll teach you.

242
00:39:07,775 --> 00:39:10,328
You shall never retrieve the Necronomicon.

243
00:39:10,464 --> 00:39:13,333
You'll die in the graveyard
before you get it.

244
00:39:13,887 --> 00:39:16,953
Hey, what's that you got on your face?

245
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,709
- See how that works?
- I'll come back for you.

246
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:42,495
Come on, boy!

247
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,912
Come on!

248
00:41:12,992 --> 00:41:14,104
Three books?

249
00:41:18,527 --> 00:41:20,535
Wait a minute. Hold it.

250
00:41:20,959 --> 00:41:24,156
Nobody said anything about three books.

251
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,650
That stinking Wiseman!

252
00:41:26,815 --> 00:41:29,433
He was so busy filling me
with his secret words...

253
00:41:29,503 --> 00:41:33,595
...and his phrases, and his bullshit,
that he never said anything about this.

254
00:41:35,263 --> 00:41:39,966
Like what am I supposed to do?
Take one book, or all books, or what?

255
00:42:42,976 --> 00:42:44,285
Wrong book.

256
00:43:35,455 --> 00:43:36,917
Get outta here!

257
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:48,661
I'll get back to you.

258
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,610
Well...

259
00:43:53,343 --> 00:43:55,351
...it seems fairly obvious.

260
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,549
Wait a minute. The words. Right.

261
00:44:03,584 --> 00:44:05,373
Say the words.

262
00:44:08,832 --> 00:44:10,042
Klaatu...

263
00:44:10,783 --> 00:44:12,125
...barada...

264
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,175
Necktie.

265
00:44:21,695 --> 00:44:22,775
Nectar.

266
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:24,344
Nickel.

267
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,178
Noodle. It's an "N" word.
It's definitely an "N" word.

268
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,429
Definitely an "N" word!

269
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:48,346
Klaatu, barada...

270
00:45:03,744 --> 00:45:05,053
Okay, then.

271
00:45:06,176 --> 00:45:07,452
That's it.

272
00:45:17,567 --> 00:45:20,088
Hey! Wait a minute.

273
00:45:20,607 --> 00:45:24,219
Everything's cool. I said the word. I did!

274
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,862
No! Wait!

275
00:45:33,216 --> 00:45:34,198
No!

276
00:45:41,919 --> 00:45:44,985
You, people, seek cover! To the parapet!

277
00:45:46,144 --> 00:45:47,802
Seek your children.

278
00:45:49,632 --> 00:45:51,225
Steady the horses!

279
00:45:51,808 --> 00:45:54,296
Something's wrong. Something's amiss.

280
00:46:26,304 --> 00:46:27,765
Where'd you go?

281
00:47:02,144 --> 00:47:05,308
I'll crush you!
I'll mash your faces, you bony creatures!

282
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:17,622
Keep your damn, filthy bones
out of my mouth.

283
00:47:34,495 --> 00:47:35,673
Come on!

284
00:47:41,184 --> 00:47:45,918
I'm through being their garbage boy.
I did my part. Now I want back.

285
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,736
Like in the deal.

286
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,259
I...

287
00:48:03,424 --> 00:48:05,049
...live...

288
00:48:06,527 --> 00:48:08,829
...again!

289
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:21,855
There! The promised one!
The promised one's returned!

290
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:24,312
Raise the portcullis!

291
00:48:36,543 --> 00:48:40,918
Truly, he is the promised one!
He's brought the Necronomicon.

292
00:48:40,991 --> 00:48:42,846
- Hi.
- He's got the book!

293
00:48:42,911 --> 00:48:44,253
Yeah, great.

294
00:48:45,056 --> 00:48:47,096
Get the fuck out of my face.

295
00:48:52,992 --> 00:48:56,701
The Necronomicon, quickly.
Did you bring the Necronomicon?

296
00:48:57,696 --> 00:49:00,216
- Yeah, it's just that...
- Just what?

297
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:03,868
Nothing. Here.

298
00:49:10,208 --> 00:49:12,663
Now send me back. Like in the deal.

299
00:49:13,088 --> 00:49:17,463
When you removed the Necronomicon
from the cradle, did you speak the words?

300
00:49:17,792 --> 00:49:20,726
- Yeah, basically.
- Did you speak the exact words?

301
00:49:20,799 --> 00:49:23,647
Look, maybe I didn't say every single,
little tiny syllable...

302
00:49:23,712 --> 00:49:26,395
...but basically, I said 'em.
- Dung-eating fool!

303
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,318
Thou hast doomed us all.

304
00:49:28,448 --> 00:49:31,863
When thou misspoke the words,
the army of the dead awoke.

305
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,072
Now, whoa, right there, spinach-chin.

306
00:49:34,272 --> 00:49:37,087
You said you could clean this mess up
once you got that book.

307
00:49:37,152 --> 00:49:40,981
That there's a passage in there that could
get rid of this thing and send me back.

308
00:49:41,055 --> 00:49:44,121
It's true, the book still possesses
the power to send you back.

309
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:48,315
But to us, it is useless! The evil has
a terrible hunger for the Necronomicon.

310
00:49:48,383 --> 00:49:50,685
And it will come here to get it!

311
00:49:51,456 --> 00:49:52,885
We had a deal.

312
00:49:53,503 --> 00:49:56,154
You wanted the damn book,
I got it for you!

313
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:58,328
I did my part, now you send me back!

314
00:49:58,399 --> 00:49:59,544
Very well.

315
00:49:59,744 --> 00:50:03,737
As we are men of our word,
we shall honor our bargain.

316
00:50:04,863 --> 00:50:07,733
The Wiseman shall return you
to your own time.

317
00:50:08,576 --> 00:50:09,623
Yeah?

318
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,382
I thought he was the one.

319
00:50:12,447 --> 00:50:15,796
Yeah, right, because that was the deal.

320
00:50:16,127 --> 00:50:20,382
So when do you think we can start
with all the thing and the...

321
00:50:20,448 --> 00:50:22,302
He's nothing but a traitor, he is!

322
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:27,227
When do you think we can start
with all the ceremony and the...

323
00:50:27,999 --> 00:50:31,065
...you know, like, you know, because...

324
00:50:31,616 --> 00:50:34,299
...sooner's always better than later, right?

325
00:50:34,688 --> 00:50:39,706
- Wretched excuse for a man.
- The Wisemen were fools to trust in you.

326
00:50:41,151 --> 00:50:44,828
- I knew he couldn't be trusted.
- I trusted him.

327
00:50:46,208 --> 00:50:48,761
I still believe that thou wilt help us.

328
00:50:48,896 --> 00:50:52,278
Sheila. Don't you get it? It's over.

329
00:50:53,919 --> 00:50:55,926
I didn't have what it took.

330
00:50:58,111 --> 00:50:59,289
So long.

331
00:51:04,448 --> 00:51:05,877
You would leave me?

332
00:51:06,368 --> 00:51:08,986
Cripes, I don't belong here.

333
00:51:10,368 --> 00:51:12,637
I got a chance to go back, and I'm taking it.

334
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,939
But what of the things that we've shared?

335
00:51:15,008 --> 00:51:18,303
What of all the sweet words
that you spoke in private?

336
00:51:20,255 --> 00:51:24,052
Well, that's just what we call pillow talk,
baby. That's all.

337
00:51:24,416 --> 00:51:26,204
It was more than that!

338
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,007
I still have faith in thee.

339
00:51:30,624 --> 00:51:33,722
I still believe that thou wilt stay
and save us.

340
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:40,148
Coward.

341
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,567
- Help me!
- Sheila!

342
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,108
Hold your arms! You'll hit the girl.

343
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,194
My sword.

344
00:52:32,064 --> 00:52:33,274
Damn you!

345
00:52:51,295 --> 00:52:52,724
Dig, damn you!

346
00:52:53,952 --> 00:52:55,708
Dig faster!

347
00:52:55,968 --> 00:52:59,546
I shall command every worm-infested
son of a bitch that ever died in battle.

348
00:52:59,616 --> 00:53:01,110
- Thank you, sir.
- You there!

349
00:53:01,184 --> 00:53:02,744
Handsomely, now!

350
00:53:02,848 --> 00:53:05,531
We shall storm their castle
and get my book.

351
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,829
Hoist, you damnable varlets!

352
00:53:12,511 --> 00:53:15,610
Welcome back to the land of the living.

353
00:53:16,288 --> 00:53:18,776
Now pick up a shovel and get digging!

354
00:53:20,863 --> 00:53:22,489
Bring on the wench!

355
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,534
Get down there!

356
00:53:33,951 --> 00:53:35,774
Give me some sugar, baby.

357
00:53:41,696 --> 00:53:45,373
Now ain't you the sweet little thing?

358
00:53:48,576 --> 00:53:51,325
Don't touch me, you foul thing!

359
00:54:03,264 --> 00:54:06,330
Come on. That's it.

360
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,298
We got plans for you, girly-girl! Move!

361
00:54:24,032 --> 00:54:27,327
Bust your bones, you dig up holes, dogs!
Get thee hence!

362
00:54:36,832 --> 00:54:38,490
A scout approaches!

363
00:54:45,504 --> 00:54:46,933
Get his horse!

364
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:48,920
Arise.

365
00:54:48,992 --> 00:54:52,636
My Lord, an army of the dead gather
in the wilderness and approach the castle.

366
00:54:52,703 --> 00:54:55,037
- How far from here?
- But two days ride.

367
00:54:55,168 --> 00:54:58,746
- These winged ones are only the first.
- Perhaps we should leave soon.

368
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:01,335
- We'll be safe in the mountains.
- Yes. We must flee!

369
00:55:01,407 --> 00:55:04,342
- It is written. It's been foretold.
- They'll take our souls.

370
00:55:04,416 --> 00:55:06,303
- I'm afraid!
- Every one of our souls!

371
00:55:06,368 --> 00:55:07,961
I don't want to die.

372
00:55:08,896 --> 00:55:12,692
That's it! Go ahead and run!

373
00:55:13,696 --> 00:55:17,209
Run home and cry to mama! Me?

374
00:55:18,623 --> 00:55:20,314
I'm through running!

375
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:24,789
I say we stay here and fight it out.

376
00:55:25,311 --> 00:55:29,272
Are all men from the future
loudmouth braggarts?

377
00:55:29,664 --> 00:55:32,413
No. Just me, baby.

378
00:55:33,056 --> 00:55:34,004
Just me.

379
00:55:35,072 --> 00:55:38,487
How will we fight an army of the dead
at our castle walls?

380
00:55:38,816 --> 00:55:43,453
How will you fight that? More words?
Most of our people have already fled.

381
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,535
We are but 60 men.

382
00:55:46,688 --> 00:55:50,168
Then we'll get Henry the Red
and his men to fight with us.

383
00:55:52,672 --> 00:55:56,534
Now! Who's with me?

384
00:56:10,144 --> 00:56:11,867
I'll stand by you.

385
00:56:14,015 --> 00:56:18,041
- You can count on my steel.
- I'll offer up my courage!

386
00:56:18,368 --> 00:56:21,434
- Me sword's by your side!
- I'm with you!

387
00:56:21,983 --> 00:56:23,925
I'll bend my bow to your will, sir.

388
00:56:28,128 --> 00:56:31,161
Hail! Hail! Hail!

389
00:56:47,642 --> 00:56:51,472
Well, my dear, say hello to the boys.

390
00:56:57,723 --> 00:57:00,112
There's a sight for sore bones.

391
00:57:04,347 --> 00:57:08,853
I may be bad, but I feel good.

392
00:57:10,682 --> 00:57:13,203
- Who rules?
- It is you, my lord.

393
00:57:13,306 --> 00:57:14,735
To the castle!

394
00:57:17,402 --> 00:57:19,158
- But the men are afraid!
- It's too heavy! Now, that's enough.

395
00:57:19,226 --> 00:57:21,299
Quit your bellyaching!

396
00:57:22,331 --> 00:57:26,324
I know you're scared. We're all scared.

397
00:57:27,739 --> 00:57:30,160
But that doesn't mean we're cowards.

398
00:57:30,779 --> 00:57:33,561
We can take these Deadites,
we can take them!

399
00:57:35,163 --> 00:57:36,504
With science.

400
00:57:40,507 --> 00:57:42,295
Hurry up, now!

401
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:45,305
Come on, fellas! Push! Heave ho!

402
00:58:35,131 --> 00:58:36,440
Tilt. Tilt.

403
00:58:37,755 --> 00:58:39,129
Okay, in, in.

404
00:59:23,035 --> 00:59:26,417
They're coming! The Deadites approach!

405
00:59:31,835 --> 00:59:35,130
Quickly now, you worthless fools!
They'll be on us anon!

406
00:59:35,259 --> 00:59:36,688
Come on, guys!

407
00:59:40,763 --> 00:59:44,723
The moment of truth is almost here.
You men better not fail me now.

408
01:00:00,475 --> 01:00:02,580
There's so damned many of them.

409
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:16,977
I need more men.

410
01:00:58,235 --> 01:01:02,032
Battle stations! Get those rocks up!
On the double!

411
01:01:02,394 --> 01:01:06,322
Ready the catapults!
By God, let's give them what for!

412
01:01:15,578 --> 01:01:16,625
Halt!

413
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:21,269
- Looking glass!
- Aye, sire.

414
01:02:28,763 --> 01:02:31,097
Once I possess the Necronomicon...

415
01:02:32,282 --> 01:02:37,072
...I shall rule, and you shall be my queen.

416
01:02:50,874 --> 01:02:53,689
My lord, we are positioned on both fronts.

417
01:02:53,754 --> 01:02:56,983
Fine. Where are they keeping my book?

418
01:02:57,338 --> 01:03:00,088
There, my lord.
Beyond the drawbridge in the second wall.

419
01:03:00,155 --> 01:03:02,097
That would be the safest place.

420
01:03:02,171 --> 01:03:06,677
I will not allow anything to keep me
from possessing that Necronomicon.

421
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:12,469
Now, bring me forth into that castle.

422
01:03:12,827 --> 01:03:15,893
- Forward!
- Forward!

423
01:03:15,994 --> 01:03:19,704
Cry havoc, and let loose the dogs of war!

424
01:03:20,282 --> 01:03:23,064
To the castle!

425
01:03:26,971 --> 01:03:28,181
Excellent.

426
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:33,433
Death to the mortals!

427
01:03:36,506 --> 01:03:37,651
Arrows!

428
01:03:38,203 --> 01:03:39,250
Bows.

429
01:03:39,963 --> 01:03:41,010
Load!

430
01:03:42,714 --> 01:03:43,729
Draw!

431
01:03:53,819 --> 01:03:55,412
Torch boy!

432
01:04:35,963 --> 01:04:37,108
Steady.

433
01:04:43,802 --> 01:04:44,850
Fire!

434
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:50,036
Advance, you demons! Advance!

435
01:05:10,363 --> 01:05:13,210
Yeah, baby!

436
01:05:20,155 --> 01:05:21,431
All right!

437
01:05:22,554 --> 01:05:25,140
- Retreat!
- Let's get the hell out of here!

438
01:05:34,938 --> 01:05:36,149
Damn him!

439
01:05:36,987 --> 01:05:39,638
The sortie on the second flank will stand.

440
01:05:39,803 --> 01:05:41,264
It must!

441
01:05:42,587 --> 01:05:46,132
Sire, there's a second division
approaching from the south.

442
01:05:46,747 --> 01:05:49,300
Ram the gates!

443
01:05:53,499 --> 01:05:54,775
Catapults!

444
01:05:55,194 --> 01:05:57,234
Catapults! South!

445
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:07,544
- We'll crush them!
- We'll strike again!

446
01:06:19,483 --> 01:06:20,912
Fire!

447
01:06:28,186 --> 01:06:29,463
What the blazes?

448
01:06:37,211 --> 01:06:39,120
- Watch out!
- Make way!

449
01:06:45,722 --> 01:06:47,031
Seek cover!

450
01:06:56,219 --> 01:06:58,902
You miserable bags of bones!

451
01:06:59,066 --> 01:07:02,514
Pick yourselves up and sally for...

452
01:07:03,610 --> 01:07:04,887
Sally for...

453
01:07:06,075 --> 01:07:08,017
Sally forth.

454
01:07:11,611 --> 01:07:13,815
Come on, you miserable wretches!

455
01:07:24,026 --> 01:07:25,074
Forward!

456
01:07:27,706 --> 01:07:30,095
Buttress that door! Now!

457
01:07:46,331 --> 01:07:47,443
Rocks!

458
01:07:48,634 --> 01:07:49,747
Damn you!

459
01:07:53,339 --> 01:07:55,346
That's gotta hurt!

460
01:07:55,739 --> 01:07:57,048
You cretins!

461
01:07:57,370 --> 01:07:58,515
Arrows!

462
01:07:59,675 --> 01:08:00,623
Fire!

463
01:08:05,883 --> 01:08:08,468
We'll ram it down the bastard's throat!

464
01:08:09,819 --> 01:08:10,866
Fire!

465
01:08:16,091 --> 01:08:18,611
South flank, to the western wall! Now!

466
01:08:19,163 --> 01:08:22,643
Where is Henry the Red?
I told you he would not come!

467
01:08:22,715 --> 01:08:27,319
Keep your sardine can on, bucket-head!
I said he'll be here, he'll be here!

468
01:08:27,707 --> 01:08:30,292
I think he will not. But know this.

469
01:08:30,683 --> 01:08:35,320
No matter how this battle fares,
I was wrong to think you a coward.

470
01:08:40,826 --> 01:08:43,510
We've broken through! The castle is ours!

471
01:08:48,283 --> 01:08:50,836
Kill the mortals!

472
01:08:55,387 --> 01:08:56,848
All right, men!

473
01:09:25,723 --> 01:09:28,919
They've breached the first wall!
What next?

474
01:09:35,611 --> 01:09:37,945
We are deserted!

475
01:09:38,939 --> 01:09:41,360
Fall back! Man the parapet!

476
01:09:41,723 --> 01:09:43,283
Protect the book!

477
01:09:44,538 --> 01:09:46,065
God save us all.

478
01:09:46,906 --> 01:09:50,616
Up the ladders, lads!
To the safety of the parapets!

479
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:03,414
Say hello to the 21st century.

480
01:10:15,962 --> 01:10:18,450
Come on! I got plenty for everybody!

481
01:10:27,003 --> 01:10:29,491
- How do you like this?
- Play dead!

482
01:10:32,123 --> 01:10:34,425
It's the one in the cart we want. Get him!

483
01:10:51,771 --> 01:10:53,713
Sayonara, sucker!

484
01:11:00,122 --> 01:11:01,235
Why, you...

485
01:11:03,162 --> 01:11:05,529
You can run, but you can't hide!

486
01:11:30,715 --> 01:11:31,860
Sheila?

487
01:11:56,154 --> 01:11:58,543
- We've secured the courtyard, my lord.
- Excellent.

488
01:11:59,386 --> 01:12:02,037
Now I will have that book.
Storm the walls!

489
01:12:02,491 --> 01:12:03,538
Ladders!

490
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:07,320
Come on, you bony devils! Hurry up!
Or I'll send you to the glue factory!

491
01:12:07,387 --> 01:12:08,499
Elmer!

492
01:12:09,275 --> 01:12:10,682
To the walls!

493
01:12:13,819 --> 01:12:16,307
I'll slice you to ribbons! No, no!

494
01:12:39,995 --> 01:12:41,653
Wait! Look out!

495
01:12:48,858 --> 01:12:51,892
- Hey, you're mine, sweetie!
- Get off of her!

496
01:12:58,810 --> 01:13:00,021
Damn you!

497
01:13:00,699 --> 01:13:05,074
Defend the Necronomicon, lads!
Or perish in the devil's fire!

498
01:13:09,563 --> 01:13:12,149
- My lord.
- Stay with the book!

499
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:14,135
The book will be ours!

500
01:13:35,642 --> 01:13:36,624
Hello!

501
01:13:46,714 --> 01:13:48,275
The book is mine!

502
01:13:52,730 --> 01:13:54,137
There you go!

503
01:14:02,107 --> 01:14:04,049
I'll cut your gizzard out.

504
01:14:04,987 --> 01:14:06,416
Where'd he go?

505
01:14:17,082 --> 01:14:18,489
Come to Papa!

506
01:14:19,706 --> 01:14:20,884
Get him!

507
01:14:49,787 --> 01:14:53,977
Crazy bitch, get off me!
You're tearing my eyes out!

508
01:14:55,195 --> 01:14:56,471
You witch!

509
01:15:03,035 --> 01:15:03,983
Right.

510
01:15:11,227 --> 01:15:13,267
You found me beautiful once.

511
01:15:13,914 --> 01:15:16,336
Honey, you got real ugly.

512
01:15:34,875 --> 01:15:36,402
There we are.

513
01:15:44,923 --> 01:15:46,745
You wanna play rough?

514
01:15:57,626 --> 01:15:58,804
All right!

515
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:22,803
You're going down!

516
01:16:23,867 --> 01:16:26,256
- I'm going up!
- I'm coming for you!

517
01:16:56,347 --> 01:16:57,426
Get him!

518
01:16:59,770 --> 01:17:00,883
Excuse me!

519
01:17:01,019 --> 01:17:02,775
Come on! All right!

520
01:17:05,274 --> 01:17:08,209
You're pissin' me off,
you ugly son of a bitch!

521
01:17:10,811 --> 01:17:11,793
No!

522
01:17:29,467 --> 01:17:32,217
I'll spoil those good looks!

523
01:17:35,194 --> 01:17:36,601
Backstabber!

524
01:17:41,947 --> 01:17:43,256
Hold still!

525
01:17:57,595 --> 01:17:59,569
Tallyho!

526
01:18:06,714 --> 01:18:11,286
- We can't hold the battlements!
- We will hold! We must protect the book!

527
01:18:11,547 --> 01:18:14,035
Where's Henry the Red? Why's he not...

528
01:18:15,706 --> 01:18:18,041
We are deserted!

529
01:18:19,387 --> 01:18:20,980
We're overwhelmed!

530
01:18:42,299 --> 01:18:44,437
I got a bone to pick with you.

531
01:18:45,051 --> 01:18:46,229
Come on!

532
01:18:52,954 --> 01:18:54,994
I'll slice your gizzard open!

533
01:19:11,419 --> 01:19:12,880
Now you're mine!

534
01:19:19,611 --> 01:19:20,593
No!

535
01:19:33,722 --> 01:19:34,671
Why, you...

536
01:19:34,747 --> 01:19:38,937
Let go of the sword!
I'll cut your throat out if I get the chance.

537
01:20:00,698 --> 01:20:02,225
I have the book!

538
01:20:08,155 --> 01:20:09,878
I possess the Necronomicon!

539
01:20:09,946 --> 01:20:13,721
I've crushed your pathetic army!
Now I'll have my vengeance!

540
01:20:13,786 --> 01:20:17,528
The Red! The Red!
Duke Henry and his men have come!

541
01:20:17,626 --> 01:20:21,783
For king and castle! Cry havoc!

542
01:20:22,395 --> 01:20:26,966
Blows, blood, and death!

543
01:20:30,587 --> 01:20:32,113
We are saved!

544
01:20:42,586 --> 01:20:46,481
Onward, valiant cousins!
Their ranks are broke!

545
01:20:47,835 --> 01:20:49,177
Bloody hell!

546
01:20:50,043 --> 01:20:54,134
You've spoiled my plan for conquest!
And now you're going to die!

547
01:20:54,747 --> 01:20:57,813
Buckle up, bonehead!
Because you're going for a ride!

548
01:21:12,539 --> 01:21:14,066
Victory is ours!

549
01:21:39,899 --> 01:21:43,194
- lf it's a fight you want...
- Well, start something!

550
01:21:43,578 --> 01:21:46,448
- Stand ready, lads!
- We're ready for you!

551
01:22:37,178 --> 01:22:38,640
Move yourself, lad.

552
01:22:38,971 --> 01:22:40,497
- Your hand, man.
- Hey, Henry.

553
01:22:40,570 --> 01:22:42,458
- The debt's paid.
- You had us going.

554
01:22:42,523 --> 01:22:43,799
- Milady.
- Arthur.

555
01:22:43,867 --> 01:22:46,452
- Well won, my friend.
- We've won the day!

556
01:22:52,763 --> 01:22:56,756
We're brothers now!
A new kingdom shall be born!

557
01:22:59,674 --> 01:23:03,733
The book tells us that each drop
allows a man to sleep for a century.

558
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:08,338
Swallow six drops,
thou shall awaken in thine own time.

559
01:24:10,075 --> 01:24:11,766
God bless you, sire.

560
01:24:51,611 --> 01:24:53,171
Six drops.

561
01:24:56,059 --> 01:25:00,215
One, two, three, four...

562
01:25:01,211 --> 01:25:02,159
...five.

563
01:25:09,978 --> 01:25:11,320
Five.

564
01:25:12,762 --> 01:25:13,711
Six.

565
01:26:28,602 --> 01:26:29,912
I'm home.

566
01:26:48,602 --> 01:26:50,391
Manufactured products!

567
01:27:03,803 --> 01:27:06,673
God! No! No!

568
01:27:06,971 --> 01:27:09,491
I slept too long!
