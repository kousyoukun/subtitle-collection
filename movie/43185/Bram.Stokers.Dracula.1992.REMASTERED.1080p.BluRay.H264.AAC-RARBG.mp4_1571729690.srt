他挚爱的新娘伊丽莎白
his bride Elisabeta whom he prized above all things on Earth...

10
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,480
知道他将与强敌对阵
knew that he must face an insurmountable force...

11
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,150
可能一去不返
from which he might never return.

12
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,940
(赞美主)

13
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,950
(我已获胜)

14
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,620

散布德古拉阵亡的谣言

(她的灵魂不能升天堂)

24
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,770
(要受天谴)

25
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,780
(这是神的律令)

26
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,450
(这就是我捍卫教会的报偿吗?)

27
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,520
(放肆)

28
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,330
(我唾弃上帝)

29
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,860
(我将死后复生)

30
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,610
(用尽邪恶力量为她复仇)

31
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,430
(血是生命泉源)

32
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,360

37
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,750
我都照你的吩咐做了,主人

00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,770
当你论功行赏时

你的慷慨会使我受益无穷

伦费发狂了
Gone mad. Renfield is deranged.

46
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,520
心智丧失
He's lost his greedy mind, poor chap.

47
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,590
替个外国人德古拉伯爵理财
I want you to take over for his foreign client this rather eccentric Count Dracula.

48
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,930
他要在伦敦近郊买房产
- He's buying up property around London. - Of course, sir.

49
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,870
我会转告伯爵,谢谢你的委派
I'll attend to the count. Thank you for your confidence.

这是你的大好良机,哈克

但你必须立刻前往川索凡尼亚

终生难遇的机会
Opportunities such as this come but once in a lifetime.

53
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,180
那当然

54
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,010
伦费先生在川索凡尼亚怎么了
If I may inquire...what, in fact, happened to Mr. Renfield in Transylvania?

55
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,020
没什么
Nothing. Nothing.

56
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,250
私人问题

57

59

我们等了那么久
We've waited this long, haven't we?

60
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,600
我一回来就结婚
We can be married when I return.

61
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,000
好吧
Of course.

我会写信的

63
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,680

今晨离开布达佩斯
Left Budapest early this morning.

68
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,820
依我看...
The impression I had was that we were leaving the west...

69
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,030
我们是往东欧前进(强纳生哈克之日记)
and entering the east.

70
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,510
这一带是罗马尼亚最东部
The district I am to enter is in the extreme east of the country...

71
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,210
摩达维亚、布卡维纳及川索凡尼亚
just on the borders of three states...Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina...

72
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,410
喀尔巴阡山交界处
in the midst of the Carpathian Mountains...

73
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,910
欧洲最荒凉无名的一区
one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe.

74
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,680
朋友

欢迎到喀尔巴阡山

77
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,930
我的马车
At the Borgo Pass...

78
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,430
将在波戈隘口等你
my carriage will await you and bring you to me.

79
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:06,210
深信你一路顺畅
I trust yourjourney from London has been a happy one...

80
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,700
并希望你在我国

81
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,370

00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,890
亲爱的强纳生离去近一周(米娜墨瑞之日记)
My Jonathan has been gone almost a week.

86
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:35,760
我虽因不能立刻成婚感到失望

87
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,230
仍为他出使重要任务而高兴
I am happy that he got sent on this important assignment.

88
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,900
我渴望他的音讯

89
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,180
到外国一定很有趣

90
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:51,710
不知我们能否一同出国游览
I wonder if we... I mean Jonathan and l...shall ever see them together.

91
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,470
我们来早了,还没人来
We're early, driver. No one is here.

92
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,670
(死人才走的快)

93
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,910
城堡远不远?
I say, is the castle far?

94
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,400
欢迎光临寒舍
Welcome to my home.

95
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:56,000
轻松自在地进来
Enter freely of your own will...

96
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,830
将你的欢乐留下
and leave some of the happiness you bring.

97
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,840
德古拉伯爵
Count Dracula?

98
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,940
在下就是
I am...

99
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,000
德古拉

100
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,740
寒舍蓬壁生辉了,哈克先生
And I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house.

101

请进
Come in.

102
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,540
请恕我
You will, I trust, excuse me that I...

103
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,370
不能奉陪
do not join you.

104
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,950
我已经吃过了
But I have already dined.

105
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,280
而且我从不喝
And I never drink...

106
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,280
葡萄酒
wine.

107
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,560
你的祖先? 五官很像
An ancestor? I see a resemblance.

108
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,540
德古拉的徽记
The Order of the Dracul.

109
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,900
是条龙
The Dragon.

110
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,140
古代有个社
An ancient society...

111
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,410
我的祖先宣誓入会
pledging my forefathers...

112
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,650
保护教会抵御外侮
to defend their church against all enemies of Christ.

113
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,590
结果却和教会
That relationship was not entirely...

114
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,180
闹僵
successful.

115
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,130
是吗?
Oh, yes.

116
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,870
这不是开玩笑的事
It is no laughing matter.

117
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,970
我们德古家值得骄傲
We Draculs have a right to be proud.

118
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,810
不论阿提拉大帝如何残暴
What devil or witch was ever so great as Attila...

119
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,810
我也流着相同的血液
whose blood flows in these veins?

120
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,380
血！
Blood...

121
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,560
这年头成宝了
is too precious a thing in these times.

122
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,500
杀伐的年代已过去
The warlike days are over.

123
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,240
我家族的光荣战迹
The victories of my great race...

124
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,340
只成为故事
are but a tale to be told.

125
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:29,090
我是最后一名子嗣
I am the last of my kind.

126
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:34,930
恕我无知,伯爵
I have offended you with my ignorance, Count.

127
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,530
原谅我
Forgive me.

128
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:56,080
我渴望在伦敦拥挤的街道行走
I do so long to go through the crowded streets...of your mighty London...

129
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,120
混在匆忙的人群中
to be in the midst of the whirl and the rush of humanity...

130
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,450
分享它的生命力
to share its life...

131
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,960
它的改变
its changes,

132
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,560
及死亡
its death.

133
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:09,560
完成了 伯爵
There. You, Count, are...

134
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,130
你是卡费教堂的所有人
are the owner of Carfax Abbey at Purfleet.

135
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,630
恭喜
Congratulations.

136
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:22,040
贵公司对你赞许有加
Your firm writes most highly...of your talents.

137
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,640
他们说你的品味
They say you are a man of good...

138
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,410
很高

139
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,070
还说你能力不输给
And that you are a worthy substitute...

140
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,410
前任...
to your predecessor,

141
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,980
伦费先生
Mr. Renfield.

142
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,990
你可以相信我
You may rely on me, Count.

143
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,490
恕我好奇
Forgive my curiosity, but why ten houses...

144
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:45,060
为何十所房子都买在伦敦附近
in such precise locations around London?

145
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,630
炒地皮?
Is it to raise the market value?

146
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,200
你相信宿命吗
Do you believe in destiny?

147
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,040
时间都可因...
That even the powers of time...

148
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,070
某一...
can be altered for

149
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,650
目的而改变?
a single purpose?

150
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:19,570
找到真爱的人才是...
The luckiest man who walks on this Earth...is the one who finds...

151
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,230
最幸运的人
true love.

152
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,990
你找到米娜了
You found Mina.

153
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,830
我以为丢了呢
I thought she was lost.

154
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,840
我回去后就结婚
We're to be married as soon as I return.

155
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,510
你结婚了吗 伯爵?
Are you married, Count?

156
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,170
先生
Sir...

157
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,780
你结婚了吗?
are you married?

158
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,680
结过一次
I was married once.

159
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,920
多年以前
Ages ago, it seems.

160
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,590
她死了
She died.

161
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,750
真令人难过
I'm very sorry.

162
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,030
是她命好
She was fortunate.

163
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:59,030
我一生凄凉
My life, at its best, is misery.

164
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,870
她一定会是个贤妻
She will no doubt make a devoted wife.

165
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,110
而你是个忠实的丈夫
And you a faithful husband.

166
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,480
来
Come.

167
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,990
写信给你公司
Write now, my friend, to your firm...

168
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,560
与心爱的人,说你要...
and to any loved ones, and say that it shall please you...

169
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:28,060
陪我住一个月
to stay with me...until a month from now.

170
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,000
一个月?
A month?

171
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,430
你要我待那么久?
Do you wish me to stay so long?

172
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,680
不可以拒绝
I will take no refusal.

173
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,290
1897年5月3O日,日记
Diary, 30th of May, 1897.

174
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,820
强纳生不愿我在他出差时与露西同住
I know that Jonathan does not want me to stay here with Lucy while he is away.

175
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:05,130
他怕我习惯威斯丁家的富贵后
He thinks that if I become accustomed to the wealth of the Westenra family...

176
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,310
便不肯当法律事务所职员的妻子
I will not be content as the wife of a mere clerk in a law firm.

177
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,380
但我和露西自幼是好友
But Lucy and I have been friends since we were children...

178
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,880
她不在乎我只是个教师
and she has never minded that I am only a schoolmistress.

179
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,830
好恶心
How disgustingly awful.

180
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,020
米娜
Mina!

181
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,460
(一千零一夜)

182
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,160
米娜
Mina!

183
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,160
米娜,你老在工作
Oh, Mina, you're always working.

184
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:46,240
你那有野心的强纳生逼你学打字?
Is your ambitious Jon Harker...forcing you to learn that ridiculous machine?

185
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,680
他也能逼你
When he could be forcing you to perform...

186
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:54,080
低级热情演出
unspeakable acts of desperate passion on the parlor floor.

187
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:58,020
露西,你不该这样说我未婚夫
Lucy, really.You shouldn't talk about my fiance in such a way.

188
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,120
婚姻不只是肉体享乐
There's more to marriage than carnal pleasure.

189
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,190
喔 米娜  是哦！
Oh, Mina. So I see.

190
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,360
要多的多
Much, much more.

191
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,190
那是
That's...

192
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,370
这是什么?露西
What is it, Lucy?

193
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,210
我看不懂
Because I don't understand it.

194
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,140
男女真的...
Can a man and woman really do...

195
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,150
这么做吗?
that?

196
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,750
我昨晚就做过
I did, only last night.

197
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,120
骗人!你没有
Fibber. You did not.

198
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,850
我有
Yes, I did.

199
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,980
在我的梦里
Well, in my dreams.

200
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,490
强纳生有这么棒吧?
Jonathan measures up, doesn't he?

201
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,000
你可以告诉我的
You can tell Lucy.

202
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,440
我们只接过吻
We've kissed. That's all.

203
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,660
他觉得娶不起我
He thinks he's too poor to marry me.

204
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,180
更糟的是我到你的华宅看你
And it's all the worse now that I'm here visiting you at Hillingham...

205
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,900
我的富有朋友
my rich friend.

206
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:56,410
却没人向我求过婚
Yes, but not even one marriage proposal.

207
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,080
我快满20了
And here I am, almost 20...

208
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,190
是个老处女了
practically a hag.

209
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:10,020
昆西摩里斯先生到
Mr. Quincey P. Morris.

210
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,100
你看
Oh, look.

211
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,360
那是什么人
What is that?

212
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,930
德州人
A Texan.

213
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,930
昆西摩里斯
Quincey P. Morris.

214
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,940
他好年轻稚气
He's so young and fresh...

215
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,370
像我胯间的野种马
like a wild stallion between my legs.

216
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,380
你真下流
You're positively indecent.

217
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,540
我只是知道男人想要什么
I just know what men desire.

218
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,450
看着
Watch.

00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,040
露西小姐
Miss Lucy.

221
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,720
你像春雨般清新
Why, you're as fresh as the spring rain.

222
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,380
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

223
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,280
昆西
Quincey.

224
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,030
求求你让我摸摸
Please let me touch it.

225
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,120
好...
It's so...

226
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,230
大

小女孩

228
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,740
我亲爱的小女孩
Oh, my dear, sweet little girl.

229
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,080
我握着你的手,你也吻过我
I hold your hand...- and you've kissed me.

230
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,240

231
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,140
爱你深似海

我的达令,小宝贝
Poor little baby.

233
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,490
小猫咪过来
My kitten, come over here.

234
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,820
来,吻一个就会好了
Come over here and I'll kiss it better.

235

我可怜的小花

236
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,590
我可怜的小郎中,小医生

240
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,200
阿瑟

241
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,930
亲爱的
Oh, my darling.

242
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,280
你气色真好

243
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,940
抱歉弄坏你的帽子

244
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,970
好美 这是我的妖女装

245
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,020
真的吗?
Is it really?

246
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,110
露西纯洁有德
Lucy is a pure and virtuous girl...

247
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:45,850
但她言语大胆真叫我震惊
but I admit that her free way of speaking shocks me sometimes.

248
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:51,960
强纳生说贵族都是口无遮拦
Jonathan says it is a defect of the aristocracy...that they say what they please.

249
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,870
但我崇拜露西
The truth is that I admire Lucy,

250
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,800
难怪男人爱她
and I'm not surprised that men flock around her.

251
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,140
我希望我像她一样漂亮迷人
I wish I were as pretty and as adored as she.

252
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,660
他是怎样的人?
What manner of man is this?

253
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,720
亚伦费,霍汤公司得力干部
R.M. Renfield, successful solicitor...

in the firm of Hawkins and Thompkins...respected member of the Lord Nugent's Windem Club...

吃开胃菜?西渥先生
Would you care for an hors d'oeuvre, Dr. Seward...

261
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,030
还是点心?
or a canape?

262
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,870
不了,谢谢,伦费先生
No, thank you, Mr. Renfield.

263
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,530
今晚感觉如何?
How are you feeling tonight?

264
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:11,270
比你好,单相思医生
Far better than you, my lovesick doctor.

265
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,270
你对我的私生活有兴趣
Is my personal life of interest to you?

266
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,940
对,我对所有人都有兴趣
Of course it is. All life interests me.

267
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,880
你的食物,伦费先生
Your diet, Mr. Renfield, is disgusting.

268
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,380
真恶心
Actually,

269
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:23,380
实际上很营养
they're perfectly nutritious.

270
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,890
我所摄取的生命
You see, each life that I ingest...

271
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:29,290
会带给我生命
gives back life to me.

272
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,120
苍蝇带给你生命?
A fly gives you life?

273
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,130
没错
Certainly.

274
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:42,000
叫我吃一般食物
But you might as well ask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chopsticks...

275
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,810
比用筷子夹分子还难
than to interest me in a lesser carnivore.

276
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:48,470
我要为你发明疯子新分类法

00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,490
吃！
Oh, yes.

281
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,590
你刚说麻雀吗?
Did you say sparrows?

282
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,750
体型大点的
Something larger, perhaps?

283
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,830
对
Oh, yes.

284
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,000

285
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,770
求求你
I beg you.

286
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,770
一只...
A little, sleek... a playful kitten.

287
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,510

Something I can teach. Something I can feed.

288
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,670
可喂食的小猫 小猫而已嘛
No one would refuse me a kitten.

289
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:24,110
成猫好吗
Wouldn't you prefer a cat?

290
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,780

525
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:56,090
老实说我很惶惑
Well, frankly, Arthur, I'm confounded.

526
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:59,020
你还在替露西小姐担心
Jack, are you still broodin' over Miss Lucy?

527
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:02,520
我看她神智错乱
I can only conclude it must be something mental.

528
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:06,030
胡说  你听到没

我也不明白
I'm at a loss, I admit.

532

我已拍电报给埃布尔汉梵海辛精神哲学家
I've taken the liberty of cabling Abraham Van Helsing...the metaphysician/philosopher.

533
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,230
我看他是个巫医
Sounds like a goddamn witch doctor to me, Jack.

534
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:38,060
他是疑难杂症权威

536

这哪叫科学
How can you call this science?

542
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:39,360
居里夫人会同意这看法吗?
Do you think Madam Curie would invite such comparisons?Really.

543
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:45,130
我不该来的

我跨越...时间的瀚海来寻你

551
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:16,130
各位来宾不要惊慌

捕兽师自会处理

要吸体重十倍的鲜血
consume ten times its own weight in fresh blood each day...

560
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:55,280
否则它自己会死

561
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:06,320
小混球
Cute little vermin, ja?

562
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:10,260
我们研究血液及血液疾病
Blood and the diseases of the blood...

563
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,000
如梅毒
such as syphilis, they concern us here.

564
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,370
性病“爱神之疾”
The very name "venereal diseases"...the diseases of Venus,

565
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:20,200
非常传神
imputes to them divine origin.

566
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:23,940
牵涉到基督文明
And they are involved in that sex problem about which...

567
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:28,280
对伦理与性的观念
the ethics and ideals of Christian civilization are concerned.

568
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:33,150
其实 文明与梅毒几乎同步发展
In fact, civilization and syphilization have advanced together.

569
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,350
这是什么
What is this?

570
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:39,290

德古拉把我丢给这些妖女
Dracula has left me with these women...

576
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:08,520

these devils of the pit.

577
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:11,090
让我气息犹存
They drain my blood to keep me weak...

578
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:13,590
却逃不了
barely alive so I cannot escape.

579
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,100
我今天尝试最后一次逃到水边
I will try one last time today to escape to the water.

580
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:20,100
一定有路可以通到河边
There must be passageway to the river...

581
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,670
逃出这受诅之地
and then away from this cursed land...

582
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:25,840
及披着人皮的群魔
where the devil and his children still walk with earthly feet.

583
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:38,550
我正式宣布
For the record, I do attest...

584
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:41,890
此刻亚拉汉梵海辛
that at this point, I, Abraham Van Helsing...

585
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:45,760
亲自调查这些怪事
became personally involved in these strange events.

586
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:43,180
梵海辛教授,你果然来了
Professor Van Helsing, how good of you to come.

587
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:50,530
我一向乐于帮助需要我的朋友
I always come to my friends in need when they call me.

588
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,520
把病情详细告诉我
So, Jack, tell me everything about your case.

589
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:56,690
她有一般贫血症状
She has all the usual physical anemic signs.

590
00:58:56,830 --> 00:58:58,820
血液分析正常
Her blood analyzes normal, and yet it is not.

591
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:02,270
但事实上她持续失血
She manifests continued blood loss.

592
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:03,670
我找不出原因
I cannot trace the cause.

593
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:05,170
失血?怎么会
Blood loss? How?

594
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:16,320
把门关上
My God, close the doors!

595
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:28,990
天啊
My God...

596
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:31,000
她还是个孩子
she's only a child.

597
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:34,300
是啊
Ja.

598
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:37,070
老天！
My God.

599
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:42,410
不得延误立刻输血,脱掉外套
There's no time to lose. There must be a transfusion at once.Take off your coat.

600
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,610
还会绑止血带吧
Remember how to tie a tourniquet?Or have you forgotten?

601
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,080
你精通输血?
You perfected a procedure?

602
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:51,690
精通?不,我只会蓝斯坦法
Perfected? No. I've only experimented.Landsteiner's method.

603
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,680
只替动物输过,山羊、绵羊啦
Animals, goats, sheeps.

604
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:01,160
若血清有溶血现象红血球会破裂
If hemolysis occurs in the blood donor serum...her red blood cells will explode.

605
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,590
她就会死,把管子拿好
She will die. Take this tube.

606
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,670
你们在搞什么
What in God's name is going on up here?

607
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:11,430
这位是梵海辛教授
This is Professor Van Helsing, Art.

608
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:12,910
他把露西怎么了
What the hell is he doing to Lucy?

609
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:14,270
救她的命
He's trying to save her life.

610
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:15,140
老天！
Good God!

611
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:16,410
你是她的未婚夫
You're the fiance?

612
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,640
请让开
Please.

613
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:19,610
请！
Please.

614
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:25,280
外套脱掉,她生命垂危须输血
Take off your coat. This young lady's very ill. She's dying.She wants blood and blood she must have.

615
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:27,190
外套脱掉！
Take off your coat.

616
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:28,950
袖子卷起来
Roll up your sleeve, Art.

617
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:32,720
老天！快！
- Oh, God. - Quickly, quickly.

618
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,290
卷起来
Roll it up!

619
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:36,460
可能有点痛
This may hurt a little, Art.

620
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:52,550
请原谅我  她是我的命,最后一滴血都行
Forgive me. My life is hers. I would give my last drop of blood to save her.

621
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:53,810
最后一滴?
Your last drop?

622
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:56,810
谢谢,欢迎你
Thank you.You are very welcome here.

623
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:58,960
我不要那么多
I don't ask as much as that.

624
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:00,150
目前还不要
 Not yet.

625
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,690
握住她的手
Hold her hand.

626
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:18,540
杰克...她输了两人份的血
Jack, that poor creature has had the blood of two men put into her already.

627
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:22,300
妈呀!她装不了那么多血
Man alive. Her whole body couldn't hold that much blood.

628
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,680
露西的血去哪呢
What took it out?

629
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,780
问的好,摩里斯先生
That's a good question, Mr. Morris.

630
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:35,990
喉咙那些痕迹?
Those marks on her throat...

631
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:40,660
不是疾病或伤痕,而是失血处
no disease, no trituration...I am sure the blood loss occurred there.

632
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:43,120
血去哪呢?
Oh? Where did the blood go?

633
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:46,570
你以前是个细心的学生
You were once a careful student, Jack.

634
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,740
用脑呀,血去哪了?告诉我!
Use your brain! Where did the blood go?Tell me!

635
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:53,470
床铺上有血   没错
- The bed would be covered in blood. - Exactly.

636
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:58,470
你没观察到不可知的现象
You do not let your eyes see nor your ears hear...that which you cannot account for.

637
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:02,640
有异物吸她的血后飞走?
Something just went up there, sucked it out of her and flew away?

638
01:02:04,350 --> 01:02:05,910
对 有何不可?
Ja. Why not?

639
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:10,360
高明,真高明
That's brilliant. That's absolutely brilliant.

640
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:14,690
请问神医,露西是怎么了?
Will one of you learned doctors... or whatever you are...kindly tell me what is going on with my Lucy?

641
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:18,600
杰克,你是个科学家
Jack, you are a scientist.

642
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:23,440
宇宙中可有你不明了的事实?
Do you not think there are things in this universe you cannot understand...and which are true...

643
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:24,970
像是催眠
mesmerism, hypnotism?

644
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:26,840
你和夏卡已证实了
You and Charcot have proved hypnotism.

645
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:29,770
实体与灵体
Materialization, astral bodies.

646
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:39,790
教授?
Professor?

647
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,190
他去哪了
Where did he go?

648
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,290
看到了吧
You see?

649
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,800
我像是个菜乌
I feel like a blundering novice.

650
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:53,870
我们对抗的不是疾病
Gentlemen, we're not fighting some disease here.

651
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:59,040
露西小姐的咬痕是妖魔所致
Those marks on your dear Miss Lucy's neck were made...by something unspeakable out there.

652
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,370
已死又未死
Dead, but not dead.

653
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:03,610
妖魔追猎我们,原因不明
It stalks us for some dread purpose I do not comprehend.

654
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,640
它吸露西的血维持生命
To live, it feeds on Lucy's precious blood.

655
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:09,310
是个野兽,怪物
It is a beast, a monster.

656
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:30,900
我和露西是怎么了
What is happening to Lucy and to me?

657
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:34,130
年幼时我从不烦躁
When I was younger, my feelings were never troubled.

658
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:36,570
真希望能恢复往日
I wish I were myself again...

659
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:39,580
那么敏锐,永可依赖的米娜
the sensible Mina I always depended on.

660
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,750
艾伯森酒
Absinthe...

661
01:03:49,330 --> 01:03:52,160
含春药的成份
is the aphrodisiac of the self.

662
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:55,760
住在酒里的...
The green fairy...

663
01:03:56,330 --> 01:04:00,070
绿仙子
who lives in the absinthe...

664
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:03,230
要你的灵魂
wants your soul.

665
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,170
但是
But...

666
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:10,680
你可以放心
you are safe with me.

667
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:28,290
王子...
Tell me, Prince...

668
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:31,090
告诉我你家乡的事
tell me of your home.

669
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:38,110
全世界最美丽的地方
The most beautiful place...in all creation.

670
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:42,810
一定是
Yes, it must be.

671
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:48,880
森林
A land beyond a great,

672
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:50,450
密布
vast forest...

673
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:56,120
山峦起伏
surrounded by majestic mountains...

674
01:04:57,790 --> 01:04:59,630
葡萄园
lush vineyards...

675
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:06,070
遍地无处可比拟的
and flowers of such frailty and beauty...

676
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,840
妖艳花朵
as to be found nowhere else.

677
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:22,680
你说的好像亲眼看过
You've described my home...as if you had seen it firsthand.

678
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:29,390
或许受你的声调影响
It's your voice, perhaps.

679
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,090
好熟悉
It's so familiar.

680
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,730
仿佛...
It's like...

681
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:40,600
梦中无法认出的声音
It's like a voice in a dream I cannot place...

682
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:45,260
在我孤独时
and it comforts me.

683
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:47,940
安抚我  在你孤独时
- When I am alone. - When you are alone.

684
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:12,560
王妃呢?
And what of the princess?

685
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:20,710
王妃?
Princess?

686
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:23,240
有王子就有王妃
There is always a princess...

687
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:27,640
穿着白衣裙
with gowns flowing white.

688
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:34,820
她的脸
And her face.

689
01:06:35,090 --> 01:06:36,390
天啊
Oh, God...

690
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,730
她的脸
her face...

691
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:45,200
是条河
is a river.

692
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,400
王妃
The princess...

693
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:57,810
是条....充满伤痛
she's a river filled with tears of sadness...

694
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:01,240
心碎泪水的河
and heartbreak.

695
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,660
是有过王妃
There was a princess.

696
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:11,660
伊丽莎白
Elisabeta.

697
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:18,930
她是全世界最耀眼的女子
She was the most radiant woman...in all the empires of the world.

698
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:30,050
谣言拆散了她与王子
Man's deceit took her from her ancient prince.

699
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:33,610
她投入...
She leapt to her death...

700
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:37,350
你提到的河而死
into the river that you spoke of.

701
01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:42,050
我的 母语...
In my mother's tongue...

702
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:48,420
那条河叫
it is called...argesh.

703
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,370
王妃河
River princess.

704
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:30,260
亲爱的女士
Dear Madam.

705
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:33,460
你的未婚夫在修道院(阿格莎修女8月12日之信)
Your fiance is safe and in the care...

706
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:35,940
安然无恙
of the good sisters of the Blessed Sacrament.

707
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:41,640
哈克先生认为你有生命危险
Mr. Harker believes your life is in extreme danger...

708
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:45,410
他急切希望你到此
and he desires with all urgency that you join him here...

709
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:48,420
立刻成婚
so that you may immediately be married.

710
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:50,880
祝福你
Yours with all blessings,

711
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,850
阿格莎修女上
Sister Agatha.

712
01:09:55,530 --> 01:09:57,320
亲爱的王子
My sweet prince.

713
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:00,430
绝不能让强纳生知道
Jonathan must never know of us.

714
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:09,770
露西
Lucy!

715
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,430
我是亚拉汉梵海辛
I'm Abraham Van Helsing.

716
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:13,010
梵海辛博士
Dr. Van Helsing.

717
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:16,080
你是米娜小姐,露西的好友?
And you're Madam Mina, dear friend to our Lucy, ja?

718
01:10:16,510 --> 01:10:17,600
她怎样了
How is she, doctor?

719
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:19,440
仍很虚弱
She's still very weak.

720
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:24,250
她告诉我你担心你爱的强纳生
She tells me of your beloved Jonathan Harker...and your worry for him.

721
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:27,280
我为所有的年轻爱侣担心
Well, I, too, worry for all young lovers.

722
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:33,450
生命中有黑暗
There are darknesses in life, my child...

723
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:35,960
也有光明
and there are lights.

724
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:38,790
你便是光明,亲爱的米娜
You are one of the lights, dear Mina...

725
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,230
光明中的光明
the light of all light.

726
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:48,070
去看你的朋友吧
Go now. See your friend.

727
01:11:04,830 --> 01:11:06,290
米娜
Mina.

728
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:11,660
你不太一样,米娜
You look different,Mina.

729
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:15,000
脸上发光
You look positively radiant.

730
01:11:15,610 --> 01:11:17,040
有强纳生的消息
You heard from Jonathan.

731
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:20,360
是吗?  嗯
- Didn't you? - Yes.

732
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:22,940
他平安无事,露西
He's safe,Lucy.

733
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:25,680
在罗马尼亚一家修道院
He's in a convent in Romania.

734
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:29,170
得了严重的脑热病
He's suffering from a violent brain fever.

735
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:32,750
修女替他写信
The good sisters are caring for him.They wrote to me,

736
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:35,080
说他需要我
and they say he needs me...

737
01:11:37,930 --> 01:11:39,090
但....我不去
but I won't go.

738
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:41,430
我不要丢下你
I'm not going to leave you.

739
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,560
米娜
Mina.

740
01:11:43,970 --> 01:11:46,370
你必须去
You've got to go to him...

741
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,190
你要爱他
and you've got to love him...

742
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:51,700
立刻嫁给他
and marry him right then and there.

743
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:55,870
这个你收下
And I want you to take this, my sister.

744
01:11:56,550 --> 01:11:58,410
我送你的贺礼
It's my wedding gift to you.

745
01:11:58,550 --> 01:12:00,020
不,露西
No,Lucy.

746
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:02,910
别担心任性的小露西
Don't worry about spoiled little Lucy.

747
01:12:05,290 --> 01:12:06,980
我会康复的
I'll be all right.

748
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,860
代我向强纳生致爱
Tell Jonathan oceans of love.

749
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:27,570
杰克 她怎么了?
Jack, how is she?

750
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:48,720
我受不了大蒜味
This is why I cannot breathe!

751
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,200
露西 这是药
Lucy, it's medicinal.

752
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:53,830
会助你睡得好
To help you sleep. To dream better dreams.

753
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:56,900
只是普通大蒜嘛
It's garlic! It's nothing but common garlic!

754
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,170
昆西来看你了
Quincey's here to see you.

755
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:00,670
拿点白兰地来
Get some brandy.

756
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,040
露西小姐
Now, Miss Lucy,

757
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:06,350
你好好休息,阿瑟叫我来看你
you just rest easy.Arthur sent me to take care of you.

758
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:09,510
他说你不快好,我就得
He said if you don't get better quick...

759
01:13:09,690 --> 01:13:12,090
一枪毙了你,像对跛脚马般
I have to put you out of your misery like a lame horse.

760
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:17,690
你真野蛮
You're such a beast.

761
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:22,760
吻我好吗?昆西?
Will you kiss me?Quincey?

762
01:13:25,970 --> 01:13:27,370
吻我
Kiss me.

763
01:13:30,610 --> 01:13:31,600
吻我
Kiss me.

764
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:37,410
老笨蛋
That old coot!

765
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:39,240
放开我
Get off me!

766
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:41,580
露西,听我说
Lucy,Listen to me!

767
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:43,910
睡觉  快睡觉
Sleep, sleep now. Sleep.

768
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:48,320
睡吧
You're at peace.

769
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:49,480
你们看
Look. There. There.

770
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:57,190
吸血鬼
Nosferatu.

771
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:05,140
(吸血鬼)

772
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,840
此篇讲述野蛮的
"Here occurs the shocking and frightening history...

773
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:17,840
德古拉王子骇人野史
of the wild, berserk Prince Dracula...

774
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:20,010
他将人插住
How he impaled people and roasted them...

775
01:14:20,190 --> 01:14:21,850
烤身、煮头
boiled their heads in a kettle...

776
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:24,360
活生生的剥皮
how he skinned them alive...

777
01:14:24,530 --> 01:14:27,860
凌迟,饮他们的血
and hacked them to pieces and then drank their blood."

778
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:34,100
德古拉
Dracul.

779
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,700
血便是生命
For blood is the life.

780
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:54,390
亲爱的王子
"My dearest Prince,

781
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:56,390
请原谅我
forgive me.

782
01:14:56,790 --> 01:15:00,060
我收到未婚夫自罗马尼亚的信
I have received word from my fiance in Romania.

783
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:03,730
我要去见他并完婚
I am en route to join him. We are to be married.

784
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,990
永不再见
I will never see you again.

785
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:08,930
米娜上
Mina."

786
01:15:18,850 --> 01:15:23,980
奇怪,那位怪友好像也跟来了
It is odd, but I feel almost...that my strange friend is with me.

787
01:15:24,090 --> 01:15:26,610
他在我的思绪中
He speaks to me in my thoughts.

788
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:30,090
与他在一起我最有活力
With him I felt more alive than ever I had.

789
01:15:30,530 --> 01:15:33,020
如今他不在,又将成婚
And now without him, soon to be a bride...

790
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:35,690
我深感困惑失落
I feel confused and lost.

791
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:39,530
也许我虽想做好,其实很坏
Perhaps, though I try to be good, I am bad.

792
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:43,200
或许我是个善变的坏女人
Perhaps I am a bad, inconstant woman.

793
01:16:02,330 --> 01:16:03,720
飓风！
Winds!

794
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:06,320
飓风！
Winds!

795
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:11,490
刮大风吧！
Winds!

796
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:16,060
就是这原因
It is the cause.

797
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:19,000
就是它
It is the cause of my soul!

798
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:21,170
天啊!德古拉
It is Dracula...

799
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:23,070
这个僵尸
the undead...

800
01:16:23,410 --> 01:16:26,280
我一生追击的敌人
the foe I have pursued all my life.

801
01:16:30,690 --> 01:16:32,620
德古拉!
Dracula!

802
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:37,850
杰克,快有好多事要告诉你
Jack, hurry! I have much to tell you.

803
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:42,090
小心守候
Guard her well, Mr. Morris.

804
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:44,360
今晚不得失误
Do not fail here tonight.

805
01:16:44,530 --> 01:16:49,860
我们对抗的是超越凡人的法力
We are dealing with forces beyond all human experience...an enormous power, so guard her well.

806
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:53,900
若不尽责你的露西将会成女妖
Otherwise your precious Lucy will become a bitch of the devil...

807
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:55,770
邪恶的魔女
a whore of darkness!

808
01:16:57,850 --> 01:16:59,370
老疯子
You're a sick old buzzard.

809
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:02,780
听清楚,小子
Hear me out, young man.

810
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:05,590
露西不是意外所致
Lucy is not a random victim attacked by mere accident.

811
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:07,250
明白了吗?   不
Do you understand? No.

812
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:11,320
她自愿受其蛊惑
She is a willing recruit, a breathless, wanton follower.

813
01:17:11,490 --> 01:17:13,890
忠实的门徒
I dare say, a devoted disciple.

814
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:16,550
她是魔鬼的姘妇
She is the devil's concubine!

815
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,660
懂了吗
Do you understand me?

816
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:24,700
但我们仍可救回她的魂
Yet, we may still save her precious soul.

817
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:29,470
但...得先填饱肚子,杰克
But not on an empty stomach.

818
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:30,730
杰克  是的,先生
- Jack! - Here, sir.

819
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:34,010
我饿死了,快跟我去吃
I starve. Feed me.

820
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:36,210
老傻子！
You old coot!

821
01:19:51,310 --> 01:19:54,640
无能的人类跟愚蠢的驱邪物
Your impotent men with their foolish spells...

822
01:19:54,810 --> 01:19:58,370
保护不了你
cannot protect you from my power.

823
01:20:11,190 --> 01:20:13,990
我诅咒你成为僵尸
I condemn you to living death...

824
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:17,430
永远
to eternal hunger...

825
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:22,270
嗜饮...鲜血
for living blood.

826
01:21:46,890 --> 01:21:47,880
杰克
Jack!

827
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:58,160
我知道你深爱她
I know how deeply you loved her.

828
01:21:58,370 --> 01:22:00,100
所以你得相信
That is why you must trust me and believe.

829
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:02,160
叫我如何相信?
Believe? How can I believe?

830
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:06,270
你在天黑前带解剖刀来
I want you to bring me, before nightfall, a set of postmortem knives.

831
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:08,200
解剖?露西
An autopsy? Lucy?

832
01:22:08,380 --> 01:22:12,040
不算,我要割她的头挖她的心
No, not exactly. I just want to cut off her head and take out her heart.

833
01:22:19,820 --> 01:22:22,450
9月17日,日记
Diary, 17th September.

834
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:24,320
可怜的强纳生
Poor Jonathan.

835
01:22:24,660 --> 01:22:26,460
他仍重病
He's still so ill.

836
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:29,560
但回到伦敦他很开心
He's cheered by the familiar streets in London.

837
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,990
而我,因露西已死反而难过
For me, now that Lucy is dead, it is a sad homecoming.

838
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:38,000
仿佛部份的我也已死去
It is as if a part of me is dead too...

839
01:22:38,140 --> 01:22:40,900
除了暗盼
except for the tiny hope that lives in me...

840
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:43,570
能再见到我的王子
that I will again see my prince.

841
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:45,240
他在伦敦吗?
Is he here?

842
01:22:46,350 --> 01:22:47,480
我已结婚,
Now that I am married...

843
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:51,590
才明白对萦绣山中的他
I begin to understand the nature of my feelings for my strange friend...

844
01:22:51,590 --> 01:22:53,920
是怎样的情绪
who is always in my thoughts.

845
01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:07,100
强纳生,怎么了?
Jonathan, what is it?

846
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:09,170
就是他
It is the man himself.

847
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:11,430
他变年轻了
Look, he's grown young.

848
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,610
各位
Gentlemen,

849
01:23:57,750 --> 01:23:59,820
非掘露西的墓不可吗?
must we desecrate poor Lucy's grave?

850
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:01,760
她死得够惨了
She died horribly enough.

851
01:24:04,460 --> 01:24:07,690
若她已死则无碍
If Miss Lucy is dead, then no wrong can be done to her.

852
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:09,450
若没死
But if she's not dead...

853
01:24:10,470 --> 01:24:12,700
你是说她被活埋?
What are you saying, man? That she's been buried alive?

854
01:24:13,230 --> 01:24:15,860
不,我只是说
No. All I say is

855
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:17,790
她没死
she is undead.

856
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:20,130
没死
Undead.

857
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:22,030
这真疯狂
This is insane.

858
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:43,620
各位 动手吧
Gentlemen, shall we?

859
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:46,230
一、二、三
One, two, three.

860
01:25:03,590 --> 01:25:04,920
她呢?
Where is she?

861
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:08,410
她呢?
Where is she?

862
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,090
你把她怎么了
What have you done with her?

863
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:17,430
她住在上帝恩典不及之处飘荡在黑暗界
She lives beyond the grace of God...a wanderer in the outer darkness.

864
01:25:17,430 --> 01:25:20,230
她是吸血鬼
She is vampyre, nosferatu.

865
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:26,100
这些怪物被吸血后不会死
These creatures do not die like the bee after the first sting...

866
01:25:26,270 --> 01:25:29,270
反受传染而成不朽
but instead grow strong and become immortal...once infected by another nosferatu.

867
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:36,340
所以,吾友
So my friends,

868
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:38,780
我们不是对抗一个怪物
we fight not one beast...

869
01:25:38,850 --> 01:25:43,850
而是长久流传以血为生的族群
but legions that go on age after age after age...feeding on the blood of the living.

870
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:51,460
快躲起来
Quickly, hide. Now.

871
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:21,960
露西
Lucy!

872
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:23,090
露西
Lucy!

873
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:31,000
来,阿瑟
Come to me, Arthur.

874
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:35,340
扔下其它人,来我这里
Leave these others and come to me.

875
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:40,280
我好想拥抱你
My arms are hungry for you, my darling.

876
01:26:41,420 --> 01:26:44,080
吻我,抱我
Kiss me and caress me...

877
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:46,580
我亲爱的丈夫,我求你
my darling husband, please.

878
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:49,350
我们有十字架和圣水
We wave Christ and His holy blood!

879
01:26:49,660 --> 01:26:52,180
我们在主内坚强
We are strong in the Lord and

880
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:55,520
主赋与我们力量
the power of His might!

881
01:26:56,760 --> 01:27:00,360
主赋与我们力量
The power of God is upon us!

882
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:03,200
主赋与我们力量
The power of God is upon us!

883
01:27:05,010 --> 01:27:07,130
主赋与我们力量
The power of God is upon us!

884
01:27:10,810 --> 01:27:13,370
我将你带至光明
I bring you from shadow into light!

885
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:18,110
黑暗王子,我将你逐至地狱
I cast you out, the prince of darkness...into hell!

886
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:23,760
只需片刻勇气,
A moment's courage, and it is done.

887
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:25,690
左手拿凿子
Take the stake in your left hand...

888
01:27:27,630 --> 01:27:29,560
对准心脏
place the point over the heart.

889
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,630
奉主之名,敲下去
Then in God's name, strike. Do it now!

890
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:54,080
吃呀,大餐
Eat, feast.

891
01:27:54,590 --> 01:27:57,250
将来你们需要力气
You'll need your strength for the dark days ahead.

892
01:27:57,930 --> 01:27:58,920
米娜
Mina?

893
01:28:00,430 --> 01:28:01,590
博士 嗯?
- Doctor? - Ja?

894
01:28:03,330 --> 01:28:04,820
露西怎么死的？
How did Lucy die?

895
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,290
这个...
Well...

896
01:28:11,110 --> 01:28:12,540
她死前痛苦吗？
Was she in great pain?

897
01:28:12,940 --> 01:28:15,270
是的,我们砍掉她的头
Ja, she was in great pain. Then we cut off her head...

898
01:28:15,610 --> 01:28:18,880
在心脏钉下十字架,她就安息了
and drove a stake through her heart and burned it and then she found peace.

899
01:28:19,010 --> 01:28:22,010
博士  拜托别说了
Doctor! Please.

900
01:28:25,950 --> 01:28:27,290
哈克先生
So, Mr. Harker...

901
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:31,020
身为你的医生,问你个
I must now ask you, as your doctor...

902
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:35,390
敏感问题
a sensitive question.

903
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:39,560
你和那些怪物在一起时
During your infidelity with those creatures...those demonic women...

904
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:41,950
可曾吃过
did you, for one instant,

905
01:28:41,970 --> 01:28:43,300
她们的血
taste of their blood?

906
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:45,500
没有
No!

907
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:50,510
没有?
No?

908
01:28:51,710 --> 01:28:52,700
没有
No!

909
01:28:55,150 --> 01:28:56,280
很好
Good!

910
01:28:56,780 --> 01:29:01,620
那你没染上露西那种病
Then you have not infected your blood with the terrible...disease that destroyed poor Lucy.

911
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,660
博士,你要知道
Doctor, you must understand.

912
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,560
以前我疑幻似真
I doubted everything...

913
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:18,570
甚至以为自己疯了
even my mind.

914
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:20,800
终日恐惧
I was impotent with fear.

915
01:29:21,310 --> 01:29:22,400
我知道  但是
- I know. - But, sir...

916
01:29:22,580 --> 01:29:27,470
我知道吸血鬼睡在哪
I know where the bastard sleeps.

917
01:29:27,650 --> 01:29:29,310
我把他带到
I brought him there,

918
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:31,410
卡费教堂
to Carfax Abbey.

919
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:36,750
吸血鬼的确存在
Vampires do exist.

920
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:40,820
我们围攻的这一个
And this one we fight, this one we face...

921
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:43,660
有二十人的力气
has the strength of 20 or more people...

922
01:29:43,830 --> 01:29:45,890
你可以证明
and you can testify for that, Mr. Harker.

923
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:51,240
他能控制低等的蝙蝠、鼠狼
But he can also control the meaner things of life...the bat, the rodent, the wolf.

924
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:55,440
可化为烟雾遁形
He can appear as mist, as vapor, as fog and vanish at will.

925
01:29:56,580 --> 01:29:58,510
德古拉法力很大,
Now, all these things Dracula can do...

926
01:29:58,510 --> 01:30:00,180
但他不自由
but he is not free.

927
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:03,580
他必须躺在故土中增加魔力
He must rest in the sacred earth of his homeland to gain his evil power.

928
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:06,690
我们必须在此将他毁灭
It is here that we must find him and destroy him utterly.

929
01:30:07,590 --> 01:30:10,850
我替这个伯爵难过
I almost feel pity for anything so hunted as this count.

930
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:12,980
你怎会怜悯这种怪物
How can you pity such a creature?

931
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:16,290
我带米娜去我的医院
I'll take Mina to my quarters.

932
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:18,430
你在那儿才安全
Good. You'll be safer there.

933
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,100
子弹伤不了他,
Mr. Morris, your bullets will not harm him.

934
01:30:25,270 --> 01:30:27,540
一定得砍头 我建议你用猎刀
He must be beheaded. I suggest you use your big bowie knife.

935
01:30:27,710 --> 01:30:30,700
我不打算贴近他,博士
Well, I wasn't plannin' on getting that close, Doc.

936
01:30:31,810 --> 01:30:33,210
主人！
Master!

937
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:36,380
主人
Master!

938
01:30:37,950 --> 01:30:39,350
主人...
Master!

939
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:51,730
杰克大夫
Dr. Jack!

940
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:55,660
我获准得永生
I've been promised eternal life!

941
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:58,830
杰克
Dr. Seward,

942
01:30:58,910 --> 01:31:00,460
那人是谁
who is that man?

943
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:03,040
那是伦费先生,你不适合久留
Mr. Renfield. This is no place for you, Madam Mina.

944
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:06,640
伦费?我得见他
Renfield? I must see him.

945
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:08,970
伦费先生
Mr. Renfield,

946
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:10,980
别乱来
behave yourself.

947
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:15,260
这位是哈克太太
This is Mrs. Harker.

948
01:31:16,990 --> 01:31:18,250
晚安
Good evening.

949
01:31:18,430 --> 01:31:20,330
晚安,伦费先生
Good evening, Mr. Renfield.

950
01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:23,520
我太调皮了
It seems I've been rather naughty.

951
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:27,530
我认识你
I know you.

952
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,940
你是主人的新娘
You're the bride my master covets.

953
01:31:32,540 --> 01:31:34,770
我有丈夫了
I have a husband.

954
01:31:35,210 --> 01:31:36,870
我是哈克太太
I am Mrs. Harker.

955
01:31:38,210 --> 01:31:40,740
我的主人提过你
My master tells me about you.

956
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:43,610
他怎么说?
What does he tell you?

957
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:46,450
说他要来
That he is coming.

958
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:50,010
他要来找你
That he is coming for you.

959
01:31:50,260 --> 01:31:53,190
过来点
Oh, please.

960
01:31:59,170 --> 01:32:01,190
别留在这
Don't stay here.

961
01:32:01,870 --> 01:32:04,360
离开这些人
Get away from these men,

962
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:05,970
求求你
please.

963
01:32:07,580 --> 01:32:11,310
我祈求主不要再见到你
And I pray to God I may never see your sweet face again.

964
01:32:15,150 --> 01:32:17,810
愿主祝福保佑你
And may the Lord bless and keep you.

965
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:30,750
主人！
Master!

966
01:32:31,170 --> 01:32:32,500
主人
Master!

967
01:32:32,930 --> 01:32:35,600
你答应我让我永生的
You promised me eternal life...

968
01:32:36,070 --> 01:32:38,770
你却给了这名美女
but you give it to the pretty woman!

969
01:32:39,270 --> 01:32:40,600
杰克大夫
Dr. Jack!

970
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:43,330
我不是疯子
I'm no lunatic man!

971
01:32:43,510 --> 01:32:46,410
我很正常,在为灵魂奋战
I'm a sane man fighting for his soul!

972
01:32:46,610 --> 01:32:49,950
我的房间很简陋,但很舒适
My quarters are spare, but I think you will find them comfortable.

973
01:32:50,950 --> 01:32:52,510
杰克大夫
Dr. Jack!

974
01:32:52,790 --> 01:32:55,350
有水和清洁用品
Water and toiletries at your disposal.

975
01:32:57,930 --> 01:33:00,090
你在这十分安全
You'll be completely safe here.

976
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:03,980
毁掉每个箱子
Destroy every box.

977
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:06,220
浇圣水
Sterilize the earth inside.

978
01:34:06,430 --> 01:34:07,920
让他无处可逃
Leave him no refuge.

979
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:10,490
开始驱魔
Let the exorcism begin.

980
01:34:37,290 --> 01:34:38,620
伦费
Renfield.

981
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:42,720
你背叛了我
You have betrayed me.

982
01:34:44,330 --> 01:34:45,560
没有
No.

983
01:34:47,130 --> 01:34:49,030
主人,我没有
No, master.

984
01:34:50,670 --> 01:34:52,260
我没有
No.

985
01:34:53,070 --> 01:34:54,910
我侍奉你
I serve you.

986
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:57,980
我只侍奉你
I serve only you.

987
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:58,240
吾爱
Oh, yes, my love.

988
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,430
你找到我了
You've found me.

989
01:36:04,780 --> 01:36:06,910
我最珍贵的生命
My most precious life.

990
01:36:07,350 --> 01:36:09,780
我要这事发生
I have wanted this to happen.

991
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:12,510
我都知道了
I know that now.

992
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:17,380
我要永远和你在一起
I want to be with you always.

993
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:20,860
你不明白自己在说什么
You cannot know what you are saying.

994
01:36:22,660 --> 01:36:24,720
是的
Yes...

995
01:36:24,870 --> 01:36:26,530
我知道
I do know.

996
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:43,150
我怕再也感受不到你的触摸
I feared I would never feel your touch again.

997
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:45,750
我以为你死了
I thought you were dead.

998
01:36:52,990 --> 01:36:57,220
这躯壳里没有生命
There is no life in this body.

999
01:37:01,070 --> 01:37:02,730
但你活着
But you live.

1000
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:06,230
你是活的
You live.

1001
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:10,170
你到底是什么?
What are you?

1002
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:15,010
我要知道 你一定得告诉我
I must know. You must tell me.

1003
01:37:22,190 --> 01:37:23,350
我...
I am...

1004
01:37:25,530 --> 01:37:26,860
什么都不是
nothing.

1005
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:29,520
没有生命
Lifeless.

1006
01:37:31,030 --> 01:37:32,360
没有灵魂
Soulless.

1007
01:37:32,530 --> 01:37:33,930
什么意思
What do you mean?

1008
01:37:34,170 --> 01:37:36,160
人皆恨我怕我
Hated and feared.

1009
01:37:37,470 --> 01:37:40,630
我在世上已死
I am dead to all the world.

1010
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:42,240
听好
Hear me.

1011
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:46,040
我是
I am the monster...

1012
01:37:46,250 --> 01:37:49,150
众人皆欲杀之的怪物
that breathing men would kill.

1013
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:52,620
我就是德古拉
I am Dracula.

1014
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:10,900
你杀死露西!
You murdered Lucy!

1015
01:38:12,740 --> 01:38:13,970
天啊
God!

1016
01:38:23,650 --> 01:38:25,480
我爱你
I love you.

1017
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:31,050
上帝 原谅我,我爱你
Oh, God, forgive me, I do.

1018
01:38:50,580 --> 01:38:52,980
我要变得和你一样
I want to be what you are...

1019
01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:56,650
见你所见,爱你所爱
see what you see...Iove what you love.

1020
01:38:58,120 --> 01:38:59,240
米娜
Mina.

1021
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:02,150
想和我一样
To walk with me...

1022
01:39:02,890 --> 01:39:06,120
你必须死亡
you must die to your breathing life...

1023
01:39:06,260 --> 01:39:08,270
在我的世界重生
and be reborn to mine.

1024
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:11,660
你永远是我的爱
You are my love...

1025
01:39:12,930 --> 01:39:15,400
与生命
and my life always.

1026
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:24,400
那么...
Then...

1027
01:39:25,180 --> 01:39:27,510
我将让你永生
I give you life eternal...

1028
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:31,510
给你长久不息的爱
everlasting love...

1029
01:39:33,190 --> 01:39:36,280
教你 呼风唤雨
the power of the storm...

1030
01:39:37,290 --> 01:39:39,620
降兽驯禽
and the beasts of the earth.

1031
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:42,420
跟我走
Walk with me...

1032
01:39:43,030 --> 01:39:47,090
永远为我爱妻
to be my loving wife forever.

1033
01:39:47,270 --> 01:39:48,630
我愿意
I will. Yes. Yes.

1034
01:40:20,870 --> 01:40:23,800
喝下去 同我迈入
Drink and join me...

1035
01:40:25,210 --> 01:40:27,200
永生
in eternal life.

1036
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:44,260
不,我不能害你
I cannot let this be.

1037
01:40:45,990 --> 01:40:48,620
我不在乎,占有我吧
Please, I don't care. Make me yours.

1038
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:53,220
米娜,你将让我永世
You will be cursed as I am to walk in the shadow of death...

1039
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:55,770
被诅咒
for all eternity.

1040
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:59,500
我太爱你
I love you too much...

1041
01:41:00,310 --> 01:41:01,600
而不能害你
to condemn you.

1042
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:06,970
带我远离死亡阴影
Then take me away from all this death.

1043
01:41:53,090 --> 01:41:54,420
米娜
Mina.

1044
01:42:04,570 --> 01:42:07,130
你以为十字架
You think you can destroy me...

1045
01:42:07,570 --> 01:42:09,740
可以杀死我?
with your idols?

1046
01:42:13,310 --> 01:42:15,510
拿圣水
Sacred blood of Christ!

1047
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:18,310
我服侍十字架
I, who served the cross.

1048
01:42:18,850 --> 01:42:21,180
在数百年前
I, who commanded nations...

1049
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:23,950
我曾领导万军
hundreds of years before you were born.

1050
01:42:24,290 --> 01:42:26,280
你的军队溃败
Your armies were defeated.

1051
01:42:27,030 --> 01:42:28,360
你折磨...
You tortured and

1052
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:30,620
刑罚千万人
impaled thousands of people.

1053
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:33,960
我被背弃
I was betrayed.

1054
01:42:34,230 --> 01:42:35,570
看...
Look

1055
01:42:35,700 --> 01:42:37,290
你的上帝
what your God...

1056
01:42:37,570 --> 01:42:39,970
如何对待我
has done to me.

1057
01:42:40,310 --> 01:42:44,040
你与上帝的战争已结束  伏法吧
No, your war with God is over. You must pay for your crimes.

1058
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:49,810
基督制伏你
Christ compels you!

1059
01:42:49,980 --> 01:42:51,920
现在她是...
She is now...

1060
01:42:53,550 --> 01:42:56,890
我的新娘了
my bride!

1061
01:43:01,730 --> 01:43:02,990
灯火
More light!

1062
01:43:05,130 --> 01:43:06,330
灯火
Light!

1063
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:08,660
不够
More light!

1064
01:43:15,740 --> 01:43:18,840
好脏
Unclean.

1065
01:43:20,180 --> 01:43:21,170
捉住那些老鼠
- Get them! - This way!

1066
01:43:21,350 --> 01:43:22,710
得烧掉
- Get them! - They must be found.

1067
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:23,870
好脏
Unclean.

1068
01:43:24,550 --> 01:43:26,490
我们学到很多
We have learned something much.

1069
01:43:26,750 --> 01:43:28,480
德古拉怕我们
Dracula fears us.

1070
01:43:28,660 --> 01:43:30,210
他怕时间
He fears time.

1071
01:43:30,420 --> 01:43:33,220
否则何必匆匆逃走
For, if not, why does he hurry so?

1072
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:35,750
他走了
He is gone.

1073
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:38,000
你怎么知道?
How do you know?

1074
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:41,430
他告诉我的
He speaks to me.

1075
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:45,500
他和你心灵相通
He has a strong mind connection to you.

1076
01:43:47,610 --> 01:43:50,540
他的心脏强壮,熬的住死亡
His heart was strong enough to survive the grave.

1077
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:53,810
你赞赏他
- You admire him. - Ja.

1078
01:43:55,820 --> 01:43:58,680
他生前是个伟人
He was, in life, a most remarkable man...

1079
01:43:59,690 --> 01:44:02,350
思虑恢宏
and his mind was great and powerful...

1080
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:05,460
但更重要的是
but greater is the necessity to stamp him out...

1081
01:44:05,630 --> 01:44:07,750
让他永不超生
and destroy him utterly.

1082
01:44:08,660 --> 01:44:10,600
博士  嗯?
- Doctor? - Ja?

1083
01:44:13,730 --> 01:44:16,500
我知道我愈来愈像他
I know that I am becoming like him.

1084
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:19,970
你的救赎是他的毁灭
Your salvation is his destruction.

1085
01:44:21,070 --> 01:44:23,910
所以我要催眠你
That is why I want to hypnotize you.

1086
01:44:24,850 --> 01:44:27,250
我要你及时
I want you to help me find him before it is too late.

1087
01:44:27,750 --> 01:44:31,840
助我找到他  请帮我找到他
Please, help me find him. Please.

1088
01:44:32,650 --> 01:44:34,420
看这烛光
Look into this light...

1089
01:44:35,090 --> 01:44:37,850
光明中的光明
the light of all light, into this flame.

1090
01:44:39,090 --> 01:44:40,920
你双眼沉重
Your eyes are heavy.

1091
01:44:42,530 --> 01:44:45,760
你想睡觉  睡吧
You want to sleep. Sleep now.

1092
01:44:48,470 --> 01:44:50,100
睡吧
Sleep.

1093
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:53,140
我要去找他,他在叫我
I must go to him.He calls.

1094
01:44:54,680 --> 01:44:56,010
你听到什么
What do you hear?

1095
01:44:58,510 --> 01:45:00,950
听到什么
What do you hear, child?

1096
01:45:02,050 --> 01:45:04,750
听到什么
What do you hear?

1097
01:45:05,950 --> 01:45:08,290
我的王子在呼唤我
Oh, my prince is calling me.

1098
01:45:08,790 --> 01:45:12,780
他飘洋过海
He is traveling across icy seas to his beloved home.

1099
01:45:13,590 --> 01:45:16,260
回家滋长力量
There he will grow strong again.

1100
01:45:16,860 --> 01:45:20,130
我要去找他分享他的力量
I am coming to him to partake of his strength.

1101
01:45:26,510 --> 01:45:31,070
我们当晚在波涛中航过英吉利海峡
We left London by train and crossed the English Channel in stormy seas...

1102
01:45:31,410 --> 01:45:34,400
风浪无疑是伯爵的杰作
no doubt from the passage of the count's ship.

1103
01:45:34,850 --> 01:45:36,750
他呼风唤雨
He commands the winds,

1104
01:45:36,950 --> 01:45:39,080
但我们仍占上风
but we still have the advantage.

1105
01:45:39,290 --> 01:45:42,850
搭火车三天内可抵达瓦纳
By train, we can reach the Romanian port at Varna in three days.

1106
01:45:43,290 --> 01:45:45,550
搭船至少要一周
By ship, it will take him at least a week.

1107
01:45:47,030 --> 01:45:50,020
从巴黎经阿尔卑斯至布达佩斯
From Paris, we traveled through the Alps to Budapest.

1108
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:54,860
伯爵一定得经直布罗陀 我们已派人看守
The count must sail around the Rock of Gibraltar...where we have posted a lookout...

1109
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:57,700
至黑海瓦纳港
and then on to the Black Sea port in Varna...

1110
01:45:57,870 --> 01:46:01,100
我们在瓦纳与他碰头将船烧毁
where we will meet his ship and burn it into the sea.

1111
01:46:07,350 --> 01:46:10,650
回家
Home. Home.

1112
01:46:20,390 --> 01:46:23,330
吸血鬼以血为她受洗
The vampire's baptized her with his own blood...

1113
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:25,160
她已成吸血鬼
and her blood is dying, my friend.

1114
01:46:25,830 --> 01:46:27,390
没办法了
It is no use.

1115
01:46:39,750 --> 01:46:42,840
我不让你只身入险地
I will not let you go into the unknown alone.

1116
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:47,450
可怜的强纳生
Oh, my poor, dear Jonathan.

1117
01:46:47,650 --> 01:46:50,090
我对不起你
Oh, what have I done to you?

1118
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:54,850
不,是我害了我们俩
No, I have done this to both of us.

1119
01:46:55,030 --> 01:46:57,430
我听到他了,他接近了
I can hear him. He's coming closer.

1120
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:59,830
他在呼唤我
He's calling me to him.

1121
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:02,870
米娜,米娜
Mina!Mina!

1122
01:47:04,170 --> 01:47:05,600
留下来
Stay with me.

1123
01:47:05,740 --> 01:47:06,670
求求你
Please.

1124
01:47:06,910 --> 01:47:08,400
我好冷
I am so cold.

1125
01:47:21,050 --> 01:47:22,210
上车
All aboard!

1126
01:47:22,460 --> 01:47:26,650
正午,荷伍接到公司的电报
Noon. Holmwood received a wire from his clerk at Lloyd's.

1127
01:47:26,790 --> 01:47:31,390
伯爵的船在夜雾中赶过我们
The count's ship sailed past us in the night fog...to the northern port of Galatz.

1128
01:47:31,570 --> 01:47:34,400
这个魔鬼在探索米娜的思想
The black devil is reading Mina's mind.

1129
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,990
怎么捉他
How can we catch him now?

1130
01:47:45,410 --> 01:47:46,400
瓦纳港
Varna. Galatz.

1131
01:47:46,680 --> 01:47:51,920
格拉兹 约两百里  骑马可在他...
It's about 200 miles.I think that with the horses, we can cut him off...

1132
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:54,080
抵达古堡前拦截他
reach him before he reaches the castle.

1133
01:47:54,250 --> 01:47:57,220
我会派梵海辛到波戈隘口
I will dispatch Van Helsing straight for the Borgo Pass.

1134
01:47:57,560 --> 01:47:59,020
若我们失败,
If we fail in our task...

1135
01:47:59,030 --> 01:48:00,960
你一定得杀掉他
you will have to finish him.

1136
01:48:05,900 --> 01:48:09,030
米娜和梵海辛在瓦纳搭马车
From Varna, Mina and Van Helsing took a carriage...

1137
01:48:09,170 --> 01:48:11,500
我们朝格拉兹前进
and we continued on the train towards Galatz...

1138
01:48:11,710 --> 01:48:15,270
希望能在他登陆前拦截到
where we still hoped to intercept the count before he reaches land.

1139
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:17,570
我为米娜害怕
I am fearful for Mina.

1140
01:48:17,780 --> 01:48:20,250
她是诱饵
She is now our decoy.

1141
01:48:33,190 --> 01:48:34,920
我认得这地方
I know this place.

1142
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:37,930
世界的尽头  我们得继续走
- The end of the world. - We must go on.

1143
01:48:38,130 --> 01:48:40,360
天晚了,休息吧
It is late, child. We must rest here now.

1144
01:48:40,770 --> 01:48:41,700
我们得走
No, we must go!

1145
01:48:41,770 --> 01:48:42,530
米娜
Mina!

1146
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:44,260
他需要我,非得走
He needs me. We must go!

1147
01:48:48,940 --> 01:48:50,930
我们已经过毕斯屈栅
We have passed Bistritza.

1148
01:48:51,140 --> 01:48:53,480
德古拉又赢过我们
Dracula has outsmarted us again.

1149
01:48:53,610 --> 01:48:57,280
我们得知箱子在格拉兹被运走
We learned that his gypsies took charge of the vampire's box at Galatz...

1150
01:48:57,550 --> 01:49:00,110
已在波戈隘口的路上
and are now on the Borgo Pass road.

1151
01:49:17,070 --> 01:49:18,830
你一定得吃
Here. You must eat.

1152
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:20,530
我不饿
I am not hungry.

1153
01:49:24,210 --> 01:49:25,340
米娜
Mina!

1154
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:15,860
你对我很好,教授
You have been so good to me, Professor.

1155
01:50:25,310 --> 01:50:28,370
我知道露西暗恋你
I know that Lucy harbored secret desires for you.

1156
01:50:29,310 --> 01:50:30,780
她告诉我的
She told me.

1157
01:50:31,780 --> 01:50:34,440
我也知道男人要什么
I, too, know what men desire.

1158
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:53,820
你会砍我头
Will you cut off my head...

1159
01:50:53,900 --> 01:50:59,070
用十字架穿我的心吗?你这凶手
and drive a stake through my heart...as you did poor Lucy, you murdering bastard?

1160
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:04,600
绝不会
Not while I live.

1161
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:06,510
我发誓要保护你
I am sworn to protect you.

1162
01:51:21,460 --> 01:51:22,450
不
No!

1163
01:51:23,900 --> 01:51:25,800
你在圈内很安全
You are safe within the circle.

1164
01:51:25,970 --> 01:51:27,370
我已输掉露西
I've lost Lucy.

1165
01:51:27,630 --> 01:51:29,300
不能再将你输给他
I'll not lose you to him.

1166
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:30,830
撒旦的臭婊子
You're whores of Satan!

1167
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:37,180
这里是圣地
This is holy ground.

1168
01:51:37,340 --> 01:51:39,070
立刻走开
Leave this place now!

1169
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:42,410
走！
Leave!

1170
01:51:43,950 --> 01:51:46,720
奉主之名 离开这块圣地
In the name of God, leave this ground!

1171
01:51:46,980 --> 01:51:49,210
我以基督的名义命令你们!
I command you in the name of Christ!

1172
01:51:53,890 --> 01:51:54,880
不...
No...

1173
01:51:56,830 --> 01:51:58,020
不...
No...

1174
01:52:00,770 --> 01:52:02,760
主啊!该死
Christ! Damn you!

1175
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:42,530
德古拉
Dracul!

1176
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:46,740
德古拉！
Dracul!

1177
01:53:19,310 --> 01:53:20,710
米娜
Mina!

1178
01:53:21,610 --> 01:53:26,050
你就在附近了
You are...near.

1179
01:53:26,050 --> 01:53:27,210
吾爱
My love.

1180
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:41,570
他们要在日落前赶到
They're racing against the sunset.

1181
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:43,560
也许已经来不及
It may be too late. God help us.

1182
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:16,890
米娜
Mina!

1183
01:54:25,380 --> 01:54:26,470
开枪
Harker, shoot!

1184
01:54:35,260 --> 01:54:36,520
攻呀
Charge!

1185
01:55:20,170 --> 01:55:21,220
昆西
Quincey!

1186
01:56:34,170 --> 01:56:34,900
不
No!

1187
01:56:41,310 --> 01:56:42,300
米娜
Mina!

1188
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:01,260
昆西
Quincey!

1189
01:57:05,810 --> 01:57:06,600
不
No!

1190
01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:12,140
不要
No!

1191
01:57:18,580 --> 01:57:21,250
当你要杀我时你下的了手吗?
When my time comes, will you do the same to me?

1192
01:57:24,490 --> 01:57:25,480
你会吗?
Will you?

1193
01:57:31,630 --> 01:57:33,670
不,放他们走
- Wait. - Let them go.

1194
01:57:33,670 --> 01:57:37,600
我们的工作到此为止
Let them go. Our work is finished here.

1195
01:57:38,100 --> 01:57:39,730
她的工作才刚开始
Hers has just begun.

1196
01:57:50,780 --> 01:57:51,580
昆西
Quincey.

1197
01:58:03,930 --> 01:58:06,420
我们都成了上帝的疯子
We've all become God's madmen.

1198
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:10,630
我们都是
All of us.

1199
01:58:20,380 --> 01:58:22,370
我的上帝呢
Where is my God?

1200
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:27,150
他抛弃了我们
He has forsaken me.

1201
01:58:33,830 --> 01:58:35,820
结束了
It is finished.

1202
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:37,550
不
No.

1203
01:58:39,070 --> 01:58:40,400
吾爱
My love.

1204
01:58:45,510 --> 01:58:46,670
吾爱
My love.

1205
01:58:55,080 --> 01:58:56,740
在上帝面前
There, in the presence of God...

1206
01:58:57,620 --> 01:58:58,950
我终于了解
I understood at last how my love could release us all...

1207
01:58:59,120 --> 01:59:02,950
我的爱让我们脱离黑暗魔咒
from the powers of darkness.

1208
01:59:09,130 --> 01:59:11,790
我们的爱比死更强大
Our love is stronger than death.

1209
01:59:19,810 --> 01:59:22,570
让我安息
Give me peace.
