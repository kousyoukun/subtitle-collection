1
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:33,986
God be praised.
I am victorious.

2
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,619
She has taken her own life.

3
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,580
Her soul cannot be saved.

4
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:09,832
She is damned.

5
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,793
It is God's law.

6
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:25,389
Is this my reward
for defending God's church?

7
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:26,557
Sacrilege!

8
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:30,353
I renounce God!

9
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:34,857
I shall rise from my own death...

10
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:39,612
...to avenge hers
with all the powers of darkness.

11
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,424
The blood is the life...

12
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,388
...and it shall be mine!

13
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,652
For the dead travel fast.

14
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:29,150
How dare you touch him!
He belongs to me!

15
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:31,652
You yourself never loved.

16
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:39,493
Yes. I too can love.

17
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:45,708
And I shall love again.

18
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,927
Are we to have nothing tonight?
