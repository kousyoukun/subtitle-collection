他挚爱的新娘伊丽莎白
his bride Elisabeta whom he prized above all things on Earth...

9
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,980
知道他将与强敌对阵
knew that he must face an insurmountable force...

10
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,650
可能一去不返
from which he might never return.

11
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,440
(赞美主)

12
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,450
(我已获胜)

(要受天谴)

24
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,280
(这是神的律令)

25
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,950
(这就是我捍卫教会的报偿吗?)

26
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,020
(放肆)

27
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,830
(我唾弃上帝)

28
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,360
(我将死后复生)

29
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,110
(用尽邪恶力量为她复仇)

30
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,930
(血是生命泉源)

31

我都照你的吩咐做了,主人

当你论功行赏时

你的慷慨会使我受益无穷

心智丧失
He's lost his greedy mind, poor chap.

46
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:45,090
替个外国人德古拉伯爵理财
I want you to take over for his foreign client this rather eccentric Count Dracula.

47
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,430
他要在伦敦近郊买房产
- He's buying up property around London. - Of course, sir.

48
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,370
我会转告伯爵,谢谢你的委派

这是你的大好良机,哈克

但你必须立刻前往川索凡尼亚

终生难遇的机会
Opportunities such as this come but once in a lifetime.

52
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,680
那当然

53
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,510
伦费先生在川索凡尼亚怎么了
If I may inquire...what, in fact, happened to Mr. Renfield in Transylvania?

54
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,520
没什么
Nothing. Nothing.

55
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,750
私人问题

56

58

我们等了那么久
We've waited this long, haven't we?

59
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,100
我一回来就结婚
We can be married when I return.

60
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,500

我会写信的

今晨离开布达佩斯
Left Budapest early this morning.

67
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,320
依我看...
The impression I had was that we were leaving the west...

68
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,530
我们是往东欧前进(强纳生哈克之日记)
and entering the east.

69
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,010
这一带是罗马尼亚最东部
The district I am to enter is in the extreme east of the country...

70
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,710
摩达维亚、布卡维纳及川索凡尼亚
just on the borders of three states...Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina...

71
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,910
喀尔巴阡山交界处
in the midst of the Carpathian Mountains...

72
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,410
欧洲最荒凉无名的一区
one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe.

73
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,180
朋友

欢迎到喀尔巴阡山

76
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,430
我的马车
At the Borgo Pass...

77
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,930
将在波戈隘口等你
my carriage will await you and bring you to me.

78
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:05,710
深信你一路顺畅
I trust yourjourney from London has been a happy one...

79
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,200
并希望你在我国
and that you will enjoy your stay...

80
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,870

亲爱的强纳生离去近一周(米娜墨瑞之日记)
My Jonathan has been gone almost a week.

85
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,260
我虽因不能立刻成婚感到失望

86
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,730
仍为他出使重要任务而高兴
I am happy that he got sent on this important assignment.

87
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,400
我渴望他的音讯

88
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,680
到外国一定很有趣

89
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:51,210
不知我们能否一同出国游览
I wonder if we... I mean Jonathan and l...shall ever see them together.

90
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,970
我们来早了,还没人来
We're early, driver. No one is here.

91
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,170
(死人才走的快)

92
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,410
城堡远不远?
I say, is the castle far?

93
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,900
欢迎光临寒舍
Welcome to my home.

94
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,500
轻松自在地进来
Enter freely of your own will...

95
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:58,330
将你的欢乐留下
and leave some of the happiness you bring.

96
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,340
德古拉伯爵
Count Dracula?

97
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,440
在下就是
I am...

98
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,500
德古拉

99
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,240
寒舍蓬壁生辉了,哈克先生
And I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house.

100

请进
Come in.

101
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,040
请恕我
You will, I trust, excuse me that I...

102
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,870
不能奉陪
do not join you.

103
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,450
我已经吃过了
But I have already dined.

104
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,780
而且我从不喝
And I never drink...

105
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,780
葡萄酒
wine.

106
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:57,060
你的祖先? 五官很像

107
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:02,040
德古拉的徽记
The Order of the Dracul.

108
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,400
是条龙
The Dragon.

109
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,640
古代有个社
An ancient society...

110
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,910
我的祖先宣誓入会
pledging my forefathers...

111
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,150
保护教会抵御外侮
to defend their church against all enemies of Christ.

112
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,090
结果却和教会
That relationship was not entirely...

113
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:26,680
闹僵
successful.

114
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,630
是吗?
Oh, yes.

115
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,370
这不是开玩笑的事
It is no laughing matter.

116
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,470
我们德古家值得骄傲
We Draculs have a right to be proud.

117
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,310
不论阿提拉大帝如何残暴
What devil or witch was ever so great as Attila...

118
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,310
我也流着相同的血液
whose blood flows in these veins?

119
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,880
血！
Blood...

120
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:05,060
这年头成宝了
is too precious a thing in these times.

121
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,000
杀伐的年代已过去
The warlike days are over.

122
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,740
我家族的光荣战迹
The victories of my great race...

123
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,840
只成为故事
are but a tale to be told.

124
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,590
我是最后一名子嗣
I am the last of my kind.

125
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,430
恕我无知,伯爵
I have offended you with my ignorance, Count.

126
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,030
原谅我
Forgive me.

127
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:55,580
我渴望在伦敦拥挤的街道行走
I do so long to go through the crowded streets...of your mighty London...

128
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,620
混在匆忙的人群中
to be in the midst of the whirl and the rush of humanity...

129
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,950
分享它的生命力
to share its life...

130
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,460
它的改变
its changes,

131
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,060
及死亡
its death.

132
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,060
完成了 伯爵
There. You, Count, are...

133
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,630
你是卡费教堂的所有人
are the owner of Carfax Abbey at Purfleet.

134
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,130
恭喜
Congratulations.

135
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,540
贵公司对你赞许有加
Your firm writes most highly...of your talents.

136

他们说你的品味
They say you are a man of good...

137
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,910
很高

00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,570
还说你能力不输给
And that you are a worthy substitute...

139
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,910
前任...
to your predecessor,

140
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,480
伦费先生
Mr. Renfield.

141
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,490
你可以相信我
You may rely on me, Count.

142
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,990
恕我好奇
Forgive my curiosity, but why ten houses...

143
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,560
为何十所房子都买在伦敦附近
in such precise locations around London?

144
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,130
炒地皮?
Is it to raise the market value?

145
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,700
你相信宿命吗
Do you believe in destiny?

146
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,540
时间都可因...
That even the powers of time...

147
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,570
某一...
can be altered for

148
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,150
目的而改变?
a single purpose?

149
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:19,070
找到真爱的人才是...
The luckiest man who walks on this Earth...is the one who finds...

150
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,730
最幸运的人
true love.

151
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,490
你找到米娜了
You found Mina.

152
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,330
我以为丢了呢
I thought she was lost.

153
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,340
我回去后就结婚
We're to be married as soon as I return.

154
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,010
你结婚了吗 伯爵?
Are you married, Count?

155
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,670
先生
Sir...

156
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,280
你结婚了吗?
are you married?

157
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,180
结过一次
I was married once.

158
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,420
多年以前
Ages ago, it seems.

159
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,090
她死了
She died.

160
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,250
真令人难过
I'm very sorry.

161
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,530
是她命好
She was fortunate.

162
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:58,530
我一生凄凉
My life, at its best, is misery.

163
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,370
她一定会是个贤妻
She will no doubt make a devoted wife.

164
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:10,610
而你是个忠实的丈夫
And you a faithful husband.

165
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,980
来
Come.

166
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,490
写信给你公司
Write now, my friend, to your firm...

167
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:23,060
与心爱的人,说你要...
and to any loved ones, and say that it shall please you...

168
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:27,560
陪我住一个月
to stay with me...until a month from now.

169
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,500
一个月?
A month?

170
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,930
你要我待那么久?
Do you wish me to stay so long?

171
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,180
不可以拒绝
I will take no refusal.

172
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,790
1897年5月3O日,日记
Diary, 30th of May, 1897.

173
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,320
强纳生不愿我在他出差时与露西同住
I know that Jonathan does not want me to stay here with Lucy while he is away.

174
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:04,630
他怕我习惯威斯丁家的富贵后
He thinks that if I become accustomed to the wealth of the Westenra family...

175
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:08,810
便不肯当法律事务所职员的妻子
I will not be content as the wife of a mere clerk in a law firm.

176
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,880
但我和露西自幼是好友
But Lucy and I have been friends since we were children...

177
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:15,380
她不在乎我只是个教师
and she has never minded that I am only a schoolmistress.

178
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,330
好恶心
How disgustingly awful.

179
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,520
米娜
Mina!

180
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,960
(一千零一夜)

181
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,660
米娜
Mina!

182
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,660
米娜,你老在工作
Oh, Mina, you're always working.

183
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:45,740
你那有野心的强纳生逼你学打字?
Is your ambitious Jon Harker...forcing you to learn that ridiculous machine?

184
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,180
他也能逼你
When he could be forcing you to perform...

185
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:53,580
低级热情演出
unspeakable acts of desperate passion on the parlor floor.

186
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:57,520
露西,你不该这样说我未婚夫
Lucy, really.You shouldn't talk about my fiance in such a way.

187
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,620
婚姻不只是肉体享乐
There's more to marriage than carnal pleasure.

188
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,690
喔 米娜  是哦！
Oh, Mina. So I see.

189
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,860
要多的多
Much, much more.

190
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,690
那是
That's...

191
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,870
这是什么?露西
What is it, Lucy?

192
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,710
我看不懂
Because I don't understand it.

193
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,640
男女真的...
Can a man and woman really do...

194
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,650
这么做吗?
that?

195
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,250
我昨晚就做过
I did, only last night.

196
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,620
骗人!你没有
Fibber. You did not.

197
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,350
我有
Yes, I did.

198
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,480
在我的梦里
Well, in my dreams.

199
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,990
强纳生有这么棒吧?
Jonathan measures up, doesn't he?

200
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,500
你可以告诉我的
You can tell Lucy.

201
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,940
我们只接过吻
We've kissed. That's all.

202
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:46,160
他觉得娶不起我
He thinks he's too poor to marry me.

203
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,680
更糟的是我到你的华宅看你
And it's all the worse now that I'm here visiting you at Hillingham...

204
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,400
我的富有朋友
my rich friend.

205
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,910
却没人向我求过婚
Yes, but not even one marriage proposal.

206
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,580
我快满20了
And here I am, almost 20...

207
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,690
是个老处女了
practically a hag.

208
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,520
昆西摩里斯先生到
Mr. Quincey P. Morris.

209
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,600
你看
Oh, look.

210
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,860
那是什么人
What is that?

211
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,430
德州人
A Texan.

212
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,430
昆西摩里斯
Quincey P. Morris.

213
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,440
他好年轻稚气
He's so young and fresh...

214
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,870
像我胯间的野种马
like a wild stallion between my legs.

215
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,880
你真下流
You're positively indecent.

216
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:29,040
我只是知道男人想要什么
I just know what men desire.

217
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,950
看着
Watch.

00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,540
露西小姐
Miss Lucy.

220
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,220
你像春雨般清新
Why, you're as fresh as the spring rain.

221
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,880
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

222
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,780
昆西
Quincey.

223
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,530
求求你让我摸摸
Please let me touch it.

224
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,620
好...
It's so...

225
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,730

227
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,240
我亲爱的小女孩
Oh, my dear, sweet little girl.

228
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,580
我握着你的手,你也吻过我
I hold your hand...- and you've kissed me.

229
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,740

爱你深似海

我的达令,小宝贝
Poor little baby.

232
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,990
小猫咪过来

233
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,320
来,吻一个就会好了
Come over here and I'll kiss it better.

234

235

我可怜的小郎中,小医生

239
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:26,700
阿瑟

240
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,430
亲爱的

241
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,780

抱歉弄坏你的帽子

好美 这是我的妖女装

244
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,520

245
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,610
露西纯洁有德
Lucy is a pure and virtuous girl...

246
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:45,350
但她言语大胆真叫我震惊
but I admit that her free way of speaking shocks me sometimes.

247
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:51,460
强纳生说贵族都是口无遮拦
Jonathan says it is a defect of the aristocracy...that they say what they please.

248
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,370
但我崇拜露西
The truth is that I admire Lucy,

249
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:56,300
难怪男人爱她
and I'm not surprised that men flock around her.

250
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,640
我希望我像她一样漂亮迷人
I wish I were as pretty and as adored as she.

251
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,160
他是怎样的人?
What manner of man is this?

252

亚伦费,霍汤公司得力干部

Would you care for an hors d'oeuvre, Dr. Seward...

260
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,530
还是点心?
or a canape?

261
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,370
不了,谢谢,伦费先生
No, thank you, Mr. Renfield.

262
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,030
今晚感觉如何?
How are you feeling tonight?

263
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,770
比你好,单相思医生
Far better than you, my lovesick doctor.

264
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,770
你对我的私生活有兴趣
Is my personal life of interest to you?

265
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,440
对,我对所有人都有兴趣
Of course it is. All life interests me.

266
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,380
你的食物,伦费先生
Your diet, Mr. Renfield, is disgusting.

267
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,880
真恶心
Actually,

268
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,880
实际上很营养
they're perfectly nutritious.

269
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,390
我所摄取的生命
You see, each life that I ingest...

270
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,790
会带给我生命
gives back life to me.

271
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,620
苍蝇带给你生命?
A fly gives you life?

272
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,630
没错
Certainly.

273
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,500
叫我吃一般食物
But you might as well ask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chopsticks...

274
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,310
比用筷子夹分子还难
than to interest me in a lesser carnivore.

275
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,970
我要为你发明疯子新分类法

00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,990
吃！
Oh, yes.

280
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,090
你刚说麻雀吗?
Did you say sparrows?

281
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,250
体型大点的
Something larger, perhaps?

282
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,330
对
Oh, yes.

283

284
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,270
求求你
I beg you.

285
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,270
一只...
A little, sleek... a playful kitten.

286
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,010

Something I can teach. Something I can feed.

287
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:21,170
可喂食的小猫 小猫而已嘛
No one would refuse me a kitten.

288
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,610
成猫好吗
Wouldn't you prefer a cat?

289
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,280
好
Oh, yes.

291
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,960

509
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:06,040
听得到仆人在房屋另一端私语

524
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:55,590
老实说我很惶惑
Well, frankly, Arthur, I'm confounded.

525
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:58,520
你还在替露西小姐担心
Jack, are you still broodin' over Miss Lucy?

526
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:02,020
我看她神智错乱
I can only conclude it must be something mental.

527
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:05,530
胡说  你听到没
How very droll. Did you hear that, Quince?

530

我也不明白
I'm at a loss, I admit.

531
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:30,820
我已拍电报给埃布尔汉梵海辛精神哲学家
I've taken the liberty of cabling Abraham Van Helsing...the metaphysician/philosopher.

532
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:33,730
我看他是个巫医
Sounds like a goddamn witch doctor to me, Jack.

533
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:37,560
他是疑难杂症权威

535
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:44,410

540
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,120
这哪叫科学
How can you call this science?

541
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:38,860
居里夫人会同意这看法吗?
Do you think Madam Curie would invite such comparisons?Really.

542
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:44,630
我不该来的
I shouldn't have come here.

543
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,630

我跨越...时间的瀚海来寻你
I have crossed oceans of time...

550
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,630
各位来宾不要惊慌
There is no need to panic.

551
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:19,120
捕兽师自会处理

552

555
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:33,590
(好友濒死,不明原因之血疾)

556

热带吸血蝙蝠一天
The tropical pampas vampire bat must...

558

要吸体重十倍的鲜血
consume ten times its own weight in fresh blood each day...

559
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:54,780
否则它自己会死
or its own blood cells will die.

560
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:05,820
小混球
Cute little vermin, ja?

561
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,760
我们研究血液及血液疾病
Blood and the diseases of the blood...

562
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,500
如梅毒
such as syphilis, they concern us here.

563
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,870
性病“爱神之疾”
The very name "venereal diseases"...the diseases of Venus,

564
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:19,700
非常传神
imputes to them divine origin.

565
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:23,440
牵涉到基督文明
And they are involved in that sex problem about which...

566
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:27,780
对伦理与性的观念
the ethics and ideals of Christian civilization are concerned.

567
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:32,650
其实 文明与梅毒几乎同步发展
In fact, civilization and syphilization have advanced together.

568
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:36,850
这是什么
What is this?

569
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:38,790
电报,教授
It's from the telegraph, Professor.

570
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:40,190

573
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:03,140
这也许是我最后一篇日记

德古拉把我丢给这些妖女
Dracula has left me with these women...

575
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,020
她们喝我的血
these devils of the pit.

576
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,590
让我气息犹存
They drain my blood to keep me weak...

577
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,090
却逃不了
barely alive so I cannot escape.

578
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:16,600
我今天尝试最后一次逃到水边
I will try one last time today to escape to the water.

579
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:19,600
一定有路可以通到河边
There must be passageway to the river...

580
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,170
逃出这受诅之地
and then away from this cursed land...

581
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:25,340
及披着人皮的群魔
where the devil and his children still walk with earthly feet.

582
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:38,050
我正式宣布
For the record, I do attest...

583
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:41,390
此刻亚拉汉梵海辛
that at this point, I, Abraham Van Helsing...

584
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:45,260
亲自调查这些怪事
became personally involved in these strange events.

585
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:42,680
梵海辛教授,你果然来了
Professor Van Helsing, how good of you to come.

586
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:50,030
我一向乐于帮助需要我的朋友
I always come to my friends in need when they call me.

587
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:53,020
把病情详细告诉我
So, Jack, tell me everything about your case.

588
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,190
她有一般贫血症状
She has all the usual physical anemic signs.

589
00:58:56,330 --> 00:58:58,320
血液分析正常
Her blood analyzes normal, and yet it is not.

590
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:01,770
但事实上她持续失血
She manifests continued blood loss.

591
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:03,170
我找不出原因
I cannot trace the cause.

592
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:04,670
失血?怎么会
Blood loss? How?

593
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:15,820
把门关上
My God, close the doors!

594
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:28,490
天啊
My God...

595
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:30,500
她还是个孩子
she's only a child.

596
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:33,800
是啊
Ja.

597
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:36,570
老天！
My God.

598
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:41,910
不得延误立刻输血,脱掉外套
There's no time to lose. There must be a transfusion at once.Take off your coat.

599
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:45,110
还会绑止血带吧
Remember how to tie a tourniquet?Or have you forgotten?

600
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:46,580
你精通输血?
You perfected a procedure?

601
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:51,190
精通?不,我只会蓝斯坦法
Perfected? No. I've only experimented.Landsteiner's method.

602
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:55,180
只替动物输过,山羊、绵羊啦
Animals, goats, sheeps.

603
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:00,660
若血清有溶血现象红血球会破裂
If hemolysis occurs in the blood donor serum...her red blood cells will explode.

604
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,090
她就会死,把管子拿好
She will die. Take this tube.

605
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,170
你们在搞什么
What in God's name is going on up here?

606
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:10,930
这位是梵海辛教授
This is Professor Van Helsing, Art.

607
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:12,410
他把露西怎么了
What the hell is he doing to Lucy?

608
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:13,770
救她的命
He's trying to save her life.

609
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:14,640
老天！
Good God!

610
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:15,910
你是她的未婚夫
You're the fiance?

611
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:17,140
请让开
Please.

612
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,110
请！
Please.

613
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:24,780
外套脱掉,她生命垂危须输血
Take off your coat. This young lady's very ill. She's dying.She wants blood and blood she must have.

614
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,690
外套脱掉！
Take off your coat.

615
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:28,450
袖子卷起来
Roll up your sleeve, Art.

616
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:32,220
老天！快！
- Oh, God. - Quickly, quickly.

617
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:33,790
卷起来
Roll it up!

618
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:35,960
可能有点痛
This may hurt a little, Art.

619
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:52,050
请原谅我  她是我的命,最后一滴血都行
Forgive me. My life is hers. I would give my last drop of blood to save her.

620
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:53,310
最后一滴?
Your last drop?

621
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:56,310
谢谢,欢迎你
Thank you.You are very welcome here.

622
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:58,460
我不要那么多
I don't ask as much as that.

623
01:00:58,560 --> 01:00:59,650
目前还不要
Not yet.

624
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,190
握住她的手
Hold her hand.

625
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:18,040
杰克...她输了两人份的血
Jack, that poor creature has had the blood of two men put into her already.

626
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:21,800
妈呀!她装不了那么多血
Man alive. Her whole body couldn't hold that much blood.

627
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:26,180
露西的血去哪呢
What took it out?

628
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:28,280
问的好,摩里斯先生
That's a good question, Mr. Morris.

629
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,490
喉咙那些痕迹?
Those marks on her throat...

630
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:40,160
不是疾病或伤痕,而是失血处
no disease, no trituration...I am sure the blood loss occurred there.

631
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,620
血去哪呢?
Oh? Where did the blood go?

632
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:46,070
你以前是个细心的学生
You were once a careful student, Jack.

633
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:48,240
用脑呀,血去哪了?告诉我!
Use your brain! Where did the blood go?Tell me!

634
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:52,970
床铺上有血   没错
- The bed would be covered in blood. - Exactly.

635
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:57,970
你没观察到不可知的现象
You do not let your eyes see nor your ears hear...that which you cannot account for.

636
01:01:58,150 --> 01:02:02,140
有异物吸她的血后飞走?
Something just went up there, sucked it out of her and flew away?

637
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:05,410
对 有何不可?
Ja. Why not?

638
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:09,860
高明,真高明
That's brilliant. That's absolutely brilliant.

639
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:14,190
请问神医,露西是怎么了?
Will one of you learned doctors... or whatever you are...kindly tell me what is going on with my Lucy?

640
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:18,100
杰克,你是个科学家
Jack, you are a scientist.

641
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:22,940
宇宙中可有你不明了的事实?
Do you not think there are things in this universe you cannot understand...and which are true...

642
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:24,470
像是催眠
mesmerism, hypnotism?

643
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:26,340
你和夏卡已证实了
You and Charcot have proved hypnotism.

644
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:29,270
实体与灵体
Materialization, astral bodies.

645
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,290
教授?
Professor?

646
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:42,690
他去哪了
Where did he go?

647
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:46,790
看到了吧
You see?

648
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:50,300
我像是个菜乌
I feel like a blundering novice.

649
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:53,370
我们对抗的不是疾病
Gentlemen, we're not fighting some disease here.

650
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:58,540
露西小姐的咬痕是妖魔所致
Those marks on your dear Miss Lucy's neck were made...by something unspeakable out there.

651
01:02:58,540 --> 01:02:59,870
已死又未死
Dead, but not dead.

652
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:03,110
妖魔追猎我们,原因不明
It stalks us for some dread purpose I do not comprehend.

653
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:06,140
它吸露西的血维持生命
To live, it feeds on Lucy's precious blood.

654
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,810
是个野兽,怪物
It is a beast, a monster.

655
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:30,400
我和露西是怎么了
What is happening to Lucy and to me?

656
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,630
年幼时我从不烦躁
When I was younger, my feelings were never troubled.

657
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:36,070
真希望能恢复往日
I wish I were myself again...

658
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:39,080
那么敏锐,永可依赖的米娜
the sensible Mina I always depended on.

659
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:48,250
艾伯森酒
Absinthe...

660
01:03:48,830 --> 01:03:51,660
含春药的成份
is the aphrodisiac of the self.

661
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:55,260
住在酒里的...
The green fairy...

662
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:59,570
绿仙子
who lives in the absinthe...

663
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:02,730
要你的灵魂
wants your soul.

664
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:06,670
但是
But...

665
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:10,180
你可以放心
you are safe with me.

666
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:27,790
王子...
Tell me, Prince...

667
01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:30,590
告诉我你家乡的事
tell me of your home.

668
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:37,610
全世界最美丽的地方
The most beautiful place...in all creation.

669
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:42,310
一定是
Yes, it must be.

670
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:48,380
森林
A land beyond a great,

671
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:49,950
密布
vast forest...

672
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:55,620
山峦起伏
surrounded by majestic mountains...

673
01:04:57,290 --> 01:04:59,130
葡萄园
lush vineyards...

674
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:05,570
遍地无处可比拟的
and flowers of such frailty and beauty...

675
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:08,340
妖艳花朵
as to be found nowhere else.

676
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:22,180
你说的好像亲眼看过
You've described my home...as if you had seen it firsthand.

677
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:28,890
或许受你的声调影响
It's your voice, perhaps.

678
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:31,590
好熟悉
It's so familiar.

679
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:35,230
仿佛...
It's like...

680
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:40,100
梦中无法认出的声音
It's like a voice in a dream I cannot place...

681
01:05:42,770 --> 01:05:44,760
在我孤独时
and it comforts me.

682
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:47,440
安抚我  在你孤独时
- When I am alone. - When you are alone.

683
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:12,060
王妃呢?
And what of the princess?

684
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,210
王妃?
Princess?

685
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:22,740
有王子就有王妃
There is always a princess...

686
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:27,140
穿着白衣裙
with gowns flowing white.

687
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:34,320
她的脸
And her face.

688
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:35,890
天啊
Oh, God...

689
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,230
她的脸
her face...

690
01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:44,700
是条河
is a river.

691
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,900
王妃
The princess...

692
01:06:52,910 --> 01:06:57,310
是条....充满伤痛
she's a river filled with tears of sadness...

693
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:00,740
心碎泪水的河
and heartbreak.

694
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:06,160
是有过王妃
There was a princess.

695
01:07:09,830 --> 01:07:11,160
伊丽莎白
Elisabeta.

696
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:18,430
她是全世界最耀眼的女子
She was the most radiant woman...in all the empires of the world.

697
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:29,550
谣言拆散了她与王子
Man's deceit took her from her ancient prince.

698
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:33,110
她投入...
She leapt to her death...

699
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:36,850
你提到的河而死
into the river that you spoke of.

700
01:07:38,190 --> 01:07:41,550
我的 母语...
In my mother's tongue...

701
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:47,920
那条河叫
it is called...argesh.

702
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,870
王妃河
River princess.

703
01:09:28,530 --> 01:09:29,760
亲爱的女士
Dear Madam.

704
01:09:29,830 --> 01:09:32,960
你的未婚夫在修道院(阿格莎修女8月12日之信)
Your fiance is safe and in the care...

705
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:35,440
安然无恙
of the good sisters of the Blessed Sacrament.

706
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:41,140
哈克先生认为你有生命危险
Mr. Harker believes your life is in extreme danger...

707
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:44,910
他急切希望你到此
and he desires with all urgency that you join him here...

708
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:47,920
立刻成婚
so that you may immediately be married.

709
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:50,380
祝福你
Yours with all blessings,

710
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,350
阿格莎修女上
Sister Agatha.

711
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:56,820
亲爱的王子
My sweet prince.

712
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,930
绝不能让强纳生知道
Jonathan must never know of us.

713
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,270
露西
Lucy!

714
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:10,930
我是亚拉汉梵海辛
I'm Abraham Van Helsing.

715
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:12,510
梵海辛博士
Dr. Van Helsing.

716
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:15,580
你是米娜小姐,露西的好友?
And you're Madam Mina, dear friend to our Lucy, ja?

717
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:17,100
她怎样了
How is she, doctor?

718
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:18,940
仍很虚弱
She's still very weak.

719
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:23,750
她告诉我你担心你爱的强纳生
She tells me of your beloved Jonathan Harker...and your worry for him.

720
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:26,780
我为所有的年轻爱侣担心
Well, I, too, worry for all young lovers.

721
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,950
生命中有黑暗
There are darknesses in life, my child...

722
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:35,460
也有光明
and there are lights.

723
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:38,290
你便是光明,亲爱的米娜
You are one of the lights, dear Mina...

724
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:40,730
光明中的光明
the light of all light.

725
01:10:46,210 --> 01:10:47,570
去看你的朋友吧
Go now. See your friend.

726
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:05,790
米娜
Mina.

727
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:11,160
你不太一样,米娜
You look different,Mina.

728
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:14,500
脸上发光
You look positively radiant.

729
01:11:15,110 --> 01:11:16,540
有强纳生的消息
You heard from Jonathan.

730
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:19,860
是吗?  嗯
- Didn't you? - Yes.

731
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:22,440
他平安无事,露西
He's safe,Lucy.

732
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:25,180
在罗马尼亚一家修道院
He's in a convent in Romania.

733
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:28,670
得了严重的脑热病
He's suffering from a violent brain fever.

734
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:32,250
修女替他写信
The good sisters are caring for him.They wrote to me,

735
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,580
说他需要我
and they say he needs me...

736
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:38,590
但....我不去
but I won't go.

737
01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:40,930
我不要丢下你
I'm not going to leave you.

738
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,060
米娜
Mina.

739
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:45,870
你必须去
You've got to go to him...

740
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:47,690
你要爱他
and you've got to love him...

741
01:11:48,610 --> 01:11:51,200
立刻嫁给他
and marry him right then and there.

742
01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:55,370
这个你收下
And I want you to take this, my sister.

743
01:11:56,050 --> 01:11:57,910
我送你的贺礼
It's my wedding gift to you.

744
01:11:58,050 --> 01:11:59,520
不,露西
No,Lucy.

745
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,410
别担心任性的小露西
Don't worry about spoiled little Lucy.

746
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:06,480
我会康复的
I'll be all right.

747
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:10,360
代我向强纳生致爱
Tell Jonathan oceans of love.

748
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:27,070
杰克 她怎么了?
Jack, how is she?

749
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,220
我受不了大蒜味
This is why I cannot breathe!

750
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:49,700
露西 这是药
Lucy, it's medicinal.

751
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:53,330
会助你睡得好
To help you sleep. To dream better dreams.

752
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:56,400
只是普通大蒜嘛
It's garlic! It's nothing but common garlic!

753
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:58,670
昆西来看你了
Quincey's here to see you.

754
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:00,170
拿点白兰地来
Get some brandy.

755
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:01,540
露西小姐
Now, Miss Lucy,

756
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:05,850
你好好休息,阿瑟叫我来看你
you just rest easy.Arthur sent me to take care of you.

757
01:13:06,850 --> 01:13:09,010
他说你不快好,我就得
He said if you don't get better quick...

758
01:13:09,190 --> 01:13:11,590
一枪毙了你,像对跛脚马般
I have to put you out of your misery like a lame horse.

759
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:17,190
你真野蛮
You're such a beast.

760
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,260
吻我好吗?昆西?
Will you kiss me?Quincey?

761
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:26,870
吻我
Kiss me.

762
01:13:30,110 --> 01:13:31,100
吻我
Kiss me.

763
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:36,910
老笨蛋
That old coot!

764
01:13:37,150 --> 01:13:38,740
放开我
Get off me!

765
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:41,080
露西,听我说
Lucy,Listen to me!

766
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:43,410
睡觉  快睡觉
Sleep, sleep now. Sleep.

767
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:47,820
睡吧
You're at peace.

768
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:48,980
你们看
Look. There. There.

769
01:13:55,570 --> 01:13:56,690
吸血鬼
Nosferatu.

770
01:14:02,170 --> 01:14:04,640
(吸血鬼)

771
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:13,340
此篇讲述野蛮的
"Here occurs the shocking and frightening history...

772
01:14:14,350 --> 01:14:17,340
德古拉王子骇人野史
of the wild, berserk Prince Dracula...

773
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,510
他将人插住
How he impaled people and roasted them...

774
01:14:19,690 --> 01:14:21,350
烤身、煮头
boiled their heads in a kettle...

775
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:23,860
活生生的剥皮
how he skinned them alive...

776
01:14:24,030 --> 01:14:27,360
凌迟,饮他们的血
and hacked them to pieces and then drank their blood."

777
01:14:32,270 --> 01:14:33,600
德古拉
Dracul.

778
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:37,200
血便是生命
For blood is the life.

779
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,890
亲爱的王子
"My dearest Prince,

780
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:55,890
请原谅我
forgive me.

781
01:14:56,290 --> 01:14:59,560
我收到未婚夫自罗马尼亚的信
I have received word from my fiance in Romania.

782
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:03,230
我要去见他并完婚
I am en route to join him. We are to be married.

783
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,490
永不再见
I will never see you again.

784
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:08,430
米娜上
Mina."

785
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:23,480
奇怪,那位怪友好像也跟来了
It is odd, but I feel almost...that my strange friend is with me.

786
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:26,110
他在我的思绪中
He speaks to me in my thoughts.

787
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:29,590
与他在一起我最有活力
With him I felt more alive than ever I had.

788
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:32,520
如今他不在,又将成婚
And now without him, soon to be a bride...

789
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:35,190
我深感困惑失落
I feel confused and lost.

790
01:15:35,870 --> 01:15:39,030
也许我虽想做好,其实很坏
Perhaps, though I try to be good, I am bad.

791
01:15:39,870 --> 01:15:42,700
或许我是个善变的坏女人
Perhaps I am a bad, inconstant woman.

792
01:16:01,830 --> 01:16:03,220
飓风！
Winds!

793
01:16:04,230 --> 01:16:05,820
飓风！
Winds!

794
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:10,990
刮大风吧！
Winds!

795
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,560
就是这原因
It is the cause.

796
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:18,500
就是它
It is the cause of my soul!

797
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:20,670
天啊!德古拉
It is Dracula...

798
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:22,570
这个僵尸
the undead...

799
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:25,780
我一生追击的敌人
the foe I have pursued all my life.

800
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:32,120
德古拉!
Dracula!

801
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:37,350
杰克,快有好多事要告诉你
Jack, hurry! I have much to tell you.

802
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,590
小心守候
Guard her well, Mr. Morris.

803
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,860
今晚不得失误
Do not fail here tonight.

804
01:16:44,030 --> 01:16:49,360
我们对抗的是超越凡人的法力
We are dealing with forces beyond all human experience...an enormous power, so guard her well.

805
01:16:49,710 --> 01:16:53,400
若不尽责你的露西将会成女妖
Otherwise your precious Lucy will become a bitch of the devil...

806
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:55,270
邪恶的魔女
a whore of darkness!

807
01:16:57,350 --> 01:16:58,870
老疯子
You're a sick old buzzard.

808
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:02,280
听清楚,小子
Hear me out, young man.

809
01:17:02,450 --> 01:17:05,090
露西不是意外所致
Lucy is not a random victim attacked by mere accident.

810
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:06,750
明白了吗?   不
Do you understand? No.

811
01:17:06,820 --> 01:17:10,820
她自愿受其蛊惑
She is a willing recruit, a breathless, wanton follower.

812
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:13,390
忠实的门徒
I dare say, a devoted disciple.

813
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:16,050
她是魔鬼的姘妇
She is the devil's concubine!

814
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,160
懂了吗
Do you understand me?

815
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:24,200
但我们仍可救回她的魂
Yet, we may still save her precious soul.

816
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:28,970
但...得先填饱肚子,杰克
But not on an empty stomach.

817
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:30,230
杰克  是的,先生
- Jack! - Here, sir.

818
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:33,510
我饿死了,快跟我去吃
I starve. Feed me.

819
01:17:34,420 --> 01:17:35,710
老傻子！
You old coot!

820
01:19:50,810 --> 01:19:54,140
无能的人类跟愚蠢的驱邪物
Your impotent men with their foolish spells...

821
01:19:54,310 --> 01:19:57,870
保护不了你
cannot protect you from my power.

822
01:20:10,690 --> 01:20:13,490
我诅咒你成为僵尸
I condemn you to living death...

823
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:16,930
永远
to eternal hunger...

824
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:21,770
嗜饮...鲜血
for living blood.

825
01:21:46,390 --> 01:21:47,380
杰克
Jack!

826
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:57,660
我知道你深爱她
I know how deeply you loved her.

827
01:21:57,870 --> 01:21:59,600
所以你得相信
That is why you must trust me and believe.

828
01:21:59,670 --> 01:22:01,660
叫我如何相信?
Believe? How can I believe?

829
01:22:01,940 --> 01:22:05,770
你在天黑前带解剖刀来
I want you to bring me, before nightfall, a set of postmortem knives.

830
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:07,700
解剖?露西
An autopsy? Lucy?

831
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:11,540
不算,我要割她的头挖她的心
No, not exactly. I just want to cut off her head and take out her heart.

832
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:21,950
9月17日,日记
Diary, 17th September.

833
01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:23,820
可怜的强纳生
Poor Jonathan.

834
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:25,960
他仍重病
He's still so ill.

835
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:29,060
但回到伦敦他很开心
He's cheered by the familiar streets in London.

836
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:33,490
而我,因露西已死反而难过
For me, now that Lucy is dead, it is a sad homecoming.

837
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:37,500
仿佛部份的我也已死去
It is as if a part of me is dead too...

838
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:40,400
除了暗盼
except for the tiny hope that lives in me...

839
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:43,070
能再见到我的王子
that I will again see my prince.

840
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:44,740
他在伦敦吗?
Is he here?

841
01:22:45,850 --> 01:22:46,980
我已结婚,
Now that I am married...

842
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:51,090
才明白对萦绣山中的他
I begin to understand the nature of my feelings for my strange friend...

843
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:53,420
是怎样的情绪
who is always in my thoughts.

844
01:23:04,670 --> 01:23:06,600
强纳生,怎么了?
Jonathan, what is it?

845
01:23:06,770 --> 01:23:08,670
就是他
It is the man himself.

846
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,930
他变年轻了
Look, he's grown young.

847
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:56,110
各位
Gentlemen,

848
01:23:57,250 --> 01:23:59,320
非掘露西的墓不可吗?
must we desecrate poor Lucy's grave?

849
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:01,260
她死得够惨了
She died horribly enough.

850
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:07,190
若她已死则无碍
If Miss Lucy is dead, then no wrong can be done to her.

851
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:08,950
若没死
But if she's not dead...

852
01:24:09,970 --> 01:24:12,200
你是说她被活埋?
What are you saying, man? That she's been buried alive?

853
01:24:12,730 --> 01:24:15,360
不,我只是说
No. All I say is

854
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,290
她没死
she is undead.

855
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:19,630
没死
Undead.

856
01:24:19,980 --> 01:24:21,530
这真疯狂
This is insane.

857
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:43,120
各位 动手吧
Gentlemen, shall we?

858
01:24:43,330 --> 01:24:45,730
一、二、三
One, two, three.

859
01:25:03,090 --> 01:25:04,420
她呢?
Where is she?

860
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:07,910
她呢?
Where is she?

861
01:25:09,260 --> 01:25:10,590
你把她怎么了
What have you done with her?

862
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:16,930
她住在上帝恩典不及之处飘荡在黑暗界
She lives beyond the grace of God...a wanderer in the outer darkness.

863
01:25:16,930 --> 01:25:19,730
她是吸血鬼
She is vampyre, nosferatu.

864
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:25,600
这些怪物被吸血后不会死
These creatures do not die like the bee after the first sting...

865
01:25:25,770 --> 01:25:28,770
反受传染而成不朽
but instead grow strong and become immortal...once infected by another nosferatu.

866
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:35,840
所以,吾友
So my friends,

867
01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:38,280
我们不是对抗一个怪物
we fight not one beast...

868
01:25:38,350 --> 01:25:43,350
而是长久流传以血为生的族群
but legions that go on age after age after age...feeding on the blood of the living.

869
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:50,960
快躲起来
Quickly, hide. Now.

870
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,460
露西
Lucy!

871
01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:22,590
露西
Lucy!

872
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:30,500
来,阿瑟
Come to me, Arthur.

873
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:34,840
扔下其它人,来我这里
Leave these others and come to me.

874
01:26:36,850 --> 01:26:39,780
我好想拥抱你
My arms are hungry for you, my darling.

875
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:43,580
吻我,抱我
Kiss me and caress me...

876
01:26:43,890 --> 01:26:46,080
我亲爱的丈夫,我求你
my darling husband, please.

877
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,850
我们有十字架和圣水
We wave Christ and His holy blood!

878
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:51,680
我们在主内坚强
We are strong in the Lord and

879
01:26:51,860 --> 01:26:55,020
主赋与我们力量
the power of His might!

880
01:26:56,260 --> 01:26:59,860
主赋与我们力量
The power of God is upon us!

881
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:02,700
主赋与我们力量
The power of God is upon us!

882
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:06,630
主赋与我们力量
The power of God is upon us!

883
01:27:10,310 --> 01:27:12,870
我将你带至光明
I bring you from shadow into light!

884
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:17,610
黑暗王子,我将你逐至地狱
I cast you out, the prince of darkness...into hell!

885
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:23,260
只需片刻勇气,
A moment's courage, and it is done.

886
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:25,190
左手拿凿子
Take the stake in your left hand...

887
01:27:27,130 --> 01:27:29,060
对准心脏
place the point over the heart.

888
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:36,130
奉主之名,敲下去
Then in God's name, strike. Do it now!

889
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:53,580
吃呀,大餐
Eat, feast.

890
01:27:54,090 --> 01:27:56,750
将来你们需要力气
You'll need your strength for the dark days ahead.

891
01:27:57,430 --> 01:27:58,420
米娜
Mina?

892
01:27:59,930 --> 01:28:01,090
博士 嗯?
- Doctor? - Ja?

893
01:28:02,830 --> 01:28:04,320
露西怎么死的？
How did Lucy die?

894
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:08,790
这个...
Well...

895
01:28:10,610 --> 01:28:12,040
她死前痛苦吗？
Was she in great pain?

896
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:14,770
是的,我们砍掉她的头
Ja, she was in great pain. Then we cut off her head...

897
01:28:15,110 --> 01:28:18,380
在心脏钉下十字架,她就安息了
and drove a stake through her heart and burned it and then she found peace.

898
01:28:18,510 --> 01:28:21,510
博士  拜托别说了
Doctor! Please.

899
01:28:25,450 --> 01:28:26,790
哈克先生
So, Mr. Harker...

900
01:28:27,620 --> 01:28:30,520
身为你的医生,问你个
I must now ask you, as your doctor...

901
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:34,890
敏感问题
a sensitive question.

902
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:39,060
你和那些怪物在一起时
During your infidelity with those creatures...those demonic women...

903
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:41,450
可曾吃过
did you, for one instant,

904
01:28:41,470 --> 01:28:42,800
她们的血
taste of their blood?

905
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:45,000
没有
No!

906
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:50,010
没有?
No?

907
01:28:51,210 --> 01:28:52,200
没有
No!

908
01:28:54,650 --> 01:28:55,780
很好
Good!

909
01:28:56,280 --> 01:29:01,120
那你没染上露西那种病
Then you have not infected your blood with the terrible...disease that destroyed poor Lucy.

910
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:12,160
博士,你要知道
Doctor, you must understand.

911
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:16,060
以前我疑幻似真
I doubted everything...

912
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:18,070
甚至以为自己疯了
even my mind.

913
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:20,300
终日恐惧
I was impotent with fear.

914
01:29:20,810 --> 01:29:21,900
我知道  但是
- I know. - But, sir...

915
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:26,970
我知道吸血鬼睡在哪
I know where the bastard sleeps.

916
01:29:27,150 --> 01:29:28,810
我把他带到
I brought him there,

917
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:30,910
卡费教堂
to Carfax Abbey.

918
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:36,250
吸血鬼的确存在
Vampires do exist.

919
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:40,320
我们围攻的这一个
And this one we fight, this one we face...

920
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:43,160
有二十人的力气
has the strength of 20 or more people...

921
01:29:43,330 --> 01:29:45,390
你可以证明
and you can testify for that, Mr. Harker.

922
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:50,740
他能控制低等的蝙蝠、鼠狼
But he can also control the meaner things of life...the bat, the rodent, the wolf.

923
01:29:50,740 --> 01:29:54,940
可化为烟雾遁形
He can appear as mist, as vapor, as fog and vanish at will.

924
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:58,010
德古拉法力很大,
Now, all these things Dracula can do...

925
01:29:58,010 --> 01:29:59,680
但他不自由
but he is not free.

926
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:03,080
他必须躺在故土中增加魔力
He must rest in the sacred earth of his homeland to gain his evil power.

927
01:30:03,250 --> 01:30:06,190
我们必须在此将他毁灭
It is here that we must find him and destroy him utterly.

928
01:30:07,090 --> 01:30:10,350
我替这个伯爵难过
I almost feel pity for anything so hunted as this count.

929
01:30:10,490 --> 01:30:12,480
你怎会怜悯这种怪物
How can you pity such a creature?

930
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:15,790
我带米娜去我的医院
I'll take Mina to my quarters.

931
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:17,930
你在那儿才安全
Good. You'll be safer there.

932
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:24,600
子弹伤不了他,
Mr. Morris, your bullets will not harm him.

933
01:30:24,770 --> 01:30:27,040
一定得砍头 我建议你用猎刀
He must be beheaded. I suggest you use your big bowie knife.

934
01:30:27,210 --> 01:30:30,200
我不打算贴近他,博士
Well, I wasn't plannin' on getting that close, Doc.

935
01:30:31,310 --> 01:30:32,710
主人！
Master!

936
01:30:34,450 --> 01:30:35,880
主人
Master!

937
01:30:37,450 --> 01:30:38,850
主人...
Master!

938
01:30:49,460 --> 01:30:51,230
杰克大夫
Dr. Jack!

939
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,160
我获准得永生
I've been promised eternal life!

940
01:30:57,340 --> 01:30:58,330
杰克
Dr. Seward,

941
01:30:58,410 --> 01:30:59,960
那人是谁
who is that man?

942
01:31:00,140 --> 01:31:02,540
那是伦费先生,你不适合久留
Mr. Renfield. This is no place for you, Madam Mina.

943
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:06,140
伦费?我得见他
Renfield? I must see him.

944
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:08,470
伦费先生
Mr. Renfield,

945
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:10,480
别乱来
behave yourself.

946
01:31:12,820 --> 01:31:14,760
这位是哈克太太
This is Mrs. Harker.

947
01:31:16,490 --> 01:31:17,750
晚安
Good evening.

948
01:31:17,930 --> 01:31:19,830
晚安,伦费先生
Good evening, Mr. Renfield.

949
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:23,020
我太调皮了
It seems I've been rather naughty.

950
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:27,030
我认识你
I know you.

951
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:29,440
你是主人的新娘
You're the bride my master covets.

952
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:34,270
我有丈夫了
I have a husband.

953
01:31:34,710 --> 01:31:36,370
我是哈克太太
I am Mrs. Harker.

954
01:31:37,710 --> 01:31:40,240
我的主人提过你
My master tells me about you.

955
01:31:41,780 --> 01:31:43,110
他怎么说?
What does he tell you?

956
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:45,950
说他要来
That he is coming.

957
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:49,510
他要来找你
That he is coming for you.

958
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:52,690
过来点
Oh, please.

959
01:31:58,670 --> 01:32:00,690
别留在这
Don't stay here.

960
01:32:01,370 --> 01:32:03,860
离开这些人
Get away from these men,

961
01:32:04,140 --> 01:32:05,470
求求你
please.

962
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:10,810
我祈求主不要再见到你
And I pray to God I may never see your sweet face again.

963
01:32:14,650 --> 01:32:17,310
愿主祝福保佑你
And may the Lord bless and keep you.

964
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:30,250
主人！
Master!

965
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:32,000
主人
Master!

966
01:32:32,430 --> 01:32:35,100
你答应我让我永生的
You promised me eternal life...

967
01:32:35,570 --> 01:32:38,270
你却给了这名美女
but you give it to the pretty woman!

968
01:32:38,770 --> 01:32:40,100
杰克大夫
Dr. Jack!

969
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:42,830
我不是疯子
I'm no lunatic man!

970
01:32:43,010 --> 01:32:45,910
我很正常,在为灵魂奋战
I'm a sane man fighting for his soul!

971
01:32:46,110 --> 01:32:49,450
我的房间很简陋,但很舒适
My quarters are spare, but I think you will find them comfortable.

972
01:32:50,450 --> 01:32:52,010
杰克大夫
Dr. Jack!

973
01:32:52,290 --> 01:32:54,850
有水和清洁用品
Water and toiletries at your disposal.

974
01:32:57,430 --> 01:32:59,590
你在这十分安全
You'll be completely safe here.

975
01:34:01,820 --> 01:34:03,480
毁掉每个箱子
Destroy every box.

976
01:34:03,660 --> 01:34:05,720
浇圣水
Sterilize the earth inside.

977
01:34:05,930 --> 01:34:07,420
让他无处可逃
Leave him no refuge.

978
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,990
开始驱魔
Let the exorcism begin.

979
01:34:36,790 --> 01:34:38,120
伦费
Renfield.

980
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:42,220
你背叛了我
You have betrayed me.

981
01:34:43,830 --> 01:34:45,060
没有
No.

982
01:34:46,630 --> 01:34:48,530
主人,我没有
No, master.

983
01:34:50,170 --> 01:34:51,760
我没有
No.

984
01:34:52,570 --> 01:34:54,410
我侍奉你
I serve you.

985
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:57,480
我只侍奉你
I serve only you.

986
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:57,740
吾爱
Oh, yes, my love.

987
01:35:58,940 --> 01:36:00,930
你找到我了
You've found me.

988
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:06,410
我最珍贵的生命
My most precious life.

989
01:36:06,850 --> 01:36:09,280
我要这事发生
I have wanted this to happen.

990
01:36:10,020 --> 01:36:12,010
我都知道了
I know that now.

991
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:16,880
我要永远和你在一起
I want to be with you always.

992
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:20,360
你不明白自己在说什么
You cannot know what you are saying.

993
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:24,220
是的
Yes...

994
01:36:24,370 --> 01:36:26,030
我知道
I do know.

995
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:42,650
我怕再也感受不到你的触摸
I feared I would never feel your touch again.

996
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:45,250
我以为你死了
I thought you were dead.

997
01:36:52,490 --> 01:36:56,720
这躯壳里没有生命
There is no life in this body.

998
01:37:00,570 --> 01:37:02,230
但你活着
But you live.

999
01:37:04,140 --> 01:37:05,730
你是活的
You live.

1000
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,670
你到底是什么?
What are you?

1001
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:14,510
我要知道 你一定得告诉我
I must know. You must tell me.

1002
01:37:21,690 --> 01:37:22,850
我...
I am...

1003
01:37:25,030 --> 01:37:26,360
什么都不是
nothing.

1004
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:29,020
没有生命
Lifeless.

1005
01:37:30,530 --> 01:37:31,860
没有灵魂
Soulless.

1006
01:37:32,030 --> 01:37:33,430
什么意思
What do you mean?

1007
01:37:33,670 --> 01:37:35,660
人皆恨我怕我
Hated and feared.

1008
01:37:36,970 --> 01:37:40,130
我在世上已死
I am dead to all the world.

1009
01:37:40,340 --> 01:37:41,740
听好
Hear me.

1010
01:37:43,980 --> 01:37:45,540
我是
I am the monster...

1011
01:37:45,750 --> 01:37:48,650
众人皆欲杀之的怪物
that breathing men would kill.

1012
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:52,120
我就是德古拉
I am Dracula.

1013
01:38:08,140 --> 01:38:10,400
你杀死露西!
You murdered Lucy!

1014
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:13,470
天啊
God!

1015
01:38:23,150 --> 01:38:24,980
我爱你
I love you.

1016
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:30,550
上帝 原谅我,我爱你
Oh, God, forgive me, I do.

1017
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:52,480
我要变得和你一样
I want to be what you are...

1018
01:38:52,750 --> 01:38:56,150
见你所见,爱你所爱
see what you see...Iove what you love.

1019
01:38:57,620 --> 01:38:58,740
米娜
Mina.

1020
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:01,650
想和我一样
To walk with me...

1021
01:39:02,390 --> 01:39:05,620
你必须死亡
you must die to your breathing life...

1022
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:07,770
在我的世界重生
and be reborn to mine.

1023
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,160
你永远是我的爱
You are my love...

1024
01:39:12,430 --> 01:39:14,900
与生命
and my life always.

1025
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:23,900
那么...
Then...

1026
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:27,010
我将让你永生
I give you life eternal...

1027
01:39:29,180 --> 01:39:31,010
给你长久不息的爱
everlasting love...

1028
01:39:32,690 --> 01:39:35,780
教你 呼风唤雨
the power of the storm...

1029
01:39:36,790 --> 01:39:39,120
降兽驯禽
and the beasts of the earth.

1030
01:39:40,360 --> 01:39:41,920
跟我走
Walk with me...

1031
01:39:42,530 --> 01:39:46,590
永远为我爱妻
to be my loving wife forever.

1032
01:39:46,770 --> 01:39:48,130
我愿意
I will. Yes. Yes.

1033
01:40:20,370 --> 01:40:23,300
喝下去 同我迈入
Drink and join me...

1034
01:40:24,710 --> 01:40:26,700
永生
in eternal life.

1035
01:40:40,420 --> 01:40:43,760
不,我不能害你
I cannot let this be.

1036
01:40:45,490 --> 01:40:48,120
我不在乎,占有我吧
Please, I don't care. Make me yours.

1037
01:40:48,260 --> 01:40:52,720
米娜,你将让我永世
You will be cursed as I am to walk in the shadow of death...

1038
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:55,270
被诅咒
for all eternity.

1039
01:40:56,340 --> 01:40:59,000
我太爱你
I love you too much...

1040
01:40:59,810 --> 01:41:01,100
而不能害你
to condemn you.

1041
01:41:02,340 --> 01:41:06,470
带我远离死亡阴影
Then take me away from all this death.

1042
01:41:52,590 --> 01:41:53,920
米娜
Mina.

1043
01:42:04,070 --> 01:42:06,630
你以为十字架
You think you can destroy me...

1044
01:42:07,070 --> 01:42:09,240
可以杀死我?
with your idols?

1045
01:42:12,810 --> 01:42:15,010
拿圣水
Sacred blood of Christ!

1046
01:42:15,250 --> 01:42:17,810
我服侍十字架
I, who served the cross.

1047
01:42:18,350 --> 01:42:20,680
在数百年前
I, who commanded nations...

1048
01:42:20,860 --> 01:42:23,450
我曾领导万军
hundreds of years before you were born.

1049
01:42:23,790 --> 01:42:25,780
你的军队溃败
Your armies were defeated.

1050
01:42:26,530 --> 01:42:27,860
你折磨...
You tortured and

1051
01:42:28,060 --> 01:42:30,120
刑罚千万人
impaled thousands of people.

1052
01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:33,460
我被背弃
I was betrayed.

1053
01:42:33,730 --> 01:42:35,070
看...
Look

1054
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:36,790
你的上帝
what your God...

1055
01:42:37,070 --> 01:42:39,470
如何对待我
has done to me.

1056
01:42:39,810 --> 01:42:43,540
你与上帝的战争已结束  伏法吧
No, your war with God is over. You must pay for your crimes.

1057
01:42:47,980 --> 01:42:49,310
基督制伏你
Christ compels you!

1058
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:51,420
现在她是...
She is now...

1059
01:42:53,050 --> 01:42:56,390
我的新娘了
my bride!

1060
01:43:01,230 --> 01:43:02,490
灯火
More light!

1061
01:43:04,630 --> 01:43:05,830
灯火
Light!

1062
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:08,160
不够
More light!

1063
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:18,340
好脏
Unclean.

1064
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:20,670
捉住那些老鼠
- Get them! - This way!

1065
01:43:20,850 --> 01:43:22,210
得烧掉
- Get them! - They must be found.

1066
01:43:22,380 --> 01:43:23,370
好脏
Unclean.

1067
01:43:24,050 --> 01:43:25,990
我们学到很多
We have learned something much.

1068
01:43:26,250 --> 01:43:27,980
德古拉怕我们
Dracula fears us.

1069
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:29,710
他怕时间
He fears time.

1070
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:32,720
否则何必匆匆逃走
For, if not, why does he hurry so?

1071
01:43:33,260 --> 01:43:35,250
他走了
He is gone.

1072
01:43:36,060 --> 01:43:37,500
你怎么知道?
How do you know?

1073
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:40,930
他告诉我的
He speaks to me.

1074
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:45,000
他和你心灵相通
He has a strong mind connection to you.

1075
01:43:47,110 --> 01:43:50,040
他的心脏强壮,熬的住死亡
His heart was strong enough to survive the grave.

1076
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:53,310
你赞赏他
- You admire him. - Ja.

1077
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:58,180
他生前是个伟人
He was, in life, a most remarkable man...

1078
01:43:59,190 --> 01:44:01,850
思虑恢宏
and his mind was great and powerful...

1079
01:44:02,060 --> 01:44:04,960
但更重要的是
but greater is the necessity to stamp him out...

1080
01:44:05,130 --> 01:44:07,250
让他永不超生
and destroy him utterly.

1081
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:10,100
博士  嗯?
- Doctor? - Ja?

1082
01:44:13,230 --> 01:44:16,000
我知道我愈来愈像他
I know that I am becoming like him.

1083
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,470
你的救赎是他的毁灭
Your salvation is his destruction.

1084
01:44:20,570 --> 01:44:23,410
所以我要催眠你
That is why I want to hypnotize you.

1085
01:44:24,350 --> 01:44:26,750
我要你及时
I want you to help me find him before it is too late.

1086
01:44:27,250 --> 01:44:31,340
助我找到他  请帮我找到他
Please, help me find him. Please.

1087
01:44:32,150 --> 01:44:33,920
看这烛光
Look into this light...

1088
01:44:34,590 --> 01:44:37,350
光明中的光明
the light of all light, into this flame.

1089
01:44:38,590 --> 01:44:40,420
你双眼沉重
Your eyes are heavy.

1090
01:44:42,030 --> 01:44:45,260
你想睡觉  睡吧
You want to sleep. Sleep now.

1091
01:44:47,970 --> 01:44:49,600
睡吧
Sleep.

1092
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:52,640
我要去找他,他在叫我
I must go to him.He calls.

1093
01:44:54,180 --> 01:44:55,510
你听到什么
What do you hear?

1094
01:44:58,010 --> 01:45:00,450
听到什么
What do you hear, child?

1095
01:45:01,550 --> 01:45:04,250
听到什么
What do you hear?

1096
01:45:05,450 --> 01:45:07,790
我的王子在呼唤我
Oh, my prince is calling me.

1097
01:45:08,290 --> 01:45:12,280
他飘洋过海
He is traveling across icy seas to his beloved home.

1098
01:45:13,090 --> 01:45:15,760
回家滋长力量
There he will grow strong again.

1099
01:45:16,360 --> 01:45:19,630
我要去找他分享他的力量
I am coming to him to partake of his strength.

1100
01:45:26,010 --> 01:45:30,570
我们当晚在波涛中航过英吉利海峡
We left London by train and crossed the English Channel in stormy seas...

1101
01:45:30,910 --> 01:45:33,900
风浪无疑是伯爵的杰作
no doubt from the passage of the count's ship.

1102
01:45:34,350 --> 01:45:36,250
他呼风唤雨
He commands the winds,

1103
01:45:36,450 --> 01:45:38,580
但我们仍占上风
but we still have the advantage.

1104
01:45:38,790 --> 01:45:42,350
搭火车三天内可抵达瓦纳
By train, we can reach the Romanian port at Varna in three days.

1105
01:45:42,790 --> 01:45:45,050
搭船至少要一周
By ship, it will take him at least a week.

1106
01:45:46,530 --> 01:45:49,520
从巴黎经阿尔卑斯至布达佩斯
From Paris, we traveled through the Alps to Budapest.

1107
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:54,360
伯爵一定得经直布罗陀 我们已派人看守
The count must sail around the Rock of Gibraltar...where we have posted a lookout...

1108
01:45:54,540 --> 01:45:57,200
至黑海瓦纳港
and then on to the Black Sea port in Varna...

1109
01:45:57,370 --> 01:46:00,600
我们在瓦纳与他碰头将船烧毁
where we will meet his ship and burn it into the sea.

1110
01:46:06,850 --> 01:46:10,150
回家
Home. Home.

1111
01:46:19,890 --> 01:46:22,830
吸血鬼以血为她受洗
The vampire's baptized her with his own blood...

1112
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,660
她已成吸血鬼
and her blood is dying, my friend.

1113
01:46:25,330 --> 01:46:26,890
没办法了
It is no use.

1114
01:46:39,250 --> 01:46:42,340
我不让你只身入险地
I will not let you go into the unknown alone.

1115
01:46:42,620 --> 01:46:46,950
可怜的强纳生
Oh, my poor, dear Jonathan.

1116
01:46:47,150 --> 01:46:49,590
我对不起你
Oh, what have I done to you?

1117
01:46:51,260 --> 01:46:54,350
不,是我害了我们俩
No, I have done this to both of us.

1118
01:46:54,530 --> 01:46:56,930
我听到他了,他接近了
I can hear him. He's coming closer.

1119
01:46:57,100 --> 01:46:59,330
他在呼唤我
He's calling me to him.

1120
01:46:59,900 --> 01:47:02,370
米娜,米娜
Mina!Mina!

1121
01:47:03,670 --> 01:47:05,100
留下来
Stay with me.

1122
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:06,170
求求你
Please.

1123
01:47:06,410 --> 01:47:07,900
我好冷
I am so cold.

1124
01:47:20,550 --> 01:47:21,710
上车
All aboard!

1125
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:26,150
正午,荷伍接到公司的电报
Noon. Holmwood received a wire from his clerk at Lloyd's.

1126
01:47:26,290 --> 01:47:30,890
伯爵的船在夜雾中赶过我们
The count's ship sailed past us in the night fog...to the northern port of Galatz.

1127
01:47:31,070 --> 01:47:33,900
这个魔鬼在探索米娜的思想
The black devil is reading Mina's mind.

1128
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:36,490
怎么捉他
How can we catch him now?

1129
01:47:44,910 --> 01:47:45,900
瓦纳港
Varna. Galatz.

1130
01:47:46,180 --> 01:47:51,420
格拉兹 约两百里  骑马可在他...
It's about 200 miles.I think that with the horses, we can cut him off...

1131
01:47:51,420 --> 01:47:53,580
抵达古堡前拦截他
reach him before he reaches the castle.

1132
01:47:53,750 --> 01:47:56,720
我会派梵海辛到波戈隘口
I will dispatch Van Helsing straight for the Borgo Pass.

1133
01:47:57,060 --> 01:47:58,520
若我们失败,
If we fail in our task...

1134
01:47:58,530 --> 01:48:00,460
你一定得杀掉他
you will have to finish him.

1135
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:08,530
米娜和梵海辛在瓦纳搭马车
From Varna, Mina and Van Helsing took a carriage...

1136
01:48:08,670 --> 01:48:11,000
我们朝格拉兹前进
and we continued on the train towards Galatz...

1137
01:48:11,210 --> 01:48:14,770
希望能在他登陆前拦截到
where we still hoped to intercept the count before he reaches land.

1138
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:17,070
我为米娜害怕
I am fearful for Mina.

1139
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:19,750
她是诱饵
She is now our decoy.

1140
01:48:32,690 --> 01:48:34,420
我认得这地方
I know this place.

1141
01:48:34,700 --> 01:48:37,430
世界的尽头  我们得继续走
- The end of the world. - We must go on.

1142
01:48:37,630 --> 01:48:39,860
天晚了,休息吧
It is late, child. We must rest here now.

1143
01:48:40,270 --> 01:48:41,200
我们得走
No, we must go!

1144
01:48:41,270 --> 01:48:42,030
米娜
Mina!

1145
01:48:42,100 --> 01:48:43,760
他需要我,非得走
He needs me. We must go!

1146
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:50,430
我们已经过毕斯屈栅
We have passed Bistritza.

1147
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:52,980
德古拉又赢过我们
Dracula has outsmarted us again.

1148
01:48:53,110 --> 01:48:56,780
我们得知箱子在格拉兹被运走
We learned that his gypsies took charge of the vampire's box at Galatz...

1149
01:48:57,050 --> 01:48:59,610
已在波戈隘口的路上
and are now on the Borgo Pass road.

1150
01:49:16,570 --> 01:49:18,330
你一定得吃
Here. You must eat.

1151
01:49:18,540 --> 01:49:20,030
我不饿
I am not hungry.

1152
01:49:23,710 --> 01:49:24,840
米娜
Mina!

1153
01:50:12,460 --> 01:50:15,360
你对我很好,教授
You have been so good to me, Professor.

1154
01:50:24,810 --> 01:50:27,870
我知道露西暗恋你
I know that Lucy harbored secret desires for you.

1155
01:50:28,810 --> 01:50:30,280
她告诉我的
She told me.

1156
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:33,940
我也知道男人要什么
I, too, know what men desire.

1157
01:50:51,300 --> 01:50:53,320
你会砍我头
Will you cut off my head...

1158
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:58,570
用十字架穿我的心吗?你这凶手
and drive a stake through my heart...as you did poor Lucy, you murdering bastard?

1159
01:51:02,580 --> 01:51:04,100
绝不会
Not while I live.

1160
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:06,010
我发誓要保护你
I am sworn to protect you.

1161
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:21,950
不
No!

1162
01:51:23,400 --> 01:51:25,300
你在圈内很安全
You are safe within the circle.

1163
01:51:25,470 --> 01:51:26,870
我已输掉露西
I've lost Lucy.

1164
01:51:27,130 --> 01:51:28,800
不能再将你输给他
I'll not lose you to him.

1165
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,330
撒旦的臭婊子
You're whores of Satan!

1166
01:51:34,780 --> 01:51:36,680
这里是圣地
This is holy ground.

1167
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:38,570
立刻走开
Leave this place now!

1168
01:51:40,780 --> 01:51:41,910
走！
Leave!

1169
01:51:43,450 --> 01:51:46,220
奉主之名 离开这块圣地
In the name of God, leave this ground!

1170
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:48,710
我以基督的名义命令你们!
I command you in the name of Christ!

1171
01:51:53,390 --> 01:51:54,380
不...
No...

1172
01:51:56,330 --> 01:51:57,520
不...
No...

1173
01:52:00,270 --> 01:52:02,260
主啊!该死
Christ! Damn you!

1174
01:52:40,540 --> 01:52:42,030
德古拉
Dracul!

1175
01:52:44,580 --> 01:52:46,240
德古拉！
Dracul!

1176
01:53:18,810 --> 01:53:20,210
米娜
Mina!

1177
01:53:21,110 --> 01:53:25,550
你就在附近了
You are...near.

1178
01:53:25,550 --> 01:53:26,710
吾爱
My love.

1179
01:53:39,700 --> 01:53:41,070
他们要在日落前赶到
They're racing against the sunset.

1180
01:53:41,900 --> 01:53:43,060
也许已经来不及
It may be too late. God help us.

1181
01:54:15,340 --> 01:54:16,390
米娜
Mina!

1182
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:25,970
开枪
Harker, shoot!

1183
01:54:34,760 --> 01:54:36,020
攻呀
Charge!

1184
01:55:19,670 --> 01:55:20,720
昆西
Quincey!

1185
01:56:33,670 --> 01:56:34,400
不
No!

1186
01:56:40,810 --> 01:56:41,800
米娜
Mina!

1187
01:56:59,900 --> 01:57:00,760
昆西
Quincey!

1188
01:57:05,310 --> 01:57:06,100
不
No!

1189
01:57:10,980 --> 01:57:11,640
不要
No!

1190
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:20,750
当你要杀我时你下的了手吗?
When my time comes, will you do the same to me?

1191
01:57:23,990 --> 01:57:24,980
你会吗?
Will you?

1192
01:57:31,130 --> 01:57:33,170
不,放他们走
- Wait. - Let them go.

1193
01:57:33,170 --> 01:57:37,100
我们的工作到此为止
Let them go. Our work is finished here.

1194
01:57:37,600 --> 01:57:39,230
她的工作才刚开始
Hers has just begun.

1195
01:57:50,280 --> 01:57:51,080
昆西
Quincey.

1196
01:58:03,430 --> 01:58:05,920
我们都成了上帝的疯子
We've all become God's madmen.

1197
01:58:08,540 --> 01:58:10,130
我们都是
All of us.

1198
01:58:19,880 --> 01:58:21,870
我的上帝呢
Where is my God?

1199
01:58:23,980 --> 01:58:26,650
他抛弃了我们
He has forsaken me.

1200
01:58:33,330 --> 01:58:35,320
结束了
It is finished.

1201
01:58:36,060 --> 01:58:37,050
不
No.

1202
01:58:38,570 --> 01:58:39,900
吾爱
My love.

1203
01:58:45,010 --> 01:58:46,170
吾爱
My love.

1204
01:58:54,580 --> 01:58:56,240
在上帝面前
There, in the presence of God...

1205
01:58:57,120 --> 01:58:58,450
我终于了解
I understood at last how my love could release us all...

1206
01:58:58,620 --> 01:59:02,450
我的爱让我们脱离黑暗魔咒
from the powers of darkness.

1207
01:59:08,630 --> 01:59:11,290
我们的爱比死更强大
Our love is stronger than death.

1208
01:59:19,310 --> 01:59:22,070
让我安息
Give me peace.
