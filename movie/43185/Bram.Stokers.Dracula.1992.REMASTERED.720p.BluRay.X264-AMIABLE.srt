1
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:34,031
God be praised. I am victorious.

2
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,256
She has taken her own life.

3
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,597
Her soul cannot be saved.

4
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,131
She is damned.

5
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,809
It is God's law.

6
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,973
Is this my reward for
defending God's church?

7
00:04:24,975 --> 00:04:26,598
Sacrilege!

8
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,427
I renounce God!

9
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:35,273
I shall rise from
my own death...

10
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:39,652
...to avenge hers with all
the powers of darkness.

11
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:00,418
The blood is the life...

12
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:05,438
...and it shall be mine!

13
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:11,677
For the dead travel fast.

14
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:29,131
How dare you touch him!
He belongs to me!

15
00:34:29,725 --> 00:34:34,289
You yourself never loved.

16
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:40,017
Yes. I too can love.

17
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:45,687
And I shall love again.

18
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,967
Are we to have nothing tonight?
