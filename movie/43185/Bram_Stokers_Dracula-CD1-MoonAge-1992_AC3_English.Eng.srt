1
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,910
The year, 1462.
Constantinople had fallen.

2
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:54,790
Moslem Turks swept into Europe,
threatening all of Christendom.

3
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,230
From Transylvania arose
a Romanian knight.

4
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,750
Dracula.

5
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:24,950
On the eve of the battle,
his bride, Elizabetha,

6
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,190
knew that he must face
an insurmountable force

7
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,240
from which he might never return.

8
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,150
Elizabetha...

9
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:50,400
The vengeful Turks
shot a message into the castle.

10
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,030
It told of Dracula’s death.

11
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:58,830
Elizabetha, believing him dead,
flung herself into the river.

12
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:40,150
My prince is dead.
All is lost without him.

13
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:44,070
May God unite us in heaven.

14
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:55,230
I've done everything
you asked, Master.

15
00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:00,190
All the preparations are in order.
Everything.

16
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:04,750
I await your command, for I know

17
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,880
that when the rewards are given,

18
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:14,150
I will be one of those
who benefits from your generosity.

19
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,960
Thank you.

20
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,790
Renfield is deranged.

21
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:30,070
He's lost his mind, poor chap.
Take over his foreign client,

22
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,480
this eccentric Count Dracula.
He's buying up property in London.

23
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,310
Of course, sir.
Thank you for your confidence.

24
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:44,430
This is a great opportunity, Harker.
Leave for Transylvania immediately.

25
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:50,510
Opportunities such as this
come but once in a lifetime.

26
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:56,030
May I enquire, what happened
to Mr. Renfield in Transylvania?

27
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,870
Nothing... Personal problems.

28
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:04,990
Close these transactions, and your
future with this firm is assured.

29
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:09,320
Yes, sir.
I will give it my full attention.

30
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,240
We've waited this long...

31
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:19,750
- We can be married when I return.
- Of course.

32
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:26,230
- I will write.
- Jonathan...

33
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:34,030
- Jonathan, I love you.
- I love you, Mina.

34
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,750
25th May, Budapest.
Left Budapest early this morning.

35
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,830
We're leaving the West...

36
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,990
We're traveling to the far east
of the country.

37
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:20,390
To the border of Transylvania,
Moldavia and Bukovina

38
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:26,270
in the Carpathian mountains.
One of the wildest areas of Europe.

39
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:34,080
My friend,
welcome to the Carpathians.

40
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,470
I am anxiously expecting you.

41
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:43,030
At the Borgo Pass,
my carriage will await you.

42
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,880
I trust your journey from London
has been a happy one.

43
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:53,790
And I hope you will enjoy your stay
in my beautiful land.

44
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,310
Your friend... D.

45
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:11,710
Diary, 25th May. My dear Jonathan
has been gone almost a week.

46
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,430
I wish we'd married
before his departure,

47
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:21,470
but I am happy he was sent
on this important mission.

48
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:25,560
It must be so nice
to see strange countries.

49
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:31,720
I wonder if Jonathan and I
shall ever see them together.

50
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:48,320
We're early, driver.
No one is here.

51
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,550
I say, is the castle far?

52
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,070
Welcome to my home.

53
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:30,190
Enter of your own will and leave
some of the happiness you bring.

54
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:35,990
- Count Dracula?
- I am Dracula.

55
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,880
And I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker,
to my house.

56
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,830
Come in.

57
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:06,230
You will, I trust, excuse me
that I do not join you.

58
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:14,670
I have already dined
and I never drink...

59
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,670
...wine.

60
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,400
An ancestor?
I see a resemblance.

61
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,880
The order of the Dracul...

62
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,790
...is a dragon.

63
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:41,790
An ancient society
pledging my forefathers

64
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:47,550
to defend the church
against all enemies of Christ.

65
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:54,950
That relationship
was not entirely... successful.

66
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,710
Oh, yes...

67
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:05,750
It is no laughing matter!

68
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:11,040
We Draculs have a right to be proud.

69
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:18,240
No devil was greater than Attila,
whose blood flows in these veins.

70
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,470
Blood...

71
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:33,430
...is too precious a thing
in these times.

72
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,190
The warlike days are over.

73
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:47,710
The victories of my great race
are but a tale to be told.

74
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:56,070
I am the last of my kind.

75
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:03,030
I have offended you
with my ignorance. Forgive me.

76
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:20,030
I long to go through the crowded
streets of your mighty London.

77
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:24,760
To be in the midst of the whirl
and the rush of humanity.

78
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:30,230
To share its life, its changes...
its death.

79
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,270
There. You, Count...

80
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,750
... are the owner of Carfax Abbey.
Congratulations.

81
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,070
Your firm writes most highly
of your talents.

82
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:51,000
They say
you are a man of good... taste.

83
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:59,440
And that you are a worthy substitute
to your predecessor, Mr. Renfield.

84
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:02,310
You may rely on me.

85
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,160
I'm curious. Why ten houses
in such precise locations?

86
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:11,670
Is it to raise the market value?

87
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:16,350
Do you believe in destiny?

88
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:22,600
That even the powers of time

89
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,070
can be altered
for a single purpose?

90
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:42,670
The luckiest man on earth
is the one who finds... true love.

91
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:47,750
You found Mina.
I thought she was lost.

92
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:54,390
We're to be married when I return.
Are you married, Count?

93
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,990
Sir, are you married?

94
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,480
I was married once.

95
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,880
Ages ago, it seems.
She died.

96
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:12,390
- I'm very sorry.
- She was fortunate.

97
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,270
My life, at its best, is misery.

98
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:27,030
She will, no doubt,
make a devoted wife...

99
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,830
...and you a faithful husband.

100
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:39,440
Come, write to your firm
and any loved ones.

101
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:45,870
Say that it should please you
to stay with me for a month.

102
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,040
A month?
Do you wish me to stay so long?

103
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:58,470
I will take no refusal.

104
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:12,310
Diary. 30th May, 1897.

105
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:16,430
Jonathan does not want me
to stay with Lucy while he is away.

106
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,150
If I become accustomed to the
privileges of the Weston family,

107
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,390
he thinks I will not be content
as the wife of a mere clerk.

108
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,190
But Lucy and I are friends.

109
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:33,310
She has never minded
that I am only a schoolmistress.

110
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,310
Disgusting!

111
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,750
Mina...

112
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:56,070
Mina, you're always working.

113
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,510
Is your ambitious John Harker
forcing you to learn that machine?

114
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:08,190
He could be forcing you into acts
of passion on the parlor floor.

115
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,040
Lucy! You shouldn't talk about
my fianc?in such a way.

116
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:16,470
There's more to marriage
than carnal pleasures.

117
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:22,200
So I see... much, much more!

118
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:33,510
What is it, Lucy?
I don't understand it.

119
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:38,150
Can man and woman
really do... that?

120
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,390
- I did... only last night.
- Fibber! You did not.

121
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:47,750
Yes, I did. Well, in my dreams.

122
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:53,360
Jonathan measures up, doesn't he?
You can tell Lucy.

123
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,920
We've kissed, that's all.

124
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,080
He thinks he's too poor
to marry me.

125
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:05,000
It's all the worse now that
I'm visiting you... my rich friend.

126
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:10,950
Yes, but not one marriage proposal,
and here I am almost 20...

127
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,240
Practically a hag!

128
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:21,590
Mr. Quincy P. Morris!

129
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,510
Look! What is that?

130
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:33,640
A Texan. Quincy P. Morris.
He's so young and fresh.

131
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,280
- A wild stallion between my legs.
- You're positively indecent!

132
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:42,480
I just know what men desire.
Watch.

133
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:45,800
- Quincy, darling.
- Miss Lucy...

134
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:49,150
You're as fresh as a spring rain.

135
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,990
Quincy, please let me touch it.

136
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:01,000
It's so big.

137
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:10,910
My dear, sweet little girl. I hold
your hand, and you've kissed me.

138
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:16,630
Jack! Oceans of love...

139
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:20,270
Oh, my poor little baby!

140
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:24,840
Come over here,
my poor little blossom.

141
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:29,830
My poor, little, brilliant doctor.

142
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:35,400
- What a naughty bear.
- Arthur Holmwood, Esquire.

143
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:38,390
My darling.

144
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,710
I'm so sorry about your hat.

145
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:47,030
This is my snake dress.

146
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:53,710
Lucy is a pure and virtuous girl,
but she does shock me sometimes.

147
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:59,190
Jonathan says a defect of the rich
is that they say what they please.

148
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:04,070
But I admire Lucy and I'm not
surprised men flock around her.

149
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:08,470
I wish I were as pretty
and as adored as she.

150
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:18,870
You are the love of my life.

151
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,200
What manner of man is this?

152
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,950
R.N. Renfield, successful solicitor
in the firm of Hawkins & Thompkins.

153
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,120
Member of the Wyndham Club.

154
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,600
He returns from business abroad
in Transylvania

155
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:46,320
and suffers a mental breakdown.
He's obsessed with some bloodlust.

156
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,630
George.

157
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:56,230
Wait here.

158
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:08,070
Would you care for an hors d'oeuvre,
doctor, or a canap?

159
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:15,160
- No, thank you. How are you?
- Better than my love-sick doctor.

160
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,950
- Does my private life interest you?
- Of course. All life interests me.

161
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:27,390
- Your diet is disgusting.
- They're perfectly nutritious.

162
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,390
Each life that I ingest
gives back life to me.

163
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,750
- A fly gives you life?
- Certainly.

164
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:47,200
You'll eat molecules with chopsticks
before I eat the lesser carnivore.

165
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:52,270
I shall have to invent a new
classification of lunatic for you.

166
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:55,990
What about spiders?
Spiders eat the flies.

167
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,870
- Yes, spiders eat them.
- What about sparrows?

168
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:07,910
- Yes... did you say sparrows?
- Something larger perhaps?

169
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:14,430
Oh yes...
A kitten. I beg you!

170
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:18,880
A little, sleek, playful kitten.
Something I can teach.

171
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,630
Something I can feed.
Don't refuse me.

172
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,110
Wouldn't you prefer a cat?

173
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:32,950
Yes! A big cat!
My salvation depends upon it.

174
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:37,600
- Your salvation?
- Yes, lives for the Master.

175
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,270
Master? What master?

176
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:44,840
The Master will come.

177
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:49,720
- He's promised to make me immortal.
- How?

178
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:57,310
The blood is the life!

179
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,830
Blood is the life!

180
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:08,000
30th May, Castle Dracula. I think
things that I dare not confess.

181
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:12,720
The way the Count looked at
Mina's picture fills me with fear.

182
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:17,840
As if I have a part to play
in a story that is not known to me.

183
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,710
I didn't hear you come in.

184
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:51,390
Take care. You cut yourself.
It is more dangerous than you think.

185
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:01,360
A foul bauble of man's... vanity.

186
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:05,840
Perhaps you should grow a beard.

187
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:19,350
The letters I requested...
have you written them?

188
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,590
Good.

189
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:48,790
Should you leave these rooms,

190
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:55,040
you will not go to sleep
in any other part of the castle.

191
00:26:55,790 --> 00:27:02,390
It is old and has many bad memories.

192
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:09,870
- Be warned.
- I'm sure I understand.

193
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:19,510
Do not put your faith in such...
trinkets of deceit.

194
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:28,430
We are in Transylvania,
and Transylvania is not England.

195
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:31,950
Our ways are not your ways.

196
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:37,360
And to you...
there shall be many strange things.

197
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:44,440
I've seen strange things already.
Wolves chasing me! A blue inferno!

198
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,030
Listen to them.

199
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:59,990
The children of the night.

200
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:07,430
- What sweet music they make.
- Music? Those animals?

201
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:42,630
I did as Dracula instructed.
I wrote three letters.

202
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:46,270
To the firm, to my family,
and to my beloved Mina.

203
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,950
I said nothing of my fears,
as he will read them, no doubt.

204
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:58,510
I know now that I am a prisoner.

205
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:21,230
Jonathan...

206
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:24,870
Jonathan, come to me.

207
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:35,800
Come.

208
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:57,270
Lay down.
Lay back into my arms.

209
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:10,440
Lay back, Jonathan.

210
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:59,080
What is this? Charlatans!

211
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:20,120
Dearest Mina, all is well here.

212
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:25,240
The Count has insisted
that I remain here for a month.

213
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:31,190
I can say no more, except I
love you. Ever faithful, Jonathan.

214
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:39,520
The letters I have written
have undoubtedly sealed my doom.

215
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:47,720
The Count's gypsies, loyal to the
death to whomever they serve.

216
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:57,360
Day and night, they fill boxes with
earth from the castle's cellar.

217
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:02,760
They are to be delivered
to Carfax Abbey in London.

218
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:08,430
Why do they fill these boxes
with earth?

219
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:16,800
I love him!

220
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,680
Mina, it's so wonderful.
I've decided.

221
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:26,190
- I love him and I've said yes!
- Finally.

222
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,600
- The Texan with the big knife?
- No, to my number three.

223
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:37,360
Lord Arthur Holmwood.
You're to be my maid of honor.

224
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:42,800
Mina, what is it? It's the most
exciting day of my life.

225
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:48,070
- You don't seem to care.
- I'm so worried about Jonathan.

226
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:54,440
This letter I received is so cold.
It's not like him at all.

227
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:58,680
Mina, don't worry.

228
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:27,430
Captain's log, the Demeter.
27th June, 1897.

229
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:34,320
We picked up 50 boxes of earth
bound for London, England.

230
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:39,200
We set sail at noon into a storm
that seemed to come from nowhere,

231
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:42,480
carrying us out to sea.

232
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,790
3rd July. Second mate is missing.
Nearing Gibraltar.

233
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,240
Storm continues.
Crew uneasy.

234
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:30,390
Believes someone or something
is aboard the ship with us.

235
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:47,710
He is here!
The master of all life is at hand!

236
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:52,070
Gather round! I am here
to do your bidding, Master!

237
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:58,030
I have worshipped you from afar,
but now you are near.

238
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:03,280
I am your slave.
I await your command.

239
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,150
The Renfield case
grows more interesting.

240
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:09,950
There is method in his madness,
with his flies and spiders.

241
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:16,600
Had I the secret
of even one such brilliant mind...

242
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,280
Lucy...

243
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:24,240
Lucy!

244
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:03,390
No, do not see me!

245
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:18,110
Lucy...

246
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:23,790
- I couldn't control myself.
- You're dreaming. Sleepwalking.

247
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:27,880
My soul...
It seemed to leave my body.

248
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:31,910
There was this agonizing feeling.

249
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:36,520
- I started shaking.
- It's all right, you're dreaming.

250
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:41,510
It pulled me and lured me.
I had no control.

251
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:49,550
Those red eyes. I still have
the taste of his blood in my mouth.

252
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:11,680
Master, I'm here to do your bidding.

253
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:18,920
Master, I am here.
I have worshipped you.

254
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:26,310
The vampire,
like any other night-creature,

255
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:32,550
can move about by day, but during
this time his powers are weak.

256
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,920
See the amazing cinematograph.

257
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:56,910
A wonder of modern civilization.
The latest sensation.

258
00:42:57,190 --> 00:43:03,440
The attraction of the century.
The new wonder of the world.

259
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:07,790
See the amazing cinematograph.

260
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,990
See me.

261
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:32,920
See me now.

262
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:42,790
Escaped wolf still at large!
Paper, sir?

263
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,150
Thank you, sir.

264
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:11,320
My humblest apologies.
Forgive my ignorance.

265
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,960
I am recently arrived from abroad,
and I do not know your city.

266
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:22,630
- As a beautiful lady...
- Purchase a street atlas. Good day.

267
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,110
I have offended you.

268
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,790
I'm looking for the cinematograph.
The wonder of the civilized world.

269
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:40,070
If you seek culture, visit a museum.
London is filled with them.

270
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:54,270
A woman so lovely and intelligent
should not be walking alone.

271
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:57,590
Do I know you, sir?

272
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:02,640
Are you acquainted with my husband?
Shall I call the police?

273
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:10,520
Husband?
I shall bother you no more.

274
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:15,000
Sir...

275
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:20,550
It is I who have been rude.
If you're looking...

276
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,630
Permit me to introduce myself.

277
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:31,110
I am Prince Vlad of Sachait.

278
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:39,750
- A prince, no less.
- I am your servant.

279
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:43,990
Wilhelmina Murray.

280
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:53,680
I am honored, Madam Mina.

281
00:45:57,070 --> 00:46:00,350
This way.

282
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:18,350
Mr. Holmwood asked me
to stop by to see Miss Lucy.

283
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:21,110
Dr. Seward, Miss Lucy.

284
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,960
Jack! Brilliant Jack!
Do you like it?

285
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:34,120
Did Arthur put you up to this?
Or did you want me alone?

286
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:41,440
Lucy, I'm here as your doctor.
Your fianc?is worried about you.

287
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:48,310
A doctor's confidence is sacred.
I must have your complete trust.

288
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:58,830
Help me, Jack. I don't know
what's happening to me.

289
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:03,830
I'm changing. I can feel it.

290
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:08,950
I can hear everything.
I can hear the servants whispering.

291
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:13,280
I hear mice in the attic
stomping like elephants.

292
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:19,560
But I'm having horrible nightmares.
The eyes...

293
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:24,590
- Jack...
- I'm here. Nothing will harm you.

294
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:33,270
- Let it work.
- Thank you...

295
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:36,710
Jack, kiss me.

296
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:45,560
Lucy is hotter than a June bride
riding bareback in the Sahara.

297
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,950
Watch your colonial tongue.

298
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:53,110
Hello, Jack.
How's our lovely patient today?

299
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:59,470
- Frankly, I'm confounded.
- Jack, are you still brooding?

300
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:06,110
- It must be something mental.
- How very droll. Did you hear that?

301
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:10,470
Last week he wanted to marry her,
now he wants to have her committed.

302
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:12,630
Let's have a look at her.

303
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:25,600
I'm at a loss, I admit.

304
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:30,350
I've cabled Abraham van Helsing,
the metaphysician-philosopher.

305
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:36,990
- He sounds like a witch doctor.
- He studies obscure diseases.

306
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:40,430
He's my teacher and mentor.

307
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:48,110
Do it, man.
Bring him here. Spare no expense.

308
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:26,480
Astounding.
There are no limits to science.

309
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,870
How can you call this science?

310
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:35,990
Do you think Madame Curie
would invite such comparisons?

311
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:44,310
I shouldn't have come here.
I must go.

312
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:51,800
Do not fear me.

313
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:09,520
Stop this!

314
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:22,640
My God, who are you?
I know you.

315
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:29,070
I have crossed oceans of time
to find you.

316
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,230
Come here, Mina.

317
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:55,550
He likes you.

318
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:22,590
There is much to be learned
from beasts.

319
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:38,680
A vampire bat must consume ten times
its own weight in blood each day,

320
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:43,430
or its own blood cells will die.

321
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,990
Cute little vermin.

322
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:58,150
Blood, and diseases of the blood
such as syphilis concern us here.

323
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:03,070
The very name venereal diseases,
the diseases of Venus,

324
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:08,120
imputes to them divine origin.
They involve the sex problem,

325
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:12,510
about which the ethics and ideals
of Christianity are concerned.

326
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:19,030
Civilization and syphilization
have advanced together.

327
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:24,520
- What is this?
- It's from the telegraph.

328
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:32,520
Thank you.
Gentlemen, that will be all.

329
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:46,350
Dawn. These may be the last words
I write in this journal.

330
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:50,910
Dracula has left me with these
women, these devils of the pit.

331
00:54:51,110 --> 00:54:55,990
They drain my blood to keep
me weak, so I cannot escape.

332
00:54:56,190 --> 00:55:02,270
I will try one last time today
to find a passageway to the river.

333
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:08,230
I must leave this cursed land
where the Devil's children walk.

334
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:22,870
I do attest that at this point,
l, Abraham van Helsing,

335
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:27,110
became personally involved
in these strange events.

336
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:23,190
Professor van Helsing.
How good of you to come.

337
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:31,710
I always come to a friend in need.
Tell me about your case.

338
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:37,800
She has the usual anemic signs.
Her blood is normal, yet it is not.

339
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:43,120
- She manifests repeated blood loss.
- Blood loss? How?

340
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:55,910
Close the doors!

341
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:09,710
My God, she is only a child.

342
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:14,320
My God!

343
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:19,030
She must have a transfusion at once.
Take off your jacket.

344
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:23,400
- You know how to tie a tourniquet.
- You perfected a procedure.

345
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:29,040
No, I only experimented.
Landsteiner's method.

346
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:31,600
Animals, goats, sheep...

347
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:36,870
If haemolysis occurs in the serum,
her red blood cells will explode,

348
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:40,280
and she will die.
Take this tube.

349
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:47,800
What in God's name is going on?
What are you doing to Lucy?

350
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,920
- Trying to save her life!
- Are you the fianc?

351
00:57:55,070 --> 00:58:00,270
Take off your coat. This young lady
needs blood and blood she must have.

352
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:05,470
- Take off your coat.
- Roll up your sleeve, Arthur.

353
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:08,950
- Quickly.
- Roll it up!

354
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:12,190
This may hurt a little.

355
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:26,440
Forgive me, sir. I would give
my last drop of blood to save her.

356
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:33,550
Your last drop? Thank you,
I don't ask as much as that... yet.

357
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:36,510
Hold her hand.

358
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:51,030
Jack, that poor girl has had
the blood of two men put into her.

359
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:55,710
Her whole body
couldn't hold that much blood.

360
00:58:57,350 --> 00:59:02,270
- What took it out?
- That's a good question.

361
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:12,430
Those marks on her throat...
No disease, no trituration.

362
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:15,560
The blood loss occurred there.

363
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:21,920
You were once a careful student.
Where did the blood go? Tell me.

364
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:29,470
- The bed clothes showed no blood.
- Believe what your senses tell you.

365
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:34,870
Something went up there
sucked it out of her and flew away?

366
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:40,750
- Yeah, why not?
- Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant!

367
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:46,480
Will one of you learned doctors
kindly tell me what is going on?

368
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:49,350
Jack, you are a scientist.

369
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:54,070
Do you not think there are things
you cannot understand?

370
00:59:54,270 --> 01:00:00,430
Mesmerism, hypnotism,
materialization...

371
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:12,350
- Professor?
- Where the hell did he go?

372
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:19,670
- You see?
- I feel like a blundering novice.

373
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:23,310
We're not fighting
some disease here.

374
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:27,480
There is something
unspeakable out there.

375
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:31,920
Dead but not dead.
It stalks us with some purpose.

376
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:37,470
To live, it feeds on Lucy's blood.
It is a beast. A monster.

377
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:58,430
What is happening
to Lucy and to me?

378
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:03,590
My feelings are so troubled.
I wish I were myself again.

379
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:07,550
The sensible Mina
I always depended on.

380
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:19,160
Absinthe...
is the aphrodisiac of the self.
