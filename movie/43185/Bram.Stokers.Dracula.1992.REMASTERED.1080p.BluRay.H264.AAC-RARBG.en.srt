1
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:41,082
The year, 1462.

2
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,460
Constantinople had fallen.

3
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:48,423
Moslem Turks swept into Europe
with a vast, superior force...

4
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,634
striking at Romania,
threatening all of Christendom.

5
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:55,262
From Transylvania
arose a Romanian knight...

6
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,683
of the Sacred Order of the Dragon,
known as Dracula.

7
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:18,076
On the eve of the battle...

8
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,954
his bride, Elisabeta...

9
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:24,250
whom he prized
above all things on Earth...

10
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:28,504
knew that he must face
an insurmountable force...

11
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:32,341
from which he might never return.

12
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:33,985
God be praised.
I am victorious.

13
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,706
Elisabeta.

14
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:52,379
The vengeful Turks
shot an arrow into the castle...

15
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:55,758
carrying false news
of Dracula's death.

16
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,593
Elisabeta, believing him dead...

17
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,681
flung herself into the river.

18
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,847
My prince is dead.

19
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,098
All is lost without him.

20
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:48,019
May God unite us in heaven.

21
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,618
She has taken her own life.

22
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,580
Her soul cannot be saved.

23
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,831
She is damned.

24
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,793
It is God's law.

25
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:25,389
Is this my reward
for defending God's church?

26
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:26,557
Sacrilege!

27
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:30,353
I renounce God!

28
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:34,856
I shall rise from my own death...

29
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:39,612
to avenge hers
with all the powers of darkness.

30
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:00,423
The blood is the life...

31
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,387
and it shall be mine!

32
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,404
I've done everything
that you asked, master.

33
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:09,535
All the preparations
are in order.

34
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,327
Everything.

35
00:06:11,495 --> 00:06:14,206
I await your command.

36
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,959
For I know...

37
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:20,295
that when the rewards
are given...

38
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:24,091
I will be one of those
who benefits from your generosity.

39
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,264
Thank you.

40
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,728
Gone mad.
Renfield is deranged.

41
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:39,731
He's lost his greedy mind,
poor chap.

42
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,317
I want you to take over
for his foreign client...

43
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,528
this rather eccentric
Count Dracula.

44
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:47,865
- He's buying up property in London.
- Of course, sir.

45
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,826
I'll attend to the count.
Thank you for your confidence.

46
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,995
This is a great opportunity
for you, Harker.

47
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:57,290
But you'll have to leave
for Transylvania immediately.

48
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:01,002
Opportunities such as this
come but once in a lifetime.

49
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,505
Yes, of course, sir.

50
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,173
If I may inquire...

51
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,093
what, in fact, happened
to Mr. Renfield in Transylvania?

52
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,262
Nothing. Nothing.

53
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,307
Personal problems.

54
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,309
Close these transactions...

55
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,603
and your future with this firm
is assured.

56
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,689
Yes, sir.
I will give it my full attention.

57
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:28,322
We've waited this long,
haven't we?

58
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,699
We can be married when I return.

59
00:07:32,701 --> 00:07:34,036
Of course.

60
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,579
I'll write.

61
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:39,332
Jonathan.

62
00:07:44,004 --> 00:07:45,880
Jonathan, I love you.

63
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,925
I love you, Mina.

64
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,749
25th May, Budapest.

65
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,252
Left Budapest early this morning.

66
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,129
The impression I had
was that we were leaving the west...

67
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,716
and entering the east.

68
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:32,760
The district I am to enter
is in the extreme east of the country...

69
00:08:32,928 --> 00:08:34,596
just on the borders
of three states...

70
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,349
Transylvania, Moldavia
and Bukovina...

71
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,601
in the midst
of the Carpathian Mountains...

72
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:43,188
one of the wildest
and least known portions of Europe.

73
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,402
"My friend...

74
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,779
welcome to the Carpathians.

75
00:08:51,947 --> 00:08:55,116
I am anxiously expecting you.

76
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,244
At the Borgo Pass...

77
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:01,039
my carriage will await you
and bring you to me.

78
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:06,003
I trust your journey from London
has been a happy one...

79
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,964
and that you
will enjoy your stay...

80
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,217
in my beautiful land.

81
00:09:12,384 --> 00:09:16,263
Your friend, D."

82
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,316
Diary, 25th May.

83
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:30,818
My Jonathan has been gone
almost a week.

84
00:09:30,986 --> 00:09:34,782
And although I was disappointed we
could not marry before his departure...

85
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,159
I am happy that he got sent
on this important assignment.

86
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,163
I am longing to hear
all the news.

87
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:45,167
It must be so nice
to see strange countries.

88
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:48,461
I wonder if we—
I mean Jonathan and I...

89
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,713
shall ever see them together.

90
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,356
We're early, driver.
No one is here.

91
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,652
For the dead travel fast.

92
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,937
I say, is the castle far?

93
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,519
Welcome to my home.

94
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,730
Enter freely of your own will...

95
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,817
and leave some of
the happiness you bring.

96
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,778
Count Dracula?

97
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,822
I am...

98
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,948
Dracula.

99
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,870
And I bid you welcome,
Mr. Harker, to my house.

100
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,374
Come in.

101
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:32,019
You will, I trust,
excuse me that I...

102
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:34,395
do not join you.

103
00:13:37,232 --> 00:13:39,942
But I have already dined.

104
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,739
And I never drink...

105
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,326
wine.

106
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,585
An ancestor?
I see a resemblance.

107
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,590
The Order of the Dracul.

108
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,177
The Dragon.

109
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,721
An ancient society...

110
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,475
pledging my forefathers...

111
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:16,772
to defend their church
against all enemies of Christ.

112
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:23,820
That relationship
was not entirely...

113
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,280
successful.

114
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,201
Oh, yes.

115
00:14:33,121 --> 00:14:36,124
It is no laughing matter.

116
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:42,880
We Draculs
have a right to be proud.

117
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,967
What devil or witch
was ever so great as Attila...

118
00:14:46,134 --> 00:14:49,471
whose blood flows
in these veins?

119
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:55,894
Blood...

120
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:04,820
is too precious a thing
in these times.

121
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:13,495
The warlike days are over.

122
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:18,667
The victories of my great race...

123
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,586
are but a tale to be told.

124
00:15:24,631 --> 00:15:28,677
I am the last of my kind.

125
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:34,390
I have offended you
with my ignorance, Count.

126
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,976
Forgive me.

127
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,618
I do so long to go
through the crowded streets...

128
00:15:52,784 --> 00:15:55,037
of your mighty London...

129
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:59,875
to be in the midst of the whirl
and the rush of humanity...

130
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:02,376
to share its life...

131
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,547
its changes, its death.

132
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:09,134
There. You, Count, are—

133
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:14,221
Are the owner of
Carfax Abbey at Purfleet.

134
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:16,557
Congratulations.

135
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,477
Your firm writes most highly...

136
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,979
of your talents.

137
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:24,941
They say you are a man of good...

138
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,610
taste.

139
00:16:28,528 --> 00:16:31,072
And that you are
a worthy substitute...

140
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,036
to your predecessor, Mr. Renfield.

141
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,830
You may rely on me, Count.

142
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,707
Forgive my curiosity,
but why ten houses...

143
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,086
in such precise locations
around London?

144
00:16:44,711 --> 00:16:47,338
Is it to raise the market value?

145
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,594
Do you believe in destiny?

146
00:16:55,472 --> 00:17:00,101
That even the powers of time...

147
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,522
can be altered
for a single purpose?

148
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,282
The luckiest man
who walks on this Earth...

149
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,619
is the one who finds...

150
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:21,038
true love.

151
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,916
You found Mina.

152
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,420
I thought she was lost.

153
00:17:26,586 --> 00:17:29,756
We're to be married
as soon as I return.

154
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,967
Are you married, Count?

155
00:17:33,301 --> 00:17:34,427
Sir...

156
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,471
are you married?

157
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,726
I was married once.

158
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,144
Ages ago, it seems.

159
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,314
She died.

160
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,109
I'm very sorry.

161
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:52,153
She was fortunate.

162
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:58,326
My life, at its best, is misery.

163
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,875
She will no doubt
make a devoted wife.

164
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,837
And you a faithful husband.

165
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,884
Come.

166
00:18:15,051 --> 00:18:18,680
Write now, my friend,
to your firm...

167
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:22,726
and to any loved ones,
and say that it shall please you...

168
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:24,935
to stay with me...

169
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,105
until a month from now.

170
00:18:28,523 --> 00:18:30,232
A month?

171
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,528
Do you wish me to stay so long?

172
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:40,201
I will take no refusal.

173
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:55,049
Diary, 30th of May, 1897.

174
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:59,805
I know Jonathan does not want me to
stay here with Lucy while he is away.

175
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:04,226
He thinks that if I become accustomed
to the wealth of the Westenra family...

176
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:08,230
I will not be content as the wife
of a mere clerk in a law firm.

177
00:19:08,396 --> 00:19:11,106
But Lucy and I have been friends
since we were children...

178
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,443
and she has never minded
that I am only a schoolmistress.

179
00:19:23,703 --> 00:19:25,913
How disgustingly awful.

180
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,167
Mina!

181
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,926
Oh, Mina, you're always working.

182
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,263
Is your ambitious Jon Harker...

183
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,099
forcing you to learn
that ridiculous machine?

184
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,435
When he could be forcing you
to perform...

185
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:52,773
unspeakable acts of desperate
passion on the parlor floor.

186
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,442
Lucy, really.

187
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:57,444
You shouldn't talk about
my fiancé in such a way.

188
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,030
There's more to marriage
than carnal pleasure.

189
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:05,119
Oh, Mina. So I see.

190
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:07,705
Much, much more.

191
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,792
That's—

192
00:20:14,337 --> 00:20:16,631
What is it, Lucy?

193
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,300
Because I don't understand it.

194
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,178
Can a man and woman really do...

195
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,138
that?

196
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:26,807
I did, only last night.

197
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:29,728
- Fibber. You did not.
- Yes, I did.

198
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,981
Well, in my dreams.

199
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,984
Jonathan measures up,
doesn't he?

200
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,028
You can tell Lucy.

201
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,615
We've kissed. That's all.

202
00:20:42,782 --> 00:20:45,492
He thinks he's too poor
to marry me.

203
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:50,332
And it's all the worse now that
I'm here visiting you at Hillingham...

204
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,125
my rich friend.

205
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:55,753
Yes, but not even
one marriage proposal.

206
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,213
And here I am, almost 20...

207
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,674
practically a hag.

208
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,351
Mr. Quincey P. Morris.

209
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:14,439
- Oh, look.
- What is that?

210
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,816
A Texan.

211
00:21:16,983 --> 00:21:19,027
Quincey P. Morris.

212
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,946
He's so young and fresh...

213
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,324
like a wild stallion
between my legs.

214
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,451
You're positively indecent.

215
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,078
I just know what men desire.

216
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,872
Watch.

217
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,625
- Quincey, darling.
- Miss Lucy.

218
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,627
Why, you're as fresh
as the spring rain.

219
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,712
Oh, thank you.

220
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:45,220
Please let me touch it.

221
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:49,265
It's so big.

222
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,811
Little girl.

223
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,147
Oh, my dear,
sweet little girl.

224
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,401
I hold your hand...

225
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:01,819
- ... and you've kissed me.
- Jack!

226
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:06,700
Oceans of love—
Oh, Jack, my darling.

227
00:22:06,866 --> 00:22:08,492
Poor little baby.

228
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,537
My kitten, come over here.

229
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,872
Come over here
and I'll kiss it better.

230
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,250
My poor little blossom.

231
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,502
My poor little doctor.
Brilliant doctor.

232
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,505
- Hello, Quincey.
- Jack.

233
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,923
What a naughty bear.
Let me—

234
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:26,260
- Arthur Holmwood, Esquire.
- Arthur!

235
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,388
Oh, my darling.

236
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,974
Oh, you look wonderful.

237
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:34,935
I'm so sorry about your hat.

238
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:36,938
- Charming.
- It's my snake dress.

239
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,397
Is it really?

240
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:41,276
Lucy is a pure
and virtuous girl...

241
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:45,447
but I admit that her free way
of speaking shocks me sometimes.

242
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,615
Jonathan says it is a defect
of the aristocracy...

243
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,993
that they say what they please.

244
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:56,290
The truth is that I admire Lucy. I'm not
surprised that men flock around her.

245
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:59,335
I wish I were as pretty
and as adored as she.

246
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:20,147
What manner of man is this?

247
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:22,776
R.M. Renfield,
successful solicitor...

248
00:23:22,942 --> 00:23:25,612
in the firm of Hawkins
and Thompkins...

249
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,740
respected member of
the Lord Nugent's Windem Club...

250
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:33,286
returns from business abroad
in Transylvania...

251
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:36,413
promptly suffers
a complete mental breakdown.

252
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:39,834
He's now obsessed
with some blood lust.

253
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:45,507
George.

254
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,802
Wait here.

255
00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:00,063
Would you care for
an hors d'oeuvre, Dr. Seward...

256
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,898
or a canapé?

257
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:06,611
No, thank you, Mr. Renfield.
How are you feeling tonight?

258
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,365
Far better than you,
my lovesick doctor.

259
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,366
Is my personal life
of interest to you?

260
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:16,412
Of course it is.
All life interests me.

261
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:19,457
Your diet, Mr. Renfield,
is disgusting.

262
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:23,044
Actually,
they're perfectly nutritious.

263
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:26,005
You see,
each life that I ingest...

264
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,383
gives back life to me.

265
00:24:32,011 --> 00:24:34,847
A fly gives you life?

266
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,723
Certainly.

267
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:40,894
But you might as well ask a man to eat
molecules with a pair of chopsticks...

268
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:43,815
than to interest me
in a lesser carnivore.

269
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:47,527
I shall have to invent a new
classification of lunatic for you.

270
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:52,906
What about spiders?
Spiders eat the flies.

271
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:56,577
Yes, spiders eat them.

272
00:24:56,744 --> 00:24:59,079
What about sparrows?

273
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:02,584
Oh, yes.
Did you say sparrows?

274
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:06,921
- Something larger, perhaps?
- Oh, yes.

275
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:10,383
A kitten.

276
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,093
I beg you.

277
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,221
A little, sleek— A playful kitten.

278
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:18,682
Something I can teach.
Something I can feed.

279
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,684
No one would refuse me a kitten.

280
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,145
Wouldn't you prefer a cat?

281
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:26,941
Oh, yes.

282
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:29,152
A big cat.

283
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,279
- My salvation depends upon it!
- Your salvation?

284
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,449
Yes. I need lives.

285
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,826
- I need lives for the master.
- What master?

286
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,957
The master will come...

287
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:47,127
and he has promised
to make me immortal.

288
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:48,837
How?

289
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:52,133
Get him off!

290
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:55,845
The blood is the life!

291
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:59,015
The blood is the life!

292
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:03,435
30th May, Castle Dracula.

293
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:07,898
I think strange things which
I dare not confess to my own soul.

294
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,400
The count...

295
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:12,987
the way he looked at Mina's picture
fills me with dread...

296
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:16,031
as if I have a part to play
in a story that is not known to me.

297
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,267
I didn't hear you come in.

298
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,815
Take care how you cut yourself.

299
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:52,359
It is more dangerous
than you think.

300
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:03,704
A foul bauble of man's vanity.

301
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,207
Perhaps you should...

302
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,542
grow a beard.

303
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,885
The letters I requested.

304
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,263
Have you written them?

305
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:39,324
Good.

306
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:51,836
Should you leave these rooms...

307
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,423
you will not, by any chance...

308
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,884
go to sleep in any other
part of the castle.

309
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,805
It is old...

310
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,933
and has many bad memories.

311
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:12,606
- Be warned.
- I'm sure I understand.

312
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:25,202
Do not put your faith
in such trinkets of deceit.

313
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,664
We are in Transylvania.

314
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:34,711
Transylvania is not England.

315
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,048
Our ways are not your ways.

316
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,218
And to you...

317
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,637
there shall be
many strange things.

318
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:47,057
I've seen many
strange things already.

319
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:50,435
Bloody wolves chasing me
through some blue inferno!

320
00:28:55,858 --> 00:28:58,653
Listen to them.

321
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:06,035
The children of the night.

322
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:10,330
What sweet music they make.

323
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:13,542
Music? Those animals?

324
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:51,913
I did as Dracula instructed.
I wrote three letters.

325
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:55,542
To the firm, to my family
and to my beloved Mina.

326
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:58,628
I said nothing of my fears
as he will read them, no doubt.

327
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,471
I know now that I am a prisoner.

328
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:33,641
Jonathan.

329
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,185
Jonathan, come to me.

330
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:48,655
Come.

331
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:08,884
Lay down.

332
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,221
Lay back into my arms.

333
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:24,232
Lay back, Jonathan.

334
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:29,150
How dare you touch him!
He belongs to me!

335
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:31,652
You yourself never loved.

336
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:39,492
Yes. I too can love.

337
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:45,708
And I shall love again.

338
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,927
Are we to have nothing tonight?

339
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,724
"Dearest Mina,
all is well here.

340
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:46,726
The count has insisted
I remain for a month...

341
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:49,103
to tutor him in English custom.

342
00:35:49,271 --> 00:35:52,650
I can say no more,
except I love you.

343
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:55,568
Ever faithful, Jonathan."

344
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:02,576
The letters I have written
have undoubtedly sealed my doom.

345
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:10,251
The count's gypsies, fearless warriors
who are loyal to the death...

346
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,628
to whatever nobleman they serve...

347
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:19,092
day and night they toil,
filling boxes with decrepit earth...

348
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,512
from the bowels of the castle.

349
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:28,143
They are to be delivered to his newly
acquired Carfax Abbey in London.

350
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:34,108
Why do they
fill these boxes with earth?

351
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,865
I love him! I love him!

352
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,913
It's so wonderful.
I've decided.

353
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:50,541
I love him
and I've said yes.

354
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:54,128
Finally. Don't tell me.
The Texan with the big knife?

355
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:57,130
Oh, no.
To my dear number three.

356
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:01,260
Lord Arthur Holmwood.
Lord and Lady Holmwood.

357
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:04,137
You are to be my maid of honor.
Oh, say yes.

358
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:08,559
Mina, what is it?
It's the most exciting day of my life.

359
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,146
You don't seem to care.

360
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:15,398
It's just that I'm
so terribly worried about Jonathan.

361
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,735
This letter I received is so—

362
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:21,322
It's so cold. It's so unnatural.
It's not like him at all.

363
00:37:22,364 --> 00:37:24,365
Mina, don't worry.

364
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:53,019
Captain's log: the Demeter.

365
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:54,521
27th June, 1897.

366
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,362
We picked up 50 boxes
of experimental earth...

367
00:38:01,528 --> 00:38:03,780
bound for London, England.

368
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:06,115
Set sail at noon into a storm...

369
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,786
that seemed
to come out of nowhere...

370
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:11,371
carrying us out to sea.

371
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:50,077
Third of July.
Second mate has gone missing.

372
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:54,664
Nearing Gibraltar.
Storm continues. Crew uneasy.

373
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,418
Believe someone or something...

374
00:38:58,585 --> 00:39:01,213
is aboard the ship with us.

375
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,144
Master, I am here!

376
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:20,106
The master of all life is at hand!

377
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,192
Gather round!

378
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,777
I am here to do
your bidding, master!

379
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:27,280
I have worshiped you
long and far off!

380
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:30,909
And now you are near, master!

381
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,661
I am your slave!

382
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,456
I await your command!

383
00:39:36,623 --> 00:39:39,333
The case of Renfield
grows more interesting.

384
00:39:39,501 --> 00:39:43,297
Yet, there is method in his madness
with his flies and spiders.

385
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:46,632
Had I the secret of even
one such brilliant mind...

386
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,637
the key to the fancy
of one lunatic...

387
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,019
Lucy.

388
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:58,914
Lucy? Lucy!

389
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:42,976
No. Do not see me.

390
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:01,577
Oh! I couldn't control myself.

391
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:05,539
Hush, Lucy. You're dreaming.
You're walking in your sleep again.

392
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:09,710
My soul,
it seemed to leave my body.

393
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:14,548
There was this agonizing feeling,
and I couldn't get back to it.

394
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,134
I'm absolutely shaking.

395
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,177
It's all right.
You were dreaming.

396
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:21,556
I had to. It sort of
pulled me and lured me.

397
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:24,851
- I had no control.
- It's all right.

398
00:43:25,018 --> 00:43:27,938
- It had red eyes.
- Hush now.

399
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:31,148
I still have the taste
of his blood in my mouth.

400
00:43:44,746 --> 00:43:47,541
Here we go.
Swing it round here.

401
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:51,003
Master.

402
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,922
I am here to do your bidding.

403
00:43:56,009 --> 00:43:59,260
Master! I am here!

404
00:44:00,762 --> 00:44:03,056
I have worshiped you.

405
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:08,769
Contrary to some beliefs,
the vampire...

406
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:12,898
like any other night creature,
can move about by day...

407
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:17,403
though it is not his natural time,
and his powers are weak.

408
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:37,132
See the amazing cinematograph!

409
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,260
A wonder of modern civilization!

410
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,637
The latest sensation!

411
00:44:42,804 --> 00:44:45,849
The greatest attraction
of the century!

412
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,768
The new wonder of the world!

413
00:45:13,126 --> 00:45:15,045
See me.

414
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,130
See me now.

415
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:28,099
Escaped wolf from zoo
still at large!

416
00:45:28,266 --> 00:45:30,143
Buy a paper, sir?

417
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,980
Thank you, sir.

418
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:39,985
Get your Gazette!
Penny a paper!

419
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:55,751
My humblest apologies.

420
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:59,840
Forgive my ignorance.

421
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:03,009
I am recently arrived
from abroad...

422
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:06,179
and I do not know your city.

423
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:10,266
- Is a beautiful lady—
- A street atlas is sixpence. Good day.

424
00:46:13,186 --> 00:46:15,105
I have offended you.

425
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:18,900
I am only looking for
the cinematograph.

426
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:22,528
I understand it is a wonder
of the civilized world.

427
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:26,407
If you seek culture,
then visit a museum.

428
00:46:26,576 --> 00:46:29,494
London is filled with them.
Excuse me.

429
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:41,465
A woman so lovely and intelligent...

430
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:45,177
should not be walking the streets
of London without her gentleman.

431
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,554
Do I know you, sir?

432
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:51,682
Are you acquainted
with my husband?

433
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:53,726
Shall I call the police?

434
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:57,731
Husband?

435
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,317
I shall bother you no more.

436
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:05,655
Sir.

437
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:09,409
It is I who have been rude.

438
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:12,411
- If you're looking—
- Please.

439
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:17,333
Permit me to introduce myself.

440
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:23,422
I am Prince Vlad of Sagite.

441
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:28,427
- A prince, no less?
- I am...

442
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:31,972
your servant.

443
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,853
Wilhelmina Murray.

444
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,442
I am...

445
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,610
honored...

446
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:46,695
Madam Mina.

447
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,452
This way.

448
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:07,550
Hello, sir.

449
00:48:07,717 --> 00:48:10,971
Mr. Holmwood asked me
to stop by to see Miss Lucy.

450
00:48:11,137 --> 00:48:12,597
Yes, sir.

451
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:15,432
- Dr. Seward, Miss Lucy.
- Thank you.

452
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,143
Oh, Jack!

453
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:20,563
Brilliant Jack.
Do you like it?

454
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:24,317
Did Arthur put you up to this...

455
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:27,862
or did you want me alone just once
before I'm married?

456
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:31,449
Lucy, you're embarrassing me.

457
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:34,327
I'm here as your doctor.

458
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:36,663
Your fiancé
is very worried about you...

459
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:41,626
and I assure you,
a doctor's confidence is sacred.

460
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:43,878
I must have your complete trust.

461
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,510
Help me, Jack.

462
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,597
I don't know
what's happening to me.

463
00:48:54,764 --> 00:48:56,849
I'm changing.

464
00:48:57,018 --> 00:48:58,893
I can feel it.

465
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:02,313
I can hear everything.

466
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:05,483
I hear the servants at the other
end of the house, whispering.

467
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:08,902
I hear mice in the attic,
stomping like elephants.

468
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,740
But I'm having horrible
nightmares, Jack.

469
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:16,369
The eyes.

470
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:17,871
Oh, Jack.

471
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:21,708
I'm here, Lucy.
Nothing will harm you.

472
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:26,128
Let it work.

473
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:30,382
- Thank you.
- Lucy.

474
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,927
Oh, Jack, kiss me.

475
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:40,893
And may I say, Miss Lucy
is hotter than a June bride...

476
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:43,396
riding bareback
buck naked in the Sahara.

477
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:46,231
I would watch my colonial tongue
if I were you.

478
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:51,320
Hello, Jack.
And how's our lovely patient today?

479
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:55,199
Well, frankly, Arthur,
I'm confounded.

480
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,994
Jack, are you still
brooding over Miss Lucy?

481
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:01,664
I can only conclude
it must be something mental.

482
00:50:01,831 --> 00:50:05,251
How very droll.
Did you hear that, Quince?

483
00:50:05,418 --> 00:50:08,963
Last week he wanted to marry her, and
now he wants to have her committed.

484
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:11,800
Let's have a look at her.

485
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:25,563
I'm at a loss, I admit.

486
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:28,315
I've taken the liberty
of cabling Abraham Van Helsing...

487
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:30,443
the metaphysician, philosopher.

488
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:33,405
Sounds like a goddamn
witch doctor to me, Jack.

489
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:37,367
Van Helsing knows more about obscure
diseases than any man in the world.

490
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,702
He's my teacher and mentor.

491
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:46,126
Do it, man.
Bring him here.

492
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,253
Spare no expense.

493
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,706
Astounding.

494
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:27,666
There are no limits to science.

495
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,172
How can you call this science?

496
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:36,509
Do you think Madam Curie
would invite such comparisons?

497
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:38,344
Really.

498
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:44,726
I shouldn't have come here.

499
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:46,811
I must go.

500
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,027
Do not fear me.

501
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:10,793
Stop this.

502
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,545
Stop this.

503
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:25,474
My God. Who are you?

504
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:27,309
I know you.

505
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:32,023
I have crossed oceans of time...

506
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,067
to find you.

507
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:15,190
There is no need to panic.

508
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:19,027
The animal handlers have
everything under complete control.

509
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:41,134
Come here, Mina.

510
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:01,987
He likes you.

511
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:31,476
There is much to be learned
from beasts.

512
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:46,800
The tropical pampas vampire bat
must...

513
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:50,762
consume ten times its own weight
in fresh blood each day...

514
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:54,391
or its own blood cells will die.

515
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:05,445
Cute little vermin, ja?

516
00:56:06,612 --> 00:56:09,157
Blood and the diseases
of the blood...

517
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:12,117
such as syphilis,
they concern us here.

518
00:56:13,202 --> 00:56:15,454
The very name
"venereal diseases"...

519
00:56:15,621 --> 00:56:19,291
the diseases of Venus,
imputes to them divine origin.

520
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:22,836
And they are involved
in that sex problem about which...

521
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:27,050
the ethics and ideals
of Christian civilization are concerned.

522
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:32,304
In fact, civilization and syphilization
have advanced together.

523
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:38,101
- What is this?
- It's from the telegraph, Professor.

524
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:40,146
Telegraph?

525
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:46,485
Thank you. Gentlemen, thank you.
That will be all.

526
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,498
Dawn.

527
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:02,501
These may be the last words
I write in this journal.

528
00:57:02,668 --> 00:57:05,295
Dracula has left me
with these women...

529
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:07,507
these devils of the pit.

530
00:57:07,673 --> 00:57:09,842
They drain my blood
to keep me weak...

531
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:12,677
barely alive so I cannot escape.

532
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:16,181
I will try one last time today
to escape to the water.

533
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:19,184
There must be passageway
to the river...

534
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:21,771
and then away
from this cursed land...

535
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:25,108
where the devil and his children
still walk with earthly feet.

536
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:37,494
For the record, I do attest...

537
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:40,873
that at this point,
I, Abraham Van Helsing...

538
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:44,918
became personally involved
in these strange events.

539
00:58:38,931 --> 00:58:41,934
Professor Van Helsing,
how good of you to come.

540
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:49,900
I always come to my friends in need
when they call me.

541
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,445
So, Jack, tell me everything
about your case.

542
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:55,489
She has all the usual
physical anemic signs.

543
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:58,784
Her blood analyzes normal,
and yet it is not.

544
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:02,496
She manifests continued blood loss.
I cannot trace the cause.

545
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:04,581
Blood loss? How?

546
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,259
My God, close the doors!

547
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:27,938
My God...

548
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:30,190
she's only a child.

549
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:33,277
Ja.

550
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:36,530
My God.

551
00:59:36,697 --> 00:59:40,701
There's no time to lose.
There must be a transfusion at once.

552
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:43,496
Take off your coat.
Remember how to tie a tourniquet?

553
00:59:43,664 --> 00:59:45,998
- Or have you forgotten?
- You perfected a procedure?

554
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:48,583
Perfected? No.
I've only experimented.

555
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,670
Landsteiner's method.

556
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:54,673
Animals, goats, sheeps.

557
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:58,219
If hemolysis occurs
in the blood donor serum...

558
00:59:58,387 --> 01:00:00,054
her red blood cells will explode.

559
01:00:00,222 --> 01:00:02,556
She will die.
Take this tube.

560
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:08,646
What in God's name
is going on up here?

561
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:10,648
This is Professor Van Helsing, Art.

562
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:13,192
- What the hell is he doing to Lucy?
- He's trying to save her life.

563
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,902
- Good God!
- You're the fiancé? Please.

564
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:22,409
Take off your coat.
This young lady's very ill. She's dying.

565
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:24,577
She wants blood
and blood she must have.

566
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:26,079
Take off your coat.

567
01:00:26,248 --> 01:00:28,164
Roll up your sleeve, Art.

568
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:31,835
- Oh, God.
- Quickly, quickly.

569
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:33,545
Roll it up!

570
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:35,463
This may hurt a little, Art.

571
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:50,730
Forgive me. My life is hers. I would
give my last drop of blood to save her.

572
01:00:50,896 --> 01:00:52,773
Your last drop?

573
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,567
Thank you.

574
01:00:54,735 --> 01:00:59,070
You are very welcome here.
I don't ask as much as that. Not yet.

575
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:00,655
Hold her hand.

576
01:01:13,253 --> 01:01:17,590
Jack, that poor creature has had the
blood of two men put into her already.

577
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:21,177
Man alive. Her whole body
couldn't hold that much blood.

578
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:27,599
- What took it out?
- That's a good question, Mr. Morris.

579
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:35,106
Those marks on her throat...

580
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:37,650
no disease, no trituration...

581
01:01:37,818 --> 01:01:39,652
I am sure the blood loss
occurred there.

582
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:41,739
Oh? Where did the blood go?

583
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:45,576
You were once
a careful student, Jack.

584
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:47,577
Use your brain!
Where did the blood go?

585
01:01:47,746 --> 01:01:49,121
Tell me!

586
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:52,458
- The bed would be covered in blood.
- Exactly.

587
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:55,043
You do not let your eyes see
nor your ears hear...

588
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,463
that which you cannot account for.

589
01:01:57,630 --> 01:02:01,634
Something just went up there,
sucked it out of her and flew away?

590
01:02:03,177 --> 01:02:04,969
Ja. Why not?

591
01:02:05,137 --> 01:02:09,349
That's brilliant.
That's absolutely brilliant.

592
01:02:09,518 --> 01:02:11,643
Will one of you learned doctors,
or whatever you are...

593
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,771
kindly tell me
what is going on with my Lucy?

594
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:17,733
Jack, you are a scientist.

595
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:21,237
Do you not think there are things in
this universe you cannot understand...

596
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:23,864
and which are true.
Mesmerism, hypnotism?

597
01:02:24,032 --> 01:02:26,117
You and Charcot
have proved hypnotism.

598
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:27,701
Materialization, astral bodies.

599
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:39,422
Professor?

600
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,257
Where did he go?

601
01:02:45,429 --> 01:02:47,304
You see?

602
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:49,849
I feel like a blundering novice.

603
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:53,518
Gentlemen, we're not fighting
some disease here.

604
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:55,688
Those marks on your dear
Miss Lucy's neck were made...

605
01:02:55,856 --> 01:02:58,023
by something unspeakable
out there.

606
01:02:58,190 --> 01:02:59,358
Dead, but not dead.

607
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:02,570
It stalks us for some dread purpose
I do not comprehend.

608
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:05,822
To live, it feeds
on Lucy's precious blood.

609
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:08,409
It is a beast, a monster.

610
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:30,181
What is happening
to Lucy and to me?

611
01:03:30,347 --> 01:03:33,516
When I was younger,
my feelings were never troubled.

612
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:35,978
I wish I were myself again...

613
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:39,856
the sensible Mina
I always depended on.

614
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:48,364
Absinthe...

615
01:03:48,532 --> 01:03:50,992
is the aphrodisiac of the self.

616
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:55,414
The green fairy...

617
01:03:55,581 --> 01:04:00,293
who lives in the absinthe...

618
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:02,378
wants your soul.

619
01:04:05,257 --> 01:04:06,592
But...

620
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:10,929
you are safe with me.

621
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:27,947
Tell me, Prince...

622
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:30,199
tell me of your home.

623
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:34,994
The most beautiful place...

624
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:37,081
in all creation.

625
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:41,793
Yes, it must be.

626
01:04:45,422 --> 01:04:49,635
A land beyond
a great, vast forest...

627
01:04:52,304 --> 01:04:54,974
surrounded by
majestic mountains...

628
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:58,726
lush vineyards...

629
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:05,275
and flowers of such frailty
and beauty...

630
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:07,820
as to be found nowhere else.

631
01:05:17,706 --> 01:05:19,581
You've described my home...

632
01:05:19,748 --> 01:05:21,916
as if you had seen it firsthand.

633
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:29,090
It's your voice, perhaps.

634
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:31,175
It's so familiar.

635
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:35,097
It's like—

636
01:05:36,516 --> 01:05:39,268
It's like a voice in a dream
I cannot place...

637
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:44,773
and it comforts me.

638
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:47,400
- When I am alone.
- When you are alone.

639
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:11,382
And what of the princess?

640
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:19,724
Princess?

641
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:21,809
There is always a princess...

642
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:26,398
with gowns flowing white.

643
01:06:30,612 --> 01:06:33,697
And her face.

644
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:36,867
Oh, God...

645
01:06:37,034 --> 01:06:38,911
her face...

646
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:44,248
is a river.

647
01:06:49,713 --> 01:06:51,507
The princess...

648
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:56,094
she's a river
filled with tears of sadness...

649
01:06:57,597 --> 01:06:59,514
and heartbreak.

650
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:05,728
There was a princess.

651
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:11,193
Elisabeta.

652
01:07:13,862 --> 01:07:15,739
She was the most radiant woman...

653
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:17,949
in all the empires of the world.

654
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:29,128
Man's deceit took her
from her ancient prince.

655
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:34,090
She leapt to her death...

656
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:36,635
into the river that you spoke of.

657
01:07:37,721 --> 01:07:40,639
In my mother's tongue...

658
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:44,059
it is called...

659
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:47,396
argesh.

660
01:07:49,648 --> 01:07:51,400
River princess.

661
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:29,122
Dear Madam.

662
01:09:29,289 --> 01:09:32,167
Your fiancé is safe and in the care...

663
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:34,962
of the good sisters
of the Blessed Sacrament.

664
01:09:36,421 --> 01:09:40,759
Mr. Harker believes your life
is in extreme danger...

665
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:44,262
and he desires with all urgency
that you join him here...

666
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:47,557
so that you may
immediately be married.

667
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:51,353
Yours with all blessings,
Sister Agatha.

668
01:09:54,481 --> 01:09:56,649
My sweet prince.

669
01:09:56,818 --> 01:09:59,444
Jonathan must never know of us.

670
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:11,832
Dr. Van Helsing.

671
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,127
And you're Madam Mina,
dear friend to our Lucy, ja?

672
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:18,462
- How is she, doctor?
- She's still very weak.

673
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:20,882
She tells me of your
beloved Jonathan Harker...

674
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:23,135
and your worry for him.

675
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:25,470
Well, I, too, worry
for all young lovers.

676
01:10:30,018 --> 01:10:32,603
There are darknesses in life,
my child...

677
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:34,813
and there are lights.

678
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:37,774
You are one of the lights,
dear Mina...

679
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:39,984
the light of all light.

680
01:10:45,490 --> 01:10:47,199
Go now.
See your friend.

681
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:11,015
You look different.

682
01:11:11,184 --> 01:11:14,269
You look positively radiant.

683
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:15,854
You heard from Jonathan.

684
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:18,189
- Didn't you?
- Yes.

685
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:21,859
He's safe.

686
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:24,695
He's in a convent in Romania.

687
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:28,283
He's suffering
from a violent brain fever.

688
01:11:28,451 --> 01:11:30,118
The good sisters
are caring for him.

689
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:34,872
They wrote to me,
and they say he needs me...

690
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:38,042
but I won't go.

691
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:40,462
I'm not going to leave you.

692
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:45,216
You've got to go to him...

693
01:11:45,385 --> 01:11:47,886
and you've got to love him...

694
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:50,221
and marry him
right then and there.

695
01:11:51,556 --> 01:11:55,351
And I want you to take this,
my sister.

696
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,436
It's my wedding gift to you.

697
01:11:59,524 --> 01:12:01,899
Don't worry about
spoiled little Lucy.

698
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:06,697
I'll be all right.

699
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:09,865
Tell Jonathan oceans of love.

700
01:12:24,798 --> 01:12:26,550
Jack, how is she?

701
01:12:45,528 --> 01:12:48,404
This is why I cannot breathe!

702
01:12:48,573 --> 01:12:50,448
Lucy, it's medicinal.

703
01:12:50,615 --> 01:12:52,908
To help you sleep.
To dream better dreams.

704
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:56,078
It's garlic!
It's nothing but common garlic!

705
01:12:56,247 --> 01:12:59,457
Quincey's here to see you.
Get some brandy.

706
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:03,295
Now, Miss Lucy,
you just rest easy.

707
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:05,296
Arthur sent me
to take care of you.

708
01:13:06,506 --> 01:13:07,882
He said
if you don't get better quick...

709
01:13:08,051 --> 01:13:11,052
I have to put you out of your misery
like a lame horse.

710
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:16,475
You're such a beast.

711
01:13:19,811 --> 01:13:21,729
Will you kiss me?

712
01:13:24,817 --> 01:13:27,234
Kiss me.

713
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:38,662
- That old coot!
- Get off me!

714
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:42,208
Listen to me!
Sleep, sleep now. Sleep.

715
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:47,338
You're at peace.

716
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:51,301
Look. There. There.

717
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:56,222
Nosferatu.

718
01:14:10,195 --> 01:14:12,738
"Here occurs the shocking
and frightening history...

719
01:14:12,907 --> 01:14:16,827
of the wild,
berserk Prince Dracula.

720
01:14:16,993 --> 01:14:19,203
How he impaled people
and roasted them...

721
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:20,956
boiled their heads in a kettle...

722
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:23,375
how he skinned them alive...

723
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:27,212
and hacked them to pieces
and then drank their blood."

724
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:33,844
Dracul.

725
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:36,555
For blood is the life.

726
01:14:51,362 --> 01:14:55,614
"My dearest Prince, forgive me.

727
01:14:55,783 --> 01:14:59,327
I have received word
from my fiancé in Romania.

728
01:14:59,494 --> 01:15:02,622
I am en route to join him.
We are to be married.

729
01:15:03,707 --> 01:15:06,251
I will never see you again.

730
01:15:06,418 --> 01:15:08,127
Mina."

731
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:20,097
It is odd,
but I feel almost...

732
01:15:20,265 --> 01:15:22,893
that my strange friend
is with me.

733
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,895
He speaks to me in my thoughts.

734
01:15:26,063 --> 01:15:29,106
With him I felt more alive
than ever I had.

735
01:15:29,274 --> 01:15:32,109
And now without him,
soon to be a bride...

736
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:34,988
I feel confused and lost.

737
01:15:35,155 --> 01:15:39,158
Perhaps, though I try to be good,
I am bad.

738
01:15:39,327 --> 01:15:42,287
Perhaps I am a bad,
inconstant woman.

739
01:16:00,472 --> 01:16:02,765
Winds!

740
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:15,819
It is the cause.

741
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:18,657
It is the cause of my soul!

742
01:16:18,823 --> 01:16:20,199
It is Dracula...

743
01:16:20,368 --> 01:16:22,493
the undead...

744
01:16:22,662 --> 01:16:25,663
the foe I have pursued
all my life.

745
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:31,586
Dracula!

746
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:36,591
Jack, hurry!
I have much to tell you.

747
01:16:39,345 --> 01:16:41,179
Guard her well, Mr. Morris.

748
01:16:41,346 --> 01:16:43,765
Do not fail here tonight.

749
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:46,850
We are dealing with forces
beyond all human experience...

750
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:49,020
an enormous power,
so guard her well.

751
01:16:49,188 --> 01:16:52,815
Otherwise your precious Lucy
will become a bitch of the devil...

752
01:16:52,984 --> 01:16:54,859
a whore of darkness!

753
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:58,363
You're a sick old buzzard.

754
01:16:59,948 --> 01:17:01,865
Hear me out, young man.

755
01:17:02,033 --> 01:17:04,411
Lucy is not a random victim
attacked by mere accident.

756
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:06,162
Do you understand? No.

757
01:17:06,329 --> 01:17:10,417
She is a willing recruit,
a breathless, wanton follower.

758
01:17:10,583 --> 01:17:13,086
I dare say, a devoted disciple.

759
01:17:13,253 --> 01:17:15,713
She is the devil's concubine!

760
01:17:17,507 --> 01:17:18,757
Do you understand me?

761
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:23,637
Yet, we may still save
her precious soul.

762
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:27,475
But not on an empty stomach.

763
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:29,853
- Jack!
- Here, sir.

764
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:32,730
I starve. Feed me.

765
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:35,358
You old coot!

766
01:19:50,368 --> 01:19:53,537
Your impotent men
with their foolish spells...

767
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:57,833
cannot protect you
from my power.

768
01:20:10,221 --> 01:20:13,725
I condemn you to living death...

769
01:20:13,893 --> 01:20:17,020
to eternal hunger...

770
01:20:17,188 --> 01:20:21,440
for living blood.

771
01:21:54,993 --> 01:21:58,954
I know how deeply you loved her. That
is why you must trust me and believe.

772
01:21:59,122 --> 01:22:01,248
Believe?
How can I believe?

773
01:22:01,417 --> 01:22:05,127
I want you to bring me, before
nightfall, a set of postmortem knives.

774
01:22:05,296 --> 01:22:07,296
An autopsy? Lucy?

775
01:22:07,463 --> 01:22:11,009
No, not exactly. I just want to cut off
her head and take out her heart.

776
01:22:19,018 --> 01:22:21,853
Diary, 17th September.

777
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:25,648
Poor Jonathan.
He's still so ill.

778
01:22:25,815 --> 01:22:29,027
He's cheered by
the familiar streets in London.

779
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:33,363
For me, now that Lucy is dead,
it is a sad homecoming.

780
01:22:34,490 --> 01:22:37,034
It is as if a part of me
is dead too...

781
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:39,996
except for the tiny hope
that lives in me...

782
01:22:40,163 --> 01:22:42,623
that I will again
see my prince.

783
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:44,667
Is he here?

784
01:22:44,835 --> 01:22:46,336
Now that I am married...

785
01:22:46,502 --> 01:22:50,547
I begin to understand the nature
of my feelings for my strange friend...

786
01:22:50,716 --> 01:22:53,134
who is always in my thoughts.

787
01:23:04,188 --> 01:23:06,229
Jonathan, what is it?

788
01:23:06,398 --> 01:23:08,274
It is the man himself.

789
01:23:08,442 --> 01:23:10,609
Look, he's grown young.

790
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:58,658
Gentlemen, must we desecrate
poor Lucy's grave?

791
01:23:58,826 --> 01:24:00,743
She died horribly enough.

792
01:24:03,454 --> 01:24:06,457
If Miss Lucy is dead,
then no wrong can be done to her.

793
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:09,167
But if she's not dead...

794
01:24:09,336 --> 01:24:11,753
What are you saying, man?
That she's been buried alive?

795
01:24:11,921 --> 01:24:16,926
No. All I say is
she is undead.

796
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:19,220
Undead.

797
01:24:19,387 --> 01:24:21,180
This is insane.

798
01:24:40,408 --> 01:24:42,618
Gentlemen, shall we?

799
01:24:42,786 --> 01:24:45,747
One, two, three.

800
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:04,515
Where is she?

801
01:25:08,936 --> 01:25:11,855
What have you done with her?

802
01:25:12,024 --> 01:25:14,149
She lives beyond
the grace of God...

803
01:25:14,318 --> 01:25:16,485
a wanderer in the outer darkness.

804
01:25:16,653 --> 01:25:20,530
She is vampyre, nosferatu.

805
01:25:20,698 --> 01:25:23,658
These creatures do not die
like the bee after the first sting...

806
01:25:23,827 --> 01:25:26,162
but instead grow strong
and become immortal...

807
01:25:26,329 --> 01:25:28,413
once infected
by another nosferatu.

808
01:25:34,046 --> 01:25:36,838
So my friends,
we fight not one beast...

809
01:25:37,006 --> 01:25:40,384
but legions that go on
age after age after age...

810
01:25:40,551 --> 01:25:42,552
feeding on the blood
of the living.

811
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:51,270
Quickly, hide. Now.

812
01:26:28,266 --> 01:26:31,394
Come to me, Arthur.

813
01:26:31,561 --> 01:26:34,604
Leave these others
and come to me.

814
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:39,609
My arms are hungry for you,
my darling.

815
01:26:39,778 --> 01:26:43,322
Kiss me and caress me...

816
01:26:43,489 --> 01:26:45,783
my darling husband, please.

817
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:48,618
We wave Christ
and His holy blood!

818
01:26:48,787 --> 01:26:51,413
We are strong in the Lord
and the power of His might!

819
01:26:55,961 --> 01:26:57,920
The power of God is upon us!

820
01:27:09,975 --> 01:27:12,601
I bring you from shadow
into light!

821
01:27:12,769 --> 01:27:15,813
I cast you out,
the prince of darkness...

822
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:17,105
into hell!

823
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:22,612
A moment's courage,
and it is done.

824
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:24,654
Take the stake
in your left hand...

825
01:27:26,867 --> 01:27:29,493
place the point over the heart.

826
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:35,917
Then in God's name, strike.
Do it now!

827
01:27:51,515 --> 01:27:56,520
Eat, feast. You'll need your strength
for the dark days ahead.

828
01:27:59,690 --> 01:28:02,234
- Doctor?
- Ja?

829
01:28:02,402 --> 01:28:03,985
How did Lucy die?

830
01:28:07,198 --> 01:28:08,282
Well—

831
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:11,702
Was she in great pain?

832
01:28:11,869 --> 01:28:14,497
Ja, she was in great pain.
Then we cut off her head...

833
01:28:14,664 --> 01:28:17,832
drove a stake through her heart and
burned it and then she found peace.

834
01:28:18,001 --> 01:28:21,295
Doctor! Please.

835
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,009
So, Mr. Harker...

836
01:28:27,176 --> 01:28:30,054
I must now ask you,
as your doctor...

837
01:28:32,932 --> 01:28:34,684
a sensitive question.

838
01:28:34,850 --> 01:28:37,353
During your infidelity
with those creatures...

839
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:39,020
those demonic women...

840
01:28:39,189 --> 01:28:42,524
did you, for one instant,
taste of their blood?

841
01:28:54,328 --> 01:28:55,371
Good!

842
01:28:55,538 --> 01:28:58,039
Then you have not infected your blood
with the terrible...

843
01:28:58,207 --> 01:29:00,583
disease that destroyed poor Lucy.

844
01:29:09,136 --> 01:29:11,761
Doctor, you must understand.

845
01:29:13,431 --> 01:29:15,850
I doubted everything...

846
01:29:16,018 --> 01:29:17,600
even my mind.

847
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:19,811
I was impotent with fear.

848
01:29:19,979 --> 01:29:22,773
- I know.
- But, sir...

849
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:26,694
I know where the bastard sleeps.

850
01:29:26,862 --> 01:29:30,530
I brought him there,
to Carfax Abbey.

851
01:29:33,284 --> 01:29:36,912
Vampires do exist.

852
01:29:37,079 --> 01:29:40,123
And this one we fight,
this one we face...

853
01:29:40,292 --> 01:29:42,792
has the strength
of 20 or more people...

854
01:29:42,961 --> 01:29:44,962
and you can testify for that,
Mr. Harker.

855
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:48,215
But he can also control
the meaner things of life...

856
01:29:48,382 --> 01:29:50,426
the bat, the rodent, the wolf.

857
01:29:50,594 --> 01:29:54,680
He can appear as mist, as vapor,
as fog and vanish at will.

858
01:29:55,347 --> 01:29:57,349
Now, all these things
Dracula can do...

859
01:29:57,516 --> 01:29:59,143
but he is not free.

860
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:02,645
He must rest in the sacred earth
of his homeland to gain his evil power.

861
01:30:02,814 --> 01:30:06,649
It is here that we must find him
and destroy him utterly.

862
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:09,819
I almost feel pity for anything
so hunted as this count.

863
01:30:09,988 --> 01:30:12,198
How can you pity
such a creature?

864
01:30:13,992 --> 01:30:15,326
I'll take Mina to my quarters.

865
01:30:15,493 --> 01:30:17,953
Good. You'll be safer there.

866
01:30:20,664 --> 01:30:22,957
Mr. Morris, your bullets
will not harm him.

867
01:30:23,126 --> 01:30:26,462
He must be beheaded.
I suggest you use your big bowie knife.

868
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:29,506
Well, I wasn't planning
on getting that close, Doc.

869
01:30:30,759 --> 01:30:32,342
Master!

870
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:51,319
Dr. Jack!

871
01:30:51,488 --> 01:30:54,364
I've been promised eternal life!

872
01:30:57,034 --> 01:30:59,328
Dr. Seward, who is that man?

873
01:30:59,496 --> 01:31:01,997
Mr. Renfield. This is no place for you,
Madam Mina.

874
01:31:02,164 --> 01:31:05,292
Renfield? I must see him.

875
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:09,880
Mr. Renfield, behave yourself.

876
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:14,217
This is Mrs. Harker.

877
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:19,722
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mr. Renfield.

878
01:31:19,890 --> 01:31:22,560
It seems I've been
rather naughty.

879
01:31:25,063 --> 01:31:26,939
I know you.

880
01:31:27,106 --> 01:31:29,024
You're the bride
my master covets.

881
01:31:31,569 --> 01:31:34,238
I have a husband.

882
01:31:34,405 --> 01:31:35,989
I am Mrs. Harker.

883
01:31:37,283 --> 01:31:40,118
My master tells me about you.

884
01:31:41,246 --> 01:31:42,621
What does he tell you?

885
01:31:43,707 --> 01:31:45,207
That he is coming.

886
01:31:47,002 --> 01:31:49,086
That he is coming for you.

887
01:31:50,130 --> 01:31:52,172
Oh, please.

888
01:31:58,262 --> 01:32:00,264
Don't stay here.

889
01:32:00,681 --> 01:32:05,310
Get away from these men, please.

890
01:32:06,688 --> 01:32:10,608
And I pray to God
I may never see your sweet face again.

891
01:32:14,279 --> 01:32:16,905
And may the Lord bless
and keep you.

892
01:32:28,126 --> 01:32:31,795
Master! Master!

893
01:32:31,962 --> 01:32:34,631
You promised me eternal life...

894
01:32:35,091 --> 01:32:38,135
but you give it
to the pretty woman!

895
01:32:38,302 --> 01:32:40,304
Dr. Jack!

896
01:32:40,471 --> 01:32:42,430
I'm no lunatic man!

897
01:32:42,599 --> 01:32:45,475
I'm a sane man
fighting for his soul!

898
01:32:45,644 --> 01:32:49,520
My quarters are spare, but I think
you will find them comfortable.

899
01:32:49,689 --> 01:32:51,523
Dr. Jack!

900
01:32:51,690 --> 01:32:54,484
Water and toiletries
at your disposal.

901
01:32:56,820 --> 01:32:59,239
You'll be completely safe here.

902
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:04,887
Destroy every box.
Sterilize the earth inside.

903
01:34:05,055 --> 01:34:06,931
Leave him no refuge.

904
01:34:07,309 --> 01:34:09,560
Let the exorcism begin.

905
01:34:38,965 --> 01:34:42,009
You have betrayed me.

906
01:34:45,971 --> 01:34:47,930
No, master.

907
01:34:52,145 --> 01:34:54,438
I serve you.

908
01:34:54,605 --> 01:34:57,440
I serve only you.

909
01:35:54,873 --> 01:35:58,001
Oh, yes, my love.

910
01:35:58,168 --> 01:36:00,587
You've found me.

911
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:06,176
My most precious life.

912
01:36:06,344 --> 01:36:09,430
I have wanted this to happen.

913
01:36:09,596 --> 01:36:11,515
I know that now.

914
01:36:13,350 --> 01:36:16,811
I want to be with you always.

915
01:36:16,979 --> 01:36:21,524
You cannot know
what you are saying.

916
01:36:21,693 --> 01:36:23,652
Yes...

917
01:36:23,819 --> 01:36:25,904
I do know.

918
01:36:38,792 --> 01:36:42,837
I feared I would never feel
your touch again.

919
01:36:43,006 --> 01:36:44,881
I thought you were dead.

920
01:36:52,055 --> 01:36:56,143
There is no life in this body.

921
01:37:00,273 --> 01:37:02,231
But you live.

922
01:37:03,943 --> 01:37:05,903
You live.

923
01:37:07,572 --> 01:37:09,489
What are you?

924
01:37:10,783 --> 01:37:13,911
I must know.
You must tell me.

925
01:37:21,252 --> 01:37:23,170
I am...

926
01:37:24,588 --> 01:37:26,881
nothing.

927
01:37:27,050 --> 01:37:28,425
Lifeless.

928
01:37:30,427 --> 01:37:32,470
- Soulless.
- What do you mean?

929
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:35,556
Hated and feared.

930
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:39,728
I am dead to all the world.

931
01:37:39,895 --> 01:37:41,771
Hear me.

932
01:37:43,774 --> 01:37:45,817
I am the monster...

933
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:48,069
that breathing men would kill.

934
01:37:49,447 --> 01:37:52,032
I am Dracula.

935
01:38:07,798 --> 01:38:09,966
You murdered Lucy!

936
01:38:23,146 --> 01:38:25,106
I love you.

937
01:38:26,442 --> 01:38:30,820
Oh, God, forgive me, I do.

938
01:38:49,423 --> 01:38:52,050
I want to be what you are...

939
01:38:52,217 --> 01:38:53,551
see what you see...

940
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:55,636
love what you love.

941
01:38:59,266 --> 01:39:01,810
To walk with me...

942
01:39:01,978 --> 01:39:05,188
you must die
to your breathing life...

943
01:39:05,355 --> 01:39:08,483
and be reborn to mine.

944
01:39:08,650 --> 01:39:11,862
You are my love...

945
01:39:12,029 --> 01:39:14,655
and my life always.

946
01:39:22,623 --> 01:39:24,373
Then...

947
01:39:24,542 --> 01:39:26,917
I give you life eternal...

948
01:39:28,712 --> 01:39:30,713
everlasting love...

949
01:39:32,257 --> 01:39:36,052
the power of the storm...

950
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:39,890
and the beasts of the earth.

951
01:39:40,057 --> 01:39:42,225
Walk with me...

952
01:39:42,393 --> 01:39:46,063
to be my loving wife forever.

953
01:39:46,229 --> 01:39:49,024
I will. Yes. Yes.

954
01:40:20,097 --> 01:40:23,015
Drink and join me...

955
01:40:24,101 --> 01:40:26,560
in eternal life.

956
01:40:41,786 --> 01:40:43,244
I cannot let this be.

957
01:40:44,913 --> 01:40:48,207
Please, I don't care.
Make me yours.

958
01:40:48,376 --> 01:40:52,421
You will be cursed as I am
to walk in the shadow of death...

959
01:40:52,587 --> 01:40:54,296
. for all eternity.

960
01:40:54,465 --> 01:40:59,219
I love you too much...

961
01:40:59,386 --> 01:41:00,804
to condemn you.

962
01:41:00,971 --> 01:41:06,100
Then take me away
from all this death.

963
01:42:03,367 --> 01:42:06,661
You think you can destroy me...

964
01:42:06,828 --> 01:42:09,163
with your idols?

965
01:42:12,126 --> 01:42:14,752
Sacred blood of Christ!

966
01:42:14,921 --> 01:42:17,838
I, who served the cross.

967
01:42:18,006 --> 01:42:20,341
I, who commanded nations...

968
01:42:20,510 --> 01:42:23,511
hundreds of years
before you were born.

969
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:25,680
Your armies were defeated.

970
01:42:25,847 --> 01:42:29,725
You tortured and impaled
thousands of people.

971
01:42:29,894 --> 01:42:33,063
I was betrayed.

972
01:42:33,230 --> 01:42:36,149
Look what your God...

973
01:42:36,317 --> 01:42:39,069
has done to me.

974
01:42:39,237 --> 01:42:42,238
No, your war with God is over.
You must pay for your crimes.

975
01:42:47,662 --> 01:42:48,912
Christ compels you!

976
01:42:49,079 --> 01:42:52,582
She is now...

977
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:56,043
my bride!

978
01:43:00,716 --> 01:43:01,966
More light!

979
01:43:03,761 --> 01:43:07,096
Light! More light!

980
01:43:14,771 --> 01:43:16,021
Unclean.

981
01:43:19,150 --> 01:43:20,277
- Get them!
- This way!

982
01:43:20,444 --> 01:43:21,778
- Get them!
- They must be found.

983
01:43:22,113 --> 01:43:23,113
Unclean.

984
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:25,614
We have learned something much.

985
01:43:25,783 --> 01:43:29,536
Dracula fears us.
He fears time.

986
01:43:29,703 --> 01:43:32,788
For, if not,
why does he hurry so?

987
01:43:32,957 --> 01:43:35,708
He is gone.

988
01:43:35,877 --> 01:43:38,127
How do you know?

989
01:43:38,296 --> 01:43:41,088
He speaks to me.

990
01:43:42,173 --> 01:43:44,634
He has a strong
mind connection to you.

991
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:49,639
His heart was strong enough
to survive the grave.

992
01:43:50,932 --> 01:43:54,019
- You admire him.
- Ja.

993
01:43:54,185 --> 01:43:58,480
He was, in life,
a most remarkable man...

994
01:43:58,649 --> 01:44:01,318
and his mind
was great and powerful...

995
01:44:01,484 --> 01:44:04,445
but greater is the necessity
to stamp him out...

996
01:44:04,613 --> 01:44:06,488
and destroy him utterly.

997
01:44:07,658 --> 01:44:09,576
- Doctor?
- Ja?

998
01:44:12,622 --> 01:44:16,291
I know that I am
becoming like him.

999
01:44:16,458 --> 01:44:19,836
Your salvation
is his destruction.

1000
01:44:20,003 --> 01:44:23,715
That is why
I want to hypnotize you.

1001
01:44:23,882 --> 01:44:27,844
I want you to help me find him
before it is too late.

1002
01:44:28,011 --> 01:44:31,514
Please, help me find him.
Please.

1003
01:44:31,681 --> 01:44:34,059
Look into this light...

1004
01:44:34,225 --> 01:44:36,936
the light of all light,
into this flame.

1005
01:44:38,021 --> 01:44:39,939
Your eyes are heavy.

1006
01:44:41,609 --> 01:44:44,319
You want to sleep.
Sleep now.

1007
01:44:47,323 --> 01:44:51,117
- Sleep.
- I must go to him.

1008
01:44:51,284 --> 01:44:53,619
He calls.

1009
01:44:53,787 --> 01:44:55,204
What do you hear?

1010
01:44:57,541 --> 01:44:59,960
What do you hear, child?

1011
01:45:01,045 --> 01:45:03,671
What do you hear?

1012
01:45:03,838 --> 01:45:07,884
Oh, my prince is calling me.

1013
01:45:08,051 --> 01:45:12,596
He is traveling across icy seas
to his beloved home.

1014
01:45:12,765 --> 01:45:15,891
There he will grow strong again.

1015
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:19,729
I am coming to him
to partake of his strength.

1016
01:45:25,528 --> 01:45:30,364
We left London by train and crossed
the English Channel in stormy seas...

1017
01:45:30,533 --> 01:45:33,576
no doubt from the passage
of the count's ship.

1018
01:45:33,743 --> 01:45:38,122
He commands the winds,
but we still have the advantage.

1019
01:45:38,289 --> 01:45:41,917
By train, we can reach the Romanian
port at Varna in three days.

1020
01:45:42,086 --> 01:45:44,753
By ship, it will take him
at least a week.

1021
01:45:46,256 --> 01:45:49,259
From Paris, we traveled
through the Alps to Budapest.

1022
01:45:49,426 --> 01:45:52,011
The count must sail around
the Rock of Gibraltar...

1023
01:45:52,179 --> 01:45:53,930
where we have posted a lookout...

1024
01:45:54,097 --> 01:45:56,850
and then on to the Black Sea port
in Varna...

1025
01:45:57,018 --> 01:46:00,310
where we will meet his ship
and burn it into the sea.

1026
01:46:06,402 --> 01:46:09,529
Home. Home.

1027
01:46:19,289 --> 01:46:22,000
The vampire's baptized her
with his own blood...

1028
01:46:22,167 --> 01:46:24,252
and her blood is dying,
my friend.

1029
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:26,296
It is no use.

1030
01:46:38,725 --> 01:46:41,978
I will not let you go
into the unknown alone.

1031
01:46:42,145 --> 01:46:46,356
Oh, my poor, dear Jonathan.

1032
01:46:46,524 --> 01:46:49,234
Oh, what have I done to you?

1033
01:46:50,945 --> 01:46:54,114
No, I have done this
to both of us.

1034
01:46:54,283 --> 01:46:56,493
I can hear him.
He's coming closer.

1035
01:46:56,659 --> 01:46:58,536
He's calling me to him.

1036
01:47:03,333 --> 01:47:05,710
Stay with me. Please.

1037
01:47:05,877 --> 01:47:07,796
I am so cold.

1038
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:21,475
All aboard!

1039
01:47:21,644 --> 01:47:25,313
Noon. Holmwood received a wire
from his clerk at Lloyd's.

1040
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:28,483
The count's ship sailed past us
in the night fog...

1041
01:47:28,650 --> 01:47:30,484
to the northern port of Galatz.

1042
01:47:30,653 --> 01:47:33,822
The black devil
is reading Mina's mind.

1043
01:47:33,988 --> 01:47:36,490
How can we catch him now?

1044
01:47:44,457 --> 01:47:46,876
Varna. Galatz.

1045
01:47:47,043 --> 01:47:48,711
It's about 200 miles.

1046
01:47:48,878 --> 01:47:51,046
I think that with the horses,
we can cut him off...

1047
01:47:51,215 --> 01:47:53,048
reach him before
he reaches the castle.

1048
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:56,219
I will dispatch Van Helsing
straight for the Borgo Pass.

1049
01:47:56,386 --> 01:47:57,886
If we fail in our task...

1050
01:47:58,055 --> 01:47:59,930
you will have to finish him.

1051
01:48:04,811 --> 01:48:08,064
From Varna, Mina and Van Helsing
took a carriage...

1052
01:48:08,231 --> 01:48:10,942
and we continued
on the train towards Galatz...

1053
01:48:11,109 --> 01:48:14,904
where we still hoped to intercept
the count before he reaches land.

1054
01:48:15,072 --> 01:48:19,826
I am fearful for Mina.
She is now our decoy.

1055
01:48:32,256 --> 01:48:34,047
I know this place.

1056
01:48:34,216 --> 01:48:36,926
- The end of the world.
- We must go on.

1057
01:48:37,094 --> 01:48:38,927
It is late, child.
We must rest here now.

1058
01:48:39,095 --> 01:48:41,555
No, we must go!

1059
01:48:41,724 --> 01:48:43,349
He needs me.
We must go!

1060
01:48:47,854 --> 01:48:49,730
We have passed Bistritza.

1061
01:48:49,899 --> 01:48:52,567
Dracula has outsmarted us again.

1062
01:48:52,734 --> 01:48:56,445
We learned that his gypsies took
charge of the vampire's box at Galatz...

1063
01:48:56,613 --> 01:49:00,199
and are now on
the Borgo Pass road.

1064
01:49:16,132 --> 01:49:19,594
- Here. You must eat.
- I am not hungry.

1065
01:50:11,771 --> 01:50:14,774
You have been so good to me,
Professor.

1066
01:50:24,368 --> 01:50:28,203
I know that Lucy harbored
secret desires for you.

1067
01:50:28,372 --> 01:50:30,747
She told me.

1068
01:50:30,916 --> 01:50:33,960
I, too, know what men desire.

1069
01:50:50,601 --> 01:50:52,478
Will you cut off my head...

1070
01:50:52,645 --> 01:50:54,564
and drive a stake
through my heart...

1071
01:50:54,731 --> 01:50:58,067
as you did poor Lucy,
you murdering bastard?

1072
01:51:02,155 --> 01:51:05,615
Not while I live.
I am sworn to protect you.

1073
01:51:22,384 --> 01:51:24,801
You are safe within the circle.

1074
01:51:24,970 --> 01:51:28,472
I've lost Lucy.
I'll not lose you to him.

1075
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:29,974
You're whores of Satan!

1076
01:51:34,270 --> 01:51:36,229
This is holy ground.

1077
01:51:36,398 --> 01:51:38,231
Leave this place now!

1078
01:51:40,234 --> 01:51:42,278
Leave!

1079
01:51:42,945 --> 01:51:45,655
In the name of God,
leave this ground!

1080
01:51:45,823 --> 01:51:47,742
I command you
in the name of Christ!

1081
01:51:59,796 --> 01:52:02,715
Christ! Damn you!

1082
01:52:39,837 --> 01:52:41,796
Dracul!

1083
01:53:20,543 --> 01:53:22,587
You are...

1084
01:53:22,753 --> 01:53:25,046
near.

1085
01:53:25,215 --> 01:53:27,132
My love.

1086
01:53:39,229 --> 01:53:40,604
They're racing
against the sunset.

1087
01:53:40,771 --> 01:53:42,731
It may be too late.
God help us.

1088
01:54:24,190 --> 01:54:25,565
Harker, shoot!

1089
01:54:34,326 --> 01:54:36,034
Charge!

1090
01:57:17,698 --> 01:57:20,323
When my time comes,
will you do the same to me?

1091
01:57:23,494 --> 01:57:24,578
Will you?

1092
01:57:31,086 --> 01:57:32,502
- Wait.
- Let them go.

1093
01:57:32,671 --> 01:57:36,506
Let them go.
Our work is finished here.

1094
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:38,926
Hers has just begun.

1095
01:58:03,118 --> 01:58:05,828
We've all become God's madmen.

1096
01:58:08,331 --> 01:58:10,248
All of us.

1097
01:58:19,509 --> 01:58:23,304
Where is my God?

1098
01:58:23,471 --> 01:58:26,681
He has forsaken me.

1099
01:58:32,898 --> 01:58:36,192
It is finished.

1100
01:58:38,194 --> 01:58:40,154
My love.

1101
01:58:44,493 --> 01:58:45,826
My love.

1102
01:58:54,168 --> 01:58:56,587
There, in the presence of God...

1103
01:58:56,755 --> 01:58:59,672
I understood at last
how my love could release us all...

1104
01:58:59,841 --> 01:59:01,716
from the powers of darkness.

1105
01:59:08,057 --> 01:59:10,643
Our love is stronger than death.

1106
01:59:18,859 --> 01:59:21,737
Give me peace.
