1
00:00:39,251 --> 00:00:45,799
The year, 1462.
Constantinople had fallen.

2
00:00:46,007 --> 00:00:54,015
Moslem Turks swept into Europe,
threatening all of Christendom.

3
00:00:54,182 --> 00:00:58,645
From Transylvania arose
a Romanian knight.

4
00:00:58,895 --> 00:01:02,315
Dracula.

5
00:01:17,038 --> 00:01:25,463
On the eve of the battle,
his bride, Elizabetha,

6
00:01:25,672 --> 00:01:29,885
knew that he must face
an insurmountable force

7
00:01:30,051 --> 00:01:35,140
from which he might never return.

8
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:48,046
Elizabetha...

9
00:02:49,756 --> 00:02:54,553
The vengeful Turks
shot a message into the castle.

10
00:02:54,761 --> 00:02:57,305
It told of Dracula’s death.

11
00:02:57,514 --> 00:03:03,353
Elizabetha, believing him dead,
flung herself into the river.

12
00:03:39,222 --> 00:03:46,438
My prince is dead.
All is lost without him.

13
00:03:46,605 --> 00:03:50,525
May God unite us in heaven.

14
00:06:02,407 --> 00:06:07,287
I've done everything
you asked, Master.

15
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:12,459
All the preparations are in order.
Everything.

16
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:17,214
I await your command, for I know

17
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,510
that when the rewards are given,

18
00:06:21,676 --> 00:06:27,015
I will be one of those
who benefits from your generosity.

19
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,063
Thank you.

20
00:06:34,314 --> 00:06:37,067
Renfield is deranged.

21
00:06:38,818 --> 00:06:43,615
He's lost his mind, poor chap.
Take over his foreign client,

22
00:06:43,823 --> 00:06:48,203
this eccentric Count Dracula.
He's buying up property in London.

23
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:52,207
Of course, sir.
Thank you for your confidence.

24
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:58,588
This is a great opportunity, Harker.
Leave for Transylvania immediately.

25
00:06:58,755 --> 00:07:04,928
Opportunities such as this
come but once in a lifetime.

26
00:07:05,095 --> 00:07:10,684
May I enquire, what happened
to Mr. Renfield in Transylvania?

27
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:14,688
Nothing... Personal problems.

28
00:07:14,896 --> 00:07:20,026
Close these transactions, and your
future with this firm is assured.

29
00:07:20,235 --> 00:07:24,531
Yes, sir.
I will give it my full attention.

30
00:07:26,741 --> 00:07:29,661
We've waited this long...

31
00:07:29,828 --> 00:07:35,417
- We can be married when I return.
- Of course.

32
00:07:35,584 --> 00:07:42,174
- I will write.
- Jonathan...

33
00:07:45,177 --> 00:07:50,307
- Jonathan, I love you.
- I love you, Mina.

34
00:08:19,461 --> 00:08:24,424
25th May, Budapest.
Left Budapest early this morning.

35
00:08:24,633 --> 00:08:27,636
We're leaving the West...

36
00:08:30,722 --> 00:08:34,059
We're traveling to the far east
of the country.

37
00:08:34,267 --> 00:08:38,647
To the border of Transylvania,
Moldavia and Bukovina

38
00:08:38,855 --> 00:08:44,778
in the Carpathian mountains.
One of the wildest areas of Europe.

39
00:08:47,155 --> 00:08:52,911
My friend,
welcome to the Carpathians.

40
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:56,456
I am anxiously expecting you.

41
00:08:56,665 --> 00:09:02,254
At the Borgo Pass,
my carriage will await you.

42
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:07,300
I trust your journey from London
has been a happy one.

43
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:13,473
And I hope you will enjoy your stay
in my beautiful land.

44
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,186
Your friend... D.

45
00:09:25,694 --> 00:09:32,158
Diary, 25th May. My dear Jonathan
has been gone almost a week.

46
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:36,037
I wish we'd married
before his departure,

47
00:09:36,246 --> 00:09:42,335
but I am happy he was sent
on this important mission.

48
00:09:42,544 --> 00:09:46,590
It must be so nice
to see strange countries.

49
00:09:46,756 --> 00:09:53,013
I wonder if Jonathan and I
shall ever see them together.

50
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:10,322
We're early, driver.
No one is here.

51
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:32,946
I say, is the castle far?

52
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:53,777
Welcome to my home.

53
00:12:53,985 --> 00:12:59,115
Enter of your own will and leave
some of the happiness you bring.

54
00:12:59,324 --> 00:13:05,163
- Count Dracula?
- I am Dracula.

55
00:13:05,372 --> 00:13:10,252
And I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker,
to my house.

56
00:13:12,337 --> 00:13:15,423
Come in.

57
00:13:29,396 --> 00:13:36,695
You will, I trust, excuse me
that I do not join you.

58
00:13:38,446 --> 00:13:45,495
I have already dined
and I never drink...

59
00:13:47,455 --> 00:13:49,666
...wine.

60
00:13:54,671 --> 00:13:59,801
An ancestor?
I see a resemblance.

61
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:04,472
The order of the Dracul...

62
00:14:04,681 --> 00:14:07,517
...is a dragon.

63
00:14:07,684 --> 00:14:13,773
An ancient society
pledging my forefathers

64
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:19,779
to defend the church
against all enemies of Christ.

65
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:27,496
That relationship
was not entirely... successful.

66
00:14:27,704 --> 00:14:30,373
Oh, yes...

67
00:14:34,544 --> 00:14:38,757
It is no laughing matter!

68
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:44,262
We Draculs have a right to be proud.

69
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:51,770
No devil was greater than Attila,
whose blood flows in these veins.

70
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,319
Blood...

71
00:15:01,863 --> 00:15:07,619
...is too precious a thing
in these times.

72
00:15:10,372 --> 00:15:14,668
The warlike days are over.

73
00:15:15,794 --> 00:15:22,509
The victories of my great race
are but a tale to be told.

74
00:15:26,054 --> 00:15:31,226
I am the last of my kind.

75
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:38,483
I have offended you
with my ignorance. Forgive me.

76
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:56,209
I long to go through the crowded
streets of your mighty London.

77
00:15:56,418 --> 00:16:01,131
To be in the midst of the whirl
and the rush of humanity.

78
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:06,845
To share its life, its changes...
its death.

79
00:16:07,012 --> 00:16:11,057
There. You, Count...

80
00:16:12,893 --> 00:16:17,814
... are the owner of Carfax Abbey.
Congratulations.

81
00:16:18,023 --> 00:16:22,319
Your firm writes most highly
of your talents.

82
00:16:22,485 --> 00:16:28,491
They say
you are a man of good... taste.

83
00:16:29,743 --> 00:16:37,292
And that you are a worthy substitute
to your predecessor, Mr. Renfield.

84
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:40,295
You may rely on me.

85
00:16:40,462 --> 00:16:45,342
I'm curious. Why ten houses
in such precise locations?

86
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:50,055
Is it to raise the market value?

87
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:54,935
Do you believe in destiny?

88
00:16:56,645 --> 00:17:01,441
That even the powers of time

89
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:07,155
can be altered
for a single purpose?

90
00:17:14,037 --> 00:17:22,379
The luckiest man on earth
is the one who finds... true love.

91
00:17:22,546 --> 00:17:27,676
You found Mina.
I thought she was lost.

92
00:17:27,884 --> 00:17:34,599
We're to be married when I return.
Are you married, Count?

93
00:17:34,766 --> 00:17:38,353
Sir, are you married?

94
00:17:38,562 --> 00:17:41,982
I was married once.

95
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:47,612
Ages ago, it seems.
She died.

96
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:53,368
- I'm very sorry.
- She was fortunate.

97
00:17:55,996 --> 00:17:59,499
My life, at its best, is misery.

98
00:18:04,337 --> 00:18:08,633
She will, no doubt,
make a devoted wife...

99
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,596
...and you a faithful husband.

100
00:18:14,598 --> 00:18:21,563
Come, write to your firm
and any loved ones.

101
00:18:21,771 --> 00:18:28,278
Say that it should please you
to stay with me for a month.

102
00:18:29,821 --> 00:18:34,701
A month?
Do you wish me to stay so long?

103
00:18:37,454 --> 00:18:41,416
I will take no refusal.

104
00:18:52,677 --> 00:18:55,847
Diary. 30th May, 1897.

105
00:18:56,014 --> 00:19:00,143
Jonathan does not want me
to stay with Lucy while he is away.

106
00:19:00,352 --> 00:19:05,065
If I become accustomed to the
privileges of the Weston family,

107
00:19:05,273 --> 00:19:09,486
he thinks I will not be content
as the wife of a mere clerk.

108
00:19:09,653 --> 00:19:12,405
But Lucy and I are friends.

109
00:19:12,614 --> 00:19:17,744
She has never minded
that I am only a schoolmistress.

110
00:19:25,085 --> 00:19:27,128
Disgusting!

111
00:19:30,131 --> 00:19:33,844
Mina...

112
00:19:37,347 --> 00:19:41,476
Mina, you're always working.

113
00:19:41,643 --> 00:19:47,148
Is your ambitious John Harker
forcing you to learn that machine?

114
00:19:47,315 --> 00:19:54,114
He could be forcing you into acts
of passion on the parlor floor.

115
00:19:54,281 --> 00:19:59,161
Lucy! You shouldn't talk about
my fiancé in such a way.

116
00:19:59,327 --> 00:20:02,747
There's more to marriage
than carnal pleasures.

117
00:20:02,956 --> 00:20:08,712
So I see... much, much more!

118
00:20:15,468 --> 00:20:20,515
What is it, Lucy?
I don't understand it.

119
00:20:20,724 --> 00:20:25,353
Can man and woman
really do... that?

120
00:20:25,562 --> 00:20:29,774
- I did... only last night.
- Fibber! You did not.

121
00:20:29,941 --> 00:20:35,363
Yes, I did. Well, in my dreams.

122
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:41,203
Jonathan measures up, doesn't he?
You can tell Lucy.

123
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:43,872
We've kissed, that's all.

124
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,210
He thinks he's too poor
to marry me.

125
00:20:48,418 --> 00:20:53,340
It's all the worse now that
I'm visiting you... my rich friend.

126
00:20:53,548 --> 00:20:59,554
Yes, but not one marriage proposal,
and here I am almost 20...

127
00:20:59,721 --> 00:21:01,932
Practically a hag!

128
00:21:07,729 --> 00:21:10,649
Mr. Quincy P. Morris!

129
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,779
Look! What is that?

130
00:21:15,987 --> 00:21:23,203
A Texan. Quincy P. Morris.
He's so young and fresh.

131
00:21:23,411 --> 00:21:28,041
- A wild stallion between my legs.
- You're positively indecent!

132
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:32,420
I just know what men desire.
Watch.

133
00:21:32,629 --> 00:21:35,882
- Quincy, darling.
- Miss Lucy...

134
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:39,386
You're as fresh as a spring rain.

135
00:21:41,263 --> 00:21:46,518
Quincy, please let me touch it.

136
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,731
It's so big.

137
00:21:53,567 --> 00:22:02,075
My dear, sweet little girl. I hold
your hand, and you've kissed me.

138
00:22:02,284 --> 00:22:08,039
Jack! Oceans of love...

139
00:22:08,206 --> 00:22:11,835
Oh, my poor little baby!

140
00:22:12,043 --> 00:22:16,590
Come over here,
my poor little blossom.

141
00:22:16,756 --> 00:22:21,803
My poor, little, brilliant doctor.

142
00:22:22,012 --> 00:22:27,601
- What a naughty bear.
- Arthur Holmwood, Esquire.

143
00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:30,729
My darling.

144
00:22:33,273 --> 00:22:36,276
I'm so sorry about your hat.

145
00:22:36,484 --> 00:22:39,738
This is my snake dress.

146
00:22:39,905 --> 00:22:46,703
Lucy is a pure and virtuous girl,
but she does shock me sometimes.

147
00:22:46,912 --> 00:22:52,417
Jonathan says a defect of the rich
is that they say what they please.

148
00:22:52,584 --> 00:22:57,506
But I admire Lucy and I'm not
surprised men flock around her.

149
00:22:57,714 --> 00:23:02,093
I wish I were as pretty
and as adored as she.

150
00:23:07,974 --> 00:23:12,938
You are the love of my life.

151
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,613
What manner of man is this?

152
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:26,576
R.N. Renfield, successful solicitor
in the firm of Hawkins & Thompkins.

153
00:23:26,785 --> 00:23:29,871
Member of the Wyndham Club.

154
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,543
He returns from business abroad
in Transylvania

155
00:23:34,751 --> 00:23:41,550
and suffers a mental breakdown.
He's obsessed with some bloodlust.

156
00:23:45,053 --> 00:23:47,097
George.

157
00:23:48,974 --> 00:23:51,893
Wait here.

158
00:23:58,316 --> 00:24:04,239
Would you care for an hors d'oeuvre,
doctor, or a canapé?

159
00:24:04,406 --> 00:24:11,621
- No, thank you. How are you?
- Better than my love-sick doctor.

160
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:17,669
- Does my private life interest you?
- Of course. All life interests me.

161
00:24:17,836 --> 00:24:24,384
- Your diet is disgusting.
- They're perfectly nutritious.

162
00:24:24,593 --> 00:24:29,598
Each life that I ingest
gives back life to me.

163
00:24:33,602 --> 00:24:38,315
- A fly gives you life?
- Certainly.

164
00:24:38,523 --> 00:24:45,030
You'll eat molecules with chopsticks
before I eat the lesser carnivore.

165
00:24:45,238 --> 00:24:50,327
I shall have to invent a new
classification of lunatic for you.

166
00:24:50,535 --> 00:24:54,206
What about spiders?
Spiders eat the flies.

167
00:24:55,790 --> 00:25:00,337
- Yes, spiders eat them.
- What about sparrows?

168
00:25:00,545 --> 00:25:06,635
- Yes... did you say sparrows?
- Something larger perhaps?

169
00:25:06,843 --> 00:25:13,433
Oh yes...
A kitten. I beg you!

170
00:25:13,683 --> 00:25:18,063
A little, sleek, playful kitten.
Something I can teach.

171
00:25:18,271 --> 00:25:21,983
Something I can feed.
Don't refuse me.

172
00:25:22,192 --> 00:25:26,655
Wouldn't you prefer a cat?

173
00:25:26,821 --> 00:25:32,744
Yes! A big cat!
My salvation depends upon it.

174
00:25:32,953 --> 00:25:37,582
- Your salvation?
- Yes, lives for the Master.

175
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:41,419
Master? What master?

176
00:25:41,628 --> 00:25:45,131
The Master will come.

177
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:50,220
- He's promised to make me immortal.
- How?

178
00:25:54,808 --> 00:25:58,144
The blood is the life!

179
00:25:58,311 --> 00:26:01,815
Blood is the life!

180
00:26:01,982 --> 00:26:09,281
30th May, Castle Dracula. I think
things that I dare not confess.

181
00:26:09,489 --> 00:26:14,202
The way the Count looked at
Mina's picture fills me with fear.

182
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:19,541
As if I have a part to play
in a story that is not known to me.

183
00:26:42,314 --> 00:26:45,483
I didn't hear you come in.

184
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:54,534
Take care. You cut yourself.
It is more dangerous than you think.

185
00:26:59,873 --> 00:27:04,920
A foul bauble of man's... vanity.

186
00:27:05,128 --> 00:27:09,591
Perhaps you should grow a beard.

187
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:23,688
The letters I requested...
have you written them?

188
00:27:38,912 --> 00:27:41,665
Good.

189
00:27:49,756 --> 00:27:54,386
Should you leave these rooms,

190
00:27:54,594 --> 00:28:00,892
you will not go to sleep
in any other part of the castle.

191
00:28:01,685 --> 00:28:08,567
It is old and has many bad memories.

192
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:16,366
- Be warned.
- I'm sure I understand.

193
00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:26,418
Do not put your faith in such...
trinkets of deceit.

194
00:28:28,253 --> 00:28:35,719
We are in Transylvania,
and Transylvania is not England.

195
00:28:35,886 --> 00:28:39,389
Our ways are not your ways.

196
00:28:39,598 --> 00:28:45,020
And to you...
there shall be many strange things.

197
00:28:45,187 --> 00:28:52,402
I've seen strange things already.
Wolves chasing me! A blue inferno!

198
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,369
Listen to them.

199
00:29:04,164 --> 00:29:08,627
The children of the night.

200
00:29:08,793 --> 00:29:16,384
- What sweet music they make.
- Music? Those animals?

201
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:53,088
I did as Dracula instructed.
I wrote three letters.

202
00:29:53,296 --> 00:29:56,883
To the firm, to my family,
and to my beloved Mina.

203
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:01,763
I said nothing of my fears,
as he will read them, no doubt.

204
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:09,646
I know now that I am a prisoner.

205
00:31:33,146 --> 00:31:35,899
Jonathan...

206
00:31:36,107 --> 00:31:39,694
Jonathan, come to me.

207
00:31:48,078 --> 00:31:51,081
Come.

208
00:32:08,598 --> 00:32:13,478
Lay down.
Lay back into my arms.

209
00:32:22,988 --> 00:32:27,200
Lay back, Jonathan.

210
00:34:16,977 --> 00:34:20,480
What is this? Charlatans!

211
00:35:42,145 --> 00:35:44,981
Dearest Mina, all is well here.

212
00:35:45,148 --> 00:35:50,320
The Count has insisted
that I remain here for a month.

213
00:35:50,529 --> 00:35:56,535
I can say no more, except I
love you. Ever faithful, Jonathan.

214
00:36:00,038 --> 00:36:05,210
The letters I have written
have undoubtedly sealed my doom.

215
00:36:07,671 --> 00:36:13,760
The Count's gypsies, loyal to the
death to whomever they serve.

216
00:36:16,596 --> 00:36:23,812
Day and night, they fill boxes with
earth from the castle's cellar.

217
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:29,442
They are to be delivered
to Carfax Abbey in London.

218
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:35,365
Why do they fill these boxes
with earth?

219
00:36:40,829 --> 00:36:44,082
I love him!

220
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:49,171
Mina, it's so wonderful.
I've decided.

221
00:36:49,337 --> 00:36:53,884
- I love him and I've said yes!
- Finally.

222
00:36:54,092 --> 00:36:58,471
- The Texan with the big knife?
- No, to my number three.

223
00:36:58,638 --> 00:37:05,520
Lord Arthur Holmwood.
You're to be my maid of honor.

224
00:37:05,687 --> 00:37:11,193
Mina, what is it? It's the most
exciting day of my life.

225
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:16,698
- You don't seem to care.
- I'm so worried about Jonathan.

226
00:37:16,907 --> 00:37:23,330
This letter I received is so cold.
It's not like him at all.

227
00:37:23,538 --> 00:37:27,751
Mina, don't worry.

228
00:37:52,234 --> 00:37:57,739
Captain's log, the Demeter.
27th June, 1897.

229
00:37:59,491 --> 00:38:04,913
We picked up 50 boxes of earth
bound for London, England.

230
00:38:05,121 --> 00:38:10,001
We set sail at noon into a storm
that seemed to come from nowhere,

231
00:38:10,168 --> 00:38:13,421
carrying us out to sea.

232
00:38:47,622 --> 00:38:52,335
3rd July. Second mate is missing.
Nearing Gibraltar.

233
00:38:52,502 --> 00:38:55,922
Storm continues.
Crew uneasy.

234
00:38:56,089 --> 00:39:03,388
Believes someone or something
is aboard the ship with us.

235
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:21,448
He is here!
The master of all life is at hand!

236
00:39:21,615 --> 00:39:25,994
Gather round! I am here
to do your bidding, Master!

237
00:39:26,203 --> 00:39:32,209
I have worshipped you from afar,
but now you are near.

238
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:37,672
I am your slave.
I await your command.

239
00:39:37,923 --> 00:39:40,675
The Renfield case
grows more interesting.

240
00:39:40,884 --> 00:39:44,638
There is method in his madness,
with his flies and spiders.

241
00:39:44,846 --> 00:39:51,561
Had I the secret
of even one such brilliant mind...

242
00:39:58,485 --> 00:40:00,612
Lucy...

243
00:40:57,711 --> 00:41:02,090
Lucy!

244
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:45,485
No, do not see me!

245
00:42:56,788 --> 00:43:00,834
Lucy...

246
00:43:01,001 --> 00:43:06,756
- I couldn't control myself.
- You're dreaming. Sleepwalking.

247
00:43:06,965 --> 00:43:11,011
My soul...
It seemed to leave my body.

248
00:43:11,178 --> 00:43:15,223
There was this agonizing feeling.

249
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:20,020
- I started shaking.
- It's all right, you're dreaming.

250
00:43:20,187 --> 00:43:25,233
It pulled me and lured me.
I had no control.

251
00:43:25,442 --> 00:43:33,617
Those red eyes. I still have
the taste of his blood in my mouth.

252
00:43:51,009 --> 00:43:56,681
Master, I'm here to do your bidding.

253
00:43:57,265 --> 00:44:04,231
Master, I am here.
I have worshipped you.

254
00:44:07,067 --> 00:44:11,947
The vampire,
like any other night-creature,

255
00:44:12,155 --> 00:44:18,453
can move about by day, but during
this time his powers are weak.

256
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:38,640
See the amazing cinematograph.

257
00:44:38,807 --> 00:44:43,854
A wonder of modern civilization.
The latest sensation.

258
00:44:44,145 --> 00:44:50,652
The attraction of the century.
The new wonder of the world.

259
00:44:51,945 --> 00:44:55,198
See the amazing cinematograph.

260
00:45:14,301 --> 00:45:17,304
See me.

261
00:45:18,054 --> 00:45:21,391
See me now.

262
00:45:26,188 --> 00:45:31,693
Escaped wolf still at large!
Paper, sir?

263
00:45:33,153 --> 00:45:35,197
Thank you, sir.

264
00:45:54,299 --> 00:46:01,431
My humblest apologies.
Forgive my ignorance.

265
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:07,312
I am recently arrived from abroad,
and I do not know your city.

266
00:46:07,479 --> 00:46:13,235
- As a beautiful lady...
- Purchase a street atlas. Good day.

267
00:46:14,402 --> 00:46:17,906
I have offended you.

268
00:46:18,073 --> 00:46:23,829
I'm looking for the cinematograph.
The wonder of the civilized world.

269
00:46:24,037 --> 00:46:31,419
If you seek culture, visit a museum.
London is filled with them.

270
00:46:39,803 --> 00:46:46,226
A woman so lovely and intelligent
should not be walking alone.

271
00:46:46,434 --> 00:46:49,688
Do I know you, sir?

272
00:46:49,896 --> 00:46:54,943
Are you acquainted with my husband?
Shall I call the police?

273
00:46:56,862 --> 00:47:03,160
Husband?
I shall bother you no more.

274
00:47:05,412 --> 00:47:07,831
Sir...

275
00:47:08,039 --> 00:47:13,628
It is I who have been rude.
If you're looking...

276
00:47:15,672 --> 00:47:19,968
Permit me to introduce myself.

277
00:47:20,177 --> 00:47:24,639
I am Prince Vlad of Sachait.

278
00:47:27,392 --> 00:47:33,648
- A prince, no less.
- I am your servant.

279
00:47:35,233 --> 00:47:38,069
Wilhelmina Murray.

280
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:48,163
I am honored, Madam Mina.

281
00:47:51,708 --> 00:47:55,128
This way.

282
00:48:08,767 --> 00:48:13,897
Mr. Holmwood asked me
to stop by to see Miss Lucy.

283
00:48:14,105 --> 00:48:16,775
Dr. Seward, Miss Lucy.

284
00:48:16,942 --> 00:48:21,822
Jack! Brilliant Jack!
Do you like it?

285
00:48:23,532 --> 00:48:30,330
Did Arthur put you up to this?
Or did you want me alone?

286
00:48:30,497 --> 00:48:37,963
Lucy, I'm here as your doctor.
Your fiancé is worried about you.

287
00:48:38,171 --> 00:48:45,136
A doctor's confidence is sacred.
I must have your complete trust.

288
00:48:49,933 --> 00:48:56,106
Help me, Jack. I don't know
what's happening to me.

289
00:48:56,314 --> 00:49:01,319
I'm changing. I can feel it.

290
00:49:01,528 --> 00:49:06,658
I can hear everything.
I can hear the servants whispering.

291
00:49:06,867 --> 00:49:11,163
I hear mice in the attic
stomping like elephants.

292
00:49:11,329 --> 00:49:17,711
But I'm having horrible nightmares.
The eyes...

293
00:49:17,919 --> 00:49:22,966
- Jack...
- I'm here. Nothing will harm you.

294
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:32,017
- Let it work.
- Thank you...

295
00:49:32,184 --> 00:49:35,604
Jack, kiss me.

296
00:49:39,399 --> 00:49:44,821
Lucy is hotter than a June bride
riding bareback in the Sahara.

297
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:48,366
Watch your colonial tongue.

298
00:49:48,575 --> 00:49:52,704
Hello, Jack.
How's our lovely patient today?

299
00:49:52,913 --> 00:49:59,336
- Frankly, I'm confounded.
- Jack, are you still brooding?

300
00:49:59,544 --> 00:50:06,259
- It must be something mental.
- How very droll. Did you hear that?

301
00:50:06,426 --> 00:50:10,805
Last week he wanted to marry her,
now he wants to have her committed.

302
00:50:11,014 --> 00:50:13,058
Let's have a look at her.

303
00:50:23,485 --> 00:50:26,571
I'm at a loss, I admit.

304
00:50:26,738 --> 00:50:31,535
I've cabled Abraham van Helsing,
the metaphysician-philosopher.

305
00:50:31,743 --> 00:50:38,458
- He sounds like a witch doctor.
- He studies obscure diseases.

306
00:50:38,625 --> 00:50:42,045
He's my teacher and mentor.

307
00:50:43,588 --> 00:50:50,053
Do it, man.
Bring him here. Spare no expense.

308
00:51:24,129 --> 00:51:30,051
Astounding.
There are no limits to science.

309
00:51:31,052 --> 00:51:34,639
How can you call this science?

310
00:51:34,806 --> 00:51:39,978
Do you think Madame Curie
would invite such comparisons?

311
00:51:42,481 --> 00:51:48,653
I shouldn't have come here.
I must go.

312
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,453
Do not fear me.

313
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:14,930
Stop this!

314
00:52:23,814 --> 00:52:28,610
My God, who are you?
I know you.

315
00:52:28,777 --> 00:52:35,325
I have crossed oceans of time
to find you.

316
00:53:40,432 --> 00:53:43,268
Come here, Mina.

317
00:54:01,661 --> 00:54:05,499
He likes you.

318
00:54:29,231 --> 00:54:33,693
There is much to be learned
from beasts.

319
00:55:45,724 --> 00:55:53,023
A vampire bat must consume ten times
its own weight in blood each day,

320
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:57,986
or its own blood cells will die.

321
00:56:04,451 --> 00:56:07,954
Cute little vermin.

322
00:56:08,163 --> 00:56:13,335
Blood, and diseases of the blood
such as syphilis concern us here.

323
00:56:13,543 --> 00:56:18,465
The very name venereal diseases,
the diseases of Venus,

324
00:56:18,673 --> 00:56:23,720
imputes to them divine origin.
They involve the sex problem,

325
00:56:23,929 --> 00:56:28,308
about which the ethics and ideals
of Christianity are concerned.

326
00:56:28,517 --> 00:56:35,106
Civilization and syphilization
have advanced together.

327
00:56:36,358 --> 00:56:40,821
- What is this?
- It's from the telegraph.

328
00:56:44,366 --> 00:56:49,162
Thank you.
Gentlemen, that will be all.

329
00:56:58,964 --> 00:57:03,593
Dawn. These may be the last words
I write in this journal.

330
00:57:03,802 --> 00:57:08,348
Dracula has left me with these
women, these devils of the pit.

331
00:57:08,557 --> 00:57:13,645
They drain my blood to keep
me weak, so I cannot escape.

332
00:57:13,854 --> 00:57:20,193
I will try one last time today
to find a passageway to the river.

333
00:57:20,402 --> 00:57:26,408
I must leave this cursed land
where the Devil's children walk.

334
00:57:36,334 --> 00:57:41,673
I do attest that at this point,
l, Abraham van Helsing,

335
00:57:41,882 --> 00:57:46,094
became personally involved
in these strange events.

336
00:58:39,856 --> 00:58:44,569
Professor van Helsing.
How good of you to come.

337
00:58:47,447 --> 00:58:53,453
I always come to a friend in need.
Tell me about your case.

338
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:59,793
She has the usual anemic signs.
Her blood is normal, yet it is not.

339
00:59:00,001 --> 00:59:05,340
- She manifests repeated blood loss.
- Blood loss? How?

340
00:59:15,433 --> 00:59:18,687
Close the doors!

341
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:33,076
My God, she is only a child.

342
00:59:35,829 --> 00:59:37,873
My God!

343
00:59:38,081 --> 00:59:42,794
She must have a transfusion at once.
Take off your jacket.

344
00:59:42,961 --> 00:59:47,340
- You know how to tie a tourniquet.
- You perfected a procedure.

345
00:59:47,549 --> 00:59:53,221
No, I only experimented.
Landsteiner's method.

346
00:59:53,388 --> 00:59:55,891
Animals, goats, sheep...

347
00:59:57,267 --> 01:00:01,396
If haemolysis occurs in the serum,
her red blood cells will explode,

348
01:00:01,605 --> 01:00:04,941
and she will die.
Take this tube.

349
01:00:07,652 --> 01:00:12,782
What in God's name is going on?
What are you doing to Lucy?

350
01:00:12,991 --> 01:00:18,121
- Trying to save her life!
- Are you the fiancé?

351
01:00:20,373 --> 01:00:25,795
Take off your coat. This young lady
needs blood and blood she must have.

352
01:00:26,004 --> 01:00:31,218
- Take off your coat.
- Roll up your sleeve, Arthur.

353
01:00:31,426 --> 01:00:34,846
- Quickly.
- Roll it up!

354
01:00:35,055 --> 01:00:38,225
This may hurt a little.

355
01:00:48,026 --> 01:00:53,073
Forgive me, sir. I would give
my last drop of blood to save her.

356
01:00:53,281 --> 01:01:00,497
Your last drop? Thank you,
I don't ask as much as that... yet.

357
01:01:00,664 --> 01:01:03,583
Hold her hand.

358
01:01:14,261 --> 01:01:18,723
Jack, that poor girl has had
the blood of two men put into her.

359
01:01:18,890 --> 01:01:23,603
Her whole body
couldn't hold that much blood.

360
01:01:25,313 --> 01:01:30,443
- What took it out?
- That's a good question.

361
01:01:34,156 --> 01:01:41,037
Those marks on her throat...
No disease, no trituration.

362
01:01:41,204 --> 01:01:44,291
The blood loss occurred there.

363
01:01:44,499 --> 01:01:50,922
You were once a careful student.
Where did the blood go? Tell me.

364
01:01:51,131 --> 01:01:58,805
- The bed clothes showed no blood.
- Believe what your senses tell you.

365
01:01:59,014 --> 01:02:04,436
Something went up there
sucked it out of her and flew away?

366
01:02:04,644 --> 01:02:10,567
- Yeah, why not?
- Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant!

367
01:02:10,775 --> 01:02:16,531
Will one of you learned doctors
kindly tell me what is going on?

368
01:02:16,698 --> 01:02:19,534
Jack, you are a scientist.

369
01:02:19,743 --> 01:02:24,456
Do you not think there are things
you cannot understand?

370
01:02:24,664 --> 01:02:31,087
Mesmerism, hypnotism,
materialization...

371
01:02:38,637 --> 01:02:43,517
- Professor?
- Where the hell did he go?

372
01:02:46,686 --> 01:02:51,149
- You see?
- I feel like a blundering novice.

373
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:54,945
We're not fighting
some disease here.

374
01:02:55,153 --> 01:02:59,282
There is something
unspeakable out there.

375
01:02:59,449 --> 01:03:03,912
Dead but not dead.
It stalks us with some purpose.

376
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:09,709
To live, it feeds on Lucy's blood.
It is a beast. A monster.

377
01:03:28,228 --> 01:03:31,565
What is happening
to Lucy and to me?

378
01:03:31,731 --> 01:03:36,945
My feelings are so troubled.
I wish I were myself again.

379
01:03:37,154 --> 01:03:41,074
The sensible Mina
I always depended on.

380
01:03:47,414 --> 01:03:53,170
Absinthe...
is the aphrodisiac of the self.

381
01:03:54,254 --> 01:04:00,427
The green fairy
who lives in the absinthe...

382
01:04:01,511 --> 01:04:05,015
... wants your soul.

383
01:04:06,308 --> 01:04:12,230
But you are safe with me.

384
01:04:26,745 --> 01:04:31,458
Tell me, Prince...
Tell me of your home.

385
01:04:33,919 --> 01:04:39,174
The most beautiful place
in all creation.

386
01:04:39,382 --> 01:04:43,512
It must be.

387
01:04:47,057 --> 01:04:53,146
A land beyond a great vast forest.

388
01:04:53,313 --> 01:04:57,776
Surrounded by majestic mountains.

389
01:04:57,984 --> 01:05:01,238
Lush vineyards.

390
01:05:01,947 --> 01:05:10,038
Flowers of such frailty and beauty
as to be found nowhere else.

391
01:05:18,713 --> 01:05:25,595
You describe my home
as if you had seen it first-hand.

392
01:05:27,138 --> 01:05:33,603
It's your voice, perhaps.
It's so familiar.

393
01:05:34,563 --> 01:05:42,195
It's like...
a voice in a dream I cannot place.

394
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:49,703
It comforts me when I am alone.

395
01:06:10,515 --> 01:06:14,352
And what of the princess?

396
01:06:19,357 --> 01:06:24,571
- Princess?
- There is always a princess.

397
01:06:24,779 --> 01:06:28,492
With gowns flowing white.

398
01:06:33,205 --> 01:06:37,334
Her face...

399
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:41,796
Her face...

400
01:06:43,965 --> 01:06:47,135
...is a river.

401
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:55,101
The princess... is a river.

402
01:06:55,268 --> 01:07:02,651
Filled with tears
of sadness and heartbreak.

403
01:07:04,736 --> 01:07:08,490
There was a princess.

404
01:07:10,367 --> 01:07:13,620
Elizabetha.

405
01:07:14,955 --> 01:07:21,545
She was the most radiant woman
in all the empires of the world.

406
01:07:26,716 --> 01:07:32,222
Man's deceit took her
from her ancient prince.

407
01:07:32,389 --> 01:07:38,728
She leapt to her death
into the river that you spoke of.

408
01:07:38,937 --> 01:07:45,360
In my mother tongue it is called:

409
01:07:50,657 --> 01:07:54,619
River Princess.

410
01:09:28,964 --> 01:09:36,346
Dear madam, your fiancé is safe
with the Sisters of the Sacrament.

411
01:09:37,389 --> 01:09:41,685
Mr. Harker believes your life
is in extreme danger.

412
01:09:41,893 --> 01:09:48,692
He desires that you join him here
so that you may be married.

413
01:09:48,859 --> 01:09:53,572
Yours with all blessings,
Sister Agatha.

414
01:09:55,490 --> 01:10:01,955
My sweet Prince...
Jonathan must never know of us.

415
01:10:08,211 --> 01:10:12,924
- Lucy...
- Abraham van Helsing.

416
01:10:13,091 --> 01:10:17,637
- You must be Madam Mina.
- How is she, Doctor?

417
01:10:17,804 --> 01:10:24,519
She is still weak. She tells me of
your worry for your beloved fiancé.

418
01:10:24,686 --> 01:10:29,774
I, too, worry for all young lovers.

419
01:10:31,443 --> 01:10:36,072
There are darkness’s in life,
my child, and there are lights.

420
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:42,245
You are one of the lights, Mina.
The light of all light.

421
01:10:46,625 --> 01:10:50,837
Go now, see your friend.

422
01:11:04,726 --> 01:11:07,646
Mina...

423
01:11:09,606 --> 01:11:15,612
You look different, Mina.
You look positively radiant.

424
01:11:15,779 --> 01:11:20,492
- You heard from Jonathan.
- Yes!

425
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:26,122
He's safe, Lucy.
He's in a convent in Romania.

426
01:11:26,289 --> 01:11:29,543
He's suffering
from a violent brain fever.

427
01:11:29,751 --> 01:11:36,174
The good sisters caring for him
say he needs me.

428
01:11:36,383 --> 01:11:41,388
But I won't go...
I'm not going to leave you.

429
01:11:41,638 --> 01:11:46,518
Mina, you've got to go to him.

430
01:11:46,685 --> 01:11:52,691
You've got to love him.
Marry him then and there.

431
01:11:52,899 --> 01:11:58,655
I want you to take this, my sister.
It's my wedding gift to you.

432
01:11:58,822 --> 01:12:05,203
- No, Lucy...
- Don't worry about me.

433
01:12:05,412 --> 01:12:07,956
I'll be all right.

434
01:12:08,165 --> 01:12:13,170
Tell Jonathan oceans of love.

435
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:30,061
Jack, how is she?

436
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:54,169
- This is why I cannot breathe!
- It's medicinal.

437
01:12:54,377 --> 01:13:01,092
- It's nothing but common garlic!
- Quincy has come to see you.

438
01:13:01,301 --> 01:13:06,556
Miss Lucy, you just rest easy.
Arthur sent me to take care of you.

439
01:13:07,766 --> 01:13:12,312
If you don't get better, I'll have
to put you out of your misery.

440
01:13:12,479 --> 01:13:17,609
Quincy, you're such a beast.

441
01:13:21,112 --> 01:13:24,699
Kiss me, Quincy.

442
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:28,453
Kiss me.

443
01:13:30,747 --> 01:13:33,416
Kiss me!

444
01:13:35,836 --> 01:13:39,965
- That old coot!
- Get off me!

445
01:13:40,173 --> 01:13:43,802
Lucy, listen to me. Sleep now.

446
01:13:48,515 --> 01:13:52,561
Look there and there.

447
01:13:56,273 --> 01:13:59,693
Nosferatu.

448
01:14:11,454 --> 01:14:17,794
"Here follows the shocking history
of the berserk Prince Dracula".

449
01:14:18,003 --> 01:14:22,132
"He impaled people and roasted them,
and boiled their heads".

450
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:29,055
"He skinned them alive, hacked them
to pieces and drank their blood".

451
01:14:30,182 --> 01:14:35,103
Dracul.

452
01:14:35,312 --> 01:14:38,398
Her blood is the life.

453
01:14:52,579 --> 01:14:56,708
My dearest Prince, forgive me.

454
01:14:56,875 --> 01:15:02,797
I have received word from my fiancé
in Romania. I am to join him.

455
01:15:03,006 --> 01:15:07,636
We are to be married.
I will never see you again.

456
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:10,013
Mina.

457
01:15:18,939 --> 01:15:24,152
It is odd, but I feel almost
that my strange friend is with me.

458
01:15:24,361 --> 01:15:30,534
He speaks to me in my thoughts.
With him I felt alive.

459
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:36,456
Without him, soon to be a bride,
I feel confused and lost.

460
01:15:36,665 --> 01:15:44,756
Perhaps, though I try to be good,
I am a bad, inconstant woman.

461
01:16:02,065 --> 01:16:07,571
Winds! Winds!

462
01:16:08,697 --> 01:16:11,616
Winds!

463
01:16:14,661 --> 01:16:20,250
It is the cause.

464
01:16:20,458 --> 01:16:23,628
It is Dracula, the undead.

465
01:16:23,837 --> 01:16:27,716
The foe I have pursued all my life!

466
01:16:35,307 --> 01:16:40,228
Jack, hurry.
I have much to tell you.

467
01:16:40,437 --> 01:16:44,983
Guard her well, Mr. Morris.
Do not fail here tonight.

468
01:16:45,150 --> 01:16:49,696
We are dealing with forces
of enormous power.

469
01:16:49,905 --> 01:16:54,117
Guard her well, or your Lucy
will become a bitch of the Devil.

470
01:16:54,326 --> 01:16:56,745
A whore of darkness!

471
01:16:58,205 --> 01:17:01,374
You're a sick old buzzard!

472
01:17:01,583 --> 01:17:07,172
Hear me out. Lucy is not a random
victim, attacked by mere accident.

473
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:14,095
She is a willing recruit,
I dare say a devoted disciple.

474
01:17:14,304 --> 01:17:20,143
She is the Devil's concubine!
Do you understand me?

475
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:25,190
Yet we may still save her soul.

476
01:17:25,398 --> 01:17:30,737
But not on an empty stomach.

477
01:17:30,904 --> 01:17:36,660
- Jack, I starve. Feed me!
- You old coot!

478
01:19:51,586 --> 01:19:55,090
Your impotent men
with their foolish spells

479
01:19:55,257 --> 01:19:59,094
cannot protect you
from my power.

480
01:20:11,690 --> 01:20:15,026
I condemn you to living death.

481
01:20:15,193 --> 01:20:22,659
To eternal hunger for living blood.

482
01:21:47,077 --> 01:21:50,163
Jack.

483
01:21:56,002 --> 01:22:02,384
I know how deeply you loved her.
That is why you must trust me.

484
01:22:02,592 --> 01:22:08,431
- I need some post-mortem knives.
- An autopsy? Lucy?

485
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:14,229
No, I just want to cut off her head
and take out her heart.

486
01:22:19,901 --> 01:22:24,781
Diary, 17th September.
Poor Jonathan.

487
01:22:24,948 --> 01:22:30,287
He's still so ill, but cheered
by the familiar streets of London.

488
01:22:30,495 --> 01:22:35,500
For me, now that Lucy is dead,
it is a sad homecoming.

489
01:22:35,709 --> 01:22:41,047
A part of me is dead, too,
except for the tiny hope

490
01:22:41,256 --> 01:22:45,969
that I will again see my prince.
Is he here?

491
01:22:46,178 --> 01:22:51,683
Now that I am married, I understand
the feeling that I have for him.

492
01:22:51,892 --> 01:22:55,145
He is always in my thoughts.

493
01:23:05,572 --> 01:23:09,701
- Jonathan, what is it?
- It is the man himself!

494
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:13,330
Look, he has grown young!

495
01:23:55,372 --> 01:23:57,666
Gentlemen...

496
01:23:57,874 --> 01:24:03,213
Must we desecrate poor Lucy's grave?
She died horribly enough.

497
01:24:04,381 --> 01:24:10,554
If Miss Lucy's dead, no wrong can
be done, but if she's not dead...

498
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:16,393
- Has she been buried alive?
- No...

499
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:22,399
- She is undead. Undead.
- This is insane.

500
01:24:41,459 --> 01:24:47,382
Gentlemen, shall we?
One, two, three...

501
01:25:03,607 --> 01:25:06,776
Where is she?

502
01:25:06,943 --> 01:25:13,325
Where is she?
What have you done with her?

503
01:25:13,533 --> 01:25:17,579
She lives beyond the grace of God.
A wanderer in the outer darkness.

504
01:25:17,746 --> 01:25:21,541
She is vampire, nosferatu.

505
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:25,170
These creatures do not die,

506
01:25:25,378 --> 01:25:31,676
but grow strong and immortal
once infected by another nosferatu.

507
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:41,353
We fight not one beast,
but the legions of the ages,

508
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:44,856
feeding on the blood
of the living.

509
01:25:49,569 --> 01:25:52,572
Quickly, hide!

510
01:26:20,892 --> 01:26:23,436
Lucy!

511
01:26:29,526 --> 01:26:35,866
Come to me, Arthur.
Leave these others and come to me.

512
01:26:37,659 --> 01:26:40,996
My arms are hungry for you, darling.

513
01:26:41,913 --> 01:26:47,043
Kiss me and caress me,
my darling husband.

514
01:26:47,252 --> 01:26:52,674
We are strong in the Lord
and the power of his might!

515
01:26:52,883 --> 01:26:56,136
We are strong in the Lord
and the power of his might.

516
01:26:57,387 --> 01:27:03,560
We are strong in the Lord
and the power of his might.

517
01:27:05,437 --> 01:27:09,733
We are strong in the Lord
and the power of his might.

518
01:27:11,234 --> 01:27:13,904
I bring you from shadow into light.

519
01:27:14,070 --> 01:27:20,160
I cast you out,
the Prince of Darkness!

520
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:27,209
A moment's courage and it is done.
Take the stake in your left hand.

521
01:27:28,084 --> 01:27:30,754
Place the point over the heart.

522
01:27:35,008 --> 01:27:38,178
Then, in God's name, strike. Now!

523
01:27:52,859 --> 01:27:58,949
Eat! You will need your strength
for the dark days ahead.

524
01:28:00,742 --> 01:28:05,205
Doctor, how did Lucy die?

525
01:28:10,919 --> 01:28:12,963
In pain?

526
01:28:13,171 --> 01:28:18,510
Yes, until we cut off her head
and drove a stake through her heart.

527
01:28:18,718 --> 01:28:22,389
- Then she found peace.
- Doctor, please!

528
01:28:26,059 --> 01:28:32,357
Mr. Harker, I must now ask you,
as your doctor,

529
01:28:34,276 --> 01:28:40,115
a sensitive question. During your
infidelity with the demonic women,

530
01:28:40,323 --> 01:28:45,912
did you for one instant
taste of their blood?

531
01:28:50,125 --> 01:28:54,045
- No?
- No.

532
01:28:55,338 --> 01:29:02,637
Good. Then you have not infected
your blood like poor Lucy.

533
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:14,274
Doctor, you must understand...

534
01:29:14,483 --> 01:29:18,862
I doubted everything, even my mind.

535
01:29:19,029 --> 01:29:23,992
- I was impotent with fear.
- I know.

536
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:31,875
I know where the bastard sleeps...
Carfax Abbey.

537
01:29:34,503 --> 01:29:38,215
Vampires do exist.

538
01:29:38,423 --> 01:29:43,553
This one we face has the strength
of 20 or more people.

539
01:29:43,762 --> 01:29:46,264
You can testify for that.

540
01:29:46,473 --> 01:29:51,561
He can also control the meaner
things of life. The bat, the wolf.

541
01:29:51,770 --> 01:29:56,066
He can appear as mist or fog
and vanish at will.

542
01:29:56,233 --> 01:30:00,195
All these things he can do,
but he is not free.

543
01:30:00,403 --> 01:30:07,953
He has to rest in the earth of his
homeland to gain his evil power.

544
01:30:08,119 --> 01:30:13,458
- I feel pity for one so hunted.
- How can you pity such a creature?

545
01:30:15,293 --> 01:30:20,882
- Mina, come to my quarters.
- You'll be safer there.

546
01:30:22,175 --> 01:30:27,848
Bullets will not harm him,
I suggest you use your bowie knife.

547
01:30:28,056 --> 01:30:33,311
I wasn't planning
on getting that close.

548
01:30:35,188 --> 01:30:39,818
Master!

549
01:30:50,370 --> 01:30:56,960
Dr. Jack,
I've been promised eternal life!

550
01:30:58,128 --> 01:31:03,341
- Who is that man?
- Mr. Renfield. Come with me.

551
01:31:03,550 --> 01:31:07,846
Renfield... I must see him.

552
01:31:08,013 --> 01:31:12,476
Mr. Renfield, behave yourself.

553
01:31:13,643 --> 01:31:17,147
This is Mrs. Harker.

554
01:31:17,314 --> 01:31:21,193
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mr. Renfield.

555
01:31:21,401 --> 01:31:25,238
It seems I've been rather naughty.

556
01:31:26,490 --> 01:31:30,243
I know you.
You're the bride my master covets.

557
01:31:32,370 --> 01:31:37,250
I have a husband.
I am Mrs. Harker.

558
01:31:38,460 --> 01:31:44,049
- My master tells me about you.
- What does he tell you?

559
01:31:44,257 --> 01:31:50,430
That he is coming...
That he is coming for you.

560
01:31:52,724 --> 01:31:55,894
Please...

561
01:31:59,356 --> 01:32:06,571
Don't stay here.
Get away from this man, please.

562
01:32:07,739 --> 01:32:13,662
I pray to God I may never see
your sweet face again.

563
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:20,919
May the Lord bless and keep you.

564
01:32:29,636 --> 01:32:35,892
Master!
You promised me eternal life,

565
01:32:36,101 --> 01:32:41,523
but you give it
to the pretty woman. Dr. Jack!

566
01:32:41,731 --> 01:32:46,820
I'm no lunatic, man.
I'm a man fighting for his soul.

567
01:32:47,028 --> 01:32:51,158
My quarters are spare,
but comfortable.

568
01:32:52,617 --> 01:32:56,580
Water and toiletries
at your disposal.

569
01:32:56,788 --> 01:32:59,875
You'll be completely safe here.

570
01:34:02,604 --> 01:34:08,276
Destroy every box.
Sterilize the earth inside.

571
01:34:08,443 --> 01:34:11,863
Let the exorcism begin.

572
01:34:37,639 --> 01:34:43,937
Renfield... you have betrayed me.

573
01:34:47,107 --> 01:34:50,193
No, Master.

574
01:34:53,321 --> 01:34:59,828
I serve you.
I serve only you.

575
01:35:56,635 --> 01:36:02,724
Yes, my love, you have found me.

576
01:36:04,976 --> 01:36:07,813
My most precious life.

577
01:36:08,021 --> 01:36:14,110
I've wanted this to happen.
I know that now.

578
01:36:14,319 --> 01:36:22,828
- I want to be with you always.
- You know not what you are saying.

579
01:36:23,036 --> 01:36:27,916
Yes, I do know.

580
01:36:40,262 --> 01:36:44,391
I feared I would never
feel your touch again.

581
01:36:44,599 --> 01:36:47,936
I thought you were dead.

582
01:36:53,441 --> 01:36:59,030
There is no life in this body.

583
01:37:01,575 --> 01:37:05,078
But you live.

584
01:37:05,245 --> 01:37:08,582
You live.

585
01:37:08,790 --> 01:37:15,672
What are you? I must know.
You must tell me.

586
01:37:22,637 --> 01:37:28,226
I am... nothing.

587
01:37:28,393 --> 01:37:31,563
Lifeless.

588
01:37:31,730 --> 01:37:37,819
Soulless. Hated and feared.

589
01:37:38,028 --> 01:37:43,450
I am dead to all the world.
Hear me.

590
01:37:44,868 --> 01:37:50,707
I am the monster
that breathing men would kill.

591
01:37:50,916 --> 01:37:54,836
I am Dracula.

592
01:38:09,017 --> 01:38:12,771
You murdered Lucy!

593
01:38:24,825 --> 01:38:28,328
I love you.

594
01:38:28,537 --> 01:38:32,123
God forgive me, I do!

595
01:38:50,809 --> 01:38:58,191
I want to be what you are. See
what you see. Love what you love.

596
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:03,029
To walk with me,

597
01:39:03,196 --> 01:39:09,744
you must die from this life
and be reborn to mine.

598
01:39:09,953 --> 01:39:17,085
You are my love and my life always.

599
01:39:23,717 --> 01:39:29,306
Then I give you life eternal.

600
01:39:30,056 --> 01:39:33,560
Everlasting love.

601
01:39:33,768 --> 01:39:40,275
The power of the storm
and the beasts of the earth.

602
01:39:41,443 --> 01:39:47,616
Walk with me
to be my loving wife forever.

603
01:39:47,824 --> 01:39:50,243
I will! Yes!

604
01:40:18,980 --> 01:40:24,236
Mina, drink and join me

605
01:40:24,444 --> 01:40:27,864
in eternal life.

606
01:40:41,253 --> 01:40:45,966
I cannot let this be!

607
01:40:46,174 --> 01:40:49,678
Please, I don't care.

608
01:40:49,845 --> 01:40:55,600
You will be cursed to walk in the
shadow of death for all eternity.

609
01:40:55,809 --> 01:41:02,065
I love you too much
to condemn you.

610
01:41:03,275 --> 01:41:07,320
Take me away from all this death.

611
01:41:53,366 --> 01:41:56,286
Mina!

612
01:42:04,961 --> 01:42:11,510
You think you can destroy me
with your idols!

613
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:19,309
- Sacred blood of Christ!
- I served the cross.

614
01:42:19,518 --> 01:42:25,106
I commanded nations, hundreds
of years before you were born.

615
01:42:25,315 --> 01:42:31,071
Your armies were defeated.
You tortured thousands of people.

616
01:42:31,238 --> 01:42:34,741
I was betrayed.

617
01:42:34,908 --> 01:42:40,330
Look what your God has done to me.

618
01:42:40,539 --> 01:42:45,794
Your war with God is over!
You must pay for your crimes.

619
01:42:49,047 --> 01:42:56,888
- Christ compels you.
- She is now... my bride!

620
01:43:05,397 --> 01:43:08,483
Light! More light!

621
01:43:16,491 --> 01:43:20,620
Unclean... Unclean.

622
01:43:20,829 --> 01:43:24,332
- Get them!
- They must be burnt.

623
01:43:24,499 --> 01:43:30,672
We know that Dracula fears us.
He fears time.

624
01:43:30,839 --> 01:43:34,176
If not, why does he hurry so?

625
01:43:34,384 --> 01:43:39,264
- He is gone.
- How do you know?

626
01:43:39,473 --> 01:43:43,185
He speaks to me.

627
01:43:43,393 --> 01:43:47,939
He has a strong
mind-connection to you.

628
01:43:48,106 --> 01:43:52,319
His heart was strong enough
to survive the grave.

629
01:43:52,527 --> 01:43:55,363
You admire him.

630
01:43:55,572 --> 01:44:02,871
Yes, he was in life
a most remarkable man. A great man.

631
01:44:03,079 --> 01:44:08,919
But greater is the necessity
to stamp him out and destroy him.

632
01:44:09,085 --> 01:44:12,172
Doctor...

633
01:44:13,965 --> 01:44:17,594
I know that I am becoming like him.

634
01:44:17,803 --> 01:44:25,018
Your salvation is his destruction.
That is why I want to hypnotize you.

635
01:44:25,185 --> 01:44:32,567
I want you to help me find him.
Please, help me find him.

636
01:44:32,776 --> 01:44:38,198
Look into this light. The light
of all light. Into this flame.

637
01:44:39,282 --> 01:44:46,164
Your eyes are heavy.
You want to sleep. Sleep now.

638
01:44:48,542 --> 01:44:50,794
Sleep...

639
01:44:51,002 --> 01:44:56,508
- I must go to him. He calls.
- What do you hear?

640
01:44:58,802 --> 01:45:03,723
What do you hear, child?

641
01:45:06,476 --> 01:45:13,275
My prince calls me. He is traveling
across icy seas to his home.

642
01:45:13,441 --> 01:45:17,237
There he will grow strong again.

643
01:45:17,445 --> 01:45:22,325
I am coming to him
to partake of his strength.

644
01:45:26,830 --> 01:45:31,543
We left London by train and
crossed the channel in stormy seas.

645
01:45:31,751 --> 01:45:34,838
No doubt the Count's doing.

646
01:45:35,046 --> 01:45:39,593
He commands the winds,
but we have the advantage.

647
01:45:39,759 --> 01:45:46,099
We can reach the port at Varna
days before his ship arrives.

648
01:45:47,350 --> 01:45:50,437
From Paris we travel to Budapest.

649
01:45:50,645 --> 01:45:55,275
The Count must sail past Gibraltar,
where we have posted a lookout.

650
01:45:55,484 --> 01:46:01,573
When we reach Varna, we'll wait for
his ship and burn it into the sea.

651
01:46:07,704 --> 01:46:11,750
Home... home.

652
01:46:20,592 --> 01:46:25,514
The vampire baptized her with
his own blood. Her blood is dying.

653
01:46:25,722 --> 01:46:29,226
It is no use.

654
01:46:40,237 --> 01:46:45,033
We'll not let you go
into the unknown alone.

655
01:46:45,242 --> 01:46:52,124
Poor Jonathan,
what have I done to you?

656
01:46:52,290 --> 01:46:55,877
No, I have done this to both of us.

657
01:46:56,086 --> 01:47:01,424
I can hear him coming closer.
He's calling me to him.

658
01:47:04,386 --> 01:47:10,058
- Stay with me, please.
- I'm so cold.

659
01:47:22,737 --> 01:47:27,033
Noon. Holmwood received a wire
from his clerk.

660
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:31,997
The Count's ship sailed past us
to the northern port of Galatz.

661
01:47:32,205 --> 01:47:35,375
The black devil
is reading Mina's mind.

662
01:47:35,584 --> 01:47:39,004
How can we catch him now?

663
01:47:45,677 --> 01:47:50,307
Varna... Galatz.
It's about 200 miles.

664
01:47:50,474 --> 01:47:57,772
With the horses we can cut him off.
Van Helsing takes the Borgo Pass.

665
01:47:57,981 --> 01:48:02,903
If we fail in our task,
you will have to finish him.

666
01:48:06,239 --> 01:48:09,993
From Varna, Mina and van Helsing
took a carriage.

667
01:48:10,202 --> 01:48:16,124
We continued on to Galatz
in order to intercept the Count.

668
01:48:16,333 --> 01:48:21,129
I am fearful for Mina.
She is now our decoy.

669
01:48:33,433 --> 01:48:40,148
- I know this place. We must go on.
- It is late, we must rest here now.

670
01:48:40,315 --> 01:48:44,694
No! We must go.
He needs me!

671
01:48:49,282 --> 01:48:53,912
We are passed Bistrita.
Dracula outsmarted us again.

672
01:48:54,120 --> 01:49:01,253
His gypsies met him at Galatz
and are now on the Borgo Pass.

673
01:49:17,269 --> 01:49:20,856
- You must eat.
- I am not hungry.

674
01:49:24,442 --> 01:49:27,863
Mina!

675
01:50:13,116 --> 01:50:17,746
You have been so good to me,
Professor.

676
01:50:25,629 --> 01:50:32,177
I know that Lucy had secret desires
for you. She told me.

677
01:50:32,385 --> 01:50:36,848
I, too, know what men desire.

678
01:50:52,155 --> 01:50:56,284
Will you cut off my head and
drive a stake through my heart,

679
01:50:56,493 --> 01:51:02,332
as you did poor Lucy,
you murdering bastard?

680
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:10,048
Not while I live.
I've sworn to protect you.

681
01:51:24,187 --> 01:51:29,860
You're safe within the circle.
I'll not lose you to him.

682
01:51:30,026 --> 01:51:33,655
Whores of Satan!

683
01:51:35,740 --> 01:51:39,578
This is holy ground!
Leave this place now!

684
01:51:41,121 --> 01:51:43,540
Leave!

685
01:51:44,458 --> 01:51:49,880
In the name of God, leave here!
I command you in the name of Christ.

686
01:52:01,183 --> 01:52:04,686
Damn you!

687
01:52:41,264 --> 01:52:44,601
Dracul!

688
01:52:45,435 --> 01:52:49,648
Dracul!

689
01:53:19,719 --> 01:53:25,976
Mina, you are near.

690
01:53:26,184 --> 01:53:29,354
My love.

691
01:53:40,657 --> 01:53:45,370
They're racing against the sunset.
It may be too late.

692
01:54:16,485 --> 01:54:19,404
Mina!

693
01:54:26,161 --> 01:54:29,080
Shoot!

694
01:54:35,754 --> 01:54:38,840
Charge!

695
01:57:00,982 --> 01:57:03,235
Quincy!

696
01:57:06,321 --> 01:57:08,448
No!

697
01:57:12,244 --> 01:57:15,497
No.

698
01:57:19,209 --> 01:57:23,922
When my time comes,
will you do the same to me?

699
01:57:25,090 --> 01:57:28,093
Will you?

700
01:57:29,845 --> 01:57:32,305
No.

701
01:57:32,514 --> 01:57:37,936
No, let them go.
Our work is finished here...

702
01:57:38,145 --> 01:57:41,815
Hers is just begun.

703
01:57:51,491 --> 01:57:54,077
Quincy.

704
01:58:04,129 --> 01:58:09,634
We have all become God's madmen.

705
01:58:09,801 --> 01:58:13,138
All of us.

706
01:58:20,979 --> 01:58:24,733
Where is my God?

707
01:58:24,941 --> 01:58:29,154
He has forsaken me.

708
01:58:34,159 --> 01:58:37,496
It is finished.

709
01:58:38,872 --> 01:58:42,709
My love.

710
01:58:46,171 --> 01:58:50,217
My love.

711
01:58:55,472 --> 01:58:59,601
There, in the presence of God,
I understood at last

712
01:58:59,810 --> 01:59:05,065
how my love could release us all
from the powers of darkness.

713
01:59:09,653 --> 01:59:14,991
Our love is stronger than death.

714
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:25,293
Give me peace.
