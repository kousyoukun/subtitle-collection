<i>The year, 1462.</i>
<i>Constantinople had fallen.</i>

2
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:54,480
<i>Moslem Turks swept into Europe,</i>
<i>threatening all of Christendom.</i>

3
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,952
<i>From Transylvania arose</i>
<i>a Romanian knight.</i>

4
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,470
<i>Draculea.</i>

5
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:24,672
<i>On the eve of the battle,</i>
<i>his bride, Elizabetha, -</i>

6
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,879
- <i>knew that he must face</i>
<i>an insurmountable force-</i>

7
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,955
- <i>from which he might never return.</i>

8
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,871
Elizabetha...

9
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,110
<i>The vengeful Turks</i>
<i>shot a message into the castle.</i>

10
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,748
<i>It told of Draculea's death.</i>

11
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,552
<i>Elizabetha, believing him dead,</i>
<i>flung herself into the river.</i>

12
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:39,837
<i>My prince is dead.</i>
<i>All is lost without him.</i>

13
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,788
<i>May God unite us in heaven.</i>

14
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,916
I've done everything
you asked, Master.

15
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,915
All the preparations are in order.
Everything.

16
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,437
I await your command, for I know-

17
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,559
- that when the rewards are given,-

18
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,840
- I will be one of those
who benefits from your generosity.

19
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,675
Thank you.

20
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,479
Renfield is deranged.

21
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,790
He's lost his mind, poor chap.
Take over his foreign client,-

22
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,192
- this eccentric Count Dracula.
He's buying up property in London.

23
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,035
Of course, sir.
Thank you for your confidence.

24
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:44,116
This is a great opportunity, Harker.
Leave for Transylvania immediately.

25
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:50,196
Opportunities such as this
come but once in a lifetime.

26
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,718
May I enquire, what happened
to Mr. Renfield in Transylvania?

27
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,589
Nothing... Personal problems.

28
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,709
Close these transactions, and your
future with this firm is assured.

29
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,032
Yes, sir.
I will give it my full attention.

30
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,918
We've waited this long...

31
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,438
- We can be married when I return.
- Of course.

32
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:25,948
- I will write.
- Jonathan...

33
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,749
- Jonathan, I love you.
- I love you, Mina.

<i>25th May, Budapest.</i>
<i>Left Budapest early this morning.</i>

35
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,552
<i>We're leaving the West...</i>

36
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,711
<i>We're traveling to the far east</i>
<i>of the country.</i>

37
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,112
<i>To the border of Transylvania,</i>
<i>Moldavia and Bukovina-</i>

38
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,957
- <i>in the Carpathian mountains.</i>
<i>One of the wildest areas of Europe.</i>

39
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,792
<i>My friend,</i>
<i>welcome to the Carpathians.</i>

40
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,191
<i>I am anxiously expecting you.</i>

41
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,718
<i>At the Borgo Pass,</i>
<i>my carriage will await you.</i>

42
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,556
<i>I trust your journey from London</i>
<i>has been a happy one.</i>

43
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,477
<i>And I hope you will enjoy your stay</i>
<i>in my beautiful land.</i>

44
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,031
<i>Your friend... D.</i>

45
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,435
<i>Diary, 25th May. My dear Jonathan</i>
<i>has been gone almost a week.</i>

46
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,149
<i>I wish we'd married</i>
<i>before his departure, -</i>

47
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:21,190
- <i>but I am happy he was sent</i>
<i>on this important mission.</i>

48
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,239
<i>It must be so nice</i>
<i>to see strange countries.</i>

49
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:31,430
<i>I wonder if Jonathan and I</i>
<i>shall ever see them together.</i>

50
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,034
We're early, driver.
No one is here.

51
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,272
I say, is the castle far?

52
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,790
Welcome to my home.

53
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,909
Enter of your own will and leave
some of the happiness you bring.

54
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,712
- Count Dracula?
- I am Dracula.

55
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,590
And I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker,
to my house.

56
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,552
Come in.

57
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:05,951
You will, I trust, excuse me
that I do not join you.

58
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:14,358
I have already dined
and I never drink...

59
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,356
...wine.

60
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:28,109
An ancestor?
I see a resemblance.

61
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,592
The order of the Dracul...

62
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,479
...is a dragon.

63
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:41,476
An ancient society
pledging my forefathers-

64
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:47,237
- to defend the church
against all enemies of Christ.

65
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,675
That relationship
was not entirely... successful.

66
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,434
Oh, yes...

67
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,439
It is no laughing matter!

68
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,754
We Draculs have a right to be proud.

69
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:17,951
No devil was greater than Attila,
whose blood flows in these veins.

70
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,194
Blood...

71
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:33,118
...is too precious a thing
in these times.

72
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,878
The warlike days are over.

73
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:47,399
The victories of my great race
are but a tale to be told.

74
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,794
I am the last of my kind.

75
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:02,716
I have offended you
with my ignorance. Forgive me.

76
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,752
I long to go through the crowded
streets of your mighty London.

77
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,471
To be in the midst of the whirl
and the rush of humanity.

78
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:29,919
To share its life, its changes...
its death.

79
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,993
There. You, Count...

80
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,475
...are the owner of Carfax Abbey.
Congratulations.

81
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,758
Your firm writes most highly
of your talents.

82
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:50,677
They say
you are a man of good... taste.

83
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:59,116
And that you are a worthy substitute
to your predecessor, Mr. Renfield.

84
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,999
You may rely on me.

85
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,836
I'm curious. Why ten houses
in such precise locations?

86
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,357
Is it to raise the market value?

87
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,075
Do you believe in destiny?

88
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,310
That even the powers of time-

89
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,759
- can be altered
for a single purpose?

90
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:42,358
The luckiest man on earth
is the one who finds... true love.

91
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:47,469
You found Mina.
I thought she was lost.

92
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:54,079
We're to be married when I return.
Are you married, Count?

93
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,710
Sir, are you married?

94
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,190
I was married once.

95
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,559
Ages ago, it seems.
She died.

96
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,113
- I'm very sorry.
- She was fortunate.

97
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,990
My life, at its best, is misery.

98
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,718
She will, no doubt,
make a devoted wife...

99
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,555
...and you a faithful husband.

100
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:39,152
Come, write to your firm
and any loved ones.

101
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:45,589
Say that it should please you
to stay with me for a month.

102
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,750
A month?
Do you wish me to stay so long?

103
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,194
I will take no refusal.

104
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,997
<i>Diary. 30th May, 1897.</i>

105
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,153
<i>Jonathan does not want me</i>
<i>to stay with Lucy while he is away.</i>

106
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,871
<i>If I become accustomed to the</i>
<i>privileges of the Weston family, -</i>

107
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,079
- <i>he thinks I will not be content</i>
<i>as the wife of a mere clerk.</i>

108
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,913
<i>But Lucy and I are friends.</i>

109
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,029
<i>She has never minded</i>
<i>that I am only a schoolmistress.</i>

110
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,031
Disgusting!

111
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,475
Mina...

112
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,759
Mina, you're always working.

113
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:01,199
Is your ambitious John Harker
forcing you to learn that machine?

114
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:07,879
He could be forcing you into acts
of passion on the parlor floor.

115
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:12,716
Lucy! You shouldn't talk about
my fiancé in such a way.

116
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,190
There's more to marriage
than carnal pleasures.

117
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:21,912
So I see... much, much more!

118
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:33,229
What is it, Lucy?
I don't understand it.

119
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,871
Can man and woman
really do... that?

120
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:42,079
- I did... only last night.
- Fibber! You did not.

121
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,439
Yes, I did. Well, in my dreams.

122
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:53,038
Jonathan measures up, doesn't he?
You can tell Lucy.

123
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,634
We've kissed, that's all.

124
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,793
He thinks he's too poor
to marry me.

125
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,715
It's all the worse now that
I'm visiting you... my rich friend.

126
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,637
Yes, but not one marriage proposal,
and here I am almost 20...

127
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,916
Practically a hag!

128
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,278
<i>Mr. Quincey P. Morris!</i>

129
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,234
Look! What is that?

130
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:33,351
A Texan. Quincey P. Morris.
He's so young and fresh.

131
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,957
- A wild stallion between my legs.
- You're positively indecent!

132
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:42,159
I just know what men desire.
Watch.

133
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,477
- Quincey, darling.
- Miss Lucy...

134
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,837
You're as fresh as a spring rain.

135
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,714
Quincey, please let me touch it.

136
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,679
It's so big.

137
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:10,632
My dear, sweet little girl. I hold
your hand, and you've kissed me.

138
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:16,318
Jack! Oceans of love...

139
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,995
Oh, my poor little baby!

140
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,517
Come over here,
my poor little blossom.

141
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:29,549
My poor, little, brilliant doctor.

142
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:35,113
- What a naughty bear.
- Arthur Holmwood, Esquire.

143
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,078
My darling.

144
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,432
I'm so sorry about your hat.

145
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,717
This is my snake dress.

146
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,433
<i>Lucy is a pure and virtuous girl,</i>
<i>but she does shock me sometimes.</i>

147
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,879
<i>Jonathan says a defect of the rich</i>
<i>is that they say what they please.</i>

148
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,795
<i>But I admire Lucy and I'm not</i>
<i>surprised men flock around her.</i>

149
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,158
<i>I wish I were as pretty</i>
<i>and as adored as she.</i>

150
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,590
<i>You are the love of my life.</i>

151
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,878
What manner of man is this?

152
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,670
R.N. Renfield, successful solicitor
in the firm of Hawkins & Thompkins.

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,832
Member of the Wyndham Club.

154
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,312
He returns from business abroad
in Transylvania-

155
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:45,999
- and suffers a mental breakdown.
He's obsessed with some bloodlust.

156
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,351
George.

157
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,918
Wait here.

158
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:07,757
Would you care for an hors d'oeuvre,
doctor, or a canapé?

159
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:14,871
- No, thank you. How are you?
- Better than my love-sick doctor.

160
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:20,637
- Does my private life interest you?
- Of course. All life interests me.

161
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:27,114
- Your diet is disgusting.
- They're perfectly nutritious.

162
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,115
Each life that I ingest
gives back life to me.

163
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,471
- A fly gives you life?
- Certainly.

164
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,909
You'll eat molecules with chopsticks
before I eat the lesser carnivorae.

165
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,995
I shall have to invent a new
classification of lunatic for you.

166
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,709
What about spiders?
Spiders eat the flies.

167
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,591
- Yes, spiders eat them.
- What about sparrows?

168
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:07,630
- Yes... did you say sparrows?
- Something larger perhaps?

169
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:14,148
Oh yes...
A kitten. I beg you!

170
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,592
A little, sleek, playful kitten.
Something I can teach.

171
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,355
Something I can feed.
Don't refuse me.

172
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,798
Wouldn't you prefer a cat?

173
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,671
Yes! A big cat!
My salvation depends upon it.

174
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,311
- Your salvation?
- Yes, lives for the Master.

175
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,995
Master? What master?

176
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,550
The Master will come.

177
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,430
- He's promised to make me immortal.
- How?

178
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,997
The blood is the life!

179
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,516
<i>Blood is the life!</i>

180
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:07,711
<i>30th May, Castle Dracula. I think</i>
<i>things that I dare not confess.</i>

181
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,396
<i>The way the Count looked at</i>
<i>Mina's picture fills me with fear.</i>

182
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:17,554
<i>As if I have a part to play</i>
<i>in a story that is not known to me.</i>

183
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,432
I didn't hear you come in.

184
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:51,115
Take care. You cut yourself.
It is more dangerous than you think.

185
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:01,069
A foul bauble of man's... vanity.

186
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,552
Perhaps you should grow a beard.

187
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:19,074
The letters I requested...
have you written them?

188
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,279
Good.

189
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,511
Should you leave these rooms,-

190
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:54,755
- you will not go to sleep
in any other part of the castle.

191
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:02,113
It is old and has many bad memories.

192
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:09,556
- Be warned.
- I'm sure I understand.

193
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,233
Do not put your faith in such...
trinkets of deceit.

194
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:28,116
We are in Transylvania,
and Transylvania is not England.

195
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,670
Our ways are not your ways.

196
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:37,039
And to you...
there shall be many strange things.

197
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:44,117
I've seen strange things already.
Wolves chasing me! A blue inferno!

198
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,753
Listen to them.

199
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,678
The children of the night.

200
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:07,155
- What sweet music they make.
- Music? Those animals?

201
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,353
<i>I did as Dracula instructed.</i>
<i>I wrote three letters.</i>

202
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,956
<i>To the firm, to my family,</i>
<i>and to my beloved Mina.</i>

203
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:50,636
<i>I said nothing of my fears,</i>
<i>as he will read them, no doubt.</i>

204
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,231
<i>I know now that I am a prisoner.</i>

205
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,953
<i>Jonathan...</i>

206
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,590
<i>Jonathan, come to me.</i>

207
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,512
<i>Come.</i>

208
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,990
<i>Lay down.</i>
<i>Lay back into my arms.</i>

209
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,119
<i>Lay back, Jonathan.</i>

210
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,790
What is this? Charlatans!

211
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,799
<i>Dearest Mina, all is well here.</i>

212
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:24,954
<i>The Count has insisted</i>
<i>that I remain here for a month.</i>

213
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:30,911
<i>I can say no more, except I</i>
<i>love you. Ever faithful, Jonathan.</i>

214
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:39,234
<i>The letters I have written</i>
<i>have undoubtedly sealed my doom.</i>

215
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:47,430
<i>The Count's gypsies, loyal to the</i>
<i>death to whomever they serve.</i>

216
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:57,071
<i>Day and night, they fill boxes with</i>
<i>earth from the castle's cellar.</i>

217
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:02,439
<i>They are to be delivered</i>
<i>to Carfax Abbey in London.</i>

218
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,153
<i>Why do they fill these boxes</i>
<i>with earth?</i>

219
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,511
I love him!

220
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:21,356
Mina, it's so wonderful.
I've decided.

221
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,911
- I love him and I've said yes!
- Finally.

222
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:30,278
- The Texan with the big knife?
- No, to my number three.

223
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:37,039
Lord Arthur Holmwood.
You're to be my maid of honor.

224
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,479
Mina, what is it? It's the most
exciting day of my life.

225
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:47,794
- You don't seem to care.
- I'm so worried about Jonathan.

226
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:54,149
This letter I received is so cold.
It's not like him at all.

227
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,393
Mina, don't worry.

228
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:27,153
<i>Captain's log, the Demeter.</i>
<i>27th June, 1897.</i>

229
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,033
<i>We picked up 50 boxes of earth</i>
<i>bound for London, England.</i>

230
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,876
<i>We set sail at noon into a storm</i>
<i>that seemed to come from nowhere, -</i>

231
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,191
- <i>carrying us out to sea.</i>

232
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,476
<i>3rd July. Second mate is missing.</i>
<i>Nearing Gibraltar.</i>

233
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,916
<i>Storm continues.</i>
<i>Crew uneasy.</i>

234
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:30,111
<i>Believes someone or something</i>
<i>is aboard the ship with us.</i>

235
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:47,396
He is here!
The master of all life is at hand!

236
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,792
Gather round! I am here
to do your bidding, Master!

237
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:57,751
I have worshipped you from afar,
but now you are near.

238
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,994
I am your slave.
I await your command.

239
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,873
The Renfield case
grows more interesting.

240
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,669
There is method in his madness,
with his flies and spiders.

241
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:16,313
Had I the secret
of even one such brilliant mind...

242
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,990
Lucy...

243
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,952
Lucy!

244
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:03,079
No, do not see me!

245
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,799
Lucy...

246
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:23,512
- I couldn't control myself.
- You're dreaming. Sleepwalking.

247
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,559
My soul...
It seemed to leave my body.

248
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:31,599
There was this agonizing feeling.

249
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,197
- I started shaking.
- It's all right, you're dreaming.

250
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:41,229
It pulled me and lured me.
I had no control.

251
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:49,273
Those red eyes. I still have
the taste of his blood in my mouth.

252
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,392
Master, I'm here to do your bidding.

253
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:18,598
Master, I am here.
I have worshipped you.

254
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:25,996
<i>The vampire,</i>
<i>like any other night-creature, -</i>

<i>this time his powers are weak.</i>

256
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,596
<i>See the amazing cinematograph.</i>

257
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,629
<i>A wonder of modern civilization.</i>
<i>The latest sensation.</i>

258
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:03,149
<i>The attraction of the century.</i>
<i>The new wonder of the world.</i>

259
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,477
<i>See the amazing cinematograph.</i>

260
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,678
See me.

261
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,597
See me now.

262
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,479
Escaped wolf still at large!
Paper, sir?

263
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,871
Thank you, sir.

264
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:11,032
My humblest apologies.
Forgive my ignorance.

265
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,638
I am recently arrived from abroad,
and I do not know your city.

266
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,318
- As a beautiful lady...
- Purchase a street atlas. Good day.

267
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,796
I have offended you.

268
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:32,512
I'm looking for the cinematograph.
The wonder of the civilized world.

269
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:39,791
If you seek culture, visit a museum.
London is filled with them.

270
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:53,989
A woman so lovely and intelligent
should not be walking alone.

271
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,311
Do I know you, sir?

272
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:02,349
Are you acquainted with my husband?
Shall I call the police?

273
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:10,235
Husband?
I shall bother you no more.

274
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,715
Sir...

275
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,238
It is I who have been rude.
If you're looking...

276
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:26,352
Permit me to introduce myself.

277
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,832
I am Prince Vlad of Sachait.

278
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:39,436
- A prince, no less.
- I am your servant.

279
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,713
Wilhelmina Murray.

280
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:53,391
I am honored, Madam Mina.

281
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,036
This way.

282
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:18,069
Mr. Holmwood asked me
to stop by to see Miss Lucy.

283
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,800
Dr. Seward, Miss Lucy.

284
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,670
Jack! Brilliant Jack!
Do you like it?

285
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:33,799
Did Arthur put you up to this?
Or did you want me alone?

286
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:41,150
Lucy, I'm here as your doctor.
Your fiancé is worried about you.

287
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:48,032
A doctor's confidence is sacred.
I must have your complete trust.

288
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:58,550
Help me, Jack. I don't know
what's happening to me.

289
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:03,555
I'm changing. I can feel it.

290
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:08,669
I can hear everything.
I can hear the servants whispering.

291
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:12,958
I hear mice in the attic
stomping like elephants.

292
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:19,275
But I'm having horrible nightmares.
The eyes...

293
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:24,309
- Jack...
- I'm here. Nothing will harm you.

294
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:32,956
- Let it work.
- Thank you...

295
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:36,430
Jack, kiss me.

296
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:45,273
Lucy is hotter than a June bride
riding bareback in the Sahara.

297
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,671
Watch your colonial tongue.

298
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:52,833
Hello, Jack.
How's our lovely patient today?

299
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:59,189
- Frankly, I'm confounded.
- Jack, are you still brooding?

300
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:05,799
- It must be something mental.
- How very droll. Did you hear that?

301
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:10,192
Last week he wanted to marry her,
now he wants to have her committed.

302
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,351
Let's have a look at her.

303
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:25,278
I'm at a loss, I admit.

304
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,070
I've cabled Abraham van Helsing,
the metaphysician-philosopher.

305
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:36,679
- He sounds like a witch doctor.
- He studies obscure diseases.

306
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:40,116
He's my teacher and mentor.

307
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:47,835
Do it, man.
Bring him here. Spare no expense.

308
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:26,157
Astounding.
There are no limits to science.

309
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:30,556
How can you call this science?

310
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:35,714
Do you think Madame Curie
would invite such comparisons?

311
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:44,030
I shouldn't have come here.
I must go.

312
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,511
Do not fear me.

313
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,232
Stop this!

314
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:22,316
My God, who are you?
I know you.

315
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:28,794
I have crossed oceans of time
to find you.

316
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,953
Come here, Mina.

317
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:55,269
He likes you.

318
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,312
There is much to be learned
from beasts.

319
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:38,357
A vampire bat must consume ten times
its own weight in blood each day,-

320
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:43,150
- or its own blood cells will die.

321
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:52,710
Cute little vermin.

322
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:57,874
Blood, and diseases of the blood
such as syphilis concern us here.

323
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:02,795
The very name venereal diseases,
the diseases of Venus,-

324
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,829
- imputes to them divine origin.
They involve the sex problem,-

325
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,232
- about which the ethics and ideals
of Christianity are concerned.

326
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:18,748
Civilization and syphilization
have advanced together.

327
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,198
- What is this?
- It's from the telegraph.

328
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:32,196
Thank you.
Gentlemen, that will be all.

329
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:46,071
<i>Dawn. These may be the last words</i>
<i>I write in this journal.</i>

330
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:50,631
<i>Dracula has left me with these</i>
<i>women, these devils of the pit.</i>

331
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:55,715
<i>They drain my blood to keep</i>
<i>me weak, so I cannot escape.</i>

332
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:01,989
<i>I will try one last time today</i>
<i>to find a passageway to the river.</i>

333
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:07,917
<i>I must leave this cursed land</i>
<i>where the Devil's children walk.</i>

334
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:22,594
<i>I do attest that at this point,</i>
<i>I, Abraham van Helsing, -</i>

335
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:26,833
- <i>became personally involved</i>
<i>in these strange events.</i>

336
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:22,876
Professor van Helsing.
How good of you to come.

337
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:31,397
I always come to a friend in need.
Tell me about your case.

338
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:37,510
She has the usual anemic signs.
Her blood is normal, yet it is not.

339
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:42,834
- She manifests repeated blood loss.
- Blood loss? How?

340
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,631
Close the doors!

341
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:09,396
My God, she is only a child.

342
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,031
My God!

343
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:18,716
She must have a transfusion at once.
Take off your jacket.

344
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:23,112
- You know how to tie a tourniquet.
- You perfected a procedure.

345
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:28,718
No, I only experimented.
Landsteiner's method.

346
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,314
Animals, goats, sheep...

347
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:36,593
If hemolysis occurs in the serum,
her red blood cells will explode,-
