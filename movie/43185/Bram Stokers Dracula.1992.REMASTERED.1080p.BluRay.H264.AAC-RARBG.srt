1462年

3
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,670
康斯坦丁堡陷落

4
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,240
信奉回教的土耳其人大軍橫掃歐洲
Moslem Turks swept into Europe with a vast, superior force...

5
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:53,500
痛擊羅馬尼亞威脅整個基督教世界
striking at Romania, threatening all of Christendom.

6
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,220

From Transylvania arose a Romanian knight of the Sacred Order of the Dragon,

7
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,920
名叫德古拉

8
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,140
戰役前夕
On the eve of the battle...

9
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:24,940
他摯愛的新娘伊莉莎白
his bride Elisabeta whom he prized above all things on Earth...

10
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,480
知道他將與強敵對陣
knew that he must face an insurmountable force...

11
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,150
可能一去不返
from which he might never return.

12
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,940
(讚美主)

13
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,950
(我已獲勝)

14
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,620
伊莉莎白

15
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,960
詭詐的土耳其軍射箭入城
The vengeful Turks shot an arrow into the castle...

16
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,560
散佈德古拉陣亡的謠言
carrying false news of Dracula's death.

17
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,570
伊莉莎白信以為真
Elisabeta, believing him dead...

18
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,470
投河自盡
flung herself into the river.

19
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,340
我的王子死了

20
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,080

All is lost without him.

21
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,090
但願能在天上重逢
May God unite us in heaven.

22
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,630
(她是自盡死的)

23
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,580
(她的靈魂不能升天堂)

24
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,770
(要受天譴)

25
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,780
(這是神的律令)

26
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,450
(這就是我捍衛教會的報償嗎?)

27
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,520
(放肆)

28
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,330
(我唾棄上帝)

29
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,860
(我將死後複生)

30
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,610
(用盡邪惡力量為她復仇)

31
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,430
(血是生命泉源)

32
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,360
(我將飲血維生)

33
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:42,660

00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,890
(卡費斯區精神病院)

37
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,750
我都照你的吩咐做了,主人

38
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:10,560
一切準備就緒

我等待你的命令
I await your command.

41
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,890
因為
For I know...

42
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,770
當你論功行賞時

43
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,180
你的慷慨會使我受益無窮

謝謝
Thank you.

45
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,620
倫費發狂了
Gone mad. Renfield is deranged.

46
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,520
心智喪失
He's lost his greedy mind, poor chap.

47
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,590
替個外國人德古拉伯爵理財
I want you to take over for his foreign client this rather eccentric Count Dracula.

48
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,930
他要在倫敦近郊買房產
- He's buying up property around London. - Of course, sir.

49
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,870
我會轉告伯爵,謝謝你的委派
I'll attend to the count. Thank you for your confidence.

50
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,940
這是你的大好良機,哈克

51
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,200
但你必須立刻前往川索凡尼亞
But you'll have to leave for Transylvania immediately.

52
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,080
終生難遇的機會
Opportunities such as this come but once in a lifetime.

53
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,180
那當然
Yes, of course, sir.

54
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,010
倫費先生在川索凡尼亞怎麼了
If I may inquire...what, in fact, happened to Mr. Renfield in Transylvania?

55
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,020
沒什麼
Nothing. Nothing.

56
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,250
私人問題
Personal problems.

57
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:19,600
完成這些交易你在公司的前途無量

59
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,940
我們等了那麼久
We've waited this long, haven't we?

60
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,600
我一回來就結婚
We can be married when I return.

61
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,000
好吧
Of course.

62
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,020
我會寫信的
I'll write.

63
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,680
強納生
Jonathan.

64
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,790
強納生,我愛你

65
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,520
我愛你,米娜

5月25日,布達佩斯

今晨離開布達佩斯
Left Budapest early this morning.

68
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,820
依我看...
The impression I had was that we were leaving the west...

69
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,030
我們是往東歐前進(強納生哈克之日記)
and entering the east.

70
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,510
這一帶是羅馬尼亞最東部
The district I am to enter is in the extreme east of the country...

71
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,210
摩達維亞、布卡維納及川索凡尼亞
just on the borders of three states...Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina...

72
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,410
喀爾巴阡山交界處
in the midst of the Carpathian Mountains...

73
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,910
歐洲最荒涼無名的一區
one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe.

74
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,680
朋友
"My friend...

75
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,250
歡迎到喀爾巴阡山
welcome to the Carpathians.

76
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,520
久候大駕多時
I am anxiously expecting you.

77
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,930
我的馬車
At the Borgo Pass...

78
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,430
將在波戈隘口等你
my carriage will await you and bring you to me.

79
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:06,210
深信你一路順暢
I trust yourjourney from London has been a happy one...

80
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,700
並希望你在我國
and that you will enjoy your stay...

81
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,370
身心愉快
in my beautiful land.

82
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,600
你的朋友敬上 
Your friend,

5月25日,日記
Diary, 25th May.

85
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,890
親愛的強納生離去近一周(米娜墨瑞之日記)
My Jonathan has been gone almost a week.

86
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:35,760
我雖因不能立刻成婚感到失望
And although I was disappointed we could not marry before his departure...

87
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,230
仍為他出使重要任務而高興
I am happy that he got sent on this important assignment.

88
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,900
我渴望他的音訊
I am longing to hear all the news.

89
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,180
到外國一定很有趣
It must be so nice to see strange countries.

90
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:51,710
不知我們能否一同出國遊覽
I wonder if we... I mean Jonathan and l...shall ever see them together.

91
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,470
我們來早了,還沒人來
We're early, driver. No one is here.

92
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,670
(死人才走的快)

93
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,910
城堡遠不遠?
I say, is the castle far?

94
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,400
歡迎光臨寒舍
Welcome to my home.

95
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:56,000
輕鬆自在地進來
Enter freely of your own will...

96
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,830
將你的歡樂留下
and leave some of the happiness you bring.

97
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,840
德古拉伯爵
Count Dracula?

98
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,940
在下就是
I am...

99
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,000
德古拉

100
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,740
寒舍蓬壁生輝了,哈克先生
And I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house.

101
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,350
請進
Come in.

102
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,540
請恕我
You will, I trust, excuse me that I...

103
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,370
不能奉陪
do not join you.

104
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,950
我已經吃過了
But I have already dined.

105
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,280
而且我從不喝
And I never drink...

106
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,280
葡萄酒
wine.

107
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,560
你的祖先? 五官很像
An ancestor? I see a resemblance.

108
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,540
德古拉的徽記
The Order of the Dracul.

109
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,900
是條龍
The Dragon.

110
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,140
古代有個社
An ancient society...

111
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,410
我的祖先宣誓入會
pledging my forefathers...

112
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,650
保護教會抵禦外侮
to defend their church against all enemies of Christ.

113
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,590
結果卻和教會
That relationship was not entirely...

114
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,180
鬧僵
successful.

115
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,130
是嗎?
Oh, yes.

116
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,870
這不是開玩笑的事
It is no laughing matter.

117
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,970
我們德古家值得驕傲
We Draculs have a right to be proud.

118
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,810
不論阿提拉大帝如何殘暴
What devil or witch was ever so great as Attila...

119
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,810
我也流著相同的血液
whose blood flows in these veins?

120
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,380
血！
Blood...

121
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,560
這年頭成寶了
is too precious a thing in these times.

122
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,500
殺伐的年代已過去
The warlike days are over.

123
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,240
我家族的光榮戰跡
The victories of my great race...

124
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,340
只成為故事
are but a tale to be told.

125
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:29,090
我是最後一名子嗣
I am the last of my kind.

126
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:34,930
恕我無知,伯爵
I have offended you with my ignorance, Count.

127
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,530
原諒我
Forgive me.

128
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:56,080
我渴望在倫敦擁擠的街道行走
I do so long to go through the crowded streets...of your mighty London...

129
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,120
混在匆忙的人群中
to be in the midst of the whirl and the rush of humanity...

130
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,450
分享它的生命力
to share its life...

131
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,960
它的改變
its changes,

132
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,560
及死亡
its death.

133
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:09,560
完成了 伯爵
There. You, Count, are...

134
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,130
你是卡費教堂的所有人
are the owner of Carfax Abbey at Purfleet.

135
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,630
恭喜
Congratulations.

136
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:22,040
貴公司對你贊許有加
Your firm writes most highly...of your talents.

137
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,640
他們說你的品味
They say you are a man of good...

138
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,410
很高

139
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,070
還說你能力不輸給
And that you are a worthy substitute...

140
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,410
前任...
to your predecessor,

141
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,980
倫費先生
Mr. Renfield.

142
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,990
你可以相信我
You may rely on me, Count.

143
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,490
恕我好奇
Forgive my curiosity, but why ten houses...

144
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:45,060
為何十所房子都買在倫敦附近
in such precise locations around London?

145
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,630
炒地皮?
Is it to raise the market value?

146
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,200
你相信宿命嗎
Do you believe in destiny?

147
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,040
時間都可因...
That even the powers of time...

148
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,070
某一...
can be altered for

149
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,650
目的而改變?
a single purpose?

150
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:19,570
找到真愛的人才是...
The luckiest man who walks on this Earth...is the one who finds...

151
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,230
最幸運的人
true love.

152
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,990
你找到米娜了
You found Mina.

153
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,830
我以為丟了呢
I thought she was lost.

154
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,840
我回去後就結婚
We're to be married as soon as I return.

155
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,510
你結婚了嗎 伯爵?
Are you married, Count?

156
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,170
先生
Sir...

157
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,780
你結婚了嗎?
are you married?

158
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,680
結過一次
I was married once.

159
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,920
多年以前
Ages ago, it seems.

160
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,590
她死了
She died.

161
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,750
真令人難過
I'm very sorry.

162
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,030
是她命好
She was fortunate.

163
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:59,030
我一生淒涼
My life, at its best, is misery.

164
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,870
她一定會是個賢妻
She will no doubt make a devoted wife.

165
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,110
而你是個忠實的丈夫
And you a faithful husband.

166
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,480
來
Come.

167
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,990
寫信給你公司
Write now, my friend, to your firm...

168
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,560
與心愛的人,說你要...
and to any loved ones, and say that it shall please you...

169
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:28,060
陪我住一個月
to stay with me...until a month from now.

170
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,000
一個月?
A month?

171
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,430
你要我待那麼久?
Do you wish me to stay so long?

172
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,680
不可以拒絕
I will take no refusal.

173
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,290
1897年5月3O日,日記
Diary, 30th of May, 1897.

174
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,820
強納生不願我在他出差時與露西同住
I know that Jonathan does not want me to stay here with Lucy while he is away.

175
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:05,130
他怕我習慣威斯丁家的富貴後
He thinks that if I become accustomed to the wealth of the Westenra family...

176
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,310
便不肯當法律事務所職員的妻子
I will not be content as the wife of a mere clerk in a law firm.

177
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,380
但我和露西自幼是好友
But Lucy and I have been friends since we were children...

178
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,880
她不在乎我只是個教師
and she has never minded that I am only a schoolmistress.

179
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,830
好噁心
How disgustingly awful.

180
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,020
米娜
Mina!

181
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,460
(一千零一夜)

182
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,160
米娜
Mina!

183
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,160
米娜,你老在工作
Oh, Mina, you're always working.

184
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:46,240
你那有野心的強納生逼你學打字?
Is your ambitious Jon Harker...forcing you to learn that ridiculous machine?

185
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,680
他也能逼你
When he could be forcing you to perform...

186
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:54,080
低級熱情演出
unspeakable acts of desperate passion on the parlor floor.

187
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:58,020
露西,你不該這樣說我未婚夫
Lucy, really.You shouldn't talk about my fiance in such a way.

188
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,120
婚姻不只是肉體享樂
There's more to marriage than carnal pleasure.

189
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,190
喔 米娜  是哦！
Oh, Mina. So I see.

190
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,360
要多的多
Much, much more.

191
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,190
那是
That's...

192
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,370
這是什麼?露西
What is it, Lucy?

193
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,210
我看不懂
Because I don't understand it.

194
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,140
男女真的...
Can a man and woman really do...

195
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,150
這麼做嗎?
that?

196
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,750
我昨晚就做過
I did, only last night.

197
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,120
騙人!你沒有
Fibber. You did not.

198
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,850
我有
Yes, I did.

199
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,980
在我的夢裡
Well, in my dreams.

200
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,490
強納生有這麼棒吧?
Jonathan measures up, doesn't he?

201
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,000
你可以告訴我的
You can tell Lucy.

202
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,440
我們只接過吻
We've kissed. That's all.

203
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,660
他覺得娶不起我
He thinks he's too poor to marry me.

204
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,180
更糟的是我到你的華宅看你
And it's all the worse now that I'm here visiting you at Hillingham...

205
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,900
我的富有朋友
my rich friend.

206
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:56,410
卻沒人向我求過婚
Yes, but not even one marriage proposal.

207
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,080
我快滿20了
And here I am, almost 20...

208
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,190
是個老處女了
practically a hag.

209
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:10,020
昆西摩裡斯先生到
Mr. Quincey P. Morris.

210
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,100
你看
Oh, look.

211
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,360
那是什麼人
What is that?

212
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,930
德州人
A Texan.

213
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,930
昆西摩裡斯
Quincey P. Morris.

214
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,940
他好年輕稚氣
He's so young and fresh...

215
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,370
像我胯間的野種馬
like a wild stallion between my legs.

216
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,380
你真下流
You're positively indecent.

217
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,540
我只是知道男人想要什麼
I just know what men desire.

218
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,450
看著
Watch.

219
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,480
昆西達令

00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,040
露西小姐
Miss Lucy.

221
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,720
你像春雨般清新
Why, you're as fresh as the spring rain.

222
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,380
謝謝
Oh, thank you.

223
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,280
昆西
Quincey.

224
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,030
求求你讓我摸摸
Please let me touch it.

225
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,120
好...
It's so...

226
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,230
大

小女孩
Little girl.

228
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,740
我親愛的小女孩
Oh, my dear, sweet little girl.

229
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,080
我握著你的手,你也吻過我
I hold your hand...- and you've kissed me.

230
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,240

愛你深似海

我的達令,小寶貝
Poor little baby.

233
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,490
小貓咪過來
My kitten, come over here.

234
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,820
來,吻一個就會好了
Come over here and I'll kiss it better.

235
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,260
我可憐的小花
My poor little blossom.

236
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,590
我可憐的小郎中,小醫生
My poor little doctor. Brilliant doctor.

237
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,170
嗨 昆西   傑克
- Hello, Quincey. - Jack.

238
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,400
壞熊,我摸摸爪子
What a naughty bear. Let me...

239
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,770
亞瑟荷伍先生到
Arthur Holmwood, Esquire.

240
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,200
亞瑟
Arthur!

241
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,930
親愛的
Oh, my darling.

242
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,280
你氣色真好
Oh, you look wonderful.

243
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,940
抱歉弄壞你的帽子
I'm so sorry about your hat.

244
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,970
好美 這是我的妖女裝

245
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,020
真的嗎?
Is it really?

246
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,110
露西純潔有德
Lucy is a pure and virtuous girl...

247
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:45,850
但她言語大膽真叫我震驚
but I admit that her free way of speaking shocks me sometimes.

248
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:51,960
強納生說貴族都是口無遮攔
Jonathan says it is a defect of the aristocracy...that they say what they please.

249
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,870
但我崇拜露西
The truth is that I admire Lucy,

250
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,800
難怪男人愛她
and I'm not surprised that men flock around her.

251
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,140
我希望我像她一樣漂亮迷人
I wish I were as pretty and as adored as she.

252
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,660
他是怎樣的人?
What manner of man is this?

253
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,720
亞倫費,霍湯公司得力幹部
R.M. Renfield, successful solicitor...

in the firm of Hawkins and Thompkins...respected member of the Lord Nugent's Windem Club...

255

257
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,180
他現在嗜血如命

258

259
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,020
在這裡等一下
Wait here.

260
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:02,770
吃開胃菜?西渥先生
Would you care for an hors d'oeuvre, Dr. Seward...

261
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,030
還是點心?
or a canape?

262
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,870
不了,謝謝,倫費先生
No, thank you, Mr. Renfield.

263
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,530
今晚感覺如何?
How are you feeling tonight?

264
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:11,270
比你好,單相思醫生
Far better than you, my lovesick doctor.

265
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,270
你對我的私生活有興趣
Is my personal life of interest to you?

266
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,940
對,我對所有人都有興趣
Of course it is. All life interests me.

267
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,880
你的食物,倫費先生
Your diet, Mr. Renfield, is disgusting.

268
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,380
真噁心
Actually,

269
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:23,380
實際上很營養
they're perfectly nutritious.

270
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,890
我所攝取的生命
You see, each life that I ingest...

271
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:29,290
會帶給我生命
gives back life to me.

272
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,120
蒼蠅帶給你生命?
A fly gives you life?

273
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,130
沒錯
Certainly.

274
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:42,000
叫我吃一般食物
But you might as well ask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chopsticks...

275
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,810
比用筷子夾分子還難
than to interest me in a lesser carnivore.

276
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:48,470
我要為你發明瘋子新分類法
I shall have to invent a new classification of lunatic for you.

麻雀你吃嗎?
What about sparrows?

280
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,490
吃！
Oh, yes.

281
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,590
你剛說麻雀嗎?
Did you say sparrows?

282
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,750
體型大點的
Something larger, perhaps?

283
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,830
對
Oh, yes.

284
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,000
小貓
A kitten.

285
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,770
求求你
I beg you.

286
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,770
一隻...
A little, sleek... a playful kitten.

287
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,510
受教愛玩
Something I can teach. Something I can feed.

288
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,670
可餵食的小貓 小貓而已嘛
No one would refuse me a kitten.

289
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:24,110
成貓好嗎
Wouldn't you prefer a cat?

290

00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,540
聽得到僕人在房屋另一端私語

老實說我很惶惑
Well, frankly, Arthur, I'm confounded.

526
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:59,020
你還在替露西小姐擔心
Jack, are you still broodin' over Miss Lucy?

527
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:02,520
我看她神智錯亂
I can only conclude it must be something mental.

528
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:06,030
胡說  你聽到沒
How very droll. Did you hear that, Quince?

Let's have a look at her.

531
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:25,790
我也不明白
I'm at a loss, I admit.

532
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:31,320
我已拍電報給亞伯漢梵海辛精神哲學家
I've taken the liberty of cabling Abraham Van Helsing...the metaphysician/philosopher.

533
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,230
我看他是個巫醫
Sounds like a goddamn witch doctor to me, Jack.

534
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:38,060
他是疑難雜症權威
Van Helsing knows more about obscure diseases than any man in the world.

535
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,390

He's my teacher and mentor.

536
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:44,910

541
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:33,620
這哪叫科學
How can you call this science?

542
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:39,360
居里夫人會同意這看法嗎?
Do you think Madam Curie would invite such comparisons?Really.

543
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:45,130
我不該來的
I shouldn't have come here.

544
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,130
我得走了
I must go.

545

我跨越...時間的瀚海來尋你
I have crossed oceans of time...

551
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:16,130
各位來賓不要驚慌
There is no need to panic.

552
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:19,620
捕獸師自會處理
The animal handlers have everything under complete control.

553
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,110
過來,米娜
Come here, Mina.

554

野獸能教導我們許多事
There is much to be learned from beasts.

556
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:34,090
(好友瀕死,不明原因之血疾)

557

(我急需協助,傑克西渥)

558

熱帶吸血蝙蝠一天
The tropical pampas vampire bat must...

559
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:52,010
要吸體重十倍的鮮血
consume ten times its own weight in fresh blood each day...

560
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:55,280
否則它自己會死
or its own blood cells will die.

561
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:06,320
小混球
Cute little vermin, ja?

562
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:10,260
我們研究血液及血液疾病
Blood and the diseases of the blood...

563
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,000
如梅毒
such as syphilis, they concern us here.

564
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,370
性病“愛神之疾”
The very name "venereal diseases"...the diseases of Venus,

565
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:20,200
非常傳神
imputes to them divine origin.

566
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:23,940
牽涉到基督文明
And they are involved in that sex problem about which...

567
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:28,280
對倫理與性的觀念
the ethics and ideals of Christian civilization are concerned.

568
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:33,150
其實 文明與梅毒幾乎同步發展
In fact, civilization and syphilization have advanced together.

569
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,350
這是什麼
What is this?

570
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:39,290
電報,教授
It's from the telegraph, Professor.

571
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:40,690

德古拉把我丟給這些妖女
Dracula has left me with these women...

576
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:08,520
她們喝我的血
these devils of the pit.

577
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:11,090
讓我氣息猶存
They drain my blood to keep me weak...

578
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:13,590
卻逃不了
barely alive so I cannot escape.

579
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,100
我今天嘗試最後一次逃到水邊
I will try one last time today to escape to the water.

580
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:20,100
一定有路可以通到河邊
There must be passageway to the river...

581
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,670
逃出這受詛之地
and then away from this cursed land...

582
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:25,840
及披著人皮的群魔
where the devil and his children still walk with earthly feet.

583
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:38,550
我正式宣佈
For the record, I do attest...

584
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:41,890
此刻亞拉漢梵海辛
that at this point, I, Abraham Van Helsing...

585
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:45,760
親自調查這些怪事
became personally involved in these strange events.

586
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:43,180
梵海辛教授,你果然來了
Professor Van Helsing, how good of you to come.

587
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:50,530
我一向樂於説明需要我的朋友
I always come to my friends in need when they call me.

588
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,520
把病情詳細告訴我
So, Jack, tell me everything about your case.

589
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:56,690
她有一般貧血症狀
She has all the usual physical anemic signs.

590
00:58:56,830 --> 00:58:58,820
血液分析正常
Her blood analyzes normal, and yet it is not.

591
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:02,270
但事實上她持續失血
She manifests continued blood loss.

592
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:03,670
我找不出原因
I cannot trace the cause.

593
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:05,170
失血?怎麼會
Blood loss? How?

594
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:16,320
把門關上
My God, close the doors!

595
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:28,990
天啊
My God...

596
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:31,000
她還是個孩子
she's only a child.

597
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:34,300
是啊
Ja.

598
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:37,070
老天！
My God.

599
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:42,410
不得延誤立刻輸血,脫掉外套
There's no time to lose. There must be a transfusion at once.Take off your coat.

600
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,610
還會綁止血帶吧
Remember how to tie a tourniquet?Or have you forgotten?

601
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,080
你精通輸血?
You perfected a procedure?

602
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:51,690
精通?不,我只會藍斯坦法
Perfected? No. I've only experimented.Landsteiner's method.

603
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,680
只替動物輸過,山羊、綿羊啦
Animals, goats, sheeps.

604
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:01,160
若血清有溶血現象紅血球會破裂
If hemolysis occurs in the blood donor serum...her red blood cells will explode.

605
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,590
她就會死,把管子拿好
She will die. Take this tube.

606
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,670
你們在搞什麼
What in God's name is going on up here?

607
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:11,430
這位是梵海辛教授
This is Professor Van Helsing, Art.

608
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:12,910
他把露西怎麼了
What the hell is he doing to Lucy?

609
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:14,270
救她的命
He's trying to save her life.

610
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:15,140
老天！
Good God!

611
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:16,410
你是她的未婚夫
You're the fiance?

612
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,640
請讓開
Please.

613
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:19,610
請！
Please.

614
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:25,280
外套脫掉,她生命垂危須輸血
Take off your coat. This young lady's very ill. She's dying.She wants blood and blood she must have.

615
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:27,190
外套脫掉！
Take off your coat.

616
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:28,950
袖子卷起來
Roll up your sleeve, Art.

617
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:32,720
老天！快！
- Oh, God. - Quickly, quickly.

618
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,290
卷起來
Roll it up!

619
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:36,460
可能有點痛
This may hurt a little, Art.

620
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:52,550
請原諒我  她是我的命,最後一滴血都行
Forgive me. My life is hers. I would give my last drop of blood to save her.

621
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:53,810
最後一滴?
Your last drop?

622
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:56,810
謝謝,歡迎你
Thank you.You are very welcome here.

623
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:58,960
我不要那麼多
I don't ask as much as that.

624
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:00,150
目前還不要
 Not yet.

625
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,690
握住她的手
Hold her hand.

626
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:18,540
傑克...她輸了兩人份的血
Jack, that poor creature has had the blood of two men put into her already.

627
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:22,300
媽呀!她裝不了那麼多血
Man alive. Her whole body couldn't hold that much blood.

628
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,680
露西的血去哪呢
What took it out?

629
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,780
問的好,摩裡斯先生
That's a good question, Mr. Morris.

630
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:35,990
喉嚨那些痕跡?
Those marks on her throat...

631
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:40,660
不是疾病或傷痕,而是失血處
no disease, no trituration...I am sure the blood loss occurred there.

632
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:43,120
血去哪呢?
Oh? Where did the blood go?

633
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:46,570
你以前是個細心的學生
You were once a careful student, Jack.

634
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,740
用腦呀,血去哪了?告訴我!
Use your brain! Where did the blood go?Tell me!

635
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:53,470
床鋪上有血   沒錯
- The bed would be covered in blood. - Exactly.

636
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:58,470
你沒觀察到不可知的現象
You do not let your eyes see nor your ears hear...that which you cannot account for.

637
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:02,640
有異物吸她的血後飛走?
Something just went up there, sucked it out of her and flew away?

638
01:02:04,350 --> 01:02:05,910
對 有何不可?
Ja. Why not?

639
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:10,360
高明,真高明
That's brilliant. That's absolutely brilliant.

640
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:14,690
請問神醫,露西是怎麼了?
Will one of you learned doctors... or whatever you are...kindly tell me what is going on with my Lucy?

641
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:18,600
傑克,你是個科學家
Jack, you are a scientist.

642
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:23,440
宇宙中可有你不明了的事實?
Do you not think there are things in this universe you cannot understand...and which are true...

643
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:24,970
像是催眠
mesmerism, hypnotism?

644
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:26,840
你和夏卡已證實了
You and Charcot have proved hypnotism.

645
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:29,770
實體與靈體
Materialization, astral bodies.

646
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:39,790
教授?
Professor?

647
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,190
他去哪了
Where did he go?

648
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,290
看到了吧
You see?

649
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,800
我像是個菜烏
I feel like a blundering novice.

650
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:53,870
我們對抗的不是疾病
Gentlemen, we're not fighting some disease here.

651
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:59,040
露西小姐的咬痕是妖魔所致
Those marks on your dear Miss Lucy's neck were made...by something unspeakable out there.

652
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,370
已死又未死
Dead, but not dead.

653
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:03,610
妖魔追獵我們,原因不明
It stalks us for some dread purpose I do not comprehend.

654
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,640
它吸露西的血維持生命
To live, it feeds on Lucy's precious blood.

655
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:09,310
是個野獸,怪物
It is a beast, a monster.

656
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:30,900
我和露西是怎麼了
What is happening to Lucy and to me?

657
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:34,130
年幼時我從不煩躁
When I was younger, my feelings were never troubled.

658
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:36,570
真希望能恢復往日
I wish I were myself again...

659
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:39,580
那麼敏銳,永可依賴的米娜
the sensible Mina I always depended on.

660
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,750
艾伯森酒
Absinthe...

661
01:03:49,330 --> 01:03:52,160
含春藥的成份
is the aphrodisiac of the self.

662
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:55,760
住在酒裡的...
The green fairy...

663
01:03:56,330 --> 01:04:00,070
綠仙子
who lives in the absinthe...

664
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:03,230
要你的靈魂
wants your soul.

665
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,170
但是
But...

666
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:10,680
你可以放心
you are safe with me.

667
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:28,290
王子...
Tell me, Prince...

668
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:31,090
告訴我你家鄉的事
tell me of your home.

669
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:38,110
全世界最美麗的地方
The most beautiful place...in all creation.

670
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:42,810
一定是
Yes, it must be.

671
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:48,880
森林
A land beyond a great,

672
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:50,450
密佈
vast forest...

673
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:56,120
山巒起伏
surrounded by majestic mountains...

674
01:04:57,790 --> 01:04:59,630
葡萄園
lush vineyards...

675
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:06,070
遍地無處可比擬的
and flowers of such frailty and beauty...

676
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,840
妖豔花朵
as to be found nowhere else.

677
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:22,680
你說的好像親眼看過
You've described my home...as if you had seen it firsthand.

678
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:29,390
或許受你的聲調影響
It's your voice, perhaps.

679
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,090
好熟悉
It's so familiar.

680
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,730
仿佛...
It's like...

681
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:40,600
夢中無法認出的聲音
It's like a voice in a dream I cannot place...

682
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:45,260
在我孤獨時
and it comforts me.

683
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:47,940
安撫我  在你孤獨時
- When I am alone. - When you are alone.

684
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:12,560
王妃呢?
And what of the princess?

685
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:20,710
王妃?
Princess?

686
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:23,240
有王子就有王妃
There is always a princess...

687
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:27,640
穿著白衣裙
with gowns flowing white.

688
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:34,820
她的臉
And her face.

689
01:06:35,090 --> 01:06:36,390
天啊
Oh, God...

690
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,730
她的臉
her face...

691
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:45,200
是條河
is a river.

692
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,400
王妃
The princess...

693
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:57,810
是條....充滿傷痛
she's a river filled with tears of sadness...

694
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:01,240
心碎淚水的河
and heartbreak.

695
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,660
是有過王妃
There was a princess.

696
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:11,660
伊莉莎白
Elisabeta.

697
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:18,930
她是全世界最耀眼的女子
She was the most radiant woman...in all the empires of the world.

698
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:30,050
謠言拆散了她與王子
Man's deceit took her from her ancient prince.

699
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:33,610
她投入...
She leapt to her death...

700
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:37,350
你提到的河而死
into the river that you spoke of.

701
01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:42,050
我的 母語...
In my mother's tongue...

702
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:48,420
那條河叫
it is called...argesh.

703
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,370
王妃河
River princess.

704
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:30,260
親愛的女士
Dear Madam.

705
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:33,460
你的未婚夫在修道院(阿格莎修女8月12日之信)
Your fiance is safe and in the care...

706
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:35,940
安然無恙
of the good sisters of the Blessed Sacrament.

707
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:41,640
哈克先生認為你有生命危險
Mr. Harker believes your life is in extreme danger...

708
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:45,410
他急切希望你到此
and he desires with all urgency that you join him here...

709
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:48,420
立刻成婚
so that you may immediately be married.

710
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:50,880
祝福你
Yours with all blessings,

711
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,850
阿格莎修女上
Sister Agatha.

712
01:09:55,530 --> 01:09:57,320
親愛的王子
My sweet prince.

713
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:00,430
絕不能讓強納生知道
Jonathan must never know of us.

714
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:09,770
露西
Lucy!

715
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,430
我是亞拉漢梵海辛
I'm Abraham Van Helsing.

716
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:13,010
梵海辛博士
Dr. Van Helsing.

717
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:16,080
你是米娜小姐,露西的好友?
And you're Madam Mina, dear friend to our Lucy, ja?

718
01:10:16,510 --> 01:10:17,600
她怎樣了
How is she, doctor?

719
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:19,440
仍很虛弱
She's still very weak.

720
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:24,250
她告訴我你擔心你愛的強納生
She tells me of your beloved Jonathan Harker...and your worry for him.

721
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:27,280
我為所有的年輕愛侶擔心
Well, I, too, worry for all young lovers.

722
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:33,450
生命中有黑暗
There are darknesses in life, my child...

723
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:35,960
也有光明
and there are lights.

724
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:38,790
你便是光明,親愛的米娜
You are one of the lights, dear Mina...

725
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,230
光明中的光明
the light of all light.

726
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:48,070
去看你的朋友吧
Go now. See your friend.

727
01:11:04,830 --> 01:11:06,290
米娜
Mina.

728
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:11,660
你不太一樣,米娜
You look different,Mina.

729
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:15,000
臉上發光
You look positively radiant.

730
01:11:15,610 --> 01:11:17,040
有強納生的消息
You heard from Jonathan.

731
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:20,360
是嗎?  嗯
- Didn't you? - Yes.

732
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:22,940
他平安無事,露西
He's safe,Lucy.

733
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:25,680
在羅馬尼亞一家修道院
He's in a convent in Romania.

734
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:29,170
得了嚴重的腦熱病
He's suffering from a violent brain fever.

735
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:32,750
修女替他寫信
The good sisters are caring for him.They wrote to me,

736
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:35,080
說他需要我
and they say he needs me...

737
01:11:37,930 --> 01:11:39,090
但....我不去
but I won't go.

738
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:41,430
我不要丟下你
I'm not going to leave you.

739
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,560
米娜
Mina.

740
01:11:43,970 --> 01:11:46,370
你必須去
You've got to go to him...

741
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,190
你要愛他
and you've got to love him...

742
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:51,700
立刻嫁給他
and marry him right then and there.

743
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:55,870
這個你收下
And I want you to take this, my sister.

744
01:11:56,550 --> 01:11:58,410
我送你的賀禮
It's my wedding gift to you.

745
01:11:58,550 --> 01:12:00,020
不,露西
No,Lucy.

746
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:02,910
別擔心任性的小露西
Don't worry about spoiled little Lucy.

747
01:12:05,290 --> 01:12:06,980
我會康復的
I'll be all right.

748
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,860
代我向強納生致愛
Tell Jonathan oceans of love.

749
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:27,570
傑克 她怎麼了?
Jack, how is she?

750
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:48,720
我受不了大蒜味
This is why I cannot breathe!

751
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,200
露西 這是藥
Lucy, it's medicinal.

752
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:53,830
會助你睡得好
To help you sleep. To dream better dreams.

753
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:56,900
只是普通大蒜嘛
It's garlic! It's nothing but common garlic!

754
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,170
昆西來看你了
Quincey's here to see you.

755
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:00,670
拿點白蘭地來
Get some brandy.

756
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,040
露西小姐
Now, Miss Lucy,

757
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:06,350
你好好休息,亞瑟叫我來看你
you just rest easy.Arthur sent me to take care of you.

758
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:09,510
他說你不快好,我就得
He said if you don't get better quick...

759
01:13:09,690 --> 01:13:12,090
一槍斃了你,像對跛腳馬般
I have to put you out of your misery like a lame horse.

760
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:17,690
你真野蠻
You're such a beast.

761
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:22,760
吻我好嗎?昆西?
Will you kiss me?Quincey?

762
01:13:25,970 --> 01:13:27,370
吻我
Kiss me.

763
01:13:30,610 --> 01:13:31,600
吻我
Kiss me.

764
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:37,410
老笨蛋
That old coot!

765
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:39,240
放開我
Get off me!

766
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:41,580
露西,聽我說
Lucy,Listen to me!

767
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:43,910
睡覺  快睡覺
Sleep, sleep now. Sleep.

768
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:48,320
睡吧
You're at peace.

769
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:49,480
你們看
Look. There. There.

770
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:57,190
吸血鬼
Nosferatu.

771
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:05,140
(吸血鬼)

772
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,840
此篇講述野蠻的
"Here occurs the shocking and frightening history...

773
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:17,840
德古拉王子駭人野史
of the wild, berserk Prince Dracula...

774
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:20,010
他將人插住
How he impaled people and roasted them...

775
01:14:20,190 --> 01:14:21,850
烤身、煮頭
boiled their heads in a kettle...

776
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:24,360
活生生的剝皮
how he skinned them alive...

777
01:14:24,530 --> 01:14:27,860
淩遲,飲他們的血
and hacked them to pieces and then drank their blood."

778
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:34,100
德古拉
Dracul.

779
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,700
血便是生命
For blood is the life.

780
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:54,390
親愛的王子
"My dearest Prince,

781
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:56,390
請原諒我
forgive me.

782
01:14:56,790 --> 01:15:00,060
我收到未婚夫自羅馬尼亞的信
I have received word from my fiance in Romania.

783
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:03,730
我要去見他並完婚
I am en route to join him. We are to be married.

784
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,990
永不再見
I will never see you again.

785
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:08,930
米娜上
Mina."

786
01:15:18,850 --> 01:15:23,980
奇怪,那位怪友好像也跟來了
It is odd, but I feel almost...that my strange friend is with me.

787
01:15:24,090 --> 01:15:26,610
他在我的思緒中
He speaks to me in my thoughts.

788
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:30,090
與他在一起我最有活力
With him I felt more alive than ever I had.

789
01:15:30,530 --> 01:15:33,020
如今他不在,又將成婚
And now without him, soon to be a bride...

790
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:35,690
我深感困惑失落
I feel confused and lost.

791
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:39,530
也許我雖想做好,其實很壞
Perhaps, though I try to be good, I am bad.

792
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:43,200
或許我是個善變的壞女人
Perhaps I am a bad, inconstant woman.

793
01:16:02,330 --> 01:16:03,720
颶風！
Winds!

794
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:06,320
颶風！
Winds!

795
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:11,490
刮大風吧！
Winds!

796
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:16,060
就是這原因
It is the cause.

797
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:19,000
就是它
It is the cause of my soul!

798
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:21,170
天啊!德古拉
It is Dracula...

799
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:23,070
這個僵屍
the undead...

800
01:16:23,410 --> 01:16:26,280
我一生追擊的敵人
the foe I have pursued all my life.

801
01:16:30,690 --> 01:16:32,620
德古拉!
Dracula!

802
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:37,850
傑克,快有好多事要告訴你
Jack, hurry! I have much to tell you.

803
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:42,090
小心守候
Guard her well, Mr. Morris.

804
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:44,360
今晚不得失誤
Do not fail here tonight.

805
01:16:44,530 --> 01:16:49,860
我們對抗的是超越凡人的法力
We are dealing with forces beyond all human experience...an enormous power, so guard her well.

806
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:53,900
若不盡責你的露西將會成女妖
Otherwise your precious Lucy will become a bitch of the devil...

807
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:55,770
邪惡的魔女
a whore of darkness!

808
01:16:57,850 --> 01:16:59,370
老瘋子
You're a sick old buzzard.

809
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:02,780
聽清楚,小子
Hear me out, young man.

810
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:05,590
露西不是意外所致
Lucy is not a random victim attacked by mere accident.

811
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:07,250
明白了嗎?   不
Do you understand? No.

812
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:11,320
她自願受其蠱惑
She is a willing recruit, a breathless, wanton follower.

813
01:17:11,490 --> 01:17:13,890
忠實的門徒
I dare say, a devoted disciple.

814
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:16,550
她是魔鬼的姘婦
She is the devil's concubine!

815
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,660
懂了嗎
Do you understand me?

816
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:24,700
但我們仍可救回她的魂
Yet, we may still save her precious soul.

817
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:29,470
但...得先填飽肚子,傑克
But not on an empty stomach.

818
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:30,730
傑克  是的,先生
- Jack! - Here, sir.

819
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:34,010
我餓死了,快跟我去吃
I starve. Feed me.

820
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:36,210
老傻子！
You old coot!

821
01:19:51,310 --> 01:19:54,640
無能的人類跟愚蠢的驅邪物
Your impotent men with their foolish spells...

822
01:19:54,810 --> 01:19:58,370
保護不了你
cannot protect you from my power.

823
01:20:11,190 --> 01:20:13,990
我詛咒你成為僵屍
I condemn you to living death...

824
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:17,430
永遠
to eternal hunger...

825
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:22,270
嗜飲...鮮血
for living blood.

826
01:21:46,890 --> 01:21:47,880
傑克
Jack!

827
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:58,160
我知道你深愛她
I know how deeply you loved her.

828
01:21:58,370 --> 01:22:00,100
所以你得相信
That is why you must trust me and believe.

829
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:02,160
叫我如何相信?
Believe? How can I believe?

830
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:06,270
你在天黑前帶解剖刀來
I want you to bring me, before nightfall, a set of postmortem knives.

831
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:08,200
解剖?露西
An autopsy? Lucy?

832
01:22:08,380 --> 01:22:12,040
不算,我要割她的頭挖她的心
No, not exactly. I just want to cut off her head and take out her heart.

833
01:22:19,820 --> 01:22:22,450
9月17日,日記
Diary, 17th September.

834
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:24,320
可憐的強納生
Poor Jonathan.

835
01:22:24,660 --> 01:22:26,460
他仍重病
He's still so ill.

836
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:29,560
但回到倫敦他很開心
He's cheered by the familiar streets in London.

837
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,990
而我,因露西已死反而難過
For me, now that Lucy is dead, it is a sad homecoming.

838
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:38,000
仿佛部份的我也已死去
It is as if a part of me is dead too...

839
01:22:38,140 --> 01:22:40,900
除了暗盼
except for the tiny hope that lives in me...

840
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:43,570
能再見到我的王子
that I will again see my prince.

841
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:45,240
他在倫敦嗎?
Is he here?

842
01:22:46,350 --> 01:22:47,480
我已結婚,
Now that I am married...

843
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:51,590
才明白對縈繡山中的他
I begin to understand the nature of my feelings for my strange friend...

844
01:22:51,590 --> 01:22:53,920
是怎樣的情緒
who is always in my thoughts.

845
01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:07,100
強納生,怎麼了?
Jonathan, what is it?

846
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:09,170
就是他
It is the man himself.

847
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:11,430
他變年輕了
Look, he's grown young.

848
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,610
各位
Gentlemen,

849
01:23:57,750 --> 01:23:59,820
非掘露西的墓不可嗎?
must we desecrate poor Lucy's grave?

850
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:01,760
她死得夠慘了
She died horribly enough.

851
01:24:04,460 --> 01:24:07,690
若她已死則無礙
If Miss Lucy is dead, then no wrong can be done to her.

852
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:09,450
若沒死
But if she's not dead...

853
01:24:10,470 --> 01:24:12,700
你是說她被活埋?
What are you saying, man? That she's been buried alive?

854
01:24:13,230 --> 01:24:15,860
不,我只是說
No. All I say is

855
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:17,790
她沒死
she is undead.

856
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:20,130
沒死
Undead.

857
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:22,030
這真瘋狂
This is insane.

858
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:43,620
各位 動手吧
Gentlemen, shall we?

859
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:46,230
一、二、三
One, two, three.

860
01:25:03,590 --> 01:25:04,920
她呢?
Where is she?

861
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:08,410
她呢?
Where is she?

862
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,090
你把她怎麼了
What have you done with her?

863
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:17,430
她住在上帝恩典不及之處飄蕩在黑暗界
She lives beyond the grace of God...a wanderer in the outer darkness.

864
01:25:17,430 --> 01:25:20,230
她是吸血鬼
She is vampyre, nosferatu.

865
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:26,100
這些怪物被吸血後不會死
These creatures do not die like the bee after the first sting...

866
01:25:26,270 --> 01:25:29,270
反受傳染而成不朽
but instead grow strong and become immortal...once infected by another nosferatu.

867
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:36,340
所以,吾友
So my friends,

868
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:38,780
我們不是對抗一個怪物
we fight not one beast...

869
01:25:38,850 --> 01:25:43,850
而是長久流傳以血為生的族群
but legions that go on age after age after age...feeding on the blood of the living.

870
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:51,460
快躲起來
Quickly, hide. Now.

871
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:21,960
露西
Lucy!

872
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:23,090
露西
Lucy!

873
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:31,000
來,亞瑟
Come to me, Arthur.

874
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:35,340
扔下其它人,來我這裡
Leave these others and come to me.

875
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:40,280
我好想擁抱你
My arms are hungry for you, my darling.

876
01:26:41,420 --> 01:26:44,080
吻我,抱我
Kiss me and caress me...

877
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:46,580
我親愛的丈夫,我求你
my darling husband, please.

878
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:49,350
我們有十字架和聖水
We wave Christ and His holy blood!

879
01:26:49,660 --> 01:26:52,180
我們在主內堅強
We are strong in the Lord and

880
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:55,520
主賦與我們力量
the power of His might!

881
01:26:56,760 --> 01:27:00,360
主賦與我們力量
The power of God is upon us!

882
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:03,200
主賦與我們力量
The power of God is upon us!

883
01:27:05,010 --> 01:27:07,130
主賦與我們力量
The power of God is upon us!

884
01:27:10,810 --> 01:27:13,370
我將你帶至光明
I bring you from shadow into light!

885
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:18,110
黑暗王子,我將你逐至地獄
I cast you out, the prince of darkness...into hell!

886
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:23,760
只需片刻勇氣,
A moment's courage, and it is done.

887
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:25,690
左手拿鑿子
Take the stake in your left hand...

888
01:27:27,630 --> 01:27:29,560
對準心臟
place the point over the heart.

889
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,630
奉主之名,敲下去
Then in God's name, strike. Do it now!

890
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:54,080
吃呀,大餐
Eat, feast.

891
01:27:54,590 --> 01:27:57,250
將來你們需要力氣
You'll need your strength for the dark days ahead.

892
01:27:57,930 --> 01:27:58,920
米娜
Mina?

893
01:28:00,430 --> 01:28:01,590
博士 嗯?
- Doctor? - Ja?

894
01:28:03,330 --> 01:28:04,820
露西怎麼死的？
How did Lucy die?

895
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,290
這個...
Well...

896
01:28:11,110 --> 01:28:12,540
她死前痛苦嗎？
Was she in great pain?

897
01:28:12,940 --> 01:28:15,270
是的,我們砍掉她的頭
Ja, she was in great pain. Then we cut off her head...

898
01:28:15,610 --> 01:28:18,880
在心臟釘下十字架,她就安息了
and drove a stake through her heart and burned it and then she found peace.

899
01:28:19,010 --> 01:28:22,010
博士  拜託別說了
Doctor! Please.

900
01:28:25,950 --> 01:28:27,290
哈克先生
So, Mr. Harker...

901
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:31,020
身為你的醫生,問你個
I must now ask you, as your doctor...

902
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:35,390
敏感問題
a sensitive question.

903
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:39,560
你和那些怪物在一起時
During your infidelity with those creatures...those demonic women...

904
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:41,950
可曾吃過
did you, for one instant,

905
01:28:41,970 --> 01:28:43,300
她們的血
taste of their blood?

906
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:45,500
沒有
No!

907
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:50,510
沒有?
No?

908
01:28:51,710 --> 01:28:52,700
沒有
No!

909
01:28:55,150 --> 01:28:56,280
很好
Good!

910
01:28:56,780 --> 01:29:01,620
那你沒染上露西那種病
Then you have not infected your blood with the terrible...disease that destroyed poor Lucy.

911
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,660
博士,你要知道
Doctor, you must understand.

912
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,560
以前我疑幻似真
I doubted everything...

913
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:18,570
甚至以為自己瘋了
even my mind.

914
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:20,800
終日恐懼
I was impotent with fear.

915
01:29:21,310 --> 01:29:22,400
我知道  但是
- I know. - But, sir...

916
01:29:22,580 --> 01:29:27,470
我知道吸血鬼睡在哪
I know where the bastard sleeps.

917
01:29:27,650 --> 01:29:29,310
我把他帶到
I brought him there,

918
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:31,410
卡費教堂
to Carfax Abbey.

919
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:36,750
吸血鬼的確存在
Vampires do exist.

920
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:40,820
我們圍攻的這一個
And this one we fight, this one we face...

921
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:43,660
有二十人的力氣
has the strength of 20 or more people...

922
01:29:43,830 --> 01:29:45,890
你可以證明
and you can testify for that, Mr. Harker.

923
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:51,240
他能控制低等的蝙蝠、鼠狼
But he can also control the meaner things of life...the bat, the rodent, the wolf.

924
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:55,440
可化為煙霧遁形
He can appear as mist, as vapor, as fog and vanish at will.

925
01:29:56,580 --> 01:29:58,510
德古拉法力很大,
Now, all these things Dracula can do...

926
01:29:58,510 --> 01:30:00,180
但他不自由
but he is not free.

927
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:03,580
他必須躺在故土中增加魔力
He must rest in the sacred earth of his homeland to gain his evil power.

928
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:06,690
我們必須在此將他毀滅
It is here that we must find him and destroy him utterly.

929
01:30:07,590 --> 01:30:10,850
我替這個伯爵難過
I almost feel pity for anything so hunted as this count.

930
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:12,980
你怎會憐憫這種怪物
How can you pity such a creature?

931
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:16,290
我帶米娜去我的醫院
I'll take Mina to my quarters.

932
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:18,430
你在那兒才安全
Good. You'll be safer there.

933
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,100
子彈傷不了他,
Mr. Morris, your bullets will not harm him.

934
01:30:25,270 --> 01:30:27,540
一定得砍頭 我建議你用獵刀
He must be beheaded. I suggest you use your big bowie knife.

935
01:30:27,710 --> 01:30:30,700
我不打算貼近他,博士
Well, I wasn't plannin' on getting that close, Doc.

936
01:30:31,810 --> 01:30:33,210
主人！
Master!

937
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:36,380
主人
Master!

938
01:30:37,950 --> 01:30:39,350
主人...
Master!

939
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:51,730
傑克大夫
Dr. Jack!

940
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:55,660
我獲准得永生
I've been promised eternal life!

941
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:58,830
傑克
Dr. Seward,

942
01:30:58,910 --> 01:31:00,460
那人是誰
who is that man?

943
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:03,040
那是倫費先生,你不適合久留
Mr. Renfield. This is no place for you, Madam Mina.

944
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:06,640
倫費?我得見他
Renfield? I must see him.

945
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:08,970
倫費先生
Mr. Renfield,

946
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:10,980
別亂來
behave yourself.

947
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:15,260
這位是哈克太太
This is Mrs. Harker.

948
01:31:16,990 --> 01:31:18,250
晚安
Good evening.

949
01:31:18,430 --> 01:31:20,330
晚安,倫費先生
Good evening, Mr. Renfield.

950
01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:23,520
我太調皮了
It seems I've been rather naughty.

951
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:27,530
我認識你
I know you.

952
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,940
你是主人的新娘
You're the bride my master covets.

953
01:31:32,540 --> 01:31:34,770
我有丈夫了
I have a husband.

954
01:31:35,210 --> 01:31:36,870
我是哈克太太
I am Mrs. Harker.

955
01:31:38,210 --> 01:31:40,740
我的主人提過你
My master tells me about you.

956
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:43,610
他怎麼說?
What does he tell you?

957
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:46,450
說他要來
That he is coming.

958
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:50,010
他要來找你
That he is coming for you.

959
01:31:50,260 --> 01:31:53,190
過來點
Oh, please.

960
01:31:59,170 --> 01:32:01,190
別留在這
Don't stay here.

961
01:32:01,870 --> 01:32:04,360
離開這些人
Get away from these men,

962
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:05,970
求求你
please.

963
01:32:07,580 --> 01:32:11,310
我祈求主不要再見到你
And I pray to God I may never see your sweet face again.

964
01:32:15,150 --> 01:32:17,810
願主祝福保佑你
And may the Lord bless and keep you.

965
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:30,750
主人！
Master!

966
01:32:31,170 --> 01:32:32,500
主人
Master!

967
01:32:32,930 --> 01:32:35,600
你答應我讓我永生的
You promised me eternal life...

968
01:32:36,070 --> 01:32:38,770
你卻給了這名美女
but you give it to the pretty woman!

969
01:32:39,270 --> 01:32:40,600
傑克大夫
Dr. Jack!

970
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:43,330
我不是瘋子
I'm no lunatic man!

971
01:32:43,510 --> 01:32:46,410
我很正常,在為靈魂奮戰
I'm a sane man fighting for his soul!

972
01:32:46,610 --> 01:32:49,950
我的房間很簡陋,但很舒適
My quarters are spare, but I think you will find them comfortable.

973
01:32:50,950 --> 01:32:52,510
傑克大夫
Dr. Jack!

974
01:32:52,790 --> 01:32:55,350
有水和清潔用品
Water and toiletries at your disposal.

975
01:32:57,930 --> 01:33:00,090
你在這十分安全
You'll be completely safe here.

976
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:03,980
毀掉每個箱子
Destroy every box.

977
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:06,220
澆聖水
Sterilize the earth inside.

978
01:34:06,430 --> 01:34:07,920
讓他無處可逃
Leave him no refuge.

979
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:10,490
開始驅魔
Let the exorcism begin.

980
01:34:37,290 --> 01:34:38,620
倫費
Renfield.

981
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:42,720
你背叛了我
You have betrayed me.

982
01:34:44,330 --> 01:34:45,560
沒有
No.

983
01:34:47,130 --> 01:34:49,030
主人,我沒有
No, master.

984
01:34:50,670 --> 01:34:52,260
我沒有
No.

985
01:34:53,070 --> 01:34:54,910
我侍奉你
I serve you.

986
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:57,980
我只侍奉你
I serve only you.

987
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:58,240
吾愛
Oh, yes, my love.

988
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,430
你找到我了
You've found me.

989
01:36:04,780 --> 01:36:06,910
我最珍貴的生命
My most precious life.

990
01:36:07,350 --> 01:36:09,780
我要這事發生
I have wanted this to happen.

991
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:12,510
我都知道了
I know that now.

992
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:17,380
我要永遠和你在一起
I want to be with you always.

993
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:20,860
你不明白自己在說什麼
You cannot know what you are saying.

994
01:36:22,660 --> 01:36:24,720
是的
Yes...

995
01:36:24,870 --> 01:36:26,530
我知道
I do know.

996
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:43,150
我怕再也感受不到你的觸摸
I feared I would never feel your touch again.

997
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:45,750
我以為你死了
I thought you were dead.

998
01:36:52,990 --> 01:36:57,220
這軀殼裡沒有生命
There is no life in this body.

999
01:37:01,070 --> 01:37:02,730
但你活著
But you live.

1000
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:06,230
你是活的
You live.

1001
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:10,170
你到底是什麼?
What are you?

1002
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:15,010
我要知道 你一定得告訴我
I must know. You must tell me.

1003
01:37:22,190 --> 01:37:23,350
我...
I am...

1004
01:37:25,530 --> 01:37:26,860
什麼都不是
nothing.

1005
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:29,520
沒有生命
Lifeless.

1006
01:37:31,030 --> 01:37:32,360
沒有靈魂
Soulless.

1007
01:37:32,530 --> 01:37:33,930
什麼意思
What do you mean?

1008
01:37:34,170 --> 01:37:36,160
人皆恨我怕我
Hated and feared.

1009
01:37:37,470 --> 01:37:40,630
我在世上已死
I am dead to all the world.

1010
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:42,240
聽好
Hear me.

1011
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:46,040
我是
I am the monster...

1012
01:37:46,250 --> 01:37:49,150
眾人皆欲殺之的怪物
that breathing men would kill.

1013
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:52,620
我就是德古拉
I am Dracula.

1014
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:10,900
你殺死露西!
You murdered Lucy!

1015
01:38:12,740 --> 01:38:13,970
天啊
God!

1017
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:31,050
上帝 原諒我,我愛你

我要變得和你一樣
I want to be what you are...

1019
01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:56,650
見你所見,愛你所愛

1020
01:38:58,120 --> 01:38:59,240
米娜
Mina.

1021
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:02,150
想和我一樣
To walk with me...

1022
01:39:02,890 --> 01:39:06,120
你必須死亡
you must die to your breathing life...

1023
01:39:06,260 --> 01:39:08,270
在我的世界重生
and be reborn to mine.

1024
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:11,660
你永遠是我的愛
You are my love...

1025
01:39:12,930 --> 01:39:15,400
與生命
and my life always.

1026
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:24,400
那麼...
Then...

1027
01:39:25,180 --> 01:39:27,510
我將讓你永生
I give you life eternal...

1028
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:31,510
給你長久不息的愛

1029
01:39:33,190 --> 01:39:36,280
教你 呼風喚雨
the power of the storm...

1030
01:39:37,290 --> 01:39:39,620
降獸馴禽
and the beasts of the earth.

1031
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:42,420
跟我走
Walk with me...

1032
01:39:43,030 --> 01:39:47,090
永遠為我愛妻
to be my loving wife forever.

1033
01:39:47,270 --> 01:39:48,630
我願意
I will. Yes. Yes.

1034
01:40:20,870 --> 01:40:23,800
喝下去 同我邁入
Drink and join me...

1035
01:40:25,210 --> 01:40:27,200
永生
in eternal life.

1036
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:44,260
不,我不能害你
I cannot let this be.

1037
01:40:45,990 --> 01:40:48,620
我不在乎,佔有我吧
Please, I don't care. Make me yours.

1038
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:53,220
米娜,你將讓我永世
You will be cursed as I am to walk in the shadow of death...

1039
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:55,770
被詛咒
for all eternity.

1040
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:59,500
我太愛你
I love you too much...

1041
01:41:00,310 --> 01:41:01,600
而不能害你
to condemn you.

1042
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:06,970
帶我遠離死亡陰影
Then take me away from all this death.

1043
01:41:53,090 --> 01:41:54,420
米娜
Mina.

1044
01:42:04,570 --> 01:42:07,130
你以為十字架
You think you can destroy me...

1045
01:42:07,570 --> 01:42:09,740
可以殺死我?
with your idols?

1046
01:42:13,310 --> 01:42:15,510
拿聖水
Sacred blood of Christ!

1047
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:18,310
我服侍十字架
I, who served the cross.

1048
01:42:18,850 --> 01:42:21,180
在數百年前
I, who commanded nations...

1049
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:23,950
我曾領導萬軍
hundreds of years before you were born.

1050
01:42:24,290 --> 01:42:26,280
你的軍隊潰敗
Your armies were defeated.

1051
01:42:27,030 --> 01:42:28,360
你折磨...
You tortured and

1052
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:30,620
刑罰千萬人
impaled thousands of people.

1053
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:33,960
我被背棄
I was betrayed.

1054
01:42:34,230 --> 01:42:35,570
看...
Look

1055
01:42:35,700 --> 01:42:37,290
你的上帝
what your God...

1056
01:42:37,570 --> 01:42:39,970
如何對待我
has done to me.

1057
01:42:40,310 --> 01:42:44,040
你與上帝的戰爭已結束  伏法吧
No, your war with God is over. You must pay for your crimes.

1058
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:49,810
基督制伏你
Christ compels you!

1059
01:42:49,980 --> 01:42:51,920
現在她是...
She is now...

1060
01:42:53,550 --> 01:42:56,890
我的新娘了
my bride!

1061
01:43:01,730 --> 01:43:02,990
燈火
More light!

1062
01:43:05,130 --> 01:43:06,330
燈火
Light!

1063
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:08,660
不夠
More light!

1064
01:43:15,740 --> 01:43:18,840
好髒
Unclean.

1065
01:43:20,180 --> 01:43:21,170
捉住那些老鼠
- Get them! - This way!

1066
01:43:21,350 --> 01:43:22,710
得燒掉
- Get them! - They must be found.

1067
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:23,870
好髒
Unclean.

1068
01:43:24,550 --> 01:43:26,490
我們學到很多
We have learned something much.

1069
01:43:26,750 --> 01:43:28,480
德古拉怕我們
Dracula fears us.

1070
01:43:28,660 --> 01:43:30,210
他怕時間
He fears time.

1071
01:43:30,420 --> 01:43:33,220
否則何必匆匆逃走
For, if not, why does he hurry so?

1072
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:35,750
他走了
He is gone.

1073
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:38,000
你怎麼知道?
How do you know?

1074
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:41,430
他告訴我的
He speaks to me.

1075
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:45,500
他和你心靈相通
He has a strong mind connection to you.

1076
01:43:47,610 --> 01:43:50,540
他的心臟強壯,熬的住死亡
His heart was strong enough to survive the grave.

1077
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:53,810
你讚賞他
- You admire him. - Ja.

1078
01:43:55,820 --> 01:43:58,680
他生前是個偉人
He was, in life, a most remarkable man...

1079
01:43:59,690 --> 01:44:02,350
思慮恢宏
and his mind was great and powerful...

1080
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:05,460
但更重要的是
but greater is the necessity to stamp him out...

1081
01:44:05,630 --> 01:44:07,750
讓他永不超生
and destroy him utterly.

1082
01:44:08,660 --> 01:44:10,600
博士  嗯?
- Doctor? - Ja?

1083
01:44:13,730 --> 01:44:16,500
我知道我愈來愈像他
I know that I am becoming like him.

1084
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:19,970
你的救贖是他的毀滅
Your salvation is his destruction.

1085
01:44:21,070 --> 01:44:23,910
所以我要催眠你
That is why I want to hypnotize you.

1086
01:44:24,850 --> 01:44:27,250
我要你及時
I want you to help me find him before it is too late.

1087
01:44:27,750 --> 01:44:31,840
助我找到他  請幫我找到他
Please, help me find him. Please.

1088
01:44:32,650 --> 01:44:34,420
看這燭光
Look into this light...

1089
01:44:35,090 --> 01:44:37,850
光明中的光明
the light of all light, into this flame.

1090
01:44:39,090 --> 01:44:40,920
你雙眼沉重
Your eyes are heavy.

1091
01:44:42,530 --> 01:44:45,760
你想睡覺  睡吧
You want to sleep. Sleep now.

1092
01:44:48,470 --> 01:44:50,100
睡吧
Sleep.

1093
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:53,140
我要去找他,他在叫我
I must go to him.He calls.

1094
01:44:54,680 --> 01:44:56,010
你聽到什麼
What do you hear?

1095
01:44:58,510 --> 01:45:00,950
聽到什麼
What do you hear, child?

1096
01:45:02,050 --> 01:45:04,750
聽到什麼
What do you hear?

1097
01:45:05,950 --> 01:45:08,290
我的王子在呼喚我
Oh, my prince is calling me.

1098
01:45:08,790 --> 01:45:12,780
他飄洋過海
He is traveling across icy seas to his beloved home.

1099
01:45:13,590 --> 01:45:16,260
回家滋長力量
There he will grow strong again.

1100
01:45:16,860 --> 01:45:20,130
我要去找他分享他的力量
I am coming to him to partake of his strength.

1101
01:45:26,510 --> 01:45:31,070
我們當晚在波濤中航過英吉利海峽
We left London by train and crossed the English Channel in stormy seas...

1102
01:45:31,410 --> 01:45:34,400
風浪無疑是伯爵的傑作
no doubt from the passage of the count's ship.

1103
01:45:34,850 --> 01:45:36,750
他呼風喚雨
He commands the winds,

1104
01:45:36,950 --> 01:45:39,080
但我們仍占上風
but we still have the advantage.

1105
01:45:39,290 --> 01:45:42,850
搭火車三天內可抵達瓦納
By train, we can reach the Romanian port at Varna in three days.

1106
01:45:43,290 --> 01:45:45,550
搭船至少要一周
By ship, it will take him at least a week.

1107
01:45:47,030 --> 01:45:50,020
從巴黎經阿爾卑斯至布達佩斯
From Paris, we traveled through the Alps to Budapest.

1108
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:54,860
伯爵一定得經直布羅陀 我們已派人看守
The count must sail around the Rock of Gibraltar...where we have posted a lookout...

1109
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:57,700
至黑海瓦納港
and then on to the Black Sea port in Varna...

1110
01:45:57,870 --> 01:46:01,100
我們在瓦納與他碰頭將船燒毀
where we will meet his ship and burn it into the sea.

1111
01:46:07,350 --> 01:46:10,650
回家
Home. Home.

1112
01:46:20,390 --> 01:46:23,330
吸血鬼以血為她受洗
The vampire's baptized her with his own blood...

1113
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:25,160
她已成吸血鬼
and her blood is dying, my friend.

1114
01:46:25,830 --> 01:46:27,390
沒辦法了
It is no use.

1115
01:46:39,750 --> 01:46:42,840
我不讓你隻身入險地
I will not let you go into the unknown alone.

1116
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:47,450
可憐的強納生
Oh, my poor, dear Jonathan.

1117
01:46:47,650 --> 01:46:50,090
我對不起你
Oh, what have I done to you?

1118
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:54,850
不,是我害了我們倆
No, I have done this to both of us.

1119
01:46:55,030 --> 01:46:57,430
我聽到他了,他接近了

1120
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:59,830
他在呼喚我
He's calling me to him.

1121
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:02,870
米娜,米娜

1122
01:47:04,170 --> 01:47:05,600
留下來
Stay with me.

1123
01:47:05,740 --> 01:47:06,670
求求你

1124
01:47:06,910 --> 01:47:08,400
我好冷
I am so cold.

1125
01:47:21,050 --> 01:47:22,210
上車
All aboard!

1126
01:47:22,460 --> 01:47:26,650
正午,荷伍接到公司的電報

The count's ship sailed past us in the night fog...to the northern port of Galatz.

1128
01:47:31,570 --> 01:47:34,400
這個魔鬼在探索米娜的思想
The black devil is reading Mina's mind.

1129
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,990
怎麼捉他

1130
01:47:45,410 --> 01:47:46,400
瓦納港
Varna. Galatz.

1131

It's about 200 miles.I think that with the horses, we can cut him off...

1132
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:54,080
抵達古堡前攔截他

1133
01:47:54,250 --> 01:47:57,220

I will dispatch Van Helsing straight for the Borgo Pass.

1134
01:47:57,560 --> 01:47:59,020
若我們失敗,
If we fail in our task...

1135
01:47:59,030 --> 01:48:00,960
你一定得殺掉他

From Varna, Mina and Van Helsing took a carriage...

1137
01:48:09,170 --> 01:48:11,500
我們朝格拉茲前進
and we continued on the train towards Galatz...

1138
01:48:11,710 --> 01:48:15,270
希望能在他登陸前攔截到
where we still hoped to intercept the count before he reaches land.

1139
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:17,570
我為米娜害怕
I am fearful for Mina.

1140
01:48:17,780 --> 01:48:20,250
她是誘餌
She is now our decoy.

1141

1145
01:48:41,770 --> 01:48:42,530

1148
01:48:51,140 --> 01:48:53,480
德古拉又贏過我們
Dracula has outsmarted us again.

1149
01:48:53,610 --> 01:48:57,280
我們得知箱子在格拉茲被運走
We learned that his gypsies took charge of the vampire's box at Galatz...

1150
01:48:57,550 --> 01:49:00,110
已在波戈隘口的路上
and are now on the Borgo Pass road.

1151
01:49:17,070 --> 01:49:18,830
你一定得吃
Here. You must eat.

1152
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:20,530
我不餓
I am not hungry.

1153
01:49:24,210 --> 01:49:25,340
米娜
Mina!

1154
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:15,860
你對我很好,教授
You have been so good to me, Professor.

1155
01:50:25,310 --> 01:50:28,370
我知道露西暗戀你
I know that Lucy harbored secret desires for you.

1156
01:50:29,310 --> 01:50:30,780
她告訴我的
She told me.

1157
01:50:31,780 --> 01:50:34,440
我也知道男人要什麼
I, too, know what men desire.

1158
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:53,820
你會砍我頭
Will you cut off my head...

1159
01:50:53,900 --> 01:50:59,070
用十字架穿我的心嗎?你這兇手
and drive a stake through my heart...as you did poor Lucy, you murdering bastard?

1160
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:04,600
絕不會
Not while I live.

1161
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:06,510
我發誓要保護你
I am sworn to protect you.

1162
01:51:21,460 --> 01:51:22,450
不
No!

1163
01:51:23,900 --> 01:51:25,800
你在圈內很安全
You are safe within the circle.

1164
01:51:25,970 --> 01:51:27,370
我已輸掉露西
I've lost Lucy.

1165
01:51:27,630 --> 01:51:29,300
不能再將你輸給他
I'll not lose you to him.

1166
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:30,830
撒旦的臭婊子
You're whores of Satan!

1167
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:37,180
這裡是聖地
This is holy ground.

1168
01:51:37,340 --> 01:51:39,070
立刻走開
Leave this place now!

1169
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:42,410
走！
Leave!

1170
01:51:43,950 --> 01:51:46,720
奉主之名 離開這塊聖地
In the name of God, leave this ground!

1171
01:51:46,980 --> 01:51:49,210
我以基督的名義命令你們!
I command you in the name of Christ!

1172
01:51:53,890 --> 01:51:54,880
不...
No...

1173
01:51:56,830 --> 01:51:58,020
不...
No...

1174
01:52:00,770 --> 01:52:02,760
主啊!該死
Christ! Damn you!

1175
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:42,530
德古拉
Dracul!

1176
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:46,740
德古拉！
Dracul!

1177
01:53:19,310 --> 01:53:20,710
米娜
Mina!

1178
01:53:21,610 --> 01:53:26,050
你就在附近了
You are...near.

1179
01:53:26,050 --> 01:53:27,210
吾愛
My love.

1180
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:41,570
他們要在日落前趕到
They're racing against the sunset.

1181
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:43,560
也許已經來不及
It may be too late. God help us.

1182
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:16,890
米娜
Mina!

1183
01:54:25,380 --> 01:54:26,470
開槍
Harker, shoot!

1184
01:54:35,260 --> 01:54:36,520
攻呀
Charge!

1185
01:55:20,170 --> 01:55:21,220
昆西
Quincey!

1186
01:56:34,170 --> 01:56:34,900
不
No!

1187
01:56:41,310 --> 01:56:42,300
米娜
Mina!

1188
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:01,260
昆西
Quincey!

1189
01:57:05,810 --> 01:57:06,600
不
No!

1190
01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:12,140
不要
No!

1191
01:57:18,580 --> 01:57:21,250
當你要殺我時你下的了手嗎?
When my time comes, will you do the same to me?

1192
01:57:24,490 --> 01:57:25,480
你會嗎?
Will you?

1193
01:57:31,630 --> 01:57:33,670
不,放他們走
- Wait. - Let them go.

1194
01:57:33,670 --> 01:57:37,600
我們的工作到此為止
Let them go. Our work is finished here.

1195
01:57:38,100 --> 01:57:39,730
她的工作才剛開始
Hers has just begun.

1196
01:57:50,780 --> 01:57:51,580
昆西
Quincey.

1197
01:58:03,930 --> 01:58:06,420
我們都成了上帝的瘋子
We've all become God's madmen.

1198
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:10,630
我們都是
All of us.

1199
01:58:20,380 --> 01:58:22,370
我的上帝呢
Where is my God?

1200
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:27,150
他拋棄了我們
He has forsaken me.

1201
01:58:33,830 --> 01:58:35,820
結束了
It is finished.

1202
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:37,550
不
No.

1203
01:58:39,070 --> 01:58:40,400
吾愛
My love.

1204
01:58:45,510 --> 01:58:46,670
吾愛
My love.

1205
01:58:55,080 --> 01:58:56,740
在上帝面前
There, in the presence of God...

1206
01:58:57,620 --> 01:58:58,950
我終於瞭解
I understood at last how my love could release us all...

1207
01:58:59,120 --> 01:59:02,950
我的愛讓我們脫離黑暗魔咒
from the powers of darkness.

1208
01:59:09,130 --> 01:59:11,790
我們的愛比死更強大
Our love is stronger than death.

1209
01:59:19,810 --> 01:59:22,570
讓我安息
Give me peace.
