1
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,008
That's Juancho.

2
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,374
The house is huge.

3
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,676
Yeah, it wasn't this big
when I was a kid.

4
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:21,150
The last things they built
were the rooms upstairs

5
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,750
and in the back,
the sauna, Jacuzzi

6
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:26,581
the massage room.

7
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,650
- Wow! That's great!
- It's amazing. Very relaxing.

8
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:34,095
At one point my dad set up a spa

9
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,200
and a rehabilitation center
for smokers.

10
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,289
That's great.

11
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:41,635
Yeah, a group of people would
come here and stay for a week

12
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,969
and they'd stop smoking.

13
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:48,376
- A tennis court and pool.
- That's great!

14
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,470
Two of them came
on Saturday night...

15
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:54,449
Maxi, the blond, and Tomi.
They're sleeping there.

16
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,713
And there's Diego.

17
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,187
Fede! Is everything alright?

18
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,556
- What's up?
- I'm German. Nice to meet you.

19
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,526
How are you?
Did you sleep well?

20
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:09,828
Yeah, but I went to sleep late.
We stayed up late.

21
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:11,760
I was really stoned.

22
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:16,169
Lucho and Maxi were wasted.
We were laughing our heads off.

23
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:19,672
We ended up in the pool.

24
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:23,578
And Juan, who was wasted too,

25
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,246
threw Diego into the pool.

26
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:29,679
- No! He must've been pissed.
- Yeah, with his clothes on.

27
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:32,552
I think he even had
his cell phone on him.

28
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:34,522
No way!

29
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,755
Yeah, I think he did,
because of how pissed off he was.

30
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:41,531
Yeah, he was furious.
I went away.

31
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:43,835
I didn't want any trouble.

32
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,234
That's a typical day here.

33
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,235
Yeah, that's true.

34
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:50,004
Do you want mate or coffee?

35
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:54,174
I'm going to show him the room
and then we'll come downstairs.

36
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,007
Alright.

37
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:01,182
Hey, man, put on
some swim trunks or something.

38
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,752
This guy goes around naked all day.

39
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,219
Nice to meet you.

40
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,157
Hi, what's up?

41
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,732
- Hi, German.
- How are you? Diego.

42
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:18,123
Is everything alright?

43
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:21,071
I went to take a dump upstairs because
the other bathroom's full of puke.

44
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,002
There too?

45
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,939
Lucho threw up before going to sleep
and it's still there...

46
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,279
pieces of carrot and everything.

47
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:31,577
And I told you to come here
to relax for a few days,

48
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,719
but that doesn't seem to be the plan
for this weekend.

49
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:36,012
Did you come by train?

50
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:38,019
Yeah, the trip was amazing.
I loved it.

51
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:40,581
- Yeah, I came on that train too.
- I never came on that train.

52
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:41,919
- They say it's great.
- Yeah.

53
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:44,927
- Did you guys have breakfast?
- No, but Fede's making some mate.

54
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:47,122
I'm going to show him his room

55
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,891
and then we'll come down
for breakfast.

56
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,796
- Okay?
'Okay, great?

57
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,062
Thanks.

58
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,541
- What are you eating, Fatso?
- An egg. I was hungry.

59
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:13,674
What's up?

60
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:20,455
I just had an awesome lucid dream.

61
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,080
Yeah?

62
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:26,628
- What does "lucid" mean?
- That it's real. It's very real.

63
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,265
What did you dream?

64
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:32,398
I was in Tigre, at my sister's house,

65
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,238
next to the river.

66
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:39,467
I don't know what I was doing,
or who I was with, but I was there.

67
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:43,101
And?

68
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:47,683
Everything was the same,
the house, the grill in the backyard.

69
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:51,348
I don't know why I went inside
and went up the stairs.

70
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,385
I went up three floors.

71
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,824
But I think
it's a one-story house.

72
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:01,028
- What?
- I think it's a one-story house.

73
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,161
And when I got to the terrace,

74
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,896
the water was at the level
of the balcony.

75
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:11,067
There was a lot of water.

76
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,906
It was as if there were a waterfall
a hundred yards away.

77
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,035
Yeah.

78
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,040
But I had gone up two floors

79
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:22,676
so there couldn't be water
on both levels,

80
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,216
So then I realized it was a dream.

81
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:31,729
And whenever I realize that,
I feel like having sex...

82
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:37,592
so I started walking,
knowing I could wake up any minute.

83
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,634
I passed a bridge.

84
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:43,807
I went inside this place with bars,
like a nightclub.

85
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:47,003
And I started making out
with the first chick I saw.

86
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,166
I took off her clothes,

87
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:51,213
I started sucking her tits
and her pussy really hard.

88
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:56,012
And the chick just stood there.

89
00:07:56,376 --> 00:08:00,051
You know like in dreams when
the characters suddenly stop moving?

90
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,159
- Yeah, that's weird.
- Yeah.

91
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:06,892
And at one point,
her pussy started getting sandy...

92
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,533
and... bam! I got up.

93
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:12,466
I opened my eyes and looked at
the ceiling. I thought "Damn it!"

94
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,199
But it was cool while it lasted.

95
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:16,739
The part about the sand
freaked me out.

96
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:17,764
Yeah.

97
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:25,083
But it was so real
that I can still taste her pussy.

98
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:28,975
- Sweet!
- It was really pink and delicious!

99
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:33,421
- We have to call some girls over.
- We need it, huh?

100
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:34,546
Yeah.

101
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,086
Alright.

102
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,035
- Mario Bros isn't a cartoon, man.
- Yeah it is.

103
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:53,542
No, man, that's what
you didn't get yesterday.

104
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,713
Mario Bros isn't a cartoon.

105
00:08:55,835 --> 00:09:00,511
You guys said it was
and I said it wasn't.

106
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,550
That's why I think I didn't lose.

107
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:05,244
Did you used to watch
Mario Bros cartoons?

108
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:08,451
It's the same thing.
It's like a cartoon.

109
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:11,562
You just can't admit that you lost
because you couldn't guess

110
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:15,155
and now you're saying that if we
had told you it wasn't a cartoon,

111
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,597
you would've guessed,

112
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,192
and then you would've said
that it's a kind of cartoon.

113
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,565
Come on, Diego. I know you!

114
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,172
See how competitive you are?

115
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:25,935
I couldn't care less!
You're the one who's competitive!

116
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:30,103
I hate it when people mix up
the actors, the people,

117
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:31,646
with characters.

118
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:34,182
One time Fatso got Jack Sparrow

119
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,318
and when he asked if it was an actor,
you said yes.

120
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,117
No! The actor's Johnny Depp.

121
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,088
Jack Sparrow worked as a pirate.

122
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:41,658
- "Worked as a pirate"?
- Yeah!

123
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,783
Now being a pirate's a job.

124
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:47,155
I hate it when you don't understand
the example. It pisses me off.

125
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,355
You're so competitive.

126
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,220
Come on, Diego!

127
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,109
Hey, Fatso, have you seen Fer?

128
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,584
Fatso!

129
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:05,767
The chick flirts with me
when we're all working...

130
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,573
and then she plays hard-to-get.

131
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:14,411
- I mean...
- Like how?

132
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,214
We were going to Pablo's house.
You know the guy with long hair?

133
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,310
Yeah.

134
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,721
Okay, Pablo, Agus, the chick and me.

135
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,659
Pablo and Agus went
to buy some beer

136
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:26,062
and the girl and I were alone.

137
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:31,124
I sat next to her because
she wanted to show me a message

138
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,328
and the girl gave me
the cold shoulder.

139
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:36,940
She was cold as ice.
She went to the bathroom.

140
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,166
She always act like that,
hysterical.

141
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:43,474
The next day at work,
in front of everyone,

142
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:47,710
she walked in, kissed me here
and gave me a neck massage.

143
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:49,775
She always does the same thing.

144
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,922
She's crazy.

145
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,580
Forget about her.

146
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:54,846
Yeah.

147
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:59,360
- Have you guys seen Fer?
- No.

148
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,334
So?

149
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:10,831
Are you sure the girl doesn't
know you're in a relationship?

150
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:13,978
No, man, I'm sure.

151
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,704
Girls find out about those things.

152
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:20,580
There's no way she could know.
And I don't think the guys told her,

153
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:22,782
because they know
I want to screw her...

154
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,185
Right.

155
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,990
- It's okay.
- Yeah.

156
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,198
But you have a girlfriend.

157
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,993
To each his own.

158
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,364
- I found this one.
- Yeah.

159
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,892
But it's almost empty.

160
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,901
The mosquitoes are killing me.

161
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:19,435
Here you go...

162
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:22,069
As soon as I came in
they started to bite me too.

163
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,209
They bit you all over!

164
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,784
Look here...

165
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:29,910
No way, man!

166
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,983
They bit me all over!

167
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,419
Here...

168
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,013
Here...

169
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,049
And here too.

170
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,596
As I was saying...

171
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:48,796
Diego and Juan the longest.

172
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,737
I've them since we were
in kindergarten.

173
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:54,038
But we're all very good friends.

174
00:13:56,902 --> 00:14:00,213
We met the rest later on.

175
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:05,550
In primary school, we met Lucho,
Leo and Tomi.

176
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:14,045
And Maxi used to go out
with Tomi's sister.

177
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,264
He used to play soccer with us
all the time,

178
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,269
so we started getting along
really well with him.

179
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:23,602
And we met Fatso in eleventh grade.

180
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:27,438
I think he had failed five
or six times. We lost track.

181
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,544
Yeah, you can tell he's older.

182
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:32,548
And you're not going to meet
Santiago today,

183
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:37,951
because he moved to Spain
when he met a Spanish girl here.

184
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:41,158
He used to come back
every two or three months,

185
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:45,962
but then he started coming here
less frequently.

186
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:51,598
I don't think he'd come back now,

187
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,405
if he didn't come back
two years ago.

188
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:56,766
Leo...

189
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:58,133
Hi.

190
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,597
Well, I'm going to the pool.

191
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,963
You do karate with Fer, right?

192
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:02,572
It's not karate, you idiot.

193
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,573
- It's the same thing.
- It's not the same thing.

194
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:08,101
Yeah, I used to do karate,
but when I moved to Adrogué,

195
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:11,681
I started doing taekwondo,
because that's all they had there.

196
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:16,516
I did it to do some kind of sport.

197
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:21,483
I don't like it that much.
I don't have a belt or anything.

198
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,891
I don't know if I'm going to
get different color belts.

199
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,988
You work at the pool bar
at San Martin Square, right?

200
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,188
Yeah.

201
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:30,832
We saw you there one day
with Fer, right?

202
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:32,563
Yeah, actually,
that's where we met.

203
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,227
We started talking a lot

204
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:37,672
and he told me
to try out the club,

205
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,638
so we became friends.

206
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,070
Are you studying anything?

207
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,944
I used to study architecture
and I dropped out.

208
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,345
- Where?
- In La Plata.

209
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:47,246
- Nice!
- Yeah, I liked it...

210
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,249
I like to draw,

211
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:53,187
but I'd rather draw things
like comic book illustrations...

212
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,054
Real drawings.

213
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:59,888
So anyway...
I'd love to draw for a living.

214
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:03,429
But it's very hard
to find the right connections.

215
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:06,162
- Fer has a big comic book collection.
- Yeah.

216
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,435
Have you guys seen it?
It's huge!

217
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:08,631
Yeah.

218
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:13,442
- Should I roll a blunt?
- Please.

219
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,545
Yeah, okay.

220
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:40,353
Hey, what's up?
Is everything alright?

221
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:41,760
Yeah.

222
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:14,197
THE CATCHER IN THE RYE

223
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,370
Are you enjoying it?

224
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:33,209
It's awesome.

225
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:36,482
He's a great writer.

226
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,220
Yeah, he is.

227
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,167
What are you doing, man?

228
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,842
Lucho, you were a total chicken!

229
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:09,044
I'd be scared of Fatso too.

230
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:15,352
Yeah, man, stop overdoing it.
It's not a World Cup.

231
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:16,959
You kick too hard.

232
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:21,895
I said I'm not gonna beat you up
because you're weak,

233
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:26,135
but if you keep bothering me,
I'll beat the crap outta you.

234
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:28,492
So are your friends coming here
on Saturday or not?

235
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:31,234
You always act like you're faithful,

236
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:34,171
but you're dying
to meet those girls. What the hell?

237
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:35,471
You're So gay!

238
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,343
Shut up!

239
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:40,643
Don't be gay!

240
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,917
I just want some eye candy,
that's all.

241
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:45,818
But are they coming?

242
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:49,891
When they saw there were
eight of us, they left early.

243
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:53,656
Well, Maca said
she wasn't coming,

244
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:57,928
but if we throw a party,
she'll come with more friends.

245
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,136
The other day,
it was eight of us against four.

246
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,272
There can't be two of us for each.

247
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:05,638
It's not like
we're going to make porn.

248
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,609
- But Juan screwed one of them.
- Yeah.

249
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,873
They're no prudes.

250
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,843
I didn't screw the other one
because she knows I have a girlfriend,

251
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:15,681
otherwise, I would've done it.

252
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,377
Totally.

253
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,726
- Did you buy chocolate milk?
- Yeah.

254
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:27,653
Hey, German,
are you in a relationship?

255
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,089
He's Fer's boyfriend.

256
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:31,592
Are you jealous,
you cocksucking pussy?

257
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:33,653
No, I'm single.

258
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:35,831
If I looked like Brad Pitt

259
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:38,731
and girls hit on me
like they probably hit on this guy,

260
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:41,530
I wouldn't stop fooling around
until I'm in my forties

261
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,140
and then I'd start thinking
about a relationship.

262
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:47,073
You always want a girlfriend
to cheat on her with sluts.

263
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,240
The only faithful guy here
is Tomas.

264
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:52,713
I'm pretty faithful too, man.

265
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,715
Yeah, right.

266
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:58,144
It's not like girls are
faithful either.

267
00:22:58,277 --> 00:22:59,585
I don't believe that at all.

268
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:03,626
Of course not.
They're just like us, or worse.

269
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,489
They're just really sly.

270
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:08,257
They get away with it
and you never find out.

271
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:30,017
I don't know what's up with the guy.

272
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,886
What I do know is that
he doesn't have a girlfriend.

273
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:40,292
I'm not making it up, man.

274
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:43,894
Why did he invite me?

275
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:49,968
I don't know.

276
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:57,111
Your head would explode
if you were here.

277
00:23:57,135 --> 00:24:00,116
They walk around naked all the time.

278
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:07,116
Hey, today they asked me
if I was in a relationship...

279
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:09,521
and I said no.

280
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:13,754
No, man. I didn't lie.

281
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,627
They didn't ask me
if I had a girlfriend.

282
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,564
No, I didn't lie.

283
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:22,862
And Fer was just listening.

284
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:28,044
Are you stupid?

285
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,009
Fer's the guy.

286
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:34,442
If some chicks come here
and he screws one of them,

287
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:35,950
I'll just die.

288
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:41,917
Yeah.

289
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:53,270
I don't know.
I'm just going to stay here.

290
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:57,229
I'm going to play dumb for a while
and see what he does.

291
00:24:58,096 --> 00:24:59,200
I don't know.

292
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:05,579
You're so stupid.

293
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:07,549
<i>Okay, bye. bye.</i>

294
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,040
Bye.

295
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:01,894
Hi.

296
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,537
- How are you?
- Fine.

297
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:04,402
Great.

298
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:07,443
Sorry to bother you,
but I'm about to make a barbecue

299
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,137
and we don't have any newspapers.

300
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,612
- Do you have any?
- Yeah, I'm sure we have some.

301
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:13,081
- I'll bring you some.
- Thanks.

302
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,138
- Hi.
- Hi.

303
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:14,707
Hi.

304
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,840
Hi.

305
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:18,045
- Hi.
- Hi.

306
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,548
- How are you?
- Fine.

307
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:26,254
- There are so many of you.
- Yeah.

308
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:36,062
- Nice weather, huh?
- Yeah.

309
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,838
How are the girls?

310
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,812
Fine.

311
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:48,417
You should make them wear
sunscreen. The sun's really burning.

312
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:51,613
Yeah, I know.
But they're inside right now,

313
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,584
otherwise they can't
get to sleep at night.

314
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:57,556
There he is.

315
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:05,362
- Is this enough?
- Yeah, this is great.

316
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:06,935
- Yeah?
- Thanks.

317
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:09,027
If you need more,
just let us know.

318
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:10,538
- Okay, thanks.
- Bye.

319
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,664
'Bye, guys!
'Bye-bye.

320
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:20,545
She was cute!

321
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,046
Really cute!

322
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,185
You voted for the wrong guy,
admit it.

323
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,885
I don't know.
I have no idea about politics.

324
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,819
I shouldn't have even told you.

325
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:34,693
If you have no idea,
you should go and ask.

326
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,559
I'm not saying you have
to understand,

327
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:41,697
but you're old enough
to not vote for just anyone.

328
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:45,236
You're not choosing
where you're going to go on vacation.

329
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:46,363
Right?

330
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:50,303
There's a whole bunch
of stuff at play.

331
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:55,950
You should've asked me about it,
or your dad.

332
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,121
Well, not your dad...

333
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:01,823
But you should've asked around
a little,

334
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,985
so at least you know
what you're voting for.

335
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:09,257
Or would you screw a girl
without a condom

336
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:12,833
just because she says
she's on the pill?

337
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:14,995
It depends how hot she is.

338
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,437
- But that's a bad example.
- Why?

339
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:22,875
Because you supposedly
trust the girl.

340
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:24,708
You don't think
she's gonna lie to you.

341
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:27,140
But if you vote for the wrong person,

342
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:28,751
you end up taking it up the butt.

343
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:30,384
They say they're gonna give you
a back massage

344
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:31,919
and they end up sticking it
up your butt.

345
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:33,454
If they stick it up your butt,
at least it should be

346
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:35,480
because you want to feel it inside.

347
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,766
Hey, you really look Argentinian.

348
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,067
What do you mean?

349
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:52,171
- What do you look like?
- Spanish.

350
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:53,874
And me?

351
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:57,579
French. All you need
is a beret and a paintbrush.

352
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,945
What about me?

353
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,983
Italian.

354
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:05,452
Fatso looks Russian.

355
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:07,820
Tomas looks Arabian.

356
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:11,084
Leo looks German
and Diego looks Swedish.

357
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,836
What do I look like?

358
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:35,282
You look English.

359
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:37,683
You look like
an English soccer player.

360
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:49,362
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

361
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:52,195
eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,

362
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:54,735
seventeen, eighteen, nineteen,
twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two,

363
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:57,262
twenty-three, twenty-four,
twenty-five,

364
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:58,915
twenty-six, twenty-seven,
twenty-eight,

365
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,567
twenty-nine, thirty!

366
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:02,427
What's the matter with you?
You're always cheating!

367
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,908
- What happened?
- Did you hear that?

368
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:08,542
You're always cheating, man!

369
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,246
You can't play like that!

370
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:12,944
Stop!

371
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:14,677
Stop it, Leo!

372
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:16,745
You moron!

373
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:18,748
Who are you calling a moron?

374
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:23,286
He's an idiot! He keeps cheating!
I can't play like this!

375
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:25,395
- Stop it, Leo.
- Relax...

376
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:26,962
Stop it!

377
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:29,292
Stop, Leo!

378
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:31,927
It's not a championship.
You get too worked up.

379
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:34,060
They why are we playing?

380
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:36,772
Take it easy! And you too!

381
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:56,153
I'm gonna score.

382
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:14,106
Pass the blunt, man.
You're smoking it all by yourself.

383
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:16,305
Don't get upset, man.

384
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,679
We were just playing
and you got really pissed off!

385
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:22,583
But if we're playing and you cheat,
it sucks. You can't do that!

386
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:25,654
- Stop being such a pussy!
- What are you talking about, asshole?

387
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,720
We were just fooling around
for a while!

388
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:31,417
- You're a jerk, man.
- Go fuck yourself!

389
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:37,796
Let me have some.

390
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:44,968
Mother fucker...

391
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,514
Milo Manara.

392
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:30,786
Milo Manara?

393
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:32,452
Don't you know him?

394
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:35,415
He's an Italian...

395
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:41,755
A genius. My dad had
a bunch of his comic books.

396
00:33:42,554 --> 00:33:46,866
I know the classic ones more,
the American ones.

397
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:48,993
- Like this one.
- Yeah.

398
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:57,244
My dad had all of Manara's
comic books and Fierro's.

399
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:58,914
That's cool.

400
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:03,679
I used to take them from my dad
when I was a kid, because...

401
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:08,417
there were naked people in them.
They would really turn me on.

402
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:12,852
At first I thought Milo Manara
was the name of the main character,

403
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:18,090
but when I was older I realized
it was the name of the artist.

404
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:22,101
Actually, "Click"
is his most well-known comic...

405
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:23,900
Well the one I know the best.

406
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:30,410
It was about a guy who had put
a device in a girl...

407
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:33,776
and he'd click a remote control
that would make her have orgasms.

408
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:36,742
He'd click it
and she'd have an orgasm.

409
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:40,084
And he'd spy on her. It was amazing.

410
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:41,721
It blew your mind.

411
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:45,055
Actually, I should ask my dad for it
and read it again,

412
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,561
It's crazy... crazy.

413
00:34:54,125 --> 00:35:01,839
When I was in school,
I used to draw a lot of superheroes.

414
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:08,176
One day, some friends of mine
made a magazine.

415
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,780
It was a school magazine...

416
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:16,547
It was a magazine for the school,
like an alternative magazine.

417
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:17,681
Yeah.

418
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:23,866
And one day they asked me to do
a two-page comic.

419
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:25,859
I had to do everything...

420
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:29,961
The drawings, the dialogs...

421
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:31,938
The whole comic, you know?

422
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,806
- And did they publish it?
- Yeah.

423
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,737
- That's cool!
- Yeah, really cool.

424
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:38,437
To see your work published.

425
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:42,844
Yeah. And what I would do was...

426
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:46,511
I used to use
other people's material a little...

427
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:51,224
Actually, I mostly adapted
story lines from short stories,

428
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:52,759
like Cortazar's.

429
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:54,359
Cool!

430
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:57,830
It was cool, because
they were superheroes,

431
00:35:57,956 --> 00:36:01,563
but with a more surrealist style...

432
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:04,104
Like the characters' background.

433
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:06,708
Yeah, it was like a dream.
It was cool.

434
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:08,575
Amazing.

435
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,781
Do you want to go to sleep?

436
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:20,822
Yeah... Okay.

437
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:27,061
Hey, Leo...

438
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:30,163
Leo...

439
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:35,198
Come on, Leo. Go to your bed.

440
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:39,005
Come on, Leo.

441
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,937
This guy always does the same thing.

442
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:47,683
Okay, I'll go sleep downstairs.

443
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:51,988
- See you tomorrow.
- Alright.

444
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:38,656
Guada?

445
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:41,693
- Yeah.
- What's the matter?

446
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:44,632
She wants me to go with her
to the party,

447
00:38:46,224 --> 00:38:47,999
But that's not it. I know her.

448
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:49,330
She's jealous.

449
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:53,405
She asked me if there were
any girls here.

450
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:56,443
She doesn't believe me when
I say that no girls came over,

451
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:59,471
none of your friends.

452
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:04,345
We spent two great weeks
in Ostende,

453
00:39:05,243 --> 00:39:08,281
but now she doesn't understand
that I want to be with you guys.

454
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:10,949
It's not that I don't want
to be with her.

455
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:15,957
She's great. You know her.
She's really sweet,

456
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:18,860
but she can be really insecure

457
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:23,399
and it gets on my nerves.

458
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:32,072
I know I have my flaws,

459
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:35,515
but I don't get jealous.

460
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:43,719
You shouldn't pay attention to her.

461
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:49,855
It's her problem, man.

462
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:53,665
Let her figure it out,
even if it hurts.

463
00:39:56,761 --> 00:40:00,299
What are you going to do?
Go back to Buenos Aires?

464
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:04,071
You're going to get upset
and you won't be able to relax.

465
00:40:04,202 --> 00:40:06,682
Because you're fine here with us.

466
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:13,777
So you're going to be pissed off
and you guys are going to fight.

467
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:16,346
Tomi...

468
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:19,050
Forget it.

469
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:22,264
Don't forget that you met her
when you were with Lucia.

470
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:26,824
So it's natural
that she'd be scared and insecure.

471
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:29,870
Yeah, I know that, but...

472
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:33,101
I really love her.

473
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:36,611
I'd die if I couldn't be with her.

474
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:59,590
Hey, man...

475
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:02,100
German's pretty weird.

476
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:07,201
I just went into Fer's room
and he was going through his bag.

477
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:14,572
I can't believe you, man.
You're always making things up.

478
00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:19,989
Fernando and that guy have been
training together all year.

479
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:23,418
Fer told me he really trusts him.

480
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:29,164
You're just a cocksucker,
that's the problem.

481
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:32,131
So you make things up.
I know you.

482
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:38,803
Look at Diego
going through my bag.

483
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:40,671
Is this your bag?

484
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,739
Hey, what T-shirts did you bring?

485
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,241
Can I borrow one?

486
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:54,149
But give it back to me later.

487
00:41:54,779 --> 00:41:57,316
The other day you were wearing
a sweatshirt of mine

488
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:59,168
that I had been looking for
for a long time.

489
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:00,820
Yeah, laugh all you want.
It's true.

490
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:02,931
I just love your clothes.

491
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:07,535
Okay, stop looking through
my stuff. I'll show you.

492
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:10,731
- Alright, alright!
- Don't go through everything.

493
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:12,908
- Alright...
- I don't like it.

494
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,538
There you go.

495
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:15,665
Thanks.

496
00:42:29,814 --> 00:42:32,317
It's really hard for me
not to get upset.

497
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,230
No one's faster than him, man!

498
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:37,055
The guy's effective.

499
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:41,767
He doesn't have to make
any fancy moves.

500
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:45,702
They guy's straightforward.
He's simple.

501
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:46,934
That's why he's the best.

502
00:42:47,098 --> 00:42:50,636
Yeah, but you used to say
that Maradona was the best

503
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:53,248
and now because you read
a couple of interviews...

504
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:56,011
Yeah, I did read a couple
of interviews,

505
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,642
but I've also watched him

506
00:42:57,775 --> 00:43:03,054
and he doesn't put on a show
for the cameras like the rest.

507
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:07,459
He's simple and quick

508
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:09,531
and it's also a generational thing.

509
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:11,825
Times have changed.

510
00:43:12,223 --> 00:43:17,536
And I don't agree with the idiots
who say he scores goals abroad

511
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:19,436
- and here he sucks.
- Yeah, well.

512
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:21,703
People who say that are idiots.

513
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:23,237
Don't you think?

514
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,577
- The guys are here with pastries.
- Awesome!

515
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:29,485
- How are you guys?
- Cool!

516
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:32,353
What's up, guys?

517
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:36,757
You wouldn't believe the accident
there was around the corner.

518
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:37,814
- It's awful.
- Really?

519
00:43:37,882 --> 00:43:38,882
Yeah, yeah.

520
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:40,995
- What happened?
- A crash.

521
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,757
Hey, Fer,
where are we going tomorrow?

522
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:47,369
I don't know.
Wherever you guys want?

523
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:51,303
We could go to that nightclub
with the pool in the middle

524
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:53,636
that the guy fell into
with all his clothes on.

525
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:56,307
Otherwise,
we can go to the capital

526
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,277
and come back at night.

527
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:00,382
Are you crazy? You want us
to go to the capital?

528
00:44:00,538 --> 00:44:01,676
Let's go somewhere nearer,

529
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:03,581
otherwise Fer and Leo
won't be able to drive,

530
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:05,312
they won't be able
to drink anything.

531
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:08,822
Do you want us to come back
wasted like the other day,

532
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:10,826
when we almost
got ourselves killed?

533
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:13,584
Hey, I'm not dangerous.

534
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:15,595
I don't drink anymore.

535
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:20,162
Yeah, right.

536
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:30,376
Hey, man,
this meat's like butter.

537
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:32,277
Don't you think?

538
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:33,880
The other day, Diego and I
bought meat at the supermarket

539
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:35,611
and it wasn't like this at all.

540
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:37,079
This is totally different.

541
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:38,346
Yeah.

542
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:41,916
And you ate three sausages,
you cocksucker. You must be full.

543
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:44,615
That butt sure imports
a lot of meat.

544
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:47,855
He gave it to me, you idiot.

545
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:51,262
You're the weirdest
vegetarian I know.

546
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:54,262
You never eat meat;
you're always really fussy,

547
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:55,836
but you eat barbecue.

548
00:44:55,926 --> 00:44:58,372
But I never say I don't eat meat.

549
00:44:58,496 --> 00:45:01,272
I don't go around telling people
that I'm vegetarian.

550
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:03,639
But it's true.
I hardly ever eat meat.

551
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:05,542
Only when there's barbecue.

552
00:45:05,603 --> 00:45:09,107
<i>The other day, Redo and X
went to a restaurant</i>

553
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:10,718
and we ordered meat.

554
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:14,119
But you bother me so much about it.

555
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:18,088
I can eat meat
whenever I feel like it.

556
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:22,964
So does you girlfriend
eat your meat?

557
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,328
Of course she does.

558
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:25,923
She eats it whole.

559
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:29,197
What about you? You should
probably get a girlfriend too.

560
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,600
How long has it been
since this guy had sex?

561
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:34,400
Like four months.

562
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:38,609
You can't get a girl
to save your life.

563
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:41,008
You don't have to be so mean.

564
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:02,134
Today's December 6,
my mom's birthday.

565
00:46:02,393 --> 00:46:03,838
I have to call her.

566
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:13,071
Lucho's always teasing Leo,
you know?

567
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:16,303
Do you think Leo's really gay?

568
00:47:17,468 --> 00:47:19,004
I don't know.

569
00:47:19,637 --> 00:47:20,741
Maybe.

570
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:25,250
The guy's weird.
He's always been weird.

571
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:30,416
The two girlfriends he had were
the only chicks he's ever screwed.

572
00:47:30,814 --> 00:47:36,321
Plus, sometimes he just stares
at you. It's weird.

573
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:40,334
And you don't know
if he's looking at you, at him...

574
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:42,960
or if he likes you.
I don't know. That's what I think.

575
00:47:43,127 --> 00:47:44,765
Yeah, yeah. I agree.

576
00:47:47,398 --> 00:47:49,935
I don't know. It's also weird
that his two girlfriends

577
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:52,673
are the only girls
he's ever screwed.

578
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,307
Now he's with this chick, Rocio...

579
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:58,711
but Rocio used to go out
with Mono

580
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:02,688
and Mono says
she never wanted to have sex.

581
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:05,054
So I don't know.

582
00:48:06,417 --> 00:48:08,727
- I have an aunt who's a lesbian.
- Yeah.

583
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,367
She says that
if you're really bisexual,

584
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:15,433
you have no trouble
repressing yourself,

585
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:17,970
because since you like
girls and guys,

586
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:20,302
if you meet a guy,
it doesn't matter,

587
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:23,345
you can be with him and then go
satisfy your needs with a chick.

588
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:26,311
It's no big deal.
It's easy to repress.

589
00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:28,346
So you just leave him there
and that's it.

590
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:30,881
He's going to be the first
to get married,

591
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:33,113
- whether he's gay or not.
- Yeah, maybe.

592
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:36,750
And we're going to be there
celebrating it with presents,

593
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:38,790
dancing at his wedding.

594
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:41,792
It's true.

595
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:07,585
You know I love Romi...

596
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:11,883
but I can't say no to girls
who call me for sex.

597
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:16,921
The other day, Romi had to
get some paperwork done.

598
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:18,533
She went to sleep at her house

599
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:22,831
because it was closer
to where she had to go the next day.

600
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:26,433
It's like she's a witch.

601
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:31,205
I don't know if this girl
is psychic or what...

602
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:34,645
Natalia texted me.
Remember Natalia, the skinny girl?

603
00:49:34,772 --> 00:49:38,413
Remember? The skinny girl?

604
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:40,419
You wouldn't believe
what she looks like now.

605
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:43,582
She's got a lot more meat
on her bones and a great rack.

606
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:47,217
Man! I took a cab
and went to her house

607
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:50,863
and we fucked for nine hours.

608
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:53,565
Of course.
What was I supposed to do?

609
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:56,068
It's natural.

610
00:49:56,226 --> 00:49:59,400
Then I got home
and took a shower...

611
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:01,667
and I felt like shit.

612
00:50:01,899 --> 00:50:04,038
I felt really guilty.

613
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:06,839
It sucks.

614
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:12,853
The important thing
is that Romi doesn't catch you,

615
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:16,083
because then
you'll want to kill yourself.

616
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:43,247
Hey, I think German is kind of gay.

617
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:48,081
You'd know if he was for sure.
It takes one to know one.

618
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:51,592
Stop it, man. Hey...

619
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:53,560
You keep calling me "cocksucker"
all day long.

620
00:50:53,584 --> 00:50:55,188
"Cocksucker, cocksucker,
cocksucker."

621
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:57,390
You don't realize it,
but it gets annoying.

622
00:50:57,688 --> 00:50:59,326
I'm sick of it.

623
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:01,967
Plus, I have a girlfriend.

624
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:05,433
You don't realize
I'm just kidding around.

625
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:09,640
Hey, stop! I was here first!

626
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:27,152
Diego, I'm gonna use your shampoo;
it's great!

627
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:28,422
Okay.

628
00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:55,957
Fer, I'm going to take a shower here,

629
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:59,050
because Lucho's using the shower
downstairs and he takes an hour.

630
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:01,389
Alright!

631
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:06,031
What are you reading?

632
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:08,567
"Hunger..."

633
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:13,035
It's Norwegian.

634
00:52:14,398 --> 00:52:16,776
I'm going in now.
Are you gonna take much longer?

635
00:52:17,768 --> 00:52:20,408
No, come in if you want.

636
00:52:38,422 --> 00:52:41,266
Son of a bitch!

637
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:46,130
I'm gonna kick your ass!

638
00:53:50,861 --> 00:53:52,636
Come on, man!

639
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:38,076
We were in tenth or eleventh grade
and we were really stoned.

640
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:40,651
It was one of the first times
we all smoked together.

641
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:42,352
We were in...

642
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,823
Fatso's grandma's house...

643
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:50,163
in the yard. At one point
I went to his grandma's room.

644
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,400
She had died recently...

645
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:56,966
And I saw Leo there...

646
00:54:58,261 --> 00:55:01,265
and Fer, making out in the room.

647
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:04,709
We were just kids
and we were stoned.

648
00:55:04,835 --> 00:55:06,980
Besides, we had to experiment
a little, right?

649
00:55:07,003 --> 00:55:11,952
No, but I don't think
we were making out, man.

650
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:15,217
No, I totally remember.
We were making out.

651
00:55:15,846 --> 00:55:17,951
It was my bisexual phase.

652
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:20,726
Now I'm totally gay.

653
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:24,292
No, wait a minute.
I really don't remember that.

654
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:28,426
I think we must've been
so stoned that we imagined it,

655
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:30,562
but that's all, man.

656
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:34,534
Well, everyone should be able
to do whatever they want.

657
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:36,209
It's like Juan says,
the more gay guys there are,

658
00:55:36,233 --> 00:55:38,270
the more girls there are for us.

659
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:41,783
The other day,
Fatso and I were at Serrano

660
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:43,940
and he was totally freaking out.

661
00:55:44,241 --> 00:55:47,120
"This place is full of gay people!
Cocksuckers!"

662
00:55:47,244 --> 00:55:51,386
and Juan said "Take it easy, Fatso.

663
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:53,186
The more gay guys there are,

664
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,696
the more chicks there are for us
to choose from."

665
00:55:55,785 --> 00:55:57,321
That's how it is.

666
00:55:57,621 --> 00:55:59,726
Last time we were...

667
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:03,838
I don't get people who think
that if you go to a gay bar

668
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:06,271
all the guys are going
to hit on you.

669
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:07,841
It's not true.

670
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:10,901
Gays play hard-to-get
more than girls.

671
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:12,740
I swear it's true.

672
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:15,908
The other day Flor and I
went to a party

673
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:18,780
full of gay Peronists...
You know she's an activist there?

674
00:56:20,177 --> 00:56:24,023
And I looked like the gayest guy in
there, with the shirt I was wearing.

675
00:56:24,181 --> 00:56:25,901
I'm serious.
No one gave me the time of day.

676
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:28,255
They don't even look at you.
That's how it is.

677
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:45,811
Wait...

678
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:49,416
Okay, but where are you guys now?

679
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:54,318
Yeah, obviously, man.

680
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:58,254
Yeah. But stay there
at the gas station.

681
00:56:58,315 --> 00:56:59,851
I'll be there in half an hour.

682
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,224
Okay?

683
00:57:01,685 --> 00:57:04,063
Yeah... Alright, man.
Alright!

684
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:06,793
Maxi...

685
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:10,994
Maxi, come with me
to pick Fatso up.

686
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:13,664
He's with Juan.
The girls left him there.

687
00:57:13,897 --> 00:57:15,399
They went to another party.

688
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:18,677
Maxi...

689
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:21,943
What? Did they have sex?

690
00:57:22,072 --> 00:57:24,575
Fatso said he did.
He screwed her in a bathroom.

691
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,815
But Juan didn't. He just
made out with her in the yard.

692
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:30,157
Come on, man. Let's go.

693
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:33,527
- I'm exhausted, man.
- Come on! Don't be inconsiderate!

694
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:36,394
Stop bothering me, man.

695
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:41,099
- Come on, man! Come on!
- Alright!

696
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:50,065
Let's go.

697
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:14,365
Listen, now you guys
go out and play soccer

698
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:18,204
and let Andrea clean up, please.

699
01:02:18,635 --> 01:02:21,980
Okay, but Fede's lying down
because he doesn't feel well.

700
01:02:24,007 --> 01:02:26,112
But he won't get in the way.

701
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:28,451
In any case, she can just
not clean that room.

702
01:02:28,545 --> 01:02:30,525
Of course, that's no problem.

703
01:02:30,947 --> 01:02:33,154
Who? The boy with the blue eyes?

704
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:35,196
German, a friend of mine
from Taekwondo.

705
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:37,696
He came to our house several
times. You've seen him, right?

706
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:42,291
Yeah, but I didn't know
he was everyone else's friend too.

707
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:45,302
No, he's my friend.
But I told him to come along.

708
01:02:45,395 --> 01:02:47,932
Because he was going to go to
the South with a couple of friends

709
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:49,839
and they started dating.

710
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:51,942
They told him
they wanted to go alone,

711
01:02:52,035 --> 01:02:54,481
so he had nowhere to go
on vacation.

712
01:02:54,871 --> 01:02:57,977
Text me when you finish, okay?

713
01:02:58,041 --> 01:03:01,079
I left you your pay
for last week and today.

714
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:02,210
Okay.

715
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:17,096
- Are you alright, Andrea?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

716
01:04:54,791 --> 01:04:56,771
- You got my number, right?
- Yeah.

717
01:04:57,093 --> 01:04:58,093
Okay.

718
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:02,302
You can send me a missed call
if you want, so...

719
01:05:02,432 --> 01:05:03,775
I'll call you later.

720
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:06,810
I have two kids, you know?

721
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:10,810
I'm separated,
but I've got two kids.

722
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:13,351
I can be a good dad
if you give me a chance.

723
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:16,986
What are their names?

724
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:18,387
Lucas and Manuel.

725
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:21,519
- Six and four.
- Nice names.

726
01:05:49,212 --> 01:05:50,589
Out!

727
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:05,798
Out!

728
01:06:07,196 --> 01:06:08,800
Damn it!

729
01:06:18,841 --> 01:06:19,841
Fuck!

730
01:06:48,871 --> 01:06:51,681
- Juan...
- What?

731
01:06:51,774 --> 01:06:53,253
Roll another one.

732
01:06:53,643 --> 01:06:55,782
But there's only enough
for one more.

733
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:05,090
Ger...

734
01:07:05,922 --> 01:07:07,924
Didn't you have a friend
who's staying near here

735
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:09,661
who had weed?

736
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:11,595
Yeah.

737
01:07:11,994 --> 01:07:13,473
He's near here...

738
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:16,370
Twenty minutes away.

739
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:19,177
Tell him to bring some
and we'll buy some from him.

740
01:07:20,102 --> 01:07:23,242
No, he'll bring me some.
It's no problem.

741
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:24,977
He has a bunch of plants.

742
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:26,609
He's really cool.

743
01:07:26,676 --> 01:07:28,849
And he's totally out of his mind.

744
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:35,227
HEY, guys...

745
01:07:35,685 --> 01:07:37,562
Let's go buy meat early tomorrow,

746
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:41,007
because the other day we got there
late and there was none left.

747
01:07:41,824 --> 01:07:45,101
Hey, Fer! Do you want to go?

748
01:07:46,095 --> 01:07:48,041
- Yeah, alright.
- Okay.

749
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:50,743
Hey, Lucho fell asleep.

750
01:07:51,968 --> 01:07:57,145
Let's take some pictures of him
and post them for the group.

751
01:08:13,856 --> 01:08:15,460
What kind of group?

752
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:19,395
A Peronists group?

753
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:23,374
Yeah. We always take pictures
of Lucho.

754
01:08:33,542 --> 01:08:35,681
Hey... Fer...

755
01:08:36,512 --> 01:08:37,957
I'm serious.

756
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:41,528
I'm going to wake you up early
tomorrow.

757
01:08:44,387 --> 01:08:46,060
Don't stay up too late.

758
01:08:47,556 --> 01:08:49,365
Well, do whatever you want.

759
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:52,164
But I'm waking you up early
tomorrow.

760
01:08:52,528 --> 01:08:54,667
Okay, you can come jump on me
if I don't wake up.

761
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:56,002
Okay, bye-

762
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:57,499
Bye.

763
01:09:16,919 --> 01:09:18,796
They're always playing pranks
on Lucho, huh?

764
01:09:19,288 --> 01:09:20,288
Yeah.

765
01:09:21,557 --> 01:09:23,696
But he's the worst of them all.

766
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:27,739
One summer,
Juan got pictures of him

767
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:30,474
taking a dump in Fatso's bag.

768
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,509
He didn't care.

769
01:09:32,868 --> 01:09:37,874
Fede got his cell phone
and started taking pictures.

770
01:09:38,074 --> 01:09:44,923
And one year later,
Fede found the pics

771
01:09:45,414 --> 01:09:47,951
and he wanted to kill him.

772
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:51,365
They always pull pranks
like that, though.

773
01:09:51,454 --> 01:09:54,401
Sometimes they cross the line.

774
01:09:57,994 --> 01:10:00,474
Did you put some clothes
in the wash today too?

775
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:01,830
Yeah.

776
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:09,640
I don't have any
clean underwear left.

777
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:13,987
It doesn't matter.

778
01:10:14,276 --> 01:10:15,482
I'll just go to bed like this.

779
01:10:33,462 --> 01:10:35,806
I saw you reading "Demian."

780
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:40,106
You read a lot.

781
01:10:40,269 --> 01:10:42,215
I do quite a lot
of reading myself,

782
01:10:43,139 --> 01:10:44,777
but I think you beat me.

783
01:10:45,374 --> 01:10:47,411
No, only when I'm on vacation.

784
01:10:49,478 --> 01:10:51,617
During the year...

785
01:10:51,947 --> 01:10:55,121
I don't have time
to read anything.

786
01:10:55,484 --> 01:10:56,690
It's really hard.

787
01:10:56,819 --> 01:10:58,696
You know what I started doing?

788
01:10:58,854 --> 01:11:01,835
It's great. I go out
without a backpack

789
01:11:01,957 --> 01:11:03,630
and with a book.

790
01:11:03,959 --> 01:11:07,338
So since I don't have a backpack,
I carry them around in my hand.

791
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:10,406
When I'm on the subway,
the bus, or getting paperwork done,

792
01:11:10,499 --> 01:11:13,503
I read them and that's how
I finish them quickly.

793
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:14,977
So anyway...

794
01:11:16,705 --> 01:11:18,150
What about "Demian"?

795
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:20,015
Had you read it before?

796
01:11:20,076 --> 01:11:21,521
Yeah...

797
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:27,650
but I started looking into it
and I found out

798
01:11:27,817 --> 01:11:30,457
that it's Hesse's story.

799
01:11:30,753 --> 01:11:32,232
It's his story.

800
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:36,800
Actually, you know what he did?

801
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:41,130
He published the book with the name
of the main character: Sinclair.

802
01:11:41,263 --> 01:11:44,801
And then he said it was about him,

803
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:47,511
so they started
to publish it as "Hesse."

804
01:11:48,003 --> 01:11:51,382
I had already read Steppenwolf
and...

805
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:54,052
And...

806
01:11:56,612 --> 01:11:58,285
the one about Buddha...

807
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:01,015
Siddhartha.

808
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:03,085
Siddhartha, yeah.

809
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:09,469
Besides, I read it
when I was fourteen.

810
01:12:09,592 --> 01:12:11,230
A long time ago.

811
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,398
So I felt like reading it again.

812
01:12:37,153 --> 01:12:38,530
When I...

813
01:12:39,889 --> 01:12:41,425
When I read it,

814
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:46,304
I thought he was in love
with Demian.

815
01:12:52,468 --> 01:12:54,607
Yeah, it's a bit like that.

816
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:29,338
I'm totally in love with her.

817
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:31,075
I want to marry her.

818
01:13:31,207 --> 01:13:33,847
I don't really mind
her fits of jealousy.

819
01:13:33,976 --> 01:13:35,819
I can handle it.

820
01:13:35,945 --> 01:13:38,824
As long as I don't give her reasons
to be suspicious

821
01:13:38,948 --> 01:13:41,952
and start imagining things,

822
01:13:42,117 --> 01:13:44,961
I think she'll get over it.

823
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:48,325
- Yeah, I know you like her.
- Yeah, I love her!

824
01:13:48,891 --> 01:13:52,361
But she keeps asking me
if there are women here,

825
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:55,338
if any girls
are going to come over.

826
01:13:55,631 --> 01:13:58,168
She said she's going to
drop by unexpectedly.

827
01:13:58,334 --> 01:13:59,611
- You don't know when.
- I don't know.

828
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:00,812
She can come.
What's the problem?

829
01:14:00,836 --> 01:14:02,440
I don't know...

830
01:14:03,172 --> 01:14:04,378
But anyway...

831
01:14:04,873 --> 01:14:06,250
She's not dumb.

832
01:14:06,475 --> 01:14:08,186
She knows that there are going
to be women here sometimes,

833
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:09,518
friends of yours.

834
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:11,379
Yeah.

835
01:14:12,348 --> 01:14:15,522
But I think that if I don't give her
any reason to be suspicious,

836
01:14:16,552 --> 01:14:18,998
she'll start to relax.
I don't know.

837
01:14:20,856 --> 01:14:22,631
But I totally understand her.

838
01:14:23,092 --> 01:14:23,763
Why?

839
01:14:23,993 --> 01:14:26,269
Because her ex boyfriend
cheated on her with her friend.

840
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:28,170
No!

841
01:14:28,430 --> 01:14:30,103
- What a jerk!
- No wonder!

842
01:14:30,232 --> 01:14:31,734
- Now she's traumatized.
- Of course.

843
01:14:31,867 --> 01:14:33,912
She's paranoid that the person
she's with will cheat on her.

844
01:14:33,936 --> 01:14:36,644
That's why she asks me all the time
and calls me.

845
01:14:38,374 --> 01:14:41,514
- But the guy's an asshole.
- Yeah, he's an asshole.

846
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:42,987
And so is her friend.

847
01:14:43,112 --> 01:14:44,318
Her too.

848
01:14:45,681 --> 01:14:46,682
What a bitch!

849
01:14:46,749 --> 01:14:48,751
- I think you shouldn't play along.
- Yeah.

850
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:50,021
Right.

851
01:14:50,185 --> 01:14:53,394
I'd just want to have a girlfriend
so I don't get the blowfish anymore.

852
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:55,032
That's was a good one.

853
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:56,567
That's a good one.

854
01:14:56,692 --> 01:14:57,692
What?

855
01:15:03,032 --> 01:15:04,136
The blowfish!

856
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:07,077
You're terrible.
You love to cum inside, man.

857
01:15:09,138 --> 01:15:11,675
I'm serious, man. Stop it.

858
01:15:11,807 --> 01:15:14,151
One day someone's gonna
go to your house

859
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:16,552
late at night, ring the doorbell

860
01:15:16,645 --> 01:15:19,353
and say "Juan, this is your kid.

861
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:22,690
Kid, this is your dad.
You have to take care of him."

862
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:24,831
You'll want to kill yourself!

863
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,960
Knock on wood, man.
What are you talking about?

864
01:15:26,989 --> 01:15:29,196
I will, but you have to
take care of yourself.

865
01:15:31,593 --> 01:15:32,799
He's right.

866
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:34,901
Yeah, man. Wear a condom.

867
01:15:52,748 --> 01:15:53,886
I'm going to wake Fer up.

868
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:55,825
Alright, alright.
Do you want some coffee?

869
01:15:57,152 --> 01:15:58,825
Yeah, okay. I'll be right down.

870
01:16:13,802 --> 01:16:15,110
Fer...

871
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:17,006
Hey.

872
01:16:20,676 --> 01:16:21,950
Fer...

873
01:16:23,846 --> 01:16:25,519
Hey! Wake up.

874
01:16:27,983 --> 01:16:30,259
Let's go buy some meat.
Come on!

875
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:34,293
Hey! Fer!

876
01:16:34,490 --> 01:16:36,970
Come on, dude! Wake up!

877
01:16:37,559 --> 01:16:39,869
Come on, you cocksucker!
Wake up! Come on!

878
01:16:39,995 --> 01:16:42,305
Come on! I'm going to jump on you!
Come on!

879
01:16:42,398 --> 01:16:43,536
Come on, cocksucker!

880
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:46,135
Come on! Hey! Fer!

881
01:16:46,502 --> 01:16:47,674
Hey!

882
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:49,076
Okay, alright.

883
01:16:49,238 --> 01:16:50,842
I'll be waiting for you downstairs.

884
01:16:51,407 --> 01:16:52,909
Come on, cocksucker!

885
01:18:20,996 --> 01:18:22,634
Ger, are you in there?

886
01:18:23,165 --> 01:18:24,371
Yeah.

887
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:28,377
- Diego woke you up, right?
- Yes.

888
01:18:29,304 --> 01:18:32,478
Okay, I'm going
to go shopping with him

889
01:18:32,574 --> 01:18:34,247
and I'll see you later, okay?

890
01:18:34,409 --> 01:18:35,581
Okay.

891
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:19,687
Hi.

892
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:22,456
Hi.

893
01:19:22,524 --> 01:19:24,367
How are you?

894
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:30,908
How was your trip?

895
01:19:51,253 --> 01:19:53,859
Hi. What are you doing here,
honey?

896
01:20:01,396 --> 01:20:04,240
You look beautiful.
Did you come here by yourself?

897
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:06,777
No, I came with Carla.

898
01:20:07,069 --> 01:20:08,571
With Carla?

899
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:10,909
You're not mad, are you?

900
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:16,179
I don't know, honey.
I'm really sleepy. Just let me sleep.

901
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:18,224
You're so beautiful.

902
01:20:26,121 --> 01:20:28,101
Are you happy I came?

903
01:20:28,457 --> 01:20:31,563
I'm really sleepy, honey.
Stop asking me that.

904
01:20:42,371 --> 01:20:43,714
Pass it to me!

905
01:20:50,112 --> 01:20:51,955
Under the bridge...

906
01:20:52,114 --> 01:20:53,114
It's great.

907
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:57,526
I can tell you what I think...

908
01:21:43,098 --> 01:21:44,372
Hey, Fer...

909
01:21:45,534 --> 01:21:47,207
What's up with German?

910
01:21:47,936 --> 01:21:49,745
What do you mean "what's up"?

911
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:52,682
I don't know. You tell me.

912
01:22:03,118 --> 01:22:07,260
I think you guys look like
you make a good karate duo.

913
01:22:29,144 --> 01:22:32,148
We always look like the ones
who are desperate to have kids,

914
01:22:32,247 --> 01:22:35,785
but that's because you guys can have
kids your whole lives and we can't.

915
01:22:35,984 --> 01:22:38,863
For example, my cousin and my sister
are always making calculations.

916
01:22:39,221 --> 01:22:41,531
You take one year to meet someone,

917
01:22:41,656 --> 01:22:44,432
two years to get along well

918
01:22:44,659 --> 01:22:46,366
and three years
to move in together.

919
01:22:46,495 --> 01:22:49,271
But if things don't work,
you're back where you started,

920
01:22:49,364 --> 01:22:51,674
and then you've wasted
three years of your life.

921
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,138
I don't know.

922
01:22:53,335 --> 01:22:56,145
The reality is that you guys
can have kids

923
01:22:56,271 --> 01:22:58,979
with the first woman you meet
at whatever age.

924
01:22:59,407 --> 01:23:02,616
You can have a kid at 50
if you're with a young woman.

925
01:23:02,778 --> 01:23:04,951
Tomas' face talking about kids.

926
01:23:07,115 --> 01:23:09,994
No, I ask her about it
more than she says.

927
01:23:10,118 --> 01:23:13,258
I say we should have them now
when we're young.

928
01:23:13,522 --> 01:23:16,366
But she wants to go to school
and all that, right?

929
01:23:16,525 --> 01:23:17,663
It's true.

930
01:23:18,093 --> 01:23:20,073
If it were up to me,
I'd have kids right now.

931
01:23:24,099 --> 01:23:25,407
Now!

932
01:23:56,331 --> 01:24:00,507
Last year, my boyfriend and I
went backpacking to the south,

933
01:24:00,735 --> 01:24:02,442
to Rincon Rincon Azul.
Do you know it?

934
01:24:02,571 --> 01:24:05,017
- Yeah.
- It's great!

935
01:24:05,273 --> 01:24:09,415
Because there are refuges
in that area where you can stay

936
01:24:09,578 --> 01:24:11,751
for as many days as you want.

937
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:15,650
The water there is turquoise.
That place is amazing.

938
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:18,424
You know where you really
have to go?

939
01:24:18,653 --> 01:24:21,293
To the North,
the whole Northern area...

940
01:24:21,489 --> 01:24:24,026
Purmamarca, Humahuaca...

941
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:26,298
I have a bunch of contacts
at the hostels there.

942
01:24:26,428 --> 01:24:28,305
If you want,
I'll give you my Humahuaca number

943
01:24:28,496 --> 01:24:30,416
- and send you all the information.
- Okay, yeah.

944
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,675
What I really want to see,
even though it's more expensive,

945
01:24:35,804 --> 01:24:37,977
is Chile.
I'm dying to go there.

946
01:24:38,106 --> 01:24:40,382
I want to go to Pucén,
Villarica...

947
01:24:40,609 --> 01:24:42,316
and then go down to Valdivia.

948
01:24:42,677 --> 01:24:45,715
I went there when I was a kid,
with my parents.

949
01:24:45,947 --> 01:24:47,722
But I don't remember anything.

950
01:24:47,849 --> 01:24:49,988
I remember a fish market

951
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:52,158
and the sea lions
that were there, lying in the sun.

952
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:54,494
People would feed them.

953
01:24:57,292 --> 01:25:00,171
Do you want me to give you
my whatsapp number now

954
01:25:00,295 --> 01:25:01,638
so we don't forget?

955
01:25:01,730 --> 01:25:03,607
- Okay.
- Yeah?

956
01:25:30,392 --> 01:25:31,769
Hi!

957
01:25:33,895 --> 01:25:35,431
What are you guys doing?

958
01:25:37,165 --> 01:25:39,304
No, come over here.
We're having a blast!

959
01:25:40,502 --> 01:25:43,506
Okay, go get Luli
and all of you come over.

960
01:25:43,605 --> 01:25:45,050
The house is great.

961
01:25:45,173 --> 01:25:48,120
Fer said we can all stay
in his mom's room.

962
01:25:50,445 --> 01:25:54,393
Yeah... We're with Fede,
Diego, Maxi...

963
01:25:56,351 --> 01:25:57,351
Yeah.

964
01:25:58,219 --> 01:26:01,257
They're the guys you met
at Centenario Park. Remember?

965
01:26:04,192 --> 01:26:07,196
They're not annoying at all.
I'm here with Carla...

966
01:26:07,963 --> 01:26:09,601
and we're having the best time.

967
01:26:09,698 --> 01:26:11,200
The best time.

968
01:26:12,133 --> 01:26:14,613
Come on. It's a lot more fun.

969
01:26:16,905 --> 01:26:19,749
Really, the house is huge
and they'll leave us

970
01:26:19,874 --> 01:26:21,820
two or three bedrooms.

971
01:26:23,611 --> 01:26:24,954
Stop it!

972
01:26:27,115 --> 01:26:28,253
Okay.

973
01:26:30,652 --> 01:26:31,790
Alright.

974
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:33,959
Shut up!

975
01:26:34,089 --> 01:26:36,069
Alright, bye.

976
01:26:37,459 --> 01:26:38,733
Well? Well?

977
01:26:38,793 --> 01:26:40,500
They're not coming.

978
01:26:41,096 --> 01:26:43,633
I know them.
They're not gonna come.

979
01:26:44,499 --> 01:26:47,105
Why did you have to whisper
all the time, Fatso?

980
01:26:47,235 --> 01:26:49,112
I just said we have
a tennis court and a pool!

981
01:26:49,170 --> 01:26:50,649
They heard you, Fatso!

982
01:26:56,845 --> 01:26:58,119
Tomas...

983
01:26:58,279 --> 01:27:00,384
I'm taking the toothbrush, okay?

984
01:27:02,617 --> 01:27:04,221
Sleep well.

985
01:28:07,916 --> 01:28:09,293
Do you want to go to sleep?

986
01:28:10,151 --> 01:28:11,494
Okay, yeah.

987
01:28:27,001 --> 01:28:28,708
Are you still in a relationship?

988
01:28:32,707 --> 01:28:33,708
Yeah.

989
01:28:35,343 --> 01:28:37,380
- You too, right?
- Yeah.

990
01:28:39,013 --> 01:28:40,933
We're actually thinking
about moving in together.

991
01:28:41,049 --> 01:28:42,357
<i>Really?</i>

992
01:28:43,451 --> 01:28:44,987
So are we.

993
01:28:47,455 --> 01:28:49,731
But we're just starting
to talk about it.

994
01:28:52,393 --> 01:28:53,838
But it's a big step.

995
01:28:54,596 --> 01:28:55,596
Yeah.

996
01:28:58,433 --> 01:29:00,606
It's kind of like getting married.

997
01:29:01,569 --> 01:29:03,879
- I don't know...
- But it's cool.

998
01:29:05,206 --> 01:29:07,413
I don't know if it's cool
to think about it like that.

999
01:29:08,543 --> 01:29:09,988
But yeah, I don't know.

1000
01:29:20,288 --> 01:29:21,926
So are you faithful?

1001
01:29:27,629 --> 01:29:29,973
As much as possible.

1002
01:29:54,956 --> 01:29:56,401
I'm gonna wake him up.

1003
01:29:56,491 --> 01:29:58,437
No, no, no! Don't do that.

1004
01:29:58,526 --> 01:30:01,530
- Come on!
- No! He won't wake up.

1005
01:30:01,663 --> 01:30:04,473
- Yeah!
- Okay, do whatever you want.

1006
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:09,274
They always take your bed.

1007
01:30:15,443 --> 01:30:16,786
What do we do?

1008
01:30:18,179 --> 01:30:20,887
We can sleep in your bed.

1009
01:30:21,216 --> 01:30:23,059
Okay.

1010
01:30:42,136 --> 01:30:44,616
You sleep on the side of the wall,
okay?

1011
01:31:07,662 --> 01:31:09,664
Should I turn off the lights?

1012
01:31:09,831 --> 01:31:11,139
Yeah.

1013
01:31:39,127 --> 01:31:40,435
Fer...

1014
01:31:42,096 --> 01:31:45,600
- Hey, man...
- What's the matter?

1015
01:31:45,867 --> 01:31:48,177
Come with me to get some pastries.

1016
01:31:48,303 --> 01:31:51,477
Lucho took my car to take
Guada's friend to the capital.

1017
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:53,519
Just go on foot.

1018
01:31:53,641 --> 01:31:55,643
Come on, man! Take me in your car.

1019
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:57,753
Just go on foot.
It's really nearby.

1020
01:31:57,812 --> 01:32:00,258
I'm not going to go on foot.
Come on, get up!

1021
01:32:00,782 --> 01:32:03,456
I always go.
You guys are so lazy!

1022
01:32:06,454 --> 01:32:08,297
I'll go with you.

1023
01:32:44,592 --> 01:32:45,593
What happened?

1024
01:32:45,693 --> 01:32:47,673
The chick's amazing!

1025
01:32:47,862 --> 01:32:51,742
We were making out
next to the tennis court.

1026
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:57,272
At one point, she looks at the shed
and says "What's in there?"

1027
01:32:57,605 --> 01:32:58,879
And that was it.

1028
01:32:59,006 --> 01:33:01,885
She pulled down my pants
and started sucking my cock...

1029
01:33:02,043 --> 01:33:03,852
It was awesome!

1030
01:33:04,779 --> 01:33:07,817
Then I went to the bedroom
to get the condoms

1031
01:33:07,949 --> 01:33:09,986
and this idiot
didn't want to give me any.

1032
01:33:10,718 --> 01:33:11,856
Nah...

1033
01:33:12,954 --> 01:33:15,298
But I thought the girl
was really faithful,

1034
01:33:15,456 --> 01:33:17,800
or at least
that's what Guada says.

1035
01:33:18,059 --> 01:33:21,529
Maybe since both of them are
in a relationship, she didn't care.

1036
01:33:21,963 --> 01:33:24,136
But if Lucho hadn't told me
that he saw it,

1037
01:33:24,298 --> 01:33:25,971
I wouldn't have believed it.

1038
01:33:26,134 --> 01:33:28,478
Why were you spying on us,
you cocksucker?

1039
01:33:28,669 --> 01:33:30,876
If I had seen you, I would've
beaten the crap outta you.

1040
01:33:31,072 --> 01:33:32,244
I'm serious.

1041
01:33:32,373 --> 01:33:34,011
That's not right.

1042
01:33:34,175 --> 01:33:36,815
You screwed the girl I'd been
flirting with all afternoon,

1043
01:33:36,911 --> 01:33:38,618
with my condoms...

1044
01:33:39,147 --> 01:33:41,991
The least I could do
was watch her in action a little.

1045
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:48,223
You always say Leo's a cocksucker,

1046
01:33:48,489 --> 01:33:51,095
but you were watching her
suck on my cock.

1047
01:33:51,526 --> 01:33:53,733
Yeah... Yeah right, you cocksucker.

1048
01:33:53,928 --> 01:33:55,930
You perverted voyeur.

1049
01:33:57,698 --> 01:33:59,177
What's the matter with you?

1050
01:34:08,042 --> 01:34:09,646
I'm pissing myself.

1051
01:34:17,185 --> 01:34:18,562
Are you coming with me?

1052
01:35:05,433 --> 01:35:07,470
Hey, Fer's a good fighter,
right?

1053
01:35:08,970 --> 01:35:10,278
We don't fight.

1054
01:35:11,672 --> 01:35:13,151
We just train.

1055
01:35:15,610 --> 01:35:20,582
But Fer's the best.
Everyone loves him.

1056
01:35:21,682 --> 01:35:23,491
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

1057
01:35:25,186 --> 01:35:29,032
When we were kids
and we went out dancing,

1058
01:35:29,524 --> 01:35:32,004
a couple of times
we got into fights with people.

1059
01:35:32,126 --> 01:35:35,130
But he was always there for us.

1060
01:35:35,596 --> 01:35:37,735
He'd always defend us...

1061
01:35:38,766 --> 01:35:41,212
Anyone. He was always the first one
to defend anyone.

1062
01:35:42,670 --> 01:35:44,115
It's too bad...

1063
01:35:45,306 --> 01:35:48,014
he's head over heels in love
with a friend of my girlfriend's.

1064
01:35:48,943 --> 01:35:53,221
It's been ages,
but he's still in love with her.

1065
01:35:54,382 --> 01:35:57,090
The four of us used to double date.

1066
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:59,960
We went on vacation together once.

1067
01:36:01,455 --> 01:36:05,267
But since the girl left him,
he hasn't been with anyone else.

1068
01:36:06,661 --> 01:36:07,833
It's crazy.

1069
01:36:09,063 --> 01:36:11,043
- Didn't he tell you?
- No.

1070
01:36:11,399 --> 01:36:12,901
No, I didn't know.

1071
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,980
Yeah, he's head-over-heels in love.

1072
01:36:15,202 --> 01:36:17,648
He doesn't even talk
about the girl though, you know?

1073
01:36:17,905 --> 01:36:21,011
He didn't tell you, but I know.

1074
01:36:21,142 --> 01:36:23,247
I've known Fer for a long time

1075
01:36:23,744 --> 01:36:25,917
and I know he's in love.

1076
01:36:26,147 --> 01:36:28,093
Even though he doesn't mention her.

1077
01:36:28,349 --> 01:36:29,828
He's crazy about her.

1078
01:36:29,984 --> 01:36:33,693
If the girl wanted to get back
together with him,

1079
01:36:33,821 --> 01:36:35,926
he wouldn't think twice.

1080
01:36:36,324 --> 01:36:37,860
I'm sure he wouldn't.

1081
01:37:21,535 --> 01:37:24,015
Hey, your friend,
the one with the weed, is here.

1082
01:37:24,105 --> 01:37:25,709
- Seba?
- Yeah.

1083
01:37:26,107 --> 01:37:28,587
He looks like a real bum.

1084
01:37:32,279 --> 01:37:33,986
- Did he tell you anything?
- No.

1085
01:37:37,151 --> 01:37:38,357
Thanks, Seba.

1086
01:37:38,486 --> 01:37:39,624
Awesome.

1087
01:37:41,055 --> 01:37:42,898
I came in, he opened the door...

1088
01:37:42,990 --> 01:37:44,067
And when I saw all those
straight guys in the pool,

1089
01:37:44,091 --> 01:37:45,536
I almost died.

1090
01:37:45,660 --> 01:37:48,607
One of them, the big blond guy,
was in his underwear.

1091
01:37:48,729 --> 01:37:52,006
He took it off
and put on his bathing suit.

1092
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:53,801
I went crazy.

1093
01:37:53,934 --> 01:37:55,914
They said "Get in the pool."

1094
01:37:55,970 --> 01:37:59,645
I thought if I got in the pool,
I'd turn into a mermaid

1095
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:01,478
and I'd be exposed.

1096
01:38:03,310 --> 01:38:06,120
I'm dying to have sex
with all of them.

1097
01:38:07,748 --> 01:38:10,126
So what's up with that guy?
Fernando, right?

1098
01:38:10,251 --> 01:38:11,251
Yeah.

1099
01:38:12,086 --> 01:38:13,963
I don't know what's up with him.

1100
01:38:14,321 --> 01:38:16,130
I'm kind of confused.

1101
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:19,036
I don't get it.
We're together all the time

1102
01:38:19,427 --> 01:38:21,373
and he keeps looking at me.

1103
01:38:21,996 --> 01:38:23,805
He laughs a lot.

1104
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:30,309
Last night we slept together
and in the middle of the night,

1105
01:38:30,371 --> 01:38:34,319
I felt his hard cock
against my leg.

1106
01:38:35,776 --> 01:38:38,985
But I don't know,
because we were sleeping.

1107
01:38:39,113 --> 01:38:42,219
You're slow. I would've gone down
to drink from the hose.

1108
01:38:43,651 --> 01:38:47,030
No, no, no. I don't know.

1109
01:38:49,156 --> 01:38:52,763
I was just talking to Leo,
the guy we came with,

1110
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:55,067
and he confused me even more.

1111
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:01,077
That Leo guy stares a lot.

1112
01:39:01,302 --> 01:39:02,906
I think he's gay.

1113
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:04,745
I don't know.
That's the impression I got.

1114
01:39:04,805 --> 01:39:06,910
I think he's gay too.

1115
01:39:33,334 --> 01:39:35,280
You suck, Fatso!

1116
01:39:40,441 --> 01:39:43,115
There's the fucking ball,
you idiot!

1117
01:39:43,511 --> 01:39:45,957
- Take it easy!
- He said I suck!

1118
01:39:46,013 --> 01:39:48,391
Relax, Diego!

1119
01:39:51,118 --> 01:39:52,995
Who do you think you are?
Messi?

1120
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:54,599
Milky butt.

1121
01:40:00,694 --> 01:40:02,298
Here you go, Meathead.

1122
01:40:04,732 --> 01:40:06,871
There you go, you idiot!

1123
01:40:07,134 --> 01:40:09,478
He's been cheating all day!

1124
01:40:09,637 --> 01:40:12,641
And you guys don't say anything.
You play dumb too.

1125
01:40:12,773 --> 01:40:13,911
Shut up, man!

1126
01:40:13,974 --> 01:40:15,817
Don't tell me to shut up!

1127
01:40:16,210 --> 01:40:17,553
Forget it.

1128
01:40:25,486 --> 01:40:26,829
Hi!

1129
01:40:27,822 --> 01:40:29,665
- How are you, Piojo?
- What's up?

1130
01:40:29,990 --> 01:40:30,991
Everything's fine.

1131
01:40:37,565 --> 01:40:38,669
<i>How are you guy's doing?</i>

1132
01:40:40,501 --> 01:40:44,813
The cops took our bags
like they were going to check them.

1133
01:40:45,072 --> 01:40:51,250
I wasn't worried, because
I didn't have anything at the time.

1134
01:40:51,946 --> 01:40:55,257
But at one point, someone
started talking louder

1135
01:40:55,449 --> 01:40:58,089
in another language.
That made us more nervous

1136
01:40:58,252 --> 01:41:00,459
because we couldn't understand
what they were saying.

1137
01:41:01,956 --> 01:41:07,406
I turn around and I see
a huge blonde woman

1138
01:41:07,695 --> 01:41:10,141
with my jean jacket in her hand...

1139
01:41:10,297 --> 01:41:12,800
She was holding it
as if it were dirty.

1140
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:17,148
And in the other hand,
she was wearing a blue glove

1141
01:41:17,204 --> 01:41:19,684
and holding some shrooms,
like evidence.

1142
01:41:19,874 --> 01:41:23,549
When I saw that I realized
that I had something...

1143
01:41:23,844 --> 01:41:26,825
But when I saw the jacket,

1144
01:41:26,947 --> 01:41:30,622
I realized that I had had
that jacket for five years

1145
01:41:30,718 --> 01:41:32,095
and I hadn't washed it,

1146
01:41:32,219 --> 01:41:33,830
so those shrooms had been in there
for a long time.

1147
01:41:33,854 --> 01:41:36,357
They were all old and dry,

1148
01:41:36,490 --> 01:41:38,094
so they weren't effective anymore.

1149
01:41:38,192 --> 01:41:40,001
They analyzed them

1150
01:41:40,194 --> 01:41:42,697
and realized there was no problem.

1151
01:41:42,830 --> 01:41:45,868
They had us there for a while...

1152
01:41:45,966 --> 01:41:49,914
In the end we even laughed
about it together

1153
01:41:50,170 --> 01:41:53,117
and that was it.
They let us go.

1154
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:56,449
So luckily I'm here
and I can tell about it.

1155
01:41:56,911 --> 01:41:58,254
I'm free.

1156
01:41:58,579 --> 01:42:02,117
So I brought you a couple of...

1157
01:42:02,349 --> 01:42:05,330
a couple of interesting things
for you to have fun tonight.

1158
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:07,756
So enjoy it.

1159
01:42:07,922 --> 01:42:10,198
We can get in the pool later,
if you want.

1160
01:43:47,921 --> 01:43:49,764
Do you want to go to the pool?

1161
01:43:50,491 --> 01:43:51,799
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1162
01:44:35,202 --> 01:44:37,204
- Is my eye red?
- Let me see.

1163
01:44:48,482 --> 01:44:49,654
Lucho...

1164
01:44:51,652 --> 01:44:53,256
- Did you guys get some rest?
- Yeah.

1165
01:44:53,487 --> 01:44:54,864
The guys already left.

1166
01:44:54,922 --> 01:44:56,868
They didn't want to wake you up.

1167
01:44:57,858 --> 01:45:00,532
Leo got up early
and started getting on our nerves.

1168
01:45:00,861 --> 01:45:02,863
He took everyone, Maxi, Fede...

1169
01:45:03,163 --> 01:45:06,042
We're going to go back
in a van later.

1170
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:08,840
You have to leave the car
to your Mom, right?

1171
01:45:08,902 --> 01:45:11,405
Yeah, because she needs it.

1172
01:45:12,439 --> 01:45:14,112
We'll help you clean up later.

1173
01:45:15,442 --> 01:45:18,082
Are you staying till tomorrow?

1174
01:45:18,212 --> 01:45:19,088
Yeah.

1175
01:45:19,213 --> 01:45:21,159
I'll clean up with him.

1176
01:45:24,418 --> 01:45:25,954
We'll be back in a while.

1177
01:45:26,553 --> 01:45:27,553
See ya.

1178
01:45:42,803 --> 01:45:46,444
- Do you wanna go?
- Let's go.

1179
01:46:37,758 --> 01:46:39,066
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1180
01:46:39,159 --> 01:46:40,695
One, two, three.

1181
01:47:39,853 --> 01:47:41,833
Did you have a good time?

1182
01:47:42,823 --> 01:47:45,099
Yeah... I had a great time.

1183
01:50:11,304 --> 01:50:13,511
Can I kiss you?



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
