1
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,208
That's Juancho.

2
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:16,574
The house is huge.

3
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,876
Yeah, it wasn't this big
when I was a kid.

4
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,350
The last things they built
were the rooms upstairs

5
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:24,950
and in the back,
the sauna, Jacuzzi

6
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:26,781
the massage room.

7
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,850
- Wow! That's great!
- It's amazing. Very relaxing.

8
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:34,295
At one point my dad set up a spa

9
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,400
and a rehabilitation center
for smokers.

10
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,489
That's great.

11
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:41,835
Yeah, a group of people would
come here and stay for a week

12
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,169
and they'd stop smoking.

13
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:48,576
- A tennis court and pool.
- That's great!

14
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,670
Two of them came
on Saturday night...

15
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:54,649
Maxi, the blond, and Tomi.
They're sleeping there.

16
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:57,913
And there's Diego.

17
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:00,387
Fede! Is everything alright?

18
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,756
- What's up?
- I'm Germén. Nice to meet you.

19
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,726
How are you? Did you sleep well?

20
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:10,028
Yeah, but I went to sleep late.
We stayed up late.

21
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,960
I was really stoned.

22
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:16,369
Lucho and Maxi were wasted.
We were laughing our heads off.

23
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:19,872
We ended up in the pool.

24
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:23,778
And Juan, who was wasted too,

25
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,446
threw Diego into the pool.

26
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:29,879
- No! He must've been pissed.
- Yeah, with his clothes on.

27
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,752
I think he even had
his cell phone on him.

28
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,722
No way!

29
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:38,955
Yeah, I think he did,
because of how pissed off he was.

30
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:41,731
Yeah, he was furious.
I went away.

31
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,035
I didn't want any trouble.

32
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,434
That's a typical day here.

33
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,435
Yeah, that's true.

34
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,204
Do you want mate or coffee?

35
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,374
I'm going to show him the room
and then we'll come downstairs.

36
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,207
Alright.

37
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,382
Hey, man, put on
some swim trunks or something.

38
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:02,952
This guy goes around naked all day.

39
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,419
Nice to meet you.

40
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,357
Hi, what's up?

41
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:16,932
- Hi, Germén.
- How are you? Diego.

42
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:18,323
Is everything alright?

43
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,271
I went to take a dump upstairs because
the other bathroom's full of puke.

44
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,202
There too?

45
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:26,139
Lucho threw up before going to sleep
and it's still there...

46
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,479
pieces of carrot and everything.

47
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:31,777
And I told you to come here
to relax for a few days,

48
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,919
but that doesn't seem to be the plan
for this weekend.

49
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,212
Did you come by train?

50
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,219
Yeah, the trip was amazing.
I loved it.

51
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,781
- Yeah, I came on that train too.
- I never came on that train.

52
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,119
- They say it's great.
- Yeah.

53
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:45,127
- Did you guys have breakfast?
- No, but Fede's making some mate.

54
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,322
I'm going to show him his room

55
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,091
and then we'll come down
for breakfast.

56
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,996
Okay? 'Okay, great?

57
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,262
Thanks.

58
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,741
- What are you eating, Fatso?
- An egg. I was hungry.

59
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:13,874
What's up?

60
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:20,655
I just had an awesome lucid dream.

61
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,280
Yeah?

62
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:26,828
- What does "lucid" mean?
- That it's real. It's very real.

63
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,465
What did you dream?

64
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,598
I was in Tigre, at my sister's house,

65
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,438
next to the river.

66
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,667
I don't know what I was doing,
or who I was with, but I was there.

67
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:43,301
And?

68
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:47,883
Everything was the same,
the house, the grill in the backyard.

69
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:51,548
I don't know why I went inside
and went up the stairs.

70
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,585
I went up three floors.

71
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:58,024
But I think
it's a one-story house.

72
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,228
- What?
- I think it's a one-story house.

73
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,361
And when I got to the terrace,

74
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,096
the water was at the level
of the balcony.

75
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,267
There was a lot of water.

76
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,106
It was as if there were a waterfall
a hundred yards away.

77
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,235
Yeah.

78
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,240
But I had gone up two floors

79
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,876
so there couldn't be water
on both levels,

80
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,416
So then I realized it was a dream.

81
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,929
And whenever I realize that,
I feel like having sex...

82
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:37,792
so I started walking,
knowing I could wake up any minute.

83
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,834
I passed a bridge.

84
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:44,007
I went inside this place with bars,
like a nightclub.

85
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:47,203
And I started making out
with the first chick I saw.

86
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:48,366
I took off her clothes,

87
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:51,413
I started sucking her tits
and her pussy really hard.

88
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:56,212
And the chick just stood there.

89
00:07:56,576 --> 00:08:00,251
You know like in dreams when
the characters suddenly stop moving?

90
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,359
- Yeah, that's weird.
- Yeah.

91
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:07,092
And at one point,
her pussy started getting sandy...

92
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,733
and... bam! I got up.

93
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,666
I opened my eyes and looked at
the ceiling. I thought "Damn it!"

94
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,399
But it was cool while it lasted.

95
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:16,939
The part about the sand
freaked me out.

96
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:17,964
Yeah.

97
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:25,283
But it was so real
that I can still taste her pussy.

98
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:29,175
- Sweet!
- It was really pink and delicious!

99
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:33,621
- We have to call some girls over.
- We need it, huh?

100
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:34,746
Yeah.

101
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,286
Alright.

102
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,235
- Mario Bros isn't a cartoon, man.
- Yeah it is.

103
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,742
No, man, that's what
you didn't get yesterday.

104
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,913
Mario Bros isn't a cartoon.

105
00:08:56,035 --> 00:09:00,711
You guys said it was
and I said it wasn't.

106
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,750
That's why I think I didn't lose.

107
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,444
Did you used to watch
Mario Bros cartoons?

108
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,651
It's the same thing.
It's like a cartoon.

109
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:11,762
You just can't admit that you lost
because you couldn't guess

110
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:15,355
and now you're saying that if we
had told you it wasn't a cartoon,

111
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:16,797
you would've guessed,

112
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,392
and then you would've said
that it's a kind of cartoon.

113
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,765
Come on, Diego. I know you!

114
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,372
See how competitive you are?

115
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:26,135
I couldn't care less!
You're the one who's competitive!

116
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,303
I hate it when people mix up
the actors, the people,

117
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:31,846
with characters.

118
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,382
One time Fatso got Jack Sparrow

119
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,518
and when he asked if it was an actor,
you said yes.

120
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,317
No! The actor's Johnny Depp.

121
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,288
Jack Sparrow worked as a pirate.

122
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,858
- "Worked as a pirate"?
- Yeah!

123
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,983
Now being a pirate's a job.

124
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,355
I hate it when you don't understand
the example. It pisses me off.

125
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,555
You're so competitive.

126
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,420
Come on, Diego!

127
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,309
Hey, Fatso, have you seen Fer?

128
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:46,784
Fatso!

129
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:05,967
The chick flirts with me
when we're all working...

130
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,773
and then she plays hard-to-get.

131
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:14,611
- I mean...
- Like how?

132
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,414
We were going to Pablo's house.
You know the guy with long hair?

133
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,510
Yeah.

134
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,921
Okay, Pablo, Agus, the chick and me.

135
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,859
Pablo and Agus went
to buy some beer

136
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:26,262
and the girl and I were alone.

137
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:31,324
I sat next to her because
she wanted to show me a message

138
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,528
and the girl gave me
the cold shoulder.

139
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,140
She was cold as ice.
She went to the bathroom.

140
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,366
She always act like that,
hysterical.

141
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:43,674
The next day at work,
in front of everyone,

142
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:47,910
she walked in, kissed me here
and gave me a neck massage.

143
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,975
She always does the same thing.

144
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:52,122
She's crazy.

145
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,780
Forget about her.

146
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,046
Yeah.

147
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,560
- Have you guys seen Fer?
- No.

148
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:06,534
So?

149
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:11,031
Are you sure the girl doesn't
know you're in a relationship?

150
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:14,178
No, man, I'm sure.

151
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,904
Girls find out about those things.

152
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:20,780
There's no way she could know.
And I don't think the guys told her,

153
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,982
because they know
I want to screw her...

154
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,385
Right.

155
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,190
- It's okay.
- Yeah.

156
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,398
But you have a girlfriend.

157
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,193
To each his own.

158
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,564
- I found this one.
- Yeah.

159
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,092
But it's almost empty.

160
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,101
The mosquitoes are killing me.

161
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:19,635
Here you go...

162
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,269
As soon as I came in
they started to bite me too.

163
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,409
They bit you all over!

164
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:27,984
Look here...

165
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,110
No way, man!

166
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,183
They bit me all over!

167
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,619
Here...

168
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,213
Here...

169
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:38,249
And here too.

170
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,796
As I was saying...

171
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,996
Diego and Juan the longest.

172
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,937
I've them since we were
in kindergarten.

173
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,238
But we're all very good friends.

174
00:13:57,102 --> 00:14:00,413
We met the rest later on.

175
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:05,750
In primary school, we met Lucho,
Leo and Tomi.

176
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:14,245
And Maxi used to go out
with Tomi's sister.

177
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,464
He used to play soccer with us
all the time,

178
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,469
so we started getting along
really well with him.

179
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,802
And we met Fatso in eleventh grade.

180
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:27,638
I think he had failed five
or six times. We lost track.

181
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,744
Yeah, you can tell he's older.

182
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,748
And you're not going to meet
Santiago today,

183
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:38,151
because he moved to Spain
when he met a Spanish girl here.

184
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,358
He used to come back
every two or three months,

185
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:46,162
but then he started coming here
less frequently.

186
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:51,798
I don't think he'd come back now,

187
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,605
if he didn't come back
two years ago.

188
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:56,966
Leo...

189
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,333
Hi.

190
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,797
Well, I'm going to the pool.

191
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:01,163
You do karate with Fer, right?

192
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,772
It's not karate, you idiot.

193
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,773
- It's the same thing.
- It's not the same thing.

194
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:08,301
Yeah, I used to do karate,
but when I moved to Adrogué,

195
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:11,881
I started doing taekwondo,
because that's all they had there.

196
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:16,716
I did it to do some kind of sport.

197
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:21,683
I don't like it that much.
I don't have a belt or anything.

198
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,091
I don't know if I'm going to
get different color belts.

199
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,188
You work at the pool bar
at San Martin Square, right?

200
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:29,388
Yeah.

201
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,032
We saw you there one day
with Fer, right?

202
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:32,763
Yeah, actually,
that's where we met.

203
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:34,427
We started talking a lot

204
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,872
and he told me
to try out the club,

205
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:39,838
so we became friends.

206
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,270
Are you studying anything?

207
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,144
I used to study architecture
and I dropped out.

208
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,545
- Where?
- In La Plata.

209
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:47,446
- Nice!
- Yeah, I liked it...

210
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:49,449
I like to draw,

211
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:53,387
but I'd rather draw things
like comic book illustrations...

212
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,254
Real drawings.

213
00:16:55,981 --> 00:17:00,088
So anyway...
I'd love to draw for a living.

214
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:03,629
But it's very hard
to find the right connections.

215
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,362
- Fer has a big comic book collection.
- Yeah.

216
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:07,635
Have you guys seen it?
It's huge!

217
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:08,831
Yeah.

218
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,642
- Should I roll a blunt?
- Please.

219
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,745
Yeah, okay.

220
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:40,553
Hey, what's up?
Is everything alright?

221
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:41,960
Yeah.

222
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,397
THE CATCHER IN THE RYE

223
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:31,570
Are you enjoying it?

224
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,409
It's awesome.

225
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,682
He's a great writer.

226
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:38,420
Yeah, he is.

227
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,367
What are you doing, man?

228
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:06,042
Lucho, you were a total chicken!

229
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:09,244
I'd be scared of Fatso too.

230
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:15,552
Yeah, man, stop overdoing it.
It's not a World Cup.

231
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,159
You kick too hard.

232
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:22,095
I said I'm not gonna beat you up
because you're weak,

233
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,335
but if you keep bothering me,
I'll beat the crap outta you.

234
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,692
So are your friends coming here
on Saturday or not?

235
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,434
You always act like you're faithful,

236
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:34,371
but you're dying
to meet those girls. What the hell?

237
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:35,671
You're So 93V!

238
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,543
Shut up!

239
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,843
Don't be gay!

240
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,117
I just want some eye candy,
that's all.

241
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,018
But are they coming?

242
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:50,091
When they saw there were
eight of us, they left early.

243
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,856
Well, Maca said
she wasn't coming,

244
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:58,128
but if we throw a party,
she'll come with more friends.

245
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,336
The other day,
it was eight of us against four.

246
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,472
There can't be two of us for each.

247
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:05,838
It's not like
we're going to make porn.

248
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,809
- But Juan screwed one of them.
- Yeah.

249
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,073
They're no prudes.

250
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:14,043
I didn't screw the other one
because she knows I have a girlfriend,

251
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:15,881
otherwise, I would've done it.

252
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,577
Totally.

253
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:07,926
- Did you buy chocolate milk?
- Yeah.

254
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,853
Hey, Germén,
are you in a relationship?

255
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,289
He's Fer's boyfriend.

256
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:31,792
Are you jealous,
you cocksucking pussy?

257
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,853
No, I'm single.

258
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:36,031
If I looked like Brad Pitt

259
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:38,931
and girls hit on me
like they probably hit on this guy,

260
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,730
I wouldn't stop fooling around
until I'm in my forties

261
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,340
and then I'd start thinking
about a relationship.

262
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:47,273
You always want a girlfriend
to cheat on her with sluts.

263
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:51,440
The only faithful guy here
is Tomés.

264
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,913
I'm pretty faithful too, man.

265
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,915
Yeah, right.

266
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:58,344
It's not like girls are
faithful either.

267
00:22:58,477 --> 00:22:59,785
I don't believe that at all.

268
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:03,826
Of course not.
They're just like us, or worse.

269
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:05,689
They're just really sly.

270
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:08,457
They get away with it
and you never find out.

271
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,217
I don't know what's up with the guy.

272
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:36,086
What I do know is that
he doesn't have a girlfriend.

273
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:40,492
I'm not making it up, man.

274
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,094
Why did he invite me?

275
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,168
I don't know.

276
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,311
Your head would explode
if you were here.

277
00:23:57,335 --> 00:24:00,316
They walk around naked all the time.

278
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:07,316
Hey, today they asked me
if I was in a relationship...

279
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,721
and I said no.

280
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,954
No, man. I didn't lie.

281
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,827
They didn't ask me
if I had a girlfriend.

282
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,764
No, I didn't lie.

283
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:23,062
And Fer was just listening.

284
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:28,244
Are you stupid?

285
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:30,209
Fer's the guy.

286
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:34,642
If some chicks come here
and he screws one of them,

287
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,150
I'll just die.

288
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,117
Yeah.

289
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,470
I don't know.
I'm just going to stay here.

290
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:57,429
I'm going to play dumb for a while
and see what he does.

291
00:24:58,296 --> 00:24:59,400
I don't know.

292
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:05,779
You're so stupid.

293
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,749
<i>Okay, bye. We-</i>

294
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,240
Bye.

295
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,094
Hi.

296
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,737
- How are you?
- Fine.

297
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:04,602
Great.

298
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:07,643
Sorry to bother you,
but I'm about to make a barbecue

299
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,337
and we don't have any newspapers.

300
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:11,812
- Do you have any?
- Yeah, I'm sure we have some.

301
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:13,281
- I'll bring you some.
- Thanks.

302
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:14,338
- Hi.
- Hi.

303
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:14,907
Hi.

304
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,040
Hi.

305
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,245
- Hi.
- Hi.

306
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,748
- How are you?
- Fine.

307
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:26,454
- There are so many of you.
- Yeah.

308
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:36,262
- Nice weather, huh?
- Yeah.

309
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,038
How are the girls?

310
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:46,012
Fine.

311
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:48,617
You should make them wear
sunscreen. The sun's really burning.

312
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:51,813
Yeah, I know.
But they're inside right now,

313
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,784
otherwise they can't
get to sleep at night.

314
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,756
There he is.

315
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,562
- Is this enough?
- Yeah, this is great.

316
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,135
- Yeah?
- Thanks.

317
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:09,227
If you need more,
just let us know.

318
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,738
- Okay, thanks.
- Bye.

319
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:12,864
'BYE, guys! 'BYE-bye.

320
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:20,745
She was cute!

321
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,246
Really cute!

322
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,385
You voted for the wrong guy,
admit it.

323
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,085
I don't know.
I have no idea about politics.

324
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:32,019
I shouldn't have even told you.

325
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:34,893
If you have no idea,
you should go and ask.

326
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,759
I'm not saying you have
to understand,

327
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:41,897
but you're old enough
to not vote for just anyone.

328
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:45,436
You're not choosing
where you're going to go on vacation.

329
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:46,563
Right?

330
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:50,503
There's a whole bunch
of stuff at play.

331
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:56,150
You should've asked me about it,
or your dad.

332
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,321
Well, not your dad...

333
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:02,023
But you should've asked around
a little,

334
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,185
so at least you know
what you're voting for.

335
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:09,457
Or would you screw a girl
without a condom

336
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:13,033
just because she says
she's on the pill?

337
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:15,195
It depends how hot she is.

338
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,637
- But that's a bad example.
- Why?

339
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:23,075
Because you supposedly
trust the girl.

340
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,908
You don't think
she's gonna lie to you.

341
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:27,340
But if you vote for the wrong person,

342
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:28,951
you end up taking it up the butt.

343
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:30,584
They say they're gonna give you
a back massage

344
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,119
and they end up sticking it
up your butt.

345
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:33,654
If they stick it up your butt,
at least it should be

346
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:35,680
because you want to feel it inside.

347
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,966
Hey, you really look Argentinian.

348
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,267
What do you mean?

349
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:52,371
- What do you look like?
- Spanish.

350
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:54,074
And me?

351
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:57,779
French. All you need
is a beret and a paintbrush.

352
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,145
What about me?

353
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,183
Italian.

354
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:05,652
Fatso looks Russian.

355
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,020
Tomés looks Arabian.

356
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:11,284
Leo looks German
and Diego looks Swedish.

357
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,036
What do I look like?

358
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,482
You look English.

359
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:37,883
You look like
an English soccer player.

360
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:49,562
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

361
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:52,395
eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,

362
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:54,935
seventeen, eighteen, nineteen,
twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two,

363
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,462
twenty-three, twenty-four,
twenty-five,

364
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:59,115
twenty-six, twenty-seven,
twenty-eight,

365
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,767
twenty-nine, thirty!

366
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,627
What's the matter with you?
You're always cheating!

367
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:06,108
- What happened?
- Did you hear that?

368
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,742
You're always cheating, man!

369
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,446
You can't play like that!

370
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:13,144
Stop!

371
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,877
Stop it, Leo!

372
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:16,945
You moron!

373
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:18,948
Who are you calling a moron?

374
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:23,486
He's an idiot! He keeps cheating!
I can't play like this!

375
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:25,595
- Stop it, Leo.
- Relax...

376
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,162
Stop it!

377
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:29,492
Stop, Leo!

378
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:32,127
It's not a championship.
You get too worked up.

379
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,260
They why are we playing?

380
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:36,972
Take it easy! And you too!

381
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,353
I'm gonna score.

382
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,306
Pass the blunt, man.
You're smoking it all by yourself.

383
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:16,505
Don't get upset, man.

384
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:18,879
We were just playing
and you got really pissed off!

385
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:22,783
But if we're playing and you cheat,
it sucks. You can't do that!

386
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:25,854
- Stop being such a pussy!
- What are you talking about, asshole?

387
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:27,920
We were just fooling around
for a while!

388
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,617
- You're a jerk, man.
- Go fuck yourself!

389
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:37,996
Let me have some.

390
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,168
Mother fucker...

391
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:25,714
Milo Manara.

392
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,986
Milo Manara?

393
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,652
Don't you know him?

394
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:35,615
He's an Italian...

395
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:41,955
A genius. My dad had
a bunch of his comic books.

396
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:47,066
I know the classic ones more,
the American ones.

397
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,193
- Like this one.
- Yeah.

398
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:57,444
My dad had all of Manara's
comic books and Fierro's.

399
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:59,114
That's cool.

400
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:03,879
I used to take them from my dad
when I was a kid, because...

401
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:08,617
there were naked people in them.
They would really turn me on.

402
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:13,052
At first I thought Milo Manara
was the name of the main character,

403
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:18,290
but when I was older I realized
it was the name of the artist.

404
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:22,301
Actually, "Click"
is his most well-known comic...

405
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,100
Well the one I know the best.

406
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:30,610
It was about a guy who had put
a device in a girl...

407
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:33,976
and he'd click a remote control
that would make her have orgasms.

408
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,942
He'd click it
and she'd have an orgasm.

409
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:40,284
And he'd spy on her. It was amazing.

410
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,921
It blew your mind.

411
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:45,255
Actually, I should ask my dad for it
and read it again,

412
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:47,761
It's crazy... crazy.

413
00:34:54,325 --> 00:35:02,039
When I was in school,
I used to draw a lot of superheroes.

414
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:08,376
One day, some friends of mine
made a magazine.

415
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,980
It was a school magazine...

416
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:16,747
It was a magazine for the school,
like an alternative magazine.

417
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:17,881
Yeah.

418
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:24,066
And one day they asked me to do
a two-page comic.

419
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,059
I had to do everything...

420
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:30,161
The drawings, the dialogs...

421
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:32,138
The whole comic, you know?

422
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,006
- And did they publish it?
- Yeah.

423
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,937
- That's cool!
- Yeah, really cool.

424
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:38,637
To see your work published.

425
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:43,044
Yeah. And what I would do was...

426
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:46,711
I used to use
other people's material a little...

427
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:51,424
Actually, I mostly adapted
story lines from short stories,

428
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:52,959
like Cortézafls.

429
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:54,559
Cool!

430
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:58,030
It was cool, because
they were superheroes,

431
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,763
but with a more surrealist style...

432
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:04,304
Like the characters' background.

433
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:06,908
Yeah, it was like a dream.
It was cool.

434
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:08,775
Amazing.

435
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:18,981
Do you want to go to sleep?

436
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:21,022
Yeah... Okay.

437
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:27,261
Hey, Leo...

438
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:30,363
Leo...

439
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,398
Come on, Leo. Go to your bed.

440
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:39,205
Come on, Leo.

441
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,137
This guy always does the same thing.

442
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:47,883
Okay, I'll go sleep downstairs.

443
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,188
- See you tomorrow.
- Alright.

444
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:38,856
Guada?

445
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,893
- Yeah.
- What's the matter?

446
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:44,832
She wants me to go with her
to the party,

447
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:48,199
But that's not it. I know her.

448
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:49,530
She's jealous.

449
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,605
She asked me if there were
any girls here.

450
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:56,643
She doesn't believe me when
I say that no girls came over,

451
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,671
none of your friends.

452
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:04,545
We spent two great weeks
in Ostende,

453
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:08,481
but now she doesn't understand
that I want to be with you guys.

454
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:11,149
It's not that I don't want
to be with her.

455
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,157
She's great. You know her.
She's really sweet,

456
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:19,060
but she can be really insecure

457
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:23,599
and it gets on my nerves.

458
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,272
I know I have my flaws,

459
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,715
but I don't get jealous.

460
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,919
You shouldn't pay attention to her.

461
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:50,055
It's her problem, man.

462
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:53,865
Let her figure it out,
even if it hurts.

463
00:39:56,961 --> 00:40:00,499
What are you going to do?
Go back to Buenos Aires?

464
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:04,271
You're going to get upset
and you won't be able to relax.

465
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,882
Because you're fine here with us.

466
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:13,977
So you're going to be pissed off
and you guys are going to fight.

467
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:16,546
Tomi...

468
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,250
Forget it.

469
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:22,464
Don't forget that you met her
when you were with Lucia.

470
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:27,024
So it's natural
that she'd be scared and insecure.

471
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:30,070
Yeah, I know that, but...

472
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:33,301
I really love her.

473
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:36,811
I'd die if I couldn't be with her.

474
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,790
Hey, man...

475
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:02,300
Germén's pretty weird.

476
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:07,401
I just went into Fer's room
and he was going through his bag.

477
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:14,772
I can't believe you, man.
You're always making things up.

478
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:20,189
Fernando and that guy have been
training together all year.

479
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:23,618
Fer told me he really trusts him.

480
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:29,364
You're just a cocksucker,
that's the problem.

481
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,331
So you make things up.
I know you.

482
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:39,003
Look at Diego
going through my bag.

483
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:40,871
Is this your bag?

484
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,939
Hey, what T-shirts did you bring?

485
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:49,441
Can I borrow one?

486
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,349
But give it back to me later.

487
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:57,516
The other day you were wearing
a sweatshirt of mine

488
00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:59,368
that I had been looking for
for a long time.

489
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:01,020
Yeah, laugh all you want.
It's true.

490
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,131
I just love your clothes.

491
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,735
Okay, stop looking through
my stuff. I'll show you.

492
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:10,931
- Alright, alright!
- Don't go through everything.

493
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:13,108
- Alright...
- I don't like it.

494
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,738
There you go.

495
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:15,865
Thanks.

496
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:32,517
It's really hard for me
not to get upset.

497
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,430
No one's faster than him, man!

498
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,255
The guy's effective.

499
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:41,967
He doesn't have to make
any fancy moves.

500
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:45,902
They guy's straightforward.
He's simple.

501
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,134
That's why he's the best.

502
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:50,836
Yeah, but you used to say
that Maradona was the best

503
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:53,448
and now because you read
a couple of interviews...

504
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,211
Yeah, I did read a couple
of interviews,

505
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,842
but I've also watched him

506
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:03,254
and he doesn't put on a show
for the cameras like the rest.

507
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:07,659
He's simple and quick

508
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,731
and it's also a generational thing.

509
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,025
Times have changed.

510
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:17,736
And I don't agree with the idiots
who say he scores goals abroad

511
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:19,636
- and here he sucks.
- Yeah, well.

512
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,903
People who say that are idiots.

513
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:23,437
Don't you think?

514
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,777
- The guys are here with pastries.
- Awesome!

515
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:29,685
- How are you guys?
- Cool!

516
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,553
What's up, guys?

517
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:36,957
You wouldn't believe the accident
there was around the corner.

518
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:38,014
- It's awful.
- Really?

519
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:39,082
Yeah, yeah.

520
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:41,195
- What happened?
- A crash.

521
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,957
Hey, Fer,
where are we going tomorrow?

522
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,569
I don't know.
Wherever you guys want?

523
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:51,503
We could go to that nightclub
with the pool in the middle

524
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,836
that the guy fell into
with all his clothes on.

525
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:56,507
Otherwise,
we can go to the capital

526
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,477
and come back at night.

527
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:00,582
Are you crazy? You want us
to go to the capital?

528
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:01,876
Let's go somewhere nearer,

529
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,781
otherwise Fer and Leo
won't be able to drive,

530
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:05,512
they won't be able
to drink anything.

531
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:09,022
Do you want us to come back
wasted like the other day,

532
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:11,026
when we almost
got ourselves killed?

533
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:13,784
Hey, I'm not dangerous.

534
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:15,795
I don't drink anymore.

535
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,362
Yeah, right.

536
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:30,576
Hey, man,
this meat's like butter.

537
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:32,477
Don't you think?

538
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:34,080
The other day, Diego and I
bought meat at the supermarket

539
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:35,811
and it wasn't like this at all.

540
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:37,279
This is totally different.

541
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:38,546
Yeah.

542
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:42,116
And you ate three sausages,
you cocksucker. You must be full.

543
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:44,815
That butt sure imports
a lot of meat.

544
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:48,055
He gave it to me, you idiot.

545
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,462
You're the weirdest
vegetarian I know.

546
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:54,462
You never eat meat;
You're always really fussy,

547
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:56,036
but you eat barbecue.

548
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:58,572
But I never say I don't eat meat.

549
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,472
I don't go around telling people
that I'm vegetarian.

550
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:03,839
But it's true.
I hardly ever eat meat.

551
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:05,742
Only when there's barbecue.

552
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:09,307
<i>The other day, Redo and X
went to a restaurant</i>

553
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:10,918
and we ordered meat.

554
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:14,319
But you bother me so much about it.

555
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:18,288
I can eat meat
wheneverl feel like it.

556
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:23,164
So does you girlfriend
eat your meat?

557
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,528
Of course she does.

558
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:26,123
She eats it whole.

559
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:29,397
What about you? You should
probably get a girlfriend too.

560
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,800
How long has it been
since this guy had sex?

561
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:34,600
Like four months.

562
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:38,809
You can't get a girl
to save your life.

563
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:41,208
You don't have to be so mean.

564
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:02,334
Today's December 6,
my mom's birthday.

565
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,038
I have to call her.

566
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:13,271
Lucho's always teasing Leo,
you know?

567
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:16,503
Do you think Leo's really gay?

568
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,204
I don't know.

569
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:20,941
Maybe.

570
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:25,450
The guy's weird.
He's always been weird.

571
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:30,616
The two girlfriends he had were
the only chicks he's ever screwed.

572
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:36,521
Plus, sometimes he just stares
at you. It's weird.

573
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:40,534
And you don't know
if he's looking at you, at him...

574
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:43,160
or if he likes you.
I don't know. That's what I think.

575
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:44,965
Yeah, yeah. I agree.

576
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:50,135
I don't know. It's also weird
that his two girlfriends

577
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:52,873
are the only girls
he's ever screwed.

578
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:55,507
Now he's with this chick, Rocio...

579
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:58,911
but Rocio used to go out
with Mono

580
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:02,888
and Mono says
she never wanted to have sex.

581
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,254
So I don't know.

582
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:08,927
- I have an aunt who's a lesbian.
- Yeah.

583
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,567
She says that
if you're really bisexual,

584
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:15,633
you have no trouble
repressing yourself,

585
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:18,170
because since you like
girls and guys,

586
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:20,502
if you meet a guy,
it doesn't matter,

587
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:23,545
you can be with him and then go
satisfy your needs with a chick.

588
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:26,511
It's no big deal.
It's easy to repress.

589
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:28,546
So you just leave him there
and that's it.

590
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:31,081
He's going to be the first
to get married,

591
00:48:31,174 --> 00:48:33,313
- whether he's gay or not.
- Yeah, maybe.

592
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:36,950
And we're going to be there
celebrating it with presents,

593
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:38,990
dancing at his wedding.

594
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:41,992
It's true.

595
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:07,785
You know I love Romi...

596
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:12,083
but I can't say no to girls
who call me for sex.

597
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:17,121
The other day, Romi had to
get some paperwork done.

598
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:18,733
She went to sleep at her house

599
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:23,031
because it was closer
to where she had to go the next day.

600
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:26,633
It's like she's a witch.

601
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:31,405
I don't know if this girl
is psychic or what...

602
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:34,845
Natalia texted me.
Remember Natalia, the skinny girl?

603
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:38,613
Remember? The skinny girl?

604
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:40,619
You wouldn't believe
what she looks like now.

605
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:43,782
She's got a lot more meat
on her bones and a great rack.

606
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:47,417
Man! I took a cab
and went to her house

607
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:51,063
and we fucked for nine hours.

608
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:53,765
Of course.
What was I supposed to do?

609
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:56,268
It's natural.

610
00:49:56,426 --> 00:49:59,600
Then I got home
and took a shower...

611
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,867
and I felt like shit.

612
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:04,238
I felt really guilty.

613
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:07,039
It sucks.

614
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:13,053
The important thing
is that Romi doesn't catch you,

615
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:16,283
because then
you'll want to kill yourself.

616
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:43,447
Hey, I think Germén is kind of gay.

617
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:48,281
You'd know if he was for sure.
It takes one to know one.

618
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:51,792
Stop it, man. Hey...

619
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:53,760
You keep calling me "cocksucker"
all day long.

620
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:55,388
"Cocksucker, cocksucker,
cocksucker."

621
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:57,590
You don't realize it,
but it gets annoying.

622
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,526
I'm sick of it.

623
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:02,167
Plus, I have a girlfriend.

624
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,633
You don't realize
I'm just kidding around.

625
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,840
Hey, stop! I was here first!

626
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:27,352
Diego, I'm gonna use your shampoo;
It's great!

627
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:28,622
Okay.

628
00:51:54,177 --> 00:51:56,157
Fer, I'm going to take a shower here,

629
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:59,250
because Lucho's using the shower
downstairs and he takes an hour.

630
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,589
Alright!

631
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:06,231
What are you reading?

632
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:08,767
"Hunger..."

633
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:13,235
It's Norwegian.

634
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:16,976
I'm going in now.
Are you gonna take much longer?

635
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,608
No, come in if you want.

636
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:41,466
Son of a bitch!

637
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:46,330
I'm gonna kick your ass!

638
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,836
Come on, man!

639
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:38,276
We were in tenth or eleventh grade
and we were really stoned.

640
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:40,851
It was one of the first times
we all smoked together.

641
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:42,552
We were in...

642
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,023
Fatso's grandma's house...

643
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:50,363
in the yard. At one point
I went to his grandma's room.

644
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,600
She had died recently...

645
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:57,166
And I saw Leo there...

646
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:01,465
and Fer, making out in the room.

647
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:04,909
We were just kids
and we were stoned.

648
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:07,180
Besides, we had to experiment
a little, right?

649
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:12,152
No, but I don't think
we were making out, man.

650
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:15,417
No, I totally remember.
We were making out.

651
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:18,151
It was my bisexual phase.

652
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:20,926
Now I'm totally gay.

653
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,492
No, wait a minute.
I really don't remember that.

654
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:28,626
I think we must've been
so stoned that we imagined it,

655
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:30,762
but that's all, man.

656
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:34,734
Well, everyone should be able
to do whatever they want.

657
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:36,409
It's like Juan says,
the more gay guys there are,

658
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:38,470
the more girls there are for us.

659
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:41,983
The other day,
Fatso and I were at Serrano

660
00:55:42,138 --> 00:55:44,140
and he was totally freaking out.

661
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:47,320
"This place is full of gay people!
Cocksuckers!"

662
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:51,586
and Juan said "Take it easy, Fatso."

663
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:53,386
The more gay guys there are,

664
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:55,896
"the more chicks there are for us
to choose from."

665
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:57,521
That's how it is.

666
00:55:57,821 --> 00:55:59,926
Last time we were...

667
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:04,038
I don't get people who think
that if you go to a gay bar

668
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:06,471
all the guys are going
to hit on you.

669
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:08,041
It's not true.

670
00:56:08,598 --> 00:56:11,101
Gays play hard-to-get
more than girls.

671
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:12,940
I swear it's true.

672
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:16,108
<i>The other day Her and X
went to a parky</i>

673
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:18,980
full of gay Peronists...
You know she's an activist there?

674
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:24,223
And I looked like the gayest guy in
there, with the shirt I was wearing.

675
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,101
I'm serious.
No one gave me the time of day.

676
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:28,455
They don't even look at you.
That's how it is.

677
00:56:44,634 --> 00:56:46,011
Wait...

678
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:49,616
Okay, but where are you guys now?

679
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:54,518
Yeah, obviously, man.

680
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:58,454
Yeah. But stay there
at the gas station.

681
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:00,051
I'll be there in half an hour.

682
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,424
Okay?

683
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:04,263
Yeah... Alright, man. Alright!

684
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:06,993
Maxi...

685
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:11,194
Maxi, come with me
to pick Fatso up.

686
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:13,864
He's with Juan.
The girls left him there.

687
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,599
They went to another party.

688
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,877
Maxi...

689
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,143
What? Did they have sex?

690
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,775
Fatso said he did.
He screwed her in a bathroom.

691
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:28,015
But Juan didn't. He just
made out with her in the yard.

692
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:30,357
Come on, man. Let's go.

693
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,727
- I'm exhausted, man.
- Come on! Don't be inconsiderate!

694
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:36,594
Stop bothering me, man.

695
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:41,299
- Come on, man! Come on!
- Alright!

696
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:50,265
Let's go.

697
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:14,565
Listen, now you guys
go out and play soccer

698
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:18,404
and let Andrea clean up, please.

699
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:22,180
Okay, but Fede's lying down
because he doesn't feel well.

700
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:26,312
But he won't get in the way.

701
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:28,651
In any case, she can just
not clean that room.

702
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,725
Of course, that's no problem.

703
01:02:31,147 --> 01:02:33,354
Who? The boy with the blue eyes?

704
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,396
Germén, a friend of mine
from Taekwondo.

705
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:37,896
He came to our house several
times. You've seen him, right?

706
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:42,491
Yeah, but I didn't know
he was everyone else's friend too.

707
01:02:42,658 --> 01:02:45,502
No, he's my friend.
But I told him to come along.

708
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:48,132
Because he was going to go to
the South with a couple of friends

709
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:50,039
and they started dating.

710
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:52,142
They told him
they wanted to go alone,

711
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:54,681
so he had nowhere to go
on vacation.

712
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:58,177
Text me when you finish, okay?

713
01:02:58,241 --> 01:03:01,279
I left you your pay
for last week and today.

714
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:02,410
Okay.

715
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:17,296
- Are you alright, Andrea?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

716
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:56,971
- You got my number, right?
- Yeah.

717
01:04:57,293 --> 01:04:58,293
Okay.

718
01:04:58,861 --> 01:05:02,502
You can send me a missed call
if you want, so...

719
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:03,975
I'll call you later.

720
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:07,010
I have two kids, you know?

721
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:11,010
I'm separated,
but I've got two kids.

722
01:05:11,173 --> 01:05:13,551
I can be a good dad
if you give me a chance.

723
01:05:15,878 --> 01:05:17,186
What are their names?

724
01:05:17,313 --> 01:05:18,587
Lucas and Manuel.

725
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:21,719
- Six and four.
- Nice names.

726
01:05:49,412 --> 01:05:50,789
Out!

727
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:05,998
Out!

728
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:09,000
Damn it!

729
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:20,041
Fuck!

730
01:06:49,071 --> 01:06:51,881
- Juan...
- What?

731
01:06:51,974 --> 01:06:53,453
Roll another one.

732
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,982
But there's only enough
for one more.

733
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:05,290
Ger...

734
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:08,124
Didn't you have a friend
who's staying near here

735
01:07:08,257 --> 01:07:09,861
who had weed?

736
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:11,795
Yeah.

737
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:13,673
He's near here...

738
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:16,570
Twenty minutes away.

739
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:19,377
Tell him to bring some
and we'll buy some from him.

740
01:07:20,302 --> 01:07:23,442
No, he'll bring me some.
It's no problem.

741
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:25,177
He has a bunch of plants.

742
01:07:25,307 --> 01:07:26,809
He's really cool.

743
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:29,049
And he's totally out of his mind.

744
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,427
HEY, guys...

745
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:37,762
Let's go buy meat early tomorrow,

746
01:07:38,687 --> 01:07:41,207
because the other day we got there
late and there was none left.

747
01:07:42,024 --> 01:07:45,301
Hey, Fer! Do you want to go?

748
01:07:46,295 --> 01:07:48,241
- Yeah, alright.
- Okay.

749
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:50,943
Hey, Lucho fell asleep.

750
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:57,345
Let's take some pictures of him
and post them for the group.

751
01:08:14,056 --> 01:08:15,660
What kind of group?

752
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:19,595
A whatsapp QFOUP?

753
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:23,574
Yeah. We always take pictures
of Lucho.

754
01:08:33,742 --> 01:08:35,881
Hey... Fer...

755
01:08:36,712 --> 01:08:38,157
I'm serious.

756
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:41,728
I'm going to wake you up early
tomorrow.

757
01:08:44,587 --> 01:08:46,260
Don't stay up too late.

758
01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:49,565
Well, do whatever you want.

759
01:08:50,259 --> 01:08:52,364
But I'm waking you up early
tomorrow.

760
01:08:52,728 --> 01:08:54,867
Okay, you can come jump on me
if I don't wake up.

761
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:56,202
<i>Okay. We-</i>

762
01:08:56,699 --> 01:08:57,699
Bye.

763
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:18,996
They're always playing pranks
on Lucho, huh?

764
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:20,488
Yeah.

765
01:09:21,757 --> 01:09:23,896
But he's the worst of them all.

766
01:09:24,059 --> 01:09:27,939
One summer,
Juan got pictures of him

767
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:30,674
taking a dump in Fatso's bag.

768
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:32,709
He didn't care.

769
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:38,074
Fede got his cell phone
and started taking pictures.

770
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:45,123
And one year later,
Fede found the pics

771
01:09:45,614 --> 01:09:48,151
and he wanted to kill him.

772
01:09:48,584 --> 01:09:51,565
They always pull pranks
like that, though.

773
01:09:51,654 --> 01:09:54,601
Sometimes they cross the line.

774
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:00,674
Did you put some clothes
in the wash today too?

775
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,030
Yeah.

776
01:10:07,303 --> 01:10:09,840
I don't have any
clean underwear left.

777
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:14,187
It doesn't matter.

778
01:10:14,476 --> 01:10:15,682
I'll just go to bed like this.

779
01:10:33,662 --> 01:10:36,006
I saw you reading "Demian."

780
01:10:39,134 --> 01:10:40,306
You read a lot.

781
01:10:40,469 --> 01:10:42,415
I do quite a lot
of reading myself,

782
01:10:43,339 --> 01:10:44,977
but I think you beat me.

783
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:47,611
No, only when I'm on vacation.

784
01:10:49,678 --> 01:10:51,817
During the year...

785
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:55,321
I don't have time
to read anything.

786
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:56,890
It's really hard.

787
01:10:57,019 --> 01:10:58,896
You know what I started doing?

788
01:10:59,054 --> 01:11:02,035
It's great. I go out
without a backpack

789
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:03,830
and with a book.

790
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:07,538
So since I don't have a backpack,
I carry them around in my hand.

791
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:10,606
When I'm on the subway,
the bus, or getting paperwork done,

792
01:11:10,699 --> 01:11:13,703
I read them and that's how
I finish them quickly.

793
01:11:13,869 --> 01:11:15,177
So anyway...

794
01:11:16,905 --> 01:11:18,350
What about "Demian"?

795
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,215
Had you read it before?

796
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:21,721
Yeah...

797
01:11:22,878 --> 01:11:27,850
but I started looking into it
and I found out

798
01:11:28,017 --> 01:11:30,657
that it's Hesse's story.

799
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:32,432
It's his story.

800
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:37,000
Actually, you know what he did?

801
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:41,330
He published the book with the name
of the main character: Sinclair.

802
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:45,001
And then he said it was about him,

803
01:11:45,367 --> 01:11:47,711
so they started
to publish it as "Hesse."

804
01:11:48,203 --> 01:11:51,582
I had already read Steppenwolf
and...

805
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:54,252
And...

806
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:58,485
the one about Buddha...

807
01:12:00,215 --> 01:12:01,215
Siddhartha.

808
01:12:01,283 --> 01:12:03,285
Siddhartha, yeah.

809
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:09,669
Besides, I read it
when I was fourteen.

810
01:12:09,792 --> 01:12:11,430
A long time ago.

811
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,598
So I felt like reading it again.

812
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:38,730
When I...

813
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:41,625
When I read it,

814
01:12:42,658 --> 01:12:46,504
I thought he was in love
with Demian.

815
01:12:52,668 --> 01:12:54,807
Yeah, it's a bit like that.

816
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:29,538
I'm totally in love with her.

817
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:31,275
I want to marry her.

818
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:34,047
I don't really mind
her fits of jealousy.

819
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:36,019
I can handle it.

820
01:13:36,145 --> 01:13:39,024
As long as I don't give her reasons
to be suspicious

821
01:13:39,148 --> 01:13:42,152
and start imagining things,

822
01:13:42,317 --> 01:13:45,161
I think she'll get over it.

823
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:48,525
- Yeah, I know you like her.
- Yeah, I love her!

824
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:52,561
But she keeps asking me
if there are women here,

825
01:13:52,694 --> 01:13:55,538
if any girls
are going to come over.

826
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:58,368
She said she's going to
drop by unexpectedly.

827
01:13:58,534 --> 01:13:59,811
- You don't know when.
- I don't know.

828
01:13:59,835 --> 01:14:01,012
She can come.
What's the problem?

829
01:14:01,036 --> 01:14:02,640
I don't know...

830
01:14:03,372 --> 01:14:04,578
But anyway...

831
01:14:05,073 --> 01:14:06,450
She's not dumb.

832
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:08,386
She knows that there are going
to be women here sometimes,

833
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:09,718
friends of yours.

834
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:11,579
Yeah.

835
01:14:12,548 --> 01:14:15,722
But I think that if I don't give her
any reason to be suspicious,

836
01:14:16,752 --> 01:14:19,198
she'll start to relax.
I don't know.

837
01:14:21,056 --> 01:14:22,831
But I totally understand her.

838
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:23,963
Why?

839
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:26,469
Because her ex boyfriend
cheated on her with her friend.

840
01:14:26,595 --> 01:14:28,370
No!

841
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:30,303
- What a jerk!
- No wonder!

842
01:14:30,432 --> 01:14:31,934
- Now she's traumatized.
- Of course.

843
01:14:32,067 --> 01:14:34,112
She's paranoid that the person
she's with will cheat on her.

844
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:36,844
That's why she asks me all the time
and calls me.

845
01:14:38,574 --> 01:14:41,714
- But the guy's an asshole.
- Yeah, he's an asshole.

846
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:43,187
And so is her friend.

847
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:44,518
Her too.

848
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:46,882
What a bitch!

849
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:48,951
- I think you shouldn't play along.
- Yeah.

850
01:14:49,117 --> 01:14:50,221
Right.

851
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:53,594
I'd just want to have a girlfriend
so I don't get the blowfish anymore.

852
01:14:53,889 --> 01:14:55,232
That's was a good one.

853
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:56,767
That's a good one.

854
01:14:56,892 --> 01:14:57,892
What?

855
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:04,336
The blowfish!

856
01:15:04,433 --> 01:15:07,277
You're terrible.
You love to cum inside, man.

857
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,875
I'm serious, man. Stop it.

858
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:14,351
One day someone's gonna
go to your house

859
01:15:14,476 --> 01:15:16,752
late at night, ring the doorbell

860
01:15:16,845 --> 01:15:19,553
and say "Juan, this is your kid."

861
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:22,890
Kid, this is your dad.
You have to take care of him."

862
01:15:23,085 --> 01:15:25,031
You'll want to kill yourself!

863
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:27,160
Knock on wood, man.
What are you talking about?

864
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:29,396
I will, but you have to
take care of yourself.

865
01:15:31,793 --> 01:15:32,999
He's right.

866
01:15:33,428 --> 01:15:35,101
Yeah, man. Wear a condom.

867
01:15:52,948 --> 01:15:54,086
I'm going to wake Fer up.

868
01:15:54,182 --> 01:15:56,025
Alright, alright.
Do you want some coffee?

869
01:15:57,352 --> 01:15:59,025
Yeah, okay. I'll be right down.

870
01:16:14,002 --> 01:16:15,310
Fer...

871
01:16:16,171 --> 01:16:17,206
Hey.

872
01:16:20,876 --> 01:16:22,150
Fer...

873
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:25,719
Hey! Wake up.

874
01:16:28,183 --> 01:16:30,459
Let's go buy some meat. Come on!

875
01:16:32,354 --> 01:16:34,493
Hey! Fer!

876
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:37,170
Come on, dude! Wake up!

877
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:40,069
Come on, you cocksucker!
Wake up! Come on!

878
01:16:40,195 --> 01:16:42,505
Come on! I'm going to jump on you!
Come on!

879
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:43,736
Come on, cocksucker!

880
01:16:43,832 --> 01:16:46,335
Come on! Hey! Fer!

881
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:47,874
Hey!

882
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:49,276
Okay, alright.

883
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:51,042
I'll be waiting for you downstairs.

884
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:53,109
Come on, cocksucker!

885
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:22,834
Ger, are you in there?

886
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:24,571
Yeah.

887
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:28,577
- Diego woke you up, right?
- Yes.

888
01:18:29,504 --> 01:18:32,678
Okay, I'm going
to go shopping with him

889
01:18:32,774 --> 01:18:34,447
and I'll see you later, okay?

890
01:18:34,609 --> 01:18:35,781
Okay.

891
01:19:18,887 --> 01:19:19,887
Hi.

892
01:19:21,656 --> 01:19:22,656
Hi.

893
01:19:22,724 --> 01:19:24,567
How are you?

894
01:19:29,731 --> 01:19:31,108
How was your trip?

895
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:54,059
Hi. What are you doing here,
honey?

896
01:20:01,596 --> 01:20:04,440
You look beautiful.
Did you come here by yourself?

897
01:20:04,599 --> 01:20:06,977
No, I came with Carla.

898
01:20:07,269 --> 01:20:08,771
With Carla?

899
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,109
You're not mad, are you?

900
01:20:11,373 --> 01:20:16,379
I don't know, honey.
I'm really sleepy. Just let me sleep.

901
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:18,424
You're so beautiful.

902
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:28,301
Are you happy I came?

903
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:31,763
I'm really sleepy, honey.
Stop asking me that.

904
01:20:42,571 --> 01:20:43,914
Pass it to me!

905
01:20:50,312 --> 01:20:52,155
Under the bridge...

906
01:20:52,314 --> 01:20:53,314
It's great.

907
01:20:53,448 --> 01:20:57,726
I can tell you what I think...

908
01:21:43,298 --> 01:21:44,572
Hey, Fer...

909
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:47,407
What's up with Germén?

910
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:49,945
What do you mean "what's up"?

911
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:52,882
I don't know. You tell me.

912
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:07,460
I think you guys look like
you make a good karate duo.

913
01:22:29,344 --> 01:22:32,348
We always look like the ones
who are desperate to have kids,

914
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:35,985
but that's because you guys can have
kids your whole lives and we can't.

915
01:22:36,184 --> 01:22:39,063
For example, my cousin and my sister
are always making calculations.

916
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:41,731
You take one year to meet someone,

917
01:22:41,856 --> 01:22:44,632
two years to get along well

918
01:22:44,859 --> 01:22:46,566
and three years
to move in together.

919
01:22:46,695 --> 01:22:49,471
But if things don't work,
you're back where you started,

920
01:22:49,564 --> 01:22:51,874
and then you've wasted
three years of your life.

921
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:53,338
I don't know.

922
01:22:53,535 --> 01:22:56,345
The reality is that you guys
can have kids

923
01:22:56,471 --> 01:22:59,179
with the first woman you meet
at whatever age.

924
01:22:59,607 --> 01:23:02,816
You can have a kid at 50
if you're with a young woman.

925
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:05,151
Tomés' face talking about kids.

926
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:10,194
No, I ask her about it
more than she says.

927
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:13,458
I say we should have them now
when we're young.

928
01:23:13,722 --> 01:23:16,566
But she wants to go to school
and all that, right?

929
01:23:16,725 --> 01:23:17,863
It's true.

930
01:23:18,293 --> 01:23:20,273
If it were up to me,
I'd have kids right now.

931
01:23:24,299 --> 01:23:25,607
Now!

932
01:23:56,531 --> 01:24:00,707
Last year, my boyfriend and I
went backpacking to the south,

933
01:24:00,935 --> 01:24:02,642
to Rincén del Azul.
Do you know it?

934
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:05,217
- Yeah.
- It's great!

935
01:24:05,473 --> 01:24:09,615
Because there are refuges
in that area where you can stay

936
01:24:09,778 --> 01:24:11,951
for as many days as you want.

937
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:15,850
The water there is turquoise.
That place is amazing.

938
01:24:16,451 --> 01:24:18,624
You know where you really
have to go?

939
01:24:18,853 --> 01:24:21,493
To the North,
the whole Northern area...

940
01:24:21,689 --> 01:24:24,226
Purmamarca, Humahuaca...

941
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:26,498
I have a bunch of contacts
at the hostels there.

942
01:24:26,628 --> 01:24:28,505
If you want,
I'll give you my whatsapp number

943
01:24:28,696 --> 01:24:30,616
- and send you all the information.
- Okay, yeah.

944
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:35,875
What I really want to see,
even though it's more expensive,

945
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:38,177
is Chile. I'm dying to go there.

946
01:24:38,306 --> 01:24:40,582
I want to go to Pucén,
Villarica...

947
01:24:40,809 --> 01:24:42,516
and then go down to Valdivia.

948
01:24:42,877 --> 01:24:45,915
I went there when I was a kid,
with my parents.

949
01:24:46,147 --> 01:24:47,922
But I don't remember anything.

950
01:24:48,049 --> 01:24:50,188
I remember a fish market

951
01:24:50,318 --> 01:24:52,358
and the sea lions
that were there, lying in the sun.

952
01:24:52,487 --> 01:24:54,694
People would feed them.

953
01:24:57,492 --> 01:25:00,371
Do you want me to give you
my whatsapp number now

954
01:25:00,495 --> 01:25:01,838
so we don't forget?

955
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:03,807
- Okay.
- Yeah?

956
01:25:30,592 --> 01:25:31,969
Hi!

957
01:25:34,095 --> 01:25:35,631
What are you guys doing?

958
01:25:37,365 --> 01:25:39,504
No, come over here.
We're having a blast!

959
01:25:40,702 --> 01:25:43,706
Okay, go get Luli
and all of you come over.

960
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:45,250
The house is great.

961
01:25:45,373 --> 01:25:48,320
Fer said we can all stay
in his mom's room.

962
01:25:50,645 --> 01:25:54,593
Yeah... We're with Fede,
Diego, Maxi...

963
01:25:56,551 --> 01:25:57,551
Yeah.

964
01:25:58,419 --> 01:26:01,457
They're the guys you met
at Centenario Park. Remember?

965
01:26:04,392 --> 01:26:07,396
They're not annoying at all.
I'm here with Carla...

966
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:09,801
and we're having the best time.

967
01:26:09,898 --> 01:26:11,400
The best time.

968
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:14,813
Come on. It's a lot more fun.

969
01:26:17,105 --> 01:26:19,949
Really, the house is huge
and they'll leave us

970
01:26:20,074 --> 01:26:22,020
two or three bedrooms.

971
01:26:23,811 --> 01:26:25,154
Stop it!

972
01:26:27,315 --> 01:26:28,453
Okay.

973
01:26:30,852 --> 01:26:31,990
Alright.

974
01:26:33,488 --> 01:26:34,159
Shut up!

975
01:26:34,289 --> 01:26:36,269
Alright, bye.

976
01:26:37,659 --> 01:26:38,933
Well? Well?

977
01:26:38,993 --> 01:26:40,700
They're not coming.

978
01:26:41,296 --> 01:26:43,833
I know them.
They're not gonna come.

979
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:47,305
Why did you have to whisper
all the time, Fatso?

980
01:26:47,435 --> 01:26:49,312
I just said we have
a tennis court and a pool!

981
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:50,849
They heard you, Fatso!

982
01:26:57,045 --> 01:26:58,319
Tomés...

983
01:26:58,479 --> 01:27:00,584
I'm taking the toothbrush, okay?

984
01:27:02,817 --> 01:27:04,421
Sleep well.

985
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:09,493
Do you want to go to sleep?

986
01:28:10,351 --> 01:28:11,694
Okay, yeah.

987
01:28:27,201 --> 01:28:28,908
Are you still in a relationship?

988
01:28:32,907 --> 01:28:33,908
Yeah.

989
01:28:35,543 --> 01:28:37,580
- You too, right?
- Yeah.

990
01:28:39,213 --> 01:28:41,133
We're actually thinking
about moving in together.

991
01:28:41,249 --> 01:28:42,557
Really?

992
01:28:43,651 --> 01:28:45,187
So are we.

993
01:28:47,655 --> 01:28:49,931
But we're just starting
to talk about it.

994
01:28:52,593 --> 01:28:54,038
But it's a big step.

995
01:28:54,796 --> 01:28:55,796
Yeah.

996
01:28:58,633 --> 01:29:00,806
It's kind of like getting married.

997
01:29:01,769 --> 01:29:04,079
- I don't know...
- But it's cool.

998
01:29:05,406 --> 01:29:07,613
I don't know if it's cool
to think about it like that.

999
01:29:08,743 --> 01:29:10,188
But yeah, I don't know.

1000
01:29:20,488 --> 01:29:22,126
So are you faithful?

1001
01:29:27,829 --> 01:29:30,173
As much as possible.

1002
01:29:55,156 --> 01:29:56,601
I'm gonna wake him up.

1003
01:29:56,691 --> 01:29:58,637
No, no, no! Don't do that.

1004
01:29:58,726 --> 01:30:01,730
- Come on!
- No! He won't wake up.

1005
01:30:01,863 --> 01:30:04,673
- Yeah!
- Okay, do whatever you want.

1006
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:09,474
They always take your bed.

1007
01:30:15,643 --> 01:30:16,986
What do we do?

1008
01:30:18,379 --> 01:30:21,087
We can sleep in your bed.

1009
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:23,259
Okay.

1010
01:30:42,336 --> 01:30:44,816
You sleep on the side of the wall,
okay?

1011
01:31:07,862 --> 01:31:09,864
Should I turn off the lights?

1012
01:31:10,031 --> 01:31:11,339
Yeah.

1013
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:40,635
Fer...

1014
01:31:42,296 --> 01:31:45,800
- Hey, man...
- What's the matter?

1015
01:31:46,067 --> 01:31:48,377
Come with me to get some pastries.

1016
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:51,677
Lucho took my car to take
Guada's friend to the capital.

1017
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:53,719
Just go on foot.

1018
01:31:53,841 --> 01:31:55,843
Come on, man! Take me in your car.

1019
01:31:56,110 --> 01:31:57,953
Just go on foot.
It's really nearby.

1020
01:31:58,012 --> 01:32:00,458
I'm not going to go on foot.
Come on, get up!

1021
01:32:00,982 --> 01:32:03,656
I always go.
You guys are so lazy!

1022
01:32:06,654 --> 01:32:08,497
I'll go with you.

1023
01:32:44,792 --> 01:32:45,793
What happened?

1024
01:32:45,893 --> 01:32:47,873
The chick's amazing!

1025
01:32:48,062 --> 01:32:51,942
We were making out
next to the tennis court.

1026
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:57,472
At one point, she looks at the shed
and says "What's in there?"

1027
01:32:57,805 --> 01:32:59,079
And that was it.

1028
01:32:59,206 --> 01:33:02,085
She pulled down my pants
and started sucking my cock...

1029
01:33:02,243 --> 01:33:04,052
It was awesome!

1030
01:33:04,979 --> 01:33:08,017
Then I went to the bedroom
to get the condoms

1031
01:33:08,149 --> 01:33:10,186
and this idiot
didn't want to give me any.

1032
01:33:10,918 --> 01:33:12,056
Nah...

1033
01:33:13,154 --> 01:33:15,498
But I thought the girl
was really faithful,

1034
01:33:15,656 --> 01:33:18,000
or at least
that's what Guada says.

1035
01:33:18,259 --> 01:33:21,729
Maybe since both of them are
in a relationship, she didn't care.

1036
01:33:22,163 --> 01:33:24,336
But if Lucho hadn't told me
that he saw it,

1037
01:33:24,498 --> 01:33:26,171
I wouldn't have believed it.

1038
01:33:26,334 --> 01:33:28,678
Why were you spying on us,
you cocksucker?

1039
01:33:28,869 --> 01:33:31,076
If I had seen you, I would've
beaten the crap outta you.

1040
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:32,444
I'm serious.

1041
01:33:32,573 --> 01:33:34,211
That's not right.

1042
01:33:34,375 --> 01:33:37,015
You screwed the girl I'd been
flirting with all afternoon,

1043
01:33:37,111 --> 01:33:38,818
with my condoms...

1044
01:33:39,347 --> 01:33:42,191
The least I could do
was watch her in action a little.

1045
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:48,423
You always say Leo's a cocksucker,

1046
01:33:48,689 --> 01:33:51,295
but you were watching her
suck on my cock.

1047
01:33:51,726 --> 01:33:53,933
Yeah... Yeah right, you cocksucker.

1048
01:33:54,128 --> 01:33:56,130
You perverted voyeur.

1049
01:33:57,898 --> 01:33:59,377
What's the matter with you?

1050
01:34:08,242 --> 01:34:09,846
I'm pissing myself.

1051
01:34:17,385 --> 01:34:18,762
Are you coming with me?

1052
01:35:05,633 --> 01:35:07,670
Hey, Fer's a good fighter,
right?

1053
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:10,478
We don't fight.

1054
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:13,351
We just train.

1055
01:35:15,810 --> 01:35:20,782
But Fer's the best.
Everyone loves him.

1056
01:35:21,882 --> 01:35:23,691
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

1057
01:35:25,386 --> 01:35:29,232
When we were kids
and we went out dancing,

1058
01:35:29,724 --> 01:35:32,204
a couple of times
we got into fights with people.

1059
01:35:32,326 --> 01:35:35,330
But he was always there for us.

1060
01:35:35,796 --> 01:35:37,935
He'd always defend us...

1061
01:35:38,966 --> 01:35:41,412
Anyone. He was always the first one
to defend anyone.

1062
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:44,315
It's too bad...

1063
01:35:45,506 --> 01:35:48,214
he's head over heels in love
with a friend of my girlfriend's.

1064
01:35:49,143 --> 01:35:53,421
It's been ages,
but he's still in love with her.

1065
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:57,290
The four of us used to double date.

1066
01:35:57,384 --> 01:36:00,160
We went on vacation together once.

1067
01:36:01,655 --> 01:36:05,467
But since the girl left him,
he hasn't been with anyone else.

1068
01:36:06,861 --> 01:36:08,033
It's crazy.

1069
01:36:09,263 --> 01:36:11,243
- Didn't he tell you?
- No.

1070
01:36:11,599 --> 01:36:13,101
No, I didn't know.

1071
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:15,180
Yeah, he's head-over-heels in love.

1072
01:36:15,402 --> 01:36:17,848
He doesn't even talk
about the girl though, you know?

1073
01:36:18,105 --> 01:36:21,211
He didn't tell you, but I know.

1074
01:36:21,342 --> 01:36:23,447
I've known Fer for a long time

1075
01:36:23,944 --> 01:36:26,117
and I know he's in love.

1076
01:36:26,347 --> 01:36:28,293
Even though he doesn't mention her.

1077
01:36:28,549 --> 01:36:30,028
He's crazy about her.

1078
01:36:30,184 --> 01:36:33,893
If the girl wanted to get back
together with him,

1079
01:36:34,021 --> 01:36:36,126
he wouldn't think twice.

1080
01:36:36,524 --> 01:36:38,060
I'm sure he wouldn't.

1081
01:37:21,735 --> 01:37:24,215
Hey, your friend,
the one with the weed, is here.

1082
01:37:24,305 --> 01:37:25,909
- Seba?
- Yeah.

1083
01:37:26,307 --> 01:37:28,787
He looks like a real bum.

1084
01:37:32,479 --> 01:37:34,186
- Did he tell you anything?
- No.

1085
01:37:37,351 --> 01:37:38,557
Thanks, Seba.

1086
01:37:38,686 --> 01:37:39,824
Awesome.

1087
01:37:41,255 --> 01:37:43,098
I came in, he opened the door...

1088
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:44,267
And when I saw all those
straight guys in the pool,

1089
01:37:44,291 --> 01:37:45,736
I almost died.

1090
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:48,807
One of them, the big blond guy,
was in his underwear.

1091
01:37:48,929 --> 01:37:52,206
He took it off
and put on his bathing suit.

1092
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,001
I went crazy.

1093
01:37:54,134 --> 01:37:56,114
They said "Get in the pool."

1094
01:37:56,170 --> 01:37:59,845
I thought if I got in the pool,
I'd turn into a mermaid

1095
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:01,678
and I'd be exposed.

1096
01:38:03,510 --> 01:38:06,320
I'm dying to have sex
with all of them.

1097
01:38:07,948 --> 01:38:10,326
So what's up with that guy?
Fernando, right?

1098
01:38:10,451 --> 01:38:11,451
Yeah.

1099
01:38:12,286 --> 01:38:14,163
I don't know what's up with him.

1100
01:38:14,521 --> 01:38:16,330
I'm kind of confused.

1101
01:38:16,790 --> 01:38:19,236
I don't get it.
We're together all the time

1102
01:38:19,627 --> 01:38:21,573
and he keeps looking at me.

1103
01:38:22,196 --> 01:38:24,005
He laughs a lot.

1104
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:30,509
Last night we slept together
and in the middle of the night,

1105
01:38:30,571 --> 01:38:34,519
I felt his hard cock
against my leg.

1106
01:38:35,976 --> 01:38:39,185
But I don't know,
because we were sleeping.

1107
01:38:39,313 --> 01:38:42,419
You're slow. I would've gone down
to drink from the hose.

1108
01:38:43,851 --> 01:38:47,230
No, no, no. I don't know.

1109
01:38:49,356 --> 01:38:52,963
I was just talking to Leo,
the guy we came with,

1110
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:55,267
and he confused me even more.

1111
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:01,277
That Leo guy stares a lot.

1112
01:39:01,502 --> 01:39:03,106
I think he's gay.

1113
01:39:03,170 --> 01:39:04,945
I don't know.
That's the impression I got.

1114
01:39:05,005 --> 01:39:07,110
I think he's gay too.

1115
01:39:33,534 --> 01:39:35,480
You suck, Fatso!

1116
01:39:40,641 --> 01:39:43,315
There's the fucking ball,
you idiot!

1117
01:39:43,711 --> 01:39:46,157
- Take it easy!
- He said I suck!

1118
01:39:46,213 --> 01:39:48,591
Relax, Diego!

1119
01:39:51,318 --> 01:39:53,195
Who do you think you are? Messi?

1120
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:54,799
Milky butt.

1121
01:40:00,894 --> 01:40:02,498
Here you go, Meathead.

1122
01:40:04,932 --> 01:40:07,071
There you go, you idiot!

1123
01:40:07,334 --> 01:40:09,678
He's been cheating all day!

1124
01:40:09,837 --> 01:40:12,841
And you guys don't say anything.
You play dumb too.

1125
01:40:12,973 --> 01:40:14,111
Shut up, man!

1126
01:40:14,174 --> 01:40:16,017
Don't tell me to shut up!

1127
01:40:16,410 --> 01:40:17,753
Forget it.

1128
01:40:25,686 --> 01:40:27,029
Hi!

1129
01:40:28,022 --> 01:40:29,865
- How are you, Piojo?
- What's up?

1130
01:40:30,190 --> 01:40:31,191
Everything's fine.

1131
01:40:37,765 --> 01:40:38,869
<i>(How are you guy's WW)?</i>

1132
01:40:40,701 --> 01:40:45,013
The cops took our bags
like they were going to check them.

1133
01:40:45,272 --> 01:40:51,450
I wasn't worried, because
I didn't have anything at the time.

1134
01:40:52,146 --> 01:40:55,457
But at one point, someone
started talking louder

1135
01:40:55,649 --> 01:40:58,289
in another language.
That made us more nervous

1136
01:40:58,452 --> 01:41:00,659
because we couldn't understand
what they were saying.

1137
01:41:02,156 --> 01:41:07,606
I turn around and I see
a huge blonde woman

1138
01:41:07,895 --> 01:41:10,341
with my jean jacket in her hand...

1139
01:41:10,497 --> 01:41:13,000
She was holding it
as if it were dirty.

1140
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:17,348
And in the other hand,
she was wearing a blue glove

1141
01:41:17,404 --> 01:41:19,884
and holding some shrooms,
like evidence.

1142
01:41:20,074 --> 01:41:23,749
When I saw that I realized
that I had something...

1143
01:41:24,044 --> 01:41:27,025
But when I saw the jacket,

1144
01:41:27,147 --> 01:41:30,822
I realized that I had had
that jacket for five years

1145
01:41:30,918 --> 01:41:32,295
and I hadn't washed it,

1146
01:41:32,419 --> 01:41:34,030
so those shrooms had been in there
for a long time.

1147
01:41:34,054 --> 01:41:36,557
They were all old and dry,

1148
01:41:36,690 --> 01:41:38,294
so they weren't effective anymore.

1149
01:41:38,392 --> 01:41:40,201
They analyzed them

1150
01:41:40,394 --> 01:41:42,897
and realized there was no problem.

1151
01:41:43,030 --> 01:41:46,068
They had us there for a while...

1152
01:41:46,166 --> 01:41:50,114
In the end we even laughed
about it together

1153
01:41:50,370 --> 01:41:53,317
and that was it. They let us go.

1154
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:56,649
So luckily I'm here
and I can tell about it.

1155
01:41:57,111 --> 01:41:58,454
I'm free.

1156
01:41:58,779 --> 01:42:02,317
So I brought you a couple of...

1157
01:42:02,549 --> 01:42:05,530
a couple of interesting things
for you to have fun tonight.

1158
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:07,956
So enjoy it.

1159
01:42:08,122 --> 01:42:10,398
We can get in the pool later,
if you want.

1160
01:43:48,121 --> 01:43:49,964
Do you want to go to the pool?

1161
01:43:50,691 --> 01:43:51,999
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1162
01:44:35,402 --> 01:44:37,404
- Is my eye red?
- Let me see.

1163
01:44:48,682 --> 01:44:49,854
Lucho...

1164
01:44:51,852 --> 01:44:53,456
- Did you guys get some rest?
- Yeah.

1165
01:44:53,687 --> 01:44:55,064
The guys already left.

1166
01:44:55,122 --> 01:44:57,068
They didn't want to wake you up.

1167
01:44:58,058 --> 01:45:00,732
Leo got up early
and started getting on our nerves.

1168
01:45:01,061 --> 01:45:03,063
He took everyone, Maxi, Fede...

1169
01:45:03,363 --> 01:45:06,242
We're going to go back
in a van later.

1170
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:09,040
You have to leave the car
to your Mom, right?

1171
01:45:09,102 --> 01:45:11,605
Yeah, because she needs it.

1172
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:14,312
We'll help you clean up later.

1173
01:45:15,642 --> 01:45:18,282
Are you staying till tomorrow?

1174
01:45:18,412 --> 01:45:19,288
Yeah.

1175
01:45:19,413 --> 01:45:21,359
I'll clean up with him.

1176
01:45:24,618 --> 01:45:26,154
We'll be back in a while.

1177
01:45:26,753 --> 01:45:27,753
See ya.

1178
01:45:43,003 --> 01:45:46,644
- Do you wanna go?
- Let's go.

1179
01:46:37,958 --> 01:46:39,266
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1180
01:46:39,359 --> 01:46:40,895
One, two, three.

1181
01:47:40,053 --> 01:47:42,033
Did you have a good time?

1182
01:47:43,023 --> 01:47:45,299
Yeah... I had a great time.

1183
01:50:11,504 --> 01:50:13,711
Can I kiss you?
