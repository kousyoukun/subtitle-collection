1
00:01:32,900 --> 00:02:09,900
That's Juancho.

2
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,220
The house is huge.

3
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,420
Yeah, it wasn't this big
when I was a kid.

4
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,060
The last things they built
were the rooms upstairs

5
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,420
and in the back,
the sauna, Jacuzzi

6
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,420
the massage room.

7
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,900
- Wow! That's great!
- It's amazing. Very relaxing.

8
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,220
At one point
my dad set up a spa

9
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,220
and a rehabilitation center
for smokers.

10
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,220
That's great.

11
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,900
Yeah, a group of people would
come here and stay for a week

12
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,580
and they'd stop smoking.

13
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,860
- A tennis court and pool.
- That's great!

14
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,900
Two of them came
on Saturday night...

15
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:49,220
Maxi, the blond, and Tomi.
They're sleeping there.

16
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,860
And there's Diego.

17
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,220
Fede! Is everything alright?

18
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,500
- What's up?
- I'm GermÃ©n. Nice to meet you.

19
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,420
How are you?
Did you sleep well?

20
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,660
Yeah, but I went to sleep late.
We stayed up late.

21
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,340
I was really stoned.

22
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:10,100
Lucho and Maxi were wasted.
We were laughing our heads off.

23
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,860
We ended up in the pool.

24
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,420
And Juan, who was wasted too,

25
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,420
threw Diego into the pool.

26
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,500
- No! He must've been pissed.
- Yeah, with his clothes on.

27
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,260
I think he even had
his cell phone on him.

28
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,100
No way!

29
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,420
Yeah, I think he did,
because of how pissed off he was.

30
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,100
Yeah, he was furious.
I went away.

31
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,500
I didn't want any trouble.

32
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,460
That's a typical day here.

33
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,580
Yeah, that's true.

34
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,220
Do you want mate or coffee?

35
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,980
I'm going to show him the room
and then we'll come downstairs.

36
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,500
Alright.

37
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,700
Hey, man, put on
some swim trunks or something.

38
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,220
This guy goes around naked all day.

39
00:03:53,220 --> 00:04:00,980
Nice to meet you.

40
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,740
Hi, what's up?

41
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,860
- Hi, GermÃ©n.
- How are you? Diego.

42
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,900
Is everything alright?

43
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,300
I went to take a dump upstairs because
the other bathroom's full of puke.

44
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,620
There too?

45
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,420
Lucho threw up before going to sleep
and it's still there...

46
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,700
pieces of carrot and everything.

47
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,900
And I told you to come here
to relax for a few days,

48
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,900
but that doesn't seem to be the plan
for this weekend.

49
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,180
Did you come by train?

50
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,980
Yeah, the trip was amazing.
I loved it.

51
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,540
- Yeah, I came on that train too.
- I never came on that train.

52
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,780
- They say it's great.
- Yeah.

53
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,700
- Did you guys have breakfast?
- No, but Fede's making some mate.

54
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,780
I'm going to show him his room

55
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,540
and then we'll come down
for breakfast.

56
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,300
- Okay?
- Okay! great?

57
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,734
Thanks.

58
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:57,220
- What are you eating, Fatso?
- An egg. I was hungry.

59
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:02,900
What's up?

60
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,780
I just had an awesome lucid dream.

61
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,900
Yeah?

62
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,260
- What does "lucid" mean?
- That it's real. It's very real.

63
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,540
What did you dream?

64
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,980
I was in Tigre, at my sister's house,

65
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,500
next to the river.

66
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,900
I don't know what I was doing,
or who I was with, but I was there.

67
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,540
And?

68
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:31,740
Everything was the same,
the house, the grill in the backyard.

69
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,140
I don't know why I went inside
and went up the stairs.

70
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,340
I went up three floors.

71
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,420
But I think
it's a one-story house.

72
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,980
- What?
- I think it's a one-story house.

73
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,220
And when I got to the terrace,

74
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,660
the water was at the level
of the balcony.

75
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,780
There was a lot of water.

76
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,540
It was as if there were a waterfall
a hundred yards away.

77
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,820
Yeah.

78
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,460
But I had gone up two floors

79
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:08,220
so there couldn't be water
on both levels,

80
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,660
So then I realized it was a dream.

81
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,820
And whenever I realize that,
I feel like having sex...

82
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,340
so I started walking,
knowing I could wake up any minute.

83
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,340
I passed a bridge.

84
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,660
I went inside this place with bars,
like a nightclub.

85
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,340
And I started making out
with the first chick I saw.

86
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,460
I took off her clothes,

87
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,340
I started sucking her tits
and her pussy really hard.

88
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,180
And the chick just stood there.

89
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,780
You know like in dreams when
the characters suddenly stop moving?

90
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,220
- Yeah, that's weird.
- Yeah.

91
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,900
And at one point,
her pussy started getting sandy...

92
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,860
and... bam! I got up.

93
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,580
I opened my eyes and looked at
the ceiling. I thought "Damn it!"

94
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,380
But it was cool while it lasted.

95
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,700
The part about the sand
freaked me out.

96
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,980
Yeah.

97
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:05,100
But it was so real
that I can still taste her pussy.

98
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,540
- Sweet!
- It was really pink and delicious!

99
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,780
- We have to call some girls over.
- We need it, huh?

100
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,180
Yeah.

101
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,256
Alright.

102
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,700
- Mario Bros isn't a cartoon, man.
- Yeah it is.

103
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,180
No, man, that's what
you didn't get yesterday.

104
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,220
Mario Bros isn't a cartoon.

105
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:38,820
You guys said it was
and I said it wasn't.

106
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,300
That's why I think I didn't lose.

107
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,340
Did you used to watch
Mario Bros cartoons?

108
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,420
It's the same thing.
It's like a cartoon.

109
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,380
You just can't admit that you lost
because you couldn't guess

110
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,820
and now you're saying that if we
had told you it wasn't a cartoon,

111
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,220
you would've guessed,

112
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,740
and then you would've said
that it's a kind of cartoon.

113
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,060
Come on, Diego. I know you!

114
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,580
See how competitive you are?

115
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,660
I couldn't care less!
You're the one who's competitive!

116
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,220
I hate it when people mix up
the actors, the people,

117
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,700
with characters.

118
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,140
One time Fatso got Jack Sparrow

119
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,060
and when he asked if it was an actor,
you said yes.

120
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,820
No! The actor's Johnny Depp.

121
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,740
Jack Sparrow worked as a pirate.

122
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,260
-"Worked as a pirate"?
- Yeah!

123
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,500
Now being a pirate's a job.

124
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,580
I hate it when you don't understand
the example. It pisses me off.

125
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,245
You're so competitive.

126
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,516
Come on, Diego!

127
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,260
Hey, Fatso, have you seen Fer?

128
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,562
Fatso!

129
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:39,860
The chick flirts with me
when we're all working...

130
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,540
and then she plays hard-to-get.

131
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,220
- I mean...
- Like how?

132
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,860
We were going to Pablo's house.
You know the guy with long hair?

133
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,860
Yeah.

134
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,220
Okay, Pablo, Agus, the chick and me.

135
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,420
Pablo and Agus went
to buy some beer

136
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,300
and the girl and I were alone.

137
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,740
I sat next to her because
she wanted to show me a message

138
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,380
and the girl gave me
the cold shoulder.

139
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,860
She was cold as ice.
She went to the bathroom.

140
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,980
She always act like that,
hysterical.

141
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,100
The next day at work,
in front of everyone,

142
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,100
she walked in, kissed me here
and gave me a neck massage.

143
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,180
She always does the same thing.

144
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,220
She's crazy.

145
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,900
Forget about her.

146
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,500
Yeah.

147
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,850
- Have you guys seen Fer?
- No.

148
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,780
So?

149
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,380
Are you sure the girl doesn't
know you're in a relationship?

150
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,340
No, man, I'm sure.

151
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,940
Girls find out about those things.

152
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,900
There's no way she could know.
And I don't think the guys told her,

153
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,700
because they know
I want to screw her...

154
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:57,820
Right.

155
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,700
- It's okay.
- Yeah.

156
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,266
But you have a girlfriend.

157
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,756
To each his own.

158
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,780
- I found this one.
- Yeah.

159
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,060
But it's almost empty.

160
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,900
The mosquitoes are killing me.

161
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,100
Here you go...

162
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,420
As soon as I came in
they started to bite me too.

163
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,140
They bit you all over!

164
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,100
Look here...

165
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,420
No way, man!

166
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,180
They bit me all over!

167
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,940
Here...

168
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,860
Here...

169
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:08,460
And here too.

170
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,820
As I was saying...

171
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:15,300
Diego and Juan the longest.

172
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,580
I've them since we were
in kindergarten.

173
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:22,900
But we're all very good friends.

174
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,260
We met the rest later on.

175
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:31,660
In primary school, we met Lucho,
Leo and Tomi.

176
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:40,660
And Maxi used to go out
with Tomi's sister.

177
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,540
He used to play soccer with us
all the time,

178
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,460
so we started getting along
really well with him.

179
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,620
And we met Fatso in eleventh grade.

180
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,460
I think he had failed five
or six times. We lost track.

181
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,740
Yeah, you can tell he's older.

182
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,260
And you're not going to meet
Santiago today,

183
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:02,980
because he moved to Spain
when he met a Spanish girl here.

184
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,220
He used to come back
every two or three months,

185
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:12,620
but then he started coming here
less frequently.

186
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,620
I don't think he'd come back now,

187
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,260
if he didn't come back
two years ago.

188
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,580
<i>Leo...</i>

189
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,630
Hi.

190
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,285
Well, I'm going to the pool.

191
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,060
You do karate with Fer, right?

192
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,620
It's not karate, you idiot.

193
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,420
- It's the same thing.
- It's not the same thing.

194
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,860
Yeah, I used to do karate,
but when I moved to Adrogué,

195
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:34,100
I started doing taekwondo,
because that's all they had there.

196
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,620
I did it to do some kind of sport.

197
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,660
I don't like it that much.
I don't have a belt or anything.

198
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:45,420
I don't know if I'm going to
get different color belts.

199
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,980
You work at the pool bar
at San Martin Square, right?

200
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,100
Yeah.

201
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,540
We saw you there one day
with Fer, right?

202
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,340
Yeah, actually,
that's where we met.

203
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,860
We started talking a lot

204
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,300
and he told me
to try out the club,

205
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,300
so we became friends.

206
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,500
Are you studying anything?

207
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,220
I used to study architecture
and I dropped out.

208
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,580
- Where?
- In La Plata.

209
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,460
- Nice!
- Yeah, I liked it...

210
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,340
I like to draw,

211
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:12,100
but I'd rather draw things
like comic book illustrations...

212
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,500
Real drawings.

213
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,140
So anyway...
I'd love to draw for a living.

214
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,900
But it's very hard
to find the right connections.

215
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,500
- Fer has a big comic book collection.
- Yeah.

216
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,660
Have you guys seen it?
It's huge!

217
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,100
Yeah.

218
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,540
- Should I roll a blunt?
- Please.

219
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,845
Yeah, okay.

220
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,860
Hey, what's up?
Is everything alright?

221
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,803
Yeah.

222
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,741
THE CATCHER IN THE RYE

223
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,380
Are you enjoying it?

224
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,860
It's awesome.

225
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,860
He's a great writer.

226
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,206
Yeah, he is.

227
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,861
What are you doing, man?

228
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,740
Lucho, you were a total chicken!

229
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,900
I'd be scared of Fatso too.

230
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:26,060
Yeah, man, stop overdoing it.
It's not a World Cup.

231
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,540
You kick too hard.

232
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:33,860
I said I'm not gonna beat you up
because you're weak,

233
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,540
but if you keep bothering me,
I'll beat the crap outta you.

234
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,540
So are your friends coming here
on Saturday or not?

235
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,380
You always act like you're faithful,

236
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,060
but you're dying
to meet those girls. What the hell?

237
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,260
You're so gay!

238
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,100
Shut up!

239
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,060
Don't be gay!

240
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,420
I just want some eye candy,
that's all.

241
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,740
But are they coming?

242
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,180
When they saw there were
eight of us, they left early.

243
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,700
Well, Maca said
she wasn't coming,

244
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,940
but if we throw a party,
she'll come with more friends.

245
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,940
The other day,
it was eight of us against four.

246
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,940
There can't be two of us for each.

247
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,660
It's not like
we're going to make porn.

248
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,100
- But Juan screwed one of them.
- Yeah.

249
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,460
They're no prudes.

250
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,980
I didn't screw the other one
because she knows I have a girlfriend,

251
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,860
otherwise, I would've done it.

252
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,879
Totally.

253
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,943
- Did you buy chocolate milk?
- Yeah.

254
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,820
Hey, Germán,
are you in a relationship?

255
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,260
He's Fer's boyfriend.

256
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,100
Are you jealous,
you cock-sucking pussy?

257
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,220
No, I'm single.

258
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,660
If I looked like Brad Pitt

259
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,540
and girls hit on me
like they probably hit on this guy,

260
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,220
I wouldn't stop fooling around
until I'm in my forties

261
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,660
and then I'd start thinking
about a relationship.

262
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,860
You always want a girlfriend
to cheat on her with sluts.

263
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,500
The only faithful guy here
is Tomás.

264
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,900
I'm pretty faithful too, man.

265
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,580
Yeah, right.

266
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,140
It's not like girls are
faithful either.

267
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,500
I don't believe that at all.

268
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,420
Of course not.
They're just like us, or worse.

269
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,180
They're just really sly.

270
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:12,766
They get away with it
and you never find out.

271
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:35,580
I don't know what's up with the guy.

272
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:40,660
What I do know is that
he doesn't have a girlfriend.

273
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:44,300
I'm not making it up, man.

274
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:50,500
Why did he invite me?

275
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:55,340
I don't know.

276
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,580
Your head would explode
if you were here.

277
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:04,620
They walk around naked all the time.

278
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:09,260
Hey, today they asked me
if I was in a relationship...

279
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,540
and I said no.

280
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,660
No, man. I didn't lie.

281
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,420
They didn't ask me
if I had a girlfriend.

282
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,860
No, I didn't lie.

283
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:26,780
And Fer was just listening.

284
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,340
Are you stupid?

285
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,380
Fer's the guy.

286
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,500
If some chicks come here
and he screws one of them,

287
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:40,460
I'll just die.

288
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:49,540
Yeah.

289
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,860
I don't know.
I'm just going to stay here.

290
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:57,060
I'm going to play dumb for a while
and see what he does.

291
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:01,940
I don't know.

292
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,700
You're so stupid.

293
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,540
Okay, bye, bye-

294
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,821
Bye.

295
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,500
Hi.

296
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,860
- How are you?
- Fine.

297
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,700
Great.

298
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,580
Sorry to bother you,
but I'm about to make a barbecue

299
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,300
and we don't have any newspapers.

300
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,540
- Do you have any?
- Yeah, I'm sure we have some.

301
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,980
- I'll bring you some.
- Thanks.

302
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,980
- Hi.
- Hi.

303
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:10,620
Hi.

304
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,180
Hi.

305
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,180
- Hi.
- Hi.

306
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,538
- How are you?
- Fine.

307
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:22,401
- There are so many of you.
- Yeah.

308
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,442
- Nice weather, huh?
- Yeah.

309
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,540
How are the girls?

310
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,500
Fine.

311
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,860
You should make them wear
sunscreen. The sun's really burning.

312
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:46,220
Yeah, I know.
But they're inside right now,

313
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:50,380
otherwise they can't
get to sleep at night.

314
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,799
There he is.

315
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,220
- Is this enough?
- Yeah, this is great.

316
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,660
- Yeah?
- Thanks.

317
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,700
If you need more,
just let us know.

318
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,180
- Okay, thanks.
- Bye.

319
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,383
- Bye! guys!
- Bye-bye.

320
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,860
She was cute!

321
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:18,340
Really cute!

322
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,140
You voted for the wrong guy,
admit it.

323
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,900
I don't know.
I have no idea about politics.

324
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,540
I shouldnâ€™t have even told you.

325
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,900
If you have no idea,
you should go and ask.

326
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,900
I'm not saying you have
to understand,

327
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,260
but you're old enough
to not vote for just anyone.

328
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,460
You're not choosing
where you're going to go on vacation.

329
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,740
Right?

330
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,210
There's a whole bunch
of stuff at play.

331
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:47,780
You should've asked me about it,
or your dad.

332
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,860
Well, not your dad...

333
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,300
But you should've asked around
a little,

334
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,940
so at least you know
what you're voting for.

335
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:00,540
Or would you screw a girl
without a condom

336
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:04,340
just because she says
she's on the pill?

337
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:08,940
It depends how hot she is.

338
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,220
- But that's a bad example.
- Why?

339
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,540
Because you supposedly
trust the girl.

340
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,540
You don't think
she's gonna lie to you.

341
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,620
But if you vote for the wrong person,

342
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,220
you end up taking it up the butt.

343
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,620
They say they're gonna give you
a back massage

344
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,140
and they end up sticking it
up your butt.

345
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,580
If they stick it up your butt,
at least it should be

346
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,259
because you want to feel it inside.

347
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,173
Hey, you really look Argentinian.

348
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,780
What do you mean?

349
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,820
- What do you look like?
- Spanish.

350
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,420
And me?

351
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:48,260
French. All you need
is a beret and a paintbrush.

352
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,580
What about me?

353
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,980
Italian.

354
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,380
Fatso looks Russian.

355
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,740
Tomás looks Arabian.

356
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:59,655
Leo looks German
and Diego looks Swedish.

357
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,958
What do I look like?

358
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,940
You look English.

359
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,133
You look like
an English soccer player.

360
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:36,500
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

361
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,220
eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,

362
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,540
seventeen, eighteen, nineteen,
twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two,

363
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,100
twenty-three, twenty-four,
twenty-five,

364
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,620
twenty-six, twenty-seven,
twenty-eight,

365
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,564
twenty-nine, thirty!

366
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:47,900
What's the matter with you?
You're always cheating!

367
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,060
- What happened?
- Did you hear that?

368
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,540
You're always cheating, man!

369
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,300
You can't play like that!

370
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,580
Stop!

371
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,060
Stop it, Leo!

372
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,500
You moron!

373
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,860
Who are you calling a moron?

374
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,540
He's an idiot! He keeps cheating!
I can't play like this!

375
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,580
- Stop it, Leo.
- Relax...

376
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,100
Stop it!

377
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,660
Stop, Leo!

378
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,820
It's not a championship.
You get too worked up.

379
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,980
They why are we playing?

380
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,104
Take it easy! And you too!

381
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,409
I'm gonna score.

382
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,660
Pass the blunt, man.
You're smoking it all by yourself.

383
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,940
Don't get upset, man.

384
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,580
We were just playing
and you got really pissed off!

385
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:03,460
But if we're playing and you cheat,
it sucks. You can't do that!

386
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:06,500
- Stop being such a pussy!
- What are you talking about, asshole?

387
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,420
We were just fooling around
for a while!

388
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:16,620
- You're a jerk, man.
- Go fuck yourself!

389
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:23,180
Let me have some.

390
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,253
Mother fucker...

391
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:07,340
Milo Manara.

392
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,060
Milo Manara?

393
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,220
Don't you know him?

394
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,860
He's an Italian...

395
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:19,980
A genius. My dad had
a bunch of his comic books.

396
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:24,300
I know the classic ones more,
the American ones.

397
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:28,060
- Like this one.
- Yeah.

398
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:34,300
My dad had all of Manara's
comic books and Fierro's.

399
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,780
That's cool.

400
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:41,340
I used to take them from my dad
when I was a kid, because...

401
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:45,660
there were naked people in them.
They would really turn me on.

402
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:49,300
At first I thought Milo Manara
was the name of the main character,

403
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:54,740
but when I was older l realized
it was the name of the artist.

404
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:58,060
Actually, "Click"
is his most well-known comic...

405
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,820
Well the one I know the best.

406
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:06,100
It was about a guy who had put
a device in a girl...

407
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,540
and he'd click a remote control
that would make her have orgasms.

408
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,140
He'd click it
and she'd have an orgasm.

409
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:15,500
And he'd spy on her. It was amazing.

410
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,860
It blew your mind.

411
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:20,100
Actually, I should ask my dad for it
and read it again,

412
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,763
It's crazy... crazy.

413
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:36,700
When I was in school,
I used to draw a lot of superheroes.

414
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:43,060
One day, some friends of mine
made a magazine.

415
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,860
It was a school magazine...

416
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:50,300
It was a magazine for the school,
like an alternative magazine.

417
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,460
Yeah.

418
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:57,540
And one day they asked me to do
a two-page comic.

419
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,220
I had to do everything...

420
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:03,140
The drawings, the dialogs...

421
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,500
The whole comic, you know?

422
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,940
- And did they publish it?
- Yeah.

423
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,660
- That's cool!
- Yeah, really cool.

424
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,900
To see your work published.

425
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:15,540
Yeah. And what I would do was...

426
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:19,260
I used to use
other people's material a little...

427
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:23,540
Actually, I mostly adapted
story lines from short stories,

428
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,180
like Cortázar's.

429
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,540
Cool!

430
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,860
It was cool, because
they were superheroes,

431
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:33,500
but with a more surrealist style...

432
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,860
Like the characters' background.

433
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:38,700
Yeah, it was like a dream.
It was cool.

434
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,751
Amazing.

435
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,940
Do you want to go to sleep?

436
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:52,249
Yeah... Okay.

437
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:59,460
Hey, Leo...

438
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:03,500
<i>Leo...</i>

439
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,460
Come on, Leo. Go to your bed.

440
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,460
Come on, Leo.

441
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:15,660
This guy always does the same thing.

442
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:19,780
Okay, I'll go sleep downstairs.

443
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:22,173
- See you tomorrow.
- Alright.

444
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,220
Guada?

445
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:07,380
- Yeah.
- What's the matter?

446
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:11,260
She wants me to go with her
to the party,

447
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,140
But that's not it. I know her.

448
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,940
She's jealous.

449
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,860
She asked me if there were
any girls here.

450
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:21,100
She doesn't believe me when
I say that no girls came over,

451
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:25,580
none of your friends.

452
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:29,500
We spent two great weeks
in Ostende,

453
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,540
but now she doesn't understand
that I want to be with you guys.

454
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:36,740
It's not that I don't want
to be with her.

455
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:40,500
She's great. You know her.
She's really sweet,

456
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,900
but she can be really insecure

457
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:48,129
and it gets on my nerves.

458
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,340
I know I have my flaws,

459
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:59,212
but I don't get jealous.

460
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:09,420
You shouldn't pay attention to her.

461
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,220
It's her problem, man.

462
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:18,860
Let her figure it out,
even if it hurts.

463
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:22,460
What are you going to do?
Go back to Buenos Aires?

464
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:26,060
You're going to get upset
and you won't be able to relax.

465
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,540
Because you're fine here with us.

466
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:36,180
So you're going to be pissed off
and you guys are going to fight.

467
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,820
Tomi...

468
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,500
Forget it.

469
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,460
Don't forget that you met her
when you were with Lucia.

470
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:47,860
So it's natural
that she'd be scared and insecure.

471
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:51,660
Yeah, I know that, but...

472
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,740
I really love her.

473
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:58,035
I'd die if I couldn't be with her.

474
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,380
Hey, man...

475
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,060
Germán's pretty weird.

476
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:29,700
I just went into Fer's room
and he was going through his bag.

477
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:35,820
I can't believe you, man.
You're always making things up.

478
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:39,900
Fernando and that guy have been
training together all year.

479
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:45,140
Fer told me he really trusts him.

480
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,620
You're just a cocksucker,
that's the problem.

481
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:54,100
So you make things up.
I know you.

482
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,820
Look at Diego
going through my bag.

483
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:00,420
Is this your bag?

484
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:05,300
Hey, what T-shirts did you bring?

485
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:09,420
Can I borrow one?

486
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,100
But give it back to me later.

487
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,620
The other day you were wearing
a sweatshirt of mine

488
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,340
that I had been looking for
for a long time.

489
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,060
Yeah, laugh all you want.
It's true.

490
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:21,940
I just love your clothes.

491
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,380
Okay, stop looking through
my stuff. I'll show you.

492
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,540
- Alright, alright!
- Don't go through everything.

493
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,740
- Alright...
- I don't like it.

494
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,180
There you go.

495
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,805
Thanks.

496
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,500
It's really hard for me
not to get upset.

497
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,180
No one's faster than him, man!

498
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,980
The guy's effective.

499
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:57,820
He doesn't have to make
any fancy moves.

500
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:01,060
They guy's straightforward.
He's simple.

501
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,260
That's why he's the best.

502
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:05,740
Yeah, but you used to say
that Maradona was the best

503
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:08,300
and now because you read
a couple of interviews...

504
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,900
Yeah, I did read a couple
of interviews,

505
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,500
but I've also watched him

506
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:17,620
and he doesn't put on a show
for the cameras like the rest.

507
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:21,860
He's simple and quick

508
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:24,460
and it's also a generational thing.

509
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,380
Times have changed.

510
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:31,540
And I don't agree with the idiots
who say he scores goals abroad

511
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,380
-and here he sucks.
- Yeah, well.

512
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,820
People who say that are idiots.

513
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:36,980
Don't you think?

514
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:40,980
- The guys are here with pastries.
- Awesome!

515
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:44,300
- How are you guys?
- Cool!

516
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,540
What's up, guys?

517
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,900
You wouldn't believe the accident
there was around the corner.

518
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,940
- It's awful.
- Really?

519
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,100
Yeah, yeah.

520
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:56,100
- What happened?
- A crash.

521
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,620
Hey, Fer,
where are we going tomorrow?

522
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,180
I don't know.
Wherever you guys want?

523
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:03,940
We could go to that nightclub
with the pool in the middle

524
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,900
that the guy fell into
with all his clothes on.

525
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,700
Otherwise,
we can go to the capital

526
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,700
and come back at night.

527
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,660
Are you crazy? You want us
to go to the capital?

528
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,860
Let's go somewhere nearer,

529
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,660
otherwise Fer and Leo
won't be able to drive,

530
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:18,740
they won't be able
to drink anything.

531
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,620
Do you want us to come back
wasted like the other day,

532
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,780
when we almost
got ourselves killed?

533
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:25,780
Hey, I'm not dangerous.

534
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:30,380
I don't drink anymore.

535
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,743
Yeah, right.

536
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:42,380
Hey, man,
this meat's like butter.

537
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,260
Don't you think?

538
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,660
The other day, Diego and I
bought meat at the supermarket

539
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,540
and it wasn't like this at all.

540
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,820
This is totally different.

541
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,820
Yeah.

542
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:52,540
And you ate three sausages,
you cocksucker. You must be full.

543
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:55,540
That butt sure imports
a lot of meat.

544
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:59,180
He gave it to me, you idiot.

545
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,660
You're the weirdest
vegetarian I know.

546
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,340
You never eat meat;
you're always really fussy,

547
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,780
but you eat barbecue.

548
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:08,300
But I never say I don't eat meat.

549
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:11,100
I don't go around telling people
that I'm vegetarian.

550
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,340
But it's true.
I hardly ever eat meat.

551
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,100
Only when there's barbecue.

552
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:18,580
The other day, Rocí­o and I
went to a restaurant

553
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,100
and we ordered meat.

554
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,460
But you bother me so much about it.

555
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:28,900
I can eat meat
whenever I feel like it.

556
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,780
So does you girlfriend
eat your meat?

557
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,140
Of course she does.

558
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:34,660
She eats it whole.

559
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:38,460
What about you? You should
probably get a girlfriend too.

560
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:41,180
How long has it been
since this guy had sex?

561
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,140
Like four months.

562
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:46,980
You can't get a girl
to save your life.

563
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:49,552
You don't have to be so mean.

564
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:09,540
Today's December 6,
my mom's birthday.

565
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,725
I have to call her.

566
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:17,900
Lucho's always teasing Leo,
you know?

567
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:21,540
Do you think Leo's really gay?

568
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,620
I don't know.

569
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,380
Maybe.

570
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:29,580
The guy's weird.
He's always been weird.

571
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:34,380
The two girlfriends he had were
the only chicks he's ever screwed.

572
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:40,180
Plus, sometimes he just stares
at you. It's weird.

573
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:43,580
And you don't know
if he's looking at you, at him...

574
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:46,180
or if he likes you.
I don't know. That's what I think.

575
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:50,260
Yeah, yeah. I agree.

576
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:52,780
I don't know. It's also weird
that his two girlfriends

577
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:55,860
are the only girls
he's ever screwed.

578
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:59,540
Now he's with this chick, Rocí­o...

579
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:01,260
but Rocí­o used to go out
with Mono

580
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:05,540
and Mono says
she never wanted to have sex.

581
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:08,500
So I don't know.

582
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,380
- I have an aunt who's a lesbian.
- Yeah.

583
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:14,900
She says that
if you're really bisexual,

584
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,300
you have no trouble
repressing yourself,

585
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,660
because since you like
girls and guys,

586
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,860
if you meet a guy,
it doesn't matter,

587
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:24,820
you can be with him and then go
satisfy your needs with a chick.

588
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:27,740
It's no big deal.
It's easy to repress.

589
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:30,260
So you just leave him there
and that's it.

590
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,060
He's going to be the first
to get married,

591
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:34,540
-whether he's gay or not.
- Yeah, maybe.

592
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,740
And we're going to be there
celebrating it with presents,

593
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:41,180
dancing at his wedding.

594
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:42,782
It's true.

595
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:08,420
You know I love Romi...

596
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:13,260
but I can't say no to girls
who call me for sex.

597
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:16,260
The other day, Romi had to
get some paperwork done.

598
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:17,780
She went to sleep at her house

599
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:24,180
because it was closer
to where she had to go the next day.

600
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:25,380
It's like she's a witch.

601
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:29,940
I don't know if this girl
is psychic or what...

602
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:33,260
Natalia texted me.
Remember Natalia, the skinny girl?

603
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:36,820
Remember? The skinny girl?

604
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:38,740
You wouldn't believe
what she looks like now.

605
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:41,820
She's got a lot more meat
on her bones and a great rack.

606
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:46,420
Man! I took a cab
and went to her house

607
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,980
and we fucked for nine hours.

608
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:51,820
Of course.
What was I supposed to do?

609
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,780
It's natural.

610
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:57,100
Then I got home
and took a shower...

611
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:59,260
and I felt like shit.

612
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:02,460
I felt really guilty.

613
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:06,460
It sucks.

614
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:09,820
The important thing
is that Romi doesn't catch you,

615
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:14,380
because then
you'll want to kill yourself.

616
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:40,540
Hey, I think Germán is kind of gay.

617
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:44,100
You'd know if he was for sure.
It takes one to know one.

618
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:47,100
Stop it, man. Hey...

619
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,780
You keep calling me "cocksucker"
all day long.

620
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,460
"Cocksucker, cocksucker,
cocksucker."

621
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,740
You don't realize it,
but it gets annoying.

622
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,060
I'm sick of it.

623
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:58,100
Plus, I have a girlfriend.

624
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:02,060
You don't realize
I'm just kidding around.

625
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:19,060
Hey, stop! I was here first!

626
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:21,140
Diego, I'm gonna use your shampoo;
it's great!

627
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:22,276
<i>Okay.</i>

628
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,700
Fer, I'm going to take a shower here,

629
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:52,660
because Lucho's using the shower
downstairs and he takes an hour.

630
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:56,980
Alright!

631
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:59,460
What are you reading?

632
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:03,380
"Hunger..."

633
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:06,340
It's Norwegian.

634
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:09,540
I'm going in now.
Are you gonna take much longer?

635
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:12,530
No, come in if you want.

636
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:34,340
Son of a bitch!

637
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,134
I'm gonna kick your ass!

638
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:40,244
Come on, man!

639
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:24,420
We were In tenth or eleventh grade
and we were really stoned.

640
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,940
It was one of the first times
we all smoked together.

641
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:29,780
We were in...

642
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,420
Fatso's grandma's house...

643
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:35,940
in the yard. At one point
I went to his grandma's room.

644
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:39,180
She had died recently...

645
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:43,500
And I saw Leo there...

646
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:47,420
and Fer, making out
in the room.

647
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:49,740
We were just kids
and we were stoned.

648
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:51,860
Besides, we had to experiment
a little, right?

649
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:56,660
No, but I don't think
we were making out, man.

650
00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:00,340
No, I totally remember.
We were making out.

651
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:03,220
It was my bisexual phase.

652
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:06,380
Now I'm totally gay.

653
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:08,540
No, wait a minute.
I really don't remember that.

654
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:12,500
I think we must've been
so stoned that we imagined it,

655
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:15,300
but that's all, man.

656
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:18,420
Well, everyone should be able
to do whatever they want.

657
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:19,860
It's like Juan says,
the more gay guys there are,

658
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,380
the more girls there are for us.

659
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:25,380
The other day,
Fatso and I were at Serrano

660
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:27,540
and he was totally freaking out.

661
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:30,460
"This place is full of gay people!
Cocksuckers!"

662
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:34,540
and Juan said "Take it easy, Fatso.

663
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:36,220
The more gay guys there are,

664
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:38,620
the more chicks there are for us
to choose from."

665
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:40,420
That's how it is.

666
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:42,540
Last time we were...

667
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:46,460
I don't get people who think
that if you go to a gay bar

668
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,780
all the guys are going
to hit on you.

669
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:50,700
It's not true.

670
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:53,300
Gays play hard-to-get
more than girls.

671
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:54,940
I swear it's true.

672
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:58,140
The other day Flor and I
went to a party

673
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:02,060
full of gay Peronists...
You know she's an activist there?

674
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:05,860
And I looked like the gayest guy in
there, with the shirt I was wearing.

675
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:07,660
I'm serious.
No one gave me the time of day.

676
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:10,298
They don't even look at you.
That's how it is.

677
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,740
Wait...

678
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:30,163
Okay, but where are you guys now?

679
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:35,860
Yeah, obviously, man.

680
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:38,580
Yeah. But stay there
at the gas station.

681
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:40,180
I'll be there in half an hour.

682
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:41,820
Okay?

683
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:45,620
Yeah... Alright, man.
Alright!

684
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:47,420
Maxi...

685
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:50,860
Maxi, come with me
to pick Fatso up.

686
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:53,540
He's with Juan.
The girls left him there.

687
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,780
They went to another party.

688
00:54:56,780 --> 00:55:00,140
Maxi...

689
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:01,420
What? Did they have sex?

690
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:04,380
Fatso said he did.
He screwed her in a bathroom.

691
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:07,300
But Juan didn't. He just
made out with her in the yard.

692
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,540
Come on, man. Let's go.

693
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:13,380
- I'm exhausted, man.
- Come on! Don't be inconsiderate!

694
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:16,460
Stop bothering me, man.

695
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:19,730
- Come on, man! Come on!
- Alright!

696
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,009
Let's go.

697
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:41,900
Listen, now you guys
go out and play soccer

698
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:45,780
and let Andrea clean up, please.

699
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:50,940
Okay, but Fede's lying down
because he doesn't feel well.

700
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:53,060
But he won't get in the way.

701
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:55,340
In any case, she can just
not clean that room.

702
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:57,580
Of course, that's no problem.

703
00:59:57,580 --> 00:59:59,780
Who? The boy with the blue eyes?

704
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:01,780
GermÃ©n, a friend of mine
from Taekwondo.

705
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:04,220
He came to our house several
times. You've seen him, right?

706
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:08,620
Yeah, but I didn't know
he was everyone else's friend too.

707
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:11,500
No, he's my friend.
But I told him to come along.

708
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:14,060
Because he was going to go to
the South with a couple of friends

709
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:15,980
and they started dating.

710
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:17,820
They told him
they wanted to go alone,

711
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:20,540
so he had nowhere to go
on vacation.

712
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:23,580
Text me when you finish, okay?

713
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:26,620
I left you your pay
for last week and today.

714
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:27,990
<i>Okay.</i>

715
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:42,528
- Are you alright, Andrea?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

716
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:17,740
- You got my number, right?
- Yeah.

717
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:19,300
<i>Okay.</i>

718
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:22,860
You can send me a missed call
if you want, so...

719
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:25,340
I'll call you later.

720
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:28,460
I have two kids, you know?

721
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:31,100
I'm separated,
but I've got two kids.

722
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:35,580
I can be a good dad
if you give me a chance.

723
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:36,940
What are their names?

724
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:38,300
Lucas and Manuel.

725
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:41,279
- Six and four.
- Nice names.

726
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:09,678
Out!

727
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:24,980
Out!

728
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:26,790
Damn it!

729
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:37,289
Fuck!

730
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:07,740
- Juan...
- What?

731
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:09,540
Roll another one.

732
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:12,340
But there's only enough
for one more.

733
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:21,340
Ger...

734
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:23,380
Didn't you have a friend
who's staying near here

735
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:25,740
who had weed?

736
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:27,180
Yeah.

737
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:29,260
He's near here...

738
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:31,780
Twenty minutes away.

739
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:34,900
Tell him to bring some
and we'll buy some from him.

740
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:38,060
No, he'll bring me some.
It's no problem.

741
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:39,700
He has a bunch of plants.

742
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,260
He's really cool.

743
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:43,622
And he's totally out of his mind.

744
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:49,860
Hey, guys...

745
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:52,540
Let's go buy meat early tomorrow,

746
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:55,740
because the other day we got there
late and there was none left.

747
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:59,820
Hey, Fer! Do you want to go?

748
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:01,940
- Yeah, alright.
- Okay.

749
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:05,500
Hey, Lucho fell asleep.

750
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:11,973
Let's take some pictures of him
and post them for the group.

751
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:30,820
What kind of group?

752
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:31,900
A whatsapp group?

753
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:36,573
Yeah. We always take pictures
of Lucho.

754
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:48,220
Hey... Fer...

755
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:50,620
I'm serious.

756
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:55,740
I'm going to wake you up early
tomorrow.

757
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:58,780
Don't stay up too late.

758
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:01,220
Well, do whatever you want.

759
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:03,540
But I'm waking you up early
tomorrow.

760
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:05,740
Okay, you can come jump on me
if I don't wake up.

761
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:07,380
Okay, bye-

762
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:08,775
Bye.

763
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:29,260
They're always playing pranks
on Lucho, huh?

764
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:31,420
Yeah.

765
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:33,620
But he's the worst of them all.

766
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:37,700
One summer,
Juan got pictures of him

767
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:40,180
taking a dump in Fatso's bag.

768
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:42,260
He didn't care.

769
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:47,260
Fede got his cell phone
and started taking pictures.

770
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:54,300
And one year later,
Fede found the pics

771
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:57,140
and he wanted to kill him.

772
01:06:57,140 --> 01:07:00,100
They always pull pranks
like that, though.

773
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:06,380
Sometimes they cross the line.

774
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:09,100
Did you put some clothes
in the wash today too?

775
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:15,100
Yeah.

776
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:20,300
I don't have any
clean underwear left.

777
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:21,940
It doesn't matter.

778
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:24,691
I'll just go to bed like this.

779
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:45,620
I saw you reading "Demian."

780
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:46,860
You read a lot.

781
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:49,620
I do quite a lot
of reading myself,

782
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:51,780
but I think you beat me.

783
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:55,700
No, only when I'm on vacation.

784
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:58,100
During the year...

785
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:01,500
I don't have time
to read anything.

786
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:02,740
It's really hard.

787
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:04,700
You know what I started doing?

788
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:07,700
It's great. I go out
without a backpack

789
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:09,620
and with a book.

790
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:13,140
So since I don't have a backpack,
I carry them around in my hand.

791
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:15,860
When I'm on the subway,
the bus, or getting paperwork done,

792
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:18,900
I read them and that's how
I finish them quickly.

793
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:21,820
So anyway...

794
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:23,340
What about "Demian"?

795
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:25,100
Had you read it before?

796
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:27,540
Yeah...

797
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:32,500
but I started looking into it
and I found out

798
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,340
that it's Hesse's story.

799
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:38,860
It's his story.

800
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:41,460
Actually, you know what he did?

801
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:45,420
He published the book with the name
of the main character: Sinclair.

802
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:49,140
And then he said it was about him,

803
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:51,820
so they started
to publish it as "Hesse."

804
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:56,340
I had already read Steppenwolf
and...

805
01:08:56,340 --> 01:09:00,140
And...

806
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:03,380
the one about Buddha...

807
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:04,420
Siddhartha.

808
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:07,660
Siddhartha, yeah.

809
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:12,540
Besides, I read it
when I was fourteen.

810
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:14,620
A long time ago.

811
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:17,452
So I felt like reading it again.

812
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:41,580
When I...

813
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:44,100
When I read it,

814
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:53,660
I thought he was in love
with Demian.

815
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:56,163
Yeah, it's a bit like that.

816
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:29,180
I'm totally in love with her.

817
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:30,820
I want to marry her.

818
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:33,500
I don't really mind
her fits of jealousy.

819
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,380
I can handle it.

820
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:38,260
As long as I don't give her reasons
to be suspicious

821
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:41,300
and start imagining things,

822
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:44,340
I think she'll get over it.

823
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:47,780
- Yeah, I know you like her.
- Yeah, I love her!

824
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:51,260
But she keeps asking me
if there are women here,

825
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:54,260
if any girls
are going to come over.

826
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:56,820
She said she's going to
drop by unexpectedly.

827
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:58,100
- You don't know when.
- I don't know.

828
01:10:58,100 --> 01:10:59,260
She can come.
What's the problem?

829
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:01,500
I don't know...

830
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,140
But anyway...

831
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:04,620
She's not dumb.

832
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:06,340
She knows that there are going
to be women here sometimes,

833
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:08,420
friends of yours.

834
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:10,300
Yeah.

835
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:14,340
But I think that if I don't give her
any reason to be suspicious,

836
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:18,460
she'll start to relax.
I don't know.

837
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:20,580
But I totally understand her.

838
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:21,460
Why?

839
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:23,740
Because her ex boyfriend
cheated on her with her friend.

840
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:25,700
No!

841
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:27,460
- What a jerk!
- No wonder!

842
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:28,980
- Now she's traumatized.
- Of course.

843
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:30,980
She's paranoid that the person
she's with will cheat on her.

844
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:35,260
That's why she asks me all the time
and calls me.

845
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:38,380
- But the guy's an asshole.
- Yeah, he's an asshole.

846
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:39,780
And so is her friend.

847
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:42,260
Her too.

848
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:43,300
What a bitch!

849
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:45,380
- I think you shouldn't play along.
- Yeah.

850
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:46,540
Right.

851
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:49,900
I'd just want to have a girlfriend
so I don't get the blowfish anymore.

852
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:51,380
That's was a good one.

853
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:52,780
That's a good one.

854
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:58,860
What?

855
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:00,060
The blowfish!

856
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:04,740
You're terrible.
You love to cum inside, man.

857
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:07,340
I'm serious, man. Stop it.

858
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:09,660
One day someone's gonna
go to your house

859
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:11,940
late at night,
ring the doorbell

860
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:14,660
and say "Juan, this is your kid.

861
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:17,900
Kid, this is your dad.
You have to take care of him."

862
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:20,100
You'll want to kill yourself!

863
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:21,860
Knock on wood, man.
What are you talking about?

864
01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:26,300
I will, but you have to
take care of yourself.

865
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:27,860
He's right.

866
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:30,342
Yeah, man. Wear a condom.

867
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:47,740
I'm going to wake Fer up.

868
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:50,780
Alright, alright.
Do you want some coffee?

869
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:53,026
Yeah, okay. I'll be right down.

870
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:08,820
Fer...

871
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:13,380
<i>Hey.</i>

872
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:16,420
Fer...

873
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:20,380
Hey! Wake up.

874
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:24,380
Let's go buy some meat.
Come on!

875
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:26,580
Hey! Fer!

876
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:29,540
Come on, dude! Wake up!

877
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:31,860
Come on, you cocksucker!
Wake up! Come on!

878
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:34,220
Come on! I'm going to jump on you!
Come on!

879
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:35,380
Come on, cocksucker!

880
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:38,140
Come on! Hey! Fer!

881
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:39,460
Hey!

882
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:40,740
Okay, alright.

883
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:42,820
I'll be waiting for you downstairs.

884
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:44,922
Come on, cocksucker!

885
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:10,820
Ger, are you in there?

886
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:12,660
Yeah.

887
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:16,700
- Diego woke you up, right?
- Yes.

888
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:19,820
Okay, I'm going
to go shopping with him

889
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:21,620
and I'll see you later, okay?

890
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:23,116
<i>Okay.</i>

891
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:06,700
Hi.

892
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:07,740
Hi.

893
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:09,924
How are you?

894
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:16,519
How was your trip?

895
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:38,411
Hi. What are you doing here,
honey?

896
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:47,900
You look beautiful.
Did you come here by yourself?

897
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:50,500
No, I came with Carla.

898
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:52,580
With Carla?

899
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:54,420
You're not mad, are you?

900
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:59,340
I don't know, honey.
I'm really sleepy. Just let me sleep.

901
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:08,740
You're so beautiful.

902
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:10,980
Are you happy I came?

903
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:14,981
I'm really sleepy, honey.
Stop asking me that.

904
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:26,097
Pass it to me!

905
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:33,660
Under the bridge...

906
01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:34,740
It's great.

907
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:39,596
I can tell you what I think...

908
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:24,900
Hey, Fer...

909
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:27,220
What's up with Germán?

910
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:29,540
What do you mean "what's up"?

911
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:31,538
I don't know. You tell me.

912
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:46,338
I think you guys look like
you make a good karate duo.

913
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:09,700
We always look like the ones
who are desperate to have kids,

914
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:13,300
but that's because you guys can have
kids your whole lives and we can't.

915
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:16,420
For example, my cousin and my sister
are always making calculations.

916
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:18,740
YOU take one year to meet someone,

917
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:21,580
two years to get along well

918
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:23,380
and three years
to move in together.

919
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:26,140
But if things don't work,
you're back where you started,

920
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:28,620
and then you've wasted
three years of your life.

921
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:29,900
I don't know.

922
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:32,740
The reality is that you guys
can have kids

923
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:35,740
with the first woman you meet
at whatever age.

924
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:38,980
You can have a kid at 50
if you're with a young woman.

925
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:43,180
Tomas' face talking about kids.

926
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:46,060
No, I ask her about it
more than she says.

927
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:49,300
I say we should have them now
when we're young.

928
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:52,180
But she wants to go to school
and all that, right?

929
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:53,660
It's true.

930
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:59,460
If it were up to me,
I'd have kids right now.

931
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:01,158
NOW!

932
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:34,540
Last year, my boyfriend and I
went backpacking to the south,

933
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:36,340
to Rincón del Azul.
Do you know it?

934
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:38,900
- Yeah.
- It's great!

935
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:43,060
Because there are refuges
in that area where you can stay

936
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:45,540
for as many days as you want.

937
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:49,460
The water there is turquoise.
That place is amazing.

938
01:20:49,460 --> 01:20:51,740
You know where you really
have to go?

939
01:20:51,740 --> 01:20:54,500
To the North,
the whole Northern area...

940
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:57,060
Purmamarca, Humahuaca...

941
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:59,220
I have a bunch of contacts
at the hostels there.

942
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:01,220
If you want,
I'll give you my whatsapp number

943
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:04,540
-and send you all the information.
- Okay, yeah.

944
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:08,220
What I really want to see,
even though it's more expensive,

945
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:10,420
is Chile.
I'm dying to go there.

946
01:21:10,420 --> 01:21:12,780
I want to go to Pucón,
Villarica...

947
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:14,780
and then go down to Valdivia.

948
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:17,900
I went there when I was a kid,
with my parents.

949
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:19,740
But I don't remember anything.

950
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:21,900
I remember a fish market

951
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:23,980
and the sea lions
that were there, lying in the sun.

952
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:28,780
People would feed them.

953
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:31,660
Do you want me to give you
my whatsapp number now

954
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:33,100
so we don't forget?

955
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:34,506
- Okay.
- Yeah?

956
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:03,900
Hi!

957
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:07,060
What are you guys doing?

958
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:10,260
No, come over here.
We're having a blast!

959
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:13,260
Okay, go get Luli
and all of you come over.

960
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:14,700
The house is great.

961
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:19,780
Fer said we can all stay
in his mom's room.

962
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:25,460
Yeah... We're with Fede,
Diego, Maxi...

963
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:27,260
Yeah.

964
01:22:27,260 --> 01:22:32,940
They're the guys you met
at Centenario Park. Remember?

965
01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:36,580
They're not annoying at all.
I'm here with Carla...

966
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:38,260
and we're having the best time.

967
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:40,580
The best time.

968
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:45,180
Come on. It's a lot more fun.

969
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:47,980
Really, the house is huge
and they'll leave us

970
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:51,580
two or three bedrooms.

971
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:54,940
Stop it!

972
01:22:54,940 --> 01:22:58,380
<i>Okay.</i>

973
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:00,860
Alright.

974
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:01,620
Shut up!

975
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:04,860
Alright, bye.

976
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:06,180
Well? Well?

977
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:08,380
They're not coming.

978
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:11,620
I know them.
They're not gonna come.

979
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:14,260
Why did you have to whisper
all the time, Fatso?

980
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:16,140
I just said we have
a tennis court and a pool!

981
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:23,500
They heard you, Fatso!

982
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:24,820
TomÃ¡s...

983
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:28,980
I'm taking the toothbrush, okay?

984
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:30,988
Sleep well.

985
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:33,740
Do you want to go to sleep?

986
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:35,310
Okay, yeah.

987
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:55,420
Are you still in a relationship?

988
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:57,900
Yeah.

989
01:24:57,900 --> 01:25:01,460
- You too, right?
- Yeah.

990
01:25:01,460 --> 01:25:03,420
We're actually thinking
about moving in together.

991
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:05,700
Really?

992
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:09,540
So are we.

993
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:14,300
But we're just starting
to talk about it.

994
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:16,420
But it's a big step.

995
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:20,100
Yeah.

996
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:23,100
It's kind of like getting married.

997
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:26,540
- I don't know...
- But it's cool.

998
01:25:26,540 --> 01:25:29,740
I don't know if it's cool
to think about it like that.

999
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:32,097
But yeah, I don't know.

1000
01:25:41,060 --> 01:25:48,100
So are you faithful?

1001
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:50,200
As much as possible.

1002
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:15,740
I'm gonna wake him up.

1003
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:17,700
No, no, no! Don't do that.

1004
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:20,700
- Come on!
- No! He won't wake up.

1005
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:24,980
- Yeah!
- Okay, do whatever you want.

1006
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:33,900
They always take your bed.

1007
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:36,540
What do we do?

1008
01:26:36,540 --> 01:26:39,500
We can sleep in your bed.

1009
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,322
<i>Okay.</i>

1010
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:03,008
You sleep on the side of the wall,
okay?

1011
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:26,100
Should I turn off the lights?

1012
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:27,657
Yeah.

1013
01:27:54,220 --> 01:27:57,060
Fer...

1014
01:27:57,060 --> 01:28:00,620
- Hey, man...
- What's the matter?

1015
01:28:00,620 --> 01:28:02,980
Come with me to get some pastries.

1016
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:06,540
Lucho took my car to take
Guada's friend to the capital.

1017
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:08,140
Just go on foot.

1018
01:28:08,140 --> 01:28:10,300
Come on, man! Take me in your car.

1019
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:12,140
Just go on foot.
It's really nearby.

1020
01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:14,940
I'm not going to go on foot.
Come on, get up!

1021
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:20,420
I always go.
You guys are so lazy!

1022
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:22,949
I'll go with you.

1023
01:28:56,940 --> 01:28:58,060
What happened?

1024
01:28:58,060 --> 01:29:00,140
The chick's amazing!

1025
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:04,380
We were making out
next to the tennis court.

1026
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:09,460
At one point, she looks at the shed
and says "What's in there?"

1027
01:29:09,460 --> 01:29:10,780
And that was it.

1028
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:13,700
She pulled down my pants
and started sucking my cock...

1029
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:16,340
It was awesome!

1030
01:29:16,340 --> 01:29:19,380
Then I went to the bedroom
to get the condoms

1031
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:22,060
and this idiot
didn't want to give me any.

1032
01:29:22,060 --> 01:29:24,180
Nah...

1033
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:26,540
But I thought the girl
was really faithful,

1034
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:29,100
or at least
that's what Guada says.

1035
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:32,780
Maybe since both of them are
in a relationship, she didn't care.

1036
01:29:32,780 --> 01:29:35,060
But if Lucho hadn't told me
that he saw it,

1037
01:29:35,060 --> 01:29:36,780
I wouldn't have believed it.

1038
01:29:36,780 --> 01:29:39,260
Why were you spying on us,
you cocksucker?

1039
01:29:39,260 --> 01:29:41,540
If l had seen you, I would've
beaten the crap outta you.

1040
01:29:41,540 --> 01:29:42,780
I'm serious.

1041
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:44,540
That's not right.

1042
01:29:44,540 --> 01:29:47,180
You screwed the girl I'd been
flirting with all afternoon,

1043
01:29:47,180 --> 01:29:49,300
with my condoms...

1044
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:52,945
The least I could do
was watch her in action a little.

1045
01:29:55,580 --> 01:29:58,260
You always say Leo's a cocksucker,

1046
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:01,180
but you were watching her
suck on my cock.

1047
01:30:01,180 --> 01:30:03,500
Yeah... Yeah right, you cocksucker.

1048
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:07,100
You perverted voyeur.

1049
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:16,980
What's the matter with you?

1050
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:25,740
I'm pissing myself.

1051
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:27,974
Are you coming with me?

1052
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:15,460
Hey, Fer's a good fighter,
right?

1053
01:31:15,460 --> 01:31:18,060
We don't fight.

1054
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:21,780
We just train.

1055
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:27,620
But Fer's the best.
Everyone loves him.

1056
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:30,980
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

1057
01:31:30,980 --> 01:31:35,180
When we were kids
and we went out dancing,

1058
01:31:35,180 --> 01:31:37,620
a couple of times
we got into fights with people.

1059
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:40,940
But he was always there for us.

1060
01:31:40,940 --> 01:31:43,980
He'd always defend us...

1061
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:47,740
Anyone. He was always the first one
to defend anyone.

1062
01:31:47,740 --> 01:31:50,300
It's too bad...

1063
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:53,740
he's head over heels in love
with a friend of my girlfriend's.

1064
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:58,980
It's been ages,
but he's still in love with her.

1065
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:01,660
The four of us used to double date.

1066
01:32:01,660 --> 01:32:05,780
We went on vacation together once.

1067
01:32:05,780 --> 01:32:10,740
But since the girl left him,
he hasn't been with anyone else.

1068
01:32:10,740 --> 01:32:13,100
It's crazy.

1069
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:15,340
- Didn't he tell you?
- No.

1070
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:16,820
No, I didn't know.

1071
01:32:16,820 --> 01:32:18,940
Yeah, he's head-over-heels in love.

1072
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:21,540
He doesn't even talk
about the girl though, you know?

1073
01:32:21,540 --> 01:32:24,620
He didn't tell you,
but I know.

1074
01:32:24,620 --> 01:32:27,180
I've known Fer for a long time

1075
01:32:27,180 --> 01:32:29,460
and I know he's in love.

1076
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:31,540
Even though he doesn't mention her.

1077
01:32:31,540 --> 01:32:33,140
He's crazy about her.

1078
01:32:33,140 --> 01:32:36,780
If the girl wanted to get back
together with him,

1079
01:32:36,780 --> 01:32:39,220
he wouldn't think twice.

1080
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:41,088
I'm sure he wouldn't.

1081
01:33:22,580 --> 01:33:25,060
Hey, your friend,
the one with the weed, is here.

1082
01:33:25,060 --> 01:33:26,940
- Seba?
- Yeah.

1083
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:32,860
He looks like a real bum.

1084
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:37,540
- Did he tell you anything?
- No.

1085
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:38,820
Thanks, Seba.

1086
01:33:38,820 --> 01:33:41,300
Awesome.

1087
01:33:41,300 --> 01:33:43,180
I came in, he opened the door...

1088
01:33:43,180 --> 01:33:44,220
And when I saw all those
straight guys in the pool,

1089
01:33:44,220 --> 01:33:45,700
I almost died.

1090
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:48,620
One of them, the big blond guy,
was in his underwear.

1091
01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:52,540
He took it off
and put on his bathing suit.

1092
01:33:52,540 --> 01:33:53,620
I went crazy.

1093
01:33:53,620 --> 01:33:55,580
They said "Get in the pool."

1094
01:33:55,580 --> 01:33:59,340
I thought if I got in the pool,
I'd turn into a mermaid

1095
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:02,620
and I'd be exposed.

1096
01:34:02,620 --> 01:34:06,860
I'm dying to have sex
with all of them.

1097
01:34:06,860 --> 01:34:09,300
So what's up with that guy?
Fernando, right?

1098
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:11,060
Yeah.

1099
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:13,220
I don't know what's up with him.

1100
01:34:13,220 --> 01:34:15,380
I'm kind of confused.

1101
01:34:15,380 --> 01:34:18,100
I don't get it.
We're together all the time

1102
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:20,540
and he keeps looking at me.

1103
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:24,980
He laughs a lot.

1104
01:34:24,980 --> 01:34:28,580
Last night we slept together
and in the middle of the night,

1105
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:33,740
I felt his hard cock
against my leg.

1106
01:34:33,740 --> 01:34:36,940
But I don't know,
because we were sleeping.

1107
01:34:36,940 --> 01:34:41,340
You're slow. I would've gone down
to drink from the hose.

1108
01:34:41,340 --> 01:34:46,580
No, no, no. I don't know.

1109
01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:50,620
I was just talking to Leo,
the guy we came with,

1110
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:56,260
and he confused me even more.

1111
01:34:56,260 --> 01:34:58,260
That Leo guy stares a lot.

1112
01:34:58,260 --> 01:34:59,820
I think he's gay.

1113
01:34:59,820 --> 01:35:01,580
I don't know.
That's the impression I got.

1114
01:35:01,580 --> 01:35:03,705
I think he's gay too.

1115
01:35:28,940 --> 01:35:31,085
You suck, Fatso!

1116
01:35:35,780 --> 01:35:38,700
There's the fucking ball,
you idiot!

1117
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:41,140
- Take it easy!
- He said I suck!

1118
01:35:41,140 --> 01:35:44,463
Relax, Diego!

1119
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:47,940
Who do you think you are?
Messi?

1120
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:55,220
Milky butt.

1121
01:35:55,220 --> 01:35:59,100
Here you go, Meat-head.

1122
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:01,420
There you go, you idiot!

1123
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:03,780
He's been cheating all day!

1124
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:06,780
And you guys don't say anything.
You play dumb too.

1125
01:36:06,780 --> 01:36:07,940
Shut up, man!

1126
01:36:07,940 --> 01:36:10,100
Don't tell me to shut up!

1127
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:11,860
Forget it.

1128
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:21,260
Hi!

1129
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:23,340
- How are you, Piojo?
- What's up?

1130
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:30,540
Everything's fine.

1131
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:33,420
How are you guys doing?

1132
01:36:33,420 --> 01:36:37,740
The cops took our bags
like they were going to check them.

1133
01:36:37,740 --> 01:36:44,380
I wasn't worried, because
I didn't have anything at the time.

1134
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:47,700
But at one point, someone
started talking louder

1135
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:50,420
in another language.
That made us more nervous

1136
01:36:50,420 --> 01:36:53,940
because we couldn't understand
what they were saying.

1137
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:59,500
I turn around and I see
a huge blonde woman

1138
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:01,940
with my jean jacket in her hand...

1139
01:37:01,940 --> 01:37:04,740
She was holding it
as if it were dirty.

1140
01:37:04,740 --> 01:37:08,580
And in the other hand,
she was wearing a blue glove

1141
01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:11,180
and holding some shrooms,
like evidence.

1142
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:14,940
When I saw that I realized
that l had something...

1143
01:37:14,940 --> 01:37:17,900
But when I saw the jacket,

1144
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:21,540
I realized that I had had
that jacket for five years

1145
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:22,980
and I hadn't washed it,

1146
01:37:22,980 --> 01:37:24,540
so those shrooms had been in there
for a long time.

1147
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:27,100
They were all old and dry,

1148
01:37:27,100 --> 01:37:28,700
so they weren't effective anymore.

1149
01:37:28,700 --> 01:37:30,620
They analyzed them

1150
01:37:30,620 --> 01:37:33,180
and realized there was no problem.

1151
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:36,180
They had us there for a while...

1152
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:40,220
In the end we even laughed
about it together

1153
01:37:40,220 --> 01:37:43,180
and that was it.
They let us go.

1154
01:37:43,180 --> 01:37:46,660
So luckily I'm here
and I can tell about it.

1155
01:37:46,660 --> 01:37:48,300
I'm free.

1156
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:51,860
So I brought you
a couple of...

1157
01:37:51,860 --> 01:37:55,580
a couple of interesting things
for you to have fun tonight.

1158
01:37:55,580 --> 01:37:57,260
So enjoy it.

1159
01:37:57,260 --> 01:38:00,210
We can get in the pool later,
if you want.

1160
01:39:33,140 --> 01:39:35,580
Do you want to go to the pool?

1161
01:39:35,580 --> 01:39:37,738
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1162
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:21,625
- Is my eye red?
- Let me see.

1163
01:40:31,220 --> 01:40:34,260
Lucho...

1164
01:40:34,260 --> 01:40:35,980
- Did you guys get some rest?
- Yeah.

1165
01:40:35,980 --> 01:40:37,420
The guys already left.

1166
01:40:37,420 --> 01:40:40,220
They didn't want to wake you up.

1167
01:40:40,220 --> 01:40:43,100
Leo got up early
and started getting on our nerves.

1168
01:40:43,100 --> 01:40:45,300
He took everyone, Maxi, Fede...

1169
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:48,220
We're going to go back
in a van later.

1170
01:40:48,220 --> 01:40:50,780
You have to leave the car
to your Mom, right?

1171
01:40:50,780 --> 01:40:54,220
Yeah, because she needs it.

1172
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:57,100
We'll help you clean up later.

1173
01:40:57,100 --> 01:40:59,700
Are you staying till tomorrow?

1174
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:00,660
Yeah.

1175
01:41:00,660 --> 01:41:05,660
I'll clean up with him.

1176
01:41:05,660 --> 01:41:07,700
We'll be back in a while.

1177
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:09,324
See ya.

1178
01:41:23,340 --> 01:41:27,220
- Do you wanna go?
- Let's go.

1179
01:42:15,980 --> 01:42:17,380
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1180
01:42:17,380 --> 01:42:20,149
One, two, three.

1181
01:43:15,540 --> 01:43:18,420
Did you have a good time?

1182
01:43:18,420 --> 01:43:20,838
Yeah... I had a great time.

1183
01:45:40,820 --> 01:45:43,574
Can I kiss you?
