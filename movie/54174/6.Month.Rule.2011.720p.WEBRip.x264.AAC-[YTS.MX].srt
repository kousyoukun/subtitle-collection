I mean, we fight all the time.

54
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,090
standing here in the photography section

55
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,560
of this bookstore talking to you,

56
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,940
is that that's my book.

57
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,990
And you're looking at my book,

58
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,693
and I thought that was cool.

59
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,540
- This is your book?

60
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,373
- Yes.

61
00:04:24,373 --> 00:04:26,110
- You're Tyler Watts.

62
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,773
- I am Tyler Watts, yes.

63
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,160
- Nice picture.

64
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,750
- Thank you.

65
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,650
- Hmm, so is this like a thing you do,

66
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,050
you come here and wait for
girls to pick up your book?

67
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,690
- Oh no, I don't come
here to pick up girls.

68
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,343
I come here, wait, this
is embarrassing too.

69
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,290
I'm okay with it.

70
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,400
I come here to see if
anybody bought my book.

71
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,540
There are seven, see,

72
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,060
and if they're less than seven,

73
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,450
then somebody's bought one.

74
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,290
- Are there ever?

75
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,580
- Ever what?

76
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,070
- Less than seven?

77
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,440
- There used to be eight.

78
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,640
Somebody bought one on January 10th, 2007.

79
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,627
- Oh, that was a long time ago.

80
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,413
- I peaked early.

81
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,610
- Do you still shoot?

82
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,580
- You know, Hut Hut Hamburger,
the chain restaurant?

83
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,863
The little pictures of food on the menu?

84
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,780
That was me.

85
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,613
It's pathetic.

86
00:05:15,613 --> 00:05:16,650
- Are you drunk?

87
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,483
- No.

88
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,870
Yes, slightly.

89
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,970
- This a regular drunken activity for you?

90
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,020
- I'm gonna be honest with you.

91
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,070
It's happened before.

92
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,797
- Uh oh.
- What?

93
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:31,630
- Five-O.

94
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,160
- Five, oh.

95
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,823
- Hey man, did you put
these books over there?

96
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,270
- No.
- Yeah, you did.

97
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,100
You put these books in
the clearance section.

98
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,292
Why would you do that?

99
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:45,230
'Cause it's fucking weird.

100
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:49,533
Do you not like books
about spoons or something?

101
00:05:50,568 --> 00:05:52,680
- It's just a bunch of pictures of spoons.

102
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,990
- Yeah.

103
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,863
- No, no, I don't like it.

104
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,593
- Fucking weird.

105
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:16,880
- Having a late night?

106
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,800
- It's early yet.

107
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,510
- Have you been drinking?

108
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,343
- Hardly at all.

109
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,780
- You look like you've been
having a bookstore night.

110
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,160
- You don't tell people
about that, do you?

111
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,720
- Oh, my sensitive little artist.

112
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,110
- Yeah.

113
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,110
Seriously, don't tell people about that.

114
00:06:34,234 --> 00:06:36,401
(moaning)

115
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,133
- You leaving?

116
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,150
- You know the rules.

117
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,180
- Oh right, the rules.

118
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,773
How silly of me, I forgot.

119
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,840
So when did you break up with the ad exec?

120
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,100
- Last night.

121
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,070
- Wow, well you're consistent at least.

122
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,600
- Where is my shirt?

123
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,100
- Living room.
- Living room.

124
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,223
- So how long was this one?

125
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,453
- Four months-ish.

126
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,533
- Hi.

127
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:29,366
- Yeah.

128
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,120
- You know we've been doing
this for two years now?

129
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,480
- That is absolutely my
longest relationship.

130
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,313
- Me too.

131
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,993
God, me too.

132
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,640
Do you think that's weird?

133
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,473
- What?

134
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:44,750
- That the longest
relationship either one of us

135
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,043
has ever had is a totally uncommitted one?

136
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,170
- You've been reading self-help
books again, I can tell.

137
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,570
- This ad exec.

138
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,210
I mean, what was wrong with her, really?

139
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,280
- She was corny, I didn't like it.

140
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,100
And she laughed way too loud.

141
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,173
- That's a huge rationalization.

142
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,640
- I didn't think she'd take it so bad.

143
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,623
- Well, she was in love with you.

144
00:08:15,226 --> 00:08:17,060
(phone ringing)

145
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,260
- [Tyler] Hey Alan.

146
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,293
- [Alan] Hey, Ty.

147
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,130
- [Tyler] What's up man?

148
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,900
- Can you, look, I really need

149
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,450
to talk to you about something.

150
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,180
- This is the best
thing that could happen.

151
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,013
- I disagree.

152
00:08:29,013 --> 00:08:29,846
- No, I'm serious.

153
00:08:29,846 --> 00:08:30,800
She's out of your life.

154
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,350
You are back on the market.

155
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,350
- This is a disaster, Ty.

156
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,480
- You are about to upgrade, my friend.

157
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,910
- I really don't think you understand

158
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,313
the depth of my heartache.

159
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,780
- I understand, and I
feel bad, I really do,

160
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,940
but I wish you would snap out of this.

161
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,670
Look, girls come and go.

162
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,160
That's just how it works.

163
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,570
Friendship, that's the only lasting thing.

164
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,403
It's a rule.

165
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,939
- A rule?

166
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:55,873
That's what need.

167
00:08:55,873 --> 00:08:57,330
I really loved her.

168
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,420
- Well, you know who else you loved.

169
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,040
Elizabeth?

170
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,610
Who was the redhead?

171
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,103
- Harriet.
- Harriet.

172
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,053
And where are they?

173
00:09:08,053 --> 00:09:08,930
- I don't know.

174
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,230
- And who's standing here next to you?

175
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,750
- You are.
- I am.

176
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,690
That's right.

177
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,930
Friendship, it's the important thing.

178
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,860
Not some bitch who walked all over you

179
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,440
and then kicked you to the curb.

180
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,613
- She didn't walk all over
me and kick me to the curb.

181
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,200
Don't call her a bitch either.

182
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,333
- Hey Kenny.

183
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,260
- Yeah.

184
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,040
- One word you would
use to describe Claire.

185
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,140
- Who's Claire?

186
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,610
- Alan's ex.

187
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,940
- Oh, the chick who used to
order the mojitos all the time?

188
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,900
- Yep.

189
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,440
- Bitch.

190
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,320
- Thank you.

191
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,810
- Great, no, thank you.

192
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,363
- Hey, let me ask you a stupid question.

193
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,423
You got the ring back, right?

194
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,953
- Don't do this.

195
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:58,030
- Alan Alan Alan.
- Don't do this.

196
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,370
- Look me and the eye

197
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,237
and tell me you got that
engagement ring back, man.

198
00:10:02,237 --> 00:10:03,700
- That was a gift.

199
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,793
- Oh my God.

200
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,550
You have clearly lost your mind.

201
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,873
- Boys, this one's on me.

202
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,953
- Need that.

203
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,030
- Alan, here's to getting
rid of the mojito bitch.

204
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,583
You guys have any idea

205
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,430
how long it takes me to
make a fucking mojito?

206
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,900
- Jesus, will you give her a break?

207
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,110
She has a sophisticated palate.

208
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,110
- Where you staying?

209
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,260
- Staying on the couch.

210
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,490
- Whose couch, her couch?

211
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,110
No, no, no, no.

212
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,277
- Yeah, I'm staying on
our couch, big deal.

213
00:10:37,277 --> 00:10:39,130
- You can stay on my couch.

214
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,730
- Why would I do that?

215
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,610
- You'd rather stay with the
girl who broke your heart

216
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,940
and desperately wants you out of her life.

217
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,170
- God, have a heart.

218
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,820
- Listen to me, I'm
gonna tell you the truth,

219
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,750
and it's gonna hurt.

220
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,230
She did not break up with you

221
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,760
because she's going through a tough time,

222
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,420
or whatever other bullshit she told you.

223
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,420
- Yeah, yeah, she really does.

224
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,320
She just needs some time to

225
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,210
clear her head.

226
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,240
- Clear her head.

227
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,510
There are two reasons
why someone breaks up

228
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,770
with their significant other.

229
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,770
Okay, the first and most common,

230
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,250
they really want to fuck somebody else.

231
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,083
- Jesus.

232
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,670
- The second is they've
developed so much disdain

233
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,580
for their significant other,

234
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,930
that they can't stand to
look at their face anymore.

235
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,260
Actually the second one
usually manifests itself

236
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,550
because they secretly want
to fuck somebody else.

237
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,230
So in reality, I guess
there's only one reason.

238
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,830
- You really could have
not said any of that

239
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,023
and I'd be better off.

240
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,420
- Look, she's gonna hate
you, or she's gonna pity you.

241
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,150
If you stay in that house
with her, it will be both.

242
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,147
- Oh God, okay.

243
00:11:33,147 --> 00:11:34,230
All right, man.

244
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,300
I'll pack up my stuff

245
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,310
and I'll come over tomorrow after work.

246
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,260
- It's a good call.

247
00:11:43,722 --> 00:11:44,555
You okay?

248
00:11:44,555 --> 00:11:46,010
- I think I'm gonna puke.

249
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,472
- Okay.

250
00:11:47,472 --> 00:11:50,222
(phone ringing)

251
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,443
- What?

252
00:11:53,443 --> 00:11:55,330
- Hey, where the hell have you
been, I've been calling you.

253
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,330
- Yeah, I've been ignoring
you, what do you want?

254
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,299
- Are you with a girl? You're
with a girl, aren't you?

255
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:01,420
Oh baby, 2:15 in the afternoon.

256
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,610
She's a blonde, isn't she?

257
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,830
- You are really wrecking
my afternoon here.

258
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,773
- All right look, have you ever heard

259
00:12:05,773 --> 00:12:08,760
of a little periodical
called The Underground?

260
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,910
- Yeah, it's the weekly rag, right?

261
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,790
- Ouch, I'm sorry,

262
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,310
your ignorance has just
hurt my ear a little bit.

263
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,380
The Underground my friend,
it's hip, it's hot,

264
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,100
it's edgy, it makes careers.

265
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,120
- What do you want me to do,
get a subscription or what?

266
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,900
- No, I want you to do a spread for it.

267
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,300
- With what food group will I be dealing?

268
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,550
- Nope, no food groups.

269
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,310
A person, a rockstar.

270
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,690
Well, an up and coming rockstar.

271
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,790
- Wait, what are you talking about?

272
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,820
- Julian Bowers, singer-songwriter.

273
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,653
- I don't know him.

274
00:12:35,653 --> 00:12:36,760
- Well, he knows you.

275
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,490
His label's publicist just called.

276
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,760
He loves your work,

277
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,070
he wants you to do the photo
shoot in The Underground.

278
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,970
He says you and he had the same voice.

279
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:44,850
- Do you think he saw in my book?

280
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,060
I bet he saw my book, huh?

281
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,770
- Well, either that or
he really liked that shot

282
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,020
of the chicken pieces you did.

283
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,470
His label is calling to set up
a meeting sometime this week,

284
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,170
and I'm gonna email you his songs,

285
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,250
and I want you to listen
to them Tyler, okay?

286
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,630
Don't fuck this up.

287
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,890
- You did good, Paulie.

288
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:58,910
- That's what I wanted to hear.

289
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:02,060
Hey, Tyler, bang that blonde once for me.

290
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:02,963
- I sure will.

291
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,420
- Good news?

292
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,253
- Yeah.

293
00:13:09,732 --> 00:13:12,131
(pop music)

294
00:13:12,131 --> 00:13:14,964
(lyrics muffled)

295
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,990
- Groovy bookstore guy.

296
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,560
- Innocent bystander.

297
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,690
- You know, they kicked
me out of the bookstore

298
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,947
after you left, because they
thought we were in cahoots.

299
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:43,117
- Oh no.
- Oh yeah.

300
00:13:43,117 --> 00:13:45,032
- I'm really sorry about that.

301
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,118
- That's okay, it's kind of awesome.

302
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:47,460
I've been kicked out of anywhere before.

303
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,660
It gives me street cred.

304
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,660
- It does actually.

305
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,610
It wasn't my best moment.

306
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,560
- Actually, it was kind of endearing.

307
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,020
- You think, really?

308
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,130
- Oh no, not as much as
it was pathetic, but.

309
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,050
- Right, right, sure.

310
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,670
Ouch.

311
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,000
- What are you listening to?

312
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,190
- Oh, some poppy,
hipster, wannabe rockstar.

313
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,290
I'm shooting him for The Underground.

314
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:13,290
- Right, right, you're a photo boy.

315
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:16,250
You got some girly drink on
your coat there photo boy.

316
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,253
- Oh well, that's embarrassing.

317
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,800
Girly drink?

318
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,860
Are you disparaging the
iced blended coffee,

319
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,640
the thinking man's Icee?

320
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,010
- Disparaging it I am.

321
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,060
No tough guy would drink an
Icee, it's just an emasculating.

322
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,120
- Good tip.
- No problem.

323
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,953
See you around.

324
00:14:35,469 --> 00:14:39,386
(acoustic instrumental music)

325
00:14:48,033 --> 00:14:49,230
- So what do tough guys drink?

326
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,790
- In the coffee realm?

327
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,700
Well, you got a couple options.

328
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,900
You can drink an espresso,

329
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,040
or black coffee, and maybe
a latte on sensitive days,

330
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,340
but no foam, because no tough guy

331
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,694
would be caught dead
drinking anything foamy.

332
00:15:00,694 --> 00:15:02,050
- Who are you?

333
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,100
- Piqued your interest, huh?

334
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,890
- I am smitten, yeah.

335
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:08,530
Oh I don't go out with guys
who use the word, smitten.

336
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,520
- Or drink Icee, girly
coffee drinks, apparently.

337
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,160
- Well, a girl's gotta
have standards, huh?

338
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,620
- You drive a little motorcycle.

339
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,983
- No, I borrowed a little
motorcycle from a friend.

340
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,913
- Oh like a, man friend,
or just a friend, friend?

341
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,210
- It's weird that I saw you.

342
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,340
- Is it?

343
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,173
- Yeah, you and me,

344
00:15:28,173 --> 00:15:30,230
we got like a spooky
synchronicity going on.

345
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,063
- Spooky synchro?

346
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,580
I don't know what that means.

347
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,620
- See ya photo boy.

348
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,860
- Wait, can I call you or something?

349
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,039
- You didn't even know my name?

350
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,943
- This is true, we can remedy that.

351
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:48,056
Okay, she looks back, she likes me.

352
00:15:49,975 --> 00:15:53,475
(soft instrumental music)

353
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:07,550
(phone ringing)

354
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,383
- Hi.

355
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,970
- Hi.

356
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,300
May I help you?

357
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,713
- Yes, I am looking for Alan Norris.

358
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,390
- Do you have an appointment?

359
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,003
- No, I'm kinda surprising him.

360
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,460
- He's actually in a-

361
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,883
- Wow, you are like, crazy cute.

362
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,420
- Thank you.

363
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,740
- Sorry, I'm Tyler.

364
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,760
- Savannah.

365
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,710
- Nice to meet you.

366
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,463
- Hey Al!

367
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,390
That's my friend.

368
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,120
Hey.

369
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,839
- What are you doing here, man?

370
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:41,050
- Man, I met this girl
today who was amazing.

371
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,710
She's, she's smart and

372
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,040
like savvy and like talked really fast.

373
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,873
She was really awesome.

374
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:49,650
- Are you talking about the
secretary here in the office?

375
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,550
- Oh no, but she's nice too.

376
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,383
No, I'm talking about this

377
00:16:52,383 --> 00:16:54,480
mysterious Bohemian girl I met at this-

378
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,860
- Okay, Ty.

379
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,990
- Yeah.
- I get paid to work here.

380
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,770
What are you doing here?

381
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,210
- Oh, I thought we were going

382
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,760
to get the stuff from the bitch?

383
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,760
- Don't call her a bitch.

384
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,590
Look, I get off work at six, okay?

385
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,423
Come back then.

386
00:17:06,423 --> 00:17:07,890
- But I'm bored.

387
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,790
- You're a child.

388
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,330
I have things to do.

389
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,996
- Okay, that's cool. I'll
just hang out with Savannah

390
00:17:12,996 --> 00:17:13,829
until you're done with work.

391
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:15,483
- No no, I'll make up
a personal emergency.

392
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,470
Wait out here please.

393
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,620
- I'll wait right here.

394
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:20,783
Hurry.

395
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,880
I'll be right here, Alan.

396
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,940
- Yeah.

397
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,633
- Hi, I'm just waiting.

398
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:38,883
You ready?

399
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:41,803
- Yeah.

400
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,220
- You don't look ready.

401
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,053
- Maybe I'm not.

402
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,870
- Listen to me.

403
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,730
There is no woman in the world so perfect

404
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,890
that you cannot get
over her in six months.

405
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,450
- Six months?

406
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,740
That's an eternity, Tyler.

407
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,660
- Six months, tops.

408
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,650
Look, we are resilient, we bounce back.

409
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,310
Okay, why do you think I had this string

410
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,370
of short-term flings?

411
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,270
- 'Cause you're commitment-phobic.

412
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,570
- Because why would I sign
up for a relationship,

413
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,640
and all the sacrifices that come with it,

414
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,750
if I know that in six months

415
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,970
I could be completely
over the whole thing?

416
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,530
What I'm saying to you is this,

417
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:18,090
in six months, you'll be fine.

418
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,890
You'll be completely over her.

419
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,293
You will hate her, and you will be fine.

420
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,330
- You think you should
really be here with me?

421
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,163
- Yeah.

422
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,620
- You don't think this
is a little awkward, Ty?

423
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,453
- No.

424
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,600
- Hi.

425
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
- Hi.

426
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,433
- Hi.

427
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,743
- Alan, what is he doing here?

428
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,140
- I don't know.

429
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,360
- I just thought Alan might need some help

430
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,283
moving his things.

431
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,510
- I need to grab a few things, Claire.

432
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,070
- Yeah, you know, just what
he bought with his money,

433
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,950
or what you bought with his money.

434
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,120
Wait, that's everything, isn't it?

435
00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,953
- Stop it.

436
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:03,191
I just need to grab some clothes, Claire.

437
00:19:03,191 --> 00:19:04,220
Okay?

438
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,053
- For now.

439
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,733
- Asshole.
- Slut.

440
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,230
- [Alan] Hey Ty, can you
give me a hand in here?

441
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,427
- No, I'm good.

442
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,760
- Really, should go help him.

443
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,540
- I'd like to spend a
little time with you.

444
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,850
- Oh I'm so pleased.

445
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:20,960
- Where's the ring?

446
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,793
- What?

447
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:23,680
- The ring, where is it?

448
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,640
- My ring?
- His ring.

449
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,473
- I can't even believe

450
00:19:26,473 --> 00:19:27,940
I'm having this conversation with you.

451
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,150
- Do you have any idea how much
money he spent on that ring?

452
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,450
- What are you doing here?

453
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,770
Seriously, why are you here?

454
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,900
This has absolutely nothing
to do with you, Tyler.

455
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,320
Why don't you go take a
picture of a hamburger

456
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,920
and hit on an 18-year-old?

457
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,730
- Oh, are you mocking what I do?

458
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,233
- Only because it's stupid.

459
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,710
- For your information,

460
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,170
I got a really big photo shoot next week

461
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,487
for The Underground.

462
00:19:46,487 --> 00:19:48,960
- Oh, that's awesome.

463
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,730
I'll bet anybody else could
parlay that into a real career.

464
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,030
- Hey Ty, can I talk
to you for one second?

465
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:59,590
- Wow, you are really horrible.

466
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,340
- Well, at least I'm not a sellout.

467
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,163
- Jesus Christ.

468
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:11,173
That is the meanest bitch
I've ever met in my life,

469
00:20:11,173 --> 00:20:12,290
I am serious.

470
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,537
- What is that?

471
00:20:13,537 --> 00:20:14,370
- What?

472
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,203
- That.

473
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,973
What the fuck is that?

474
00:20:36,674 --> 00:20:37,790
Fuck.

475
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:38,623
- Overkill.

476
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,230
- What?

477
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,500
- An eight by 10?

478
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,333
Give me a break.

479
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,330
I mean, that's not even subtle.

480
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,930
I mean, at least have some
style about it, you know?

481
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,810
I mean, obviously she's
trying to make you jealous

482
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,970
with this guy, who is only
moderately good looking,

483
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,590
and almost assuredly not funny,

484
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,610
but have some style about it.

485
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,503
- Stop talking.

486
00:20:57,135 --> 00:20:57,968
- Yeah.

487
00:20:57,968 --> 00:21:00,635
(car starting)

488
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,900
- Hey, thanks again, man.

489
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,620
- No problem, this is
the way it should be.

490
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,780
You're on the couch.

491
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,613
- Yeah.

492
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,590
How do you afford this place and the loft?

493
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,420
- This is what you get
when you sell your soul.

494
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,070
It's actually a pretty good deal.

495
00:21:21,021 --> 00:21:22,973
- [Woman On Message] Hi, it's Becca.

496
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,740
Where are you?

497
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,573
Give me a call.

498
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:29,840
- You gonna tell me who that was?

499
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,143
- That was Becca.

500
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,503
- Great, that's a lot of information.

501
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,660
Why don't you call her back?

502
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,530
Are you avoiding her?

503
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,570
- No, I'm not avoiding
her, I'm fading her.

504
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,390
- You're gonna have to
tell me what that means.

505
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,590
- I saw Becca day before yesterday.

506
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,530
I haven't called her yet.

507
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,363
I'll call her tomorrow,

508
00:21:48,363 --> 00:21:50,350
when she's starting to get angry with me.

509
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,570
We'll have a great conversation.

510
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:54,250
She will feel silly for
getting angry with me,

511
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,580
and we'll make a date for next week.

512
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,620
We'll go out next week

513
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,300
and I'll talk about how
busy work is getting,

514
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,920
and then I won't call her for two weeks.

515
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,300
We continue this process,

516
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,820
gradually spreading out the time

517
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,930
between when we see each other,

518
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,140
until one day she looks up and she says,

519
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,883
hey, whatever happened to Tyler?

520
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,110
Thanks.

521
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,817
- That sounds like the
worst thing I've ever heard.

522
00:22:13,817 --> 00:22:14,650
- I doubt that.

523
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:18,460
- Why don't you just tell her the truth?

524
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,450
That you don't want to
hang out with her anymore.

525
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:22,583
Your way seems kind of cowardly.

526
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,560
- Cowardly?
- Yeah.

527
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,710
- Do you have any idea what it takes

528
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,420
to not talk to a girl for two weeks?

529
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,860
Call her up, go on a date,

530
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,820
avoid the confrontation and hookup?

531
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,290
It's not cowardly, my friend,

532
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,293
it's goddamn heroic.

533
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,870
- You and me, we're just different people.

534
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,640
- Look, I've seen this
girl two, three times.

535
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,510
You think that I'm required
to call and break up with her?

536
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,343
- Yeah.

537
00:22:44,343 --> 00:22:45,780
- I don't even know this person.

538
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,660
- But you slept with her.

539
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,220
- She'll tell me to go to hell,

540
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,480
and rightfully so.

541
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,030
You don't owe an explanation to someone

542
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,760
until you're in a committed relationship.

543
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,670
That's a rule.

544
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,310
- For a guy whose longest relationship

545
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,770
was less than a year
when he was a teenager,

546
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:01,900
you really seem to think
you have it figured out.

547
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,990
- I do have it figured out,

548
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,930
and that's exactly why
my longest relationship

549
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:05,980
was less than a year.

550
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,840
(phone ringing)

551
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,150
- Hey, Paulie.

552
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:22,983
- Where are you?

553
00:23:22,983 --> 00:23:23,850
- Coffee shop.

554
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,506
Hey, let me ask you a question.

555
00:23:25,506 --> 00:23:27,090
Do you think that iced
blended coffee drinks

556
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,550
are emasculating?

557
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,133
- No, not if you're a
big fag, which you are.

558
00:23:30,133 --> 00:23:31,850
Listen, I got a call from Julian

559
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,770
and he wants to meet with
you about that shoot.

560
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:34,603
- When?

561
00:23:34,603 --> 00:23:36,060
- Now, today.

562
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,130
- And of course, as my agent, you told him

563
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:41,050
I don't drop everything I'm
doing whenever he asks, right?

564
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,010
- Apparently he wants to meet you

565
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,120
at his favorite art gallery,

566
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,810
to quote, soak up the
artistic mystique, end quote.

567
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:47,690
- Come on.

568
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,330
- That big, weird place on Fifth.

569
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,650
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

570
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:53,420
That is like way out of my
three mile radius, Paul.

571
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,580
- Ty, no shit, come on.

572
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,560
This is really important.

573
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,020
This is a really big
thing for your career.

574
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,070
Go to the art gallery, don't mess around.

575
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,420
- [Woman] Okay, up on the left.

576
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,730
- [Man] You just said up on the right?

577
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,980
- [Woman] It's an
imperfect science, Charles.

578
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,080
- We're raising it a
quarter inch on the right,

579
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,150
a quarter inch on the left.

580
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,730
- It needs to go higher.

581
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:14,563
- [Man] That's as high as you can go

582
00:24:14,563 --> 00:24:16,020
without me going up into the rafters.

583
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,040
- No, it's not.

584
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,970
- It is, I'd have to go up and re-rig it.

585
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:21,473
- So I think it looks perfect.

586
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,990
- Hey.

587
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,110
- Spooky synchronicity, huh?

588
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:25,943
- Yeah.

589
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:30,970
- Is that yours?

590
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,450
- Yup.

591
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,283
- I like it.

592
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,553
- Thanks.

593
00:24:35,553 --> 00:24:37,350
- Well Sophie, if you're
done with the day labor here

594
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,530
I really needed to get back

595
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,930
to my spot on the corner
outside Home Depot.

596
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:41,763
- Yeah, I'm done, thanks.

597
00:24:41,763 --> 00:24:42,750
See you later.

598
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:43,583
- All right.

599
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,990
- Sophie's a good name.

600
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,173
- What are you doing here?

601
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,330
- You know, I knew that you

602
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:59,900
would have some cool job like, artist.

603
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,290
I thought it might be secret agent though.

604
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,330
You know, maybe a cat burglar.

605
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:06,293
You have a definite cat
burglar kind of vibe about you.

606
00:25:08,452 --> 00:25:09,589
Do you have any idea how much coffee

607
00:25:09,589 --> 00:25:11,070
I've had at that coffee shop

608
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,540
just waiting for you to come back?

609
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,790
The barista knows my
name, it's embarrassing.

610
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,500
I'm like a regular there, now.

611
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,882
- Yeah, you were waiting for me?

612
00:25:17,882 --> 00:25:18,715
- Yeah.

613
00:25:18,715 --> 00:25:22,493
- Well, I'm touched, and
only slightly freaked.

614
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:28,803
I should-

615
00:25:28,803 --> 00:25:31,060
- You know, I went back to
the bookstore the other night

616
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,250
and funny, there were only six books left.

617
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,090
- You went back?

618
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,090
- Well, yeah, I'm fearless.

619
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,080
Oh yeah.

620
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,380
- Wait a minute, is this
creepy bookstore guy?

621
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,310
- Yes, it is.

622
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,640
- Oh, awesome, a nickname,

623
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,650
with the word creepy in it.

624
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:45,993
Yeah that's nice.

625
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,170
- Charles, could you excuse
us for a moment please?

626
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:50,970
- Yeah, I guess I'm not
really needed here, am I?

627
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:52,370
- No.
- No.

628
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:54,120
No I guess I should just, I just,

629
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,670
see I own the gallery

630
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:58,090
but that makes me disposable apparently.

631
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:58,923
Yeah, tell you what,

632
00:25:58,923 --> 00:26:01,969
I'll just fade away, I guess,
just disappear, you know?

633
00:26:01,969 --> 00:26:03,410
You know what, maybe I
could go and hang myself,

634
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,820
that way I won't use up any
floor space in case you need it.

635
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,653
- Okay, great.

636
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,013
- See ya.
- See ya.

637
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,790
- You've been talking about me.

638
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,010
- Apparently.

639
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,603
- Hm, so this missing book.

640
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,103
Did you, by any chance?

641
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,160
You bought my book.

642
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,510
You must really like me.

643
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,860
- No, no I don't.

644
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,930
- You bought my book.

645
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:31,350
- I put it under an uneven chair.

646
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,330
- You put it under your pillow

647
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,610
so you could have kissing dreams about me.

648
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:35,573
- Kissing dreams?

649
00:26:36,965 --> 00:26:39,060
(loud laughing)

650
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,350
- I think I'm in sort of art fortress.

651
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,380
I love it.

652
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,650
Stay right there, coming down, don't move.

653
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:45,530
Don't move.

654
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:47,730
Oh, I wish I could just
see you a while ago.

655
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,713
Hey baby, baby.

656
00:26:54,765 --> 00:26:56,413
My God, it looks so good.

657
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,750
Oh my God, it moves me.

658
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,010
It moves me.

659
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,830
Tormented, that's the word that just,

660
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,590
it just came up right out of me.

661
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,423
Tormented.

662
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,533
Oh, it's haunting, isn't it?

663
00:27:08,933 --> 00:27:11,820
You, one word,

664
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,600
one word to describe

665
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,953
this.

666
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,120
- Melancholy.

667
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,953
- Melancholy?

668
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,333
Good fucking word, dude.

669
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:29,973
This is him, Soph.

670
00:27:29,973 --> 00:27:31,040
Soph, this is him.

671
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,880
This is my golden boy.

672
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,670
Listen to me, brother.

673
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:37,340
My work, my work.

674
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,363
It touches people.

675
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,010
I don't know how, I really don't.

676
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:47,010
But what I do is I reach into
people's souls with my lyrics.

677
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,780
And I know that you know what that means

678
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,770
because you do the same
thing with your pictures.

679
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:55,960
No no no no no, I saw your book.

680
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,720
I saw it, and it is raw dude,

681
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,060
it is fucking raw.

682
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,540
That's what I want, no no no no,

683
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,780
that is what I need to do with this shoot.

684
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:10,080
Me in rags against the world, right?

685
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,913
- Julian.

686
00:28:10,913 --> 00:28:11,746
- Julian.

687
00:28:11,746 --> 00:28:12,880
- Julian, you could have
told me that you had-

688
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,440
- I know, I know, I know, I
know, I know, I know, I know.

689
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,580
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
guilty, you caught me.

690
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,710
I just, I had to have him see your work.

691
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,470
I mean, look at this man, look at it.

692
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:23,230
The brushstrokes, the
lines, the shape, the color,

693
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:26,530
the whatever this thing
is here with the writing.

694
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,363
I don't even know what you call that.

695
00:28:27,363 --> 00:28:28,876
You know who does though?

696
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:30,720
Her, because she knows art dude.

697
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,553
She knows it.

698
00:28:31,553 --> 00:28:32,660
She knows art.

699
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,570
No, no, no, no, no, no.

700
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:36,470
She, she is art.

701
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,701
Look at you.

702
00:28:37,701 --> 00:28:39,880
Look at you, art, look at you.

703
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,080
You little piece of art.

704
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,793
Perfect.

705
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:50,090
She comes up to me last
week, and she says, Julian,

706
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:52,350
you have got to see these photos.

707
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:55,323
This guy is shooting with
your voice, she says.

708
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,863
You've got my voice, dude.

709
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,580
I'm looking at him and I'm thinking

710
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:03,010
he is the one, don't you think?

711
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,370
Yeah.
- Yeah.

712
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,980
You, you can see it, I
don't think he sees it.

713
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:11,083
But look, I can trust you.

714
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:15,970
I can trust that you will make this big,

715
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,250
and you will make this deep,

716
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:20,003
and you will make this something true.

717
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,680
- You and him?

718
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,510
- Yeah, yeah.

719
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,343
Yes.

720
00:29:27,343 --> 00:29:29,690
This is my girlfriend,
girlfriend, I'm sorry,

721
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:34,420
my muse, my life force, Sophie.

722
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,240
If it weren't for her,
we wouldn't be here, man.

723
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,490
She is our fucking cupid.

724
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,323
- Julian.

725
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,410
- Oh no, she gets shy around new people,

726
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:43,970
don't take it personally.

727
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:48,623
You and me, we have to
go to my cello lesson.

728
00:29:48,623 --> 00:29:49,456
You ready to go?

729
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:51,440
Hey, did you like the cello, T?

730
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,273
- Sure.

731
00:29:52,273 --> 00:29:53,360
- 'Cause I'm learning it right now.

732
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,640
It's fucking awesome.

733
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,170
All right, we're gonna go though.

734
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,640
You, take it all in, all right.

735
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,010
Stay here, absorb the art.

736
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,310
Feel it, drink it up, it's good for you.

737
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,000
This scares the crap out of me.

738
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,133
Stay away from it.

739
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,400
- I thought we were gonna
talk about the shoot?

740
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,303
- We just did man.

741
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,460
I'm in your hands, T.

742
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,180
You have got to bring it though, brother.

743
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:16,500
It's my words, my music, your pictures.

744
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:20,500
Like so, see that, simpatico, in sync,

745
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,370
peanut butter and jelly.

746
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,670
Whoa whoa whoa whoa,
I'm gonna party tonight.

747
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:25,503
You gotta come by.

748
00:30:25,503 --> 00:30:28,800
It's sort of a going away
on tour sort of a thing.

749
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,633
All right?

750
00:30:29,633 --> 00:30:30,466
So make sure you're there.

751
00:30:30,466 --> 00:30:32,060
I'm gonna have my guy call your guy.

752
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:35,390
They're gonna do what guys do, later dude.

753
00:30:37,517 --> 00:30:39,167
- It was nice meeting you, Tyler.

754
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,600
- Hi.

755
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,127
- You are creepy.

756
00:30:56,808 --> 00:30:57,641
- Okay.

757
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,150
- She's fucking some guy named Jared.

758
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:10,983
- What?

759
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,890
- I used her password.

760
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:17,123
She's been IM-ing some guy
named Jared for six weeks.

761
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,623
Every day.

762
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,073
Really?

763
00:31:24,056 --> 00:31:25,490
We need to grab all of her stuff.

764
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:27,600
All the fucking love notes.

765
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,110
I'm gonna fucking burn 'em.

766
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,060
I'm gonna burn it all.

767
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,460
- Yeah, we'll burn 'em, man.

768
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,700
- I want to suck your voluptuous lips,

769
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,780
as my hands move

770
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:42,650
up and down your slim, beautiful body.

771
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,610
- He wrote that?

772
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:49,870
- No, she did.

773
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:52,743
My girlfriend, my fiance of three years,

774
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:56,510
she wrote that to some
fucking guy named Jared.

775
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,030
- Whoa, whoa!

776
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,210
What is wrong with you?

777
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,709
Come on man.

778
00:32:00,709 --> 00:32:02,700
This guy is nothing compared to you.

779
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,480
Stand you guys next to each other,

780
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,080
every woman in the world
picks you every single time.

781
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,608
You understand me?

782
00:32:09,608 --> 00:32:11,400
Don't worry about this, this is nothing.

783
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,233
Come on.

784
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:14,673
- She said he was better in bed than I am.

785
00:32:15,885 --> 00:32:16,718
- Oh.

786
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:28,003
I got invited to a party.

787
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,060
Let's go.

788
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,893
Huh?

789
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,810
- I really don't think
this was a good idea, Ty.

790
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:40,340
- Just remember, six months.

791
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,090
- That six month thing isn't working.

792
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:44,840
I can't just jump over
the mourning period,

793
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,730
'cause I honestly don't think
I'm ever gonna get over her.

794
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:48,919
- Yeah, you got to believe it.

795
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:50,270
That's kind of the trick.

796
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,860
- Yeah, well I don't believe that.

797
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,690
- Well, I'll have to go
with the dead tactic then.

798
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,780
- Well, pray tell, what's the dead tactic?

799
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,613
- She's dead to you.

800
00:32:57,613 --> 00:32:59,360
You know, she's erased
herself from your reality.

801
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,890
You can't talk to her, you can't see her,

802
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:02,010
she did it, it's her fault,

803
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,813
and here's nothing you can do about it.

804
00:33:04,786 --> 00:33:05,627
- That doesn't make me feel better.

805
00:33:05,627 --> 00:33:07,330
- The feel better tactic didn't work.

806
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:10,810
This is the, don't make an
asshole out of yourself, tactic.

807
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:11,770
Look, you follow those rules.

808
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:12,831
You don't listen to her.

809
00:33:12,831 --> 00:33:13,664
You don't talk to her.

810
00:33:13,664 --> 00:33:14,497
You don't see her.

811
00:33:14,497 --> 00:33:16,103
You don't do anything
with her, six months.

812
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:19,809
- I don't like your rules.

813
00:33:19,809 --> 00:33:21,140
I still feel like shit.

814
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,250
- Oh, let's grab a drink.

815
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,010
Alcohol fixes everything.

816
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:25,523
- Yeah, it does.

817
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:28,713
I'll have a scotch, Senor.

818
00:33:29,791 --> 00:33:30,624
- Two.

819
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:40,900
- Hey, hang out here for a sec, okay?

820
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,740
- Don't leave me, man.

821
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,440
I don't know anyone at this party.

822
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,813
Here we go.

823
00:33:48,274 --> 00:33:51,274
(muffled speaking)

824
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,440
- Hi.

825
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,273
- Hi.

826
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,313
- Hi!

827
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,303
Hey, you know what,

828
00:34:00,303 --> 00:34:02,960
we weren't properly
introduced this afternoon.

829
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,190
Creepy bookstore guy,
Charles Milton, the third.

830
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,023
- Tyler.

831
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:13,160
- Well, I seem to be in the way.

832
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,850
You know who I blame?

833
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,350
My mother and father,

834
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,820
for conceiving, bearing, and raising me.

835
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,380
They just never really considered

836
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,983
how inconvenient it would become for you.

837
00:34:22,983 --> 00:34:23,816
- Okay.

838
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:27,910
- You want to grab a smoke outside or?

839
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:29,790
- Sure, I'd love to.

840
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:30,623
- Excuse us.

841
00:34:30,623 --> 00:34:31,456
- Hey, you know what?

842
00:34:31,456 --> 00:34:32,483
I'm a person.

843
00:34:35,311 --> 00:34:36,400
- You need a cigarette?

844
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,230
- No, actually I don't really smoke much,

845
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:41,780
only on special occasions
like bookstore night.

846
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,100
Actually, stepping outside to smoke

847
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,300
is more of a social crutch.

848
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,210
You know, get away from the crowd,

849
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,510
get a little more privacy.

850
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,460
- And then you figured out that the women

851
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,430
you were stepping outside the smoke with,

852
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:53,500
were more flattered when you weren't

853
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,830
actually stepping outside to smoke,

854
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:57,450
and you just wanted to be alone with them.

855
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:59,963
- I think you might have
a wrong impression of me.

856
00:35:00,841 --> 00:35:01,703
- I don't think so.

857
00:35:01,703 --> 00:35:02,800
I got your number.

858
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,633
- Oh really?

859
00:35:03,633 --> 00:35:04,853
Well, do tell.

860
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,610
- I don't think you can handle it.

861
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,443
- Try me.

862
00:35:11,837 --> 00:35:13,230
- All right.

863
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,800
Here's what I think.

864
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,430
I think that at some point in your life

865
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:19,200
you had this image of what cool is,

866
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,720
I'm guessing probably based
on somebody like Fonzie.

867
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,630
Now you're not Fonzie, okay?

868
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,610
In fact, I think you're kind of a dork,

869
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,500
but you want to be Fonzie.

870
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,380
So you do your best impression
and people actually buy it.

871
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,750
So you keep doing it,

872
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:34,410
but somewhere deep inside,
you know it's still an act,

873
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:35,820
and you can't seem to respect anybody

874
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,070
who would actually fall for it.

875
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:41,280
You put up all these walls so
that people can't know you,

876
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,113
and then you hate them

877
00:35:42,113 --> 00:35:44,210
for not being able to
see through those walls.

878
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,360
That's your problem.

879
00:35:50,188 --> 00:35:52,940
- I don't have a problem.

880
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,240
- That's the saddest part.

881
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:56,893
You don't even know you're broken.

882
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,780
- Whoa! Is that Tyler Watts?

883
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:06,210
World famous photographer at my party.

884
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:09,130
I'm so honored you came Kimosabe.

885
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,433
What is going on with you right now?

886
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,810
- Oh, he's fine.

887
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,190
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

888
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:17,510
He is as high as a kite.

889
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,343
Look at him.

890
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,740
It's all right, man, I feel you brother.

891
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,590
Well, I mean, not actually.

892
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:25,720
Yeah, I gave up stimulants
after I got back from India.

893
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,433
Yeah, six weeks in an ashram
will change you brother.

894
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,280
Anyway, so come on. I want
to introduce you to somebody,

895
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,530
I'm gonna steal her away.

896
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:43,160
- I thought we were so
right for each other.

897
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,560
She just didn't, it's not my fault.

898
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,770
I know a lot of people-

899
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:48,060
- Vodka shot, please.

900
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,817
- It's still her fault.

901
00:36:49,817 --> 00:36:50,930
You son of a bitch.

902
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,090
Come on, man.

903
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:54,880
You take me to a fucking party
where I don't know anyone.

904
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,730
You leave me, and that's
supposed to make me feel better?

905
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:00,183
- I think I'm in love.

906
00:37:01,584 --> 00:37:03,516
- I don't give a fuck.

907
00:37:03,516 --> 00:37:05,110
Son of a bitch.

908
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,970
Okay, I care.

909
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:08,930
With who?

910
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:10,420
- That girl right there.

911
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:13,150
- The one in the purple stockings?

912
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,590
- Yep.

913
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,170
- She's not your type.

914
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,530
- She is now.

915
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,693
Not the regular type, the real type.

916
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:22,130
- That sounds complicated.

917
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:24,290
I have no idea what you're talking about.

918
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:26,030
- All right, there are two types, okay?

919
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:26,980
There's the girl that you date,

920
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,640
and then there's the perfect girl.

921
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,130
The perfect girl, she's too perfect.

922
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:31,140
You know, she makes you nervous,

923
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,347
unsure of yourself, who
wants that kind of hassle?

924
00:37:33,347 --> 00:37:34,180
- Not me.

925
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,013
- So you date the regular type,

926
00:37:35,013 --> 00:37:36,630
the girl who's just off of what you want,

927
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:39,360
so you can be at ease, yet dissatisfied.

928
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,713
- Why would anyone choose
to be dissatisfied?

929
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:46,980
- The alternative is total destruction.

930
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,813
- So,

931
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,483
in fewer words,

932
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,174
she's gonna destroy you?

933
00:37:54,174 --> 00:37:55,830
Is that what you're saying?

934
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,530
- I think she probably will, yeah.

935
00:37:59,096 --> 00:38:01,460
- Is that guy with her? Is that her dude?

936
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,293
- I guess.

937
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,222
- That guy looks like an asshole.

938
00:38:10,342 --> 00:38:12,460
No, don't do it, don't go after her.

939
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,293
- I got it.

940
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:14,743
- I'm alone here again.

941
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:18,795
Fucking asshole.

942
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,740
I guess we can catch up.

943
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,620
- Okay, so first of all,

944
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,570
it's James Bond, not Fonzie.

945
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:33,630
- I stand corrected.

946
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,640
- Second of all, maybe my cool guy persona

947
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,910
is less of an act and more of a test,

948
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,400
a test to see if you're the kind of girl

949
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,530
who falls for such shallowness.

950
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:42,450
- Wow, that was a weak.

951
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,320
- Yeah, that's not true
at all, ignore that.

952
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,293
- Second of all,

953
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,590
I think that you have just as formidable

954
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,330
of a vent mechanism as I have.

955
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,163
- Oh really?

956
00:38:50,163 --> 00:38:50,996
- Yeah, really?

957
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:54,350
You're the girl who dates
the guy who can't handle her,

958
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:55,350
like a certain teenage rockstar.

959
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,920
- He's not a teenager.

960
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,900
- He's a boyfriend that you can control,

961
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,120
somebody that can never
have a piece of you,

962
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,570
a guy that can never make you nervous

963
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:04,080
or self-conscious or sad,

964
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,830
somebody who, no matter how hard they try,

965
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,130
they never understand you.

966
00:39:11,073 --> 00:39:12,610
- He's not my boyfriend.

967
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:13,443
- He said he was your boyfriend.

968
00:39:13,443 --> 00:39:15,330
He said, she's my girlfriend, my muse,

969
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,996
that's what he said.
- Yeah I know, he says that.

970
00:39:16,996 --> 00:39:20,420
He's not my boyfriend, we're
just seeing each other.

971
00:39:24,953 --> 00:39:26,520
You don't know me, Tyler.

972
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,263
- I think we know each other pretty well.

973
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,195
- Okay.

974
00:39:49,195 --> 00:39:50,028
- What's the matter?

975
00:39:50,028 --> 00:39:51,018
- Julian.

976
00:39:51,018 --> 00:39:52,360
- Well, you just said he
wasn't your boyfriend.

977
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,193
- He's not but.

978
00:39:53,193 --> 00:39:54,797
- And you are unbelievably attractive.

979
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,983
- Okay, he's not my boyfriend,
but I'm here with him.

980
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:04,210
This is not right.
- Let's get out of here.

981
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,623
- No, not tonight.

982
00:40:06,629 --> 00:40:08,010
- You're gonna stay here with the kid.

983
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:10,123
- He's not a kid, and yes.

984
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,080
- I want you with me.

985
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,640
- Well you can't have me.

986
00:40:21,259 --> 00:40:22,363
- Oh gosh.

987
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,860
We were together for
three years, you know?

988
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,770
She threw it away.

989
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:30,220
We were supposed to get
married in two months.

990
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,551
- Hey man, let's get out of here.

991
00:40:32,551 --> 00:40:33,440
- Look who's back.

992
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,020
Welcome back, asshole.

993
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,010
- Oh, is this your pal?

994
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:36,850
- Was.

995
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:38,760
- You drag your friend
or club and just run off?

996
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,860
- Dude, that as messed up, bro.

997
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,480
If you were my friend I'd
kick your fucking ass.

998
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,810
- Yeah, pretend he's your
friend and kick his ass.

999
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,550
- You want to stop
inciting the masses here?

1000
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:47,770
- No.

1001
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:49,333
- Come on, let's get out of here.

1002
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,083
- Maybe I'm not ready to go yet.

1003
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:54,420
So there.

1004
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,547
- Okay, great.

1005
00:40:55,547 --> 00:40:56,540
Why don't you get one of your
buddies to drive you home?

1006
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,230
Huh? I'm out of here.

1007
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,820
- Maybe I will.

1008
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,693
Maybe I should go.

1009
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,522
Hey man, come on.

1010
00:41:04,522 --> 00:41:05,570
Are you fucking joking me?

1011
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:07,810
You just leave me waiting
around for your ass all night.

1012
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:08,910
- My girl just blew me off

1013
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:11,590
to spend the rest of the night
with Johnny fuckin' Rockstar.

1014
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,814
- Who cares about Johnny Rockstar, man.

1015
00:41:13,814 --> 00:41:14,647
What about on me?

1016
00:41:14,647 --> 00:41:15,620
I'm fucking exhausted.

1017
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,580
I'm depressed.

1018
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,740
I think I'm developing
a chemical disorder.

1019
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,050
- I mean that is harsh, right?

1020
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:23,200
I mean, look at this guy, I hate this guy.

1021
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,540
- Look let's, we're good, we're back.

1022
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,337
We'll hang out, me and you.

1023
00:41:27,337 --> 00:41:28,270
- You know what?

1024
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:30,010
Hang out here for a second, okay?

1025
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:32,230
- What the fuck man?

1026
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:34,490
- Yeah, I'm your agent,
but I'm also a man,

1027
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:37,830
and I happen to be a man who
thinks that he can love you,

1028
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:39,330
and not in a casual, lusty kind of way,

1029
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,497
but in a real meaningful way.

1030
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,530
- Really?

1031
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,220
- Yeah, really, 'cause you are more

1032
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,739
than just a client to me,

1033
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:49,880
a client who happens to
make a great deal of money

1034
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,340
on a regular basis,

1035
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,740
which is really interesting to me.

1036
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:55,343
- Wow, you should fire him immediately.

1037
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:57,920
- You know you're right, I really should.

1038
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,155
- There he is.
- What are you doing here?

1039
00:42:00,155 --> 00:42:00,988
- I represent you.

1040
00:42:00,988 --> 00:42:02,070
It's a big night for you,
it's a big night for me.

1041
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,010
I'm helping you network.

1042
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:03,910
- Hi.

1043
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:04,743
- Hi.

1044
00:42:04,743 --> 00:42:06,360
- I'm sorry, you know Wendy, my client.

1045
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,320
- Vaguely.

1046
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,750
I shot you a while ago, right?

1047
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:11,190
- Right, I think it was
about two years ago.

1048
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:12,603
- That sounds right.

1049
00:42:13,584 --> 00:42:15,600
- Great, now that we're all
friends let's get to work.

1050
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,560
Julian is right over there.

1051
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,663
So when you go hobnobbing, hey,
come on the model's with me.

1052
00:42:22,687 --> 00:42:24,223
- It's like, no, I'm
not gonna pierce that.

1053
00:42:24,223 --> 00:42:26,120
(Julian laughing)

1054
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,610
Hey hey, T.

1055
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:29,120
- Julian, ha ha.

1056
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,440
Paul Redding, you know I'm
Tyler's representation.

1057
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,480
I'm so glad I can get you
two artists together tonight,

1058
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,620
because I think, and I may be wrong,

1059
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,760
but right here, there
is some creative energy

1060
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,440
that is like gonna explode
the room if we're not careful.

1061
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,370
Over here is Wendy Osborne,
I represent her as a model.

1062
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:46,530
I called Wendy, I said, I'm
going over to Julian's party.

1063
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:47,930
You really got to come with me,

1064
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:50,360
because this artist should meet you,

1065
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,060
because he makes music videos,

1066
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,020
and what's in a music video?

1067
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,360
A model, a model, right.

1068
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,940
And Wendy happens to be a-

1069
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,770
- Model.
- And her name is Wendy?

1070
00:42:57,770 --> 00:42:58,603
- Model?

1071
00:42:58,603 --> 00:43:00,864
- No, it's about it's
Osborne, but it's close.

1072
00:43:00,864 --> 00:43:03,370
(laughing)

1073
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:04,660
- Julian, I'm a really
big fan of your music,

1074
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,820
especially the song you
wrote about the rain.

1075
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,870
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, "April Cowers."

1076
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,440
Yeah, I really nailed it with that one.

1077
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,430
It's all about pain.

1078
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:12,263
You know?

1079
00:43:12,263 --> 00:43:15,070
Everybody's, mine, oh, somebody's cold.

1080
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:16,610
- I'm freezing.

1081
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:18,050
- I hear you're about to go on tour.

1082
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:18,883
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

1083
00:43:18,883 --> 00:43:19,716
in a couple of weeks.

1084
00:43:19,716 --> 00:43:21,700
I'm trying to convince
this one to go with me.

1085
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,469
- Oh, that'll be fun.

1086
00:43:23,469 --> 00:43:27,459
- You know what, you
want to get out of here?

1087
00:43:27,459 --> 00:43:28,350
- Sure.

1088
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:30,710
- Yeah, we're gonna go.

1089
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:31,690
- What?

1090
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:33,470
No no, golden boy, we just got started.

1091
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:34,303
You can't leave.

1092
00:43:34,303 --> 00:43:36,153
- Yeah, golden boy, you can't
leave yet. You just got here.

1093
00:43:36,153 --> 00:43:36,986
- It's okay, Paul.

1094
00:43:36,986 --> 00:43:39,580
You can stay, I'm sure Tyler
will make sure I get home.

1095
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,420
Yeah?

1096
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,253
- Absolutely.

1097
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:43,950
Bye.

1098
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:45,270
- Yeah, all right.

1099
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:47,000
- Have fun. It was
really nice to meet you.

1100
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,094
- Yeah yeah yeah.

1101
00:43:48,094 --> 00:43:49,043
You too.

1102
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,730
- I think something's
going on between those two.

1103
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:52,730
- You think something's going on?

1104
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:53,563
- Really?

1105
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,420
- I think there's something
seriously wrong with me.

1106
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,653
- Yeah, you turned on the light.

1107
00:44:03,653 --> 00:44:04,820
- I'm not kidding, man.

1108
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,050
I am fucked up here.

1109
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:08,053
- [Alan] I like sleeping.

1110
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,893
- I'm acting like a complete
asshole because of this girl.

1111
00:44:11,893 --> 00:44:14,133
- Okay okay, what happened?

1112
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,240
- Okay, so I'm at Wendy's and

1113
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:21,740
I couldn't.

1114
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:24,010
- You couldn't?

1115
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:25,023
- I couldn't!

1116
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,970
- Couldn't get it up?

1117
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:30,420
- Everything was going great.

1118
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:32,523
We we're making out, it was good, nothing.

1119
00:44:34,169 --> 00:44:35,220
- You said she's hot, why?

1120
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:37,303
What, what, what did you do?

1121
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:39,750
- I pretended like I was drunk,

1122
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:42,323
and I acted like I passed out.

1123
00:44:43,899 --> 00:44:45,030
- And she bought it?

1124
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:46,400
- Yeah, she bought it.

1125
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,930
Came up with that, top of
my head, real creative.

1126
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:50,200
So not the point, man.

1127
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,670
I need some help here, come on.

1128
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:53,870
- Stop it, what are you doing?

1129
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,323
Okay, here's the deal.

1130
00:45:02,321 --> 00:45:04,271
It seems like you like this other girl,

1131
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:07,810
and your body, namely, your penis,

1132
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:10,370
has more scruples than you.

1133
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:11,890
- I have no scruples?

1134
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:13,563
- Man, parts of you do.

1135
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,090
- What about her?

1136
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:18,180
We make out in the bathroom,

1137
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,810
and then she goes canoodling
with Johnny Rockstar.

1138
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:21,060
That's okay, that's cool?

1139
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:22,520
I'm the asshole?

1140
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,520
- Are you talking about Wendy?

1141
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,890
- No, not her, the other girl.

1142
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,970
The real type, Sophie.

1143
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:30,360
- Sophie, Sophie.

1144
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,270
Oh, purple leggings?

1145
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:33,580
- Yeah, purple leggings.

1146
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,030
- You fucking hooked up with her

1147
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:37,520
in the bathroom of her boyfriend's party?

1148
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,720
- He's not her boyfriend.

1149
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,940
They're just seeing each other,

1150
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,440
and they wouldn't even
be seeing each other

1151
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,200
if he wasn't in a band.

1152
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,473
- I love you, but you got issues, man.

1153
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:47,833
You want this guy's chick?

1154
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,100
- I do, yeah.

1155
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:50,933
- Okay.

1156
00:45:50,933 --> 00:45:52,380
Then I have a question for you.

1157
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:55,030
Why the fuck would you go
home with someone else, Ty?

1158
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:57,831
- She stayed with him.

1159
00:45:57,831 --> 00:45:58,850
You know, I asked her to come with me.

1160
00:45:58,850 --> 00:45:59,930
I asked her to leave with me.

1161
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:02,870
She wouldn't, what do you want me to do?

1162
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:04,330
- Okay, listen,

1163
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:07,060
you hooked up with her
in the bathroom, right?

1164
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,040
Then you think, she goes home

1165
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,770
and hooks up with Julius tonight?

1166
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:11,740
Is that what you think happens?

1167
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:13,053
You think she's that girl?

1168
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:15,343
- I don't know.

1169
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:21,033
No, I don't think so.

1170
00:46:21,033 --> 00:46:22,750
- I don't think so either.

1171
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:25,921
I don't really know her that well but,

1172
00:46:25,921 --> 00:46:27,324
you did that.

1173
00:46:27,324 --> 00:46:28,741
You are that guy.

1174
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:31,403
- I am that guy.

1175
00:46:31,403 --> 00:46:33,863
- Yeah, pretty fuckin' pimp though.

1176
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:37,830
You fuckin' made that happen real quick.

1177
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:39,070
She's hot too.

1178
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:40,810
I'm going back to bed.

1179
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:41,643
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

1180
00:46:41,643 --> 00:46:43,310
We need to talk about this. What do I do?

1181
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:44,190
- Let me go back to bed.

1182
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:45,090
- No, come on, I fucked up.

1183
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:46,240
You got to help me fix this.

1184
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,060
This is you, help me, help me.

1185
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:51,470
- I'm not the guy with all the
big ideas, bro, that's you.

1186
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:53,520
- I'm the guy whose skillset
involves getting laid,

1187
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,860
not getting into a relationship.

1188
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:56,340
This, your department.

1189
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:57,610
Let's go.

1190
00:46:57,610 --> 00:47:00,023
- I'm not ready for this physical contact.

1191
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:02,553
Okay, all right.

1192
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,170
You have options.

1193
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:06,520
- Okay, I like options.

1194
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:07,900
You can just keep playing your game

1195
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,830
that you play with women.

1196
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:11,110
They seem to love it.

1197
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:11,943
- That's no good.

1198
00:47:11,943 --> 00:47:13,410
My game is all about getting out.

1199
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:18,040
- Okay, you can also just go balls out.

1200
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:18,873
- What's that one?

1201
00:47:18,873 --> 00:47:20,443
- Just tell her how you feel.

1202
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:25,270
You say, you can either be with the zero,

1203
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:27,460
or you can be with the hero.

1204
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:28,830
- Right, right.

1205
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:30,560
And that's what you did with the bitch.

1206
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,883
- Okay, that's harsh.

1207
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,367
That's what I did with that bitch.

1208
00:47:36,367 --> 00:47:37,730
- And that worked?

1209
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:40,060
- I mean, yeah, until she cheated on me

1210
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:43,333
with some fucking dickhead named Jared.

1211
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:46,763
Fuckin' whore.

1212
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:49,460
- You know what I could do?

1213
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:53,440
I could go back to that art gallery,

1214
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,320
try to get her number or something.

1215
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:58,043
- You could do that, uh huh, right.

1216
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:01,890
- It feels a little stalkery doesn't it?

1217
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:03,710
- There is a very thin line

1218
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:08,710
between the balls out
strategy, and actual stalking.

1219
00:48:40,043 --> 00:48:41,050
- So this is weird.

1220
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:42,650
I went back to that art gallery,

1221
00:48:50,591 --> 00:48:53,220
and I talked to that guy,
Charles, I like that guy.

1222
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:56,620
Anyways, I asked him where
you live, and he told me,

1223
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:58,070
which I thought was kind of strange.

1224
00:48:58,070 --> 00:48:59,753
- Did you sleep with that girl?

1225
00:48:59,753 --> 00:49:01,803
- We're jumping right into it, aren't we?

1226
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:08,920
- Really, you know the thing is,

1227
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,830
it's just a strange thing to do.

1228
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:12,713
I mean, why would anybody do that?

1229
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:14,743
Actually, you know what?

1230
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,790
It's not a strange thing.

1231
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:19,430
You fulfilled all of my expectations.

1232
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:20,400
Yeah, I just didn't think

1233
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,250
that you were gonna do it that quickly.

1234
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:25,033
You jumped the ship before
we ever even left the Harbor.

1235
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:28,080
- I didn't sleep with her.

1236
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:28,913
- Right.

1237
00:49:28,913 --> 00:49:31,110
So you just took her home and
gave her a kiss on the cheek

1238
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:33,540
and thanked her for the wonderful evening.

1239
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:34,540
- I was a gentlemen.

1240
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:37,083
Oh, come on.

1241
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,310
I couldn't,

1242
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:43,103
I couldn't perform, okay?

1243
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,213
- What?

1244
00:49:48,213 --> 00:49:49,046
- I was feeling guilty.

1245
00:49:49,046 --> 00:49:51,960
I was thinking about you,
and I couldn't do anything.

1246
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,270
And now I've emasculated myself

1247
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:54,220
in front of all your neighbors,

1248
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:56,060
so I hope that makes you happy.

1249
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:58,670
- Is that like a common problem for you?

1250
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:01,923
- No, look, all this is
beside the point, okay?

1251
00:50:01,923 --> 00:50:03,670
- What is the point?

1252
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:07,220
- The point is that I'm here, I like you.

1253
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:09,970
And I think you might be
my type, my real type,

1254
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:11,253
not just the type I date.

1255
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:14,110
Man, that was stupid.

1256
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:15,620
All right, let me start over.

1257
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:17,310
- No, no, look no,

1258
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:19,770
you have all these rules
and theories about life.

1259
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:21,570
You wanna hear one of my rules?

1260
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:22,403
- Probably not.

1261
00:50:22,403 --> 00:50:23,470
- Don't date guys like you.

1262
00:50:25,163 --> 00:50:26,213
- That's a dumb rule.

1263
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:34,933
- You pissed me off, okay?

1264
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:37,853
You really hurt my feelings.

1265
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,073
I just,

1266
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:43,833
I don't think this is a good idea, at all.

1267
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,330
- So?

1268
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:48,730
- So, I think you should go.

1269
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,663
- Okay, I'll just go.

1270
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:58,933
Really?

1271
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:01,323
- Yes.

1272
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:05,103
- Okay.

1273
00:51:19,787 --> 00:51:22,500
(knocking on door)

1274
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,333
- What?

1275
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:24,166
- Open the door.

1276
00:51:24,166 --> 00:51:25,830
- No.

1277
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:27,600
- I have to tell you something.

1278
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,693
- I don't like you.

1279
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:31,523
- Yeah, you do.

1280
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:36,223
Look, I'm sorry.

1281
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,973
I didn't say that before, and I am, so,

1282
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:42,883
sorry.

1283
00:51:52,513 --> 00:51:54,096
- Oh I am an idiot.

1284
00:51:55,463 --> 00:51:59,213
(uptempo instrumental music)

1285
00:52:01,213 --> 00:52:02,046
Yeah.

1286
00:52:11,913 --> 00:52:12,887
You really didn't sleep with her?

1287
00:52:12,887 --> 00:52:13,720
- No.

1288
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,627
- And then everything
is working (muffled)?

1289
00:52:14,627 --> 00:52:15,983
- That's not even funny.

1290
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:21,937
- This is really stupid.

1291
00:52:21,937 --> 00:52:22,777
- No it's not.

1292
00:52:22,777 --> 00:52:24,330
- You are so totally wrong for me.

1293
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:27,100
- You are perfect for me.

1294
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,337
- I want you to stop.

1295
00:52:28,337 --> 00:52:29,237
- Really?

1296
00:52:29,237 --> 00:52:30,070
- No.

1297
00:53:03,684 --> 00:53:05,437
- Are you going?

1298
00:53:05,437 --> 00:53:06,854
- I was going to.

1299
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:10,493
- Okay.

1300
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:13,040
- I kind of have this rule.

1301
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:15,720
- Right.

1302
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:16,553
Okay.

1303
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:22,080
- I'm sitting here with my boot
in my hand and I'm thinking,

1304
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,633
maybe, maybe I could stay.

1305
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:26,570
Would that be weird?

1306
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:30,270
- No weirder than this conversation.

1307
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:33,770
- I could take you to breakfast
or something in the morning.

1308
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:36,110
- If you want to stay, you should stay.

1309
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:39,083
- Yeah, I want to stay.

1310
00:53:41,834 --> 00:53:42,667
- Okay.

1311
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:44,703
- Okay.

1312
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:47,323
Wow.

1313
00:53:49,277 --> 00:53:51,053
I'm really coming along as a human being.

1314
00:54:12,584 --> 00:54:15,925
Yeah, I guess it is, but I
don't like hearing it like that.

1315
00:54:15,925 --> 00:54:17,591
- It's not a bad thing.
- I like your tattoos.

1316
00:54:19,576 --> 00:54:20,513
Did you realize how much cooler you were

1317
00:54:20,513 --> 00:54:21,787
than me when we met?

1318
00:54:21,787 --> 00:54:24,237
Or was that something
you've grown to learn?

1319
00:54:24,237 --> 00:54:28,677
♪ So we can still be friends ♪

1320
00:54:28,677 --> 00:54:32,760
♪ If only you love me to the end ♪

1321
00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:39,123
- Come on.

1322
00:54:39,123 --> 00:54:40,080
Hemingway, every single guy

1323
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,470
says that Hemingway is
his favorite author,

1324
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:43,060
all that manly shit.

1325
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:46,420
- They say that because he's
one of the best writers ever.

1326
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:48,753
See, that's kind of a thing.

1327
00:54:49,746 --> 00:54:50,920
His reputation.

1328
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:51,930
Well, fair enough, all right.

1329
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:52,763
So what about you?

1330
00:54:52,763 --> 00:54:55,700
What's favorite book, missus smart guy.

1331
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:56,533
- The Stranger.

1332
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:58,513
- Bullshit.

1333
00:54:58,513 --> 00:54:59,346
- I promise you.

1334
00:54:59,346 --> 00:55:00,179
- Bullshit.

1335
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:04,980
Can I tell you something and
be completely honest with you?

1336
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:07,000
This is the best fucking sandwich
I've ever had in my life.

1337
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:07,910
- I told you it was gonna be

1338
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:10,212
absolutely delicious and it was.

1339
00:55:10,212 --> 00:55:11,879
- You're not asleep.

1340
00:55:12,962 --> 00:55:14,045
- I can tell.

1341
00:55:18,936 --> 00:55:20,873
- You smell good. Come on, what
is your real favorite book?

1342
00:55:20,873 --> 00:55:22,700
What is the book you pull out once a year?

1343
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:23,533
Come on.

1344
00:55:25,186 --> 00:55:26,170
- "Wuthering Heights."

1345
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:27,120
- "Wuthering Heights."

1346
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,271
That's the worst book I ever read.

1347
00:55:28,271 --> 00:55:29,530
- No it's not.
- It's terrible.

1348
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:30,480
Are you kidding me?

1349
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:36,020
Well, your taste is embarrassing to me,

1350
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:38,680
but it's okay because I'm
gonna kiss you in this window.

1351
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:39,520
- You're crazy.

1352
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,743
- Oh, you like it, come here.

1353
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:45,212
- I can make omelets.

1354
00:55:45,212 --> 00:55:46,045
I can make-

1355
00:55:46,045 --> 00:55:46,878
- You want some beer?
- Yes.

1356
00:55:46,878 --> 00:55:49,710
I can make a lava-filled chocolate cake.

1357
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:50,543
- Make that.

1358
00:55:54,622 --> 00:55:58,455
♪ I can't tell anymore anyway ♪

1359
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,060
- Oh my God.

1360
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:11,920
Oh my God.

1361
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,230
Did you take this?

1362
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:14,063
- Shut up.

1363
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:18,320
- This is the most delicious,
mouthwatering thing,

1364
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,510
I have ever seen in my life.

1365
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,150
It has made me so hungry.

1366
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:23,170
Can we go to Hut Hut Hamburger?

1367
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:24,647
- That's hilarious
making fun of what I do,

1368
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:25,620
but I love it.

1369
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:27,483
- Come on, that is not what you do.

1370
00:56:27,483 --> 00:56:28,316
- No, it isn't.

1371
00:56:28,316 --> 00:56:30,120
- No, no, what you do is you take

1372
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,620
beautiful pictures that touch people,

1373
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:34,130
and make them think.

1374
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:35,570
You deserve to be made fun of for that.

1375
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:37,050
You're better than that.

1376
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:38,390
- You think?

1377
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:42,130
- Yeah, I don't have crushes
on people who are not talented.

1378
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:43,300
- You have a crush on me?

1379
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,133
- Sporadically.

1380
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,593
So why did you do that?

1381
00:56:50,593 --> 00:56:51,426
- Do what?

1382
00:56:51,426 --> 00:56:52,259
- Sell out.

1383
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:54,553
- Ouch.

1384
00:56:54,553 --> 00:56:56,090
- Seriously?

1385
00:56:56,090 --> 00:56:57,780
- I gotta make a living.

1386
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:59,282
- Whatever.

1387
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:00,403
- I got a pretty good life.

1388
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:03,640
- I think you're sad.

1389
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:17,258
- Okay, okay, I got to go.

1390
00:57:17,258 --> 00:57:18,091
- Okay.

1391
00:57:19,431 --> 00:57:20,430
Was it a good weekend?

1392
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:21,470
- Really, I had a terrible time,

1393
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:23,708
I find you terribly attractive.

1394
00:57:23,708 --> 00:57:24,558
- And you're a liar.

1395
00:57:24,558 --> 00:57:26,208
- Okay, I gotta go.

1396
00:57:26,208 --> 00:57:27,541
Bye bye bye bye.

1397
00:57:31,665 --> 00:57:32,560
I'm sorry, did I just hear you scream?

1398
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:35,300
Unfortunately, this neighborhood
is very unsafe around here.

1399
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:36,610
So luckily I'll just stay here,

1400
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:38,316
and I'll make sure you get in bed okay.

1401
00:57:38,316 --> 00:57:40,800
(laughing)

1402
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:41,633
This girl, man.

1403
00:57:41,633 --> 00:57:44,023
She's a, she's an anomaly.

1404
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:47,650
I think she's awesome.

1405
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:53,231
Hey?

1406
00:57:53,231 --> 00:57:54,381
- What?

1407
00:57:54,381 --> 00:57:55,580
- You okay?

1408
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:57,980
- Yeah, yeah, I just spent three days

1409
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:01,033
trying to figure out how to kill myself.

1410
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:07,613
- I think we need to get you a girl.

1411
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,310
- I don't need pointless, empty sex

1412
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:13,420
to make me feel better, Ty.

1413
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:14,810
That doesn't help me.

1414
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:15,683
I'm not you.

1415
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:22,120
- Alan, it's time I was honest
with you about some things.

1416
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:24,730
I am not the James Bond
that you give me credit for.

1417
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:26,043
- Stop it.

1418
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:29,130
No.

1419
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,980
- Men are hunters.

1420
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:32,900
They're always after their next conquest,

1421
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,230
it is ingrained.

1422
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:36,140
Men in relationships, married men,

1423
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:37,720
they have these needs, too.

1424
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,280
Now how do they fulfill these needs

1425
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,860
without running around on their girls?

1426
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:42,910
How did they do that?

1427
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:45,600
- Masturbation?

1428
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,330
- By living vicariously
through another hunter.

1429
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:49,690
But if that hunter is weak,

1430
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:51,760
if his powers are not especially super,

1431
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,260
you relationship guys,

1432
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:55,260
you start thinking you can do it better.

1433
00:58:56,390 --> 00:59:00,790
In a way, by keeping you
jealous and impressed

1434
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:04,000
by my above average hunting skills,

1435
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,550
I helped keep you happy
in your relationship.

1436
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:08,610
- You think I was with Claire

1437
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:10,640
for a little over two years and 10 months,

1438
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:14,690
because of your above
average hunting skills?

1439
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:17,050
- Yeah, in part.

1440
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:18,520
- I hate to burst your bubble,

1441
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,660
but I don't think you're
that good with women.

1442
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:21,493
- Sure you do.

1443
00:59:21,493 --> 00:59:22,590
All my friends and relationships

1444
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:24,530
think I go home with a
different girl every night.

1445
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:25,363
It's not true.

1446
00:59:25,363 --> 00:59:27,470
I can't just walk up to some
girl in a bar and pick her up.

1447
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:29,000
What I need is the groundwork,

1448
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,330
and that is what I'm going to do for you.

1449
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:34,290
I'm going to provide you with groundwork.

1450
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:35,900
I'm gonna set you up.

1451
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:38,793
- Do not provide me with groundwork.

1452
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:41,910
Not necessary.

1453
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:46,552
- You, me, Sophie, and a yet
to be determined hot girl.

1454
00:59:46,552 --> 00:59:48,027
- I don't, I don't,

1455
00:59:48,027 --> 00:59:49,130
ah, whatever.

1456
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:49,963
- What?

1457
00:59:49,963 --> 00:59:51,470
- All right.
- All right.

1458
00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:52,400
You said yes.

1459
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,670
I got her, she is perfect.

1460
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:55,920
She's a model I took shots
of a couple of months ago,

1461
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,190
and she is single, and she
cannot wait to meet you.

1462
00:59:59,190 --> 01:00:00,380
- Is she cool?

1463
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:01,470
- She's a model.

1464
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:02,303
- Fair enough.

1465
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:05,000
What time?

1466
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,140
- Let's say eight o'clock,
I'll pick up Sophie,

1467
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:10,150
we'll meet you at the bar
just after the photo shoot.

1468
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:11,210
- Thank you, Arthur.

1469
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:13,720
- The shoot with the rockstar hipster guy.

1470
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:14,740
- That's the one.

1471
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:18,260
- Wait, does he know about you and Sophie?

1472
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:19,833
- Whoa, I don't know.

1473
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:22,300
- Is that gonna be uncomfortable?

1474
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:23,390
- I don't know, is it?

1475
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:24,840
- Are you gonna address the issue?

1476
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,850
- I don't know, should I?

1477
01:00:26,850 --> 01:00:28,730
- None of this has occurred to you, Ty?

1478
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:30,800
- Well, I've been thinking
about the girl and the shoot,

1479
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,418
not the connections to each other.

1480
01:00:32,418 --> 01:00:33,490
(knocking on door)

1481
01:00:33,490 --> 01:00:34,360
Shit.

1482
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:35,210
He's here.

1483
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:37,180
- Well, what if you open the door

1484
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:39,447
and he punches you in the face?

1485
01:00:39,447 --> 01:00:41,634
- Do you think she told him?
- I don't know.

1486
01:00:41,634 --> 01:00:42,730
(banging on door)

1487
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:43,563
- [Julian] Hey!

1488
01:00:43,563 --> 01:00:44,396
- Okay, I've gotta go.

1489
01:00:44,396 --> 01:00:45,320
- Just be safe.

1490
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,920
Punch him in the throat,
it'll collapse his trachea.

1491
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:50,723
- Yeah.

1492
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:53,733
Hey.

1493
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,270
- I'm so excited for this shoot, man.

1494
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:02,350
I haven't showered in a week to prep.

1495
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:05,180
I want this shit to be
visceral, you know what I mean?

1496
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:06,870
- Okay, yeah, awesome.

1497
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:08,870
We can do that.
- Oh no, no, no, no, no.

1498
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:11,423
You, you seem nervous.

1499
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:13,510
- I'm excited.

1500
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:14,343
- Excited.

1501
01:01:14,343 --> 01:01:15,176
- Really excited.

1502
01:01:15,176 --> 01:01:16,450
- Yes.
- Yes.

1503
01:01:16,450 --> 01:01:17,943
- Yes.

1504
01:01:17,943 --> 01:01:18,776
- You want to shoot?

1505
01:01:18,776 --> 01:01:19,613
- Yes, we'll shoot.

(muffled speaking)
(muffled song lyrics)

1510
01:01:34,823 --> 01:01:36,997
- [Tyler] Yeah, I like this a
lot. You got nothing to lose.

1511
01:01:36,997 --> 01:01:39,830
You got nothing to lose right now.

1512
01:01:42,947 --> 01:01:44,787
(yelling)

1513
01:01:44,787 --> 01:01:47,287
- I want your head right here.

1514
01:01:53,887 --> 01:01:55,447
Eyes right here.

1515
01:01:55,447 --> 01:02:00,447

1523
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:26,330
- You're a great subject.

1524
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:27,570
I mean, look at this one.

1525
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:28,680
You look really fucked up there.

1526
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,850
- Yeah, that's not modeling dude.

1527
01:02:30,850 --> 01:02:34,253
That's, that's real fucked up-ness.

1528
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:39,290
- You okay?

1529
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:40,690
- Yeah, it's just this girl.

1530
01:02:41,790 --> 01:02:43,163
You met her, Sophie?

1531
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:45,753
- Yeah.

1532
01:02:45,753 --> 01:02:47,180
Cat eye glasses.

1533
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,113
- Love those fucking glasses.

1534
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,020
- You guys having trouble or what?

1535
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:55,250
- She's fading me, man.

1536
01:02:57,860 --> 01:02:59,340
You know, you start talking less and then-

1537
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:01,030
- Yeah I know, I know the fade.

1538
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:04,630
- I invented the shit,
and now she's fading me.

1539
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:06,180
What's the deal?

1540
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:07,310
What's going on?

1541
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:09,590
Everything, everything was so great.

1542
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:10,523
And now,

1543
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:13,973
she's totally over me.

1544
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:16,610
- She flipped the switch.

1545
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,230
- She what?

1546
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:21,340
- Some women have a switch, right?

1547
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:22,910
They keep themselves detached,

1548
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:25,230
so when the time is right,
they can just walk away,

1549
01:03:25,230 --> 01:03:27,133
no strings attached.

1550
01:03:27,133 --> 01:03:30,260
- I'm telling you, a woman
with a switch? Trouble.

1551
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:31,563
- She has a switch?

1552
01:03:32,735 --> 01:03:33,568
- It sucks.

1553
01:03:33,568 --> 01:03:36,370
But hey, I bet you write a
great song about it, huh?

1554
01:03:36,370 --> 01:03:38,500
- Whoa whoa, I'm not done.

1555
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,253
I'm going over there, tonight.

1556
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:45,913
- Why would you go over there tonight?

1557
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:48,123
- Why do you think?

1558
01:03:48,123 --> 01:03:51,790
I'm gonna get her to
flip this switch back on.

1559
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:54,950
- Well, it's a little hard to
get 'em to flip it back on.

1560
01:03:54,950 --> 01:03:55,783
Just saying.

1561
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,173
- But I'm a rockstar.

1562
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:01,083
- Right.

1563
01:04:01,083 --> 01:04:02,550
- Whole different set of rules.

1564
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:04,143
That's pretty cool, actually.

1565
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:06,433
Oh my God, look at me.

1566
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:08,873
What's up?

1567
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:12,750
You're an artiste, my friend.

1568
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:15,010
Don't you know, we smell our own,

1569
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:17,260
and seriously, thank
you for listening to me.

1570
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:19,830
All right, wish me luck!

1571
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:22,593
- Luck.

1572
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:29,290
- Flip that switch!

1573
01:04:30,849 --> 01:04:31,682
Woo!

1574
01:04:39,496 --> 01:04:42,496
(uptempo pop music)

1575
01:05:12,512 --> 01:05:14,090
- No, no, no.

1576
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:15,653
No, no no, don't.

1577
01:05:19,512 --> 01:05:21,270
Uh uh, you're not getting in there.

1578
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:22,793
Stay strong, stay strong.

1579
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:28,753
Don't let him in, don't let him in.

1580
01:05:33,139 --> 01:05:36,889
I met somebody else,
get out of my apartment.

1581
01:05:38,612 --> 01:05:39,863
What the fuck are they doing?

1582
01:05:42,312 --> 01:05:45,062
(phone ringing)

1583
01:05:58,150 --> 01:05:59,600
Hello?

1584
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:01,110
- [Sophie] Hey, it's me.

1585
01:06:01,110 --> 01:06:02,830
- Hey, you.

1586
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:04,010
- Look, I'm really sorry,

1587
01:06:04,010 --> 01:06:06,353
but I'm running about an hour behind.

1588
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:10,520
Yeah, the day has kind
of caught up with me, so.

1589
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:13,550
- You're gonna be there,
a whole hour though?

1590
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:16,693
- Yeah, I can just meet
you guys over at the bar.

1591
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:18,853
- Okie dokie.

1592
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:22,462
- All right, see ya there.

1593
01:06:22,462 --> 01:06:23,295
- See ya.

1594
01:06:42,219 --> 01:06:43,052
Fuck!

1595
01:06:48,252 --> 01:06:50,171
(car starting)

1596
01:06:50,171 --> 01:06:51,421
Son of a bitch!

1597
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:55,737
- Three days later I found out
that she was cheating on me,

1598
01:06:55,737 --> 01:06:57,973
and that really made me feel good.

1599
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:03,080
- You're getting over it now?

1600
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:06,677
Yeah?
- Yeah.

1601
01:07:06,677 --> 01:07:08,163
- And how long ago was this?

1602
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:10,763
- Nine days.

1603
01:07:13,108 --> 01:07:15,441
(coughing)

1604
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:18,440
How's it going, Ty?

1605
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:21,400
- Great, I'm great, I'm
living the dream, I really am.

1606
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,130
This wine is fucking fantastic.

1607
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:24,800
I'm gonna get us another bottle, okay?

1608
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,363
Shelly, another bottle please, thank you.

1609
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:33,810
- Ty tells me that
you're a hot shot model.

1610
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:35,703
That must be fun.

1611
01:07:35,703 --> 01:07:36,536
- It is.

1612
01:07:37,723 --> 01:07:38,820
- Is that how you guys met?

1613
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:41,020
- Oh no, we were actually
seeing each other.

1614
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:44,193
- Romantically?

1615
01:07:45,375 --> 01:07:48,280
- Well, I don't know if it was romantic.

1616
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:50,333
We are certainly having a lot of sex.

1617
01:07:53,150 --> 01:07:53,983
- What?

1618
01:07:57,370 --> 01:07:59,120
- Can I talk to you for one second?

1619
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:09,090
What is wrong with you?

1620
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:11,160
- Look, I got a lot of
stuff going on right now.

1621
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:13,110
I really don't feel like
getting scolded, okay?

1622
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:15,010
- You had sex with her?

1623
01:08:15,010 --> 01:08:16,290
- Months and months ago.

1624
01:08:16,290 --> 01:08:17,123
- So?

1625
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:19,490
You can't hook me up on a date

1626
01:08:19,490 --> 01:08:21,780
with someone you've already dated.

1627
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:22,613
- No, no.

1628
01:08:22,613 --> 01:08:25,430
You can't go out with someone
I dated without telling me.

1629
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:27,440
I know about it, I'm cool with it.

1630
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:28,600
No rule is broken.

1631
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:29,433
- That's not the point.

1632
01:08:29,433 --> 01:08:30,720
- Well what is the point?

1633
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,870
Look, I'm trying to help you
here and you're giving me shit.

1634
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:34,510
Don't get mad at me
just because your fiance

1635
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:36,310
made you look like an asshole, okay?

1636
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:39,340
- Harsh.

1637
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:40,490
I look like an asshole?

1638
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:41,510
- Look.

1639
01:08:41,510 --> 01:08:42,800
- Okay, awesome, awesome.

1640
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,703
Let's get this the fuck over with.

1641
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:53,223
- Hey everybody.

1642
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:54,923
- Hey.

1643
01:08:55,834 --> 01:08:56,667
- It's Alan, right?

1644
01:08:56,667 --> 01:08:57,780
- Yeah, Sophie.

1645
01:08:57,780 --> 01:08:58,793
Nice to meet you.

1646
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:01,640
I've heard a lot about you.

1647
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:02,473
- Oh.

1648
01:09:03,884 --> 01:09:06,260
- Good, it was all good.
Sorry, this is Reese.

1649
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:07,093
- Hi.

1650
01:09:07,093 --> 01:09:08,160
Welcome to the party.

1651
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,420
- Thank you.

1652
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:10,560
I'm sorry I'm late guys.

1653
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,320
I got caught up with paintings.

1654
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:13,850
- Cool, so you're an artist?

1655
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:14,683
- Yeah.

1656
01:09:14,683 --> 01:09:16,710
- She's a really good painter.

1657
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:18,368
- Thank you.

1658
01:09:18,368 --> 01:09:19,201
You've been talking about me?

1659
01:09:19,201 --> 01:09:20,470
- And you said you'd be an hour.

1660
01:09:20,470 --> 01:09:23,680
It's been an hour and 36 minutes, about.

1661
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:26,663
- Yeah, I know, and I
also said I was sorry.

1662
01:09:27,767 --> 01:09:29,910
I'm not usually late like this, but.

1663
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:31,410
- Well, you got caught up with your art,

1664
01:09:31,410 --> 01:09:34,500
making beautiful art for hours on end.

1665
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:35,333
How was it?

1666
01:09:36,570 --> 01:09:37,750
- How was what?

1667
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:38,583
- The art?

1668
01:09:42,024 --> 01:09:43,430
- What are you doing?

1669
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:44,640
- I saw you.

1670
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,290
I saw him go into your apartment.

1671
01:09:47,170 --> 01:09:48,097
- With the rockstar?

1672
01:09:48,097 --> 01:09:50,160
- Oh wow wait, who's the rockstar?

1673
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:51,403
- You were spying on me?

1674
01:09:51,403 --> 01:09:52,563
- I was spying on him.

1675
01:09:53,691 --> 01:09:54,870
- This is the guy that she
was dating before Tyler.

1676
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:55,990
- Oh shit.

1677
01:09:55,990 --> 01:09:58,600
- Wait, why exactly
were you following him?

1678
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,080
- Because he told me he was going

1679
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,760
to your place after the shoot.

1680
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,070
- Okay, so let me get this straight.

1681
01:10:03,070 --> 01:10:05,040
You soak the guy for information,

1682
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,800
while doing a job that I set up for you,

1683
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,691
and then you follow him?

1684
01:10:09,691 --> 01:10:12,160
- You say it like that, I
sound like kind of a dick.

1685
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:15,120
- I guess I just assumed that
you wouldn't talk about me.

1686
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:17,120
- I assumed you wouldn't fuck him.

1687
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,813
Looks like we were both wrong, huh?

1688
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:21,593
- Wow.

1689
01:10:24,428 --> 01:10:26,307
You know what? Go to hell, Tyler.

1690
01:10:31,117 --> 01:10:33,380
- You fucking idiot.

1691
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:34,840
What was that shit?

1692
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,170
Go after her.

1693
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:37,807
- No, I'm not gonna chase her.

1694
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:39,960
- Why?

1695
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:41,077
You've already spied on her

1696
01:10:41,077 --> 01:10:43,620
and made an out of both
of you in this bar.

1697
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:46,580
Why don't you just fucking
commit to the thing and go?

1698
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:48,963
- Yeah, you should really go after her.

1699
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:01,060
- Did you sleep with him?

1700
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:02,030
- What do you think?

1701
01:11:02,030 --> 01:11:03,730
- I want to think that you didn't.

1702
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:06,313
- He wanted to talk.

1703
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:09,390
I told him that I had met someone,

1704
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:11,640
and that I thought it
might be serious, okay?

1705
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:13,760
I owed him that much.

1706
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,160
He's someone I care about.

1707
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:16,680
- You couldn't just tell me that?

1708
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,760
- It's none of your business.

1709
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,170
What did you want me to say?

1710
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:23,000
That I rejected him, and he cried?

1711
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,300
Why?

1712
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:26,363
So that you could feel
like the big winner?

1713
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:30,880
God, that's what this is all about.

1714
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,010
You liked me because I'm a challenge.

1715
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:34,870
And you were jealous
because I was with this kid

1716
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:37,520
that you consider yourself
to be so much better than.

1717
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:39,523
You don't want me.

1718
01:11:40,850 --> 01:11:42,000
You want the war story.

1719
01:11:43,970 --> 01:11:45,310
You want to conquer.

1720
01:11:45,310 --> 01:11:47,770
You want to defeat the
young and talented opponent

1721
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:48,916
and come home with the prize,

1722
01:11:48,916 --> 01:11:49,749
but you know what?

1723
01:11:49,749 --> 01:11:51,480
No, we're done.

1724
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:52,950
This thing is done.

1725
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:53,810
- Just like that?

1726
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:55,030
- Yeah, just like that.

1727
01:11:55,030 --> 01:11:56,160
- Because I was jealous?

1728
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:58,793
- No, no, because I was right about you.

1729
01:12:00,788 --> 01:12:02,988
You're just gonna keep
on sabotaging things.

1730
01:12:04,210 --> 01:12:05,790
You're gonna keep hurting
me until I leave you,

1731
01:12:05,790 --> 01:12:07,300
so what the fuck is the point?

1732
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:09,610
- Wait, no, wait, Sophie.

1733
01:12:09,610 --> 01:12:10,680
I'm sorry.

1734
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:12,150
I'm sorry.

1735
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:14,203
- Why do I have to handle
you? Why is that my job?

1736
01:12:15,398 --> 01:12:17,310
God, you're like this little boy

1737
01:12:17,310 --> 01:12:19,360
who wants a woman to
take all of his problems

1738
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:20,290
and make him feel better about it.

1739
01:12:20,290 --> 01:12:22,440
Well, that's not me, Tyler.

1740
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:23,990
I'm not her.

1741
01:12:23,990 --> 01:12:25,563
I have my own problems, okay?

1742
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:27,920
I want to be happy, too.

1743
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,218
- Okay, what do you want from me?

1744
01:12:30,218 --> 01:12:31,051
- I want,

1745
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:34,620
I want you to be different.

1746
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:37,383
- This is who I am.

1747
01:12:40,698 --> 01:12:41,531
- I know.

1748
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:45,200
Goodbye Tyler.

1749
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:47,510
- Sophie, don't, don't go.

1750
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:49,824
Don't do it, don't do it, Sophie.

1751
01:12:49,824 --> 01:12:50,657
Don't flip the switch.

1752
01:12:50,657 --> 01:12:51,990
Sophie, come on.

1753
01:13:02,447 --> 01:13:03,280
God damn it.

1754
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,163
- Thanks for an amazing evening, Ty.

1755
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,350
- Sorry.

1756
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:15,323
Kenny, scotch.

1757
01:13:19,850 --> 01:13:20,683
She left.

1758
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:23,500
- Figures.

1759
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:24,373
- I fucked it up.

1760
01:13:25,690 --> 01:13:26,523
- Yeah.

1761
01:13:29,058 --> 01:13:29,891
- What are you drinking.

1762
01:13:29,891 --> 01:13:30,724
- No, I'm not drinking.

1763
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:34,060
I want to have compassion
for you right now, Ty,

1764
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:34,893
but I,

1765
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:36,973
I can't.

1766
01:13:37,888 --> 01:13:38,930
- You still mad about the Reese thing?

1767
01:13:38,930 --> 01:13:41,420
- You tried to hook me up with
a girl that you've been with.

1768
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:42,430
That's a power play.

1769
01:13:42,430 --> 01:13:44,220
I know it seems like a really
nice thing you're doing,

1770
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:46,330
but you're just reminding yourself

1771
01:13:46,330 --> 01:13:48,540
that you're better than I am.

1772
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:49,740
- No, I'm not doing that.

1773
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:52,260
- Yes, yes you are.

1774
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:54,170
You do it all the time.

1775
01:13:54,170 --> 01:13:56,090
I know it's not a big deal.

1776
01:13:56,090 --> 01:13:58,213
It's never a big deal
unless it's about you.

1777
01:13:59,826 --> 01:14:01,364
- Come on.

1778
01:14:01,364 --> 01:14:02,914
- You called me an asshole, Ty.

1779
01:14:06,670 --> 01:14:07,963
You don't respect me.

1780
01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:12,573
I've known you almost all my life,

1781
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,610
and somewhere in me I
love you like a brother,

1782
01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:20,233
but right now I can't
even fucking look at you.

1783
01:14:20,233 --> 01:14:22,453
I can't listen to your problems.

1784
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:25,140
I sure as hell can't hear

1785
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:28,420
your theories on life, so spare me.

1786
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:29,990
- Alan.

1787
01:14:29,990 --> 01:14:31,140
- I'm going to a hotel.

1788
01:14:32,978 --> 01:14:34,791
Gotta find an apartment.

1789
01:14:34,791 --> 01:14:36,193
I'm gonna go pack up my shit.

1790
01:14:37,291 --> 01:14:40,778
- Alan, come on, no.

1791
01:14:40,778 --> 01:14:41,611
Alan?

1792
01:14:53,390 --> 01:14:54,223
Hi.

1793
01:14:55,110 --> 01:14:56,670
- So you followed her?

1794
01:14:56,670 --> 01:15:00,203
- No, I followed him to her apartment.

1795
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:03,840
- Ty, is that how tough guys act?

1796
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:05,870
Is that how James Bond would act?

1797
01:15:05,870 --> 01:15:09,890
- I know, I know, she has destroyed me.

1798
01:15:09,890 --> 01:15:11,960
I knew she would, and she did.

1799
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:14,403
I have become the kind of man that I mock.

1800
01:15:15,752 --> 01:15:17,260
- Or you're a romantic.

1801
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:18,447
- Come on, that's
bullshit and you know it.

1802
01:15:18,447 --> 01:15:20,080
I'm not a romantic, I'm a cynic.

1803
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,490
- Cynics are the most romantic.

1804
01:15:22,490 --> 01:15:24,350
And you kick these girls to the curb,

1805
01:15:24,350 --> 01:15:27,700
because they don't match
up to your romantic ideal,

1806
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:32,700
which secretly one day
you hope you'll find.

1807
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:37,280
- You're starting to talk
like me, you realize this?

1808
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:38,930
- You have quite an effect on me.

1809
01:15:39,810 --> 01:15:42,623
- Wendy, wait.

1810
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:45,110
- Let me get this straight.

1811
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:47,810
You're rejecting me for
some forlorn 20-something

1812
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:48,920
who wants nothing to do with you?

1813
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:50,320
Is that about right?

1814
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:51,760
- I've had such a shitty night.

1815
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,310
- Then what are you doing here?

1816
01:15:55,216 --> 01:15:57,316
- You know, I thought maybe we could talk.

1817
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:00,543
- Talk?

1818
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,840
You're such an idiot, Tyler.

1819
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:08,150
All this melodramatic romantic bullshit

1820
01:16:08,150 --> 01:16:09,880
about her destroying you.

1821
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,010
You want to see somebody destroyed?

1822
01:16:11,010 --> 01:16:12,450
You want to see someone really fucked up?

1823
01:16:12,450 --> 01:16:14,100
Take a look over here, smart guy.

1824
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:17,313
- Wendy,

1825
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:20,120
I'm sorry.

1826
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:22,090
- Oh God, don't.

1827
01:16:22,090 --> 01:16:24,290
Don't say you're sorry, don't.

1828
01:16:24,290 --> 01:16:26,830
You think she's so perfect for you?

1829
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:28,823
I'm perfect for you, I am.

1830
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:31,197
You can't see that, can you?

1831
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,763
I'm just some girl you fuck.

1832
01:16:36,290 --> 01:16:37,890
- You're one of my best friends.

1833
01:16:47,537 --> 01:16:49,816
(groaning)

1834
01:16:49,816 --> 01:16:54,027
- I'm in love with you, you fucking idiot.

1835
01:16:54,027 --> 01:16:56,923
- Oh, you hit me in the head with a phone.

1836
01:16:57,900 --> 01:16:58,833
I'm bleeding.

1837
01:17:01,970 --> 01:17:02,803
- You okay?

1838
01:17:03,650 --> 01:17:06,230
- Seriously, this day really sucks.

1839
01:17:06,230 --> 01:17:07,880
- I'm gonna ask you to leave now.

1840
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:23,540
- You're one of my only friends.

1841
01:17:25,630 --> 01:17:26,930
I don't want to lose that.

1842
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:31,670
- That's very gracious of you,

1843
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:35,563
but I can't pretend to be
your friend anymore, Tyler.

1844
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:49,873
- I didn't know.

1845
01:17:51,130 --> 01:17:52,030
- You should have.

1846
01:17:57,736 --> 01:18:00,486

1852
01:18:26,690 --> 01:18:29,520
for a week and now it's official.

1853
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,793
Hut Hut Hamburger has fired you.

1854
01:18:33,220 --> 01:18:36,480
And as far as our
relationship is concerned,

1855
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:39,280
I really don't think it's working out.

1856
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:41,653

1858
01:18:44,286 --> 01:18:46,620
I'm just under a lot of
pressure here at the office.

1859
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:49,290
I'm really just sorry
it had to end this way.

1860
01:18:49,290 --> 01:18:50,900
- Come on, Tyler.

1861
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:52,600
There's plenty of girls out there.

1862
01:18:53,810 --> 01:18:54,910
I'm not helping, am I?

1863
01:18:56,007 --> 01:19:00,216
- [Paul] But I hope that
we can still be friends.

1864

(knocking on door)

1865
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:02,813
- Ty.

1866
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:06,593
Open the door.

1867
01:19:10,192 --> 01:19:11,553
Look, I know you're going
through a hard time,

1868
01:19:11,553 --> 01:19:12,953
but you can't just shut off.

1869
01:19:14,093 --> 01:19:16,107
Look man, I want to talk to you.

1870
01:19:16,107 --> 01:19:17,030
I want to talk to you,

1871
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:19,980
but I'm not gonna do it through
a fucking closed door, man.

1872
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:23,823
I moved, I found a place.

1873
01:19:25,580 --> 01:19:26,603
You should come by.

1874
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:28,887
I miss you buddy.

1875
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,120
Come on man, stop being a bitch.

1876
01:19:37,216 --> 01:19:38,253

- [Tyler] Like this?
- Yeah, a little bit more.

1880
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:58,100
No, back down, just okay.

1881
01:19:58,100 --> 01:19:59,650
Leave it alone, leave it alone.

1882
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:06,053
You know, I think I like
that one the best, Tyler.

1883
01:20:07,180 --> 01:20:08,013
- This one?

1884
01:20:08,013 --> 01:20:08,846
- Yeah.

1885
01:20:09,950 --> 01:20:10,783
- How come?

1886
01:20:11,780 --> 01:20:12,980
- It's about friendship.

1887
01:20:14,390 --> 01:20:16,783
- You don't think it's, corny?

1888
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:20,250
- Timeout, timeout.

1889
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:21,230
I say I like the thing,

1890
01:20:21,230 --> 01:20:23,420
therefore I'm corny,
is what you're saying.

1891
01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:26,240
Tyler, in case you haven't
noticed, I own a fucking bar.

1892
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:28,860
I have sleeve tattoos, I wear
vintage concert T-shirts.

1893
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:30,250
I am not corny.

1894
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:32,780
Look, I'm not gonna get into
some artistic debate with you

1895
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:33,820
on why I fucking liked the thing,

1896
01:20:33,820 --> 01:20:36,070
I just like it, is it
not okay for me to say?

1897
01:20:38,479 --> 01:20:39,779
You're a fucking dick man.

1898
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:41,973
- Sorry.

1899
01:21:12,352 --> 01:21:13,860
- Hey.

1900
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:14,910
- Who is it, sweetie?

1901
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:22,250
- So, you two?

1902
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:24,320
- I went to your place to get some stuff,

1903
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,260
and to check the messages.

1904
01:21:26,260 --> 01:21:28,180
- And I'd popped in to check on you,

1905
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:29,310
because I felt really badly about

1906
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:32,802
throwing the phone and how you left.

1907
01:21:32,802 --> 01:21:37,337
- And, we started talking
about you at first.

1908
01:21:37,337 --> 01:21:39,260
- [Wendy] And how pissed
we both were at you.

1909
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:40,663
- Yeah and then,

1910
01:21:41,723 --> 01:21:43,510
I think subconsciously

1911
01:21:45,170 --> 01:21:48,157
we kind of did it initially
just to get back at you.

1912
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:52,325
- Yeah, I don't think it was subconscious.

1913
01:21:52,325 --> 01:21:54,517
- No, it was pretty conscious.

1914
01:21:55,370 --> 01:21:57,587
Something amazing came out of it.

1915
01:21:59,890 --> 01:22:01,110
- Seriously.

1916
01:22:01,110 --> 01:22:01,943
This.

1917
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:04,310
I like it.

1918
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:05,962
Congratulations.

1919
01:22:05,962 --> 01:22:07,602
- Thank you.

1920
01:22:07,602 --> 01:22:08,900
How are you?

1921
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:09,733
- I'm good.

1922
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:12,670
What do I got?

1923
01:22:12,670 --> 01:22:15,420
Actually, the reason I
came by was to tell you

1924
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:18,010
that I've got some new
shots hanging in the bar.

1925
01:22:18,010 --> 01:22:18,843
If you want to-

1926
01:22:18,843 --> 01:22:20,620
- That's great, your photography is up.

1927
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:22,930
- Yeah, Kenny thinks he
might be able to sell some.

1928
01:22:22,930 --> 01:22:24,610
- Ty, that's fantastic.

1929
01:22:24,610 --> 01:22:25,443
- Thanks.

1930
01:22:28,230 --> 01:22:30,400
- Whatever happened with Sophie?

1931
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:33,573
- Oh, well I ruined it.

1932
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,900
I think she moved, or something.

1933
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:38,470
I don't know, I've lost her.

1934
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:42,067
- Yeah, it sounds like you're
still thinking about her.

1935
01:22:43,525 --> 01:22:44,358
- Yeah.

1936
01:22:45,362 --> 01:22:47,195
- I'll be right back.

1937
01:22:49,350 --> 01:22:50,183
- What happened, man?

1938
01:22:50,183 --> 01:22:53,103
You know, it's been more than six months.

1939
01:22:54,510 --> 01:22:55,650
- So?

1940
01:22:55,650 --> 01:22:57,350
- So what about your fucking rule?

1941
01:22:58,270 --> 01:23:00,930
Any guy can get over
any girl in six months?

1942
01:23:00,930 --> 01:23:02,720
- Yeah, well apparently that rule

1943
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:05,543
doesn't really hold up to scrutiny.

1944
01:23:07,330 --> 01:23:09,040
- Yeah, no shit.

1945
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,003
- No shit.

1946
01:23:12,090 --> 01:23:14,890
- Paul wants me to go to this tonight.

1947
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:18,501
He's still trying to get Julian
to use me in a music video.

1948
01:23:18,501 --> 01:23:19,588
- Baby, we have dinner plans tonight.

1949
01:23:19,588 --> 01:23:20,652
- I know baby, it's date night.

1950
01:23:20,652 --> 01:23:21,485
We're not going.

1951
01:23:21,485 --> 01:23:22,903
- Okay.

1952
01:23:22,903 --> 01:23:25,643
It's not like she would
be at that thing anyway.

1953
01:23:26,610 --> 01:23:27,933
- Oh no she'll be there.

What the hell are you doing
here, creepy bookstore guy?

1961
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,220
- I'm looking for Sophie.

1962
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:06,400
- That's interesting.

1963
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,855
I was under the impression
you two no longer spoke.

1964
01:24:08,855 --> 01:24:10,270
- Well, I'm hoping to change that.

1965
01:24:10,270 --> 01:24:12,503
- Yeah, at Julian's party.

1966
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:15,530
Very dramatic.

1967
01:24:15,530 --> 01:24:17,600
- It very well could be, yeah.

1968
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,205

Thank you for coming.

All right, this next one,

1974
01:24:44,970 --> 01:24:46,823
we're gonna slow it down a little bit.

1975
01:24:47,690 --> 01:24:50,593
It's about true love, all
the trouble that it brings.

1976
01:24:51,780 --> 01:24:55,113
And it involves a cello.

1977
01:24:56,230 --> 01:24:58,730

1982
01:25:40,364 --> 01:25:42,870

- Yeah, what he said.

1983
01:25:43,990 --> 01:25:46,570
- Okay, well right now is
not a good time for this.

1984
01:25:46,570 --> 01:25:47,950
- Well, it's the only time I've had.

1985
01:25:47,950 --> 01:25:49,050
You disappeared on me.

1986
01:25:50,105 --> 01:25:51,920
- Look, I broke up with you, okay?

1987
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,810
- Well yeah, after the first fight we had.

1988
01:25:53,810 --> 01:25:54,888
- He has a point.

1989
01:25:54,888 --> 01:25:55,721
You really didn't give
him much of a chance.

1990
01:25:55,721 --> 01:25:56,838
- Thank you.

1991
01:25:56,838 --> 01:25:57,700
- Well, that's because I
knew he couldn't change.

1992
01:25:57,700 --> 01:25:59,590
- Oh, how can you know?
- Charles, shut up.

1993
01:25:59,590 --> 01:26:01,723
I am not having this discussion right now.

1994
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:05,623
- She does have a tendency
to shut down emotionally.

1995
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:15,540
- So that's it, you can just turn it off?

1996
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:17,612
You just flip your switch
and you're over me?

1997
01:26:17,612 --> 01:26:19,740
- I don't have a switch.
- So you're not over me?

1998
01:26:19,740 --> 01:26:20,660
- That's not what I said.

1999
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:22,240
- You haven't said anything.

2000
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:24,210
- Hey, hey, do you mind, man?

2001
01:26:24,210 --> 01:26:26,833
I'm kind of in the
middle of something here.

2002
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:29,153
- Sorry.

2003
01:26:30,210 --> 01:26:32,080
- Whoa, golden boy.

2004
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:33,300
Hey, it's good to see you.

2005
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:35,440
Guys, this guy is crazy talented,

2006
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:38,683
but seriously T, I am kind of
in the middle of something.

2007
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:41,220
- I'm here for the girl.

2008
01:26:44,510 --> 01:26:47,563
I messed things up and I
want to make them right.

2009
01:26:50,450 --> 01:26:54,593
- Whoa, what, what girl you talking about?

2010
01:26:56,090 --> 01:26:56,923
- That one.

2011
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:02,580
- Brody, what the hell
is happening here, dude?

2012
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:04,270
- Julian, can we just
talk about this later

2013
01:27:04,270 --> 01:27:05,350
when you're not on stage?

2014
01:27:05,350 --> 01:27:07,000
- No, no, he messed things up.

2015
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,143
When were thing's not messed up?

2016
01:27:10,830 --> 01:27:11,833
- He's the guy.

2017
01:27:15,890 --> 01:27:17,410
- The guy?

2018
01:27:17,410 --> 01:27:18,483
Oh my God.

2019
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:22,233
I'm feeling so violated right now.

2020
01:27:24,470 --> 01:27:26,320
Were you sexing her during our shoot?

2021
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:28,600
- It was a bad situation.

2022
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:32,540
- Julian.

2023
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:34,253
- You are an asshole.

2024
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:37,900
- Okay, all right.

2025
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:38,740
I guess I deserved that.

2026
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:40,370
So I'm gonna walk away.

2027
01:27:40,370 --> 01:27:42,620
But you need to know
that I do not walk away.

2028
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:45,972
- Well, I don't do this!

2029
01:27:45,972 --> 01:27:48,139
(yelling)

2030
01:27:49,385 --> 01:27:51,635
(yelling)

2031
01:28:01,790 --> 01:28:03,053
Rock and roll!

2032
01:28:04,348 --> 01:28:05,230
Soph?

2033
01:28:05,230 --> 01:28:06,230
Where are you going?

2034
01:28:26,780 --> 01:28:28,500
- You sure know how to woo a girl.

2035
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:30,298
- He started it.

2036
01:28:30,298 --> 01:28:31,650
- Yeah, well, some might
argue that you started it

2037
01:28:31,650 --> 01:28:33,693
by showing up here in the first place.

2038
01:28:34,922 --> 01:28:36,210
Are you okay?

2039
01:28:36,210 --> 01:28:37,760
- Depends.

2040
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:39,940
You want to be my girlfriend?

2041
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:41,130
- No.

2042
01:28:41,130 --> 01:28:42,400
- Yeah, you do.

2043
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:43,550
- No, I don't.

2044
01:28:43,550 --> 01:28:45,080
- You like me so much it scares you,

2045
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:46,410
that's why you've been hiding from me.

2046
01:28:46,410 --> 01:28:48,040
Come on.

2047
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:50,162
- I wasn't hiding from you.

2048
01:28:50,162 --> 01:28:51,062
I was out of town.

2049
01:28:54,490 --> 01:28:55,323
- Oh man.

2050
01:28:57,650 --> 01:28:59,550
You went on tour with him, didn't you?

2051
01:29:01,450 --> 01:29:03,523
Oh man, that's disappointing.

2052
01:29:05,490 --> 01:29:07,400
Okay, all right.

2053
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:09,740
Tell me, tell me that you love him.

2054
01:29:09,740 --> 01:29:12,203
Tell me you love him and
I'll walk away right now.

2055
01:29:17,835 --> 01:29:18,668
Because you don't love him.

2056
01:29:18,668 --> 01:29:20,410
You don't, you're just
with him because he's safe,

2057
01:29:20,410 --> 01:29:22,195
and because he can never
have a part of you,

2058
01:29:22,195 --> 01:29:24,025
and because you're scared
that I'm gonna fuck it up.

2059
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:26,098
- You would.

2060
01:29:26,098 --> 01:29:27,015
You would.

2061
01:29:28,448 --> 01:29:29,400
And when you get tired of me,

2062
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:32,140
we'll go out for a drink
and you'll give me some line

2063
01:29:32,140 --> 01:29:34,050
about how tough this all is for you,

2064
01:29:34,050 --> 01:29:36,650
and you'll cut me loose, and I'll cry.

2065
01:29:36,650 --> 01:29:38,843
And I don't want to cry anymore.

2066
01:29:40,670 --> 01:29:43,120
- You're gonna throw away
everything that we had,

2067
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,810
because you're scared?

2068
01:29:44,810 --> 01:29:48,963
- Ty, we had one weekend, six months ago.

2069
01:29:53,248 --> 01:29:54,081
- Don't say it like that,

2070
01:29:54,081 --> 01:29:55,193
you sound kind of like a nut.

2071
01:29:58,090 --> 01:30:00,190
I can't promise that I won't let you down,

2072
01:30:01,698 --> 01:30:02,698
but I don't want to.

2073
01:30:04,460 --> 01:30:06,160
I want to be codependent with you.

2074
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:10,753
I want to not be able to work
the TV remote without you.

2075
01:30:12,070 --> 01:30:14,810
I want to not be able to pick out a tie.

2076
01:30:14,810 --> 01:30:17,680
I want to forget whether
or not I like curry.

2077
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:20,553
I want to give up a part
of myself to have you.

2078
01:30:22,110 --> 01:30:23,843
I've never felt like that before.

2079
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:29,640
I gave up my apartment,
I got fired from my job.

2080
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:33,580
I just got a drink thrown at
my face and I walked away.

2081
01:30:33,580 --> 01:30:37,403
I haven't had sex in a
really, really long time.

2082
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:40,483
I am unbelievably miserable,

2083
01:30:43,410 --> 01:30:44,710
but I'm better than I was,

2084
01:30:47,032 --> 01:30:49,032
and it's because of you.

2085
01:30:52,485 --> 01:30:54,150
- That's pretty good.

2086
01:30:54,150 --> 01:30:55,200
- I want to kiss you.

2087
01:30:57,210 --> 01:30:58,272
- No.

2088
01:30:58,272 --> 01:30:59,522
- I'm going to.

2089
01:31:00,712 --> 01:31:04,629
(romantic instrumental music)

2090
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:14,723
- No, wait, no, this is not good.

2091
01:31:17,070 --> 01:31:18,063
- He's not the guy.

2092
01:31:19,390 --> 01:31:20,930
- He's what I need.

2093
01:31:20,930 --> 01:31:21,763
- Sophie?

2094
01:31:26,350 --> 01:31:27,183
I love you.

2095
01:31:32,085 --> 01:31:33,585
- It's not enough.

2096
01:31:37,710 --> 01:31:38,560
- It's all I got.

2097
01:31:54,122 --> 01:31:55,455
It was worth it.

2098
01:31:59,603 --> 01:32:00,703
I was worth it for me.

2099
01:32:09,612 --> 01:32:12,772
It seemed like more than a
weekend though, didn't it?

2100
01:32:12,772 --> 01:32:14,105
- Yeah, it did.

2101
01:32:30,770 --> 01:32:31,920
- She's watching me go.

2102
01:32:33,330 --> 01:32:34,553
She still likes me.

2103
01:32:41,208 --> 01:32:44,541
(solemn acoustic music)

2104
01:32:57,581 --> 01:32:58,750
- Do you know what time it is mister?

2105
01:32:58,750 --> 01:32:59,900
I've been waiting here.

2106
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:02,133
- Hey.

2107
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:05,150
- So you didn't get the girl?

2108
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:13,833
- No.

2109
01:33:20,330 --> 01:33:21,163
- Are you okay?

2110
01:33:27,390 --> 01:33:29,920
- So the old ball and
chain let you out, huh?

2111
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:30,820
On a school night.

2112
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:35,630
- I told her I was worried about you.

2113
01:33:36,930 --> 01:33:40,000
I told her that I wanted
to see my best friend

2114
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
'cause I was worried about him,

2115
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,007
and girls are suckers for
feelings, so here I am.

2116
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:49,993
- Well played.

2117
01:33:51,850 --> 01:33:54,723
- Shall we stand here longer
and not share our feelings?

2118
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:57,483
Or we could go to the bar.

2119
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:01,333
- Bar.

2120
01:34:02,870 --> 01:34:03,703
Bar.

2121
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:08,010
- Hey, do you remember that rule?

2122
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:12,900
Who needs women when you
have a friend like me?

2123
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:14,740
- Wow, that is not making me feel

2124
01:34:14,740 --> 01:34:16,292
any better at all right now.

2125
01:34:16,292 --> 01:34:18,530
- All right, well I tried
the feel better tactic,

2126
01:34:18,530 --> 01:34:20,100
that didn't work.

2127
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:22,550
So now I'm trying the
