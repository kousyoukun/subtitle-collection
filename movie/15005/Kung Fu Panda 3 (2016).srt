1
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,400
好多台阶
Stairs.

2
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:40,740
我不行了...
I don't think I can...

3
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:44,350
各位  别等我了
You guys, just start without me.

4
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,320
我等会就来
I'll catch up!

5
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,410
真棒
Sweet.

6
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,120
心如止水
Inner peace.

7
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,920
心如止水
Inner peace.

8
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,680
鼻子好痒
Itchy nose.

9
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,600
终于可以  心如止水
Finally, inner peace.

10
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,430
又怎么了
Now what?

11
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,980
天煞  老朋友
Kai, old friend.

12
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,890
乌龟大师
Master Oogway.

13
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:00,220
我们的较量五百年前就结束了
Our battle ended 500 years ago!

14
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,920
我准备好再战一场了
Well, now I'm ready for a rematch.

15
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,410
你耽搁挺久啊
Took you long enough!

16
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,450
你变强了
You've grown stronger.

17
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,210
在灵界里待上五百年
500 years in the Spirit Realm,

18
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,780
总能学到点东西
you pick up a thing or two.

19
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:37,530
我把这里每位大师的气都拿到手了
I have taken the chi of every master here.

20
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,550
-不可能  -没错
- No! - Yes.

21
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,540
很快  我也将拥有你的力量
And soon I will have your Power, too.

22
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,570
你什么时候才能明白
When will you realize?

23
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,280
得之越多  失之越多
The more you take, the less you have.

24
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,030
有了你的气
With your chi,

25
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,530
我终于能够回到凡界
I will finally be able to return to the mortal world.

26
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:16,930
这一次  你就没法在那里阻止我了
And this time, you won't be there to stop me.

27
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,800
阻止你从来不是我的使命
It was never my destiny to stop you.

28
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,370
我早已另托他人
I have set another on that path.

29
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,010
那我就会找到他
Then I will find him...

30
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,040
把他的气也夺走
and take his chi, too.

31
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,270
正义即将降临
Justice is about to be served!

32
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,040
请给我们来两份正义拼盘
We'll have two justice platters, please.

33
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,060
-来三份  -三份
- Um... three. - Three.

34
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,270
再来几个豆腐包
And a few tofu buns.

35
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,600
给悍娇虎再来碗红汤面条
Oh, the spicy noodle soup for Tigress.

36
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,020
你要多加酱料吗
Did you want extra sauce with that?

37
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,970
她喜欢酱料分开装
She wants it on the side.

38
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,460
-分开装  -分开装
- On the side. - On the side.

39
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,240
-加油  神龙大侠  -你一定行
- Go, Dragon Warrior! - You can do it!

40
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,510
加油  神龙大侠
Go, Dragon Warrior!

41
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,830
守卫山谷
Defend the valley!

42
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,470
神龙大侠
Dragon Warrior!

43
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,500
加油  神龙大侠
Go, Dragon Warrior!

44
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,520
守卫山谷
Defend the valley!

45
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,350
你们没有摆那霸气威武的造型吧
You guys aren't doing the dramatic Pose, are you?

46
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,870
我们非得每次落地都要摆造型吗
Do we have to strike a Pose every time we land?

47
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,660
各位  永远不要低估了
You guys, never underestimate

48
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,270
闪亮登场的重要性
the Power of a dramatic entrance.

49
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,930
我听说有些大师单凭踹开大门
I've heard about some masters who can win a fight

50
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,580
就能赢得较量
just by throwing open a door.

51
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,830
闪亮登场
Dramatic entrance?

52
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,050
师父
Master Shifu.

53
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,110
神龙大侠说得对
The Dragon Warrior is correct.

54
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,180
真的吗  我刚刚只是瞎...
Really? I was just making...

55
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,710
对  没错  我是对的
Uh, yeah. I mean, yeah. I am.

56
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,010
攻人先攻心
Before the battle of the fist comes the battle of the mind.

57
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,840
因此  需要闪亮登场
Hence, the dramatic entrance.

58
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,090
真够闪亮的  今天是什么日子
Nice dramatic entrance. What's the occasion?

59
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,940
今天是我教的最后一课
Today will be my final class.

60
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,420
最后一课  等等
Your final...? Wait.

61
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,140
我都不知道你生病了
I didn't even know you were sick!

62
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,470
尽管你看上去确实...
Although you have been looking a little...

63
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,270
我没生病
I'm not sick.

64
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,830
健康  有点健康  非常健康
...healthy. A little healthy. A lot, actually.

65
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,120
这是最后一课  因为从今天开始
My final class, because from now on...

66
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,030
你们的训练将会交给
your training will be in the hands

67
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,150
神龙大侠
of the Dragon Warrior.

68
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,960
什么
What?

69
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,020
我来授课  怎么不是悍娇虎
Me, teach? Why not Tigress?

70
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,620
她一直指挥大家做事情
She's always telling everyone what to do.

71
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,460
闭嘴  阿宝
Be quiet, Po.

72
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,470
看到了没
You see what I mean?

73
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,760
悍娇虎不是神龙大侠
Tigress is not the Dragon Warrior.

74
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:33,820
你才是
You are.

75
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,490
拜托  他们是盖世五侠
Come on, they're the Five.

76
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,900
我能教他们什么
What could I teach them?

77
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,140
学海无涯  即使你是大师
There is always something more to learn, even for a master.

78
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,540
比如说
For instance...

79
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,610
让我再教你一招
let me show you another move...

80
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,230
闪亮退场
the dramatic exit.

81
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,530
那是什么
What's that?

82
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,370
开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?

83
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,010
他去哪了
Where'd he go?

84
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,470
师父
Master.

85
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,860
他都走了  各位  没事的
He's gone, guys. It's cool.

86
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,920
请您指教  师父
We await your instruction, master.

87
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,670
教得不好  顶多砸了招牌
All you have to lose is our respect.

88
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,920
说真的  还能有多糟
I mean, seriously, how bad can it be?

89
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,470
非常糟  非常非常糟糕
Very bad! Very, very bad!

90
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,460
好了  好了  大家交换一下
Okay, okay. Let's switch it up.

91
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,530
金猴  不动如山
Monkey! Immovable mountain stance!

92
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,610
是  师父
Yes, master!

93
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,130
悍娇虎  旋风后空翻
Tigress, tornado back flip!

94
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,320
是  师父
Yes, master.

95
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,190
不好  火
Oh, no! Fire!

96
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,550
-点火  -停下来
- Fire! - Stop!

97
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,310
对不起  我错了
Sorry! My fault.

98
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,170
仙鹤  飞高点
Crane, go high.

99
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,740
我是说低点  低点
I mean low! Low!

100
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,230
我的小爪子
Ah, my claw thingy!

101
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,120
灵蛇和悍娇虎  做那个
Uh, Viper and Tigress, do,

102
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,210
虎踞蛇盘五毒大法
uh, like, a totem pole poison technique!

103
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,150
你们两个  万蚁蚀象
You two, do a swarming insect bite...

104
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:47,250
神龙摆尾  金钟罩  铁砂掌
with a yellow tail, yellow jacket, spicy tuna...

105
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,280
对不起
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,610
你真行  阿宝
Good job, Po.

107
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,740
你们学到什么了吗
Did you at least learn a little something?

108
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:01,790
学到了
Yes.

109
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,950
你确实不会教
That you can't teach.

110
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,800
还有  原来悍娇虎是可燃的
And Tigress is flammable, it turns out.

111
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,190
那完全是场灾难
Yeah, that was a complete disaster.

112
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,230
真庆幸我们不是阿宝
Uh, I'm glad we're not Po right now.

113
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,390
他太差劲了
What a loser!

114
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,600
师父到底怎么想的
What was Shifu thinking?

115
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,370
乌龟到底怎么想的
What was Oogway thinking?

116
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,740
我觉得他听到了
I think he heard us.

117
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,250
我什么都没听到
I didn't hear anything.

118
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,820
他说你很差劲
Uh, he said you're a loser.

119
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,680
对不起  乌龟
I'm sorry, Oogway.

120
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,980
你能不能别再这样了
Would you stop doing that?

121
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,560
第一天授课感觉如何
How was your first day teaching?

122
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,010
特别丢脸
Humiliating.

123
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,980
我听说了
I heard.

124
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,630
谁告诉你的  悍娇虎吗
Who told you? Did Tigress tell you?

125
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,240
我听金猴  仙鹤  螳螂
I heard from Monkey, and Crane, and Mantis...

126
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,700
你爸爸  礼品店的曹太太
and your dad, and Mrs. Chao from the gift shop...

127
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,250
刚刚路过你的那群鸭子
and those ducks you just passed...

128
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,490
当然悍娇虎也说了
and Tigress told me.

129
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,860
她有没有告诉你不会有第二次了
Did she also tell you that it'll never happen again?

130
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,610
因为我不干了
Because I'm done.

131
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,870
你是指授课  还是丢脸
Teaching or being humiliated?

132
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,390
两者都是  我不知道你为什么觉得
Both! I don't know why you ever thought

133
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,870
我可以教他们
I could teach that class.

134
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,280
我知道你不行
Oh, I knew you couldn't.

135
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,700
什么  你故意让我失败  为什么
What? You set me up to fail? Why?

136
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,620
如果你只做力所能及的事
If you only do what you can do,

137
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,600
就永远无法更进一步
you will never be more than you are now.

138
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,630
我不想更进一步  我喜欢自己
I don't wanna be more! I like who I am.

139
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,290
你连自己是谁都不知道
You don't even know who you are.

140
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,730
你说什么...  我当然知道
What do you...? Of course I do.

141
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,590
我是神龙大侠
I'm the Dragon Warrior.

142
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,010
而神龙大侠究竟意味着什么呢
And what exactly does that mean, Dragon Warrior?

143
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,090
这意味着  四处闯荡
It means, you know, just going around

144
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,670
挥拳踢脚
and punching and kicking.

145
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,360
守卫山谷  这一类的
Defending the valley! And stuff.

146
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,120
挥拳踢脚
Punching and kicking?

147
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,010
你以为这就是乌龟大师选中你的原因吗
You think that is what the great Master Oogway saw for you?

148
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,310
五百年前的预言应验了
A 500-year prophecy fulfilled

149
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,190
难道就是为了让你耍耍拳脚
so you could spend your days kicking butt...

150
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,470
成天在镇上招摇过市吗
and running through town high-fiving bunnies?

151
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,510
-是的  -错了
- Yes? - No!

152
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,700
乌龟看到了你的巨大潜力  阿宝
Oogway saw greatness in you, Po.

153
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,630
尽管我不敢苟同
Against my better judgment.

154
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,550
他对你寄以厚望
More than you can see in yourself.

155
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,860
惊人的力量在等着你
Incredible power awaits you.

156
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:18,800
超乎你想象的力量
Power beyond anything you can imagine.

157
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,690
那是什么
What was that?

158
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,450
这是气
That was chi.

159
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,010
气是什么
What's chi?

160
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,890
生物筋骨中流淌的能量
The energy that flows through all living things.

161
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,950
你的意思是如果我授课
So you're saying if I teach,

162
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,360
就能练刚才那炫酷的神功吗
I'll be able to do cool stuff like that?

163
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,520
不  我是说如果你授课的话
No. I'm saying if you teach,

164
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,120
我就有时间练这炫酷的神功了
I'll be able to do cool stuff like that.

165
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,420
想要掌握气  首先要控制自己
Mastering chi requires mastery of self.

166
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,270
乌龟曾在洞穴里
Oogway sat alone in a cave

167
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:04,150
枯坐三十年  思考一个问题
for 30 years asking one question.

168
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,390
我是谁
"Who am I?"

169
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,630
我是谁
"Who am I?"

170
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,980
我能有五分钟不被你打扰就不错了
I'm lucky if I get five minutes before you interrupt...

171
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,980
那现在我要在洞穴里枯坐三十年
So now I have to sit alone in a cave for 30 years?

172
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,830
总归是要的
Eventually.

173
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,770
在你能够熟练授课之后
After you master teaching.

174
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,040
授课  我没法像你那样授课的
Teaching? There's no way I'm ever gonna be like you.

175
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,150
我不是要把你变成我
I'm not trying to turn you into me.

176
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,560
而是要把你  变成你
I'm trying to turn you into you.

177
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,450
把我变成我自己
Turn me into me?

178
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,840
等等  这说不通...
Wait a second, that makes no...

179
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,910
成功就在眼前  师父
Almost there, Shifu.

180
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,680
说话再难懂一点  你就是下一个乌龟了
Just a little more confusing and you'll be the next Oogway.

181
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,680
抱歉  无意冒犯
Sorry, no offense,

182
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,220
乌龟大师  我只是...
Master Oogway. I just...

183
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,370
我还是不打扰你了
I'll let you get back to your eternal peace.

184
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,450
这是什么地方
What is this place?

185
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,490
我兄弟的农场
My brother's farm?

186
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,090
如果我踩到了你  你会不会死
If I stepped on you, would you die?

187
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,490
会的
Yes.

188
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,820
凡界
The mortal realm.

189
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,810
你听到了吗  乌龟  我回来了
You hear that, Oogway? I'm back.

190
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,710
天煞回来了
Kai has returned!

191
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,010
谁
Who?

192
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,040
天煞  天煞将军
Kai. General Kai.

193
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:56,050
中国的至上战神
Supreme warlord of all China.

194
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:01,350
碧玉屠夫  痛苦之源
The Jade slayer. Master of pain.

195
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,340
你们可能听说过我复仇凶兽的名头
You may know me as the Beast of Vengeance.

196
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,600
寡妇制造者
Maker of Widows?

197
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,960
好吧  我曾和乌龟并肩战斗
Okay, I used to work with Oogway.

198
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,870
乌龟大师
Oh, Master Oogway!

199
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,840
他是个伟大的战士
Now, he was a great warrior.

200
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,190
我们听说过乌龟大师
We've heard of Master Oogway.

201
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,930
好了  好了  够了  安静
Okay, okay, enough. Silence!

202
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,470
找到乌龟的徒弟  把他们带来见我
Find Oogway's students, and bring them to me.

203
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,140
等我收拾完他们  乌龟
By the time I am done with them, Oogway...

204
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:43,130
再不会有人记得你的名字
There will be no one left who will even remember your name.

205
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,710
天煞来了
Kai is coming!

206
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,020
我准备好
I am ready...

207
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,750
给你们上一课
to teach you a lesson.

208
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,140
教我  天啊  是神龙老师
Teach me? Oh, no! It's the Dragon teacher!

209
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,750
他真帅
Yeah, he's so handsome!

210
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,230
谢谢夸奖
Thank you for the compliment.

211
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,140
别  拜托不要把我教死了
No! Please don't teach me to death!

212
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,140
阿宝
Po?

213
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,210
爸爸  什么事
Oh, hey, dad. What's up?

214
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,870
我只是过来泡个澡
I was just, uh... stopping by for a little soak.

215
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,480
好了  怎么回事
Okay. What's wrong?

216
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,300
没事
Nothing.

217
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:23,070
没事  我回家看到你拿着娃娃泡澡
Nothing? I come home to find you taking a bath with your dolls...

218
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:23,890
是手办
Action figures.

219
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,860
而且你撒的不是浴盐
...and instead of adding bath salts to the water,

220
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,970
是四川花椒
you just added szechuan peppercorns.

221
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:28,950
四川...
Szechuan...

222
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,590
我的小嫩肉
Oh, oh, my tenders! Oh...

223
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,350
好吧  的确有事
Okay, yes, something's wrong.

224
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,450
没事  没事  儿子
There, there, son.

225
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,520
和爸爸好好说说
You tell your daddy all about it.

226
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,780
把胳膊抬起来
Lift your arm.

227
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,410
师父说我不知道
Shifu says I don't know what it means

228
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,930
当神龙大侠意味着什么
to be the Dragon Warrior.

229
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,890
现在我又要当老师
Now I have to be a teacher?

230
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,000
我以为我终于知道了自己是谁
I thought I finally knew who I was.

231
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,260
但如果我不是神龙大侠  我是谁呢
If I'm not the Dragon Warrior, who am I?

232
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,600
老师  教功夫吗
A teacher? Teaching kung fu?

233
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,250
阿宝  这可是升职了
Po, that's a promotion!

234
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,220
答应下来  儿子
Take the job, son!

235
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,120
将来等你掌管了翡翠宫
And, someday when you're in charge of the whole Jade palace...

236
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,570
我就能在大堂里卖面条了
I can sell noodles in the lobby!

237
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,670
你为什么还在这里像小孩一样洗澡
Why are you still here taking a bath like a baby?

238
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,730
出来  起来
Get out! Get up!

239
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,130
走走走  扩张分店就在眼前
Go, go, go! Franchise expansion awaits us!

240
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,020
神龙大侠模仿大赛怎么办
But what about the Dragon Warrior look-alike contest?

241
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,230
周太太总是能赢
Oh, Mrs. Chow always wins that.

242
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,430
接招吧
Skadoosh.

243
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,250
神龙大侠吃包子大赛呢
And the Dragon Warrior dumpling-eating contest?

244
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,680
我得捍卫我的荣誉
I have to defend my title.

245
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,290
没人能打破你的吃包子纪录
No one's gonna beat your dumpling-eating record.

246
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,450
有人要打破你的吃包子纪录了
Someone's about to beat your dumpling-eating record!

247
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,460
加油  加油
Go! Go!

248
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,930
谁在吃我的包子
Who's eating my dumplings?

249
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,520
谁来付钱
And who's paying for them?

250
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,940
101! 102!

251
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,580
103!

252
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,490
成功
Yeah!

253
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,080
这是新纪录吗
Is that a new record?

254
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,130
你是谁
Who are you?

255
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,080
我是李山
I am Li Shan.

256
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:55,930
什么
What?

257
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,380
我是李山
I'm Li Shan.

258
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,060
我来找我的儿子
I'm looking for my son.

259
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,360
你儿子不见了吗
You lost your son?

260
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,080
是的
Yes.

261
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,990
很多年前
Many years ago.

262
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,070
我也跟父亲失散了
I lost my father.

263
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:15,960
我非常遗憾
I'm very sorry.

264
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:17,300
谢谢
Thank you.

265
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,100
祝你好运
Well, good luck to you.

266
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,540
你也是
You, too.

267
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,690
希望你早日找到儿子
I hope you find your son.

268
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,970
希望你早日找到父亲
And I hope you find your father.

269
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,050
儿子
Son?

270
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,010
天啊  就是你
Oh, my gosh, it is you!

271
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,870
别傻站着了  来抱抱爸爸
Well, don't just stand there. Give your old man a hug!

272
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,440
不敢相信你还活着
I can't believe you're alive!

273
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,160
我以为我永远失去你了  小莲花
Oh, I thought I lost you forever, little Lotus.

274
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,930
好了  这很尴尬
Okay. Uh, this is very embarrassing...

275
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,410
你把我和一个叫莲花的熊猫搞混了
but I think you've got me confused with a panda named Lotus.

276
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,510
我的名字是阿宝
My name is Po.

277
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:10,050
对  你不知道的
Oh, right, you wouldn't know.

278
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,790
好吧  小莲花
Okay. See, little Lotus

279
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,080
是你出生时给你取的名字
was the name you were given at birth.

280
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,460
-真的吗  -真的
- Really? - Really!

281
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:16,550
真不敢相信
I can't believe it!

282
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,550
这么多年过去了  居然还能再见到你
After all these years, you're really here?

283
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,880
太好了
This is amazing!

284
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,320
爸爸
Oh, Dad!

285
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,030
来  来打声招呼
Come! Say hi to, um...

286
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,240
我不知道该怎么称呼你
I don't know what I'm supposed to call you.

287
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,230
我想他说他姓李

291
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,960
悉心照料我的儿子
for taking such good care of my son.

292
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,990
你的儿子  等一下
Your son? Now, hold on just a minute.

293
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:44,260
我们怎么知道这陌生人真和你有血缘关系
How do we know this stranger is even related to you?

294
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,610
你看看
Look at that.

295
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,170
-我们的肚子都这么像  -这太棒了
- Our bellies could be brothers! - That is so cool.

296

感觉就像是在照镜子
It's like looking in a fat mirror.

299
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,490
不敢相信我们在一起画像
I can't believe we're taking a picture together.

300
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,310
但我还是不能理解
But I still don't understand.

301
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,670
我以为阿宝是唯一一只熊猫了
I thought Po was the only panda left.

302
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,920
不是  有很多熊猫的
No. There's a whole bunch of us.

303
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,740
在哪
Where?

304

山里有个秘密的熊猫村

但你怎么知道我在哪

我收到了一条消息  它指引我来的
I received a message that led me here.

308
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,540
既然没人能找到你们
How could you receive a message

309
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,840
你是怎么收到消息的
if no one could find you?

310
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,740
我觉得很可疑
Sounds suspicious to me.

311
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,370
不  是上天传来的消息
No, it was a message from the universe.

312
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,440
该死
Rats!

313
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:38,950
这个神龙大侠是怎么一回事
Now, what's all this about a Dragon Warrior?

314
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,810
你怎么知道我是神龙大侠
How did you know I was a Dragon Warrior?

315
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,580
这也是上天告诉你的吗
Did the universe tell you that, too?

316
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,210
不  是海报上写的
No, the poster did.

317
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,330
还有礼品店
And the gift shop.

318
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,760
我买了个小杯子
I bought a tiny cup.

319

- Couple more steps. - Give me a minute.

325
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,090
感受肌肉酸痛
Feeling the burn.

326
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,760
你也有熊猫哮喘吗
Do you have panda asthma, too?

327
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,540
是家族遗传的吗
Does that run in the family?

328
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,370
爸爸  你会很爱这个的

你是想说太棒了吗  这里就是棒
You were gonna say "Awesome," right? Because it totally is!

335
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,010
-绝对的  -但千万要小心点
- Totally! - But be super careful.

336
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,540
这里可都是易碎品
Everything's very fragile here.

337
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,430
比如这个轻语武士瓮

以前就有人打碎过

Get out of my head, dad! I've wondered the same thing!

343
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,760
想我能不能穿得下吗
If I could fit in it?

344
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,490
想你干嘛  想我能不能穿得下

Do the hinges hinge? Does it smell like Rhino?

361
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,380
有没有一种固若金汤的感觉
Does it feel like you're impenetrable?

362

是不是觉得自己能击溃千军

00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,360
儿子  什么情况
Son? Under attack?

425
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,370
这简直太棒了
This is perfect!

426
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,280
现在你就知道
Now you can see what being

427
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,320
神龙大侠到底是干什么的了
the Dragon Warrior's all about!

428
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,820
跟我来
Follow me!

429
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,240
正义之敌  准备接招吧
Enemies of justice, prepare for war!

430
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,660
这是在逗我吗
Are you kidding me?

431
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,540
这些绿绿的是什么东西
What's the deal with the green guys?

432
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,540
某种玉僵尸吧
Some kind of Jade zombies.

433
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,470
玉僵尸
Jade zombies?

434
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,610
玉尸  呸呸呸
Jombies! Jinx!

435
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,200
莲花  小心啊
Lotus, be careful!

436
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,440
没事的  爸爸  这是家常便饭
It's okay, dad, I do this every day!

437
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,820
我认识这些家伙
I recognize these guys.

438
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,400
他们是獾兄獾弟
The Master Badger twins,

439
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,150
绝招是双棍齐下
with their crushing double-gong technique!

440
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,800
对  就是这个
Yeah, that's the one!

441
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,000
而那个家伙是
And that guy is...

442
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,400
不会吧  是豪猪大师
No! Master Porcupine!

443
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,290
我以为他一百年前就死了呢
I thought he died a hundred years ago.

444
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,110
这些人都是传说啊
These guys are legend!

445
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:16,270
快给我们来张速写
Get a quick sketch of us.

446
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,190
画到了吗  你画到了吗
Did you get it? Did you get it?

447
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,000
我竟然闭眼了
Oh, I blinked.

448
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,510
能再来一张吗
Can we get another one?

449
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,150
我被豪猪大师掐脖子了
I'm being choked by Master Porcupine.

450
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:34,880
真是太帅了
This is so cool.

451
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,540
看  这不就是你吗
Oh, look. It's you!

452
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,280
阿宝  集中精神
Po, focus!

453
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,360
"来自上天的消息"
"Message from the universe."

454
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,020
我给你条来自上天的消息
I'll give you a message from the universe.

455
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,450
离我儿子远点
Stay away from my son!

456
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,120
抱歉  爸爸  我等下会收拾干净的
Sorry, dad. I'll clean up later.

457
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,390
别用好锅
Not my good pan!

458
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,510
要不拿这个吧
Uh, take this one.

459
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,650
莲花  当心
Lotus! Watch out!

460
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,510
爸爸  让你见识一下我的包子连环炮
Dad, check out my dumplings of doom.

461
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,920
抓住你们了
Gotcha.

462
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,150
我看到你了
I see you.

463
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,910
你的气很快就会归我所有了
Your chi will soon be mine.

464
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:24,490
-他是在跟我说话吗  -你说哪个
- Is he talking to me? - Which one?

465
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,770
他们都在说话
They're all talking.

466
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:28,210
对哦  还真是  好吓人
Whoa, you're right. That's so scary.

467
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,870
要不咱们也试试  吓回去
We should try that, too. Maybe it'd be scary back at them.

468
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,540
可以  但我们得先想想要说啥
Okay, but we gotta plan what we're gonna say first.

469
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,360
不然的话就不是吓人  而是蠢了
Otherwise, it won't be scary. It'll just be stupid.

470
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,350
不是他们在跟你说话  白痴
It's not them talking, you idiots!

471
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,400
是我在借他们说话  我是天煞
It's me talking through them. Kai!

472
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,480
谁
Who?

473
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,340
好了好了  够了
Okay, okay, okay. Enough.

474
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,120
-你看到了吗  -发生什么事了
- Did you see that? - What just happened?

475
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,300
绿色的烟  噗地一下就消失了
The green smoke, just poof! And then poof!

476
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,450
师父  那是什么
Shifu, what was that?

477
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,240
天煞  天煞  天煞...
Kai... Kai... Kai...

478
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,270
不知道  没听说过
Nope, never heard of him.

479
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,860
天煞 天煞...
Kai... Kai...

480
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:01,700
在哪里
Where is it?

481
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,310
这里卷宗太多了  我什么都找不到
There's so much wisdom in here, I can't find anything.

482
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,560
找到了
Yes!

483
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,860
看仔细了
Behold.

484
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,690
所有的答案都在这里了
All the answers will be found within.

485
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,230
什么  竟然是空的
What? It's blank?

486
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:19,750
开什么玩笑  又来
Are you kidding me? Not again.

487
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,480
等等  等一下  不好意思
Wait, wait, hold on. Sorry.

488
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,610
好了  有了
Oh, okay. Here we go.

489
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,900
这是乌龟的笔迹
It is written in Oogway's hand.

490
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,730
"很久之前  我有个兄弟"
"Long ago, I had a brother..."

491
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:33,650
乌龟竟然有兄弟
Oogway had a brother?

492
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:37,360
结拜的  抱歉  忘了说是结拜兄弟
"In arms. In arms." Sorry. He says, "Brother-in-arms."

493
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,850
你要不一次性都打开看看吧
Maybe you should just unroll it all at once?

494
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:44,290
"我曾是个统领千军壮志凌云的年轻战士
"I was an ambitious young warrior leading a great army."

495
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:49,200
同我并肩作战的  是天煞
And fighting by my side was Kai...

496
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,350
我的挚友
my closest friend.

497
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:58,010
某天  我们遭遇埋伏
One day, we were ambushed.

498
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,800
我身受重伤
I was badly wounded.

499
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,880
我的朋友背着我走了几天  寻求帮助
My friend carried me for days, looking for help...

500
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,690
直到我们来到个隐于群山之上的
until we came to a secret village...

501
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,520
秘密的村庄
high in the mountains.

502
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,730
一个古老的医庄
An ancient place of healing.

503
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,100
熊猫村
A village of pandas.

504
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,480
熊猫吗
Pandas?

505
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,740
是的  熊猫
Yes, pandas.

506
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:24,110
熊猫借气的力量治好了我的伤
Pandas who used the power of chi to heal me.

507
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,290
还教会我如何运气
They taught me how to give chi.

508
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,090
但天煞想把这种力量
Oh, but Kai wanted the power

509
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,630
据为己有
all to himself.

510
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,820
他发现气可以给予  也可以被夺走
He saw that what could be given could also be taken.

511
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,160
我必须阻止他
I had to stop him.

512
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,570
我们打得地动天摇
Our battle shook the earth...

513
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,610
直到最后
Until, finally...

514
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:03,810
我将天煞逐入灵界
I banished Kai to the spirit realm.

515
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,860
若他重返凡界
Should he ever return to the mortal realm...

516
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:11,200
只有真正的气功大师才能阻止他
He can only be stopped by a true master of chi.

517
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,180
"真正的气功大师"
"True master of chi"?

518
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,020
像你这样的吗
Like you!

519
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:16,450
我  我连让花绽放都勉强
Me? I can barely make a flower bloom.

520
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:19,110
我至少还需要三十年时间  再加一个洞
I need at least 30 more years, and a cave.

521
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,380
我们需要一个气功大师
We need a chi master.

522
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,460
他会不断夺取大师们的气
He will continue stealing

523
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,280
直到世上再没有气
the chi of masters until he has consumed it all.

524
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,000
我们得想个办法阻止他
We have to think of a way to stop him!

525
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,760
他每打败一位大师
He'll get more and more powerful

526
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,330
就会变强几分
with every master he defeats.

527
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,210
别无他法  我们要战斗
There is no choice. We fight.

528
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,370
我可以教你  儿子
I can teach you, son.

529
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,780
你可以吗
You can do this?

530
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,070
当然  我可是熊猫
Of course. I'm a panda.

531
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,150
这一定就是上天派你来的原因
That must be why the universe sent you here!

532
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,280
好的  那我需要做些什么
Okay, so what do I have to do?

533
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,770
你得和我一起回家
You have to come home with me.

534
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,730
什么
What?

535
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,390
去神秘村庄吗
To the secret village?

536
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,320
是的  儿子
Yes, son.

537
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,550
你必须重新认识做熊猫的真谛
You must rediscover what it is to be a panda.

538
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,540
你得学着像熊猫一样生活
You have to learn to live like a panda,

539
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,110
像熊猫一样睡觉
sleep like a panda...

540
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:59,510
像熊猫一样吃饭
Eat like a panda.

541
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,850
那103个包子
Those 103 dumplings?

542
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:04,650
我只是热个身罢了
I was just warming up.

543
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,760
我一直觉得我没有完全发掘出吃的潜力
I've always felt like I wasn't eating up to my full potential.

544
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,300
不  你不能把阿宝带走  不  不行
No, you can't take Po away from me. No, no.

545
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,280
我希望能再多个选项
I want a second opinion.

546
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,160
师父  再开一个卷轴看看
Shifu, open another scroll or something.

547
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,890
我觉得他应该去
I think he should go.

548
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:18,520
好的  那再换一个
Fine, a third opinion.

549
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:21,130
金猴  灵蛇  悍娇虎
Monkey? Viper? Tigress?

550
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,580
爸爸  你听到师父说乌龟是怎么说的了
Dad, you heard what Shifu said Oogway said.

551
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,670
只有气功大师才能阻止这家伙
This guy can only be stopped by a master of chi.

552
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,680
只有明白了我是谁  才有可能掌握气功
And I can only master chi by knowing who I really am.

553
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,570
而且  我确实是只熊猫
Well, I'm a panda.

554
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,830
我去给你准备路上吃的干粮
I'll pack you a lunch for the road.

555
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,380
你真的觉得阿宝能及时掌握气功吗
Do you really think Po can master chi in time?

556
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,710
我怎么想不重要
Doesn't matter what I think.

557
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:52,190
关键是上天怎么想
It only matters what the universe thinks.

558
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,810
所以是不能的意思吗
So, that's a "No"?

559
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,990
大师  我们要怎么做
Master, what are we going to do?

560
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,050
你去查明天煞的下落
You are going to find out where Kai is.

561
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:00,080
跟着那些玉怪兽的踪迹
Follow the trail of those Jade creatures.

562
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,250
但不要同它们交战
But do not engage...

563
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:04,950
天煞每经过一次较量  就会变强几分
For with every foe he faces, Kai becomes stronger.

564
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:07,550
为什么是我  因为我多嘴问了吗
Why me? Is it because I asked?

565
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:10,270
不  是因为你会飞  出发吧
No. It is because you can fly. Go!

566
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,510
真应该闭上你的鸟嘴
Should have kept your beak shut.

567
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,750
带上螳螂
And take Mantis.

568
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,810
是因为我...
Oh, man. Is it because I...?

569
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:16,460
是的
Yes.

570
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:44,780
午饭时间
Lunch break.

571
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,380
求之不得
You don't need to ask me twice.

572
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:48,760
爸爸
Dad?

573
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,860
-怎么了  -爸爸
- Yes? - Dad?

574
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,030
怎么了
Yes?

575
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,410
你在这里干什么
What are you doing here?

576
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:56,150
我在干什么  有点背痛
What am I doing? Getting a backache.

577
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:58,380
你是每块石头都要踩吗
Did you have to step on every rock?

578
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,930
不是  我是说  你为什么会在这里
No, I mean, why are you here?

579
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,670
那我要怎么办
What was I supposed to do, huh?

580
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:04,160
万一你不爱吃熊猫做的菜怎么办
What if the pandas don't have food you like?

581
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,720
饿着肚子是不可能拯救世界的
You're never gonna be able to save the world on an empty stomach.

582
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,610
我认为我非常有必要在场
I consider my presence mission critical.

583
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,230
是的  关于这点
Oh... yes, about that...

584
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:16,120
我们不能告诉别人村庄的地点  所以
We can't share the location of the village with others. So...

585
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,020
你是觉得我不能保守秘密咯
Well, you think I can't keep a secret, huh?

586
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,150
我养了阿宝二十年
I raised Po for 20 years

587
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,580
才告诉他不是我亲生的
before I finally told him he was adopted.

588
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,290
-真的吗  -当然
- Seriously? - Yeah.

589
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:28,600
好吧  那让你再飞回去真是太残忍了
Okay. I guess it would be cruel to make you fly back.

590
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,610
你竟然会飞
You can fly?

591
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:33,430
我好歹也是鸟  阿宝
I'm a bird, Po.

592
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,470
我们到了
We're here.

593
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,140
看着还有好远啊
Sure looks like a long ways up there.

594
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,890
而且我儿子讨厌爬楼梯
And my son hates stairs.

595
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,840
所以  咱还是回家吧
So, let's go home.

596
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,590
我们是熊猫  我们不爬楼梯的
We're pandas. We don't do stairs.

597
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,400
等了一辈子  终于等到这句话了
I've waited my whole life to hear those words.

598
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,460
该死
Rats.

599
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,810
这就是神秘的熊猫村吗
This is the secret panda village?

600
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,180
难怪你不想让人家知道
No wonder you keep it a secret.

601
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:43,240
要我住这儿  我也不好意思告诉别人
If I lived here, I wouldn't tell anyone either.

602
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,580
现在你可以喊哇了
Now you can "Whoa."

603
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,590
哇
Whoa!

604
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:55,100
-走吧  -这里  快来
- Let's go! - Over here! Come on!

605
00:32:58,630 --> 00:32:59,810
看那里
Look over there!

606
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:24,650
到我了  到我了  过来  快点
My turn! My turn! Come on, faster, faster!

607
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,640
李
Li?

608
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,490
各位  李回来了
Everyone! Li's back!

609
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,960
-他俩都回来了  -他找到他儿子了
- They're both back! - He found his son!

610
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,860

611
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,360
-李  -他找到他儿子了
- Li? - He found his son!

612
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,390
各位  李回来了
Everyone! Li's back!

613
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,080
别急  我们来了
Hang on, we're coming!

614
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,850
他成功了
He made it!

615
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:42,360
-他们成功了  -我们为什么要跑
- They made it! - Why are we running?

616
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,780
他们成功了
They made it!

617
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,710
李山回来了
Li Shan is back!

618
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,190
各位
Everyone!

619
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,460
各位  都过来  这是我儿子
Everyone, gather around! This is my son!

620
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,180
-你好  你好  -他来了
- Hello, hi. - He's here!

621
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,770
-你来了  -三胞胎
- You're here! - Triplets!

622
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:07,130
你好  我是酷酷
Hi, I'm Ku Ku!

623
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,300
-我是萌萌  -我是帅帅
- I'm Meng Meng. - I'm Shuai Shuai.

624
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,400
-你的毛真软  -他闻起来像曲奇一样
- Your fur is soft. - He smells like cookies.

625
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:14,280
他好帅啊  跟他爹一样帅
He's so handsome, just like his father.

626
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,350
谢谢
Thank you.

627
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,470
儿子  这是你的表兄弟
Son, these are your cousins.

628
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:18,540
阿点和阿心
Dim and Sum.

629
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,710
我还有表兄弟
I have cousins!

630
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,400
-欢迎  -欢迎
- Welcome! - Welcome!

631
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,240
包子串一绳
Buns on a string.

632
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,130
我们叫它小食链
We call it a snacklace.

633
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,310
是嘛
That's right.

634
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,630
我们再给你做一条
We'll make you another one.

635
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,790
真的是你
It's you!

636
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:32,760
-真好  -你好
- So...That's nice. - Yeah, hi!

637
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,580
我不知道你是谁
I don't know who you are.

638
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,750
花娃娃  真好看
Oh, stripy baby. So beautiful.

639
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:41,040
好  小心点  这可是我的手办
Okay, careful with that. That's my action figure.

640
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,620
-我能留着吗  行吗  -不行...
- Can I keep her? Can I? - No...

641
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,710
才怪  当然可以了
...problem. Of course.

642
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,760
是啊  所以我才买下它
Yeah. That's why I brought her.

643
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,780
照顾好它
Take good care of her.

644
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,710
太棒了  花娃娃
Yes! Stripy baby.

645
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,790
你长得跟我好像  不过是小号的
You look just like me, but a baby.

646
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:00,580
你也跟我很像  不过老了点
You're like me, but old.

647
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:03,700
你也跟我很像  不过胖了点
You're like me, but fatter!

648
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,720
你也跟我很像  不过
You're like me, but...

649
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,370
多了顶帽子
...with a hat.

650
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,340
他是戴着帽子
He does wear a hat!

651
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:13,060
你们都跟我很像
You all look like me.

652
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:17,460
庆祝吾儿归来  我们尽情吃吧
Let's feast in my son's honor.

653
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,220
这是什么...
What the...?

654
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:23,700
熊猫是不走路的  我们靠滚的
Pandas don't walk. We roll!

655
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,920
你见过这么滑稽的人吗
Have you ever seen anyone look so ridiculous?

656
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,300
阿宝  你在干嘛  阿宝
Po, what are you doing? Po!

657
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,310
你说得对  这比走路好多了
You're right, that is better than walking.

658
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,440
真是好菜
Yeah, that's the good stuff.

659
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,390
吃点包子吧
Have some dumplings.

660
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:00,030
怎么会有熊猫不会滚
What kind of panda doesn't know how to roll?

661
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,720
我对做熊猫这事还真有点陌生
Well, I'm kind of new at this whole "Being a panda" Thing.

662
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:03,830
那你算哪门子熊猫
Hey, what kind of panda are you?

663
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,840
你的脖子真喜感
You have a funny neck.

664
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,620
我根本不是熊猫
I'm not a panda at all.

665
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,530
-那是什么  -我的帽子
- What's that? - My hat.

666
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,250
-那是什么  -我的嘴
- What's that? - My beak.

667
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:08,950
-那个呢  -我的翅膀
- What's that? - My wing.

668
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,440
-那个呢  -我的包子
- What's that? - My dumplings.

669
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,300
别再问了  走开  小屁孩
No more questions! Go away, kid.

670
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:15,250
给  儿子  我给你带了筷子
Here, son. I packed your chopsticks.

671
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:15,770
-谢了  老爸  -哇
- Thanks, Dad. - Wow.

672
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:18,330
-天呐  -怎么了
- Oh, my. - What?

673
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,260
那是用来干什么的
What are those for?

674
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:20,990
这个吗  这是筷子
These? These are chopsticks.

675
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:22,230
是用来夹包子的
They're for picking up dumplings.

676
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:25,290
你是说你是一个一个地吃包子吗
You mean you only eat one at a time?

677
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,500
-好吃  -是啊  真好吃
- Yummy. - Yeah, yummy.

678
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,130
我就知道我没有完全发掘出吃东西的潜力
I knew I wasn't eating up to my potential!

679
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,310
我是美美
I am Mei Mei.

680
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,720
她太美了  真是貌美如花
Wow, she's amazing. She's so beautiful.

681
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,370
嘴真甜  阿宝
That's sweet, Po.

682
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:59,140
不过好听的话尽量留点
But please, try to save all other compliments

683
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,640
等到表演结束后再夸奖我
until after the performance.

684
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,920
我  不  我没说过...
Me? No, I didn't say...

685
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,180
别说了
Shut it.

686
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:08,330
表演完再夸
After the performance.

687
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:10,250
还没开始吗
Has it started yet?

688
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:16,480
她的彩带舞天下第一
Best ribbon dancer in the world!

689
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,400
至少她是这么说的
At least, that's what she said.

690
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,040
别看我  别看我
Look away. Look away.

691
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,510
不  你已经无法移开目光了  对吧
No. You can't, can you?

692
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:25,070
老爸  她为什么一直用那种眼神...
Dad, why does she keep staring at me like...

693
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:26,030
看着我
That!

694
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,320
试着跟上节奏
Try to keep up.

695
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,950
我真的不大会跳舞
I don't really know how to dance!

696
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:34,840
你当然会了  熊猫都会跳舞
Of course you do. All pandas dance.

697
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,480
我知道你在想什么
I know what you were thinking.

698
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:37,220
是吗
You do?

699
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:40,040
怎么会有这般美若天仙的熊猫
"How can one panda be so beautiful?"

700
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,350
给我的吗
For me? Oh!

701
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,370
阿宝
Po.

702
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,770
-帮帮我  老爸  -不了  靠自己
- Help me, dads. - Yeah, no, you're on your own.

703
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:51,780
跳得很好  儿子
You're doing great, son.

704
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,080
该你了
Your turn.

705
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,830
做得好  阿宝
Yay, po!

706
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:13,680
别担心  你会掌握要领的
Don't worry. You'll get the hang of it.

707
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,020
我有太多要学的了
I have so much to learn.

708
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,590
侦查之翼
Wings of surveillance!

709
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,510
-你为什么要说这种话  -说什么
- Why do you do that? - Do what?

710
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,270
你每次说话加上"之翼"的时候
Just because you say "wings of" before something,

711
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:33,030
你并没有在使什么招数
it doesn't mean that you're doing a special move.

712
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,340
就和我说"力量之须"一样
It's like me saying "antenna of power"

713
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,820
或者是"做三明治之胸"
or "thorax of making sandwiches".

714
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,650
反对之翼
Wings of disagreement.

715
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,640
看那里
There.

716
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:45,510
熊大师  公鸡大师  鳄鱼大师
Master Bear, Master Chicken, Master Croc!

717
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,800
你们在这干什么
What are you doing out here?

718
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,860
玉僵尸袭击了我们的村庄
Jade creatures attacked our villages.

719
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,960
我们追踪到了这里
We've tracked them here.

720
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,040
停
Stop!

721
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,450
他们一定在里面
They must be in there.

722
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:59,120
师父强烈建议我们...
Master Shifu strongly advised us...

723
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,030
不要同他们交战
not to engage.

724
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,620
-我们必须进去  -可师父说了...
- We've gotta get in there. - But Master Shifu said...

725
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:06,800
你是害怕了吗
You're seriously afraid?

726
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,100
连公鸡大师都进去了  他可是胆小鬼
Even Master Chicken's going in there! And he's a chicken.

727
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:20,340
我受够了  我要进去了
That's it. I'm going in.

728
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,880
螳螂  我们有命令在身...
Mantis! We have orders not to...

729
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,450
我们得帮他们
They need our help!

730
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,580
快来  我从上方进攻  你从下面
Come on. I'll go high, you go low.

731
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,650
不  等等
No, wait.

732
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,760
见识下你虫爷爷的厉害
Fear the bug!

733
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,690
好吧  你这个...
All right, you little...

734
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,180
坚持住  兄弟  我来了
Hold on, buddy. I'm coming!

735
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,460
力量之须  不管用
Antenna of power! Ah! It didn't work!

736
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,690
螳螂
Mantis!

737
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,410
螳螂
Mantis?

738
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,020
螳螂
Mantis.

739
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,570
你体内的气很强
Your chi is strong.

740
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,980
和你的朋友一样...
Just like your friend...

741
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,810
那只小虫子
The bug.

742
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:04,750
螳螂
Mantis.

743
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,940
别担心  小鸟
Don't worry, little birdie.

744
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,920
我会好好利用你的气的...
I'll put your chi to good use...

745
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:23,430
我将用它毁掉翡翠宫和那里的所有人
Destroying the Jade palace and everyone in it.

746
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:24,320
不
No!

747
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,560
懊悔之翼
Wings of regret!

748
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,430
好极了
Oh, yeah.

我会让你重新绽放
I'm gonna make you bloom.

752
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:51,300
老爸  老爸
Dad. Dad.

753
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,570
什么  怎么了  什么事

754
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:54,170
我已经准备好接受第一天的熊猫训练了
I'm ready for my first day of panda training.

755
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:55,810
-什么  -就是学做熊猫
- What? - You know, learn to be a panda,

756
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:57,420
掌握气功  拯救世界
master chi, save the world!

757
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:00,210
熊猫睡到午后才醒
Pandas sleep till past noon.

758
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:03,330
第一课就是  "回去睡觉"
So lesson number one is, "Go back to bed".

759
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,090
遵命
Of course!

760
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,880
肯定不会是件容易事
Nobody said this was gonna be easy.

761
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,020
我睡过头了吗
Did I oversleep?

762
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,510
绝对睡过了
You sure did.

763
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,320
太好了
Yes!

764

765
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,650
你会这样吗  会这样吗

这个会吗  那这样呢

767

我做的对吗  做的好不好
Am I doing it? Is this good?

768
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,820
我学会了
I got it! Ka-blam!

769
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,430
-熊猫奶奶  小心  -你们好  啊

771
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:36,600
阿宝  吃午饭了
Po, lunch time.

772
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:43,930
阿宝
Po?

773
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:47,200
你该顺着山坡自然的往下滚
You gotta let the hill tell you where to roll.

774
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,210
我还是不熟练
Rookie mistake.

775
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:51,800
阿点  阿心  让他看看我们怎么上山
Dim, Sum, let's show him how we go uphill!

776
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,920
太厉害了
It's beautiful.

777
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:57,180
-吃点心了  阿宝  -太爽了
- Snack time. Po! - Whoo-hoo!

778

你会飞了
You can fly?

779
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,060
全速前进
I'm coming in hot!

780
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,000
等凉了再吃吧
Get them while they're cold.

781
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,540
你们在干什么
What are you doing there?

782
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,240
这是给阿宝做的
That food is for Po!

783
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,520
扔进去
Throw it in!

784
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,240
来抱抱  就这样
There, there. That's it.

785
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,210
-感觉放松了吗  -是啊
- Feeling relaxed? - Totally.

786
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:20,620
只要顺其自然
Just let yourself fall into it.

787
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,550
知道了
Got it.

788
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,420
我没事  我只是...
I'm fine. I just...

789
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,550
好了  吐出来就好了
There we go. Just let it all out.

790
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,170
就这样
That's my boy.

791
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:35,030
从上面下来
Get out of there!

792
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,850
我的面条
My noodles!

793
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:40,430
别碰我的面条
Leave my noodles alone.

794
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:46,120
真淘气啊  阿宝  真够淘气的
Subtle, Po. Very subtle.

795
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,090
我也要抱抱
Let me get some of that.

796
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:51,420
别咬我的帽子
Hey, leave my hat alone!

797
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,160
我们爱吃面条
We love noodles!

798
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,290
还要面条
More noodles!

799
00:42:58,290 --> 00:42:59,970
就和阿宝一样
Just like my Po.

800
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:06,280
你们在看什么
What are you guys looking at?

801
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:15,880
我们就是这么滚的  开炮
That's how we roll! Cannonball!

802
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:19,350
好棒

00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,810
妈妈你看
Mom, look it! Whoa!

805
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,130
我做得怎么样
How was that?

806
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:48,150
你再试一次  不过别太用力
Now, you try again. But don't try so hard.

807
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:49,450
好的  好的
Okay. Okay.

808
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:56,890
好多了
Much better.

809
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:05,750
谢谢了  老爸
Thanks, Dad.

810
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:07,170
谢我什么
For what?

811
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,340
你知道  就是为了
You know, just for, you know,

812
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,210
教我怎么去过...
showing me what it feels like...

813
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,300
熊猫的生活
To be a panda.

814
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,320
所以呢  你觉得我什么时候能准备好了
So, when do you think I'll be ready?

815
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:17,840
准备什么
Ready?

816
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,120
学怎么掌握气功
You know, to learn how to master chi.

817
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,110
很快就好了  很快
Soon. Real soon.

818
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:25,330
跟我来  我想给你看样东西  来吧
Come on, I wanna show you something else. Come on.

819
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:32,500
这里有点乱  我这里不大有人来
Sorry about the mess. I don't usually get visitors.

820
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:45,750
这是我妈妈吗
Is this my Mom?

821
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:54,810
在你百日的时候画的
I had this done on your 100th day.

822
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,270
你妈妈抱着你的时候  你一直在乱动
Your Momma couldn't hold you still.

823
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,910
你差点就把画纸吃了
You nearly ate the paper.

824
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,240
是真的
It's true.

825
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:06,080
她什么样
What was she like?

826
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,020
她很完美
She was the total package.

827
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,170
聪明  美丽...
Smart, beautiful...

828
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:17,540
食量惊人
Tremendous appetite.

829
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,660
她是我一生的挚爱
She was the love of my life.

830
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:25,510
就在我以为我已经最幸运的时候...
And then, just when I thought I couldn't get any luckier...

831
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,180
你出生了  我的小莲花
along you came, my little lotus.

832
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,660
那时我真的拥有了一切
I really had it all.

833
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:39,190
直到我...
Until that one moment...

834
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,050
又失去了一切
when I lost everything.

835
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:25,340
老爸
Dad.

836
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:29,130
你再也不用担心失去我了
You don't have to worry about losing me ever again.

837
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,050
好吗
Okay?

838
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,540
我也要抱抱
Let me get some of that.

839
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:53,890
从东部来的消息
It's from the Eastern province!

840
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:58,940
蜥蜴大师  公牛大师  雄鹰大师
Master Lizard, Master Ox, Master Eagle.

841
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:00,450
所有人
All of them.

842
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:02,990
自海边直至这里的所有村庄...
In every village from the sea to here...

843
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,240
全中国的所有大师...

844
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:06,780
都消失了
has vanished.

845
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:08,510
他们可能都去参加聚会了
Maybe they are all at a party.

846
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:09,190
金猴
Monkey.

847
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:10,840
我也没接到邀请
I didn't get invited either.

848
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,080
是天煞夺走了他们的气
Kai has taken their chi.

849
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,540
只有我们能阻止他毁掉
We are all that stand between him...

850
00:47:15,610 --> 00:47:19,330
乌龟留给我们保管的书卷了
and the knowledge Oogway left in our care.

851
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,830
村民都疏散了吗
The villagers, evacuated?

852
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,080
疏散完毕了  师父
Done, Master.

853
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:25,410
-仙鹤和螳螂呢  -还是没有消息
- Crane, Mantis? - Still nothing.

854
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:27,110
等等  他们来了
Wait. It's them!

855
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:32,250
不
No!

856
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,550
天煞
Kai.

857
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,630
好极了
Nice.

858
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:55,880
都没多大本事
Very tacky.

859
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:59,360
你怎敢涉足这片土地
How dare you set foot on these grounds!

860
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,690
看看你们这些可悲的傻瓜
Look at you pathetic fools.

861
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:05,970
在伟大的乌龟脚下卑躬屈膝
Groveling at the feet of Oogway the magnificent.

862
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:08,360
你没有资格说他的名字
You are not fit to speak his name.

863
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,090
我没有资格吗  小猫咪
I am not fit, little kitten?

864
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,080
我曾同他并肩战斗
I fought by his side.

865
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,680
曾待他亲如手足
I loved him like a brother.

866
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:21,820
而他却背叛了我
And he betrayed me.

867
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:29,840
如今我要毁灭他所建成的一切
Now I will destroy everything he has created!

868
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:31,190
上
Go!

869
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:54,740
小猫咪这招滋味如何
How's that for a little kitten?

870
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:13,920
我不会让你毁掉乌龟的回忆
I will not let you destroy Oogway's memory.

871
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,740
为什么不行  他也毁了我的
Why not? He destroyed mine.

872
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:17,700
螳螂
Mantis.

873
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:20,200
是我  你的好兄弟
It is me, your bestie!

874
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:26,420
抱歉  悍娇虎
Sorry, Tigress!

875
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:28,490
对不起  对不起
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

876
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:30,290
对不起
Sorry!

877
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:45,090
师父
Shifu.

878
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:47,380
把他们带过来
Bring them to me.

879
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:58,430
不
No.

880
00:49:58,430 --> 00:49:59,340
你必须去警告阿宝
You must warn Po.

881
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:00,700
求你了  师父
Master, please.

882
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:13,120
让你见识一下气功真正的力量  兄弟
I will show you the true power of chi, brother.

883
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:15,970
不
No.

884
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:54,700
乌龟  原谅我
Oogway, forgive me.

885
00:50:55,870 --> 00:50:58,510
你说什么  乌龟
Hmm. What do you say, Oogway?

886
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,360
你原谅他吗
Do you forgive him?

887
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:03,920
你可以毁掉翡翠宫...
You may have destroyed the Jade palace...

888
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,540
但你永远不会得逞
But you will never succeed.

889
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:10,860
总会有人出来阻止你的
There will always be someone to stop you.

890
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:12,700
谁  那只熊猫吗
Who? The panda?

891
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,260
他体内的气很强
His chi is strong...

892
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:17,310
但还是不足与我为敌
But it won't be enough.

893
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:22,560
-他会和你一个下场  -不
- He will meet the same fate as you. - No.

894
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:26,720
那个村庄里的所有熊猫也一样
And so will every panda in that village.

895
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:33,600
好极了
Yes.

896
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,360
阿宝  我希望你已经准备好了
Po, I hope you're ready.

897
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:46,640
跳舞  小莲花  跳起来
Dance, lotus. Dance.

898
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:50,690
小伙子长得真帅
He's so handsome.

899
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:55,390
这才算是熊猫的抱抱
That's a panda hug!

900
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:02,680
阿宝
Po.

901
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,190
悍娇虎
Tigress?

902
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:44,740
她是谁
Who's she?

903
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,210
那是谁
Who is that?

904
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:50,430
大花娃娃
Big stripy baby!

905
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:52,190
你怎么来了
What are you doing here?

906
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:53,860
天煞袭击了山谷
Kai attacked the valley.

907
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:55,450
他已经得到了天下所有大师的气
He's taken every master in China,

908
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:57,210
包括师父和其他人
including Shifu and the others.

909
00:52:57,370 --> 00:52:59,940
都完了  阿宝  所有东西  所有人
It's all gone, Po. Everything. Everyone.

910
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:00,980
所有人
Everyone?

911
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:02,210
所有人
Everyone.

912
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:04,580
我的餐馆怎么样了
How's my restaurant?

913
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:07,130
等会再说吧
We'll talk later.

914
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:08,990
如今他已经在往这里来了
And now he's on his way here.

915
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:10,910
他是来找你的  阿宝
He's after you, Po.

916
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,930
他是来找所有的熊猫
He's after all pandas.

917
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:14,730
我们还有多少时间
How long do we have?

918
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:15,700
不多了
Not long.

919
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:18,040
快告诉我你已经掌握气功了
Please, tell me you've mastered chi.

920
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,420
-来  你抱着孩子  -老爸  老爸
- Here, take the baby. - Dad! Dad!

921
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:20,610
这个是谁家的
Okay, who belongs to this one?

922
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:22,770
你必须马上教我气功秘诀了
You need to teach me the secret chi technique now!

923
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:25,060
不  不行  你恐怕还没准备好
No, no, I'm afraid you need more time.

924
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:27,130
大家都去收拾东西  我来帮你吧
Everyone, go get your things! Let me help you with that.

925
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:29,210
我没有时间了  我必须现在就学
I don't have more time. I need to learn it now!

926
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:31,190
对不起  但你还没有准备好
Sorry, you're not ready.

927
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:32,840
所有东西都收拾好
Okay, pack everything!

928
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,070
-我已经准备好了  -还没有
- I am ready. - Not quite.

929
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:34,920
你这是什么意思
What are you talking about?

930
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,290
我已经一切都按你说的做了
I've done everything you've asked.

931
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:38,940
我已经会了打瞌睡  睡懒觉  睡吊床
I've mastered napping, sleeping in, hammocks,

932
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:39,890
泡热水澡
hot tubs.

933
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,800
我已经完全在像熊猫一样生活了
I am totally at one with my panda parts.

934
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,290
你为什么还不教我
Now why won't you show me?

935
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,030
因为我压根不会
Because I don't know it!

936
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:49,480
什么
You what?

937
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:52,030
我不会  明白了吗  没人会那个
I don't know it, okay? No one does.

938
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:52,970
熊猫过去可能会
Maybe we used to.

939
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:55,470
但已经失传了
But not anymore.

940
00:53:56,110 --> 00:53:57,000
你骗了我
You lied?

941
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,340
没有  我...
No, I...

942
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:01,180
是的
Yes.

943
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:03,800
为...为什么
Wh... why?

944
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,600
为了救你
To save your life!

945
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:09,140
我知道有耍着刀的疯子来追杀你
I find out some blade-swinging maniac is coming for you.

946
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:10,700
我还能怎么办
What am I supposed to do?

947
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:12,450
就放任不管吗
Just let that happen?

948
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:14,800
没错  我是神龙大侠
Yes! I'm the Dragon Warrior.

949
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,180
对付疯子就是我的职责所在
Facing maniacs, that's my job!

950
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:20,320
但是因为你  我丢下山谷不管
But because of you, I left the valley unprotected.

951
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,410
丢下我的朋友们
I left my friends unprotected!

952
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:23,520
现在他们都...
And now they're all...

953
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:25,330
他们都...
They're all...

954
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:27,330
你也会落得同样的下场
And you would have been, too.

955
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:30,700
我曾失去过你
I lost you once.

956
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:33,230
我不会再次失去你
I am not going to lose you again.

957
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:35,480
我不能
I can't.

958
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,250
你刚刚已经失去我了
You just did.

959
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:56,540
妈妈  抱着我
Mom! Pick me!

960
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:05,190
阿宝  我好担心你...
Po, I'm so worried for you...

961
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:07,930
我都没法为我自始至终都是对的而得意了
That I can't even enjoy being right about everything.

962
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:08,790
现在赶紧跑
Now run, run, run,

963
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:10,970
迈开你的小胖腿  能跑多快是多快
as fast as those chubby legs can go!

964
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:12,520
逃跑  已经无处可逃了
Run? There's nowhere to run.

965
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,460
那你要怎么办
But what are you going to do?

966
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:17,170
我要留下来  和那个混蛋决一死战
I'm gonna stay, and fight that monster.

967
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:18,900
阿宝  他或许是个混蛋
Po, he may be a monster,

968
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,810
但他毕竟还是你爸爸
but he's still your father.

969
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:22,900
不是他  是天煞
Not him. Kai!

970
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:24,330
不要
No!

971
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:10,010
你饿吗
Hungry?

972
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:12,360
不...不大饿
No, I... not really.

973
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:14,990
吃一个也行
Well, maybe just one.

974
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:20,030
你要知道  你不是唯一一个说谎的人
You know, you weren't the only one who was lying.

975
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,070
我不只是因为
I didn't really come along

976
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:25,180
担心阿宝饿肚子才跟过来的
because I was worried Po would go hungry.

977
00:56:25,310 --> 00:56:27,310
我是担心你
I was worried about you.

978
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:28,930
担心我会饿肚子吗
Worried that I'd go hungry?

979
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:29,800
不
No.

980
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,900
我担心你会把阿宝从我身边夺走
I was worried you'd steal Po from me.

981
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:33,710
什么
I'd what?

982
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:36,170
我知道  我想多了
I know. That was crazy.

983
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:40,630
但我意识到让你进入阿宝的生活
But I realize having you in Po's life

984
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:42,930
并非我的损失
doesn't mean less for me.

985
00:56:43,010 --> 00:56:45,330
而是阿宝的收获
It means more for Po.

986
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:50,640
他的生活中已经没有我的位置
Well, I'm not in his life.

987
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:52,300
他不再要我了
Not anymore.

988
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:54,680
你的儿子生你的气了
Your son got mad at you.

989
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,740
体会到当家长的难处了吧
Welcome to parenthood.

990
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:59,800
你不明白  我骗了他
You don't understand. I lied to him.

991
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:01,640
他永远不会原谅我
He'll never forgive me.

992
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:04,130
我骗了他二十年
I lied to him for 20 years.

993
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:06,580
他还以为自己是从蛋里孵出来的
He still thinks he came from an egg.

994
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:09,660
有些时候  我们会做错事
Sometimes, we do the wrong things

995
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:11,710
但都是出于好意
for the right reasons.

996
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:20,850
听着
Look.

997
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:22,250
他很受伤
He's hurt.

998
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:24,390
他很迷茫
He's confused.

999
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:27,410
而且还要拯救世界
And he still has to save the world.

1000
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:30,950
他需要我们
He needs both his dads.

1001
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:50,890
这么做没有用
This isn't going to work.

1002
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:52,020
一定会有用的
It has to.

1003
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:53,170
你没有想清楚
You're not thinking straight.

1004
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:54,750
-我有  -你没有
- I am! - You're not.

1005
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:55,460
-我有  -你没有
- I am! - No.

1006
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:56,820
-我真的有  -你没有
- Yes, I am. - No.

1007
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:59,200
我见过天煞
I've seen Kai.

1008
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:00,610
我见识过他的能耐
I've seen what he can do.

1009
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:03,060
但他没见识过我的能耐
But he hasn't seen what I can do.

1010
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,440
悟习铁指扣吗
The Wuxi finger hold?

1011
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:10,260
我最厉害的一招
It's my best move.

1012
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:11,400
我只需要找到天煞
I just have to get to Kai,

1013
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,060
抓住他的手指  然后出招
grab his finger and then skadoosh!

1014
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,710
他就回灵界了
Back to the Spirit Realm.

1015
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:16,640
他有一队玉战士
He has an army of Jade Warriors.

1016
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:18,250
它们所见之事都逃不过他的法眼
Everything they see, he sees.

1017
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:20,150
所以不可能偷偷接近他
So there's no sneaking up on him.

1018
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:21,790
你不可能靠他足够近
You will never get close enough.

1019
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:22,970
这会成功的
It's gonna work!

1020
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:27,790
只有气功大师才能阻止他
He can only be stopped by a master of Chi.

1021
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:30,200
你听上去就像师父  满口气气气
Oh, you sound just like Shifu with the, "Chi, Chi, Chi."

1022
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,050
这个气  那个气  气气气
"Chi this. Chi that." "Chi, Chi, Chi!"

1023
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,460
我不是气功大师
I'm not a master of Chi, okay?

1024
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:35,810
我不知道自己是否真是神龙大侠
I don't know if I'm the Dragon Warrior.

1025
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:37,560
我甚至不知道自己是不是只熊猫
I don't even know if I'm a panda!

1026
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,210
我不知道自己是谁
I don't know who I am!

1027
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:42,870
你说得对
You're right.

1028
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:45,330
我根本无法阻止他和他的手下
There's no way I can stop him and his army.

1029
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:51,980
除非你也有自己的军队
Unless you had an army of your own.

1030
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,300
你吗
You?

1031
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:58,440
不仅仅是我
Not just me.

1032
00:58:58,660 --> 00:58:59,570
是我们
Us.

1033
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:01,170
我们大家
All of us.

1034
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:14,820
经过这么多年  我终于找到了我的儿子
I finally found my son, after all these years.

1035
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,930
即使是世界末日也不可能
It's going to take a lot more than the end of the world...

1036
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:19,300
让我们分离
to keep us apart.

1037
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,410
但你们一点功夫都不懂
But you don't even know kung fu.

1038
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,550
那你就来教我们
Then you will teach us.

1039
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,490
什么  我教不了你们功夫
What? I can't teach you kung fu.

1040
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:28,340
我连悍娇虎都教不了
I couldn't even teach Tigress.

1041
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:31,180
而她本来就懂功夫
And she already knows kung fu!

1042
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:34,330
阿宝  我知道
Po, I know

1043
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:37,810
你现在不会信任我
I'm the last guy you wanna trust right now.

1044
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,500
但你得相信我
But you gotta believe me.

1045
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:41,240
我们可以做到
We can do this.

1046
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,490
我们可以学功夫
We can learn kung fu.

1047
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,260
我们可以像你一样
We can be just like you!

1048
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:48,440
你刚才说什么
What did you just say?

1049
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:51,010
-我们可以做到  -不是
- "We can do this"? - No!

1050
00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:52,750
-我们可以学功夫  -后面一句
- "We can learn kung fu"? - After that!

1051
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:54,680
我们可以像你一样
Uh... "We can be just like you"?

1052
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,090
-没错  -我们真可以吗
- Yes! - We can?

1053
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:58,070
不  你们做不到
No! You can't!

1054
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,030
但你们不需要像我一样
But you don't have to be!

1055
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:03,150
这才是师父的真意
That's what Shifu meant.

1056
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:04,910
我不需要把你们变成我
I don't have to turn you into me.

1057
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:06,960
而是要把你们变成你们
I have to turn you into you!

1058
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:09,090
这话说不通啊
That doesn't make any sense.

1059
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:10,520
我知道
I know!

1060
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,490
谢谢  爸爸们
Thanks, dads.

1061
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:14,390
不客气
You're welcome?

1062
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,970
我要做一件从未想过自己能做到的事
I'm gonna do something I never thought I'd be able to do.

1063
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:19,680
我要教功夫了
I'm gonna teach kung fu.

1064
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:23,910
各位  你们真正的强大在于
You guys, your real strength comes from

1065
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:25,410
成为最好的自我
being the best "You" You can be.

1066
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:26,700
所以  你们是谁
So who are you?

1067
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,120
你们擅长什么
What are you good at?

1068
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:29,640
你们喜欢什么
What do you love?

1069
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,620
是什么让你们独一无二
What makes you, "You"?

1070
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:36,690
对  好  好  再来
Yes, good. Good. Again.

1071
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,340
好  再来
Good. Again.

1072
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:43,540
好好好  再来
Good, good, good. Again.

1073
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,710
花娃娃  花娃娃
Stripy baby! Stripy baby!

1074
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:50,950
再快点  再快点  彩带绕起来
Faster, faster! Twirl those ribbons!

1075
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:52,510
你  抱住木桩
Hug that log, you!

1076
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:54,150
像是最后一次告别那样
Hug that log like it's the last time

1077
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,280
紧紧抱住它
you're ever gonna hug it goodbye forever.

1078
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:58,190
再高点  这次再往左一点
Higher! And a little more to the left this time.

1079
01:00:58,190 --> 01:00:59,380
你能行
You can do it!

1080
01:01:02,290 --> 01:01:04,730
我不想看到任何包子落地
I don't wanna see any of these hit the ground!

1081
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:17,900
等等  花娃娃
Wait, wait, stripy baby!

1082
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:20,850
好  用这个试试
Good! Try it with this.

1083
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,240
现在用这个试试
Now try it with these!

1084
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:31,530
好  再用这个试试
Good! Now try it with these.

1085
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:06,850
他们准备好了
They are ready.

1086
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:10,730
什么
What?

1087
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:15,330
大家注意  我只会再重复十遍
Okay, pay attention because I'm only gonna go over this ten more times.

1088
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:18,020
村子唯一的入口在这里
The only entrance to the village is here.

1089
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:20,610
包子小队在这里待命
The dumpling squadron will take position here...

1090
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:23,030
饼干小队在这里待命
While the cookie squadron will take position here.

1091
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:25,950
听我号令  这两支小队将...
Now, on my signal, the two squadrons will...

1092
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,520
好吧
Right, okay.

1093
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:31,640
面条小队将...
The noodle squadron will...

1094
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,970
好  总之一定要记住
Okay. Anyway, the important thing to remember

1095
01:02:38,970 --> 01:02:41,000
这个地点就是...
is that this is the spot where...

1096
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,300
好吧  不出我所料
Okay, I saw that coming.

1097
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:46,860
牢记一件事
If you only remember one thing,

1098
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:48,250
分散玉僵尸的注意
it's distract the jombies...

1099
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:51,560
直到我足够靠近天煞使出悟习铁指扣
Until I get close enough to put a wuxi finger hold on Kai.

1100
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:53,760
-明白了吗  -明白了
- You got it? - Yeah!

1101
01:02:54,350 --> 01:02:56,400
我数三声  一  二  三  熊
Pandas on three! One, two three, pan...!

1102
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,440
各位  算了  我待会再教这个
You guys... never mind, I'll teach you that later.

1103
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:38,440
我真希望我可以教你这个  儿子
I wish I could have taught you this, son.

1104
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:40,670
没关系  爸  我
It's okay, dad. I'm...

1105
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:48,210
他来了
He's here.

1106
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:15,430
老天
Wow!

1107
01:04:15,430 --> 01:04:18,010
这就是我说的闪亮登场
That's what I call a dramatic entrance!

1108
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:24,840
你一定就是神龙大侠
Ha-ha! You must be the Dragon Warrior.

1109
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,830
你一定就是天煞了
And you must be Kai!

1110
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:30,990
复仇凶兽  寡妇制造者
Beast of vengeance, maker of widows!

1111
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:34,800
没错  总算有人认识我  谢谢
Yes! Finally! Thank you!

1112
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,870
让我都想饶你一命了
Almost makes me wanna spare your life.

1113
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:38,230
你要饶我一命吗
Oh, you wanna spare me?

1114
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:40,470
要不你省省你的废话
How about you spare me the Chit-chat?

1115
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:42,610
怎样  来切磋一下
All right? Let's do this.

1116
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:44,600
我要夺走你的气
I'm going to take your Chi...

1117
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:47,240
接着是所有熊猫的气
Then the Chi of every panda in the...

1118
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,820
又说废话
Oh! Chit-chat!

1119
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:50,430
-这个...  -废话废话废话
- In this... - Chitty-Chitty chat-chat.

1120
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:52,140
-这...  -废话话话话
- In... - Chat, chat, chat.

1121
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:53,580
-这个...  -废话
- In the... - Chit-chat!

1122
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:56,380
你个小胖子
Oh, you pudgy little...

1123
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:02,650
包围他们
Round them all up.

1124
01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:18,620
不  是真的
Oh, no. It's true.

1125
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:20,600
你们都被变绿了
You guys have all been turned green!

1126
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:23,930
除了你  螳螂  你本来就是绿的
Except for you, Mantis. You were already green.

1170
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:35,870

No. No!

1171
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:42,890
其实没有用
No, it's not.

1172
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:45,120
是乌龟教你这个小把戏的吗
Did ’ogway teach you that little trick?

1173
01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:46,590
真遗憾

1174
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:48,820
这招只对凡人有用
It only works on mortals.

1175
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:52,850
而我是灵界武士

1184
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,130

把我送回灵界吗
send me back to the Spirit Realm?

1187
01:10:40,450 --> 01:10:42,930
你只是个愚蠢的凡人罢了
You are just a stupid mortal.

1188
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:46,300
这招只对凡人有用
It only works on mortals.

1189
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:50,830
你说得对  我不能送走你
You're right. I can't send you there.

1190
01:10:51,810 --> 01:10:53,790
但我可以带你一起去
But I can take you there.

1191
01:10:53,790 --> 01:10:54,950
那是什么
What's that?

1192

1197
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:27,600
怎么回事
What happened?

1198
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:29,090
阿宝去哪里了
Where's Po?

1199
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:32,930
他带走了天煞  他救了我们
He took Kai away. He saved us.

1200
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:33,900

01:11:35,970 --> 01:11:39,040
他救了我们  可谁来救他呢
He saved us, but who's saving him?

1204

你带我回来了
You brought me back?

1205
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:53,850
这可不怪我
Don't blame me.

1206
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:55,770
我曾试图在凡界了结一切
I tried to finish this in the regular realm.

1207
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:57,960
那我们就在这里做个了断

1208
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:34,660
儿子  上啊  战斗啊

We can do this.

1214

跑动起来效果真心酷
When I run with it, then it looks really cool.

1274
01:18:11,970 --> 01:18:14,180
很适合你  你成长了
It suits you. You've grown.

1275
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:16,300
是啊  快把熊猫自助餐吃关门了
Yep. I gotta lay off the panda buffet.

1276
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:18,080
长大了
Grown up...

1277
01:18:19,330 --> 01:18:20,640
就像我给你父亲传信时
As I hoped you would

1278
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,420
所期望的那样
when I sent the message to your father.

1279
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:27,010
原来来自上天的消息是你送的
You sent the universe mail. Whoa!

1280
01:18:27,010 --> 01:18:28,340
对
Yes.

1281
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:31,160
因为这个世界需要你
Because the universe needed you.

1282
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:32,310
我吗
Me?

1283
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:38,210
你终于成为命中注定的那只熊猫了
You finally became the panda you were always meant to be.

1284
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:40,390
但你怎么知道我可以
But, how'd you know I could?

1285
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,700
在我们相遇的第一天
On the first day we met...

1286
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:46,410
我看见了功夫的未来
I saw the future of kung fu.

1287
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:50,980
和过去
And the past.

1288
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:57,330
我看到能将它们融合的熊猫
I saw the panda who could unite them both.

1289
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:00,160
这就是我选中你的理由  阿宝
That is why I chose you, Po.

1290
01:19:00,630 --> 01:19:03,790
你拥有阴阳两面
Both sides of a Yin and Yang.

1291
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:08,040
是我真正的继承者
And my true successor.

1292
01:19:10,950 --> 01:19:13,530
我  我不能收
Me? I can't take that.

1293
01:19:13,530 --> 01:19:15,200
收下吧
Just take it.

1294
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:16,710
我有个更大的
I have a bigger one.

1295
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:21,900
您拥有无穷的智慧  而我只是...
I mean, you're enlightened and everything. I'm just...

1296
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:25,180
真的吗
Really?

1297
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:26,290
对
Yes.

1298
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,420
我们该怎么办
Now what do we do?

1299
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:40,800
你决定
You tell me.

1300
01:19:41,450 --> 01:19:43,940
不  乌龟  别走
No. Oogway, don't go!

1301
01:19:43,970 --> 01:19:47,210
我哪也不去  我住在这里
I'm not going anywhere. I live here.

1302
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,100
好吧
Oh, right.

1303
01:19:49,770 --> 01:19:53,500
是你要决定留下还是离开
It's you who must decide whether to stay or go.

1304
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,840
等等  我可以回去吗
Wait. I can go back?

1305
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:59,040
谁知道呢  我从没试过
Who knows? I've never tried.

1306
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:26,770
阿宝
Po!

1307
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,700
你可以飞
You can fly!

1308
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:37,220
爸  爸
Dad. Dad.

1309
01:20:37,390 --> 01:20:38,480
爸爸们
Dads!

1310
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:40,060
儿子
Son!

1311
01:20:42,730 --> 01:20:45,620
再也不许从花瓣里消失了
Don't you go disappearing in petals ever again.

1312
01:20:45,620 --> 01:20:47,260
我们以为我们失去你了
We thought we lost you.

1313
01:20:47,370 --> 01:20:49,190
不  你们救了我
No, you saved me.

1314
01:20:50,170 --> 01:20:51,740
大家救了我
You all did.

1315
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,610
快过来
Now, come on over here!

1316
01:20:56,230 --> 01:20:57,350
抱一抱
Hugs!

1317
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:02,200
师父
Master Shifu!

1318
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:05,430
学生真正变成了老...
The student has truly become the tea...

1319
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,000
等等  你从哪里得到这个的
Wait. Where did you get that?

1320
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,290
这个啊  乌龟在灵界给我的
Oh, this. Oogway gave it to me in the Spirit Realm.

1321
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,270
果然是他
Of course he did.

1322
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:14,310
我觉得我掌握气功了
I think I mastered Chi.

1323
01:21:16,590 --> 01:21:17,860
当然了
Of course you did.

1324
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:21,450
你可以教我吗
Can you teach me?

1325
01:21:24,910 --> 01:21:26,110
准备好了
Ready!

1326
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:55,750
金猴  帮帮我

Greeny baby!

1328
01:21:57,460 --> 01:21:58,700
放开我
Get 'em off me!

1329
01:22:06,010 --> 01:22:07,460
你好啊
Hello.

1330
01:22:17,740 --> 01:22:18,970
接招吧
Skadoosh.

1331
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:27,810
熊猫哮喘
Panda asthma.
