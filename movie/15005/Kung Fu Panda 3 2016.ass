兄弟們 你們先行一步
Hey, guys, just start without me.

28
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,890
我稍後就來
I'll catch up.

29
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,910
舒坦
Sweet.

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,710
波瀾不驚 方能心如止水
Inner peace. Inner peace.

31
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,370
鼻子好癢
Itchy nose.

32
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,690
阿嚏
Ah-choo!

33
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,230
終於靜心了
Finally, inner peace.

34
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,060
又怎麼了
Now, what?

你我之爭早在五百年前就結束了
Our battle ended 500 years ago.

38
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,990
可我已經準備好再比一場了
Well, now I'm ready for a rematch.

39
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,920
你準備得可真夠久的 哈哈哈
Took you long enough. Ha ha ha ha...

40
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,490
呀啊
Yaaa!

41
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,130
你變強了
You've grown stronger.

42
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,200
五百年靈界的修煉 不是白練的
500 years in the Spirit Realm, you pick up a thing or two.

43
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:36,790
我已經奪走了靈界每個大師的氣
I have taken the Chi of every Master here.

44
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,740
- 不 - 是的
- No! - Yes.

45
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,480
很快你的力量也是我的了
And soon I will have your power too.

46
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:47,100
你何時才能領悟 索取越多 收獲越少
When will you realize, the more you take, the less you have.

47
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:12,100
有了你的氣 我終於又可以重回凡界
With your Chi, I will finally be able to return to the mortal world,

48
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:16,050
這一次 你阻止不了我了
And this time, you won't be there to stop me.

49
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:20,080
噢 阻止你從來都不是我的使命
Ah, it was never my destiny to stop you.

50
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,950
我已經有了一個好的人選
I have set another on that path.

51
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,770
那我就找到他 然後把他的氣也奪走
Then I will find him, and take his Chi too.

52
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,940
正義就要得到伸張了
Justice, is about to be served.

53
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,160
給我們來兩份正義套餐 謝謝
We'll have two justice platters , please

54
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,210
- 呃 三份 - 三份 - 再要幾個豆腐花
- umm...three - Three. - And a few tofu buns.

55
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,910
還要一碗香辣拌面 給嬌虎的 你要另外加醬料嗎
Oh, the spicy noodle soup for Tigress. Did you want extra sauce with that?

56
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,050
她要多加醬料的
She wants it on the side

57
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,010
- 多加醬料 - 多加醬料
- On the side. - On the side.

58
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,670
神龍 你能做到
Dragon, you can do it.

59
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,020
- 沖吧 神龍大俠 - 保衛村莊
- Go, Dragon Warrior. - Defend the valley.

60
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,160
- 去呀 神龍大俠 - 保衛村莊
- Go Dragon Warrior. - Yeah, defend the valley

61
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,310
啊噠
Yee-ha!

62
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,490
你們沒擺華麗的造型對吧
You guys aren't doing the dramatic pose , are you?

63
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,130
我們需要每次出場都擺個造型嗎
Do we have to strike a pose every time we land?

64
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,390
大夥兒 永遠不要低估華麗出場的威力
You guys, never underestimate the power of a dramatic entrance.

65
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,340
我聽說某些大師只靠破門之勢
I've heard about some Masters who could win a fight

66
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,840
就能閃瞎對手贏得戰斗
just by throwing open a door

67
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,270
嘿呀
Shuh-sha!

68
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,060
華麗出場
Dramatic entrance?

69
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,040
師傅
Master Shifu

70
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,150
神龍大俠說得對
The Dragon Warrior is correct.

71
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,830
是嗎 我只是隨口... 啊對 我就這個意思
Really? I was just making.... yeah, I mean, yeah, I am.

72
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,080
雙方交戰先比氣勢 後比拳頭
Before the battle of the fist comes the battle of the mind.

73
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,550
因此 出場就是要華麗
Hence...the dramatic entrance.

74
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,010
哇 好華麗的出場
Whoa ,nice dramatic entrance.

75
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,730
- 今天是什麼日子呀 - 今天將是我的最後一堂課
- What's the occasion? - Today will be my final class.

76
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,330
你的最後...等等 我都不知道你病了
Your final...? Wait. I didn't even know you were sick.

77
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,320
- 雖然你看上去是有點... - 我沒病
- Although you have been looking a little.... - I'm not sick.

78
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,210
健康 有點健康 應該說很健康
healthy. A little healthy. A lot actually.

79
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,230
之所以是最後一課
My final class because from now on...

80
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,300
是因為接下來 負責你們訓練的將會是神龍大俠
your training will be in the hands of the Dragon Warrior.

81
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,710
什麼
What?

82
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,620
我來教 為什麼不是嬌虎
Me? teach? I mean why not Tigress?

83
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,550
她總是喜歡吆喝別人做這個做那個
She's always telling everyone what to do.

84
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,700
- 閉嘴 阿寶 - 看到了吧
- Be quiet Po. - See what I mean?

85
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,890
嬌虎不是神龍大俠 你才是
Tigress is not the Dragon Warrior. You are.

86
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,280
別鬧了 他們可是蓋世五俠 我能教他們什麼呀
Come on they're the Five. What can I teach them?

87
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,510
學海無涯 就連師傅也是
There is always something more to learn. Even for a Master.

88
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,120
打個比方 我來教你另一招
For instance, let me show you another move.

89
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,740
華麗退場
The dramatic exit.

90
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,570
那是啥
What's that?

91
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,220
哇
Whoa!

92
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,010
你在開玩笑嗎 這...
Are you kidding me? That....what?

93
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,390
- 他去哪兒了 - 師傅
- Where'd he go? - Master.

94
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,480
他已經走啦 別那麼嚴肅
- He's gone guys. It's cool.

95
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,400
聽從您的指點 師傅
- We await your instruction, Master.

96
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:06,290
你盡管放馬過來便是
All you have to lose is our respect.

97
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,550
說實話 能有多糟糕呢
Seriously, how bad could it be?

98
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,630
非常糟糕 非常非常糟糕
Very bad! Very, very bad!

99
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,430
好了 我們換別的招式 金猴 使出穩如泰山
Okay. Okay, let's switch it up. Monkey, Immovable Mountain Stance.

100
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,130
是 師傅
Yes, Master.

101
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,050
- 我是說... 嬌虎 旋風後空翻 - 是 師傅
- I mean.... Tigress, Tornado back flip. - Yes, Master.

102
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,610
- 噢不 火 - 開火
- Oh no, fire. - Fire.

103
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,710
抱歉 我的錯 仙鶴再飛高點 啊不 低一點
Sorry, my fault. Crane go high, I mean low.

104
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,160
啊 我的小鉗子
Oh, my claw thingy.

105
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,740
呃 靈蛇和嬌虎 來一招虎嘯蛇盤
Uh, Viper and tigress , to... like a totem pole.

106
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,760
放毒 進攻
Poison , Technique.

107
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:44,590
你們倆 使出白鶴亮翅 猴子摘桃 黃馬褂...
You two, to... Sworming insect bite with yellow tail , Yellow jacket...

108
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,140
香辣...金槍魚
Spicy....tuna.

109
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,360
你幹的好事 阿寶
Good job, Po.

110
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,620
啊
Ah.

111
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:00,100
你有學到一點點東西嗎
Did you at least learn a little something?

112
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,010
有 你不是當老師的料
Yes , that you can't teach.

113
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,260
還有 原來嬌虎是易燃物
And tigress is flammable, turns out.

114
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,150
簡直慘不忍睹
That was a complete disaster.

115
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,370
- 我真慶幸自己不是阿寶 - 他真是一無是處
- I'm glad we're not Po right now. - What a loser.

116
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,310
不知道師傅是怎麼想的
- What was Shifu thinking?

117
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,110
烏龜大師又是怎麼想的
- What was Oogway thinking?

118
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,900
- 我覺得被他聽到了 - 我啥都沒聽到
- I think he heard us. - I didn't hear anything.

119
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,610
他說你一無是處
He said you're a loser.

120
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,280
對不起 烏龜
Sorry, Oogway.

121
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,660
- 你能不能別這樣了 - 你的第一課感覺如何
- Would you stop doing that? - How was your fisrt day teaching?

122
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,940
- 超丟臉 - 我聽說了
- Humiliating. - I heard.

123
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,680
誰告訴你的 是嬌虎嗎
Who told you? Did Tigress tell you?

124
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:59,760
金猴 仙鶴 螳螂 你爸和隔壁禮品店的周大媽
I heard from Monkey and Crane and Mantis and your dad and Mrs. Chau from the gift shop

125
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,430
還有剛走過的那群鴨子以及嬌虎告訴我的
And those ducks who just passed and Tigress told me.

126
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,580
好吧 那她有沒有告訴你我以後再也不會了
Yeah, well did she also tell you that it'll never happen again cause I'm done?

127
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,830
你是指授課 還是丟臉
Teaching, or being humiliated?

128
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,900
都是 我都不知道你為什麼認為我能教他們呢
Both. I don't know why you ever thought I could teach that class?

129
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,530
我就知道你不行
Oh, I knew you couldn't.

130
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,670
啥 你故意的嗎 為什麼
What? You set me up to fail? Why?

131
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,740
如果你只做你力所能及的事 你就沒法進步
If you only do what you can do you'll never be more than you are now.

132
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,560
我不想要進步了 我這樣就很好
I don't wanna be more. I like who I am.

133
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,400
你連自己是誰都不知道
You don't even know who you are.

134
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:30,740
你說啥 我當然知道 我是神龍大俠
What do you....? Of course I do. I'm the Dragon Warrior.

135
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,790
那神龍大俠究竟意味著什麼呢
And what exactly does that mean Dragon Warrior?

136
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,740
意味著...我要四處闖蕩 拳打腳踢
It means...you know... just going around and punching and kicking

137
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,470
保衛家園什麼的
Defending the valley and stuff.

138
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,230
拳打腳踢
Punching and kicking?

139
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,440
你認為這就是烏龜大師看中你的原因嗎
You think that is what the great Master Oogway saw for you?

140
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,620
一個五百年的預言選中了你
A five hundred year prophecy full-filled

141
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,880
難道就是讓你耍耍花拳繡腿
so you can spend your days...

142
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:59,230
滿鎮子亂跑跟兔子耍帥嗎
Kicking butt? And running through town high-fiving bunnies?

143
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,090
- 不是嗎 - 不是
- Yes. - No!

144
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,710
阿寶 烏龜與我的意見相悖 他在你身上看到了潛能
Oogway saw greatness in you, Po, against my better judgement.

145
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,880
比你想象的還要多
More than you can see in yourself.

146
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:13,440
有一種神功等著你去發掘
Incredible power awaits you.

147
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:18,450
這種神功強大到你無法想像
Power beyond anything you can imagine.

148
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,450
哇噢
Whoa!

149
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,290
- 這是什麼神功 - 這就是氣功
- What was that? - That was chi.

150
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,870
哇噢 氣是啥
Whoa! What's chi?

151
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,900
世間萬物流轉的能量就是氣
The energy that flows through all living things.

152
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,940
所以你的意思是 如果我當了他們的老師
So you're saying if I, so you're saying if I teach,

153
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,400
我就可以練成這種神功了嗎
I'll be able to do cool stuff like that?

154
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,070
不 我是說如果你當了他們的老師後
No, I'm saying if you teach,

155
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,070
我就可以練成這種神功了
I'll be able to do cool stuff like that.

156
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:57,300
- 噢 - 氣的運用需要自我修煉
- Oh. - Mastery of chi requires Mastery of self.

157
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:01,070
烏龜曾在一個山洞堨揮冗蒝膉T十年
Oogway sat alone in a cave for thirty years

158
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,200
只為弄清一個問題
asking one question....

159
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,100
我是誰
Who am I?

160
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,760
我是誰
Who am I?

161
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:10,400
如果你能安靜五分鐘讓我說完就好了
I'm lucky if I get 5 minutes before you interrupt.

162
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,700
所以我現在要找個山洞呆上三十年嗎
So now I have to sit alone in a cave for thirty years?

163
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:15,690
總歸要的 當你完成授課的時候
Eventually. After you Master teaching.

164
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,920
授課 我根本不可能做到像你這樣
Teaching? There's no way I'm ever gonna be like you.

165
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,250
我沒讓你變成我這樣
I'm not trying to turn you into me.

166
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:25,200
我是讓你變成你自己
I'm trying to turn you into you.

167
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,620
讓我變成我自己 等會兒 這沒道理啊...
Turn me into me? Wait a second. That makes no....

168
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:36,440
加把勁 師傅 說得再玄乎一點 你就是下一個烏龜了
Almost there Shifu , just a little more confusing and you'll be the next Oogway.

169
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,290
噢 啊
Oh. Ah.

170
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,840
抱歉 烏龜大師 無意冒犯...
Sorry, no offense Master Oogway I just....

171
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,840
我就不打擾您的安寧了
I'll let you get back to your eternal peace.

172
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:29,570
- 這是哪兒 - 呃 我哥哥的菜地
- What is this place? - Aaah...my brother's farm?

173
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:34,690
哦 那如果我踩你一腳 你會死嗎
Ah. If I stepped on you, would you die?

174
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,340
會
Yes.

175
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,550
這就是凡界
The mortal realm.

176
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,480
你聽到了嗎 烏龜 我回來了
You hear that Oogway? I'm back.

177
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:48,460
天煞回來了
Kai has returned.

178
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,450
- 誰 - 天煞 所向披靡的天煞
- Who? - Kai. General Kai.

179
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,850
這片神州大地最高的統帥
Supreme warlord of all China.

180
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,260
沒聽過
I don't know.

181
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,170
追魂翡翠 苦難之源
The jade slayer, Master of pain.

182
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,220
那你至少應該聽過復仇之獸吧
You may know me as the beast of vengeance.

183
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,310
寡婦制造者呢
Maker of widows?

184
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,090
好吧 我以前跟烏龜是戰友
Ok, I used to work with Oogway.

185
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,160
哦 烏龜大師 他可是名副其實的戰士
Oh, Master Oogway, he was a great warrior.

186
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,920
我們知道烏龜大師 又智慧又...
- We've heard of Master Oogway. Wise and...

187
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,890
好了好了 夠了
- Ok, ok, enough.

188
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,710
閉嘴
Silence!

189
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,410
找到烏龜的弟子 全部抓來見我
Find Oogway's students and bring them to me.

190
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,460
等我奪走了他們的氣 烏龜...
By the time I am done with them, Oogway...

191
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:42,280
這世上就沒人會記得你的名字了
There will be no one left to who will even remember your name.

192
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:46,580
哈哈哈 我天煞來了
Ha ha ha! Kai is coming!

193
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,930
我準備好了...
I am ready...

194
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,510
- 來教訓你了 - 教訓我
- to teach you a lesson. - Teach me?

195
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,880
- 哦不 是神龍大師 - 媽呀他太帥了
- Oh no, ite's the Dragon teacher. - Yeah he's so handsome.

196
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,960
多謝誇獎
Thank you for the compliment.

197
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:04,190
不 繞我一命吧
No, please don't teach me to death.

198
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,660
阿寶
Po?

199
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,920
嗨老爸 你好嗎
Oh, hey dad. What's up?

200
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,720
我只是 回家泡個澡而已
I like just .... stopping by for a little soak.

201
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,380
- 說吧 出什麼事啦 - 沒事
- Okay , What's wrong? - Nothing.

202
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,200
沒事 我回家發現你在這跟你的娃娃鴛鴦戲水...
Nothing? I come home to find you taking a bath with your dolls...

203
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,990
- 是人偶 - 而且加的不是浴鹽
- Action figures. - And instead of adding bath-salt to the water.

204
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:28,840
- 反而加了四川辣椒面 - 啥 四川辣椒面
- You just added szechuan peppercorns. - Szechuan, what?

205
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,810
噢 噢 我白嫩的小屁股
Oh, oh, oh... my tenders.

206
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,430
好啦 我是有心事
Okay, yes, something's wrong.

207
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:38,580
乖兒子 告訴爸爸發生了什麼事
There, there, son , you tell your daddy all about it.

208
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,090
胳膊抬起來
Lift your arm.

209
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,170
師傅說我還不知道神龍大俠的意義
Shifu says I don't know what it means to be the Dragon Warrior.

210
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,450
現在我居然還要當老師了
And now I have to be a teacher?

211
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,180
我以為我找到了自我
I thought I finally knew who I was.

212
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,340
可如果我不是神龍大俠 那麼我又是誰呢
If I'm not the dragon Warrior, then who am I?

213
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,000
老師 教人功夫嗎
A teacher? Teaching kung fu?

214
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:55,390
阿寶 這可是份美差啊 還猶豫啥 兒子
Po, that's a promotion. Take the job, son.

215
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,360
等有一天 你掌管了翡翠宮
And someday, when you're in charge of the whole Jade palace,

216
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,760
我就可以在大廳婼甇控齯F 喲呼
I can sell noodles in the lobby. Yoohoo.

217
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,090
你怎麼還在這泡澡 跟個娃娃似的
Why are you still here taking a bath like a baby?

218
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,950
起來 起來 趕緊去幹活
Get out. Get up. Go, go, go.

219
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,100
我們的店面就要擴張啦
- Franchise expansion awaits us!

220
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,390
那神龍大俠模仿大賽怎麼辦
- What about the Dragon Warrior look alike contest?

221
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:14,010
- 反正周大媽每次都贏 - 接招吧
- Mrs. Chau always wins that. - Skadoosh.

222
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,400
那神龍大俠吃包子大賽呢
And the Dragon Warrior dumpling eating contest?

223
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,820
我要保持我的不敗記錄
I have to defend my title.

224
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,270
沒有人能打破你吃包子的記錄
No one's gonna beat your dumpling eating record.

225
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,360
有人要打破你吃包子的記錄啦
Someone's about to beat your dumpling eating record.

226
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,600
加油 加油
Go. Go. Go.

227
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,970
- 誰在吃我的包子 - 賬算在誰頭上
- Who's eating my dumplings? - And who's paying for them?

228
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,990
一百零一 一百零二
101, 102.

229
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:43,590
一百零三
103.

230
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,560
耶
Yeah!

231
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,580
新紀錄嗎
Is that a new record?

232
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,380
你是誰
Who are you?

233
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,670
- 我是李山 - 什麼
- I'm Li Shan - What?

234
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,280
我叫李山
I'm Li shan.

235
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,980
我在找我兒子
I'm looking for my son.

236
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:11,580
- 你兒子不見了 - 是啊 多年以前丟的
- You lost your son? - Yes, many years ago.

237
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:15,590
- 我也跟我爸爸失散了 - 真抱歉
- I lost my father. - Very sorry.

238
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,560
謝謝你
Thank you.

239
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,880
好吧 祝你好運
Well , good luck to you.

240
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,510
你也是 希望你能找到你兒子
You too. I hope you find your son.

241
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,230
我也希望你能找到你爸爸
And I hope you find your father.

242
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,930
- 兒子 - 哈
- Son? - Huh?

243
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:44,220
我的天啊 真是你
Oh my gosh, it is you.

244
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,730
別傻站著呀 快給你老爸一個擁抱
Well, don't just stand there! Give your old man a hug!

245
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,130
不敢相信你還活著
I can't believe you're alive.

246
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,120
- 耶 - 耶
- Yeah! - Yeah!

247
00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:00,470
我以為我永遠地失去你了 小蓮花
I thought I'd lost you forever, Little Lotus.

248
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,170
好吧 這下有點尷尬了
Oh, Okay. This is very embarrassing,

249
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,870
我想你認錯兒子了 我不叫蓮花 我叫阿寶
but I think you've got me confused with a panda named Lotus. My name is Po.

250
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,040
啊對了 你也許...
Oh right, you wouldn't... Okay.

251
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:13,380
這麼說吧 小蓮花是你的乳名
See, Little Lotus was the name you were given at birth.

252
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,750
- 真的嗎 - 真的
- Really? -Really.

253
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,800
難以置信 這麼多年了終於找到你了
I can't believe it. After all these years and you're really here?

254
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,520
這簡直太神奇了
This is amazing.

255
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,150
老爸 這位是...
Oh, Dad. Come say hi to...

256
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,420
呃 我不知道應該怎麼稱呼你
Um. I don't know--I don't know what I'm supposed to call you.

257
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,670
他剛才說他叫李山
I'm pretty sure he said his name is Li.

258
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,670
你 來抱抱
You...come here

259
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:36,180
太謝謝你了 把我的兒子照顧得那麼好
Thank you, thank you for taking such good care of my son.

260
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:39,510
你的兒子 先等等
Your son? Now hold on just a minute.

261
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:43,360
我們怎麼知道這個人跟你有沒有聯系
How do we know this stranger is even related to you?

262
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:47,430
你看啊 一看肚子就知道是自家人
Look at that. Our bellies could be brothers.

263
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,590
嘿兒子 我來教你怎麼拱肚子 來 拱肚子
Hey son, let me teach you how to Belly Gong. All right, belly gong.

264
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,570
太酷炫了 它們震動的頻率還一致
That's so cool. They jiggle the same.

265
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,420
好像在照鏡子一樣
It's like looking in a fat mirror.

266
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,120
真想不到 我們還能一起合影
I can't believe we're taking a picture together.

267
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:08,350
我還是不明白 我以為阿寶是最後一只熊貓了
But I still don't understand. I thought Po was the only panda left.

268
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,940
- 不 還有一大群呢 - 在哪
- No, there's a whole bunch of us. - Where?

269
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:16,320
- 就在山堛滲垢絢翕艂矙 - 神秘熊貓...

00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,010
要不然的話 那就不是可怕了 而是蠢了
otherwise it won't be scary, it'll be just stupid.

401
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,530
不是他們在說話 白癡
It's not them talking, you idiots!

402
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,950
是我在通過他們說話 我是天煞
It's me talking through them, Kai!

403
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,040
- 誰 - 好好 夠了
- Who? - Okay, okay, enough.

404
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,680
- 看到了嗎 看到了嗎 - 發生了什麼
- Did you see that? Did you see? - What just happened?

405
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,170
那些綠煙就咻的一下 又咻地消失了
The green smoke just poof.... and then poof.

406
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,600
師傅 那是什麼
Shifu, what wast that?

407
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,870
天煞 天煞 天煞 是誰呢
Kai? Kai? Kai?

408
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:58,010
不知道 沒聽過
Nope. Never heard of him.

409
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,830
天煞 天煞 在哪
Kai... Kai... Where is it?

410
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,690
這堣茼h裝滿智慧的卷軸了 什麼都找不到
There's so much wisdom in here, I can't find anything.

411
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,130
找到了
Yes!

412
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,530
看好了
Behold.

413
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,520
所有答案都將在這塈鋮
All the answers will be found within.

414
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,140
什麼 一片空白
What? It's blank?

415
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:19,460
是在耍我嗎 又來這套
Are you kidding me? Not again.

416
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:25,220
等等 等一下 抱歉 好了 我們開始吧
Wait, wait. Hold on. Sorry, okay, here we go.

417
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,410
是烏龜親手寫的
It is written in Oogway's hand.

418
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,410
- 很久以前 我有一個兄弟 - 烏龜竟然有兄弟
- Long ago, I had a brother. - Oogway had a brother?

419
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,470
戰友 是戰友 抱歉
In arms. In arms, sorry.

420
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,290
他寫的是兄弟般的戰友
- He says brother in arms.

421
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,240
你就不能一次性展開卷軸嗎
- Can't you just unroll it all at once?

422
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:44,020
我曾是一名雄心勃勃的年輕戰士 帶領一支偉大的軍隊
I was an ambitious young warrior leading a great army.

423
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,870
與我並肩作戰的就是天煞
And fighting by my side was Kai.

424
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,820
我最親密的朋友
My closest friend.

425
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,080
有一天 我們遭到了埋伏 我身負重傷
One day we were ambushed. I was badly wounded.

426
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:04,170
我的朋友背著我日以繼夜地尋求幫助
My friend carried me for days looking for help.

427
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:08,960
最後我們來到一個高山上的神秘村莊
Until we came to a secret village, high in the mountains.

428
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:12,070
古老的療傷聖地
An ancient place of healing.

429
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,640
全村都是熊貓
A village of pandas.

430
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:19,040
- 熊貓 - 對 熊貓
- Pandas? - Yes, pandas.

431
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:24,040
熊貓他們用氣功治好了我
Pandas who used the power of chi to heal me.

432
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,320
他們還教會我如何釋放氣
They taught me how to give chi.

433
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:39,490
但天煞想獨占所有氣
But Kai, wanted the power all to himself.

434
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:44,730
他發現氣既能被給予 也能被奪走
He saw that what could be given could also be taken.

435
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:50,980
我必須阻止他
I had to stop him.

436
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,740
我們打得山搖地動
Our battle shook the Earth.

437
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:03,010
最終 我將他打入靈界
Until, finally, I banished Kai to the Spirit Realm.

438
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,820
若他重返人間
Should he ever return to the mortal realm,

439
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:10,140
唯有真正的氣功大師才能阻止他
he can only be stopped by a true Master of chi.

440
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:13,070
真正的氣功大師 比如你
True Master of chi? Like you.

441
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,200
我 我只能發功讓花盛開而已
Me? I can barely make a flower bloom!

442
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,650
我至少還要在山洞堶袚狺T十年
I'd need at least thirty more years, and a cave.

443
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,200
我們需要一個氣功大師
We need a chi Master.

444
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:23,320
他會繼續奪走別的大師的氣 世上就再也沒氣了
He will continue stealing the chi of Masters until he has consumed it all.

445
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,360
我們必須想辦法阻止他
We have to make a way to stop him.

446
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:27,180
敗下的大師越多 他得到的氣也就越多
He gets more more powerful with every Master he defeats.

447
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,840
我們沒別的選擇 只能去戰斗
There is no choice. We fight.

448
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,180
我可以教你 兒子
I can teach you, son.

449
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:37,590
- 你可以教我 - 當然 我是只熊貓
- You can do this? - Of course, I'm a panda.

450
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:40,680
這肯定是宇宙讓你來的原因
That must be why the universe sent you here.

451
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,000
好 那我要做什麼
Okay, so what do I have to do?

452
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,920
- 你要跟我回家 - 什麼
- You have to come home with me. - What?

453
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:48,610
- 回到神秘村莊 - 對 兒子
- To the secret village? - Yes, son.

454
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:52,540
你必須重新學會如何做一只熊貓
You must rediscover what it is to be a panda.

455
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:56,230
你要學會如何像熊貓那樣生活 像熊貓那樣睡覺
You have to learn how to live like a panda. Sleep like a panda.

456
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,810
像熊貓那樣吃東西
Eat like a panda.

457
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,560
103個包子 還沒夠我塞牙縫呢
Those 103 dumplings? I was just warming up.

458
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:07,200
我一直認為 我吃東西的潛力還沒全部挖掘出來
I've always felt like I wasn't eating up to my full potential.

459
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:11,640
你不能把我們家阿寶帶走 不不 我要別的意見
You can't take Po away from me. No, no I want a second opinion.

460
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:14,450
師傅 再開一卷吧
Shifu, open another scroll or something.

461
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,600
- 我覺得他應該去 - 好 再來個意見
- I think he should go. - Fine. A third opinion.

462
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,060
金猴 靈蛇 嬌虎
Monkey? Viper? Tigress?

463
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,920
老爸 你也聽到師傅說的和烏龜寫的
Dad, you heard what Shifu said, Oogway said.

464
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,590
只有真正的氣功大師才能阻止天煞
This guy can only be stopped by a Master of chi.

465
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,310
而我只有知道我究竟是誰才能學會用氣
And I can only master chi by knowing who I really am.

466
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,200
我 我是熊貓
Well, I'm a panda.

467
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:38,820
我去給你準備路上的午餐
I'll pack your lunch for the road.

468
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,220
你真的認為阿寶能及時學會氣功嗎
Do you really think Po can master chi in time?

469
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,930
我的想法並不重要
Doesn't matter what I think.

470
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:53,180
- 宇宙怎麼想才是最重要的 - 所以答案是不會
- It only matters what the universe thinks. - So, that's a "No"?

471
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:56,930
- 師傅 我們要做什麼 - 你去查明天煞的下落
- Master, what are we going to do? - You are going to find out where Kai is.

472
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,350
尋著那些翡翠僵屍的蹤跡 但千萬別跟他打起來
Follow the trail of those jade creatures but do not engage.

473
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:04,020
因為天煞會越戰越強
For with every foe he faces Kai becomes stronger.

474
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:06,670
為什麼選我 是因為我多嘴嗎
- Why me? Is it because I asked.

475
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,320
不是 因為你能飛
- No, it is because you can fly.

476
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:11,930
- 去吧 - 早知道就閉上你的鳥嘴了
- Go! - Should have kept your beak shut.

477
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,570
- 帶上螳螂 - 什麼 因為我插嘴...
- And take Mantis. - What? Oh man, is it because I ...?

478
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,810
對
Yes.

479
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,740
吃點東西嗎
Oh, lunch break?

480
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,170
你不用同樣問題問兩遍
You don't need to ask me twice.

481
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,170
- 老爸 - 幹嘛
- Dad? - Yes?

482
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,130
- 老爸 - 啥
- Dad? - Yes?

483
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,720
你在這媟F什麼
- What are you doing here?

484
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,110
你說我在幹什麼 我背疼死了
- What am I doing? Getting a backache.

485
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,080
你非得在每塊石頭上踩著走嗎
Did you have to step on every rock?

486
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:00,610
- 不 我是說你怎麼在這 - 那你說我該怎麼辦
- No, I mean why are you here? - What was I supposed to do?

487
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,820
如果你不喜歡吃那些熊貓的東西怎麼辦
What if the pandas don't have food you like?

488
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:06,870
你餓著肚子的話 怎麼去拯救世界呀
You're never gonna be able to save the world on an empty stomach.

489
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,290
我覺得我跟著你攸關成敗
I consider my presence mission critical.

490
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,790
關於這點 我們不能告訴外人村莊的位置
Oh yes about that. We can't share the location of the village with others.

491
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:18,070
- 所以... - 你認為我守不住秘密 是吧
- So... - Well, you think I can't keep a secret, huh?

492
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:22,510
我養了阿寶二十年才告訴他 他不是我親手的
I raised Po for 20 years before I finally told him he was adopted.

493
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,390
- 真的嗎 - 真的
- Seriously? - Yeah.

494
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,250
好吧 我想 讓你飛回去是有點殘忍
Okay, I guess it would be cruel to make you fly back.

495
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:33,060
- 你竟然會飛 - 鵝也是鳥好嗎 阿寶
- You can fly? - I'm a bird, Po.

496
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,350
我們到了
We're here.

497
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,950
看上去還要很長一段路
Sure looks like a long ways up there.

498
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:01,710
我兒子最討厭爬階梯了 我們還是回家吧
And my son hates stairs. So, let's go home.

499
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,240
我們可是熊貓 我們才不爬階梯
We're pandas. We don't do stairs.

500
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:07,240
我一輩子都在等著這句話
I've waited my whole life to hear those words.

501
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,110
扯淡
Rats.

502
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:39,180
這就是神秘熊貓村 難怪你們要保密
This is the secret panda village? No wonder you keep it a secret.

503
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:43,080
如果我住在這 我也不好意思告訴別人
If I lived here, I wouldn't tell anyone either.

504
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:51,560
現在你可以"哇"了
Now you can whoa.

505
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:28,560
李山 大家注意 李山回來了
Li? Everyone, Li is back.

506
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:30,710
- 回來了兩個人 - 他找到兒子了
- They're both back. - He found his son.

507
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,900
- 他做到了 - 他們回來了
- He made it. - They're back.

508
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,600
- 李山 - 他找到他兒子了
- Li? - He found his son.

509
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,420
大家 李山回來了
Everyone, Li is back.

510
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,910
等等 我們來了
Hang on, we're coming.

511
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,370
他做到了
He made it.

512
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:42,310
- 他成功了 - 為什麼我們要跑
- He made it! - Why are we running?

513
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,380
- 他做到了 - 李山回來了
- He made it. - Li shan is back.

514
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:01,790
大家都圍過來吧 這是我兒子
Everyone, everyone gather around. This is my son.

515
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:03,780
- 你們好 - 真可愛
- Hello. Hi. - Cute.

516
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,240
- 三胞胎 - 嗨 我是酷酷
- Triplets! - Hi, I'm Ku Ku.

517
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:09,340
- 我是萌萌 - 我是帥帥 他聞起來像餅幹
- I'm Meng Meng. - I'm Shuai Shuai, he smells like cookies.

518
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:14,330
- 他好帥啊 跟他老爸一樣帥 - 謝謝誇獎
- He's so handsome. Just like his father. - Thank you.

519
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,840
兒子 他們是你的表哥 點點和心心
Son, these are your cousins. Dim and Sum.

520
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:20,000
- 我竟然有表哥 - 歡迎 - 歡迎
- I have cousins. - Welcome. - Welcome.

521
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:23,440
- 串在一起的包子 - 我們叫它小吃項鏈
- Buns on a string. - We call it a snacklace.

522
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:25,280
沒錯
That's right.

523
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,030
我們會再給你做一條
We'll make you another one.

524
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,080
是你啊
It's you.

525
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:33,590
- 很高興見到你 嗨 - 其實我不認識你
- So, that's nice to see you. Hi. - I don't know who you are.

526
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,140
花娃娃 好漂亮啊
Stripey baby So beautiful.

527
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,570
小心點 那是我的人偶

533
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:03,290
你就像老年版的我 你就是胖點的我
You're like me but old. You're like me but fatter.

534

阿寶 你在幹什麼 阿寶

我根本不是熊貓
I'm not a panda at all.

549

These? These are chopsticks. They're for picking up dumplings.

555
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,800
你是說 你只一口一個包子
You mean you only eat one at a time?

556

我就知道我在吃方面潛力無限
I knew I wasn't eating up to my potential.

老爸 為啥她一直那樣盯著我看啊
Dad, why does she keep staring at me like that?

568
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,110
試著跟上姐的舞步

582
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,680
在做的事情前面加上"之翼"什麼的
Just because you say "Wings of......"

583
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,440
可不代表你的做法有多特別
before something it doesn't mean that you're doing a special move.

584
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:35,230
就好像我說"強力之刃"或者
It's like me saying, "Antenna of power" or....

585
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,940

They need our help. Come on. I'll go high, you go low.

598
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,250
別 等等
No, wait.

599
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,910
難道還怕只蟲子
Fear the bug.

600

螳螂

Your chi is strong, just like your friend, the bug.

606
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,530
啊 螳螂
Huh? Mantis.

607
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,660
別擔心 小鳥兒 我會讓你的真氣派上好用場的
Don't worry, little birdie. I'll put your chi to good use.

You know, learn to be a panda, Master chi, save the world.

You know, just for you know, showing me what it feels like...

660
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:13,330
是怎樣的感覺
to be a panda.

661
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:16,350
那麼你究竟認為我什麼時候能準備充分呢
- So when do you think I'll be ready?

662
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:17,180
準備充分
- Ready?

663
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,330
就是學習怎樣掌握氣功呀
You know, to learn how to master chi.

664
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,940
很快 很快就可以了
Soon, real soon.

665
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,970
來吧 我想給你看點別的 跟我來
Come on. I wanna show you something else. C'mon

666
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:32,220
真不好意思 這媔瓣C八糟的 我這很少有來訪者
Sorry about the mess, I don't usually get visitors.

667
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:45,540
這是我媽媽麼
Is this my mom?

668
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:54,450
我在你百日的時候完成了這幅畫像
I had this done on your one hundredth day.

669
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,270
你媽媽根本沒法讓你安靜下來
Your mama couldn't hold you still.

670
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,850
你差點把這張紙給吃了
You nearly eat the paper.

671
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,570
- 真的 - 她什麼樣
- It's true. - What was she like?

672
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:10,730
她簡直完美
She was the total package.

673
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:14,840
聰明 美麗
Smart, beautiful.

674
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:17,320
食量巨大
Tremendous appetite.

675
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,640
她是我一生的摯愛
She was the love of my life.

676
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:25,120
然後 就在我覺得人生達到最美滿的時候
And then, just when I thought I couldn't get any luckier.

677
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:28,830
你降臨了 我的小蓮花
Along you came, my Little Lotus.

678
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,690
那時我真的擁有了世界的全部
I really had it all.

679
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:38,830
直到那一天
Until that one moment...

680
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:44,080
當我
When I ...

681
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,650
又失去了一切
lost everything.

682
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:31,090
老爸 你再也不用擔心會失去我了 好嗎
Dad, you don't have to worry about losing me ever again, Okay?

683
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,280
讓我也來抱抱
Let me get some of that.

684
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:53,320
從東部來的消息
It's from the eastern province.

685
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:59,960
蜥蜴大師 紅牛大師 獵鷹大師 他們全部
Master Lizard, Master Ox, Master Eagle, all of them.

686
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:04,730
隔海相望的每一座村莊 天底下每一位功夫大師
In every village from the sea to here. Every Master in china...

687
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:07,580
- 都不見了 - 也許他們都去參加某個宴會了呢
- ... has vanished. - Maybe they are all at a party?

688
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:10,060
- 靈猴 - 我也沒被邀請呀
- Monkey. - I didn't get invited either.

689
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:12,290
是天煞吸走了他們的真氣
Kai has taken their chi.

690
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:16,810
現在只有我們能阻止他了 而龜仙人留下的真傳
We are all that stand between him and the knowledge Oogway left

691
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,970
只有靠我們來守護了
in our care.

692
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:22,220
- 村民們都疏散了嗎 - 全部疏散了 師父
- The villagers, evacuated? - Done, Master.

693
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:24,450
- 仙鶴和螳螂呢 - 還沒有消息
- Crane? Mantis? - Still nothing.

694
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:26,760
啊 等等 他們回來了
Huh! Wait, it's them!

695
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:31,780
不
No!

696
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,320
天煞
Kai

697
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:55,560
好極了 你們就這點本事
Nice, very tacky.

698
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:58,470
你膽敢踏上這片土地
How dare you set foot on these grounds!

699
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,070
看看你們這群可憐的傻瓜吧
Look at your pathetic fools.

700
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:05,140
只知道在烏龜的腳下卑躬屈膝
Groveling at the feet of Oogway the magnificent.

701
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:07,530
你根本不配提及他的名字
You are not fit to speak his name.

702
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:10,880
我不配嗎 小貓咪
I am not fit, little kitten?

703
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:17,180
我曾與他並肩作戰 我待他如同手足
I fought by his side. I loved him like a brother.

704
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:21,450
而他卻背叛了我
And he betrayed me.

705
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:29,440
好吧 那我就毀了他所創造的一切
Well, now I will destroy everything he has created.

706
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:30,840
上
Go!

707
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:54,600
小貓咪讓你感覺如何
How's that for a little kitten?

708
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,080
我不會讓你毀了龜仙人的記憶
I will not let you destroy Oogway's memory.

709
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:15,870
為什麼不呢 他可是毀掉了我的
Why not? He destroyed mine.

710
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:20,050
螳螂 是我啊 你的好哥們
Mantis, it is me, your bestie.

711
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:28,140
對不起 嬌虎 抱歉 抱歉 抱歉
Sorry Tigress. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

712
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,910
抱歉
Sorry.

713
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:46,970
- 師父 - 把他們都給我帶來
- Shifu. - Bring them to me.

714
00:49:56,790 --> 00:50:00,260
- 不行 你必須去找阿寶 - 師父 求你
- No! You must warn Po. - Master please.

715
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:12,790
讓我給你見識 什麼才叫真正的氣功吧 兄弟
I will show you the true power of chi, brother.

716
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:15,530
不
No.

717
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:54,470
龜仙人 原諒我
Oogway, forgive me.

718
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:59,890
嗯 烏龜 你想說什麼 你原諒他了嗎
Hmm, what do you say Oogway? Do you forgive him?

719
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:03,040
你也許能毀掉翡翠宮
You may have destroyed the Jade palace.

720
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:05,940
但你永遠不會得逞的
but you will never succeed.

721
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:09,980
總會有人能阻止你的
There will always be someone to stop you.

722
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:14,690
誰 那只熊貓 他的真氣很強
Who? The panda? His chi is strong but

723
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,910
但那還遠遠不夠
it won't be enough.

724
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:21,750
- 他會落得和你一樣的下場 - 不可能
- He will meet the same fate as you. - No.

725
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:26,420
並且那個村子堥C一只熊貓都會如此
And so will every panda in that village.

726
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:33,870
會的
Yes!

727
00:51:37,410 --> 00:51:40,070
阿寶 我希望你準備好了
Po, I hope you're ready.

728
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:46,170
跳舞吧 小蓮花 跳舞呀
Dance Lotus, dance.

729
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:50,550
真是個帥小夥
He's so handsome.

730
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:54,130
- 你好 - 來個熊抱
- Hi -That's a panda hug.

731
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:56,040
嗨
Hey

732
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:02,190
阿寶
Po.

733
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,810
啊 嬌虎
Huh! Tigress?

734
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,170
她是誰
Who's she?

735
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:45,820
那是誰
Who is that?

736
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:51,370
- 花娃娃 - 你怎麼來了
- Baby stripey baby - What are you doing here?

737
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,740
天煞襲擊了山穀 他抓走了那堜狾釭漸\夫大師
Kai attacked the valley. He's taken every Master in china

738
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,790
包括師父他們 他們 全都走了 阿寶
including Shifu and the others. It's....it's all gone, Po.

739
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:00,170
- 一切 所有人 - 所有人
- Everything, everyone. - Everyone?

740
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:04,080
- 所有人 - 那我的面館呢
- Everyone. - How's my restaurant?

741
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,190
我們一會再談
- We'll talk later.

742
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:08,180
而且 現在他正在來這堛爾穭W
- And now he's on his way here.

743
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:12,490
他是沖著你來的 阿寶 還有所有的熊貓
He's after you, Po. He's after all pandas.

744
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,810
- 我們還有多長時間 - 不多了
- How long do we have? - Not long.

745
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,960
快告訴我你已經學會氣功了
Please tell me you've mastered chi.

746
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:18,650
- 這 抱著孩子 - 老爸 老爸
- Here, take the baby. - Dad, dad.

747
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:19,830
好了 這孩子是誰家的
Okay, who belongs to this one?

748
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,880
你現在必須教我氣功的秘訣了
You need to teach me the secret chi technique now.

749
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:24,150
不 不行 恐怕你還沒準備好
No, no. I'm afraid you need more time.

750
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:26,060
大家快收拾好行裝
Everyone, go get your things.

751
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:28,260
- 我替你拿著 - 我沒時間了 我得立刻學才行
- Let me hand you that. - I don't have more time. I need to learn it now.

752
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:30,750
對不起 你還沒準備好
Sorry, you're not ready.

753
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,750
- 好了 把所有東西都裝好 - 我準備好了
- Okay, pack everything. - I am ready!

754
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:33,560
還不夠
Not quite.

755
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:35,650
究竟是什麼意思啊 你說的每一件事我都照做了
What are you talking about? I've done everything you've asked.

756
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:39,150
我學會了了打瞌睡 在吊床上睡覺 泡熱水澡
I Mastered napping, sleeping in hammocks, the hot tubs.

757
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,170
我完全學會如何做一只熊貓了
I am totally in one with my panda parts

758
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:43,260
為什麼你現在還是不能教我
- Now, why won't you show me?

759
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:44,660
因為我根本就不會
- Because I don't know it!

760
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:48,810
你說什麼
You what?

761
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:50,590
我不會氣功 明白嗎
I don't know it, Okay?

762
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:53,190
沒有人會 或許曾經有人會 但是
No one does. Maybe we used to but...

763
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,210
- 早已失傳了 - 你騙了我
- But not anymore. - You lied?

764
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:58,040
沒有 我
No, I ...

765
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,210
是的
Yes.

766
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:02,960
為什麼
Why?

767
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:04,810
為了救你的命
To save your life.

768
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:08,370
我聽說有個耍刀的瘋子到處找你
I find out some blade-swinging maniac is coming for you.

769
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:10,040
我還能做什麼
What am I supposed to do?

770
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:13,880
- 袖手旁觀嗎 - 當然 我是神龍大俠啊
- Just...just let that happen? - Yes, I'm the Dragon Warrior!

771
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:16,510
對付那些瘋子 那是我的職責
Facing maniacs, that's my job.

772
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,380
但因為你 我讓整個村莊都失去庇護
But because of you, I left the valley unprotected.

773
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:21,480
我讓我的朋友失去保護
I left my friends unprotected.

774
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:24,580
而現在他們都 他們都
And now they're all... they're all...

775
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:26,880
你留下來也會和他們一樣被抓走的
And you would have been, too.

776
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:32,740
我失去過你一次 我不能再次失去你了
I lost you once. I am not going to lose you again.

777
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,280
我不能
I can't.

778
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:43,100
你已經失去我了
You just did.

779
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:56,230
媽媽 抱著我
Mom, pick me.

780
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,720
阿寶 我擔心死你了
Po, I'm so worried for you that

781
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:07,220
以至於一切如我所料都沒能讓我開心
I can't even enjoy being right about everything.

782
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:08,570
現在逃吧 逃吧 逃吧
Now run, run, run,

783
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:10,270
甩開你那小胖腿用最快速度逃吧
as fast as those chubby legs can go.

784
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:13,580
- 逃 現在已經無處可逃了 - 那你打算怎麼辦
- Run? There's nowhere to run. - What are you going to do?

785
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:16,410
我要留下 打倒那個混蛋
I'm gonna stay and fight that monster.

786
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:19,960
阿寶 他可能是個混蛋 但他到底還是你爸爸啊
Po, he may be a monster but he's still your father.

787
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:23,930
- 不是他 是天煞 - 啊 不要
- Not him, Kai. - Huh! No.

788
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:11,910
- 你餓嗎 - 不 真的 不餓
- Hungry? - No, I..... not really.

789
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:14,540
好吧 就吃一個吧
Well, maybe just one.

790
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:19,530
要知道 說謊的人不止你一個
You know, you weren't the only one who was lying.

791
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:24,410
我來到這 不是因為我擔心阿寶會挨餓
I didn't really come along because I was worried Po would go hungry.

792
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:28,080
- 我擔心的是你 - 你擔心我會挨餓
- I was worried about you. - Worried that I'd go hungry?

793
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:33,160
- 不 我擔心你會把阿寶從我身邊奪走 - 什麼
- No, I was worried you'd steal Po from me. - I'd what?

794
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:35,900
我知道這想法很奇怪
I know. That was crazy.

795
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,130
但後來我意識到阿寶的人生出現了你
But I realized having you in Po's life

796
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:42,240
那並不是我的損失
doesn't mean less for me.

797
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:44,970
而是意味著阿寶得到的愛更多
It means more for Po.

798
00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:46,160
喔
Oh.

799
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:50,070
不過 他的人生已經不要我了
Well. I'm not in his life.

800
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:54,110
- 再也不要我了 - 你兒子生你氣了
- Not any more. - Your son got mad at you.

801
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:57,360
- 歡迎加入為人父母的行列 - 你不懂
- Welcome to parenthood. - You don't understand.

802
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:00,740
我騙了他 他再也不會原諒我了
I lied to him. He'll never forgive me.

803
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:02,630
我騙了他二十年啊
I lied to him for 20 years.

804
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:05,940
他一直以為他是從一顆蛋媢憟X來的
He still thinks he came from an egg.

805
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:11,340
有時候我們所做的錯事 往往是出於善意
Sometimes we do the wrong things for the right reasons.

806
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:21,880
聽著 他很難過
Look, he's hurt.

807
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:27,000
也很迷茫 但他還是選擇了拯救世界
He's confused and he still has to save the world.

808
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:30,740
現在正是他最需要我們的時候
He needs the both his dads.

809
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:51,200
- 這樣沒有用 - 會有用的
- This isn't going to work. - It has to.

810
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:53,130
- 你現在頭腦不清醒 - 我很清醒
- You 're not thinking straight. - I am.

811
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,370
- 不是 - 是的
- You're not. - I am.

812
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:56,270
- 不 - 是的 我很好
- No. - Yes, I am.

813
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:59,840
我見過天煞 我知道他的本事如何
I've seen Kai. I've seen what he can do.

814
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:02,730
但他還沒領略過我的本領
But he hasn't seen what I can do.

815
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:08,150
無須鐵指扣
The Wuxi finger hold?

816
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:09,300
這是我的絕招
That's my best move.

817
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:11,280
我只需要找到天煞 捏住他的手指
I just have to get to Kai, grab his finger,

818
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:13,810
然後 走你 他就能滾回靈界
and then, Skadoosh. Back to the Spirit Realm.

819
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:15,850
他有一支翡翠軍團
He has an army of jade warriors.

820
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,700
他們見過的一切他都能夠感知
Everything they see he sees

821
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,410
所以你根本無法抓住他的把柄
so there's no sneaking up on him.

822
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:22,510
- 你沒法近他身 - 這招會管用的
- You will never get close enough. - It's gonna work.

823
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:26,950
只有真正的氣功大師才能夠阻止他
He can only be stopped by a Master of chi.

824
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,450
哦 你跟師父的腔調一模一樣
Oh, you sound just like Shifu with

825
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:31,240
氣功 氣功 氣功 這個氣 那個氣 氣 氣 氣 氣 氣
the chi chi chi. Chi this. Chi that. Chi chi chi chi chi.

826
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:32,830
我不是氣功大師 好嗎
I'm not a Master of chi. Okay?

827
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:35,000
我也不知道我是不是什麼神龍大俠
I don't know if I'm the Dragon Warrior.

828
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:37,010
我甚至不知道我是不是只熊貓
I don't even know if I'm a panda.

829
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:38,870
我連我自己是誰都不知道
I don't know who I am.

830
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:42,110
你是對的
You're right.

831
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:45,040
我沒辦法阻止他和他的大軍
There's no way I can stop him and his army.

832
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:51,840
除非你有一支你自己的軍隊
Unless you had an army of your own.

833
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:57,740
- 你 - 不僅僅是我
- You? - Not just me.

834
00:58:57,750 --> 00:59:01,070
- 我們 - 我們所有人
- Us. - All of us.

835
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:14,280
這麼多年之後我終於找到了我的兒子
I finally found my son after all these years.

836
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:18,410
就算世界末日也不能把我們分開
It's gonna take a lot more than the end of the world to keep us apart.

837
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:22,520
- 但你們都不會功夫啊 - 你可以教我們啊
- But you don't even know kung fu. - Then you will teach us.

838
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:27,300
什麼 我教不了你功夫 我連嬌虎都教不了
What? I can't teach you kung fu. I couldn't even teach Tigress.

839
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:30,910
而她還是功夫高手
And she already knows kung fu!

840
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:36,980
阿寶 我知道我現在是你最不願信任的人
Po, I know I'm the last guy you wanna trust right now.

841
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:40,320
但你必須相信我 我們能做到
But you gotta believe me. We can do this.

842
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:46,000
我們可以學會功夫 我們可以變成你那樣
We can learn kung fu. We can be just like you.

843
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,620
你剛說什麼
What did you just say?

844
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:50,190
- 呃 我們能做到 - 不是
- Uh... We can do this? - No.

845
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:52,090
- 我們可以學會功夫 - 後面一句
- We can learn kung fu? - After that.

846
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:53,890
呃 我 我們可以變成你那樣
Uh... I... We can be just like you?

847
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:55,220
- 沒錯 - 我們真能做到嗎
- Yes! - We can?

848
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,640
不 你們做不到
No, you can't!

849
00:59:58,430 --> 01:00:00,830
但你們不必像我
But you don't have to be.

850
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:04,080
師父當初就是這個意思 我不必把你們變成另一個我
That's what Shifu meant. I don't have to turn you into me.

851
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:06,740
我要做的是激發你們自身的潛能
I have to turn you into you!

852
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,390
這根本說不通啊
That doesn't make any sense.

853
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:10,760
我知道
I know!

854
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:13,580
- 謝謝爸爸們 - 不用謝
- Thanks, dads. - You're welcome?

855
01:00:13,590 --> 01:00:16,470
我要做件自己從未想過能辦到的事
I'm gonna do something I never thought I'd be able to do.

856
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:19,380
我要教功夫
I'm gonna teach kung fu.

857
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:24,650
夥計們 展現出自己最好的水平就是你們真正的優勢
You guys, your real strength comes from being the best you you can be.

858
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:27,430
那麼 你是誰 你擅長什麼
So, who are you? What are you good at?

859
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:31,330
你熱衷什麼 何為你的個人特色
What do you love? What makes you you?

860
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:36,300
很好 很好 接著踢
Yes, good. Good, again.

861
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:40,800
很好 繼續
Good, again.

862
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:42,780
很好 非常好 繼續
Good, good, good, again.

863
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:47,320
- 什麼 - 花娃娃 花娃娃
- Huh? - Stripey baby, stripey baby

864
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:50,310
快點 再快點 揮動這些綢帶
Faster, faster. Roll those ribbons!

865
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,410
抱緊這根木頭 就像是你平生最後一次
Hug that log, you. Hug that log

866
01:00:52,430 --> 01:00:55,460
擁抱它一樣 把這當作是最後的道別
like it's the last time you're ever gonna hug it. Goodbye forever.

867
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:59,090
高點 這次稍微偏向左邊 你能行的
Higher, and a little more to the left this time. You can do it.

868
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:04,190
我不想看到任何一個包子接觸地面
I don't wanna see any of these hit the ground.

869
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,740
等等 給花娃娃留點
Wait, wait, save Stripy Baby some.

870
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:20,550
很好 試試這個
Good, try it with this.

871
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:23,920
現在 試試這些
Now try it with these.

872
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:31,090
很好 試試這個
Good, now try it with these.

873
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:34,570
噢
Oh.

874
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,010
- 啊 - 噢
- Ow. - Oooh.

875
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:06,790
他們準備好了
They are ready.

876
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:08,910
娃娃 他他他
Baby, he he he.

877
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:10,510
什麼
What?

878
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:14,410
注意聽了 因為我不可能重復講十多遍
Okay pay attention cause I'm not gonna go over this ten more times.

879
01:02:14,410 --> 01:02:17,270
村子的唯一入口在這
The only entrance to the village is here.

880
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:22,020
包子小分隊守在這 餅幹小分隊守在這
The dumpling squadron will take position here while the cookie squadron will take position here.

881
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:25,600
那麼當我發令後 這兩個隊就
Now, on my signal, the two squadrons will...

882
01:02:27,170 --> 01:02:31,240
好吧 面條小分隊要
Alright, Okay. The noodle squadron will...

883
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:37,760
好吧 總而言之 應該記住的重點是
Alright. Okay, anyway,the important thing to

884
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:40,850
這就是那個位置
remember is that this is the spot where...

885
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:46,090
好吧 我早猜到會是這樣 你們記住一件事就好
Okay, I saw that coming. If you only remember one thing,

886
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:48,920
分散那群翡翠之屍的注意力 直到我與天煞的距離
it's just distract the jombies until I get close enough to put a

887
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:51,460
近到能使用無須鐵指扣 明白了嗎
Wuxi finger hold on Kai. You got it?

888
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,330
- 明白 - 明白
- Yeah! - Yeah!

889

大家都把手放上來

01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:56,420
數到三喊加油 一 二 三 夥計們
One, two, three panda, you guys...

891
01:02:56,450 --> 01:02:59,230
算了 我下次再教你們那個
Never mind. I'll teach you that later.

892
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:37,480
我真希望自己有教過你這個 兒子
I... I wish I could have taught you this, son.

893
01:03:37,490 --> 01:03:40,270
沒關系的 爸爸 我
It's okay, dad. I'm....

894

哇
Whhhhooooaaa!

896
01:04:14,330 --> 01:04:17,360
這才是我所說的華麗出場嘛
That's what I call a dramatic entrance.

897
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:23,800
哈哈 你肯定就是神龍大俠了
Haha, you must be the Dragon Warrior.

898
01:04:23,810 --> 01:04:26,630
那你肯定是天煞吧
And you must be Kai.

899
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:30,090
復仇之獸 寡婦制造者
Beast of vengeance, maker of widows.

900
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,510
沒錯 終於有人認識我了
Yes, finally.

901
01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:35,990
謝謝 我差點都想饒你一命了
Thank you, almost makes me wanna spare your life.

902
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:37,200
噢 你想饒我一命
Oh, you wanna spare me?

903
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:41,570

How about you spare me the chitchat, alright? Let's do this.

904

Oh no, it's true. You guys have all been turned green.

911
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:23,470
除了你 螳螂 你本來就是綠色的
Except for you, Mantis, you were already green.

912
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:27,050
- 現在動手嗎 - 等信號

913
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:28,560

- 準備好了嗎 - 沖啊

- 肚子 - 鑼
- Belly... - Gong...

919
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,320
沒開玩笑吧
Seriously?

920
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:51,360
- 耶 - 我們成功了
- Yeah! - We did it!

921

938

我不能打師父啊
I can't hit Shifu.

939
01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:29,790
- 我能 - 我也能

01:07:57,660 --> 01:08:00,040
我們來做個了結吧
Let's finish this.

951
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,980
- 不愧是我們的兒子 - 不愧是我們的兒子
- That's our boy! - That's our boy!

952
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:21,080
抱歉 兄弟 得把你打回靈界了
Sorry, buddy. Gotta send you back to the Spirit Realm.

953
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:22,950
走你
Skadoosh.

954
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:26,080
好吧 沒成功
Okay, that didn't work.

955
01:08:26,110 --> 01:08:28,630
我再試一次 走你
Let me try one more time. Skadoosh.

956
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:30,870
走你 走你 走你 怎麼搞的
Skadoosh, skadoosh, skadoosh. What the?

957
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:32,980
等等 起作用了
Hold on, wait. It's working.

958
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:35,220
不 不
No. Nooo!

959
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:41,880
不 沒用
No, it's not.

960
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:44,380
這小把戲是烏龜教給你的嗎
Did Oogway teach you that little trick?

961
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:47,870
真可惜 這招只對凡人管用
Too bad. It only works on mortals.

962
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:51,960
而我是靈界煞星
And I am a spirit warrior.

963
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:53,450
回來吧
Come!

964
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:39,910
兒子
Son!

965

01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:48,150
看來我錯了 真抱歉 快跑 跑啊
I was wrong. I'm sorry. Run. Run!

967
01:09:59,790 --> 01:10:05,590
烏龜 這難道就是命中注定要阻止我的人嗎
So, Oogway, this was the one destined to stop me?

968
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:11,100
我將把他和其餘所有人的氣收入囊中
I will have his chi and then all of theirs.

969
01:10:25,850 --> 01:10:28,060
而你 哈哈哈哈
And you... Hehahahaha.

970
01:10:29,010 --> 01:10:34,330
你真的以為你能把我打回靈界嗎
You really thought you can send me back to the Spirit Realm?

971
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:42,290
你只不過是個愚蠢的凡人
You are just a stupid mortal.

972
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:45,780
只對凡人有效
It only works on mortals.

973
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:50,500
你說的對 我沒法打你回那
You're right. I can't send you there.

974
01:10:51,050 --> 01:10:54,510
但我可以帶你過去 那是什麼
But I can take you there. What's that?

975
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:56,840
噢 什麼
Oh. What?

976
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:58,830
- 阿寶 - 兒子
- Po. - Son!

977
01:10:58,950 --> 01:11:00,740
走你
Skadoosh.

978
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:02,300
- 兒子 - 兒子
- Son! - Son!

979
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:04,540
不
No!

980
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:06,910
- 啊 - 啊
- Aw! - Aw!

981
01:11:24,850 --> 01:11:28,650
怎麼回事 阿寶去哪了
What... What happened? Where is Po?

982
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:31,940
他帶走了天煞 也救了我們
He took Kai away. He saved us.

983
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:33,650
不
No.

984
01:11:34,910 --> 01:11:38,440
他救了我們 那誰來救他
He saved us but who's saving him?

985
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:46,820
哇 靈界 管用了啊
Whoa, the Spirit Realm! It worked!

986
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:49,200
別騎我 你
Get off me, you...

987
01:11:49,230 --> 01:11:52,030
你帶我回來了
You brought me back?

988
01:11:52,130 --> 01:11:54,780
別怪我 我試過在凡界解決這事 但沒成功啊
Don't blame me. I tried to finish this in the regular realm.

989
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:57,490
那我們在這了結吧
And we'll finish it here.

990
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:33,970
加油啊 兒子 跟他拼了
Come on, son. Fight.

991
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:43,040
我們得幫他
We have to help him.

992
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:44,300
我們得幫他
We have to help him.

993
01:12:44,330 --> 01:12:47,330
好了 大家都圍過來 就是這樣 靠近點
Okay, everyone gather around. That's it. Come in close.

994
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:50,340
加油 我們能辦到的
Come on. We can do this.

995
01:12:57,490 --> 01:13:02,760
阿寶 是你教會了我們要做真實的自己
Po, you taught us who we were meant to be.

996
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:07,970
父親
A father.

997
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:15,080
- 朋友 - 踢包小將
- A friend. - A dumpling kicker.

998
01:13:15,110 --> 01:13:18,430
- 致命老奶奶 - 擁抱者
- A lethal fighting machine. - A hugger.

999
01:13:19,810 --> 01:13:22,120
雙截棍女俠
A nunchuck chick.

1000
01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:24,650
花娃娃
Stripey baby.

1001
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:27,480
家人
A family

1002
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,320
真棒
Sweet.

1003
01:13:58,350 --> 01:13:59,540
啊
Ah!

1004
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,000
你是誰
Who are you?

1005
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:17,580
我也有同樣的困惑
I've been asking the same question.

1006
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:23,870
我是熊貓之子
Am I the son of a panda?

1007
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:27,360
還是大鵝之子 我是學生
The son of a goose? A student?

1008
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:29,270
還是老師
A teacher?

1009
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:34,050
結果我發現 我四者皆是
Turns out, I'm all of them.

1010
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:46,490
我就是神龍大俠
I am the Dragon Warrior.

1011
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:49,200
懂嗎 看到這條巨龍了嗎
Get it? See the giant dragon?

1012
01:14:49,230 --> 01:14:50,460
哈哈哈
Ha ha ha!

1013
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:53,100
準備好感受這驚天巨雷吧
Get ready to feel the thunder.

1014
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:55,260
太棒了
This is awesome!

1015
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:58,290
吼吼 哈哈
Ho ho ho ho. Ha ha!

1016
01:15:01,090 --> 01:15:03,840
哇哦
Waa hoo!

1017
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:14,550

肚皮鑼
Belly gong.

1019
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:24,900
神龍擺尾
Butt slap.

1020
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:30,780
要不先吃點午餐吧 我餓死了
Perhaps a bit of lunch cause I'm starving.

1021
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:35,630
不錯
Mmm.

1022
01:15:50,150 --> 01:15:51,970
接招吧
Let's do this!

1023
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:57,450
小心噢
Heads up.

1024
01:16:11,690 --> 01:16:15,940
我花了五百年才奪走烏龜的氣
It took me 500 years to take Oogway's chi.

1025
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:19,560
為了奪走你的氣 我願意再花五百年
I will have yours if it takes me 500 more.

1026
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:23,070
廢話 廢話 都是廢話
Chtity chitty chat chat, chitchat.

1027
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:37,340
你這麼想要我的氣 那就拿去吧
You want my chi so bad? Then take it.

1028
01:16:43,730 --> 01:16:48,590
好啊 力量歸我了
Yes, the power is mine.

1029
01:16:50,190 --> 01:16:53,040
等等 不 太多了
Wait, no. It's too much.

1030
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:55,850
太多了 不
That's too much. No.

1031
01:16:59,270 --> 01:17:01,560
不要
Noooo!

1032
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:15,160
他去哪了
Where'd he go?

1033
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,430
- 我們回來了 - 好朋友
- We're back. - Bestie.

1034
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:26,480
我還是綠的 沒用啊
I'm still green. It didn't work!

1035
01:17:26,490 --> 01:17:29,000
噢等等 這是我正常時的綠色
Oh wait, that's my normal green.

1036
01:17:29,010 --> 01:17:32,460
- 綠娃娃 - 我不是娃娃 不是娃娃
- Greeny baby - Not a baby, not a baby!

1037
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,110
我是令人畏懼的螳螂
Antenna of Fear.

1038
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:35,340
阿寶呢
What about Po?

1039
01:17:35,370 --> 01:17:38,560
- 你看到阿寶了嗎 - 沒有 他不在這嗎
- Have you seen Po? - No, he's not here?

1040
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:41,380
阿寶 阿寶
Po? Po?

1041
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:43,710
他怎麼沒回來
Why isn't he back?

1042
01:17:53,780 --> 01:17:58,370
- 神龍大俠 - 烏龜 哇
- Dragon warrior. - Oogway? Whoaaa.

1043
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:03,140
我不敢相信
I can't believe it.

1044
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:06,580
- 哇 你格外耀眼 - 你也是
- Whoa, you're extra shiny. - As are you.

1045
01:18:06,610 --> 01:18:08,670
是吧 簡直是史上最好的披風
I know, right? It's like the best cape ever.

1046
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:11,050
當我披著它奔跑時 看起來超酷的
When I run with it, then it looks really cool.

1047
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:13,400
披風很適合你 你長大了
It suits you. You've grown.

1048
01:18:13,410 --> 01:18:15,700
是啊 我不能再吃熊貓大餐了
- Yeah, I gotta lay off the panda buffet.

1049
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:17,390
我是說你變成熟了
- Grown up.

1050
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:22,290
當我把消息傳給你父親時 我就期待你能變成這樣
As I hoped you would when I sent the message to your father.

1051
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,150
啊
Huh.

1052
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:26,180
原來那條宇宙消息是你發的啊 哇
You sent the universe mail? Whoa!

1053
01:18:26,210 --> 01:18:30,350
是的 因為宇宙需要你
Yes, because the universe needed you.

1054
01:18:30,370 --> 01:18:31,780
我嗎
Me?

1055
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:37,140
你終於變成了自己命中注定的樣子
You finally became the panda you were always meant to be.

1056
01:18:37,150 --> 01:18:39,410
但你怎麼知道我能做到
But how'd you know I could?

1057
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:41,740
我們初次見面的那一天
On the first day we met...

1058
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:46,210
我看到了功夫的未來
I saw the future of kung fu.

1059
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:50,390
也看到了過往
And the past.

1060
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:56,570
我看到了那只能將兩者合二為一的熊貓
I saw the panda who could unite them both.

1061
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:59,730
這就是我選你的原因 阿寶
That is why I chose you, Po.

1062
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:03,660
你結合了陰陽兩極
Both sides of the Yin and Yang.

1063
01:19:03,850 --> 01:19:07,680
