00:01:25,567 --> 00:01:27,778
The Obyamywe Peninsula,

2
00:01:27,861 --> 00:01:32,366
a remote and fascinating region
teeming with extraordinary marine life.

3
00:01:32,991 --> 00:01:37,245
We chose its mysterious waters as
the Belafonte's next destination.

4
00:01:37,663 --> 00:01:40,499
ln preparation for our voyage,
the members of Team Zissou

5
00:01:40,582 --> 00:01:44,795
gathered at my oceanographic
observatory here on Pescespada lsland.

6
00:01:44,878 --> 00:01:48,006
This was to be our most
ambitious adventure to date,

7
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,009
and ultimately a tragic one.

8
00:01:51,093 --> 00:01:54,596
Our team included Esteban
du Plantier, chief diver.

9
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,266
Our senior statesman, my
closest colleague for 27 years.

10
00:01:58,392 --> 00:02:01,061
Klaus Daimler, 40, engineer.

11
00:02:01,144 --> 00:02:03,271
Calm, collected, German.

12
00:02:03,355 --> 00:02:07,025
Vikram Ray, 28, cameraman.
Born on the Ganges.

13
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,695
Bobby Ogata, 22, frogman.

14
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,073

00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,298
vice-president of the Zissou Society.

20
00:02:29,423 --> 00:02:33,427
We'd also invited marine science students
from the University of North Alaska

21
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,347
to accompany us as unpaid interns
in exchange for school credit.

22
00:02:39,516 --> 00:02:45,105
October 12th. Esteban and l explore
the blue reefs beyond the peninsula.

23
00:02:47,274 --> 00:02:50,319
Fluorescent snapper unexpectedly
appear in the shallows,

24
00:02:50,402 --> 00:02:52,195
extremely rare at this depth.

25
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,251
Where's your gun?

26
00:03:06,376 --> 00:03:09,671
Steve? Steve? Where's Esteban?

27
00:03:09,755 --> 00:03:11,089
ls that thing rolling, Vikram?

28
00:03:21,642 --> 00:03:24,728
Check the scanning monitor. Start
tracking it before it goes too deep!

29
00:03:24,811 --> 00:03:27,105
- Esteban was bitten?
- Eaten!

30
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:28,857
ls he dead?

31
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:31,485
- Esteban was eaten.
- He was swallowed whole?

32
00:03:31,568 --> 00:03:36,114
No! Chewed. Check the scanning monitor!

33
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,534
He's got hydrogen
psychosis, ''crazy eye''.

34
00:03:39,618 --> 00:03:42,079
Steve, we think you got crazy eye.

35
00:03:42,204 --> 00:03:43,830
Get him out of the fucking water.

36
00:03:43,914 --> 00:03:45,165
Esteban!

37
00:03:45,249 --> 00:03:48,168
Esteban! Esteban!

38
00:03:48,252 --> 00:03:49,169
Esteban!

39
00:03:49,294 --> 00:03:50,295
Esteban!

40
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:52,839
- Steve!
- Esteban!

41
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:54,216
Esteban!

42
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:55,592
Esteban!

43
00:03:55,676 --> 00:03:58,220
Esteban!

44
00:04:10,607 --> 00:04:15,737
Was it a deliberate choice
never to show the jaguar shark?

45
00:04:15,862 --> 00:04:17,573
No, l dropped the camera.

46
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:25,372
Why are they laughing?

47
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:32,337
Yes. What's next for Team Zissou?

48
00:04:32,421 --> 00:04:36,091
Well, that was only part
one. lt's a cliffhanger.

49
00:04:36,174 --> 00:04:40,095
Now l'm gonna go hunt down
that shark, or whatever it is,

50
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,890
and, hopefully, kill it.

51
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:45,893
l don't know how yet. Maybe dynamite.

52
00:04:46,685 --> 00:04:48,478
You don't know what it is?

53
00:04:48,562 --> 00:04:50,856
No, l've never seen anything
like it before in my life.

54
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:53,901
You say it is a jaguar shark.
That's the title of your film.

55
00:04:53,984 --> 00:04:57,070
lt was coming right at us. l just said
the first two words that came into my head.

56
00:05:00,407 --> 00:05:02,784
That's an endangered species at most.

57
00:05:02,868 --> 00:05:07,122
What would be the scientific
purpose of killing it?

58
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,043
Revenge.

59
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:23,680
Bravo! What fun.

60
00:05:23,764 --> 00:05:25,599
Steve, l'd like to introduce
you to Antonia Cook.

61
00:05:25,682 --> 00:05:28,310
She's the new head of the film society.

62
00:05:28,393 --> 00:05:32,314
- You must be so excited.
- l hope so. You think it went OK?

63
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:35,776
No. Congratulations, seriously.

64
00:05:35,859 --> 00:05:40,364
Thanks. l wish it didn't require
the ''seriously'', but thank you.

65
00:05:40,447 --> 00:05:43,617
Well, l just don't think they got it.

66
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,619
- Steve...
- Shit turnout tonight.

67
00:05:45,702 --> 00:05:47,913
..you know Larry Amin,
chairman of Saudifilm.

68
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:49,039
Oh, yeah. Hi.

69
00:05:49,122 --> 00:05:51,250
Larry and l were discussing
our financial predicament.

70
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:54,586
l thought it would be nice if the three
of us rode out to the party together.

71
00:05:54,711 --> 00:05:57,089
Why? Does Larry have that kind
of spending bread to invest?

72
00:05:57,214 --> 00:06:00,384
- The king's backing him now.
- l got $500 million capitalisation from him.

73
00:06:00,467 --> 00:06:02,594
Captain Zissou, can l get a shot
of you with Captain Hennessey?

74
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:04,680
Where?

75
00:06:07,683 --> 00:06:09,351
Make it quick.

76
00:06:09,434 --> 00:06:11,562
Hey, Steven. How's
everything going with your...

77
00:06:11,687 --> 00:06:13,605
What are you calling it? Leopard fish?

78
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:17,359
- Jaguar shark.
- Jaguar shark, exactly.

79
00:06:17,484 --> 00:06:21,822
l love it. Tell me something,
does it actually exist?

80
00:06:21,905 --> 00:06:24,700
You know, Ali, l don't want
to give away the ending.

81
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:26,869
Good man.

82
00:06:26,952 --> 00:06:29,496
Oh, here comes our girl.

83
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:35,961
You're the most ravishing creature
that l've ever seen in my life.

84
00:06:36,044 --> 00:06:37,421
- Hello, skinny.
- Hello, Eleanor.

85
00:06:37,504 --> 00:06:39,548
ls that a new merit badge?

86
00:06:39,673 --> 00:06:41,175
Yeah, as a matter of fact, it is.

87
00:06:41,258 --> 00:06:45,387
l just became a knight in Portugal.
The presidente gave a special ball...

88
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:49,141
Don't be nice to Ali. He's my nemesis.

89
00:06:49,224 --> 00:06:51,143
How could you lay that slick faggot?

90
00:06:51,226 --> 00:06:53,896
Well, l was in love
with him at the time.

91
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:57,065
Yeah, he's charismatic.

92
00:06:57,149 --> 00:06:59,943
- How are you feeling?
- l'm right on the edge.

93
00:07:00,027 --> 00:07:01,987
l don't know what comes next.

94
00:07:02,112 --> 00:07:04,239
Wait here. l'll be right back.

95
00:07:08,243 --> 00:07:11,205
l just wanted to say hello. Hi.

96
00:07:11,288 --> 00:07:13,248
Hey, baby.

97
00:07:14,124 --> 00:07:19,087
l said l wanted to say hello. l
didn't say l wanted you to touch me.

98
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:21,840
l'm here with my wife.
Eleanor, this is Mandeeza.

99
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:24,676
Do we really want to
put me through this?

100
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,390
People say Eleanor is the
brains behind Team Zissou.

101
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,726
What is Steve?

102
00:07:33,852 --> 00:07:36,146
He's the Zissou.

103
00:07:43,904 --> 00:07:47,157
Steve, this is my little nephew Werner.

104
00:07:47,241 --> 00:07:49,368
He wanted to meet you.

105
00:07:49,451 --> 00:07:53,288
- How you doing, Werner?
- He brought you a present.

106
00:07:55,124 --> 00:07:57,209
A crayon pony fish.

107
00:07:57,292 --> 00:07:59,294
Wow.

108
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:01,922
lnteresting specimen.

109
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:06,385
- Thanks, pal.
- You're welcome.

110
00:08:06,468 --> 00:08:08,929
Steve...

111
00:08:09,054 --> 00:08:11,723
you don't look too good.

112
00:08:12,766 --> 00:08:14,560
How's this?

113
00:08:14,643 --> 00:08:17,855
Steve, there's a bloke over
there wants a word with you.

114
00:08:17,938 --> 00:08:19,022
What do you need, old man?

115
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,169
How many of these do you have?

116
00:08:41,044 --> 00:08:45,507
All right, look, just forge the
rest of 'em yourself, all right?

117
00:08:47,676 --> 00:08:49,678
Get outta here.

118
00:09:09,948 --> 00:09:14,036
Hey, Steve, how come you're not
sitting shivah for your friend Esteban?

119
00:09:16,246 --> 00:09:18,207
What'd you say?

120
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,002
Who you gonna kill in part two?

121
00:09:26,924 --> 00:09:28,300
Steve.

122
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:21,603
Larry Amin's flying back to Mecca tonight,
to see if he can make the numbers work.

123
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,606
He should have an answer
for us in ten days.

124
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,317
Tell him we need to know by Sunday.

125
00:10:27,401 --> 00:10:28,944
Why would l do that, my darling?

126
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:32,865
To call his bluff, dammit,
to light a fire under his ass.

127
00:10:32,948 --> 00:10:35,868
My darling, we haven't made a
hit documentary in nine years.

128
00:10:35,951 --> 00:10:37,786
Let's not fuck with Larry Amin.

129
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,955
- Doubles.
- Explain it to him, will you, Eleanor?

130
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,540
- Screwdriver.
- He understands.

131
00:10:41,623 --> 00:10:44,084
Amin needs to make a
projection of the world grosses

132
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:48,047
to see if he can get a tax break
and run it through his output deal.

133
00:10:48,172 --> 00:10:51,383
l don't understand, but
l can tell it's bullshit.

134
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:53,344
Oh, what the hell is going on?

135
00:10:53,427 --> 00:10:55,554
Play the black jack on the red queen.

136
00:10:58,265 --> 00:11:00,976
Well, if you'll excuse me, l'm
gonna go on an overnight drunk,

137
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:05,189
and in ten days l'm gonna set out to find
the shark that ate my friend and destroy it.

138
00:11:05,272 --> 00:11:08,275
Anyone that would care to
join me is more than welcome.

139
00:11:12,154 --> 00:11:15,199
Captain Zissou, l'm sorry to
bother you. l'm Ned Plimpton.

140
00:11:15,282 --> 00:11:17,576
OK, man.

141
00:11:17,701 --> 00:11:20,245
My mother's Katherine Plimpton.

142
00:11:23,957 --> 00:11:26,794
- You're kidding.
- No.

143
00:11:26,877 --> 00:11:29,755
- How is she?
- She died last month.

144
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,385
l'm sorry. Shit.

145
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:37,179
She was...

146
00:11:42,893 --> 00:11:44,853
l've heard of you.

147
00:11:53,487 --> 00:11:56,240
l don't know if it's true
or not, by the way. Do you?

148
00:11:56,323 --> 00:11:58,617
No, l don't.

149
00:11:58,742 --> 00:12:01,662
l haven't heard from her in 30 years.

150
00:12:03,372 --> 00:12:05,749
l guess it's too late now.

151
00:12:08,335 --> 00:12:11,839
She never contacted me, you know.

152
00:12:11,922 --> 00:12:13,882
Yes, l see.

153
00:12:17,553 --> 00:12:22,016
- You're supposed to be my son, right?
- l don't know.

154
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:25,227
But l did want to
meet you, just in case.

155
00:12:27,021 --> 00:12:28,981
l appreciate that.

156
00:12:35,863 --> 00:12:39,241
l'll be right back. Don't go away?

157
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:35,756
Sorry about that. You caught me with
one foot off the merry-go-round tonight.

158
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,592
Oh, that's all right. l don't
wanna take up too much of your time.

159
00:13:38,676 --> 00:13:41,053
l wanna thank you for
talking to me and...

160
00:13:41,136 --> 00:13:43,347
- We'll find a way, mate.
- l know we will.

161
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,058
l just had a lovely
chat with Si Perlman.

162
00:13:46,141 --> 00:13:49,061
He wants to make a big to-do of
the Oceanographic Explorer article,

163
00:13:49,144 --> 00:13:50,563
possibly give you the front cover,

164
00:13:50,646 --> 00:13:53,440
so do be nice to this girl Miss
Winslett-Richardson, won't you?

165
00:13:53,524 --> 00:13:58,487
Apparently she worships you,
and we dearly need the press.

166
00:13:58,612 --> 00:14:02,199
Oseary, this is probably
my son Ned. We just met.

167
00:14:02,324 --> 00:14:04,451
Ah. Oh, how delightful.

168
00:14:04,535 --> 00:14:06,287
Hello.

169
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:10,291
Anyway, his mother just died.
Plus, we're having some problems.

170
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:14,169
l just think it'd be a very special
opportunity for all of us, especially him.

171
00:14:14,295 --> 00:14:16,755
- He needs this deal.
- OK, bring him over.

172
00:14:16,881 --> 00:14:18,841
Well, he's right here.

173
00:14:23,345 --> 00:14:25,472
l'm sorry. How do you do?

174
00:14:29,894 --> 00:14:33,647
- So what do you do?
- l'm a pilot. Air Kentucky.

175
00:14:35,191 --> 00:14:37,651
- Air Kentucky.
- Copilot, actually.

176
00:14:37,735 --> 00:14:40,529
- Yeah, l don't know that one.
- We hub out of Louisville.

177
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:44,783
Sure, there's some pretty country
in those parts. Landlocked.

178
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:51,165
l have to tell you, l've been a member
of the Zissou Society since l was 11.

179
00:14:51,248 --> 00:14:53,626
Well, l'll be damned. Look at that.

180
00:14:55,878 --> 00:14:58,797
- Wanna kill this?
- Frankly, l'd better not.

181
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:01,675
l don't usually try grass.

182
00:15:07,681 --> 00:15:10,059
Let me tell you about my boat.

183
00:15:16,273 --> 00:15:19,860
The Belafonte was a long-range
subhunter during the Second World War,

184
00:15:19,944 --> 00:15:23,447
which we bought from the
U.S. Navy for $900,000.

185
00:15:23,572 --> 00:15:28,160
This is my mentor, Lord
Mandrake. He's dead now.

186
00:15:29,453 --> 00:15:33,374
The sauna was designed by an engineer
from the Chinese space program,

187
00:15:33,457 --> 00:15:37,503
and we keep a Swedish masseuse on staff.

188
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:43,425
Here's where we do all our science
projects and experiments and so on.

189
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,511
This is the kitchen,
which contains probably

190
00:15:45,594 --> 00:15:49,765
some of the most technologically
advanced equipment on the ship.

191
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:53,435
Eleanor put together a topnotch
research library for us,

192
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,399
with a complete first-edition set
of The Life Aquatic Companion Series.

193
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,985
We process our own rushes and
keep a cutting room on board

194
00:16:01,068 --> 00:16:03,028
so we can do an assembly
while we're shooting.

195
00:16:03,112 --> 00:16:06,157
- l can't find them.
- Once again, please.

196
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:14,039
This is the observation bubble, which
l thought up in a dream, actually.

197
00:16:14,165 --> 00:16:16,458
Two albino scouts swim with the ship.

198
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:21,672
They're supposedly very intelligent,
although l've never seen evidence of it.

199
00:16:21,755 --> 00:16:24,592
Here's the engine room. The bearing
casings aren't supposed to look like that,

200
00:16:24,675 --> 00:16:27,970
but we can't afford
to fix 'em this year.

201
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:30,764
Topside we've got the bridge,
the minisub, an old chopper

202
00:16:30,848 --> 00:16:35,102
and all kinds of radar and sonar
and underwater movie gadgets.

203
00:16:35,186 --> 00:16:38,189
What happened to ''Jacqueline''?

204
00:16:38,272 --> 00:16:40,816
She didn't really love me.

205
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,580
Lord Mandrake.

206
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,668
lt's wonderful. Very lifelike.

207
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,754
l'm not crazy about it.

208
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:11,305
This guy's a big-time asshole.
We were roommates at the academy.

209
00:17:11,388 --> 00:17:14,141
He used to be married to Eleanor.

210
00:17:14,225 --> 00:17:16,769
He hogs up all the grant money.

211
00:17:16,894 --> 00:17:19,980
You think you'll want
to change your name?

212
00:17:20,064 --> 00:17:21,065
Ned?

213
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,317
No, not the Ned part,
unless you want to.

214
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:28,739
l meant your last name. l thought you
might like to let me give you mine.

215
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,535
- Ned Zissou?
- Ned Zissou. Exactly.

216
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,829
Or if you want to, you can
change the first part, too.

217
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:38,290
l would have named you
Kingsley if l'd had a say in it.

218
00:17:38,374 --> 00:17:40,084
Kingsley.

219
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:43,921
l don't know. Maybe l'll
stick with Ned for now.

220
00:17:44,046 --> 00:17:45,381
Sure. That's OK.

221
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:49,885
Anyway, l'll order you
some correspondence stock.

222
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:52,012
What are you doing? l ordered the wine.

223
00:17:52,096 --> 00:17:55,850
Pour it over here, please. He
doesn't know anything about wine.

224
00:18:03,274 --> 00:18:05,151
Are those assholes talking about me?

225
00:18:22,084 --> 00:18:24,378
People say, when someone says
something like that about you

226
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,797
it's because they're jealous.

227
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:30,551
But it still hurts. lt hurts bad.

228
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:34,722
That man was damn rude.
He can go straight to hell.

229
00:18:51,155 --> 00:18:54,241
How did she die, by
the way, your mother?

230
00:18:55,284 --> 00:18:59,038
She took her own life.
She took sleeping pills.

231
00:19:00,081 --> 00:19:02,875
Why would she do that?

232
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:07,046
Well, she was in a great
deal of pain, you know.

233
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,883
l see, yeah.

234
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:16,389
You know, my best friend
just got killed. Esteban.

235
00:19:16,514 --> 00:19:17,973
Yeah, l know.

236
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:20,059
The old man.

237
00:19:22,978 --> 00:19:25,523
Let's go to my island.

238
00:19:25,606 --> 00:19:27,149
Well, l...

239
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:29,985
l have to be back in
Kentucky on Thursday.

240
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:32,738
Thursday? OK.

241
00:19:32,822 --> 00:19:34,699
That's OK.

242
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:14,155
Your cat's dead.

243
00:20:14,238 --> 00:20:16,782
- What? Which one?
- Marmalade.

244
00:20:16,907 --> 00:20:18,868
l'm sorry.

245
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,245
What happened?

246
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:24,206
A rattlesnake bit it in the throat.

247
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,793
Goddammit, Eleanor, why do
you have to say it like that?

248
00:20:27,918 --> 00:20:31,756
You couldn't try to break
it a little bit nicer?

249
00:20:36,844 --> 00:20:40,598
She's a rich bitch, you
know. She was raised by maids.

250
00:20:40,681 --> 00:20:45,478
Her parents paid for this island
and two of my worst movies.

251
00:20:46,896 --> 00:20:50,983
People say she's the
brains behind Team Zissou.

252
00:20:51,067 --> 00:20:54,904
People say a lot of things.
What kind of cat was it?

253
00:20:55,905 --> 00:20:59,492
Who gives a shit? l
think it was a tabby.

254
00:20:59,575 --> 00:21:03,329
Ned? Wanna come inside,
we'll make up a room for you?

255
00:21:03,412 --> 00:21:05,873
Steve, that reporter called.

256
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:26,102
Ned, wake up. l'm on the echo
box. Push the red button to answer.

257
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:28,187
Throw on your slob and meet
me on the beach in 12 minutes.

258
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,356
The white button? OK.

259
00:21:34,068 --> 00:21:35,528
Action!

260
00:21:35,611 --> 00:21:40,366
Only twice before have l had the good
fortune to observe a ''rubber tide'',

261
00:21:40,449 --> 00:21:42,994
that rare occurrence when
hundreds of electric jellyfish

262
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:45,955
spontaneously wash onto
a beachhead at once.

263
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:50,918
Bobby Ogata brings exactly
this to our attention tonight.

264
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:56,507
Steve, what produces this
effect of illumination?

265
00:21:56,632 --> 00:22:00,011
ls there a chemical inside the organism?

266
00:22:01,178 --> 00:22:05,433
No, Ned. Actually, it's the reflection
of the moonlight on their outer membranes.

267
00:22:08,311 --> 00:22:11,314
That's a very good ad lib.

268
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:13,608
Klaus, come over here and
get a two-shot of me and Ned.

269
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:15,401
Ned, come in here.

270
00:22:19,947 --> 00:22:22,074
Would you like to join my crew?

271
00:22:23,117 --> 00:22:26,454
- Would l like to...
- l want you on Team Zissou.

272
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:29,582
- l don't think l can do that.
- Why not?

273
00:22:29,665 --> 00:22:33,085
Well, it's not my field. l
don't have the background for it.

274
00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:36,589
No one here does. Klaus
used to be a bus driver.

275
00:22:36,714 --> 00:22:39,258
Wolodarsky was a high-school
substitute teacher.

276
00:22:39,342 --> 00:22:41,552
We're a pack of strays.
Don't you get it?

277
00:22:41,636 --> 00:22:45,056
Steve, l'm not even
that strong a swimmer.

278
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:51,145
- The answer's yes.
- Well, it's got to be.

279
00:22:51,228 --> 00:22:53,022
l'll order you a red cap and a Speedo.

280
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,816
Cut. Klaus, why aren't you rolling?

281
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,693
Could l have a word with you, please?

282
00:22:58,277 --> 00:23:00,488
Why aren't you getting this?

283
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:05,660
That was a goddamn tearjerker.
Why did you cut it, man?

284
00:23:05,743 --> 00:23:07,787
Because the sound is going to be shit.

285
00:23:07,912 --> 00:23:10,748
He doesn't even know how to hold a boom.

286
00:23:10,831 --> 00:23:13,459
He doesn't know diddly-jack
about what we're doing.

287
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:16,462
Don't cut unless l say cut.

288
00:23:16,545 --> 00:23:20,466
l've never seen so many electric
jellyfish in all my life.

289
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:22,551
Those are Vietcong
man-of-wars.

290
00:23:32,103 --> 00:23:34,146
Oh, shit, she's right.

291
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,857
l guess we'll have to loop that line.

292
00:23:36,941 --> 00:23:38,818
Where'd you come from?
You look pregnant.

293
00:23:38,901 --> 00:23:40,152
l am pregnant.

294
00:23:40,278 --> 00:23:42,405
l'm not even going to ask
what you men are doing out here

295
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,407
in your matching pyjamas, by the way.

296
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:48,327
We're producing a film, as a
matter of fact. Who are you?

297
00:23:48,452 --> 00:23:50,830
l'm Jane Winslett-Richardson.

298
00:23:50,955 --> 00:23:53,082
l'm the reporter from the
Oceanographic Explorer.

299
00:23:53,207 --> 00:23:55,084
Oh, yeah, sure. How'd you get out here?

300
00:23:55,209 --> 00:23:57,336
l hired some drunk in a fishing boat.

301
00:23:57,461 --> 00:24:00,756
That would take four hours.
Why would you do that?

302
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,093
Because no one picked me
up at the effing airport.

303
00:24:04,218 --> 00:24:05,678
Jesus Christ, Klaus.

304
00:24:05,761 --> 00:24:08,472
One of my guys was supposed to do that.

305
00:24:08,556 --> 00:24:11,267
How long have you been
working with Zissou?

306
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,811
Uh, approximately...

307
00:24:13,936 --> 00:24:16,772
Only ten minutes, actually. l was
hired during the scene on the beach.

308
00:24:16,856 --> 00:24:19,901
- He's Steve's son, supposedly.
- You are?

309
00:24:19,984 --> 00:24:21,944
No, you're not. He doesn't have one.

310
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:24,155
Well, we're not 100%
sure about that yet.

311
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,741
We just met yesterday.

312
00:24:27,825 --> 00:24:30,786
Not this one, Klaus.

313
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:37,376
You heard me. Not this one.

314
00:24:37,501 --> 00:24:39,128
OK.

315
00:24:39,212 --> 00:24:41,214
- First thing in the morning, huh?
- Just print everything?

316
00:24:41,297 --> 00:24:44,717
- Yeah, tell him to push it a stop and a half.
- OK.

317
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,304
What are you gonna do with him?

318
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:51,140
Who? Ned?

319
00:24:51,224 --> 00:24:53,226
What do you mean?

320
00:24:54,852 --> 00:24:57,647
l don't understand the question.

321
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:05,154
l offered him a spot on the Belafonte.

322
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,157
He didn't take it, did he?

323
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:10,034
Of course he took it.

324
00:25:10,117 --> 00:25:12,578
We're gonna put him on the map, Eleanor.

325
00:25:12,662 --> 00:25:15,206
We're gonna throw him a life preserver.

326
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:18,000
- l believe in this boy.
- Why?

327
00:25:22,296 --> 00:25:24,423
Because he looks up to me.

328
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:28,803
Yes, sir, and McKinnon's willing
to take over my shuttle flights.

329
00:25:28,886 --> 00:25:30,847
That's right.

330
00:25:34,642 --> 00:25:38,771
Well, l just feel l need to
see this thing through, sir.

331
00:25:40,273 --> 00:25:44,777
Thank you for understanding. l'll check in
with the Louisville office again next month.

332
00:25:46,863 --> 00:25:50,283
''..as l have not, as they
say, enough power of observation

333
00:25:50,408 --> 00:25:52,368
to isolate their sense of colour.''

334
00:25:52,493 --> 00:25:55,746
''For a long time afterwards,
whenever l thought of her,

335
00:25:55,830 --> 00:26:02,587
the memory of those bright eyes would at
once present itself to me as a vivid azure.''

336
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:05,923
''So much so that perhaps if her
eyes had not been quite so black,

337
00:26:06,007 --> 00:26:09,051
which was what struck one most
forcibly on first meeting her,

338
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:11,262
l should not have been, as l was,

339
00:26:11,387 --> 00:26:14,474
so especially enamoured
of their imagined blue.''

340
00:26:19,896 --> 00:26:21,147
Hold it.

341
00:26:25,026 --> 00:26:28,863
- That's poetry? - No,
it's a six-volume novel.

342
00:26:28,946 --> 00:26:31,908
Oh, so you're gonna read that
whole thing to yourself out loud.

343
00:26:31,991 --> 00:26:35,328
l'm not reading it to
myself, l'm reading it to him.

344
00:26:38,498 --> 00:26:40,875
When did you learn
Zissou was your father?

345
00:26:42,585 --> 00:26:44,504
Does it freak you out
for me to ask that?

346
00:26:44,587 --> 00:26:48,007
No, it doesn't, but it's
a difficult question.

347
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:50,301
l sort of pieced it
together over the years.

348
00:26:50,426 --> 00:26:52,804
Well, how did he first contact you?

349
00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:56,849
He didn't. l went looking for him
last month after my mother died.

350
00:26:56,933 --> 00:27:00,686
She had ovarian cancer, then it
spread to her stomach and liver,

351
00:27:00,812 --> 00:27:02,522
and she took her own life.

352
00:27:05,274 --> 00:27:08,778
- Well, good night, l guess.
- Oh, good night.

353
00:27:09,737 --> 00:27:12,949
You mind if l stay and
listen for a little while?

354
00:27:15,243 --> 00:27:16,786
OK.

355
00:27:23,751 --> 00:27:26,295
Do you want me to catch
you up on the story?

356
00:27:26,421 --> 00:27:29,257
No, l'll be able to figure it out.

357
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,717
l'll just catch as catch can.

358
00:27:34,971 --> 00:27:38,224
They made these for about...
three and a half years

359
00:27:38,349 --> 00:27:40,560
before they terminated my sponsorship.

360
00:27:49,652 --> 00:27:51,154
These are great.

361
00:27:51,237 --> 00:27:53,698
- May l turn this on?
- Fire one.

362
00:27:56,492 --> 00:28:02,248
- So what happened, in your opinion?
- What are you talking about?

363
00:28:02,331 --> 00:28:06,252
Don't you think public perception of your
work has altered in the last five years?

364
00:28:06,335 --> 00:28:09,422
That's your first question? l thought
this was supposed to be a puff piece.

365
00:28:09,881 --> 00:28:12,592
- Should we come back to it?
- Yeah.

366
00:28:12,675 --> 00:28:14,343
OK.

367
00:28:15,094 --> 00:28:18,598
ls it true that this is
going to be your last voyage?

368
00:28:19,265 --> 00:28:21,309
Wow. No comment.

369
00:28:22,226 --> 00:28:24,771
Who told you that?

370
00:28:24,896 --> 00:28:27,940
No, goddammit. l'm only 52.

371
00:28:28,024 --> 00:28:30,860
How about we start out
with some stock dialogue?

372
00:28:30,943 --> 00:28:34,614
You know, favourite colour...
blue. Favourite food... sardines.

373
00:28:34,697 --> 00:28:37,241
How do you feel about
part one of your new film?

374
00:28:38,534 --> 00:28:40,995
Why? How do you feel about
part one of my new film?

375
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:44,040
- Well, l'm honest, you know, so...
- Just say it.

376
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:48,920
l thought aspects of
it seemed slightly fake.

377
00:28:50,588 --> 00:28:51,506
Wolodarsky.

378
00:28:51,631 --> 00:28:54,842
- l'll take five, Steve.
- How about taking five?

379
00:28:56,719 --> 00:29:02,475
Did it seem fake when my best friend
was bitten in half right in front of me,

380
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:04,769
then eaten alive, screaming?

381
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,814
l think you're a fake.

382
00:29:07,939 --> 00:29:11,693
And l think you're a
phony and a bad reporter.

383
00:29:11,818 --> 00:29:15,655
How does that feel?
Now tell me something...

384
00:29:15,738 --> 00:29:18,366
Does this seem fake?

385
00:29:18,449 --> 00:29:20,993
How dare you!

386
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:24,956
This entire article was my
idea. No one else gives a shit.

387
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:27,959
What about Si Perlman?

388
00:29:28,042 --> 00:29:30,920
Are you joking? He's not
even covering my expenses.

389
00:29:34,048 --> 00:29:36,092
You're taking something out on me.

390
00:29:44,976 --> 00:29:48,396
Stop crying. What's the deal here?

391
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:50,732
l was only trying to defend myself.

392
00:29:50,815 --> 00:29:53,026
Well, you did a great job.

393
00:29:53,693 --> 00:29:56,237
l'm sure you'll make a terrific father.

394
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:06,414
So... you really think you're a Zissou?

395
00:30:08,624 --> 00:30:10,251
l don't know.

396
00:30:10,335 --> 00:30:14,172
You travelled a long way
for ''l don't know'', sonny.

397
00:30:14,255 --> 00:30:18,009
That's true, but it's important to me.

398
00:30:18,134 --> 00:30:22,930
Ja. well, there are a lot of things that
are important to people around here, sonny.

399
00:30:23,056 --> 00:30:25,933
- Klaus, don't call me sonny.
- One more thing.

400
00:30:26,017 --> 00:30:29,437
lt's the Steve Zissou
show, not the Ned show.

401
00:30:32,523 --> 00:30:36,027
- You hear me?
- Yes, l do.

402
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:38,613
Klaus!

403
00:30:38,696 --> 00:30:39,781
Ja?

404
00:30:39,906 --> 00:30:42,200
lf you ever touch me again,

405
00:30:42,325 --> 00:30:46,245
l will kick your goddamned
teeth out, is that understood?

406
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:50,792
Not if l don't see you first, sonny.

407
00:31:00,843 --> 00:31:03,638
We gotta watch ourselves
around this Jane character.

408
00:31:03,721 --> 00:31:05,682
Don't tell her anything personal.

409
00:31:05,807 --> 00:31:10,144
lf you're not sure about something,
change the subject and look for me.

410
00:31:10,228 --> 00:31:14,065
This bull dyke's got
something against us.

411
00:31:14,148 --> 00:31:17,151
l don't think she's a
lesbian. She's pregnant.

412
00:31:17,235 --> 00:31:19,779
Bull dykes can get pregnant.

413
00:31:19,904 --> 00:31:23,658
Anyway, l'd back out now,
but we need the press.

414
00:31:23,783 --> 00:31:25,785
See you in the morning.

415
00:31:26,703 --> 00:31:28,037
Steve?

416
00:31:30,415 --> 00:31:33,376
When'd you first hear about me?

417
00:31:35,295 --> 00:31:40,174
About five years ago. l read
it in an article about myself.

418
00:31:41,092 --> 00:31:43,303
Did you believe it?

419
00:31:44,178 --> 00:31:48,099
lt was in the paper. l assumed
they... checked their facts.

420
00:31:51,144 --> 00:31:53,896
Why didn't you contact me?

421
00:31:56,232 --> 00:32:00,445
Because l hate fathers, and
l never wanted to be one.

422
00:32:08,703 --> 00:32:12,373
l forgot. Your
correspondence stock came in.

423
00:32:20,089 --> 00:32:22,383
Hi, Ross. Started today.

424
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:26,721
l'll forward some pages to you
through the copy department.

425
00:32:28,222 --> 00:32:32,560
You're probably right, though.

426
00:32:32,644 --> 00:32:35,396
What am l doing here?

427
00:32:36,356 --> 00:32:38,900
l miss you and...

428
00:32:38,983 --> 00:32:41,778
Oh, God, l don't know, Ross.

429
00:32:41,861 --> 00:32:43,988
Where are you?

430
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:50,161
Listen, l'm not leaving this message.

431
00:32:51,162 --> 00:32:53,623
Don't even know why l'm still pregnant.

432
00:33:02,548 --> 00:33:06,052
The script girl uses
these for continuity.

433
00:33:06,135 --> 00:33:07,929
- Here.
- Oh, no, no, no.

434
00:33:08,012 --> 00:33:10,223
No exceptions. Everyone gets one.

435
00:33:10,348 --> 00:33:13,935
Anne-Marie, do the interns get Glocks?

436
00:33:14,936 --> 00:33:17,397
No, they all share one.

437
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,691
Take it, Ned.

438
00:33:19,774 --> 00:33:21,568
- Steve!
- What?

439
00:33:21,651 --> 00:33:23,861
Whack on the echo box.

440
00:33:25,697 --> 00:33:30,660
- Zissou here.
- Oseary Drakoulias on line two.

441
00:33:31,661 --> 00:33:32,579
Yeah?

442
00:33:32,704 --> 00:33:36,457
l spoke with Larry
Amin, and it's a pass.

443
00:33:36,541 --> 00:33:39,252
ln other words, you fucked us.

444
00:33:39,335 --> 00:33:42,297
Let's not cast stones
at one another, my boy.

445
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:45,049
- Do you hear me, dammit? Do you?
- No, l don't!

446
00:33:45,133 --> 00:33:47,927
- l told you how to play it!
- Bloody hell. Listen here, mate...

447
00:33:48,011 --> 00:33:50,388
May l interrupt for a moment?

448
00:33:51,389 --> 00:33:54,893
- Who the blazes is that?
- lt's me, Ned.

449
00:33:55,018 --> 00:33:57,478
Maybe this is nothing,
maybe it's something.

450
00:33:57,604 --> 00:34:01,608
l don't know your
problems. l don't know...

451
00:34:01,691 --> 00:34:05,278
But l just inherited $ 275,000.

452
00:34:05,361 --> 00:34:08,198
Would that amount make any difference?

453
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,243
What sort of expression is
the lad wearing on his face?

454
00:34:12,744 --> 00:34:14,787
Can you fly a chopper?

455
00:34:14,913 --> 00:34:18,917
l have, but l'm certainly not
licensed in any way, shape or form.

456
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,377
Great. Let's go.

457
00:34:29,636 --> 00:34:31,679
When was this whirlybird last serviced?

458
00:34:31,763 --> 00:34:35,266
l don't know. Klaus is supposed
to check it every six months.

459
00:34:43,107 --> 00:34:47,278
You're back on the water, boys. The
wire transfer came through from Kentucky,

460
00:34:47,362 --> 00:34:50,490
and Jackman and Wordsley are
going to gap-finance the rest.

461
00:34:50,573 --> 00:34:55,036
But we have a few hooks on
it, so take a pew for a spell.

462
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,498
Number one, the bank want a drug
screen for everyone on the crew

463
00:34:58,581 --> 00:34:59,833
before they'll forward the money.

464
00:34:59,958 --> 00:35:02,252
- A piss test?
- Yes, a piss test.

465
00:35:02,335 --> 00:35:04,629
Two, a stooge from the bond company

466
00:35:04,712 --> 00:35:08,633
will be riding everywhere during the
whole shoot to keep you on budget.

467
00:35:08,716 --> 00:35:11,594
- Who's the stooge?
- A chap by the name of Bill Ubell.

468
00:35:11,678 --> 00:35:14,055
And there's not a damn thing
you can do about that, Steve.

469
00:35:14,138 --> 00:35:16,808
Three, you must swear, legally swear,

470
00:35:16,891 --> 00:35:19,435
that you'll not kill that
shark, or whatever it is,

471
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:21,396
if it actually exists.

472
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:26,484
l'm going to fight it,
but l'll let it live.

473
00:35:26,568 --> 00:35:29,237
- What about my dynamite?
- Phillip, dynamite.

474
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,448
l'm off to Zurich. Follow me, chaps.

475
00:35:32,532 --> 00:35:37,579
Mr Ubell, l'd like for you to know
Steve Zissou and our equity partner Ned.

476
00:35:45,461 --> 00:35:49,465
l hope you're not gonna
bust our chops, Bill.

477
00:35:49,549 --> 00:35:55,263
- Why would l do that? - Because
you're a bond-company stooge.

478
00:35:55,346 --> 00:35:57,724
Well, l'm also a human being.

479
00:35:59,017 --> 00:36:01,144
All right, l take that back.

480
00:36:01,227 --> 00:36:02,687
Yeah.

481
00:36:03,688 --> 00:36:06,232
Let's have some teamsmanship.

482
00:36:10,236 --> 00:36:12,280
Ho!

483
00:37:44,414 --> 00:37:45,498
1, 2, 3.

484
00:37:45,582 --> 00:37:47,584
Come on.

485
00:37:53,631 --> 00:37:55,216
1, 2, 3.

486
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,676
Attaboy. Attaboy.

487
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,970
Here he is. Here he is. Come on.

488
00:37:59,053 --> 00:38:01,097
You OK, Ned? You OK?

489
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,184
All right, give him some room. He's OK.

490
00:38:04,267 --> 00:38:07,312
He just drank a little too much water.

491
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:13,193
How are you shooting
this, Vikram? Wide open?

492
00:38:13,276 --> 00:38:15,278
Light, 5/6.

493
00:38:27,665 --> 00:38:30,460
As always, even in the most
challenging circumstances,

494
00:38:30,543 --> 00:38:34,839
the members of Team Zissou
find ways to keep morale high.

495
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:41,054
Wait. Hold it.

496
00:38:41,137 --> 00:38:43,139
ls that a distress bark?

497
00:38:47,185 --> 00:38:49,145
ls something wounded out there?

498
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:53,650
We quickly locate the
source of the mysterious cry.

499
00:38:55,735 --> 00:38:59,322
- What is she, Steve?
- A wild snow mongoose.

500
00:38:59,447 --> 00:39:02,534
We thought they were
extinct. Her ankle's broken.

501
00:39:02,617 --> 00:39:03,993
- Ogata?
- Yeah.

502
00:39:04,077 --> 00:39:07,414
Run and get some hot milk and
put these guys in the incubator.

503
00:39:07,497 --> 00:39:12,210
We radio for the emergency transport
of our rare beautiful new friends.

504
00:39:14,796 --> 00:39:17,340
That's what it used to be like.

505
00:39:29,894 --> 00:39:34,941
Had Ned's heart stopped beating
before you pulled him out of the water?

506
00:39:35,066 --> 00:39:39,279
Had Ned's heart stopped beating
before we pulled him out of the water?

507
00:39:39,362 --> 00:39:43,033
Yes. But we got him started
again pretty quickly.

508
00:39:43,158 --> 00:39:46,119
Don't go on this
voyage right now, Steve.

509
00:39:46,202 --> 00:39:48,663
One of you is already dead, after all.

510
00:39:48,788 --> 00:39:50,290
Who?

511
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:54,294
Oh, you mean Esteban?

512
00:39:54,377 --> 00:39:56,838
Thanks for bringing that up.

513
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,511
Who's gonna tell us the Latin names
of all the fishes and everything?

514
00:40:03,595 --> 00:40:05,805
You know l can't remember all that shit.

515
00:40:05,889 --> 00:40:08,350
Please stop, Eleanor. Eleanor, stop.

516
00:40:08,433 --> 00:40:09,768
Why are you leaving?

517
00:40:09,851 --> 00:40:12,604
l don't want to be a part of
whatever's gonna happen out there.

518
00:40:12,687 --> 00:40:14,981
Nobody knows what's going to
happen, and then we film it.

519
00:40:15,065 --> 00:40:18,401
- That's the whole concept.
- That's how we've always done it.

520
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:21,613
l can't believe you
took that boy's money.

521
00:40:21,696 --> 00:40:23,657
He's an investor.

522
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:26,368
He's my sidekick.

523
00:40:26,993 --> 00:40:29,287
The sugar crabs are back.

524
00:40:31,206 --> 00:40:33,333
They're early this year.

525
00:40:33,416 --> 00:40:36,753
l've never seen them
mating before the solstice.

526
00:40:36,878 --> 00:40:39,422
ls that mating?

527
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:47,639
Goodbye, Steve.

528
00:40:49,265 --> 00:40:53,103
Don't say that. Even if
it's true... don't say that.

529
00:40:53,228 --> 00:40:56,815
- lt's too painful.
- What do you want me to say?

530
00:40:59,025 --> 00:41:00,986
Say bon voyage.

531
00:41:05,615 --> 00:41:07,617
Bon voyage.

532
00:41:46,197 --> 00:41:48,158
Kingsley Ned Zissou, 29,

533
00:41:48,283 --> 00:41:50,744
junior-grade diving
tech, executive producer.

534
00:41:50,869 --> 00:41:52,996
Energetic, spirited, youthful.

535
00:41:55,832 --> 00:42:00,545
Normally we would track the jaguar
shark with the scanning monitor,

536
00:42:00,629 --> 00:42:04,549
but its power tubes have
seized up and blown a gasket.

537
00:42:05,675 --> 00:42:11,264
We proceed to the more advanced system
located on a colleague's offshore facility.

538
00:42:13,308 --> 00:42:16,394
This will be Team Zissou's next stop.

539
00:42:21,733 --> 00:42:25,403
See, Renzo, this is what l'm talking about
- a relationship subplot.

540
00:42:25,487 --> 00:42:28,615
There's chemistry between us, you know?

541
00:42:31,493 --> 00:42:33,370
- Here's a quote.
- Wait. Who from?

542
00:42:33,495 --> 00:42:37,082
''Zissou has an almost magical
connection to the life of the sea.''

543
00:42:37,165 --> 00:42:42,837
''He speaks its language fluently. l've
never met a boy like that in all my life.''

544
00:42:42,921 --> 00:42:46,258
- Lord Mandrake.
- You should have opened with that one.

545
00:42:46,341 --> 00:42:50,512
- He was your mentor.
- Hey, intern, get me a Campari, will ya?

546
00:42:50,595 --> 00:42:53,306
On the rocks?

547
00:42:54,391 --> 00:42:56,434
You wanna go up in my balloon?

548
00:42:59,271 --> 00:43:03,984
- l like her hairdo.
- Me too, but Steve called it first.

549
00:43:07,821 --> 00:43:11,575
- l'm sorry l made you cry the other day.
- Oh.

550
00:43:11,658 --> 00:43:14,578
That's OK. lt's not
completely your fault anyway.

551
00:43:14,661 --> 00:43:17,205
l'm going through
some personal problems.

552
00:43:17,289 --> 00:43:19,332
Really? What do you got?

553
00:43:19,457 --> 00:43:23,295
Well, l'm... five months
pregnant. My editor's the father.

554
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:27,465
He's married, but... not to me.

555
00:43:27,549 --> 00:43:30,594
Wow. That's a rough ticket.

556
00:43:30,677 --> 00:43:34,514
You know, my first wife
left me when l was your age.

557
00:43:37,309 --> 00:43:40,061
- What's Deep Search?
- My submarine.

558
00:43:42,898 --> 00:43:47,611
l had this image of you on the wall above
my aquarium all through primary school.

559
00:43:47,694 --> 00:43:52,490
Oh, yeah? You mean the official
photograph, where l'm doing this?

560
00:43:52,574 --> 00:43:55,243
That's the one.

561
00:43:55,327 --> 00:43:59,164
Well, maybe it's just me, but
l don't feel like that person.

562
00:43:59,289 --> 00:44:01,416
l never did.

563
00:44:14,638 --> 00:44:16,932
Why did you abandon Ned?

564
00:44:18,975 --> 00:44:21,686
l didn't. l never even met him.

565
00:44:24,814 --> 00:44:28,235
What kind of piece are
you writing, cubbie?

566
00:44:28,693 --> 00:44:30,654
Are you gonna screw us on this deal?

567
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:34,866
l hope not.

568
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:46,628
You really think it's cool to hit the
sauce when you got a bun in the oven?

569
00:44:46,711 --> 00:44:48,922
Pele, bring us back down, please.

570
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:56,847
l don't have a problem
with objective reporting.

571
00:44:56,930 --> 00:45:00,141
What l have a problem with is
some wombat coming on my boat,

572
00:45:00,225 --> 00:45:06,231
trying to railroad me. Why don't you
see if you can get one of these dolphins

573
00:45:06,314 --> 00:45:09,651
to swim under the hull
and give us a look.

574
00:45:18,076 --> 00:45:22,122
Nah. Either they can't hear
us, or they don't understand.

575
00:45:23,623 --> 00:45:26,626
Son of a bitch. l'm
sick of these dolphins.

576
00:45:29,129 --> 00:45:31,506
Quiet out there tonight.

577
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:35,594
Can you hear the jack whales singing?

578
00:45:35,677 --> 00:45:38,430
Beautiful. l wonder what they're saying.

579
00:45:38,513 --> 00:45:41,600
That was the sludge tanker, but...

580
00:45:41,683 --> 00:45:44,436
There you go. That's them.

581
00:45:47,898 --> 00:45:52,694
By the way, would you mind if l made a few
modifications to the Team Zissou insignia?

582
00:45:52,777 --> 00:45:54,905
- l have some ideas.
- You mean the patch?

583
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:57,157
Yes. The insignia.

584
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,452
Yeah. lt's probably
kind of dated, isn't it?

585
00:46:00,535 --> 00:46:03,538
Sure. Take a crack at it.
Make it a little trendier.

586
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:07,918
All right.

587
00:46:09,711 --> 00:46:15,175
Are you finding what you were
looking for out here with me?

588
00:46:15,258 --> 00:46:17,469
l hope so.

589
00:46:19,095 --> 00:46:21,890
l wrote you a letter about 17 years ago.

590
00:46:23,683 --> 00:46:26,561
You mean like a fan letter?

591
00:46:27,521 --> 00:46:29,731
Did l write you back?

592
00:46:29,856 --> 00:46:32,943
l try to answer as many
personally as l can.

593
00:46:33,026 --> 00:46:37,030
''Dear Ned Plimpton, first, in answer to your question
- always.''

594
00:46:37,114 --> 00:46:40,367
''Second, thank you very much
for naming your bug after me.''

595
00:46:40,492 --> 00:46:43,328
''My wife tells me it is
actually a type of gnat.''

596
00:46:43,411 --> 00:46:47,791
''You strike me as a very special boy
and a key member of the Zissou Society.''

597
00:46:47,874 --> 00:46:52,170
''l wish l could come visit you in
Kentucky and assist you with your work.''

598
00:46:52,254 --> 00:46:56,007
''l remember your mother. Take
care of yourself, Ned Plimpton.''

599
00:46:56,091 --> 00:46:59,511
''You've served well. Your
friend, Captain Steve Zissou.''

600
00:46:59,636 --> 00:47:02,097
''Dictated but not read.''

601
00:47:05,517 --> 00:47:08,937
Yeah, more or less standard
boilerplate, l guess.

602
00:47:11,231 --> 00:47:14,734
There's some real high-tech gear
inside this deal, believe me.

603
00:47:14,818 --> 00:47:19,614
First we turn on that tracking system, then
as long as the batteries haven't gone...

604
00:47:19,739 --> 00:47:23,076
- Who locked us out?
- No one. We're trespassing.

605
00:47:23,201 --> 00:47:27,289
- Steve, are we allowed in here?
- lt's a scientific community, man.

606
00:47:27,372 --> 00:47:31,918
Captain, l am required by law to notify
the bank of any illegal activities.

607
00:47:32,043 --> 00:47:34,796
Just do what you gotta do
to cover your ass, Bill.

608
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,840
Got it.

609
00:47:44,014 --> 00:47:47,684
Fuck! They wired it. Klaus, go
down and get me some cable snippers.

610
00:47:47,809 --> 00:47:51,730
This is Captain Hennessey. You have
trespassed on a private facility.

611
00:47:51,813 --> 00:47:54,191
The Coast Guard is being alerted.

612
00:47:54,274 --> 00:47:57,486
Again, this is Captain
Hennessey. lmmediately leave...

613
00:48:01,114 --> 00:48:04,451
OK, action. Well, look
who's back in town.

614
00:48:04,534 --> 00:48:07,871
You travelled over 150 miles
since we last heard from you.

615
00:48:07,954 --> 00:48:10,082
lt's heading for the South Pacific.

616
00:48:11,333 --> 00:48:12,667
Turn on your tape recorder.

617
00:48:12,751 --> 00:48:16,129
- ls it the jaguar shark?
- On the record, yes.

618
00:48:16,213 --> 00:48:18,882
Cut. Print both takes, Vikram.

619
00:48:18,965 --> 00:48:23,095
- Was l just in the film?
- Yeah. You have to sign a release.

620
00:48:23,178 --> 00:48:25,555
But you've actually located the shark.

621
00:48:25,639 --> 00:48:28,683
You better bet your ass we
did. All right, everybody,

622
00:48:28,767 --> 00:48:32,521
we got about 25-30 minutes before the
Coast Guard gets here to arrest us.

623
00:48:32,604 --> 00:48:36,525
l want you all to get Hennessey's
best gear onto the Belafonte in 15.

624
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:40,070
- You're gonna steal his stuff?
- We'll get it back to him. lnterns,

625
00:48:40,153 --> 00:48:42,197
let's see some hustle.

626
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,825
Uh, what is this, Pele?

627
00:48:45,826 --> 00:48:47,828
l don't know. Uh, it's a map.

628
00:48:47,911 --> 00:48:50,288
Steve.

629
00:48:50,414 --> 00:48:54,084
Do you know you just charted us on
a course through unprotected waters?

630
00:48:54,167 --> 00:48:58,422
- Yeah, we're taking the shortcut.
- But it's outside lMU jurisdiction.

631
00:48:58,505 --> 00:49:00,507
l know, honey. Look at the map.

632
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:05,804
We go your way, that's about... 4 inches.
We go my way, it's an inch and a half.

633
00:49:05,929 --> 00:49:09,516
- You wanna pay for the extra gas?
- What kind of system is this?

634
00:49:09,641 --> 00:49:12,561
You have the Bernstein 9.
Just upgraded last summer.

635
00:49:12,644 --> 00:49:16,231
- The nines are out already?
- Does this do cappuccino?

636
00:49:16,314 --> 00:49:18,692
- Ja.
- Wait. This isn't the procedure.

637
00:49:21,695 --> 00:49:25,282
One of the interns just fell down the
stairs with the tracking processor.

638
00:49:25,365 --> 00:49:29,453
- Make sure we steal the backup.
- You listening? Under no circumstances...

639
00:49:29,536 --> 00:49:32,247
Shut up before you jinx us, Anne-Marie.

640
00:49:46,928 --> 00:49:49,306
You catching anything?

641
00:49:53,101 --> 00:49:55,479
Hook this up and make me a latte.

642
00:50:01,109 --> 00:50:04,196
You know, Cubbie's
kind of a suckermaker,

643
00:50:04,279 --> 00:50:06,948
but she's got some moves.

644
00:50:07,032 --> 00:50:09,242
l agree.

645
00:50:09,326 --> 00:50:14,206
lf she wasn't a bull dyke, l think l
might have a bit of a thing for her.

646
00:50:26,551 --> 00:50:31,181
As you can see, if the creature
continues its current migratory route,

647
00:50:31,306 --> 00:50:33,934
our paths should converge
in less than four days.

648
00:50:34,017 --> 00:50:38,689
- l wanna get there in three. Can we?
- Vladimir, what's this blip here?

649
00:50:38,772 --> 00:50:42,109
l don't know. We might
have them mixed up.

650
00:50:42,192 --> 00:50:46,697
lt could be the other way around. Anyway,
we're gonna be on top of it in the morning.

651
00:50:50,075 --> 00:50:55,038
- Good eye, Ned.
- Thank you. Should we investigate it?

652
00:50:55,163 --> 00:50:58,667
Yeah. Let's make a dive at 6am,
scope out the phantom signal.

653
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:03,964
lt's probably one of Hennessey's turtles.
l wanna be back on the road by lunch.

654
00:51:07,592 --> 00:51:11,179
Do me a favour. Next time you get
a hot idea in front of the reporter,

655
00:51:11,263 --> 00:51:13,390
whisper it in my ear first.

656
00:51:13,473 --> 00:51:16,601
Otherwise l look like kind of
a daydream Johnny, you know?

657
00:51:16,685 --> 00:51:19,229
Daydream Johnny, yes.

658
00:51:19,354 --> 00:51:21,231
You let him change your name?

659
00:51:21,732 --> 00:51:25,402
- Well, we changed it together.
- What was it before?

660
00:51:25,485 --> 00:51:28,238
- Edward Plimpton.
- That's a million times better.

661
00:51:28,322 --> 00:51:32,618
Change it back, Ned. l really
don't see you as a Kingsley Zissou.

662
00:51:32,701 --> 00:51:36,705
Do you think Steve and l
have a family resemblance?

663
00:51:36,788 --> 00:51:38,999
No.

664
00:51:39,082 --> 00:51:41,627
l guess it doesn't really matter anyway.

665
00:51:47,758 --> 00:51:49,885
Here.

666
00:51:49,968 --> 00:51:55,182
l stole it back... and strung it
on some peppermint dental floss

667
00:51:55,307 --> 00:51:58,310
in case you want to
wear it like a necklace.

668
00:52:19,289 --> 00:52:22,459
- Happy with the piece, Jane?
- What are you doing in here?

669
00:52:22,542 --> 00:52:24,920
Am l? No.

670
00:52:25,003 --> 00:52:27,965
- Put that down.
- l assume l'm Mr Z.

671
00:52:28,048 --> 00:52:34,304
l'm sorry that you think my red hat is,
uh... What's the word you use? ''Contrived.''

672
00:52:34,429 --> 00:52:36,473
And that...

673
00:52:36,556 --> 00:52:42,396
''The Zissou of my childhood represents
all the dreams l've come to regret''?

674
00:52:42,479 --> 00:52:46,900
- What? Why?
- l have to start locking my effing door.

675
00:52:46,984 --> 00:52:51,863
lt was locked. l kicked it in. Why
don't you just curse, like other people?

676
00:52:51,947 --> 00:52:55,450
l'm trying to get out of the habit
before l have my fucking baby.

677
00:52:55,576 --> 00:52:59,788
OK. That makes sense. Well,
please clean up your room, anyway.

678
00:52:59,871 --> 00:53:03,458
- lt looks like a goddamn typhoon hit it.
- Oh, get out.

679
00:53:10,424 --> 00:53:14,469
Please don't make fun of me. l
just wanted to flirt with you.

680
00:53:14,553 --> 00:53:17,264
l'll have an intern
come and fix the door.

681
00:53:30,611 --> 00:53:32,613
This is a message from
the lMU Coast Guard.

682
00:53:32,696 --> 00:53:36,533
Apparently some crooked fuckers
broke into my Sealab yesterday.

683
00:53:36,617 --> 00:53:38,744
How awful. Did they nick anything?

684
00:53:38,869 --> 00:53:43,498
lt doesn't say. Probably just trashed
the place. l'm so... pissed, l wanna spit.

685
00:53:43,582 --> 00:53:48,212
Hugo... Tell Carl to load my
elephant gun with buckshot.

686
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:52,841
We're gonna hunt down these sickos.

687
00:53:55,427 --> 00:53:58,305
Supposedly, Cousteau and
his cronies invented the idea

688
00:53:58,388 --> 00:54:00,766
of putting walkie-talkies
into the helmet,

689
00:54:00,849 --> 00:54:05,896
but we made ours with a special rabbit ear
on the top so we could pipe in some music.

690
00:54:52,109 --> 00:54:55,279
Let's start with the reverse.

691
00:55:04,955 --> 00:55:07,082
OK, roll it, Vikram.

692
00:55:08,917 --> 00:55:12,921
Would it be possible for me to
address you as ''Dad'' in this scene?

693
00:55:13,005 --> 00:55:15,215
No. Why?

694
00:55:16,967 --> 00:55:20,137
Oh, excuse me. l'm sorry.
l forgot. l'm sorry.

695
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:23,223
Where you coming from, jack-off? Shit.

696
00:55:24,099 --> 00:55:27,603
lt's not a bad impulse,
though, some kind of nickname.

697
00:55:28,645 --> 00:55:33,317
Not that one. lt's too specific.
But try to think of something else.

698
00:55:34,151 --> 00:55:36,695
Another name?

699
00:55:37,404 --> 00:55:39,865
How about ''Stevesie''?

700
00:55:39,948 --> 00:55:42,993
That's good. Try it. What
were you gonna say before?

701
00:55:46,121 --> 00:55:50,042
- Good luck, Stevesie.
- Fantastic. Let's go.

702
00:55:58,759 --> 00:56:01,053
OK, action.

703
00:56:06,975 --> 00:56:09,603
Look, Ned, there's a
sunken airplane down there.

704
00:56:09,686 --> 00:56:11,980
Let's check it out.

705
00:56:21,156 --> 00:56:27,079
We examine the site but are careful not
to disturb forensic evidence. How was that?

706
00:56:27,162 --> 00:56:29,790
Not bad. The first take
was a little faster.

707
00:56:30,916 --> 00:56:32,876
ls it loose?

708
00:56:33,001 --> 00:56:35,462
- Klaus. Klaus?
- Ja.

709
00:56:35,587 --> 00:56:38,048
May l have a word with you, please?

710
00:56:41,468 --> 00:56:43,137
What?

711
00:56:43,971 --> 00:56:46,181
- Why'd you do that?
- l owed you one.

712
00:56:46,306 --> 00:56:49,101
But you gave me a warning already.

713
00:56:49,184 --> 00:56:52,312
- You stood up for yourself.
- l still owed you one.

714
00:56:52,396 --> 00:56:55,899
- Now l owe you one.
- No. Now we're even.

715
00:56:56,024 --> 00:57:01,071
Why are you doing this? He's not my
father, you know. l don't have that.

716
00:57:01,196 --> 00:57:06,577
- What are you talkin' about?
- We're even, dammit. That's it!

717
00:57:26,054 --> 00:57:30,684
No, it was like a beat-up little
jalopy. l don't know what you'd call it.

718
00:57:30,809 --> 00:57:34,146
- You didn't see it?
- l didn't see it, boss.

719
00:57:34,229 --> 00:57:37,608
Well, keep your eyes peeled.

720
00:57:37,691 --> 00:57:40,778
Klaus, check who's on
watch. l'll be in the sauna.

721
00:57:42,029 --> 00:57:44,323
Pele and...

722
00:57:44,448 --> 00:57:47,242
Who the shit is Kingsley Zissou?

723
00:57:49,244 --> 00:57:51,622
- ls that him?
- That's him.

724
00:57:53,123 --> 00:57:56,627
l've never felt a baby in
someone's stomach before.

725
00:58:00,255 --> 00:58:03,467
l think you'll make a
very good single mother.

726
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,014
- Thanks.
- Although it does put you both

727
00:58:09,098 --> 00:58:11,475
at a tremendous disadvantage.

728
00:58:27,866 --> 00:58:30,244
You know...

729
00:58:30,369 --> 00:58:33,163
Steve's got a little
bit of a thing for you.

730
00:58:34,498 --> 00:58:36,625
Why do you say that?

731
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:38,877
Because he told me.

732
00:58:38,961 --> 00:58:40,462
Really?

733
00:58:40,546 --> 00:58:43,841
l thought he hated my guts.

734
00:58:43,924 --> 00:58:46,301
Well, l think you hurt
his feelings, but...

735
00:58:46,427 --> 00:58:48,637
He says l hurt his feelings?

736
00:58:51,265 --> 00:58:55,436
So... effed up.

737
00:59:27,259 --> 00:59:28,844
Five...

738
00:59:28,927 --> 00:59:30,596
four...

739
00:59:30,679 --> 00:59:32,348
three...

740
00:59:32,431 --> 00:59:34,099
two...

741
01:00:04,922 --> 01:00:06,173
Yeah?

742
01:00:06,298 --> 01:00:09,218
Steve, would you please open the door?

743
01:00:22,606 --> 01:00:26,360
Jane, is, uh, Ned in there?

744
01:00:29,571 --> 01:00:31,407
Stevesie?

745
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:34,994
Stevesie, what's happening?
Are those hijackers?!

746
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:38,038
Well, we call them
''pirates'' out here, Ned.

747
01:00:38,122 --> 01:00:40,499
You were supposed to
be on watch, by the way.

748
01:00:40,582 --> 01:00:44,586
Oh, my God, you're
right. Stevesie, look...

749
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:48,215
Whoa! No!

750
01:00:49,758 --> 01:00:52,136
So you were reading to
each other in French?

751
01:00:52,219 --> 01:00:54,680
No, it's in English. lt was translated.

752
01:00:54,805 --> 01:00:58,058
You're not supposed to go into
each other's cabins on a boat.

753
01:00:58,183 --> 01:01:02,104
- Why not?
- lt's just kind of an unwritten maritime rule

754
01:01:02,229 --> 01:01:04,231
when you're at sea.

755
01:01:04,315 --> 01:01:06,775
Especially the goddamn lookout.

756
01:01:06,859 --> 01:01:09,486
- l'm so sorry.
- So am l.

757
01:01:09,570 --> 01:01:11,864
You hung us out to dry.

758
01:01:13,949 --> 01:01:18,912
lf we don't handle this right,
we're gonna all get murdered,

759
01:01:19,038 --> 01:01:22,124
including her unborn British child.

760
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:31,425
l'm gonna kill you for that, asshole!

761
01:01:31,508 --> 01:01:35,721
l'm gonna hit you so fucking
hard, you'll be blind!

762
01:01:37,014 --> 01:01:39,308
Please don't hurt him!

763
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:45,397
Watch me. l'll let you
know when l'm gonna move.

764
01:01:45,481 --> 01:01:49,652
lt's safer to do what they say. They
probably just want our money and jewels.

765
01:01:49,735 --> 01:01:55,324
Yeah, then how am l gonna finish
my movie, then? Jesus. Holy fuck.

766
01:01:55,407 --> 01:01:59,787
- They're going to kill us, Steve.
- l'm patting you on the back now, Klausy.

767
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:04,833
Don't be scared. l'm gonna get us through
this, everybody. Ogata. Como esta. Pel?

768
01:02:08,504 --> 01:02:12,007
Wake up, Ned-o! l'm
sorry l yelled at you.

769
01:02:12,675 --> 01:02:16,679
l need to speak with the man in charge.

770
01:02:16,762 --> 01:02:22,726
Don't point that gun at him. He's an unpaid
intern. Vikram, what coverage you get?

771
01:02:22,810 --> 01:02:27,273
l kept rolling till
they put this hood on me.

772
01:02:28,357 --> 01:02:31,193
Bill speaks their language.
What are they saying?

773
01:02:31,277 --> 01:02:33,237
Hold on.

774
01:02:38,617 --> 01:02:42,621
OK. Apparently they're taking a
hostage. Obviously they've chosen Ned.

775
01:02:46,292 --> 01:02:51,505
Now that they've found out l speak Filipino,
they seem to be changing their minds.

776
01:02:56,302 --> 01:02:59,597
- Do you have a vault? They wanna know.
- There's no vault.

777
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:04,101
Our vault contains at least ten different
currencies from all over the world,

778
01:03:04,184 --> 01:03:08,772
and we are prepared for every
kind of financial necessity.

779
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:12,568
There goes Ned's inheritance.

780
01:03:12,651 --> 01:03:18,032
Tell them if they don't get off my boat right
now, there's gonna be a major shit storm.

781
01:03:30,252 --> 01:03:34,173
Ned-o, can you hear me?!
We'll get you back, Billy.

782
01:03:34,256 --> 01:03:36,926
ls everybody else safe?
Anne-Marie, are you OK?

783
01:03:37,009 --> 01:03:40,846
No, l'm not. l told you
these were unprotected waters.

784
01:03:40,930 --> 01:03:43,224
What a fuckin' nightmare.

785
01:03:46,227 --> 01:03:51,273
Be cool on this shit, OK, cubbie? l
mean, at least try to show both sides.

786
01:03:51,398 --> 01:03:54,109
l need to find a baby for this father.

787
01:03:54,652 --> 01:03:57,029
Yeah, l think l know what you mean.

788
01:04:13,963 --> 01:04:15,130
Here we go.

789
01:04:15,214 --> 01:04:19,927
- Steve... what are you...
- l said get your ass the hell off of my boat!

790
01:05:25,784 --> 01:05:29,830
l've never seen a bond-company
stooge stick his neck out like that.

791
01:05:39,215 --> 01:05:41,967
What's that sound? ls that...?

792
01:05:42,051 --> 01:05:45,012
The arctic night lights, yeah.

793
01:05:45,095 --> 01:05:50,142
''As if the natural world's been
turned upside down.'' Lord Mandrake.

794
01:05:54,772 --> 01:05:57,691
Vikram, get some
cutaways of this miracle.

795
01:05:57,775 --> 01:06:01,445
Klaus, Ogata, put out the
deck fires before we sink.

796
01:06:03,697 --> 01:06:08,327
Those fucking amateurs. You
left your dog, you idiots.

797
01:06:12,123 --> 01:06:16,418
Wrap this stiff in a tablecloth.
We're gonna bury him at sea.

798
01:06:16,502 --> 01:06:20,631
Shouldn't we give him to
the authorities or something?

799
01:06:20,714 --> 01:06:22,842
No.

800
01:06:22,925 --> 01:06:25,469
l'll write up a few
words to read over him.

801
01:06:26,512 --> 01:06:29,390
How you holding up
there, intern? Doing OK?

802
01:06:32,977 --> 01:06:36,313
Ned, how many fingers am l holding up?

803
01:06:36,439 --> 01:06:39,150
l don't know. That's not my job.

804
01:06:40,025 --> 01:06:44,989
- Too many to tell. How many fingers...
- He's gonna be just fine.

805
01:06:52,538 --> 01:06:58,169
l believe it's criminal that Steve allowed
this to happen to us, by which l mean illegal.

806
01:06:58,252 --> 01:07:03,883
We're being led on an illegal
suicide mission by a selfish maniac.

807
01:07:03,966 --> 01:07:08,012
l hear what you're saying, but
l think you misjudge the guy.

808
01:07:13,017 --> 01:07:15,770
Saint Paul said to the Corinthians:

809
01:07:15,853 --> 01:07:21,192
''Without kin, no man may regard
himself kindly. Without s...''

810
01:07:21,275 --> 01:07:23,486
Holy shit! Son of a bitch. Cut.

811
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:32,078
This is Captain Hennessey. We've come
in response to your distress signal...

812
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:36,874
Good God, is that you, Steven?

813
01:07:37,917 --> 01:07:41,504
Run downstairs, put a tarp over
anything that says ''Hennessey'' on it.

814
01:07:41,587 --> 01:07:45,591
- What about this guy?
- Just throw him over the other side.

815
01:07:51,138 --> 01:07:53,432
Your engine blew up and
your fuel's been stolen.

816
01:07:53,516 --> 01:07:55,059
Correct?

817
01:07:55,142 --> 01:08:00,356
l know how you feel. Some crooked
fuckers just stripped my Sealab, you know.

818
01:08:00,439 --> 01:08:03,859
Probably the same dudes.

819
01:08:03,943 --> 01:08:10,032
l can tow you as far as Port-au-Patois. l'll
need your signature on that invoice first.

820
01:08:10,116 --> 01:08:14,120
lt accounts for the expenses of the
rescue, my time and that of my crew.

821
01:08:14,203 --> 01:08:16,580
This is more than the
budget of my project.

822
01:08:16,664 --> 01:08:19,125
lt's an estimate.
What's your dog's name?

823
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:25,464
Cody.

824
01:08:29,468 --> 01:08:31,429
Be still, Cody.

825
01:08:36,559 --> 01:08:38,936
l have to run this by
my bond-company stooge.

826
01:08:39,019 --> 01:08:43,107
- He's been kidnapped.
- That's true. l have to rescue him first.

827
01:08:43,190 --> 01:08:45,901
Sign it now, or l'm
leaving you out here.

828
01:08:51,365 --> 01:08:54,618
Oh, l dined with Eleanor last weekend.

829
01:08:54,702 --> 01:08:59,206
By the way, she's summering at my villa
in West Port-au-Patois, don't you know?

830
01:08:59,290 --> 01:09:02,460
Say, how's Team Zissou
holding up without her?

831
01:09:11,844 --> 01:09:15,931
The first thing that goes through a
captain's head when there's low morale is:

832
01:09:16,015 --> 01:09:19,435
''What'd l do? ls it all my fault?''

833
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:23,773
Well, he's probably right. Most of
us have been together a long time.

834
01:09:23,856 --> 01:09:26,942
There are others that
were here before that.

835
01:09:27,026 --> 01:09:30,613
Do you all... not like me any more?

836
01:09:30,696 --> 01:09:34,825
l mean, what am l supposed
to do? l don't know.

837
01:09:34,909 --> 01:09:36,619
Look...

838
01:09:36,702 --> 01:09:41,165
if you're not against
me, don't cross this line.

839
01:09:41,248 --> 01:09:43,793
lf yes, do.

840
01:09:43,876 --> 01:09:46,003
l love you all.

841
01:09:50,883 --> 01:09:53,344
- Are you sure?
- Yes, l am.

842
01:09:53,469 --> 01:09:55,429
l don't understand. Why?

843
01:09:55,554 --> 01:09:57,848
What do you mean?

844
01:09:57,932 --> 01:10:01,435
Wait a second. What are we doing?
You said cross the line if...

845
01:10:01,519 --> 01:10:05,106
- Cross the line if you're going to quit.
- Oh...

846
01:10:05,231 --> 01:10:08,067
Do it again. l misunderstood.

847
01:10:16,409 --> 01:10:18,536
Hi, Ross. l got your
corrections on the proofs.

848
01:10:18,619 --> 01:10:22,832
They're fine, but...
l'm not coming back.

849
01:10:22,915 --> 01:10:25,459
lt's over. Please don't
try to contact me, OK?

850
01:10:25,543 --> 01:10:27,837
You'll hear from us... sometime.

851
01:10:32,174 --> 01:10:34,802
We got attacked by pirates.

852
01:10:34,885 --> 01:10:37,263
l feel as if life has...

853
01:10:40,516 --> 01:10:44,895
Well, you get the idea. Anyway,
take care of yourself. Jane.

854
01:10:45,479 --> 01:10:47,565
Will you write to me?

855
01:10:47,648 --> 01:10:51,152
Of course. Give me the address.

856
01:10:51,277 --> 01:10:55,906
Actually, l went ahead and stamped
and self-addressed 50 or so envelopes

857
01:10:56,032 --> 01:10:59,952
just to make it easier for you.

858
01:11:00,077 --> 01:11:02,622
Thanks. l'll use them.

859
01:11:02,705 --> 01:11:05,708
Each one has three
blank pages in it, and...

860
01:11:07,543 --> 01:11:10,338
there's a pen.

861
01:11:10,421 --> 01:11:14,342
Maybe l'm going to write
you a letter right now.

862
01:11:16,469 --> 01:11:18,304
OK.

863
01:11:27,188 --> 01:11:29,732
l bet l'm gonna really miss you, Ned.

864
01:11:31,984 --> 01:11:34,195
l'm gonna miss you, too.

865
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:37,448
ln fact, l feel like... l don't know,

866
01:11:37,531 --> 01:11:41,285
l feel like my heart's
almost getting broken.

867
01:11:41,410 --> 01:11:43,871
l guess l'm overreacting.

868
01:11:47,291 --> 01:11:49,585
ls that really true?

869
01:11:51,629 --> 01:11:53,631
Yes, it is.

870
01:11:55,091 --> 01:11:59,011
That was all off the record,
cubbie, that whole deal.

871
01:11:59,136 --> 01:12:02,390
Actually, l'm surprised you
didn't cross the line yourself.

872
01:12:02,515 --> 01:12:05,268
- What line?
- The line l drew on the deck just now.

873
01:12:05,351 --> 01:12:08,437
- You weren't up there?
- No.

874
01:12:08,521 --> 01:12:10,481
You're kidding.

875
01:12:10,606 --> 01:12:14,360
That was one of the most dramatic
things that's ever happened on this boat.

876
01:12:14,485 --> 01:12:18,948
l just lost all my best interns. l thought
you were supposed to be covering this.

877
01:12:19,031 --> 01:12:22,201
- You just said it was off the record.
- But you didn't know that.

878
01:12:22,285 --> 01:12:26,122
- l was down here packing.
- You're at the wrong breaker.

879
01:12:27,498 --> 01:12:30,459
So you are leaving.

880
01:12:31,168 --> 01:12:33,629
You're jumping ship on me.

881
01:12:33,713 --> 01:12:36,090
l'm going to scrap the article.

882
01:12:36,215 --> 01:12:39,885
You mean you're not even gonna
write the cover story on me?

883
01:12:40,011 --> 01:12:42,305
Man, l don't have any stature any more.

884
01:12:42,388 --> 01:12:46,434
Sorry, Steve. Everything just
got too weird, that's all.

885
01:12:46,517 --> 01:12:50,271
But l gave you a goddamn
show-stopper up there.

886
01:12:52,273 --> 01:12:54,817
Are you sleeping with Ned?

887
01:12:54,942 --> 01:12:58,779
- That's none of your business.
- OK. Are you?

888
01:12:58,905 --> 01:13:00,907
No, l'm not.

889
01:13:03,784 --> 01:13:08,039
You're gonna miss the jaguar shark or
whatever it is if it actually exists.

890
01:13:09,373 --> 01:13:11,375
Are you crying?

891
01:13:13,628 --> 01:13:16,380
You cry easily, don't you?

892
01:13:16,464 --> 01:13:20,301
Bloody hell, God save
that poor little stooge.

893
01:13:20,384 --> 01:13:22,929
This never would've happened
if Eleanor was with us.

894
01:13:23,012 --> 01:13:26,849
- Thanks, man.
- Your luck had better change soon, mate.

895
01:13:26,974 --> 01:13:29,769
Now l must away. l'll
send you a postcard.

896
01:13:29,852 --> 01:13:33,356
- What? Where are you going?
- Abroad for a spell, my darling.

897
01:13:33,481 --> 01:13:38,444
lt's my passport status, you see. l'm X-9
at the moment. Legally, l'm a fugitive.

898
01:13:38,528 --> 01:13:42,740
Wait a second. They stole
my budget, my boat's broken,

899
01:13:42,823 --> 01:13:46,953
you're ditchin' me up the creek.
What am l supposed to do here?

900
01:13:47,036 --> 01:13:49,413
Well, l must say,
nothing's jumping to mind.

901
01:13:49,539 --> 01:13:52,917
Phillip, any suggestions?
No, he's shaking his head.

902
01:13:54,418 --> 01:13:58,256
Land ho! Port-au-Patois,
dead ahead.

903
01:13:58,798 --> 01:14:03,177
Port-au-Patois.
Port-au-Patois ho!

904
01:14:03,261 --> 01:14:05,263
Ho!

905
01:14:05,638 --> 01:14:07,682
Ho!

906
01:14:07,765 --> 01:14:10,142
Land ho!

907
01:14:10,226 --> 01:14:11,853
Ho!

908
01:14:14,188 --> 01:14:18,860
No, l can't give you full credit,
but l'm not gonna flunk you, either.

909
01:14:18,943 --> 01:14:21,487
You're all getting ''incompletes''.

910
01:14:23,531 --> 01:14:26,200
This is bullshit.

911
01:14:59,984 --> 01:15:03,029
Oh, shit. What do you want?

912
01:15:03,112 --> 01:15:05,490
Do you mind if l butter
you up before l answer?

913
01:15:05,573 --> 01:15:08,493
Yes, l do. Tell me now.

914
01:15:09,702 --> 01:15:12,163
l need some money to
get the boat out of hock

915
01:15:12,288 --> 01:15:15,041
and rescue my bond-company
stooge who got kidnapped.

916
01:15:15,124 --> 01:15:18,252
Could we ask your
parents to loan it to me?

917
01:15:18,336 --> 01:15:20,087
No.

918
01:15:21,297 --> 01:15:23,174
OK.

919
01:15:24,175 --> 01:15:28,304
Could l butter you up anyway? lt took
me two and a half hours to get here.

920
01:15:31,766 --> 01:15:35,269
- Who's that dude?
- lt's my research assistant, Javier.

921
01:15:35,353 --> 01:15:38,105
Javier, te presento Steve.

922
01:15:39,357 --> 01:15:41,359
Steve.

923
01:15:46,072 --> 01:15:52,745
- Necesito cinco minutos.
- l'd be jealous about you staying at Ali's

924
01:15:52,829 --> 01:15:55,373
except l always thought
he was a closet queer.

925
01:15:57,125 --> 01:16:00,461
So how's your father-son
relationship coming along?

926
01:16:00,545 --> 01:16:04,841
Well, nobody has a real lock on any of
this, so l don't know how it all times out.

927
01:16:04,924 --> 01:16:08,427
l mean, l know l want him
to think of me like a father.

928
01:16:08,511 --> 01:16:10,721
But the fact that there's a chance

929
01:16:10,847 --> 01:16:15,643
that he could really be my
actual... biological son...

930
01:16:18,688 --> 01:16:21,065
..is very difficult for me.

931
01:16:27,488 --> 01:16:32,285
You know l'm not big on apologizing, so l'll
just skip it, if it's all the same to you.

932
01:16:32,410 --> 01:16:33,411
OK.

933
01:16:33,536 --> 01:16:35,830
But anyway, l'm sorry.

934
01:16:37,498 --> 01:16:41,252
l know l haven't been at
my best this past decade.

935
01:16:41,377 --> 01:16:43,087
That's true.

936
01:16:45,256 --> 01:16:48,134
What happened to me?

937
01:16:48,217 --> 01:16:51,179
Did l lose my talent?

938
01:16:51,262 --> 01:16:53,890
Am l ever gonna be good again?

939
01:16:55,016 --> 01:16:57,018
l don't know.

940
01:16:59,061 --> 01:17:03,441
Doesn't matter, anyway. lt's probably
the last adventure l've got in me.

941
01:17:03,524 --> 01:17:09,572
l was hoping to go out in a flash of blazes,
but l'll probably just end up going home.

942
01:17:09,655 --> 01:17:12,950
Unless you're planning
to sell the island.

943
01:17:13,034 --> 01:17:15,995
l wonder how much l could get for it.

944
01:17:16,079 --> 01:17:18,039
ln this market?

945
01:17:20,291 --> 01:17:24,670
You were probably right all along.
We should've had a kid together.

946
01:17:24,754 --> 01:17:28,800
Of course, you were kinda already...

947
01:17:28,883 --> 01:17:31,260
on the edge of being too old.

948
01:17:32,303 --> 01:17:34,597
Unless maybe that's a cop-out.

949
01:17:39,143 --> 01:17:41,854
lt's worse than a cop-out. l was 34.

950
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:49,320
lt's good to see you, Eleanor.

951
01:17:53,408 --> 01:17:55,410
l'm about to blow my stack.

952
01:17:55,493 --> 01:17:58,204
l turn my back, and the bullshit begins.

953
01:17:58,287 --> 01:18:00,331
Ned, you're a scumbag.

954
01:18:01,290 --> 01:18:03,835
And, Jane, you're a goddamn liar.

955
01:18:03,918 --> 01:18:05,962
What the fuck are you doing in here?

956
01:18:06,045 --> 01:18:08,423
What the F are you doing in here?

957
01:18:08,506 --> 01:18:12,677
l warned you about being in other people's
cabins. You were supposed to go home.

958
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:17,056
You convinced me to stay
and finish the story.

959
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:21,227
- ls it still the cover?
- l don't fucking know.

960
01:18:22,895 --> 01:18:26,315
Don't you dare put on that uniform.

961
01:18:26,899 --> 01:18:28,818
lt's all l have with me.

962
01:18:28,901 --> 01:18:33,031
l told you l have a bit of a thing
for her. ''Not this one,'' l said.

963
01:18:33,114 --> 01:18:36,159
You said, ''Not this one, Klaus.''

964
01:18:36,242 --> 01:18:39,537
- So you heard me?
- You're too old for me, Steve.

965
01:18:40,329 --> 01:18:44,709
- Well, you're pregnant.
- Can l have a word with you privately?

966
01:18:44,792 --> 01:18:46,586
Yes.

967
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:52,842
Follow me.

968
01:18:56,429 --> 01:19:00,016
- Are you two fighting?
- l'll deal with you later.

969
01:19:01,017 --> 01:19:03,561
Look, Steve, l know we both like her

970
01:19:03,686 --> 01:19:07,607
and you're angry and embarrassed,
but leave her out of it.

971
01:19:07,690 --> 01:19:12,487
You think that's what this is about? Shit,
what has that bull dyke been telling you?

972
01:19:12,612 --> 01:19:16,616
All right, l'm gonna warn
you now, be a gentleman.

973
01:19:16,699 --> 01:19:19,535
What are you doing here? l
thought you interns ran out.

974
01:19:19,619 --> 01:19:23,373
- l wanna help you find that shark.
- Goddammit. Thank you, intern.

975
01:19:23,498 --> 01:19:25,792
- You're gettin' an A.
- His name's Nico.

976
01:19:25,875 --> 01:19:28,002
- Who?
- Hello, Vikram.

977
01:19:28,086 --> 01:19:32,799
Gimme that camera. l'm gonna
smash it over your head.

978
01:19:32,882 --> 01:19:35,426
Cut!

979
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:39,555
l misread you, man. l'm gonna
have to rethink some shit.

980
01:19:39,639 --> 01:19:42,266
You don't know me. You
never wanted to know me.

981
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:45,603
l'm just a character in your film.

982
01:19:45,728 --> 01:19:49,148
lt's a documentary. lt's
all really happening.

983
01:19:49,273 --> 01:19:51,567
Well, damn you for that.

984
01:19:53,695 --> 01:19:56,072
Go to bed, you sons of bitches.

985
01:20:00,201 --> 01:20:03,246
That pregnant slut's been
playing us like a cheap fiddle.

986
01:20:03,329 --> 01:20:05,623
That's it. l'm gonna fight you, Steve.

987
01:20:08,292 --> 01:20:10,503
You never say, ''l'm gonna fight you.''

988
01:20:10,628 --> 01:20:14,048
You just smile and act natural,
and then you sucker-punch him.

989
01:20:14,132 --> 01:20:20,555
- You fight your way, and l'll fight mine.
- Oh, listen, Ned. Don't you try...

990
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:28,021
l think your Team Zissou ring
might've caught me on the lip.

991
01:20:30,815 --> 01:20:34,736
You call yourself my son, but...

992
01:20:34,861 --> 01:20:37,238
l just don't see it.

993
01:20:37,322 --> 01:20:40,283
lt's nothing personal.

994
01:20:40,366 --> 01:20:42,660
What do you want?

995
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:46,456
Nothing.

996
01:20:46,539 --> 01:20:51,169
That's so arrogant. That's... Screw off.

997
01:20:51,252 --> 01:20:54,589
l can't believe l asked if
l could call you ''Dad''.

998
01:20:54,672 --> 01:20:57,800
- Of course you said no.
- l let you call me Stevesie.

999
01:20:57,884 --> 01:21:00,178
lt sounds better.

1000
01:21:02,347 --> 01:21:04,807
lt doesn't mean the same thing.

1001
01:21:09,062 --> 01:21:11,689
A week before she killed
herself, my mother told me

1002
01:21:11,773 --> 01:21:15,777
that you'd known about me
since the day l was born.

1003
01:21:15,860 --> 01:21:18,071
ls that a fact?

1004
01:21:18,988 --> 01:21:21,783
That's a fact.

1005
01:21:21,866 --> 01:21:25,787
l ought to have stayed in
Kentucky where l belong.

1006
01:21:31,376 --> 01:21:34,128
Quiet.

1007
01:21:34,212 --> 01:21:37,048
Somebody pay for this water taxi.

1008
01:21:40,301 --> 01:21:42,303
You got any petty cash on you?

1009
01:21:44,847 --> 01:21:47,558
Remind me to send Eleanor's
parents a thank-you note

1010
01:21:47,642 --> 01:21:50,895
- on the good correspondence stock.
- OK.

1011
01:21:52,355 --> 01:21:54,649
This is the message we received earlier

1012
01:21:54,732 --> 01:21:58,569
on our answering machine
at Pescespada lsland.

1013
01:22:00,655 --> 01:22:02,615
Bill Ubell here. l'm on a payphone.

1014
01:22:02,699 --> 01:22:04,742
l am blindfolded and my arms are bound,

1015
01:22:04,867 --> 01:22:07,078
but a boy has been kind
enough to assist me,

1016
01:22:07,203 --> 01:22:10,123
and there's not much chance
l'll get another call,

1017
01:22:10,206 --> 01:22:14,043
so l thought l would ask if... What? No.

1018
01:22:18,673 --> 01:22:20,800
Well, thanks for checking in, Bill.

1019
01:22:20,925 --> 01:22:24,679
Next time, maybe you could
let us know where you're at.

1020
01:22:24,804 --> 01:22:29,684
Based on the quality of the connection,
the variety of wildlife in the background,

1021
01:22:29,809 --> 01:22:34,355
and the elapsed time between Mr
Ubell's capture and this message,

1022
01:22:34,439 --> 01:22:38,026
there's a good chance he's
on one of the Ping lslands.

1023
01:22:38,109 --> 01:22:41,613
There used to be a four-star
hotel on Little Ping.

1024
01:22:41,696 --> 01:22:45,283
But the entire island was destroyed
by a monsoon five years ago.

1025
01:22:45,408 --> 01:22:47,535
lt's been uninhabited ever since.

1026
01:22:47,619 --> 01:22:50,288
l know the place. Hotel Citroen.

1027
01:22:51,289 --> 01:22:55,293
Cubbie, l'd like to speak
on the record for a moment.

1028
01:22:55,376 --> 01:22:59,130
Eleanor has always been the
brains behind Team Zissou.

1029
01:22:59,255 --> 01:23:01,633
By the way, are you gonna
put in a good description

1030
01:23:01,758 --> 01:23:04,469
of the command centre
l've set up down here?

1031
01:23:07,388 --> 01:23:11,434
OK, gang, that's the plan. Set a course
for Ping lsland, full speed ahead.

1032
01:23:11,517 --> 01:23:16,064
You'll need to hire a team of mechanics
to rebuild the engine first, of course.

1033
01:23:16,147 --> 01:23:18,816
l know. l'm saying, after that.

1034
01:23:19,442 --> 01:23:21,736
Just because l've
decided to save your neck

1035
01:23:21,861 --> 01:23:25,073
and help you do this rescue
doesn't mean you've won me back.

1036
01:23:25,156 --> 01:23:27,283
Yes, ma'am.

1037
01:23:36,125 --> 01:23:38,169
Thanks.

1038
01:23:39,212 --> 01:23:42,966
ls the father out of the picture?

1039
01:23:43,049 --> 01:23:47,387
Actually, l was sort of
terrified about having this baby.

1040
01:23:47,470 --> 01:23:51,307
Right now, l'm not
really scared of anything.

1041
01:23:51,391 --> 01:23:55,395
- Maybe it's my hormones.
- That makes sense.

1042
01:23:57,188 --> 01:24:01,693
l'm gonna tell you something confidentially
which won't be mentioned again.

1043
01:24:01,776 --> 01:24:05,697
l'm pretty sure l'm the only person
who can say this, including Steve...

1044
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:08,449
Never mind how l found
out. l'm a scientist.

1045
01:24:08,533 --> 01:24:11,661
lt's the thing that puzzles
me about Ned's situation.

1046
01:24:11,744 --> 01:24:14,539
- What is it?
- Zissou shoots blanks.

1047
01:24:18,334 --> 01:24:22,755
l think maybe it's because he
spent half his life underwater.

1048
01:24:55,288 --> 01:24:58,291
Let's try track three against picture.

1049
01:25:04,297 --> 01:25:09,177
A reef surrounds the Ping lslands,
warning intruders to keep their distance.

1050
01:25:11,471 --> 01:25:14,724
Today, we discover one of its
victims off the coast of Ping 3.

1051
01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:22,190
Our colleague, Alistair Hennessey,
and his crew are nowhere to be found.

1052
01:25:22,315 --> 01:25:24,400
We will land at dawn.

1053
01:25:25,985 --> 01:25:27,695
Not bad.

1054
01:25:27,779 --> 01:25:29,989
We'll temp it with that, anyway.

1055
01:26:05,316 --> 01:26:07,610
All right, let's go.

1056
01:26:29,716 --> 01:26:31,551
Oh, shit. Swamp leeches.

1057
01:26:31,634 --> 01:26:34,637
Everybody check for swamp
leeches and pull 'em off.

1058
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:41,394
Nobody else got hit? What's the deal?

1059
01:26:44,564 --> 01:26:47,776
What a shame. They had
a bartender here, Keno,

1060
01:26:47,859 --> 01:26:51,613
made the best rum
Cannonball l've ever tasted.

1061
01:26:51,738 --> 01:26:54,115
You ready, Vikram?

1062
01:26:55,408 --> 01:26:58,828
- About six and a half.
- All right, shall we do this?

1063
01:27:22,727 --> 01:27:25,814
Barometer's falling. lt's
gonna rain. We gotta be quick.

1064
01:27:25,897 --> 01:27:28,191
- Where are they?
- Unknown. Split into groups.

1065
01:27:28,274 --> 01:27:30,735
l'll take Ned, Ogata, and Wolodarsky.

1066
01:27:30,860 --> 01:27:34,697
Thanks. Thanks a lot for not picking me.

1067
01:27:34,781 --> 01:27:38,535
What? We're smack in the middle of
a lightning-strike rescue op, Klaus.

1068
01:27:38,660 --> 01:27:41,204
- What's the deal?
- l'm sick of being on B squad.

1069
01:27:41,287 --> 01:27:45,917
Listen, you may be on B squad,
but you're the B squad leader.

1070
01:27:46,918 --> 01:27:51,214
Don't you know me and Esteban always
thought of you as our baby brother?

1071
01:27:51,297 --> 01:27:54,259
l've always thought
of you two as my dads.

1072
01:27:55,260 --> 01:27:58,680
Please don't let anyone
make fun of me for saying so.

1073
01:27:58,805 --> 01:28:03,351
l can't guarantee that, Klausy, but l'll
try. Can we get on with the manoeuvres now?

1074
01:28:04,144 --> 01:28:06,271
Wolodarsky, you got something?

1075
01:28:06,354 --> 01:28:08,398
Not yet.

1076
01:28:13,987 --> 01:28:16,031
Anybody see anybody?

1077
01:28:16,156 --> 01:28:18,033
Empty.

1078
01:28:22,287 --> 01:28:24,205
- Klaus, pirates?
- No.

1079
01:28:24,289 --> 01:28:26,750
l think this whole place is deserted.

1080
01:28:26,875 --> 01:28:29,502
Shit. We played a bum hunch.

1081
01:28:29,586 --> 01:28:34,716
Fuck. OK, let's not get down on ourselves.
We got two more Ping lslands to check out,

1082
01:28:34,799 --> 01:28:37,343
except l don't know if we
have enough gas to do it.

1083
01:28:37,427 --> 01:28:41,181
Dammit, Steve!

1084
01:28:41,264 --> 01:28:43,808
This sucks.

1085
01:28:43,892 --> 01:28:46,561
l'm disappointed in myself.

1086
01:28:52,442 --> 01:28:57,238
My first wife, Jacqueline,
and l spent our honeymoon here.

1087
01:28:58,615 --> 01:29:00,992
Things are pretty different now.

1088
01:29:03,912 --> 01:29:06,289
All right, let's check out.

1089
01:29:12,170 --> 01:29:14,255
Did you get that, Vikram?

1090
01:29:14,339 --> 01:29:15,507
Uh, yeah.

1091
01:29:15,590 --> 01:29:19,260
Good. We'll give them
the reality this time.

1092
01:29:19,344 --> 01:29:23,181
A washed-up old man with no
friends, no distribution deal,

1093
01:29:23,306 --> 01:29:25,975
wife on the rocks,
people laughing at him,

1094
01:29:26,059 --> 01:29:28,269
feeling sorry for himself.

1095
01:29:28,645 --> 01:29:32,315
Can l have a word alone
with my son, please?

1096
01:29:34,067 --> 01:29:37,153
- Are you all right?
- Not really.

1097
01:29:39,698 --> 01:29:45,870
By the way, l've been trying to think of
a nickname that might mean the right thing.

1098
01:29:45,996 --> 01:29:48,039
l came up with ''Papa Steve''.

1099
01:29:58,425 --> 01:30:03,471
l'm sorry l never acknowledged
your existence all those years.

1100
01:30:03,596 --> 01:30:06,057
lt won't happen again. l mean it.

1101
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:11,229
You are my son to me.

1102
01:30:11,354 --> 01:30:13,815
Almost more so.

1103
01:30:14,858 --> 01:30:19,362
See, for me to meet a guy like
you at this time in my life...

1104
01:30:20,572 --> 01:30:23,241
l don't know. Uh... it's just...

1105
01:30:24,242 --> 01:30:27,495
l wanna communicate my feelings to you,

1106
01:30:27,621 --> 01:30:31,625
but... l think l might start to cry.

1107
01:30:34,127 --> 01:30:37,881
That's OK.

1108
01:30:38,923 --> 01:30:41,134
There's something in the coat check.

1109
01:30:47,891 --> 01:30:50,435
Hey, Billy. You OK?

1110
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:54,606
- Did you get my message?
- Yeah. lt was kinda garbled.

1111
01:31:02,197 --> 01:31:03,865
Jesus.

1112
01:31:03,949 --> 01:31:06,242
These pirates are monsters.

1113
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:10,705
But remember, l shot one of their guys in
the neck last week and killed him, so...

1114
01:31:10,789 --> 01:31:13,083
l think we're OK, too.

1115
01:31:14,376 --> 01:31:15,460
Where's Cody?

1116
01:31:19,881 --> 01:31:21,883
Cody?

1117
01:31:36,690 --> 01:31:38,650
See you...

1118
01:31:40,068 --> 01:31:43,029
Steven, are you rescuing me?

1119
01:31:48,243 --> 01:31:50,203
Fold.

1120
01:32:05,218 --> 01:32:07,512
Klaus, bring the dynamite.

1121
01:32:22,903 --> 01:32:26,573
They were in there after
all! Run! Go! Move now!

1122
01:32:37,918 --> 01:32:41,338
Vikram got some great footage of
your boat. l guess it's totalled?

1123
01:32:41,463 --> 01:32:45,383
Perhaps. We're extremely well
insured. l'll probably come out ahead.

1124
01:32:45,467 --> 01:32:50,180
Although we'll obviously have to
crew up from scratch next time.

1125
01:32:50,263 --> 01:32:53,058
They made soup of my research turtles.

1126
01:33:02,817 --> 01:33:05,195
Ogata, give some first aid to Pele.

1127
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:07,864
Klausy, Ned-o.

1128
01:33:07,948 --> 01:33:11,535
Dig in and hold these rustlers
off while l call in the rendezvous.

1129
01:33:11,618 --> 01:33:13,119
We'll meet on the beach.

1130
01:33:14,621 --> 01:33:16,831
You're A squad.

1131
01:33:17,999 --> 01:33:21,169
Renzo, Renzo, Renzo.
Anybody, hello? Hello?

1132
01:33:21,253 --> 01:33:23,547
This gizmo's out of juice.

1133
01:33:26,591 --> 01:33:28,051
Thanks.

1134
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:34,015
No, Captain.

1135
01:33:34,099 --> 01:33:36,893
That's Cedric. He's a friend.

1136
01:33:38,144 --> 01:33:40,021
Merci. Cedric.

1137
01:33:40,146 --> 01:33:42,774
Remind me, we'll send him
a red cap and a Speedo.

1138
01:33:45,527 --> 01:33:49,531
Wolodarsky, go get the keys to that
fishing boat and throw them in the water.

1139
01:33:49,614 --> 01:33:53,368
No, wait. They might have
another set. Just blow it up.

1140
01:33:55,579 --> 01:33:56,997
Hey, Ned.

1141
01:33:57,080 --> 01:34:00,292
lt looks like we
recovered your inheritance.

1142
01:34:01,334 --> 01:34:02,502
Klausy.

1143
01:34:13,722 --> 01:34:16,433
That's it. l'm retired.

1144
01:34:30,822 --> 01:34:33,450
Oh, no, we forgot
Cody. We gotta go back.

1145
01:34:40,415 --> 01:34:43,084
Goodbye, Cody.

1146
01:35:01,102 --> 01:35:05,106
See, this represents the Belafonte.
and here's Pescespada lsland,

1147
01:35:05,190 --> 01:35:07,651
and that circle represents friendship,

1148
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:10,403
and the K here stands for Klaus.

1149
01:35:10,487 --> 01:35:12,948
Where's your symbol, Ned?

1150
01:35:13,031 --> 01:35:15,033
l didn't wanna impose myself.

1151
01:35:15,116 --> 01:35:18,703
Klaus is right. The
flag needs a Ned symbol.

1152
01:35:18,829 --> 01:35:23,375
l suppose we could put an N
on the side of that octopus.

1153
01:35:23,458 --> 01:35:26,002
What's that stand for over there?

1154
01:35:26,128 --> 01:35:27,838
That's Esteban.

1155
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:30,674
lt was working OK until late last night,

1156
01:35:30,799 --> 01:35:34,136
but now the tracking system's
gone completely on the fritz.

1157
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:40,225
Screw it. Sell it for scrap along with the
boat and the submarines. l'm going home.

1158
01:35:40,767 --> 01:35:43,895
Let's take up the whirlybird
and see what we find, anyway.

1159
01:35:43,979 --> 01:35:47,399
l got a feeling we can spot
this fish from 111 feet up.

1160
01:35:47,482 --> 01:35:51,236
Ned, l don't know if l
ever even saw the bastard.

1161
01:35:52,362 --> 01:35:56,283
l have $ 275,000 invested
in this damn production.

1162
01:35:56,366 --> 01:35:59,953
Something ate Esteban,
didn't it? Now lead!

1163
01:36:01,121 --> 01:36:03,165
Right?

1164
01:36:03,290 --> 01:36:05,500
Right? Ho!

1165
01:36:09,504 --> 01:36:10,005
Ho.

1166
01:36:29,524 --> 01:36:31,109
What's that?

1167
01:36:31,193 --> 01:36:33,236
Letter from Jane.

1168
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:36,198
What does she say?

1169
01:36:36,281 --> 01:36:38,742
Nothing to speak of.

1170
01:36:47,584 --> 01:36:50,045
Thank you for putting
me on the flag, Ned.

1171
01:36:50,128 --> 01:36:52,589
Of course, Klaus. lt was my pleasure.

1172
01:36:52,672 --> 01:36:54,633
But you stitched me onto the dolphin,

1173
01:36:54,758 --> 01:36:57,385
and l want you to know
how much that means to me.

1174
01:36:57,469 --> 01:36:59,429
Well, l'm very pleased you liked it.

1175
01:36:59,513 --> 01:37:02,849
You're not listening!
l didn't just like it...

1176
01:37:09,272 --> 01:37:13,985
- You understand?
- Yes, l do. Thank you, Klaus.

1177
01:37:25,664 --> 01:37:27,874
l've still got yours, of course.

1178
01:37:27,999 --> 01:37:29,334
My what?

1179
01:37:34,715 --> 01:37:39,136
''Dear Captain Zissou, l am 12 years
old and live in Jawbone, Kentucky.''

1180
01:37:39,219 --> 01:37:42,097
''A creek runs behind our house,
where l live with my mother.''

1181
01:37:42,180 --> 01:37:43,932
''She met you once some years ago,

1182
01:37:44,015 --> 01:37:47,936
and l collect and catalogue
amphibians, reptiles and insects.''

1183
01:37:48,061 --> 01:37:51,022
''l don't know what this
one's called, so l named it.''

1184
01:37:51,106 --> 01:37:55,026
''You are probably my one of, if not
the favourite person l've ever studied.''

1185
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:58,029
''l plan to be either
A: an oceanographer,

1186
01:37:58,113 --> 01:38:00,407
B: an architect, C: a pilot.''

1187
01:38:00,490 --> 01:38:03,869
''Thank you for your good
work. Sincerely, Ned Plimpton,

1188
01:38:03,952 --> 01:38:06,246
Blue Star Cadet, Zissou Society.''

1189
01:38:06,329 --> 01:38:08,999
''PS: Do you ever wish you
could breathe underwater?''

1190
01:38:13,211 --> 01:38:16,173
l still wish l could breathe underwater.

1191
01:38:16,256 --> 01:38:18,050
Me, too, Ned.

1192
01:38:24,473 --> 01:38:27,976
- Fluorescent snapper.
- What? Really? What's that?

1193
01:38:28,101 --> 01:38:31,480
A good sign. The last time we
saw that big shitkicker here...

1194
01:38:37,652 --> 01:38:39,946
Something popped up there, didn't it?

1195
01:38:40,072 --> 01:38:42,741
l heard a pin snap loose
on the rotator mechanism.

1196
01:38:48,413 --> 01:38:50,874
This is gonna hurt.

1197
01:39:07,933 --> 01:39:08,934
Ned!

1198
01:39:09,935 --> 01:39:11,728
Ned!

1199
01:39:16,316 --> 01:39:19,194
- Ned.
- Hey, Stevesie.

1200
01:39:27,661 --> 01:39:29,621
Are you OK?

1201
01:39:30,664 --> 01:39:33,041
l think l'm OK.

1202
01:39:35,168 --> 01:39:38,130
What happened? Did we hit something?

1203
01:39:39,131 --> 01:39:41,508
Most likely not.

1204
01:39:42,509 --> 01:39:45,220
l think maybe the pushrod failed.

1205
01:39:46,638 --> 01:39:50,767
l'm sorry, Ned. l should've
scrapped this chopper ten years ago.

1206
01:39:50,851 --> 01:39:56,064
Maybe l should've autorotated and
performed a high bank during our descent.

1207
01:39:56,189 --> 01:39:59,151
We might've crashed a little softer.

1208
01:40:00,610 --> 01:40:04,531
Probably wouldn't have
made any difference, though.

1209
01:41:12,683 --> 01:41:14,476
All hands, bury the dead.

1210
01:42:20,459 --> 01:42:24,671
This is the first time Eleanor's
ever cried in front of me.

1211
01:42:24,755 --> 01:42:27,841
Except for once when she got
her arm caught in the deck winch.

1212
01:42:29,468 --> 01:42:32,888
ls this my espresso machine?

1213
01:42:33,889 --> 01:42:36,892
How did you get my espresso machine?

1214
01:42:36,975 --> 01:42:39,061
Well, uh...

1215
01:42:39,144 --> 01:42:41,438
We fucking stole it, man.

1216
01:42:44,691 --> 01:42:50,197
Ali, why don't you go powder your
nose? l need to talk to your ex-wife.

1217
01:42:54,993 --> 01:42:58,664
We've never made great
husbands, have we?

1218
01:42:58,789 --> 01:43:02,376
Of course, l have a good
excuse. l'm part gay.

1219
01:43:03,418 --> 01:43:05,712
Supposedly, everyone is.

1220
01:43:18,267 --> 01:43:21,144
l never told you this,
but l was hoping...

1221
01:43:21,228 --> 01:43:25,691
we might get the chance to adopt Ned.
l think he would've wanted it that way.

1222
01:43:25,774 --> 01:43:29,111
- Would you have gone along with me?
- He was 30, Steve.

1223
01:43:29,236 --> 01:43:31,864
But l'd have considered it.

1224
01:43:31,947 --> 01:43:33,282
Thanks, Eleanor.

1225
01:43:33,782 --> 01:43:35,868
We're a dying breed.

1226
01:43:35,951 --> 01:43:38,579
Yeah.

1227
01:43:38,662 --> 01:43:41,290
l guess we were all right
while we lasted, though.

1228
01:43:41,373 --> 01:43:44,293
Oh, we were like
glory's gate, my darling.

1229
01:43:44,376 --> 01:43:48,463
We were like that bloody shark of
yours. We swam with the, um, uh...

1230
01:43:48,547 --> 01:43:52,759
Oh, goddammit. l had it on the
plane. What was l gonna say?

1231
01:43:52,843 --> 01:43:56,430
- Ah, well, it's good to see you.
- How's your passport status?

1232
01:43:56,513 --> 01:43:59,892
Much better, thank you.
l'm back down to X-4.

1233
01:43:59,975 --> 01:44:03,228
Tell me, who knocked up the reporter?

1234
01:44:05,022 --> 01:44:06,273
l don't know.

1235
01:44:13,363 --> 01:44:15,407
Thanks for showing me the first draft.

1236
01:44:15,532 --> 01:44:18,744
You read it. What did you think?

1237
01:44:18,827 --> 01:44:21,205
Well, l was a little
embarrassed at first.

1238
01:44:21,288 --> 01:44:26,001
Obviously people are gonna think l'm
a showboat and a little bit of a prick,

1239
01:44:26,126 --> 01:44:28,962
but then l realised...

1240
01:44:29,046 --> 01:44:30,839
That's me.

1241
01:44:30,923 --> 01:44:33,884
l said those things, l did those things.

1242
01:44:34,885 --> 01:44:37,179
l can live with that.

1243
01:44:39,348 --> 01:44:41,558
You're a good writer, Jane.

1244
01:44:41,683 --> 01:44:43,811
lt's the effing cover.

1245
01:44:44,812 --> 01:44:46,688
Attagirl.

1246
01:44:47,731 --> 01:44:50,275
Excuse me.

1247
01:44:50,359 --> 01:44:55,155
Sorry to interrupt, but we got the scanning
monitor up. Looks like the jaguar shark,

1248
01:44:55,239 --> 01:45:00,118
or whatever it is that we're tracking, is
in a trench on the far side of the reef.

1249
01:45:03,956 --> 01:45:07,793
What the hell is going on
in here with the wiring?

1250
01:45:11,964 --> 01:45:14,258
Anybody feel like going for a ride?

1251
01:45:24,268 --> 01:45:28,522
Ned's Theme, take one.

1252
01:45:31,733 --> 01:45:36,488
l hooked a rhinestone bluefin on a
rope to give him something to eat.

1253
01:46:22,034 --> 01:46:27,164
ls that one of mine? l think one
of my research turtles survived.

1254
01:47:07,287 --> 01:47:09,581
Yeah, looks good.

1255
01:48:18,609 --> 01:48:22,446
- ls that him?
- That's him, Klaus.

1256
01:48:43,425 --> 01:48:45,636
Are we... Are we safe in here?

1257
01:48:46,679 --> 01:48:48,681
l doubt it.

1258
01:48:48,764 --> 01:48:51,517
You still want to blow him up?

1259
01:48:52,518 --> 01:48:55,854
No. We're out of dynamite, anyway.

1260
01:49:00,192 --> 01:49:02,945
lt is beautiful, Steve.

1261
01:49:03,779 --> 01:49:05,781
Yeah, it's pretty good, isn't it?

1262
01:49:09,493 --> 01:49:11,787
l wonder if it remembers me.

1263
01:49:37,938 --> 01:49:41,108
ln 12 years, he'll be 11 and a half.

1264
01:49:44,069 --> 01:49:46,363
That was my favourite age.

1265
01:50:00,502 --> 01:50:04,256
- Like this?
- Just like that.

1266
01:50:04,381 --> 01:50:06,675
You do it, too.

1267
01:50:07,801 --> 01:50:13,390
We complete the adventure, but
another of our crew has been lost.

1268
01:50:13,474 --> 01:50:15,351
This one was my son.

1269
01:50:16,226 --> 01:50:18,604
Also our equity partner.

1270
01:50:19,355 --> 01:50:23,108
We start the voyage home
in our wounded vessel.

1271
01:51:26,797 --> 01:51:28,299
Ho.

1272
01:51:28,424 --> 01:51:29,675
Ho.

1273
01:51:43,314 --> 01:51:45,608
This is an adventure.
