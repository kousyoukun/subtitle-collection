1
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:06,278
The Obyamywe Peninsula,

2
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:10,866
a remote and fascinating region
teeming with extraordinary marine life.

3
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:15,745
We chose its mysterious waters
as the Belafonte's next destination.

4
00:01:16,162 --> 00:01:18,999
ln preparation for our voyage,
the members of Team Zissou

5
00:01:19,082 --> 00:01:23,295
gathered at my oceanographic
observatory here on Pescespada lsland.

6
00:01:23,378 --> 00:01:26,506
This was to be our most
ambitious adventure to date,

7
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,509
and ultimately a tragic one.

8
00:01:29,593 --> 00:01:33,096
Our team included Esteban du Plantier,
chief diver.

9
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,766
Our senior statesman,
my closest colleague for 2 7 years.

10
00:01:36,892 --> 00:01:39,561
Klaus Daimler, 40, engineer.

11
00:01:39,644 --> 00:01:41,771
Calm, collected, German.

12
00:01:41,855 --> 00:01:45,525
Vikram Ray, 28, cameraman.
Born on the Ganges.

13
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,195
Bobby Ogata, 22, frogman.

14
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,573
Renzo Pietro, 45,
editor, soundman.

15
00:01:51,656 --> 00:01:55,702
Vladimir Wolodarsky, 33,
physicist, original score composer.

16
00:01:55,785 --> 00:01:58,872
Anne-Marie Sakowitz, 25,
script girl.

17
00:01:58,955 --> 00:02:02,125
Pele dos Santos, 30,
safety expert.

18
00:02:03,376 --> 00:02:05,337
Eleanor Zissou, my wife,

19
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,797
vice-president
of the Zissou Society.

20
00:02:07,923 --> 00:02:11,927
We'd also invited marine science students
from the University of North Alaska

21
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,847
to accompany us as unpaid interns
in exchange for school credit.

22
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:23,605
October 1 2th. Esteban and l explore
the blue reefs beyond the peninsula.

23
00:02:25,774 --> 00:02:28,818
Fluorescent snapper
unexpectedly appear in the shallows,

24
00:02:28,902 --> 00:02:30,695
extremely rare at this depth.

25
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,751
Where's your gun?

26
00:02:44,876 --> 00:02:48,171
Steve? Steve?
Where's Esteban?

27
00:02:48,255 --> 00:02:49,589
ls that thing rolling, Vikram?

28
00:03:00,141 --> 00:03:03,228
Check the scanning monitor. Start
tracking it before it goes too deep!

29
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:05,605
- Esteban was bitten?
- Eaten!

30
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:07,357
ls he dead?

31
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,985
- Esteban was eaten.
- He was swallowed whole?

32
00:03:10,068 --> 00:03:14,614
No! Chewed.
Check the scanning monitor!

33
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:18,034
He's got hydrogen psychosis, ''crazy eye''.

34
00:03:18,118 --> 00:03:20,579
Steve, we think you got crazy eye.

35
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,330
Get him out of the fucking water.

36
00:03:22,414 --> 00:03:23,665
Esteban!

37
00:03:23,748 --> 00:03:26,668
Esteban! Esteban!

38
00:03:26,751 --> 00:03:27,669
Esteban!

39
00:03:27,794 --> 00:03:28,795
Esteban!

40
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,339
- Steve!
- Esteban!

41
00:03:31,464 --> 00:03:32,716
Esteban!

42
00:03:32,841 --> 00:03:34,092
Esteban!

43
00:03:34,176 --> 00:03:36,720
Esteban!

44
00:03:49,107 --> 00:03:54,237
Was it a deliberate choice
never to show the jaguar shark?

45
00:03:54,362 --> 00:03:56,072
No, l dropped the camera.

46
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:03,872
Why are they laughing?

47
00:04:08,168 --> 00:04:10,837
Yes. What's next for Team Zissou?

48
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:14,591
Well, that was only part one.
lt's a cliffhanger.

49
00:04:14,674 --> 00:04:18,595
Now l'm gonna go hunt down that shark,
or whatever it is,

50
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,389
and, hopefully, kill it.

51
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,392
l don't know how yet.
Maybe dynamite.

52
00:04:25,185 --> 00:04:26,978
You don't know what it is?

53
00:04:27,062 --> 00:04:29,356
No, l've never seen anything like it
before in my life.

54
00:04:29,481 --> 00:04:32,400
You say it is a jaguar shark.
That's the title of your film.

55
00:04:32,484 --> 00:04:35,570
lt was coming right at us. l just said
the first two words that came into my head.

56
00:04:38,907 --> 00:04:41,284
That's an endangered species at most.

57
00:04:41,368 --> 00:04:45,622
What would be
the scientific purpose of killing it?

58
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:49,543
Revenge.

59
00:04:59,219 --> 00:05:02,180
Bravo! What fun.

60
00:05:02,264 --> 00:05:04,099
Steve, l'd like to introduce you
to Antonia Cook.

61
00:05:04,182 --> 00:05:06,810
She's the new head of the film society.

62
00:05:06,893 --> 00:05:10,814
- You must be so excited.
- l hope so. You think it went OK?

63
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:14,276
No. Congratulations, seriously.

64
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:18,864
Thanks. l wish it didn't require
the ''seriously'', but thank you.

65
00:05:18,947 --> 00:05:22,117
Well, l just don't think they got it.

66
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,119
- Steve...
- Shit turnout tonight.

67
00:05:24,202 --> 00:05:26,413
..you know Larry Amin,
chairman of Saudifilm.

68
00:05:26,538 --> 00:05:27,539
Oh, yeah. Hi.

69
00:05:27,622 --> 00:05:29,749
Larry and l were discussing
our financial predicament.

70
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:33,086
l thought it would be nice if the three of us
rode out to the party together.

71
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:35,589
Why? Does Larry have
that kind of spending bread to invest?

72
00:05:35,714 --> 00:05:38,884
- The king's backing him now.
- l got $500 million capitalisation from him.

73
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:41,094
Captain Zissou, can l get a shot of you
with Captain Hennessey?

74
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:43,180
Where?

75
00:05:46,183 --> 00:05:47,851
Make it quick.

76
00:05:47,934 --> 00:05:50,061
Hey, Steven.
How's everything going with your...

77
00:05:50,187 --> 00:05:52,105
What are you calling it?
Leopard fish?

78
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:55,859
- Jaguar shark.
- Jaguar shark, exactly.

79
00:05:55,984 --> 00:06:00,322
l love it.
Tell me something, does it actually exist?

80
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:03,200
You know, Ali, l don't want
to give away the ending.

81
00:06:04,201 --> 00:06:05,368
Good man.

82
00:06:05,452 --> 00:06:07,996
Oh, here comes our girl.

83
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:14,461
You're the most ravishing creature
that l've ever seen in my life.

84
00:06:14,544 --> 00:06:15,921
- Hello, skinny.
- Hello, Eleanor.

85
00:06:16,004 --> 00:06:18,048
ls that a new merit badge?

86
00:06:18,173 --> 00:06:19,674
Yeah, as a matter of fact, it is.

87
00:06:19,758 --> 00:06:23,887
l just became a knight in Portugal.
The presidente gave a special ball...

88
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,641
Don't be nice to Ali.
He's my nemesis.

89
00:06:27,724 --> 00:06:29,643
How could you lay
that slick faggot?

90
00:06:29,726 --> 00:06:32,395
Well, l was in love with him at the time.

91
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,565
Yeah, he's charismatic.

92
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:38,443
- How are you feeling?
- l'm right on the edge.

93
00:06:38,527 --> 00:06:40,487
l don't know what comes next.

94
00:06:40,612 --> 00:06:42,739
Wait here. l'll be right back.

95
00:06:46,743 --> 00:06:49,704
l just wanted to say hello. Hi.

96
00:06:49,788 --> 00:06:51,748
Hey, baby.

97
00:06:52,624 --> 00:06:57,587
l said l wanted to say hello.
l didn't say l wanted you to touch me.

98
00:06:57,671 --> 00:07:00,340
l'm here with my wife.
Eleanor, this is Mandeeza.

99
00:07:00,423 --> 00:07:03,176
Do we really want to put me through this?

100
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,890
People say Eleanor
is the brains behind Team Zissou.

101
00:07:09,015 --> 00:07:11,226
What is Steve?

102
00:07:12,352 --> 00:07:14,646
He's the Zissou.

103
00:07:22,404 --> 00:07:25,657
Steve, this is my little nephew Werner.

104
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,868
He wanted to meet you.

105
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:31,788
- How you doing, Werner?
- He brought you a present.

106
00:07:33,623 --> 00:07:35,709
A crayon pony fish.

107
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:37,794
Wow.

108
00:07:37,878 --> 00:07:40,422
lnteresting specimen.

109
00:07:42,048 --> 00:07:44,885
- Thanks, pal.
- You're welcome.

110
00:07:44,968 --> 00:07:47,429
Steve...

111
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:50,223
you don't look too good.

112
00:07:51,266 --> 00:07:53,059
How's this?

113
00:07:53,143 --> 00:07:56,354
Steve, there's a bloke over there
wants a word with you.

114
00:07:56,438 --> 00:07:57,522
What do you need, old man?

115
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,668
How many of these do you have?

116
00:08:19,544 --> 00:08:24,007
All right, look, just forge
the rest of 'em yourself, all right?

117
00:08:26,176 --> 00:08:28,178
Get outta here.

118
00:08:48,448 --> 00:08:52,536
Hey, Steve, how come you're not
sitting shivah for your friend Esteban?

119
00:08:54,746 --> 00:08:56,706
What'd you say?

120
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,502
Who you gonna kill in part two?

121
00:09:05,423 --> 00:09:06,800
Steve.

122
00:09:56,433 --> 00:10:00,103
Larry Amin's flying back to Mecca tonight,
to see if he can make the numbers work.

123
00:10:00,187 --> 00:10:03,106
He should have an answer for us
in ten days.

124
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,817
Tell him we need to know by Sunday.

125
00:10:05,901 --> 00:10:07,444
Why would l do that, my darling?

126
00:10:07,527 --> 00:10:11,364
To call his bluff, dammit,
to light a fire under his ass.

127
00:10:11,448 --> 00:10:14,367
My darling, we haven't made
a hit documentary in nine years.

128
00:10:14,451 --> 00:10:16,286
Let's not fuck with Larry Amin.

129
00:10:16,369 --> 00:10:18,455
- Doubles.
- Explain it to him, will you, Eleanor?

130
00:10:18,538 --> 00:10:20,040
- Screwdriver.
- He understands.

131
00:10:20,123 --> 00:10:22,584
Amin needs to make a projection
of the world grosses

132
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:26,546
to see if he can get a tax break
and run it through his output deal.

133
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:29,883
l don't understand, but l can tell it's bullshit.

134
00:10:29,966 --> 00:10:31,843
Oh, what the hell is going on?

135
00:10:31,927 --> 00:10:34,054
Play the black jack
on the red queen.

136
00:10:36,765 --> 00:10:39,476
Well, if you'll excuse me,
l'm gonna go on an overnight drunk,

137
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:43,688
and in ten days l'm gonna set out to find
the shark that ate my friend and destroy it.

138
00:10:43,772 --> 00:10:46,775
Anyone that would care to
join me is more than welcome.

139
00:10:50,654 --> 00:10:53,698
Captain Zissou, l'm sorry to bother you.
l'm Ned Plimpton.

140
00:10:53,782 --> 00:10:56,076
OK, man.

141
00:10:56,201 --> 00:10:58,745
My mother's Katherine Plimpton.

142
00:11:02,457 --> 00:11:05,293
- You're kidding.
- No.

143
00:11:05,377 --> 00:11:08,255
- How is she?
- She died last month.

144
00:11:10,423 --> 00:11:12,884
l'm sorry. Shit.

145
00:11:13,677 --> 00:11:15,679
She was...

146
00:11:21,393 --> 00:11:23,353
l've heard of you.

147
00:11:31,987 --> 00:11:34,739
l don't know if it's true or not,
by the way. Do you?

148
00:11:34,823 --> 00:11:37,117
No, l don't.

149
00:11:37,242 --> 00:11:40,161
l haven't heard from her in 30 years.

150
00:11:41,872 --> 00:11:44,249
l guess it's too late now.

151
00:11:46,835 --> 00:11:50,338
She never contacted me, you know.

152
00:11:50,422 --> 00:11:52,382
Yes, l see.

153
00:11:56,052 --> 00:12:00,515
- You're supposed to be my son, right?
- l don't know.

154
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:03,727
But l did want to meet you,
just in case.

155
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,480
l appreciate that.

156
00:12:14,362 --> 00:12:17,741
l'll be right back.
Don't go away?

157
00:13:11,211 --> 00:13:14,256
Sorry about that. You caught me with
one foot off the merry-go-round tonight.

158
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:17,092
Oh, that's all right. l don't wanna
take up too much of your time.

159
00:13:17,175 --> 00:13:19,553
l wanna thank you for talking to me and...

160
00:13:19,636 --> 00:13:21,847
- We'll find a way, mate.
- l know we will.

161
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,558
l just had a lovely chat
with Si Perlman.

162
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:27,561
He wants to make a big to-do
of the Oceanographic Explorer article,

163
00:13:27,644 --> 00:13:29,062
possibly give you the front cover,

164
00:13:29,145 --> 00:13:31,940
so do be nice to this girl
Miss Winslett-Richardson, won't you?

165
00:13:32,023 --> 00:13:36,987
Apparently she worships you,
and we dearly need the press.

166
00:13:37,112 --> 00:13:40,699
Oseary, this is probably my son Ned.
We just met.

167
00:13:40,824 --> 00:13:42,951
Ah. Oh, how delightful.

168
00:13:43,034 --> 00:13:44,786
Hello.

169
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:48,790
Anyway, his mother just died.
Plus, we're having some problems.

170
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:52,669
l just think it'd be a very special opportunity
for all of us, especially him.

171
00:13:52,794 --> 00:13:55,255
- He needs this deal.
- OK, bring him over.

172
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,340
Well, he's right here.

173
00:14:01,845 --> 00:14:03,972
l'm sorry.
How do you do?

174
00:14:08,393 --> 00:14:12,147
- So what do you do?
- l'm a pilot. Air Kentucky.

175
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,151
- Air Kentucky.
- Copilot, actually.

176
00:14:16,234 --> 00:14:19,029
- Yeah, l don't know that one.
- We hub out of Louisville.

177
00:14:19,112 --> 00:14:23,283
Sure, there's some pretty country
in those parts. Landlocked.

178
00:14:24,284 --> 00:14:29,664
l have to tell you, l've been a member
of the Zissou Society since l was 1 1 .

179
00:14:29,748 --> 00:14:32,125
Well, l'll be damned.
Look at that.

180
00:14:34,377 --> 00:14:37,297
- Wanna kill this?
- Frankly, l'd better not.

181
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,175
l don't usually try grass.

182
00:14:46,181 --> 00:14:48,558
Let me tell you about my boat.

183
00:14:54,773 --> 00:14:58,360
The Belafonte was a long-range
subhunter during the Second World War,

184
00:14:58,443 --> 00:15:01,947
which we bought from the U.S. Navy
for $900,000.

185
00:15:02,072 --> 00:15:06,660
This is my mentor, Lord Mandrake.
He's dead now.

186
00:15:07,953 --> 00:15:11,873
The sauna was designed by an engineer
from the Chinese space program,

187
00:15:11,957 --> 00:15:16,002
and we keep a Swedish masseuse
on staff.

188
00:15:16,086 --> 00:15:21,925
Here's where we do all our science
projects and experiments and so on.

189
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:24,010
This is the kitchen,
which contains probably

190
00:15:24,094 --> 00:15:28,265
some of the most technologically
advanced equipment on the ship.

191
00:15:29,266 --> 00:15:31,935
Eleanor put together
a topnotch research library for us,

192
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:36,898
with a complete first-edition set
of The Life Aquatic Companion Series.

193
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:39,484
We process our own rushes
and keep a cutting room on board

194
00:15:39,568 --> 00:15:41,528
so we can do an assembly
while we're shooting.

195
00:15:41,611 --> 00:15:44,656
- l can't find them.
- Once again, please.

196
00:15:46,366 --> 00:15:52,539
This is the observation bubble,
which l thought up in a dream, actually.

197
00:15:52,664 --> 00:15:54,958
Two albino scouts swim with the ship.

198
00:15:55,041 --> 00:16:00,172
They're supposedly very intelligent,
although l've never seen evidence of it.

199
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,091
Here's the engine room. The bearing
casings aren't supposed to look like that,

200
00:16:03,175 --> 00:16:06,469
but we can't afford to fix 'em this year.

201
00:16:06,553 --> 00:16:09,264
Topside we've got the bridge,
the minisub, an old chopper

202
00:16:09,347 --> 00:16:13,602
and all kinds of radar and sonar
and underwater movie gadgets.

203
00:16:13,685 --> 00:16:16,688
What happened to ''Jacqueline''?

204
00:16:16,771 --> 00:16:19,316
She didn't really love me.

205
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:33,079
Lord Mandrake.

206
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,168
lt's wonderful. Very lifelike.

207
00:16:38,251 --> 00:16:40,253
l'm not crazy about it.

208
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:49,804
This guy's a big-time asshole.
We were roommates at the academy.

209
00:16:49,888 --> 00:16:52,641
He used to be married to Eleanor.

210
00:16:52,724 --> 00:16:55,268
He hogs up all the grant money.

211
00:16:55,393 --> 00:16:58,480
You think you'll want
to change your name?

212
00:16:58,563 --> 00:16:59,564
Ned?

213
00:16:59,689 --> 00:17:01,816
No, not the Ned part,
unless you want to.

214
00:17:01,942 --> 00:17:07,239
l meant your last name. l thought
you might like to let me give you mine.

215
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,034
- Ned Zissou?
- Ned Zissou. Exactly.

216
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:13,328
Or if you want to,
you can change the first part, too.

217
00:17:13,453 --> 00:17:16,790
l would have named you Kingsley
if l'd had a say in it.

218
00:17:16,873 --> 00:17:18,583
Kingsley.

219
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:22,420
l don't know.
Maybe l'll stick with Ned for now.

220
00:17:22,546 --> 00:17:23,880
Sure. That's OK.

221
00:17:23,964 --> 00:17:28,385
Anyway, l'll order you
some correspondence stock.

222
00:17:28,468 --> 00:17:30,512
What are you doing?
l ordered the wine.

223
00:17:30,595 --> 00:17:34,349
Pour it over here, please.
He doesn't know anything about wine.

224
00:17:41,773 --> 00:17:43,650
Are those assholes talking about me?

225
00:18:00,584 --> 00:18:02,878
People say, when someone says
something like that about you

226
00:18:03,003 --> 00:18:05,297
it's because they're jealous.

227
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,050
But it still hurts.
lt hurts bad.

228
00:18:09,176 --> 00:18:13,221
That man was damn rude.
He can go straight to hell.

229
00:18:29,654 --> 00:18:32,741
How did she die, by the way, your mother?

230
00:18:33,783 --> 00:18:37,537
She took her own life.
She took sleeping pills.

231
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,374
Why would she do that?

232
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:45,545
Well, she was in a great deal of pain,
you know.

233
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,382
l see, yeah.

234
00:18:51,051 --> 00:18:54,888
You know, my best friend just got killed.
Esteban.

235
00:18:55,013 --> 00:18:56,473
Yeah, l know.

236
00:18:56,556 --> 00:18:58,558
The old man.

237
00:19:01,478 --> 00:19:04,022
Let's go to my island.

238
00:19:04,105 --> 00:19:05,649
Well, l...

239
00:19:05,732 --> 00:19:08,485
l have to be back in Kentucky
on Thursday.

240
00:19:08,568 --> 00:19:11,238
Thursday? OK.

241
00:19:11,321 --> 00:19:13,198
That's OK.

242
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:52,654
Your cat's dead.

243
00:19:52,737 --> 00:19:55,282
- What? Which one?
- Marmalade.

244
00:19:55,407 --> 00:19:57,367
l'm sorry.

245
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,744
What happened?

246
00:19:59,828 --> 00:20:02,706
A rattlesnake bit it in the throat.

247
00:20:04,249 --> 00:20:06,293
Goddammit, Eleanor,
why do you have to say it like that?

248
00:20:06,418 --> 00:20:10,255
You couldn't try to break it
a little bit nicer?

249
00:20:15,343 --> 00:20:19,097
She's a rich bitch, you know.
She was raised by maids.

250
00:20:19,181 --> 00:20:23,977
Her parents paid for this island
and two of my worst movies.

251
00:20:25,395 --> 00:20:29,482
People say she's the brains
behind Team Zissou.

252
00:20:29,566 --> 00:20:33,403
People say a lot of things.
What kind of cat was it?

253
00:20:34,404 --> 00:20:37,991
Who gives a shit?
l think it was a tabby.

254
00:20:38,074 --> 00:20:41,828
Ned? Wanna come inside,
we'll make up a room for you?

255
00:20:41,912 --> 00:20:44,372
Steve, that reporter called.

256
00:21:00,514 --> 00:21:04,601
Ned, wake up. l'm on the echo
box. Push the red button to answer.

257
00:21:04,684 --> 00:21:06,686
Throw on your slob and meet me
on the beach in 1 2 minutes.

258
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,855
The white button? OK.

259
00:21:12,567 --> 00:21:14,027
Action!

260
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:18,865
Only twice before have l had
the good fortune to observe a ''rubber tide'',

261
00:21:18,949 --> 00:21:21,493
that rare occurrence
when hundreds of electric jellyfish

262
00:21:21,618 --> 00:21:24,454
spontaneously wash
onto a beachhead at once.

263
00:21:24,538 --> 00:21:29,417
Bobby Ogata brings exactly this
to our attention tonight.

264
00:21:32,712 --> 00:21:35,006
Steve, what produces
this effect of illumination?

265
00:21:35,131 --> 00:21:38,510
ls there a chemical inside the organism?

266
00:21:39,678 --> 00:21:43,932
No, Ned. Actually, it's the reflection
of the moonlight on their outer membranes.

267
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:49,813
That's a very good ad lib.

268
00:21:49,896 --> 00:21:52,107
Klaus, come over here
and get a two-shot of me and Ned.

269
00:21:52,232 --> 00:21:53,900
Ned, come in here.

270
00:21:58,446 --> 00:22:00,574
Would you like to join my crew?

271
00:22:01,616 --> 00:22:04,953
- Would l like to...
- l want you on Team Zissou.

272
00:22:05,078 --> 00:22:08,081
- l don't think l can do that.
- Why not?

273
00:22:08,165 --> 00:22:11,585
Well, it's not my field.
l don't have the background for it.

274
00:22:11,668 --> 00:22:15,088
No one here does.
Klaus used to be a bus driver.

275
00:22:15,213 --> 00:22:17,757
Wolodarsky was a high-school
substitute teacher.

276
00:22:17,841 --> 00:22:20,051
We're a pack of strays.
Don't you get it?

277
00:22:20,135 --> 00:22:23,555
Steve, l'm not even
that strong a swimmer.

278
00:22:26,057 --> 00:22:29,644
- The answer's yes.
- Well, it's got to be.

279
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:31,521
l'll order you a red cap
and a Speedo.

280
00:22:31,605 --> 00:22:34,316
Cut. Klaus, why aren't you rolling?

281
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:36,193
Could l have a word with you, please?

282
00:22:36,776 --> 00:22:38,987
Why aren't you getting this?

283
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:44,159
That was a goddamn tearjerker.
Why did you cut it, man?

284
00:22:44,242 --> 00:22:46,286
Because the sound is going to be shit.

285
00:22:46,411 --> 00:22:49,247
He doesn't even know how to hold a boom.

286
00:22:49,331 --> 00:22:51,958
He doesn't know diddly-jack
about what we're doing.

287
00:22:52,042 --> 00:22:54,961
Don't cut unless l say cut.

288
00:22:55,045 --> 00:22:58,965
l've never seen so many electric jellyfish
in all my life.

289
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:01,051
Those are Vietcong man-of-wars.

290
00:23:10,602 --> 00:23:12,646
Oh, shit, she's right.

291
00:23:12,729 --> 00:23:15,357
l guess we'll have to loop that line.

292
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,317
Where'd you come from?
You look pregnant.

293
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,652
l am pregnant.

294
00:23:18,777 --> 00:23:20,904
l'm not even going to ask
what you men are doing out here

295
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:22,906
in your matching pyjamas,
by the way.

296
00:23:22,989 --> 00:23:26,827
We're producing a film, as a matter of fact.
Who are you?

297
00:23:26,952 --> 00:23:29,329
l'm Jane Winslett-Richardson.

298
00:23:29,454 --> 00:23:31,581
l'm the reporter
from the Oceanographic Explorer.

299
00:23:31,706 --> 00:23:33,583
Oh, yeah, sure.
How'd you get out here?

300
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:35,836
l hired some drunk in a fishing boat.

301
00:23:35,961 --> 00:23:39,256
That would take four hours.
Why would you do that?

302
00:23:39,339 --> 00:23:42,592
Because no one picked me up
at the effing airport.

303
00:23:42,717 --> 00:23:44,177
Jesus Christ, Klaus.

304
00:23:44,261 --> 00:23:46,972
One of my guys was supposed to do that.

305
00:23:47,055 --> 00:23:49,766
How long have you
been working with Zissou?

306
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:52,310
Uh, approximately...

307
00:23:52,435 --> 00:23:55,272
Only ten minutes, actually.
l was hired during the scene on the beach.

308
00:23:55,355 --> 00:23:58,400
- He's Steve's son, supposedly.
- You are?

309
00:23:58,483 --> 00:24:00,443
No, you're not.
He doesn't have one.

310
00:24:00,527 --> 00:24:02,654
Well, we're not 1 00% sure
about that yet.

311
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:05,240
We just met yesterday.

312
00:24:06,324 --> 00:24:09,286
Not this one, Klaus.

313
00:24:13,415 --> 00:24:15,876
You heard me. Not this one.

314
00:24:16,001 --> 00:24:17,627
OK.

315
00:24:17,711 --> 00:24:19,713
- First thing in the morning, huh?
- Just print everything?

316
00:24:19,796 --> 00:24:23,216
- Yeah, tell him to push it a stop and a half.
- OK.

317
00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:26,803
What are you gonna do with him?

318
00:24:26,887 --> 00:24:29,639
Who? Ned?

319
00:24:29,723 --> 00:24:31,725
What do you mean?

320
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:36,146
l don't understand the question.

321
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,653
l offered him a spot on the Belafonte.

322
00:24:43,778 --> 00:24:46,656
He didn't take it, did he?

323
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,533
Of course he took it.

324
00:24:48,617 --> 00:24:51,077
We're gonna put him on the map, Eleanor.

325
00:24:51,161 --> 00:24:53,705
We're gonna throw him a life preserver.

326
00:24:53,788 --> 00:24:56,500
- l believe in this boy.
- Why?

327
00:25:00,795 --> 00:25:02,923
Because he looks up to me.

328
00:25:03,548 --> 00:25:07,302
Yes, sir, and McKinnon's willing
to take over my shuttle flights.

329
00:25:07,385 --> 00:25:09,346
That's right.

330
00:25:13,141 --> 00:25:17,270
Well, l just feel l need to
see this thing through, sir.

331
00:25:18,772 --> 00:25:23,276
Thank you for understanding. l'll check in
with the Louisville office again next month.

332
00:25:25,362 --> 00:25:28,782
''..as l have not, as they say,
enough power of observation

333
00:25:28,907 --> 00:25:30,867
to isolate their sense of colour.''

334
00:25:30,992 --> 00:25:34,246
''For a long time afterwards,
whenever l thought of her,

335
00:25:34,329 --> 00:25:41,086
the memory of those bright eyes would at
once present itself to me as a vivid azure.''

336
00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:44,422
''So much so that perhaps if
her eyes had not been quite so black,

337
00:25:44,506 --> 00:25:47,551
which was what struck one most forcibly
on first meeting her,

338
00:25:47,634 --> 00:25:49,761
l should not have been,
as l was,

339
00:25:49,886 --> 00:25:52,973
so especially enamoured
of their imagined blue.''

340
00:25:58,395 --> 00:25:59,646
Hold it.

341
00:26:03,525 --> 00:26:07,362
- That's poetry?
- No, it's a six-volume novel.

342
00:26:07,445 --> 00:26:10,407
Oh, so you're gonna read
that whole thing to yourself out loud.

343
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:13,827
l'm not reading it to myself,
l'm reading it to him.

344
00:26:16,997 --> 00:26:19,374
When did you learn
Zissou was your father?

345
00:26:21,084 --> 00:26:23,003
Does it freak you out
for me to ask that?

346
00:26:23,086 --> 00:26:26,506
No, it doesn't,
but it's a difficult question.

347
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,800
l sort of pieced it together
over the years.

348
00:26:28,925 --> 00:26:31,303
Well, how did he first contact you?

349
00:26:31,428 --> 00:26:35,348
He didn't. l went looking for him last month
after my mother died.

350
00:26:35,432 --> 00:26:39,186
She had ovarian cancer,
then it spread to her stomach and liver,

351
00:26:39,311 --> 00:26:41,021
and she took her own life.

352
00:26:43,773 --> 00:26:47,277
- Well, good night, l guess.
- Oh, good night.

353
00:26:48,236 --> 00:26:51,448
You mind if l stay and listen
for a little while?

354
00:26:53,742 --> 00:26:55,285
OK.

355
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,794
Do you want me
to catch you up on the story?

356
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,756
No, l'll be able to figure it out.

357
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:10,217
l'll just catch as catch can.

358
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:16,723
They made these for about...
three and a half years

359
00:27:16,848 --> 00:27:19,059
before they terminated my sponsorship.

360
00:27:28,151 --> 00:27:29,653
These are great.

361
00:27:29,736 --> 00:27:32,197
- May l turn this on?
- Fire one.

362
00:27:34,991 --> 00:27:40,747
- So what happened, in your opinion?
- What are you talking about?

363
00:27:40,831 --> 00:27:44,751
Don't you think public perception of your
work has altered in the last five years?

364
00:27:44,835 --> 00:27:47,921
That's your first question? l thought
this was supposed to be a puff piece.

365
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:51,091
- Should we come back to it?
- Yeah.

366
00:27:51,174 --> 00:27:52,843
OK.

367
00:27:53,593 --> 00:27:57,097
ls it true that this is going to be
your last voyage?

368
00:27:57,764 --> 00:27:59,808
Wow. No comment.

369
00:28:00,725 --> 00:28:03,270
Who told you that?

370
00:28:03,395 --> 00:28:06,439
No, goddammit. l'm only 52.

371
00:28:06,523 --> 00:28:09,359
How about we start out
with some stock dialogue?

372
00:28:09,442 --> 00:28:13,113
You know, favourite colour... blue.
Favourite food... sardines.

373
00:28:13,196 --> 00:28:15,740
How do you feel about
part one of your new film?

374
00:28:17,033 --> 00:28:19,494
Why? How do you feel
about part one of my new film?

375
00:28:19,578 --> 00:28:22,539
- Well, l'm honest, you know, so...
- Just say it.

376
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:27,419
l thought aspects of it
seemed slightly fake.

377
00:28:29,087 --> 00:28:30,005
Wolodarsky.

378
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:33,341
- l'll take five, Steve.
- How about taking five?

379
00:28:35,218 --> 00:28:40,974
Did it seem fake when my best friend
was bitten in half right in front of me,

380
00:28:41,057 --> 00:28:43,268
then eaten alive, screaming?

381
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:46,313
l think you're a fake.

382
00:28:46,438 --> 00:28:50,192
And l think you're a phony
and a bad reporter.

383
00:28:50,317 --> 00:28:54,154
How does that feel?
Now tell me something...

384
00:28:54,237 --> 00:28:56,865
Does this seem fake?

385
00:28:56,948 --> 00:28:59,493
How dare you!

386
00:28:59,618 --> 00:29:03,455
This entire article was my idea.
No one else gives a shit.

387
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:06,458
What about Si Perlman?

388
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:09,419
Are you joking?
He's not even covering my expenses.

389
00:29:12,547 --> 00:29:14,591
You're taking something out on me.

390
00:29:23,475 --> 00:29:26,895
Stop crying.
What's the deal here?

391
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,231
l was only trying to defend myself.

392
00:29:29,314 --> 00:29:31,525
Well, you did a great job.

393
00:29:32,192 --> 00:29:34,736
l'm sure you'll make a terrific father.

394
00:29:41,409 --> 00:29:44,913
So... you really think you're a Zissou?

395
00:29:47,123 --> 00:29:48,750
l don't know.

396
00:29:48,834 --> 00:29:52,671
You travelled a long way
for ''l don't know'', sonny.

397
00:29:52,754 --> 00:29:56,508
That's true,
but it's important to me.

398
00:29:56,633 --> 00:30:01,429
Ja. well, there are a lot of things that are
important to people around here, sonny.

399
00:30:01,555 --> 00:30:04,432
- Klaus, don't call me sonny.
- One more thing.

400
00:30:04,516 --> 00:30:07,936
lt's the Steve Zissou show,
not the Ned show.

401
00:30:11,022 --> 00:30:14,526
- You hear me?
- Yes, l do.

402
00:30:15,777 --> 00:30:17,112
Klaus!

403
00:30:17,195 --> 00:30:18,280
Ja?

404
00:30:18,405 --> 00:30:20,699
lf you ever touch me again,

405
00:30:20,824 --> 00:30:24,744
l will kick your goddamned teeth out,
is that understood?

406
00:30:26,329 --> 00:30:29,291
Not if l don't see you first, sonny.

407
00:30:39,342 --> 00:30:42,137
We gotta watch ourselves
around this Jane character.

408
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,181
Don't tell her anything personal.

409
00:30:44,306 --> 00:30:48,643
lf you're not sure about something,
change the subject and look for me.

410
00:30:48,727 --> 00:30:52,564
This bull dyke's
got something against us.

411
00:30:52,647 --> 00:30:55,650
l don't think she's a lesbian.
She's pregnant.

412
00:30:55,734 --> 00:30:58,278
Bull dykes can get pregnant.

413
00:30:58,403 --> 00:31:02,157
Anyway, l'd back out now,
but we need the press.

414
00:31:02,282 --> 00:31:04,284
See you in the morning.

415
00:31:05,202 --> 00:31:06,536
Steve?

416
00:31:08,914 --> 00:31:11,875
When'd you first hear about me?

417
00:31:13,793 --> 00:31:18,673
About five years ago.
l read it in an article about myself.

418
00:31:19,591 --> 00:31:21,801
Did you believe it?

419
00:31:22,677 --> 00:31:26,598
lt was in the paper.
l assumed they... checked their facts.

420
00:31:29,643 --> 00:31:32,395
Why didn't you contact me?

421
00:31:34,731 --> 00:31:38,944
Because l hate fathers,
and l never wanted to be one.

422
00:31:47,202 --> 00:31:50,872
l forgot.
Your correspondence stock came in.

423
00:31:58,588 --> 00:32:00,882
Hi, Ross. Started today.

424
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:05,220
l'll forward some pages to you
through the copy department.

425
00:32:06,721 --> 00:32:11,059
You're probably right, though.

426
00:32:11,142 --> 00:32:13,895
What am l doing here?

427
00:32:14,855 --> 00:32:17,399
l miss you and...

428
00:32:17,482 --> 00:32:20,277
Oh, God, l don't know, Ross.

429
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,487
Where are you?

430
00:32:26,032 --> 00:32:28,660
Listen, l'm not leaving this message.

431
00:32:29,661 --> 00:32:32,122
Don't even know why l'm still pregnant.

432
00:32:41,047 --> 00:32:44,551
The script girl uses these for continuity.

433
00:32:44,634 --> 00:32:46,428
- Here.
- Oh, no, no, no.

434
00:32:46,511 --> 00:32:48,722
No exceptions.
Everyone gets one.

435
00:32:48,847 --> 00:32:52,434
Anne-Marie,
do the interns get Glocks?

436
00:32:53,435 --> 00:32:55,896
No, they all share one.

437
00:32:55,979 --> 00:32:58,190
Take it, Ned.

438
00:32:58,273 --> 00:33:00,066
- Steve!
- What?

439
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,360
Whack on the echo box.

440
00:33:04,196 --> 00:33:09,159
- Zissou here.
- Oseary Drakoulias on line two.

441
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,077
Yeah?

442
00:33:11,203 --> 00:33:14,956
l spoke with Larry Amin, and it's a pass.

443
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,751
ln other words, you fucked us.

444
00:33:17,834 --> 00:33:20,795
Let's not cast stones
at one another, my boy.

445
00:33:20,879 --> 00:33:23,548
- Do you hear me, dammit? Do you?
- No, l don't!

446
00:33:23,632 --> 00:33:26,426
- l told you how to play it!
- Bloody hell. Listen here, mate...

447
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,887
May l interrupt for a moment?

448
00:33:29,888 --> 00:33:33,391
- Who the blazes is that?
- lt's me, Ned.

449
00:33:33,517 --> 00:33:35,977
Maybe this is nothing,
maybe it's something.

450
00:33:36,102 --> 00:33:40,106
l don't know your problems.
l don't know...

451
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:43,777
But l just inherited $ 2 75,000.

452
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,696
Would that amount make any difference?

453
00:33:47,697 --> 00:33:50,742
What sort of expression
is the lad wearing on his face?

454
00:33:51,243 --> 00:33:53,286
Can you fly a chopper?

455
00:33:53,411 --> 00:33:57,415
l have, but l'm certainly not licensed
in any way, shape or form.

456
00:33:57,499 --> 00:33:59,876
Great. Let's go.

457
00:34:08,134 --> 00:34:10,178
When was this whirlybird last serviced?

458
00:34:10,262 --> 00:34:13,765
l don't know. Klaus is supposed
to check it every six months.

459
00:34:21,606 --> 00:34:25,777
You're back on the water, boys. The wire
transfer came through from Kentucky,

460
00:34:25,861 --> 00:34:28,989
and Jackman and Wordsley
are going to gap-finance the rest.

461
00:34:29,072 --> 00:34:33,535
But we have a few hooks on it,
so take a pew for a spell.

462
00:34:33,618 --> 00:34:36,997
Number one, the bank want a drug screen
for everyone on the crew

463
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,331
before they'll forward the money.

464
00:34:38,456 --> 00:34:40,750
- A piss test?
- Yes, a piss test.

465
00:34:40,834 --> 00:34:43,128
Two, a stooge from the bond company

466
00:34:43,211 --> 00:34:47,132
will be riding everywhere during
the whole shoot to keep you on budget.

467
00:34:47,215 --> 00:34:50,093
- Who's the stooge?
- A chap by the name of Bill Ubell.

468
00:34:50,177 --> 00:34:52,554
And there's not a damn thing
you can do about that, Steve.

469
00:34:52,637 --> 00:34:55,307
Three, you must swear,
legally swear,

470
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:57,934
that you'll not kill that shark,
or whatever it is,

471
00:34:58,018 --> 00:34:59,895
if it actually exists.

472
00:35:02,189 --> 00:35:04,983
l'm going to fight it,
but l'll let it live.

473
00:35:05,066 --> 00:35:07,736
- What about my dynamite?
- Phillip, dynamite.

474
00:35:07,819 --> 00:35:10,947
l'm off to Zurich.
Follow me, chaps.

475
00:35:11,031 --> 00:35:16,077
Mr Ubell, l'd like for you to know
Steve Zissou and our equity partner Ned.

476
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,964
l hope you're not gonna
bust our chops, Bill.

477
00:35:28,048 --> 00:35:33,762
- Why would l do that?
- Because you're a bond-company stooge.

478
00:35:33,845 --> 00:35:36,223
Well, l'm also a human being.

479
00:35:37,516 --> 00:35:39,643
All right, l take that back.

480
00:35:39,726 --> 00:35:41,186
Yeah.

481
00:35:42,187 --> 00:35:44,731
Let's have some teamsmanship.

482
00:35:48,735 --> 00:35:50,779
Ho!

483
00:37:22,913 --> 00:37:23,997
1 , 2, 3.

484
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,082
Come on.

485
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:33,715
1 , 2, 3.

486
00:37:33,798 --> 00:37:35,175
Attaboy. Attaboy.

487
00:37:35,258 --> 00:37:37,469
Here he is. Here he is.
Come on.

488
00:37:37,552 --> 00:37:39,596
You OK, Ned? You OK?

489
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:42,682
All right, give him some room.
He's OK.

490
00:37:42,766 --> 00:37:45,810
He just drank a little too much water.

491
00:37:49,564 --> 00:37:51,691
How are you shooting this,
Vikram? Wide open?

492
00:37:51,775 --> 00:37:53,777
Light, 5/6.

493
00:38:06,164 --> 00:38:08,959
As always, even in
the most challenging circumstances,

494
00:38:09,042 --> 00:38:13,338
the members of Team Zissou
find ways to keep morale high.

495
00:38:18,218 --> 00:38:19,553
Wait. Hold it.

496
00:38:19,636 --> 00:38:21,638
ls that a distress bark?

497
00:38:25,684 --> 00:38:27,644
ls something wounded out there?

498
00:38:27,769 --> 00:38:32,148
We quickly locate
the source of the mysterious cry.

499
00:38:34,234 --> 00:38:37,821
- What is she, Steve?
- A wild snow mongoose.

500
00:38:37,946 --> 00:38:41,032
We thought they were extinct.
Her ankle's broken.

501
00:38:41,116 --> 00:38:42,492
- Ogata?
- Yeah.

502
00:38:42,576 --> 00:38:45,912
Run and get some hot milk
and put these guys in the incubator.

503
00:38:45,996 --> 00:38:50,709
We radio for the emergency
transport of our rare beautiful new friends.

504
00:38:53,295 --> 00:38:55,839
That's what it used to be like.

505
00:39:08,393 --> 00:39:13,440
Had Ned's heart stopped beating
before you pulled him out of the water?

506
00:39:13,565 --> 00:39:17,777
Had Ned's heart stopped beating
before we pulled him out of the water?

507
00:39:17,861 --> 00:39:21,531
Yes. But we got him
started again pretty quickly.

508
00:39:21,656 --> 00:39:24,618
Don't go on this voyage
right now, Steve.

509
00:39:24,701 --> 00:39:27,162
One of you is already dead,
after all.

510
00:39:27,287 --> 00:39:28,788
Who?

511
00:39:31,166 --> 00:39:32,792
Oh, you mean Esteban?

512
00:39:32,876 --> 00:39:35,337
Thanks for bringing that up.

513
00:39:38,798 --> 00:39:42,010
Who's gonna tell us the Latin names
of all the fishes and everything?

514
00:39:42,093 --> 00:39:44,304
You know l can't remember all that shit.

515
00:39:44,387 --> 00:39:46,848
Please stop, Eleanor.
Eleanor, stop.

516
00:39:46,932 --> 00:39:48,266
Why are you leaving?

517
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:51,102
l don't want to be a part of
whatever's gonna happen out there.

518
00:39:51,186 --> 00:39:53,480
Nobody knows what's going to happen,
and then we film it.

519
00:39:53,563 --> 00:39:56,900
- That's the whole concept.
- That's how we've always done it.

520
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,111
l can't believe you took that boy's money.

521
00:40:00,195 --> 00:40:02,155
He's an investor.

522
00:40:02,489 --> 00:40:04,866
He's my sidekick.

523
00:40:05,492 --> 00:40:07,786
The sugar crabs are back.

524
00:40:09,704 --> 00:40:11,832
They're early this year.

525
00:40:11,915 --> 00:40:15,252
l've never seen them mating
before the solstice.

526
00:40:15,377 --> 00:40:17,921
ls that mating?

527
00:40:24,177 --> 00:40:26,137
Goodbye, Steve.

528
00:40:27,764 --> 00:40:31,601
Don't say that.
Even if it's true... don't say that.

529
00:40:31,726 --> 00:40:35,313
- lt's too painful.
- What do you want me to say?

530
00:40:37,524 --> 00:40:39,484
Say bon voyage.

531
00:40:44,114 --> 00:40:46,116
Bon voyage.

532
00:41:24,696 --> 00:41:26,656
Kingsley Ned Zissou, 29,

533
00:41:26,781 --> 00:41:29,242
junior-grade diving tech,
executive producer.

534
00:41:29,367 --> 00:41:31,495
Energetic, spirited, youthful.

535
00:41:34,331 --> 00:41:39,044
Normally we would track the jaguar shark
with the scanning monitor,

536
00:41:39,127 --> 00:41:43,048
but its power tubes have seized up
and blown a gasket.

537
00:41:44,174 --> 00:41:49,763
We proceed to the more advanced system
located on a colleague's offshore facility.

538
00:41:51,806 --> 00:41:54,893
This will be Team Zissou's next stop.

539
00:42:00,232 --> 00:42:03,902
See, Renzo, this is what l'm talking about -
a relationship subplot.

540
00:42:03,985 --> 00:42:07,113
There's chemistry between us, you know?

541
00:42:09,991 --> 00:42:11,868
- Here's a quote.
- Wait. Who from?

542
00:42:11,993 --> 00:42:15,580
''Zissou has an almost magical connection
to the life of the sea.''

543
00:42:15,664 --> 00:42:21,336
''He speaks its language fluently.
l've never met a boy like that in all my life.''

544
00:42:21,419 --> 00:42:24,756
- Lord Mandrake.
- You should have opened with that one.

545
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:29,010
- He was your mentor.
- Hey, intern, get me a Campari, will ya?

546
00:42:29,094 --> 00:42:31,805
On the rocks?

547
00:42:32,889 --> 00:42:34,933
You wanna go up in my balloon?

548
00:42:37,769 --> 00:42:42,482
- l like her hairdo.
- Me too, but Steve called it first.

549
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:50,073
- l'm sorry l made you cry the other day.
- Oh.

550
00:42:50,157 --> 00:42:53,076
That's OK. lt's not completely
your fault anyway.

551
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,704
l'm going through
some personal problems.

552
00:42:55,787 --> 00:42:57,831
Really? What do you got?

553
00:42:57,956 --> 00:43:01,793
Well, l'm... five months pregnant.
My editor's the father.

554
00:43:01,918 --> 00:43:05,964
He's married, but... not to me.

555
00:43:06,047 --> 00:43:09,092
Wow. That's a rough ticket.

556
00:43:09,176 --> 00:43:13,013
You know, my first wife left me
when l was your age.

557
00:43:15,807 --> 00:43:18,560
- What's Deep Search?
- My submarine.

558
00:43:21,396 --> 00:43:26,109
l had this image of you on the wall above
my aquarium all through primary school.

559
00:43:26,193 --> 00:43:30,989
Oh, yeah? You mean the official
photograph, where l'm doing this?

560
00:43:31,072 --> 00:43:33,742
That's the one.

561
00:43:33,825 --> 00:43:37,662
Well, maybe it's just me,
but l don't feel like that person.

562
00:43:37,787 --> 00:43:39,915
l never did.

563
00:43:53,136 --> 00:43:55,430
Why did you abandon Ned?

564
00:43:57,474 --> 00:44:00,185
l didn't. l never even met him.

565
00:44:03,313 --> 00:44:06,733
What kind of piece are you writing, cubbie?

566
00:44:07,192 --> 00:44:09,152
Are you gonna screw us on this deal?

567
00:44:10,737 --> 00:44:13,365
l hope not.

568
00:44:19,538 --> 00:44:25,126
You really think it's cool to hit the sauce
when you got a bun in the oven?

569
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:27,420
Pele, bring us back down, please.

570
00:44:32,509 --> 00:44:35,345
l don't have a problem
with objective reporting.

571
00:44:35,428 --> 00:44:38,640
What l have a problem with
is some wombat coming on my boat,

572
00:44:38,723 --> 00:44:44,729
trying to railroad me. Why don't you see
if you can get one of these dolphins

573
00:44:44,813 --> 00:44:48,150
to swim under the hull and give us a look.

574
00:44:56,575 --> 00:45:00,620
Nah. Either they can't hear us,
or they don't understand.

575
00:45:02,122 --> 00:45:05,125
Son of a bitch. l'm sick of these dolphins.

576
00:45:07,627 --> 00:45:10,005
Quiet out there tonight.

577
00:45:10,088 --> 00:45:14,092
Can you hear the jack whales singing?

578
00:45:14,176 --> 00:45:16,928
Beautiful. l wonder what they're saying.

579
00:45:17,012 --> 00:45:20,098
That was the sludge tanker, but...

580
00:45:20,182 --> 00:45:22,934
There you go. That's them.

581
00:45:26,396 --> 00:45:31,193
By the way, would you mind if l made a few
modifications to the Team Zissou insignia?

582
00:45:31,276 --> 00:45:33,403
- l have some ideas.
- You mean the patch?

583
00:45:33,528 --> 00:45:35,655
Yes. The insignia.

584
00:45:35,739 --> 00:45:38,950
Yeah. lt's probably kind of dated, isn't it?

585
00:45:39,034 --> 00:45:42,037
Sure. Take a crack at it.
Make it a little trendier.

586
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:46,416
All right.

587
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:53,673
Are you finding what you were looking for
out here with me?

588
00:45:53,757 --> 00:45:55,967
l hope so.

589
00:45:57,594 --> 00:46:00,388
l wrote you a letter about 1 7 years ago.

590
00:46:02,182 --> 00:46:05,060
You mean like a fan letter?

591
00:46:06,019 --> 00:46:08,230
Did l write you back?

592
00:46:08,355 --> 00:46:11,441
l try to answer as many personally as l can.

593
00:46:11,525 --> 00:46:15,529
''Dear Ned Plimpton, first,
in answer to your question - always.''

594
00:46:15,612 --> 00:46:18,865
''Second, thank you very much
for naming your bug after me.''

595
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:21,827
''My wife tells me
it is actually a type of gnat.''

596
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:26,289
''You strike me as a very special boy
and a key member of the Zissou Society.''

597
00:46:26,373 --> 00:46:30,669
''l wish l could come visit you in Kentucky
and assist you with your work.''

598
00:46:30,752 --> 00:46:34,506
''l remember your mother.
Take care of yourself, Ned Plimpton.''

599
00:46:34,589 --> 00:46:38,009
''You've served well.
Your friend, Captain Steve Zissou.''

600
00:46:38,134 --> 00:46:40,595
''Dictated but not read.''

601
00:46:44,015 --> 00:46:47,435
Yeah, more or less
standard boilerplate, l guess.

602
00:46:49,729 --> 00:46:53,233
There's some real high-tech gear
inside this deal, believe me.

603
00:46:53,316 --> 00:46:58,113
First we turn on that tracking system, then
as long as the batteries haven't gone...

604
00:46:58,238 --> 00:47:01,575
- Who locked us out?
- No one. We're trespassing.

605
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:05,787
- Steve, are we allowed in here?
- lt's a scientific community, man.

606
00:47:05,871 --> 00:47:10,417
Captain, l am required by law to notify
the bank of any illegal activities.

607
00:47:10,542 --> 00:47:13,295
Just do what you gotta do
to cover your ass, Bill.

608
00:47:13,378 --> 00:47:15,338
Got it.

609
00:47:22,512 --> 00:47:26,183
Fuck! They wired it. Klaus, go down
and get me some cable snippers.

610
00:47:26,308 --> 00:47:30,228
This is Captain Hennessey.
You have trespassed on a private facility.

611
00:47:30,312 --> 00:47:32,689
The Coast Guard is being alerted.

612
00:47:32,772 --> 00:47:35,984
Again, this is Captain Hennessey.
lmmediately leave...

613
00:47:39,613 --> 00:47:42,949
OK, action. Well, look who's back in town.

614
00:47:43,033 --> 00:47:46,369
You travelled over 1 50 miles since we last
heard from you.

615
00:47:46,453 --> 00:47:48,580
lt's heading for the South Pacific.

616
00:47:49,831 --> 00:47:51,166
Turn on your tape recorder.

617
00:47:51,249 --> 00:47:54,628
- ls it the jaguar shark?
- On the record, yes.

618
00:47:54,711 --> 00:47:57,380
Cut. Print both takes, Vikram.

619
00:47:57,464 --> 00:48:01,593
- Was l just in the film?
- Yeah. You have to sign a release.

620
00:48:01,676 --> 00:48:04,054
But you've actually located the shark.

621
00:48:04,137 --> 00:48:07,182
You better bet your ass we did.
All right, everybody,

622
00:48:07,265 --> 00:48:11,019
we got about 25-30 minutes before
the Coast Guard gets here to arrest us.

623
00:48:11,102 --> 00:48:15,023
l want you all to get Hennessey's
best gear onto the Belafonte in 1 5.

624
00:48:15,148 --> 00:48:18,568
- You're gonna steal his stuff?
- We'll get it back to him. lnterns,

625
00:48:18,652 --> 00:48:20,695
let's see some hustle.

626
00:48:20,779 --> 00:48:23,323
Uh, what is this, Pele?

627
00:48:24,324 --> 00:48:26,326
l don't know. Uh, it's a map.

628
00:48:26,409 --> 00:48:28,787
Steve.

629
00:48:28,912 --> 00:48:32,582
Do you know you just charted us on
a course through unprotected waters?

630
00:48:32,666 --> 00:48:36,920
- Yeah, we're taking the shortcut.
- But it's outside lMU jurisdiction.

631
00:48:37,003 --> 00:48:39,005
l know, honey. Look at the map.

632
00:48:39,089 --> 00:48:44,302
We go your way, that's about... 4 inches.
We go my way, it's an inch and a half.

633
00:48:44,427 --> 00:48:48,014
- You wanna pay for the extra gas?
- What kind of system is this?

634
00:48:48,139 --> 00:48:51,059
You have the Bernstein 9.
Just upgraded last summer.

635
00:48:51,142 --> 00:48:54,729
- The nines are out already?
- Does this do cappuccino?

636
00:48:54,813 --> 00:48:57,190
- Ja.
- Wait. This isn't the procedure.

637
00:49:00,193 --> 00:49:03,780
One of the interns just fell down the stairs
with the tracking processor.

638
00:49:03,864 --> 00:49:07,951
- Make sure we steal the backup.
- You listening? Under no circumstances...

639
00:49:08,034 --> 00:49:10,745
Shut up before you jinx us, Anne-Marie.

640
00:49:25,427 --> 00:49:27,804
You catching anything?

641
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,977
Hook this up and make me a latte.

642
00:49:39,608 --> 00:49:42,694
You know, Cubbie's kind of a suckermaker,

643
00:49:42,777 --> 00:49:45,447
but she's got some moves.

644
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:47,741
l agree.

645
00:49:47,824 --> 00:49:52,704
lf she wasn't a bull dyke, l think
l might have a bit of a thing for her.

646
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:09,679
As you can see, if the creature continues
its current migratory route,

647
00:50:09,804 --> 00:50:12,432
our paths should converge
in less than four days.

648
00:50:12,516 --> 00:50:17,187
- l wanna get there in three. Can we?
- Vladimir, what's this blip here?

649
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:20,607
l don't know.
We might have them mixed up.

650
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:25,195
lt could be the other way around. Anyway,
we're gonna be on top of it in the morning.

651
00:50:28,573 --> 00:50:33,537
- Good eye, Ned.
- Thank you. Should we investigate it?

652
00:50:33,662 --> 00:50:37,165
Yeah. Let's make a dive at 6am,
scope out the phantom signal.

653
00:50:37,249 --> 00:50:42,462
lt's probably one of Hennessey's turtles.
l wanna be back on the road by lunch.

654
00:50:46,091 --> 00:50:49,678
Do me a favour. Next time you get
a hot idea in front of the reporter,

655
00:50:49,761 --> 00:50:51,888
whisper it in my ear first.

656
00:50:51,972 --> 00:50:55,100
Otherwise l look like kind of
a daydream Johnny, you know?

657
00:50:55,183 --> 00:50:57,727
Daydream Johnny, yes.

658
00:50:57,853 --> 00:50:59,729
You let him change your name?

659
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:03,900
- Well, we changed it together.
- What was it before?

660
00:51:03,984 --> 00:51:06,736
- Edward Plimpton.
- That's a million times better.

661
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:11,116
Change it back, Ned.
l really don't see you as a Kingsley Zissou.

662
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:15,203
Do you think Steve and l
have a family resemblance?

663
00:51:15,287 --> 00:51:17,497
No.

664
00:51:17,581 --> 00:51:20,125
l guess it doesn't really matter anyway.

665
00:51:26,256 --> 00:51:28,383
Here.

666
00:51:28,466 --> 00:51:33,680
l stole it back... and strung it
on some peppermint dental floss

667
00:51:33,805 --> 00:51:36,808
in case you want to wear it
like a necklace.

668
00:51:57,787 --> 00:52:00,957
- Happy with the piece, Jane?
- What are you doing in here?

669
00:52:01,041 --> 00:52:03,418
Am l? No.

670
00:52:03,502 --> 00:52:06,463
- Put that down.
- l assume l'm Mr Z.

671
00:52:06,546 --> 00:52:12,802
l'm sorry that you think my red hat is, uh...
What's the word you use? ''Contrived.''

672
00:52:12,928 --> 00:52:14,971
And that...

673
00:52:15,055 --> 00:52:20,894
''The Zissou of my childhood represents
all the dreams l've come to regret''?

674
00:52:20,977 --> 00:52:25,398
- What? Why?
- l have to start locking my effing door.

675
00:52:25,482 --> 00:52:30,362
lt was locked. l kicked it in. Why don't
you just curse, like other people?

676
00:52:30,445 --> 00:52:33,949
l'm trying to get out of the habit
before l have my fucking baby.

677
00:52:34,074 --> 00:52:38,286
OK. That makes sense.
Well, please clean up your room, anyway.

678
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:41,957
- lt looks like a goddamn typhoon hit it.
- Oh, get out.

679
00:52:48,922 --> 00:52:52,968
Please don't make fun of me.
l just wanted to flirt with you.

680
00:52:53,051 --> 00:52:55,762
l'll have an intern come and fix the door.

681
00:53:09,109 --> 00:53:11,111
This is a message
from the lMU Coast Guard.

682
00:53:11,194 --> 00:53:15,031
Apparently some crooked fuckers
broke into my Sealab yesterday.

683
00:53:15,115 --> 00:53:17,242
How awful. Did they nick anything?

684
00:53:17,367 --> 00:53:21,997
lt doesn't say. Probably just trashed
the place. l'm so... pissed, l wanna spit.

685
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:26,710
Hugo... Tell Carl to load
my elephant gun with buckshot.

686
00:53:28,879 --> 00:53:31,339
We're gonna hunt down these sickos.

687
00:53:33,925 --> 00:53:36,803
Supposedly, Cousteau and his cronies
invented the idea

688
00:53:36,887 --> 00:53:39,264
of putting walkie-talkies into the helmet,

689
00:53:39,347 --> 00:53:44,394
but we made ours with a special rabbit ear
on the top so we could pipe in some music.

690
00:54:30,607 --> 00:54:33,777
Let's start with the reverse.

691
00:54:43,453 --> 00:54:45,580
OK, roll it, Vikram.

692
00:54:47,415 --> 00:54:51,419
Would it be possible for me to address
you as ''Dad'' in this scene?

693
00:54:51,503 --> 00:54:53,713
No. Why?

694
00:54:55,465 --> 00:54:58,635
Oh, excuse me. l'm sorry.
l forgot. l'm sorry.

695
00:54:58,718 --> 00:55:01,721
Where you coming from, jack-off? Shit.

696
00:55:02,597 --> 00:55:06,101
lt's not a bad impulse, though,
some kind of nickname.

697
00:55:07,143 --> 00:55:11,815
Not that one. lt's too specific.
But try to think of something else.

698
00:55:12,649 --> 00:55:15,193
Another name?

699
00:55:15,902 --> 00:55:18,363
How about ''Stevesie''?

700
00:55:18,446 --> 00:55:21,491
That's good. Try it.
What were you gonna say before?

701
00:55:24,619 --> 00:55:28,540
- Good luck, Stevesie.
- Fantastic. Let's go.

702
00:55:37,257 --> 00:55:39,551
OK, action.

703
00:55:45,473 --> 00:55:48,101
Look, Ned,
there's a sunken airplane down there.

704
00:55:48,185 --> 00:55:50,479
Let's check it out.

705
00:55:59,654 --> 00:56:05,577
We examine the site but are careful not to
disturb forensic evidence. How was that?

706
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:08,288
Not bad.
The first take was a little faster.

707
00:56:09,414 --> 00:56:11,374
ls it loose?

708
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,960
- Klaus. Klaus?
- Ja.

709
00:56:14,085 --> 00:56:16,546
May l have a word with you, please?

710
00:56:19,966 --> 00:56:21,635
What?

711
00:56:22,469 --> 00:56:24,679
- Why'd you do that?
- l owed you one.

712
00:56:24,804 --> 00:56:27,599
But you gave me a warning already.

713
00:56:27,682 --> 00:56:30,811
- You stood up for yourself.
- l still owed you one.

714
00:56:30,894 --> 00:56:34,397
- Now l owe you one.
- No. Now we're even.

715
00:56:34,523 --> 00:56:39,569
Why are you doing this? He's not
my father, you know. l don't have that.

716
00:56:39,694 --> 00:56:45,075
- What are you talkin' about?
- We're even, dammit. That's it!

717
00:57:04,553 --> 00:57:09,182
No, it was like a beat-up little jalopy.
l don't know what you'd call it.

718
00:57:09,307 --> 00:57:12,644
- You didn't see it?
- l didn't see it, boss.

719
00:57:12,727 --> 00:57:16,106
Well, keep your eyes peeled.

720
00:57:16,189 --> 00:57:19,276
Klaus, check who's on watch.
l'll be in the sauna.

721
00:57:20,527 --> 00:57:22,821
Pele and...

722
00:57:22,946 --> 00:57:25,740
Who the shit is Kingsley Zissou?

723
00:57:27,742 --> 00:57:30,120
- ls that him?
- That's him.

724
00:57:31,621 --> 00:57:35,125
l've never felt a baby
in someone's stomach before.

725
00:57:38,753 --> 00:57:41,965
l think you'll make
a very good single mother.

726
00:57:45,218 --> 00:57:47,512
- Thanks.
- Although it does put you both

727
00:57:47,596 --> 00:57:49,973
at a tremendous disadvantage.

728
00:58:06,364 --> 00:58:08,742
You know...

729
00:58:08,867 --> 00:58:11,661
Steve's got a little bit of a thing for you.

730
00:58:12,996 --> 00:58:15,123
Why do you say that?

731
00:58:15,248 --> 00:58:17,375
Because he told me.

732
00:58:17,459 --> 00:58:18,960
Really?

733
00:58:19,044 --> 00:58:22,339
l thought he hated my guts.

734
00:58:22,422 --> 00:58:24,799
Well, l think you hurt his feelings, but...

735
00:58:24,925 --> 00:58:27,135
He says l hurt his feelings?

736
00:58:29,763 --> 00:58:33,934
So... effed up.

737
00:59:05,757 --> 00:59:07,342
Five...

738
00:59:07,425 --> 00:59:09,094
four...

739
00:59:09,177 --> 00:59:10,846
three...

740
00:59:10,929 --> 00:59:12,597
two...

741
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:44,671
Yeah?

742
00:59:44,796 --> 00:59:47,716
Steve, would you please open the door?

743
01:00:01,104 --> 01:00:04,858
Jane, is, uh, Ned in there?

744
01:00:08,069 --> 01:00:09,905
Stevesie?

745
01:00:09,988 --> 01:00:13,492
Stevesie, what's happening?
Are those hijackers?!

746
01:00:13,617 --> 01:00:16,536
Well, we call them ''pirates'' out here, Ned.

747
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:18,997
You were supposed to be
on watch, by the way.

748
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:23,084
Oh, my God, you're right. Stevesie, look...

749
01:00:25,128 --> 01:00:26,713
Whoa! No!

750
01:00:28,256 --> 01:00:30,634
So you were reading
to each other in French?

751
01:00:30,717 --> 01:00:33,178
No, it's in English. lt was translated.

752
01:00:33,303 --> 01:00:36,556
You're not supposed to go
into each other's cabins on a boat.

753
01:00:36,681 --> 01:00:40,602
- Why not?
- lt's just kind of an unwritten maritime rule

754
01:00:40,727 --> 01:00:42,729
when you're at sea.

755
01:00:42,813 --> 01:00:45,273
Especially the goddamn lookout.

756
01:00:45,357 --> 01:00:47,984
- l'm so sorry.
- So am l.

757
01:00:48,068 --> 01:00:50,362
You hung us out to dry.

758
01:00:52,447 --> 01:00:57,410
lf we don't handle this right,
we're gonna all get murdered,

759
01:00:57,536 --> 01:01:00,622
including her unborn British child.

760
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:09,923
l'm gonna kill you for that, asshole!

761
01:01:10,006 --> 01:01:14,219
l'm gonna hit you so fucking hard,
you'll be blind!

762
01:01:15,512 --> 01:01:17,806
Please don't hurt him!

763
01:01:21,268 --> 01:01:23,895
Watch me. l'll let you know
when l'm gonna move.

764
01:01:23,979 --> 01:01:28,150
lt's safer to do what they say. They
probably just want our money and jewels.

765
01:01:28,233 --> 01:01:33,822
Yeah, then how am l gonna finish
my movie, then? Jesus. Holy fuck.

766
01:01:33,905 --> 01:01:38,285
- They're going to kill us, Steve.
- l'm patting you on the back now, Klausy.

767
01:01:38,368 --> 01:01:43,331
Don't be scared. l'm gonna get us through
this, everybody. Ogata. Como esta. Pel?

768
01:01:47,002 --> 01:01:50,505
Wake up, Ned-o! l'm sorry l yelled at you.

769
01:01:51,173 --> 01:01:55,177
l need to speak with the man in charge.

770
01:01:55,260 --> 01:02:01,224
Don't point that gun at him. He's an unpaid
intern. Vikram, what coverage you get?

771
01:02:01,308 --> 01:02:05,770
l kept rolling till they put this hood on me.

772
01:02:06,855 --> 01:02:09,691
Bill speaks their language.
What are they saying?

773
01:02:09,774 --> 01:02:11,735
Hold on.

774
01:02:17,115 --> 01:02:21,119
OK. Apparently they're taking a hostage.
Obviously they've chosen Ned.

775
01:02:24,789 --> 01:02:30,003
Now that they've found out l speak Filipino,
they seem to be changing their minds.

776
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:38,094
- Do you have a vault? They wanna know.
- There's no vault.

777
01:02:38,178 --> 01:02:42,599
Our vault contains at least ten different
currencies from all over the world,

778
01:02:42,682 --> 01:02:47,270
and we are prepared for every kind
of financial necessity.

779
01:02:48,188 --> 01:02:51,066
There goes Ned's inheritance.

780
01:02:51,149 --> 01:02:56,530
Tell them if they don't get off my boat right
now, there's gonna be a major shit storm.

781
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:12,671
Ned-o, can you hear me?!
We'll get you back, Billy.

782
01:03:12,754 --> 01:03:15,423
ls everybody else safe?
Anne-Marie, are you OK?

783
01:03:15,507 --> 01:03:19,344
No, l'm not. l told you
these were unprotected waters.

784
01:03:19,427 --> 01:03:21,721
What a fuckin' nightmare.

785
01:03:24,724 --> 01:03:29,771
Be cool on this shit, OK, cubbie?
l mean, at least try to show both sides.

786
01:03:29,896 --> 01:03:32,607
l need to find a baby for this father.

787
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:35,527
Yeah, l think l know what you mean.

788
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:53,628
Here we go.

789
01:03:53,712 --> 01:03:58,425
- Steve... what are you...
- l said get your ass the hell off of my boat!

790
01:05:04,282 --> 01:05:08,328
l've never seen a bond-company stooge
stick his neck out like that.

791
01:05:17,712 --> 01:05:20,465
What's that sound? ls that...?

792
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:23,510
The arctic night lights, yeah.

793
01:05:23,593 --> 01:05:28,640
''As if the natural world's been
turned upside down.'' Lord Mandrake.

794
01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:36,189
Vikram, get some cutaways of this miracle.

795
01:05:36,273 --> 01:05:39,943
Klaus, Ogata, put out
the deck fires before we sink.

796
01:05:42,195 --> 01:05:46,825
Those fucking amateurs.
You left your dog, you idiots.

797
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:54,916
Wrap this stiff in a tablecloth.
We're gonna bury him at sea.

798
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,129
Shouldn't we give him
to the authorities or something?

799
01:05:59,212 --> 01:06:01,339
No.

800
01:06:01,423 --> 01:06:03,967
l'll write up a few words to read over him.

801
01:06:05,010 --> 01:06:07,888
How you holding up there, intern?
Doing OK?

802
01:06:11,475 --> 01:06:14,811
Ned, how many fingers am l holding up?

803
01:06:14,936 --> 01:06:17,647
l don't know. That's not my job.

804
01:06:18,523 --> 01:06:23,487
- Too many to tell. How many fingers...
- He's gonna be just fine.

805
01:06:31,036 --> 01:06:36,666
l believe it's criminal that Steve allowed this
to happen to us, by which l mean illegal.

806
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:42,380
We're being led on an illegal suicide
mission by a selfish maniac.

807
01:06:42,464 --> 01:06:46,510
l hear what you're saying,
but l think you misjudge the guy.

808
01:06:51,515 --> 01:06:54,267
Saint Paul said to the Corinthians:

809
01:06:54,351 --> 01:06:59,689
''Without kin, no man may regard
himself kindly. Without s...''

810
01:06:59,773 --> 01:07:01,983
Holy shit! Son of a bitch. Cut.

811
01:07:04,778 --> 01:07:10,575
This is Captain Hennessey. We've come
in response to your distress signal...

812
01:07:12,828 --> 01:07:15,372
Good God, is that you, Steven?

813
01:07:16,414 --> 01:07:20,001
Run downstairs, put a tarp over anything
that says ''Hennessey'' on it.

814
01:07:20,085 --> 01:07:24,089
- What about this guy?
- Just throw him over the other side.

815
01:07:29,636 --> 01:07:31,930
Your engine blew up
and your fuel's been stolen.

816
01:07:32,013 --> 01:07:33,557
Correct?

817
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:38,854
l know how you feel. Some crooked fuckers
just stripped my Sealab, you know.

818
01:07:38,937 --> 01:07:42,357
Probably the same dudes.

819
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:48,530
l can tow you as far as Port-au-Patois.
l'll need your signature on that invoice first.

820
01:07:48,613 --> 01:07:52,617
lt accounts for the expenses of the rescue,
my time and that of my crew.

821
01:07:52,701 --> 01:07:55,078
This is more than the budget of my project.

822
01:07:55,162 --> 01:07:57,622
lt's an estimate. What's your dog's name?

823
01:08:01,668 --> 01:08:03,962
Cody.

824
01:08:07,966 --> 01:08:09,926
Be still, Cody.

825
01:08:15,056 --> 01:08:17,434
l have to run this by
my bond-company stooge.

826
01:08:17,517 --> 01:08:21,605
- He's been kidnapped.
- That's true. l have to rescue him first.

827
01:08:21,688 --> 01:08:24,399
Sign it now, or l'm leaving you out here.

828
01:08:29,863 --> 01:08:33,116
Oh, l dined with Eleanor last weekend.

829
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:37,704
By the way, she's summering at my villa
in West Port-au-Patois, don't you know?

830
01:08:37,787 --> 01:08:40,957
Say, how's Team Zissou
holding up without her?

831
01:08:50,342 --> 01:08:54,429
The first thing that goes through a
captain's head when there's low morale is:

832
01:08:54,513 --> 01:08:57,933
''What'd l do? ls it all my fault?''

833
01:08:58,058 --> 01:09:02,270
Well, he's probably right.
Most of us have been together a long time.

834
01:09:02,354 --> 01:09:05,440
There are others
that were here before that.

835
01:09:05,524 --> 01:09:09,110
Do you all... not like me any more?

836
01:09:09,194 --> 01:09:13,323
l mean, what am l
supposed to do? l don't know.

837
01:09:13,406 --> 01:09:15,116
Look...

838
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:19,663
if you're not against me,
don't cross this line.

839
01:09:19,746 --> 01:09:22,290
lf yes, do.

840
01:09:22,374 --> 01:09:24,501
l love you all.

841
01:09:29,381 --> 01:09:31,842
- Are you sure?
- Yes, l am.

842
01:09:31,967 --> 01:09:33,927
l don't understand. Why?

843
01:09:34,052 --> 01:09:36,346
What do you mean?

844
01:09:36,429 --> 01:09:39,933
Wait a second. What are we doing?
You said cross the line if...

845
01:09:40,016 --> 01:09:43,603
- Cross the line if you're going to quit.
- Oh...

846
01:09:43,728 --> 01:09:46,565
Do it again. l misunderstood.

847
01:09:54,906 --> 01:09:57,033
Hi, Ross.
l got your corrections on the proofs.

848
01:09:57,117 --> 01:10:01,329
They're fine, but... l'm not coming back.

849
01:10:01,413 --> 01:10:03,957
lt's over.
Please don't try to contact me, OK?

850
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:06,334
You'll hear from us... sometime.

851
01:10:10,672 --> 01:10:13,300
We got attacked by pirates.

852
01:10:13,383 --> 01:10:15,760
l feel as if life has...

853
01:10:19,014 --> 01:10:23,393
Well, you get the idea.
Anyway, take care of yourself. Jane.

854
01:10:23,977 --> 01:10:26,062
Will you write to me?

855
01:10:26,146 --> 01:10:29,649
Of course. Give me the address.

856
01:10:29,774 --> 01:10:34,404
Actually, l went ahead and stamped and
self-addressed 50 or so envelopes

857
01:10:34,529 --> 01:10:38,450
just to make it easier for you.

858
01:10:38,575 --> 01:10:41,119
Thanks. l'll use them.

859
01:10:41,203 --> 01:10:44,206
Each one has three
blank pages in it, and...

860
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:48,835
there's a pen.

861
01:10:48,919 --> 01:10:52,839
Maybe l'm going to write you
a letter right now.

862
01:10:54,966 --> 01:10:56,801
OK.

863
01:11:05,685 --> 01:11:08,230
l bet l'm gonna really miss you, Ned.

864
01:11:10,482 --> 01:11:12,692
l'm gonna miss you, too.

865
01:11:12,818 --> 01:11:15,946
ln fact, l feel like... l don't know,

866
01:11:16,029 --> 01:11:19,783
l feel like my heart's almost getting broken.

867
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:22,369
l guess l'm overreacting.

868
01:11:25,789 --> 01:11:28,083
ls that really true?

869
01:11:30,126 --> 01:11:32,128
Yes, it is.

870
01:11:33,588 --> 01:11:37,509
That was all off the record, cubbie,
that whole deal.

871
01:11:37,634 --> 01:11:40,887
Actually, l'm surprised you didn't
cross the line yourself.

872
01:11:41,012 --> 01:11:43,765
- What line?
- The line l drew on the deck just now.

873
01:11:43,849 --> 01:11:46,935
- You weren't up there?
- No.

874
01:11:47,018 --> 01:11:48,979
You're kidding.

875
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:52,858
That was one of the most dramatic things
that's ever happened on this boat.

876
01:11:52,983 --> 01:11:57,445
l just lost all my best interns. l thought
you were supposed to be covering this.

877
01:11:57,529 --> 01:12:00,699
- You just said it was off the record.
- But you didn't know that.

878
01:12:00,782 --> 01:12:04,619
- l was down here packing.
- You're at the wrong breaker.

879
01:12:05,996 --> 01:12:08,957
So you are leaving.

880
01:12:09,666 --> 01:12:12,127
You're jumping ship on me.

881
01:12:12,210 --> 01:12:14,588
l'm going to scrap the article.

882
01:12:14,713 --> 01:12:18,383
You mean you're not even gonna
write the cover story on me?

883
01:12:18,508 --> 01:12:20,802
Man, l don't have any stature any more.

884
01:12:20,886 --> 01:12:24,931
Sorry, Steve. Everything just got
too weird, that's all.

885
01:12:25,015 --> 01:12:28,768
But l gave you a goddamn
show-stopper up there.

886
01:12:30,770 --> 01:12:33,315
Are you sleeping with Ned?

887
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:37,277
- That's none of your business.
- OK. Are you?

888
01:12:37,402 --> 01:12:39,404
No, l'm not.

889
01:12:42,282 --> 01:12:46,536
You're gonna miss the jaguar shark
or whatever it is if it actually exists.

890
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:49,873
Are you crying?

891
01:12:52,125 --> 01:12:54,878
You cry easily, don't you?

892
01:12:54,961 --> 01:12:58,798
Bloody hell,
God save that poor little stooge.

893
01:12:58,882 --> 01:13:01,426
This never would've happened
if Eleanor was with us.

894
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:05,347
- Thanks, man.
- Your luck had better change soon, mate.

895
01:13:05,472 --> 01:13:08,266
Now l must away. l'll send you a postcard.

896
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:11,853
- What? Where are you going?
- Abroad for a spell, my darling.

897
01:13:11,978 --> 01:13:16,942
lt's my passport status, you see. l'm X-9
at the moment. Legally, l'm a fugitive.

898
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:21,238
Wait a second.
They stole my budget, my boat's broken,

899
01:13:21,321 --> 01:13:25,450
you're ditchin' me up the creek.
What am l supposed to do here?

900
01:13:25,534 --> 01:13:27,911
Well, l must say,
nothing's jumping to mind.

901
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:31,414
Phillip, any suggestions?
No, he's shaking his head.

902
01:13:32,916 --> 01:13:36,753
Land ho!
Port-au-Patois, dead ahead.

903
01:13:37,295 --> 01:13:41,675
Port-au-Patois. Port-au-Patois ho!

904
01:13:41,758 --> 01:13:43,760
Ho!

905
01:13:44,135 --> 01:13:46,179
Ho!

906
01:13:46,263 --> 01:13:48,640
Land ho!

907
01:13:48,723 --> 01:13:50,350
Ho!

908
01:13:52,686 --> 01:13:57,357
No, l can't give you full credit,
but l'm not gonna flunk you, either.

909
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,985
You're all getting ''incompletes''.

910
01:14:02,028 --> 01:14:04,698
This is bullshit.

911
01:14:38,482 --> 01:14:41,526
Oh, shit. What do you want?

912
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:43,987
Do you mind if l butter you up
before l answer?

913
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:46,990
Yes, l do. Tell me now.

914
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:50,660
l need some money
to get the boat out of hock

915
01:14:50,785 --> 01:14:53,538
and rescue my bond-company stooge
who got kidnapped.

916
01:14:53,622 --> 01:14:56,750
Could we ask your parents to loan it to me?

917
01:14:56,833 --> 01:14:58,585
No.

918
01:14:59,794 --> 01:15:01,671
OK.

919
01:15:02,672 --> 01:15:06,801
Could l butter you up anyway?
lt took me two and a half hours to get here.

920
01:15:10,263 --> 01:15:13,767
- Who's that dude?
- lt's my research assistant, Javier.

921
01:15:13,850 --> 01:15:16,603
Javier, te presento Steve.

922
01:15:17,854 --> 01:15:19,856
Steve.

923
01:15:24,569 --> 01:15:31,243
- Necesito cinco minutos.
- l'd be jealous about you staying at Ali's

924
01:15:31,326 --> 01:15:33,870
except l always thought
he was a closet queer.

925
01:15:35,622 --> 01:15:38,959
So how's your father-son relationship
coming along?

926
01:15:39,042 --> 01:15:43,338
Well, nobody has a real lock on any of this,
so l don't know how it all times out.

927
01:15:43,421 --> 01:15:46,925
l mean, l know l want him
to think of me like a father.

928
01:15:47,008 --> 01:15:49,219
But the fact that there's a chance

929
01:15:49,344 --> 01:15:54,141
that he could really be
my actual... biological son...

930
01:15:57,185 --> 01:15:59,563
..is very difficult for me.

931
01:16:05,986 --> 01:16:10,782
You know l'm not big on apologizing,
so l'll just skip it, if it's all the same to you.

932
01:16:10,907 --> 01:16:11,908
OK.

933
01:16:12,033 --> 01:16:14,327
But anyway, l'm sorry.

934
01:16:15,996 --> 01:16:19,749
l know l haven't been at my best
this past decade.

935
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:21,585
That's true.

936
01:16:23,753 --> 01:16:26,631
What happened to me?

937
01:16:26,715 --> 01:16:29,676
Did l lose my talent?

938
01:16:29,759 --> 01:16:32,387
Am l ever gonna be good again?

939
01:16:33,513 --> 01:16:35,515
l don't know.

940
01:16:37,559 --> 01:16:41,938
Doesn't matter, anyway. lt's probably
the last adventure l've got in me.

941
01:16:42,022 --> 01:16:48,069
l was hoping to go out in a flash of blazes,
but l'll probably just end up going home.

942
01:16:48,153 --> 01:16:51,448
Unless you're planning to sell the island.

943
01:16:51,531 --> 01:16:54,493
l wonder how much l could get for it.

944
01:16:54,576 --> 01:16:56,536
ln this market?

945
01:16:58,788 --> 01:17:03,168
You were probably right all along.
We should've had a kid together.

946
01:17:03,251 --> 01:17:07,297
Of course, you were kinda already...

947
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:09,758
on the edge of being too old.

948
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,094
Unless maybe that's a cop-out.

949
01:17:17,641 --> 01:17:20,352
lt's worse than a cop-out. l was 34.

950
01:17:25,857 --> 01:17:27,818
lt's good to see you, Eleanor.

951
01:17:31,905 --> 01:17:33,907
l'm about to blow my stack.

952
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:36,701
l turn my back, and the bullshit begins.

953
01:17:36,785 --> 01:17:38,829
Ned, you're a scumbag.

954
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:42,332
And, Jane, you're a goddamn liar.

955
01:17:42,415 --> 01:17:44,459
What the fuck are you doing in here?

956
01:17:44,543 --> 01:17:46,920
What the F are you doing in here?

957
01:17:47,003 --> 01:17:51,174
l warned you about being in other people's
cabins. You were supposed to go home.

958
01:17:51,258 --> 01:17:55,554
You convinced me to stay
and finish the story.

959
01:17:55,637 --> 01:17:59,724
- ls it still the cover?
- l don't fucking know.

960
01:18:01,393 --> 01:18:04,813
Don't you dare put on that uniform.

961
01:18:05,397 --> 01:18:07,315
lt's all l have with me.

962
01:18:07,399 --> 01:18:11,528
l told you l have a bit of a thing for her.
''Not this one,'' l said.

963
01:18:11,611 --> 01:18:14,656
You said, ''Not this one, Klaus.''

964
01:18:14,739 --> 01:18:18,034
- So you heard me?
- You're too old for me, Steve.

965
01:18:18,827 --> 01:18:23,206
- Well, you're pregnant.
- Can l have a word with you privately?

966
01:18:23,290 --> 01:18:25,083
Yes.

967
01:18:29,337 --> 01:18:31,339
Follow me.

968
01:18:34,926 --> 01:18:38,513
- Are you two fighting?
- l'll deal with you later.

969
01:18:39,514 --> 01:18:42,058
Look, Steve, l know we both like her

970
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:46,104
and you're angry and embarrassed,
but leave her out of it.

971
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:50,984
You think that's what this is about? Shit,
what has that bull dyke been telling you?

972
01:18:51,109 --> 01:18:55,113
All right, l'm gonna warn you now,
be a gentleman.

973
01:18:55,197 --> 01:18:58,033
What are you doing here?
l thought you interns ran out.

974
01:18:58,116 --> 01:19:01,870
- l wanna help you find that shark.
- Goddammit. Thank you, intern.

975
01:19:01,995 --> 01:19:04,289
- You're gettin' an A.
- His name's Nico.

976
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:06,500
- Who?
- Hello, Vikram.

977
01:19:06,583 --> 01:19:11,296
Gimme that camera.
l'm gonna smash it over your head.

978
01:19:11,379 --> 01:19:13,924
Cut!

979
01:19:14,007 --> 01:19:18,053
l misread you, man.
l'm gonna have to rethink some shit.

980
01:19:18,136 --> 01:19:20,764
You don't know me.
You never wanted to know me.

981
01:19:20,847 --> 01:19:24,100
l'm just a character in your film.

982
01:19:24,226 --> 01:19:27,646
lt's a documentary.
lt's all really happening.

983
01:19:27,771 --> 01:19:30,065
Well, damn you for that.

984
01:19:32,192 --> 01:19:34,569
Go to bed, you sons of bitches.

985
01:19:38,698 --> 01:19:41,743
That pregnant slut's been playing us
like a cheap fiddle.

986
01:19:41,827 --> 01:19:44,120
That's it. l'm gonna fight you, Steve.

987
01:19:46,790 --> 01:19:49,000
You never say, ''l'm gonna fight you.''

988
01:19:49,125 --> 01:19:52,546
You just smile and act natural,
and then you sucker-punch him.

989
01:19:52,629 --> 01:19:59,052
- You fight your way, and l'll fight mine.
- Oh, listen, Ned. Don't you try...

990
01:20:02,305 --> 01:20:06,518
l think your Team Zissou ring
might've caught me on the lip.

991
01:20:09,312 --> 01:20:13,233
You call yourself my son, but...

992
01:20:13,358 --> 01:20:15,735
l just don't see it.

993
01:20:15,819 --> 01:20:18,780
lt's nothing personal.

994
01:20:18,864 --> 01:20:21,158
What do you want?

995
01:20:22,868 --> 01:20:24,953
Nothing.

996
01:20:25,036 --> 01:20:29,666
That's so arrogant.
That's... Screw off.

997
01:20:29,749 --> 01:20:33,086
l can't believe l asked
if l could call you ''Dad''.

998
01:20:33,170 --> 01:20:36,298
- Of course you said no.
- l let you call me Stevesie.

999
01:20:36,381 --> 01:20:38,675
lt sounds better.

1000
01:20:40,844 --> 01:20:43,305
lt doesn't mean the same thing.

1001
01:20:47,559 --> 01:20:50,187
A week before she killed herself,
my mother told me

1002
01:20:50,270 --> 01:20:54,274
that you'd known about me
since the day l was born.

1003
01:20:54,357 --> 01:20:56,568
ls that a fact?

1004
01:20:57,486 --> 01:21:00,280
That's a fact.

1005
01:21:00,363 --> 01:21:04,284
l ought to have stayed
in Kentucky where l belong.

1006
01:21:09,873 --> 01:21:12,626
Quiet.

1007
01:21:12,709 --> 01:21:15,545
Somebody pay for this water taxi.

1008
01:21:18,798 --> 01:21:20,801
You got any petty cash on you?

1009
01:21:23,345 --> 01:21:26,056
Remind me to send
Eleanor's parents a thank-you note

1010
01:21:26,139 --> 01:21:29,392
- on the good correspondence stock.
- OK.

1011
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:33,146
This is the message we received earlier

1012
01:21:33,230 --> 01:21:37,067
on our answering machine
at Pescespada lsland.

1013
01:21:39,152 --> 01:21:41,112
Bill Ubell here. l'm on a payphone.

1014
01:21:41,196 --> 01:21:43,240
l am blindfolded
and my arms are bound,

1015
01:21:43,365 --> 01:21:45,575
but a boy has been
kind enough to assist me,

1016
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:48,620
and there's not much chance
l'll get another call,

1017
01:21:48,703 --> 01:21:52,541
so l thought l would
ask if... What? No.

1018
01:21:57,170 --> 01:21:59,297
Well, thanks for checking in, Bill.

1019
01:21:59,422 --> 01:22:03,176
Next time, maybe you could
let us know where you're at.

1020
01:22:03,301 --> 01:22:08,181
Based on the quality of the connection,
the variety of wildlife in the background,

1021
01:22:08,306 --> 01:22:12,853
and the elapsed time between
Mr Ubell's capture and this message,

1022
01:22:12,936 --> 01:22:16,523
there's a good chance
he's on one of the Ping lslands.

1023
01:22:16,606 --> 01:22:20,110
There used to be
a four-star hotel on Little Ping.

1024
01:22:20,193 --> 01:22:23,780
But the entire island was destroyed
by a monsoon five years ago.

1025
01:22:23,905 --> 01:22:26,032
lt's been uninhabited ever since.

1026
01:22:26,116 --> 01:22:28,785
l know the place. Hotel Citroen.

1027
01:22:29,786 --> 01:22:33,790
Cubbie, l'd like to speak
on the record for a moment.

1028
01:22:33,874 --> 01:22:37,627
Eleanor has always been
the brains behind Team Zissou.

1029
01:22:37,752 --> 01:22:40,130
By the way, are you gonna
put in a good description

1030
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:42,966
of the command centre
l've set up down here?

1031
01:22:45,886 --> 01:22:49,931
OK, gang, that's the plan. Set a course
for Ping lsland, full speed ahead.

1032
01:22:50,015 --> 01:22:54,561
You'll need to hire a team of mechanics
to rebuild the engine first, of course.

1033
01:22:54,644 --> 01:22:57,314
l know.
l'm saying, after that.

1034
01:22:57,939 --> 01:23:00,233
Just because l've decided
to save your neck

1035
01:23:00,358 --> 01:23:03,570
and help you do this rescue
doesn't mean you've won me back.

1036
01:23:03,653 --> 01:23:05,780
Yes, ma'am.

1037
01:23:14,623 --> 01:23:16,666
Thanks.

1038
01:23:17,709 --> 01:23:21,463
ls the father out of the picture?

1039
01:23:21,546 --> 01:23:25,884
Actually, l was sort of terrified
about having this baby.

1040
01:23:25,967 --> 01:23:29,805
Right now, l'm not
really scared of anything.

1041
01:23:29,888 --> 01:23:33,892
- Maybe it's my hormones.
- That makes sense.

1042
01:23:35,685 --> 01:23:40,190
l'm gonna tell you something confidentially
which won't be mentioned again.

1043
01:23:40,273 --> 01:23:44,194
l'm pretty sure l'm the only person
who can say this, including Steve...

1044
01:23:44,277 --> 01:23:46,947
Never mind how l found out.
l'm a scientist.

1045
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:50,158
lt's the thing that puzzles me
about Ned's situation.

1046
01:23:50,242 --> 01:23:53,036
- What is it?
- Zissou shoots blanks.

1047
01:23:56,832 --> 01:24:01,253
l think maybe it's because
he spent half his life underwater.

1048
01:24:33,785 --> 01:24:36,788
Let's try track three against picture.

1049
01:24:42,794 --> 01:24:47,674
A reef surrounds the Ping lslands,
warning intruders to keep their distance.

1050
01:24:49,968 --> 01:24:53,221
Today, we discover
one of its victims off the coast of Ping 3.

1051
01:24:55,557 --> 01:25:00,687
Our colleague, Alistair Hennessey,
and his crew are nowhere to be found.

1052
01:25:00,812 --> 01:25:02,898
We will land at dawn.

1053
01:25:04,483 --> 01:25:06,193
Not bad.

1054
01:25:06,276 --> 01:25:08,487
We'll temp it with that, anyway.

1055
01:25:43,814 --> 01:25:46,107
All right, let's go.

1056
01:26:08,213 --> 01:26:10,048
Oh, shit. Swamp leeches.

1057
01:26:10,132 --> 01:26:13,135
Everybody check for swamp leeches
and pull 'em off.

1058
01:26:17,597 --> 01:26:19,891
Nobody else got hit? What's the deal?

1059
01:26:23,061 --> 01:26:26,273
What a shame.
They had a bartender here, Keno,

1060
01:26:26,356 --> 01:26:30,110
made the best rum Cannonball
l've ever tasted.

1061
01:26:30,235 --> 01:26:32,612
You ready, Vikram?

1062
01:26:33,905 --> 01:26:37,325
- About six and a half.
- All right, shall we do this?

1063
01:27:01,224 --> 01:27:04,311
Barometer's falling.
lt's gonna rain. We gotta be quick.

1064
01:27:04,394 --> 01:27:06,688
- Where are they?
- Unknown. Split into groups.

1065
01:27:06,771 --> 01:27:09,232
l'll take Ned, Ogata, and Wolodarsky.

1066
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:13,195
Thanks.
Thanks a lot for not picking me.

1067
01:27:13,278 --> 01:27:17,032
What? We're smack in the middle
of a lightning-strike rescue op, Klaus.

1068
01:27:17,157 --> 01:27:19,701
- What's the deal?
- l'm sick of being on B squad.

1069
01:27:19,784 --> 01:27:24,414
Listen, you may be on B squad,
but you're the B squad leader.

1070
01:27:25,415 --> 01:27:29,711
Don't you know me and Esteban
always thought of you as our baby brother?

1071
01:27:29,794 --> 01:27:32,756
l've always thought of you two as my dads.

1072
01:27:33,757 --> 01:27:37,177
Please don't let anyone
make fun of me for saying so.

1073
01:27:37,302 --> 01:27:41,848
l can't guarantee that, Klausy, but l'll try.
Can we get on with the manoeuvres now?

1074
01:27:42,641 --> 01:27:44,768
Wolodarsky, you got something?

1075
01:27:44,851 --> 01:27:46,895
Not yet.

1076
01:27:52,484 --> 01:27:54,528
Anybody see anybody?

1077
01:27:54,653 --> 01:27:56,530
Empty.

1078
01:28:00,784 --> 01:28:02,702
- Klaus, pirates?
- No.

1079
01:28:02,786 --> 01:28:05,247
l think this
whole place is deserted.

1080
01:28:05,372 --> 01:28:07,999
Shit. We played a bum hunch.

1081
01:28:08,083 --> 01:28:13,213
Fuck. OK, let's not get down on ourselves.
We got two more Ping lslands to check out,

1082
01:28:13,296 --> 01:28:15,841
except l don't know
if we have enough gas to do it.

1083
01:28:15,924 --> 01:28:19,678
Dammit, Steve!

1084
01:28:19,761 --> 01:28:22,305
This sucks.

1085
01:28:22,389 --> 01:28:25,058
l'm disappointed in myself.

1086
01:28:30,939 --> 01:28:35,735
My first wife, Jacqueline,
and l spent our honeymoon here.

1087
01:28:37,112 --> 01:28:39,489
Things are pretty different now.

1088
01:28:42,409 --> 01:28:44,786
All right, let's check out.

1089
01:28:50,667 --> 01:28:52,752
Did you get that, Vikram?

1090
01:28:52,836 --> 01:28:54,004
Uh, yeah.

1091
01:28:54,087 --> 01:28:57,757
Good. We'll give them
the reality this time.

1092
01:28:57,841 --> 01:29:01,678
A washed-up old man with no friends,
no distribution deal,

1093
01:29:01,803 --> 01:29:04,473
wife on the rocks,
people laughing at him,

1094
01:29:04,556 --> 01:29:06,766
feeling sorry for himself.

1095
01:29:07,142 --> 01:29:10,812
Can l have a word alone
with my son, please?

1096
01:29:12,564 --> 01:29:15,650
- Are you all right?
- Not really.

1097
01:29:18,195 --> 01:29:24,367
By the way, l've been trying to think of a
nickname that might mean the right thing.

1098
01:29:24,493 --> 01:29:26,536
l came up with ''Papa Steve''.

1099
01:29:36,922 --> 01:29:41,968
l'm sorry l never acknowledged
your existence all those years.

1100
01:29:42,093 --> 01:29:44,554
lt won't happen again.
l mean it.

1101
01:29:47,265 --> 01:29:49,726
You are my son to me.

1102
01:29:49,851 --> 01:29:52,312
Almost more so.

1103
01:29:53,355 --> 01:29:57,859
See, for me to meet a guy
like you at this time in my life...

1104
01:29:59,069 --> 01:30:01,738
l don't know. Uh... it's just...

1105
01:30:02,739 --> 01:30:05,992
l wanna communicate my feelings to you,

1106
01:30:06,117 --> 01:30:10,121
but... l think l might start to cry.

1107
01:30:12,624 --> 01:30:16,378
That's OK.

1108
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:19,631
There's something in the coat check.

1109
01:30:26,388 --> 01:30:28,932
Hey, Billy. You OK?

1110
01:30:29,057 --> 01:30:33,103
- Did you get my message?
- Yeah. lt was kinda garbled.

1111
01:30:40,694 --> 01:30:42,362
Jesus.

1112
01:30:42,445 --> 01:30:44,739
These pirates are monsters.

1113
01:30:44,865 --> 01:30:49,202
But remember, l shot one of their guys
in the neck last week and killed him, so...

1114
01:30:49,286 --> 01:30:51,580
l think we're OK, too.

1115
01:30:52,873 --> 01:30:53,957
Where's Cody?

1116
01:30:58,378 --> 01:31:00,380
Cody?

1117
01:31:15,187 --> 01:31:17,147
See you...

1118
01:31:18,565 --> 01:31:21,526
Steven, are you rescuing me?

1119
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:28,700
Fold.

1120
01:31:43,715 --> 01:31:46,009
Klaus, bring the dynamite.

1121
01:32:01,399 --> 01:32:05,070
They were in there after all!
Run! Go! Move now!

1122
01:32:16,414 --> 01:32:19,835
Vikram got some great footage
of your boat. l guess it's totalled?

1123
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:23,880
Perhaps. We're extremely well insured.
l'll probably come out ahead.

1124
01:32:23,964 --> 01:32:28,677
Although we'll obviously have
to crew up from scratch next time.

1125
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:31,555
They made soup of my research turtles.

1126
01:32:41,314 --> 01:32:43,692
Ogata, give some first aid to Pele.

1127
01:32:43,817 --> 01:32:46,361
Klausy, Ned-o.

1128
01:32:46,444 --> 01:32:50,031
Dig in and hold these rustlers off
while l call in the rendezvous.

1129
01:32:50,115 --> 01:32:51,616
We'll meet on the beach.

1130
01:32:53,118 --> 01:32:55,328
You're A squad.

1131
01:32:56,496 --> 01:32:59,666
Renzo, Renzo, Renzo.
Anybody, hello? Hello?

1132
01:32:59,749 --> 01:33:02,043
This gizmo's out of juice.

1133
01:33:05,088 --> 01:33:06,548
Thanks.

1134
01:33:11,136 --> 01:33:12,512
No, Captain.

1135
01:33:12,596 --> 01:33:15,390
That's Cedric. He's a friend.

1136
01:33:16,641 --> 01:33:18,518
Merci. Cedric.

1137
01:33:18,643 --> 01:33:21,271
Remind me, we'll send him
a red cap and a Speedo.

1138
01:33:24,024 --> 01:33:28,028
Wolodarsky, go get the keys to that
fishing boat and throw them in the water.

1139
01:33:28,111 --> 01:33:31,865
No, wait. They might have
another set. Just blow it up.

1140
01:33:34,075 --> 01:33:35,494
Hey, Ned.

1141
01:33:35,577 --> 01:33:38,788
lt looks like
we recovered your inheritance.

1142
01:33:39,831 --> 01:33:40,999
Klausy.

1143
01:33:52,219 --> 01:33:54,930
That's it. l'm retired.

1144
01:34:09,319 --> 01:34:11,947
Oh, no, we forgot Cody.
We gotta go back.

1145
01:34:18,912 --> 01:34:21,581
Goodbye, Cody.

1146
01:34:39,599 --> 01:34:43,603
See, this represents the Belafonte.
and here's Pescespada lsland,

1147
01:34:43,687 --> 01:34:46,148
and that circle represents friendship,

1148
01:34:46,273 --> 01:34:48,900
and the K here stands for Klaus.

1149
01:34:48,984 --> 01:34:51,444
Where's your symbol, Ned?

1150
01:34:51,528 --> 01:34:53,530
l didn't wanna impose myself.

1151
01:34:53,613 --> 01:34:57,200
Klaus is right.
The flag needs a Ned symbol.

1152
01:34:57,325 --> 01:35:01,872
l suppose we could put an N
on the side of that octopus.

1153
01:35:01,955 --> 01:35:04,499
What's that stand for over there?

1154
01:35:04,624 --> 01:35:06,334
That's Esteban.

1155
01:35:06,877 --> 01:35:09,171
lt was working OK until late last night,

1156
01:35:09,296 --> 01:35:12,632
but now the tracking system's
gone completely on the fritz.

1157
01:35:13,216 --> 01:35:18,722
Screw it. Sell it for scrap along with the
boat and the submarines. l'm going home.

1158
01:35:19,264 --> 01:35:22,392
Let's take up the whirlybird
and see what we find, anyway.

1159
01:35:22,476 --> 01:35:25,896
l got a feeling we can spot
this fish from 1 1 1 feet up.

1160
01:35:25,979 --> 01:35:29,733
Ned, l don't know
if l ever even saw the bastard.

1161
01:35:30,859 --> 01:35:34,779
l have $ 2 75,000 invested
in this damn production.

1162
01:35:34,863 --> 01:35:38,450
Something ate Esteban,
didn't it? Now lead!

1163
01:35:39,618 --> 01:35:41,661
Right?

1164
01:35:41,786 --> 01:35:43,997
Right? Ho!

1165
01:35:48,001 --> 01:35:48,502
Ho.

1166
01:36:08,021 --> 01:36:09,606
What's that?

1167
01:36:09,689 --> 01:36:11,733
Letter from Jane.

1168
01:36:11,817 --> 01:36:14,694
What does she say?

1169
01:36:14,778 --> 01:36:17,239
Nothing to speak of.

1170
01:36:26,081 --> 01:36:28,542
Thank you
for putting me on the flag, Ned.

1171
01:36:28,625 --> 01:36:31,086
Of course, Klaus. lt was my pleasure.

1172
01:36:31,169 --> 01:36:33,130
But you stitched me onto the dolphin,

1173
01:36:33,255 --> 01:36:35,882
and l want you to know
how much that means to me.

1174
01:36:35,966 --> 01:36:37,926
Well, l'm very pleased you liked it.

1175
01:36:38,009 --> 01:36:41,346
You're not listening!
l didn't just like it...

1176
01:36:47,769 --> 01:36:52,482
- You understand?
- Yes, l do. Thank you, Klaus.

1177
01:37:04,161 --> 01:37:06,371
l've still got yours, of course.

1178
01:37:06,496 --> 01:37:07,831
My what?

1179
01:37:13,211 --> 01:37:17,632
''Dear Captain Zissou, l am 1 2 years old
and live in Jawbone, Kentucky.''

1180
01:37:17,716 --> 01:37:20,594
''A creek runs behind our house,
where l live with my mother.''

1181
01:37:20,677 --> 01:37:22,429
''She met you once some years ago,

1182
01:37:22,512 --> 01:37:26,433
and l collect and catalogue
amphibians, reptiles and insects.''

1183
01:37:26,558 --> 01:37:29,519
''l don't know what
this one's called, so l named it.''

1184
01:37:29,603 --> 01:37:33,523
''You are probably my one of, if not
the favourite person l've ever studied.''

1185
01:37:33,607 --> 01:37:36,526
''l plan to be either
A: an oceanographer,

1186
01:37:36,610 --> 01:37:38,904
B: an architect,
C: a pilot.''

1187
01:37:38,987 --> 01:37:42,365
''Thank you for your good work.
Sincerely, Ned Plimpton,

1188
01:37:42,449 --> 01:37:44,743
Blue Star Cadet, Zissou Society.''

1189
01:37:44,826 --> 01:37:47,496
''PS: Do you ever wish
you could breathe underwater?''

1190
01:37:51,708 --> 01:37:54,669
l still wish l could breathe underwater.

1191
01:37:54,753 --> 01:37:56,546
Me, too, Ned.

1192
01:38:02,969 --> 01:38:06,473
- Fluorescent snapper.
- What? Really? What's that?

1193
01:38:06,598 --> 01:38:09,976
A good sign. The last time
we saw that big shitkicker here...

1194
01:38:16,149 --> 01:38:18,443
Something popped up there, didn't it?

1195
01:38:18,568 --> 01:38:21,238
l heard a pin snap loose
on the rotator mechanism.

1196
01:38:26,910 --> 01:38:29,371
This is gonna hurt.

1197
01:38:46,429 --> 01:38:47,430
Ned!

1198
01:38:48,431 --> 01:38:50,225
Ned!

1199
01:38:54,813 --> 01:38:57,691
- Ned.
- Hey, Stevesie.

1200
01:39:06,158 --> 01:39:08,118
Are you OK?

1201
01:39:09,161 --> 01:39:11,538
l think l'm OK.

1202
01:39:13,665 --> 01:39:16,626
What happened?
Did we hit something?

1203
01:39:17,627 --> 01:39:20,005
Most likely not.

1204
01:39:21,006 --> 01:39:23,717
l think maybe the pushrod failed.

1205
01:39:25,135 --> 01:39:29,264
l'm sorry, Ned. l should've
scrapped this chopper ten years ago.

1206
01:39:29,347 --> 01:39:34,561
Maybe l should've autorotated and
performed a high bank during our descent.

1207
01:39:34,686 --> 01:39:37,647
We might've crashed a little softer.

1208
01:39:39,107 --> 01:39:43,028
Probably wouldn't have made
any difference, though.

1209
01:40:51,179 --> 01:40:52,973
All hands, bury the dead.

1210
01:41:58,955 --> 01:42:03,168
This is the first time
Eleanor's ever cried in front of me.

1211
01:42:03,251 --> 01:42:06,338
Except for once when she got her arm
caught in the deck winch.

1212
01:42:07,964 --> 01:42:11,384
ls this my espresso machine?

1213
01:42:12,385 --> 01:42:15,388
How did you get
my espresso machine?

1214
01:42:15,472 --> 01:42:17,557
Well, uh...

1215
01:42:17,641 --> 01:42:19,935
We fucking stole it, man.

1216
01:42:23,188 --> 01:42:28,693
Ali, why don't you go powder your nose?
l need to talk to your ex-wife.

1217
01:42:33,490 --> 01:42:37,160
We've never made great husbands,
have we?

1218
01:42:37,285 --> 01:42:40,872
Of course, l have a good excuse.
l'm part gay.

1219
01:42:41,915 --> 01:42:44,209
Supposedly, everyone is.

1220
01:42:56,763 --> 01:42:59,641
l never told you this, but l was hoping...

1221
01:42:59,724 --> 01:43:04,187
we might get the chance to adopt Ned.
l think he would've wanted it that way.

1222
01:43:04,271 --> 01:43:07,607
- Would you have gone along with me?
- He was 30, Steve.

1223
01:43:07,732 --> 01:43:10,360
But l'd have considered it.

1224
01:43:10,443 --> 01:43:11,778
Thanks, Eleanor.

1225
01:43:12,279 --> 01:43:14,364
We're a dying breed.

1226
01:43:14,447 --> 01:43:17,075
Yeah.

1227
01:43:17,159 --> 01:43:19,786
l guess we were all right
while we lasted, though.

1228
01:43:19,870 --> 01:43:22,789
Oh, we were like glory's gate, my darling.

1229
01:43:22,873 --> 01:43:26,960
We were like that bloody shark of yours.
We swam with the, um, uh...

1230
01:43:27,043 --> 01:43:31,256
Oh, goddammit. l had it on the plane.
What was l gonna say?

1231
01:43:31,339 --> 01:43:34,926
- Ah, well, it's good to see you.
- How's your passport status?

1232
01:43:35,010 --> 01:43:38,388
Much better, thank you.
l'm back down to X-4.

1233
01:43:38,472 --> 01:43:41,725
Tell me,
who knocked up the reporter?

1234
01:43:43,518 --> 01:43:44,769
l don't know.

1235
01:43:51,860 --> 01:43:53,904
Thanks for showing me the first draft.

1236
01:43:54,029 --> 01:43:57,240
You read it. What did you think?

1237
01:43:57,324 --> 01:43:59,701
Well, l was a little embarrassed at first.

1238
01:43:59,784 --> 01:44:04,498
Obviously people are gonna think
l'm a showboat and a little bit of a prick,

1239
01:44:04,623 --> 01:44:07,459
but then l realised...

1240
01:44:07,542 --> 01:44:09,336
That's me.

1241
01:44:09,419 --> 01:44:12,380
l said those things, l did those things.

1242
01:44:13,381 --> 01:44:15,675
l can live with that.

1243
01:44:17,844 --> 01:44:20,055
You're a good writer, Jane.

1244
01:44:20,180 --> 01:44:22,307
lt's the effing cover.

1245
01:44:23,308 --> 01:44:25,185
Attagirl.

1246
01:44:26,228 --> 01:44:28,772
Excuse me.

1247
01:44:28,855 --> 01:44:33,652
Sorry to interrupt, but we got the scanning
monitor up. Looks like the jaguar shark,

1248
01:44:33,735 --> 01:44:38,615
or whatever it is that we're tracking,
is in a trench on the far side of the reef.

1249
01:44:42,452 --> 01:44:46,289
What the hell is going on
in here with the wiring?

1250
01:44:50,460 --> 01:44:52,754
Anybody feel like going for a ride?

1251
01:45:02,764 --> 01:45:07,018
Ned's Theme, take one.

1252
01:45:10,230 --> 01:45:14,985
l hooked a rhinestone bluefin
on a rope to give him something to eat.

1253
01:46:00,530 --> 01:46:05,660
ls that one of mine? l think
one of my research turtles survived.

1254
01:46:45,784 --> 01:46:48,078
Yeah, looks good.

1255
01:47:57,105 --> 01:48:00,942
- ls that him?
- That's him, Klaus.

1256
01:48:21,922 --> 01:48:24,132
Are we... Are we safe in here?

1257
01:48:25,175 --> 01:48:27,177
l doubt it.

1258
01:48:27,260 --> 01:48:30,013
You still want to blow him up?

1259
01:48:31,014 --> 01:48:34,351
No. We're out of dynamite, anyway.

1260
01:48:38,688 --> 01:48:41,441
lt is beautiful, Steve.

1261
01:48:42,275 --> 01:48:44,277
Yeah, it's pretty good, isn't it?

1262
01:48:47,989 --> 01:48:50,283
l wonder if it remembers me.

1263
01:49:16,434 --> 01:49:19,604
ln 1 2 years, he'll be 1 1 and a half.

1264
01:49:22,566 --> 01:49:24,860
That was my favourite age.

1265
01:49:38,999 --> 01:49:42,752
- Like this?
- Just like that.

1266
01:49:42,878 --> 01:49:45,172
You do it, too.

1267
01:49:46,298 --> 01:49:51,887
We complete the adventure,
but another of our crew has been lost.

1268
01:49:51,970 --> 01:49:53,847
This one was my son.

1269
01:49:54,723 --> 01:49:57,100
Also our equity partner.

1270
01:49:57,851 --> 01:50:01,605
We start the voyage home
in our wounded vessel.

1271
01:51:05,293 --> 01:51:06,795
Ho.

1272
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:08,171
Ho.

1273
01:51:21,810 --> 01:51:24,104
This is an adventure.
