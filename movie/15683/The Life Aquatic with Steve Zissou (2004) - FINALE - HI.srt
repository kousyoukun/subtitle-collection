00:20:40,092 --> 00:20:43,459
Ned, wanna come inside,
we'll make up a room for you?

309
00:20:43,562 --> 00:20:45,689
Steve, that reporter called.

- I'm on the echo box.</i>

313
00:21:05,518 --> 00:21:08,919
Push the red button to answer. Throw on your slop
and meet me on the beach in 12 minutes.

314
00:21:09,021 --> 00:21:10,989
The white button? Okay.

315
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:15,559
Action!

316
00:21:15,661 --> 00:21:20,428
Only twice before have I had
the good fortune to observe a rubber tide...

317
00:21:20,533 --> 00:21:23,024
that rare occurrence when hundreds
of electric jellyfish...

318
00:21:23,135 --> 00:21:26,036
spontaneously wash
onto a beachhead at once.

319
00:21:26,138 --> 00:21:30,666
Bobby Ogata brings exactly this
to our attention tonight.

320
00:21:33,946 --> 00:21:36,847
Steve, what produces
this effect of illumination?

321
00:21:36,949 --> 00:21:40,350
Is there a chemical
inside the organism?

322
00:21:40,453 --> 00:21:42,444
No, Ned.

323
00:21:42,555 --> 00:21:45,524
<i>Actually, it's the reflection of the moonlight
on their outer membranes.</i>

324
00:21:48,294 --> 00:21:51,422
That's a very good,
uh, ad-lib.

325
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:54,431
Klaus, come over here
and get a two-shot of me and Ned.

326
00:21:54,533 --> 00:21:56,524
Ned, come in here.

327
00:22:00,106 --> 00:22:02,939
Would you
like to join my crew?

328
00:22:03,042 --> 00:22:06,603
- Would I like to...
- I want you on Team Zissou.

329
00:22:06,712 --> 00:22:09,613
- I don't think I can do that.
- Why not?

330
00:22:09,715 --> 00:22:11,615
Well, it's not my field.

331
00:22:11,717 --> 00:22:14,618
- I don't have the background for it.
- No one here does.

332
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,620
Klaus used to be
a bus driver.

333
00:22:16,722 --> 00:22:19,316
Wolodarsky was a high school
substitute teacher.

Steve, I'm not even
that strong a swimmer.

336
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:29,233
The answer's yes.

337
00:22:29,335 --> 00:22:31,235
Well, it's got to be.

338
00:22:31,337 --> 00:22:33,897
I'll order you a red cap
and a Speedo. Cut.

339
00:22:34,006 --> 00:22:35,906
Klaus, why aren't you rolling?

340
00:22:36,008 --> 00:22:39,967
- Could I have a word with you, please?
- Why aren't you getting this?

341
00:22:41,647 --> 00:22:44,047
That was
a goddamn tearjerker.

342
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:48,052
- Why did you cut it, man?
- Because the sound is going to be shit.

343
00:22:48,154 --> 00:22:51,055
He doesn't even know how
to hold a boom.

344
00:22:51,157 --> 00:22:54,058
He doesn't know diddly-jack
about what we're doing.

345
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,526
Don't cut
unless I say "cut. "

346
00:22:56,629 --> 00:23:00,531
I've never seen
so many electric jellyfish in all my life!

347
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:02,624
Those are
Vietcong man-of-wars.

Oh, shit.
She's right.

349
00:23:13,979 --> 00:23:16,880
I guess we'll have to
loop that line.

We're producing a film,
as a matter of fact. Who are you?

I'm Jane Winslett-Richardson.

354

<i>- I'm the reporter from the Oceanographic Explorer.
- Oh, yeah, sure.</i>

355
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,497
<i>- How'd you get out here?
- I hired some drunk in a fishing boat.</i>

356
00:23:37,603 --> 00:23:41,232
That would take four hours.
Why would you do that?

357
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,241
Because no one picked me up
at the f-ing airport!

358
00:23:44,343 --> 00:23:46,243
Jesus Christ, Klaus.

359
00:23:46,345 --> 00:23:48,540
One of my guys
was supposed to do that.

360
00:23:48,647 --> 00:23:51,548
How long have you been working
with Zissou?

361
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:53,880
Uh, approximately...

362
00:23:53,986 --> 00:23:57,046
Only 10 minutes, actually.
I was hired during the scene on the beach.

363
00:23:57,156 --> 00:23:59,056
He's Steve's son, supposedly.

364
00:23:59,158 --> 00:24:01,991
You are? No, you're not.
He doesn't have one.

365
00:24:02,094 --> 00:24:05,757
Well, we're not 100% sure about that yet.
We just met yesterday.

366
00:24:08,033 --> 00:24:10,399
- Not this one, Klaus.
- Hmm?

367
00:24:15,074 --> 00:24:17,201
You heard me.
Not this one.

368
00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:19,209
Okay.

369
00:24:19,311 --> 00:24:21,711
- First thing in the morning, huh?
- Just print everything?

370
00:24:21,814 --> 00:24:24,874
<i>- Yeah. Tell 'em to push it a stop and a half.
- Okay.</i>

371
00:24:25,918 --> 00:24:28,318
What are you
gonna do with him?

372

<i>Who? Ned?</i>

373
00:24:31,423 --> 00:24:33,391
What do you mean?

374
00:24:35,027 --> 00:24:36,995
I don't understand
the question.

375
00:24:42,034 --> 00:24:45,197
<i>I offered him a spot
on the Belafonte.</i>

376

He didn't take it, did he?

377
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,040
Of course he took it.

378
00:24:50,142 --> 00:24:52,542
We're gonna put him
on the map, Eleanor.

379
00:24:52,645 --> 00:24:55,341
We're gonna throw him
a life preserver.

382
00:25:02,388 --> 00:25:04,481
Because
he looks up to me.

Yes, sir.

384
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:09,493
And McKinnon's willing to
take over my shuttle flights.

385

That's right.

386

Well, I just feel I need to
see this thing through, sir.
