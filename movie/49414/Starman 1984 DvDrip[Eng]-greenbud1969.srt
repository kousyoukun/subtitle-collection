1
00:00:08,516 --> 00:00:12,043
Minus ten, nine, eight, seven--

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,918
- Ignition.
- Main stage.

3
00:00:14,989 --> 00:00:17,184
Four, three...

4
00:00:17,258 --> 00:00:20,091
two, one, zero.

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,267
And so Voyager II
is now a part of history...

6
00:00:28,336 --> 00:00:31,772
rocketing into space from its launch pad
here at Cape Kennedy...

7
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,900
on this historic date,
August 20, 1977.

8
00:00:35,977 --> 00:00:39,140
On board the space probe
are photographic images of Earth...

9
00:00:39,213 --> 00:00:43,013
verbal greetings
and a medley of musical compositions.

10
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,052
Voyager II is our invitation...

11
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:47,679
to other intelligent species
in the universe:

12
00:00:47,755 --> 00:00:50,690
Please come and visit
our planet Earth.

13
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,628
As the Secretary General
of the United Nations...

14
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,363
an organization
of 147 member states...

15
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:07,033
who represent almost all of the human
inhabitants of the planet Earth...

16
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:10,373
I send greetings on behalf
of the people of our planet.

17
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:14,774
Hello from the children
of planet Earth.

18
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,262
When I want you
to hold me tight

19
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:45,737
Whenever I want you

20
00:02:45,807 --> 00:02:47,798
All I have to do

21
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:51,367
Is dream

22
00:02:52,647 --> 00:02:54,808
I can make you mine

23
00:02:54,882 --> 00:02:57,009
Taste your lips of wine

24
00:02:57,085 --> 00:03:00,612
Any time
Night or day

25
00:03:00,688 --> 00:03:03,555
Only trouble is

26
00:03:03,624 --> 00:03:07,560
I'm dreaming my life away

27
00:03:07,628 --> 00:03:09,892
I want you so

28
00:03:09,964 --> 00:03:11,932
That I could die

29
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:16,299
I love you so
And that is why

30
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,702
Whenever I want you

31
00:03:18,773 --> 00:03:20,741
All I have to do

32
00:03:20,808 --> 00:03:23,140
Is dream

33
00:03:23,211 --> 00:03:25,145
Dream, dream, dream

34
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:31,180
Big ending.

35
00:03:43,164 --> 00:03:46,099
How are you doing, sweetie?

36
00:03:57,145 --> 00:04:00,114
Don't do this to yourself, Jenny.
Go to sleep.

37
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:51,325
- That's very good, General.
- Mr.Director.

38
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,434
Would you excuse me, please?

39
00:05:06,414 --> 00:05:09,508
- Sounds like Soviet space garbage.
- The Molink people say no.

40
00:05:09,584 --> 00:05:13,179
- What does the Kremlin say?
- They don't know from nothing.

41
00:05:26,634 --> 00:05:29,899
This is Delta Yankee, two miles
and closing, locked on target.

42
00:05:29,971 --> 00:05:31,939
- Permission to launch.
- Permission granted.

43
00:05:32,006 --> 00:05:35,271
Delta Yankee executing launch.
Missiles away.

44
00:05:41,015 --> 00:05:42,949
Delta Yankee reports a hit, sir.

45
00:05:43,017 --> 00:05:45,884
No change in speed, but we've got
another alteration of course.

46
00:05:45,953 --> 00:05:49,548
New estimated point of impact:
Wisconsin, up by Chequamegon Bay.

47
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:53,993
Get Mark Shermin.

48
00:05:55,696 --> 00:05:58,221
Tony takes a pass, Murray
drives to the left and blows it!

49
00:05:58,299 --> 00:06:01,393
He's down.
No harm, no foul.

50
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:24,881
Call me back in 20 minutes,
will ya? I'm--

51
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,427
Yes, sir. Sorry about that.

52
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,933
What?

53
00:06:40,908 --> 00:06:43,376
Chequamegon Bay.
Yes, sir.

54
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,207
No problem.

55
00:10:14,421 --> 00:10:16,013
Goddamn.

56
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,719
Scott?

57
00:12:45,606 --> 00:12:47,836
You're not Scott.

58
00:12:51,378 --> 00:12:52,811
Scott.

59
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,277
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

60
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:30,113
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

61
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,812
As the Secretary General
of the United Nations...

62
00:13:32,886 --> 00:13:35,354
an organization
of 14 7 member states...

63
00:13:35,422 --> 00:13:39,483
who represent almost all of the human
inhabitants of the planet Earth...

64
00:13:41,095 --> 00:13:43,029
I send greetings.

65
00:14:28,442 --> 00:14:31,468
Who is that handsome guy?

66
00:14:31,545 --> 00:14:32,910
God, what a day.

67
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,413
Yeah.

68
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:55,866
Here she comes, ladies and gentlemen.
Look at this gorgeous car.

69
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,700
And off we go.

70
00:15:07,247 --> 00:15:11,274
Don't worry. It's not gonna go off
till the hammer's back.

71
00:15:11,351 --> 00:15:16,345
What we want to do
is we want to squeeze...

72
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:19,885
and squeeze.

73
00:15:22,596 --> 00:15:24,587
One more time.

74
00:15:26,099 --> 00:15:28,033
Not bad.

75
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:31,593
Actually, you should probably
steady with your other hand here.

76
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,373
More accuracy probably this way.

77
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,648
Yeah, come here.

78
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,150
Don't be afraid.

79
00:15:53,227 --> 00:15:54,660
I mean you no harm.

80
00:16:01,802 --> 00:16:04,464
This is great.

81
00:16:04,538 --> 00:16:05,971
Yeah.

82
00:17:38,732 --> 00:17:41,098
Oh, boy,
what a weird dream.

83
00:19:34,114 --> 00:19:35,979
Who are you?

84
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,210
What do you want?

85
00:19:43,523 --> 00:19:45,889
We go.

86
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,560
I can't get the engine started.

87
00:20:29,703 --> 00:20:31,967
Where?

88
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:33,972
Which way? Left? Right?

89
00:20:54,828 --> 00:20:56,261
Here.

90
00:20:57,764 --> 00:21:00,255
You know where that place is?

91
00:21:05,438 --> 00:21:07,998
If this is California...

92
00:21:08,074 --> 00:21:10,304
and down here's Texas...

93
00:21:10,377 --> 00:21:13,175
that must be, like...

94
00:21:14,347 --> 00:21:15,507
Arizona, maybe?

95
00:21:15,582 --> 00:21:19,882
Want to be driven.
Arizona, maybe.

96
00:21:46,379 --> 00:21:48,313
Ten minutes.

97
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,089
- About that time, Mr.Shermin.
- Oh, okay.

98
00:22:01,161 --> 00:22:03,322
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

99
00:22:08,068 --> 00:22:11,435
Sergeant, can you get
police bands on that thing?

100
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:14,029
No problem. Why?

101
00:22:14,107 --> 00:22:16,575
I'm interested
in anything weird.

102
00:22:16,643 --> 00:22:19,203
You know, freaky, bizarre.

103
00:23:09,195 --> 00:23:11,686
Hi there. I'm Major Bell.

104
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,733
Hi. Mark Shermin.

105
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,234
- Is it clean?
- No radioactivity.

106
00:23:16,303 --> 00:23:18,396
No readings on bacteria.

107
00:23:18,471 --> 00:23:20,735
Are you attached
to National Security?

108
00:23:20,807 --> 00:23:23,401
Not very.
I just work for them.

109
00:23:23,476 --> 00:23:26,809
On loan,
sort of like a library book.

110
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,849
Actually, I'm with SETI, Search
for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

111
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:32,282
So they're sending you guys out
on meteorites now, huh?

112
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:35,913
- Only when they change course.
- Change course? Can they do that?

113
00:23:35,989 --> 00:23:39,447
This one did, so they tell me.
Twice.

114
00:23:39,526 --> 00:23:42,154
Either that
or some airhead over at NORAD...

115
00:23:42,228 --> 00:23:44,856
misread a glitch on his monitor.

116
00:23:44,931 --> 00:23:47,422
It also came down slower
than suborbital speed...

117
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,094
so naturally they decided
to fire some missiles at it.

118
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,602
What are they doing?

119
00:23:54,674 --> 00:23:57,370
- Trying to take a core sample.
- Nobody authorized that.

120
00:23:57,444 --> 00:24:00,880
- It sounded hollow to me.
- There's no such thing as a hollow--

121
00:24:05,952 --> 00:24:10,389
- Jesus Christ!
- You were about to say?

122
00:24:10,457 --> 00:24:11,651
Up and at 'em.

123
00:24:11,725 --> 00:24:14,159
This is station WDLU
in Madison, Wisconsin...

124
00:24:14,227 --> 00:24:16,161
bringing you the 6:00 a.m. news.

125
00:24:16,229 --> 00:24:19,027
No, folks, all of you that saw
that flash in the sky last night...

126
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:22,296
it wasn't the end of the world
and it wasn't a burning airliner.

127
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:24,360
No, sir. According
to the A.P. wire...

128
00:24:24,437 --> 00:24:28,430
one of the biggest meteorites to strike
the planet Earth in 80 years...

129
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:32,239
hit last night near Ashland,
not far from Chequamegon Bay.

130
00:24:32,312 --> 00:24:35,975
So you folks who called in to say
you saw a flying saucer land--

131
00:24:40,487 --> 00:24:42,182
That's about you?

132
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:48,259
You really are some kind
of Martian or something, aren't you?

133
00:24:50,897 --> 00:24:52,831
What do you want here?

134
00:24:52,899 --> 00:24:55,493
What are you doing?

135
00:24:55,568 --> 00:24:57,399
What do you want with me?

136
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,028
Where are you taking me?

137
00:24:59,105 --> 00:25:01,699
Why do you look
so much like Scott?

138
00:25:03,309 --> 00:25:05,243
I can't get no

139
00:25:06,246 --> 00:25:08,510
Satisfaction

140
00:25:08,581 --> 00:25:10,071
That does it.

141
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:23,962
Help!

142
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:28,364
Crazy sons of bitches!
What's the matter with you?

143
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:33,533
Help me, please!

144
00:25:33,606 --> 00:25:36,939
- I'm being kidnapped!
- I send greetings.

145
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,773
What's going on here?

146
00:25:38,845 --> 00:25:41,712
I'm being kidnapped!

147
00:25:41,781 --> 00:25:42,873
Greetings.

148
00:25:44,284 --> 00:25:46,582
You better let her go, pal.
I'll give you some greetings.

149
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:27,351
How'd you do that?

150
00:26:27,427 --> 00:26:29,418
Those little gray jobs?

151
00:27:12,105 --> 00:27:15,404
Communications Central, this is
Project Visitor, Chequamegon sighting.

152
00:27:15,475 --> 00:27:18,273
I have Mr.Shermin for you.

153
00:27:18,344 --> 00:27:20,471
The director's on the line.

154
00:27:22,448 --> 00:27:23,813
Shermin, what is it?

155
00:27:23,883 --> 00:27:25,373
I'll know more in a few hours.

156
00:27:25,451 --> 00:27:28,079
We're taking it out of here now,
and I'm setting up a lab in Madison.

157
00:27:28,154 --> 00:27:32,113
This meteor, the Chequamegon sighting,
appears to be hollow?

158
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:35,719
No, not appears to be.
It is hollow.

159
00:27:37,297 --> 00:27:40,755
I think the balloon
has just gone up, sir.

160
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,375
Do you have to keep that thing
on your lap like that?

161
00:27:57,483 --> 00:28:00,919
Those things-- guns--
make me a little bit jumpy.

162
00:28:00,987 --> 00:28:03,956
Define "little bit jumpy."

163
00:28:05,258 --> 00:28:07,522
That's a little bit.

164
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:12,459
Jumpy's like nervous, afraid.

165
00:28:12,532 --> 00:28:14,659
You know that word, "afraid"?

166
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,702
Afraid. Yes.

167
00:28:18,204 --> 00:28:20,399
How much English
do you understand?

168
00:28:20,473 --> 00:28:24,307
I understand greetings
in 54 planet Earth languages.

169
00:28:25,311 --> 00:28:27,836
I understand...

170
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:30,382
English language little bit.

171
00:28:35,955 --> 00:28:39,254
Nothing much in there.
It's just a lot of junk.

172
00:28:39,325 --> 00:28:41,384
That's my wallet.

173
00:28:49,502 --> 00:28:51,936
That's my driver's license.

174
00:28:56,209 --> 00:28:59,940
That's me.
My name, Jenny Hayden.

175
00:29:00,013 --> 00:29:01,947
Jenny Hayden.

176
00:29:03,983 --> 00:29:07,282
What do you want, anyway?
Why did you come here?

177
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,687
Oh, my God.

178
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,887
I look like Scott.

179
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,534
Yeah, you do.

180
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:28,871
I look like Scott...

181
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:32,274
so you do not be
little bit jumpy.

182
00:30:23,963 --> 00:30:27,524
Listen, about those police calls,
you did say "anything weird," right?

183
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,965
You got something?

184
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,833
Just picked up one from Ashland,
happened sometime this morning.

185
00:30:31,904 --> 00:30:36,204
A guy named Heinmuller had a collision
with an orange and black '77 Mustang.

186
00:30:36,275 --> 00:30:38,766
The gal who was driving
claimed she was being kidnapped...

187
00:30:38,845 --> 00:30:42,747
but when Heinmuller went to help her,
the guy she was with, the kidnapper...

188
00:30:42,815 --> 00:30:45,409
yelled "Greetings"
and melted his lug wrench.

189
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,377
Yelled "Greetings"
and melted his lug wrench?

190
00:30:48,454 --> 00:30:50,217
Weird you want, weird you get.

191
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:52,086
How do you melt a lug wrench?

192
00:30:52,158 --> 00:30:54,490
I just copy them down.
I don't explain them.

193
00:30:55,628 --> 00:30:58,392
- Did anybody get a license number?
- Yeah, Wisconsin plates.

194
00:30:58,464 --> 00:31:00,432
Papa-X-Ray-Victor-237.

195
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,331
We're checking the owner
through D.M.V. now.

196
00:31:28,995 --> 00:31:31,862
What the hell is that thing?

197
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,559
A sort of an invitation, Major.

198
00:31:34,634 --> 00:31:37,899
You remember that package we sent up
with the Voyager probe?

199
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:40,370
There was a gold, anodized disk...

200
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,466
with greetings from Earth
in 54 different languages...

201
00:31:43,543 --> 00:31:46,740
complete with a nice, little speech
from Kurt Waldheim:

202
00:31:46,813 --> 00:31:49,782
"To whom it may concern.

203
00:31:49,849 --> 00:31:52,113
Come and see us sometime."

204
00:31:55,688 --> 00:31:57,349
We're coming to a gas station.

205
00:31:57,423 --> 00:31:59,687
We're gonna need some gas, okay?

206
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:01,420
Gas.

207
00:32:01,494 --> 00:32:04,952
Gas for the car.

208
00:32:05,031 --> 00:32:07,522
Fuel. Energy.

209
00:32:09,101 --> 00:32:12,696
I step on the gas, the car goes.
I take my foot off, the car stops.

210
00:32:12,772 --> 00:32:15,036
- Understand?
- No.

211
00:32:15,107 --> 00:32:17,302
I do not understand.

212
00:32:18,878 --> 00:32:21,244
How can car need energy so soon?

213
00:32:22,248 --> 00:32:25,217
I don't know. I'm just telling you
this is the gas gauge.

214
00:32:25,284 --> 00:32:28,014
When that needle gets to "E,"
that's empty. No gas.

215
00:32:28,087 --> 00:32:31,750
- The car stops, period.
- Okay.

216
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:33,758
Get gas.

217
00:32:51,978 --> 00:32:54,344
- Here you go.
- Take it easy.

218
00:32:55,581 --> 00:32:57,515
Take it easy.

219
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:05,119
- Fill her up, unleaded.
- Gas.

220
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:07,784
Gotcha.

221
00:33:20,506 --> 00:33:22,701
Yeah, I know.

222
00:33:22,775 --> 00:33:25,039
I have to go to the bathroom.

223
00:33:25,111 --> 00:33:27,705
The ladies' room.
The rest room.

224
00:33:30,016 --> 00:33:32,450
It's when a person has to--

225
00:33:35,321 --> 00:33:38,119
The hell with it.
Figure it out yourself. I'm going.

226
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,925
"Women." Me.

227
00:34:23,069 --> 00:34:25,264
"Men." You.

228
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:27,772
Understand?

229
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,750
You can't get her out, huh?

230
00:34:43,823 --> 00:34:45,415
Gas.

231
00:34:45,491 --> 00:34:48,119
Well, I know just how she feels.

232
00:35:09,682 --> 00:35:12,480
Every goddamn place you go.

233
00:35:16,222 --> 00:35:18,156
Take it easy.

234
00:35:20,126 --> 00:35:22,060
Up yours.

235
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,254
Let's go.

236
00:35:54,827 --> 00:35:57,022
Nothing of interest in here.

237
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:28,959
You want to sign that for me,
Miss Hayden?

238
00:36:58,224 --> 00:36:59,987
Kidnapped.

239
00:37:02,128 --> 00:37:03,220
What?

240
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,634
What is...

241
00:37:11,403 --> 00:37:12,836
kidnapped?

242
00:37:24,917 --> 00:37:27,477
You want to know
what kidnapped is?

243
00:37:27,553 --> 00:37:31,785
It's being dragged out of your house
in the middle of the night...

244
00:37:31,857 --> 00:37:33,984
by some-- whatever you are...

245
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:37,586
being forced to drive all night
with a gun pointed in your side...

246
00:37:37,663 --> 00:37:40,962
not knowing where you're going or what's
gonna happen to you when you get there.

247
00:37:42,067 --> 00:37:45,298
If you're gonna shoot me,
go ahead...

248
00:37:47,273 --> 00:37:51,175
'cause I'd rather be shot
than go on being scared to death.

249
00:37:56,448 --> 00:37:57,881
Go ahead.

250
00:38:12,198 --> 00:38:16,362
I mean you no harm,
Jenny Hayden.

251
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:32,014
New music plays.
Here's Ole Blue Eyes, Francis Albert.

252
00:38:52,104 --> 00:38:56,302
Start spreadin' the news

253
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:59,276
I'm leavin' today

254
00:39:00,312 --> 00:39:04,874
I want to be a part of it

255
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:08,386
New York, New York

256
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:12,557
I'm sorry.

257
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:15,116
I did awaken you.

258
00:39:22,001 --> 00:39:25,334
Do they sing a lot
where you live?

259
00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:30,035
Yes, we sing.

260
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:34,011
Do you ever get hungry?

261
00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:39,283
Empty here.

262
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:43,146
Like a car needs gas.

263
00:39:43,222 --> 00:39:44,655
Yes.

264
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,590
This body
has a terrible emptiness.

265
00:39:50,663 --> 00:39:52,255
This is called hungry?

266
00:39:52,331 --> 00:39:56,062
Yeah, and when people get hungry,
they have to eat food.

267
00:39:57,136 --> 00:39:59,627
Eat. Yes, we must do that.

268
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,974
We will stop at food station.

269
00:40:03,042 --> 00:40:05,738
You have hungry too?

270
00:40:05,811 --> 00:40:08,177
I'm starving.

271
00:40:08,247 --> 00:40:11,114
I haven't eaten since--

272
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:14,611
Oh, my God!

273
00:40:16,322 --> 00:40:18,153
Look out!
What are you doing?

274
00:40:26,565 --> 00:40:28,192
Okay?

275
00:40:28,267 --> 00:40:32,135
Okay? Are you crazy?
You almost got us killed.

276
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,570
You said you watched me.
You said you knew the rules.

277
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,075
I do know the rules.

278
00:40:38,143 --> 00:40:41,806
For your information, pal,
that was a yellow light back there.

279
00:40:43,916 --> 00:40:46,180
I watched you very carefully.

280
00:40:47,586 --> 00:40:50,282
Red light stop,
green light go...

281
00:40:50,356 --> 00:40:52,950
yellow light go very fast.

282
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,690
- You better let me drive.
- I will drive.

283
00:40:59,898 --> 00:41:03,664
Do you seriously expect me
to tell the president...

284
00:41:03,736 --> 00:41:06,432
that an alien has landed...

285
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:09,872
assumed the identity
of a dead house painter...

286
00:41:09,942 --> 00:41:11,432
from Madison, Wisconsin...

287
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,809
and is presently out
tooling around the countryside...

288
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,075
in a hopped-up,
orange and black...

289
00:41:17,149 --> 00:41:19,140
1977 Mustang?

290
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:23,345
We have the following givens.
Look.

291
00:41:23,422 --> 00:41:26,152
That man, Scott Hayden,
died last April.

292
00:41:26,225 --> 00:41:28,125
He's dead and buried.
That's verified.

293
00:41:28,193 --> 00:41:30,457
He has no brothers,
no look-alike cousins.

294
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:33,054
But still this morning
at approximately 6:00--

295
00:41:33,132 --> 00:41:36,397
All right, we have
been through all of that.

296
00:41:36,468 --> 00:41:39,335
I'm gonna ask you now,
how could it happen?

297
00:41:39,405 --> 00:41:41,999
We think it might be
some kind of a cloning deal...

298
00:41:42,074 --> 00:41:44,975
replication of an entire organism
from a single cell.

299
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:48,707
- We found some of Scott Hayden's hair.
- Is that possible?

300
00:41:48,781 --> 00:41:52,217
Can you clone a living organism
from the hair of a dead man?

301
00:41:52,284 --> 00:41:55,117
Well, human hair consists
of keratinized cells...

302
00:41:55,187 --> 00:41:58,281
although in order to determine
whether replication is possible--

303
00:41:58,357 --> 00:42:00,621
I asked you a question.

304
00:42:00,692 --> 00:42:03,456
You mean us, in our
present state of technology?

305
00:42:03,529 --> 00:42:05,463
- Yes.
- No.

306
00:42:05,531 --> 00:42:07,829
What the hell
are we talking about?

307
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:12,530
We're hypothesizing a technology
that's 100,000 years ahead of us.

308
00:42:12,604 --> 00:42:15,801
We're the ancients, Mr.Fox.

309
00:42:15,874 --> 00:42:16,932
Ancients?

310
00:42:17,009 --> 00:42:20,137
Technologically, yes.
We've just started.

311
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,114
But even if you're right,
I still have problems.

312
00:42:24,183 --> 00:42:25,582
His knowledge of English.

313
00:42:26,819 --> 00:42:28,684
Listen to this.

314
00:42:30,789 --> 00:42:33,019
I helped put this package
together, you know.

315
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:35,720
This was designed so that
an intelligent species...

316
00:42:35,794 --> 00:42:38,160
could get a working knowledge
of English...

317
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:40,164
enough to get by, anyhow.

318
00:42:40,232 --> 00:42:42,723
A couple hundred word vocabulary,
a rough idea of syntax.

319
00:42:42,801 --> 00:42:46,931
Think of what it would mean to talk to
a being from a civilization like that.

320
00:42:47,005 --> 00:42:48,939
Think of what we could learn.

321
00:42:50,509 --> 00:42:53,808
Who represent almost all
of the human inhabitants...

322
00:42:53,879 --> 00:42:56,871
of the planet Earth,
I send greetings.

323
00:42:56,949 --> 00:43:00,248
Greetings! There. That's what
he said to Heinmuller on the road.

324
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,651
It is also what the cannibal
said to the missionary...

325
00:43:02,721 --> 00:43:04,985
just before he ate him.

326
00:43:05,057 --> 00:43:07,582
The question in this case is...

327
00:43:07,659 --> 00:43:10,628
who is the missionary
and who are the cannibals?

328
00:43:13,298 --> 00:43:15,789
When do you have to be there?

329
00:43:15,868 --> 00:43:17,301
What?

330
00:43:18,737 --> 00:43:21,797
In Arizona.
When do you have to be there?

331
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:26,903
Do you see this little star?

332
00:43:29,014 --> 00:43:32,108
Star? What star? Where?

333
00:43:34,386 --> 00:43:35,478
There.

334
00:43:37,856 --> 00:43:40,450
We call that the sun.

335
00:43:40,526 --> 00:43:42,460
When this little--

336
00:43:43,896 --> 00:43:45,830
When the sun...

337
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,694
appears mid-sky three more times...

338
00:43:48,767 --> 00:43:51,668
I must be at Arizona.

339
00:43:51,737 --> 00:43:55,833
You mean 12:00 noon
three days from now?

340
00:43:55,908 --> 00:43:57,273
Yes.

341
00:43:57,342 --> 00:44:00,903
And what happens if you
don't get there in time?

342
00:44:02,281 --> 00:44:04,511
Then they will go.

343
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:06,744
- Without you?
- Yes.

344
00:44:08,253 --> 00:44:09,345
What will you do then?

345
00:44:09,421 --> 00:44:12,322
Then I will die.

346
00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:14,558
Die?

347
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:22,966
Understand?

348
00:44:29,241 --> 00:44:31,436
You look for food station.

349
00:45:07,312 --> 00:45:08,745
What?

350
00:45:11,149 --> 00:45:13,709
A deer.

351
00:45:13,785 --> 00:45:15,719
A dead deer.

352
00:45:16,855 --> 00:45:19,380
Dead deer. Why?

353
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:22,950
People hunt them
to eat for food.

354
00:45:25,364 --> 00:45:27,298
Do deer eat people?

355
00:45:29,167 --> 00:45:31,965
Do people eat people?

356
00:45:32,037 --> 00:45:34,335
No, of course not.
What do you think we are?

357
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:39,638
I think you are
a very primitive species.

358
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,840
What are you, softhearted?

359
00:45:44,916 --> 00:45:46,907
You cry when you saw Bambi?

360
00:45:46,985 --> 00:45:49,044
- Define Bambi.
- Huh?

361
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:52,557
He doesn't understand.
He's not from around here.

362
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:55,320
You don't speak any English, huh?

363
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:59,857
Steer clear of that bozo.

364
00:46:01,033 --> 00:46:04,594
- Define bozo.
- Jerk.

365
00:46:07,706 --> 00:46:10,038
From Denver here...

366
00:46:14,112 --> 00:46:18,105
it's south on Interstate 25.

367
00:46:18,183 --> 00:46:21,152
Then you pick up I-40
westbound at Albuquerque.

368
00:46:21,219 --> 00:46:24,279
Forget that deer for a second.
I'm trying to show you something.

369
00:46:24,356 --> 00:46:27,120
Now, where exactly in Arizona...

370
00:46:27,192 --> 00:46:29,683
are you supposed to
meet your friends?

371
00:46:33,098 --> 00:46:34,531
Here.

372
00:46:35,801 --> 00:46:37,598
West of Winslow.

373
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:40,035
I see a little speck
on the map, but there's...

374
00:46:41,606 --> 00:46:43,335
a crater?

375
00:46:43,408 --> 00:46:45,899
You're supposed to meet them
where that meteor hit?

376
00:46:46,945 --> 00:46:48,435
Why do you do this?

377
00:46:50,782 --> 00:46:53,876
Better safe than sorry.
In case something happens to me.

378
00:46:53,952 --> 00:46:56,147
There's one more thing.

379
00:46:56,221 --> 00:46:58,451
The credit card for the gas.

380
00:46:58,523 --> 00:47:00,957
- You know how that worked.
- Why should something happen to you?

381
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:09,227
Who knows?

382
00:47:09,301 --> 00:47:13,533
The way you drive, traveling with you
could be detrimental to the health.

383
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:23,541
That's...

384
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:28,783
me and Scott on our honeymoon.

385
00:47:30,255 --> 00:47:32,587
A honeymoon is...

386
00:47:34,259 --> 00:47:36,591
what you call it when...

387
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:40,930
two people first get married,
and they...

388
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:44,566
go off together
after they've fallen in love.

389
00:47:45,937 --> 00:47:47,234
Define love.

390
00:47:52,377 --> 00:47:54,311
Love is--

391
00:47:58,483 --> 00:48:00,610
It's when you care...

392
00:48:03,021 --> 00:48:06,218
more for someone else
than you do for yourself.

393
00:48:07,626 --> 00:48:10,424
But it's not just that.

394
00:48:12,297 --> 00:48:14,231
It's when someone is...

395
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:17,029
a part of you.

396
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:20,597
And when they--

397
00:48:24,476 --> 00:48:26,410
What?

398
00:48:29,047 --> 00:48:31,481
Scott is dead.

399
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:33,643
He was killed in an accident.

400
00:48:37,355 --> 00:48:39,721
When someone you love...

401
00:48:41,593 --> 00:48:43,026
dies--

402
00:48:44,629 --> 00:48:47,154
Oh, shit.

403
00:48:52,204 --> 00:48:54,172
Define shit.

404
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,867
Don't say that.
That's not a nice word.

405
00:49:03,882 --> 00:49:07,113
Don't mind him.
He's just learning to speak English.

406
00:49:07,185 --> 00:49:09,745
He's got a hell of a start on it.

407
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:12,346
Who's the deviled egg
on white toast?

408
00:49:12,424 --> 00:49:15,188
- He is.
- Right.

409
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:17,421
And a Super Burger...

410
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,430
two orders of fries...

411
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,432
two choc malts...

412
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,968
and two Dutch apple pie
with whipped cream.

413
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:27,204
Had a wedge of it myself.

414
00:49:27,272 --> 00:49:30,105
It's terrific. Enjoy.

415
00:49:32,911 --> 00:49:34,845
Well, dig in.

416
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:38,873
Wait, no.

417
00:49:40,218 --> 00:49:42,243
That's your dessert.

418
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,254
Eat that with a fork.

419
00:49:45,423 --> 00:49:47,550
This thing.

420
00:49:47,626 --> 00:49:49,491
Here, like this.

421
00:49:53,732 --> 00:49:56,098
But you eat that last.

422
00:49:56,167 --> 00:49:58,635
Sandwich first, dessert last.

423
00:49:59,771 --> 00:50:01,204
Why?

424
00:50:02,474 --> 00:50:05,807
I don't know.
That's just how it's done.

425
00:50:13,718 --> 00:50:15,652
What's the matter?

426
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,490
Dutch apple pie.

427
00:50:20,492 --> 00:50:21,754
Good.

428
00:50:23,762 --> 00:50:25,491
It's terrific.

429
00:50:30,969 --> 00:50:33,267
For a primitive species,
we have our points.

430
00:50:33,338 --> 00:50:35,772
Anybody for Lincoln,
Omaha or Chicago...

431
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,434
the bus leaves in five minutes.

432
00:50:45,951 --> 00:50:47,350
Look...

433
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:51,014
I got to go to the--

434
00:50:54,526 --> 00:50:56,153
I'll be right back.

435
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:10,400
Excuse me.

436
00:51:10,475 --> 00:51:13,876
- Is there a back way out of here?
- Sure. Through the kitchen.

437
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:15,378
Why?

438
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:20,479
- That fellow I came in with?
- Yeah?

439
00:51:20,552 --> 00:51:23,953
Could you give these things
to him after the bus leaves?

440
00:51:24,022 --> 00:51:27,583
It's just a map,
car keys and a credit card.

441
00:51:27,659 --> 00:51:30,651
- You sure, honey?
- Yeah, I'm positive.

442
00:51:30,729 --> 00:51:32,162
Thanks.

443
00:51:34,366 --> 00:51:36,493
Hey, honey.

444
00:51:36,568 --> 00:51:38,763
I wouldn't go out
through the back door right now.

445
00:51:38,837 --> 00:51:41,499
That friend of yours
is out there in the parking lot.

446
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,076
Thanks.

447
00:52:50,775 --> 00:52:53,938
Excuse me, miss.
You strike me as a meat eater.

448
00:52:54,012 --> 00:52:56,572
I can fix you up
with a nice haunch of venison...

449
00:52:56,648 --> 00:52:59,310
maybe even a shot of pork
if you could--

450
00:53:01,453 --> 00:53:03,045
That son of a bitch.

451
00:53:08,927 --> 00:53:11,828
Hey, what happened
to the goddamn deer?

452
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:15,791
She went there, to the woods.

453
00:53:15,867 --> 00:53:17,494
Okay, comedian.

454
00:53:19,637 --> 00:53:21,070
Bingo.

455
00:53:22,507 --> 00:53:24,236
You leave him alone.

456
00:53:24,309 --> 00:53:26,243
- Butt out, girlie.
- He doesn't understand.

457
00:53:26,311 --> 00:53:28,211
He doesn't speak English.

458
00:53:28,279 --> 00:53:30,509
- So what?
- Hey.

459
00:53:33,118 --> 00:53:34,551
Bingo.

460
00:54:00,044 --> 00:54:01,978
I'm gonna tear you loose
from your hinges, boy.

461
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,645
Pick up your garbage
and get going.

462
00:54:20,765 --> 00:54:23,666
Oh, Jesus. Are you okay?

463
00:54:23,735 --> 00:54:25,669
I thought...

464
00:54:25,737 --> 00:54:28,228
guns make you little bit jumpy,
Jenny Hayden.

465
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:31,002
You make me a little bit jumpy.

466
00:54:32,544 --> 00:54:35,342
I thought I told you
to stay away from those bozos.

467
00:54:38,983 --> 00:54:41,850
It's okay.
I think I understand.

468
00:54:55,266 --> 00:54:57,496
It looks better that way.

469
00:54:57,569 --> 00:54:59,696
Thank you, Jenny Hayden.

470
00:55:04,576 --> 00:55:07,204
All part of our friendly service.

471
00:55:11,015 --> 00:55:13,381
- Are you okay, honey?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

472
00:55:13,451 --> 00:55:16,716
I wanted to tell you
that eastbound bus is about to go.

473
00:55:16,788 --> 00:55:18,050
Want me to hold it?

474
00:55:24,295 --> 00:55:27,287
No, thank you. Never mind.

475
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:29,299
Thanks, but never mind.

476
00:55:30,468 --> 00:55:32,402
Good luck.

477
00:55:45,416 --> 00:55:48,579
I'm gonna get that bastard,
Donnie Bob, right now.

478
00:55:57,161 --> 00:55:58,321
Look out!

479
00:56:01,332 --> 00:56:02,424
Take it easy!

480
00:56:05,136 --> 00:56:07,001
I'm gonna get
that son of a bitch.

481
00:56:31,195 --> 00:56:33,356
It's their fault,
the Mustang.

482
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:36,366
- Son of a bitch hit me and took off.
- Anybody get his number?

483
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:41,462
No, but it shouldn't be hard to pick up.
'77 Mustang with Wisconsin plates on it.

484
00:56:50,348 --> 00:56:52,509
That Mustang them state boys wanted?

485
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:55,279
That was orange and black '77
with Wisconsin plates?

486
00:56:55,353 --> 00:56:57,344
Kick her in the ass.
I think we got the bastard.

487
00:57:07,098 --> 00:57:10,363
Damn it, Sergeant. We've been here since
6:30 this afternoon. When can we leave?

488
00:57:10,435 --> 00:57:15,168
As soon as the federals say so
and not one damn minute before.

489
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:28,016
Everybody tells it
pretty much the same way.

490
00:57:28,086 --> 00:57:30,179
She had every chance in the world
to get away from him...

491
00:57:30,254 --> 00:57:32,449
but they left together
with her driving.

492
00:57:32,523 --> 00:57:35,048
Does that sound like any kind of
kidnapping you ever heard of?

493
00:57:35,126 --> 00:57:39,392
They spotted an orange and black
Mustang, Wisconsin plates.

494
00:57:39,464 --> 00:57:42,194
- Going west near Big Springs.
- Right.

495
00:57:45,269 --> 00:57:50,002
Scott and I met two winters ago
up at Iron Mountain ice-skating.

496
00:57:51,209 --> 00:57:55,373
I had on this little
tight skating outfit.

497
00:57:56,614 --> 00:58:01,142
I was showing off.
He kept staring at me.

498
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:07,583
One thing led to another. A few months
later we were on our honeymoon.

499
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:10,923
Honeymoon is nice?

500
00:58:10,995 --> 00:58:14,453
Oh, yeah, ours was beautiful.

501
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,267
Define beautiful.

502
00:58:18,336 --> 00:58:20,361
Beautiful is...

503
00:58:21,439 --> 00:58:23,805
better than terrific...

504
00:58:24,842 --> 00:58:27,572
better than Dutch apple pie.

505
00:58:29,347 --> 00:58:31,281
The best.

506
00:58:54,305 --> 00:58:57,763
Gotta get a couple of hours sleep.
Just a couple, okay?

507
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:31,204
You're not to approach them. Keep them
under surveillance till the feds arrive.

508
00:59:31,275 --> 00:59:33,243
What if they approach us?

509
00:59:33,311 --> 00:59:36,246
If you're in a life-threatening
situation, defend yourselves.

510
00:59:36,314 --> 00:59:39,044
Otherwise, wait for the feds.

511
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:44,384
They get the 6:00 news,
and we get the shit end of the stick.

512
00:59:44,455 --> 00:59:49,188
- That's the way it is.
- It doesn't have to be that way.

513
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:54,527
I got a hunch this might develop
into a life-threatening situation.

514
00:59:54,599 --> 00:59:59,969
We'd like a room for the night
as far away from this as possible.

515
01:00:02,073 --> 01:00:04,735
Oh, boy, am I whipped.

516
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:09,177
My mom always said there wasn't
a thing wrong with the world...

517
01:00:09,247 --> 01:00:13,047
that a hot bath and
a good night's sleep couldn't fix.

518
01:00:18,122 --> 01:00:21,319
What am I doing?
I must be getting punchy.

519
01:00:21,392 --> 01:00:25,852
It's just that in that light you look
so much like Scott. I wasn't thinking.

520
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:29,798
- You said, "Your nose is different."
- What?

521
01:00:29,867 --> 01:00:32,427
You said, "Your nose is different.

522
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:34,869
He broke his twice,
and there's something else.

523
01:00:34,939 --> 01:00:37,407
I don't know.
Something spooky about your eyes."

524
01:00:37,475 --> 01:00:39,841
That's word for word.

525
01:00:39,911 --> 01:00:42,345
You remember everything you hear
word for word?

526
01:00:42,413 --> 01:00:45,974
Everything I hear, everything I see.
Everything I--

527
01:00:48,152 --> 01:00:50,882
Everything this body feels.

528
01:00:57,728 --> 01:00:59,355
The tub.

529
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:03,025
Thirty points apiece is what the
questions are worth. Tell us about it.

530
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,431
Final category is songwriters.

531
01:01:09,941 --> 01:01:14,435
Believe me, General. I know what
went wrong. The x factor wasn't red.

532
01:02:00,691 --> 01:02:03,489
I never knew
it could be like this.

533
01:02:03,561 --> 01:02:05,825
Nobody ever kissed me
the way you do.

534
01:02:06,631 --> 01:02:10,658
- Nobody?
- No. Nobody.

535
01:02:10,735 --> 01:02:13,863
Not even one? Out of all the men
you've been kissed by?

536
01:02:15,539 --> 01:02:19,600
Well, that'll take some figuring.
How many men do you think there've been?

537
01:02:19,677 --> 01:02:21,770
I wouldn't know.
Can't you give me a rough estimate?

538
01:02:21,846 --> 01:02:25,782
Not without an adding machine. Do you
have your adding machine with you?

539
01:02:25,850 --> 01:02:27,841
I forgot to bring it.

540
01:02:27,918 --> 01:02:30,409
Then I guess you won't
find out, will you?

541
01:02:31,455 --> 01:02:34,947
Hey, there, buddy!
Are you in there?

542
01:02:38,329 --> 01:02:42,231
It's none of my business,
but if that's your orange Mustang...

543
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,632
there's a couple of cops
trying to jiggle the lock.

544
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:08,682
The bastards ran one on us!

545
01:03:17,301 --> 01:03:19,064
Papa-Charlie-Three!

546
01:03:19,136 --> 01:03:22,162
Suspects in orange Mustang
are headed south on Big Spring bypass.

547
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:23,831
We are in pursuit!

548
01:03:41,525 --> 01:03:43,618
He's got a gun.

549
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:13,652
Papa-Charlie-Three!
Suspects on I-80 proceeding northbound.

550
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:16,090
Still in pursuit.

551
01:05:38,542 --> 01:05:41,409
I know it sounds impossible, but
I have a couple of people that say...

552
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:44,414
they saw him carrying her
out of the burning wreckage.

553
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,416
Then they just disappeared
in the smoke.

554
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:50,443
I've had the police check the
entire area, and there are no bodies.

555
01:05:50,521 --> 01:05:51,920
Thanks.

556
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:55,516
Anyway, I can only assume they're still
alive, and they're probably headed west.

557
01:05:55,593 --> 01:05:57,754
I'm going down to
Grand Junction, Colorado.

558
01:05:57,828 --> 01:06:01,821
The army is setting up some kind
of a roadblock on I-70. I'm goin'.

559
01:06:01,899 --> 01:06:03,389
Move it out.

560
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:18,354
You're wanted on the horn.
Urgent.

561
01:10:24,228 --> 01:10:27,061
Hello? Oh,
I've probably been cut off.

562
01:10:27,131 --> 01:10:30,726
Hello? Yeah,
I was talking to the police.

563
01:10:30,801 --> 01:10:32,735
I'm not the police, Mrs.Hayden.

564
01:10:32,803 --> 01:10:34,828
My name is Mark Shermin.
I'm with National Security.

565
01:10:34,905 --> 01:10:37,533
I understand you wanted to talk
to somebody about kidnapping.

566
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:40,577
That's why I'm calling.

567
01:10:40,644 --> 01:10:43,442
There's been a mistake.
There hasn't been a kidnapping.

568
01:10:44,515 --> 01:10:46,710
We're worried about you,
Mrs.Hayden.

569
01:10:46,784 --> 01:10:48,718
I'm fine. Really, I'm fine.

570
01:10:48,786 --> 01:10:51,914
I just wanted to clear it up.
There hasn't been a kidnapping.

571
01:10:51,989 --> 01:10:53,923
Where are you talking from?

572
01:10:53,991 --> 01:10:56,960
I don't know.
A truck stop somewhere.

573
01:10:57,027 --> 01:10:59,552
- Can I pick you up? I have questions.
- Miss?

574
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:01,325
Hold on a second.

575
01:11:01,398 --> 01:11:05,300
You lookin' for a fellow? About yea
tall? Red, plaid shirt? Nice-looking?

576
01:11:05,369 --> 01:11:06,802
Have you seen him?

577
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:10,203
He hitched a ride west with
our night cook about half an hour ago.

578
01:11:10,274 --> 01:11:12,208
Thank you very much.

579
01:11:12,276 --> 01:11:14,574
I'm hanging up now.
I've got to go.

580
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:16,977
If you want to talk to me,
call me in Madison in a few days.

581
01:11:17,047 --> 01:11:19,948
- I'm in the phone book.
- Wait, Mrs.Hayden!

582
01:11:20,017 --> 01:11:24,317
Do you know who or what
you were kidnapped by?

583
01:11:25,689 --> 01:11:28,681
He doesn't want to hurt anybody.

584
01:11:28,759 --> 01:11:31,489
Really, can't you
just leave him alone?

585
01:11:32,596 --> 01:11:35,724
Hello? Damn it!

586
01:11:38,235 --> 01:11:41,033
I need a ride west fast!

587
01:11:42,206 --> 01:11:45,437
Hey, I'll take ya.
Come on. Let's go.

588
01:12:02,826 --> 01:12:04,794
What's your line?

589
01:12:05,729 --> 01:12:07,526
- Line?
- Work?

590
01:12:07,598 --> 01:12:10,260
What do you do when
you're not hitchin' rides?

591
01:12:10,334 --> 01:12:12,393
Oh, I make maps.

592
01:12:12,469 --> 01:12:13,868
Make any money?

593
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:19,138
I make maps.

594
01:12:20,010 --> 01:12:23,377
You don't get rich cookin' either.
Believe me.

595
01:12:23,447 --> 01:12:26,905
I got a girl. She's gettin' ready
to go to college this fall.

596
01:12:26,984 --> 01:12:29,578
Wife had to go back to nursing
just to help me pay for it.

597
01:12:29,653 --> 01:12:31,621
Here. You want a smoke?

598
01:12:34,091 --> 01:12:37,390
Yep, my little baby.
Says she wants to be a doctor.

599
01:12:37,461 --> 01:12:39,122
I don't know.

600
01:12:39,196 --> 01:12:42,495
Costs an arm and a leg
to raise up kids these days.

601
01:12:42,566 --> 01:12:44,363
An arm and a leg?

602
01:12:44,434 --> 01:12:47,494
Bread, geetus, money
and lots of it.

603
01:13:06,456 --> 01:13:08,856
You all right?

604
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,721
You're not from
around here, are ya?

605
01:13:33,517 --> 01:13:39,285
What the john?
Some kind of roadblock, I guess.

606
01:13:39,923 --> 01:13:42,619
Roadblock, I guess.

607
01:13:55,806 --> 01:13:58,798
Better keep these people in line.
They're starting to slip around the end.

608
01:13:58,875 --> 01:14:00,809
Yes, sir. Sergeant,
you heard the man.

609
01:14:00,877 --> 01:14:02,469
Right away, sir.

610
01:14:02,546 --> 01:14:04,639
Get in line! Line up!

611
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,652
Move to the right.
Stay in line!

612
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:21,729
All you pedestrians, line up!

613
01:14:34,177 --> 01:14:37,078
Move to the right
and stay in line!

614
01:14:37,147 --> 01:14:39,877
Sir, would you put that dog
on a leash, please?

615
01:14:49,059 --> 01:14:50,651
You gotta help me, okay?

616
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,474
- Stop him!
- After that car!

617
01:15:52,722 --> 01:15:55,486
Thank God.
How did you get here?

618
01:15:55,559 --> 01:15:57,823
I hitched a ride with a cook.

619
01:16:00,163 --> 01:16:02,461
It is good to see you,
Jenny Hayden.

620
01:16:08,138 --> 01:16:11,039
We got to get out of here.
Come on.

621
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:12,541
Wait!

622
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:45,402
I have done something wrong?

623
01:16:51,915 --> 01:16:56,750
I wake up alone. You're gone.
Not a word. Nothing.

624
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:03,286
You were right. To be with me
is not good for your health.

625
01:17:04,861 --> 01:17:08,729
You could have at least told me
where you were going, said good-bye.

626
01:17:11,501 --> 01:17:12,900
Good-bye?

627
01:17:13,970 --> 01:17:15,403
Good-bye.

628
01:17:18,909 --> 01:17:21,503
You don't know what--

629
01:17:21,578 --> 01:17:23,512
Teach me this.

630
01:17:25,448 --> 01:17:28,042
I don't know. It's a custom.

631
01:17:29,419 --> 01:17:30,852
It's...

632
01:17:32,722 --> 01:17:36,522
how you tell somebody that
you miss them...

633
01:17:36,593 --> 01:17:38,993
that you wish them well...

634
01:17:39,062 --> 01:17:42,293
that you hope--

635
01:17:45,335 --> 01:17:48,065
Her tooth's coming in.

636
01:17:52,609 --> 01:17:55,134
Can anyone have babies?

637
01:17:58,615 --> 01:18:00,048
Just women.

638
01:18:02,152 --> 01:18:05,883
I understand the reproductive process
as you know it.

639
01:18:07,591 --> 01:18:09,525
As we know it?

640
01:18:13,496 --> 01:18:15,430
You have a baby?

641
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:21,069
No babies.

642
01:18:23,873 --> 01:18:25,306
Why not?

643
01:18:29,179 --> 01:18:33,843
Scott and I wanted
to have a baby.

644
01:18:33,917 --> 01:18:38,547
It just turned out I couldn't.

645
01:18:40,490 --> 01:18:43,823
I'm one of
those lucky ladies that...

646
01:18:43,893 --> 01:18:47,556
just can't have one.

647
01:19:17,927 --> 01:19:19,861
Here's a blanket. It's dry.

648
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:52,990
Better get out
of those wet clothes.

649
01:19:54,497 --> 01:19:56,431
Better get warm.

650
01:19:57,634 --> 01:20:00,296
You know what pneumonia is?
No?

651
01:20:00,370 --> 01:20:03,669
Well, you're gonna find out
unless we get you dry in a hurry.

652
01:20:12,148 --> 01:20:14,139
Here. Put this on.

653
01:22:28,418 --> 01:22:31,387
Mr.Fox said he's been delayed getting
out of Madison. He's gonna be late.

654
01:22:31,454 --> 01:22:33,046
What's going on?

655
01:22:33,122 --> 01:22:35,682
According to our best estimates,
speed, course and trajectory...

656
01:22:35,758 --> 01:22:38,124
that object was headed
for someplace in Arizona.

657
01:22:38,194 --> 01:22:41,686
Now Intelligence thinks the visitor
is on his way here to make a rendezvous.

658
01:22:41,764 --> 01:22:44,028
Go on inside.
Make yourself at home.

659
01:23:12,762 --> 01:23:15,026
Welcome to planet Earth.

660
01:23:41,724 --> 01:23:43,658
Where are we?

661
01:23:45,461 --> 01:23:48,828
I think we are coming
to Winslow soon.

662
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:05,875
Why didn't you wake me?

663
01:24:05,949 --> 01:24:08,782
I like to watch you sleep.

664
01:24:10,286 --> 01:24:12,220
I don't know why.

665
01:24:13,356 --> 01:24:14,789
It's strange.

666
01:24:16,025 --> 01:24:19,825
I think I am becoming
a planet Earth person.

667
01:24:20,496 --> 01:24:23,226
You have to go back?

668
01:24:24,968 --> 01:24:28,369
Isn't there someway you could stay?

669
01:24:30,473 --> 01:24:32,407
I must go back.

670
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:45,419
But there is something
I must tell you.

671
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:49,220
I gave you a baby tonight.

672
01:24:54,197 --> 01:24:57,098
That's impossible.
I can't have a child.

673
01:24:57,166 --> 01:25:00,693
I've been to a doctor,
a couple of them.

674
01:25:00,770 --> 01:25:03,238
Believe what I tell you.

675
01:25:05,675 --> 01:25:07,609
A boy baby.

676
01:25:10,313 --> 01:25:14,044
He will be human.
A baby of your husband, but...

677
01:25:14,117 --> 01:25:16,551
also he will be my baby.

678
01:25:18,721 --> 01:25:20,814
He will know everything I know...

679
01:25:20,890 --> 01:25:24,155
and when he grows to manhood,
he will be a teacher.

680
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:35,264
If you do not want this baby,
tell me now.

681
01:25:35,338 --> 01:25:37,863
I will stop it.

682
01:26:09,372 --> 01:26:12,637
Which is your star?
Can you see it from here?

683
01:26:12,709 --> 01:26:14,142
Why?

684
01:26:15,344 --> 01:26:19,075
I want to show him
where his father came from.

685
01:26:27,190 --> 01:26:28,623
There.

686
01:26:33,362 --> 01:26:34,795
Wait.

687
01:26:39,068 --> 01:26:40,729
There.

688
01:26:40,803 --> 01:26:42,430
Low in the sky.

689
01:26:46,509 --> 01:26:47,942
I see it.

690
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:59,153
You'd better get dressed.
We are coming to Winslow.

691
01:27:01,524 --> 01:27:04,516
I hope to God
we're on the right train.

692
01:27:04,594 --> 01:27:09,361
I don't know. That looks
awful big for Winslow, Arizona.

693
01:27:39,996 --> 01:27:41,429
Las Vegas.

694
01:27:42,498 --> 01:27:43,931
What?

695
01:27:45,635 --> 01:27:50,163
I think we've gone about
300 miles past Winslow.

696
01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:54,198
We're still gonna be okay.
All we got to do is rent a car.

697
01:27:54,277 --> 01:27:59,010
With a little luck, we'll be
back there before noon tomorrow.

698
01:27:59,081 --> 01:28:02,414
Just try not to be
too conspicuous, okay?

699
01:28:02,485 --> 01:28:03,918
Come on.

700
01:28:09,826 --> 01:28:13,387
Half a million dollars, folks!
Who's gonna take it home?

701
01:28:13,462 --> 01:28:18,593
Hit the giant jackpot and your troubles
are over. Half a million dollars!

702
01:28:18,668 --> 01:28:21,398
Define giant jackpot.

703
01:28:21,470 --> 01:28:23,904
A giant jackpot
is a lot of money.

704
01:28:23,973 --> 01:28:27,067
Money? Geetus? Bread?
An arm and a leg?

705
01:28:27,143 --> 01:28:29,111
Where did you get that?

706
01:28:29,178 --> 01:28:31,339
We don't have time to fool around
with the slot machines.

707
01:28:31,414 --> 01:28:33,507
We got to find a rent-a-car place--

708
01:28:36,152 --> 01:28:38,120
Where's my wallet?

709
01:28:38,187 --> 01:28:40,087
- My wallet?
- What is wrong?

710
01:28:40,156 --> 01:28:43,023
Where the hell is my wallet?

711
01:28:44,393 --> 01:28:47,624
- What are we gonna do now?
- Is all right.

712
01:28:47,697 --> 01:28:50,063
You don't understand.
No credit card, no money, no car.

713
01:28:50,132 --> 01:28:52,191
No car, we're never
gonna get there on time.

714
01:28:52,268 --> 01:28:54,202
Is all right.

715
01:29:01,310 --> 01:29:02,743
Now.

716
01:29:08,851 --> 01:29:10,785
Damn.

717
01:29:26,869 --> 01:29:30,361
That's a handy little talent you got
there, but you better spread it around.

718
01:29:30,439 --> 01:29:34,375
These guys get curious
if you hit too many jackpots at once.

719
01:30:07,043 --> 01:30:10,410
Choppers from Air Cav will
search the area on a quarter-mile grid.

720
01:30:10,479 --> 01:30:13,039
- Good. I'm glad you're here.
- What the hell is this about?

721
01:30:13,115 --> 01:30:15,208
You're a man of
some scientific attainment.

722
01:30:15,284 --> 01:30:18,811
You don't recognize an emergency
autopsy room when you see one?

723
01:30:18,888 --> 01:30:23,348
- With leather tie straps?
- You behave yourself, Mark.

724
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:25,827
This your latest update?

725
01:30:25,895 --> 01:30:29,524
According to NORAD, his original course
and rate of descent...

726
01:30:29,598 --> 01:30:32,931
would have taken him here,
south of Winslow.

727
01:30:33,002 --> 01:30:36,335
- I see. Anything else?
- The Cobra guys asked about ammunition.

728
01:30:36,405 --> 01:30:40,034
Helicopter attack units
will carry live ammo at all times.

729
01:30:40,109 --> 01:30:43,101
- This is a combat mission.
- Right.

730
01:30:45,982 --> 01:30:50,009
Listen, Mr.Fox,
I'd like to be a team player...

731
01:30:50,086 --> 01:30:52,281
but there's something
I want to call to your attention.

732
01:30:52,355 --> 01:30:55,381
One thing I don't need from you
is a lecture on morality.

733
01:30:55,458 --> 01:30:57,619
All right. Okay. Screw morality.

734
01:30:57,693 --> 01:31:00,719
What the hell ever happened to
good manners? We invited him here!

735
01:31:00,796 --> 01:31:03,060
- I don't have time for this.
- I'm trying to make a point.

736
01:31:03,132 --> 01:31:04,997
So am I! Damn it!

737
01:31:05,067 --> 01:31:08,525
You make a great show of being a rebel,
but the fact is this:

738
01:31:08,604 --> 01:31:11,573
You are a GS-11 public servant.

739
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:14,700
Anytime that becomes
too much of a burden...

740
01:31:14,777 --> 01:31:19,407
you can go back to Cornell or wherever
the hell it was that we found you.

741
01:31:19,482 --> 01:31:21,848
Let's see you make it through
on an instructor's salary.

742
01:31:21,917 --> 01:31:26,013
Now shape up or get out.
Is that clear?

743
01:31:26,088 --> 01:31:28,818
There's been a possible sighting
in Las Vegas.

744
01:31:29,859 --> 01:31:34,558
- They're probably headed this direction.
- Establish a command post in Winslow.

745
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:39,130
You'd better get out there...

746
01:31:39,201 --> 01:31:42,193
providing, of course, you still
want to be a member of the team.

747
01:31:42,271 --> 01:31:44,034
You do, don't you?

748
01:31:46,642 --> 01:31:48,610
- Yes, sir.
- All right then, get going.

749
01:31:49,879 --> 01:31:52,439
Get rid of that damn cigar.

750
01:32:01,424 --> 01:32:05,155
We ought to be coming
to the crater anytime now.

751
01:32:06,195 --> 01:32:08,925
You're gonna make it.
You're gonna go home.

752
01:32:10,933 --> 01:32:14,767
- You want to, don't you?
- Yes, of course.

753
01:32:23,913 --> 01:32:25,904
What's it like up there?

754
01:32:26,782 --> 01:32:28,977
It is beautiful.

755
01:32:29,051 --> 01:32:31,611
Not like this,
but it is beautiful.

756
01:32:32,721 --> 01:32:36,282
There is only one language,
one law, one people.

757
01:32:36,358 --> 01:32:41,796
There is no war, no hunger. The strong
do not victimize the helpless.

758
01:32:41,864 --> 01:32:47,029
We are very civilized,
but we have lost something, I think.

759
01:32:48,437 --> 01:32:51,600
You are all so much alive,
all so different.

760
01:32:53,576 --> 01:32:58,206
I will miss the cooks
and the singing and the dancing...

761
01:32:58,280 --> 01:32:59,941
and the eating...

762
01:33:16,365 --> 01:33:18,765
and the other things.

763
01:33:43,259 --> 01:33:45,693
Mornin', folks.
What'll you have?

764
01:33:45,761 --> 01:33:49,026
- Oh, coffee.
- Dutch apple pie?

765
01:33:49,098 --> 01:33:53,159
- How about some nice cherry cobbler?
- That'll be fine.

766
01:33:57,740 --> 01:34:01,073
- And whipped cream.
- Comin' right up.

767
01:34:01,143 --> 01:34:03,475
How long does it take
to get to the crater from here?

768
01:34:03,546 --> 01:34:07,448
Driving? Not long.
Five, six minutes is all.

769
01:34:07,516 --> 01:34:10,144
I want you to try
this cherry cobbler.

770
01:34:10,219 --> 01:34:15,020
And if you don't like it,
you don't have to pay for it.

771
01:34:18,594 --> 01:34:21,222
- It's delicious.
- My wife made it.

772
01:34:22,698 --> 01:34:25,064
Is very good.

773
01:34:47,523 --> 01:34:49,957
Do you have somebody...

774
01:34:51,026 --> 01:34:52,516
a wife, like...

775
01:34:53,329 --> 01:34:54,762
up there?

776
01:35:00,803 --> 01:35:02,100
I wish--

777
01:35:04,073 --> 01:35:07,304
- I wish--
- What?

778
01:35:14,817 --> 01:35:17,513
Mornin', folks.
Is that your Cadillac outside?

779
01:36:16,545 --> 01:36:18,479
All right, go ahead.

780
01:36:21,517 --> 01:36:23,212
Yeah, hold it. Yeah.

781
01:36:32,528 --> 01:36:34,792
I'd like to talk
to these people alone.

782
01:36:34,863 --> 01:36:38,128
I'll be right outside
if you need me.

783
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:41,363
George Fox just called in
on the radio.

784
01:36:41,437 --> 01:36:43,962
Said to say
they're on their way over.

785
01:37:02,524 --> 01:37:05,084
I'm Mark Shermin.

786
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:08,061
SETI? The Search
For Extraterrestrial--

787
01:37:10,899 --> 01:37:13,663
Mrs.Hayden,
we talked on the phone.

788
01:37:14,970 --> 01:37:17,063
This is just such a--

789
01:37:19,842 --> 01:37:21,469
Mind if I sit down?

790
01:37:26,081 --> 01:37:28,174
There's so many questions
that I'd like to ask you.

791
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:30,445
I hardly even know where to begin.

792
01:37:31,453 --> 01:37:33,580
Is there anything I can do for you?

793
01:37:33,655 --> 01:37:35,589
You can let him go.

794
01:37:35,657 --> 01:37:37,056
I can't.

795
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:42,829
Really, I can't.
I'm sorry. Is it--

796
01:37:42,898 --> 01:37:46,334
- Are you supposed to meet someone here?
- Yes.

797
01:37:46,402 --> 01:37:48,927
You don't understand.
There isn't much time. Please.

798
01:37:49,004 --> 01:37:51,336
Why here? Why the crater?

799
01:37:52,975 --> 01:37:55,603
Have people from your world
been here before?

800
01:37:55,677 --> 01:38:01,172
Before, yes.
We are interested in your species.

801
01:38:02,418 --> 01:38:05,285
You mean, you're some kind
of an anthropologist?

802
01:38:05,354 --> 01:38:08,050
Is that what you're doing here?
Just checking us out?

803
01:38:08,123 --> 01:38:12,253
You are a strange species,
not like any other.

804
01:38:13,695 --> 01:38:16,323
And you would be surprised
how many there are.

805
01:38:16,398 --> 01:38:18,992
Intelligent but savage.

806
01:38:22,037 --> 01:38:25,006
Shall I tell you what
I find beautiful about you?

807
01:38:29,044 --> 01:38:33,572
You are at your very best
when things are worst.

808
01:38:33,649 --> 01:38:36,174
Let him go, Mr.Shermin, please.

809
01:38:40,289 --> 01:38:44,123
If he stays here, he'll die.

810
01:38:47,763 --> 01:38:50,254
Can't you see he's dying now?

811
01:39:00,142 --> 01:39:01,575
Thank you.

812
01:39:09,818 --> 01:39:11,251
Thank you.

813
01:39:38,313 --> 01:39:42,443
Wrong ones, huh?
They sure as hell fit the description.

814
01:39:42,518 --> 01:39:47,251
No, the guy we're lookin' for
is a lot older.

815
01:40:11,079 --> 01:40:13,604
Where are they?
What have you done with them?

816
01:40:13,682 --> 01:40:15,616
Trooper,
where are your prisoners?

817
01:40:15,684 --> 01:40:18,175
Wrong ones.
We had to let 'em go.

818
01:40:18,253 --> 01:40:19,686
You what?

819
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:34,691
Shermin, you are finished.

820
01:40:34,770 --> 01:40:37,830
I will have you
eviscerated for this.

821
01:40:37,906 --> 01:40:41,205
Well, as much as I hate
to stoop to symbolism--

822
01:41:32,628 --> 01:41:34,562
I hear something.

823
01:43:22,971 --> 01:43:27,499
All units, this is Fox.
I want warning fire only.

824
01:43:27,576 --> 01:43:29,168
When ready, roger that.

825
01:43:29,244 --> 01:43:31,576
I copy. Here we go.

826
01:44:18,693 --> 01:44:24,393
Mrs.Hayden, you and your companion
must stop immediately.

827
01:44:24,466 --> 01:44:27,458
Stop where you are
or we will open fire.

828
01:44:27,536 --> 01:44:31,734
I repeat. Stop where you are.

829
01:44:31,807 --> 01:44:35,038
We have orders to open fire.

830
01:44:37,379 --> 01:44:39,847
Last warning, Mrs.Hayden.

831
01:44:39,915 --> 01:44:43,407
You and your companion
must stop immediately.

832
01:44:43,485 --> 01:44:46,010
We have orders to open fire.

833
01:45:12,447 --> 01:45:14,438
Last warning, Mrs.Hayden.

834
01:45:14,516 --> 01:45:17,849
For your own safety,
you must stop where you are.

835
01:45:49,651 --> 01:45:51,619
What the hell is that?

836
01:48:02,851 --> 01:48:04,785
I must go.

837
01:48:06,888 --> 01:48:09,584
- Take me with you.
- I cannot.

838
01:48:09,657 --> 01:48:12,251
- Please.
- You will die there.

839
01:48:12,327 --> 01:48:15,660
- I don't think I care.
- I care.

840
01:48:15,730 --> 01:48:18,255
Now...

841
01:48:18,333 --> 01:48:22,827
tell me again
how to say good-bye.

842
01:48:25,407 --> 01:48:27,341
Kiss me...

843
01:48:29,310 --> 01:48:31,505
then tell me you love me.

844
01:48:33,114 --> 01:48:35,048
I love you.

845
01:48:41,456 --> 01:48:44,721
I'm never gonna
see you again, am I?

846
01:48:52,067 --> 01:48:54,001
I love you.

847
01:49:04,312 --> 01:49:07,213
Tell the baby about me.

848
01:49:08,883 --> 01:49:10,714
I will.

849
01:49:28,069 --> 01:49:30,162
What should I do with this?

850
01:49:31,239 --> 01:49:33,537
The baby will know.

851
01:49:38,413 --> 01:49:40,574
Good-bye, Jenny Hayden.

852
01:49:47,822 --> 01:49:49,255
Good-bye.
