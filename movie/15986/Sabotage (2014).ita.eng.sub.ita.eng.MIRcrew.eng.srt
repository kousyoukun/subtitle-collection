00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:50,424
FIREFIGHTER: All right,
let's cut him down.

789
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:54,261
From a preliminary
investigation, I have
a cause of death.

790
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:55,846
Massive hemothorax.

791
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:58,682
From a right
ventricular
stab wound.

792
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:01,059
This, where
my finger is...
Uh-huh.

793
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,312
That's how far the knife
went inside his chest.

794
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:06,273
CAROLINE: Okay.
CORONER: And they
gutted him like a pig.

795
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:09,776
Hey, Doc,
this guy's a trained guy.

796
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,528
Who could walk up on
a trained guy like that?

797
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:13,780
Somebody that had
better skills than he had.

798
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:16,408
He knew exactly
where he was stabbing.

799
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:19,244
Boo-yah! Got some hairs.
Not the victim's.

800
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:21,121
Show me.
Right here.

801
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:22,831
And here's some more. Here.

802
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,541
Can you bag those?
Sure.

803
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:26,960
I'll take them
to the lab myself.

804
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,086
Okay.

805
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:30,631
Thanks, guys.
CORONER: Sure.

806
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:32,466
Thanks.
ASSISTANT: You got it.

807
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:40,557
You know, in Northern Ireland,
the IRA nailed snitches
to the kitchen floor.

808
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:41,975
How do you know
shit like that?

809
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,435
Some research
I was doing.

810
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:46,980
Okay, so you put out a BOLO
for Lucky Charms guy.
(LAUGHS)

811
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:50,817
Hey, take a criminalist
and sweep the RV's cab.

812
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:52,569
For what?
What am I looking for?

813
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,196
Linkage.

814
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:56,990
(ENGINE STARTS)

815
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:06,500
They're dead and we're not.
What are we doing?

816
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:09,127
We D-up and
present a hard target.

817
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:12,589
Like taking showers
with full body armor.

818
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:15,175
Well, we need
fucking intel.

819
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,761
Who'd they send up?
Well, who do you think,
sweetheart?

820
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:18,929
Check the board!

821
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,223
Could be Soto!
Could be fucking Romero!

822
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:22,516
It could be fucking...
They could be...

823
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,892
(STAMMERING)
They may be... Fucking...

824
00:43:23,977 --> 00:43:26,019
Any of this
a surprise to you?

825
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,730
Just let it go, huh?

826
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:29,898
Surprise to you, Sugar?

827
00:43:29,983 --> 00:43:31,984
I don't really know
what you're talking about.

828
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:36,488
Guess I'm the only one
with any fucking balls here.

829
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,033
It's the goddamn money.

830
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,870
MONSTER: Just let
it go, all right?
No!

831
00:43:44,998 --> 00:43:46,957
We had to go fingering
the devil's pussy.

832
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:50,419
It's an occupational
hazard when you
fight the cartels.

833
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:51,837
Oh, really?

834
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:53,797
You see any other
Feds getting smoked?

835
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:56,091
It could happen to anyone.
Bullshit!

836
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:58,927
You believe
that, chief?

837
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:02,306
Or is that just some shit
you're spitting in case
this place is bugged?

838
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:06,393
Always assume that
someone is listening.

839
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,273
So shut the fuck up.

840
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,195
I ain't gonna
fight you, boss.

841
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,607
Where the fuck
are you going?

842
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:39,569
Out.

843
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,030
I'm bored.

844
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,532
You're not going out.

845
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:45,200
It's not safe.

846
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:47,411
They're hunting us.

847
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:49,830
I can take care
of myself.

848
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:51,415
Give me
that fucking...
No!

849
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:54,751
Give that back to me.
Give that back to me!
Monster!

850
00:45:55,628 --> 00:45:56,920
What's this, huh?

851
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,255
Is this chewing gum?

852
00:45:58,339 --> 00:45:59,548
Huh?
Yeah.

853
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,925
What the fuck
you need this for?

854
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,927
What the fuck do
you need this for?

855
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,011
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

856
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:06,721
Get out of my way.
No, Lizzy.

857
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:16,189
(LIZZY LAUGHS)

858
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,399
It's the stripper.

859
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:19,109
CAROLINE:
Can we talk inside?

860
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:20,402
LIZZY: What the fuck
do you want?

861
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,489
Just some background
information on
your unit.

862
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:27,117
So I can develop
some suspects.

863
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:33,665
You know
what we do, right?

864
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:37,502
This special
operations team?

865
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:39,296
Well, to be honest,
I have no idea.

866
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,755
Why don't you tell me?

867
00:46:41,591 --> 00:46:42,757
We covertly

868
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,385
penetrate

869
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,430
drug
organizations.

870
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:51,683
I guess that
would make you
some enemies, huh?

871
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:53,852
Any one come
to mind?
(BOTH LAUGH)

872
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,270
Any particular guy

873
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:58,899
that might nail Special Agent
Jordan to a ceiling?

874
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:01,485
Are you really
this stupid?
(LAUGHS)

875
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,320
Ma'am, I'm not your friend,

876
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:04,738
and I'm not your colleague.

877
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,490
So don't bully me.

878
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:07,532
Or I'll slap you

879
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:08,742
with a 48-hour jail hold.

880
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:09,868
And by the
looks of things,

881
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:12,329
you can't hack a day
without your favorite
controlled substance.

882
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:13,955
So let's keep it nice,
shall we?

883
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,916
And yes,
assume I'm stupid.

884
00:47:16,209 --> 00:47:17,918
Paint me a picture.

885
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,045
Please.

886
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:29,971
I took these
in Juarez.

887
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,474
They're friends of mine.

888
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,726
And this is what
the Rios-Garza cartel does

889
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:37,062
to indicate that
you've pissed them off.

890
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:43,276
Sweetheart,
you're so in over
your fucking head.

891
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:46,905
You need more
than a Glock and
sensible shoes.

892
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:48,782
MONSTER:
Walk away.

893
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:51,076
Walk away.

894
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:59,251
I'll show myself out.
Thank you for your time.

895
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:01,002
It's our pleasure.

896
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:03,797
LAB TECHNICIAN:
We're gonna have
to each get two jobs

897
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:05,382
just to put him
through school.

898
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:07,133
CAROLINE: Have you
considered prostitution?

899
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:09,344
Hey, what's up?
More black hairs.

900
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:11,221
And look.

901
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:14,015
A beautiful thumbprint
we got off the steering
column of the RV.

902
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,560
It's not the vic's.
Boo-yeah! Linkage.

903
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:18,687
You just said
"boo-yeah."

904
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:22,148
That's my thing.
Don't jack my thing.

905
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:26,820
I heard the lab tech
say it. (LAUGHS)

906
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:28,738
I didn't hear it.

907
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,115
Bullshit, you heard it.

908
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:31,866
Well, if she said it,
she got it from me.

909
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:37,455
Due to the staging
of Special Agent
Jordan's body,

910
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:40,166
we believe
there's a connection
to the Rios-Garza cartel.

911
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:43,712
DTO. Rios-Garza Drug
Trafficking Organization.

912
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:45,797
We don't use
the term "cartel."

913
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:48,174
Thank you, sir.

914
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:49,759
It seems that Special Agent
Roberts' death

915
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:50,927
was not an accident.

916
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:53,763
We have recovered
physical evidence linking
the two crime scenes.

917
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:55,348
I would like to have
a copy of those files,

918
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:57,017
if you could make
those available for me.

919
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:59,728
Yes, sir.
Today, would that
be all right?

920
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:01,771
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

921
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:04,107
Investigator Brentwood,
what exactly do
you want from us?

922
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:07,027
Well, learning about
the victims helps me
find the suspects.

923
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:10,947
Maybe these murders
are blowback from
cases they worked on.

924
00:49:11,032 --> 00:49:13,241
You want access
to DEA case files?

925
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:14,618
It would help.

926
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:17,579
Are you asking for
investigatory support
or access to our records?

927
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:18,663
Both.

928
00:49:18,748 --> 00:49:19,748
Look, maybe
there's someone

929
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:20,874
I can liaise with,
someone who...

930
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:21,958
Investigator Brentwood,

931
00:49:22,043 --> 00:49:24,711
your agency needs to
draft a formal letter
requesting assistance.

932
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:28,006
Any documents you want
access to will need to
be specifically cited.

933
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,050
Specifically cited.
What information
do you need?

934
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:32,886
Incident report numbers.
File numbers.

935
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:33,970
Right.

936
00:49:34,055 --> 00:49:35,263
And how are we going
to know those numbers

937
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,223
if we don't know
those numbers?

938
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:38,808
If you don't know
really what you want,

939
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:41,102
what are you
doing here?

940
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,396
Two murders of DEA agents

941
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:45,065
have happened on my watch.

942
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:46,858
And it's my job to
investigate them,

943
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,568
and I'm asking for your help.

944
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:51,655
Just have the chief
fire off a letter, and
we'll see what we can do.

945
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,783
Thank you
for coming in.

946
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:56,910
CAROLINE:
Have a nice day, y'all.

947
00:49:57,286 --> 00:50:00,413
Fucking US Attorney
and their own general counsel?

948
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:01,581
These guys are scared.

949
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:03,833
Hey. You're Brentwood,
you're Jackson, right?

950
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:04,918
BOTH: Yeah.

951
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,670
You working the agent
nailed to the ceiling?

952
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:08,213
What do you know about that?

953
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:10,340
The DEA is a dysfunctional
family, all right?

954
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,342
No one's going to talk
family business with you.

955
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,510
Who are you?
Got a card?

956
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:14,678
Ask yourself
why it happened.

957
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:17,972
Everything happens
for a reason.
Think about that.

958
00:50:23,104 --> 00:50:25,438
Stop leaving your
shit on my seat.

959
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:26,815
That's not mine.

960
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:29,275
It's not some porn
you're hiding from
your wife?

961
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,443
(SCOFFS)

962
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:31,861
That's not mine.

963
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,113
It's not mine.

964
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:36,074
STAN: You're out here saving
these adrenaline junkies

965
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:39,035
that mean absolutely nothing
to this department.

966
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:40,787
BREACHER: I would take
a bullet for those guys.

967
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:42,163
Hmm. You'd take a bullet.

968
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:43,373
Would you take
10 million bucks?

969
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,333
Would you take
$10 million?

970
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:46,751
Where's the money?

971
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,086
Don't fucking
scream at me!

972
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,255
Where's the money?
You dumb fuck, you!

973
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:51,464
Look at you!

974
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:53,341
With your fucking
48% body fat.

975
00:50:53,426 --> 00:50:55,802
And, you, scrawny
little bastard!

976
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:57,804
Fuck you guys!
LOU: Go to the gym, John.

977
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:01,391
Fucking liar.
Fucking liar!

978
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:02,934
He's a fucking liar.

979
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:05,979
What? Caroline,
where you going?

980
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,272
(KNOCKING)

981
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:12,485
Why the fuck
didn't you tell me

982
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:16,781
you were under investigation
for stealing from
the Rios-Garza cartel?

983
00:51:16,866 --> 00:51:18,032
Get in.

984
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:19,659
I need a drink.

985
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:42,599
I need you to be
straight with me, John.

986
00:51:42,892 --> 00:51:44,434
No, you be
straight with me.

987
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,519
Why do I have to find out
through the grapevine

988
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:48,146
that you linked
the deaths of my people?

989
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,898
They're linked,
I'm sorry. My turn.

990
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:51,274
Did you steal
the money?

991
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:52,817
No.

992
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:54,861
And fuck you
for asking.
Don't be such a girl.

993
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:58,406
Your agency thinks you did.
So does the Rios-Garza cartel.

994
00:51:58,491 --> 00:52:00,325
Why do you think
they're killing your guys?

995
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:03,578
Spend enough
time on the job,
the job bites back.

996
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:05,288
That's bullshit.

997
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:09,042
You going somewhere?

998
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,504
One of my guys
quit the team.
He's off the grid.

999
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,380
I gotta warn him.

1000
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:17,383
Okay, grab your stuff
and I'll drive.

1001
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:23,223
They're going to continue
to fucking kill people,

1002
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:24,974
and kill fucking
innocent people

1003
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:27,602
and women and children
in Mexico and
the United States

1004
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:29,395
unless you have
guys like me!
LOU: Son!

1005
00:52:29,522 --> 00:52:30,563
That's a fact.
Son!

1006
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:32,732
Motherfucker, I quit.

1007
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:41,157
Last fall, an 8-year-old girl
vanished from her bed.

1008
00:52:41,242 --> 00:52:42,242
No leads.

1009
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:46,579
Only her daddy's bullshit
about hearing black voices.

1010
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:51,876
And he's a drinker.
Joins AA the week
after she disappears.

1011
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:53,878
He profiles, too.

1012
00:52:53,963 --> 00:52:55,839
Domestic abuser, all that.

1013
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,173
And I can't find enough

1014
00:52:57,258 --> 00:52:58,258
for the DA to file.

1015
00:52:58,551 --> 00:52:59,759
Do you see where
this is going?

1016
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:02,762
Just because you're
not in jail doesn't
mean you didn't do it.

1017
00:53:03,556 --> 00:53:04,681
You're awesome
on a road trip,

1018
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:05,765
you know that?

1019
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:08,059
Yeah, I've heard
that before.

1020
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:24,993
BREACHER: That's it,
right there.

1021
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:33,376
It's beautiful.

1022
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:35,461
Watch out for
booby traps.

1023
00:53:37,298 --> 00:53:38,590
CAROLINE: Bullshit.

1024
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:40,925
BREACHER: I'm serious.

1025
00:53:41,302 --> 00:53:43,803
This could take
your leg right off.

1026
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:45,638
Here's the trip wire.

1027
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:51,644
Why is he so paranoid?

1028
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:54,397
Maybe he doesn't want to
get nailed to a ceiling.

1029
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:08,953
Tripod!

1030
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:17,211
McNeely?

1031
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:20,173
It's John!

1032
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:35,939
There's something off.

1033
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:22,735
(SCREAMS)

1034
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:12,952
Fuck.

1035
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,708
Unit 2150.

1036
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:23,337
Send me two units
and an ME to my location.

1037
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,494
AK brass.

1038
00:56:57,998 --> 00:56:59,957
The guy hit
the trip wire.

1039
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:02,210
Right there.

1040
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:12,804
Looks like
he bled out.

1041
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,142
Here, hold this.

1042
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:27,401
CAROLINE:
What's that?

1043
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:29,195
BREACHER:
They're world-class assholes.

1044
00:57:31,532 --> 00:57:34,450
Give me the weapon.
I don't trust you.

1045
00:57:34,535 --> 00:57:36,911
Well, you know,
it was getting
heavy anyway.

1046
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,042
(GROANING)

1047
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,419
(MEN LAUGHING)

1048
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,052
(KNOCKING)
Hey! (GASPS)

1049
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:55,763
How you feeling?

1050
00:57:57,391 --> 00:57:58,391
I'm sorry?

1051
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:01,394
Well, now that
you got sucked
into our world.

1052
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:08,734
They're Kaibiles.

1053
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:10,528
Kaibiles?

1054
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:12,446
Guatemalan
Special Forces.

1055
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:13,781
Okay.

1056
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:17,577
Rios-Garza Organization
loves to use them
for high-power hits.

1057
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:23,916
You know, McNeely was
a fucking Navy SEAL.

1058
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:30,423
He was 10 times
the operator that
I'll ever be.

1059
00:58:33,886 --> 00:58:36,179
What chance do
you think I got?

1060
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:41,934
See, they're the best
assassins that money
can buy.

1061
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:45,062
Honey, I worked gangs
for eight years.

1062
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:46,522
Streets have rules, okay?

1063
00:58:46,607 --> 00:58:48,191
You steal money,
doesn't matter
who you are,

1064
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:50,318
you can be a cop,
you could be God,

1065
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:52,653
they will get you.

1066
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:55,489
I came here
to help you.

1067
00:58:55,574 --> 00:58:57,241
No, you did not.
To help you understand.

1068
00:58:57,326 --> 00:58:58,868
You came here 'cause you
think you're gonna be next.

1069
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:01,204
You came here to
steer me, okay?

1070
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:02,371
If you want
to help me,

1071
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:04,207
and if you don't
want to get nailed
to a ceiling

1072
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:06,334
or run over
by a train,

1073
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:08,336
you need to break
free from your buddies

1074
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:11,714
and tell me something
I don't know about
John Wharton.

1075
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:12,757
Because I can't
read him.

1076
00:59:12,841 --> 00:59:14,342
Tell me something
I don't know.

1077
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:22,350
Two years ago,

1078
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:24,894
we arrested
Edgar Rios in Juarez.

1079
00:59:25,646 --> 00:59:28,814
He was
an old-school drug lord,
ran all their operations.

1080
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:39,825
It was a big deal.

1081
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:56,342
We're handing him
over to the Mexicans

1082
00:59:58,387 --> 01:00:01,138
when some broad
pulls her shit
and dumps him.

1083
01:00:04,977 --> 01:00:08,187
Cartel didn't
want him debriefed
by our intel people.

1084
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:13,359
Problem solved.

1085
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:15,861
(INAUDIBLE)

1086
01:00:20,409 --> 01:00:22,285
But they had
a bigger problem.

1087
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:28,249
They wanted the man
who can get the man
that nobody can get.

1088
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:37,508
John gets a call

1089
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:39,719
from the bad guys.

1090
01:00:42,014 --> 01:00:46,183
They snatched his wife
and kid right out of
his house on Lake Lanier.

1091
01:00:47,269 --> 01:00:49,312
They're holding
them in Juarez.

1092
01:00:50,689 --> 01:00:52,565
They make him an offer.

1093
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:57,194
"Surrender yourself
to the cartel and
your family lives."

1094
01:00:58,363 --> 01:00:59,989
John's family is everything.

1095
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,533
John was married forever.

1096
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:06,871
His son Jacob was
his best friend.

1097
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:08,247
Love you, Dad.

1098
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:11,250
(SCREAMING)

1099
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:14,503
They tortured Karen

went down there. Alone.

1105
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,859

who killed his wife.

bring you back home.

1109

This isn't going
to bring them back.

1110

TRIPOD: Come on.
Let's go home.

1111
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:26,700
MONSTER: John is
obsessed with finding
his wife's killer.

1112
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:32,456
It's like a cancer
in his soul.

1113
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:42,675
Caroline, we lost John
when they died.

1114
01:02:48,056 --> 01:02:49,140
Go home.

1115
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,354
Go home now.

1116
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,108
I was just
trying to help.

1117
01:03:10,871 --> 01:03:12,246
I'm sorry.

1118
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:15,082
I'm so sorry.

1119
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:22,339
John.

1120
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:26,927
Wait up. I didn't
know about your family.
John, I'm sorry, I...

1121
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:31,432
Now you know.

1122
01:03:31,725 --> 01:03:33,809
They sent me her face.

1123

So this isn't creepy.

1126
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:05,925
Someone else get killed?

1127
01:04:06,051 --> 01:04:08,302
I brought
a peace offering.

1128
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:21,857
Let me show
you something.

1129
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,778
Your shooters.
They're Guatemalan
Special Forces.

1130
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:29,532
They came in
through Juarez
with stolen visas.

1131
01:04:29,616 --> 01:04:32,451
ICE alerted,
ran surveillance.

1132
01:04:32,661 --> 01:04:34,537
But lost them
outside of Atlanta.

1133
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:36,205
Now, you said
you had prints.

1134
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:39,833
Yeah. We got one
at the RV,

1135
01:04:39,918 --> 01:04:41,710
and one outside
McNeely's cabin.

1136
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:43,754
But no NCIC hits.

1137
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:46,090
See if these match.

1138
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:53,138
Pretty please.

1139
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:02,856
ICE took them off
some beer cans inside
their hotel room.

1140
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:06,527
Should I have these?

1141
01:05:06,987 --> 01:05:08,612
No.

1142
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:13,158
Then why'd you
give them to me?

1143
01:05:14,202 --> 01:05:16,579
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

1144

Don't say a word.

Mmm-mmm-mmm.

1148

What happened to
"I'll never date a cop"?

1149
01:05:48,612 --> 01:05:50,946
Who said anything
about a date?

you said that.

You dirty,

1153
01:05:58,288 --> 01:05:59,622

Prints, records,
everything.

1160
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,639
Did he leave it on
your night stand?

1161

Get in the car.

'Cause you walking funny.

1164

You're just jealous.

1165

1166
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,653
Like, is he big?

1167
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:32,154
That's inappropriate.

Shut up. Shut up.

1169

gonna tell the judge?

1177

That we got slipped
some Secret Squirrel
ICE file?

1178

That's exactly what
I'm going to tell him.

1179

Negative.

got no target?

That ICE file your

had a credit card.

I'm sorry. I was excited.
