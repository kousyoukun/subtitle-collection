<i>He's not calling, he's not coming!</i>

12
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,510
<i>Why isn't he coming?
He doesn't love you.</i>

13

<i>Oh, my God! Oh, my God!</i>

20
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:06,460
Three out. Arm the charge.

21
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,470
Don't blow your balls off, okay.

22
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,470
Hey, don't worry.
They're made of brass.

23
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,100
Are they as big as your wife's?

24
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,140
Who the fuck dropped ass?

25
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,140
- That was me.
- Better check your fucking drawers.

26
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,650
I think that was brisket, wasn't it?
Wasn't that brisket?

27
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,440
Open a fucking window!

28
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:28,850
Hey, shut the fuck up!
Concentrate! It's payday.

29
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,570
Hell, yeah.

30
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,800
Look at you.

31
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,120
Done a roll call?

32
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,580
Breacher and his men
are all accounted for.

33
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,850
How much is in there?

34
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,620
We're about to find out.

35
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,590
DC will be very happy.

36
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,190
<i>Okay, be ready.</i>

37
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,530

<i>Roger.</i>

39
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,880
Fuck that! No! I'm going
to hit you fucking raw.

40
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,850
Okay. Come here, baby!

41
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,490
Come on.

42
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,550
All right, come on.

43
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,790
Lizzy, radio check.

44
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,260
Do you copy me?

45
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,900
I hear nothing!

46
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,370
What are you talking about?

47
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,430
I can only hear your
heartbeat. Come on!

48
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,270
God damn it, Lizzy! Do you copy me?

49
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,870
Bad call, boss, sending her in.

50
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,640
Oh, relax.

51
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,410
She knows how to take
care of her business.

52
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:07,950
I got movement.

53
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,120
Second story, front window.

54
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,590
Center lock.

55
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,660
I'm taking the shot.

56
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,940
- Here we go!
- Let's move, let's move!

57
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,870
- Come on! Move it!
- Stack it up. Stack it up.

58
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,450
<i>Puta!</i>

59
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,790
Shots fired. Delta side.

60
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,430
- Neck, stay close with me!
- Already out!

61
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,960
Hey! Hey, where's my
shit? I'm going in!

62
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,000
- You're not going in!
- I know where the money is! Do you?

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,770
Let's go long!

64
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,500
Fuck, Lizzy! You look
hot, baby! Whoo!

65
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,940
Stack up.

66
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,960
- Pyro, get the window!
- On it.

67
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,270
Let's go.

68
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,480
Tripod, clear.

69
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,050
Breach. Breach!

70
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,320
- Get in there!
- Move it!

71
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,320
- I got high!
- Okay, I got back!

72
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,590
Come on, y'all!

73
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,790
Clear right!

74
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,760
<i>Cut the lock.
Lizzy, there's a fucking gate!</i>

75
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,700
- No shit. Take this.
- Got it.

76
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,910
- Anybody hurt?
- I'm good.

77
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,580
Tripod! Demo!

78
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,980
Aw, shit, I think I broke a nail.

79
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,580
- Double up!
- Give me the charge.

80
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,480
- What are we doing, boss?
- Demo set.

81
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,520
Three, two, one!

82
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,760
Pyro, shoot the fucker!

83
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,960
- Target down! Good shot!
- Dead.

84
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,360
- Get moving!
- Get inside!

85
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,030
- Breaching shotgun!
- Pop it!

86
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,700
Move it!

87
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,500
- Lizzy, where's the money?
- Down that hall.

88
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,690
Spider hole in the ceiling.

89
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,710
Target down! Move it!

90
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,940
- Watch your head.
- Good shot.

91
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,850
- Popped his gray.
- Meat shower.

92
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,650
Target.

93
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,060
- Down!
- Let's move!

94
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,890
- Saw shit like this in Iraq.
- Door is on the right.

95
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,960
Stand clear!

96
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,790
- Moving up.
- Everyone, get out of my fucking way!

97
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,550
Kick it, Tripod, let's go!

98
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,370
- Keep it tight!
- I'll take the back.

99
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,530
Pyro, I'm behind you.

100
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,660
- Cover your sides!
- You got it, boss!

101
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,510
- Clear.
- Let's move.

102
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,410
Clear. Clear. Move it up.

103
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,780
Look what Mama did for you.

104
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,090
Holy shit. Uncle Sam gets
his. It's time to get ours.

105
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,090
Come on, kids, let's get paid.

106
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,520
- I guess you blew the right scumbag.
- I guess I did.

107
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,730
You're going to make
me sick. Let's go.

108
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,030
- Come on, Monster, let's go!
- On it, boss.

109
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,030
Neck! Bags, some rope!

110
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,100
- Yeah. Bags over here.
- Rope, bags!

111
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,670
- We've got three minutes.
- Rope!

112
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,140
Smoke, cut that shit!

113
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,710
Really? Really?

114
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,580
<i>Breacher, it's Watcher.
What's the delay?</i>

115
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,750
Well, we're cutting
through an obstacle, sir.

116
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,380
<i>- It's going to take a while.
- Roger that.</i>

117
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,580
Incoming.

118
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,520
<i>- Need any help?
- Negative. We have active shooters.</i>

119
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,730
<i>So just hold back
until it's all clear.</i>

120
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:40,460
Who wipes their ass and puts the toilet
paper on the outside of the fucking bowl?

121
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,700
Hey, get the water
line off the toilet.

122
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,600
- Hurry the fuck up!
- We're working on it.

123
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,170
- Today, Monster.
- Come on, hurry up, guys. Let's go.

124
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,800
- Incoming.
- Three, two...

125
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,140
Two mikes and we're through.

126
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,680
- Two minutes.
- Oh, God!

127
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,940
- What's taking you so fucking long?
- Go, go, go.

128
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,350
Let's go, I want more money.

129
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:02,180
- You're getting somewhere now.
- Here you go, babe.

130
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,090
Fuck!

131
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,560
- Fuck!
- What happened?

132
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,130
- Man down!
- Who's down?

133
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,970
- Smoke's been hit!
- God damn it! How'd that happen?

134
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,030
- <i>Smoke Jennings is down! Taking fire!
- Son of a bitch!</i>

135
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,000
Medical, stand by.
We may have a problem.

136
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,580
- Neck, render aid.
- I got it.

137
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,600
- Get his head down.
- <i>Get your man out of there.</i>

138
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,840
- Tripod, get in the rig!
- Stay with me.

139
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,180
- Got it!
- Monster, hurry up.

140
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,480
- Monster!
- Let's go. We need more money!

141
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,080
- Breacher, the dude's fucked up!
- Not getting paid ain't gonna help him.

142
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,930
Yeah? Now we're just like them!

143
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,620
- Shut your fucking mouth!
- This isn't what we fucking do!

144
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,720
I'll take your cut.

145
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,750
Shut the fuck up! Do your job!

146
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,460
Hang in there. Just a
little hickey, baby.

147
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,440
Keep the money coming!

148
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,690
Come on, Breacher.
Come on, come on, come on.

149
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,560
- One mike!
- Fuck, open your eyes!

150
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,560
- How's he doing?
- He's bleeding out.

151
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,200
- We gotta move him, boss!
- Get him out of here now. Get him up.

152
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,840
A little help, Grinder!

153
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,940
- <i>Breacher? Breacher, give me a sit rep.
- Stand by.</i>

154
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,040
I have men coming out.
Call up Medical.

155
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,680
<i>Are you in the money room?</i>

156
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,110
Let's go!

157
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,380
Come on, come on. Get
some more, get some more.

158
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,820
- Lizzy, how much money do we got?
- About $10 million.

159
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,650
- That's enough. Go and help Monster.
- On it!

160
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,750
- Okay, Tripod. Moving.
- <i>John.</i>

161
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,720
Come on, come on, come on.

162
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,160
Moving it in.

163
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,230
Last spark.

164
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,550
- Our man is out. Let's go.
- It's in. It's in.

165
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,630
- Go, go, go! Move!
- <i>God damn it, John! Talk to me.</i>

166
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:26,370
- We're through.
- All right, stack up.

167
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,500
Team, move.

168
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,930
Monster, stay left.
Heads on the swivel.

169
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,910
Coming out.

170
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,670
All right, who dropped ass?

171
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,870
Holy shit!

172
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,910
Fuck!

173
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,140
Stop splashing!

174
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,010
Here we go.

175
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,210
Come on, boys.

176
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,620
This better be worth it!

177
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,960
Fucking nasty.

178
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,120
Fuck.

179
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,990
- Shit.
- What?

180
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,190
Where's the fucking money?

181
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,900
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

182
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,300
- What?
- We should check in the water.

183
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,700
- What'd she say?
- Check in the water.

184
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,100
- The fucking money's gone.
- What the fuck you mean, check the water?

185
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,300
Right behind you.

186
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,170
What happened with the money?

187
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,340
What do you mean there's
no fucking money?

188
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,680
Look at the rope.

189
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,830
It's been cut.

190
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,210
Just check down there.
Check down here.

191
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,210
Oh, fucking shit.

192
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,780
- Who the fuck else knew about this shit?
- Come on.

193
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,220
It's not in the fucking water, man!
It's not in the fucking water!

194
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,100
- No fucking way!
- Who fucking cut the rope?

195
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,320
Why don't you all just shut
the fuck up and let's go?

196
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,400
Hold up, you guys. Hold up.

197
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,630
What the fuck is that?

198
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,650
Bullet.

199
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:08,040
We just wasted our whole fucking career
for this shit and there's nothing here?

200
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,770
- This ain't good. Let's walk.
- Check the water.

201
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,640
We sold ourselves out for this.

202
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,720
<i>We got a little problem.</i>

203
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,960
$10 million is missing.

204
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,360
Now listen. You all did
a fine job in there.

205
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,370
We're not arguing that you've
got a good record with the DEA.

206
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,330
None of that matters right now,

207
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:43,010
'cause all we need to do is find
out where that $10 million is.

208
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,770
And that's why you're here.

209
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,880
It was a big, giant
fucking stack of money.

210
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,240
How do you know, exactly down to the
dollar, how much was in that room?

211
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,750
Well, the FBI was

212
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,850
carrying on a parallel
investigation.

213
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,720
Did you ever see the $200 million?

214
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,950
Did you guys hear me
say I want my lawyer?

215
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,120
You know what would clear your
ass? If you'd take a polygraph.

216
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,660
- No poly.
- No poly?

217
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,360
That's weak. That's sad.

218
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,430
Your ass is going to prison.

219
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,870
When money is supposed to
be there and it goes away,

220
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,400
and it looks like to
us, it was a setup.

221
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,910
It may not be, and we're
going to find out.

222
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,040
And I know you had
a friend who died.

223
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,380
And that's awful, and it's
going to be more awful

224
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,840
if it was because of money.

225
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,310
My friend did not die for
fucking $10 million.

226
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,050
We lost a man, we lost a brother.

227
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,350
And you don't give
a shit about that.

228
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,720
It was Wharton's idea, wasn't it?

229
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,360
You were just following the
lead of a respected supervisor.

230
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,230
I mean, John is like your daddy.

231
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,030
You were doing what you had to do.

232
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,860
Fuck you. You don't know my daddy.

233
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,900
This agency saved your ass.
You were going nowhere.

234
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,000
You were a question
mark coming in here.

235
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,040
And you have been better
than any of us ever dreamed.

236
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,870
And you've always outperformed.

237
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,010
We're trying to save that career.

238
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,830
This is your family, Joe.
This is your family.

239
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,950
See, I'm not a thief.

240
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:06,820
If that cartel finds out
that you took $10 million,

241
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,460
they're going to slit your
throat from ear to ear.

242
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,740
I gotta pee, man.

243
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,350
- Say what?
- I gotta piss.

244
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,980
Then go pee.

245
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,920
Man, he got cameras all over.
There's no way I can go.

246
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,890
Oh, dude, really?

247
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:15,120
Piss, man. What the hell?
What you think?

248
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,440
I'm not going to stick my dick where
your dick been sticking in, man.

249
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,360
I ain't putting it in there.

250
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,500
Yeah, the problem is, your
shit probably fit in there.

251
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,270
My shit don't fit in there. I need a
thermos or some shit. Look at this.

252
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:27,170
- You threw a bottle of piss in my lap.
- Man, it's got a cap on it.

253
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,540
- Morning, Breach.
- Morning.

254
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,870
Hey, good morning.

255
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,040
Oh, man, thanks, Breach!

256
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,210
Breakfast of champions, huh?

257
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:37,050
Here's your DVD, man.
Appreciate it.

258
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,820
And don't piss in my
bushes anymore, okay?

259
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,520
I have a surveillance
camera. I see it all.

260
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,890
No, that was him.
I've got a bottle.

261
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,360
I'm not using that bottle.

262
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,060
I ain't sticking my dick nowhere
your dick has been, damn that.

263
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,530
You didn't say that about Rebecca.

264
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,360
When you fuck Rebecca?

265
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,060
- I fuck them all.
- Bro.

266
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,000
Just follow that truck.
I'm gonna deal with you.

267
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,250
So you think he did it?

268
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,920
I don't know if he did it. I just know
I hear stuff, that's all I'm saying.

269
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,620
They're looking for something.

270
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,690
But they haven't found anything, or else we
wouldn't be following him around like this.

271
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,330
Yeah.

272
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,540
Why don't you just
pull the pin on this?

273
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,410
You're never going to be able to
spend that blood money anyway.

274
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,210
Do it for your team.

275
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,710
Do it for your country.

276
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,180
Do it for yourself.

277
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,680
Retire. End it. End the pain.

278
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,020
Fuck you, Breacher.

279
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,700
I hate it as much as you do, sir.

280
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,010
Tactical god.

281
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,750
Why don't you wash
your fucking hands?

282
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,050
That's a new suit?

283
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,990
Why do you rock that off-the-rack,
cheap-ass JCPenney shit

284
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:38,990
when you can afford Armani? In fact, why
aren't you on a yacht in the Caymans?

285
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:43,060
I know what you're trying
to do. The jabs, the jokes.

286
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:46,600
But tell them I'm
not going to bite.

287
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,240
What'd you tell Smoke
Jennings' wife?

288
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,270
That he died for a good
cause, making you rich?

289
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,880
Tell them you let me disarm you.

290
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,310
Give me the fucking gun.

291
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,370
Come in.

292
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,040
Have a seat, John.

293
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,920
It's over.

294
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,190
I'll go and clean out my desk.

295
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,630
I'm not firing you.

296
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,700
The investigation is over.

297
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,260
No one's been exonerated.

298
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:52,770
DC just lost their appetite.

299
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:56,300
Who do you know in
Washington, John?

300
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:59,070
Got a picture of a senator
fucking a goat, maybe?

301
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:06,080
The only thing anyone in law
enforcement has is their credibility.

302
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,780
It's like virginity. Once
it's gone, it's gone forever.

303
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,420
When did you lose yours?

304
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,900
What if I gave you your team back?

305
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,600
Don't fuck with me.

306
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,100
No one wants you, John.

307
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,840
I've got nowhere else to stick you.

308
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,240
Mind showing some
leadership this time?

309
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,640
Gun.

310
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,310
Badge.

311
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,520
Creds.

312
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,180
There you go. You're
back in the game.

313
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,780
They don't fucking let us train.
They don't let us shoot.

314
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,840
I mean, I can't even carry a
fucking gun in here, dude.

315
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,710
We're sitting on our
asses, rotting.

316
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,520
It's punishment, bro.

317
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,420
Don't let it get in your head.

318
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,250
Just deal with it. I am.

319
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,750
- Who's winning?
- Get down.

320
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,660
Get the fuck out of the way!

321
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,660
- In the middle of my goddamn game!
- Fuck me!

322
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,590
Country-ass motherfucker!

323
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,260
- Why you acting all Jethro on that shit?
- You gonna play?

324
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,500
We're reduced to a fucking
rubber gun squad, bro,

325
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,330
I feel like a fucking parolee.

326
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,600
Why is he tattooing a
dick on your back, Pyro?

327
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,870
- You know what, bro, this is a fallen soldier.
- Fuck you, man.

328
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,510
Will you fucking dial it down?
I just lost a buddy down range!

329
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,780
Easy, easy, killer. Hell!

330
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,180
It does kind of look like a dick.

331
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,150
The expert has spoken.

332
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,720
Bro, if I turn around and see a fucking
dick in the mirror, you're dead.

333
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,490
It doesn't look like a dick.

334
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,660
- Get off my ass, man!
- You might wanna listen to this.

335
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:03,430
- It's a fucking piece of shit.
- Fuck you.

336
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,500
'Cause all the company she
keeps is rubbing off on her.

337
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,370
All the fucking
piece-of-shit-ness...

338
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,540
Man, you need a Xanax or something.

339
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,870
Why don't you go home and
fuck your mama again?

340
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,610
Come on, man.

341
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:18,410
You were slightly amusing in
the field. Here, you just suck.

342
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,720
I will out-fight, out-fuck

343
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,820
and out-work you on my worst day.

344
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,290
See, I don't wanna fuck you, Lizzy.
Crack whores are not my thing.

345
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,560
Hey! That's my wife, yeah?

346
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,930
Bro, you bought a fucking
cow when the milk was free.

347
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:35,300
Let's do it, pussy. Come
on, let's go bareback.

348
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,400
Wear a mouthpiece and
head guard if you want.

349
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,500
I'll still fucking dismantle you!

350
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,740
Okay, now I want to fuck her.

351
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:49,040
Out cold, bitch!

352
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,580
- She got you.
- Yo!

353
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,650
What the fuck is going on here?

354
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,590
This place looks like a
fucking crack house!

355
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:05,730
You shouldn't be here.
What are you doing here?

356
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,000
The investigation is over.

357
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,470
- We're back in business!
- No shit?

358
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,300
- Yes!
- Whoo!

359
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,670
- Here are your credentials.
- Fucking finally!

360
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,570
Whoo! Gimme!

361
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,570
- How'd you manage this, boss?
- Ain't that pretty?

362
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:21,040
I told you! I told
you motherfuckers!

363
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,680
- And you, put a shirt on.
- Here we go.

364
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,480
You're just jealous.

365
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,020
- Good to have you back, boss.
- Is that a dick?

366
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,350
Dude!

367
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:32,020
- It's a self-portrait!
- Where's the fucking mirror?

368
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,990
It's not done.

369
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,020
Let's go!

370
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,090
Morning, boss.

371
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,330
- Morning!
- Boss!

372
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,600
Morning, Daddy.

373
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,670
Good to be back.

374
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,640
What took you so fucking long?

375
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,470
I'm embarrassed you
don't have decent shit.

376
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,680
Who's got coffee?

377
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,780
Knock the dust off!

378
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,750
Are you fucking kidding me?

379
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,160
You promised you'd use the
down time to work on yourself.

380
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,730
I'm fine.

381
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,530
Give me the weapon.

382
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,730
No.

383
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,800
- I can train...
- Lizzy.

384
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,640
Breacher. I'm training.

385
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,410
Why don't you go play daddy
somewhere else, huh?

386
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,480
Come on.

387
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,820
Slow the fuck down!

388
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,520
Shut the fuck up!

389
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,990
- Hurry the fuck up!
- You're moving too fast.

390
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,560
- Sweetheart, shut up!
- So slow.

391
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,420
You need to skinny
up, motherfucker.

392
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,790
Get that chicken
wing out of the way.

393
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,060
Fucking get in your own lane.

394
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,500
Y'all seriously taking
giant-ass steps.

395
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,800
Give me room. Give me room!

396
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,600
Little room. Little room!

397
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,040
Contact right!

398
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,940
Hi! We're home!

399
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,440
Thank you!

400
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,640
Fuck, y'all didn't
even stutter, man!

401
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,840
Slowest fucking pie I've
ever seen in my life.

402
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,040
Whenever you're ready!

403
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,710
Come on, open the door, let's go!

404
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,710
Make a decision!

405
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,480
- All fucking day.
- Let me pie this fucking door.

406
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,930
If there's pussy in there,
you'd already be in there.

407
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,030
Dead.

408
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:13,990
It won't kick itself. Punch it!

409
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:16,290
Breaching the fucking door!

410
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,590
What the fuck are you doing?

411
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,660
- Seriously!
- Fuck you!

412
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,100
- First in the room?
- That's the way to wait for the team there.

413
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,930
- Very nice. Very nice.
- That's not how you fucking do it.

414
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,970
You going to get in my
fucking way every time?

415
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:30,140
All right, secure from exercise!

416
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,570
This one is down.

417
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,240
Yeah, I got him.

418
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,850
- What about him?
- Fuck!

419
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,820
And who is that? Somebody's
got to dig that fucking corner.

420
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,520
No shit!

421
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,850
- Yeah, second guy in the room.
- It was you!

422
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,120
- You got this guy.
- I was number three!

423
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,590
- That's your fucking corner!
- Be quiet.

424
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,490
- He's dead!
- I was third one through!

425
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:49,460
Guys, shut up!

426
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,690
- You should have dug the corner.
- Shut up. Shut up.

427
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,430
Grinder. You have to
take that corner.

428
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,760
You breached.

429
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:59,130
You immediately turn
and you go for it.

430
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,970
That's your responsibility,
and you cover that corner.

431
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,770
There's no argument here,
so let's run it again.

432
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,110
- Fucking asshole.
- Told you.

433
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,110
Come on, guys.

434
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,550
Fuck it! Why don't I
run it by myself?

435
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,980
I'll show you fuckers how to do it!

436
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,150
Oh, fuck off!

437
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:22,590
So what happened?
You used to be good at this.

438
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:26,460
Yeah, well, six months of finger
pointing and recrimination happened.

439
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,430
You weren't around.
You didn't have our backs.

440
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:32,000
- Well, not by choice.
- That's your fucking excuse?

441
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,670
When did you ever
listen to the rules?

442
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,510
We're not a team anymore.

443
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,510
Just a gang.

444
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,390
And there is no trust.
There is no trust.

445
00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:00,190
We're going to get it back. I know.

446
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,260
We're still a family.

447
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,300
Yeah, I wish I could believe you.

448
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:16,010
So now we don't trust each other?

449
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:18,840
In what we do, there is only trust.

450
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,280
I trust you!

451
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:25,250
Each and every one of you.

452
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:29,820
With my life.

453
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:33,890
And I'll prove it to you.
Kick the door.

454
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,330
Kill the bad guys. Don't kill me.

455
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,400
What the fuck did you say to him?

456
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,860
Target!

457
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,340
How did we do, boss?

458
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:27,050
Good. Good job.

459
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,850
I guess we don't suck.

460
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,190
It's time to do the Lord's work.

461
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,070
Shots! Beers! Come on!

462
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,550
All right, who's gonna
get this round?

463
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,600
I'll get the fucking round!

464
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,740
Why they call you Pyro, honey?

465
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,110
'Cause I hooked a
flashbang in a meth lab,

466
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,080
burned down the whole
fucking apartment building.

467
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,350
That's why we don't let him
have the bangs no more.

468
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,380
You about burned my
ass up, you bastard.

469
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,950
We call him Pyro
'cause his ass burns.

470
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:13,260
- Yeah, whatever, asshole.
- Get of here. Get out of here.

471
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,360
- I would hit that.
- Fuck yeah!

472
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,730
To Lizzy, my favorite evil bitch.

473
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,770
Evil bitch!

474
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,330
No, fuck that!

475
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,160
Let's drink to Smoke Jennings.

476
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,140
That motherfucker
died for our sins.

477
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,240
Fuck yeah.

478
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,380
- Smoke Jennings!
- Smoke!

479
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,810
- Smoke!
- Smoke!

480
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,280
- Yeah!
- Smoke!

481
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,980
This is one for the homie
that can't be here.

482
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,750
Smoke Jennings.

483
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,000
You know, we missed you.

484
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:54,330
You're the heart and soul of us.

485
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,870
Don't ever forget that.

486
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:00,510
They almost won.

487
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,980
It's fucking bullshit
and you know it.

488
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,050
We're here, aren't we?

489
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,850
We held out

490
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:13,420
as a team.

491
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:20,730
It's just that, that
thing that we did

492
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,600
was for nothing.

493
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,700
Let it go.

494
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,940
You hear me?

495
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,170
Let it go.

496
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,440
Okay.

497
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,850
You know what? I can do this
shit better than all y'all.

498
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,190
Get the fuck off the stage!

499
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,320
Get the fuck off the stage!

500
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,930
Relax!

501
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:53,460
Let's go, motherfucker!

502
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,130
Get the fuck back!

503
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,720
Good night, motherfucker.

504
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,500
All right, let's go.
We gotta roll, we gotta roll!

505
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,510
Whoo!

506
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,920
Sorry about your bouncer, man!

507
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,440
- Have a nice night!
- Thanks for the lap dance!

508
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,460
Fuck!

509
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,170
What the fuck?

510
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,280
What the fuck?

511
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:19,810
No! What the fuck?

512
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:23,550
Fuck! Fuck!

513
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,060
Miss.

514
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,920
Hi.

515
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,990
Tom worked for me.

516
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,160
John Wharton.

517
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,930
Caroline Brentwood. Homicide.

518
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,600
Can you help me with next of kin?

519
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,240
There's some ex-wives.

520
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:55,010
So, what happened here?

521
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:57,110
Train versus Winnebago.

522
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,550
Train won.

523
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,350
So why is Homicide involved?

524
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:04,380
Well, some sucker's got to
write it up. Guess that's me.

525
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,690
Anything else I can do?

526
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,890
Start sweeping for body parts.

527
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,630
Caroline, hey, I found the torso.

528
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:19,130
Coming to you!

529
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,070
Oh, geez.

530
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,810
Look at this.

531
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:33,380
You can smell the
alcohol from here.

532
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,980
Yeah, right.

533
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,490
Your man's been drinking.

534
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,360
We did have a team celebration.

535
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,200
As soon as I get this
place locked down,

536
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,770
I need a statement from you.

537
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,640
You know who that is, right?

538
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,280
Some Fed who thinks
his shit don't stink.

539
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,350
That's John Wharton.

540
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,820
He's a drug war god.

541
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:14,720
What... He looks a
little down, Darius.

542
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,190
Why don't you go suck his dick?

543
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,190
That ain't right.

544
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:22,330
- Well, you're making cow eyes at him.
- That ain't right.

545
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:53,290
- Stripper's here!
- Whoo! Ooh, yeah!

546
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:55,560
Aren't you a little
old for this shit?

547
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,960
Investigator Caroline Brentwood.

548
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,410
I'm looking for Eddie Jordan.

549
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,040
- Neck!
- Yo!

550
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,370
I brought you a present.

551
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,940
Oh, shit.

552
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,480
Look at the water.

553
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,820
No, thank you.

554
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:19,220
Have a fucking drink for my
friend. We buried him today.

555
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,790
That's why I'm here. You
wanna go somewhere private?

556
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,790
Private?

557
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:26,360
Fuck that. This is family time.

558
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,330
You just get the fuck over here

559
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:31,100
and make it clap for Uncle Daddy.

560
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,370
Look at you, got the
whole FBI get-up.

561
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,240
You got your badge.

562
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,840
You dumb fuck, that's
the lead investigator

563
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,640
in Pyro's accident. Am I right?

564
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,310
It's a fucking stripper!

565
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,710
She's not the stripper.

566
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,480
She's an APD investigator.

567
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,450
- Damn.
- We'd welcome you.

568
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,750
But I just want to know what the
fuck you doing here right now.

569
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,120
Well, I'm sorry to
rain on your bro-down.

570
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,220
I just need to get
a quick statement.

571
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:59,460
- Neck, lawyer the fuck up! Don't say shit!
- You know it, Sugar!

572
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,200
Neck hates cops because
the Columbian police

573
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,400
beat the living shit out of
him for not paying a tranny.

574
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,870
Dude, you fucking gotta bring
that up every fucking time!

575
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:10,100
I got worse PTSD
from a dude in heels

576
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,240
than anything I got in
that fucking place.

577
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,310
I'll strip for you, honey bear.

578
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,840
Get her, Grinder.

579
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,470
I'm good, thank you.

580
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:24,350
Pull your fucking panties out of your
ass, sweetheart, and take the beer.

581
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,350
It's a party.

582
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,190
Well, since you put it like that.

583
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,600
I like the way you play.
Now lick it off.

584
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,570
One step closer, I rip
your fucking balls off.

585
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,640
- Whoo!
- Get her, baby bird! Get her!

586
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,200
- Hey! Shut the fuck up!
- Boss, come on!

587
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:46,170
Come on, settle down, shut up.

588
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:50,080
This is my fucking house,
okay? She's a guest!

589
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,880
- Guest, my ass.
- Come on. Let's go inside.

590
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,180
- Hit that, Breach, get some!
- Investigate the shit out of that.

591
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:00,320
- Whose round it is?
- Pyro's!

592
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:05,860
I've been chasing your man three
days for a five-minute interview.

593
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,060
Can you do something about that?

594
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,300
You some kind of a big deal?

595
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,470
Yeah. I've been around.

596
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:20,040
I speak to him tomorrow,
or I go over your head.

597
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:22,780
I will make it happen.

598
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,010
Your friend's here.

599
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:33,050
I wouldn't bother. Tips are lousy.

600
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:37,390
Liquor store's cleared by arrest.

601
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,830
- We present to Nichols on Tuesday.
- No.

602
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,330
Suspect has taken a plea.

603
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:43,660
- Who says?
- Nichols' office.

604
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:46,030
Funny how they do that
when they're on video.

605
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:46,700
Mmm-hmm.

606
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:50,470
Train versus RV.
It's ruled accidental,

607
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,940
so I'm thinking this
is not our problem.

608
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,810
I just have one interview to do
on that. I'll knock it out tonight.

609
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:58,910
It's accidental. Who cares?

610
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:02,550
Right, so no one should interview
the last guy who saw him alive?

611
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,220
Perfectionist.

612
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,560
Breacher. Gotta go.

613
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,460
Breacher. Damn.

614
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:15,330
He's sexting me.

615
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:17,800
- All right, man, just go. Go ahead.
- Want to see?

616
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,230
- Get out of my face with that, man.
- He's a natural blond, you know.

617
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,770
- Get out of my face.
- Oh, yeah.

618
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:24,500
I don't want to hear
nothing about that.

619
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,310
You are dirty.

620
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:28,070
Jezebel.

621
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,650
I've known some cops in my time, but
your people don't seem like cops.

622
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:39,280
Good. They're the best
undercover agents in the DEA.

623
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:42,260
Work hard, play hard, right?

624
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:45,330
Look who's talking.

625
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:47,630
You enjoy your cups.

626
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:49,560
Why do you say that?

627
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,400
Your skin.

628
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,300
Wow.

629
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,400
Just...

630
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,570
Wow.

631
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,210
Wow.

632
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,150
Neck!

633
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,190
It's me!

634
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,630
Shit, no light.

635
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,660
Come on.

636
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:26,870
You don't need that.

637
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:29,130
I'm a cautious girl.

638
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,140
Neck!

639
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:34,040
Wake up, you drunk fuck!

640
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:45,620
You got right. Move.

641
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,360
Clear.

642
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,660
Clear.

643
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,470
Sorry.

644
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:10,180
Let me clear this.

645
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,810
Move.

646
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:21,170
- Clear.
- Okay.

647
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,430
Where the fuck is he?

648
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,200
Oh, fuck!

649
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,950
Would you help me up, please?

650
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:50,850
Can you help me up, please?

651
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,790
Thank you very much.

652
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,760
Well, we found him.

653
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,810
You smoke?

654
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:23,450
Only when I find my witnesses
nailed to the ceiling.

655
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:25,450
Right. I'm gonna leave.

656
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:27,790
No, you're not.
You're not fucking leaving!

657
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,590
You're in this now.

658
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:31,530
What are you talking about?

659
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,430
I'm a Fed.

660
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,360
See you.

661
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,230
You're an asshole.

662
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,840
All right, let's cut him down.

663
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:54,580
From a preliminary investigation,
I have a cause of death.

664
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,580
Massive hemothorax.

665
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,020
From a right ventricular
stab wound.

666
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,220
- This, where my finger is...
- Uh-huh.

667
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,860
That's how far the knife
went inside his chest.

668
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,960
- Okay.
- And they gutted him like a pig.

669
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:09,860
Hey, Doc, this guy's a trained guy.

670
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,870
Who could walk up on a
trained guy like that?

671
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:14,130
Somebody that had better
skills than he had.

672
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,640
He knew exactly where
he was stabbing.

673
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,140
Boo-yah! Got some hairs.
Not the victim's.

674
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,680
- Show me.
- Right here.

675
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,010
And here's some more. Here.

676
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,640
- Can you bag those?
- Sure.

677
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:26,850
I'll take them to the lab myself.

678
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,720
Okay.

679
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,720
- Thanks, guys.
- Sure.

680
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,250
- Thanks.
- You got it.

681
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:40,660
You know, in Northern Ireland, the IRA
nailed snitches to the kitchen floor.

682
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,100
How do you know shit like that?

683
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,900
Some research I was doing.

684
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:47,070
Okay, so you put out a BOLO
for Lucky Charms guy.

685
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:51,240
Hey, take a criminalist
and sweep the RV's cab.

686
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,840
For what? What am I looking for?

687
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,770
Linkage.

688
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,650
They're dead and we're not.
What are we doing?

689
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,690
We D-up and present a hard target.

690
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:13,090
Like taking showers
with full body armor.

691
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,700
Well, we need fucking intel.

692
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,860
- Who'd they send up?
- Well, who do you think, sweetheart?

693
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:19,000
Check the board!

694
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,540
Could be Soto! Could
be fucking Romero!

695
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,970
It could be fucking... They could
be... They may be... Fucking...

696
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:26,610
Any of this a surprise to you?

697
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,810
Just let it go, huh?

698
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:30,020
Surprise to you, Sugar?

699
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,570
I don't really know what
you're talking about.

700
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:37,250
Guess I'm the only one with
any fucking balls here.

701
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:40,590
It's the goddamn money.

702
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:44,460
- Just let it go, all right?
- No!

703
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:47,230
We had to go fingering
the devil's pussy.

704
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:50,330
It's an occupational hazard
when you fight the cartels.

705
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:51,930
Oh, really?

706
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:53,900
You see any other
Feds getting smoked?

707
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,670
- It could happen to anyone.
- Bullshit!

708
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:59,240
You believe that, chief?

709
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:03,180
Or is that just some shit you're
spitting in case this place is bugged?

710
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:06,950
Always assume that
someone is listening.

711
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,850
So shut the fuck up.

712
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:17,760
I ain't gonna fight you, boss.

713
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:36,370
Where the fuck are you going?

714
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,140
Out.

715
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:42,080
I'm bored.

716
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,410
You're not going out.

717
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:45,780
It's not safe.

718
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,780
They're hunting us.

719
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:50,350
I can take care of myself.

720
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:51,610
- Give me that fucking...
- No!

721
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:55,150
Give that back to me. Give
that back to me! Monster!

722
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,160
What's this, huh?

723
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,160
Is this chewing gum?

724
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,990
- Huh?
- Yeah.

725
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:02,030
What the fuck you need this for?

726
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:04,000
What the fuck do you need this for?

727
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:07,500
- Get out of my way.
- No, Lizzy.

728
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:17,940
It's the stripper.

729
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:19,250
Can we talk inside?

730
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:21,390
What the fuck do you want?

731
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,820
Just some background
information on your unit.

732
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:27,690
So I can develop some suspects.

733
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:34,290
You know what we do, right?

734
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,860
This special operations team?

735
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:41,400
Well, to be honest, I have no
idea. Why don't you tell me?

736
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,540
We covertly

737
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,940
penetrate

738
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:49,410
drug organizations.

739
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:52,150
I guess that would make
you some enemies, huh?

740
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:53,950
Any one come to mind?

741
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:55,350
Any particular guy

742
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:59,490
that might nail Special
Agent Jordan to a ceiling?

743
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:01,390
Are you really this stupid?

744
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:04,820
Ma'am, I'm not your friend,
and I'm not your colleague.

745
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:08,830
So don't bully me. Or I'll slap
you with a 48-hour jail hold.

746
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:09,900
And by the looks of things,

747
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,430
you can't hack a day without your
favorite controlled substance.

748
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:14,030
So let's keep it nice, shall we?

749
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:16,200
And yes, assume I'm stupid.

750
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,500
Paint me a picture.

751
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,610
Please.

752
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:30,480
I took these in Juarez.

753
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,550
They're friends of mine.

754
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,850
And this is what the
Rios-Garza cartel does

755
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:37,620
to indicate that you've
pissed them off.

756
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:43,900
Sweetheart, you're so in
over your fucking head.

757
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:47,270
You need more than a Glock
and sensible shoes.

758
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:48,770
Walk away.

759
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,340
Walk away.

760
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:59,350
I'll show myself out.
Thank you for your time.

761
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:01,580
It's our pleasure.

762
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,490
We're gonna have to each get two
jobs just to put him through school.

763
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:07,220
Have you considered prostitution?

764
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:09,410
- Hey, what's up?
- More black hairs.

765
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:11,460
And look.

766
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:14,090
A beautiful thumbprint we got off
the steering column of the RV.

767
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:17,130
- It's not the vic's.
- Boo-yah! Linkage.

768
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,430
You just said "boo-yah."

769
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:22,700
That's my thing.
Don't jack my thing.

770
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,270
I heard the lab tech say it.

771
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:28,880
I didn't hear it.

772
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,210
Bullshit, you heard it.

773
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:32,640
Well, if she said it,
she got it from me.

774
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:37,550
Due to the staging of Special
Agent Jordan's body,

775
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:40,490
we believe there's a connection
to the Rios-Garza cartel.

776
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:43,590
DTO. Rios-Garza Drug
Trafficking Organization.

777
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:46,560
We don't use the term "cartel."

778
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:48,260
Thank you, sir.

779
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:51,560
It seems that Special Agent
Roberts' death was not an accident.

780
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:53,870
We have recovered physical evidence
linking the two crime scenes.

781
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:57,070
I would like to have a copy of those files,
if you could make those available for me.

782
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:59,610
- Yes, sir.
- Today, would that be all right?

783
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:02,080
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

784
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,610
Investigator Brentwood, what
exactly do you want from us?

785
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:07,580
Well, learning about the victims
helps me find the suspects.

786
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:11,050
Maybe these murders are blowback
from cases they worked on.

787
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:13,350
You want access to DEA case files?

788
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,690
It would help.

789
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:17,960
Are you asking for investigatory
support or access to our records?

790
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,630
Both. Look, maybe there's someone

791
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:21,960
- I can liaise with, someone who...
- Investigator Brentwood...

792
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,000
your agency needs to draft a formal
letter requesting assistance.

793
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,100
Any documents you want access to
will need to be specifically cited.

794
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,140
Specifically cited. What
information do you need?

795
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:32,970
Incident report numbers.
File numbers.

796
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,380
Right. And how are we going
to know those numbers

797
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,310
if we don't know those numbers?

798
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:41,210
If you don't know really what you
want, what are you doing here?

799
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:45,150
Two murders of DEA agents
have happened on my watch.

800
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:49,160
And it's my job to investigate them,
and I'm asking for your help.

801
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:52,620
Just have the chief fire off a letter,
and we'll see what we can do.

802
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:55,360
Thank you for coming in.

803
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,300
Have a nice day, y'all.

804
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:01,670
Fucking US Attorney and their own
general counsel? These guys are scared.

805
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:04,440
Hey. You're Brentwood,
you're Jackson, right?

806
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,580
Yeah.

807
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:08,310
- You working the agent nailed to the ceiling?
- What do you know about that?

808
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:10,440
The DEA is a dysfunctional
family, all right?

809
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,410
No one's going to talk
family business with you.

810
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:13,650
Who are you? Got a card?

811
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:18,750
Ask yourself why it happened. Everything
happens for a reason. Think about that.

812
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,460
Stop leaving your shit on my seat.

813
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:27,130
That's not mine.

814
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:29,230
It's not some porn you're
hiding from your wife?

815
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,000
That's not mine.

816
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,600
It's not mine.

817
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,170
<i>You're out here saving
these adrenaline junkies</i>

818
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:39,240
<i>that mean absolutely nothing
to this department.</i>

819
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,970
<i>I would take a bullet
for these guys.</i>

820
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:43,480
<i>Hmm. You'd take a bullet.
Would you take 10 million bucks?</i>

821
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,780
<i>Would you take $10 million?
Where's the money?</i>

822
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:48,310
<i>Don't fucking scream at me!</i>

823
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:50,250
<i>- Where's the money?
- You dumb fuck, you!</i>

824
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:56,120
<i>Look at you! With your fucking 48% body fat.
And, you, scrawny little bastard!</i>

825
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,660
<i>- Fuck you guys!
- <i>Go to the gym, John.</i></i>

826
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:01,460
Fucking liar. Fucking liar!

827
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,030
He's a fucking liar.

828
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:06,070
What? Caroline, where are you going?

829
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:12,300
Why the fuck didn't you tell me

830
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:16,580
you were under investigation for
stealing from the Rios-Garza cartel?

831
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,310
Get in.

832
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:20,210
I need a drink.

833
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,700
I need you to be
straight with me, John.

834
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,640
No, you be straight with me.

835
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,610
Why do I have to find out
through the grapevine

836
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:48,240
that you linked the
deaths of my people?

837
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,780
They're linked, I'm sorry. My turn.

838
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:51,340
Did you steal the money?

839
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:53,110
No.

840
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,150
- And fuck you for asking.
- Don't be such a girl.

841
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:58,480
Your agency thinks you did.
So does the Rios-Garza cartel.

842
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,650
Why do you think they're
killing your guys?

843
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:03,490
Spend enough time on the
job, the job bites back.

844
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:05,860
That's bullshit.

845
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:10,160
You going somewhere?

846
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,670
One of my guys quit the
team. He's off the grid.

847
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:14,800
I gotta warn him.

848
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,970
Okay, grab your stuff
and I'll drive.

849
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:23,310
<i>They're going to continue
to fucking kill people,</i>

850
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:27,710
<i>and kill fucking innocent people and women
and children in Mexico and the United States</i>

851
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:29,520
<i>- unless you have guys like me!
- <i>Son!</i></i>

852
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,720
<i>- That's a fact.
<i>- Son!</i></i>

853
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,320
<i>Motherfucker, I quit.</i>

854
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:41,260
Last fall, an 8-year-old
girl vanished from her bed.

855
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:47,170
No leads. Only her daddy's...
bullshit about hearing black voices.

856
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:52,440
And he's a drinker. Joins AA
the week after she disappears.

857
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:56,140
He profiles, too.
Domestic abuser, all that.

858
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,540
And I can't find enough
for the DA to file.

859
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,900
Do you see where this is going?

860
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:03,340
Just because you're not in jail
doesn't mean you didn't do it.

861
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:05,650
You're awesome on a road
trip, you know that?

862
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:08,820
Yeah, I've heard that before.

863
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:25,570
That's it, right there.

864
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:33,780
It's beautiful.

865
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:36,010
Watch out for booby traps.

866
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,150
Bullshit.

867
00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:41,290
I'm serious.

868
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:43,690
This could take your leg right off.

869
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:46,220
Here's the trip wire.

870
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:52,370
Why is he so paranoid?

871
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:55,070
Maybe he doesn't want to
get nailed to a ceiling.

872
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,510
Tripod!

873
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,990
McNeely?

874
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:20,930
It's John!

875
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:36,510
There's something off.

876
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:13,540
Fuck.

877
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:19,280
Unit 2150.

878
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:24,120
Send me two units and
an ME to my location.

879
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:55,050
AK brass.

880
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:00,520
The guy hit the trip wire.

881
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:02,790
Right there.

882
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:13,360
Looks like he bled out.

883
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:18,700
Here, hold this.

884
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:27,510
What's that?

885
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:29,820
They're world-class assholes.

886
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:34,550
Give me the weapon.
I don't trust you.

887
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:37,490
Well, you know, it was
getting heavy anyway.

888
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,600
Hey!

889
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,340
How you feeling?

890
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:58,780
I'm sorry?

891
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:02,150
Well, now that you got
sucked into our world.

892
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:08,650
They're Kaibiles.

893
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:10,620
Kaibiles?

894
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:12,660
Guatemalan Special Forces.

895
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:13,950
Okay.

896
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:18,190
Rios-Garza Organization loves to
use them for high-power hits.

897
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:24,470
You know, McNeely was
a fucking Navy SEAL.

898
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:31,180
He was 10 times the
operator that I'll ever be.

899
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,750
What chance do you think I got?

900
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:42,660
See, they're the best
assassins that money can buy.

901
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:44,960
Honey, I worked gangs
for eight years.

902
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,460
Streets have rules, okay? You steal
money, doesn't matter who you are,

903
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:53,030
you can be a cop, you could
be God, they will get you.

904
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:55,570
I came here to help you.

905
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:57,540
- No, you did not.
- To help you understand.

906
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:01,070
You came here 'cause you think you're gonna
be next. You came here to steer me, okay?

907
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:04,110
If you want to help me, and if you
don't want to get nailed to a ceiling

908
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:08,610
or run over by a train, you need
to break free from your buddies

909
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:11,780
and tell me something I don't
know about John Wharton.

910
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:14,920
Because I can't read him.
Tell me something I don't know.

911
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:22,830
Two years ago,

912
00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:25,830
<i>we arrested Edgar Rios in Juarez.</i>

913
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:29,400
<i>He was an old-school drug lord,
ran all their operations.</i>

914
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:40,410
<i>It was a big deal.</i>

915
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:56,930
<i>We're handing him
over to the Mexicans</i>

916
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:01,700
<i>when some broad pulls
her shit and dumps him.</i>

917
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:08,770
<i>Cartel didn't want him
debriefed by our intel people.</i>

918
01:00:11,810 --> 01:00:13,910
<i>Problem solved.</i>

919
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:23,990
<i>But they had a bigger problem.</i>

920
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:28,830
<i>They wanted the man who can get
the man that nobody can get.</i>

921
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:38,200
<i>John gets a call</i>

922
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,270
<i>from the bad guys.</i>

923
01:00:42,210 --> 01:00:46,740
<i>They snatched his wife and kid right
out of his house on Lake Lanier.</i>

924
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,880
<i>They're holding them in Juarez.</i>

925
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:53,220
<i>They make him an offer.</i>

926
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:57,760
<i>"Surrender yourself to the
cartel and your family lives."</i>

927
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,560
<i>John's family is everything.</i>

928
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:03,290
<i>John was married forever.</i>

929
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:06,970
<i>His son Jacob was his best friend.</i>

930
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:08,830
Love you, Dad.

931
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:14,610
<i>They tortured Karen
and Jacob to death.</i>

932
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:17,040
<i>There's video. Evil shit.</i>

933
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,100
<i>No! No! No!</i>

934
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:23,680
<i>They mailed pieces of them
to his home for weeks.</i>

935
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,380
<i>Oh, my God! Oh, my God!</i>

936
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:33,360
<i>So John went down there. Alone.</i>

937
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:37,430
<i>Hunting the man who
killed his wife.</i>

938
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:40,030
John, we're coming in!

939
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,480
<i>He didn't find him.</i>

940
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:56,680
We're here to bring you back home.

941
01:01:58,350 --> 01:02:01,450
This isn't going to
bring them back.

942
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:21,800
Come on. Let's go home.

943
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:27,480
<i>John is obsessed with
finding his wife's killer.</i>

944
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:33,020
<i>It's like a cancer in his soul.</i>

945
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:43,460
Caroline, we lost
John when they died.

946
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:50,070
Go home.

947
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,940
Go home now.

948
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,680
I was just trying to help.

949
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:12,820
I'm sorry.

950
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:15,660
I'm so sorry.

951
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:23,370
John.

952
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:27,500
Wait up. I didn't know about your
family. John, I'm sorry, I...

953
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,510
Now you know.

954
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:34,180
They sent me her face.

955
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,450
I'm sorry.

956
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:44,090
I'm sorry.

957
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:03,210
So this isn't creepy.

958
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:06,040
Someone else get killed?

959
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:08,880
I brought a peace offering.

960
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,390
Let me show you something.

961
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:27,000
Your shooters. They're
Guatemalan Special Forces.

962
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,800
They came in through
Juarez with stolen visas.

963
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,470
ICE alerted, ran surveillance.

964
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:34,410
But lost them outside of Atlanta.

965
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:36,310
Now, you said you had prints.

966
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:39,910
Yeah. We got one at the RV,

967
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:41,810
and one outside McNeely's cabin.

968
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:44,150
But no NCIC hits.

969
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:46,650
See if these match.

970
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,690
Pretty please.

971
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:03,630
ICE took them off some beer
cans inside their hotel room.

972
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:07,000
Should I have these?

973
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:09,170
No.

974
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:13,710
Then why'd you give them to me?

975
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:17,150
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

976
01:05:33,170 --> 01:05:35,600
Holy shit.

977
01:05:38,070 --> 01:05:41,240
No way.

978
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:44,480
Don't say a word.

979
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:45,940
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

980
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:48,610
What happened to
"I'll never date a cop"?

981
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:51,250
Who said anything about a date?

982
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:53,280
Evil harlot.

983
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:55,450
I can't believe you said that.

984
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:57,650
You dirty, dirty girl.

985
01:05:58,290 --> 01:06:00,190
So I got a present for you.

986
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:02,590
Check that out.

987
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:05,320
Oh!

988
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:07,230
Bad guys.

989
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:09,570
- Dude looks like Mario from <i>Donkey Kong.
- Mmm-hmm.</i>

990
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:12,170
Who's the metrosexual
with the... You've got...

991
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:15,170
Prints, records, everything.

992
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:16,580
Did he leave it on
your night stand?

993
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:18,140
You don't want to know.

994
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:20,150
Shit.

995
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:22,950
Get in the car. You all right?
'Cause you walking funny.

996
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:25,020
You're just jealous.

997
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:28,220
Is he a big dude?

998
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:31,020
Like... like, is he big?

999
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:32,560
That's inappropriate.

1000
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:34,560
- Was it good?
- Shut up. Shut up.

1001
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:37,100
- Is he ripped, like a six-pack?
- Shut up.

1002
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:39,300
Just wondering. 'Cause
he's, like, a legend.

1003
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:40,670
You're good to go.

1004
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:43,370
It's a match.

1005
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:47,370
- Thank you, Tish.
- Okay, I'm going to write out a warrant-affidavit.

1006
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:49,710
You put out a BOLO,
armed and dangerous.

1007
01:06:49,710 --> 01:06:51,440
Yeah, and what you
gonna tell the judge?

1008
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,550
That we got slipped some
Secret Squirrel ICE file?

1009
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:55,060
That's exactly what I'm
going to tell him.

1010
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:57,380
Once they're in custody, we can get
as many print cards as we want.

1011
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:00,650
Doesn't matter how we get there,
as long as we get there.

1012
01:07:01,290 --> 01:07:03,790
Do we know where they are?

1013
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,260
Negative.

1014
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:09,160
So we still got no target?

1015
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:11,020
What the hell are we
doing sitting here?

1016
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:14,070
We could be drinking beers, throwing
dollars at something naked.

1017
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:17,670
- We're standing by.
- For what?

1018
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:21,540
Apparently, the boss got that
investigator lady working for us now.

1019
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:24,410
- Ain't that right, boss?
- Is that true?

1020
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,380
Hey. Grab a vest.

1021
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:30,540
What's up, partner?

1022
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:33,990
That ICE file your boyfriend
gave you had a credit card.

1023
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:37,620
I linked it to a cell phone. That cell
phone is live in an apartment building.

1024
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,620
That apartment building,
Narco knows about it.

1025
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:41,690
It's a Rios-Garza safe house.

1026
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:44,330
Okay, enough energy
drinks, partner.

1027
01:07:44,330 --> 01:07:48,500
While you've been saving
mankind, I drafted an affidavit.

1028
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:52,200
I sent it to the clerk, judge signed it.
You'll be needing that.

1029
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,670
- Yes, you're right. I need that.
- Okay.

1030
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:56,070
- You're right. I'm sorry. I was excited.
- Try and arrest him without it, huh?

1031
01:07:56,070 --> 01:07:59,410
I got excited about it, but we
gotta go kick some doors, baby.

1032
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:23,240
Multi-level residential.
Four units.

1033
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:26,170
Brick and masonry. Fortified
with barred windows.

1034
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:30,610
Steel security doors. You got an
iron fence around three sides.

1035
01:08:30,610 --> 01:08:32,480
All right, what's the plan, boss?

1036
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,080
<i>We blue angel up the back.</i>

1037
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:37,050
Single point dynamic entry.
Explosive breach.

1038
01:08:37,050 --> 01:08:39,990
We don't know what unit they're in,
so we clear the whole structure.

1039
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:43,020
All right, let's smoke these motherfuckers
and get us some dinner then.

1040
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:44,690
Two mikes out.

1041
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:46,530
<i>Two out, copy.</i>

1042
01:08:46,530 --> 01:08:48,790
We're at the railroad tracks.

1043
01:08:48,790 --> 01:08:50,230
Here we go, stand by.

1044
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:51,400
<i>Roger that.</i>

1045
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:54,530
We're not here to
make arrests, right?

1046
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:15,790
Breach!

1047
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:25,460
They killed two federal agents already.
They're not fucking around!

1048
01:09:25,470 --> 01:09:28,170
No matter what, we all go home
tonight at the end of this mission.

1049
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:37,440
You know what you're
doing with that thing?

1050
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:38,780
I was in the Army.

1051
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:41,110
- It's the wrong way up.
- It's not the wrong way up.

1052
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:43,620
You got to rack it all
the way back. Come on.

1053
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:45,920
I know how to rack a gun.

1054
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:52,960
Heading right.

1055
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:55,560
Keep your hands up.
Let me see your hands.

1056
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,460
Stay right there.

1057
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:59,320
Stay on the bed, kid.

1058
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:02,170
Shitty closet! Clear!

1059
01:10:02,170 --> 01:10:04,400
- Clear!
- Good! Let's go!

1060
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,700
Ready to go!

1061
01:10:08,210 --> 01:10:09,840
Don't stop!

1062
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,310
- Going left!
- Right!

1063
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:14,580
- Got your back.
- Got a bathroom! Clear!

1064
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:16,880
- All clear!
- Clear.

1065
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,550
- We're all set, boss!
- Keep moving!

1066
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:20,850
Stay tight!

1067
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:28,890
- One on the couch!
- I got left.

1068
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:31,640
- Put your hands up!
- Going left, boss!

1069
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,500
- Closet, clear!
- Let me see your hands!

1070
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:36,230
- Anyone else in here?
- Coming around.

1071
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:37,870
- Anyone else in here?
- Just my kids.

1072
01:10:37,870 --> 01:10:39,910
Kids in the back!

1073
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:41,270
- There are kids.
- Door!

1074
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:43,440
- Stay right where you are!
- Just keep them up.

1075
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,140
I got high. Get low!

1076
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:47,510
- Don't move.
- Clear.

1077
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:49,450
Checking for mice.

1078
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:50,550
Clear!

1079
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:51,880
We're clear!

1080
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:53,420
Moving.

1081
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:55,190
Just stay on the bed.

1082
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:56,960
Stay on the bed.

1083
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,500
- We're clear!
- Keep moving.

1084
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:02,800
Stack up!

1085
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,430
Okay. Ready?

1086
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:06,960
Yup. Door.

1087
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:18,640
- You get him!
- Go, go, go. Let's roll.

1088
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,610
Okay, move it!

1089
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:22,680
Fuck!

1090
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,580
We're tight, pop it!

1091
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,520
Asshole down!

1092
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:38,960
We're clear!

1093
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:50,910
Fuck!

1094
01:11:51,010 --> 01:11:52,720
Go! Go! Go!

1095
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:56,280
- Target down.
- Move! Move! Move!

1096
01:12:06,490 --> 01:12:08,290
Clear!

1097
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:16,640
Clear!

1098
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,440
Clear!

1099
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:20,370
Sugar, let's go.

1100
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:28,750
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!
<i>Calmate! Easy! Easy!</i>

1101
01:12:30,050 --> 01:12:31,750
- Good kill, baby.
- Come on!

1102
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:32,680
- I got the hostage.
- Clear!

1103
01:12:32,690 --> 01:12:34,450
Going right!

1104
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:36,350
- Clear!
- Clear!

1105
01:12:38,290 --> 01:12:39,520
- We're clear!
- Clear!

1106
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:42,890
Good fucking gunfight! God damn!

1107
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,930
- Hello.
- Hey, boss!

1108
01:12:44,930 --> 01:12:46,930
You might want to get in here!

1109
01:12:46,930 --> 01:12:49,030
What?

1110
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:51,600
Ta-da!

1111
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,710
You got your kit, babe?

1112
01:12:53,710 --> 01:12:56,610
Right, we're secure.
I'm gonna ID these guys.

1113
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:58,680
So which asshole are you?

1114
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,580
Lizzy, don't fucking do that!

1115
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:03,480
Liquid meth! Hell yeah!

1116
01:13:04,650 --> 01:13:07,350
You're one fucked up bitch!

1117
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:09,490
Yeah, it's meth.

1118
01:13:09,490 --> 01:13:12,290
- This is one for the books.
- Breach.

1119
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,240
- It's not them.
- It's not the Kaibiles?

1120
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:16,740
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

1121
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:18,730
You mean we killed six
motherfuckers and it ain't them?

1122
01:13:18,730 --> 01:13:20,370
Well, check again!

1123
01:13:20,370 --> 01:13:22,230
Okay.

1124
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,700
No! Still not them!

1125
01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:28,070
Dead man walking! Fuck me!

1126
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:30,070
Fucking shit.

1127
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,220
- Stay tight.
- Behind you, brother.

1128
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,850
All right, it's clear.

1129
01:14:16,890 --> 01:14:18,620
Get EMS in here.

1130
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:20,690
There's a lot of bodies.

1131
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:23,330
What the fuck are you doing here?

1132
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:25,830
It's my job.

1133
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:28,200
You used me.

1134
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:35,470
Breacher, God damn it!
What the fuck is going on here?

1135
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:38,310
Clean up, aisle three.

1136
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,980
God almighty!

1137
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:43,010
- What's wrong?
- Son of a bitch is snagged!

1138
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,620
Gimme a knife. I'm gonna
cut the son of a bitch.

1139
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:46,420
The hell you are.
That's a new anchor.

1140
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:48,120
- Damn, it is heavy, though.
- Yeah, it is!

1141
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:50,720
All right, keep pulling.

1142
01:14:51,190 --> 01:14:53,120
What the hell?

1143
01:14:53,130 --> 01:14:55,530
Jesus Christ! Stay back, son!

1144
01:14:55,530 --> 01:14:57,690
Turn around. Don't look.

1145
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:24,120
How'd they die?

1146
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:25,990
Looks like a gun fight.

1147
01:15:25,990 --> 01:15:27,990
Can you give me race and sex?

1148
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:30,130
Male Hispanics, all three.

1149
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:32,460
Why the chicken wire?

1150
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:36,870
As their bodies bloat, the wire cuts
them, releasing the decomp gas.

1151
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:38,970
They never float to the surface.

1152
01:15:38,970 --> 01:15:41,210
Yeah, great tip.
I gotta remember that one.

1153
01:15:41,210 --> 01:15:42,740
Okay, how long they been dead?

1154
01:15:42,740 --> 01:15:43,940
- A week.
- You sure?

1155
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:45,740
- A what?
- At least a week.

1156
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:48,180
If it's the guys that we think is...

1157
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:50,480
- They've been dead more than a week...
- Wait, are these the...

1158
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,780
- The military guys from the cartel?
- Yeah.

1159
01:15:52,790 --> 01:15:54,890
You think this is them?
The Guatemalans.

1160
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:56,150
I think it's them.

1161
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:57,860
He said they've been
dead for a week.

1162
01:15:57,860 --> 01:15:59,520
It can't be the Guatemalans.

1163
01:15:59,530 --> 01:16:01,660
That's why we need
to find these tattoos.

1164
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:04,130
The guy at the cabin had a
tattoo on his left shoulder.

1165
01:16:04,130 --> 01:16:06,530
And if we have a match, then they're
part of the same gang, right?

1166
01:16:06,530 --> 01:16:09,600
The killers are the victims?
It just can't be that, Caroline.

1167
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,540
Tattoo, left shoulder.
Have we got anything? Ah, nice!

1168
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:15,910
We got it. Darius, come see this.

1169
01:16:15,910 --> 01:16:17,240
This is our guy.

1170
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,640
- That's it?
- Mmm-hmm.

1171
01:16:19,650 --> 01:16:20,650
Who the hell killed them?

1172
01:16:20,650 --> 01:16:21,910
Nice.

1173
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:22,880
Here we go.

1174
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:24,650
What you got?

1175
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:26,990
Thumb's missing.

1176
01:16:26,990 --> 01:16:29,720
- Right here.
- Right.

1177
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:35,160
Okay, so that explains how we got
thumbprints in Roberts' RV, huh?

1178
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:37,540
Looks like we're working late.

1179
01:16:47,210 --> 01:16:50,070
Look, if they've been dead
a week already, right?

1180
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:52,780
They sure as hell didn't
nail Jordan to that ceiling.

1181
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:54,810
Or drive Roberts over
the train tracks.

1182
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:57,550
The Guatemalans killed
Tripod McNeely, okay?

1183
01:16:57,550 --> 01:17:00,020
Then somebody kills them,
uses them for cover.

1184
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:02,150
Come on, Darius, think about it.

1185
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:04,120
Who killed the cartel hit men,

1186
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:06,860
sprinkles their DNA over
two separate crime scenes,

1187
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:09,230
wants us to think they're alive?
Who do we like for this?

1188
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:13,000
Everybody! We like
everybody for this one!

1189
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:27,180
<i>John, please! John!</i>

1190
01:17:27,180 --> 01:17:28,950
- <i>Tell John to come for you!
- John! Please, John!</i>

1191
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:31,780
<i>- Tell him to come for you!
<i>- John!</i></i>

1192
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:35,290
<i>Come find me! John!</i>

1193
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:37,120
<i>Please!</i>

1194
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:43,890
<i>Oh, no!</i>

1195
01:17:52,270 --> 01:17:53,840
<i>We had a good time, didn't we?</i>

1196
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,420
<i>I love you, John!</i>

1197
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,120
Who the fuck is hunting us?

1198
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,960
Who do you think, Breach?

1199
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:20,020
It's one of us.

1200
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:21,260
It's you!

1201
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:23,060
Or it's Grinder!

1202
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:26,030
Or Sugar! Or my dear
loving husband!

1203
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:28,230
Is it you, bitch?

1204
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:30,890
No, I keep track of
the people I whack.

1205
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:33,300
Neck and Pyro ain't on the list.

1206
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:35,740
See, I think that she's right!

1207
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:39,740
I think she's fucking
right. Nailed it.

1208
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:41,780
So which fucker is it, huh?

1209
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:48,790
Fucking crazy! I mean, why?

1210
01:19:48,790 --> 01:19:51,020
You know why, Breach.
It was the fucking money.

1211
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:52,720
Amen.

1212
01:19:52,730 --> 01:19:55,190
'Cause some of us are getting paid, and...

1213
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:57,400
the rest of us are just getting dead.

1214
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,260
Oh, bullshit!

1215
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:02,100
Keep your hands where
we can see them.

1216
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:05,470
This has been fun,
but I'm out of here.

1217
01:20:05,470 --> 01:20:08,840
I see any of your fucking
faces and I'll kill you!

1218
01:20:09,170 --> 01:20:11,970
Ammo's cheap. My life ain't!

1219
01:20:13,950 --> 01:20:16,180
It's over.

1220
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:19,720
Where'd you bury it, Grinder?

1221
01:20:27,830 --> 01:20:30,560
Now we fall apart?

1222
01:20:31,130 --> 01:20:33,770
We scatter to the wind?

1223
01:20:33,770 --> 01:20:35,730
Yeah, I like that idea.

1224
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:39,900
Honey.

1225
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:41,900
Yes, sweetheart?

1226
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:45,580
I've been fucking Sugar.

1227
01:20:47,410 --> 01:20:49,680
What the fuck are you doing?

1228
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:52,080
That's not what we talked about!

1229
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,850
Look, man.

1230
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:56,450
Look, it is what it is, dude.

1231
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:59,020
What do you want me to say?
You want me to say I'm sorry?

1232
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:01,160
Is it gonna make it any better?

1233
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:02,960
You fucker! I'm going to kill you!

1234
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,360
Monster! No!

1235
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:07,330
I thought you were
my fucking friend!

1236
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:10,100
Boss, I'm gonna kill him!
I'm gonna fucking kill him!

1237
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:12,300
Get the fuck out of here!

1238
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:14,370
Why the fuck would
you do that shit?

1239
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:16,040
Get the fuck out of here!

1240
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,540
Fucking have a nice life,
you fucking cunt!

1241
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:20,240
You deserve each other!

1242
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:23,950
I warned you.

1243
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:27,980
We fucked up.

1244
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:31,250
We fucked up, didn't we?

1245
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:44,870
What do you want?

1246
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,870
Can we talk?

1247
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:50,070
We stole the money.

1248
01:21:52,310 --> 01:21:54,580
It was Breacher's idea.

1249
01:21:54,580 --> 01:21:57,250
We thought it would make him happy.

1250
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:00,250
It was $10 million in cash.

1251
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:03,290
Went back for it that night,

1252
01:22:03,290 --> 01:22:06,860
but when we got there, it was gone.

1253
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:09,430
DEA, they wanted to
throw us in a hole

1254
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:12,030
and throw away the hole.

1255
01:22:12,030 --> 01:22:15,570
Crawled up our asses with a
microscope for six months.

1256
01:22:15,570 --> 01:22:17,800
Nobody broke.

1257
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:21,300
So who has the money?

1258
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:24,010
It's Lizzy.

1259
01:22:24,210 --> 01:22:26,740
Or Monster or Sugar.

1260
01:22:27,210 --> 01:22:28,880
I don't know.

1261
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:31,060
She's playing one
against the other.

1262
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:33,890
What do you want to do?

1263
01:22:33,890 --> 01:22:36,890
Fuck 'em all. Let 'em hang.

1264
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:49,270
After I lost my family,

1265
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:52,340
I asked myself what
was I fighting for.

1266
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,510
The answer was simple.

1267
01:22:54,510 --> 01:22:56,340
My team.

1268
01:22:57,280 --> 01:23:00,180
I wanted them to get something
out of all of this.

1269
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:01,740
But instead,

1270
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:05,750
I destroyed them.

1271
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:10,150
Agent Phillips has gone to the DA.

1272
01:23:15,990 --> 01:23:19,260
I'm not telling you
it's gonna be okay.

1273
01:23:21,070 --> 01:23:22,870
Because it's not.

1274
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:25,800
Not for you.

1275
01:23:45,590 --> 01:23:47,960
- Hey, John.
- Hey.

1276
01:23:52,230 --> 01:23:53,830
I'm sorry.

1277
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:56,900
Don't apologize.

1278
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:02,670
I would have stepped
up if you didn't.

1279
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:06,040
You're doing the right thing.

1280
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:09,310
I ride this ship down.

1281
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:11,780
I ride it down.

1282
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:14,350
But you,

1283
01:24:14,350 --> 01:24:16,120
you could still have
a life after this.

1284
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:18,290
Doing what, John?

1285
01:24:18,690 --> 01:24:20,720
Where?

1286
01:24:20,730 --> 01:24:22,630
This is all I do.

1287
01:24:22,630 --> 01:24:24,890
And it's over.

1288
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:28,230
We can protect you.

1289
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:32,170
Get down!

1290
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:34,200
Stay down.

1291
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:52,090
Tell me again.

1292
01:24:52,090 --> 01:24:54,590
We were up the block,
heard gunfire.

1293
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:57,400
We made contact with
a female DEA agent.

1294
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,100
Female DEA agent?

1295
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:01,170
She left in a vehicle
with a black male.

1296
01:25:01,170 --> 01:25:04,240
A DEA agent. You heard gunfire!

1297
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:06,440
Sir, she badged us. She was legit.

1298
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:07,640
She left.

1299
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:09,510
Is this the woman you saw?

1300
01:25:09,510 --> 01:25:11,510
Yeah. That's her.

1301
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:14,210
You said "black male"?

1302
01:25:14,210 --> 01:25:16,580
- Yes, sir.
- A red vehicle.

1303
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:19,150
- Sugar.
- That's your guy, too?

1304
01:25:49,710 --> 01:25:51,780
Clear.

1305
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,320
What's all this?

1306
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,790
She's bailing.

1307
01:26:00,790 --> 01:26:03,390
She'll never make it. Every cop
in Georgia's looking for her.

1308
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:05,560
She won't get far.

1309
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:07,560
Yes, she will.

1310
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:13,670
Do you think that he loves you?

1311
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:17,570
What do you think the plan is?
To just go run off and make babies?

1312
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:21,080
Well, you're gonna be needing this.

1313
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:26,720
Just give me my shit

1314
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:29,290
and quit fucking around.

1315
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:39,760
Don't do it! Monster!

1316
01:26:42,430 --> 01:26:44,330
Fuck you!

1317
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:50,970
Oh, fuck.

1318
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:53,510
Baby, I'm sorry!

1319
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:58,580
Baby. Oh, God.

1320
01:26:59,350 --> 01:27:01,280
Lay down.

1321
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:06,190
I'm sorry, Monster. I'm sorry.

1322
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:22,340
Oh, Jesus!

1323
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:26,280
Jesus!

1324
01:27:55,810 --> 01:27:58,440
I'm going to kill her.

1325
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:03,750
Yeah?

1326
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:05,820
<i>Hey. I fucked up.</i>

1327
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:07,720
<i>I didn't mean for this to happen.
I don't know what to do.</i>

1328
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:09,990
- Where are you?
<i>- Midtown.</i>

1329
01:28:09,990 --> 01:28:12,390
- Are you alone?
<i>- Yeah, I'm alone.</i>

1330
01:28:12,390 --> 01:28:14,690
Who would I be with?

1331
01:28:14,690 --> 01:28:18,430
<i>- Can I see you?
- Meet me inside the parking structure on 4th.</i>

1332
01:28:18,430 --> 01:28:21,430
<i>Thanks, Breach. I'll see you soon.</i>

1333
01:28:23,430 --> 01:28:26,400
That motherfucker!

1334
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:28,370
Parking garage?

1335
01:28:28,410 --> 01:28:29,510
Mmm.

1336
01:28:29,510 --> 01:28:31,910
This ain't his first rodeo.

1337
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:34,240
Since he wants to be a hero,

1338
01:28:35,010 --> 01:28:37,210
let's give him somebody to save.

1339
01:28:41,850 --> 01:28:46,260
Federal agent! Get out of the
fucking car! Did you hear me?

1340
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:47,990
- Open the fucking door!
- Open the fucking door!

1341
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:50,090
Get out of the fucking car!

1342
01:29:03,940 --> 01:29:07,140
There she is. Get down.

1343
01:29:41,650 --> 01:29:43,550
He's down! He's down!

1344
01:29:50,090 --> 01:29:52,190
Who the fuck is that in the car?

1345
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:57,730
Shit!

1346
01:29:57,730 --> 01:29:59,460
It's that bitch!

1347
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:19,450
Go, go, go, go!

1348
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:30,830
Hold your ass, sweetie! Here we go!

1349
01:30:40,670 --> 01:30:42,500
Jesus Christ!

1350
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:45,840
Take the vest!

1351
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:48,310
Put it on the dash and stay down!

1352
01:30:50,010 --> 01:30:51,680
Fuck me!

1353
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:53,850
Lizzy, handle that motherfucker!

1354
01:30:58,690 --> 01:31:00,420
Oh, fuck!

1355
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:12,300
Oh, baby, I fucked that bitch up!

1356
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:15,600
Jesus Christ!

1357
01:31:17,410 --> 01:31:19,170
Fuck!

1358
01:31:29,620 --> 01:31:31,520
Get the fuck out of the way!

1359
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,700
We lost them, Sug!

1360
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:42,970
Oh, shit.

1361
01:31:42,970 --> 01:31:45,590
We're gonna make it, baby.
We're gonna make it!

1362
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,540
Fuck, he's still coming!

1363
01:31:53,810 --> 01:31:55,910
Let's give him a 180!

1364
01:32:03,890 --> 01:32:05,190
Shit!

1365
01:32:05,190 --> 01:32:06,890
Turn around! Turn around!

1366
01:32:06,890 --> 01:32:08,710
I can't make it!

1367
01:32:09,990 --> 01:32:11,890
Baby,

1368
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:13,900
kill that motherfucker!

1369
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:20,270
Fuck!

1370
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:27,910
Shoot the fucking engine!

1371
01:32:28,950 --> 01:32:31,210
Fucking die!

1372
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:34,160
Watch out!

1373
01:32:36,620 --> 01:32:38,880
Now, get us the fuck out of here!

1374
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:40,790
Fuck!

1375
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:42,830
I got no eyes!

1376
01:32:42,830 --> 01:32:44,930
I can't see shit!

1377
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:14,590
Drop the weapon, Lizzy!

1378
01:33:25,770 --> 01:33:28,540
Okay. Okay.

1379
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:32,410
Hey, Breach.

1380
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:36,780
You killed my team.

1381
01:33:37,180 --> 01:33:39,650
Why, Lizzy? Why?

1382
01:33:39,650 --> 01:33:42,990
Because they stole my money! Huh!

1383
01:33:43,050 --> 01:33:45,320
They fucking robbed me!

1384
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:47,660
After everything I put up with!

1385
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:50,830
It was my money and they took
it, and I couldn't find it!

1386
01:33:51,130 --> 01:33:52,960
I said, "Fuck them."

1387
01:33:54,670 --> 01:33:57,700
I took the money. I took it.

1388
01:33:57,700 --> 01:33:59,770
You took the money?

1389
01:34:00,140 --> 01:34:02,000
What does that mean?

1390
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:04,010
Why?

1391
01:34:07,710 --> 01:34:09,680
Mexico.

1392
01:34:10,110 --> 01:34:12,680
This is about fucking Mexico?

1393
01:34:13,050 --> 01:34:16,850
Your family is never coming home!

1394
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:18,920
What is she talking about?

1395
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:21,330
And nothing you do

1396
01:34:21,330 --> 01:34:23,560
will ever change that!

1397
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:26,700
You hear me?

1398
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:32,340
What the fuck was that?

1399
01:34:36,310 --> 01:34:40,040
Just be a good girl and walk away.

1400
01:34:45,150 --> 01:34:46,820
Hey! Hey!

1401
01:34:46,820 --> 01:34:48,680
What the fuck...

1402
01:34:48,690 --> 01:34:49,950
I can't.

1403
01:34:49,950 --> 01:34:53,320
- Pull it together. You okay?
- Yeah.

1404
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:55,330
- Okay, you hurt? Anything?
- No, I'm okay.

1405
01:34:55,330 --> 01:34:57,590
- All right, just take it easy.
- Where's Breacher?

1406
01:34:57,590 --> 01:35:01,500
He's right there. Where the
fuck is he? He was right there.

1407
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:03,800
We've got three vics.

1408
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:04,870
We've got to find him.

1409
01:35:04,870 --> 01:35:06,070
Shit!

1410
01:35:06,070 --> 01:35:07,300
Find Breacher!

1411
01:35:07,310 --> 01:35:09,530
You heard her, spread out!

1412
01:35:10,770 --> 01:35:12,810
- Check the truck!
- On it. On it.

1413
01:35:12,810 --> 01:35:14,850
No! Nothing!

1414
01:35:14,850 --> 01:35:18,080
I don't see him. I don't see him.

1415
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:24,590
What the fuck happened, Caroline?

1416
01:35:25,390 --> 01:35:28,360
What the fuck did you do?

1417
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:30,600
Mmm.

1418
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:43,650
You're mine.

1419
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:54,520
Your wife.

1420
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:57,130
I was the last to have her.

1421
01:39:57,130 --> 01:39:58,960
You can't take that back.

1422
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:01,660
I can take your family.

1423
01:40:03,270 --> 01:40:05,470
But I'm not like you.
