1
00:04:14,772 --> 00:04:18,818
-(chickens clucking)
- Come on, come on. It's all right.

2
00:04:18,901 --> 00:04:21,112
Yes, yes, it's all right.

3
00:04:28,953 --> 00:04:31,164
Wake up, Will.

4
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:40,214
Starboard bow ahoy!

5
00:04:48,556 --> 00:04:51,100
- What is it, SIade?
- Thought I heard somethin'.

6
00:04:51,184 --> 00:04:53,269
Sounded Iike a bell.

7
00:04:54,854 --> 00:04:59,067
- Native fishermen, perhaps.
- Or a reef marker, sir.

8
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,111
Mr Calamy, the Iead, if you please.

9
00:05:17,043 --> 00:05:21,214
- By the mark, five fathom.
- Five fathom!

10
00:05:35,395 --> 00:05:38,690
- Sand and broken shell.
- Sand and broken shell.

11
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,824
What is it?

12
00:05:47,907 --> 00:05:49,826
Um...

13
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:52,537
Two points off the starboard bow,
in the fog bank.

14
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,664
What was it? A sail?

15
00:05:54,747 --> 00:05:59,252
- I don't know what it was.
- Should we beat to quarters?

16
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:10,888
- I can't be certain.
- You're officer of the watch.

17
00:06:10,972 --> 00:06:13,975
Hollom, you must make a decision.

18
00:06:15,518 --> 00:06:17,812
We shall beat to quarters!

19
00:06:20,023 --> 00:06:23,192
(man) Rouse up! Rouse up!
SIeepers awake!

20
00:06:27,447 --> 00:06:29,532
Move! Move along! Move along!

21
00:06:29,616 --> 00:06:32,744
Jump to it, boys! Jump to it!

22
00:06:34,203 --> 00:06:36,122
Light along there!

23
00:06:57,894 --> 00:06:59,520
Sighting in heavy fog.

24
00:06:59,604 --> 00:07:03,149
- Handsomely on the yards tackle.
- Topmen aloft.

25
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,202
- Where away?
- Uh...

26
00:07:14,285 --> 00:07:19,040
Two points off the starboard bow, sir.
Not a mile distant.

27
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,921
- You sure, Mr Hollom?
- Yes, sir.

28
00:07:26,297 --> 00:07:28,383
Man-of-war?

29
00:07:30,385 --> 00:07:32,261
I don't know, sir.

30
00:07:32,345 --> 00:07:36,182
It was only for a moment.
I thought I saw a shape.

31
00:07:39,102 --> 00:07:42,397
- Did you see it, Mr Calamy?
- No, sir.

32
00:07:44,482 --> 00:07:49,153
Well, you did the right thing, Mr Hollom.
Go to your stations.

33
00:07:50,613 --> 00:07:52,991
The deck's yours, Tom.

34
00:07:53,074 --> 00:07:54,534
Sir.

35
00:07:57,036 --> 00:08:00,832
CIear away! And Iaunch boats!

36
00:08:08,881 --> 00:08:11,634
- Quit your dawdling!
- You heard the man!

37
00:08:11,718 --> 00:08:14,178
Lower away!

38
00:08:16,848 --> 00:08:18,182
Haul both your yard tackles!

39
00:08:23,438 --> 00:08:25,189
Strike the bell!

40
00:08:25,273 --> 00:08:27,692
(bell sounds)

41
00:08:52,425 --> 00:08:54,802
Down! AII hands down!

42
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:13,321
Hands to your stations!
Mr Hollar, damage report, if you please.

43
00:09:22,455 --> 00:09:26,292
18-pounders. We'II have to get closer.
Run out the starboard battery.

44
00:09:26,376 --> 00:09:30,171
Mr AIIen, come up on the wind.
Lay me alongside at pistol-shot.

45
00:09:36,344 --> 00:09:38,596
Sharpshooters to the tops, Mr Howard.

46
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,266
Sergeant! Take your section
into the main top.

47
00:09:41,349 --> 00:09:44,310
We stand tall on the quarterdeck, son.
AII of us.

48
00:09:45,436 --> 00:09:48,398
- Mr Boyle, run up the colours.
- Aye, sir.

49
00:09:53,403 --> 00:09:57,365
Note for the Iog, Mr Watt.
"Engaged enemy frigate at six bells."

50
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:04,497
- Straight at 'em, Mr Mowett.
- Straight at 'em, sir.

51
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,000
Bill!

52
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,961
Leave the swords!
Get the captain's silver below.

53
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:14,090
She's not in range yet!
Stand fast till she's close enough!

54
00:10:14,173 --> 00:10:18,011
- CIose with him amidships!
- Midships it is, sir!

55
00:10:18,678 --> 00:10:21,014
For God's sake, don't drop anything!

56
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:27,520
Steady!

57
00:10:27,604 --> 00:10:31,149
- Hold your positions!
- Hold your position! Courage, now!

58
00:10:32,275 --> 00:10:36,613
- Hold steady, boys!
- Don't worry, Iads, we'II serve 'em out yet!

59
00:10:36,696 --> 00:10:41,075
Mr Pullings, sir.
Davies, Jemmy, get Mr Pullings below.

60
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,827
Aye, sir.

61
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,455
Mr BIakeney, pass the word for the captain.

62
00:10:45,538 --> 00:10:48,291
CIear the forward pin rails!

63
00:10:54,714 --> 00:10:56,341
More sand on the floor!

64
00:10:57,925 --> 00:11:00,011
On the up-roll... fire!

65
00:11:13,024 --> 00:11:14,692
Down!

66
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:28,206
Relieving-tackles on the tiller!
You men, collect these wounded!

67
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:35,421
- Keep 'em spitting, Mr Calamy.
- Aye, sir. Reload and give 'em hell!

68
00:12:01,572 --> 00:12:03,866
Sir! To the taffrail!

69
00:12:10,415 --> 00:12:13,501
The rudder's shot away.
The steering don't answer, sir.

70
00:12:13,584 --> 00:12:15,878
We're fish in a barrel.

71
00:12:23,136 --> 00:12:25,471
Why are we not firing?

72
00:12:29,934 --> 00:12:31,436
Let me through.

73
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,022
Here, Joe! Here!

74
00:12:34,105 --> 00:12:36,190
Hold it in there!

75
00:12:40,653 --> 00:12:45,658
- He's on the Iarboard bow, sir.
- Bring up your small arms!

76
00:12:48,745 --> 00:12:51,247
Prepare to repel boarders.

77
00:12:51,331 --> 00:12:54,500
Seize your weapons
and wait for the word.

78
00:12:56,586 --> 00:12:58,921
(Pullings) Your orders, sir?

79
00:12:59,881 --> 00:13:04,260
Call the gun crews to deck. Rig man-ropes
over the stern and pull the boats in.

80
00:13:04,344 --> 00:13:06,930
Put us in that fog, Tom.

81
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:20,443
Pull together, men!

82
00:13:20,526 --> 00:13:22,654
Pull for the fog bank!

83
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,574
Run 'em out! Run 'em out!

84
00:13:30,954 --> 00:13:32,622
Fire!

85
00:13:33,915 --> 00:13:37,961
She's opened up a seam!
We need to get some oakum and pound it in.

86
00:13:38,044 --> 00:13:40,797
Joe, a mallet and some irons!

87
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:48,930
She's gaining on us.

88
00:13:56,062 --> 00:13:59,983
- We're nearly there, boys!
- Pull! Pull!

89
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:03,278
- Reach for it, men!
- We're home inside that fog!

90
00:14:08,032 --> 00:14:09,367
Fire!

91
00:14:10,952 --> 00:14:13,871
Pull for Lucky Jack!

92
00:14:13,955 --> 00:14:16,124
We've done it!

93
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:21,296
Pipe down. Silence on deck.

94
00:14:31,222 --> 00:14:34,350
They'II not find us in here!

95
00:14:34,434 --> 00:14:38,062
(Calamy) Quiet, Iads. No shouts, no calls.

96
00:15:06,049 --> 00:15:08,259
Avast rowing.

97
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:13,598
Well done, Iads.

98
00:15:18,978 --> 00:15:22,023
(clanking and grinding of pumps)

99
00:15:37,622 --> 00:15:40,959
Two feet six inches, sir... and holding.

100
00:15:44,587 --> 00:15:47,340
- Good work, Mr Lamb.
- Thank you, sir.

101
00:15:57,892 --> 00:16:00,061
So, what's the butcher's bill?

102
00:16:00,144 --> 00:16:02,730
Nine dead, 27 wounded.

103
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,449
Joe PIaice.

104
00:16:13,533 --> 00:16:18,913
He has a severely depressed fracture of
the skull. I don't think he'II see out the night.

105
00:16:18,955 --> 00:16:21,749
Lord BIakeney.

106
00:16:24,127 --> 00:16:26,421
Just a broken arm, sir.

107
00:16:27,714 --> 00:16:30,675
Well, you're in very good hands.

108
00:16:35,388 --> 00:16:38,975
I'm doing everything I can.
I know you were close to his father.

109
00:16:39,058 --> 00:16:43,438
His father would've understood.
He knew the Iife. His mother, however...

110
00:16:43,521 --> 00:16:47,025
Let me take a Iook at that brow of yours.

111
00:16:47,108 --> 00:16:48,985
What?

112
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,826
Damn, he was good.
Just came out of nowhere.

113
00:16:56,909 --> 00:17:02,040
Hit us with a full broadside,
cut across our tail and took out our rudder.

114
00:17:02,123 --> 00:17:04,375
Damn fine gunnery.

115
00:17:05,335 --> 00:17:10,006
We only slipped away because of the fog.
Quite fortunate, really.

116
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:14,844
He may have had the weather gauge,
but we had the weather gods.

117
00:17:15,887 --> 00:17:21,726
I have no idea what it is you're talking about,
but he did seem to come off rather well.

118
00:17:22,644 --> 00:17:27,941
Seven weeks sailing, and he happens
in darkness on our exact position.

119
00:17:28,024 --> 00:17:30,234
Hm.

120
00:17:30,318 --> 00:17:34,489
Well, the French have their spies
in England and elsewhere. As do we.

121
00:17:35,114 --> 00:17:36,991
Indeed.

122
00:17:38,201 --> 00:17:44,290
If he knew we were Iooking for him, he could
have stood to sea and passed well clear.

123
00:17:44,374 --> 00:17:47,543
Well then, perhaps he was Iooking for us.

124
00:18:13,736 --> 00:18:16,281
If she was a frigate, then I am a Dutchman!

125
00:18:16,364 --> 00:18:19,325
It was an unfair match.
There was no dishonour in it.

126
00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:21,661
She was more Iike a ship of the Iine.

127
00:18:21,744 --> 00:18:25,081
You have to wonder about her hull.
Our shots wouldn't penetrate.

128
00:18:25,164 --> 00:18:27,792
Triple-shotted at 200 yards - no effect.

129
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:31,629
She had the weather gauge
and a clear advantage in firepower.

130
00:18:31,713 --> 00:18:34,299
What is the weather gauge?

131
00:18:34,382 --> 00:18:37,927
- Shall I show you again, Stephen?
- Not on the cloth!

132
00:18:40,013 --> 00:18:44,142
It means she had the wind in her favour,
therefore control of the engagement.

133
00:18:44,225 --> 00:18:47,562
And she had Ionger guns,
so she could hit us beyond our range.

134
00:18:47,645 --> 00:18:51,316
The simple fact is we were soundly beaten.

135
00:18:53,735 --> 00:18:58,865
- Heavy frigate Iike that in the Pacific...
- Could tip the war in Napoleon's favour.

136
00:18:59,407 --> 00:19:04,495
By comparison, the Surprise
is a somewhat aged man-of-war.

137
00:19:08,207 --> 00:19:13,004
- Am I not correct?
- Would you call me an aged man of war?

138
00:19:13,087 --> 00:19:16,424
The Surprise is not old.
No one would call her old.

139
00:19:16,507 --> 00:19:22,680
She has a bluff bow, Iovely Iines.
She's a fine sea boat, weatherly, stiff and fast.

140
00:19:22,764 --> 00:19:26,142
Very fast, if she's well-handled.

141
00:19:26,225 --> 00:19:28,353
No, she's not old.

142
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:31,689
She's in her prime.

143
00:19:31,773 --> 00:19:36,361
We can patch up the main and mizzen.
Foresail's gone, so we'II bend our spare.

144
00:19:36,444 --> 00:19:40,531
Mr Lamb is confident with basic repairs.
We can get home as we are.

145
00:19:40,615 --> 00:19:43,451
We're not going home.

146
00:19:52,377 --> 00:19:56,547
But to refit we need a port,
and the Acheron may be still Iooking for us.

147
00:19:56,631 --> 00:20:00,969
We can refit at sea.
Here, where it shoals.

148
00:20:02,178 --> 00:20:06,933
As you said, Mr AIIen, she is taking the war to
the South Seas. We are supposed to stop her.

149
00:20:07,016 --> 00:20:14,274
But, sir - with respect - she's a vastly
heavier ship. She's out of our class.

150
00:20:15,191 --> 00:20:18,903
She could be halfway to Cape Horn
by the time we're repaired.

151
00:20:18,987 --> 00:20:22,657
Well then, there's not a moment to Iose.

152
00:20:22,991 --> 00:20:25,535
(shouting and hammering)

153
00:20:37,463 --> 00:20:39,716
(thudding above)

154
00:20:41,092 --> 00:20:44,262
Is it true they put the Iast stitch
through your nose?

155
00:20:44,345 --> 00:20:46,431
What do you mean?

156
00:20:47,473 --> 00:20:52,854
Joe said when you die, they stitch you in your
hammock with the Iast stitch in your nose,

157
00:20:52,895 --> 00:20:56,107
just to make sure you're not asleep.

158
00:20:59,736 --> 00:21:03,197
Not through the nose. You'II tell them?

159
00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:04,384
It's all right.
It's just the Iaudanum speaking.

160
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:40,753
I've never seen a braver patient.

161
00:22:45,592 --> 00:22:49,637
Poor darling.
Never mind, soon have you fixed up.

162
00:22:49,721 --> 00:22:51,681
I want good work now.

163
00:22:51,764 --> 00:22:56,269
I'II need two men into the starboard
forechannels. Roberts, Chadwick.

164
00:22:56,352 --> 00:22:58,438
That's nice work there.

165
00:22:58,521 --> 00:23:01,816
Repair won't do here.
I need these replaced.

166
00:23:08,531 --> 00:23:11,868
Mr Calamy. There's something
might interest you here.

167
00:23:11,951 --> 00:23:16,539
Look. The captain carved that.
When he was a mid, no more than your age.

168
00:23:16,623 --> 00:23:18,499
He's known this ship man and boy.

169
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:23,796
He says there's enough of his blood in the
woodwork for the ship to almost be a relation.

170
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,134
I do understand your point, Mr AIIen.
Your knowledge is beyond question.

171
00:23:28,217 --> 00:23:33,640
However, a week in the Brazilian rainforest
Iooking for a new mast simply will not do.

172
00:23:33,723 --> 00:23:35,975
The Acheron will be halfway to China.

173
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:41,814
Mr Lamb, as always, will do his best. Which
is all I can hope to expect from any man.

174
00:24:15,848 --> 00:24:17,642
Is them his brains?

175
00:24:17,725 --> 00:24:21,562
No, that's just dried blood.
Those are his brains.

176
00:24:21,646 --> 00:24:23,898
(awed murmuring)

177
00:24:26,943 --> 00:24:30,280
Physician, he is.
Ain't one of your common surgeons.

178
00:24:30,363 --> 00:24:33,533
- Can I have the coin, please?
- Sir.

179
00:24:38,246 --> 00:24:40,999
He wouldn't Iook at you
for under ten guineas on Iand.

180
00:24:41,082 --> 00:24:43,251
And he knows his birds and beasts.

181
00:24:43,334 --> 00:24:46,713
You show him a beetle
and he'II tell you what it's thinking.

182
00:24:46,796 --> 00:24:50,341
Back to work, you Ioafers!
Eckhart, use your pipe.

183
00:24:50,425 --> 00:24:52,844
Let's get on with it, gentlemen.

184
00:24:52,927 --> 00:24:56,723
You're not a pennyweight of use
gawpin' here!

185
00:25:00,393 --> 00:25:03,229
(Aubrey clears his throat)

186
00:25:03,313 --> 00:25:05,898
Still hasn't said a word, sir.

187
00:25:11,321 --> 00:25:14,324
Lord BIakeney. Feeling better?

188
00:25:14,407 --> 00:25:16,492
Much better, thank you, sir.

189
00:25:16,576 --> 00:25:18,661
Well, good. Good.

190
00:25:20,538 --> 00:25:24,667
The doctor told me
you were fond of reading, so I...

191
00:25:30,924 --> 00:25:34,427
It has all of his major battles
and some fine illustrations.

192
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,429
Thank you, sir.

193
00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:40,224
Did you ever meet Lord Nelson, sir?

194
00:25:40,308 --> 00:25:44,020
I had the honour of serving with him.
At the Nile. A great victory.

195
00:25:44,103 --> 00:25:50,193
You can find it in here, actually.
Page 135, if I'm not mistaken.

196
00:25:51,611 --> 00:25:53,488
Yes.

197
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:03,289
May I beg you to tell me
what kind of man he is?

198
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,502
You should read the book.

199
00:26:07,585 --> 00:26:10,171
I will, sir. Thank you.

200
00:26:28,898 --> 00:26:30,775
(violin tuning up)

201
00:26:30,858 --> 00:26:35,989
Here we go again.
Scrape-scrape, screech-screech.

202
00:26:36,072 --> 00:26:39,993
Never a tune you could dance to,
not if you were drunk as Davy's sow.

203
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:49,794
(plucks cello strings)

204
00:26:49,877 --> 00:26:51,713
How about this?

205
00:26:51,796 --> 00:26:56,259
Or are you in the mood
for something more aggressive?

206
00:26:57,051 --> 00:26:59,345
(chamber music)

207
00:27:15,236 --> 00:27:18,072
(chamber music continues)

208
00:28:07,538 --> 00:28:09,540
(door opens)

209
00:28:09,624 --> 00:28:11,793
Salute.

210
00:28:11,876 --> 00:28:13,795
Hats off.

211
00:28:15,964 --> 00:28:18,132
What's all this about?

212
00:28:20,885 --> 00:28:24,222
- What's this?
- It's the phantom, sir.

213
00:28:24,305 --> 00:28:28,101
Excuse me. That's what the men call it.
It's the Acheron, sir.

214
00:28:28,184 --> 00:28:31,104
You see, Will here, he seen her being built.

215
00:28:31,187 --> 00:28:36,359
(Will) In Boston, sir. During the peace.
But she's Yankee-built, sir.

216
00:28:36,442 --> 00:28:40,363
He was getting married, and his wife's
second cousin works in the yards,

217
00:28:40,446 --> 00:28:42,699
so Will here saw the ship out of water.

218
00:28:42,782 --> 00:28:48,037
Sir, I saw there was something right strange
about her, so I asked Joe...

219
00:28:48,121 --> 00:28:51,416
So he described it to me
and I knocked you up a model, sir.

220
00:28:51,499 --> 00:28:56,254
- And this framing is accurate?
- Exactly accurate, sir.

221
00:28:56,337 --> 00:28:58,923
- Thank you, Iads.
- Thank you, sir.

222
00:28:59,007 --> 00:29:02,260
Killick, an extra ration of rum for these men.

223
00:29:02,343 --> 00:29:04,762
Thank you very much, sir.

224
00:29:04,846 --> 00:29:07,849
- Which I was saving for Salutin' Day.
- We'II drink wine.

225
00:29:07,932 --> 00:29:10,059
Oh, drink wine on Salutin' Day...

226
00:29:10,143 --> 00:29:12,854
BIuff above the water and sharp below.

227
00:29:12,895 --> 00:29:18,318
Gives the hull a finer entry and a Iong run
as she goes aft. That's why she's so fast.

228
00:29:18,401 --> 00:29:21,029
Heavier, but fast despite it.

229
00:29:22,071 --> 00:29:27,452
That's the future.
What a fascinating modern age we Iive in.

230
00:29:27,493 --> 00:29:31,372
PIanking and framing Iike that
would make her hull 2ft thick. Solid oak.

231
00:29:31,456 --> 00:29:36,419
That's why we couldn't dent her. She's
probably capable of making 12 to 14 knots.

232
00:29:37,086 --> 00:29:40,423
Now we know. Thank God for Warley
and his wife's second cousin.

233
00:29:40,506 --> 00:29:43,468
She could be doing up to 280 miles a day.

234
00:29:43,551 --> 00:29:49,599
Even if we did catch up with her...
I mean, to take her...

235
00:29:49,682 --> 00:29:53,811
She's out of our class.
She's a 44-gun ship.

236
00:29:55,396 --> 00:29:59,859
She's still vulnerable at the stern,
Iike the rest of us.

237
00:30:04,781 --> 00:30:07,951
(excited shouting and haggling)

238
00:30:13,581 --> 00:30:16,626
Hello, darling! How much for a kiss?

239
00:30:17,377 --> 00:30:19,420
Quanto cost-o kiss-o?

240
00:30:19,504 --> 00:30:22,715
- Name?
- My name is Maria.

241
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,094
Give us arrows. I give axe. Quick, mate.

242
00:30:26,177 --> 00:30:28,429
Thank you, mate.

243
00:30:37,063 --> 00:30:39,983
Gangway for the mail, please.

244
00:30:41,109 --> 00:30:44,529
- Here we are. Very important mail. Letters.
- Era um navio frances.

245
00:30:44,612 --> 00:30:47,907
- What's he saying?
- Estava indo pela costa?

246
00:30:47,991 --> 00:30:51,411
Sim, estava. Indo pela costa ao sul.

247
00:30:51,494 --> 00:30:55,331
A Iarge man-of-war, French, stopped here
on the 10th, then headed south.

248
00:30:55,415 --> 00:30:57,917
- Muito grande.
- Obrigado, senhor.

249
00:31:01,087 --> 00:31:02,922
Somewhere here.

250
00:31:03,006 --> 00:31:05,592
A full three weeks ahead.

251
00:31:05,675 --> 00:31:07,552
Damn.

252
00:31:08,469 --> 00:31:11,264
AII right, Tom, Iet's get all this squared away.

253
00:31:11,347 --> 00:31:15,268
Aye, sir. Mr Hollar!
Let us complete our business here.

254
00:31:15,351 --> 00:31:18,104
(Hollar) Hands, prepare to weigh anchor!

255
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:27,280
Put that woman down, SIade! This is a ship
of His Majesty's Navy, not a floating bordello!

256
00:31:30,074 --> 00:31:34,078
AII hands, get these provisions stowed.

257
00:31:34,412 --> 00:31:36,414
(laughter)

258
00:31:46,674 --> 00:31:48,301
Well done.

259
00:31:48,384 --> 00:31:50,470
Gentlemen...

260
00:31:51,471 --> 00:31:56,476
- To wives and to sweethearts.
- (all) To wives and sweethearts.

261
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,938
May they never meet.

262
00:32:00,021 --> 00:32:03,942
Mr Howard, the bottle.
The bottle stands by you, sir.

263
00:32:04,525 --> 00:32:06,861
Sir?

264
00:32:07,695 --> 00:32:12,283
Excuse me, sir, but Mr BIakeney said that
you served under Lord Nelson at the Nile.

265
00:32:12,367 --> 00:32:17,288
Indeed. I was a young Iieutenant,
not much older than you are now.

266
00:32:17,372 --> 00:32:20,959
And Mr Pullings... Mr Pullings
was a snivelling midshipman,

267
00:32:21,042 --> 00:32:23,419
still yearning for hearth and home.

268
00:32:23,503 --> 00:32:26,673
Did you meet him, sir?
Can you tell me what he's Iike?

269
00:32:26,756 --> 00:32:29,884
I have had the honour
of dining with him twice.

270
00:32:29,968 --> 00:32:32,845
He spoke to me on both occasions.

271
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:36,099
A master tactician
and a man of singular vision.

272
00:32:36,182 --> 00:32:41,437
He always said in battle... "Never mind
the manoeuvres, just go straight at 'em."

273
00:32:41,521 --> 00:32:45,692
Some would say not a great seaman,
but a great Ieader.

274
00:32:45,775 --> 00:32:48,820
He's England's only hope
if old Boney intends to invade.

275
00:32:48,903 --> 00:32:52,282
Sir, might we press you for an anecdote?

276
00:32:55,243 --> 00:32:58,329
The first time that he spoke to me...

277
00:32:58,413 --> 00:33:03,626
I shall never forget his words.
I remember it Iike it was yesterday.

278
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:07,463
He Ieaned across the table,
he Iooked me straight in the eye,

279
00:33:07,547 --> 00:33:12,218
and he said "Aubrey...
may I trouble you for the salt?"

280
00:33:14,262 --> 00:33:19,434
I've always tried to say it
exactly as he did ever since.

281
00:33:25,231 --> 00:33:30,612
The second time...
The second time he told me a story...

282
00:33:30,695 --> 00:33:34,240
about how someone offered him
a boat cloak on a cold night.

283
00:33:34,324 --> 00:33:39,203
And he said no, he didn't need it.
That he was quite warm.

284
00:33:39,287 --> 00:33:43,958
His zeal for king and country kept him warm.

285
00:33:44,042 --> 00:33:48,004
I know it sounds absurd,
and were it from another man,

286
00:33:48,087 --> 00:33:53,468
you'd cry out "Oh, what pitiful stuff"
and dismiss it as mere enthusiasm.

287
00:33:53,551 --> 00:33:55,637
But with Nelson...

288
00:33:57,513 --> 00:34:00,350
you felt your heart glow.

289
00:34:06,689 --> 00:34:11,653
- Wouldn't you say, Mr Pullings?
- You did indeed, sir.

290
00:34:12,236 --> 00:34:18,701
Well then, he would seem to be the exception
to the rule that authority corrupts.

291
00:34:18,785 --> 00:34:22,121
- To Lord Nelson.
- To Lord Nelson.

292
00:34:22,205 --> 00:34:24,457
(all) To Lord Nelson.

293
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:29,254
Do you see those two weevils, Doctor?

294
00:34:29,337 --> 00:34:30,880
I do.

295
00:34:30,964 --> 00:34:33,299
Which would you choose?

296
00:34:34,342 --> 00:34:40,223
Neither. There's no difference between them.
They're the same species of curculio.

297
00:34:40,306 --> 00:34:42,725
If you had to choose.

298
00:34:42,809 --> 00:34:46,271
If you were forced to make a choice.
If there was no other...

299
00:34:46,354 --> 00:34:49,983
Well then, if you're going to push me...

300
00:34:52,277 --> 00:34:55,280
I would choose the right-hand weevil.

301
00:34:55,363 --> 00:34:59,117
It has significant advantage
in both Iength and breadth.

302
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,537
There, I have you!
You're completely dished.

303
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:08,543
Do you not know that in the service one must
always choose the Iesser of two weevils?

304
00:35:15,216 --> 00:35:18,636
He who would pun would pick a pocket.

305
00:35:20,138 --> 00:35:22,390
Really! Weevils!

306
00:35:22,473 --> 00:35:27,770
- To the Iesser of two weevils.
- (all) To the Iesser of two weevils!

307
00:35:27,854 --> 00:35:30,440
(pipe and fiddle music)

308
00:35:38,448 --> 00:35:41,409
Yay, Joe!

309
00:35:43,953 --> 00:35:46,039
Go on, Joe!

310
00:36:04,682 --> 00:36:06,976
The Lord taketh...

311
00:36:08,186 --> 00:36:11,105
and the Lord giveth away.

312
00:36:11,189 --> 00:36:14,067
You hear that? He said something!

313
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:17,028
Doctor! He spoke, Doctor!

314
00:36:17,111 --> 00:36:19,030
Well done indeed, Stephen.

315
00:36:19,113 --> 00:36:22,116
? Adieu to you Spanish Iadies

316
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,329
? Farewell and adieu to you Iadies of Spain

317
00:36:26,412 --> 00:36:31,334
(faltering) ? For we've received orders
to sail for old England

318
00:36:31,417 --> 00:36:37,590
(alone) ? We hope in a short time
to see you again

319
00:36:38,466 --> 00:36:42,637
What a wonderfully true voice
Mr Hollom possesses.

320
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,265
Indeed.

321
00:36:46,391 --> 00:36:49,102
? Come, all you bold young thoughtless men

322
00:36:49,185 --> 00:36:51,688
? A warning take by me

323
00:36:51,771 --> 00:36:56,276
? And never Ieave your happy homes
to sail the raging sea

324
00:36:56,609 --> 00:36:58,695
(faint singing)

325
00:37:08,121 --> 00:37:11,249
(above) On deck there! Sail ho!

326
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:14,419
Looks Iike a frigate!

327
00:37:19,007 --> 00:37:21,134
(Allen) How did it get there?

328
00:37:21,217 --> 00:37:24,887
- We must turn and fight.
- But he has the weather gauge again.

329
00:37:24,971 --> 00:37:28,266
He must've been watching us
from some inlet.

330
00:37:32,228 --> 00:37:35,773
My God. What can we do?
He has us by the hip.

331
00:37:35,857 --> 00:37:37,859
Run Iike smoke and oakum.

332
00:37:37,942 --> 00:37:41,863
- We'II have to bend every sail.
- We'II put up our handkerchiefs if we have to!

333
00:37:41,946 --> 00:37:45,908
We must survive this day.
Let's get about it. Mr AIIen, gentlemen.

334
00:37:45,992 --> 00:37:48,036
AII hands, make sail!

335
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:53,041
This is the second time he's done this to me.
There will not be a third.

336
00:38:08,932 --> 00:38:14,687
I tell ya, the devil's at the wheel
of that there phantom ship.

337
00:38:14,771 --> 00:38:17,190
You better hold fast.

338
00:38:23,446 --> 00:38:25,615
What is it with this man?

339
00:38:25,698 --> 00:38:31,496
Did I kill a relative of his in battle, perhaps?
His boy, God forbid?

340
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:33,623
He fights Iike you, Jack.

341
00:38:52,225 --> 00:38:55,144
Bring the sun down to the horizon.

342
00:38:55,228 --> 00:38:59,440
When its Iower Iimb is touching the horizon...
Williamson, Iook to your sextant!

343
00:38:59,524 --> 00:39:03,403
When the orb is no Ionger rising...

344
00:39:03,486 --> 00:39:07,073
then it has reached its zenith
and that would be noon.

345
00:39:07,156 --> 00:39:09,534
- Sir?
- Mr Pullings.

346
00:39:09,617 --> 00:39:11,828
- Do you make noon, Mr Hollom?
- Yes, sir.

347
00:39:11,911 --> 00:39:14,414
Call noon. It's your class.

348
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:20,086
- (Hollom) Sir, that's noon.
- Mr Nichols, make that twelve.

349
00:39:20,169 --> 00:39:22,505
Six hours?

350
00:39:22,589 --> 00:39:24,841
Five at most.

351
00:39:24,924 --> 00:39:28,886
Just keep us out of her reach until nightfall.

352
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:41,941
She's to Iook Iike us, Iads, don't forget.
Jibbo, make fast those whips.

353
00:39:42,025 --> 00:39:45,486
We didn't want to make it any taller,
on account of this wind.

354
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:51,659
- Excuse me, sir, but what are they building?
- Your first command.

355
00:39:57,582 --> 00:39:59,959
(quietly) Quickly. She'II be on top of us.

356
00:40:00,043 --> 00:40:02,962
Take the weight on the yard tackles.

357
00:40:03,046 --> 00:40:05,340
Fend her off, fend her off.

358
00:40:05,423 --> 00:40:07,926
Lower away on the main.

359
00:40:14,891 --> 00:40:18,061
- Wouldn't want to Iose you.
- Aye, sir.

360
00:40:29,155 --> 00:40:34,702
There's a painter. Pass her aft.
Outside everything, mind.

361
00:40:34,786 --> 00:40:39,082
Lively now.
We've not ten minutes before he's up with us.

362
00:40:45,255 --> 00:40:49,092
- Mind what the captain told you.
- Pull, boys. That's it.

363
00:41:12,657 --> 00:41:13,700
Now.

364
00:41:19,372 --> 00:41:22,292
Killick there! Douse your Iight.

365
00:41:28,715 --> 00:41:30,341
Mr AIIen, make ready.

366
00:42:11,466 --> 00:42:13,968
Hello. We caught a fish.

367
00:42:15,511 --> 00:42:17,430
(Aubrey) Take the helm, Bonden.

368
00:42:17,513 --> 00:42:21,225
- Now, tell me that wasn't fun.
- Yes, sir.

369
00:42:22,977 --> 00:42:25,688
Hard a'Iarboard!

370
00:42:54,592 --> 00:42:59,097
Stand the men down, Mr Pullings.
I'II take this watch.

371
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,807
Aye, sir.

372
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:05,478
Mr Mowett, Mr AIIen, calmly now.
You know his orders.

373
00:43:05,561 --> 00:43:07,605
Well done, sir.

374
00:43:07,689 --> 00:43:09,357
(distant cannon fire)

375
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,028
She's a right phantom, she is. The way
she come up again, right behind us Iike that.

376
00:43:14,112 --> 00:43:19,492
Out of nowhere. And right behind us.
Like that first time, out the fog.

377
00:43:19,534 --> 00:43:22,036
With our shot bouncin' off her.

378
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,081
Captain's not called Lucky Jack for no reason.

379
00:43:25,164 --> 00:43:29,252
Phantom or no, she's a privateer,
and Lucky Jack'II have her.

380
00:43:29,335 --> 00:43:32,255
You need more than Iuck 'gainst a phantom.

381
00:43:34,048 --> 00:43:37,302
- Is she Iike a pirate?
- No, they're not pirates, Lofty.

382
00:43:37,385 --> 00:43:41,931
Oh, no. If they were,
we could hang them when we catch 'em.

383
00:43:42,015 --> 00:43:44,809
Privateer gets a piece of paper
from the Frenchies

384
00:43:44,892 --> 00:43:47,604
says they can hunt down
anything with our flag.

385
00:43:47,645 --> 00:43:51,316
They go after rich merchantmen and the Iike.

386
00:43:51,399 --> 00:43:55,153
Hey, but think on our share
of the prize money.

387
00:43:55,236 --> 00:44:00,241
She'II be Ioaded with gold
and ambergris and all the gems of Araby.

388
00:44:00,325 --> 00:44:03,828
That's all very well, Nagle.
Got to get home to spend it, but.

389
00:44:03,911 --> 00:44:06,247
Never met a dead man
who bought me a drink.

390
00:44:06,331 --> 00:44:10,293
And I've never met a Iive one
that you bought one for, neither.

391
00:44:11,669 --> 00:44:17,800
Sitting up all night, catching your death
of cold. That's the Iast of the coffee, too.

392
00:44:17,884 --> 00:44:19,969
Thank you, Killick.

393
00:44:24,307 --> 00:44:26,351
Bonden.

394
00:44:26,434 --> 00:44:29,604
That's enough easting.
Set a course sou'-sou'west.

395
00:44:29,687 --> 00:44:33,691
Aye, sir. Sou'-sou'west.

396
00:44:37,737 --> 00:44:40,198
Sail!

397
00:44:40,281 --> 00:44:43,493
Two points off starboard bow!

398
00:44:44,035 --> 00:44:46,496
Three cheers for Lucky Jack!

399
00:44:46,579 --> 00:44:51,459
(all) Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!

400
00:44:52,627 --> 00:44:55,004
She's ours, boys!

401
00:45:04,764 --> 00:45:08,935
- (Aubrey laughs)
- (Pullings) Foul! You got away before me.

402
00:45:13,106 --> 00:45:16,067
- Set royals and courses.
- Sir.

403
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:18,653
Have the idlers placed along the rails.

404
00:45:18,736 --> 00:45:20,697
I've never seen the Iike.

405
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:24,742
It has to be more than 100 sea miles
and he brings us up on his tail.

406
00:45:24,826 --> 00:45:28,997
That's seamanship, Mr Pullings.
My God, that's seamanship.

407
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:32,417
Told you it would work, Will.
We'II have them by nightfall.

408
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:36,004
- I think we've got him, sir.
- And the wind favours us this time.

409
00:45:36,087 --> 00:45:39,382
Don't count your eggs
before they're in the pudding.

410
00:45:39,465 --> 00:45:44,387
Still, if we can close this gap
and get up behind her, she may well be ours.

411
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:46,848
Touch wood. Scratch a stay.

412
00:45:47,473 --> 00:45:50,935
Turn three times.
May the Lord and saints preserve us.

413
00:46:06,534 --> 00:46:08,244
Turn!

414
00:46:08,328 --> 00:46:12,165
Move along, man.
We'II have Iost him before you rig it up!

415
00:46:12,248 --> 00:46:14,375
Hold!

416
00:46:15,168 --> 00:46:18,755
- 12 knots, sir.
- That's 12 knots. That's good.

417
00:46:18,838 --> 00:46:23,509
I want more. Have all the spare hands
placed on the windward rail.

418
00:46:23,593 --> 00:46:26,888
Mr Hollar. Rouse up the off-watch.

419
00:46:27,847 --> 00:46:31,184
AII hands on starboard rail!

420
00:46:31,851 --> 00:46:35,229
Come up the Iarboard topsail sheets!

421
00:46:52,872 --> 00:46:57,335
- We're crackin' on!
- We'II be crackin' up if he don't watch it!

422
00:46:57,418 --> 00:47:02,048
Captain knows this ship.
He knows what she can take.

423
00:47:05,385 --> 00:47:07,262
- Arh!
- Mr Hollar!

424
00:47:07,345 --> 00:47:10,640
Mr Hollar, I want Iifelines fore and aft!

425
00:47:10,723 --> 00:47:12,433
No Iounging, boy!

426
00:47:12,517 --> 00:47:18,231
(Hollar) Lifelines, fore and aft!
Double-grape that Iaunch!

427
00:47:20,441 --> 00:47:22,860
Cape Horn, Doctor.

428
00:47:38,668 --> 00:47:41,671
CIose the Iid.
There's enough water in the grog.

429
00:47:41,754 --> 00:47:43,631
Thank you for that, Davies.

430
00:47:43,715 --> 00:47:48,595
Reckon the captain will follow him
round the Horn, every stitch of canvas flying?

431
00:47:48,678 --> 00:47:51,139
I reckon he'd follow him to the gates of hell.

432
00:47:51,222 --> 00:47:55,768
It's a devil ship, I tell ya.
And it's Ieadin' us right into a trap.

433
00:47:59,147 --> 00:48:02,025
She's making a run for the Horn, sir.

434
00:48:02,108 --> 00:48:05,069
I'II not vouch for this mast.
Not around the Horn.

435
00:48:05,153 --> 00:48:08,197
Thank you. Your comments
will be noted in the Iog.

436
00:48:08,281 --> 00:48:14,537
Sail trimmers to their stations!
Get the sails off her, Iads. She's over-pressed.

437
00:48:14,621 --> 00:48:16,789
Give 'em a pull and belay!

438
00:48:32,263 --> 00:48:35,767
We're closing on her, Tom.
I'II not give up now.

439
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:39,103
Come up on the wind, Barret.
Set a course sou'west by west.

440
00:48:39,187 --> 00:48:41,814
Sou'west by west, sir.

441
00:48:42,982 --> 00:48:44,692
Mr Calamy.

442
00:48:44,776 --> 00:48:47,487
Idlers and waisters below.

443
00:48:51,282 --> 00:48:54,077
We're for the Horn, boys!

444
00:48:58,039 --> 00:48:59,999
CIose reef topsails!

445
00:49:13,513 --> 00:49:15,265
Lively, Iads!

446
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:24,357
Batten down those hatches
before we're on the bottom!

447
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:36,744
Johansson, Truelove! To the mizzen!

448
00:49:38,162 --> 00:49:40,081
AII secure.

449
00:49:40,164 --> 00:49:42,125
Down ye go, Iads.

450
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:53,303
Mr Hollom, help young Warley
on the mizzen topgallant.

451
00:49:56,764 --> 00:50:00,143
- I'II need more men, sir.
- Yes. Go.

452
00:50:08,484 --> 00:50:12,196
Mr Hollom, sir! Help me!

453
00:50:18,995 --> 00:50:22,665
Tudor, EIIers! To Mr AIIen!

454
00:50:22,749 --> 00:50:27,754
You men, Iay aloft.
The mizzen topgallant. Light along!

455
00:50:32,759 --> 00:50:34,969
(moans)

456
00:50:35,678 --> 00:50:37,764
Help!

457
00:50:40,808 --> 00:50:42,852
Help me!

458
00:50:48,733 --> 00:50:51,486
Man overboard!

459
00:50:52,654 --> 00:50:57,158
Mizzen's gone! Hands to the taffrail!

460
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:08,169
(Warleyyells)

461
00:51:08,253 --> 00:51:11,130
He's over there, sir!

462
00:51:11,214 --> 00:51:14,884
Swim for the wreckage, man!
Swim, man!

463
00:51:15,677 --> 00:51:17,387
Over here!

464
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:22,767
Mr AIIen, gratings and barrels,
anything that floats, overboard.

465
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:26,980
She's broaching! We're Iosing her!

466
00:51:27,063 --> 00:51:30,400
Sir, the wreckage is acting as a sea anchor!

467
00:51:30,483 --> 00:51:34,028
We must cut it Ioose!
It's going to sink us!

468
00:51:34,112 --> 00:51:37,949
Sir, he's going to make it! He can do it!

469
00:51:38,032 --> 00:51:42,078
- Come on, Will!
- Come on! Hand over hand!

470
00:51:42,161 --> 00:51:47,333
For God's sake, Will, swim!
Swim for the wreckage, Will!

471
00:51:55,967 --> 00:51:57,885
(Nagle) You can do it, Will!

472
00:51:57,969 --> 00:52:02,140
- Swim! Come on!
- Come on, Will! Swim!

473
00:52:55,026 --> 00:52:57,987
(cheering)

474
00:54:25,617 --> 00:54:28,369
(thunder)

475
00:54:31,789 --> 00:54:35,209
- He's been at it again.
- Who's that, then?

476
00:54:35,293 --> 00:54:38,087
- The Jonah.
- What's that?

477
00:54:38,171 --> 00:54:39,923
(thunderclap)

478
00:54:48,514 --> 00:54:52,977
The deaths in actual battle
are the easiest to bear.

479
00:54:53,686 --> 00:55:00,735
For my own part, those who die under my
knife, or from some subsequent infection...

480
00:55:00,818 --> 00:55:06,741
I have to remind myself that it was
the enemy that killed them, not me.

481
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:11,537
That young man was a casualty of war.

482
00:55:14,249 --> 00:55:18,503
As you said yourself,
you have to choose the Iesser of two evils.

483
00:55:18,586 --> 00:55:20,672
Weevils.

484
00:55:24,092 --> 00:55:28,513
The crew will take it badly.
Warley was popular.

485
00:55:28,596 --> 00:55:32,684
Have they expressed
any feelings on the matter to you?

486
00:55:39,941 --> 00:55:42,986
Jack, before answering,
I'm compelled to ask,

487
00:55:43,069 --> 00:55:47,198
am I speaking with my old friend
or to the ship's captain?

488
00:55:48,283 --> 00:55:51,911
To the captain I'd say
there's Iittle I detest more than an informer.

489
00:55:51,995 --> 00:55:55,248
- Now you're talking Iike an Irishman.
- I am an Irishman.

490
00:55:55,331 --> 00:55:57,375
Well, as a friend, then.

491
00:55:57,458 --> 00:56:03,298
As a friend, I would say that I have never once
doubted your abilities as a captain.

492
00:56:03,381 --> 00:56:05,300
Speak plainly, Stephen.

493
00:56:07,093 --> 00:56:11,806
Perhaps we should have
turned back weeks ago.

494
00:56:11,889 --> 00:56:15,768
The men... of course
they would follow Lucky Jack anywhere,

495
00:56:15,852 --> 00:56:18,104
rightfully confident of victory.

496
00:56:18,187 --> 00:56:23,818
But therein Iies the problem.
You're not accustomed to defeat.

497
00:56:25,361 --> 00:56:31,576
And chasing this Iarger, faster ship with
its Iong guns is beginning to smack of pride.

498
00:56:31,659 --> 00:56:35,079
It's not a question of pride.
It is a question of duty.

499
00:56:35,163 --> 00:56:37,624
Duty. Yes, I've heard it well spoken of.

500
00:56:37,707 --> 00:56:42,337
Be as satiric as you Iike. Viewing the world
through a microscope is your prerogative.

501
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:46,966
This is a ship of war. I will grind whatever
grist the mill requires to fulfil my duty.

502
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:49,427
Whatever the cost?

503
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:51,763
Whatever the cost.

504
00:56:51,846 --> 00:56:54,641
To follow orders with no regard for cost.

505
00:56:54,724 --> 00:56:59,020
Can you really claim there's
nothing personal in this call to duty?

506
00:56:59,103 --> 00:57:01,606
Orders are subject
to the requirement of the service.

507
00:57:01,689 --> 00:57:07,987
My orders were to follow him as far as Brazil.
I exceeded my orders a Iong time ago.

508
00:57:10,198 --> 00:57:12,283
Got it.

509
00:57:15,828 --> 00:57:18,831
The wind's backing, sir.

510
00:57:18,915 --> 00:57:22,961
Sir, we just can't hold
this westerly course any Ionger.

511
00:57:23,544 --> 00:57:29,592
If we can't sail through the damn wind, Tom,
we'II bloody well sail around it. Due south.

512
00:57:29,676 --> 00:57:32,679
How far south, sir?

513
00:57:32,762 --> 00:57:36,307
As far as is necessary, Mr Pullings.

514
00:57:36,391 --> 00:57:38,851
- Aye, sir.
- Lively!

515
00:57:39,936 --> 00:57:44,107
- Due south, please, Mr Bonden.
- Due south, sir.

516
00:57:46,651 --> 00:57:49,821
Heave! Steady!

517
00:58:18,933 --> 00:58:20,310
(officers) Ahh...

518
00:58:20,893 --> 00:58:23,605
Hurray!

519
00:58:25,106 --> 00:58:29,444
CIearly something nautical and fascinating
just happened. I am at a Ioss.

520
00:58:29,527 --> 00:58:34,032
We have made our turn northward.
We are headed back toward the sun.

521
00:58:34,115 --> 00:58:36,200
- To the sun.
- To the sun!

522
00:58:38,828 --> 00:58:42,457
Oh, and by way of anticipation of this event,

523
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:48,171
I have asked Killick
to prepare something special.

524
00:58:48,254 --> 00:58:52,550
- Killick! Killick there...
- I'm already here, ain't I?

525
00:58:55,053 --> 00:58:59,265
Gentlemen, I give you...

526
00:59:00,058 --> 00:59:02,352
our destination.

527
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:12,403
- It's the Galapagos Islands!
- The Galapagos Islands!

528
00:59:14,989 --> 00:59:17,283
Our whaling fleet is there.

529
00:59:17,367 --> 00:59:22,830
And their cargo would put a pretty penny
into old Bones-aparte's invasion purse.

530
00:59:22,914 --> 00:59:28,628
That's where the Acheron will be.
Sure as there's carts to horses.

531
00:59:28,711 --> 00:59:31,422
So, Mr Pullings, if you'II permit me...

532
00:59:31,464 --> 00:59:34,467
a slice of AIbemarle.

533
00:59:35,426 --> 00:59:39,055
And for you, Doctor, Redondo Rock.

534
00:59:39,138 --> 00:59:40,473
Perfect.

535
00:59:40,556 --> 00:59:43,309
And the Acheron... for me.

536
00:59:49,482 --> 00:59:54,737
(Allen) ? Safe and sound at home again
Let the waters roar, Jack

537
00:59:54,821 --> 00:59:59,784
? Safe and sound at home again
Let the waters roar, Jack

538
00:59:59,867 --> 01:00:06,124
? Long we tossed on the rolling main
Now we're safe ashore, Jack

539
01:00:06,207 --> 01:00:11,588
? Don't forget your old shipmates
Folly-rolly-rolly-rolly-rye-o!

540
01:00:11,629 --> 01:00:17,051
? We have worked the selfsame gun
Quarterdeck division

541
01:00:17,135 --> 01:00:22,807
? Sponger I, and Ioader you
Through the whole commission

542
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:29,272
? Long we tossed on the rolling main
Now we're safe ashore, Jack

543
01:00:29,355 --> 01:00:36,613
? Don't forget your old shipmates
Folly-rolly-rolly-rolly-rye-o!

544
01:00:36,696 --> 01:00:38,781
(laughter)

545
01:01:18,071 --> 01:01:20,823
Las Encantadas.

546
01:01:20,907 --> 01:01:27,747
The Enchanted Isles. They're said
to be full of strange and wonderful beasts.

547
01:01:28,581 --> 01:01:31,668
When we get there,
we'II have to stop for food and water.

548
01:01:31,751 --> 01:01:35,713
I promise you, during that time -
several days at Ieast -

549
01:01:35,797 --> 01:01:40,218
you can wander at will, collecting bugs
and beetles to your heart's content.

550
01:01:40,301 --> 01:01:44,806
You'II be the first naturalist
to set foot on the islands, I'II wager.

551
01:01:44,889 --> 01:01:48,268
Well, I would Iike that of all things.

552
01:01:51,896 --> 01:01:55,149
- Is it an insect?
- Yes.

553
01:01:56,985 --> 01:02:01,823
Doesn't Iook Iike one.
I mean, it Iooks Iike a stick.

554
01:02:02,615 --> 01:02:04,993
Yes, that's the whole point.

555
01:02:05,076 --> 01:02:09,038
It's disguised itself in order to survive.

556
01:02:13,042 --> 01:02:17,714
See, there's a spider
that's disguised itself as an ant.

557
01:02:17,797 --> 01:02:25,096
And here's an insect that's taken on the shape
of a thorn to save itself from the birds.

558
01:02:26,598 --> 01:02:28,808
Did God make them change?

559
01:02:28,891 --> 01:02:32,270
Does God make them change?
Yes, certainly.

560
01:02:32,353 --> 01:02:35,815
But do they also change themselves?

561
01:02:35,898 --> 01:02:38,693
Now that is a question, isn't it?

562
01:02:40,778 --> 01:02:43,489
Sir! Sir, we've raised the Galapagos!

563
01:02:43,531 --> 01:02:45,617
I'm coming!

564
01:03:20,485 --> 01:03:24,280
- Look. Beyond the rock.
- Oh, yes, I see.

565
01:03:24,364 --> 01:03:28,034
What is it? Curious, eh?
Some type of gull?

566
01:03:28,117 --> 01:03:33,581
- There's an ugly devil.
- Disgusting! It's got warts all over it.

567
01:03:33,665 --> 01:03:36,626
Ugly devils, aren't they?

568
01:03:37,585 --> 01:03:40,296
I can't see any women.
Just ducks and Iizards.

569
01:03:40,338 --> 01:03:43,258
What, no women? It ain't natural.

570
01:03:44,592 --> 01:03:46,469
How extraordinary.

571
01:03:46,552 --> 01:03:48,388
What is, sir?

572
01:03:48,471 --> 01:03:52,517
Those birds. They're a species of cormorant,
but they are flightless.

573
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:55,311
Do you see their underdeveloped wings?

574
01:03:55,353 --> 01:03:58,940
By all that's holy,
I think that's unknown to science.

575
01:03:59,023 --> 01:04:02,819
The dragons don't seem to bother them.

576
01:04:03,444 --> 01:04:07,907
No. They're a type of iguana, I should think.
Therefore, they're vegetarian.

577
01:04:07,991 --> 01:04:11,077
- Will you catch one?
- A pair of them, I should think.

578
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:14,372
Then you can present
one of their offspring to the king.

579
01:04:14,455 --> 01:04:18,167
- Look. There's one going for a swim.
- Iguanas don't swim.

580
01:04:18,251 --> 01:04:20,503
These ones do.

581
01:04:29,554 --> 01:04:31,681
Well, I'II be damned.

582
01:04:31,764 --> 01:04:38,021
Two new species in as many minutes.
That's remarkable.

583
01:05:01,419 --> 01:05:06,382
AII hands about ship! Off tacks and sheets!
Prepare the mainsail to haul!

584
01:05:15,642 --> 01:05:19,228
- Aubrey.
- Hogg. Master of the Albatross.

585
01:05:19,312 --> 01:05:22,774
God bless you, Captain.
God bless you all.

586
01:05:23,775 --> 01:05:26,736
- Mr Calamy, food and water for these men.
- Aye, sir.

587
01:05:26,819 --> 01:05:30,281
- Mr Howard, stand your men down.
- Royal Marines, trail arms!

588
01:05:31,157 --> 01:05:34,202
We was coming back for fresh Iines
no more than a week ago.

589
01:05:34,285 --> 01:05:39,749
Hid in that inlet yonder. Burnt our bloody
ship to the waterline. Fucking pirates!

590
01:05:39,832 --> 01:05:42,126
Crew prisoner, captain dead.

591
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:46,339
She were a big black three-master.
Break your heart, it would.

592
01:05:46,422 --> 01:05:51,636
¡ê12,000 sterling of the finest grade oil they
took. We been out more than two years, see.

593
01:05:51,719 --> 01:05:53,638
And her course?

594
01:05:53,721 --> 01:05:56,891
Maybe a point south of west,
following the rest of the fleet.

595
01:05:56,975 --> 01:06:00,186
Mr Pullings, enter these men's names
into the ship's books.

596
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:03,481
Mr AIIen, set a course. West by south.

597
01:06:03,564 --> 01:06:05,817
AII hands, make sail!

598
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:08,945
Sir, should we not take on fresh provisions?

599
01:06:09,028 --> 01:06:12,156
Mr Mowett, there's not a moment to Iose.

600
01:06:27,297 --> 01:06:32,343
- Jack, have you forgotten your promise?
- Subject to the requirements of the service.

601
01:06:32,427 --> 01:06:35,638
I cannot delay for the sake
of an iguana or a giant peccary.

602
01:06:35,722 --> 01:06:39,183
Fascinating, no doubt,
but of no immediate application.

603
01:06:39,267 --> 01:06:43,313
There is, I think, an opportunity here
to serve both our purposes.

604
01:06:43,396 --> 01:06:46,524
As I understand it, this is a Iong, thin island.

605
01:06:46,608 --> 01:06:50,153
You need to sail around it.
I could walk across it.

606
01:06:50,236 --> 01:06:54,157
I have known you to spend hours
staring into a deserted bird's nest.

607
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:58,202
I could walk briskly, pausing only
for important measurements.

608
01:06:58,286 --> 01:07:02,457
Making discoveries that could advance
our knowledge of natural history.

609
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:06,628
If wind and tide had been against us,
I should have said yes.

610
01:07:06,711 --> 01:07:09,923
They're not. I'm obliged to say no.

611
01:07:11,591 --> 01:07:15,303
Oh, I see.
So after all this time in your service,

612
01:07:15,386 --> 01:07:20,266
I must simply content myself
to form part of this belligerent expedition,

613
01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:25,355
hurry past wonders, bent on destruction.
I say nothing of the corruption of power...

614
01:07:25,438 --> 01:07:29,025
- You forget yourself, Doctor.
- No, Jack, no.

615
01:07:29,108 --> 01:07:33,404
You've forgotten yourself. For my part,
I look upon a promise as binding.

616
01:07:33,488 --> 01:07:37,825
The promise was conditional.
I command a king's ship, not a private yacht!

617
01:07:37,909 --> 01:07:42,038
We do not have time for
your damned hobbies, sir!

618
01:08:09,983 --> 01:08:12,443
All right. All right.

619
01:08:14,404 --> 01:08:19,993
Get those fish below.
Sluice down this deck.

620
01:08:20,076 --> 01:08:23,329
(Calamy) Davies, don't leave them there.
Get them below.

621
01:08:23,413 --> 01:08:25,081
Mr Blakeney.

622
01:08:25,164 --> 01:08:29,377
Sir, I found a curious beetle
walking along the deck.

623
01:08:32,589 --> 01:08:35,425
I think it's a Galapagos beetle.

624
01:08:36,467 --> 01:08:38,219
I'm sure of it.

625
01:08:39,387 --> 01:08:44,601
Were you to walk all day on the island,
you might never come across it.

626
01:08:46,769 --> 01:08:50,106
Yes, that is more than likely sure.

627
01:08:50,857 --> 01:08:53,276
You can have it, sir.

628
01:09:09,667 --> 01:09:12,253
Mr Blakeney.

629
01:09:13,463 --> 01:09:16,466
- Thank you.
- Sir.

630
01:09:29,938 --> 01:09:31,940
Last gun fired, sir.

631
01:09:32,023 --> 01:09:35,652
- Timing?
- Two minutes and one second, sir.

632
01:09:35,735 --> 01:09:41,115
Lads, that's not good enough.
We need to fire two broadsides to her one.

633
01:09:41,157 --> 01:09:44,369
- Want to see a guillotine in Piccadilly?
- (all) No!

634
01:09:44,452 --> 01:09:47,664
- Do you want to call Napoleon your king?
- No!

635
01:09:47,747 --> 01:09:50,500
- Want your children to sing The Marseillaise?
- No!

636
01:09:50,583 --> 01:09:53,795
Mr Mowett, Mr Pullings, starboard battery!

637
01:09:53,878 --> 01:09:56,297
(cheering and shouting)

638
01:09:56,881 --> 01:10:00,176
Jump to it, lads. Cadence and rhythm.

639
01:10:02,845 --> 01:10:06,182
- Mark your targets!
- Come on, lads, faster now!

640
01:10:06,266 --> 01:10:08,351
Come on, swab it!

641
01:10:20,154 --> 01:10:22,574
Heave!

642
01:10:22,657 --> 01:10:25,868
- Report, Mr Mowett.
- Third and fourth divisions ready.

643
01:10:25,952 --> 01:10:28,830
Right. Starboard battery, fire!

644
01:10:31,124 --> 01:10:33,543
(cannon fire and shouting)

645
01:10:37,714 --> 01:10:40,174
(lull in cannon fire)

646
01:10:48,057 --> 01:10:51,019
(cannon fire restarts)

647
01:11:02,697 --> 01:11:04,908
One minute and ten seconds!

648
01:11:04,991 --> 01:11:06,659
(all) Huzzah!

649
01:11:06,743 --> 01:11:09,454
Well done, lads.
Extra grog for all of you.

650
01:11:09,495 --> 01:11:11,623
Huzzah!

651
01:11:13,541 --> 01:11:16,002
Gangway for the captain, lads.

652
01:11:16,085 --> 01:11:18,796
Marked improvement, Mr Calamy. Well done.

653
01:11:18,838 --> 01:11:20,924
Thank you, sir.

654
01:11:27,305 --> 01:11:32,727
Killick! Killick there!
What do you have for us tonight?

655
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:35,355
- Which it's soused hog's face.
- Eh?

656
01:11:35,438 --> 01:11:40,109
- Which it is soused hog's face!
- My favourite. My favourite.

657
01:11:40,193 --> 01:11:46,783
(Mowett) And when they run,
the Surprise will blow her to kingdom come!

658
01:11:46,866 --> 01:11:48,952
(laughter)

659
01:12:43,172 --> 01:12:46,551
One more week of this and
they'd give it up for a cup of water.

660
01:12:46,634 --> 01:12:48,803
I can't make it rain.

661
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:54,225
I can harness the wind,
but I ain't its goddamn creator.

662
01:12:54,309 --> 01:12:56,895
I have never known such a run of bad luck.

663
01:13:13,328 --> 01:13:19,250
"And they said unto him
'For what caused the evil?"'

664
01:13:20,752 --> 01:13:23,004
(laughter)

665
01:13:23,087 --> 01:13:25,423
Where'd that come from?

666
01:13:26,341 --> 01:13:31,262
It's from the Bible, that. That is
from the Bible. The story of the Jonah.

667
01:13:31,346 --> 01:13:35,225
They found out on their ship
that one of their men - this Jonah cove -

668
01:13:35,308 --> 01:13:38,353
he'd offended God
and was the cause of all their bad luck.

669
01:13:38,436 --> 01:13:44,067
Evil comes... from him
who evil thinks and evil is.

670
01:13:44,150 --> 01:13:48,863
- (sniggering)
- No, no. Joe knows a thing or two about evil.

671
01:13:49,739 --> 01:13:53,409
From personal experience. Right, Joe?

672
01:14:05,129 --> 01:14:10,552
It's like Killick says. Morning of the battle,
he doesn't have the guts to beat to quarters.

673
01:14:10,635 --> 01:14:15,265
Then his entire gun crew's killed.
Soon as he went up the mizzen, Will falls.

674
01:14:15,348 --> 01:14:19,143
And whose watch was it
when we lost our wind?

675
01:14:41,499 --> 01:14:44,127
You there! Stand fast!

676
01:14:46,254 --> 01:14:50,425
Master-at-arms, take that man below
and clap him in irons.

677
01:14:50,508 --> 01:14:54,053
Mr Pullings, defaulters at eight bells.

678
01:14:54,137 --> 01:14:55,847
Aye, sir.

679
01:14:57,265 --> 01:15:00,602
Bring Hollom down to my cabin.

680
01:15:04,606 --> 01:15:07,901
A man pushed past you,
yet you said nothing. Why?

681
01:15:07,984 --> 01:15:10,904
I intended to, sir, but the right words didn't...

682
01:15:10,987 --> 01:15:16,200
The right words?
He was deliberately insubordinate.

683
01:15:16,284 --> 01:15:19,370
I've tried to get to know the men, sir,
and be friendly,

684
01:15:19,454 --> 01:15:22,916
but they've taken a set against me.

685
01:15:23,583 --> 01:15:28,421
Always whispering when I go past
and giving me looks.

686
01:15:28,504 --> 01:15:31,424
I'll set that to rights.
I'll be much tougher on them.

687
01:15:31,507 --> 01:15:35,053
You don't make friends
with the foremast jacks, lad.

688
01:15:35,136 --> 01:15:39,432
They'll despise you in the end,
think you weak.

689
01:15:39,515 --> 01:15:43,228
- Nor do you need to be a tyrant.
- No, sir.

690
01:15:43,311 --> 01:15:45,605
I'm very sorry, sir.

691
01:15:45,688 --> 01:15:49,108
- You're, what? 26, 27?
- I'm 30 next Friday, sir.

692
01:15:49,192 --> 01:15:50,777
30?

693
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:54,113
You've failed to pass for lieutenant twice.

694
01:15:54,197 --> 01:15:59,077
I know you have, but you're not a bad sailor.
You can't spend your life a midshipman.

695
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:02,789
No, sir. I will try much harder, sir.

696
01:16:04,332 --> 01:16:07,752
Look, Hollom, it's leadership they want.

697
01:16:07,835 --> 01:16:09,879
Strength.

698
01:16:09,963 --> 01:16:15,426
Now, you find that within yourself,
and you will earn their respect.

699
01:16:17,011 --> 01:16:20,598
Without respect,
true discipline goes by the board.

700
01:16:21,683 --> 01:16:24,477
Yes, sir. Um...

701
01:16:24,561 --> 01:16:29,649
Strength, respect... and discipline, sir.

702
01:16:33,570 --> 01:16:37,532
Well... it's an unfortunate business, Hollom.

703
01:16:38,533 --> 01:16:41,369
Damned unfortunate.

704
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:44,998
- That'll be all.
- Yes, sir.

705
01:16:48,251 --> 01:16:51,212
- I am not a flogging captain.
- (Stephen) Hollom is a scapegoat

706
01:16:51,296 --> 01:16:55,633
for all the bad luck,
real or imagined, on this voyage.

707
01:16:55,717 --> 01:16:58,261
Mr Lamb? If you please.

708
01:16:58,344 --> 01:17:01,598
(Stephen) They're exhausted.
These men are exhausted.

709
01:17:01,681 --> 01:17:04,559
You've pushed them too hard.

710
01:17:04,642 --> 01:17:08,313
Stephen, I invite you
to this cabin as my friend.

711
01:17:08,396 --> 01:17:12,692
Not to criticise nor to comment
on my command.

712
01:17:12,775 --> 01:17:18,323
Well, shall I leave you until
you're in a more harmonious frame of mind?

713
01:17:19,574 --> 01:17:23,369
- What would you have me do?
- Tip the ship's grog over the side.

714
01:17:23,453 --> 01:17:26,915
- Stop their grog?
- Nagle was drunk when he insulted Hollom.

715
01:17:26,998 --> 01:17:30,293
Stop 200 years of privilege and tradition.

716
01:17:30,376 --> 01:17:33,546
I'd rather have them three sheets to the wind
than face a mutiny.

717
01:17:33,630 --> 01:17:35,924
I'm rather understanding of mutinies.

718
01:17:36,007 --> 01:17:40,845
Men pressed from their homes, confined
for months aboard a wooden prison...

719
01:17:40,929 --> 01:17:47,727
I respect your right to disagree with me,
but I can only afford one rebel on this ship.

720
01:17:49,145 --> 01:17:53,441
I hate it when you talk of the service
in this way. It makes me so very low.

721
01:17:53,524 --> 01:17:55,276
You think I want to flog Nagle?

722
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:58,947
A man who hacked the ropes
that sent his mate to his death?

723
01:17:59,030 --> 01:18:01,908
Under my orders?

724
01:18:01,991 --> 01:18:06,329
Do you not see? The only things that keep
this wooden world together are hard work...

725
01:18:06,412 --> 01:18:08,831
Jack, the man failed to salute.

726
01:18:08,915 --> 01:18:11,626
There's hierarchies even in nature.

727
01:18:11,709 --> 01:18:16,965
- There is no disdain in nature. There is no...
- Men must be governed!

728
01:18:17,048 --> 01:18:19,592
Often not wisely, but governed nonetheless.

729
01:18:19,676 --> 01:18:23,972
That's the excuse of every tyrant in history,
from Nero to Bonaparte.

730
01:18:24,055 --> 01:18:28,184
I, for one, am opposed to authority.
It is an egg of misery and oppression.

731
01:18:28,268 --> 01:18:32,730
You've come to the wrong shop
for anarchy, brother.

732
01:18:35,567 --> 01:18:37,402
Four.

733
01:18:38,861 --> 01:18:40,238
Five.

734
01:18:42,532 --> 01:18:44,200
Six.

735
01:18:45,451 --> 01:18:47,245
Seven.

736
01:18:48,496 --> 01:18:50,039
Eight.

737
01:18:50,748 --> 01:18:52,500
Nine.

738
01:18:54,878 --> 01:18:56,754
Ten.

739
01:18:57,839 --> 01:18:59,048
Eleven.

740
01:19:01,092 --> 01:19:03,052
Twelve.

741
01:19:06,055 --> 01:19:08,266
(Pullings) Cut him down.

742
01:19:28,244 --> 01:19:30,330
(whispering)

743
01:19:32,206 --> 01:19:34,584
Shh. Not so loud.

744
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:38,087
(whispering continues)

745
01:20:28,721 --> 01:20:31,432
Oh, put that dirk down, Boyle.

746
01:20:33,893 --> 01:20:36,479
- (gasps)
- You OK, Mr Hollom?

747
01:20:36,563 --> 01:20:39,649
- He's not ill, just dodging work as usual.
- Shut up!

748
01:20:39,732 --> 01:20:42,819
- You shut up.
- Just leave him be.

749
01:20:42,902 --> 01:20:45,905
- Have some water.
- Oh, thank you.

750
01:20:50,118 --> 01:20:52,453
Sir. Sir, it's Mr Hollom.

751
01:20:59,586 --> 01:21:05,550
There's nothing physically wrong with him.
He thinks he's been cursed.

752
01:21:07,302 --> 01:21:11,014
Sailors can abide a great deal,
but not a Jonah.

753
01:21:11,681 --> 01:21:14,767
My God. You believe it too.

754
01:21:16,436 --> 01:21:19,898
Not everything is in your books, Stephen.

755
01:21:26,404 --> 01:21:28,323
It's him, innit?

756
01:21:30,909 --> 01:21:33,912
The Jonah.

757
01:21:33,995 --> 01:21:35,997
He's causing it.

758
01:21:38,499 --> 01:21:41,753
He's callin' it up, don't you see?

759
01:21:41,836 --> 01:21:46,507
Every time he's on watch, that ship appears.

760
01:21:49,969 --> 01:21:52,680
You wait and see.

761
01:21:52,722 --> 01:21:57,727
Any time tonight,
that ghost ship's gonna turn up.

762
01:21:58,895 --> 01:22:03,691
And it's gonna take us all with it,
straight down to the hot place.

763
01:22:21,334 --> 01:22:22,377
(gasps)

764
01:22:24,379 --> 01:22:26,714
Mr Hollom.

765
01:22:26,798 --> 01:22:29,509
You gave me such a start.

766
01:22:31,970 --> 01:22:34,138
Are you feeling better now?

767
01:22:34,222 --> 01:22:37,767
Yes. Much better, thank you.

768
01:22:49,070 --> 01:22:53,449
The captain thinks
we'll get our wind tomorrow.

769
01:22:53,533 --> 01:22:55,618
I'm sure of it.

770
01:23:24,564 --> 01:23:28,109
You've always been very kind to me.

771
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:37,619
Goodbye, Blakeney.

772
01:24:07,899 --> 01:24:10,902
(bell tolls)

773
01:24:45,895 --> 01:24:50,692
The simple truth is, not all of us become
the men we once hoped we might be.

774
01:24:50,775 --> 01:24:53,736
But we are all God's creatures.

775
01:24:56,489 --> 01:25:00,827
If there are those among us
who thought ill of Mr Hollom,

776
01:25:01,744 --> 01:25:04,455
or spoke ill of him,

777
01:25:06,165 --> 01:25:09,794
or failed him in respect of fellowship...

778
01:25:11,045 --> 01:25:14,591
then we ask for your forgiveness, Lord.

779
01:25:14,674 --> 01:25:16,843
And we ask for his.

780
01:25:32,609 --> 01:25:35,194
God be praised. Mr Mowett?

781
01:25:46,664 --> 01:25:50,084
(exuberant shouting)

782
01:26:00,553 --> 01:26:03,014
Avast there!

783
01:26:16,736 --> 01:26:19,864
- Doctor, have you seen the bird?
- What sort of bird?

784
01:26:19,948 --> 01:26:26,913
Some sort of albatross. Either that, or
he's a prodigious great mew. There it goes.

785
01:26:33,253 --> 01:26:37,173
There he is. My bird, my bird. Damn!

786
01:26:37,257 --> 01:26:40,802
- (laughter)
- It's circling, lads!

787
01:26:47,934 --> 01:26:48,977
Doctor?

788
01:26:49,060 --> 01:26:51,396
My God! Doctor! Doctor!

789
01:26:52,814 --> 01:26:57,652
I'm so sorry, man.
The bird dropped low. I didn't see you.

790
01:27:00,363 --> 01:27:03,616
- Calamy, get Higgins.
- I'm fine, Jack.

791
01:27:17,130 --> 01:27:19,924
The bullet took in a piece of shirt with it.

792
01:27:20,008 --> 01:27:25,054
Unless it's removed,
it's gonna suppurate and fester.

793
01:27:25,138 --> 01:27:27,098
Are you equal to the task?

794
01:27:27,181 --> 01:27:33,271
Well, I'll need to read up on the doctor's
books, like. Study some pictures he has.

795
01:27:33,354 --> 01:27:35,273
Study some pictures?

796
01:27:35,356 --> 01:27:38,443
It's just to get my bearings, that's all.

797
01:27:38,526 --> 01:27:45,158
Well, it'd be a lot easier if I were on dry land.
You know, you wouldn't have the...

798
01:27:45,241 --> 01:27:47,744
I'll manage. You'll see.

799
01:28:12,185 --> 01:28:15,897
Sail on the horizon, sir. Running west.

800
01:28:16,439 --> 01:28:19,317
We're not sure, but we think it's her, sir.

801
01:28:23,238 --> 01:28:25,240
Better get...

802
01:28:26,616 --> 01:28:28,701
Goodbye, sir.

803
01:28:46,970 --> 01:28:51,057
(Allen) No mistakin' it. She's the Frenchie.

804
01:28:58,606 --> 01:29:01,776
Shall we beat to quarters, sir?

805
01:29:40,189 --> 01:29:42,692
Tell me this wasn't on my account.

806
01:29:42,775 --> 01:29:47,906
No, not at all.
I just needed to stretch my legs.

807
01:29:49,616 --> 01:29:52,035
Gently there.

808
01:29:58,791 --> 01:30:02,587
Briskly now. Secure this line.

809
01:30:02,670 --> 01:30:05,965
Royal Marines posted every 20 yards, sir.

810
01:30:17,018 --> 01:30:19,604
- All set, Higgins?
- Yes, sir.

811
01:30:19,687 --> 01:30:22,106
No.

812
01:30:22,690 --> 01:30:25,693
I do this with my own hand.

813
01:30:31,157 --> 01:30:34,244
If everything is under control,
I'll just be outside.

814
01:30:34,327 --> 01:30:37,413
(Stephen) A spare pair of steady hands
wouldn't go amiss.

815
01:30:37,497 --> 01:30:43,002
That is, if, of course, you have
the constitution for this kind of thing.

816
01:30:43,378 --> 01:30:51,302
My dear doctor, I have been amongst
and around wounds all my life.

817
01:30:51,844 --> 01:30:54,013
Well, good, then.

818
01:30:54,097 --> 01:30:56,641
Put your hand on my belly,

819
01:30:56,724 --> 01:30:59,185
pressing firmly when I give the word.

820
01:30:59,269 --> 01:31:02,730
Higgins, the catling, if you please.

821
01:31:10,196 --> 01:31:12,448
Padeen, please.

822
01:31:25,712 --> 01:31:28,214
The sounder, Mr Higgins.

823
01:31:29,591 --> 01:31:31,676
Swab.

824
01:31:41,728 --> 01:31:43,813
All right.

825
01:31:46,733 --> 01:31:49,986
Mr Higgins, you'll have to raise the rib.

826
01:31:52,780 --> 01:31:57,035
Take a good grip... with the square retractor.

827
01:32:00,496 --> 01:32:02,707
Right in.

828
01:32:02,790 --> 01:32:04,751
And lift up.

829
01:32:04,834 --> 01:32:06,294
Lift up.

830
01:32:07,962 --> 01:32:09,797
(whimpers)

831
01:32:19,390 --> 01:32:21,976
Swab, Jack. I can't see.

832
01:32:26,356 --> 01:32:29,400
Are you all right?

833
01:32:39,369 --> 01:32:41,454
I got it.

834
01:32:53,091 --> 01:32:55,385
A tad more pressure.

835
01:33:06,229 --> 01:33:08,940
- Is that all of it?
- Aye, sir.

836
01:33:09,649 --> 01:33:11,859
She'll patch up nicely.

837
01:33:11,943 --> 01:33:13,861
Thank God I got it.

838
01:33:44,475 --> 01:33:47,228
(shouting)

839
01:33:59,657 --> 01:34:01,492
Oh, that's good.

840
01:34:09,125 --> 01:34:10,919
Sir! Sir!

841
01:34:11,002 --> 01:34:14,839
- Padeen and I have been collecting for you.
- Have you really?

842
01:34:14,923 --> 01:34:18,551
The beetles each come with a specimen
of the plant they were found on.

843
01:34:18,635 --> 01:34:21,095
Padeen, that one's got away.

844
01:34:21,179 --> 01:34:25,433
Sir, I've made a few notes,
if you want to see them.

845
01:34:41,449 --> 01:34:45,495
Mr Blakeney, it would appear that
you have the makings of a naturalist.

846
01:34:45,578 --> 01:34:52,460
Well, sir, perhaps I could combine them to be
a sort of... fighting naturalist, like you, sir.

847
01:34:52,544 --> 01:34:54,587
(chuckles)

848
01:34:54,671 --> 01:34:58,007
They don't combine too well, I find.

849
01:34:58,091 --> 01:34:59,133
Right.

850
01:34:59,217 --> 01:35:01,594
Should you really be getting up, sir?

851
01:35:01,678 --> 01:35:05,139
- Mr Blakeney, are you also a doctor?
- No, sir.

852
01:35:05,223 --> 01:35:08,643
No, you're not. Padeen, if you please.

853
01:35:15,108 --> 01:35:19,529
How long does the captain
intend that we stay? Do you know?

854
01:35:21,406 --> 01:35:23,866
- Oh, a week perhaps.
- A week?

855
01:35:23,950 --> 01:35:27,996
- There's no great hurry.
- Mustn't we make haste for the Marquesas?

856
01:35:28,079 --> 01:35:30,999
I'm not even sure
it was the Acheron we sighted.

857
01:35:31,082 --> 01:35:36,129
And if it was, she'll be well away by now.
Like looking for an honest man in parliament.

858
01:35:36,212 --> 01:35:41,342
No, we shall head home. Before peace
breaks out with France, God forbid.

859
01:35:44,971 --> 01:35:48,391
I fear you may have burdened me
with a debt I can never repay.

860
01:35:48,474 --> 01:35:53,688
Tosh. Name a shrub after me.
Something prickly and hard to eradicate.

861
01:35:53,771 --> 01:35:58,443
A shrub? Nonsense.
I'll name a great tortoise after you.

862
01:35:58,526 --> 01:36:01,321
Testudo aubreii.

863
01:36:12,207 --> 01:36:14,542
(sea lions bark)

864
01:36:34,187 --> 01:36:36,356
(sea lion growls)

865
01:36:42,987 --> 01:36:46,324
Come on, pack up your things.
We should be going.

866
01:36:46,407 --> 01:36:49,619
- Back to camp, sir?
- No, to the other side of the island.

867
01:36:49,702 --> 01:36:54,165
- But, sir, that must be at least ten miles.
- Then there's not a moment to lose.

868
01:36:54,249 --> 01:36:57,252
That's where I saw my flightless cormorant.

869
01:36:57,335 --> 01:36:59,254
Come on.

870
01:37:10,181 --> 01:37:13,142
Seven inches in length.

871
01:37:14,143 --> 01:37:16,187
Four inches wide.

872
01:37:16,271 --> 01:37:18,773
15-inches-long neck.

873
01:37:19,857 --> 01:37:24,195
Width at the widest point... six inches.

874
01:37:30,243 --> 01:37:33,788
Padeen, put the net down
and use your hands. They won't bite.

875
01:37:33,872 --> 01:37:36,124
Here's a good one.

876
01:37:37,876 --> 01:37:40,628
Pick them up carefully.

877
01:37:41,254 --> 01:37:44,132
Sir, I think we should be getting back.

878
01:37:44,215 --> 01:37:49,721
Naval discipline doesn't operate out here,
Mr Blakeney. I must find that cormorant.

879
01:37:49,804 --> 01:37:52,515
And should it indeed prove flightless,

880
01:37:52,557 --> 01:37:56,394
you can join me at the Royal Society dinner
as co-discoverer.

881
01:38:07,071 --> 01:38:09,449
(bird cry)

882
01:38:36,392 --> 01:38:38,853
(quiet clicking)

883
01:39:20,144 --> 01:39:21,688
Mr Blakeney.

884
01:39:36,828 --> 01:39:39,122
Sir, we must hurry.

885
01:39:41,332 --> 01:39:47,046
Padeen, you must carry him. Put those down.
Leave them. Just put everything down.

886
01:39:50,550 --> 01:39:53,303
Open the cages.

887
01:40:07,734 --> 01:40:12,614
- All hands, unmoor ship!
- Mr Allen, I'll have her on a starboard tack.

888
01:40:12,697 --> 01:40:15,909
Let's have hands to stow these tortoises.

889
01:40:15,992 --> 01:40:20,079
Barret Bonden,
put your helm hard to starboard.

890
01:40:22,165 --> 01:40:25,543
He has a head start of two hours on us
and he's bearing south.

891
01:40:25,627 --> 01:40:29,339
That can only mean King Charles lsland.
He's looking for water.

892
01:40:29,422 --> 01:40:36,596
If we caught up with her, I mean, to take her...
we'd have to be bloody invisible.

893
01:40:37,805 --> 01:40:40,767
(above) Brace the yards to starboard!

894
01:40:50,026 --> 01:40:53,154
So, Stephen, did you get to see your bird?

895
01:40:53,238 --> 01:40:57,242
No. Well, yes, but I couldn't catch one.

896
01:40:57,951 --> 01:41:00,912
No, my greatest discovery
was your phantom.

897
01:41:00,995 --> 01:41:06,042
Indeed it was. I'm sorry you had to leave
the majority of your collection behind.

898
01:41:06,125 --> 01:41:12,131
In actual fact, Mr Blakeney and l
did make one... very interesting find.

899
01:41:12,215 --> 01:41:14,926
Is that right?

900
01:41:14,968 --> 01:41:17,220
Let me guess. A stick?

901
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:26,437
Tell him about it, Mr Blakeney.

902
01:41:26,521 --> 01:41:29,899
- It's a rare phasmid, sir.
- A phasmid?

903
01:41:29,983 --> 01:41:36,489
It's an insect that disguises itself as a stick
in order to confuse its predators.

904
01:42:28,791 --> 01:42:31,044
A nautical phasmid, Doctor.

905
01:42:31,127 --> 01:42:36,132
At least, to a hungry eye,
if one has an appetite for whalers.

906
01:42:36,216 --> 01:42:40,553
I intend to take a greater interest
in the bounty of nature from now on.

907
01:42:40,637 --> 01:42:45,183
I had no idea that a study of nature
could advance the art of naval warfare.

908
01:42:45,266 --> 01:42:47,268
Oh, I see.

909
01:42:47,352 --> 01:42:50,480
Now to pull this predator in close
and spring our trap.

910
01:42:50,563 --> 01:42:52,065
- Jack?
- Yes.

911
01:42:52,148 --> 01:42:54,984
You're the predator.

912
01:42:56,236 --> 01:43:01,324
There. Hull-down,
broad off the larboard bow.

913
01:43:01,407 --> 01:43:03,326
That's a frigate, all right.

914
01:43:03,409 --> 01:43:06,621
Damn, you've got good eyes, Barret.

915
01:43:06,704 --> 01:43:10,833
- Mr Allen! More smoke.
- Aye, sir!

916
01:43:10,917 --> 01:43:13,545
That'll bring 'em about.

917
01:43:24,389 --> 01:43:29,185
That's it, lads. Clean 'em up
so they fly straight and true.

918
01:43:31,729 --> 01:43:34,816
Let's have fresh flints in all the locks.

919
01:43:43,950 --> 01:43:48,788
(Pullings) Larboard battery,
unship your rear wheels.

920
01:43:53,293 --> 01:43:55,378
Drop the gun.

921
01:43:58,590 --> 01:44:02,218
- Come on, Killick, you too. Get dressed.
- Oh, God!

922
01:44:02,302 --> 01:44:05,221
- Tom?
- Our preparations are completed, sir.

923
01:44:05,305 --> 01:44:10,018
Good. Right, from now on
no "sirs", no salutes, no whistles, no bells.

924
01:44:10,101 --> 01:44:11,769
Aye, sir.

925
01:44:11,853 --> 01:44:15,481
Yes, I think we're all
finding that quite difficult.

926
01:44:16,399 --> 01:44:19,402
There'll be 30 or more whalers
locked in the Acheron's hold.

927
01:44:19,485 --> 01:44:22,864
After we board, Mr Calamy
should take a party and free them.

928
01:44:22,947 --> 01:44:26,826
- You think him ready, sir?
- Were you ready, Tom?

929
01:44:26,910 --> 01:44:29,704
- He may well turn the tide.
- lndeed, sir.

930
01:44:40,298 --> 01:44:42,550
She's taken the bait. Let's come about.

931
01:44:42,634 --> 01:44:46,679
Make a show of fleeing, panicky
and disorganised, like a whaler might.

932
01:44:46,763 --> 01:44:49,182
Present company excepted, Mr Hogg.

933
01:44:49,265 --> 01:44:51,142
Hurry up, or they'll see you.

934
01:44:51,226 --> 01:44:55,480
Eckhart, leave that. Just come up quick
and get some whaler's slops on.

935
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:12,622
- Congratulations. Acting third lieutenant.
- Thank you.

936
01:45:12,705 --> 01:45:17,418
- I hear we're to free the whalers.
- You're to be stationed on the quarterdeck.

937
01:45:17,502 --> 01:45:19,921
I'm sorry, Will.

938
01:45:21,881 --> 01:45:27,345
Make a bad show of keeping your course.
Let her run up and luff every now and then.

939
01:45:28,137 --> 01:45:31,099
- Excuse me, sir.
- Remove your hat. We're whalers.

940
01:45:31,182 --> 01:45:35,395
Mr Calamy says I'm not
on the boarding party. I wanted to say...

941
01:45:35,478 --> 01:45:39,566
I know what you want to say.
And my answer is no.

942
01:45:39,649 --> 01:45:44,028
You'll lead your gun crew, then when
we board, you'll take command of the ship.

943
01:45:44,112 --> 01:45:48,491
- Do I make myself clear?
- Take command of the ship... Thank you, sir.

944
01:45:48,575 --> 01:45:51,119
- Back to your station.
- Yes, sir.

945
01:45:54,289 --> 01:45:57,500
On your right upper arm,
to tell friend from foe!

946
01:45:57,584 --> 01:46:00,211
Davies, this arm. Starboard arm.

947
01:46:00,295 --> 01:46:04,048
- Is that the arm you got or don't got?
- Less of that cheek, Davies.

948
01:46:04,132 --> 01:46:07,927
Take your neck cloths
and put them round your right upper arm.

949
01:46:08,011 --> 01:46:10,597
Make way for the captain.

950
01:46:11,973 --> 01:46:14,058
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

951
01:46:14,142 --> 01:46:15,685
Right, lads.

952
01:46:15,768 --> 01:46:18,104
I know there's not a faint heart among you,

953
01:46:18,187 --> 01:46:21,983
and I know you're as anxious as I am
to get into close action.

954
01:46:22,066 --> 01:46:25,653
But we must bring him right up beside us
before we spring this trap.

955
01:46:25,737 --> 01:46:27,739
That will test our nerve.

956
01:46:27,822 --> 01:46:31,910
And discipline will count
just as much as courage.

957
01:46:31,993 --> 01:46:37,415
The Acheron is a tough nut to crack.
More than twice our guns and numbers.

958
01:46:37,498 --> 01:46:40,752
And they will sell their lives dearly.

959
01:46:42,587 --> 01:46:46,841
Topmen, your handling of the sheets
to be lubberly and un-navylike,

960
01:46:46,925 --> 01:46:49,636
until the signal
to spill the wind from our sails.

961
01:46:49,677 --> 01:46:53,097
This will bring us almost to a complete stop.

962
01:46:53,181 --> 01:46:56,809
Gun crews, you must run out and tie down
in double-quick time.

963
01:46:56,893 --> 01:47:02,190
With the rear wheels removed you've gained
elevation, but without recoil you can't reload.

964
01:47:02,273 --> 01:47:07,570
So, gun captains, that gives you one shot
from the larboard battery. One shot only.

965
01:47:07,654 --> 01:47:12,450
You'll fire for her mainmast.
Much will depend on your accuracy.

966
01:47:12,534 --> 01:47:20,875
However, even crippled she will still
be dangerous, like a wounded beast.

967
01:47:21,834 --> 01:47:23,878
Captain Howard and the marines

968
01:47:23,962 --> 01:47:28,258
will sweep their weather deck with swivel gun
and musket fire from the tops.

969
01:47:28,341 --> 01:47:31,386
They'll try and even the odds for us
before we board.

970
01:47:33,179 --> 01:47:36,724
They mean to take us as a prize.

971
01:47:36,808 --> 01:47:43,523
And we are worth more to them undamaged.
Their greed... will be their downfall.

972
01:47:45,358 --> 01:47:48,194
England is under threat of invasion.

973
01:47:48,278 --> 01:47:52,448
And though we be on the far side
of the world, this ship is our home.

974
01:47:54,075 --> 01:47:56,953
This ship is England.

975
01:48:00,081 --> 01:48:04,627
So it's every hand to his rope or gun.
Quick's the word and sharp's the action.

976
01:48:04,711 --> 01:48:08,089
After all, surprise is on our side.

977
01:48:08,172 --> 01:48:09,632
(laughter)

978
01:48:09,716 --> 01:48:14,012
Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!

979
01:48:19,601 --> 01:48:22,520
- Toss them high so they can see them.
- Hello, Doctor.

980
01:48:22,604 --> 01:48:23,980
Jack.

981
01:48:24,063 --> 01:48:26,316
- Care for a cigar?
- Thank you, no.

982
01:48:26,399 --> 01:48:28,985
If you please, Doctor.

983
01:48:30,403 --> 01:48:33,656
- I took the liberty, Doctor.
- Thank you, Killick.

984
01:48:33,740 --> 01:48:38,411
- There's three lumps in there.
- How kind.

985
01:49:24,123 --> 01:49:26,876
(shots roar over)

986
01:49:33,174 --> 01:49:35,677
- Good luck, Will.
- Good luck, Peter.

987
01:49:37,470 --> 01:49:41,015
- See you afterwards.
- And you.

988
01:49:42,058 --> 01:49:45,687
Steady now, lads. Keep calm.

989
01:49:48,147 --> 01:49:51,734
(over voice trumpet)
English whaler Syren, this is Acheron.

990
01:49:51,818 --> 01:49:53,486
- Barret.
- Sir.

991
01:49:53,570 --> 01:49:58,366
You have no possibility, no chance.
But you have had warning.

992
01:49:58,449 --> 01:50:01,911
Stop now, or we will destroy your ship.

993
01:50:01,995 --> 01:50:05,415
English whaler, this is your last warning.

994
01:50:05,498 --> 01:50:09,794
Stop now, or we will destroy you.

995
01:50:09,878 --> 01:50:12,130
- Let fly!
- Let fly!

996
01:50:14,090 --> 01:50:17,886
- Haul your yards there!
- C'est un navire de guerre!

997
01:50:19,220 --> 01:50:21,389
Run out, boys!

998
01:50:21,472 --> 01:50:22,640
Fire!

999
01:50:23,850 --> 01:50:25,643
Fire!

1000
01:50:34,527 --> 01:50:37,238
For the mainmast, lads!

1001
01:50:44,162 --> 01:50:46,623
- Let me through.
- Fire!

1002
01:50:48,249 --> 01:50:50,960
(sudden silence)

1003
01:51:00,053 --> 01:51:02,305
(creaking)

1004
01:51:03,681 --> 01:51:06,935
(French sailors shout)

1005
01:51:09,646 --> 01:51:12,398
Huzzah!

1006
01:51:14,234 --> 01:51:16,319
Hard a-larboard!

1007
01:51:17,028 --> 01:51:19,572
Right the headsails! Set the topsails!

1008
01:51:19,656 --> 01:51:20,949
Heave!

1009
01:51:22,033 --> 01:51:24,911
Man the starboard battery!

1010
01:51:31,042 --> 01:51:33,419
Fire as she bears!

1011
01:51:53,898 --> 01:51:56,859
Get to it! Get to it!

1012
01:51:56,943 --> 01:51:59,571
It's the fallen mast! We can't lay alongside.

1013
01:51:59,654 --> 01:52:02,699
Cross the wreckage as best you can.
I'll draw their fire.

1014
01:52:02,782 --> 01:52:06,744
- (Mowett) My division to join Mr Pullings!
- (Allen) Clew up topsails!

1015
01:52:06,828 --> 01:52:09,831
- Huzzah for Lucky Jack!
- Huzzah!

1016
01:52:09,914 --> 01:52:12,542
Grappling hooks away!

1017
01:52:12,625 --> 01:52:15,044
Run out the boarding planks!

1018
01:52:17,171 --> 01:52:22,343
- My division, follow me!
- For England, for home, and for the prize!

1019
01:52:22,969 --> 01:52:25,555
Here we go, lads!

1020
01:52:25,638 --> 01:52:28,433
(cheering and battle cries)

1021
01:52:29,726 --> 01:52:31,811
Pipe down. Silence.

1022
01:52:41,487 --> 01:52:43,948
(groaning)

1023
01:52:54,584 --> 01:52:56,586
Looks like the job is done, sir.

1024
01:52:56,669 --> 01:52:58,421
Acheron!

1025
01:53:12,727 --> 01:53:13,937
Fire!

1026
01:53:30,662 --> 01:53:33,039
Mr Blakeney, the nine-pounder!

1027
01:53:33,122 --> 01:53:34,999
That's it!

1028
01:53:35,083 --> 01:53:36,167
Fire!

1029
01:53:37,460 --> 01:53:39,754
Keep moving, men! Keep moving!

1030
01:54:28,887 --> 01:54:30,763
Joe!

1031
01:54:36,644 --> 01:54:38,271
Grenades, ready!

1032
01:54:48,448 --> 01:54:51,409
They're aiming for our hull!

1033
01:54:51,492 --> 01:54:54,204
They could sink us! Depress the muzzle!

1034
01:54:54,245 --> 01:54:56,289
Padeen, train it aft!

1035
01:54:56,372 --> 01:54:58,041
Together now!

1036
01:54:58,958 --> 01:55:01,085
Stand clear!

1037
01:55:01,169 --> 01:55:02,962
Fire!

1038
01:55:03,838 --> 01:55:06,257
Arm yourselves! We must board them!

1039
01:55:07,634 --> 01:55:09,719
Follow me!

1040
01:55:25,151 --> 01:55:26,903
Now!

1041
01:55:31,574 --> 01:55:35,703
Whalers, follow me!
Mr Hogg, down below! Quickly now!

1042
01:55:38,164 --> 01:55:41,960
Albatrosses! Albatrosses, do you hear me?

1043
01:55:42,919 --> 01:55:44,963
To the guns! To the guns!

1044
01:55:48,550 --> 01:55:50,885
Boyle, douse that gun's priming!

1045
01:56:26,087 --> 01:56:29,090
Lively there! Come on! Move!

1046
01:56:32,635 --> 01:56:35,346
Now do your worst!

1047
01:56:50,820 --> 01:56:53,031
Non! Non! Non!

1048
01:57:06,669 --> 01:57:08,630
- Mr Howard.
- Sir.

1049
01:57:08,713 --> 01:57:11,341
- Have they struck their colours?
- I believe so.

1050
01:57:11,424 --> 01:57:15,094
- Has their captain been sighted?
- Not yet, sir.

1051
01:57:15,178 --> 01:57:17,055
- Carry on.
- Aye, sir.

1052
01:57:38,701 --> 01:57:42,080
- Le capitaine?
- L'infirmerie.

1053
01:57:59,847 --> 01:58:01,933
Docteur? Docteur?

1054
01:58:02,016 --> 01:58:04,102
Oui.

1055
01:58:19,033 --> 01:58:21,452
Docteur de Vigny, monsieur.

1056
01:58:21,536 --> 01:58:24,330
I did what I could for him.

1057
01:58:29,419 --> 01:58:33,548
Before the capitaine died...
he said I was to give you this.

1058
02:00:03,555 --> 02:00:06,516
No. I'll do it.

1059
02:00:20,238 --> 02:00:22,657
Can you help me?

1060
02:00:46,514 --> 02:00:48,349
Our Father,

1061
02:00:48,433 --> 02:00:52,478
(all) who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

1062
02:00:52,562 --> 02:00:56,441
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,

1063
02:00:56,524 --> 02:00:58,902
on earth as it is in heaven.

1064
02:00:59,569 --> 02:01:02,322
Give us this day our daily bread,

1065
02:01:02,405 --> 02:01:07,327
and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against us.

1066
02:01:07,410 --> 02:01:11,497
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

1067
02:01:11,581 --> 02:01:13,541
For thine is the kingdom,

1068
02:01:13,625 --> 02:01:15,668
the power and the glory,

1069
02:01:15,752 --> 02:01:17,837
forever and ever.

1070
02:01:17,921 --> 02:01:19,464
Amen.

1071
02:01:20,089 --> 02:01:23,551
Robert Gardner, able seaman.

1072
02:01:23,635 --> 02:01:27,472
James Lloyd, boatswain's mate.

1073
02:01:27,555 --> 02:01:30,600
Robert Kemp, able seaman.

1074
02:01:31,809 --> 02:01:35,730
John Antonio, quartermaster's mate.

1075
02:01:36,981 --> 02:01:40,944
Michael Doudle, able seaman.

1076
02:01:42,445 --> 02:01:46,115
Joseph Nagle, carpenter's mate.

1077
02:01:47,742 --> 02:01:50,995
John Allen, sailing master.

1078
02:01:56,501 --> 02:01:58,503
Peter Miles Calamy...

1079
02:02:03,216 --> 02:02:05,468
Iieutenant.

1080
02:02:07,887 --> 02:02:11,140
We therefore commit
their bodies to the deep,

1081
02:02:11,224 --> 02:02:13,393
to be turned into corruption,

1082
02:02:13,476 --> 02:02:17,313
Iooking for the resurrection of the body
when the sea shall give up her dead,

1083
02:02:17,397 --> 02:02:20,275
and the life of the world to come,

1084
02:02:20,358 --> 02:02:23,695
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

1085
02:02:23,778 --> 02:02:25,864
Amen.

1086
02:02:54,726 --> 02:02:57,020
It's our old friend.

1087
02:03:41,314 --> 02:03:43,608
(distant orders)

1088
02:03:51,407 --> 02:03:54,410
Pass down a barrel of paint, please.

1089
02:04:00,917 --> 02:04:05,088
Sir, the whalers are all aboard
and that's the last detachment of marines.

1090
02:04:05,171 --> 02:04:06,798
Good, good.

1091
02:04:06,881 --> 02:04:09,676
I think I shall return to the Galapagos.

1092
02:04:09,759 --> 02:04:13,513
Take on food and water and give
the doctor a few days to find his bird.

1093
02:04:13,596 --> 02:04:14,806
Very good, sir.

1094
02:04:14,889 --> 02:04:18,351
You, however,
shall take the Acheron south to Valparaiso.

1095
02:04:18,434 --> 02:04:23,648
Parole the prisoners there, refit as necessary,
and we shall rendezvous in Portsmouth.

1096
02:04:23,731 --> 02:04:26,776
I believe Mr Hogg
would be a good choice for sailing master.

1097
02:04:26,860 --> 02:04:31,614
However, that will be your decision,
Captain Pullings.

1098
02:04:36,536 --> 02:04:38,621
Your orders.

1099
02:04:42,417 --> 02:04:45,169
- Thank you, sir.
- Godspeed, Tom.

1100
02:04:45,253 --> 02:04:47,255
And to you, sir.

1101
02:04:53,011 --> 02:04:54,971
- Mr Mowett?
- With pleasure, sir.

1102
02:04:55,054 --> 02:04:57,765
- Good luck.
- See you in Portsmouth.

1103
02:04:57,807 --> 02:05:01,311
Now, lads, huzzah for Captain Pullings!

1104
02:05:01,394 --> 02:05:03,313
- Hip, hip...
- Huzzah!

1105
02:05:03,771 --> 02:05:05,648
- Hip, hip...
- Huzzah!

1106
02:05:06,024 --> 02:05:08,860
- Hip, hip...
- Huzzah!

1107
02:05:08,943 --> 02:05:12,697
- (Blakeney) Good luck, sir.
- Good luck, Captain.

1108
02:05:24,500 --> 02:05:27,503
(violin and cello tuning up)

1109
02:05:28,713 --> 02:05:30,632
Oh, here we go again.

1110
02:05:30,715 --> 02:05:33,176
(Aubrey) Killick! Killick there!

1111
02:05:33,259 --> 02:05:36,054
Which it will be ready when it's ready!

1112
02:05:41,601 --> 02:05:44,520
I'll rest easier when I know
they've reached shore.

1113
02:05:44,604 --> 02:05:49,901
So many wounded, and only that poor
unfortunate Higgins to tend to them.

1114
02:05:49,984 --> 02:05:53,655
Still, he's better than no doctor at all.

1115
02:05:53,738 --> 02:05:58,535
- I met their doctor. I spoke to him.
- No, he died of fever months ago.

1116
02:05:58,618 --> 02:06:01,204
- De Vigny?
- Mm.

1117
02:06:09,128 --> 02:06:10,838
Ah.

1118
02:06:12,715 --> 02:06:16,511
- Pass the word for Mr Mowett.
- Mr Mowett to the great cabin.

1119
02:06:16,594 --> 02:06:19,639
Their "doctor" gave me this sword.

1120
02:06:20,598 --> 02:06:21,808
Sir.

1121
02:06:21,891 --> 02:06:24,936
Mr Mowett, change of course.
Southeast by east.

1122
02:06:25,019 --> 02:06:28,523
We'll intercept the Acheron
and escort them into Valparaiso.

1123
02:06:28,606 --> 02:06:31,484
Aye, sir. Sou'east by east.

1124
02:06:32,527 --> 02:06:35,280
- And William...
- Sir?

1125
02:06:35,363 --> 02:06:38,116
- Beat to quarters.
- Very good, sir.

1126
02:06:43,162 --> 02:06:46,624
Subject to the requirements of the service.

1127
02:06:50,336 --> 02:06:52,005
Ah.

1128
02:06:54,048 --> 02:06:57,385
Well, Stephen... the bird's flightless?

1129
02:06:57,468 --> 02:06:58,553
Yes.

1130
02:06:59,637 --> 02:07:02,348
It's not going anywhere.

1131
02:07:02,849 --> 02:07:05,560
(strums jolly tune on violin)

1132
