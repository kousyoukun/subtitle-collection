he could be here any minute now.

- I'll fucking kill you.
- Just let him go.

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,730
No fucking way.
He's fucking dead.

102
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,451
Give me one fucking reason
why I shouldn't do it.

- I'm drawing a blank.
- What?

104

I think you should shoot me.
Let's be honest, you've been aggrieved.

105

Don't mess with him, Nicky,
he's done hard time.

106

I've done fucking hard time.

If you had any idea what I was
about to do to her...

108
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,288
- Shut up, man.
- She was gonna be no good to you after that.

109
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,920
- So you should really shoot me.
- What the fuck?

110
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,602
- What kind of stuff are we talking about?
- Saudi bachelor party shit.

Stop fucking around.
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

115

You'd really be doing me a favor.
Cancer.

Pull the trigger, you'll see.

118
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,565
You...?
You got cancer?

119
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,042
- He's onto us.
- Shit! I knew this wasn't gonna fucking work!

120
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,248
- You guys suck.
- Just give us the money.

121
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,080
- Or?
- JESS: He'll shoot you in the neck.

122
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,488
I don't wanna shoot a guy with cancer.
Grandma Mukulski had cancer.

123
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,480
- He doesn't have cancer, you idiot!
- You guys really boned this thing.

124
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,760
First of all, you gotta wait
till she gets my pants off.

125
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,963
And then you gotta give me a chance
to run. That's how you get the money.

126
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,208
And you never drop the con.

127
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,566
You never break.

128
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,006
Die with the lie.

129
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,446
When did you make us?

130
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,080
Uh, when you stole the wallet
from the bum downstairs.

131
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,571
Bullshit.

132
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,725
No, real shit.

133
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,082
Then why'd you come up here
if you're so smart?

134
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,608
Professional curiosity.

135
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,290
And I like boobs, you know.

136
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,930
I figured it was a win-win.

137
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,641
- All thumbs, sweetheart. It was a bum lift.
- It was a great lift.

138
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,690
Please. He was so shithoused,
you could've taken his appendix.

139
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,569
You suck.

140
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,922
You really should be more aware.

141
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,924
I've been behind you for two blocks.
You didn't see me?

142
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,481
I don't have eyes in the back of my head.

143
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,928
Well, if you're gonna play this game,
you might wanna grow a pair.

144
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,120
I can take care of myself.

145
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,964
No, you're gonna get hurt.

146
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,690
Let me buy you coffee.

147
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,450
I don't drink coffee.

148
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,486
Fine.

149
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,486
Fine.

150
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,366
So, what's your thing?

151
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,729
- Inside? Roper? You can tell me.
- Mm.

152
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,769
Everything.
Been in this game so long.

153
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,969
- I wanna Cannon. That's what I wanna do.
- Oh, really?

154
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,168
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

155
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,125
My grandfather used to run
a crooked game in Harlem.

156
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,971
Eventually, my father started
shilling for him.

157
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,366
Uh...

158
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,124
One day they get burned.

159
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,568
Mobbed-up guy catches them
throwing signals.

160
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,008
Everybody's guns come out. Standoff.

161
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,162
No way out. Except one.

162
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,607
The Toledo Panic Button.

163
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,606
What the hell is that?

164
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,121
You shoot your partner.
It proves you're not together.

165
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,488
You kill your partner?

166
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,651
You hope you don't.

167
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,205
Does it work?

168
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,170
He's 0 for 3.

169
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,006
So your father killed your grandfather?

170
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,446
That's the world you're in.

171
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,364
Dabblers get killed.

172
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,808
Look, I wasn't born into this like you.

173
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,645
I was a dyslexic foster kid.

174
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,131
No prospects, no future.

175
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,681
I mean, it's a minor miracle
I'm not a hooker right now.

176
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,080
- Tutor me.
- No.

177
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,810
- Why not?
- I'm headed out of town.

178
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,365
Well, wait, look, I can pay you.

179
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,606
- If that helps.
- Whose wallet is that?

180
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,361
Uh, "Dr. Peter Woshilak."

182
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,088
NICKY: All right, we're gonna make
this quick because it's really cold.

183
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,722
Now I'm gonna show you a few touches,
but at the end of the day...

184
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,724
this is a game of focus.

185
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,888
- That's very clever.
- All right, now, attention is like a spotlight.

186
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,205
And our job...

187
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,324
is to dance in the darkness.

188
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,849
I didn't even feel you take that.

189
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,846
The human brain is slow,
and it cannot multitask.

190
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,323
Jesus. When...?

191
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,642
All right, I'm sure you can flip a leather
on its feet.

192
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,202
But what we're talking about
is much more complex than that.

193
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,045
- When did you take my wallet?
- You take Zumba?

194
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,844
It's actually a really good cardio workout.
Thank you very much.

195
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,650
You're thinking with your hands.

196
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,127
You gotta get inside the Vic's head.
Perceive from their perspective.

197
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,408
Human behavior is very predictable.

198
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,444
If I look at my hand,
it naturally pulls your gaze...

199
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,568
and allows me to enter your space.

200
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,167
But when I look up at you,
it causes you to look directly at me.

201
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,366
Cute.

202
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,727
I touch you here, I steal from here.

- You're not gonna slap my face, are you?
- Why?

206
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,488
You would if you knew
where my hand was.

207
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,487
Okay, I get it. I get it.

So why do I like this place?

213
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,601
Lots of space. Doesn't open
for a month or two.

00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,526
We can tie into multiple lines, diffuse
our footprint, keep hopping DNS addresses.

- Yep.

Man, he should do a cleanse.

Horst, he is a 400-pound Persian.
He is not gonna do a cleanse.

- Admit that you're impressed.

I got your wallet and I found you
all the way down here.

Please. World Series, Final Four...

That's gotta count for something.

So how many Hyatts did you have to go to?

All three, five times each.

234
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,446
- I want in.
- Maybe I'm just here to watch the game.

235
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,001
I asked around who ran the game in Harlem.

236
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,006
The Limehouse Kid is your grandfather.
Bucky Spurgeon is your father.

237
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,804
"Father" is a very generous term.

238
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,281
And you're Nicky Spurgeon.
They call you "Mellow."

00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,842
- I'm all crewed up, sweetie.
- Oh, come on. Please! Can we...?

240
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,246
Can we just...?

241
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,321
Can we skip the part where I speak
through thinly veiled allure...

242
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,882
and lead you to believe there's some
earth-shattering hump in the works?

243
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,760
Because I suck at that kind of stuff.
I just want in.

244
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,810
- No earth-shattering hump in the works?
- No.

245
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,281
- I don't even get "thinly veiled allure"?
- No.

246
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,807
No baby voice?
No lingering eye contact?

247
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,485
I am hopeless.

- Does it feel sexy on your face?
- A little.

fingers means the leather's an insider.

If it's a cordeen or an ox tongue,
I'll scratch my nose.

Unless I use my thumb, which means
I am actually scratching my nose.

Oh. Yeah, you know,
I don't like that name.

I know, but why do they call you that?

So he started calling me marshmallow.

- Mellow.
- Yeah.

01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:51,123
- Ah. Agh!
- JESS: Are you okay?

1562
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,888
- Oh, Jesus.
- Here. Hold on to that. Hold on to that.

1563
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:58,209
Keep your eye on that. If he can't breathe,
you pull the plunger again.

1564
01:34:58,360 --> 01:34:59,566
- Okay?
- Okay.

1565
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:02,451
Good Lord, I cannot believe
that you made me shoot you.

1566
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:06,286
And then for what? So that you can make
cow eyes at some race skank!

1567
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:09,127
- She is not a race skank!
- I'm not a race skank!

1568
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:11,760
You die with the lie, Mellow...

1569
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:13,809
and you still just might.

1570
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:16,201
- Fuck you. Don't call me "Mellow."
OWENS: Jesus Christ.

1571
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:17,805
You're his dad?

1572
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:20,281
In the loosest fucking possible terms.

1573
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,331
I'm Bucky, by the way.

1574
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:25,000
You know, I like you, honey.
You can take a punch. Ha-ha.

1575
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:27,329
- NICKY: God.
- And there it is.

1576
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:30,450
Tell you what, you steal us a car,
and I'll gather up the money.

1577
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:31,931
I can't steal a car.

1578
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:43,566
OWENS: I've been working
for this prick Spaniard for three years...

1579
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:46,405
and he's got a guy at McEwen
and doesn't tell me?

1580
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:48,801
What the hell ever happened to trust?

1581
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,485
Are we almost there?

1582
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:53,843
I bust my ass to get you
that EXR crap and... Agh.

1583
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:56,330
And then the girl walked in.

1584
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:58,841
(GROANING)
Don't be an asshole.

1585
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,843
That any way to talk to your father?

1586
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:04,411
You're not my father.
You walked away.

1587
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:06,840
(SIGHS)

1588
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:16,523
I took you off the street.

1589
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:19,604
Taught you my trade,
I taught you my passion.

1590
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:23,881
Three generations of skills.

1591
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:31,001
Ah. And in spite of all my earnest efforts,
in spite of all my hard work...

1592
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:33,288
you turned into a good person.

1593
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:34,805
Well, I just...

1594
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:37,089
Ah. Go figure.

1595
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:38,961
(SIGHS)

1596
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:43,284
And I left you on the street
for a good goddamn reason.

1597
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:46,723
- Because I was soft.
- Oh, that just shows what you know...

1598
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:49,167
you dumb son of a bitch.

1599
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:58,729
We had a good thing going.

1600
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:02,808
And then one day...

1601
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:07,249
like seven years in, we're running
this poker deal in Boston...

1602
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:09,050
and a guy pulled a gun.

1603
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:10,770
Fucking gun. Glock.

1604
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:12,729
First time I'd ever seen one.

1605
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:15,326
And I'm just paralyzed.

1606
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:18,166
Heh.

1607
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:21,369
And all I could think about was the kid.

1608
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:26,249
That night I walked.
I never looked back.

1609
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:33,281
Love'll get you killed in this racket.

1610
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:36,843
No place for that shit here.

1611
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:39,369
No happiness with that.

1612
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:45,448
You know how they say
there's honor among thieves.

1613
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:48,442
Well, you're no thief, Mellow.

1614
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:53,084
You made your choice.

1615
01:37:57,880 --> 01:38:00,360
- So I'm taking the money.
- Mmm.

1616
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:02,645
All of it.

1617
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:06,081
- Mm-mm.
- OWENS: Uh-huh.

1618
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:07,890
(GROANS)

1619
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:12,249
Well, that explains a lot.

1620
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:13,970
Yeah, that's Dad.

1621
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:18,802
- No.
- Yep.

Okay, that's good, that's good.

1627
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:41,002
- Mm.
- Okay, almost there.

1628
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:43,967
I don't know what we're gonna do now.

1629
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:47,205
We'll be fine.

1630
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:49,006
How?

1631
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:51,200
