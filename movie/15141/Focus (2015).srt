And I like boobs, you know.

90
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,930
I figured it was a win-win.

91
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,641
- All thumbs, sweetheart. It was a bum lift.
- It was a great lift.

- Mm.

- Yeah, okay.

109

My grandfather used to run
a crooked game in Harlem.

110
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,971
Eventually, my father started
shilling for him.

Everybody's guns come out. Standoff.

115
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,162
No way out. Except one.

116

What the hell is that?

118
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,121
You shoot your partner.
It proves you're not together.

119
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,488
You kill your partner?

120
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,651
You hope you don't.

121
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,205
Does it work?

122
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,170
He's 0 for 3.

123
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,006
So your father killed your grandfather?

124
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,446
That's the world you're in.

125
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,364
Dabblers get killed.

126
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,808
Look, I wasn't born into this like you.

127
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,645
I was a dyslexic foster kid.

No prospects, no future.

129
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,681
I mean, it's a minor miracle
I'm not a hooker right now.

- Tutor me.
- No.

131
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,810
- Why not?
- I'm headed out of town.

132
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,365
Well, wait, look, I can pay you.

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,606
- If that helps.
- Whose wallet is that?

It's actually a really good cardio workout.
Thank you very much.

149

You're thinking with your hands.

150
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,127
You gotta get inside the Vic's head.
Perceive from their perspective.

Human behavior is very predictable.

it naturally pulls your gaze...

153

and allows me to enter your space.

154
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,167
But when I look up at you,
it causes you to look directly at me.

01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:51,123

1516
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,888

- Here. Hold on to that. Hold on to that.

Keep your eye on that. If he can't breathe,
you pull the plunger again.

- Okay?
- Okay.

1519
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:02,451
Good Lord, I cannot believe
that you made me shoot you.

1520
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:06,286
And then for what? So that you can make
cow eyes at some race skank!

1521
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:09,127
- She is not a race skank!
- I'm not a race skank!

and you still just might.

1524
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:16,201

You know, I like you, honey.
You can take a punch. Ha-ha.

- And there it is.

1530
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:30,450

I took you off the street.

Taught you my trade,
I taught you my passion.

for a good goddamn reason.

1551
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:46,723
- Because I was soft.
- Oh, that just shows what you know...

you dumb son of a bitch.

1553

We had a good thing going.

1554
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:02,808
And then one day...

1555
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:07,249
like seven years in, we're running
this poker deal in Boston...

1556
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:09,050
and a guy pulled a gun.

Fucking gun. Glock.

1558
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:12,729
First time I'd ever seen one.

Heh.

1561
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:21,369
And all I could think about was the kid.

1562
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:26,249
That night I walked.
I never looked back.

1563
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:33,281
Love'll get you killed in this racket.

No happiness with that.

there's honor among thieves.

Well, you're no thief, Mellow.

You made your choice.
