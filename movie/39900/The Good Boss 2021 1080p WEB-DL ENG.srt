00:02:14,127 --> 00:02:14,820
﻿Pigs!

00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:17,737
﻿Go, go, go!

4
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:20,237
﻿Get out of here!

00:02:20,376 --> 00:02:21,557
﻿-Pig!
-Garbage!

00:02:22,147 --> 00:02:23,327
﻿Scum!

7
00:02:26,141 --> 00:02:27,771
﻿Hit him harder!

8
00:02:28,605 --> 00:02:30,445
﻿Go fucking home!

<i>﻿Contact dispatch.</i>

12
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:51,693
<i>﻿403 to dispatch,
visual contact with the individual.</i>

13
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:55,373
<i>﻿He's running his ass off.
We've got him!</i>

14
00:02:59,194 --> 00:03:00,859
﻿Stop!

15
00:03:01,485 --> 00:03:02,977
﻿Freeze!

16
00:03:10,096 --> 00:03:14,157
﻿THE GOOD BOSS

17
00:03:14,263 --> 00:03:16,934
﻿BLANCO SCALES

18
00:03:17,075 --> 00:03:19,400
<i>﻿We have a lot to celebrate.</i>

19
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:22,351
﻿Thanks to everyone
we've grown this year.

20
00:03:22,491 --> 00:03:24,157
﻿Thanks to Marketing,

21
00:03:26,484 --> 00:03:30,024
﻿the people from R&D,
but without the ability

22
00:03:30,164 --> 00:03:31,448
﻿of the production line

23
00:03:31,553 --> 00:03:34,815
﻿to meet commitments,
we wouldn't be where we are:

24
00:03:35,025 --> 00:03:36,204
﻿Miralles!

25
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,648
﻿Thank you,

26
00:03:40,788 --> 00:03:43,287
﻿really, thank you. For being there,

27
00:03:43,983 --> 00:03:45,440
﻿at the helm.

28
00:03:45,823 --> 00:03:49,051
﻿We have to celebrate,
but without getting care-less,

29
00:03:49,191 --> 00:03:51,203
﻿because thanks to you

30
00:03:51,308 --> 00:03:54,780
﻿today we're finalists for the award
given by the regional government

31
00:03:54,885 --> 00:03:56,897
﻿for business excellence.

32
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,467
﻿"Excellence."

33
00:03:59,676 --> 00:04:03,217
﻿Don't you like the sound
of that word?

34
00:04:03,391 --> 00:04:05,855
﻿There are three candidates.
Three.

35
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,327
﻿And Blanco Scales is one of them.

36
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:20,438
﻿So in the next few days we'll be getting
a visit from the award committee.

37
00:04:20,577 --> 00:04:22,659
﻿They can show up at any time,

38
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:25,263
﻿so we have to be alert.

39
00:04:25,404 --> 00:04:26,132
﻿They'll ask you questions

40
00:04:26,341 --> 00:04:30,194
﻿"Hey, what's it like
to work at Blanco Scales?"

41
00:04:30,368 --> 00:04:32,937
﻿And you tell them the truth:
"It's wonderful."

42
00:04:34,014 --> 00:04:35,575
﻿And Mr. Blanco

43
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,173
﻿is like a father to us, we adore him.

44
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,068
﻿Well, you all know my wife and I
don't have children,

45
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:44,394
﻿and we don't need any

46
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:46,443
﻿because you're our children.

47
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:50,193
﻿If you're okay, then I'm okay.

48
00:04:52,173 --> 00:04:54,047
﻿-Not in front of the kids!
-Bullshit!

49
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,824
﻿And just like

50
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,630
﻿with children, well..

51
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:00,921
﻿sometimes you have favorites.

52
00:05:02,241 --> 00:05:06,442
﻿Or there might be another one

53
00:05:06,547 --> 00:05:09,809
﻿who asks for less, but needs more.

54
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:11,754
﻿You're going to tell me
what to do!

55
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:17,170
﻿And sometimes you have to make

56
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:22,309
﻿difficult decisions,
for the good of the family, right?

57
00:05:25,504 --> 00:05:26,509
﻿Dad!

58
00:05:31,892 --> 00:05:32,863
﻿Dad!

59
00:05:35,712 --> 00:05:38,315
﻿Say it again, let them hear you.

60
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,432
-Sit down.
-José, whar are you doing?

61
00:05:40,572 --> 00:05:43,383
﻿Tell them, if you have the balls.
Tell them I'm fired.

62
00:05:43,524 --> 00:05:44,669
﻿Listen to this gentleman,
he has something to tell you.

63
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:48,939
﻿-José, get your kids out of here.
-Let them hear it, Rubio.

64
00:05:49,044 --> 00:05:50,466
﻿I want you to tell them.

65
00:05:50,607 --> 00:05:52,654
﻿If you're going to fire me,
tell me in front of them.

66
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,841
José, they can't be here.

67
00:05:54,982 --> 00:05:58,765
﻿Yes, they can. If they can be left
out on the fucking street,

68
00:05:58,904 --> 00:06:00,257
﻿-they can be here.
-José...

69
00:06:00,398 --> 00:06:02,688
﻿With the shitty severance pay
you're giving me!

70
00:06:02,794 --> 00:06:03,764
﻿I understand, really.

71
00:06:03,904 --> 00:06:07,688
﻿I have two homes to maintain!
You know that!

72
00:06:07,793 --> 00:06:10,813
﻿I'll have to leave mine, damn it.

73
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:12,097
﻿And I'll lose them.

74
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,555
﻿I'll lose them.

75
00:06:13,695 --> 00:06:16,298
﻿-Take them away and we'll talk.
-So I want you to tell them.

76
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:20,083
﻿So when they ask me why they can't go
to swimming, I'll tell them:

77
00:06:20,223 --> 00:06:23,346
﻿Remember that son of a bitch
in a tie who was so nice

78
00:06:23,486 --> 00:06:27,374
﻿and was so worried about you?
Well, it's his fault you can't go.

79
00:06:27,514 --> 00:06:29,214
﻿It's his fault you can't do anything!

80
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:31,505
<i>﻿Goodbyes...</i>

81
00:06:32,652 --> 00:06:36,887
<i>﻿Goodbyes are really tough.
Nobody likes having to go.</i>

82
00:06:38,068 --> 00:06:41,228
<i>﻿In this company,
they hurt even more,</i>

83
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,144
<i>﻿because the relationships
we create here go far beyond</i>

84
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:45,394
﻿what it says in the contracts.

85
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:48,415
﻿Those of you who knew my father

86
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:53,066
﻿know that he was a just man,
that's why he made scales.

87
00:06:53,971 --> 00:06:57,928
﻿He'd say: "We care about balance,
equity." I'm seeing him.

88
00:06:58,796 --> 00:07:03,066
﻿"A society that makes more scales
is a society with more justice."

89
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:04,976
﻿And how right he was.

90
00:07:05,706 --> 00:07:08,413
﻿Your father started with him,
right, Miralles?

91
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,767
﻿They were brothers.

92
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:14,003
﻿Well, I inherited his passion
for work,

93
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:17,926
﻿his passion for scales
and his passion for loyalty.

94
00:07:18,066 --> 00:07:21,884
﻿Because loyalty is very important
in this company, as you know.

95
00:07:22,545 --> 00:07:23,481
﻿Very important.

96
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,683
﻿But saying goodbye
is also important because

97
00:07:27,788 --> 00:07:29,801
﻿it's part of life's process.

98
00:07:30,913 --> 00:07:32,543
﻿And today is the end

99
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:37,543
﻿of an important cycle
for some of you.

100
00:07:38,551 --> 00:07:41,050
﻿And we're here to say goodbye

101
00:07:41,746 --> 00:07:43,341
﻿to those who are emancipating,

102
00:07:43,481 --> 00:07:47,578
﻿to move on to other places,
other challenges.

103
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:50,702
﻿They stop being worms

104
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:52,750
﻿and become butterflies.

105
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:54,174
﻿Okay.

106
00:07:55,355 --> 00:07:58,791
﻿Please, don't get me wrong,
I mean that warmly.

107
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:03,548
﻿Here we gave you plenty of love.

108
00:08:05,008 --> 00:08:09,972
﻿We taught you everything we know
at Blanco Scales, which is a lot.

109
00:08:10,632 --> 00:08:11,811
We held nothing back.

110
00:08:12,507 --> 00:08:15,457
﻿And, now, Inés, please.

111
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:17,680
﻿Thank you.

112
00:08:18,722 --> 00:08:20,422
﻿Now we want...

113
00:08:21,014 --> 00:08:22,714
﻿to give you a little something.

114
00:08:23,895 --> 00:08:25,630
So that wherever you fly away to...

115
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:31,429
﻿you'll always keep us close
to your hearts. Victoria, come here.

116
00:08:36,534 --> 00:08:38,199
﻿Let's see if I can

117
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:39,762
﻿do this without pricking you.

118
00:08:40,977 --> 00:08:42,018
﻿There.

119
00:08:44,172 --> 00:08:45,386
﻿Calm down.

120
00:08:50,283 --> 00:08:51,809
﻿Stay calm, Vicky.

121
00:08:51,914 --> 00:08:52,782
﻿I love you.

122
00:09:02,434 --> 00:09:05,419
We form very strong bonds
at this company.

123
00:09:09,587 --> 00:09:10,870
﻿I got emotional!

124
00:09:12,434 --> 00:09:18,786
﻿SUNDAY

125
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,701
﻿BLANCO SCALES, ONE BIG FAMILY

126
00:09:56,945 --> 00:09:58,298
﻿What are you thinking about?

127
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:01,215
﻿Nothing.

128
00:10:04,862 --> 00:10:06,804
﻿It's impossible to think
about nothing.

129
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:12,915
﻿What is he doing?

130
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,220
﻿He's fixing the water filter.

131
00:10:18,402 --> 00:10:19,651
﻿On a Sunday?

132
00:10:31,943 --> 00:10:34,615
﻿There was something
I needed to tell you...

133
00:10:37,116 --> 00:10:38,260
﻿It was important.

134
00:10:39,095 --> 00:10:40,552
﻿But I can't remember.

135
00:10:41,109 --> 00:10:42,775
﻿Then it must not be so important.

136
00:10:48,886 --> 00:10:50,031
Ma'am.

137
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:51,837
﻿Does it work now?

138
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:55,170
﻿I couldn't check the boiler,
I haven't had time, boss.

139
00:10:55,275 --> 00:10:58,399
﻿Thanks, don't worry about it.
Go home.

140
00:10:59,406 --> 00:11:03,155
﻿Boss, you always say
that our problems

141
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,175
﻿are your problems,
that if something affects us...

142
00:11:06,281 --> 00:11:08,050
﻿It affects me too, yes.

143
00:11:08,155 --> 00:11:08,849
﻿What's wrong?

144
00:11:09,371 --> 00:11:12,946
﻿My kid got into a fight
and spent

145
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:14,404
﻿all night at the police station.

146
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,356
﻿The one in the park
mentioned in the paper?

147
00:11:17,496 --> 00:11:18,953
﻿It wasn't them.

148
00:11:19,092 --> 00:11:22,216
﻿The Arabs provoked them,
the paper doesn't say that part.

149
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:23,085
﻿Oh, God.

150
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,528
﻿He's a good kid, you've known him
since he was a boy.

151
00:11:27,669 --> 00:11:29,716
﻿You came to his baptism,
remember?

152
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:33,188
﻿It's that group
of friends he hangs around with.

153
00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:35,271
﻿I don't know.

154
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,792
﻿What was the delegate's last name?

155
00:11:42,043 --> 00:11:44,021
﻿His wife goes to the shop.

156
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,381
﻿-De la Encina?
-De la Encina.

157
00:11:50,063 --> 00:11:52,214
﻿COURTHOUSE

158
00:12:32,282 --> 00:12:35,476
﻿You talk to him, boss.
He respects you.

159
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:13,147
﻿Deal?

160
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:28,493
﻿We made a pact as gentlemen.

161
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,577
﻿It's a secret, you can't tell anyone.

162
00:13:32,453 --> 00:13:35,576
﻿Have him stop by my wife's shop
on Monday.

163
00:13:36,237 --> 00:13:38,353
﻿We owe you one, boss.

164
00:13:43,562 --> 00:13:48,596
﻿MONDAY

165
00:14:24,393 --> 00:14:25,434
﻿Boss!

166
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,454
﻿What's that?

167
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:31,058
﻿It's local. A reed warbler.

168
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,003
﻿Its nest must be nearby.

169
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:36,614
﻿It's been coming around
the last few days.

170
00:14:37,032 --> 00:14:39,808
﻿I give it a little syrup sometimes...

171
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,939
﻿It must be off kilter.

172
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:51,752
﻿Have someone fix it, please.

173
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,280
﻿It can't be like that.

174
00:15:04,148 --> 00:15:05,571
﻿Good morning, everyone.

175
00:15:06,648 --> 00:15:09,042
﻿Please, stop calling.
You're jamming my phone.

176
00:15:09,147 --> 00:15:11,820
﻿-Good morning, Inés.
-It's José.

177
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,076
﻿He's called ten times this morning.

178
00:15:14,182 --> 00:15:15,292
José, which José.

179
00:15:15,397 --> 00:15:18,243
﻿The guy who brought his kids.
He's out of control.

180
00:15:18,348 --> 00:15:19,493
﻿What do I tell him?

181
00:15:20,293 --> 00:15:22,097
﻿Tell him to calm down,
I'll call him back.

182
00:15:22,237 --> 00:15:25,742
﻿-He wants to talk to Blanco.
-And I want to talk to the Pope.

183
00:15:33,104 --> 00:15:33,937
﻿How ugly.

184
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:37,478
﻿What an ugly thing to do to your kids.

185
00:15:37,618 --> 00:15:40,637
﻿He's harmless, I'll handle it.

186
00:15:41,471 --> 00:15:42,720
﻿Where was he?

187
00:15:42,861 --> 00:15:43,345
﻿Accounts.

188
00:15:43,486 --> 00:15:45,637
﻿Don't let him take anything.

189
00:15:46,853 --> 00:15:47,790
﻿There's no danger.

190
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,873
﻿We have worse problems.

191
00:15:52,617 --> 00:15:54,352
﻿Miralles? Again?

192
00:15:54,492 --> 00:15:55,845
﻿-He screwed up again.
-Damn it.

193
00:15:59,735 --> 00:16:02,025
﻿And is it serious?

194
00:16:02,165 --> 00:16:04,525
﻿He ordered the wrong processors.

195
00:16:04,665 --> 00:16:07,372
﻿We'll miss the deadline.

196
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:09,802
﻿Who are they?

197
00:16:11,574 --> 00:16:12,614
﻿The new interns.

198
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:19,663
﻿Those over there are precision scales.

199
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:23,968
﻿The...

200
00:16:24,664 --> 00:16:28,308
﻿-Where is the tall one?
-In Marketing.

201
00:16:28,448 --> 00:16:29,592
She has good references.

202
00:16:56,154 --> 00:16:58,653
﻿Of course we'll solve it,
let's just calm down.

203
00:16:58,758 --> 00:17:00,945
﻿What do I do with the processors now?

204
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,674
﻿Send them back?

205
00:17:01,814 --> 00:17:05,528
﻿I can't assemble them,
I have ten men standing around here.

206
00:17:05,703 --> 00:17:09,173
﻿-What's the problem?
-We're missing the deadlines.

207
00:17:10,147 --> 00:17:12,646
﻿There are... inaccuracies.

208
00:17:12,786 --> 00:17:14,381
﻿We make scales, we can't afford

209
00:17:14,522 --> 00:17:17,159
﻿inaccuracies.
When is that shipment due?

210
00:17:17,264 --> 00:17:19,104
﻿It needs to be in the warehouse
on Friday.

211
00:17:19,278 --> 00:17:21,777
﻿-Friday?
-They can't do shifts?

212
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,138
﻿My people don't like.doing shifts.

213
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:25,909
They're not your people,
they're my people.

214
00:17:26,048 --> 00:17:27,228
﻿Or do you pay them?

215
00:17:27,889 --> 00:17:29,138
﻿We won't make it.

216
00:17:29,277 --> 00:17:31,776
﻿We will, I'm telling you.
We work

217
00:17:31,881 --> 00:17:34,346
﻿Thursday night,
leave early Friday morning,

218
00:17:34,485 --> 00:17:35,804
﻿there by lunchtime.

219
00:17:35,943 --> 00:17:38,478
﻿We'd have to put it on a plane.

220
00:17:38,617 --> 00:17:40,144
﻿It will cost more than we make.

221
00:17:40,805 --> 00:17:44,796
﻿Do the numbers, if they don't work,
tell Sales to let them know.

222
00:17:44,937 --> 00:17:47,227
﻿-Miralles, do me a favor...
-Sorry.

223
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:49,310
﻿It's important.

224
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:53,129
﻿Hey, can you hear me?
Listen, we need to talk.

225
00:17:54,103 --> 00:17:55,420
﻿I'm not checking up on you.

226
00:17:55,561 --> 00:17:58,545
﻿He sent a truck this morning
to a fair in Frankfurt

227
00:17:58,686 --> 00:18:00,628
﻿with the wrong shipment.
Electronics

228
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:03,857
﻿won't even talk to him.
It's like this every day.

229
00:18:05,595 --> 00:18:07,642
﻿-Where are you going, dumbshit?
-There he is.

230
00:18:08,858 --> 00:18:09,864
﻿What are you doing?

231
00:18:09,969 --> 00:18:12,364
﻿Watch where you're going, damn it!

232
00:18:13,615 --> 00:18:15,905
﻿Book me a table for two tonight.

233
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,190
﻿El Rancho?

234
00:18:17,295 --> 00:18:19,239
﻿At El Rancho, yes.

235
00:18:19,344 --> 00:18:21,009
﻿Can you see right through me
or what?

236
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,924
﻿Salva!

237
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:52,708
﻿Hi, sweetheart.

238
00:18:53,439 --> 00:18:56,320
﻿I won't be home for dinner.
I'm having problems with Miralles

239
00:18:56,425 --> 00:18:57,465
﻿and I need to talk to him.

240
00:18:57,605 --> 00:18:59,062
﻿Do you know him?

241
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:00,764
﻿He's Fortuna's kid.

242
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:06,215
﻿I promised his dad I'd help him out

243
00:19:07,257 --> 00:19:09,756
﻿and I thought that maybe

244
00:19:09,896 --> 00:19:11,805
﻿you can give him deliveries,

245
00:19:11,945 --> 00:19:13,506
﻿-errands...
-I don't do deliveries.

246
00:19:13,646 --> 00:19:16,631
﻿Just keep him busy
and out of trouble.

247
00:19:17,639 --> 00:19:19,894
﻿Can't you keep it at the factory?

248
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,769
﻿Yes...

249
00:19:21,874 --> 00:19:24,894
﻿I will, after the committee visit.

250
00:19:31,665 --> 00:19:32,671
﻿Not smart.

251
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,775
﻿Mr. Blanco, welcome.
How are you?

252
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,643
﻿Fine.

253
00:19:43,748 --> 00:19:44,962
﻿-Your boy?
-Great.

254
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:45,934
﻿Good.

255
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:49,303
﻿-Hey, what's up?
-How are you?

256
00:19:50,484 --> 00:19:51,663
﻿Hello.

257
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:01,350
﻿-How is everything?
-Better, better. All fixed.

258
00:20:02,428 --> 00:20:04,475
﻿What's fixed?

259
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,552
﻿The delivery today.

260
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,843
﻿I screwed up,

261
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:09,370
﻿but it's fixed.

262
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,120
﻿The new shipment is on its way,
they meet halfway,

263
00:20:13,261 --> 00:20:15,203
﻿switch the shipments, no big deal.

264
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:16,731
﻿Miralles...

265
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:20,724
﻿Miralles, how long have we been
together

266
00:20:20,829 --> 00:20:22,356
﻿making scales. 20?

267
00:20:24,162 --> 00:20:25,134
﻿22 years.

268
00:20:26,453 --> 00:20:31,175
﻿To me you're not an employee,
that's the first ten years.

269
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:33,327
﻿After ten years

270
00:20:33,468 --> 00:20:35,758
﻿you become something else,
a friend, a brother...

271
00:20:36,453 --> 00:20:38,327
﻿I don't give a shit

272
00:20:38,884 --> 00:20:40,618
﻿about the shipment.

273
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:43,049
﻿That can happen to anyone.

274
00:20:43,536 --> 00:20:46,139
﻿What I care about is you.

275
00:20:47,008 --> 00:20:49,646
﻿You say you're fine
and you don't look fine,

276
00:20:49,751 --> 00:20:51,659
﻿Miralles, you look...

277
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,416
﻿You look bad, you look sad...

278
00:20:57,077 --> 00:21:00,513
﻿Like your mind is elsewhere.
What's wrong?

279
00:21:00,618 --> 00:21:02,006
﻿I'm fine.

280
00:21:02,146 --> 00:21:03,533
﻿There's nothing wrong.

281
00:21:03,674 --> 00:21:05,408
﻿Don't treat me like a boss.

282
00:21:06,937 --> 00:21:09,749
﻿If you treat me like a boss,
I'll treat you like an employee.

283
00:21:09,888 --> 00:21:11,519
﻿Are we at the factory?

284
00:21:13,395 --> 00:21:15,720
﻿It's nothing, really.

285
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:29,713
﻿Remember that time...

286
00:21:29,853 --> 00:21:33,948
﻿Yeah, when our dads
went hunting together.

287
00:21:34,089 --> 00:21:36,031
﻿They used to hunt together,
remember that?

288
00:21:37,178 --> 00:21:38,739
﻿They hunted down a cousin of his.

289
00:21:40,373 --> 00:21:43,705
﻿And we went with them,
we were like ten years old.

290
00:21:44,088 --> 00:21:45,754
﻿And on the way back they left us

291
00:21:45,893 --> 00:21:49,434
﻿in the car and went for a drink,
remember?

292
00:21:50,094 --> 00:21:54,920
﻿And we got into a lot of trouble
because I grabbed the rifle...

293
00:21:56,656 --> 00:21:59,988
﻿and it went off and I almost hit

294
00:22:00,129 --> 00:22:02,419
﻿the dog.

295
00:22:03,184 --> 00:22:04,884
﻿Thank God I have bad aim.

296
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:08,217
﻿-Do you remember?
-I remember.

297
00:22:08,322 --> 00:22:09,919
﻿Who saved my ass that day?

298
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,460
﻿Tell me, who? Who?

299
00:22:16,446 --> 00:22:18,460
-I did.
-You.

300
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:22,626
﻿You took the blame to save me.

301
00:22:22,766 --> 00:22:27,244
﻿And your dad gave you a good beating,
that you remember.

302
00:22:27,696 --> 00:22:29,639
﻿Well, this is the same thing,

303
00:22:29,745 --> 00:22:31,236
﻿but I'm the one
who wants to help you.

304
00:22:31,966 --> 00:22:34,153
﻿So tell me what's wrong

305
00:22:34,293 --> 00:22:36,167
﻿and we'll find a solution.

306
00:22:41,168 --> 00:22:42,764
﻿My wife.

307
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:45,506
﻿Your wife. Did you have a fight?

308
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:47,555
﻿Yes. And also..

309
00:22:48,285 --> 00:22:49,534
﻿Well...

310
00:22:49,674 --> 00:22:50,541
﻿Also?

311
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,291
﻿She wants to leave.

312
00:22:54,431 --> 00:22:56,547
﻿Aurora? Where?

313
00:22:56,652 --> 00:23:00,089
﻿I don't know where,
she wants to leave in general.

314
00:23:00,194 --> 00:23:02,484
﻿Leave and not come back.

315
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:05,749
﻿-Dump me like a piece of shit.
-What are you saying?

316
00:23:06,305 --> 00:23:10,540
﻿I don't know what's wrong with her,
but she's acting weirder than ever.

317
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,206
﻿She comes and goes

318
00:23:12,346 --> 00:23:14,845
﻿whenever she wants
and hardly talks to me.

319
00:23:16,304 --> 00:23:20,712
﻿She says she needs air.
Do you understand that? "Air.

320
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:23,004
﻿I offer to take her to
the countryside and she says

321
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:25,956
﻿that's not the air she means,
she needs another kind of air.

322
00:23:27,207 --> 00:23:28,802
﻿What fucking air.

323
00:23:29,428 --> 00:23:33,177
﻿What the fuck should I do,
buy her a bottle of oxygen?

324
00:23:33,282 --> 00:23:36,372
﻿Okay, calm down.
Everything will be fine.

325
00:23:36,824 --> 00:23:39,322
﻿No, it won't. It will only get worse.

326
00:23:39,462 --> 00:23:43,315
﻿Balance, Miralles.
Balance is very important.

327
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:48,940
﻿We make scales, we know a little
about that.

328
00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:52,655
﻿So let's prove it.

329
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,064
﻿Bring us a bottle of wine.
A good one.

330
00:24:08,523 --> 00:24:09,529
﻿How's Miralles?

331
00:24:10,988 --> 00:24:11,925
﻿Normal.

332
00:24:12,655 --> 00:24:13,938
﻿Normal, bad.

333
00:24:14,738 --> 00:24:16,508
﻿His wife...

334
00:24:17,828 --> 00:24:20,396
﻿His wife told him that she needs air.

335
00:24:21,196 --> 00:24:24,632
﻿-Air?
-How do you interpret that?

336
00:24:26,022 --> 00:24:27,479
﻿She's with someone else.

337
00:24:29,425 --> 00:24:30,395
﻿Air?

338
00:24:39,702 --> 00:24:44,769
﻿TUESDAY

339
00:25:37,684 --> 00:25:38,690
﻿BLANCO, THIEF

340
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:41,155
﻿Hey! Hey!

341
00:25:41,295 --> 00:25:44,245
﻿I've been calling you,
did they tell you?

342
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,391
﻿You see that?

343
00:25:45,531 --> 00:25:47,197
﻿Unbelievable.

344
00:25:48,031 --> 00:25:49,905
﻿I told him, eh?
The boss won't like it.

345
00:25:50,044 --> 00:25:51,814
﻿Blanco, I called you
on the telephone!

346
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,731
﻿Get him out of there
any way you can.

347
00:25:56,294 --> 00:25:58,202
﻿-I can't, boss.
-Why?

348
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:01,709
﻿That land doesn't belong to anyone,
it's not illegal for him to be there.

349
00:26:01,814 --> 00:26:03,654
﻿I won't let him in,
but I can't make him leave.

350
00:26:03,794 --> 00:26:06,709
﻿I want my job back, Blanco!

351
00:26:06,814 --> 00:26:10,701
﻿Look at my grave!
You killed me!

352
00:26:10,807 --> 00:26:12,993
-You killed me, Blanco!
-Come on!

353
00:26:13,098 --> 00:26:15,597
﻿Yes, you did!
Where are you going?

354
00:26:16,535 --> 00:26:17,993
﻿You killed us!

355
00:26:19,139 --> 00:26:21,847
﻿You killed us! Live with it!

356
00:26:23,688 --> 00:26:25,111
﻿-Are you okay?
-Yes.

357
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,124
﻿-Good morning.
-Good morning.

358
00:26:32,612 --> 00:26:33,929
﻿-Rubio.
-I heard.

359
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:38,200
﻿That individual can't be out there
when the committee comes.

360
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:41,012
﻿-We won't get the award.
-Let me talk to him.

361
00:26:41,153 --> 00:26:44,936
﻿You said "I'll handle it."
And look where he is now.

362
00:26:45,075 --> 00:26:46,498
﻿With banners.

363
00:26:47,575 --> 00:26:49,310
﻿What do the banners say?

364
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:52,748
﻿What banners always say.
Nothing good.

365
00:26:53,721 --> 00:26:55,873
﻿Maybe if we raise his severance pay...

366
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,477
﻿Okay, negotiate with him.

367
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,525
﻿-Give him double.
-Okay.

368
00:27:00,665 --> 00:27:04,656
﻿Get rid of him. It's not exactly
good for our image.

369
00:27:07,401 --> 00:27:10,281
﻿-Have you seen Miralles?
-I went down earlier

370
00:27:10,386 --> 00:27:12,156
﻿but he wasn't at his desk.

371
00:27:14,969 --> 00:27:17,434
﻿Miralles is not in good shape.

372
00:27:45,766 --> 00:27:46,807
﻿Aurora!

373
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,481
﻿How are you?

374
00:28:04,828 --> 00:28:06,181
﻿You can blindfold me

375
00:28:06,981 --> 00:28:11,423
﻿and put a prune in one hand
and a peach in the other,

376
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,714
﻿can tell you which is which
from the weight.

377
00:28:13,855 --> 00:28:15,729
﻿And the 1100 is the same.

378
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:18,818
﻿Because it has 800 photo-sensors,

379
00:28:18,924 --> 00:28:19,895
﻿this size, it's amazing.

380
00:28:20,035 --> 00:28:23,228
﻿It hasn't made it here yet,
it will change your lives.

381
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:26,283
﻿I really don't care.

382
00:28:27,152 --> 00:28:29,547
﻿I supervise the cash registers...

383
00:28:29,687 --> 00:28:31,978
﻿Right, of course.

384
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,567
﻿Did my husband say something?

385
00:28:44,062 --> 00:28:46,212
﻿Was he supposed to?

386
00:28:46,353 --> 00:28:47,636
﻿He didn't send you?

387
00:28:47,776 --> 00:28:49,893
﻿No, on the contrary.
He doesn't even know I came.

388
00:28:50,033 --> 00:28:53,643
﻿Please don't say anything,
he'll kill me. He's very jealous.

389
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,628
﻿No, no.

390
00:28:57,949 --> 00:29:00,344
﻿He's not... well.

391
00:29:00,483 --> 00:29:01,594
﻿He doesn't seem well.

392
00:29:02,254 --> 00:29:03,469
﻿I'm worried about him.

393
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,656
﻿Does he look okay to you?

394
00:29:06,733 --> 00:29:07,948
﻿I don't see him much.

395
00:29:08,852 --> 00:29:10,898
﻿He gets home late from work and...

396
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,773
﻿I leave early in the morning.

397
00:29:12,878 --> 00:29:17,114
﻿The thing is, we're going

398
00:29:17,844 --> 00:29:20,725
﻿through a difficult moment.

399
00:29:21,732 --> 00:29:24,647
﻿A lot is happening this month.
Inspections,

400
00:29:24,753 --> 00:29:26,210
﻿technical checks,

401
00:29:26,351 --> 00:29:28,606
﻿we had to lay people off
and it's causing

402
00:29:28,711 --> 00:29:31,626
﻿a lot of pain, especially for me...

403
00:29:31,731 --> 00:29:36,141
﻿And we can't afford to have him
working at half speed.

404
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:38,813
﻿My husband?

405
00:29:39,301 --> 00:29:42,042
﻿And problems between a couple

406
00:29:42,183 --> 00:29:46,313
﻿are normal, who doesn't have them?
What movies tell you...

407
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:47,390
﻿Well...

408
00:29:47,946 --> 00:29:49,542
﻿That's a lie.

409
00:29:50,272 --> 00:29:52,320
﻿I have problems.

410
00:29:52,425 --> 00:29:54,541
﻿Call my wife, she'll tell you.
Shall we call her?

411
00:29:54,682 --> 00:29:55,514
﻿No.

412
00:29:57,146 --> 00:29:59,264
﻿That's why supporting each other
is important.

413
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,556
﻿You have to be there.

414
00:30:01,695 --> 00:30:03,916
﻿When things are bad because..

415
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:05,687
﻿Are you there?

416
00:30:05,792 --> 00:30:06,972
﻿Am I where?

417
00:30:07,111 --> 00:30:08,465
﻿There, behind...

418
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:11,415
﻿your husband, supporting him.

419
00:30:16,139 --> 00:30:18,602
﻿We're not going through
our best moment.

420
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:19,644
﻿I could tell.

421
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:21,138
Maybe...

422
00:30:22,423 --> 00:30:23,846
﻿Maybe...?

423
00:30:24,264 --> 00:30:26,693
﻿Maybe we both need some air.

424
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:28,914
﻿Air?

425
00:30:29,402 --> 00:30:30,234
﻿Air.

426
00:30:30,894 --> 00:30:33,706
﻿Breathe a little, get some oxygen.

427
00:30:33,846 --> 00:30:37,109
﻿Air, right, I got it.
I know what air is.

428
00:30:37,214 --> 00:30:38,289
﻿Aurora,

429
00:30:38,706 --> 00:30:42,212
﻿I shouldn't meddle in your lives,
but I'm older.

430
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:45,094
﻿And old people are right
about some things.

431
00:30:45,789 --> 00:30:48,705
﻿Give yourself a few weeks, please.

432
00:30:49,122 --> 00:30:50,927
﻿And then you'll see.

433
00:30:51,553 --> 00:30:52,628
﻿But...

434
00:30:52,803 --> 00:30:55,857
﻿please promise me
you'll both try.

435
00:30:55,963 --> 00:30:58,912
﻿And don't make any decision
until the end of the month.

436
00:31:01,587 --> 00:31:03,704
﻿-I have to get back.
-Hey, look.

437
00:31:03,844 --> 00:31:06,308
﻿Whatever happened,

438
00:31:06,413 --> 00:31:10,301
﻿you can work it out.
We all make mistakes.

439
00:31:13,149 --> 00:31:14,606
﻿Did he tell you?

440
00:31:15,024 --> 00:31:16,203
﻿Tell me what?

441
00:31:16,344 --> 00:31:17,697
﻿About his affair.

442
00:31:17,766 --> 00:31:21,238
﻿With your secretary.
Three months in hotels.

443
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:24,293
﻿What?

444
00:31:55,264 --> 00:31:56,236
Inés.

445
00:32:06,028 --> 00:32:07,693
﻿-Yes?
-Shut the door.

446
00:32:09,569 --> 00:32:10,574
﻿Listen, Inés...

447
00:32:13,075 --> 00:32:14,498
﻿Is there something...

448
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:20,297
﻿that you think I don't know, but...

449
00:32:20,923 --> 00:32:22,240
﻿that maybe...

450
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:25,505
﻿I should know?

451
00:32:26,582 --> 00:32:27,900
﻿About what?

452
00:32:30,922 --> 00:32:32,067
﻿Is there?

453
00:32:36,095 --> 00:32:38,004
﻿I was going to bring it back
on Monday.

454
00:32:39,151 --> 00:32:40,330
﻿The printer.

455
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:44,288
﻿It's for my son, he has
to turn in a paper on Friday

456
00:32:44,428 --> 00:32:47,829
﻿and since we barely use it here...

457
00:32:48,281 --> 00:32:49,878
﻿But I'll bring it back tomorrow.

458
00:32:50,955 --> 00:32:53,836
﻿That's okay.
Bring it back on Monday.

459
00:33:32,758 --> 00:33:36,715
We make between
600 and 900 units per year.

460
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:40,673
﻿Some weigh up to 3,000 kilos.

461
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:44,006
﻿Pretend I'm not here.
Good afternoon.

462
00:33:44,632 --> 00:33:46,193
﻿They weigh boxes, packages,

463
00:33:46,334 --> 00:33:50,672
﻿nearly all the models
have ramps for trolleys...

464
00:33:51,438 --> 00:33:53,380
﻿These are for cattle.

465
00:33:53,486 --> 00:33:57,547
﻿Resistant to dents, acid, detergent...

466
00:33:57,652 --> 00:34:01,192
﻿They're specially treated
against corrosion

467
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:02,859
﻿and have four cargo cells.

468
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,679
﻿You don't need one of these
in the bathroom.

469
00:34:07,999 --> 00:34:10,879
﻿And you're wondering
why we need to know all this.

470
00:34:10,985 --> 00:34:12,546
﻿I'm wondering too.

471
00:34:13,172 --> 00:34:16,019
﻿To sell the product
we have to get to know it first.

472
00:34:16,158 --> 00:34:17,269
﻿-That's right.
-Exactly.

473
00:34:17,859 --> 00:34:21,643
﻿-How much do you weigh?
-57.

474
00:34:21,783 --> 00:34:24,143
﻿Get on, I'll show you something.

475
00:34:26,192 --> 00:34:28,622
﻿I don't know how I would take
if they put me

476
00:34:28,727 --> 00:34:31,191
﻿on a scale for cattle.

477
00:34:31,331 --> 00:34:33,864
﻿-How much do you offer for me?
-Nothing.

478
00:34:34,004 --> 00:34:36,330
﻿You work for me,
you're already my property.

479
00:34:36,782 --> 00:34:38,413
﻿56,800.

480
00:34:38,587 --> 00:34:41,086
Angela, can you step on too, please?

481
00:34:41,191 --> 00:34:43,794
﻿It has a weight accumulation function...

482
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:00,980
﻿No way, there's no deal!

483
00:35:02,648 --> 00:35:05,251
﻿My job! No deal!

484
00:35:05,356 --> 00:35:06,362
﻿He said no.

485
00:35:06,746 --> 00:35:09,765
﻿He doesn't want money,
he wants his job back.

486
00:35:10,287 --> 00:35:12,091
﻿He can't pay his mortgage,

487
00:35:12,196 --> 00:35:14,557
﻿the bank is taking his home
and he's staying there.

488
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,994
<i>﻿Hire back the fired!</i>

489
00:35:18,133 --> 00:35:19,556
<i>﻿Hire back...</i>

490
00:35:19,661 --> 00:35:21,083
﻿Just what we needed.

491
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,382
﻿The kid is in my daughter's class.

492
00:35:25,841 --> 00:35:26,847
﻿The kids..

493
00:35:28,723 --> 00:35:30,840
﻿Can he have them there?
Is that legal?

494
00:35:30,945 --> 00:35:34,243
﻿He and his wife alternate
and this week they're with him.

495
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:39,763
<i>﻿That's right!
Hire back the fired!</i>

496
00:35:52,332 --> 00:35:53,443
﻿How's the kid?

497
00:35:56,847 --> 00:35:59,241
﻿Bad, because his friends
come to see him,

498
00:35:59,381 --> 00:36:02,470
﻿they gather outside the door
and smoke...

499
00:36:02,888 --> 00:36:04,275
﻿People get scared away

500
00:36:04,415 --> 00:36:05,872
﻿and don't come in, of course.

501
00:36:13,929 --> 00:36:17,504
﻿I remembered earlier what
I had to tell you but I forgot again.

502
00:36:19,275 --> 00:36:21,011
﻿I should have written it down.

503
00:36:24,275 --> 00:36:25,628
﻿Something about...

504
00:36:26,462 --> 00:36:28,406
﻿work or doctors?

505
00:36:33,511 --> 00:36:34,898
﻿What does he want?

506
00:36:35,802 --> 00:36:37,051
﻿Jesus!

507
00:36:40,906 --> 00:36:42,294
﻿What's up?

508
00:36:49,412 --> 00:36:51,634
﻿Look, there she is.

509
00:36:56,252 --> 00:36:59,202
﻿-That's illegal.
-It's on the Internet.

510
00:36:59,377 --> 00:37:01,910
﻿They use it to rescue people
lost in the mountains, it's called

511
00:37:02,085 --> 00:37:03,959
﻿"geo-localization."

512
00:37:04,064 --> 00:37:07,883
﻿It's called spying. You're not rescuing
anyone, you're spying on your wife.

513
00:37:07,988 --> 00:37:10,313
﻿You're invading her privacy, Miralles.

514
00:37:10,452 --> 00:37:13,091
﻿The one invading her privacy
is the son of a bitch in there.

515
00:37:13,821 --> 00:37:16,771
﻿It's a crime and she can
report you for this.

516
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:18,992
﻿My God.

517
00:37:21,771 --> 00:37:23,992
﻿Are you sure she's in that house?

518
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:26,145
﻿I'm sure, I'm sure.

519
00:37:27,153 --> 00:37:29,999
﻿But we're checking to be
even more sure.

520
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,895
﻿She's moving, she's moving...

521
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:37,568
﻿I can't believe we're doing this.

522
00:37:37,742 --> 00:37:39,269
﻿Where is she going?

523
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:45,241
﻿-To the bathroom?
-What for?

524
00:37:46,111 --> 00:37:49,407
﻿Why the fuck are you going
to the bathroom? Stay in the living room!

525
00:37:49,548 --> 00:37:52,115
﻿That could be the bedroom.

526
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,477
﻿It looks like the back part
of a house.

527
00:37:54,686 --> 00:37:56,977
﻿-Damn it, Blanco.
-What?

528
00:37:57,116 --> 00:37:59,025
﻿Don't say it's the bedroom.

529
00:37:59,165 --> 00:38:00,310
﻿Why not?

530
00:38:00,449 --> 00:38:01,664
﻿You make it sound like
he's fucking her!

531
00:38:01,769 --> 00:38:03,921
﻿You're the one insisting
someone is fucking her.

532
00:38:04,026 --> 00:38:05,830
﻿And you're insisting someone isn't.

533
00:38:08,088 --> 00:38:10,587
﻿-Hey, look.
-What?

534
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:15,066
﻿She's going around in circles.

535
00:38:15,206 --> 00:38:19,371
﻿What the hell is that,
some kind of fucking ritual?

536
00:38:19,476 --> 00:38:21,732
﻿Let's go.
You don't need to be here.

537
00:38:21,872 --> 00:38:23,954
﻿You can do that at home too.

538
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:26,905
﻿-Who are the kids with?
-Alone, they're old enough.

539
00:38:27,045 --> 00:38:29,405
﻿They're not even 10 years old.

540
00:38:29,545 --> 00:38:31,523
﻿I'm taking you home,
wait for her there

541
00:38:31,663 --> 00:38:35,099
﻿and when she gets home
you can ask her anything you want.

542
00:38:35,795 --> 00:38:37,773
﻿If she's not already home.

543
00:38:38,537 --> 00:38:39,682
﻿It's moving real fast.

544
00:38:40,725 --> 00:38:43,362
﻿What are they doing,
having races?

545
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:56,834
﻿WEDNESDAY

546
00:38:59,127 --> 00:39:00,722
﻿Rider...

547
00:39:02,772 --> 00:39:04,021
﻿Spider...

548
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:08,985
﻿"You're like a spider."

549
00:39:11,452 --> 00:39:12,944
﻿A little weak.

550
00:39:15,444 --> 00:39:17,596
﻿"Blanco, slave driver,

551
00:39:17,736 --> 00:39:18,708
﻿you're a slave owner."

552
00:39:20,236 --> 00:39:23,395
﻿A little repetitive.

553
00:39:27,597 --> 00:39:28,603
"Hell."

554
00:39:28,743 --> 00:39:30,790
﻿"Blanco, slave driver
you will burn in hell."

555
00:39:30,896 --> 00:39:31,762
﻿That one is good.

556
00:39:32,943 --> 00:39:34,123
﻿Where's the rhyme?

557
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,449
﻿With driver.

558
00:39:36,867 --> 00:39:38,811
﻿The rhyme is assonant,
more modern.

559
00:39:39,541 --> 00:39:43,741
﻿It's a sign. It doesn't have to be modern,
it has to be efficient.

560
00:39:43,846 --> 00:39:46,483
﻿You don't think "you will burn in hell"
is efficient?

561
00:39:58,498 --> 00:39:59,955
﻿Having a chat?

562
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:04,538
﻿He has coffee. A machine with
capsules, like the commercial.

563
00:40:04,678 --> 00:40:07,246
﻿Great, like the commercial...

564
00:40:08,149 --> 00:40:10,475
﻿What do we do now,
start a social club?

565
00:40:12,524 --> 00:40:15,788
﻿If you like it so much, watch out,
you might end up over there too,

566
00:40:15,927 --> 00:40:16,863
﻿drinking coffee.

567
00:40:16,969 --> 00:40:20,509
﻿I don't want you talking to him,
in fact...

568
00:40:20,649 --> 00:40:22,106
﻿that man is...

569
00:40:23,427 --> 00:40:27,314
﻿boycotting the company that feeds you,
show a little loyalty.

570
00:40:27,975 --> 00:40:30,821
﻿Anyone who goes near him,
write their names down for me.

571
00:40:30,926 --> 00:40:32,245
﻿Like in grade school?

572
00:40:33,113 --> 00:40:34,779
﻿Like in grade school, yes.

573
00:40:34,884 --> 00:40:38,078
<i>﻿Blanco, listen up!
The people are not for sale!</i>

574
00:40:38,183 --> 00:40:41,307
<i>﻿Blanco, listen up!
The people are not for sale!</i>

575
00:40:41,446 --> 00:40:42,730
﻿He's not good at rhyming.

576
00:40:42,905 --> 00:40:44,848
<i>﻿Blanco, listen up!
The people are not for sale!</i>

577
00:40:44,988 --> 00:40:46,757
﻿Asshole.

578
00:40:47,696 --> 00:40:52,486
<i>﻿Blanco, listen!
The people aren't for sale!</i>

579
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:53,354
﻿What about that?

580
00:40:53,563 --> 00:40:55,507
﻿I called but they haven't come.

581
00:40:55,716 --> 00:40:57,139
﻿We make scales.

582
00:40:57,313 --> 00:41:00,785
We can't have a crooked one
at the front gate.

583
00:41:06,619 --> 00:41:09,186
<i>﻿Blanco. listen!</i>

584
00:41:09,327 --> 00:41:11,478
<i>﻿The people are not for sale!</i>

585
00:41:19,395 --> 00:41:20,609
<i>﻿Another coffee?</i>

586
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,151
﻿Police?

587
00:41:24,256 --> 00:41:26,685
﻿Look, I want to report
a dangerous situation

588
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:29,741
﻿at the entrance to the industrial
polygon

589
00:41:29,846 --> 00:41:32,380
﻿right across from the scale factory.

590
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:36,512
﻿There's been a vagabond
camped out there for a few days

591
00:41:36,651 --> 00:41:40,365
﻿with some kids,
I don't even know if they're his.

592
00:41:40,991 --> 00:41:42,309
﻿Young,

593
00:41:42,971 --> 00:41:46,545
﻿5 or 6 years old, not older.

594
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,948
﻿And the place is disgusting,
it's full of mud,

595
00:41:50,053 --> 00:41:52,795
﻿broken glass,
they could get bitten by a rat...

596
00:41:56,303 --> 00:42:00,399
﻿Thank you. A neighbor.
I drive by there every day

597
00:42:00,504 --> 00:42:03,141
﻿and it breaks my heart seeing

598
00:42:03,941 --> 00:42:06,440
﻿those helpless children.

599
00:42:08,073 --> 00:42:10,364
﻿It's urgent because
there are minors involved.

600
00:42:10,469 --> 00:42:13,593
﻿Yes, thank you, it's my duty.
Thank you.

601
00:42:14,219 --> 00:42:15,849
﻿Why are we stopped?

602
00:42:15,989 --> 00:42:17,307
﻿Miralles again.

603
00:42:18,003 --> 00:42:18,905
﻿But...

604
00:42:21,093 --> 00:42:23,696
﻿-What is our problem today?
-The micros.

605
00:42:23,801 --> 00:42:27,029
﻿The new batch isn't compatible
with the MS equipment software.

606
00:42:27,134 --> 00:42:28,175
We can't assemble them.

607
00:42:28,315 --> 00:42:31,022
﻿Miralles isn't picking up his phone.

608
00:42:31,127 --> 00:42:32,792
﻿Nobody told us anything.

609
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:35,779
﻿Can someone go to his house?

610
00:42:35,884 --> 00:42:38,417
﻿No, no, forget Miralles.

611
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:40,188
﻿Solutions.

612
00:42:42,723 --> 00:42:43,729
﻿Solutions!

613
00:42:45,501 --> 00:42:48,208
﻿We can use the platform scales.

614
00:42:48,383 --> 00:42:49,736
﻿They're compatible.

615
00:42:50,362 --> 00:42:54,632
﻿We can send the display models

616
00:42:55,188 --> 00:42:57,929
﻿and the rest two days later on...

617
00:42:59,528 --> 00:43:02,860
﻿Thursday, which is a holiday,
that gives us three days.

618
00:43:03,695 --> 00:43:05,256
﻿It won't take an hour.

619
00:43:06,229 --> 00:43:09,353
﻿I'll give you two and I'll buy
your whole team lunch.

620
00:43:09,458 --> 00:43:11,748
﻿The MS on the platform scales
aren't reliable.

621
00:43:11,888 --> 00:43:14,352
﻿What's for lunch?
That crap you eat with dates and seeds?

622
00:43:14,457 --> 00:43:17,373
﻿It's the fruit of paradise,
show some respect.

623
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:20,220
﻿Whenever we reassemble equipment
we have problems.

624
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,297
﻿I know.

625
00:43:21,714 --> 00:43:24,803
﻿You don't eat enough dates,
that's why you never get laid.

626
00:43:43,414 --> 00:43:44,559
﻿Damn.

627
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:01,884
﻿Let's see.

628
00:44:31,606 --> 00:44:34,694
﻿Find out if Khaled has
a parking spot, please.

629
00:44:38,897 --> 00:44:41,292
﻿This isn't my signature and without
my signature the trucks don't leave.

630
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:44,659
﻿So get the fucking truck back.

631
00:44:44,799 --> 00:44:47,471
﻿Then I'll decide if it leaves or not.

632
00:44:47,577 --> 00:44:49,659
﻿Miralles.

633
00:44:49,798 --> 00:44:54,207
﻿It was ready at AM.
My people were already there loading at 5.

634
00:44:54,347 --> 00:44:57,540
﻿I don't care, the truck doesn't leave
without my okay.

635
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,588
﻿The shipment has to be
in the warehouse by 10.

636
00:44:59,729 --> 00:45:02,054
﻿Don't tell me what I already know!

637
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:09,137
﻿Khaled...

638
00:45:09,867 --> 00:45:14,102
﻿Stick to your job, load the fucking
trucks and stay out

639
00:45:14,242 --> 00:45:15,421
﻿of my territory.

640
00:45:15,561 --> 00:45:17,018
﻿I don't load trucks,

641
00:45:17,158 --> 00:45:18,477
﻿I run Logistics.

642
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:20,664
﻿Khaled, I'm the Head of Production.

643
00:45:22,054 --> 00:45:23,337
﻿Get the truck back.

644
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:24,448
﻿Do it now!

645
00:45:28,511 --> 00:45:32,295
﻿They were trying to find you
all morning.

646
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,968
﻿Where have you been?
Tuck in your shirt.

647
00:45:35,074 --> 00:45:37,885
﻿Your shirt. You think you can make

648
00:45:38,372 --> 00:45:43,023
﻿a huge scene in front of everyone?
What if the committee were here?

649
00:45:43,164 --> 00:45:45,697
﻿Confirmed. She didn't come home
the whole night.

650
00:45:45,836 --> 00:45:49,308
﻿And she calls me in the morning
to say she slept at her sister's,

651
00:45:49,448 --> 00:45:51,287
﻿I go to her sister's

652
00:45:51,427 --> 00:45:53,058
﻿but she won't let me in
to see her,

653
00:45:53,163 --> 00:45:55,488
﻿that she's asleep.
Her sister!

654
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:57,120
﻿They can't stand each other.

655
00:46:00,419 --> 00:46:02,641
﻿-Tell me.
-Number 23.

656
00:46:02,746 --> 00:46:03,543
﻿Okay.

657
00:46:07,259 --> 00:46:09,133
﻿Stay here. Don't move.

658
00:46:09,655 --> 00:46:11,945
﻿Don't do anything.

659
00:46:12,085 --> 00:46:12,952
Don't talk to her, give me your phone.

660
00:46:13,092 --> 00:46:15,661
﻿-Damn, Blanco.
-It's the company's, give it to me.

661
00:46:18,474 --> 00:46:21,007
﻿And don't make any plans tonight.
Tell your wife you're coming out with me.

662
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:25,243
﻿Let's see if I can get you to relax
and forget about all of this.

663
00:46:59,200 --> 00:46:59,997
﻿Fuck!

664
00:47:01,457 --> 00:47:02,220
﻿Blanco!

665
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,622
﻿The police are outside.

666
00:47:47,149 --> 00:47:49,578
﻿"You will burn in hell."

667
00:47:50,656 --> 00:47:51,904
﻿What an idiot.

668
00:47:52,843 --> 00:47:54,959
﻿Well, the phrase isn't bad.

669
00:47:55,864 --> 00:47:58,084
﻿Maybe in this context,
but in another...

670
00:48:00,411 --> 00:48:01,800
﻿It's an assonant rhyme.

671
00:48:01,905 --> 00:48:04,508
﻿What are you now,
the poet security guard?

672
00:48:07,043 --> 00:48:08,153
﻿Thank you.

673
00:48:08,293 --> 00:48:08,987
﻿-Take care.
-Goodbye.

674
00:48:09,126 --> 00:48:11,313
﻿Come back if you want more coffee.

675
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:13,534
﻿-What's up?
-It's all good.

676
00:48:13,952 --> 00:48:16,486
﻿What's good?
I don't see anything that's good.

677
00:48:16,626 --> 00:48:19,992
﻿The car registration checks out,
that lot doesn't belong to anyone.

678
00:48:20,133 --> 00:48:20,861
﻿We can't make him leave.

679
00:48:21,001 --> 00:48:23,916
﻿Everything belongs to someone.

680
00:48:24,021 --> 00:48:27,423
﻿Have you found the owner?
I don't think he would like

681
00:48:27,528 --> 00:48:28,777
﻿that individual being there.

682
00:48:28,882 --> 00:48:32,040
﻿It's public property, sir.
It's his as much as it's yours.

683
00:48:32,146 --> 00:48:35,269
﻿Wow, a socialist police officer.

684
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,422
﻿What about the kids?

685
00:48:37,874 --> 00:48:40,339
﻿Can they be there?
Is that legal?

686
00:48:40,999 --> 00:48:42,526
﻿There's broken glass.

687
00:48:42,666 --> 00:48:43,602
﻿And rats.

688
00:48:45,062 --> 00:48:48,151
﻿Does the mother know?
Or do I have to call her too?

689
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:51,449
﻿Talk to Social Services.
There's nothing else we can do.

690
00:49:05,338 --> 00:49:07,351
﻿Maybe we can buy it.

691
00:49:08,532 --> 00:49:10,788
﻿-The land.
-What about the committee?

692
00:49:11,206 --> 00:49:13,983
﻿-I'll check.
-You said he was harmless.

693
00:49:14,157 --> 00:49:17,697
<i>﻿Blanco, that's right!
The people will always fight!</i>

694
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:20,197
<i>﻿Blanco, that's right!</i>

695
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:22,662
﻿That one rhymes.

696
00:49:24,364 --> 00:49:27,836
<i>﻿Blanco, that's right!
The people will always fight!</i>

697
00:49:28,045 --> 00:49:32,141
<i>﻿Blanco, that's right!
The people will always fight!</i>

698
00:49:51,828 --> 00:49:53,111
﻿Need a ride?

699
00:49:54,502 --> 00:49:56,063
﻿It's not a good idea.

700
00:49:56,203 --> 00:49:59,361
﻿Because I own the company
and you're an intern?

701
00:50:00,127 --> 00:50:01,861
﻿That's exactly why.

702
00:50:02,626 --> 00:50:04,847
﻿Yeah, well...

703
00:50:05,299 --> 00:50:07,139
﻿What am I supposed to do then?

704
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:10,055
﻿Sell the company
so I can give you a ride?

705
00:50:11,619 --> 00:50:12,972
﻿I will, eh?

706
00:50:16,236 --> 00:50:17,068
﻿Come on.

707
00:50:26,444 --> 00:50:28,874
﻿She doesn't work with me!

708
00:50:28,979 --> 00:50:30,749
﻿We just met!

709
00:50:44,811 --> 00:50:45,921
﻿Is this normal?

710
00:50:46,061 --> 00:50:47,691
﻿Is what normal?

711
00:50:48,595 --> 00:50:51,060
﻿For the owner of the company
to visit the interns,

712
00:50:51,442 --> 00:50:53,594
﻿to give them a ride home
in his car...

713
00:50:56,790 --> 00:51:01,614
﻿It's just that I don't like being locked up
in my office alone,

714
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,885
﻿I want to be around my employees,
take care of them all, because...

715
00:51:07,066 --> 00:51:09,981
﻿they're my family, you know?

716
00:51:10,851 --> 00:51:14,634
﻿The interns are my like my daughters.

717
00:51:14,774 --> 00:51:15,746
﻿Is that wrong?

718
00:51:19,982 --> 00:51:23,071
﻿-On the right.
-I know the way.

719
00:51:23,489 --> 00:51:25,363
﻿I picked out these apartments.

720
00:51:27,481 --> 00:51:29,425
﻿Do you like yours?
Are you comfortable?

721
00:51:31,301 --> 00:51:33,245
﻿A little big for a girl by herself.

722
00:51:41,891 --> 00:51:43,521
﻿Take down my number.

723
00:51:43,626 --> 00:51:45,640
﻿If you need anything,

724
00:51:45,779 --> 00:51:46,681
﻿call me.

725
00:51:49,946 --> 00:51:50,882
﻿Go ahead.

726
00:52:02,688 --> 00:52:04,527
﻿Hi, sweetheart. How are you?

727
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:09,006
﻿Can you take all of this home?
It's lingerie.

728
00:52:09,702 --> 00:52:10,464
﻿Okay.

729
00:52:10,604 --> 00:52:13,659
﻿I had him organize the storeroom,
it was in chaos.

730
00:52:16,264 --> 00:52:17,513
﻿I remember what I had to tell you.

731
00:52:17,652 --> 00:52:20,185
﻿I can't right now,
Miralles is waiting for me.

732
00:52:20,291 --> 00:52:23,380
﻿I'm trying to straighten him out,

733
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,088
﻿he's in a rut, he's..

734
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:28,518
﻿Salva!

735
00:52:37,026 --> 00:52:40,220
﻿Let's go.
These are the last ones?

736
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:58,031
﻿We have to be strong
and get through this thing.

737
00:53:01,712 --> 00:53:02,961
﻿I want to know who he is.

738
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:05,218
﻿What for, it's better if you don't.

739
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:08,343
﻿It's just a guy. Mister X.
It doesn't matter who he is.

740
00:53:08,482 --> 00:53:09,419
﻿Mister X..

741
00:53:10,183 --> 00:53:11,398
﻿Mister P.

742
00:53:11,503 --> 00:53:12,717
﻿It's a figure of speech.

743
00:53:13,448 --> 00:53:14,974
﻿Mister P, better.

744
00:53:15,114 --> 00:53:18,307
﻿Mister P, then. We don't care.

745
00:53:18,724 --> 00:53:22,230
﻿Trust me, complete disregard.

746
00:53:22,336 --> 00:53:26,154
﻿You're right.

747
00:53:27,301 --> 00:53:29,904
﻿We don't give a shit. Right?

748
00:53:30,009 --> 00:53:32,959
﻿-Careful.
-I don't care who you are, Mister P.

749
00:53:34,314 --> 00:53:37,403
﻿Mister P for "Prick."

750
00:53:37,543 --> 00:53:40,771
﻿For "Prick fucking punk."

751
00:53:41,363 --> 00:53:43,028
﻿No, no, no...

752
00:53:43,133 --> 00:53:45,320
﻿For "Punch your fucking..."

753
00:53:45,946 --> 00:53:48,236
﻿It's okay.

754
00:53:48,341 --> 00:53:49,833
﻿That's not what I mean.

755
00:53:49,972 --> 00:53:53,270
﻿Just ignore him.

756
00:53:53,375 --> 00:53:55,284
﻿Disregard.

757
00:53:55,424 --> 00:53:56,777
﻿-Disregard!
-That's it.

758
00:53:58,618 --> 00:54:00,423
﻿Disregard!

759
00:54:04,034 --> 00:54:05,491
﻿Make drawers in your mind.

760
00:54:07,298 --> 00:54:08,512
﻿Yeah.

761
00:54:08,687 --> 00:54:13,477
﻿Put your wife and whoever the guy is
in a drawer.

762
00:54:13,929 --> 00:54:15,352
﻿In the P drawer.

763
00:54:16,117 --> 00:54:17,818
﻿And the good things,

764
00:54:17,923 --> 00:54:19,310
﻿your job...

765
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:23,928
﻿the kids...
What do you like?

766
00:54:24,068 --> 00:54:26,705
﻿-Bullfighting.
-Bullfighting... In another.

767
00:54:26,845 --> 00:54:27,921
﻿Awesome.

768
00:54:29,345 --> 00:54:31,740
﻿How many drawers are there?

769
00:54:32,297 --> 00:54:34,517
﻿That doesn't matter,
they can be infinite.

770
00:54:34,623 --> 00:54:35,421
﻿As many as you want!

771
00:54:36,984 --> 00:54:38,441
﻿Infinite!

772
00:54:38,546 --> 00:54:42,295
﻿They're imaginary drawers, Miralles.
You don't have to carry them.

773
00:54:43,859 --> 00:54:44,795
﻿Come on.

774
00:54:55,212 --> 00:54:57,294
﻿-What's wrong now?
-Nothing.

775
00:54:59,031 --> 00:55:02,988
﻿I'm imagining them
in the same drawer, fucking and...

776
00:55:03,093 --> 00:55:06,217
﻿Damn it, Miralles.
Put them in different drawers.

777
00:55:07,051 --> 00:55:09,793
﻿There are plenty of women in the world,
more than men, millions.

778
00:55:09,933 --> 00:55:12,154
﻿You'll like one of them, Miralles.

779
00:55:12,294 --> 00:55:16,182
We always get hooked on just one,
it turns out there are more.

780
00:55:16,912 --> 00:55:17,882
﻿Go out,

781
00:55:18,752 --> 00:55:22,084
﻿meet another, fall in love.
There are lots here.

782
00:55:23,265 --> 00:55:26,007
﻿This girl sitting right here,
the Ukrainian.

783
00:55:26,112 --> 00:55:29,097
﻿I don't know if she can sew,
but look how pretty she is.

784
00:55:30,522 --> 00:55:33,680
﻿Take her up to a room,
it's on the company.

785
00:55:34,341 --> 00:55:35,381
﻿Here.

786
00:55:35,973 --> 00:55:38,229
﻿She's hotter than your wife.

787
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:41,214
﻿-Take two if you want.
-No, no.

788
00:55:41,355 --> 00:55:44,096
﻿We've been through
a lot of good things together.

789
00:55:44,202 --> 00:55:47,151
﻿And a lot of bad things,
you've told me about some.

790
00:55:47,257 --> 00:55:49,339
﻿I only want to be with my wife.

791
00:55:49,444 --> 00:55:52,291
﻿You're being too fussy.

792
00:55:52,777 --> 00:55:54,999
﻿Stop it, you have to be strong.

793
00:55:55,138 --> 00:55:57,186
﻿And also realize that sometimes

794
00:55:57,291 --> 00:56:00,067
﻿people can slip up.

795
00:56:02,846 --> 00:56:03,817
﻿Right?

796
00:56:04,651 --> 00:56:06,004
﻿Or are you totally free of blame?

797
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:12,150
﻿Look at these two!

798
00:56:13,124 --> 00:56:14,511
﻿What do you think?

799
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:21,628
﻿YOUR DAUGHTERS NEED HELP!

800
00:56:21,769 --> 00:56:25,518
﻿Calibration is used to determine
the precision

801
00:56:25,623 --> 00:56:28,469
﻿of the equipment and reduce
uncertainty to a minimum,

802
00:56:28,608 --> 00:56:31,836
﻿which is...
How would I explain it?

803
00:56:32,462 --> 00:56:36,350
﻿Whenever you measure something,
you introduce an alteration.

804
00:56:38,608 --> 00:56:40,760
﻿You modify what you're measuring.

805
00:56:41,594 --> 00:56:43,572
﻿Did I explain myself?
No.

806
00:56:44,857 --> 00:56:49,231
﻿Like if you want to know someone
and you actually never really know them

807
00:56:49,476 --> 00:56:51,662
﻿because when you get closer
the person changes.

808
00:56:51,802 --> 00:56:54,647
﻿Exactly, that's right.

809
00:56:54,752 --> 00:56:57,287
﻿When you get closer
you modify their behavior.

810
00:56:57,426 --> 00:57:01,938
﻿You just defined the Uncertainty
Principle better than Heisenberg.

811
00:57:02,912 --> 00:57:03,813
﻿You studied Physics...

812
00:57:04,683 --> 00:57:06,036
﻿Marketing.

813
00:57:06,176 --> 00:57:07,042
﻿Marketing, right.

814
00:57:07,634 --> 00:57:11,244
﻿I don't know Liliana, I know what
she's like when I'm with her.

815
00:57:11,384 --> 00:57:15,583
﻿She looks down, she covers her mouth,

816
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:18,396
﻿starts smiling, she could be
missing a tooth.

817
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:19,160
﻿Are you? No.

818
00:57:19,716 --> 00:57:21,868
﻿Do I cause all that?
I'd like to think

819
00:57:22,008 --> 00:57:24,124
﻿I do, but I don't know.

820
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:26,937
﻿I don't know Liliana, I know

821
00:57:27,042 --> 00:57:30,478
﻿this Liliana and who knows
what horrible

822
00:57:30,583 --> 00:57:32,353
﻿perverse things she does
when we don't see her.

823
00:57:32,494 --> 00:57:34,194
﻿It's better if you don't know.

824
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,311
﻿Well...

825
00:57:36,416 --> 00:57:37,597
﻿Maybe I'm not how I seem
either.

826
00:57:37,702 --> 00:57:40,686
﻿And there's a secret Angela
hidden out there somewhere.

827
00:57:41,556 --> 00:57:44,644
﻿That's why justice covers its eyes.

828
00:57:44,749 --> 00:57:46,936
﻿Not to be impartial.

829
00:57:47,041 --> 00:57:50,164
﻿It covers its eyes to not influence
what it judges.

830
00:57:50,305 --> 00:57:52,630
﻿I like having my eyes covered too.

831
00:57:55,617 --> 00:57:57,143
﻿I'm going home.

832
00:57:57,248 --> 00:57:58,984
﻿-No, you're not.
-Why not?

833
00:57:59,123 --> 00:58:02,699
﻿Because I said so, I'm your boss. Here.

834
00:58:03,255 --> 00:58:04,539
﻿Is he okay?

835
00:58:04,679 --> 00:58:05,233
﻿He's fine.

836
00:58:05,373 --> 00:58:08,046
﻿Remember, this goes in the drawer
with the good things.

837
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:11,449
﻿Did you know Miralles and I
have a scale inside?

838
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:13,149
﻿Here in our chest.

839
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:17,559
﻿Put your gin and tonic in one hand
and my drink

840
00:58:17,664 --> 00:58:20,058
﻿in the other and I'll tell you
which is which

841
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:22,906
﻿-with my eyes closed.
-No way.

842
00:58:25,684 --> 00:58:26,794
﻿This isn't easy.

843
00:58:26,934 --> 00:58:30,753
﻿This takes years of experience.
Here we go.

844
00:58:34,781 --> 00:58:35,856
﻿Let me put them at the same level.

845
00:58:36,795 --> 00:58:38,078
﻿This is my drink.

846
00:58:38,219 --> 00:58:39,572
﻿Cheater!

847
00:58:40,162 --> 00:58:41,411
﻿That's not fair.

848
00:58:41,552 --> 00:58:43,668
﻿It's liquid weight.

849
00:58:49,711 --> 00:58:51,376
﻿Here, take one of these.

850
00:58:52,385 --> 00:58:56,446
﻿This is nice lingerie my wife brings
from France.

851
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:03,529
﻿Please, just hurry up.
I'm not into mine.

852
00:59:03,668 --> 00:59:05,542
﻿Don't worry.

853
00:59:14,119 --> 00:59:15,263
﻿Let me see it.

854
00:59:54,047 --> 00:59:56,546
﻿I like you.
I've always liked you.

855
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:23,315
﻿That was pretty spectacular.

856
01:00:24,045 --> 01:00:26,509
﻿Where did you get all that repertoire?

857
01:00:27,413 --> 01:00:28,419
﻿I watch porn.

858
01:00:28,941 --> 01:00:30,190
﻿On the Internet.

859
01:00:30,329 --> 01:00:31,856
﻿Blessed Internet.

860
01:00:33,142 --> 01:00:36,786
﻿How is the wi-fi here?
If you need more megas let me know.

861
01:00:40,086 --> 01:00:42,481
﻿My sign is Libra.
The scale.

862
01:00:43,211 --> 01:00:44,737
﻿It's a sign.

863
01:00:46,613 --> 01:00:48,209
﻿We're balance and harmony.

864
01:00:50,953 --> 01:00:53,626
﻿But we're ruled by Venus.

865
01:00:54,148 --> 01:00:57,965
﻿-So balance goes to hell.
-Right.

866
01:01:01,508 --> 01:01:04,563
﻿And our ideal mate
is Capricorn or Virgo.

867
01:01:05,153 --> 01:01:06,506
﻿Are you Capricorn or Virgo?

868
01:01:06,611 --> 01:01:09,631
﻿I'm both.

869
01:01:09,736 --> 01:01:11,854
﻿Can I be both at the same time?

870
01:01:26,576 --> 01:01:28,172
﻿Someone waiting at home?

871
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:33,588
﻿What makes you think that?

872
01:01:43,519 --> 01:01:46,157
﻿Always thinking about
fucking other men...

873
01:01:46,296 --> 01:01:48,102
﻿-Miralles!
-We're just talking...

874
01:01:48,241 --> 01:01:51,122
﻿-Why do you do this to me?
-Miralles, please.

875
01:01:51,227 --> 01:01:53,066
﻿Get him out or I'm calling the police.

876
01:01:53,206 --> 01:01:55,948
﻿-It's not fair.
-I'll handle it, come on.

877
01:01:56,053 --> 01:01:57,545
﻿Talk to her.

878
01:01:57,650 --> 01:01:59,836
﻿Tell her please not to leave me.

879
01:01:59,941 --> 01:02:01,955
﻿Please, tell her not to leave me!

880
01:02:02,441 --> 01:02:05,184
﻿Talk to her, please!

881
01:02:05,983 --> 01:02:07,197
﻿All good.

882
01:02:14,351 --> 01:02:16,433
﻿What if she reports you?

883
01:02:18,899 --> 01:02:20,772
﻿I didn't do anything to her.

884
01:02:21,607 --> 01:02:25,912
﻿You were shouting like a madman,
insulting her...

885
01:02:26,017 --> 01:02:28,724
﻿If you cause the company
any trouble...

886
01:02:28,864 --> 01:02:30,182
﻿Her car is there.

887
01:02:31,294 --> 01:02:34,661
﻿Okay, that's a good thing.
Go on.

888
01:02:34,766 --> 01:02:37,021
﻿I'm scared of running into her.

889
01:02:37,127 --> 01:02:37,924
Fuck!

890
01:02:38,655 --> 01:02:41,952
﻿Everything scares you.
Her being home, her not being home....

891
01:02:42,057 --> 01:02:45,806
﻿You can't take things so hard,

892
01:02:46,258 --> 01:02:50,875
﻿we all make mistakes.
Look where you're coming from.

893
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:51,986
﻿Because you took me there.

894
01:02:52,126 --> 01:02:54,556
﻿Whatever the reason, you are,
so you're even.

895
01:02:54,695 --> 01:02:56,986
﻿Forgive each other and that's that.

896
01:02:57,125 --> 01:02:58,062
﻿Go on.

897
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:04,138
﻿Don't come to work tomorrow,
stay home.

898
01:03:04,278 --> 01:03:07,367
﻿It's time for you to accept
what's happening to you.

899
01:03:28,165 --> 01:03:29,241
﻿Fuck!

900
01:04:13,787 --> 01:04:17,363
﻿I know what I had to tell you.

901
01:04:18,406 --> 01:04:19,619
﻿Liliana.

902
01:04:20,662 --> 01:04:22,744
﻿Treat her like anyone else.

903
01:04:24,898 --> 01:04:27,431
﻿The Urbinas' little girl, remember?

904
01:04:29,411 --> 01:04:31,320
﻿The new intern, Liliana.

905
01:04:31,946 --> 01:04:34,896
﻿They asked us to give her
an internship for a few months.

906
01:04:35,036 --> 01:04:36,424
﻿Rings a bell.

907
01:04:36,564 --> 01:04:39,409
﻿She didn't want you to know,
she doesn't want special treatment.

908
01:04:39,515 --> 01:04:40,347
﻿Right.

909
01:04:40,487 --> 01:04:43,159
﻿She's really changed, you probably
didn't recognize her.

910
01:04:43,264 --> 01:04:45,799
﻿No, I didn't.

911
01:04:45,938 --> 01:04:48,680
﻿I talked to her mother today,
they're coming to see her.

912
01:04:49,688 --> 01:04:53,437
﻿You know what a nag she can be,
since she's an only child.

913
01:04:54,063 --> 01:04:56,179
﻿They're coming to dinner
tomorrow night.

914
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:05,866
﻿What should I make?

915
01:05:12,603 --> 01:05:17,636
﻿THURSDAY

916
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:25,101
﻿Have the new intern come up, Liliana.
Give me her resume.

917
01:05:25,241 --> 01:05:26,317
﻿Who has it?

918
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:29,129
﻿She's a friend of the family.
Why don't people tell me anything?

919
01:05:31,526 --> 01:05:34,684
﻿-Miralles hasn't shown up.
-Yeah, I told him not to come.

920
01:05:35,692 --> 01:05:38,676
﻿The less he's here right now,
the better.

921
01:05:39,927 --> 01:05:43,225
﻿-Any news about the committee?
-Nothing.

922
01:05:44,268 --> 01:05:45,586
﻿She didn't come in today.

923
01:05:48,052 --> 01:05:49,024
﻿Liliana?

924
01:06:11,349 --> 01:06:13,397
<i>﻿This is Liliana, leave a message...</i>

925
01:06:14,404 --> 01:06:15,445
﻿Aurora.

926
01:06:16,349 --> 01:06:17,598
﻿I need a minute.

927
01:06:17,738 --> 01:06:19,959
﻿-Just one minute.
-Blanco, not now, please.

928
01:06:20,099 --> 01:06:21,348
﻿One minute and I'll go.

929
01:06:22,529 --> 01:06:24,334
﻿-He'll give you the code, okay?
-Okay.

930
01:06:24,474 --> 01:06:25,653
﻿Come on.

931
01:06:31,591 --> 01:06:33,430
﻿Miralles is in very bad shape.

932
01:06:33,814 --> 01:06:35,860
﻿I've never seen him like this before.

933
01:06:35,966 --> 01:06:39,923
﻿And I'm scared he might do
something crazy, I think he's capable.

934
01:06:40,063 --> 01:06:43,047
﻿I'm asking you to take it
into account in your decisions.

935
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:47,145
﻿If not for him, do it

936
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:48,221
﻿for your children.

937
01:06:48,361 --> 01:06:49,749
﻿How dare you!

938
01:06:50,235 --> 01:06:53,568
﻿-Who are you to meddle in our life?
-It's your life,

939
01:06:53,673 --> 01:06:57,317
﻿but it's mine too, because what you do
affects me too.

940
01:06:57,423 --> 01:07:00,373
﻿And it affects my business,
deliveries, the award...

941
01:07:00,513 --> 01:07:01,380
<i>﻿Aurora,</i>

942
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,811
<i>﻿please return to register 6.</i>

943
01:07:03,916 --> 01:07:04,921
﻿Now.

944
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:06,588
﻿Our problems
are none of your business.

945
01:07:06,728 --> 01:07:11,761
I'm sorry, but if they hurt my company
they become my problems...

946
01:07:11,901 --> 01:07:12,456
<i>﻿Aurora, please...</i>

947
01:07:12,596 --> 01:07:14,852
﻿I'm coming, damn it!
Give me a fucking minute!

948
01:07:14,957 --> 01:07:19,052
﻿Look, there's an easy solution.
Just stop banging my employees.

949
01:07:21,623 --> 01:07:23,149
﻿I bang anyone I want.

950
01:07:56,413 --> 01:07:57,626
﻿Boss!

951
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:09,744
﻿What do you think?

952
01:08:15,022 --> 01:08:16,202
﻿The dress.

953
01:08:16,758 --> 01:08:17,937
﻿For dinner tonight.

954
01:08:18,042 --> 01:08:20,056
﻿I didn't bring anything formal.

955
01:08:20,161 --> 01:08:22,035
﻿And you know what my father is like.

956
01:08:25,786 --> 01:08:27,451
﻿He's older, like me.

957
01:08:28,494 --> 01:08:31,061
﻿We missed you at the factory today.

958
01:08:31,167 --> 01:08:32,763
﻿I told her not to go in.

959
01:08:32,937 --> 01:08:33,770
﻿Great.

960
01:08:34,291 --> 01:08:35,957
﻿And we're going
to the hairdresser's later.

961
01:08:36,098 --> 01:08:38,769
﻿Being the boss' favorite
has its perks.

962
01:08:38,874 --> 01:08:40,089
﻿You're telling me.

963
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:44,013
﻿Doesn't she look beautiful?

964
01:08:44,118 --> 01:08:45,158
﻿Gorgeous.

965
01:08:45,715 --> 01:08:47,415
﻿-Want to try the mint green?
-Yes.

966
01:08:52,728 --> 01:08:54,463
﻿-You didn't sleep enough last night.
-Yeah.

967
01:08:54,603 --> 01:08:57,414
﻿I need you to buy dessert
for dinner.

968
01:08:57,555 --> 01:08:58,908
﻿Will you go?

969
01:08:59,082 --> 01:08:59,914
﻿Yes.

970
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,011
﻿Very nice.

971
01:09:09,602 --> 01:09:10,678
﻿Will you take her?

972
01:09:12,762 --> 01:09:13,907
﻿I'll take her.

973
01:09:25,017 --> 01:09:28,801
﻿I didn't want privileges. If something
happened between us, it was meant to.

974
01:09:28,907 --> 01:09:30,745
﻿It wasn't meant to happen.

975
01:09:31,511 --> 01:09:33,974
﻿I'd hate for you to see me now
as the Urbinas' little girl.

976
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:36,509
﻿You are the Urbinas' little girl.

977
01:09:37,933 --> 01:09:40,572
﻿can't see you any other way.
I went to school

978
01:09:40,711 --> 01:09:43,973
﻿with your father and I carried you
in my arms, Liliana.

979
01:09:44,531 --> 01:09:45,640
﻿Good morning.

980
01:09:46,614 --> 01:09:49,911
﻿The Black Forest, large.

981
01:09:51,162 --> 01:09:52,342
﻿And..

982
01:09:52,864 --> 01:09:54,494
﻿the Russian pastry, please.

983
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:57,306
﻿There's something else
I didn't tell you.

984
01:09:57,411 --> 01:09:59,945
﻿Please, tell me everything,
always.

985
01:10:00,085 --> 01:10:01,959
﻿My boyfriend is coming
with my parents.

986
01:10:04,217 --> 01:10:05,882
﻿That makes everyone.

987
01:10:05,988 --> 01:10:07,826
﻿I know, I couldn't avoid it.

988
01:10:07,967 --> 01:10:10,674
﻿I didn't have time to explain
the new situation to him.

989
01:10:10,779 --> 01:10:13,278
﻿What new situation?

990
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:15,500
﻿This, the two of us together.

991
01:10:16,472 --> 01:10:19,319
﻿Don't worry, he's just a boy,
I'm not in love with him.

992
01:10:20,362 --> 01:10:22,861
﻿That's exactly what worries me.

993
01:10:27,167 --> 01:10:29,700
﻿Heisenberg was right.

994
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,610
﻿People change.

995
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:33,381
﻿I change when you're near me.

996
01:10:33,833 --> 01:10:35,637
﻿I'm someone else.
I don't recognize myself.

997
01:10:36,402 --> 01:10:37,928
﻿It's pretty scary.

998
01:10:39,249 --> 01:10:42,095
﻿Liliana, sweetie,

999
01:10:44,249 --> 01:10:47,511
﻿try to be yourself tonight.

1000
01:10:49,006 --> 01:10:53,900
﻿The same old Liliana,
with your parents and my wife.

1001
01:10:54,456 --> 01:10:55,636
﻿Can you do that?

1002
01:10:55,776 --> 01:10:56,677
﻿Sure you can

1003
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:58,865
﻿-You want the truth?
-Yes.

1004
01:10:59,456 --> 01:11:01,608
﻿This situation turns me on.

1005
01:11:03,797 --> 01:11:04,802
﻿Here you go.

1006
01:11:07,823 --> 01:11:09,246
﻿What do I owe you?

1007
01:11:09,386 --> 01:11:10,426
﻿-Forty.
-Forty.

1008
01:11:12,372 --> 01:11:14,038
﻿BLANCO
STOP LAYOFFS

1009
01:11:17,163 --> 01:11:19,801
﻿A little higher... higher...

1010
01:11:21,121 --> 01:11:22,196
﻿Brutal.

1011
01:11:24,663 --> 01:11:25,634
﻿Seduce me, come on.

1012
01:11:26,538 --> 01:11:28,412
Hold the banner up higher.

1013
01:11:30,114 --> 01:11:31,328
﻿Like this?

1014
01:11:31,468 --> 01:11:32,821
﻿Show me some truth.

1015
01:11:33,968 --> 01:11:35,841
﻿Great, brutal.

1016
01:11:35,982 --> 01:11:39,314
﻿-How about this?
-Brutal, I love it.

1017
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:47,924
﻿Blanco, tell him about the layoffs.

1018
01:11:48,029 --> 01:11:49,209
﻿If you have the balls.

1019
01:11:50,044 --> 01:11:51,188
﻿What's going on?

1020
01:11:51,328 --> 01:11:54,105
﻿He asked if I want to be
in the article too.

1021
01:11:54,244 --> 01:11:56,361
﻿I didn't say yes or no
until I talked to you first.

1022
01:11:58,341 --> 01:12:00,076
﻿-Good morning.
-Good morning.

1023
01:12:00,216 --> 01:12:01,673
﻿What are the photos for?

1024
01:12:01,778 --> 01:12:03,826
﻿-For an article.
-An article.

1025
01:12:03,966 --> 01:12:06,464
﻿-About what?
-About his struggle.

1026
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:08,027
﻿-About his...
-His struggle.

1027
01:12:08,167 --> 01:12:12,333
﻿His struggle, right.
Does your boss know you're doing this?

1028
01:12:13,375 --> 01:12:15,284
﻿It's a human interest story,
what people like now.

1029
01:12:15,423 --> 01:12:19,033
﻿It's an absurd story. There were layoffs,
he was paid according

1030
01:12:19,173 --> 01:12:21,984
﻿to the law.
There is no story, period.

1031
01:12:22,993 --> 01:12:24,276
﻿What are you doing?

1032
01:12:25,492 --> 01:12:27,019
﻿Writing down your statement.

1033
01:12:28,166 --> 01:12:29,311
﻿Let me see.

1034
01:12:32,505 --> 01:12:33,165
﻿It's not a statement.

1035
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:35,491
﻿What's wrong with you?
You can't print this now.

1036
01:12:35,630 --> 01:12:37,712
﻿Don't lean on my car, please.

1037
01:12:37,818 --> 01:12:41,150
﻿Were you put up to this
or was this article your idea?

1038
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:43,233
﻿That information is private.

1039
01:12:43,374 --> 01:12:46,115
﻿-I have to protect my sources.
-Sources, right.

1040
01:12:46,255 --> 01:12:48,893
﻿Who do you think you work for,
the Washington Post?

1041
01:12:49,033 --> 01:12:50,143
﻿Can I get a photo?

1042
01:12:50,282 --> 01:12:51,914
﻿Don't you dare. No way.

1043
01:12:52,019 --> 01:12:53,997
﻿And not the factory either.
Román.

1044
01:12:54,102 --> 01:12:55,351
﻿Don't let him take photos here.

1045
01:12:56,462 --> 01:12:58,059
﻿What about from across the street?

1046
01:12:58,754 --> 01:13:02,156
﻿I thought security guards take an oath.
Did you swear to be an idiot?

1047
01:13:02,295 --> 01:13:04,413
﻿If I see a single photo

1048
01:13:04,518 --> 01:13:08,058
﻿of the factory in the paper,
you're fired.

1049
01:13:15,247 --> 01:13:16,564
﻿Freedom of the press.

1050
01:13:19,031 --> 01:13:20,141
<i>﻿Ignacio?</i>

1051
01:13:21,322 --> 01:13:23,751
﻿Listen, there was a kid here,

1052
01:13:23,892 --> 01:13:26,251
﻿the one who did the article
last week.

1053
01:13:28,267 --> 01:13:30,869
﻿Look, I respect all that

1054
01:13:30,975 --> 01:13:33,855
﻿about it being a human story.

1055
01:13:33,995 --> 01:13:37,432
﻿He's not a dog or a cow,
he's a man, so it's definitely human.

1056
01:13:37,953 --> 01:13:39,167
﻿But...

1057
01:13:40,037 --> 01:13:45,452
﻿But you need to understand
that this week is complicated.

1058
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:51,493
﻿We have the award thing,
you printed a story about it.

1059
01:13:51,598 --> 01:13:53,333
﻿Yes...

1060
01:13:53,786 --> 01:13:57,812
﻿And that photo is not helping right now.

1061
01:14:03,785 --> 01:14:06,873
﻿Ignacio, we're here to help
each other, you always say that:

1062
01:14:06,979 --> 01:14:08,853
﻿"I help you and you help me."

1063
01:14:11,041 --> 01:14:14,061
﻿Yeah, a healthy democracy.

1064
01:14:14,201 --> 01:14:16,352
﻿I'm fucking sick of healthy democracy.

1065
01:14:16,493 --> 01:14:19,477
﻿Everyone is healthy and free,
but what about my health?

1066
01:14:19,895 --> 01:14:21,700
﻿That doesn't count?

1067
01:14:22,534 --> 01:14:23,609
﻿Ignacio.

1068
01:14:24,513 --> 01:14:27,324
﻿Ignacio! Fuck, I'm losing you.

1069
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:32,150
﻿Look, I told you what I think,
from here it's up to you.

1070
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:36,351
﻿I can't hear you, damn it.
Ignacio!

1071
01:14:36,977 --> 01:14:38,538
﻿She's the wife of a coworker.

1072
01:14:39,408 --> 01:14:40,761
﻿Excuse me?

1073
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:45,274
﻿She's the wife of a coworker
and I don't want you to see her again.

1074
01:14:45,935 --> 01:14:47,357
﻿That's my problem.

1075
01:14:47,497 --> 01:14:49,024
﻿Another one.

1076
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:53,190
﻿Do you people think only you have
problems and I don't?

1077
01:14:53,330 --> 01:14:56,141
﻿My problems are your
problems too, Khaled,

1078
01:14:56,282 --> 01:14:58,676
﻿and if things are bad for me,
they'll be even worse for you.

1079
01:14:58,816 --> 01:15:01,385
﻿If you have a problem with Miralles,
talk to him.

1080
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:03,641
﻿Look...

1081
01:15:08,746 --> 01:15:10,689
﻿You're hurting the company.

1082
01:15:10,829 --> 01:15:13,988
﻿So leave Aurora alone.

1083
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:16,140
﻿We're both adults

1084
01:15:16,281 --> 01:15:17,738
﻿and we like to fuck.

1085
01:15:17,843 --> 01:15:20,619
﻿I'm good at what I do,
I do my job well

1086
01:15:20,724 --> 01:15:22,946
﻿you pay me, end of story.

1087
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:24,369
﻿Look.

1088
01:15:24,995 --> 01:15:28,639
﻿That kind of behavior
is not allowed at Blanco Scales.

1089
01:15:29,301 --> 01:15:30,722
﻿It's not.

1090
01:15:31,661 --> 01:15:32,841
﻿What are you going to do?

1091
01:15:34,925 --> 01:15:36,695
﻿Fire me?

1092
01:15:37,806 --> 01:15:42,146
﻿Don't give me any of that family
crap, look at my skin.

1093
01:15:43,639 --> 01:15:44,924
﻿I'm not your son.

1094
01:16:06,450 --> 01:16:08,047
﻿Only missing an Oscar.

1095
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:12,977
﻿That one there is the Oscar of scales.

1096
01:16:14,089 --> 01:16:18,602
﻿Der Schöne Ritter. "The Just Knight."

1097
01:16:18,741 --> 01:16:22,282
﻿It's a German certification company.

1098
01:16:24,193 --> 01:16:25,684
﻿The one shaped like a scale?

1099
01:16:26,553 --> 01:16:28,115
﻿It's not a shape, it's a scale.

1100
01:16:28,255 --> 01:16:33,080
﻿And the open spot above it,
we'll be filling soon.

1101
01:16:33,219 --> 01:16:34,712
﻿We're finalists for another award.

1102
01:16:35,164 --> 01:16:37,246
﻿-Who gives it?
-The regional government.

1103
01:16:38,046 --> 01:16:39,954
﻿For excellence, which has to do

1104
01:16:40,164 --> 01:16:41,864
﻿with transparency, management...

1105
01:16:42,073 --> 01:16:46,204
﻿It's important for subsidies.

1106
01:16:46,344 --> 01:16:48,565
﻿Otherwise the artists hog them all.

1107
01:16:48,739 --> 01:16:49,676
﻿How exciting!

1108
01:16:49,781 --> 01:16:52,003
﻿-And how is it looking?
-Good.

1109
01:16:52,212 --> 01:16:55,162
We have some issues to work out.

1110
01:16:55,301 --> 01:16:56,759
﻿With your employees?

1111
01:16:56,864 --> 01:16:58,287
﻿They're not happy?

1112
01:16:58,426 --> 01:17:00,995
Employees are never happy.

1113
01:17:01,134 --> 01:17:04,536
﻿You raise someone's salary,
say 100 euros.

1114
01:17:05,405 --> 01:17:09,154
﻿And the next guy 50, half that.
So you make that guy more unhappy

1115
01:17:09,329 --> 01:17:11,168
﻿than if you hadn't given either
a raise.

1116
01:17:11,273 --> 01:17:12,244
Do you understand that?

1117
01:17:12,419 --> 01:17:14,987
﻿That's why he doesn't give raises
to anyone.

1118
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:19,257
﻿They're a mystery.

1119
01:17:19,883 --> 01:17:24,188
﻿You never really get to know
your employees.

1120
01:17:25,127 --> 01:17:27,000
﻿The Uncertainty Principle.

1121
01:17:27,174 --> 01:17:28,285
﻿Heisenberg.

1122
01:17:28,876 --> 01:17:29,881
﻿That's right.

1123
01:17:31,793 --> 01:17:32,902
﻿Scale stuff.

1124
01:17:34,570 --> 01:17:36,548
﻿Nothing is exactly the way
we perceive it.

1125
01:17:37,348 --> 01:17:38,770
﻿We aren't us.

1126
01:17:38,910 --> 01:17:39,951
﻿We change,

1127
01:17:40,368 --> 01:17:41,860
﻿depending on who's looking at us.

1128
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:43,978
﻿No?

1129
01:17:44,118 --> 01:17:45,784
﻿Yes, more or less.

1130
01:17:45,959 --> 01:17:49,464
I was thinking,
talk to Albert tomorrow.

1131
01:17:49,569 --> 01:17:51,999
﻿I need you two to prepare

1132
01:17:52,104 --> 01:17:55,366
﻿a full-page ad
for the local newspaper.

1133
01:17:55,541 --> 01:17:58,457
﻿-And the briefing?
-Urgent, that's the briefing.

1134
01:17:58,631 --> 01:18:03,004
﻿Exciting, isn't it?
Seeing you two work up close.

1135
01:18:04,568 --> 01:18:06,199
﻿How long will you be staying with us?

1136
01:18:06,408 --> 01:18:08,004
﻿Nothing, one month

1137
01:18:08,145 --> 01:18:11,060
﻿and she's gone. Mobility is good,
you have to keep moving.

1138
01:18:13,075 --> 01:18:14,185
﻿But she just got here.

1139
01:18:14,324 --> 01:18:17,899
﻿Yeah, but if you stay in one place
for too long you get stuck.

1140
01:18:18,074 --> 01:18:20,920
﻿I don't have any plans,
you can hire me if you want.

1141
01:18:22,241 --> 01:18:25,018
﻿It's always better to change companies.

1142
01:18:25,748 --> 01:18:27,656
﻿Different types, textiles, motor...

1143
01:18:27,795 --> 01:18:29,809
﻿Learn about everything.
We'll find her somewhere.

1144
01:18:29,983 --> 01:18:31,961
﻿It sounds like you wan
 to get rid of ter.

1145
01:18:33,108 --> 01:18:35,155
﻿Not get rid of her, stimulate her.

1146
01:18:35,365 --> 01:18:36,336
Stimulate her.

1147
01:18:37,309 --> 01:18:41,579
﻿If the job is good, great.
If it isn't, you move on.

1148
01:18:42,101 --> 01:18:44,183
﻿We don't want any favoritism,
do we?

1149
01:18:45,017 --> 01:18:47,272
﻿You and I never got anything
for free.

1150
01:18:47,413 --> 01:18:50,154
﻿-And we're not doing too bad.
-Exactly.

1151
01:18:50,294 --> 01:18:52,272
﻿Hard work and humiliity.

1152
01:18:53,767 --> 01:18:56,126
﻿Well, you inherited the factory
from your father.

1153
01:18:56,579 --> 01:18:58,696
﻿So did you, Jandro.

1154
01:18:58,871 --> 01:19:00,744
﻿Well, you have to be there.

1155
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:03,973
﻿Where, at the notary?
Because to inherit,

1156
01:19:04,599 --> 01:19:06,646
﻿that's all it takes.

1157
01:19:06,787 --> 01:19:10,396
﻿Inheriting is also a responsibility.

1158
01:19:10,397 --> 01:19:12,062
﻿Look at Liliana.

1159
01:19:12,203 --> 01:19:13,486
﻿She inherited her mother's beauty.

1160
01:19:13,904 --> 01:19:15,500
﻿Isn't she beautiful?

1161
01:19:15,953 --> 01:19:17,791
﻿He didn't recognize her, you know.

1162
01:19:18,244 --> 01:19:20,083
﻿-Really?
-I swear.

1163
01:19:22,792 --> 01:19:25,014
﻿What did you say when you found out
who she was?

1164
01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:32,305
﻿"One month here and you're gone.

1165
01:19:32,445 --> 01:19:33,659
﻿I don't even want to see you."

1166
01:19:34,458 --> 01:19:35,985
﻿I wouldn't be surprised!

1167
01:19:38,694 --> 01:19:42,026
﻿No, really, I'm very grateful
for you taking her in.

1168
01:19:42,618 --> 01:19:45,151
﻿She could hold any position
at my company,

1169
01:19:45,291 --> 01:19:47,096
﻿but she preferred to work with you.

1170
01:19:47,235 --> 01:19:48,346
﻿That's great.

1171
01:19:48,485 --> 01:19:51,018
﻿I know you'll take care of her
like your own daughter.

1172
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:52,512
﻿Of course.

1173
01:19:52,652 --> 01:19:55,289
﻿Knowing him, he'll be
on top of her all day.

1174
01:19:55,394 --> 01:19:58,101
﻿Not long ago she was a little girl.

1175
01:19:58,867 --> 01:20:01,851
﻿You had her on your knees,
you fed her a bottle.

1176
01:20:02,581 --> 01:20:04,455
﻿It seems like yesterday.

1177
01:20:05,185 --> 01:20:06,886
﻿Totally.

1178
01:20:12,859 --> 01:20:17,649
﻿FRIDAY

1179
01:20:18,761 --> 01:20:20,948
<i>﻿Open the wall.</i>

1180
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:23,690
<i>﻿Boom. boom, who is it?</i>

1181
01:20:23,830 --> 01:20:25,461
<i>﻿The dove and the olive branch.</i>

1182
01:20:25,566 --> 01:20:27,614
<i>﻿Open the wall.</i>

1183
01:20:28,587 --> 01:20:30,356
<i>﻿Boom. boom, who is it?</i>

1184
01:20:30,496 --> 01:20:32,093
<i>﻿The scorpion and the centipede.</i>

1185
01:20:32,198 --> 01:20:33,828
<i>﻿Close the wall...</i>

1186
01:20:34,732 --> 01:20:36,468
﻿This can't be, it can't be.

1187
01:20:38,794 --> 01:20:41,363
﻿He asked for permission
to use the company bathroom.

1188
01:20:44,072 --> 01:20:45,842
﻿What do I do, let him in?

1189
01:20:45,947 --> 01:20:47,404
<i>﻿Workers go on strike!</i>

1190
01:20:50,286 --> 01:20:51,675
﻿No, don't let him.

1191
01:20:51,988 --> 01:20:54,244
﻿He says his stomach hurts.

1192
01:20:54,384 --> 01:20:57,542
﻿Then he can go take a shit
at his wife's house.

1193
01:21:00,147 --> 01:21:01,987
﻿It will be worse,
he'll do it right there.

1194
01:21:02,126 --> 01:21:05,042
Román, do not let him use
the bathroom.

1195
01:21:08,029 --> 01:21:09,243
﻿What else.

1196
01:21:11,466 --> 01:21:14,833
﻿My ears hurt, from the bullhorn.

1197
01:21:14,938 --> 01:21:17,992
﻿I got otitis when I was little
and they're very sensitive.

1198
01:21:19,487 --> 01:21:21,533
﻿What do you want me to do?

1199
01:21:21,674 --> 01:21:23,444
﻿Take you to the doctor?

1200
01:21:24,034 --> 01:21:26,152
﻿You always say we should tell you
our problems.

1201
01:21:26,291 --> 01:21:28,061
﻿Not all of them, for God's sake.

1202
01:21:29,659 --> 01:21:33,408
<i>﻿Blanco, you're a rati
Let the people take a crap!</i>

1203
01:21:33,548 --> 01:21:34,797
<i>﻿Blanco!</i>

1204
01:21:42,158 --> 01:21:45,005
<i>﻿Assonant rhyme, right?</i>

1205
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:49,275
﻿Natalia, darling, how are you?

1206
01:21:49,415 --> 01:21:51,810
﻿Has the mayor got a second
for me?

1207
01:21:55,699 --> 01:21:58,163
﻿He's in a meeting,
he can't speak right now.

1208
01:21:58,269 --> 01:22:00,489
﻿It's important, a criminal matter.

1209
01:22:00,630 --> 01:22:03,337
﻿There's a homeless guy
camping across the street

1210
01:22:03,823 --> 01:22:06,184
﻿and that land is...

1211
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:11,947
﻿public, so he can't be there.
Imagine if there's an accident

1212
01:22:12,088 --> 01:22:16,774
﻿or if anything happens,
City Hall is publicly liable,

1213
01:22:16,913 --> 01:22:18,891
﻿-I checked.
<i>-I'll tell him.</i>

1214
01:22:19,031 --> 01:22:21,321
﻿The mayor wants to know
if you got the invitations

1215
01:22:21,462 --> 01:22:24,898
﻿for the ballet tonight.
He's expecting you and your wife

1216
01:22:25,038 --> 01:22:25,870
<i>﻿in his box.</i>

1217
01:22:25,975 --> 01:22:28,544
﻿I have the invitations,
thank you, but please,

1218
01:22:28,649 --> 01:22:32,189
﻿tell him what I just said, it's an
important matter for the community.

1219
01:22:32,329 --> 01:22:33,786
<i>﻿I'll tell him.</i>

1220
01:22:33,891 --> 01:22:36,286
﻿"Publicly liable," say it like that.

1221
01:22:36,391 --> 01:22:37,987
﻿With those same words.

1222
01:22:38,128 --> 01:22:38,751
<i>﻿I will.</i>

1223
01:22:38,857 --> 01:22:41,320
﻿Thank you, Natalia.
Thank you, goodbye.

1224
01:22:41,946 --> 01:22:43,126
﻿The committee.

1225
01:22:43,544 --> 01:22:45,209
﻿They were at Farmacol
this morning.

1226
01:22:45,835 --> 01:22:47,744
﻿We're the only ones left.

1227
01:23:03,611 --> 01:23:04,826
﻿Hold this.

1228
01:23:05,486 --> 01:23:06,771
﻿Please, take it.

1229
01:23:09,584 --> 01:23:10,971
﻿Fuck.

1230
01:23:18,055 --> 01:23:20,520
﻿What do you want to leave?
Tell me.

1231
01:23:21,284 --> 01:23:24,026
﻿-What do you want?
-I called you 20 times. 20.

1232
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:26,387
﻿You should have answered the phone,
it's too late now.

1233
01:23:26,527 --> 01:23:27,775
﻿How much do you want?

1234
01:23:29,235 --> 01:23:30,900
﻿Ask. How much?

1235
01:23:31,041 --> 01:23:32,845
﻿I don't want anything.

1236
01:23:32,984 --> 01:23:36,282
﻿Not your money or the job.
Nothing.

1237
01:23:36,387 --> 01:23:38,157
﻿You can stick it all up your ass.

1238
01:23:38,262 --> 01:23:40,483
﻿Don't make things worse, José.

1239
01:23:40,624 --> 01:23:44,615
﻿How can I make things worse?
Tell me.

1240
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:47,149
﻿I can't have my children with me.

1241
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:52,393
﻿I'm almost 50 years old,
who will hire me now?

1242
01:23:52,532 --> 01:23:55,135
﻿-How can I make things worse?
-You can't be here.

1243
01:23:55,275 --> 01:23:58,434
﻿Think about your kids, damn it!
They're being made fun of at school!

1244
01:23:58,573 --> 01:24:00,551
﻿Hold on. We'll fix this

1245
01:24:01,456 --> 01:24:03,434
﻿between you and me, all right?

1246
01:24:06,177 --> 01:24:07,912
﻿What job do you want?

1247
01:24:08,607 --> 01:24:10,725
﻿Yeah, think about it.

1248
01:24:11,489 --> 01:24:13,329
﻿Take your pick.

1249
01:24:13,434 --> 01:24:17,079
﻿You want his job? His?
Which one?

1250
01:24:17,184 --> 01:24:18,988
﻿I'll give it to you.

1251
01:24:23,364 --> 01:24:24,855
﻿You're the prodigal son.

1252
01:24:25,725 --> 01:24:28,050
﻿You know who the prodigal son is?

1253
01:24:28,746 --> 01:24:31,453
﻿You're the prodigal son, damn it!

1254
01:24:32,356 --> 01:24:33,258
﻿Yes!

1255
01:24:35,446 --> 01:24:36,591
﻿Yes, you are.

1256
01:24:46,105 --> 01:24:47,111
﻿You are.

1257
01:24:50,654 --> 01:24:51,937
﻿I won't move.

1258
01:24:55,271 --> 01:24:56,659
﻿I'm fine right here.

1259
01:24:58,466 --> 01:25:00,444
﻿I've never felt better.

1260
01:25:01,070 --> 01:25:03,742
﻿You can offer to let me sleep
in your bed with your wife.

1261
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:06,450
﻿I won't move.

1262
01:25:07,389 --> 01:25:09,054
﻿Over there, you're the boss.

1263
01:25:10,201 --> 01:25:11,485
﻿Not here.

1264
01:25:12,909 --> 01:25:13,984
﻿I won't move.

1265
01:25:16,902 --> 01:25:17,977
﻿I won't move.

1266
01:25:19,471 --> 01:25:22,213
﻿I won't move. I will not.

1267
01:25:22,353 --> 01:25:26,275
<i>﻿I will not move. I will not move.</i>

1268
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:28,150
<i>﻿I will not move.</i>

1269
01:25:28,255 --> 01:25:31,900
<i>We're here for real,
we will not make a deal.</i>

1270
01:25:32,005 --> 01:25:38,358
<i>We're here for real,
we will not make a deal!</i>

1271
01:25:38,463 --> 01:25:40,024
<i>﻿Blanco, go fuck yourself!</i>

1272
01:25:40,650 --> 01:25:42,142
<i>﻿Son of a bitch!</i>

1273
01:25:42,803 --> 01:25:44,052
﻿Bastard!

1274
01:25:44,574 --> 01:25:45,961
﻿Look, Blanco!

1275
01:25:46,101 --> 01:25:49,052
﻿That's right!
My ass has joined the fight!

1276
01:25:49,191 --> 01:25:50,475
﻿Look!

1277
01:25:51,101 --> 01:25:52,107
﻿Fucking wacko.

1278
01:25:52,212 --> 01:25:55,023
﻿-He's crazy, he won't listen to reason.
-Let's see...

1279
01:25:55,615 --> 01:26:06,099
<i>﻿The people united will never be defeated!</i>

1280
01:26:08,010 --> 01:26:09,884
﻿I thought they fixed it.

1281
01:26:20,682 --> 01:26:24,362
<i>﻿Eat shit!</i>

1282
01:26:24,467 --> 01:26:25,438
﻿Goddamn it.

1283
01:26:25,543 --> 01:26:27,347
<i>﻿Fuck you!</i>

1284
01:26:27,488 --> 01:26:28,459
﻿Son of a bitch!

1285
01:26:28,598 --> 01:26:31,549
<i>﻿Blanco, you're a rat!
Let the people take a crap!</i>

1286
01:26:31,689 --> 01:26:34,813
<i>﻿Blanco, you're a rat!
Let the people take a crap!</i>

1287
01:26:34,918 --> 01:26:37,417
<i>﻿That's right!</i>

1288
01:26:37,556 --> 01:26:43,632
<i>﻿You can eat shit, Blanco!</i>

1289
01:28:34,251 --> 01:28:36,923
﻿I need you to do me a favor.

1290
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:11,747
﻿Excuse me, I'll be right back.

1291
01:29:12,408 --> 01:29:15,185
﻿-Blanco.
-Not now, not now.

1292
01:29:15,602 --> 01:29:16,920
﻿I need to talk to you.

1293
01:29:18,415 --> 01:29:19,664
﻿Ask my secretary
for an appointment.

1294
01:29:19,803 --> 01:29:22,823
﻿You wanted me to treat you
like everyone else, right?

1295
01:29:30,878 --> 01:29:32,093
﻿Are you okay?

1296
01:29:34,872 --> 01:29:36,989
﻿JUSTICE USES BLANCO SCALES

1297
01:29:44,038 --> 01:29:46,537
﻿The layout here is simpler.

1298
01:29:46,676 --> 01:29:49,384
﻿More space for the product...

1299
01:29:49,523 --> 01:29:52,266
﻿I think the contrast between
the photograph

1300
01:29:52,371 --> 01:29:55,807
﻿and the illustration works.

1301
01:29:55,912 --> 01:29:59,765
﻿The concept is to highlight the idea
of justice with the committee coming.

1302
01:29:59,870 --> 01:30:01,848
﻿The company worries not only
about results...

1303
01:30:01,954 --> 01:30:03,758
﻿Can the robe be shorter?

1304
01:30:05,287 --> 01:30:08,792
We can try it, yes.
Justice is sexy.

1305
01:30:10,772 --> 01:30:13,757
﻿Yes, and we can prepare more ideas.

1306
01:30:13,897 --> 01:30:17,229
﻿We can work with the idea
of loyalty...

1307
01:30:17,334 --> 01:30:19,416
﻿Albert, you decide.

1308
01:30:19,557 --> 01:30:22,853
﻿As long as what we pay for
does the job.

1309
01:30:28,167 --> 01:30:29,832
﻿Get me Ignacio, please.

1310
01:30:31,674 --> 01:30:33,964
﻿How long is the new intern with us?

1311
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,888
﻿-Liliana?
-Yes.

1312
01:30:37,993 --> 01:30:39,936
﻿The contract is one month,

1313
01:30:40,076 --> 01:30:42,679
﻿-but we can renew it.
-When it's over, she leaves.

1314
01:30:42,853 --> 01:30:43,963
﻿I don't want her here.

1315
01:30:46,811 --> 01:30:48,268
﻿Ignacio.

1316
01:30:48,374 --> 01:30:50,143
﻿How are you?

1317
01:30:51,117 --> 01:30:53,720
﻿Listen, I have something for you.

1318
01:30:53,825 --> 01:30:56,324
﻿Hold... Hold on a second.

1319
01:30:56,464 --> 01:30:59,309
﻿I'm going to make you an offer
you can't refuse.

1320
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:02,053
﻿Yeah, like in the movies.

1321
01:31:02,922 --> 01:31:06,115
﻿I have the committee coming
to visit and...

1322
01:31:06,533 --> 01:31:12,677
﻿was thinking of putting in
a full page on Sunday...

1323
01:31:12,782 --> 01:31:14,760
<i>﻿Clean, dean.</i>

1324
01:31:15,699 --> 01:31:19,100
<i>﻿Nice and clean, nice and clean,</i>

1325
01:31:19,205 --> 01:31:21,287
<i>﻿cleaner than I've ever seen.</i>

1326
01:31:22,157 --> 01:31:23,302
﻿Fucking scale.

1327
01:31:23,407 --> 01:31:24,760
<i>﻿You're a scab. Román.</i>

1328
01:31:24,865 --> 01:31:26,010
<i>﻿An ass wipe.</i>

1329
01:31:27,990 --> 01:31:30,627
<i>﻿Don't look at me!
Join me, you turncoat!</i>

1330
01:31:30,767 --> 01:31:32,259
<i>﻿Don't look at me!</i>

1331
01:31:32,365 --> 01:31:33,890
<i>﻿Join me!</i>

1332
01:31:33,996 --> 01:31:35,419
<i>﻿Don't look at me!</i>

1333
01:31:37,086 --> 01:31:39,342
<i>﻿Blanco! Blanco!</i>

1334
01:31:39,864 --> 01:31:41,078
<i>﻿Thief!!</i>

1335
01:31:41,669 --> 01:31:43,335
<i>﻿Blanco the exploiter!</i>

1336
01:31:43,752 --> 01:31:46,946
<i>﻿Live with it, Blanco!
You're a thief!</i>

1337
01:31:47,085 --> 01:31:50,834
﻿You were right, Román.
I should have let him use the bathroom.

1338
01:31:55,349 --> 01:31:56,493
﻿Here.

1339
01:31:57,502 --> 01:31:59,237
﻿They have an inhibitor.

1340
01:32:00,835 --> 01:32:03,924
﻿You can thank Fortuna
when you see him.

1341
01:32:04,723 --> 01:32:06,493
﻿-Thanks, boss.
-You're welcome.

1342
01:32:08,925 --> 01:32:10,799
﻿Oh, Román, Román.

1343
01:32:11,251 --> 01:32:12,500
﻿Well...

1344
01:32:12,883 --> 01:32:15,450
﻿I've spoken too harshly
to you lately and...

1345
01:32:16,042 --> 01:32:17,638
﻿I have no right.

1346
01:32:19,445 --> 01:32:22,152
﻿I apologize.

1347
01:32:22,743 --> 01:32:24,235
﻿This hasn't been easy.

1348
01:32:24,375 --> 01:32:25,798
﻿What hasn't?

1349
01:32:25,903 --> 01:32:29,998
﻿These last few days,
with José across the street,

1350
01:32:30,138 --> 01:32:31,873
﻿with his kids...

1351
01:32:33,367 --> 01:32:35,657
﻿Having to fire people, damn it.

1352
01:32:36,249 --> 01:32:40,865
﻿And poor Miralles,
his wife has him in the dumps.

1353
01:32:42,985 --> 01:32:45,171
﻿The arguments...

1354
01:32:45,970 --> 01:32:50,969
﻿I have to do things I don't want to do
for the good of the company.

1355
01:32:52,255 --> 01:32:54,442
﻿It's like a surgeon...

1356
01:32:55,068 --> 01:32:56,317
﻿who doesn't want

1357
01:32:56,907 --> 01:32:58,504
﻿to amputate.

1358
01:32:59,442 --> 01:33:02,427
﻿Who wants to cut off someone's leg?

1359
01:33:03,192 --> 01:33:04,441
﻿The surgeon? No.

1360
01:33:04,997 --> 01:33:08,954
﻿I don't think the surgeon likes
cutting off someone's leg,

1361
01:33:09,094 --> 01:33:12,009
﻿but he has to do it.
Just like me.

1362
01:33:13,573 --> 01:33:14,717
﻿I have to do it.

1363
01:33:15,205 --> 01:33:16,419
﻿For all of you,

1364
01:33:18,052 --> 01:33:19,925
﻿for your families as well.

1365
01:33:21,663 --> 01:33:24,544
﻿Do I want to do it?
No, I don't.

1366
01:33:24,649 --> 01:33:25,828
﻿But I have no choice.

1367
01:33:25,968 --> 01:33:28,258
﻿-No what?
-Choice.

1368
01:33:41,071 --> 01:33:43,986
﻿Take this as compensation.
Here.

1369
01:33:45,064 --> 01:33:47,251
﻿"Romeo and Juliet" tonight.

1370
01:33:47,668 --> 01:33:49,334
﻿It's a ballet.

1371
01:33:50,029 --> 01:33:52,077
﻿-I've never been to a ballet.
-Exactly.

1372
01:33:52,216 --> 01:33:56,000
﻿It's about time, take your wife,
be nice to her,

1373
01:33:56,105 --> 01:33:58,465
﻿otherwise look what happens,
look at Miralles.

1374
01:33:58,987 --> 01:34:02,909
﻿Impossible, it's at 8.
I'll still be here at that hour.

1375
01:34:03,049 --> 01:34:05,270
﻿Leave early today, it's okay.

1376
01:34:07,632 --> 01:34:10,166
﻿I'm the boss, right? Then that's that.

1377
01:34:10,271 --> 01:34:13,464
﻿And don't tell anyone.

1378
01:34:17,458 --> 01:34:18,880
<i>﻿Blanco, look at me.</i>

1379
01:34:19,576 --> 01:34:21,866
<i>﻿Here I am, I'm not moving!</i>

1380
01:34:22,041 --> 01:34:22,942
﻿I will not move!

1381
01:34:23,604 --> 01:34:27,491
<i>﻿I'll be here waiting, Blanco!
I will not move!</i>

1382
01:34:43,949 --> 01:34:46,240
﻿Didn't the mayor invite us tonight?

1383
01:34:46,796 --> 01:34:47,976
﻿To the ballet.

1384
01:34:49,227 --> 01:34:51,274
﻿Yeah, maybe he forgot.

1385
01:34:54,990 --> 01:34:57,697
﻿LILIANA INTERN

1386
01:34:57,837 --> 01:34:59,121
﻿It was "Romeo and Juliet," wasn't it?

1387
01:34:59,643 --> 01:35:02,731
﻿Yes, tonight Romeo and Juliet

1388
01:35:03,253 --> 01:35:05,405
﻿will be you and me, my love.

1389
01:35:10,997 --> 01:35:13,147
﻿There are a lot of them today.

1390
01:35:15,961 --> 01:35:17,141
﻿It's Friday.

1391
01:35:26,377 --> 01:35:28,355
<i>﻿Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1392
01:35:28,495 --> 01:35:30,057

1393
01:35:30,196 --> 01:35:34,432
<i>﻿Please turn off your cell phones
and watch alarms.</i>

1394
01:35:39,813 --> 01:35:41,514
﻿It's starting.

1395
01:36:15,818 --> 01:36:16,859
﻿Thank you, Alina.

1396
01:36:26,685 --> 01:36:28,178
﻿What are you thinking about?

1397
01:36:33,109 --> 01:36:34,288
﻿Nothing.

1398
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:39,011
﻿I know what you think about
when you say nothing.

1399
01:36:51,580 --> 01:36:52,933
﻿Get out of here!

1400
01:36:54,948 --> 01:36:55,849
﻿Stop!

1401
01:36:55,990 --> 01:36:57,135
﻿Stop, please!

1402
01:36:57,691 --> 01:36:58,593
﻿Scum!

1403
01:37:00,990 --> 01:37:02,134
﻿Get the fuck out of here!

1404

﻿Pig!

1407

﻿I said get out of here!

1408
01:37:11,197 --> 01:37:12,202
﻿Asshole!

1409
01:37:43,139 --> 01:37:44,562
﻿At this hour?

01:37:49,180 --> 01:37:51,298
﻿Let it fucking burn!

1411

﻿Clown!

﻿Hey, you!

﻿Fortuna, what's wrong?

1416
01:38:36,365 --> 01:38:38,030
﻿Boss...

1417
01:38:39,559 --> 01:38:40,843
﻿What happened?

1418
01:38:43,101 --> 01:38:44,524
﻿What happened, Fortuna?

1419
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:53,967
﻿Hey...

1420
01:38:57,649 --> 01:38:59,140

﻿Come back if you've got balls!

1424
01:39:11,641 --> 01:39:12,924
﻿Come back here!

1425
01:39:13,307 --> 01:39:16,049
﻿Bastards!

1426
01:39:31,778 --> 01:39:36,568
﻿BLANCO SCALES WON'T FORGET YOU

1427
01:39:40,563 --> 01:39:43,513
﻿He was an extraordinary kid.

1428
01:39:44,417 --> 01:39:46,463
﻿Extraordinary, really.

1429
01:39:46,881 --> 01:39:49,207
﻿He helped me a lot in the shop.

1430
01:39:49,763 --> 01:39:53,894
﻿-He was a good kid.
-Yes, he was.

1431
01:39:55,943 --> 01:39:57,713
﻿I'm going to give your husband

1432
01:39:57,853 --> 01:40:01,706
﻿a bonus so you two
can take a trip together.

1433
01:40:01,846 --> 01:40:03,581
﻿And get some rest.

1434
01:40:03,721 --> 01:40:07,504
﻿Rubio already knows,
he'll handle everything.

1435
01:40:08,304 --> 01:40:09,969
﻿Don't worry about anything.

1436
01:40:12,957 --> 01:40:14,136
﻿Excuse me!

1437
01:40:15,387 --> 01:40:16,531
﻿Bring that over.

1438
01:40:16,949 --> 01:40:18,268
﻿Excuse me...

1439
01:40:19,761 --> 01:40:20,698
﻿Let's see..

1440
01:40:22,574 --> 01:40:24,205
﻿If you'll allow me...

1441
01:40:24,657 --> 01:40:27,017
﻿I'd like to say

1442
01:40:27,712 --> 01:40:29,864
﻿a few words on behalf of Fortuna
because

1443
01:40:30,003 --> 01:40:31,288
﻿he's not feeling strong enough.

1444
01:40:33,476 --> 01:40:34,585
﻿We've lost..

1445
01:40:35,281 --> 01:40:38,475
﻿We've lost a promising young man

1446
01:40:39,448 --> 01:40:43,370
﻿and no words can describe

1447
01:40:43,926 --> 01:40:45,280
﻿such an injustice.

1448
01:40:46,322 --> 01:40:48,126
﻿So as a tribute,

1449
01:40:48,961 --> 01:40:52,709
﻿with his parents' permission,
we're going

1450
01:40:53,405 --> 01:40:59,341
﻿to name the new generation of scales
we're developing after Salva

1451
01:41:00,175 --> 01:41:04,584
﻿so that his memory will stay alive

1452
01:41:04,724 --> 01:41:06,910
﻿anywhere you find a Blanco scale.

1453
01:41:09,446 --> 01:41:13,750
﻿Those of us here,
we all know each other.

1454
01:41:14,203 --> 01:41:16,389
﻿We're a big family

1455
01:41:16,494 --> 01:41:20,035
﻿and now we have to say goodbye
to those who move on...

1456
01:41:22,952 --> 01:41:23,993
﻿Let's go.

1457
01:41:28,819 --> 01:41:30,763
﻿My feet are frozen...

1458
01:41:30,868 --> 01:41:34,339
﻿Blanco, excuse me. Can we talk?

1459
01:41:34,444 --> 01:41:37,429
﻿Not here, Miralles.
Tomorrow at the factory.

1460
01:41:43,368 --> 01:41:48,054
﻿MONDAY

1461
01:42:50,620 --> 01:42:54,612
﻿Talk about bad luck.
The one day I leave early...

1462
01:43:05,029 --> 01:43:06,312
﻿Well...

1463
01:43:06,452 --> 01:43:09,437
﻿Have someone clean all that up, please.

1464
01:43:13,570 --> 01:43:16,277
﻿I want it clean when
the committee arrives.

1465
01:43:34,610 --> 01:43:35,998
﻿Give me a bullet.

1466
01:43:37,665 --> 01:43:39,365
﻿JUSTICE USES BLANCO SCALES

1467
01:43:39,818 --> 01:43:41,796
﻿The judge saw him this morning.

1468
01:43:42,491 --> 01:43:45,859
﻿They might set bail,
but he can't pay it anyway.

1469
01:43:48,324 --> 01:43:51,518
﻿-And the committee?
-They're coming tomorrow.

1470
01:44:00,546 --> 01:44:01,656
﻿Yes?

1471
01:44:03,948 --> 01:44:04,954
﻿Yes.

1472
01:44:06,067 --> 01:44:07,420
﻿Okay.

1473
01:44:10,997 --> 01:44:11,899
﻿Thank you.

1474
01:44:12,906 --> 01:44:14,120
﻿He's here.

1475
01:44:14,226 --> 01:44:15,613
﻿Okay, then.

1476
01:44:17,038 --> 01:44:18,982
﻿Have Inés come in.

1477
01:44:21,795 --> 01:44:24,432
﻿Inés, stop what you're doing
and come in the office.

1478
01:44:38,182 --> 01:44:39,814
﻿What's up? Good morning.

1479
01:44:42,036 --> 01:44:43,077
﻿Julito.

1480
01:44:43,182 --> 01:44:43,945
﻿What's up?

1481
01:44:46,724 --> 01:44:47,973
﻿Sara, how's it going?

1482
01:45:05,056 --> 01:45:07,520
﻿What is this?
What's going on here?

1483
01:45:07,694 --> 01:45:08,874
﻿What are my things doing there?

1484
01:45:09,396 --> 01:45:11,513
﻿Who told you to move in here?

1485
01:45:20,645 --> 01:45:23,317
﻿Why is that fucking Arab in my office?
Why isn't he loading trucks?

1486
01:45:23,458 --> 01:45:28,109
﻿Miralles, don't talk that way about
a coworker. You want some coffee?

1487
01:45:30,436 --> 01:45:34,185
﻿The gentleman has a name,
his name is Khaled and, well,

1488
01:45:34,325 --> 01:45:35,956
﻿he does it better than you.

1489
01:45:36,061 --> 01:45:38,073
﻿No, I'm the best.
I'll prove it to you anytime.

1490
01:45:38,179 --> 01:45:38,733
﻿Well.

1491
01:45:39,533 --> 01:45:40,643
﻿Let's see..

1492
01:45:40,783 --> 01:45:41,302
﻿Blanco...

1493
01:45:42,623 --> 01:45:45,955
﻿I'm better, much calmer,
give me a break.

1494
01:45:47,935 --> 01:45:51,094
﻿It's a delicate moment, Miralles,
and we need people

1495
01:45:51,268 --> 01:45:54,843
﻿at 100% and who will do anything

1496
01:45:55,018 --> 01:45:57,898
﻿for the company, like me right now.

1497
01:45:58,039 --> 01:46:01,093
﻿Or do you think I like doing this?
No.

1498
01:46:01,232 --> 01:46:02,690
﻿I have to cover my eyes.

1499
01:46:02,830 --> 01:46:05,884
﻿I have to set personal issues aside,

1500
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:11,196
﻿emotions as well, and choose
the best man for the job. Blindly.

1501
01:46:11,927 --> 01:46:16,196
﻿-I have no choice, Miralles.
-Julio, please.

1502
01:46:17,030 --> 01:46:20,987
﻿I have nothing. Aurora is leaving.
She's taking the kids with her.

1503
01:46:21,683 --> 01:46:26,091
﻿This is all I have left, my job.
Scales are my life.

1504
01:46:26,613 --> 01:46:27,896
﻿You're not going to help me?

1505
01:46:28,592 --> 01:46:30,570
﻿Miralles...

1506
01:46:31,717 --> 01:46:33,903
﻿-Miralles...
-You're not going to help me?

1507
01:46:34,008 --> 01:46:37,687
﻿Miralles, look, take it easy.

1508
01:46:39,286 --> 01:46:40,604
﻿You help me.

1509
01:46:41,716 --> 01:46:42,723
﻿Help me.

1510
01:46:43,349 --> 01:46:45,639
﻿Remember that time we were

1511
01:46:46,021 --> 01:46:49,527
﻿in the car together,
when we were 10 years old?

1512
01:46:49,633 --> 01:46:51,228
﻿You helped me so much.

1513
01:46:51,369 --> 01:46:52,756
﻿It wasn't me.

1514
01:46:52,896 --> 01:46:53,451
﻿What?

1515
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:56,436
﻿I didn't take the blame.
You're the one

1516
01:46:56,577 --> 01:46:58,867
﻿who put the rifle in my hand
and told my father

1517
01:46:58,973 --> 01:46:59,978
﻿that it was me.

1518
01:47:00,952 --> 01:47:04,561
﻿-That's not how I remember it.
-And I'll tell you something else.

1519
01:47:05,361 --> 01:47:07,651
﻿Our fathers never went
hunting together,

1520
01:47:08,381 --> 01:47:11,575
﻿my dad loaded your dad's rifle,
which is very different.

1521
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:13,172
﻿He loaded his rifle.

1522
01:47:13,693 --> 01:47:16,018
﻿Okay, okay, okay.

1523
01:47:17,131 --> 01:47:20,984
﻿I won't make it easy for you.
I'll go to the labor department.

1524
01:47:21,089 --> 01:47:25,220
﻿I'm not José, I know a lot

1525
01:47:25,359 --> 01:47:28,761
﻿about how this company works
and I've saved paperwork.

1526
01:47:31,991 --> 01:47:33,136
﻿Just like Inés.

1527
01:47:33,866 --> 01:47:35,358
﻿What a coincidence.

1528
01:47:35,463 --> 01:47:37,615
﻿She saved your messages too.

1529
01:47:39,317 --> 01:47:40,357
﻿Yes.

1530
01:47:40,532 --> 01:47:43,586
﻿But she's not going to report you.

1531
01:47:45,949 --> 01:47:47,232
﻿What are you talking about?

1532
01:47:48,136 --> 01:47:51,641
﻿She told me about
that little issue you two had.

1533
01:47:58,969 --> 01:48:03,307
﻿That wasn't very nice, Miralles.

1534
01:48:04,628 --> 01:48:08,723
﻿Taking advantage of your position
in the company to abuse the secretary.

1535
01:48:08,864 --> 01:48:09,557
﻿Damn!

1536
01:48:09,697 --> 01:48:11,675
﻿No, it wasn't like that.
I didn't abuse anyone.

1537
01:48:11,815 --> 01:48:13,584
﻿That's not what I understand.

1538
01:48:14,731 --> 01:48:17,300
﻿But I convinced her not to report you,

1539
01:48:17,856 --> 01:48:19,522
﻿a favor I'm doing for you.

1540
01:48:21,189 --> 01:48:22,542
﻿In exchange,

1541
01:48:23,897 --> 01:48:26,987
﻿you take the severance pay
Rubio gives you, whatever it is,

1542
01:48:27,613 --> 01:48:28,792
﻿and you leave.

1543
01:48:29,488 --> 01:48:32,750
﻿I never want to see you again.

1544
01:48:34,938 --> 01:48:37,299
﻿I remember what my father
used to say:

1545
01:48:38,029 --> 01:48:39,138
﻿Sometimes you have

1546
01:48:39,938 --> 01:48:43,062
﻿to trick the scale
to get the exact weight.

1547
01:48:55,528 --> 01:48:57,193
﻿Inés, come in.

1548
01:49:16,047 --> 01:49:18,476
﻿Great news, I already heard.

1549
01:49:18,964 --> 01:49:21,671
﻿I'm opening a Chateau Laffite
to celebrate.

1550
01:49:22,505 --> 01:49:23,788
﻿What news?

1551
01:49:48,649 --> 01:49:50,175
﻿What are we celebrating?

1552
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:55,106
﻿You hiring Liliana, she told me.

1553
01:49:56,704 --> 01:49:59,099
﻿I talked to her mother
and she went crazy.

1554
01:50:00,454 --> 01:50:03,786
﻿She wanted to send you flowers,
I said absolutely not.

1555
01:50:04,620 --> 01:50:06,147
﻿And a boss.

1556
01:50:08,057 --> 01:50:11,841
﻿-A boss?
-Head of Marketing, can you imagine?

1557
01:50:12,362 --> 01:50:14,272
﻿How do you think Albert will take it?

1558
01:50:14,377 --> 01:50:15,556
﻿Who is Albert?

1559
01:50:16,841 --> 01:50:18,056
﻿Her assistant.

1560
01:50:21,598 --> 01:50:23,264
﻿Your advertisement was beautiful.

1561
01:50:23,647 --> 01:50:25,313
﻿And the concept of justice,

1562
01:50:25,418 --> 01:50:29,027
﻿that it's not just making good scales,
we're talking about a company

1563
01:50:29,132 --> 01:50:32,152
﻿that is fair, that worries about
its employees.

1564
01:50:32,257 --> 01:50:33,645
﻿That's great for the award.

1565
01:50:34,861 --> 01:50:36,145
﻿That was the idea.

1566
01:50:36,250 --> 01:50:39,130
﻿told her to move in with us here,
the upstairs bedroom.

1567
01:50:39,271 --> 01:50:40,832
﻿Better than that apartment.

1568
01:50:40,972 --> 01:50:42,291
﻿She said it sounds perfect.

1569
01:50:43,506 --> 01:50:44,547
﻿Perfect.

1570
01:50:45,555 --> 01:50:47,811
﻿She can keep us company
in this big house.

1571
01:50:50,208 --> 01:50:53,609
﻿Alina was preparing it,
I'll see how she's doing.

1572
01:50:55,138 --> 01:50:56,665
﻿I'll get you a glass.

1573
01:51:07,637 --> 01:51:10,691
﻿Do I even need to say
how much you're paying me?

1574
01:51:22,081 --> 01:51:25,065
﻿WELCOME TO BLANCO SCALES

1575
01:52:47,006 --> 01:52:50,060
﻿Liliana Urbina, our brand new
Head of Marketing.

1576
01:52:50,165 --> 01:52:54,434
﻿Young and energetic, and most of all,
a female point of view,

1577
01:52:54,540 --> 01:52:56,553
﻿essential to any company.

1578
01:52:56,658 --> 01:52:58,809
﻿Okay. This way.

1579
01:53:04,435 --> 01:53:08,670
﻿Khaled Ga... I won't even try
