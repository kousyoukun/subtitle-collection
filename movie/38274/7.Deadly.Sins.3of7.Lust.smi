<SYNC Start=15208>Ah, lust. What is it about<br>these physical pleasures? So
<SYNC Start=18583>licentious, so lascivious, that<br>they've led so many to ruin.
<SYNC Start=25541>[Music]
<SYNC Start=31416>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=33500>After all, wasn't it lust in her<br>eyes that lead Eve to take a
<SYNC Start=36458>bite out of that Apple. Or the<br>Greeks to war with Troy. Yes,
<SYNC Start=40333>even the strongest, the bravest,<br>the most brutal can be undone by
<SYNC Start=43375>lust. For centuries, kings,<br>queens, Popes and presidents
<SYNC Start=51083>have all given in to their most<br>primal instincts. Caligula had
<SYNC Start=54416>his orgies, Cardinals had their<br>concubines and even highborn
<SYNC Start=59916>rulers like Catherine the<br>Great's sexual appetites were
<SYNC Start=62500>so enormous, legend has it she<br>could ultimately only be
<SYNC Start=66083>satisfied by a horse. Yes,<br>they say lust knows no mercy but
<SYNC Start=72083>for one man it<br>also knows no age.
<SYNC Start=76000>[Music]
<SYNC Start=81250>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=84916>>> Childhood was great. There<br>was nothing really out of the
<SYNC Start=87958>ordinary. Great family.
<SYNC Start=93250>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=94416>Over the years I've<br>dated various looks
<SYNC Start=96583>here and there. Some men they<br>like blondes. Some men like
<SYNC Start=102250>brunettes. Some men like fat<br>women. Some men like men. I knew
<SYNC Start=110083>like early on that girls my age<br>aren't really my thing.
<SYNC Start=114916>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=122083>I want to say that I was<br>in 6th grade and there was a
<SYNC Start=124333>teacher who would always<br>sit in front of the class
<SYNC Start=126916>and she would sit on the
<SYNC Start=128083>stool wearing skirts and she<br>would cross her legs back and
<SYNC Start=130750>forth. She was hot, I knew<br>instantly. She was probably 68,
<SYNC Start=134375>69 years old. I remember the<br>first thing I ever searched on
<SYNC Start=140833>the Internet, ever. I mean, I<br>knew early on. One of the
<SYNC Start=147791>questions I've been asked, o.k.,<br>Kyle, let's say I put a Sports
<SYNC Start=151875>Illustrated swimsuit model in<br>front of you next to an older
<SYNC Start=154875>woman, which one are you going<br>to go for? I would look at the
<SYNC Start=157083>Sports Illustrated girl and I<br>would think, okay, looking at
<SYNC Start=159375>her, she was pretty. I bet her<br>grandma is gorgeous. Everyone
<SYNC Start=164333>is wired. You don't have a<br>choice. You like what you like
<SYNC Start=167750>because your brain is hardwired<br>that way. Aging is a part of
<SYNC Start=173958>life and it is natural<br>and I like that look. I like
<SYNC Start=178625>wrinkles. I like the neck line.<br>I like gray hair. Yeah, I like
<SYNC Start=186625>boobs. A little, even a hell of<br>a lot of saggage, it's fine, I
<SYNC Start=191041>mean it's normal. It's going to<br>happen. To me, dentures are
<SYNC Start=194583>like the unicorn of oral sex.<br>It's something that you look
<SYNC Start=197583>for. It's like trying to find<br>that four leaf clover. That's
<SYNC Start=200291>the one, it's awesome. So, here<br>I am in high school. You know, I
<SYNC Start=205333>was trying to get a date with<br>an older woman. They weren't
<SYNC Start=208541>having it. They were like you<br>are so young. No one told me
<SYNC Start=212625>how to do it. I had to go out<br>there with trial and error.
<SYNC Start=216000>But I got better at it. I mean,<br>I realized you know, how to talk
<SYNC Start=220416>to a woman. It doesn't hurt to<br>know who Tony Bennett is.
<SYNC Start=225500>I found that places like grocery<br>stores is a good place to go up
<SYNC Start=229541>and complement someone and say,<br>hi. You know what, take a
<SYNC Start=233416>chance. Just take a chance. Have<br>one date and see what happens.
<SYNC Start=239375>>> I met Kyle on a dating site.<br>I told him you should find
<SYNC Start=243791>someone your own age. And I<br>told him this a couple of times.
<SYNC Start=247958>I think it was the 3rd time<br>he said, well just have dinner
<SYNC Start=250791>with me. So, I agreed to have<br>dinner with him. And we met for
<SYNC Start=254083>dinner and I instantly liked<br>him. I was very nervous because
<SYNC Start=260916>I knew I hadn't had sex for a<br>while. So we were undressed and
<SYNC Start=267625>I even got more afraid because<br>I thought, I don't think that's
<SYNC Start=270541>going to fit. So. But he<br>made me feel very comfortable.
<SYNC Start=278583>Never once did he seem awkward<br>to be with me. We would be out
<SYNC Start=282791>in public and he would hold my<br>hand and kissed me. That feels
<SYNC Start=288000>just great that someone his age<br>could like someone my age.
<SYNC Start=295083>>> Me and Anna, our sex life<br>it's awesome. Sometimes, like
<SYNC Start=299250>she'll just grab me by my<br>throat which is really cool
<SYNC Start=302208>because she looks so<br>innocent and so unassuming.
<SYNC Start=309000>>> I think if you stop having<br>sex because of your age or
<SYNC Start=312916>you've lost your spouse or<br>whatever, I think that you're
<SYNC Start=316708>really missing out<br>on a part of life.
<SYNC Start=320041>>> No one wakes up one day and<br>goes, well you know what guys,
<SYNC Start=322875>today I'm 73 and it's time to<br>stop having sex and it's time to
<SYNC Start=326083>start being boring and shit.<br>No one ever does that.
<SYNC Start=331500>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=338083>>> I live in a senior complex.<br>The average woman there, all
<SYNC Start=343666>they want is their time alone.<br>They are not interested in sex
<SYNC Start=348500>or men, period.
<SYNC Start=351541>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=357916>I got into doing gang<br>bangs in 2008. I've done 14
<SYNC Start=364083>since and each one is<br>better than the last one.
<SYNC Start=369083>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=372375>Yeah, it's like if you taste a
<SYNC Start=374375>new ice cream and you like it,
<SYNC Start=375666>you don't just have it once.
<SYNC Start=377208>[Laughter]
<SYNC Start=378916>>> Shirley is a lot<br>like me in the sense of,
<SYNC Start=381666>neither one of us are<br>looking for that relationship.
<SYNC Start=386083>>> The first time Kyle and I<br>had sex, we just enjoyed each
<SYNC Start=388750>other's bodies. He's a<br>wonderful lover, he's a giver.
<SYNC Start=397000>>> We have hard, rough sex.<br>There is hair pull and there's
<SYNC Start=400208>body and there's scratching.
<SYNC Start=404458>>> Do you want specifics?
<SYNC Start=405583>>> [Off-screen] Oh, yeah.
<SYNC Start=409958>>> Some people out there might<br>not even know what squirting is
<SYNC Start=414250>but Kyle can make me squirt<br>over and over and over.
<SYNC Start=419166>>> I don't hold back, I don't<br>go easy. I mean, older women can
<SYNC Start=422208>take it. They can have<br>sex just like anyone else can.
<SYNC Start=429750>>> I don't think Kyle was easy<br>on me as far as sex because I am
<SYNC Start=433250>older than he is.
<SYNC Start=435750>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=437458>I am 91 years old.<br>I would date a man my own
<SYNC Start=442458>age, but there aren't any.<br>Of the people who graduated with
<SYNC Start=448125>me, there are only 2 of us<br>living. I think sex was a big
<SYNC Start=453416>part of life. It must have been,<br>I have 6 kids. When Kyle first
<SYNC Start=460166>came over, he brought a dozen<br>rubbers and 3 boxes of Astro
<SYNC Start=465208>glide. I said, what do you think<br>you're going to do with that
<SYNC Start=469500>Astro glide, I make my<br>own lubrication. Right.
<SYNC Start=474583>[Laughter]
<SYNC Start=477333>>> And then he grabbed me and<br>kissed me. It was earth
<SYNC Start=480041>shattering, believe me. I have<br>not been kissed like that for a
<SYNC Start=484666>long time.
<SYNC Start=486750>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=489416>Do I still have orgasms?<br>Yes, I do.
<SYNC Start=493208>Shouldn't I?
<SYNC Start=496166>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=500458>>> I do enjoy, I guess capturing<br>the moment. I tried to take
<SYNC Start=504250>pictures of the women that I<br>date and I like to shoot videos
<SYNC Start=508416>as well. And those videos, they<br>stay on my hard drive. They are
<SYNC Start=513125>just for me to have. Older<br>women, they are just like other
<SYNC Start=518666>women. You know, all women enjoy<br>attention and affection. They
<SYNC Start=522666>like being told they're pretty<br>or attractive. They like to feel
<SYNC Start=525458>desired. The only<br>difference is they are older.
<SYNC Start=530458>>> I am just sorry that I didn't<br>start it sooner. A lot of the
<SYNC Start=533458>years of my life, I could<br>have had a lot more fun
<SYNC Start=536416>and enjoyed myself.
<SYNC Start=538166>>> Yeah, if you only knew<br>you would be happy, too.
<SYNC Start=544333>>> I mean, I think at my age you<br>get to the point where you don't
<SYNC Start=548250>give a hoot what people think.
<SYNC Start=550916>>> They haven't kept you living.<br>I've kept myself. Does that
<SYNC Start=556375>sound wrong? Does that sound<br>selfish or anything? I don't
<SYNC Start=561916>know. I just lived so long. You<br>can't imagine. Anybody who's
<SYNC Start=566916>younger can't imagine what it's<br>like. It's just like, probably
<SYNC Start=571625>maybe what people do when<br>they do dope. It gives you
<SYNC Start=574125>a big shot. It's the best.
<SYNC Start=579583>>> Who are you to put<br>limitations or to put asterisks
<SYNC Start=582625>next to your mom or your grand<br>mom's happiness. If you
<SYNC Start=586625>can't be happy that they are<br>happy then you are a bad person.
<SYNC Start=589416>Period.
<SYNC Start=591791>[Music]
<SYNC Start=596958>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=603625>>> Lust, how it makes us do<br>so many, many wicked things.
<SYNC Start=610083>What if the true answer to<br>controlling our most unbridled
<SYNC Start=612166>passions is just<br>giving into them.
<SYNC Start=616583>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=633416>>> I probably became an<br>ordained minister because it
<SYNC Start=635500>was my mother's intention that I<br>enter the ministry. I attended
<SYNC Start=642458>divinity school starting<br>in the fall of 1952.
<SYNC Start=647625>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=651500>I was a respected lobbyist in<br>the wedding chapel game.
<SYNC Start=656541>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=658916>I said that I would<br>represent brothels.
<SYNC Start=663250>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=665541>Women are not the<br>same creature once they
<SYNC Start=668875>are married and settled down as<br>when they were on the prowl and
<SYNC Start=672583>they were looking for a husband.<br>Once they get the little
<SYNC Start=677750>cottage or the white picket<br>fence, the 2-year-old twins and
<SYNC Start=681625>the puppies to take care of, the<br>gentleman and his sexual needs
<SYNC Start=685250>kind of pushed to the back<br>burner. And I think the man who
<SYNC Start=690166>discreetly goes to a brothel<br>can save a marriage.
<SYNC Start=696083>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=699666>Brothels, they are<br>saving marriages.
<SYNC Start=702750>[Music]
<SYNC Start=707791>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=713958>>> George, hi, George.
<SYNC Start=715625>>> Baby, hi how are you. Kylie,<br>come sit down here.
<SYNC Start=718875>>> Hi, how are you.
<SYNC Start=720041>>> It's good to see you my lady.
<SYNC Start=721333>>> It's good to see you too.<br>This is Alexis.
<SYNC Start=722500>>> Hello, Alexis. My pleasure.
<SYNC Start=724208>>> Nice to meet you.
<SYNC Start=725791>>>Come in Christie. I always get<br>quizzed because I am a minister,
<SYNC Start=732625>and my position is this.<br>In biblical history,
<SYNC Start=736750>Jesus' best friend was Mary<br>Magdalene. She was a
<SYNC Start=740583>prostitute. So Jesus is<br>confronted in the streets of
<SYNC Start=745083>Jerusalem by this group of men<br>who are ready to stone this lady
<SYNC Start=748625>and they said that she was<br>caught in sin, she was nothing
<SYNC Start=752000>but a simple, plain, prostitute.<br>And he looked down at her, and
<SYNC Start=755916>he said, let him and who is<br>without sin cast the 1st stone.
<SYNC Start=760166>And everybody put their stones<br>on the ground and walked off.
<SYNC Start=762750>And then Jesus said to Mary, now<br>Mary go thy way and sin no more.
<SYNC Start=768041>What did he really mean by that?<br>Did he mean, don't continue
<SYNC Start=770875>your profession? Or did he mean,<br>don't take it to heart that it's
<SYNC Start=773916>wrong. The Bible does not tell<br>us that she quit being or that
<SYNC Start=778083>she stopped being a prostitute.
<SYNC Start=781500>[Music]
<SYNC Start=785916>>> The type of women that work<br>in brothels are a unique amalgam
<SYNC Start=791958>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=795750>>> When a client<br>walks in the door,
<SYNC Start=797583>the hostess calls the lineup.
<SYNC Start=801416>She will say, the ladies are<br>going to introduce themselves.
<SYNC Start=804416>>> Hi, I'm Barbie.
<SYNC Start=805708>>> Hi, I'm Hollywood.
<SYNC Start=807083>>> Hi, I am Melissa Kiss.
<SYNC Start=808625>>> Hi, I am a Eva Grace.
<SYNC Start=809958>>> Hi, I am Christie Kiss.
<SYNC Start=810916>>> Hi, I am Carmen Sage.
<SYNC Start=812250>>> I am Alyssa Fox.
<SYNC Start=816916>>> When the men enter and<br>they see all of us lined up,
<SYNC Start=820750>they seem nervous.
<SYNC Start=823583>>> Because, I just don't like<br>picking someone out of a crowd.
<SYNC Start=827833>>> I feel guilty, because<br>I don't want to pick any
<SYNC Start=830125>one person out and<br>make the others feel bad.
<SYNC Start=835666>>> Then, she will ask him to<br>select a girl of his choice.
<SYNC Start=838958>>> As a woman, it can be very,<br>very nerve-racking, as well.
<SYNC Start=842416>Just because, you know,<br>you want to get picked.
<SYNC Start=847041>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=857291>>> You know what, there<br>are some kids that come in,
<SYNC Start=859458>very young kids.
<SYNC Start=860750>And we're just like, oh no<br>the babies are in and we
<SYNC Start=863333>generally get picked by the<br>younger, the younger guys.
<SYNC Start=867250>They are just gaga, with the<br>big guys. Oh my gosh,
<SYNC Start=869958>I just want a cougar so bad.
<SYNC Start=872791>[Laughter]
<SYNC Start=877083>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=881208>>> Were going to need 1300 cash.
<SYNC Start=882708>Okay.
<SYNC Start=884083>[Sexy Music]
<SYNC Start=891791>>> If men weren't very<br>sexually inclined,
<SYNC Start=894458>pretty soon we<br>would all die off.
<SYNC Start=900083>>> I'll do pretty much what ever<br>they like to do. At like an
<SYNC Start=904791>anal party or something<br>like that, I don't like
<SYNC Start=908750>the real quickies.
<SYNC Start=912916>>> He wanted me to pretend like<br>I was cooking a lobster in this
<SYNC Start=916125>bathtub in this sauna and<br>calling my friends on the phone
<SYNC Start=920125>and inviting them<br>to this big dinner.
<SYNC Start=923583>>> Golden showers, Roman<br>showers, and brown showers.
<SYNC Start=927791>I get a lot of<br>golden shower requests.
<SYNC Start=934000>>> There is a lot of guys<br>who come in with a fetish.
<SYNC Start=937500>Maybe their wife doesn't feel<br>comfortable doing, or maybe they
<SYNC Start=939916>don't even feel<br>comfortable talking about.
<SYNC Start=946666>>> You may have that fear, I<br>have to see this person every
<SYNC Start=949750>day and they are going to<br>know that I like butt plugs.
<SYNC Start=953625>[Laughter]
<SYNC Start=956916>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=964458>>> Where is the average man<br>supposed to go for a sexual
<SYNC Start=968166>release if he weighs 375 pounds?<br>Where is the average man
<SYNC Start=974500>supposed to go for a sexual<br>accommodation if he has lost
<SYNC Start=978500>both arms in the Vietnam War?
<SYNC Start=983416>>> If somebody is willing to be<br>open with me, I am willing to
<SYNC Start=985416>work with them. If they're shy,<br>or they don't know how to go
<SYNC Start=989416>down on their wife. Or, you<br>know, they just need to get this
<SYNC Start=993083>tension and frustration out.<br>They just need a release.
<SYNC Start=995125>>> The longer you're married,<br>the less oral sex seems to be a
<SYNC Start=1001958>paramount thing for a wife.<br>Men need blow jobs
<SYNC Start=1008625>to put it bluntly.
<SYNC Start=1012083>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1017541>>> I would tell you this, if I<br>was going to get remarried, I
<SYNC Start=1021666>would've probably married and an<br>ex-working girl. Because they
<SYNC Start=1024416>are smart in so many ways<br>as far as taking care of
<SYNC Start=1029083>and pleasing a man.
<SYNC Start=1033416>>> Why have you made<br>this your cause?
<SYNC Start=1035541>>> I believe in it. It minimizes<br>so many of the negatives
<SYNC Start=1038791>that exist everywhere else.<br>Some people golf,
<SYNC Start=1045375>I protect this industry.
<SYNC Start=1047666>[Music]
<SYNC Start=1052416>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1055666>>> Many men do not come to a<br>brothel for the select purpose
<SYNC Start=1059958>of having sexual intercourse.<br>Many of these men come for the
<SYNC Start=1066625>company and the touch. There is<br>nothing more important to a man
<SYNC Start=1073875>then the touch of a female.
<SYNC Start=1079208>>> It could be going out to a<br>restaurant or something like
<SYNC Start=1081166>that. Or it could just be<br>cuddling in bed and sharing
<SYNC Start=1084250>secrets and talking<br>about feelings.
<SYNC Start=1088541>>> A lot of times men just come<br>in here and just want to talk.
<SYNC Start=1095125>>> A lot of these men actually<br>really love their wives.
<SYNC Start=1098500>They still have an emotional<br>connection with them but the

<SYNC Start=1105250>>> Their wives had surgeries,<br>older women hysterectomies,
<SYNC Start=1109833>cancer, chemotherapy and they<br>just can't have sex. For the
<SYNC Start=1116083>most part the married men, they<br>love their wives. They would
<SYNC Start=1118791>never think of doing anything<br>like this outside of here.
<SYNC Start=1123291>They come here because,<br>because they're safe and
<SYNC Start=1126750>it's not cheating.

<SYNC Start=1179500>>> Come on in.
<SYNC Start=1181750>>> Why should I feel guilty?
<SYNC Start=1187083>>> He was very naughty boy<br>and then he went home and was

<SYNC Start=1242083>a love in the faith in all<br>things and through all
<SYNC Start=1244708>situations will carefully<br>and devotedly always try.
<SYNC Start=1250083>Always think of<br>the other person first.
<SYNC Start=1257666>We see every day, regardless<br>of your professional choice;
<SYNC Start=1265000>minister, politician, architect.<br>The chances are that you are
<SYNC Start=1270416>going to have your own times<br>where your morals are tested
<SYNC Start=1273875>and tried. It's very<br>shortsighted for anybody to
<SYNC Start=1282000>condemn a minister who does<br>certain things that may not be
<SYNC Start=1287125>typically traditional in<br>society. And I think I can say
<SYNC Start=1294250>even as Jesus did, let him that<br>is without sin cast the first
<SYNC Start=1300041>stone. If Jesus were around<br>today, he'd probably say George,
<SYNC Start=1307000>just keep up the good work.
<SYNC Start=1311291>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1328250>>> How we do live in a world of<br>such endless possibilities.
<SYNC Start=1332958>Just take a look at the folks<br>over at Exotic Erotics. They are
<SYNC Start=1336750>currently putting a different<br>spin on the beast with 2 backs
<SYNC Start=1343458>[Music]
<SYNC Start=1351291>>> I feel that horses are the<br>most beautiful animals. Oh, the
<SYNC Start=1357125>way they move, the way their<br>muscles work. I'm not sure
<SYNC Start=1362500>exactly where my fascination<br>with a horses came from.
<SYNC Start=1368291>I don't know,<br>I can relate to them.
<SYNC Start=1372750>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1377875>I am the owner of Exotic<br>Erotics. We are the only
<SYNC Start=1381083>company that makes<br>adult sex toys that are
<SYNC Start=1382916>cast from live animal genitalia.
<SYNC Start=1385583>[Music]
<SYNC Start=1392500>>> Life casting is the process<br>of making a copy of a living
<SYNC Start=1394916>object. Our specialty is making<br>life casts of animal genitalia
<SYNC Start=1399166>to be turned into adult toys.
<SYNC Start=1404333>I live in a very rural area.<br>Horses play a really big role.
<SYNC Start=1409750>Honestly, I have no idea what<br>most people would do if they
<SYNC Start=1413333>knew what I did for a living.
<SYNC Start=1417416>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1421083>Well, first before we start
<SYNC Start=1422291>casting, we have to make sure<br>all our materials are set up so
<SYNC Start=1425250>that we are ready to go on a<br>moments notice because the whole
<SYNC Start=1428458>casting process takes less than<br>10 minutes. We have to have a
<SYNC Start=1433333>stallion. Someone brings in a<br>mare that is in heat and she
<SYNC Start=1439375>teases the stallion<br>into arousal.
<SYNC Start=1441583>[Horse Neigh]
<SYNC Start=1442750>>> Once he gets aroused, we<br>start the process of mixing up
<SYNC Start=1445291>the materials and then we would<br>pour the materials into the
<SYNC Start=1448333>casting tube. And then we would<br>slide that tube over his
<SYNC Start=1451625>erection and hold it there for<br>5 minutes until it is set.
<SYNC Start=1461333>We back the teaser mare off. He<br>loses his erection, and then we
<SYNC Start=1464666>have our first negative cast.
<SYNC Start=1467666>[Music]
<SYNC Start=1471458>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1477541>>> We make a mold out of that.<br>And then once that's done we can
<SYNC Start=1480583>pour our toys into that mold. We<br>have custom colors, we can
<SYNC Start=1485500>pretty much pour our toys into<br>almost any color that you can
<SYNC Start=1488291>think of. Currently, we<br>have life casts of humans,
<SYNC Start=1493083>dogs and horses.
<SYNC Start=1496750>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1500083>We have casted a Great<br>Pyrenees, a St. Bernard and an
<SYNC Start=1504083>Australian Shepherd. I would<br>love to cast some smaller breeds
<SYNC Start=1508750>who appeal to more female<br>customers. They are a huge part
<SYNC Start=1511791>of this industry. We make<br>sculpted models that are based
<SYNC Start=1516916>off animal genitalia that we<br>cannot life cast because it's
<SYNC Start=1520541>just not a possibility.<br>We have an elephant trunk,
<SYNC Start=1526083>a giraffe tongue, deer, rhinos,<br>hippocampus, dinosaurs, orca
<SYNC Start=1533291>whales. Well, you probably could<br>cast an orca whale, but you know
<SYNC Start=1537666>getting the availability. No<br>matter what's out there, there
<SYNC Start=1545083>is someone who has had sexual<br>attraction to it. We 3-D print
<SYNC Start=1552958>all of these models. I have a<br>3-D artist that lives in the
<SYNC Start=1556583>Czech republic and he does<br>amazing work with turning ideas
<SYNC Start=1560708>into actual objects.
<SYNC Start=1563333>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1565583>Our price ranges<br>anywhere from $35-$300.
<SYNC Start=1571250>The first year we sold about 500<br>units. This last year we sold
<SYNC Start=1575125>over 2000. Our largest model is<br>Jackson, which is 22 inches in
<SYNC Start=1581291>length and 3 1/2 inches in<br>girth. Uh, we have a few
<SYNC Start=1589125>negative reviews but, mostly we<br>find that the customer just
<SYNC Start=1593166>ordered a toy that is too large<br>for them and they kind of count
<SYNC Start=1596583>it as a negative because they<br>can't use it because it's too
<SYNC Start=1598916>large. It just takes years<br>usually to train your body to be
<SYNC Start=1606750>able to, you know, take such<br>large objects. You are actually
<SYNC Start=1610750>modifying your body in a way.<br>Your sigmoid colon, that's a
<SYNC Start=1614916>curve in your intestines, and<br>people who get really extreme
<SYNC Start=1619750>into this stuff will actually<br>straighten that out to make it
<SYNC Start=1623125>so that they are able to acquire<br>larger objects into them.
<SYNC Start=1626708>And then you have the people who<br>actually really get turned on by
<SYNC Start=1629125>the fact that they are<br>cast off actual horses.
<SYNC Start=1633791>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1638291>>> A lot of people can be into<br>bestiality. They are physically
<SYNC Start=1643791>attracted to the animals.
<SYNC Start=1646833>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1648625>People who just<br>like large objects,
<SYNC Start=1653750>certain physical features,<br>just connecting with an animal
<SYNC Start=1659083>that size. Being with them<br>and interacting with them.
<SYNC Start=1665833>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1667833>I mean, you get<br>attached to an animal.
<SYNC Start=1672083>Our toys are a lot safer<br>for everyone involved.
<SYNC Start=1675250>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1677208>It's a great outlet for<br>their customer instead of
<SYNC Start=1681375>partaking in bestiality. I have<br>been called an artist by quite a
<SYNC Start=1688875>few people even though I don't<br>quite feel like one.
<SYNC Start=1692750>I am just representing what<br>mother nature has already made.
<SYNC Start=1698666>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1707875>>> Lust, a sin that has truly so<br>many faces. Really, why should
<SYNC Start=1713458>we suppress such indelible urges<br>that are so elemental. I mean,
<SYNC Start=1717250>after all, who is ultimately the<br>most satisfied in this world.
<SYNC Start=1721416>The ones who bite the apple or<br>the ones who just stare at it?
<SYNC Start=1726666>Until Next time. You're a<br>good dog, aren't you.
