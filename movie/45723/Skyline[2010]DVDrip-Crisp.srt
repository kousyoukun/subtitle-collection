1
00:01:29,888 --> 00:01:32,243
Oh, is it morning already?

2
00:01:49,766 --> 00:01:51,756
[vomits]

3
00:02:14,324 --> 00:02:17,076
[rumbling]

4
00:02:17,243 --> 00:02:18,802
Jarrod.

5
00:02:21,803 --> 00:02:23,475
Jarrod, wake up.

6
00:02:25,283 --> 00:02:27,274
It's OK.

7
00:02:38,162 --> 00:02:40,232
What is that?

8
00:02:40,402 --> 00:02:41,916
I don't know.

9
00:02:45,482 --> 00:02:47,473
[woman] Hey!

10
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:52,993
Stay here.

11
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:56,635
- What's wrong?
- He's gone!

12
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:13,314
[woman] Jarrod! Jarrod!

13
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:20,634
Jarrod!

14
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:24,471
Jarrod!

15
00:03:48,117 --> 00:03:50,073
[air hostess] We'll be
starting beverage service.

16
00:03:50,236 --> 00:03:52,592
For a complete list of choices,

17
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:55,669
please see the last page
of your in-flight magazine.

18
00:03:56,596 --> 00:03:59,063
I can't decide.

19
00:03:59,236 --> 00:04:01,227
Elaine, you pick the last one.

20
00:04:11,435 --> 00:04:13,504
J- Rock?
T-Money?

21
00:04:13,674 --> 00:04:16,634
Oh, no, we were... we
were ahead of our time.

22
00:04:16,795 --> 00:04:18,592
We're bad.

23
00:04:18,755 --> 00:04:22,383
- You haven't changed a bit.
- Neither's Terry.

24
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:27,029
You'll see. He's the real deal.

25
00:04:27,193 --> 00:04:28,866
Can't wait.

26
00:04:54,591 --> 00:04:58,710
Well, you should have thought about
that before you shot the piece of shit.

27
00:04:59,631 --> 00:05:02,702
- What are you doing here so early?
- [woman] It's a beautiful day.

28
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,701
Don't I know it.

29
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,668
Ray called again about
the robot sequence.

30
00:05:06,831 --> 00:05:09,822
Tell him to handle it. No
business on my birthday.

31
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,859
- Hey.
- God, does she always have to be here?

32
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:18,860
She's working. Show biz, baby.

33
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,385
Mm. You're all sweaty.

34
00:05:43,908 --> 00:05:45,864
Hey. You feelin' all right?

35
00:05:46,027 --> 00:05:48,825
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
- OK.

36
00:05:54,548 --> 00:05:57,107
Here. Let me get that
for you. There you go.

37
00:05:57,267 --> 00:05:59,655
- Thank you.
- No problem.

38
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,498
That's my fine hero.

39
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,463
Let's go.

40
00:06:13,185 --> 00:06:15,097
Yeah, that's us.

41
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,100
[Jarrod] Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

42
00:06:21,265 --> 00:06:24,813
- You better not get used to this.
- Who, me?

43
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,532
[woman] Penthouse.

44
00:07:03,181 --> 00:07:05,615
- All right. Come on.
- Going down.

45
00:07:06,901 --> 00:07:09,050
How's the second most
talented guy I know?

46
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,688
- I don't know. How are you?
- I'm good.

47
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,493
Happy birthday!

48
00:07:15,661 --> 00:07:18,174
- Oh, my God!
- You must be Elaine. Welcome.

49
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,699
This is amazing.

50
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,168
Automatic living at its finest.

51
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:26,569
My own personal place in the clouds.

52
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,777
[Elaine] The view is incredible.

53
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,453
Let me ask you a question.
You keeping my boy in line?

54
00:07:33,618 --> 00:07:35,609
Don't answer that.

55
00:07:35,778 --> 00:07:38,168
- Hey. - It's
a full-time job.

56
00:07:38,338 --> 00:07:41,250
Well, whatever he's
paying you, I'll double it.

57
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,774
Well, it looks like you've
got your hands full already.

58
00:07:44,938 --> 00:07:48,053
I like her, yeah. That's
your room right there.

59
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:51,892
- You guys wanna hit the pool?
- Absolutely.

60
00:07:52,058 --> 00:07:55,207
Baby! Pool time!

61
00:08:02,977 --> 00:08:05,206
- Baby, get me a cosmo.
- Absolutely. Hold this.

62
00:08:05,376 --> 00:08:07,173
Hey, bar's this way.

63
00:08:11,176 --> 00:08:12,688
- You really did it, man.
- Yeah.

64
00:08:12,855 --> 00:08:14,652
Just like everybody
knew you would, but...

65
00:08:14,816 --> 00:08:17,409
- Hey, guys.
- Hello.

66
00:08:17,575 --> 00:08:19,690
Couldn't have done it without you.

67
00:08:19,855 --> 00:08:22,892
- What'd I do, decorate the walls?
- They do look nice.

68
00:08:23,055 --> 00:08:24,727
- They do look
nice. - Mm-hm.

69
00:08:24,895 --> 00:08:27,011
Happy birthday, Terry.

70
00:08:27,175 --> 00:08:29,972
Yeah. Happy birthday to me.

71
00:08:32,575 --> 00:08:34,805
I can't thank you enough for this, man.

72
00:08:34,975 --> 00:08:37,647
I'm the one who should
be getting you a gift.

73
00:08:37,814 --> 00:08:40,452
I got some ideas on that. Come on.

74
00:08:43,532 --> 00:08:46,047
I see everyone's getting along famously.

75
00:08:47,813 --> 00:08:49,486
- Baby.
- Yeah.

76
00:08:49,653 --> 00:08:51,370
Where's my cosmo?

77
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,523
Oh, my bad.

78
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:55,648
Denise, get me a drink.

79
00:08:55,812 --> 00:08:57,292
- Anyone else?
- No.

80
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:04,602
Hey, this definitely
beats Brooklyn in December.

81
00:09:04,772 --> 00:09:08,764
- I kind of like having four seasons.
- We got one of those down the block.

82
00:09:08,932 --> 00:09:11,570
Tomorrow we gonna hit the high seas.

83
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:13,881
I'm gonna take y'all
out on my Sunseeker.

84
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:18,729
67 footer. My starter yacht.

85
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:25,839
Homeland Security.

86
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:29,126
They must be here because they know
tonight's party's gonna be a bomb!

87
00:09:29,289 --> 00:09:31,087
Baby... Oh!

88
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:35,800
[all] Cheers!

89
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:38,763
[woman] Happy birthday, Terry.

90
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:40,280
- Hey, man.
- Nice job, man.

91
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:42,440
- How's it going, man?
- Happy birthday, Terry.

92
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,884
There's somebody I
want you to meet. Ray!

93
00:09:48,048 --> 00:09:50,242
Hold on.

94
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:52,968
What's up, man? Happy birthday, man.

95
00:09:53,128 --> 00:09:56,005
Thank you. How's the
robot fight coming along?

96
00:09:56,167 --> 00:10:00,922
Dude, it sucks. But the director
loves it, so, you know...

97
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,077
- Hey, is this the boy wonder?
- [Terry] Yeah.

98
00:10:03,246 --> 00:10:06,716
And his lovely lady, yeah. Right.

99
00:10:06,886 --> 00:10:09,320
- Hey, it's good to meet you, man.
- Good to meet you too.

100
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:11,920
I'm psyched you're
gonna join the crew.

101
00:10:12,087 --> 00:10:14,965
- Huh?
- Did you find a place to live yet?

102
00:10:15,127 --> 00:10:17,356
I'm telling you,
Venice is where it's at.

103
00:10:17,526 --> 00:10:20,562
- We'll keep that in mind. Thank you.
- I live there, so I'll show you around.

104
00:10:20,725 --> 00:10:23,797
I have to go use the little
girls' room. Excuse me.

105
00:10:23,965 --> 00:10:25,478
No... Babe...

106
00:10:25,645 --> 00:10:28,364
- Elaine!
- Bro, she's smokin'.

107
00:10:28,524 --> 00:10:30,322
- Nice job, dude.
- Excellent.

108
00:10:30,485 --> 00:10:32,840
- Way to go.
- What's he talking about?

109
00:10:33,004 --> 00:10:34,518
What's going on, ladies?

110
00:10:35,363 --> 00:10:37,878
- I'm sorry.
- What was that about? Jeez...

111
00:10:38,044 --> 00:10:41,754
OK, look, cat's
obviously out of the bag.

112
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:46,797
I've been thinking...
You should move to LA.

113
00:10:48,003 --> 00:10:52,235
What am I gonna do out here?
I'm barely surviving back home.

114
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:55,474
- I could use you.
- I don't need any charity, all right?

115
00:10:55,643 --> 00:10:59,033
OK, fine. I need you.

116
00:10:59,202 --> 00:11:00,955
I don't know anything
about effects, man.

117
00:11:01,122 --> 00:11:03,591
- That's bullshit. Come on, man.
- That's not bullshit.

118
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:07,720
You got the eye and you know
it. The computer is just a tool.

119
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:13,154
I just... I don't know, OK?
I never saw myself out here.

120
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:18,319
Where do you see yourself? You got
a five-year plan I don't know about?

121
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:20,756
Look, it's not about the money, OK?

122
00:11:20,921 --> 00:11:23,036
It's always about the money.

123
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,589
What about Elaine?

124
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:33,549
I can't handle everything. You
gotta take care of that yourself.

125
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:36,154
[Denise] Terry, there's
a call for you upstairs.

126
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,311
You think about it.

127
00:11:53,757 --> 00:11:55,748
Elaine.

128
00:12:01,197 --> 00:12:05,713
Come on. We're supposed to be
having fun. What's the problem?

129
00:12:05,877 --> 00:12:07,947
Just forget it, all right?

130
00:12:09,557 --> 00:12:13,390
Look, Terry sprung this whole
California thing on me today, all right?

131
00:12:13,556 --> 00:12:16,515
- I had no idea. I didn't come out...
- I'm late.

132
00:12:17,317 --> 00:12:19,033
What do you mean, late?

133
00:12:19,195 --> 00:12:21,505
Late.

134
00:12:23,717 --> 00:12:26,309
Oh. Sorry.

135
00:12:32,515 --> 00:12:34,471
- Since when?
- I don't know.

136
00:12:35,594 --> 00:12:39,109
I've been feeling sick all
week, so I took a test and...

137
00:12:40,194 --> 00:12:41,991
Why didn't you tell me?

138
00:12:42,153 --> 00:12:44,587
I wanted to.

139
00:12:44,753 --> 00:12:47,666
Believe me, I just... I
didn't wanna ruin your trip.

140
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,824
You didn't...

141
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:55,101
Shit.

142
00:12:55,273 --> 00:12:57,151
Is that all you have to say?

143
00:12:57,314 --> 00:12:59,701
What do you want me to say?

144
00:13:01,712 --> 00:13:04,545
- I don't think I'm ready for this.
- You're not ready, Jarrod?

145
00:13:04,712 --> 00:13:07,351
- What about me?
- It's not...

146
00:13:07,512 --> 00:13:10,025
Hey, will you get...

147
00:13:18,351 --> 00:13:21,548
Is that what we have to look forward to?

148
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,261
Lainey...

149
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,980
[Ray] Right! Ready!

150
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,664
Here we go, here we go! I think
we've got a live one! Whoo!

151
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,138
We have a wiener!

152
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,667
That's what I'm talking about! Whoo!

153
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:49,740
Oh, yeah! Go!

154
00:13:49,908 --> 00:13:52,548
Go! Go! Go! Go!

155
00:13:54,628 --> 00:13:56,743
Oh, my God! No!

156
00:13:58,307 --> 00:13:59,536
- God, no!
- No!

157
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,062
No!

158
00:14:01,228 --> 00:14:03,217
- Oh, my God!

159
00:14:11,146 --> 00:14:14,776
Pardon me, ma'am, but we've
received a few noise complaints.

160
00:14:14,946 --> 00:14:16,824
From who?

161
00:14:16,987 --> 00:14:19,260
- The building's half empty.
- I understand that.

162
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:22,622
But the other half is trying to
sleep. So if you don't mind, just...

163
00:14:22,786 --> 00:14:24,219
- Fine.
- OK.

164
00:14:38,425 --> 00:14:41,416
- Another one for the books.
- Oh, yeah.

165
00:14:43,345 --> 00:14:45,938
Well, well, well.

166
00:14:46,105 --> 00:14:48,493
- Mm-mm. I call the
couch. - Oh, come on.

167
00:14:48,664 --> 00:14:51,019
- There's plenty of room for both of us.
- I like my space.

168
00:14:51,184 --> 00:14:53,458
Whoa. All right.

169
00:14:53,623 --> 00:14:55,615
Beggars can't be choosers.

170
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,573
- Good night.

171
00:16:26,015 --> 00:16:28,006
Earthquake?

172
00:16:28,176 --> 00:16:30,008
Probably just a tremor.

173
00:16:50,854 --> 00:16:53,084
What the...?

174
00:17:11,892 --> 00:17:13,645
Turn off the lights.

175
00:17:24,651 --> 00:17:26,448
Ray.

176
00:17:27,251 --> 00:17:29,241
What are you doing?

177
00:17:33,371 --> 00:17:34,485
Ray.

178
00:17:34,651 --> 00:17:36,641
What is that?

179
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:48,599
Ray!

180
00:17:53,808 --> 00:17:56,118
Stay here.

181
00:17:58,089 --> 00:18:00,080
- What's wrong?
- He's gone!

182
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:11,525
Jarrod, no.

183
00:18:12,168 --> 00:18:14,443
Jarrod, no!

184
00:18:14,607 --> 00:18:17,405
- Jarrod. Jarrod. No!
- [Terry] What the hell's going on?

185
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:20,035
Terry, please! Terry, help!

186
00:18:22,886 --> 00:18:25,241
What's with you, man?

187
00:18:26,046 --> 00:18:28,401
Jarrod.

188
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,636
Oh, my God. Jarrod, Jarrod.

189
00:18:30,806 --> 00:18:33,957
- Jarrod!
- Please. What's happening?

190
00:18:35,485 --> 00:18:39,115
- Jarrod?
- [Elaine] Jarrod. Oh, God. Oh, my God.

191
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:42,401
Jarrod. What is that?

192
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:46,397
What's wrong with him?

193
00:18:47,605 --> 00:18:49,596
Jarrod. Oh, my God.

194
00:18:50,604 --> 00:18:53,199
- Where's Ray? Where's Ray?
- Terry, no.

195
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,877
- No, no.
- Jarrod?

196
00:18:55,044 --> 00:18:56,362
- Where is he?
- He's gone.

197
00:18:56,523 --> 00:18:58,037
- What do you mean?
- He's gone!

198
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:00,957
- Did he fall? Did he jump?
- No! I don't know, I don't know.

199
00:19:01,124 --> 00:19:05,035
[Elaine] Please. Please. Please.

200
00:19:05,203 --> 00:19:07,718
He went outside, to the light.

201
00:19:09,283 --> 00:19:11,876
And then he... he just disappeared.

202
00:19:15,202 --> 00:19:16,840
- Baby.

203
00:19:17,922 --> 00:19:19,800
Terry, please.

204
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,470
Jarrod, look at me. What did
you see, huh? What did you see?

205
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,395
Careful.

206
00:19:57,479 --> 00:19:59,470
Jarrod, what happened?

207
00:20:01,758 --> 00:20:03,510
I don't know.

208
00:20:07,677 --> 00:20:09,317
I was being pulled...

209
00:20:10,518 --> 00:20:13,157
...towards this light.

210
00:20:21,797 --> 00:20:23,832
Hey, open the blinds.

211
00:20:23,996 --> 00:20:25,828
- No.
- Open the blinds!

212
00:20:25,997 --> 00:20:27,908
- No!
- God!

213
00:20:39,474 --> 00:20:42,752
- There's something down there.
- What?

214
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,394
Jarrod, check this out.

215
00:20:57,074 --> 00:20:59,269
I don't see anything.

216
00:21:00,434 --> 00:21:04,790
- There are people on the roof.
- [Elaine] What are they doing?

217
00:21:04,953 --> 00:21:07,422
I don't know.

218
00:21:08,713 --> 00:21:12,592
- We should check it out.
- You don't know what's out there.

219
00:21:16,272 --> 00:21:18,263
- Yeah, OK.
- All right.

220
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:20,423
I'm calling the police.

221
00:21:23,392 --> 00:21:26,509
- I'll try and get some pictures.
- You can't go out there.

222
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,429
I can't let him go out there alone.

223
00:21:29,591 --> 00:21:31,468
It just keeps ringing.

224
00:21:37,071 --> 00:21:39,301
A gun? Really?

225
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:42,349
Just check the news and find
out what the hell is going on.

226
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:44,786
- Terry...
- We'll be right back.

227
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,541
- Jarrod.
- Look at me.

228
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,778
Let's go.

229
00:21:58,949 --> 00:22:00,745
Hurry back.

230
00:22:28,427 --> 00:22:30,419
Stairs are this way.

231
00:22:53,904 --> 00:22:56,703
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

232
00:22:56,865 --> 00:22:59,299
- Dammit, Walt.
- What's going on?

233
00:22:59,465 --> 00:23:02,900
- We're going to check it out.
- What are you doing with a gun?

234
00:23:03,064 --> 00:23:05,623
Get back in your apartment. Go.

235
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:08,298
And keep it down.

236
00:23:14,623 --> 00:23:16,614
Hey...

237
00:23:17,823 --> 00:23:19,176
You sure about this?

238
00:23:29,342 --> 00:23:31,810
There's been nothing new since 4 am.

239
00:23:33,942 --> 00:23:35,933
Denise, check the TV.

240
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,011
It's calm.

241
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:12,257
Dammit, Jarrod.

242
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:16,330
- You didn't tell me to hold it open.
- I thought it was common sense.

243
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:19,967
I'm sorry.

244
00:24:20,138 --> 00:24:22,652
- Get down.

245
00:24:27,498 --> 00:24:29,488
What now?

246
00:24:30,617 --> 00:24:32,733
Let's get a better look.

247
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:41,929
Hi, this is Jackie.
Please leave a message.

248
00:24:42,096 --> 00:24:46,806
- Mom, it's me. Something's happened...

249
00:24:49,015 --> 00:24:51,769
Pick up. Please just...

250
00:24:53,696 --> 00:24:55,731
Call me back as soon as you get this.

251
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:55,524
Holy shit.

252
00:26:24,847 --> 00:26:28,238
I can't see it. Is
that what I think it is?

253
00:26:33,127 --> 00:26:34,923
Oh, my God.

254
00:27:09,084 --> 00:27:11,722
- Just run.
- What is it?

255
00:27:11,883 --> 00:27:12,954
- Run!
- Go!

256
00:27:18,723 --> 00:27:21,396
Come on, pull! Back up! Back up!

257
00:27:24,364 --> 00:27:26,958
Come on! Come on!

258
00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:32,158
- Come on! Come on!

259
00:27:36,963 --> 00:27:39,430
Come on!

260
00:27:41,842 --> 00:27:43,832
[Jarrod] Elaine, no!

261
00:27:55,961 --> 00:27:58,394
Move. Move!

262
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,799
Come on. It's OK.

263
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,520
Baby, are you OK?

264
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,956
I feel like I'm on fire.

265
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,759
Come on, baby. I'm here.

266
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:16,037
Give me the... Give it to me.

267
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:22,509
It'll pass in a few minutes. Look at me.

268
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:27,510
Look at me.

269
00:28:46,917 --> 00:28:48,907
You looked too.

270
00:28:51,877 --> 00:28:53,866
How?

271
00:29:10,955 --> 00:29:13,150
Oh, my God.

272
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,705
All those people.

273
00:29:24,274 --> 00:29:28,425
- What do they want with them?
- I'm not looking to find out.

274
00:29:28,593 --> 00:29:32,631
[woman] God, I can't
believe this. I mean, how?

275
00:29:32,792 --> 00:29:34,908
[Jarrod] Once you look at the light...

276
00:29:38,153 --> 00:29:41,303
...it grabs hold and it's like...

277
00:29:41,472 --> 00:29:43,463
It controls you.

278
00:29:44,352 --> 00:29:47,582
I mean, who wouldn't wanna
look at something so beautiful?

279
00:29:49,231 --> 00:29:50,983
It's kind of brilliant, actually.

280
00:29:52,032 --> 00:29:55,740
Enough of this shit. I got an idea.

281
00:29:55,912 --> 00:29:57,707
- Where are you going?
- Walt.

282
00:29:57,871 --> 00:29:59,508
- [Jarrod] What for?
- I worry about him.

283
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:02,344
- [Denise] Terry...
- Everything's under control.

284
00:30:31,388 --> 00:30:33,698
Are you OK?

285
00:30:33,868 --> 00:30:35,904
- Yeah, it's nothing.
- Let me see.

286
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:38,058
I said it's nothing.

287
00:30:40,508 --> 00:30:42,498
All right.

288
00:31:07,345 --> 00:31:09,142
[whispers] Walt.

289
00:31:22,024 --> 00:31:24,015
Yo, Walt.

290
00:31:25,544 --> 00:31:27,535
Walt.

291
00:31:30,585 --> 00:31:32,575
Walt.

292
00:31:33,703 --> 00:31:35,694
Are you in here?

293
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,699
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hiding.

294
00:31:59,862 --> 00:32:05,378
I saw the people in the
sky like a goddamn rapture.

295
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:09,329
Come on. We're taking your car and we're
getting the hell out of here. Let's go.

296
00:32:09,501 --> 00:32:11,570
- I'm not going out there.

297
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:15,130
- Get down. Get down.

298
00:32:19,899 --> 00:32:22,288
- Shh!
- Shut the dog up. Shut the dog up.

299
00:33:00,216 --> 00:33:02,251
Shh!

300
00:33:35,933 --> 00:33:38,401
- No!
- No! No! Walt!

301
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:09,402
Did you hear that?

302
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:14,202
What's up? Talk to me.

303
00:34:15,531 --> 00:34:17,009
We're getting on my boat
and getting out of here.

304
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:19,125
- What happened?
- They took Walt.

305
00:34:19,289 --> 00:34:20,928
They got Walt? What
are you talking about?

306
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:24,798
This one was different. It came in
the building and it just snatched him.

307
00:34:25,891 --> 00:34:29,086
- Then we should just go.
- Hold on a sec.

308
00:34:29,249 --> 00:34:31,763
Am I the only one who saw those photos?

309
00:34:31,928 --> 00:34:35,045
That's all happening right outside,
right now. They're everywhere.

310
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:38,758
No, they're not everywhere.
They're not over the water.

311
00:34:38,928 --> 00:34:39,918
That's right.

312
00:34:40,088 --> 00:34:44,127
Yeah, well, it didn't take 'em
very long to find you on the roof.

313
00:34:44,288 --> 00:34:45,960
We can drive there in two minutes.

314
00:34:46,127 --> 00:34:48,322
You have no idea what
they're capable of.

315
00:34:48,488 --> 00:34:51,445
Elaine, I know you're
scared, OK? We're all scared.

316
00:34:51,607 --> 00:34:54,166
But I'm not burying my head in
the sand and hoping this goes away.

317
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:56,396
- I'm not saying that.
- Just take it easy, man.

318
00:34:56,567 --> 00:34:58,716
- There's nothing easy about this!
- I understand...

319
00:34:58,886 --> 00:35:01,605
They're in the fucking building!

320
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:04,884
- Terry...
- It's the timer.

321
00:35:05,046 --> 00:35:07,037
[Denise] Oh, my God.

322
00:35:13,365 --> 00:35:15,879
Shit.

323
00:35:18,005 --> 00:35:20,394
[Terry] All right. Go, go, go! Move!

324
00:35:34,963 --> 00:35:36,443
Shh.

325
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:32,149
- You're disgusting.
- What the hell's the matter with you?

326
00:36:38,918 --> 00:36:42,594
- We'll talk about that later.
- Yeah, we will talk about that.

327
00:36:51,438 --> 00:36:55,635
- Still wanna stay?
- I don't want any of this.

328
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:58,230
But it didn't see us or hear us.

329
00:36:58,396 --> 00:37:01,230
- So if we stay here and stay quiet...
- [Terry] For how long?

330
00:37:01,397 --> 00:37:04,149
They're taking people out
there, plain and simple.

331
00:37:04,317 --> 00:37:07,149
The further we get out of the
city, the better off we are.

332
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:10,708
- He's right.
- Jarrod.

333
00:37:10,876 --> 00:37:12,389
If we get to the boat, we have a chance.

334
00:37:12,556 --> 00:37:14,592
- Yeah, but we don't...
- We have to...

335
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:20,474
We have to try.

336
00:37:20,636 --> 00:37:25,790
Get your stuff. Pack food
and water. Let's do this.

337
00:37:40,074 --> 00:37:42,430
[Terry] Let's go.

338
00:38:03,871 --> 00:38:05,225
All right, come on.

339
00:38:05,392 --> 00:38:08,589
Look, the sooner I get there,
the sooner the boat's ready to go.

340
00:38:08,752 --> 00:38:10,184
Right here.

341
00:38:10,351 --> 00:38:11,784
- Hey.
- Come on, let's go.

342
00:38:11,951 --> 00:38:13,350
- What...
- What are you doing?

343
00:38:13,511 --> 00:38:16,742
Driving. I know the way.
Why don't you take your slut?

344
00:38:16,912 --> 00:38:18,865
Candice.

345
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,258
Candice.

346
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,549
Get in the car.

347
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,305
Terry, I'm sorry.

348
00:39:09,827 --> 00:39:12,294
- Hurry up.
- What do you think I'm doing?

349
00:39:17,186 --> 00:39:18,505
- Hey, slow down.
- No.

350
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:20,621
Just stop.

351
00:39:21,505 --> 00:39:23,938
- You need any help?
- No, just go. We're fine.

352
00:39:24,104 --> 00:39:28,383
- Yeah, but maybe he can help us.
- Enough, all right? I said we're fine.

353
00:39:47,783 --> 00:39:49,774
Terry!

354
00:39:59,743 --> 00:40:00,969
Terry, get up!

355
00:40:07,342 --> 00:40:10,094
- Terry! Terry!
- My God! Terry!

356
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,971
I got you!

357
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,897
Jarrod, get your ass back in here now!

358
00:40:30,581 --> 00:40:32,491
Drive! Drive now!

359
00:40:38,819 --> 00:40:41,696
- [man] What are you doing?
- [woman] Get in the car.

360
00:40:48,139 --> 00:40:50,174
[Jarrod] Come on! Come on!

361
00:40:56,937 --> 00:40:59,656
Open! Oh, shit!

362
00:40:59,817 --> 00:41:02,412
- [Elaine] Come on!
- Open! God!

363
00:41:02,578 --> 00:41:04,169
Come on.

364
00:41:07,137 --> 00:41:09,127
[Candice] Open, you piece of shit!

365
00:41:12,297 --> 00:41:15,572
Back up! Back up! Back up! Go!

366
00:41:37,534 --> 00:41:39,843
[screams] Oh, my God!

367
00:41:40,014 --> 00:41:42,575
Help me! Help me!

368
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:47,801
- Help me!
- [Elaine] This way!

369
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:53,566
Candice, where's the key?
Candice, the key! Turn the key!

370
00:42:15,532 --> 00:42:17,523
[woman] Oh, my God.

371
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:28,525
- You all right?
- I'm OK.

372
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:31,568
- Hm.
- Oh, my God.

373
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,927
- Oh, my God!
- Miss, we have to go.

374
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:36,408
No, he...

375
00:42:37,731 --> 00:42:39,448
He's alive!

376
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:40,758
God!

377
00:42:42,929 --> 00:42:44,443
Help me!

378
00:43:02,209 --> 00:43:05,005
Come on, let's go!

379
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:06,203
Oh, my God!

380
00:43:11,247 --> 00:43:13,715
Go! Go!

381
00:43:29,726 --> 00:43:31,717
Make for the back door.

382
00:43:41,325 --> 00:43:42,679
Run!

383
00:44:13,002 --> 00:44:15,119
Move!

384
00:44:21,682 --> 00:44:23,671
Go!

385
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,714
Don't stop!

386
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:42,511
Open the door!

387
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:50,672
- Get it open!
- Back up.

388
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,716
Open it!

389
00:44:55,558 --> 00:44:57,389
Come on!

390
00:45:02,878 --> 00:45:05,597
- Where are we going?
- All the way to the top.

391
00:45:05,758 --> 00:45:08,273
- The safest place I could think of.
- We were just up there.

392
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:14,305
You wanna stay down here with
that, be my guest. Go on. Let's go.

393
00:45:18,717 --> 00:45:21,150
Come on, quickly, quickly, quickly.

394
00:46:07,753 --> 00:46:09,072
[Elaine] Jarrod...

395
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:11,224
I should have held onto him.

396
00:46:19,032 --> 00:46:21,991
Hey. Come help me with this.

397
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:41,981
It's better than nothing, right?

398
00:46:42,871 --> 00:46:44,861
Yeah, if you say so.

399
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:50,139
What are you doing, huh? Like
it or not, this is happening.

400
00:46:52,989 --> 00:46:54,980
You gotta be strong.

401
00:47:03,068 --> 00:47:04,945
Is everybody OK?

402
00:47:07,309 --> 00:47:08,503
Are you hurt?

403
00:47:09,628 --> 00:47:12,267
- No.
- I'm OK.

404
00:47:21,667 --> 00:47:25,182
- What now?
- We stay here. We keep watch.

405
00:47:25,347 --> 00:47:28,463
- And we pray that someone comes.
- He's right.

406
00:47:29,266 --> 00:47:32,656
Someone's gonna come.
This can't go on forever.

407
00:47:34,307 --> 00:47:35,897
Right?

408
00:47:43,705 --> 00:47:45,899
- Elaine...
- It's best if we stay together.

409
00:47:46,066 --> 00:47:48,454
I can't. The smoke.

410
00:47:49,705 --> 00:47:52,696
Given the circumstances, I think
a smoke is more than reasonable.

411
00:47:52,864 --> 00:47:54,856
Candice...

412
00:47:57,105 --> 00:47:59,334
I'm pregnant, all right?

413
00:48:00,304 --> 00:48:02,771
And I just thought that...

414
00:48:02,943 --> 00:48:04,935
...between all the stress...

415
00:48:10,504 --> 00:48:12,494
It's OK.

416
00:48:16,142 --> 00:48:18,373
I never even got to tell my mom.

417
00:48:30,061 --> 00:48:32,529
Come on, boss. Let's let
the girls get some sleep.

418
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:34,692
You and I will keep watch.

419
00:48:36,461 --> 00:48:37,894
Both of us?

420
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:42,179
They try that light stuff,
we got each other's back.

421
00:49:03,778 --> 00:49:05,770
I hate LA.

422
00:49:33,776 --> 00:49:36,291
I haven't seen a soul all night.

423
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,489
Maybe the worst is over.

424
00:49:41,655 --> 00:49:43,850
Maybe not.

425
00:49:46,296 --> 00:49:49,253
What do you think
those things really are?

426
00:49:49,414 --> 00:49:51,485
I don't know.

427
00:49:51,654 --> 00:49:53,645
Does it even matter?

428
00:49:58,574 --> 00:50:00,007
It just doesn't seems real.

429
00:50:03,774 --> 00:50:05,923
Well, it is real.

430
00:50:06,094 --> 00:50:08,085
You better wake up.

431
00:50:10,454 --> 00:50:14,286
- What's that supposed to mean?
- The city's a vacant lot.

432
00:50:14,452 --> 00:50:16,443
We need to survive.

433
00:50:18,852 --> 00:50:21,207
There's not gonna be many of us left.

434
00:50:42,171 --> 00:50:44,002
Let me see.

435
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:48,362
Somebody's fighting back.

436
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:54,039
- What are you doing?
- I wanna see what's out there.

437
00:50:57,490 --> 00:50:58,923
[Elaine] Oh, my God.

438
00:51:07,169 --> 00:51:09,125
Turn that off. It’s too bright.

439
00:51:09,289 --> 00:51:11,166
- No.
- We can't risk it.

440
00:51:13,969 --> 00:51:15,687
[Elaine] Oh, my God.

441
00:52:08,523 --> 00:52:10,515
Did you sleep at all?

442
00:52:15,603 --> 00:52:18,959
- Is it getting worse?
- What?

443
00:52:19,123 --> 00:52:20,999
The marks on your skin.

444
00:52:22,922 --> 00:52:26,232
When I looked in that light, I
couldn't stand for ten minutes.

445
00:52:26,404 --> 00:52:28,632
Who knows what it did to us?

446
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:34,710
To our bodies.

447
00:52:44,441 --> 00:52:48,992
You remember that first moment when you
saw it, when it completely took over?

448
00:52:49,881 --> 00:52:52,952
Somehow you... you still felt...

449
00:52:57,039 --> 00:52:59,031
...powerful.

450
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:06,710
I still do.

451
00:54:19,034 --> 00:54:21,673
Why don't you take a seat, relax?

452
00:54:33,153 --> 00:54:38,748
All right, I'll bite. What's your plan,
boss? I know you're dying to tell me.

453
00:54:41,992 --> 00:54:43,141
Nothing to say?

454
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:46,108
We're sitting on the
marina for Christ's sakes.

455
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,260
I've noticed that.

456
00:54:47,432 --> 00:54:49,342
There are hundreds of boats
right across the street.

457
00:54:49,512 --> 00:54:51,263
We've been through all this.

458
00:54:51,431 --> 00:54:53,386
Remind us how that worked out last time.

459
00:54:59,311 --> 00:55:01,028
We go quietly this time.

460
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:03,578
And search every boat
till we find the key?

461
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:06,662
- If we have to.
- Great plan, Jarrod.

462
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:10,946
I can't believe you'd even
suggest that after what happened.

463
00:55:11,109 --> 00:55:13,498
You make it sound like it was my fault.

464
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:18,378
I was practically begging,
but you wouldn't listen.

465
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:21,743
And you think Terry
would have listened to me?

466
00:55:24,428 --> 00:55:26,419
All right.

467
00:55:27,588 --> 00:55:30,660
Let's say we make it
out of the building,

468
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:34,342
across the marina, down the dock,
we even find the boat and everything.

469
00:55:34,507 --> 00:55:36,305
Then what?

470
00:55:36,468 --> 00:55:40,778
- Then we get the hell out of Dodge.
- Where to? Carolina? Down the coast?

471
00:55:40,947 --> 00:55:43,745
- Anywhere is better than here.
- How do you know?

472
00:55:43,907 --> 00:55:47,375
We're here. We're alive.

473
00:55:49,826 --> 00:55:51,817
What was that?

474
00:55:53,586 --> 00:55:55,621
What do you see?

475
00:56:01,625 --> 00:56:03,184
Hallelujah.

476
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,769
[man] Come on, come on, come on.

477
00:57:33,378 --> 00:57:35,210
- [crashing]
- Everybody get down!

478
00:57:58,336 --> 00:57:59,928
[Elaine] Jarrod?

479
00:58:00,096 --> 00:58:02,087
Lainey?

480
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:02,760
It worked.

481
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:11,927
I don't believe it. Is it over?

482
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:14,126
It worked. It worked.

483
00:59:14,289 --> 00:59:17,362
- Do you mind?
- [man] By all means, boss.

484
00:59:26,208 --> 00:59:28,927
[Elaine] Do you think there are
more planes where they came from?

485
00:59:29,088 --> 00:59:34,526
Yes. Now they know what to do,
they'll be sending help in no time.

486
00:59:45,567 --> 00:59:46,555
What?

487
00:59:48,127 --> 00:59:50,720
- What is it?
- They're not dead.

488
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:55,925
They're just really, really pissed off.

489
01:00:20,203 --> 01:00:22,196
Something is happening.

490
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:37,197
We got to cover these windows.

491
01:00:38,164 --> 01:00:40,234
Come help me with this.

492
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:43,758
- Get back over here!
- Look, I'll find something.

493
01:00:49,841 --> 01:00:51,241
Here.

494
01:00:57,762 --> 01:01:00,355
Jarrod, what are you doing?

495
01:01:00,521 --> 01:01:02,513
The only thing we can do.

496
01:01:09,401 --> 01:01:11,675
What's this really about, huh?

497
01:01:12,601 --> 01:01:14,591
Those things are coming for us.

498
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,197
You think I haven't noticed
that mess under your shirt?

499
01:01:19,361 --> 01:01:22,352
We stay here and hold up for good.

500
01:01:23,398 --> 01:01:25,469
I agree.

501
01:01:25,639 --> 01:01:29,836
Now he gets to decide everything?
We have no water, no power.

502
01:01:29,998 --> 01:01:31,796
Yeah, but you saw what's out there.

503
01:01:31,959 --> 01:01:35,588
Yeah, and I would rather make a run
for it than stay in a 20-storey target.

504
01:01:35,758 --> 01:01:39,307
Between those things and the
radiation, we are dead up here.

505
01:01:50,557 --> 01:01:51,990
Go! Go!

506
01:01:52,157 --> 01:01:54,306
Go, go, go, go! Cover the flanks!

507
01:01:54,477 --> 01:01:56,388
Look.

508
01:01:56,557 --> 01:01:58,196
- Get off me!
- What do you think you're doing?

509
01:01:58,358 --> 01:02:00,666
- We have to let 'em know we're here.
- We'll let everything know.

510
01:02:00,837 --> 01:02:03,634
You've been saying to wait
for help. Well, help is here.

511
01:02:04,875 --> 01:02:09,108
Does that look like a rescue chopper
to you? Don't you get it? We're at war.

512
01:02:11,115 --> 01:02:13,106
Where are they going?

513
01:02:17,354 --> 01:02:22,952
Those choppers are coming back
for them. We have to go. Come on.

514
01:02:28,514 --> 01:02:30,027
We'll get to the roof.
They'll pick us up.

515
01:02:30,195 --> 01:02:33,185
What if they don't come back?
Look what happened to those planes.

516
01:02:33,353 --> 01:02:35,662
- What good is a helicopter?
- We have to take a chance.

517
01:02:35,833 --> 01:02:39,953
A chance? They just nuked the
city. And you wanna wave hello?

518
01:02:40,114 --> 01:02:42,786
Seriously, you need to
back off. We have to...

519
01:02:43,513 --> 01:02:45,504
[Candice] Oh, shit.

520
01:02:46,232 --> 01:02:47,507
You just gonna stand there?

521
01:02:47,673 --> 01:02:51,984
What happens when the rest of the blinds
fall? We don't have enough bed sheets.

522
01:02:52,832 --> 01:02:55,222
- Come on.
- How can you be so sure?

523
01:02:55,392 --> 01:02:56,984
Let's just go.

524
01:02:57,151 --> 01:02:59,063
You're in no condition
to decide anything.

525
01:02:59,231 --> 01:03:01,463
Who knows what side you're on?

526
01:03:01,632 --> 01:03:02,826
I'm warning you...

527
01:03:02,992 --> 01:03:06,107
[Elaine] Stop it, both of you!

528
01:03:06,271 --> 01:03:09,468
Look at his face. He's sick.

529
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:14,703
- Don't make me hurt you.
- Oh, don't worry.

530
01:03:24,669 --> 01:03:27,104
I am not leaving here without my family.

531
01:03:28,989 --> 01:03:32,777
And there is nothing that
you can do to stop us.

532
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:37,779
Lainey, you have to trust me.

533
01:03:47,507 --> 01:03:49,145
It’s me.

534
01:03:57,427 --> 01:04:00,181
It’s still... me.

535
01:04:07,827 --> 01:04:09,817
I know.

536
01:04:14,146 --> 01:04:16,136
We have to go.

537
01:04:19,865 --> 01:04:21,856
He's gonna get her killed.

538
01:04:23,585 --> 01:04:25,575
Come on.

539
01:04:43,264 --> 01:04:44,491
Come on.

540
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:57,616
All right, let's go.

541
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:14,774
You see anything?

542
01:05:19,421 --> 01:05:21,411
Right there.

543
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:27,411
- [Jarrod] Hey! Help!
- Help us!

544
01:05:27,581 --> 01:05:29,217
- Don't move!
- Don't shoot!

545
01:05:29,379 --> 01:05:33,167
No, no, wait! We need help! Please!

546
01:06:29,335 --> 01:06:30,370
Oh, no, no!

547
01:06:32,814 --> 01:06:34,849
No!

548
01:06:57,452 --> 01:06:59,488
- Hey! Yeah!
- Hey!

549
01:06:59,652 --> 01:07:01,927
Hey!

550
01:07:02,092 --> 01:07:03,491
[indistinct voice over radio]

551
01:07:03,651 --> 01:07:07,566
[man] Copy that. I've
got a visual right now.

552
01:07:08,212 --> 01:07:10,009
Mayday! Mayday!

553
01:07:29,690 --> 01:07:32,602
- [man] Hang on! We're going down!
- No!

554
01:08:19,006 --> 01:08:20,997
[Elaine] Oh, my God.

555
01:08:30,205 --> 01:08:32,195
Come on.

556
01:08:39,804 --> 01:08:42,159
Get off of me! Get off!

557
01:08:49,484 --> 01:08:51,475
Go! Go! Go!

558
01:09:12,921 --> 01:09:15,993
The scaffolding. It's the
only way down. Come on, come on.

559
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,591
[gas hisses]

560
01:10:08,757 --> 01:10:09,986
Jarrod!

561
01:10:16,996 --> 01:10:18,748
- Jarrod!
- Elaine, run!

562
01:12:16,907 --> 01:12:19,865
Vaya con dios, you son of a bitch!

563
01:12:30,946 --> 01:12:33,220
Help me! Help me!

564
01:12:34,905 --> 01:12:36,134
Help me!

565
01:13:30,021 --> 01:13:31,612
Jarrod.

566
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:33,690
Look at me.

567
01:13:33,861 --> 01:13:35,852
Look at me, Jarrod.

568
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:48,691
Gotta get up. Come on.

569
01:14:22,296 --> 01:14:25,448
Come on. It's our only chance.

570
01:15:56,968 --> 01:16:01,087
Lainey, please. You have to go.

571
01:16:03,489 --> 01:16:05,764
I'm not going anywhere without you.

572
01:19:38,392 --> 01:19:39,983
Jarrod.

573
01:21:20,383 --> 01:21:21,863
My baby!

574
01:22:38,217 --> 01:22:40,208
Jarrod.
