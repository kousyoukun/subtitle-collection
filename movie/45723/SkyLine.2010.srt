1
00:00:51,688 --> 00:00:54,715
The sun already?

2
00:01:40,699 --> 00:01:41,970
Jarrod...

3
00:01:45,194 --> 00:01:47,537
Jarrod, wake up.

4
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,834
Okay, it is.

5
00:02:02,754 --> 00:02:04,712
What is this?

6
00:02:05,063 --> 00:02:05,967
I do not know.

7
00:02:09,132 --> 00:02:11,146
Ray!

8
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:17,189
Stay here.

9
00:02:18,868 --> 00:02:20,178
What happens?

10
00:02:20,302 --> 00:02:21,921
He's gonne!

11
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:38,832
Jarrod!

12
00:03:09,304 --> 00:03:13,088
FIFTEEN HOURS BEFORE

13
00:03:16,493 --> 00:03:19,352
I can not decide.

14
00:03:20,194 --> 00:03:22,835
Elaine, chose the last.

15
00:03:31,307 --> 00:03:33,586
Jay-rocker...
T-money...

16
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:38,491
We left history, had a good time,
we were bad.

17
00:03:38,931 --> 00:03:41,220
Not changed at all.

18
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:43,162
Neither Terry...

19
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:45,630
I see.

20
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:47,705
It's very cool.

21
00:03:47,755 --> 00:03:48,898
I can not wait.

22
00:04:16,428 --> 00:04:20,213
I had to think about before
hang up the ruins.

23
00:04:21,498 --> 00:04:22,952
What are you doing here so early?

24
00:04:22,977 --> 00:04:25,943
- It's a wonderful day.
- You think, I do not know.

25
00:04:26,401 --> 00:04:28,481
Got phone Barry
for job...

26
00:04:28,551 --> 00:04:30,029
Tell him to fix it...

27
00:04:30,073 --> 00:04:32,153
I do not work on my birthday.

28
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,751
- Hi.
- God, I should be here then?

29
00:04:39,094 --> 00:04:40,358
It works.

30
00:04:40,445 --> 00:04:41,764
Artistic business, baby.

31
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:43,940
You're sweaty.

32
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,106
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

33
00:05:10,247 --> 00:05:11,817
Yes, I'm fine.

34
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:19,991
Wait to catch me for you.

35
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,191
Ready.

36
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,540
- Thanks.
- Please.

37
00:05:23,964 --> 00:05:26,067
He is my hero.

38
00:05:33,475 --> 00:05:36,000
Jay-rocker
T-Money

39
00:05:37,746 --> 00:05:39,773
Yes we are.

40
00:05:43,728 --> 00:05:46,051
You make a joke!

41
00:05:46,402 --> 00:05:48,640
Better start to get used to it.

42
00:06:22,179 --> 00:06:24,114
Penthouse.

43
00:06:26,258 --> 00:06:28,372
Okay, go.

44
00:06:29,914 --> 00:06:32,111
How is the second most beautiful
guy, I know?

45
00:06:32,123 --> 00:06:33,505
I do not know, how are you?

46
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,697
Good.

47
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,900
Happy Birthday!

48
00:06:38,727 --> 00:06:42,064
- Wow .. say.
- You must be the Elaine? Nice.

49
00:06:42,926 --> 00:06:44,833
This is amazing.

50
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:47,057
Everything here is with automation.

51
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,904
My personal position
in the sky.

52
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:52,063
The view is unrealistic.

53
00:06:53,597 --> 00:06:55,212
Can I ask you something?

54
00:06:55,679 --> 00:06:57,527
You keep my boy fit lad?

55
00:06:57,533 --> 00:06:58,819
Do not answer.

56
00:07:00,783 --> 00:07:02,190
It is his job with pay.

57
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,837
Seriously? Whatever he
gives I pay the double.

58
00:07:06,287 --> 00:07:08,529
I thought this post
was caught?

59
00:07:09,281 --> 00:07:10,249
This I liked.

60
00:07:11,237 --> 00:07:12,677
Your room is here.

61
00:07:12,703 --> 00:07:14,509
Guys, do you want to go to the pool?

62
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,543
For sure.

63
00:07:16,842 --> 00:07:17,930
My baby!

64
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:20,067
Let's go swimming!

65
00:07:27,473 --> 00:07:30,312
- Baby, get me a drink.
- OK just keep it.

66
00:07:31,322 --> 00:07:32,922
The bar is here.

67
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,163
You did good, buddy.

68
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:40,205
Everyone knew that.

69
00:07:40,337 --> 00:07:41,465
Hi, guys.

70
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,744
Hello...

71
00:07:43,043 --> 00:07:44,636
I would not have been able
without you.

72
00:07:45,644 --> 00:07:47,691
Slowly I did, because I make you
designed the walls?

73
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,464
- You look fine.
- And you the same.

74
00:07:50,488 --> 00:07:52,831
Happy Birthday, Terry.

75
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:56,461
Yes, my many years.

76
00:07:58,698 --> 00:08:00,785
I'm liable for it.
Thanks, pal.

77
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:03,066
And I do not know what a gift
can you get me.

78
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,754
I have some ideas about it.

79
00:08:06,317 --> 00:08:07,357
Come on.

80
00:08:10,318 --> 00:08:12,789
From what I see enjoyed by all.

81
00:08:14,617 --> 00:08:16,474
- Baby?
- Yes?

82
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,400
Where is my drink?

83
00:08:19,528 --> 00:08:20,869
My mistake.

84
00:08:20,948 --> 00:08:22,620
Denise, get me a drink.

85
00:08:22,998 --> 00:08:24,938
- Does anybody else?
- No.

86
00:08:29,637 --> 00:08:32,258
This is definitely better
from Brooklyn.

87
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:34,033
I do not know, I like
"four seasons", of the year.

88
00:08:34,154 --> 00:08:36,576
There is one of those,
down the corner.

89
00:08:36,978 --> 00:08:41,930
Tomorrow we will go ride
my boat.

90
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,938
67 feet yacht.

91
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:54,295
National security.

92
00:08:54,736 --> 00:08:58,153
They are here because they know that
the party will be like a "bomb".

93
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:02,795
Cheers.

94
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:06,681
Happy Birthday, Terry!

95
00:09:07,095 --> 00:09:10,718
- Hey, buddy. How do you get?
- Fine.

96
00:09:13,545 --> 00:09:16,201
I want to know someone. Ray!

97
00:09:16,497 --> 00:09:17,833
Wait a minute.

98
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,426
Happy Birthday, boy.

99
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,233
Thanks.

100
00:09:23,254 --> 00:09:24,921
How is doing the "robot fighter"?

101
00:09:24,974 --> 00:09:28,647
The TV, sucks, but the director
loves it, so...

102
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,288
- Hey, this is a child wonder?
- Yes.

103
00:09:32,298 --> 00:09:35,071
And the beautiful lady.

104
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,410
Pleased to meet you, man.

105
00:09:37,947 --> 00:09:40,050
I heard that would come
our team.

106
00:09:41,574 --> 00:09:42,559
I...

107
00:09:42,568 --> 00:09:43,967
Did you find that
settle?

108
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,098
I say, Venice,
is the right place.

109
00:09:46,513 --> 00:09:49,378
- I live there, so I could guide you.
- I remember it, thanks.

110
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:52,858
- I have to go the toilet.
- Okay.

111
00:09:52,873 --> 00:09:55,225
- Can you give me some explanation!
- Baby...

112
00:09:56,771 --> 00:09:59,119
It's perfect, well done mate.

113
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,622
- We must leave.
- What are you saying?

114
00:10:02,684 --> 00:10:04,355
How are you ladies?

115
00:10:05,376 --> 00:10:06,835
- Sorry.
- What are they saying?

116
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,937
- My God!
- Okay, look.

117
00:10:09,498 --> 00:10:11,777
Popped the secret...

118
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:14,449
I was thinking...

119
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,545
... That they should move
in Los Angeles.

120
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:22,405
And what I do here?
Supposed to come back.

121
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:24,238
Could I
faneis useful.

122
00:10:24,883 --> 00:10:26,323
I do not need charity, OK?

123
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:27,653
All right.

124
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:30,071
I need you.

125
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:31,960
I do not know anything
design effects, pal.

126
00:10:31,995 --> 00:10:33,759
- This is bullshit.
- No shit.

127
00:10:34,845 --> 00:10:39,453
You have the eye and you know it.
The computer is a tool.

128
00:10:40,967 --> 00:10:44,559
I do not know, I do not imagine
myself never to live here.

129
00:10:45,314 --> 00:10:47,136
Where do you live?

130
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,892
You got five
project there, I do not know?

131
00:10:49,893 --> 00:10:52,312
Well, not to
do with the money, right?

132
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,251
Always have something to do with the money.

133
00:10:58,221 --> 00:11:00,258
And Elaine?

134
00:11:02,045 --> 00:11:05,921
I take care of everything
you need to do something for yourself.

135
00:11:06,246 --> 00:11:08,591
Terry, you phone up.

136
00:11:08,774 --> 00:11:10,151
Think about it.

137
00:11:27,162 --> 00:11:28,754
Elaine.

138
00:11:34,686 --> 00:11:36,014
Come on.

139
00:11:37,235 --> 00:11:39,620
Supposed to be fun,
what is the problem?

140
00:11:39,638 --> 00:11:41,884
Just forget it, okay?

141
00:11:43,266 --> 00:11:44,266
Look...

142
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:47,803
Terry said that we were everywhere
to stay here, okay?

143
00:11:47,813 --> 00:11:48,761
I had no idea ..

144
00:11:48,771 --> 00:11:50,835
I am late.

145
00:11:51,021 --> 00:11:52,584
What delay?

146
00:11:53,718 --> 00:11:55,159
Delay...

147
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,046
Sorry.

148
00:12:07,174 --> 00:12:08,399
For how long?

149
00:12:08,487 --> 00:12:09,784
I do not know.

150
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:13,622
I felt sick all week,
so I took a test and ..

151
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:16,279
Why not told me?

152
00:12:16,798 --> 00:12:18,983
I wanted to tell you...

153
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:22,389
Believe me, I just do not
to spoil your trip.

154
00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:30,142
Damn.

155
00:12:30,143 --> 00:12:32,056
What can you say only?

156
00:12:32,457 --> 00:12:34,152
What do you say?

157
00:12:36,725 --> 00:12:40,175
- I do not think I'm ready for it.
- Do not feel ready, Jerry?

158
00:12:40,465 --> 00:12:41,849
And what about me?

159
00:12:42,297 --> 00:12:44,896
It has nothing to do with...
We give half a minute?

160
00:12:53,956 --> 00:12:56,873
We have to go below it?

161
00:13:01,372 --> 00:13:03,139
Elaine ..

162
00:13:14,366 --> 00:13:16,559
We have, also has another.

163
00:13:31,631 --> 00:13:34,199
My God!

164
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,944
Sorry, lady, but...

165
00:13:51,053 --> 00:13:53,179
... We have some
complaints about noise.

166
00:13:53,183 --> 00:13:54,381
From whom?

167
00:13:54,943 --> 00:13:56,567
The building is empty.

168
00:13:56,856 --> 00:13:59,135
I understand, but
other half, trying...

169
00:13:59,136 --> 00:14:01,415
... To sleep, so
if you could...

170
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,796
All right.

171
00:14:15,836 --> 00:14:18,781
And they leave.

172
00:14:21,264 --> 00:14:23,596
Well...

173
00:14:24,216 --> 00:14:25,977
No, I have the couch.

174
00:14:25,985 --> 00:14:28,157
Come on, I think it is
space for both of us?

175
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,729
I like the roominess.

176
00:14:30,535 --> 00:14:33,723
Okay then, you will lose.

177
00:14:44,334 --> 00:14:46,176
Good night.

178
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:06,730
FIRST DAY
4:27 PM

179
00:16:08,057 --> 00:16:09,785
Earthquake!

180
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:12,649
Dreaming.

181
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,335
Put out the light.

182
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,222
Ray.

183
00:17:11,705 --> 00:17:13,489
What are you doing?

184
00:17:31,454 --> 00:17:33,063
Ray!

185
00:17:39,968 --> 00:17:42,119
Stay here.

186
00:17:44,127 --> 00:17:45,129
What happens?

187
00:17:45,139 --> 00:17:46,503
Lost!

188
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,433
Jarrod, no.

189
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,184
- No, Jarrod, no.
- What?

190
00:18:10,438 --> 00:18:12,286
What happened, man?

191
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,428
Oh, my God, Jarrod?

192
00:18:19,162 --> 00:18:21,786
Please ..
What's happening?

193
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:25,911
Jarrod, for God.

194
00:18:32,663 --> 00:18:34,432
What happened to him?

195
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:40,081
Where's Ray?

196
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:42,475
- Who is Ray?
- No, no...

197
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:44,748
Where is?

198
00:18:44,763 --> 00:18:45,969
- Lost!
- What do you mean gone?

199
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,037
I mean, gone!

200
00:18:47,072 --> 00:18:49,344
- He fell down? - No. ..
- Does he jumped - No!

201
00:18:49,423 --> 00:18:50,831
Help him, Terry!

202
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,649
Went out
when he saw the light.

203
00:18:58,267 --> 00:19:01,193
Then simply disappeared.

204
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,398
Terry, please!

205
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:31,518
Jarrod, look at me.

206
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:34,526
What happened?
What did you see?

207
00:19:36,687 --> 00:19:38,223
Be careful.

208
00:19:48,472 --> 00:19:50,335
Jarrod, what happened?

209
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:54,719
I do not know.

210
00:19:59,006 --> 00:20:01,079
It was like pulling a...

211
00:20:01,871 --> 00:20:04,127
... Light.

212
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,971
- Open the blinds.
- No...

213
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,587
- Open the blinds.
- No!

214
00:20:19,608 --> 00:20:21,136
Damn...

215
00:20:32,033 --> 00:20:34,007
Get something down there.

216
00:20:34,071 --> 00:20:35,295
What?

217
00:20:35,913 --> 00:20:37,410
Jarrod, look.

218
00:20:50,769 --> 00:20:52,408
I do not see anything.

219
00:20:54,409 --> 00:20:56,401
There are people on rooftops.

220
00:20:56,492 --> 00:20:57,711
And what they do there?

221
00:20:58,611 --> 00:21:00,007
I do not know.

222
00:21:02,536 --> 00:21:04,269
We go to check it.

223
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,473
You never know what can be
out there.

224
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,153
- Media.
- Okay.

225
00:21:13,013 --> 00:21:15,037
I'll call the police.

226
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:21,051
- Will draw some pictures.
- Unable to go out there.

227
00:21:22,555 --> 00:21:24,954
I will not go myself.

228
00:21:24,969 --> 00:21:26,577
I do not lift.

229
00:21:32,201 --> 00:21:33,335
Gun?

230
00:21:33,673 --> 00:21:35,306
Seriously?

231
00:21:35,734 --> 00:21:38,547
See more news and
Find out what the hell is going on.

232
00:21:39,189 --> 00:21:40,669
We will return soon.

233
00:21:42,573 --> 00:21:45,037
- Jarrod.
- Look at me.

234
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,541
Come on.

235
00:21:55,546 --> 00:21:57,041
Turn quickly.

236
00:22:22,218 --> 00:22:23,681
The stairs are out of here.

237
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,361
Damn ..

238
00:22:53,688 --> 00:22:54,840
What happens?

239
00:22:55,211 --> 00:22:56,730
Let's see.

240
00:22:57,082 --> 00:22:58,314
What do you want the gun?

241
00:22:58,729 --> 00:23:00,952
Turn back
your room quickly.

242
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:04,081
And then silence.

243
00:23:13,005 --> 00:23:15,495
Are you sure about that?

244
00:23:25,886 --> 00:23:28,678
There is nothing new
from 4 in the morning.

245
00:23:30,654 --> 00:23:32,438
Denis, try a little TV.

246
00:23:43,138 --> 00:23:44,842
Emergency broadcast system.

247
00:24:02,028 --> 00:24:03,804
Calm things down.

248
00:24:08,745 --> 00:24:10,229
Hell, Jarrod.

249
00:24:10,704 --> 00:24:12,240
It told me to
keep it open.

250
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,602
There was no one behind you.

251
00:24:16,133 --> 00:24:17,457
Sorry.

252
00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:21,273
Get down.

253
00:24:26,324 --> 00:24:27,624
What now?

254
00:24:29,922 --> 00:24:31,542
Let us no better off.

255
00:24:38,252 --> 00:24:41,238
Hi, here Jackie. Please
leave your message.

256
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:44,645
Mom, I am.

257
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:46,384
Something happened and ..

258
00:24:48,172 --> 00:24:50,162
Pick up.

259
00:24:50,883 --> 00:24:52,633
Please, just...

260
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:56,222
... Take me back soon
listen to this.

261
00:25:55,438 --> 00:25:57,109
Shit.

262
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:32,345
My God, this is the case
I think?

263
00:26:36,741 --> 00:26:39,214
My God!

264
00:27:14,602 --> 00:27:16,144
- Get back.
- What is it?

265
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,170
Run!

266
00:27:24,507 --> 00:27:26,213
Come on, pull!

267
00:27:26,234 --> 00:27:27,930
Get back!
Back!

268
00:27:31,178 --> 00:27:32,570
Come on!

269
00:27:43,641 --> 00:27:44,956
Hurry!

270
00:27:48,502 --> 00:27:50,672
Elaine, no!

271
00:28:03,051 --> 00:28:05,739
- Make room, make room!
- Okay.

272
00:28:09,936 --> 00:28:11,340
Honey, are you okay?

273
00:28:12,522 --> 00:28:14,482
I feel as if I fire.

274
00:28:22,994 --> 00:28:24,074
Give it to me.

275
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,270
I'll pass soon,
I promise.

276
00:28:46,532 --> 00:28:47,648
Are you okay?

277
00:28:55,888 --> 00:28:58,146
Have you and you...

278
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:03,573
How...

279
00:29:04,474 --> 00:29:10,974
Translation hearsay
- KIRIOUS -

280
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,948
My God!

281
00:29:25,246 --> 00:29:27,271
All of these people.

282
00:29:33,958 --> 00:29:36,558
What do they want?

283
00:29:36,563 --> 00:29:38,641
Not interested to know.

284
00:29:39,536 --> 00:29:41,088
God, I do not think so ..

285
00:29:41,726 --> 00:29:43,608
So, how is it possible?

286
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:45,691
From the moment you
look to the light ..

287
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:51,342
... To grab.

288
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:54,438
- It's like...
- To take control of you.

289
00:29:55,631 --> 00:29:58,971
Who would not want to see
something so beautiful?

290
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:03,264
It is really intelligent.

291
00:30:03,936 --> 00:30:05,242
Enough of this shit.

292
00:30:06,146 --> 00:30:07,820
I have an idea.

293
00:30:08,434 --> 00:30:09,364
Where are you going?

294
00:30:09,369 --> 00:30:10,695
- The Walt. - What's up with that?
- Terry?

295
00:30:10,928 --> 00:30:13,710
- I worry about him. - Terry?
- Everything is under control.

296
00:30:44,649 --> 00:30:45,977
Are you okay?

297
00:30:46,788 --> 00:30:48,632
Yes, nothing.

298
00:30:48,958 --> 00:30:50,113
Let me see it.

299
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:52,008
I said nothing.

300
00:30:54,424 --> 00:30:58,477
- Are you okay.
- Fine.

301
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:22,138
Walt?

302
00:31:36,385 --> 00:31:38,535
Walt?

303
00:31:39,836 --> 00:31:40,992
Walt?

304
00:31:44,419 --> 00:31:46,153
Walt?

305
00:31:48,453 --> 00:31:49,833
Are you there?

306
00:32:01,707 --> 00:32:03,487
What the hell are you?

307
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:05,194
Hiding.

308
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:08,899
I saw all these
People in the sky.

309
00:32:09,313 --> 00:32:11,527
They pulled over.

310
00:32:12,102 --> 00:32:15,010
Come on, get your car
and leave from Los Angeles.

311
00:32:15,835 --> 00:32:17,115
Get down!

312
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:24,436
Close your blinds!

313
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,541
No!

314
00:33:39,552 --> 00:33:40,706
Walt!

315
00:34:10,012 --> 00:34:11,230
Did you hear that?

316
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:17,309
What happened?
Talk to me!

317
00:34:18,543 --> 00:34:20,221
I take my vessel
and the crushing of here.

318
00:34:20,327 --> 00:34:21,326
What happened?

319
00:34:21,567 --> 00:34:22,731
They took Walt.

320
00:34:22,778 --> 00:34:24,264
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

321
00:34:24,388 --> 00:34:27,596
This was different. He joined
the building and searched.

322
00:34:28,571 --> 00:34:30,526
Then you better leave.

323
00:34:30,647 --> 00:34:32,022
Wait a minute.

324
00:34:32,057 --> 00:34:33,819
I'm the only one
saw these pictures?

325
00:34:34,916 --> 00:34:38,358
What happens out there,
are everywhere.

326
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:40,175
It is everywhere.

327
00:34:41,076 --> 00:34:42,842
It is in the water.

328
00:34:43,404 --> 00:34:46,866
However, it took them a long
time to get to the roof.

329
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:49,177
Can we
there in 2 minutes.

330
00:34:49,568 --> 00:34:52,386
You have no idea what
are able to do.

331
00:34:52,754 --> 00:34:55,072
I know you scared, alright,
We all fear...

332
00:34:55,121 --> 00:34:56,423
But it is not
to hide my head

333
00:34:56,424 --> 00:34:57,725
the sand, hoping
simply disappear.

334
00:34:57,765 --> 00:35:00,777
- I'm not saying that.
- Relax, pal.

335
00:35:00,808 --> 00:35:04,276
How do I do this?
Is the whole building!

336
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,000
Terry?

337
00:35:07,035 --> 00:35:08,440
It is the timer.

338
00:35:09,594 --> 00:35:11,279
My God.

339
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,251
Shit!

340
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:25,194
Hide!
Come quickly!

341
00:36:34,542 --> 00:36:36,113
You're disgusting!

342
00:36:36,786 --> 00:36:38,410
What the hell happened to you?

343
00:36:44,489 --> 00:36:47,283
- We will discuss later.
- Yes, indeed.

344
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:00,834
I do not like none of them
but if we are not seen or heard.

345
00:37:01,402 --> 00:37:03,292
... We could
sit here quietly...

346
00:37:03,309 --> 00:37:04,819
For how long?

347
00:37:04,882 --> 00:37:07,218
They gather people
out there, it's simple.

348
00:37:07,637 --> 00:37:10,420
The sooner we leave
the city, the better.

349
00:37:11,524 --> 00:37:12,662
He is right.

350
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:14,804
Jarrod.

351
00:37:14,805 --> 00:37:16,251
If we can get to
vessel may have a chance!

352
00:37:16,265 --> 00:37:18,415
- Yes, but will not go!
- It!

353
00:37:20,934 --> 00:37:22,883
We must try.

354
00:37:22,973 --> 00:37:24,594
Get your stuff.

355
00:37:24,917 --> 00:37:26,883
Get food and water.

356
00:37:27,252 --> 00:37:29,036
Come on.

357
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,546
Come on.

358
00:38:07,383 --> 00:38:08,871
Okay, come on.

359
00:38:09,058 --> 00:38:12,492
Look, the sooner we get there,
the faster you go.

360
00:38:12,493 --> 00:38:13,548
Be careful.

361
00:38:14,433 --> 00:38:15,954
Come on, come on.

362
00:38:16,437 --> 00:38:17,923
What are you doing?

363
00:38:17,924 --> 00:38:19,409
I try to run, I know the way!

364
00:38:19,442 --> 00:38:21,830
- Get together and you bitch.
- Candice?

365
00:38:23,106 --> 00:38:24,360
Candice!

366
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:27,693
Get in the car!

367
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,176
Terry, sorry.

368
00:39:15,783 --> 00:39:18,268
- Hurry up.
- What do you think I do?

369
00:39:23,758 --> 00:39:24,622
Cut speed.

370
00:39:24,701 --> 00:39:25,339
No.

371
00:39:25,344 --> 00:39:26,611
Stop!

372
00:39:28,088 --> 00:39:29,289
Need help?

373
00:39:29,338 --> 00:39:31,524
- No, go ahead, we're fine.
- But, baby...

374
00:39:31,555 --> 00:39:34,511
Enough!
I said, we're okay.

375
00:40:08,188 --> 00:40:09,323
Come here, quick!

376
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:17,517
Terry!

377
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:30,434
I got you!

378
00:40:36,082 --> 00:40:39,222
Jarrod!
Come here quickly!

379
00:40:41,281 --> 00:40:42,754
Jerry, fast!

380
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,190
What are you doing!

381
00:40:57,958 --> 00:40:59,628
Hurry!

382
00:41:07,086 --> 00:41:09,035
Open!

383
00:41:09,606 --> 00:41:11,440
Damn, come on!

384
00:41:11,486 --> 00:41:14,701
- Open ..
- Come on.

385
00:41:17,759 --> 00:41:20,034
Open, ruins!

386
00:41:23,727 --> 00:41:25,008
Get back!
Back!

387
00:41:50,124 --> 00:41:52,112
My God!

388
00:41:53,994 --> 00:41:55,776
Someone help!

389
00:41:59,948 --> 00:42:02,876
The keys...
Where are the keys?

390
00:42:36,752 --> 00:42:38,156
Are you okay?

391
00:42:38,286 --> 00:42:39,836
I'm fine.

392
00:42:41,289 --> 00:42:42,515
My God!

393
00:42:43,776 --> 00:42:44,926
My God!

394
00:42:44,935 --> 00:42:46,014
Miss no
need to do.

395
00:42:46,024 --> 00:42:47,350
What are you doing?

396
00:42:48,944 --> 00:42:50,398
It's alive!

397
00:42:50,632 --> 00:42:51,632
Colin!

398
00:42:54,232 --> 00:42:55,884
Help me!

399
00:43:13,969 --> 00:43:15,542
Come on, come on!

400
00:43:23,346 --> 00:43:25,666
Go!

401
00:43:41,816 --> 00:43:43,402
We go from
the back door.

402
00:43:53,852 --> 00:43:55,356
Run!

403
00:44:24,846 --> 00:44:26,573
Come on, go!

404
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,800
Come on!

405
00:44:50,457 --> 00:44:51,854
Do not stop!

406
00:44:53,657 --> 00:44:54,739
Open the door!

407
00:45:01,066 --> 00:45:03,928
Hurry!
Open it!

408
00:45:07,279 --> 00:45:08,601
Come in.

409
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:19,988
At the top is the safest
place, I think.

410
00:45:19,989 --> 00:45:21,542
And how do you know how
is not there!

411
00:45:23,332 --> 00:45:25,826
If you want to sit here
You can do it.

412
00:45:26,602 --> 00:45:27,691
Come on.

413
00:45:32,334 --> 00:45:34,343
Come quickly ..
Hurry!

414
00:46:23,361 --> 00:46:27,046
Could not
the book.

415
00:46:36,284 --> 00:46:37,816
Come help me with this.

416
00:46:56,298 --> 00:46:57,810
It's better than nothing, right?

417
00:46:59,704 --> 00:47:01,142
Well what you say.

418
00:47:03,031 --> 00:47:04,381
What are you doing?

419
00:47:04,416 --> 00:47:06,320
I like it or not,
this happens.

420
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:11,482
Need to appear strong.

421
00:47:20,365 --> 00:47:22,062
Is all well?

422
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:26,128
Hurt?

423
00:47:27,001 --> 00:47:30,185
No...
I'm okay.

424
00:47:37,428 --> 00:47:40,220
- What now?
- We live here...

425
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:43,817
We watch and pray
let us find someone.

426
00:47:43,863 --> 00:47:44,925
He is right.

427
00:47:45,824 --> 00:47:47,601
Someone will come.

428
00:47:47,834 --> 00:47:49,916
I can keep it forever.

429
00:47:51,381 --> 00:47:52,613
Right?

430
00:48:01,142 --> 00:48:03,476
Honey, you better
stick together.

431
00:48:03,482 --> 00:48:04,859
I can not.

432
00:48:05,027 --> 00:48:06,020
Smoke...

433
00:48:07,136 --> 00:48:10,508
Given the circumstances,
I find it reasonable to smoke.

434
00:48:10,516 --> 00:48:11,738
Candice...

435
00:48:14,398 --> 00:48:16,721
I'm pregnant, right?

436
00:48:18,143 --> 00:48:19,865
And I thought...

437
00:48:21,343 --> 00:48:23,416
... That with all this stress...

438
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:30,464
Everything will be okay.

439
00:48:34,531 --> 00:48:37,010
I did not say
even my mother.

440
00:48:49,018 --> 00:48:53,892
Come on, boss. Let's leave
to sleep. We do shift work.

441
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,090
Both of us?

442
00:48:57,634 --> 00:49:01,024
If you try something, we
meet one another.

443
00:49:24,208 --> 00:49:25,940
I hate Los Angeles.

444
00:49:54,548 --> 00:49:56,922
I saw all night soul.

445
00:50:00,126 --> 00:50:01,844
Perhaps the worst
be passed.

446
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,552
Maybe not.

447
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:10,022
What do you think was
these things?

448
00:50:10,892 --> 00:50:12,122
I do not know.

449
00:50:13,544 --> 00:50:14,908
Does not matter?

450
00:50:20,062 --> 00:50:22,605
It looks real.

451
00:50:25,766 --> 00:50:27,766
But it is.

452
00:50:28,582 --> 00:50:30,378
And you arranged to meet.

453
00:50:32,887 --> 00:50:34,469
What means this?

454
00:50:34,838 --> 00:50:36,920
The city was deserted.

455
00:50:37,689 --> 00:50:39,449
We must survive.

456
00:50:41,918 --> 00:50:44,338
There will remain, and many of us.

457
00:51:05,487 --> 00:51:07,327
What do you see?

458
00:51:10,848 --> 00:51:12,584
One of the fights.

459
00:51:15,554 --> 00:51:16,553
What are you doing?

460
00:51:16,568 --> 00:51:18,214
I want to see what's out there.

461
00:51:32,086 --> 00:51:33,204
Turn it!

462
00:51:33,218 --> 00:51:34,416
It's very dark!

463
00:51:34,453 --> 00:51:36,617
No!
I can not take chances.

464
00:51:38,786 --> 00:51:40,657
My God!

465
00:52:18,532 --> 00:52:21,534
SECOND DAY

466
00:52:35,818 --> 00:52:38,219
Slept at all?

467
00:52:43,233 --> 00:52:44,593
Do you think worse?

468
00:52:46,109 --> 00:52:46,973
What?

469
00:52:46,984 --> 00:52:48,522
The scars on your skin.

470
00:52:50,875 --> 00:52:54,854
When I looked in that light, not
I could not stand for 10 minutes.

471
00:52:54,978 --> 00:52:56,980
Who knows what we did...

472
00:53:01,588 --> 00:53:03,572
... In our bodies.

473
00:53:12,967 --> 00:53:15,609
Remember the first time
that looked?

474
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:17,704
Where in you completely...

475
00:53:19,136 --> 00:53:21,402
For some reason,
I felt beautiful...

476
00:53:26,182 --> 00:53:27,898
... Possible.

477
00:53:34,312 --> 00:53:36,145
And still
I feel that way.

478
00:54:51,764 --> 00:54:55,261
Why not sit and relax?

479
00:55:06,274 --> 00:55:08,978
Okay, give up.

480
00:55:09,841 --> 00:55:11,392
So what is the
design your boss?

481
00:55:11,393 --> 00:55:12,943
Because I know
Dying to tell me so.

482
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:17,846
You got something to say?

483
00:55:18,556 --> 00:55:20,434
We are near the port.

484
00:55:20,469 --> 00:55:21,535
I noticed that.

485
00:55:21,742 --> 00:55:23,580
On the other side of the road
There are hundreds of ships.

486
00:55:23,587 --> 00:55:25,655
We have retry it!

487
00:55:25,666 --> 00:55:27,880
Remind us how you reached
the last time?

488
00:55:33,688 --> 00:55:35,638
This time we'll go quietly.

489
00:55:35,775 --> 00:55:38,158
Each will look for all ships
until you find a key?

490
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:39,770
This should be done.

491
00:55:39,949 --> 00:55:41,537
Unfortunate design, Jarrod.

492
00:55:42,438 --> 00:55:44,056
I can not
believe suggest...

493
00:55:44,057 --> 00:55:45,674
... So,
After all what happened.

494
00:55:46,172 --> 00:55:48,444
What do you say now?
That was my fault.

495
00:55:48,822 --> 00:55:50,475
In begged...

496
00:55:51,972 --> 00:55:54,279
... But did not hear.

497
00:55:54,323 --> 00:55:57,989
And do you think
Terry would listen?

498
00:56:00,036 --> 00:56:01,288
Well...

499
00:56:03,192 --> 00:56:05,162
Let's say we go
the building.

500
00:56:06,372 --> 00:56:08,787
Pass the port
go to the marina.

501
00:56:09,205 --> 00:56:11,516
We find a boat
and then what?

502
00:56:12,642 --> 00:56:15,198
- Then simply thrashing out of here.
- For who?

503
00:56:15,528 --> 00:56:17,032
In Carolina, the coast?

504
00:56:17,259 --> 00:56:19,834
- Anywhere is better than here!
- How do you know that?

505
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:21,638
We are here.

506
00:56:22,922 --> 00:56:24,320
We are alive.

507
00:56:26,173 --> 00:56:27,524
What was that?

508
00:56:30,042 --> 00:56:31,042
What do you see?

509
00:56:38,857 --> 00:56:40,075
Hallelujah.

510
00:57:54,601 --> 00:57:57,100
Come... come...

511
00:58:14,852 --> 00:58:16,390
Everybody down!

512
00:58:42,514 --> 00:58:43,816
Elaine?

513
00:59:45,974 --> 00:59:47,792
It worked.

514
00:59:53,589 --> 00:59:56,452
I think not!
Over?

515
00:59:56,811 --> 00:59:58,582
It worked.

516
00:59:59,229 --> 01:00:00,434
I?

517
01:00:01,438 --> 01:00:02,936
All yours, boss.

518
01:00:11,529 --> 01:00:14,074
Do you think that will come
and other planes?

519
01:00:14,558 --> 01:00:15,721
Yes.

520
01:00:16,498 --> 01:00:17,974
Yes, I now know
what to do.

521
01:00:18,578 --> 01:00:20,355
You should send aid now.

522
01:00:31,757 --> 01:00:33,059
What?

523
01:00:34,496 --> 01:00:35,780
What happens?

524
01:00:35,983 --> 01:00:37,261
Not dead.

525
01:00:38,712 --> 01:00:43,088
It's just too...
Very pissed off.

526
01:01:08,072 --> 01:01:09,536
Something happens.

527
01:01:23,047 --> 01:01:25,372
We must close the windows.

528
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:28,074
Help me with this.

529
01:01:29,212 --> 01:01:30,628
Come here quickly!

530
01:01:31,134 --> 01:01:33,393
I will find something.

531
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:40,066
Here.

532
01:01:47,142 --> 01:01:48,960
Jarrod, what do you do?

533
01:01:50,303 --> 01:01:51,989
What do you do?

534
01:01:59,444 --> 01:02:00,984
What about you?

535
01:02:02,458 --> 01:02:04,542
These things will come
let us look.

536
01:02:05,626 --> 01:02:08,302
You think that I did not understand
What character are you?

537
01:02:09,516 --> 01:02:12,663
We'll stay here and wait
hidden until the end!

538
01:02:13,612 --> 01:02:15,227
I agree.

539
01:02:16,228 --> 01:02:18,100
Then that was it.

540
01:02:18,504 --> 01:02:19,694
We have no water.

541
01:02:20,074 --> 01:02:21,054
Neither electricity.

542
01:02:21,066 --> 01:02:22,760
Yes, but you saw what
is out there.

543
01:02:22,812 --> 01:02:23,598
Yes.

544
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:25,318
Only I prefer
To die trying...

545
01:02:25,319 --> 01:02:27,027
... Rather than stay in a
"Target", 20 storeys.

546
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:28,995
Among these
creatures, and...

547
01:02:28,996 --> 01:02:30,960
... Radiation, we
dead up here.

548
01:02:47,954 --> 01:02:49,432
What do you want from me!

549
01:02:49,493 --> 01:02:51,611
- What the hell do you think?
- You must tell them that we are here.

550
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:54,080
- You'll ruin everything!
- Let me cry for help.

551
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:55,944
The rescue us here!

552
01:02:56,955 --> 01:02:58,680
- I like to rescue!
- What are you talking about?

553
01:02:58,749 --> 01:03:00,028
I do not understand?

554
01:03:00,082 --> 01:03:01,282
We are at war!

555
01:03:03,631 --> 01:03:05,183
Where to go?

556
01:03:10,414 --> 01:03:14,155
The helicopter will return to pick them up,
forward.

557
01:03:14,166 --> 01:03:15,542
Come on.

558
01:03:21,462 --> 01:03:23,650
Just turn will take us.

559
01:03:23,655 --> 01:03:26,622
What if it does not come back?
Look what happened to those planes.

560
01:03:26,643 --> 01:03:28,825
- How to afford a helicopter?
- We must take the risk!

561
01:03:28,832 --> 01:03:30,396
Take the risk?

562
01:03:30,686 --> 01:03:32,329
Devastation throughout the city.

563
01:03:32,359 --> 01:03:33,697
Do you think you will live
enough to leave?

564
01:03:33,706 --> 01:03:35,413
Seriously,
Leave us!

565
01:03:35,826 --> 01:03:36,770
We have to do...

566
01:03:37,706 --> 01:03:39,204
Shit.

567
01:03:39,832 --> 01:03:41,500
There you stand?

568
01:03:41,522 --> 01:03:43,610
What will happen when
fall all the planes?

569
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:45,699
At least we have a chance!

570
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:49,756
- Come on.
- How can you be so sure?

571
01:03:49,841 --> 01:03:50,989
Just go!

572
01:03:51,528 --> 01:03:53,726
Not being able to
decide anything.

573
01:03:53,793 --> 01:03:55,076
Who knows whose
Being part.

574
01:03:56,027 --> 01:03:58,020
I warn you.

575
01:03:58,105 --> 01:04:00,401
Stop!
Both of you!

576
01:04:00,874 --> 01:04:02,962
Look at his face.

577
01:04:03,294 --> 01:04:04,840
It's sick.

578
01:04:06,919 --> 01:04:10,042
- Do not make me hurt you.
- Do not worry about it.

579
01:04:19,918 --> 01:04:23,166
I'm not leaving without my family.

580
01:04:25,074 --> 01:04:26,416
And you can not
to do anything...

581
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:28,988
... To stop us.

582
01:04:31,515 --> 01:04:33,421
I want to trust me.

583
01:04:43,453 --> 01:04:45,216
I am.

584
01:04:53,732 --> 01:04:57,133
I'm still... I.

585
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:06,320
I know.

586
01:05:11,234 --> 01:05:13,700
We should go.

587
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:20,124
I will do, to be killed.

588
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:22,598
Come on.

589
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:41,231
Come on.

590
01:05:52,249 --> 01:05:53,723
Okay, go.

591
01:06:11,302 --> 01:06:12,814
You see?

592
01:06:17,371 --> 01:06:18,996
There is.

593
01:06:24,287 --> 01:06:26,855
- Help us!
- Do not move!

594
01:06:27,022 --> 01:06:28,904
- No, wait
- Do not shoot.

595
01:06:28,915 --> 01:06:32,097
- Stay where you are!
- We need help, please.

596
01:06:37,607 --> 01:06:39,888
Go over there now!

597
01:07:33,893 --> 01:07:35,209
No!

598
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:05,932
We carry two people.

599
01:08:06,297 --> 01:08:09,273
Roger, I see two people in
shelter, go get them...

600
01:08:10,864 --> 01:08:12,650
Danger! Danger!

601
01:08:33,122 --> 01:08:34,574
Get back now!

602
01:08:34,784 --> 01:08:36,919
No!

603
01:09:35,927 --> 01:09:37,574
Come on.

604
01:09:46,186 --> 01:09:47,558
Take it from me!

605
01:09:56,238 --> 01:09:58,356
Go!

606
01:10:20,732 --> 01:10:22,023
In the elevator.

607
01:10:22,338 --> 01:10:24,214
It is the only way to
go down. Go, go.

608
01:10:57,486 --> 01:10:59,027
Come, come!

609
01:11:28,047 --> 01:11:29,262
Ellie, run!

610
01:13:32,655 --> 01:13:35,406
Greetings, motherfucker!

611
01:13:46,919 --> 01:13:49,104
Help me!

612
01:13:51,610 --> 01:13:52,479
Help me!

613
01:14:00,350 --> 01:14:02,040
Help!

614
01:14:47,988 --> 01:14:49,525
Jarrod.

615
01:14:50,205 --> 01:14:51,523
Look at me.

616
01:14:52,179 --> 01:14:53,841
Look at me, Jarrod.

617
01:15:04,671 --> 01:15:07,179
Come on, come on.

618
01:15:44,232 --> 01:15:46,136
Come on, we got almost.

619
01:17:21,864 --> 01:17:23,472
Elaine, please.

620
01:17:24,444 --> 01:17:25,928
We must go.

621
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:30,986
I'm not going anywhere without you.

622
01:19:14,171 --> 01:19:16,968
THIRD DAY

623
01:21:12,128 --> 01:21:13,926
Jarrod!

624
01:21:14,672 --> 01:21:16,757
No!

625
01:22:58,086 --> 01:23:00,286
My baby!

626
01:24:19,325 --> 01:24:21,109
Jarrod ..
