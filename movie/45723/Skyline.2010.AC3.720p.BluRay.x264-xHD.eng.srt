118
00:10:47,412 --> 00:10:51,470

00:11:16,786 --> 00:11:20,026
- You got five year plan I don't know about?

129
00:11:20,845 --> 00:11:22,227

132
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:35,674
Terry, there's a call for you at the desk.

133
00:11:36,344 --> 00:11:37,721

145
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:33,092

149
00:12:53,745 --> 00:12:55,009
Shit.

150
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:56,986
Is that all you have to say?

151
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,806
What do you want me to say?

152
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,800
- I dont think I'm ready for this.
- You are not fit Jarrod?

153
00:13:04,822 --> 00:13:05,628

160
00:14:12,906 --> 00:14:14,862
...We received some
complaints about noise.

161
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,130
From whom?

162
00:14:16,753 --> 00:14:18,085
The building is half empty.

163
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:21,441
I understand ma'am, but
the other half is trying to sleep.

164
00:14:21,655 --> 00:14:23,911
So if you don't mind

space for both of us?

168
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:53,085
- I like space.
- Ooh alright.

169
00:14:53,528 --> 00:14:57,077
Maybe you'll change your atitude.

170
00:15:05,675 --> 00:15:07,517
Good night.

171
00:15:22,817 --> 00:15:27,130
FIRST DAY
4:27 PM

172
00:16:26,075 --> 00:16:27,051
Earthquake!

173
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,016
Put out the light.

174
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:27,622
Ray. What are you doing?

175
00:17:45,747 --> 00:17:47,397
Ray!

176
00:17:54,254 --> 00:17:55,487
Stay here.

177
00:17:57,861 --> 00:17:59,699
- What happened?
- He is gone.

178
00:18:09,825 --> 00:18:11,249
Jarrod, no.

179
00:18:12,343 --> 00:18:15,961
- No, Jarrod, no.
- Jarrod... no.

180
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:18,937
What's going on, man?

181
00:18:31,725 --> 00:18:34,243
Please ..
What has happened to you?

182
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:38,953
- Jarrod..
- Oh God.

183
00:18:39,253 --> 00:18:40,283
Jarrod...

184
00:18:44,633 --> 00:18:45,858
What's wrong with him?

185
00:18:47,545 --> 00:18:49,775
- Jarrod, Oh my God?

186
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:53,759
- Where is Ray? Where is Ray
- No, no...

187
00:18:54,229 --> 00:18:55,818
- Jarrod.
- Where is he?

188
00:18:55,908 --> 00:18:57,019
- Gone!
- What do you mean he is gone?

189
00:18:57,172 --> 00:18:58,633
- I mean, he is gone!
- Did he fall?

190
00:18:58,936 --> 00:19:00,463
- No. ..
- Did he jump?
- No!

191
00:19:05,619 --> 00:19:07,104
- He went outside!
- To the light.

192
00:19:08,928 --> 00:19:11,679
Then he just disappeared.

193
00:19:18,412 --> 00:19:19,915
Terry, please!

194
00:19:40,961 --> 00:19:43,647
What did you see?
What did you see?

195
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:47,153
Talk to him.

196
00:19:56,742 --> 00:19:59,052
Jarrod, what happened?

197
00:20:01,455 --> 00:20:02,758
I do not know.

198
00:20:07,683 --> 00:20:11,472
I was being pulled.
Towards this light.

199
00:20:22,677 --> 00:20:24,022
- Open the blinds.
- No...

200
00:20:24,804 --> 00:20:26,693
- Open the blinds.
- No!

201
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:27,762
Goddamn...

202
00:20:39,098 --> 00:20:40,796
There is something down there.

203
00:20:41,085 --> 00:20:42,218
What?

204
00:20:42,644 --> 00:20:43,781
Jarrod, check this out.

205
00:20:56,393 --> 00:20:58,129
I do not see anything.

206
00:21:00,104 --> 00:21:03,286
- There are people on roof.
- What are they doing.

207
00:21:04,653 --> 00:21:05,702
I do not know.

208
00:21:08,415 --> 00:21:09,754
We should check it out.

209
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:11,325
Yeah. Don't know what is up there.

210
00:21:14,913 --> 00:21:17,246
I'll be okay.

211
00:21:18,721 --> 00:21:20,168
I am calling the police.

212
00:21:23,544 --> 00:21:25,667
- I'll take some pictures.
- Don't go out there.

213
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:29,470
I am not going out there along.

214
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:31,044
I just keeps ringing.

215
00:21:36,974 --> 00:21:37,994
A gun?

216
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,466
Really?

217
00:21:40,381 --> 00:21:42,453
Check the news and
find out what the hell is going on.

218
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,168
- Terry..
- We 'll be right back.

219
00:21:46,704 --> 00:21:47,964
- Jarrod.
- Look at me.

220
00:21:57,266 --> 00:21:58,483
Lets go.

221
00:21:58,967 --> 00:22:00,640
Hurry back.

222
00:22:28,118 --> 00:22:30,169
The stairs is this way.

223
00:22:58,169 --> 00:22:59,530
What's going on?

224
00:22:59,787 --> 00:23:00,978
How old is your dog?

225
00:23:01,557 --> 00:23:02,698
What are doing with the gun?

226
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,281
Get back in your apartment. Go..

227
00:23:05,607 --> 00:23:08,067
And keep it down.

228
00:23:14,736 --> 00:23:18,729
Hey, are you sure about this?

229
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,648
There is nothing new
since 4 am.

230
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:34,987
Denis, please check the TV.

231
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,387
Its calm.

232
00:24:10,774 --> 00:24:11,780
Damn it, Jarrod.

233
00:24:12,341 --> 00:24:13,791
You didnt tell me to
hold it open.

234
00:24:14,216 --> 00:24:16,414
I thought I was coming to this..

235
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,694
I am sorry.

236
00:24:21,596 --> 00:24:22,626
Get down.

237
00:24:26,972 --> 00:24:28,598
What now?

238
00:24:30,424 --> 00:24:31,899
Let's get a better look.

239
00:24:39,285 --> 00:24:41,836
Hi, this is Jackie. Please
leave a message.

240
00:24:42,588 --> 00:24:44,637
Mom, its me.

241
00:24:45,434 --> 00:24:49,475
Something happened and .. Pick up.

242
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:55,343
Please, just... call me back as soon as you get this.

243
00:25:52,515 --> 00:25:54,379
Holy shit.

244
00:26:24,547 --> 00:26:25,638
I can see it.

245
00:26:33,206 --> 00:26:34,547
My God!

246
00:27:08,382 --> 00:27:10,159
- Lets go.
- What is it?

247
00:27:11,261 --> 00:27:12,842
- Run!
- Lets go.

248
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:19,834
Come on, pull!

249
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:21,069
Back up!
Back up!

250
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,462
Come on!

251
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:44,386
Elaine, no!

252
00:27:55,817 --> 00:27:57,292
Move... move!

253
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:03,319
Honey, are you okay?

254
00:28:04,554 --> 00:28:06,645
I feel like I am on fire.

255
00:28:07,545 --> 00:28:09,054
Look at me...

256
00:28:46,761 --> 00:28:47,990
You looked at it too.

257
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:52,803
How?

258
00:29:11,047 --> 00:29:12,475
Oh my God!

259
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:15,898
All those people.

260
00:29:24,084 --> 00:29:25,279
What do they want with them?

261
00:29:25,775 --> 00:29:27,297
I am not going to find out.

262
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:31,405
Got to get rid this.. I mean how? ..

263
00:29:32,194 --> 00:29:38,900
It set to take a life, perhaps our own.

264
00:29:40,766 --> 00:29:42,185
If it can trust you.

265
00:29:43,572 --> 00:29:46,512
Who wouldnt want to look at something so beautiful?

266
00:29:49,168 --> 00:29:50,639
It is kinda brilliant actually.

267
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,840
Enough of this shit.

268
00:29:54,631 --> 00:29:55,767
I got an idea.

269
00:29:56,033 --> 00:29:56,828
Where are you going?

270
00:29:57,228 --> 00:29:58,554
- Walt. - What for?
- Terry?

271
00:29:58,689 --> 00:30:01,279
- Don't worry about it. - Terry?
- Everything is under control.

272
00:30:31,327 --> 00:30:32,893
Are you okay?

273
00:30:33,482 --> 00:30:34,516
Yes, nothing.

274
00:30:34,842 --> 00:30:36,046
Let me see it.

275
00:30:36,442 --> 00:30:37,624
I said its nothing.

276
00:30:40,266 --> 00:30:43,981
- Alright.
- Fine.

277
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:08,484
Walt?

278
00:31:21,737 --> 00:31:23,583
Yo Walt?

279
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:26,230
Walt?

280
00:31:30,526 --> 00:31:31,547
Walt?

281
00:31:33,984 --> 00:31:35,081
Are you here?

282
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,958
What the hell are you doing?

283
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,485
Hiding.

284
00:32:00,449 --> 00:32:02,831
I saw the People in the sky.

285
00:32:03,703 --> 00:32:05,394
What they are Goddamn after?

286
00:32:05,973 --> 00:32:09,132
Come on, we're taking your car,
we are getting out of here. Lets go

287
00:32:09,174 --> 00:32:10,524
I am not going up there!

288
00:32:14,123 --> 00:32:15,080
Get down!

289
00:32:19,955 --> 00:32:22,435
Shhh .. Shut the dog.

290
00:32:59,966 --> 00:33:01,503
Shhhh...!

291
00:33:35,441 --> 00:33:37,139
No...
- no... no...

292
00:33:38,701 --> 00:33:40,408
Aarrgghh!

293
00:34:07,411 --> 00:34:08,101
Did you hear that?

294
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:14,381
Talk to me.

295
00:34:15,285 --> 00:34:16,892
I take my car and we getting out of here.

296
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,099
What happened?

297
00:34:18,248 --> 00:34:19,004
They took Walt.

298
00:34:19,492 --> 00:34:21,031
They taking Walt?
What are you talking about?

299
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:24,320
Whats the different. They came into the
the building and they just snatched him.

300
00:34:26,206 --> 00:34:27,319
Can we just go?

301
00:34:27,657 --> 00:34:28,394
Hold it

302
00:34:29,063 --> 00:34:30,864
Am I the only one who saw these photos?

303
00:34:32,098 --> 00:34:35,256
Its all happening right outside,
right now. They are everywhere

304
00:34:35,341 --> 00:34:36,575
They are not everywhere

305
00:34:37,888 --> 00:34:38,928
They are not over the wall

306
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:40,605
That's right.

307
00:34:40,651 --> 00:34:43,657
Yeah but it wont take them very long
to find who you live with.

308
00:34:44,177 --> 00:34:45,504
We can try there in 2 minutes.

309
00:34:45,527 --> 00:34:48,504
You have no idea whether they kepp him alive.

310
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:51,127
I know you are scared, alright,
We are all scared...

311
00:34:51,346 --> 00:34:54,197
But I am not burying my head in the sand.
Hoping it goes away.

312
00:34:54,294 --> 00:34:56,785
- I'm not saying that.
- Just take it easy man.

313
00:34:56,817 --> 00:34:59,832
- Its not easy.
- I know it is not.
- They are in the fucking building.

314
00:35:01,716 --> 00:35:02,982
Terry?

315
00:35:03,305 --> 00:35:04,371
It is the timer.

316
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,525
My God.

317
00:35:19,405 --> 00:35:21,978
Go go go

318
00:36:28,397 --> 00:36:29,770
You're disgusting!

319
00:36:30,459 --> 00:36:31,679
What the hell is the matter with you?

320
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:42,026
- We will talk about it later.
- Yes, we will talk about that.

321
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:55,466
I- Still want to stay?
I don't want any of this.

322
00:36:56,202 --> 00:37:00,048
They didn't see us
so we stay here and stay quiet..

323
00:37:00,348 --> 00:37:01,057
For how long?

324
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,778
Theyare taking people
out there, fine and simple.

325
00:37:04,506 --> 00:37:06,704
The further we get out of this city,
the better off we are.

326
00:37:08,073 --> 00:37:08,889
He is right.

327
00:37:09,907 --> 00:37:10,900
Jarrod.

328
00:37:11,051 --> 00:37:12,385
If we can get to the boat
we have a chance!

329
00:37:12,465 --> 00:37:13,067
- Yes, but we don't.

330
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:14,000
We have to...

331
00:37:18,857 --> 00:37:19,795
We have to try..

332
00:37:20,618 --> 00:37:23,778
We just get food and water.

333
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:25,947
Lets do this.

334
00:38:03,921 --> 00:38:05,015
Alright come on.

335
00:38:05,304 --> 00:38:08,415
Look, the sooner I get there,
the sooner the boat is ready to go.

336
00:38:08,739 --> 00:38:09,794
Be careful.

337
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,387
- Come on, lets go.
- What..

338
00:38:12,847 --> 00:38:13,642
What are you doing?

339
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:16,476
Driving, I know the way!
You just take your squat.

340
00:38:17,133 --> 00:38:17,865
Candice... Candice.

341
00:38:22,583 --> 00:38:23,477
Get in the car!

342
00:38:31,092 --> 00:38:32,335
Terry, sorry.

343
00:39:10,051 --> 00:39:11,842
- Hurry up.
- What do you think I am doing?

344
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:18,536
- They split up.
- No.

345
00:39:18,628 --> 00:39:19,895
Stop!

346
00:39:21,431 --> 00:39:22,632
Need help?

347
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,513
- No, go, we're fine.
- But, baby...

348
00:39:24,606 --> 00:39:26,797
Enough. Alright.
I said, we're fine.

349
00:39:59,602 --> 00:40:01,020
Terry!

350
00:40:07,752 --> 00:40:08,746
Terry..

351
00:40:26,663 --> 00:40:30,609
Jarrod!
Get back here now!

352
00:40:31,784 --> 00:40:33,137
Drive fast!

353
00:40:57,308 --> 00:41:00,646
- Open ..oh shit.
- Come on.

354
00:41:00,811 --> 00:41:02,658
Open.

355
00:41:07,527 --> 00:41:09,154
Open, you piece of shit

356
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:14,293
Back off! Back off! Back off!

357
00:41:38,752 --> 00:41:41,217
Oh my God! Help me.

358
00:41:42,277 --> 00:41:44,299
Someone help!

359
00:41:51,748 --> 00:41:53,492
The keys...
Give me the keys?

360
00:42:26,555 --> 00:42:27,627
You alright?

361
00:42:28,805 --> 00:42:30,355
Hmmm.

362
00:42:30,523 --> 00:42:31,574
My God!

363
00:42:33,094 --> 00:42:34,030
My God!

364
00:42:34,088 --> 00:42:35,687
- Miss you have to come..
- No.

365
00:42:37,653 --> 00:42:39,156
He's alive!

366
00:42:39,859 --> 00:42:40,924
Colin!

367
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:44,601
Help me!

368
00:43:01,947 --> 00:43:03,435
Come on, lets go!

369
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:13,418
Go! Go!

370
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,368
Make it to the back door.

371
00:43:41,347 --> 00:43:42,379
Run!

372
00:44:21,984 --> 00:44:23,144
Go!

373
00:44:37,164 --> 00:44:38,684
Dont stop!

374
00:44:40,627 --> 00:44:41,686
Open the door!

375
00:44:41,987 --> 00:44:43,261
Hurry!

376
00:44:50,207 --> 00:44:51,830
Back off. Open it!

377
00:45:02,678 --> 00:45:03,878
Where are we going?

378
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,297
All the way to the top is the safest
place, I can think of.

379
00:45:07,334 --> 00:45:09,251
It's not there?

380
00:45:10,822 --> 00:45:12,291
If you want to sit here
You can be my guest.

381
00:45:12,446 --> 00:45:13,772
Come on lets go

382
00:45:19,273 --> 00:45:20,962
Quickly... quickly ...quickly!

383
00:46:19,103 --> 00:46:21,706
Hey! Come help me with this.

384
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:41,446
It's better than nothing, right?

385
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:44,467
Yeah if you say so.

386
00:46:46,229 --> 00:46:47,479
What are you doing. Huh?

387
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,589
Like it or not, this is happening.

388
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:54,190
You got to be strong.

389
00:47:03,364 --> 00:47:04,916
Is everybody okay?

390
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:08,135
Are you hurt?

391
00:47:09,525 --> 00:47:11,652
No...
I'm okay.

392
00:47:21,552 --> 00:47:23,881
- What now?
- We stay here...

393
00:47:23,886 --> 00:47:26,605
We keep watch and we pray
that someone comes.

394
00:47:27,133 --> 00:47:28,056
He is right.

395
00:47:29,283 --> 00:47:30,395
Someone will come.

396
00:47:31,374 --> 00:47:33,313
I can't go on forever.

397
00:47:34,496 --> 00:47:35,628
Right?

398
00:47:44,176 --> 00:47:45,783
Sweety. It's best that we stay together.

399
00:47:46,044 --> 00:47:47,048
I can't.

400
00:47:47,442 --> 00:47:48,362
Smoke...

401
00:47:49,628 --> 00:47:53,000
Given such circumstances,
I think smoke is more than reasonable.

402
00:47:53,091 --> 00:47:54,041
Candice...

403
00:47:56,726 --> 00:47:59,049
I'm pregnant, alright!

404
00:48:00,312 --> 00:48:02,451
And I just thought that...

405
00:48:02,942 --> 00:48:04,895
...That with all this stress...

406
00:48:10,132 --> 00:48:11,586
Its okay.

407
00:48:16,502 --> 00:48:17,961
I got to tell my mom.

408
00:48:30,331 --> 00:48:33,878
Come on, boss. Lets the girls get some sleep.
You and I will keep watching.

409
00:48:36,074 --> 00:48:37,215
Both of us?

410
00:48:38,232 --> 00:48:41,520
They try that light stuff, we
got each others back.

411
00:49:03,798 --> 00:49:05,051
I hate L.A.

412
00:49:33,453 --> 00:49:35,415
I hadn't seen a soul all night.

413
00:49:39,415 --> 00:49:40,848
Perhaps the worst is over.

414
00:49:42,068 --> 00:49:43,107
Maybe not.

415
00:49:46,434 --> 00:49:48,086
What do you think these things really are?

416
00:49:49,164 --> 00:49:50,584
I do not know.

417
00:49:51,814 --> 00:49:53,202
Does it even matter?

418
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:00,613
It just doesn't seems real.

419
00:50:03,529 --> 00:50:05,504
Well, it is real.

420
00:50:06,284 --> 00:50:07,678
You better wake up.

421
00:50:10,138 --> 00:50:12,002
What's that supposed to mean?

422
00:50:12,213 --> 00:50:13,780
The city isn't blinking light

423
00:50:15,099 --> 00:50:16,746
We need to survive.

424
00:50:18,651 --> 00:50:20,771
There's not going to be many of us left.

425
00:50:41,164 --> 00:50:43,004
What do you see?

426
00:50:46,833 --> 00:50:48,470
Somebody is fighting back.

427
00:50:51,633 --> 00:50:52,569
What are you doing?

428
00:50:52,655 --> 00:50:53,730
I want to see what's out there.

429
00:51:07,221 --> 00:51:09,531
Turn that off, its too bright

430
00:51:09,631 --> 00:51:10,693
No!
We can risk it.

431
00:51:51,548 --> 00:51:54,550
SECOND DAY

432
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:09,916
Didn't you Sleep at all?

433
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,119
Is it getting worse?

434
00:52:18,513 --> 00:52:20,373
- What?
- Mark on your skin!

435
00:52:23,121 --> 00:52:25,927
When I looked in that light,
I couldn't stand for 10 minutes.

436
00:52:26,619 --> 00:52:28,428
Who knows what it did to us...

437
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,532
...to our bodies.

438
00:52:44,133 --> 00:52:48,682
You remember the first look when you saw it?
When it completely took over>

439
00:52:49,326 --> 00:52:51,677
Somehow you... you still felt...

440
00:52:56,572 --> 00:52:58,036
...powerful.

441
00:53:04,653 --> 00:53:05,703
I still do.

442
00:54:18,912 --> 00:54:21,767
Why don't you take a seat, relax?

443
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:39,177
Alright, I'll bite. What's your plan boss,
because I know you are dying to tell me.

444
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,022
Nothing to say?

445
00:54:44,574 --> 00:54:47,517
- We sitting near the marinna for Chrissake...
- I noticed that.

446
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,418
There are hundreds of boats
way across the street.

447
00:54:49,433 --> 00:54:50,938
We have been through all this.

448
00:54:51,553 --> 00:54:53,259
Remind us how that was done
the last time?

449
00:54:59,173 --> 00:55:00,973
We'll just go quietly this time.

450
00:55:01,396 --> 00:55:03,859
And search every boat
till we find the key?

451
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,391
- We have to..
- Well plan Jarrod.

452
00:55:07,472 --> 00:55:10,265
I can't believe you suggest that
after what happened.

453
00:55:11,147 --> 00:55:12,839
So that was my fault?

454
00:55:13,537 --> 00:55:18,104
I was practically begging,
but you wouldn't listen.

455
00:55:18,597 --> 00:55:21,475
And you think
Terry wouldn't listen me?

456
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:25,615
Alrightl...

457
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:30,327
Let's say we make it
out of the building.

458
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:32,732
Across the marina
down the dock

459
00:55:33,161 --> 00:55:35,488
We able to find a boat and
everything, then what?

460
00:55:36,863 --> 00:55:39,419
- Get the hell out of the dock.
- For who?

461
00:55:39,513 --> 00:55:40,587
Carolina, down the coast?

462
00:55:40,685 --> 00:55:43,282
- Anywhere will be better than here!
- How do you know?

463
00:55:44,253 --> 00:55:45,150
We are here.

464
00:55:46,546 --> 00:55:47,729
We are alive.

465
00:55:49,784 --> 00:55:50,740
What was that?

466
00:55:53,718 --> 00:55:54,526
What do you see?

467
00:56:01,506 --> 00:56:02,724
Hallelujah.

468
00:57:14,185 --> 00:57:16,492
Come on... come on... come on.

469
00:57:34,136 --> 00:57:35,385
Everybody get down!

470
00:58:00,285 --> 00:58:01,515
Elaine?

471
00:59:01,885 --> 00:59:03,020
It worked.

472
00:59:09,315 --> 00:59:10,566
I hope we whipped it.

473
00:59:13,832 --> 00:59:17,559
- Do you mind?
- By all means.

474
00:59:26,026 --> 00:59:31,880
- Do you think more planes will come?
- Yes, now they know what to do.

475
00:59:45,745 --> 00:59:46,597
What?

476
00:59:48,097 --> 00:59:49,686
What is it?

477
00:59:49,784 --> 00:59:50,918
They are not dead.

478
00:59:51,918 --> 00:59:55,916
They are just really,
really pissed off.

479
01:00:20,175 --> 01:00:21,517
Something is happening.

480
01:00:34,654 --> 01:00:36,902
We have to close all these windows.

481
01:00:38,281 --> 01:00:40,078
Come help me with this.

482
01:00:40,482 --> 01:00:41,693
Get back over here!

483
01:00:42,412 --> 01:00:43,764
I will find something.

484
01:00:49,717 --> 01:00:50,813
Here.

485
01:00:57,703 --> 01:00:59,441
Jarrod, what are you doing?

486
01:01:00,633 --> 01:01:02,296
They'll get to you too.

487
01:01:09,601 --> 01:01:11,294
Whats these really about huh?

488
01:01:12,631 --> 01:01:14,099
Those things are coming for us.

489
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:17,930
You think I haven't noticed that mess
under your shirt?

490
01:01:19,289 --> 01:01:22,041
We stay here and hole up... for good.

491
01:01:23,407 --> 01:01:24,419
I agreed.

492
01:01:25,558 --> 01:01:28,704
And I guess that decide everythig,
we have no water.

493
01:01:29,397 --> 01:01:31,827
- No power..
- Yes, but you saw what's out there.

494
01:01:32,166 --> 01:01:35,717
Yeah... but I'd rather make a run for it,
then stay at a 20 storey target.

495
01:01:36,254 --> 01:01:39,644
Between those

496
01:01:51,746 --> 01:01:54,945
Go..go..go make a stand.

497
01:01:56,163 --> 01:01:57,958
- Let go off me!
- What the hell do you think you're doing?

498
01:01:58,046 --> 01:02:00,829
- You want to wait here.
- We'll let everything go!

499
01:02:00,914 --> 01:02:03,374
I m saying lets call for help. The helpers here.

500
01:02:04,835 --> 01:02:06,634
They got the rescue chopper! Don't you get it?
We are at war.

501
01:02:11,178 --> 01:02:12,265
Where are you going?

502
01:02:18,213 --> 01:02:21,141
Those chopper will be coming back for them,
We have to go.

503
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:22,681
Come on.

504
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:30,185
We'll go the roof. They'll pick us up.

505
01:02:30,473 --> 01:02:31,489
What if they don't come back?

506
01:02:31,533 --> 01:02:34,173
- Look at what they did to those planes.
- We good are the Helicopter.

507
01:02:34,448 --> 01:02:36,184
-,We have to take a chance.
- A chance?

508
01:02:37,191 --> 01:02:40,006
They just nooke the city,
and you run away for

509
01:02:40,141 --> 01:02:43,219
You just you need to back off. We have to..

510
01:02:43,758 --> 01:02:44,880
Oh shit.

511
01:02:46,283 --> 01:02:47,416
You just going to stand there?

512
01:02:47,498 --> 01:02:51,152
What happen when the rest of the
block falls?

513
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:55,205
- Come on.
- How can you be so sure?

514
01:02:55,697 --> 01:02:56,752
Just go!

515
01:02:57,209 --> 01:02:59,240
You're in no condition to
decide anything.

516
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:00,912
Who knows what side you're on.

517
01:03:01,793 --> 01:03:03,032
I warn you.

518
01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:05,299
Stop!
Both of you!

01:03:06,381 --> 01:03:07,667
Look at his face.

520
01:03:08,591 --> 01:03:09,680
He's sick.

521
01:03:11,877 --> 01:03:14,204
- Do not make me hurt you.
- Oh don't worry.

522
01:03:24,903 --> 01:03:27,585
I'm not leaving without my family.

523
01:03:29,161 --> 01:03:33,116
And there's nothing you can do to stop us.

524
01:03:35,669 --> 01:03:37,071
