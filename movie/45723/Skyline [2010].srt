1
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,513
Is it morning already?

2
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:24,269
Jarrod...

3
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,108
Jarrod, wake up.

4
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,070
It's okay.

5
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:45,958
What is that?

6
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,085
I don't know.

7
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:53,131
Ray!

8
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,388
Stay here.

9
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:02,850
What's wrong?

10
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,184
He's gone!

11
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,951
Jarrod!
Jarrod!

12
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,083
Come here.

13
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,379
Jarrod.

14
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,165
I can't decide.

15
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,210
Elaine, you pick the last one.

16
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,722
Jay-rock... T-money...

17
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:28,435
Oh, we were... to ahead of our time,
we were bad.

18
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,146
You haven't changed a bit.

19
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,191
Neither has Terry...

20
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,235
You'll see.

21
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:37,819
He's a real deal.

22
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:39,321
Can't wait.

23
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:10,644
Edward you should thought about that
before you shot that piece of shit.

24
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:13,939
What you doing here so early?

25
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:17,276
- It's a beautiful day.
- Don't I know it.

26
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,444
Barry called in about the robot...

27
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,696
Tell him, handle it...

28
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:22,698
no business on my birthday.

29
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,913
- Babe.
- God, she always has to be here?

30
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,582
She's working.

31
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,585
Hmm.
You're sweaty.

32
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,694
- Okay? Are you alright
- Yeah.

33
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,197
Yeah, I'm fine.

34
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,247
Here, let me get that for you.
Here you go.

35
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:13,582
- Thank you.
- No Problem.

36
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,543
That's my hero.

37
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,845
"J" - Rock.

38
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,891
Yeah, that... that's us.

39
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,022
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

40
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:39,316
You better not get used to this.

41
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:41,443
Who? Me?

42
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:17,771
Penthouse.

43
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,943
Alright. Come on.

44
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,864
How the second most talented
guy I know?

45
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,490
I don't know, how are you?

46
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:29,825
I'm good.

47
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,161
Happy Birthday!

48
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:35,622
Oh... You must be Elaine?

49
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:36,748
- Yeah,
- Welcome.

50
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,169
This is amazing.

51
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:42,379
Automatic even at its finest.

52
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,465
My own personal place
in the clouds.

53
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,718
The view is incredible.

54
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,220
Let me ask you a question.

55
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,890
You keeping my boy in line?

56
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,392
Don't answer that... hey!

57
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,603
It's a full time job.

58
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,939
Whatever he is paying
you, I'll double it.

59
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,984
Oh, well, looks like,
you got your hands full already.

60
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:05,903
I like that.
Yeah.

61
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,863
That's your room right here.

62
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,489
You guys wanna hit the pool?

63
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:11,909
Absolutely.

64
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,118
Babe!

65
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,913
Pool Time!

66
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,589
- Baby, get me a cosmo.
- Absolutely, hold this.

67
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,591
Hey, the bar's this way.

68
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,639
- You really did it, man.
- Yeah.

69
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,432
I mean just like everybody knew
you would, but...

70
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:36,517
Hey, guys.

71
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,435
Hello...

72
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,604
I wouldn't have done
without you.

73
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:42,814
What I do?
Decorate the walls?

74
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,984
- You do look nice.
- And you do look nice.

75
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,611
Happy Birthday, Terry.

76
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,156
Yeah, happy birthday to me.

77
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:57,871
And I do not know what to give
you as a gift.

78
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:00,916
I got some ideas on that.

79
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,459
Come on.

80
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:08,257
I see everyone getting along famously.

81
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,343
- Baby?
- Yeah?

82
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:13,095
Where is my cosmo?

83
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:16,139
Owh, my bad.

84
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,016
Denise, get me a drink.

85
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,561
- Anyone else?
- No.

86
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,609
Well, this definitely
beats Brooklyn in December.

87
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,778
I don't know, I kinda like
our four Seasons.

88
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,864
We got one of those,
down the block.

89
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:37,077
Tomorrow we're gonna hit the high sea,
I'm gonna take you all out on my Sunseeker.

90
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:42,040
It's a 67 footer.
My ****...

91
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:50,007
That's Homeland Security.

92
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:54,011
They must be here because they know
tonights party is gonna be a "bomb".

93
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:58,640
Cheers.

94
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:02,561
Happy Birthday, Terry!

95
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:06,648
- Oh hi, dude. How's it going man?
- I'm alright.

96
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,279
There's somebody I want you to meet.
Ray!

97
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:13,697
Hold on.

98
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:19,578
Well, birthday boy, happy Birthday, man.
- Thank you.

99
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:21,371
How's the "robot fight" coming along?

100
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:25,751
Dude, it's sucks, but the director
loves it, so... you know.

101
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,754
- Hey, is this the boy wonder?
- Yeah.

102
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:32,633
- And his lovely lady, yeah-ha-ha.
- Hey.

103
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,551
- Hey, good to meet you, man.
- Yeah.

104
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,678
Listen, I'm psyched
you're gonna join the crew.

105
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:39,431
Huh?... I mean, I...

106
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:40,933
Hey, hey,
did you find a place to live yet?

107
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,101
I'm telling you,
Venice, it's where it's at.

108
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,229
- I live there, so...
- We have a place, thank you.

109
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:46,605
Sure you have.

110
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:49,608
- I have to go to the little girl's room.
- Alright.

111
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:50,859
- Excuse me.
- No...

112
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,028
Babe... Elaine!

113
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,490
She's smokin', nice job dude.

114
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:59,368
- Wait up for me. Let's go.
- What's he talking about?

115
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:01,078
What's going on, ladies?

116
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:03,956
- Sorry.
- What was that all about?

117
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:06,291
Hey, look.

118
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,502
The cat's obviously outta the bag...

119
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:11,839
I was thinking...

120
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,299
you should move to L.A.

121
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:19,388
What am I gonna do out here?
I mean... I rather survive back home.

122
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:20,973
I could use you.

123
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,267
Oh, I don't need any charity,
alright?

124
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,518
Okay fine.

125
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,144
I need you.

126
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:29,147
I don't know anything about effects, man.

127
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,650
- That's bullshit, come on.
- That's not bullshit.

128
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:35,821
You got the eye and you know it.
Alright... Computer is just a tool.

129
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:41,702
I... I don't know, okay?
I never saw myself out here.

130
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,162
Where do you see yourself?

131
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:49,168
- You got five year plan I don't know about?
- It's not about the money, okay?

132
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,170
It's always about the money.

133
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:56,675
What about Elaine?

134
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,764
I can't handle everything.
You gotta take care of that yourself.

135
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:05,184
Terry, there's a call for you upstairs.

136
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:07,311
You think about it.

137
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,828
Elaine.

138
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,753
Come on.

139
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:36,215
We are supposed to be having fun,
what is the problem?

140
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,717
Just forget it, alright?

141
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:41,178
Look...

142
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:44,848
Terry sprung this whole California thing
on me today, alright?

143
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,975
- I had no idea, I didn't...
- I'm late.

144
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:49,853
What you mean, late?

145
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:52,022
Late...

146
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:57,819
Oh, excuse me...
Sorry.

147
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:05,577
Since when?

148
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:06,662
I don't know.

149
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:11,041
I've been feeling sick all week,
so I took a test and...

150
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:13,961
Why didn't you tell me?

151
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:20,467
I wanted to... Believe me, I just...
I didn't wanna ruin your trip.

152
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:27,891
Shit.

153
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:29,977
Is that all you have to say?

154
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:31,979
What do you want me to say?

155
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:38,110
- I don't think I'm ready for this.
- You're not ready, Jarrod?

156
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,194
What about me?

157
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:42,239
It's not...
hey, will you keep...

158
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,418
Is that what we have
to look forward too.

159
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:00,465
Leni...

160
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,605
Hey man, we got... we got...
we got a lot... lot more.

161
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:24,406
Oh, my God.

162
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:28,493
Go... go... go...
go... go...

163
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,623
Oh, my God, man!

164
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:48,931
Pardon me ma'am,
but...

165
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,183
we received a few
noise complaints.

166
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,601
From whom?

167
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:54,520
The building's half empty.

168
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:58,232
I understand that, but...
the other half is trying to sleep.

169
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:00,609
- So, if you don't mind if you just...
- Alright.

170
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,459
Another one for the books.

171
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:25,217
- Well... well... well
- I got the couch.

172
00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:27,761
Oh, come on, I think
there's space for both of us?

173
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:31,014
- I like space.
- Whoa, alright.

174
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:33,308
Beggers can't be chooser.

175
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:45,779
Good night.

176
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:09,029
Earthquake!

177
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,907
You're probably just dreaming.

178
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:57,160
Put out the lights.

179
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:12,926
Ray...
What're you doing?

180
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:32,779
Ray!

181
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,246
Stay here.

182
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:45,626
- What's wrong?
- He's gone.

183
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:57,679
Jarrod, no.

184
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:03,727
- No, Jarrod, no.
- Jarrod... no.

185
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:05,062
What's going on, man?

186
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:07,231
Jarrod, please stop.

187
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:11,860
What's with you, man?

188
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:14,571
Jarrod?

189
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:17,157
Oh, my God, Jarrod.

190
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,034
Jarrod!

191
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:21,662
Please..
He tooked something?

192
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:26,542
- Jarrod..
- Oh God.

193
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:27,960
Jarrod...

194
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:33,757
What's wrong with him?

195
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:38,053
Jarrod? Oh my God.

196
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:42,516
- Where's Ray? Where's Ray?
- No, no, no, no...

197
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,434
- Jarrod.
- Where is he?

198
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:45,727
- He's gone!
- What do you mean he's gone?

199
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:47,396
- I mean, he's gone!
- Did he fall?

200
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:48,355
- No.
- Did he jump?

201
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:49,731
No! I don't...

202
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:56,321
He went outside...
to the light.

203
00:19:58,115 --> 00:20:00,784
And then he...
he just disappeared.

204
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:02,995
xxx

205
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:07,708
Terry...

206
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,251
Terry, please!

207
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:34,234
What did you see?
What did you see?

208
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,654
Talk to me.

209
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,083
Jarrod, what happened?

210
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:54,046
I don't know.

211
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:03,430
I was being pulled...
towards this light.

212
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,443
- Open the blinds.
- No...

213
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:18,904
- Open the blinds!
- No!

214
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:20,739
Goddamn it...

215
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:33,627
There's something down there.

216
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,212
What?

217
00:21:35,546 --> 00:21:36,713
Jarrod, check this out.

218
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:51,895
I don't see anything.

219
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,276
- There are people on roof.
- What are they doing?

220
00:21:58,485 --> 00:21:59,570
I don't know.

221
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:03,907
We should check it out.

222
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:06,285
You don't know what's out there.

223
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,875
- I'll be okay.
- Alright.

224
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,668
I'm calling the police.

225
00:22:18,172 --> 00:22:20,507
- I'll try to take some pictures.
- You can't go out there.

226
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:24,344
I'm not going out there alone.

227
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:26,013
It just keeps ringing.

228
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:33,270
A gun?

229
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:34,771
Really?

230
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:38,025
Just check the news and find out
what the hell's going on.

231
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:40,319
- Terry..
- We'll be right back.

232
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:44,072
- Jarrod.
- Look at me.

233
00:22:53,749 --> 00:22:54,917
Let's go.

234
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,877
Hurry back.

235
00:23:25,531 --> 00:23:27,241
The stairs are this way.

236
00:23:56,979 --> 00:23:58,397
What's going on?

237
00:23:58,772 --> 00:23:59,773
I'm going to check it out.

238
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:01,692
What're you doing with the gun?

239
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,695
Get back in your apartment.
Go!

240
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:07,406
And keep it down.

241
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:18,709
Hey...
you sure about this?

242
00:24:21,003 --> 00:24:22,254
Yeah.

243
00:24:29,303 --> 00:24:31,972
There's been nothing new
since 4 am.

244
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:35,559
Denise, check the TV.

245
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:06,965
It's calm.

246
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:13,805
Damn it, Jarrod.

247
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:15,724
You didn't tell me to
hold it open.

248
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:18,352
I thought it was common sense.

249
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,021
I'm sorry.

250
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:24,816
Get down.

251
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:31,156
What now?

252
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:34,701
Let's get a better look.

253
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:45,045
Hi, this is Jackie.
Please leave a message.

254
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:47,881
Mom, it's me.

255
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:53,220
Something happened and...
pick up.

256
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:59,059
Please, just...
call me back as soon as you get this.

257
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:00,579
Holy shit.

258
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:35,781
- I can't see it.
- Is that what I think it is?

259
00:27:40,994 --> 00:27:42,162
My God.

260
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:19,825
- Let's go.
- What is it?

261
00:28:20,993 --> 00:28:22,411
Run!
Let's go.

262
00:28:22,411 --> 00:28:23,453
Go!

263
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,793
Come on, pull!

264
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:31,295
Back up!
Back up!

265
00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:35,674
Come on!

266
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:48,520
Come on!

267
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:54,985
Elaine, no!

268
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:08,749
Move... move!

269
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:15,255
Honey, are you okay?

270
00:29:16,548 --> 00:29:18,300
I feel like I'm on fire.

271
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,261
Look at me...

272
00:30:00,342 --> 00:30:01,635
Yeah, look at you.

273
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:06,640
How?

274
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,869
Oh, my God!

275
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,831
All those people.

276
00:30:39,256 --> 00:30:40,632
What they want with them?

277
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:43,135
I'm not gonna go find out.

278
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:47,639
God, can't believe this...
I mean how?...

279
00:30:48,348 --> 00:30:50,142
Once you look at the light...

280
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:57,232
It grabs hold.
It's like that...

281
00:30:57,274 --> 00:30:58,859
It can trust you.

282
00:30:59,693 --> 00:31:02,863
I mean, who wouldn't wanna look
at something so beautiful?

283
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:07,159
It's kinda brilliant, actually.

284
00:31:08,118 --> 00:31:09,870
Enough of this shit.

285
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:12,206
I got an idea.

286
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:13,832
Where you going?

287
00:31:13,832 --> 00:31:15,417
- Walt's. - Terry?
- What for?

288
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:16,376
Don't worry about it.

289
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:18,253
- Terry?
- Everything's under control.

290
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:50,410
Are you okay?

291
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:53,038
Yeah, it's nothing.

292
00:31:53,455 --> 00:31:54,706
Let me see.

293
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:56,375
I said its nothin'.

294
00:31:58,919 --> 00:31:59,878
Alright.

295
00:32:01,338 --> 00:32:02,589
Alright?

296
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:28,115
Walt?

297
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:44,506
Yo... Walt?

298
00:32:46,091 --> 00:32:47,050
Walt?

299
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:52,181
Walt?

300
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,851
Are you in here?

301
00:33:18,248 --> 00:33:19,708
What the hell you doing?

302
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,335
Hiding.

303
00:33:22,544 --> 00:33:25,214
I saw the people in the sky...

304
00:33:25,714 --> 00:33:27,883
like the Goddamn ***

305
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:31,803
Come on, we're taking your car,
we're getting the hell outta here. Lets go!

306
00:33:31,845 --> 00:33:32,930
I'm not going out there!

307
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:37,684
Get down!

308
00:33:42,648 --> 00:33:45,234
- Shhh..
- Shut the dog up, shut the dog up!

309
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:25,983
Shhh!...

310
00:35:01,393 --> 00:35:03,145
- Oh, God no...
- No... no...

311
00:35:03,145 --> 00:35:04,271
Walt!

312
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:06,565
Aarrgghh!

313
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:35,761
Did you hear that?

314
00:35:41,058 --> 00:35:41,975
Talk to me.

315
00:35:43,352 --> 00:35:44,978
We need to get my boat
and gettin' outta here.

316
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:45,979
What happened?

317
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:47,022
They took Walt.

318
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:49,024
They took Walt?
What're you talking about?

319
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:52,444
This one was different. They came in the
building and they just snatched him.

320
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:55,447
Then we just go.

321
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:57,115
Hold on a sec.

322
00:35:57,282 --> 00:35:59,493
Am I the only one
who saw these photos?

323
00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:03,830
It's all happening right outside,
right now. They're everywhere...

324
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,749
But they're not everywhere.
They're...

325
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,793
they're not over the water.

326
00:36:08,126 --> 00:36:09,336
He's right.

327
00:36:09,378 --> 00:36:12,506
Yeah, well, it didn't take 'em very long
to find who you live with.

328
00:36:13,048 --> 00:36:14,967
We can drive there in 2 minutes.

329
00:36:14,967 --> 00:36:17,553
You have no idea
whether they keep them alive.

330
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:20,597
Ellie, I know you are scared, okay?
We're all scared...

331
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:23,475
But I'm not burying my head in the sand,
hoping it goes away.

332
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,186
- I'm not saying that.
- Look, just take it easy, man.

333
00:36:26,228 --> 00:36:28,105
- It's not easy with all this...
- I know it's not.

334
00:36:28,105 --> 00:36:29,898
They're in the fucking building.

335
00:36:31,316 --> 00:36:32,651
Terry?

336
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:34,111
It's the timer.

337
00:36:35,654 --> 00:36:37,406
My God.

338
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:51,628
Go... go... move...
move!

339
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:03,367
You're disgusting!

340
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:05,369
What the hell's the matter with you?

341
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:15,921
- We'll talk about that later.
- Yeah, we will talk about that.

342
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:30,269
- You still wanna stay?
- I don't want... any of this.

343
00:38:30,727 --> 00:38:34,815
They didn't see us
so we stay here and stay quiet.

344
00:38:35,023 --> 00:38:36,108
For how long?

345
00:38:36,191 --> 00:38:38,610
They're taking people
out there, plane and simple.

346
00:38:39,361 --> 00:38:42,197
The further we get outta the city,
the better off we are.

347
00:38:43,115 --> 00:38:44,032
He's right.

348
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,034
Jarrod.

349
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:47,786
If we get to the boat
we have a chance!

350
00:38:47,786 --> 00:38:49,746
- Yeah, but if we don't...
- We have...

351
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:55,335
We have to try.

352
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:59,882
We just, uh...
get food and water.

353
00:39:00,883 --> 00:39:01,925
Let's do this.

354
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:42,674
Alright, come on.

355
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:46,428
Look, the sooner I get there,
the sooner the boat's ready to go.

356
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,471
Be careful.

357
00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:50,474
- Come on, let's go.
- What..

358
00:39:50,516 --> 00:39:51,475
What you doing?

359
00:39:51,517 --> 00:39:55,145
Driving, I know the way!
You just take your slut.

360
00:39:55,229 --> 00:39:56,188
Candice...

361
00:39:57,231 --> 00:39:58,273
Candice.

362
00:40:00,776 --> 00:40:01,944
Get in the car!

363
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,286
Terry, I'm sorry.

364
00:40:50,284 --> 00:40:52,244
- Hurry up.
- What do you think I'm doing?

365
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,251
- Hey, slow down.
- No.

366
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:00,544
Just stop!

367
00:41:02,171 --> 00:41:03,422
You need any help?

368
00:41:03,422 --> 00:41:05,591
- No, go, we're fine.
- Yeah but, maybe...

369
00:41:05,674 --> 00:41:08,051
Enough, alright?
I said, we're fine.

370
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,046
Terry, get up!
Run!

371
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:45,297
Come on.

372
00:41:50,052 --> 00:41:51,803
Hey, Terry...
Terry!

373
00:42:10,155 --> 00:42:13,450
Jarrod!
Get your ass back here now!

374
00:42:15,744 --> 00:42:17,120
Back up!

375
00:42:33,804 --> 00:42:34,930
Come on.

376
00:42:42,145 --> 00:42:45,607
- Open! Oh shit.
- Come on.

377
00:42:45,691 --> 00:42:46,859
Open!

378
00:42:47,484 --> 00:42:48,443
Come on.

379
00:42:52,698 --> 00:42:54,491
Open, you piece of shit!

380
00:42:57,786 --> 00:42:59,830
Back up! Back up! Back up!

381
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:27,900
Oh, my God.
Help me!

382
00:43:29,026 --> 00:43:31,236
Someone help!

383
00:43:38,493 --> 00:43:40,913
- We gotta get outta here.
- Give me the keys.

384
00:44:15,197 --> 00:44:16,323
You alright?

385
00:44:17,241 --> 00:44:18,617
He's fine.

386
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:20,410
Oh, my God.

387
00:44:21,995 --> 00:44:22,996
Oh, my God!

388
00:44:23,038 --> 00:44:24,706
- Miss, we have to go...
- No.

389
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,335
He's alive!

390
00:44:29,086 --> 00:44:30,170
Colin!

391
00:44:32,506 --> 00:44:34,007
Help me!

392
00:44:52,109 --> 00:44:53,652
Come on, let's go!

393
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:04,079
Go! Go!

394
00:45:21,013 --> 00:45:22,764
Make it to the back door.

395
00:45:33,192 --> 00:45:34,276
Run!

396
00:46:15,567 --> 00:46:16,777
Go!

397
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:32,960
Don't stop!

398
00:46:35,003 --> 00:46:36,088
Open the door!

399
00:46:36,296 --> 00:46:37,756
Hurry!

400
00:46:44,263 --> 00:46:45,931
- Get it open.
- Back up.

401
00:46:45,931 --> 00:46:46,890
Open it.

402
00:46:57,985 --> 00:46:59,236
Where we going?

403
00:47:00,279 --> 00:47:02,698
All the way to the top is the safest
place I can think of.

404
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:04,825
What if they're up there?

405
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:07,995
If you wanna stay out here
with them, be my guest.

406
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:10,080
Come on, let's go.

407
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:17,171
Come on, quickly... quickly...
quickly!

408
00:48:17,689 --> 00:48:20,692
Hey!...
Come help me with this.

409
00:48:39,211 --> 00:48:41,088
It's better than nothing, right?

410
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:44,216
Yeah, if you say so.

411
00:48:45,968 --> 00:48:47,261
What're you doing, huh?

412
00:48:47,427 --> 00:48:49,471
Like it or not,
this is happening.

413
00:48:52,808 --> 00:48:54,268
You gotta be strong.

414
00:49:03,735 --> 00:49:05,237
Is everybody okay?

415
00:49:07,948 --> 00:49:09,032
Are you hurt?

416
00:49:10,242 --> 00:49:12,703
No...
I'm okay.

417
00:49:22,796 --> 00:49:25,215
- What now?
- We stay here...

418
00:49:25,215 --> 00:49:28,594
We keep watch and we pray
that someone comes.

419
00:49:28,635 --> 00:49:29,803
He's right.

420
00:49:30,971 --> 00:49:32,014
Someone's gonna come.

421
00:49:33,056 --> 00:49:35,058
This can't go on forever.

422
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:37,477
Right?

423
00:49:45,986 --> 00:49:48,322
Sweety, it's best
if we stay together.

424
00:49:48,322 --> 00:49:49,406
I can't...

425
00:49:49,781 --> 00:49:50,866
the smoke.

426
00:49:52,075 --> 00:49:55,579
Given such circumstances, I think
a smoke is more than reasonable.

427
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:56,663
Candice...

428
00:49:59,917 --> 00:50:01,585
I'm pregnant, alright?

429
00:50:03,212 --> 00:50:05,130
And I just thought that...

430
00:50:06,048 --> 00:50:08,008
that with all this stress...

431
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,973
It's okay.

432
00:50:19,895 --> 00:50:21,730
Jarrod, I got to tell my mom.

433
00:50:34,535 --> 00:50:35,494
Come on, boss.

434
00:50:35,494 --> 00:50:38,622
Let's let the girls get some sleep.
You and I will keep watch now.

435
00:50:40,624 --> 00:50:41,792
Both of us?

436
00:50:42,751 --> 00:50:46,296
They try that light stuff,
we got each others back.

437
00:51:09,319 --> 00:51:10,737
I hate L.A.

438
00:51:40,434 --> 00:51:42,477
I haven't seen a soul all night.

439
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,066
Maybe the worst is over.

440
00:51:49,318 --> 00:51:50,402
Maybe not.

441
00:51:53,864 --> 00:51:55,616
What do you think
these things really are?

442
00:51:56,742 --> 00:51:57,993
I don't know.

443
00:51:59,494 --> 00:52:00,954
Does it even matter?

444
00:52:06,543 --> 00:52:08,253
It just doesn't seem real.

445
00:52:11,715 --> 00:52:13,759
Well, it is real.

446
00:52:14,593 --> 00:52:16,011
You better wake up.

447
00:52:18,597 --> 00:52:20,557
What's that supposed to mean?

448
00:52:20,766 --> 00:52:22,726
The city is a vacant lot.

449
00:52:23,769 --> 00:52:25,604
We need to survive.

450
00:52:27,773 --> 00:52:29,691
There's not gonna be many of us left.

451
00:52:51,588 --> 00:52:53,173
What do you see?

452
00:52:56,844 --> 00:52:58,554
Somebody is fighting back.

453
00:53:01,849 --> 00:53:04,101
- What're you doing?
- I wanna see what's out there.

454
00:53:18,115 --> 00:53:20,534
Turn that off,
its too bright.

455
00:53:20,617 --> 00:53:22,244
- No!
- We can't risk it.

456
00:54:22,054 --> 00:54:23,597
Did you sleep at all?

457
00:54:29,311 --> 00:54:31,021
Is it getting worse?

458
00:54:32,439 --> 00:54:34,483
- What?
- The marks on your skin.

459
00:54:37,277 --> 00:54:40,197
When I looked into that light,
I couldn't stand for 10 minutes.

460
00:54:40,906 --> 00:54:42,908
Who knows what it did to us...

461
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,456
to our bodies.

462
00:54:59,174 --> 00:55:01,844
You remember the first moment
when you saw it?

463
00:55:01,844 --> 00:55:03,929
When it completely took over?

464
00:55:05,097 --> 00:55:07,140
Somehow you...
you still felt...

465
00:55:12,437 --> 00:55:13,689
powerful.

466
00:55:20,487 --> 00:55:21,655
I still do.

467
00:56:38,023 --> 00:56:40,984
Why don't you take a seat...
relax.

468
00:56:52,621 --> 00:56:59,127
Alright, I'll bite. What's your plan boss,
'cause I know you're dying to tell me.

469
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:03,257
Nothing to say?

470
00:57:04,758 --> 00:57:06,677
We're sitting on a marina
for Chirst sakes...

471
00:57:06,677 --> 00:57:07,719
I've noticed that.

472
00:57:08,011 --> 00:57:10,013
There are hundreds of boats
right across the street.

473
00:57:10,055 --> 00:57:11,598
We've been through all this.

474
00:57:12,057 --> 00:57:13,934
Remind us how that was done
last time?

475
00:57:19,982 --> 00:57:21,859
We... we go quietly this time.

476
00:57:22,317 --> 00:57:24,862
And search every boat
'till we find a key?

477
00:57:25,028 --> 00:57:27,823
- If we have to...
- Great plan, Jarrod.

478
00:57:28,657 --> 00:57:31,743
I can't believe you even suggest that,
after what happened.

479
00:57:32,452 --> 00:57:34,454
Are you saying it was my fault?

480
00:57:34,955 --> 00:57:39,835
I was practically begging,
but you wouldn't listen.

481
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:43,338
And you think
that Terry wouldn't listen me?

482
00:57:46,258 --> 00:57:47,551
Alright...

483
00:57:49,845 --> 00:57:52,472
Let's say we make it
outta the building.

484
00:57:52,931 --> 00:57:54,975
Across the marina
down the dock.

485
00:57:55,434 --> 00:57:57,853
We even find a boat and
everything, then what?

486
00:57:59,271 --> 00:58:01,940
- We get the hell outta Dodge.
- Where to?

487
00:58:02,065 --> 00:58:03,483
Carolina, down the coast?

488
00:58:03,483 --> 00:58:06,278
- Anywhere is better than here!
- How do you know?

489
00:58:06,987 --> 00:58:07,946
We're here.

490
00:58:09,406 --> 00:58:10,616
We're alive.

491
00:58:12,743 --> 00:58:13,744
What was that?

492
00:58:16,872 --> 00:58:17,915
What do you see?

493
00:58:25,297 --> 00:58:26,340
Hallelujah.

494
00:59:41,081 --> 00:59:43,292
Come on... come on...
come on!

495
01:00:01,476 --> 01:00:02,895
Everybody get down!

496
01:00:29,046 --> 01:00:30,214
Leni?

497
01:01:32,985 --> 01:01:34,278
It worked.

498
01:01:40,701 --> 01:01:43,704
- I don't believe it.
- Is it over?

499
01:01:45,622 --> 01:01:49,418
- Do you mind?
- By all means, boss.

500
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:00,804
Do you think there're more planes
where they came from?

501
01:02:01,221 --> 01:02:06,852
Yes, now they know what to do.
They'll be sending help in no time.

502
01:02:18,822 --> 01:02:19,823
What?

503
01:02:21,491 --> 01:02:22,701
What is it?

504
01:02:23,035 --> 01:02:24,203
They're not dead.

505
01:02:25,245 --> 01:02:29,208
They're just really...
really pissed off.

506
01:02:54,816 --> 01:02:56,235
Something is happening.

507
01:03:10,123 --> 01:03:12,167
We have to cover
these windows.

508
01:03:13,585 --> 01:03:15,045
Come help me with this.

509
01:03:15,879 --> 01:03:17,130
Get back over here!

510
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:19,299
I'll find something.

511
01:03:25,514 --> 01:03:26,640
Here.

512
01:03:33,856 --> 01:03:35,649
Jarrod, what are you doing?

513
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,652
They'll be coming here.

514
01:03:46,243 --> 01:03:48,245
What's this really about, huh?

515
01:03:49,413 --> 01:03:51,164
Those things are coming for us.

516
01:03:52,666 --> 01:03:54,918
You think I haven't noticed that mess
under your shirt?

517
01:03:56,336 --> 01:03:59,339
We stay here and hold up...
for good.

518
01:04:00,632 --> 01:04:01,717
I agree.

519
01:04:02,885 --> 01:04:06,263
Well, I guess that said everything,
we have no water.

520
01:04:06,889 --> 01:04:09,433
- No power..
- Yeah, but you saw what's out there.

521
01:04:09,766 --> 01:04:13,896
Yeah, but I would rather make a run for it,
then stay in a 20 story target.

522
01:04:14,062 --> 01:04:17,900
Between those things and the radiaton,
we are dead up here.

523
01:04:30,204 --> 01:04:33,540
Go... go... go... go,
let's make a stand.

524
01:04:35,125 --> 01:04:37,711
- Let go off me!
- What the hell do you think you're doing?

525
01:04:37,794 --> 01:04:39,671
- You want to wait here.
- We'll let everything go!

526
01:04:39,963 --> 01:04:42,633
I'm saying we call for help.
The help is here.

527
01:04:43,842 --> 01:04:45,719
Does that look like
a rescue chopper to you?

528
01:04:45,719 --> 01:04:48,222
Don't you get it?
We're at war.

529
01:04:50,474 --> 01:04:51,808
Where are they going?

530
01:04:57,814 --> 01:05:00,859
Those choppers are coming back for them.
We have to go.

531
01:05:01,443 --> 01:05:02,444
Come on.

532
01:05:08,492 --> 01:05:10,494
We get to the roof.
They'll pick us up.

533
01:05:10,494 --> 01:05:11,620
What if they don't come back?

534
01:05:11,703 --> 01:05:14,957
Look what they did to those planes.
What good is a helicopter?

535
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,625
- We have to take a chance.
- A chance?

536
01:05:17,584 --> 01:05:20,629
They just nuked the city,
and you wanna wave hello?

537
01:05:20,671 --> 01:05:23,882
I just need you to back off.
We have to try...

538
01:05:24,424 --> 01:05:25,592
Oh shit.

539
01:05:27,052 --> 01:05:28,262
You just gonna stand there?

540
01:05:28,345 --> 01:05:30,389
What happens when the rest
of the blocks fall?

541
01:05:30,389 --> 01:05:32,474
We really don't have
enough bed sheets.

542
01:05:33,851 --> 01:05:36,687
- Come on.
- How can you be so sure?

543
01:05:36,687 --> 01:05:37,980
Let's just go!

544
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,566
You're in no condition to
decide anything.

545
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:42,317
Who knows what side you're on.

546
01:05:43,235 --> 01:05:44,528
I'm warning you.

547
01:05:44,945 --> 01:05:47,114
Stop it!
Both of you!

548
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,366
Look at his face.

549
01:05:50,325 --> 01:05:51,451
He's sick.

550
01:05:53,745 --> 01:05:56,582
- Don't make me hurt you.
- Oh, don't worry.

551
01:06:07,342 --> 01:06:10,137
I'm not leaving without my family.

552
01:06:11,763 --> 01:06:15,893
There is nothing,
that you can do to stop us.

553
01:06:18,478 --> 01:06:20,230
Elaine, you have to trust me.

554
01:06:30,616 --> 01:06:31,867
It's me.

555
01:06:41,335 --> 01:06:43,504
It's still...
me.

556
01:06:52,054 --> 01:06:53,180
I know.

557
01:06:58,644 --> 01:06:59,978
We have to go.

558
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:09,112
- He's gonna get us killed.
- Come on.

559
01:07:29,174 --> 01:07:30,342
Come on.

560
01:07:41,228 --> 01:07:42,729
Alright, lets go.

561
01:08:00,455 --> 01:08:01,832
You see anything?

562
01:08:06,628 --> 01:08:08,088
They're right there.

563
01:08:13,302 --> 01:08:15,262
- Help.
- Help us!

564
01:08:15,262 --> 01:08:16,305
Don't move!

565
01:08:16,388 --> 01:08:18,098
- Don't shoot.
- No, no, wait

566
01:08:18,182 --> 01:08:20,976
- Stay where you are!
- We need help, please.

567
01:08:21,059 --> 01:08:22,644
We gotta get over there.

568
01:09:19,576 --> 01:09:20,702
No... no... no!

569
01:09:23,372 --> 01:09:24,581
No!...

570
01:09:34,091 --> 01:09:35,467
Come on!

571
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:39,471
Roger that, I see two people in
shelter, go get them...

572
01:09:49,106 --> 01:09:51,692
- Hey... hey... hey!...
- Hey!

573
01:10:24,141 --> 01:10:26,226
No!...

574
01:11:26,036 --> 01:11:27,079
Come on.

575
01:11:30,916 --> 01:11:32,292
Oh, my God.

576
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:36,755
Jarrod...

577
01:11:45,722 --> 01:11:47,808
Go... go... go!

578
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:13,792
The scaffold... it's the only way down.
Come on, go!

579
01:13:17,689 --> 01:13:18,982
Leni, run!

580
01:15:11,553 --> 01:15:12,596
Fuck!

581
01:15:22,272 --> 01:15:24,942
Vaya con Dios
you son of a bitch!

582
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:42,668
Help me! Help.
Help me...

583
01:16:38,348 --> 01:16:43,729
Jarrod. Look, look at me.
Look at me, Jarrod.

584
01:16:54,865 --> 01:16:57,034
Get up.
Come on.

585
01:17:34,571 --> 01:17:36,031
Now it's able see us.

586
01:19:12,211 --> 01:19:13,378
Leni, please.

587
01:19:14,922 --> 01:19:15,964
You have to go.

588
01:19:18,425 --> 01:19:20,677
I'm not going anywhere without you.

589
01:23:02,441 --> 01:23:03,609
Jarrod!

590
01:24:48,839 --> 01:24:50,174
My baby!

591
01:26:10,003 --> 01:26:11,380
Jarrod...
