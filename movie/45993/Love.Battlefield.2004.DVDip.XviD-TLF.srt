1
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,642
She dropped her shoe in the river

2
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:56,885
Miss

3
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,520
Let me help you

4
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:02,085
Be careful

5
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:23,911
- Thank you 
- Don't mention it

6
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,549
Are you a local?

7
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,919
- I'm from Hong Kong 
- Really?

8
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:31,856
I live in Hong Kong, holiday here

9
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:33,383
I'm also from Hong Kong

10
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:38,421
Let me drive you

11
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,323
Let me drive you

12
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:41,665
It's too much to ask for

13
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:43,100
This bike is good

14
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:43,860
- Really? 
- Really

15
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:45,063
Alright, thanks

16
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:47,605
Take your time

17
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,642
OK

18
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:58,315
Sorry

19
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:46,956
Are you watching X-rated DVD?

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,728
No

21
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,495
I don't care. Throw it away

22
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:54,900
Told you not to add too much water

23
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,431
How can anyone eat such mushy rice?

24
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:59,240
Why don't you admit your mistakes?

25
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,303
Drink the soup

26
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,508
I'm not drinking it

27
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,758
I thought you've learned swimming

28
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,151
Don't you know?

29
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,594
It's been 2 years since we went swimming

30
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,598
You always said you will learn

31
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:21,324
I wanted to, but didn't have time

32
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,299
Then don't plan this trip to Guam

33
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,669
I thought you wanted to go

34
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,836
Not Guam. I want to go to Europe

35
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:34,670
You know I'm afraid of the cold

36
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,595
Hey, why are you so late?

37
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,571
Any table yet?

38
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:01,574
Of course not

39
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,599
I'm late on purpose

40
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,634
When I'm late, you never get seats

41
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,270
What do you mean? What's wrong?

42
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:09,546
Take this and talk to Sis

43
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,550
You know Sis

44
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,449
No. 48, a long way to go

45
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:15,511
We were only an hour late

46
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,715
Chi-bo must love you a lot

47
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,056
You're off work early, where to?

48
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,288
Get the payout for her

49
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:25,226
Master

50
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,825
- What do you want?
- Pan-fried veggies with pork please

51
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,768
Bitter cucumber

52
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,271
I'd like bitter cucumber with pork

53
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:34,866
Bitter cucumber soup

54
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:36,540
Hey, hold on

55
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,138
Everything you order is bitter

56
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:40,509
Why don't you eat shit?

57
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:42,672
Very funny?

58
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:43,880
Quite...

59
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:44,915
Let me order

60
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,285
Braised chicken, pork in soy sauce

61
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,117
Pig's intestine with pickles

62
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:51,385
Steamed pomfret, fried spare ribs

63
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:55,017
And a corn soup with fish maw OK

64
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:56,921
Didn't you want Salted Chicken?

65
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,932
It will be the 7th dish

66
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:01,865
That's unlucky

67
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,329
Don't order it

68
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:04,495
You like it

69
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:05,929
I told you it's unlucky

70
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:11,340
Order if you like it, one...
I don't want it

71
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:13,540
She doesn't want it, thanks

72
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:16,948
Fried noodles with spare ribs, thanks

73
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,617
Why you still add to the order?

74
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,743
You are just too much!

75
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,447
I don't like what you ordered

76
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,182
You still expect us to pay?

77
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,484
Let's go dutch

78
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,082
We'll only pay for our one dish

79
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:28,388
Are you OK?

80
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:30,223
Here...

81
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,128
Why are you so late?

82
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,632
Police is here to check your ID

83
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,963
Can you be more serious?

84
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,128
- I saw you in the Police Magazine
- Really?

85
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,137
The one who cheated on the old lady

86
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,331
Was it good? Yeah

87
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:39,895
OK

88
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,336
Have you guys ordered yet?

89
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:42,238
Yes, we did

90
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,235
Have you ordered Salted Chicken?

91
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:45,608
That's your favourite dish

92
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:47,541
Please add a Salted Chicken

93
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,478
Regular size?

94
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,175
A half chicken, there're many of us

95
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:52,275
Make it a whole chicken OK

96
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,031
Overtake him, nobody's around

97
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,137
It'll mark my record. 
In a hurry?

98
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,202
No, stop the car for all I care

99
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,378
It's a red light!

100
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,518
You're in a hurry

101
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,821
Kiddo, do you know how to drive?

102
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,888
You're the one who hit my car

103
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,200
Because you slammed on the brakes

104
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,897
What an attitude. You've hit my car

105
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,466
You slammed on the brakes

106
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,670
And you don't?

107
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:52,700
You got hit every time you brake?

108
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,303
Do I need to pay you back?

109
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,746
Just wait till the cops are here

110
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,272
What a thug! I can be one too!

111
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,944
Pay for my broken lights, don't go

112
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,317
OK, be calm, wait for the cops

113
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,345
We'll just take the alcohol test

114
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,554
And see who's right, don't go

115
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:06,785
You can't even take a word or two?

116
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:07,952
Faggot

117
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,188
Looks like it

118
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:11,128
We should check it on his ID card

119
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,654
These people don't have ID cards
Refugees!

120
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:16,190
Refugees...

121
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,340
Pathetic... maybe it has scars

122
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,810
Scarface? I'd rather die

123
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,706
There's no need to kill yourself

124
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,080
Life's precious

125
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:35,550
Excuse me

126
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,552
Hello

127
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:42,355
I'm at the travel agent
Which part of Europe do you want to go?

128
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,386
Wherever you like

129
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,930
What're you doing? You're working

130
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,733
Talk on the phone? Ridiculous!

131
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,172
Talk to you later. I've to work

132
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:03,980
What's the matter? Why so urgent?

133
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,481
I lent you money and you got a car?

134
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:17,092
Look at me. I came in such a hurry

135
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,154
I didn't even take off the goggles

136
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:20,995
If I'm not sincere

137
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:24,025
I won't be here to tell you...

138
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,469
I don't have money

139
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:33,434
Do you want to see me so petty?

140
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,210
You... are an ER nurse

141
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,217
You've got a girlfriend, a car

142
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,783
Me... a car mechanic

143
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,947
Two girls, no car

144
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,415
I really need the money, man

145
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,358
Think for me, please

146
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:52,262
Travel? You're only wasting money

147
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,998
No fun. Go borrow from the sharks

148
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,228
I'll find you a guarantor

149
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,841
I really can't borrow anymore

150
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,936
My credit's all bad

151
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,512
Then... I'm leaving

152
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,666
Thanks, please wait for my receipt

153
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:29,729
Thank you

154
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,569
It's your money. I'll pay you back

155
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:39,540
Don't worry

156
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:13,241
Brush your teeth

157
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,610
It's very cold there

158
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,309
OK, there's no time, brush now

159
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:29,259
What?

160
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,293
Nothing

161
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:33,510
Good morning

162
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:34,917
Good morning Good morning

163
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,179
Where're you going so early?

164
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,746
We're going to China, and you?

165
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,314
Really? We're going to Europe

166
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,791
Wow! That's great! Yes!

167
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,360
Did you call your folks?

168
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,196
Why do I have to call them?

169
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,198
Just to let them know

170
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,063
I did, I left a message

171
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,702
Where should we park our car?

172
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:53,034
We can park... at the airport

173
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:57,008
Because it's not expensive there

174
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:58,407
We can park as long as we like

175
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,877
Really not expensive? Yes

176
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:06,446
Where's the car?

177
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,348
Did you park elsewhere?

178
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,614
No, it was here last night

179
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,453
Then it should be here

180
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:15,619
Why has it disappeared?

181
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:17,590
We don't have time

182
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:19,854
Call the cops

183
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,867
Then we'll have to go with them

184
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:22,993
We don't have time

185
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,101
But the luggage is in the car...

186
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,967
Don't worry, we can buy it there

187
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,402
I'll go and find a cop

188
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,705
That's the same as going there

189
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:32,733
We don't have time

190
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:33,767
I think I should call them

191
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,041
Then are we still going or not?

192
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,105
Do you think I can still enjoy?

193
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,480
How can I have fun now?

194
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:41,144
But we've paid 60 grand for it

195
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,449
I'll pay you back

196
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,820
If you can, I wouldn't have to pay

197
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,762
I have to go because you've paid?

198
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,256
You said you want to go

199
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:56,268
No, you wanted to go to Europe

200
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,930
Then you never wanted to go?

201
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:00,627
I'll go by myself

202
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,568
Let's go together...

203
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:07,909
Don't go if you don't want to!

204
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,175
What do you want?

205
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,206
I want to travel with you happily

206
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,341
How can I be happy? Smile at you?

207
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:14,682
My car has disappeared!

208
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,620
Go look for your car. I'm going

209
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:19,746
You're so unreasonable! OK...

210
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:20,884
I'm not going!

211
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:26,561
I'm not going!

212
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,661
I did what you wanted, now what?

213
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:34,038
You are doing what I want?

214
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:35,404
I cooked when you asked me to

215
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,072
I went scuba diving with you

216
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,338
Even when I can't swim well

217
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,538
You want to travel and be happy...

218
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:41,944
What else do you want me to do?

219
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,972
I don't want you to brush me off!

220
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,950
Did you have fun scuba diving?

221
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,509
What a look you gave me afterwards

222
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,987
You cooked mushy rice on purpose

223
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,512
I cooked mushy rice on purpose?

224
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,219
Yes! You did that on purpose!

225
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,028
You knew we need money, why lend it?

226
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,121
I lent it to him long ago

227
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,021
Why didn't you tell me?

228
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,863
Did you think of my feelings?

229
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,166
I didn't think of your feeling?

230
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,763
Then you wouldn't watch the pornos

231
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,304
Why do you have to bring it up?

232
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,036
Sex is the best part for you

233
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:14,809
It's hard to be with you

234
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:15,677
Me too

235
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:16,612
Then let's break up!

236
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:14,873
I'm going to the police station

237
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,979
Roger

238
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,150
Can you read me?

239
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,557
Yes, clearly. You can keep saying

240
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:38,719
Isn't that watch great?

241
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:41,361
Film after dinner, OK?

242
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,979
If we have it, we won't be parted

243
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,482
You can find me and I can find you

244
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:07,285
Mister, please turn back

245
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,376
Stop please

246
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,744
Get on the car

247
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,952
What are you doing?

248
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:54,652
My friend isn't feeling well

249
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,021
I don't know them!

250
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:56,925
Stand still!

251
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:58,663
Show me your ID card

252
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,833
Stand still! Come over, ID card

253
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:03,532
Slowly

254
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:07,597
What's inside the bag?

255
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:09,069
Put down the bag

256
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:11,600
I'm telling you to put it down!

257
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,275
Hands up!

258
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,110
Freeze!

259
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,250
Hands up!

260
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,485
Take out your hands!

261
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,907
29901, what's happening there? 29901

262
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,137
What are you doing?

263
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:17,567
It's not my business

264
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,405
Drive!

265
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,454
You've been a nurse for how long?

266
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:48,432
Five years

267
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,970
You can speak in Cantonese

268
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,008
In which ward?

269
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,015
ER

270
00:21:58,383 --> 00:21:59,407
Can you do surgery?

271
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:02,080
Learned that at school

272
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:08,255
Bro, we've 3 hours until the deal

273
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:10,761
The cops have seen this car

274
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,922
Go to your home

275
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:14,295
There might be someone at my home

276
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,214
Which floor? Which flat?

277
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:42,418
4C

278
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:48,195
Drive

279
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,724
Where to?

280
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:00,733
Why do you call and don't talk?

281
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:01,932
I'm hanging up if you don't talk

282
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,363
Find a space to park

283
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:03,332
Help!

284
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:05,736
Help... Pass it to me

285
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,438
Fuck you!

286
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:34,990
Don't! No...

287
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,241
You're a fucking trouble maker

288
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:59,682
Ching

289
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:03,459
4th floor?

290
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:07,126
Ching...

291
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:10,295
Come out!

292
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:13,367
Help him immediately

293
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:23,271
Relax, slowly...

294
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:28,409
His pulse is very weak

295
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,551
Does he have any heart disease?

296
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:33,784
Yes he does, you'd better help him

297
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:38,654
He's lost too much blood, gunshot?

298
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:41,827
Is he in danger?

299
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,230
Let go

300
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:45,625
Is he in danger?

301
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:47,627
I don't know

302
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:57,979
He's breathing normally

303
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,214
His lungs should be fine

304
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,090
Mister...

305
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,991
Wake up...

306
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,392
What are you doing?

307
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:17,793
It's OK

308
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:36,116
It's me

309
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,615
We've had an accident, don't worry

310
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:43,589
We'll call when we're there, bye

311
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:57,299
We're fine here, don't worry

312
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:06,908
I've cleaned his wound, it hurts

313
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,316
Let me wrap him up first

314
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:12,022
Good, you have to save him

315
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:14,025
If he's not OK, you're dead

316
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:47,817
Get out of my way!

317
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,996
Help him change

318
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,842
Slowly

319
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:38,201
I'm very hungry

320
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:41,911
Go make something to eat

321
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,722
I can see that

322
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:03,966
You don't know how to cook

323
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,303
Your girlfriend takes care of you?

324
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,442
What a dope you are

325
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,618
No wonder he didn't answer my call

326
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:26,885
You've really left him?

327
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,727
Only a gesture, isn't it?

328
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,646
It's my fault. I'm bad

329
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:54,451
Why is it your fault?

330
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:55,474
Shut up

331
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:57,577
You've even packed?

332
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,756
He lent me money... did you know?

333
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:13,630
You... probably do

334
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:16,369
Or else, he would not...

335
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:19,166
threaten me to pay him back

336
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:22,709
Here's 50 grand

337
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:27,481
It's for him. I'm giving it to you

338
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:33,981
Take it or you two will be over

339
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,856
Why think so much?

340
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:39,487
I borrowed, but you're still over

341
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:44,029
What's crucial in a relationship?

342
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,528
It's love

343
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:50,597
There'll be times that it's boring

344
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,075
But he still cares about you

345
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:59,348
No matter what, take it

346
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:01,379
Hey

347
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:12,087
You eat first

348
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,783
Shit! So mushy, how can I eat it?

349
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:42,120
There's some soup, I'll heat it up

350
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:44,621
Somebody answering...

351
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:45,786
Quick

352
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,225
Hello?

353
00:33:58,469 --> 00:33:59,766
Why don't you say anything?

354
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,041
Where are you?

355
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:13,378
Why does it concern you?

356
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,083
If you don't talk, I'll hang up

357
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:24,652
Wait...

358
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:32,768
Sorry

359
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:02,057
I'm bringing her back now. Alright

360
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,159
Don't...

361
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,530
I just want to tell her not to

362
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,530
It's her bad luck if she comes

363
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:12,676
I only told her not to come back

364
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:14,978
It's bad for you if she comes back

365
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:21,240
Go in, don't pretend

366
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:24,280
Don't worry, it'll be OK

367
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,240
You shut up

368
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:28,644
ER

369
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:37,851
Looks like no one's inside

370
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:41,997
- Chi-bo, call him 
- Me again?

371
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:48,332
Answering machine

372
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:52,069
How can he say nothing and leave?

373
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:20,736
Blood!

374
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:54,466
Lighter

375
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:03,403
Yui? Are you Yui?

376
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:15,386
Yui! Is that you?

377
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:18,251
Yui, are you there?

378
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:19,962
Is it him?

379
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:21,555
He must be somewhere near

380
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:27,829
Yui, are you there? Are you OK?

381
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:31,435
Get out of my way!

382
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:32,169
Hold on to him!

383
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:33,437
Help me hold on to him

384
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:35,941
Yui, are you there? Are you OK?

385
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:38,513
Yui!

386
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:40,710
Yui... where are you? Yui...

387
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:41,513
Yui!

388
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:44,410
Yui! Where are you?

389
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:02,870
Yui!...

390
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,672
Do you think that's he?

391
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:14,343
Come here! Help him!

392
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:16,250
He's having a hard time, quick!

393
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:19,116
Cold...

394
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,220
How's he?

395
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:28,528
Dangerous

396
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:33,565
So cold

397
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,645
He'll die if he takes some more

398
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:53,485
Not your business

399
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,463
Don't sleep! Wake up!

400
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,724
You're a thief, don't sleep!

401
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:06,498
Bro, don't give up!

402
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:32,728
Sir, we've waited for a long time

403
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:35,561
We know your boss, Mr. Ho

404
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,067
Mr. Ho is very busy, please wait

405
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,199
Bullshit

406
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:42,167
Please put out the cigarette

407
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:43,833
No smoking in the police station

408
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:49,338
Why are they so busy?

409
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:53,411
Many cops died this morning

410
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:55,113
Don't you know the taboo of cops?

411
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,317
Someone killing cops

412
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:04,520
Sis, where are you going? Sis...

413
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:08,857
Tell me the truth now!

414
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:12,331
Shooting a movie?

415
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:13,660
Sir

416
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,131
Who let you guys in?

417
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:17,700
Sir, I told them to wait outside

418
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:18,935
They barged in themselves

419
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,275
We don't want to cause you trouble

420
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,041
But something happened to Ka-yui

421
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:25,810
Yui was kidnapped

422
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:29,017
Go out first... go out first!

423
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:30,821
No, he really did...

424
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:32,819
OK...

425
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:39,427
How did he get kidnapped?

426
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:42,862
He looks kidnapped when I saw him

427
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:46,900
And you. Did you guys see it?

428
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:51,501
They didn't see it, only you did

429
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,840
Something's wrong, just now I saw...

430
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:57,140
You guys quarrelled in the morning

431
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,615
He left, you think he's kidnapped

432
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:02,148
Then he comes home, can't find you

433
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,676
He thinks you're missing

434
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,822
Should I report both the cases?

435
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,519
Then sue you for wasting our time?

436
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:11,689
Don't make it big

437
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:15,028
We're here because you're a friend

438
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:19,464
Sorry, all the cops are busy

439
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:23,697
If you need anything, call 999

440
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:26,603
Should we report it?

441
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:28,842
Yes

442
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,411
Comrade Sir

443
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:36,919
Take them to the reporting room

444
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:39,384
All of you, please come with me

445
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:00,568
Brother...

446
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:01,802
How's he now?

447
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:04,937
Very stable

448
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,239
You said not to let him sleep

449
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:13,456
Let him rest. Rest is important

450
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:16,647
You stay with your brother

451
00:44:39,111 --> 00:44:41,579
Bro, there's something wrong here

452
00:44:42,381 --> 00:44:43,439
We'd better leave

453
00:44:45,484 --> 00:44:46,416
We can't

454
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:50,083
We lost a brother's life for this

455
00:44:52,391 --> 00:44:53,881
Second bro is dead

456
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:09,706
After the deal, we'll let you go

457
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:13,035
You know why I hit your head?

458
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,814
T o save your life to help my bro

459
00:45:25,858 --> 00:45:27,291
You two are very close?

460
00:45:35,601 --> 00:45:38,866
He is very serious, if something...

461
00:45:38,904 --> 00:45:40,098
What did you say?

462
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:45,133
He is really very serious

463
00:45:47,346 --> 00:45:49,746
I'm here, where are you?

464
00:45:50,883 --> 00:45:53,351
You tried so hard to get the goods

465
00:45:54,019 --> 00:45:55,418
Why risk your lives now?

466
00:45:56,989 --> 00:45:59,082
Why live on with no money?

467
00:46:00,259 --> 00:46:02,284
Leave the goods

468
00:46:02,327 --> 00:46:03,555
I'll let you live

469
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:05,157
Or else...

470
00:46:05,731 --> 00:46:07,358
You'll lose your life and goods

471
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:11,031
You can't trust Hong Kong people

472
00:46:11,804 --> 00:46:12,862
It is Hong Kong here

473
00:46:13,338 --> 00:46:14,828
Who allowed you to speak, dope!

474
00:46:28,687 --> 00:46:30,917
Brother...

475
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:32,679
Why is he like this?

476
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,993
Wake him up for me!

477
00:46:52,411 --> 00:46:54,208
Let go of me

478
00:47:23,008 --> 00:47:23,804
Bastard!

479
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,565
Somebody...

480
00:48:23,602 --> 00:48:26,469
Help...

481
00:48:35,314 --> 00:48:36,076
Are you alright?

482
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:39,044
Is there pain? Yes...

483
00:48:48,227 --> 00:48:49,125
Sit down

484
00:48:53,732 --> 00:48:54,357
Relax

485
00:48:54,933 --> 00:48:56,366
My stomach...

486
00:48:57,236 --> 00:48:58,294
Relax, I'll help you

487
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,504
Don't yell...

488
00:49:02,941 --> 00:49:03,965
My stomach... Shush...

489
00:49:12,751 --> 00:49:13,615
What's wrong here?

490
00:49:13,952 --> 00:49:15,249
It's all their people on the boat

491
00:49:16,521 --> 00:49:17,818
It's lucky I saw him in time

492
00:49:22,794 --> 00:49:23,658
Press on it hard

493
00:49:23,695 --> 00:49:24,992
When will the boat come?

494
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:26,854
Elbow up and lie down

495
00:49:27,165 --> 00:49:28,462
I'll call you

496
00:49:35,207 --> 00:49:36,504
How many months?

497
00:49:37,042 --> 00:49:38,009
Seven

498
00:49:40,112 --> 00:49:41,136
First baby?

499
00:49:43,548 --> 00:49:44,674
Still painful?

500
00:49:50,055 --> 00:49:50,919
OK

501
00:49:58,597 --> 00:49:59,996
Take away your hands

502
00:50:32,331 --> 00:50:34,162
I've done all I can, what else?

503
00:50:35,534 --> 00:50:37,434
Do you remember what I said to you?

504
00:50:46,378 --> 00:50:48,141
He needs to be hospitalized

505
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,511
What else do you want of me?

506
00:50:49,614 --> 00:50:52,378
If not for your wife, I'd be gone

507
00:50:52,517 --> 00:50:54,781
How many people have you killed?

508
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:57,721
I saved you, but you killed them

509
00:50:57,756 --> 00:51:01,123
Yours are lives, theirs are not?

510
00:51:01,793 --> 00:51:03,852
Those with guns survive!

511
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:07,524
Lives? These are your lives!

512
00:51:40,365 --> 00:51:42,925
Come out...

513
00:51:44,603 --> 00:51:46,434
Come on, out!

514
00:51:48,673 --> 00:51:49,662
Come out!

515
00:51:51,743 --> 00:51:55,702
Come out...

516
00:51:58,483 --> 00:51:59,711
Come out!

517
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,736
Who will drive if we kill him?

518
00:52:23,275 --> 00:52:24,401
Take Papa Shun with us

519
00:52:50,969 --> 00:52:53,870
Why isn't there air-con here?

520
00:52:56,274 --> 00:52:59,539
Honestly, the cops are really busy

521
00:53:00,145 --> 00:53:03,808
Or else we won't have waited 1 hour

522
00:53:04,749 --> 00:53:06,148
I'm leaving

523
00:53:07,886 --> 00:53:09,877
It's none of my business

524
00:53:09,921 --> 00:53:12,583
I really got to work, excuse me

525
00:53:14,793 --> 00:53:16,556
Some nerve...

526
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,535
We've waited for so long

527
00:53:24,669 --> 00:53:27,365
Why not go out and find him

528
00:53:30,442 --> 00:53:33,639
I'm really busy

529
00:53:33,845 --> 00:53:36,712
I'll lend you my "beloved"

530
00:53:37,015 --> 00:53:40,644
I'll come after I finish my business

531
00:53:43,021 --> 00:53:43,851
Thank you

532
00:53:44,756 --> 00:53:46,246
Deal

533
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:49,490
Don't go!

534
00:53:53,298 --> 00:53:54,356
What's wrong?

535
00:53:54,399 --> 00:53:55,696
Both of you follow me

536
00:54:00,872 --> 00:54:03,170
You, follow me here

537
00:54:03,642 --> 00:54:04,438
What's the matter?

538
00:54:04,476 --> 00:54:07,274
Follow you? Separately? Why? Walk

539
00:54:07,445 --> 00:54:08,969
We are only here to report a case
Come here!

540
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:14,711
Could you give us a minute?

541
00:54:20,325 --> 00:54:22,190
Have you heard anything about Yui?

542
00:54:24,896 --> 00:54:27,660
Who does Yui hang out with?

543
00:54:34,406 --> 00:54:36,840
You and I both know his friends

544
00:54:39,945 --> 00:54:43,073
Do you know for sure what he does?

545
00:54:47,419 --> 00:54:49,319
What about him?

546
00:54:49,988 --> 00:54:54,015
At 7:30 this morning, 6 cops were

547
00:54:54,059 --> 00:54:56,527
shot to death on the street

548
00:54:56,828 --> 00:55:00,696
Half an hour later in a car park

549
00:55:00,732 --> 00:55:02,962
A security guard was assaulted

550
00:55:03,268 --> 00:55:05,168
An hour ago in another car park

551
00:55:05,203 --> 00:55:08,536
There was a gun fight

552
00:55:08,707 --> 00:55:11,733
8 bodies were left on the scene

553
00:55:12,244 --> 00:55:16,647
A witness saw someone escape

554
00:55:18,316 --> 00:55:19,874
He took a picture

555
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:26,479
If I can recognize him, so can you

556
00:55:28,893 --> 00:55:31,885
It can't be him... Crazy!

557
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:33,322
Tell me...

558
00:55:34,933 --> 00:55:38,130
Do you know what he does?

559
00:55:38,603 --> 00:55:39,570
You can't even answer me!

560
00:55:39,604 --> 00:55:41,663
I saw somebody kidnapped him!

561
00:55:41,706 --> 00:55:43,139
I can't figure out...

562
00:55:43,174 --> 00:55:46,837
Why the crooks are keeping him?

563
00:55:53,785 --> 00:55:57,414
You've gotta stay here for 48 hrs

564
00:56:03,862 --> 00:56:04,328
Hello?

565
00:56:05,363 --> 00:56:09,800
No Sir, we have 3 scenes, 1 5 lives
all in eight hours

566
00:56:09,834 --> 00:56:13,065
We have finally find a suspect...

567
00:56:27,018 --> 00:56:29,077
Grandy, don't want it anymore

568
00:57:24,809 --> 00:57:25,741
Fuck!

569
00:57:40,692 --> 00:57:41,659
How dare you...

570
00:57:44,662 --> 00:57:45,560
Get out of here!

571
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:47,257
Let go of me!
Just helping a friend...

572
00:57:47,298 --> 00:57:48,162
Go!

573
00:57:48,266 --> 00:57:50,359
Let me go!

574
00:57:51,035 --> 00:57:52,332
Help a friend

575
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:54,600
Let me go!

576
00:58:26,938 --> 00:58:27,700
Stop the car!

577
00:58:36,981 --> 00:58:37,845
Let's go

578
00:58:41,886 --> 00:58:44,480
The goods are gone. We can't go

579
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:06,899
Go downtown

580
01:00:13,845 --> 01:00:14,903
Do you want a drink?

581
01:00:14,946 --> 01:00:16,038
A cup of hot milk tea

582
01:00:37,936 --> 01:00:38,664
Drive

583
01:00:39,771 --> 01:00:40,703
Where to?

584
01:00:41,573 --> 01:00:42,562
Drive!

585
01:01:31,022 --> 01:01:35,049
Are you nearby? Yui...

586
01:01:40,898 --> 01:01:42,092
Take a turn

587
01:02:19,804 --> 01:02:21,032
Drive into it

588
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:26,406
Drive right into it!

589
01:03:45,923 --> 01:03:47,015
Ching! Yui!

590
01:03:51,596 --> 01:03:53,962
Yui, come out...

591
01:03:54,532 --> 01:03:55,328
Ching!

592
01:03:56,834 --> 01:03:57,766
Yui!

593
01:04:02,673 --> 01:04:03,970
Yui, come out...

594
01:04:05,576 --> 01:04:06,508
Just go!

595
01:04:09,347 --> 01:04:10,905
Yui, please come out...

596
01:04:12,483 --> 01:04:13,950
Yui... Ching...

597
01:04:16,454 --> 01:04:17,182
Ching!

598
01:04:28,599 --> 01:04:29,156
Drive

599
01:04:30,802 --> 01:04:32,133
Just fucking drive!

600
01:04:35,873 --> 01:04:37,841
If you don't, I'll shoot her!

601
01:05:02,834 --> 01:05:04,358
Yui

602
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:20,077
Go save my husband

603
01:06:22,113 --> 01:06:23,808
I told you to go save my husband!

604
01:06:27,318 --> 01:06:29,786
I let her go, I don't want to hurt her

605
01:06:30,154 --> 01:06:32,679
Go save him! Go!

606
01:06:41,198 --> 01:06:42,222
Do it

607
01:06:46,437 --> 01:06:47,995
Check out how my brother is

608
01:07:01,953 --> 01:07:02,942
I'm fine

609
01:07:06,891 --> 01:07:09,985
Help me...

610
01:07:15,366 --> 01:07:16,390
How is he?

611
01:07:19,904 --> 01:07:21,462
Not sure of his internal organs

612
01:07:23,975 --> 01:07:25,135
What should we do?

613
01:07:27,545 --> 01:07:29,069
When will your ship come?

614
01:07:30,448 --> 01:07:31,745
2 hrs later

615
01:07:33,818 --> 01:07:35,285
Can you hang on till then?

616
01:07:36,988 --> 01:07:39,718
You need blood transfusion to live

617
01:07:41,859 --> 01:07:43,224
Where is the blood bank?

618
01:07:43,728 --> 01:07:45,628
It's not easy, I can't help you

619
01:07:51,869 --> 01:07:53,461
Nobody can recognize me now

620
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:02,543
Wait for me

621
01:08:03,647 --> 01:08:04,636
Wait

622
01:08:31,909 --> 01:08:34,036
You guys aren't worth being saved

623
01:08:50,861 --> 01:08:52,829
You never told me what happened

624
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:54,387
How can I help you?

625
01:08:56,167 --> 01:08:59,136
I can't tell you, but it's crucial

626
01:09:21,025 --> 01:09:23,323
Your boyfriend is with me

627
01:09:25,296 --> 01:09:26,729
What do you want?

628
01:09:28,099 --> 01:09:29,691
Do what I tell you

629
01:09:30,367 --> 01:09:32,995
Get 4 bags of O-positive blood

630
01:09:34,105 --> 01:09:36,596
I'll tell you where to send it to

631
01:09:37,508 --> 01:09:40,238
Hey... Hey!

632
01:09:44,515 --> 01:09:47,382
Last time, I left. Now, we're even

633
01:09:49,854 --> 01:09:50,718
Thank you

634
01:09:52,823 --> 01:09:54,415
I'll lose my job

635
01:09:57,561 --> 01:10:01,122
That's OK. I have so few friends

636
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:04,597
I don't know what's going on

637
01:10:05,402 --> 01:10:07,199
I just want Yui safe and sound

638
01:10:11,809 --> 01:10:12,298
Hello?

639
01:10:13,144 --> 01:10:14,873
Take the blood to the 5th floor

640
01:10:14,912 --> 01:10:18,279
Ward 3, Bed 6. Hurry up

641
01:10:20,351 --> 01:10:21,181
What's up?

642
01:10:21,585 --> 01:10:22,552
I have to go. Thank you

643
01:10:30,127 --> 01:10:32,425
Where is Ward 3?

644
01:10:32,463 --> 01:10:33,521
Just go straight

645
01:10:33,898 --> 01:10:34,660
Thanks

646
01:11:17,708 --> 01:11:19,767
Wait outside, doctors are working

647
01:11:19,977 --> 01:11:21,535
Please leave, doctors are working

648
01:11:21,579 --> 01:11:24,207
Please wait outside, miss

649
01:12:05,656 --> 01:12:06,623
Wait a second!

650
01:13:02,079 --> 01:13:04,411
Excuse me

651
01:13:59,336 --> 01:13:59,961
Madam

652
01:14:00,003 --> 01:14:00,799
What's up?

653
01:14:03,307 --> 01:14:06,037
Hubby, I've a situation, can't come

654
01:14:06,076 --> 01:14:08,306
Or else, you should let him sleep

655
01:14:09,613 --> 01:14:10,637
What's wrong, miss?

656
01:14:12,116 --> 01:14:13,777
Where is the ER?

657
01:14:14,218 --> 01:14:15,378
Downstairs

658
01:14:15,853 --> 01:14:16,649
Thanks

659
01:14:45,149 --> 01:14:47,549
Call your hubby to release my man

660
01:14:55,759 --> 01:14:57,693
Where's my boyfriend? Release him!

661
01:15:05,002 --> 01:15:06,833
Yui, is that you?

662
01:15:07,771 --> 01:15:08,795
Ching?

663
01:15:09,706 --> 01:15:11,196
Why did you involve my girl?

664
01:15:11,241 --> 01:15:12,435
It's none of her business!

665
01:15:12,843 --> 01:15:15,141
I did all you said. Keep her out

666
01:15:17,681 --> 01:15:21,674
You can't get the blood without her

667
01:15:26,757 --> 01:15:29,419
Release my wife, or I'll kill him

668
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,250
Let him go, or I'll hurt your wife

669
01:15:33,363 --> 01:15:36,161
Give them to her. I'll let him go

670
01:15:38,268 --> 01:15:39,064
Don't believe him!

671
01:15:39,736 --> 01:15:41,727
He's lying. He won't release me

672
01:15:42,773 --> 01:15:44,968
Blood is all you want. Let him go

673
01:15:46,443 --> 01:15:48,172
He'll be fine after the transfusion

674
01:15:49,079 --> 01:15:51,172
Give me the phone, or we'll all die

675
01:15:51,882 --> 01:15:52,974
I'd rather die than save you!

676
01:15:54,718 --> 01:15:56,208
I know you won't let me go

677
01:15:56,253 --> 01:15:59,416
Because this is thieves' instinct

678
01:16:01,725 --> 01:16:02,953
You'll kill me for sure

679
01:16:04,394 --> 01:16:05,861
But my girlfriend is innocent

680
01:16:25,415 --> 01:16:26,211
Ching

681
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:27,581
Yui, how are you?

682
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:29,708
Listen to me

683
01:16:31,555 --> 01:16:33,785
Just drop the blood and leave

684
01:16:35,626 --> 01:16:38,390
No, I've got to see you first

685
01:16:40,898 --> 01:16:41,830
I'm all right

686
01:16:42,666 --> 01:16:44,998
Don't worry. I'll be fine

687
01:16:45,269 --> 01:16:45,997
Leave now

688
01:16:46,503 --> 01:16:47,868
No way

689
01:16:48,405 --> 01:16:50,873
I'll be fine. You've saved me

690
01:16:52,509 --> 01:16:53,567
Listen to me...

691
01:16:56,313 --> 01:16:57,780
Wait for me at home

692
01:17:01,151 --> 01:17:02,948
I will come back for you

693
01:17:08,458 --> 01:17:10,187
We'll travel together again

694
01:17:36,286 --> 01:17:37,776
Believe what your boyfriend said

695
01:17:39,423 --> 01:17:41,254
Let my wife bring me the blood

696
01:17:47,364 --> 01:17:51,323
We've nowhere to go

697
01:17:52,869 --> 01:17:54,700
We'll definitely be busted

698
01:17:56,373 --> 01:18:00,810
It doesn't matter if your man is alive

699
01:18:04,982 --> 01:18:08,645
No matter what, we can't give up

700
01:18:10,354 --> 01:18:12,254
We will certainly let him go

701
01:18:13,423 --> 01:18:16,790
If anything happens to one of us

702
01:18:18,261 --> 01:18:20,252
Nobody can go

703
01:18:21,298 --> 01:18:25,200
The blood will decide our fate

704
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:57,589
What do you say?

705
01:19:00,003 --> 01:19:01,493
Make sure you do what you say

706
01:19:02,873 --> 01:19:03,965
Of course

707
01:19:06,677 --> 01:19:08,235
Give the phone to my wife first

708
01:19:16,386 --> 01:19:17,410
Bring her with you

709
01:19:19,056 --> 01:19:20,182
Why don't you leave her alone?

710
01:19:36,206 --> 01:19:37,605
Take me to my boyfriend

711
01:19:44,014 --> 01:19:45,709
Your boyfriend is a nice guy

712
01:19:48,618 --> 01:19:49,744
That's none of your business

713
01:20:01,498 --> 01:20:04,399
My husband never lets me help him

714
01:20:12,509 --> 01:20:13,840
So he made my boyfriend drive

715
01:20:16,513 --> 01:20:18,003
You think your hubby's a great man?

716
01:20:18,949 --> 01:20:20,007
He's not even a human being

717
01:20:26,723 --> 01:20:29,886
I guess... he doesn't want you to go

718
01:20:38,135 --> 01:20:40,797
Would you watch your hubby die?

719
01:21:00,290 --> 01:21:01,086
Do you love him?

720
01:21:01,558 --> 01:21:02,286
I do!

721
01:21:04,828 --> 01:21:06,318
I wish you two love always

722
01:21:08,732 --> 01:21:09,699
We surely will!

723
01:21:32,222 --> 01:21:34,156
I saved you. Now you wanna kill me?

724
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,549
Drop the gun!

725
01:22:30,814 --> 01:22:31,473
Drop the gun!

726
01:22:33,650 --> 01:22:35,948
My gang has followed me for 5 years

727
01:22:38,588 --> 01:22:40,522
They all died today

728
01:22:43,159 --> 01:22:46,287
I wanted to treat you as a friend

729
01:22:47,797 --> 01:22:49,128
Drop the gun!

730
01:22:55,205 --> 01:22:57,264
Cause your life is way too easy

731
01:22:58,508 --> 01:23:00,135
You don't cherish life

732
01:23:11,755 --> 01:23:13,848
I'll shoot if you don't drop it!

733
01:23:26,036 --> 01:23:27,003
Yui!

734
01:23:36,613 --> 01:23:37,443
Yui!

735
01:23:39,883 --> 01:23:40,645
Ching!

736
01:23:49,459 --> 01:23:50,221
Ching!

737
01:23:52,963 --> 01:23:53,622
Ching!

738
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:56,589
Ching!

739
01:24:16,252 --> 01:24:17,583
Where's my girlfriend?

740
01:24:20,590 --> 01:24:22,080
Where's my girlfriend?

741
01:24:45,982 --> 01:24:52,945
Ching!

742
01:25:06,169 --> 01:25:07,431
Ching!

743
01:25:30,093 --> 01:25:34,189
I can tell you love her very much

744
01:25:34,297 --> 01:25:34,991
Yes!

745
01:25:36,132 --> 01:25:38,930
It's my bad luck to run into you

746
01:25:39,669 --> 01:25:41,330
But she did nothing

747
01:25:41,371 --> 01:25:42,668
Why didn't you leave her alone?

748
01:25:47,911 --> 01:25:51,608
I've done so much and saved you

749
01:25:52,415 --> 01:25:54,883
I didn't even think of my life

750
01:25:56,519 --> 01:25:58,111
I've done nothing for her

751
01:25:59,622 --> 01:26:01,249
I've done more for you than her

752
01:26:01,291 --> 01:26:03,088
Why don't you leave her alone?

753
01:26:16,973 --> 01:26:18,031
I've said...

754
01:26:19,109 --> 01:26:20,770
If anything happens to one of us

755
01:26:22,011 --> 01:26:23,376
Nobody can go

756
01:27:09,959 --> 01:27:12,120
Everyone has died

757
01:27:13,563 --> 01:27:15,155
But you can come to this world

758
01:27:16,399 --> 01:27:17,889
Be a good person

759
01:27:23,439 --> 01:27:24,633
You are doing what I want?

760
01:27:24,674 --> 01:27:26,335
I cooked when you asked me to

761
01:27:26,376 --> 01:27:28,970
I went scuba diving with you

762
01:27:29,012 --> 01:27:30,001
Even when I can't swim well

763
01:27:30,246 --> 01:27:31,406
You want to travel and be happy...

764
01:27:31,447 --> 01:27:32,641
What else do you want me to do?

765
01:27:33,049 --> 01:27:34,175
I don't want you to brush me off!

766
01:27:35,084 --> 01:27:36,449
It's hard to be with you

767
01:27:36,486 --> 01:27:37,282
Me too

768
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:38,150
Then let's break up!
