1
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:37,338
Sir?

2
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:40,378
Is this yours?

3
00:02:45,221 --> 00:02:46,879
I'll get you out of there.

4
00:02:47,908 --> 00:02:49,337
No, later.

5
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,337
One, two...

6
00:04:07,525 --> 00:04:09,117
That's so dumb!

7
00:04:13,188 --> 00:04:14,650
But why?

8
00:06:07,012 --> 00:06:08,419
Hey, Georges!

9
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,136
See that?

10
00:06:11,556 --> 00:06:14,141
OK, Georges?
Where were you this morning?

11
00:06:14,437 --> 00:06:16,224
Hey, what's wrong, Georges?

12
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:17,881
Were you in class?

13
00:06:19,172 --> 00:06:21,375
What's that? Let me see.

14
00:06:21,573 --> 00:06:23,460
Wow, that's great!

15
00:06:23,844 --> 00:06:26,331
Where did you get it, Georges?

16
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:28,638
It's made of real steel!

17
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,810
It's great!

18
00:06:35,235 --> 00:06:36,664
Great!

19
00:06:44,067 --> 00:06:45,758
Oh, no! Georges!

20
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:49,376
The what's-it's stuck!

21
00:06:50,147 --> 00:06:51,292
Oh, no!

22
00:07:04,835 --> 00:07:06,428
What have I?

23
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,954
I see what you're thinking...

24
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,363
<i>7 years later</i>

25
00:07:47,395 --> 00:07:49,370
- Let's go.
- No.

26
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,165
Leave me... No!

27
00:07:51,331 --> 00:07:52,476
- Let's go.
- No, you.

28
00:07:52,803 --> 00:07:53,883
- Let's not go.
- Quiet.

29
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:55,033
No, you.

30
00:07:55,203 --> 00:07:56,926
- Quiet.
- Shut up.

31
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:00,345
- Let's go.
- No.

32
00:08:00,515 --> 00:08:02,206
- Quiet.
- I won't go.

33
00:08:02,372 --> 00:08:04,314
- Quiet.
- OK.

34
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:06,366
Leave me...

35
00:08:06,532 --> 00:08:08,636
- Let's go.
- No, later on.

36
00:08:08,964 --> 00:08:11,483
- Quiet now.
- Now you be quiet.

37
00:08:11,652 --> 00:08:13,145
- Quiet.
- You be quiet.

38
00:08:13,316 --> 00:08:15,203
- Shut up!
- Why?

39
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:18,650
- Calm down.
- I am...

40
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:20,096
I'm quiet.

41
00:08:20,322 --> 00:08:22,079
- Let's go.
- Not go.

42
00:08:22,243 --> 00:08:23,902
- Let's go.
- Careful.

43
00:08:24,324 --> 00:08:25,982
- Quiet.
- I'm silent.

44
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:27,965
- Quiet.
- Why?

45
00:08:31,299 --> 00:08:33,055
- Breathe.
- I am breathing.

46
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:35,834
I am calm.
Be quiet, be quiet.

47
00:08:55,684 --> 00:08:58,204
I'm used to this lifestyle.
I want to stay.

48
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,410
A bit more. Just an extra week.

49
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:01,409
I understand.

50
00:09:01,571 --> 00:09:02,586
Don't answer him.

51
00:09:02,755 --> 00:09:05,057
- Shut up, you.
- Shut up.

52
00:09:06,915 --> 00:09:10,712
Can't I get a dispensation?
I live here. I've found a spot.

53
00:09:11,332 --> 00:09:13,241
- Stop showing off.
- I'm not!

54
00:09:13,572 --> 00:09:14,782
- Enough.
- It's a question!

55
00:09:14,947 --> 00:09:15,841
Shut up.

56
00:09:16,804 --> 00:09:18,811
- Are you dry?
- Fine, thanks.

57
00:09:18,978 --> 00:09:20,604
- OK, shut up.
- No!

58
00:09:20,931 --> 00:09:22,687
- I don't care.
- Put this on.

59
00:09:22,851 --> 00:09:24,313
- Thanks.
- There.

60
00:09:24,643 --> 00:09:25,754
I've lost my bracelet!

61
00:09:25,922 --> 00:09:27,417
My Mexican bracelet.

62
00:09:27,587 --> 00:09:28,765
Look, it's there.

63
00:09:29,284 --> 00:09:31,072
I thought I'd lost it.

64
00:09:31,236 --> 00:09:33,724
- I said, shut up.
- She's crazy! You're crazy!

65
00:09:34,787 --> 00:09:37,570
- Idiot!
- Shut up. Now.

66
00:09:38,435 --> 00:09:39,744
Breathe deeply.

67
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,669
- How are you today, Mr Georges?
- Fine.

68
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,648
- I'm not presentable.
- Sign this.

69
00:10:15,747 --> 00:10:18,136
Thanks.
There's also a telegram for you.

70
00:10:20,035 --> 00:10:21,497
Read it to me.

71
00:10:23,554 --> 00:10:25,277
It's written in capitals.

72
00:10:25,538 --> 00:10:28,026
"Blaise Rouleau released
at noon.

73
00:10:28,418 --> 00:10:32,062
Family unreachable, please go
to..." There's an address.

74
00:10:35,587 --> 00:10:37,442
Want me to read it again?

75
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:40,571
Have a nice day.

76
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:45,568
How are you, Blaise?

77
00:10:45,731 --> 00:10:47,771
Can I stay, sir?

78
00:10:48,673 --> 00:10:50,682
I don't know what to say.

79
00:10:51,523 --> 00:10:53,978
Usually I'm relieved
to see patients leave.

80
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,022
With you, I don't feel
the same way.

81
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:02,338
I'm really pleased
to see you leave.

82
00:11:05,794 --> 00:11:08,445
Before I forget, I made you

83
00:11:08,706 --> 00:11:11,228
a little souvenir compilation.

84
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:15,929
Sorry, I didn't have time
to make a nice cover for it.

85
00:11:16,451 --> 00:11:17,825
It doesn't matter.

86
00:11:18,338 --> 00:11:21,601
Watch it with your kids one day.
It'll give 'em a laugh.

87
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:24,189
Or with my parents...

88
00:11:24,354 --> 00:11:26,526
Whoever you like, I don't care.

89
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,824
Careful... Come on.

90
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:40,312
- That's good.
- Thanks.

91
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:47,353
There... Watch your step.

92
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,417
Thank you.

93
00:12:01,474 --> 00:12:02,586
Luc!

94
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:22,844
I don't understand.

95
00:12:43,235 --> 00:12:44,827
Blaise, it's me!

96
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,846
It's me!

97
00:13:09,762 --> 00:13:11,901
It's me! Georges!

98
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,331
I gotta tell you.

99
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,697
Then, we'll never mention it
again.

100
00:13:28,865 --> 00:13:31,419
I never judged you
for what you did.

101
00:13:31,586 --> 00:13:33,146
We all make mistakes.

102
00:13:34,115 --> 00:13:35,543
Thanks, that's kind.

103
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:38,679
You gotta have fun now,
forget all that stuff.

104
00:13:39,266 --> 00:13:42,135
How about some music?
Know Blue Wet Shirt?

105
00:13:42,434 --> 00:13:44,572
They're hot right now.
You hear them

106
00:13:44,739 --> 00:13:47,226
in airports, bars,
corridors, parks...

107
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:50,902
This is what it's like in
today's world.

108
00:13:51,074 --> 00:13:52,317
Blue Wet Shirt!

109
00:13:57,475 --> 00:13:58,620
Well?

110
00:13:59,265 --> 00:14:00,313
No?

111
00:14:01,346 --> 00:14:02,393
Yeah...

112
00:14:03,874 --> 00:14:06,591
You've missed a lot of stuff
in 7 years!

113
00:14:06,753 --> 00:14:08,609
- Holy cow! 7 years!
- Yeah.

114
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:12,639
No-one says "Holy cow" now,
it's corny.

115
00:14:12,802 --> 00:14:15,485
No-one says "It's corny" either.

116
00:14:15,681 --> 00:14:17,721
Nor "No-one says that"?

117
00:14:18,177 --> 00:14:19,488
No-one says that, either.

118
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,302
But I had to say it,
so you'd understand.

119
00:14:23,587 --> 00:14:25,474
I totally understand.

120
00:14:26,274 --> 00:14:28,249
Have any other things changed?

121
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:30,940
- Have they?
- Lots.

122
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:34,431
For instance,
you no longer say "Hello".

123
00:14:34,593 --> 00:14:36,349
- Really?
- You say "Hi".

124
00:14:37,057 --> 00:14:39,676
Yeah, I already knew that.

125
00:14:39,841 --> 00:14:42,363
But to be with it,
you don't say "Hi".

126
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:43,991
You say "Boot".

127
00:14:44,225 --> 00:14:45,568
- "Boot"?
- Boot.

128
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,920
So, I'd go into a store
and say "Boot"?

129
00:14:51,361 --> 00:14:53,336
If there's anyone there,
you do.

130
00:14:54,658 --> 00:14:56,512
Well, I'll soon adapt.

131
00:14:56,673 --> 00:14:59,805
I'll note this down.
I tend to forget things...

132
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,169
No, wait, stop it!

133
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:03,610
Are you stupid?

134
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:06,330
Did you believe all that crap?

135
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:13,660
Hey, man, humor's changed, too.
We got new humor now!

136
00:15:14,882 --> 00:15:17,729
I'll have to adapt.
I'm still with the old humor.

137
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:20,125
I have to get with it.

138
00:15:20,481 --> 00:15:21,943
It'll come.

139
00:15:22,112 --> 00:15:24,534
Do you wanna hear a recent joke?

140
00:15:25,153 --> 00:15:26,363
A funny one?

141
00:15:28,258 --> 00:15:29,948
See the cloud up there?

142
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:31,576
Which one?

143
00:15:31,906 --> 00:15:33,945
Any one... Look, that one.

144
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,565
- Do I choose?
- No! I mean yes!

145
00:15:37,633 --> 00:15:38,877
See that cloud there?

146
00:15:39,202 --> 00:15:41,535
- So you choose...
- Yes! See that cloud?

147
00:15:41,697 --> 00:15:43,192
- That one.
- Yes?

148
00:15:44,033 --> 00:15:46,685
Hey, doesn't it look like
cotton?

149
00:15:49,761 --> 00:15:51,768
No, you have to answer.

150
00:15:51,937 --> 00:15:53,726
Doesn't it look like cotton?

151
00:15:54,817 --> 00:15:56,824
If we chose that one, no.

152
00:15:57,154 --> 00:15:59,422
- It does.
- That's not important.

153
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:03,125
OK, stop it.
I'll start again. Forget it.

154
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,909
Let's start again.

155
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:08,896
Hey, see the cloud up there?

156
00:16:09,986 --> 00:16:13,150
- The same cloud?
- Yes, it's the same joke.

157
00:16:13,665 --> 00:16:15,607
See the cloud up there?
The same one.

158
00:16:16,514 --> 00:16:20,158
As it didn't work with this one,
I'll pick that one...

159
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:21,855
- Whatever!
- OK.

160
00:16:22,177 --> 00:16:24,633
As long as it's a cloud...
See that cloud?

161
00:16:26,049 --> 00:16:28,732
What does it look like
it's made of?

162
00:16:28,896 --> 00:16:31,482
No, stop it!
I hadn't done the joke.

163
00:16:32,994 --> 00:16:36,638
OK, I'll start again.
You're ruining it.

164
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:38,935
- See the cloud up there?
- Yes.

165
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:40,825
What's it made of?

166
00:16:42,177 --> 00:16:43,966
It looks like some fabric...

167
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,917
No, cotton!

168
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:49,305
- That one?
- Yes, but it doesn't matter!

169
00:16:49,473 --> 00:16:51,381
Just say cotton, that's all.

170
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,870
You've ruined my joke.
I can't finish it!

171
00:16:56,033 --> 00:16:56,983
Sorry.

172
00:16:57,312 --> 00:17:00,346
You ask for a joke,
then you change what it's made of!

173
00:17:00,514 --> 00:17:02,521
I didn't ask - you suggested it.

174
00:17:02,977 --> 00:17:05,312
The old humor was fine by me.

175
00:17:06,785 --> 00:17:09,306
People laughed back then.

176
00:17:09,888 --> 00:17:11,579
I found it funny, too.

177
00:17:12,224 --> 00:17:15,486
I remember a good one...
about cotton, in fact.

178
00:17:16,256 --> 00:17:17,468
A guy goes into a...

179
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:20,316
Not interested. It's old humor.

180
00:17:27,232 --> 00:17:28,312
What are they?

181
00:17:28,832 --> 00:17:31,069
- Those burns?
- What burns?

182
00:17:31,232 --> 00:17:33,142
You've got burns all over...

183
00:17:33,792 --> 00:17:35,385
What? The cigarette?

184
00:17:35,551 --> 00:17:36,380
No, that!

185
00:17:36,545 --> 00:17:38,683
Hey! Don't touch me!

186
00:17:38,848 --> 00:17:40,507
- They're bandages.
- Bandages?

187
00:17:40,673 --> 00:17:42,332
- Yes, bandages.
- Oh...

188
00:17:43,457 --> 00:17:44,918
I've had work done.

189
00:17:45,185 --> 00:17:46,973
Work done on your head?!

190
00:17:48,641 --> 00:17:50,429
Jesus, Georges!

191
00:17:50,592 --> 00:17:52,054
You had your head done!

192
00:17:52,224 --> 00:17:54,111
- My face.
- Your face?

193
00:17:54,432 --> 00:17:56,505
But why? How?

194
00:17:56,928 --> 00:17:58,302
It's more modern.

195
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:07,161
That's funny!
That's a good joke!

196
00:18:07,905 --> 00:18:09,912
That's new humor!

197
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:35,869
Don't sleep in my car!

198
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,171
- It's unhealthy, I hate that.
- I wasn't.

199
00:18:38,336 --> 00:18:40,670
We're nearly there.
You can sleep then.

200
00:18:41,088 --> 00:18:42,549
- I don't want to.
- Need anything?

201
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,058
Some water...

202
00:18:50,017 --> 00:18:51,511
75.

203
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:54,008
Well, really!

204
00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:56,573
- What does that say?
- What?

205
00:18:57,728 --> 00:18:59,419
On your jacket.

206
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:02,336
"Chiters"...

207
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:05,086
Chivers! With a 'v'!

208
00:19:05,472 --> 00:19:07,577
Apparently your glasses
aren't right.

209
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,870
I've been trying to work it out.

210
00:19:11,265 --> 00:19:13,207
It's a football team, right?

211
00:19:13,376 --> 00:19:14,391
No way!

212
00:19:14,561 --> 00:19:16,927
- A cricket team perhaps?
- Nope!

213
00:19:17,601 --> 00:19:21,049
It's none of your business.
Not my fault if you don't know.

214
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:24,469
- Simple curiosity...
- Well, it killed the cat!

215
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,664
So, it's broken down?

216
00:19:32,928 --> 00:19:35,481
- It looks...
- Who said to leave the car?

217
00:19:35,649 --> 00:19:38,299
- My friend Georges.
- I'm in a hurry!

218
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:41,279
- Crap!
- See you.

219
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,262
No-one says "See you" now.

220
00:20:02,272 --> 00:20:04,215
Come in for a drink.

221
00:20:04,384 --> 00:20:06,937
No, no, no!
Let's get one thing straight.

222
00:20:07,296 --> 00:20:10,110
I only picked you up
as a favor, OK?

223
00:20:10,271 --> 00:20:12,475
We're not going to stay
best friends.

224
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,003
- Fab to see you.
- Yeah...

225
00:20:15,168 --> 00:20:17,056
- Great.
- No-one says "fab" now.

226
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:22,109
- I'll call you, yeah?
- Think about it, then call me, OK?

227
00:20:22,177 --> 00:20:24,598
- No, you call me.
- Whatever. Good luck.

228
00:20:26,463 --> 00:20:27,838
Bye, Georges!

229
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,321
Thanks!

230
00:20:57,887 --> 00:20:59,513
I'm here!

231
00:21:04,128 --> 00:21:05,502
I'm home!

232
00:21:10,016 --> 00:21:11,926
I'm here! Mom!

233
00:21:13,344 --> 00:21:14,424
Kevin!

234
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:18,173
Where is he?

235
00:21:20,191 --> 00:21:21,849
Are you downstairs?

236
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,061
Mom...

237
00:21:26,655 --> 00:21:27,866
I'm hungry!

238
00:21:28,768 --> 00:21:30,873
I'm really, really hungry!

239
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,077
Why's that there?

240
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,057
<i>Dear Blaise,</i>

241
00:21:52,831 --> 00:21:56,955
<i>Since your confinement,</i>
<i>our life has been a nightmare.</i>

242
00:21:58,143 --> 00:22:00,314
<i>Our friends turned their backs</i>
<i>on us.</i>

243
00:22:00,671 --> 00:22:04,249
<i>People in the street</i>
<i>point and spit at us.</i>

244
00:22:05,311 --> 00:22:07,766
<i>Your sister stopped school</i>
<i>3 months ago</i>

245
00:22:08,095 --> 00:22:10,332
<i>due to the pressure she's under.</i>

246
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,717
<i>Your father was laid off</i>
<i>at once</i>

247
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,341
<i>and hasn't changed</i>
<i>his shirt since.</i>

248
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:20,056
<i>He's lost his appetite for life.</i>

249
00:22:21,824 --> 00:22:25,402
<i>As for me, I lost</i>
<i>my natural taste for housework</i>

250
00:22:25,728 --> 00:22:29,110
<i>and tried several times</i>
<i>to end it all.</i>

251
00:22:29,409 --> 00:22:30,488
I see.

252
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,869
<i>That's why we decided</i>
<i>to leave here</i>

253
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:38,395
<i>and start over somewhere else</i>

254
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:41,534
<i>far from all this, far from you.</i>

255
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,535
<i>I hope you'll understand.</i>

256
00:22:45,503 --> 00:22:48,699
<i>Don't try to find us.</i>
<i>Take care of the house.</i>

257
00:22:49,407 --> 00:22:50,684
<i>Best regards, Mom.</i>

258
00:22:59,487 --> 00:23:00,470
6...

259
00:23:05,312 --> 00:23:06,391
Home!

260
00:23:18,912 --> 00:23:20,570
Who'll wash me?

261
00:23:20,736 --> 00:23:22,143
Who'll wash me?

262
00:23:27,775 --> 00:23:29,717
I can sleep, it's OK!

263
00:23:29,887 --> 00:23:31,480
I'm sleeping!

264
00:23:31,903 --> 00:23:33,790
I can sleep, I can sleep.

265
00:24:29,215 --> 00:24:30,143
Chivers!

266
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:32,408
So, how did you end the night?

267
00:24:33,566 --> 00:24:34,940
With that brunette.

268
00:24:35,103 --> 00:24:36,478
- The Greek.
- Yeah.

269
00:24:36,638 --> 00:24:38,045
Great!

270
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:40,220
But she had natural breasts.

271
00:24:41,853 --> 00:24:44,376
Sorry. I mean, that's rough.

272
00:24:44,543 --> 00:24:47,194
I nearly hurled.
I left her with her shirt open.

273
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:49,145
How embarrassing!

274
00:24:53,343 --> 00:24:55,230
- What's next?
- Russian.

275
00:24:55,391 --> 00:24:57,660
- Or chemistry.
- Bad news!

276
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,549
- Haven't you heard?
- No.

277
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:12,312
He landed a natural!

278
00:25:12,478 --> 00:25:14,551
What? A real natural?

279
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,854
Just the breasts. I groped 'em.

280
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,556
That's bad enough.

281
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:21,086
So, what does it feel like?

282
00:25:21,566 --> 00:25:22,459
Nothing.

283
00:25:22,623 --> 00:25:25,469
Soft, silky... Very unpleasant.

284
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,037
How embarrassing!

285
00:25:33,374 --> 00:25:34,683
Come here. What's that?

286
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:36,155
What?

287
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,121
Why's your jacket bobbling?

288
00:25:40,287 --> 00:25:41,431
I don't know.

289
00:25:41,598 --> 00:25:44,183
My mother
must have washed it wrong.

290
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:48,599
Don't you look in the mirror
in the morning?

291
00:25:49,534 --> 00:25:51,423
- What have I told you?
- Yeah.

292
00:25:51,744 --> 00:25:53,630
- Chivers...
- Yeah.

293
00:25:54,494 --> 00:25:55,388
Chivers, what?

294
00:25:55,551 --> 00:25:58,398
"...must be perfect inside
and out."

295
00:26:00,095 --> 00:26:01,436
So...

296
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:03,289
You fix that by tomorrow.

297
00:26:16,671 --> 00:26:17,686
Let's go.

298
00:26:17,854 --> 00:26:20,724
- Your jacket's bobbling.
- Yeah, I know.

299
00:26:31,774 --> 00:26:34,558
Hey, guys, wait for me!

300
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:38,046
Wait up!

301
00:26:38,462 --> 00:26:39,444
Max!

302
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,110
No, look.

303
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:52,859
Sorry.

304
00:26:53,022 --> 00:26:56,088
- I won't show you every day.
- I got it now.

305
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:07,285
In Figure 2.9, a solution
is separated from its solvent

306
00:27:07,903 --> 00:27:10,750
by a membrane that is
permeable

307
00:27:10,909 --> 00:27:13,146
only to the solvent.

308
00:27:13,566 --> 00:27:16,184
Solvent molecules will pass

309
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,317
through the solvent membrane
to the solution...

310
00:29:16,446 --> 00:29:17,526
Get down here!

311
00:30:20,638 --> 00:30:23,540
Jesus, look at that dumb beardie
takin' it easy!

312
00:30:23,709 --> 00:30:25,684
- What beardie?
- That beardie!

313
00:30:25,853 --> 00:30:27,162
Punish him!

314
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:29,240
Stay here. I'll sort him out.

315
00:30:44,861 --> 00:30:47,415
Hey, Jim Morrison,
you OK on my fender?

316
00:30:47,581 --> 00:30:50,200
- I'm just leaning on it.
- "Just leaning"!

317
00:30:51,453 --> 00:30:53,395
You're annoying me.
Stand up.

318
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:56,442
Not so cocky now, eh?

319
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,459
You sweating in all that hair?

320
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,443
No? And now?

321
00:31:00,604 --> 00:31:02,296
- No.
- Bet your back's hairy!

322
00:31:02,813 --> 00:31:04,155
- Go on, admit it!
- Yep.

323
00:31:04,221 --> 00:31:05,236
I knew it!

324
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:08,437
You disgust me,
filthy, reactionary pig!

325
00:31:09,918 --> 00:31:11,827
And that! What's that?

326
00:31:12,605 --> 00:31:13,653
- A book.
- A book!

327
00:31:13,821 --> 00:31:15,576
Get with it!

328
00:31:15,805 --> 00:31:17,211
You rebelling?

329
00:31:17,821 --> 00:31:19,544
Stop it! You're hurting!

330
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:22,392
- Let's help him.
- It's too embarrassing.

331
00:31:23,453 --> 00:31:26,420
- Say sorry.
- Sorry, but I was only joking.

332
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,883
Cut the crap!
Apologize in German.

333
00:31:29,214 --> 00:31:31,122
I do Russian, not German.

334
00:31:31,294 --> 00:31:32,439
I said, in German!

335
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:34,738
Ach, so! How's that?

336
00:31:35,452 --> 00:31:36,697
Loser!

337
00:31:37,181 --> 00:31:40,083
You and your pals think
you're the best?

338
00:31:41,085 --> 00:31:42,578
You make me puke!

339
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:46,555
Hey, cutie,
who makes you puke? Us?

340
00:31:47,133 --> 00:31:48,693
Guys, we make Fatso puke!

341
00:31:50,012 --> 00:31:52,434
The frying pan's calling
the kettle black!

342
00:31:52,605 --> 00:31:54,198
That's not the expression.

343
00:31:55,772 --> 00:31:57,496
Bunch of assholes!

344
00:31:57,662 --> 00:31:59,254
Don't mess with the Chivers!

345
00:31:59,421 --> 00:32:01,788
Look at that fag running away!

346
00:32:02,108 --> 00:32:03,702
Get up!
You're embarrassing us!

347
00:32:04,284 --> 00:32:05,430
Sorry.

348
00:32:05,916 --> 00:32:09,049
- I nearly slit his throat!
- Get cleaned up.

349
00:32:09,213 --> 00:32:11,188
Watch how you look, dammit!

350
00:32:14,686 --> 00:32:15,961
Let's hit the road.

351
00:32:16,285 --> 00:32:17,659
- Your milk.
- Oh, yeah.

352
00:32:21,212 --> 00:32:23,602
The last one there
is a Phil Collins fan!

353
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,347
Is it me?

354
00:33:07,324 --> 00:33:10,171
What a couple of little kids!
Pathetic!

355
00:33:24,989 --> 00:33:27,126
You the guy who killed
3 teenagers?

356
00:33:28,445 --> 00:33:29,971
Yes... No, no!

357
00:33:30,877 --> 00:33:33,462
I recognized you.
I was fascinated by you.

358
00:33:33,628 --> 00:33:35,831
- It's not me.
- I knew one of them.

359
00:33:36,316 --> 00:33:37,461
I'll never forget it.

360
00:33:37,627 --> 00:33:39,222
Can I have an autograph?

361
00:33:39,388 --> 00:33:42,290
I'm cool.
I just want an autograph.

362
00:33:43,836 --> 00:33:46,453
I'm Bruno. Put "To Bruno".

363
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,961
Alright.

364
00:33:52,988 --> 00:33:56,468
Please don't judge me
by my writing.

365
00:33:58,716 --> 00:34:01,302
Oh, thank you.
All the best, man.

366
00:34:01,467 --> 00:34:02,515
Thanks.

367
00:34:02,684 --> 00:34:05,018
By the way,
they're bothering me...

368
00:34:45,308 --> 00:34:47,577
"Chivers must be perfect
indoors and out."

369
00:34:47,741 --> 00:34:51,253
"Chivers must be perfect
indoors and out." Got it!

370
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,970
Hey, I don't like Phil Collins!

371
00:35:15,932 --> 00:35:17,590
I never did!

372
00:35:18,587 --> 00:35:19,733
Coming.

373
00:35:21,147 --> 00:35:22,576
OK, first round.

374
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:25,617
Max is the batterer.

375
00:35:25,979 --> 00:35:27,256
Received. I accept.

376
00:35:29,885 --> 00:35:31,292
Ready...

377
00:35:31,451 --> 00:35:32,564
The game is blue.

378
00:35:32,892 --> 00:35:34,234
- Blue!
- Blue!

379
00:35:34,972 --> 00:35:37,623
- What's blue?
- Only the batterer scores.

380
00:35:37,787 --> 00:35:39,861
- Are you the batterer?
- He is.

381
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:41,941
Blue!

382
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,242
Ready... Georges, in position!

383
00:35:56,764 --> 00:35:58,193
The mystery...

384
00:35:59,964 --> 00:36:02,167
is 115 less 15.

385
00:36:09,115 --> 00:36:10,360
Me!

386
00:36:13,723 --> 00:36:14,672
100!

387
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,355
Indeed.

388
00:36:20,795 --> 00:36:22,170
OK, back in position.

389
00:36:22,524 --> 00:36:23,538
C'mon!

390
00:36:31,483 --> 00:36:32,825
The mystery...

391
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:36,179
is 523 plus 412.

392
00:36:41,596 --> 00:36:43,025
Me!

393
00:36:43,611 --> 00:36:45,106
935!

394
00:36:48,731 --> 00:36:49,592
Indeed.

395
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,577
And 403 plus 202.

396
00:36:56,698 --> 00:36:57,843
Indeed.

397
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,293
And 620 plus 413.

398
00:37:02,651 --> 00:37:05,107
- 365.
- Wrong, Georges.

399
00:37:08,891 --> 00:37:11,095
54 plus 23.

400
00:37:11,611 --> 00:37:12,626
1,640.

401
00:37:13,852 --> 00:37:14,996
Indeed.

402
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:19,412
- You're the batterer.
- What do I do?

403
00:37:19,611 --> 00:37:20,625
Do I throw the ball?

404
00:37:21,211 --> 00:37:23,415
Hit the one who says
the answer.

405
00:37:24,668 --> 00:37:25,976
42!

406
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:29,209
You OK?

407
00:37:40,346 --> 00:37:41,809
OK, ready.

408
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,123
- Who's that guy?
- I don't know.

409
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:49,562
Boot!

410
00:37:49,691 --> 00:37:51,992
- Know him?
- No. Let's play.

411
00:37:53,019 --> 00:37:56,434
- He said, "Georges, boot".
- Really? He's crazy!

412
00:37:56,763 --> 00:37:57,843
Get rid of him.

413
00:37:58,012 --> 00:38:00,312
- Why me?
- He's calling you.

414
00:38:04,538 --> 00:38:06,744
You OK, Georges? Boot!

415
00:38:08,186 --> 00:38:09,648
Do you mind, mister?

416
00:38:09,819 --> 00:38:11,445
We're playing a game.

417
00:38:11,771 --> 00:38:13,048
- OK...
- Why are you here?

418
00:38:13,755 --> 00:38:15,064
- Scram!
- Why?

419
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,397
I don't wanna be seen with you.

420
00:38:17,563 --> 00:38:19,450
- I'm with my buddies.
- So?

421
00:38:19,771 --> 00:38:21,428
- He's lost.
- No, I'm not.

422
00:38:22,076 --> 00:38:24,890
- Stop it!
- Go away. I'll explain later.

423
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:27,351
But... Stop that!

424
00:38:27,995 --> 00:38:31,344
Very well. Third right.
Goodbye, mister.

425
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:33,815
- Yeah, sure!
- Same to you.

426
00:38:34,683 --> 00:38:37,268
Turns out, he'd lost his way.

427
00:38:37,436 --> 00:38:38,134
Carry on.

428
00:38:38,299 --> 00:38:41,462
The sign's unclear.
Even I couldn't find it at first.

429
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:43,864
You've changed, Georges!

430
00:38:44,058 --> 00:38:45,268
OK, let's go.

431
00:38:45,435 --> 00:38:47,409
- Come on, guys.
- Blue.

432
00:38:47,578 --> 00:38:49,105
- Blue.
- Blue.

433
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:16,535
<i>Take me back home.</i>

434
00:39:48,955 --> 00:39:50,897
<i>That's it. Friends.</i>

435
00:39:52,377 --> 00:39:54,516
<i>Friends. Hug. That's it.</i>

436
00:39:56,091 --> 00:39:57,652
<i>OK, OK!</i>

437
00:39:58,971 --> 00:40:00,401
<i>... without thinking.</i>

438
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:03,345
<i>Quick, I said.</i>

439
00:40:05,306 --> 00:40:07,727
<i>- How long have I been here?</i>
<i>- I won't say.</i>

440
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:10,643
<i>- Find the odd one out.</i>
<i>- I won't!</i>

441
00:40:11,706 --> 00:40:12,786
<i>Cut!</i>

442
00:40:13,787 --> 00:40:15,314
<i>You're starting again.</i>

443
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:11,538
Come along.

444
00:41:15,578 --> 00:41:18,513
Good. It's looking very good.

445
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:20,977
It's not too swollen.

446
00:41:21,945 --> 00:41:23,571
Is it painful?

447
00:41:23,833 --> 00:41:26,584
- Feel anything?
- It hurts at the back.

448
00:41:26,747 --> 00:41:28,175
But I took those pills.

449
00:41:28,347 --> 00:41:29,807
Yes, they're good stuff.

450
00:41:30,234 --> 00:41:31,795
They made me a bit edgy.

451
00:41:32,474 --> 00:41:34,132
Just a bit more patience...

452
00:41:34,299 --> 00:41:36,980
Then, you'll crawl at my feet
and thank me.

453
00:41:38,554 --> 00:41:40,823
How many people died

454
00:41:41,146 --> 00:41:43,284
on the Paris - Tokyo flight

455
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:45,687
on May 7, 1985?

456
00:41:48,025 --> 00:41:49,880
It was a Boeing in March '82.

457
00:41:53,307 --> 00:41:54,648
My secretary.

458
00:41:55,002 --> 00:41:56,889
She tries to catch me out,

459
00:41:57,017 --> 00:41:59,505
but she can't.
It drives her crazy!

460
00:42:00,569 --> 00:42:01,912
One last question, Doctor.

461
00:42:02,234 --> 00:42:04,502
If I miss my old face,
then what?

462
00:42:05,466 --> 00:42:08,083
- What?
- What if I miss my old face?

463
00:42:11,258 --> 00:42:13,146
- That?
- Yes, that.

464
00:42:13,435 --> 00:42:15,442
That's finished, in the past.

465
00:42:15,963 --> 00:42:18,865
- You want to be the best?
- Yes, I do.

466
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:22,137
This is what you need, then.

467
00:42:30,009 --> 00:42:32,431
- Don't you like it?
- Oh, yes, it's...

468
00:42:35,963 --> 00:42:38,897
Don't worry, it's natural,
you're still in shock.

469
00:42:39,066 --> 00:42:41,269
Sorry.
You must think I'm ridiculous.

470
00:42:41,594 --> 00:42:43,666
Not at all. Now you go home.

471
00:42:43,834 --> 00:42:45,809
A nice cold bath, two aspirins,

472
00:42:46,138 --> 00:42:48,472
a good night's sleep, that's it.

473
00:42:49,177 --> 00:42:50,999
Don't tell anyone I fainted.

474
00:42:51,322 --> 00:42:52,434
Go on.

475
00:42:53,945 --> 00:42:56,335
- Off you go.
- Thank you, Doctor.

476
00:42:56,506 --> 00:42:58,196
Goodbye, Doctor.

477
00:42:59,065 --> 00:43:01,782
Thanks again. I mean it.

478
00:43:02,969 --> 00:43:04,247
Thank you.

479
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:08,853
What?

480
00:43:08,921 --> 00:43:11,987
Wait and see how women
treat you in a week's time.

481
00:43:12,602 --> 00:43:13,681
Thank you!

482
00:44:00,121 --> 00:44:01,496
What're you doing here?

483
00:44:01,849 --> 00:44:04,468
- What have you done?
- It's just my new face.

484
00:44:04,698 --> 00:44:06,584
Let's go inside for a minute.

485
00:44:06,745 --> 00:44:09,745
- Like in the old days.
- You don't get it.

486
00:44:11,545 --> 00:44:14,579
Listen, remember those guys
you saw yesterday?

487
00:44:15,481 --> 00:44:17,488
They're the Chivers.

488
00:44:17,785 --> 00:44:19,345
Say "Chivers".

489
00:44:19,512 --> 00:44:22,229
Right.
And I'm a Chivers now, see?

490
00:44:23,481 --> 00:44:25,654
That means I'm one of the best.

491
00:44:25,817 --> 00:44:27,988
- What am I?
- You're nothing.

492
00:44:29,369 --> 00:44:31,192
So, listen, with these guys,

493
00:44:31,353 --> 00:44:34,549
I'm on thin ice.
I could be out in under 2 seconds.

494
00:44:35,033 --> 00:44:37,302
Do you understand "out"?

495
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:39,285
- Not being inside.
- Right.

496
00:44:39,449 --> 00:44:41,937
I could be not inside
in under 2 seconds.

497
00:44:42,424 --> 00:44:45,393
That's why I can't be seen
with you. You suck.

498
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,499
You suck big time.
You suck to infinity.

499
00:44:49,913 --> 00:44:51,888
What are you implying by

500
00:44:52,217 --> 00:44:54,257
"You suck big time,
to infinity"?

501
00:44:54,426 --> 00:44:57,207
Blaise, look.
Your face isn't even redone.

502
00:44:57,657 --> 00:45:00,756
And no-one wears
those clothes now! Like your bike!

503
00:45:00,921 --> 00:45:04,117
Who has a bike like that?
Can you see any like it?

504
00:45:04,505 --> 00:45:07,286
You don't need to look!
There aren't any.

505
00:45:07,449 --> 00:45:09,751
No-one wears
those Uruguayan bracelets.

506
00:45:10,361 --> 00:45:11,096
Mexican!

507
00:45:11,288 --> 00:45:13,362
Listen, I've got a solution for you.

508
00:45:14,424 --> 00:45:16,367
You should go very far away

509
00:45:16,793 --> 00:45:18,616
to a distant country.

510
00:45:18,905 --> 00:45:21,688
An underdeveloped place
where a loser like you

511
00:45:21,848 --> 00:45:23,920
could become a king.

512
00:45:25,433 --> 00:45:26,808
D'you understand "king"?

513
00:45:28,472 --> 00:45:31,319
- Understand "king"?
- Yeah, I do.

514
00:45:31,738 --> 00:45:35,033
It takes me a while
with this new humor.

515
00:45:36,698 --> 00:45:39,217
- Well done! It worked this time.
- Listen.

516
00:45:39,513 --> 00:45:42,547
I won't tell you again.
I'm being serious, man to man.

517
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,946
This is the time to listen up.

518
00:45:45,273 --> 00:45:48,240
I don't want to see you again.
Don't come knocking.

519
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:51,405
Got that? It's over.
We go our separate ways.

520
00:45:58,329 --> 00:46:00,336
Is that new humor?

521
00:46:03,129 --> 00:46:05,616
We were like brother and sister!

522
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:20,568
We'll see who the real Chivers is!

523
00:46:24,537 --> 00:46:26,609
We'll see who the king is!

524
00:46:26,777 --> 00:46:28,663
I'm the king! A great king!

525
00:47:55,737 --> 00:47:57,459
It works.

526
00:47:57,784 --> 00:48:00,370
It hurts a bit, but it works.

527
00:48:03,576 --> 00:48:04,591
Not that!

528
00:48:34,233 --> 00:48:35,542
Show me.

529
00:48:37,592 --> 00:48:38,999
That's not bad.

530
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,588
- Good start.
- Really? You like it?

531
00:48:41,753 --> 00:48:43,280
It's better than it was.

532
00:48:43,447 --> 00:48:45,007
You should fix the chin.

533
00:48:45,305 --> 00:48:48,981
I don't like the temples.
You can see the bone structure.

534
00:48:49,144 --> 00:48:50,191
Do you like it?

535
00:48:50,359 --> 00:48:53,077
I don't know anymore.
The bone?

536
00:48:53,528 --> 00:48:54,543
Structure.

537
00:48:55,416 --> 00:48:56,911
So, Georges...

538
00:48:58,905 --> 00:49:00,760
You're now a Chivers.

539
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,847
- Thanks for having me.
- You're a lucky guy.

540
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:07,761
I know. I'm really touched.
Chivers.

541
00:49:09,303 --> 00:49:10,798
Hey, that reminds me.

542
00:49:12,215 --> 00:49:13,775
Forgotten something?

543
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:16,880
- Isn't today the 15th?
- Oh, yeah.

544
00:51:40,791 --> 00:51:41,686
Boot.

545
00:51:42,775 --> 00:51:44,563
Who are you? Beat it!

546
00:51:46,454 --> 00:51:48,397
No... How are you doing?

547
00:51:50,071 --> 00:51:52,494
Know who I am?
I said, beat it!

548
00:51:52,792 --> 00:51:55,542
I know who you are.
I know exactly who you are.

549
00:51:55,992 --> 00:51:58,741
I'm a bit like you.
Look what I did to my face.

550
00:51:59,031 --> 00:52:01,682
- I'm not a homo!
- Nor am I.

551
00:52:01,943 --> 00:52:04,627
What kind of trap is this?

552
00:52:05,239 --> 00:52:06,669
Who are you?

553
00:52:07,095 --> 00:52:09,942
- Don't you recognize me?
- My pal, the monkey!

554
00:52:10,358 --> 00:52:11,307
OK, alright!

555
00:52:12,406 --> 00:52:13,814
You keep out of this.

556
00:52:13,976 --> 00:52:15,405
You didn't see a thing.

557
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,774
I did! I saw!

558
00:52:18,679 --> 00:52:20,501
See to your homo pal there!

559
00:52:20,663 --> 00:52:21,612
I want you!

560
00:52:22,007 --> 00:52:24,494
Hey, I got a penknife!
A freakin' penknife!

561
00:52:24,662 --> 00:52:26,834
Look what I can do! Let go!

562
00:52:26,999 --> 00:52:28,722
Let go of him!

563
00:52:29,143 --> 00:52:31,478
Or I'll do something stupid!

564
00:52:31,671 --> 00:52:33,165
I'll count to 5.

565
00:52:33,463 --> 00:52:34,476
One...

566
00:52:42,806 --> 00:52:44,695
Beat it! You too!

567
00:52:45,527 --> 00:52:47,087
Go on. Scram.

568
00:52:48,951 --> 00:52:50,413
What'll you have?

569
00:52:51,446 --> 00:52:53,235
Water with small ice cubes.

570
00:52:53,399 --> 00:52:54,609
Not big ones.

571
00:52:55,991 --> 00:52:57,037
A magnum!

572
00:52:58,519 --> 00:53:00,176
So, what's your name?

573
00:53:00,664 --> 00:53:01,645
Blaise.

574
00:53:02,839 --> 00:53:04,017
Shit name.

575
00:53:04,503 --> 00:53:05,748
I'll call you Chuck.

576
00:53:06,007 --> 00:53:08,395
- OK, Chuck, I'm Dan.
- Alright, Dan.

577
00:53:08,791 --> 00:53:09,838
Boot.

578
00:53:10,326 --> 00:53:11,635
Hey, wow!

579
00:53:11,798 --> 00:53:13,740
I like that staple job.

580
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:15,602
Is it new?

581
00:53:16,023 --> 00:53:18,356
I did it at home, in fact.

582
00:53:18,518 --> 00:53:19,696
I love it.

583
00:53:20,663 --> 00:53:22,997
- It takes 20 minutes.
- Very bold.

584
00:53:23,447 --> 00:53:25,204
Thanks. Bibi, meet Chuck.

585
00:53:25,367 --> 00:53:26,774
- Hi, Chuck.
- Blaise.

586
00:53:26,934 --> 00:53:28,365
Blaise usually.

587
00:53:31,158 --> 00:53:33,548
C'mon, Chuck, you gotta drink!

588
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:36,655
I got it.

589
00:53:52,214 --> 00:53:53,108
Stop it!

590
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:54,514
- Why are you here?
- What?

591
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:56,049
- Trying to oust me?
- No.

592
00:53:56,214 --> 00:53:59,181
So, why are you here?
Didn't I say, go far away?

593
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:01,771
To another country?
See another gang?

594
00:54:03,382 --> 00:54:04,593
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

595
00:54:04,759 --> 00:54:06,253
- What?
- Something.

596
00:54:06,583 --> 00:54:08,852
- Did you say you knew me?
- Dunno. Bye.

597
00:54:09,015 --> 00:54:10,421
- Stay here!
- What?

598
00:54:10,583 --> 00:54:12,818
You'll never be a Chivers,
you peasant!

599
00:54:13,431 --> 00:54:14,674
No-one says "peasant".

600
00:54:14,967 --> 00:54:17,486
You're mad
that I'm now a Chivers.

601
00:54:18,007 --> 00:54:20,624
Stop drinking that.
I know you hate milk.

602
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:23,638
- You just want to be like us.
- I love it!

603
00:54:24,022 --> 00:54:24,970
I'm a Chivers!

604
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:29,263
If I see you hanging around
my gang, I'll kill you, OK?

605
00:54:46,774 --> 00:54:48,084
Where were you?

606
00:54:48,406 --> 00:54:50,959
- I went for some fresh air.
- Yeah?

607
00:54:51,734 --> 00:54:53,075
You often do that?

608
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:56,301
- It was the first time.
- I wonder why.

609
00:55:02,326 --> 00:55:03,733
Blow on me.

610
00:55:04,022 --> 00:55:06,193
- Why should I?
- Do as I say.

611
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:09,259
- What's wrong with you?
- Hurry up and blow.

612
00:55:09,621 --> 00:55:12,111
- Ridiculous!
- Hurry up!

613
00:55:12,695 --> 00:55:15,084
With your mouth, not your nose.

614
00:55:18,262 --> 00:55:20,913
- You doing it on purpose?
- What's the point?

615
00:55:21,175 --> 00:55:22,668
Blow on me.

616
00:55:26,806 --> 00:55:27,504
What?

617
00:55:28,374 --> 00:55:30,283
Come on, get over here!

618
00:55:32,566 --> 00:55:34,453
You made fun of us, huh?

619
00:55:34,711 --> 00:55:36,750
You sure made fun of us!

620
00:55:38,551 --> 00:55:41,104
I knew we couldn't trust you!

621
00:55:42,295 --> 00:55:44,433
Where do you hide 'em?
Where?

622
00:55:45,141 --> 00:55:46,996
- What?
- You know what!

623
00:55:47,158 --> 00:55:49,067
Show me where you hide 'em!

624
00:55:49,397 --> 00:55:51,404
C'mon, show me!

625
00:55:51,798 --> 00:55:54,099
You've got 'em!
I'll find 'em!

626
00:56:01,334 --> 00:56:02,643
Hey, guys!

627
00:56:02,838 --> 00:56:04,660
He's totally crazy!

628
00:56:04,886 --> 00:56:06,446
There we are!

629
00:56:06,614 --> 00:56:08,752
What's this, then? And this?

630
00:56:08,919 --> 00:56:10,827
- Cigarettes!
- I don't smoke.

631
00:56:11,254 --> 00:56:13,644
This guy's a traitor!
What's this, then?

632
00:56:13,813 --> 00:56:14,893
They're not mine!

633
00:56:15,157 --> 00:56:16,651
- Punish him!
- Scumbag!

634
00:56:16,822 --> 00:56:18,383
Chain smoker!

635
00:56:23,606 --> 00:56:24,620
Gross!

636
00:56:25,429 --> 00:56:28,113
You smoke? So, smoke this!

637
00:56:28,534 --> 00:56:31,185
- Chain smoker!
- You're not a Chivers!

638
00:56:32,501 --> 00:56:33,876
You hear me?

639
00:56:56,853 --> 00:57:00,203
Money for a face lift.
For a face lift...

640
00:57:00,853 --> 00:57:02,282
Money for a face lift...

641
00:57:02,453 --> 00:57:04,396
Thank you, sir!

642
00:57:14,229 --> 00:57:16,716
Spare a dime for a face lift!

643
00:57:36,309 --> 00:57:38,731
Stop! Stop the machine!

644
00:57:38,902 --> 00:57:41,236
Give me some money now!

645
00:57:42,069 --> 00:57:43,497
- I don't have much.
- What?

646
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:45,491
I don't have much.

647
00:57:48,758 --> 00:57:49,620
Thank you.

648
00:58:02,165 --> 00:58:03,824
Wanna make some money?

649
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:08,266
What've I done?
I've done nothing.

650
00:58:08,436 --> 00:58:09,747
- Wanna make some money?
- What?

651
00:58:10,102 --> 00:58:11,924
Wanna make some money?

652
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:14,608
I wanna... Yes, why?

653
00:58:20,022 --> 00:58:22,836
I can't do it! It won't catch!

654
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:26,127
C'mon!

655
00:58:27,062 --> 00:58:29,581
No, but the paint... It's all...

656
00:58:29,748 --> 00:58:30,764
Force it!

657
00:58:30,933 --> 00:58:32,690
I'll scratch the...

658
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:35,088
Calm down and force it.

659
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:39,381
You say right, I go right...

660
00:58:39,542 --> 00:58:40,949
Out of the way!

661
00:58:45,877 --> 00:58:47,469
A little movement...

662
00:58:48,534 --> 00:58:50,672
- Get in.
- Oh, we're stealing it?

663
00:58:50,837 --> 00:58:52,178
Yes, hurry up.

664
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:02,608
With a Japanese car,
I'd do it in 4 seconds.

665
00:59:04,693 --> 00:59:06,416
Careful though...

666
00:59:06,677 --> 00:59:08,979
It might take me 10 this time.

667
00:59:11,508 --> 00:59:13,035
Go on, count.

668
00:59:14,869 --> 00:59:16,276
One...

669
00:59:16,822 --> 00:59:18,545
- Count.
- Two...

670
00:59:19,829 --> 00:59:21,291
Three...

671
00:59:21,461 --> 00:59:22,868
Hang on!

672
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:24,788
Mechanical trouble?

673
00:59:25,109 --> 00:59:27,531
No, I'm just performing
fellatio on him.

674
00:59:28,341 --> 00:59:29,999
Have a nice day.

675
00:59:32,597 --> 00:59:33,807
Five...

676
00:59:38,869 --> 00:59:39,884
Eight...

677
00:59:42,133 --> 00:59:44,523
- OK, see you there.
- What about you?

678
00:59:44,693 --> 00:59:47,148
- I'll go in my chair.
- OK, see you.

679
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:49,901
Let's go.

680
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:52,779
- Take that one.
- That one?

681
01:01:26,868 --> 01:01:27,850
Yes?

682
01:01:28,212 --> 01:01:30,382
<i>Mom, someone put me in a car.</i>

683
01:01:30,549 --> 01:01:33,199
What?
Laura, who put you in a car?

684
01:01:34,069 --> 01:01:36,403
A man in a wheelchair.

685
01:01:36,533 --> 01:01:39,282
- An electric chair.
- An electric chair.

686
01:01:39,573 --> 01:01:41,613
<i>- Wheelchair or electric chair?</i>
- Both.

687
01:01:41,812 --> 01:01:43,569
You're incoherent. Put him on.

688
01:01:45,429 --> 01:01:46,738
It's my mother.

689
01:01:51,155 --> 01:01:53,491
<i>What is all this? Who are you?</i>

690
01:01:53,653 --> 01:01:55,692
My friend's kidnapped Laura.

691
01:01:56,277 --> 01:01:58,316
This better be a joke.

692
01:01:58,484 --> 01:01:59,662
<i>I'm afraid not.</i>

693
01:01:59,925 --> 01:02:02,477
I want to reassure you,
he isn't a pervert.

694
01:02:02,805 --> 01:02:05,706
<i>He's a very gentle man</i>
<i>who just needs money.</i>

695
01:02:06,036 --> 01:02:07,978
OK, put your friend on.

696
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:10,545
- She wants you.
- No, I'm not here.

697
01:02:11,028 --> 01:02:12,369
- She's nice.
- You talk.

698
01:02:12,691 --> 01:02:14,066
Go on, she's nice.

699
01:02:22,964 --> 01:02:25,812
<i>- No-one says "Hello" now.</i>
- Oh, sorry.

700
01:02:25,876 --> 01:02:27,304
How much do you want?

701
01:02:27,477 --> 01:02:29,200
<i>How much? Uh, hang on.</i>

702
01:02:30,292 --> 01:02:33,391
I dunno... Enough to buy an SUV,
get a face lift...

703
01:02:34,067 --> 01:02:35,083
I see.

704
01:02:36,275 --> 01:02:38,796
I finish my piano lesson at 5.

705
01:02:38,965 --> 01:02:41,266
Meet me at school.
I'll have the cash.

706
01:02:42,069 --> 01:02:43,246
- OK.
<i>- Be on time.</i>

707
01:02:48,052 --> 01:02:50,671
- So?
- It's OK.

708
01:02:51,316 --> 01:02:53,259
We got the money and the meet.

709
01:02:53,428 --> 01:02:54,954
See? Easy, isn't it?

710
01:02:56,692 --> 01:02:57,488
Thank you.

711
01:03:34,804 --> 01:03:35,884
We're here!

712
01:03:45,428 --> 01:03:46,444
Ma'am!

713
01:03:47,796 --> 01:03:49,290
I'll wait over there.

714
01:03:49,621 --> 01:03:51,082
I'll wait by the car.

715
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:02,958
"The little racsel... rascal

716
01:04:03,282 --> 01:04:06,316
escaped," Nicholas smiled.

717
01:04:07,539 --> 01:04:10,410
"They must be looking...

718
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:13,100
Iooking for her," said Caputine.

719
01:04:13,939 --> 01:04:15,150
Capucine.

720
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:17,707
"We must take her back,"
said Teacher.

721
01:04:17,876 --> 01:04:19,436
Too fast. I'm reading.

722
01:04:19,603 --> 01:04:22,735
- "Can we go..."
- "...visit her?"

723
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:24,682
I'm reading it!

724
01:04:24,851 --> 01:04:26,825
"To see if she's alright."

725
01:04:26,995 --> 01:04:28,074
Stop it!

726
01:04:28,403 --> 01:04:30,259
There's your mom!

727
01:04:33,524 --> 01:04:34,985
I'm not pleased, Laura.

728
01:04:35,316 --> 01:04:37,356
That's the last time
you walk home.

729
01:04:37,811 --> 01:04:40,626
- It wasn't my fault.
- We'll discuss it later.

730
01:04:40,788 --> 01:04:42,446
Hello. OK?

731
01:04:43,059 --> 01:04:44,074
There.

732
01:04:46,035 --> 01:04:48,490
- See what you cost me?
- I did nothing.

733
01:04:48,659 --> 01:04:50,447
- It's not her fault.
- It is.

734
01:04:50,611 --> 01:04:53,362
- It's not.
- You'll go to boarding school.

735
01:04:53,651 --> 01:04:55,593
No, not boarding school!

736
01:04:55,763 --> 01:04:58,797
Stop shouting.
Go wait in the car.

737
01:04:59,348 --> 01:05:00,427
Run along.

738
01:05:00,691 --> 01:05:01,935
I'll turn a blind eye.

739
01:05:04,116 --> 01:05:06,865
- Why do you want a face lift?
- Because.

740
01:05:07,027 --> 01:05:09,449
- You're not bad.
- That's cruel!

741
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:15,819
Let's go.

742
01:05:20,692 --> 01:05:22,513
Why don't you come for tea?

743
01:05:22,676 --> 01:05:24,651
What? Nonsense! No!

744
01:05:27,028 --> 01:05:28,401
Stop it!

745
01:05:28,563 --> 01:05:30,701
Crazy! She's crazy! Witch!

746
01:05:30,866 --> 01:05:33,168
She's turning me on...

747
01:07:27,796 --> 01:07:30,251
<i>19 days later</i>

748
01:07:56,755 --> 01:07:57,868
I'll change modes.

749
01:08:03,347 --> 01:08:04,720
Lift and hit.

750
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:06,762
Look.

751
01:08:07,826 --> 01:08:10,127
There you go. My, oh my!

752
01:08:10,258 --> 01:08:11,632
Look, it's almost split.

753
01:08:27,923 --> 01:08:29,810
- OK, Dan?
- OK, Chuck?

754
01:08:34,836 --> 01:08:36,657
Good to see you, Chuck.

755
01:08:47,603 --> 01:08:49,577
- Looking good.
- Feeling good!

756
01:08:49,970 --> 01:08:51,148
How goes it?

757
01:08:51,314 --> 01:08:52,721
No-one says that now!

758
01:08:59,507 --> 01:09:00,455
Do it quicker.

759
01:09:02,002 --> 01:09:03,661
- How you doing?
- Great.

760
01:09:03,827 --> 01:09:04,939
Hey, Serge!

761
01:09:06,322 --> 01:09:08,494
- Love the sounds.
- I just made it up.

762
01:09:10,546 --> 01:09:12,488
The other guy plucks up courage,

763
01:09:12,657 --> 01:09:14,632
goes back into the pharmacy...

764
01:09:15,729 --> 01:09:17,224
No, wait for the end!

765
01:09:17,490 --> 01:09:19,630
He goes back for the 3rd time.

766
01:09:19,922 --> 01:09:22,190
The pharmacist sees him coming

767
01:09:22,514 --> 01:09:25,449
and says, "What now?"
He stares at her

768
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:28,935
and says, "This time,
I've swallowed the whole box!"

769
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:33,836
Funny, isn't it?

770
01:09:34,866 --> 01:09:35,913
I've got one.

771
01:09:38,514 --> 01:09:39,790
I've got one!

772
01:09:41,588 --> 01:09:43,496
Look up. What do you see?

773
01:09:45,298 --> 01:09:46,246
Clouds?

774
01:09:48,722 --> 01:09:50,957
Don't they look like... fabric?

775
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:57,068
Gotcha!

776
01:09:57,234 --> 01:09:59,176
Gotcha! Gotcha!

777
01:10:03,058 --> 01:10:04,815
I just don't care, me!

778
01:10:06,162 --> 01:10:07,143
Fabric!

779
01:10:18,866 --> 01:10:20,360
What's wrong?

780
01:10:20,626 --> 01:10:21,803
You're absent.

781
01:10:22,002 --> 01:10:24,206
Relax, you're all stiff.

782
01:10:24,562 --> 01:10:25,575
Come on.

783
01:10:29,843 --> 01:10:32,362
I feel like I'm kissing a tree!

784
01:10:33,394 --> 01:10:34,604
I'm bored.

785
01:10:35,474 --> 01:10:36,521
Bored?

786
01:10:37,203 --> 01:10:38,151
What the...

787
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:43,664
Max?

788
01:11:10,322 --> 01:11:11,729
Won't it go rusty?

789
01:11:11,889 --> 01:11:14,278
Are you kidding?
That's the point!

790
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:15,759
The rust! Go on, Chuck.

791
01:11:16,082 --> 01:11:17,129
C'mon!

792
01:11:19,281 --> 01:11:20,361
There!

793
01:11:21,745 --> 01:11:23,720
- Chivers!
- I like it! Lots!

794
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:25,008
My turn!

795
01:11:26,705 --> 01:11:28,330
Do mine real big, OK?

796
01:11:29,937 --> 01:11:31,366
Here goes...

797
01:11:32,530 --> 01:11:34,188
- Great!
- Go on.

798
01:11:38,034 --> 01:11:39,495
I didn't feel a thing.

799
01:11:39,954 --> 01:11:41,645
I'm out of staples.

800
01:11:42,322 --> 01:11:43,751
Just a sec.

801
01:12:16,754 --> 01:12:18,445
I knew it! I smelled him!

802
01:12:18,610 --> 01:12:19,886
You Chivers OK?

803
01:12:20,242 --> 01:12:21,387
Having fun?

804
01:12:22,321 --> 01:12:23,401
What're you doing?

805
01:12:23,570 --> 01:12:25,196
I asked first.

806
01:12:25,426 --> 01:12:27,084
You having fun?

807
01:12:27,762 --> 01:12:28,972
We won't tell you!

808
01:12:29,137 --> 01:12:31,559
- Yeah, we are.
- Why did you tell him?

809
01:12:32,466 --> 01:12:34,604
You're a joke, you Chivers!

810
01:12:36,593 --> 01:12:38,283
He's provoking us.

811
01:12:43,026 --> 01:12:44,302
Put that cigarette down.

812
01:12:44,625 --> 01:12:45,770
It's unbearable.

813
01:12:47,506 --> 01:12:49,131
We can't just let him smoke.

814
01:12:52,913 --> 01:12:54,735
I've been thinking about you lot

815
01:12:54,928 --> 01:12:55,911
and actually,

816
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,390
you're losers!

817
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:01,966
Don't move, bitch!

818
01:13:03,537 --> 01:13:04,553
Stay there!

819
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:06,443
What's he doing?

820
01:13:07,505 --> 01:13:08,814
Look, it doesn't work.

821
01:13:08,978 --> 01:13:10,318
It does!

822
01:13:14,224 --> 01:13:15,686
It worked this morning.

823
01:13:15,857 --> 01:13:17,068
Shut up, it works!

824
01:13:19,473 --> 01:13:21,545
- Forget it!
- It's OK, Chuck!

825
01:13:24,114 --> 01:13:25,391
Shit!

826
01:13:35,697 --> 01:13:36,874
Drink some milk!

827
01:14:57,778 --> 01:15:00,198
You go that way, I'll go this way.

828
01:15:00,945 --> 01:15:02,603
- Good luck.
- Wait! Why?

829
01:15:04,752 --> 01:15:05,997
Gotta make a decision.

830
01:15:06,161 --> 01:15:08,463
I'll go this way, you that way.

831
01:15:11,888 --> 01:15:12,903
No, wait!

832
01:15:13,489 --> 01:15:14,535
What is it?

833
01:15:15,216 --> 01:15:16,680
You go that way.

834
01:15:17,648 --> 01:15:19,242
- I'll go this way.
- Why?

835
01:15:19,537 --> 01:15:21,227
I don't trust you.

836
01:15:28,272 --> 01:15:29,679
What're you doing?

837
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,117
Beat it!

838
01:15:31,281 --> 01:15:33,736
- I'm checking...
- Go that way!

839
01:15:34,928 --> 01:15:36,422
- Go!
- OK!

840
01:15:37,264 --> 01:15:38,759
Walk that way.

841
01:15:39,218 --> 01:15:40,810
- It's not your forest.
- It is!

842
01:15:41,872 --> 01:15:43,498
Go or I'll shoot you!

843
01:15:43,601 --> 01:15:45,423
Don't threaten me!

844
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:32,265
<i>No, I'm not interested.</i>

845
01:16:32,849 --> 01:16:33,895
<i>Give me a cigarette.</i>

846
01:16:34,064 --> 01:16:35,471
<i>Give me a cigarette.</i>

847
01:16:40,432 --> 01:16:41,414
<i>Let go.</i>

848
01:16:45,264 --> 01:16:45,995
<i>Your hand.</i>

849
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:50,446
<i>No, the feet.</i>

850
01:16:52,592 --> 01:16:54,250
<i>Stop doing that.</i>

851
01:16:55,888 --> 01:16:57,164
<i>You do it.</i>

852
01:16:58,164 --> 01:17:08,164
