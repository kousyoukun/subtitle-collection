1
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,866
Yee-ha!

2
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:05,017
- Can't he go any faster, Jesse?
- He's goin' fast enough, Ed.

3
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,857
- You watch them people, Frank.
- Shut up, Ed!

4
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:23,035
- What about that safe?
- There ain't no safe, Ed.

5
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,537
All the money's in the strongbox
and in the cash drawers.

6
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,374
I don't believe you.
You got a safe in here some place.

7
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,003
Tell me where it is or I'm gonna
put a bullet in your brainpan.

8
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,047
Get outta there, Ed.

9
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,966
Have you gone crazy, Ed?

10
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,554
Watch it, Jesse!

11
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:47,976
Jesse!

12
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,101
How long will it take
that posse to get here?

13
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,477
There won't be one.

14
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,938
They'll go about ten miles
and get tired,

15
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,982
and go back and call the Pinkertons.

16
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,860
How come we're standin' guard?

17
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,363
'Cause every once in a while I'm wrong.

18
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,537
We'll take you upriver
to the Mimms' house.

19
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,164
Get the bullet out there.

20
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,876
You stay quiet now.

21
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,550
Come here, Ed.

22
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,774
Jesse! Jesse!

23
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,946
- Shit! What'd you do that for?
- Panickin' and shootin' innocent folks.

24
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,866
That's for goddamn
gettin' me near killed!

25
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,248
Shit, I didn't mean no harm.

26
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:37,419
You're through, Ed.
You ain't gonna ride with me no more.

27
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,217
Are you gonna take that off him?

28
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,429
I seen what you done.

29
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,974
You may be family,
but I ain't sidin' with ya.

30
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,060
You're on your own.

31
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,860
Cole, give him his cut.

32
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,508
You threw yourself away a good livin'.

33
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,053
Now listen good.

34
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:31,264
Anybody connects the Jameses
or the Youngers with that bank,...

35
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,101
..you're a dead man.

36
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,408

innocent folk half to death.

66
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:32,862
- Never liked people standin' behind me.
- Most people would be flattered.

67
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,116
Ain't often
Belle Shirley stands behind a man.

68
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,078
I reckon that's the truth.

69
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,635
Are you still askin' $15?

70
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,179
I sure am.

71
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,603
Well, ain't nothin' worth that price.

72
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:08,106
Well, I don't figure I missed much.

73
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,987
But I'll tell you what I will do.

74
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,783
I'll go twelve and a half for you,
since you're about to go broke.

75
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,285
Huh.

76
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:25,373
I only got eleven. I'll cut you for it.

77
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,876
Make your move.

78
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,605
I'll be go to hell.

79
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,654
When your luck changes,
you feel free to call on me.

80
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,243
Everybody ante up.

81
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,294
Women... I love 'em.

82
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,049
We was all in the war.

83
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:20,929
Robbin' the first Yankee bank
because we didn't know no better.

84
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,224
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

85
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:27,435
After that we was...
just in the habit.

86
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:31,690
So I guess we'll just...
keep on goin'...

87
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,944
..till they lock us up or hang us.

88
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,342
You've hardly given yourself
time enough to heal.

89
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,469
I gotta get back to things.

90
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,764
Ma needs money
to help keep the farm goin'.

91
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:10,061
I reckon your ma can keep the farm
goin' and a few more things to boot.

92
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:13,231
Well, the others
ain't no good without me.

93
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:16,025
They gotta have somebody
to make the plans.

94
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,864
But, uh... don't worry, Zee.

95
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,200
I'm comin' back for ya.

96
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,912
I thought you'd be over
with that Tebbs girl.

97
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,749
Maybe I oughta be. She's awful pretty.

98
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:35,920
If you think so. Course, every
fella round here's been to visit her.

99
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,090
I don't guess you
have that problem, Beth.

100
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,593
I have just as many visitors as I want.

101
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,929
- And you can count on it.
- Like who, for instance?

102
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,515
That's for me to know
and you to find out.

103
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,101
How can I find out,
if you won't tell me?

104
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:54,773
Jim Younger, there are some things
that a man does not ask a lady.

105
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:59,611
Beth, when you're old enough to call
yourself a lady, I'll keep that in mind.

106
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,326
Think maybe we oughta get married?
Is that what you want?

107
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:12,707
It seems that you proposed to me
durin' the war, about seven years ago.

108
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,667
That was different.

109
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,711
Except, uh...

110
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,633
..I always knew that...
you were the one.

111
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,594
I just didn't have nothin'
worked out, that's all.

112
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:27,764
That's a mouthful for Mr. Jesse James.

113
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,350
Well, it's a mouthful of truth.

114
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:33,770
What you gotta decide is if you
wanna get on the horse with me.

115
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:38,399
I'm gonna be honest about it, Zee.
I ain't gonna change the way I live.

116
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:46,241
Well, it ain't right
to try to change a person.

117
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,703
Truth is, Jesse,
I wouldn't like you any other way.

118
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,343
Next thing you know,
they'll get married and settle down.

119
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,975
First part, anyway.
He's askin' her today.

120
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,148
It doesn't go with the way he's livin'.

121
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,150
He'll be fine.

122
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,488
First gettin' shot,
then gettin' married...

123
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,449
Bad habits.

124
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:33,538
I'd like to have a white dress
and a proper weddin'.

125
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:39,544
- You want the whole county to be there.
- I do. A girl only gets married once.

126
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,565
Yah!

127
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,904
Giddyap!

128
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,916
I never was the marryin' kind, myself.

129
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,251
Kind of life I lead,
women spell trouble.

130
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,171
Footloose and fancy-free,
that's my style.

131
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:27,258
- What about you, friend?
- I ain't felt the call yet.

132
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:31,429
But if I was to meet a girl as pretty
as this one here, I could be persuaded.

133
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:36,184
I tell you something, mister. You best
watch your mouth, not look at my wife.

134
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,604
Sorry. Didn't mean no disrespect.

135
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,231
Course he didn't.
He was just being polite.

136
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,233
Hey, old man, put a cork in it a while.

137
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,195
Vernon, be polite.

138
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,803
Goddamn outlaws.

139
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,472
Vernon, why don't you
hand that over here?

140
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,433
Damn, you son of a bitch,
you're in it with 'em!

141
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,776
I would toss that shotgun away.

142
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,744
Throw down the box.

143
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,513
- You men fight for the Stars and Bars?
- Yes, sir. Proud of it.

144
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:59,684
- May I shake your hand? Bob Younger.
- George. George Arthur.

145
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:02,353
- Who were you with, George?
- General Jo Shelby.

146
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:04,605
What about you?

147
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,026
- I was with Shelby too.
- Where?

148
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,193
Cold Harbor.

149
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,572
Shelby weren't at Cold Harbor.
You're a goddamn liar!

150
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,160
- Shall I kill him?
- I would. I'd shoot the son of a bitch.

151
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:22,373
- Bob, take everything he has.
- Everything.

152
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:26,044
Let me give you a hand.
You're lucky you ain't dead.

153
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:30,339
Hope we didn't disturb you too much,
ma'am. We didn't mean no harm.

154
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,633
You scum!
Take your hands off my wife.

155
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,012
If you shut up,
maybe I won't put a bullet in you.

156
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:41,517
Forgive me, ma'am, but you could

00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,268
..you might think about
makin' an honest woman outta me.

175
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,987
- You're serious, aren't ya?
- Don't I sound it?

176
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,031
Well, you gotta be crazy.

177
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,077
I just wanna find out
what it feels like to be respectable.

178
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,496
For a while, anyway.

179
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,751
You'll never be respectable, Belle.

180
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,545
You're a whore.

181
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,673
You'll always be a whore.

182
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,804
That's why I like ya.

183
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,310

185
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:15,564
- How you been, Beth?
- Fine. Ain't you heard the news?

186
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,150
I'm engaged to Ed Miller.

187
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,860
Ed Miller?

188
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,489
He ain't no good.

189
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,950
Besides, you're too young
for all that.

190
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,577
I'm 19 on the 23rd of September.

191
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,997
I don't wanna wait around, like Zee did.

192
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,976
And I don't want you
sayin' nothin' bad about Ed...

193
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,360
..just 'cause Jesse picked on him.

194
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:39,130
A few months ago
I was pushin' you on a swing.

195
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:43,384
Well, while you was pushin',
other people was noticin'.

196
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,845
I noticed you, Beth.

197
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:54,395
You don't wanna rush into things, Beth.
You can't undo 'em later.

198
00:21:55,939 --> 00:22:00,651
I can't undo this one. Ed's already
bought land over past Russellville.

199
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,987
Besides, we told everybody.

200
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,034
There ain't much else to say, I guess.

201
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,162
Well, you can wish me a good life.

202
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,247
I wish you that.

203
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,959
What have you
gotta say for yourself, Jim?

204
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,627
Not much, Ed.

205
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,716
Be seein' you around.

206
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,560
How you been, Ed?

207
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:39,106
Well, I'm fine.
How are you doin', Clell?

208
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,485
We're gettin' on pretty good.

209
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:48,991
This is my girl here.
This is, uh... Beth Mimms.

210
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,535
- We're gettin' married.
- Oh?

211
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:56,207
I heard you two took up together.
It's good to see you, Beth.

212
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,962
I'm doin' real fine, Clell.

213
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,257
Don't miss you boys none.

214
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,642
Well, come on, Beth,
let's get to dancin'.

215
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,234
Are you scared?

216
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,696
Yeah, a little bit.

217
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,698
I expect I am.

218
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:15,786
Just walk up to 'em real steady, though.
We got nothin' to lose.

219
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,329
Yeah.

220
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:21,250
Now you let me do the talkin', Bob.
You got that?

221
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:27,047
- Say, do I look OK?
- You look fine, Charlie.

222
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:36,932
Are you Frank James?

223
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:42,771
- Who wants to know?
- Charlie Ford and his brother Bob.

224
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,982
What the hell are you boys doin' here?

225
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:50,571
- We wanna join up.
- We heard you were lookin' for new men.

226
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,282
Yeah? Where'd you hear it from?

227
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,451
Your brother.

228
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,580
There ain't a horse we can't ride,

229
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:03,709
a target we can't hit
or a bank we can't rob.

230
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:10,090
You know how it is.
It was there. It seemed easy.

231
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:13,093
We just hauled out our guns
and made off with it.

232
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,387
Up in Joplin, it was.

233
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,933
They chased us for two days.

234
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:23,771
And you know how it is,
bein' out on the trail an' all.

235
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,698
We only been out once,
but we're willin'.

236
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,663
Frank, what the hell
were we talkin' about?

237
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,414
You know...

238
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,216
Hey, Coleman Younger!

239
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,725
Come on over here and say hello.

240
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,116
Evenin', ma'am.

241
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:02,745
Looks like everybody's havin'
a real good time at this affair.

242
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,457
Well, I expect so.

243
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,627
Free drinks an' food an' all.

244
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:13,088
How come I wasn't invited?

245
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:16,133
Because you're a whore.

246
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:24,224
Yeah, well,
at least I ain't a cheap one.

247
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,730
Yah!

248
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,933
- See ya later, Jess.
- See ya, Jim.

249
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:16,360
Ain't gonna be too long,
that'll be you and me, eh, Beth?

250
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,362
I reckon.

251
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,712
I got a question for ya.

252
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,714
Fire away, Frank.

253
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,466
Fire away and fall back.

254
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,888
Have you ever been in love?

255
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:49,518
Oh, God... Yeah.

256
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,480
It's terrible. An affliction.

257
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,442
Really miserable. Nothin' but trouble.

258
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,027
It drove me crazy.

259
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:02,156
- That bad, really?
- Yeah.

260
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,160
She is wonderful.

261
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:34,581
- What the hell are you aimin' to do?
- I ain't aimin'. I'm doin' it.

262
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:49,054
- Who are ya? Jesse James?
- Hell, no. I'm Bob Younger.

263
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:53,100
Jesse James rides with the Youngers.
Now stop the damn train.

264
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,274
Don't worry.

265
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,402
We're just takin' a permanent loan
from the Rock Island payroll.

266
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,479
Yee-ha!

267
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:50,657
The Pinkerton company,
with the Union Pacific Railroad,...

268
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:54,745
..is offering a reward of $5,000 for
information leading to the arrest..

269
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,997
..of any member
of the James-Younger gang.

270
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:11,053
- Mr. Rixley?
- That's right.

271
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:14,973
Carl Reddick. New York Herald sent me
to cover the story of the Younger gang.

272
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,294
You might say I'm interested
in the same thing, Mr. Reddick.

273
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,265
What do you think your chances are
of bringin' 'em in?

274
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,191
That's an amazingly stupid question.

275
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,225
I want your sons, Mrs. Samuel.

276
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:02,145
- What do you want 'em for?
- For robbin' banks and trains, ma'am.

277
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,440
Well, you Yankees can just
turn around and head on back.

278
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,859
Sounds like you got
the wrong James family.

279
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:12,739
Yes, ma'am. I am a Yankee and
a city man. But these men are southern.

280
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:17,411
- They were with the Stars and Bars.
- So what are they chasin' my boys for?

281
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:21,707
They steal, ma'am. I'm gonna
have to go in there and look for 'em.

282
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,667
This paper gives me
the right to do that.

283
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:33,176
Things have come to a pretty place
when a widow woman...

284
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,762
..with a 15-year-old
backward baby boy...

285
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,598
..gets treated like this
and they call it legal!

286
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,642
I am sorry, ma'am.

287
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,442
How come I never been asked?

288
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,611
Maybe you ain't cut out for it.

289
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,740
Besides, we got enough hands
the way it is.

290
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:58,702
Keep me in mind. I can rob banks as
good as the Millers or your brother Bob.

291
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:01,121
- Ain't nothin' to it.
- Think so?

292
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:06,209
What's to know about robbin' a bank?
You ride into town, guns blazin',...

293
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:09,421
..scarin' the Jesus
out of everyone until they're frozen,...

294
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:12,841
..ride right in the bank on your horse,
dynamite the safe...

295
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,611
..and ride off with the loot,
hootin' an' hollerin'...

296
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,470
..the same damn way you came in.

297
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,742
Good afternoon.

298
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,286
Afternoon.

299
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,250
What's the trouble, friend?

300
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,298
No trouble. We're looking for
the Youngers. Do you know them?

301
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,094
Sure I do.

302
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,930
A lot of 'em around these parts.

303
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:02,182
Big family.

304
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:06,561
- Who are you fellas?
- Come here to buy cattle.

305
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,858
This ain't Texas.

306
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,070
What about the Youngers?

307
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:20,450
You're lookin' at two of 'em.
You ain't here to buy cattle.

308
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,202
Now who are you fellas?

309
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,455
Goddamn Pinkertons!

310
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,835
- Which Younger are you?
- Question is, who are you?

311
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,131
I told ya. We're cattle buyers.

312
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:37,884
How dumb do you think we are?
You're Pinkerton men!

313
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,679
I'm Jim Younger.
This here's my cousin John.

314
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,683
You ain't lookin' for him.
He don't ride with us.

315
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,642
Is that right?

316
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,540
Go! Ha!

317
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:31,021
I told ya he was my cousin.
He never rode with us once.

318
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:33,481
18 year old, I gotta take him
back to his family, dead.

319
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,901
You broke the law.

320
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,484
People say they got one of the Youngers.

321
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,804
People say they got the wrong Younger.

322
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,615
All right, everybody ready?
Wait for 'em to come out.

323
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,547
God...

324
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,187
- What in the hell happened?
- I don't know.

325
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,314
We put a smoke in the cabin.

326
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,441
All of a sudden it blew.

327
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,695
The only thing we meant to do
was drive 'em out to us.

328
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:06,658
- Now you are sure it was not a bomb?
- Oh, no, it wasn't no bomb.

329
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:12,622
The old lady must have thrown it in
her fireplace and the kerosene went up.

330
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,249
That's the only thing I can figure.

331
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:18,420
Killing a simple-minded,
15-year-old boy.

332
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:22,299
You men did an excellent job in making
heroes out of every one of those men.

333
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:54,015
Archie Peyton Samuel
was an innocent boy.

334
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:58,561
It's a sad day when murder is committed
in the name of justice.

335
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:03,483
This act tries the forbearance
of good Christian men.

336
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,278
We commend
this child's body to the ground.

337
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:10,448
His soul belongs to the Lord.

338
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,759
Beth... Ed.

339
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,221
You didn't bring no gun.

340
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,017
I ain't got no quarrel
with the Pinkertons.

341
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:24,272
I'm sorry about what
happened to Archie, but, uh...

342
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:28,610
..since you boys kicked me out,
you can just fight your own fights.

343
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,363
Is that how you feel about it, Beth?

344
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:40,330
- No, it ain't.
- Come on. I've had enough talkin' here.

345
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,165
You go your own way.

346
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,836
Now you hold it.
You gotta learn to mind me.

347
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,421
Ed,...

348
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,382
..start walkin'.

349
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,478
Is that what you want, Beth?

350
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:11,653
Then to hell with you.

351
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,451
To hell with both of you.

352
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:43,476
Awful sorry about
your little brother. Sorry.

353
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:56,656
Just rest now. We're gonna take you
over to Schofield's house directly.

354
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:00,743
I'm sorry, Ma.

355
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,788
I'm so sorry.

356
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,543
Are you gonna make 'em pay, Jesse?

357
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:03,806
You got it wrong.

358
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,476
- We didn't do nothin'.
- Yes, you did.

359
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:10,146
Some of our friends saw you
on the north road that night.

360
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:15,985
Please, mister, it wasn't really a bomb.
It was supposed to smoke everybody out.

361
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,910
My little brother was 15 years old.

362
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,412
Now you think about that...

363
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,374
..on your way to hell.

364
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:48,267
The funeral will be in Chicago
and the governor will be there.

365
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:51,938
Well, I'm sure it'll cheer their souls
just to hear you say that.

366
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,982
It'd cheer them to know how many men
we have out combin' those hills.

367
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:58,903
Those boys got
a lot of friends out there.

368
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:34,564
What are these two doin' here?

369
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:38,651
Visitin'. You got a law against that?

370
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,404
No, ma'am. I got a law against murder.

371
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:43,239
I got a warrant right here.

372
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:46,075
I don't suppose it'd do me
any good to ask polite.

373
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,036
It won't do you any good to ask at all.

374
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:53,458
These men of yours are gonna end up
dead. Or they're gonna end up worse.

375
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:57,317
You ladies are gonna be left
all alone just to think about it.

376
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,506
Mr. Rowe!

377
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,218
I want people in the house
and in the wood!

378
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,721
All right, men, off your horses.
Let's go.

379
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,328
Sooey! Sooey!

380
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:43,883
Mornin', boys.

381
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:47,220
Mornin', Cole.

382
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:54,143
You boys waste the best part of the day.

383
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:58,064
Hard to say y'all farm-bred
the way you sleep in.

384
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,691
What's for breakfast?

385
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:03,069
Grits. Cracklin' grits.

386
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,029
Had 'em yesterday.

387
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:10,535
- I'm sick of this damn hidin' out.
- Who ain't?

388
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:14,747
Better mind your manners, Bob.
And thank McCorkindale here.

389
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,666
Don't be pickin' on Bob, Jesse.

390
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:20,336
- Hey, shut up, Jim.
- Shut up yourself, Frank.

391
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,964
I ain't got nothin' but respect
for Mr. McCorkindale.

392
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:28,261
You boys just got holed-up fever,
I know it.

393
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,638
All y'all need is some fresh air.

394
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,517
I'll get y'all some milk
as soon as I feed the chickens.

395
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,934
- What about McCorkindale?
- Dead.

396
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,312
- You sure?
- He's dead.

397
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,813
Piss on ya.

398
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:28,029
Cover him, dammit!

399
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:55,723
Next volley, we go.
Frank's hurt. He goes first.

What is your full name, Mrs. Samuel?
My paper would like to get it right.

407
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,520
Zerelda Cole Samuel.

408
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,900
My husband, Robert James,
died in California.

409
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:15,237
My second husband
was called Reuben Samuel.

410
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:18,908
And where did you and Mr. Samuel live?

411
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:21,827
Clay County, Missouri.

412
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,080
Are you the mother of Jesse James?

413
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,249

416
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:40,346
Mrs. Samuel,
you've already lost one son.

417
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:45,184
Aren't you afraid the other two will
end up the same as McCorkindale?

418
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:04,790
Ed, you identify the James boys or
the Youngers, there might be a reward.

419
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:11,585
- How much?
- A couple of thousand dollars.

420
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:15,881
Shit.

421
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:20,136
Well, I got a question for you.

422
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:23,639
How do I identify what you can't catch?

423
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:26,642
They'll be caught. Jesse and his boys
are done with you anyway.

424
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:29,895
Let me tell you one damn thing.

425
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:34,608
I turn 'em in and I'm gonna get killed
by one of their relatives, sure as hell.

426
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:38,112
I got six months to go
for bustin' up a place drunk,...

427
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:40,573
..so I'm just gonna
take my chances, all right?

428
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:46,704
Besides, Jesse might change his mind
and he pays better wages than you do,...

429
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,789
..Pinkerton man.

430
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,380
Frank, I never
saw myself as a farm girl.

431
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:59,675
You ain't gonna be farmin', Annie.
You're gonna raise horses.

432
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:02,678
I don't know anythin'
about raisin' horses, either.

433
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:04,930
You know, it's funny.
Outside of bein' a banker,...

434
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:08,225
..all I wanted to do
was to raise horses.

435
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:11,270
Well, thanks to the Pinkertons,
you're gettin' your chance.

436
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:16,525
We're not the only ones goin'
our own way. Everybody's doin' it.

437
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:20,654
Jim Younger's off in the hills.
God only knows where Jesse is.

438
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:22,781
Bob and Cole are headin' for Texas.

439
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:25,034
The only reason
Cole went to Texas

440
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:28,037
was he heard Belle Shirley
got married there.

441
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:32,583
It's a long way to go lookin' for
trouble. We'll be just fine, Annie.

442
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:34,460
Come on, mule!

443
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:34,436
You're late.

444
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:37,398
I'm not much for bein' on time.

445
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:40,901
You don't look real happy.

446
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:43,737
Well, I'll tell ya somethin'
about Texas.

447
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:45,322
It's loud.

448
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:48,409
Well, I never figured you
for the homesick type.

449
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:52,830
I ain't the homesick type.
I ain't the waitin' around type, either.

450
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:55,457
I ain't the reliable type.

451
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:58,127
Well, you oughta try gettin' married.

452
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:01,130
Might improve your character.

453
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:04,133
What do you do with that...
husband of yours?

454
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:06,802
Leave him home, tied to the bed?

455
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:09,054
Don't you make no fun of him.

456
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:13,475
The way I got it figured,
you're gonna wear that Indian out.

457
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:17,021
That double thump
and side swoop of yours.

458
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:20,733
I do what I want with who I want
and don't make no mistake about it.

459
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:23,193
Everybody says that
and they always have.

460
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:29,158
Now you wanna see somethin',
you watch this.

461
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:30,617
Come here!

462
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:40,544
- You done?
- Not by a damn sight.

463
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,061
Now are you done?

464
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:06,111
Sam.

465
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:09,531
You Cole Younger?

466
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,241
Who's askin'?

467
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:15,788
Sam Starr. I'm married to that lady.

468
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:18,582
Pleased to meet ya.

469
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:24,713
Well now, boys, there is no need
to fight over little old me.

470
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:28,258
But if you've got to,
you make it man-to-man.

471
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,846
Hand-to-hand.

472
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:38,143
Why not?

473
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:49,613
Well,...

474
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:53,617
..I'm glad I caught ya in a good mood.

475
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:09,633
Here you go, both of you. Have a chew.

476
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:15,389
- What does the winner get?
- Nothin' you both ain't already had.

477
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:20,811
It don't make much sense, does it?

478
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:25,149
No. You're both crazy.

479
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,694
But you keep me occupied.

480
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:32,781
I am having a real good time.

481
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:38,745
Ten bucks on the half-breed!

482
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:58,659
Come on, redskin!

483
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:24,017
Come on, Missouri.

484
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,743
What's the matter?

485
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:29,416
You got what you wanted.

486
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:02,157
- Sir, we met a few months back.
- I remember.

487
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:04,561
I'd like to ask you a couple
of questions for my newspaper,

488
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:05,994
if you don't mind.

489
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:10,123
Like why you're havin' so much trouble
bringin' in the James-Younger gang.

490
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:16,129
A lot of reasons. I came here with
four men that didn't know the territory.

491
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:17,714
They were murdered.

492
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:21,510
Most of the people here are related
to each other, so they're clannish.

493
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:23,387
What about the local police?

494
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:27,265
Local police get tired and quit
after chasin' the gang a coupla miles.

495
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:32,354
Also, newspapers like your own print
lies, sayin' they're Robin Hoods.

496
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:34,481
That doesn't help a great deal, either.

497
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:37,693
My readers may ask why
you're sittin' next to a warm fire...

498
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,361
..when you should be out on the chase.

499
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:43,323
Right now the bunch
are spread out across five states.

500
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,117
But they will be back.

501
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:37,085
Zee, did you have
any visitors while I was gone?

502
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:40,255
You mean was anyone

503
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:43,300
tryin' to straighten up your sheets
and fluff your pillow?

504
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:47,429
- I'm just askin'.
- Mind your manners, Mr. Jesse James.

505
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:49,491
Just 'cause you're off fightin'
railroads and banks,

506
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:51,933
don't mean you get a free tongue.

507
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:58,523
I sent out word to the rest.
We're gonna be meetin' up real soon.

508
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,318
We're goin' on a mission.

509
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:06,031
I'm gonna get myself some cash...

510
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:11,411
..and start lookin' around Missouri
for some girl to marry.

511
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,207
Any prospects?

512
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:18,710
I'm lookin'.

513
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:33,517
I don't know, Annie.

514
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:37,312
Maybe we're just goin'
in different directions.

515
01:03:38,564 --> 01:03:42,567
Maybe so. Can't help
wantin' what we want, can we?

516
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:45,028
Yeah.

517
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:51,701
Well, my going's got
nothin' to do with big dreams.

518
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:54,746
Nobody ever made you go
anywhere you didn't wanna go, Frank.

519
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:01,586
Good night.

520
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:23,608
- How are you doin', Jim?
- I'm doin' OK.

521
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:35,078
So, gents, let's get down to it.

522
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:37,330
What's our next job gonna be?

523
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:45,714
Minnesota. Them squareheads,
they got 'em a real fat bank up there.

524
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:50,677
I scouted it out myself. Northfield.

525
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:57,142
A lot of banks and cathouses
in Missouri we ain't done.

526
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:02,564
Cole's right. Minnesota...

527
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,191
It's a fair piece off our mark.

528
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:10,447
Well, Clell says that bank's full to the
brim with money. That sounds good to me.

529
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:18,914
I want Bill Chadwell and Charley Pitts
to go with us. They're goddamn good men.

530
01:05:20,374 --> 01:05:22,751
- Who says?
- I do.

531
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:20,058
I used to do this all the time.

532
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:23,144
But, uh...

533
01:06:25,564 --> 01:06:28,066
I got married a few years back.

534
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:33,989
I guess it slowed me down a bit,
if you know what I mean.

535
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:01,266
Mornin', Jess.

536
01:07:06,939 --> 01:07:09,190
Hope you boys
had a good time last night.

537
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:11,443
How was yours?

538
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,612
I got better things to think about.

539
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:20,118
Family man.

540
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:25,790
My family's somethin'
you don't talk about, Cole Younger.

541
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:10,085
♪ Well, I walked the street

542
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:12,754

549
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:42,450
Well, Frank, when this is all over,
I think I'll write me a book.

550
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:45,578
Make myself
even more famous than I am.

551
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:49,707
If a pig had wings, it would fly.

552
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:54,087
Nah. A book about my exploits...

553
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:57,215
..as a gentleman and a lover.

554
01:08:59,718 --> 01:09:02,387
- I expect a free copy.
- Free copy?

555
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:09,853
You gotta pay, Frank. Gotta pay.

556
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:15,024
Have you ever been up north before?

557
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:17,193
Got to Fetterman once.

558
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:20,822
- Went to shoot buffalo.
- How'd you do?

559
01:09:20,906 --> 01:09:24,784
The price of hides went to hell
and I got the clap off some squaw.

560
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:20,381
The bank's plumb in the center
of town,...

561
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:23,718
..right between the dry goods store
and the mortuary.

562
01:10:23,802 --> 01:10:28,264
You reckon we oughta send in
a coupla scouts, check it all out?

563
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:31,351
We rob banks, Jim.
We don't need any checkin'.

564
01:10:31,435 --> 01:10:34,437
You're talkin' soft,
somethin' I'd expect from Cole or Frank.

565
01:10:35,856 --> 01:10:38,858
I gave up tryin' to talk
sense to you a long time ago.

566
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:50,578
Come on, let's take the damn bank.

567
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:53,498
There ain't nothin' over there
but squareheads.

568
01:14:03,021 --> 01:14:04,981
All right, good people, nobody move.

569
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:08,734
Let's just show God
the palms of our hands.

570
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:11,028
Now you don't give us
no trouble, mister.

571
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:12,822
Clell, get to the vault.

572
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:23,624
- Är den här hästen till salu?
- He's not for sale.

573
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:25,084
Move on, squarehead.

574
01:14:32,092 --> 01:14:35,470
OK, now you open this safe
or I'll blow your head right off.

575
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:37,597
I can't. It's a time lock.

576
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:43,436
- What are you talkin' about?
- Time lock, hell!

577
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,521
You open that safe, mister, you hear?

578
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:49,525
The Pinkertons told us
you might be comin'.

579
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:52,695
The lock is set just for you.
It only works at 4:30.

580
01:14:54,031 --> 01:14:55,656
The whole town is ready.

581
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:10,213
No, mister, please don't shoot.
I have a family.

582
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:14,133
Now, you got five seconds
to open up that vault, mister.

583
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:18,721
Hur mycket ska ni ha för den?

584
01:15:18,805 --> 01:15:21,224
What the hell...? Get outta here!

585
01:15:22,809 --> 01:15:26,229
Det var synd. Det var eu vacker häst.

586
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:31,484
Be quiet, lady!

587
01:15:37,074 --> 01:15:39,367
- They're robbin' the bank!
- Jesus, Clell!

588
01:15:39,451 --> 01:15:42,620
They're robbin' the bank!

589
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:09,272
- Let's get the hell outta here.
- Come on, Clell.

590
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:28,165
Yankee bastard!

591
01:16:35,173 --> 01:16:36,507
Jim!

592
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,926
Bob!

593
01:20:11,598 --> 01:20:14,725
Cole! Jesse!

594
01:22:28,735 --> 01:22:30,319
We gotta move, Frank.

595
01:22:31,988 --> 01:22:34,365
They'll get the rest of 'em to a doctor.

596
01:22:36,701 --> 01:22:40,287
- Who will?
- The posse that's gonna be chasin' us.

597
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:44,333
We can't do that.
We can’t just leave 'em here alone.

598
01:22:59,599 --> 01:23:02,059
Jim, Cole,...

599
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:06,647
..we gotta ride.

600
01:23:10,568 --> 01:23:11,819
What about the rest of 'em?

601
01:23:11,903 --> 01:23:14,530
This just ain't no time
to argue, Cole.

602
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:20,160
Either you stay here an' die
or you come with us.

603
01:23:21,913 --> 01:23:23,414
Frank an' I are goin'.

604
01:23:51,609 --> 01:23:54,737
Kill me! Kill me, goddamn it!

605
01:23:55,822 --> 01:23:56,989
Frank.

606
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:03,912
You're not leavin', are ya?

607
01:24:08,752 --> 01:24:10,669
I gotta stick with my brother, Cole.

608
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:34,151
The Youngers don't need you.

609
01:25:16,903 --> 01:25:19,029
I like it better this way, Jesse.

610
01:25:20,865 --> 01:25:22,574
I get to see you run.

611
01:26:05,743 --> 01:26:08,245
Jim... Oh, Cole!

612
01:26:08,329 --> 01:26:12,291
Yeah, we're here, Bobby boy.
We're all here.

613
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:16,670
Goddamn squareheads.

614
01:26:38,818 --> 01:26:40,903
Where the hell's Missouri?

615
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:10,284
Come on, Frank.

616
01:28:11,661 --> 01:28:14,871
We're gonna get us a new gang together.
It's gonna be better than ever.

617
01:28:15,373 --> 01:28:17,833
Now you're not gonna quit on me now.

618
01:28:20,837 --> 01:28:22,963
All we gotta do is get across the river.

619
01:28:23,047 --> 01:28:25,340
All we gotta do is get home.

620
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:30,220
We never shoulda left.

621
01:29:15,099 --> 01:29:17,601
You could say we was drove to it.

622
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:22,272
Oh? How's that?

623
01:29:22,732 --> 01:29:26,568
If it weren't for the war,
we might have been somethin' else.

624
01:29:28,654 --> 01:29:31,531
You're a little too young
to have fought in the war.

625
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:35,369
But my brothers weren't,
and we all go one direction together.

626
01:29:35,453 --> 01:29:38,372
You tell me who they are
and it might mean a lighter sentence.

627
01:29:38,456 --> 01:29:39,873
Think about that.

628
01:29:39,957 --> 01:29:42,667
You and I both know it was
the James boys, don't we, Cole?

629
01:29:42,752 --> 01:29:45,462
Sure do feel poorly.

630
01:29:47,298 --> 01:29:50,217
Ain't a surprise. Eleven bullets
must be some kinda record.

631
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:53,720
What do you think about a life sentence?

632
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:56,014
You're lucky they don't allow
hangin' in this state.

633
01:29:57,683 --> 01:30:00,227
Come on, Cole.
Tell me what you think about all this.

634
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:08,318
Oh, hell, we played a rough game.

635
01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:10,028
We lost.

636
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:14,116
I spent four years in the army.

637
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:16,952
Eleven tryin' to get out of it.

638
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:20,372
What about the James boys?

639
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:25,001
- I don't know nothin' about 'em.
- Sure you do.

640
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:29,840
As far as I'm concerned,
they never been in this state.

641
01:30:43,604 --> 01:30:45,355
Are you another reporter?

642
01:30:46,232 --> 01:30:49,776
No. My name's Jacob Rixley.
I'm with the Pinkerton agency.

643
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:52,404
I been chasin' you boys
for a long time, Bob.

644
01:30:53,406 --> 01:30:55,240
Yes, sir, I guess you have.

645
01:30:55,992 --> 01:30:58,118
I wanna talk to you
about the James boys.

646
01:30:58,202 --> 01:31:00,454
You don't owe them a thing, you know.

647
01:31:00,538 --> 01:31:03,957
If it was them, they wouldn't
protect you to get them one day less.

648
01:31:04,041 --> 01:31:06,835
But unless you help me,

649
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:10,046
you and your brothers
are gonna be in this jail for life.

650
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:13,800
Uh-uh.

651
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:17,679
What's he tryin' to say?

652
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:22,559
He said to tell you we done it
for Dixie and nothin' else.

653
01:31:25,104 --> 01:31:27,314
15,000 for Jesse.

654
01:31:27,398 --> 01:31:29,733
Another 10,000 will get you Frank.

655
01:31:32,153 --> 01:31:34,905
The Pinkerton company and
the governor can't afford that.

656
01:31:34,989 --> 01:31:39,743
You know who you're talkin' to?
You know who sprung out of Missouri?

657
01:31:39,827 --> 01:31:42,746
Jameses, Youngers, Clantons, Earps.

658
01:31:43,247 --> 01:31:45,373
And now Bob and Charlie Ford.

659
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:48,168
Word's out that you and Jesse
aren't friends, anyway.

660
01:31:48,252 --> 01:31:52,172
Is that so? Well,
that very same Mr. Jesse James...

661
01:31:52,256 --> 01:31:55,217
..that you can't find at all
just asked us to come and visit him.

662
01:31:57,970 --> 01:31:59,638
Let's go, Bob.

663
01:32:01,098 --> 01:32:02,265
Wait a minute.

664
01:32:03,434 --> 01:32:05,227
$15,000.

665
01:32:06,103 --> 01:32:08,104
Half before and half when it's done.

666
01:32:09,232 --> 01:32:10,774
Got yourself a deal.

667
01:32:17,031 --> 01:32:18,490
No more for me.

668
01:32:21,869 --> 01:32:24,579
Heard you were thinkin'
about a bank in Kansas, Jesse.

669
01:32:25,706 --> 01:32:27,958
You don't talk business
at the table, Bob.

670
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:30,794
Sorry.

671
01:32:36,217 --> 01:32:37,676
Say, how'd you boys like a drink?

672
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,636
Sounds good.

673
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:43,390
- Don't it, Bob?
- Sure thing.

674
01:32:44,809 --> 01:32:47,060
Could I have your plate, please, Jesse?

675
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:52,941
Charlie.

676
01:33:03,953 --> 01:33:07,497
- Are you feelin' all right?
- She ain't real fond of the company.

677
01:33:10,876 --> 01:33:12,627
Don't worry none, ladies.

678
01:33:12,712 --> 01:33:15,297
Just talkin' some things over,
that's all.

679
01:33:25,182 --> 01:33:26,558
Can you say good night?

680
01:33:26,642 --> 01:33:28,435
Good night.

681
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:40,071
He might be carryin' a hide-out.
I bet he is.

682
01:33:41,365 --> 01:33:44,909
He knows. I know he knows.

683
01:33:50,541 --> 01:33:52,208
Pour me one, Bob.

684
01:33:56,797 --> 01:33:58,548
You look spooked, Charlie.

685
01:34:00,134 --> 01:34:01,593
Like hell.

686
01:34:02,511 --> 01:34:04,721
Nothin' spooks me, Jesse.
You know that.

687
01:34:09,518 --> 01:34:12,270
Now I've been thinkin'
about the Platte City bank.

688
01:34:12,355 --> 01:34:14,731
It's gonna be a big one.

689
01:34:14,815 --> 01:34:16,274
We ain't too sure.

690
01:34:17,276 --> 01:34:20,111
- Why not?
- I don't know.

691
01:34:20,196 --> 01:34:22,906
You're a hard man
to do business with, Jesse.

692
01:34:26,869 --> 01:34:28,620
It's crooked.

693
01:34:29,330 --> 01:34:30,330
What'd you say?

694
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:33,541
I said, it's not straight.

695
01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:41,633
I really like this old sampler.

696
01:34:42,301 --> 01:34:44,636
Ma gave this to me for my weddin' day.

697
01:34:48,766 --> 01:34:50,100
Is that straight?

698
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:53,395
I shot Jesse James.

699
01:35:00,486 --> 01:35:03,154
- Mr. Rixley?
- That's right.

700
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:06,116
My name is Frank James.

701
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:11,121
I came here to turn myself in.

702
01:35:13,499 --> 01:35:14,999
Here's my gun.

703
01:35:16,627 --> 01:35:18,336
I want something in return.

704
01:35:20,506 --> 01:35:22,632
I want to be able to bury my brother.

705
01:35:24,844 --> 01:35:26,803
Suppose I don't agree to your terms.

706
01:35:29,181 --> 01:35:30,348
