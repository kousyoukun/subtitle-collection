1
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,232
Can't he go any faster, Jesse?

2
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,102
Goin' fast enough, Ed.

3
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,911
- You watch them people, Frank.
- Shut up, Ed!

4
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,717
- What about that safe?
- There ain't no safe, Ed.

5
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:13,892
All the money's in the strongbox
and in the cash drawers.

6
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,958
I don't believe you!
You got a safe in here someplace.

7
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,965
You tell me where it is,
or I'm gonna put a bullet in your brain.

8
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,831
- Honest, Mister.
- Get out of here, Ed!

9
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,704
Are you going crazy, Ed?

10
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,708
Watch it, Jesse!

11
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,073
Jesse!

12
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,945
How long you think it'll take
that posse to get here?

13
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,581
There won't be one.

14
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:22,488
They'll go about 10 miles and get tired
and go back and call the Pinkertons.

15
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:28,991
- How come we're standing guard?
- 'Cause every once in a while, I'm wrong.

16
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,633
We'll take you upriver to Mimm's house.

17
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,140
Get the bullet out there.

18
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,744
- You stay quiet, now.
- Yeah.

19
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,755
Come here, Ed.

20
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,499
Jesse! Jesse!

21
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,603
- Shit, what'd you do that for?
- For panickin' and shootin' innocent folks.

22
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:11,666
Jesse!

23
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,575
That's for goddamn getting me near killed!

24
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,286
Shit, I didn't mean no harm.

25
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:25,546
You're through, Ed.
You ain't gonna ride with me no more.

26
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,364
You gonna take that off him?

27
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,430
I seen what you done.

28
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:39,336
You may be family and everything,
but I ain't sidin' with you.

29
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,502
You're on your own.

30
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,705
Cole, give him his cut.

31
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,968
You threw yourself away a good livin'.

32
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:15,873
Now, listen good.

33
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:19,476
Anybody connects the Jameses
or the Youngers with that bank...

34
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,103
...you're a dead man.

35
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,524
Hey, now, I saw her first.

36
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,186
Step back away. I saw her first.

37
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,604
What the hell was that all about?

38
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,868
Damned if I know.

39
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:25,577
"And although he may be poor

40
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:30,048

00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:34,577

00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:37,814
"Cry of freedom"

43
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,418
You boys hear what I hear?

44
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,093
I hear it.

45
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:48,056
Yeah, better go talk to this fella.

46
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:50,994
I'm out.

47
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:56,397
"From the east and from the west

"And we'll prove a loyal crew"

50
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,116
You've got real nice hands.

51
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,217
They're real pretty.

52
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,589
You want to keep them?

53
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,527
It was just a request.

54
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,475
Well, I got a request of my own.

55
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,701
<i>I'm a Good Ol' Rebel.</i>

56
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,544
"Oh, I'm a good old rebel

57
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,921
"Now, that's just what I am

58
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:49,155
"For this fair land of freedom

00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,387

00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:54,797

00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,959
"I only wish we'd won

62
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,162
"And I don't want no pardon

63
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,206
"For anything I done"

64
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,844
You keep losin', at this rate...

65
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,383
...you'll have to go out
and rob another train.

66
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,714
And scare some more innocent folk
half to death.

67
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,384
"I hates the declaration... "

68
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:20,925
- Never liked people standing behind me.
- Well, most people would be flattered.

69
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,928
Ain't often Belle Shirley
stands behind a man.

70
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,158
I reckon that's the truth.

71
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:31,167
"I fought it all I could"

72
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,473
Are you still asking $15?

73
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,345
I sure am.

74
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,121
Well, ain't nothing worth that price.

75
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:53,486
Well...

76
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,394
...I don't figure I'll miss much.

77
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,826
But I'll tell you what I will do.

78
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:06,671
I'll go $12.50 for you,
since you're about to go broke.

79
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,439
I only got $11.

80
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,343
Cut you for it.

81
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,278
Make your move.

82
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,734
I'll be go to hell.

83
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:43,466
When your luck changes,
you feel free to call on me.

84
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,242
Everybody ante up, huh?

85
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,378
Women.

86
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,480
Love 'em.

87
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,628
We's all in the war.

88
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,727
Robbed a first Yankee bank...

89
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,325
...'cause we didn't know no better.

90
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:12,166
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

91
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:15,067
After that, we's just in the habit.

92
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:20,104
So I guess we'll just keep on going...

93
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:23,705
...till they lock us up or hang us.

94
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,095
You've hardly given yourself
time enough to heal.

95
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,202
I gotta get back to things.

96
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:52,471
Ma needs money to help
keep the farm going.

97
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:58,311
I reckon your ma can keep the farm going
and a few more things to boot.

98
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,019
Well, the others ain't no good without me.

99
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:04,485
They gotta have somebody
to make the plans.

100
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,390
But...

101
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,984
...don't worry, Zee.

102
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,087
I'm coming back for you.

103
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,426
Thought you'd be over with that Tebbs girl.

104
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:18,668
Maybe I oughta be.
She's awfully pretty, ain't she?

105
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,262
If you think so.

106
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,834
'Course, every fellow around here's
been to visit her.

107
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,110
I don't guess you have
that problem, do you, Beth?

108
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:29,340
I have just as many visitors as I want.

109
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:32,483
- And you can count on it.
- Like who, for instance?

110
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:35,446
That's for me to know and you to find out.

111
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,349
How am I supposed to find out
if you won't tell me?

112
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:42,656
Jim Younger, there are some things
that a man does not ask a lady.

113
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:47,693
When you're old enough to call
yourself a lady, I'll keep that in mind.

114
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:54,739
Think maybe you oughta get married.
Is that what you want?

115
00:12:56,742 --> 00:13:00,405
Seems that you proposed to me
during the war about seven years ago.

116
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,041
That was different.

117
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:04,575
'Cept...

118
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:09,679
...I always knew that you were the one.

119
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,349
I just didn't have nothing
worked out, that's all.

120
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,324
That's a mouthful, Mr. Jesse James.

121
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,086
Well, it's a mouthful of truth.

122
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:22,266
Now, what you gotta decide is if
you want to get on the horse with me.

123
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:26,597
Now, I'm gonna be honest about it, Zee.
I ain't gonna change the way I live.

124
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,165
Well...

125
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:34,003
...it ain't right to try to change a person.

126
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:38,548
Truth is, Jesse, I wouldn't
like you any other way.

127
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,726
Next thing you know,
they'll get married and settle down.

128
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,062
First part, anyway.

129
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,929
He's asking her today.

130
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,172
Doesn't go with the way he's living.

131
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,111
He'll be fine.

132
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:13,309
First gettin' shot, then gettin' married.

133
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,347
Bad habits.

134
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,650
I'd like to have a white dress...

135
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:21,452
...and a proper weddin'.

136
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,427
Sounds like you want
the whole county there.

137
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:24,484
I do.

138
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:28,132
A girl only gets married once, you know?

139
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:08,063
I never was the marrying kind myself.
Kind of life I lead, women just felt troubled.

140
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,041
Footloose and fancy free, that's my style.

141
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,407
What about you, friend?

142
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,639
I ain't felt the call yet, but...

143
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,309
...if I was to meet a gal
as nice and pretty as this one here...

144
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,078
...I expect I could be persuaded.

145
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:22,279
I tell you something, Mister.
You best be watching your mouth...

146
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,117
...and not looking at my wife here.

147
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,484
Sorry.

148
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:27,549
Didn't mean no disrespect.

149
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,992
'Course he didn't. Just bein' polite.

150
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,462
Hey, old man, put a cork in it a while.

151
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,096
Vernon, be polite.

152
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,752
Goddamn outlaws.

153
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:02,419
Vernon, why don't you
just hand that over here?

154
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:05,563
Damn. You son of a bitch,
you're in it with 'em.

155
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,762
I would toss that shotgun away.

156
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,709
Throw down the box.

157
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,766
Any of you men fight
for the Stars and Bars?

158
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,461
Yes, sir. Proud of it.

159
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:45,869
May I shake your hand?
Bob Younger.

160
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:48,838
- George. George Arthur.
- Who were you with, George?

161
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,397
General Joe Shelby.

162
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,841
What about you?

163
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,203
- I was with Shelby, too.
- Where?

164
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:57,107
Coleharbor.

165
00:16:57,282 --> 00:17:00,774
Shelby weren't at Coleharbor.
You're a goddamned liar.

166
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:05,017
- Should I kill him?
- I would. I'd shoot the son of a bitch.

167
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:08,917
Bob, I want you to take
everything he has. You hear?

168
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,553
- Everything.
- Let me give you a hand.

169
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,996
You're lucky you ain't dead,
you son of a bitch.

170
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,364
Hope we didn't disturb
you too much, ma'am.

171
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:20,533
- Didn't mean you no harm.
- You scum! Take your hands off my wife.

172
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:24,340
If you shut up,
maybe I won't put a bullet in you.

173
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:30,044
Forgive me for saying so, ma'am but you
could've done better than Vernon here.

174
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,928
I'll be goddamned and go to hell.

175
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:01,206
"Jack of diamonds, jack of diamonds

176
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,908

00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,745
"You robbed my poor pockets

178
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,911
"Of silver and gold"

179
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,989
- Most people knock.
- I expect they do.

180
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:36,548
How many women you visited
before you come to see me?

181
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:40,276
This is my first stop.

182
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,165
Well, here I am.

183
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,434
"I'll bring the blind by way they know not.

184
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,602
"I will lead them into paths
they have not known.

185
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:12,541
"I will make darkness
light before them and...

186
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,119
"... I'll make crooked things straight. "

187
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:20,351
Isaiah: 42:16.

188

"Poor drunkard, poor drunkard

00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:26,754
"How bad I do feel"

190
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,933
You and me seem to be
gettin' along real good.

191
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,233
You might think about makin'
an honest woman out of me.

192
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,377
- You're serious, aren't you?
- Don't I sound it?

193
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:47,647
Well, then you gotta be crazy.

194
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:53,320
Just want to find out what it
feels like to be respectable.

195
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,317
For a while, anyway.

196
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,594
You'll never be respectable, Belle.

197
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,264
You're a whore.

198
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,598
You'll always be a whore.

199
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:11,765
It's why I like you.

200
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,072
Ready?

201
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,009
One.

202
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,175
Two.

203
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:21,509
Three.

204
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,859
- How you been, Beth?
- Fine.

205
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,225
Ain't you heard the news?
I'm engaged to Ed Miller.

206
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:07,324
Ed Miller?

207
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,225
He ain't no good.

208
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:16,239
- Besides, you're too young for all that.
- I'm 19 on the 23rd of September.

209
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,004
I don't want to wait around
forever like Zee did.

210
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:20,840
I don't want you saying
nothing bad about Ed...

211
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:22,880
...just 'cause Jesse picked on him.

212
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:27,113
Wasn't but a few months ago
I was pushing you in a swing.

213
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:31,451
Well, while you was pushing,
other people was noticing.

214
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,084
I noticed you, Beth.

215
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:40,529
You don't want to rush into things, Beth.

216
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,561
You can't undo 'em later.

217
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:45,426
I can't undo this one.

218
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:48,370
Ed's already bought land
over past Russellville.

219
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,799
'Sides, we told everybody.

220
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:56,043
Well, ain't much else to say, I guess.

221
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,880
You can wish me a good life.

222
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,047
I wish you that.

223
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,679
What you got to say for yourself, Jim?

224
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,416
Not much, Ed.

225
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:11,219
Be seeing you around.

226
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,572
How you been, Ed?

227
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,839
Oh, I'm fine.

228
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,368
How you doin', Clell?

229
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:29,942
Oh, I'm gettin' on pretty good.

230
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:35,717
This is my girl here. This is Beth Mimms.

231
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,549
We're gettin' married.

232
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,388
I heard you two took up together.

233
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,662
It's good to see you, Beth.

234
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:49,796
I'm doin' real fine, Clell.

235
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:53,070
Don't miss you boys none.

236
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,572
Come on, Beth.
Let's get to dancing here.

237
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:53,028
You scared?

238
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:58,063
Little bit. I expect I am.

239
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,904
Just walk up to 'em real steady, though.

240
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:03,834
We got nothin' to lose.

241
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:09,202
Now you let me do the talking, Bob.
You got that?

242
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:12,381
Say, do I look ok?

243
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:14,915
You look fine, Charlie.

244
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,493
You Frank James?

245
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:27,788
Who wants to know?

246
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,526
Charlie Ford, his little brother Bob.

247
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:33,564
What the hell you boys doin' here?

248
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:36,198
We want to join up.

249
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:38,671
We heard you were lookin'
for some new men.

250
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:41,579
Where'd you hear it from?

251
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:43,639
Your brother.

252
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,981
There ain't a horse we can't ride,
target we can't hit...

253
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:51,282
...or bank we can't rob.

254
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:57,793
You know how it is.
It was there. It seemed easy.

255
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,924
Just hauled out our guns
and made off with it.

256
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,492
Up in Joplin it was.

257
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:06,801
They chased us for two days.

258
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:11,070
You know how it is,
being out on the trail and all.

259
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:22,678
We only been out once, but we're willing.

260
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,986
What the hell were we talkin' about?

261
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:21,836
Hey, Coleman Younger!

262
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,948
Come on over here and say hello.

263
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:46,663
Evenin', ma'am.

264
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:51,207
Looks like everybody's havin'
a real good time at this affair.

265
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:54,702
I expect so.

266
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,674
Free drinks and food and all.

267
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:00,908
How come I wasn't invited?

268
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:03,643
'Cause you're a whore.

269
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,955
Yeah, well, at least I ain't a cheap one.

270
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,670
- See you later, Jess.
- See you, Jim.

271
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:55,862
- Bye.
- Bye, Zee.

272
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:04,445
Ain't gonna be too long that'll
be you and me, eh, Beth?

273
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,512
I reckon.

274
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:20,025
How are you?
I hear you bought a horse today.

275
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:22,389
I got a question for you.

276
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,692
Fire away, Frank.

277
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:27,029
Fire away and fall back.

278
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,642
You ever been in love?

279
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,877
Oh, God.

280
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:37,678
Yeah.

281
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:39,477
It was terrible.

282
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,283
An affliction.

283
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:44,582
Really miserable. Nothin' but trouble.

284
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,255
Drove me crazy.

285
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:48,686
That bad? Really?

286
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,622
Yeah.

287
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:53,824
She was wonderful.

288
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,445
What the hell you aiming to do?

289
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:22,713
I ain't aiming to do nothin'.
I'm doing it.

290
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:36,592
- Who are you, Jesse James?
- Hell, no. I'm Bob Younger.

291
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:41,335
Jesse James rides with the Youngers.
Now stop the damn train.

292
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:48,605
Don't worry, ladies and gentlemen.

293
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,615
We're just taking a permanent loan
from the Rock Island payroll.

294
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:38,518
Pinkerton Company, in conjunction with
the Union Pacific Railroad...

295
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:41,121
...is offering a reward of $5,000...

296
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:45,726
...for information leading to the arrest of
any member of the James-Younger gang.

297
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:58,973
- Mr. Rixley?
- That's right.

298
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,280
I'm Carl Reddick.
New York Herald sent me out...

299
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:03,479
...to cover the story
of the James-Younger gang.

300
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:05,749
You might say I'm interested
in the same thing.

301
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:09,588
What do you think your chances
are of bringing 'em in?

302
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:12,288
That's an amazingly stupid question.

303
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,889
I want your sons, Mrs. Samuel.

304
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:49,591
- What do you want 'em for?
- For robbing banks and trains.

305
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:53,194
Then you Yankees can just turn
around and head on back.

306
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:55,634
Sounds like you got
the wrong James family.

307
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:58,535
Yes, ma'am, I am a Yankee and a city man.

308
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:00,804
But these men with me here,
they're southern.

309
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,879
They rode with the Stars and Bars
during the struggle.

310
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:05,507
What are they chasing my boys for then?

311
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,477
Because they steal, ma'am.

312
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:09,580
I'm afraid I'll have to go
in there and look for 'em.

313
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,054
This paper here gives me
the right to do that.

314
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:21,196
Things have come to a pretty place
when a widow woman...

315
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:23,665
...with a 15-year-old backward baby boy...

316
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:26,363
...gets treated like this,
and they call it legal!

317
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:28,562
I am sorry, ma'am.

318
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:36,012
How come I never been asked?

319
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:39,181
Maybe you ain't cut out for it.

320
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:42,510
We got enough hands the way it is.

321
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,017
You keep me in mind.

322
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:46,556
I can rob banks as good as them
Millers or your brother Bob.

323
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:48,489
- Ain't nothin' to it.
- Think so?

324
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:50,823
Shit, what's to know
about robbing a bank?

325
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:53,259
You ride into town like
thunder and cannonballs...

326
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:56,300
...guns blazin', scaring the Jesus
out of everyone in sight...

327
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,299
...until they're frozen.

328
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,632
Then you ride right
in the bank on your horse...

329
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,695
...you dynamite the safe
and ride off with the loot.

330
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:04,333
Hootin' and hollerin'
same damn way as you came in.

331
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:06,610
That right?

332
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:27,323
Good afternoon.

333
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,426
Afternoon.

334
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:34,898
What's the trouble, friend?

335
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:39,743
No trouble.
We're looking for the Youngers.

336
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:41,644
You know them?

337
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:45,642
Sure I do.

338
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,981
Lot of 'em around these parts.

339
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:50,020
Big family.

340
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:54,425
- Who are you fellas?
- Come here to buy cattle.

341
00:34:58,396 --> 00:34:59,829
This ain't Texas.

342
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,956
What about the Youngers?

343
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:05,558
You're lookin' at two of 'em.

344
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,768
And you ain't here to buy cattle.

345
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:09,898
Who are you fellas?

346
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:12,736
Goddamn Pinkertons!

347
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:17,644
- Which Younger are you?
- Question is who are you?

348
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:19,840
I told you.

349
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,713
- We're cattle buyers.
- How dumb you think we are?

350
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,551
You're Pinkerton men!

351
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:27,288
I'm Jim Younger.

352
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:31,721
This is my cousin John. You ain't lookin'
for him, he don't ride with us.

353
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:33,994
Is that right?

354
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:16,967
I told you he was my cousin.

355
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,699
He never rode with us once.

356
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:21,977
Eighteen years old, and I gotta take
him back to his family dead.

357
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,579
You broke the law.

358
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:49,898
People say they got one of the Youngers.

359
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,975
People say they got the wrong Younger.

360
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:09,223
Stand back.

361
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:12,057
All right, now everybody ready.
Wait for 'em to come out.

362
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,570
God.

363
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,150
- What in the hell happened?
- I don't know.

364
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:46,159
We put a smoker in the cabin.
All of a sudden it blew.

365
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:50,092
The only thing we meant to do
was drive 'em out to us.

366
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:54,837
- Now, you're sure it was not a bomb?
- No. It wasn't no bomb.

367
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,835
The old lady must've thrown
the smoker in the fireplace...

368
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:02,470
...and the kerosene went up.
That's the only thing I can figure at.

369
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:06,041
Killing a simple-minded 15-year-old boy.

370
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:11,117
You men did excellent at making heroes
out of every one of those gentlemen.

371
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:41,636
Archie Payton Samuel
was an innocent boy.

372
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:46,239
It's a sad day when murder
is committed in the name of justice.

373
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:50,849
This act tries the forbearance
of good Christian men.

374
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,555
We commend this child's body
to the ground.

375
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:58,451
His soul belongs to the Lord.

376
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:58,115
Beth.

377
00:40:58,923 --> 00:40:59,947
Ed.

378
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:02,586
Didn't bring no gun.

379
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:07,162
I ain't got no quarrel with them Pinkertons.

380
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,034
I'm sorry about what happened
to Archie, but...

381
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:17,372
...since you boys kicked me out you can
just go ahead and fight your own fights.

382
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:20,435
That how you feel about it, Beth?

383
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:26,174
- No, it ain't.
- Come on, Beth.

384
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:30,209
- I've had enough talkin' with this fella here.
- You go your own way.

385
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:34,683
Now you hold it, woman.
You gotta learn to mind me.

386
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:36,123
Hey, Ed...

387
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,253
...start walkin'.

388
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:51,338
Is that what you want, Beth?

389
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:59,580
Then to hell with you.

390
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:06,084
To hell with both of you.

391
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:31,705
Awful sorry about your little brother.
Sorry.

392
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:39,180
Mama.

393
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:41,856
Just rest now.

394
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:45,319
We're gonna take you over
to Scofield's house directly.

395
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,831
I'm sorry, ma.

396
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:51,491
I'm so sorry.

397
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:56,372
You gonna make 'em pay, Jesse?

398
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:52,886
You got it wrong, Mister.
We didn't do nothin'.

399
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,726
Yes, you did.

400
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:58,398
Some of our friends saw you
on the north road that night.

401
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,696
Please, Mister. It wasn't really a bomb.

402
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:04,400
It was just supposed
to smoke everybody out.

403
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:11,874
My little brother was 15 years old.

404
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,943
Now, you think about that...

405
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:17,247
...on your way to hell.

406
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:36,463
The funeral will be in Chicago,
and the governor will be there.

407
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:39,872
I'm sure it'll cheer their souls
just to hear you say that.

408
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:43,709
It'd cheer them to know how many men
we have out combing those hills.

409
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:46,782
Those boys got a lot of friends out there.

410
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:22,685
What are these two doing here?

411
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:24,484
Visiting.

412
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:27,449
- You got a law against that?
- No, ma'am.

413
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:31,119
I got a law against murder,
and I got a warrant right here.

414
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:34,058
I don't suppose it'd do me any good
to ask polite, would it?

415
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:36,599
It won't do you any good to ask at all.

416
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,965
These men of yours
are gonna end up dead...

417
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:42,265
...or they're gonna end up worse.

418
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:45,403
You ladies will be left all alone
just to think about it.

419
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:48,135
Mr. Rowe!

420
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:52,041
I want people in the house.
I want people in the woods.

421
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:55,017
All right, men, off your horses.
Let's go.

422
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,512
Morning, boys.

423
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:34,515
Morning, Cole.

424
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:42,388
You boys wasted the best part of the day.

425
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:46,126
Hard to say y'all are farm bred,
the way you sleep in.

426
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,696
What's for breakfast?

427
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:50,763
Grits. Cracklin' grits.

428
00:46:51,408 --> 00:46:52,670
Had 'em yesterday.

429
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:58,937
- I'm sick of this damn hiding out.
- Who ain't?

430
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:02,548
Better mind your manners, Bob
and thank McCorkindale here.

431
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:04,711
Don't be picking on Bob, Jesse.

432
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,552
- Hey, shut up, Jim.
- Shut up yourself, Frank.

433
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:11,058
I ain't got nothing but respect
for Mr. McCorkindale.

434
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:16,198
You boys just got holdup fever.
I know it.

435
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:18,663
All y'all need's a little fresh air.

436
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,472
I'll get y'all some milk
soon as I feed the chickens.

437
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,810
- What about McCorkindale?
- He's dead.

438
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,782
- You sure?
- He's dead.

439
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:07,942
Piss on you!

440
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,491
Cover him, damn it!

441
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:44,017
Next volley, we go.
Frank's hurt, he goes first.

442
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:17,041
<i>"Jesus, my Lord</i>

443
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:19,511

"Where there's no more... "

451
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:48,371
What is your full name, Mrs. Samuel?

452
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:50,742
My paper would like to get it right.

453
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:53,974
Zerelda Cole Samuel.

454
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:58,554
My husband Robert James
died in California.

455
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,120
My second husband
was called Ruben Samuel.

456
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,453
Ruben.

457
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:06,623
And where did you and Mr. Samuel live?

458
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:09,526
Clay County, Missouri.

459
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,368
Are you the mother of Jesse James?

460
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:14,300
I am.

461
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:17,865
"His track I'll see

"Where there's no more

464
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:27,846
Mrs. Samuel, you've already lost one son.

465
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:31,281
Aren't you afraid your other
two boys are gonna end up...

466
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:33,322
...the same as McCorkindale there?

467
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:37,417
"Where there's no more
stormy clouds arising"

468
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,239
Ed, you identify the James boys...

469
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:54,334
...and the Youngers,
might mean a reward for you.

470
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:59,376
- How much?
- Couple thousand dollars.

471
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:03,818
Shit.

472
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:07,856
I got a question for you.

473
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:11,319
How do I identify
what you can't even catch?

474
00:52:11,394 --> 00:52:12,588
They are gonna get caught.

475
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:14,789
Jesse and his boys are
done with you anyway.

476
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:17,493
Let me tell you one damn thing.

477
00:52:19,102 --> 00:52:23,038
I turn 'em in, and I'm gonna get killed
by one of their relatives, sure as hell.

478
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,075
I got six months to go here
for busting up a place drunk...

479
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:29,306
...so I'm just gonna take
my chances, all right?

480
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:32,440
Besides, Jesse just
might change his mind...

481
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:35,109
...and he pays better wages than you do...

482
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:37,080
...Pinkerton man.

483
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:44,224
Frank, I never saw myself as a farm girl.

484
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:47,092
We ain't gonna be farming, Annie.
We're gonna raise horses.

485
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,894
I don't know anything
about raising horses, either.

486
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:52,728
You know, it's funny.
Outside of being a banker...

487
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:55,964
...about the only thing I ever wanted to do
was to raise horses.

488
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:59,269
Thanks to the Pinkertons,
you're getting your chance.

489
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:00,565
Ha, mule!

490
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:02,811
And we're not the only ones
going our own way.

491
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:04,369
Everybody's doing it.

492
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:08,440
Jim Younger's off in the hills somewhere.
God only knows where Jesse is.

493
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,418
Bob and Cole are heading for Texas.

494
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:12,849
The only reason why
Cole Younger went to Texas...

495
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:16,016
...is 'cause he heard Belle Shirley
got married down there.

496
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:18,617
It's a long way to go looking for trouble.

497
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:20,491
He'll be just fine, Annie.

498
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:23,125
Ha, mule! Yo!

499
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:25,100
Ha, mule!

500
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:21,882
You're late.

501
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:25,060
I'm not much for being on time.

502
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:28,523
You don't look real happy.

503
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:31,290
Well, I'll tell you something about Texas.

504
00:54:31,635 --> 00:54:32,966
It's loud.

505
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:36,337
I never figured you for the homesick type.

506
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:40,833
I ain't the homesick type.
I ain't the waiting-around type either.

507
00:54:41,144 --> 00:54:43,271
I ain't the reliable type.

508
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:46,077
You ought to try getting married.

509
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:49,045
Might improve your character.

510
00:54:49,185 --> 00:54:51,176
What do you do with that...

511
00:54:51,254 --> 00:54:54,519
...husband of yours,
leave him home, tied to the bed?

512
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:56,988
Don't you make no fun of him.

513
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:01,328
The way I got it figured,
you're gonna wear that Indian out.

514
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:04,490
Double-thump side swoop of yours.

515
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:08,727
I do what I want with who I want,
and don't make no mistake about it.

516
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:11,238
Everybody says that.
They always have.

517
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:16,404
You want to see something,
you watch this.

518
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,804
Come here.

519
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:28,090
- You done?
- Not by a damn sight.

520
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:45,206
Now you're done.

521
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:54,010
Sam.

522
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:57,446
You Cole Younger?

523
00:55:58,154 --> 00:55:59,485
Who's asking?

524
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:01,355
Sam Starr.

525
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:03,583
I'm married to that lady.

526
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:06,820
Pleased to meet you.

527
00:56:09,165 --> 00:56:12,532
Boys, there is no need
to fight over little old me.

528
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:16,164
But if you've got to,
you make it man-to-man.

529
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:20,466
Hand-to-hand.

530
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:25,909
Why not?

531
00:56:39,295 --> 00:56:41,923
I'm glad I caught you in a good mood.

532
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:55,267
Here you go, both of you.

533
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:57,712
Have a chew.

534
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:00,372
What does the winner get?

535
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:03,214
Nothing you both ain't already had.

536
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:08,815
Don't make much sense, does it?

537
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:11,351
Nope.

538
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,191
You're both crazy.

539
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:16,289
But you keep me occupied.

540
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:20,631
I am having a real good time.

541
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:26,975
Ten bucks on the half-breed, right here.

542
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:09,703
Get off of me!

543
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,445
Come on, Missouri.

544
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,232
What's the matter?

545
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:17,240
You got what you wanted.

546
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:48,669
Sir, we met a few months back.

547
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:50,077
I remember.

548
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:54,378
I'd like to ask you a couple of questions
for my newspaper if you don't mind.

549
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:58,644
Like why you're having so much trouble
bringing in the James-Younger gang.

550
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:01,255
A lot of reasons.

551
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:03,857
Came down here with four men
that didn't know the territory.

552
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:05,359
They were murdered.

553
01:01:05,595 --> 01:01:08,155
Most the people around here
are related to each other...

554
01:01:08,264 --> 01:01:09,390
...so they're very clannish.

555
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:11,124
What about the local police?

556
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:15,098
Local police get tired and quit
after chasing the gang a couple of miles.

557
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:18,667
There are also newspapers like your own
that print lies about the gang...

558
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:21,904
...saying they're Robin Hoods.
That doesn't help either.

559
01:01:22,111 --> 01:01:23,840
My readers may want to know
why you're sitting...

560
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:27,906
...here next to this warm, friendly fire
when you should be out on the chase.

561
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:31,076
Right now the whole bunch of them
are spread out across five states.

562
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,049
But they will be back.

563
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:24,871
Zee, did you have any visitors
while I was gone?

564
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:28,166
Do you mean was there
anybody poking around...

565
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:30,940
...trying to straighten up your
sheets and fluff your pillow?

566
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:32,344
I'm just asking.

567
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:35,213
Why don't you just mind your
manners, Mr. Jesse James?

568
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:37,149
Just 'cause you're off
fighting railroads and banks...

569
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:40,553
...don't mean you get a free
tongue around this house.

570
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:46,026
I sent out a word to the rest.
Gonna be meeting up real soon.

571
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:48,822
Going on a mission.

572
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:53,900
I'm gonna get myself a little cash.

573
01:02:56,072 --> 01:03:00,202
Start looking around this here state
of Missouri for some girl to marry.

574
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:03,204
Any prospects?

575
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:06,240
I'm looking.

576
01:03:19,695 --> 01:03:21,629
I don't know, Annie.

577
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:24,964
Maybe we're just going
in different directions.

578
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:27,667
Maybe so.

579
01:03:27,904 --> 01:03:30,304
Can't help wanting what we want, can we?

580
01:03:36,913 --> 01:03:39,381
My going's got nothing
to do with big dreams.

581
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:42,918
Nobody ever made you go anywhere
you didn't want to go, Frank.

582
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:49,417
Good night.

583
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:11,245
- How you doin', Jim?
- I'm doin', okay.

584
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:25,024
So, gents. Let's get down to it.
What's our next job gonna be?

585
01:04:27,763 --> 01:04:29,162
Minnesota.

586
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:33,232
Them squareheads,
they got 'em a real fat bank up there.

587
01:04:34,403 --> 01:04:36,132
Scouted it out myself.

588
01:04:37,273 --> 01:04:38,831
Northfield.

589
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:45,070
A lot of banks and cat houses
in Missouri we ain't done.

590
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:48,750
Cole's right.

591
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:50,641
Minnesota...

592
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:53,382
...it's a fair piece off our mark.

593
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:56,592
Clell says that bank's
full to the brim with money.

594
01:04:56,993 --> 01:04:58,585
It sounds good to me.

595
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:05,156
I want Bill Chadwell
and Charlie Pitts to go with us.

596
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:06,892
They're goddamn good men.

597
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:09,230
Who says?

598
01:05:09,705 --> 01:05:11,036
I do.

599
01:06:06,028 --> 01:06:08,360
I used to do this all the time.

600
01:06:09,565 --> 01:06:10,964
But I...

601
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:15,567
...I got married a few years back.

602
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:19,363
I guess it slowed me down a bit.

603
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:21,968
If you know what I mean.

604
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:48,764
Morning, Jess.

605
01:06:54,643 --> 01:06:57,168
I hope you boys had a good time last night.

606
01:06:57,446 --> 01:06:59,073
How was yours?

607
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:02,542
I got better things to think about.

608
01:07:06,422 --> 01:07:07,946
Family man.

609
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:13,559
My family is something you don't
talk about, Cole Younger.

610
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:57,971
"Well, I walked the street
with a tap to my feet

611
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,406
"Heard a voice above me

612
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:05,411
"A maid looked out the window up above
needed somebody to love me

613
01:08:05,514 --> 01:08:10,383
"My father, he's a minister
and virgins he doth cherish

614
01:08:10,453 --> 01:08:15,413
"Now she's got five boys, seven little girls
and a baby on her shoulder"

615
01:08:25,134 --> 01:08:26,533
You know, Frank...

616
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:30,800
...when this is all over,
I think I'll write me a book.

617
01:08:30,873 --> 01:08:33,603
Make myself even more famous than I am.

618
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:37,577
If a pig had wings, it would fly.

619
01:08:40,182 --> 01:08:42,173
A book about my exploits...

620
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:45,087
...as a gentleman and a lover.

621
01:08:47,356 --> 01:08:49,017
I expect a free copy.

622
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:50,522
Free copy?

623
01:08:53,762 --> 01:08:55,389
You gotta pay, Frank.

624
01:08:56,565 --> 01:08:57,827
You gotta pay.

625
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:02,037
You ever been up North before?

626
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:04,840
Got to Fetterman once.

627
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:07,002
Went to shoot buffalo.

628
01:09:07,176 --> 01:09:08,404
How'd you do?

629
01:09:08,878 --> 01:09:12,837
The price of hides went to hell,
and I got the clap off some squaw.

630
01:10:05,935 --> 01:10:08,301
The bank's plumb in the center of town.

631
01:10:08,437 --> 01:10:11,600
Right between the dry goods store
and the mortuary.

632
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:16,142
You reckon we ought to send in
a couple of scouts? Check it all out?

633
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:18,976
We rob banks, Jim.
We don't need any checking.

634
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:22,345
Talking soft I might expect
from Cole or Frank.

635
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:26,814
I gave up trying to talk sense
to you a long time ago.

636
01:10:36,332 --> 01:10:38,459
Come on, let's take the damn bank.

637
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:42,028
There ain't nothin' over there
but squareheads anyhow.

638
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:53,091
All right, you people, nobody move.

639
01:13:54,163 --> 01:13:56,529
Let's just show God
the palms of our hands.

640
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:58,998
Now you don't give us no trouble, Mister.

641
01:13:59,234 --> 01:14:00,792
Clell, get to the vault.

642
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:13,178
No, he's not for sale.
Just move on, squarehead.

643
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:23,187
Now you open that safe
or I'll blow your head right off.

644
01:14:23,425 --> 01:14:25,416
I can't, it's a time lock.

645
01:14:28,096 --> 01:14:30,963
- What are you talking about?
- Time lock, hell.

646
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,828
You open that safe, Mister, you hear?

647
01:14:34,536 --> 01:14:36,629
The Pinkertons told us
you might be coming.

648
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:40,538
The lock is set just for you.
It only works at 4:30.

649
01:14:41,777 --> 01:14:43,244
The whole town is ready.

650
01:14:55,123 --> 01:14:58,854
No, no, mister, please don't shoot.
I have a family.

651
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:02,220
Now you got five seconds
to open up that vault, mister.

652
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:08,994
What the hell? Get out of here.

653
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,347
Be quiet, lady!

654
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:26,110
They're robbing the bank!

655
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:27,382
Jesus, Clell!

656
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:30,754
They're robbing the bank!
They're robbing the bank!

657
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:57,308
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- Come on, Clell.

658
01:16:13,502 --> 01:16:15,936
- Clell, come on!
- Yankee bastard.

659
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:24,302
Jim!

660
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:26,371
Bob!

661
01:19:59,427 --> 01:20:00,621
Cole!

662
01:20:01,163 --> 01:20:02,391
Jesse!

663
01:20:03,098 --> 01:20:05,089
Oh, God!

664
01:20:05,433 --> 01:20:06,923
Cole!

665
01:22:16,464 --> 01:22:18,227
We gotta move, Frank.

666
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:21,829
They'll get the rest of 'em to a doctor.

667
01:22:24,406 --> 01:22:25,566
Who will?

668
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:27,708
The posse that's gonna be chasing us.

669
01:22:29,044 --> 01:22:32,309
We can't do that.
We can't just leave 'em here alone.

670
01:22:47,329 --> 01:22:48,421
Jim.

671
01:22:49,164 --> 01:22:50,290
Cole.

672
01:22:52,901 --> 01:22:54,425
We gotta ride.

673
01:22:58,239 --> 01:22:59,501
What about the rest?

674
01:22:59,574 --> 01:23:02,008
This just ain't no time
to argue with you, Cole.

675
01:23:04,913 --> 01:23:07,814
Either you stay here and die,
or you come with us.

676
01:23:09,484 --> 01:23:11,213
Frank and I are going.

677
01:23:39,414 --> 01:23:40,438
Kill me.

678
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:43,313
Goddamn it. Kill me.

679
01:23:43,451 --> 01:23:44,713
Frank?

680
01:23:49,958 --> 01:23:51,789
You're not leaving, are you?

681
01:23:56,364 --> 01:23:58,594
I gotta stick with my brother, Cole.

682
01:24:20,088 --> 01:24:22,056
The Youngers don't need you.

683
01:25:04,566 --> 01:25:06,659
I like it better this way, Jesse.

684
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:10,027
I get to see you run.

685
01:25:53,348 --> 01:25:55,475
Jim? Oh, Cole.

686
01:25:56,351 --> 01:25:58,012
Yeah, we're here, Bobby boy.

687
01:25:58,953 --> 01:26:00,420
We're all here.

688
01:26:01,923 --> 01:26:05,017
Goddamned squareheads.

689
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:28,842
Where the hell's Missouri?

690
01:27:56,537 --> 01:27:58,164
Come on, Frank.

691
01:27:59,207 --> 01:28:02,768
We're gonna get us a new gang together.
It's gonna be better than ever.

692
01:28:03,144 --> 01:28:05,237
You're not gonna quit on me now.

693
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:13,216
All we got to do is get across the river.
All we got to do is get home.

694
01:28:16,357 --> 01:28:18,291
We never should have left.

695
01:29:03,204 --> 01:29:05,069
You could say we was drove to it.

696
01:29:08,409 --> 01:29:09,876
How's that?

697
01:29:10,812 --> 01:29:14,179
If it weren't for the war,
we might have been something else.

698
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:18,478
You're a little too young
to have fought in the war.

699
01:29:18,553 --> 01:29:23,047
That's true, but my brothers weren't.
And we all go one direction together.

700
01:29:23,291 --> 01:29:26,158
You tell me who they are,
it might mean a lighter sentence.

701
01:29:26,227 --> 01:29:27,489
You think about that.

702
01:29:27,628 --> 01:29:30,290
You and I both know it was
the James boys, don't we?

703
01:29:31,399 --> 01:29:33,196
Sure do feel poorly.

704
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:38,168
Ain't a surprise. Eleven bullets
must be some kind of record.

705
01:29:39,107 --> 01:29:41,302
What do you and your brothers
think about a life sentence?

706
01:29:41,409 --> 01:29:44,435
You're lucky they don't allow
hanging in this state.

707
01:29:45,313 --> 01:29:48,373
Come on, Cole.
Tell me what you think about all this.

708
01:29:53,855 --> 01:29:56,016
Hell, we played a rough game.

709
01:29:56,457 --> 01:29:57,515
We lost.

710
01:29:59,727 --> 01:30:01,661
I spent four years in the army.

711
01:30:02,463 --> 01:30:04,454
Eleven trying to get out of it.

712
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,493
What about the James boys?

713
01:30:09,971 --> 01:30:12,906
- I don't know nothing about 'em.
- Sure you do.

714
01:30:14,776 --> 01:30:17,677
Far as I'm concerned,
they never been in this state.

715
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:32,917
You another reporter?

716
01:30:33,961 --> 01:30:37,692
No. My name is Jacob Rixley.
I'm with the Pinkerton agency.

717
01:30:37,932 --> 01:30:40,400
I've been chasing you boys
for a long time, Bob.

718
01:30:41,068 --> 01:30:42,865
Yes, sir, I guess you have.

719
01:30:43,638 --> 01:30:45,936
I want to talk to you
about the James boys.

720
01:30:46,307 --> 01:30:48,775
You don't owe them a thing.
You know that, don't you?

721
01:30:48,843 --> 01:30:51,937
They wouldn't protect you if
it'd get them one day less.

722
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:54,443
But unless you help me...

723
01:30:55,216 --> 01:30:58,777
...you and your brothers
are going to be in this jail for life.

724
01:31:03,858 --> 01:31:05,758
What's he trying to say?

725
01:31:07,028 --> 01:31:10,520
He said to tell you we done it
for Dixie and nothin' else.

726
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:14,595
15,000 for Jesse.

727
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:17,601
Another 10,000 will get you Frank.

728
01:31:19,807 --> 01:31:23,174
The Pinkerton company and
the governor can't afford that.

729
01:31:23,444 --> 01:31:25,139
You know who you're talking to?

730
01:31:25,513 --> 01:31:27,777
You know what kind of a man
sprung out of Missouri?

731
01:31:27,849 --> 01:31:30,613
The Jameses, Youngers, Clantons, Earps.

732
01:31:31,052 --> 01:31:33,111
And now Bob and Charlie Ford.

733
01:31:33,187 --> 01:31:36,179
Word's out you and Jesse
aren't even friends anyway.

734
01:31:36,524 --> 01:31:37,752
Is that so?

735
01:31:37,825 --> 01:31:40,988
That same Mr. Jesse James
you can't find at all...

736
01:31:41,095 --> 01:31:43,461
...just asked us to come and visit him.

737
01:31:46,133 --> 01:31:47,725
Let's go, Bob.

738
01:31:48,903 --> 01:31:50,165
Wait a minute.

739
01:31:51,038 --> 01:31:52,369
$15,000.

740
01:31:53,708 --> 01:31:55,699
Half before and half when it's done.

741
01:31:56,878 --> 01:31:58,436
Got yourself a deal.

742
01:32:04,652 --> 01:32:06,415
No more for me.

743
01:32:09,557 --> 01:32:12,219
Heard you were thinking
of a bank in Kansas, Jesse.

744
01:32:13,427 --> 01:32:15,895
We don't talk business at the table, Bob.

745
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:18,593
Sorry.

746
01:32:23,804 --> 01:32:25,738
How'd you boys like a drink?

747
01:32:26,007 --> 01:32:27,497
Sounds good.

748
01:32:28,409 --> 01:32:29,967
Don't it, Bob?

749
01:32:30,177 --> 01:32:31,644
Sure thing.

750
01:32:32,513 --> 01:32:34,743
Could I have your plate, please, Jesse?

751
01:32:39,186 --> 01:32:40,517
Charlie.

752
01:32:51,632 --> 01:32:55,227
- You feelin' all right?
- She ain't real fond of the company.

753
01:32:58,439 --> 01:33:00,498
Don't worry none, ladies.

754
01:33:00,908 --> 01:33:03,172
Just talking some things over, that's all.

755
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:14,415
Can you say, "good night"?

756
01:33:24,198 --> 01:33:27,929
He might be carryin' a hideout.
I bet he is.

757
01:33:28,970 --> 01:33:30,335
He knows.

758
01:33:30,838 --> 01:33:32,965
I know he knows.

759
01:33:38,145 --> 01:33:39,874
Pour me one, Bob.

760
01:33:44,518 --> 01:33:46,509
You look spooked, Charlie.

761
01:33:47,688 --> 01:33:49,053
Like hell.

762
01:33:50,024 --> 01:33:52,549
Nothing spooks me, Jesse.
You know that.

763
01:33:57,231 --> 01:34:00,029
Now, I been thinking about
the Platte City bank.

764
01:34:00,368 --> 01:34:01,767
It's gonna be a big one.

765
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:04,233
We ain't too sure.

766
01:34:05,239 --> 01:34:07,537
- Why not?
- I don't know.

767
01:34:08,242 --> 01:34:10,733
You're a hard man to do business with.

768
01:34:14,815 --> 01:34:16,146
It's crooked.

769
01:34:17,051 --> 01:34:18,450
What did you say?

770
01:34:19,487 --> 01:34:21,478
Said it's not straight.

771
01:34:27,461 --> 01:34:29,622
I really like this old sampler.

772
01:34:29,930 --> 01:34:32,125
Ma gave this to me for my wedding day.

773
01:34:36,537 --> 01:34:38,164
Is that straight?

774
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:41,370
I shot Jesse James.

775
01:34:48,082 --> 01:34:50,380
- Mr. Rixley?
- That's right.

776
01:34:51,986 --> 01:34:53,886
My name is Frank James.

777
01:34:56,757 --> 01:34:58,884
I came here to turn myself in.

778
01:35:01,095 --> 01:35:02,460
Here's my gun.

779
01:35:04,165 --> 01:35:05,962
I want something in return.

780
01:35:08,002 --> 01:35:10,493
I want to be able to bury my brother.

781
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:14,635
Suppose I don't agree to your terms?

782
01:35:16,677 --> 01:35:18,269
I'll kill you.

783
01:37:23,370 --> 01:37:25,998
"Jesse James, we understand

784
01:37:26,106 --> 01:37:28,006
"Has killed a many man

785
01:37:28,475 --> 01:37:32,206
"He robbed the Union trains

786
01:37:33,047 --> 01:37:34,947
"But history does record

787
01:37:35,082 --> 01:37:37,414
"That Bob and Charlie Ford

788
01:37:37,484 --> 01:37:41,079
"Have laid Jesse James in his grave

789
01:37:42,323 --> 01:37:44,587
"It was on a Saturday night

790
01:37:44,658 --> 01:37:46,853
"The stars were shining bright

01:37:46,927 --> 01:37:50,419

01:37:50,931 --> 01:37:53,729
"And it was one of the Younger boys

"That gathered in the spoils
