00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:27,935
Yee-ha!

2
00:02:30,647 --> 00:02:32,648
(gunfire continues)

3
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,085
- Can't he go any faster, Jesse?
- He's goin' fast enough, Ed.

4
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:55,419
(gunshots)

5
00:02:58,048 --> 00:03:00,925
- You watch them people, Frank.
- Shut up, Ed!

6
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:12,102
- What about that safe?
- There ain't no safe, Ed.

7
00:03:12,186 --> 00:03:14,604
All the money's in the strongbox
and in the cash drawers.

8
00:03:15,523 --> 00:03:18,441
I don't believe you.
You got a safe in here some place.

9
00:03:18,526 --> 00:03:22,070
Tell me where it is or I'm gonna
put a bullet in your brainpan.

10
00:03:22,154 --> 00:03:24,114
Get outta there, Ed.

11
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,033
Have you gone crazy, Ed?

12
00:03:29,954 --> 00:03:31,621
- (screams)
- Watch it, Jesse!

13
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,042
Jesse!

14
00:04:15,664 --> 00:04:18,166
How long will it take
that posse to get here?

15
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,542
There won't be one.

16
00:04:20,336 --> 00:04:22,003
They'll go about ten miles
and get tired,

17
00:04:22,087 --> 00:04:24,047
and go back and call the Pinkertons.

18
00:04:26,175 --> 00:04:27,925
How come we're standin' guard?

19
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,427
'Cause every once in a while I'm wrong.

20
00:04:35,767 --> 00:04:37,601
We'll take you upriver
to the Mimms' house.

21
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:40,228
Get the bullet out there.

22
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:43,940
You stay quiet now.

23
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:50,614
Come here, Ed.

24
00:05:05,128 --> 00:05:06,837
Jesse! Jesse!

25
00:05:09,132 --> 00:05:12,009
- Shit! What'd you do that for?
- Panickin' and shootin' innocent folks.

26
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:14,929
That's for goddamn
gettin' me near killed!

27
00:05:20,644 --> 00:05:22,310
Shit, I didn't mean no harm.

28
00:05:22,978 --> 00:05:26,481
You're through, Ed.
You ain't gonna ride with me no more.

29
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,279
Are you gonna take that off him?

30
00:05:34,824 --> 00:05:36,491
I seen what you done.

31
00:05:36,575 --> 00:05:40,036
You may be family,
but I ain't sidin' with ya.

32
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:42,122
You're on your own.

33
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:50,921
Cole, give him his cut.

34
00:06:11,526 --> 00:06:13,568
You threw yourself away a good livin'.

35
00:06:15,612 --> 00:06:17,113
Now listen good.

36
00:06:17,197 --> 00:06:20,324
Anybody connects the Jameses
or the Youngers with that bank,...

37

Yeah, I'd better go talk to this fella.

Well, I got a request of my own.

69
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:14,783
..scare some more
innocent folk half to death.

70
00:09:17,662 --> 00:09:21,915
- Never liked people standin' behind me.
- Most people would be flattered.

71
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:25,169
Ain't often
Belle Shirley stands behind a man.

72
00:09:27,255 --> 00:09:29,131
I reckon that's the truth.

73
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:44,687
Are you still askin' $15?

74
00:09:45,814 --> 00:09:47,231
I sure am.

75
00:09:50,903 --> 00:09:53,655
Well, ain't nothin' worth that price.

76
00:09:53,739 --> 00:09:57,158
Well, I don't figure I missed much.

77
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:03,039
But I'll tell you what I will do.

78
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,834
I'll go twelve and a half for you,
since you're about to go broke.

79
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,336
Huh.

80
00:10:11,255 --> 00:10:14,424
I only got eleven. I'll cut you for it.

81
00:10:15,593 --> 00:10:16,927
Make your move.

82
00:10:35,946 --> 00:10:37,655
I'll be go to hell.

83
00:10:41,576 --> 00:10:44,704
When your luck changes,
you feel free to call on me.

84
00:10:49,626 --> 00:10:51,293
Everybody ante up.

85
00:10:57,551 --> 00:11:00,343
Women... I love 'em.

86
00:11:02,847 --> 00:11:05,098
We was all in the war.

87
00:11:05,182 --> 00:11:09,978
Robbin' the first Yankee bank
because we didn't know no better.

88
00:11:10,062 --> 00:11:13,273
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

89
00:11:13,357 --> 00:11:16,484
After that we was...
just in the habit.

90
00:11:18,195 --> 00:11:20,739
So I guess we'll just...
keep on goin'...

91
00:11:21,824 --> 00:11:24,992
..till they lock us up or hang us.

92
00:11:45,722 --> 00:11:48,390
You've hardly given yourself
time enough to heal.

93
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,516
I gotta get back to things.

94
00:11:51,351 --> 00:11:53,811
Ma needs money
to help keep the farm goin'.

95
00:11:55,189 --> 00:11:59,108
I reckon your ma can keep the farm
goin' and a few more things to boot.

96
00:11:59,526 --> 00:12:02,278
Well, the others
ain't no good without me.

97
00:12:02,362 --> 00:12:05,072
They gotta have somebody
to make the plans.

98
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,911
But, uh... don't worry, Zee.

99
00:12:11,455 --> 00:12:13,247
I'm comin' back for ya.

100
00:12:14,374 --> 00:12:16,958
I thought you'd be over
with that Tebbs girl.

101
00:12:17,043 --> 00:12:19,795
Maybe I oughta be. She's awful pretty.

102
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:24,966
If you think so. Course, every
fella round here's been to visit her.

103
00:12:25,885 --> 00:12:28,136
I don't guess you
have that problem, Beth.

104
00:12:28,221 --> 00:12:30,639
I have just as many visitors as I want.

105
00:12:30,723 --> 00:12:33,975
- And you can count on it.
- Like who, for instance?

106
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,561
That's for me to know
and you to find out.

107
00:12:37,313 --> 00:12:39,147
How can I find out,
if you won't tell me?

108
00:12:39,232 --> 00:12:43,818
Jim Younger, there are some things
that a man does not ask a lady.

109
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:48,656
Beth, when you're old enough to call
yourself a lady, I'll keep that in mind.

110
00:12:52,244 --> 00:12:55,371
Think maybe we oughta get married?
Is that what you want?

111
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:01,752
It seems that you proposed to me
durin' the war, about seven years ago.

112
00:13:01,837 --> 00:13:03,712
That was different.

113
00:13:03,797 --> 00:13:05,756
Except, uh...

114
00:13:07,758 --> 00:13:10,677
..I always knew that...
you were the one.

115
00:13:10,761 --> 00:13:13,638
I just didn't have nothin'
worked out, that's all.

116
00:13:13,722 --> 00:13:16,808
That's a mouthful for Mr. Jesse James.

117
00:13:16,892 --> 00:13:19,394
Well, it's a mouthful of truth.

118
00:13:19,478 --> 00:13:22,814
What you gotta decide is if you
wanna get on the horse with me.

119
00:13:23,816 --> 00:13:27,443
I'm gonna be honest about it, Zee.
I ain't gonna change the way I live.

120
00:13:30,948 --> 00:13:35,284
Well, it ain't right
to try to change a person.

121
00:13:36,911 --> 00:13:39,746
Truth is, Jesse,
I wouldn't like you any other way.

122
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:54,386
Next thing you know,
they'll get married and settle down.

123
00:13:57,473 --> 00:14:01,017
First part, anyway.
He's askin' her today.

124
00:14:06,148 --> 00:14:08,190
It doesn't go with the way he's livin'.

125
00:14:08,817 --> 00:14:10,192
He'll be fine.

126
00:14:11,945 --> 00:14:14,530
First gettin' shot,
then gettin' married...

127
00:14:15,908 --> 00:14:17,491
Bad habits.

128
00:14:17,576 --> 00:14:22,580
I'd like to have a white dress
and a proper weddin'.

129
00:14:22,664 --> 00:14:28,585
- You want the whole county to be there.
- I do. A girl only gets married once.

130
00:14:48,272 --> 00:14:49,606
Yah!

131
00:14:53,777 --> 00:14:54,944
Giddyap!

132
00:15:04,663 --> 00:15:06,956
I never was the marryin' kind, myself.

133
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,291
Kind of life I lead,
women spell trouble.

134
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:12,211
Footloose and fancy-free,
that's my style.

135
00:15:12,295 --> 00:15:16,298
- What about you, friend?
- I ain't felt the call yet.

136
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:20,468
But if I was to meet a girl as pretty
as this one here, I could be persuaded.

137
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:25,223
I tell you something, mister. You best
watch your mouth, not look at my wife.

138
00:15:25,307 --> 00:15:28,643
Sorry. Didn't mean no disrespect.

139
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:31,270
Course he didn't.
He was just being polite.

140
00:15:31,355 --> 00:15:33,272
Hey, old man, put a cork in it a while.

141
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,234
Vernon, be polite.

142
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,841
Goddamn outlaws.

143
00:16:00,925 --> 00:16:03,510
Vernon, why don't you
hand that over here?

144
00:16:03,594 --> 00:16:06,471
Damn, you son of a bitch,
you're in it with 'em!

145
00:16:13,979 --> 00:16:15,813
I would toss that shotgun away.

146
00:16:24,156 --> 00:16:25,781
Throw down the box.

147
00:16:41,047 --> 00:16:44,549
- You men fight for the Stars and Bars?
- Yes, sir. Proud of it.

148
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:48,720
- May I shake your hand? Bob Younger.
- George. George Arthur.

149
00:16:48,804 --> 00:16:51,389
- Who were you with, George?
- General Jo Shelby.

150
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:53,641
What about you?

151
00:16:54,393 --> 00:16:57,062
- I was with Shelby too.
- Where?

152
00:16:57,146 --> 00:16:58,229
Cold Harbor.

153
00:16:58,314 --> 00:17:01,607
Shelby weren't at Cold Harbor.
You're a goddamn liar!

154
00:17:02,734 --> 00:17:06,195
- Shall I kill him?
- I would. I'd shoot the son of a bitch.

155
00:17:07,072 --> 00:17:11,408
- Bob, take everything he has.
- Everything.

156
00:17:11,493 --> 00:17:15,079
Let me give you a hand.
You're lucky you ain't dead.

157

You might say I'm interested
in the same thing, Mr. Reddick.

285
00:32:08,146 --> 00:32:10,063
What do you think your chances are
of bringin' 'em in?

286
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:13,191
That's an amazingly stupid question.

287
00:32:45,348 --> 00:32:47,224
I want your sons, Mrs. Samuel.

288
00:32:47,308 --> 00:32:51,144
- What do you want 'em for?
- For robbin' banks and trains, ma'am.

289
00:32:51,229 --> 00:32:54,439
Well, you Yankees can just
turn around and head on back.

290
00:32:54,524 --> 00:32:56,858

291
00:32:56,943 --> 00:33:01,737
Yes, ma'am. I am a Yankee and
a city man. But these men are southern.

292
00:33:01,822 --> 00:33:06,409
- They were with the Stars and Bars.
- So what are they chasin' my boys for?

293
00:33:06,493 --> 00:33:10,705
They steal, ma'am. I'm gonna
have to go in there and look for 'em.

294
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:12,665
This paper gives me
the right to do that.

295

backward baby boy...

297
00:33:24,845 --> 00:33:27,595
..gets treated like this
and they call it legal!

298
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,639
I am sorry, ma'am.

299
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:37,439
How come I never been asked?

300
00:33:38,315 --> 00:33:40,608
Maybe you ain't cut out for it.

301
00:33:41,444 --> 00:33:43,737
Besides, we got enough hands
the way it is.

302
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:47,699
Keep me in mind. I can rob banks as
good as the Millers or your brother Bob.

303
00:33:47,783 --> 00:33:50,118
- Ain't nothin' to it.
- Think so?

304
00:33:50,202 --> 00:33:55,205
What's to know about robbin' a bank?
You ride into town, guns blazin',...

305
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:58,417
..scarin' the Jesus
out of everyone until they're frozen,...

306
00:33:58,501 --> 00:34:01,837
..ride right in the bank on your horse,
dynamite the safe...

307
00:34:01,921 --> 00:34:03,547
..and ride off with the loot,
hootin' an' hollerin'...

308
00:34:03,631 --> 00:34:05,466
..the same damn way you came in.

309
00:34:26,737 --> 00:34:27,737
Good afternoon.

310
00:34:28,864 --> 00:34:30,281
Afternoon.

311
00:34:34,161 --> 00:34:36,245
What's the trouble, friend?

312
00:34:37,915 --> 00:34:42,293
No trouble. We're looking for
the Youngers. Do you know them?

313
00:34:45,088 --> 00:34:46,088
Sure I do.

314
00:34:47,173 --> 00:34:48,924
A lot of 'em around these parts.

315
00:34:49,008 --> 00:34:51,176
Big family.

316
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:55,555
- Who are you fellas?
- Come here to buy cattle.

317
00:34:59,435 --> 00:35:00,852
This ain't Texas.

318
00:35:02,522 --> 00:35:04,064
What about the Youngers?

319
00:35:05,191 --> 00:35:09,444
You're lookin' at two of 'em.
You ain't here to buy cattle.

320
00:35:09,529 --> 00:35:11,195
Now who are you fellas?

321
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:14,448
Goddamn Pinkertons!

322
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:18,828
- Which Younger are you?
- Question is, who are you?

323
00:35:19,913 --> 00:35:23,124
I told ya. We're cattle buyers.

324
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:26,877
How dumb do you think we are?
You're Pinkerton men!

325
00:35:26,962 --> 00:35:29,672
I'm Jim Younger.
This here's my cousin John.

326
00:35:29,756 --> 00:35:31,590
You ain't lookin' for him.
He don't ride with us.

327
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:34,635
Is that right?

328
00:35:55,656 --> 00:35:57,532
Go! Ha!

329
00:36:15,758 --> 00:36:20,012
I told ya he was my cousin.
He never rode with us once.

330
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,472
18 year old, I gotta take him
back to his family, dead.

331
00:36:23,308 --> 00:36:24,892
You broke the law.

332
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:50,374
People say they got one of the Youngers.

333
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:53,794
People say they got the wrong Younger.

334
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,604
All right, everybody ready?
Wait for 'em to come out.

335
00:37:27,535 --> 00:37:28,535
God...

336
00:37:40,298 --> 00:37:43,175
- What in the hell happened?
- I don't know.

337
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,302
We put a smoke in the cabin.

338
00:37:45,387 --> 00:37:47,428
All of a sudden it blew.

339
00:37:47,513 --> 00:37:50,682
The only thing we meant to do
was drive 'em out to us.

340
00:37:52,017 --> 00:37:55,645
- Now you are sure it was not a bomb?
- Oh, no, it wasn't no bomb.

341
00:37:57,481 --> 00:38:01,609
The old lady must have thrown it in
her fireplace and the kerosene went up.

342
00:38:01,694 --> 00:38:03,236
That's the only thing I can figure.

343
00:38:04,196 --> 00:38:07,407
Killing a simple-minded,
15-year-old boy.

344
00:38:07,491 --> 00:38:11,286
You men did an excellent job in making
heroes out of every one of those men.

345
00:39:39,662 --> 00:39:42,998
Archie Peyton Samuel
was an innocent boy.

346
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:47,544
It's a sad day when murder is committed
in the name of justice.

347
00:39:48,755 --> 00:39:52,466
This act tries the forbearance
of good Christian men.

348
00:39:53,343 --> 00:39:56,260
We commend
this child's body to the ground.

349
00:39:56,345 --> 00:39:59,430
His soul belongs to the Lord.

350
00:40:57,946 --> 00:41:00,739
Beth... Ed.

351
00:41:02,409 --> 00:41:04,201
You didn't bring no gun.

352
00:41:05,871 --> 00:41:07,997
I ain't got no quarrel
with the Pinkertons.

353
00:41:09,624 --> 00:41:13,252
I'm sorry about what
happened to Archie, but, uh...

354
00:41:14,086 --> 00:41:17,589
..since you boys kicked me out,
you can just fight your own fights.

355
00:41:19,467 --> 00:41:21,342
Is that how you feel about it, Beth?

356
00:41:25,681 --> 00:41:29,309
- No, it ain't.
- Come on. I've had enough talkin' here.

357
00:41:29,393 --> 00:41:31,144
You go your own way.

358
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:35,815
Now you hold it.
You gotta learn to mind me.

359
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,400
Ed,...

360
00:41:38,777 --> 00:41:40,360
..start walkin'.

361
00:41:50,663 --> 00:41:52,456
Is that what you want, Beth?

362
00:41:58,796 --> 00:42:00,631
Then to hell with you.

363
00:42:05,427 --> 00:42:07,428
To hell with both of you.

364
00:42:29,201 --> 00:42:32,452
Awful sorry about
your little brother. Sorry.

365
00:42:41,629 --> 00:42:45,632
Just rest now. We're gonna take you
over to Schofield's house directly.

366
00:42:48,678 --> 00:42:49,719
I'm sorry, Ma.

367
00:42:51,097 --> 00:42:52,764
I'm so sorry.

368
00:42:55,518 --> 00:42:57,518
Are you gonna make 'em pay, Jesse?

369
00:43:51,487 --> 00:43:52,779
You got it wrong.

370
00:43:52,864 --> 00:43:55,449
- We didn't do nothin'.
- Yes, you did.

371
00:43:56,034 --> 00:43:59,119
Some of our friends saw you
on the north road that night.

372
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:04,958
Please, mister, it wasn't really a bomb.
It was supposed to smoke everybody out.

373
00:44:10,298 --> 00:44:12,883
My little brother was 15 years old.

374
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:15,384
Now you think about that...

375
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,346
..on your way to hell.

376
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:37,239
The funeral will be in Chicago
and the governor will be there.

377
00:44:37,324 --> 00:44:40,910
Well, I'm sure it'll cheer their souls
just to hear you say that.

378
00:44:40,994 --> 00:44:43,953
It'd cheer them to know how many men
we have out combin' those hills.

379
00:44:45,414 --> 00:44:47,874
Those boys got
a lot of friends out there.

380
00:45:21,908 --> 00:45:23,534
What are these two doin' here?

381
00:45:24,285 --> 00:45:27,621
Visitin'. You got a law against that?

382
00:45:27,706 --> 00:45:30,374
No, ma'am. I got a law against murder.

383
00:45:30,458 --> 00:45:32,209
I got a warrant right here.

384
00:45:32,293 --> 00:45:35,044
I don't suppose it'd do me
any good to ask polite.

385
00:45:35,129 --> 00:45:38,005
It won't do you any good to ask at all.

386
00:45:38,799 --> 00:45:42,427
These men of yours are gonna end up
dead. Or they're gonna end up worse.

387
00:45:43,846 --> 00:45:46,180
You ladies are gonna be left
all alone just to think about it.

388
00:45:48,142 --> 00:45:49,475
Mr. Rowe!

389
00:45:50,769 --> 00:45:53,187
I want people in the house
and in the wood!

390
00:45:53,272 --> 00:45:55,690
All right, men, off your horses.
Let's go.

391
00:46:06,909 --> 00:46:08,827
(cock crows)

392
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:19,296
Sooey! Sooey!

393
00:46:31,516 --> 00:46:32,850
Mornin', boys.

394
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:36,187
Mornin', Cole.

395
00:46:40,609 --> 00:46:43,110
You boys waste the best part of the day.

396
00:46:43,737 --> 00:46:47,031
Hard to say y'all farm-bred
the way you sleep in.

397
00:46:47,783 --> 00:46:49,658
What's for breakfast?

398
00:46:49,743 --> 00:46:52,035
Grits. Cracklin' grits.

399
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:53,995
Had 'em yesterday.

400
00:46:56,165 --> 00:46:59,501
- I'm sick of this damn hidin' out.
- Who ain't?

401
00:47:00,044 --> 00:47:03,713
Better mind your manners, Bob.
And thank McCorkindale here.

402
00:47:03,798 --> 00:47:05,632
Don't be pickin' on Bob, Jesse.

403
00:47:05,716 --> 00:47:09,302
- Hey, shut up, Jim.
- Shut up yourself, Frank.

404
00:47:09,386 --> 00:47:11,930
I ain't got nothin' but respect
for Mr. McCorkindale.

405
00:47:14,391 --> 00:47:17,226
You boys just got holed-up fever,
I know it.

406
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:19,603
All y'all need is some fresh air.

407
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:23,482
I'll get y'all some milk
as soon as I feed the chickens.

408
00:47:30,406 --> 00:47:32,115
(braying)

409
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,742
(gunshot)

410
00:48:03,856 --> 00:48:05,898
- What about McCorkindale?
- Dead.

411
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:08,276
- You sure?
- He's dead.

412
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,776
Piss on ya.

413
00:48:15,616 --> 00:48:16,992
Cover him, dammit!

414
00:48:42,183 --> 00:48:44,685
Next volley, we go.
Frank's hurt. He goes first.

415
00:50:22,697 --> 00:50:26,533
♫ Where there's no more
stormy clouds arising

416
00:50:27,076 --> 00:50:32,956
♫ He whom I fix my hopes upon

417
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:39,004
♫ Where there's no more
stormy clouds arising

418
00:50:39,088 --> 00:50:42,799
♫ His track I'll see

419
00:50:42,883 --> 00:50:45,217
♫ And I'll pursue

420
00:50:45,301 --> 00:50:46,969
♫ Where there's no more...

421
00:50:47,053 --> 00:50:51,724
What is your full name, Mrs. Samuel?
My paper would like to get it right.

422
00:50:53,101 --> 00:50:55,477
Zerelda Cole Samuel.

423
00:50:56,688 --> 00:50:59,857
My husband, Robert James,
died in California.

424
00:51:00,942 --> 00:51:04,194
My second husband
was called Reuben Samuel.

425
00:51:04,279 --> 00:51:07,865
And where did you and Mr. Samuel live?

426
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:10,783
Clay County, Missouri.

427
00:51:10,868 --> 00:51:13,036
Are you the mother of Jesse James?

428
00:51:14,121 --> 00:51:16,205
I am.

429
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:21,377
♫ Track I'll see and I'll pursue

430
00:51:21,462 --> 00:51:25,465
♫ Where there's no more stormy clouds...

431
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:29,302
Mrs. Samuel,
you've already lost one son.

432
00:51:30,345 --> 00:51:34,140
Aren't you afraid the other two will
end up the same as McCorkindale?

433
00:51:50,865 --> 00:51:53,700
Ed, you identify the James boys or
the Youngers, there might be a reward.

434
00:51:57,705 --> 00:52:00,540
- How much?
- A couple of thousand dollars.

435
00:52:03,376 --> 00:52:04,835
Shit.

436
00:52:06,963 --> 00:52:09,090
Well, I got a question for you.

437
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,593
How do I identify what you can't catch?

438
00:52:12,677 --> 00:52:15,596
They'll be caught. Jesse and his boys
are done with you anyway.

439
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,849
Let me tell you one damn thing.

440
00:52:20,185 --> 00:52:23,562
I turn 'em in and I'm gonna get killed
by one of their relatives, sure as hell.

441
00:52:23,647 --> 00:52:27,066
I got six months to go
for bustin' up a place drunk,...

442
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:29,526
..so I'm just gonna
take my chances, all right?

443
00:52:31,403 --> 00:52:35,657
Besides, Jesse might change his mind
and he pays better wages than you do,...

444
00:52:35,741 --> 00:52:37,742
..Pinkerton man.

445
00:52:42,373 --> 00:52:45,333
Frank, I never
saw myself as a farm girl.

446
00:52:45,417 --> 00:52:48,628
You ain't gonna be farmin', Annie.
You're gonna raise horses.

447
00:52:48,712 --> 00:52:51,631
I don't know anythin'
about raisin' horses, either.

448
00:52:51,715 --> 00:52:53,882
You know, it's funny.
Outside of bein' a banker,...

449
00:52:53,967 --> 00:52:57,177
..all I wanted to do
was to raise horses.

450
00:52:57,262 --> 00:53:00,222
Well, thanks to the Pinkertons,
you're gettin' your chance.

451
00:53:02,058 --> 00:53:05,477
We're not the only ones goin'
our own way. Everybody's doin' it.

452
00:53:05,562 --> 00:53:09,606
Jim Younger's off in the hills.
God only knows where Jesse is.

453
00:53:09,691 --> 00:53:11,733
Bob and Cole are headin' for Texas.

454
00:53:11,818 --> 00:53:13,986
The only reason
Cole went to Texas

455
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:16,989
was he heard Belle Shirley
got married there.

456
00:53:17,073 --> 00:53:21,534
It's a long way to go lookin' for
trouble. We'll be just fine, Annie.

457
00:53:22,077 --> 00:53:23,411
Come on, mule!

458
00:53:27,416 --> 00:53:29,250
(♫ country music)

459
00:54:21,927 --> 00:54:23,385
You're late.

460
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:26,347
I'm not much for bein' on time.

461
00:54:27,974 --> 00:54:29,850
You don't look real happy.

462
00:54:29,935 --> 00:54:32,686
Well, I'll tell ya somethin'
about Texas.

463
00:54:32,771 --> 00:54:34,271
It's loud.

464
00:54:34,356 --> 00:54:37,358
Well, I never figured you
for the homesick type.

465
00:54:37,442 --> 00:54:41,778
I ain't the homesick type.
I ain't the waitin' around type, either.

466
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:44,405
I ain't the reliable type.

467
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:47,075
Well, you oughta try gettin' married.

468
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:50,078
Might improve your character.

469
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:53,081
What do you do with that...
husband of yours?

470
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:55,750
Leave him home, tied to the bed?

471
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:58,002
Don't you make no fun of him.

472
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,423
The way I got it figured,
you're gonna wear that Indian out.

473
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:05,968
That double thump
and side swoop of yours.

474
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:09,680
I do what I want with who I want
and don't make no mistake about it.

475
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:12,140
Everybody says that
and they always have.

476
00:55:15,144 --> 00:55:18,105
Now you wanna see somethin',
you watch this.

477
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:19,564
Come here!

478
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:29,490
- You done?
- Not by a damn sight.

479
00:55:34,413 --> 00:55:35,788
(music stops)

480
00:55:44,715 --> 00:55:46,007
Now are you done?

481
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:48,384
(gunshot)

482
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:55,057
Sam.

483
00:55:56,851 --> 00:55:58,476
You Cole Younger?

484
00:55:58,561 --> 00:56:00,186
Who's askin'?

485
00:56:01,147 --> 00:56:04,733
Sam Starr. I'm married to that lady.

486
00:56:06,402 --> 00:56:07,527
Pleased to meet ya.

487
00:56:09,655 --> 00:56:13,658
Well now, boys, there is no need
to fight over little old me.

488
00:56:13,743 --> 00:56:17,203
But if you've got to,
you make it man-to-man.

489
00:56:19,915 --> 00:56:21,790
Hand-to-hand.

490
00:56:25,795 --> 00:56:27,087
Why not?

491
00:56:37,432 --> 00:56:38,557
Well,...

492
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,561
..I'm glad I caught ya in a good mood.

493
00:56:55,157 --> 00:56:58,576
Here you go, both of you. Have a chew.

494
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:04,332
- What does the winner get?
- Nothin' you both ain't already had.

495
00:57:07,336 --> 00:57:09,754
It don't make much sense, does it?

496
00:57:11,465 --> 00:57:14,091
No. You're both crazy.

497
00:57:15,385 --> 00:57:17,636
But you keep me occupied.

498
00:57:19,055 --> 00:57:21,723
I am having a real good time.

499
00:57:25,853 --> 00:57:27,687
Ten bucks on the half-breed!

500
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:47,598
Come on, redskin!

501
00:59:11,121 --> 00:59:12,955
Come on, Missouri.

502
01:00:09,886 --> 01:00:11,679
What's the matter?

503
01:00:16,684 --> 01:00:18,351
You got what you wanted.

504
01:00:37,162 --> 01:00:39,163
(♫ music strikes up)

505
01:00:47,338 --> 01:00:51,091
- Sir, we met a few months back.
- I remember.

506
01:00:51,175 --> 01:00:53,468
I'd like to ask you a couple
of questions for my newspaper,

507
01:00:53,553 --> 01:00:54,928
if you don't mind.

508
01:00:55,847 --> 01:00:59,057
Like why you're havin' so much trouble
bringin' in the James-Younger gang.

509
01:01:01,019 --> 01:01:05,063
A lot of reasons. I came here with
four men that didn't know the territory.

510
01:01:05,148 --> 01:01:06,648
They were murdered.

511
01:01:06,732 --> 01:01:10,443
Most of the people here are related
to each other, so they're clannish.

512
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:12,320
What about the local police?

513
01:01:12,404 --> 01:01:16,198
Local police get tired and quit
after chasin' the gang a coupla miles.

514
01:01:17,284 --> 01:01:21,287
Also, newspapers like your own print
lies, sayin' they're Robin Hoods.

515
01:01:21,371 --> 01:01:23,414
That doesn't help a great deal, either.

516
01:01:23,498 --> 01:01:26,626
My readers may ask why
you're sittin' next to a warm fire...

517
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:28,294
..when you should be out on the chase.

518
01:01:29,504 --> 01:01:32,256
Right now the bunch
are spread out across five states.

519
01:01:32,341 --> 01:01:34,049
But they will be back.

520
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,015
Zee, did you have
any visitors while I was gone?

521
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:29,185
You mean was anyone

522
01:02:29,269 --> 01:02:32,230
tryin' to straighten up your sheets
and fluff your pillow?

523
01:02:32,314 --> 01:02:36,359
- I'm just askin'.
- Mind your manners, Mr. Jesse James.

524
01:02:36,443 --> 01:02:38,361
Just 'cause you're off fightin'
railroads and banks,

525
01:02:38,445 --> 01:02:40,863
don't mean you get a free tongue.

526
01:02:43,409 --> 01:02:47,453
I sent out word to the rest.
We're gonna be meetin' up real soon.

527
01:02:48,539 --> 01:02:50,248
We're goin' on a mission.

528
01:02:52,792 --> 01:02:54,960
I'm gonna get myself some cash...

529
01:02:57,255 --> 01:03:00,340
..and start lookin' around Missouri
for some girl to marry.

530
01:03:02,844 --> 01:03:04,136
Any prospects?

531
01:03:06,431 --> 01:03:07,639
I'm lookin'.

532
01:03:20,902 --> 01:03:22,445
I don't know, Annie.

533
01:03:23,447 --> 01:03:26,240
Maybe we're just goin'
in different directions.

534
01:03:27,492 --> 01:03:31,495
Maybe so. Can't help
wantin' what we want, can we?

535
01:03:32,664 --> 01:03:33,956
Yeah.

536
01:03:35,333 --> 01:03:40,629
Well, my going's got
nothin' to do with big dreams.

537
01:03:40,714 --> 01:03:43,673
Nobody ever made you go
anywhere you didn't wanna go, Frank.

538
01:03:49,221 --> 01:03:50,513
Good night.

539
01:04:09,908 --> 01:04:12,534
- How are you doin', Jim?
- I'm doin' OK.

540
01:04:21,878 --> 01:04:24,004
So, gents, let's get down to it.

541
01:04:24,088 --> 01:04:26,256
What's our next job gonna be?

542
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:34,639
Minnesota. Them squareheads,
they got 'em a real fat bank up there.

543
01:04:35,641 --> 01:04:39,602
I scouted it out myself. Northfield.

544
01:04:41,772 --> 01:04:46,067
A lot of banks and cathouses
in Missouri we ain't done.

545
01:04:48,529 --> 01:04:51,489
Cole's right. Minnesota...

546
01:04:52,491 --> 01:04:54,116
It's a fair piece off our mark.

547
01:04:54,910 --> 01:04:59,372
Well, Clell says that bank's full to the
brim with money. That sounds good to me.

548
01:04:59,456 --> 01:05:00,580
(door opens)

549
01:05:03,584 --> 01:05:07,838
I want Bill Chadwell and Charley Pitts
to go with us. They're goddamn good men.

550
01:05:09,298 --> 01:05:11,675
- Who says?
- I do.

551
01:06:07,146 --> 01:06:08,980
I used to do this all the time.

552
01:06:10,649 --> 01:06:12,066
But, uh...

553
01:06:14,486 --> 01:06:16,988
I got married a few years back.

554
01:06:18,156 --> 01:06:22,910
I guess it slowed me down a bit,
if you know what I mean.

555
01:06:48,727 --> 01:06:50,186
Mornin', Jess.

556
01:06:55,859 --> 01:06:58,110
Hope you boys
had a good time last night.

557
01:06:58,195 --> 01:07:00,363
How was yours?

558
01:07:01,365 --> 01:07:03,532
I got better things to think about.

559
01:07:07,537 --> 01:07:09,038
Family man.

560
01:07:11,290 --> 01:07:14,709
My family's somethin'
you don't talk about, Cole Younger.

561
01:07:56,084 --> 01:07:59,003
♫ Well, I walked the street
with a tap to my feet

562
01:07:59,087 --> 01:08:01,672
♫ Heard a voice above me

563
01:08:01,755 --> 01:08:04,007
♫ A maid looked out
from a window up above

564
01:08:04,091 --> 01:08:06,634
♫ Said need somebody to love me

565
01:08:06,719 --> 01:08:09,012
♫ My father he's a minister

566
01:08:09,096 --> 01:08:11,514
♫ And virgins he doth cherish

567
01:08:11,598 --> 01:08:14,017
♫ Now she got five boys
and seven little girls

568
01:08:14,101 --> 01:08:16,894
♫ And a baby on her shoulder

569
01:08:26,196 --> 01:08:31,366
Well, Frank, when this is all over,
I think I'll write me a book.

570
01:08:31,451 --> 01:08:34,494
Make myself
even more famous than I am.

571
01:08:36,330 --> 01:08:38,623
If a pig had wings, it would fly.

572
01:08:39,709 --> 01:08:43,003
Nah. A book about my exploits...

573
01:08:44,297 --> 01:08:46,131
..as a gentleman and a lover.

574
01:08:48,634 --> 01:08:51,303
- I expect a free copy.
- Free copy?

575
01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:58,768
You gotta pay, Frank. Gotta pay.

576
01:09:01,313 --> 01:09:03,939
Have you ever been up north before?

577
01:09:04,024 --> 01:09:06,108
Got to Fetterman once.

578
01:09:06,193 --> 01:09:09,737
- Went to shoot buffalo.
- How'd you do?

579
01:09:09,821 --> 01:09:13,699
The price of hides went to hell
and I got the clap off some squaw.

580
01:10:07,001 --> 01:10:09,294
The bank's plumb in the center
of town,...

581
01:10:09,379 --> 01:10:12,630
..right between the dry goods store
and the mortuary.

582
01:10:12,714 --> 01:10:17,176
You reckon we oughta send in
a coupla scouts, check it all out?

583
01:10:17,261 --> 01:10:20,263
We rob banks, Jim.
We don't need any checkin'.

584
01:10:20,347 --> 01:10:23,349
You're talkin' soft,
somethin' I'd expect from Cole or Frank.

585
01:10:24,768 --> 01:10:27,770
I gave up tryin' to talk
sense to you a long time ago.

586
01:10:37,488 --> 01:10:39,489
Come on, let's take the damn bank.

587
01:10:39,574 --> 01:10:42,409
There ain't nothin' over there
but squareheads.

588
01:12:32,391 --> 01:12:34,350
(steam engine whistle)

589
01:13:51,925 --> 01:13:53,885
All right, good people, nobody move.

590
01:13:55,262 --> 01:13:57,638
Let's just show God
the palms of our hands.

591
01:13:57,723 --> 01:13:59,932
Now you don't give us
no trouble, mister.

592
01:14:00,434 --> 01:14:01,726
Clell, get to the vault.

593
01:14:08,775 --> 01:14:12,527
- Är den här hästen till salu?
- He's not for sale.

594
01:14:12,612 --> 01:14:13,987
Move on, squarehead.

595
01:14:20,995 --> 01:14:24,373
OK, now you open this safe
or I'll blow your head right off.

596
01:14:24,457 --> 01:14:26,500
I can't. It's a time lock.

597
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:32,338
- What are you talkin' about?
- Time lock, hell!

598
01:14:32,422 --> 01:14:34,423
You open that safe, mister, you hear?

599
01:14:35,717 --> 01:14:38,427
The Pinkertons told us
you might be comin'.

600
01:14:38,512 --> 01:14:41,597
The lock is set just for you.
It only works at 4:30.

601
01:14:42,933 --> 01:14:44,558
The whole town is ready.

602
01:14:56,363 --> 01:14:59,114
No, mister, please don't shoot.
I have a family.

603
01:15:00,241 --> 01:15:03,034
Now, you got five seconds
to open up that vault, mister.

604
01:15:05,955 --> 01:15:07,622
Hur mycket ska ni ha för den?

605
01:15:07,706 --> 01:15:10,125
What the hell...? Get outta here!

606
01:15:11,710 --> 01:15:15,130
Det var synd. Det var eu vacker häst.

607
01:15:17,341 --> 01:15:20,385
- (woman screams)
- Be quiet, lady!

608
01:15:24,347 --> 01:15:25,347
(woman screams)

609
01:15:25,974 --> 01:15:28,267
- They're robbin' the bank!
- Jesus, Clell!

610
01:15:28,351 --> 01:15:31,520
They're robbin' the bank!

611
01:15:55,878 --> 01:15:58,171
- Let's get the hell outta here.
- Come on, Clell.

612
01:16:15,897 --> 01:16:17,063
Yankee bastard!

613
01:16:24,071 --> 01:16:25,405
Jim!

614
01:16:26,657 --> 01:16:27,824
Bob!

615
01:20:00,488 --> 01:20:03,615
Cole! Jesse!

616
01:22:17,619 --> 01:22:19,203
We gotta move, Frank.

617
01:22:20,872 --> 01:22:23,249
They'll get the rest of 'em to a doctor.

618
01:22:25,585 --> 01:22:29,171
- Who will?
- The posse that's gonna be chasin' us.

619
01:22:30,173 --> 01:22:33,217
We can't do that.
We can’t just leave 'em here alone.

620
01:22:48,482 --> 01:22:50,942
Jim, Cole,...

621
01:22:54,113 --> 01:22:55,530
..we gotta ride.

622
01:22:59,451 --> 01:23:00,702
What about the rest of 'em?

623
01:23:00,786 --> 01:23:03,413
This just ain't no time
to argue, Cole.

624
01:23:06,208 --> 01:23:09,043
Either you stay here an' die
or you come with us.

625
01:23:10,795 --> 01:23:12,296
Frank an' I are goin'.

626
01:23:40,490 --> 01:23:43,618
Kill me! Kill me, goddamn it!

627
01:23:44,703 --> 01:23:45,870
Frank.

628
01:23:51,251 --> 01:23:52,793
You're not leavin', are ya?

629
01:23:57,633 --> 01:23:59,550
I gotta stick with my brother, Cole.

630
01:24:21,197 --> 01:24:23,031
The Youngers don't need you.

631
01:25:05,781 --> 01:25:07,907
I like it better this way, Jesse.

632
01:25:09,743 --> 01:25:11,452
I get to see you run.

633
01:25:54,619 --> 01:25:57,121
Jim... Oh, Cole!

634
01:25:57,205 --> 01:26:01,167
Yeah, we're here, Bobby boy.
We're all here.

635
01:26:03,170 --> 01:26:05,546
Goddamn squareheads.

636
01:26:27,693 --> 01:26:29,778
Where the hell's Missouri?

637
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:59,155
Come on, Frank.

638
01:28:00,532 --> 01:28:03,742
We're gonna get us a new gang together.
It's gonna be better than ever.

639
01:28:04,244 --> 01:28:06,704
Now you're not gonna quit on me now.

640
01:28:09,708 --> 01:28:11,834
All we gotta do is get across the river.

641
01:28:11,918 --> 01:28:14,211
All we gotta do is get home.

642
01:28:17,507 --> 01:28:19,091
We never shoulda left.

643
01:29:03,968 --> 01:29:06,470
You could say we was drove to it.

644
01:29:07,639 --> 01:29:11,141
Oh? How's that?

645
01:29:11,601 --> 01:29:15,436
If it weren't for the war,
we might have been somethin' else.

646
01:29:17,522 --> 01:29:20,399
You're a little too young
to have fought in the war.

647
01:29:20,484 --> 01:29:24,237
But my brothers weren't,
and we all go one direction together.

648
01:29:24,321 --> 01:29:27,240
You tell me who they are
and it might mean a lighter sentence.

649
01:29:27,324 --> 01:29:28,741
Think about that.

650
01:29:28,825 --> 01:29:31,535
You and I both know it was
the James boys, don't we, Cole?

651
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:34,330
Sure do feel poorly.

652
01:29:36,166 --> 01:29:39,084
Ain't a surprise. Eleven bullets
must be some kinda record.

653
01:29:40,253 --> 01:29:42,587
What do you think about a life sentence?

654
01:29:42,672 --> 01:29:44,881
You're lucky they don't allow
hangin' in this state.

655
01:29:46,550 --> 01:29:49,094
Come on, Cole.
Tell me what you think about all this.

656
01:29:55,017 --> 01:29:57,185
Oh, hell, we played a rough game.

657
01:29:57,270 --> 01:29:58,895
We lost.

658
01:30:00,940 --> 01:30:02,983
I spent four years in the army.

659
01:30:03,067 --> 01:30:05,818
Eleven tryin' to get out of it.

660
01:30:06,528 --> 01:30:09,238
What about the James boys?

661
01:30:11,241 --> 01:30:13,867
- I don't know nothin' about 'em.
- Sure you do.

662
01:30:15,996 --> 01:30:18,706
As far as I'm concerned,
they never been in this state.

663
01:30:32,469 --> 01:30:34,220
Are you another reporter?

664
01:30:35,097 --> 01:30:38,641
No. My name's Jacob Rixley.
I'm with the Pinkerton agency.

665
01:30:38,726 --> 01:30:41,269
I been chasin' you boys
for a long time, Bob.

666
01:30:42,271 --> 01:30:44,105
Yes, sir, I guess you have.

667
01:30:44,857 --> 01:30:46,983
I wanna talk to you
about the James boys.

668
01:30:47,067 --> 01:30:49,319
You don't owe them a thing, you know.

669
01:30:49,403 --> 01:30:52,822
If it was them, they wouldn't
protect you to get them one day less.

670
01:30:52,906 --> 01:30:55,700
But unless you help me,

671
01:30:56,327 --> 01:30:58,910
you and your brothers
are gonna be in this jail for life.

672
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:02,664
(Jim) Uh-uh.

673
01:31:05,084 --> 01:31:06,543
What's he tryin' to say?

674
01:31:08,338 --> 01:31:11,423
He said to tell you we done it
for Dixie and nothin' else.

675
01:31:13,968 --> 01:31:16,178
15,000 for Jesse.

676
01:31:16,262 --> 01:31:18,597
Another 10,000 will get you Frank.

677
01:31:21,017 --> 01:31:23,768
The Pinkerton company and
the governor can't afford that.

678
01:31:23,852 --> 01:31:28,606
You know who you're talkin' to?
You know who sprung out of Missouri?

679
01:31:28,690 --> 01:31:31,609
Jameses, Youngers, Clantons, Earps.

680
01:31:32,110 --> 01:31:34,236
And now Bob and Charlie Ford.

681
01:31:34,321 --> 01:31:37,031
Word's out that you and Jesse
aren't friends, anyway.

682
01:31:37,115 --> 01:31:41,035
Is that so? Well,
that very same Mr. Jesse James...

683
01:31:41,119 --> 01:31:44,080
..that you can't find at all
just asked us to come and visit him.

684
01:31:46,833 --> 01:31:48,500
Let's go, Bob.

685
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:51,127
Wait a minute.

686
01:31:52,296 --> 01:31:54,089
$15,000.

687
01:31:54,965 --> 01:31:56,966
Half before and half when it's done.

688
01:31:58,094 --> 01:31:59,636
Got yourself a deal.

689
01:32:05,893 --> 01:32:07,352
No more for me.

690
01:32:10,731 --> 01:32:13,441
Heard you were thinkin'
about a bank in Kansas, Jesse.

691
01:32:14,567 --> 01:32:16,819
You don't talk business
at the table, Bob.

692
01:32:18,530 --> 01:32:19,655
Sorry.

693
01:32:25,078 --> 01:32:26,537
Say, how'd you boys like a drink?

694
01:32:26,621 --> 01:32:28,497
Sounds good.

695
01:32:29,666 --> 01:32:32,251
- Don't it, Bob?
- Sure thing.

696
01:32:33,670 --> 01:32:35,921
Could I have your plate, please, Jesse?

697
01:32:40,426 --> 01:32:41,801
Charlie.

698
01:32:52,813 --> 01:32:56,357
- Are you feelin' all right?
- She ain't real fond of the company.

699
01:32:59,736 --> 01:33:01,487
Don't worry none, ladies.

700
01:33:01,572 --> 01:33:04,157
Just talkin' some things over,
that's all.

701
01:33:14,041 --> 01:33:15,417
Can you say good night?

702
01:33:15,501 --> 01:33:17,294
Good night.

703
01:33:25,470 --> 01:33:28,930
He might be carryin' a hide-out.
I bet he is.

704
01:33:30,224 --> 01:33:33,767
He knows. I know he knows.

705
01:33:39,399 --> 01:33:41,066
Pour me one, Bob.

706
01:33:45,655 --> 01:33:47,406
You look spooked, Charlie.

707
01:33:48,992 --> 01:33:50,451
Like hell.

708
01:33:51,369 --> 01:33:53,579
Nothin' spooks me, Jesse.
You know that.

709
01:33:58,375 --> 01:34:01,127
Now I've been thinkin'
about the Platte City bank.

710
01:34:01,212 --> 01:34:03,588
It's gonna be a big one.

711
01:34:03,672 --> 01:34:05,131
We ain't too sure.

712
01:34:06,133 --> 01:34:08,968
- Why not?
- I don't know.

713
01:34:09,053 --> 01:34:11,763
You're a hard man
to do business with, Jesse.

714
01:34:15,726 --> 01:34:17,477
It's crooked.

715
01:34:18,187 --> 01:34:19,187
What'd you say?

716
01:34:20,773 --> 01:34:22,398
I said, it's not straight.

717
01:34:28,446 --> 01:34:30,489
I really like this old sampler.

718
01:34:31,157 --> 01:34:33,492
Ma gave this to me for my weddin' day.

719
01:34:37,622 --> 01:34:38,956
Is that straight?

720
01:34:40,375 --> 01:34:42,251
I shot Jesse James.

721
01:34:49,342 --> 01:34:52,009
- Mr. Rixley?
- That's right.

722
01:34:53,303 --> 01:34:54,971
My name is Frank James.

723
01:34:57,975 --> 01:34:59,976
I came here to turn myself in.

724
01:35:02,354 --> 01:35:03,854
Here's my gun.

725
01:35:05,482 --> 01:35:07,191
I want something in return.

726
01:35:09,361 --> 01:35:11,487
I want to be able to bury my brother.

727
01:35:13,699 --> 01:35:15,658
Suppose I don't agree to your terms.

728
01:35:18,035 --> 01:35:19,202
I'll kill you.

729
01:37:24,533 --> 01:37:26,783
♫ Jesse James we understand

730
01:37:26,867 --> 01:37:29,119
