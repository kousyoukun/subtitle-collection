But am I that important?

没有吧
I hardly think so.

你只是个生意人
- You're just a businessman. - Trying to make a living.

你想演“终结追杀令”吗？

73
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,592
是“绝命追杀令”
It's the O.K. Corral.

74
00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:58,267
你以为把我抓来他就会自首？
Do you think bringing me in will make him suddenly come to you?

75
00:07:58,474 --> 00:08:00,669
乖乖束手就擒？
Make him more agreeable?

76

别以为我从小没自来水喝
Don't think because I grew up without running water...

81

我来自德州
Well, I wouldn't know about that. I'm from Texas.

86
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:42,778
盖将军，你们不该来这儿
Mr. Garrison, I think you shouldn't have come here.

87
00:08:43,386 --> 00:08:45,286
这是内战
This is civil war.

88
00:08:46,255 --> 00:08:48,086
这是我们的战争
This is our war.

Not yours.

90

三十万人死亡
300,000 dead and counting.

91
00:08:54,831 --> 00:08:58,164
这不是战争，这是种族屠杀
That's not a war, Mr. Atto. That's genocide.

92
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:02,263
喝茶吧
Now, you enjoy that tea, you hear?

93

你觉得他怎样？
How'd he strike you?

94

彬彬有礼、冷酷无情
Urbane, sophisticated, cruel.

95

他是一条大鱼
Yeah, he's a good catch.

96

时间一久，艾迪德就会感到受制
It'll take time, but Aidid will feel the loss.

97
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,587
我们没有太多时间
I'm not sure time is something we got in great supply.

98
00:09:20,657 --> 00:09:24,821
这比伊拉克的情形更复杂
This isn't Iraq, you know. Much more complicated than that.

99
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:27,252
但华府官员可不这么想
Boss, most of Washington might disagree.

他们每天都要我们提出报告
They've been calling for situation reports every morning this week.

"Limo" is a word, Durant. I don't want to hear about it.

115
00:10:30,693 --> 00:10:33,355
那是缩写，不是一个字
<i>It is not a word.</i> <i>It's an abbreviation of a word.</i>

Secondly, I wouldn't know about the fighting, so don't ask.

为什么？
Why not?

137
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,852
我叫你别问我
Didn't I just say, "Don't ask"?

生日　　　1975年2月27日
- Date of birth. - 2-27-75.

143
00:12:00,449 --> 00:12:01,541
（18岁）

144
00:12:04,086 --> 00:12:05,951
我是来踢爆坏人的
Well, I'm here to kick some ass.

145
00:12:10,793 --> 00:12:12,226
回去吧
<i>Let's bring it in.</i>

146
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,673
漂亮，干得好
Nice, man! Very smooth!

147
00:12:30,112 --> 00:12:31,943
一枪就射穿引擎
Single shot through the engine block.

148
00:12:32,615 --> 00:12:35,311
真可惜，那辆吉普车很帅
Shit, that's a shame. That was a nice jeep.

149
00:12:59,075 --> 00:13:01,373
停火
Cease fire! Cease fire!

150
00:13:02,044 --> 00:13:03,068
检查武器
Check your weapons!

151
00:13:03,312 --> 00:13:04,301
艾中士
Sergeant Eversmann.

152
00:13:08,684 --> 00:13:10,151
我是一等兵贝克朋
Private First Class Blackburn.

153
00:13:10,486 --> 00:13:11,475
什么事？
Yeah?

154
00:13:12,088 --> 00:13:13,146
我来报到
Reporting for duty.

155
00:13:13,823 --> 00:13:15,457
你要向毕中尉报到
Not to me. You're reporting to It. Beales. He should be here somewhere.

156
00:13:15,623 --> 00:13:18,057
他应该就在附近

157
00:13:18,327 --> 00:13:19,453
我把他交给你
Can I leave him with you?

158
00:13:20,496 --> 00:13:22,487
好吧
Yeah, go ahead.

159
00:13:22,865 --> 00:13:24,765
你把枪带来了　　　是，长官
- You brought your weapon. - Yes, sir.

160
00:13:25,101 --> 00:13:26,898
我不累，我能练靶吗？
Want me to shoot? I'm rested.

161
00:13:27,236 --> 00:13:30,137
你几时到的？　　　刚才
- When did you get in? - Just now, Sergeant.

162
00:13:35,044 --> 00:13:36,170
谁饿了？
Hey, who's hungry?

163
00:13:58,701 --> 00:13:59,684
这算什么？
What is this, Sarg'nt? Another taxpayer-funded Delta safari?

164
00:13:59,831 --> 00:14:02,284
纳税人出钱的狩猎大餐？

165
00:14:02,305 --> 00:14:03,607
盖将军问起可别说
- Not if General Garrison is asking. - I'm asking.

166
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:05,297
我问起呢？

167
00:14:06,175 --> 00:14:07,699
用餐愉快，上尉
Have a nice meal, Captain.

168
00:14:12,548 --> 00:14:14,812
大家都在排队　　　我知道
- Hey, man, there's a line. - I know.

169
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:18,652
你这是插队　　　我也知道
- Well, this isn't the back of it. - Yeah, I know.

170
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:22,184
中士
Sergeant. Sergeant.

171
00:14:22,892 --> 00:14:24,086
这干嘛？
What's going on here?

172
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,186
我们在练靶，打到一只野猪
Some aerial target practice, sir. Didn't want to leave it behind.

173
00:14:27,263 --> 00:14:29,424
我是说你的步枪
I'm talking about your weapon.

174
00:14:29,532 --> 00:14:30,736
反恐怖部队也不能…
Delta or no Delta, that's a hot weapon.

175
00:14:30,862 --> 00:14:32,286
拿着上膛步枪到处晃
You know better than that. Safety should be on at all times on base.

176
00:14:32,301 --> 00:14:35,600
你应该很清楚，枪要随时上保险

177
00:14:35,671 --> 00:14:38,037
这就是我的“保险”
Well, this is my safety, sir.

178
00:14:40,843 --> 00:14:43,812
别管他，他两天没吃饭了
Let it go, sir. The guy hasn't eaten in a couple of days.

179
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:46,712
反恐怖部队都是一群蛮牛
You Delta boys are a bunch of undisciplined cowboys.

180
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,414
让我告诉你
Let me tell you something, Sarg'nt.

181
00:14:49,618 --> 00:14:53,384
到了前线你需要游骑兵支援
When we get on a five-yard line, you're going to need my Rangers.

182
00:14:53,456 --> 00:14:55,515
你最好有点团队精神
Y'all better learn to be team players.

183
00:14:57,293 --> 00:14:58,783
我说完了
We're done here.

184
00:15:08,404 --> 00:15:11,896
说呀，你说这是保险
Speak up. You say this is your safety?

185
00:15:12,074 --> 00:15:13,905
这是我的靴子
Well, this is my boot, son.

186
00:15:14,777 --> 00:15:18,178
小心我用这只靴子把你踢爆
And it will fit up your ass with the proper amount of force.

187
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:20,310
这算新泽西口音吗？
- Is that a Jersey accent? - I'm trying to do this, give me a break.

188
00:15:20,481 --> 00:15:22,010
拜托，我很努力

189
00:15:22,218 --> 00:15:24,083
把太阳眼镜脱掉
Take those sunglasses off.

190
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,552
反恐怖部队爱戴名牌墨镜我不管
Delta wants to wear Oakleys, that's their business.

191
00:15:26,622 --> 00:15:28,852
别让我再看到你戴
I don't want to see them on you again.

192
00:15:30,626 --> 00:15:32,321
那是一把上膛的步枪？
<i>Is that a hot weapon?</i>

193
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,031
你下了吗？
Is that your move?

194
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:41,066
手还没离棋啊？
Is my hand on the piece?

195
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,870
再下三步…我就赢了
I can mate you in three whatever you do.

196
00:15:45,341 --> 00:15:48,640
你自己最好小心点
I'd keep my eye on that queen before counseling others.

197
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:51,246
有种就放马过来
Well, she's just lying in wait.

198
00:15:55,151 --> 00:15:56,140
唉
Yikes.

199
00:15:58,387 --> 00:16:01,379
你画得越来越好了
It's good. You're really improving.

200
00:16:01,891 --> 00:16:04,485
不过我有一个建议
If I may make a suggestion... Observation.

201
00:16:04,693 --> 00:16:05,682
说吧
Go ahead.

202
00:16:05,928 --> 00:16:07,160
这是童话故事，对吧？
- It's a children's book, right? - Right.

203
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:08,260
没错

204
00:16:08,864 --> 00:16:12,994
这会把小孩子吓得屁滚尿流
They are not supposed to scare the living shit out of the children.

205
00:16:13,135 --> 00:16:16,901
骑士正要屠龙
This is the part of the story where our knight is slaying the dragon.

206
00:16:16,972 --> 00:16:18,034
本来就很可怕
That's scary. Besides, my daughter loves this stuff.

207
00:16:18,172 --> 00:16:19,634
而且我女儿最喜欢了

208
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,699
我以为你上礼拜就画完了
Thought you finished that last week.

209
00:16:22,344 --> 00:16:23,606
你说完了吗？
You done?

210
00:16:25,181 --> 00:16:28,673
就快冲到十码线了
Hey, we are at the 10-yard line here, men.

211
00:16:28,851 --> 00:16:30,341
明白吗？
You understand?

212
00:16:30,853 --> 00:16:33,344
你会数吗？1、2、3
Can you count? One, two, ten.

213
00:16:33,856 --> 00:16:36,017
我的后卫呢？
Okay? Where are my running backs?

214
00:16:36,225 --> 00:16:38,022
我的后卫呢？
Where are my running backs?

215
00:16:39,528 --> 00:16:42,656
我没看到你做礼拜
Hey, I didn't see you at church on Sunday.

216
00:16:42,865 --> 00:16:44,799
你有别的事吗？
You had something more important to do?

217
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,434
礼拜天一定要做礼拜
Not on Sunday, you don't. Not anymore.

218
00:16:47,503 --> 00:16:49,801
别给我落跑，了解吗？
I will make you believe, you understand?

219
00:17:05,054 --> 00:17:06,453
很好笑，呼呀
Pretty funny, hoo-ah?

220
00:17:09,492 --> 00:17:13,019
你学得很像，很像我
It was a good impression. I recognize myself.

221
00:17:15,498 --> 00:17:17,295
继续吧
All right, carry on.

222
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,833
我要跟你讲话　　　是，长官
- I'd like a word, specialist. - Sir.

223
00:17:21,504 --> 00:17:24,996
你知道谁有指挥权吧？
You understand why we have a chain of command, don't you?

224
00:17:25,174 --> 00:17:26,072
知道，长官
Roger that, sir.

225
00:17:26,142 --> 00:17:27,934
你敢再取笑我
If you ever undermine me again, you'll clean latrines with your tongue...

226
00:17:28,042 --> 00:17:29,934
我就命令你把马桶舔干净

227
00:17:30,112 --> 00:17:32,738
保证你一个月吃不下饭
...till you taste no difference between shit and French fries.

228
00:17:32,815 --> 00:17:33,941
明白吗？　　　明白，长官
- Are we clear? - Hoo-ah, sir.

229
00:17:34,016 --> 00:17:34,948
好吧
All right.

230
00:17:42,825 --> 00:17:43,849
听好：
Listen to this:

231
00:17:43,926 --> 00:17:45,893
当一个索马利亚人杀了人
If one skinny kills another his clan owes the dead guy's clan a hundred camels.

232
00:17:45,906 --> 00:17:48,993
他的部落就欠对方部落一百只骆驼

233
00:17:49,031 --> 00:17:50,225
一百只骆驼
A hundred camels.

234
00:17:50,466 --> 00:17:52,696
我连一只都不给
Camels. I wouldn't pay one camel.

235
00:17:53,202 --> 00:17:55,136
这儿的骆驼欠债一定很多
Must be a lot of fucking camel debt.

236
00:17:55,971 --> 00:17:57,836
这是真的吗？
Is that really true, Lieutenant?

237
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,065
去问艾士官，他喜欢非洲人
Ask Sgt. Eversmann. He likes skinnies.

238
00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:03,137
艾士官，那是真的吗？
Sgt. Eversmann, you really like the skinnies?

239
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:05,710
不是喜欢不喜欢的问题
It's not that I like them or I don't like them. I respect them.

240
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:07,310
我尊敬他们
See, what you guys fail to realize is the sergeant is a bit of an idealist.

241
00:18:07,483 --> 00:18:11,647
你们要知道艾士官很有理想

242
00:18:12,288 --> 00:18:14,289
他相信这项任务的使命
He believes in this mission down to his bones. Don't you, Sergeant?

243
00:18:14,438 --> 00:18:15,689
对吧，士官？
Look, these people, they have no jobs...

244
00:18:15,925 --> 00:18:19,190
这些人没有工作

245
00:18:19,428 --> 00:18:23,524
没有食物、教育和未来
...no food, no education, no future.

246
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:27,194
我只是觉得我们有两个选择
I just figure that, I mean, we have two things that we can do.

247
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:28,793
帮助他们
We can help...

248
00:18:28,871 --> 00:18:32,307
或是眼睁睁看着他们自相残杀
...or we can sit back and watch the country destroy itself on CNN.

249
00:18:32,374 --> 00:18:33,363
对吧？
Right?

250
00:18:33,709 --> 00:18:36,678
我不知道，我是来打仗的
I don't know about you guys, but I was trained to fight.

251
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:38,938
你不是吗？
Are you trained to fight, Sergeant?

252
00:18:39,014 --> 00:18:41,812
我是来改善世界的
Well, I think I was trained to make a difference, Kurth.

253
00:18:42,985 --> 00:18:45,351
他真的很有理想
Like the man said, he's an idealist.

254
00:18:47,122 --> 00:18:49,181
等等，我最爱这一段
Oh, wait. This is my favorite part.

255
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,595
滚远一点
<i>Stay away from the cans!</i>

256
00:18:56,832 --> 00:18:59,198
去死吧，猪头
<i>Die, gas-pumper!</i>

257
00:18:59,868 --> 00:19:01,665
给我滚远一点
<i>Stay away from those cans!</i>

258
00:19:06,575 --> 00:19:08,702
不，退后
No, no, stay back.

259
00:19:08,777 --> 00:19:10,209
他的癫痫症发作了
He's having a seizure. Put something in his mouth.

260
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,769
拿东西让他咬着
John, it's okay. John, it's okay. It's okay.

261
00:19:11,847 --> 00:19:16,784
约翰，没事了…没事了…

262
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:25,756
（清晨5点45分 - 10月3日，星期天）

263
00:20:03,165 --> 00:20:05,998
他没事了，不过他得退伍
Well, he'll be fine. But not in this army.

264
00:20:07,002 --> 00:20:09,664
他有癫痫症，我要送他回家
He's out of the game. He's epileptic, going home.

265
00:20:14,176 --> 00:20:16,804
我要你当小队长
I'm putting you in charge of his chalk.

266
00:20:17,246 --> 00:20:20,079
你有意见吗？　　　没有，长官
- You got a problem with that? - No, sir.

267
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:22,242
这个责任很重大
It's a big responsibility.

268
00:20:22,318 --> 00:20:24,878
你的弟兄都仰赖你
Your men will look to you to make the right decisions.

269
00:20:24,953 --> 00:20:27,012
他们的命都在你手上
Their lives depend on it.

270
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,318
好了
All right.

271
00:20:29,992 --> 00:20:32,961
游骑兵做先锋　　　勇往直前
- Rangers lead the way, sir. - All the way.

272
00:20:33,162 --> 00:20:34,595
祝好运
Good luck.

273
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:39,769
（哈瓦迪街 - 巴卡拉市集）

274
00:20:39,866 --> 00:20:42,369
（艾迪德民兵据点）

275
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,607
艾迪德的资深阁员
<i>A meeting of Aidid's senior cabinet</i> <i>may take place today at 1500 hours.</i>

276
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,607
今天下午三点可能要开会

277
00:21:23,746 --> 00:21:26,476
我说可能是因为…
I say "may" because we all know by now...

278
00:21:26,682 --> 00:21:29,947
根据目前的情报，一切都不确定
...with the intel we get on the street, nothing is certain.

279
00:21:30,152 --> 00:21:32,985
这是三方确定的情报
This is actual intel confirmed by three sources.

280
00:21:33,822 --> 00:21:36,882
两名高层阁员可能会在场
Two tier-one personalities may be present:

281
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:41,386
奥玛萨拉，艾迪德的政治顾问
Omar Salad, Aidid's top political advisor...

282
00:21:41,463 --> 00:21:44,057
哈珊奥威利，内政部长
...and Abdi Hassan Awale, interior minister.

283
00:21:44,133 --> 00:21:46,124
他们是我们的目标
These are the guys we're after.

284
00:21:47,002 --> 00:21:48,367
今天就行动
Today we go.

285
00:21:48,937 --> 00:21:51,428
任务计划和以前一样
Same mission template as before.

286
00:21:51,673 --> 00:21:53,769
3点45分，反恐攻击小组
1545, Assault Force Delta will infiltrate the target building...

287
00:21:53,873 --> 00:21:55,769
负责攻入敌方建筑物

288
00:21:55,978 --> 00:21:58,173
逮捕内部所有嫌疑犯
...and seize all suspects within.

289
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,282
史上尉指挥的游骑兵小队
Security Force Rangers: 4 Ranger chalks, under command of Capt. Steele...

290
00:22:02,351 --> 00:22:04,615
要在3点46分
...will rope in at 1546...

291
00:22:04,753 --> 00:22:08,120
在目标的四个角落建立防线
...and hold a four-corner perimeter around the target building.

292
00:22:08,657 --> 00:22:09,988
任何人不得进出
No one gets in or out.

293
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:11,783
撤退部队
Extraction Force:

294
00:22:12,094 --> 00:22:14,122
麦奈中校的悍马车队…
It. Colonel McKnight's humvee column will drive in at 1547...

295
00:22:14,294 --> 00:22:16,622
在3点47分开进哈瓦迪街

296
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:20,768
停在奥林匹克旅馆前
...on Hawlwadig Road and hold just short of the Olympic Hotel.

297
00:22:20,969 --> 00:22:22,436
等待指令
Wait for the green light.

298
00:22:22,638 --> 00:22:24,503
当反恐怖部队突击成功
Now once Delta gives the word...

299
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:29,439
麦中校的手下就把人犯架上车
...McKnight's column will go to the target and load the prisoners onto trucks.

300
00:22:30,012 --> 00:22:32,412
把人犯架上车后
Immediately after the prisoners are loaded...

301
00:22:32,581 --> 00:22:36,677
游骑兵队员立刻到目标大楼集合
...the four Ranger chalks will collapse back to the target building...

302
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:38,284
一起上悍马车队
...load up on humvees...

303
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:42,355
地面部队就一路赶回基地
...and the entire ground force will exfil the 3 miles back to base.

304
00:22:42,658 --> 00:22:45,889
行动时间只有半小时
Mission time, no longer than 30 minutes.

305
00:22:46,995 --> 00:22:49,630
现在，我请求调动装甲车…
Now, I had requested light armor and AC-130 Spectre gunships...

306
00:22:49,795 --> 00:22:51,830
和AC-130炮艇机支援

307
00:22:52,034 --> 00:22:56,095
但华府却不同意
...but Washington, in all its wisdom, decided against this.

308
00:22:56,305 --> 00:22:58,136
太显眼了
Too high-profile.

309
00:22:58,373 --> 00:23:01,536
准备多管机枪的黑鹰直升机
So Black Hawks and Little Birds will provide the air cover...

310
00:23:01,777 --> 00:23:03,972
将提供空中支援
...with miniguns and 2.75 rockets.

311
00:23:04,213 --> 00:23:05,578
哈上校
Colonel Harrell.

312
00:23:05,781 --> 00:23:10,115
马上校负责调派空中支援
In the C-2 bird, Colonel Matthews will coordinate the air mission...

313
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:13,452
我负责指挥地面部队
...and I will coordinate ground forces.

314
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:15,086
马上校
Colonel Matthews.

315
00:23:15,157 --> 00:23:18,456
任务执行代号是艾琳
Mission launch code word is Irene.

316
00:23:18,927 --> 00:23:19,916
有问题吗？
Questions?

317
00:23:23,165 --> 00:23:24,496
目标是哪栋建筑？
Which building is it, sir?

318
00:23:25,033 --> 00:23:28,628
巴卡拉市集附近的建筑物
We're confirming that now. Somewhere near the Bakara market.

319
00:23:31,273 --> 00:23:34,265
我不能决定他们在哪里开会
I don't choose the time or place of their meetings.

320
00:23:34,443 --> 00:23:36,240
我没这么说
I didn't say a word, sir.

321
00:23:36,545 --> 00:23:39,946
大家听好，你们到了市集
Make no mistake, once you're in the Bakara market...

322
00:23:40,015 --> 00:23:42,415
就等于进入敌区
...you're in an entirely hostile district.

323
00:23:42,951 --> 00:23:45,317
千万别低估敌人实力
Don't underestimate their capabilities.

324
00:23:45,554 --> 00:23:49,149
进入市集之前…都不是敌区
We'll be in friendly neighborhoods before we hit the market...

325
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:51,340
千万切记交战法则
...so remember the rules of engagement: No one fires unless fired upon.

326
00:23:51,491 --> 00:23:53,990
遭到攻击才能反击

327
00:23:54,162 --> 00:23:56,426
完成任务吧
Now, let's go get this thing done.

328
00:23:57,533 --> 00:23:59,160
祝好运，各位
Good luck, gentlemen.

329
00:24:04,106 --> 00:24:07,041
怎么了？你不满意吗？
What's the matter, Danny? Something you don't like?

330
00:24:07,242 --> 00:24:09,437
没有C - 炮艇机，白天出任务
No Spectre gunships, daylight instead of night...

331
00:24:09,611 --> 00:24:12,102
敌人的精神在下午特别亢奋
...afternoon when they're all fucked up on khat...

332
00:24:12,281 --> 00:24:16,445
那儿又是火力集中的敌区
...only part of the city Aidid can mount a counter-attack on short notice<i>...</i>

333
00:24:16,818 --> 00:24:18,219
我有什么不满意的？
- What's not to like? - Life's imperfect.

334
00:24:18,288 --> 00:24:19,719
人生十有八九不如意

335
00:24:19,922 --> 00:24:23,653
你们在半空中，只是不如意
For you two, circling above it at 500 feet, it's imperfect.

336
00:24:23,892 --> 00:24:27,555
我们在地面就苦不堪言
Down in the street, it's unforgiving.

337
00:25:03,732 --> 00:25:05,029
搞什么？
What the fuck, Smith?

338
00:25:06,001 --> 00:25:07,901
怎样？　　　什么怎样？
- Well? - Well, what?

339
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,537
我们要行动吗？
We going?

340
00:25:10,906 --> 00:25:14,672
我干嘛告诉你　　　你就是要说
- Why should I tell you that? - Because I'm me.

341
00:25:16,011 --> 00:25:19,708
对，下午三点，市中心
Yeah. 3:00. Downtown.

342
00:25:19,915 --> 00:25:21,439
巴卡拉市集　　　好
- Bakara market. - All right.

343
00:25:21,683 --> 00:25:25,517
小史，我要你全力支持我
Listen, Smith, I need you to back me up out there today, all right?

344
00:25:25,721 --> 00:25:26,915
提高警觉
Keep sharp.

345
00:25:29,591 --> 00:25:31,718
遵命，艾士官
Yes, sir, Sergeant Eversmann.

346
00:25:31,927 --> 00:25:34,293
这次行动是小意思啦
Ev, it's going to be nothing, man.

347
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,227
小意思
Nothing.

348
00:25:39,101 --> 00:25:41,337
关键是磨咖啡豆
It's all in the grind, Sizemore. Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.

349
00:25:41,501 --> 00:25:44,437
不能磨得太细或太粗

350
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,235
这是一种技巧
This, my friend, is a science.

351
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,943
我可是相信征兵广告的那种人
You're looking at the guy that believed the commercials.

352
00:25:51,146 --> 00:25:53,273
尽忠报国
About "be all you can be<i>."</i>

353
00:25:53,482 --> 00:25:56,280
但是我在波湾战争都在煮咖啡
I made coffee through Desert Storm.

354
00:25:56,585 --> 00:25:58,182
在巴拿马也煮咖啡
I made coffee through Panama, while everyone else got to fight...

355
00:25:58,335 --> 00:25:59,782
别的游骑兵队员…

356
00:25:59,988 --> 00:26:01,819
都出生入死
...got to be a Ranger.

357
00:26:02,524 --> 00:26:04,859
我却只能煮黑咖啡
Now it's "Grimesy, black, one sugar" or "Grimesy, got a powdered anywhere?"

358
00:26:05,024 --> 00:26:07,359
替别人拿奶精

359
00:26:11,233 --> 00:26:13,724
怎么了？　　　乒乓球受伤
- What happened to you? - Ping-Pong accident.

360
00:26:14,102 --> 00:26:15,091
什么？
What?

361
00:26:16,071 --> 00:26:17,436
猜怎么着？
So guess what.

362
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,838
你的愿望实现了，你要出任务
Your wish has been granted. You're going out today.

363
00:26:21,043 --> 00:26:22,670
少唬我
You're fucking me.

364
00:26:22,911 --> 00:26:25,379
你要代替我负责配备M-16步枪
You're taking my place assisting the 60 gunner.

365
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,743
艾士官叫你收拾好装备
Sergeant Eversmann said to get your stuff and get ready.

366
00:26:29,918 --> 00:26:31,886
你想要打仗，不是吗？
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

367
00:26:32,054 --> 00:26:33,385
是啊
Oh, yeah.

368
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,248
当然了
Hell, yeah.

369
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:40,121
葛姆，跟着瓦德给他弹药
Grimesy, stick with Waddell and give him ammo when he needs it.

370
00:26:40,195 --> 00:26:41,492
呼呀？　　　呼呀
- Hoo-ah? - Hoo-ah.

371
00:26:41,596 --> 00:26:46,090
别担心，索利亚人的枪法都很烂
I wouldn't worry about that. Generally speaking, Somalis can't shoot for shit.

372
00:26:46,301 --> 00:26:50,237
小心别被他们的石头打到就行
Just watch out for the sammys throwing the rocks, and you'll be fine.

373
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:51,565
会好玩的
Might even be fun.

374
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,502
让反恐部队打头阵
D-boys do their thing now. All we got to do is cover them.

375
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,542
我们只要支援他们

376
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:58,511
直升机也会掩护我们
Choppers going to cover us, and we'll be all right.

377
00:26:59,381 --> 00:27:03,249
我知道我是第一次当小队长
Look, you guys, this is my first time as chalk leader...

378
00:27:03,485 --> 00:27:06,886
但我们不是第一次出任务
...but, this isn't our first time out together. This is serious.

379
00:27:07,055 --> 00:27:10,491
我们是游骑兵，不是预备军官
We're Rangers, not some sorry-ass JROTC.

380
00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:12,321
我们是精英部队
We're elite.

381
00:27:13,028 --> 00:27:15,155
大家要好好表现
Let's act like it out there. Hoo-ah?

382
00:27:16,298 --> 00:27:17,993
有问题吗？
Any questions?

383
00:27:24,406 --> 00:27:26,067
我们不会有事的
We're going to be okay.

384
00:27:26,908 --> 00:27:28,739
收拾好装备，出动吧
Grab your gear. Let's move out.

385
00:27:49,097 --> 00:27:53,090
你不需要水壶，很快就会回来
You're not going to need that, dude. We're not out there long enough.

386
00:28:01,076 --> 00:28:02,475
那也用不着
You won't need that, either.

387
00:28:03,011 --> 00:28:04,911
天黑前就会回来
We'll be back before dark.

388
00:28:05,147 --> 00:28:07,707
你不如多带大麻和啤酒
You might as well take dope and beer instead.

389
00:28:07,883 --> 00:28:09,180
什么？
What?

390
00:28:09,384 --> 00:28:11,318
弹药啦，多带弹药啦
Ammo, dude. Take ammo.

391
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:22,227
你身上有五十磅的装备
Let me tell you something, Grimes. You got 50 pounds of gear.

392
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,522
不必多加十二磅
You don't need another 12.

393
00:28:23,665 --> 00:28:28,102
背这么重想逃命都逃不了
I don't know about you, I don't plan on getting shot running away.

394
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,694
我还是要穿防弹背心
Well, I better keep mine in.

395
00:28:29,905 --> 00:28:30,769
葛姆
Grimes.

396
00:28:31,006 --> 00:28:33,031
最重要的是
Most important thing:

397
00:28:33,175 --> 00:28:36,440
跟着大家射击的方向开枪
Remember, when everyone is shooting, shoot in the same direction.

398
00:28:44,719 --> 00:28:48,416
你看，他在靴子贴上血型
Look at this. He's taping his blood type to his boots.

399
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:52,117
触霉头　　　很聪明
- That's bad luck. - No, it's smart.

400
00:28:52,427 --> 00:28:54,224
反恐怖部队都这么做
All Delta do that.

401
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,021
写遗书也很倒霉
That's bad luck too, man.

402
00:28:57,532 --> 00:28:58,658
快走吧
Come on, let's go.

403
00:29:02,237 --> 00:29:05,070
幸好你不是左撇子
It's a good thing you're right-handed, Adonis.

404
00:29:07,209 --> 00:29:09,407
要不然你就没搞头了
- If not, I don't know what you'd do. - You're a funny guy, man.

405
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:11,407
你真会说笑

406
00:29:13,048 --> 00:29:14,346
我不替你拿遗书
- I'm not taking no death letter. - We have a deal.

407
00:29:14,468 --> 00:29:15,846
我们说好的

408
00:29:18,653 --> 00:29:20,644
一小时后还给你
I'll give it to you back in an hour.

409
00:29:20,889 --> 00:29:23,787
贝克朋，你还好吧？
- Blackburn, you okay? - Excited.

410
00:29:23,939 --> 00:29:25,387
我很兴奋

411
00:29:26,561 --> 00:29:30,053
这是好事我当兵就是为了打仗
In a good way. I've been training my whole life for this.

412
00:29:30,432 --> 00:29:32,457
你杀过人吗？
You ever shot at anybody before?

413
00:29:33,034 --> 00:29:34,023
没有
No, sir.

414
00:29:35,637 --> 00:29:36,865
我也没有
Me neither.

415
00:29:40,108 --> 00:29:42,975
（下午2点29分）

416
00:30:11,106 --> 00:30:12,573
他可靠吗？
Think he's reliable?

417
00:30:12,641 --> 00:30:16,168
等着瞧吧，他第一次出任务
Well, we'll see. It's his first time out.

418
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:18,310
（联合行动指挥中心）

419
00:30:24,252 --> 00:30:25,820
叫他把收音机关掉
- Tell him to turn his damn radio off. - Yes, sir.

420
00:30:25,952 --> 00:30:26,620
是，长官
Tell him to turn his radio off.

421
00:30:26,788 --> 00:30:28,619
叫他把收音机关掉

422
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:31,682
阿弟，把收音机关掉
Abdi, you need to turn your radio off.

423
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:40,043
嗨，这是史黛芬和蓝迪
<i>Hi. You've reached Stephanie and Randy,</i> <i>leave us a message. Thank you.</i>

424
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:42,663
请留言，谢谢

425
00:30:45,006 --> 00:30:47,440
老婆，是我，你在吗？
<i>Hey, baby, it's me. Are you there?</i>

426
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:51,001
你在的话就快接
<i>Pick up if you're there.</i>

427
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,849
我只是打来看你好不好
I'm just calling to make sure everything's all right.

428
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:57,884
过两小时再打给你
I'll call you in a couple hours.

429
00:30:58,954 --> 00:31:00,854
你最好别睡着了
You'd better not be sleeping.

430
00:31:01,856 --> 00:31:03,153
该你了，蓝迪
Your move, Randy.

431
00:31:04,893 --> 00:31:06,417
我好想你
<i>I'm missing you.</i>

432
00:31:07,462 --> 00:31:09,225
我爱你
I love you, baby.

433
00:31:10,665 --> 00:31:11,996
喂？
Hello? Hello?

434
00:31:14,235 --> 00:31:15,463
谢了
Thanks, bud.

435
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:19,739
这有点好笑
You know, it's kind of funny.

436
00:31:20,342 --> 00:31:23,470
洁白的沙滩，灿烂的阳光
Beautiful beach, beautiful sun.

437
00:31:24,813 --> 00:31:27,111
几乎是一个好地方
Could almost be a good place to visit.

438
00:31:27,248 --> 00:31:28,647
几乎
Almost.

439
00:31:32,253 --> 00:31:34,380
你认为我们不该来
You don't think we should be here.

440
00:31:35,323 --> 00:31:37,783
你知道我怎么想吗？
You know what I think? It don't really matter what I think.

441
00:31:37,923 --> 00:31:39,783
我怎么想不重要

442
00:31:41,129 --> 00:31:45,498
第一颗子弹从你头上呼啸而过
Once that first bullet goes past your head, politics and all that shit...

443
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:47,794
那些狗屁倒灶的事都不重要
...just goes right out the window.

444
00:31:48,436 --> 00:31:50,597
我只想完成任务
I just want to do it right today.

445
00:31:51,239 --> 00:31:55,073
打起精神，让弟兄活着回来
Just watch your corner. Get all your men back here alive.

446
00:32:20,301 --> 00:32:24,135
就是这里还是汽车抛锚？
Now, is this supposed to be the place, or did his car just take a dump?

447
00:32:24,339 --> 00:32:25,772
阿弟，请回答
<i>Abdi, come in.</i>

448
00:32:26,274 --> 00:32:28,742
你听到吗？这是目标吗？
Abdi, can you hear me? Is this the place?

449
00:32:33,081 --> 00:32:34,275
阿弟
<i>Abdi, come in.</i>

450
00:32:39,587 --> 00:32:42,181
听到吗？
<i>Can you hear me? Abdi.</i>

451
00:32:42,957 --> 00:32:45,949
请回答，是这里吗？
<i>Abdi, come in. Is this the place?</i>

452
00:32:46,161 --> 00:32:48,629
我右手边，咖啡厅楼上
To my right side, above the cafe.

453
00:32:48,997 --> 00:32:51,261
他说就是这里
<i>He says this is the building.</i>

454
00:32:51,499 --> 00:32:52,932
他确定？
He's certain?

455
00:32:53,535 --> 00:32:55,366
阿弟，你要确定才行
<i>Abdi, you need to be sure.</i>

456
00:32:55,603 --> 00:32:56,968
你确定？
Are you sure?

457
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,974
目标在我左边两条街口外
Well, it's down the road, two blocks over on my left.

458
00:33:03,912 --> 00:33:05,812
不过民兵太多了
But there's too many militia.

459
00:33:06,381 --> 00:33:08,713
我一靠近…他们就会开枪
<i>If I go closer, they might shoot me.</i>

460
00:33:09,084 --> 00:33:12,212
他说目标在两个街口外
<i>Now he's saying the building's</i> <i>a couple blocks down...</i>

461
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,786
不过他怕…对方会向他开枪
...but if he's seen outside it, he'll be shot.

462
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,751
我才会宰了他
I'll fucking shoot him myself.

463
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:21,486
叫他把车子停在目标门口
Tell him I want his skinny ass parked in front of the building.

464
00:33:21,563 --> 00:33:24,726
他不去就拿不到钱
He's not getting paid till he does exactly that.

465
00:33:24,933 --> 00:33:28,130
离目标三哩，不要走小路
Three miles to the target. We're never off the main roads.

466
00:33:28,203 --> 00:33:31,400
到了圆环先向北然后往东
At K-four traffic circle, we turn north, then east on National...

467
00:33:31,473 --> 00:33:34,670
在那儿等候劫出人犯
...and we wait until extraction of prisoners is complete here.

468
00:33:34,742 --> 00:33:36,710
然后全队开进
Then we roll up in force on Hawlwadig...

469
00:33:36,778 --> 00:33:40,305
把人犯跟地面部队载回来
...load the prisoners, the assault-blocking forces and bring them back.

470
00:33:41,049 --> 00:33:43,210
一小时后回基地
Home in an hour. Okay?

471
00:33:43,418 --> 00:33:44,607
敌人会反击
There will be some shooting. Bakara market is the Wild West.

472
00:33:44,758 --> 00:33:46,717
那儿就像西部电影一样

473
00:33:46,788 --> 00:33:50,053
小心开枪，那儿有平民
But be careful what you shoot at. People do live there.

474
00:33:50,658 --> 00:33:51,920
呼呀
Hoo-ah.

475
00:34:03,872 --> 00:34:08,070
上一个线民玩俄罗斯轮盘死了
Last one of these guys shot himself in the head playing Russian roulette.

476
00:34:21,756 --> 00:34:24,054
长官，他停车了
<i>Sir, the vehicle is stopped.</i>

477
00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:28,260
这就是目标，他确定吗？
So this is the real deal now. He's sure this time.

478
00:34:29,264 --> 00:34:31,360
他吓得屁滚尿流
<i>- He sounds scared shitless.</i> - Good. That's always a good sign.

479
00:34:31,564 --> 00:34:33,360
好，好现象

480
00:34:44,779 --> 00:34:46,940
这就是我们的信号
<i>That's it. That's our signal.</i>

481
00:34:47,115 --> 00:34:48,446
好
All right.

482
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,714
要所有飞机离开该空域

487
00:35:17,078 --> 00:35:18,272

00:35:45,173 --> 00:35:46,606
小心点
Be careful.

493
00:35:47,008 --> 00:35:49,101
决不抛弃同胞
No one gets left behind.

494
00:35:51,012 --> 00:35:52,343
怎么了？
What's wrong?

495
00:35:53,181 --> 00:35:56,344
他从没来道过别
Nothing. He's just never done that before.

496
00:35:57,352 --> 00:35:58,819
天杀的
Aw, fuck!

497

00:53:59,533 --> 00:54:01,626
你收到吗？
25, do you read me? Over.

692
00:54:02,302 --> 00:54:04,634
杰利顿、史密斯
Galentine! Schmid!

693
00:54:04,805 --> 00:54:05,897
去找尤利
Get Yurek.

694
00:54:06,139 --> 00:54:07,401
和汤比
Get Twombly.

695
00:54:07,674 --> 00:54:09,972
有一架黑鹰直升机坠毁
Hey, there's a Black Hawk down.

696
00:54:10,143 --> 00:54:11,940
汤比和尼森留守
Twombly, Nelson, stay here.

697
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:14,980
留在这儿，跟悍马车队撤退
Hold this corner and then exfil with the humvees.

698
00:54:15,182 --> 00:54:19,016
杰利顿、史医官，跟我来，走吧
Galentine, Schmid, you're coming with me. Let's go.

699
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:21,612
你为什么要我留守？
How come I got to stay back here?

700
00:54:21,755 --> 00:54:23,484
因为你很可靠
Because you're dependable.

701
00:54:24,658 --> 00:54:25,920
好了
All right...

702
00:54:27,627 --> 00:54:28,958
出发
...let's go!

703
00:54:34,201 --> 00:54:36,101
我最恨自己很可靠
I hate being dependable, man.

704
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:54,077
你的西边有敌人接近
<i>Juliet 25, hostiles advancing,</i> <i>parallel west to your position.</i>

705
00:54:54,187 --> 00:54:56,451
其中有妇女小孩
<i>Women and children among them. Over.</i>

706
00:54:56,556 --> 00:54:57,784
靠着墙走
Hit the wall.

707
00:55:13,907 --> 00:55:15,807
小心
Incoming!

708
00:55:21,481 --> 00:55:22,914
手榴弹

快走
Go.

710
00:55:50,911 --> 00:55:53,038
里头还有弟兄
We still got guys inside!

711
00:55:53,246 --> 00:55:54,838
我要去坠机地点
I'll go to the crash.

712
00:55:55,048 --> 00:55:58,848
你带队，我继续装载人犯
You take the rest of the team. I'll finish loading the prisoners.

713
00:55:59,019 --> 00:56:01,351
不，我们要一起去坠机地点
No! We'll go to the crash site together.

714
00:56:01,421 --> 00:56:03,651
守住防线，等待悍马车队
Secure the perimeter, wait for the humvees.

715
00:56:03,723 --> 00:56:05,554
收到　　　跟着我

716
00:56:06,126 --> 00:56:08,219
中士，听到吗？
Sarg'nt, are you receiving me?

717
00:56:08,295 --> 00:56:10,957
听到了，我们马上走
Yeah, I heard you. We should be leaving soon.

718
00:56:12,833 --> 00:56:15,631
好了，我们要撤退
All right, we need to move out now!

719
00:56:15,702 --> 00:56:18,933
人犯都上了车我就去接你们
I'll finish loading the prisoners and pick you up at the crash site!

720
00:56:19,005 --> 00:56:20,233
出发吧
Let's move out!

721
00:56:20,307 --> 00:56:21,706
出发了，快走
Moving out! Go!

722
00:56:28,849 --> 00:56:30,817
快上车
Get in! Get in!

723
00:56:31,017 --> 00:56:32,279
快点
Move!

724
00:56:45,732 --> 00:56:47,256
八点钟方向
Eight o'clock!

725
00:57:01,248 --> 00:57:03,546
葛姆，别靠着墙
Grimes, stay away from the walls.

726
00:57:18,465 --> 00:57:20,797
你没事吧？
Grimes. You okay?

727
00:57:21,134 --> 00:57:22,396
没事
Yeah!

728
00:57:24,471 --> 00:57:25,836
走吧，梅道
Let's go, Maddox.

729
00:57:26,306 --> 00:57:28,638
指挥部，车队出发了　　　收到
- C-2, convoy's moving out. <i>- Roger that.</i>

730
00:57:28,808 --> 00:57:31,436
麦道，看看这些猪头
Maddox, look at these jerks! These idiots!

731
00:57:31,678 --> 00:57:34,238
开快点，右转
Go, go! Right, Maddox, right!

732
00:57:43,823 --> 00:57:46,314
汤比，车队走了
Twombly, the convoy is leaving!

733
00:57:46,693 --> 00:57:48,490
嘿，汤比
Hey, Twombly!

734
00:57:49,329 --> 00:57:50,318
什么？
What?

735
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:53,021
他们忘了我们　　　什么？
- I think they've forgotten us. - What?

736
00:57:53,233 --> 00:57:54,723
算了
It doesn't matter.

737
00:58:02,442 --> 00:58:05,009
敌人从四面八方赶过去
<i>63 confirm. Skinnies are moving in</i> <i>on all sides. They need help now.</i>

738
00:58:05,142 --> 00:58:07,209
要赶快支援他们

739
00:58:08,515 --> 00:58:12,281
索马利亚人往坠机地点前进
<i>Indigenous personnel</i> <i>advancing to Wolcott crash site.</i>

740
00:58:13,687 --> 00:58:14,949
请重复
Say again. Over.

741
00:58:15,021 --> 00:58:17,319
一大堆人蜂拥而上
<i>A lot of people closing in.</i>

742
00:58:19,626 --> 00:58:22,220
第四队离那儿有多远？
How far is Chalk Four from the crash site?

743
00:58:22,462 --> 00:58:25,556
六个街口　　　他们要快一点
<i>- Six blocks, sir.</i> - They need to haul ass.

744
00:59:19,319 --> 00:59:21,287
趴下来
Get down! Get down!

745
00:59:22,389 --> 00:59:24,084
史考帝，你没事吧？
Scotty, are you okay?

746
00:59:26,126 --> 00:59:27,593
别回去
No, don't go back!

747
00:59:37,337 --> 00:59:39,362
趴下来
Get down! Get down!

748
00:59:41,775 --> 00:59:43,072
武装车
Technicals!

749
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:44,900
看到了
Got them!

750
00:59:52,118 --> 00:59:53,915
六点钟方向，快走
Six o'clock! Move, move!

751
01:00:15,942 --> 01:00:17,933
快…快…
Go, go, go!

752
01:00:23,516 --> 01:00:24,710
快走
Go, go!

753
01:00:28,054 --> 01:00:29,521
快点
Come on!

754
01:00:38,031 --> 01:00:39,726
尤利，走吧
Yurek, leaving!

755
01:00:42,702 --> 01:00:43,862
快点
Come on!

756
01:02:11,324 --> 01:02:14,953
部队，左转
<i>Uniform 64, left turn. Left turn.</i>

757
01:02:15,495 --> 01:02:19,522
你要告诉我在哪条街左转
Romeo 64, I need to know before I get to the goddamn street!

758
01:02:19,732 --> 01:02:22,326
先停一下，情报有延误
You have to slow down. There's a delay.

759
01:02:22,535 --> 01:02:25,031
侦察队要先向指挥中心报告
From the time directions are relayed from surveillance to JOC, then to me.

760
01:02:25,185 --> 01:02:27,131
然后再向我下令

761
01:02:27,407 --> 01:02:30,240
不能停，我们受到猛烈攻击
We can't slow down! We're taking heavy enemy fire!

762
01:02:30,376 --> 01:02:32,105
我们不能停下来
We can't slow down!

763
01:02:32,178 --> 01:02:36,046
我正收到侦察机的情报
<i>Danny, I'm getting information</i> <i>from Orion surveillance above.</i>

764
01:02:36,249 --> 01:02:38,979
快告诉我该怎么到坠机地点
<i>So get me my fucking directions to</i> <i>the crash site!</i>

765
01:02:39,052 --> 01:02:43,079
等一下，我看不到你的位置
<i>Danny, hold on. I no longer have</i> <i>the best view of your route.</i>

766
01:02:43,356 --> 01:02:45,847
快到正确位置呀
<i>Get your ass in the right place,</i> <i>goddamn it!</i>

767
01:02:46,025 --> 01:02:49,324
史崔克的车队情况如何？
What in the hell is the status of Struecker's humvees?

768
01:02:49,429 --> 01:02:52,364
车队几时会回到基地？
Colonel Harrell, ETA to base, Struecker's column.

769
01:02:52,532 --> 01:02:55,194
就快到了
<i>ETA to base momentarily.</i>

770
01:03:01,841 --> 01:03:03,274
开门
<i>Open the gate!</i>

771
01:03:25,431 --> 01:03:28,025
把他抬下车　　　来
- Get him out! Let's go! Let's go! - Come on.

772
01:03:30,703 --> 01:03:32,136
小心头
Watch his head.

773
01:03:32,205 --> 01:03:33,570
小心
Easy.

774
01:03:41,481 --> 01:03:44,245
贝克朋，你听到吗？找军医来
- Blackburn, can you hear me? - Get him to a medic.

775
01:04:18,751 --> 01:04:22,278
我们在坠机地点抢救伤者
<i>Star 41 is at the crash site</i> <i>to evacuate the injured. Over.</i>

776
01:04:22,555 --> 01:04:23,647
收到
<i>Roger that.</i>

777
01:05:02,695 --> 01:05:04,060
我帮你
I got you.

778
01:05:04,630 --> 01:05:05,824
小心
Easy.

779
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:14,904
杰利顿，你没事吧？
Galentine, you all right?

780
01:05:15,041 --> 01:05:18,807
杰利顿、寇斯，跟我来
Galentine, Kurth, with me! Cover fire, now.

781
01:05:18,878 --> 01:05:20,505
掩护他们
Full cover!

782
01:05:34,994 --> 01:05:36,325
有几个人？
How many are in there?

783
01:05:36,395 --> 01:05:39,159
两名驾驶阵亡，两名人员受伤
Two pilots are dead, two crew chiefs are wounded!

784
01:05:39,365 --> 01:05:41,557
他伤得很重，要把他救出来
- He's hurt bad. We must get out of here. - All right. Go ahead.

785
01:05:41,665 --> 01:05:42,857
好，去吧

786
01:06:15,101 --> 01:06:19,198
这是第四小队，你在开枪吗？
26, this is 25. Is that you shooting up the technicals?

787
01:06:19,872 --> 01:06:21,464
没错
This is 26. Roger that.

788
01:06:21,741 --> 01:06:25,637
狄马索，到东南边建立防线
DiTomasso, take the southeast corner. We're setting up a perimeter. Over.

789
01:06:25,878 --> 01:06:28,540
收到，马上赶过去
This is 26. Roger that. Moving there now.

790
01:06:28,748 --> 01:06:30,045
出发
Move out!

791
01:06:32,785 --> 01:06:35,185
史上尉，请回答
Captain Steele, come in.

792
01:06:36,889 --> 01:06:38,754
请说
Go ahead, 25. This is 64.

793
01:06:39,125 --> 01:06:40,605
有两名伤者…
We got two wounded and we got both the pilots dead in the chopper!

794
01:06:40,755 --> 01:06:43,755
两名直升机驾驶都阵亡了

795
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:45,722
请立刻派人接送伤兵
We need a medivac now!

796
01:06:46,199 --> 01:06:49,135
救援直升机没办法降落
It's too hot to land a bird. You must secure the perimeter first. Over.

797
01:06:49,299 --> 01:06:51,535
你要先建立防线

798
01:06:52,138 --> 01:06:53,332
悍马车队呢？
Where are the humvees?

799
01:06:53,406 --> 01:06:56,375
车队一定会到
<i>Be advised, 25, the convoy will be there.</i>

800
01:06:56,442 --> 01:06:59,570
他们遭到猛烈攻击
They're encountering a lot of resistance. 64 out.

801
01:07:11,358 --> 01:07:13,005
快架起机关枪
- Get the 50 up! <i>- You should see the crash directly ahead.</i>

802
01:07:13,158 --> 01:07:15,055
坠机地点就在前面

803
01:07:15,461 --> 01:07:17,929
前面只有路障
All I see is a roadblock!

804
01:07:19,065 --> 01:07:21,499
我会再找另一条路
I'll have to figure out another way.

805
01:07:46,993 --> 01:07:50,190
建立防线，把伤兵运走
Give me a defensive perimeter so we can load the wounded.

806
01:08:10,349 --> 01:08:12,044
快开枪呀
Fire your weapon, Othic!

807
01:08:24,097 --> 01:08:27,260
跟我女儿说，叫她安心
Tell my girls I'll be okay.

808
01:08:36,609 --> 01:08:38,167
医官
Medic!

809
01:08:38,945 --> 01:08:40,105
呼呀！
Hoo-ah!

810
01:09:08,908 --> 01:09:10,899
医官…
Medic! Medic!

811
01:09:11,511 --> 01:09:15,607
乔斯，帮我把他抬起来
Joyce! Joyce! Come on, help me pick him up!

812
01:09:17,083 --> 01:09:18,817
快帮我们逃走
<i>Get us off this fucking street!</i> <i>Where's the crash site? Say again.</i>

813
01:09:18,983 --> 01:09:21,417
坠机地点到底在哪？

814
01:09:21,587 --> 01:09:24,750
直走两百米
Keep going straight 200 meters.

815
01:09:24,957 --> 01:09:26,083
收到
<i>Roger that.</i>

816
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:28,957
走吧
Let's go!

817
01:09:29,495 --> 01:09:31,486
快走吧
Let's go, goddamn it, let's go!

818
01:09:49,782 --> 01:09:52,307
汤比，过来
Hey, Twombles. Come here.

819
01:09:56,522 --> 01:09:58,820
车队不会回来了
The humvees ain't coming back, dude.

820
01:09:59,458 --> 01:10:00,550
什么？
What?

821
01:10:01,961 --> 01:10:03,861
我们要去找他们吗？
Were we supposed to go to them?

822
01:10:03,930 --> 01:10:06,023
我以为他们要来找我们
I thought they were coming to us.

823
01:10:08,301 --> 01:10:10,826
我们应该去找他们　　　该死
- I think we're supposed to go to them. - Shit.

824
01:10:14,173 --> 01:10:15,731
我们赶去坠机地点
Let's go to the crash site.

825
01:10:15,808 --> 01:10:16,797
好吧
Okay.

826
01:10:16,976 --> 01:10:20,412
别在我耳边开枪，我听不到了
Don't fire that thing so close to my head. I can barely hear as it is.

827
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:21,468
出发
Move out.

828
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,187
可恶，趴下来
Shit! Get down!

829
01:10:38,331 --> 01:10:41,823
我警告过你，别这么近
What did I just tell you? If you do that again...

830
01:10:46,172 --> 01:10:48,197
尼森，你没事吧？
You okay? Nelson.

831
01:10:48,841 --> 01:10:51,173
你没事吧？
You all right?

832
01:10:51,711 --> 01:10:54,839
搜救直升机在现场进行救援
<i>Search and rescue bird on station</i> <i>inserting medics.</i>

833
01:11:06,659 --> 01:11:07,648
快走
Go!

834
01:11:12,131 --> 01:11:13,621
快，快
Go, go!

835
01:11:16,002 --> 01:11:19,460
C-2，这是68号，我被击中了
Son of a bitch. C-2, this is 68. We've been hit.

836
01:11:19,639 --> 01:11:22,972
超级68号，你的螺旋翼冒烟
Super 68, there is smoke coming from the top of your rotor.

837
01:11:23,175 --> 01:11:25,302
建议你立刻返航　　　收到
- Advise you to come out now. - Roger.

838
01:11:25,811 --> 01:11:27,210
最后一个人员
<i>Dropping last man.</i>

839
01:11:29,815 --> 01:11:32,747
我看到正前方有敌人拿着火箭筒
Art, I've got skinnies with RPGs at 12:00. Can you see them?

840
01:11:32,895 --> 01:11:34,047
你看到吗？
Got them. Give me 90 degrees left.

841
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,481
看到了，向左转九十度

842
01:11:46,565 --> 01:11:47,827
我要回去了
68 coming out.

843
01:11:49,835 --> 01:11:52,201
超级68号要回基地
<i>Super 68 is out. Over.</i>

844
01:12:02,114 --> 01:12:04,674
魏肯，情况如何？
Hey, Wilkie, what's the situation in there?

845
01:12:04,950 --> 01:12:06,781
两名驾驶都死了
Both pilots are dead.

846
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:10,714
我们不能移动他们
25, we can't move these guys, Matty.

847
01:12:10,890 --> 01:12:12,721
他们会没命的
We'll kill them just carrying them.

848
01:12:12,792 --> 01:12:15,192
就在这儿医治　　　收到
- Stabilize in here? - Roger.

849
01:12:15,561 --> 01:12:18,689
我们要在这儿进行医治
Stabilize in the bird. Repeat: Stabilize in here. Over.

850
01:12:18,798 --> 01:12:20,891
收到，我们掩护你们
Understood, Wilkie. We got you covered. Over.

851
01:12:20,966 --> 01:12:24,458
超级64号，去替代超级61号
Super 64, come inbound and take Wolcott's position.

852
01:12:25,404 --> 01:12:27,736
收到，开进中
Roger. 64 is inbound.

853
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:56,492
超级64号，你没事吧？
<i>Super 64, you all right?</i>

854
01:12:56,569 --> 01:12:59,367
这是超级64号，我没事
<i>This is Super 64. We're good.</i>

855
01:12:59,572 --> 01:13:02,439
确定吗？你的机身受损
You sure? You look like you got clipped pretty good.

856
01:13:02,641 --> 01:13:04,632
仪表板一切正常
Instrument panels are okay.

857
01:13:04,944 --> 01:13:06,078
我们没事
No, we're good. Got a slight vibration in the pedals, but we're good.

858
01:13:06,224 --> 01:13:08,778
机身有点晃动，不过没事

859
01:13:09,615 --> 01:13:13,984
降落后进行检查以策安全
All right, put her down on the airfield, 64. Have it checked out just to be safe.

860
01:13:14,453 --> 01:13:15,442
收到
<i>Roger.</i>

861
01:13:18,124 --> 01:13:22,288
机身晃动得很厉害，再检查系统
I'm getting movement in these pedals. Check the systems again.

862
01:13:37,476 --> 01:13:39,967
尾部螺旋翼失效
We lost the tail rotor! It's gone!

863
01:13:40,146 --> 01:13:41,841
64号要坠机
<i>64 is going down!</i>

864
01:13:42,982 --> 01:13:44,506
64要坠机了
<i>64 is going in hard.</i>

865
01:13:46,352 --> 01:13:48,081
我要坠机
64 going down.

866
01:13:52,992 --> 01:13:54,857
我们要坠机了
<i>We're going down.</i>

867
01:13:59,832 --> 01:14:01,732
快派史崔克的车队回去
Get Struecker's column back out there.

868
01:14:01,801 --> 01:14:04,099
叫他们赶到杜伦的坠机地点
They need to get to Durant's crash site fast.

869
01:14:04,170 --> 01:14:05,508
有另一架直升机坠毁
<i>- Another bird down.</i> - I want them out of there.

870
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:06,798
快去救他们

871
01:14:07,506 --> 01:14:08,473
全都救出来
All of them.

872
01:14:12,812 --> 01:14:15,940
史上尉，再不前进就会受困
Captain Steele, we got to move or we'll get pinned down!

873
01:14:16,215 --> 01:14:18,206
我们正在尽快前进
We're moving as fast as we can.

874
01:14:18,317 --> 01:14:21,480
你别管我的部队
You let me do my job and you do yours. Over.

875
01:14:29,229 --> 01:14:32,320
上帝…　　　路兹，趴下来
- Fuck! Fuck! - Ruiz stay down.

876
01:14:32,478 --> 01:14:33,758
我就知道　　　医官
- I fucking knew... - Medic.

877
01:14:33,903 --> 01:14:34,799
去他的！
Fuck this! Captain Steele, I'll take out the threat in the window.

878
01:14:35,343 --> 01:14:37,699
史上尉，我来对付狙击手

879
01:14:37,970 --> 01:14:40,234
我们到灰色大楼集合
We'll rally at the gray building. Coming through.

880
01:14:40,306 --> 01:14:40,829
中士
Sarg'nt!

881
01:14:41,073 --> 01:14:42,233
好，走吧
All right, let's move!

882
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,377
掩护我
Cover me!

883
01:14:55,221 --> 01:14:57,883
快走吧　　　快走
- Let's go, let's move! - Moving out.

884
01:15:03,596 --> 01:15:04,119
友军
Friendly!

885
01:15:04,196 --> 01:15:05,925
我是友军
Friendlies coming through!

886
01:15:05,998 --> 01:15:08,364
走吧，快走
Let's go, let's go! Move up!

887
01:15:08,601 --> 01:15:10,501
快…
Come on, come on!

888
01:15:11,003 --> 01:15:12,027
快…
Come on!

889
01:15:19,712 --> 01:15:21,407
快走…快…
Move up! Go! Move up!

890
01:15:21,814 --> 01:15:23,543
你在干什么？
What the fuck are you doing out there?

891
01:15:23,616 --> 01:15:26,312
我们要赶到坠机地点
Doing my job! We got to get to that crash site!

892
01:15:26,652 --> 01:15:29,450
我们一定要赶到那条街
We got to get on that street, and we got to move!

893
01:15:29,889 --> 01:15:31,982
你也要跟上来
And you have got to keep up, sir!

894
01:15:32,157 --> 01:15:34,318
别对我下令，中士
Don't you ever give me orders, Sergeant.

895
01:15:34,393 --> 01:15:36,861
我们没办法迎敌
We are combat ineffective, understand?

896
01:15:37,463 --> 01:15:38,987
太多伤兵了
We got too many wounded to move!

897
01:15:39,064 --> 01:15:42,295
让我带人手绕到坠机地点
Then give me some shooters and I'll circle us to the bird.

898
01:15:45,004 --> 01:15:47,495
葛姆，你在第四小队吗？
Grimes! You're with Chalk Four?

899
01:15:47,673 --> 01:15:48,697
是的，长官
Yes, sir!

900
01:15:48,908 --> 01:15:52,344
去跟反恐怖部队和艾中士会合
All right, hook up with Delta! Rejoin with Sergeant Eversmann.

901
01:15:52,912 --> 01:15:55,176
其他的人留守这里
The rest of you, secure this position!

902
01:15:55,381 --> 01:15:57,611
照顾伤兵，等待车队
Treat the wounded, we'll wait for the convoy!

903
01:15:57,683 --> 01:16:00,208
然后在坠机地点会合
Then we'll rally at the crash site. Roger!

904
01:16:00,419 --> 01:16:01,784
我的手下跟我走
My guys, let's go!

905
01:16:32,718 --> 01:16:34,610
两名反恐怖部队狙击手…
<i>C- 2, I have two Delta snipers,</i> <i>Shughart and Gordon...</i>

906
01:16:34,748 --> 01:16:35,710
舒哈和葛顿
...volunteering to secure crash site two. Over.

907
01:16:35,788 --> 01:16:38,584
自愿前往第二坠机地点，完毕

908
01:16:39,104 --> 01:16:43,488
不准，不能再牺牲另一架直升机
<i>No, Super 62, negative that request.</i> <i>Can't risk another bird.</i>

909
01:16:45,130 --> 01:16:49,066
我们不能确定有人生还
We don't see anything moving down there, we don't even know if anyone's alive.

910
01:16:50,336 --> 01:16:53,066
地面部队正在赶去
A ground team is being organized to go in now.

911
01:16:53,238 --> 01:16:54,967
多久能赶到？
ETA on ground team? Over.

912
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:58,234
不知道，不久吧
<i>Unknown, not long.</i>

913
01:16:58,410 --> 01:17:00,742
你们尽力从空中协助
Do what you can from the air.

914
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:06,513
大家过来
All right, gather around!

915
01:17:06,652 --> 01:17:09,883
杜伦坠毁了，我们要去救他
Durant's 64 is down. We're going back in to get him!

916
01:17:09,955 --> 01:17:12,082
你疯了，有人生还吗？
That's crazy. Is there anyone alive?

917
01:17:12,157 --> 01:17:14,557
无所谓，绝不能抛弃同胞
Doesn't matter, no one gets left behind.

918
01:17:14,793 --> 01:17:16,988
这是浪费时间
We're wasting time here.

919
01:17:17,162 --> 01:17:20,188
五分钟内重新整理弹药
Refit and max out ammo and grenades, you got five!

920
01:17:21,433 --> 01:17:23,264
塞斯莫，你想去哪儿？
Sizemore, where are you going?

921
01:17:23,335 --> 01:17:24,558
跟你们一起走
- With you guys. - Not with that cast on you're not.

922
01:17:24,705 --> 01:17:26,168
你受了伤不能去

923
01:17:27,039 --> 01:17:30,338
好吧，去拿头盔吧
All right, all right, all right. Go get your k-pot.

924
01:17:32,611 --> 01:17:33,805
说话呀
Talk to me.

925
01:17:34,113 --> 01:17:35,478
我不能再回去
I can't go back out there.

926
01:17:35,547 --> 01:17:40,109
汤玛斯，大家都很害怕
Thomas, everyone feels the same way you do. All right?

927
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:43,516
你现在的表现才重要
It's what you do right now that makes a difference.

928
01:17:44,556 --> 01:17:46,046
这是你的决定
It's your call.

929
01:17:46,492 --> 01:17:47,550
呼呀？
Hoo-ah?

930
01:17:53,732 --> 01:17:54,960
呼呀
Hoo-ah.

931
01:18:11,316 --> 01:18:14,945
最好把悍马车上的血迹冲掉
It'll probably help to wash the blood out of the humvees.

932
01:18:23,929 --> 01:18:25,863
史崔克中士
Sergeant Struecker!

933
01:18:26,532 --> 01:18:29,865
我能去吗？
Sergeant Struecker! Can I go, Sarge?

934
01:18:30,302 --> 01:18:32,202
你有弹药吗？　　　有
- You got some ammo? - Roger, Sarge!

935
01:18:32,371 --> 01:18:33,963
上来吧
Hop in!

936
01:18:51,990 --> 01:18:53,355
等等
Wait!

937
01:18:54,293 --> 01:18:56,454
来吧，上车
Let's go, Thomas. Get in!

938
01:19:20,252 --> 01:19:21,412
走哪儿？
Which way?

939
01:19:26,425 --> 01:19:29,417
那儿吧　　　别这么大声
- That way, I think! - Not so fucking loud.

940
01:20:03,195 --> 01:20:04,526
乖驴子
Nice donkey.

941
01:20:23,148 --> 01:20:24,547
游骑兵吗？
Rangers?

942
01:20:25,050 --> 01:20:26,039
你是谁？
Who?

943
01:20:26,885 --> 01:20:30,446
我是尤利，猪头
It's Yurek! You fucking assholes!

944
01:20:30,622 --> 01:20:32,021
可恶
Fuck!

945
01:20:32,224 --> 01:20:34,784
我们差点杀死你
Dude, we almost fucking killed you!

946
01:20:35,027 --> 01:20:38,121
你过来　　　可恶，你们过来
- Come to us! - Fuck you, come to me.

947
01:20:50,576 --> 01:20:51,907
对不起，中士
Sorry, Sarge!

948
01:20:52,077 --> 01:20:54,011
你上哪儿了？
Dude, where the fuck have you been?

949
01:20:54,079 --> 01:20:55,944
你带了夜视镜吗？
Never mind, you brought NOD, right?

950
01:20:56,014 --> 01:20:58,346
没有，你知道原因吗？
No, I didn't and you want to know why?

951
01:20:58,417 --> 01:21:01,784
因为你说半小时就能回基地
Because you said: "You won't need that, we'll be back in a half-hour<i>."</i>

952
01:21:01,854 --> 01:21:03,412
我不是跟你说的
Well, I wasn't saying it to you.

953
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:05,479
尼森，过来
Nelson, cover this way.

954
01:21:05,858 --> 01:21:07,450
我们需要夜视镜
We'll need night vision.

955
01:21:07,526 --> 01:21:09,926
你在等什么？
What's the matter with you?

956
01:21:10,295 --> 01:21:13,059
他聋了，都是我害的
Oh, he's deaf. It's my fault.

957
01:21:13,365 --> 01:21:15,629
我们一定要走　　　那儿
- We need to get out of here! - That way.

958
01:21:15,701 --> 01:21:19,364
离坠机地点不远了，在哪儿？
We can't be far from the crash. Which way?

959
01:21:20,038 --> 01:21:21,767
我以为你知道
I thought you might know.

960
01:21:22,507 --> 01:21:23,940
出发吧
Let's move out.

961
01:21:29,514 --> 01:21:32,074
尼森、汤比，请回答
<i>Nelson, Twombly? Come in. Over.</i>

962
01:21:33,151 --> 01:21:37,349
这是杰利顿，车队的位置在哪里？
Nelson, Twombly, this is Galentine. We need a position of the convoy. Over.

963
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:40,654
我联络不到他们
I can't raise them, Sergeant.

964
01:21:40,893 --> 01:21:43,555
我们快撤退吧
Sir, let's get the fuck out of here and evac!

965
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:48,090
快走吧　　　快回到据点
- Let's move out. - Back to the stronghold!

966
01:21:48,333 --> 01:21:49,322
走吧
Come on!

967
01:21:51,603 --> 01:21:54,834
地面部队占领几栋建筑物
Ground forces have occupied several buildings along Marehan Road...

968
01:21:54,907 --> 01:21:56,602
但是都分散开来
...but they're all spread out.

969
01:21:56,675 --> 01:21:58,312
艾中士的第四小队
Eversmann's Chalk Four has set up a perimeter around Wolcott's crash site.

970
01:21:58,465 --> 01:22:01,112
在威考的坠机地点建立防线

971
01:22:01,346 --> 01:22:03,678
狄马索在隔壁的大楼
DiTomasso is in the adjacent structure.

972
01:22:04,049 --> 01:22:06,505
史上尉的游骑兵队员在这儿
Captain Steele and about 40 men, Rangers, are here, a couple blocks away.

973
01:22:06,609 --> 01:22:07,985
两个街口外
They're banged up pretty bad.

974
01:22:08,053 --> 01:22:09,577
他们的情况很惨

975
01:22:09,655 --> 01:22:12,504
他设立了死伤聚集点
He set up a casualty collection point, I don't think they'll be able to move.

976
01:22:12,655 --> 01:22:14,524
没办法前进

977
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:17,251
桑德森中士率领手下
Sergeant Sanderson and a small Delta team...

978
01:22:17,329 --> 01:22:21,197
正在赶往坠机地点
...are moving from Steele's position to the crash site as we speak.

979
01:22:32,210 --> 01:22:33,370
把炮火引开
Draw off fire!

980
01:22:33,445 --> 01:22:36,505
等对方装子弹就掩护我
When this asshole stops to reload, cover me!

981
01:22:36,715 --> 01:22:38,148
快　　　长官
- Go! - Sir.

982
01:22:41,653 --> 01:22:42,620
再来
Again!

983
01:22:47,726 --> 01:22:49,193
掩护我
Loading!

984
01:22:51,563 --> 01:22:53,053
继续
Keep going!

985
01:22:53,799 --> 01:22:55,528
卡住了
I'm jammed!

986
01:22:56,702 --> 01:22:58,169
让我来
I got it!

987
01:22:59,404 --> 01:23:01,167
该死
No, shit!

988
01:23:13,752 --> 01:23:15,014
火箭弹
RPG!

989
01:23:29,968 --> 01:23:32,528
你没事吧？
You all right? You okay?

990
01:23:32,704 --> 01:23:35,673
没事，我死不了
Yeah. I can hear bells ringing.

991
01:23:37,275 --> 01:23:39,505
快，来吧
Come on! Come on!

992
01:23:41,246 --> 01:23:42,235
走吧
Go!

993
01:23:49,454 --> 01:23:52,423
有一群人正走向坠机地点
<i>A crowd is advancing six,</i> <i>seven blocks from the crash.</i>

994
01:23:52,524 --> 01:23:54,822
舒哈和葛顿再度请求
<i>Shughart and Gordon</i> <i>again request permission...</i>

995
01:23:54,893 --> 01:23:58,329
前往坠机地点进行救援
...to secure until convoy arrives. Over.

996
01:23:58,530 --> 01:24:01,590
人群增加到好几百人
General, crowds are in the hundreds now.

997
01:24:01,833 --> 01:24:05,291
他们看得会比我们清楚
<i>From where they are,</i> <i>they can see things clearer than any of us.</i>

998
01:24:05,404 --> 01:24:07,304
他们很清楚状况
<i>They know what they're asking.</i>

999
01:24:07,506 --> 01:24:08,973
让我跟他们说
Let me talk to them.

1000
01:24:09,174 --> 01:24:10,266
这是盖将军
<i>This is Garrison.</i>

1001
01:24:10,342 --> 01:24:12,808
我要确定你们很清楚状况
<i>I want to make sure that you understand</i> <i>what you're asking, so say it out loud.</i>

1002
01:24:12,942 --> 01:24:14,608
大声地说出来

1003
01:24:16,681 --> 01:24:20,674
我们要求在坠机地点建立防线
We're asking to go in and set up a perimeter until ground support arrives.

1004
01:24:21,019 --> 01:24:25,183
支援部队没那么快赶到
You realize that I cannot tell you when that might be, it could take a while.

1005
01:24:26,091 --> 01:24:28,616
我知道　　　你们还是要去？
- Roger that. <i>- You still want to go in there?</i>

1006
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:29,756
是，长官
Yes, sir.

1007
01:24:33,765 --> 01:24:35,392
哈中校　　　是，将军
- Colonel Harrell? <i>- Yes, General?</i>

1008
01:24:35,467 --> 01:24:36,525
这是你的决定
It's your call.

1009
01:24:37,702 --> 01:24:39,192
收到
Roger that.

1010
01:24:40,972 --> 01:24:43,167
把他们送过去
<i>Goffena, put them in.</i>

1011
01:24:57,089 --> 01:24:58,852
该死，该死
Motherfucker. Motherfucker.

1012
01:25:04,029 --> 01:25:05,018
火箭弹
RPG!

1013
01:25:14,906 --> 01:25:16,498
建立防线
Set up your perimeter!

1014
01:25:23,949 --> 01:25:25,940
他身上有火箭弹
There's a fucking rocket in him, sir!

1015
01:25:26,017 --> 01:25:29,885
冷静点，它会爆炸，快走
Othic, calm down, goddamn it! There's live ordnance, now get out!

1016
01:25:31,189 --> 01:25:33,020
可恶
Son of a bitch.

1017
01:25:34,526 --> 01:25:37,689
把他抬起来，小心点
All right, lift him up! Lift him up! Easy, easy!

1018
01:25:37,996 --> 01:25:41,090
把他抬上车，很好
All right, get him in there! Good, good! Easy, easy!

1019
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:43,824
快上车，开车
Get in that truck and drive.

1020
01:25:43,902 --> 01:25:45,961
我受伤了　　　大家都受伤了
- But I'm shot, Colonel. - Everybody's shot.

1021
01:25:46,037 --> 01:25:48,130
把人犯送回去
We need the prisoners! Let's go!

1022
01:25:49,207 --> 01:25:52,699
你要开到哈瓦迪街直走
<i>Surveillance says to take Hawlwadig,</i> <i>then go straight.</i>

1023
01:25:52,944 --> 01:25:57,210
我要你回头开到哈瓦迪街
McKnight, we need you to turn around and head back to Hawlwadig.

1024
01:25:57,382 --> 01:25:59,646
拜托，我们才从那儿来
You're shitting me! We just came through there!

1025
01:25:59,718 --> 01:26:01,481
一定有更好的路线
There must be a better route!

1026
01:26:01,553 --> 01:26:05,418
这是指挥中心的情报
That's the info I'm getting from JOC, you need to turn around and head back.

1027
01:26:05,563 --> 01:26:06,818
你要调头回去

1028
01:26:08,193 --> 01:26:10,018
收到了…
Roger that. Roger that.

1029
01:26:10,495 --> 01:26:13,362
我不敢相信，快调头
I cannot believe this shit! Turn us around, Maddox.

1030
01:26:13,431 --> 01:26:15,399
他们会把我们害死
They're trying to get us fucking killed!

1031
01:26:15,467 --> 01:26:17,059
快开车吧
Just get it over with! Drive!

1032
01:26:17,135 --> 01:26:18,124
该死
Goddamn!

1033
01:26:18,403 --> 01:26:20,735
快走吧，开车
Get us out of here, goddamn it, drive!

1034
01:26:28,446 --> 01:26:29,879
快踩油门
Keep your foot on the gas!

1035
01:26:29,948 --> 01:26:32,178
快踩油门
Keep your foot on the gas!

1036
01:26:43,695 --> 01:26:44,753
去死
Fuck!

1037
01:26:47,699 --> 01:26:48,688
该死
Shit.

1038
01:27:04,149 --> 01:27:06,913
舒哈和葛顿下去了
<i>C- 2, Shughart and Gordon</i> <i>are on the deck. Over.</i>

1039
01:27:07,118 --> 01:27:08,085
收到
<i>Roger.</i>

1040
01:27:34,179 --> 01:27:35,737
是友军！别开枪
Friendlies!

1041
01:27:37,916 --> 01:27:39,144
天啊，见到你真好
God, it's good to see you!

1042
01:27:39,217 --> 01:27:41,185
你也是，你伤得多重？
It's good to see you. How bad?

1043
01:27:41,253 --> 01:27:44,154
我的腿断了，我的背很痛
My leg's broken and my back feels kind of weird.

1044
01:27:44,289 --> 01:27:46,382
我们要把你救出去
We've got to get you out of here.

1045
01:27:47,359 --> 01:27:49,190
我把他拉出来
I'm pulling him out! Cover!

1046
01:27:52,597 --> 01:27:53,586
等等
Wait, I...

1047
01:28:02,140 --> 01:28:03,402
我把你放下来
I'm putting you down.

1048
01:28:03,642 --> 01:28:06,577
我们在坠机地点建立防线
C-2, we're at the 64 crash site, securing perimeter.

1049
01:28:06,645 --> 01:28:08,237
你还好吧？　　　我还好
- You all right? - Yeah, I'm good.

1050
01:28:08,313 --> 01:28:09,746
枪上膛了
You're locked and loaded.

1051
01:28:09,814 --> 01:28:13,545
后面有敌人就帮我们解决掉
Any skinnies come around these corners, you watch our backs.

1052
01:28:13,618 --> 01:28:16,280
救援部队呢？　　　我们就是了
- Where's the rescue squad? - We're it.

1053
01:28:21,993 --> 01:28:25,087
好了，停车
All right, stop, stop, Maddox. Stop.

1054
01:28:26,097 --> 01:28:27,564
可恶
Son of a bitch.

1055
01:28:27,666 --> 01:28:30,533
我们又回到原点
Romeo 64, we're back where we started.

1056
01:28:30,769 --> 01:28:33,465
弹药快用完了，大家都受伤
I'm low on ammo, I got many wounded including me...

1057
01:28:33,538 --> 01:28:35,506
车辆几乎毁损
...vehicles that are barely running.

1058
01:28:35,573 --> 01:28:38,508
好了，你就老实说吧
<i>Okay, Danny,</i> <i>I need a no-b.s. Assessment here.</i>

1059
01:28:38,943 --> 01:28:41,070
你能到坠机地点吗？
Can you get to the crash site?

1060
01:28:41,813 --> 01:28:44,407
我什么也看不到
Colonel, I can't see shit.

1061
01:28:48,486 --> 01:28:49,384
不能
Negative.

1062
01:28:49,454 --> 01:28:52,514
伤兵太多，我们去也没用
<i>With the amount of wounded we have,</i> <i>we'd do more harm than good.</i>

1063
01:28:52,590 --> 01:28:55,049
我们要回基地补充弹药
<i>We need to come back to base, rearm</i> <i>and regroup and then we can go back out.</i>

1064
01:28:55,190 --> 01:28:56,549
然后再回来
Roger.

1065
01:28:56,628 --> 01:28:57,617
收到

1066
01:28:59,464 --> 01:29:02,729
把他们叫回来，叫他们快走
C-2, bring them back. Get them out of there.

1067
01:29:04,202 --> 01:29:05,794
收到，回基地吧
Roger. Return to base.

1068
01:29:06,604 --> 01:29:07,969
我们要回去了
We're going home!

1069
01:29:08,173 --> 01:29:10,164
走吧，左转
Let's go. Left.

1070
01:29:18,483 --> 01:29:22,442
（下午4点54分）

1071
01:29:23,088 --> 01:29:26,387
收到了，车队要回基地
<i>Roger that. Understand.</i> <i>Convoy returning to base.</i>

1072
01:29:31,663 --> 01:29:33,756
怎么回事？　　　车队被叫回去了
- What's up? - They're sending them back.

1073
01:29:33,832 --> 01:29:35,493
车队要回基地
The convoy's headed back to base camp.

1074
01:29:35,567 --> 01:29:37,728
这太妙了
Oh, now that makes sense, don't it?

1075
01:29:38,236 --> 01:29:42,263
我们要赶紧把伤兵送回去
We need to exfil the wounded now and get out of here before it's too late!

1076
01:29:42,607 --> 01:29:46,168
麦中校要回基地一定有理由
If Colonel McKnight went back to base, then he had a good reason.

1077
01:29:46,344 --> 01:29:47,811
我们的任务不变
It changes nothing.

1078
01:29:48,012 --> 01:29:49,411
大伙儿听好
All right, listen up.

1079
01:29:49,481 --> 01:29:53,474
我们要守住这个据点
We're going to hold the perimeter and we're going to hold the strongpoint.

1080
01:29:54,252 --> 01:29:57,517
保留弹药，有必要才开枪
Conserve your ammo. Only shoot at what you can hit.

1081
01:29:59,324 --> 01:30:01,121
车队一定会回来
The convoy is going to come.

1082
01:30:02,527 --> 01:30:03,516
我们一定能回家
We're going to get home.

1083
01:30:16,007 --> 01:30:16,996
掩护我
Loading!

1084
01:30:25,483 --> 01:30:26,814
掩护我
Loading!

1085
01:30:27,352 --> 01:30:29,149
蓝迪，我要弹匣
Randy, I need a pistol mag!

1086
01:30:42,534 --> 01:30:43,523
掩护我
Loading!

1087
01:30:47,272 --> 01:30:48,671
最后一个弹匣
Randy, last mag!

1088
01:30:52,177 --> 01:30:53,201
葛顿
Gordy!

1089
01:30:56,948 --> 01:30:57,937
该死
Fuck!

1090
01:31:11,429 --> 01:31:13,624
葛顿死了，我出去拼了
Gordy is gone, man. I'll be outside.

1091
01:31:14,199 --> 01:31:15,325
祝好运
Good luck.

1092
01:31:36,754 --> 01:31:39,621
快向第十山地师求救
We need the 10th Mountain in there. Everything they got.

1093
01:31:39,691 --> 01:31:41,219
我要巴基斯坦、马来西亚…
Pakistanis, Malays, I want their tanks and APCs.

1094
01:31:41,291 --> 01:31:43,019
军队的坦克和装甲车

1095
01:31:43,461 --> 01:31:44,860
他们不知道我们的行动
They don't know we've gone in.

1096
01:31:44,929 --> 01:31:46,766
我们捅出了大篓子
We have stirred up a hornet's nest here. We're fighting the entire city.

1097
01:31:46,919 --> 01:31:49,366
整个城市都在攻击我们

1098
01:31:49,868 --> 01:31:52,832
我要每一辆军事车辆的支援
I want every vehicle possible that's got 4 wheels and armor. Get everything.

1099
01:31:52,988 --> 01:31:54,532
快去找，快去

1100
01:31:54,739 --> 01:31:58,038
我要他们我们的弟兄救出敌区
Once they've assembled, we'll move our men out of the hostile area...

1101
01:31:58,109 --> 01:32:00,703
安全送到巴基斯坦军队的基地
...and back to the Pakistani Stadium, the safe zone.

1102
01:32:00,778 --> 01:32:03,303
快去吧　　　遵命，长官

1133
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:11,150
小心敌人，他们在屋顶
Watch out for skinnies. They're on the rooftops.

1134
01:37:11,222 --> 01:37:13,713
他们的祷告就快结束了
<i>They're in prayer but not for much longer.</i>

1135
01:37:17,195 --> 01:37:18,992
别向东边开火

我们看到直升机，你在哪里？

我们要走了
We got to go.

1143
01:38:02,673 --> 01:38:05,608

01:38:05,776 --> 01:38:06,835
等他过了马路
When he gets across the street, he'll turn around and cover you as you run.

1145
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:09,735

你到了那儿也要掩护我，好吗？

1148
01:38:15,586 --> 01:38:17,918
你不能直接跑去找艾中士
You won't just run to Eversmann's position.

1149
01:38:17,989 --> 01:38:20,822
你要停下来掩护我
You're going to stop and you are going to cover me.

1150
01:38:21,325 --> 01:38:23,486
你一定要搞清楚这点
It's important you understand that.

1151
01:38:23,961 --> 01:38:25,326
好了吗？
Okay, you ready?

1152
01:38:26,130 --> 01:38:27,495
好了
Yeah, I guess.

1153
01:38:33,070 --> 01:38:34,628

出去吧
Let's move out.

1158
01:39:01,299 --> 01:39:03,028
你能掩护我们吗？
Can you cover us, Sergeant?

1159
01:39:03,267 --> 01:39:04,598
没问题
We got you.

1160
01:39:11,842 --> 01:39:13,241

抬起来，1、2、3
Up, one, two, three.

我需要帮手
I need more men in here.

1177
01:40:20,044 --> 01:40:22,638
汤比、尼森

1178
01:40:22,713 --> 01:40:25,773
压住他　　　真是…
- Put him down. - Oh, man, that really<i>...</i>

真是很痛　　　直接施加压力
- It really hurts! - Direct pressure on that.

1180
01:40:29,420 --> 01:40:30,910
没事的
It's okay, it's okay.

1181
01:40:31,489 --> 01:40:33,855
让我看　　　好了

I need you to suck it up, Sarg'nt. I need you to focus.

01:41:06,323 --> 01:41:10,316
谁敢闯进来就让他吃子弹
Anybody comes through that door gets two in the chest and one in the head.

1197
01:41:10,661 --> 01:41:14,097
明白吗？　　　我可以打仗
- You understand? - I'm still in the fight, sir.

1198
01:41:14,365 --> 01:41:17,300

<i>Captain Steele,</i> <i>I need a medivac in here now!</i>

1199
01:41:17,501 --> 01:41:19,992

他伤得很重
He's hurt pretty bad.

1202
01:41:23,374 --> 01:41:27,105

1203
01:41:27,178 --> 01:41:29,738

25号，这是64号
25, this is 64. Negative on the medivac. It's not possible.

1210
01:41:49,789 --> 01:41:52,033
没有医疗救援，战况太激烈

1211
01:41:52,236 --> 01:41:54,302
不能再冒险派救援直升机
<i>JOC cannot risk another bird.</i> <i>You'll just have to hold on.</i>

1212
01:41:54,456 --> 01:41:56,002

这是我的直升机

这是凯罗11号
This is Kilo 11. I'm at the Durant crash site.

1218
01:42:55,945 --> 01:42:57,893

- They're still debating the route. <i>- How long?</i>

1224
01:43:27,482 --> 01:43:29,830
长官，他们还在讨论路线

1225
01:43:30,032 --> 01:43:31,130
还要多久？
At least a couple of hours.

1226
01:43:31,268 --> 01:43:32,895
至少两个小时

1227
01:43:33,070 --> 01:43:34,731
来不及了
We haven't got that long, Joe.

1228
01:43:34,805 --> 01:43:36,801
巴基斯坦将军说…
Pakistani General says, since we didn't deign to inform him of the raid...

1229
01:43:36,955 --> 01:43:39,401
我们事先没有通知他们

1230
01:43:39,610 --> 01:43:43,444
动员第十山地师要花点时间
...it'll take some time to mobilize the 10th Mountain and 100 vehicles.

1231
01:43:43,514 --> 01:43:45,505
你告诉他
You tell the general this:

1232
01:43:45,716 --> 01:43:48,617
我了解，但是我也要提醒他
I understand, but it is my duty to remind him...

1233
01:43:48,819 --> 01:43:52,880
我的手下被武装民兵团团包围
...that my men are surrounded by thousands of armed Somali militia.

1234
01:43:53,090 --> 01:43:58,357
我们必须立刻把他们救出敌区
It's imperative that we move them out of the hostile area and into the safe zone.

1235
01:43:58,562 --> 01:44:00,086
我需要他的帮助
I need his help now.

Yes, sir.

1237
01:44:07,438 --> 01:44:08,666
杜伦
Durant.

1238
01:44:09,373 --> 01:44:11,841
迈可杜伦
Michael Durant.

1239
01:44:12,576 --> 01:44:13,565
是的
Yes.

1240
01:44:14,044 --> 01:44:16,444
你是杀我同胞的游骑兵队员？
You are the Ranger who kills my people?

1241
01:44:16,847 --> 01:44:20,248
我不是，我是驾驶员
I'm not a Ranger. I'm a pilot.

1242
01:44:24,188 --> 01:44:25,285
没错
That's right.

1243
01:44:26,156 --> 01:44:28,948
美国人不抽烟了
None of you Americans smoke anymore.

1244
01:44:32,362 --> 01:44:36,792
你们都过着无趣的生活
You all live long, dull, uninteresting lives.

1245
01:44:38,969 --> 01:44:40,534
你为什么要抓我？
What do you want with me?

1246
01:44:41,372 --> 01:44:43,101
你们手上有我们的人质
You have taken hostages.

1247
01:44:44,508 --> 01:44:45,900
我们手上有你
We have you.

1248
01:44:46,209 --> 01:44:49,003
美国政府才不会跟你谈判
My government will never negotiate for me.

1249
01:44:49,746 --> 01:44:54,108
那么我就跟你谈判吧
Then perhaps you and I can negotiate, huh?

1250
01:44:55,786 --> 01:44:58,111
我们都是军人
Soldier to soldier.

1251
01:45:04,661 --> 01:45:05,958
我不是指挥官
I'm not in charge.

1252
01:45:09,333 --> 01:45:10,570
当然不是
Course not. You have the power to kill, but not negotiate.

1253
01:45:10,733 --> 01:45:13,570
你们能杀人却不能谈判

1254
01:45:14,338 --> 01:45:17,339
在索马利亚，杀人就是谈判
In Somalia, killing is negotiation.

1255
01:45:18,809 --> 01:45:22,176
你们真的以为，抓到艾迪德将军…
Do you really think if you get General Aidid...

1256
01:45:22,379 --> 01:45:25,746
我们就会放下武器
...we will simply put down our weapons...

1257
01:45:25,882 --> 01:45:28,874
接受美式民主
...and adopt American democracy?

1258
01:45:29,319 --> 01:45:31,116
或是停止杀戮吗？
That the killing will stop?

1259
01:45:31,521 --> 01:45:35,582
我只知道，没有胜利就没有和平
We know this: Without victory, there can be no peace.

1260
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:38,794
杀戮永远不会停止
There will always be killing, you see?

1261
01:45:39,262 --> 01:45:43,257
这就是我们的方法，迈可杜伦
This is how things are in our world.

1262
01:45:54,311 --> 01:45:57,974
迈可杜伦，我们不会抛弃你
<i>Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind.</i>

1263
01:46:00,117 --> 01:46:03,553
迈可杜伦，我们不会抛弃你
<i>Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind.</i>

1264
01:46:06,289 --> 01:46:09,156
换你来，用双手按住
You got to take over from me. Both hands.

1265
01:46:16,867 --> 01:46:20,098
伤口在股动脉，但是我看不到
It's the femoral artery, but I can't see it.

1266
01:46:20,303 --> 01:46:23,761
它一定缩进骨盆
Which means that it's retracted up into the pelvis.

1267
01:46:23,974 --> 01:46:28,274
我必须把它夹住，这样才能止血
I have to find it and clamp it. It's the only way to stop the bleeding.

1268
01:46:28,478 --> 01:46:30,571
麻醉剂用完了
I got no more IVs.

1269
01:46:31,848 --> 01:46:34,749
所以我要你帮忙，好吗？
So, I'm going to need you to assist. Okay?

1270
01:46:34,885 --> 01:46:36,512
好
Yeah, yeah.

1271
01:46:37,454 --> 01:46:40,821
听好，我要做一件事
Now listen, Jamie. I got to do something, it's going to hurt.

1272
01:46:42,092 --> 01:46:45,789
你会很痛，不过我必须帮助你
I got to cause you more pain, but I have to do it to help you.

1273
01:46:45,996 --> 01:46:47,520
你懂吗？
All right, you understand?

1274
01:46:47,597 --> 01:46:49,588
吗啡　　　不行
- Morphine. - I can't.

1275
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:52,394
那会降低你的心跳
It'll lower your heart rate too far. I'm sorry.

1276
01:46:52,469 --> 01:46:54,767
汤比，抓住他的手
Twombly, why don't you take his hands?

1277
01:46:59,276 --> 01:47:02,211
把伤口撑开，压住他的大腿
Hold the wound open, keep pressure on the top of the leg.

1278
01:47:02,279 --> 01:47:04,474
尤利，帮我拿手电筒
Yurek, take the feet and a flashlight.

1279
01:47:04,881 --> 01:47:06,007
我数到三
On my count.

1280
01:47:06,083 --> 01:47:08,074
准备好了
All right, Jamie. All right.

1281
01:47:10,353 --> 01:47:12,514
1、2…
One. Two.

1282
01:47:13,457 --> 01:47:14,515
Three.

1283
01:47:22,232 --> 01:47:24,666
等等，摸到了
Wait, wait. Okay. I feel it.

1284
01:47:25,302 --> 01:47:26,667
我摸到脉搏
I feel the pulse.

1285
01:47:28,238 --> 01:47:29,569
我找到了
I got it. I got it.

1286
01:47:29,639 --> 01:47:31,231
找到了…
I got it, yeah. I got it.

1287
01:47:31,308 --> 01:47:32,900
找到了？　　　找到了
- I got it. - You got it?

1288
01:47:33,343 --> 01:47:34,332
夹子
Clamp?

1289
01:47:36,747 --> 01:47:38,112
钳住了
I got it clamped.

1290
01:47:38,248 --> 01:47:39,442
拿住　　　好
- Hold it. - Got it.

1291
01:47:39,516 --> 01:47:40,778
这里，抓住
Here, grab it.

1292
01:47:41,451 --> 01:47:43,180
它破了　　　我抓住了
- It's tearing. - I got it.

1293
01:47:43,420 --> 01:47:45,285
它又缩回去了　　　抓住它
- Doc, it's going back in! - Hold it!

1294
01:47:45,355 --> 01:47:46,583
破了
It's tearing!

1295
01:47:46,923 --> 01:47:49,892
出来，撑开伤口　　　撑开了
- Okay. Get out. Hold the wound. - Okay, I'm holding.

1296
01:47:51,128 --> 01:47:52,425
把手拿开
Move your hand.

1297
01:48:03,640 --> 01:48:04,868
怎么了？
What?

1298
01:48:23,994 --> 01:48:24,983
治好了吗？
Fix it?

1299
01:48:28,598 --> 01:48:31,032
对，治好了
Yeah, yeah. We got it.

1300
01:48:46,683 --> 01:48:48,480
你在干什么？
What the hell are you doing?

1301
01:48:48,552 --> 01:48:50,305
关键是磨咖啡豆
It's all in the grind, Sarg'nt. Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.

1302
01:48:50,452 --> 01:48:52,955
不能磨得太细或太粗

1303
01:48:53,156 --> 01:48:55,818
葛姆，你都弄好了
Grimesy, you are squared away.

1304
01:49:12,142 --> 01:49:16,101
来一杯热腾腾的咖啡吧
Sarg'nt, how would you like a nice hot cup of Joe?

1305
01:49:17,914 --> 01:49:19,506
黄金海岸口味
Gold Coast blend.

1306
01:49:19,716 --> 01:49:22,651
坐下来，我看你的伤口
Sit down. I want to take a look at that foot.

1307
01:49:23,253 --> 01:49:25,346
这不算什么　　　来
- No, it's not a problem. - Come on.

1308
01:49:31,795 --> 01:49:33,289
他们从哪儿把你找来的？
- Where the hell did they find you? - Behind a desk.

1309
01:49:33,435 --> 01:49:34,889
办公桌后面

1310
01:49:36,399 --> 01:49:39,425
是真的，我没开玩笑
No, really. What, you think I'm kidding?

1311
01:49:43,106 --> 01:49:44,903
有人受伤吗？　　　没有
- Is anybody hit? - We're good!

1312
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:51,440
你们没事吧？
You all right?

1313
01:49:51,514 --> 01:49:52,503
没事
Yeah!

1314
01:49:52,716 --> 01:49:54,183
大家都没事吧？
Is everybody all right?

1315
01:49:54,251 --> 01:49:55,275
没事
Yeah!

1316
01:50:09,299 --> 01:50:10,493
火箭弹
Incoming!

1317
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:25,614
继续开火，快点
<i>Keep firing... faster!</i>

1318
01:51:16,066 --> 01:51:18,057
狄马索中弹，快救他
DiTomasso's hit! Pull him out!

1319
01:51:51,534 --> 01:51:53,263
这是凯罗11号
Ranger here. This is Kilo 11.

1320
01:51:53,336 --> 01:51:56,567
我们在东南角，你是谁？
Chalk Four. We're at the southeast corner of the crash. Who's this?

1321
01:51:56,639 --> 01:51:58,630
胡特，我带了三名同胞来
<i>This is Hoot.</i> <i>I'm coming with three friendlies.</i>

1322
01:51:58,708 --> 01:52:00,369
请掩护我
I need cover fire. Over.

1323
01:52:00,443 --> 01:52:01,608
收到，凯罗11号
Roger, Kilo 11. Hold your fire! Deltas coming in.

1324
01:52:01,743 --> 01:52:03,378
停火，反恐怖部队来了

1325
01:52:03,446 --> 01:52:05,471
停火
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

1326
01:52:10,186 --> 01:52:15,016
地面部队要用红外线求生灯做记号
Ground personnel will have to mark target positions with infrared strobes.

1327
01:52:15,492 --> 01:52:19,258
派出攻击直升机向敌人扫射
Get little birds on strafing runs and keep them going all night long.

1328
01:52:19,362 --> 01:52:21,626
如果控制不了状况
If we don't hold back this city...

1329
01:52:22,332 --> 01:52:25,324
我们的死伤会很惨重
...we'll have a 100 caskets to fill by morning.

1330
01:52:25,535 --> 01:52:26,763
是，长官
Yes, sir.

1331
01:52:26,970 --> 01:52:29,704
第一坠机地点的地面部队
Colonel Harrell, ground personnel at crash site one...

1332
01:52:29,806 --> 01:52:32,000
要用红外线求生灯…
<i>... will have to mark the target</i> <i>with infrared strobes to prep for air strike.</i>

1333
01:52:32,156 --> 01:52:34,000
在目标上做记号

1334
01:52:34,157 --> 01:52:36,656
（巴基斯坦体育场）

1335
01:52:39,582 --> 01:52:40,810
麦中校
McKnight.

1336
01:52:44,888 --> 01:52:48,483
第十山地师的支援部队就够了
Between the 10th Mountain and U.N., we got enough personnel, okay?

1337
01:52:49,826 --> 01:52:52,624
你们不必再回去
Danny, you guys do not have to go back out again.

1338
01:53:05,175 --> 01:53:11,080
（晚上11点23分）

1339
01:53:12,782 --> 01:53:15,342
我不能死在这儿
I can't die here, man.

1340
01:53:16,519 --> 01:53:20,615
你不会死的，你不会死
You're not going to die, all right? You're not going to die.

1341
01:53:21,524 --> 01:53:22,991
对不起
I'm sorry.

1342
01:53:23,193 --> 01:53:26,458
你不必道歉
You don't have anything to be sorry for.

1343
01:53:26,629 --> 01:53:29,792
你救了汤比，你干得很好
You saved Twombly. You did perfect.

1344
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:32,467
汤比，你没事吧？
You okay, Twombs?

1345
01:53:33,036 --> 01:53:34,867
我没事
Yeah, I'm okay, Jamie.

1346
01:53:36,206 --> 01:53:38,401
你是个好军人
You did what you were trained to do.

1347
01:53:39,342 --> 01:53:41,207
你应该感到自傲
You should be proud of that.

1348
01:53:44,314 --> 01:53:45,645
你要感到骄傲
Be proud of that.

1349
01:53:46,483 --> 01:53:48,348
小艾　　　什么事？
- Ev? - Yeah.

1350
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:51,651
帮我一个忙
Do me a favor.

1351
01:53:54,724 --> 01:53:59,661
跟我父母说，我今天很英勇
You tell my parents that I fought well today.

1352
01:54:07,103 --> 01:54:08,968
我也尽了全力
And that I fought hard.

1353
01:54:10,940 --> 01:54:13,408
你要亲口跟他们说
You're going to tell them yourself, okay?

1354
01:54:13,476 --> 01:54:14,807
听到吗？
Do you hear me?

1355
01:54:16,613 --> 01:54:17,671
好吗？
All right?

1356
01:54:19,816 --> 01:54:21,344
悍马车队来了吗？
- Are the humvees here? - They're coming, Jamie.

1357
01:54:21,616 --> 01:54:22,944
他们来了

1358
01:54:23,453 --> 01:54:25,284
来了
They're coming.

1359
01:54:25,455 --> 01:54:27,719
你要撑下去
You just got to hang in there a little bit.

1360
01:54:27,790 --> 01:54:30,281
再多撑一下子　　　小意思
- You hold on for just a little bit. - I can.

1361
01:54:30,460 --> 01:54:31,620
我行的
I can.

1362
01:54:32,996 --> 01:54:34,463
没问题…
It's nothing.

1363
01:54:35,698 --> 01:54:37,131
没问题
It's nothing.

1364
01:54:38,168 --> 01:54:39,294
没问题
It's nothing.

1365
01:54:39,369 --> 01:54:41,701
没问题　　　没问题
- It's nothing. - It's nothing.

1366
01:54:42,639 --> 01:54:43,799
没问题
Nothing.

1367
01:54:51,481 --> 01:54:52,470
可恶
Oh, shit.

1368
01:54:53,483 --> 01:54:54,814
压住伤口
Hold the wound.

1369
01:55:21,844 --> 01:55:23,141
医官
Doc.

1370
01:55:26,015 --> 01:55:27,039
医官
Doc.

1371
01:55:44,133 --> 01:55:45,464
没事
It's okay.

1372
01:56:12,095 --> 01:56:13,562
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

1373
01:56:16,933 --> 01:56:18,662
我们需要弹药
We need the ammo.

1374
01:56:26,943 --> 01:56:28,740
你已经尽了力
You did all you could here.

1375
01:56:29,279 --> 01:56:31,509
他们应该派直升机救援
They should've sent a medivac.

1376
01:56:32,015 --> 01:56:35,678
它一定会被击落
Right now we'd be out there defending another crashed chopper.

1377
01:56:35,952 --> 01:56:38,443
更多人会受伤
More men would get torn up.

1378
01:56:41,457 --> 01:56:42,788
也许吧
Maybe.

1379
01:56:43,293 --> 01:56:46,160
别想那么多
See, you're thinking. Don't.

1380
01:56:46,262 --> 01:56:49,288
你不能决定谁受伤
Because, Sergeant, you can't control who gets hit or who doesn't.

1381
01:56:49,365 --> 01:56:52,129
或是谁从直升机上摔落
Who falls out of a chopper or why.

1382
01:56:52,335 --> 01:56:54,963
这是战争，你也无能为力
It ain't up to you. It's just war.

1383
01:56:56,973 --> 01:56:58,964
史密斯还是死了
Yeah, well, Smith's still dead.

1384
01:57:00,643 --> 01:57:03,009
都因贝克朋摔下来
- This all happened because Blackburn fell. - Should have, could have, don't matter.

1385
01:57:03,153 --> 01:57:05,239
想这么多也没用

1386
01:57:05,415 --> 01:57:09,181
以后你有的是时间去想
You'll get plenty of time to think about all that later. Believe me.

1387
01:57:12,955 --> 01:57:16,083
你把弟兄们带到这儿
Sergeant, you got your men this far.

1388
01:57:16,926 --> 01:57:18,621
你已经尽了全力
You did it right today.

1389
01:57:18,828 --> 01:57:22,286
你要想该怎么把他们救出去
You need to start thinking about getting these men out of here.

1390
01:57:28,705 --> 01:57:30,605
走吧
Well, shall we?

1391
01:57:39,349 --> 01:57:42,443
我要四个人守住这角落
I need four guys in this corner now!

1392
01:57:48,624 --> 01:57:50,216
火箭弹
RPG!

1393
01:57:54,130 --> 01:57:56,621
我准备进行机关枪扫射
<i>This is Barber 52 in position for gun run.</i>

1394
01:57:56,699 --> 01:57:58,826
老天爷，你看看
Jesus Christ. Look at that.

1395
01:57:59,535 --> 01:58:02,561
我看到了，你就在我上方
This is 25! I can see you. You're right above me.

1396
01:58:02,739 --> 01:58:04,605
我分不出谁是敌谁是友
Eversmann, I can't tell who's who down there. Too much activity.

1397
01:58:04,739 --> 01:58:06,175
状况太混乱了

1398
01:58:06,242 --> 01:58:08,733
我会用红外线求生灯做记号
I'll mark the target with a strobe! Over.

1399
01:58:08,978 --> 01:58:10,138
收到
Roger that.

1400
01:58:21,924 --> 01:58:23,084
看到吗？
<i>You see it?</i>

1401
01:58:25,428 --> 01:58:27,020
我什么也看不到
Nah, I can't see shit.

1402
01:58:27,997 --> 01:58:30,864
我要丢到屋顶　　　你需要帮忙
- I'm putting it on the roof. - You're going to need help!

1403
01:58:30,933 --> 01:58:31,922
掩护我
Cover me.

1404
01:58:33,136 --> 01:58:36,902
我数到三，就开枪掩护他
Okay, guys, we're going to lay down some cover fire for him on three!

1405
01:58:37,106 --> 01:58:38,095
好了吗？
Ready?

1406
01:58:38,274 --> 01:58:39,263
One.

1407
01:58:40,610 --> 01:58:42,339
3，开枪
Two.

1408
01:58:40,610 --> 01:58:42,339
Three. Go!

1409
01:59:14,911 --> 01:59:18,347
我看到目标了，准备进行扫射
I got your position. I got the target. We're inbound and hot.

1410
01:59:42,939 --> 01:59:47,603
C-2，弹药用完了，请求返回基地
<i>C- 2, miniguns dry. Request permission</i> <i>to return to base. Rearm. Over.</i>

1411
01:59:47,777 --> 01:59:50,610
收到，第二队前往支援
<i>Roger that. Second team inbound.</i> <i>Your station.</i>

1412
01:59:50,780 --> 01:59:52,975
四分钟后抵达
<i>On your location, four minutes.</i>

1413
02:00:01,123 --> 02:00:04,183
车队来了，准备走了
All right, they're here. Get the wounded ready to move.

1414
02:00:04,660 --> 02:00:07,094
掩护我们
Lay down some cover fire!

1415
02:00:09,432 --> 02:00:11,525
我早就听到你们了
I thought I heard a noise out here!

1416
02:00:11,601 --> 02:00:13,211
准备好，我们要出发了
- Load up. We're getting out of here. - Yes, sir.

1417
02:00:13,311 --> 02:00:14,331
是，长官

1418
02:00:17,507 --> 02:00:19,050
25号，这是64号
25, this is 64. The rescue column's here and will be with you in about 5 minutes.

1419
02:00:19,207 --> 02:00:22,240
救援车队出发了，五分钟后抵达

1420
02:00:22,445 --> 02:00:24,174
准备撤退
Prepare your men for exfil.

1421
02:00:24,247 --> 02:00:26,738
收到，收到了
Yeah, roger that, sir! Roger that!

1422
02:00:27,483 --> 02:00:31,249
救援车队五分钟后就到
Five minutes! The convoy is going to be here in five minutes!

1423
02:00:51,207 --> 02:00:53,471
我要弹匣，我用完了
I need a mag! Eversmann, I'm out!

1424
02:00:53,643 --> 02:00:54,974
最后一个
My last one!

1425
02:01:00,349 --> 02:01:04,080
（清晨2点05分）

1426
02:01:05,154 --> 02:01:07,315
救援车队来了
The convoy is here!

1427
02:01:25,875 --> 02:01:29,402
艾中士，听说你们要搭便车
Sergeant Eversmann. I heard you guys needed a lift!

1428
02:01:29,645 --> 02:01:31,306
是的，长官
Yes, sir!

1429
02:01:31,514 --> 02:01:34,108
把伤兵抬上来
Bring your wounded and start loading them up!

1430
02:01:41,324 --> 02:01:43,451
我扶你
Hey, I got you. I got you.

1431
02:01:43,659 --> 02:01:46,389
没关系，我想用走的
It's okay. I want to walk.

1432
02:01:46,929 --> 02:01:49,989
我也一样，走吧
Yeah, I would too. Let's go!

1433
02:01:59,175 --> 02:02:00,267
出发
Move!

1434
02:02:03,546 --> 02:02:06,879
找到驾驶尸体就回体育场
We get the pilots' bodies out, and then we go to the stadium.

1435
02:02:07,550 --> 02:02:09,347
车上没有地方了
We're running out of room around here.

1436
02:02:09,418 --> 02:02:11,386
尽量挤一挤
Cram into every possible space.

1437
02:02:12,221 --> 02:02:14,815
第十山地师出动了装甲车
Okay, 10th Mountain provides security for armor, walks us out of the hot zone.

1438
02:02:14,961 --> 02:02:17,215
保护我们从敌区撤退

1439
02:02:17,426 --> 02:02:18,916
第十山地师？
10th Mountain? No.

1440
02:02:19,128 --> 02:02:22,222
我们游骑兵的人可以殿后
Sir, with respect, my Rangers can provide rear security.

1441
02:02:22,398 --> 02:02:26,562
我们走出敌区然后再坐车
We'll walk you out of the hot zone, then we'll jump on the last few vehicles.

1442
02:02:27,570 --> 02:02:28,832
好，出发吧
Okay, let's get out of here.

1443
02:02:28,904 --> 02:02:30,098
走吧
Let's go.

1444
02:02:30,306 --> 02:02:32,797
好了吗？　　　来吧
- All right, you got him? - Yeah, come on.

1445
02:02:34,744 --> 02:02:36,109
来
Come on!

1446
02:02:37,246 --> 02:02:40,238
目标太明显了，快走吧
These things are fucking bullet magnets. Come on, let's go!

1447
02:02:40,316 --> 02:02:42,750
我要接到命令才能走
We go when I'm ordered to, soldier.

1448
02:02:45,621 --> 02:02:46,815
小心点
Careful.

1449
02:02:47,423 --> 02:02:49,618
小心
Easy. Go easy.

1450
02:02:53,029 --> 02:02:54,394
小心
Easy.

1451
02:03:04,907 --> 02:03:07,137
上校，怎么回事？
Colonel, what is going on down there?

1452
02:03:07,209 --> 02:03:10,406
他们绕着尸体拆解驾驶舱
<i>They're dismantling</i> <i>the entire cockpit around the body.</i>

1453
02:03:10,613 --> 02:03:14,276
还要多久？我要你老实说
<i>How long is it going to take?</i> <i>I need an honest, no-shit assessment.</i>

1454
02:03:15,217 --> 02:03:16,582
说不准
They can't say!

1455
02:03:18,554 --> 02:03:19,782
丹尼
Danny...

1456
02:03:21,290 --> 02:03:23,087
绝对不能抛弃同胞
...no one gets left behind.

1457
02:03:23,793 --> 02:03:25,624
你明白吗？
<i>You understand me, son?</i>

1458
02:03:26,095 --> 02:03:27,562
明白
<i>Yes, General.</i>

1459
02:03:28,230 --> 02:03:29,857
你要尽一切可能
Do what you have to do.

1460
02:03:31,233 --> 02:03:32,495
遵命
Roger.

1461
02:03:39,141 --> 02:03:41,371
快点，把他抬出来　　　好了
- Come on. Bring him through. - I got him.

1462
02:03:42,244 --> 02:03:45,307
把伤兵救出来　　　遵命
- Get all his gear. Get the wounded out. - Got you, sir!

1463
02:03:45,515 --> 02:03:50,711
（10月4日，星期一 - 早上5点45分）

1464
02:03:51,020 --> 02:03:52,419
快走　　　好
- Move! - Got you!

1465
02:03:53,089 --> 02:03:55,114
快走
Move out! Move out! Let's go!

1466
02:04:05,201 --> 02:04:06,190
该死
Fuck!

1467
02:04:09,038 --> 02:04:10,369
要爆炸了
Fire in the hole!

1468
02:04:10,573 --> 02:04:12,404
快走　　　走吧
- Let's go! Move! - Let's go!

1469
02:04:22,952 --> 02:04:24,553
快开门，我们要上去
- Open the hatch! We got men back here! - No room here! Go on the roof!

1470
02:04:24,652 --> 02:04:26,353
挤不下了，坐到车顶

1471
02:04:26,422 --> 02:04:27,514
怎么回事？
What's going on?

1472
02:04:27,590 --> 02:04:30,582
车顶？　　　我才不坐车顶
- The roof? - I'm not getting on no fucking roof!

1473
02:04:31,560 --> 02:04:32,959
没地方坐了
No, no, it's full.

1474
02:04:34,396 --> 02:04:37,661
前进吧，用装甲车当掩护
We're running out. Keep moving. Use the vehicles as cover.

1475
02:04:40,069 --> 02:04:42,128
走吧
Move it! Let's go!

1476
02:04:59,054 --> 02:05:01,579
等一下
All right, hold it up. Hold it up.

1477
02:05:03,592 --> 02:05:04,957
出发吧　　　走
- Move! - Go! Move!

1478
02:05:05,194 --> 02:05:06,559
走
Go!

1479
02:06:01,150 --> 02:06:03,584
趴下来
Get down! Get down!

1480
02:06:04,820 --> 02:06:06,082
让开
Get down, lady!

1481
02:06:08,591 --> 02:06:09,956
我没子弹了
I'm out of ammo!

1482
02:06:11,327 --> 02:06:13,318
桑德森，我没子弹了
Sanderson, I'm out of ammo!

1483
02:06:18,334 --> 02:06:19,926
别拿枪
Don't you do it.

1484
02:06:20,536 --> 02:06:23,027
你在干嘛？　　　别开枪
- What are you doing? - Don't you damn do it.

1485
02:06:24,840 --> 02:06:26,205
走吧
Kurth, let's go!

1486
02:08:50,052 --> 02:08:51,542
小心点
Easy.

1487
02:09:41,437 --> 02:09:43,200
可恶
Ah, shit.

1488
02:09:43,272 --> 02:09:46,935
子弹错过你的颈静脉，别动
Bullet missed your jugular by about three millimeters. Don't move.

1489
02:09:48,610 --> 02:09:50,635
快点啦
Hurry up, hurry up.

1490
02:09:54,016 --> 02:09:58,009
咖啡没了，我替你倒了茶
Little short on coffee, but I got you some tea.

1491
02:10:02,291 --> 02:10:03,918
你还好吧？
How you doing, soldier?

1492
02:10:05,127 --> 02:10:06,992
我没有感觉
Can't feel a thing.

1493
02:10:17,072 --> 02:10:18,664
替他量脉搏
Take his pulse.

1494
02:10:52,007 --> 02:10:53,406
中士
Hey, Sarg'nt.

1495
02:10:57,980 --> 02:10:58,969
队长
Captain.

1496
02:10:59,148 --> 02:11:02,140
你还好吧？
Lorenzo. How you doing?

1497
02:11:04,753 --> 02:11:06,588
子弹穿了过去
It went in and out, so the medic said I should be okay in a couple of days.

1498
02:11:06,733 --> 02:11:09,588
医官说我过两天就没事了

1499
02:11:09,758 --> 02:11:11,453
真是好消息
That's great news.

1500
02:11:12,060 --> 02:11:13,755
我们要继续打吗？
Are we going after them?

1501
02:11:13,862 --> 02:11:16,592
当然了，我们要重新整队
You bet your ass we will. We got to regroup.

1502
02:11:18,167 --> 02:11:20,101
别把我留下来
Don't go out there without me.

1503
02:11:21,103 --> 02:11:24,595
别丢下我就回去
Don't go back out there without me.

1504
02:11:25,340 --> 02:11:27,240
我还能打仗
I can still do my job.

1505
02:11:29,011 --> 02:11:31,639
好好休息吧
You get some rest now, okay?

1506
02:11:46,795 --> 02:11:48,194
你要回去？
You're going back in?

1507
02:11:50,299 --> 02:11:52,130
战区还有弟兄
There are still men out there.

1508
02:11:54,536 --> 02:11:56,094
该死
Goddamn.

1509
02:12:01,276 --> 02:12:02,573
我每次回家
When I go home...

1510
02:12:03,579 --> 02:12:05,069
他们都问我
...and people ask me:

1511
02:12:05,247 --> 02:12:08,580
胡特，你为什么从军？
"Hey, Hoot, why do you do it, man?

1512
02:12:09,151 --> 02:12:12,985
难道你是打仗打上瘾吗？
"Why? You some kind of war junkie?"

1513
02:12:13,789 --> 02:12:16,223
我一句话也不说
I won't say a goddamn word.

1514
02:12:16,558 --> 02:12:17,786
为什么？
Why?

1515
02:12:18,427 --> 02:12:20,258
他们不会懂
They won't understand.

1516
02:12:21,997 --> 02:12:24,295
他们不懂我们干嘛打仗
They won't understand why we do it.

1517
02:12:25,801 --> 02:12:29,931
我们是为了同胞弟兄拼命
They won't understand it's about the men next to you.

1518
02:12:31,773 --> 02:12:33,104
就这么简单
And that's it.

1519
02:12:35,277 --> 02:12:36,608
很简单
That's all it is.

1520
02:12:46,955 --> 02:12:51,324
想都别想，我习惯单枪匹马
Don't even think about it, all right? I'm better on my own.

1521
02:12:56,465 --> 02:12:59,457
星期一，又是一周的开始
We started a whole new week. It's Monday.

1522
02:13:12,314 --> 02:13:14,475
贝克朋问我
<i>I was talking to Blackburn the other day...</i>

1523
02:13:14,549 --> 02:13:19,248
什么改变了？我们为什么要回家？
<i>... and he asked me, "What changed?</i> <i>Why are we going home?"</i>

1524
02:13:20,789 --> 02:13:23,121
我说什么都没变
<i>And I said, "Nothing."</i>

1525
02:13:23,325 --> 02:13:27,261
但这不是实话，一切都变了
<i>But that's not true, you know.</i> <i>I think everything's changed.</i>

1526
02:13:28,664 --> 02:13:30,154
我也变了
<i>I know I've changed.</i>

1527
02:13:35,937 --> 02:13:38,633
之前有一个朋友问我
A friend of mine asked me before I got here<i>...</i>

1528
02:13:38,774 --> 02:13:41,038
那是在我们被派来之前
It was when we were all shipping out.

1529
02:13:41,176 --> 02:13:42,666
他问我
He asked me:

1530
02:13:43,945 --> 02:13:46,675
你为什么要去打别人的仗？
"Why are you going to fight somebody else's war?

1531
02:13:47,382 --> 02:13:49,816
你自以为是英雄吗？
"What, do y'all think you're heroes?"

1532
02:13:52,788 --> 02:13:55,188
当时我不知道该说什么
I didn't know what to say at the time...

1533
02:13:58,126 --> 02:14:00,526
现在我的答案是“不”
...but if he asked me again, I'd say no.

1534
02:14:03,098 --> 02:14:05,123
我不想当英雄
I'd say there's no way in hell.

1535
02:14:06,234 --> 02:14:08,259
没有人想当英雄
Nobody asks to be a hero.

1536
02:14:13,608 --> 02:14:15,872
只是有时候时势造英雄
It just sometimes turns out that way.

1537
02:14:19,848 --> 02:14:22,908
我会去找你的父母
I'll talk to your ma and pa when I get home, okay?

1538
02:15:01,823 --> 02:15:03,829
（一千多名索马利亚人死亡）

1539
02:15:03,953 --> 02:15:05,418
（十九名美军阵亡）

1540
02:15:05,495 --> 02:15:10,192
我的爱，你会坚强地活下去
<i>My love, you are strong</i> <i>and you will do well in life.</i>

1541
02:15:11,233 --> 02:15:13,701
我爱你和我的孩子
<i>I love you and my children deeply.</i>

1542
02:15:14,603 --> 02:15:18,095
每一天都会成长茁壮
<i>Today and tomorrow,</i> <i>let each day grow and grow.</i>

1543
02:15:19,307 --> 02:15:23,471
保持笑容，千万别被困境打倒
<i>Keep smiling and never give up,</i> <i>even when things get you down.</i>

1544
02:15:24,780 --> 02:15:27,214
最后，我的爱
<i>So, in closing, my love...</i>

1545
02:15:27,582 --> 02:15:31,416
今晚替我哄我的孩子入睡
<i>... tonight, tuck my children in bed warmly.</i>

1546
02:15:31,853 --> 02:15:36,449
跟他们说我爱他们
<i>Tell them I love them.</i> <i>Then hug them for me...</i>

1547
02:15:36,658 --> 02:15:39,491
替爸爸亲吻他们道晚安
<i>... and give them both</i> <i>a kiss good night for Daddy.</i>

1548
02:15:40,996 --> 02:15:43,055
