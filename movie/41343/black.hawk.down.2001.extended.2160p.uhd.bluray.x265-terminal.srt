1
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:12,770
根据真实事件改编

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:24,250
只有死者才能看到战争终结 ――柏拉图

3
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,350
1992年 东非 索马里

4
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:07,160
多年来的部落战争 造成史无前例的饥荒

5
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,160
三十万人死于饥荒

6
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:21,410
势力最强大的军阀艾迪德 掌控了首都摩加迪沙

7
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,880
他抢走国际组织运送的粮食 以饥荒作为他的武器

8
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,460
他的恶行引起公愤

9
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:46,200
两万名美国海军陆战队员被派到索马里 协助运送粮食并维持治安

10
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,480
1993年4月

11
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,480
艾迪德等到美国海军陆战队一撤退

12
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:05,210
便立刻向其余的联合国维和部队开战

13
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,960
在6月 艾迪德的民兵伏击和屠杀了24名巴基斯坦士兵

14
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,400
并开始攻击美国人

15
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,110
8月底 美军派遣精锐部队

16
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,170
三角洲部队 第75游骑兵团 以及第160特种作战航空团

17
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:35,510
前往摩加迪沙推翻艾迪德 并重建秩序

18
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,020
该任务原定为三个星期便结束

19
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:47,190
但六个星期后 华盛顿失去耐性

20
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:59,680
黑  鹰  坠  落

21
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,440
1993年10月2日 星期六

22
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,450
红十字会粮食分发中心

23
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,520
那里
There.

24
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,790
九点钟方向有武装车
Technicals, nine o'clock.

25
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,050
该死 你看到吗
Oh, shit! Did you see that?

26
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:08,410
机长 在九点钟方向有平民遭到攻击
Chief, we got unarmed civilians getting shot down here at nine o'clock.

27
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,260
看到了 但我们不能干涉
I got it, Matt. I don't think we can touch this.

28
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:19,120
这些粮食是属于穆罕默德・法拉赫・艾迪德的 快滚回家吧

29
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,390
指挥官 这里是超级64号
Command, Super 64...

30
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,270
民兵在粮食分发中心扫射平民
we got militia shooting unarmed civilians down at the food distribution center.

31
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,970
请求准许攻击
Request permission to engage.

32
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,770
超级64号 你有受到攻击吗
Super 64, are you taking fire? Over.

33
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,710
没有 指挥官
Negative, command.

34
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,870
那里属于联合国管辖 我们不能干涉
U.N. 's jurisdiction, 64. We cannot intervene.

35
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,010
- 返回基地 - 收到
- Return to base. Over. - Roger.

36
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,250
64号返回基地
64 returning.

37
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,310
摩加迪沙 巴卡拉市集 艾迪德势力范围

38
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,020
可以走了 奥图先生

39
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,410
他要走了
Leaving.

40
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,390
先生

41
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,730
继续开

42
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,400
我恐怕要迟到

43
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,420
待会儿再打给你

44
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,310
加里森将军
General Garrison?

45
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,940
谢了 我有了
No, no, thanks. I got one.

46
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,350
这是古巴雪茄
But these are Cuban.

47
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,950
上好的保利瓦雪茄
Bolivar Belicoso.

48
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,620
这也是
So is this.

49
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,950
那是迈阿密产的 我的朋友 这没古巴的好
Miami, my friend, is not Cuba.

50
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,640
你们老是抓不到艾迪德
I see not catching Aidid is becoming a routine.

51
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,010
这次我们要抓的不是艾迪德 我们要抓的是你
We weren't trying to catch Aidid. We were trying to catch you.

52
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,100
我
Me?

53
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,440
我有这么重要吗
But am I that important?

54
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,710
我想破头也想不出我有多重要
I hardly think so.

55
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,980
- 你是个生意人 - 只是混口饭吃而已
- You're just a businessman. - Trying to make a living.

56
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,850
对 而且你贩卖枪枝给艾迪德的民兵
Yeah. Selling guns to Aidid's militia.

57
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,520
你来了多久
You've been here, what?

58
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,520
六个星期
Six weeks?

59
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,760
六星期来你一直想抓到他
Six weeks you are trying to catch the general.

60
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,470
到处张帖悬赏海报
You put up reward posters.

61
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,310
两万五千美元 这算什么 你想演《终结追杀令》吗
$25,000. What is this? Gunfight at the K.O. Corral?

62
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,950
是《绝命追杀令》
It's the O.K. Corral.

63
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,820
你以为把我抓来他就会自首
Do you think bringing me in will make him suddenly come to you?

64
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,120
乖乖束手就擒
Make him more agreeable?

65
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,960
你知道他在哪里
You know where he sleeps.

66
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,700
你资助他的一切 包括民兵
You pay for his beds, much less his militia.

67
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,590
我们逮不到他就不会离开索马里
We're not leaving Somalia till we find him.

68
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,860
我们一定会逮到他
And we will find him.

69
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,980
别以为我不是喝自来水长大的…
Don't make the mistake of thinking because I grew up without running water...

70
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,640
就认为我是个笨蛋
I am simple, General.

71
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,010
我对历史很了解
I do know something about history.

72
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:28,440
你看到吗 我们在创造明天
See all this? It's simply shaping tomorrow.

73
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,470
指克林顿总统

74
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:33,980
一个没有阿肯色州白小子干涉我们内政的明天
A tomorrow without a lot of Arkansas white boys' ideas in it.

75
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,320
这点我倒不清楚 我是德州人
Well, I wouldn't know about that. I'm from Texas.

76
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:41,590
加里森将军 你们不该来这儿
Mr. Garrison, I think you shouldn't have come here.

77
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,790
这是内战
This is civil war.

78
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,600
这是我们的战争
This is our war.

79
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,970
不是你们的
Not yours.

80
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,600
三十万人死亡
300,000 dead and counting.

81
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,180
这不是战争 奥图先生 这是种族屠杀
That's not a war, Mr. Atto. That's genocide.

82
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,950
喝茶吧
Now, you enjoy that tea, you hear?

83
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,690
你觉得他怎样
How'd he strike you?

84
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,950
彬彬有礼 冷酷无情
Urbane, sophisticated, cruel.

85
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,790
他是一条大鱼
Yeah, he's a good catch.

86
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,650
时间一久 艾迪德就会感到受制了
It'll take time, but Aidid will feel the loss.

87
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,390
我们没有太多时间
I'm not sure time is something we got in great supply.

88
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:23,170
这里比伊拉克的情形要复杂
This isn't lraq, you know. Much more complicated than that.

89
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,040
但华盛顿官员可不这么想
Boss, most of Washington might disagree.

90
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,170
这个星期他们每天早上都打电话来
I'm just saying they've been calling for these dang situation reports...

91
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,970
要那该死的形势报告
every morning this week.

92
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,750
你就告诉他们说战争一触即发
Well, tell them the situation is fragile.

93
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:42,100
摩加迪沙机场 美国陆军指挥总部

94
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,090
女士们 先生们 先大家好 我是克里夫・"猫王"・渥尔考特

本次航班的机长
I'll be your pilot this afternoon.

96
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,960
这架黑鹰直升机是非吸烟区
Federal regulations has designated the non-smoking Black Hawk helicopter.

97
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,700

you'll be earning 100 free credits this afternoon.

99
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:00,400
呕吐袋就放在前座的椅背
And as always, the air sickness bags are located in the seatback in front of you.

100
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,100
1号发动机正常 克里夫 检查2号发动机
Number one indications are good, Cliff. Put her on two.

101
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,650
没问题
You're still clear.

102
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,190
61号 这里是64号 使用超高频无线电
61, this is 64. Go to UHF secure.

103
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,890
我有个坏消息
I've got some bad news.

104
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,050
Limo为豪华轿车

105
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,530
"Limo"是一个词 杜兰特 别再跟我罗唆
"Limo" is a word, Durant. I don't want to hear about it.

106
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,540
那是缩写 不是一个词
It is not a word. It's an abbreviation of a word.

107
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,600
"Limo"是常用语
"Limo" is a word in common usage.

108
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,670
拼字游戏的规则是接受常用语 我的好朋友
That is the key phrase in Scrabble, my good friend. Common usage.

109
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,580
不 字典查不到就不算
No, if it's not in the dictionary it doesn't count!

110
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,850
字典查不到也算
It doesn't have to be in the dictionary!

111
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,080
字典查不到就不算
It does have to be in the dictionary!

112
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,720
听着 等我回基地我就把这个词给剔除掉
Listen, when we get back to the base, it's coming off the board.

113
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,040
此处Limo指男性器官

114
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,560
你敢碰我的"Limo" 我就揍你 懂吗
You touch my "limo" and I'll spank you, Nightstalker. You hear me?

115
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,190
你有种揍我才怪呢
Yeah, promises.

116
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,870
好美的海滩
That's a nice beach down there.

117
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,700
海水怎样
How's the water?

118
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,670
很暖和 到处都是鲨鱼
Yeah, it's nice and warm. And it's loaded with sharks.

119
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,010
这敢情好
That's great.

120
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,850
- 你觉得这很好玩吗 - 不
- Thinks he's funny. - Yeah. Well, I don't.

121
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,180
听到吗
Hear that?

122
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,390
- 紧张吗 - 我严阵以待
- Nervous? - I'm ready to go, man.

123
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,970
多么适合作战的一天
Beautiful day to fight.

124
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,900
- 名字 - 托迪
- Name. - Todd.

125
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,740
- 姓 - 布莱克博德
- Last name. - Blackburn.

126
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,110
名字是托迪
First name, Todd.

127
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,280
- 这里怎样 - 什么怎样
- So, what's it like? - What's what like?

128
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,750
摩加迪沙 有仗打吗
Mogadishu. The fighting.

129
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,380
- 士兵证号码 - 72163427
- Serial number. - 72163427.

130
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,600
把Mogadishu砍掉一半读成Mog后 就和停尸房Morgue的读音相近了

131
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,690
首先 大家都会说"莫格" 而不会说"摩加迪沙"
Firstly, it's "the Mog" or simply "Mog." No one calls it Mogadishu here.

132
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,060
其次 就是有仗打也没我的份 所以别问我
Secondly, I wouldn't know about the fighting, so don't ask.

133
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,760
为什么
Why not?

134
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,230
我叫你别问了
Didn't I just say, "Don't ask"?

135
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,360
你不是游骑兵
You're not a Ranger.

136
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,670
我当了6年的游骑兵
I am a Ranger. Six years.

137
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,810
我在巴拿马追捕过诺列加 还参加过海湾战争
I was in Panama chasing down Noriega, and in the Gulf.

138
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,370
我可是个老兵 伙计
I'm a vet, my friend.

139
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,640
参加过战斗
In combat?

140
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:22,340
你真像个12岁小孩子 我来解释一下：
Look, kid, you look like you're about 12, so let me explain something to you.

141
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:26,720
我有一种特殊的才能 不必参与战斗
I have a rare and mysterious skill that precludes me from going into missions.

142
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,410
打字
Typing.

143
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,590
- 你会打字吗 - 不会
- Can you type? - No.

144
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:35,290
- 生日 - 1975年2月27日
- Date of birth. - 2-27-75.

145
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,130
我是来踢爆坏人的卵蛋的
Well, I'm here to kick some ass.

146
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,200
回去吧
Let's bring it in.

147
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,960
干得漂亮 伙计
Nice, man! Very smooth!

148
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,390
一枪就打穿发动机了
Single shot through the engine block.

149
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,490
真可惜 那辆吉普车挺帅的
Shit, that's a shame. That was a nice jeep.

150
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,160
停止射击 停止射击
Cease fire! Cease fire!

151
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,740
检查武器

152
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,000
草泥马的"三角洲"
Fucking Delta.

153
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,030
埃利斯曼中士
Sergeant Eversmann.

154
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,910
- 中士 - 什么事
- Sergeant. - Yeah?

155
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,880
我是一等兵布莱克博德
Private First Class Blackburn.

156
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,100
什么事
Yeah?

157
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,870
我来报到
Reporting for duty.

158
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,130
你应该向比尔斯中尉报到
Not to me you're not. You're reporting to Lt. Beales.

159
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,380
他应该就在附近
He should be around here somewhere.

160
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,250
我把他交给你了
Can I leave him with you?

161
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,190
好吧
Yeah, go ahead.

162
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,280
- 你带武器了吗 - 带了 长官
- You brought your weapon. - Yes, sir.

163
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,260
我不累 我能练靶吗
Want me to shoot? I'm rested.

164
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,500
- 什么时候到的 - 刚到
- When did you get in? - Just now, Sarg'nt.

165
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,320
先做重要的事
First things first.

166
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,570
这会是你在非洲最好的朋友
This will be your best friend in all of Africa.

167
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,330
它叫"牛蛙"
It's called BullFrog.

168
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,840
抹一点到脸上
Get some on over here, all right?

169
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,210
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

170
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,240
嘿 施密德 帮我带一下队
Hey, Schmid! Take over for me, would you?

171
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,780
好了 先去把东西放好
All right. Let's get you unpacked.

172
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,890
谁饿了
Hey, who's hungry?

173
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,470
这算什么 纳税人出钱组织的三角洲野餐队吗
What is this, Sarg'nt? Another taxpayer-funded Delta safari?

174
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:14,050
Jeff Sanderson为电影中化名 这位三级军士长真名叫Paul Howe 退役后开了自己的战术培训学校

175
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,310
- 如果加里森将军问起可别说 - 我问起呢
- Not if General Garrison is asking. - I'm asking.

176
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,180
用餐愉快 上尉
Have a nice meal, Captain.

177
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,190
- 嘿 伙计 大家都在排队 - 我知道
- Hey, man, there's a line. - I know.

178
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,430
- 你这是插队 - 我也知道
- Well, this isn't the back of it. - Yeah, I know.

179
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,500
军士 军士
Sergeant. Sergeant.

180
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,470
这是怎么回事
What's going on here?

181
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,510
我们练靶的时候打到了一只野猪
Some aerial target practice, sir. Didn't want to leave it behind.

182
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,510
我是说你的武器
I'm talking about your weapon.

183
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,760
hot weapon指武器上了膛同时又打开了保险

184
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,240
三角洲也不能拿一把开着保险的枪到处乱晃
Now, Delta or no Delta, that's a hot weapon.

185
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,980
你应该很清楚 在基地里 任何时候枪都要关着保险
You know better than that. Safety should be on at all times on base.

186
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
这一段是编导在瞎掰 现实中D-BOYS都是非常注意保险的
比如Sanderson的原型Paul Howe在他的经验里都十分强调保险的作用

187
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:44,020
这就是我的"保险"
Well, this is my safety, sir.

188
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,180
别管他 他好几天没吃饭了
Let it go, sir. The guy hasn't eaten in a couple of days.

189
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,420
你那帮三角小崽子只是一群目无纪律的牛仔
You Delta boys are a bunch of undisciplined cowboys.

190
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,690
我告诉你
Let me tell you something, Sarg'nt.

191
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,530
到了前线 你会需要游骑兵的支援的
When we get on the five-yard line, you're going to need my Rangers.

192
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,260
你们最好学学什么是团队精神
So y'all better learn to be team players.

193
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,840
我说完了
We're done here.

194
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,810
说呀 你说这是保险
Speak up. You say this is your safety?

195
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,080
这是我的靴子
Well, this is my boot, son.

196
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:24,460
小心我用这只靴子把你踢爆
And it will fit up your asses with the proper amount of force.

197
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:28,090
- 这是新泽西口音吗 - 拜托 我很努力耶
- Is that a Jersey accent? - I'm trying to do this, give me a break.

198
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,360
把太阳眼镜脱掉
Take those sunglasses off, soldier.

199
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,870
"三角洲"喜欢戴Ｏ记眼镜 那是他们的事
Delta wants to wear Oakleys, that's their business.

200
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,630
别让我再看到你戴
I don't want to see them on you again. Hoo-ah?

201
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,430
这把枪上了膛
Is that a hot weapon?

202
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,340
你下了吗
Is that your move?

203
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,380
手还没离棋啊
Is my hand on the piece?

204
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,840
再下三步我就赢了
I can mate you in three whatever you do.

205
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:55,180
你自己小心点吧 我正盯着你的"女王"呢
I'd keep my eye on that queen before counseling with the others.

206
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,560
她躺在那儿等着呢
Well, she's just lying in wait.

207
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,100
进退维谷吧 戈登
Stranded and condemned, Gordy.

208
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,320
该你了
Your move.

209
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,670
克里布斯
Cribbs.

210
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,740
伊格斯
Yikes.

211
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,570
你画得越来越好了
It's good. You're really improving.

212
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:16,240
不过我有一个建议
If I may make a suggestion... Observation.

213
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,400
说吧
Go ahead.

214
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,810
- 这是童话故事 对吧 - 没错
- It's a children's book, right? - Right.

215
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:24,580
这会把小孩子吓得屁滚尿流
They are not supposed to scare the living shit out of the children.

216
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,000
这里说到我们的的骑士…
This is the part of the story where our knight, our warrior...

217
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,500
正要屠掉独眼巨龙
is about to slay the one-eyed dragon.

218
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,220
本来就很可怕 而且我女儿最喜欢了
That's scary. Besides, my daughter loves this stuff.

219
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,490
我以为你上礼拜就画完了
Thought you finished that last week.

220
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,190
你说完了吗
You done?

221
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,330
就快冲到十码线了
Hey, we are at the 10-yard line here, men.

222
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,890
明白吗
You understand?

223
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,550
讥讽美式足球运动员的智商

224
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,970
你会数数吗 一 二 十
Can you count? One, two, ten.

225
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,950
美式足球里持球跑动进攻的球员

226
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,440
我的跑卫呢
Okay? Where are my running backs?

227
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,410
我的跑卫哪去了
Where are my running backs?

228
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:54,070
我没看到你做礼拜
Hey, I didn't see you at church on Sunday, soldier.

229
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,340
你有别的事吗
You had something more important to do?

230
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,910
礼拜天一定要做礼拜
Not on Sunday, you don't. Not anymore.

231
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,390
别给我落跑 了解吗
I will make you believe, you understand?

232
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,000
很好笑
Pretty funny, hoo-ah?

233
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,940
你学得很像 很像我
It was a good impression. I recognize myself.

234
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,520
你们继续吧
All right, carry on.

235
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:32,420
- 我要跟你讲话 - 是 长官
- I'd like a word, specialist. - Sir.

236
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,410
你知道谁有指挥权吧
Tell me, Pilla, you understand why we have a chain of command, don't you?

237
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,650
知道 长官
Roger that, sir.

238
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,530
你敢再取笑我…
'Cause if I ever see you undermine me again...

239
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,440
我就要你把马桶舔干净
you'll be cleaning latrines with your tongue...

240
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,100
保证你一个月吃不下饭
till you can't taste the difference between shit and French fries.

241
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,530
- 明白吗 - 明白了
- Are we clear? - Hoo-ah, sir.

242
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
好了
All right.

243
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,640
听好
Listen to this:

244
00:18:55,710 --> 00:19:00,480
当一个索马里人杀了人 他的部落就欠对方部落一百只骆驼
If one skinny kills another skinny, his clan owes the dead guy's clan a hundred camels.

245
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,010
一百只骆驼
A hundred camels.

246
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,610
我连一只都不给
Camels. I wouldn't pay one camel.

247
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,950
这儿的人一定都欠了一屁股的骆驼债
Must be a lot of fucking camel debt.

248
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:09,480
这是真的吗
Is that really true, Lieutenant?

249
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,960
去问埃利斯曼中士 他喜欢非洲人
Ask Sgt. Eversmann. He likes the skinnies.

250
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,660
埃利斯曼中士 那是真的吗?
Sgt. Eversmann, you really like the skinnies?

251
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:19,200
不是喜欢不喜欢的问题 我尊重他们
It's not that I like them or I don't like them. I respect them.

252
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:23,730
你们意识到埃利斯曼中士是个理想主义者了吧
See, what you guys fail to realize is the sergeant is a bit of an idealist.

253
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:27,370
他相信这项任务的使命对吧 中士
He believes in this mission down to his very bones. Don't you, Sergeant?

254
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,710
这些人没有工作
Look, these people, they have no jobs...

255
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:35,070
没有食物 教育和未来
no food, no education, no future.

256
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:38,710
我只是觉得我们有两个选择
I just figure that, I mean, we have two things that we can do.

257
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,080
帮助他们
We can either help...

258
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,590
或是眼睁睁看着他们自相残杀
or we can sit back and watch the country destroy itself on CNN.

259
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:44,890
对吧
Right?

260
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:48,490
我不知道 我是来打仗的
I don't know about you guys, but I was trained to fight.

261
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,460
你不是吗
Are you trained to fight, Sergeant?

262
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:53,660
我是来改善世界的
Well, I think I was trained to make a difference, Kurth.

263
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,990
他真的很有理想
Like the man said, he's an idealist.

264
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,770
等等 我最爱这一段
Oh, wait. This is my favorite part.

265
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,110
滚远一点
Stay away from the cans!

266
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,380
去死吧 猪头
Die, gas-pumper!

267
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,180
给我滚远一点
Stay away from those cans!

268
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,420
比尔斯
Beales!

269
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,080
不 退后
No, no, stay back, stay back.

270
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,150
他的癫痫症发作了 拿东西让他咬着
He's having a seizure. Put something in his mouth.

271
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:27,960
约翰 没事了…没事了
John, it's okay. John, it's okay. It's okay.

272
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:37,220
10月3日 星期天 清晨5:45

273
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,850
他没事了 不过他得退伍
Well, he'll be fine. But not in this army.

274
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,320
他有癫痫症 我得送他回家
He's out of the game. He's epileptic, going home.

275
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:29,380
按照马克・鲍顿原著里的解释 Chalk为游骑兵的一个12人战斗小分队
但根据美国陆军作战条令 Chalk为"黑鹰"在空中突击中运载的一个11人小分队

276
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,030
我要你来带领他的小分队
I'm putting you in charge of his chalk.

277
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,600
- 有什么问题吗 - 没有 长官
- You got a problem with that? - No, sir.

278
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,760
这个责任很重大
Now, it's a big responsibility.

279
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,110
你的弟兄们依赖你
Your men are gonna look to you to make the right decisions.

280
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,830
他们的命都在你手上
Their lives depend on it.

281
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,570
好了
All right.

282
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,500
"Rangers, lead the way" 乃游骑兵口号

283
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,010
- 游骑兵 做先锋 - 勇往直前
- Rangers lead the way, sir. - All the way.

284
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,170
祝好运
Good luck, Sergeant.

285
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:53,300
巴卡拉市集 哈瓦迪街 艾迪德民兵的据点

286
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:34,430
艾迪德势力的高级成员今天下午三点可能要开会
A long anticipated meeting of Aidid's senior cabinet may take place today at 1500 hours.

287
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,230
我说"可能"是因为…
I say "may" because we all know by now...

288
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,390
根据目前的情报 一切都不确定
with the intel we get on the street, nothing is certain.

289
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:44,500
这是三方确定的情报
This is actual intel confirmed by three sources.

290
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:48,570
两名高层成员可能会在场
Two tier-one personalities may be present:

291
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,780
艾迪德的政治顾问奥玛・萨拉德
Omar Salad, Aidid's top political advisor...

292
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:55,440
内政部长阿迪・哈桑・阿瓦利
and Abdi Hassan Awale, lnterior Minister.

293
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,540
他们是我们的目标
These are the guys we're after.

294
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,790
今天就行动
Today we go.

295
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,350
任务计划和以前一样
Same mission template as before.

296
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:07,290
15:45时 三角洲的突击小组攻入敌方建筑物
1545, Assault Force Delta will infiltrate the target building...

297
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,590
逮捕里面所有的嫌疑人
and seize all suspects within.

298
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:14,030
警戒部队为游骑兵的四个小分队 由斯蒂尔上尉指挥
Security Force Rangers: 4 Ranger chalks, under the command of Captain Steele...

299
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,200
在15:46时滑降到地面
will rope in at 1546...

300
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:19,640
在目标建筑外围的四个角建立防线
and hold a four-corner perimeter around the target building.

301
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,630
任何人不得进出
No one gets in or out.

302
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,230
撤退部队
Extraction Force:

303
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:28,450
麦肯奈特中校的悍马车队在15:47时开进哈瓦迪街
Lt. Colonel McKnight's humvee column will drive into the city at 1547...

304
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,350
停在奥林匹克旅馆前
on Hawlwadig Road and hold just short of the Olympic Hotel here.

305
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,010
等待指示
Wait for the green light.

306
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:36,110
当三角洲部队突击成功
Now once Delta gives the word...

307
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:38,720
麦肯奈特的手下前往目标建筑
McKnight's column will move to the target building...

308
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,230
把犯人架上车
and load the prisoners on flatbed trucks.

309
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,000
把犯人架上车后
Immediately after the prisoners are loaded...

310
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:48,160
游骑兵的四个小分队立即到目标大楼集合
the four Ranger chalks will collapse back to the target building...

311
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,030
一起上悍马车队
load up on humvees...

312
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:53,970
然后地面部队就一路返回基地
and the entire ground force will exfil the 3 miles back to base.

313
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,810
行动时间预计不足30分钟
Mission time from incursion to extraction, no longer than 30 minutes.

314
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:03,520
我原本请求调动装甲车辆和AC-130"幽灵"炮艇机支援
Now, I had requested light armor and AC-130 Spectre gunships...

315
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:07,250
但华盛顿却不同意
but Washington, in all its wisdom, decided against this.

316
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,750
他们认为太高调了
Too high-profile.

317
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:13,090
所以行动将由"黑鹰"和"小鸟"
So Black Hawks and Little Birds will provide the air cover...

318
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,360
用Minigun和2.75英寸火箭提供空中支援
with miniguns and 2.75 rockets.

319
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,930
哈勒尔上校
Colonel Harrell.

320
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:21,450
C-2即"指挥"Commando和"控制"Control

321
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:21,890
在C-2直升机上 马修斯上校负责空中支援的调度
In the C-2 bird, Colonel Matthews will coordinate the air mission...

322
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:25,000
而我负责指挥地面部队
and I will coordinate ground forces.

323
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,540
马修斯上校
Colonel Matthews.

324
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,910
本次任务的代号为"艾琳"
Mission launch code word is lrene.

325
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,640
有问题吗
Questions?

326
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,350
目标是哪栋建筑
Which building is it, sir?

327
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,420
目前还不清楚准确的目标建筑
Exactly which building, we're confirming right now.

328
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,820
只知道是巴卡拉市集附近
Somewhere around the Bakara Market.

329
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,720
我不能替他们决定开会的时间地点
I don't choose the time or place of their meetings.

330
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,690
我不是这个意思
I didn't say a word, sir.

331
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,530
大家听好 你们到了巴卡拉市集
Make no mistake, once you're in the Bakara Market...

332
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,000
就等于进入战区
you're in an entirely hostile district.

333
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:57,090
千万别低估敌人实力
Don't underestimate their capabilities.

334
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:00,840
进入市集之前都不是战区
Now we'll be going through friendly neighborhoods before we hit the market...

335
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:05,110
千万切记交战规则 遭到攻击后才能还击
so remember the rules of engagement: No one fires unless fired upon.

336
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,880
完成这件任务吧
Now, let's go get this thing done.

337
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,610
祝大家好运
Good luck, gentlemen.

338
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,490
还有什么不满吗 丹尼
What's the matter, Danny? Something you don't like?

339
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:21,060
没有"幽灵"炮艇机 而且是白天的行动…
No Spectre gunships, daylight instead of night...

340
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,830
那些索马里佬在下午特别精神
late afternoon when they're all fucked up on khat...

341
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:28,430
而那里又是艾迪德的根据地 火力集中
only part of the city Aidid can mount a serious counter-attack on short notice...

342
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,130
- 我还能什么不满的 - 人生不如意事十常八九
- What's not to like? - Life's imperfect.

343
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:34,940
你们在半空中只是不如意
Yeah. For you two, circling above it at 500 feet, it's imperfect.

344
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,540
我们在地面就苦不堪言
Down in the street, it's unforgiving.

345
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,950
那时候除了打个招呼你们还能帮我什么
You two say hello to me from up there.

346
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,440
你死不了
You'll do fine.

347
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,620
谢谢
Thanks.

348
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,680
要搞什么
What the fuck, Smith?

349
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,120
什么
Well? Well, what?

350
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:26,790
我们要出动了吗
We going?

351
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,820
- 我干嘛告诉你 - 因为我想知道
- Why should I tell you that? - Because I'm me.

352
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,600
好吧 下午三点 市中心
Yeah. 3:00. Downtown.

353
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,070
- 巴卡拉市集 - 好吧
- Bakara Market. - All right.

354
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:42,970
听着 史密斯 我要你全力支持我
Listen, Smith, I need you to back me up out there today, all right?

355
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,370
提高警觉
Keep sharp.

356
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,180
遵命 埃利斯曼中士
Yes, sir, Sergeant Eversmann.

357
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,750
这次行动是小意思啦
Ev, it's going to be nothing, man.

358
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,680
小意思
Nothing.

359
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,620
嘿
Hey.

360
00:26:58,690 --> 00:26:59,960
坐下
Sit down.

361
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,870
这是怎么回事
How'd this happen?

362
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,500
我不太愿意想起来
I don't even remember.

363
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:13,700
觉得自己就像个傻瓜 玩乒乓球的时候
Think I was just goofing off. Playing ping-pong, I think.

364
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,740
撞到混凝土台角上了
Sort of hit the concrete.

365
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,050
好吧
Okay.

366
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:22,850
你可以把它治好吗 我们今天要出动
You can fix it up though. We're going out today.

367
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,190
你哪也去不了
You're not going anywhere.

368
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,810
可恶
Jesus Christ!

369
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:36,130
磨咖啡豆的关键是不能磨得太细或太粗
It's all in the grind, Sizemore. Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.

370
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,260
这是一种技巧
This, my friend, is a science.

371
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,860
我可是相信征兵广告的
I mean, you're looking at the guy that believed the commercials.

372
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,820
美国征兵广告的口号：Be all you can be

373
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,300
你看 "去做你力所能及的事"嘛
You know, about "be all you can be."

374
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:48,370
结果我在整个"海湾风暴"期间都在煮咖啡
I made coffee through Desert Storm.

375
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:53,710
在巴拿马也是煮咖啡 而别的游骑兵都在打仗
I made coffee through Panama, while everyone else got to fight got to be a Ranger.

376
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:59,180
我却只能煮黑咖啡 替别人拿奶精
Now it's "Grimesy, black, one sugar" or "Grimesy, got a powdered anywhere?"

377
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,920
- 怎么回事 - 打乒乓球受伤了
- What happened to you? - Ping-Pong accident.

378
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,190
什么
What?

379
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:09,690
你猜怎么着
So guess what.

380
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,170
你的愿望实现了 你今天要出动了
Your wish has been granted. You're going out today.

381
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,760
少唬我了
You're fucking me.

382
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,660
你要接替我的位置 操纵M60机枪
You're taking my place assisting the 60 gunner.

383
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,830
埃利斯曼中士叫你快去收拾好装备
Sergeant Eversmann said to get your stuff and get ready.

384
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,180
你想要打仗 不是吗
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

385
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,580
是啊
Oh, yeah.

386
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,470
是啊
Hell, yeah.

387
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:32,210
格里姆斯 紧跟着瓦戴尔 你是他的弹药手
Grimesy, I want you to stick with Waddell and give him ammo when he needs it.

388
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:38,180
别担心 索马里人的枪法都很烂
I wouldn't worry about that. Generally speaking, Somalis can't shoot for shit.

389
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:39,290
别担心
Don't worry about it.

390
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,450
小心别被他们的石头扔到就行
Just watch out for the sammys throwing the rocks, and you'll be fine.

391
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,660
会很好玩的
Might even be fun.

392
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:47,760
让"三角洲"打头阵 我们只是支援他们
D-boys do their thing now. All we got to do is cover them.

393
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,960
直升机也会掩护我们的
Choppers going to cover us, and we'll be all right.

394
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:55,340
我知道我是第一次当分队长
Look, you guys, I know this is my first time as chalk leader...

395
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,980
但我们不是第一次出任务
but, this isn't our first time out together. This is serious.

396
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,440
我们是游骑兵 不是什么狗屁预备役军官
We're Rangers, not some sorry-ass JROTC.

397
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,410
我们是精锐的
We're elite.

398
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:07,250
大家要好好表现
Let's act like it out there.

399
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,010
有其他问题吗
Any questions?

400
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,230
我们会完满完成的
We're going to be okay.

401
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,160
去收拾装备 行动吧
All right, grab your gear. Let's move out.

402
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:53,230
不必带水壶 很快就会回来了
You're not going to need that, dude. We're not out there long enough.

403
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,600
也用不着带那个
You're not gonna need that, either.

404
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,510
天黑前就会回来
We'll be back before dark.

405
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,140
你还不如多带些大麻和啤酒
You might as well take dope and beer instead.

406
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,410
什么
What?

407
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,780
弹药啦 我是说多带些弹药啦
Ammo, dude. Take ammo.

408
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:22,660
我告诉你吧 格里姆斯 你身上已经背着五十磅的装备了
Let me tell you something, Grimes. You got about 50 pounds of gear as it is.

409
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,160
没必要再增加额外的十二磅
You don't need another 12.

410
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:28,570
我不知道你有什么打算 反正我是不会被人在背后打枪的
I don't know about you, but I don't plan on getting shot in the back running away.

411
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,260
好吧 我也会注意的
Well, I better keep mine in.

412
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,500
格里姆斯
Hey, Grimes.

413
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,270
最重要的是
The most important thing:

414
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,240
朝着大家射击的方向开枪
Just remember, when everybody else is shooting, shoot in the same direction.

415
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,370
好
All right.

416
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:48,850
你瞧 他在靴子帖上血型
Look at this. He's taping his blood type to his boots.

417
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,090
- 这要触霉头的 - 不 他很聪明
- That's bad luck. - No, it's smart.

418
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,390
"三角洲"都这么做
All Delta do that.

419
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,390
写遗书也是触霉头的
That's bad luck, too, man.

420
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:59,370
快走吧
Come on, let's go.

421
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,330
幸好你不是左撇子 阿多尼斯
It's a good thing you're right-handed, Adonis.

422
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:11,540
- 不然你就打不了飞机啦 - 你真会说笑
- If not, I don't know what you'd do. - You're a funny guy, man.

423
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:16,280
- 我不替你拿遗书 - 咱们可是说好的
- I'm not taking no death letter. - We have a deal.

424
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:21,180
回来后再还给你
I'll give it to you back in an hour.

425
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,160
- 布莱克博德 感觉怎样 - 很兴奋
- Blackburn, you okay? - Excited.

426
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:30,520
这是好事 我命中注定就是当兵打仗的料
In a good way. I've been training my whole life for this.

427
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:32,890
你开枪打过人吗
You ever shot at anybody before?

428
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,470
没有
No, sir.

429
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,230
我也没
Me neither.

430
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,290
下午2:29

431
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,010
他靠得住吗
Think he's reliable?

432
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:16,600
瞧着吧 这是他第一次出任务
Well, we'll see. It's his first time out.

433
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:18,420
联合作战指挥中心

434
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:27,180
- 叫他把收音机关掉 - 是 长官
- Tell him to turn his damn radio off. - Yes, sir.

435
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,950
叫他把收音机关掉
Tell him to turn his radio off.

436
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:32,020
阿迪 关掉收音机
Abdi, you need to turn your radio off.

437
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:42,560

你最好别睡着了
You'd better not be sleeping.

443

00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:29,210
- 对不起 我没看到你在后面 - 没关系
- Sorry, I didn't see you there. - It's all right.

449
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,830
这有点好笑
You know, it's kind of funny.

450
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,030
这里蓝天白云 椰林树影 水清沙幼
Beautiful beach, beautiful sun.

451
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,900
几乎是个度假的好地方
Could almost be a good place to visit.

452
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,170
几乎是
Almost.

453
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,240
你认为我们不该来
You don't think we should be here.

454
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:04,610
你知道我怎么想吗 我怎么想并不重要
You know what I think? It don't really matter what I think.

455
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:10,260
当第一颗子弹从你头顶上呼啸而过时…
Once that first bullet goes past your head, politics and all that shit...

456
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,550
就什么屁事都不重要了
just goes right out the window.

457
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,250
我只想着完成任务
I just want to do it right today.

458
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,090
打起精神来 让弟兄们活着回来
Just watch your corner. Get all your men back here alive.

459
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:49,090
就是这儿了 还是汽车抛锚了
Now, is this supposed to be the place, or did his car just take a dump?

460
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,600
阿迪 请回答
Abdi, come in.

461
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,690
你听到吗 这里就是目标吗
Abdi, can you hear me? Is this the place?

462
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,170
阿迪
Abdi, come in.

463
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,680
听到吗
Can you hear me? Abdi.

464
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,770
请回答 是这里吗
Abdi, come in. Is this the place?

465
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:13,550
我右手边 咖啡厅楼上
To my right hand side, above the cafe.

466
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,250
他说就是这里
Sir, he says this is the building.

467
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,760
他确定
He's certain?

468
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,350
阿迪 你要确定才行
Abdi, you need to be sure.

469
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,900
你确定
Are you sure?

470
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,800
目标在我左边两条街口外
Well, it's down the road, two blocks over on my left.

471
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,770
不过民兵太多了
But there's too many militia.

472
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,370
我一靠近他们就会开枪
If I go closer, they might shoot me.

473
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:37,170
他说目标在两个街口外
Now he's saying the building's actually a couple blocks down...

474
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,940
但他担心太靠近的话会被人开枪
but if he's seen outside it, he'll be shot.

475
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,810
他不敢靠近的话我会亲手向他开枪
I'll fucking shoot him myself a couple blocks down.

476
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,410
叫他把车子停在目标建筑门口
Tell him I want his skinny ass parked in front of the damn building.

477
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:49,180
他不去就拿不到钱
He's not getting paid till he does exactly that.

478
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,950
离目标区域三英里 不要走小路
It's three miles to the target area. We're never off the main roads.

479
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:56,220
到了K4交通圆环后先向北然后往东
At the K-four traffic circle, we turn north, then east on National...

480
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,490
在那儿等候劫出犯人
and we wait until extraction of prisoners is complete here.

481
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,540
然后全队开进
Then we roll up in force on Hawlwadig...

482
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,370
载上犯人和地面部队
we load the prisoners, and then the assault-blocking forces...

483
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,800
把他们一起带回来
and bring them back.

484
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:08,030
一小时内就可以返回基地
Home in an hour. Okay?

485
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,250
指19世纪时期子弹横飞的美国西部

486
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,770
敌人肯定会反击 到时巴卡拉市集就会像狂野西部一样
Now there will be some shooting. Bakara Market is the Wild West.

487
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:15,280
但你们开枪要小心 那儿有平民
But be careful what you shoot at because people do live there.

488
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:33,290
上一个线民在酒吧里玩俄罗斯轮盘 结果把自己脑袋给嘣掉了
Last one of these guys shot himself in the head playing Russian roulette in a bar.

489
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,710
长官 他停车了
Sir, the vehicle is stopped.

490
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,980
这次是真正的目标吗 他确定吗
So this is the real deal now. He's sure this time?

491
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:58,180
- 他的声音听起来已经是吓得屁滚尿流了 - 好了 看来这次是对的了
- He sounds scared shitless. - Good. That's always a good sign.

492
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,870
对头 他发出暗号了
That's it. That's our signal.

493
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,270
行动吧
All right.

494
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,750
QRF是快速反应部队的缩写

决不抛弃同袍
No one gets left behind.

506
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,400
怎么回事
What's wrong?

507
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,440
以前他从不跟我们道别的
Nothing. He's just never done that before.

508
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,440
该死的
Aw, fuck!

509
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,210

Okay, 56, looks like there's some friendlies on the ground.

我不能再回去
I can't go back out there.

942
01:21:11,770 --> 01:21:16,230
托马斯 大家都跟你一样害怕
Thomas, everyone feels the same way you do. All right?

943
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:19,570
所以你现在的表现才显得重要
It's what you do right now that makes a difference.

944
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:21,840
你自己决定吧
It's your call.

945
01:21:47,310 --> 01:21:50,430
最好把悍马车上的血迹冲掉
It'll probably help to wash the blood out of the humvees.

975
01:25:00,370 --> 01:25:02,630

No, I didn't bring it, and you want to know why?

976
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:05,980
因为你说过 我们半小时就回来了 用不着那玩意儿
Because you said: "You're not gonna need that, dude, we'll be back in a half-hour."

977
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:07,600
我不是这样跟你说的
No, I wasn't saying it to you.

978
01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:09,660
尼尔森 掩护这条路

985
01:25:26,690 --> 01:25:28,220
出发吧
Let's move out.

Ground forces have occupied several buildings along Marehan Road...

987
01:25:40,940 --> 01:25:42,630
但是都分散开来

他们的情况很惨
They're banged up pretty bad.

吸引他们的火力

将军 人群增加到好几百人

他们很清楚自己的要求有多危险
They know what they're asking.

1015

我们要求到坠机地点建立防线并等待地面支援
We're asking to go in and set up a perimeter until ground support arrives.

你得清楚我无法告诉你要等多久 支援部队恐怕得花上好一阵子
And you realize that I cannot tell you when that might be, it could take a while.

1021

- But I'm shot, Colonel. - Everybody's shot.

我们得把犯人押回去
We need the prisoners! Let's go!

侦察机说你先开到哈瓦迪街再直走
Surveillance says to take Hawlwadig, then go straight.

The perimeter has to be tighter for the convoy.

1073
01:32:29,110 --> 01:32:31,010
你们离坠机地点还太远
You're too far from the crash.

1074
01:32:31,220 --> 01:32:34,650
散开行动 自己突围
Stay spread out like that and you're all liable to be overrun.

1075
01:32:34,850 --> 01:32:37,620
好吧 停车 马多克斯 停车
All right, stop, stop, Maddox. Stop.

1076
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,420
那婊子养的
Son of a bitch.

1077
01:32:40,530 --> 01:32:43,390
R64号 我们又回到原点了
Romeo 64, we're right back where we started.

1078
01:32:43,630 --> 01:32:46,460
弹药快用完了 而且大家都受了伤
I'm running low on ammo, I got many wounded including me...

1079
01:32:46,530 --> 01:32:48,360
车子也几乎跑不起了
vehicles that are barely running.

1080
01:32:48,430 --> 01:32:51,730
好吧 丹尼 你就实说吧
Okay, Danny, I need a no-b.s. assessment here.

1081
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:53,930
你能到达坠机地点吗
Can you get to the crash site?

1082
01:32:54,810 --> 01:32:57,070
上校 我什么也看不到
Colonel, I can't see shit.

1083
01:33:01,210 --> 01:33:02,240
不能
Negative.

1084
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:05,180
伤员太多 我们去了也没用
With the amount of wounded we have, we'd do more harm than good.

1085
01:33:05,250 --> 01:33:09,410
我们要回基地补充弹药然后再回来
We need to come back to base, rearm and regroup and then we can go back out.

1086
01:33:09,490 --> 01:33:10,490
明白
Roger.

1087
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:15,760
C-2 叫他们回来 带他们离开那儿
C-2, bring them back. Get them out of there.

1088
01:33:17,230 --> 01:33:18,820
明白 返回基地吧
Roger. Return to base.

1089
01:33:19,530 --> 01:33:20,900
我们要回去了
We're going home!

1090
01:33:21,130 --> 01:33:22,760
走吧 左转
Let's go. Left.

1091
01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:35,810
下午4:54

1092
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:39,210
收到了 明白 车队要返回基地
Roger that. Understand. Convoy returning to base.

1093
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:46,550
- 怎么回事 - 车队被叫回去了
- What's up? - They're sending them back.

1094
01:33:46,620 --> 01:33:48,390
车队要回基地
The convoy's headed back to base camp.

1095
01:33:48,460 --> 01:33:50,620
这可太妙了
Oh, now that makes sense, don't it?

1096
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:55,230
我们要赶紧把伤员送回去 然后才来这儿
We need to exfil the wounded now and get the hell out of here before it's too late!

1097
01:33:55,300 --> 01:33:58,830
麦肯奈特中校先回基地是有理由的
If Colonel McKnight went back to base, then he had a good reason.

1098
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:00,670
我们的任务不变
It changes nothing.

1099
01:34:00,740 --> 01:34:01,830
大伙儿听好
All right, listen up.

1100
01:34:01,910 --> 01:34:04,830
我们要顶住防线 要守住这个据点
We're going to hold the perimeter and we're going to hold the strongpoint.

1101
01:34:07,110 --> 01:34:09,940
节约弹药 有必要才开枪
Conserve your ammo. Only shoot at what you can hit.

1102
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:13,980
车队一定会回来的
The convoy is going to come.

1103
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:16,720
我们一定能回家
We're going to get home.

1104
01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:29,870
装弹

兰迪 我要手枪弹匣

1107
01:34:55,390 --> 01:34:56,490

1108
01:35:00,130 --> 01:35:01,530

1110
01:35:09,810 --> 01:35:10,900
操
Fuck!

1111
01:35:24,290 --> 01:35:26,480
戈登死了 我出去拼了
Gordy is gone, man. I'll be outside.

1112
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:28,180
祝你好运
Good luck.

1113
01:35:55,650 --> 01:35:58,520
我们需要第十山地师的帮助 他们在这里有什么就要什么
We need the 10th Mountain in there. Everything they got.

1114

还有巴基斯坦和马来西亚 我需要他们的坦克和装甲人员输送车
Pakistanis, Malays, I want their tanks and APCs.

1115
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:03,750
他们不知道我们的行动
They don't know we've gone in.

1116
01:36:03,830 --> 01:36:08,270
瞧 我们捅了马蜂窝 这里 我们是在跟整个城市作战
Look, we have stirred up the hornet's nest here. We're fighting the entire city.

1117
01:36:08,670 --> 01:36:13,330
我需要所有的车辆 不管是装甲车还是什么 快去要回来 有什么要什么
I want every vehicle possible that's got 4 wheels and armor. Get it. Get everything.

1118
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:16,840
一旦把部队集结起来 就去把我们的人救出敌对地区
Now, once they've assembled, we're gonna move our men out of the hostile area...

1119
01:36:16,910 --> 01:36:19,500
送到位于安全区内的巴基斯坦体育场
and back to the Pakistani Stadium, the safe zone.

1120
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:21,980
- 马上执行 - 遵命 长官
- Now, let's go. - Roger that, boss.

1121
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:38,410
穆罕默德・艾迪德

1122
01:38:39,390 --> 01:38:40,720
要活捉…

1123
01:38:41,690 --> 01:38:43,020
这名战俘

1124
01:38:58,340 --> 01:39:01,400
跪下 跪下
On your knees! Get down! Get down!

1125

Roger. I can see it, but I can't get there. Over.

不行 你不明白
Negative. You don't understand.

1130
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:31,890
前面路障连着路障 你得另找一条路
It's roadblock after roadblock. You have to find us another route. Over.

1131
01:39:32,270 --> 01:39:35,900
另一条路要绕过整座城市
There ain't one. The only other route is all the way around the city.

01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:30,920
按住 要马上救治才行
Hold that down. I need a medivac now.

1207
01:45:30,990 --> 01:45:32,390

Fuck. Galentine!

1208
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:33,590
没事的
It's all right.

1209
01:45:33,660 --> 01:45:35,720
杰利顿 快帮我接斯蒂尔上尉
Galentine! Get me Captain Steele!

1210
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:39,430
- 路兹 你还好吧 - J64号 请回答
- Sarg'nt Ruiz, how you doing? - Juliet 64, come in. Over.

1211
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:43,340
他们不会来接我们了 他们不会来了
They're not going to come and get us. They're not going to come for us.

1212
01:45:43,410 --> 01:45:46,470
给我闭嘴 振作点 打起精神来
I need you to suck it up, Sarg'nt. I need you to focus for me.

1213
01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:49,100
- 好啦 你做得到吗 - J64号 请回答
- All right? Can you do that? - Juliet 64, come in. Over.

1214
01:45:49,180 --> 01:45:51,080
你还能开枪吗
Now, can you hold your weapon?

1215
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:52,680
可以 长官
Yes, sir.

1216
01:45:52,780 --> 01:45:54,220
如果谁敢闯进来…
Anybody comes through that door...

1217
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:56,840
先往他胸部打两枪 再往脑袋上打一枪
you give him two in the chest and one in the head.

1218
01:45:56,920 --> 01:46:00,320
- 明白了吗 - 我还能战斗 长官
- You understand? - I'm still in the fight, sir.

1219
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:03,680
斯蒂尔上尉 我们这里有人需要救治
Captain Steele, I need a medivac in here now!

1220
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:06,250
- 史密斯下士中弹了 - 等一下 25号
- Corporal Smith has been hit! - Hold on, 25.

1221
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:08,030
我还可以打仗
Still in the fight.

1222
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:09,580
斯蒂尔上尉 他伤得很重
Captain Steele, he's hurt pretty bad.

1223
01:46:09,630 --> 01:46:13,570
25号 我们这里也有很多伤员 你只能暂时在原地处理
25, we got wounded, too. You're just gonna have to maintain your situation, over.

1224
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:16,200
如果半小时里不把他送进医院 就会没命了
If he doesn't get to a hospital in a half-hour, he's in trouble!

1225
01:46:16,710 --> 01:46:18,330
C-2 这里是64号
C-2, this is 64.

1226
01:46:18,580 --> 01:46:20,540
我们请求派遣医疗救援
I'm requesting an immediate medivac...

1227
01:46:20,610 --> 01:46:23,410
在第四小队那里有危重伤员
for a critically wounded at Chalk Four's location. Over.

1228
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:26,350
指挥部 第四小队请求医疗救援
Command, Chalk Four is requesting medivac.

1229
01:46:26,450 --> 01:46:28,780
不能冒险 战况还很激烈
Can't risk it. It's still too hot.

1230
01:46:29,250 --> 01:46:34,120
上尉 我们不能派出医疗救援 请支持下去
Captain, we cannot send in medivac at this time. Sit tight. Over.

1231
01:46:34,460 --> 01:46:38,420
25号 这里是64号 无法派遣医疗救援 他们办不到
25, this is 64. It's a negative on the medivac. It's not possible.

1232
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:42,260
联合指挥部不打算再派另一架直升机去冒险 你们要自己坚持下去
JOC cannot risk another bird. You're just gonna have to hold on.

1233
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:50,270
好吧 我们自己来
All right. I got him.

1234
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:52,770
直接压在伤口上
I want direct pressure on the wound.

1235
01:46:54,640 --> 01:46:57,110
你不会有事的 会好起来的
It's going to be all right. It's going to be okay.

1236
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:38,930
这是我们的直升机

1237
01:47:41,020 --> 01:47:44,290
这里是K11号 我到了杜兰特的坠机地点
This is Kilo 11. I'm at the Durant crash site.

1238
01:47:44,360 --> 01:47:45,760
收到
Roger that.

1239
01:48:07,580 --> 01:48:09,780
第二坠机地点清除
Crash site two secured.

1240
01:48:09,850 --> 01:48:12,190
克里布斯中校找你 长官
Lieutenant Colonel Cribbs for you, sir.

1241
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:13,450
克里布斯
Cribbs?

1242
01:48:13,530 --> 01:48:17,330
巴基斯坦体育场 第十山地师和联合国维和部队基地

1243
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:17,020
- 长官 他们还在讨论路线 - 还要多久
- Sir, they're still debating the route. - How long?

1244
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:19,390
还要好几个小时
At least a couple of hours.

1245
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:21,220
我们等不了那么长的时间 乔
We haven't got that long, Joe.

1246
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:25,890
巴基斯坦将军说我们事先没有通知他们这次行动
Pakistani General says, since we didn't deign to inform him of the raid...

1247
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,940
而且把第十山地师和一百辆车发动起来要花点时间
it's gonna take some time to mobilize the 10th Mountain and 100 vehicles.

1248
01:48:30,010 --> 01:48:32,000
你告诉那个将军
You tell the general this:

1249
01:48:32,210 --> 01:48:35,370
我知道 但我也要提醒他
I understand, but it is my duty to remind him...

1250
01:48:35,450 --> 01:48:39,110
我的手下被武装民兵团团包围
that my men are surrounded by thousands of armed Somali militia.

1251
01:48:39,380 --> 01:48:44,380
我们必须立刻把他们救出敌对区域 送进安全区
It is imperative that we move them out of the hostile area and into the safe zone.

1252
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:46,580
我现在就需要他的帮助
I need his help now.

1253
01:48:47,590 --> 01:48:48,820
是 长官
Yes, sir.

1254
01:48:53,930 --> 01:48:55,160
杜兰特
Durant.

1255
01:48:55,870 --> 01:48:57,800
迈克尔・杜兰特
Michael Durant.

1256
01:48:59,070 --> 01:49:00,130
是的
Yes.

1257
01:49:00,370 --> 01:49:02,770
你就是那些杀害我同胞的游骑兵
You are the Ranger who kills my people?

1258
01:49:03,140 --> 01:49:06,370
我不是游骑兵 我是飞行员
I'm not a Ranger. I'm a pilot.

1259
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:11,950
那就对了
That's right.

1260
01:49:12,450 --> 01:49:14,970
美国人不抽烟了
None of you Americans smoke anymore.

1261
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:22,520
你们都过着无趣的生活
You all live long, dull, uninteresting lives.

1262
01:49:25,230 --> 01:49:27,220
你为什么要抓我
What do you want with me?

1263
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:29,570
你们手上有我们的人质
You have taken hostages.

1264
01:49:30,730 --> 01:49:32,130
我们手上有你
We have you.

1265
01:49:32,370 --> 01:49:35,200
美国政府才不会跟你谈判
My government will never negotiate for me.

1266
01:49:36,140 --> 01:49:40,510
那么我就跟你谈判吧
Then perhaps you and I can negotiate, huh?

1267
01:49:42,250 --> 01:49:44,080
我们都是军人
Soldier to soldier.

1268
01:49:50,890 --> 01:49:52,550
我作不了决定的
I'm not in charge.

1269
01:49:55,690 --> 01:49:59,530
当然不能 你有能力杀人 却没有能力谈判
Of course not. You have the power to kill, but not negotiate.

1270
01:50:00,630 --> 01:50:03,760
在索马里 杀人就是谈判
In Somalia, killing is negotiation.

1271
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:08,300
你们真的以为你们抓到了艾迪德将军
Do you really think if you get General Aidid...

1272
01:50:08,810 --> 01:50:11,470
我们就会放下武器
we will simply put down our weapons...

1273
01:50:12,240 --> 01:50:14,540
接受美式民主
and adopt American democracy?

1274
01:50:15,650 --> 01:50:17,740
或是停止杀戮吗
That the killing will stop?

1275
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:21,940
我只知道没有胜利就没有和平
We know this: Without victory, there can be no peace.

1276
01:50:22,690 --> 01:50:25,310
杀戮永远不会停止
There will always be killing, you see?

1277
01:50:25,690 --> 01:50:28,250
这就是我们的方式
This is how things are in our world.

1278
01:50:40,670 --> 01:50:43,610
迈克・杜兰特 我们不会抛弃你
Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind.

1279
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:49,470
迈克・杜兰特 我们不会抛弃你
Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind.

1280
01:50:52,580 --> 01:50:55,380
换你来 用双手按住
You got to take over from me. Both hands.

1281
01:51:03,390 --> 01:51:06,360
伤口在股动脉 但是我看不到
It's the femoral artery, but I can't see it.

1282
01:51:06,830 --> 01:51:10,100
它一定缩进骨盆内了
Which means that it's retracted up into the pelvis.

1283
01:51:10,530 --> 01:51:14,830
我必须把伤口找出来 用止血钳把它夹住才能止血
Which means that I have to find it and clamp it. The only way to stop the bleeding.

1284
01:51:14,900 --> 01:51:16,570
但麻醉剂用完了
I got no more IV's.

1285
01:51:18,340 --> 01:51:21,170
所以我要你帮忙 好吗
So, I'm going to need you to assist. Okay?

1286
01:51:21,380 --> 01:51:22,740
好的
Yeah, yeah.

1287
01:51:23,880 --> 01:51:27,340
听好 杰米 我要做一件事 但会很痛的
Now listen, Jamie. I got to do something, it's going to hurt.

1288
01:51:27,420 --> 01:51:28,420
好吗
Okay?

1289
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:32,050
你会很痛的 不过只有这样我才能救你
I got to cause you more pain, but I have to do it to help you.

1290
01:51:32,120 --> 01:51:33,650
你听懂了吗
All right, you understand?

1291
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:36,060
- 吗啡呢 - 不能用
- Morphine. - I can't.

1292
01:51:36,130 --> 01:51:38,860
那会长时间降低你的心跳的
It'll lower your heart rate too far. I'm sorry.

1293
01:51:38,930 --> 01:51:41,490
汤布里 抓紧他的手
Twombly, why don't you take his hands there?

1294
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:48,630
我要把伤口撑开 紧紧压住他的大腿
I need you to hold the wound open, keep pressure on the top of the leg.

1295
01:51:48,710 --> 01:51:51,040
尤瑞克 你也抓住一只脚 顺便帮我拿着手电筒
Yurek, you're gonna take the feet and a flashlight.

1296
01:51:51,110 --> 01:51:52,270
听我数数
On my count.

1297
01:51:52,340 --> 01:51:54,500
准备好了 杰米
All right, Jamie. All right.

1298
01:51:56,610 --> 01:51:58,510
一 二…
One. Two.

1299
01:51:59,580 --> 01:52:00,640

Three.

1300
01:52:08,360 --> 01:52:10,550
等等 好 找到了
Wait, wait. Okay. I feel it.

1301
01:52:11,260 --> 01:52:12,890
我找到了
I feel the pulse.

1302
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:15,700
我找到了
I got it. I got it.

1303
01:52:15,770 --> 01:52:17,360
我找到了 我找到了
I got it, yeah. I got it.

1304
01:52:17,430 --> 01:52:19,300
- 我找到了 - 你找到什么
- I got it. - You got it?

1305
01:52:19,470 --> 01:52:20,600
钳住伤口了
Clamp?

1306
01:52:22,940 --> 01:52:24,300
我钳住了
I got it clamped.

1307
01:52:24,370 --> 01:52:25,570
- 坚持住 - 钳住它
- Hold it. - Got it.

1308
01:52:25,640 --> 01:52:26,900
这里 快抓住
Here, grab it.

1309
01:52:27,580 --> 01:52:29,310
- 撕开它 - 我找到了
- It's tearing. - I got it.

1310
01:52:29,550 --> 01:52:31,410
- 医生 它又缩回去了 - 抓住它

1311
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:32,710
撕开了
It's tearing!

1312
01:52:33,050 --> 01:52:36,310
- 好 撑开伤口 - 撑开了
- Okay. Get out. Hold the wound. - Okay, I'm holding.

1313
01:52:37,490 --> 01:52:39,010
把手拿开
Move your hand.

1314
01:52:49,970 --> 01:52:51,060
怎么了
What?

1315
01:53:10,290 --> 01:53:11,450
治好了吗
Fix it?

1316
01:53:14,890 --> 01:53:17,190
是的 治好了
Yeah, yeah. We got it.

1317
01:53:32,980 --> 01:53:34,880
你在干什么
What the hell are you doing?

1318
01:53:34,940 --> 01:53:39,280
磨咖啡豆的关键是不能磨得太细 也不能太粗
It's all in the grind, Sarg'nt. Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.

1319
01:53:39,620 --> 01:53:41,850
格里姆斯 你弄好了
Grimesy, you are squared away.

1320
01:53:58,600 --> 01:54:02,040
军士 来一杯热腾腾的咖啡吧
Sarg'nt, how would you like a nice hot cup of Joe?

1321
01:54:04,110 --> 01:54:05,730
黄金海岸口味的
Gold Coast blend.

1322
01:54:06,110 --> 01:54:09,100
坐下来 我看看你的伤口
Sit down. I want to take a look at that foot.

1323
01:54:09,610 --> 01:54:12,100
- 没什么大不了的 - 坐下吧
- No, it's not a problem. - Come on, come on.

1324
01:54:18,190 --> 01:54:21,390
- 他们从哪儿把你找来的 - 办公桌后面
- Where the hell did they find you? - Behind a desk.

1325
01:54:22,790 --> 01:54:25,520
是真的 我没开玩笑
No, really. What, you think I'm kidding?

1326
01:54:29,370 --> 01:54:31,330
- 有人受伤吗 - 没有
- Is anybody hit? - We're good!

1327
01:54:36,710 --> 01:54:37,900
你们没事吧
You all right?

1328
01:54:37,970 --> 01:54:38,970
没事
Yeah!

1329
01:54:39,140 --> 01:54:40,630
大家都没事吧
Is everybody all right?

1330
01:54:40,710 --> 01:54:41,730
没事
Yeah!

1331
01:54:55,490 --> 01:54:56,750
敌袭
Incoming!

1332
01:55:09,710 --> 01:55:11,700
继续开火 快点

1333
01:56:02,230 --> 01:56:04,460
迪托马索中弹 把他救出去
DiTomasso's hit! Pull him out!

1334
01:56:37,790 --> 01:56:39,520
游骑兵 这里是K11号
Ranger here. This is Kilo 11.

1335
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:42,940
我们是第四小队 在坠机地点的东南角 你是谁
This is Chalk Four. We're at the southeast corner of the crash site. Who's this? Over.

1386
02:00:12,110 --> 02:00:13,170

你已经尽了力
You did all you could here.

1391

他们应该派医疗队来的

它一定会被击落的 我们没法再防守一个坠机地点
Right now we'd be out there defending another crashed chopper.

1393
02:01:22,210 --> 02:01:24,300
会有更多的人受伤
More men would get torn up.

1394

也许吧
Maybe.

02:01:29,450 --> 02:01:31,580
别想那么多
See, you're thinking. Don't.

1396
02:01:32,560 --> 02:01:35,720
中士 你不能决定让谁来受伤
Because, Sergeant, you can't control who gets hit or who doesn't.

1397
02:01:35,790 --> 02:01:38,260
或是谁从直升机上摔落
Who falls out of a chopper or why.

1398
02:01:38,490 --> 02:01:40,930

It ain't up to you. It's just war.

1399
02:01:43,130 --> 02:01:45,430
是的 但史密斯还是死了
Yeah, well, Smith's still dead.

1400
02:01:46,600 --> 02:01:49,210
都是因为布莱克博德摔下来 然后才发生那么多事
If Blackburn wouldn't have fallen, none of this would have happened.

1401
02:01:49,240 --> 02:01:51,500
你想这么多也没用
Should have or could have, it don't matter.

1402
02:01:51,570 --> 02:01:55,340
以后你有的是时间去想
You'll get plenty of time to think about all that later. Believe me.

1403
02:01:59,220 --> 02:02:01,780

You need to start thinking about getting these men out of here.

1406
02:02:14,860 --> 02:02:16,890

Easy.

1471
02:08:25,870 --> 02:08:28,100
上校 怎么回事
Colonel, what is going on down there?

1472
02:08:28,170 --> 02:08:31,370
他们要绕着尸体来拆开驾驶舱
They're dismantling the entire cockpit around the body.

1473
02:08:31,570 --> 02:08:35,240
还要多久 实话实说
How long is it going to take? I need an honest, no-shit assessment.

1474
02:08:36,180 --> 02:08:37,540
说不准
They can't say!

1475
02:08:39,520 --> 02:08:40,740
丹尼
Danny...

1476
02:08:42,250 --> 02:08:44,050
绝对不能抛弃同袍
no one gets left behind.

1477
02:08:44,750 --> 02:08:46,650
你明白吗
You understand me, son?

1478
02:08:47,060 --> 02:08:48,520
明白 将军
Yes, General.

1479
02:08:49,390 --> 02:08:51,020
该怎么做就怎么做
You do what you have to do.

1480
02:08:52,190 --> 02:08:53,350
收到

1482
02:09:05,940 --> 02:09:08,410

- We don't have 45 minutes. - What?

1483
02:09:09,450 --> 02:09:13,640
我们等不了45分钟 懂吗
We don't have 45 minutes. Do you understand?

1484
02:09:15,220 --> 02:09:16,840
明白吗
Do you understand?

1485
02:09:18,450 --> 02:09:19,550
好吧
Okay.

1486
02:09:19,920 --> 02:09:22,820
- 快 把他抬出来 - 好了
- All right, come on. Bring him through. - I got him.

1487
02:09:23,360 --> 02:09:26,520
- 把伤员都救出来 - 来了
- Get all of his gear. Get the wounded out. - Got you, sir!

1488
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:31,600
10月4日 星期一 早上5:45

1489
02:09:31,830 --> 02:09:33,960

1492
02:09:50,120 --> 02:09:51,280
要炸了
Fire in the hole!

1493
02:09:51,350 --> 02:09:53,250
- 走吧 快走 - 走
- Let's go! Move! - Let's go! Let's go!

1494
02:10:09,440 --> 02:10:12,840
- 开舱门 让我们进去 - 挤不下了 坐车顶吧
- Open up the hatch! We got men back here! - No room here! Go on the roof!

1495
02:10:12,910 --> 02:10:14,000
怎么回事
What's going on?

1496
02:10:14,080 --> 02:10:17,140
- 车顶 - 我才不坐车顶
- The roof? - I'm not getting on no fucking roof!

1497
02:10:18,050 --> 02:10:19,450
没地方坐了
No, no, it's full.

1498
02:10:20,520 --> 02:10:23,710
跑吧 继续前进 用车子作掩护
We're running out. Keep moving. Use the vehicles as cover.

1499
02:10:26,560 --> 02:10:28,220
走吧 出发
Move it! Let's go!

1500
02:10:45,540 --> 02:10:47,980
等一下 等一下
All right, hold it up. Hold it up.

1501
02:10:50,080 --> 02:10:51,600
- 快走 - 快走
- Move! - Go! Move!

1502
02:10:51,680 --> 02:10:52,700
快
Go!

1503
02:11:47,640 --> 02:11:49,660
趴下 趴下
Get down! Get down!

1504
02:11:51,310 --> 02:11:52,830
快趴下
Get down, lady!

1505
02:11:55,310 --> 02:11:56,680
我没子弹了
I'm out of ammo!

1506
02:11:57,510 --> 02:11:59,610
山德森 我没子弹了
Sanderson, I'm out of ammo!

1507
02:12:04,990 --> 02:12:06,580
别拿枪
Don't you do it.

1508
02:12:07,020 --> 02:12:09,510
- 你在干嘛 - 别去拿枪
- What are you doing? - Don't you damn do it.

1509
02:12:11,160 --> 02:12:12,750
库尔特 走吧
Kurth, let's go!

1510

小心 小心
Easy. Easy.

1511
02:15:38,470 --> 02:15:40,230
啊 该死的
Ah, shit.

1512
02:15:40,300 --> 02:15:43,930
子弹错过你的颈静脉了 别动
Bullet missed your jugular by about three millimeters. Don't move.

1513
02:15:50,450 --> 02:15:52,240
下次看准点 走吧
Aim later. Go!

1514
02:15:53,380 --> 02:15:54,410
走
Go!

1515
02:15:58,420 --> 02:16:00,150
动作快点
Hurry up, hurry up.

1516
02:16:02,720 --> 02:16:06,680
嘿 别让他自个儿爬 帮帮他
Hey, don't let that man crawl. Somebody help that man.

1517
02:16:06,900 --> 02:16:08,390
帮帮他
Help him.

1518
02:16:11,200 --> 02:16:13,500
格里姆斯 干得好
Grimes, you did good.

1519
02:16:36,020 --> 02:16:37,290
该死
Oh, shit!

1520
02:17:08,290 --> 02:17:10,090
浴场在哪儿 少校
Where are the baths, Major?

1521
02:17:10,160 --> 02:17:11,850
从这儿过去就是 上尉
They're through there, Captain.

1522
02:17:37,620 --> 02:17:38,710
路兹
Ruiz.

1523
02:17:40,020 --> 02:17:42,550
嘿 中士
Hey, Sarg'nt. Hey.

1524
02:17:46,230 --> 02:17:47,390
上尉
Captain.

1525
02:17:47,460 --> 02:17:49,990
洛伦佐 你还好吧
Lorenzo. How you doing?

1526
02:17:52,870 --> 02:17:57,600
子弹擦过去 军医说我过两天就好了
It went in and out, so the medic said I should be okay in a couple of days.

1527
02:17:57,910 --> 02:17:59,570
真是好消息
That's great news.

1528
02:18:00,380 --> 02:18:01,770
我们要回去吗
We're going after them?

1529
02:18:01,840 --> 02:18:04,740
当然了 不过我们得先重整队伍
You bet your ass we will. We got to regroup.

1530
02:18:06,250 --> 02:18:08,220
别把我留下来
Don't go out without me.

1531
02:18:09,220 --> 02:18:11,980
别丢下我就回去
Don't go back out there without me.

1532
02:18:13,590 --> 02:18:15,450
我还能打仗
I can still do my job.

1533
02:18:17,190 --> 02:18:19,320
好好休息吧
You get some rest now, okay?

1534
02:18:21,260 --> 02:18:22,420
格里姆斯
Grimes.

1535
02:18:24,070 --> 02:18:27,630
没咖啡 我给你倒点茶吧
Little short on coffee, but I got you some tea.

1536
02:18:32,270 --> 02:18:33,900
还好吗 士兵
How you doing, soldier?

1537
02:18:35,080 --> 02:18:36,810
没感觉了
Can't feel a thing.

1538
02:18:53,130 --> 02:18:54,930
你要回去
You're going back in?

1539
02:18:56,500 --> 02:18:58,730
在那里还有弟兄
There are still men out there.

1540
02:19:00,800 --> 02:19:02,060
该死
God damn.

1541
02:19:07,480 --> 02:19:09,100
我每次回家
When I go home...

1542
02:19:09,840 --> 02:19:11,370
他们都问我
and people ask me:

1543
02:19:11,450 --> 02:19:14,110
胡特 你为什么从军
"Hey, Hoot, why do you do it, man?"

1544
02:19:15,380 --> 02:19:19,010
难道你是打仗打上瘾了吗
"Why? You some kind of war junkie?"

1545
02:19:20,020 --> 02:19:22,110
我一句话也说不出来
I won't say a goddamn word.

1546
02:19:22,760 --> 02:19:23,850
为什么
Why?

1547
02:19:24,860 --> 02:19:26,720
他们不会懂
They won't understand.

1548
02:19:28,260 --> 02:19:30,750
他们不懂我们干嘛要打仗
They won't understand why we do it.

1549
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:35,370
我们是为了袍泽而拼命
They won't understand it's about the men next to you.

1550
02:19:37,940 --> 02:19:39,430
就这么简单
And that's it.

1551
02:19:41,380 --> 02:19:43,000
很简单
That's all it is.

1552
02:19:51,890 --> 02:19:56,820
想都别想 我习惯单枪匹马
Hey, don't even think about it, all right? I'm better on my own.

1553
02:20:01,860 --> 02:20:04,960
星期一 又是一周的开始
Hey, we started a whole new week. It's Monday.

1554
02:20:18,710 --> 02:20:20,680
过几天 布莱克博德问我
I was talking to Blackburn the other day...

1555
02:20:20,750 --> 02:20:24,880
什么改变了 我们为什么要回家
and he asked me, "What changed? Why are we going home?"

1556
02:20:26,990 --> 02:20:28,850
我说什么都没变
And I said, "Nothing."

1557
02:20:29,520 --> 02:20:33,260
但这不是实话 我想 一切都变了
But that's not true, you know. I think everything's changed.

1558
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:36,490
我也变了
I know I've changed.

1559
02:20:42,270 --> 02:20:45,000
曾经有一个朋友问我
A friend of mine asked me before I got here...

1560
02:20:45,070 --> 02:20:47,300
那是在我们被派来这儿之前
It was when we were all shipping out.

1561
02:20:47,380 --> 02:20:48,770
他问我
He asked me:

1562
02:20:50,210 --> 02:20:53,340
你为什么要去打别人的仗
"Why are you going to fight somebody else's war?"

1563
02:20:53,750 --> 02:20:56,340
你自以为是英雄吗
"What, do y'all think you're heroes?"

1564
02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:01,850
当时我不知道该说什么
I didn't know what to say at the time...

1565
02:21:04,430 --> 02:21:07,020
现在我的答案是 不
but if he asked me again, I'd say no.

1566
02:21:09,430 --> 02:21:11,760
我不想当英雄
I'd say there's no way in hell.

1567
02:21:12,530 --> 02:21:14,560
没有人想当英雄
Nobody asks to be a hero.

1568
02:21:19,910 --> 02:21:22,170
只是时势造英雄
It just sometimes turns out that way.

1569
02:21:26,180 --> 02:21:29,640
回家后 我会去找你的父母
I'm gonna talk to your ma and pa when I get home, okay?

1570
02:22:32,500 --> 02:22:34,200
一千多名索马里人死亡

1571
02:22:34,300 --> 02:22:35,700
十九名美军阵亡

1572
02:22:36,320 --> 02:22:40,010
我的爱 你会坚强地活下去
My love, you are strong and you will do well in life.

1573
02:22:42,190 --> 02:22:44,660
我爱你和我的孩子
I love you and my children deeply.

1574
02:22:45,560 --> 02:22:48,760
每一天都会茁壮成长
Today and tomorrow, let each day grow and grow.

1575
02:22:50,300 --> 02:22:54,460
保持笑容 千万别被困境打倒
Keep smiling and never give up, even when things get you down.

1576
02:22:55,770 --> 02:22:58,200
最后 我的爱
So, in closing, my love...

1577
02:22:58,570 --> 02:23:02,410
今晚替我哄我的孩子入睡
tonight, tuck my children in bed warmly.

1578
02:23:02,840 --> 02:23:06,750
跟他们说我爱他们 替我拥抱他们…
Tell them I love them. Then hug them for me...

1579
02:23:07,650 --> 02:23:10,020
替爸爸亲吻他们 给他们道晚安
and give them both a kiss good night for Daddy.

1580
02:23:11,590 --> 02:23:13,590
"三角洲"的加里・戈登军士和兰迪・舒加特军士

1581
02:23:13,630 --> 02:23:15,620
是越战之后第一次

1582
02:23:15,670 --> 02:23:17,570
获追赠荣誉勋章的士兵

1583
02:23:17,600 --> 02:23:21,590
迈克・杜兰特被囚禁十一天后获释

1584
02:23:21,740 --> 02:23:27,200
两星期后 克林顿总统命令从索马里撤军

1585
02:23:29,900 --> 02:23:32,580
威廉・加里森少将为这次突击行动负起全责

1586
02:23:32,620 --> 02:23:36,610
1996年8月2日穆罕默德・艾迪德遭刺杀

1587
02:23:36,750 --> 02:23:40,710
翌日 加里森少将退役
