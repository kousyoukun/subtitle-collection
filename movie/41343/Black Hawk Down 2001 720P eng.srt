1
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:33,741
There.

2
00:03:34,182 --> 00:03:35,945
Technicals, nine o'clock.

3
00:04:01,443 --> 00:04:03,138
Oh, shit! Did you see that?

4
00:04:03,345 --> 00:04:07,441
Chief, we got unarmed civilians
getting shot down here at nine o'clock.

5
00:04:07,649 --> 00:04:10,812
I got it, Matt.
I don't think we can touch this.

6
00:04:18,893 --> 00:04:20,258
Command, Super 64...

7
00:04:20,328 --> 00:04:24,059
We got militia shooting civilians
at the food distribution center.

8
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:26,400
Request permission to engage.

9
00:04:26,468 --> 00:04:28,800
Super 64, are you taking fire? Over.

10
00:04:29,371 --> 00:04:30,804
Negative, command.

11
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:34,568
UN's jurisdiction, 64.
We cannot intervene.

12
00:04:34,676 --> 00:04:36,337
Return to base. Over.
Roger.

13
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:38,674
64 returning.

14
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:28,222
Ready, Mr. Atto.

15
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:40,538
Leaving.

16
00:06:45,673 --> 00:06:47,402
General Garrison?

17
00:06:47,475 --> 00:06:48,840
No, thanks. I got one.

18
00:06:49,043 --> 00:06:50,806
But these are Cuban.

19
00:06:51,146 --> 00:06:53,046
Bolivar Belicoso.

20
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:54,470
So is this.

21
00:06:56,918 --> 00:06:58,977
Miami, my friend, is not Cuba.

22
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:09,530
I see not catching Aidid
is becoming a routine.

23
00:07:10,465 --> 00:07:13,400
We weren't trying to catch Aidid.
We were trying to catch you.

24
00:07:13,468 --> 00:07:14,298
Me?

25
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:16,769
But am I that important?

26
00:07:17,138 --> 00:07:18,730
I hardly think so.

27
00:07:18,907 --> 00:07:21,933
You're just a businessman.
Trying to make a living.

28
00:07:22,143 --> 00:07:24,873
Yeah. Selling guns to Aidid's militia.

29
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:31,408
You've been here, what?

30
00:07:32,987 --> 00:07:34,545
Six weeks?

31
00:07:36,658 --> 00:07:39,786
Six weeks you are trying
to catch the general.

32
00:07:40,295 --> 00:07:42,490
You put up reward posters.

33
00:07:42,997 --> 00:07:47,263
$25,000. What is this?
Gunfight at the KO Corral?

34
00:07:48,503 --> 00:07:51,495
It's the OK Corral.

35
00:07:52,006 --> 00:07:56,170
Do you think bringing me in will
make him suddenly come to you?

36
00:07:56,377 --> 00:07:58,572
Make him more agreeable?

37
00:08:01,115 --> 00:08:03,140
You know where he sleeps.

38
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:07,243
You pay for his beds,
much less his militia.

39
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:12,117
We're not leaving
Somalia till we find him.

40
00:08:13,728 --> 00:08:14,956
And we will find him.

41
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:17,657
Don't think because I grew
up without running water...

42
00:08:17,732 --> 00:08:19,723
I am simple, General.

43
00:08:20,768 --> 00:08:23,134
I do know something about history.

44
00:08:23,705 --> 00:08:28,142
See all this?
It's simply shaping tomorrow.

45
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:32,769
A tomorrow without a lot of
Arkansas white boys' ideas in it.

46
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:36,348
Well, I wouldn't know about that.
I'm from Texas.

47
00:08:36,551 --> 00:08:40,681
Mr. Garrison, I think you
shouldn't have come here.

48
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:43,189
This is civil war.

49
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:45,989
This is our war.

50
00:08:46,728 --> 00:08:47,990
Not yours.

51
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:52,495
300,000 dead and counting.

52
00:08:52,734 --> 00:08:56,067
That's not a war, Mr. Atto.
That's genocide.

53
00:08:57,572 --> 00:09:00,166
Now, you enjoy that tea, you hear?

54
00:09:05,847 --> 00:09:07,610
How'd he strike you?

55
00:09:07,749 --> 00:09:10,877
Urbane, sophisticated, cruel.

56
00:09:10,952 --> 00:09:12,715
Yeah, he's a good catch.

57
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:15,553
It'll take time,
but Aidid will feel the loss.

58
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:18,490
I'm not sure time is something
we got in great supply.

59
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,724
This isn't Iraq, you know.
Much more complicated than that.

60
00:09:23,164 --> 00:09:25,155
Boss, most of Washington might disagree.

61
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:29,397
They've been calling for situation
reports every morning this week.

62
00:09:30,471 --> 00:09:34,805
Well, tell them the situation is fragile.

63
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:43,983
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Cliff "Elvis" Wolcott.

64
00:09:44,185 --> 00:09:45,812
I'll be your pilot today.

65
00:09:45,887 --> 00:09:49,983
Federal regulations designate this
a non-smoking Black Hawk helicopter.

66
00:09:50,058 --> 00:09:54,392
Those in Mogadishu frequent flyer
program will earn 100 free credits.

67
00:09:54,596 --> 00:09:59,124
And as always, the air sickness bags
are located in the seatback in front of you.

68
00:10:00,168 --> 00:10:03,001
Number one indications are good, Cliff.
Put her on two.

69
00:10:03,304 --> 00:10:04,532
You're still clear.

70
00:10:19,754 --> 00:10:23,019
61, this is 64. Go to UHF secure.

71
00:10:23,257 --> 00:10:24,417
I've got some bad news.

72
00:10:25,593 --> 00:10:28,323
"Limo" is a word, Durant.
I don't want to hear about it.

73
00:10:28,596 --> 00:10:31,258
It is not a word.
It's an abbreviation of a word.

74
00:10:31,466 --> 00:10:33,434
"Limo" is a word in common usage.

75
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:37,298
That is the key phrase in Scrabble,
my good friend. Common usage.

76
00:10:37,472 --> 00:10:40,464
If it's not in the
dictionary it doesn't count!

77
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,634
It doesn't have to be in the dictionary!

78
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,871
It does have to be in the dictionary!

79
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:48,278
When we get back to the base,
it's coming off.

80
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:51,981
You touch my "limo" and
I'll spank you, Nightstalker.

81
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,178
Yeah, promises.

82
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:56,685
That's a nice beach down there.

83
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:58,447
How's the water?

84
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,828
Yeah, it's nice and warm.
And it's loaded with sharks.

85
00:11:09,003 --> 00:11:10,493
Name.
Todd.

86
00:11:10,872 --> 00:11:12,635
Last name.
Blackburn.

87
00:11:14,442 --> 00:11:16,137
First name, Todd.

88
00:11:16,444 --> 00:11:19,277
So, what's it like?
What's what like?

89
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,708
Mogadishu. The fighting.

90
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:24,716
Serial number.

91
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,583
Firstly, it's "the Mog" or simply "Mog."
No one calls it Mogadishu here.

92
00:11:29,657 --> 00:11:33,058
Secondly, I wouldn't know about
the fighting, so don't ask.

93
00:11:33,661 --> 00:11:34,650
Why not?

94
00:11:35,163 --> 00:11:36,755
Didn't I just say, "Don't ask"?

95
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:42,964
You look like you're about 12,
so let me explain something to you.

96
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:46,598
I have a rare and mysterious skill
that precludes me from doing missions.

97
00:11:48,076 --> 00:11:49,043
Typing.

98
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:51,543
Can you type?
No.

99
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,008
Date of birth.
2-27-75.

100
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:03,854
Well, I'm here to kick some ass.

101
00:12:08,696 --> 00:12:10,129
Let's bring it in.

102
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:27,576
Nice, man! Very smooth!

103
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:29,846
Single shot through the engine block.

104
00:12:30,518 --> 00:12:33,214
Shit, that's a shame.
That was a nice jeep.

105
00:12:56,978 --> 00:12:59,276
Cease fire! Cease fire!

106
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:00,971
Check your weapons!

107
00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:02,204
Sergeant Eversmann.

108
00:13:06,587 --> 00:13:08,054
Private First Class Blackburn.

109
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:09,378
Yeah?

110
00:13:09,991 --> 00:13:11,049
Reporting for duty.

111
00:13:11,726 --> 00:13:16,060
Not to me. You're reporting to Lt. Beales.
He should be around here somewhere.

112
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,356
Can I leave him with you?

113
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,390
Yeah, go ahead.

114
00:13:20,768 --> 00:13:22,668
You brought your weapon.
Yes, sir.

115
00:13:23,004 --> 00:13:24,801
Want me to shoot? I'm rested.

116
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:28,040
When did you get in?
Just now, Sergeant.

117
00:13:32,947 --> 00:13:34,073
Hey, who's hungry?

118
00:13:56,604 --> 00:13:59,937
What is this, Sarg'nt?
Another taxpayer-funded Delta safari?

119
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,200
Not if General Garrison is asking.
I'm asking.

120
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:05,602
Have a nice meal, Captain.

121
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:12,715
Hey, man, there's a line.
I know.

122
00:14:13,154 --> 00:14:16,555
Well, this isn't the back of it.
Yeah, I know.

123
00:14:17,892 --> 00:14:20,087
Sergeant. Sergeant.

124
00:14:20,795 --> 00:14:21,989
What's going on here?

125
00:14:22,063 --> 00:14:25,089
Some aerial target practice, sir.
Didn't want to leave it behind.

126
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,327
I'm talking about your weapon.

127
00:14:27,435 --> 00:14:30,029
Delta or no Delta, that's a hot weapon.

128
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:33,503
You know better than that.
Safety should be on at all times on base.

129
00:14:33,574 --> 00:14:35,940
Well, this is my safety, sir.

130
00:14:38,746 --> 00:14:41,715
Let it go, sir.
The guy hasn't eaten in a couple of days.

131
00:14:41,782 --> 00:14:44,615
You Delta boys are a bunch
of undisciplined cowboys.

132
00:14:45,486 --> 00:14:47,317
Let me tell you something, Sarg'nt.

133
00:14:47,521 --> 00:14:51,287
When we get on a five-yard line,
you're going to need my Rangers.

134
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:53,418
Y'all better learn to be team players.

135
00:14:55,196 --> 00:14:56,686
We're done here.

136
00:15:06,307 --> 00:15:09,799
Speak up. You say this is your safety?

137
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:11,808
Well, this is my boot, son.

138
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,081
And it will fit up your ass
with the proper amount of force.

139
00:15:16,284 --> 00:15:19,913
Is that a Jersey accent?
I'm trying to do this, give me a break.

140
00:15:20,121 --> 00:15:21,986
Take those sunglasses off.

141
00:15:22,123 --> 00:15:24,455
Delta wants to wear Oakleys,
that's their business.

142
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:26,755
I don't want to see them on you again.

143
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:30,224
Is that a hot weapon?

144
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:36,934
Is that your move?

145
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,969
Is my hand on the piece?

146
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:41,773
I can mate you in three whatever you do.

147
00:15:43,244 --> 00:15:46,543
I'd keep my eye on that queen
before counseling others.

148
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:49,149
Well, she's just lying in wait.

149
00:15:53,054 --> 00:15:54,043
Yikes.

150
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,282
It's good. You're really improving.

151
00:15:59,794 --> 00:16:02,388
If I may make a suggestion-- Observation.

152
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:03,585
Go ahead.

153
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:06,163
It's a children's book, right?
Right.

154
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:10,897
They are not supposed to scare the
living shit out of the children.

155
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:14,804
This is the part of the story where
our knight is slaying the dragon.

156
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,537
That's scary.
Besides, my daughter loves this stuff.

157
00:16:17,611 --> 00:16:19,602
Thought you finished that last week.

158
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:21,509
You done?

159
00:16:23,084 --> 00:16:26,576
Hey, we are at the
10-yard line here, men.

160
00:16:26,754 --> 00:16:28,244
You understand?

161
00:16:28,756 --> 00:16:31,247
Can you count? One, two, ten.

162
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,920
Okay? Where are my running backs?

163
00:16:34,128 --> 00:16:35,925
Where are my running backs?

164
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:40,559
Hey, I didn't see you
at church on Sunday.

165
00:16:40,768 --> 00:16:42,702
You had something more important to do?

166
00:16:42,903 --> 00:16:45,337
Not on Sunday, you don't. Not anymore.

167
00:16:45,406 --> 00:16:47,704
I will make you believe, you understand?

168
00:17:02,957 --> 00:17:04,356
Pretty funny, hoo-ah?

169
00:17:07,395 --> 00:17:10,922
It was a good impression.
I recognize myself.

170
00:17:13,401 --> 00:17:15,198
All right, carry on.

171
00:17:15,903 --> 00:17:18,736
I'd like a word, specialist.
Sir.

172
00:17:19,407 --> 00:17:22,899
You understand why we have a
chain of command, don't you?

173
00:17:23,077 --> 00:17:23,975
Roger that, sir.

174
00:17:24,045 --> 00:17:27,537
If you ever undermine me again,
you'll clean latrines with your tongue...

175
00:17:27,615 --> 00:17:30,641
Till you taste no difference
between shit and French fries.

176
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:31,844
Are we clear?
Hoo-ah, sir.

177
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:32,851
All right.

178
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:41,752
Listen to this:

179
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:46,596
If one skinny kills another his clan
owes the dead guy's clan a hundred camels.

180
00:17:46,934 --> 00:17:48,128
A hundred camels.

181
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:50,599
Camels. I wouldn't pay one camel.

182
00:17:51,105 --> 00:17:53,039
Must be a lot of fucking camel debt.

183
00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:55,739
Is that really true, Lieutenant?

184
00:17:55,943 --> 00:17:57,968
Ask Sgt. Eversmann. He likes skinnies.

185
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:01,040
Sgt. Eversmann,
you really like the skinnies?

186
00:18:01,482 --> 00:18:05,213
It's not that I like them or I don't like them.
I respect them.

187
00:18:05,386 --> 00:18:09,550
See, what you guys fail to realize is
the sergeant is a bit of an idealist.

188
00:18:10,191 --> 00:18:13,592
He believes in this mission down
to his bones. Don't you, Sergeant?

189
00:18:13,828 --> 00:18:17,093
Look, these people, they have no jobs...

190
00:18:17,331 --> 00:18:21,427
No food, no education, no future.

191
00:18:21,502 --> 00:18:25,097
I just figure that, I mean,
we have two things that we can do.

192
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:26,696
We can help...

193
00:18:26,774 --> 00:18:30,210
Or we can sit back and watch the
country destroy itself on CNN.

194
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:31,266
Right?

195
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:34,581
I don't know about you guys,
but I was trained to fight.

196
00:18:34,782 --> 00:18:36,841
Are you trained to fight, Sergeant?

197
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:39,715
Well, I think I was trained
to make a difference, Kurth.

198
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:43,254
Like the man said, he's an idealist.

199
00:18:45,025 --> 00:18:47,084
Oh, wait. This is my favorite part.

200
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,498
Stay away from the cans!

201
00:18:54,735 --> 00:18:57,101
Die, gas-pumper!

202
00:18:57,771 --> 00:18:59,568
Stay away from those cans!

203
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:06,605
No, no, stay back.

204
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,672
He's having a seizure.
Put something in his mouth.

205
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:14,687
John, it's okay.
John, it's okay. It's okay.

206
00:20:01,068 --> 00:20:03,901
Well, he'll be fine.
But not in this army.

207
00:20:04,905 --> 00:20:07,567
He's out of the game.
He's epileptic, going home.

208
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:14,707
I'm putting you in charge of his chalk.

209
00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:17,982
You got a problem with that?
No, sir.

210
00:20:18,052 --> 00:20:20,145
It's a big responsibility.

211
00:20:20,221 --> 00:20:22,781
Your men will look to you
to make the right decisions.

212
00:20:22,856 --> 00:20:24,915
Their lives depend on it.

213
00:20:25,993 --> 00:20:27,221
All right.

214
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:30,864
Rangers lead the way, sir.
All the way.

215
00:20:31,065 --> 00:20:32,498
Good luck.

216
00:21:16,043 --> 00:21:20,810
A meeting of Aidid's senior cabinet
may take place today at 1500 hours.

217
00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:24,379
I say "may" because
we all know by now...

218
00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:27,850
With the intel we get on the street,
nothing is certain.

219
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:30,888
This is actual intel
confirmed by three sources.

220
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:34,785
Two tier-one personalities
may be present:

221
00:21:35,262 --> 00:21:39,289
Omar Salad, Aidid's top political advisor...

222
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:41,960
And Abdi Hassan Awale, interior minister.

223
00:21:42,036 --> 00:21:44,027
These are the guys we're after.

224
00:21:44,905 --> 00:21:46,270
Today we go.

225
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,331
Same mission template as before.

226
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:53,672
1545, Assault Force Delta will
infiltrate the target building...

227
00:21:53,881 --> 00:21:56,076
And seize all suspects within.

228
00:21:56,283 --> 00:22:00,185
Security Force Rangers: 4 Ranger chalks,
under command of Capt. Steele...

229
00:22:00,254 --> 00:22:02,518
Will rope in at 1546...

230
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:06,023
And hold a four-corner perimeter
around the target building.

231
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,891
No one gets in or out.

232
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:09,686
Extraction Force:

233
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:14,525
Lt. Colonel McKnight's humvee
column will drive in at 1547...

234
00:22:14,735 --> 00:22:18,671
On Hawlwadig Road and hold
just short of the Olympic Hotel.

235
00:22:18,872 --> 00:22:20,339
Wait for the green light.

236
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,406
Now once Delta gives the word...

237
00:22:22,643 --> 00:22:27,342
McKnight's column will go to the target
and load the prisoners onto trucks.

238
00:22:27,915 --> 00:22:30,315
Immediately after the
prisoners are loaded...

239
00:22:30,484 --> 00:22:34,580
The four Ranger chalks will collapse
back to the target building...

240
00:22:34,822 --> 00:22:36,187
Load up on humvees...

241
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:40,258
And the entire ground force will
exfil the 3 miles back to base.

242
00:22:40,561 --> 00:22:43,792
Mission time, no longer than 30 minutes.

243
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:49,733
Now, I had requested light armor
and AC-130 Spectre gunships...

244
00:22:49,937 --> 00:22:53,998
But Washington, in all its wisdom,
decided against this.

245
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,039
Too high-profile.

246
00:22:56,276 --> 00:22:59,439
So Black Hawks and Little Birds
will provide the air cover...

247
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,875
With miniguns and 2.75 rockets.

248
00:23:02,116 --> 00:23:03,481
Colonel Harrell.

249
00:23:03,684 --> 00:23:08,018
In the C-2 bird, Colonel Matthews
will coordinate the air mission...

250
00:23:08,522 --> 00:23:11,355
And I will coordinate ground forces.

251
00:23:11,692 --> 00:23:12,989
Colonel Matthews.

252
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,359
Mission launch code word is Irene.

253
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,819
Questions?

254
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:22,399
Which building is it, sir?

255
00:23:22,936 --> 00:23:26,531
We're confirming that now.
Somewhere near the Bakara market.

256
00:23:29,176 --> 00:23:32,168
I don't choose the time
or place of their meetings.

257
00:23:32,346 --> 00:23:34,143
I didn't say a word, sir.

258
00:23:34,448 --> 00:23:37,849
Make no mistake, once you're
in the Bakara market...

259
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:40,318
You're in an entirely hostile district.

260
00:23:40,854 --> 00:23:43,220
Don't underestimate their capabilities.

261
00:23:43,457 --> 00:23:47,052
We'll be in friendly neighborhoods
before we hit the market...

262
00:23:47,194 --> 00:23:51,893
So remember the rules of engagement:
No one fires unless fired upon.

263
00:23:52,065 --> 00:23:54,329
Now, let's go get this thing done.

264
00:23:55,436 --> 00:23:57,063
Good luck, gentlemen.

265
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:04,944
What's the matter, Danny?
Something you don't like?

266
00:24:05,145 --> 00:24:07,340
No Spectre gunships,
daylight instead of night...

267
00:24:07,514 --> 00:24:10,005
Afternoon when they're
all fucked up on khat...

268
00:24:10,184 --> 00:24:14,348
Only part of the city Aidid can mount
a counter-attack on short notice....

269
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:17,622
What's not to like?
Life's imperfect.

270
00:24:17,825 --> 00:24:21,556
For you two, circling above it at 500 feet,
it's imperfect.

271
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:25,458
Down in the street, it's unforgiving.

272
00:25:01,635 --> 00:25:02,932
What the fuck, Smith?

273
00:25:03,904 --> 00:25:05,804
Well?
Well, what?

274
00:25:05,973 --> 00:25:07,440
We going?

275
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:12,575
Why should I tell you that?
Because I'm me.

276
00:25:13,914 --> 00:25:17,611
Yeah. 3:00. Downtown.

277
00:25:17,818 --> 00:25:19,342
Bakara market.
All right.

278
00:25:19,586 --> 00:25:23,420
Listen, Smith, I need you to back
me up out there today, all right?

279
00:25:23,624 --> 00:25:24,818
Keep sharp.

280
00:25:27,494 --> 00:25:29,621
Yes, sir, Sergeant Eversmann.

281
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,196
Ev, it's going to be nothing, man.

282
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:34,130
Nothing.

283
00:25:37,004 --> 00:25:42,340
It's all in the grind, Sizemore.
Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.

284
00:25:42,943 --> 00:25:45,138
This, my friend, is a science.

285
00:25:46,013 --> 00:25:48,846
You're looking at the guy
that believed the commercials.

286
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:51,176
About "be all you can be."

287
00:25:51,385 --> 00:25:54,183
I made coffee through Desert Storm.

288
00:25:54,488 --> 00:25:57,685
I made coffee through Panama,
while everyone else got to fight...

289
00:25:57,891 --> 00:25:59,722
Got to be a Ranger.

290
00:26:00,427 --> 00:26:05,262
Now it's "Grimesy, black, one sugar"
or "Grimesy, got a powdered anywhere?"

291
00:26:09,136 --> 00:26:11,627
What happened to you?
Ping-Pong accident.

292
00:26:12,005 --> 00:26:12,994
What?

293
00:26:13,974 --> 00:26:15,339
So guess what.

294
00:26:15,943 --> 00:26:18,741
Your wish has been granted.
You're going out today.

295
00:26:18,946 --> 00:26:20,573
You're fucking me.

296
00:26:20,814 --> 00:26:23,282
You're taking my place
assisting the 60 gunner.

297
00:26:23,483 --> 00:26:26,646
Sergeant Eversmann said to
get your stuff and get ready.

298
00:26:27,821 --> 00:26:29,789
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

299
00:26:29,957 --> 00:26:31,288
Oh, yeah.

300
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:34,151
Hell, yeah.

301
00:26:34,361 --> 00:26:38,024
Grimesy, stick with Waddell and
give him ammo when he needs it.

302
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:39,395
Hoo-ah?
Hoo-ah.

303
00:26:39,499 --> 00:26:43,993
I wouldn't worry about that.
Generally speaking, Somalis can't shoot for shit.

304
00:26:44,204 --> 00:26:48,140
Just watch out for the sammys
throwing the rocks, and you'll be fine.

305
00:26:48,342 --> 00:26:49,468
Might even be fun.

306
00:26:49,543 --> 00:26:53,445
D-boys do their thing now.
All we got to do is cover them.

307
00:26:53,513 --> 00:26:56,414
Choppers going to cover us,
and we'll be all right.

308
00:26:57,284 --> 00:27:01,152
Look, you guys,
this is my first time as chalk leader...

309
00:27:01,388 --> 00:27:04,789
But, this isn't our first time out together.
This is serious.

310
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:08,394
We're Rangers, not some sorry-ass JROTC.

311
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:10,224
We're elite.

312
00:27:10,931 --> 00:27:13,058
Let's act like it out there. Hoo-ah?

313
00:27:14,201 --> 00:27:15,896
Any questions?

314
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:23,970
We're going to be okay.

315
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:26,642
Grab your gear. Let's move out.

316
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,993
You're not going to need that, dude.
We're not out there long enough.

317
00:27:58,979 --> 00:28:00,378
You won't need that, either.

318
00:28:00,914 --> 00:28:02,814
We'll be back before dark.

319
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,610
You might as well take
dope and beer instead.

320
00:28:05,786 --> 00:28:07,083
What?

321
00:28:07,287 --> 00:28:09,221
Ammo, dude. Take ammo.

322
00:28:16,763 --> 00:28:20,130
Let me tell you something, Grimes.
You got 50 pounds of gear.

323
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:21,425
You don't need another 12.

324
00:28:21,568 --> 00:28:26,005
I don't know about you,
I don't plan on getting shot running away.

325
00:28:26,073 --> 00:28:27,597
Well, I better keep mine in.

326
00:28:27,808 --> 00:28:28,672
Grimes.

327
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:30,934
Most important thing:

328
00:28:31,078 --> 00:28:34,343
Remember, when everyone is shooting,
shoot in the same direction.

329
00:28:42,622 --> 00:28:46,319
Look at this.
He's taping his blood type to his boots.

330
00:28:46,493 --> 00:28:50,020
That's bad luck.
No, it's smart.

331
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:52,127
All Delta do that.

332
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:54,924
That's bad luck too, man.

333
00:28:55,435 --> 00:28:56,561
Come on, let's go.

334
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,973
It's a good thing you're
right-handed, Adonis.

335
00:29:05,112 --> 00:29:09,310
If not, I don't know what you'd do.
You're a funny guy, man.

336
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:13,749
I'm not taking no death letter.
We have a deal.

337
00:29:16,556 --> 00:29:18,547
I'll give it to you back in an hour.

338
00:29:18,792 --> 00:29:22,990
Blackburn, you okay?
Excited.

339
00:29:24,464 --> 00:29:27,956
In a good way.
I've been training my whole life for this.

340
00:29:28,335 --> 00:29:30,360
You ever shot at anybody before?

341
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:31,926
No, sir.

342
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,768
Me neither.

343
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:10,476
Think he's reliable?

344
00:30:10,544 --> 00:30:14,071
Well, we'll see.
It's his first time out.

345
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:24,623
Tell him to turn his damn radio off.
Yes, sir.

346
00:30:24,691 --> 00:30:26,522
Tell him to turn his radio off.

347
00:30:26,593 --> 00:30:29,585
Abdi, you need to turn your radio off.

348
00:30:35,902 --> 00:30:40,566
Hi. You've reached Stephanie and Randy,
leave us a message. Thank you.

349
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:45,343
Hey, baby, it's me. Are you there?

350
00:30:46,913 --> 00:30:48,904
Pick up if you're there.

351
00:30:49,783 --> 00:30:52,752
I'm just calling to make
sure everything's all right.

352
00:30:53,353 --> 00:30:55,787
I'll call you in a couple hours.

353
00:30:56,857 --> 00:30:58,757
You'd better not be sleeping.

354
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:01,056
Your move, Randy.

355
00:31:02,796 --> 00:31:04,320
I'm missing you.

356
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:07,128
I love you, baby.

357
00:31:08,568 --> 00:31:09,899
Hello? Hello?

358
00:31:12,138 --> 00:31:13,366
Thanks, bud.

359
00:31:15,742 --> 00:31:17,642
You know, it's kind of funny.

360
00:31:18,245 --> 00:31:21,373
Beautiful beach, beautiful sun.

361
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:25,014
Could almost be a good place to visit.

362
00:31:25,151 --> 00:31:26,550
Almost.

363
00:31:30,156 --> 00:31:32,283
You don't think we should be here.

364
00:31:33,226 --> 00:31:37,686
You know what I think?
It don't really matter what I think.

365
00:31:39,032 --> 00:31:43,401
Once that first bullet goes past your head,
politics and all that shit...

366
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,697
Just goes right out the window.

367
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:48,500
I just want to do it right today.

368
00:31:49,142 --> 00:31:52,976
Just watch your corner.
Get all your men back here alive.

369
00:32:18,204 --> 00:32:22,038
Now, is this supposed to be the place,
or did his car just take a dump?

370
00:32:22,242 --> 00:32:23,675
Abdi, come in.

371
00:32:24,177 --> 00:32:26,645
Abdi, can you hear me?
Is this the place?

372
00:32:30,984 --> 00:32:32,178
Abdi, come in.

373
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:40,084
Can you hear me? Abdi.

374
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,852
Abdi, come in.
Is this the place?

375
00:32:44,064 --> 00:32:46,532
To my right side, above the cafe.

376
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,164
He says this is the building.

377
00:32:49,402 --> 00:32:50,835
He's certain?

378
00:32:51,438 --> 00:32:53,269
Abdi, you need to be sure.

379
00:32:53,506 --> 00:32:54,871
Are you sure?

380
00:32:56,543 --> 00:33:00,877
Well, it's down the road,
two blocks over on my left.

381
00:33:01,815 --> 00:33:03,715
But there's too many militia.

382
00:33:04,284 --> 00:33:06,616
If I go closer, they might shoot me.

383
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:10,115
Now he's saying the building's
a couple blocks down...

384
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:12,689
But if he's seen outside it, he'll be shot.

385
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:15,654
I'll fucking shoot him myself.

386
00:33:15,862 --> 00:33:19,389
Tell him I want his skinny ass
parked in front of the building.

387
00:33:19,466 --> 00:33:22,629
He's not getting paid
till he does exactly that.

388
00:33:22,836 --> 00:33:26,033
Three miles to the target.
We're never off the main roads.

389
00:33:26,106 --> 00:33:29,303
At K-four traffic circle, we turn north,
then east on National...

390
00:33:29,376 --> 00:33:32,573
And we wait until extraction
of prisoners is complete here.

391
00:33:32,645 --> 00:33:34,613
Then we roll up in force on Hawlwadig...

392
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:38,208
Load the prisoners, the assault-blocking
forces and bring them back.

393
00:33:38,952 --> 00:33:41,113
Home in an hour. Okay?

394
00:33:41,321 --> 00:33:44,620
There will be some shooting.
Bakara market is the Wild West.

395
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:47,956
But be careful what you shoot at.
People do live there.

396
00:33:48,561 --> 00:33:49,823
Hoo-ah.

397
00:34:01,775 --> 00:34:05,973
Last one of these guys shot himself
in the head playing Russian roulette.

398
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:21,957
Sir, the vehicle is stopped.

399
00:34:22,762 --> 00:34:26,163
So this is the real deal now.
He's sure this time.

400
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:31,263
He sounds scared shitless.
Good. That's always a good sign.

401
00:34:42,682 --> 00:34:44,843
That's it. That's our signal.

402
00:34:45,018 --> 00:34:46,349
All right.

403
00:34:46,853 --> 00:34:49,617
All QRF out of the airspace.

404
00:34:51,024 --> 00:34:53,151
All QRF out of the airspace.

405
00:34:58,031 --> 00:35:02,491
All units, lrene. I say again, lrene.

406
00:35:10,043 --> 00:35:14,605
Check in when ready. Barber 51 up and ready.
Star 41 up and ready.

407
00:35:14,881 --> 00:35:16,075
Irene!

408
00:35:16,749 --> 00:35:18,216
Copy, Irene.

409
00:35:19,085 --> 00:35:20,382
Fucking Irene!

410
00:35:34,267 --> 00:35:35,097
Come on.

411
00:35:41,841 --> 00:35:43,001
Good luck, boys.

412
00:35:43,076 --> 00:35:44,509
Be careful.

413
00:35:44,911 --> 00:35:47,004
No one gets left behind.

414
00:35:48,915 --> 00:35:50,246
What's wrong?

415
00:35:51,084 --> 00:35:54,247
Nothing.
He's just never done that before.

416
00:35:55,255 --> 00:35:56,722
Aw, fuck!

417
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,020
Let's go.

418
00:36:03,029 --> 00:36:05,793
Sergeant Struecker.
Let's roll.

419
00:38:44,991 --> 00:38:46,322
Two minutes.

420
00:38:47,493 --> 00:38:48,926
Two minutes.

421
00:39:34,073 --> 00:39:36,667
Why are they burning tires?

422
00:39:36,976 --> 00:39:39,809
Signals to the militia
that we're coming!

423
00:39:41,981 --> 00:39:45,314
Okay, 56, looks like there's
some friendlies on the ground.

424
00:39:45,451 --> 00:39:48,443
Looks like I've got
a tally on the voice.

425
00:39:54,961 --> 00:39:56,258
One minute.

426
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,858
One minute.

427
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:04,600
What's that for?

428
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:08,874
Last rope, I almost bit my tongue off.

429
00:40:40,406 --> 00:40:41,771
Touching base.

430
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:47,238
Two feet, one foot...

431
00:40:49,015 --> 00:40:50,346
Clear.

432
00:40:51,451 --> 00:40:54,443
Little birds touching down at target.

433
00:41:39,031 --> 00:41:40,089
Ropes!

434
00:41:41,367 --> 00:41:43,858
Go! Go! Go!

435
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:54,573
Chalk One troops are on the deck.
Chalk Two deployed.

436
00:41:54,747 --> 00:41:58,080
This is McKnight.
Uniform 64 approaching staging area.

437
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:11,387
Down! Get down!

438
00:42:11,631 --> 00:42:13,360
Down! Stay down!

439
00:42:13,566 --> 00:42:15,295
Get down! Everybody down!

440
00:42:15,368 --> 00:42:16,801
You, down!

441
00:42:17,003 --> 00:42:18,027
Get down!

442
00:42:18,104 --> 00:42:19,128
On the floor.

443
00:42:25,478 --> 00:42:26,911
Let's go, let's go!

444
00:42:28,314 --> 00:42:30,680
Grimesy! No fear!

445
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:32,748
Oh, yeah, right!

446
00:42:36,489 --> 00:42:39,322
Rangers securing perimeter.
Four corners.

447
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:42,253
Colonel, they're shooting at us!

448
00:42:42,929 --> 00:42:44,920
Colonel, they're shooting at us!

449
00:42:44,997 --> 00:42:46,328
Well, shoot back!

450
00:42:50,136 --> 00:42:53,230
This is 64. Chalks on the ground,
going into holding pattern.

451
00:42:53,306 --> 00:42:56,104
This is 62, delivered chalks.
Going to cover pattern.

452
00:42:56,175 --> 00:43:00,271
Super 62, take up an overhead
pattern to provide sniper cover. Over.

453
00:43:00,446 --> 00:43:03,847
This is Super 65. Chalks on the ground,
going into holding pattern.

454
00:43:10,022 --> 00:43:13,150
Go, Blackburn, go! Go!

455
00:43:13,492 --> 00:43:14,754
Go, Blackburn!

456
00:43:17,263 --> 00:43:18,457
RPG!

457
00:43:18,664 --> 00:43:20,131
Hold on!

458
00:43:23,102 --> 00:43:24,296
No!

459
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,805
C-2, we got a man fallen.

460
00:43:37,416 --> 00:43:39,907
Super-61, you're a sitting duck.

461
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:43,516
Take up overhead pattern to
provide sniper cover. Over.

462
00:43:43,756 --> 00:43:46,020
Roger that. 61 coming out.

463
00:43:47,259 --> 00:43:51,593
13, go ahead. I need you to
move to the north of the street.

464
00:43:51,831 --> 00:43:54,425
Right to the north. Right there. Over.

465
00:43:55,735 --> 00:43:57,498
Doc! Doc Schmid!

466
00:43:57,903 --> 00:43:59,268
Come on!

467
00:43:59,505 --> 00:44:02,030
Schmid, we got a man hit.

468
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:06,945
Where's he hit?
He's not. He fell.

469
00:44:07,013 --> 00:44:08,981
What?
He fell.

470
00:44:12,218 --> 00:44:14,015
Why aren't you shooting?

471
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,051
We're not being shot at yet!

472
00:44:16,288 --> 00:44:17,687
How can you tell?

473
00:44:17,857 --> 00:44:19,449
A hiss means it's close.

474
00:44:19,525 --> 00:44:20,958
A snap means--

475
00:44:21,193 --> 00:44:22,990
Now they're shooting at us!

476
00:44:31,737 --> 00:44:32,965
Galentine!

477
00:44:36,809 --> 00:44:39,403
Get me Captain Steele!
Get me Captain Steele!

478
00:44:39,812 --> 00:44:43,111
Juliet 64, this is Juliet 25.
Come in. Over.

479
00:44:43,249 --> 00:44:45,080
Blackburn, can you hear me?

480
00:44:45,284 --> 00:44:48,412
Juliet 64, this is 25. Come in. Over.

481
00:44:48,721 --> 00:44:50,154
I can't get him!

482
00:44:51,157 --> 00:44:54,649
Juliet 64, this is Chalk Four!
We've got a man down!

483
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,751
We need to get him out of here! Over.

484
00:44:56,829 --> 00:44:59,923
This is 64. Say again, 25. Over.

485
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,191
We've got a man down! Over.

486
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:07,967
Take a breath, 25, and calm down. Over.

487
00:45:08,441 --> 00:45:11,137
Man down!
Missed that, 25.

488
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:13,041
Fuck it.
Say again.

489
00:45:13,112 --> 00:45:15,342
Matt, it's a long way to the humvees!

490
00:45:15,414 --> 00:45:18,815
We'll get a stretcher in here.
Get him to the target building.

491
00:45:19,051 --> 00:45:20,416
What did he say?

492
00:45:20,619 --> 00:45:24,453
Super 61, we got a man
wounded on the ground.

493
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:28,226
Stretcher!
Get me a stretcher!

494
00:45:28,461 --> 00:45:30,292
Come on. Stretcher.

495
00:45:30,463 --> 00:45:31,828
Come on, come on!

496
00:45:32,732 --> 00:45:34,290
Grab this end!

497
00:45:35,668 --> 00:45:37,295
Let's go!

498
00:45:38,137 --> 00:45:40,105
All right.
Go.

499
00:45:40,406 --> 00:45:42,874
Get him to the humvees.
We'll hold down the corner.

500
00:45:42,942 --> 00:45:44,739
Up to the humvees! Now!

501
00:45:48,314 --> 00:45:50,475
Go! Go!

502
00:45:52,351 --> 00:45:54,478
Keep moving, Grimes! Run!

503
00:45:59,325 --> 00:46:01,020
Secure!
Let's move out!

504
00:46:01,093 --> 00:46:03,288
Everybody up! Let's go!

505
00:46:03,529 --> 00:46:04,860
Come on!

506
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:06,591
Let's go! Let's move!

507
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:12,294
Grimes, run!
All right.

508
00:46:15,107 --> 00:46:19,043
C-2, this is Super 61,
beginning my orbit of the target area.

509
00:46:19,278 --> 00:46:22,543
Chalk Four, clear for a clear. Coming in.

510
00:46:23,816 --> 00:46:27,877
Kilo 11, this is 61,
providing cover for prisoner extract. Over.

511
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,815
Kilo 64, green light.

512
00:46:30,156 --> 00:46:33,455
Ready for extraction. Over.
Roger that. Will relay.

513
00:46:33,626 --> 00:46:35,958
That's it. We got them.

514
00:46:36,629 --> 00:46:39,530
Uniform 64, ready for extraction. Over.

515
00:46:39,932 --> 00:46:42,560
Roger that. There's the call.
Let's move out!

516
00:46:42,768 --> 00:46:44,599
Let's move out!
Hold on.

517
00:47:06,725 --> 00:47:09,319
How much longer?
Five minutes, sir.

518
00:47:09,395 --> 00:47:10,987
What?
Five minutes.

519
00:47:11,063 --> 00:47:12,690
Nothing takes five minutes!

520
00:47:18,204 --> 00:47:19,637
What happened to him?

521
00:47:19,705 --> 00:47:23,038
He fell! Missed the rope!
How'd he do that?

522
00:47:23,876 --> 00:47:27,039
Put him in that humvee!
Grimes, give him a hand!

523
00:47:27,479 --> 00:47:29,379
Let's go! Let's move it!

524
00:47:29,548 --> 00:47:31,709
Move, move! Come on! Move!

525
00:47:33,886 --> 00:47:35,251
Get him in there!

526
00:47:35,321 --> 00:47:36,811
Get ready to move!

527
00:47:37,389 --> 00:47:39,380
Go! Everybody move! Move!

528
00:47:40,259 --> 00:47:42,022
Get the fuck up!

529
00:47:42,561 --> 00:47:44,586
Grimes! Come on!

530
00:47:45,497 --> 00:47:47,158
Grimes! Grimes!

531
00:47:55,074 --> 00:47:56,837
Fuck this!

532
00:48:20,032 --> 00:48:21,192
Fuck!

533
00:48:26,906 --> 00:48:28,100
Let's go.

534
00:48:28,707 --> 00:48:29,901
Come on!

535
00:48:30,709 --> 00:48:32,142
Go! Move it!

536
00:48:32,378 --> 00:48:33,367
Move!

537
00:48:33,545 --> 00:48:36,742
Romeo 64, I need to send out
three humvees with a casualty.

538
00:48:36,815 --> 00:48:38,874
He looks real bad.
I need to evac now.

539
00:48:39,051 --> 00:48:40,416
Roger that, Uniform 64.

540
00:48:40,653 --> 00:48:43,178
We'll chop a team of gun ships to you.
Over.

541
00:48:43,255 --> 00:48:44,813
Roger that.

542
00:48:45,257 --> 00:48:47,487
I need extra security on these humvees!

543
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:50,653
I'll go. I'll take my team,
make sure they get back okay.

544
00:48:50,729 --> 00:48:51,753
Do it.

545
00:48:51,997 --> 00:48:54,056
Struecker, you're lead humvee.

546
00:48:59,104 --> 00:49:02,335
First three vehicles mount up,
we're moving back to base.

547
00:49:03,676 --> 00:49:04,938
Move out!

548
00:49:22,294 --> 00:49:24,785
How are things going?
Things okay there, Struecker?

549
00:49:24,863 --> 00:49:27,127
I don't want to talk
about it now, Colonel!

550
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:28,564
I'm busy.

551
00:49:57,162 --> 00:49:58,754
Sergeant Pilla's hit!

552
00:49:59,832 --> 00:50:01,732
Christ, he's fucked up!

553
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,265
Is anyone hit?

554
00:50:03,736 --> 00:50:05,169
Struecker, talk to me!

555
00:50:05,237 --> 00:50:06,932
It's Sergeant Pilla!

556
00:50:07,406 --> 00:50:08,930
What's his status?

557
00:50:09,908 --> 00:50:11,307
What's his status?

558
00:50:11,944 --> 00:50:13,241
He's dead.

559
00:50:14,279 --> 00:50:15,576
He's dead.

560
00:50:15,748 --> 00:50:17,238
Pilla's dead, sir.

561
00:50:19,585 --> 00:50:24,522
C-2, this is McKnight.
We have a KIA Dominick Pilla. Over.

562
00:50:25,024 --> 00:50:26,514
Roger that.

563
00:50:27,192 --> 00:50:29,183
Get on that 50!

564
00:50:29,428 --> 00:50:31,623
Someone get on that 50!

565
00:50:31,864 --> 00:50:33,263
It's mine.

566
00:51:19,578 --> 00:51:22,843
Three guys with RPGs,
coming up on your side now!

567
00:51:30,089 --> 00:51:31,454
Stay with it!

568
00:51:32,424 --> 00:51:35,120
This is 61. I'm hit. I'm hit.

569
00:51:35,794 --> 00:51:40,094
Super 61 is hit. He is hit.
Wolcott's bird is hit.

570
00:51:42,367 --> 00:51:44,927
You want to pull those
PCLs off-line or what?

571
00:51:45,137 --> 00:51:46,434
Right, babe.

572
00:51:47,439 --> 00:51:48,428
Come on.

573
00:51:55,447 --> 00:51:56,778
61, going down.

574
00:51:56,949 --> 00:51:58,211
61 going down.

575
00:51:58,283 --> 00:52:00,717
61 is going down.

576
00:52:02,154 --> 00:52:04,486
Super 61 is going down.

577
00:52:05,023 --> 00:52:06,991
Super 61 is going down.

578
00:52:07,226 --> 00:52:10,059
61 is going down.
I repeat, it's going down.

579
00:52:10,229 --> 00:52:12,026
61's going down.

580
00:52:14,399 --> 00:52:15,923
Hold on!

581
00:52:38,557 --> 00:52:41,424
We got a Black Hawk down.
We got a Black Hawk down.

582
00:52:42,761 --> 00:52:45,924
Super 61 is down.
We got a bird down in the city.

583
00:52:46,131 --> 00:52:48,099
Super 61 is on the deck now.

584
00:52:49,101 --> 00:52:51,695
Get an MH-six on site.
Check for survivors.

585
00:52:51,937 --> 00:52:53,768
Send in the SAR bird.

586
00:52:53,972 --> 00:52:57,738
I want ground forces to move and secure
a new perimeter around that crash site.

587
00:52:57,809 --> 00:52:59,868
Can you guide the convoy in there?

588
00:52:59,945 --> 00:53:01,071
Roger that.

589
00:53:01,146 --> 00:53:02,477
Well, move quick.

590
00:53:03,582 --> 00:53:06,050
The whole city will be
coming down on top of them.

591
00:53:06,885 --> 00:53:10,719
Star 41, come inbound and see if
you can land at the crash site.

592
00:53:10,923 --> 00:53:13,255
Roger that. Star 41 inbound.

593
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:27,067
We just lost the initiative.

594
00:53:33,845 --> 00:53:35,278
25, this is 64. Over.

595
00:53:35,914 --> 00:53:37,279
25. Over.

596
00:53:37,916 --> 00:53:41,181
25, Chalk Four is closest to the crash site.
Over.

597
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:43,911
64, I can't see the crash site. Over.

598
00:53:44,756 --> 00:53:47,418
25, it's due east of you. You will find it.

599
00:53:47,593 --> 00:53:51,393
Leave a security element in place.
Take the rest of your chalk to the crash.

600
00:53:51,463 --> 00:53:54,830
Check for survivors. Secure the area.
All other chalks will follow.

601
00:53:57,436 --> 00:53:59,529
25, do you read me? Over.

602
00:54:00,205 --> 00:54:02,537
Galentine! Schmid!

603
00:54:02,708 --> 00:54:03,800
Get Yurek.

604
00:54:04,042 --> 00:54:05,304
Get Twombly.

605
00:54:05,577 --> 00:54:07,875
Hey, there's a Black Hawk down.

606
00:54:08,046 --> 00:54:09,843
Twombly, Nelson, stay here.

607
00:54:09,982 --> 00:54:12,883
Hold this corner and then
exfil with the humvees.

608
00:54:13,085 --> 00:54:16,919
Galentine, Schmid, you're coming with me.
Let's go.

609
00:54:17,422 --> 00:54:19,515
How come I got to stay back here?

610
00:54:19,658 --> 00:54:21,387
Because you're dependable.

611
00:54:22,561 --> 00:54:23,823
All right...

612
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:26,861
Let's go!

613
00:54:32,104 --> 00:54:34,004
I hate being dependable, man.

614
00:54:48,453 --> 00:54:51,980
Juliet 25, hostiles advancing,
parallel west to your position.

615
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:54,354
Women and children among them. Over.

616
00:54:54,459 --> 00:54:55,687
Hit the wall.

617
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:13,710
Incoming!

618
00:55:19,384 --> 00:55:20,817
Grenade!

619
00:55:36,902 --> 00:55:38,096
Go.

620
00:55:48,814 --> 00:55:50,941
We still got guys inside!

621
00:55:51,149 --> 00:55:52,741
I'll go to the crash.

622
00:55:52,951 --> 00:55:56,751
You take the rest of the team.
I'll finish loading the prisoners.

623
00:55:56,922 --> 00:55:59,254
No! We'll go to the crash site together.

624
00:55:59,324 --> 00:56:01,554
Secure the perimeter,
wait for the humvees.

625
00:56:01,626 --> 00:56:03,457
Roger that.
Follow my lead.

626
00:56:04,029 --> 00:56:06,122
Sarg'nt, are you receiving me?

627
00:56:06,198 --> 00:56:08,860
Yeah, I heard you.
We should be leaving soon.

628
00:56:10,736 --> 00:56:13,534
All right, we need to move out now!

629
00:56:13,605 --> 00:56:16,836
I'll finish loading the prisoners
and pick you up at the crash site!

630
00:56:16,908 --> 00:56:18,136
Let's move out!

631
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:19,609
Moving out! Go!

632
00:56:26,752 --> 00:56:28,720
Get in! Get in!

633
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,182
Move!

634
00:56:43,635 --> 00:56:45,159
Eight o'clock!

635
00:56:59,151 --> 00:57:01,449
Grimes, stay away from the walls.

636
00:57:16,368 --> 00:57:18,700
Grimes. You okay?

637
00:57:19,037 --> 00:57:20,299
Yeah!

638
00:57:22,374 --> 00:57:23,739
Let's go, Maddox.

639
00:57:24,209 --> 00:57:26,541
C-2, convoy's moving out.
Roger that.

640
00:57:26,711 --> 00:57:29,339
Maddox, look at these jerks!
These idiots!

641
00:57:29,581 --> 00:57:32,141
Go, go! Right, Maddox, right!

642
00:57:41,726 --> 00:57:44,217
Twombly, the convoy is leaving!

643
00:57:44,596 --> 00:57:46,393
Hey, Twombly!

644
00:57:47,232 --> 00:57:48,221
What?

645
00:57:48,433 --> 00:57:50,924
I think they've forgotten us.
What?

646
00:57:51,136 --> 00:57:52,626
It doesn't matter.

647
00:58:00,345 --> 00:58:05,112
63 confirm. Skinnies are moving in on all sides.
They need help now.

648
00:58:06,418 --> 00:58:10,184
Indigenous personnel advancing
to Wolcott crash site.

649
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:12,852
Say again. Over.

650
00:58:12,924 --> 00:58:15,222
A lot of people closing in.

651
00:58:17,529 --> 00:58:20,123
How far is Chalk Four
from the crash site?

652
00:58:20,365 --> 00:58:23,459
Six blocks, sir.
They need to haul ass.

653
00:59:17,222 --> 00:59:19,190
Get down! Get down!

654
00:59:20,292 --> 00:59:21,987
Scotty, are you okay?

655
00:59:24,029 --> 00:59:25,496
No, don't go back!

656
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,265
Get down! Get down!

657
00:59:39,678 --> 00:59:40,975
Technicals!

658
00:59:41,313 --> 00:59:42,803
Got them!

659
00:59:50,021 --> 00:59:51,818
Six o'clock! Move, move!

660
01:00:13,845 --> 01:00:15,836
Go, go, go!

661
01:00:21,419 --> 01:00:22,613
Go, go!

662
01:00:25,957 --> 01:00:27,424
Come on!

663
01:00:35,934 --> 01:00:37,629
Yurek, leaving!

664
01:00:40,605 --> 01:00:41,765
Come on!

665
01:02:09,227 --> 01:02:12,856
Uniform 64, left turn. Left turn.

666
01:02:13,398 --> 01:02:17,425
Romeo 64, I need to know before
I get to the goddamn street!

667
01:02:17,635 --> 01:02:20,229
You have to slow down. There's a delay.

668
01:02:20,438 --> 01:02:25,034
From the time directions are relayed
from surveillance to JOC, then to me.

669
01:02:25,310 --> 01:02:28,143
We can't slow down!
We're taking heavy enemy fire!

670
01:02:28,279 --> 01:02:30,008
We can't slow down!

671
01:02:30,081 --> 01:02:33,949
Danny, I'm getting information
from Orion surveillance above.

672
01:02:34,152 --> 01:02:36,882
So get me my fucking
directions to the crash site!

673
01:02:36,955 --> 01:02:40,982
Danny, hold on. I no longer have
the best view of your route.

674
01:02:41,259 --> 01:02:43,750
Get your ass in the right place,
goddamn it!

675
01:02:43,928 --> 01:02:47,227
What in the hell is the
status of Struecker's humvees?

676
01:02:47,332 --> 01:02:50,267
Colonel Harrell, ETA to base,
Struecker's column.

677
01:02:50,435 --> 01:02:53,097
ETA to base momentarily.

678
01:02:59,944 --> 01:03:01,377
Open the gate!

679
01:03:23,134 --> 01:03:25,728
Get him out! Let's go! Let's go!
Come on.

680
01:03:28,406 --> 01:03:29,839
Watch his head.

681
01:03:29,908 --> 01:03:31,273
Easy.

682
01:03:39,184 --> 01:03:41,948
Blackburn, can you hear me?
Get him to a medic.

683
01:04:16,454 --> 01:04:19,981
Star 41 is at the crash site
to evacuate the injured. Over.

684
01:04:20,058 --> 01:04:21,150
Roger that.

685
01:05:00,498 --> 01:05:01,863
I got you.

686
01:05:02,433 --> 01:05:03,627
Easy.

687
01:05:10,842 --> 01:05:12,707
Galentine, you all right?

688
01:05:12,844 --> 01:05:16,610
Galentine, Kurth, with me!
Cover fire, now.

689
01:05:16,681 --> 01:05:18,308
Full cover!

690
01:05:32,797 --> 01:05:34,128
How many are in there?

691
01:05:34,198 --> 01:05:36,962
Two pilots are dead,
two crew chiefs are wounded!

692
01:05:37,168 --> 01:05:40,660
He's hurt bad. We must get out of here.
All right. Go ahead.

693
01:06:13,004 --> 01:06:16,701
26, this is 25.
Is that you shooting up the technicals?

694
01:06:17,775 --> 01:06:19,367
This is 26. Roger that.

695
01:06:19,444 --> 01:06:23,540
DiTomasso, take the southeast corner.
We're setting up a perimeter. Over.

696
01:06:23,781 --> 01:06:26,443
This is 26. Roger that.
Moving there now.

697
01:06:26,651 --> 01:06:27,948
Move out!

698
01:06:30,688 --> 01:06:33,088
Captain Steele, come in.

699
01:06:34,792 --> 01:06:36,657
Go ahead, 25. This is 64.

700
01:06:37,028 --> 01:06:41,658
We got two wounded and we got both
the pilots dead in the chopper!

701
01:06:42,033 --> 01:06:43,625
We need a medivac now!

702
01:06:44,102 --> 01:06:49,438
It's too hot to land a bird.
You must secure the perimeter first. Over.

703
01:06:50,241 --> 01:06:51,435
Where are the humvees?

704
01:06:51,509 --> 01:06:54,478
Be advised, 25, the convoy will be there.

705
01:06:54,545 --> 01:06:57,673
They're encountering a lot of resistance.
64 out.

706
01:07:09,761 --> 01:07:13,458
Get the 50 up!
You should see the crash directly ahead.

707
01:07:13,664 --> 01:07:16,132
All I see is a roadblock!

708
01:07:17,268 --> 01:07:19,702
I'll have to figure out another way.

709
01:07:44,996 --> 01:07:48,193
Give me a defensive perimeter
so we can load the wounded.

710
01:08:08,352 --> 01:08:10,047
Fire your weapon, Othic!

711
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:25,263
Tell my girls I'll be okay.

712
01:08:34,612 --> 01:08:36,170
Medic!

713
01:08:36,948 --> 01:08:38,108
Hoo-ah!

714
01:09:06,911 --> 01:09:08,902
Medic! Medic!

715
01:09:09,514 --> 01:09:13,610
Joyce! Joyce!
Come on, help me pick him up!

716
01:09:15,086 --> 01:09:19,420
Get us off this fucking street!
Where's the crash site? Say again.

717
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:22,753
Keep going straight 200 meters.

718
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,086
Roger that.

719
01:09:25,663 --> 01:09:26,960
Let's go!

720
01:09:27,498 --> 01:09:29,489
Let's go, goddamn it, let's go!

721
01:09:47,785 --> 01:09:50,310
Hey, Twombles. Come here.

722
01:09:54,525 --> 01:09:56,823
The humvees ain't coming back, dude.

723
01:09:57,461 --> 01:09:58,553
What?

724
01:09:59,964 --> 01:10:01,864
Were we supposed to go to them?

725
01:10:01,933 --> 01:10:04,026
I thought they were coming to us.

726
01:10:06,304 --> 01:10:08,829
I think we're supposed to go to them.
Shit.

727
01:10:12,176 --> 01:10:13,734
Let's go to the crash site.

728
01:10:13,811 --> 01:10:14,800
Okay.

729
01:10:14,979 --> 01:10:18,415
Don't fire that thing so close to my head.
I can barely hear as it is.

730
01:10:18,482 --> 01:10:19,471
Move out.

731
01:10:32,563 --> 01:10:34,190
Shit! Get down!

732
01:10:36,334 --> 01:10:39,826
What did I just tell you?
If you do that again--

733
01:10:44,175 --> 01:10:46,200
You okay? Nelson.

734
01:10:46,844 --> 01:10:49,176
You all right?

735
01:10:49,714 --> 01:10:52,842
Search and rescue bird on station
inserting medics.

736
01:11:04,662 --> 01:11:05,651
Go!

737
01:11:10,134 --> 01:11:11,624
Go, go!

738
01:11:14,005 --> 01:11:17,463
Son of a bitch. C-2, this is 68.
We've been hit.

739
01:11:17,642 --> 01:11:20,975
Super 68, there is smoke coming
from the top of your rotor.

740
01:11:21,178 --> 01:11:23,305
Advise you to come out now.
Roger.

741
01:11:23,814 --> 01:11:25,213
Dropping last man.

742
01:11:27,818 --> 01:11:32,050
Art, I've got skinnies with RPGs at 12:00.
Can you see them?

743
01:11:32,323 --> 01:11:34,484
Got them. Give me 90 degrees left.

744
01:11:44,568 --> 01:11:45,830
68 coming out.

745
01:11:47,838 --> 01:11:50,204
Super 68 is out. Over.

746
01:12:00,117 --> 01:12:02,677
Hey, Wilkie, what's the situation in there?

747
01:12:02,953 --> 01:12:04,784
Both pilots are dead.

748
01:12:05,623 --> 01:12:08,717
25, we can't move these guys, Matty.

749
01:12:08,893 --> 01:12:10,724
We'll kill them just carrying them.

750
01:12:10,795 --> 01:12:13,195
Stabilize in here?
Roger.

751
01:12:13,564 --> 01:12:16,692
Stabilize in the bird.
Repeat: Stabilize in here. Over.

752
01:12:16,801 --> 01:12:18,894
Understood, Wilkie.
We got you covered. Over.

753
01:12:18,969 --> 01:12:22,461
Super 64, come inbound and
take Wolcott's position.

754
01:12:23,407 --> 01:12:25,739
Roger. 64 is inbound.

755
01:12:52,903 --> 01:12:54,495
Super 64, you all right?

756
01:12:54,572 --> 01:12:57,370
This is Super 64. We're good.

757
01:12:57,575 --> 01:13:00,442
You sure?
You look like you got clipped pretty good.

758
01:13:00,644 --> 01:13:02,635
Instrument panels are okay.

759
01:13:02,947 --> 01:13:06,781
No, we're good. Got a slight vibration
in the pedals, but we're good.

760
01:13:07,618 --> 01:13:11,987
All right, put her down on the airfield, 64.
Have it checked out just to be safe.

761
01:13:12,456 --> 01:13:13,445
Roger.

762
01:13:16,127 --> 01:13:20,291
I'm getting movement in these pedals.
Check the systems again.

763
01:13:35,479 --> 01:13:37,970
We lost the tail rotor! It's gone!

764
01:13:38,149 --> 01:13:39,844
64 is going down!

765
01:13:40,985 --> 01:13:42,509
64 is going in hard.

766
01:13:44,355 --> 01:13:46,084
64 going down.

767
01:13:50,995 --> 01:13:52,860
We're going down.

768
01:13:57,835 --> 01:13:59,735
Get Struecker's column back out there.

769
01:13:59,804 --> 01:14:02,102
They need to get to
Durant's crash site fast.

770
01:14:02,173 --> 01:14:04,801
Another bird down.
I want them out of there.

771
01:14:05,509 --> 01:14:06,476
All of them.

772
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:13,943
Captain Steele, we got to
move or we'll get pinned down!

773
01:14:14,218 --> 01:14:16,209
We're moving as fast as we can.

774
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:19,483
You let me do my job and you do yours.
Over.

775
01:14:28,132 --> 01:14:30,623
Fuck! Fuck!
Ruiz stay down.

776
01:14:30,701 --> 01:14:31,861
I fucking knew--
Medic.

777
01:14:31,936 --> 01:14:35,702
Fuck this! Captain Steele,
I'll take out the threat in the window.

778
01:14:35,973 --> 01:14:38,237
We'll rally at the gray building.
Coming through.

779
01:14:38,309 --> 01:14:38,832
Sarg'nt!

780
01:14:39,076 --> 01:14:40,236
All right, let's move!

781
01:14:46,083 --> 01:14:47,380
Cover me!

782
01:14:53,224 --> 01:14:55,886
Let's go, let's move!
Moving out.

783
01:15:01,599 --> 01:15:02,122
Friendly!

784
01:15:02,199 --> 01:15:03,928
Friendlies coming through!

785
01:15:04,001 --> 01:15:06,367
Let's go, let's go! Move up!

786
01:15:06,604 --> 01:15:08,504
Come on, come on!

787
01:15:09,006 --> 01:15:10,030
Come on!

788
01:15:17,715 --> 01:15:19,410
Move up! Go! Move up!

789
01:15:19,817 --> 01:15:21,546
What the fuck are you doing out there?

790
01:15:21,619 --> 01:15:24,315
Doing my job!
We got to get to that crash site!

791
01:15:24,655 --> 01:15:27,453
We got to get on that street,
and we got to move!

792
01:15:27,892 --> 01:15:29,985
And you have got to keep up, sir!

793
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,321
Don't you ever give me orders, Sergeant.

794
01:15:32,396 --> 01:15:34,864
We are combat ineffective, understand?

795
01:15:35,466 --> 01:15:36,990
We got too many wounded to move!

796
01:15:37,067 --> 01:15:40,298
Then give me some shooters
and I'll circle us to the bird.

797
01:15:43,007 --> 01:15:45,498
Grimes! You're with Chalk Four?

798
01:15:45,676 --> 01:15:46,700
Yes, sir!

799
01:15:46,911 --> 01:15:50,347
All right, hook up with Delta!
Rejoin with Sergeant Eversmann.

800
01:15:50,915 --> 01:15:53,179
The rest of you, secure this position!

801
01:15:53,384 --> 01:15:55,614
Treat the wounded,
we'll wait for the convoy!

802
01:15:55,686 --> 01:15:58,211
Then we'll rally at
the crash site. Roger!

803
01:15:58,422 --> 01:15:59,787
My guys, let's go!

804
01:16:30,721 --> 01:16:33,713
C-2, I have two Delta snipers,
Shughart and Gordon...

805
01:16:33,791 --> 01:16:36,487
Volunteering to secure crash site two.
Over.

806
01:16:37,127 --> 01:16:41,291
No, Super 62, negative that request.
Can't risk another bird.

807
01:16:43,133 --> 01:16:47,069
We don't see anything moving down there,
we don't even know if anyone's alive.

808
01:16:48,339 --> 01:16:51,069
A ground team is being
organized to go in now.

809
01:16:51,241 --> 01:16:52,970
ETA on ground team? Over.

810
01:16:53,143 --> 01:16:56,237
Unknown, not long.

811
01:16:56,413 --> 01:16:58,745
Do what you can from the air.

812
01:17:02,753 --> 01:17:04,516
All right, gather around!

813
01:17:04,655 --> 01:17:07,886
Durant's 64 is down.
We're going back in to get him!

814
01:17:07,958 --> 01:17:10,085
That's crazy. Is there anyone alive?

815
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:12,560
Doesn't matter, no one gets left behind.

816
01:17:12,796 --> 01:17:14,991
We're wasting time here.

817
01:17:15,165 --> 01:17:18,191
Refit and max out ammo and grenades,
you got five!

818
01:17:19,436 --> 01:17:21,267
Sizemore, where are you going?

819
01:17:21,338 --> 01:17:24,171
With you guys.
Not with that cast on you're not.

820
01:17:25,042 --> 01:17:28,341
All right, all right, all right.
Go get your k-pot.

821
01:17:30,614 --> 01:17:31,808
Talk to me.

822
01:17:32,116 --> 01:17:33,481
I can't go back out there.

823
01:17:33,550 --> 01:17:38,112
Thomas, everyone feels the
same way you do. All right?

824
01:17:38,322 --> 01:17:41,519
It's what you do right now
that makes a difference.

825
01:17:42,559 --> 01:17:44,049
It's your call.

826
01:17:44,495 --> 01:17:45,553
Hoo-ah?

827
01:17:51,735 --> 01:17:52,963
Hoo-ah.

828
01:18:09,319 --> 01:18:12,948
It'll probably help to wash
the blood out of the humvees.

829
01:18:21,932 --> 01:18:23,866
Sergeant Struecker!

830
01:18:24,535 --> 01:18:27,868
Sergeant Struecker! Can I go, Sarge?

831
01:18:28,305 --> 01:18:30,205
You got some ammo?
Roger, Sarge!

832
01:18:30,374 --> 01:18:31,966
Hop in!

833
01:18:49,993 --> 01:18:51,358
Wait!

834
01:18:52,296 --> 01:18:54,457
Let's go, Thomas. Get in!

835
01:19:18,255 --> 01:19:19,415
Which way?

836
01:19:24,428 --> 01:19:27,420
That way, I think!
Not so fucking loud.

837
01:20:01,198 --> 01:20:02,529
Nice donkey.

838
01:20:21,151 --> 01:20:22,550
Rangers?

839
01:20:23,053 --> 01:20:24,042
Who?

840
01:20:24,888 --> 01:20:28,449
It's Yurek! You fucking assholes!

841
01:20:28,625 --> 01:20:30,024
Fuck!

842
01:20:30,227 --> 01:20:32,787
Dude, we almost fucking killed you!

843
01:20:33,030 --> 01:20:36,124
Come to us!
Fuck you, come to me.

844
01:20:48,579 --> 01:20:49,910
Sorry, Sarge!

845
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:52,014
Dude, where the fuck have you been?

846
01:20:52,082 --> 01:20:53,947
Never mind, you brought NOD, right?

847
01:20:54,017 --> 01:20:56,349
No, I didn't and you want to know why?

848
01:20:56,420 --> 01:20:59,787
Because you said: "You won't need that,
we'll be back in a half-hour."

849
01:20:59,857 --> 01:21:01,415
Well, I wasn't saying it to you.

850
01:21:01,491 --> 01:21:03,482
Nelson, cover this way.

851
01:21:03,861 --> 01:21:05,453
We'll need night vision.

852
01:21:05,529 --> 01:21:07,929
What's the matter with you?

853
01:21:08,298 --> 01:21:11,062
Oh, he's deaf. It's my fault.

854
01:21:11,368 --> 01:21:13,632
We need to get out of here!
That way.

855
01:21:13,704 --> 01:21:17,367
We can't be far from the crash.
Which way?

856
01:21:18,041 --> 01:21:19,770
I thought you might know.

857
01:21:20,510 --> 01:21:21,943
Let's move out.

858
01:21:27,517 --> 01:21:30,077
Nelson, Twombly?
Come in. Over.

859
01:21:31,154 --> 01:21:35,352
Nelson, Twombly, this is Galentine.
We need a position of the convoy. Over.

860
01:21:36,393 --> 01:21:38,657
I can't raise them, Sergeant.

861
01:21:38,896 --> 01:21:41,558
Sir, let's get the fuck
out of here and evac!

862
01:21:43,033 --> 01:21:46,093
Let's move out.
Back to the stronghold!

863
01:21:46,336 --> 01:21:47,325
Come on!

864
01:21:49,606 --> 01:21:52,837
Ground forces have occupied several
buildings along Marehan Road...

865
01:21:52,910 --> 01:21:54,605
But they're all spread out.

866
01:21:54,678 --> 01:21:59,115
Eversmann's Chalk Four has set up a
perimeter around Wolcott's crash site.

867
01:21:59,349 --> 01:22:01,681
DiTomasso is in the adjacent structure.

868
01:22:02,052 --> 01:22:05,988
Captain Steele and about 40 men, Rangers,
are here, a couple blocks away.

869
01:22:06,056 --> 01:22:07,580
They're banged up pretty bad.

870
01:22:07,658 --> 01:22:12,527
He set up a casualty collection point,
I don't think they'll be able to move.

871
01:22:12,763 --> 01:22:15,254
Sergeant Sanderson and
a small Delta team...

872
01:22:15,332 --> 01:22:19,200
Are moving from Steele's position
to the crash site as we speak.

873
01:22:30,213 --> 01:22:31,373
Draw off fire!

874
01:22:31,448 --> 01:22:34,508
When this asshole stops
to reload, cover me!

875
01:22:34,718 --> 01:22:36,151
Go!
Sir.

876
01:22:39,656 --> 01:22:40,623
Again!

877
01:22:45,729 --> 01:22:47,196
Loading!

878
01:22:49,566 --> 01:22:51,056
Keep going!

879
01:22:51,802 --> 01:22:53,531
I'm jammed!

880
01:22:54,705 --> 01:22:56,172
I got it!

881
01:22:57,407 --> 01:22:59,170
No, shit!

882
01:23:11,755 --> 01:23:13,017
RPG!

883
01:23:27,971 --> 01:23:30,531
You all right? You okay?

884
01:23:30,707 --> 01:23:33,676
Yeah. I can hear bells ringing.

885
01:23:35,278 --> 01:23:37,508
Come on! Come on!

886
01:23:39,249 --> 01:23:40,238
Go!

887
01:23:47,457 --> 01:23:50,426
A crowd is advancing six,
seven blocks from the crash.

888
01:23:50,527 --> 01:23:52,825
Shughart and Gordon again
request permission...

889
01:23:52,896 --> 01:23:56,332
To secure until convoy arrives. Over.

890
01:23:56,533 --> 01:23:59,593
General, crowds are in the hundreds now.

891
01:23:59,836 --> 01:24:03,294
From where they are,
they can see things clearer than any of us.

892
01:24:03,407 --> 01:24:05,307
They know what they're asking.

893
01:24:05,509 --> 01:24:06,976
Let me talk to them.

894
01:24:07,177 --> 01:24:08,269
This is Garrison.

895
01:24:08,345 --> 01:24:12,611
I want to make sure that you understand
what you're asking, so say it out loud.

896
01:24:14,684 --> 01:24:18,677
We're asking to go in and set up a
perimeter until ground support arrives.

897
01:24:19,022 --> 01:24:23,186
You realize that I cannot tell you when
that might be, it could take a while.

898
01:24:24,094 --> 01:24:26,619
Roger that.
You still want to go in there?

899
01:24:26,963 --> 01:24:27,759
Yes, sir.

900
01:24:31,768 --> 01:24:33,395
Colonel Harrell?
Yes, General?

901
01:24:33,470 --> 01:24:34,528
It's your call.

902
01:24:35,705 --> 01:24:37,195
Roger that.

903
01:24:38,975 --> 01:24:41,170
Goffena, put them in.

904
01:24:55,092 --> 01:24:56,855
Motherfucker. Motherfucker.

905
01:25:02,032 --> 01:25:03,021
RPG!

906
01:25:12,909 --> 01:25:14,501
Set up your perimeter!

907
01:25:21,952 --> 01:25:23,943
There's a fucking rocket in him, sir!

908
01:25:24,020 --> 01:25:27,888
Othic, calm down, goddamn it!
There's live ordnance, now get out!

909
01:25:29,192 --> 01:25:31,023
Son of a bitch.

910
01:25:32,529 --> 01:25:35,692
All right, lift him up!
Lift him up! Easy, easy!

911
01:25:35,999 --> 01:25:39,093
All right, get him in there! Good, good!
Easy, easy!

912
01:25:40,303 --> 01:25:41,827
Get in that truck and drive.

913
01:25:41,905 --> 01:25:43,964
But I'm shot, Colonel.
Everybody's shot.

914
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:46,133
We need the prisoners! Let's go!

915
01:25:47,210 --> 01:25:50,702
Surveillance says to take Hawlwadig,
then go straight.

916
01:25:50,947 --> 01:25:55,213
McKnight, we need you to turn
around and head back to Hawlwadig.

917
01:25:55,385 --> 01:25:57,649
You're shitting me!
We just came through there!

918
01:25:57,721 --> 01:25:59,484
There must be a better route!

919
01:25:59,556 --> 01:26:04,721
That's the info I'm getting from JOC,
you need to turn around and head back.

920
01:26:05,996 --> 01:26:08,021
Roger that. Roger that.

921
01:26:08,498 --> 01:26:11,365
I cannot believe this shit!
Turn us around, Maddox.

922
01:26:11,434 --> 01:26:13,402
They're trying to get us fucking killed!

923
01:26:13,470 --> 01:26:15,062
Just get it over with! Drive!

924
01:26:15,138 --> 01:26:16,127
Goddamn!

925
01:26:16,406 --> 01:26:18,738
Get us out of here, goddamn it, drive!

926
01:26:26,449 --> 01:26:27,882
Keep your foot on the gas!

927
01:26:27,951 --> 01:26:30,181
Keep your foot on the gas!

928
01:26:41,698 --> 01:26:42,756
Fuck!

929
01:26:45,702 --> 01:26:46,691
Shit.

930
01:27:02,152 --> 01:27:04,916
C-2, Shughart and Gordon
are on the deck. Over.

931
01:27:05,121 --> 01:27:06,088
Roger.

932
01:27:32,182 --> 01:27:33,740
Friendlies!

933
01:27:35,919 --> 01:27:37,147
God, it's good to see you!

934
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:39,188
It's good to see you. How bad?

935
01:27:39,256 --> 01:27:42,157
My leg's broken and my
back feels kind of weird.

936
01:27:42,292 --> 01:27:44,385
We've got to get you out of here.

937
01:27:45,362 --> 01:27:47,193
I'm pulling him out! Cover!

938
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:51,589
Wait, l--

939
01:28:00,143 --> 01:28:01,405
I'm putting you down.

940
01:28:01,645 --> 01:28:04,580
C-2, we're at the 64 crash site,
securing perimeter.

941
01:28:04,648 --> 01:28:06,240
You all right?
Yeah, I'm good.

942
01:28:06,316 --> 01:28:07,749
You're locked and loaded.

943
01:28:07,817 --> 01:28:11,548
Any skinnies come around these corners,
you watch our backs.

944
01:28:11,621 --> 01:28:14,283
Where's the rescue squad?
We're it.

945
01:28:19,996 --> 01:28:23,090
All right, stop, stop, Maddox. Stop.

946
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:25,567
Son of a bitch.

947
01:28:25,669 --> 01:28:28,536
Romeo 64, we're back where we started.

948
01:28:28,772 --> 01:28:31,468
I'm low on ammo,
I got many wounded including me...

949
01:28:31,541 --> 01:28:33,509
Vehicles that are barely running.

950
01:28:33,576 --> 01:28:36,511
Okay, Danny,
I need a no-BS assessment here.

951
01:28:36,946 --> 01:28:39,073
Can you get to the crash site?

952
01:28:39,816 --> 01:28:42,410
Colonel, I can't see shit.

953
01:28:46,489 --> 01:28:47,387
Negative.

954
01:28:47,457 --> 01:28:50,517
With the amount of wounded we have,
we'd do more harm than good.

955
01:28:50,593 --> 01:28:54,552
We need to come back to base,
rearm and regroup and then we can go back out.

956
01:28:54,631 --> 01:28:55,620
Roger.

957
01:28:57,467 --> 01:29:00,732
C-2, bring them back.
Get them out of there.

958
01:29:02,205 --> 01:29:03,797
Roger. Return to base.

959
01:29:04,607 --> 01:29:05,972
We're going home!

960
01:29:06,176 --> 01:29:08,167
Let's go. Left.

961
01:29:21,091 --> 01:29:24,390
Roger that. Understand.
Convoy returning to base.

962
01:29:29,666 --> 01:29:31,759
What's up?
They're sending them back.

963
01:29:31,835 --> 01:29:33,496
The convoy's headed back to base camp.

964
01:29:33,570 --> 01:29:35,731
Oh, now that makes sense, don't it?

965
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:40,266
We need to exfil the wounded now and
get out of here before it's too late!

966
01:29:40,610 --> 01:29:44,171
If Colonel McKnight went back to base,
then he had a good reason.

967
01:29:44,347 --> 01:29:45,814
It changes nothing.

968
01:29:46,015 --> 01:29:47,414
All right, listen up.

969
01:29:47,484 --> 01:29:51,477
We're going to hold the perimeter and
we're going to hold the strongpoint.

970
01:29:52,255 --> 01:29:55,520
Conserve your ammo.
Only shoot at what you can hit.

971
01:29:57,327 --> 01:29:59,124
The convoy is going to come.

972
01:30:00,530 --> 01:30:01,519
We're going to get home.

973
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:14,999
Loading!

974
01:30:23,486 --> 01:30:24,817
Loading!

975
01:30:25,355 --> 01:30:27,152
Randy, I need a pistol mag!

976
01:30:40,537 --> 01:30:41,526
Loading!

977
01:30:45,275 --> 01:30:46,674
Randy, last mag!

978
01:30:50,180 --> 01:30:51,204
Gordy!

979
01:30:54,951 --> 01:30:55,940
Fuck!

980
01:31:09,432 --> 01:31:11,627
Gordy is gone, man. I'll be outside.

981
01:31:12,202 --> 01:31:13,328
Good luck.

982
01:31:34,757 --> 01:31:37,624
We need the 10th Mountain in there.
Everything they got.

983
01:31:37,694 --> 01:31:40,822
Pakistanis, Malays,
I want their tanks and APCs.

984
01:31:41,464 --> 01:31:42,863
They don't know we've gone in.

985
01:31:42,932 --> 01:31:47,369
We have stirred up a hornet's nest here.
We're fighting the entire city.

986
01:31:47,871 --> 01:31:52,535
I want every vehicle possible that's
got 4 wheels and armor. Get everything.

987
01:31:52,742 --> 01:31:56,041
Once they've assembled, we'll move
our men out of the hostile area...

988
01:31:56,112 --> 01:31:58,706
And back to the Pakistani Stadium,
the safe zone.

989
01:31:58,781 --> 01:32:01,306
Now, let's go.
Roger that.

990
01:34:38,174 --> 01:34:40,802
On your knees! Get down! Get down!

991
01:34:45,448 --> 01:34:49,384
Stay with me.
You just got a bullet in the leg.

992
01:34:53,923 --> 01:34:56,858
See where those tires are burning?
All that black smoke?

993
01:34:56,926 --> 01:35:00,453
Roger. I can see it,
but I can't get there. Over.

994
01:35:00,663 --> 01:35:03,723
Go 100 meters past it. That's the crash.

995
01:35:03,966 --> 01:35:06,059
Negative. You don't understand.

996
01:35:06,235 --> 01:35:10,763
It's roadblock after roadblock.
You have to find us another route. Over.

997
01:35:11,407 --> 01:35:15,036
There ain't one. The only other
route is all the way around the city.

998
01:35:15,111 --> 01:35:16,203
Roger that.

999
01:35:16,279 --> 01:35:18,770
Kilo 64, this is Kilo 11.

1000
01:35:19,015 --> 01:35:23,475
Request permission to move to
crash site number two on foot. Over.

1001
01:35:24,387 --> 01:35:26,412
Green light, Kilo 11.

1002
01:35:26,489 --> 01:35:28,889
Stop the vehicle. Let me out.

1003
01:36:13,970 --> 01:36:17,565
After I'm finished with this,
I'll whip you boys up some margaritas.

1004
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:20,507
The usual. Blended, no salt.

1005
01:36:27,717 --> 01:36:30,914
This is Kilo 12.
We've got to change our position. Over.

1006
01:36:44,700 --> 01:36:46,429
Eversmann, come in.

1007
01:36:46,669 --> 01:36:47,761
Eversmann.

1008
01:36:50,206 --> 01:36:52,538
Roger, who is this?
Sanderson.

1009
01:36:52,608 --> 01:36:57,045
Do not-- I say again, do not fire
to the east. We are coming to you.

1010
01:36:58,514 --> 01:36:59,640
Understood.

1011
01:36:59,916 --> 01:37:02,350
DiTomasso and his men are
on the southeast corner.

1012
01:37:02,418 --> 01:37:04,784
We need you on the northeast building.

1013
01:37:04,854 --> 01:37:06,321
Roger. We'll take it.

1014
01:37:06,923 --> 01:37:09,153
Watch out for skinnies.
They're on the rooftops.

1015
01:37:09,225 --> 01:37:11,716
They're in prayer but
not for much longer.

1016
01:37:15,198 --> 01:37:16,995
Hold your fire to the east.

1017
01:37:39,088 --> 01:37:40,783
Eversmann? It's Yurek.

1018
01:37:41,157 --> 01:37:43,557
I got Nelson and Twombly with me.

1019
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:46,724
We got the chopper in sight.
Where are you?

1020
01:37:46,963 --> 01:37:50,091
We're on the southwest corner.
Where have you been? Are you okay?

1021
01:37:50,166 --> 01:37:51,030
Yeah.

1022
01:37:52,602 --> 01:37:54,729
Hold your fire. We're coming in.

1023
01:37:59,542 --> 01:38:00,600
We got to go.

1024
01:38:00,676 --> 01:38:03,611
Shawn, listen!
Sergeant Yurek's going to run first.

1025
01:38:03,779 --> 01:38:07,738
When he gets across the street,
he'll turn around and cover you as you run.

1026
01:38:07,817 --> 01:38:11,947
Listen closely. When you get there,
you'll turn around and cover me, okay?

1027
01:38:13,589 --> 01:38:15,921
You won't just run to
Eversmann's position.

1028
01:38:15,992 --> 01:38:18,825
You're going to stop and
you are going to cover me.

1029
01:38:19,328 --> 01:38:21,489
It's important you understand that.

1030
01:38:21,964 --> 01:38:23,329
Okay, you ready?

1031
01:38:24,133 --> 01:38:25,498
Yeah, I guess.

1032
01:38:31,073 --> 01:38:32,631
Don't forget.
What?

1033
01:38:33,309 --> 01:38:34,537
Don't forget.

1034
01:38:48,057 --> 01:38:51,424
I got them in my sight, Sarg'nt.
They're coming up on the west gate.

1035
01:38:51,494 --> 01:38:52,620
I see them.

1036
01:38:55,564 --> 01:38:56,861
Let's move out.

1037
01:38:59,302 --> 01:39:01,031
Can you cover us, Sergeant?

1038
01:39:01,270 --> 01:39:02,601
We got you.

1039
01:39:09,845 --> 01:39:11,244
Nelson!

1040
01:39:18,054 --> 01:39:19,043
Fuck!

1041
01:39:27,563 --> 01:39:28,552
Twombly!

1042
01:39:30,366 --> 01:39:31,492
Smith! No!

1043
01:39:31,634 --> 01:39:32,896
You all right?

1044
01:39:36,238 --> 01:39:37,603
Get it off of me!

1045
01:39:38,374 --> 01:39:39,773
Get it off!

1046
01:39:41,077 --> 01:39:42,704
Come on, man. Come on.

1047
01:39:43,879 --> 01:39:46,814
Doc! Need some help with Smith here!

1048
01:39:55,224 --> 01:39:56,521
My leg! My leg!

1049
01:39:56,592 --> 01:39:58,287
Come on, Jamie, I got you!

1050
01:40:05,368 --> 01:40:07,393
Up, one, two, three.

1051
01:40:08,738 --> 01:40:11,400
You're all right.
I need some pressure on this wound.

1052
01:40:11,474 --> 01:40:12,532
My right thigh!

1053
01:40:12,608 --> 01:40:14,303
Pressure, yeah.

1054
01:40:14,477 --> 01:40:16,809
Are my balls okay?
You still have your balls.

1055
01:40:16,879 --> 01:40:17,971
I need more men in here.

1056
01:40:18,047 --> 01:40:20,641
Twombly! Nelson!

1057
01:40:20,716 --> 01:40:23,776
Put him down.
Oh, man, that really....

1058
01:40:25,121 --> 01:40:27,351
It really hurts!
Direct pressure on that.

1059
01:40:27,423 --> 01:40:28,913
It's okay, it's okay.

1060
01:40:29,492 --> 01:40:31,858
Let me see it!
All right.

1061
01:40:32,328 --> 01:40:34,592
All right, let me get a look at that.

1062
01:40:34,997 --> 01:40:36,396
Oh, shit!

1063
01:40:36,599 --> 01:40:37,827
Oh, fuck!

1064
01:40:38,034 --> 01:40:40,434
What the fuck was that?
It's all right.

1065
01:40:40,503 --> 01:40:42,664
Hold that down. I need a medivac now.

1066
01:40:42,738 --> 01:40:44,137
Fuck. Galentine!

1067
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:45,329
It's all right.

1068
01:40:45,408 --> 01:40:47,205
Galentine! Get me Captain Steele!

1069
01:40:48,144 --> 01:40:51,170
Sarg'nt Ruiz, how you doing?
Juliet 64, come in. Over.

1070
01:40:51,247 --> 01:40:55,115
They're not going to come and get us.
They're not going to come for us.

1071
01:40:55,217 --> 01:40:58,277
I need you to suck it up, Sarg'nt.
I need you to focus.

1072
01:40:58,354 --> 01:41:00,754
Can you do that?
Juliet 64, come in. Over.

1073
01:41:00,823 --> 01:41:02,723
Now, can you hold your weapon?

1074
01:41:03,092 --> 01:41:04,081
Yes, sir.

1075
01:41:04,326 --> 01:41:08,319
Anybody comes through that door gets
two in the chest and one in the head.

1076
01:41:08,664 --> 01:41:12,100
You understand?
I'm still in the fight, sir.

1077
01:41:12,368 --> 01:41:15,303
Captain Steele,
I need a medivac in here now!

1078
01:41:15,504 --> 01:41:17,995
Corporal Smith has been hit!
Hold on, 25.

1079
01:41:18,340 --> 01:41:19,773
Still in the fight.

1080
01:41:19,842 --> 01:41:21,309
He's hurt pretty bad.

1081
01:41:21,377 --> 01:41:25,108
25, we got wounded too. You'll have
to maintain your situation, over.

1082
01:41:25,181 --> 01:41:27,741
If he doesn't get help in a half-hour,
he's in trouble!

1083
01:41:28,517 --> 01:41:30,610
C-2, this is 64.

1084
01:41:30,820 --> 01:41:35,052
Requesting a medivac for a critically
wounded at Chalk Four's location. Over.

1085
01:41:35,124 --> 01:41:37,991
Command, Chalk Four
is requesting medivac.

1086
01:41:38,194 --> 01:41:40,526
Can't risk it. It's still too hot.

1087
01:41:40,996 --> 01:41:45,865
Captain, we cannot send in medivac
at this time. Sit tight. Over.

1088
01:41:46,202 --> 01:41:50,036
25, this is 64. Negative on the medivac.
It's not possible.

1089
01:41:50,239 --> 01:41:54,005
JOC cannot risk another bird.
You'll just have to hold on.

1090
01:42:00,583 --> 01:42:02,016
All right. I got him.

1091
01:42:02,084 --> 01:42:04,518
I want direct pressure on the wound.

1092
01:42:06,388 --> 01:42:08,185
It's going to be all right.

1093
01:42:47,263 --> 01:42:50,130
I think this is mine!

1094
01:42:52,768 --> 01:42:55,896
This is Kilo 11.
I'm at the Durant crash site.

1095
01:42:56,105 --> 01:42:57,504
Roger that.

1096
01:43:19,094 --> 01:43:20,857
Crash site two secured.

1097
01:43:21,096 --> 01:43:23,462
Lieutenant Colonel Cribbs for you, sir.

1098
01:43:23,966 --> 01:43:24,830
Cribbs?

1099
01:43:26,835 --> 01:43:29,133
They're still debating the route.
How long?

1100
01:43:29,271 --> 01:43:30,898
At least a couple of hours.

1101
01:43:31,073 --> 01:43:32,734
We haven't got that long, Joe.

1102
01:43:32,808 --> 01:43:37,404
Pakistani General says, since we didn't
deign to inform him of the raid...

1103
01:43:37,613 --> 01:43:41,447
It'll take some time to mobilize
the 10th Mountain and 100 vehicles.

1104
01:43:41,517 --> 01:43:43,508
You tell the general this:

1105
01:43:43,719 --> 01:43:46,620
I understand, but it is
my duty to remind him...

1106
01:43:46,822 --> 01:43:50,883
That my men are surrounded by
thousands of armed Somali militia.

1107
01:43:51,093 --> 01:43:56,360
It's imperative that we move them out of
the hostile area and into the safe zone.

1108
01:43:56,565 --> 01:43:58,089
I need his help now.

1109
01:43:59,101 --> 01:44:00,329
Yes, sir.

1110
01:44:05,441 --> 01:44:06,669
Durant.

1111
01:44:07,376 --> 01:44:09,844
Michael Durant.

1112
01:44:10,579 --> 01:44:11,568
Yes.

1113
01:44:12,047 --> 01:44:14,447
You are the Ranger who kills my people?

1114
01:44:14,650 --> 01:44:18,051
I'm not a Ranger. I'm a pilot.

1115
01:44:21,991 --> 01:44:23,288
That's right.

1116
01:44:23,959 --> 01:44:26,951
None of you Americans smoke anymore.

1117
01:44:30,165 --> 01:44:34,795
You all live long, dull, uninteresting lives.

1118
01:44:36,672 --> 01:44:38,537
What do you want with me?

1119
01:44:39,375 --> 01:44:41,104
You have taken hostages.

1120
01:44:42,111 --> 01:44:43,703
We have you.

1121
01:44:43,912 --> 01:44:47,006
My government will
never negotiate for me.

1122
01:44:47,549 --> 01:44:52,111
Then perhaps you and
I can negotiate, huh?

1123
01:44:53,589 --> 01:44:56,114
Soldier to soldier.

1124
01:45:02,064 --> 01:45:03,861
I'm not in charge.

1125
01:45:07,136 --> 01:45:11,573
Course not. You have the power to kill,
but not negotiate.

1126
01:45:12,041 --> 01:45:14,942
In Somalia, killing is negotiation.

1127
01:45:16,512 --> 01:45:19,879
Do you really think if
you get General Aidid...

1128
01:45:20,082 --> 01:45:23,449
We will simply put down our weapons...

1129
01:45:23,585 --> 01:45:26,577
And adopt American democracy?

1130
01:45:27,022 --> 01:45:28,819
That the killing will stop?

1131
01:45:29,224 --> 01:45:33,285
We know this:
Without victory, there can be no peace.

1132
01:45:34,063 --> 01:45:36,497
There will always be killing, you see?

1133
01:45:36,965 --> 01:45:39,160
This is how things are in our world.

1134
01:45:52,014 --> 01:45:55,677
Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind.

1135
01:45:57,820 --> 01:46:01,256
Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind.

1136
01:46:03,992 --> 01:46:06,859
You got to take over from me.
Both hands.

1137
01:46:14,570 --> 01:46:17,801
It's the femoral artery,
but I can't see it.

1138
01:46:18,006 --> 01:46:21,464
Which means that it's
retracted up into the pelvis.

1139
01:46:21,677 --> 01:46:25,977
I have to find it and clamp it.
It's the only way to stop the bleeding.

1140
01:46:26,181 --> 01:46:28,274
I got no more IVs.

1141
01:46:29,551 --> 01:46:32,452
So, I'm going to need
you to assist. Okay?

1142
01:46:32,588 --> 01:46:34,215
Yeah, yeah.

1143
01:46:35,157 --> 01:46:38,524
Now listen, Jamie.
I got to do something, it's going to hurt.

1144
01:46:39,795 --> 01:46:43,492
I got to cause you more pain,
but I have to do it to help you.

1145
01:46:43,699 --> 01:46:45,223
All right, you understand?

1146
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:47,291
Morphine.
I can't.

1147
01:46:47,503 --> 01:46:50,097
It'll lower your heart rate too far.
I'm sorry.

1148
01:46:50,172 --> 01:46:52,470
Twombly, why don't you take his hands?

1149
01:46:56,979 --> 01:46:59,914
Hold the wound open,
keep pressure on the top of the leg.

1150
01:46:59,982 --> 01:47:02,177
Yurek, take the feet and a flashlight.

1151
01:47:02,584 --> 01:47:03,710
On my count.

1152
01:47:03,786 --> 01:47:05,777
All right, Jamie. All right.

1153
01:47:08,056 --> 01:47:10,217
One. Two.

1154
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:12,218
Three.

1155
01:47:19,935 --> 01:47:22,369
Wait, wait. Okay. I feel it.

1156
01:47:23,005 --> 01:47:24,370
I feel the pulse.

1157
01:47:25,941 --> 01:47:27,272
I got it. I got it.

1158
01:47:27,342 --> 01:47:28,934
I got it, yeah. I got it.

1159
01:47:29,011 --> 01:47:30,603
I got it.
You got it?

1160
01:47:31,046 --> 01:47:32,035
Clamp?

1161
01:47:34,450 --> 01:47:35,815
I got it clamped.

1162
01:47:35,951 --> 01:47:37,145
Hold it.
Got it.

1163
01:47:37,219 --> 01:47:38,481
Here, grab it.

1164
01:47:39,154 --> 01:47:40,883
It's tearing.
I got it.

1165
01:47:41,123 --> 01:47:42,988
Doc, it's going back in!
Hold it!

1166
01:47:43,058 --> 01:47:44,286
It's tearing!

1167
01:47:44,626 --> 01:47:47,595
Okay. Get out. Hold the wound.
Okay, I'm holding.

1168
01:47:48,831 --> 01:47:50,128
Move your hand.

1169
01:48:01,343 --> 01:48:02,571
What?

1170
01:48:21,697 --> 01:48:22,686
Fix it?

1171
01:48:26,301 --> 01:48:28,735
Yeah, yeah. We got it.

1172
01:48:44,386 --> 01:48:46,183
What the hell are you doing?

1173
01:48:46,255 --> 01:48:50,658
It's all in the grind, Sarg'nt.
Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.

1174
01:48:50,859 --> 01:48:53,521
Grimesy, you are squared away.

1175
01:49:09,845 --> 01:49:13,804
Sarg'nt, how would you
like a nice hot cup of Joe?

1176
01:49:15,617 --> 01:49:17,209
Gold Coast blend.

1177
01:49:17,419 --> 01:49:20,354
Sit down.
I want to take a look at that foot.

1178
01:49:20,956 --> 01:49:23,049
No, it's not a problem.
Come on.

1179
01:49:29,498 --> 01:49:32,592
Where the hell did they find you?
Behind a desk.

1180
01:49:34,102 --> 01:49:37,128
No, really. What, you think I'm kidding?

1181
01:49:40,809 --> 01:49:42,606
Is anybody hit?
We're good!

1182
01:49:47,983 --> 01:49:49,143
You all right?

1183
01:49:49,217 --> 01:49:50,206
Yeah!

1184
01:49:50,419 --> 01:49:51,886
Is everybody all right?

1185
01:49:51,954 --> 01:49:52,978
Yeah!

1186
01:50:07,002 --> 01:50:08,196
Incoming!

1187
01:50:21,383 --> 01:50:23,317
Keep firing... Faster!

1188
01:51:13,769 --> 01:51:15,760
DiTomasso's hit! Pull him out!

1189
01:51:49,237 --> 01:51:50,966
Ranger here. This is Kilo 11.

1190
01:51:51,039 --> 01:51:54,270
Chalk Four. We're at the southeast
corner of the crash. Who's this?

1191
01:51:54,342 --> 01:51:56,333
This is Hoot.
I'm coming with three friendlies.

1192
01:51:56,411 --> 01:51:58,072
I need cover fire. Over.

1193
01:51:58,146 --> 01:52:01,081
Roger, Kilo 11. Hold your fire!
Deltas coming in.

1194
01:52:01,149 --> 01:52:03,174
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

1195
01:52:07,889 --> 01:52:12,519
Ground personnel will have to mark
target positions with infrared strobes.

1196
01:52:13,195 --> 01:52:16,961
Get little birds on strafing runs
and keep them going all night long.

1197
01:52:17,065 --> 01:52:19,329
If we don't hold back this city...

1198
01:52:20,035 --> 01:52:23,027
We'll have a 100 caskets
to fill by morning.

1199
01:52:23,238 --> 01:52:24,466
Yes, sir.

1200
01:52:24,673 --> 01:52:27,437
Colonel Harrell, ground
personnel at crash site one...

1201
01:52:27,509 --> 01:52:32,003
Will have to mark the target with
infrared strobes to prep for air strike.

1202
01:52:37,285 --> 01:52:38,513
McKnight.

1203
01:52:42,591 --> 01:52:46,186
Between the 10th Mountain and UN,
we got enough personnel, okay?

1204
01:52:47,529 --> 01:52:50,327
Danny, you guys do not
have to go back out again.

1205
01:53:10,485 --> 01:53:13,045
I can't die here, man.

1206
01:53:14,222 --> 01:53:18,318
You're not going to die, all right?
You're not going to die.

1207
01:53:19,227 --> 01:53:20,694
I'm sorry.

1208
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:24,161
You don't have anything to be sorry for.

1209
01:53:24,332 --> 01:53:27,495
You saved Twombly. You did perfect.

1210
01:53:28,703 --> 01:53:30,170
You okay, Twombs?

1211
01:53:30,739 --> 01:53:32,570
Yeah, I'm okay, Jamie.

1212
01:53:33,909 --> 01:53:36,104
You did what you were trained to do.

1213
01:53:37,045 --> 01:53:38,910
You should be proud of that.

1214
01:53:42,017 --> 01:53:43,348
Be proud of that.

1215
01:53:44,186 --> 01:53:46,051
Ev?
Yeah.

1216
01:53:48,023 --> 01:53:49,354
Do me a favor.

1217
01:53:52,427 --> 01:53:57,364
You tell my parents
that I fought well today.

1218
01:54:04,806 --> 01:54:06,671
And that I fought hard.

1219
01:54:08,643 --> 01:54:11,111
You're going to tell
them yourself, okay?

1220
01:54:11,179 --> 01:54:12,510
Do you hear me?

1221
01:54:14,316 --> 01:54:15,374
All right?

1222
01:54:17,519 --> 01:54:20,647
Are the humvees here?
They're coming, Jamie.

1223
01:54:21,156 --> 01:54:22,987
They're coming.

1224
01:54:23,158 --> 01:54:25,422
You just got to hang
in there a little bit.

1225
01:54:25,493 --> 01:54:27,984
You hold on for just a little bit.
I can.

1226
01:54:28,163 --> 01:54:29,323
I can.

1227
01:54:30,699 --> 01:54:32,166
It's nothing.

1228
01:54:33,401 --> 01:54:34,834
It's nothing.

1229
01:54:35,871 --> 01:54:36,997
It's nothing.

1230
01:54:37,072 --> 01:54:39,404
It's nothing.
It's nothing.

1231
01:54:40,342 --> 01:54:41,502
Nothing.

1232
01:54:49,184 --> 01:54:50,173
Oh, shit.

1233
01:54:51,186 --> 01:54:52,517
Hold the wound.

1234
01:55:19,547 --> 01:55:20,844
Doc.

1235
01:55:23,718 --> 01:55:24,742
Doc.

1236
01:55:41,836 --> 01:55:43,167
It's okay.

1237
01:56:09,798 --> 01:56:11,265
What are you doing?

1238
01:56:14,636 --> 01:56:16,365
We need the ammo.

1239
01:56:24,646 --> 01:56:26,443
You did all you could here.

1240
01:56:26,982 --> 01:56:29,212
They should've sent a medivac.

1241
01:56:29,718 --> 01:56:33,381
Right now we'd be out there
defending another crashed chopper.

1242
01:56:33,655 --> 01:56:36,146
More men would get torn up.

1243
01:56:39,160 --> 01:56:40,491
Maybe.

1244
01:56:40,996 --> 01:56:43,863
See, you're thinking. Don't.

1245
01:56:43,965 --> 01:56:46,991
Because, Sergeant, you can't
control who gets hit or who doesn't.

1246
01:56:47,068 --> 01:56:49,832
Who falls out of a chopper or why.

1247
01:56:50,038 --> 01:56:52,666
It ain't up to you. It's just war.

1248
01:56:54,676 --> 01:56:56,667
Yeah, well, Smith's still dead.

1249
01:56:58,346 --> 01:57:02,942
This all happened because Blackburn fell.
Should have, could have, don't matter.

1250
01:57:03,118 --> 01:57:06,884
You'll get plenty of time to think
about all that later. Believe me.

1251
01:57:10,658 --> 01:57:13,786
Sergeant, you got your men this far.

1252
01:57:14,629 --> 01:57:16,324
You did it right today.

1253
01:57:16,531 --> 01:57:19,989
You need to start thinking about
getting these men out of here.

1254
01:57:26,408 --> 01:57:28,308
Well, shall we?

1255
01:57:37,052 --> 01:57:40,146
I need four guys in this corner now!

1256
01:57:46,327 --> 01:57:47,919
RPG!

1257
01:57:51,833 --> 01:57:54,324
This is Barber 52 in
position for gun run.

1258
01:57:54,402 --> 01:57:56,529
Jesus Christ. Look at that.

1259
01:57:57,238 --> 01:58:00,264
This is 25! I can see you.
You're right above me.

1260
01:58:00,442 --> 01:58:03,878
Eversmann, I can't tell who's
who down there. Too much activity.

1261
01:58:03,945 --> 01:58:06,436
I'll mark the target with a strobe! Over.

1262
01:58:06,681 --> 01:58:07,841
Roger that.

1263
01:58:19,627 --> 01:58:20,787
You see it?

1264
01:58:23,131 --> 01:58:24,723
Nah, I can't see shit.

1265
01:58:25,700 --> 01:58:28,567
I'm putting it on the roof.
You're going to need help!

1266
01:58:28,636 --> 01:58:29,625
Cover me.

1267
01:58:30,839 --> 01:58:34,605
Okay, guys, we're going to lay down
some cover fire for him on three!

1268
01:58:34,809 --> 01:58:35,798
Ready?

1269
01:58:35,977 --> 01:58:36,966
One.

1270
01:58:37,045 --> 01:58:38,137
Two.

1271
01:58:38,313 --> 01:58:40,042
Three. Go!

1272
01:59:12,614 --> 01:59:16,050
I got your position. I got the target.
We're inbound and hot.

1273
01:59:40,642 --> 01:59:45,306
C-2, miniguns dry. Request permission
to return to base. Rearm. Over.

1274
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:48,313
Roger that. Second team inbound.
Your station.

1275
01:59:48,483 --> 01:59:50,678
On your location, four minutes.

1276
01:59:58,826 --> 02:00:01,886
All right, they're here.
Get the wounded ready to move.

1277
02:00:02,363 --> 02:00:04,797
Lay down some cover fire!

1278
02:00:07,135 --> 02:00:09,228
I thought I heard a noise out here!

1279
02:00:09,304 --> 02:00:12,034
Load up. We're getting out of here.
Yes, sir.

1280
02:00:15,210 --> 02:00:19,943
25, this is 64. The rescue column's here
and will be with you in about 5 minutes.

1281
02:00:20,148 --> 02:00:21,877
Prepare your men for exfil.

1282
02:00:21,950 --> 02:00:24,441
Yeah, roger that, sir! Roger that!

1283
02:00:25,186 --> 02:00:28,952
Five minutes! The convoy is
going to be here in five minutes!

1284
02:00:48,910 --> 02:00:51,174
I need a mag! Eversmann, I'm out!

1285
02:00:51,346 --> 02:00:52,677
My last one!

1286
02:01:02,857 --> 02:01:05,018
The convoy is here!

1287
02:01:23,578 --> 02:01:27,105
Sergeant Eversmann.
I heard you guys needed a lift!

1288
02:01:27,348 --> 02:01:29,009
Yes, sir!

1289
02:01:29,217 --> 02:01:31,811
Bring your wounded and
start loading them up!

1290
02:01:39,027 --> 02:01:41,154
Hey, I got you. I got you.

1291
02:01:41,362 --> 02:01:44,092
It's okay. I want to walk.

1292
02:01:44,632 --> 02:01:47,692
Yeah, I would too. Let's go!

1293
02:01:56,878 --> 02:01:57,970
Move!

1294
02:02:01,249 --> 02:02:04,582
We get the pilots' bodies out,
and then we go to the stadium.

1295
02:02:05,253 --> 02:02:07,050
We're running out of room around here.

1296
02:02:07,121 --> 02:02:09,089
Cram into every possible space.

1297
02:02:09,924 --> 02:02:14,918
Okay, 10th Mountain provides security
for armor, walks us out of the hot zone.

1298
02:02:15,129 --> 02:02:16,619
10th Mountain? No.

1299
02:02:16,831 --> 02:02:19,925
Sir, with respect, my Rangers
can provide rear security.

1300
02:02:20,101 --> 02:02:24,265
We'll walk you out of the hot zone,
then we'll jump on the last few vehicles.

1301
02:02:25,273 --> 02:02:26,535
Okay, let's get out of here.

1302
02:02:26,607 --> 02:02:27,801
Let's go.

1303
02:02:28,009 --> 02:02:30,500
All right, you got him?
Yeah, come on.

1304
02:02:32,447 --> 02:02:33,812
Come on!

1305
02:02:34,949 --> 02:02:37,941
These things are fucking bullet magnets.
Come on, let's go!

1306
02:02:38,019 --> 02:02:40,453
We go when I'm ordered to, soldier.

1307
02:02:43,324 --> 02:02:44,518
Careful.

1308
02:02:45,126 --> 02:02:47,321
Easy. Go easy.

1309
02:02:50,732 --> 02:02:52,097
Easy.

1310
02:03:02,610 --> 02:03:04,840
Colonel, what is going on down there?

1311
02:03:04,912 --> 02:03:08,109
They're dismantling the
entire cockpit around the body.

1312
02:03:08,316 --> 02:03:11,979
How long is it going to take?
I need an honest, no-shit assessment.

1313
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:14,285
They can't say!

1314
02:03:16,257 --> 02:03:17,485
Danny...

1315
02:03:18,993 --> 02:03:20,790
No one gets left behind.

1316
02:03:21,496 --> 02:03:23,327
You understand me, son?

1317
02:03:23,798 --> 02:03:25,265
Yes, General.

1318
02:03:25,933 --> 02:03:27,560
Do what you have to do.

1319
02:03:28,936 --> 02:03:30,198
Roger.

1320
02:03:36,844 --> 02:03:39,074
Come on. Bring him through.
I got him.

1321
02:03:39,947 --> 02:03:43,110
Get all his gear. Get the wounded out.
Got you, sir!

1322
02:03:48,723 --> 02:03:50,122
Move!
Got you!

1323
02:03:50,792 --> 02:03:52,817
Move out! Move out! Let's go!

1324
02:04:02,904 --> 02:04:03,893
Fuck!

1325
02:04:06,741 --> 02:04:08,072
Fire in the hole!

1326
02:04:08,276 --> 02:04:10,107
Let's go! Move!
Let's go!

1327
02:04:20,655 --> 02:04:24,056
Open the hatch! We got men back here!
No room here! Go on the roof!

1328
02:04:24,125 --> 02:04:25,217
What's going on?

1329
02:04:25,293 --> 02:04:28,285
The roof?
I'm not getting on no fucking roof!

1330
02:04:29,263 --> 02:04:30,662
No, no, it's full.

1331
02:04:32,099 --> 02:04:35,364
We're running out. Keep moving.
Use the vehicles as cover.

1332
02:04:37,772 --> 02:04:39,831
Move it! Let's go!

1333
02:04:56,757 --> 02:04:59,282
All right, hold it up. Hold it up.

1334
02:05:01,295 --> 02:05:02,660
Move!
Go! Move!

1335
02:05:02,897 --> 02:05:04,262
Go!

1336
02:05:58,853 --> 02:06:01,287
Get down! Get down!

1337
02:06:02,523 --> 02:06:03,785
Get down, lady!

1338
02:06:06,294 --> 02:06:07,659
I'm out of ammo!

1339
02:06:09,030 --> 02:06:11,021
Sanderson, I'm out of ammo!

1340
02:06:16,037 --> 02:06:17,629
Don't you do it.

1341
02:06:18,239 --> 02:06:20,730
What are you doing?
Don't you damn do it.

1342
02:06:22,543 --> 02:06:23,908
Kurth, let's go!

1343
02:08:47,755 --> 02:08:49,245
Easy.

1344
02:09:39,140 --> 02:09:40,903
Ah, shit.

1345
02:09:40,975 --> 02:09:44,638
Bullet missed your jugular by
about three millimeters. Don't move.

1346
02:09:46,313 --> 02:09:48,338
Hurry up, hurry up.

1347
02:09:51,719 --> 02:09:55,712
Little short on coffee,
but I got you some tea.

1348
02:09:59,994 --> 02:10:01,621
How you doing, soldier?

1349
02:10:02,830 --> 02:10:04,695
Can't feel a thing.

1350
02:10:14,775 --> 02:10:16,367
Take his pulse.

1351
02:10:49,710 --> 02:10:51,109
Hey, Sarg'nt.

1352
02:10:55,683 --> 02:10:56,672
Captain.

1353
02:10:56,851 --> 02:10:59,843
Lorenzo. How you doing?

1354
02:11:02,456 --> 02:11:07,291
It went in and out, so the medic said
I should be okay in a couple of days.

1355
02:11:07,461 --> 02:11:09,156
That's great news.

1356
02:11:09,763 --> 02:11:11,458
Are we going after them?

1357
02:11:11,565 --> 02:11:14,295
You bet your ass we will.
We got to regroup.

1358
02:11:15,870 --> 02:11:17,804
Don't go out there without me.

1359
02:11:18,806 --> 02:11:22,298
Don't go back out there without me.

1360
02:11:23,043 --> 02:11:24,943
I can still do my job.

1361
02:11:26,714 --> 02:11:29,342
You get some rest now, okay?

1362
02:11:44,498 --> 02:11:45,897
You're going back in?

1363
02:11:48,002 --> 02:11:49,833
There are still men out there.

1364
02:11:52,239 --> 02:11:53,797
Goddamn.

1365
02:11:58,979 --> 02:12:00,276
When I go home...

1366
02:12:01,282 --> 02:12:02,772
And people ask me:

1367
02:12:02,950 --> 02:12:06,283
"Hey, Hoot, why do you do it, man?

1368
02:12:06,854 --> 02:12:10,688
"Why? You some kind of war junkie?"

1369
02:12:11,492 --> 02:12:13,926
I won't say a goddamn word.

1370
02:12:14,261 --> 02:12:15,489
Why?

1371
02:12:16,130 --> 02:12:17,961
They won't understand.

1372
02:12:19,700 --> 02:12:21,998
They won't understand why we do it.

1373
02:12:23,504 --> 02:12:27,634
They won't understand it's
about the men next to you.

1374
02:12:29,476 --> 02:12:30,807
And that's it.

1375
02:12:32,980 --> 02:12:34,311
That's all it is.

1376
02:12:44,658 --> 02:12:49,027
Don't even think about it, all right?
I'm better on my own.

1377
02:12:54,168 --> 02:12:57,160
We started a whole new week.
It's Monday.

1378
02:13:10,017 --> 02:13:12,178
I was talking to
Blackburn the other day...

1379
02:13:12,252 --> 02:13:16,951
And he asked me, "What changed?
Why are we going home?"

1380
02:13:18,492 --> 02:13:20,824
And I said, "Nothing. "

1381
02:13:21,028 --> 02:13:24,964
But that's not true, you know.
I think everything's changed.

1382
02:13:26,367 --> 02:13:27,857
I know I've changed.

1383
02:13:33,640 --> 02:13:36,336
A friend of mine asked
me before I got here....

1384
02:13:36,477 --> 02:13:38,741
It was when we were all shipping out.

1385
02:13:38,879 --> 02:13:40,369
He asked me:

1386
02:13:41,648 --> 02:13:44,378
"Why are you going to
fight somebody else's war?

1387
02:13:45,085 --> 02:13:47,519
"What, do y'all think you're heroes?"

1388
02:13:50,491 --> 02:13:52,891
I didn't know what to say at the time...

1389
02:13:55,829 --> 02:13:58,229
But if he asked me again, I'd say no.

1390
02:14:00,801 --> 02:14:02,826
I'd say there's no way in hell.

1391
02:14:03,937 --> 02:14:05,962
Nobody asks to be a hero.

1392
02:14:11,311 --> 02:14:13,575
It just sometimes turns out that way.

1393
02:14:17,551 --> 02:14:20,611
I'll talk to your ma and
pa when I get home, okay?

1394
02:15:04,198 --> 02:15:07,895
My love, you are strong and
you will do well in life.

1395
02:15:08,936 --> 02:15:11,404
I love you and my children deeply.

1396
02:15:12,306 --> 02:15:15,798
Today and tomorrow,
let each day grow and grow.

1397
02:15:17,010 --> 02:15:21,174
Keep smiling and never give up,
even when things get you down.

1398
02:15:22,483 --> 02:15:24,917
So, in closing, my love...

1399
02:15:25,285 --> 02:15:29,119
Tonight, tuck my children in bed warmly.

1400
02:15:29,556 --> 02:15:34,152
Tell them I love them.
Then hug them for me...

1401
02:15:34,361 --> 02:15:37,194
And give them both a
kiss good night for Daddy.
