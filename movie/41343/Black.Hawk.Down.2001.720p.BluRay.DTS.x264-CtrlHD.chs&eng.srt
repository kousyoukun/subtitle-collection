谢了，我有了
No, thanks. I got one.

47

迈阿密雪茄没古巴雪茄赞
Miami, my friend, is not Cuba.

51
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,625
你们老是抓不到艾迪德
I see not catching Aidid is becoming a routine.

52
00:07:12,193 --> 00:07:15,094
这次我们要抓的是你
We weren't trying to catch Aidid. We were trying to catch you.

53
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:15,992
我？
Me?

54
00:07:16,698 --> 00:07:18,563
我有这么重要吗？
But am I that important?

55
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,633
没有吧
I hardly think so.

56
00:07:20,702 --> 00:07:23,694
-你只是个生意人 -只想混口饭吃
-You're just a businessman. -Trying to make a living.

57
00:07:24,205 --> 00:07:26,867
你贩卖枪械给艾迪德的民兵
Yeah. Selling guns to Aidid's militia.

58
00:07:31,713 --> 00:07:33,146
你来了多久？
You've been here, what?

59
00:07:34,716 --> 00:07:36,240
6个星期？
Six weeks?

60
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,814
6星期来你一直想抓到他
Six weeks you are trying to catch the general.

61
00:07:42,223 --> 00:07:44,384
到处张帖悬赏海报
You put up reward posters.

62
00:07:44,726 --> 00:07:48,958
两万五千美元，你想演“终结追杀令”吗？
$25,000. What is this? Gunfight at the K.O. Corral?

63
00:07:50,231 --> 00:07:53,200
是“绝命追杀令”
It's the O.K. Corral.

64
00:07:53,735 --> 00:07:57,865
你以为把我抓来他就会自首？
Do you think bringing me in will make him suddenly come to you?

65
00:07:58,239 --> 00:08:00,366
乖乖束手就擒？
Make him more agreeable?

66
00:08:03,244 --> 00:08:05,178
你知道他在哪里
You know where he sleeps.

67
00:08:05,747 --> 00:08:09,205
你资助他的一切，包括民兵
You pay for his beds, much less his militia.

68
00:08:10,752 --> 00:08:13,812
我们逮不到他就不走
We're not leaving Somalia till we find him.

69
00:08:15,757 --> 00:08:16,689
我们一定会逮到他
And we will find him.

70
00:08:16,758 --> 00:08:19,352
别以为我从小没自来水喝
Don't think because I grew up without running water...

71
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:21,729
就是个笨蛋
...l am simple, General.

72
00:08:22,764 --> 00:08:25,096
我对历史很了解
I do know something about history.

73
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:30,170
你看到吗？我们在创造明天
See all this? It's simply shaping tomorrow.

74
00:08:30,772 --> 00:08:34,674
一个没有阿肯色州白小子的明天
A tomorrow without a lot of Arkansas white boys' ideas in it.

75
00:08:35,276 --> 00:08:38,074
我来自德州
Well, I wouldn't know about that. I'm from Texas.

76
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:42,375
盖将军，你们不该来这儿
Mr. Garrison, I think you shouldn't have come here.

77
00:08:43,284 --> 00:08:45,149
这是内战
This is civil war.

78
00:08:46,287 --> 00:08:48,084
这是我们的战争
This is our war.

79
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,018
不是你们的
Not yours.

80
00:08:51,793 --> 00:08:54,523
三十万人死亡
300,000 dead and counting.

81
00:08:54,796 --> 00:08:58,095
这不是战争，这是种族屠杀
That's not a war, Mr. Atto. That's genocide.

82
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,860
喝茶吧
Now, you enjoy that tea, you hear?

83
00:09:07,775 --> 00:09:09,504
你觉得他怎样？
How'd he strike you?

84
00:09:09,777 --> 00:09:12,712
彬彬有礼、冷酷无情
Urbane, sophisticated, cruel.

85
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,509
他是一条大鱼
Yeah, he's a good catch.

86
00:09:15,283 --> 00:09:17,615
时间一久艾迪德就会感到受制
lt'll take time, but Aidid will feel the loss.

87
00:09:17,785 --> 00:09:20,219
我们没有太多时间
I'm not sure time is something we got in great supply.

88
00:09:20,288 --> 00:09:24,418
这比伊拉克的情形更复杂
This isn't lraq, you know. Much more complicated than that.

89
00:09:25,293 --> 00:09:27,261
但华府官员可不这么想
Boss, most of Washington might disagree.

90
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:31,425
他们每天都要我们提出报告
They've been calling for situation reports every morning this week.

91
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,600
你就说战争一触即发
Well, tell them the situation is fragile.

这是64号，使用高频无线电
61, this is 64, Go to UHF secure,

我有坏消息
I've got some bad news.

102
00:10:27,355 --> 00:10:30,051
礼车是一个字，别跟我罗唆
"Limo" is a word, Durant. I don't want to hear about it.

103
00:10:30,358 --> 00:10:32,986
那是缩写，不是一个字
It is not a Word, It's an abbreviation of a Word,

104
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:35,295
那是常用语
"Limo" is a word in common usage.

105
00:10:35,363 --> 00:10:39,026
拼字游戏的规则接受常用语
That is the key phrase in Scrabble, my good friend. Common usage.

106
00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:42,336
字典查不到就不算
If it's not in the dictionary it doesn't count!

107
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,429
字典查不到也算
It doesn't have to be in the dictionary!

108
00:10:44,872 --> 00:10:46,806
字典查不到就不算
It does have to be in the dictionary!

109
00:10:46,874 --> 00:10:50,105
等我回基地就把这个字剔除
When we get back to the base, it's coming off.

110
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:54,143
你敢我就扁你，听到吗？
You touch my "limo" and I'll spank you, Nightstalker,

Yeah, promises.

Firstly, it's "the Mog" or simply "Mog." No one calls it Mogadishu here.

122
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:34,786
我没有打仗，别问我
Secondly, I wouldn't know about the fighting, so don't ask.

123
00:11:35,423 --> 00:11:36,390
为什么？
Why not?

124
00:11:36,924 --> 00:11:38,482
我叫你别问我
Didn't I just say, "Don't ask"?

125
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:44,865
你像个小孩，我解释给你听
You look like you're about 12, so let me explain something to you.

我有一种特殊才能，不必打仗

00:12:29,977 --> 00:12:31,740
一枪就射穿引擎
Single shot through the engine block.

135
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,142
真可惜，那辆吉普车很帅
Shit, that's a shame. That was a nice jeep.

136
00:12:59,006 --> 00:13:01,270
停火
Cease fire! Cease fire!

137
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:02,976
检查武器
Check your weapons!

138
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:03,908
艾中士
Sergeant Eversmann.

139
00:13:08,516 --> 00:13:09,949
我是一等兵贝克朋
Private First Class Blackburn.

140
00:13:10,518 --> 00:13:11,485
什么事？
Yeah?

141
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:13,043
我来报到
Reporting for duty.

142
00:13:13,521 --> 00:13:17,821
你要向毕中尉报到，他应该就在附近
Not to me. You're reporting to Lt. Beales. He should be here somewhere.

143
00:13:18,025 --> 00:13:19,117
我把他交给你
Can I leave him with you?

144
00:13:20,528 --> 00:13:22,496
好吧
Yeah, go ahead.

145
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,395
-你把枪带来了 -是，长官
-You brought your weapon. -Yes, sir.

146
00:13:25,032 --> 00:13:26,795
我不累，我能练靶吗？
Want me to shoot? I'm rested.

147
00:13:27,034 --> 00:13:29,901
-你几时到？ -刚才
-When did you get in? -Just now, Sergeant.

148
00:13:35,042 --> 00:13:36,100
谁饿了？
Hey, who's hungry?

149
00:13:58,566 --> 00:14:01,865
这算什么？纳税人出钱的狩猎大餐吗？
What is this, Sarg'nt? Another taxpayer-funded Delta safari?

150
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:05,038
-盖将军问起可别说 -我问起呢？
-Not if General Garrison is asking. -I'm asking.

151
00:14:06,073 --> 00:14:07,540
用餐愉快，上尉
Have a nice meal, Captain.

152
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,810
-大家都在排队 -我知道
-Hey, man, there's a line. -I know.

153
00:14:15,082 --> 00:14:18,449
-你这是插队 -我也知道
-Well, this isn't the back of it. -Yeah, I know.

154
00:14:20,087 --> 00:14:22,248
中士
Sergeant. Sergeant.

155
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,750
这干嘛？
What's going on here?

156
00:14:24,091 --> 00:14:27,026
我们在练靶，打到一只野猪
Some aerial target practice, sir. Didn't want to leave it behind.

157
00:14:27,094 --> 00:14:29,221
我是说你的步枪
I'm talking about your weapon.

158
00:14:29,597 --> 00:14:32,031
反恐怖部队也不能拿上膛的步枪到处晃
Delta or no Delta, that's a hot weapon.

159
00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:35,364
你应该很清楚，枪要随时上保险
You know better than that. Safety should be on at all times on base.

160
00:14:35,603 --> 00:14:37,935
这就是我的“保险”
Well, this is my safety, sir.

161
00:14:40,608 --> 00:14:43,543
别管他，他两天没吃饭了
Let it go, sir. The guy hasn't eaten in a couple of days.

162
00:14:43,611 --> 00:14:46,375
反恐怖部队都是一群蛮牛
You Delta boys are a bunch of undisciplined cowboys.

163
00:14:47,615 --> 00:14:49,412
让我告诉你
Let me tell you something, Sarg'nt.

164
00:14:49,617 --> 00:14:53,053
到了前线你需要游骑兵支援
When we get on a five-yard line, you're going to need my Rangers.

165
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,145
你最好有点团队精神
Y'all better learn to be team players.

166
00:14:57,124 --> 00:14:58,591
我说完了
We're done here.

167
00:15:08,135 --> 00:15:11,593
说呀，你说这是保险
Speak up. You say this is your safety?

168
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:13,936
这是我的靴子
Well, this is my boot, son.

169
00:15:14,642 --> 00:15:17,975
小心我用这只靴子把你踢爆
And it will fit up your ass with the proper amount of force.

170
00:15:18,145 --> 00:15:21,740
-这算新泽西口音吗？ -拜托，我很努力耶
-ls that a Jersey accent? -I'm trying to do this, give me a break.

171
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:23,980
把太阳眼镜脱掉
Take those sunglasses off.

172
00:15:24,151 --> 00:15:26,449
反恐怖部队爱戴名牌墨镜，那是他们的事
Delta wants to wear Oakleys, that's their business.

173
00:15:26,654 --> 00:15:28,849
别让我再看到你戴
I don't want to see them on you again.

174
00:15:30,658 --> 00:15:32,319
那是一把上膛的步枪？
Is that a hot Weapon?

175
00:15:37,665 --> 00:15:38,996
你下了吗？
Is that your move?

176
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,997
手还没离棋啊？
Is my hand on the piece?

177
00:15:41,168 --> 00:15:43,534
再下三步我就赢了
I can mate you in three whatever you do.

178
00:15:45,172 --> 00:15:48,437
你自己最好小心点
I'd keep my eye on that queen before counseling others.

179
00:15:49,176 --> 00:15:51,076
有种就放马过来
Well, she's just lying in wait.

180
00:15:55,182 --> 00:15:56,149
唉
Yikes.

181
00:15:58,185 --> 00:16:01,154
你画得越来越好了
It's good. You're really improving.

182
00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:04,249
不过我有一个建议
If I may make a suggestion-- Observation.

183
00:16:04,692 --> 00:16:05,659
说吧
Go ahead.

184
00:16:05,693 --> 00:16:07,991
-这是童话故事，对吧？ -没错
-It's a children's book, right? -Right.

185
00:16:08,696 --> 00:16:12,792
这会把小孩子吓得屁滚尿流
They are not supposed to scare the living shit out of the children.

186
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,636
骑士正要屠龙
This is the part of the story where our knight is slaying the dragon.

187
00:16:16,704 --> 00:16:19,298
本来就很可怕，而且我女儿最喜欢了
That's scary. Besides, my daughter loves this stuff.

188
00:16:19,707 --> 00:16:21,641
我以为你上礼拜就画完了
Thought you finished that last week.

189
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:23,437
你说完了吗？
You done?

190
00:16:25,212 --> 00:16:28,670
就快冲到十码线了
Hey, we are at the 10-yard line here, men.

191
00:16:28,716 --> 00:16:30,183
明白吗？
You understand?

192
00:16:30,718 --> 00:16:33,186
你会数吗？1、2、3
Can you count? One, two, ten.

193
00:16:33,721 --> 00:16:35,848
我的后卫呢？
Okay? Where are my running backs?

194
00:16:36,223 --> 00:16:37,986
我的后卫呢？
Where are my running backs?

195
00:16:39,226 --> 00:16:42,320
我没看到你做礼拜
Hey, I didn't see you at church on Sunday.

196
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,630
你有别的事吗？
You had something more important to do?

197
00:16:44,732 --> 00:16:47,132
礼拜天一定要做礼拜
Not on Sunday, you don't. Not anymore.

198
00:16:47,234 --> 00:16:49,498
别给我落跑，了解吗？
I will make you believe, you understand?

199
00:17:04,752 --> 00:17:06,117
很好笑，呼吓
Pretty funny, hoo-ah?

200
00:17:09,256 --> 00:17:12,748
你学得很像，很像我
It was a good impression. I recognize myself.

201
00:17:15,262 --> 00:17:17,025
继续吧
All right, carry on.

202
00:17:17,765 --> 00:17:20,563
-我要跟你讲话 -是，长官
-I'd like a word, specialist. -Sir.

203
00:17:21,268 --> 00:17:24,726
你知道谁有指挥权吧？
You understand why we have a chain of command, don't you?

204
00:17:25,272 --> 00:17:26,102
知道，长官
Roger that, sir.

205
00:17:26,273 --> 00:17:29,674
你敢再取笑我，我就命令你把马桶舔干净
If you ever undermine me again, you'll clean latrines with your tongue...

206
00:17:29,777 --> 00:17:32,712
保证你一个月吃不下饭
...till you taste no difference between shit and French fries.

207
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,712
-明白吗？ -明白，长官
-Are we clear? -Hoo-ah, sir.

208
00:17:33,781 --> 00:17:34,679
好吧
All right.

209
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,722
听好：
Listen to this:

210
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:48,524
当一个索马利亚人杀了人 他的部落就欠对方部落一百只骆驼
If one skinny kills another his clan owes the dead guy's clan a hundred camels.

211
00:17:48,796 --> 00:17:49,956
一百只骆驼
A hundred camels.

212
00:17:50,297 --> 00:17:52,492
我连一只都不给
Camels. I wouldn't pay one camel.

213
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,200
这儿的骆驼欠债一定很多
Must be a lot of fucking camel debt.

214
00:17:55,803 --> 00:17:57,634
这是真的吗？
Is that really true, Lieutenant?

215
00:17:57,805 --> 00:17:59,773
去问艾士官，他喜欢非洲人
Ask Sgt. Eversmann. He likes skinnies.

216
00:18:00,307 --> 00:18:02,867
艾士官，那是真的吗？
Sgt. Eversmann, you really like the skinnies?

217
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,973
不是喜欢不喜欢的问题，我尊敬他们
It's not that I like them or I don't like them. I respect them.

218
00:18:07,314 --> 00:18:11,444
你们要知道艾士官很有理想
See, what you guys fail to realize is the sergeant is a bit of an idealist.

219
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:15,686
他相信这项任务的使命，对吧，士官？
He believes in this mission down to his bones. Don't you, Sergeant?

220
00:18:15,823 --> 00:18:19,054
这些人没有工作
Look, these people, they have no jobs...

221
00:18:19,326 --> 00:18:23,262
没有食物、教育和未来
...no food, no education, no future.

222
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,891
我只是觉得我们有两个选择
I just figure that, I mean, we have two things that we can do.

223
00:18:27,334 --> 00:18:28,767
帮助他们
We can help...

224
00:18:28,836 --> 00:18:32,237
或是眼睁睁看着他们自相残杀
...or we can sit back and watch the country destroy itself on CNN.

225
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:33,271
对吧？
Right?

226
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:36,776
我不知道，我是来打仗的
I don't know about you guys, but I was trained to fight.

227
00:18:36,844 --> 00:18:38,812
你不是吗？
Are you trained to fight, Sergeant?

228
00:18:38,846 --> 00:18:41,610
我是来改善世界的
Well, I think I was trained to make a difference, Kurth.

229
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,182
他真的很有理想
Like the man said, he's an idealist.

230
00:18:46,854 --> 00:18:48,879
等等，我最爱这一段
Oh, wait. This is my favorite part.

231
00:18:54,361 --> 00:18:56,192
滚远一点
Stay aWay from the cans!

232
00:18:56,864 --> 00:18:59,196
去死吧，猪头
Die, gas-pumper!

233
00:18:59,867 --> 00:19:01,630
给我滚远一点
Stay aWay from those cans!

234
00:19:06,373 --> 00:19:08,432
不，退后
No, no, stay back.

235
00:19:08,876 --> 00:19:11,777
他的癫痫症发作了，拿东西让他咬着
He's having a seizure. Put something in his mouth.

236
00:19:11,879 --> 00:19:16,782
约翰，没事了…没事了…
John, it's okay. John, it's okay. It's okay.

237
00:19:18,385 --> 00:19:25,587
清晨5:45，10月3日　星期天

238
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,928
他没事了，不过他得退伍
Well, he'll be fine. But not in this army.

239
00:20:07,134 --> 00:20:09,762
他有癫痫症，我要送他回家
He's out of the game. He's epileptic, going home.

240
00:20:14,141 --> 00:20:16,701
我要你当小队长
I'm putting you in charge of his chalk.

241
00:20:17,144 --> 00:20:19,942
-你有意见吗？ -没有，长官
-You got a problem with that? -No, sir.

242
00:20:20,147 --> 00:20:22,081
这个责任很重大
It's a big responsibility.

243
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:24,674
你的弟兄都仰赖你
Your men will look to you to make the right decisions.

244
00:20:25,152 --> 00:20:27,177
他们的命都在你手上
Their lives depend on it.

245
00:20:28,155 --> 00:20:29,349
好了
All right.

246
00:20:30,157 --> 00:20:33,092
-游骑兵做先锋 -勇往直前
-Rangers lead the way, sir. -All the way.

247
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,559
祝好运
Good luck.

248
00:20:37,664 --> 00:20:42,533

A meeting of Aidid's senior cabinet may take place today at 1500 hours,

250
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,372
我说可能是因为…
I say "may" because we all know by now...

251
00:21:26,713 --> 00:21:29,944
根据目前的情报，一切都不确定
...with the intel we get on the street, nothing is certain.

252
00:21:30,217 --> 00:21:33,015
这是三方确定的情报
This is actual intel confirmed by three sources.

253
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,746
两名高层阁员可能会在场

哈珊奥威利，内政部长
...and Abdi Hassan Awale, interior minister.

256
00:21:44,231 --> 00:21:46,199
他们是我们的目标
These are the guys we're after.

257
00:21:47,234 --> 00:21:48,565
今天就行动

Lt. Colonel McKnight's humvee column will drive in at 1547...

267
00:22:16,763 --> 00:22:20,665
停在奥林匹克旅馆前
...on Hawlwadig Road and hold just short of the Olympic Hotel.

268
00:22:21,268 --> 00:22:22,701
等待指令
Wait for the green light.

269
00:22:22,769 --> 00:22:24,600
当反恐怖部队突击成功
Now once Delta gives the word...

270
00:22:24,771 --> 00:22:29,401
麦中校的手下就把人犯架上车
...McKnight's column will go to the target and load the prisoners onto trucks.

271
00:22:30,277 --> 00:22:32,609
把人犯架上车后
lmmediately after the prisoners are loaded...

272
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:36,715
游骑兵队员立刻到目标大楼集合
...the four Ranger chalks will collapse back to the target building...

273
00:22:36,783 --> 00:22:38,114
一起上悍马车队
...load up on humvees...

274
00:22:38,785 --> 00:22:42,619
地面部队就一路赶回基地
...and the entire ground force will exfil the 3 miles back to base.

275
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:45,986
行动时间只有半小时
Mission time, no longer than 30 minutes.

276
00:22:47,294 --> 00:22:52,095
我请求调动装甲车和AC-130炮艇机支援
Now, I had requested light armor and AC-130 Spectre gunships...

277
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:56,235
但华府却不同意
...but Washington, in all its wisdom, decided against this.

278
00:22:56,303 --> 00:22:58,100
太显眼了
Too high-profile.

279
00:22:58,305 --> 00:23:01,399
准备多管机枪的黑鹰直升机
So Black Hawks and Little Birds will provide the air cover...

280
00:23:01,808 --> 00:23:03,935
将提供空中支援
...with miniguns and 2.75 rockets.

281
00:23:04,311 --> 00:23:05,642
哈上校
Colonel Harrell.

282
00:23:05,812 --> 00:23:10,112
马上校负责调派空中支援
In the C-2 bird, Colonel Matthews will coordinate the air mission...

283
00:23:10,817 --> 00:23:13,615
我负责指挥地面部队
...and I will coordinate ground forces.

284
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,082
马上校
Colonel Matthews.

285
00:23:15,322 --> 00:23:18,587
任务执行代号是艾琳
Mission launch code word is lrene.

286
00:23:18,825 --> 00:23:19,792
有问题吗？
Questions?

287
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:24,627
目标是哪栋建筑？
Which building is it, sir?

288
00:23:25,332 --> 00:23:28,893
巴卡拉市集附近的建筑物
We're confirming that now. Somewhere near the Bakara market.

289
00:23:31,338 --> 00:23:34,273
我不能决定他们在哪里开会
I don't choose the time or place of their meetings.

290
00:23:34,341 --> 00:23:36,104
我没这么说
I didn't say a word, sir.

291
00:23:36,843 --> 00:23:39,778
大家听好，你们到了市集
Make no mistake, once you're in the Bakara market...

292
00:23:39,846 --> 00:23:42,212
就等于进入敌区
...you're in an entirely hostile district.

293
00:23:42,849 --> 00:23:45,181
千万别低估敌人实力
Don't underestimate their capabilities.

294
00:23:45,852 --> 00:23:49,288
进入市集之前都不是敌区
We'll be in friendly neighborhoods before we hit the market...

295
00:23:49,356 --> 00:23:54,020
千万切记交战法则，遭到攻击才能反击
...so remember the rules of engagement: No one fires unless fired upon.

296
00:23:54,361 --> 00:23:56,591
完成任务吧
Now, let's go get this thing done.

297
00:23:57,364 --> 00:23:58,956
祝好运，各位
Good luck, gentlemen.

298
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:07,272
怎么了？你不满意吗？
What's the matter, Danny? Something you don't like?

299
00:24:07,374 --> 00:24:09,501
没有C-炮艇机，白天出任务
No Spectre gunships, daylight instead of night...

300
00:24:09,876 --> 00:24:12,276
敌人的精神在下午特别亢奋
...afternoon when they're all fucked up on khat...

301
00:24:12,379 --> 00:24:16,509
那儿又是火力集中的敌区
...only part of the city Aidid can mount a counter-attack on short notice....

302
00:24:16,883 --> 00:24:19,750
-我有什么不满意的？ -人生不如意十有八九
-What's not to like? -Life's imperfect.

303
00:24:19,886 --> 00:24:23,583
你们在半空中只是不如意
For you two, circling above it at 500 feet, it's imperfect.

304
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:27,519
我们在地面就苦不堪言
Down in the street, it's unforgiving.

305
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,192
搞什么？
What the fuck, Smith?

306
00:25:05,932 --> 00:25:07,797
-怎样？ -什么怎样？
-Well? -Well, what?

307
00:25:07,934 --> 00:25:09,367
我们要行动吗？
We going?

308
00:25:10,937 --> 00:25:14,634
-我干嘛告诉你 -你就是要说
-Why should I tell you that? -Because I'm me.

309
00:25:15,942 --> 00:25:19,571
对，下午三点，市中心
Yeah. 3:00. Downtown.

310
00:25:19,946 --> 00:25:21,413
-巴卡拉市集 -好耶
-Bakara market. -All right.

311
00:25:21,948 --> 00:25:25,748
小史，我要你全力支持我
Listen, Smith, I need you to back me up out there today, all right?

312
00:25:25,952 --> 00:25:27,112
提高警觉
Keep sharp.

313
00:25:29,456 --> 00:25:31,549
遵命，艾士官
Yes, sir, Sergeant Eversmann.

314
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:34,290
这次行动是小意思啦
Ev, it's going to be nothing, man.

315
00:25:34,961 --> 00:25:36,223
小意思
Nothing.

316
00:25:38,965 --> 00:25:44,267
关键是磨咖啡豆，不能磨得太细或太粗
It's all in the grind, Sizemore. Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.

317
00:25:44,971 --> 00:25:47,098
这是一种技巧
This, my friend, is a science.

318
00:25:47,974 --> 00:25:50,772
我可是相信征兵广告的那种人
You're looking at the guy that believed the commercials.

319
00:25:50,977 --> 00:25:53,070
尽忠报国
About "be all you can be."

320
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,244
但是我在波湾战争都在煮咖啡
I made coffee through Desert Storm.

321
00:25:56,483 --> 00:25:59,646
在巴拿马也煮咖啡，别的游骑兵队员
I made coffee through Panama, while everyone else got to fight...

322
00:25:59,986 --> 00:26:01,783
都出生入死
...got to be a Ranger.

323
00:26:02,489 --> 00:26:07,290
我却只能煮黑咖啡，替别人拿奶精
Now it's "Grimesy, black, one sugar" or "Grimesy, got a powdered anywhere?"

324
00:26:11,498 --> 00:26:13,966
-怎么了？ -乒乓球受伤
-What happened to you? -Ping-Pong accident.

325
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,967
什么？
What?

326
00:26:16,002 --> 00:26:17,333
猜怎么着？
So guess what.

327
00:26:18,004 --> 00:26:20,734
你的愿望实现了，你要出任务
Your wish has been granted. You're going out today.

328
00:26:21,007 --> 00:26:22,565
少唬烂我
You're fucking me.

329
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:25,409
你要代替我负责有装备枪榴弹的M-步枪
You're taking my place assisting the 60 gunner.

330
00:26:25,512 --> 00:26:28,640
艾士官叫你收拾好装备
Sergeant Eversmann said to get your stuff and get ready.

331
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,950
你想要打仗，不是吗？
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

332
00:26:32,018 --> 00:26:33,315
是啊
Oh, yeah.

333
00:26:35,021 --> 00:26:36,045
当然了
Hell, yeah.

334
00:26:36,523 --> 00:26:39,959
葛姆，跟着瓦德给他弹药
Grimesy, stick with Waddell and give him ammo when he needs it.

335
00:26:40,026 --> 00:26:41,288
-呼吓？ -呼吓
-Hoo-ah? -Hoo-ah.

336
00:26:41,528 --> 00:26:45,988
别担心，索利亚人的枪法都很烂
I wouldn't worry about that. Generally speaking, Somalis can't shoot for shit.

337
00:26:46,533 --> 00:26:50,435
小心别被他们的石头K到就行
Just watch out for the sammys throwing the rocks, and you'll be fine.

338
00:26:50,537 --> 00:26:51,469
会好玩的
Might even be fun.

339
00:26:51,538 --> 00:26:55,406
让反恐怖部队打头阵，我们只要支援他们
D-boys do their thing now. All we got to do is cover them.

340
00:26:55,542 --> 00:26:58,375
直升机也会掩护我们
Choppers going to cover us, and we'll be all right.

341
00:26:59,546 --> 00:27:03,380
我知道我是第一次当小队长
Look, you guys, this is my first time as chalk leader...

342
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:06,917
但我们不是第一次出任务
...but, this isn't our first time out together. This is serious.

343
00:27:07,053 --> 00:27:10,454
我们是游骑兵，不是预备军官
We're Rangers, not some sorry-ass JROTC.

344
00:27:11,057 --> 00:27:12,285
我们是精英部队
We're elite.

345
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:15,152
大家要好好表现
Let's act like it out there. Hoo-ah?

346
00:27:16,563 --> 00:27:18,224
有问题吗？
Any questions?

347
00:27:24,571 --> 00:27:26,198
我们不会有事的
We're going to be okay.

348
00:27:27,073 --> 00:27:28,870
收拾好装备，出动吧
Grab your gear. Let's move out.

349
00:27:49,095 --> 00:27:53,054
你不需要水壶，很快就会回来
You're not going to need that, dude. We're not out there long enough.

350
00:28:01,107 --> 00:28:02,472
那也用不着
You won't need that, either.

351
00:28:03,109 --> 00:28:04,940
天黑前就会回来
We'll be back before dark.

352
00:28:05,111 --> 00:28:07,636
你不如多带大麻和啤酒
You might as well take dope and beer instead.

353
00:28:08,114 --> 00:28:09,376
什么？
What?

354
00:28:09,616 --> 00:28:11,516
弹药啦，多带弹药啦
Ammo, dude. Take ammo.

355
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:22,458
你身上有五十磅的装备
Let me tell you something, Grimes. You got 50 pounds of gear.

356
00:28:22,629 --> 00:28:23,561
不必多加十二磅
You don't need another 12.

357
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:28,033
背这么重想逃命都逃不了
I don't know about you, I don't plan on getting shot running away.

358
00:28:28,134 --> 00:28:29,624
我还是要穿防弹背心
Well, I better keep mine in.

359
00:28:30,136 --> 00:28:30,966
葛姆
Grimes.

360
00:28:31,137 --> 00:28:33,071
最重要的是
Most important thing:

361
00:28:33,139 --> 00:28:36,370
跟着大家射击的方向开枪
Remember, when everyone is shooting, shoot in the same direction.

362
00:28:44,651 --> 00:28:48,314
你看，他在靴子帖上血型
Look at this. He's taping his blood type to his boots.

363
00:28:48,655 --> 00:28:52,147
-触霉头 -很聪明
-That's bad luck. -No, it's smart.

364
00:28:52,659 --> 00:28:54,422
反恐怖部队都这么做
All Delta do that.

365
00:28:55,161 --> 00:28:57,129
写遗书也很倒霉
That's bad luck too, man.

366
00:28:57,664 --> 00:28:58,756
快走吧
Come on, let's go.

367
00:29:02,168 --> 00:29:04,966
幸好你不是左撇子
It's a good thing you're right-handed, Adonis.

368
00:29:07,173 --> 00:29:11,303
-要不然你就没搞头了 -你真会说笑
-lf not, I don't know what you'd do. -You're a funny guy, man.

369
00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:15,943
-我不替你拿遗书 -我们说好的
-I'm not taking no death letter. -We have a deal.

370
00:29:18,685 --> 00:29:20,653
一小时后还给你
I'll give it to you back in an hour.

371
00:29:21,187 --> 00:29:25,351
-贝克朋，你还好吧？ -我很兴奋
-Blackburn, you okay? -Excited.

372
00:29:26,693 --> 00:29:30,151
这是好事我当兵就是为了打仗
In a good way. I've been training my whole life for this.

373
00:29:30,697 --> 00:29:32,688
你杀过人吗？
You ever shot at anybody before?

374
00:29:33,199 --> 00:29:34,166
没有
No, sir.

375
00:29:35,702 --> 00:29:36,896
我也没有
Me neither.

376
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,073
下午2点29分

377
00:30:11,237 --> 00:30:12,670
他可靠吗？
Think he's reliable?

378
00:30:12,739 --> 00:30:16,197
等着瞧吧，他第一次出任务
Well, we'll see. It's his first time out.

379
00:30:16,743 --> 00:30:18,711
<font size=18 color=#00d8f8>联合行动指挥中心

380
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,684
-叫他把收音机关掉 -是，长官
-Tell him to turn his damn radio off. -Yes, sir.

381
00:30:26,753 --> 00:30:28,550
叫他把收音机关掉
Tell him to turn his radio off.

382
00:30:28,755 --> 00:30:31,724
阿弟，把收音机关掉
Abdi, you need to turn your radio off.

383
00:30:38,264 --> 00:30:42,894
这是史黛芬和蓝迪，请留言，谢谢
Hi, You've reached Stephanie and Randy, leave us a message, Thank you,

384
00:30:45,271 --> 00:30:47,671
老婆，是我，你在吗？
Hey, baby, it's me, Are you there?

385
00:30:49,275 --> 00:30:51,175
你在的话就快接
Pick up if you're there,

386
00:30:51,778 --> 00:30:54,713
我只是打来看你好不好
I'm just calling to make sure everything's all right.

387
00:30:55,281 --> 00:30:57,681
过两小时再打给你
I'll call you in a couple hours.

388
00:30:58,785 --> 00:31:00,650
你最好别睡着了
You'd better not be sleeping.

389
00:31:01,788 --> 00:31:03,050
该你了，蓝迪
Your move, Randy.

390
00:31:04,791 --> 00:31:06,281
我好想你
I'm missing you,

391
00:31:07,293 --> 00:31:09,022
我爱你
I love you, baby.

392
00:31:10,797 --> 00:31:12,094
喂？
Hello? Hello?

393
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,494
谢了
Thanks, bud.

394
00:31:17,804 --> 00:31:19,669
这有点好笑
You know, it's kind of funny.

395
00:31:20,306 --> 00:31:23,366
洁白的沙滩，灿烂的阳光
Beautiful beach, beautiful sun.

396
00:31:24,811 --> 00:31:27,075
几乎是一个好地方
Could almost be a good place to visit.

397
00:31:27,313 --> 00:31:28,678
几乎
Almost.

398
00:31:32,318 --> 00:31:34,411
你认为我们不该来
You don't think we should be here.

399
00:31:35,321 --> 00:31:39,724
你知道我怎么想吗？我怎么想不重要
You know what I think? It don't really matter what I think.

400
00:31:41,327 --> 00:31:45,661
第一颗子弹从你头上呼啸而过
Once that first bullet goes past your head, politics and all that shit...

401
00:31:45,832 --> 00:31:47,925
那些狗屁倒灶的事都不重要
...just goes right out the window.

402
00:31:48,334 --> 00:31:50,461
我只想完成任务
I just want to do it right today.

403
00:31:51,337 --> 00:31:55,137
打起精神，让弟兄活着回来
Just watch your corner. Get all your men back here alive.

404
00:32:20,366 --> 00:32:24,166
就是这里还是汽车抛锚？
Now, is this supposed to be the place, or did his car just take a dump?

405
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,769
阿弟，请回答
Abdi, come in,

406
00:32:26,372 --> 00:32:28,806
你听到吗？这是目标吗？
Abdi, can you hear me? Is this the place?

407
00:32:33,379 --> 00:32:34,539
阿弟
Abdi, come in,

408
00:32:39,886 --> 00:32:42,446
听到吗？
Can you hear me? Abdi,

409
00:32:42,889 --> 00:32:45,858
请回答，是这里吗？
Abdi, come in, Is this the place?

410
00:32:46,392 --> 00:32:48,826
我右手边，咖啡厅楼上
To my right side, above the cafe.

411
00:32:48,895 --> 00:32:51,125
他说就是这里
He says this is the building,

412
00:32:51,397 --> 00:32:52,796
他确定？
He's certain?

413
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:55,196
阿弟，你要确定才行
Abdi, you need to be sure,

414
00:32:55,902 --> 00:32:57,233
你确定？
Are you sure?

415
00:32:58,905 --> 00:33:03,205
目标在我左边两条街口外
Well, it's down the road, two blocks over on my left.

416
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:05,741
不过民兵太多了
But there's too many militia.

417
00:33:06,412 --> 00:33:08,710
我一靠近他们就会开枪
If I go closer, they might shoot me,

418
00:33:08,915 --> 00:33:12,009
他说目标在两个街口外
NoW he's saying the building's a couple blocks doWn,,,

419
00:33:12,418 --> 00:33:14,750
不过他怕对方会向他开枪
...but if he's seen outside it, he'll be shot.

420
00:33:15,421 --> 00:33:17,548
我才会宰了他
I'll fucking shoot him myself.

421
00:33:17,924 --> 00:33:21,360
叫他把车子停在目标门口
Tell him I want his skinny ass parked in front of the building.

422
00:33:21,427 --> 00:33:24,555
他不去就拿不到钱
He's not getting paid till he does exactly that.

423
00:33:24,931 --> 00:33:28,094
离目标三哩，不要走小路
Three miles to the target. We're never off the main roads.

424
00:33:28,434 --> 00:33:31,369
到了圆环先向北然后往东
At K-four traffic circle, we turn north, then east on National...

425
00:33:31,437 --> 00:33:34,565
在那儿等候劫出人犯
...and we wait until extraction of prisoners is complete here.

426
00:33:34,941 --> 00:33:36,875
然后全队开进
Then we roll up in force on Hawlwadig...

427
00:33:36,943 --> 00:33:40,344
把人犯跟地面部队载回来
...load the prisoners, the assault-blocking forces and bring them back.

428
00:33:40,947 --> 00:33:43,074
一小时后回基地
Home in an hour. Okay?

429
00:33:43,449 --> 00:33:46,714
敌人会反击，那儿就像西部电影一样
There will be some shooting. Bakara market is the Wild West.

430
00:33:46,953 --> 00:33:50,184
小心开枪，那儿有平民
But be careful what you shoot at. People do live there.

431
00:33:50,957 --> 00:33:52,185
呼吓
Hoo-ah.

432
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:08,134
上一个线民玩俄罗斯轮盘搁屁了
Last one of these guys shot himself in the head playing Russian roulette.

433
00:34:21,988 --> 00:34:24,252
长官，他停车了
Sir, the vehicle is stopped,

434
00:34:24,991 --> 00:34:28,358
这就是目标，他确定吗？
So this is the real deal now. He's sure this time.

435
00:34:29,495 --> 00:34:33,556
-他吓得屁滚尿流 -好，好现象
-He sounds scared shitless, -Good. That's always a good sign.

436
00:34:45,011 --> 00:34:46,945
这就是我们的信号
That's it, That's our signal,

437
00:34:47,013 --> 00:34:48,310
好
All right.

438
00:34:49,015 --> 00:34:51,745
要所有飞机离开该空域
All QRF out of the airspace.

439
00:34:53,019 --> 00:34:55,112
出动快速反应部队

447
00:35:45,071 --> 00:35:46,436
小心点
Be careful.

448
00:35:47,073 --> 00:35:49,098
决不抛弃同胞
No one gets left behind.

449
00:35:51,077 --> 00:35:52,339
怎么了？
What's wrong?

450
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:56,207
他从没来道过别
Nothing. He's just never done that before.

451
00:35:57,583 --> 00:35:59,016
天杀的
Aw, fuck!

452

00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:42,643
通知民兵我们要来了

458
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:48,149
看来地面有平民

459
00:39:48,353 --> 00:39:51,322

675
00:57:21,921 --> 00:57:23,149
没事
Yeah!

676
00:57:24,924 --> 00:57:26,255
走吧，梅道
Let's go, Maddox.

677
00:57:26,926 --> 00:57:29,190
-指挥部，车队出发了 -收到
-C-2, convoy's moving out. -Roger that,

678
00:57:29,428 --> 00:57:31,953
麦道，看看这些猪头
Maddox, look at these jerks! These idiots!

679
00:57:32,431 --> 00:57:34,922
开快点，右转
Go, go! Right, Maddox, right!

680
00:57:44,443 --> 00:57:46,911
汤比，车队走了
Twombly, the convoy is leaving!

681
00:57:47,446 --> 00:57:49,209
嘿，汤比
Hey, Twombly!

682
00:57:49,949 --> 00:57:50,916
什么？
What?

683
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:53,418
-他们忘了我们 -什么？
-I think they've forgotten us. -What?

684
00:57:53,953 --> 00:57:55,420
算了
It doesn't matter.

685
00:58:02,962 --> 00:58:07,661
敌人从四面八方赶过去，我们要赶快支援他们
63 confirm, Skinnies are moving in on all sides, They need help noW,

686
00:58:08,968 --> 00:58:12,699
索马利亚人往坠机地点前进
Indigenous personnel advancing to Wolcott crash site,

687
00:58:14,473 --> 00:58:15,405
请重覆
Say again. Over.

688
00:58:15,474 --> 00:58:17,738
一大堆人蜂拥而上
A lot of people closing in,

689
00:58:19,979 --> 00:58:22,539
第四队离那儿有多远？
How far is Chalk Four from the crash site?

690
00:58:22,982 --> 00:58:26,042
-六个街口 -他们要快一点
-Six blocks, sir, -They need to haul ass.

691
00:59:20,039 --> 00:59:21,973
趴下来
Get down! Get down!

692
00:59:23,042 --> 00:59:24,703
史考帝，你没事吧？
Scotty, are you okay?

693
00:59:26,545 --> 00:59:27,978
别回去
No, don't go back!

694
00:59:38,057 --> 00:59:40,048
趴下来
Get down! Get down!

695
00:59:42,561 --> 00:59:43,789
武装车
Technicals!

696
00:59:44,063 --> 00:59:45,462
看到了
Got them!

697
00:59:52,571 --> 00:59:54,334
六点钟方向，快走
Six o'clock! Move, move!

698
01:00:16,595 --> 01:00:18,495
快…快…
Go, go, go!

699
01:00:24,103 --> 01:00:25,263
快走
Go, go!

Come on!

701
01:00:38,617 --> 01:00:40,278
尤利，走吧
Yurek, leaving!

01:00:43,122 --> 01:00:44,248
快点
Come on!

703
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:15,305
部队，左转
Uniform 64, left turn, Left turn,

704
01:02:16,215 --> 01:02:20,151
你要告诉我在哪条街左转
Romeo 64, I need to know before I get to the goddamn street!

705
01:02:20,219 --> 01:02:22,779
先停一下，情报有延误
You have to slow down. There's a delay.

706
01:02:23,222 --> 01:02:27,784
侦察队要先向指挥中心报告，然后再向我下令
From the time directions are relayed from surveillance to JOC, then to me.

707
01:02:28,227 --> 01:02:30,661
不能停，我们受到猛烈攻击
We can't slow down! We're taking heavy enemy fire!

708
01:02:30,729 --> 01:02:32,390
我们不能停下来
We can't slow down!

709
01:02:32,731 --> 01:02:36,565
我正收到侦察机的情报
Danny, I'm getting information from Orion surveillance above,

710
01:02:36,735 --> 01:02:39,431
快告诉我该怎么到坠机地点
So get me my fucking directions to the crash site!

711
01:02:39,738 --> 01:02:43,674
等一下，我看不到你的位置
Danny, hold on, I no longer have the best vieW of your route,

712
01:02:43,742 --> 01:02:46,210
快到正确位置呀
Get your ass in the right place, goddamn it!

713
01:02:46,745 --> 01:02:49,680
史崔克的车队情况如何？
What in the hell is the status of Struecker's humvees?

714
01:02:49,748 --> 01:02:52,649
车队几时会回到基地？
Colonel Harrell, ETA to base, Struecker's column.

715
01:02:53,252 --> 01:02:55,880

ETA to base momentarily,

716
01:03:02,761 --> 01:03:04,160
开门
Open the gate!

717
01:03:25,784 --> 01:03:28,344
-把他抬下车 -来
-Get him out! Let's go! Let's go! -Come on.

718
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:32,689
小心头
Watch his head.

719
01:03:32,791 --> 01:03:34,122
小心
Easy.

720
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,530
-贝克朋，你听到吗？ -找军医来
-Blackburn, can you hear me? -Get him to a medic.

721
01:04:19,338 --> 01:04:22,774
我们在坠机地点抢救伤者
Star 41 is at the crash site to evacuate the injured, Over,

722
01:04:22,841 --> 01:04:23,899

724
01:05:04,883 --> 01:05:06,043
小心
Easy.

725
01:05:13,392 --> 01:05:15,223
杰利顿，你没事吧？
Galentine, you all right?

726
01:05:15,394 --> 01:05:19,091
杰利顿、寇斯，跟我来
Galentine, Kurth, with me! Cover fire, now.

727
01:05:19,398 --> 01:05:20,956
掩护他们
Full cover!

728
01:05:35,414 --> 01:05:36,711
有几个人？
How many are in there?

729
01:05:36,915 --> 01:05:39,645
两名驾驶阵亡，两名人员受伤
Two pilots are dead, two crew chiefs are wounded!

730
01:05:39,918 --> 01:05:43,376
-他伤得很重，要把他救出来 -好，去吧
-He's hurt bad. We must get out of here. -All right. Go ahead.

731
01:06:15,666 --> 01:06:19,329
这是第四小队，你在开枪吗？
26, this is 25. Is that you shooting up the technicals?

732
01:06:20,671 --> 01:06:22,104
没错
This is 26. Roger that.

733
01:06:22,172 --> 01:06:26,165
狄马索，到东南边建立防线
DiTomasso, take the southeast corner. We're setting up a perimeter. Over.

734
01:06:26,677 --> 01:06:29,305
收到，马上赶过去
This is 26. Roger that. Moving there now.

735
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:30,942
出发
Move out!

736
01:06:33,684 --> 01:06:36,050
史上尉，请回答
Captain Steele, come in.

737
01:06:37,688 --> 01:06:39,519
请说
Go ahead, 25. This is 64.

738
01:06:39,690 --> 01:06:44,286
有两名伤者，两名直升机驾驶都阵亡了
We got two wounded and we got both the pilots dead in the chopper!

739
01:06:44,695 --> 01:06:46,253
请立刻派人接送伤兵
We need a medivac now!

740
01:06:47,197 --> 01:06:52,499
救援直升机没办法降落，你要先建立防线
It's too hot to land a bird. You must secure the perimeter first. Over.

741
01:06:53,203 --> 01:06:54,135
悍马车队呢？
Where are the humvees?

742
01:06:54,204 --> 01:06:57,139
车队一定会到
Be advised, 25, the convoy will be there.

743
01:06:57,207 --> 01:07:00,233
他们遭到猛烈攻击
They're encountering a lot of resistance. 64 out.

744
01:07:12,323 --> 01:07:15,986
-快架起机关枪 -坠机地点就在前面
-Get the 50 up! -You should see the crash directly ahead.

745
01:07:16,327 --> 01:07:18,761
前面只有路障
All I see is a roadblock!

746
01:07:19,830 --> 01:07:22,230
我会再找另一条路
I'll have to figure out another way.

747
01:07:47,358 --> 01:07:50,521
建立防线，把伤兵运走
Give me a defensive perimeter so we can load the wounded.

748
01:08:10,881 --> 01:08:12,542
快开枪呀
Fire your weapon, Othic!

749
01:08:24,395 --> 01:08:27,523
跟我女儿说叫她们安心
Tell my girls I'll be okay.

750
01:08:36,907 --> 01:08:38,374
医官
Medic!

751
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:40,502
呼吓！
Hoo-ah!

752
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,374

乔斯，帮我把他抬起来
Joyce! Joyce! Come on, help me pick him up!

754
01:09:17,448 --> 01:09:21,748
快帮我们逃走，坠机地点到底在哪儿？
Get us off this fucking street! Where's the crash site? Say again.

755
01:09:21,952 --> 01:09:25,080
直走两百米
Keep going straight 200 meters.

756
01:09:25,456 --> 01:09:26,548
收到
Roger that.

757
01:09:27,958 --> 01:09:29,220

Let's go!

758
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:31,928
快走吧
Let's go, goddamn it, let's go!

759
01:09:50,481 --> 01:09:52,972
汤比，过来
Hey, Twombles. Come here.

760
01:09:56,987 --> 01:09:59,251
车队不会回来了
The humvees ain't coming back, dude.

761
01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:01,048
什么？
What?

762
01:10:02,493 --> 01:10:04,358
我们要去找他们吗？
Were we supposed to go to them?

763
01:10:04,495 --> 01:10:06,554
我以为他们要来找我们
I thought they were coming to us.

764
01:10:08,999 --> 01:10:11,490
-我们应该去找他们 -该死
-I think we're supposed to go to them. -Shit.

765
01:10:14,505 --> 01:10:15,995
我们赶去坠机地点
Let's go to the crash site.

766
01:10:16,507 --> 01:10:17,439
好吧
Okay.

767
01:10:17,508 --> 01:10:20,909
别在我耳边开枪，我听不到了
Don't fire that thing so close to my head. I can barely hear as it is.

768
01:10:21,011 --> 01:10:21,943
出发
Move out.

769
01:10:35,025 --> 01:10:36,617
可恶，趴下来
Shit! Get down!

770
01:10:39,029 --> 01:10:42,487
我警告过你，别这么近
What did I just tell you? If you do that again--

771
01:10:46,537 --> 01:10:48,528
尼森，你没事吧？
You okay? Nelson.

772
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:51,804
你没事吧？
You all right?

773
01:10:52,042 --> 01:10:55,102
搜救直升机在现场进行救援
Search and rescue bird on station inserting medics.

774
01:11:07,057 --> 01:11:08,024
快走
Go!

775
01:11:12,563 --> 01:11:14,030
快，快
Go, go!

776
01:11:16,567 --> 01:11:19,968
C-2，这是68号，我被击中了
Son of a bitch. C-2, this is 68. We've been hit.

777
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:23,369
超级68号，你的螺旋翼冒烟
Super 68, there is smoke coming from the top of your rotor.

778
01:11:23,574 --> 01:11:25,599
-建议你立刻返航 -收到
-Advise you to come out now. -Roger.

779
01:11:26,076 --> 01:11:27,441
最后一个人员
Dropping last man.

780
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:34,278
我看到正前方有敌人拿着火箭筒，你看到吗？
Art, I've got skinnies with RPGs at 12:00. Can you see them?

781
01:11:34,585 --> 01:11:36,712
看到了，向左转九十度
Got them. Give me 90 degrees left.

782
01:11:47,097 --> 01:11:48,325
我要回去了

783
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:52,432
超级68号要回基地
Super 68 is out. Over.

784
01:12:02,613 --> 01:12:05,138
魏肯，情况如何？
Hey, Wilkie, what's the situation in there?

785
01:12:05,616 --> 01:12:07,413
两名驾驶都死了
Both pilots are dead.

786
01:12:08,118 --> 01:12:11,053
我们不能移动他们
25, we can't move these guys, Matty.

787
01:12:11,121 --> 01:12:12,918
他们会没命的
We'll kill them just carrying them.

788
01:12:13,123 --> 01:12:15,489
-就在这儿医治 -收到
-Stabilize in here? -Roger.

789

我们要在这儿进行医治

790
01:12:19,129 --> 01:12:21,188
收到，我们掩护你们
Understood, Wilkie. We got you covered. Over.

791
01:12:21,632 --> 01:12:25,090
超级64号，去替代超级61号
Super 64, come inbound and take Wolcott's position.

792
01:12:25,636 --> 01:12:27,934
收到，开进中
Roger. 64 is inbound.

793
01:12:55,165 --> 01:12:56,723
超级64号，你没事吧？
Super 64, you all right?

794
01:12:57,167 --> 01:12:59,931
这是超级64号，我没事
This is Super 64. We're good.

795
01:13:00,170 --> 01:13:03,003
确定吗？你的机身受损
You sure? You look like you got clipped pretty good.

796
01:13:03,173 --> 01:13:05,073
仪表板一切正常
lnstrument panels are okay.

797
01:13:05,175 --> 01:13:08,975
我们没事，机身有点晃动，不过没事
No, we're good. Got a slight vibration in the pedals, but we're good.

798
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:14,514
降落后进行检查以策安全
All right, put her down on the airfield, 64. Have it checked out just to be safe.

799
01:13:14,685 --> 01:13:15,652
收到
Roger.

800
01:13:18,689 --> 01:13:22,819
机身晃动得很厉害，再度检查系统
I'm getting movement in these pedals. Check the systems again.

801
01:13:37,708 --> 01:13:40,142
尾部螺旋翼失效
We lost the tail rotor! It's gone!

802
01:13:40,711 --> 01:13:42,372
64号要坠机

803
01:13:43,213 --> 01:13:44,680
64要坠机了

804
01:13:46,717 --> 01:13:48,412
我要坠机

805
01:13:53,223 --> 01:13:55,054
我们要坠机了
We're going down.

806
01:14:00,230 --> 01:14:02,095
快派史崔克的车队回去
Get Struecker's column back out there.

807
01:14:02,232 --> 01:14:04,496
叫他们赶到杜伦的坠机地点
They need to get to Durant's crash site fast.

808
01:14:04,735 --> 01:14:07,329
-有另一架直升机坠毁 -快去救他们
-Another bird down. -I want them out of there.

809
01:14:08,238 --> 01:14:09,170
全都救出来
All of them.

810
01:14:13,243 --> 01:14:16,337
史上尉，再不前进就会受困
Captain Steele, we got to move or we'll get pinned down!

811
01:14:16,747 --> 01:14:18,715
我们正在尽快前进
We're moving as fast as we can.

812
01:14:18,749 --> 01:14:21,877
你别管我的部队
You let me do my job and you do yours. Over.

813
01:14:30,761 --> 01:14:33,229
-哎呀 -路兹，趴下来
-Fuck! Fuck! -Ruiz stay down.

814
01:14:33,263 --> 01:14:34,195
-我就知道 -医官
-I fucking knew-- -Medic.

815
01:14:34,264 --> 01:14:37,995
去他的！史上尉，我来对付狙击手
Fuck this! Captain Steele, I'll take out the threat in the window.

816
01:14:38,268 --> 01:14:40,498
我们到灰色大楼集合
We'll rally at the gray building. Coming through.

817
01:14:40,771 --> 01:14:41,260
中士
Sarg'nt!

818
01:14:41,772 --> 01:14:42,864
好，走吧
All right, let's move!

819
01:14:48,779 --> 01:14:50,041
掩护我
Cover me!

820
01:14:55,786 --> 01:14:58,414
-快走吧 -快走
-Let's go, let's move! -Moving out.

821
01:15:04,294 --> 01:15:04,726
友军
Friendly!

822
01:15:04,795 --> 01:15:06,228
我是友军
Friendlies coming through!

823
01:15:06,296 --> 01:15:08,628
走吧，快走
Let's go, let's go! Move up!

824
01:15:09,299 --> 01:15:11,164
快…
Come on, come on!

825
01:15:11,301 --> 01:15:12,290
快…
Come on!

826
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:21,971
快走…快…
Move up! Go! Move up!

827
01:15:22,312 --> 01:15:24,007
你在干什么？
What the fuck are you doing out there?

828
01:15:24,314 --> 01:15:26,976
我们要赶到坠机地点
Doing my job! We got to get to that crash site!

829
01:15:27,317 --> 01:15:30,081
我们一定要赶到那条街
We got to get on that street, and we got to move!

830
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,379
你也要跟上来
And you have got to keep up, sir!

831
01:15:32,823 --> 01:15:34,757
别对我下令，中士
Don't you ever give me orders, Sergeant.

832
01:15:34,825 --> 01:15:37,259
我们没办法迎敌
We are combat ineffective, understand?

833
01:15:37,828 --> 01:15:39,261
太多伤兵了
We got too many wounded to move!

834
01:15:39,329 --> 01:15:42,526
让我带人手绕到坠机地点
Then give me some shooters and I'll circle us to the bird.

835
01:15:45,335 --> 01:15:47,803
葛姆，你在第四小队吗？
Grimes! You're with Chalk Four?

836
01:15:48,338 --> 01:15:49,305
是的，长官
Yes, sir!

837
01:15:49,339 --> 01:15:52,706
去跟反恐怖部队和艾中士会合
All right, hook up with Delta! Rejoin with Sergeant Eversmann.

838
01:15:53,343 --> 01:15:55,573
其他的人留守这里
The rest of you, secure this position!

839
01:15:55,846 --> 01:15:58,041
照顾伤兵，等待车队
Treat the wounded, we'll wait for the convoy!

840
01:15:58,348 --> 01:16:00,782
然后在坠机地点会合
Then we'll rally at the crash site. Roger!

841
01:16:00,851 --> 01:16:02,182
我的手下跟我走
My guys, let's go!

842
01:16:33,383 --> 01:16:36,352
两名反恐怖部队狙击手，舒哈和葛顿
C-2, I have two Delta snipers, Shughart and Gordon...

843
01:16:36,386 --> 01:16:39,048
自愿前往第二坠机地点
...volunteering to secure crash site two. Over.

844
01:16:39,389 --> 01:16:43,519
不准，不能再牺牲另一架直升机
No, Super 62, negative that request. Can't risk another bird.

845
01:16:45,395 --> 01:16:49,297
我们不能确定有人生还
We don't see anything moving down there, we don't even know if anyone's alive.

846
01:16:50,901 --> 01:16:53,597
地面部队正在赶去
A ground team is being organized to go in now.

847
01:16:53,904 --> 01:16:55,337
多久能赶到？
ETA on ground team? Over.

848
01:16:55,405 --> 01:16:58,397
不知道，不久吧
Unknown, not long.

849
01:16:58,909 --> 01:17:01,207
你们尽力从空中协助
Do what you can from the air.

850
01:17:05,415 --> 01:17:06,848
大家过来
All right, gather around!

851
01:17:06,917 --> 01:17:10,114
杜伦坠毁了，我们要去救他
Durant's 64 is down. We're going back in to get him!

852
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:12,354
你疯了，有人生还吗？
That's crazy. Is there anyone alive?

853
01:17:12,422 --> 01:17:14,788
无所谓，绝不能抛弃同胞
Doesn't matter, no one gets left behind.

854
01:17:15,425 --> 01:17:17,359
这是浪费时间
We're wasting time here.

855
01:17:17,427 --> 01:17:20,419
五分钟内重新整理弹药
Refit and max out ammo and grenades, you got five!

856
01:17:21,932 --> 01:17:23,729
塞斯莫，你想去哪儿？
Sizemore, where are you going?

857
01:17:23,934 --> 01:17:26,732
-跟你们一起走 -你受了伤不能去
-With you guys. -Not with that cast on you're not.

858
01:17:27,437 --> 01:17:30,668
好吧，去拿头盔吧
All right, all right, all right. Go get your k-pot.

859
01:17:32,943 --> 01:17:34,103
说话呀
Talk to me.

860
01:17:34,444 --> 01:17:35,775
我不能再回去
I can't go back out there.

861
01:17:35,946 --> 01:17:40,474
汤玛斯，大家都很害怕
Thomas, everyone feels the same way you do. All right?

862
01:17:40,951 --> 01:17:44,114
你现在的表现才重要
It's what you do right now that makes a difference.

863
01:17:44,955 --> 01:17:46,422
这是你的决定
It's your call.

864
01:17:46,957 --> 01:17:47,981
呼吓？
Hoo-ah?

865
01:17:53,964 --> 01:17:55,158
呼吓
Hoo-ah.

866
01:18:11,982 --> 01:18:15,577
最好把悍马车上的血迹冲掉
lt'll probably help to wash the blood out of the humvees.

867
01:18:24,494 --> 01:18:26,394
史崔克中士
Sergeant Struecker!

868
01:18:26,997 --> 01:18:30,296
我能去吗？
Sergeant Struecker! Can I go, Sarge?

869
01:18:31,001 --> 01:18:32,866
-你有弹药吗？ -有
-You got some ammo? -Roger, Sarge!

870
01:18:33,003 --> 01:18:34,561
上来吧
Hop in!

871
01:18:52,522 --> 01:18:53,853
等等
Wait!

872
01:18:54,524 --> 01:18:56,651
来吧，上车
Let's go, Thomas. Get in!

873
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:21,676
走哪儿？
Which way?

874
01:19:27,057 --> 01:19:30,026
-那儿吧 -别这么大声
-That way, I think! -Not so fucking loud.

875
01:20:03,593 --> 01:20:04,890
乖驴子
Nice donkey.

876
01:20:23,447 --> 01:20:24,812
游骑兵吗？
Rangers?

877
01:20:25,449 --> 01:20:26,416
你是谁？
Who?

878
01:20:27,451 --> 01:20:30,887
我是尤利啦，猪头
It's Yurek! You fucking assholes!

879
01:20:30,954 --> 01:20:32,319
靠
Fuck!

880
01:20:32,456 --> 01:20:34,981
我们差点杀死你
Dude, we almost fucking killed you!

881
01:20:35,459 --> 01:20:38,519
-你过来 -靠，你们过来
-Come to us! -Fuck you, come to me.

882
01:20:50,974 --> 01:20:52,271
对不起，中士
Sorry, Sarge!

883
01:20:52,476 --> 01:20:54,376
你上哪儿了？
Dude, where the fuck have you been?

884
01:20:54,478 --> 01:20:56,309
你带了夜视镜吗？
Never mind, you brought NOD, right?

885
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:58,778
没有，你知道原因吗？
No, I didn't and you want to know why?

886
01:20:58,982 --> 01:21:02,315
因为你说半小时就能回基地
Because you said: "You won't need that, we'll be back in a half-hour."

887
01:21:02,486 --> 01:21:03,919
我不是跟你说的
Well, I wasn't saying it to you.

888
01:21:03,987 --> 01:21:05,955
尼森，过来
Nelson, cover this way.

889
01:21:06,490 --> 01:21:07,923
我们需要夜视镜
We'll need night vision.

890
01:21:07,991 --> 01:21:10,357
你在等什么？
What's the matter with you?

891
01:21:10,994 --> 01:21:13,724
他聋了，都是我害的
Oh, he's deaf. It's my fault.

892
01:21:13,997 --> 01:21:15,931
-我们一定要走 -那儿
-We need to get out of here! -That way.

893
01:21:15,999 --> 01:21:19,628
离坠机地点不远了，在哪儿？
We can't be far from the crash. Which way?

894
01:21:20,504 --> 01:21:22,199
我以为你知道
I thought you might know.

895
01:21:23,006 --> 01:21:24,405
出发吧
Let's move out.

896
01:21:30,013 --> 01:21:32,538
尼森、汤比，请回答
Nelson, Twombly? Come in. Over.

897
01:21:33,517 --> 01:21:37,681
这是杰利顿，车队的位置在哪里？
Nelson, Twombly, this is Galentine. We need a position of the convoy. Over.

898
01:21:39,022 --> 01:21:41,252
我联络不到他们
I can't raise them, Sergeant.

899
01:21:41,525 --> 01:21:44,153
我们快撤退吧
Sir, let's get the fuck out of here and evac!

900
01:21:45,529 --> 01:21:48,555
-快走吧 -快回到据点
-Let's move out. -Back to the stronghold!

901
01:21:49,032 --> 01:21:49,999
走吧
Come on!

902
01:21:52,035 --> 01:21:55,232
地面部队占领几栋建筑物
Ground forces have occupied several buildings along Marehan Road...

903
01:21:55,539 --> 01:21:56,972
但是都分散开来
...but they're all spread out.

904
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:01,409
艾中士的第四小队在威考的坠机地点建立防线
Eversmann's Chalk Four has set up a perimeter around Wolcott's crash site.

905
01:22:02,045 --> 01:22:04,343
狄马索在隔壁的大楼
DiTomasso is in the adjacent structure.

906
01:22:04,548 --> 01:22:08,450
史上尉的游骑兵队员在这儿，两个街口外
Captain Steele and about 40 men, Rangers, are here, a couple blocks away.

907
01:22:08,552 --> 01:22:09,985
他们的情况很惨
They're banged up pretty bad.

908
01:22:10,053 --> 01:22:14,888
他设立了死伤聚集点，没办法前进
He set up a casualty collection point, I don't think they'll be able to move.

909
01:22:15,058 --> 01:22:17,526
桑德森中士率领手下
Sergeant Sanderson and a small Delta team...

910
01:22:17,561 --> 01:22:21,395
正在赶往坠机地点
...are moving from Steele's position to the crash site as we speak.

911
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,668
把炮火引开
Draw off fire!

912
01:22:34,077 --> 01:22:37,012
等对方装子弹就掩护我
When this asshole stops to reload, cover me!

913
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:38,479
-快 -长官
-Go! -Sir.

914
01:22:42,085 --> 01:22:43,017
再来
Again!

915
01:22:48,091 --> 01:22:49,524
掩护我
Loading!

916
01:22:52,095 --> 01:22:53,562
继续
Keep going!

917
01:22:54,097 --> 01:22:55,792
卡住了
I'm jammed!

918
01:22:57,100 --> 01:22:58,533
让我来
I got it!

919
01:23:00,103 --> 01:23:01,832
该死
No, shit!

920
01:23:14,117 --> 01:23:15,345
火箭弹
RPG!

921
01:23:30,634 --> 01:23:33,068
你没事吧？
You all right? You okay?

922
01:23:33,136 --> 01:23:36,105
没事，我死不了
Yeah. I can hear bells ringing.

923
01:23:37,641 --> 01:23:39,802
快，来吧
Come on! Come on!

924
01:23:41,645 --> 01:23:42,577
走吧
Go!

925
01:23:50,153 --> 01:23:53,088
有一群人正走向坠机地点
A crowd is advancing six, seven blocks from the crash.

926
01:23:53,156 --> 01:23:55,090
舒哈和葛顿再度请求
Shughart and Gordon again request permission...

927
01:23:55,158 --> 01:23:58,559
前往坠机地点进行救援
...to secure until convoy arrives. Over.

928
01:23:59,162 --> 01:24:02,097
人群增加到好几百人
General, crowds are in the hundreds now.

929
01:24:02,165 --> 01:24:05,566
他们看得会比我们清楚
From where they are, they can see things clearer than any of us.

930
01:24:05,669 --> 01:24:07,534
他们很清楚状况
They know what they're asking.

931
01:24:08,171 --> 01:24:09,638
让我跟他们说
Let me talk to them.

932
01:24:09,673 --> 01:24:10,605
这是盖将军
This is Garrison.

933
01:24:10,674 --> 01:24:14,906
我要确定你们很清楚状况，大声地说出来
I want to make sure that you understand what you're asking, so say it out loud.

934
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:21,139
我们要求在坠机地点建立防线
We're asking to go in and set up a perimeter until ground support arrives.

935
01:24:21,685 --> 01:24:25,815
支援部队没那么快赶到
You realize that I cannot tell you when that might be, it could take a while.

936
01:24:26,690 --> 01:24:29,124
-我知道 -你们还是要去？
-Roger that. -You still want to go in there?

937
01:24:29,192 --> 01:24:29,954
是，长官
Yes, sir.

938
01:24:34,197 --> 01:24:35,630
-哈中校 -是，将军
-Colonel Harrell? -Yes, General?

939
01:24:35,699 --> 01:24:36,723
这是你的决定
It's your call.

940
01:24:38,201 --> 01:24:39,668
收到
Roger that.

941
01:24:41,705 --> 01:24:43,832
把他们送过去
Goffena, put them in.

942
01:24:57,721 --> 01:24:59,450
该死，该死
Motherfucker. Motherfucker.

943
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:05,733
火箭弹
RPG!

944
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:17,301
建立防线
Set up your perimeter!

945
01:25:24,496 --> 01:25:26,464
他身上有火箭弹
There's a fucking rocket in him, sir!

946
01:25:26,498 --> 01:25:30,332
冷静点，它会爆炸，快走
Othic, calm down, goddamn it! There's live ordnance, now get out!

947
01:25:32,004 --> 01:25:33,801
可恶
Son of a bitch.

948
01:25:35,007 --> 01:25:38,135
把他抬起来，小心点
All right, lift him up! Lift him up! Easy, easy!

949
01:25:38,510 --> 01:25:41,570
把他抬上车，很好
All right, get him in there! Good, good! Easy, easy!

950
01:25:43,015 --> 01:25:44,448
快上车，开车
Get in that truck and drive.

951
01:25:44,516 --> 01:25:46,450
-我受伤了 -大家都受伤了
-But I'm shot, Colonel. -Everybody's shot.

952
01:25:46,518 --> 01:25:48,577
把人犯送回去
We need the prisoners! Let's go!

953
01:25:50,022 --> 01:25:53,423
你要开到哈瓦迪街直走
Surveillance says to take Hawlwadig, then go straight.

954
01:25:53,525 --> 01:25:57,757
我要你回头开到哈瓦迪街
McKnight, we need you to turn around and head back to Hawlwadig.

955
01:25:58,030 --> 01:26:00,260
拜托，我们才从那儿来
You're shitting me! We just came through there!

956
01:26:00,532 --> 01:26:01,965
一定有更好的路线
There must be a better route!

957
01:26:02,034 --> 01:26:07,165
这是指挥中心的情报，你要调头回去
That's the info I'm getting from JOC, you need to turn around and head back.

958
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:10,531
收到了
Roger that. Roger that.

959
01:26:11,043 --> 01:26:13,876
我不敢相信，快调头
I cannot believe this shit! Turn us around, Maddox.

960
01:26:14,046 --> 01:26:15,980
他们会把我们害死
They're trying to get us fucking killed!

961
01:26:16,048 --> 01:26:17,606
快开车吧
Just get it over with! Drive!

962
01:26:18,050 --> 01:26:19,017
该死
Goddamn!

963
01:26:19,051 --> 01:26:21,349
快走吧，开车
Get us out of here, goddamn it, drive!

964
01:26:29,061 --> 01:26:30,460
快踩油门
Keep your foot on the gas!

965
01:26:30,562 --> 01:26:32,757
快踩油门
Keep your foot on the gas!

966
01:26:44,576 --> 01:26:45,600
去死
Fuck!

967
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:49,547
该死
Shit.

968
01:27:05,097 --> 01:27:07,531
舒哈和葛顿下去了
C-2, Shughart and Gordon are on the deck. Over.

969
01:27:07,599 --> 01:27:08,531
收到
Roger.

970
01:27:35,127 --> 01:27:36,617
是友军！别开枪
Friendlies!

971
01:27:38,630 --> 01:27:39,824
天啊，见到你真好
God, it's good to see you!

972
01:27:40,132 --> 01:27:42,066
你也是，你伤得多重？
It's good to see you. How bad?

973
01:27:42,134 --> 01:27:45,001
我的腿断了，我的背很痛
My leg's broken and my back feels kind of weird.

974
01:27:45,137 --> 01:27:47,196
我们要把你救出去
We've got to get you out of here.

975
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:49,937
我把他拉出来
I'm pulling him out! Cover!

976
01:27:53,145 --> 01:27:54,112
等等
Wait, l--

977
01:28:02,654 --> 01:28:03,848
我把你放下来
I'm putting you down.

978
01:28:04,156 --> 01:28:07,023
我们在坠机地点建立防线
C-2, we're at the 64 crash site, securing perimeter.

979
01:28:07,159 --> 01:28:08,683
-你还好吧？ -我还好
-You all right? -Yeah, I'm good.

980
01:28:09,161 --> 01:28:10,560
枪上膛了
You're locked and loaded.

981
01:28:10,662 --> 01:28:14,098
后面有敌人就帮我们解决掉
Any skinnies come around these corners, you watch our backs.

982
01:28:14,166 --> 01:28:16,794
-救援部队呢？ -我们就是了
-Where's the rescue squad? -We're it.

983
01:28:22,674 --> 01:28:25,734
好了，停车
All right, stop, stop, Maddox. Stop.

984
01:28:26,678 --> 01:28:28,111
可恶
Son of a bitch.

985
01:28:28,180 --> 01:28:31,013
我们又回到原点
Romeo 64, we're back where we started.

986
01:28:31,683 --> 01:28:34,117
弹药快用完了，大家都受伤
I'm low on ammo, I got many wounded including me...

987
01:28:34,186 --> 01:28:36,154
车辆几乎毁损
...vehicles that are barely running.

988
01:28:36,188 --> 01:28:39,055
好了，你就老实说吧
Okay, Danny, I need a no-b.s. assessment here.

989
01:28:39,691 --> 01:28:41,750
你能到坠机地点吗？
Can you get to the crash site?

990
01:28:42,694 --> 01:28:45,254
我什么也看不到
Colonel, I can't see shit.

991
01:28:49,201 --> 01:28:50,065
不能
Negative.

992
01:28:50,202 --> 01:28:53,137
伤兵太多，我们去也没用
With the amount of wounded we have, we'd do more harm than good.

993
01:28:53,205 --> 01:28:57,107
我们要回基地补充弹药，然后再回来
We need to come back to base, rearm and regroup and then we can go back out.

994
01:28:57,209 --> 01:28:58,176
收到
Roger.

995
01:29:00,212 --> 01:29:03,443
把他们叫回来，叫他们快走
C-2, bring them back. Get them out of there.

996
01:29:04,716 --> 01:29:06,274
收到，回基地吧
Roger. Return to base.

997
01:29:07,219 --> 01:29:08,550
我们要回去了
We're going home!

998
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:10,654
走吧，左转
Let's go. Left.

999
01:29:19,231 --> 01:29:23,133
下午4：54

1000
01:29:23,735 --> 01:29:27,000
收到了，车队要回基地
Roger that. Understand. Convoy returning to base.

1001
01:29:32,244 --> 01:29:34,303
-怎么回事？ -车队被叫回去了
-What's up? -They're sending them back.

1002
01:29:34,746 --> 01:29:36,179
车队要回基地
The convoy's headed back to base camp.

1003
01:29:36,248 --> 01:29:38,375
这太妙了
Oh, now that makes sense, don't it?

1004
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:42,743
我们要赶紧把伤兵送回去
We need to exfil the wounded now and get out of here before it's too late!

1005
01:29:43,255 --> 01:29:46,713
麦中校要回基地一定有理由
If Colonel McKnight went back to base, then he had a good reason.

1006
01:29:47,259 --> 01:29:48,692
我们的任务不变
It changes nothing.

1007
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:50,125
大伙儿听好
All right, listen up.

1008
01:29:50,262 --> 01:29:54,221
我们要守住这个据点
We're going to hold the perimeter and we're going to hold the strongpoint.

1009
01:29:54,766 --> 01:29:57,997
保留弹药，有必要才开枪
Conserve your ammo. Only shoot at what you can hit.

1010
01:30:00,272 --> 01:30:02,035
车队一定会回来
The convoy is going to come.

1011
01:30:03,275 --> 01:30:04,242
我们一定能回家
We're going to get home.

1012
01:30:16,788 --> 01:30:17,686
掩护我
Loading!

1013
01:30:26,298 --> 01:30:27,595
掩护我
Loading!

1014
01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:30,063
蓝迪，我要弹匣
Randy, I need a pistol mag!

1015
01:30:43,315 --> 01:30:44,282
掩护我
Loading!

1016
01:30:47,819 --> 01:30:49,184
最后一个弹匣
Randy, last mag!

1017
01:30:52,804 --> 01:30:53,765
葛顿
Gordy!

1018
01:30:57,803 --> 01:30:58,735
该死
Fuck!

1019
01:31:12,318 --> 01:31:14,479
葛顿死了，我出去拼了
Gordy is gone, man. I'll be outside.

1020
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:15,912
祝好运
Good luck.

1021
01:31:37,343 --> 01:31:40,176
快向第十山地师求救
We need the 10th Mountain in there. Everything they got.

1022
01:31:40,346 --> 01:31:43,440
巴基斯坦军队、马来西亚军队 我要他们的坦克车和装甲车
Pakistanis, Malays, I want their tanks and APCs.

1023
01:31:44,350 --> 01:31:45,715
他们不知道我们的行动
They don't know we've gone in.

1024
01:31:45,851 --> 01:31:50,254
我们捅出了大篓子，整个城市都在攻击我们
We have stirred up a hornet's nest here. We're fighting the entire city.

1025
01:31:50,356 --> 01:31:54,986
我要每一辆军事车辆的支援，快去找，快去
I want every vehicle possible that's got 4 wheels and armor. Get everything.

1026
01:31:55,361 --> 01:31:58,558
我要他们我们的弟兄救出敌区
Once they've assembled, we'll move our men out of the hostile area...

1027
01:31:58,864 --> 01:32:01,298
安全送到巴基斯坦军队的基地
...and back to the Pakistani Stadium, the safe zone.

1028
01:32:01,367 --> 01:32:03,835
-快去吧 -遵命，长官
-Now, let's go. -Roger that.

1029
01:32:07,373 --> 01:32:09,398
联合国军队安全区

1030
01:34:18,504 --> 01:34:20,199
穆罕默德・艾迪德
Mohamed Farrah Aidid...

1031
01:34:21,473 --> 01:34:23,031
要活捉
claims this prisoner...

1032
01:34:23,475 --> 01:34:25,102
这名战俘
...alive!

1033
01:34:40,959 --> 01:34:43,553
跪下来，快点
On your knees! Get down! Get down!

1034
01:34:47,966 --> 01:34:51,868
撑着点，你只是大腿中弹
Stay with me. You just got a bullet in the leg.

1035
01:34:56,475 --> 01:34:59,376
你看到烧轮胎的黑烟吗？
See where those tires are burning? All that black smoke?

1036
01:34:59,478 --> 01:35:02,970
我看到了，但我到不了那儿
Roger. I can see it, but I can't get there. Over.

1037
01:35:03,482 --> 01:35:06,417
坠机地点离那儿只有一百米
Go 100 meters past it. That's the crash.

1038
01:35:06,485 --> 01:35:08,544
你不明白
Negative. You don't understand.

1039
01:35:08,987 --> 01:35:13,481
前面都是路障，要找另一条路
It's roadblock after roadblock. You have to find us another route. Over.

1040
01:35:13,992 --> 01:35:17,553
另一条路要绕过整座城市
There ain't one. The only other route is all the way around the city.

1041
01:35:17,996 --> 01:35:18,928
收到
Roger that.

1042
01:35:18,997 --> 01:35:21,431
凯罗64号，这是凯罗11号
Kilo 64, this is Kilo 11.

1043
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:25,903
请准许我步行到坠机地点
Request permission to move to crash site number two on foot. Over.

1044
01:35:27,005 --> 01:35:28,939
好的，凯罗11号
Green light, Kilo 11.

1045
01:35:29,007 --> 01:35:31,373
停车，让我下去
Stop the vehicle. Let me out.

1046
01:35:58,036 --> 01:36:03,736
下午5：50

1047
01:36:16,555 --> 01:36:19,991
回去我要好好请你们喝一杯
After I'm finished with this, I'll whip you boys up some margaritas.

1048
01:36:20,058 --> 01:36:22,891
玛格丽特调酒，不加盐
The usual. Blended, no salt.

1049
01:36:30,569 --> 01:36:33,732
这是凯罗12号，我们一定要移动位置
This is Kilo 12. We've got to change our position. Over.

1050
01:36:47,586 --> 01:36:49,019
艾中士，请回答
Eversmann, come in.

1051
01:36:49,087 --> 01:36:50,145
艾中士
Eversmann.

1052
01:36:53,091 --> 01:36:55,025
-收到，你是谁？ -桑中士
-Roger who is this? -Sanderson.

1053
01:36:55,093 --> 01:36:59,462
千万别向东边开枪，我们要过去
Do not-- I say again, do not fire to the east. We are coming to you.

1054
01:37:01,099 --> 01:37:02,157
了解
Understood.

1055
01:37:02,601 --> 01:37:05,001
狄马索在东南角
DiTomasso and his men are on the southeast corner.

1056
01:37:05,103 --> 01:37:07,435
你们要占领东北角
We need you on the northeast building.

1057
01:37:07,606 --> 01:37:09,039
收到，没问题
Roger. We'll take it.

1058
01:37:09,608 --> 01:37:11,803
小心敌人，他们在屋顶
Watch out for skinnies. They're on the rooftops.

1059
01:37:12,110 --> 01:37:14,578
他们的祷告就快结束了
They're in prayer but not for much longer.

1060
01:37:17,616 --> 01:37:19,379
别向东边开火
Hold your fire to the east.

1061
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:43,301
艾中士，这是尤利
Eversmann? It's Yurek.

1062
01:37:43,642 --> 01:37:46,008
尼森和汤比跟我在一起
I got Nelson and Twombly with me.

1063
01:37:46,645 --> 01:37:49,375
我们看到直升机，你在哪里？
We got the chopper in sight. Where are you?

1064
01:37:49,648 --> 01:37:52,583
我们在西南角，你没事吧？
We're on the southwest corner. Where have you been? Are you okay?

1065
01:37:52,651 --> 01:37:53,481
没事
Yeah.

1066
01:37:55,153 --> 01:37:57,246
别开枪，我们来了
Hold your fire. We're coming in.

1067
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:03,092
我们要走了
We got to go.

1068
01:38:03,161 --> 01:38:06,028
听好，尤中士要先跑
Shawn, listen! Sergeant Yurek's going to run first.

1069
01:38:06,665 --> 01:38:10,567
等他过了马路，就会转过头掩护你
When he gets across the street, he'll turn around and cover you as you run.

1070
01:38:10,669 --> 01:38:14,765
听清楚了，你到了那儿也要掩护我
Listen closely. When you get there, you'll turn around and cover me, okay?

1071
01:38:16,174 --> 01:38:18,472
你不能直接跑去找艾中士
You won't just run to Eversmann's position.

1072
01:38:18,677 --> 01:38:21,475
你要停下来掩护我
You're going to stop and you are going to cover me.

1073
01:38:22,180 --> 01:38:24,307
你一定要搞清楚这点
It's important you understand that.

1074
01:38:24,683 --> 01:38:26,014
好了吗？
Okay, you ready?

1075
01:38:26,685 --> 01:38:28,016
好了
Yeah, I guess.

1076
01:38:33,692 --> 01:38:35,216
-别忘了 -什么？
-Don't forget. -What?

1077
01:38:36,194 --> 01:38:37,388
别忘了我
Don't forget.

1078
01:38:50,742 --> 01:38:54,075
我看到他们了，他们来了
I got them in my sight, Sarg'nt. They're coming up on the west gate.

1079
01:38:54,246 --> 01:38:55,338
我看到了
I see them.

1080
01:38:58,250 --> 01:38:59,512
出去吧
Let's move out.

1081
01:39:01,753 --> 01:39:03,448
你能掩护我们吗？
Can you cover us, Sergeant?

1082

没问题
We got you.

1083
01:39:12,764 --> 01:39:14,129
尼森
Nelson!

1084
01:39:20,772 --> 01:39:21,739
可恶
Fuck!

1085
01:39:30,282 --> 01:39:31,249
汤比
Twombly!

1086
01:39:33,285 --> 01:39:34,217
史密斯，不！
Smith! No!

1087
01:39:34,286 --> 01:39:35,514
你没事吧？
You all right?

快
Come on, man. Come on.

1091
01:39:46,798 --> 01:39:49,699
医官，快来帮史密斯
Doc! Need some help with Smith here!

1092
01:39:57,809 --> 01:39:59,071
我的腿
My leg! My leg!

1093
01:39:59,311 --> 01:40:00,972
我帮你

抬起来，1、2、3

1095
01:40:11,323 --> 01:40:13,951
-你没事了 -用力压他的伤口
-You're all right. -I need some pressure on this wound.

1096
01:40:14,326 --> 01:40:15,258
我的右腿
My right thigh!

1097
01:40:15,327 --> 01:40:16,954
用力压
Pressure, yeah.

1098
01:40:17,329 --> 01:40:19,263
-我的蛋蛋还在吧？ -还在啦
-Are my balls okay? -You still have your balls.

1099
01:40:19,331 --> 01:40:20,355
我需要帮手
I need more men in here.

1100
01:40:20,832 --> 01:40:23,266
汤比、尼森
Twombly! Nelson!

1101
01:40:23,335 --> 01:40:26,361
-压住他 -真是…
-Put him down. -Oh, man, that really....

1102
01:40:27,839 --> 01:40:30,034
-真是很痛 -直接施加压力
-lt really hurts! -Direct pressure on that.

1103
01:40:30,342 --> 01:40:31,809
没事的
It's okay, it's okay.

1104
01:40:32,344 --> 01:40:34,676
-让我看 -好了
-Let me see it! -All right.

1105
01:40:34,846 --> 01:40:37,076
让我看看
All right, let me get a look at that.

1106
01:40:37,849 --> 01:40:39,214
该死
Oh, shit!

1107
01:40:39,351 --> 01:40:40,545
该死
Oh, fuck!

1108
01:40:40,852 --> 01:40:43,218
-怎么回事？ -没事
-What the fuck was that? -It's all right.

1109
01:40:43,355 --> 01:40:45,289
按住，我要立刻送他回去
Hold that down. I need a medivac now.

1110
01:40:45,357 --> 01:40:46,722
杰利顿
Fuck. Galentine!

1111
01:40:46,858 --> 01:40:47,825
没事
It's all right.

1112
01:40:47,859 --> 01:40:49,622
杰利顿，快帮我接史上尉
Galentine! Get me Captain Steele!

1113
01:40:50,862 --> 01:40:53,831
-你还好吧？ -请回答
-Sarg'nt Ruiz, how you doing? -Juliet 64, come in. Over.

1114
01:40:53,865 --> 01:40:57,699
他们不会来接我们了
They're not going to come and get us. They're not going to come for us.

1115
01:40:57,869 --> 01:41:00,804
给我闭嘴，振作点
I need you to suck it up, Sarg'nt. I need you to focus.

1116
01:41:00,872 --> 01:41:03,238
-你办得到吗？ -请回答
-Can you do that? -Juliet 64, come in. Over.

1117
01:41:03,375 --> 01:41:05,240
你能开枪吗？
Now, can you hold your weapon?

1118
01:41:05,877 --> 01:41:06,844
能
Yes, sir.

1119
01:41:06,878 --> 01:41:10,837
谁敢闯进来就让他吃子弹
Anybody comes through that door gets two in the chest and one in the head.

1120
01:41:11,383 --> 01:41:14,784
-明白吗？ -我可以打仗
-You understand? -I'm still in the fight, sir.

1121
01:41:14,886 --> 01:41:17,787
史上尉，请派人接送伤兵
Captain Steele, I need a medivac in here now!

1122
01:41:18,390 --> 01:41:20,858
-史下士中弹 -等一下
-Corporal Smith has been hit! -Hold on, 25.

1123
01:41:20,892 --> 01:41:22,291
我可以打仗
Still in the fight.

1124
01:41:22,394 --> 01:41:23,827
他伤得很重
He's hurt pretty bad.

1125
01:41:23,895 --> 01:41:27,524
我们也有伤兵，你要留在原地
25, we got wounded too. You'll have to maintain your situation, over.

1126
01:41:27,899 --> 01:41:30,390
他再不进医院就会没命
If he doesn't get help in a half-hour, he's in trouble!

1127
01:41:31,403 --> 01:41:33,337
C-2，这是部队
C-2, this is 64.

1128
01:41:33,405 --> 01:41:37,603
第四小队需要医疗救援
Requesting a medivac for a critically wounded at Chalk Four's location. Over.

1129
01:41:37,909 --> 01:41:40,742
第四小队请求医疗救援
Command, Chalk Four is requesting medivac.

1130
01:41:40,912 --> 01:41:43,210
战况激烈，不能冒险
Can't risk it. It's still too hot.

1131
01:41:43,915 --> 01:41:48,750
我们不能派出医疗救援，撑下去
Captain, we cannot send in medivac at this time. Sit tight. Over.

1132
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:52,720
25号，这是64号， 没有医疗救援，战况太激烈
25, this is 64. Negative on the medivac. It's not possible.

1133
01:41:52,924 --> 01:41:56,655
不能再冒险派救援直升机 你们要撑下去
JOC cannot risk another bird. You'll just have to hold on.

1134
01:42:03,435 --> 01:42:04,834
让我来
All right. I got him.

1135
01:42:04,936 --> 01:42:07,336
直接压在伤口上
I want direct pressure on the wound.

1136
01:42:08,940 --> 01:42:10,703
你不会有事的
It's going to be all right.

1137
01:42:49,981 --> 01:42:52,814
这是我的直升机
I think this is mine!

1138
01:42:55,487 --> 01:42:58,581
这是凯罗11号，我到了杜伦的坠机地点
This is Kilo 11. I'm at the Durant crash site.

1139
01:42:58,990 --> 01:43:00,355
收到
Roger that.

1140
01:43:22,013 --> 01:43:23,742
第二坠机地点安全
Crash site two secured.

1141
01:43:24,015 --> 01:43:26,347
柯中校找你
Lieutenant Colonel Cribbs for you, sir.

1142
01:43:27,618 --> 01:43:28,448
柯中校？
Cribbs?

1143
01:43:28,619 --> 01:43:30,450
第十山地师基地
-They're still debating the route. -How long?

1144
01:43:30,621 --> 01:43:31,805
-他们还在讨论路线 -还要多久？
At least a couple of hours.

1145
01:43:31,823 --> 01:43:33,256
至少两个小时

1146
01:43:33,825 --> 01:43:35,452
来不及了
We haven't got that long, Joe.

1147
01:43:35,827 --> 01:43:40,321
巴基斯坦将军说我们事先没有通知他们
Pakistani General says, since we didn't deign to inform him of the raid...

1148
01:43:40,832 --> 01:43:44,268
动员第十山地师要花点时间
...it'll take some time to mobilize the 10th Mountain and 100 vehicles.

1149
01:43:44,335 --> 01:43:46,269
你告诉他
You tell the general this:

1150
01:43:46,838 --> 01:43:49,705
我了解，但是我也要提醒他
I understand, but it is my duty to remind him...

1151
01:43:49,841 --> 01:43:53,777
我的手下被武装民兵团团包围
...that my men are surrounded by thousands of armed Somali militia.

1152
01:43:53,845 --> 01:43:59,078
我们必须立刻把他们救出敌区
It's imperative that we move them out of the hostile area and into the safe zone.

1153
01:43:59,350 --> 01:44:00,840
我需要他的帮助
I need his help now.

1154
01:44:01,853 --> 01:44:03,047
是，长官
Yes, sir.

1155
01:44:08,359 --> 01:44:09,553
杜伦
Durant.

1156
01:44:10,361 --> 01:44:12,761
迈可杜伦
Michael Durant.

1157
01:44:13,364 --> 01:44:14,296
是的
Yes.

1158
01:44:14,866 --> 01:44:17,232
你是杀我同胞的游骑兵队员？
You are the Ranger who kills my people?

1159
01:44:17,869 --> 01:44:21,236
我不是，我是驾驶员
I'm not a Ranger. I'm a pilot.

1160
01:44:24,876 --> 01:44:26,138
没错
That's right.

1161
01:44:26,878 --> 01:44:29,847
美国人不抽烟了
None of you Americans smoke anymore.

1162
01:44:33,384 --> 01:44:37,980
你们都过着无趣的生活
You all live long, dull, uninteresting lives.

1163
01:44:39,891 --> 01:44:41,722
你为什么要抓我？
What do you want with me?

1164
01:44:42,393 --> 01:44:44,088
你们手上有我们的人质
You have taken hostages.

1165
01:44:44,896 --> 01:44:46,420
我们手上有你
We have you.

1166
01:44:46,898 --> 01:44:49,924
美国政府才不会跟你谈判
My government will never negotiate for me.

1167
01:44:50,401 --> 01:44:54,929
那么我就跟你谈判吧
Then perhaps you and I can negotiate, huh?

1168
01:44:56,407 --> 01:44:58,898
我们都是军人
Soldier to soldier.

1169
01:45:04,916 --> 01:45:06,679
我不是指挥官
I'm not in charge.

1170
01:45:09,921 --> 01:45:14,324
当然不是，你们能杀人却不能谈判
Course not. You have the power to kill, but not negotiate.

1171
01:45:14,926 --> 01:45:17,793
在索马利亚，杀人就是谈判
In Somalia, killing is negotiation.

1172
01:45:19,430 --> 01:45:22,763
你们真的以为抓到艾迪德将军
Do you really think if you get General Aidid...

1173
01:45:22,934 --> 01:45:26,267
我们就会放下武器
...we will simply put down our weapons...

1174
01:45:26,437 --> 01:45:29,406
接受美式民主
...and adopt American democracy?

1175
01:45:29,941 --> 01:45:31,704
或是停止杀戮吗？
That the killing will stop?

1176
01:45:32,443 --> 01:45:36,470
我只知道没有胜利就没有和平
We know this: Without victory, there can be no peace.

1177
01:45:36,948 --> 01:45:39,348
杀戮永远不会停止
There will always be killing, you see?

1178
01:45:39,951 --> 01:45:42,112
这就是我们的方法，迈可杜伦，我们不会抛弃你
This is how things are in our world.

1179
01:45:54,966 --> 01:45:58,595
迈可杜伦，我们不会抛弃你
Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind.

1180
01:46:00,972 --> 01:46:04,373
迈可杜伦，我们不会抛弃你
Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind.

1181
01:46:06,611 --> 01:46:09,444
换你来，用双手按住
You got to take over from me. Both hands.

1182
01:46:17,488 --> 01:46:20,685
伤口在股动脉，但是我看不到
It's the femoral artery, but I can't see it.

1183
01:46:20,992 --> 01:46:24,393
它一定缩进骨盆
Which means that it's retracted up into the pelvis.

1184
01:46:24,495 --> 01:46:28,727
我必须把它夹住，这样才能止血
I have to find it and clamp it. It's the only way to stop the bleeding.

1185
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,025
麻醉剂用完了
I got no more lVs.

1186
01:46:32,503 --> 01:46:35,370
所以我要你帮忙，好吗？
So, I'm going to need you to assist. Okay?

1187
01:46:35,506 --> 01:46:37,098
好
Yeah, yeah.

1188
01:46:38,009 --> 01:46:41,342
听好，我要做一件事
Now listen, Jamie. I got to do something, it's going to hurt.

1189
01:46:43,014 --> 01:46:46,450
你会很痛，不过我必须帮助你
I got to cause you more pain, but I have to do it to help you.

1190
01:46:46,517 --> 01:46:48,007
你懂吗？
All right, you understand?

1191
01:46:48,519 --> 01:46:50,487
-吗啡 -不行
-Morphine. -I can't.

1192
01:46:50,521 --> 01:46:52,955
那会降低你的心跳
lt'll lower your heart rate too far. I'm sorry.

1193
01:46:53,024 --> 01:46:55,288
汤比，抓住他的手
Twombly, why don't you take his hands?

1194
01:47:00,031 --> 01:47:02,932
把伤口撑开，压住他的大腿
Hold the wound open, keep pressure on the top of the leg.

1195
01:47:03,034 --> 01:47:05,195
尤利，帮我拿手电筒
Yurek, take the feet and a flashlight.

1196
01:47:05,536 --> 01:47:06,468
我数到三
On my count.

1197
01:47:06,537 --> 01:47:08,505
准备好了
All right, Jamie. All right.

1198
01:47:11,042 --> 01:47:13,169
一、二
One. Two.

1199
01:47:14,045 --> 01:47:15,069
三
Three.

1200
01:47:23,054 --> 01:47:25,454
等等，摸到了
Wait, wait. Okay. I feel it.

1201
01:47:26,057 --> 01:47:27,388
我摸到脉搏
I feel the pulse.

1202
01:47:29,060 --> 01:47:30,357
我找到了
I got it. I got it.

1203
01:47:30,561 --> 01:47:31,994
找到了…
I got it, yeah. I got it.

1204
01:47:32,063 --> 01:47:33,587
-找到了？ -找到了
-I got it. -You got it?

1205
01:47:34,065 --> 01:47:34,997
夹子
Clamp?

1206
01:47:37,568 --> 01:47:38,899
钳住了
I got it clamped.

1207
01:47:39,070 --> 01:47:40,002
-拿住 -好
-Hold it. -Got it.

1208
01:47:40,071 --> 01:47:41,299
这里，抓住
Here, grab it.

1209
01:47:42,073 --> 01:47:43,768
-它破了 -我抓住了
-It's tearing. -I got it.

1210
01:47:44,075 --> 01:47:45,906
-它又缩回去了 -抓住它
-Doc, it's going back in! -Hold it!

1211
01:47:46,077 --> 01:47:47,271
破了
It's tearing!

1212
01:47:47,578 --> 01:47:50,513
-出来，撑开伤口 -撑开了
-Okay. Get out. Hold the wound. -Okay, I'm holding.

1213
01:47:51,582 --> 01:47:52,844
把手拿开
Move your hand.

1214
01:48:04,595 --> 01:48:05,721
怎么了？
What?

1215
01:48:24,615 --> 01:48:25,582
治好了吗？
Fix it?

1216
01:48:29,120 --> 01:48:31,520
对，治好了
Yeah, yeah. We got it.

1217
01:48:47,138 --> 01:48:48,901
你在干什么？
What the hell are you doing?

1218
01:48:49,140 --> 01:48:53,509
关键是磨咖啡豆，不能磨得太细或太粗
It's all in the grind, Sarg'nt. Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.

1219
01:48:53,644 --> 01:48:56,272
葛姆，你都弄好了
Grimesy, you are squared away.

1220
01:49:12,663 --> 01:49:16,565
来一杯热腾腾的咖啡吧
Sarg'nt, how would you like a nice hot cup of Joe?

1221
01:49:18,669 --> 01:49:20,102
黄金海岸口味
Gold Coast blend.

1222
01:49:20,171 --> 01:49:23,072
坐下来，我看你的伤口
Sit down. I want to take a look at that foot.

1223
01:49:24,175 --> 01:49:26,234
-这不算什么 -来
-No, it's not a problem. -Come on.

1224
01:49:32,683 --> 01:49:35,743
-他们从哪儿把你找来？ -办公桌后面
-Where the hell did they find you? -Behind a desk.

1225
01:49:37,188 --> 01:49:40,180
是真的，我没开玩笑
No, really. What, you think I'm kidding?

1226
01:49:43,694 --> 01:49:45,389
-有人受伤吗？ -没有
-ls anybody hit? -We're good!

1227
01:49:51,202 --> 01:49:52,134
你们没事吧？
You all right?

1228
01:49:52,203 --> 01:49:53,135
没事
Yeah!

1229
01:49:53,204 --> 01:49:54,637
大家都没事吧？
Is everybody all right?

1230
01:49:54,705 --> 01:49:55,694
没事
Yeah!

1231
01:50:10,221 --> 01:50:11,381
火箭弹
lncoming!

1232
01:50:24,235 --> 01:50:26,135
继续开火，快点
Keep firing...faster!

1233
01:51:16,787 --> 01:51:18,755
狄马索中弹，快救他
DiTomasso's hit! Pull him out!

1234
01:51:52,323 --> 01:51:53,756
这是凯罗11号
Ranger here. This is Kilo 11.

1235
01:51:53,824 --> 01:51:57,021
我们在东南角，你是谁？
Chalk Four. We're at the southeast corner of the crash. Who's this?

1236
01:51:57,328 --> 01:51:59,228
胡特，我带了三名同胞来
This is Hoot. I'm coming with three friendlies.

1237
01:51:59,330 --> 01:52:00,922
请掩护我
I need cover fire. Over.

1238
01:52:01,332 --> 01:52:04,233
收到，凯罗11号，停火，反恐怖部队来了
Roger, Kilo 11. Hold your fire! Deltas coming in.

1239
01:52:04,335 --> 01:52:06,303
停火
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

1240
01:52:10,975 --> 01:52:15,571
地面部队要用红外线求生灯做记号
Ground personnel will have to mark target positions with infrared strobes.

1241
01:52:15,980 --> 01:52:19,711
派出攻击直升机向敌人扫射
Get little birds on strafing runs and keep them going all night long.

1242
01:52:19,984 --> 01:52:22,214
如果控制不了状况
If we don't hold back this city...

1243
01:52:22,987 --> 01:52:25,956
我们的死伤会很惨重
...we'll have a 100 caskets to fill by morning.

1244
01:52:25,990 --> 01:52:27,184
是，长官
Yes, sir.

1245
01:52:27,491 --> 01:52:30,221
第一坠机地点的地面部队
Colonel Harrell, ground personnel at crash site one...

1246
01:52:30,494 --> 01:52:34,897
要用红外线求生灯在目标上做记号
...will have to mark the target with infrared strobes to prep for air strike.

1247
01:52:34,999 --> 01:52:36,990
巴基斯坦体育场

1248
01:52:40,504 --> 01:52:41,698
麦中校
McKnight.

1249
01:52:45,509 --> 01:52:49,070
第十山地师的支援部队就够了
Between the 10th Mountain and U.N., we got enough personnel, okay?

1250
01:52:50,514 --> 01:52:53,278
你们不必再回去
Danny, you guys do not have to go back out again.

1251
01:53:06,030 --> 01:53:11,900
晚上11:23

1252
01:53:13,537 --> 01:53:16,062
我不能死在这儿
I can't die here, man.

1253
01:53:17,041 --> 01:53:21,102
你不会死的，你不会死
You're not going to die, all right? You're not going to die.

1254
01:53:22,046 --> 01:53:23,479
对不起
I'm sorry.

1255
01:53:24,048 --> 01:53:27,279
你不必道歉
You don't have anything to be sorry for.

1256
01:53:27,551 --> 01:53:30,679
你救了汤比，你干得很好
You saved Twombly. You did perfect.

1257
01:53:31,555 --> 01:53:32,988
汤比，你没事吧？
You okay, Twombs?

1258
01:53:33,557 --> 01:53:35,354
我没事
Yeah, I'm okay, Jamie.

1259
01:53:37,061 --> 01:53:39,188
你是个好军人
You did what you were trained to do.

1260
01:53:40,064 --> 01:53:41,895
你应该感到自傲
You should be proud of that.

1261
01:53:45,069 --> 01:53:46,366
你要感到骄傲
Be proud of that.

1262
01:53:47,071 --> 01:53:48,902
-小艾 -什么事？
-Ev? -Yeah.

1263
01:53:51,075 --> 01:53:52,372
帮我一个忙
Do me a favor.

1264
01:53:55,579 --> 01:54:00,482
跟我父母说我今天很英勇
You tell my parents that I fought well today.

1265
01:54:07,591 --> 01:54:09,422
我也尽了全力
And that I fought hard.

1266
01:54:11,595 --> 01:54:14,029
你要亲口跟他们说
You're going to tell them yourself, okay?

1267
01:54:14,098 --> 01:54:15,395
听到吗？
Do you hear me?

1268
01:54:17,101 --> 01:54:18,090
好吗？
All right?

1269
01:54:20,604 --> 01:54:23,698
-悍马车队来了吗？ -他们来了
-Are the humvees here? -They're coming, Jamie.

1270
01:54:24,108 --> 01:54:25,905
来了
They're coming.

1271
01:54:26,110 --> 01:54:28,340
你要撑下去
You just got to hang in there a little bit.

1272
01:54:28,612 --> 01:54:31,080
-再多撑一下子 -小意思
-You hold on for just a little bit. -I can.

1273
01:54:31,115 --> 01:54:32,241
我行的
I can.

1274
01:54:33,617 --> 01:54:35,050
没问题…
It's nothing.

1275
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:38,019
没问题
It's nothing.

1276
01:54:38,622 --> 01:54:39,714
没问题
It's nothing.

1277
01:54:40,124 --> 01:54:42,422
-没问题 -没问题
-It's nothing. -It's nothing.

1278
01:54:43,127 --> 01:54:44,253
没问题
Nothing.

1279
01:54:52,136 --> 01:54:53,068
可恶
Oh, shit.

1280
01:54:54,138 --> 01:54:55,435
压住伤口
Hold the wound.

1281
01:55:22,666 --> 01:55:23,928
医官
Doc.

1282
01:55:26,670 --> 01:55:27,659
医官
Doc.

1283
01:55:44,688 --> 01:55:45,985
没事
It's okay.

1284
01:56:12,716 --> 01:56:14,149
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

1285
01:56:17,721 --> 01:56:19,416
我们需要弹药
We need the ammo.

1286
01:56:27,731 --> 01:56:29,494
你已经尽了力
You did all you could here.

1287
01:56:29,733 --> 01:56:31,928
他们应该派直升机救援
They should've sent a medivac.

1288
01:56:32,736 --> 01:56:36,365
它一定会被击落
Right now we'd be out there defending another crashed chopper.

1289
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:39,208
更多人会受伤
More men would get torn up.

1290
01:56:42,246 --> 01:56:43,543
也许吧
Maybe.

1291
01:56:43,747 --> 01:56:46,580
别想那么多
See, you're thinking. Don't.

1292
01:56:46,750 --> 01:56:49,742
你不能决定谁受伤
Because, Sergeant, you can't control who gets hit or who doesn't.

1293
01:56:50,254 --> 01:56:52,984
或是谁从直升机上摔落
Who falls out of a chopper or why.

1294
01:56:53,257 --> 01:56:55,851
这是战争，你也无能为力
It ain't up to you. It's just war.

1295
01:56:57,761 --> 01:56:59,661
史密斯还是死了
Yeah, well, Smith's still dead.

1296
01:57:01,265 --> 01:57:05,827
-都是因为贝克朋摔下来 -你想这么多也没用
-This all happened because Blackburn fell. -Should have, could have, don't matter.

1297
01:57:06,270 --> 01:57:10,001
以后你有的是时间去想
You'll get plenty of time to think about all that later. Believe me.

1298
01:57:13,777 --> 01:57:16,871
你把弟兄们带到这儿
Sergeant, you got your men this far.

1299
01:57:17,781 --> 01:57:19,214
你已经尽了全力
You did it right today.

1300
01:57:19,283 --> 01:57:22,684
你要想该怎么把他们救出去
You need to start thinking about getting these men out of here.

1301
01:57:29,293 --> 01:57:31,124
走吧
Well, shall we?

1302
01:57:39,770 --> 01:57:42,830
我要四个人守住这角落
I need four guys in this corner now!

1303
01:57:49,279 --> 01:57:50,837
火箭弹
RPG!

1304
01:57:54,785 --> 01:57:57,253
我准备进行机关枪扫射
This is Barber 52 in position for gun run.

1305
01:57:57,287 --> 01:57:59,380
老天爷，你看看
Jesus Christ. Look at that.

1306
01:58:00,290 --> 01:58:03,225
我看到了，你就在我上方
This is 25! I can see you. You're right above me.

1307
01:58:03,293 --> 01:58:06,694
我分不出谁是敌谁是友，状况太混乱了
Eversmann, I can't tell who's who down there. Too much activity.

1308
01:58:06,797 --> 01:58:09,231
我会用红外线求生灯做记号
I'll mark the target with a strobe! Over.

1309
01:58:09,800 --> 01:58:10,892
收到
Roger that.

1310
01:58:22,813 --> 01:58:23,939
看到吗？
You see it?

1311
01:58:26,316 --> 01:58:27,874
我什么也看不到
Nah, I can't see shit.

1312
01:58:28,819 --> 01:58:31,652
-我要丢到屋顶 -你需要帮忙
-I'm putting it on the roof. -You're going to need help!

1313
01:58:31,822 --> 01:58:32,789
掩护我
Cover me.

1314
01:58:33,824 --> 01:58:37,555
我数到三就开枪掩护他
Okay, guys, we're going to lay down some cover fire for him on three!

1315
01:58:37,828 --> 01:58:38,726
好了吗？
Ready?

1316
01:58:38,829 --> 01:58:39,761
一
One.

1317
01:58:39,830 --> 01:58:40,854
二

1318
01:58:41,331 --> 01:58:42,992
三，开枪
Three. Go!

1319
01:59:15,365 --> 01:59:18,766
我看到目标了，准备进行扫射
I got your position. I got the target. We're inbound and hot.

1320
01:59:43,393 --> 01:59:47,989
C-2，弹药用完了，请求返回基地
C-2, miniguns dry. Request permission to return to base. Rearm. Over.

1321
01:59:48,398 --> 01:59:51,196
收到，第二队前往支援
Roger that. Second team inbound. Your station.

1322
01:59:51,401 --> 01:59:53,562
四分钟后抵达
On your location, four minutes.

1323
02:00:01,912 --> 02:00:04,938
车队来了，准备走了
All right, they're here. Get the wounded ready to move.

1324
02:00:05,415 --> 02:00:07,815
掩护我们
Lay down some cover fire!

1325
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:11,979
我早就听到你们了
I thought I heard a noise out here!

1326
02:00:12,422 --> 02:00:15,118
-准备好，我们要出发 -是，长官
-Load up. We're getting out of here. -Yes, sir.

1327
02:00:17,928 --> 02:00:22,627
25号，这是64号，救援车队出发了五分钟后抵达
25, this is 64. The rescue column's here and will be with you in about 5 minutes.

1328
02:00:22,933 --> 02:00:24,628
准备撤退
Prepare your men for exfil.

1329
02:00:24,935 --> 02:00:27,369
收到，收到了
Yeah, roger that, sir! Roger that!

1330
02:00:27,938 --> 02:00:31,669
救援车队五分钟后就到
Five minutes! The convoy is going to be here in five minutes!

1331
02:00:51,962 --> 02:00:54,157
我要弹匣，我用完了
I need a mag! Eversmann, I'm out!

1332
02:00:54,464 --> 02:00:55,761
最后一个
My last one!

1333
02:01:00,971 --> 02:01:04,668
清晨2:05

1334
02:01:05,976 --> 02:01:08,103
救援车队来了
The convoy is here!

1335
02:01:26,496 --> 02:01:29,954
艾中士，听说你们要搭便车
Sergeant Eversmann. I heard you guys needed a lift!

1336
02:01:30,500 --> 02:01:31,933
是的，长官
Yes, sir!

1337
02:01:32,002 --> 02:01:34,562
把伤兵抬上来
Bring your wounded and start loading them up!

1338
02:01:42,012 --> 02:01:44,105
我扶你
Hey, I got you. I got you.

1339
02:01:44,514 --> 02:01:47,210
没关系，我想用走的
It's okay. I want to walk.

1340
02:01:47,517 --> 02:01:50,543
我也一样，走吧
Yeah, I would too. Let's go!

1341
02:02:00,030 --> 02:02:01,054
出发
Move!

1342
02:02:04,034 --> 02:02:07,333
找到驾驶尸体就回体育场
We get the pilots' bodies out, and then we go to the stadium.

1343
02:02:08,038 --> 02:02:09,801
车上没有地方了
We're running out of room around here.

1344
02:02:10,040 --> 02:02:11,974
尽量挤一挤
Cram into every possible space.

1345
02:02:13,043 --> 02:02:18,003
第十山地师出动装甲车，保护我们从敌区撤退
Okay, 10th Mountain provides security for armor, walks us out of the hot zone.

1346
02:02:18,048 --> 02:02:19,515
第十山地师？
10th Mountain? No.

1347
02:02:19,549 --> 02:02:22,609
我们游骑兵的人可以殿后
Sir, with respect, my Rangers can provide rear security.

1348
02:02:23,053 --> 02:02:27,183
我们走出敌区然后再坐车
We'll walk you out of the hot zone, then we'll jump on the last few vehicles.

1349
02:02:28,058 --> 02:02:29,286
好，出发吧
Okay, let's get out of here.

1350
02:02:29,559 --> 02:02:30,719
走吧
Let's go.

1351
02:02:31,061 --> 02:02:33,461
-好了吗？ -来吧
-All right, you got him? -Yeah, come on.

1352
02:02:35,565 --> 02:02:36,896
来
Come on!

1353
02:02:38,068 --> 02:02:41,003
目标太明显了，快走吧
These things are fucking bullet magnets. Come on, let's go!

1354
02:02:41,071 --> 02:02:43,471
我要接到命令才能走
We go when I'm ordered to, soldier.

1355
02:02:46,076 --> 02:02:47,236
小心点
Careful.

1356
02:02:48,078 --> 02:02:50,239
小心
Easy. Go easy.

1357
02:02:53,583 --> 02:02:54,914
小心
Easy.

1358
02:03:05,595 --> 02:03:07,756
上校，怎么回事？
Colonel, what is going on down there?

1359
02:03:08,098 --> 02:03:11,033
他们绕着尸体拆解驾驶舱
They're dismantling the entire cockpit around the body.

1360
02:03:11,101 --> 02:03:14,730
还要多久？我要你老实说
How long is it going to take? I need an honest, no-shit assessment.

1361
02:03:16,106 --> 02:03:17,437
说不准
They can't say!

1362
02:03:19,109 --> 02:03:20,303
丹尼
Danny...

1363
02:03:22,112 --> 02:03:23,875
绝对不能抛弃同胞
...no one gets left behind.

1364
02:03:24,614 --> 02:03:26,411
你明白吗？
You understand me, son?

1365
02:03:26,616 --> 02:03:28,049
明白
Yes, General.

1366
02:03:29,119 --> 02:03:30,711
你要尽一切可能
Do what you have to do.

1367
02:03:32,122 --> 02:03:33,350
遵命
Roger.

1368
02:03:39,629 --> 02:03:41,790
-快点，把他抬出来 -好了
-Come on. Bring him through. -I got him.

1369
02:03:43,133 --> 02:03:46,261
-把伤兵救出来 -遵命
-Get all his gear. Get the wounded out. -Got you, sir!

1370
02:03:46,636 --> 02:03:50,697
10月4日，星期一，早上5：45

1371
02:03:51,641 --> 02:03:53,006
-快走 -好
-Move! -Got you!

1372
02:03:53,643 --> 02:03:55,634
快走
Move out! Move out! Let's go!

1373
02:04:05,655 --> 02:04:06,622
该死
Fuck!

1374
02:04:09,659 --> 02:04:10,921
要爆炸了
Fire in the hole!

1375
02:04:11,161 --> 02:04:12,924
-快走 -走吧
-Let's go! Move! -Let's go!

1376
02:04:23,673 --> 02:04:27,040
-快开门，我们要上去 -挤不下了，坐到车顶
-Open the hatch! We got men back here! -No room here! Go on the roof!

1377
02:04:27,177 --> 02:04:28,109
怎么回事？
What's going on?

1378
02:04:28,178 --> 02:04:31,147
-车顶？ -我才不坐车顶
-The roof? -I'm not getting on no fucking roof!

1379
02:04:32,182 --> 02:04:33,547
没地方坐了
No, no, it's full.

1380
02:04:35,185 --> 02:04:38,416
前进吧，用装甲车当掩护
We're running out. Keep moving. Use the vehicles as cover.

1381
02:04:40,690 --> 02:04:42,715
走吧
Move it! Let's go!

1382
02:04:59,709 --> 02:05:02,200
等一下
All right, hold it up. Hold it up.

1383
02:05:04,214 --> 02:05:05,545
-出发吧 -走
-Move! -Go! Move!

1384
02:05:05,715 --> 02:05:07,046
走
Go!

1385
02:06:01,771 --> 02:06:04,171
趴下来
Get down! Get down!

1386
02:06:05,275 --> 02:06:06,503
让开
Get down, lady!

1387
02:06:09,279 --> 02:06:10,610
我没子弹了
I'm out of ammo!

1388
02:06:11,781 --> 02:06:13,749
桑德森，我没子弹了
Sanderson, I'm out of ammo!

1389
02:06:18,788 --> 02:06:20,346
别拿枪
Don't you do it.

1390
02:06:21,291 --> 02:06:23,759
-你在干嘛？ -别开枪
-What are you doing? -Don't you damn do it.

1391
02:06:25,295 --> 02:06:26,592
走吧
Kurth, let's go!

1392
02:08:50,940 --> 02:08:52,407
小心点
Easy.

1393
02:09:41,991 --> 02:09:43,720
可恶
Ah, shit.

1394
02:09:43,993 --> 02:09:47,588
子弹错过你的颈静脉，别动
Bullet missed your jugular by about three millimeters. Don't move.

1395
02:09:49,499 --> 02:09:51,467
快点啦
Hurry up, hurry up.

1396
02:09:54,504 --> 02:09:58,463
咖啡没了，我替你倒了茶
Little short on coffee, but I got you some tea.

1397
02:10:03,012 --> 02:10:04,604
你还好吧？
How you doing, soldier?

1398
02:10:06,015 --> 02:10:07,846
我没有感觉
Can't feel a thing.

1399
02:10:17,527 --> 02:10:19,017
替他量脉搏
Take his pulse.

1400
02:10:52,562 --> 02:10:53,927
中士
Hey, Sarg'nt.

1401
02:10:58,568 --> 02:10:59,500
队长
Captain.

1402
02:10:59,569 --> 02:11:02,538
你还好吧？
Lorenzo. How you doing?

1403
02:11:05,575 --> 02:11:10,376
子弹穿过去，医官说我过两天就没事
It went in and out, so the medic said I should be okay in a couple of days.

1404
02:11:10,580 --> 02:11:12,241
真是好消息
That's great news.

1405
02:11:12,582 --> 02:11:14,243
我们要继续打吗？
Are we going after them?

1406
02:11:14,584 --> 02:11:17,280
当然了，我们要重新整队
You bet your ass we will. We got to regroup.

1407
02:11:18,588 --> 02:11:20,488
别把我留下来
Don't go out there without me.

1408
02:11:21,591 --> 02:11:24,992
别丢下我就回去
Don't go back out there without me.

1409
02:11:26,095 --> 02:11:27,960
我还能打仗
I can still do my job.

1410
02:11:29,599 --> 02:11:32,159
好好休息吧
You get some rest now, okay?

1411
02:11:47,617 --> 02:11:48,982
你要回去？
You're going back in?

1412
02:11:51,120 --> 02:11:52,917
战区还有弟兄
There are still men out there.

1413
02:11:55,124 --> 02:11:56,648
该死
Goddamn.

1414
02:12:02,131 --> 02:12:03,393
我每次回家
When I go home...

1415
02:12:04,133 --> 02:12:05,566
他们都问我
...and people ask me:

1416
02:12:06,135 --> 02:12:09,434
胡特，你为什么从军？
"Hey, Hoot, why do you do it, man?

1417
02:12:09,639 --> 02:12:13,439
难道你是打仗打上瘾吗？
"Why? You some kind of war junkie?"

1418
02:12:14,644 --> 02:12:17,044
我一句话也不说
I won't say a goddamn word.

1419
02:12:17,146 --> 02:12:18,340
为什么？
Why?

1420
02:12:19,148 --> 02:12:20,945
他们不会懂
They won't understand.

1421
02:12:22,652 --> 02:12:24,916
他们不懂我们干嘛打仗
They won't understand why we do it.

1422
02:12:26,656 --> 02:12:30,752
我们是为了同胞弟兄拼命
They won't understand it's about the men next to you.

1423
02:12:32,662 --> 02:12:33,924
就这么简单
And that's it.

1424
02:12:36,165 --> 02:12:37,462
很简单
That's all it is.

1425
02:12:47,677 --> 02:12:52,011
想都别想，我习惯单枪匹马
Don't even think about it, all right? I'm better on my own.

1426
02:12:57,186 --> 02:13:00,155
星期一，又是一周的开始
We started a whole new week. It's Monday.

1427
02:13:13,202 --> 02:13:15,136
贝克朋问我
I was talking to Blackburn the other day...

1428
02:13:15,204 --> 02:13:19,868
什么改变了？我们为什么要回家？
...and he asked me, "What changed? Why are we going home?"

1429
02:13:21,210 --> 02:13:23,508
我说什么都没变
And I said, "Nothing. "

1430
02:13:24,213 --> 02:13:28,115
但这不是实话，一切都变了
But that's not true, you know. I think everything's changed.

1431
02:13:29,218 --> 02:13:30,685
我也变了
I know I've changed.

1432
02:13:36,726 --> 02:13:39,160
之前有一个朋友问我
A friend of mine asked me before I got here....

1433
02:13:39,228 --> 02:13:41,423
那是在我们被派来之前
It was when we were all shipping out.

1434
02:13:41,731 --> 02:13:43,164
他问我
He asked me:

1435
02:13:44,734 --> 02:13:47,430
你为什么要去打别人的仗？
"Why are you going to fight somebody else's war?

1436
02:13:48,237 --> 02:13:50,637
你自以为是英雄吗？
"What, do y'all think you're heroes?"

1437
02:13:53,242 --> 02:13:55,608
当时我不知道该说什么
I didn't know what to say at the time...

1438
02:13:58,748 --> 02:14:01,114
现在我的答案是不
...but if he asked me again, I'd say no.

1439
02:14:03,753 --> 02:14:05,744
我不想当英雄
I'd say there's no way in hell.

1440
02:14:06,756 --> 02:14:08,747
没有人想当英雄
Nobody asks to be a hero.

1441
02:14:14,263 --> 02:14:16,493
只是有时候时势造英雄
It just sometimes turns out that way.

1442
02:14:20,269 --> 02:14:23,295
我会去找你的父母
I'll talk to your ma and pa when I get home, okay?

1443
02:15:02,812 --> 02:15:04,746
一千多名索马利亚人死亡

1444
02:15:04,814 --> 02:15:06,805
十九名美军阵亡

1445
02:15:07,316 --> 02:15:10,979
我的爱，你会坚强地活下去
My love, you are strong and you will do well in life.

1446
02:15:11,821 --> 02:15:14,255
我爱你和我的孩子
I love you and my children deeply.

1447
02:15:15,324 --> 02:15:18,725
每一天都会成长茁壮
Today and tomorrow, let each day grow and grow.

1448
02:15:19,829 --> 02:15:23,925
保持笑容，千万别被困境打倒
Keep smiling and never give up, even when things get you down.

1449
02:15:25,334 --> 02:15:27,734
最后，我的爱
So, in closing, my love...

1450
02:15:28,337 --> 02:15:32,137
今晚替我哄我的孩子入睡
...tonight, tuck my children in bed warmly.

1451
02:15:32,341 --> 02:15:36,903
跟他们说我爱他们
Tell them I love them. Then hug them for me...

1452
02:15:37,346 --> 02:15:40,144
替爸爸亲吻他们道晚安
...and give them both a kiss good night for Daddy.

1453
