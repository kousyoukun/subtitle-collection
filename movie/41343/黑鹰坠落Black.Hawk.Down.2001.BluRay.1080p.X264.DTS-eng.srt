1
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,944
There.

2
00:03:36,085 --> 00:03:38,148
Technicals, nine o'clock.

3
00:04:03,346 --> 00:04:05,248
Oh, shit! Did you see that?

4
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:09,552
Chief, we got unarmed civilians getting shot down here at nine o'clock.

5
00:04:09,552 --> 00:04:13,015
I got it, Matt. I don't think we can touch this.

6
00:04:15,391 --> 00:04:18,353
This food is the property of Mohamed Farrah Aidid!

7
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:20,692
Go back to your homes!

8
00:04:20,796 --> 00:04:22,231
Command, Super 64...

9
00:04:22,231 --> 00:04:26,262
... we got militia shooting civilians at the food distribution center.

10
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:28,371
Request permission to engage.

11
00:04:28,371 --> 00:04:31,003
Super 64, are you taking fire? Over.

12
00:04:31,274 --> 00:04:32,842
Negative, command.

13
00:04:32,842 --> 00:04:36,579
U.N.'s jurisdiction, 64. We cannot intervene.

14
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:38,540
- Return to base. Over. - Roger.

15
00:04:38,848 --> 00:04:40,877
64 returning.

16
00:05:28,464 --> 00:05:30,425
Ready, Mr. Atto.

17
00:05:41,577 --> 00:05:42,741
Leaving.

18
00:06:08,037 --> 00:06:09,304
Sir.

19
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,734
Keep Driving!

20
00:06:25,554 --> 00:06:27,845
I'm going to be late.

21
00:06:28,057 --> 00:06:30,291
Call you back.

22
00:06:47,576 --> 00:06:49,378
General Garrison?

23
00:06:49,378 --> 00:06:50,946
No, thanks. I got one.

24
00:06:50,946 --> 00:06:53,009
But these are Cuban.

25
00:06:53,049 --> 00:06:55,249
Bolivar Belicoso.

26
00:06:55,384 --> 00:06:56,673
So is this.

27
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:01,180
Miami, my friend, is not Cuba.

28
00:07:08,464 --> 00:07:11,733
I see not catching Aidid is becoming a routine.

29
00:07:12,368 --> 00:07:15,371
We weren't trying to catch Aidid. We were trying to catch you.

30
00:07:15,371 --> 00:07:16,501
Me?

31
00:07:16,772 --> 00:07:18,972
But am I that important?

32
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,810
I hardly think so.

33
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:24,046
- You're just a businessman. - Trying to make a living.

34
00:07:24,046 --> 00:07:27,076
Yeah. Selling guns to Aidid's militia.

35
00:07:31,821 --> 00:07:33,611
You've been here, what?

36
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,748
Six weeks?

37
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:41,989
Six weeks you are trying to catch the general.

38
00:07:42,198 --> 00:07:44,693
You put up reward posters.

39
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,466
$25,000. What is this? Gunfight at the K.O. Corral?

40
00:07:50,406 --> 00:07:53,698
It's the O.K. Corral.

41
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:58,280
Do you think bringing me in will make him suddenly come to you?

42
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,775
Make him more agreeable?

43
00:08:03,018 --> 00:08:05,343
You know where he sleeps.

44
00:08:05,654 --> 00:08:09,446
You pay for his beds, much less his militia.

45
00:08:10,926 --> 00:08:14,320
We're not leaving Somalia till we find him.

46
00:08:15,631 --> 00:08:16,932
And we will find him.

47
00:08:16,932 --> 00:08:19,635
Don't think because I grew up without running water...

48
00:08:19,635 --> 00:08:21,926
...I am simple, General.

49
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:25,337
I do know something about history.

50
00:08:25,608 --> 00:08:30,345
See all this? It's simply shaping tomorrow.

51
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:34,972
A tomorrow without a lot of Arkansas white boys' ideas in it.

52
00:08:35,384 --> 00:08:38,454
Well, I wouldn't know about that. I'm from Texas.

53
00:08:38,454 --> 00:08:42,884
Mr. Garrison, I think you shouldn't have come here.

54
00:08:43,192 --> 00:08:45,392
This is civil war.

55
00:08:46,061 --> 00:08:48,192
This is our war.

56
00:08:48,631 --> 00:08:50,193
Not yours.

57
00:08:51,634 --> 00:08:54,637
300,000 dead and counting.

58
00:08:54,637 --> 00:08:58,270
That's not a war, Mr. Atto. That's genocide.

59
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:02,369
Now, you enjoy that tea, you hear?

60
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,652
How'd he strike you?

61
00:09:09,652 --> 00:09:12,855
Urbane, sophisticated, cruel.

62
00:09:12,855 --> 00:09:14,918
Yeah, he's a good catch.

63
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,526
It'll take time, but Aidid will feel the loss.

64
00:09:17,526 --> 00:09:20,463
I'm not sure time is something we got in great supply.

65
00:09:20,463 --> 00:09:24,927
This isn't Iraq, you know. Much more complicated than that.

66
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:27,136
Boss, most of Washington might disagree.

67
00:09:27,136 --> 00:09:31,600
They've been calling for situation reports every morning this week.

68
00:09:32,374 --> 00:09:37,008
Well, tell them the situation is fragile.

69
00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:46,088
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Cliff "Elvis" Wolcott.

70
00:09:46,088 --> 00:09:47,790
I'll be your pilot today.

71
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:51,961
Federal regulations designate this a non-smoking Black Hawk helicopter.

72
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:56,499
Those in Mogadishu frequent flyer program will earn 100 free credits.

73
00:09:56,499 --> 00:10:01,327
And as always, the air sickness bags are in the seatback in front of you.

74
00:10:02,071 --> 00:10:05,204
Number one indications are good, Cliff. Put her on two.

75
00:10:05,207 --> 00:10:06,735
You're still clear.

76
00:10:21,657 --> 00:10:25,160
61, this is 64. Go to UHF secure.

77
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,620
I've got some bad news.

78
00:10:27,496 --> 00:10:30,499
"Limo" is a word, Durant. I don't want to hear about it.

79
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:33,369
It is not a word. It's an abbreviation of a word.

80
00:10:33,369 --> 00:10:35,504
"Limo" is a word in common usage.

81
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:39,375
That is the key phrase in Scrabble, my good friend. Common usage.

82
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:42,444
If it's not in the dictionary it doesn't count!

83
00:10:42,444 --> 00:10:44,613
It doesn't have to be in the dictionary!

84
00:10:44,613 --> 00:10:46,882
It does have to be in the dictionary!

85
00:10:46,882 --> 00:10:50,481
When we get back to the base, it's coming off.

86
00:10:51,086 --> 00:10:54,184
You touch my "limo" and I'll spank you, Nightstalker.

87
00:10:54,523 --> 00:10:56,381
Yeah, promises.

88
00:10:56,825 --> 00:10:58,888
That's a nice beach down there.

89
00:10:59,361 --> 00:11:00,650
How's the water?

90
00:11:00,863 --> 00:11:05,031
Yeah, it's nice and warm. And it's loaded with sharks.

91
00:11:10,906 --> 00:11:12,696
- Name. - Todd.

92
00:11:12,775 --> 00:11:14,838
- Last name. - Blackburn.

93
00:11:16,345 --> 00:11:18,340
First name, Todd.

94
00:11:18,347 --> 00:11:21,383
- So, what's it like? - What's what like?

95
00:11:21,383 --> 00:11:22,751
Mogadishu. The fighting.

96
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:26,919
- Serial number. - 72163427.

97
00:11:27,823 --> 00:11:31,560
Firstly, it's "the Mog" or simply "Mog." No one calls it Mogadishu here.

98
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,261
Secondly, I wouldn't know about the fighting, so don't ask.

99
00:11:35,564 --> 00:11:36,853
Why not?

100
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:38,958
Didn't I just say, "Don't ask"?

101
00:11:41,136 --> 00:11:44,940
You look like you're about 12, so let me explain something to you.

102
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,801
I have a rare and mysterious skill that precludes me from doing missions.

103
00:11:49,979 --> 00:11:51,046
Typing.

104
00:11:51,046 --> 00:11:53,746
- Can you type? - No.

105
00:11:54,783 --> 00:11:58,211
- Date of birth. - 2-27-75.

106
00:12:03,892 --> 00:12:06,057
Well, I'm here to kick some ass.

107
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:12,332
Let's bring it in.

108
00:12:27,716 --> 00:12:29,779
Nice, man! Very smooth!

109
00:12:29,918 --> 00:12:32,049
Single shot through the engine block.

110
00:12:32,421 --> 00:12:35,417
Shit, that's a shame. That was a nice jeep.

111
00:12:58,881 --> 00:13:01,479
Cease fire! Cease fire!

112
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,118
Check your weapons!

113
00:13:03,118 --> 00:13:04,407
Sergeant Eversmann.

114
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,257
Private First Class Blackburn.

115
00:13:10,292 --> 00:13:11,581
Yeah?

116
00:13:11,894 --> 00:13:13,252
Reporting for duty.

117
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:18,133
Not to me. You're reporting to It. Beales. He should be here somewhere.

118
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:19,559
Can I leave him with you?

119
00:13:20,302 --> 00:13:22,593
Yeah, go ahead.

120
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:24,871
- You brought your weapon. - Yes, sir.

121
00:13:24,907 --> 00:13:27,004
Want me to shoot? I'm rested.

122
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:30,243
- When did you get in? - Just now, Sergeant.

123
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,276
Hey, who's hungry?

124
00:13:58,507 --> 00:14:02,111
What is this, Sarg'nt? Another taxpayer-funded Delta safari?

125
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:05,403
- Not if General Garrison is asking. - I'm asking.

126
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:07,805
Have a nice meal, Captain.

127
00:14:12,354 --> 00:14:14,918
- Hey, man, there's a line. - I know.

128
00:14:15,057 --> 00:14:18,758
- Well, this isn't the back of it. - Yeah, I know.

129
00:14:19,795 --> 00:14:22,290
Sergeant. Sergeant.

130
00:14:22,698 --> 00:14:23,966
What's going on here?

131
00:14:23,966 --> 00:14:27,069
Some aerial target practice, sir. Didn't want to leave it behind.

132
00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:29,338
I'm talking about your weapon.

133
00:14:29,338 --> 00:14:32,107
Delta or no Delta, that's a hot weapon.

134
00:14:32,107 --> 00:14:35,477
You know better than that. Safety should be on at all times on base.

135
00:14:35,477 --> 00:14:38,143
Well, this is my safety, sir.

136
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:43,685
Let it go, sir. The guy hasn't eaten in a couple of days.

137
00:14:43,685 --> 00:14:46,818
You Delta boys are a bunch of undisciplined cowboys.

138
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:49,424
Let me tell you something, Sarg'nt.

139
00:14:49,424 --> 00:14:53,262
When we get on a five-yard line, you're going to need my Rangers.

140
00:14:53,262 --> 00:14:55,621
Y'all better learn to be team players.

141
00:14:57,099 --> 00:14:58,889
We're done here.

142
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,880
Speak up. You say this is your safety?

143
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,011
Well, this is my boot, son.

144
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:18,187
And it will fit up your ass with the proper amount of force.

145
00:15:18,187 --> 00:15:22,024
- Is that a Jersey accent? - I'm trying to do this, give me a break.

146
00:15:22,024 --> 00:15:24,026
Take those sunglasses off.

147
00:15:24,026 --> 00:15:26,428
Delta wants to wear Oakleys, that's their business.

148
00:15:26,428 --> 00:15:28,958
I don't want to see them on you again.

149
00:15:30,432 --> 00:15:32,427
Is that a hot weapon?

150
00:15:37,472 --> 00:15:39,007
Is that your move?

151
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,172
Is my hand on the piece?

152
00:15:41,276 --> 00:15:43,976
I can mate you in three whatever you do.

153
00:15:45,147 --> 00:15:48,746
I'd keep my eye on that queen before counseling others.

154
00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:51,352
Well, she's just lying in wait.

155
00:15:54,957 --> 00:15:56,246
Yikes.

156
00:15:58,193 --> 00:16:01,485
It's good. You're really improving.

157
00:16:01,697 --> 00:16:04,499
If I may make a suggestion... Observation.

158
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:05,734
Go ahead.

159
00:16:05,734 --> 00:16:08,366
- It's a children's book, right? - Right.

160
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:12,941
They are not supposed to scare the living shit out of the children.

161
00:16:12,941 --> 00:16:16,778
This is the part of the story where our knight is slaying the dragon.

162
00:16:16,778 --> 00:16:19,514
That's scary. Besides, my daughter loves this stuff.

163
00:16:19,514 --> 00:16:21,805
Thought you finished that last week.

164
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,712
You done?

165
00:16:24,987 --> 00:16:28,657
Hey, we are at the 10-yard line here, men.

166
00:16:28,657 --> 00:16:30,447
You understand?

167
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:33,450
Can you count? One, two, ten.

168
00:16:33,662 --> 00:16:36,031
Okay? Where are my running backs?

169
00:16:36,031 --> 00:16:38,128
Where are my running backs?

170
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:42,671
Hey, I didn't see you at church on Sunday.

171
00:16:42,671 --> 00:16:44,806
You had something more important to do?

172
00:16:44,806 --> 00:16:47,309
Not on Sunday, you don't. Not anymore.

173
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:49,907
I will make you believe, you understand?

174
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,559
Pretty funny, hoo-ah?

175
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:13,125
It was a good impression. I recognize myself.

176
00:17:15,304 --> 00:17:17,401
All right, carry on.

177
00:17:17,806 --> 00:17:20,939
- I'd like a word, specialist. - Sir.

178
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,980
You understand why we have a chain of command, don't you?

179
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,948
Roger that, sir.

180
00:17:25,948 --> 00:17:29,518
If you ever undermine me again, you'll clean latrines with your tongue...

181
00:17:29,518 --> 00:17:32,621
...till you taste no difference between shit and French fries.

182
00:17:32,621 --> 00:17:33,822
- Are we clear? - Hoo-ah, sir.

183
00:17:33,822 --> 00:17:35,054
All right.

184
00:17:42,631 --> 00:17:43,732
Listen to this:

185
00:17:43,732 --> 00:17:48,799
If one skinny kills another his clan owes the dead guy's clan a hundred camels.

186
00:17:48,837 --> 00:17:50,272
A hundred camels.

187
00:17:50,272 --> 00:17:52,802
Camels. I wouldn't pay one camel.

188
00:17:53,008 --> 00:17:55,242
Must be a lot of fucking camel debt.

189
00:17:55,777 --> 00:17:57,846
Is that really true, Lieutenant?

190
00:17:57,846 --> 00:18:00,171
Ask Sgt. Eversmann. He likes skinnies.

191
00:18:00,315 --> 00:18:03,243
Sgt. Eversmann, you really like the skinnies?

192
00:18:03,385 --> 00:18:07,289
It's not that I like them or I don't like them. I respect them.

193
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:11,753
See, what you guys fail to realize is the sergeant is a bit of an idealist.

194
00:18:12,094 --> 00:18:15,731
He believes in this mission down to his bones. Don't you, Sergeant?

195
00:18:15,731 --> 00:18:19,234
Look, these people, they have no jobs...

196
00:18:19,234 --> 00:18:23,405
...no food, no education, no future.

197
00:18:23,405 --> 00:18:27,075
I just figure that, I mean, we have two things that we can do.

198
00:18:27,075 --> 00:18:28,677
We can help...

199
00:18:28,677 --> 00:18:32,180
...or we can sit back and watch the country destroy itself on CNN.

200
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,469
Right?

201
00:18:33,515 --> 00:18:36,685
I don't know about you guys, but I was trained to fight.

202
00:18:36,685 --> 00:18:38,820
Are you trained to fight, Sergeant?

203
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,918
Well, I think I was trained to make a difference, Kurth.

204
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,457
Like the man said, he's an idealist.

205
00:18:46,928 --> 00:18:49,287
Oh, wait. This is my favorite part.

206
00:18:54,536 --> 00:18:56,638
Stay away from the cans!

207
00:18:56,638 --> 00:18:59,304
Die, gas-pumper!

208
00:18:59,674 --> 00:19:01,771
Stay away from those cans!

209
00:19:06,381 --> 00:19:08,583
No, no, stay back.

210
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,653
He's having a seizure. Put something in his mouth.

211
00:19:11,653 --> 00:19:16,890
John, it's okay. John, it's okay. It's okay.

212
00:20:02,971 --> 00:20:06,104
Well, he'll be fine. But not in this army.

213
00:20:06,808 --> 00:20:09,770
He's out of the game. He's epileptic, going home.

214
00:20:13,982 --> 00:20:16,910
I'm putting you in charge of his chalk.

215
00:20:17,052 --> 00:20:19,955
- You got a problem with that? - No, sir.

216
00:20:19,955 --> 00:20:22,124
It's a big responsibility.

217
00:20:22,124 --> 00:20:24,759
Your men will look to you to make the right decisions.

218
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:27,118
Their lives depend on it.

219
00:20:27,896 --> 00:20:29,424
All right.

220
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:32,968
- Rangers lead the way, sir. - All the way.

221
00:20:32,968 --> 00:20:34,701
Good luck.

222
00:21:17,946 --> 00:21:23,013
A meeting of Aidid's senior cabinet may take place today at 1500 hours.

223
00:21:23,552 --> 00:21:26,488
I say "may" because we all know by now...

224
00:21:26,488 --> 00:21:29,958
...with the intel we get on the street, nothing is certain.

225
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:33,091
This is actual intel confirmed by three sources.

226
00:21:33,628 --> 00:21:36,988
Two tier-one personalities may be present:

227
00:21:37,165 --> 00:21:41,269
Omar Salad, Aidid's top political advisor...

228
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:43,939
...and Abdi Hassan Awale, interior minister.

229
00:21:43,939 --> 00:21:46,230
These are the guys we're after.

230
00:21:46,808 --> 00:21:48,473
Today we go.

231
00:21:48,743 --> 00:21:51,479
Same mission template as before.

232
00:21:51,479 --> 00:21:55,784
1545, Assault Force Delta will infiltrate the target building...

233
00:21:55,784 --> 00:21:58,186
...and seize all suspects within.

234
00:21:58,186 --> 00:22:02,157
Security Force Rangers: 4 Ranger chalks, under command of Capt. Steele...

235
00:22:02,157 --> 00:22:04,559
...will rope in at 1546...

236
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,226
...and hold a four-corner perimeter around the target building.

237
00:22:08,463 --> 00:22:10,065
No one gets in or out.

238
00:22:10,065 --> 00:22:11,889
Extraction Force:

239
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:16,638
It. Colonel McKnight's humvee column will drive in at 1547...

240
00:22:16,638 --> 00:22:20,775
...on Hawlwadig Road and hold just short of the Olympic Hotel.

241
00:22:20,775 --> 00:22:22,444
Wait for the green light.

242
00:22:22,444 --> 00:22:24,546
Now once Delta gives the word...

243
00:22:24,546 --> 00:22:29,545
...McKnight's column will go to the target and load the prisoners onto trucks.

244
00:22:29,818 --> 00:22:32,387
Immediately after the prisoners are loaded...

245
00:22:32,387 --> 00:22:36,725
...the four Ranger chalks will collapse back to the target building...

246
00:22:36,725 --> 00:22:38,293
...load up on humvees...

247
00:22:38,293 --> 00:22:42,461
...and the entire ground force will exfil the 3 miles back to base.

248
00:22:42,464 --> 00:22:45,995
Mission time, no longer than 30 minutes.

249
00:22:46,801 --> 00:22:51,840
Now, I had requested light armor and AC-130 Spectre gunships...

250
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,111
...but Washington, in all its wisdom, decided against this.

251
00:22:56,111 --> 00:22:58,179
Too high-profile.

252
00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:01,583
So Black Hawks and Little Birds will provide the air cover...

253
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:04,019
...with miniguns and 2.75 rockets.

254
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:05,587
Colonel Harrell.

255
00:23:05,587 --> 00:23:10,221
In the C-2 bird, Colonel Matthews will coordinate the air mission...

256
00:23:10,425 --> 00:23:13,558
...and I will coordinate ground forces.

257
00:23:13,595 --> 00:23:14,963
Colonel Matthews.

258
00:23:14,963 --> 00:23:18,562
Mission launch code word is Irene.

259
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:20,022
Questions?

260
00:23:22,971 --> 00:23:24,602
Which building is it, sir?

261
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:28,734
We're confirming that now. Somewhere near the Bakara market.

262
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:34,249
I don't choose the time or place of their meetings.

263
00:23:34,249 --> 00:23:36,346
I didn't say a word, sir.

264
00:23:36,351 --> 00:23:39,821
Make no mistake, once you're in the Bakara market...

265
00:23:39,821 --> 00:23:42,521
...you're in an entirely hostile district.

266
00:23:42,757 --> 00:23:45,360
Don't underestimate their capabilities.

267
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,097
We'll be in friendly neighborhoods before we hit the market...

268
00:23:49,097 --> 00:23:53,968
...so remember the rules of engagement: No one fires unless fired upon.

269
00:23:53,968 --> 00:23:56,532
Now, let's go get this thing done.

270
00:23:57,339 --> 00:23:59,266
Good luck, gentlemen.

271
00:24:03,912 --> 00:24:07,048
What's the matter, Danny? Something you don't like?

272
00:24:07,048 --> 00:24:09,417
No Spectre gunships, daylight instead of night...

273
00:24:09,417 --> 00:24:12,087
...afternoon when they're all fucked up on khat...

274
00:24:12,087 --> 00:24:16,551
...only part of the city Aidid can mount a counter-attack on short notice...

275
00:24:16,624 --> 00:24:19,728
- What's not to like? - Life's imperfect.

276
00:24:19,728 --> 00:24:23,698
For you two, circling above it at 500 feet, it's imperfect.

277
00:24:23,698 --> 00:24:27,661
Down in the street, it's unforgiving.

278
00:25:03,538 --> 00:25:05,135
What the fuck, Smith?

279
00:25:05,807 --> 00:25:07,876
- Well? - Well, what?

280
00:25:07,876 --> 00:25:09,643
We going?

281
00:25:10,712 --> 00:25:14,778
- Why should I tell you that? - Because I'm me.

282
00:25:15,817 --> 00:25:19,721
Yeah. 3:00. Downtown.

283
00:25:19,721 --> 00:25:21,489
- Bakara market. - All right.

284
00:25:21,489 --> 00:25:25,527
Listen, Smith, I need you to back me up out there today, all right?

285
00:25:25,527 --> 00:25:27,021
Keep sharp.

286
00:25:29,397 --> 00:25:31,733
Yes, sir, Sergeant Eversmann.

287
00:25:31,733 --> 00:25:34,399
Ev, it's going to be nothing, man.

288
00:25:34,736 --> 00:25:36,333
Nothing.

289
00:25:38,907 --> 00:25:44,543
It's all in the grind, Sizemore. Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.

290
00:25:44,846 --> 00:25:47,341
This, my friend, is a science.

291
00:25:47,916 --> 00:25:50,952
You're looking at the guy that believed the commercials.

292
00:25:50,952 --> 00:25:53,288
About "be all you can be."

293
00:25:53,288 --> 00:25:56,386
I made coffee through Desert Storm.

294
00:25:56,391 --> 00:25:59,794
I made coffee through Panama, while everyone else got to fight...

295
00:25:59,794 --> 00:26:01,925
...got to be a Ranger.

296
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:07,465
Now it's "Grimesy, black, one sugar" or "Grimesy, got a powdered anywhere?"

297
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,830
- What happened to you? - Ping-Pong accident.

298
00:26:13,908 --> 00:26:15,197
What?

299
00:26:15,877 --> 00:26:17,542
So guess what.

300
00:26:17,846 --> 00:26:20,849
Your wish has been granted. You're going out today.

301
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:22,717
You're fucking me.

302
00:26:22,717 --> 00:26:25,386
You're taking my place assisting the 60 gunner.

303
00:26:25,386 --> 00:26:28,849
Sergeant Eversmann said to get your stuff and get ready.

304
00:26:29,724 --> 00:26:31,860
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

305
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,491
Oh, yeah.

306
00:26:34,996 --> 00:26:36,264
Hell, yeah.

307
00:26:36,264 --> 00:26:40,001
Grimesy, stick with Waddell and give him ammo when he needs it.

308
00:26:40,001 --> 00:26:41,402
- Hoo-ah? - Hoo-ah.

309
00:26:41,402 --> 00:26:46,107
I wouldn't worry about that. Generally speaking, Somalis can't shoot for shit.

310
00:26:46,107 --> 00:26:50,245
Just watch out for the sammys throwing the rocks, and you'll be fine.

311
00:26:50,245 --> 00:26:51,446
Might even be fun.

312
00:26:51,446 --> 00:26:55,416
D-boys do their thing now. All we got to do is cover them.

313
00:26:55,416 --> 00:26:58,617
Choppers going to cover us, and we'll be all right.

314
00:26:59,187 --> 00:27:03,291
Look, you guys, this is my first time as chalk leader...

315
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:06,861
...but, this isn't our first time out together. This is serious.

316
00:27:06,861 --> 00:27:10,597
We're Rangers, not some sorry-ass JROTC.

317
00:27:10,865 --> 00:27:12,427
We're elite.

318
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:15,261
Let's act like it out there. Hoo-ah?

319
00:27:16,104 --> 00:27:18,099
Any questions?

320
00:27:24,212 --> 00:27:26,173
We're going to be okay.

321
00:27:26,714 --> 00:27:28,845
Grab your gear. Let's move out.

322
00:27:48,903 --> 00:27:53,196
You're not going to need that, dude. We're not out there long enough.

323
00:28:00,882 --> 00:28:02,581
You won't need that, either.

324
00:28:02,817 --> 00:28:04,953
We'll be back before dark.

325
00:28:04,953 --> 00:28:07,689
You might as well take dope and beer instead.

326
00:28:07,689 --> 00:28:09,190
What?

327
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,424
Ammo, dude. Take ammo.

328
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:22,236
Let me tell you something, Grimes. You got 50 pounds of gear.

329
00:28:22,236 --> 00:28:23,471
You don't need another 12.

330
00:28:23,471 --> 00:28:27,976
I don't know about you, I don't plan on getting shot running away.

331
00:28:27,976 --> 00:28:29,711
Well, I better keep mine in.

332
00:28:29,711 --> 00:28:30,812
Grimes.

333
00:28:30,812 --> 00:28:32,981
Most important thing:

334
00:28:32,981 --> 00:28:36,546
Remember, when everyone is shooting, shoot in the same direction.

335
00:28:44,525 --> 00:28:48,396
Look at this. He's taping his blood type to his boots.

336
00:28:48,396 --> 00:28:52,223
- That's bad luck. - No, it's smart.

337
00:28:52,233 --> 00:28:54,330
All Delta do that.

338
00:28:54,836 --> 00:28:57,127
That's bad luck too, man.

339
00:28:57,338 --> 00:28:58,764
Come on, let's go.

340
00:29:02,043 --> 00:29:05,176
It's a good thing you're right-handed, Adonis.

341
00:29:07,015 --> 00:29:11,513
- If not, I don't know what you'd do. - You're a funny guy, man.

342
00:29:12,854 --> 00:29:15,952
- I'm not taking no death letter. - We have a deal.

343
00:29:18,459 --> 00:29:20,695
I'll give it to you back in an hour.

344
00:29:20,695 --> 00:29:25,193
- Blackburn, you okay? - Excited.

345
00:29:26,367 --> 00:29:30,159
In a good way. I've been training my whole life for this.

346
00:29:30,238 --> 00:29:32,563
You ever shot at anybody before?

347
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,129
No, sir.

348
00:29:35,443 --> 00:29:36,971
Me neither.

349
00:30:10,912 --> 00:30:12,447
Think he's reliable?

350
00:30:12,447 --> 00:30:16,217
Well, we'll see. It's his first time out.

351
00:30:24,058 --> 00:30:26,594
- Tell him to turn his damn radio off. - Yes, sir.

352
00:30:26,594 --> 00:30:28,496
Tell him to turn his radio off.

353
00:30:28,496 --> 00:30:31,788
Abdi, you need to turn your radio off.

354
00:30:37,805 --> 00:30:42,769
Hi. You've reached Stephanie and Randy, leave us a message. Thank you.

355
00:30:44,812 --> 00:30:47,546
Hey, baby, it's me. Are you there?

356
00:30:48,816 --> 00:30:51,107
Pick up if you're there.

357
00:30:51,686 --> 00:30:54,955
I'm just calling to make sure everything's all right.

358
00:30:55,256 --> 00:30:57,990
I'll call you in a couple hours.

359
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,960
You'd better not be sleeping.

360
00:31:01,662 --> 00:31:03,259
Your move, Randy.

361
00:31:04,699 --> 00:31:06,523
I'm missing you.

362
00:31:07,268 --> 00:31:09,331
I love you, baby.

363
00:31:10,471 --> 00:31:12,102
Hello? Hello?

364
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:15,569
Thanks, bud.

365
00:31:17,645 --> 00:31:19,845
You know, it's kind of funny.

366
00:31:20,148 --> 00:31:23,576
Beautiful beach, beautiful sun.

367
00:31:24,619 --> 00:31:27,054
Could almost be a good place to visit.

368
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:28,753
Almost.

369
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:34,486
You don't think we should be here.

370
00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:39,889
You know what I think? It don't really matter what I think.

371
00:31:40,935 --> 00:31:45,473
Once that first bullet goes past your head, politics and all that shit...

372
00:31:45,473 --> 00:31:47,900
...just goes right out the window.

373
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:50,703
I just want to do it right today.

374
00:31:51,045 --> 00:31:55,179
Just watch your corner. Get all your men back here alive.

375
00:32:20,107 --> 00:32:24,145
Now, is this supposed to be the place, or did his car just take a dump?

376
00:32:24,145 --> 00:32:25,878
Abdi, come in.

377
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,848
Abdi, can you hear me? Is this the place?

378
00:32:32,887 --> 00:32:34,381
Abdi, come in.

379
00:32:39,393 --> 00:32:42,287
Can you hear me? Abdi.

380
00:32:42,763 --> 00:32:45,967
Abdi, come in. Is this the place?

381
00:32:45,967 --> 00:32:48,735
To my right side, above the cafe.

382
00:32:48,803 --> 00:32:51,305
He says this is the building.

383
00:32:51,305 --> 00:32:53,038
He's certain?

384
00:32:53,341 --> 00:32:55,409
Abdi, you need to be sure.

385
00:32:55,409 --> 00:32:57,074
Are you sure?

386
00:32:58,446 --> 00:33:03,080
Well, it's down the road, two blocks over on my left.

387
00:33:03,718 --> 00:33:05,918
But there's too many militia.

388
00:33:06,187 --> 00:33:08,819
If I go closer, they might shoot me.

389
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:12,226
Now he's saying the building's a couple blocks down...

390
00:33:12,226 --> 00:33:14,892
...but if he's seen outside it, he'll be shot.

391
00:33:15,396 --> 00:33:17,765
I'll fucking shoot him myself.

392
00:33:17,765 --> 00:33:21,369
Tell him I want his skinny ass parked in front of the building.

393
00:33:21,369 --> 00:33:24,739
He's not getting paid till he does exactly that.

394
00:33:24,739 --> 00:33:28,009
Three miles to the target. We're never off the main roads.

395
00:33:28,009 --> 00:33:31,279
At K-four traffic circle, we turn north, then east on National...

396
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:34,548
...and we wait until extraction of prisoners is complete here.

397
00:33:34,548 --> 00:33:36,584
Then we roll up in force on Hawlwadig...

398
00:33:36,584 --> 00:33:40,411
...load the prisoners, the assault-blocking forces and bring them back.

399
00:33:40,855 --> 00:33:43,224
Home in an hour. Okay?

400
00:33:43,224 --> 00:33:46,594
There will be some shooting. Bakara market is the Wild West.

401
00:33:46,594 --> 00:33:50,159
But be careful what you shoot at. People do live there.

402
00:33:50,464 --> 00:33:52,026
Hoo-ah.

403
00:34:03,678 --> 00:34:08,176
Last one of these guys shot himself in the head playing Russian roulette.

404
00:34:21,562 --> 00:34:24,160
Sir, the vehicle is stopped.

405
00:34:24,665 --> 00:34:28,366
So this is the real deal now. He's sure this time.

406
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:33,466
- He sounds scared shitless. - Good. That's always a good sign.

407
00:34:44,585 --> 00:34:46,921
That's it. That's our signal.

408
00:34:46,921 --> 00:34:48,552
All right.

409
00:34:48,756 --> 00:34:51,820
All QRF out of the airspace.

410
00:34:52,927 --> 00:34:55,354
All QRF out of the airspace.

411
00:34:59,934 --> 00:35:04,694
All units, Irene. I say again, Irene.

412
00:35:11,946 --> 00:35:16,784
Check in when ready. Barber 51 up and ready. Star 41 up and ready.

413
00:35:16,784 --> 00:35:18,278
Irene!

414
00:35:18,652 --> 00:35:20,419
Copy, Irene.

415
00:35:20,988 --> 00:35:22,585
Fucking Irene!

416
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,300
Come on.

417
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,979
Good luck, boys.

418
00:35:44,979 --> 00:35:46,712
Be careful.

419
00:35:46,814 --> 00:35:49,207
No one gets left behind.

420
00:35:50,818 --> 00:35:52,449
What's wrong?

421
00:35:52,987 --> 00:35:56,450
Nothing. He's just never done that before.

422
00:35:57,158 --> 00:35:58,925
Aw, fuck!

423
00:36:02,763 --> 00:36:04,223
Let's go.

424
00:36:04,932 --> 00:36:07,996
Sergeant Struecker. Let's roll.

425
00:38:46,894 --> 00:38:48,525
Two minutes.

426
00:38:49,396 --> 00:38:51,129
Two minutes.

427
00:39:35,976 --> 00:39:38,870
Why are they burning tires?

428
00:39:38,879 --> 00:39:42,012
Signals to the militia that we're coming!

429
00:39:43,884 --> 00:39:47,354
Okay, 56, looks like there's some friendlies on the ground.

430
00:39:47,354 --> 00:39:50,646
Looks like I've got a tally on the voice.

431
00:39:56,864 --> 00:39:58,461
One minute.

432
00:39:59,533 --> 00:40:01,061
One minute.

433
00:40:05,172 --> 00:40:06,803
What's that for?

434
00:40:07,808 --> 00:40:11,077
Last rope, I almost bit my tongue off.

435
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:43,974
Touching base.

436
00:40:47,514 --> 00:40:49,441
Two feet, one foot...

437
00:40:50,918 --> 00:40:52,549
... clear.

438
00:40:53,354 --> 00:40:56,646
Little birds touching down at target.

439
00:41:40,934 --> 00:41:42,292
Ropes!

440
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:46,061
Go! Go! Go!

441
00:41:52,813 --> 00:41:56,650
Chalk One troops are on the deck. Chalk Two deployed.

442
00:41:56,650 --> 00:42:00,283
This is McKnight. Uniform 64 approaching staging area.

443
00:42:11,732 --> 00:42:13,534
Down! Get down!

444
00:42:13,534 --> 00:42:15,469
Down! Stay down!

445
00:42:15,469 --> 00:42:17,271
Get down! Everybody down!

446
00:42:17,271 --> 00:42:18,906
You, down!

447
00:42:18,906 --> 00:42:20,007
Get down!

448
00:42:20,007 --> 00:42:21,331
On the floor.

449
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:29,114
Let's go, let's go!

450
00:42:30,217 --> 00:42:32,820
Grimesy! No fear!

451
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,951
Oh, yeah, right!

452
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:41,525
Rangers securing perimeter. Four corners.

453
00:42:41,562 --> 00:42:44,456
Colonel, they're shooting at us!

454
00:42:44,832 --> 00:42:46,900
Colonel, they're shooting at us!

455
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,531
Well, shoot back!

456
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:55,209
This is 64. Chalks on the ground, going into holding pattern.

457
00:42:55,209 --> 00:42:58,078
This is 62, delivered chalks. Going to cover pattern.

458
00:42:58,078 --> 00:43:02,349
Super 62, take up an overhead pattern to provide sniper cover. Over.

459
00:43:02,349 --> 00:43:06,050
This is Super 65. Chalks on the ground, going into holding pattern.

460
00:43:11,925 --> 00:43:15,353
Go, Blackburn, go! Go!

461
00:43:15,395 --> 00:43:16,957
Go, Blackburn!

462
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:20,567
RPG!

463
00:43:20,567 --> 00:43:22,334
Hold on!

464
00:43:25,005 --> 00:43:26,499
No!

465
00:43:36,683 --> 00:43:39,008
C- 2, we got a man fallen.

466
00:43:39,319 --> 00:43:42,110
Super-61, you're a sitting duck.

467
00:43:42,222 --> 00:43:45,659
Take up overhead pattern to provide sniper cover. Over.

468
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:48,223
Roger that. 61 coming out.

469
00:43:49,162 --> 00:43:53,734
13, go ahead. I need you to move to the north of the street.

470
00:43:53,734 --> 00:43:56,628
Right to the north. Right there. Over.

471
00:43:57,638 --> 00:43:59,701
Doc! Doc Schmid!

472
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:01,408
Come on!

473
00:44:01,408 --> 00:44:04,233
Schmid, we got a man hit.

474
00:44:05,913 --> 00:44:08,916
- Where's he hit? - He's not. He fell.

475
00:44:08,916 --> 00:44:11,184
- What? - He fell.

476
00:44:14,121 --> 00:44:16,123
Why aren't you shooting?

477
00:44:16,123 --> 00:44:18,191
We're not being shot at yet!

478
00:44:18,191 --> 00:44:19,760
How can you tell?

479
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,428
A hiss means it's close.

480
00:44:21,428 --> 00:44:23,096
A snap means...

481
00:44:23,096 --> 00:44:25,193
Now they're shooting at us!

482
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,168
Galentine!

483
00:44:38,712 --> 00:44:41,606
Get me Captain Steele! Get me Captain Steele!

484
00:44:41,715 --> 00:44:45,152
Juliet 64, this is Juliet 25. Come in. Over.

485
00:44:45,152 --> 00:44:47,187
Blackburn, can you hear me?

486
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:50,615
Juliet 64, this is 25. Come in. Over.

487
00:44:50,624 --> 00:44:52,357
I can't get him!

488
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:56,663
Juliet 64, this is Chalk Four! We've got a man down!

489
00:44:56,663 --> 00:44:58,732
We need to get him out of here! Over.

490
00:44:58,732 --> 00:45:02,126
This is 64. Say again, 25. Over.

491
00:45:02,603 --> 00:45:05,394
We've got a man down! Over.

492
00:45:06,673 --> 00:45:10,170
Take a breath, 25, and calm down. Over.

493
00:45:10,344 --> 00:45:13,113
- Man down! - Missed that, 25.

494
00:45:13,113 --> 00:45:15,015
- Fuck it. - Say again.

495
00:45:15,015 --> 00:45:17,317
Matt, it's a long way to the humvees!

496
00:45:17,317 --> 00:45:20,954
We'll get a stretcher in here. Get him to the target building.

497
00:45:20,954 --> 00:45:22,522
What did he say?

498
00:45:22,522 --> 00:45:26,656
Super 61, we got a man wounded on the ground.

499
00:45:27,194 --> 00:45:30,364
- Stretcher! - Get me a stretcher!

500
00:45:30,364 --> 00:45:32,366
Come on. Stretcher.

501
00:45:32,366 --> 00:45:34,031
Come on, come on!

502
00:45:34,635 --> 00:45:36,493
Grab this end!

503
00:45:37,571 --> 00:45:39,498
Let's go!

504
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,308
- All right. - Go.

505
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:44,845
Get him to the humvees. We'll hold down the corner.

506
00:45:44,845 --> 00:45:46,942
Up to the humvees! Now!

507
00:45:50,217 --> 00:45:52,678
Go! Go!

508
00:45:54,254 --> 00:45:56,681
Keep moving, Grimes! Run!

509
00:46:01,228 --> 00:46:02,996
- Secure! - Let's move out!

510
00:46:02,996 --> 00:46:05,432
Everybody up! Let's go!

511
00:46:05,432 --> 00:46:06,833
Come on!

512
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:08,794
Let's go! Let's move!

513
00:46:11,672 --> 00:46:14,497
- Grimes, run! - All right.

514
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:21,181
C- 2, this is Super 61, beginning my orbit of the target area.

515
00:46:21,181 --> 00:46:24,746
Chalk Four, clear for a clear. Coming in.

516
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:30,023
Kilo 11, this is 61, providing cover for prisoner extract. Over.

517
00:46:30,023 --> 00:46:32,018
Kilo 64, green light.

518
00:46:32,059 --> 00:46:35,529
- Ready for extraction. Over. - Roger that. Will relay.

519
00:46:35,529 --> 00:46:38,161
That's it. We got them.

520
00:46:38,532 --> 00:46:41,733
Uniform 64, ready for extraction. Over.

521
00:46:41,835 --> 00:46:44,671
Roger that. There's the call. Let's move out!

522
00:46:44,671 --> 00:46:46,802
- Let's move out! - Hold on.

523
00:47:08,628 --> 00:47:11,298
- How much longer? - Five minutes, sir.

524
00:47:11,298 --> 00:47:12,966
- What? - Five minutes.

525
00:47:12,966 --> 00:47:14,893
Nothing takes five minutes!

526
00:47:20,107 --> 00:47:21,608
What happened to him?

527
00:47:21,608 --> 00:47:25,241
- He fell! Missed the rope! - How'd he do that?

528
00:47:25,779 --> 00:47:29,242
Put him in that humvee! Grimes, give him a hand!

529
00:47:29,382 --> 00:47:31,451
Let's go! Let's move it!

530
00:47:31,451 --> 00:47:33,912
Move, move! Come on! Move!

531
00:47:35,789 --> 00:47:37,224
Get him in there!

532
00:47:37,224 --> 00:47:39,014
Get ready to move!

533
00:47:39,292 --> 00:47:41,583
Go! Everybody move! Move!

534
00:47:42,162 --> 00:47:44,225
Get the fuck up!

535
00:47:44,464 --> 00:47:46,789
Grimes! Come on!

536
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,361
Grimes! Grimes!

537
00:47:57,032 --> 00:47:59,095
Fuck this!

538
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:23,450
Fuck!

539
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,358
Let's go.

540
00:48:30,665 --> 00:48:32,159
Come on!

541
00:48:32,667 --> 00:48:34,336
Go! Move it!

542
00:48:34,336 --> 00:48:35,503
Move!

543
00:48:35,503 --> 00:48:38,773
Romeo 64, I need to send out three humvees with a casualty.

544
00:48:38,773 --> 00:48:41,009
He looks real bad. I need to evac now.

545
00:48:41,009 --> 00:48:42,611
Roger that, Uniform 64.

546
00:48:42,611 --> 00:48:45,213
We'll chop a team of gun ships to you. Over.

547
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,071
Roger that.

548
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:49,517
I need extra security on these humvees!

549
00:48:49,517 --> 00:48:52,687
I'll go. I'll take my team, make sure they get back okay.

550
00:48:52,687 --> 00:48:53,955
Do it.

551
00:48:53,955 --> 00:48:56,314
Struecker, you're lead humvee.

552
00:49:01,062 --> 00:49:04,593
First three vehicles mount up, we're moving back to base.

553
00:49:05,634 --> 00:49:07,196
Move out!

554
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:26,821
How are things going? Things okay there, Struecker?

555
00:49:26,821 --> 00:49:29,157
I don't want to talk about it now, Colonel!

556
00:49:29,157 --> 00:49:30,822
I'm busy.

557
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,012
Sergeant Pilla's hit!

558
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,858
Christ, he's fucked up!

559
00:50:03,858 --> 00:50:05,523
Is anyone hit?

560
00:50:05,694 --> 00:50:07,195
Struecker, talk to me!

561
00:50:07,195 --> 00:50:09,190
It's Sergeant Pilla!

562
00:50:09,364 --> 00:50:11,188
What's his status?

563
00:50:11,866 --> 00:50:13,565
What's his status?

564
00:50:13,902 --> 00:50:15,499
He's dead.

565
00:50:16,237 --> 00:50:17,706
He's dead.

566
00:50:17,706 --> 00:50:19,496
Pilla's dead, sir.

567
00:50:21,543 --> 00:50:26,780
C- 2, this is McKnight. We have a KIA Dominick Pilla. Over.

568
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,772
Roger that.

569
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:31,386
Get on that 50!

570
00:50:31,386 --> 00:50:33,822
Someone get on that 50!

571
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,521
It's mine.

572
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:25,101
Three guys with RPGs, coming up on your side now!

573
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,712
Stay with it!

574
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:37,378
This is 61. I'm hit. I'm hit.

575
00:51:37,752 --> 00:51:42,352
Super 61 is hit. He is hit. Wolcott's bird is hit.

576
00:51:44,325 --> 00:51:47,095
You want to pull those PCLs off-line or what?

577
00:51:47,095 --> 00:51:48,692
Right, babe.

578
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:50,686
Come on.

579
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:58,907
61, going down.

580
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,241
61 going down.

581
00:52:00,241 --> 00:52:02,975
61 is going down.

582
00:52:04,112 --> 00:52:06,744
Super 61 is going down.

583
00:52:06,981 --> 00:52:09,184
Super 61 is going down.

584
00:52:09,184 --> 00:52:12,187
61 is going down. I repeat, it's going down.

585
00:52:12,187 --> 00:52:14,284
61's going down.

586
00:52:16,357 --> 00:52:18,181
Hold on!

587
00:52:40,515 --> 00:52:43,682
We got a Black Hawk down. We got a Black Hawk down.

588
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:48,089
Super 61 is down. We got a bird down in the city.

589
00:52:48,089 --> 00:52:50,357
Super 61 is on the deck now.

590
00:52:51,059 --> 00:52:53,895
Get an MH-six on site. Check for survivors.

591
00:52:53,895 --> 00:52:55,930
Send in the SAR bird.

592
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:59,767
I want ground forces to move and secure a new perimeter around that crash site.

593
00:52:59,767 --> 00:53:01,903
Can you guide the convoy in there?

594
00:53:01,903 --> 00:53:03,104
Roger that.

595
00:53:03,104 --> 00:53:04,735
Well, move quick.

596
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:08,308
The whole city will be coming down on top of them.

597
00:53:08,843 --> 00:53:12,881
Star 41, come inbound and see if you can land at the crash site.

598
00:53:12,881 --> 00:53:15,513
Roger that. Star 41 inbound.

599
00:53:27,228 --> 00:53:29,325
We just lost the initiative.

600
00:53:35,803 --> 00:53:37,536
25, this is 64. Over.

601
00:53:37,872 --> 00:53:39,537
25. Over.

602
00:53:39,874 --> 00:53:43,378
25, Chalk Four is closest to the crash site. Over.

603
00:53:43,378 --> 00:53:46,169
64, I can't see the crash site. Over.

604
00:53:46,714 --> 00:53:49,551
25, it's due east of you. You will find it.

605
00:53:49,551 --> 00:53:53,421
Leave a security element in place. Take the rest of your chalk to the crash.

606
00:53:53,421 --> 00:53:57,088
Check for survivors. Secure the area. All other chalks will follow.

607
00:53:59,394 --> 00:54:01,787
25, do you read me? Over.

608
00:54:02,163 --> 00:54:04,666
Galentine! Schmid!

609
00:54:04,666 --> 00:54:06,000
Get Yurek.

610
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,535
Get Twombly.

611
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:10,004
Hey, there's a Black Hawk down.

612
00:54:10,004 --> 00:54:11,940
Twombly, Nelson, stay here.

613
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:15,043
Hold this corner and then exfil with the humvees.

614
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:19,177
Galentine, Schmid, you're coming with me. Let's go.

615
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,616
How come I got to stay back here?

616
00:54:21,616 --> 00:54:23,645
Because you're dependable.

617
00:54:24,519 --> 00:54:26,081
All right...

618
00:54:27,488 --> 00:54:29,119
...let's go!

619
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:36,262
I hate being dependable, man.

620
00:54:50,411 --> 00:54:54,048
Juliet 25, hostiles advancing, parallel west to your position.

621
00:54:54,048 --> 00:54:56,417
Women and children among them. Over.

622
00:54:56,417 --> 00:54:57,945
Hit the wall.

623
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:15,968
Incoming!

624
00:55:21,342 --> 00:55:23,075
Grenade!

625
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:40,354
Go.

626
00:55:50,772 --> 00:55:53,107
We still got guys inside!

627
00:55:53,107 --> 00:55:54,909
I'll go to the crash.

628
00:55:54,909 --> 00:55:58,880
You take the rest of the team. I'll finish loading the prisoners.

629
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,282
No! We'll go to the crash site together.

630
00:56:01,282 --> 00:56:03,584
Secure the perimeter, wait for the humvees.

631
00:56:03,584 --> 00:56:05,715
- Roger that. - Follow my lead.

632
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:08,156
Sarg'nt, are you receiving me?

633
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:11,118
Yeah, I heard you. We should be leaving soon.

634
00:56:12,694 --> 00:56:15,563
All right, we need to move out now!

635
00:56:15,563 --> 00:56:18,866
I'll finish loading the prisoners and pick you up at the crash site!

636
00:56:18,866 --> 00:56:20,168
Let's move out!

637
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,867
Moving out! Go!

638
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:30,878
Get in! Get in!

639
00:56:30,878 --> 00:56:32,440
Move!

640
00:56:45,593 --> 00:56:47,417
Eight o'clock!

641
00:57:01,109 --> 00:57:03,707
Grimes, stay away from the walls.

642
00:57:18,326 --> 00:57:20,958
Grimes. You okay?

643
00:57:20,995 --> 00:57:22,557
Yeah!

644
00:57:24,332 --> 00:57:25,997
Let's go, Maddox.

645
00:57:26,167 --> 00:57:28,669
- C-2, convoy's moving out. - Roger that.

646
00:57:28,669 --> 00:57:31,539
Maddox, look at these jerks! These idiots!

647
00:57:31,539 --> 00:57:34,399
Go, go! Right, Maddox, right!

648
00:57:43,684 --> 00:57:46,475
Twombly, the convoy is leaving!

649
00:57:46,554 --> 00:57:48,651
Hey, Twombly!

650
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:50,391
What?

651
00:57:50,391 --> 00:57:53,094
- I think they've forgotten us. - What?

652
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:54,884
It doesn't matter.

653
00:58:02,303 --> 00:58:07,370
63 confirm. Skinnies are moving in on all sides. They need help now.

654
00:58:08,376 --> 00:58:12,442
Indigenous personnel advancing to Wolcott crash site.

655
00:58:13,548 --> 00:58:14,882
Say again. Over.

656
00:58:14,882 --> 00:58:17,480
A lot of people closing in.

657
00:58:19,487 --> 00:58:22,323
How far is Chalk Four from the crash site?

658
00:58:22,323 --> 00:58:25,717
- Six blocks, sir. - They need to haul ass.

659
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,448
Get down! Get down!

660
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:24,245
Scotty, are you okay?

661
00:59:25,987 --> 00:59:27,754
No, don't go back!

662
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:39,523
Get down! Get down!

663
00:59:41,636 --> 00:59:43,233
Technicals!

664
00:59:43,271 --> 00:59:45,061
Got them!

665
00:59:51,979 --> 00:59:54,076
Six o'clock! Move, move!

666
01:00:15,803 --> 01:00:18,094
Go, go, go!

667
01:00:23,377 --> 01:00:24,871
Go, go!

668
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:29,682
Come on!

669
01:00:37,892 --> 01:00:39,887
Yurek, leaving!

670
01:00:42,563 --> 01:00:44,023
Come on!

671
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:15,114
Uniform 64, left turn. Left turn.

672
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:19,593
Romeo 64, I need to know before I get to the goddamn street!

673
01:02:19,593 --> 01:02:22,396
You have to slow down. There's a delay.

674
01:02:22,396 --> 01:02:27,268
From the time directions are relayed from surveillance to JOC, then to me.

675
01:02:27,268 --> 01:02:30,237
We can't slow down! We're taking heavy enemy fire!

676
01:02:30,237 --> 01:02:32,039
We can't slow down!

677
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:36,110
Danny, I'm getting information from Orion surveillance above.

678
01:02:36,110 --> 01:02:38,913
So get me my fucking directions to the crash site!

679
01:02:38,913 --> 01:02:43,217
Danny, hold on. I no longer have the best view of your route.

680
01:02:43,217 --> 01:02:45,886
Get your ass in the right place, goddamn it!

681
01:02:45,886 --> 01:02:49,290
What in the hell is the status of Struecker's humvees?

682
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:52,393
Colonel Harrell, ETA to base, Struecker's column.

683
01:02:52,393 --> 01:02:55,355
ETA to base momentarily.

684
01:03:01,902 --> 01:03:03,635
Open the gate!

685
01:03:25,092 --> 01:03:27,986
- Get him out! Let's go! Let's go! - Come on.

686
01:03:30,364 --> 01:03:31,866
Watch his head.

687
01:03:31,866 --> 01:03:33,531
Easy.

688
01:03:41,142 --> 01:03:44,206
- Blackburn, can you hear me? - Get him to a medic.

689
01:04:18,412 --> 01:04:22,016
Star 41 is at the crash site to evacuate the injured. Over.

690
01:04:22,016 --> 01:04:23,408
Roger that.

691
01:05:02,456 --> 01:05:04,121
I got you.

692
01:05:04,391 --> 01:05:05,885
Easy.

693
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,802
Galentine, you all right?

694
01:05:14,802 --> 01:05:18,639
Galentine, Kurth, with me! Cover fire, now.

695
01:05:18,639 --> 01:05:20,566
Full cover!

696
01:05:34,755 --> 01:05:36,156
How many are in there?

697
01:05:36,156 --> 01:05:39,126
Two pilots are dead, two crew chiefs are wounded!

698
01:05:39,126 --> 01:05:42,918
- He's hurt bad. We must get out of here. - All right. Go ahead.

699
01:06:14,962 --> 01:06:18,959
26, this is 25. Is that you shooting up the technicals?

700
01:06:19,733 --> 01:06:21,402
This is 26. Roger that.

701
01:06:21,402 --> 01:06:25,739
DiTomasso, take the southeast corner. We're setting up a perimeter. Over.

702
01:06:25,739 --> 01:06:28,609
This is 26. Roger that. Moving there now.

703
01:06:28,609 --> 01:06:30,206
Move out!

704
01:06:32,646 --> 01:06:35,346
Captain Steele, come in.

705
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:38,915
Go ahead, 25. This is 64.

706
01:06:38,986 --> 01:06:43,916
We got two wounded and we got both the pilots dead in the chopper!

707
01:06:43,991 --> 01:06:45,883
We need a medivac now!

708
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:51,696
It's too hot to land a bird. You must secure the perimeter first. Over.

709
01:06:52,199 --> 01:06:53,467
Where are the humvees?

710
01:06:53,467 --> 01:06:56,503
Be advised, 25, the convoy will be there.

711
01:06:56,503 --> 01:06:59,931
They're encountering a lot of resistance. 64 out.

712
01:07:11,719 --> 01:07:15,622
- Get the 50 up! - You should see the crash directly ahead.

713
01:07:15,622 --> 01:07:18,390
All I see is a roadblock!

714
01:07:19,226 --> 01:07:21,960
I'll have to figure out another way.

715
01:07:46,954 --> 01:07:50,451
Give me a defensive perimeter so we can load the wounded.

716
01:08:10,310 --> 01:08:12,305
Fire your weapon, Othic!

717
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:27,521
Tell my girls I'll be okay.

718
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:38,428
Medic!

719
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:40,366
Hoo-ah!

720
01:09:08,869 --> 01:09:11,160
Medic! Medic!

721
01:09:11,472 --> 01:09:15,868
Joyce! Joyce! Come on, help me pick him up!

722
01:09:17,044 --> 01:09:21,548
Get us off this fucking street! Where's the crash site? Say again.

723
01:09:21,548 --> 01:09:24,918
Keep going straight 200 meters.

724
01:09:24,918 --> 01:09:26,344
Roger that.

725
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:29,218
Let's go!

726
01:09:29,456 --> 01:09:31,747
Let's go, goddamn it, let's go!

727
01:09:49,743 --> 01:09:52,568
Hey, Twombles. Come here.

728
01:09:56,483 --> 01:09:59,081
The humvees ain't coming back, dude.

729
01:09:59,419 --> 01:10:00,811
What?

730
01:10:01,922 --> 01:10:03,891
Were we supposed to go to them?

731
01:10:03,891 --> 01:10:06,284
I thought they were coming to us.

732
01:10:08,262 --> 01:10:11,087
- I think we're supposed to go to them. - Shit.

733
01:10:14,134 --> 01:10:15,769
Let's go to the crash site.

734
01:10:15,769 --> 01:10:16,937
Okay.

735
01:10:16,937 --> 01:10:20,440
Don't fire that thing so close to my head. I can barely hear as it is.

736
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:21,729
Move out.

737
01:10:34,521 --> 01:10:36,448
Shit! Get down!

738
01:10:38,292 --> 01:10:42,084
What did I just tell you? If you do that again...

739
01:10:46,133 --> 01:10:48,458
You okay? Nelson.

740
01:10:48,802 --> 01:10:51,434
You all right?

741
01:10:51,672 --> 01:10:55,100
Search and rescue bird on station inserting medics.

742
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:07,909
Go!

743
01:11:12,092 --> 01:11:13,882
Go, go!

744
01:11:15,963 --> 01:11:19,600
Son of a bitch. C-2, this is 68. We've been hit.

745
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:23,136
Super 68, there is smoke coming from the top of your rotor.

746
01:11:23,136 --> 01:11:25,563
- Advise you to come out now. - Roger.

747
01:11:25,772 --> 01:11:27,471
Dropping last man.

748
01:11:29,776 --> 01:11:34,281
Art, I've got skinnies with RPGs at 12:00. Can you see them?

749
01:11:34,281 --> 01:11:36,742
Got them. Give me 90 degrees left.

750
01:11:46,526 --> 01:11:48,088
68 coming out.

751
01:11:49,796 --> 01:11:52,462
Super 68 is out. Over.

752
01:12:02,075 --> 01:12:04,911
Hey, Wilkie, what's the situation in there?

753
01:12:04,911 --> 01:12:07,042
Both pilots are dead.

754
01:12:07,581 --> 01:12:10,851
25, we can't move these guys, Matty.

755
01:12:10,851 --> 01:12:12,753
We'll kill them just carrying them.

756
01:12:12,753 --> 01:12:15,453
- Stabilize in here? - Roger.

757
01:12:15,522 --> 01:12:18,759
Stabilize in the bird. Repeat: Stabilize in here. Over.

758
01:12:18,759 --> 01:12:20,927
Understood, Wilkie. We got you covered. Over.

759
01:12:20,927 --> 01:12:24,719
Super 64, come inbound and take Wolcott's position.

760
01:12:25,365 --> 01:12:27,997
Roger. 64 is inbound.

761
01:12:54,861 --> 01:12:56,530
Super 64, you all right?

762
01:12:56,530 --> 01:12:59,533
This is Super 64. We're good.

763
01:12:59,533 --> 01:13:02,602
You sure? You look like you got clipped pretty good.

764
01:13:02,602 --> 01:13:04,893
Instrument panels are okay.

765
01:13:04,905 --> 01:13:09,039
No, we're good. Got a slight vibration in the pedals, but we're good.

766
01:13:09,576 --> 01:13:14,245
All right, put her down on the airfield, 64. Have it checked out just to be safe.

767
01:13:14,414 --> 01:13:15,703
Roger.

768
01:13:18,085 --> 01:13:22,549
I'm getting movement in these pedals. Check the systems again.

769
01:13:37,437 --> 01:13:40,107
We lost the tail rotor! It's gone!

770
01:13:40,107 --> 01:13:42,102
64 is going down!

771
01:13:42,943 --> 01:13:44,767
64 is going in hard.

772
01:13:46,313 --> 01:13:48,342
64 going down.

773
01:13:52,953 --> 01:13:55,118
We're going down.

774
01:13:59,793 --> 01:14:01,762
Get Struecker's column back out there.

775
01:14:01,762 --> 01:14:04,131
They need to get to Durant's crash site fast.

776
01:14:04,131 --> 01:14:07,059
- Another bird down. - I want them out of there.

777
01:14:07,467 --> 01:14:08,734
All of them.

778
01:14:12,773 --> 01:14:16,176
Captain Steele, we got to move or we'll get pinned down!

779
01:14:16,176 --> 01:14:18,278
We're moving as fast as we can.

780
01:14:18,278 --> 01:14:21,741
You let me do my job and you do yours. Over.

781
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:32,659
- Fuck! Fuck! - Ruiz stay down.

782
01:14:32,659 --> 01:14:33,894
- I fucking knew... - Medic.

783
01:14:33,894 --> 01:14:37,931
Fuck this! Captain Steele, I'll take out the threat in the window.

784
01:14:37,931 --> 01:14:40,267
We'll rally at the gray building. Coming through.

785
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:41,034
Sarg'nt!

786
01:14:41,034 --> 01:14:42,494
All right, let's move!

787
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:49,638
Cover me!

788
01:14:55,182 --> 01:14:58,144
- Let's go, let's move! - Moving out.

789
01:15:03,557 --> 01:15:04,157
Friendly!

790
01:15:04,157 --> 01:15:05,959
Friendlies coming through!

791
01:15:05,959 --> 01:15:08,562
Let's go, let's go! Move up!

792
01:15:08,562 --> 01:15:10,762
Come on, come on!

793
01:15:10,964 --> 01:15:12,288
Come on!

794
01:15:19,673 --> 01:15:21,668
Move up! Go! Move up!

795
01:15:21,775 --> 01:15:23,577
What the fuck are you doing out there?

796
01:15:23,577 --> 01:15:26,573
Doing my job! We got to get to that crash site!

797
01:15:26,613 --> 01:15:29,711
We got to get on that street, and we got to move!

798
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:32,118
And you have got to keep up, sir!

799
01:15:32,118 --> 01:15:34,354
Don't you ever give me orders, Sergeant.

800
01:15:34,354 --> 01:15:37,122
We are combat ineffective, understand?

801
01:15:37,424 --> 01:15:39,025
We got too many wounded to move!

802
01:15:39,025 --> 01:15:42,556
Then give me some shooters and I'll circle us to the bird.

803
01:15:44,965 --> 01:15:47,634
Grimes! You're with Chalk Four?

804
01:15:47,634 --> 01:15:48,869
Yes, sir!

805
01:15:48,869 --> 01:15:52,605
All right, hook up with Delta! Rejoin with Sergeant Eversmann.

806
01:15:52,873 --> 01:15:55,342
The rest of you, secure this position!

807
01:15:55,342 --> 01:15:57,644
Treat the wounded, we'll wait for the convoy!

808
01:15:57,644 --> 01:16:00,380
Then we'll rally at the crash site. Roger!

809
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:02,045
My guys, let's go!

810
01:16:32,679 --> 01:16:35,749
C- 2, I have two Delta snipers, Shughart and Gordon...

811
01:16:35,749 --> 01:16:38,745
...volunteering to secure crash site two. Over.

812
01:16:39,085 --> 01:16:43,549
No, Super 62, negative that request. Can't risk another bird.

813
01:16:45,091 --> 01:16:49,327
We don't see anything moving down there, we don't even know if anyone's alive.

814
01:16:50,297 --> 01:16:53,199
A ground team is being organized to go in now.

815
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:55,101
ETA on ground team? Over.

816
01:16:55,101 --> 01:16:58,371
Unknown, not long.

817
01:16:58,371 --> 01:17:01,003
Do what you can from the air.

818
01:17:04,711 --> 01:17:06,613
All right, gather around!

819
01:17:06,613 --> 01:17:09,916
Durant's 64 is down. We're going back in to get him!

820
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:12,118
That's crazy. Is there anyone alive?

821
01:17:12,118 --> 01:17:14,754
Doesn't matter, no one gets left behind.

822
01:17:14,754 --> 01:17:17,123
We're wasting time here.

823
01:17:17,123 --> 01:17:20,449
Refit and max out ammo and grenades, you got five!

824
01:17:21,394 --> 01:17:23,296
Sizemore, where are you going?

825
01:17:23,296 --> 01:17:26,429
- With you guys. - Not with that cast on you're not.

826
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,599
All right, all right, all right. Go get your k-pot.

827
01:17:32,572 --> 01:17:34,066
Talk to me.

828
01:17:34,074 --> 01:17:35,508
I can't go back out there.

829
01:17:35,508 --> 01:17:40,280
Thomas, everyone feels the same way you do. All right?

830
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:43,777
It's what you do right now that makes a difference.

831
01:17:44,517 --> 01:17:46,307
It's your call.

832
01:17:46,453 --> 01:17:47,811
Hoo-ah?

833
01:17:53,693 --> 01:17:55,221
Hoo-ah.

834
01:18:11,277 --> 01:18:15,206
It'll probably help to wash the blood out of the humvees.

835
01:18:23,890 --> 01:18:26,124
Sergeant Struecker!

836
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:30,126
Sergeant Struecker! Can I go, Sarge?

837
01:18:30,263 --> 01:18:32,332
- You got some ammo? - Roger, Sarge!

838
01:18:32,332 --> 01:18:34,224
Hop in!

839
01:18:51,951 --> 01:18:53,616
Wait!

840
01:18:54,254 --> 01:18:56,715
Let's go, Thomas. Get in!

841
01:19:20,213 --> 01:19:21,673
Which way?

842
01:19:26,386 --> 01:19:29,678
- That way, I think! - Not so fucking loud.

843
01:20:03,156 --> 01:20:04,787
Nice donkey.

844
01:20:23,109 --> 01:20:24,808
Rangers?

845
01:20:25,011 --> 01:20:26,300
Who?

846
01:20:26,846 --> 01:20:30,583
It's Yurek! You fucking assholes!

847
01:20:30,583 --> 01:20:32,185
Fuck!

848
01:20:32,185 --> 01:20:34,988
Dude, we almost fucking killed you!

849
01:20:34,988 --> 01:20:38,382
- Come to us! - Fuck you, come to me.

850
01:20:50,537 --> 01:20:52,038
Sorry, Sarge!

851
01:20:52,038 --> 01:20:54,040
Dude, where the fuck have you been?

852
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:55,975
Never mind, you brought NOD, right?

853
01:20:55,975 --> 01:20:58,378
No, I didn't and you want to know why?

854
01:20:58,378 --> 01:21:01,815
Because you said: "You won't need that, we'll be back in a half-hour."

855
01:21:01,815 --> 01:21:03,449
Well, I wasn't saying it to you.

856
01:21:03,449 --> 01:21:05,740
Nelson, cover this way.

857
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:07,487
We'll need night vision.

858
01:21:07,487 --> 01:21:10,187
What's the matter with you?

859
01:21:10,256 --> 01:21:13,320
Oh, he's deaf. It's my fault.

860
01:21:13,326 --> 01:21:15,662
- We need to get out of here! - That way.

861
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:19,625
We can't be far from the crash. Which way?

862
01:21:19,999 --> 01:21:22,028
I thought you might know.

863
01:21:22,468 --> 01:21:24,201
Let's move out.

864
01:21:29,475 --> 01:21:32,335
Nelson, Twombly? Come in. Over.

865
01:21:33,112 --> 01:21:37,610
Nelson, Twombly, this is Galentine. We need a position of the convoy. Over.

866
01:21:38,351 --> 01:21:40,854
I can't raise them, Sergeant.

867
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:43,816
Sir, let's get the fuck out of here and evac!

868
01:21:44,991 --> 01:21:48,294
- Let's move out. - Back to the stronghold!

869
01:21:48,294 --> 01:21:49,583
Come on!

870
01:21:51,564 --> 01:21:54,868
Ground forces have occupied several buildings along Marehan Road...

871
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:56,636
...but they're all spread out.

872
01:21:56,636 --> 01:22:01,307
Eversmann's Chalk Four has set up a perimeter around Wolcott's crash site.

873
01:22:01,307 --> 01:22:03,939
DiTomasso is in the adjacent structure.

874
01:22:04,010 --> 01:22:08,014
Captain Steele and about 40 men, Rangers, are here, a couple blocks away.

875
01:22:08,014 --> 01:22:09,616
They're banged up pretty bad.

876
01:22:09,616 --> 01:22:14,721
He set up a casualty collection point, I don't think they'll be able to move.

877
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:17,290
Sergeant Sanderson and a small Delta team...

878
01:22:17,290 --> 01:22:21,458
...are moving from Steele's position to the crash site as we speak.

879
01:22:32,171 --> 01:22:33,406
Draw off fire!

880
01:22:33,406 --> 01:22:36,676
When this asshole stops to reload, cover me!

881
01:22:36,676 --> 01:22:38,409
- Go! - Sir.

882
01:22:41,614 --> 01:22:42,881
Again!

883
01:22:47,687 --> 01:22:49,454
Loading!

884
01:22:51,524 --> 01:22:53,314
Keep going!

885
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,789
I'm jammed!

886
01:22:56,663 --> 01:22:58,430
I got it!

887
01:22:59,365 --> 01:23:01,428
No, shit!

888
01:23:13,713 --> 01:23:15,275
RPG!

889
01:23:29,929 --> 01:23:32,665
You all right? You okay?

890
01:23:32,665 --> 01:23:35,934
Yeah. I can hear bells ringing.

891
01:23:37,236 --> 01:23:39,766
Come on! Come on!

892
01:23:41,207 --> 01:23:42,496
Go!

893
01:23:49,415 --> 01:23:52,485
A crowd is advancing six, seven blocks from the crash.

894
01:23:52,485 --> 01:23:54,854
Shughart and Gordon again request permission...

895
01:23:54,854 --> 01:23:58,491
...to secure until convoy arrives. Over.

896
01:23:58,491 --> 01:24:01,794
General, crowds are in the hundreds now.

897
01:24:01,794 --> 01:24:05,365
From where they are, they can see things clearer than any of us.

898
01:24:05,365 --> 01:24:07,467
They know what they're asking.

899
01:24:07,467 --> 01:24:09,135
Let me talk to them.

900
01:24:09,135 --> 01:24:10,303
This is Garrison.

901
01:24:10,303 --> 01:24:14,869
I want to make sure that you understand what you're asking, so say it out loud.

902
01:24:16,642 --> 01:24:20,935
We're asking to go in and set up a perimeter until ground support arrives.

903
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:25,444
You realize that I cannot tell you when that might be, it could take a while.

904
01:24:26,052 --> 01:24:28,877
- Roger that. - You still want to go in there?

905
01:24:28,921 --> 01:24:30,017
Yes, sir.

906
01:24:33,726 --> 01:24:35,428
- Colonel Harrell? - Yes, General?

907
01:24:35,428 --> 01:24:36,786
It's your call.

908
01:24:37,663 --> 01:24:39,453
Roger that.

909
01:24:40,933 --> 01:24:43,428
Goffena, put them in.

910
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:59,113
Motherfucker. Motherfucker.

911
01:25:03,990 --> 01:25:05,279
RPG!

912
01:25:14,867 --> 01:25:16,759
Set up your perimeter!

913
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:25,978
There's a fucking rocket in him, sir!

914
01:25:25,978 --> 01:25:30,146
Othic, calm down, goddamn it! There's live ordnance, now get out!

915
01:25:31,150 --> 01:25:33,281
Son of a bitch.

916
01:25:34,487 --> 01:25:37,950
All right, lift him up! Lift him up! Easy, easy!

917
01:25:37,957 --> 01:25:41,351
All right, get him in there! Good, good! Easy, easy!

918
01:25:42,261 --> 01:25:43,863
Get in that truck and drive.

919
01:25:43,863 --> 01:25:45,998
- But I'm shot, Colonel. - Everybody's shot.

920
01:25:45,998 --> 01:25:48,391
We need the prisoners! Let's go!

921
01:25:49,168 --> 01:25:52,905
Surveillance says to take Hawlwadig, then go straight.

922
01:25:52,905 --> 01:25:57,343
McKnight, we need you to turn around and head back to Hawlwadig.

923
01:25:57,343 --> 01:25:59,679
You're shitting me! We just came through there!

924
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:01,514
There must be a better route!

925
01:26:01,514 --> 01:26:06,979
That's the info I'm getting from JOC, you need to turn around and head back.

926
01:26:07,954 --> 01:26:10,279
Roger that. Roger that.

927
01:26:10,456 --> 01:26:13,392
I cannot believe this shit! Turn us around, Maddox.

928
01:26:13,392 --> 01:26:15,428
They're trying to get us fucking killed!

929
01:26:15,428 --> 01:26:17,096
Just get it over with! Drive!

930
01:26:17,096 --> 01:26:18,364
Goddamn!

931
01:26:18,364 --> 01:26:20,996
Get us out of here, goddamn it, drive!

932
01:26:28,407 --> 01:26:29,909
Keep your foot on the gas!

933
01:26:29,909 --> 01:26:32,439
Keep your foot on the gas!

934
01:26:43,656 --> 01:26:45,014
Fuck!

935
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:48,949
Shit.

936
01:27:04,110 --> 01:27:07,079
C- 2, Shughart and Gordon are on the deck. Over.

937
01:27:07,079 --> 01:27:08,346
Roger.

938
01:27:34,140 --> 01:27:35,998
Friendlies!

939
01:27:37,877 --> 01:27:39,178
God, it's good to see you!

940
01:27:39,178 --> 01:27:41,214
It's good to see you. How bad?

941
01:27:41,214 --> 01:27:44,250
My leg's broken and my back feels kind of weird.

942
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:46,643
We've got to get you out of here.

943
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:49,451
I'm pulling him out! Cover!

944
01:27:52,558 --> 01:27:53,847
Wait, I...

945
01:28:02,101 --> 01:28:03,603
I'm putting you down.

946
01:28:03,603 --> 01:28:06,606
C-2, we're at the 64 crash site, securing perimeter.

947
01:28:06,606 --> 01:28:08,274
- You all right? - Yeah, I'm good.

948
01:28:08,274 --> 01:28:09,775
You're locked and loaded.

949
01:28:09,775 --> 01:28:13,579
Any skinnies come around these corners, you watch our backs.

950
01:28:13,579 --> 01:28:16,541
- Where's the rescue squad? - We're it.

951
01:28:21,954 --> 01:28:25,348
All right, stop, stop, Maddox. Stop.

952
01:28:26,058 --> 01:28:27,627
Son of a bitch.

953
01:28:27,627 --> 01:28:30,730
Romeo 64, we're back where we started.

954
01:28:30,730 --> 01:28:33,499
I'm low on ammo, I got many wounded including me...

955
01:28:33,499 --> 01:28:35,534
...vehicles that are barely running.

956
01:28:35,534 --> 01:28:38,769
Okay, Danny, I need a no-b.s. Assessment here.

957
01:28:38,904 --> 01:28:41,331
Can you get to the crash site?

958
01:28:41,774 --> 01:28:44,668
Colonel, I can't see shit.

959
01:28:48,447 --> 01:28:49,415
Negative.

960
01:28:49,415 --> 01:28:52,551
With the amount of wounded we have, we'd do more harm than good.

961
01:28:52,551 --> 01:28:56,589
We need to come back to base, rearm and regroup and then we can go back out.

962
01:28:56,589 --> 01:28:57,878
Roger.

963
01:28:59,425 --> 01:29:02,990
C-2, bring them back. Get them out of there.

964
01:29:04,163 --> 01:29:06,055
Roger. Return to base.

965
01:29:06,565 --> 01:29:08,134
We're going home!

966
01:29:08,134 --> 01:29:10,425
Let's go. Left.

967
01:29:23,011 --> 01:29:26,610
Roger that. Understand. Convoy returning to base.

968
01:29:31,586 --> 01:29:33,755
- What's up? - They're sending them back.

969
01:29:33,755 --> 01:29:35,490
The convoy's headed back to base camp.

970
01:29:35,490 --> 01:29:37,951
Oh, now that makes sense, don't it?

971
01:29:38,159 --> 01:29:42,486
We need to exfil the wounded now and get out of here before it's too late!

972
01:29:42,530 --> 01:29:46,267
If Colonel McKnight went back to base, then he had a good reason.

973
01:29:46,267 --> 01:29:47,935
It changes nothing.

974
01:29:47,935 --> 01:29:49,404
All right, listen up.

975
01:29:49,404 --> 01:29:53,697
We're going to hold the perimeter and we're going to hold the strongpoint.

976
01:29:54,175 --> 01:29:57,740
Conserve your ammo. Only shoot at what you can hit.

977
01:29:59,247 --> 01:30:01,344
The convoy is going to come.

978
01:30:02,450 --> 01:30:03,739
We're going to get home.

979
01:30:15,930 --> 01:30:17,219
Loading!

980
01:30:25,406 --> 01:30:27,037
Loading!

981
01:30:27,275 --> 01:30:29,372
Randy, I need a pistol mag!

982
01:30:42,457 --> 01:30:43,746
Loading!

983
01:30:47,195 --> 01:30:48,894
Randy, last mag!

984
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:53,424
Gordy!

985
01:30:56,871 --> 01:30:58,160
Fuck!

986
01:31:11,352 --> 01:31:13,847
Gordy is gone, man. I'll be outside.

987
01:31:14,122 --> 01:31:15,548
Good luck.

988
01:31:36,677 --> 01:31:39,614
We need the 10th Mountain in there. Everything they got.

989
01:31:39,614 --> 01:31:43,042
Pakistanis, Malays, I want their tanks and APCs.

990
01:31:43,384 --> 01:31:44,852
They don't know we've gone in.

991
01:31:44,852 --> 01:31:49,589
We have stirred up a hornet's nest here. We're fighting the entire city.

992
01:31:49,791 --> 01:31:54,662
I want every vehicle possible that's got 4 wheels and armor. Get everything.

993
01:31:54,662 --> 01:31:58,032
Once they've assembled, we'll move our men out of the hostile area...

994
01:31:58,032 --> 01:32:00,701
...and back to the Pakistani Stadium, the safe zone.

995
01:32:00,701 --> 01:32:03,526
- Now, let's go. - Roger that.

996
01:34:17,872 --> 01:34:19,901
Mohamed Farrah Aidid...

997
01:34:20,608 --> 01:34:22,500
claims this prisoner...

998
01:34:22,710 --> 01:34:24,671
... alive!

999
01:34:40,094 --> 01:34:43,022
On your knees! Get down! Get down!

1000
01:34:47,368 --> 01:34:51,604
Stay with me. You just got a bullet in the leg.

1001
01:34:55,843 --> 01:34:58,846
See where those tires are burning? All that black smoke?

1002
01:34:58,846 --> 01:35:02,583
Roger. I can see it, but I can't get there. Over.

1003
01:35:02,583 --> 01:35:05,886
Go 100 meters past it. That's the crash.

1004
01:35:05,886 --> 01:35:08,155
Negative. You don't understand.

1005
01:35:08,155 --> 01:35:12,983
It's roadblock after roadblock. You have to find us another route. Over.

1006
01:35:13,327 --> 01:35:17,031
There ain't one. The only other route is all the way around the city.

1007
01:35:17,031 --> 01:35:18,199
Roger that.

1008
01:35:18,199 --> 01:35:20,935
Kilo 64, this is Kilo 11.

1009
01:35:20,935 --> 01:35:25,695
Request permission to move to crash site number two on foot. Over.

1010
01:35:26,307 --> 01:35:28,409
Green light, Kilo 11.

1011
01:35:28,409 --> 01:35:31,109
Stop the vehicle. Let me out.

1012
01:36:15,890 --> 01:36:19,560
After I'm finished with this, I'll whip you boys up some margaritas.

1013
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:22,727
The usual. Blended, no salt.

1014
01:36:29,637 --> 01:36:33,134
This is Kilo 12. We've got to change our position. Over.

1015
01:36:46,620 --> 01:36:48,589
Eversmann, come in.

1016
01:36:48,589 --> 01:36:49,981
Eversmann.

1017
01:36:52,126 --> 01:36:54,528
- Roger who is this? - Sanderson.

1018
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:59,265
Do not... I say again, do not fire to the east. We are coming to you.

1019
01:37:00,434 --> 01:37:01,836
Understood.

1020
01:37:01,836 --> 01:37:04,338
DiTomasso and his men are on the southeast corner.

1021
01:37:04,338 --> 01:37:06,774
We need you on the northeast building.

1022
01:37:06,774 --> 01:37:08,541
Roger. We'll take it.

1023
01:37:08,843 --> 01:37:11,145
Watch out for skinnies. They're on the rooftops.

1024
01:37:11,145 --> 01:37:13,936
They're in prayer but not for much longer.

1025
01:37:17,118 --> 01:37:19,215
Hold your fire to the east.

1026
01:37:41,008 --> 01:37:43,003
Eversmann? It's Yurek.

1027
01:37:43,077 --> 01:37:45,777
I got Nelson and Twombly with me.

1028
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:48,883
We got the chopper in sight. Where are you?

1029
01:37:48,883 --> 01:37:52,086
We're on the southwest corner. Where have you been? Are you okay?

1030
01:37:52,086 --> 01:37:53,250
Yeah.

1031
01:37:54,522 --> 01:37:56,949
Hold your fire. We're coming in.

1032
01:38:01,462 --> 01:38:02,596
We got to go.

1033
01:38:02,596 --> 01:38:05,699
Shawn, listen! Sergeant Yurek's going to run first.

1034
01:38:05,699 --> 01:38:09,737
When he gets across the street, he'll turn around and cover you as you run.

1035
01:38:09,737 --> 01:38:14,167
Listen closely. When you get there, you'll turn around and cover me, okay?

1036
01:38:15,509 --> 01:38:17,912
You won't just run to Eversmann's position.

1037
01:38:17,912 --> 01:38:21,045
You're going to stop and you are going to cover me.

1038
01:38:21,248 --> 01:38:23,709
It's important you understand that.

1039
01:38:23,884 --> 01:38:25,549
Okay, you ready?

1040
01:38:26,053 --> 01:38:27,718
Yeah, I guess.

1041
01:38:32,993 --> 01:38:34,851
- Don't forget. - What?

1042
01:38:35,229 --> 01:38:36,757
Don't forget.

1043
01:38:49,977 --> 01:38:53,414
I got them in my sight, Sarg'nt. They're coming up on the west gate.

1044
01:38:53,414 --> 01:38:54,840
I see them.

1045
01:38:57,484 --> 01:38:59,081
Let's move out.

1046
01:39:01,222 --> 01:39:03,190
Can you cover us, Sergeant?

1047
01:39:03,190 --> 01:39:04,821
We got you.

1048
01:39:11,765 --> 01:39:13,464
Nelson!

1049
01:39:19,974 --> 01:39:21,263
Fuck!

1050
01:39:29,483 --> 01:39:30,772
Twombly!

1051
01:39:32,286 --> 01:39:33,554
Smith! No!

1052
01:39:33,554 --> 01:39:35,116
You all right?

1053
01:39:38,158 --> 01:39:39,823
Get it off of me!

1054
01:39:40,294 --> 01:39:41,993
Get it off!

1055
01:39:42,997 --> 01:39:44,924
Come on, man. Come on.

1056
01:39:45,799 --> 01:39:49,034
Doc! Need some help with Smith here!

1057
01:39:57,144 --> 01:39:58,512
My leg! My leg!

1058
01:39:58,512 --> 01:40:00,507
Come on, Jamie, I got you!

1059
01:40:07,288 --> 01:40:09,613
Up, one, two, three.

1060
01:40:10,658 --> 01:40:13,394
- You're all right. - I need some pressure on this wound.

1061
01:40:13,394 --> 01:40:14,528
My right thigh!

1062
01:40:14,528 --> 01:40:16,397
Pressure, yeah.

1063
01:40:16,397 --> 01:40:18,799
- Are my balls okay? - You still have your balls.

1064
01:40:18,799 --> 01:40:19,967
I need more men in here.

1065
01:40:19,967 --> 01:40:22,636
Twombly! Nelson!

1066
01:40:22,636 --> 01:40:25,996
- Put him down. - Oh, man, that really...

1067
01:40:27,041 --> 01:40:29,343
- It really hurts! - Direct pressure on that.

1068
01:40:29,343 --> 01:40:31,133
It's okay, it's okay.

1069
01:40:31,412 --> 01:40:34,078
- Let me see it! - All right.

1070
01:40:34,248 --> 01:40:36,812
All right, let me get a look at that.

1071
01:40:36,917 --> 01:40:38,519
Oh, shit!

1072
01:40:38,519 --> 01:40:39,954
Oh, fuck!

1073
01:40:39,954 --> 01:40:42,423
- What the fuck was that? - It's all right.

1074
01:40:42,423 --> 01:40:44,658
Hold that down. I need a medivac now.

1075
01:40:44,658 --> 01:40:46,260
Fuck. Galentine!

1076
01:40:46,260 --> 01:40:47,328
It's all right.

1077
01:40:47,328 --> 01:40:49,425
Galentine! Get me Captain Steele!

1078
01:40:50,064 --> 01:40:53,167
- Sarg'nt Ruiz, how you doing? - Juliet 64, come in. Over.

1079
01:40:53,167 --> 01:40:57,137
They're not going to come and get us. They're not going to come for us.

1080
01:40:57,137 --> 01:41:00,274
I need you to suck it up, Sarg'nt. I need you to focus.

1081
01:41:00,274 --> 01:41:02,743
- Can you do that? - Juliet 64, come in. Over.

1082
01:41:02,743 --> 01:41:04,943
Now, can you hold your weapon?

1083
01:41:05,012 --> 01:41:06,246
Yes, sir.

1084
01:41:06,246 --> 01:41:10,539
Anybody comes through that door gets two in the chest and one in the head.

1085
01:41:10,584 --> 01:41:14,288
- You understand? - I'm still in the fight, sir.

1086
01:41:14,288 --> 01:41:17,424
Captain Steele, I need a medivac in here now!

1087
01:41:17,424 --> 01:41:20,215
- Corporal Smith has been hit! - Hold on, 25.

1088
01:41:20,260 --> 01:41:21,762
Still in the fight.

1089
01:41:21,762 --> 01:41:23,297
He's hurt pretty bad.

1090
01:41:23,297 --> 01:41:27,101
25, we got wounded too. You'll have to maintain your situation, over.

1091
01:41:27,101 --> 01:41:29,961
If he doesn't get help in a half-hour, he's in trouble!

1092
01:41:30,437 --> 01:41:32,740
C- 2, this is 64.

1093
01:41:32,740 --> 01:41:37,044
Requesting a medivac for a critically wounded at Chalk Four's location. Over.

1094
01:41:37,044 --> 01:41:40,114
Command, Chalk Four is requesting medivac.

1095
01:41:40,114 --> 01:41:42,746
Can't risk it. It's still too hot.

1096
01:41:42,916 --> 01:41:48,085
Captain, we cannot send in medivac at this time. Sit tight. Over.

1097
01:41:48,122 --> 01:41:52,159
25, this is 64. Negative on the medivac. It's not possible.

1098
01:41:52,159 --> 01:41:56,225
JOC cannot risk another bird. You'll just have to hold on.

1099
01:42:02,503 --> 01:42:04,004
All right. I got him.

1100
01:42:04,004 --> 01:42:06,738
I want direct pressure on the wound.

1101
01:42:08,308 --> 01:42:10,405
It's going to be all right.

1102
01:42:49,183 --> 01:42:52,350
I think this is mine!

1103
01:42:54,688 --> 01:42:58,025
This is Kilo 11. I'm at the Durant crash site.

1104
01:42:58,025 --> 01:42:59,724
Roger that.

1105
01:43:21,014 --> 01:43:23,016
Crash site two secured.

1106
01:43:23,016 --> 01:43:25,682
Lieutenant Colonel Cribbs for you, sir.

1107
01:43:25,886 --> 01:43:26,858
Cribbs?

1108
01:43:28,755 --> 01:43:31,191
- They're still debating the route. - How long?

1109
01:43:31,191 --> 01:43:32,993
At least a couple of hours.

1110
01:43:32,993 --> 01:43:34,728
We haven't got that long, Joe.

1111
01:43:34,728 --> 01:43:39,533
Pakistani General says, since we didn't deign to inform him of the raid...

1112
01:43:39,533 --> 01:43:43,637
...it'll take some time to mobilize the 10th Mountain and 100 vehicles.

1113
01:43:43,637 --> 01:43:45,839
You tell the general this:

1114
01:43:45,839 --> 01:43:48,942
I understand, but it is my duty to remind him...

1115
01:43:48,942 --> 01:43:53,213
...that my men are surrounded by thousands of armed Somali militia.

1116
01:43:53,213 --> 01:43:58,685
It's imperative that we move them out of the hostile area and into the safe zone.

1117
01:43:58,685 --> 01:44:00,509
I need his help now.

1118
01:44:01,221 --> 01:44:02,749
Yes, sir.

1119
01:44:07,561 --> 01:44:09,089
Durant.

1120
01:44:09,496 --> 01:44:12,264
Michael Durant.

1121
01:44:12,699 --> 01:44:13,988
Yes.

1122
01:44:14,167 --> 01:44:16,770
You are the Ranger who kills my people?

1123
01:44:16,770 --> 01:44:20,471
I'm not a Ranger. I'm a pilot.

1124
01:44:24,111 --> 01:44:25,708
That's right.

1125
01:44:26,079 --> 01:44:29,371
None of you Americans smoke anymore.

1126
01:44:32,285 --> 01:44:37,215
You all live long, dull, uninteresting lives.

1127
01:44:38,792 --> 01:44:40,957
What do you want with me?

1128
01:44:41,495 --> 01:44:43,524
You have taken hostages.

1129
01:44:44,231 --> 01:44:46,032
We have you.

1130
01:44:46,032 --> 01:44:49,426
My government will never negotiate for me.

1131
01:44:49,669 --> 01:44:54,531
Then perhaps you and I can negotiate, huh?

1132
01:44:55,709 --> 01:44:58,534
Soldier to soldier.

1133
01:45:04,184 --> 01:45:06,281
I'm not in charge.

1134
01:45:09,256 --> 01:45:13,993
Course not. You have the power to kill, but not negotiate.

1135
01:45:14,161 --> 01:45:17,362
In Somalia, killing is negotiation.

1136
01:45:18,632 --> 01:45:22,202
Do you really think if you get General Aidid...

1137
01:45:22,202 --> 01:45:25,705
...we will simply put down our weapons...

1138
01:45:25,705 --> 01:45:28,997
...and adopt American democracy?

1139
01:45:29,142 --> 01:45:31,239
That the killing will stop?

1140
01:45:31,344 --> 01:45:35,705
We know this: Without victory, there can be no peace.

1141
01:45:36,183 --> 01:45:38,917
There will always be killing, you see?

1142
01:45:39,085 --> 01:45:41,580
This is how things are in our world.

1143
01:45:54,134 --> 01:45:58,097
Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind.

1144
01:45:59,940 --> 01:46:03,676
Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind.

1145
01:46:06,112 --> 01:46:09,279
You got to take over from me. Both hands.

1146
01:46:16,690 --> 01:46:20,126
It's the femoral artery, but I can't see it.

1147
01:46:20,126 --> 01:46:23,797
Which means that it's retracted up into the pelvis.

1148
01:46:23,797 --> 01:46:28,301
I have to find it and clamp it. It's the only way to stop the bleeding.

1149
01:46:28,301 --> 01:46:30,694
I got no more IVs.

1150
01:46:31,671 --> 01:46:34,708
So, I'm going to need you to assist. Okay?

1151
01:46:34,708 --> 01:46:36,635
Yeah, yeah.

1152
01:46:37,277 --> 01:46:40,944
Now listen, Jamie. I got to do something, it's going to hurt.

1153
01:46:41,915 --> 01:46:45,819
I got to cause you more pain, but I have to do it to help you.

1154
01:46:45,819 --> 01:46:47,420
All right, you understand?

1155
01:46:47,420 --> 01:46:49,623
- Morphine. - I can't.

1156
01:46:49,623 --> 01:46:52,292
It'll lower your heart rate too far. I'm sorry.

1157
01:46:52,292 --> 01:46:54,890
Twombly, why don't you take his hands?

1158
01:46:59,099 --> 01:47:02,102
Hold the wound open, keep pressure on the top of the leg.

1159
01:47:02,102 --> 01:47:04,597
Yurek, take the feet and a flashlight.

1160
01:47:04,704 --> 01:47:05,906
On my count.

1161
01:47:05,906 --> 01:47:08,197
All right, Jamie. All right.

1162
01:47:10,176 --> 01:47:12,637
1 2
One. Two.

1163
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:14,638
Three.

1164
01:47:22,055 --> 01:47:24,789
Wait, wait. Okay. I feel it.

1165
01:47:25,125 --> 01:47:26,790
I feel the pulse.

1166
01:47:28,061 --> 01:47:29,462
I got it. I got it.

1167
01:47:29,462 --> 01:47:31,131
I got it, yeah. I got it.

1168
01:47:31,131 --> 01:47:33,023
- I got it. - You got it?

1169
01:47:33,166 --> 01:47:34,455
Clamp?

1170
01:47:36,570 --> 01:47:38,071
I got it clamped.

1171
01:47:38,071 --> 01:47:39,339
- Hold it. - Got it.

1172
01:47:39,339 --> 01:47:40,901
Here, grab it.

1173
01:47:41,274 --> 01:47:43,243
- It's tearing. - I got it.

1174
01:47:43,243 --> 01:47:45,178
- Doc, it's going back in! - Hold it!

1175
01:47:45,178 --> 01:47:46,706
It's tearing!

1176
01:47:46,746 --> 01:47:50,015
- Okay. Get out. Hold the wound. - Okay, I'm holding.

1177
01:47:50,951 --> 01:47:52,548
Move your hand.

1178
01:48:03,463 --> 01:48:04,991
What?

1179
01:48:23,817 --> 01:48:25,106
Fix it?

1180
01:48:28,421 --> 01:48:31,155
Yeah, yeah. We got it.

1181
01:48:46,506 --> 01:48:48,375
What the hell are you doing?

1182
01:48:48,375 --> 01:48:52,979
It's all in the grind, Sarg'nt. Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.

1183
01:48:52,979 --> 01:48:55,941
Grimesy, you are squared away.

1184
01:49:11,965 --> 01:49:16,224
Sarg'nt, how would you like a nice hot cup of Joe?

1185
01:49:17,737 --> 01:49:19,539
Gold Coast blend.

1186
01:49:19,539 --> 01:49:22,774
Sit down. I want to take a look at that foot.

1187
01:49:23,076 --> 01:49:25,469
- No, it's not a problem. - Come on.

1188
01:49:31,618 --> 01:49:35,012
- Where the hell did they find you? - Behind a desk.

1189
01:49:36,222 --> 01:49:39,548
No, really. What, you think I'm kidding?

1190
01:49:42,929 --> 01:49:45,026
- Is anybody hit? - We're good!

1191
01:49:50,103 --> 01:49:51,337
You all right?

1192
01:49:51,337 --> 01:49:52,539
Yeah!

1193
01:49:52,539 --> 01:49:54,074
Is everybody all right?

1194
01:49:54,074 --> 01:49:55,398
Yeah!

1195
01:50:09,122 --> 01:50:10,616
Incoming!

1196
01:50:23,503 --> 01:50:25,737
Keep firing... faster!

1197
01:51:15,889 --> 01:51:18,180
DiTomasso's hit! Pull him out!

1198
01:51:51,357 --> 01:51:53,159
Ranger here. This is Kilo 11.

1199
01:51:53,159 --> 01:51:56,462
Chalk Four. We're at the southeast corner of the crash. Who's this?

1200
01:51:56,462 --> 01:51:58,531
This is Hoot. I'm coming with three friendlies.

1201
01:51:58,531 --> 01:52:00,266
I need cover fire. Over.

1202
01:52:00,266 --> 01:52:03,269
Roger, Kilo 11. Hold your fire! Deltas coming in.

1203
01:52:03,269 --> 01:52:05,594
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

1204
01:52:10,009 --> 01:52:14,939
Ground personnel will have to mark target positions with infrared strobes.

1205
01:52:15,315 --> 01:52:19,185
Get little birds on strafing runs and keep them going all night long.

1206
01:52:19,185 --> 01:52:21,749
If we don't hold back this city...

1207
01:52:22,155 --> 01:52:25,358
...we'll have a 100 caskets to fill by morning.

1208
01:52:25,358 --> 01:52:26,793
Yes, sir.

1209
01:52:26,793 --> 01:52:29,629
Colonel Harrell, ground personnel at crash site one...

1210
01:52:29,629 --> 01:52:34,138
... will have to mark the target with infrared strobes to prep for air strike.

1211
01:52:39,405 --> 01:52:40,933
McKnight.

1212
01:52:44,711 --> 01:52:48,606
Between the 10th Mountain and U.N., we got enough personnel, okay?

1213
01:52:49,649 --> 01:52:52,747
Danny, you guys do not have to go back out again.

1214
01:53:12,605 --> 01:53:15,465
I can't die here, man.

1215
01:53:16,342 --> 01:53:20,738
You're not going to die, all right? You're not going to die.

1216
01:53:21,347 --> 01:53:23,016
I'm sorry.

1217
01:53:23,016 --> 01:53:26,452
You don't have anything to be sorry for.

1218
01:53:26,452 --> 01:53:29,915
You saved Twombly. You did perfect.

1219
01:53:30,823 --> 01:53:32,590
You okay, Twombs?

1220
01:53:32,859 --> 01:53:34,990
Yeah, I'm okay, Jamie.

1221
01:53:36,029 --> 01:53:38,524
You did what you were trained to do.

1222
01:53:39,165 --> 01:53:41,330
You should be proud of that.

1223
01:53:44,137 --> 01:53:45,768
Be proud of that.

1224
01:53:46,306 --> 01:53:48,471
- Ev? - Yeah.

1225
01:53:50,143 --> 01:53:51,774
Do me a favor.

1226
01:53:54,547 --> 01:53:59,784
You tell my parents that I fought well today.

1227
01:54:06,926 --> 01:54:09,091
And that I fought hard.

1228
01:54:10,763 --> 01:54:13,299
You're going to tell them yourself, okay?

1229
01:54:13,299 --> 01:54:14,930
Do you hear me?

1230
01:54:16,436 --> 01:54:17,794
All right?

1231
01:54:19,639 --> 01:54:23,067
- Are the humvees here? - They're coming, Jamie.

1232
01:54:23,276 --> 01:54:25,278
They're coming.

1233
01:54:25,278 --> 01:54:27,613
You just got to hang in there a little bit.

1234
01:54:27,613 --> 01:54:30,283
- You hold on for just a little bit. - I can.

1235
01:54:30,283 --> 01:54:31,743
I can.

1236
01:54:32,819 --> 01:54:34,586
It's nothing.

1237
01:54:35,521 --> 01:54:37,254
It's nothing.

1238
01:54:37,991 --> 01:54:39,192
It's nothing.

1239
01:54:39,192 --> 01:54:41,824
- It's nothing. - It's nothing.

1240
01:54:42,462 --> 01:54:43,922
Nothing.

1241
01:54:51,304 --> 01:54:52,593
Oh, shit.

1242
01:54:53,306 --> 01:54:54,937
Hold the wound.

1243
01:55:21,667 --> 01:55:23,264
Doc.

1244
01:55:25,838 --> 01:55:27,162
Doc.

1245
01:55:43,956 --> 01:55:45,587
It's okay.

1246
01:56:11,918 --> 01:56:13,685
What are you doing?

1247
01:56:16,756 --> 01:56:18,785
We need the ammo.

1248
01:56:26,766 --> 01:56:28,863
You did all you could here.

1249
01:56:29,102 --> 01:56:31,632
They should've sent a medivac.

1250
01:56:31,838 --> 01:56:35,775
Right now we'd be out there defending another crashed chopper.

1251
01:56:35,775 --> 01:56:38,566
More men would get torn up.

1252
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:42,911
Maybe.

1253
01:56:43,116 --> 01:56:46,085
See, you're thinking. Don't.

1254
01:56:46,085 --> 01:56:49,188
Because, Sergeant, you can't control who gets hit or who doesn't.

1255
01:56:49,188 --> 01:56:52,158
Who falls out of a chopper or why.

1256
01:56:52,158 --> 01:56:55,086
It ain't up to you. It's just war.

1257
01:56:56,796 --> 01:56:59,087
Yeah, well, Smith's still dead.

1258
01:57:00,466 --> 01:57:05,238
- This all happened because Blackburn fell. - Should have, could have, don't matter.

1259
01:57:05,238 --> 01:57:09,304
You'll get plenty of time to think about all that later. Believe me.

1260
01:57:12,778 --> 01:57:16,206
Sergeant, you got your men this far.

1261
01:57:16,749 --> 01:57:18,651
You did it right today.

1262
01:57:18,651 --> 01:57:22,409
You need to start thinking about getting these men out of here.

1263
01:57:28,528 --> 01:57:30,728
Well, shall we?

1264
01:57:39,172 --> 01:57:42,566
I need four guys in this corner now!

1265
01:57:48,447 --> 01:57:50,339
RPG!

1266
01:57:53,953 --> 01:57:56,522
This is Barber 52 in position for gun run.

1267
01:57:56,522 --> 01:57:58,949
Jesus Christ. Look at that.

1268
01:57:59,358 --> 01:58:02,562
This is 25! I can see you. You're right above me.

1269
01:58:02,562 --> 01:58:06,065
Eversmann, I can't tell who's who down there. Too much activity.

1270
01:58:06,065 --> 01:58:08,801
I'll mark the target with a strobe! Over.

1271
01:58:08,801 --> 01:58:10,261
Roger that.

1272
01:58:21,747 --> 01:58:23,207
You see it?

1273
01:58:25,251 --> 01:58:27,143
Nah, I can't see shit.

1274
01:58:27,820 --> 01:58:30,756
- I'm putting it on the roof. - You're going to need help!

1275
01:58:30,756 --> 01:58:32,045
Cover me.

1276
01:58:32,959 --> 01:58:36,929
Okay, guys, we're going to lay down some cover fire for him on three!

1277
01:58:36,929 --> 01:58:38,097
Ready?

1278
01:58:38,097 --> 01:58:39,165
One.

1279
01:58:39,165 --> 01:58:40,433
Two.

1280
01:58:40,433 --> 01:58:42,462
Three. Go!

1281
01:59:14,734 --> 01:59:18,470
I got your position. I got the target. We're inbound and hot.

1282
01:59:42,762 --> 01:59:47,600
C- 2, miniguns dry. Request permission to return to base. Rearm. Over.

1283
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:50,603
Roger that. Second team inbound. Your station.

1284
01:59:50,603 --> 01:59:53,098
On your location, four minutes.

1285
02:00:00,946 --> 02:00:04,306
All right, they're here. Get the wounded ready to move.

1286
02:00:04,483 --> 02:00:07,217
Lay down some cover fire!

1287
02:00:09,255 --> 02:00:11,424
I thought I heard a noise out here!

1288
02:00:11,424 --> 02:00:14,454
- Load up. We're getting out of here. - Yes, sir.

1289
02:00:17,330 --> 02:00:22,268
25, this is 64. The rescue column's here and will be with you in about 5 minutes.

1290
02:00:22,268 --> 02:00:24,070
Prepare your men for exfil.

1291
02:00:24,070 --> 02:00:26,861
Yeah, roger that, sir! Roger that!

1292
02:00:27,306 --> 02:00:31,372
Five minutes! The convoy is going to be here in five minutes!

1293
02:00:51,030 --> 02:00:53,466
I need a mag! Eversmann, I'm out!

1294
02:00:53,466 --> 02:00:55,097
My last one!

1295
02:01:04,977 --> 02:01:07,438
The convoy is here!

1296
02:01:25,698 --> 02:01:29,468
Sergeant Eversmann. I heard you guys needed a lift!

1297
02:01:29,468 --> 02:01:31,337
Yes, sir!

1298
02:01:31,337 --> 02:01:34,231
Bring your wounded and start loading them up!

1299
02:01:41,147 --> 02:01:43,482
Hey, I got you. I got you.

1300
02:01:43,482 --> 02:01:46,512
It's okay. I want to walk.

1301
02:01:46,752 --> 02:01:50,112
Yeah, I would too. Let's go!

1302
02:01:58,998 --> 02:02:00,390
Move!

1303
02:02:03,369 --> 02:02:07,002
We get the pilots' bodies out, and then we go to the stadium.

1304
02:02:07,373 --> 02:02:09,241
We're running out of room around here.

1305
02:02:09,241 --> 02:02:11,509
Cram into every possible space.

1306
02:02:12,044 --> 02:02:17,249
Okay, 10th Mountain provides security for armor, walks us out of the hot zone.

1307
02:02:17,249 --> 02:02:18,951
10th Mountain? No.

1308
02:02:18,951 --> 02:02:22,221
Sir, with respect, my Rangers can provide rear security.

1309
02:02:22,221 --> 02:02:26,685
We'll walk you out of the hot zone, then we'll jump on the last few vehicles.

1310
02:02:27,393 --> 02:02:28,727
Okay, let's get out of here.

1311
02:02:28,727 --> 02:02:30,129
Let's go.

1312
02:02:30,129 --> 02:02:32,920
- All right, you got him? - Yeah, come on.

1313
02:02:34,567 --> 02:02:36,232
Come on!

1314
02:02:37,069 --> 02:02:40,139
These things are fucking bullet magnets. Come on, let's go!

1315
02:02:40,139 --> 02:02:42,873
We go when I'm ordered to, soldier.

1316
02:02:45,444 --> 02:02:46,938
Careful.

1317
02:02:47,246 --> 02:02:49,741
Easy. Go easy.

1318
02:02:52,852 --> 02:02:54,517
Easy.

1319
02:03:04,730 --> 02:03:07,032
Colonel, what is going on down there?

1320
02:03:07,032 --> 02:03:10,436
They're dismantling the entire cockpit around the body.

1321
02:03:10,436 --> 02:03:14,399
How long is it going to take? I need an honest, no-shit assessment.

1322
02:03:15,040 --> 02:03:16,705
They can't say!

1323
02:03:18,377 --> 02:03:19,905
Danny...

1324
02:03:21,113 --> 02:03:23,210
...no one gets left behind.

1325
02:03:23,616 --> 02:03:25,747
You understand me, son?

1326
02:03:25,918 --> 02:03:27,685
Yes, General.

1327
02:03:28,053 --> 02:03:29,980
Do what you have to do.

1328
02:03:31,056 --> 02:03:32,618
Roger.

1329
02:03:38,964 --> 02:03:41,494
- Come on. Bring him through. - I got him.

1330
02:03:42,067 --> 02:03:45,530
- Get all his gear. Get the wounded out. - Got you, sir!

1331
02:03:50,843 --> 02:03:52,542
- Move! - Got you!

1332
02:03:52,912 --> 02:03:55,237
Move out! Move out! Let's go!

1333
02:04:05,024 --> 02:04:06,313
Fuck!

1334
02:04:08,861 --> 02:04:10,396
Fire in the hole!

1335
02:04:10,396 --> 02:04:12,527
- Let's go! Move! - Let's go!

1336
02:04:22,775 --> 02:04:26,245
- Open the hatch! We got men back here! - No room here! Go on the roof!

1337
02:04:26,245 --> 02:04:27,413
What's going on?

1338
02:04:27,413 --> 02:04:30,705
- The roof? - I'm not getting on no fucking roof!

1339
02:04:31,383 --> 02:04:33,082
No, no, it's full.

1340
02:04:34,219 --> 02:04:37,784
We're running out. Keep moving. Use the vehicles as cover.

1341
02:04:39,892 --> 02:04:42,251
Move it! Let's go!

1342
02:04:58,877 --> 02:05:01,702
All right, hold it up. Hold it up.

1343
02:05:03,415 --> 02:05:05,017
- Move! - Go! Move!

1344
02:05:05,017 --> 02:05:06,682
Go!

1345
02:06:00,973 --> 02:06:03,707
Get down! Get down!

1346
02:06:04,643 --> 02:06:06,205
Get down, lady!

1347
02:06:08,414 --> 02:06:10,079
I'm out of ammo!

1348
02:06:11,150 --> 02:06:13,441
Sanderson, I'm out of ammo!

1349
02:06:18,157 --> 02:06:20,049
Don't you do it.

1350
02:06:20,359 --> 02:06:23,150
- What are you doing? - Don't you damn do it.

1351
02:06:24,663 --> 02:06:26,328
Kurth, let's go!

1352
02:08:49,875 --> 02:08:51,665
Easy.

1353
02:09:41,260 --> 02:09:43,095
Ah, shit.

1354
02:09:43,095 --> 02:09:47,058
Bullet missed your jugular by about three millimeters. Don't move.

1355
02:09:48,433 --> 02:09:50,758
Hurry up, hurry up.

1356
02:09:53,839 --> 02:09:58,132
Little short on coffee, but I got you some tea.

1357
02:10:02,114 --> 02:10:04,041
How you doing, soldier?

1358
02:10:04,950 --> 02:10:07,115
Can't feel a thing.

1359
02:10:16,895 --> 02:10:18,787
Take his pulse.

1360
02:10:51,830 --> 02:10:53,529
Hey, Sarg'nt.

1361
02:10:57,803 --> 02:10:58,971
Captain.

1362
02:10:58,971 --> 02:11:02,263
Lorenzo. How you doing?

1363
02:11:04,576 --> 02:11:09,581
It went in and out, so the medic said I should be okay in a couple of days.

1364
02:11:09,581 --> 02:11:11,576
That's great news.

1365
02:11:11,883 --> 02:11:13,685
Are we going after them?

1366
02:11:13,685 --> 02:11:16,715
You bet your ass we will. We got to regroup.

1367
02:11:17,990 --> 02:11:20,224
Don't go out there without me.

1368
02:11:20,926 --> 02:11:24,718
Don't go back out there without me.

1369
02:11:25,163 --> 02:11:27,363
I can still do my job.

1370
02:11:28,834 --> 02:11:31,762
You get some rest now, okay?

1371
02:11:46,618 --> 02:11:48,317
You're going back in?

1372
02:11:50,122 --> 02:11:52,253
There are still men out there.

1373
02:11:54,359 --> 02:11:56,217
Goddamn.

1374
02:12:01,099 --> 02:12:02,696
When I go home...

1375
02:12:03,402 --> 02:12:05,070
...and people ask me:

1376
02:12:05,070 --> 02:12:08,703
"Hey, Hoot, why do you do it, man?

1377
02:12:08,974 --> 02:12:13,108
"Why? You some kind of war junkie?"

1378
02:12:13,612 --> 02:12:16,346
I won't say a goddamn word.

1379
02:12:16,381 --> 02:12:17,909
Why?

1380
02:12:18,250 --> 02:12:20,381
They won't understand.

1381
02:12:21,820 --> 02:12:24,418
They won't understand why we do it.

1382
02:12:25,624 --> 02:12:30,054
They won't understand it's about the men next to you.

1383
02:12:31,596 --> 02:12:33,227
And that's it.

1384
02:12:35,100 --> 02:12:36,731
That's all it is.

1385
02:12:46,778 --> 02:12:51,447
Don't even think about it, all right? I'm better on my own.

1386
02:12:56,288 --> 02:12:59,580
We started a whole new week. It's Monday.

1387
02:13:12,137 --> 02:13:14,372
I was talking to Blackburn the other day...

1388
02:13:14,372 --> 02:13:19,371
... and he asked me, "What changed? Why are we going home?"

1389
02:13:20,612 --> 02:13:23,148
And I said, "Nothing."

1390
02:13:23,148 --> 02:13:27,384
But that's not true, you know. I think everything's changed.

1391
02:13:28,487 --> 02:13:30,277
I know I've changed.

1392
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:38,597
A friend of mine asked me before I got here...

1393
02:13:38,597 --> 02:13:40,999
It was when we were all shipping out.

1394
02:13:40,999 --> 02:13:42,789
He asked me:

1395
02:13:43,768 --> 02:13:46,798
"Why are you going to fight somebody else's war?

1396
02:13:47,205 --> 02:13:49,939
"What, do y'all think you're heroes?"

1397
02:13:52,611 --> 02:13:55,311
I didn't know what to say at the time...

1398
02:13:57,949 --> 02:14:00,649
...but if he asked me again, I'd say no.

1399
02:14:02,921 --> 02:14:05,246
I'd say there's no way in hell.

1400
02:14:06,057 --> 02:14:08,382
Nobody asks to be a hero.

1401
02:14:13,431 --> 02:14:15,995
It just sometimes turns out that way.

1402
02:14:19,671 --> 02:14:23,031
I'll talk to your ma and pa when I get home, okay?

1403
02:15:06,318 --> 02:15:10,315
My love, you are strong and you will do well in life.

1404
02:15:11,056 --> 02:15:13,824
I love you and my children deeply.

1405
02:15:14,426 --> 02:15:18,218
Today and tomorrow, let each day grow and grow.

1406
02:15:19,130 --> 02:15:23,594
Keep smiling and never give up, even when things get you down.

1407
02:15:24,603 --> 02:15:27,337
So, in closing, my love...

1408
02:15:27,405 --> 02:15:31,539
... tonight, tuck my children in bed warmly.

1409
02:15:31,676 --> 02:15:36,481
Tell them I love them. Then hug them for me...

1410
02:15:36,481 --> 02:15:39,614
... and give them both a kiss good night for Daddy.
