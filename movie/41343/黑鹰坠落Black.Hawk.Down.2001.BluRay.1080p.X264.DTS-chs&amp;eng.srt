1
00:00:07,277 --> 00:00:14,449
根据真实事件改编

2
00:00:15,985 --> 00:00:21,591
只有死者才能看到战争终结

3
00:00:21,591 --> 00:00:25,588
柏拉图

4
00:00:56,025 --> 00:01:00,421
索马利亚－东非 1992年

5
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:08,494
多年来的部落战争 造成史无前例的饥荒

6
00:01:09,973 --> 00:01:14,437
三十万人死于饥荒

7
00:01:17,413 --> 00:01:21,084
势力最强大的军阀艾迪德

8
00:01:21,084 --> 00:01:23,818
掌控了首都摩加迪休

9
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:29,859
他抢走国际组织运送的粮食

10
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:33,094
利用饥荒做为他的武器

11
00:01:38,901 --> 00:01:42,005
他的恶行引起公愤

12
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:48,733
两万名美国海军陆战队员 协助运送粮食并维持治安

13
00:01:55,785 --> 00:01:57,720
1993年四月

14
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,792
艾迪德一等到美军撤退

15
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:08,029
便立刻向联合国和平部队宣战

16
00:02:13,136 --> 00:02:18,141
艾迪德的民兵在6月 屠杀了24名巴基斯坦士兵

17
00:02:18,141 --> 00:02:21,569
并开始攻击美国人员

18
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:30,153
八月底美军派遣精英部队

19
00:02:30,153 --> 00:02:33,189
陆军反恐怖组织部队 游骑兵部队 及一六○特种作战航空营

20
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:37,016
前往摩加迪休推翻艾迪德政权 重建治安

21
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:44,467
任务原定为3星期结束

22
00:02:44,467 --> 00:02:49,204
但是六星期后华府失去耐心

23
00:02:54,811 --> 00:03:00,777
片名:  黑鹰坠落

24
00:03:02,118 --> 00:03:06,582
星期六-1993年10月2日

25
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,653
红十字会粮食分发中心

26
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,944
那里
There.

27
00:03:36,085 --> 00:03:38,148
九点钟方向有武装车
Technicals, nine o'clock.

28
00:04:03,346 --> 00:04:05,248
该死 你看到吗?
Oh, shit! Did you see that?

29
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:09,552
九点钟方向有平民遭到攻击
Chief, we got unarmed civilians getting shot down here at nine o'clock.

30
00:04:09,552 --> 00:04:13,015
收到了 但我们不能干涉
I got it, Matt. I don't think we can touch this.

31
00:04:15,391 --> 00:04:18,353
这些粮食属于艾迪德
This food is the property of Mohamed Farrah Aidid!

32
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:20,692
快滚回家吧
Go back to your homes!

33
00:04:20,796 --> 00:04:22,231
这是超级64号
Command, Super 64...

34
00:04:22,231 --> 00:04:26,262
民兵在粮食分发中心扫射平民
... we got militia shooting civilians at the food distribution center.

35
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:28,371
请准许攻击
Request permission to engage.

36
00:04:28,371 --> 00:04:31,003
你遭到炮火攻击吗?
Super 64, are you taking fire? Over.

37
00:04:31,274 --> 00:04:32,842
没有
Negative, command.

38
00:04:32,842 --> 00:04:36,579
这是联合国辖区 我们不能干涉
U.N.'s jurisdiction, 64. We cannot intervene.

39
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:38,540
返回基地 收到
- Return to base. Over. - Roger.

40
00:04:38,848 --> 00:04:40,877
64号返回基地
64 returning.

41
00:04:49,325 --> 00:04:54,460
摩加迪休 巴卡拉市集 艾迪德势力范围

42
00:05:28,464 --> 00:05:30,425
可以走了 奥图先生
Ready, Mr. Atto.

43
00:05:41,577 --> 00:05:42,741
他要走了
Leaving.

44
00:06:08,037 --> 00:06:09,304
先生
Sir.

45
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,734
继续开
Keep Driving!

46
00:06:25,554 --> 00:06:27,845
我会迟到
I'm going to be late.

47
00:06:28,057 --> 00:06:30,291
待会再打给你
Call you back.

48
00:06:47,576 --> 00:06:49,378
盖瑞森将军
General Garrison?

49
00:06:49,378 --> 00:06:50,946
谢了 我有了
No, thanks. I got one.

50
00:06:50,946 --> 00:06:53,009
这是古巴雪茄
But these are Cuban.

51
00:06:53,049 --> 00:06:55,249
上好的雪茄
Bolivar Belicoso.

52
00:06:55,384 --> 00:06:56,673
这也是
So is this.

53
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:01,180
迈阿密雪茄没古巴雪茄赞
Miami, my friend, is not Cuba.

54
00:07:08,464 --> 00:07:11,733
你们老是抓不到艾迪德
I see not catching Aidid is becoming a routine.

55
00:07:12,368 --> 00:07:15,371
这次我们要抓的是你
We weren't trying to catch Aidid. We were trying to catch you.

56
00:07:15,371 --> 00:07:16,501
我?
Me?

57
00:07:16,772 --> 00:07:18,972
我有这么重要吗?
But am I that important?

58
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,810
没有吧
I hardly think so.

59
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:24,046
你只是个生意人 只想混口饭吃
- You're just a businessman. - Trying to make a living.

60
00:07:24,046 --> 00:07:27,076
你贩卖枪械给艾迪德的民兵
Yeah. Selling guns to Aidid's militia.

61
00:07:31,821 --> 00:07:33,611
你来了多久?
You've been here, what?

62
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,748
6个星期?
Six weeks?

63
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:41,989
6星期来你一直想抓到他
Six weeks you are trying to catch the general.

64
00:07:42,198 --> 00:07:44,693
到处张帖悬赏海报
You put up reward posters.

65
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,466
两万五千美元 你想演"终结追杀令"吗?
$25,000. What is this? Gunfight at the K.O. Corral?

66
00:07:50,406 --> 00:07:53,698
是"绝命追杀令"
It's the O.K. Corral.

67
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:58,280
你以为把我抓来他就会自首?
Do you think bringing me in will make him suddenly come to you?

68
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,775
乖乖束手就擒?
Make him more agreeable?

69
00:08:03,018 --> 00:08:05,343
你知道他在哪里
You know where he sleeps.

70
00:08:05,654 --> 00:08:09,446
你资助他的一切 包括民兵
You pay for his beds, much less his militia.

71
00:08:10,926 --> 00:08:14,320
我们逮不到他就不走
We're not leaving Somalia till we find him.

72
00:08:15,631 --> 00:08:16,932
我们一定会逮到他
And we will find him.

73
00:08:16,932 --> 00:08:19,635
别以为我从小没自来水喝
Don't think because I grew up without running water...

74
00:08:19,635 --> 00:08:21,926
就是个笨蛋
...I am simple, General.

75
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:25,337
我对历史很了解
I do know something about history.

76
00:08:25,608 --> 00:08:30,345
你看到吗?     我们在创造明天
See all this? It's simply shaping tomorrow.

77
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:34,972
一个没有阿肯色州白小子的明天
A tomorrow without a lot of Arkansas white boys' ideas in it.

78
00:08:35,384 --> 00:08:38,454
我来自德州
Well, I wouldn't know about that. I'm from Texas.

79
00:08:38,454 --> 00:08:42,884
盖将军 你们不该来这儿
Mr. Garrison, I think you shouldn't have come here.

80
00:08:43,192 --> 00:08:45,392
这是内战
This is civil war.

81
00:08:46,061 --> 00:08:48,192
这是我们的战争
This is our war.

82
00:08:48,631 --> 00:08:50,193
不是你们的
Not yours.

83
00:08:51,634 --> 00:08:54,637
三十万人死亡
300,000 dead and counting.

84
00:08:54,637 --> 00:08:58,270
这不是战争 这是种族屠杀
That's not a war, Mr. Atto. That's genocide.

85
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:02,369
喝茶吧
Now, you enjoy that tea, you hear?

86
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,652
你觉得他怎样?
How'd he strike you?

87
00:09:09,652 --> 00:09:12,855
彬彬有礼 冷酷无情
Urbane, sophisticated, cruel.

88
00:09:12,855 --> 00:09:14,918
他是一条大鱼
Yeah, he's a good catch.

89
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,526
时间一久艾迪德就会感到受制
It'll take time, but Aidid will feel the loss.

90
00:09:17,526 --> 00:09:20,463
我们没有太多时间
I'm not sure time is something we got in great supply.

91
00:09:20,463 --> 00:09:24,927
这比伊拉克的情形更复杂
This isn't Iraq, you know. Much more complicated than that.

92
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:27,136
但华府官员可不这么想
Boss, most of Washington might disagree.

93
00:09:27,136 --> 00:09:31,600
他们每天都要我们提出报告
They've been calling for situation reports every morning this week.

94
00:09:32,374 --> 00:09:37,008
你就说战争一触即发
Well, tell them the situation is fragile.

95
00:09:39,582 --> 00:09:43,452

本班机的机长
I'll be your pilot today.

98
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:51,961

Federal regulations designate this a non-smoking Black Hawk helicopter.

And as always, the air sickness bags are in the seatback in front of you.

101

一号引擎正常 检查二号引擎
Number one indications are good, Cliff. Put her on two.

102
00:10:05,207 --> 00:10:06,735
没问题
You're still clear.

103
00:10:21,657 --> 00:10:25,160
这是64号 使用高频无线电
61, this is 64. Go to UHF secure.

104
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,620
我有坏消息
I've got some bad news.

105
00:10:27,496 --> 00:10:30,499
礼车是一个字 别跟我罗唆
"Limo" is a word, Durant. I don't want to hear about it.

106
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:33,369
那是缩写 不是一个字
It is not a word. It's an abbreviation of a word.

107
00:10:33,369 --> 00:10:35,504
那是常用语
"Limo" is a word in common usage.

108
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:39,375
拼字游戏的规则接受常用语
That is the key phrase in Scrabble, my good friend. Common usage.

109
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:42,444
字典查不到就不算
If it's not in the dictionary it doesn't count!

110
00:10:42,444 --> 00:10:44,613
字典查不到也算
It doesn't have to be in the dictionary!

111
00:10:44,613 --> 00:10:46,882
字典查不到就不算
It does have to be in the dictionary!

112
00:10:46,882 --> 00:10:50,481
等我回基地就把这个字剔除
When we get back to the base, it's coming off.

113
00:10:51,086 --> 00:10:54,184
你敢我就扁你 听到吗?
You touch my "limo" and I'll spank you, Nightstalker.

114
00:10:54,523 --> 00:10:56,381
你有种扁我才怪
Yeah, promises.

115
00:10:56,825 --> 00:10:58,888
好美的海滩
That's a nice beach down there.

116
00:10:59,361 --> 00:11:00,650

How's the water?

117
00:11:00,863 --> 00:11:05,031
很暖和 到处都是鲨鱼

Firstly, it's "the Mog" or simply "Mog." No one calls it Mogadishu here.

125
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,261
我没有打仗 别问我
Secondly, I wouldn't know about the fighting, so don't ask.

126
00:11:35,564 --> 00:11:36,853
为什么?
Why not?

127
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:38,958
我叫你别问我
Didn't I just say, "Don't ask"?

128
00:11:41,136 --> 00:11:44,940
你像个小孩 我解释给你听
You look like you're about 12, so let me explain something to you.

我有一种特殊才能 不必打仗

00:13:10,292 --> 00:13:11,581
什么事?
Yeah?

144
00:13:11,894 --> 00:13:13,252
我来报到
Reporting for duty.

145
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:18,133
你要向毕中尉报到 他应该就在附近
Not to me. You're reporting to It. Beales. He should be here somewhere.

146
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:19,559
我把他交给你
Can I leave him with you?

147
00:13:20,302 --> 00:13:22,593
好吧
Yeah, go ahead.

148
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:24,871
你把枪带来了 是 长官
- You brought your weapon. - Yes, sir.

149
00:13:24,907 --> 00:13:27,004
我不累 我能练靶吗?
Want me to shoot? I'm rested.

150
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:30,243
你几时到? 刚才
- When did you get in? - Just now, Sergeant.

151
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,276
谁饿了?
Hey, who's hungry?

152
00:13:58,507 --> 00:14:02,111
这算什么? 纳税人出钱的狩猎大餐吗?
What is this, Sarg'nt? Another taxpayer-funded Delta safari?

153
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:05,403
盖将军问起可别说 我问起呢?
- Not if General Garrison is asking. - I'm asking.

154
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:07,805
用餐愉快 上尉
Have a nice meal, Captain.

155
00:14:12,354 --> 00:14:14,918
大家都在排队 我知道
- Hey, man, there's a line. - I know.

156
00:14:15,057 --> 00:14:18,758
你这是插队 我也知道
- Well, this isn't the back of it. - Yeah, I know.

157
00:14:19,795 --> 00:14:22,290
中士
Sergeant. Sergeant.

158
00:14:22,698 --> 00:14:23,966
这干嘛?
What's going on here?

159
00:14:23,966 --> 00:14:27,069
我们在练靶 打到一只野猪
Some aerial target practice, sir. Didn't want to leave it behind.

160
00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:29,338
我是说你的步枪
I'm talking about your weapon.

161
00:14:29,338 --> 00:14:32,107
反恐怖部队也不能 拿上膛的步枪到处晃
Delta or no Delta, that's a hot weapon.

162
00:14:32,107 --> 00:14:35,477
你应该很清楚 枪要随时上保险
You know better than that. Safety should be on at all times on base.

163
00:14:35,477 --> 00:14:38,143
这就是我的"保险"
Well, this is my safety, sir.

164
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:43,685
别管他 他两天没吃饭了
Let it go, sir. The guy hasn't eaten in a couple of days.

165
00:14:43,685 --> 00:14:46,818
反恐怖部队都是一群蛮牛
You Delta boys are a bunch of undisciplined cowboys.

166
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:49,424
让我告诉你
Let me tell you something, Sarg'nt.

167
00:14:49,424 --> 00:14:53,262
到了前线你需要游骑兵支援
When we get on a five-yard line, you're going to need my Rangers.

168
00:14:53,262 --> 00:14:55,621
你最好有点团队精神
Y'all better learn to be team players.

169
00:14:57,099 --> 00:14:58,889
我说完了
We're done here.

170
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,880
说呀 你说这是保险
Speak up. You say this is your safety?

171
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,011
这是我的靴子
Well, this is my boot, son.

172
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:18,187
小心我用这只靴子把你踢爆
And it will fit up your ass with the proper amount of force.

173
00:15:18,187 --> 00:15:22,024
这算新泽西口音吗? 拜托 我很努力耶
- Is that a Jersey accent? - I'm trying to do this, give me a break.

174
00:15:22,024 --> 00:15:24,026
把太阳眼镜脱掉
Take those sunglasses off.

175
00:15:24,026 --> 00:15:26,428
反恐怖部队爱戴名牌墨镜 那是他们的事
Delta wants to wear Oakleys, that's their business.

176
00:15:26,428 --> 00:15:28,958
别让我再看到你戴
I don't want to see them on you again.

177
00:15:30,432 --> 00:15:32,427
那是一把上膛的步枪?
Is that a hot weapon?

178
00:15:37,472 --> 00:15:39,007
你下了吗?
Is that your move?

179
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,172
手还没离棋啊?
Is my hand on the piece?

180
00:15:41,276 --> 00:15:43,976
再下三步我就赢了
I can mate you in three whatever you do.

181
00:15:45,147 --> 00:15:48,746
你自己最好小心点
I'd keep my eye on that queen before counseling others.

182
00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:51,352
有种就放马过来
Well, she's just lying in wait.

183
00:15:54,957 --> 00:15:56,246
唉
Yikes.

184
00:15:58,193 --> 00:16:01,485
你画得越来越好了
It's good. You're really improving.

185
00:16:01,697 --> 00:16:04,499
不过我有一个建议
If I may make a suggestion... Observation.

186
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:05,734
说吧
Go ahead.

187
00:16:05,734 --> 00:16:08,366
这是童话故事 对吧? 没错
- It's a children's book, right? - Right.

188
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:12,941
这会把小孩子吓得屁滚尿流
They are not supposed to scare the living shit out of the children.

189
00:16:12,941 --> 00:16:16,778
骑士正要屠龙
This is the part of the story where our knight is slaying the dragon.

190
00:16:16,778 --> 00:16:19,514
本来就很可怕 而且我女儿最喜欢了
That's scary. Besides, my daughter loves this stuff.

191
00:16:19,514 --> 00:16:21,805
我以为你上礼拜就画完了
Thought you finished that last week.

192
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,712
你说完了吗?
You done?

193
00:16:24,987 --> 00:16:28,657
就快冲到十码线了
Hey, we are at the 10-yard line here, men.

194
00:16:28,657 --> 00:16:30,447
明白吗?
You understand?

195
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:33,450
你会数吗?1 2 3
Can you count? One, two, ten.

196
00:16:33,662 --> 00:16:36,031
我的后卫呢?
Okay? Where are my running backs?

197
00:16:36,031 --> 00:16:38,128
我的后卫呢?
Where are my running backs?

198
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:42,671
我没看到你做礼拜
Hey, I didn't see you at church on Sunday.

199
00:16:42,671 --> 00:16:44,806
你有别的事吗?
You had something more important to do?

200
00:16:44,806 --> 00:16:47,309
礼拜天一定要做礼拜
Not on Sunday, you don't. Not anymore.

201
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:49,907
别给我落跑 了解吗?
I will make you believe, you understand?

202
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,559
很好笑 呼吓
Pretty funny, hoo-ah?

203
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:13,125
你学得很像 很像我
It was a good impression. I recognize myself.

204
00:17:15,304 --> 00:17:17,401
继续吧
All right, carry on.

205
00:17:17,806 --> 00:17:20,939
我要跟你讲话 是 长官
- I'd like a word, specialist. - Sir.

206
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,980
你知道谁有指挥权吧?
You understand why we have a chain of command, don't you?

207
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,948
知道 长官
Roger that, sir.

208
00:17:25,948 --> 00:17:29,518
你敢再取笑我 我就命令你把马桶舔干净
If you ever undermine me again, you'll clean latrines with your tongue...

209
00:17:29,518 --> 00:17:32,621
保证你一个月吃不下饭
...till you taste no difference between shit and French fries.

210
00:17:32,621 --> 00:17:33,822
明白吗? 明白 长官
- Are we clear? - Hoo-ah, sir.

211
00:17:33,822 --> 00:17:35,054
好吧
All right.

212
00:17:42,631 --> 00:17:43,732
听好:
Listen to this:

213
00:17:43,732 --> 00:17:48,799
当一个索马利亚人杀了人 他的部落就欠对方部落一百只骆驼
If one skinny kills another his clan owes the dead guy's clan a hundred camels.

214
00:17:48,837 --> 00:17:50,272
一百只骆驼
A hundred camels.

215
00:17:50,272 --> 00:17:52,802
我连一只都不给
Camels. I wouldn't pay one camel.

216
00:17:53,008 --> 00:17:55,242
这儿的骆驼欠债一定很多
Must be a lot of fucking camel debt.

217
00:17:55,777 --> 00:17:57,846
这是真的吗?
Is that really true, Lieutenant?

218
00:17:57,846 --> 00:18:00,171
去问艾士官 他喜欢非洲人
Ask Sgt. Eversmann. He likes skinnies.

219
00:18:00,315 --> 00:18:03,243
艾士官 那是真的吗?
Sgt. Eversmann, you really like the skinnies?

220
00:18:03,385 --> 00:18:07,289
不是喜欢不喜欢的问题 我尊敬他们
It's not that I like them or I don't like them. I respect them.

221
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:11,753
你们要知道艾士官很有理想
See, what you guys fail to realize is the sergeant is a bit of an idealist.

222
00:18:12,094 --> 00:18:15,731
他相信这项任务的使命 对吧 士官?
He believes in this mission down to his bones. Don't you, Sergeant?

223
00:18:15,731 --> 00:18:19,234
这些人没有工作
Look, these people, they have no jobs...

224
00:18:19,234 --> 00:18:23,405
没有食物 教育和未来
...no food, no education, no future.

225
00:18:23,405 --> 00:18:27,075
我只是觉得我们有两个选择
I just figure that, I mean, we have two things that we can do.

226
00:18:27,075 --> 00:18:28,677
帮助他们
We can help...

227
00:18:28,677 --> 00:18:32,180
或是眼睁睁看着他们自相残杀
...or we can sit back and watch the country destroy itself on CNN.

228
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,469
对吧?
Right?

229
00:18:33,515 --> 00:18:36,685
我不知道 我是来打仗的
I don't know about you guys, but I was trained to fight.

230
00:18:36,685 --> 00:18:38,820
你不是吗?
Are you trained to fight, Sergeant?

231
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,918
我是来改善世界的
Well, I think I was trained to make a difference, Kurth.

232
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,457
他真的很有理想
Like the man said, he's an idealist.

233
00:18:46,928 --> 00:18:49,287
等等 我最爱这一段
Oh, wait. This is my favorite part.

234
00:18:54,536 --> 00:18:56,638
滚远一点
Stay away from the cans!

235
00:18:56,638 --> 00:18:59,304
去死吧 猪头
Die, gas-pumper!

236
00:18:59,674 --> 00:19:01,771
给我滚远一点
Stay away from those cans!

237
00:19:06,381 --> 00:19:08,583
不 退后
No, no, stay back.

238
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,653
他的癫痫症发作了 拿东西让他咬着
He's having a seizure. Put something in his mouth.

239
00:19:11,653 --> 00:19:16,890
约翰 没事了…没事了…
John, it's okay. John, it's okay. It's okay.

240
00:19:18,326 --> 00:19:25,862
清晨5： 45 10月3日星期天

241
00:20:02,971 --> 00:20:06,104
他没事了 不过他得退伍
Well, he'll be fine. But not in this army.

242
00:20:06,808 --> 00:20:09,770
他有癫痫症 我要送他回家
He's out of the game. He's epileptic, going home.

243
00:20:13,982 --> 00:20:16,910
我要你当小队长
I'm putting you in charge of his chalk.

244
00:20:17,052 --> 00:20:19,955
你有意见吗? 没有 长官
- You got a problem with that? - No, sir.

245
00:20:19,955 --> 00:20:22,124
这个责任很重大
It's a big responsibility.

246
00:20:22,124 --> 00:20:24,759
你的弟兄都仰赖你
Your men will look to you to make the right decisions.

247
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:27,118
他们的命都在你手上
Their lives depend on it.

248
00:20:27,896 --> 00:20:29,424
好了
All right.

249
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:32,968
游骑兵做先锋 勇往直前
- Rangers lead the way, sir. - All the way.

250
00:20:32,968 --> 00:20:34,701
祝好运
Good luck.

00:22:36,725 --> 00:22:38,293
一起上悍马车队
...load up on humvees...

277
00:22:38,293 --> 00:22:42,461
地面部队就一路赶回基地
...and the entire ground force will exfil the 3 miles back to base.

278
00:22:42,464 --> 00:22:45,995
行动时间只有半小时
Mission time, no longer than 30 minutes.

279
00:22:46,801 --> 00:22:51,840
我请求调动装甲车 和AC-130炮艇机支援
Now, I had requested light armor and AC-130 Spectre gunships...

280
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,111
但华府却不同意
...but Washington, in all its wisdom, decided against this.

281
00:22:56,111 --> 00:22:58,179
太显眼了
Too high-profile.

282
00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:01,583
准备多管机枪的 黑鹰直升机
So Black Hawks and Little Birds will provide the air cover...

283
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:04,019
将提供空中支援
...with miniguns and 2.75 rockets.

284
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:05,587
哈上校
Colonel Harrell.

285
00:23:05,587 --> 00:23:10,221
马上校负责调派空中支援
In the C-2 bird, Colonel Matthews will coordinate the air mission...

286
00:23:10,425 --> 00:23:13,558
我负责指挥地面部队
...and I will coordinate ground forces.

287
00:23:13,595 --> 00:23:14,963
马上校
Colonel Matthews.

288
00:23:14,963 --> 00:23:18,562
任务执行代号是艾琳
Mission launch code word is Irene.

289
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:20,022
有问题吗?
Questions?

290
00:23:22,971 --> 00:23:24,602
目标是哪栋建筑?
Which building is it, sir?

291
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:28,734
巴卡拉市集附近的建筑物
We're confirming that now. Somewhere near the Bakara market.

292
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:34,249
我不能决定他们在哪里开会
I don't choose the time or place of their meetings.

293
00:23:34,249 --> 00:23:36,346
我没这么说
I didn't say a word, sir.

294
00:23:36,351 --> 00:23:39,821
大家听好 你们到了市集
Make no mistake, once you're in the Bakara market...

295
00:23:39,821 --> 00:23:42,521
就等于进入敌区
...you're in an entirely hostile district.

296
00:23:42,757 --> 00:23:45,360
千万别低估敌人实力
Don't underestimate their capabilities.

297
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,097
进入市集之前都不是敌区
We'll be in friendly neighborhoods before we hit the market...

298
00:23:49,097 --> 00:23:53,968
千万切记交战法则 遭到攻击才能反击
...so remember the rules of engagement: No one fires unless fired upon.

299
00:23:53,968 --> 00:23:56,532
完成任务吧
Now, let's go get this thing done.

300
00:23:57,339 --> 00:23:59,266
祝好运 各位
Good luck, gentlemen.

301
00:24:03,912 --> 00:24:07,048
怎么了?你不满意吗?
What's the matter, Danny? Something you don't like?

302
00:24:07,048 --> 00:24:09,417
没有C－炮艇机 白天出任务
No Spectre gunships, daylight instead of night...

303
00:24:09,417 --> 00:24:12,087
敌人的精神在下午特别亢奋
...afternoon when they're all fucked up on khat...

304
00:24:12,087 --> 00:24:16,551
那儿又是火力集中的敌区
...only part of the city Aidid can mount a counter-attack on short notice...

305
00:24:16,624 --> 00:24:19,728
我有什么不满意的? 人生不如意十有八九
- What's not to like? - Life's imperfect.

306
00:24:19,728 --> 00:24:23,698
你们在半空中只是不如意
For you two, circling above it at 500 feet, it's imperfect.

307
00:24:23,698 --> 00:24:27,661
我们在地面就苦不堪言
Down in the street, it's unforgiving.

308
00:25:03,538 --> 00:25:05,135
搞什么?
What the fuck, Smith?

309
00:25:05,807 --> 00:25:07,876
怎样? 什么怎样?
- Well? - Well, what?

310
00:25:07,876 --> 00:25:09,643
我们要行动吗?
We going?

311
00:25:10,712 --> 00:25:14,778
我干嘛告诉你 你就是要说
- Why should I tell you that? - Because I'm me.

312
00:25:15,817 --> 00:25:19,721
对 下午三点 市中心
Yeah. 3:00. Downtown.

313
00:25:19,721 --> 00:25:21,489
巴卡拉市集 好耶
- Bakara market. - All right.

314
00:25:21,489 --> 00:25:25,527
小史 我要你全力支持我
Listen, Smith, I need you to back me up out there today, all right?

315
00:25:25,527 --> 00:25:27,021
提高警觉
Keep sharp.

316
00:25:29,397 --> 00:25:31,733
遵命 艾士官
Yes, sir, Sergeant Eversmann.

317
00:25:31,733 --> 00:25:34,399
这次行动是小意思啦
Ev, it's going to be nothing, man.

318
00:25:34,736 --> 00:25:36,333
小意思
Nothing.

319
00:25:38,907 --> 00:25:44,543
关键是磨咖啡豆 不能磨得太细或太粗
It's all in the grind, Sizemore. Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.

320
00:25:44,846 --> 00:25:47,341
这是一种技巧
This, my friend, is a science.

321
00:25:47,916 --> 00:25:50,952
我可是相信徵兵广告的那种人
You're looking at the guy that believed the commercials.

322
00:25:50,952 --> 00:25:53,288
尽忠报国
About "be all you can be."

323
00:25:53,288 --> 00:25:56,386
但是我在波湾战争都在煮咖啡
I made coffee through Desert Storm.

324
00:25:56,391 --> 00:25:59,794
在巴拿马也煮咖啡 别的游骑兵队员
I made coffee through Panama, while everyone else got to fight...

325
00:25:59,794 --> 00:26:01,925
都出生入死
...got to be a Ranger.

326
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:07,465
我却只能煮黑咖啡 替别人拿奶精
Now it's "Grimesy, black, one sugar" or "Grimesy, got a powdered anywhere?"

327
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,830
怎么了? 乒乓球受伤
- What happened to you? - Ping-Pong accident.

328
00:26:13,908 --> 00:26:15,197
什么?
What?

329
00:26:15,877 --> 00:26:17,542
猜怎么着?
So guess what.

330
00:26:17,846 --> 00:26:20,849
你的愿望实现了 你要出任务
Your wish has been granted. You're going out today.

331
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:22,717
少唬烂我
You're fucking me.

332
00:26:22,717 --> 00:26:25,386
你要代替我负责 有装备枪榴弹的M－步枪
You're taking my place assisting the 60 gunner.

333
00:26:25,386 --> 00:26:28,849
艾士官叫你收拾好装备
Sergeant Eversmann said to get your stuff and get ready.

334
00:26:29,724 --> 00:26:31,860
你想要打仗 不是吗?
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

335
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,491
是啊
Oh, yeah.

336
00:26:34,996 --> 00:26:36,264
当然了
Hell, yeah.

337
00:26:36,264 --> 00:26:40,001
葛姆 跟着瓦德给他弹药
Grimesy, stick with Waddell and give him ammo when he needs it.

338
00:26:40,001 --> 00:26:41,402
呼吓? 呼吓
- Hoo-ah? - Hoo-ah.

339
00:26:41,402 --> 00:26:46,107
别担心 索利亚人的枪法都很烂
I wouldn't worry about that. Generally speaking, Somalis can't shoot for shit.

340
00:26:46,107 --> 00:26:50,245
小心别被他们的石头K到就行
Just watch out for the sammys throwing the rocks, and you'll be fine.

341
00:26:50,245 --> 00:26:51,446
会好玩的
Might even be fun.

342
00:26:51,446 --> 00:26:55,416
让反恐怖部队打头阵 我们只要支援他们
D-boys do their thing now. All we got to do is cover them.

343
00:26:55,416 --> 00:26:58,617
直升机也会掩护我们
Choppers going to cover us, and we'll be all right.

344
00:26:59,187 --> 00:27:03,291
我知道我是第一次当小队长
Look, you guys, this is my first time as chalk leader...

345
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:06,861
但我们不是第一次出任务
...but, this isn't our first time out together. This is serious.

346
00:27:06,861 --> 00:27:10,597
我们是游骑兵 不是预备军官
We're Rangers, not some sorry-ass JROTC.

347
00:27:10,865 --> 00:27:12,427
我们是精英部队
We're elite.

348
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:15,261
大家要好好表现
Let's act like it out there. Hoo-ah?

349
00:27:16,104 --> 00:27:18,099
有问题吗?
Any questions?

350
00:27:24,212 --> 00:27:26,173
我们不会有事的
We're going to be okay.

351
00:27:26,714 --> 00:27:28,845
收拾好装备 出动吧
Grab your gear. Let's move out.

352
00:27:48,903 --> 00:27:53,196
你不需要水壶 很快就会回来
You're not going to need that, dude. We're not out there long enough.

353
00:28:00,882 --> 00:28:02,581
那也用不着
You won't need that, either.

354
00:28:02,817 --> 00:28:04,953
天黑前就会回来
We'll be back before dark.

355
00:28:04,953 --> 00:28:07,689
你不如多带大麻和啤酒
You might as well take dope and beer instead.

356
00:28:07,689 --> 00:28:09,190
什么?
What?

357
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,424
弹药啦 多带弹药啦
Ammo, dude. Take ammo.

358
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:22,236
你身上有五十磅的装备
Let me tell you something, Grimes. You got 50 pounds of gear.

359
00:28:22,236 --> 00:28:23,471
不必多加十二磅
You don't need another 12.

360
00:28:23,471 --> 00:28:27,976
背这么重想逃命都逃不了
I don't know about you, I don't plan on getting shot running away.

361
00:28:27,976 --> 00:28:29,711
我还是要穿防弹背心
Well, I better keep mine in.

362
00:28:29,711 --> 00:28:30,812
葛姆
Grimes.

363
00:28:30,812 --> 00:28:32,981
最重要的是
Most important thing:

364
00:28:32,981 --> 00:28:36,546
跟着大家射击的方向开枪
Remember, when everyone is shooting, shoot in the same direction.

365
00:28:44,525 --> 00:28:48,396
你看 他在靴子帖上血型
Look at this. He's taping his blood type to his boots.

366
00:28:48,396 --> 00:28:52,223
触霉头 很聪明
- That's bad luck. - No, it's smart.

367
00:28:52,233 --> 00:28:54,330
反恐怖部队都这么做
All Delta do that.

368
00:28:54,836 --> 00:28:57,127
写遗书也很倒霉
That's bad luck too, man.

369
00:28:57,338 --> 00:28:58,764
快走吧
Come on, let's go.

370
00:29:02,043 --> 00:29:05,176
幸好你不是左撇子
It's a good thing you're right-handed, Adonis.

371
00:29:07,015 --> 00:29:11,513
要不然你就没搞头了 你真会说笑
- If not, I don't know what you'd do. - You're a funny guy, man.

372
00:29:12,854 --> 00:29:15,952
我不替你拿遗书 我们说好的
- I'm not taking no death letter. - We have a deal.

373
00:29:18,459 --> 00:29:20,695
一小时后还给你
I'll give it to you back in an hour.

374
00:29:20,695 --> 00:29:25,193
贝克朋 你还好吧? 我很兴奋
- Blackburn, you okay? - Excited.

375
00:29:26,367 --> 00:29:30,159
这是好事我当兵就是为了打仗
In a good way. I've been training my whole life for this.

376
00:29:30,238 --> 00:29:32,563
你杀过人吗?
You ever shot at anybody before?

377
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,129
没有
No, sir.

378
00:29:35,443 --> 00:29:36,971
我也没有
Me neither.

379
00:29:39,914 --> 00:29:43,081
下午2点29分

380
00:30:10,912 --> 00:30:12,447
他可靠吗?
Think he's reliable?

381
00:30:12,447 --> 00:30:16,217
等着瞧吧 他第一次出任务
Well, we'll see. It's his first time out.

382
00:30:16,217 --> 00:30:18,576
联合行动指挥中心

383
00:30:24,058 --> 00:30:26,594
叫他把收音机关掉 是 长官
- Tell him to turn his damn radio off. - Yes, sir.

384
00:30:26,594 --> 00:30:28,496
叫他把收音机关掉
Tell him to turn his radio off.

385
00:30:28,496 --> 00:30:31,788
阿弟 把收音机关掉
Abdi, you need to turn your radio off.

386
00:30:37,805 --> 00:30:42,769
这是史黛芬和蓝迪 请留言 谢谢
Hi. You've reached Stephanie and Randy, leave us a message. Thank you.

387
00:30:44,812 --> 00:30:47,546
老婆 是我 你在吗?
Hey, baby, it's me. Are you there?

388
00:30:48,816 --> 00:30:51,107
你在的话就快接
Pick up if you're there.

389
00:30:51,686 --> 00:30:54,955
我只是打来看你好不好
I'm just calling to make sure everything's all right.

390
00:30:55,256 --> 00:30:57,990
过两小时再打给你
I'll call you in a couple hours.

391
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,960
你最好别睡着了
You'd better not be sleeping.

392
00:31:01,662 --> 00:31:03,259
该你了 蓝迪
Your move, Randy.

393
00:31:04,699 --> 00:31:06,523
我好想你
I'm missing you.

394
00:31:07,268 --> 00:31:09,331
我爱你
I love you, baby.

395
00:31:10,471 --> 00:31:12,102
喂?
Hello? Hello?

396
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:15,569
谢了
Thanks, bud.

397
00:31:17,645 --> 00:31:19,845
这有点好笑
You know, it's kind of funny.

398
00:31:20,148 --> 00:31:23,576
洁白的沙滩 灿烂的阳光
Beautiful beach, beautiful sun.

399
00:31:24,619 --> 00:31:27,054
几乎是一个好地方
Could almost be a good place to visit.

400
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:28,753
几乎
Almost.

401
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:34,486
你认为我们不该来
You don't think we should be here.

402
00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:39,889
你知道我怎么想吗? 我怎么想不重要
You know what I think? It don't really matter what I think.

403
00:31:40,935 --> 00:31:45,473
第一颗子弹从你头上呼啸而过
Once that first bullet goes past your head, politics and all that shit...

404
00:31:45,473 --> 00:31:47,900
那些狗屁倒灶的事都不重要
...just goes right out the window.

405
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:50,703
我只想完成任务
I just want to do it right today.

406
00:31:51,045 --> 00:31:55,179
打起精神 让弟兄活着回来
Just watch your corner. Get all your men back here alive.

407
00:32:20,107 --> 00:32:24,145
就是这里还是汽车抛锚?
Now, is this supposed to be the place, or did his car just take a dump?

408
00:32:24,145 --> 00:32:25,878
阿弟 请回答
Abdi, come in.

409
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,848
你听到吗?这是目标吗?
Abdi, can you hear me? Is this the place?

410
00:32:32,887 --> 00:32:34,381

412
00:32:42,763 --> 00:32:45,967
请回答 是这里吗?
Abdi, come in. Is this the place?

413
00:32:45,967 --> 00:32:48,735
我右手边 咖啡厅楼上
To my right side, above the cafe.

414
00:32:48,803 --> 00:32:51,305
他说就是这里
He says this is the building.

415
00:32:51,305 --> 00:32:53,038
他确定?
He's certain?

416
00:32:53,341 --> 00:32:55,409
阿弟 你要确定才行
Abdi, you need to be sure.

417
00:32:55,409 --> 00:32:57,074
你确定?
Are you sure?

418
00:32:58,446 --> 00:33:03,080
目标在我左边两条街口外
Well, it's down the road, two blocks over on my left.

419
00:33:03,718 --> 00:33:05,918
不过民兵太多了
But there's too many militia.

420
00:33:06,187 --> 00:33:08,819
我一靠近他们就会开枪
If I go closer, they might shoot me.

421
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:12,226
他说目标在两个街口外
Now he's saying the building's a couple blocks down...

422
00:33:12,226 --> 00:33:14,892
不过他怕对方会向他开枪
...but if he's seen outside it, he'll be shot.

423
00:33:15,396 --> 00:33:17,765
我才会宰了他
I'll fucking shoot him myself.

424
00:33:17,765 --> 00:33:21,369
叫他把车子停在目标门口

他不去就拿不到钱

离目标三哩 不要走小路
Three miles to the target. We're never off the main roads.

At K-four traffic circle, we turn north, then east on National...

428

然后全队开进

430
00:33:36,584 --> 00:33:40,411
把人犯跟地面部队载回来

432
00:33:43,224 --> 00:33:46,594
敌人会反击 那儿就像西部电影一样
There will be some shooting. Bakara market is the Wild West.

433
00:33:46,594 --> 00:33:50,159
小心开枪 那儿有平民
But be careful what you shoot at. People do live there.

434
00:33:50,464 --> 00:33:52,026
呼吓
Hoo-ah.

435
00:34:03,678 --> 00:34:08,176
上一个线民玩俄罗斯轮盘搁屁了
Last one of these guys shot himself in the head playing Russian roulette.

436
00:34:21,562 --> 00:34:24,160

Sir, the vehicle is stopped.

437
00:34:24,665 --> 00:34:28,366
这就是目标 他确定吗?
So this is the real deal now. He's sure this time.

438
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:33,466
他吓得屁滚尿流 好 好现象
- He sounds scared shitless. - Good. That's always a good sign.

439
00:34:44,585 --> 00:34:46,921
这就是我们的信号
That's it. That's our signal.

440
00:34:46,921 --> 00:34:48,552
好
All right.

441
00:34:48,756 --> 00:34:51,820

决不抛弃同胞
No one gets left behind.

452
00:35:50,818 --> 00:35:52,449
怎么了?
What's wrong?

453
00:35:52,987 --> 00:35:56,450
他从没来道过别
Nothing. He's just never done that before.

454
00:35:57,158 --> 00:35:58,925

01:15:04,157 --> 01:15:05,959
我是友军
Friendlies coming through!

826
01:15:05,959 --> 01:15:08,562
走吧 快走
Let's go, let's go! Move up!

827
01:15:08,562 --> 01:15:10,762

829
01:15:19,673 --> 01:15:21,668
快走…快…
Move up! Go! Move up!

830
01:15:21,775 --> 01:15:23,577
你在干什么?
What the fuck are you doing out there?

831
01:15:23,577 --> 01:15:26,573
我们要赶到坠机地点
Doing my job! We got to get to that crash site!

832
01:15:26,613 --> 01:15:29,711
我们一定要赶到那条街
We got to get on that street, and we got to move!

833
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:32,118
你也要跟上来
And you have got to keep up, sir!

834
01:15:32,118 --> 01:15:34,354
别对我下令 中士
Don't you ever give me orders, Sergeant.

835
01:15:34,354 --> 01:15:37,122
我们没办法迎敌
We are combat ineffective, understand?

836
01:15:37,424 --> 01:15:39,025
太多伤兵了
We got too many wounded to move!

837
01:15:39,025 --> 01:15:42,556
让我带人手绕到坠机地点
Then give me some shooters and I'll circle us to the bird.

838
01:15:44,965 --> 01:15:47,634
葛姆 你在第四小队吗?
Grimes! You're with Chalk Four?

839
01:15:47,634 --> 01:15:48,869
是的 长官
Yes, sir!

840
01:15:48,869 --> 01:15:52,605
去跟反恐怖部队和艾中士会合
All right, hook up with Delta! Rejoin with Sergeant Eversmann.

841
01:15:52,873 --> 01:15:55,342
其他的人留守这里
The rest of you, secure this position!

842
01:15:55,342 --> 01:15:57,644
照顾伤兵 等待车队
Treat the wounded, we'll wait for the convoy!

843
01:15:57,644 --> 01:16:00,380
然后在坠机地点会合
Then we'll rally at the crash site. Roger!

844
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:02,045
我的手下跟我走
My guys, let's go!

845
01:16:32,679 --> 01:16:35,749
两名反恐怖部队狙击手 舒哈和葛顿
C- 2, I have two Delta snipers, Shughart and Gordon...

846
01:16:35,749 --> 01:16:38,745
自愿前往第二坠机地点
...volunteering to secure crash site two. Over.

847
01:16:39,085 --> 01:16:43,549
不准 不能再牺牲另一架直升机
No, Super 62, negative that request. Can't risk another bird.

848
01:16:45,091 --> 01:16:49,327
我们不能确定有人生还
We don't see anything moving down there, we don't even know if anyone's alive.

849
01:16:50,297 --> 01:16:53,199
地面部队正在赶去
A ground team is being organized to go in now.

850
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:55,101
多久能赶到?
ETA on ground team? Over.

851
01:16:55,101 --> 01:16:58,371
不知道 不久吧
Unknown, not long.

852
01:16:58,371 --> 01:17:01,003
你们尽力从空中协助
Do what you can from the air.

853

大家过来
All right, gather around!

854
01:17:06,613 --> 01:17:09,916
杜伦坠毁了 我们要去救他
Durant's 64 is down. We're going back in to get him!

855
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:12,118
你疯了 有人生还吗?
That's crazy. Is there anyone alive?

856
01:17:12,118 --> 01:17:14,754
无所谓 绝不能抛弃同胞
Doesn't matter, no one gets left behind.

857
01:17:14,754 --> 01:17:17,123
这是浪费时间
We're wasting time here.

858
01:17:17,123 --> 01:17:20,449
五分钟内重新整理弹药
Refit and max out ammo and grenades, you got five!

859
01:17:21,394 --> 01:17:23,296
塞斯莫 你想去哪儿?
Sizemore, where are you going?

860
01:17:23,296 --> 01:17:26,429
跟你们一起走 你受了伤不能去
- With you guys. - Not with that cast on you're not.

861
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,599
好吧 去拿头盔吧
All right, all right, all right. Go get your k-pot.

862
01:17:32,572 --> 01:17:34,066
说话呀
Talk to me.

863
01:17:34,074 --> 01:17:35,508
我不能再回去
I can't go back out there.

864
01:17:35,508 --> 01:17:40,280
汤玛斯 大家都很害怕
Thomas, everyone feels the same way you do. All right?

865
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:43,777
你现在的表现才重要
It's what you do right now that makes a difference.

866
01:17:44,517 --> 01:17:46,307
这是你的决定
It's your call.

867
01:17:46,453 --> 01:17:47,811
呼吓?
Hoo-ah?

868
01:17:53,693 --> 01:17:55,221
呼吓
Hoo-ah.

869
01:18:11,277 --> 01:18:15,206
最好把悍马车上的血迹冲掉
It'll probably help to wash the blood out of the humvees.

870
01:18:23,890 --> 01:18:26,124
史崔克中士
Sergeant Struecker!

871
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:30,126
我能去吗?
Sergeant Struecker! Can I go, Sarge?

872
01:18:30,263 --> 01:18:32,332
你有弹药吗? 有
- You got some ammo? - Roger, Sarge!

873
01:18:32,332 --> 01:18:34,224

走哪儿?
Which way?

877
01:19:26,386 --> 01:19:29,678
那儿吧 别这么大声

你是谁?
Who?

881
01:20:26,846 --> 01:20:30,583
我是尤利啦 猪头
It's Yurek! You fucking assholes!

882
01:20:30,583 --> 01:20:32,185

我们差点杀死你
Dude, we almost fucking killed you!

884
01:20:34,988 --> 01:20:38,382
你过来 靠 你们过来

885
01:20:50,537 --> 01:20:52,038
对不起 中士
Sorry, Sarge!

886
01:20:52,038 --> 01:20:54,040
你上哪儿了?
Dude, where the fuck have you been?

887
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:55,975
你带了夜视镜吗?
Never mind, you brought NOD, right?

888
01:20:55,975 --> 01:20:58,378
没有 你知道原因吗?
No, I didn't and you want to know why?

889
01:20:58,378 --> 01:21:01,815
因为你说半小时就能回基地
Because you said: "You won't need that, we'll be back in a half-hour."

890
01:21:01,815 --> 01:21:03,449
我不是跟你说的
Well, I wasn't saying it to you.

891

Nelson, Twombly, this is Galentine. We need a position of the convoy. Over.

901

I can't raise them, Sergeant.

902
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:43,816

I cannot believe this shit! Turn us around, Maddox.

963
01:26:13,392 --> 01:26:15,428
他们会把我们害死
They're trying to get us fucking killed!

964
01:26:15,428 --> 01:26:17,096
快开车吧
Just get it over with! Drive!

965
01:26:17,096 --> 01:26:18,364
该死
Goddamn!

966
01:26:18,364 --> 01:26:20,996
快走吧 开车
Get us out of here, goddamn it, drive!

967
01:26:28,407 --> 01:26:29,909
快踩油门
Keep your foot on the gas!

968
01:26:29,909 --> 01:26:32,439
快踩油门
Keep your foot on the gas!

969
01:26:43,656 --> 01:26:45,014
去死
Fuck!

970
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:48,949
该死
Shit.

971
01:27:04,110 --> 01:27:07,079
舒哈和葛顿下去了
C- 2, Shughart and Gordon are on the deck. Over.

972
01:27:07,079 --> 01:27:08,346
收到
Roger.

973
01:27:34,140 --> 01:27:35,998
是友军!别开枪
Friendlies!

974
01:27:37,877 --> 01:27:39,178
天啊 见到你真好
God, it's good to see you!

975
01:27:39,178 --> 01:27:41,214
你也是 你伤得多重?
It's good to see you. How bad?

976
01:27:41,214 --> 01:27:44,250
我的腿断了 我的背很痛
My leg's broken and my back feels kind of weird.

977
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:46,643
我们要把你救出去
We've got to get you out of here.

978
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:49,451
我把他拉出来
I'm pulling him out! Cover!

979
01:27:52,558 --> 01:27:53,847
等等
Wait, I...

980
01:28:02,101 --> 01:28:03,603
我把你放下来
I'm putting you down.

981
01:28:03,603 --> 01:28:06,606
我们在坠机地点建立防线
C-2, we're at the 64 crash site, securing perimeter.

982
01:28:06,606 --> 01:28:08,274
你还好吧? 我还好
- You all right? - Yeah, I'm good.

983
01:28:08,274 --> 01:28:09,775
枪上膛了
You're locked and loaded.

984
01:28:09,775 --> 01:28:13,579
后面有敌人就帮我们解决掉
Any skinnies come around these corners, you watch our backs.

985
01:28:13,579 --> 01:28:16,541
救援部队呢? 我们就是了
- Where's the rescue squad? - We're it.

986
01:28:21,954 --> 01:28:25,348
好了 停车
All right, stop, stop, Maddox. Stop.

987
01:28:26,058 --> 01:28:27,627
可恶
Son of a bitch.

988
01:28:27,627 --> 01:28:30,730
我们又回到原点
Romeo 64, we're back where we started.

989
01:28:30,730 --> 01:28:33,499
弹药快用完了 大家都受伤
I'm low on ammo, I got many wounded including me...

990
01:28:33,499 --> 01:28:35,534
车辆几乎毁损
...vehicles that are barely running.

991
01:28:35,534 --> 01:28:38,769
好了 你就老实说吧
Okay, Danny, I need a no-b.s. Assessment here.

992
01:28:38,904 --> 01:28:41,331
你能到坠机地点吗?
Can you get to the crash site?

993
01:28:41,774 --> 01:28:44,668
我什么也看不到
Colonel, I can't see shit.

994
01:28:48,447 --> 01:28:49,415
不能
Negative.

995
01:28:49,415 --> 01:28:52,551
伤兵太多 我们去也没用
With the amount of wounded we have, we'd do more harm than good.

996
01:28:52,551 --> 01:28:56,589
我们要回基地补充弹药 然后再回来
We need to come back to base, rearm and regroup and then we can go back out.

997
01:28:56,589 --> 01:28:57,878
收到
Roger.

998
01:28:59,425 --> 01:29:02,990
把他们叫回来 叫他们快走
C-2, bring them back. Get them out of there.

999
01:29:04,163 --> 01:29:06,055
收到 回基地吧
Roger. Return to base.

1000
01:29:06,565 --> 01:29:08,134
我们要回去了
We're going home!

1001
01:29:08,134 --> 01:29:10,425
走吧 左转
Let's go. Left.

1002
01:29:18,444 --> 01:29:22,703
下午4：54

1003
01:29:23,011 --> 01:29:26,610
收到了 车队要回基地
Roger that. Understand. Convoy returning to base.

1004
01:29:31,586 --> 01:29:33,755
怎么回事? 车队被叫回去了
- What's up? - They're sending them back.

1005
01:29:33,755 --> 01:29:35,490
车队要回基地
The convoy's headed back to base camp.

1006
01:29:35,490 --> 01:29:37,951
这太妙了
Oh, now that makes sense, don't it?

1007
01:29:38,159 --> 01:29:42,486
我们要赶紧把伤兵送回去
We need to exfil the wounded now and get out of here before it's too late!

1008
01:29:42,530 --> 01:29:46,267
麦中校要回基地一定有理由
If Colonel McKnight went back to base, then he had a good reason.

1009
01:29:46,267 --> 01:29:47,935
我们的任务不变
It changes nothing.

1010
01:29:47,935 --> 01:29:49,404
大伙儿听好
All right, listen up.

1011
01:29:49,404 --> 01:29:53,697
我们要守住这个据点
We're going to hold the perimeter and we're going to hold the strongpoint.

1012
01:29:54,175 --> 01:29:57,740
保留弹药 有必要才开枪
Conserve your ammo. Only shoot at what you can hit.

1013
01:29:59,247 --> 01:30:01,344
车队一定会回来
The convoy is going to come.

1014
01:30:02,450 --> 01:30:03,739
我们一定能回家
We're going to get home.

1023
01:31:14,122 --> 01:31:15,548
祝好运
Good luck.

1024
01:31:36,677 --> 01:31:39,614
快向第十山地师求救
We need the 10th Mountain in there. Everything they got.

1025
01:31:39,614 --> 01:31:43,042
巴基斯坦军队 马来西亚军队 我要他们的坦克车和装甲车
Pakistanis, Malays, I want their tanks and APCs.

1026
01:31:43,384 --> 01:31:44,852
他们不知道我们的行动
They don't know we've gone in.

1027
01:31:44,852 --> 01:31:49,589
我们捅出了大篓子 整个城市都在攻击我们
We have stirred up a hornet's nest here. We're fighting the entire city.

1028
01:31:49,791 --> 01:31:54,662
我要每一辆军事车辆的支援 快去找 快去
I want every vehicle possible that's got 4 wheels and armor. Get everything.

1029
01:31:54,662 --> 01:31:58,032
我要他们我们的弟兄救出敌区
Once they've assembled, we'll move our men out of the hostile area...

1030
01:31:58,032 --> 01:32:00,701
安全送到巴基斯坦军队的基地
...and back to the Pakistani Stadium, the safe zone.

1031
01:32:00,701 --> 01:32:03,526
快去吧 遵命 长官

1034
01:34:20,608 --> 01:34:22,500
要活捉

... alive!

1036

跪下来 快点
On your knees! Get down! Get down!

1037

Stay with me. You just got a bullet in the leg.

1038

你看到烧轮胎的黑烟吗?
See where those tires are burning? All that black smoke?

1039

我看到了 但我到不了那儿
Roger. I can see it, but I can't get there. Over.

1040
01:35:02,583 --> 01:35:05,886
坠机地点离那儿只有一百米
Go 100 meters past it. That's the crash.

1041
01:35:05,886 --> 01:35:08,155
你不明白
Negative. You don't understand.

1042
01:35:08,155 --> 01:35:12,983
前面都是路障 要找另一条路
It's roadblock after roadblock. You have to find us another route. Over.

1043
01:35:13,327 --> 01:35:17,031
另一条路要绕过整座城市
There ain't one. The only other route is all the way around the city.

1044
01:35:17,031 --> 01:35:18,199
收到

After I'm finished with this, I'll whip you boys up some margaritas.

Do not... I say again, do not fire to the east. We are coming to you.

1057
01:37:00,434 --> 01:37:01,836

Understood.

1058
01:37:01,836 --> 01:37:04,338

他们的祷告就快结束了
They're in prayer but not for much longer.

You won't just run to Eversmann's position.

1075
01:38:17,912 --> 01:38:21,045

1099
01:40:13,394 --> 01:40:14,528
我的右腿
My right thigh!

1100
01:40:14,528 --> 01:40:16,397
用力压
Pressure, yeah.

1101
01:40:16,397 --> 01:40:18,799
我的蛋蛋还在吧? 还在啦
- Are my balls okay? - You still have your balls.

1102
01:40:18,799 --> 01:40:19,967
我需要帮手
I need more men in here.

1103
01:40:19,967 --> 01:40:22,636
汤比 尼森
Twombly! Nelson!

1104
01:40:22,636 --> 01:40:25,996
压住他 真是... 
- Put him down. - Oh, man, that really...

1105
01:40:27,041 --> 01:40:29,343
真是很痛 直接施加压力
- It really hurts! - Direct pressure on that.

1106
01:40:29,343 --> 01:40:31,133
没事的
It's okay, it's okay.

1107
01:40:31,412 --> 01:40:34,078
让我看 好了
- Let me see it! - All right.

1108
01:40:34,248 --> 01:40:36,812
让我看看
All right, let me get a look at that.

1109
01:40:36,917 --> 01:40:38,519
该死
Oh, shit!

1110
01:40:38,519 --> 01:40:39,954
该死
Oh, fuck!

1111
01:40:39,954 --> 01:40:42,423
怎么回事? 没事
- What the fuck was that? - It's all right.

1112
01:40:42,423 --> 01:40:44,658
按住 我要立刻送他回去
Hold that down. I need a medivac now.

1113
01:40:44,658 --> 01:40:46,260
杰利顿
Fuck. Galentine!

1114
01:40:46,260 --> 01:40:47,328
没事
It's all right.

1115
01:40:47,328 --> 01:40:49,425
杰利顿 快帮我接史上尉
Galentine! Get me Captain Steele!

1116
01:40:50,064 --> 01:40:53,167
你还好吧? 请回答
- Sarg'nt Ruiz, how you doing? - Juliet 64, come in. Over.

1117
01:40:53,167 --> 01:40:57,137
他们不会来接我们了
They're not going to come and get us. They're not going to come for us.

1118
01:40:57,137 --> 01:41:00,274
给我闭嘴 振作点
I need you to suck it up, Sarg'nt. I need you to focus.

1119
01:41:00,274 --> 01:41:02,743
你办得到吗? 请回答
- Can you do that? - Juliet 64, come in. Over.

1120
01:41:02,743 --> 01:41:04,943
你能开枪吗?
Now, can you hold your weapon?

1121
01:41:05,012 --> 01:41:06,246
能
Yes, sir.

1122
01:41:06,246 --> 01:41:10,539
谁敢闯进来就让他吃子弹
Anybody comes through that door gets two in the chest and one in the head.

1123
01:41:10,584 --> 01:41:14,288
明白吗? 我可以打仗
- You understand? - I'm still in the fight, sir.

1124
01:41:14,288 --> 01:41:17,424
史上尉 请派人接送伤兵
Captain Steele, I need a medivac in here now!

1125
01:41:17,424 --> 01:41:20,215
史下士中弹 等一下
- Corporal Smith has been hit! - Hold on, 25.

1126
01:41:20,260 --> 01:41:21,762
我可以打仗
Still in the fight.

1127
01:41:21,762 --> 01:41:23,297
他伤得很重
He's hurt pretty bad.

1128
01:41:23,297 --> 01:41:27,101
我们也有伤兵 你要留在原地
25, we got wounded too. You'll have to maintain your situation, over.

1129
01:41:27,101 --> 01:41:29,961
他再不进医院就会没命
If he doesn't get help in a half-hour, he's in trouble!

1130
01:41:30,437 --> 01:41:32,740
C-2 这是部队
C- 2, this is 64.

1131
01:41:32,740 --> 01:41:37,044
第四小队需要医疗救援
Requesting a medivac for a critically wounded at Chalk Four's location. Over.

1132
01:41:37,044 --> 01:41:40,114
第四小队请求医疗救援
Command, Chalk Four is requesting medivac.

1133
01:41:40,114 --> 01:41:42,746
战况激烈 不能冒险
Can't risk it. It's still too hot.

1134
01:41:42,916 --> 01:41:48,085
我们不能派出医疗救援 撑下去
Captain, we cannot send in medivac at this time. Sit tight. Over.

1135
01:41:48,122 --> 01:41:52,159
25号 这是64号  没有医疗救援 战况太激烈
25, this is 64. Negative on the medivac. It's not possible.

1136
01:41:52,159 --> 01:41:56,225
不能再冒险派救援直升机 你们要撑下去
JOC cannot risk another bird. You'll just have to hold on.

1137
01:42:02,503 --> 01:42:04,004
让我来
All right. I got him.

1138
01:42:04,004 --> 01:42:06,738
直接压在伤口上
I want direct pressure on the wound.

1139
01:42:08,308 --> 01:42:10,405
你不会有事的
It's going to be all right.

1140
01:42:49,183 --> 01:42:52,350
这是我的直升机
I think this is mine!

1141
01:42:54,688 --> 01:42:58,025
这是凯罗11号  我到了杜伦的坠机地点
This is Kilo 11. I'm at the Durant crash site.

1142
01:42:58,025 --> 01:42:59,724
收到
Roger that.

1143
01:43:21,014 --> 01:43:23,016
第二坠机地点安全
Crash site two secured.

1144
01:43:23,016 --> 01:43:25,682
柯中校找你
Lieutenant Colonel Cribbs for you, sir.

1145
01:43:25,886 --> 01:43:26,858
柯中校?
Cribbs?

1146
01:43:26,858 --> 01:43:28,755
第十山地师基地

1147
01:43:28,755 --> 01:43:31,191
他们还在讨论路线 还要多久?
- They're still debating the route. - How long?

1148
01:43:31,191 --> 01:43:32,993
至少两个小时
At least a couple of hours.

1149
01:43:32,993 --> 01:43:34,728
来不及了
We haven't got that long, Joe.

1150
01:43:34,728 --> 01:43:39,533
巴基斯坦将军说 我们事先没有通知他们
Pakistani General says, since we didn't deign to inform him of the raid...

1151
01:43:39,533 --> 01:43:43,637
动员第十山地师要花点时间
...it'll take some time to mobilize the 10th Mountain and 100 vehicles.

1152
01:43:43,637 --> 01:43:45,839
你告诉他
You tell the general this:

1153
01:43:45,839 --> 01:43:48,942
我了解 但是我也要提醒他
I understand, but it is my duty to remind him...

1154
01:43:48,942 --> 01:43:53,213
我的手下被武装民兵团团包围
...that my men are surrounded by thousands of armed Somali militia.

1155
01:43:53,213 --> 01:43:58,685
我们必须立刻把他们救出敌区
It's imperative that we move them out of the hostile area and into the safe zone.

1156
01:43:58,685 --> 01:44:00,509
我需要他的帮助
I need his help now.

1157
01:44:01,221 --> 01:44:02,749
是 长官
Yes, sir.

1158
01:44:07,561 --> 01:44:09,089
杜伦
Durant.

1159
01:44:09,496 --> 01:44:12,264
迈可杜伦
Michael Durant.

1160
01:44:12,699 --> 01:44:13,988
是的
Yes.

1161
01:44:14,167 --> 01:44:16,770
你是杀我同胞的游骑兵队员?
You are the Ranger who kills my people?

1162
01:44:16,770 --> 01:44:20,471
我不是 我是驾驶员
I'm not a Ranger. I'm a pilot.

1163
01:44:24,111 --> 01:44:25,708
没错
That's right.

1164
01:44:26,079 --> 01:44:29,371
美国人不抽烟了
None of you Americans smoke anymore.

1165
01:44:32,285 --> 01:44:37,215
你们都过着无趣的生活
You all live long, dull, uninteresting lives.

1166
01:44:38,792 --> 01:44:40,957
你为什么要抓我?
What do you want with me?

1167
01:44:41,495 --> 01:44:43,524
你们手上有我们的人质
You have taken hostages.

1168
01:44:44,231 --> 01:44:46,032
我们手上有你
We have you.

1169
01:44:46,032 --> 01:44:49,426
美国政府才不会跟你谈判
My government will never negotiate for me.

1170
01:44:49,669 --> 01:44:54,531
那么我就跟你谈判吧
Then perhaps you and I can negotiate, huh?

1171
01:44:55,709 --> 01:44:58,534
我们都是军人
Soldier to soldier.

1172
01:45:04,184 --> 01:45:06,281
我不是指挥官
I'm not in charge.

1173
01:45:09,256 --> 01:45:13,993
当然不是 你们能杀人却不能谈判
Course not. You have the power to kill, but not negotiate.

1174
01:45:14,161 --> 01:45:17,362
在索马利亚 杀人就是谈判
In Somalia, killing is negotiation.

1175
01:45:18,632 --> 01:45:22,202
你们真的以为抓到艾迪德将军
Do you really think if you get General Aidid...

1176
01:45:22,202 --> 01:45:25,705
我们就会放下武器
...we will simply put down our weapons...

1177
01:45:25,705 --> 01:45:28,997
接受美式民主
...and adopt American democracy?

1178
01:45:29,142 --> 01:45:31,239
或是停止杀戮吗?
That the killing will stop?

1179
01:45:31,344 --> 01:45:35,705
我只知道没有胜利就没有和平
We know this: Without victory, there can be no peace.

1180
01:45:36,183 --> 01:45:38,917
杀戮永远不会停止
There will always be killing, you see?

1181
01:45:39,085 --> 01:45:41,580
这就是我们的方法 迈可杜伦 我们不会抛弃你
This is how things are in our world.

1182
01:45:54,134 --> 01:45:58,097
迈可杜伦 我们不会抛弃你
Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind.

1183
01:45:59,940 --> 01:46:03,676
迈可杜伦 我们不会抛弃你
Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind.

1184
01:46:06,112 --> 01:46:09,279
换你来 用双手按住
You got to take over from me. Both hands.

1185
01:46:16,690 --> 01:46:20,126
伤口在股动脉 但是我看不到
It's the femoral artery, but I can't see it.

1186
01:46:20,126 --> 01:46:23,797
它一定缩进骨盆
Which means that it's retracted up into the pelvis.

1187
01:46:23,797 --> 01:46:28,301
我必须把它夹住 这样才能止血
I have to find it and clamp it. It's the only way to stop the bleeding.

1188
01:46:28,301 --> 01:46:30,694
麻醉剂用完了
I got no more IVs.

1189
01:46:31,671 --> 01:46:34,708
所以我要你帮忙 好吗?
So, I'm going to need you to assist. Okay?

1190
01:46:34,708 --> 01:46:36,635
好
Yeah, yeah.

1191
01:46:37,277 --> 01:46:40,944
听好 我要做一件事
Now listen, Jamie. I got to do something, it's going to hurt.

1192
01:46:41,915 --> 01:46:45,819
你会很痛 不过我必须帮助你
I got to cause you more pain, but I have to do it to help you.

1193
01:46:45,819 --> 01:46:47,420
你懂吗?
All right, you understand?

1194
01:46:47,420 --> 01:46:49,623
吗啡 不行
- Morphine. - I can't.

1195
01:46:49,623 --> 01:46:52,292
那会降低你的心跳
It'll lower your heart rate too far. I'm sorry.

1196
01:46:52,292 --> 01:46:54,890
汤比 抓住他的手
Twombly, why don't you take his hands?

1197
01:46:59,099 --> 01:47:02,102
把伤口撑开 压住他的大腿
Hold the wound open, keep pressure on the top of the leg.

1198
01:47:02,102 --> 01:47:04,597
尤利 帮我拿手电筒
Yurek, take the feet and a flashlight.

1199
01:47:04,704 --> 01:47:05,906
我数到三
On my count.

1200
01:47:05,906 --> 01:47:08,197
准备好了
All right, Jamie. All right.

1201
01:47:10,176 --> 01:47:12,637
1 2
One. Two.

1202
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:14,638
3
Three

1203
01:47:22,055 --> 01:47:24,789
等等 摸到了
Wait, wait. Okay. I feel it.

1204
01:47:25,125 --> 01:47:26,790
我摸到脉搏
I feel the pulse.

1205
01:47:28,061 --> 01:47:29,462
我找到了
I got it. I got it.

1206
01:47:29,462 --> 01:47:31,131
找到了…
I got it, yeah. I got it.

1207
01:47:31,131 --> 01:47:33,023
找到了? 找到了
- I got it. - You got it?

1208
01:47:33,166 --> 01:47:34,455
夹子
Clamp?

1209
01:47:36,570 --> 01:47:38,071
钳住了
I got it clamped.

1210
01:47:38,071 --> 01:47:39,339
拿住 好
- Hold it. - Got it.

1211
01:47:39,339 --> 01:47:40,901
这里 抓住
Here, grab it.

1212
01:47:41,274 --> 01:47:43,243
它破了 我抓住了
- It's tearing. - I got it.

1213
01:47:43,243 --> 01:47:45,178
它又缩回去了 抓住它
- Doc, it's going back in! - Hold it!

1214
01:47:45,178 --> 01:47:46,706
破了
It's tearing!

1215
01:47:46,746 --> 01:47:50,015
出来 撑开伤口 撑开了
- Okay. Get out. Hold the wound. - Okay, I'm holding.

1216
01:47:50,951 --> 01:47:52,548
把手拿开
Move your hand.

1217
01:48:03,463 --> 01:48:04,991
怎么了?
What?

1218
01:48:23,817 --> 01:48:25,106
治好了吗?
Fix it?

1219
01:48:28,421 --> 01:48:31,155
对 治好了
Yeah, yeah. We got it.

1220
01:48:46,506 --> 01:48:48,375
你在干什么?
What the hell are you doing?

1221
01:48:48,375 --> 01:48:52,979
关键是磨咖啡豆 不能磨得太细或太粗
It's all in the grind, Sarg'nt. Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.

1222
01:48:52,979 --> 01:48:55,941
葛姆 你都弄好了
Grimesy, you are squared away.

1223
01:49:11,965 --> 01:49:16,224
来一杯热腾腾的咖啡吧
Sarg'nt, how would you like a nice hot cup of Joe?

1224
01:49:17,737 --> 01:49:19,539
黄金海岸口味
Gold Coast blend.

1225
01:49:19,539 --> 01:49:22,774
坐下来 我看你的伤口
Sit down. I want to take a look at that foot.

1226
01:49:23,076 --> 01:49:25,469
这不算什么 来
- No, it's not a problem. - Come on.

1227
01:49:31,618 --> 01:49:35,012
他们从哪儿把你找来? 办公桌后面
- Where the hell did they find you? - Behind a desk.

1228
01:49:36,222 --> 01:49:39,548
是真的 我没开玩笑
No, really. What, you think I'm kidding?

1229
01:49:42,929 --> 01:49:45,026
有人受伤吗? 没有
- Is anybody hit? - We're good!

1230
01:49:50,103 --> 01:49:51,337
你们没事吧?
You all right?

1231
01:49:51,337 --> 01:49:52,539
没事
Yeah!

1232
01:49:52,539 --> 01:49:54,074
大家都没事吧?

If we don't hold back this city...

1246

对不起
I'm sorry.

1258
01:53:23,016 --> 01:53:26,452
你不必道歉
You don't have anything to be sorry for.

1259
01:53:26,452 --> 01:53:29,915
你救了汤比 你干得很好

1277
01:54:32,819 --> 01:54:34,586
没问题…
It's nothing.

1278
01:54:35,521 --> 01:54:37,254
没问题
It's nothing.

1279
01:54:37,991 --> 01:54:39,192

What are you doing?

1288
01:56:16,756 --> 01:56:18,785
我们需要弹药
We need the ammo.

1289
01:56:26,766 --> 01:56:28,863
你已经尽了力
You did all you could here.

1290
01:56:29,102 --> 01:56:31,632
他们应该派直升机救援

1291
01:56:31,838 --> 01:56:35,775
它一定会被击落
Right now we'd be out there defending another crashed chopper.

1292
01:56:35,775 --> 01:56:38,566
更多人会受伤
More men would get torn up.

1293
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:42,911
也许吧
Maybe.

1294
01:56:43,116 --> 01:56:46,085
别想那么多
See, you're thinking. Don't.

1295
01:56:46,085 --> 01:56:49,188
你不能决定谁受伤
Because, Sergeant, you can't control who gets hit or who doesn't.

1296
01:56:49,188 --> 01:56:52,158
或是谁从直升机上摔落
Who falls out of a chopper or why.

1297
01:56:52,158 --> 01:56:55,086
这是战争 你也无能为力
It ain't up to you. It's just war.

1298
01:56:56,796 --> 01:56:59,087
史密斯还是死了
Yeah, well, Smith's still dead.

1299
01:57:00,466 --> 01:57:05,238
都是因为贝克朋摔下来 你想这么多也没用
- This all happened because Blackburn fell. - Should have, could have, don't matter.

1300
01:57:05,238 --> 01:57:09,304
以后你有的是时间去想
You'll get plenty of time to think about all that later. Believe me.

1301
01:57:12,778 --> 01:57:16,206
你把弟兄们带到这儿
Sergeant, you got your men this far.

1302

你已经尽了全力

1303
01:57:18,651 --> 01:57:22,409
你要想该怎么把他们救出去
You need to start thinking about getting these men out of here.

1304
01:57:28,528 --> 01:57:30,728

1310
01:58:02,562 --> 01:58:06,065
我分不出谁是敌谁是友 状况太混乱了
Eversmann, I can't tell who's who down there. Too much activity.

1311
01:58:06,065 --> 01:58:08,801
我会用红外线求生灯做记号
I'll mark the target with a strobe! Over.

遵命
Roger.

1371
02:03:38,964 --> 02:03:41,494
快点 把他抬出来 好了
- Come on. Bring him through. - I got him.

1372
02:03:42,067 --> 02:03:45,530
把伤兵救出来 遵命
- Get all his gear. Get the wounded out. - Got you, sir!

1373
02:03:45,776 --> 02:03:50,172
10月4日 星期一 早上5：45

1374
02:03:50,843 --> 02:03:52,542
快走 好

1375
02:03:52,912 --> 02:03:55,237
快走
Move out! Move out! Let's go!

1376
02:04:05,024 --> 02:04:06,313
该死
Fuck!

1377
02:04:08,861 --> 02:04:10,396
要爆炸了
Fire in the hole!

1378
02:04:10,396 --> 02:04:12,527
快走 走吧
- Let's go! Move! - Let's go!

1379
02:04:22,775 --> 02:04:26,245
快开门 我们要上去 挤不下了 坐到车顶
- Open the hatch! We got men back here! - No room here! Go on the roof!

1380
02:04:26,245 --> 02:04:27,413
怎么回事?
What's going on?

1381
02:04:27,413 --> 02:04:30,705
车顶? 我才不坐车顶
- The roof? - I'm not getting on no fucking roof!

1382
02:04:31,383 --> 02:04:33,082
没地方坐了
No, no, it's full.

1383
02:04:34,219 --> 02:04:37,784
前进吧 用装甲车当掩护
We're running out. Keep moving. Use the vehicles as cover.

1384
02:04:39,892 --> 02:04:42,251
走吧
Move it! Let's go!

1385
02:04:58,877 --> 02:05:01,702
等一下
All right, hold it up. Hold it up.

1386

Go!

1388
02:06:00,973 --> 02:06:03,707
趴下来
Get down! Get down!

1389
02:06:04,643 --> 02:06:06,205
让开
Get down, lady!

1390
02:06:08,414 --> 02:06:10,079
我没子弹了
I'm out of ammo!

1391
02:06:11,150 --> 02:06:13,441
桑德森 我没子弹了
Sanderson, I'm out of ammo!

1392
02:06:18,157 --> 02:06:20,049
别拿枪
Don't you do it.

1393
02:06:20,359 --> 02:06:23,150
你在干嘛? 别开枪
- What are you doing? - Don't you damn do it.

1394
02:06:24,663 --> 02:06:26,328
走吧
Kurth, let's go!

1395
02:08:49,875 --> 02:08:51,665
小心点
Easy.

1396
02:09:41,260 --> 02:09:43,095
可恶
Ah, shit.

1397
02:09:43,095 --> 02:09:47,058
子弹错过你的颈静脉 别动
Bullet missed your jugular by about three millimeters. Don't move.

1398
02:09:48,433 --> 02:09:50,758
快点啦
Hurry up, hurry up.

1399
02:09:53,839 --> 02:09:58,132
咖啡没了 我替你倒了茶
Little short on coffee, but I got you some tea.

1400
02:10:02,114 --> 02:10:04,041
你还好吧?
How you doing, soldier?

1401
02:10:04,950 --> 02:10:07,115
我没有感觉
Can't feel a thing.

1402
02:10:16,895 --> 02:10:18,787
替他量脉搏
Take his pulse.

1403
02:10:51,830 --> 02:10:53,529
中士
Hey, Sarg'nt.

1404
02:10:57,803 --> 02:10:58,971
队长
Captain.

1405
02:10:58,971 --> 02:11:02,263
你还好吧?
Lorenzo. How you doing?

1406
02:11:04,576 --> 02:11:09,581
子弹穿过去 医官说我过两天就没事
It went in and out, so the medic said I should be okay in a couple of days.

1407
02:11:09,581 --> 02:11:11,576
真是好消息
That's great news.

1408
02:11:11,883 --> 02:11:13,685
我们要继续打吗?
Are we going after them?

1409
02:11:13,685 --> 02:11:16,715
当然了 我们要重新整队
You bet your ass we will. We got to regroup.

1410
02:11:17,990 --> 02:11:20,224
别把我留下来
Don't go out there without me.

1411
02:11:20,926 --> 02:11:24,718
别丢下我就回去
Don't go back out there without me.

1412
02:11:25,163 --> 02:11:27,363
我还能打仗
I can still do my job.

1413
02:11:28,834 --> 02:11:31,762
好好休息吧
You get some rest now, okay?

1414
02:11:46,618 --> 02:11:48,317
你要回去?
You're going back in?

1415
02:11:50,122 --> 02:11:52,253
战区还有弟兄
There are still men out there.

1416
02:11:54,359 --> 02:11:56,217
该死
Goddamn.

1417
02:12:01,099 --> 02:12:02,696
我每次回家
When I go home...

1418
02:12:03,402 --> 02:12:05,070
他们都问我
...and people ask me:

1419
02:12:05,070 --> 02:12:08,703
胡特 你为什么从军?
"Hey, Hoot, why do you do it, man?

1420
02:12:08,974 --> 02:12:13,108
难道你是打仗打上瘾吗?
"Why? You some kind of war junkie?"

1421
02:12:13,612 --> 02:12:16,346
我一句话也不说
I won't say a goddamn word.

1422
02:12:16,381 --> 02:12:17,909
为什么?
Why?

1423
02:12:18,250 --> 02:12:20,381
他们不会懂
They won't understand.

1424
02:12:21,820 --> 02:12:24,418
他们不懂我们干嘛打仗
They won't understand why we do it.

1425
02:12:25,624 --> 02:12:30,054
我们是为了同胞弟兄拼命
They won't understand it's about the men next to you.

1426
02:12:31,596 --> 02:12:33,227
就这么简单
And that's it.

1427
02:12:35,100 --> 02:12:36,731
很简单
That's all it is.

1428
02:12:46,778 --> 02:12:51,447
想都别想 我习惯单枪匹马
Don't even think about it, all right? I'm better on my own.

1429
02:12:56,288 --> 02:12:59,580
星期一 又是一周的开始
We started a whole new week. It's Monday.

1430
02:13:12,137 --> 02:13:14,372
贝克朋问我
I was talking to Blackburn the other day...

1431
02:13:14,372 --> 02:13:19,371
什么改变了? 我们为什么要回家?
... and he asked me, "What changed? Why are we going home?"

1432
02:13:20,612 --> 02:13:23,148
我说什么都没变
And I said, "Nothing."

1433
02:13:23,148 --> 02:13:27,384
但这不是实话 一切都变了
But that's not true, you know. I think everything's changed.

1434
02:13:28,487 --> 02:13:30,277
我也变了
I know I've changed.

1435
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:38,597
之前有一个朋友问我
A friend of mine asked me before I got here...

1436
02:13:38,597 --> 02:13:40,999
那是在我们被派来之前
It was when we were all shipping out.

1437
02:13:40,999 --> 02:13:42,789
他问我
He asked me:

1438
02:13:43,768 --> 02:13:46,798
你为什么要去打别人的仗?
"Why are you going to fight somebody else's war?

1439
02:13:47,205 --> 02:13:49,939
你自以为是英雄吗?
"What, do y'all think you're heroes?"

1440
02:13:52,611 --> 02:13:55,311
当时我不知道该说什么
I didn't know what to say at the time...

1441
02:13:57,949 --> 02:14:00,649
现在我的答案是不
...but if he asked me again, I'd say no.

1442
02:14:02,921 --> 02:14:05,246
我不想当英雄
I'd say there's no way in hell.

1443
02:14:06,057 --> 02:14:08,382
没有人想当英雄
Nobody asks to be a hero.

1444
02:14:13,431 --> 02:14:15,995
只是有时候时势造英雄
It just sometimes turns out that way.

1445
02:14:19,671 --> 02:14:23,031
我会去找你的父母
I'll talk to your ma and pa when I get home, okay?

1446
02:15:01,584 --> 02:15:04,054
一千多名索马利亚人死亡

1447
02:15:04,054 --> 02:15:06,318
十九名美军阵亡

1448
02:15:06,318 --> 02:15:10,315
我的爱 你会坚强地活下去
My love, you are strong and you will do well in life.

1449
02:15:11,056 --> 02:15:13,824
我爱你和我的孩子
I love you and my children deeply.

1450
02:15:14,426 --> 02:15:18,218
每一天都会成长茁壮
Today and tomorrow, let each day grow and grow.

1451
02:15:19,130 --> 02:15:23,594
保持笑容 千万别被困境打倒
Keep smiling and never give up, even when things get you down.

1452
02:15:24,603 --> 02:15:27,337
最后 我的爱
So, in closing, my love...

1453
02:15:27,405 --> 02:15:31,539
今晚替我哄我的孩子入睡
... tonight, tuck my children in bed warmly.

1454
02:15:31,676 --> 02:15:36,481
跟他们说我爱他们... 替我抱抱他们
Tell them I love them. Then hug them for me...

1455
02:15:36,481 --> 02:15:39,614
替爸爸亲吻他们道晚安
... and give them both a kiss good night for Daddy.

获追赠荣誉勋章的士兵

1459

两星期后 柯林顿总统

1461
02:15:54,604 --> 02:15:57,634
从索马利亚撤军
