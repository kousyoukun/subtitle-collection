1
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,150
或许你会觉得我的故事耳熟能详
{\fs20}You may think you know my story.

2
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,820
人人传颂我的事迹
{\fs20}Many have told it.

3
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,290
它已成为历史  成为神话
{\fs20}It has long passed into history... into myth.

4
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:39,040
{\an8}奥菲莉娅

5
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,110
我所见的因果循环之事
{\fs20}I have seen more of heaven and hell

6
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,100
比人们想象的还多
{\fs20}than most people dream of.

7
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,900
我一直是个任性的女孩
{\fs20}But I was always a willful girl

8
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,860
随心所欲  直言不讳
{\fs20}and followed my heart and spoke my mind.

9
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,240
现在是时候
{\fs20}And it is high time

10
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,040
由我亲自讲述  我的故事
{\fs20}I should tell you my story myself.

11
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,830
下面的小心
{\fs20}Mind out below!

12
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,850
奥菲莉娅  小心
{\fs20}Ophelia. Careful.

13
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,660
你又把那只老鼠揣兜里了吗
{\fs20}Is that mouse in your pocket again?

14
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,660
安静点
{\fs20}Be quiet!

15
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,490
雷欧提斯  我和你一起去
{\fs20}Laertes, I'm coming with you!

16
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,160
不要
{\fs20}Don't!

17
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:52,980
快回去  奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}Go back, Ophelia!

18
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,410
但是想想那些书
{\fs20}But think of all the books!

19
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,380
-学生也一样  -真可爱
{\fs20}- So, students as well. - Very sweet.

20
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,800
我晚点教你
{\fs20}I'll teach you later.

21
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,510
安静  准备上课
{\fs20}Hush now, make ready for your studies.

22
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,600
-小心龙来啦  -什么龙
{\fs20}- Watch out for dragons! - Dragons?

23
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,150
这是条捷径
{\fs20}It's a shortcut.

24
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,940
一对兔子要剥皮
{\fs20}Brace of rabbits for skinning.

25
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,030
小流氓
{\fs20}Ooh, little rascal!

26
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,490
奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}Ophelia!

27
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,250
-别过去  -别管我  我想看看
{\fs20}- Don't! - Leave me. I want to see.

28
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,380
敬哈姆雷特王子
{\fs20}To Prince Hamlet!

29
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,680
他将前往威腾堡大学
{\fs20}Leaving us for the great University of Wittenberg.

30
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,060
并且今天15岁了
{\fs20}Fifteen years old today.

31
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,560
已脱稚气  还未成人
{\fs20}Little more than a boy, little less than a man.

32
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,190
他在羞辱王子吗
{\fs20}He insults the prince?

33
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,730
那是他的叔叔  国王的弟弟
{\fs20}That's his uncle, the king's brother.

34
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,360
他母亲的掌上明珠
{\fs20}Apple of his mother's eye.

35
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,460
当然了  就是苹果诱惑了
{\fs20}Of course, it was an apple that tempted

36
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,910
伊甸园里的女人
{\fs20}a woman in the Garden of Eden.

37
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,200
我一直认为是条蛇干的
{\fs20}I had always thought it was a snake.

38
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,720
那可是智慧树的果实
{\fs20}It was an apple of knowledge,

39
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,240
而智慧扼杀无知
{\fs20}and knowledge kills innocence

40
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,080
正如冬天的雪摧残夏日的花
{\fs20}as surely as winter snow kills summer blooms.

41
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,500
奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}Ophelia!

42
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,670
那我得担心我儿子上了大学
{\fs20}Then I fear for my son at university

43
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,920
他们会给他灌输智慧
{\fs20}where they will fill him with knowledge.

44
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:25,300
-敬王子  -敬王子
{\fs20}- To the prince! - To the prince!

45
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,300
祝他早日离开母亲的膝上
{\fs20}May he someday rise from his mother's lap.

46
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,930
我觉得苹果跟这件事没有关系
{\fs20}I think the apple is quite innocent in the matter.

47
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,350
奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}Ophelia!

48
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,520
奥菲莉娅是什么
{\fs20}What is an Ophelia?

49
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,440
陛下  是个孩子
{\fs20}Your Majesty, it is a child

50
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,280
她尖牙利嘴  不听管束
{\fs20}very much like a snake's tooth and

51
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,780
如同在我掌管的花园里的一条蛇
{\fs20}a true snake she is, in the garden of my duty.

52
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,070
她
{\fs20}She?

53
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,660
和她那令人惋惜的已故母亲
{\fs20}The exact copy and very picture

54
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,290
如同一个模子刻出来的
{\fs20}of her departed and much lamented mother.

55
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:01,290
我的奥菲莉娅  我的女儿  我的宝贝
{\fs20}My Ophelia, my daughter, my treasure.

56
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,850
是个需要打磨的宝贝
{\fs20}A treasure most in want of polishing.

57
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,570
打磨宝贝是女人的职责
{\fs20}This is ladies' work to polish such a treasure,

58
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,060
可惜我不是女人
{\fs20}and alas, I am no lady.

59
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,230
确实可惜
{\fs20}Alas indeed.

60
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,560
我虽是个丫头
{\fs20}I may be a lass,

61
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,320
但也没必要这样唉声叹气
{\fs20}but there is no call for such alas-ing.

62
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,570
我不想成为一个小伙子
{\fs20}I would not want to be a lad.

63
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,490
那她就是我的侍女了
{\fs20}Then she shall be one of my ladies

64
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,950
我们会照料她长大
{\fs20}and we shall see to the raising of her.

65
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,170
-放开我  -别动  不要乱动
{\fs20}- Let me go! - Hold still. Stop moving.

66
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,680
-别动  -真是不幸
{\fs20}- Hold still. - Absolutely tragic.

67
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,010
亲爱的
{\fs20}Oh, dear.

68
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,980
别动
{\fs20}Stop!

69
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,720
-她和你挺配的  -别胡说
{\fs20}- She's fair for you. - Ah, nonsense.

70
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,350
你跳得像只山羊  奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}You dance like a goat, Ophelia.

71
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,950
她父亲是个马屁精
{\fs20}Her father's a flatterer.

72
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:45,120
挤破脑袋往上爬
{\fs20}He wormed his way in through dirt.

73
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,880
你看到她怎么戴花的吗
{\fs20}Have you seen how she wears flowers

74
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,290
她头上从不戴珠宝
{\fs20}never jewels in her hair

75
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,460
我猜她一直在泥土里打滚
{\fs20}I thought she'd been rolling in the dirt.

76
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,550
闻起来有花园泥土的味道
{\fs20}She smells of garden soil.

77
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:59,470
她父亲买不起珠宝 她是平民
{\fs20}Her father can't afford jewels. She is common.

78
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,520
她怎么会看中她呢
{\fs20}Whatever does she see in her?

79
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,440
你来了  奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}There you are, Ophelia.

80
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,280
这次怎么去这么久
{\fs20}What took you so long this time?

81
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,780
小心点
{\fs20}Watch yourself.

82
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,530
-王后殿下  -王后殿下
{\fs20}- My Lady. - My Lady.

83
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,660
快  水要凉了
{\fs20}Quick, before the water cools.

84
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,120
-我闻起来怎么样  -像花园一样
{\fs20}- What do I smell? - Like a garden.

85
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:36,010
我洗澡的花瓣吗  放进去吧
{\fs20}Petals for my bath?  Go ahead.

86
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,350
多好的主意啊  姑娘们  谢谢
{\fs20}What a lovely idea, girls, thank you.

87
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,470
荣幸之至  王后殿下
{\fs20}You are most welcome, My Lady.

88
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,950
晚安  把蜡烛拿走
{\fs20}Goodnight. Take the candles.

89
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,040
我的眼睛太疲累  看不下去了
{\fs20}My eyes are too weary to read.

90
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,870
我可以读给您听  王后殿下
{\fs20}I could read to you, My Lady.

91
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,380
你会识字吗
{\fs20}A girl who knows how to read?

92
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,050
我哥哥教我的
{\fs20}My brother teaches me.

93
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,390
晚安  我的王后
{\fs20}Goodnight, my queen.

94
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,510
祝您好梦  王后殿下
{\fs20}Sleep well, My Lady.

95
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,060
王后殿下
{\fs20}My Lady.

96
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,400
把门关上吧
{\fs20}Shut the door behind you.

97
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,400
你见过院子里的母鸡
{\fs20}Have you seen how the hens in the yard

98
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,410
是如何互相啄食的吗
{\fs20}peck at each other?

99
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,580
它们都选择欺负弱小的那只
{\fs20}Each choosing the one just weaker.

100
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,340
为什么这些姑娘要欺负你
{\fs20}Why do the ladies peck at you?

101
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,760
我出身卑微  王后殿下
{\fs20}I'm not noble, My Lady.

102
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,100
你可知我并非在宫廷里长大
{\fs20}Did you know I was not raised at court?

103
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,280
小时候我和姐姐被送去了
{\fs20}My sister and I were sent as girls to

104
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,520
法国的一个修道院
{\fs20}a convent in France.

105
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,190
即使在那里  也会欺凌弱小
{\fs20}But even there, there were hens and they pecked.

106
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,900
修女们也这样吗
{\fs20}Even the nuns?

107
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,280
但我姐姐会保护我
{\fs20}But I had my sister to defend me.

108
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,910
那就读给我听吧  如果你识字的话
{\fs20}Read to me, then. If you really can.

109
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,460
在阿朗松有一个女人
{\fs20}"A woman of Alencon

110
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:43,130
为了利益而结婚
{\fs20}having married for her profit..

111
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:47,640
她找到一位能令她愉悦的绅士
{\fs20}...found a gentleman who offered her pleasure."

112
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,140
这不是祷告书
{\fs20}This is no devotional book.

113
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,270
这是比祈祷更重要的东西
{\fs20}Something much more important than prayer.

114
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,820
继续读
{\fs20}Read on.

115
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:09,910
那位先生叫她与自己
{\fs20}"The gentleman caused her to find herself

116
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,620
在果园里独处
{\fs20}alone with him in an orchard."

117
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,710
他在这里对她说
{\fs20}"Here he said unto her..

118
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,670
"夫人  我的心只属于您"
{\fs20}'Madam, my heart belongs to you.'"

119
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:30,430
她断然拒绝  说他只是爱她的地位
{\fs20}"She protested that he loved her rank alone.

120
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,070
他回答道  "夫人
{\fs20}"And he replied, 'Madam,

121
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,190
没有什么能增添你的魅力
{\fs20}nothing could add to your graces,

122
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,940
唯有一件可以使脸蛋更加艳丽
{\fs20}except the one thing that can make a face more beautiful,

123
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:46,620
那便是欢欣喜悦之情"
{\fs20}which is...transformation...in ecstasy.'"

124
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:06,930
"我主已令我足够欢喜"  女人回道
{\fs20}"'My Lord gratifies me so much, ' replied she.

125
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:10,220
我已别无所求
{\fs20}"I do not ask for any other thing.

126
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,390
"仁慈点吧  好夫人"  他喊道
{\fs20}"'Have mercy, good lady,' cried he

127
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,900
"我爱得快发疯了"
{\fs20}"'for I am gone mad with love.'

128
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,400
听了这话  这位夫人晕了过去
{\fs20}"At this, the lady did swoon.

129
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,240
那位绅士  看到她快被征服
{\fs20}"Then the gentleman, seeing her half-conquered

130
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,530
为了达到他的目的
{\fs20}"plied her to good purpose

131
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,450
他一直隐藏自己的激情
{\fs20}with his long-concealed passion."

132
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,640
王子  王子  他来了
{\fs20}The prince! The prince! He comes!

133
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,140
-他来了  -快看  霍拉旭
{\fs20}- Here he is! - Look at this, Horatio.

134
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,270
我说过我们会受到欢迎的
{\fs20}I told you we'd have a welcome.

135
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:57,230
那么英俊  那么成熟
{\fs20}Oh, and so handsome, so grown.

136
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,100
王者之范
{\fs20}Every inch a king.

137
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,700
亲爱的儿子
{\fs20}My dear son!

138
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:13,160
-回家真好  -是的
{\fs20}- It's good to be home. - Yes.

139
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,540
来吧  霍拉旭
{\fs20}Come, Horatio.

140
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,080
可不想在到家的时候落下你
{\fs20}Don't wanna lose you at the end of the journey.

141
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,040
现在我们去吃饭吧
{\fs20}And now we feast.

142
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,810
我记得这是个钓鱼的好地方
{\fs20}I remember this as an excellent place to fish.

143
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,080
走吧  哈姆雷特
{\fs20}Come away, Hamlet.

144
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,360
我们试试去更远的地方
{\fs20}Let's, let's try farther down.

145
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,570
确实有条神奇的鱼  住在这小树林里
{\fs20}A wondrous fish indeed, inhabits the grove.

146
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,490
这条鱼想要上岸
{\fs20}The fish would like to come ashore.

147
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,120
这条鱼当然可以上岸
{\fs20}Oh, the fish is very welcome.

148
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,660
没有鱼愿意接近渔夫
{\fs20}No fish comes willing to the fisherman.

149
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,330
殿下  这位是女王的侍女
{\fs20}My Lord, it's one of the queen's ladies in waiting.

150
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:03,960
那她应当不介意等我钓到鱼再上岸吧
{\fs20}Then she will not mind waiting till I catch a fish.

151
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,260
侍女之中我最不喜欢等待
{\fs20}Of all of the ladies, I'm least fond of waiting.

152
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,770
你的内心有两个声音在挣扎
{\fs20}There are two sides struggling in you.

153
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,530
一个卑鄙  一个高尚
{\fs20}One is baser, one better.

154
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,690
她在给我占卜  霍拉旭
{\fs20}She tells my fortune, Horatio.

155
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,660
殿下  这是你的不幸
{\fs20}My Lord, it is your misfortune.

156
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,490
-走吧  哈姆雷特  -等一下
{\fs20}- Come away, Hamlet. - Stay.

157
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,130
这条鱼溜得真快  霍拉旭
{\fs20}'Tis a quick fish, Horatio!

158
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,840
把网给我
{\fs20}Get me my net!

159
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,550
如此美丽的色调  如此逼真
{\fs20}Such lovely shades and so lifelike.

160
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,510
还有这些线条
{\fs20}And these threads.

161
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,720
在森林里独处片刻
{\fs20}Oh, for a moment alone in the forest.

162
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,430
几乎一丝不挂
{\fs20}And almost naked.

163
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,850
她在绿树下会遇见谁
{\fs20}Who do you suppose she'll meet under that greenwood tree?

164
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,400
也许她与某个追求者有个约会
{\fs20}Well, perhaps she has a rendezvous with some suitor.

165
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,190
对
{\fs20}Yes!

166
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,640
王后殿下  您可曾冒险
{\fs20}Have you ever ventured into the woods

167
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,730
进入城堡外的密林
{\fs20}outside the castle, My Lady?

168
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,070
不曾  我不喜欢树林
{\fs20}No, I do not like the woods myself.

169
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,450
我可不敢
{\fs20}Oh, I would not dare.

170
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,910
真的是只身一人吗
{\fs20}Unaccompanied, indeed?

171
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,290
哈姆雷特  过来
{\fs20}Hamlet, come.

172
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,500
你喜欢吗
{\fs20}Do you like it?

173
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,960
十分逼真
{\fs20}Most lifelike.

174
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,750
完工之后会更加栩栩如生
{\fs20}When I am finished, it will be truer than life.

175
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,050
那猎人在哪里
{\fs20}Oh, where's the hunter?

176
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,090
他走了  把箭留在了那儿
{\fs20}See, he has left, his arrows there.

177
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,640
那是她的箭
{\fs20}Those are her arrows.

178
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,850
继续说  奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}Go on, Ophelia.

179
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,770
她是戴安娜  狩猎女神
{\fs20}She is Diana, goddess of the hunt.

180
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,520
她在森林里安家
{\fs20}She made her home in the forest.

181
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,470
猎人阿克泰翁是她认识的
{\fs20}She knew no man until the

182
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,820
第一个人
{\fs20}hunter Actaeon came upon her.

183
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:55,410
猎人  不是渔夫吗
{\fs20}A hunter, not a fisherman?

184
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:58,490
他藏起来偷看她洗澡
{\fs20}He hid and watched her bathe.

185
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,540
那他有受到惩罚吗
{\fs20}Was he punished for this trespass?

186
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,870
毫不留情
{\fs20}Mercilessly.

187
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,100
戴安娜把他变成一头雄鹿
{\fs20}Diana turned him into a stag

188
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,000
并让他自己的猎犬将其撕碎
{\fs20}and his own hounds tore him apart.

189
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,710
那你们认为这种惩罚合适吗
{\fs20}And do you ladies think this punishment was fit?

190
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,510
这难道不只是故事吗
{\fs20}Hasn't that ever been the story?

191
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,970
美人把男人变成野兽
{\fs20}Beauty turns men to beasts.

192
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,270
我总是会把女神想象成一个女孩
{\fs20}I'd always pictured the goddess as a girl.

193
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,900
年轻  冲动
{\fs20}You know, youthful, impulsive.

194
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,650
这个戴安娜太老了
{\fs20}Diana is too aged in this weaving.

195
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,480
她是以王后的形象描绘的
{\fs20}She is depicted as the queen,

196
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,070
你的母亲  殿下
{\fs20}your mother, My Lord.

197
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,040
真是可怜的相似之处
{\fs20}It's a wretched likeness.

198
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,370
全部拆掉  重新编织
{\fs20}Unpick your threads and begin again.

199
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:52,840
去拿她的药剂  快  跟着王后
{\fs20}Fetch her tonic. Quickly, after the queen.

200
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:02,980
她去哪了
{\fs20}Where could she be?

201
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,020
希望她回房间里去了
{\fs20}I hope she's gone to her chambers.

202
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,150
你怎么会跟丢她
{\fs20}How did you lose sight of her?

203
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,860
她可能是回房间了
{\fs20}Perhaps she's retired to her chamber.

204
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,940
快点来  我是说  真的  没关系
{\fs20}Come quick. I mean, really, it's fine.

205
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,150
嗯  她看起来一点也不老
{\fs20}Well, she doesn't look aged at all.

206
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,840
你迷路了吗
{\fs20}Have you lost your way?

207
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,890
我的年纪足够我学会认路
{\fs20}I've lived plenty long enough to know my way

208
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,430
但还没到我可以无视它的地步
{\fs20}and not yet long enough to forget it.

209
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,440
你的儿子回来了
{\fs20}Your son has returned..

210
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,730
你本该开心才对
{\fs20}...you should be all joy.

211
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,240
但我觉得你很难过
{\fs20}And, yet, I think you pine.

212
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
一位母亲是很难接受自己的儿子
{\fs20}It is difficult for a mother when her boy

213
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,960
长大成人并不再依赖她
{\fs20}becomes a man and no longer hers.

214
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:12,000
如果我是你儿子  我不会轻易忘记你
{\fs20}If I were your son, I would not soon forget you.

215
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,420
但你不是我儿子  而是我的弟弟
{\fs20}And yet you are not my son, but my brother.

216
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,720
法律上讲  我的确是你弟弟
{\fs20}In law, I am your brother.

217
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,090
但我从不喜欢法律
{\fs20}But I've never much loved the law.

218
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,560
有流言说你喜欢的东西还挺多
{\fs20}The gossips say there are many other things you love.

219
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,270
那些流言都是胡说八道
{\fs20}The gossips are mistaken.

220
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,400
但只有一件除外
{\fs20}There's only the one thing.

221
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,180
我们靠的太近了
{\fs20}It's very close in here.

222
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,720
我需要点空间
{\fs20}Perhaps I need some air.

223
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,930
每天晚上我都与你感同身受
{\fs20}I often feel as you do at night.

224
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,140
我在护栏边透气
{\fs20}I take my air on the parapets.

225
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,850
在那儿你能找到我
{\fs20}You will find me there.

226
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,440
不  我不会去的
{\fs20}No. I will not.

227
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,170
怎么了  奥菲利娅
{\fs20}How now, Ophelia?

228
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,970
有那么一瞬间我还以为你是鬼
{\fs20}For a flash I thought you were a ghost.

229
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:46,550
我们在学校解剖过人体
{\fs20}At school we dissected a corpse into his parts.

230
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,680
没有一块躯体能容得下鬼魂
{\fs20}There was no room for his ghost.

231
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,970
殿下  那我得相信你的话了
{\fs20}I shall have to take your word for it, My Lord.

232
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,690
我对人体构造一无所知
{\fs20}I know nothing of the parts of men.

233
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,110
你让我的心停止了跳动
{\fs20}You stop my heart.

234
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,490
如果你的心跳停止  你就死了
{\fs20}If your heart stopped, you would die.

235
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,370
可我好像还活着
{\fs20}I seem to be quite alive.

236
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,370
外表会骗人
{\fs20}Appearances deceive.

237
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,040
看这个
{\fs20}See this.

238
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,540
一朵纯洁的花
{\fs20}An innocent flower.

239
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:23,300
但其实这是颠茄  最致命的茄属植物
{\fs20}And yet it is belladonna, the most deadly nightshade.

240
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,800
颠茄又称美人草
{\fs20}Belladonna means beautiful woman.

241
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,230
而你说这有毒
{\fs20}And you say it is poison.

242
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,610
能答应与我共舞一曲吗
{\fs20}Will you promise to dance with me someday?

243
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,240
恐怕我跳舞像只山羊
{\fs20}I'm afraid I dance like a goat.

244
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,250
大人  你今天表现的很出色
{\fs20}You excel today, My Lord.

245
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,430
外甥  过来
{\fs20}Nephew. Come.

246
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,560
你来试试
{\fs20}Try your learning.

247
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,810
我不想伤到你
{\fs20}I would not want to wound you.

248
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:19,480
我不是你  我们就打着玩玩
{\fs20}Nor I you. We'll, uh, we'll fight in fun.

249
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,360
打斗没有乐趣可言
{\fs20}I find no fun in fighting.

250
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,820
胜者可以赢得我的丝巾
{\fs20}The winning knight shall wear my colors.

251
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:28,280
小流氓  还带着女人的东西
{\fs20}Rogue. Seems you wear a lady's colors already.

252
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,900
如果这个女孩和这个颜色一样淫荡
{\fs20}And you've chosen well

253
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,740
那你眼光不错
{\fs20}if the girl's as bawdy as her colors.

254
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,790
给我小心点
{\fs20}You watch yourself.

255
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,540
还是有点男儿血性的
{\fs20}Ah, there's hot blood in the boy after all.

256
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,010
干得漂亮  哈姆雷特
{\fs20}Well done, Hamlet.

257
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,100
精彩  哈姆雷特
{\fs20}Hamlet!

258
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,260
你嘴上争论下一步该做什么
{\fs20}You debate what to do next.

259
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,970
与此同时又无所作为
{\fs20}And, meanwhile, you do next to nothing.

260
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,610
大人  您的剑
{\fs20}Your sword, My Lord.

261
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:08,900
给你
{\fs20}Here...

262
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,500
看来我错了

你还有很多要学习
{\fs20}You have much to learn.

264
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,710
我宁愿不学剑术
{\fs20}I prefer not to learn at the point of a sword.

265
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,590
我的锋锐自在心中
{\fs20}My sharpness is within.

266
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,930
奇妙的生物

不要玩弄我
{\fs20}Do not play with me.

269

272
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,470
葡萄酒呢
{\fs20}Wine?

273
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,770
有人说共饮一杯酒
{\fs20}Some would say that's a pledge,

274
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,610
是一种誓言
{\fs20}to drink wine from the same cup.

275
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,700
我们不可以
{\fs20}We mustn't.

276
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,130
会有人找我的
{\fs20}I will be missed.

277
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:17,030
我觉得像有一根矛插进了我的耳朵
{\fs20}I feel like a lance has gone in between my ears.

278

我好像从没有这种感觉  霍拉旭
{\fs20}I don't think I've ever felt like this before, Horatio.

279
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,370
我希望没有
{\fs20}I hope you haven't.

280
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,910
早上好  女士
{\fs20}Morning, My Lady.

281
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,070
你喜欢跳舞吗

282
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,700
我喜欢夜晚
{\fs20}I enjoyed the evening.

283
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,830
黑夜和白昼
{\fs20}It's difficult to enjoy both the evening

284
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,000
难以同享
{\fs20}and the morning after.

285
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,920
谢天谢地夏天结束了
{\fs20}Uh, thank God this summer is over.

286
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,840
学习比玩耍更使我头痛
{\fs20}My studies hurt my head a little less than my leisure.

287

你要回去继续你的学业了吗

{\fs20}You'll foul your breeches, My Lord.

296
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,620
那好  再见

297
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,050
-试着理解我  -我在尝试
{\fs20}- Try to understand. - I am trying.

298
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,850
我父亲不会同意的
{\fs20}My father would never allow it.

299
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,310
他希望我有朝一日能继承他的王座
{\fs20}He wishes me someday to take his throne.

300
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,060
而我太卑贱了
{\fs20}And I am low.

301
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,610
-不  奥菲利娅  -我被你骗了
{\fs20}- No, Ophelia. - I was deceived in you.

302
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,650
现在我知道你是个王子了
{\fs20}I see now that you are but a prince.

303
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,620

308
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,220
你知道城堡下面的树林吗
{\fs20}Do you know the wood beneath the castle?

309

{\fs20}And whatever you do, do not look upon her face.

314
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,660
因为她是个女巫吗
{\fs20}Because she is a witch?

她是个医师

你想干什么
{\fs20}What do you want?

319
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,580
王后派我来的

是2盎司我的药剂
{\fs20}...is two ounces of my tonic.

328
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,240
别碰那个

我的指尖没感觉了
{\fs20}I can't feel my fingertips.

330

这是新世界的蛇毒
{\fs20}It's a snake's poison from the New World.

331
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:17,100

{\fs20}A touch of it makes the flesh numb.

332
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,010
再多一点就能毒死人

333
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,270
我能学习这些秘术吗

你是一个侍女

先学习静等吧

336
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,440
等什么
{\fs20}For what?

00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,620
等一个丈夫啊  小丫头  要不然呢

{\fs20}but the blood in his veins is impure.

346
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,350
谁没听过那个传闻
{\fs20}We've all heard that story.

347
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,560
但也没有理由相信它
{\fs20}There's no cause to believe it.

348
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,810
好吧  他是他母亲的儿子
{\fs20}Well, he's his mother's son, alright,

349
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,560

{\fs20}but there is nothing of my father in him.

350
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,020
现在你是要侮辱母亲吗

她并不比别的女人差

过了上床时间了吧

363
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,290
这里可没有给女孩子睡觉的地方
{\fs20}And up here's not a place for a girl.

真理和疯狂  又在哪

科学中有唯一解释

00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:53,370
-他们很可爱  -谢谢您  陛下
{\fs20}- They're lovely. - Thank you. Your Majesty.

389
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:54,910
这里  拿着
{\fs20}Here, take these.

390
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,710
瞧瞧你
{\fs20}Look at you.

391
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,620
你将成为我的侍女
{\fs20}You will be one of my ladies.

392
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,500
今日王后最喜欢我
{\fs20}Today the queen loves me above the rest.

393
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,130
但她很善变
{\fs20}But she is fickle..

394
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:06,670
也许哪天你又能重得恩宠了
{\fs20}...and another day you might be back in favor.

395
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:09,670
别说她善变  这话有点重了
{\fs20}Say not she is fickle. It is too much said.

396
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,150
王国需要国王
{\fs20}A kingdom needs a king

397
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,720
而国王需要妻子
{\fs20}and a king needs a wife.

398
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,890
她何须成为别的什么人
{\fs20}Why should she be anything else?

399
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:18,190
但她已经是一位国王的妻子了
{\fs20}She was already a king's wife.

400
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:23,110
我的父亲安葬了吗
{\fs20}Is my father buried?

401
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,400
早就安葬了  殿下
{\fs20}Long since, My Lord.

402
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:33,320
哈姆雷特  你这么久才回来
{\fs20}Hamlet! You were so long returning.

403
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,450
久到葬礼的花圈都被撤下来了是吗
{\fs20}So long that the funeral wreaths are already taken down?

404
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:40,870
欢迎  哈姆雷特  你回来我们很高兴
{\fs20}Welcome, Hamlet. We are most happy you are returned.

405
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:41,960
看起来太迟了
{\fs20}Too late, it seems.

406
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,540
来不及悼念你已故的父亲了
{\fs20}Too late to honor your late father.

407
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,710
看来我父亲的荣誉被玷污了
{\fs20}It seems my father's honor is much besmirched.

408
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,450
他很庄重地哀悼了
{\fs20}He grieves, commendably,

409
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:50,930
就和痛失亲父的儿子一样
{\fs20}as every son who loses a father.

410
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,340
他的父亲也曾失去父亲
{\fs20}His father lost a father once,

411
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,680
那也是我的父亲
{\fs20}who was my father also.

412
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,310
我们都像个男人一样挺了过来
{\fs20}We were ever men about it.

413
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,560
是像引诱女人以夺王冠的男人吧
{\fs20}Man indeed to seduce a woman to take a crown.

414
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,060
-哈姆雷特  -你逾越了
{\fs20}- Hamlet. - You forget yourself.

415
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:06,020
是贵族们举行的选举
{\fs20}The nobles held their election.

416
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,980
看来我是唯一一个没有忘记的人
{\fs20}I seem to be the only one present who does not forget.

417
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,240
你忘了该怎样给国王行礼
{\fs20}You forget how to greet a king!

418
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:27,460
我是你的王
{\fs20}I am your king.

419
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,550
来吧  乔特鲁德
{\fs20}Come, Gertrude.

420
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,060
我们用餐吧
{\fs20}Let us eat.

421
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,130
还给我
{\fs20}Give it back.

422
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:05,350
别玩了
{\fs20}Stop it.

423
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,270
瞧  我们抓了只野鸡
{\fs20}Look, we've caught ourselves a pheasant.

424
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,570
放开她
{\fs20}Get off her!

425
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,650
不然怎样
{\fs20}Or what?

426
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,660
来吧
{\fs20}Come on.

427
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,580
别碰我  不然你会付出代价的
{\fs20}Let me loose. You will pay for this.

428
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,190
付出什么  付钱吗
{\fs20}What? You want me to pay for it.

429
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,540
她说我得付钱
{\fs20}She wants me to pay for it!

430
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,500
放那个女的走  这位才是个真妓女
{\fs20}Let the maiden go. This one really is a whore!

431
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:40,010
闻起来像是烂透了
{\fs20}The air smells very ripe.

432
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:42,720
也许该洗个澡了
{\fs20}Perhaps a bath is in order.

433
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,890
你说什么
{\fs20}What'd you say to me? Huh?

434
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:47,810
别碰她
{\fs20}Let her be!

435
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:48,940
走开
{\fs20}Come away.

436
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,020
看出来了  你听这个娘们的
{\fs20}Mastered by a maiden I see!

437
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:56,570
我们走吧  哈姆雷特  别  我们走
{\fs20}Come away. Hamlet, no. Come away.

438
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:05,200
谢了  王子殿下  但我不需要你来救
{\fs20}Thank you, Your Highness. But I had no need of saving.

439
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,540
说到需要  是我需要你
{\fs20}You speak of need. In need I sought you.

440
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,080
我很想你  奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}I have missed you, Ophelia.

441
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,960
我应该为去年夏天的事向你道歉
{\fs20}I should apologize for my behavior to you last summer.

442
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,750
-是吗  -没错
{\fs20}- You should? - I do.

443
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:16,000
-我已经忘了  -忘了但是没有原谅
{\fs20}- It is forgotten. - Forgotten but not forgiven.

444
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,420
忘记并原谅了
{\fs20}Both.

445
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,880
我从没有忘记你
{\fs20}I have never forgotten you.

446
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,590
恕我不能相信
{\fs20}You'll forgive me if I doubt it.

447
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:26,520
水在哪  奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}Where is the water, Ophelia?

448
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:29,230
-挡住王后  -哈姆雷特
{\fs20}- Cover the queen. - Hamlet.

449
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:31,980
怎么回事
{\fs20}What is the matter?

450
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:36,030
被忘记的是这个
{\fs20}What forgetting is here?

451
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,030
哈姆雷特
{\fs20}Hamlet?

452
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,200
只是一些脏丝带
{\fs20}It is only a filthy bit of ribbon.

453
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:50,540
请把我的药剂取来
{\fs20}My tonic, please.

454
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,050
再来
{\fs20}Again.

455
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,260
再见了  妹妹
{\fs20}Farewell, sister.

456
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,970
我要去法国继续修学了
{\fs20}I'm to continue my education in France.

457
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:08,060
你要走了吗
{\fs20}You are leaving?

458
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,970
这个城堡里的氛围怪怪的
{\fs20}These are strange times in this castle.

459
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,310
确实
{\fs20}Strange indeed.

460
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,650
各种谣言满天飞
{\fs20}Rumors abound of all shapes and sizes.

461
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,480
都吓到了我
{\fs20}All of them frighten me.

462
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,570
他们说王子已经不把你当孩子看了
{\fs20}They are saying the prince no longer sees you as a child.

463
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:22,200
我确实不是孩子了
{\fs20}I am no longer a child.

464
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:23,820
奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}Ophelia..

465
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,910
你得害怕
{\fs20}...be afraid.

466
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:28,530
你要害怕他能够夺走你的一切
{\fs20}Afraid of all he can take from you.

467
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,160
只有害怕你才会安全
{\fs20}You will only be safe if you are afraid.

468
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,830
你顾好自己  我也会自行珍重的
{\fs20}Tend to your own honor and I will tend to mine.

469
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,170
雷欧提斯  快点
{\fs20}Laertes, hurry!

470
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:40,050
时间不等人啊
{\fs20}Time and tide wait for no man.

471
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,680
好了  现在
{\fs20}Now..

472
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,350
我祝福你  孩子
{\fs20}...my blessing on you, son.

473
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:53,230
记着  遇事要自己做决定
{\fs20}Now, remember, keep your own counsel.

474
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:56,400
不要轻信别人或随波逐流
{\fs20}Don't be familiar or vulgar.

475
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,500
还有不要与人争执
{\fs20}And don't fight,

476
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,820
如果不得已那就必须赢下
{\fs20}or if you do, win.

477
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:01,860
穿着要得体  但不要花太多钱打扮
{\fs20}Um, dress well. But don't spend too much.

478
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:04,360
也别借钱或借给别人
{\fs20}Don't borrow any money or lend it.

479
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,700
最重要的  忠于自己
{\fs20}And above all, be true to yourself.

480
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,080
再见了  父亲
{\fs20}Farewell, father.

481
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,290
保重  奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}And take care, Ophelia.

482
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:15,880
记住我说的话
{\fs20}Remember what I said.

483
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:22,270
他说什么了
{\fs20}What did he say?

484
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:24,920
关于哈姆雷特殿下的事
{\fs20}Something about Lord Hamlet.

485
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,970
哦对  哈姆雷特
{\fs20}Ah, yes, Hamlet.

486
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:31,430
听说他闯进了王后的寝宫
{\fs20}They say he ran into the queen's chamber

487
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:35,060
还盯着你说了些奇怪的话
{\fs20}and stared at you and spoke very strangely.

488
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,520
是的  我看见了
{\fs20}I saw it, yes.

489
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:43,110
他有没有对你示爱
{\fs20}Did he bestow on you some... sign of love?

490
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:44,780
没有
{\fs20}No.

491
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,240
你在撒谎吗  女儿
{\fs20}Are you lying to me, daughter?

492
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,990
是的
{\fs20}Yes.

493
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:52,250
撒谎说是  就等于不是
{\fs20}A lying yes is equal to a no.

494
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:54,250
那么不是
{\fs20}No.

495
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,080
所以是咯
{\fs20}So, yes?

496
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:02,500
这对我们来说可非常有利
{\fs20}This could prove very advantageous for us.

497
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:04,470
父亲  我不想和他有任何瓜葛了
{\fs20}I want nothing to do with him, father.

498
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:09,390
你是个好女孩  好的有点过分了
{\fs20}You're a very bad girl to be so good.

499
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,560
奥菲莉娅  进来
{\fs20}Ophelia. Come in.

500
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:24,030
图书馆禁止女孩出入
{\fs20}Girls are not allowed in the library..

501
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:25,490
除非她们被写进了书里
{\fs20}...unless they're in the books.

502
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:28,740
但我觉得你以前也来过  快进来吧
{\fs20}Yet I think you have been in here before. Come in.

503
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:46,420
我希望能够成为一名医师
{\fs20}I wish someday to be a healer.

504
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:48,300
医师分很多种
{\fs20}There are many different kinds of healer.

505
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,300
那么学者好了  一个懂科学的人
{\fs20}A doctor then, a man of science.

506
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,970
你知道有人为了科学去掘墓的事吗
{\fs20}You know graves are robbed for such science?

507
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:56,850
哈姆雷特很痛苦
{\fs20}Look, Hamlet is much distressed.

508
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:58,980
他对我粗暴无礼
{\fs20}He behaves wildly towards me.

509
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,940
但他的粗暴是有原因的  相信我
{\fs20}But there is a method in his madness. Trust me.

510
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,650
去找他吧  求你了
{\fs20}Go to him, please.

511
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:07,820
在哪
{\fs20}Where?

512
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:09,530
城墙上
{\fs20}The ramparts..

513
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:10,740
午夜时分
{\fs20}...at midnight.

514
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:19,080
我死了之后离我的坟墓远点
{\fs20}Stay away from my grave when I am dead.

515
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:22,380
奥菲莉娅  别想的这么晦气
{\fs20}Ophelia, do not be so morbid.

516
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,870
我可不想成为
{\fs20}I have no interest in becoming

517
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,170
某些人的解剖课教材
{\fs20}some man's anatomy lesson.

518
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:42,990
你在发抖  奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}You tremble, Ophelia.

519
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:44,690
你吓到我了  殿下
{\fs20}You frightened me, My Lord.

520
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,070
宫廷里传言这上面有个鬼魂
{\fs20}They are saying in the court there is a ghost up here.

521
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:51,570
我好像亲眼见过它一次
{\fs20}I thought I saw it once myself.

522
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,740
他们说那是我父亲不肯安息的灵魂
{\fs20}They say it is my father's unquiet spirit.

523
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:59,210
小心  有哨兵来了
{\fs20}Careful, the sentinel comes.

524
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:19,770
他们说在王后的侍女里面
{\fs20}They say of all the queen's ladies

525
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:22,230
就你知道她的密辛
{\fs20}you are the one who knows her secrets.

526
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:25,060
承认知道秘密就等于暴露了秘密
{\fs20}To say you know a secret is to tell the secret.

527
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:28,110
你只需告诉我  奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}Tell me only this, Ophelia.

528
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:30,110
我母亲有没有忠于我的父亲
{\fs20}Was my mother true to my father,

529
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:31,570
她的丈夫  一国之主
{\fs20}her husband, the king?

530
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,740
我不能跟你说
{\fs20}I cannot tell you.

531
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:40,660
但你不会撒谎
{\fs20}And yet you cannot lie.

532
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:47,500
善变啊
{\fs20}Fickle.

533
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:52,590
我母亲就像其他女人一样  善变又脆弱
{\fs20}My mother is like all women. Fickle, frail.

534
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:53,800
殿下
{\fs20}My Lord..

535
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:56,800
你这样太不公平了
{\fs20}...you are most unjust.

536
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,890
爱情中的脆弱与性别无关
{\fs20}Frailty in love is not a habit of my sex.

537
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:01,520
也许是家族传承
{\fs20}Perhaps it runs in families.

538
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:04,520
原谅我
{\fs20}Forgive me.

539
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:07,940
现在我已看透了人心
{\fs20}I see now what people are..

540
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:11,110
只有你不一样
{\fs20}...and only you are not.

541
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,320
你不是  奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}Not you, Ophelia.

542
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,950
别难过了  殿下
{\fs20}Be comforted, My Lord.

543
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,170
奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}Ophelia..

544
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:25,920
我的真爱
{\fs20}...my true love.

545
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:30,190
王后
{\fs20}The queen.

546
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:37,070
她想要药剂
{\fs20}She wants her tonic.

547
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:42,120
她想要  她想要  她要什么有什么
{\fs20}Oh, she wants, she wants, she gets what she wants.

548
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:47,040
-她不敢去感受  -那你呢
{\fs20}- She fears to feel. - And you?

549
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,750
你知道什么
{\fs20}What do you think you know?

550
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:55,050
你假装有一颗破碎的心
{\fs20}You pretend you have a broken heart.

551
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:58,800
假装很无辜  很受伤
{\fs20}That you are innocent and wounded.

552
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:03,550
但你藏不住淑女外表下的真实嘴脸
{\fs20}But you cannot hide your true self under ladies' clothes.

553
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,100
你野心很大  充满欲望
{\fs20}You are wild and full of desire.

554
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,640
他们会曝光你  审判你
{\fs20}They will strip you, they will judge you

555
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:11,570
他们会让你生不如死
{\fs20}and they will find you wanting death.

556
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:17,610
他们会把你烧死
{\fs20}They will cast you to the fire.

557
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:24,870
你知道为什么他们叫我女巫吗
{\fs20}Do you know why they call me a witch?

558
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:32,250
19岁的时候  我怀孕了
{\fs20}At 19, I was with child

559
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:35,920
孩子的父亲发誓会娶我
{\fs20}by a man who swore he'd marry me.

560
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,460
当我的孩子胎死腹中时
{\fs20}When my baby died inside me

561
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:42,630
漫天谣言说这是恶魔所为
{\fs20}rumors spread it was the devil's work.

562
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:46,220
正义的人们站出来说要赶走恶魔
{\fs20}The righteous came to cast the devil out.

563
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:49,220
烧死她
{\fs20}Burn her!

564
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:51,310
但他们不知道的是
{\fs20}But they didn't know..

565
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:53,650
我了解毒药
{\fs20}...I knew my poisons.

566
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,970
在舌头上滴三滴
{\fs20}Three drops on the tongue,

567
00:51:56,970 --> 00:51:59,320
就能让人陷入假死
{\fs20}the venom mimics death but mocks it.

568
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,820
烧死那个巫婆
{\fs20}Burn the witch!

569
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,320
他们以为我死了
{\fs20}They thought me dead.

570
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:06,540
你喝了毒药却没死
{\fs20}You drank the venom but didn't die?

571
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:14,460
他们扔掉了我的尸体
{\fs20}They found my corpse, threw me away

572
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:16,920
并称恶魔被击败了
{\fs20}and declared the devil vanquished.

573
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:23,930
我带了解药得以存活
{\fs20}I had my remedy laid by and so I lived.

574
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:26,810
但救不回我的儿子
{\fs20}But without my son.

575
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:32,150
那他的父亲怎么样了
{\fs20}And what of his father?

576
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:39,780
他最近结婚了
{\fs20}He was quite recently married.

577
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:08,930
奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}Ophelia.

578
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,270
奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}Ophelia.

579
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:30,240
向我坦白  你灵魂的守护者
{\fs20}Confess to me, the keeper of your soul.

580
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:31,830
你爱着别人吗
{\fs20}Do you love another?

581
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:35,710
我只爱你
{\fs20}I love only you.

582
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:41,550
那么明早在湖边的旧教堂等我
{\fs20}Then meet me tomorrow at the old chapel by the lake.

583
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:44,470
把自己打扮成乡下姑娘
{\fs20}Disguise yourself as a country lass.

584
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:45,760
你是牧羊人吗
{\fs20}And you a shepherd?

585
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:51,600
会有人说闲话的  恐怕已经在说了
{\fs20}There will be talk. I fear there is already.

586
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,930
让他们说吧
{\fs20}Let them talk.

587
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,730
奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}Ophelia..

588
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,070
我想娶你
{\fs20}...I want to marry you.

589
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:06,760
他们不会允许的
{\fs20}They will never allow it!

590
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,450
奥菲莉娅  他们不会知道的
{\fs20}Ophelia, they will not know.

591
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:10,780
但丹麦理应是属于你的
{\fs20}But all of Denmark should be yours.

592
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:12,700
只要你能在我身边
{\fs20}If you were beside me, I would take grass

593
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:14,910
我宁愿不做丹麦的王
{\fs20}over Denmark's gilded throne.

594
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:19,540
到那时我们可以双宿双飞
{\fs20}When the time comes we will go away from here.

595
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,090
我良人对我说
{\fs20}"My beloved spake, and said unto me

596
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:36,270
起来  我的佳偶  与我同去
{\fs20}"rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.

597
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:39,270
愿他用口与我亲吻
{\fs20}"Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth..

598
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:42,070
因你的爱比酒更美
{\fs20}"...for his love is better than wine.

599
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:45,570
良人属于我  我也属于他
{\fs20}"My beloved is mine and I am his.

600
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:46,780
看呐
{\fs20}"Behold..

601
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:48,740
我的佳偶汝甚美丽
{\fs20}"...thou art fair, my love

602
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:51,080
你的双眸好似鸽子的眼
{\fs20}"thou hast doves' eyes.

603
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:53,780
看呐
{\fs20}"Behold..

604
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,960
我的佳偶汝甚美丽
{\fs20}"...thou art fair, my beloved..

605
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:00,790
我们以青草为床榻
{\fs20}"...and also our bed is green.

606
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:05,880
因为冬天已往  雨水不再
{\fs20}"For, lo, the winter is past, and the rain is over and gone.

607
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,010
地上百花繁茂
{\fs20}"Flowers appear on the earth.

608
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:11,760
求你将我放你心上烙印
{\fs20}"Set me as a seal on your heart

609
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,810
因为爱情比死亡坚韧
{\fs20}for love is stronger than death."

610
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,820
早上好  夫人
{\fs20}Good morning, My Lady.

611
00:56:57,950 --> 00:56:59,740
你起得真早
{\fs20}You're up early.

612
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,750
还是说你整晚没睡
{\fs20}Or were you up all night?

613
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,430
我听说你在乡下
{\fs20}I'm told you spend your days

614
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:17,140
和一个平民男孩在一起
{\fs20}in the country with a common boy..

615
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:19,270
你还穿得像农夫家的女儿
{\fs20}...dressed like a farmer's daughter.

616
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,140
你承认了
{\fs20}You don't deny it?

617
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:30,440
你对我的回报就是羞辱自己吗
{\fs20}You repay my kindness by disgracing yourself?

618
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,200
没必要让自己变得更加卑贱
{\fs20}No need to make yourself lower than you already are.

619
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:39,030
你回来了
{\fs20}There you are.

620
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:40,330
早上好
{\fs20}Good morning.

621
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:49,300
-我要的东西呢  -这里
{\fs20}- Do you have what I need? - I do.

622
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:04,770
你还看着干什么
{\fs20}Why do you stare?

623
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:06,980
你看起来像见了鬼一样
{\fs20}You look like you've seen a ghost.

624
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:11,270
出去吧  奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}Leave us, Ophelia.

625
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,670
你在干什么
{\fs20}What keeps you?

626
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:32,050
陛下  您的披风破了
{\fs20}Your cloak is torn, Your Majesty.

627
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,010
也许我可以修补一下
{\fs20}Perhaps I could mend it for you?

628
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:42,850
快吗
{\fs20}Are you fast?

629
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:46,560
陛下  您是说我的针线活吗
{\fs20}You mean my stitches,  Your Majesty?

630
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:49,360
奥菲莉娅  你知道我在说什么
{\fs20}I think you know what I mean, Ophelia.

631
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:56,530
我的侄子最近很奇怪
{\fs20}My nephew has been very strange of late.

632
00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:59,070
他晚上经常在走廊里走来走去
{\fs20}He haunts the corridors at night.

633
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:00,660
你知道为什么吗
{\fs20}Do you know the cause of that?

634
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:04,540
也许你知道该怎么办
{\fs20}Maybe you know the cure.

635
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:10,460
或许就是因为你  也只有你能解决
{\fs20}Perhaps you are the cause and the cure.

636
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:16,180
你父亲说我的侄子
{\fs20}Your father says that my nephew is

637
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:18,380
爱上你了  是吗
{\fs20}in love with you. Is it so?

638
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:21,550
我父亲告诉我不要痴心妄想
{\fs20}Hm, my father told me it could not be so.

639
00:59:21,550 --> 00:59:26,230
-他说过爱你吗  -从来没有  陛下
{\fs20}- Has he said he loves you? - Never, Your Majesty.

640
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:29,730
他有给过你定情信物吗
{\fs20}Has he given you a token of his love?

641
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:30,810
从来没有
{\fs20}Never.

642
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:40,900
他们是无意的  陛下
{\fs20}It was all done in innocence, Your Majesty.

643
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:43,070
如果有什么  那也只是小孩子过家家
{\fs20}If I know what I know, they're just children at play!

644
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,410
你之前可不是这么说的
{\fs20}You said something quite different before.

645
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:48,620
我仔细想了想这些事情
{\fs20}I have re-thought myself, and other things.

646
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:53,250
我一直担心哈姆雷特的精神状态
{\fs20}I have been worried about Hamlet's state of mind.

647
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,340
正好她可以派上用场
{\fs20}Here is the bait for him.

648
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:02,890
等着瞧
{\fs20}Now, we shall see.

649
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:45,510
宁芙女神
{\fs20}Nymph!

650
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,560
你的水呢
{\fs20}Where is your water?

651
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,520
殿下  有些事我想告诉你
{\fs20}My Lord, there is much I need to tell you.

652
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,480
为什么这样称呼你的丈夫
{\fs20}Wh... what way is that to greet your husband?

653
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,190
-不  -你不是我妻子吗
{\fs20}- None. - Are you not my wife?

654
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:56,600
殿下  您玩的这个游戏
{\fs20}These games you play, My Lord,

655
01:00:56,610 --> 01:00:57,820
只是水月镜花
{\fs20}nothing is ever as it seems.

656
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,240
有样东西我想还给你
{\fs20}I have a remembrance  I wish to return to you.

657
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:06,450
我什么也没给你
{\fs20}I gave you nothing. I took.

658
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:08,830
你父亲被下毒了  这是真的
{\fs20}Your father was poisoned. It is true.

659
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:11,790
我曾看见你叔叔出现在制毒的地方
{\fs20}I once saw your uncle at a place where poisons are made.

660
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:13,290
我当时没认出来
{\fs20}I did not recognize him then

661
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:15,500
但我在城墙上又看到了他  乔装打扮
{\fs20}but I saw him again on the ramparts, disguised

662
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:19,500
就在你父亲  国王  被害的那天
{\fs20}the very day your father, the king, was stung.

663
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:22,880
所以
{\fs20}So it..

664
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:26,840
所以不是蛇
{\fs20}...so it was no snake

665
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:27,850
是克劳狄斯
{\fs20}but Claudius.

666
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,430
我必须拒绝您的殷勤
{\fs20}I must repulse your attentions

667
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:31,430
殿下  这是不允许的
{\fs20}My Lord, they have been forbidden.

668
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:36,190
你确定你说的是真的
{\fs20}Are you sure what you say is true?

669
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:39,150
我今早在他的披风里找到了毒药
{\fs20}I found the poison in his cloak this very morning.

670
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:44,950
那他便偷走了我的王位
{\fs20}Then he has stolen my crown from me.

671
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:48,280
你说过你不想要王位
{\fs20}Y... y... you said you did not want the crown.

672
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,500
我们结婚的时候你发过誓
{\fs20}You forswore it when you married me.

673
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:54,000
但我不知道它是被偷走的
{\fs20}I did not know it had been stolen.

674
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,630
哭出来  假装我把你吓到了
{\fs20}Cry out as if I frighten you.

675
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:03,790
上帝帮帮他  仁慈的主
{\fs20}God help him, merciful Lord!

676
01:02:03,790 --> 01:02:05,130
他们说我疯了
{\fs20}They say I am mad!

677
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:07,010
他们说你爱我爱到疯狂
{\fs20}Mad with love, they say, of me.

678
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:09,550
那我就发疯
{\fs20}Then I will be mad!

679
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,050
他们不会看见我来了
{\fs20}And they will not see me coming.

680
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,140
我不懂
{\fs20}I don't understand your meaning.

681
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:13,890
你不需要理解
{\fs20}You should not know what I mean.

682
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,270
只要保持纯洁如雪
{\fs20}Remain innocent as snow.

683
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:20,820
哭出来
{\fs20}Cry out.

684
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:24,070
哭
{\fs20}Cry out.

685
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:26,820
上帝保佑你
{\fs20}God help you, sir.

686
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,200
你面临着巨大的危险
{\fs20}The danger for you is very great.

687
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:35,750
你必须离开这里
{\fs20}We must get you away from here.

688
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:37,370
圣埃米里翁有一座修道院
{\fs20}There is a convent in St. Emilion

689
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:39,710
我母亲年轻时在那里住过
{\fs20}where my mother lived as a girl.

690
01:02:39,710 --> 01:02:41,040
你和修女呆在一起会很安全
{\fs20}You will be safe among the nuns.

691
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:42,500
哈姆雷特  你不能这样做
{\fs20}Hamlet, you cannot do this!

692
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:43,510
去修道院
{\fs20}Go to the nunnery!

693
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:49,300
去
{\fs20}Go!

694
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:58,150
他好像
{\fs20}He seems..

695
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,400
疯了
{\fs20}...mad.

696
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:05,440
我觉得你女儿有危险
{\fs20}I think your daughter is dangerous.

697
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,570
她应该成婚
{\fs20}She should be married

698
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:12,540
越快越好
{\fs20}as soon as possible.

699
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,040
我的护卫会照我说的做
{\fs20}I know a guard who will do my will.

700
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:27,970
你好  哈姆雷特殿下
{\fs20}Greetings, Lord Hamlet.

701
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:31,800
亲爱的  你在和谁打招呼
{\fs20}Who are you greeting, my love?

702
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,640
哈姆雷特殿下
{\fs20}Lord Hamlet!

703
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,510
-请过来  -这里
{\fs20}- Please, come in! - Hey!

704
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,600
所有人  来这里
{\fs20}Everyone, come in.

705
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:48,150
会有报应的  霍拉旭
{\fs20}This will settle it, Horatio.

706
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:49,780
通奸  谋杀  背叛
{\fs20}Adultery, murder, treachery!

707
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:51,250
这都是他的罪行
{\fs20}These are his crimes!

708
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:53,030
不  殿下  您不能去
{\fs20}No! My Lord, you can't go.

709
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:54,490
她不该在这
{\fs20}She should not be here!

710
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:56,960
他在那
{\fs20}There he is!

711
01:03:58,170 --> 01:04:00,500
他是来向我卖鱼的
{\fs20}He's come to sell me a fish!

712
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,710
我不是卖鱼的  殿下
{\fs20}I am no fish-seller, My Lord.

713
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:04,670
多可爱的鱼啊
{\fs20}But what a lovely fish it is.

714
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:08,340
哈姆雷特  过来坐我旁边
{\fs20}Hamlet! Come sit by me.

715
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:10,010
如果遇上更曼妙的美人  母亲
{\fs20}What if there was someone prettier, mother

716
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:11,680
我会选择和谁坐一起呢
{\fs20}who I would rather sit on?

717
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:16,260
殿下  不要躺地上  请起来
{\fs20}Do not lie there, My Lord. Get up.

718
01:04:16,270 --> 01:04:18,060
我能躺在哪
{\fs20}Well, where can I lie?

719
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:19,270
能躺在你的大腿上吗
{\fs20}Can I lie in your lap?

720
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:21,190
-不  殿下  -我是指枕在你的膝上
{\fs20}- No, My Lord. - I mean my head in your lap.

721
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,980
殿下  你醉了
{\fs20}You are merry, My Lord.

722
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:25,190
结婚  是啊
{\fs20}Married? Indeed!

723
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:27,230
你应该知道
{\fs20}You should know!

724
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:28,440
我母亲也结婚了
{\fs20}My mother was married,

725
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,360
几个小时前刚丧偶
{\fs20}and she was widowed only hours ago.

726
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:33,160
别乱说话  别乱发疯
{\fs20}Hold your tongue and master this madness.

727
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:35,030
他们想让我嫁人
{\fs20}They want me to marry another.

728
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:39,540
如果必须这么做  你就嫁给一个笨蛋
{\fs20}If you must marry, marry a fool.

729
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,500
我曾认识一个笨蛋
{\fs20}I knew a fool once.

730
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:45,790
他叫约里克
{\fs20}His name was Yorick.

731
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:48,000
他愚弄了国王的兄弟
{\fs20}He made a fool of the king's brother.

732
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:49,510
我见过他
{\fs20}I saw him once.

733
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:50,720
他在逗国王笑
{\fs20}He made the king laugh.

734
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,880
就在那天晚上  他牺牲了
{\fs20}And paid with his life that very same night.

735
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,970
真是个悲伤的故事
{\fs20}'Tis a very sad story indeed.

736
01:04:58,020 --> 01:04:59,940
还有一个更悲伤的  奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}I know a sadder one, Ophelia.

737
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,270
现在上演
{\fs20}It starts now.

738
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:44,100
我说过让你去修道院
{\fs20}I told you to get to the nunnery.

739
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:00,350
灯
{\fs20}A light.

740
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:03,180
灯
{\fs20}A light.

741
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:08,270
-点灯  -这只是个表演
{\fs20}- Let there be light! - It is a mere spectacle!

742
01:07:08,270 --> 01:07:10,520
你们最好给我停下  别逼我亲自动手
{\fs20}You end this now, or I will end it myself!

743
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,230
别人在看我们的笑话
{\fs20}You are making us the spectacle!

744
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:16,320
把他们轰出来  绞死他们
{\fs20}You take them all out and have them hanged!

745
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:21,200
我是你们的国王
{\fs20}I am your king!

746
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,040
国王知道这场表演是真的
{\fs20}The king knows the play is true.

747
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:25,540
我要复仇
{\fs20}Vengeance is mine.

748
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:27,540
要快 就现在
{\fs20}Swift, now.

749
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:29,460
哈姆雷特  住手
{\fs20}Hamlet! No.

750
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,220
以国王取乐
{\fs20}'Tis treason..

751
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,310
是叛国行为
{\fs20}...to draw on the king.

752
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:02,570
护卫
{\fs20}Call the guards!

753
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:04,580
把他们押上绞架
{\fs20}Take them to the gallows!

754
01:08:12,710 --> 01:08:14,960
我曾以为你的爱人太卑贱
{\fs20}I thought your lover was too low.

755
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,210
不曾想他如此高贵
{\fs20}But I see he's too high.

756
01:08:17,210 --> 01:08:20,550
您是第一个明白的人
{\fs20}You are first among those who might understand.

757
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:22,630
我可以算是你的母亲
{\fs20}I was a mother to you

758
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,300
但你却让我的儿子背叛我
{\fs20}and you turned my son against me.

759
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:26,760
原谅我
{\fs20}Forgive me.

760
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:29,390
夫人  是您把我抚养大的
{\fs20}My Lady, you raised me.

761
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,400
你太叛逆了
{\fs20}I think you protest too much.

762
01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:36,480
你不知道疼爱儿子是什么滋味
{\fs20}You cannot know what it is to love a son.

763
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:40,950
我知道爱您的儿子是什么滋味
{\fs20}I know what it is to love yours.

764
01:08:45,490 --> 01:08:47,580
你离他远点
{\fs20}You stay away from him.

765
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:50,500
别再让我看到你
{\fs20}And stay out of my sight!

766
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:55,580
我们前途尽毁了
{\fs20}We are ruined!

767
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,750
王后遣散了你
{\fs20}The queen has dismissed you

768
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:01,300
我也不会好到哪儿去
{\fs20}and I will probably follow.

769
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:02,880
如果能促成你的婚姻
{\fs20}If we can still get you married

770
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:03,970
你还能少点危险
{\fs20}you'll be less of a threat.

771
01:09:03,970 --> 01:09:06,220
-什么  -就明天  不能再等了
{\fs20}- What? - Tomorrow and not soon enough.

772
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:08,720
不要  我会受不了的
{\fs20}Please, no. I cannot bear it.

773
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:12,190
我们的新国王嗜血好杀
{\fs20}Our new king is baying for blood.

774
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:15,100
我是为了能够活下去
{\fs20}I am just trying to survive.

775
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:16,480
只是生存还远远不够
{\fs20}Survival isn't enough.

776
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:21,610
你真像你母亲
{\fs20}You are so like your mother.

777
01:09:21,610 --> 01:09:23,400
命中注定
{\fs20}No arrangement there.

778
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:24,740
你爱她
{\fs20}You loved her.

779
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:28,410
我会向王后求情
{\fs20}I will speak to the queen.

780
01:09:28,410 --> 01:09:30,830
请求她的原谅
{\fs20}And I will beg her forgiveness.

781
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:00,690
父亲
{\fs20}Father?

782
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:05,990
霍拉旭  你看起来忧心忡忡
{\fs20}Horatio, you look fraught.

783
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:07,370
你来这做什么
{\fs20}What are you doing here?

784
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,870
和哈姆雷特有关吗
{\fs20}Is it Hamlet?

785
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:11,450
不是  哈姆雷特还活着
{\fs20}No, Hamlet lives.

786
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:16,120
你的父亲死了
{\fs20}Your father was killed.

787
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:18,190
不是  是哈姆雷特的父亲死了
{\fs20}Not mine. Hamlet's?

788
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:19,380
不  是你的父亲
{\fs20}No, yours.

789
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:20,300
波洛尼厄斯大人
{\fs20}My Lord Polonius.

790
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:24,130
原谅我
{\fs20}Forgive me!

791
01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:26,220
原谅我  奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}Forgive me, Ophelia!

792
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:28,220
哈姆雷特真的疯了
{\fs20}Hamlet is mad indeed!

793
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:30,140
他以为你父亲是他的叔叔
{\fs20}He thought it was his uncle.

794
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:31,600
他拔出了剑
{\fs20}He drew his sword

795
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:36,900
我还没来得及说  藏起来的人是谁
{\fs20}before I could say...who was hidden.

796
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,440
那是个意外
{\fs20}It was an accident.

797
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,150
不是哈姆雷特的错  是我的错
{\fs20}Not Hamlet's fault, but mine.

798
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:19,770
哈姆雷特在哪儿
{\fs20}Where is Hamlet?

799
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:22,780
走了
{\fs20}Gone.

800
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,400
走了
{\fs20}Gone?

801
01:11:27,110 --> 01:11:29,110
去英国了
{\fs20}To England.

802
01:11:29,110 --> 01:11:30,740
罗森格兰兹和吉尔登斯吞和他一起走了
{\fs20}With Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

803
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:33,370
国王下的命令
{\fs20}King's orders.

804
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:35,710
为了他的安全着想
{\fs20}For his own safety.

805
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:40,460
国王可真体贴
{\fs20}It's good of the king to think of his safety.

806
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,800
这是在伤害你的感情  奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}To hurt you, Ophelia.

807
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:47,800
你不知道他有多痛苦
{\fs20}You cannot imagine his anguish.

808
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:56,770
-我父亲在哪儿  -把门关上
{\fs20}- Where is my father? - Man the gates!

809
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:58,270
他在哪里
{\fs20}Where is he?

810
01:11:58,270 --> 01:12:00,230
谁杀了我父亲
{\fs20}Who murdered my father?

811
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:02,150
我会报仇的
{\fs20}I will have justice.

812
01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:03,820
以眼还眼
{\fs20}An eye for an eye.

813
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:06,360
以牙还牙  到底是谁杀了我父亲
{\fs20}An eye for an eye! Who murdered my father?

814
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,490
冷静一点
{\fs20}Be calm.

815
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,950
为他报仇的想法是对的
{\fs20}It is right and good to want to avenge his killing.

816
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:14,330
-但他并不是我杀死的  -那是谁
{\fs20}- But he did not die by my hand. - Then whose?

817
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:15,290
哈姆雷特
{\fs20}Hamlet.

818
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:18,660
那我会手刃哈姆雷特
{\fs20}Then Hamlet will die at my hand.

819
01:12:18,670 --> 01:12:19,960
不  雷欧提斯
{\fs20}No, Laertes.

820
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,830
那是个误会
{\fs20}It was all a mistake.

821
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,920
你现在得为你的妹妹考虑
{\fs20}You must think of your sister now.

822
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:31,510
-带我去见她  -我会派人去接她
{\fs20}- Take me to her. - I will send for her.

823
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:33,010
-开门  -来吧
{\fs20}- Open the gate! - Come.

824
01:12:33,010 --> 01:12:34,720
有很多事情要告诉你
{\fs20}There is much to tell you.

825
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:40,730
幸好你今天成婚
{\fs20}Good thing you are getting married today.

826
01:12:40,730 --> 01:12:43,020
你已经胖得像头母牛了
{\fs20}You're already fat as a cow.

827
01:12:45,770 --> 01:12:47,980
你真走运能找到这么一个家徒四壁
{\fs20}You're lucky to find a husband at all with no fortune

828
01:12:47,990 --> 01:12:50,570
孤苦伶仃又恬不知耻的丈夫
{\fs20}no family and no virtue left.

829
01:12:55,450 --> 01:12:57,240
希望你不会一直点着根蜡烛
{\fs20}I hope you're not still keeping a candle lit

830
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:59,210
给你的王子爱人
{\fs20}for your lover, the prince.

831
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:02,000
一支蜡烛是不够的
{\fs20}One candle would not be enough.

832
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:05,790
即使他不在了吗
{\fs20}Even if he ceased to be at all?

833
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,880
如果他死了  我也会去死
{\fs20}If he dies then I die as well.

834
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:12,260
你不是还活着吗
{\fs20}You seem alive to me.

835
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:15,220
活着
{\fs20}Alive

836
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:16,850
但已经结婚了
{\fs20}but married.

837
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:19,140
和哈姆雷特吗
{\fs20}To Hamlet?

838
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:25,980
那你就是个寡妇了
{\fs20}Then you are a widow.

839
01:13:29,150 --> 01:13:31,070
哈姆雷特已经死了
{\fs20}Hamlet is dead already.

840
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:35,740
罗森格兰兹和吉尔登斯吞被派走了
{\fs20}My Rosencrantz and Guildenstern were sent with him.

841
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:38,830
他们不得不从
{\fs20}They did not like their orders, but they obeyed the king.

842
01:13:41,330 --> 01:13:43,370
国王让他们做了什么
{\fs20}What did the king tell them to do?

843
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:45,000
我不会说的
{\fs20}I will not tell!

844
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,500
告诉我
{\fs20}Tell me.

845
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:52,050
把她带走  她疯了
{\fs20}Get her away! She's mad.

846
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:58,100
告诉我  否则我发誓
{\fs20}Tell me or I swear..

847
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:01,890
船一离开港口
{\fs20}The minute the ship left port

848
01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:03,850
他们就会把他扔进水里
{\fs20}they were to throw him overboard.

849
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:08,440
他们昨晚就启航了
{\fs20}And they sailed last night.

850
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:05,500
奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}Ophelia.

851
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:08,500
哈姆雷特死了  霍拉旭
{\fs20}Hamlet is dead, Horatio.

852
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:10,630
死了
{\fs20}Dead?

853
01:15:10,630 --> 01:15:13,210
罗森格兰兹和吉尔登斯吞接到命令
{\fs20}Rosencrantz and Guildenstern had orders to betray him

854
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:14,760
船一离港就杀了他
{\fs20}when the ship sailed.

855
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,300
港口上没有风
{\fs20}The harbor is becalmed.

856
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:17,720
船还停在那里
{\fs20}The ship still rests there.

857
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:19,680
他们没有走
{\fs20}It has not left.

858
01:15:26,190 --> 01:15:28,940
那他还活着  霍拉旭  我们还能救他
{\fs20}Then he lives? Horatio, we can still save him.

859
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:29,860
-我  -霍拉旭
{\fs20}- I... - Horatio.

860
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:34,030
国王召见你
{\fs20}The king requires you.

861
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,400
你有见到我的新娘奥菲莉娅吗
{\fs20}Have you seen my bride, Ophelia?

862
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:36,650
没有  没见过
{\fs20}No. Not of late.

863
01:15:36,650 --> 01:15:37,740
整个城堡的人都在找她
{\fs20}The whole castle searches for her.

864
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:39,200
国王发怒了 让他们把大门关上
{\fs20}The king bay them lock the gates.

865
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:41,070
我上一次见到她时  她身体不太舒服
{\fs20}The last of I saw of her, she was unwell.

866
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:43,200
国王下令不许任何人出入
{\fs20}The king has ordered that no one leave or enter.

867
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:03,350
知道吗  王后以为你失心疯
{\fs20}You see, the queen thinks that you've lost your wits

868
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:05,220
但我觉得你的心智
{\fs20}but I think your wits are the one thing

869
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:07,560
是你仅剩下的东西
{\fs20}you still have about you.

870
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:08,560
不
{\fs20}No!

871
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,940
没有人会怀念你
{\fs20}No-one is going to miss you.

872
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:15,570
无论是父亲  兄弟  还是丈夫
{\fs20}No father, no brother, no husband.

873
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:18,530
没错
{\fs20}Yes.

874
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:20,410
我们找到了一位村里的老牧师
{\fs20}We found an old village priest

875
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:22,570
稍加说服了一下
{\fs20}who, with a little persuasion

876
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:25,240
他就告诉我们一个很奇怪的故事
{\fs20}had a very strange tale to tell.

877
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:27,960
他说你成婚了
{\fs20}He says that you have a husband.

878
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:33,590
他就是为你们主持仪式的人
{\fs20}And that he himself made you a wife.

879
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:39,970
如果你是我的孩子
{\fs20}Now, if you were my child..

880
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:42,930
你唯一的孩子在他出生前就死了
{\fs20}Your only child died before he drew breath.

881
01:16:44,430 --> 01:16:45,640
没错  你的儿子
{\fs20}Yes, a son.

882
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:50,150
他们称那个女人是女巫并烧死了她
{\fs20}They called his mother a witch and made to burn her.

883
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,320
而你早就知道了
{\fs20}But you know so already.

884
01:16:55,610 --> 01:16:58,440
是你煽风点火
{\fs20}It was you that cried witchcraft.

885
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:00,540
是你煽动整个村子
{\fs20}It was you that turned the village against

886
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:01,740
仇视那个爱你的女人
{\fs20}the woman who loved you.

887
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,290
大人  我们听到尖叫声
{\fs20}My Lord, we heard a cry.

888
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:17,960
你的新娘
{\fs20}Your bride

889
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:19,670
很难对付
{\fs20}is more than a handful.

890
01:17:19,670 --> 01:17:21,630
今天是我们的婚礼  大人
{\fs20}Our wedding is today, Your Majesty.

891
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:25,010
你不会想和一个叛徒结婚的
{\fs20}You will not want to marry a traitor.

892
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:33,310
出去
{\fs20}Leave us.

893
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:45,990
你不敢伤害我
{\fs20}You dare not harm me.

894
01:17:45,990 --> 01:17:48,580
国王怀疑你犯了叛国罪
{\fs20}The king suspects you of treason.

895
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:50,660
对叛国罪的惩罚是众所周知的
{\fs20}Punishment for treason is well known.

896
01:17:51,870 --> 01:17:53,000
是死刑
{\fs20}It is death.

897
01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:55,380
真可惜
{\fs20}What a waste.

898
01:17:57,130 --> 01:17:58,280
或许你可以
{\fs20}Perhaps you could take me

899
01:17:58,280 --> 01:17:59,750
把我扔在树林里不管
{\fs20}to the woods and leave me there.

900
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,510
国王永远不会知道
{\fs20}The king would never know.

901
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:35,880
你父亲是个好人
{\fs20}He was a good man, your father.

902
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:39,630
但你远胜于他
{\fs20}But you are twice him, I think.

903
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:13,580
和我一起唱吧  雷欧提斯
{\fs20}Sing with me, Laertes.

904
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:22,170
亲爱的妹妹  过来
{\fs20}My sweet sister, come.

905
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:25,090
坐下  安分一点
{\fs20}Sit. Be still.

906
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:55,830
这是迷迭香  象征回忆
{\fs20}Here's rosemary, for remembrance.

907
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:57,460
希望你记住
{\fs20}I hope you remember.

908
01:19:59,630 --> 01:20:01,800
三色堇  象征思念
{\fs20}Pansies for your thoughts.

909
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:07,800
芸香  象征遗憾
{\fs20}Rue... for your regrets

910
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,630
和亲情
{\fs20}and your sisters.

911
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:11,510
有一些是留给我的
{\fs20}And some for me and mine.

912
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:16,480
雏菊  是白昼的眼睛
{\fs20}Daisies. The day's eye.

913
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:18,600
都在看着
{\fs20}All seeing.

914
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:21,110
有人在看着你
{\fs20}Someone sees you.

915
01:20:28,150 --> 01:20:29,320
我本想给你一些紫罗兰
{\fs20}I'd give you some violets

916
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:31,990
但我父亲死后  它们都枯萎了
{\fs20}but they all withered when my father died.

917
01:20:34,450 --> 01:20:36,660
忠诚的霍拉旭  你会来我的坟墓吗
{\fs20}Faithful Horatio, will you visit my grave?

918
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:37,530
奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}Ophelia.

919
01:20:37,530 --> 01:20:39,960
在我的尸体冰冷前见我最后一面
{\fs20}Visit me before I am cold.

920
01:20:44,630 --> 01:20:46,040
记得把我的尸体挖出来
{\fs20}Be sure to dig me up

921
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:49,180
你可以上一堂很好的解剖课
{\fs20}and I promise you will get an excellent anatomy lesson.

922
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:01,730
这是茴香
{\fs20}Here's fennel..

923
01:21:02,730 --> 01:21:03,860
给你的
{\fs20}...for you.

924
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,030
还有耧斗花
{\fs20}And columbines..

925
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:11,910
象征谄媚
{\fs20}...for flattery.

926
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:14,410
我父亲一走就没人像他这么会拍马屁了
{\fs20}You'll miss it now my father's gone.

927
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:22,000
将她拿下
{\fs20}Take her.

928
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:26,540
♪ 留下吧  否则我将快乐不再 ♪
{\fs20}♪ Stay or else my joys will die... ♪

929
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:29,210
快拿下她
{\fs20}Take her!

930
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:33,300
-放开她  -让她去吧
{\fs20}- Unhand her! - Let her be!

931
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:35,550
这可怜的小东西快疯了
{\fs20}The poor thing has gone mad.

932
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:36,850
让她去吧
{\fs20}Let her be!

933
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:46,400
让她离开我的视线
{\fs20}Get her out of my sight.

934
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,490
-你跟着她  -是  陛下
{\fs20}- You follow her. - Yes, Sire.

935
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:04,920
坐下
{\fs20}Sit.

936
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:06,460
吃
{\fs20}Eat.

937
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:10,630
我不饿了
{\fs20}I am no longer hungry.

938
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:45,790
毒药啊  请手下留情
{\fs20}Oh, venom, be merciful.

939
01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:02,600
奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}Ophelia!

940
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:43,450
霍拉旭
{\fs20}Horatio!

941
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:44,740
哈姆雷特在哪里
{\fs20}Where is Hamlet?

942
01:24:45,950 --> 01:24:47,620
我照你说的把你挖出来了
{\fs20}I dug you up as you commanded.

943
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:56,010
我喝了能让人假死的毒药
{\fs20}I took a venom that mimics death but mocks it.

944
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:04,430
哈姆雷特在哪里
{\fs20}Where is Hamlet?

945
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:06,430
我们在他的船开航前马上走
{\fs20}Swiftly, to his ship before it sails.

946
01:25:06,430 --> 01:25:08,100
我不太舒服  霍拉旭
{\fs20}I'm not well, Horatio.

947
01:25:14,110 --> 01:25:15,570
那些人是谁
{\fs20}What is that?

948
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:24,700
那些是侦察兵
{\fs20}There are scouts about.

949
01:25:27,290 --> 01:25:29,660
是挪威来的敌人
{\fs20}It's our enemies from Norway.

950
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:31,540
他们在向城堡进军
{\fs20}They're advancing on the castle.

951
01:25:33,290 --> 01:25:35,460
你必须去警告皇室
{\fs20}You must warn the court.

952
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:36,920
我不会离开你的
{\fs20}I will not leave you.

953
01:25:38,090 --> 01:25:40,380
你必须警告他们  霍拉旭
{\fs20}You must warn them, Horatio.

954
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:41,760
去吧
{\fs20}Go.

955
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,220
我一个人去
{\fs20}I will go on alone.

956
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,100
奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}Ophelia...

957
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:48,140
再见
{\fs20}...farewell.

958
01:26:04,740 --> 01:26:07,080
我要死了  把解药给我
{\fs20}I am dying. Give me the remedy.

959
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:11,750
-你喝了毒药  -可能喝多了  拜托
{\fs20}- You took the venom? - Too much, I fear. Please.

960
01:26:15,590 --> 01:26:17,420
树林里全是士兵
{\fs20}The wood is full of soldiers.

961
01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:19,040
什么士兵
{\fs20}Soldiers?

962
01:26:19,050 --> 01:26:21,170
简直雪上加霜  喝吧
{\fs20}Worse still. Drink.

963
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:29,390
现在快走吧
{\fs20}Now be gone.

964
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:34,600
我保住了你的秘密
{\fs20}I have kept your secret.

965
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:38,150
克劳狄斯来找过你
{\fs20}Claudius came to you.

966
01:26:39,020 --> 01:26:41,650
你帮他谋杀了国王
{\fs20}You helped him murder a king.

967
01:26:43,530 --> 01:26:44,990
他自己杀的
{\fs20}He helped himself.

968
01:26:46,490 --> 01:26:48,410
我不能拒绝他
{\fs20}I could never deny him.

969
01:26:49,410 --> 01:26:52,160
为什么要拒绝  我根本不在乎
{\fs20}Why should I? I didn't care.

970
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:54,080
就让他们做任何想做的事好了
{\fs20}Let them do to each other whatever they want to

971
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,710
他们稳坐王位
{\fs20}up on their hill.

972
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:56,840
现在也是吗
{\fs20}Even now.

973
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:00,880
即使发生那种事你也不能拒绝他吗
{\fs20}Even that you could not deny him?

974
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:06,390
我曾爱过他
{\fs20}I did love him... once.

975
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:13,060
他也曾爱过我
{\fs20}And he did love me.

976
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:17,230
你孩子死去的时候
{\fs20}It was he who cried witchcraft

977
01:27:17,230 --> 01:27:18,400
是他造谣你是女巫
{\fs20}when your baby died.

978
01:27:19,690 --> 01:27:22,650
我亲耳听见他承认
{\fs20}I have witnessed his confession.

979
01:27:22,650 --> 01:27:24,420
是他设计了
{\fs20}It was he who set

980
01:27:24,430 --> 01:27:26,200
让暴徒去袭击你
{\fs20}the mob upon you.

981
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:29,400
放任你被烧死
{\fs20}He would have let you burn.

982
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:29,950
不
{\fs20}No.

983
01:27:29,950 --> 01:27:31,410
不  他不会
{\fs20}No, not him.

984
01:27:31,410 --> 01:27:33,080
他迷恋权力
{\fs20}He loves power.

985
01:27:34,290 --> 01:27:36,420
那是他唯一喜爱的东西
{\fs20}That is all he loves.

986
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:39,290
他愚弄了我
{\fs20}He mocked me.

987
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,050
该被烧死的人是他
{\fs20}He shall burn.

988
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:58,190
拿着
{\fs20}Hold these.

989
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:02,010
你的麻烦
{\fs20}You are in more trouble

990
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:03,360
比我想象的还多
{\fs20}than I thought.

991
01:28:22,750 --> 01:28:24,590
站住
{\fs20}Halt right there.

992
01:28:24,590 --> 01:28:25,510
来者何人
{\fs20}Who are you?

993
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:29,470
盟友
{\fs20}A friend.

994
01:29:03,210 --> 01:29:04,710
圣灵啊  发发慈悲吧
{\fs20}Have mercy, spirit.

995
01:29:06,970 --> 01:29:08,550
上帝宽恕我  奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}God forgive me, Ophelia.

996
01:29:12,510 --> 01:29:13,990
你手上沾染的
{\fs20}It is not my blood

997
01:29:13,990 --> 01:29:15,890
不是我的血
{\fs20}you have on your hands.

998
01:29:15,890 --> 01:29:17,800
我不知道克劳狄斯
{\fs20}I did not think Claudius

999
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:19,220
打算杀了他
{\fs20}meant to kill him.

1000
01:29:19,230 --> 01:29:20,850
是你给了他动机
{\fs20}You gave him reason.

1001
01:29:23,650 --> 01:29:25,110
我那时迷失了自己
{\fs20}I'd lost my own.

1002
01:29:26,230 --> 01:29:29,030
他把你的姐姐带向毁灭
{\fs20}He brought your sister to ruin.

1003
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:32,200
克劳狄斯
{\fs20}Claudius?

1004
01:29:34,070 --> 01:29:35,270
你一直不知道
{\fs20}You never knew he was

1005
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:36,290
她爱上的人是他
{\fs20}the man she loved?

1006
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:40,920
我万万没有想到会是他
{\fs20}I thought any man but him.

1007
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:45,170
天哪  我的姐姐
{\fs20}Oh, my sister!

1008
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:55,390
请宽恕我
{\fs20}Absolve me.

1009
01:30:04,230 --> 01:30:05,690
握住我的手
{\fs20}Take my hand.

1010
01:30:11,950 --> 01:30:13,910
你不是鬼魂
{\fs20}You are solid flesh.

1011
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:15,210
但我看见我的儿子
{\fs20}And yet I saw my son

1012
01:30:15,210 --> 01:30:16,570
跃入了你的坟墓
{\fs20}leap into your grave.

1013
01:30:16,580 --> 01:30:17,910
哈姆雷特
{\fs20}Hamlet?

1014
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:19,950
他一听闻你的死讯就下了船
{\fs20}He left the ship when word reached him you had died.

1015
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:21,500
我必须回埃尔西诺
{\fs20}I must return to Elsinore.

1016
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:22,330
不  已经太迟了
{\fs20}No, too late.

1017
01:30:23,830 --> 01:30:25,360
雷欧提斯因为你父亲的死亡
{\fs20}Laertes challenged Hamlet in the

1018
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:26,790
去挑战哈姆雷特
{\fs20}matter of your father's death.

1019
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:29,920
-他们约定好了决斗  -不
{\fs20}- They are set to fight. - No.

1020
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:33,900
我的姐姐在哪里
{\fs20}Where is my sister?

1021
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:35,260
她有主意
{\fs20}She will have counsel.

1022
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:36,890
我不能等下去了
{\fs20}I cannot wait.

1023
01:30:36,890 --> 01:30:38,260
哈姆雷特只会听我的
{\fs20}Hamlet will heed only me.

1024
01:30:38,270 --> 01:30:39,770
克劳狄斯会杀了你的
{\fs20}Claudius will have you killed.

1025
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:43,430
我已经死了
{\fs20}But I'm already dead.

1026
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:23,060
都准备好了吗
{\fs20}Is all prepared?

1027
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:25,060
我在你的剑上抹了毒药
{\fs20}I have anointed your sword.

1028
01:31:25,060 --> 01:31:26,980
轻轻一触就能起效
{\fs20}Just a touch will do.

1029
01:31:28,310 --> 01:31:29,900
哈姆雷特在哪里
{\fs20}Where is Hamlet?

1030
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:31,770
孩子  你叫什么
{\fs20}Boy, what's your name?

1031
01:31:31,770 --> 01:31:32,860
我叫奥斯里克  大人
{\fs20}Osric, Sire.

1032
01:31:32,860 --> 01:31:34,760
去找哈姆雷特  叫他过来
{\fs20}Go fetch Hamlet, bid him come

1033
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:36,070
开始决斗
{\fs20}and start the fight.

1034
01:31:36,070 --> 01:31:37,320
如您所愿  陛下
{\fs20}As you wish, Your Majesty.

1035
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:40,490
你无须恐惧
{\fs20}You have nothing to fear.

1036
01:31:50,590 --> 01:31:52,170
要打赌吗
{\fs20}Shall we wager?

1037
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:55,430
我对打赌没兴趣
{\fs20}I have little appetite for games.

1038
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:00,800
那么我押雷欧提斯赢  勿怪
{\fs20}Then I'll take Laertes, by your leave.

1039
01:32:00,810 --> 01:32:03,520
哈姆雷特的剑术要远胜他
{\fs20}Hamlet is far the better swordsman.

1040
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:08,060
剑术好不代表就能够取胜
{\fs20}The better man does not always win.

1041
01:32:19,110 --> 01:32:22,280
你的内心有两个声音在挣扎
{\fs20}There are two sides struggling in you.

1042
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:26,000
一个卑鄙  一个善良
{\fs20}One is baser, one better.

1043
01:32:33,380 --> 01:32:34,920
奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}Ophelia?

1044
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:36,340
活生生的
{\fs20}In the flesh.

1045
01:32:38,510 --> 01:32:40,930
-你还活着  -我亲爱的
{\fs20}-You live? -My love.

1046
01:32:48,350 --> 01:32:49,050
你就像
{\fs20}You're..

1047
01:32:49,050 --> 01:32:51,400
就像我做的梦一样
{\fs20}You are like a dream I had.

1048
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:53,440
醒来之后就成真了
{\fs20}And when I woke, it was true.

1049
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:00,280
你得明白
{\fs20}You must understand

1050
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:01,910
决斗不是我所求
{\fs20}I seek not this battle.

1051
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:03,870
是雷欧提斯提出来的
{\fs20}Laertes does.

1052
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:06,140
那你自己心中复仇的火焰
{\fs20}And has your own

1053
01:33:06,140 --> 01:33:07,460
熄灭了吗
{\fs20}revenge grown cold?

1054
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:10,380
没有
{\fs20}No.

1055
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:13,950
它依旧灼烧着我
{\fs20}It burns in me still.

1056
01:33:13,950 --> 01:33:15,420
我恐怕是这样
{\fs20}I feared as much.

1057
01:33:16,420 --> 01:33:18,220
哈姆雷特  我们可以现在逃跑
{\fs20}Hamlet, we can escape now.

1058
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:21,430
我们可以逃去修道院
{\fs20}We will flee to the convent.

1059
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:22,790
故事不总是需要
{\fs20}Not every story must

1060
01:33:22,790 --> 01:33:24,010
以决斗来结束
{\fs20}end with a battle.

1061
01:33:24,010 --> 01:33:25,270
哈姆雷特  你在哪儿
{\fs20}Where are you, Hamlet?

1062
01:33:26,180 --> 01:33:27,270
来吧
{\fs20}Come.

1063
01:33:28,020 --> 01:33:29,390
我会的
{\fs20}I will.

1064
01:33:29,390 --> 01:33:31,310
-我会的  -就现在
{\fs20}- I will. - Now.

1065
01:33:32,650 --> 01:33:35,270
我发誓要复仇
{\fs20}I swore vengeance.

1066
01:33:35,270 --> 01:33:38,530
你发誓会爱我  成为我的人
{\fs20}You swore to love me and be mine.

1067
01:33:39,860 --> 01:33:40,950
我属于你
{\fs20}I am yours.

1068
01:33:42,870 --> 01:33:43,870
奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}Ophelia.

1069
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:47,330
我会跟上你的 奥菲莉娅
{\fs20}I will follow you, Ophelia.

1070
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:48,410
哈姆雷特
{\fs20}Hamlet!

1071
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:06,350
再见  我的挚爱
{\fs20}Goodbye, my love.

1072
01:34:11,940 --> 01:34:13,060
-哈姆雷特  -哈姆雷特
{\fs20}-Hamlet! -Hamlet!

1073
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:14,350
-哈姆雷特  -哈姆雷特
{\fs20}-Hamlet! -Hamlet!

1074
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:15,360
-哈姆雷特  -哈姆雷特
{\fs20}-Hamlet! -Hamlet!

1075
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:16,980
-哈姆雷特  -哈姆雷特
{\fs20}-Hamlet! -Hamlet!

1076
01:34:16,980 --> 01:34:17,980
让他过去  殿下
{\fs20}Let him through, My Lord.

1077
01:38:41,250 --> 01:38:43,830
你可能觉得听过我的故事
{\fs20}You may think you know my story.

1078
01:38:45,210 --> 01:38:47,790
它以疯狂为结尾
{\fs20}You've heard it ends in madness

1079
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:49,760
伤透的心
{\fs20}hearts broken..

1080
01:38:51,170 --> 01:38:52,840
鲜血四溅
{\fs20}...blood spilled

1081
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:55,010
王国陨落
{\fs20}a kingdom lost.

1082
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:58,720
那确实是个故事
{\fs20}That is a story.

1083
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:01,640
但不是我的故事
{\fs20}But it is not mine.

1084
01:39:04,190 --> 01:39:06,270
我没有陷入迷茫
{\fs20}I did not lose my way.

1085
01:39:09,570 --> 01:39:11,340
我没有让自己
{\fs20}I did not lose myself

1086
01:39:11,350 --> 01:39:12,450
迷失于复仇
{\fs20}to vengeance.

1087
01:39:14,530 --> 01:39:16,990
取而代之的
{\fs20}Instead I found my way

1088
01:39:16,990 --> 01:39:17,990
我找寻到了希望
{\fs20}to hope..

1089
01:39:20,790 --> 01:39:21,750
终有一日
{\fs20}...that one day

1090
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:23,420
我能讲述我自己的故事
{\fs20}I would tell my own story.

1091
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:31,550
而终有一日  你  我的挚爱
{\fs20}As one day you, my love..

1092
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:36,050
会讲述你自己的故事
{\fs20}...you will tell yours.
