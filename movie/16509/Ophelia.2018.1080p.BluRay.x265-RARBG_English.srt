- Be quiet!
- Laertes, I'm coming with you!

24
00:02:47,048 --> 00:02:48,717
Don't!

25
00:02:51,344 --> 00:02:53,969
- Go back, Ophelia!
- But think of all the books!

26
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:57,934
So, students as well.
Very sweet.

27
00:02:59,477 --> 00:03:01,353
I'll teach you later.

28
00:03:01,355 --> 00:03:04,063
Hush now, make ready
for your studies.

29
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:16,158
- Watch out for dragons!
- Dragons?

30
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,701
It's a shortcut.

31
00:03:17,703 --> 00:03:19,496
Brace of rabbits for skinning.

32
00:03:19,498 --> 00:03:21,580
- Ooh, little rascal!
- Oi!

33
00:03:21,582 --> 00:03:23,042
Ophelia!

34
00:03:30,217 --> 00:03:32,800
- Don't!
- Leave me. I want to see.

35
00:03:45,356 --> 00:03:46,939
To Prince Hamlet!

36
00:03:46,941 --> 00:03:50,235
Leaving us for the great
University of Wittenberg.

37
00:03:50,237 --> 00:03:52,611
Fifteen years old today.

38
00:03:52,613 --> 00:03:56,117
Little more than a boy,
little less than a man.

39
00:03:57,118 --> 00:03:58,743
He insults the prince?

40
00:03:58,745 --> 00:04:00,287
That's his uncle,
the king's brother.

41
00:04:00,289 --> 00:04:02,914
Apple of his mother's eye.

42
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,040
Of course, it was an apple
that tempted a woman

43
00:04:05,042 --> 00:04:06,460
in the Garden of Eden.

44
00:04:06,462 --> 00:04:08,753
I had always thought
it was a snake.

45
00:04:08,755 --> 00:04:11,798
It was an apple of knowledge,
and knowledge kills innocence

46
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,633
as surely as winter snow
kills summer blooms.

47
00:04:13,635 --> 00:04:15,051
Ophelia!

48
00:04:15,053 --> 00:04:17,220
Then I fear for my son
at university

49
00:04:17,222 --> 00:04:19,473
where they will fill him
with knowledge.

50
00:04:21,602 --> 00:04:24,853
- To the prince!
- To the prince!

51
00:04:24,855 --> 00:04:28,859
May he someday rise
from his mother's lap.

52
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:34,487
I think the apple is quite
innocent in the matter.

53
00:04:34,489 --> 00:04:35,908
Ophelia!

54
00:04:37,492 --> 00:04:40,076
What is an Ophelia?

55
00:04:40,078 --> 00:04:41,995
Your Majesty, it is a child

56
00:04:41,997 --> 00:04:44,831
very much like
a snake's tooth and

57
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:49,336
a true snake she is,
in the garden of my duty.

58
00:04:49,338 --> 00:04:51,629
She?

59
00:04:51,631 --> 00:04:54,216
The exact copy and very picture

60
00:04:54,218 --> 00:04:56,843
of her departed
and much lamented mother.

61
00:04:56,845 --> 00:05:00,849
My Ophelia, my daughter,
my treasure.

62
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:12,403
A treasure most in want
of polishing.

63
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,985
This is ladies' work to polish

64
00:05:14,987 --> 00:05:17,615
such a treasure, and alas,
I am no lady.

65
00:05:18,908 --> 00:05:20,783
Alas indeed.

66
00:05:20,785 --> 00:05:24,872
I may be a lass, but there is no
call for such alas-ing.

67
00:05:25,999 --> 00:05:28,126
I would not want to be a lad.

68
00:05:31,547 --> 00:05:34,047
Then she shall be
one of my ladies

69
00:05:34,049 --> 00:05:36,507
and we shall see
to the raising of her.

70
00:05:42,682 --> 00:05:45,727
- Let me go!
- Hold still. Stop moving.

71
00:05:48,855 --> 00:05:52,233
- Hold still.
- Absolutely tragic.

72
00:05:53,276 --> 00:05:54,569
Oh, dear.

73
00:05:55,237 --> 00:05:56,530
Stop!

74
00:06:28,937 --> 00:06:31,273
- She's fair for you.
- Ah, nonsense.

75
00:06:35,985 --> 00:06:37,904
You dance like a goat, Ophelia.

76
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,507
Her father's a flatterer.

77
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:44,677
He wormed his way in
through dirt.

78
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:46,430
Have you seen
how she wears flowers

79
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,848
never jewels in her hair?

80
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,016
I thought she'd been
rolling in the dirt.

81
00:07:51,018 --> 00:07:53,105
She smells of garden soil.

82
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:59,027
Her father can't afford jewels.
She is common.

83
00:08:00,028 --> 00:08:02,071
Whatever does she see in her?

84
00:08:07,785 --> 00:08:08,994
There you are, Ophelia.

85
00:08:08,996 --> 00:08:10,831
What took you
so long this time?

86
00:08:11,581 --> 00:08:13,331
Watch yourself.

87
00:08:16,627 --> 00:08:18,086
- My Lady.
- My Lady.

88
00:08:18,088 --> 00:08:20,215
Quick, before the water cools.

89
00:08:24,052 --> 00:08:27,678
What do I smell?
Like a garden.

90
00:08:31,727 --> 00:08:35,562
Petals for my bath?
Go ahead.

91
00:08:35,564 --> 00:08:37,900
What a lovely idea, girls,
thank you.

92
00:08:39,734 --> 00:08:42,028
You are most welcome, My Lady.

93
00:09:01,631 --> 00:09:03,506
Goodnight.
Take the candles.

94
00:09:03,508 --> 00:09:05,593
My eyes are too weary to read.

95
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:09,428
I could read to you, My Lady.

96
00:09:12,392 --> 00:09:14,934
A girl who knows how to read?

97
00:09:14,936 --> 00:09:16,604
My brother teaches me.

98
00:09:17,606 --> 00:09:19,940
Goodnight, my queen.

99
00:09:19,942 --> 00:09:21,068
Sleep well, My Lady.

100
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:23,612
My Lady.

101
00:09:32,121 --> 00:09:33,956
Shut the door behind you.

102
00:09:43,924 --> 00:09:46,968
Have you seen how the hens in
the yard peck at each other?

103
00:09:48,094 --> 00:09:50,138
Each choosing
the one just weaker.

104
00:09:51,055 --> 00:09:52,891
Why do the ladies peck at you?

105
00:09:54,476 --> 00:09:56,311
I'm not noble, My Lady.

106
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,653
Did you know
I was not raised at court?

107
00:10:06,655 --> 00:10:10,072
My sister and I were sent as
girls to a convent in France.

108
00:10:10,074 --> 00:10:13,744
But even there, there were hens
and they pecked.

109
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,456
Even the nuns?

110
00:10:17,665 --> 00:10:19,834
But I had my sister
to defend me.

111
00:10:23,463 --> 00:10:26,467
Read to me, then.
If you really can.

112
00:10:36,184 --> 00:10:39,019
"A woman of Alencon

113
00:10:39,021 --> 00:10:42,688
"having married for her profit..

114
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:47,195
...found a gentleman
who offered her pleasure."

115
00:10:50,031 --> 00:10:51,699
This is no devotional book.

116
00:10:54,535 --> 00:10:56,829
Something much more important
than prayer.

117
00:10:58,207 --> 00:11:00,373
Read on.

118
00:11:05,421 --> 00:11:09,466
"The gentleman caused her
to find herself

119
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:12,179
"alone with him in an orchard.

120
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,266
"Here he said unto her..

121
00:11:17,892 --> 00:11:21,229
"'Madam, my heart
belongs to you.'

122
00:11:26,443 --> 00:11:29,987
"She protested that he loved
her rank alone.

123
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:35,241
"And he replied,
'Madam, nothing could add

124
00:11:35,243 --> 00:11:38,245
"'to your graces,
except the one thing

125
00:11:38,247 --> 00:11:41,290
"'that can make a face more
beautiful, which is..

126
00:11:42,251 --> 00:11:43,919
"'...transformation..

127
00:11:44,585 --> 00:11:45,962
...in ecstasy.'"

128
00:12:02,186 --> 00:12:06,480
"'My Lord gratifies me
so much, ' replied she.

129
00:12:06,482 --> 00:12:09,775
"I do not ask
for any other thing.

130
00:12:09,777 --> 00:12:12,946
"'Have mercy, good lady, '
cried he

131
00:12:12,948 --> 00:12:15,451
"'for I am gone mad with love.'

132
00:12:18,953 --> 00:12:21,955
"At this, the lady did swoon.

133
00:12:21,957 --> 00:12:25,792
"Then the gentleman,
seeing her half-conquered

134
00:12:25,794 --> 00:12:28,086
"plied her to good purpose

135
00:12:28,088 --> 00:12:31,007
with his
long-concealed passion."

136
00:12:46,189 --> 00:12:48,190
The prince! The prince!
He comes!

137
00:12:50,194 --> 00:12:52,693
- Here he is!
- Look at this, Horatio.

138
00:12:52,695 --> 00:12:53,820
I told you we'd have a welcome.

139
00:12:53,822 --> 00:12:56,782
Oh, and so handsome, so grown.

140
00:12:56,784 --> 00:12:58,658
Every inch a king.

141
00:13:06,376 --> 00:13:08,250
- My dear son!
- Mm!

142
00:13:10,088 --> 00:13:12,715
- It's good to be home.
- Yes.

143
00:13:13,508 --> 00:13:16,092
Come, Horatio.

144
00:13:16,094 --> 00:13:17,637
Don't wanna lose you
at the end of the journey.

145
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:20,599
And now we feast.

146
00:13:37,031 --> 00:13:39,367
I remember this as an
excellent place to fish.

147
00:13:42,703 --> 00:13:44,915
Come away, Hamlet.
Let's, let's try farther down.

148
00:13:49,294 --> 00:13:52,129
A wondrous fish indeed,
inhabits the grove.

149
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,047
The fish would like
to come ashore.

150
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:55,673
Oh, the fish is very welcome.

151
00:13:55,675 --> 00:13:57,216
No fish comes willing
to the fisherman.

152
00:13:57,218 --> 00:13:59,885
My Lord, it's one of the
queen's ladies in waiting.

153
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:03,514
Then she will not mind waiting
till I catch a fish.

154
00:14:03,516 --> 00:14:05,810
Of all of the ladies,
I'm least fond of waiting.

155
00:14:21,702 --> 00:14:24,326
There are two sides
struggling in you.

156
00:14:24,328 --> 00:14:27,080
One is baser, one better.

157
00:14:27,082 --> 00:14:29,249
She tells my fortune, Horatio.

158
00:14:29,251 --> 00:14:31,211
My Lord, it is your misfortune.

159
00:14:33,421 --> 00:14:36,048
- Come away, Hamlet.
- Stay.

160
00:14:44,891 --> 00:14:46,684
'Tis a quick fish, Horatio!

161
00:14:47,644 --> 00:14:49,394
Get me my net!

162
00:14:49,396 --> 00:14:52,107
Such lovely shades
and so lifelike.

163
00:14:53,483 --> 00:14:55,067
And these threads.

164
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:57,279
Oh, for a moment
alone in the forest.

165
00:14:58,155 --> 00:14:59,988
And almost naked.

166
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:02,407
Who do you suppose she'll meet
under that greenwood tree?

167
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:04,951
Well, perhaps she has a
rendezvous with some suitor.

168
00:15:04,953 --> 00:15:06,745
Yes!

169
00:15:06,747 --> 00:15:08,080
Have you ever ventured
into the woods

170
00:15:08,082 --> 00:15:09,288
outside the castle, My Lady?

171
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,624
No, I do not like
the woods myself.

172
00:15:11,626 --> 00:15:14,001
Oh, I would not dare.

173
00:15:14,003 --> 00:15:16,462
Unaccompanied, indeed.

174
00:15:16,464 --> 00:15:18,841
Hamlet, come.

175
00:15:22,096 --> 00:15:24,053
Do you like it?

176
00:15:24,055 --> 00:15:25,514
Most lifelike.

177
00:15:25,516 --> 00:15:28,309
When I am finished,
it will be truer than life.

178
00:15:29,144 --> 00:15:30,604
Oh, where's the hunter?

179
00:15:31,688 --> 00:15:33,649
See, he has left
his arrows there.

180
00:15:35,525 --> 00:15:37,194
Those are her arrows.

181
00:15:39,445 --> 00:15:41,404
Go on, Ophelia.

182
00:15:41,406 --> 00:15:44,323
She is Diana,
goddess of the hunt.

183
00:15:44,325 --> 00:15:46,077
She made her home
in the forest.

184
00:15:47,538 --> 00:15:50,374
She knew no man until the
hunter Actaeon came upon her.

185
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:54,960
A hunter, not a fisherman?

186
00:15:54,962 --> 00:15:58,046
He hid and watched her bathe.

187
00:15:58,048 --> 00:16:00,090
Was he punished
for this trespass?

188
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,427
Mercilessly.

189
00:16:02,969 --> 00:16:06,556
Diana turned him into a stag and
his own hounds tore him apart.

190
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:11,268
And do you ladies think this
punishment was fit?

191
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,063
Hasn't that ever been the story?

192
00:16:14,021 --> 00:16:16,523
Beauty turns men to beasts.

193
00:16:19,569 --> 00:16:21,821
I'd always pictured
the goddess as a girl.

194
00:16:22,823 --> 00:16:25,451
You know, youthful, impulsive.

195
00:16:26,535 --> 00:16:29,201
Diana is too aged
in this weaving.

196
00:16:29,203 --> 00:16:32,623
She is depicted as the queen,
your mother, My Lord.

197
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,590
It's a wretched likeness.

198
00:16:40,882 --> 00:16:42,925
Unpick your threads
and begin again.

199
00:16:49,223 --> 00:16:52,393
- Fetch her tonic.
- Quickly, after the queen.

200
00:17:01,402 --> 00:17:04,571
Where could she be? I hope
she's gone to her chambers.

201
00:17:07,408 --> 00:17:08,700
How did you lose sight of her?

202
00:17:08,702 --> 00:17:10,410
Perhaps she's retired
to her chamber.

203
00:17:10,412 --> 00:17:12,496
- Come quick.
- I mean, really, it's fine.

204
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,708
Well, she doesn't
look aged at all.

205
00:17:29,431 --> 00:17:31,390
Have you lost your way?

206
00:17:38,773 --> 00:17:41,441
I've lived plenty long enough
to know my way

207
00:17:41,443 --> 00:17:43,984
and not yet long enough
to forget it.

208
00:17:49,076 --> 00:17:50,993
Your son has returned..

209
00:17:52,453 --> 00:17:54,289
...you should be all joy.

210
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,792
And, yet, I think you pine.

211
00:18:01,754 --> 00:18:03,755
It is difficult for a mother
when her boy

212
00:18:03,757 --> 00:18:07,511
becomes a man
and no longer hers.

213
00:18:08,928 --> 00:18:11,555
If I were your son,
I would not soon forget you.

214
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,973
And yet you are not my son,
but my brother.

215
00:18:13,975 --> 00:18:16,270
In law, I am your brother.

216
00:18:17,354 --> 00:18:19,648
But I've never much
loved the law.

217
00:18:23,026 --> 00:18:26,113
The gossips say there are many
other things you love.

218
00:18:26,989 --> 00:18:28,824
The gossips are mistaken.

219
00:18:32,661 --> 00:18:33,953
There's only the one thing.

220
00:18:59,021 --> 00:19:00,731
It's very close in here.

221
00:19:01,815 --> 00:19:03,272
Perhaps I need some air.

222
00:19:03,274 --> 00:19:05,483
I often feel as you do
at night.

223
00:19:05,485 --> 00:19:07,693
I take my air on the parapets.

224
00:19:07,695 --> 00:19:09,405
You will find me there.

225
00:19:15,412 --> 00:19:17,998
No. I will not.

226
00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:35,723
How now, Ophelia?

227
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,521
For a flash I thought
you were a ghost.

228
00:19:43,022 --> 00:19:46,107
At school we dissected
a corpse into his parts.

229
00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:48,234
There was no room
for his ghost.

230
00:19:48,236 --> 00:19:50,528
I shall have to take your word
for it, My Lord.

231
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,241
I know nothing of the parts
of men.

232
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:00,665
You stop my heart.

233
00:20:03,251 --> 00:20:05,044
If your heart stopped,
you would die.

234
00:20:06,296 --> 00:20:07,923
I seem to be quite alive.

235
00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:10,925
Appearances deceive.

236
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:15,597
See this.

237
00:20:17,223 --> 00:20:19,098
An innocent flower.

238
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,854
And yet it is belladonna,
the most deadly nightshade.

239
00:20:25,607 --> 00:20:27,358
Belladonna means
beautiful woman.

240
00:20:31,446 --> 00:20:32,780
And you say it is poison.

241
00:20:38,953 --> 00:20:41,165
Will you promise to dance
with me someday?

242
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,792
I'm afraid
I dance like a goat.

243
00:20:59,348 --> 00:21:00,809
You excel today, My Lord.

244
00:21:09,358 --> 00:21:11,984
Nephew. Come.

245
00:21:11,986 --> 00:21:13,111
Try your learning.

246
00:21:13,113 --> 00:21:15,363
I would not want to wound you.

247
00:21:15,365 --> 00:21:19,034
Nor I you.
We'll, uh, we'll fight in fun.

248
00:21:19,036 --> 00:21:20,911
I find no fun in fighting.

249
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:23,371
The winning knight
shall wear my colors.

250
00:21:23,373 --> 00:21:27,834
Rogue. Seems you wear
a lady's colors already.

251
00:21:27,836 --> 00:21:31,296
And you've chosen well if the
girl's as bawdy as her colors.

252
00:21:32,674 --> 00:21:34,340
You watch yourself.

253
00:21:35,636 --> 00:21:39,096
Ah, there's hot blood
in the boy after all.

254
00:21:48,022 --> 00:21:49,565
Well done, Hamlet.

255
00:21:50,192 --> 00:21:51,650
Hamlet!

256
00:21:51,652 --> 00:21:52,817
You debate what to do next.

257
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:55,528
And, meanwhile,
you do next to nothing.

258
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:05,165
Your sword, My Lord.

259
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:08,459
Here...

260
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,055
It seems I was mistaken.

261
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:22,972
You have much to learn.

262
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:25,269
I prefer not to learn
at the point of a sword.

263
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:28,144
My sharpness is within.

264
00:23:13,107 --> 00:23:14,484
Marvelous creature!

265
00:23:25,078 --> 00:23:26,579
A dragonfly!

266
00:23:44,764 --> 00:23:46,349
A dragonfly!

267
00:23:52,271 --> 00:23:54,023
Do not play with me.

268
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:00,948
Oh! Beautiful!

269
00:25:07,556 --> 00:25:09,183
Little fish needs water?

270
00:25:10,434 --> 00:25:11,851
Not water.

271
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,021
Wine?

272
00:25:31,538 --> 00:25:35,166
Some would say that's a pledge,
to drink wine from the same cup.

273
00:25:45,135 --> 00:25:47,259
We mustn't.

274
00:25:54,144 --> 00:25:55,686
I will be missed.

275
00:26:13,704 --> 00:26:16,580
I feel like a lance has gone
in between my ears.

276
00:26:18,085 --> 00:26:19,667
I don't think I've ever felt
like this before, Horatio.

277
00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:20,920
I hope you haven't.

278
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:24,463
Morning, My Lady.

279
00:26:24,465 --> 00:26:28,259
- Did you enjoy the dancing?
- I enjoyed the evening.

280
00:26:28,261 --> 00:26:31,555
It's difficult to enjoy both the
evening and the morning after.

281
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:34,473
Uh, thank God
this summer is over.

282
00:26:34,475 --> 00:26:37,394
My studies hurt my head a little
less than my leisure.

283
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:39,520
You're returning
to your studies?

284
00:26:39,522 --> 00:26:41,649
Uh, we go to Wittenberg today.

285
00:26:45,445 --> 00:26:48,156
- My Lord.
- Leave it all for the pigs.

286
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:53,451
There was a young prince
from the Netherlands

287
00:26:53,453 --> 00:26:55,830
who decided to seek out
the treasury.

288
00:26:56,874 --> 00:26:58,166
Ophelia.

289
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:02,669
- I always meant to say goodbye.
- Goodbye.

290
00:27:02,671 --> 00:27:03,961
Last night, Ophelia. It was...

291
00:27:03,963 --> 00:27:06,006
You'll foul your breeches,
My Lord.

292
00:27:06,008 --> 00:27:08,177
Well, then, goodbye.

293
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:24,609
- Try to understand.
- I am trying.

294
00:27:26,694 --> 00:27:28,405
My father
would never allow it.

295
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,865
He wishes me someday
to take his throne.

296
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:33,616
And I am low.

297
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:36,163
- No, Ophelia.
- I was deceived in you.

298
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,207
I see now
that you are but a prince.

299
00:27:41,835 --> 00:27:43,170
Goodbye.

Do you know
the wood beneath the castle?

313
00:28:49,069 --> 00:28:50,861
I used to play at its edge.

314
00:28:50,863 --> 00:28:53,407
In the wood, lives a woman.

315
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:59,161
Go to her tomorrow
and get me more of what I need.

316
00:28:59,163 --> 00:29:02,329
Make sure you're not followed.
No one must know.

317
00:29:02,331 --> 00:29:05,793
And whatever you do,
do not look upon her face.

318
00:29:06,627 --> 00:29:08,213
Because she is a witch?

319
00:29:15,678 --> 00:29:17,804
She's a healer.

320
00:29:17,806 --> 00:29:19,348
Her name is Mechtild.

321
00:30:42,724 --> 00:30:44,016
Hello?

322
00:31:10,085 --> 00:31:11,587
What do you want?

323
00:31:14,088 --> 00:31:16,131
I was sent by the queen.

324
00:31:16,133 --> 00:31:19,053
- What for?
- For what she needs.

325
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:24,515
And what does she need?

326
00:31:26,726 --> 00:31:31,020
She needs her youth again.

327
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:33,190
Rest from her desires.

328
00:31:33,192 --> 00:31:36,609
A night's sleep
without dreams.

329
00:31:36,611 --> 00:31:38,905
And a husband who mulls love,
not war.

330
00:31:40,616 --> 00:31:42,907
But what she wants..

331
00:31:42,909 --> 00:31:45,369
...is two ounces of my tonic.

332
00:31:46,954 --> 00:31:48,790
Don't touch that!

333
00:31:53,294 --> 00:31:54,921
I can't feel my fingertips.

334
00:31:59,635 --> 00:32:02,136
It's a snake's poison
from the New World.

335
00:32:13,648 --> 00:32:16,650
A touch of it
makes the flesh numb.

336
00:32:16,652 --> 00:32:18,569
Too much of it will kill.

337
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,824
Could I learn such secrets?

338
00:32:24,158 --> 00:32:25,910
You're a lady in waiting.

339
00:32:27,453 --> 00:32:28,996
Learn to wait.

340
00:32:29,665 --> 00:32:30,999
For what?

341
00:32:33,001 --> 00:32:35,170
A husband, little girl,
what else?

342
00:32:46,639 --> 00:32:49,098
And there's no time
for my brother's games.

343
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,933
Norway threatens invasion.

344
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:52,477
Every day is a struggle
for peace.

345
00:32:52,479 --> 00:32:55,480
- It was all in play.
- He plays the fool.

346
00:32:55,482 --> 00:32:57,649
While we're on the brink of war
with our neighbors.

347
00:32:57,651 --> 00:32:59,817
Do not speak ill
of your brother.

348
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:03,779
Claudius shares my name, but the
blood in his veins is impure.

349
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:06,115
We've all heard that story.
There's no cause to believe it.

350
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:07,992
Well, he's his mother's son,
alright, but there is nothing

351
00:33:07,994 --> 00:33:09,118
of my father in him.

352
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,578
Now you insult your mother?

353
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,331
She's no worse
than any other woman.

354
00:33:18,755 --> 00:33:22,423
- Remember yourself, my queen.
- Stay with me, talk to me.

355
00:33:22,425 --> 00:33:26,135
I... I have become
invisible to you.

356
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:27,554
You're more visible
than you realize.

357
00:33:27,556 --> 00:33:30,225
All eyes are on you.
Can you not feel them?

358
00:33:31,851 --> 00:33:33,269
My kingdom needs me.

359
00:35:18,374 --> 00:35:21,334
Give yourself a bit of a fright,
did you?

360
00:35:22,336 --> 00:35:23,629
I saw something.

361
00:35:25,131 --> 00:35:26,756
A specter.

362
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:30,676
Past your bedtime, eh?

363
00:35:30,678 --> 00:35:32,847
And up here's not a place
for a girl.

364
00:35:42,316 --> 00:35:43,942
Tell me, brother..

365
00:35:45,486 --> 00:35:48,071
...how do they know
what is inside a person?

366
00:35:49,573 --> 00:35:53,077
There are men who steal corpses
from the graveyard for study.

367
00:35:57,372 --> 00:36:01,502
What I really wonder is,
where does love reside?

368
00:36:02,502 --> 00:36:05,379
Where truth, or madness?

369
00:36:07,548 --> 00:36:09,425
The only answers
are from science.

370
00:36:11,761 --> 00:36:14,388
I did hear the prince's friend,
Horatio, he..

371
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:17,723
...bribed the gravediggers
to dig up a corpse.

372
00:36:21,647 --> 00:36:24,064
Rosencrantz? Guildenstern!
What's happened?

373
00:36:24,066 --> 00:36:27,109
The king! Long live the king!

374
00:36:35,243 --> 00:36:36,870
Get to your posts!

375
00:36:40,249 --> 00:36:42,749
- Aah!
- The king.

376
00:36:42,751 --> 00:36:45,377
Bitten by a poisonous snake
in his own garden.

377
00:36:45,379 --> 00:36:46,713
He's sick?

378
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,256
He's dead.

379
00:38:18,513 --> 00:38:21,223
Father wrote to Hamlet.
He should be here.

380
00:38:21,225 --> 00:38:24,017
On a day such as this?
He should be far away.

381
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:32,651
Long live King Claudius!

382
00:38:32,653 --> 00:38:37,406
Duly elected,
brave and sober majesty.

383
00:38:37,408 --> 00:38:39,535
- Long live the king.
- Long live the king.

384
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:45,706
Your Majesty.

385
00:38:47,209 --> 00:38:50,502
Your Majesty,
honor us on this day.

386
00:38:50,504 --> 00:38:52,921
- They're lovely, thank you.
- Your Majesty.

387
00:38:52,923 --> 00:38:54,466
Here, take these.

388
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,260
Look at you.

389
00:38:58,345 --> 00:39:00,178
You will be one of my ladies.

390
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,055
Today the queen loves me
above the rest.

391
00:39:02,057 --> 00:39:03,682
But she is fickle..

392
00:39:03,684 --> 00:39:06,225
...and another day you might be
back in favor.

393
00:39:06,227 --> 00:39:09,229
Say not she is fickle.
It is too much said.

394
00:39:09,231 --> 00:39:12,276
A kingdom needs a king
and a king needs a wife.

395
00:39:13,986 --> 00:39:15,444
Why should she be
anything else?

396
00:39:15,446 --> 00:39:17,740
She was already a king's wife.

397
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:22,660
- Oh!
- Is my father buried?

398
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:24,955
Long since, My Lord.

399
00:39:29,542 --> 00:39:32,879
Hamlet!
You were so long returning.

400
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:37,006
So long that the funeral wreaths
are already taken down?

401
00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:40,426
Welcome, Hamlet. We are most
happy you are returned.

402
00:39:40,428 --> 00:39:41,511
Too late, it seems.

403
00:39:41,513 --> 00:39:44,096
Too late to honor
your late father.

404
00:39:44,098 --> 00:39:46,265
It seems my father's honor
is much besmirched.

405
00:39:46,267 --> 00:39:50,481
He grieves, commendably, as
every son who loses a father.

406
00:39:52,149 --> 00:39:55,232
His father lost a father once,
who was my father also.

407
00:39:55,234 --> 00:39:57,861
We were ever men about it.

408
00:39:57,863 --> 00:40:00,113
Man indeed to seduce a woman
to take a crown.

409
00:40:00,115 --> 00:40:02,616
- Hamlet.
- You forget yourself.

410
00:40:02,618 --> 00:40:05,576
The nobles held their election.

411
00:40:05,578 --> 00:40:08,537
I seem to be the only one
present who does not forget.

412
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:10,792
You forget how to greet a king!

413
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:27,016
I am your king.

414
00:41:15,566 --> 00:41:17,109
Come, Gertrude.

415
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:19,611
Let us eat.

416
00:41:52,019 --> 00:41:53,687
- Hey!
- Give it back.

417
00:42:02,988 --> 00:42:04,904
Stop it.

418
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,827
Look, we've caught ourselves
a pheasant.

419
00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:12,122
Get off her!

420
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:15,209
Or what?

421
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,216
Come on.

422
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,136
Let me loose.
You will pay for this.

423
00:42:28,138 --> 00:42:31,098
What? You want me to pay for it.
She wants me to pay for it!

424
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,058
Let the maiden go.
This one really is a whore!

425
00:42:36,939 --> 00:42:39,564
The air smells very ripe.

426
00:42:39,566 --> 00:42:42,274
Perhaps a bath is in order.

427
00:42:42,276 --> 00:42:44,444
What'd you say to me? Huh?

428
00:42:44,446 --> 00:42:47,363
- Let her be!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

429
00:42:47,365 --> 00:42:48,490
Come away.

430
00:42:48,492 --> 00:42:50,577
Mastered by a maiden I see!

431
00:42:53,247 --> 00:42:56,125
Come away. Hamlet, no.
Come away.

432
00:43:02,171 --> 00:43:04,756
Thank you, Your Highness.
But I had no need of saving.

433
00:43:04,758 --> 00:43:08,093
You speak of need.
In need I sought you.

434
00:43:08,095 --> 00:43:09,636
I have missed you, Ophelia.

435
00:43:09,638 --> 00:43:11,513
I should apologize for my
behavior to you last summer.

436
00:43:11,515 --> 00:43:13,305
- You should?
- I do.

437
00:43:13,307 --> 00:43:15,558
- It is forgotten.
- Forgotten but not forgiven.

438
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,977
Both.

439
00:43:16,979 --> 00:43:18,437
I have never forgotten you.

440
00:43:18,439 --> 00:43:20,149
You'll forgive me
if I doubt it.

441
00:43:24,528 --> 00:43:26,071
Where is the water, Ophelia?

442
00:43:27,321 --> 00:43:28,781
- Cover the queen.
- Hamlet.

443
00:43:29,783 --> 00:43:31,535
What is the matter?

444
00:43:33,703 --> 00:43:35,580
What forgetting is here?

445
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:38,584
Hamlet?

446
00:43:44,756 --> 00:43:46,758
It is only a filthy
bit of ribbon.

447
00:43:48,426 --> 00:43:50,095
My tonic, please.

448
00:43:57,602 --> 00:43:58,602
Again.

449
00:44:03,399 --> 00:44:04,816
Farewell, sister.

450
00:44:04,818 --> 00:44:06,526
I'm to continue my education
in France.

451
00:44:06,528 --> 00:44:07,611
You are leaving?

452
00:44:07,613 --> 00:44:09,529
These are strange times
in this castle.

453
00:44:09,531 --> 00:44:10,866
Strange indeed.

454
00:44:12,533 --> 00:44:15,201
Rumors abound
of all shapes and sizes.

455
00:44:15,203 --> 00:44:17,037
All of them frighten me.

456
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:20,122
They are saying the prince no
longer sees you as a child.

457
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:21,751
I am no longer a child.

458
00:44:22,336 --> 00:44:23,377
Ophelia..

459
00:44:24,754 --> 00:44:26,462
...be afraid.

460
00:44:26,464 --> 00:44:28,089
Afraid of all
he can take from you.

461
00:44:28,091 --> 00:44:30,716
You will only be safe
if you are afraid.

462
00:44:30,718 --> 00:44:33,388
Tend to your own honor
and I will tend to mine.

463
00:44:34,932 --> 00:44:36,723
Laertes, hurry!

464
00:44:36,725 --> 00:44:39,603
Time and tide
wait for no man.

465
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:47,234
Now..

466
00:44:47,236 --> 00:44:49,903
...my blessing on you, son.

467
00:44:49,905 --> 00:44:52,781
Now, remember,
keep your own counsel.

468
00:44:52,783 --> 00:44:55,950
Don't be familiar or vulgar.

469
00:44:55,952 --> 00:44:58,370
And don't fight,
or if you do, win.

470
00:44:58,372 --> 00:45:01,415
Um, dress well.
But don't spend too much.

471
00:45:01,417 --> 00:45:03,917
Don't borrow any money
or lend it.

472
00:45:03,919 --> 00:45:07,256
And above all,
be true to yourself.

473
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:10,633
Farewell, father.

474
00:45:12,093 --> 00:45:13,843
And take care, Ophelia.

475
00:45:13,845 --> 00:45:15,430
Remember what I said.

476
00:45:20,227 --> 00:45:24,479
- What did he say?
- Something about Lord Hamlet.

477
00:45:24,481 --> 00:45:26,524
Ah, yes, Hamlet.

478
00:45:27,943 --> 00:45:30,986
They say he ran
into the queen's chamber

479
00:45:30,988 --> 00:45:34,613
and stared at you
and spoke very strangely.

480
00:45:34,615 --> 00:45:36,075
I saw it, yes.

481
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:42,663
Did he bestow on you
some... sign of love?

482
00:45:42,665 --> 00:45:44,332
No.

483
00:45:44,334 --> 00:45:45,794
Are you lying to me, daughter?

484
00:45:46,836 --> 00:45:48,544
Yes.

485
00:45:48,546 --> 00:45:51,800
A lying yes
is equal to a no.

486
00:45:52,843 --> 00:45:53,801
No.

487
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:56,637
So, yes?

488
00:45:58,848 --> 00:46:02,058
This could prove
very advantageous for us.

489
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:04,021
I want nothing
to do with him, father.

490
00:46:06,106 --> 00:46:08,941
You're a very bad girl
to be so good.

491
00:46:17,033 --> 00:46:19,118
Ophelia. Come in.

492
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,580
Girls are not allowed
in the library..

493
00:46:23,582 --> 00:46:25,040
...unless they're in the books.

494
00:46:25,042 --> 00:46:28,295
Yet I think you have been
in here before. Come in.

495
00:46:44,185 --> 00:46:45,977
I wish someday to be a healer.

496
00:46:45,979 --> 00:46:47,854
There are many different kinds
of healer.

497
00:46:47,856 --> 00:46:50,857
A doctor then,
a man of science.

498
00:46:50,859 --> 00:46:53,529
You know graves are robbed
for such science?

499
00:46:54,821 --> 00:46:56,404
Look, Hamlet is much distressed.

500
00:46:56,406 --> 00:46:58,531
He behaves wildly towards me.

501
00:46:58,533 --> 00:47:01,493
But there is a method
in his madness. Trust me.

502
00:47:01,495 --> 00:47:03,205
Go to him, please.

503
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:07,374
Where?

504
00:47:07,376 --> 00:47:09,084
The ramparts..

505
00:47:09,086 --> 00:47:10,294
...at midnight.

506
00:47:16,008 --> 00:47:18,634
Stay away from my grave
when I am dead.

507
00:47:18,636 --> 00:47:21,930
Ophelia, do not be so morbid.

508
00:47:21,932 --> 00:47:24,727
I have no interest in becoming
some man's anatomy lesson.

509
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,245
- You tremble, Ophelia.
- You frightened me, My Lord.

510
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:48,624
They are saying in the court
there is a ghost up here.

511
00:47:49,709 --> 00:47:51,127
I thought I saw it once myself.

512
00:47:52,838 --> 00:47:55,296
They say it is
my father's unquiet spirit.

513
00:47:56,466 --> 00:47:58,760
Careful, the sentinel comes.

514
00:48:17,988 --> 00:48:19,321
They say of all
the queen's ladies

515
00:48:19,323 --> 00:48:21,781
you are the one
who knows her secrets.

516
00:48:21,783 --> 00:48:24,618
To say you know a secret
is to tell the secret.

517
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:27,662
Tell me only this, Ophelia.

518
00:48:27,664 --> 00:48:31,126
Was my mother true to my father,
her husband, the king?

519
00:48:31,794 --> 00:48:33,295
I cannot tell you.

520
00:48:38,841 --> 00:48:40,218
And yet you cannot lie.

521
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,059
Fickle.

522
00:48:49,102 --> 00:48:52,145
My mother is like all women.
Fickle, frail.

523
00:48:52,147 --> 00:48:53,357
My Lord..

524
00:48:54,149 --> 00:48:56,357
...you are most unjust.

525
00:48:56,359 --> 00:48:59,444
Frailty in love
is not a habit of my sex.

526
00:48:59,446 --> 00:49:01,073
Perhaps it runs in families.

527
00:49:02,825 --> 00:49:04,076
Forgive me.

528
00:49:05,743 --> 00:49:07,495
I see now what people are..

529
00:49:09,164 --> 00:49:10,665
...and only you are not.

530
00:49:12,459 --> 00:49:13,877
Not you, Ophelia.

531
00:49:15,838 --> 00:49:17,504
Be comforted, My Lord.

532
00:49:17,506 --> 00:49:21,508
♪ The stars are fire.. ♪

533
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:22,720
Ophelia..

534
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,470
...my true love.

535
00:49:25,472 --> 00:49:30,642
♪ Doubt truth to be a liar ♪

536
00:49:30,644 --> 00:49:36,230
♪ But never doubt I love ♪♪

537
00:50:28,702 --> 00:50:29,745
The queen.

538
00:50:34,415 --> 00:50:36,625
She wants her tonic.

539
00:50:36,627 --> 00:50:41,673
Oh, she wants, she wants,
she gets what she wants.

540
00:50:43,091 --> 00:50:46,595
- She fears to feel.
- And you?

541
00:50:47,638 --> 00:50:49,306
What do you think you know?

542
00:50:51,432 --> 00:50:54,600
You pretend you have
a broken heart.

543
00:50:54,602 --> 00:50:58,354
That you are innocent
and wounded.

544
00:50:58,356 --> 00:51:03,109
But you cannot hide your true
self under ladies' clothes.

545
00:51:03,111 --> 00:51:05,654
You are wild and full of desire.

546
00:51:05,656 --> 00:51:08,198
They will strip you,
they will judge you

547
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,120
and they will find you
wanting death.

548
00:51:14,455 --> 00:51:17,166
They will cast you to the fire.

549
00:51:21,629 --> 00:51:24,425
Do you know why they call me
a witch?

550
00:51:29,263 --> 00:51:31,805
At 19, I was with child

551
00:51:31,807 --> 00:51:35,475
by a man who swore
he'd marry me.

552
00:51:35,477 --> 00:51:38,019
When my baby died inside me

553
00:51:38,021 --> 00:51:42,189
rumors spread
it was the devil's work.

554
00:51:42,191 --> 00:51:45,776
The righteous came
to cast the devil out.

555
00:51:47,363 --> 00:51:48,779
Burn her!

556
00:51:48,781 --> 00:51:50,866
But they didn't know..

557
00:51:50,868 --> 00:51:53,203
...I knew my poisons.

558
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:58,874
Three drops on the tongue, the
venom mimics death but mocks it.

559
00:51:58,876 --> 00:52:00,375
Burn the witch!

560
00:52:00,377 --> 00:52:01,879
They thought me dead.

561
00:52:03,504 --> 00:52:06,090
You drank the venom
but didn't die?

562
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,013
They found my corpse,
threw me away

563
00:52:14,015 --> 00:52:16,476
and declared
the devil vanquished.

564
00:52:19,021 --> 00:52:23,484
I had my remedy laid by
and so I lived.

565
00:52:24,943 --> 00:52:26,361
But without my son.

566
00:52:29,865 --> 00:52:31,700
And what of his father?

567
00:52:37,122 --> 00:52:39,332
He was quite recently married.

568
00:53:07,236 --> 00:53:08,487
Ophelia.

569
00:53:12,698 --> 00:53:13,825
Ophelia.

570
00:53:26,879 --> 00:53:29,798
Confess to me,
the keeper of your soul.

571
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,385
Do you love another?

572
00:53:33,803 --> 00:53:35,263
I love only you.

573
00:53:38,267 --> 00:53:41,102
Then meet me tomorrow
at the old chapel by the lake.

574
00:53:42,229 --> 00:53:44,020
Disguise yourself
as a country lass.

575
00:53:44,022 --> 00:53:45,312
And you a shepherd?

576
00:53:48,736 --> 00:53:51,153
There will be talk.
I fear there is already.

577
00:53:51,155 --> 00:53:52,488
Let them talk.

578
00:53:54,115 --> 00:53:55,283
Ophelia..

579
00:53:58,953 --> 00:54:00,622
...I want to marry you.

580
00:54:05,002 --> 00:54:08,002
- They will never allow it!
- Ophelia, they will not know.

581
00:54:08,004 --> 00:54:10,337
But all of Denmark
should be yours.

582
00:54:10,339 --> 00:54:12,256
If you were beside me
I would take grass

583
00:54:12,258 --> 00:54:14,469
over Denmark's gilded throne.

584
00:54:16,013 --> 00:54:19,098
When the time comes
we will go away from here.

585
00:54:27,316 --> 00:54:30,649
"My beloved spake,
and said unto me

586
00:54:30,651 --> 00:54:35,821
"rise up, my love,
my fair one, and come away.

587
00:54:35,823 --> 00:54:38,825
"Let him kiss me with the kisses
of his mouth..

588
00:54:38,827 --> 00:54:41,620
"...for his love
is better than wine.

589
00:54:41,622 --> 00:54:45,122
"My beloved is mine
and I am his.

590
00:54:45,124 --> 00:54:46,332
"Behold..

591
00:54:46,334 --> 00:54:48,292
"...thou art fair, my love

592
00:54:48,294 --> 00:54:50,630
"thou hast doves' eyes.

593
00:54:51,881 --> 00:54:53,339
"Behold..

594
00:54:53,341 --> 00:54:55,510
"...thou art fair, my beloved..

595
00:54:56,761 --> 00:55:00,346
"...and also our bed is green.

596
00:55:00,348 --> 00:55:05,435
"For, lo, the winter is past,
and the rain is over and gone.

597
00:55:05,437 --> 00:55:07,564
"Flowers appear on the earth.

598
00:55:08,524 --> 00:55:11,316
"Set me as a seal on your heart

599
00:55:11,318 --> 00:55:14,363
for love is stronger
than death."

600
00:56:52,752 --> 00:56:54,379
Good morning, My Lady.

601
00:56:57,508 --> 00:56:59,299
You're up early.

602
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:07,309
Or were you up all night?

603
00:57:11,814 --> 00:57:16,691
I'm told you spend your days in
the country with a common boy..

604
00:57:16,693 --> 00:57:18,821
...dressed
like a farmer's daughter.

605
00:57:20,321 --> 00:57:21,698
You don't deny it?

606
00:57:25,243 --> 00:57:29,995
You repay my kindness
by disgracing yourself?

607
00:57:29,997 --> 00:57:32,751
No need to make yourself
lower than you already are.

608
00:57:37,004 --> 00:57:38,587
There you are.

609
00:57:38,589 --> 00:57:39,883
Good morning.

610
00:57:45,513 --> 00:57:48,850
- Do you have what I need?
- I do.

611
00:58:02,865 --> 00:58:04,321
Why do you stare?

612
00:58:04,323 --> 00:58:06,534
You look like you've seen
a ghost.

613
00:58:09,162 --> 00:58:10,828
Leave us, Ophelia.

614
00:58:25,678 --> 00:58:27,222
What keeps you?

615
00:58:29,223 --> 00:58:31,600
Your cloak is torn,
Your Majesty.

616
00:58:31,602 --> 00:58:33,562
Perhaps I could mend it for you?

617
00:58:40,903 --> 00:58:42,404
Are you fast?

618
00:58:44,406 --> 00:58:46,113
You mean my stitches,
Your Majesty?

619
00:58:46,115 --> 00:58:48,910
I think you know what I mean,
Ophelia.

620
00:58:51,245 --> 00:58:56,082
My nephew has been
very strange of late.

621
00:58:56,084 --> 00:58:58,627
He haunts the corridors
at night.

622
00:58:58,629 --> 00:59:00,214
Do you know the cause of that?

623
00:59:02,381 --> 00:59:04,092
Maybe you know the cure.

624
00:59:06,303 --> 00:59:10,015
Perhaps you are the cause
and the cure.

625
00:59:13,102 --> 00:59:17,937
Your father says that my nephew
is in love with you. Is it so?

626
00:59:17,939 --> 00:59:21,107
Hm, my father told me
it could not be so.

627
00:59:21,109 --> 00:59:25,780
- Has he said he loves you?
- Never, Your Majesty.

628
00:59:26,865 --> 00:59:29,281
Has he given you a token
of his love?

629
00:59:29,283 --> 00:59:30,368
Never.

630
00:59:38,627 --> 00:59:40,459
It was all done in innocence,
Your Majesty.

631
00:59:40,461 --> 00:59:42,629
If I know what I know,
they're just children at play!

632
00:59:42,631 --> 00:59:44,964
You said something
quite different before.

633
00:59:44,966 --> 00:59:48,176
I have re-thought myself,
and other things.

634
00:59:49,638 --> 00:59:52,808
I have been worried
about Hamlet's state of mind.

635
00:59:57,812 --> 00:59:59,897
Here is the bait for him.

636
01:00:01,024 --> 01:00:02,443
Now, we shall see.

637
01:00:44,151 --> 01:00:45,069
Nymph!

638
01:00:46,194 --> 01:00:48,111
Where is your water?

639
01:00:48,113 --> 01:00:50,071
My Lord, there is much
I need to tell you.

640
01:00:50,073 --> 01:00:52,031
Wh... what way is that to
greet your husband?

641
01:00:52,033 --> 01:00:54,743
- None.
- Are you not my wife?

642
01:00:54,745 --> 01:00:57,372
These games you play, My Lord,
nothing is ever as it seems.

643
01:01:00,542 --> 01:01:02,795
I have a remembrance
I wish to return to you.

644
01:01:03,961 --> 01:01:06,004
I gave you nothing. I took.

645
01:01:06,006 --> 01:01:08,381
Your father was poisoned.
It is true.

646
01:01:08,383 --> 01:01:11,343
I once saw your uncle at a place
where poisons are made.

647
01:01:11,345 --> 01:01:12,843
I did not recognize him then

648
01:01:12,845 --> 01:01:15,055
but I saw him again
on the ramparts, disguised

649
01:01:15,057 --> 01:01:19,058
the very day your father,
the king, was stung.

650
01:01:21,522 --> 01:01:22,439
So it..

651
01:01:24,066 --> 01:01:26,399
...so it was no snake

652
01:01:26,401 --> 01:01:27,401
but Claudius.

653
01:01:27,403 --> 01:01:28,984
I must repulse your attentions

654
01:01:28,986 --> 01:01:30,988
My Lord,
they have been forbidden.

655
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:35,741
Are you sure what you say
is true?

656
01:01:35,743 --> 01:01:38,704
I found the poison in his cloak
this very morning.

657
01:01:42,084 --> 01:01:44,500
Then he has stolen
my crown from me.

658
01:01:44,502 --> 01:01:47,837
Y... y... you said you did not
want the crown.

659
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:50,050
You forswore it when you
married me.

660
01:01:51,426 --> 01:01:53,553
I did not know
it had been stolen.

661
01:01:59,435 --> 01:02:01,183
Cry out as if I frighten you.

662
01:02:01,185 --> 01:02:04,687
- God help him, merciful Lord!
- They say I am mad!

663
01:02:04,689 --> 01:02:06,564
Mad with love, they say, of me.

664
01:02:06,566 --> 01:02:09,109
Then I will be mad!

665
01:02:09,111 --> 01:02:10,609
And they will not see me coming.

666
01:02:10,611 --> 01:02:11,694
I don't understand your meaning.

667
01:02:11,696 --> 01:02:13,448
You should not know what I mean.

668
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:16,827
Remain innocent as snow.

669
01:02:19,203 --> 01:02:20,372
Cry out.

670
01:02:22,499 --> 01:02:23,625
Cry out.

671
01:02:25,169 --> 01:02:26,377
God help you, sir.

672
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:32,758
The danger for you
is very great.

673
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:35,301
We must get you away from here.

674
01:02:35,303 --> 01:02:36,928
There is a convent in
St. Emilion

675
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:39,263
where my mother lived as a girl.

676
01:02:39,265 --> 01:02:40,598
You will be safe among the nuns.

677
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:43,061
- Hamlet, you cannot do this!
- Go to the nunnery!

678
01:02:47,607 --> 01:02:48,859
Go!

679
01:02:56,115 --> 01:02:57,700
He seems..

680
01:02:58,910 --> 01:02:59,952
...mad.

681
01:03:02,539 --> 01:03:04,999
I think your daughter
is dangerous.

682
01:03:07,752 --> 01:03:10,127
She should be married

683
01:03:10,129 --> 01:03:12,090
as soon as possible.

684
01:03:14,676 --> 01:03:16,595
I know a guard
who will do my will.

685
01:03:25,854 --> 01:03:27,520
Greetings, Lord Hamlet.

686
01:03:29,607 --> 01:03:31,357
Who are you greeting, my love?

687
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:33,192
Lord Hamlet!

688
01:03:33,194 --> 01:03:35,069
- Please, come in!
- Hey!

689
01:03:35,071 --> 01:03:36,154
Everyone, come in.

690
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:47,707
This will settle it, Horatio.

691
01:03:47,709 --> 01:03:49,334
Adultery, murder, treachery!

692
01:03:49,336 --> 01:03:52,587
- These are his crimes!
- No! My Lord, you can't go.

693
01:03:52,589 --> 01:03:54,049
She should not be here!

694
01:03:55,551 --> 01:03:56,510
There he is!

695
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:00,053
He's come to sell me a fish!

696
01:04:00,055 --> 01:04:02,263
I am no fish-seller, My Lord.

697
01:04:02,265 --> 01:04:04,225
But what a lovely fish it is.

698
01:04:05,227 --> 01:04:07,894
Hamlet! Come sit by me.

699
01:04:07,896 --> 01:04:09,562
What if there was someone
prettier, mother

700
01:04:09,564 --> 01:04:11,232
who I would rather sit on?

701
01:04:13,109 --> 01:04:15,819
Do not lie there, My Lord.
Get up.

702
01:04:15,821 --> 01:04:17,611
Well, where can I lie?

703
01:04:17,613 --> 01:04:18,821
Can I lie in your lap?

704
01:04:18,823 --> 01:04:20,741
- No, My Lord.
- I mean my head in your lap.

705
01:04:20,743 --> 01:04:22,533
You are merry, My Lord.

706
01:04:22,535 --> 01:04:24,745
Married? Indeed!

707
01:04:24,747 --> 01:04:26,787
You should know!

708
01:04:26,789 --> 01:04:29,915
My mother was married, and she
was widowed only hours ago.

709
01:04:29,917 --> 01:04:32,711
Hold your tongue
and master this madness.

710
01:04:32,713 --> 01:04:34,589
They want me to marry another.

711
01:04:36,841 --> 01:04:39,093
If you must marry, marry a fool.

712
01:04:42,430 --> 01:04:44,055
I knew a fool once.

713
01:04:44,057 --> 01:04:45,348
His name was Yorick.

714
01:04:45,350 --> 01:04:47,558
He made a fool
of the king's brother.

715
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:49,060
I saw him once.

716
01:04:49,062 --> 01:04:50,270
He made the king laugh.

717
01:04:50,272 --> 01:04:53,439
And paid with his life
that very same night.

718
01:04:53,441 --> 01:04:55,526
'Tis a very sad story indeed.

719
01:04:57,571 --> 01:04:59,490
I know a sadder one, Ophelia.

720
01:05:03,077 --> 01:05:04,825
It starts now.

721
01:05:41,448 --> 01:05:43,656
I told you
to get to the nunnery.

722
01:06:58,941 --> 01:06:59,901
A light.

723
01:07:01,778 --> 01:07:02,737
A light.

724
01:07:05,573 --> 01:07:07,823
- Let there be light!
- It is a mere spectacle!

725
01:07:07,825 --> 01:07:10,076
You end this now,
or I will end it myself!

726
01:07:10,078 --> 01:07:11,787
You are making us the spectacle!

727
01:07:12,997 --> 01:07:15,876
You take them all out
and have them hanged!

728
01:07:16,752 --> 01:07:20,754
I am your king!

729
01:07:20,756 --> 01:07:22,591
The king knows the play is true.

730
01:07:23,425 --> 01:07:25,091
Vengeance is mine.

731
01:07:25,093 --> 01:07:27,093
Swift, now.

732
01:07:27,095 --> 01:07:29,013
Hamlet! No.

733
01:07:40,441 --> 01:07:41,776
'Tis treason..

734
01:07:45,113 --> 01:07:46,865
...to draw on the king.

735
01:07:59,294 --> 01:08:02,129
Call the guards!

736
01:08:02,131 --> 01:08:04,131
Take them to the gallows!

737
01:08:12,265 --> 01:08:14,515
I thought your lover
was too low.

738
01:08:14,517 --> 01:08:16,767
But I see he's too high.

739
01:08:16,769 --> 01:08:20,104
You are first among those
who might understand.

740
01:08:20,106 --> 01:08:22,189
I was a mother to you

741
01:08:22,191 --> 01:08:24,859
and you turned my son
against me.

742
01:08:24,861 --> 01:08:26,318
Forgive me.

743
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:28,947
My Lady, you raised me.

744
01:08:29,992 --> 01:08:31,952
I think you protest too much.

745
01:08:33,328 --> 01:08:36,039
You cannot know what it is
to love a son.

746
01:08:37,458 --> 01:08:40,502
I know what it is to love yours.

747
01:08:45,047 --> 01:08:47,133
You stay away from him.

748
01:08:48,135 --> 01:08:50,053
And stay out of my sight!

749
01:08:54,098 --> 01:08:55,139
We are ruined!

750
01:08:56,517 --> 01:08:58,309
The queen has dismissed you

751
01:08:58,311 --> 01:09:00,853
and I will probably follow.

752
01:09:00,855 --> 01:09:02,438
If we can still get you married

753
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:03,523
you'll be less of a threat.

754
01:09:03,525 --> 01:09:05,776
- What?
- Tomorrow and not soon enough.

755
01:09:05,778 --> 01:09:08,277
Please, no. I cannot bear it.

756
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:11,740
Our new king is baying
for blood.

757
01:09:11,742 --> 01:09:14,658
I am just trying to survive.

758
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:16,036
Survival isn't enough.

759
01:09:18,915 --> 01:09:21,166
You are so like your mother.

760
01:09:21,168 --> 01:09:22,959
No arrangement there.

761
01:09:22,961 --> 01:09:24,296
You loved her.

762
01:09:25,797 --> 01:09:27,964
I will speak to the queen.

763
01:09:27,966 --> 01:09:30,386
And I will beg her forgiveness.

764
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:00,248
Father?

765
01:10:03,418 --> 01:10:05,544
Horatio, you look fraught.

766
01:10:05,546 --> 01:10:06,922
What are you doing here?

767
01:10:07,922 --> 01:10:09,423
Is it Hamlet?

768
01:10:09,425 --> 01:10:11,008
No, Hamlet lives.

769
01:10:13,721 --> 01:10:15,679
Your father was killed.

770
01:10:15,681 --> 01:10:18,932
- Not mine. Hamlet's?
- No, yours.

771
01:10:18,934 --> 01:10:19,851
My Lord Polonius.

772
01:10:22,604 --> 01:10:23,687
Forgive me!

773
01:10:23,689 --> 01:10:25,772
Forgive me, Ophelia!

774
01:10:25,774 --> 01:10:27,773
Hamlet is mad indeed!

775
01:10:27,775 --> 01:10:29,693
He thought it was his uncle.

776
01:10:29,695 --> 01:10:32,489
He drew his sword
before I could say..

777
01:10:34,074 --> 01:10:36,450
...who was hidden.

778
01:10:36,452 --> 01:10:39,704
It was an accident.
Not Hamlet's fault, but mine.

779
01:11:17,618 --> 01:11:19,328
Where is Hamlet?

780
01:11:21,245 --> 01:11:22,330
Gone.

781
01:11:23,873 --> 01:11:24,957
Gone?

782
01:11:26,668 --> 01:11:28,667
To England.

783
01:11:28,669 --> 01:11:30,297
With Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern.

784
01:11:31,798 --> 01:11:32,925
King's orders.

785
01:11:34,051 --> 01:11:35,260
For his own safety.

786
01:11:37,387 --> 01:11:40,015
It's good of the king
to think of his safety.

787
01:11:42,392 --> 01:11:44,352
To hurt you, Ophelia.

788
01:11:45,561 --> 01:11:47,355
You cannot imagine his anguish.

789
01:11:52,694 --> 01:11:56,321
- Where is my father?
- Man the gates!

790
01:11:56,323 --> 01:11:57,822
Where is he?

791
01:11:57,824 --> 01:11:59,782
Who murdered my father?

792
01:11:59,784 --> 01:12:01,701
I will have justice.

793
01:12:01,703 --> 01:12:03,370
An eye for an eye.

794
01:12:03,372 --> 01:12:05,913
An eye for an eye!
Who murdered my father?

795
01:12:05,915 --> 01:12:08,041
Be calm.

796
01:12:08,043 --> 01:12:10,501
It is right and good to
want to avenge his killing.

797
01:12:10,503 --> 01:12:13,880
- But he did not die by my hand.
- Then whose?

798
01:12:13,882 --> 01:12:14,842
Hamlet.

799
01:12:16,385 --> 01:12:18,218
Then Hamlet will die at my hand.

800
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:19,512
No, Laertes.

801
01:12:20,638 --> 01:12:23,389
It was all a mistake.

802
01:12:23,391 --> 01:12:25,476
You must think of your
sister now.

803
01:12:28,521 --> 01:12:31,063
- Take me to her.
- I will send for her.

804
01:12:31,065 --> 01:12:32,566
- Open the gate!
- Come.

805
01:12:32,568 --> 01:12:34,278
There is much to tell you.

806
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:40,282
Good thing you are
getting married today.

807
01:12:40,284 --> 01:12:42,578
You're already fat as a cow.

808
01:12:45,329 --> 01:12:47,538
You're lucky to find a husband
at all with no fortune

809
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:50,127
no family and no virtue left.

810
01:12:55,007 --> 01:12:56,798
I hope you're not still
keeping a candle lit

811
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,761
for your lover, the prince.

812
01:12:59,762 --> 01:13:01,555
One candle would not be enough.

813
01:13:02,722 --> 01:13:05,348
Even if he ceased to be at all?

814
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:07,436
If he dies then I die as well.

815
01:13:10,230 --> 01:13:11,815
You seem alive to me.

816
01:13:13,775 --> 01:13:14,776
Alive

817
01:13:15,444 --> 01:13:16,403
but married.

818
01:13:17,695 --> 01:13:18,696
To Hamlet?

819
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:25,537
Then you are a widow.

820
01:13:28,707 --> 01:13:30,626
Hamlet is dead already.

821
01:13:32,293 --> 01:13:35,295
My Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
were sent with him.

822
01:13:35,297 --> 01:13:38,384
They did not like their orders,
but they obeyed the king.

823
01:13:40,886 --> 01:13:42,928
What did the king
tell them to do?

824
01:13:42,930 --> 01:13:44,554
I will not tell!

825
01:13:45,556 --> 01:13:47,057
Tell me.

826
01:13:48,476 --> 01:13:51,603
- Oh! Ah!
- Get her away! She's mad.

827
01:13:51,605 --> 01:13:53,063
Ah! Ah!

828
01:13:55,650 --> 01:13:57,653
Tell me or I swear..

829
01:14:00,364 --> 01:14:01,446
The minute the ship left port

830
01:14:01,448 --> 01:14:03,407
they were to throw him
overboard.

831
01:14:06,412 --> 01:14:07,995
And they sailed last night.

832
01:14:46,702 --> 01:14:52,913
♪ Doubt truth to be a liar ♪

833
01:14:52,915 --> 01:14:59,047
♪ But never doubt I love ♪♪

834
01:15:04,011 --> 01:15:05,053
Ophelia.

835
01:15:06,137 --> 01:15:08,056
Hamlet is dead, Horatio.

836
01:15:08,891 --> 01:15:10,182
Dead?

837
01:15:10,184 --> 01:15:12,768
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
had orders to betray him

838
01:15:12,770 --> 01:15:14,310
when the ship sailed.

839
01:15:14,312 --> 01:15:15,853
The harbor is becalmed.

840
01:15:15,855 --> 01:15:17,273
The ship still rests there.

841
01:15:18,191 --> 01:15:19,234
It has not left.

842
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:28,492
Then he lives?
Horatio, we can still save him.

843
01:15:28,494 --> 01:15:29,411
- I...
- Horatio.

844
01:15:31,579 --> 01:15:33,580
The king requires you.

845
01:15:33,582 --> 01:15:34,956
Have you seen my bride, Ophelia?

846
01:15:34,958 --> 01:15:36,207
No. Not of late.

847
01:15:36,209 --> 01:15:37,291
The whole castle
searches for her.

848
01:15:37,293 --> 01:15:38,751
The king bay them
lock the gates.

849
01:15:38,753 --> 01:15:40,629
The last of I saw of her,
she was unwell.

850
01:15:40,631 --> 01:15:42,755
The king has ordered that
no one leave or enter.

851
01:16:00,066 --> 01:16:02,901
You see, the queen thinks that
you've lost your wits

852
01:16:02,903 --> 01:16:04,777
but I think your wits
are the one thing

853
01:16:04,779 --> 01:16:07,113
you still have about you.

854
01:16:07,115 --> 01:16:08,115
No!

855
01:16:09,159 --> 01:16:11,492
No-one is going to miss you.

856
01:16:11,494 --> 01:16:15,123
No father, no brother,
no husband.

857
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:18,082
Yes.

858
01:16:18,084 --> 01:16:19,960
We found an old village priest

859
01:16:19,962 --> 01:16:22,129
who, with a little persuasion

860
01:16:22,131 --> 01:16:24,798
had a very strange tale to tell.

861
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:27,511
He says that you have a husband.

862
01:16:30,055 --> 01:16:33,142
And that he himself
made you a wife.

863
01:16:36,811 --> 01:16:39,520
Now, if you were my child..

864
01:16:39,522 --> 01:16:42,484
Your only child died
before he drew breath.

865
01:16:43,985 --> 01:16:45,194
Yes, a son.

866
01:16:46,613 --> 01:16:49,700
They called his mother a witch
and made to burn her.

867
01:16:51,952 --> 01:16:53,870
But you know so already.

868
01:16:55,163 --> 01:16:57,997
It was you that
cried witchcraft.

869
01:16:57,999 --> 01:17:00,207
It was you that turned
the village against the woman

870
01:17:00,209 --> 01:17:01,462
who loved you.

871
01:17:04,172 --> 01:17:05,840
My Lord, we heard a cry.

872
01:17:14,850 --> 01:17:17,768
Your bride is

873
01:17:17,770 --> 01:17:19,227
more than a handful.

874
01:17:19,229 --> 01:17:21,188
Our wedding is today,
Your Majesty.

875
01:17:21,190 --> 01:17:24,568
You will not want to
marry a traitor.

876
01:17:31,824 --> 01:17:32,867
Leave us.

877
01:17:43,378 --> 01:17:45,545
You dare not harm me.

878
01:17:45,547 --> 01:17:48,130
The king suspects
you of treason.

879
01:17:48,132 --> 01:17:50,218
Punishment for treason
is well known.

880
01:17:51,427 --> 01:17:52,553
It is death.

881
01:17:53,763 --> 01:17:54,931
What a waste.

882
01:17:56,682 --> 01:17:59,309
Perhaps you could take me to
the woods and leave me there.

883
01:17:59,311 --> 01:18:01,063
The king would never know.

884
01:18:33,302 --> 01:18:35,430
He was a good man, your father.

885
01:18:37,266 --> 01:18:39,184
But you are twice him, I think.

886
01:19:11,216 --> 01:19:13,135
Sing with me, Laertes.

887
01:19:20,141 --> 01:19:21,726
My sweet sister, come.

888
01:19:22,394 --> 01:19:24,643
Sit. Be still.

889
01:19:38,952 --> 01:19:39,869
Ooh!

890
01:19:52,132 --> 01:19:55,384
Here's rosemary,
for remembrance.

891
01:19:55,386 --> 01:19:57,012
I hope you remember.

892
01:19:59,181 --> 01:20:01,350
Pansies for your thoughts.

893
01:20:04,019 --> 01:20:07,353
Rue... for your regrets

894
01:20:07,355 --> 01:20:09,188
and your sisters.

895
01:20:09,190 --> 01:20:11,068
And some for me and mine.

896
01:20:13,111 --> 01:20:16,030
Daisies. The day's eye.

897
01:20:16,698 --> 01:20:18,158
All seeing.

898
01:20:19,034 --> 01:20:20,661
Someone sees you.

899
01:20:27,708 --> 01:20:28,875
I'd give you some violets

900
01:20:28,877 --> 01:20:31,547
but they all withered
when my father died.

901
01:20:34,007 --> 01:20:36,215
Faithful Horatio,
will you visit my grave?

902
01:20:36,217 --> 01:20:39,510
- Ophelia.
- Visit me before I am cold.

903
01:20:44,184 --> 01:20:45,599
Be sure to dig me up

904
01:20:45,601 --> 01:20:48,730
and I promise you will get
an excellent anatomy lesson.

905
01:21:00,033 --> 01:21:01,285
Here's fennel..

906
01:21:02,285 --> 01:21:03,412
...for you.

907
01:21:06,998 --> 01:21:08,583
And columbines..

908
01:21:09,877 --> 01:21:11,460
...for flattery.

909
01:21:11,462 --> 01:21:13,964
You'll miss it now
my father's gone.

910
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:21,553
Take her.

- Unhand her!
- Let her be!

914
01:21:32,857 --> 01:21:35,108
The poor thing has gone mad.

915
01:21:35,110 --> 01:21:36,403
Let her be!

916
01:21:43,118 --> 01:21:45,954
Get her out of my sight.

917
01:21:51,793 --> 01:21:54,044
- You follow her.
- Yes, Sire.

918
01:22:03,555 --> 01:22:04,472
Sit.

919
01:22:04,972 --> 01:22:06,015
Eat.

920
01:22:07,601 --> 01:22:10,187
I am no longer hungry.

Where is Hamlet?

936
01:24:45,508 --> 01:24:47,176
I dug you up as you commanded.

937
01:24:52,975 --> 01:24:55,561
I took a venom that
mimics death but mocks it.

938
01:25:02,775 --> 01:25:03,983
Where is Hamlet?

939
01:25:03,985 --> 01:25:05,986
Swiftly,
to his ship before it sails.

940
01:25:05,988 --> 01:25:07,655
I'm not well, Horatio.

941
01:25:13,662 --> 01:25:15,120
What is that?

942
01:25:22,837 --> 01:25:24,254
There are scouts about.

943
01:25:26,842 --> 01:25:29,216
It's our enemies from Norway.

944
01:25:29,218 --> 01:25:31,096
They're advancing
on the castle.

945
01:25:32,847 --> 01:25:35,014
You must warn the court.

946
01:25:35,016 --> 01:25:36,476
I will not leave you.

947
01:25:37,644 --> 01:25:39,935
You must warn them, Horatio.

948
01:25:39,937 --> 01:25:41,313
Go.

949
01:25:41,315 --> 01:25:42,775
I will go on alone.

950
01:25:44,693 --> 01:25:45,651
Ophelia..

951
01:25:46,653 --> 01:25:47,695
...farewell.

952
01:26:04,296 --> 01:26:06,630
I am dying.
Give me the remedy.

953
01:26:08,217 --> 01:26:11,303
- You took the venom?
- Too much, I fear. Please.

954
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:16,973
The wood is full of soldiers.

955
01:26:16,975 --> 01:26:18,599
Soldiers?

956
01:26:18,601 --> 01:26:20,729
Worse still. Drink.

957
01:26:27,569 --> 01:26:28,946
Now be gone.

958
01:26:32,074 --> 01:26:34,159
I have kept your secret.

959
01:26:36,078 --> 01:26:37,704
Claudius came to you.

960
01:26:38,579 --> 01:26:41,207
You helped him murder a king.

961
01:26:43,084 --> 01:26:44,544
He helped himself.

962
01:26:46,046 --> 01:26:47,964
I could never deny him.

963
01:26:48,966 --> 01:26:51,716
Why should I?
I didn't care.

964
01:26:51,718 --> 01:26:53,635
Let them do to each other
whatever they want to

965
01:26:53,637 --> 01:26:55,261
up on their hill.

966
01:26:55,263 --> 01:26:56,390
Even now.

967
01:26:57,598 --> 01:27:00,436
Even that you could not
deny him?

968
01:27:02,855 --> 01:27:05,941
I did love him... once.

969
01:27:11,070 --> 01:27:12,613
And he did love me.

970
01:27:15,033 --> 01:27:17,953
It was he who cried witchcraft
when your baby died.

971
01:27:19,245 --> 01:27:22,205
I have witnessed
his confession.

972
01:27:22,207 --> 01:27:25,751
It was he who set
the mob upon you.

973
01:27:25,753 --> 01:27:29,504
- He would have let you burn.
- No.

974
01:27:29,506 --> 01:27:30,964
No, not him.

975
01:27:30,966 --> 01:27:32,633
He loves power.

976
01:27:33,843 --> 01:27:35,971
That is all he loves.

977
01:27:37,722 --> 01:27:38,848
He mocked me.

978
01:27:43,352 --> 01:27:44,605
He shall burn.

979
01:27:56,658 --> 01:27:57,743
Hold these.

980
01:27:59,494 --> 01:28:02,914
You are in more trouble
than I thought.

981
01:28:22,309 --> 01:28:24,142
Halt right there.

982
01:28:24,144 --> 01:28:25,061
Who are you?

983
01:28:27,855 --> 01:28:29,023
A friend.

984
01:29:02,766 --> 01:29:04,268
Have mercy, spirit.

985
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:08,105
God forgive me, Ophelia.

986
01:29:12,066 --> 01:29:15,443
It is not my blood
you have on your hands.

987
01:29:15,445 --> 01:29:18,779
I did not think Claudius
meant to kill him.

988
01:29:18,781 --> 01:29:20,409
You gave him reason.

989
01:29:23,203 --> 01:29:24,663
I'd lost my own.

990
01:29:25,788 --> 01:29:28,583
He brought your sister to ruin.

991
01:29:30,334 --> 01:29:31,753
Claudius?

992
01:29:33,629 --> 01:29:35,841
You never knew he was
the man she loved?

993
01:29:38,052 --> 01:29:40,471
I thought any man but him.

994
01:29:42,931 --> 01:29:44,725
Oh, my sister!

995
01:29:53,316 --> 01:29:54,943
Absolve me.

996
01:30:03,785 --> 01:30:05,244
Take my hand.

997
01:30:11,502 --> 01:30:13,460
You are solid flesh.

998
01:30:13,462 --> 01:30:16,129
And yet I saw my son
leap into your grave.

999
01:30:16,131 --> 01:30:17,464
Hamlet?

1000
01:30:17,466 --> 01:30:19,508
He left the ship when word
reached him you had died.

1001
01:30:19,510 --> 01:30:21,887
- I must return to Elsinore.
- No, too late.

1002
01:30:23,388 --> 01:30:26,348
Laertes challenged Hamlet in the
matter of your father's death.

1003
01:30:26,350 --> 01:30:29,477
- They are set to fight.
- No.

1004
01:30:31,855 --> 01:30:34,814
Where is my sister?
She will have counsel.

1005
01:30:34,816 --> 01:30:36,441
I cannot wait.

1006
01:30:36,443 --> 01:30:37,818
Hamlet will heed only me.

1007
01:30:37,820 --> 01:30:39,321
Claudius will have you killed.

1008
01:30:41,198 --> 01:30:42,988
But I'm already dead.

1009
01:31:21,070 --> 01:31:22,612
Is all prepared?

1010
01:31:22,614 --> 01:31:24,613
I have anointed your sword.

1011
01:31:24,615 --> 01:31:26,534
Just a touch will do.

1012
01:31:27,869 --> 01:31:29,452
Where is Hamlet?

1013
01:31:29,454 --> 01:31:32,413
- Boy, what's your name?
- Osric, Sire.

1014
01:31:32,415 --> 01:31:35,625
Go fetch Hamlet, bid him come
and start the fight.

1015
01:31:35,627 --> 01:31:36,879
As you wish, Your Majesty.

1016
01:31:38,212 --> 01:31:40,047
You have nothing to fear.

1017
01:31:50,141 --> 01:31:51,726
Shall we wager?

1018
01:31:52,811 --> 01:31:54,980
I have little appetite
for games.

1019
01:31:57,315 --> 01:32:00,358
Then I'll take Laertes,
by your leave.

1020
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:03,072
Hamlet is far the better
swordsman.

1021
01:32:05,199 --> 01:32:07,618
The better man
does not always win.

1022
01:32:18,669 --> 01:32:21,837
There are two sides
struggling in you.

1023
01:32:21,839 --> 01:32:25,552
One is baser, one better.

1024
01:32:32,935 --> 01:32:34,475
Ophelia?

1025
01:32:34,477 --> 01:32:35,895
In the flesh.

1026
01:32:38,065 --> 01:32:40,484
- You live?
- My love.

1027
01:32:47,908 --> 01:32:50,951
You're..
You are like a dream I had.

1028
01:32:50,953 --> 01:32:52,995
And when I woke, it was true.

1029
01:32:57,834 --> 01:32:59,835
You must understand

1030
01:32:59,837 --> 01:33:01,463
I seek not this battle.

1031
01:33:02,297 --> 01:33:03,424
Laertes does.

1032
01:33:04,591 --> 01:33:07,010
And has your own
revenge grown cold?

1033
01:33:08,803 --> 01:33:09,930
No.

1034
01:33:11,723 --> 01:33:14,976
- It burns in me still.
- I feared as much.

1035
01:33:15,977 --> 01:33:17,770
Hamlet, we can escape now.

1036
01:33:18,814 --> 01:33:20,980
We will flee to the convent.

1037
01:33:20,982 --> 01:33:23,567
Not every story must
end with a battle.

1038
01:33:23,569 --> 01:33:24,820
Where are you, Hamlet?

1039
01:33:25,738 --> 01:33:26,821
Come.

1040
01:33:27,573 --> 01:33:28,947
I will.

1041
01:33:28,949 --> 01:33:30,868
- I will.
- Now.

1042
01:33:32,202 --> 01:33:34,827
I swore vengeance.

1043
01:33:34,829 --> 01:33:38,082
You swore to love me
and be mine.

1044
01:33:39,418 --> 01:33:40,502
I am yours.

1045
01:33:42,421 --> 01:33:43,422
Ophelia.

1046
01:33:44,631 --> 01:33:46,881
I will follow you, Ophelia.

1047
01:33:46,883 --> 01:33:47,967
Hamlet!

1048
01:34:04,693 --> 01:34:05,903
Goodbye, my love.

1049
01:34:11,492 --> 01:34:12,616
- Hamlet!
- Hamlet!

1050
01:34:12,618 --> 01:34:13,908
- Hamlet!
- Hamlet!

1051
01:34:13,910 --> 01:34:14,910
- Hamlet!
- Hamlet!

1052
01:34:14,912 --> 01:34:16,536
- Hamlet!
- Hamlet!

1053
01:34:16,538 --> 01:34:17,536
Let him through, My Lord.
