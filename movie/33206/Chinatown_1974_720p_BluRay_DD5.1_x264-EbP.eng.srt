1
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:41,251
Enough's enough, Curly. You can't eat
the Venetian blinds, I just got them.

2
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,470
Down the hatch.

3
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:14,757
- She's no good.
- What can I tell you?

4
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:19,022
When you're right, you're right.
And you're right.

5
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:24,499
I'll pay you the rest next week.
We only caught 60 tons of skipjack.

6
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:28,970
They pay less for skipjack
than albacore tuna.

7
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:34,841
I only brought it up to illustrate a point.
I don't want your last dime.

8
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:39,747
- Thank you, Mr Gittes.
- Call me Jake. Careful driving home.

9
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:45,488
Mrs Mulwray is waiting for you,
with Mr Walsh and Mr Duffy.

10
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,252
Mrs Mulwray, may I present Mr Gittes.

11
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:52,761
- Mrs Mulwray, how do you?
- Mr Gittes.

12
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:56,526
What seems to be the problem?

13
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:01,400
My husband... I believe
is seeing another woman.

14
00:04:02,975 --> 00:04:07,776
No... really?
I am sorry.

15
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,609
Mr Gittes, do you think
we could discuss this alone?

16
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:17,083
I'm afraid not.
These are my operatives, -

17
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,384
- and at some point
they'll have to assist me.

18
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:24,256
- I can't do everything myself.
- Of course not.

19
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:35,374
What makes you certain that your
husband is involved with someone?

20
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,510
A wife can tell.

21
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:43,614
- Do you love your husband?
- Yes, of course.

22
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,478
Then go home and forget everything.

23
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:53,114
I'm sure he loves you too. Do you know
the expression: Let sleeping dogs lie?

24
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:57,888
- You're better off not knowing.
- I have to know.

25
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:05,395
Very well.

26
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:10,599
- What is your husband's first name?
- Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.

27
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:16,339
- Water and Power?
- He's chief engineer.

28
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:19,575
Chief engineer?

29
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:32,254
This type of investigation
can be hard on your pocketbook.

30
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:37,164
- It takes time...
- Money doesn't matter to me.

31
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,204
Okay, we'll see what we can do.

32
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:53,879
Today you can hop a streetcar, and in
25 minutes, you end up in the Pacific.

33
00:05:54,086 --> 00:05:58,352
You can swim in it and fish in it,
but you can't drink it.

34
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:01,823
You can't
irrigate an orange grove with it.

35
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:06,965
We live next door to the ocean,
but we also live on the edge of a desert.

36
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:10,135
Los Angeles is a desert community.

37
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:13,999
Beneath this building is a desert.

38
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:18,405
Without water, the dust will rise up
cover us as though we never existed.

39
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:21,876
The Alto Vallejo can save us from this.

40
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:27,417
I suggest that 81/2 million dollars
is a fair price to pay -

41
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,114
- to keep the desert from our streets,
and not on top of them.

42
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:40,894
Mayor Bagby... Let's hear from
all the departments again.

43
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,161
We'd better take Water and Power first.
Mr Mulwray?

44
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:02,715
In case you've forgotten, over 500 died
when the Van der Lip Dam gave way.

45
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:11,830
This shale is similar to the permeable
shale in the Van der Lip disaster.

46
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:15,660
It couldn't withstand
that kind of pressure.

47
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:19,429
Now you propose
another dirt-banked dam, -

48
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:25,839
- with slopes of 21/2 to 1, 112 feet high,
and a 12,000-acre water surface.

49
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:30,505
Well, it won't hold.
I won't build it, it's that simple.

50
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:34,675
I'm not going to make
the same mistake twice.

51
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:50,902
What the hell are you doing?
Get those goddam things out of here!

52
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:56,302
Tell me where to take them!
You don't have an answer for that.

53
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:02,971
You steal water from the valley,
ruin the grazing, starve the livestock...

54
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:07,642
Who's paying you to do that, Mulwray?
That's what I want to know!

55
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:57,970
- Jeez, he was there all night.
- That's right.

56
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:02,807
I had to go back three times
to pick up the watches.

57
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:12,848
Yesterday he went to three reservoirs,
a men's room, and the Pig & Whistle.

58
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:16,755
The guy's got water on the brain.

59
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:31,036
So what have you got?

60
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:55,432
- This?
- They got into a terrific argument.

61
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:02,605
- What about?
- I don't know. The traffic was loud.

62
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:06,608
I heard one thing though:
"Apple core".

63
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,838
- Apple core?
- Yeah.

64
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:18,180
- Is that what you spent the day doing?
- You said to take pictures, so I did.

65
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:22,884
Let me explain
something to you, Walsh.

66
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:27,532
This business requires
a certain amount of finesse.

67
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:33,595
- What is it, Sophie?
- Duffy's on the phone.

68
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:42,073
- Duff, where are you?
- The buzzard's got a cute little twist.

69
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:48,345
- Slow down. Where are you?
- They're in Echo Park, in a rowboat!

70
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,250
Okay...

71
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:55,555
Echo Park. Water again.

72
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:12,807
Okay, pal,
let's have us a big smile.

73
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,852
You'll love it.

74
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:32,056
When you get this much publicity,
you're practically a movie star.

75
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:41,997
- Look at that, Barn.
- Yeah, the heat's murder.

76
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:45,762
Fools' names and fools' faces.

77
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:53,807
- What's that, pal?
- You've got some way to make a living.

78
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:59,609
- What do you do to make ends meet?
- Mortgages. First National Bank.

79
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:03,845
Did you foreclose
on many families this week?

80
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:08,015
- We don't publish records in the paper.
- Neither do I.

81
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:13,255
- No, you have your press agent do it.
- Is this bimbo a regular customer?

82
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:17,731
I make an honest living. I help people
when they're in a desperate situation.

83
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:22,896
I don't kick families out of their houses
like you bums at the bank do.

84
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:27,704
Maybe you'd like to go outside
and discuss it. What do you think?

85
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:33,874
- Let me tell you about the guy...
- I don't know how it got in the paper.

86
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:37,783
- I make an honest living.
- Of course you do.

87
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:42,427
Anyway, this guy got tired
of screwing his wife.

88
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:48,294
So his friend says he should do
what the Chinese do...

89
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:55,674
Duffy. Hey, Walsh! Sophie,
go to the little girls' room for a minute.

90
00:17:55,874 --> 00:18:00,777
But Mr Gittes...
Yes, Mr Gittes.

91
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:07,475
I want to tell you a story. There's a
guy who's tired of screwing his wife...

92
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:11,087
- Jake, there's a problem.
- Wait a second.

93
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:16,455
His friend says to do it like the Chinese
do it. "How do the Chinese do it?"

94
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:22,157
'Well, first they screw a little bit,
then they read a little Confucius, -

95
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:26,269
- come back, screw a little bit more,
then they stop again..."

96
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:30,965
- Jake!
- Walsh, just listen, you'll love this.

97
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:34,703
'They go back
and they screw a little bit more, -

98
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:39,145
- and then they contemplate the moon.
It makes it more exciting."

99
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:43,583
So now the guy goes home
and starts screwing his own wife.

100
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:49,125
So he screws her a little, then goes out
of the room and reads Life magazine.

101
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:54,527
He goes back in and screws her a bit,
then goes out and smokes a cigarette.

102
00:18:54,733 --> 00:19:01,104
His wife is sore. So the next time he's
going out to look at the moon she says:

103
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:06,539
"Hey, what's the matter with you?
You're screwing just like a Chinaman!"

104
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:10,847
Jesus, that Barney...

105
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:20,013
- Mr Gittes?
- Yes.

106
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,927
Do you know me?

107
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:28,759
Well... I think
I would have remembered.

108
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:34,837
- Have we ever met?
- Well, no.

109
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,804
- Never?
- Never.

110
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:43,073
That's what I thought. I'm Mrs Evelyn
Mulwray. Mr Mulwray's wife.

111
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,513
Not that Mulwray?

112
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,655
Yes, Mr Gittes. That Mulwray.

113
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,816
And since you agree
that we've never met before, -

114
00:19:56,028 --> 00:20:01,489
- you must also agree that I never
hired you to spy on my husband.

115
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,431
I see you like publicity, Mr Gittes.

116
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:08,765
Well, you're going to get it.

117
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:14,344
There's been some misunderstanding.
There's no need to get tough with me...

118
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:19,006
I don't get tough with anyone.
My lawyer does.

119
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:24,481
Here's something for you, Mr Gittes.

120
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:30,524
I suppose we'll be hearing
from your attorney.

121
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:48,606
- Mr Mulwray?
- He's not in, Mr...?

122
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:52,978
- May I ask what it's regarding?
- It's personal. Has he been gone long?

123
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:56,951
- Since lunch.
- Gee whiz, and I'm late.

124
00:20:57,155 --> 00:21:02,616
- He was expecting you?
- 15 minutes ago. I'll go in and wait.

125
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:05,262
Sir!

126
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:41,415
Could I help you?
Russ Yelburton, deputy chief.

127
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:45,722
J.J. Gittes.
It's not a departmental matter.

128
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:49,697
- Would you care to wait in my office?
- Certainly.

129
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:53,701
We're a bit nervous,
with all this business in the papers -

130
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:57,864
- about Mr Mulwray.
Right this way.

131
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:07,044
After you've worked with a man
for a certain length of time, -

132
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:11,188
- you come to know
his habits and values.

133
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:16,053
Either he's the kind who chases
after women, or he isn't.

134
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:21,756
- Mulwray never even kids about it.
- Maybe he takes it very seriously.

135
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:26,833
- Sit down.
- No, thank you.

136
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:31,532
- Where is he having lunch?
- I'm sorry, I don't know.

137
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:36,806
- Well, tell him I'll be back.
- I will.

138
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:42,317
Do you mind if I take one of your cards,
in case I have to get in touch with you?

139
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:52,553
- Mulvihill, what are you doing here?
- They shut my water off. So what?

140
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:58,066
How'd you find out? You don't drink it,
you don't take a bath in it...

141
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:03,435
They wrote you a letter... But then
you'd have to be able to read.

142
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:07,037
Relax, glad to see you.

143
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:11,443
- Do you know Claude Mulvihill?
- I hope so, he's working for us.

144
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:15,984
- Doing what?
- There's been threats to the reservoirs.

145
00:24:16,187 --> 00:24:21,591
- Any particular reason?
- Rationing. The farmers are desperate.

146
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:26,560
- But the city needs drinking water.
- Well, you're in luck.

147
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:32,726
When he was sheriff, the rum runners
landed tons of booze on the beach -

148
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:38,467
- and never lost a drop. He ought to be
able to hold on to your water for you.

149
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:42,402
J.J. Gittes to see Mr Mulwray.

150
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,656
Please.

151
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:24,948
You wait.

152
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:29,647
- Bad for glass.
- Yeah, sure.

153
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:32,817
Bad for the glass.

154
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:13,323
- Mr Gittes.
- Actually, I came to see your husband.

155
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:19,121
- Something to drink?
- What are you having?

156
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:23,699
- Iced tea.
- That'll be fine, thank you.

157
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:29,704
My husband's at the office.

158
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:34,902
Actually, he's not. And he's checked
out of his apartment at the El Macondo.

159
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:37,638
That's not his apartment.

160
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:44,486
Anyway, the point is,
I'm not in business to be loved, -

161
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:49,183
- but I am in business. Whoever
set your husband up, set me up.

162
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:54,457
L.A. Is a small town. People talk.
I don't want to become a local joke.

163
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:58,500
You've talked me into it.
I'll drop the lawsuit.

164
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:03,072
- What?
- Let's just drop the whole thing.

165
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:08,871
- Sugar, lemon, or both?
- Both... I don't want to drop it.

166
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,848
I better talk to your husband.

167
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:18,284
Why? Hollis seems to think
you're an innocent man.

168
00:29:18,489 --> 00:29:23,552
I've been accused of a lot of things,
but never that.

169
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:27,925
Someone's gone to a lot of trouble,
and I intend to find out.

170
00:29:28,132 --> 00:29:31,533
I'm not supposed to be the one
caught with his pants down.

171
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:36,139
Unless it's a problem,
I'd like to talk to your husband.

172
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:41,210
- May I speak frankly, Mrs Mulwray?
- You may if you can, Mr Gittes.

173
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:46,247
That little girlfriend. She was pretty,
in a cheap sort of way, of course...

174
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,420
She's disappeared.
Maybe they disappeared together.

175
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:54,615
- If they did, how does that affect you?
- It's nothing personal.

176
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:59,263
It's very personal.
It couldn't be more personal.

177
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:03,491
- Is this an obsession with you?
- Let's look at it this way...

178
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:08,695
This phoney broad, excuse
the language, tells me she's you.

179
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:13,742
Whoever put her up to it isn't after me,
they're out to get your husband.

180
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:17,608
If I can see him, I can help him.

181
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:24,112
- Did you talk to him this morning?
- No.

182
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:27,086
I went riding rather early.

183
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:32,127
- It looks like you went quite a distance.
- I was riding bareback.

184
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:37,097
You might try the Oak Pass
or the Stone Canyon Reservoir.

185
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:40,738
He often takes walks.
Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.

186
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:44,340
- I'll stop by.
- Please call first.

187
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:03,293
Sorry, closed to public.

188
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:06,986
That's all right, officer...

189
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:10,861
Russ Yelburton,
Deputy Chief of the department.

190
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:14,732
Sorry, Mr Yelburton.
Go on down.

191
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:44,766
- Gittes, get out before he sees you.
- Loach, what's going on?

192
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:52,672
- Hello, Jake.
- Lou. How are you?

193
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:58,406
Lousy cold I can't seem to shake,
but otherwise I'm okay.

194
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:02,712
- Summer colds are the worst.
- Yeah, they are.

195
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:07,254
- There's no smoking here.
- We'll make an exception this time.

196
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:12,418
I'll see he's careful with the matches
and doesn't burn himself.

197
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,565
How'd you get past the guard?

198
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:19,464
To tell you the truth, I lied a little.

199
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:23,629
- You look like you've done well.
- I get by.

200
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:28,335
Sometimes it takes a man a while
to find himself. Maybe you have.

201
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:32,915
Yeah, going through
other people's dirty linen.

202
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:38,248
Tell me, you still putting Chinamen
in jail for spitting in the laundry?

203
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:43,018
You're a little behind the times.
They use steam irons now.

204
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:45,957
And I'm out of Chinatown.

205
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:50,726
- Since when?
- Since I made lieutenant.

206
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:53,597
Congratulations.

207
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:58,868
- What are you doing around here?
- I'm looking for somebody.

208
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:03,138
- Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
- Yeah.

209
00:33:03,347 --> 00:33:08,114
- I'd like to talk to him.
- You'd like to talk to him...

210
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:15,321
You're welcome to try.
There he is.

211
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:37,640
It looks like he was washed down
the entire length of the run-off channel.

212
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,943
- Could he swim?
- Of course.

213
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:46,454
Obviously, the fall must have
knocked him unconscious.

214
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:52,357
Mrs Mulwray, this alleged affair
your husband was having...

215
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:58,829
The publicity didn't make him
morose or unhappy?

216
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:02,700
It didn't make him happy.

217
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:06,968
- He couldn't have taken his own life?
- No.

218
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:14,512
Do you happen to know the name
of the young lady in question?

219
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,481
- No.
- Or where she might be?

220
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:23,990
You and your husband
never discussed her?

221
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:30,867
We did.
He wouldn't tell me her name.

222
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:35,505
We quarrelled over her, of course.
It came as a complete surprise to me.

223
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:40,473
A complete surprise? I thought
you hired a private investigator.

224
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:44,045
A private investigator?

225
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,978
Mr Gittes.

226
00:34:51,455 --> 00:34:57,826
Yes, but I did that to put an end to
a ridiculous rumour that had no basis.

227
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:06,102
When did Mr Gittes inform you that the
rumours had some foundation in fact?

228
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:09,535
Just before the story broke
in the papers.

229
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:14,734
You wouldn't happen to know where
I could find her... or her name?

230
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:18,177
- No.
- Of course not.

231
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:22,682
- Will you need me for anything else?
- No, I don't think so.

232
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:26,846
If we need any more information
we'll be in touch.

233
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:30,755
Of course you have
my deepest sympathy.

234
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:35,228
I'll see her to the car, Lou.
I'll be right back.

235
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:39,832
- Jake, what's the story?
- Take it easy.

236
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:45,031
We better do this in a hurry...
Give us a little room!

237
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:50,970
You want a picture, guys?
Here it is. "Gittes", two T's and an E.

238
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:55,544
Thank you for going along with me
back there.

239
00:35:55,753 --> 00:36:00,281
I just didn't want to explain anything.
I'll send you a check.

240
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:05,121
- A check?
- To make it official that I've hired you.

241
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:26,375
I'll have it this afternoon...
Jake, what are you doing here?

242
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:31,385
It's my lunch hour, Morty. I thought I'd
drop by and see who'd dropped dead.

243
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:35,753
Middle of a drought,
and the water commissioner drowns.

244
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,726
- Only in L.A.
- Looks pretty banged up.

245
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:42,990
Well, it's a long fall.

246
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:50,173
So how are you doing, Morty?

247
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:53,434
Never better, except for this cough.

248
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:57,102
- You know me, Jake.
- Yeah.

249
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:08,851
- So who have you got there?
- Leroy Shuhardt. Local drunk.

250
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:13,463
Used to hang around Ferguson's Alley.

251
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:19,125
Quite a character. Lately he's been
living in a downtown storm drain.

252
00:37:20,971 --> 00:37:25,738
Had a bureau dresser down there
and everything.

253
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:35,980
He drowned too.

254
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:40,590
- Come again?
- Got drunk. Passed out in the riverbed.

255
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:45,751
- The L.A. River?
- Yeah, what's wrong with that?

256
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:50,764
- It's dry as a bone.
- It's not completely dry.

257
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:56,065
He ain't gonna drown in a damp
riverbed, no matter how soused he is.

258
00:37:56,273 --> 00:37:59,265
We got water out of him. He drowned.

259
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:59,128
Hello.

260
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:11,214
Howdy. You were riding out here
the other day, weren't you?

261
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:17,582
- Do you speak English? Habla Ingles?
- Si.

262
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:22,748
You were talking to a man
a few days ago. He wore glasses...

263
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:29,263
- What did you talk about?
- The water.

264
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:33,801
- What about the water?
- When it comes.

265
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:38,498
- What did you tell him?
- It comes in different parts of the river.

266
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:42,042
Every night a different part.

267
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:06,954
Son of a bitch.
Goddam Florsheim shoe.

268
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,826
Hold it there, kitty cat.

269
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:27,735
Hello, Claude.
Where'd you get the midget?

270
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:35,509
You're a very nosy fellow.
Know what happens to nosy fellows?

271
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:39,416
No? Wanna guess?

272
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:43,252
No? Okay.
They lose their noses.

273
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:50,065
Next time you lose the whole thing.

274
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:55,330
I'll cut it off
and feed it to my goldfish. Understand?

275
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:59,664
- Understand?
- I understand.

276
00:43:11,955 --> 00:43:16,892
So a contractor wants to build a dam
and makes a few pay-offs. So what?

277
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:20,393
You can't nail Mulvihill.
They'll claim you were trespassing.

278
00:43:20,597 --> 00:43:25,193
I don't want Mulvihill. I want the
big boys that are making the pay-offs.

279
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:30,237
- Then what'll you do?
- Sue the shit out of them.

280
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:35,803
- What is it, Sophie?
- A Miss Sessions is calling.

281
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:39,380
- Who?
- Ida Sessions.

282
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:42,552
Don't know her. Take a number.

283
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:48,714
People like that will be having dinner
with the judge who's trying the suit.

284
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:52,191
I'm sorry. Miss Sessions insists.

285
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:55,729
- She says you know her.
- Okay.

286
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:03,698
Hello, Miss Sessions.
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

287
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:08,742
- Oh yes we have. Are you alone?
- Isn't everyone?

288
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:12,211
What can I do for you?

289
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:16,944
Well, I'm a working girl. I didn't
come in to see you on my own.

290
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:22,114
- When did you come in?
- I pretended to be Mrs Mulwray.

291
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:26,660
Shut the fuck up...
Yes, I remember.

292
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:32,302
- Is something wrong?
- I was just checking with an associate.

293
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:38,135
- Go on.
- I never expected all this to happen.

294
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:43,575
If it gets out, I want someone to know
that I didn't know what would happen.

295
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:48,912
I understand. Who was your employer?
It would be helpful to both of us.

296
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,747
Oh, no. No.

297
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:56,056
What's your address?
Maybe we could talk this over.

298
00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:01,493
Just look in the obituary column
of today's L.A. Post-Record.

299
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:05,964
You'll find one of those people.

300
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:11,102
Sure...
How do you like them apples?

301
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:52,874
Thank you for coming.

302
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:01,285
- Yes, sir?
- Drink?

303
00:46:01,491 --> 00:46:05,120
Tom Collins with lime, not lemon.

304
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:13,135
I got your check in the mail.

305
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:18,832
- As I said, I was very grateful.
- I'm afraid that's not good enough.

306
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:28,244
- How much would you like?
- Oh, stop it. The money's fine.

307
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:34,755
But I think you short-changed me
on the story.

308
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:39,793
Something else besides the death
of your husband was bothering you.

309
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:45,492
- You were upset, but not that upset.
- Don't tell me how I feel.

310
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:51,468
Sorry.

311
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:56,237
You sue me, your husband dies,
you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato.

312
00:46:56,446 --> 00:47:02,078
All of it quicker than the wind
from a duck's ass. Excuse me...

313
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:06,882
- Then you ask me to lie to the police.
- It wasn't much of a lie.

314
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:12,619
If he was killed, it was. This could look
like a pay-off to withhold evidence.

315
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:15,798
But he wasn't killed.

316
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:21,001
Mrs Mulwray,
I think you're hiding something.

317
00:47:28,845 --> 00:47:33,680
I suppose I am.
Actually, I knew about the affair.

318
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:38,279
- How did you find out?
- My husband.

319
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:43,221
He told you? And you weren't
in the least bit upset?

320
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:46,555
I was grateful.

321
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:51,029
- You'll have to explain that.
- Why?

322
00:47:51,234 --> 00:47:56,103
When a wife tells me she's happy
that her husband is cheating on her, -

323
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:59,901
- it runs contrary to my experience.

324
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:05,639
- Unless what?
- She was cheating on him.

325
00:48:08,618 --> 00:48:11,052
Were you?

326
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:18,526
I dislike the word "cheat".

327
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:23,462
Did you have affairs?
Did he know about it?

328
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:29,699
I wouldn't run home and tell him
whenever I'd been to bed with another.

329
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:35,276
- Anything else you want to know?
- Where were you when Hollis died?

330
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:38,846
- I can't tell you.
- You don't know?

331
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:42,314
- I can't tell you.
- You were seeing someone too.

332
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:49,151
- For very long?
- I don't see anyone for very long.

333
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:52,726
It's difficult for me.

334
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:59,859
Now, I think you know
all you need know about me.

335
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:05,440
I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to
go into all of this then, or now.

336
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:08,770
Is that all?

337
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:14,815
Oh, by the way...
What does this "C" stand for?

338
00:49:16,686 --> 00:49:19,587
Cross.

339
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:24,090
- That's your maiden name?
- Yes. Why?

340
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,387
No reason.

341
00:49:26,596 --> 00:49:30,794
- You must have had a reason to ask.
- No, I'm just a snoop.

342
00:49:35,939 --> 00:49:39,739
No, I have my own car. The Packard.

343
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:45,438
Wait a minute, sonny.
I think you better come with me.

344
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:49,983
There's nothing more to say.
Get my car, please.

345
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:56,649
Okay, but in case you're interested,
your husband was murdered.

346
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:00,694
Someone's been dumping thousands
of tons of water from the reservoirs, -

347
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:05,800
- and we're supposedly in a drought.
He found out about it and he was killed.

348
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:11,531
There's a drowned drunk. Involuntary
manslaughter, if anyone took the time.

349
00:50:11,741 --> 00:50:16,769
It seems like half the city is trying
to cover it up, which is fine by me, -

350
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:21,041
- but I goddam near lost my nose.

351
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:24,516
And I like it.
I like breathing through it.

352
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:29,158
And I still think
that you're hiding something.

353
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,933
Mr Gittes...

354
00:50:47,777 --> 00:50:51,577
J.J. Gittes to see Mr Yelburton.

355
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:24,142
Mr Yelburton will be busy
for some time.

356
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:28,078
Well, it's my lunch hour. I can wait.

357
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:31,618
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.

358
00:51:31,821 --> 00:51:36,815
I take a long lunch hour.
All day, sometimes.

359
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:42,389
- Noah Cross worked for the company?
- Yes... No.

360
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:47,086
- Did he or didn't he?
- He owned it.

361
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:51,734
- He owned the water department?
- Yes.

362
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:57,965
You mean, he owned
the entire water supply for the city?

363
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:08,174
- How'd they get it away from him?
- Mulwray felt the public should own it.

364
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:13,015
Mr Mulwray?
I thought you said Cross owned it.

365
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:16,659
Along with Mr Mulwray.

366
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:21,888
- They were partners?
- Yes, they were partners.

367
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:01,895
Mr Yelburton will see you now.

368
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:11,237
Mr Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting.
These staff meetings just go on and on.

369
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:16,476
It must be especially tough to take over
under these circumstances.

370
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:21,282
Yes, Hollis was the best
department chief the city ever had.

371
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:26,554
- What happened to your nose?
- Cut myself shaving.

372
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:31,462
- That must really smart.
- Only when I breathe.

373
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:41,266
Only when you breathe... Don't tell me
you're still working for Mrs Mulwray?

374
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:44,413
- I never was.
- I don't understand.

375
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:48,311
Neither do I, actually.
You hired me.

376
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:52,420
Or you hired that chippie to hire me.

377
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:58,857
- You're not making a bit of sense.
- Let's look at it this way:

378
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:03,795
Mulwray didn't want to build a dam.
His reputation was hard to get around.

379
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,165
You decided to ruin it. Then he found
out you were dumping water at night.

380
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:12,637
Then he was... drowned.

381
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:18,405
That's an outrageous accusation.
I don't know what you're talking about.

382
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:22,984
Well, Whitey Mehrholtz
over at the Times will.

383
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:28,920
Dumping thousands of gallons of water
in the middle of a drought is news.

384
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,928
Mr Gittes...

385
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:38,590
We're not anxious for it to get around,
but we have been diverting water -

386
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:42,169
- to irrigate orange groves
in the Northwest Valley.

387
00:55:42,372 --> 00:55:48,242
They have no legal right to our water,
but we've been trying to help them out.

388
00:55:48,445 --> 00:55:51,676
When you divert water,
there's a little run-off.

389
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:57,317
Yeah, a little run-off...
Where did you say those groves were?

390
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:02,287
- In the Northwest Valley.
- That's like saying they're in Arizona.

391
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:07,327
My field men are out,
I can't give you the exact location.

392
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:13,594
You're a married man, aren't you?
Hard working, wife, kids...?

393
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:18,172
- Yes.
- I don't want to nail you.

394
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:27,475
I want to find out who put you up to it.
I'll give you a few days to think on it.

395
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:32,644
Call me, I can help. Who knows,
maybe we can put the whole thing off -

396
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:39,227
- on a few big shots, and you can stay
head of the department for 20 years.

397
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:23,865
- Drink?
- No, thank you.

398
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:30,069
What is your usual salary?

399
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:34,979
$35 a day, plus 20 for my associates.

400
00:57:35,184 --> 00:57:40,816
Plus expenses,
plus a bonus if I show results.

401
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:47,554
Whoever killed my husband,
why have they gone to all this trouble?

402
00:57:47,764 --> 00:57:53,794
Money. How they plan to make it
emptying reservoirs, I don't know.

403
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:57,962
I'll pay your salary, plus $5,000, -

404
00:57:58,174 --> 00:58:02,668
- if you find out what happened
to Hollis, and who is involved.

405
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:12,612
Sophie, draw up one of our
standard contracts for Mrs Mulwray.

406
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:23,526
Were you married before Mulwray and
your father sold the water department?

407
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:27,567
Noah Cross is your father, isn't he?

408
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:31,665
Yes, of course.

409
00:58:31,874 --> 00:58:38,040
It was sometime after. I was just out
of grade school when they did that.

410
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:44,417
Then you married
your father's business partner.

411
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:49,481
You've already got one going.

412
00:58:50,793 --> 00:58:54,889
Does my talking about your father
upset you?

413
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:57,191
No...

414
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:02,303
Yes, a little.
You see, Hollis and my fa...

415
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:07,943
...my father
had a falling out, finally.

416
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:13,411
- Over you or the water department?
- Why should it be over me?

417
00:59:13,616 --> 00:59:16,813
Then it was over the water department.

418
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:23,516
Hollis felt the water should belong to
the public. I think my father disagreed.

419
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:29,130
Actually, it was over the
Van der Lip Dam. The dam that broke.

420
00:59:29,332 --> 00:59:33,860
- Hollis never forgave him for it.
- Never forgave him for what?

421
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:39,667
For talking him into building it.
They never spoke from that time on.

422
00:59:42,945 --> 00:59:45,607
You sure about that?

423
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:48,477
Of course I'm sure.

424
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:54,688
Sign here.

425
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:57,018
The copy's for you.

426
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:04,415
Mr Gittes?
How do you do?

427
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:10,122
- You got a nasty reputation. I like that.
- Thanks.

428
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:16,795
You're not a bank president. In your
business it's good advertising.

429
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:21,636
- It doesn't hurt.
- It helps get a client like my daughter.

430
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:25,780
- Probably.
- I'm surprised you still work for her.

431
01:01:25,982 --> 01:01:29,509
Unless she's suddenly come up
with another husband.

432
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:33,815
She happens to think
the last one was murdered.

433
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:39,552
- How did she get that idea?
- I think I gave it to her.

434
01:01:39,762 --> 01:01:44,631
I hope you don't mind. I believe
they should be served with the head.

435
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:49,066
As long as you don't
serve the chicken that way.

436
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:52,537
Tell me, what do the police say?

437
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:55,836
They're calling it an accident.

438
01:01:56,045 --> 01:02:00,072
- Who's the investigating officer?
- Lt. Lou Escobar.

439
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:03,116
- You know him?
- Oh, yeah.

440
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:08,655
- Where from?
- We worked together, in Chinatown.

441
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:14,826
- Would you call him a capable man?
- Very.

442
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:18,467
- Honest?
- As far as it goes.

443
01:02:18,668 --> 01:02:22,468
He has to swim
in the same water we all do.

444
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:27,006
But there's no reason to think
he's bungled the case?

445
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:31,044
- Too bad.
- Too bad?

446
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:34,944
It makes me think you're
taking my daughter for a ride, -

447
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:38,245
- financially speaking, of course.

448
01:02:38,454 --> 01:02:41,685
What are you charging her?

449
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:46,225
My usual fee,
plus a bonus if I get results.

450
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:50,263
Are you sleeping with her?

451
01:02:51,133 --> 01:02:54,728
You have to think about that
to remember?

452
01:02:57,473 --> 01:03:03,070
If you want an answer to that question,
I'll put one of my men on the job.

453
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:08,112
- Good afternoon.
- Mr Gittes...

454
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:14,051
She's just lost her husband.
I don't want her taken advantage of.

455
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:17,488
- Sit down.
- What for?

456
01:03:18,861 --> 01:03:23,696
You may think you know what you're
dealing with, but believe me, you don't.

457
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:30,371
- Why is that funny?
- The DA used to say that in Chinatown.

458
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:33,542
Was he right?

459
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:38,112
Exactly what do you know about me?
Sit down.

460
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:47,847
You're rich, and too respectable
to want your name in the newspapers.

461
01:03:48,057 --> 01:03:51,424
Of course I'm respectable. I'm old.

462
01:03:51,627 --> 01:03:57,293
Politicians, ugly buildings and whores
get respectable if they last a long time.

463
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:03,632
I'll double your fee and pay you
$10,000 if you find Hollis's girlfriend.

464
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:07,969
- Girlfriend?
- Disappeared, hasn't she?

465
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:12,773
- Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
- Maybe.

466
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:19,013
If he was murdered,
she may be the last to see him alive.

467
01:04:19,221 --> 01:04:22,520
When was the last time you saw him?

468
01:04:22,725 --> 01:04:25,717
Sheriff's gold posse. Damn fools.

469
01:04:25,928 --> 01:04:30,331
They paid $5,000 apiece
toward the sheriff's re-election.

470
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:34,333
I let them practice up here.

471
01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:42,768
- Do you know when you last saw him?
- At my age you tend to forget.

472
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:49,214
Five days ago, at the Pig & Whistle.
You had one hell of an argument.

473
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:54,856
I got the pictures in my office,
if that'll help you remember.

474
01:04:56,325 --> 01:05:01,024
- What did you argue about?
- My daughter.

475
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:06,862
- What about her?
- Just find the girl, Mr Gittes.

476
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:17,209
I know Hollis was fond of her.
I'd like to help her if I can.

477
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:22,146
I had no idea you and Hollis
were that fond of one another.

478
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:27,846
Hollis Mulwray made this city,
and he made me a fortune.

479
01:05:29,058 --> 01:05:33,688
We were a lot closer
than Evelyn realised.

480
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:40,698
If you want to hire me, I still have
to know what the argument was about.

481
01:05:40,903 --> 01:05:46,535
My daughter's very jealous. I didn't
want her to find out about the girl.

482
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:53,011
- How did you find out?
- I've still got a few friends in town.

483
01:05:55,684 --> 01:05:58,118
Okay...

484
01:05:58,888 --> 01:06:04,554
I'll have my secretary
draw up the papers.

485
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:11,165
Are you frightened for the girl
or what Evelyn might do to her?

486
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:14,564
Just find the girl.

487
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:20,436
I'll look into it, as soon as
I've checked out some orange groves.

488
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:25,342
- Orange groves?
- We'll be in touch, Mr Cross.

489
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:35,787
Could you tell me where the plat
books for the Northwest Valley are?

490
01:06:35,988 --> 01:06:40,391
Part of it's in Ventura County. We don't
have them in our Hall of Records.

491
01:06:41,694 --> 01:06:44,663
Then I'll settle for L.A. County.

492
01:06:44,864 --> 01:06:47,992
Row 23, section C.

493
01:06:52,238 --> 01:06:54,331
Weasel.

494
01:07:48,761 --> 01:07:55,724
Sonny, why do they have all those
names pasted in the plat books?

495
01:07:55,935 --> 01:07:59,336
Land sales out of escrow
are recorded within the week.

496
01:07:59,539 --> 01:08:03,839
- Then these are all new owners?
- That's right.

497
01:08:04,043 --> 01:08:09,913
That means that most of the Valley's
sold in the last few months.

498
01:08:10,883 --> 01:08:13,852
Can I check one of these volumes out?

499
01:08:14,053 --> 01:08:18,513
This is not a lending library,
it's the Hall of Records.

500
01:08:18,724 --> 01:08:22,182
- How about a ruler?
- A ruler?

501
01:08:22,395 --> 01:08:29,198
The print's fine, and I left my glasses at
home. I'd like to be able to read across.

502
01:08:40,813 --> 01:08:43,748
I thank you.

503
01:09:49,782 --> 01:09:52,512
Hold it right there!

504
01:10:59,885 --> 01:11:04,686
All right, quit it now!
Search the man, see if he's armed.

505
01:11:17,870 --> 01:11:21,533
I didn't tell you
to empty his pockets.

506
01:11:21,741 --> 01:11:26,269
- Search him!
- He ain't armed.

507
01:11:26,479 --> 01:11:31,542
Who are you with, the Water
Department or the real estate office?

508
01:11:31,751 --> 01:11:36,381
Get away from me! Come near me with
that again, you'll need a pair of them!

509
01:11:36,589 --> 01:11:41,822
- Pick on somebody your own size.
- Give him a chance to say something.

510
01:11:45,798 --> 01:11:50,929
The name's Gittes, private investigator.
I'm not with either one of them.

511
01:11:52,171 --> 01:11:55,436
What are you doing out here?

512
01:11:55,641 --> 01:12:01,011
A client hired me to see if the Water
Department was irrigating your land.

513
01:12:01,213 --> 01:12:05,513
The Water Dept.'s been sending people
out here to blow up my water tanks.

514
01:12:05,718 --> 01:12:09,484
They put poison in my wells.
That's a funny way to irrigate.

515
01:12:09,688 --> 01:12:13,215
Who'd hire you for a thing like that?

516
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:21,992
- Mrs Evelyn Mulwray.
- That's the one who's done it to us.

517
01:12:22,201 --> 01:12:26,638
Mulwray's dead. You don't know what
you're talking about, you dumb Okie.

518
01:12:34,213 --> 01:12:37,011
Well, that's that.

519
01:13:02,741 --> 01:13:05,175
What's going on?

520
01:13:05,377 --> 01:13:09,143
You didn't look good. We thought
we better call your employer.

521
01:13:13,886 --> 01:13:17,322
Thanks for coming.

522
01:13:20,426 --> 01:13:25,523
That dam your husband opposed
is a con job.

523
01:13:25,731 --> 01:13:31,067
They're conning L.A. Into building it,
but the water's coming here, not to L.A.

524
01:13:31,270 --> 01:13:36,902
Everything you can see. All around us.
I was at the Hall of Records today.

525
01:13:42,581 --> 01:13:46,574
In the last three months,
Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres.

526
01:13:46,785 --> 01:13:53,691
Emma Dill: 12,000. C. Speer: 5,000.
Jasper Lamar Crabb: 25,000 acres.

527
01:13:53,893 --> 01:13:58,159
Jasper Lamar Crabb? I think
I would have remembered that name.

528
01:13:58,397 --> 01:14:03,266
They're blowing the farmers out
and then buying their land for peanuts.

529
01:14:03,469 --> 01:14:07,633
You know what this land would
be worth with a steady water supply?

530
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:12,573
About 30 million more
than they paid for it.

531
01:14:12,778 --> 01:14:17,613
- Hollis knew about this?
- That's why he was killed.

532
01:14:17,816 --> 01:14:22,981
Jasper Lamar Crabb...

533
01:14:25,457 --> 01:14:28,517
- We got it.
- What is it?

534
01:14:28,727 --> 01:14:32,788
"A memorial was held at the
Mar Vista Inn for Jasper Lamar Crabb."

535
01:14:32,998 --> 01:14:37,628
- He passed away two weeks ago.
- Is that unusual?

536
01:14:37,836 --> 01:14:42,330
He passed away two weeks ago.
One week ago he bought the land.

537
01:14:42,541 --> 01:14:44,941
That's unusual.

538
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:31,617
Hello, I'm Mr Palmer.
Can I help you folks?

539
01:15:31,824 --> 01:15:34,987
Yes, I hope so.

540
01:15:35,194 --> 01:15:40,791
- It's Dad. I can't handle him anymore.
- My goodness.

541
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:45,937
- It's nothing with Dad, it's me.
- Dad's an angel with everyone else.

542
01:15:46,138 --> 01:15:49,232
- But when he and my h...
- I don't know.

543
01:15:49,441 --> 01:15:54,208
Of course, I'm anxious for him
to have the best. Money is no object.

544
01:15:54,413 --> 01:15:59,851
- Perhaps if we met with your father.
- There is one question...

545
01:16:00,052 --> 01:16:04,216
Do you accept people
of the Jewish persuasion?

546
01:16:04,423 --> 01:16:10,123
- I'm sorry, but we don't.
- Neither does Dad. We had to be sure.

547
01:16:10,329 --> 01:16:15,232
Would it be possible to see a list
of your patients, just to be certain?

548
01:16:15,434 --> 01:16:19,427
We never reveal
the names of our guests. It's policy.

549
01:16:19,638 --> 01:16:26,066
- You'd agree if your father lived here.
- Exactly what I wanted to hear you say.

550
01:16:26,278 --> 01:16:30,237
- Is it too late for us to look around?
- No, allow me to show you.

551
01:16:30,449 --> 01:16:35,113
- Could we stroll on our own?
- Yes, if you stay in the main building.

552
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:38,255
- It's almost bedtime.
- We understand.

553
01:16:39,291 --> 01:16:42,124
Come, my sweet.

554
01:16:53,205 --> 01:16:57,437
Charley, you ought to know
better than that.

555
01:17:17,296 --> 01:17:21,528
They're all there. Every goddam name.

556
01:17:26,438 --> 01:17:31,705
You're looking at the owners
of a 50,000 acre empire.

557
01:17:36,215 --> 01:17:40,379
They may not know it,
but they are.

558
01:17:40,586 --> 01:17:42,952
Hello, girls.

559
01:17:43,155 --> 01:17:46,386
Are any of you Emma Dill?

560
01:17:46,592 --> 01:17:49,083
Are you Emma?

561
01:17:49,294 --> 01:17:52,923
- I've wanted to meet you a long time.
- Why?

562
01:17:53,132 --> 01:17:57,762
- Did you know you were very wealthy?
- I'm not.

563
01:17:57,970 --> 01:18:01,963
- You own a lot of land.
- No more.

564
01:18:02,174 --> 01:18:06,270
Some time ago, my late husband
owned a lot of beach property, -

565
01:18:06,478 --> 01:18:09,470
- but we lost it.

566
01:18:09,681 --> 01:18:15,119
That's very beautiful. Where
did you get this piece of material?

567
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:17,948
At the Albacore Club.

568
01:18:18,157 --> 01:18:22,992
Albacore. It's a fish.

569
01:18:23,195 --> 01:18:27,655
My grandson is a member.
They take very nice care of us.

570
01:18:27,866 --> 01:18:33,395
- How do they do that?
- Give us things. Not just a flag, but...

571
01:18:33,605 --> 01:18:38,770
- But what?
- We're an unofficial charity to them.

572
01:18:39,812 --> 01:18:44,647
Would you come with me?
Someone wants to talk with you.

573
01:18:46,819 --> 01:18:49,344
Goodbye, ladies.

574
01:18:57,196 --> 01:19:00,188
I want you to meet someone, Gittes.

575
01:19:00,399 --> 01:19:03,926
- Can we leave the lady out of this?
- Yeah, why not.

576
01:19:04,136 --> 01:19:07,799
- I'd like to see her to the car.
- She knows where it's at.

577
01:19:08,006 --> 01:19:11,908
- I'll stay.
- Get in the car.

578
01:20:31,723 --> 01:20:34,487
Maid's night off?

579
01:20:34,693 --> 01:20:38,754
- Why?
- Because nobody's here, that's why.

580
01:20:38,964 --> 01:20:42,058
I gave everyone the night off.

581
01:20:42,267 --> 01:20:47,500
- Easy, it's an innocent question.
- No question from you is innocent.

582
01:20:47,706 --> 01:20:50,834
I guess you're right.

583
01:20:52,344 --> 01:20:55,313
To you, Mrs Mulwray.

584
01:20:55,514 --> 01:21:00,213
Frankly, tonight you saved my a...
you saved my neck.

585
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:08,949
Tell me, Mr Gittes,
does this often happen to you?

586
01:21:10,696 --> 01:21:12,994
What's that?

587
01:21:13,198 --> 01:21:18,295
I'm judging only on part of today, but
if this is how you go about your work, -

588
01:21:18,503 --> 01:21:22,496
- I'd say you'd be lucky
to get through a whole day.

589
01:21:23,742 --> 01:21:28,441
- This hasn't happened for a long time.
- When was the last time?

590
01:21:28,647 --> 01:21:33,380
- Why?
- It's an innocent question.

591
01:21:37,923 --> 01:21:43,259
- In Chinatown.
- What were you doing there?

592
01:21:43,462 --> 01:21:47,057
- Working for the District Attorney.
- Doing what?

593
01:21:47,265 --> 01:21:52,669
- As little as possible.
- The DA gives you advice like that?

594
01:21:52,871 --> 01:21:55,931
They do in Chinatown.

595
01:21:56,141 --> 01:22:00,009
Why did you leave the police force?

596
01:22:02,447 --> 01:22:08,044
Do you have any peroxide,
or anything like that?

597
01:22:08,253 --> 01:22:11,450
Surely. Come this way.

598
01:22:28,907 --> 01:22:32,035
God!

599
01:22:33,378 --> 01:22:36,609
That's a nasty cut.

600
01:22:36,815 --> 01:22:39,682
I had no idea.

601
01:22:43,121 --> 01:22:45,521
Sorry!

602
01:22:48,527 --> 01:22:51,519
Is it painful?

603
01:22:53,432 --> 01:22:56,993
It must be painful.

604
01:22:57,202 --> 01:23:00,535
- What's wrong?
- Your eye.

605
01:23:03,809 --> 01:23:05,970
What about it?

606
01:23:06,178 --> 01:23:10,979
There's something black
in the green part of your eye.

607
01:23:11,183 --> 01:23:16,951
Oh, that.
It's a flaw in the iris.

608
01:23:18,490 --> 01:23:23,621
- A flaw?
- Yes, it's a sort of birthmark.

609
01:23:59,531 --> 01:24:04,332
- Did you wear a uniform?
- Sometimes.

610
01:24:06,705 --> 01:24:10,505
You must have looked cute in blue.

611
01:24:10,709 --> 01:24:13,576
Give me a break, will you?

612
01:24:13,778 --> 01:24:18,613
I want to know more about you.

613
01:24:18,817 --> 01:24:21,377
Not now.

614
01:24:23,088 --> 01:24:27,718
You really don't like to talk about
the past, do you?

615
01:24:28,827 --> 01:24:31,295
I'm tired.

616
01:24:31,496 --> 01:24:36,763
- Why does it bother you to talk of it?
- It bothers everybody who works there.

617
01:24:36,968 --> 01:24:40,734
- Where?
- Chinatown. Everybody.

618
01:24:42,407 --> 01:24:47,538
- To me it was just bad luck.
- Why?

619
01:24:48,980 --> 01:24:53,679
You can't always tell what's going on.

620
01:24:53,885 --> 01:24:57,286
Like with you.

621
01:25:05,063 --> 01:25:10,467
Why was...
Why was it bad luck?

622
01:25:15,340 --> 01:25:19,140
I was trying to keep someone
from being hurt.

623
01:25:19,344 --> 01:25:24,145
I ended up
making sure that she was hurt.

624
01:25:24,349 --> 01:25:28,513
Cherchez la femme.

625
01:25:30,222 --> 01:25:33,487
Was there a woman involved?

626
01:25:34,726 --> 01:25:37,160
Of course.

627
01:25:37,362 --> 01:25:39,592
Dead?

628
01:25:52,277 --> 01:25:55,110
Yes, hello?

629
01:25:56,481 --> 01:26:00,110
Oh, my God!
Don't do anything.

630
01:26:00,318 --> 01:26:03,947
Don't do anything until I get there.

631
01:26:07,025 --> 01:26:10,426
I have to go.

632
01:26:10,629 --> 01:26:14,497
- Where?
- It's just that I have to.

633
01:26:14,699 --> 01:26:18,396
- I want to know where you're going.
- Don't be angry.

634
01:26:18,603 --> 01:26:21,436
It has nothing to do with you
or any of this.

635
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:25,599
- Where are you going?
- Please...

636
01:26:26,611 --> 01:26:29,978
Trust me this much.

637
01:26:39,391 --> 01:26:41,985
I'll be back.

638
01:26:46,398 --> 01:26:52,303
There is something
that I should tell you -

639
01:26:52,504 --> 01:26:58,636
- about the fishing club
that old lady mentioned.

640
01:26:58,843 --> 01:27:03,212
- The Albacore Club.
- It has to do with my father.

641
01:27:03,415 --> 01:27:07,647
- I know.
- He owns it... You know?

642
01:27:07,852 --> 01:27:10,446
I saw him.

643
01:27:12,657 --> 01:27:16,593
You saw... my father?

644
01:27:20,498 --> 01:27:23,763
- When?
- This morning.

645
01:27:26,071 --> 01:27:31,008
- You didn't tell me.
- Well, there hasn't been much time.

646
01:27:31,209 --> 01:27:35,043
What did he say?

647
01:27:40,118 --> 01:27:44,248
- What did he say?
- That you were jealous.

648
01:27:45,757 --> 01:27:50,057
- That he was afraid what you might do.
- To whom?

649
01:27:50,261 --> 01:27:54,220
Mulwray's girlfriend, for one.

650
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:59,893
He wanted to know where she was.

651
01:28:01,639 --> 01:28:07,874
I want you to listen to me.
My father is a very dangerous man.

652
01:28:08,079 --> 01:28:12,209
You don't know how dangerous.
You don't know how crazy.

653
01:28:12,417 --> 01:28:16,751
Are you trying to tell me
that he might be behind all of this?

654
01:28:16,955 --> 01:28:19,583
It's possible.

655
01:28:24,662 --> 01:28:28,996
- Even the death of your husband?
- It's possible.

656
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:34,001
Now please, don't ask me any more
questions. Just wait for me here.

657
01:28:34,205 --> 01:28:37,333
I need you here.

658
01:32:16,494 --> 01:32:21,227
- Give me the keys.
- You...!

659
01:32:21,432 --> 01:32:27,200
It's either that
or you drive yourself to the police.

660
01:32:27,405 --> 01:32:32,365
Come on, Mrs Mulwray. You have your
husband's girlfriend tied up in there.

661
01:32:32,577 --> 01:32:36,172
- She's not tied up.
- You're holding her against her will.

662
01:32:36,381 --> 01:32:38,781
I am not.

663
01:32:38,983 --> 01:32:42,942
- Okay, then let's go talk to her.
- No!

664
01:32:43,154 --> 01:32:46,783
She's too upset.

665
01:32:48,459 --> 01:32:52,896
- What about?
- Hollis's death.

666
01:32:53,097 --> 01:32:59,036
I tried to keep it from her until
I could make plans for us to leave.

667
01:32:59,237 --> 01:33:02,832
She just found out about it?

668
01:33:04,042 --> 01:33:09,446
- That's not what it looks like.
- What does it look like?

669
01:33:09,647 --> 01:33:14,084
Like she knows more
than you want her to tell.

670
01:33:14,285 --> 01:33:18,813
- You're insane.
- Tell me the truth. I'm not the police.

671
01:33:19,023 --> 01:33:23,551
I don't care what you've done.
I don't want to hurt you.

672
01:33:26,164 --> 01:33:31,397
- You won't go to the police if I tell you?
- I will if you don't.

673
01:33:50,588 --> 01:33:53,785
She's my sister.

674
01:33:58,730 --> 01:34:00,960
Take it easy.

675
01:34:01,165 --> 01:34:04,293
If she's your sister, she's your sister.

676
01:34:04,502 --> 01:34:09,269
- Why all the secrecy?
- I can't...

677
01:34:09,474 --> 01:34:14,502
Is it because she was
seeing your husband? Is that it?

678
01:34:18,082 --> 01:34:21,643
I'd never have harmed Hollis.

679
01:34:21,853 --> 01:34:25,846
He was the most gentle,
decent man imaginable.

680
01:34:28,059 --> 01:34:33,520
And he put up with more from me
than you'll ever know.

681
01:34:36,033 --> 01:34:39,662
I wanted him to be happy.

682
01:34:56,888 --> 01:35:01,416
I borrowed you husband's car.
I'll bring it back in the morning.

683
01:35:01,626 --> 01:35:06,928
- Aren't you coming back with me?
- Don't worry, I won't tell anybody.

684
01:35:08,699 --> 01:35:11,190
That's not what I meant.

685
01:35:14,372 --> 01:35:17,705
Yeah, well...

686
01:35:17,909 --> 01:35:21,936
I'm tired, Mrs Mulwray. Good night.

687
01:36:28,012 --> 01:36:31,140
Gittes? Gittes?

688
01:36:31,349 --> 01:36:35,080
- Yeah?
- Ida Sessions wants to see you.

689
01:36:35,286 --> 01:36:39,655
- Who?
- Ida Sessions. You remember Ida.

690
01:36:39,857 --> 01:36:43,520
- Yeah, I do...?
- Sure you do.

691
01:36:46,063 --> 01:36:48,930
I'll tell you what, pal...

692
01:36:49,133 --> 01:36:54,264
If Ida wants to see me,
she can call me at my office.

693
01:37:20,431 --> 01:37:24,697
8481/2 East Kensington, Echo Park.

694
01:37:24,902 --> 01:37:28,668
She begged me to call.
She's waiting for you.

695
01:40:35,459 --> 01:40:39,190
Find anything interesting, Gittes?

696
01:40:42,466 --> 01:40:47,426
- What are you doing around here?
- Didn't you call me?

697
01:40:48,239 --> 01:40:53,074
- How come you happen to know her?
- I don't.

698
01:40:55,146 --> 01:40:58,206
I want to show you something.

699
01:41:07,291 --> 01:41:12,422
- Isn't that your phone number?
- I forget, I don't call myself that often.

700
01:41:12,630 --> 01:41:15,599
Just to make sure,
we had Loach give you a call.

701
01:41:15,799 --> 01:41:21,135
What happened to your nose?
Get a bedroom window slammed on it?

702
01:41:22,139 --> 01:41:27,509
Nope. Your wife got excited,
she crossed her legs a little too quick.

703
01:41:50,668 --> 01:41:55,071
- They look familiar?
- Yeah, I took them. So what?

704
01:41:55,272 --> 01:42:00,403
- How did she happen to have them?
- Either you tell me or I guess.

705
01:42:00,611 --> 01:42:07,710
- Do you really think I'm stupid?
- Let me think on it. I'll get back to you.

706
01:42:07,918 --> 01:42:12,480
- Now I'd like to go home.
- I want the other pictures.

707
01:42:13,791 --> 01:42:17,921
This broad hired you,
not Evelyn Mulwray.

708
01:42:18,128 --> 01:42:21,495
Somebody
wanted to shake Mulwray down.

709
01:42:21,699 --> 01:42:25,658
She hired you. That's how
you found out he was murdered.

710
01:42:25,869 --> 01:42:31,808
- I heard it was an accident.
- You think we're a bunch of assholes?

711
01:42:32,009 --> 01:42:34,978
Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.

712
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:42,050
You tailed him day and night. You saw
who killed him. You even took pictures.

713
01:42:42,253 --> 01:42:46,519
It was Evelyn Mulwray.
She's been paying you off ever since.

714
01:42:46,724 --> 01:42:53,323
You accuse me of extortion? You're
dumber than you think I think you are.

715
01:42:53,530 --> 01:42:57,967
I wouldn't extort a nickel
from my worst enemy.

716
01:42:58,168 --> 01:43:03,800
I want the pictures. Accessory after
the fact, conspiracy and extortion.

717
01:43:04,008 --> 01:43:06,977
You think Evelyn killed her husband
in the ocean, -

718
01:43:07,177 --> 01:43:12,308
- then dragged him up to a reservoir
to make it look more like an accident?

719
01:43:12,516 --> 01:43:17,977
He was moved because somebody
didn't want his body found in the ocean.

720
01:43:18,188 --> 01:43:23,125
He found out they were dumping water
and trying to cover it up.

721
01:43:24,762 --> 01:43:29,563
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Come on, I'll show you.

722
01:43:29,767 --> 01:43:34,466
Come on, Lou, you're in charge.
Make a decision.

723
01:43:51,221 --> 01:43:56,750
It's too late.
They only dump the water at night.

724
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:00,191
- Reach anybody?
- Yelburton. He's the new chief.

725
01:44:00,397 --> 01:44:03,423
- I know. Go on.
- He says...

726
01:44:03,634 --> 01:44:08,037
- I know what he says.
- Shut up! Go on.

727
01:44:08,238 --> 01:44:12,572
He says there's irrigation in the Valley,
and there's always a little run-off.

728
01:44:12,776 --> 01:44:18,373
He says Gittes knows this, and that
he's made irresponsible accusations.

729
01:44:18,582 --> 01:44:22,518
Let's get a warrant for her arrest.
What are we waiting for?

730
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:28,215
He just made lieutenant. He wants
to hang on to his little gold bar.

731
01:44:30,894 --> 01:44:35,661
Have her in my office in two hours.
Remember, I don't have to let you go.

732
01:44:35,866 --> 01:44:41,099
I've got you right now
for withholding evidence.

733
01:45:27,484 --> 01:45:32,547
Where's Mrs Mulwray?
Are these her bags?

734
01:45:35,058 --> 01:45:38,118
Is she going on a trip?

735
01:45:38,328 --> 01:45:42,162
What going on here?
Is she going on a vacation?

736
01:45:42,366 --> 01:45:48,236
- Mrs Mulwray no home.
- Well, I'll just have a look around.

737
01:45:55,746 --> 01:45:59,773
- Yeah, bad for the glass.
- Yes, bad for glass.

738
01:45:59,983 --> 01:46:04,181
Salt water very bad for glass.

739
01:46:18,535 --> 01:46:20,503
Salt water?

740
01:46:20,704 --> 01:46:24,265
Very, very bad. See?

741
01:46:32,516 --> 01:46:35,644
What's that?

742
01:46:35,853 --> 01:46:37,946
Right there.

743
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:43,424
There.

744
01:47:39,917 --> 01:47:44,081
- You wait.
- You wait.

745
01:47:47,591 --> 01:47:50,560
How are you? I've been calling you.

746
01:47:50,761 --> 01:47:54,219
- Have you slept?
- Sure.

747
01:47:54,431 --> 01:47:57,025
Have you had lunch?

748
01:47:57,234 --> 01:48:00,397
- Where's the girl?
- Upstairs. Why?

749
01:48:00,604 --> 01:48:04,563
- I want to see her.
- She's having a bath right now.

750
01:48:04,775 --> 01:48:09,041
- Why do you want to see her?
- Going someplace?

751
01:48:09,246 --> 01:48:12,215
Yes, we have a 5:30 train to catch.

752
01:48:15,452 --> 01:48:17,545
Jake...

753
01:48:26,430 --> 01:48:30,059
J.J. Gittes for Lt. Escobar.

754
01:48:30,267 --> 01:48:35,728
- What's wrong? I said we have a 5:30...
- You're gonna miss your train.

755
01:48:38,041 --> 01:48:42,808
Lou, meet me at 1972 Canyon Drive.

756
01:48:43,780 --> 01:48:46,874
Yeah, as soon as you can.

757
01:48:47,084 --> 01:48:51,350
- Why did you do that?
- You know any criminal lawyers?

758
01:48:51,555 --> 01:48:56,390
- No.
- No worry, I can recommend a couple.

759
01:48:57,594 --> 01:49:00,961
They're expensive,
but you can afford it.

760
01:49:01,164 --> 01:49:05,965
Will you please tell me
what this is all about?

761
01:49:16,246 --> 01:49:20,307
I found these in your backyard,
in the pond.

762
01:49:20,517 --> 01:49:24,681
They belonged to your husband,
didn't they?

763
01:49:24,888 --> 01:49:31,259
- I don't know. Yes, probably.
- Positively. He was drowned there.

764
01:49:31,461 --> 01:49:34,828
- What?
- There's no time to be shocked.

765
01:49:35,032 --> 01:49:39,264
The coroner proved he had salt water
in his lungs when he was killed.

766
01:49:39,469 --> 01:49:42,802
I want to know how it happened,
and why, -

767
01:49:43,006 --> 01:49:46,703
- before Escobar gets here.
I don't want to lose my license.

768
01:49:46,910 --> 01:49:51,176
I don't know what you are talking about.
This is the craziest...

769
01:49:51,381 --> 01:49:56,045
Stop it! I want to make it easy for you.
You were jealous, you had a fight.

770
01:49:56,253 --> 01:49:59,882
He hit his head. It was an accident.
But his girl is a witness.

771
01:50:00,090 --> 01:50:04,424
So you had to shut her up,
and you had the money to do it.

772
01:50:04,628 --> 01:50:06,789
- Yes or no?
- No!

773
01:50:06,997 --> 01:50:11,058
Who is she? She's not your sister,
you don't have one.

774
01:50:11,268 --> 01:50:15,500
I'll tell you the truth.

775
01:50:18,008 --> 01:50:21,341
Good. What's her name?

776
01:50:21,545 --> 01:50:24,708
- Katherine.
- Katherine who?

777
01:50:27,050 --> 01:50:29,541
She's my daughter.

778
01:50:29,753 --> 01:50:34,781
- I said I want the truth!
- She's my sister.

779
01:50:34,991 --> 01:50:39,826
She's my daughter.
My sister, my daughter.

780
01:50:41,198 --> 01:50:44,463
I said I want the truth!

781
01:50:46,703 --> 01:50:50,400
She's my sister and my daughter!

782
01:50:53,543 --> 01:50:58,480
Khan, please, go back.
For God's sake, keep her upstairs.

783
01:51:05,889 --> 01:51:09,381
My father and I...

784
01:51:12,229 --> 01:51:16,097
Understand?
Or is it too tough for you?

785
01:51:25,876 --> 01:51:28,504
He raped you?

786
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:48,056
- Then what happened?
- I ran away.

787
01:51:48,265 --> 01:51:50,460
To Mexico?

788
01:51:55,639 --> 01:51:59,370
Hollis came and took care of me.

789
01:52:02,012 --> 01:52:07,109
I couldn't see her. I was 15.

790
01:52:09,653 --> 01:52:14,147
I wanted to but I...
I couldn't.

791
01:52:17,394 --> 01:52:19,453
Then...

792
01:52:21,331 --> 01:52:26,030
Now I want to be with her.
I want to take care of her.

793
01:52:26,236 --> 01:52:31,674
- Where are you gonna take her now?
- Back to Mexico.

794
01:52:31,875 --> 01:52:37,609
You can't take the train. Escobar
will be looking for you everywhere.

795
01:52:42,018 --> 01:52:45,181
- How about a plane?
- That's worse.

796
01:52:45,388 --> 01:52:51,054
You betterjust go. Leave all this
stuff here. Where does Khan live?

797
01:52:51,261 --> 01:52:55,459
- Get the exact address.
- All right.

798
01:52:58,568 --> 01:53:02,402
Those didn't belong to Hollis.

799
01:53:02,606 --> 01:53:07,066
- How do you know?
- He didn't wear bifocals.

800
01:53:37,941 --> 01:53:43,208
- Katherine, say hello to Mr Gittes.
- Hello.

801
01:53:43,413 --> 01:53:45,381
Hello.

802
01:53:50,253 --> 01:53:55,919
He lives at 1712 Alameda.
Do you know where that is?

803
01:53:56,126 --> 01:53:58,321
Sure.

804
01:54:20,850 --> 01:54:24,786
Sophie, get me Walsh.

805
01:54:24,988 --> 01:54:30,221
Listen pal, Escobar's gonna try
and book me in about five minutes.

806
01:54:30,427 --> 01:54:33,954
- What's the matter?
- Relax and I'll tell you.

807
01:54:34,164 --> 01:54:40,433
If you don't hear from me in two hours,
you and Duffy come to 1712 Alameda.

808
01:54:41,538 --> 01:54:48,068
- Jesus, that's in Chinatown, aint it?
- I know where it is. Just do it.

809
01:55:17,407 --> 01:55:20,433
Come on in, Lou.

810
01:55:20,643 --> 01:55:25,171
Looks like we're both too late.
She flew the coop.

811
01:55:29,552 --> 01:55:32,885
And you've no idea where she went?

812
01:55:33,089 --> 01:55:38,652
As a matter of fact I do. Her maid's
house. She knows something's up.

813
01:55:38,795 --> 01:55:41,662
What's the maid's address?

814
01:55:41,865 --> 01:55:46,928
- She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down...
- No, Gittes, you're gonna show us.

815
01:55:47,137 --> 01:55:49,264
What for?

816
01:55:49,472 --> 01:55:55,274
Because if she ain't there, you're gonna
stay downtown until she does show up.

817
01:55:55,478 --> 01:55:58,879
Gee Lou, I'm doing the best I can.

818
01:55:59,082 --> 01:56:03,451
Tell us about it
on the way to San Pedro.

819
01:56:15,799 --> 01:56:19,758
- Let's get the little lady.
- Can I ask you a favour?

820
01:56:19,969 --> 01:56:22,767
I'd like to bring her out myself.

821
01:56:22,972 --> 01:56:26,237
She's not armed,
she won't be a problem.

822
01:56:26,443 --> 01:56:32,313
I just want a minute alone with her.
It would mean a lot to her, and to me.

823
01:56:36,219 --> 01:56:40,019
You never learn, do you, Jake?

824
01:56:40,223 --> 01:56:43,090
I guess not.

825
01:56:44,727 --> 01:56:47,287
Okay...

826
01:56:47,497 --> 01:56:51,695
I'll give you three minutes.
Just three minutes.

827
01:56:51,901 --> 01:56:54,563
Gee, thanks, Lou.

828
01:57:11,855 --> 01:57:14,085
Hello.

829
01:57:14,290 --> 01:57:17,817
Mr Gittes, come in!
This is some surprise.

830
01:57:18,027 --> 01:57:21,793
- Call me Jake. How you doing, Curly?
- Care to join us?

831
01:57:21,998 --> 01:57:26,492
- No, thanks.
- A glass of wine? This is the fella...

832
01:57:26,703 --> 01:57:29,934
- I know.
- No, thank you.

833
01:57:30,140 --> 01:57:35,100
But I'd like a glass of water.
Come out in the kitchen with me.

834
01:57:38,781 --> 01:57:42,649
- Curly, where's your car?
- In the garage off the alley.

835
01:57:42,852 --> 01:57:47,949
Can you give me a ride somewhere...?
Right now. It can't wait.

836
01:57:48,158 --> 01:57:51,992
- I'll tell my wife.
- Tell her later, Curl.

837
01:58:23,560 --> 01:58:26,529
Just drive slow for a block or two.

838
01:58:26,729 --> 01:58:31,359
- What's this all about?
- I'll tell you in a block or two.

839
01:58:32,368 --> 01:58:37,032
- How much do you owe me?
- Gee, we're going out tomorrow.

840
01:58:37,240 --> 01:58:40,767
You've been good about it,
but my cousin's sick.

841
01:58:40,977 --> 01:58:46,074
How would you like to pay me off by
taking two passengers to Encenada?

842
01:58:46,282 --> 01:58:49,911
- You'd have to leave tonight.
- I don't know.

843
01:58:50,119 --> 01:58:54,749
I might be able to squeeze
75 bucks out of it for you.

844
01:58:54,958 --> 01:58:58,052
Maybe even 100.

845
01:58:58,261 --> 01:59:02,027
- Plus what I owe?
- I'll throw that in too.

846
01:59:02,232 --> 01:59:08,432
1712 Alameda. Wait for me until 8:30.
If I don't show, take them to your boat.

847
01:59:21,684 --> 01:59:24,653
You're sure this is okay?

848
01:59:24,854 --> 01:59:28,813
Do you know how long
I've been in this business?

849
01:59:55,818 --> 02:00:00,881
Have you got your checkbook handy,
Mr Cross? I've got the girl.

850
02:00:01,090 --> 02:00:05,026
- You've got her? Where?
- Remember the figures we discussed?

851
02:00:05,228 --> 02:00:08,561
- Yes. Where are you?
- Your daughter's house.

852
02:00:08,765 --> 02:00:12,326
- How soon can you get here?
- An hour.

853
02:00:36,092 --> 02:00:42,258
There you are! Well, you don't look
too much the worse for wear.

854
02:00:42,465 --> 02:00:48,062
- Where's the girl? Is she all right?
- She's fine.

855
02:00:48,271 --> 02:00:52,674
- Well, where is she?
- With her mother.

856
02:00:54,243 --> 02:00:58,646
- I've got something I'd like to show you.
- What is it?

857
02:00:58,848 --> 02:01:02,614
An obituary column.
Can you see all right in this light?

858
02:01:02,819 --> 02:01:05,413
I guess I can manage.

859
02:01:13,963 --> 02:01:18,832
- What does it mean?
- That you killed Hollis Mulwray.

860
02:01:19,035 --> 02:01:22,801
Right here. In that pond.

861
02:01:23,005 --> 02:01:27,271
You drowned him,
and you left these.

862
02:01:29,746 --> 02:01:35,207
The coroner's report shows Mulwray
had salt water in his lungs.

863
02:01:37,453 --> 02:01:42,254
Hollis was always fascinated
by tide pools.

864
02:01:42,458 --> 02:01:46,588
- You know what he used to say?
- I haven't the faintest idea.

865
02:01:46,796 --> 02:01:50,789
'That's where life begins, tide pools!"

866
02:01:52,235 --> 02:01:56,194
He figured that if you
dumped water into the desert sand -

867
02:01:56,406 --> 02:01:59,569
- and let it percolate
down to the bedrock, -

868
02:01:59,776 --> 02:02:05,476
- it wouldn't evaporate the way it does
in reservoirs. You lose 20%, not 80%.

869
02:02:05,681 --> 02:02:09,014
- He made this city!
- You were gonna do that in the Valley?

870
02:02:09,218 --> 02:02:12,676
I am doing it. When the bond issue
passes Tuesday -

871
02:02:12,889 --> 02:02:16,325
- there will be eight million dollars
to build a reservoir.

872
02:02:16,526 --> 02:02:21,486
People will be mad when they find out
they're paying for water they won't get.

873
02:02:21,697 --> 02:02:24,791
That's all taken care of. You see, -

874
02:02:25,001 --> 02:02:30,166
- either you bring the water to L.A.
Or you bring L.A. To the water.

875
02:02:30,373 --> 02:02:35,970
- How are you gonna do that?
- I'll incorporate the Valley into the city.

876
02:02:37,180 --> 02:02:41,048
- How much are you worth?
- How much do you want?

877
02:02:41,250 --> 02:02:44,879
- Are you worth over ten million?
- Oh, yes.

878
02:02:45,087 --> 02:02:50,286
Why are you doing it? What can
you buy that you can't already afford?

879
02:02:50,493 --> 02:02:54,691
The future, Mr Gittes. The future.

880
02:02:54,897 --> 02:02:58,856
Now where's the girl?
I want the only daughter I've got left.

881
02:02:59,068 --> 02:03:02,469
As you now,
Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.

882
02:03:02,672 --> 02:03:08,406
- Who do you blame for that? Her?
- I don't blame myself.

883
02:03:08,611 --> 02:03:12,274
Most people
never have to face the fact -

884
02:03:12,482 --> 02:03:18,443
- that at the right time and the right
place, they're capable of anything.

885
02:03:18,654 --> 02:03:22,988
Claude, take those glasses from him.

886
02:03:29,532 --> 02:03:32,990
Not worth it, Mr Gittes.

887
02:03:33,202 --> 02:03:36,296
It's really not worth it.

888
02:03:41,644 --> 02:03:42,440
Take us to the girl.

889
02:04:38,601 --> 02:04:44,301
You remember Night Train Claude
Mulvihill? These are my associates...

890
02:04:46,409 --> 02:04:51,938
- You're under arrest, Jake.
- Good news.

891
02:04:52,148 --> 02:04:55,845
Withholding evidence, extortion,
accessory after the fact.

892
02:04:56,052 --> 02:05:01,046
I didn't extort nothing from nobody.
This is Noah Cross. Evelyn's father.

893
02:05:01,257 --> 02:05:07,924
He's the bird you're after. I can explain
everything in five minutes. He's rich!

894
02:05:08,130 --> 02:05:13,227
- He thinks he can get away with it.
- You shut up, or I'll lock you up.

895
02:05:13,436 --> 02:05:18,738
I am rich, I am Noah Cross.
Evelyn Mulwray is my daughter.

896
02:05:18,941 --> 02:05:24,277
He's crazy, Lou! He killed Mulwray
because of the water thing. Just listen!

897
02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:30,646
- Lock him to the wheel of the car.
- You don't know what's going on here.

898
02:05:30,853 --> 02:05:33,617
Katherine!

899
02:05:33,823 --> 02:05:39,853
I am your grandfather, my dear.
I am your grandfather.

900
02:05:42,531 --> 02:05:46,058
No, go on.
I'll follow you.

901
02:05:47,570 --> 02:05:53,805
- Get away from her. Get away!
- Evelyn, please... be reasonable.

902
02:05:54,010 --> 02:05:58,310
- Come to my...
- Get away from her!

903
02:05:59,949 --> 02:06:04,682
How many years have I got?
She's mine, too.

904
02:06:04,887 --> 02:06:09,324
She's never going to know that.

905
02:06:09,525 --> 02:06:13,154
You're a disturbed woman.
You cannot provide...

906
02:06:13,362 --> 02:06:19,028
- Evelyn, let the police handle this.
- He owns the police!

907
02:06:19,235 --> 02:06:23,262
- Get away from her.
- You'll have to kill me first.

908
02:06:25,074 --> 02:06:28,168
Close the door.

909
02:06:28,377 --> 02:06:30,504
Halt!

910
02:07:11,787 --> 02:07:16,815
Get the captain. Get an ambulance.
Turn them all loose.

911
02:07:21,630 --> 02:07:25,157
Lord... Oh, Lord!

912
02:07:45,888 --> 02:07:49,949
- As little as possible.
- What's that?

913
02:07:51,794 --> 02:07:54,058
What's that?

914
02:07:57,967 --> 02:08:02,028
You wanna do your partner
a big favour?

915
02:08:02,238 --> 02:08:05,036
Take him home.

916
02:08:07,643 --> 02:08:12,603
Take him home.
Just get him the hell out of here!

917
02:08:14,583 --> 02:08:18,542
Go home, Jake.
I'm doing you a favour.

918
02:08:20,523 --> 02:08:23,117
Come on, Jake.

919
02:08:25,427 --> 02:08:29,158
Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.

920
02:08:42,711 --> 02:08:46,772
All right, clear the area!
On the sidewalk.

921
02:08:48,551 --> 02:08:51,577
On the sidewalk!

922
02:08:51,787 --> 02:08:54,915
Get off the street!

923
02:08:56,559 --> 02:08:59,528
Get off the street!
