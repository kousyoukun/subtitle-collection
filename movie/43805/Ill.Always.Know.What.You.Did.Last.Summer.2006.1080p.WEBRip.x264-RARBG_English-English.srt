1
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:41,061
AMBER: So you've all
heard the story, right?

2
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:45,966
About what happens on July 4?

3
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:48,502
Whoa, Amber,
you want to
freak everyone out?

4
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:50,338
No.

5
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:53,040
I just like
hearing you tell it.

6
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,875
What are you
guys talking about?

7
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,179
The Fisherman.

8
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:06,854
Every 4th of July,

9
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,657
he gets out
his hat and slicker,

10
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:11,625
he sharpens up his hook,

11
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:14,262
and runs wild.

12
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:18,432
But only after teenagers.

13
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:22,202
That's right,
the ones with
dirty little secrets.

14
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,339
What about you, Zoe?
I bet you got some
dirty little secrets.

15
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:27,174
Yeah.
I heard you suck in bed.

16
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:28,242
Ugh!

17
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,511
Nice.

18
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,715
July 4.

19
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:39,987
*(FESTIVE MUSIC PLAYING)

20
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,159
Hey!

21
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,296
Seriously,
a guy on my ski team knows

22
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:50,498
this girl who went
camping last summer,

23
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,199
and they saw the Fisherman.

24
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:55,336
Two days later,
two kids didn't make it
out of the woods.

25
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:57,137
So he's kind of like
Santa Claus, huh?

26
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:58,306
Only in reverse.

27
00:03:58,372 --> 00:03:59,973
He goes after
the kids that are naughty?

28
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,642
No, he's more
like Jack the Ripper,

29
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,277
except the guy
never got caught.

30
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:05,446
LANCE: Well, I wouldn't worry.

31
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:09,517
Dude,
it's Broken Ridge, Colorado,
in the summer.

32
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,886
Even a psycho killer knows
to avoid this place.

33
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:14,655
Yeah,
the guy would probably die

34
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:16,857
of boredom
before he got any of us.

35
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:23,697
Hey, I heard you're
running some sort of
field trip in September.

36
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,799
It's a photo shoot, really.

37
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,668
Why, are you interested?

38
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:29,803
Well,
I figured since stud boy's
gonna be gone to college,

39
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,839
maybe you need somebody
to carry your tripod.

40
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:34,708
Very funny. Are--are you
working, or are you just
hitting on my girlfriend?

41
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,377
Depends. You want to play?

42
00:04:36,444 --> 00:04:39,112
Whoa, what, with your balls?
No, thanks.

43
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,114
Come on, baby.

44
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:44,084
Win me a monkey.

45
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,619
Okay.

46
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:48,322
But if I win,
you crash at my place tonight.

47
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:50,691
Tell your mom
you're staying at Zoe's.

48
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,762
Is that a yes or a no?

49
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,364
First win the monkey.

50
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,565
All right.

51
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:06,407
Oh, yeah!

52
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:10,010
I'll take that.

53
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:16,116
Happy 4th of July, babe.

54
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,451
I'm gonna miss you.

55
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:19,019
I know.

56
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:20,621
You're the lucky one.

57
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:24,057
You get to take off
and I have to stay
here another year.

58
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:26,360
It's weird, me in L.A.

59
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:29,397
What do you mean?
It's brilliant!

60
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:31,231
And when I get there,

61
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:33,534
it's going to be
the most amazing place
in the world

62
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:35,002
for the two of us.

63
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:41,241
Ugh, yuck.

64
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,549

66
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:52,720
Oh, my gosh, P.J.,
I can't believe
you actually did it.

67
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:55,188
Well, just ROTC.

68
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:58,392
Uh, you could say my daddy
worked me over.

69
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,196
P.J.: But, uh,
guess who's next, little cuz?

70
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,898
Yeah, that's right,
I give it another year

71
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,500
and he's coming
after your ass.

72
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:07,835
I don't think so.

73
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,637
Come on, it's in our blood.

74
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,039
And plus,

75
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,675
Uh-huh. Okay, true. True.

You should've double checked
the mattresses, Roger.

Somebody moved them.

go to college.

Look, everyone
at that carnival

158
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:48,842
thinks that some psycho
in a raincoat did it, right?

think anything different?

and what'll happen?

P.J.'s dad will
try to nail us.

162
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,384
He never liked
us to begin with,

163
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:01,221
and in this small-ass town,
innocent or guilty,
we're dead.

164
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:03,857
So we tell him
that we're not doing this.

165

because we only get
one chance at this.

lives just like P.J.

and everybody else.

170
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:25,445
Okay, but the only way
we pull this off

171
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:28,415
is if we stick together
and we keep it a secret.

172
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,617
It dies with us.

173
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:33,253
You really think
it's that easy?

174
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,256
Amber, telling the truth
isn't gonna bring P.J. back.

we got the idea
for that damn prank.

What is this?

699

all this together.

We thought it was
a big hoax,
but it turns out

701
01:03:46,957 --> 01:03:48,525
to be based
on a real guy.

702
01:03:50,861 --> 01:03:52,963
On the 4th of July,
this guy goes crazy.

703
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:55,699
He kills a bunch of kids
in this little fishing town.

704
01:03:55,765 --> 01:03:58,002
Supposedly it was
some kind of revenge.

705
01:03:58,802 --> 01:04:00,537
Then a year later,

706
01:04:00,604 --> 01:04:03,507
he goes after them again,

707
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:06,911
on some island
in the Caribbean
and dies there.

708

Yeah.

709
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,951
