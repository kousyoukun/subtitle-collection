My mother didn't know
she was Jewish
until she was thirteen.

It was 1938.

612
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,200

that they were Jewish.

This is the high school
where they first met.

623

This is the war
they both went to.

And this man was popular
when they met again.

625
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:24,500
This is the only place
my father could hide
and have sex in the '50s.

626
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,900
My father said
if you got caught
by the vice squad,

627
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,400
you could lose everything.

This is everything.

629
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,400
My father laid down
on a couch like this

630
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,500
and told the psychiatrist
all his problems in 1955.

631
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:41,700
The doctor told him
that homosexuality
was a mental illness,

632
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,400
but it could be cured.

633
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,100
Not everyone got cured.

634
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,500
This is where
my parents lived in 1955.

group were secretly meeting.

01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:46,500
No.

1129
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:52,300
This is my kitchen.
It's where I eat.

1130
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:55,900
This is my bathroom.

1131
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,600
It's very fancy.

1132
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:03,900
Outside my window
is my neighbor's roof.

1133
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:09,700
The room at the end
is my bedroom.

1134
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:13,800
That's my closet.

1135
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:17,800
Those are my clothes.

1136
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,300
My pictures.

1137
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,900
Why do you leave everyone?

1138
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:32,500
Why did you let me go?

1139
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:43,500
OLlVER: Maybe because
I don't really believe
that it's gonna work.

1140
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:47,300
And then I make sure
that it doesn't work.

1141
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:54,400
lsn't Juan's hair
wonderful?

1142
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,100
Thanks.

1143
01:30:57,100 --> 01:30:59,000
l use this
great mousse.

1144
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,800
Well, it's terrific.

1145
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:03,400
Do you wanna
try something?

1146
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:05,300
Just a little bit?

1147
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:06,300
l don't think so.

1148
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:09,800
Come on. Just try
a little bit.
lt'll be fun.

1149
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:11,600
Yeah?
Yeah.

1150
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:13,800
How do you do it?

1151
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:16,000
Okay. l'm gonna
show you how.

1152
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:43,300
There.
ls that it?

1153
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:45,000
How do l look?

1154
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,300
Great.

1155
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:53,900
You look great.

1156
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:31,700
Oliver.

1157
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:34,400
He's gone.

(SOBBlNG)

1159
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:05,300
OLlVER:
Once you make the call,

1160
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:07,200
you have less than
an hour before two men

1161
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:09,500
come and place
the body into a bag.

1162
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:14,300
They charge $1,485
for a cremation

1163
01:33:14,300 --> 01:33:16,700
and deliver the remains
in a small, metal container

1164
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:19,100
the size of a jar
of peanut butter.

1165
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,700
You will need to get
a death certificate.

1166
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:25,400
You will need to make
copies and send them to
cancel every credit card,

1167
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:30,500
phone account,
utility, gym membership,
every insurance policy,

1168
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:33,000
mortgage,
to settle their taxes.

1169
01:33:33,700 --> 01:33:36,500
You will have all their mail
forwarded to your address.

1170
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:39,500
You will write
their obituary.

1171
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:42,900
You run it with a photo
in the paper for $2 a word.

1172
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:44,800
You'll wonder if it's right.

1173
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:47,600
You'll throw a lot
of their stuff away.

1174
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:50,600
You'll bring a lot of
their stuff to your house.

1175
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:54,200
This is the photo
my mother kept
in her bedroom.

1176
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:57,600
When I was a kid,
I thought that was
my arm giving her daisies.

1177
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:02,500
Now I make a new mistake
and I think it's her arm
giving me the daisies, saying,

1178
01:34:02,700 --> 01:34:06,000
''Here. Here is
simple and happy.

1179
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,100
''That's what
I meant to give you. ''

Thank you.

Thanks.

Sure.

1186

Come on.

1187
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:40,300
lt's because l'm gay.

1188

lsn't it?

1189
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:44,700
What?

1190
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:48,000
You never called
or came to see me.

1191
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,000
No.

1192
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:58,000
No, it's because my father
loved you so much.

1193
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:26,800
Arthur.

1194
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,100
Hey.

01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:35,100
Hey, how have you been?
How have you been?

Hey.
Hi.

Come in, come in.

1199
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:58,300
The living room.

1200
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:00,700

01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:12,900
Crazy picture.

Yeah.

1204
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:17,100
Can l read it?

''l'm looking for sex
