1
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,400
Okay. Is it on?

2
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,200
Yeah, yeah.

3
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,500
Okay. Okay.

4
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,900
This is for our friend, Hal Fields.

5
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,100
Hal, we love you.

6
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,000
Arthur, you're coming to live with me now, okay?

7
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,700
This is my car.

8
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,800
This is the dining room where people come and eat sometimes.

9
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,600
This is the living room.

10
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,600
That's the bathroom.

11
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,300
This is 2003.

12
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,500
This is what the sun looks like,

13
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,900
and the stars, nature...

14
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,200
This is the President.

15
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,200
And this is the sun in 1955.

16
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,100
And the stars,

17
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,200
and nature,

18
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,700
and cars and phones and movies and the President.

19
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,900
These are what pets looked like.

20
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,600
These are fireworks.

21
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,100
This was smoking.

22
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,400
This is what it looked like when people kissed.

23
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,400
When they were happy.

24
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,200
When they were sad.

25
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,100
My parents got married in 1955.

26
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,200
He was a museum director and she fixed up old houses.

27
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,000
They had a child and they stayed married for 44 years,

28
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,800
until she died in their bed,

29
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,380
after four months of cancer,

30
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,600
and eating French toast for every meal,

31
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,500
and watching the Teletubbies every day,

32
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,400
and confusing white straws for her cigarettes,

33
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,100
and skipping back and forth through time inside her head.

34
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,540
Six months later,

35
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,200
my father told me he was gay.

36
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,900
He had just turned 75.

37
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,300
I'm gay.

38
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,110
I always remember him

39
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,900
wearing a purple sweater when he told me this,

40
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,500
but, actually, he wore a robe.

41
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,100
I'm gay.

42
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,000
I loved your mother, but...

43
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,900
...now I want to explore this side.

44
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,600
I don't wanna be just theoretically gay.

45
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,500
I wanna do something about it.

46
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,800
He changed all his clothes.

47
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,900
He got a boyfriend, Andy,

48
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,000
a physical trainer who was also studying

49
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,700
for his professional pyrotechnic license.

50
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,420
Since I came out to my father,

51
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,000
he never speaks to me.

52
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,900
That's why I've been always attracted to older men.

53
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,800
He found an out gay priest to guide him spiritually.

54
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,900
He saw a therapist for the first time.

55
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,600
He joined the Prime Timers,

56
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,800
movie night,

57
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,100
Los Angeles Pride.

58
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,000
And then four years after he came out, he died in this room.

59
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,760
Look, it's lonely out here,

60
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,500
so you'd better learn how to talk with me.

61
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:47,190
I can understand 150 words but I can't speak.

62
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,800
I know. I know.

63
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,000
Calm. Calm, calm breaths.

64
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,700
Calm.

65
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,400
Oliver!

66
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,100
Please help me with all these ropes.

67
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,400
Pop, Pop, stop, stop, stop.

68
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,500
You're gonna hurt yourself.

69
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,400
Mr. Fields, we're gonna have to secure your arms again, okay?

70
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,000
You two married?

71
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,900
No, Pop.

72
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,000
Why not? She's great.

73
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,360
Yeah, she's a great nurse in the hospital,

74
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,000
but we don't really know her.

75
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,700
You're very high on drugs.

76
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,700
Yes, you've always had some very good reasons, haven't you?

77
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,200
No, Pop,

78
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,100
I just don't wanna be like you and Mom.

79
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,400
Well...

80
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,700
Thank you.

81
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,400
Oliver?

82
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,000
Ollie, you can do better.

83
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,700
That's good.

84
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,790
Go and have your own experiences with your own people.

85
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,700
I'll be right here.

86
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,200
I'm a human. I'm not a dog.

87
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,900
And you're a Jack Russell and that's a breed.

88
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,900
Your personality was created by this guy, John Russell,

89
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,500
who was a hunting enthusiast in the 1800s.

90
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,080
And he bred your ancestors for

91
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,300
their stamina and their courage for the hunt.

92
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,690
You think you're you when you wanna chase the foxes,

93
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,300
but other people planted that in you years ago.

94
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,700
And now, somewhat arbitrarily,

95
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,200
you're considered very cute by us humans.

96
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,900
And we keep breeding you not to chase foxes,

97
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,300
but to be cute.

98
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,100
And we put you in television shows and movies,

99
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,500
and you're chasing tennis balls

100
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,900
because they're as close to a fox as you're gonna get.

101
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,400
- Hey, Liz. - Hey.

102
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,500
Let's read this one. I found a lot of books.

103
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,800
Yeah, all right.

104
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,000
Give me the flashlight.

105
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,500
- Nice. - That's nice.

106
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,500
Andy brought those for you.

107
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,900
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah.

108
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,200
Who did that painting?

109
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,000
Well, I don't know. It's just a painting on the wall.

110
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,200
And these?

111
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,900
They're just photos, Pop.

112
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,000
But how do they relate to the exhibit?

113
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,400
They're just personal photos. They're not art.

114
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,500
And that's the water sprinkler thing.

115
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,800
Well, it's beautiful.

116
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,800
What is?

117
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,600
Putting the Japanese Gardens there. It's just beautiful.

118
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
Hal?

119
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,500
Andy!

120
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,700
I brought something for you.

121
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,700
We made a recording for you.

122
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,700
Oh, God.

123
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,100
This is for our friend, Hal Fields.

124
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,400
Oh, my God.

125
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,600
Yeah.

126
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,600
Jesus, Liz. Another band that wants portraits.

127
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,500
Well, at least it pays the rent.

128
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,600
You do something decent once and that's all people ever want.

129
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,200
Hi, Liz.

130
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,200
- Oliver? - Yeah?

131
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,600
The pen is not your friend.

132
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,900
The paper is not your friend.

133
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,300
The party is your friend. We're your friends.

134
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,600
Your friends are your friends.

135
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,400
Okay?

136
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,700
I've got the skills.

137
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,400
He's got the moves.

138
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,100
I've got the moves.

139
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,700
You've got the skills.

140
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,400
Arthur, you haven't been invited to this party.

141
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,300
You're gonna stay and look after the house.

142
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,600
You remember when Oliver was funny,

143
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,400
and he could actually, like, talk in complete sentences?

144
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,500
Funny, funny... I don't think...

145
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,500
Funny. Yeah.

146
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,250
Fun. But not funny,

147
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,000
unless, like, serious is funny.

148
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,600
Then he's fucking hilarious. But...

149
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,800
Lovable. Lovable.

150
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,000
Yeah, very lovable.

151
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,600
You are very lovable.

152
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,700
Hey, what's up!

153
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,800
Step aside.

154
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,900
Step aside.

155
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,400
He is so cute! Does he do tricks?

156
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,500
No.

157
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,300
His name is Arthur. He doesn't do tricks.

158
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,500
- No? - No.

159
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,700
Arthur. Sit.

160
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,200
Oh, my God!

161
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,400
Hi. Shake.

162
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,900
Oh, my God. He's so cute. I want him.

163
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,300
Does it make you feel powerful to order my dog around?

164
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,800
Maybe give you a sense of power?

165
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,500
You're being a therapist!

166
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,500
Freud!

167
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,000
Thanks, yeah. Very good.

168
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,300
Bye, Arthur.

169
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,300
Well, I didn't ask for this. Who would ask for this?

170
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,900
This color, this nose, this cheek, this chin.

171
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,400
You know, this is my life.

172
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,100
This isn't a story. This isn't a joke.

173
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,300
Yeah.

174
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,200
I'm so glad you came, Doc.

175
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,000
Just really good to get this stuff off my chest.

176
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,100
I'm sorry. Our time is up

177
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,900
for this week.

178
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,200
Thank you for coming in.

179
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,100
I was just...

180
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,800
I was gonna take a break, actually.

181
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
Okay.

182
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,500
I guess we should start with your mother.

183
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,000
Well, then, your father.

184
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,000
I don't understand. You can't talk?

185
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,400
Is it a mental problem? Do you need analysis?

186
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,300
It's a physical problem.

187
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,700
I was doing such a good job of hiding it.

188
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,100
How could you tell?

189
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,000
Clearly, I'm gonna need a drink.

190
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,200
You?

191
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,200
You stay here. Yeah.

192
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,900
No, it's not a natural color for a chicken.

193
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,600
And you see what happens when you free yourself from the cage,

194
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,700
walk away from the factory?

195
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,400
You just have no real color. You're like...

196
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,800
Hey, can you...

197
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,100
Hey, there.

198
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,400
Uh-oh. One. Uh-oh. Two.

199
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,500
Two drinks.

200
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,700
What does that mean... One, two.

201
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,900
Well, that's two people.

202
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,830
Two people. A girl and a guy?

203
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:53,300
Hopefully.

204
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,800
Yeah. Wow. Making moves.

205
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,500
Hello?

206
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,800
- Oliver? - Yeah.

207
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
I'm not sorry I woke you.

208
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,900
I went to Act Bar tonight.

209
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,500
- You did? - Yeah.

210
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,000
They had some wonderfully loud music.

211
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,500
What kind of music is that?

212
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,200
Probably house music.

213
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,300
House music. Okay.

214
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,200
House, house music.

215
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,100
Did you meet anyone?

216
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,000
- Did you meet anyone? - No.

217
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,500
Young gay men don't go for older gay men.

218
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,500
You have it easy.

219
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,000
Would you like to dance?

220
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,700
Hello.

221
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,200
Can I give you my number?

222
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,300
Thanks.

223
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,570
Tell him we will be swallowed up by darkness.

224
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,090
If nothing drastic happens right now.

225
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,060
I feel bad dragging Arthur to the party.

226
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,100
I should get home.

227
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,300
It was really nice meeting you.

228
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,000
Au revoir.

229
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,100
Yeah.

230
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,700
Hello?

231
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,900
Is that you?

232
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,800
One beep means "yes"?

233
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,440
I've always wanted to have

234
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,500
a phone call with someone who doesn't talk.

235
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,900
You wanna do something?

236
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,100
Now?

237
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,900
Okay, I'm parked just right up the street.

238
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,600
Okay. You point, I'll drive.

239
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,900
This way?

240
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,500
Nice place.

241
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,700
Oh, my mother. My mother died five years ago.

242
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,100
Oh, man.

243
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,600
Oh, you spoke.

244
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,900
I'm not supposed to.

245
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,200
My father died two months ago, almost three.

246
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,700
He was gay.

247
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,200
He was gay the whole time they were married.

248
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,300
He came out after my mother died,

249
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,500
and he was 75 years old.

250
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,200
Sorry.

251
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,100
Can we just sleep?

252
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,400
Sure. Sure.

253
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,900
Oliver.

254
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,500
How long are you here when you get back?

255
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,900
A year?

256
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
A month?

257
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,300
Right. And then?

258
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,000
You're filming here. Acting.

259
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,700
And after?

260
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,200
Just somewhere else. Where?

261
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,800
Yes.

262
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,000
Hello, house. Hello, Oliver.

263
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,500
Jesus, Pop, you get so much mail.

264
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,400
Hal, it's remarkable how well you've recovered

265
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,000
from being on the ventilator.

266
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,600
But?

267
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,000
The bronchoscopy revealed a mass

268
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,600
about the size of a quarter located in your lower right lung.

269
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,400
I'm afraid the biopsy showed it's cancerous.

270
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,000
Uh-huh. I see.

271
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,100
It appears to have spread

272
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,800
to the large hilar lymph nodes in your chest and liver.

273
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,900
With the already weakened state of your heart and lungs,

274
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,800
surgery isn't possible, given its location.

275
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,800
We can start radiation treatments

276
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,400
and see if you're strong enough for chemo.

277
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,900
You will be able to go home.

278
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,300
Do you have any questions?

279
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,500
No.

280
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,300
Thank you.

281
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,200
I'm sorry.

282
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,300
Well, let's not rush out and tell everyone.

283
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,000
Andy?

284
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,100
No need to get him up a tree.

285
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,700
Can you read me something?

286
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,610
"The Brazilian ballet star

287
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:26,600
is already known not only as a skilled partner,

288
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,800
"but also as a gifted and versatile dancer

289
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,130
"who adeptly fields roles

290
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,200
ranging from the strictly classical..."

291
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,790
Yeah, he's fine. He sleeps on your bed.

292
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,900
But is he eating?

293
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,000
Yeah. Yeah, he's eating.

294
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,300
Oh, God, I worry so much about...

295
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,800
Oh. Here we are.

296
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,700
What have you got in there?

297
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,900
A slug.

298
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,900
Andy, you can't bring that kind of thing.

299
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,000
You cannot.

300
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,300
I can. Look.

301
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,600
Fuck you.

302
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,300
It's time for inspection.

303
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,200
- Hello, Mr Fields. - Hello.

304
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,900
I'm Andy. Hal's boyfriend.

305
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,300
I'm Sophia.

306
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,900
You know, I have the right to be here as much as anyone else.

307
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,200
Go take a walk. Calm yourself.

308
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,800
What was all that?

309
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,300
Andy hasn't had it easy, too.

310
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,400
Be nice to him.

311
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,100
Excuse me.

312
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,500
Andy,

313
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,600
where did you get these?

314
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,500
Guys, guys, this is to us.

315
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,500
Cheers.

316
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,700
Cheers.

317
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,200
Drinking is not allowed in the room.

318
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,900
It's not?

319
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,100
I'm sorry.

320
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,800
No, no, no. No, no.

321
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,100
She's a wonderful nurse.

322
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,300
Here's to healthcare.

323
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,500
To healthcare!

324
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,000
What did you do with my father? He was so polite.

325
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,800
Well, I invited him, but he never returns my calls.

326
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,200
Two, four, six, eight.

327
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,300
That's it? That's all you're gonna tell me.

328
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,400
I'm gonna meet her at her hotel again, okay?

329
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,800
You happy?

330
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,300
Yeah. I'm very happy.

331
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,200
Are you happy?

332
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,200
Here's eight.

333
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,400
We haven't actually had a conversation yet,

334
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,800
so, you know...

335
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,400
You're thinking about her all the time.

336
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,600
And you know that because?

337
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,900
Because you're not talking about it.

338
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,200
I know you.

339
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,200
It's true.

340
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,480
It's embarrassing.

341
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,100
I'm 38, falling for a girl again.

342
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,000
It's like I lost the instructions

343
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,480
or I never had them.

344
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,500
Where's Pop?

345
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,700
At the museum.

346
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,300
Is something wrong with you guys?

347
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,600
What, are you in the FBI?

348
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,600
No.

349
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,700
CIA?

350
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,800
No.

351
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,650
KGB?

352
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:57,500
No.

353
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,100
SLA? PTA?

354
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,200
No.

355
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,200
BMW?

356
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,200
There's nothing wrong with me and Pop.

357
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,500
When you feel bad, you go into your room

358
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,400
and scream as loud as you can for a minute or two

359
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,700
and then it's out of you.

360
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,100
It's called catharsis.

361
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,000
I don't feel like screaming.

362
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,900
You will.

363
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,200
What the fuck is that?

364
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,600
L-E-It. Elliot.

365
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,400
Well, that's ridiculous.

366
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,400
I know.

367
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,700
You're not very supportive.

368
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,600
Well, it's just like copying something

369
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,700
that someone, like, did 30 years ago in the Bronx.

370
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,900
Well, yeah. I'm a part of a tradition of civil disobedience.

371
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,800
Something bigger than myself.

372
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,700
How's it work?

373
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,400
You have to shake it. Shake it.

374
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,000
What was that?

375
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,260
Historical consciousness.

376
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,300
Something bigger than myself.

377
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,500
Let's do it again.

378
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,500
Okay, but when you see her,

379
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,680
don't tell her that you

380
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,000
painted historical consciousness on the wall.

381
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,800
He's sweet.

382
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,200
He misses your dad.

383
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,200
Maybe we could just talk for a second.

384
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,100
Right.

385
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:22,200
Well, my name is Anna.

386
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,900
You're worried you can't trust me

387
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,600
because you don't know who I am.

388
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,900
I get it. That makes sense to me.

389
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,000
Oliver, stop it.

390
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,700
This music's old.

391
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,500
It's black.

392
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:34,700
Black music's the deepest 'cause they suffered the most.

393
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,500
Them and the Jews.

394
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,300
In my next life,

395
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,300
I'm gonna marry a good hot-blooded Jew.

396
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,300
Someone full of emotion.

397
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,000
I'm Jewish, right?

398
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,400
You're a quarter.

399
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,100
I'm a half.

400
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,000
Your father's none.

401
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,700
He has the least emotions.

402
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,000
You'll have more emotions than him.

403
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,800
But I'll have the most emotions.

404
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:10,980
You get to play chauffeur,

405
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,900
but only to the bottom of the hill.

406
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,600
You're turning into a wonderful driver.

407
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,600
Excuse me, Mrs. Fields?

408
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,900
What, you're not allowed to interact with the art?

409
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,800
Well, it's just that...

410
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,000
You too? You like being a good citizen?

411
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
No.

412
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,400
Can you toss me my camisole?

413
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,800
No, my camisole.

414
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,100
Camisole?

415
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,600
You don't know what a camisole is?

416
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,000
I was brought up by these animals,

417
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,500
and they didn't like questions.

418
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,100
They were very frowned upon. So, I had to guess.

419
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,700
You can ask me anything.

420
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,700
Anything?

421
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,900
What's that there?

422
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,700
That's a tree.

423
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,100
And cars.

424
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,800
Another building like this one.

425
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,900
Right.

426
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,500
People in the building like us.

427
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,200
Half of them think things will never work out.

428
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,200
The other half believe in magic.

429
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,800
It's like a war between them.

430
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
How do you know so much about people?

431
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,400
Well, you have to learn how to read their faces.

432
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,700
For example...

433
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,400
Here is mad.

434
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,600
Happy.

435
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,000
Sometimes it's just nothing.

436
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,400
Oh, yeah?

437
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,400
This is nothing.

438
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,700
And they are good at looking one way

439
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,900
and being another way.

440
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,800
You don't know me. I like that.

441
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,900
No, that's not true.

442
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,000
Oh, yeah?

443
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,700
Yeah, you have blonde hair that goes down to about here.

444
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,050
You smoke in non-smoking rooms.

445
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:11,400
You bite sometimes.

446
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,900
Okay, open your eyes.

447
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,860
Yeah, you drive on the sidewalk.

448
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,500
You were raised by animals.

449
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,740
Sometimes you look very alone,

450
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,300
like you just got here.

451
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,500
Yeah, you see, you don't know me at all.

452
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:39,330
I've never seen such a girl.

453
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,900
Someone flashy walks into

454
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,200
your life and you're just gonna fall for it.

455
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:47,340
When are you getting married ?

456
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,200
No, it doesn't work like that.

457
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,600
There are other steps, it's complicated.

458
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,550
I hope this feeling will last.

459
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,300
Yeah. Me, too.

460
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,000
What happened with Michelle?

461
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,000
I don't know. You know.

462
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,300
She seemed great.

463
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,100
She was great.

464
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,800
Well, maybe you should take out a personal ad, you know,

465
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,700
where you can explain your situation.

466
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,500
My situation?

467
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,700
Yeah.

468
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,900
I mean, you wanna be in a relationship

469
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,300
and you can't stay in one.

470
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,030
That's your fatherly advice,

471
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:23,800
personal ads?

472
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,900
Well...

473
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,600
A lot of people use them.

474
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,500
I did.

475
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,700
What?

476
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,760
If Andy wasn't going to be monogamous,

477
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,200
why should I be?

478
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,800
Jesus, Pop.

479
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,400
Jesus yourself. Yeah?

480
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,500
You look great, Hal. So handsome.

481
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,500
Hello, house. Hello, Hal.

482
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,900
Hello, Hal.

483
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,400
Oh, God, what have you got this time?

484
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,700
It's a green caterpillar.

485
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,500
No, no, no, you don't have a green caterpillar.

486
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,900
Yeah, I do.

487
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,700
Oh, my God. Gross! Oh, Jesus.

488
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,000
Hey, you going?

489
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,500
Yeah. Michael's in town.

490
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,100
Right.

491
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,100
I thought he was your boyfriend.

492
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,000
At least I'm the number one boyfriend.

493
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,600
Pop.

494
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,300
My stomach.

495
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,600
All right, come on.

496
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,500
Come on.

497
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,600
Well, let's say...

498
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,200
Arthur, down.

499
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,200
Let's say, since you were little,

500
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:05,200
and you always dreamed of some day getting a lion?

501
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,200
And you wait and you wait and you wait and you wait,

502
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,700
and the lion doesn't come.

503
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,000
Then along comes a giraffe.

504
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:21,800
You can be alone or you can be with the giraffe.

505
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,500
I'd wait for the lion.

506
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,000
That's why I worry about you.

507
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,400
Here.

508
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,000
You see, you'd like me to be with someone like me.

509
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,700
I like Andy because he isn't like me.

510
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,500
He's fun.

511
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,800
Hey, what'd you get?

512
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:46,400
Liv Ullmann. Very serious.

513
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:51,500
And I found this crazy book.

514
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,200
That's kind of a classic American thing.

515
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:02,500
Maybe we can figure out some classic American things to do.

516
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,500
Yeah.

517
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,800
Like 75. Mmm-hmm.

518
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,200
Or 75 all the way through...

519
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,300
Through 80.

520
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,500
Louise Brooks, star of silent screen,

521
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:21,200
effectively banned from Hollywood in the early '30s,

522
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,300
ended up working as a salesgirl at Saks Fifth Avenue.

523
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,600
I love her.

524
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,900
And Veronica Lake.

525
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Was a pin-up model and a film star.

526
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,510
Success was short-lived,

527
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:33,500
a series of broken marriages.

528
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,200
She struggled with mental illness and alcoholism.

529
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,900
She died of hepatitis at the age of fifty-three.

530
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,900
All these actor stories end sad.

531
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,200
I can tell you that already.

532
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,100
That's not a good thing.

533
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,600
So. Now I want real Mexican food.

534
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,200
And I want to try page

535
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:06,800
forty-six.

536
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
- No. - Yeah.

537
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,200
Really?

538
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,700
It's really good.

539
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,800
What do you think?

540
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,400
It's so good.

541
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,600
It's good. Mmm.

542
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,300
- I wasn't sure you'd like it. - Why?

543
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:36,700
You're an actress and staying in that fancy hotel.

544
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,200
I like this place.

545
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,100
I used to love hotels.

546
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,180
But now I'm always in a

547
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:52,400
new apartment or in another hotel somewhere.

548
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:57,100
How do you keep hold of friends? Or boyfriends?

549
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,900
Makes it very easy to end up alone.

550
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,200
To leave people.

551
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,800
You can stay in the same

552
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,900
place and still find ways to leave people.

553
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,200
You are like that?

554
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:31,900
It's what you do?

555
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,600
So, we are the same?

556
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,600
Yeah, I guess so.

557
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,600
Oh, did I wake you?

558
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,800
Yeah. Thank you, Maria.

559
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,100
And now that you're here,

560
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,200
would you please put those up there?

561
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,200
What are you... Pop.

562
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,300
What...

563
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:23,400
I'm reorganizing.

564
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,700
Prednisone makes you crazy.

565
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,800
I'm just not sleepy. I feel great.

566
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,300
Pop, you should rest.

567
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:39,300
Soon as I finish these papers. Right, papers?

568
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:43,500
Right, Hal. As soon as you're done, you can rest.

569
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:56,900
What?

570
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,200
Nothing. You're pretty.

571
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,500
No.

572
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,100
Yeah.

573
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,300
Jewish girls are not pretty.

574
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,500
They can be interesting or cute, but not pretty.

575
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,200
You're kidding, right?

576
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,900
That's what my mom told me.

577
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,700
She did not.

578
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,700
No, you're right.

579
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,600
This girl at school told me that,

580
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,640
and I went home and my mom said,

581
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,200
''Anna, who told you that?''

582
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,640
This is what it looks like

583
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,200
when Anna tells me about being Jewish in 2003.

584
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,300
And when I tell her my mother was Jewish.

585
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,100
And that my father turned in his gay badge

586
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,200
when my mother turned in her Jewish badge.

587
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,500
And they got married in 1955.

588
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,600
My mother didn't know she was Jewish until she was thirteen.

589
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,800
It was 1938.

590
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,200
This is what people looked like.

591
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,600
And lions and giraffes.

592
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,300
This man was the Man of the Year.

593
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,090
Her father tried to hide that they were Jewish.

594
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,800
This is the swim team that asked her to leave

595
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,700
once they discovered that she was Jewish.

596
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:04,200
This is what pretty looked like in 1938.

597
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:08,000
My father realized he was gay when he was thirteen.

598
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,400
It was 1938.

599
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,600
This is what pretty looked like.

600
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,900
This is the high school where they first met.

601
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,100
This is the war they both went to.

602
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,900
And this man was popular when they met again.

603
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,220
This is the only place

604
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:24,500
my father could hide and have sex in the '50s.

605
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,900
My father said if you got caught by the vice squad,

606
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,400
you could lose everything.

607
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,300
This is everything.

608
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,400
My father laid down on a couch like this,

609
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,500
and told the psychiatrist all his problems in 1955.

610
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:41,700
The doctor told him that homosexuality was a mental illness,

611
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,400
but it could be cured.

612
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,100
Not everyone got cured.

613
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,300
This is where my parents lived in 1955.

614
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,000
And this is

615
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,500
the home where the first gay-rights group were secretly meeting.

616
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:55,500
While they were reciting their vows here in this church,

617
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,000
Allen Ginsberg was writing his famous poem,

618
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,300
Howl, blocks away in this room.

619
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,800
"...who let themselves be fucked in the ass

620
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,200
by saintly motorcyclists,

621
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,000
and screamed with joy,

622
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,800
who blew and were blown by those human seraphim, the sailors,

623
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,700
caresses of Atlantic and Caribbean love..."

624
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,180
Just do the portrait of them.

625
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,900
It's an album cover, right?

626
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:02,900
That's all they want. Yeah?

627
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,500
Yeah.

628
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,600
Right.

629
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,300
- Here, Pop. - Oh, God.

630
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,300
I know, I know. Come on.

631
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:32,400
Hey, no, no, no. That's Gay Pride Day stuff. Just leave those.

632
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:34,200
All right.

633
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,200
And that's gay book club. You better leave those, too.

634
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,000
But what about the chair? Is the chair gay?

635
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,200
The chair is not gay. Obviously.

636
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,600
Pop, Pop, the cord won't go so far.

637
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,100
To hell with it.

638
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,900
Oh, what's that?

639
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,400
Now that you're out of the hospital,

640
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,600
you'll have to exercise, get you back into shape.

641
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,200
That's a great idea.

642
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,200
Okay, let's try it. I'll show you how.

643
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,300
Yeah, later on.

644
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:08,900
I'm gonna make myself some tea.

645
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:12,100
Okay. I'll go clean it up. It's a little bit...

646
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,800
Your mother's vase needs some flowers.

647
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,800
You need to tell Andy that you're not well.

648
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,500
Pop, you're just out of the hospital. You should take it easy.

649
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:28,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

650
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,000
You'll tell him, won't you?

651
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:34,900
Me?

652
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,300
Please.

653
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,700
You know, I tried to have sex with women?

654
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,100
- Yeah? - Yeah.

655
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:09,400
I just wanted you to know, I tried. It just... It didn't work.

656
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,500
Hey, I don't have a problem with gay guys.

657
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,200
Have you had sex with a man?

658
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:18,200
No.

659
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:23,600
I heard that if a man hasn't had sex with another man,

660
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,900
he's always afraid of gay men.

661
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,700
You know, they're a threat.

662
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,500
I don't know, Andy.

663
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,200
I didn't want you to feel threatened.

664
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:37,700
I don't wanna have sex with you.

665
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,600
What I do,

666
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,800
most people wouldn't even call it sex anyway.

667
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,300
Okay. Okay.

668
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:03,300
I couldn't tell him.

669
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:07,800
That's okay.

670
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,400
No, it's not.

671
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:14,500
You can't hide this from him. He loves you.

672
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,700
For someone with so much relationship advice,

673
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:22,000
you seem awfully alone.

674
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,000
Just act natural.

675
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,000
When he's not looking, we'll make a run for it.

676
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:39,800
Okay?

677
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,200
Don't, don't, don't.

678
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,100
It's my dad.

679
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,800
He's that bad?

680
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:20,700
I'm gonna let you be me.

681
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:25,300
Okay.

682
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,700
Annie?

683
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:33,700
Oui.

684
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,700
C'est toi, chижrie?

685
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:37,090
Oui, papa.

686
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,600
You never call me back.

687
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:47,200
I'm busy. I'm shooting all the time.

688
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:52,600
You know, I can't stop thinking about...

689
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,800
you know, about it,

690
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:56,800
doing it.

691
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,100
Doing what?

692
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,000
Killing myself.

693
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:06,000
You are the only one I can tell that to.

694
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,300
You should tell mom about that, not me.

695
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,300
You are my girl.

696
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,500
Now I'll have to kill you.

697
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,900
Just as it was going so well.

698
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,200
I know. I'm sorry.

699
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:46,900
Really?

700
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:04,900
Hey, Anna.

701
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,200
Hey, Oliver.

702
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,800
How do you feel about vandalism?

703
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,600
I don't know.

704
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:16,900
Pretty okay.

705
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:27,900
Oliver,

706
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,280
don't write any of that serious stuff, okay?

707
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,300
Just something funny.

708
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:32,800
Girls like funny.

709
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:33,900
- Okay? - Okay.

710
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:41,700
You know what? Here, give me Arthur.

711
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,800
We'll just stay here and get arrested.

712
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:44,800
You know, that's good.

713
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:47,300
Good?

714
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,300
You okay?

715
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

716
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,500
You okay?

717
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,600
Yeah. I'm gonna stay here with my new friend.

718
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,600
Okay.

719
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:12,100
Anna?

720
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:17,960
C'est bon ici.

721
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,700
I'm trying to impress you.

722
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:26,590
Really?

723
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,900
It's working.

724
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,900
Arthur, Arthur.

725
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,600
No, no, no, no. I'm sorry.

726
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,900
No problem. No problem.

727
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,800
What's with this card?

728
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:00,600
- Do you mind? - No.

729
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:05,300
- Thank you. - All right.

730
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:32,700
He looked like your dad.

731
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:35,400
Yeah.

732
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:49,000
Somewhere along the line,

733
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
he stopped admitting to himself that he was sick.

734
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Oliver, this is Blake. He's a wonderful man.

735
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,700
Look. I finally got a tattoo.

736
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:14,200
Registration purposes, of course.

737
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,600
Good for him.

738
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,200
We did a lot of shopping.

739
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:23,400
Bought all these books.

740
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,600
Hello, Hal.

741
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:25,600
Hello.

742
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,500
New clothes.

743
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,100
He was obsessed with Staples.

744
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,800
Bought a lot of plants.

745
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:37,900
A lot of parties.

746
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,400
Well, glad you could make it.

747
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,300
I thought I was cooking dinner.

748
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:47,300
It's movie night, you idiot.

749
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:51,500
Hal, you look wonderful.

750
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,900
I'm turning the corner on this thing.

751
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,000
Hi, Oliver.

752
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,300
Hey.

753
01:00:56,300 --> 01:01:00,200
These political letter-writing parties.

754
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:04,100
There was an out gay congressman he was supporting.

755
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:08,900
He hired a secretary he would dictate to.

756
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:11,200
And one May morning.

757
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,500
He started telling everyone he was getting better.

758
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:16,100
Why are you telling them you're turning the corner?

759
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:21,200
You have stage four cancer.

760
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:24,300
It's not as bad as it sounds.

761
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Pop,

762
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,600
there is no stage five.

763
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,700
That's not what it means.

764
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:34,400
Well, then what does it mean?

765
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:38,700
It just means that it's been through three other stages.

766
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:51,300
What movie are we watching?

767
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:54,100
The Times of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay politician...

768
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:55,200
Yeah, I know who Harvey Milk is.

769
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,200
Good, good.

770
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:59,200
"What really counts is that a person care.

771
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,000
Does a person care about his city or her city?

772
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Is a person sensitive..."

773
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,600
Wrote an essay about religion.

774
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:10,500
Eventually, Jesus grew old.

775
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,400
He could no longer walk far

776
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:15,200
and he could no longer preach in a loud voice.

777
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,200
One day he announced to his apostles that he was departing.

778
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,800
The three disciples prayed with him,

779
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,900
gave him water, bathed and fed him.

780
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,800
After gasping for breath for several days,

781
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,000
one morning, just as dawn came,

782
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:31,600
Jesus passed away.

783
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:37,100
You rewrote Jesus' death?

784
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,500
It was far too violent.

785
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:41,100
We need new stories.

786
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,300
For the first time I saw him really in love.

787
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,800
He sounds amazing.

788
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,000
But that must have been crazy for you.

789
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:47,900
Anna?

790
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:07,800
I couldn't sleep and I wanted to walk around.

791
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:13,400
You've lost so much.

792
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:17,400
What if I can't make it further?

793
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,900
If this is too much,

794
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:26,800
then we should just stop.

795
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,300
Wait, wait.

796
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:41,100
Wait, wait, wait.

797
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:44,700
I don't wanna stop.

798
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,400
- Ready? - Yeah!

799
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,700
- Again! - Again?

800
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,500
- Again! - Again!

801
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,200
Fuck!

802
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:14,800
Fuck!

803
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,100
Fuck!

804
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:17,200
Fuck!

805
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:19,600
Fuck!

806
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,700
Fuck!

807
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:25,100
- Fuck! - Fuck!

808
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:26,100
Arthur.

809
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:27,100
Arthur!

810
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,100
Come on, doggie, doggie.

811
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:30,300
Arthur.

812
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:32,100
- I'm gonna go this way. - I'm gonna go farther out.

813
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,600
Ah! You're awake.

814
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,900
Arthur says you have to get up.

815
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:47,000
He says it's his day off.

816
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,900
- He speaks to you, too. - Yeah.

817
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:51,900
He says now. Now. Now.

818
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,600
Your English is not so perfect.

819
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,200
And he said 10 minutes.

820
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,000
You okay?

821
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:13,900
You did really well.

822
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:15,500
Yeah, I can't believe that was your first time.

823
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:16,500
It was your first time.

824
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,800
You watching all the humans going around and around.

825
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,800
Excuse me, sir. There's no dogs allowed in the building.

826
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,400
You need to remove him from the premises, please.

827
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,600
If I leave him on his own, he loses all control.

828
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,200
I'm sorry. There's no dogs allowed in the building.

829
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,400
- Yeah, yeah, but... - Come on, please.

830
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,400
If I leave him in the car, he cries, he howls.

831
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,100
I can't leave him in the car.

832
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:31,700
I'm sorry, no. He needs to be removed.

833
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:35,200
I don't know what she's saying and I don't like it.

834
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,500
You need to remove the dog from the premises.

835
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:37,800
She's just talking in French. She's saying,

836
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,300
"It's okay, it's such a small dog."

837
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:41,100
- You're gonna call the authorities? - All right, you know what?

838
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:42,600
- She's calling the authorities. - Steal the skates.

839
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:43,700
Steal the skates.

840
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:50,300
- Okay? - Okay.

841
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,400
- Come on, Arthur. - Faster, faster.

842
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,650
Okay.

843
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:12,350
Sorry. Excuse me.

844
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,600
I can't do it.

845
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:31,000
He doesn't always call this much.

846
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,400
Sometimes he's fine.

847
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,700
Yeah, well.

848
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,000
He shouldn't do this to you.

849
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:51,500
Even if we don't answer the phone, he's still here.

850
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,400
I run somewhere new and...

851
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:02,200
You're leaving here soon.

852
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,200
Yeah.

853
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,700
I think you should come to my house.

854
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:10,800
Move in with me.

855
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:30,500
Would you want a strange girl like me?

856
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:33,200
Yeah, a lot.

857
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:39,200
Do you cook?

858
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:43,800
Yes.

859
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,700
I would love that.

860
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:05,900
I'm really gonna have to kill you now.

861
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:07,800
Mmm. Why?

862
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:10,600
Because I'm falling in love with you.

863
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:13,800
Anna and I are in a relationship in 2003.

864
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:15,800
This is what the sun looks like

865
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,200
and the stars.

866
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:19,600
This is what it looks like when we eat.

867
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:23,200
When we tell each other the stories in our heads.

868
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,400
I was born in 1965.

869
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,900
Anna was born in 1971.

870
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:29,500
This is what the sun looked like.

871
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,000
Her pets.

872
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,200
Her parents.

873
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,300
She left home when she was sixteen.

874
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:35,390
She lived here,

875
01:09:35,390 --> 01:09:36,390
and here,

876
01:09:36,570 --> 01:09:37,570
and here,

877
01:09:37,570 --> 01:09:38,970
and here.

878
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:43,300
She had three serious relationships. She left all of them.

879
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:46,800
I had four serious relationships. I left them, too.

880
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:49,100
Or let them fall apart.

881
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:51,100
We didn't go to this war.

882
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:53,100
We didn't have to hide to have sex.

883
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:55,300
Our good fortune allowed us to

884
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:58,000
feel a sadness that our parents didn't have time for,

885
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,400
and a happiness that I never saw with them.

886
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,300
We didn't know how we learned the stories in our heads,

887
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:07,600
but sometimes they stop running.

888
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,200
And I can really see Anna's eyes in 2003.

889
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:12,100
Her ears.

890
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:14,200
Her feet.

891
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,870
This is what it looks like when she says,

892
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:18,500
"I love you," in 2003.

893
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:22,000
This is what it looks like when she cries.

894
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,230
When she tells me there's

895
01:10:23,230 --> 01:10:25,200
always a new empty room waiting for her.

896
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,600
They used to make her feel free.

897
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:31,700
Now they make her feel the opposite of free.

898
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,800
- Last one. - Oh, Lord.

899
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,200
l know.

900
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,200
There.

901
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:22,300
- This is for you. - Yeah.

902
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:23,800
Now, that means Gay Pride.

903
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,200
Yeah, everyone knows that.

904
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,300
No, they don't.

905
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:28,300
Yeah. Everyone knows about that.

906
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:29,800
No. Of course not. Don't be silly.

907
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:33,400
Pop, pretty much everyone knows that that means Gay Pride.

908
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,000
- Do they really? - Yeah.

909
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,300
Did you know?

910
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,000
About me?

911
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:50,400
No.

912
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,200
l just thought you and Mom weren't in love.

913
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:56,800
We loved each other.

914
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:58,900
But you were gay the whole time.

915
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:00,700
Well, l worked hard not to be.

916
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:02,600
For 44 years?

917
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:03,600
Yeah.

918
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,700
l knew l was gay, though.

919
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:07,810
l mean, at parties l'd be

920
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:09,700
staring at the husbands and not the wives.

921
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,100
What about sex?

922
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:18,200
Well, she didn't think l was the greatest lover.

923
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:22,000
But we made do.

924
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,800
Look, l liked my life.

925
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,000
The museum, our house.

926
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:31,200
That's what l wanted.

927
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,700
And Mom.

928
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:33,900
You wanted Mom, too, right?

929
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:34,900
Yes!

930
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:36,300
Stop that.

931
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,000
She proposed to me, you know.

932
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,500
l said,

933
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:53,640
"Look, l love you, and we're great buddies,

934
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:55,200
but you know what l am."

935
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:56,400
And then she says,

936
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,500
"That doesn't matter.

937
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,000
l'll fix that."

938
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:10,600
l thought,

939
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:13,400
"Oh, God.

940
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,200
l'll try anything."

941
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,400
Sex.

942
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:26,800
Life.

943
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,300
Healing.

944
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:29,400
Sunlight.

945
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:30,500
Nature.

946
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:31,800
Magic.

947
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,000
Serenity.

948
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,300
Spirit.

949
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:37,470
The first Gay Pride flag

950
01:13:37,470 --> 01:13:40,500
was made by a man named Gilbert Baker in 1978.

951
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,700
He gave a meaning to each color.

952
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:44,400
This man was President.

953
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:45,800
This was invented.

954
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,600
This is what movies looked like.

955
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:48,700
Pets.

956
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:51,440
On November 27th, 1978,

957
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:54,100
Harvey Milk was shot and killed.

958
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,270
One week after, my father

959
01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:58,800
opened his annual museum Christmas exhibit.

960
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,500
He collected stuffed animals from people in the community

961
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,000
and he put them on display.

962
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:06,100
My father printed a quote from The Velveteen Rabbit

963
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:07,700
in large type on the wall.

964
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:11,600
The stuffed rabbit asked, "What is real?"

965
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:15,400
And the rabbit asked, "Does it hurt?"

966
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,500
And the horse said, "Sometimes."

967
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,900
"Does it happen all at once?"

968
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,100
"It takes a long time.

969
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,600
Generally, by the time you are real,

970
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,600
most of your hair has been loved off,

971
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,900
your eyes dropped out, and you get loose in the joints.

972
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:32,900
But these things don't matter at all

973
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,400
because you are real.

974
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:38,300
You can't be ugly except to people who don't understand."

975
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,300
Andy's moving in.

976
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:48,500
Yeah?

977
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:50,700
Is that a good idea?

978
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:56,000
Just be happy about it. Huh?

979
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
The Sads: First couple, too in love, to feel sad.

980
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:15,800
Come on.

981
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,500
This is the idea, is that it's the history of sadness.

982
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:22,500
Here could be your... This could be your...

983
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:26,000
You know, you're gonna need a big CD box.

984
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:31,300
Four billion years ago, Earth begins.

985
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:34,400
And the idea is that sadness has not yet been created, but...

986
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:36,800
l'm sorry.

987
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:39,300
l'm sorry, too.

988
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,000
Well, that went well.

989
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:57,400
Come on, Arthur.

990
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:08,100
This is the living room.

991
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,900
Dining room.

992
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:20,800
There are my... I have some boxes. They're my parents.

993
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:22,700
My mom.

994
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:24,400
Hal, Georgia, meet Anna.

995
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:26,900
Anna, Hal, Georgia.

996
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:32,600
- These are the stairs. - Oh, yeah?

997
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,100
They go up.

998
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:39,600
l emptied these for you.

999
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,400
l'll get your case.

1000
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,300
Are you okay?

1001
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:18,200
l couldn't sleep and l didn't want to bother you.

1002
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,000
l was...

1003
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:26,100
l was nervous

1004
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,200
and excited.

1005
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:34,100
l kept thinking, maybe,

1006
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:35,800
l'm not so lost.

1007
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:43,700
Why were you crying yesterday?

1008
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:34,800
You okay?

1009
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:37,000
Yeah.

1010
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:11,500
You look so unhappy.

1011
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,300
Well, are you happy?

1012
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:19,600
Here?

1013
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:27,700
Maybe I'm not perfect at it.

1014
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
I don't really know what I'm doing.

1015
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,600
But I wanna be here.

1016
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,700
I don't know, Anna.

1017
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:22,100
I don't think this is what I'm supposed to feel like.

1018
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:30,800
Okay.

1019
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:36,200
I will go back to New York then.

1020
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:06,600
Hal, you don't need to come in for any more treatments.

1021
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:08,900
Is there something wrong?

1022
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:10,700
It's best you stay home.

1023
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:14,000
Hospice can help you more now.

1024
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,100
Any more treatments would just

1025
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,400
cause more pain.

1026
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,100
Yeah, l understand.

1027
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,900
l'm sorry. I wish we could do more.

1028
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:32,500
No, no, you've, you've done an excellent job, Dr. Long.

1029
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:35,800
And thank you

1030
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:40,500
for coming to the party.

1031
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:10,500
You always wanted to hold my hand when you were little.

1032
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:15,600
l couldn't, you know. I was afraid it would look funny.

1033
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,300
l wanted to be close, you know,

1034
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:24,100
and my father certainly was never close with me.

1035
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:29,000
God, l hope l wasn't like that.

1036
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:33,000
l can barely remember you from when l was little.

1037
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:36,400
I guess I was at work.

1038
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,100
Look at the hand of the man in the brushwork.

1039
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:43,350
lt's as if you can feel

1040
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:47,300
the spirit of the artist, if he's very good.

1041
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:49,900
And his every gesture.

1042
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:54,700
lt's like a sort of structural entity in...

1043
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:57,000
l mean that in the...

1044
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Let's go home.

1045
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,800
...largest use of that word.

1046
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:07,500
What about your father? What will he possibly do without us?

1047
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:09,600
Georgia, are you leaving?

1048
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,100
Yes, Mary. It's an emergency.

1049
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:13,900
Oliver's appendix has ruptured.

1050
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:15,900
Oh, dear.

1051
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:19,000
He's a very composed child.

1052
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,900
You point, l'll drive.

1053
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:33,800
Ah! The infamous left.

1054
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:39,400
And?

1055
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:46,000
Left again. Going in circles. I like it.

1056
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:40,100
Hey, it's me. Leave me a message.

1057
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:42,200
Anna?

1058
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,300
Where are you?

1059
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:03,600
All right, here.

1060
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:07,900
- All right, Arthur. - okay.

1061
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,500
You're gonna look after Elliot.

1062
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:12,400
l'll be back in a couple of days.

1063
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:15,500
Good luck.

1064
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:16,600
All right.

1065
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:18,100
Okay? Thanks.

1066
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:53,600
He remembers me.

1067
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:36,500
Look, l'm so sorry,

1068
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:39,900
but I'm at your front door. I'm in New York.

1069
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:52,500
I am in Los Angeles.

1070
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:00,400
You're in LA?

1071
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,500
You said you were coming here.

1072
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:06,300
Yeah. But l didn't leave.

1073
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:10,200
Fuck. I'm in your building.

1074
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:20,600
Okay. See the window near to the radiator?

1075
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:24,400
There is a hide-a-key behind it.

1076
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,100
Okay, l'm inside.

1077
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:43,900
Well, there's, like, nothing here.

1078
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:46,500
No.

1079
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:52,300
This is my kitchen. It's where I eat.

1080
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:55,900
This is my bathroom.

1081
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,600
It's very fancy.

1082
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:03,900
Outside my window is my neighbor's roof.

1083
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:09,700
The room at the end is my bedroom.

1084
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:13,800
That's my closet.

1085
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:17,800
Those are my clothes.

1086
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,300
My pictures.

1087
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,900
Why do you leave everyone?

1088
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:32,500
Why did you let me go?

1089
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:43,900
Maybe because I don't really believe that it's gonna work.

1090
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:47,300
And then I make sure that it doesn't work.

1091
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:54,400
lsn't Juan's hair wonderful?

1092
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,100
Thanks.

1093
01:30:57,100 --> 01:30:59,000
l use this great mousse.

1094
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,800
Well, it's terrific.

1095
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:03,400
Do you wanna try something?

1096
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:05,300
Just a little bit?

1097
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:06,300
l don't think so.

1098
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:09,800
Come on. Just try a little bit. It'll be fun.

1099
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:11,600
- Yeah? - Yeah.

1100
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:13,800
How do you do it?

1101
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:16,000
Okay. I'm gonna show you how.

1102
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:43,300
- There. - Is that it?

1103
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:45,000
How do l look?

1104
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,300
Great.

1105
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:53,900
You look great.

1106
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:31,700
Oliver.

1107
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:34,400
He's gone.

1108
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:05,300
Once you make the call,

1109
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:07,200
you have less than an hour before two men

1110
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:09,500
come and place the body into a bag.

1111
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:14,300
They charge $1,485 for a cremation

1112
01:33:14,300 --> 01:33:16,700
and deliver the remains in a small, metal container

1113
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:19,100
the size of a jar of peanut butter.

1114
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,700
You will need to get a death certificate.

1115
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:23,540
You will need to make copies

1116
01:33:23,540 --> 01:33:25,400
and send them to cancel every credit card,

1117
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:29,390
phone account, utility, gym membership,

1118
01:33:29,390 --> 01:33:33,000
every insurance policy, mortgage, to settle their taxes.

1119
01:33:33,700 --> 01:33:36,500
You will have all their mail forwarded to your address.

1120
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:39,500
You will write their obituary.

1121
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:42,900
You run it with a photo in the paper for $2 a word.

1122
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:44,800
You'll wonder if it's right.

1123
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:47,600
You'll throw a lot of their stuff away.

1124
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:50,600
You'll bring a lot of their stuff to your house.

1125
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:54,200
This is the photo my mother kept in her bedroom.

1126
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:57,600
When I was a kid, I thought that was my arm giving her daisies.

1127
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:00,010
Now I make a new mistake and I

1128
01:34:00,010 --> 01:34:02,500
think it's her arm giving me the daisies, saying,

1129
01:34:02,700 --> 01:34:06,000
"Here. Here is simple and happy.

1130
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,100
That's what I meant to give you. "

1131
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:18,800
Arthur.

1132
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:26,000
Thank you.

1133
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:31,500
Thanks.

1134
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:33,900
Sure.

1135
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:36,400
Come on.

1136
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:40,300
It's because l'm gay.

1137
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:42,800
Isn't it?

1138
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:44,700
What?

1139
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:48,000
You never called or came to see me.

1140
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,000
No.

1141
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:58,000
No, it's because my father loved you so much.

1142
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:26,800
Arthur.

1143
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:35,100
Hey, how have you been? How have you been?

1144
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:51,300
Come in, come in.

1145
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:58,300
The living room.

1146
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:00,700
Dining room.

1147
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:12,900
Crazy picture.

1148
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:13,900
Yeah.

1149
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:17,100
- Can l read it? - Sure.

1150
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,200
"l'm looking for sex

1151
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:24,600
with the hope it turns into

1152
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,300
friendship or a relationship.

1153
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:29,600
But I don't insist on monogamy.

1154
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:35,300
I'm an old senior guy, 78, but I'm attractive and horny.

1155
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:37,500
I'm an art historian, now retired.

1156
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,900
And in addition to art, I like houses, gardens,

1157
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:44,100
parties and walking with my Jack Russell.

1158
01:36:44,100 --> 01:36:47,700
I'm 5'11, 160 pounds.

1159
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:52,000
l'm trim, gray hair, blue eyes, hairy cheest."

1160
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,200
- Chest. - Chest?

1161
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:57,200
- "l like giving and..." - And what?

1162
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:59,100
"l like giving and getting rubdowns

1163
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:02,000
and then going into the mutual soft stuff."

1164
01:37:04,900 --> 01:37:09,500
"I have a nice house with food, drinks, friend and me.

1165
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:12,300
"If you are willing to try an older guy,

1166
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:14,600
let's meet and see what happens."

1167
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:20,700
He didn't give up.

1168
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:53,400
What happens now?

1169
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:57,700
I don't know.

1170
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:02,600
How does that work?
