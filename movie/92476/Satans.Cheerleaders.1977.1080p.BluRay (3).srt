He invented being bull-headed so we could be the best at something.

Then he feasted on him, starting with his feet.

Lions don't eat this way. Are you sure this was a lion?

On that I choose to remain dubious. Two are dead now in two nights.

There's even less of him than there was of Mahina.

It's too soon for a lion to kill from hunger.

In our village, we construct thorn bush fences around where we live.

Big burning fires at night. That keeps the lion away.

Good. Get started.

And a strict curfew. No one is allowed out of their tent at night.

Abdullah, send half your men with SamueI to build these fences.

I told you to be careful.

00:33:01,762 --> 00:33:04,562
"And the king said to DanieI, 'DanieI, servant of the living God',"

"'is thy God whom thou servest, able to deliver thee from the lions?"'

"And DanieI said unto the king, 'Oh, King, live forever. "'

"'My God hath sent his angeI and hath shut the lions' mouths"'

"'that they have not hurt me, forasmuch innocence was found in me,"'

00:33:20,862 --> 00:33:24,962
"'and as before thee, oh King, have I done no hurt. "'

"'Have I done no hurt. "'

372
00:33:29,662 --> 00:33:33,062
The men called them the Ghost and the Darkness.

373
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:36,762
There were two of them, and that had never happened before

374
00:33:36,862 --> 00:33:40,062
because man-eaters are always alone.

375
00:33:40,262 --> 00:33:44,662
They owned the night but they also attacked in daylight.

376
00:33:44,862 --> 00:33:48,762
Alone or together. Without fear or reason.

377
00:33:48,962 --> 00:33:51,262
Some thought they were not lions at all,

378
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:55,462
but the spirits of dead medicine men come back to spread madness.

379
00:33:55,662 --> 00:34:00,862
Or they were the devil sent to stop the white man from owning the world.

No, in point of fact it didn't. But it was still a good idea.

It would've been a beautifuI bridge. It's funny how I didn't notice it before.

753
01:11:25,262 --> 01:11:28,962
I guess I had some other things on my mind.

754
01:11:29,162 --> 01:11:32,262
Not actually something I would appreciate, but...

755
01:11:32,462 --> 01:11:37,962
I got up this morning and... It's just such a pretty design.

756
01:11:39,062 --> 01:11:42,162
The setting's so beautifuI...

01:11:51,062 --> 01:11:52,662
Yeah.

760
01:11:55,562 --> 01:11:58,062
The getting up is up to you.

761
01:12:01,262 --> 01:12:03,262
They're only lions.

762
01:12:06,562 --> 01:12:09,462
Yeah, yeah, they're only lions.

763
01:12:09,662 --> 01:12:14,162
Well, I just saw some fresh paw prints heading up that way.

764
01:12:15,662 --> 01:12:18,762
So I guess we've both been hit.

765
01:12:20,262 --> 01:12:22,462
Let's go after them.

766
01:12:34,862 --> 01:12:38,162
When I was growing up, there was a bully in my hometown.

767
01:12:38,262 --> 01:12:43,662
He used to terrorise everybody. But he wasn't the problem.

768
01:12:43,862 --> 01:12:48,162
He had a brother who was worse than him. He wasn't the problem, either.

769
01:12:48,262 --> 01:12:53,262
One or the other was always in jaiI. Problem was when they were together.

770
01:12:54,362 --> 01:12:59,562
Alone they were just bullies, but together... they were lethaI.

771
01:12:59,762 --> 01:13:03,862
- They were reaI killers. - What happened to them?

772
01:13:04,062 --> 01:13:06,162
Well, I got bigger.

They're doing it for the pleasure.

798
01:16:42,062 --> 01:16:45,762
- They'll know we've been here. - Oh, my God.

799
01:17:07,862 --> 01:17:11,362
- Both of them. - Yeah, it's both of them.

800
01:17:17,062 --> 01:17:20,562
- Have you ever used a machan? - A what?

801
01:17:20,662 --> 01:17:24,962
- A machan. - Is it something you learnt in India?

802
01:17:26,562 --> 01:17:30,062
I figure they got used to me in trees, so...

803
01:17:31,162 --> 01:17:35,162
if we... put this in a clearing...

804
01:17:35,362 --> 01:17:37,962
I'm not quite sure of the scale.

805
01:17:40,262 --> 01:17:44,362
- It might be too small for the both of us. - No, it won't.

806
01:17:44,462 --> 01:17:47,962
I ain't gonna be there. This is your idea, you get up on that thing.

807
01:17:51,562 --> 01:17:53,662
So, you want me to be bait alone.

808
01:17:53,862 --> 01:17:57,562
That's right. I'm gonna be in some tree too far away to protect you.

809
01:18:00,262 --> 01:18:03,162
Now, can you controI your fear?.

810
01:18:03,962 --> 01:18:06,062
I suppose I'll have to.

811
01:18:18,362 --> 01:18:21,162
Lions hate the sound of a baboon.

812
01:18:21,262 --> 01:18:25,162
Anything to make your evening more enjoyable.

813
01:18:25,362 --> 01:18:28,162
Hey, this here's for you.

814
01:18:28,362 --> 01:18:30,162
You might need it.

815
01:18:53,862 --> 01:18:57,862
This certainly is the best opportunity those lions have had to kill you.

816
01:19:01,062 --> 01:19:03,362
Good luck.

817
01:19:06,562 --> 01:19:09,462
Including the workers that I've lost and your knowledge of man-eaters,

818
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:13,562
- how many do you think they've killed? - More than any other lion.

819
01:19:13,762 --> 01:19:16,562
A hundred. Maybe more.

820
01:19:16,662 --> 01:19:19,762

Because he's just like one of those bullies now.

He's alone for the first time and he's afraid.

Somehow, I don't think he's afraid of me.

857
01:25:21,362 --> 01:25:25,162
I just keep wondering if we're gonna remember all this.

858
01:25:26,462 --> 01:25:30,662
I love Africa. I could never forget her.

859
01:25:32,262 --> 01:25:35,062
You're young, Johnny, I mean...

860
01:25:35,262 --> 01:25:38,162
So many things flash by and at that moment you say,

861
01:25:38,362 --> 01:25:42,362
"Oh, yeah, this is gonna stay with me. Surely... "

862
01:25:42,462 --> 01:25:47,562
"I will never forget this dawn... this hunt... "

863
01:25:48,862 --> 01:25:51,862
"... this passion", and then...

864
01:25:53,362 --> 01:25:55,162
It's all gone.

865
01:25:56,262 --> 01:25:58,862
Well, I hope it stays here.

866
01:26:01,762 --> 01:26:04,762
- Another toast. - To memory.

867
01:26:04,962 --> 01:26:06,562
To memory.

868
01:26:08,962 --> 01:26:15,362
I wanted to remember building the railroad, the iron snake.

869
01:26:15,562 --> 01:26:20,962
I was so excited. And now, I can't think why.

870
01:26:25,862 --> 01:26:28,762
I know why I wanted to build the bridge,

871
01:26:28,962 --> 01:26:32,262
but I can tell you the memory I wanted most.

872
01:26:32,462 --> 01:26:34,462
To see my son come into the world.

873
01:26:36,262 --> 01:26:40,562
To bring worlds together. Now...

874
01:26:43,562 --> 01:26:49,562
Well, my life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder and...

875
01:26:49,762 --> 01:26:52,162
It took me around the world.

876
01:26:54,262 --> 01:26:57,362
The memory that I wanted...

877
01:26:57,562 --> 01:27:00,262
That was the family that I lost.

878
01:27:03,062 --> 01:27:05,362
You know, Charles...

879
01:27:07,862 --> 01:27:11,962
You're a rather cheerfuI fellow when you get to know you.

880
01:27:18,062 --> 01:27:22,262
Well, I should've warned you. Good night.

881
01:27:24,362 --> 01:27:26,462
Oh, Johnny...

882
01:27:27,862 --> 01:27:31,562
When you meet your son, you hold him high.

883
01:27:51,262 --> 01:27:53,162
Excuse me.

884
01:27:54,862 --> 01:27:58,162
- I'd like to see John Patterson, please. - Yes, ma'am.

885
01:27:58,362 --> 01:28:03,562
Could you tell him that his wife... that his family has come to see him.

886
01:28:10,362 --> 01:28:11,662
Sorry.
