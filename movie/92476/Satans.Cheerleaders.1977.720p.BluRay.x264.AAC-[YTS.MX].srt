00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:45,028
Okay everybody, get ready!

5
00:01:45,111 --> 00:01:46,070
It's gonna be fun.

6
00:01:46,154 --> 00:01:47,070
Okay.
- Woo!

7
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:48,114
One, two, three , four...

8
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,159
Two bits, four bits,
six bits, a dollar.

9
00:01:51,326 --> 00:01:54,286
All for Huskies,
stand up and holler.

10
00:01:54,287 --> 00:01:55,955
(cheering)

11
00:01:56,164 --> 00:01:58,248
You guys, I loved it.

12
00:01:58,249 --> 00:02:01,961
I thought it was adorable
and you all look perfect, but...

13
00:02:02,503 --> 00:02:06,548
I don't think the principle
or the board of education

14
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:08,634
is gonna like all that...
(dancing)

15
00:02:08,635 --> 00:02:09,468
You know?

16
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:10,135
Yeah.
- Yeah.

17
00:02:10,136 --> 00:02:10,886
So...

18
00:02:10,887 --> 00:02:11,845
Why don't you show us
then Teach.

19
00:02:11,846 --> 00:02:14,097
Yeah, come on.
- Yeah, get up there, we'll watch.

20
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:15,266
That's a good idea.

21
00:02:15,475 --> 00:02:16,184
Okay.

22
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:19,103
Two bit, four bits,
six bits a dollar,

23
00:02:19,646 --> 00:02:22,440
all for the Huskies,
stand up and holler.

24
00:02:23,149 --> 00:02:24,734
All right.
- Thanks, Teach.

25
00:02:24,942 --> 00:02:25,568
Thanks, Coach.

26
00:02:25,693 --> 00:02:26,319
Okay, let's try one.?????

27
00:02:27,111 --> 00:02:29,488
One, two, three, four.

28
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:32,699
Two bits, four bits,
six bits a dollar,

29
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,077
all for Huskies,
stand up and holler.

30
00:02:35,078 --> 00:02:39,999
(song)

31
00:02:48,466 --> 00:02:50,884
You sure you girls wouldn't
rather play tackle?

32
00:02:50,885 --> 00:02:53,345
It's first we touch then tackle.
Right, girls?

33
00:02:53,346 --> 00:02:54,054
Right.

34
00:02:54,055 --> 00:02:55,681
Just make sure you
don't get hurt

35
00:02:55,682 --> 00:02:57,350
when I knock you on your ass.

36
00:02:58,518 --> 00:02:59,602
Hike.
(whistle)

37
00:03:02,105 --> 00:03:03,189
Ugh!
(laughing)

38
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:08,902
Yeah!

39
00:03:08,903 --> 00:03:11,030
(cheering)

40
00:03:18,413 --> 00:03:20,998
Huskie cheerleaders have a ball.

41
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:28,213
Heck of a job Miss J.,
heck of a job.

42
00:03:28,214 --> 00:03:29,631
You just keep up the good work.

43
00:03:29,632 --> 00:03:31,718
Oh, thank you,
this is so much fun.

44
00:03:32,927 --> 00:03:33,928
(whistle)

45
00:03:40,935 --> 00:03:42,145
(whistle)

46
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:46,064
Debbie, are you all right.

47
00:03:46,065 --> 00:03:47,525
Did you get hit in the head?

48
00:03:48,443 --> 00:03:50,194
Stop it right now,
stop it, stop it.!

49
00:03:51,487 --> 00:03:52,905
Uh-oh, it's the coach.

50
00:03:54,407 --> 00:03:56,033
What are you guys doin'
out here anyway?

51
00:03:57,785 --> 00:03:59,161
Steve, I'm surprised at you.

52
00:03:59,162 --> 00:04:00,829
You know better than this, boy.

53
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,623
We're only havin'
a little fun anyhow.

54
00:04:03,124 --> 00:04:04,916
On the eve of our first game.

55
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:06,168
You could get hurt.

56
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:07,544
Then what am I gonna do?

57
00:04:07,545 --> 00:04:09,588
Him get hurt.
What about me?

58
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:11,757
I just got balled
in the back of the head.

59
00:04:11,758 --> 00:04:12,466
(giggling)

60
00:04:12,467 --> 00:04:13,759
Leave it to Debbie.

61
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,720
Ha ha ha ha.

62
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,890
You know it's not allowed
during football season.

63
00:04:19,932 --> 00:04:21,726
I ought to suspend you
right now.

64
00:04:22,101 --> 00:04:23,226
Oh,

65
00:04:23,227 --> 00:04:24,811
don't worry, Coach,
I'll handle it.

66
00:04:24,812 --> 00:04:27,356
I, I won't let it get too,
too much rougher.

67
00:04:27,565 --> 00:04:29,357
Why don't you go home and relax.

68
00:04:29,358 --> 00:04:31,401
Go home and watch
some football on TV.

69
00:04:31,402 --> 00:04:35,405
Yeah, take out your frustrations
on the TV, boob.

70
00:04:35,406 --> 00:04:37,032
Someone call my name?

71
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:38,033
Oh, no.

72
00:04:38,034 --> 00:04:39,326
We got the ball.

73
00:04:39,327 --> 00:04:40,703
Let's go.

74
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:50,713
All right.

75
00:04:53,841 --> 00:04:55,092
Surf's up!

76
00:05:01,724 --> 00:05:02,975
Did you see that?

77
00:05:03,434 --> 00:05:06,395
My entire team is gonna get
wrecked up by a bunch of...

78
00:05:06,813 --> 00:05:08,105
cheerleaders!

79
00:05:09,524 --> 00:05:11,818
Sacked another quarterback.
- Ha ha ha.

80
00:05:11,943 --> 00:05:13,527
In front of the coach?

81
00:05:13,528 --> 00:05:16,947
Not in the sack, Deb, but set sacked!
You know?

82
00:05:16,948 --> 00:05:18,533
I don't get it.

83
00:05:18,574 --> 00:05:20,659
If you don't, none of us do.

84
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,161
All for one.
- And one for all.

85
00:05:23,913 --> 00:05:25,205
Ah, no.

86
00:05:25,206 --> 00:05:26,582
Is that beer they're drinking?

87
00:05:28,668 --> 00:05:31,002
Oh, no, not, not most likely.

88
00:05:31,003 --> 00:05:32,629
That's root beer.

89
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,257
They're good kids coach.

90
00:05:34,674 --> 00:05:35,883
Stevie.

91
00:05:36,092 --> 00:05:37,218
All right.

92
00:05:38,886 --> 00:05:40,763
Don't zap your strength, son.

93
00:05:41,931 --> 00:05:43,808
Remember your precious
bodily fluids.

94
00:05:44,058 --> 00:05:45,768
Keep everything clean.

95
00:05:46,143 --> 00:05:48,271
Remember, we're playing football
tomorrow.

96
00:05:55,736 --> 00:05:57,237
Hey, Chris, catch.

97
00:05:57,238 --> 00:05:58,072
No.

98
00:05:58,406 --> 00:05:59,574
Where's Patti?

99
00:06:01,826 --> 00:06:03,703
That's her over there I think.

100
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:11,002
Hi, Patti, what are you doing?

101
00:06:11,294 --> 00:06:12,545
Just thinking.

102
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,421
About what?

103
00:06:13,963 --> 00:06:15,089
I don't know.

104
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:17,717
Somehow I feel like something's
going to happen.

105
00:06:17,842 --> 00:06:19,050
What, huh?

106
00:06:19,051 --> 00:06:20,970
Hey, what's a matter with Patti?

107
00:06:21,137 --> 00:06:22,513
Nothin', she's thinkin'.

108
00:06:22,597 --> 00:06:24,557
Why would anyone
wanna to do that?

109
00:06:24,807 --> 00:06:26,976
Maybe she's some kind of prophet
or something.

110
00:06:27,059 --> 00:06:29,395
We learned all about that
in economics.

111
00:06:29,645 --> 00:06:31,814
Business really likes profits.

112
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:34,567
No, not profits, a prophet.

113
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,986
Forget it, why don't we
go practice our routines.

114
00:06:37,612 --> 00:06:39,988
Stevie!

115
00:06:39,989 --> 00:06:42,116
Looks like Debbie's already up
to her routine.

116
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:51,083
I don't know how that girl
has any energy left for cheering.

117
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,668
I'm amazed she's got energy
for walking.

118
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:56,671
I'm amazed she's got any energy
left for breathing.

119
00:06:56,672 --> 00:06:59,008
She must take vitamins
or something.

120
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,134
Hey, let's go help Miss Johnson
with coach.

121
00:07:01,135 --> 00:07:02,303
Okay.

122
00:07:03,763 --> 00:07:05,348
Where's Stevie?

123
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,600
He's getting a little energy
from Debbie.

124
00:07:07,683 --> 00:07:08,808
Oh my God.

125
00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:10,018
Where, where is he?

126
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:11,479
Better check the bushes.

127
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:13,481
Wait.

128
00:07:13,648 --> 00:07:14,565
Woo-hoo!

129
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:16,232
Stevie!

130
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:17,734
That's not aloud!

131
00:07:17,735 --> 00:07:19,862
We're playing football
tomorrow night.

132
00:07:20,404 --> 00:07:21,864
I'm leaving Miss Johnson.

133
00:07:22,531 --> 00:07:24,283
I can't take much more of this.

134
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,951
I think that's a good idea.

135
00:07:25,952 --> 00:07:27,912
Don't worry, everything's
in my hands.

136
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:29,705
Please...

137
00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:31,374
don't remind me.

138
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,766
What are you creeps doin' here?

139
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,102
Didn't you know this is
a private party?

140
00:07:51,143 --> 00:07:52,143
Oh yeah?

141
00:07:52,144 --> 00:07:55,146
Well this happens to be
a public beach.

142
00:07:55,147 --> 00:07:57,274
Yeah, but we're telling you guys
to get lost.

143
00:07:57,441 --> 00:07:59,402
You and who's army?

144
00:08:01,737 --> 00:08:04,323
Just make sure you guys don't
cross over that line.

145
00:08:05,157 --> 00:08:09,120
Oh yeah, well we're
really scared.

146
00:08:09,286 --> 00:08:10,538
Oh, yeah?

147
00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:12,539
And what are you gonna do?

148
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,999
We'll sic Debbie on ya.

149
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,877
She'll make sure you're in
no shape for tomorrow's game.

150
00:08:17,503 --> 00:08:18,586
Well forget it.

151
00:08:18,587 --> 00:08:20,381
Even I got my pride you know.

152
00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:27,971
Get out of the way,
break it up you guys!

153
00:08:27,972 --> 00:08:29,765
Now I promised the coach
there'd be no rough-housing.

154
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:31,808
Yeah, but these creeps think
they can come in here

155
00:08:31,809 --> 00:08:33,184
and horn in on our beach.

156
00:08:33,185 --> 00:08:35,603
But you creeps think you own
the whole darn beach.

157
00:08:35,604 --> 00:08:37,689
Wait till tomorrow.
We're gonna cream you.

158
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,524
Yeah.

159
00:08:38,983 --> 00:08:41,944
Uh-oh, I can see we're gonna
have to settle this somehow.

160
00:08:43,112 --> 00:08:45,364
Why don't you do it like
when I was in school.

161
00:08:45,573 --> 00:08:49,577
I don't think we'll find
any dinosaurs to race.

162
00:08:49,994 --> 00:08:53,956
Not dinosaurs, chicken.

163
00:08:53,998 --> 00:08:55,332
I mean chickens.

164
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,459
Okay, once and for all.

165
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,503
My car against yours.

166
00:08:59,628 --> 00:09:01,714
But, I've got a new Cadillac.

167
00:09:01,797 --> 00:09:05,468
You've only got a 53' Plymouth.

168
00:09:06,052 --> 00:09:06,843
So.

169
00:09:06,844 --> 00:09:07,636
So.
- Yeah.

170
00:09:09,346 --> 00:09:11,556
No, I'm talking about chicken.

171
00:09:11,557 --> 00:09:13,683
You know like when the girl
sits on the guys shoulders

172
00:09:13,684 --> 00:09:15,686
and you go around in circles.

173
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,103
On the shoulders.

174
00:09:17,104 --> 00:09:18,647
That even a new one for me.

175
00:09:18,898 --> 00:09:20,858
Not chicken, chicken fight.

176
00:09:20,983 --> 00:09:22,902
Miss Johnson's talking
about chicken fight.

177
00:09:23,027 --> 00:09:24,695
Yeah, chicken.

178
00:09:25,196 --> 00:09:28,491
And if the kids from Baker win,
then they get to stay

179
00:09:28,783 --> 00:09:31,327
and if the kids from Benedict
win, you guys have to go.

180
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,414
A battle for the beach!
(yelling and screaming)

181
00:09:42,546 --> 00:09:44,131
Pull her hair!

182
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,523
(cheering loudly)

183
00:10:21,168 --> 00:10:26,173
You know, I think it's time we
payed Benedict a little visit.

184
00:10:26,632 --> 00:10:29,051
We'll see who wipes who.

185
00:10:29,385 --> 00:10:32,930
Come back, all's forgiven,
come back!

186
00:10:33,013 --> 00:10:35,723
We're gonna tee-pee
their school.

187
00:10:35,724 --> 00:10:37,142
Yeah.
- Right.

188
00:10:37,143 --> 00:10:38,435
All right.

189
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:43,774
(ominous music)

190
00:10:46,277 --> 00:10:49,154
Great Prince of Darkness,

191
00:10:49,155 --> 00:10:51,532
your worshipers call upon you
once more.

192
00:10:53,242 --> 00:10:54,660
Hear their call.

193
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:57,871
Deliver into my hands,

194
00:10:57,872 --> 00:11:00,583
those who make fun of me
and laugh at me.

195
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:04,252
Grant them, that those
who mock and torment

196
00:11:04,253 --> 00:11:05,921
your faithful servant here,

197
00:11:06,297 --> 00:11:08,007
shall be punished.

198
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:10,801
Drink of the blood of darkness.

199
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,014
Darn kids makin' work.

200
00:12:04,772 --> 00:12:08,776
One, two, push em' back,
push em' back, way back.

201
00:12:08,817 --> 00:12:16,817
Push em' back, push em' back,
way back.

202
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,663
I can't do this.
Let's do it right.

203
00:12:21,664 --> 00:12:24,999
One, two, push em' back,
push em' back, way back.

204
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,795
Push em' back, push em' back,
way back.

205
00:12:28,087 --> 00:12:30,923
Push em' back, push em' back,
way back.

206
00:12:31,632 --> 00:12:34,301
Push em' back, push em' back,
way back.

207
00:12:34,969 --> 00:12:37,471
Push em' back, push em' back,
way back.

208
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,640
Push em' back, push em' back,
way back.

209
00:12:40,641 --> 00:12:42,518
Ha ha ha ha.

210
00:12:48,023 --> 00:12:52,027
Ah, look, the big tough
football hero fell down.

211
00:12:52,528 --> 00:12:54,404
Hoping to score?

212
00:12:54,405 --> 00:12:55,863
Ha ha ha ha.

213
00:12:55,864 --> 00:12:57,865
Help, help, I can't get up.
- Come on.

214
00:12:57,866 --> 00:12:59,201
(screaming)

215
00:12:59,618 --> 00:13:01,829
Let go of me you big ape.

216
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,538
I can't help it.

217
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:05,331
I'm wild about your
backfield in motion.

218
00:13:05,332 --> 00:13:06,375
(screaming)

219
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,544
Somebody help me!

220
00:13:08,794 --> 00:13:10,504
One of our cheerleaders
is in trouble.

221
00:13:10,546 --> 00:13:12,130
Oh!

222
00:13:12,131 --> 00:13:14,132
All for one and one for all.

223
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:16,343
Huskie cheerleaders have a ball.

224
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:18,052
Hey!
(screaming and laughing)

225
00:13:18,053 --> 00:13:20,805
Hey, you get the other leg.

226
00:13:20,806 --> 00:13:22,224
Wait a minute.

227
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:23,684
Hey, knock it off.

228
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:25,643
You're not being the hero I am.

229
00:13:25,644 --> 00:13:26,519
That's true.

230
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,603
He does score more than anyone else.

231
00:13:27,604 --> 00:13:28,896
Uh-hmm

232
00:13:28,897 --> 00:13:30,523
But besides, the coach doesn't
like us messing around

233
00:13:30,524 --> 00:13:32,192
during the season.

234
00:13:32,234 --> 00:13:34,444
Terrific, we're ready
to throw a pass

235
00:13:34,445 --> 00:13:37,156
and we end up with a guy
who can't even catch the ball.

236
00:13:37,656 --> 00:13:39,074
Hey, what's going on here?

237
00:13:39,158 --> 00:13:40,826
What, what do you think
you're doing?

238
00:13:41,118 --> 00:13:41,993
We're having an orgy.

239
00:13:41,994 --> 00:13:43,036
What's it to you?

240
00:13:43,037 --> 00:13:44,538
Wanna join the fun?

241
00:13:45,414 --> 00:13:47,666
Well, I'm gonna tell the coach
about this.

242
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,793
Ah.
- Oh, man!

243
00:13:52,504 --> 00:13:53,672
You'd do that man.

244
00:13:54,423 --> 00:13:56,216
Without me, runnin' the ball,
he's got no job.

245
00:13:56,425 --> 00:13:58,259
Without Stevie, no team.

246
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,927
Without the team, no game.

247
00:13:59,928 --> 00:14:01,764
Without the game, no cheers.

248
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:04,933
And without the cheers, no us.

249
00:14:05,434 --> 00:14:07,770
Without these girls, there'd be
no one for you to gawk at.

250
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,355
You all think your so smart,
don't you?

251
00:14:10,356 --> 00:14:11,522
Well, you ain't.

252
00:14:11,523 --> 00:14:13,816
You ain't so...
damn smart after all!

253
00:14:13,817 --> 00:14:15,610
You just w-w-wait and see!

254
00:14:15,611 --> 00:14:17,988
Ha ha ha ha.

255
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,585
Good morning, Mr. Brooks.
Cheery day, isn't it?

256
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,097
Hi.
- Hi, chief, how you doin'?

257
00:14:43,263 --> 00:14:44,847
Good morning, everybody.

258
00:14:44,848 --> 00:14:46,100
Cheery day, isn't it?

259
00:14:46,141 --> 00:14:47,600
Hi, Miss Johnson.

260
00:14:47,601 --> 00:14:49,853
Uh, no, it's Ms., uh, Johnson.
Right, girls?

261
00:14:50,312 --> 00:14:51,105
On it

262
00:14:51,397 --> 00:14:52,981
You mean, right on.

263
00:14:53,148 --> 00:14:54,733
Yeah, that's what I said.
Right on.

264
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,945
Oh, my goodness.

265
00:14:58,362 --> 00:14:59,988
We've been tee-peed.

266
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:04,992
Oh my, here comes trouble.

267
00:15:04,993 --> 00:15:07,036
It's those rich kids
from Baker High.

268
00:15:07,037 --> 00:15:08,914
Let's get em'!

269
00:15:09,748 --> 00:15:11,750
Oh, I don't know you guys.

270
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:14,336
Tee-pee us, will you?

271
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,671
Yeah!

272
00:15:16,672 --> 00:15:18,507
Yeah, you guys, go!

273
00:15:18,882 --> 00:15:21,176
(horn honking)

274
00:15:24,096 --> 00:15:28,100
(screaming and yelling)

275
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,040
(whistle blowing)

276
00:16:33,457 --> 00:16:34,833
Oh, darn.

277
00:16:36,502 --> 00:16:41,297
Oh.
- Oh.

278
00:16:41,298 --> 00:16:42,173
(laughing)

279
00:16:42,174 --> 00:16:44,342
Oh, dear, ah.

280
00:16:44,343 --> 00:16:46,094
Stevie, I'm surprised at you.

281
00:16:48,347 --> 00:16:51,265
Uh, disciplinary action
shall be taken, uh, Dean.

282
00:16:51,266 --> 00:16:52,433
I assure you.

283
00:16:52,434 --> 00:16:55,019
I-I'm afraid this is
all my fault, Coach.

284
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,022
No it's not!
(yelling)

285
00:16:58,023 --> 00:17:00,025
Knock it off!

286
00:17:00,442 --> 00:17:02,443
I'm here to make men Ms. Johnson

287
00:17:02,444 --> 00:17:04,362
and when it comes to making men!

288
00:17:04,363 --> 00:17:07,366
You can't beat a cheerleader.
Ha ha ha ha.

289
00:17:08,408 --> 00:17:09,742
I'll have all this cleaned up.

290
00:17:09,743 --> 00:17:11,453
They-they really didn't
mean any harm.

291
00:17:12,246 --> 00:17:14,331
Discipline is a fact of life
they've all got to learn.

292
00:17:15,624 --> 00:17:17,876
Steven and the others
are suspended.

293
00:17:18,001 --> 00:17:21,296
(murmuring)

294
00:17:22,172 --> 00:17:24,216
Dean.
- That's not fair.

295
00:17:25,384 --> 00:17:26,760
Oh.

296
00:17:27,511 --> 00:17:29,721
We didn't do it.
They started it.

297
00:17:32,391 --> 00:17:33,891
Let's go you guys.

298
00:17:33,892 --> 00:17:35,561
What a drag.

299
00:17:38,855 --> 00:17:40,231
Okay, bye.

300
00:17:40,232 --> 00:17:41,942
Whoa.

301
00:17:43,527 --> 00:17:44,653
That's bull.

302
00:17:45,195 --> 00:17:46,487
He's always suspending me

303
00:17:46,488 --> 00:17:47,698
then playing me.

304
00:17:48,156 --> 00:17:50,450
I'm sick of that
Vincent Lombardi cupcake.

305
00:17:51,201 --> 00:17:52,493
Time he learned a lesson.

306
00:17:52,494 --> 00:17:54,370
Well, I don't have time
to straighten this out now.

307
00:17:54,371 --> 00:17:56,247
I'll talk to the coach later,
but Stevie,

308
00:17:56,248 --> 00:17:57,999
please don't do
anything foolish.

309
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,959
I won't.

310
00:17:59,543 --> 00:18:01,044
What time are we leaving?

311
00:18:01,253 --> 00:18:03,588
Oh, in about half an hour
if you guys want to get

312
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:05,214
an early start for the game.
If that's okay?

313
00:18:05,215 --> 00:18:06,257
Sure.

314
00:18:06,258 --> 00:18:08,009
Is there a place for us
to change at the game?

315
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,177
Oh, no, I'm afraid not.

316
00:18:10,178 --> 00:18:12,513
You know you guys,
I can remember

317
00:18:12,514 --> 00:18:14,181
when I was leading cheers
for the Huskies,

318
00:18:14,182 --> 00:18:16,226
we once had to change
in the team bus.

319
00:18:16,393 --> 00:18:18,644
That must have been fun
for the team.

320
00:18:18,645 --> 00:18:20,188
Ha ha ha ha.

321
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:23,066
Oh, Stevie, we didn't.

322
00:18:23,108 --> 00:18:24,775
I mean it's okay now, but...

323
00:18:24,776 --> 00:18:27,236
I mean, you know what I mean.
- That's okay, Miss Johnson.

324
00:18:27,237 --> 00:18:29,780
We understand, you didn't,
but you do.

325
00:18:29,781 --> 00:18:30,365
Yeah.

326
00:18:30,574 --> 00:18:32,325
No, that's not really
what I meant.

327
00:18:32,326 --> 00:18:35,244
We know...listen, if we have to
get into our outfits now,

328
00:18:35,245 --> 00:18:37,038
why don't we shower here
before we go.

329
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,498
We're a mess.

330
00:18:38,582 --> 00:18:40,166
Okay, why not?

331
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:42,085
That's a great idea.
I'm sort of sweaty myself.

332
00:18:42,377 --> 00:18:45,756
Stevie...you're in enough
trouble as it is.

333
00:18:45,922 --> 00:18:47,131
Don't worry about it.

334
00:18:47,132 --> 00:18:49,051
We've got a trick play
of our own.

335
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:54,348
Oh...Stevie, you be careful now.
- We will.

336
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,689
I'm sorry you had
to witness that, Dean.

337
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,983
But I do appreciate your
coming down to see

338
00:19:05,984 --> 00:19:07,569
our first game this year.

339
00:19:07,944 --> 00:19:10,946
When I applied for the coaching
job at your university,

340
00:19:10,947 --> 00:19:13,492
I must admit, I had very high
hopes of getting it.

341
00:19:14,034 --> 00:19:16,828
And how nice that
your secretary could join us.

342
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,623
I want you to know, Dean,

343
00:19:20,624 --> 00:19:24,461
I realize that winning
is important, but...

344
00:19:25,504 --> 00:19:26,505
it's not everything.

345
00:19:28,131 --> 00:19:31,134
After all, your university
is a religious school

346
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,969
and I always tell my boys

347
00:19:33,345 --> 00:19:36,348
God...is number one.

348
00:19:38,892 --> 00:19:39,643
Dammit.

349
00:19:40,977 --> 00:19:42,270
Sorry

350
00:19:46,358 --> 00:19:50,028
Well, I'm pretty sure that...you're
going to enjoy something here.

351
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:52,780
(musici)
I see you're gettin' ready

352
00:19:52,781 --> 00:19:55,951
shinin' up my Chevy,
my dream.

353
00:19:58,286 --> 00:20:02,289
I love to see you movin' and
I want you groovin'

354
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,835
together with me

355
00:20:06,211 --> 00:20:10,215
So who you gonna love tonight

356
00:20:10,424 --> 00:20:14,427
Won't you make it me this time

357
00:20:14,428 --> 00:20:17,596
Who you gonna love tonight

358
00:20:17,597 --> 00:20:20,015
That Billy character really
gives me the creeps.

359
00:20:20,016 --> 00:20:23,186
Yeah, just the way he looks
at me, I feel so dirty.

360
00:20:23,979 --> 00:20:27,648
Now girls...it's not nice
to talk badly about people.

361
00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:29,609
Mr Brooks is only doing his job,
that's all.

362
00:20:31,153 --> 00:20:33,363
Well, I don't want him
anywhere near me,

363
00:20:33,447 --> 00:20:35,490
not if he were
the last toad on earth

364
00:20:35,782 --> 00:20:38,743
Toad? ... I thought we were
talking about Mr. Brooks?

365
00:20:38,744 --> 00:20:40,829
(laughter)

366
00:20:41,121 --> 00:20:42,748
Live and let live,
right Miss J?

367
00:20:43,248 --> 00:20:45,125
Right on, Patty.

368
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:50,797
(Satanic chant)
Blessed be

369
00:20:51,173 --> 00:20:55,177
(music continues)

370
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:54,861
(girls laughing)

371
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:59,866
That's why I grabbed, Chris, right?

372
00:22:00,367 --> 00:22:03,036
He meant to grab me,
Chris just got in the way.

373
00:22:03,203 --> 00:22:07,206
If you ask me that whole team is
in need of one long cold shower.

374
00:22:07,207 --> 00:22:08,458
(laughter)

375
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,502
And I'm just the one who's
gonna give it to them

376
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,380
Stevie'd tackle anything
that bounced past him.

377
00:22:13,421 --> 00:22:15,798
You know what I mean.
- You bet he would.

378
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:17,801
(laughter)

379
00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:22,305
Oh, ya.
(laughter)

380
00:22:23,807 --> 00:22:26,725
Better hurry, girls, we don't
want to be late for our first

381
00:22:26,726 --> 00:22:29,104
big game, oh besides,
I have to stop and get gas.

382
00:22:29,145 --> 00:22:34,943
Gonna give 'em gas,
gonna give 'em gas,

383
00:22:34,985 --> 00:22:37,237
Then we'll kick 'em in the ass,
kick 'em in the ass.

384
00:22:38,154 --> 00:22:42,157
I don't remember that cheer.
(laughter)

385
00:22:42,158 --> 00:22:44,077
This'll fix that super coach.

386
00:22:46,872 --> 00:22:48,665
Let's go!

387
00:22:51,293 --> 00:22:53,587
Come on, let's go.
..Come on, let's go.

388
00:23:01,803 --> 00:23:03,430
Hurry up, girls.

389
00:23:09,769 --> 00:23:13,773
When I...that is, if...
I become your university's coach

390
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:17,484
I can handle those boys.

391
00:23:17,485 --> 00:23:20,906
One thing I insist on, now,
you may think this foolish.

392
00:23:21,489 --> 00:23:23,407
But cleanliness...

393
00:23:23,408 --> 00:23:27,412
A clean body, a clean mind,

394
00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:29,580
A clean boy.

395
00:23:29,581 --> 00:23:31,540
Cleanliness.

396
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:34,209
And we know what that's next to.

397
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,921
Cleanliness.

398
00:23:36,922 --> 00:23:39,716
I make my boys keep
a spotless locker room.

399
00:23:40,091 --> 00:23:42,052
I think you'd be impressed.

400
00:23:43,678 --> 00:23:46,264
It's alright, there's nobody in here.

401
00:23:50,685 --> 00:23:53,229
I - I - I don't understand
- Coach!

402
00:23:53,313 --> 00:23:56,357
The - the door, I mean, you know
- Hey look who's here!

403
00:23:56,358 --> 00:23:59,109
You gotta understand, the -
the sign on the door

404
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,278
Wanna show us some
new plays, coach

405
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,863
Is this what you call
an "end run"?

406
00:24:02,864 --> 00:24:06,868
I mean, look, uh...that's...
OH...

407
00:24:08,078 --> 00:24:10,705
It's alright, boys will be boys.

408
00:24:11,289 --> 00:24:14,084
I don't know,
- Say cheese!

409
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:16,461
What the Hell!?

410
00:24:16,586 --> 00:24:18,170
Wait until I get my hands
on that boy!

411
00:24:18,171 --> 00:24:19,964
That's my job, coach.

412
00:24:19,965 --> 00:24:21,840
Don't worry,
I'll straighten him out.

413
00:24:21,841 --> 00:24:25,011
(laughter)

414
00:24:25,136 --> 00:24:29,140
So long...bye bye.
(laughter)

415
00:24:32,978 --> 00:24:34,104
See ya

416
00:24:35,355 --> 00:24:36,189
Bye

417
00:24:37,148 --> 00:24:38,566
Hello
(laughter)

418
00:24:39,109 --> 00:24:40,485
Hello
(laughter)

419
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:46,574
(music)

420
00:25:06,136 --> 00:25:08,470
I told you we'd
find her down here.

421
00:25:08,471 --> 00:25:09,763
Making out as usual.

422
00:25:09,764 --> 00:25:12,016
Not a bad technique
for a football player.

423
00:25:12,017 --> 00:25:14,309
(laughter)

424
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,894
Oh, there you are, Debbie.

425
00:25:15,895 --> 00:25:17,521
We've got to get going

426
00:25:17,522 --> 00:25:19,356
And Stevie, I sure hope
the coach let's you play.

427
00:25:19,357 --> 00:25:21,567
Oh, he's playin' alright.

428
00:25:21,568 --> 00:25:24,446
And uh, scoring a little bit,
too, eh Stevie?

429
00:25:24,696 --> 00:25:28,700
I'll play...and play and play
and play

430
00:25:30,452 --> 00:25:34,456
(music)

431
00:25:43,673 --> 00:25:46,925
You know, I can remember the fun
of going to our opening game

432
00:25:46,926 --> 00:25:49,470
I can just imagine how
thrilled you guys must be.

433
00:25:49,471 --> 00:25:51,180
There is something thrilling
about the first game

434
00:25:51,181 --> 00:25:52,139
of the season

435
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,559
Half the guys are watching us
instead of the action on the field

436
00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:58,396
Are you kidding? We do our jobs,
why we are the action!

437
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,106
One of these days the coaches
will get hip enough to let us

438
00:26:01,107 --> 00:26:03,859
perform on the field and let
the guys cheer from the side.

439
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,985
For sure!

440
00:26:04,986 --> 00:26:08,281
Right on!
Woohoo!

441
00:26:09,783 --> 00:26:13,787
(music continues)

442
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:00,125
Hey, what are you?
Some kind of a thief?

443
00:27:01,459 --> 00:27:03,294
No, wait a minute, I get it

444
00:27:04,212 --> 00:27:06,422
Billy boy here's no thief,
he's a pre-vert.

445
00:27:06,923 --> 00:27:09,509
Those clothes turn you on,
Billy boy?

446
00:27:10,593 --> 00:27:12,846
Get out of here!
All of you!

447
00:27:13,138 --> 00:27:14,680
Sure, we'll get out, Billy boy.

448
00:27:14,681 --> 00:27:16,306
But you've had it.

449
00:27:16,307 --> 00:27:18,685
We can't have someone like you
around these young girls.

450
00:27:19,477 --> 00:27:20,311
Pre-vert

451
00:27:31,281 --> 00:27:33,783
That janitor character
gives me the creeps.

452
00:27:34,117 --> 00:27:37,078
El Creepo.
- He's okay

453
00:27:37,328 --> 00:27:40,165
Mr Brooks has a very difficult
job to do you guys

454
00:27:40,456 --> 00:27:42,541
He is always looking
and hanging around us

455
00:27:42,542 --> 00:27:44,793
you can't deny that.
- No, no way

456
00:27:44,794 --> 00:27:46,170
You know a lot of the other
cheerleader groups

457
00:27:46,171 --> 00:27:47,505
have felt like you guys.

458
00:27:48,006 --> 00:27:50,258
Maybe I should...
give him a little time

459
00:27:50,425 --> 00:27:52,384
(laughter)
Oh, that would be nice.

460
00:27:52,385 --> 00:27:54,137
He probably just needs
someone to talk to.

461
00:27:54,387 --> 00:27:56,014
She's not talking about talking

462
00:27:56,431 --> 00:27:58,599
Deb, you're too much,
you'd wipe that old man out

463
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,766
the first time around.

464
00:27:59,767 --> 00:28:02,187
One for all...
- All for one!

465
00:28:11,905 --> 00:28:15,909
Woohoo!

466
00:28:17,702 --> 00:28:21,706
(Satanic chant)

467
00:28:23,249 --> 00:28:25,835
Woohoo!

468
00:28:26,544 --> 00:28:30,548
(Satanic Chant)

469
00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:45,313
(screams)

470
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,903
What the hell happened?

471
00:28:52,904 --> 00:28:55,489
Do you see that?!

472
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:57,324
That sure was close!

473
00:28:57,325 --> 00:28:58,909
That could have killed us!

474
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,661
I'm sure they didn't
mean us any harm.

475
00:29:00,662 --> 00:29:01,788
I'm glad you're sure.

476
00:29:02,288 --> 00:29:03,498
Is everybody okay?

477
00:29:03,706 --> 00:29:04,748
Nobody's hurt, but...

478
00:29:04,749 --> 00:29:07,669
this seat sure feels
a little wet back here, Debbie.

479
00:29:08,044 --> 00:29:10,003
Is somebody bleeding?!
- (laughing)

480
00:29:10,004 --> 00:29:11,839
No, everybody's okay.

481
00:29:17,053 --> 00:29:18,638
Oh, darnit!

482
00:29:26,521 --> 00:29:28,898
I wonder how you open this.
- I don't know.

483
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,150
Now there's a motor in there,
I'm sure of it.

484
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:33,610
Yup, there's gotta be
a motor in here.

485
00:29:33,611 --> 00:29:36,114
No question about it, I know
there's a motor in there.

486
00:29:36,281 --> 00:29:37,573
If you say so.

487
00:29:37,615 --> 00:29:39,284
I guess there's a
motor in there.

488
00:29:39,784 --> 00:29:41,410
I wonder where they went?

489
00:29:41,411 --> 00:29:42,911
Why don't you just
go find them Deb

490
00:29:42,912 --> 00:29:45,163
Those boys from Baker just
change their minds

491
00:29:45,164 --> 00:29:46,665
about Stevie being so good.

492
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:48,918
Hey let's hitchhike you guys!
We still might make the game!

493
00:29:49,002 --> 00:29:50,460
Yeah! Lets go!

494
00:29:50,461 --> 00:29:52,045
We'll have no problem
picking up a ride.

495
00:29:52,046 --> 00:29:54,214
Ohhh. I don't know you guys.

496
00:29:54,215 --> 00:29:55,925
Hitchhiking can be dangerous.

497
00:29:56,009 --> 00:29:57,635
Awe, don't worry about it.

498
00:29:57,677 --> 00:29:58,802
Why don't you just
go get our stuff?

499
00:29:58,803 --> 00:30:00,013
Yeah! Come on!

500
00:30:02,807 --> 00:30:04,392
Be careful!

501
00:30:06,853 --> 00:30:08,604
God, I wonder if anybody
is going to come?

502
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,690
Awe man! This road is deserted!

503
00:30:12,608 --> 00:30:14,610
Oh look!
Here comes somebody!

504
00:30:16,154 --> 00:30:18,740
That's alright girls.
Just watch this number.

505
00:30:22,327 --> 00:30:23,953
You call that a number, huh?

506
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,371
Baby, that went out the
second they chose Playboy.

507
00:30:26,372 --> 00:30:27,790
Dig this!

508
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:30,500
(Laughter)

509
00:30:30,501 --> 00:30:33,254
You guys! Now stop the clowning!

510
00:30:33,379 --> 00:30:34,964
Okay

511
00:30:37,216 --> 00:30:39,802
I think I see Mr. Brooks coming!

512
00:30:40,303 --> 00:30:42,513
Awe...

513
00:30:44,974 --> 00:30:46,934
Laughter

514
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,117
High girls! I see You..

515
00:31:04,118 --> 00:31:05,870
You had some trouble
with you car, huh?

516
00:31:06,245 --> 00:31:07,914
Well get in! I'll give you a ride.

517
00:31:07,955 --> 00:31:09,415
Oh good!

518
00:31:14,212 --> 00:31:15,546
You better watch it!

519
00:31:15,713 --> 00:31:16,839
This is only the beginning.

520
00:31:17,006 --> 00:31:18,591
You girls think you're so smart

521
00:31:18,716 --> 00:31:20,760
You've been asking for it
and now you're going to get it!

522
00:31:20,927 --> 00:31:22,719
And you're going to be the first

523
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,389
What do you mean first?

524
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:26,099
You'll find out.

525
00:31:27,183 --> 00:31:28,683
What'd he do to you?

526
00:31:28,684 --> 00:31:29,768
He grabbed you, didn't he?

527
00:31:29,769 --> 00:31:30,728
Yeah!

528
00:31:30,853 --> 00:31:32,354
That's what the
excitement's all about?

529
00:31:32,355 --> 00:31:33,731
Big deal.

530
00:31:41,489 --> 00:31:42,739
What went on back there?

531
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,201
I know those girls can
be a handful sometimes.

532
00:31:45,326 --> 00:31:47,619
Ha ha ha
Handful!

533
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:51,624
Yup! That's what I did!
I got me a handful!

534
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:53,875
What do you mean? Handful?

535
00:31:53,876 --> 00:31:56,294
(Laughter continues)

536
00:31:56,295 --> 00:31:57,546
What are you doing?!

537
00:31:57,547 --> 00:31:58,840
This isn't the way to Baker?!

538
00:31:59,006 --> 00:32:01,384
I'm just taking a little detour!

539
00:32:01,592 --> 00:32:02,467
Detour?

540
00:32:02,468 --> 00:32:04,011
No we have to go to Baker.

541
00:32:04,178 --> 00:32:05,430
Never mind that.

542
00:32:05,471 --> 00:32:06,889
I'm the boss now!

543
00:32:07,682 --> 00:32:08,766
Stop this car!

544
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,726
Stop this car
instantly, Mr. Brooks

545
00:32:11,018 --> 00:32:13,103
We can get along
just fine without you.

546
00:32:13,104 --> 00:32:16,065
Now, now I'm here to
protect those girls.

547
00:32:16,357 --> 00:32:19,152
I'll tell the principle
if you don't!

548
00:32:20,111 --> 00:32:22,696
Now stop this car instantly, please!

549
00:32:22,697 --> 00:32:24,866
This here's not a car! It's a pickup!

550
00:32:25,032 --> 00:32:26,992
And I just picked me
up some Cheerleaders

551
00:32:26,993 --> 00:32:28,327
get whats coming to them!

552
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:31,080
Have you gone completely mad?

553
00:32:31,706 --> 00:32:34,374
Now Mr. Brooks, we can
just do fine without you.

554
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:36,419
We'll walk. Now stop the car!

555
00:32:36,461 --> 00:32:38,086
Never mind that!

556
00:32:38,087 --> 00:32:39,714
I don't think you get my meaning.

557
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:42,924
I'm gonna take you girls

558
00:32:42,925 --> 00:32:45,094
and we're going to
have some fun!

559
00:32:45,595 --> 00:32:47,513
And there ain’t nothing
you can do about it!

560
00:32:47,805 --> 00:32:48,889
Ha ha ha!

561
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:50,098
He he he!

562
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:52,101
You've gone crazy!

563
00:32:53,811 --> 00:32:55,729
Stop!

564
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,522
Stop this car instantly!

565
00:32:57,523 --> 00:32:59,441
I can't!

566
00:32:59,442 --> 00:33:01,026
Oh my god!

567
00:33:01,027 --> 00:33:05,031
(Screaming)

568
00:33:25,885 --> 00:33:27,762
Lets go see what's
the matter with him!

569
00:33:28,221 --> 00:33:31,766
What a jerk!

570
00:33:37,897 --> 00:33:39,105
Are you alright Mrs. Johnson?

571
00:33:39,106 --> 00:33:40,774
Yes! Is everybody else okay?

572
00:33:40,775 --> 00:33:42,067
You might have killed us!

573
00:33:42,068 --> 00:33:43,568
Wake up creep! You've got
some explaining to do!

574
00:33:43,569 --> 00:33:45,111
Stop it! Stop it!

575
00:33:45,112 --> 00:33:46,656
Don't you do that to me!

576
00:33:46,739 --> 00:33:48,032
Shut up all of you!

577
00:33:48,074 --> 00:33:49,534
You're in my power!

578
00:33:49,575 --> 00:33:51,118
And you'll do as I say.

579
00:33:51,577 --> 00:33:53,371
We're in you power?

580
00:33:53,496 --> 00:33:54,372
Ha!

581
00:33:54,622 --> 00:33:56,999
Take me! I'm in you power...

582
00:33:57,041 --> 00:33:58,458
I'm yours...

583
00:33:58,459 --> 00:33:59,876
ha ha!

584
00:33:59,877 --> 00:34:01,253
It's cold here.

585
00:34:01,254 --> 00:34:02,546
This place is weird.

586
00:34:02,547 --> 00:34:03,505
Look!

587
00:34:03,506 --> 00:34:04,715
Look over there.

588
00:34:05,341 --> 00:34:06,801
What's that?

589
00:34:07,009 --> 00:34:08,885
I look positively ruined!

590
00:34:08,886 --> 00:34:10,763
Just look at this face.

591
00:34:52,555 --> 00:34:55,516
(Satanic chants) Blessed be

592
00:34:59,186 --> 00:35:03,190
(Group Chanting)

593
00:35:19,206 --> 00:35:21,334
You promised! She's mine!

594
00:35:21,917 --> 00:35:23,085
You promised!

595
00:35:23,753 --> 00:35:25,170
You promised her to me!

596
00:35:25,171 --> 00:35:26,255
She's mine!

597
00:35:58,829 --> 00:36:00,748
(Chanting stops)

598
00:36:09,006 --> 00:36:10,298
Patti! What happened?

599
00:36:10,299 --> 00:36:11,841
What are you doing
with your clothes off?

600
00:36:11,842 --> 00:36:12,884
Are you alright?

601
00:36:12,885 --> 00:36:14,178
Did he hurt you?

602
00:36:15,763 --> 00:36:17,597
Look! Look! It's Billy!

603
00:36:17,598 --> 00:36:19,767
Oh my god.

604
00:36:20,851 --> 00:36:22,143
He looks...

605
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,437
is...

606
00:36:23,604 --> 00:36:24,855
He's dead.

607
00:36:25,314 --> 00:36:26,857
I don't understand?

608
00:36:27,441 --> 00:36:29,193
Did any of you see
what happened?

609
00:36:30,152 --> 00:36:32,320
I just remember that crazy ride

610
00:36:32,321 --> 00:36:33,864
and we came here...

611
00:36:34,365 --> 00:36:35,491
And then...

612
00:36:35,783 --> 00:36:37,117
Me too. And then...

613
00:36:37,118 --> 00:36:38,535
Nothing.

614
00:36:38,536 --> 00:36:41,622
I remember cold, cold wind.

615
00:36:42,081 --> 00:36:43,540
Lets get out of here!

616
00:36:43,541 --> 00:36:44,625
Yeah.

617
00:36:45,835 --> 00:36:49,755
It's alright now. It's all over.

618
00:36:50,047 --> 00:36:51,716
It's all over?

619
00:36:52,341 --> 00:36:54,676
How did he die, Pati?

620
00:36:54,677 --> 00:36:56,053
He tried to rape me.

621
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:58,097
It must have been
a heart attack.

622
00:36:58,806 --> 00:37:01,600
God! That man just
went completely mad!

623
00:37:01,684 --> 00:37:02,684
Come on!

624
00:37:02,685 --> 00:37:04,937
Lets get out of here.
Lets go.

625
00:37:30,588 --> 00:37:32,548
Come on girls.
Everything will be alright.

626
00:37:32,673 --> 00:37:34,759
Don't worry.
You're going to be okay

627
00:37:38,304 --> 00:37:39,889
Get inside girls!

628
00:37:40,097 --> 00:37:42,432
Okay. Lets go you guys.
Pati you sit in the front.

629
00:37:42,433 --> 00:37:43,768
Are you okay?

630
00:37:46,687 --> 00:37:47,938
Let's go!

631
00:38:02,161 --> 00:38:03,871
There's someone.
We better ask.

632
00:38:10,795 --> 00:38:11,462
Hey!

633
00:38:11,837 --> 00:38:12,713
Hey you!

634
00:38:13,714 --> 00:38:14,924
Sir!

635
00:38:15,382 --> 00:38:16,967
Hey!

636
00:38:17,593 --> 00:38:19,303
Hey you!

637
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,638
Sir!

638
00:38:23,015 --> 00:38:24,934
What's the matter man? You deaf?

639
00:38:25,267 --> 00:38:27,394
I can hear just fine, thank you!

640
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:30,064
You shouldn't be
making such a racket.

641
00:38:30,356 --> 00:38:33,108
While a man is laboring
under the hot sun

642
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:35,235
We had an accident. We need help!

643
00:38:35,236 --> 00:38:36,820
There's a dead man laying
out there in the woods

644
00:38:36,821 --> 00:38:38,197
we got to get to the sheriff!

645
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,949
Dead man?

646
00:38:40,074 --> 00:38:41,283
What dead man?

647
00:38:42,076 --> 00:38:43,409
Excuse us sir

648
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:45,245
The girls are a bit overwrought.

649
00:38:45,246 --> 00:38:47,289
We've been through
quite a bit of an ordeal

650
00:38:47,414 --> 00:38:48,915
Would you be kind enough to

651
00:38:48,916 --> 00:38:50,375
direct us to the
Sheriff's station?

652
00:38:50,376 --> 00:38:52,336
It's most important that
we make out a report.

653
00:38:52,503 --> 00:38:54,046
I'm working ma'am.

654
00:38:54,213 --> 00:38:56,131
A man stops working to talk

655
00:38:56,173 --> 00:39:00,761
just isn't good economics
if you know what I mean.

656
00:39:01,178 --> 00:39:03,138
No. I'm sorry. I really don't?

657
00:39:03,347 --> 00:39:06,058
It means he wants some bread.
Right Pops?

658
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:08,561
At your service, ladies

659
00:39:10,813 --> 00:39:12,188
Why I never!

660
00:39:12,189 --> 00:39:14,692
Been hungry? I have.

661
00:39:17,736 --> 00:39:19,153
Now would you be kind enough

662
00:39:19,154 --> 00:39:20,822
to direct us to the sheriff's office?

663
00:39:20,823 --> 00:39:22,366
Oh. Sure thing.

664
00:39:22,491 --> 00:39:24,201
Only he hasn't got an office.

665
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,120
Except in his house

666
00:39:26,453 --> 00:39:28,706
Just follow the highway
straight through town

667
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:31,917
Third house on the left after
you pass the city limits

668
00:39:32,585 --> 00:39:34,545
The only sheriff in these mountains.

669
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:38,340
Got a sign out front. could
have saved you a dollar.

670
00:39:38,549 --> 00:39:40,633
Thank you. You've
been most kind sir.

671
00:39:40,634 --> 00:39:42,344
Come on girls! Lets go!

672
00:39:43,053 --> 00:39:44,930
Yeah. Thanks a lot Pop.

673
00:39:47,016 --> 00:39:49,685
Take a picture. It lasts longer!

674
00:39:50,561 --> 00:39:54,356
I was just admiring your outfits.

675
00:39:54,648 --> 00:39:56,357
Little unusual. Ain’t it?

676
00:39:56,358 --> 00:39:57,650
Well these are our
hunting outfits sir.

677
00:39:57,651 --> 00:39:59,153
We always hunt in them.

678
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,321
Hunt?

679
00:40:00,905 --> 00:40:03,073
I'm afraid you're out of season.

680
00:40:03,115 --> 00:40:04,365
No game now.

681
00:40:04,366 --> 00:40:07,201
You haven't been game for
thirty years, have you pops?

682
00:40:07,202 --> 00:40:09,037
(Laughter)

683
00:40:09,038 --> 00:40:10,998
Nothing wrong with
racing his motor a bit.

684
00:40:11,206 --> 00:40:13,082
I don't think his
motor can even start

685
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:14,543
let alone race!

686
00:40:14,585 --> 00:40:16,253
He's breathing right?

687
00:40:16,295 --> 00:40:20,299
(Laughter)

688
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,936
Wow! Talk about a hick town

689
00:41:14,937 --> 00:41:16,938
Think we might
run into Opie and aunt B?

690
00:41:16,939 --> 00:41:18,732
Perfect! What a name!

691
00:41:18,816 --> 00:41:20,234
Sheriff Bub!

692
00:41:20,275 --> 00:41:21,819
(Laughter)

693
00:41:28,492 --> 00:41:29,868
Good afternoon.

694
00:41:30,244 --> 00:41:31,828
Can I be of assistance?

695
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:33,454
Are you sheriff Bub?

696
00:41:33,455 --> 00:41:34,330
Yes ma'am

697
00:41:34,331 --> 00:41:34,790
Bub.

698
00:41:34,999 --> 00:41:36,249
I'm Joan Johnson.

699
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,961
I'm a physical education teacher
at Benedict High and Arnold

700
00:41:40,004 --> 00:41:41,045
We're the Huskies.

701
00:41:41,046 --> 00:41:42,715
I'll second that motion.

702
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:44,133
How do you do?

703
00:41:45,092 --> 00:41:46,844
This is our cheerleading team.

704
00:41:47,344 --> 00:41:49,095
We were on our way
to a game this afternoon

705
00:41:49,096 --> 00:41:50,180
at Baker.

706
00:41:50,347 --> 00:41:51,973
Well, pleased to meet you all.

707
00:41:51,974 --> 00:41:53,391
What can I do to
be of assistance?

708
00:41:53,392 --> 00:41:54,225
I'm at your service.

709
00:41:54,226 --> 00:41:57,770
Well, I'm afraid we've had
kind of a major problem

710
00:41:57,771 --> 00:42:00,232
which might take
a lot of explaining.

711
00:42:00,441 --> 00:42:02,233
Been a rather
trying day for us.

712
00:42:02,234 --> 00:42:04,068
Man that's the
understatement of the year.

713
00:42:04,069 --> 00:42:05,361
I know. You know?

714
00:42:05,362 --> 00:42:07,239
We're never going to
get to that game.

715
00:42:07,614 --> 00:42:09,615
Please girls. I'll handle this.

716
00:42:09,616 --> 00:42:11,367
Wouldn't you like to step inside

717
00:42:11,368 --> 00:42:12,952
I'm sure you'd all like
something cold to drink.

718
00:42:12,953 --> 00:42:15,039
Thank you that would
be most welcome.

719
00:42:17,499 --> 00:42:19,834
Make mine Bourbon and Branch.
Double

720
00:42:19,835 --> 00:42:22,046
Well now you lady.
I'll have to check your ID first.

721
00:42:22,212 --> 00:42:24,380
After all. I represent
the law around here.

722
00:42:24,381 --> 00:42:26,883
And contrary to a
lot of TV and movies

723
00:42:26,884 --> 00:42:29,135
most of us are as
honest as the day is long.

724
00:42:29,136 --> 00:42:29,844
(laughter)

725
00:42:29,845 --> 00:42:31,262
Getting shorter under the sun.

726
00:42:31,263 --> 00:42:33,057
Wow! What a doll!

727
00:42:37,436 --> 00:42:38,603
And you are?

728
00:42:38,604 --> 00:42:39,855
Pati Sexton

729
00:42:43,525 --> 00:42:47,236
I know it's silly of me to keep
going over and over it and

730
00:42:47,237 --> 00:42:48,946
I'm sure the sheriff will find

731
00:42:48,947 --> 00:42:50,948
the evidence just
as we told him.

732
00:42:50,949 --> 00:42:53,827
But I can't help thinking
we left something out.

733
00:42:54,411 --> 00:42:56,872
Girls? Can you think
of what it might be?

734
00:42:57,623 --> 00:43:00,750
It's the strangest feeling.
Like a bad dream.

735
00:43:00,751 --> 00:43:03,336
Well it could've been
a hell of a lot worse!

736
00:43:03,337 --> 00:43:05,797
That crazy Billy might have
smashed us all into a tree

737
00:43:05,798 --> 00:43:07,048
or something

738
00:43:07,049 --> 00:43:08,592
Or he might have raped all of us.

739
00:43:08,717 --> 00:43:10,719
Before he had that heart attack.

740
00:43:10,803 --> 00:43:13,137
Well there could've been an
easy way to stop him from

741
00:43:13,138 --> 00:43:14,138
raping all of us

742
00:43:14,139 --> 00:43:15,473
Have him start with Debbie!

743
00:43:15,474 --> 00:43:16,641
I don't understand?

744
00:43:16,642 --> 00:43:18,643
We'll explain it to
you sometime, teach.

745
00:43:18,644 --> 00:43:20,145
(Laughter)

746
00:43:23,398 --> 00:43:25,067
Well, I hope you're
all comfortable.

747
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:30,364
I'm certain that everything
will work out just fine.

748
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:36,369
And you, my dear, are you alright?

749
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:38,664
Oh sure. Billy didn't
lay a hand on me.

750
00:43:38,747 --> 00:43:40,541
He didn't have a chance.

751
00:43:40,582 --> 00:43:42,834
I really don't understand.

752
00:43:42,835 --> 00:43:44,795
He seemed like such a nice man.

753
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:48,673
Well, we live out west
where the men are men

754
00:43:48,674 --> 00:43:50,800
and the women are glad of it.

755
00:43:50,801 --> 00:43:52,511
(Laughter)

756
00:43:53,137 --> 00:43:54,303
Really, girls.

757
00:43:54,304 --> 00:43:56,347
I don't know where you come
up with some of these things

758
00:43:56,348 --> 00:43:59,392
Ever try the poetry in the
locker room walls, Mrs. Johnson?

759
00:43:59,393 --> 00:44:00,936
Sometimes. Sure.

760
00:44:01,353 --> 00:44:03,689
Some of it's even left over
from when I was in school.

761
00:44:04,773 --> 00:44:06,984
Not that I understand
it anymore now.

762
00:44:07,192 --> 00:44:11,196
Call 555-1800 for Debbie
and a good time.

763
00:44:11,405 --> 00:44:13,614
Not too hard to understand, Mrs. J?

764
00:44:13,615 --> 00:44:15,908
For girls who can't
memorize a line of

765
00:44:15,909 --> 00:44:17,828
you sure have pretty
inventive minds

766
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:19,287
Who's Keets?

767
00:44:19,288 --> 00:44:21,080
I think the boys wear
them on the bottom

768
00:44:21,081 --> 00:44:22,206
of their football shoes.

769
00:44:22,207 --> 00:44:24,083
(Laughter)

770
00:44:24,084 --> 00:44:25,043
Oh!

771
00:44:26,587 --> 00:44:29,423
How long do you think your
husband will be Miss Bub?

772
00:44:29,548 --> 00:44:32,383
Not long.
He'll just check everything out

773
00:44:32,384 --> 00:44:33,802
and be right back.

774
00:44:34,344 --> 00:44:35,596
More coffee?

775
00:44:36,054 --> 00:44:37,222
No thank you.

776
00:44:38,473 --> 00:44:40,517
If I drink anymore coffee
I'll just bust

777
00:44:40,642 --> 00:44:42,685
No wise cracks from you.

778
00:44:42,686 --> 00:44:44,061
What could I say?

779
00:44:44,062 --> 00:44:46,106
(Laughter)

780
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:50,944
(Satanic phrase)

781
00:44:51,862 --> 00:44:53,947
Oh no. I feel just fine.

782
00:44:55,073 --> 00:44:56,617
What was that?

783
00:44:56,867 --> 00:45:00,870
Oh, I said I was fine.
I never felt better.

784
00:45:00,871 --> 00:45:03,707
That darn phone of yours
would be on the brink.

785
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:05,584
I'd like to know hoe
the game came out.

786
00:45:05,751 --> 00:45:08,544
Stevie probably made
three touchdowns

787
00:45:08,545 --> 00:45:10,504
and is working on his fourth...

788
00:45:10,505 --> 00:45:12,174
...in the bus

789
00:45:12,466 --> 00:45:13,841
You can't score in the buss?

790
00:45:13,842 --> 00:45:16,178
He's done it in stranger
places than that.

791
00:45:17,638 --> 00:45:19,055
Oh I see what you mean.

792
00:45:19,056 --> 00:45:20,933
Planning game strategies and things

793
00:45:21,141 --> 00:45:23,059
Dedicated boy alright.

794
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:25,896
Oh yeah. that's it. Real dedicated.

795
00:45:26,438 --> 00:45:30,150
And sometimes he even
thinks about football.

796
00:45:32,236 --> 00:45:34,570
Are you sure your husband,
the sheriff,

797
00:45:34,571 --> 00:45:36,322
called in the report
on car radio?

798
00:45:36,323 --> 00:45:38,200
I wouldn't want people to worry.

799
00:45:38,325 --> 00:45:42,329
Don't concern yourself.
He's taking care of everything.

800
00:45:43,038 --> 00:45:47,042
Yes. He's taking care of everything.

801
00:46:06,186 --> 00:46:07,729
What... what...

802
00:46:16,071 --> 00:46:18,699
Alright Billy.
You've just had a severe shock

803
00:46:18,991 --> 00:46:20,575
Those girls...

804
00:46:20,951 --> 00:46:22,577
You just passed out, Silly.

805
00:46:22,744 --> 00:46:25,037
But those girls.
Where are those girls?

806
00:46:25,038 --> 00:46:27,540
You promised I could have
any of 'em I wanted!

807
00:46:27,541 --> 00:46:29,042
I want that girl!

808
00:46:29,167 --> 00:46:30,836
She thinks you're dead.

809
00:46:30,961 --> 00:46:32,753
She thinks I'm dead?

810
00:46:32,754 --> 00:46:34,005
But I wanted her!

811
00:46:34,006 --> 00:46:35,256
I know. I know.

812
00:46:35,257 --> 00:46:37,341
Everything about you wanted her.

813
00:46:37,342 --> 00:46:39,386
But you promised
I could have her!

814
00:46:39,428 --> 00:46:41,012
You took her from me!

815
00:46:41,013 --> 00:46:42,221
You cheated me!

816
00:46:42,222 --> 00:46:44,932
Cheat! Cheat!

817
00:46:44,933 --> 00:46:46,435
Cheated me!

818
00:46:46,601 --> 00:46:48,645
Cheat! Cheat!

819
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,995
Alright now, Billy!

820
00:47:05,287 --> 00:47:06,621
Come on!

821
00:47:39,488 --> 00:47:41,656
Geronimo!

822
00:47:53,251 --> 00:47:55,003
What's that thing?

823
00:47:55,087 --> 00:47:56,003
Oh that's nothing.

824
00:47:56,004 --> 00:47:57,881
Just something we
picked up at an auction.

825
00:47:59,216 --> 00:48:00,549
Where's the sheriff?

826
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:02,469
I thought for sure
he'd be back by now?

827
00:48:02,552 --> 00:48:04,221
I hope nothing's happened...

828
00:48:04,304 --> 00:48:06,389
Sure was a spooky place.

829
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:07,723
Oh don't worry.

830
00:48:07,724 --> 00:48:10,393
The sheriff is quite
familiar with the area.

831
00:48:10,394 --> 00:48:12,437
He won't have any trouble.

832
00:48:18,693 --> 00:48:21,530
Oh! Sheriff. It's you.

833
00:48:21,696 --> 00:48:24,741
Well, you look as if you
were expecting Satan himself.

834
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:26,158
Is everything alright?

835
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:27,786
Did you find it like we said?

836
00:48:29,371 --> 00:48:30,913
Just as you said.

837
00:48:30,914 --> 00:48:32,623
Then we're free to go?

838
00:48:32,624 --> 00:48:33,999
No. I'm afraid not.

839
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,583
But...

840
00:48:34,584 --> 00:48:35,794
But soon enough.

841
00:48:36,169 --> 00:48:38,170
You see, I have to get
your sworn statements.

842
00:48:38,171 --> 00:48:39,463
And until I can clear
up some things

843
00:48:39,464 --> 00:48:41,757
I have to continue to treat
this as a murder case.

844
00:48:41,758 --> 00:48:42,926
Murder?

845
00:48:45,262 --> 00:48:46,555
That's right.

846
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:49,141
Emmy, can I see you
outside for a minute?

847
00:48:49,975 --> 00:48:50,851
Of course.

848
00:48:52,477 --> 00:48:53,687
Excuse us.

849
00:49:07,117 --> 00:49:08,618
I'm certain...
- Shhh!

850
00:49:20,589 --> 00:49:22,256
I don't like it.

851
00:49:22,257 --> 00:49:24,049
There's something about
this whole setup that's just

852
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:25,468
not right.

853
00:49:25,469 --> 00:49:26,802
Oh don't be silly.

854
00:49:26,803 --> 00:49:29,222
The sheriff is handling everything
in the most efficient manner.

855
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:32,267
After all, we are all
material witnesses.

856
00:49:33,018 --> 00:49:36,146
I say lets split. What do we
have to hang around here for?

857
00:49:36,354 --> 00:49:39,483
Maybe we can still make it in
time for the post game party?

858
00:49:39,524 --> 00:49:42,027
That way the day wouldn't be a total loss.

859
00:49:42,277 --> 00:49:44,279
I'm going to check on that dude.

860
00:49:44,362 --> 00:49:45,988
He's up to something.

861
00:49:45,989 --> 00:49:47,907
Leave it a lone, Chris.

862
00:49:47,908 --> 00:49:49,951
I don't think you should
go out there, Chris

863
00:49:52,037 --> 00:49:53,788
Listen to me now and
remember what I say.

864
00:49:54,122 --> 00:49:56,666
I have been commanded
by the prince of darkness.

865
00:49:56,833 --> 00:49:58,960
He spoke to me
right there alter.

866
00:49:59,419 --> 00:50:03,089
So tonight for the first time
we will perform the black mass

867
00:50:03,131 --> 00:50:04,798
just as in the ancient ritual.

868
00:50:04,799 --> 00:50:06,175
You cant mean it?

869
00:50:06,176 --> 00:50:07,594
A sacrifice?

870
00:50:07,761 --> 00:50:09,221
It is his command.

871
00:50:25,654 --> 00:50:28,572
...So tonight the blood
of an unsoiled maiden

872
00:50:28,573 --> 00:50:30,617
will into the jeweled chalice.

873
00:50:30,659 --> 00:50:31,867
But which?

874
00:50:31,868 --> 00:50:33,370
The one that is pure.

875
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:35,830
Then it's death for that one.

876
00:50:36,122 --> 00:50:37,581
Death for all of them.

877
00:50:37,582 --> 00:50:39,376
There will be no surviving whiteness.

878
00:50:39,543 --> 00:50:41,168
I'll say the janitor
killed them all

879
00:50:41,169 --> 00:50:42,753
and then suffered
his fatal attack.

880
00:50:42,754 --> 00:50:43,964
It's the perfect cover.

881
00:50:45,507 --> 00:50:47,342
It's our moment of glory!

882
00:50:47,425 --> 00:50:48,926
Praise be to Satan!

883
00:50:48,927 --> 00:50:52,180
That we have been chosen...
(Dogs bark)

884
00:50:53,765 --> 00:50:55,809
Beelzebub! Diablo! Quiet!

885
00:50:55,892 --> 00:50:57,435
The dogs... They know.

886
00:50:57,686 --> 00:51:00,063
Already they smell the blood of sacrifice.

887
00:51:15,245 --> 00:51:16,745
You wont believe this!
They're going to kill us!

888
00:51:16,746 --> 00:51:17,788
Come on! We got to get out of here!

889
00:51:17,789 --> 00:51:18,747
What happened?

890
00:51:18,748 --> 00:51:19,665
There's no time!

891
00:51:19,666 --> 00:51:20,917
Come on you guys!

892
00:51:21,167 --> 00:51:23,836
Stop playing these silly games!
Now listen to me!

893
00:51:23,837 --> 00:51:25,504
No! You've got to listen to me!

894
00:51:25,505 --> 00:51:27,007
Believe me! There's no time!

895
00:51:28,008 --> 00:51:29,426
Oh god! They're here!

896
00:51:37,017 --> 00:51:38,392
Don't say anything.

897
00:51:38,393 --> 00:51:39,727
Just act natural.

898
00:51:39,728 --> 00:51:41,353
Everybody just relax.

899
00:51:41,354 --> 00:51:44,566
I'll get their attention.
You guys try to get away.

900
00:51:50,447 --> 00:51:52,824
Hi sheriff. What's going on?

901
00:51:52,949 --> 00:51:55,034
If you could just take
those statements now

902
00:51:55,035 --> 00:51:56,911
we really should be on our way.

903
00:51:57,078 --> 00:51:58,622
All in good time.

904
00:51:59,205 --> 00:52:01,541
Of course I haven't finished
my investigation yet.

905
00:52:02,042 --> 00:52:04,461
So I'm afraid I can't release
you ladies just yet.

906
00:52:04,544 --> 00:52:06,962
But you have notified the
authorities back in Benedict?

907
00:52:06,963 --> 00:52:09,381
Our parents are probably on
their way here right now.

908
00:52:09,382 --> 00:52:11,676
Besides, Deb's got a
hot date tonight.

909
00:52:12,218 --> 00:52:13,552
Sorry to inconvenience you

910
00:52:13,553 --> 00:52:15,680
but there are a few things
that have to be cleared up.

911
00:52:16,222 --> 00:52:18,349
We're holding a special
inquest this evening.

912
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:20,726
Oh! We've got to make
some phone calls.

913
00:52:20,727 --> 00:52:23,020
I'm sorry. You know my
phone is out of order.

914
00:52:23,021 --> 00:52:24,855
I can't have you running around.

915
00:52:24,856 --> 00:52:26,608
Can I use your bathroom?

916
00:52:27,525 --> 00:52:30,110
Oh of course. It's at the
top of the stairs.

917
00:52:30,111 --> 00:52:31,820
We'll come with you Chris.

918
00:52:31,821 --> 00:52:33,447
That's a good idea.

919
00:52:33,448 --> 00:52:35,909
There's a guest bedroom there
where you can rest.

920
00:52:36,409 --> 00:52:37,702
First door on the left.

921
00:52:46,294 --> 00:52:48,128
Could I speak to you for a moment?

922
00:52:48,129 --> 00:52:49,297
Sure

923
00:52:53,009 --> 00:52:55,595
You may be able to fool
the others but not me.

924
00:52:56,054 --> 00:52:58,765
You've been lying and
I'd like to know why?

925
00:52:59,224 --> 00:53:01,350
That's quite an accusation.

926
00:53:01,351 --> 00:53:02,060
It it?

927
00:53:02,602 --> 00:53:04,646
Why have you been staring at me?

928
00:53:04,938 --> 00:53:07,231
You have an overactive
imagination young lady.

929
00:53:07,232 --> 00:53:09,233
You better get upstairs
with the others.

930
00:53:09,234 --> 00:53:11,277
Why doesn't your wife answer me?

931
00:53:13,363 --> 00:53:14,530
I demand you let us go!

932
00:53:14,531 --> 00:53:16,866
You can't hold us like this.
It's not right!

933
00:53:18,451 --> 00:53:20,869
Go on Sharon, go ahead!

934
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:21,996
It's okay.

935
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:24,081
Are you okay?

936
00:53:24,082 --> 00:53:25,207
Yeah!

937
00:53:25,208 --> 00:53:26,625
Come on Mrs. Johnson!

938
00:53:26,626 --> 00:53:27,377
Come on!

939
00:53:27,419 --> 00:53:29,254
Please!

940
00:53:30,004 --> 00:53:31,964
No girls! Go on! Please!

941
00:53:31,965 --> 00:53:32,881
Go on without me.

942
00:53:32,882 --> 00:53:33,842
Hurry!

943
00:53:33,967 --> 00:53:35,551
Come with us please!

944
00:53:35,552 --> 00:53:36,886
Go ahead! Please Debbie.

945
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:38,388
Hurry!

946
00:53:44,144 --> 00:53:47,063
Sheriff, you still haven’t
answered my question?

947
00:53:47,188 --> 00:53:49,941
Why is your wife staring at me?

948
00:53:50,692 --> 00:53:52,402
She isn't staring at you.

949
00:53:53,236 --> 00:53:54,862
For the last time young lady

950
00:53:54,863 --> 00:53:56,071
you better get upstairs
with the others.

951
00:53:56,072 --> 00:53:58,491
Don't touch me!

952
00:54:01,828 --> 00:54:04,205
Watch her! Don't let
her out of your sight!

953
00:54:12,756 --> 00:54:13,923
Oh!

954
00:54:15,633 --> 00:54:16,843
I can't!

955
00:54:22,515 --> 00:54:23,349
Oh!

956
00:54:23,725 --> 00:54:25,185
Hi teacher.

957
00:54:25,685 --> 00:54:27,812
Oh! Hi there sheriff.

958
00:54:28,104 --> 00:54:29,397
Oh!

959
00:54:29,689 --> 00:54:31,441
Come here Debbie. Over here.

960
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:36,237
They've got some kind
of crazy satan cult.

961
00:54:36,362 --> 00:54:39,449
They plan to sacrifice one of
us as an unsoiled maiden he said

962
00:54:39,532 --> 00:54:42,117
Unsoiled maiden?
You've got to be kidding man!

963
00:54:42,118 --> 00:54:43,702
This isn't the middle ages!

964
00:54:43,703 --> 00:54:45,412
What's an unsoiled maiden?

965
00:54:45,413 --> 00:54:46,955
It's a virgin stupid!

966
00:54:46,956 --> 00:54:48,957
They'll kill us! They're all of them witches

967
00:54:48,958 --> 00:54:50,626
They'll sick those dogs on us!

968
00:54:50,627 --> 00:54:52,837
We're going to have to get to a
phone right now. I mean quick.

969
00:54:52,962 --> 00:54:55,798
Let's split up. That way one
of us has got to make it.

970
00:54:55,799 --> 00:54:57,633
What about all for one?

971
00:54:57,634 --> 00:54:59,593
What about Mrs. Johnson, Patti.
Chris is right.

972
00:54:59,594 --> 00:55:01,970
Our best chance is to split
up and get to a phone.

973
00:55:01,971 --> 00:55:04,306
I'll call Stevie. He'll come to our rescue.

974
00:55:04,307 --> 00:55:05,724
Bull! Wake up girl!

975
00:55:05,725 --> 00:55:08,936
This is serious! Stevie's probably
drunk in someone's back seat.

976
00:55:08,937 --> 00:55:11,313
If we make it to a phone
we call our parents.

977
00:55:11,314 --> 00:55:12,439
Agreed?

978
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,442
Sure. I was just kidding.

979
00:55:15,026 --> 00:55:16,401
My god!

980
00:55:16,402 --> 00:55:18,196
Mrs. Johnson! Where is she?

981
00:55:21,699 --> 00:55:23,116
Ahhh!

982
00:55:23,117 --> 00:55:24,243
Let go!

983
00:55:24,244 --> 00:55:26,329
Stop! Please!
Ahh!

984
00:55:26,538 --> 00:55:27,830
Let go of me!

985
00:55:27,831 --> 00:55:28,789
Stop!

986
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:29,706
Please!

987
00:55:29,707 --> 00:55:30,874
Stop it!

988
00:55:30,875 --> 00:55:31,917
Shut up!

989
00:55:31,918 --> 00:55:33,502
Stop it! What are you doing?!

990
00:55:33,503 --> 00:55:34,921
Shut up I said!

991
00:55:35,088 --> 00:55:36,005
Stop it!

992
00:55:39,342 --> 00:55:41,176
Ahh! Let go of me!

993
00:55:41,177 --> 00:55:42,095
Ugh!

994
00:55:45,557 --> 00:55:47,516
Come on you guys
lets split right now.

995
00:55:47,517 --> 00:55:49,644
You go that way. You go that
way and I'll go this way.

996
00:55:49,936 --> 00:55:51,062
Wait a minute!

997
00:55:53,231 --> 00:55:55,483
Everybody take an
emergency dime.

998
00:55:55,733 --> 00:55:56,609
Here.

999
00:55:58,236 --> 00:56:00,905
For once my mother knew
what she was talking about.

1000
00:56:18,715 --> 00:56:19,299
Oh!

1001
00:56:19,382 --> 00:56:21,091
Please would you stop it.

1002
00:56:21,092 --> 00:56:23,219
Ah!

1003
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,096
Where are they?! Huh?

1004
00:56:25,263 --> 00:56:26,179
Tell me, where are they?!

1005
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:27,306
I wont tell you a thing!

1006
00:56:27,307 --> 00:56:28,182
You creep!

1007
00:56:28,391 --> 00:56:31,519
You can kill me first I wont
tell you a thing about my girls!

1008
00:57:18,066 --> 00:57:19,859
Stop it! What are you doing?

1009
00:57:20,276 --> 00:57:22,152
It doesn't make any difference now

1010
00:57:22,153 --> 00:57:23,196
they wont get far anyway.

1011
00:57:23,404 --> 00:57:26,407
I'm going to teach you a
real lesson, teacher.

1012
00:57:27,116 --> 00:57:28,201
Ah!

1013
00:57:32,205 --> 00:57:33,748
What are you doing?

1014
00:57:33,873 --> 00:57:37,418
Please! What are you doing?
I'll tell your wife!

1015
00:57:46,594 --> 00:57:47,387
Hey!

1016
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:48,887
Hey listen to me!

1017
00:57:48,888 --> 00:57:49,888
Please!

1018
00:57:49,889 --> 00:57:51,056
Where the others?

1019
00:57:51,057 --> 00:57:51,640
You've got to

1020
00:57:51,641 --> 00:57:53,392
Where are they?
You're one of them aren't you?

1021
00:57:53,393 --> 00:57:54,434
From the road?

1022
00:57:54,435 --> 00:57:55,644
Found my home.

1023
00:57:55,645 --> 00:57:56,979
Can you help me please?

1024
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:57,396
Look...

1025
00:57:57,397 --> 00:57:59,064
Be quiet. Will you please
listen to me.

1026
00:57:59,065 --> 00:58:00,524
I'm not goin' to tell nobody
- Stop a minute!

1027
00:58:00,525 --> 00:58:01,608
Listen to me
- Nothin'

1028
00:58:01,609 --> 00:58:02,734
No no!
- You found my home

1029
00:58:02,735 --> 00:58:03,610
How'd you do it?

1030
00:58:03,611 --> 00:58:04,945
How'd you do that?

1031
00:58:04,946 --> 00:58:06,571
Listen to me please!
- Nobody's supposed to do that!

1032
00:58:06,572 --> 00:58:08,824
I'm in trouble!
- You all know I'm just a crazy

1033
00:58:08,825 --> 00:58:09,574
old bum.

1034
00:58:09,575 --> 00:58:12,077
Can you help me please! My
father will pay if you help me!

1035
00:58:12,078 --> 00:58:13,162
He'd pay you!

1036
00:58:15,415 --> 00:58:16,499
He'd pay me?

1037
00:58:16,666 --> 00:58:18,750
How much? How much'd
would your father pay me?

1038
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:20,711
A lot! Just help me
get out of here!

1039
00:58:20,712 --> 00:58:23,172
Get away? From who?
You're one of them!

1040
00:58:23,589 --> 00:58:25,549
You don't understand! the sheriff...

1041
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:29,554
The sheriff... yeah.
He's a friend of mine.

1042
00:58:31,222 --> 00:58:35,226
Shh. Don't you tell anybody.
But I know the secret.

1043
00:58:35,435 --> 00:58:39,439
Yeah. I know the secret. Yeah.

1044
00:58:42,191 --> 00:58:45,278
Oh my god! Where's my
dime! I lost my dime!

1045
00:58:50,324 --> 00:58:51,659
Excuse me.

1046
00:59:03,629 --> 00:59:05,673
I'm crazy. I think I am.

1047
00:59:06,174 --> 00:59:08,342
Right here. Let me
show you something.

1048
00:59:08,634 --> 00:59:09,302
Look!

1049
00:59:12,013 --> 00:59:12,847
Look.

1050
00:59:15,058 --> 00:59:15,767
Yeah.

1051
00:59:17,185 --> 00:59:19,062
They think I'm crazy

1052
00:59:19,312 --> 00:59:21,355
They're witches. They pray

1053
00:59:22,398 --> 00:59:23,983
I know the secret.

1054
00:59:24,442 --> 00:59:26,318
Full moon, killing things.

1055
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:27,779
I know the secret

1056
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:36,203
Hey, How much? How much
your daddy pay me?

1057
00:59:36,204 --> 00:59:38,455
A lot! A lot! Please
just help me.

1058
00:59:38,456 --> 00:59:39,916
Don't let the sheriff get me!

1059
00:59:41,167 --> 00:59:42,627
The sheriff gave me this.

1060
00:59:43,002 --> 00:59:45,421
I'm crazy. At least they think so.

1061
00:59:45,713 --> 00:59:48,299
They're the crazy ones.
Everybody.

1062
00:59:48,466 --> 00:59:50,009
All around!

1063
00:59:50,134 --> 00:59:51,927
Everywhere!

1064
00:59:51,928 --> 00:59:54,180
Don't you see? Look!

1065
00:59:54,388 --> 00:59:55,890
Behind you!

1066
00:59:56,307 --> 00:59:57,432
No!

1067
00:59:57,433 --> 01:00:01,437
Scaredy cat! Scaredy Cat! Ha ha!

1068
01:00:29,549 --> 01:00:30,842
Stay away!

1069
01:00:31,342 --> 01:00:33,052
Stay away from me.

1070
01:00:33,302 --> 01:00:35,972
In the name of Lucifer
as his high priest

1071
01:00:36,848 --> 01:00:38,724
I command the demon

1072
01:00:39,392 --> 01:00:42,019
return to thy dark regions.

1073
01:00:42,603 --> 01:00:45,356
Get the away from me.

1074
01:01:08,921 --> 01:01:10,506
Howdy Ma'am.

1075
01:01:11,382 --> 01:01:13,466
You've got to help me. I'm lost.
They're after me.

1076
01:01:13,467 --> 01:01:15,469
Please sir, let me use your phone!

1077
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:19,556
Who are you? Where you from?

1078
01:01:19,557 --> 01:01:20,640
We're from Benedict.

1079
01:01:20,641 --> 01:01:22,809
We were on our way to the game
the car crashed

1080
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:24,978
Please help me.
Billy died!

1081
01:01:24,979 --> 01:01:27,105
The sheriff's going to
kill us or something!

1082
01:01:27,106 --> 01:01:30,193
Are you runin' from
from the sheriff?

1083
01:01:31,068 --> 01:01:32,403
Huh?

1084
01:01:56,636 --> 01:01:57,929
Oh Father!

1085
01:01:58,221 --> 01:02:00,181
My I help you my child?

1086
01:02:00,514 --> 01:02:02,599
We're in trouble.
You've just got to help us.

1087
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:04,017
I lost my dime and...

1088
01:02:04,018 --> 01:02:05,393
You came to the right place

1089
01:02:05,394 --> 01:02:06,978
How may I help you?

1090
01:02:06,979 --> 01:02:08,772
The sheriff, he's trying to kill us

1091
01:02:08,773 --> 01:02:11,442
He's the leader of some
kind of crazy devil cult.

1092
01:02:11,817 --> 01:02:14,320
Now I'm sure you're mistaken.

1093
01:02:14,612 --> 01:02:16,739
What sort of cult did you say?

1094
01:02:19,242 --> 01:02:20,868
Jesus Christ!

1095
01:02:23,537 --> 01:02:26,290
Close. But not exactly my dear.

1096
01:02:26,707 --> 01:02:30,710
(Phone ringing)
Pick up the phone. Please

1097
01:02:30,711 --> 01:02:33,047
Hurry up. Oh god!

1098
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:35,716
Oh my god!

1099
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:36,759
- Hello?

1100
01:02:36,926 --> 01:02:38,427
What are you doing?!

1101
01:02:38,594 --> 01:02:40,721
Stop it! What are you doing?

1102
01:02:40,763 --> 01:02:43,641
Stay away from me!

1103
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:45,518
Let me out of here!

1104
01:02:45,851 --> 01:02:47,436
Stay away!

1105
01:02:52,775 --> 01:02:53,985
Gotcha honey!

1106
01:03:00,533 --> 01:03:01,950
Get into that holding pen honey!

1107
01:03:01,951 --> 01:03:03,828
Just like all the rest
of my little horses.

1108
01:03:03,995 --> 01:03:05,412
Now giddy up!

1109
01:03:05,413 --> 01:03:06,580
Giddy up!

1110
01:03:08,291 --> 01:03:09,500
Now giddy up!

1111
01:03:13,045 --> 01:03:14,297
No! No!

1112
01:03:14,422 --> 01:03:16,841
Please don't hurt me! no!

1113
01:03:17,341 --> 01:03:19,302
Look. I'll do anything you want

1114
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:20,593
Just try me. Please!

1115
01:03:20,594 --> 01:03:23,306
I'll do anything you want,
But please don't hurt me!

1116
01:03:23,639 --> 01:03:27,643
No my dear, not what
I want, what he wants.

1117
01:03:28,561 --> 01:03:30,438
I'm afraid of her.

1118
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:33,065
And you should be too.

1119
01:03:33,774 --> 01:03:35,860
I tell you she has the power!

1120
01:03:36,569 --> 01:03:38,321
Don't be ridicules!

1121
01:03:39,905 --> 01:03:41,615
I recognize her.

1122
01:03:42,616 --> 01:03:44,660
Something. Somewhere.

1123
01:03:45,494 --> 01:03:47,413
I can't put my finger on it.

1124
01:03:48,289 --> 01:03:50,291
But one thing I'm certain of

1125
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,710
she has the power!

1126
01:03:53,044 --> 01:03:54,669
My god woman!
She has no power at all.

1127
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:56,255
Anyone can tell that.

1128
01:03:57,006 --> 01:03:58,591
Look at her!

1129
01:04:16,484 --> 01:04:20,488
Get your hands off.
Come on!

1130
01:04:31,165 --> 01:04:32,666
Diablo! Lucifer!

1131
01:04:35,252 --> 01:04:36,295
Get in there!

1132
01:04:41,092 --> 01:04:42,968
Shut up! Get in there!

1133
01:04:49,183 --> 01:04:50,810
I was thinking I should stay?

1134
01:04:50,976 --> 01:04:52,937
They may be in need of prayer.

1135
01:04:53,145 --> 01:04:54,522
Thank you monk.

1136
01:04:54,814 --> 01:04:56,690
But the dogs will
take care of them.

1137
01:04:56,899 --> 01:05:00,444
Tonight will be a night of glory
such as we have never known.

1138
01:05:04,532 --> 01:05:08,535
(Dogs whine)

1139
01:05:08,536 --> 01:05:12,498
(Dogs barking)

1140
01:05:19,046 --> 01:05:20,798
Sheriff. Sheriff

1141
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,466
Well what is it this time?

1142
01:05:22,633 --> 01:05:24,592
Well uh some of the towns people

1143
01:05:24,593 --> 01:05:26,636
feel that if the human
sacrifice tonight..

1144
01:05:26,637 --> 01:05:27,638
Yes!

1145
01:05:28,347 --> 01:05:31,349
Well that is that they feel that
perhaps the prince of darkness

1146
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:34,102
might desire that the blood
of a maiden flow tonight?

1147
01:05:34,103 --> 01:05:35,146
That's right.

1148
01:05:35,438 --> 01:05:36,730
A maiden?

1149
01:05:37,148 --> 01:05:38,982
Look Monk. I'm very busy!

1150
01:05:38,983 --> 01:05:39,817
A maiden!

1151
01:05:40,067 --> 01:05:41,235
A maiden!

1152
01:05:41,277 --> 01:05:45,281
A maiden. Yes that's very good.
Much better than a dwarf.

1153
01:05:46,532 --> 01:05:50,536
I don't understand you.
Cowering before that school girl

1154
01:05:50,619 --> 01:05:52,538
I'm not mistaken!

1155
01:05:52,621 --> 01:05:54,290
You have to kill her.

1156
01:05:54,665 --> 01:05:57,710
Kill her now before
it is too late!

1157
01:05:57,877 --> 01:05:59,712
She'll destroy us all!

1158
01:06:01,046 --> 01:06:01,755
Women.

1159
01:06:03,048 --> 01:06:04,924
Marry them. Make
them a high priest.

1160
01:06:04,925 --> 01:06:06,594
Give them all the powers
and what happens?

1161
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:08,637
They become stupid and jealous!

1162
01:06:08,888 --> 01:06:10,889
The prince of darkness
will make his choice

1163
01:06:10,890 --> 01:06:12,433
and they will all die.

1164
01:06:38,292 --> 01:06:46,292
(satanic chant)

1165
01:07:10,407 --> 01:07:12,952
Be careful Patti.
Don't let him bite you.

1166
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:14,787
Come on out. It's okay.

1167
01:07:15,162 --> 01:07:17,248
Come on out. It's okay I tell you.

1168
01:07:18,624 --> 01:07:20,876
You've got to be kidding Patti.
He wants me for lunch.

1169
01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:23,295
Don't make any sudden moves.

1170
01:07:23,712 --> 01:07:25,965
I am making sudden moves.

1171
01:07:26,298 --> 01:07:28,092
Only really slow.

1172
01:07:30,636 --> 01:07:31,554
Come on!

1173
01:07:32,221 --> 01:07:34,056
Go on Chris.

1174
01:08:03,836 --> 01:08:11,836
(Satanic chant)

1175
01:09:05,898 --> 01:09:07,191
It's time!

1176
01:09:08,567 --> 01:09:09,860
You ready?

1177
01:09:10,402 --> 01:09:11,570
Yes.

1178
01:09:11,654 --> 01:09:13,154
But you're mistaken.

1179
01:09:13,155 --> 01:09:14,907
She does have the power!

1180
01:09:16,450 --> 01:09:17,910
Come on woman.

1181
01:09:54,822 --> 01:09:56,322
Bring them out.

1182
01:09:56,323 --> 01:09:57,490
Bring them out!

1183
01:09:57,491 --> 01:09:58,742
Quickly! The maiden.

1184
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:05,123
Good boys.

1185
01:10:05,124 --> 01:10:06,667
Keep our little
goodies safe, huh?

1186
01:10:06,875 --> 01:10:08,752
They're gone! They disappeared!

1187
01:10:09,753 --> 01:10:11,379
What do you mean they're gone?

1188
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:13,172
Lucifer and Diablo would
have torn them apart

1189
01:10:13,173 --> 01:10:14,550
if they tried to get away.

1190
01:10:19,221 --> 01:10:22,182
Holy mother. They vanished.

1191
01:10:22,391 --> 01:10:23,933
Will you stop that
with you hands?

1192
01:10:23,934 --> 01:10:26,395
It's a terrible habit and
its getting very irritating!

1193
01:10:27,104 --> 01:10:28,897
What do you mean
they vanished?

1194
01:10:29,273 --> 01:10:30,773
Then it is a miracle.

1195
01:10:30,774 --> 01:10:33,569
The only miracle is that
I put up with you!

1196
01:10:35,487 --> 01:10:37,905
She's cast a spell on the dogs!

1197
01:10:37,906 --> 01:10:40,116
She has the power, that one!

1198
01:10:40,117 --> 01:10:41,409
Turn back!

1199
01:10:41,410 --> 01:10:43,704
Turn back all of you
before it's too late!

1200
01:10:43,871 --> 01:10:46,039
Be quiet woman
or I'll lock you in here!

1201
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,960
Where were you when
they got away? Huh?

1202
01:10:50,043 --> 01:10:51,377
Bad dogs!
(dogs whimper)

1203
01:10:51,378 --> 01:10:52,212
Bad dogs!

1204
01:10:52,588 --> 01:10:54,757
Bad dogs!

1205
01:10:57,384 --> 01:10:58,801
Back off!

1206
01:10:58,802 --> 01:11:01,722
- Lucifer! Diablo! Go! Get them!

1207
01:11:01,972 --> 01:11:03,974
Get them! Kill! Kill!

1208
01:11:04,057 --> 01:11:05,184
Get them!

1209
01:11:05,434 --> 01:11:06,935
(Dogs barking)

1210
01:11:07,394 --> 01:11:09,061
Damn it woman! Shut up!

1211
01:11:09,062 --> 01:11:11,230
We want live bodies for
the prince of darkness.

1212
01:11:11,231 --> 01:11:12,398
Not shredded corpses!

1213
01:11:12,399 --> 01:11:14,067
Come on boys! Come on!

1214
01:11:39,551 --> 01:11:41,094
Bloody dogs!

1215
01:11:41,678 --> 01:11:43,472
We'll go after them on foot.

1216
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:46,016
They can't get far they
don't know the terrain.

1217
01:11:47,142 --> 01:11:49,353
When we get to the woods
fan out.

1218
01:11:49,394 --> 01:11:50,686
Yes and you remember that.

1219
01:11:50,687 --> 01:11:54,106
Each and every one of you. When
you get to the woods, spread out

1220
01:11:54,107 --> 01:11:57,610
I didn't say that. I said when you
get to the woods fan out!

1221
01:11:57,611 --> 01:11:59,570
If you're going to copy me, copy me!

1222
01:11:59,571 --> 01:12:00,781
Lets go.

1223
01:12:06,703 --> 01:12:07,870
Hold it you guys.

1224
01:12:07,871 --> 01:12:08,663
Whats the matter?

1225
01:12:08,664 --> 01:12:10,082
I can't go on!

1226
01:12:10,791 --> 01:12:12,333
Hold it.

1227
01:12:12,334 --> 01:12:13,001
Wait!

1228
01:12:13,877 --> 01:12:16,004
I can't go on another step.

1229
01:12:16,171 --> 01:12:17,589
I'm sorry.

1230
01:12:18,173 --> 01:12:20,342
I'm having so much trouble.

1231
01:12:21,426 --> 01:12:24,596
I'm sorry. I can't go
on another step.

1232
01:12:24,888 --> 01:12:26,598
Just another mile or so.

1233
01:12:26,682 --> 01:12:27,932
Just over that ridge.

1234
01:12:27,933 --> 01:12:29,517
Well how do you know we'll
get to the main highway

1235
01:12:29,518 --> 01:12:31,186
they wont be waiting?

1236
01:12:31,770 --> 01:12:32,771
I know.

1237
01:12:33,647 --> 01:12:36,483
You sure know a hell of a
lot all of the sudden.

1238
01:12:36,567 --> 01:12:37,942
Yeah Patti.
You've been draggin' us

1239
01:12:37,943 --> 01:12:41,404
all over this mountain like you
were a gym teacher or something.

1240
01:12:41,405 --> 01:12:44,699
Fine. Why don't we all just sit
here nice and comfortable

1241
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:47,159
and wait for the dogs
to eat us alive.

1242
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,580
Okay John Wayne.
We got the picture.

1243
01:12:49,705 --> 01:12:52,415
Come on Mrs. Johnson.
Lets hit the trail. Up. Up. Up!

1244
01:12:52,416 --> 01:12:54,083
No. You guys go on with out me

1245
01:12:54,084 --> 01:12:55,585
I've just been a drag.

1246
01:12:55,586 --> 01:12:56,753
No way teach.

1247
01:12:57,129 --> 01:12:59,005
Where we going to find
another one like you?

1248
01:12:59,006 --> 01:13:00,131
Come on. Up and attam

1249
01:13:00,132 --> 01:13:02,049
One for all and all for one!

1250
01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:04,177
Are we going to stand here talking?

1251
01:13:06,263 --> 01:13:08,265
Those dogs seemed
pretty hungry to me.

1252
01:13:08,974 --> 01:13:10,433
I think she's half
mountain goat.

1253
01:13:10,434 --> 01:13:13,769
Okay you guys.
I wont hold you back again.

1254
01:13:13,770 --> 01:13:14,479
Come on.

1255

(Satanic chant)

1256
01:14:56,999 --> 01:14:59,584
Diablo. Lucifer. Go get them all.

1257
01:15:00,419 --> 01:15:01,795
Kill them all!

1258
01:15:02,587 --> 01:15:03,046
Go!

(Dogs barking)

1260
01:15:07,509 --> 01:15:08,468
What's that?

1261
01:15:08,677 --> 01:15:09,594
Someone's coming!

1262
01:15:09,886 --> 01:15:11,762
It only sounds like
or two people

1263
01:15:11,763 --> 01:15:12,973
Maybe we could over
power them!

1264
01:15:13,598 --> 01:15:14,766
It might be those dogs

1265
01:15:14,808 --> 01:15:16,560
Quick you guys. Look for sticks!

1266
01:15:21,398 --> 01:15:27,738
(Rustling in the bushes)

1267
01:15:29,322 --> 01:15:30,198
( Goat baas)

1268
01:15:30,907 --> 01:15:31,950

1270
01:15:43,795 --> 01:15:45,504

Yes. I know what you mean.

1276
01:15:54,056 --> 01:15:56,058
You? What do you
know about women?

1277
01:15:57,142 --> 01:15:58,810
I'm very well read!

1278
01:15:58,977 --> 01:16:00,186
And I dream a lot.

1279
01:16:00,187 --> 01:16:01,396

That woman will pay for this!

1309
01:18:24,456 --> 01:18:27,542
We better hurry. The dogs will

Don't stop here!

We've got to go on.

1336
01:20:06,057 --> 01:20:07,642
It wont help to go on.

1337
01:20:07,851 --> 01:20:09,769
Patti, don't say that.

1338
01:20:10,353 --> 01:20:11,854
This is an evil place.

1339
01:20:11,855 --> 01:20:13,565
Come on we can make it?

1340
01:20:13,898 --> 01:20:16,693
Perhaps. But we
can't out run it.

1341

-(chant continues)

1342
01:20:24,951 --> 01:20:26,536

1344
01:20:28,413 --> 01:20:29,497
Satan! Hear me!

(Growl)

1353
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:55,482
What's going on?

1354
01:20:57,901 --> 01:21:00,028

- Kill!

1368
01:22:09,681 --> 01:22:13,852
(Dogs barking)

1369
01:22:22,152 --> 01:22:23,820
They're at the alter.

1370
01:22:25,655 --> 01:22:30,368
-(Patti chanting)

1371
01:22:33,663 --> 01:22:36,040
Oh my god. That scared
the hell out of me.

1372
01:22:36,166 --> 01:22:37,959
Something scared the
hell out of them.

1373
01:22:39,002 --> 01:22:41,296
Well it's only our
alter over there.

1374
01:22:41,504 --> 01:22:43,214
What could have frightened them?

1375
01:22:43,715 --> 01:22:44,591
Come on!

1376
01:22:49,637 --> 01:22:57,637
-(Patti chanting)

1377
01:23:21,794 --> 01:23:22,629
Satan!

1378
01:23:23,296 --> 01:23:25,340
Why have thou forsaken me!

1379
01:23:26,341 --> 01:23:31,054
-(Patti chanting)

1380
01:23:45,151 --> 01:23:46,027
My god!

1381
01:23:46,277 --> 01:23:48,654
You are one brave girl!

1382
01:23:48,655 --> 01:23:49,780
Come on lets get out of here!

1383
01:23:49,781 --> 01:23:50,447
Please!

1384
01:23:50,448 --> 01:23:51,532
At least it's over now.

1385
01:23:51,533 --> 01:23:52,617
- Not quite!

1386
01:23:52,992 --> 01:23:55,745
Prepare them for the
sacrifice at midnight.

1387
01:23:58,915 --> 01:24:00,332
Let go of me!

1388
01:24:00,333 --> 01:24:01,918
(Screams)

1389
01:24:13,638 --> 01:24:16,307
(Satan chant)

1390
01:24:16,599 --> 01:24:18,560
Hear me Prince of night.

1391
01:24:19,102 --> 01:24:21,104
I have followed your command.

1392
01:24:21,563 --> 01:24:23,690
I have brought you
four maidens.

1393
01:24:24,399 --> 01:24:26,901
The unsoiled one
to be your bride.

1394
01:24:29,862 --> 01:24:32,031
In the ancient ritual.

1395
01:24:32,615 --> 01:24:34,908
(growling)
Guide us and to determine

1396
01:24:34,909 --> 01:24:36,202
which is the one.

1397
01:24:39,831 --> 01:24:41,374
Bring the first

1398
01:24:42,625 --> 01:24:43,835
Let go of me!

1399
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:46,713
Let go of me you goon!

1400
01:24:47,005 --> 01:24:48,673
Is she the unsoiled maiden?

1401
01:24:49,007 --> 01:24:51,551
Is she the on chosen
to be your bride?

1402
01:24:51,634 --> 01:24:53,636
Are you kidding man?
I'm no maiden.

1403
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:55,679
I've been a cheerleader
for three years

1404
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,973
The truth!

1405
01:24:57,181 --> 01:24:58,850
Are you pure?

1406
01:24:59,142 --> 01:25:01,560
Listen man I'm as pure
as the next guy

1407
01:25:01,561 --> 01:25:03,228
But if all this mumbo
jumbo means

1408
01:25:03,229 --> 01:25:04,771
have I ever made
it with anybody?

1409
01:25:04,772 --> 01:25:06,774
You got the wrong maiden.

1410
01:25:09,277 --> 01:25:10,111
The next one.

1411
01:25:12,363 --> 01:25:14,991
Hey. I just figured
all this jive out.

1412
01:25:15,116 --> 01:25:17,660
This whole thing is one big put-on!

1413
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:20,038
You just tried to scare us.

1414
01:25:20,288 --> 01:25:22,373
Just to get what you wanted.
Right?

1415
01:25:22,498 --> 01:25:23,791
Be quiet!

1416
01:25:24,042 --> 01:25:25,710
You're in his presence.

1417
01:25:25,835 --> 01:25:28,463
Hay man, I can dig it. That's cool.

1418
01:25:28,588 --> 01:25:31,924
If your boss man wants me,
I'm no one to argue.

1419
01:25:32,508 --> 01:25:33,509
Take her away.

1420
01:25:34,844 --> 01:25:36,888
I guess you can't
handle the real thing.

1421
01:25:39,307 --> 01:25:41,059
Bring the big one.

1422
01:25:42,435 --> 01:25:43,810
What do you mean big one?

1423
01:25:43,811 --> 01:25:46,104
I have big ones. Bigger than most.

1424
01:25:46,105 --> 01:25:46,898
Is that it?

1425
01:25:48,775 --> 01:25:50,109
Is she the one?

1426
01:25:50,526 --> 01:25:51,943
(growling)

1427
01:25:51,944 --> 01:25:54,863
Is she the princes chosen
by the prince of darkness

1428
01:25:54,864 --> 01:25:56,324
to be his bride?

1429
01:25:56,699 --> 01:25:58,993
Listen man, I ain’t no princes.

1430
01:26:01,579 --> 01:26:03,414
You're the one.

1431
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:06,376
Place her on the alter.

1432
01:26:07,085 --> 01:26:09,002
You're crazy man!
I haven't been

1433
01:26:09,003 --> 01:26:11,089
no maiden since I was thirteen!

1434
01:26:15,093 --> 01:26:16,343
Can't be you.

1435
01:26:16,344 --> 01:26:17,679
No!

1436
01:26:18,346 --> 01:26:20,932
No it was not Billy
who made love to me.

1437
01:26:23,267 --> 01:26:25,937
You were the one who
has defiled this ritual.

1438
01:26:26,646 --> 01:26:28,648
You have broken your
covenant with Satan.

1439
01:26:29,065 --> 01:26:30,483
You have disobeyed.

1440
01:26:30,942 --> 01:26:32,443
I have been commanded.

1441
01:26:32,485 --> 01:26:34,862
There was but one unsoiled
maiden among us.

1442
01:26:34,946 --> 01:26:37,240
For twenty six years
she remained pure

1443
01:26:37,615 --> 01:26:39,784
She awaited her perfect lover.

1444
01:26:40,118 --> 01:26:42,078
She waited her moment of glory.

1445
01:26:42,537 --> 01:26:44,454
She was pre destined to be the bride

1446
01:26:44,455 --> 01:26:46,165
of the ultimate ecstasy

1447
01:26:46,749 --> 01:26:49,502
And you destroyed her
this very afternoon.

1448
01:26:49,544 --> 01:26:52,296
There stands the only one
among us who remained pure.

1449
01:26:52,547 --> 01:26:54,549
The intended bride.

1450
01:26:55,091 --> 01:26:57,051
And you corrupted her.

1451
01:26:57,385 --> 01:27:00,221
You cast your vile
seed into her body.

1452
01:27:00,513 --> 01:27:03,933
Against her will. Against her
destiny you took her

1453
01:27:04,058 --> 01:27:06,728
You toad. You worm.

1454
01:27:06,936 --> 01:27:09,188
You crawling miserable man.

1455
01:27:09,230 --> 01:27:11,148
You viper!

1456
01:27:11,149 --> 01:27:12,483
He has betrayed you.

1457
01:27:12,942 --> 01:27:14,652
He has betrayed our master.

1458
01:27:15,194 --> 01:27:16,487
Seize him!

1459
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:18,573
Seize him!

1460
01:27:18,781 --> 01:27:19,866
Wait!

1461
01:27:20,074 --> 01:27:21,117
Wait!

1462
01:27:22,452 --> 01:27:24,412
I am no high priest!

1463
01:27:27,665 --> 01:27:29,333
And that sound!

1464
01:27:29,834 --> 01:27:32,086
That sound does not
come from Satan!

1465
01:27:32,336 --> 01:27:33,754
It comes from this!

1466
01:27:33,755 --> 01:27:34,881
A machine!

1467
01:27:35,381 --> 01:27:36,549
And you!

1468
01:27:36,966 --> 01:27:38,259
You have no power!

1469
01:27:39,927 --> 01:27:40,678
Wha...?

1470
01:27:41,012 --> 01:27:41,888
What?

1471
01:27:48,019 --> 01:27:50,521
It's only a game sheriff Bub

1472
01:27:51,689 --> 01:27:53,940
You devil from hell!

1473
01:27:53,941 --> 01:27:55,943
Your earthly powers mean nothing

1474
01:27:56,110 --> 01:27:59,113
Prepare now for your
damnation in hell!

1475
01:28:30,353 --> 01:28:38,353
(Chanting)

1476
01:28:47,370 --> 01:28:48,912
One two three four!

1477
01:28:48,913 --> 01:28:52,123
Two bits! Four bits!
Six bits a dollar!

1478
01:28:52,124 --> 01:28:55,294
All for Huskies stand up and holler!

1479
01:28:55,378 --> 01:28:56,879
(Crowd cheering)

1480
01:28:57,964 --> 01:28:59,841
(Cheering)

1481
01:29:10,268 --> 01:29:12,270
- We have a man injured
on the play

1482
01:29:12,562 --> 01:29:14,397

Stevie!

1485
01:29:18,234 --> 01:29:19,652
Oh nuts!

1486
01:29:21,404 --> 01:29:22,613
Oh my god!

1487
01:29:22,780 --> 01:29:24,323
Oh I hope he's alright.

1488
01:29:30,788 --> 01:29:32,039
How bad is it?

1489
01:29:32,456 --> 01:29:35,084
Jesus! Twenty to nothing and
we got to have this happen!

1490
01:29:35,293 --> 01:29:37,043
How bout it son? Tape real tight and be

No way coach! I've had it

1493
01:29:40,131 --> 01:29:41,089
Forget it man!

1494
01:29:41,090 --> 01:29:43,426
You don't get it!
We need this game boy!

1495
01:29:43,801 --> 01:29:45,176
Where's that ole Huskie spirit?

1496
01:29:45,177 --> 01:29:47,513
You can take that Husky
spirit and shove it up your

1497
01:29:50,308 --> 01:29:51,601
You can go on.

1498

You will go on.

1499
01:29:53,144 --> 01:29:56,063
You will go out there and
you will win this game.

1500
01:29:56,814 --> 01:29:57,648

1501
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:03,279

Most likely.

1505
01:30:14,415 --> 01:30:20,587
Touchdown!

1506
01:30:20,588 --> 01:30:21,838
You know I have a feeling

1507
01:30:21,839 --> 01:30:24,466
we're not going to lose
any games this year.

1508
01:30:24,467 --> 01:30:25,967
One two three four!
