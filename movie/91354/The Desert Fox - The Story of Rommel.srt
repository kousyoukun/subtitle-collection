1
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,700
<i>The time is 1941,</i>
<i>a month before Pearl Harbor.</i>

2
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,000
<i>At eleven o'clock, on a November night,</i>

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,700
<i>a British submarine</i>
<i>surfaced in the Mediterranean</i>

4
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:32,600
<i>off the coast of Libya in North Africa,</i>
<i>behind the German lines.</i>

5
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,800
- Are you sure the light carries that far?
- It should.

6
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,100
There they are.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,200
- What's he saying?
- He says they're all set, sir.

8
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,300
Tell him we're coming in.

9
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,200
<i>These were British commandos,</i>

10
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,700
<i>and the purpose of this carefully plotted raid</i>
was the death of one man.</i>

11
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,400
Cover me.

12
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,300
- It's no use. Go on.
- Get hold of my arm.

13
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,400
- It's no use, I tell you. Get out of here.

14
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,800
Did we... Did we get him?

15
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,100
Are you serious, Englishman?

16
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,100
The following order from General Auchinleck

17
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,100
is to all commanders and
chiefs of staff of the Middle East forces.

18
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,000
"There exists a real danger
that our friend Rommel

19
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
is becoming a kind of magician
or bogeyman to our troops,

20
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,800
who are talking far too much about him."

21
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,000
"He is by no means a superman,

22
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,300
although he is undoubtedly
very energetic and able."

23
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,600
"Even if he were a superman,
it would still be highly undesirable

24
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,500
that our men should credit him
with supernatural powers."

25
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,400
"I wish you to dispel by all possible means

26
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:28,200
the idea that Rommel represents something
more than an ordinary German general."

27
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,100
"Ensure that this order
is put into immediate effect,

28
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,400
and impress upon all commanders

29
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,300
that, from a psychological point of view,
it is a matter of the highest importance."

30
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,200
Signed: CJ Auchinleck, General,

31
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,300
Commander-in-Chief, MEF.

32
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,100
<i>This is the North African desert</i>
<i>in June of 1942,</i>

33
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,600
<i>and these are British soldiers</i>
<i>taken prisoner the night before</i>

34
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,400
<i>by units of the German Afrika Korps.</i>

35
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,200
Run, you fool! Run!

36
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,400
You, come on! Get out of there!

37
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,400
Get over with the other prisoners.

38
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,500
Who is the senior officer here?

39
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,400
- I am, I suppose.
- Come with me.

40
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,400
- Rank?
- Lieutenant colonel.

41
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,600
I want you to go with these two officers,
under a flag of truce,

42
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,600
and tell that battery to stop firing.
Tell them they're killing their own men.

43
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,100
- Sorry, I can't do that.
- I'm giving you an order.

44
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,100
Here, tie this on that rifle.

45
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,100
Listen, Major, I'm a prisoner of war.
You can't give me any such order.

46
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,800
- You know that as well as I do.
- I won't argue the point with you.

47
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,400
Either you do as I tell you
or we'll soon find a way to make you.

48
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,400
- Are you going or not?
- Major! Major!

49
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,100
What's the row?

50
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,500
- The field marshal said you're right.
- Field marshal?

51
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,400
<i>So this, then, was Rommel.</i>

52
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:32,100
<i>Erwin Johannes Eugen Rommel,</i>
<i>commander in chief of the enemy army,</i>

53
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,900
<i>and the most celebrated</i>
<i>German soldier since World War I.</i>

54
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,500
<i>Already a legend in the desert,</i>

55
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,500
<i>he was a fox who had chased his hunters</i>
<i>back and forth across North Africa</i>

56
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,600
<i>about as often as they had chased him,</i>

57
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,300
<i>and his tricks and turns</i>
<i>had made even the tommies chuckle,</i>

58
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:57,400
<i>which is scarcely the proper reflex</i>
<i>to the enemy in time of war.</i>

59
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,100
<i>In spite of which, he was still,</i>
<i>of course, my enemy.</i>

60
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,100
<i>The enemy not only of my country</i>
<i>and the army in which I served,</i>

61
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,900
<i>but of all life as I knew it.</i>

62
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,200
<i>Not only of democracy</i>
<i>as free men had fashioned it,</i>

63
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,300
<i>but of civilisation itself.</i>

64
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,300
<i>My name is Desmond Young.</i>

65
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,300
<i>At the time of my capture</i>
<i>I was a lieutenant colonel in the Indian Army.</i>

66
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,800
<i>This was my first and only sight</i>
<i>of the cool, hard professional soldier</i>

67
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,900
<i>whose scrupulous regard for the rules of</i>
<i>warfare had been exercised, in this instance,</i>

68
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,000
<i>so fortunately for myself.</i>

69
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,500
<i>Two years and four months later,</i>

70
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,500
<i>while the British and Americans were</i>
<i>still fighting their way across Europe,</i>

71
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,600
<i>Erwin Rommel was dead.</i>

72
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:51,700
<i>He was dead, the Nazis reported, of wounds</i>
<i>gallantly received on the field of honour.</i>

73
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:56,600
<i>But the Nazis were great liars,</i>
<i>of course, and many people wondered.</i>

74
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,200
<i>For already there were mysterious rumours</i>
<i>floating across the battle lines.</i>

75
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,500
<i>So when the war was over</i>
<i>and my military life behind me,</i>

76
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,900
<i>I gave myself a mission.</i>

77
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,500
<i>I set out to discover what</i>
<i>actually had happened to him.</i>

78
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,200
<i>what was the truth about his death,</i>
<i>and on what field of honour had he died</i>?

79
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:24,500
<i>In a modest home in the tiny village of</i>
<i>Herrlingen by Ulm, in Württemberg, Germany,</i>

80
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,400
<i>I talked long and often</i>
<i>with Rommel's son and widow,</i>

81
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,100
<i>and examined his letters,</i>
<i>reports and other papers.</i>

82
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:38,700
<i>In Germany I talked to soldiers who had</i>
<i>served with him, over him and under him,</i>

83
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,100
<i>in England, with men who</i>
<i>had fought against him,</i>

84
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,100
<i>from field marshals to desert rats.</i>

85
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,100
<i>And in both countries, of course,</i>
<i>I went to the official records.</i>

86
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:55,700
<i>Based on these facts, what now follows</i>
<i>is the true story of Erwin Rommel.</i>

87
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,200
<i>The beginning of the end</i>
<i>for this single-minded soldier</i>

88
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:07,300
<i>came at 9.30 on the evening</i>
<i>of October 23, 1942,</i>

89
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,600
<i>when, at El Alamein,</i>
<i>six miles of British guns...</i>

90
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,600
Fire!

91
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:55,200
<i>I discovered that, actually, Rommel was</i>
<i>not in Africa when the storm of battle broke.</i>

92
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,100
<i>Suffering from a chronic</i>
<i>diphtheria of the nose,</i>

93
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,900
<i>he had been relieved</i>
<i>of his command a month before</i>

94
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,800
<i>and flown back to a hospital in Germany.</i>

95
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,100
<i>But, when the telephone rang at his bedside</i>

96
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,800
<i>and a familiar voice from Berlin</i>
<i>called on him once more,</i>

97
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,800
<i>he rose and was in a plane</i>
<i>on the way back to the desert within hours.</i>

98
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,400
- Thank you. Still the dandy, I see.
- Just luck, sir.

99
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,900
Welcome back, sir.

100
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,000
- Shall we look at those maps?
- Over here.

101
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,700
- How are you, Bayerlein?
- Very well. Did you see Frau Rommel?

102
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,600
Yes, she came and stayed a week,
she and Manfred.

103
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,500
- How does it look today?
- They've simply got too much for us.

104
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,400
I've no idea how we'll get out of it.
Not with the amount of petrol we've got.

105
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,100
- We have petrol.
- Not enough.

106
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,700
- It's still on the way?
- No, nor any prospect of it.

107
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,000
- Who told you that?
- I've talked to Rome three times.

108
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
There's no petrol on the way nor any
committed to us, as of ten o'clock last night.

109
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,800
Schultz. Aldinger.

110
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,200
- The tanks, did they come?
- None.

111
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,700
- None since I left?
- No. None since August.

112
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,800
- What about the guns?
- Nothing.

113
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,000
- And no petrol at all?
- Not a pint.

114
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,400
This is correct within the hour.

115
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,500
Get me a stool, will you?

116
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,200
Here's where it's worst.
The 15th's in a bad way. They drove...

117
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,700
- What's this?
- The Trento Division.

118
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,700
- Yes, I see. How far's this armour?
- No further.

119
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,800
Where are my maps?

120
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,600
Bring the 21st and Ariete north through here.

121
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,700
- Move the 90th and Trento forward here.
- So they'll hook up.

122
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:25,200
- Is Montgomery sending his infantry in first?
- Naturally.

123
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Then the armour? Let's send our tanks in first
and blow a hole through that infantry.

124
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,500
If it works, we'll be on top of his tanks,
with our infantry pouring in to polish it off.

125
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,300
- Very good, sir.
- If it doesn't work we'll know better next time.

126
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,300
You're not going up now, are you?

127
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,400
- Oughtn't you to turn in?
- After three weeks of being turned in?

128
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,100
- We're away, sir.
- Let's head north and go in with the 21st.

129
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:03,500
<i>But there was now another fox in the desert,</i>
<i>an even craftier one, perhaps.</i>

130
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,200
<i>And if the battle boiled into confusion</i>
<i>during the next few days,</i>

131
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,800
<i>it was a confusion that was clearly</i>
<i>more and more in Montgomery's favour.</i>

132
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:01,600
- Have you found the field marshal yet?
- No, sir. He's out at the front again.

133
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,000
I don't know how the men in the line feel,
but I'd just as soon have

134
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
a commander in chief
with a touch of cowardice about him.

135
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,600
Just enough to have him back at
headquarters now and then. Keep after him.

136
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,100
<i>By the tenth day of the battle,</i>

137
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,100
<i>not even Rommel could have</i>
<i>any doubt as to its outcome.</i>

138
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:40,800
There's a limit to this sort of thing. You can't
go on indefinitely until the last man's dead.

139
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,700
It's all very gallant,
but it's also pretty idiotic.

140
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,000
Von Thoma wants to pull back to Daba.

141
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,500
- What about Müller?
- No answer as yet, sir.

142
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,300
- Where are you from?
- Goslar, sir.

143
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:02,000
Really? I was stationed in Goslar once
with a mountain battalion.

144
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,800
- We skied there. Do you know that run?
- Very well, sir.

145
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,300
- Are you any good?
- Well, two years ago...

146
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,400
- He understood I need an immediate answer?
- Yes, sir.

147
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,000
- Are you keeping after Müller?
- Yes, sir.

148
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,200
- Did you try Berlin?
- He'll call if he can.

149
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,400
- Nothing yet, though.
- No, but he knows the situation.

150
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,800
- If there's anything he can do, he will.
- To Berlin, we're a sideshow and you know it.

151
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,300
Well, what?

152
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,100
- Müller's in a bad way.
- How bad?

153
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,900
Very. If he doesn't pull back soon,
he won't have anything to pull back.

154
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,900
- Why can't we get an answer from him?
- His command car's gone. He's in a carrier.

155
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,200
If he's got more than 40 tanks left,
I'd be surprised.

156
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,800
- How about the Italians?
- They've had as much as they can take.

157
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,900
Rome calling, sir.

158
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,200
- Well?
- Field Marshal Kesselring regrets.

159
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,800
Well, that eliminates any
further speculation anyway.

160
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It's now a simple matter of mathematics.

161
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,900
With the petrol we've got left, we have two
choices. We can remain here, be destroyed.

162
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,800
Or we can pull out tonight
and dig in for the next round.

163
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,200
- You think we still can?
- Pull out? Why not?

164
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,200
- Montgomery's got no petrol shortage.
- Montgomery's a very deliberate fellow.

165
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,600
He wouldn't leap after me the way
I'd leap after him. He'd think about it first.

166
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,200
- I don't see what else there is to be done.
- Let's have Plan C.

167
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,200
Notify all commanding officers to stand by
for important orders. If we move...

168
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,200
Berlin calling, sir.

169
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,400
- Who in Berlin?
- The Führer.

170
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,700
Signed: Adolf Hitler.

171
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:02,000
"The situation requires that the El Alamein
position be held to the last man."

172
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
"There is to be no retreat, not so much as
one millimetre. It must be victory or death."

173
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,900
- I can't believe it.
- Still got Berlin? Ask him to repeat that.

174
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,700
I know. But it's not him, I tell you.
It's those hoodlums again.

175
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,500
Those thieves and crooks and murderers.
Those toy soldiers.

176
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Those dummy generals, with their books
and charts and maps and pointers.

177
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,800
How can he listen to such nonentities?
How can he stand the smell of such filth?

178
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,800
Why doesn't he slaughter them
and use his intelligence?

179
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,200
- I have your repeat.
- Go ahead, read it.

180
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,200
"The situation requires that the El Alamein
position be held to the last man."

181
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,600
"There is to be no retreat,
not so much as one millimetre."

182
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,500
"It must be victory or death."
Signed: Adolf Hitler.

183
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,700
- Incredible!
- You won't pay attention to such nonsense?

184
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,600
It's a military order
from general headquarters.

185
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,600
A clear, straight, stupid, criminal
military order from general headquarters.

186
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,500
And what are you going to do?
Double the insanity by obeying it?

187
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,900
We've got the best soldiers in the army.

188
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,700
They may be just hanging on now,
but they're still fighting.

189
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:09,200
If we take them out now, they can fight again
tomorrow. But this? This is sheer madness.

190
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,500
Nobody has said "Victory or death" since
people fought with bows and arrows.

191
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,900
This is an order to throw away an entire army.

192
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:20,900
If I may remind you, sir, here in the field
these men are yours, not his.

193
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,200
- I just can't understand it.
- He's insane.

194
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,800
He's not insane. He's...

195
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,500
But neither am I.

196
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,200
Pull 'em out, Bayerlein.
I'll argue with him about it later.

197
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,000
<i>The end came in Tunis,</i>

198
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,800
<i>when the Axis forces were caught</i>
<i>between the British, the Free French</i>

199
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:28,800
<i>and the Americans under Eisenhower,</i>
<i>and surrendered unconditionally.</i>

200
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,700
<i>But the Afrika Korps went</i>
<i>into captivity without its leader.</i>

201
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,500
<i>For, a month before the end,</i>

202
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,500
<i>Rommel had again fallen ill and been</i>
<i>invalided back to the hospital in Germany.</i>

203
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
- Morning, Sergeant.
- Morning, Frau Rommel. Manfred.

204
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,500
Morning.

205
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,500
- Dr Strolin.
- Karl Strolin, Lord Mayor of Stuttgart.

206
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,800
- An old friend of the field marshal's.
- You'll find him much better this morning.

207
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,300
All he needed was a little rest.

208
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,300
Frau Rommel...

209
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,700
Manfred Rommel...

210
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,300
and Dr Karl Strolin.

211
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,400
From Stuttgart?

212
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,900
Not only from, but lord mayor of.

213
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,900
And don't tell me <i>he's</i> on the list.

214
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,700
Dr Karl Strolin, Lord Mayor of Stuttgart.

215
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,400
She says he's an old friend
of the field marshal.

216
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,500
Nevertheless, here he is.

217
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:56,500
"To be kept under the closest observation
whenever discovered outside Stuttgart."

218
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,500
Not that it could really
be described as an argument.

219
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:07,700
It's impossible to have an argument with him
in the sense that you and I could have one.

220
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,700
He raves. He screams.

221
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:14,400
He goes into such hysterics it's like trying
to make sense with a panic-stricken woman.

222
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,800
He called him a coward.

223
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,800
Did he really use that word to you?

224
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,900
Not once, but several times.

225
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:28,500
In Russia, he said, officers like me
have been put against the wall and shot.

226
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,900
Nor must I think it couldn't happen to me.

227
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:36,100
And that was his thanks. That was his
gratitude for all that Erwin has done for him.

228
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:41,400
But you mustn't hold people accountable for
everything they say when emotionally upset.

229
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,900
The war's not going well
and he's naturally worried.

230
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:51,100
But I'm afraid it'll be a long time before
I forget what he did to the Afrika Korps.

231
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,000
What was that?

232
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
When the end was near,
and I asked him to get them out,

233
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:02,900
he said he had no further interest
or concern in the Afrika Korps.

234
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,900
And that was their thanks.

235
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,500
Rommel, I should like to ask you a question.

236
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,200
If you don't care to answer, I understand,

237
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,200
but, with your permission,
I should like to ask it nevertheless.

238
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,200
What is it?

239
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,100
Do you really believe that we can win?

240
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,400
- I'll tell you what he believes.
- Yes?

241
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,700
He doesn't think so.

242
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,000
He told you that himself?

243
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,300
He did.

244
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,200
And he understands
what that'll mean this time?

245
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,100
Apparently.

246
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,400
Then why do we go on?

247
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,700
Because we have no choice.

248
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:55,800
Because no country we're fighting - England,
America, Russia - will make peace with him.

249
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,300
He admitted that?

250
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,200
And it's the truth, of course.

251
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,600
In other words,
while he remains as leader of Germany

252
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,200
we must fight on until we're destroyed.

253
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,600
Victory or death, as ever.

254
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,600
I take it that he didn't mention
the obvious solution to the situation.

255
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
- What do you mean?
- Abdication.

256
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,900
Now, my dear Strolin...

257
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,600
I'm afraid we must go, dear.

258
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,600
- Already?
- I have a train to catch.

259
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,300
- We'll come back later.
- Let's have coffee.

260
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,900
Goodbye. Good to see you
after all these years.

261
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,400
- We won't let it be so long next time.
- Do you think they really would?

262
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,900
- Would what, son?
- Shoot you.

263
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:46,200
No, no. That's just his wild way of talking.
You mustn't pay any attention to that.

264
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,500
- Shoot his greatest general?
- You shouldn't have said that in front of him.

265
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,000
Come along and stop talking nonsense.

266
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,800
- Until this evening, dear.
- Come early, will you?

267
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
- He's a good-looking boy, isn't he?
- And a very nice boy, too.

268
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,300
- But were you entirely truthful with him?
- About what?

269
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,300
When you told him that
he would never put you up against a wall.

270
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,500
Of course.

271
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,800
Has it ever occurred to you
that he might turn on you?

272
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,000
- Why should he?
- He's turned on others.

273
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,800
He'll never turn on me.

274
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:26,900
What about those round him that don't like
you - Himmler, Bormann and that crowd?

275
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,400
- Don't they ever influence him?
- Very often, indeed.

276
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,600
You don't think they might
influence him against you?

277
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,600
It's possible, yes, but...
I don't see that it's very likely.

278
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,500
But in the remote possibility that they did,

279
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,500
have you ever considered what
might become of Lucy and Manfred?

280
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,900
I've never thought about it.
But what on earth are you getting at anyway?

281
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,200
I think you should, that's all.

282
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:58,800
You haven't changed a bit, Doctor.
You always were something of an odd fish.

283
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,600
But there's no need to worry this time.
We're in no danger, none of us.

284
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,500
And if you'd take some advice from a friend,
you'd better not talk like that to everybody.

285
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,300
I don't.

286
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:13,800
Only to those I know very well
and am very fond of.

287
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,100
- Goodbye, Rommel.
- Goodbye, Strolin. Come again if you can.

288
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,200
I'll try.

289
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:42,200
<i>An invasion of Hitler's European fortress</i>
<i>was now clearly but a matter of time.</i>

290
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:48,200
<i>And in November of 194</i>3<i>, Rommel made</i>
<i>a tour of inspection of the Atlantic defences,</i>

291
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,200
<i>preparatory to taking command</i>
<i>of the Nazi forces</i>

292
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,200
<i>that were gathering to resist the assault.</i>

293
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,800
<i>A month later, Rommel reported</i>
<i>to Field Marshal von Rundstedt,</i>

294
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,500
<i>supreme commander in the west,</i>
<i>at the latter's headquarters</i>

295
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,300
<i>in the Pompadour's Palace</i>
<i>at Fontainebleau outside Paris.</i>

296
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,300
Field Marshal von Rundstedt, gentlemen.

297
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,400
- Ruge.
- Field Marshal.

298
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,500
Gentlemen.

299
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,000
- Good to see you, Rommel.
- Field Marshal.

300
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,200
Well, now that you've examined it closely,
what do you think of our Atlantic Wall?

301
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,300
I'm afraid I haven't quite
completed my report yet, but...

302
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,900
Then we'll discuss it whenever you're ready.

303
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,600
I don't imagine the mighty Eisenhower
will be on us for another day or so anyway.

304
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:07,200
- Wasn't too much a tax on you, I hope.
- Not in the least. I'm entirely recovered.

305
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,200
- I'm delighted. You're well taken care of?
- Yes, sir.

306
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,200
Bauer, would you divert our friends

307
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,700
while Field Marshal Rommel and I
have a few moments of privacy?

308
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,800
Yes, sir.

309
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,600
Appalling, wasn't it?

310
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,600
I can't even see why it's called a wall.

311
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,200
The big ports like Havre and Ostend
and Cherbourg are protected,

312
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,900
but the enemy's not coming in
on the <i>Queen Mary</i>

313
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,300
Nothing's been done about the beaches.

314
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,500
I saw 50 places where
an army of children could come ashore.

315
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:12,600
The trouble is labour. We have the plans
for fortifications the devil couldn't breach -

316
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,200
solid steel and concrete
from Denmark to Spain.

317
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,200
But I'm afraid our French friends aren't
being as cooperative as they might be.

318
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,300
Even when driven to the job,
they move like snails.

319
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:28,000
Either we break it up while they're still
wading ashore or we're in trouble.

320
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,300
- Is that how you'd meet it?
- On the beaches.

321
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,800
Crowd the water
with mines and traps and tricks

322
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,400
and hit 'em while they're trying
to keep themselves from drowning.

323
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,200
Here. Down here.

324
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,800
And here.

325
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
I don't agree with you.

326
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:52,100
As it happens, neither you nor I will
determine the tactics in this operation.

327
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,200
Not above the regimental level anyway.

328
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,400
You mean Berlin?

329
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:02,200
I mean the Bohemian corporal himself is
assuming sole command of this operation.

330
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:08,600
You and I will function simply as instruments
of his astrological inspirations.

331
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,300
And in case you're afflicted with scepticism,
this is official.

332
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,300
- But that's an impossible situation.
- Then you should explain that to him.

333
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,000
You've made no protest yourself?

334
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,400
After you've interfered a dozen times or so
with a man's enthusiastic determination

335
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,400
to cut his own throat, there comes a moment
when you're inclined to stand back

336
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,300
and view it with a certain detachment.

337
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,700
No objection to my pointing this out to him?

338
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:37,700
On the contrary. I bestow my blessings
on your courage and optimism.

339
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,600
I'm told you once referred to me as a clown,
a clown of Hitler's circus.

340
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,300
Oh, did I?

341
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:59,200
If so, I think you should know I've been
more explicit about you many times.

342
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,600
That's quite all right, Field Marshal.

343
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:06,500
I find it almost impossible to keep my mind
on anything harsh said about me.

344
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,300
Did you say it?

345
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:13,800
Whoever said it, you've given him
ample reason to regret such a foolish remark.

346
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,400
- Thank you, Field Marshal.
- Not at all.

347
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,000
- Is there anything else?
- I don't believe so, at the moment.

348
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,800
One suggestion, perhaps...

349
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,700
in view of our cordiality.

350
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,800
If I were you, I wouldn't be
altogether unguarded

351
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,100
about what I had to say about
this new strategic arrangement.

352
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:41,800
You should know that from now on you'll be
under more or less constant observation.

353
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,500
- From Berlin?
- Friends of the management, I believe.

354
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,000
Have you any information
as to why I should be singled out?

355
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,900
Oh, but you're not. We all are.

356
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,500
Apparently, you didn't have it in Africa,

357
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,500
but here on the Continent
it's an honour that goes with staff rank.

358
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:04,600
- You, too?
- My dear fellow, I'm the commander in chief.

359
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:18,400
<i>Two months after that, in February of 1944,</i>

360
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,200
<i>during one of Rommel's</i>
<i>rare absences from the Atlantic frontier,</i>

361
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,200
<i>his old friend Dr Karl Strolin</i>
<i>sought him out again.</i>

362
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,100
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.

363
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,100
Dr Strolin to see
the field marshal and Frau Rommel.

364
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,200
Come in, sir.

365
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,900
Eisenhower won't try it
until spring, of course.

366
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:06,200
- I doubt if I'll get home again before then.
- Are we ready for it?

367
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,300
We will be, I hope.

368
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:17,700
- To your very good health, Doctor.

369
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,300
How do you know this room isn't wired?

370
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,300
Wired? Why should it be wired?

371
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,200
Does Himmler have to have
a reason for wiring a room?

372
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,800
No, I don't suppose he does.

373
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:35,400
But I don't think you have
to worry about this one. Why?

374
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,800
Cos I want to talk to you
without being overheard.

375
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,000
- About what?
- About the Hitler situation.

376
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,800
If this is politics, Strolin,
I don't want to hear it.

377
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,100
You'd rather see Germany destroyed?

378
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,700
It's not a matter I want to discuss, I tell you.

379
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:07,200
And I'm surprised at you.
That's a communist position.

380
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,000
Oh? Is it?

381
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,800
Defeat, against him, all that sort of thing.
You know it is.

382
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,400
Would you call General Beck a communist?

383
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,500
- Of course not.
- Or Carl Goerdeler, Lord Mayor of Leipzig?

384
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,500
- I've never heard that he was.
- What about Falkenhausen?

385
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,900
- No, but...
- What about Heinrich von Stulpnagel?

386
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:29,600
Von Neurath, von Hassel,
are they communists?

387
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:35,500
Are you trying to tell me seriously that
men like that are questioning his leadership?

388
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:39,300
Not just questioning it. They intend to end it.

389
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:44,700
- You mean you've talked to those fellows?
- To them and many others. Not only soldiers.

390
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:48,300
Churchmen, labour leaders, lawyers, doctors.

391
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:53,200
Members of the government, even. Not too
many of them, but sound men every one.

392
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,900
How long has this been going on?

393
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,900
Since '38.

394
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,000
And what exactly are you after?

395
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
One: We want to get rid
of Hitler and his gang.

396
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:13,000
If we are to be defeated, then we prefer to be
defeated as human beings, not as barbarians.

397
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,300
Two: Whether we win or lose,

398
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:20,300
we want to live again
like decent people, without fear.

399
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,900
Look, Strolin, I don't want
to get mixed up in this thing.

400
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,500
What they do in Berlin is their business,
not mine. I'm a soldier, not a politician.

401
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:34,500
- You still think you're perfectly safe?
- Who knows who's safe and who's not?

402
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,300
- Under a sane man you'd know.
- That's a lot of rubbish. And you know it.

403
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:42,000
Well, I hope you're right.
And perhaps you are.

404
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,400
After all, you are his favourite,
and no one's ever questioned

405
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:50,500
the deep and enduring gratitude he's always
shown to those who have served him well.

406
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,900
No one's in danger who does his job properly.

407
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:58,500
Of course, you have nothing to fear.
And if something did happen, unpredictably,

408
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,700
you'd still know that
the lives of Lucy and Manfred

409
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:05,100
would be safe and snug
in the soft, gentle, tender hands

410
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,900
of that brave little band of patriots
he's gathered round him.

411
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:12,900
- That kind of talk doesn't amuse me.
- I'm not trying to amuse you.

412
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:17,200
I'm merely reflecting on
your extraordinary good fortune.

413
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,200
I wish you'd think about that, too, sometime.
Not the blood on his mouth,

414
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,300
but what a godsend he is to you personally,

415
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:27,500
not only in your home,
but in the field as a soldier.

416
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:31,500
How many other generals can boast
the favour and support of a leader

417
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,500
so gifted in the arts of war?

418
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:35,900
That's enough.

419
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:40,200
You haven't forgotten how brilliantly
he refused to be seduced into an invasion

420
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,100
of undefended England right after Dunkirk?

421
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,400
Or how brave he was at Stalingrad,

422
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,300
when von Paulus wanted
to withdraw from the trap?

423
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:54,100
What other man on earth would have had the
courage to send that brief, thrilling command

424
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:59,100
"Don't retreat so much as a millimetre.
Victory or death." Would Napoleon himself...

425
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:03,800
- That's enough, I tell you!
- Afraid even to think about it.

426
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,200
Stop talking to me as if I were a child
and you a schoolmaster!

427
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,900
Don't you think I know what you mean?
But what of it?

428
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,500
Who asked me? And suppose
I told them what I thought -

429
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:17,500
that what they're doing, beyond anything
else, is stupid - who would listen to me?

430
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:21,300
- Have you ever tried?
- Yes! Been told to mind my own business.

431
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:24,800
And who's to say they're not right?
You aren't naive enough to think

432
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,800
that a soldier must approve of
his government before he can fight for it.

433
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,100
What army could exist like that, with every
man free to decide what he will or won't do?

434
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:37,900
The truth is that a soldier
has but one function in life,

435
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:42,700
one lone excuse for existence, and that is
to carry out the order of his superiors.

436
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,500
The rest, including government, is politics.

437
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:50,600
And if I must remind you again, I'm a soldier,
not a politician. What the government does...

438
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,400
Stop hiding behind that
bloody uniform of yours!

439
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,900
What do I care about
your philosophy of the soldier?

440
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,200
All it means to me is that you're terrified,

441
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:02,200
and hiding under a lot of rubbish
about the functions of a robot.

442
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,900
Have you forgotten that
I've known you for 20 years?

443
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:09,300
I know exactly how you feel
about that abomination in Berlin.

444
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,900
What I can't understand is this willingness

445
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:15,900
to go marching right down into hell
with a beast you loathe and despise.

446
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:21,100
Where's all the sense and courage you have
in the field? Haven't you any of it here?

447
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:24,500
I think you'd better
get out of this house. Now.

448
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Not until you've shown an old friend
the decency of honesty with him.

449
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,900
If reason won't work -
very well, then, I'm prepared to go further.

450
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:38,900
I won't stir from this room
until the truth has passed between us.

451
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,700
Or had you rather
I call the guard and charge you?

452
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:46,600
- That you will never do.
- And may I ask why you know what I will do?

453
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,300
Because Lucy told me that you wouldn't.

454
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
You... You've already
talked to Lucy about this?

455
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,400
Of course.

456
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,300
- And she sent you to me?
- Not at all.

457
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:05,900
She merely told me how you really feel
about our sainted leader

458
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,700
and his glorious reign over Germany.

459
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,500
Father! Father, the car's here.

460
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:27,700
We saw it. Will you please not shout?
I've told you that a dozen times.

461
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,400
- He's just excited.
- I know, but...

462
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:35,400
He's all right. He's still only a boy,
remember, in spite of that uniform.

463
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,600
Of course.

464
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,200
Take care of yourself, dear.

465
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,900
- You're not cross with me, are you?
- For what?

466
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:46,700
For speaking to Dr Strolin.

467
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,700
No, of course not.

468
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,400
Is he right?

469
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,800
I don't know.

470
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,400
I can't make up my mind.

471
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,100
But that's a dreadful thing he proposes.

472
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:14,600
A great, tremendous, dreadful thing. I don't
know that I can go along that far with him.

473
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:19,700
- Then don't, if you don't think he's right.
- I didn't say he wasn't right, but...

474
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:23,400
Even so, is that the only way to handle it?

475
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,500
Treason?

476
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:30,300
That's what it comes down to,
no matter how right you think you are.

477
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:33,000
You think it's better
to keep things as they are?

478
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,800
No, no, I don't. But there must be
some better way of handling it.

479
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:42,200
I mean, if I could see him alone again
and explain the situation to him.

480
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:47,000
Can you tell me how a man can
fight a war under such conditions?

481
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,600
Isn't it enough that we face an invasion...

482
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,500
No. Never mind now.

483
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:56,000
You don't have to decide this minute.
It'll come to you when it's time.

484
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:01,100
What do <i>you</i> think, really?

485
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:04,400
I can't tell you, dear. I don't know.

486
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:09,500
But never mind now. When the time comes,
something'll tell you.

487
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,600
You'd better go along now.
You're late already.

488
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:18,300
- Write to me every day, will you?
- I will.

489
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:22,300
- This is a little something for the journey.
- Thank you, darling.

490
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:27,500
Goodbye, sweetheart.
And don't worry about me.

491
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,500
I'll try not to.

492
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,600
That's all, please.

493
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,200
Goodbye, son. Take care of your mother.

494
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:59,100
Be a good soldier. Make me proud of you.

495
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:03,000
I'll try, Father. Are you going
to bring us back Montgomery?

496
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,900
The minute he steps ashore.

497
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:10,900
Goodbye, darling.

498
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,800
<i>And then, finally,</i>
<i>after four long years of preparation,</i>

499
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:30,100
<i>it came: D-day.</i>

500
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:34,000
<i>And the greatest armada and</i>
<i>the vastest movement of men and arms</i>

501
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,200
<i>in the history of the world rose from England</i>

502
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,200
<i>and set out for the assault</i>
<i>on the beaches of Normandy</i>

503
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,700
<i>and the German fortress of Europe.</i>

504
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:51,700
From the moment the Bohemian corporal
promoted himself to the supreme command,

505
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:55,300
the German Army has been
the victim of a unique situation.

506
00:53:56,100 --> 00:54:01,300
Not only too many of the enemy,
but one too many Germans.

507
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:06,100
You don't think he's ready
to give us the 15th Army yet?

508
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,700
I don't see how he can
under the circumstances.

509
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:11,900
His astrologers have informed him
that this is only a feint,

510
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:15,400
that the real invasion is yet to come,
north of Calais.

511
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,900
The 15th Army is sitting
on those cold beaches up there.

512
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:25,100
Waiting for an invasion that has taken place
is an excellent example of war by horoscope.

513
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:27,500
We've got to have those troops.

514
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:32,200
If we're not allowed to manoeuvre, we've
got to be able to support these positions.

515
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,700
We've got to see him again about it.

516
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:37,500
I tell you this in confidence, Rommel.

517
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:41,500
I don't think anything we can do
would be of the slightest use.

518
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,700
The pattern for defeat has already been set.

519
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,900
"Hold fast.
Don't give up a millimetre of ground."

520
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,900
"Victory or death."

521
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:58,100
Wars can't be won by men whose knowledge
of tactics is based on copybook maxims.

522
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:03,100
They may stir schoolchildren,
but they don't stop troops.

523
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:07,100
But give me a free hand for a few months
and I'd make them pay for it.

524
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:12,600
I'd make them pay such a price in blood
they'd wish they'd never heard of Germany.

525
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,900
I might not be able to stop them all,

526
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:19,600
but they'd know they'd fought an army,
not a series of stationary targets.

527
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:26,100
He'll never let us, of course.
You know how firm corporals are.

528
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,700
Do you happen to know Karl Strolin?

529
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:01,400
- Strolin?
- The Lord Mayor of Stuttgart.

530
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,200
I remember that name from somewhere.

531
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,800
Or Dr Goerdeler of Leipzig?

532
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,700
You too?

533
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:18,800
Every day that passes,
every minute of the day,

534
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:23,400
convinces me more and more
that theirs is the only possible solution.

535
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,200
Your words,
you must understand, mystify me.

536
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,800
They propose to arrest him,
take over the government

537
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:32,800
and move immediately
to make peace with Eisenhower.

538
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:36,200
I shall, of course, deny that
this conversation ever took place.

539
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:41,500
But that's a particularly childish idea.
Eisenhower won't make a separate peace.

540
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:44,700
And why should he,
with things going so well as they are?

541
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:47,500
That part of your plan
is doomed from the start.

542
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,600
But you don't disagree
with the basic proposal?

543
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:53,400
I'm sorry, but I don't believe
I heard the question.

544
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:58,100
In any case, if they came to you for counsel
or advice, would you receive them?

545
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,500
Oh, no.

546
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,600
No.

547
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,700
No, I'm afraid not, Rommel.

548
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:09,600
It's too late. Much too late.

549
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,200
Even if they moved immediately?

550
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,700
You misunderstand.

551
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:18,600
Not too late for that.

552
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,700
Too late for me.

553
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,900
I'm 70 now,

554
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,200
too old to revolt,

555
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,700
too old to challenge authority...
however evil.

556
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,800
Berlin calling, sir. Marshal Keitel.

557
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:56,100
Keitel?

558
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:58,500
- Von Rundstedt?
- <i>Here.</i>

559
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:01,900
- Is this true about Cherbourg?
- <i>I'm afraid so.</i>

560
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:05,500
But this is dreadful.
How can I give such news to the Führer?

561
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:09,500
You've reported misfortune to him before.
Why should this be such a problem?

562
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:13,400
But that's just it. We've had nothing
but bad news for weeks.

563
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:16,300
Isn't there any good news
I can give him at the same time?

564
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:18,700
<i>Have you checked on the Russian front</i>?

565
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:22,500
We're not discussing the Russian front.
We're discussing yours.

566
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,700
<i>This situation in the west</i>
<i>becomes worse with every report.</i>

567
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:30,300
I'm actually embarrassed to have to give him
another disappointment like this.

568
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:32,200
Can't you think of anything we can do?

569
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:37,600
Certainly. Give us those 90 divisions of the
15th Army who are in Calais playing cards.

570
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:42,400
That's impossible. The Führer has explained
the necessity for leaving them there.

571
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:47,300
Very well. Give us permission to pull out of
Normandy and set up a line we can defend.

572
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:51,300
Your orders are to fight where you are.
That's what he expects you to do.

573
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,800
You have no better suggestion than that?

574
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,800
One very much better, in fact.

575
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,800
Make peace, you idiot!

576
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,600
- Goodbye again, Rommel.
- He'll never report that.

577
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:29,500
This very instant he's knocking at the
corporal's door, whimpering with happiness.

578
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:32,100
You must never forget this, my dear fellow.

579
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:35,700
Victory has a hundred fathers:
Defeat is an orphan.

580
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:41,900
Within 24 hours you'll be named my
successor. I extend my deepest sympathy.

581
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:44,500
That's nonsense. He'll never let you go.

582
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:55,900
But not too old, I might add,

583
00:59:55,900 --> 01:00:00,900
to wish your friends the best of luck
in their extremely interesting project.

584
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:09,400
<i>Meanwhile, with their beachheads</i>
<i>irretrievably secured,</i>

585
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:15,200
<i>Allied tanks and men had fanned out across</i>
<i>France and begun their race for the Rhine.</i>

586
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:56,200
Put these where you can get to them quickly.
Also those files there.

587
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:00,100
Keep the key yourself and use
your own judgement about the rest.

588
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:03,300
Field Marshal.

589
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:34,100
- Where is he?
- In the small room.

590
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,800
- Aldinger.
- Yes, sir.

591
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,100
Colonel.

592
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:50,900
I'll try to be as brief
as possible, Field Marshal.

593
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:53,900
- You'd better keep an eye on the corridor.
- Yes, sir.

594
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:05,300
- Well?
- We are faced with an immediate decision.

595
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:09,900
Three of our men were arrested in Berlin
yesterday. They'll be made to talk, of course.

596
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:13,600
But, fortunately, their knowledge
of the people involved is limited.

597
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:17,400
But in the opinion of everyone concerned,
there's no more time to be lost.

598
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,800
We must act at once.

599
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,600
And it's all set, definitely?

600
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:24,900
So I understand, sir.

601
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:33,700
At my word, from this instant,
they are prepared to follow my lead.

602
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:36,800
Then I have your permission
to inform General Stulpnagel

603
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:40,700
we may now act at will
and without further consultation?

604
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:46,700
Wait here, Colonel. Come with me, Ruge.

605
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,600
- Clear this room, Aldinger.
- Yes, sir.

606
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:58,300
Outside. Never mind about that. Outside.

607
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:05,300
Field Marshal Rommel speaking.
Put me through to Field Marshal Keitel.

608
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:11,600
I've got to be certain, absolutely certain.

609
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:14,700
We can't go through with this
if there's a remote sign of sense.

610
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,400
<i>Keitel</i>?

611
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,800
- Rommel.
- <i>Now listen very carefully, Keitel.</i>

612
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:29,100
I've got to see the Führer at once,
somewhere in France.

613
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:34,100
I can't explain now, but you must make him
understand that it's a matter of great urgency.

614
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:36,400
I suggest tomorrow morning.

615
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,500
O<i>n June 1</i>7<i>,</i>

616
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:43,200
<i>they met in Hitler's underground stronghold</i>
<i>at Margival, near Soissons.</i>

617
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:49,300
This is an extremely difficult duty, my Führer,
but circumstances leave me with no choice.

618
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:52,900
We've reached a crisis on this front
that calls for a decision.

619
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:56,300
But you've said that. You've said that before.

620
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:58,800
Every time we talk,
we're facing another crisis.

621
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:02,800
When the enemy has overwhelming
superiority on land, at sea and in the air,

622
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:07,300
and continues to grow stronger with every
hour while we grow weaker at the same rate,

623
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:11,400
that to me is a crisis
by any standards that I understand.

624
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:16,900
- A crisis that should be examined promptly.
- That's you! That's you, like always.

625
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:20,200
When everything's going well, you're willing.

626
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:25,200
But at the first sign of a difficulty,
you become a defeatist, complete defeatist.

627
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:30,600
Are you perhaps interested why you didn't
succeed von Rundstedt? This is why!

628
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:36,200
Maybe I'd have been better
if I had replaced you altogether.

629
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,600
Have you, perhaps, a little confidence in me?

630
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:44,400
More, it would seem, than the Führer
has in me. May I continue?

631
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,700
And what my V bombs are doing to London,
has no one told you?

632
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:50,900
Yes, sir. But why not to the beachheads?

633
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:56,300
Because that's not their purpose. They need a
whole city for a target, then they cannot miss.

634
01:04:56,300 --> 01:05:00,200
Then why not the embarkation ports?
Plymouth, Southampton, Portsmouth?

635
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,000
No, no, no, no, no!

636
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:07,400
That's exactly what I mean when I say you're
no good at thinking above the battlefield.

637
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:12,900
The British don't care for those villages.
It's their London that they love.

638
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,300
They don't want to see it destroyed
the way I'll destroy it.

639
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:22,000
In two more weeks, remember my words,
they'll be screaming for surrender. You'll see.

640
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:27,200
To continue, sir.
The struggle is over on this front.

641
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,000
Within two weeks,
you must prepare to see the enemy

642
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,600
break through our lines
and push out into the interior of France.

643
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:38,300
Militarily, the end is already in sight.
We have nothing more to throw in.

644
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:43,200
What is it you are proposing?
That we surrender?

645
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:47,900
I give you the facts, sir. I only ask
that you draw the proper conclusions.

646
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:50,300
Proper to whom? To you!

647
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:01,800
I suggest, Rommel, that
you confine your genius to fighting.

648
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:05,900
Leave the conduct of the war
to those who are responsible for it!

649
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:10,700
My apologies, sir. Now, if the Führer
will honour me with his advice.

650
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:15,900
The V weapon, for your information, happens
to be only the first in a series of weapons

651
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:19,100
that will completely revolutionise all warfare.

652
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:24,900
I've a second more powerful, and a third
in mind a thousand times more destructive.

653
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:27,200
But the crisis under discussion is now.

654
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:31,200
I've a dozen others, all of them capable
of turning the whole course of the war.

655
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:34,900
But what about now, sir?
What are we to do tomorrow morning?

656
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:41,000
While you've been deciding that all is lost,
we've been working, working miracles,

657
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,300
determining the course of history
for centuries to come!

658
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:48,200
In the workshops and laboratories,
we've made machines of destruction

659
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:51,200
such as the enemy has never dreamed of!

660
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:55,200
I have one in mind! I have a weapon in mind!

661
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:04,200
<i>Now definitely committed to</i>
<i>the plot to assassinate his Führer,</i>

662
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,900
<i>Rommel was still trying</i>
<i>to whip fight into his crumbling front,</i>

663
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:13,400
<i>when, on June 17, on a road near a village</i>
<i>with the ominous name of Montgomery...</i>

664
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,600
Aircraft.

665
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:13,100
<i>Three days later, while Rommel still lay</i>
<i>unconscious in a hospital in France,</i>

666
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:16,900
<i>Adolf Hitler and his staff</i>
<i>gathered for their fateful conference</i>

667
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:20,800
<i>in a fortified barracks at</i>
<i>his headquarters in East Prussia.</i>

668
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:07,100
The Führer, gentlemen.

669
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:13,200
He handles his panzers like a cavalry officer.

670
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:15,900
Thank you, gentlemen.

671
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:23,400
- My Führer.
- Yes?

672
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,300
- Stauffenberg, sir.
- Yes, yes.

673
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:28,400
- Stauffenberg. From General Fromm.
- Yes, sir.

674
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:31,500
- Good to see you again.
- Thank you, my Führer.

675
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,800
Gentlemen, your attention, please.

676
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:39,300
Excuse me, please.
I have a report from General Fromm.

677
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,800
- Where's Göring?
- On his way now, sir.

678
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:56,600
Well, when you are fat,
you don't move so fast, huh?

679
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,900
Colonel Count von Stauffenberg?
Telephone, sir.

680
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:05,900
Thank you.

681
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:12,200
Excuse me.

682
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:34,200
All right, suppose we start
with the Russian front.

683
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:02,100
Führer?

684
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:04,800
The Führer!

685
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,100
Are you all right, my Führer?

686
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,000
Yeah. I'm all right.

687
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:42,400
<i>For that failure, 5000 suspects</i>
<i>paid with their lives</i>

688
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:46,000
<i>during the few days</i>
<i>that Hitler spent in hospital.</i>

689
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,300
<i>As for Rommel, recuperating</i>
<i>at Herrlingen from injuries</i>

690
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:52,500
<i>that would have destroyed</i>
<i>any but the toughest of men,</i>

691
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:55,500
<i>all public mention of his name</i>
<i>suddenly stopped,</i>

692
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:58,600
<i>and a complete and official silence</i>
<i>settled over the subject</i>

693
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:01,900
<i>of the nation's most celebrated soldier.</i>

694
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:05,300
<i>For three months he remained</i>
<i>in this sinister isolation</i>

695
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:09,300
<i>until the afternoon of</i> October 13 in 1944.</i>

696
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,700
- Keitel?
- <i>How are you, Rommel</i>?

697
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:16,700
- Getting along, thank you.
- Well enough yet to come up to Berlin?

698
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:21,000
I'm afraid not yet.
In another week or two, perhaps. Why?

699
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,800
<i>I could send a special train for you.</i>

700
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:27,400
That's very good of you,
but I really don't feel up to it yet.

701
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:30,000
Is there some particular urgency about it?

702
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,800
<i>How soon will you be ready</i>
<i>for another command</i>?

703
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:36,600
Another two weeks, I suppose.
Three at the most.

704
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:41,300
If we send someone there, would you
be able to discuss the situation with him?

705
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:45,700
- <i>Of course.</i>
- Very well. I'll send Burgdorf. You know him?

706
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:47,700
I've met him.

707
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:51,900
<i>Suppose I have him drive down tomorrow</i>
<i>morning, would that be convenient</i>?

708
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,900
- Perfectly.
- He'll have full information and instructions.

709
01:12:55,900 --> 01:13:00,900
- Give my best regards to Frau Rommel.
- I will. And thank you very much.

710
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:03,000
- <i>Goodbye, then.</i>
- Goodbye.

711
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:26,100
Keitel. He's talking about
another command again.

712
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:30,700
- When?
- When I feel like it, I suppose.

713
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,900
Uh, he sends his best regards to you.

714
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:42,700
- We're here to see Field Marshal Rommel.
- I'll tell him, sir.

715
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:44,900
- Would you tell him...
- Come in, Burgdorf.

716
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:57,300
- Field Marshal.
- It's good to see you again. And you, General.

717
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:00,200
- I don't believe you've met my wife.
- No, sir.

718
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,700
May I present General Burgdorf
and General...?

719
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:04,300
- Maisel.
- General Maisel.

720
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:08,300
- My son Manfred and Captain Aldinger.
- I hope you're not too tired.

721
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:12,000
- Not at all, thank you.
- Have you time for luncheon first?

722
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,400
Thank you, but we're due back
as quickly as we can make it.

723
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:18,400
Very well, then.
If you'll excuse us, dear. This way.

724
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:21,800
- Our apologies.
- Of course, but I'm terribly disappointed.

725
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:24,300
- Another time, perhaps.
- I hope so.

726
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:41,700
I hope it's the Russian front, don't you?

727
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:48,500
Make yourselves comfortable.

728
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:53,800
Smoke, if you wish. I'm not like Montgomery -
smoke doesn't make me unhappy.

729
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:01,200
At your service, gentlemen.

730
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:05,200
- We come directly from the Führer.
- Yes.

731
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:08,900
And what we have to say to you
comes directly from his lips.

732
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:10,400
Yes?

733
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,400
Our instructions are to tell you, first,

734
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:19,200
of his deep appreciation of your
many heroic services to the state.

735
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:22,700
Go on.

736
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:25,900
And his regrets over
your unfortunate accident.

737
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:31,000
I was sure his silence meant only that there
were more important matters on his mind.

738
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:34,600
It's a pity that after such a record...

739
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:39,800
If you'll forgive me, may we skip your
reflections and get to the message you have?

740
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:41,800
Of course, sir.

741
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:12,400
You'll observe that the charges are supported
by an overwhelming body of testimony.

742
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,900
I can read, thank you.

743
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:28,500
You've been uncommonly fortunate,
I see, in deathbed confessions.

744
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:32,000
It's all perfectly legal, I assure you, sir.

745
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:49,400
You may inform the Führer that I look forward
to answering these charges in court.

746
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:52,500
You don't intend to deny them, do you?

747
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:57,800
I said you may inform the Führer that I look
forward to answering the charges in court.

748
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:02,000
The Führer is extremely hopeful
that this matter can be settled

749
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:06,300
without exposing it to
the inevitable publicity of a court trial.

750
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:09,200
Very well, then.
Let him withdraw the charges.

751
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:13,200
His view is that nothing but harm
for everyone could come from a trial.

752
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:17,600
My orders are to remind you,
in the strongest terms possible,

753
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:22,200
of the damage that testimony like this
could do to your name and reputation.

754
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:25,600
What does he expect me to do?
Plead guilty? To you?

755
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:28,600
Well, naturally not that, of course.

756
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:32,600
I know what he wants.
He wants me to keep my mouth shut.

757
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:35,600
He doesn't want me to speak out
where it can be heard.

758
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,200
Well, you may tell him for me that
that's very thoughtful of him,

759
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:46,400
which will be in a proper court of law.

760
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:51,000
But to what end, sir?
The verdict is already indicated.

761
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,300
He told you to tell me that, too?

762
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,500
The evidence is there.
What defence is possible?

763
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:05,600
Then... what does he suggest?

764
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,000
Before we go any further,

765
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,800
the field marshal should be warned
that this house is surrounded.

766
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:16,800
- My orders, sir. I'm sure you understand.
- And both of us are armed.

767
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:19,600
What does he want done?

768
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:23,100
His belief is that it would be
to the best interests of all

769
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:29,200
if you should see fit to relieve the situation
yourself, quietly and without delay.

770
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,300
Go on.

771
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:37,700
The advantages of a solution like that over an
exchange of recriminations in an open court

772
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:40,700
are, in his opinion, several and obvious.

773
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:47,100
Most important to him, of course, would be
the preservation of your name and fame.

774
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:52,000
And he would see to it that no suspicion
would be attached to the way of your going.

775
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:58,200
As far as the rest of the nation would know,
you succumbed finally to your war wounds.

776
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:00,900
That would be the official announcement.

777
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:05,700
And the state would then honour
your memory and your family as well,

778
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:08,200
with a generosity that would be historic.

779
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:11,200
That was his word - "historic".

780
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:15,200
Your name would live on
in the glory it once deserved,

781
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:21,100
while your wife and son would never want for
either safety or comfort as long as they live.

782
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:26,800
- I have a choice?
- In a sense, yes.

783
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:32,000
The choice to die now or later.

784
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,500
It amounts to that, I'm afraid.

785
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,900
How long have I to make this choice?

786
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:43,400
We're due back in Berlin
as early this evening as we can make it.

787
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:52,300
Death by strangulation.

788
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:57,500
The drug I have brought with me
is effective in three seconds and painless.

789
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:17,400
Tell him for me

790
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:21,400
that in spite of the disadvantages
you've been kind enough to point out,

791
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:24,000
I'll take the trial.

792
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:29,100
It may be, as you say, a futile defence,
but I think it should be heard nevertheless.

793
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:32,500
There might be some value in it
for those who hear it.

794
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:38,300
It might even move some to stop and think
for a moment or two, as finally I did,

795
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,800
though unfortunately too late.

796
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:45,400
In any case, it's my life, and that's my choice.

797
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:50,000
I confess my disappointment
with your choice, sir.

798
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,800
My heart, of course, bleeds for you.

799
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:57,600
The unfortunate part of it is
that if you insist on a trial,

800
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:03,000
I have no authority to offer any guarantees
for the safety and comfort of your son...

801
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:06,100
and widow.

802
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,700
They're coming out now.

803
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,800
- All over, sir?
- I believe so.

804
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:38,300
- We'll wait outside, sir.
- I won't be long.

805
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:42,200
Well, we hardly expected such a...

806
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:50,200
- Over already?
- Wait there. I'll be down in a few moments.

807
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,600
What is it, Erwin?

808
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:05,400
I want you to be strong, darling.

809
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:08,500
I want you to be very strong and very brave.

810
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:12,400
Do you understand?

811
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,300
Yes.

812
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:18,100
I've got to go away now, and I won't be back.

813
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:22,500
Do you want me to tell you any more?

814
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:24,600
There's no way out?

815
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,700
No. But it won't be too terrible.

816
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:31,700
They're giving me a drug.
It's painless and effective immediately.

817
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:36,900
We're leaving now
and I'll do it as quickly as possible.

818
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,500
We've got guns. Can't we make a break for it?

819
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:43,500
No. There's nothing that can be done.
They've thought of everything.

820
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,600
Well, at least we could get them.

821
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:55,200
There's nothing to be done, I tell you.
I've got to do exactly as they say.

822
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:00,700
Yes, sir.

823
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:07,500
Are you going to be brave now?

824
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:09,600
I don't know.

825
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:13,400
You and Manfred will be all right.
They've assured me of that.

826
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:16,300
And nobody's to know about this but us.

827
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:19,400
Are you sure there's no other way?

828
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:21,400
No other, darling.

829
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,700
- Have you told Manfred yet?
- I'll tell him when I go down.

830
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:29,200
No. Let me tell him.

831
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:33,200
I can tell him so much better.

832
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:36,400
If you wish.

833
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:53,500
I'll get my coat now.
It's cold and I don't want to shiver.

834
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:13,500
The field marshal's coming out now.

835
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:27,400
- You're going now?
- Why not?

836
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:32,400
But are you well enough?

837
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:36,100
Of course. I've just been taking it easy
on you and your mother.

838
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:38,200
Is it Russia?

839
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:46,000
Goodbye, Aldinger, old dear friend.

840
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,600
Goodbye, sir.

841
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:50,600
Take care of them.

842
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:52,500
Yes, sir.

843
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,800
Can't you tell me?

844
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:59,700
Don't ask so many questions.
You know better than to talk like that.

845
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:03,100
- But when will we know?
- Before very long.

846
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:09,300
- Goodbye, son. Be a good boy.
- Goodbye, Father.

847
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:12,100
You'll stop them, won't you?

848
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:14,200
We'll see.

849
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:25,600
Goodbye, darling.

850
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:28,600
Goodbye, dear.

851
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:46,500
<i>During that last short ride,</i>
<i>what may Rommel's thoughts have been</i>?

852
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:51,300
<i>were they bitter - that he had learned</i>
<i>too slowly and struck too late</i>?

853
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:56,600
<i>Or did they go back to the desert, where his</i>
<i>military genius had first electrified the world</i>?

854
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:59,600
<i>First at Mechili.</i>

855
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,800
<i>Then Tobruk.</i>

856
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:09,900
<i>Yes, and even El Alamein.</i>

857
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:18,600
<i>In any case, his life and fate have best</i>
<i>been summed up, ironically enough,</i>

858
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:22,200
<i>in the words of Nazi Germany's</i>
<i>sternest enemy,</i>

859
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:24,900
<i>the Honourable Winston Churchill.</i>

860
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:30,500
<i>His ardour and daring</i>
<i>inflicted grievous disasters upon us,</i>

861
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:35,800
<i>but he deserves the salute which</i>
<i>I made him in the House of Commons</i>

862
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:38,700
<i>in January <i>1942.</i>

863
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:46,500
<i>He also deserves our respect</i>
<i>because, although a loyal German soldier,</i>

864
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:50,000
<i>he came to hate Hitler and all his works,</i>

865
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:54,700
<i>and took part in the conspiracy</i>
<i>to rescue Germany</i>

866
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:58,900
<i>by displacing the maniac and tyrant.</i>

867
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:03,800
<i>For this, he paid the forfeit of his life.</i>

868
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:08,600
<i>In the sombre wars of modern democracy,</i>

869
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:11,700
<i>there is little place for chivalry.</i>
