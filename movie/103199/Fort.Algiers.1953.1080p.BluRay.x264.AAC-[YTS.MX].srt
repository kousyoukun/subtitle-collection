00:01:03,373 --> 00:01:04,206
- Victory!

5
00:01:05,158 --> 00:01:06,575
The fort is ours!

6
00:01:07,414 --> 00:01:10,164
(dramatic music)

7
00:01:32,882 --> 00:01:34,869
Our victory is complete, Excellency.

8
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:37,738
The last resistance has been crushed.

9
00:01:37,738 --> 00:01:41,953
- Make sure no Legionnaire is left alive.

10
00:01:41,953 --> 00:01:44,371
The French will wonder
a long time at this.

11
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:47,121
(dramatic music)

12
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:49,693
Take that flag down.

13
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,291
And Yessouf,

14
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:54,031
assemble my men at the
usual place tonight.

15
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,781
(dramatic music)

16
00:02:27,718 --> 00:02:28,886
You have done well!

17
00:02:28,886 --> 00:02:31,469
(men cheering)

18
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,300
I charge you to keep this secret.

19
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,532
Let no man speak of what has been done

20
00:02:39,532 --> 00:02:41,210
under penalty of death.

21
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,489
(men chattering)

22
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:46,239
(dramatic music)

23
00:03:25,984 --> 00:03:27,891
- But French Intelligence
doesn't seem to understand

24
00:03:27,891 --> 00:03:30,362
the feelings of a woman.

25
00:03:30,362 --> 00:03:33,047
With my own life torn apart and

26
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,264
now my brother killed,

27
00:03:34,264 --> 00:03:36,586
I feel I've sacrificed enough for France.

28
00:03:36,586 --> 00:03:37,708
- But you must realize that--

29
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,359
- No, General.

30
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:42,240
I cannot bring myself to
accept another assignment.

31
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,895
I will not leave Paris.

32
00:03:43,895 --> 00:03:46,161
- But this is a very urgent
matter, Mademoiselle.

33
00:03:46,161 --> 00:03:48,165
- You know the people,
you know the country,

34
00:03:48,165 --> 00:03:50,059
their customs, their language.

35
00:03:50,059 --> 00:03:51,999
You can't let us down.

36
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:54,038
- Intelligence let me down.

37
00:03:54,038 --> 00:03:56,499
They gave up the search
long ago, but I didn't.

38
00:03:56,499 --> 00:03:58,484
And I never will.

39
00:03:58,484 --> 00:04:01,227
- We've tried very hard
to locate Captain Norton.

40
00:04:01,227 --> 00:04:03,834
We understand how you feel, Mademoiselle.

41
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:04,667
- No.

42
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:07,802
No man can really understand
a woman who's lost

43
00:04:07,802 --> 00:04:10,135
the only man she ever loved.

44
00:04:11,258 --> 00:04:15,109
I wish I could help you,
General, but I can't.

45
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:17,859
(dramatic music)

46
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,514
- Mademoiselle will reconsider.

47
00:04:33,514 --> 00:04:36,264
(dramatic music)

48
00:04:50,102 --> 00:04:51,185
- [Man] Well?

49
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,121
- I'm sorry.

50
00:04:53,121 --> 00:04:54,689
I get paid to work here, you know.

51
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:56,606
I can't leave with you.

52
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:58,675
- Suppose I persuade the management

53
00:04:58,675 --> 00:05:00,774
to let you have the evening off?

54
00:05:00,774 --> 00:05:01,731
- Oh, no.

55
00:05:01,731 --> 00:05:02,697
No, I couldn't.

56
00:05:02,697 --> 00:05:03,530
- Why not?

57
00:05:05,047 --> 00:05:10,047
- Because I'm an artiste and
I never miss a performance.

58
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,217
- I don't quite understand you.

59
00:05:13,217 --> 00:05:16,369
Why do you work in a place like this?

60
00:05:16,369 --> 00:05:19,080
- Uh-oh, that's my cue.

61
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,199
I've got to change now.

62
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,699
(piano music)

63
00:05:29,678 --> 00:05:30,511
- Hey.

64
00:05:30,511 --> 00:05:32,537
You'll be here tomorrow night, no?

65
00:05:32,537 --> 00:05:34,979
Aha. (laughs)

66
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,479
(piano music)

67
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,375
Well, um, Jeff!

68
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,567
- Hello, Chavez, how are you? (laughs)

69
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:43,992
- What are you doing here?

70
00:05:43,992 --> 00:05:45,832
- Hey, that stuff is
gonna kill you in the end.

71
00:05:45,832 --> 00:05:47,457
- In the end, who cares?

72
00:05:47,457 --> 00:05:48,313
- Two of the same.

73
00:05:48,313 --> 00:05:51,360
- Frances, you heard me talk
about my good friend Jeff, no?

74
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,563
- How are you?

75
00:05:52,563 --> 00:05:54,694
- I thought you was at Sidi Bel Razeer.

76
00:05:54,694 --> 00:05:55,527
What are you doing here?

77
00:05:55,527 --> 00:05:56,360
You got a leave?

78
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,470
- No, a transfer.

79
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,303
- Transfer?

80
00:05:58,303 --> 00:05:59,136
- Mm-hmm.

81
00:05:59,136 --> 00:05:59,969
To an outfit down here.

82
00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:00,802
Report in the morning.

83
00:06:00,802 --> 00:06:02,420
- Say, everybody's getting
transferred down here

84
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,878
all of a sudden.

85
00:06:03,878 --> 00:06:04,711
What's going on?

86
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:05,743
- I don't know.

87
00:06:05,743 --> 00:06:06,576
Ask the General.

88
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:07,409
(all laugh)

89
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,698
- Ask the General! (laughs)

90
00:06:09,698 --> 00:06:11,257
- Hey, I want you to meet Sandra.

91
00:06:11,257 --> 00:06:13,416
Prettiest girl in North Africa.

92
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:14,522
- Hello.

93
00:06:14,522 --> 00:06:16,097
- How do you do?

94
00:06:16,097 --> 00:06:19,097

His Excellency wouldn't like it.

- [Chavez] His Excellency?

102
00:07:21,782 --> 00:07:23,064

(Bal-musette music)

132
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,543
- Jeff!

133
00:09:17,543 --> 00:09:18,600
Come with me for a minute.

134
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,474
I've got to see you.

135
00:09:19,474 --> 00:09:20,943
- Sorry, I'm busy.

136
00:09:20,943 --> 00:09:24,034
- But we've been looking
for you everywhere.

137
00:09:24,034 --> 00:09:25,587
- Funny you couldn't find me.

138
00:09:25,587 --> 00:09:27,453
That's exactly where I've been.

139
00:09:27,453 --> 00:09:29,005
Everywhere.

140
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:31,345
- I've got to talk to you alone.

141
00:09:31,345 --> 00:09:32,840
- I don't think it's a good idea to talk

142
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,837
when there's nothing to say.

143
00:09:34,837 --> 00:09:37,197
- Please listen to me.

144
00:09:37,197 --> 00:09:38,632
- I'll do all I can to make that

145
00:09:38,632 --> 00:09:41,534
completely impossible, my dear.

146
00:09:41,534 --> 00:09:43,159
But excuse me now.

147
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,915
Good evening.

148
00:09:44,915 --> 00:09:47,915
(Bal-musette music)

149
00:09:56,707 --> 00:09:57,874
Double scotch.

150
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,737
- As bad as that?

151
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:05,190
- How come you know Mademoiselle Del Mar?

152
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,023
- I don't.

153
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,795
Fill it up again.

154
00:10:12,795 --> 00:10:14,655
- That won't help.

155
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,725
You know, you drink too much.

156
00:10:16,725 --> 00:10:18,808
- I don't drink too much.

157
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:21,502
But I talk too much.

158
00:10:22,632 --> 00:10:24,533
I talked to much just now.

159
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:28,366
- [Chavez] Why don't you
go down and tell her?

160
00:10:31,986 --> 00:10:34,160
- You know something, Chavez,

161
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,410
I think I will.

162
00:10:39,435 --> 00:10:41,311
- What's the matter, my dear?

163
00:10:41,311 --> 00:10:42,144
- Nothing.

164
00:10:43,513 --> 00:10:46,141
- You seemed to really
feel that song in there.

165
00:10:46,141 --> 00:10:48,236
Who were you singing it for?

166
00:10:48,236 --> 00:10:49,069
Me?

167
00:10:51,537 --> 00:10:54,320
If anything's worrying you, tell me.

168
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,320
(Bal-musette music)

169
00:11:10,868 --> 00:11:12,949
- [Officer] Hut, two, three, four!

170
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:13,915
Hut!

171
00:11:13,915 --> 00:11:17,332
(military drums beating)

172
00:11:34,265 --> 00:11:35,481
(Sergeant speaks foreign language)

173
00:11:35,481 --> 00:11:36,763
- Mueller.

174
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,086
- Mueller?

175
00:11:38,086 --> 00:11:41,503
(military drums beating)

176
00:11:42,565 --> 00:11:43,398
Italiano?

177
00:11:43,398 --> 00:11:44,498
- Si, Richetti.

178
00:11:44,498 --> 00:11:46,003
(military drums beating)

179
00:11:46,003 --> 00:11:46,989
- [Legionnaire] (nearby) Hut!

180
00:11:46,989 --> 00:11:48,958
Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut!

181
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:49,791
Hut!

182
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:53,026
- You English?

183
00:11:53,026 --> 00:11:54,782
- Does it matter?

184
00:11:54,782 --> 00:11:57,462
- When I ask question, I want answer.

185
00:11:57,462 --> 00:11:58,545
You see this?

186
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:01,896
- You asked a personal question, Sergeant.

187
00:12:01,896 --> 00:12:02,909
You ought to know better.

188
00:12:02,909 --> 00:12:06,940
- Also I know when somebody
too big for britches.

189
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,862
What's your name?

190
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:09,695
- Brown.

191
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,590
- Brown, eh?

192
00:12:12,884 --> 00:12:13,717
Not Smith?

193
00:12:14,915 --> 00:12:15,927
- Brown.

194
00:12:15,927 --> 00:12:17,182
- Good.

195
00:12:17,182 --> 00:12:19,682
Originality is a thing I like.

196
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:21,407
- Thanks.

197
00:12:24,657 --> 00:12:26,807
- You got a big mouth.

198
00:12:26,807 --> 00:12:28,474
- [Officer] Ten-hut!

199
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:36,122
- The men just transferred
from the 21st, sir.

200
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:36,955
- Good.

201
00:12:38,731 --> 00:12:42,445
- [Legionnaire] (nearby) Hut, hut, hut!

202
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:43,612
Hut, hut, hut!

203
00:12:45,045 --> 00:12:46,628
Hut, hut, hut, hut!

204
00:12:47,728 --> 00:12:50,453
Hut, hut, hut, hut, two, three, four!

205
00:12:50,453 --> 00:12:51,376
Hut!

206
00:12:51,376 --> 00:12:52,209
Hut!

207
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:54,540
Hut, hut, hut!

208
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:58,620
Hut, hut, hut, two, three, four!

209
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,453
Hut, hut!

210
00:13:06,877 --> 00:13:07,710
- All right.

211
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,543
- All right, Sarge.

212
00:13:08,543 --> 00:13:10,612
- Put down your bags.

213
00:13:10,612 --> 00:13:11,836
Ah.

214
00:13:11,836 --> 00:13:15,848
You are now no longer in
stinking outfit like 21st.

215
00:13:15,848 --> 00:13:18,255
You are now in good outfit, my outfit.

216
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:22,161
And you, you seven been
assigned to this squadron.

217
00:13:22,161 --> 00:13:23,161
My squadron.

218
00:13:24,023 --> 00:13:25,193
I am glad.

219
00:13:25,193 --> 00:13:27,060
I like your looks.

220
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,769
- That means he thinks
you got money, amigos.

221
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:29,602
- Quiet!

222
00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:32,110
(men laughing)

223
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,958
You're going to be like my children.

224
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,625
I be like father to all my men.

225
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:37,507
Is right?

226
00:13:37,507 --> 00:13:38,548
- [Legionnaire] Is right.

227
00:13:38,548 --> 00:13:39,381
Just like Father!

228
00:13:39,381 --> 00:13:41,348
- (laughs) Is right, there.

229
00:13:41,348 --> 00:13:42,182
I look after you.

230
00:13:42,182 --> 00:13:44,276
I make your life here very, very happy

231
00:13:44,276 --> 00:13:46,951
if you are good fellows.

232
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:47,868
Not stingy.

233
00:13:49,217 --> 00:13:50,134
Understand?

234
00:13:51,715 --> 00:13:53,109
Ah.

235
00:13:53,109 --> 00:13:54,584
Open your bags.

236
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,084
I make inspection.

237
00:13:58,891 --> 00:13:59,898
Hey, you.

238
00:13:59,898 --> 00:14:00,731
You!

239
00:14:00,731 --> 00:14:01,564
Where are you going?

240
00:14:01,564 --> 00:14:02,397
- Right here.

241
00:14:02,397 --> 00:14:03,344
I like it by the window.

242
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:05,420
- Oh, you like, huh?

243
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,576
You like?

244
00:14:06,576 --> 00:14:10,418
Everybody like, but is me
who says who goes where.

245
00:14:10,418 --> 00:14:11,991
- You've got some objections
to my having this bed?

246
00:14:11,991 --> 00:14:14,694
- I got objection you don't ask me.

247
00:14:14,694 --> 00:14:16,245
I'm Sergeant.

248
00:14:16,245 --> 00:14:17,078
- Mm-hmm.

249
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:18,799
- Open your bag.

250
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:19,966
Open your bag!

251
00:14:22,171 --> 00:14:23,004
Ah.

252
00:14:28,013 --> 00:14:28,846
Hey!

253
00:14:32,294 --> 00:14:33,794
Pretty good cigar.

254
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:37,464
Hey, you like same kind cigar I like.

255
00:14:37,464 --> 00:14:38,297
- You like?

256
00:14:38,297 --> 00:14:39,130
- Yeah.

257
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:39,963
- Please, take one, Sergeant.

258
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,137
- You give me?

259
00:14:41,137 --> 00:14:41,970
- Why, sure.

260
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,220
- Oh, thank you! (laughs)

261
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,053
Yeah.

262
00:14:47,116 --> 00:14:48,616
What you got here?

263
00:14:50,842 --> 00:14:53,925
You're going to be Private long time.

264
00:14:55,058 --> 00:14:55,891
Hey!

265
00:14:56,952 --> 00:14:59,629
Cognac, my favorite brand.

266
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:00,744
Very good.

267
00:15:00,744 --> 00:15:01,775
- I like it, too.

268
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,103
- Oh, you know something?

269
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:04,985
When two men like same brand cognac,

270
00:15:04,985 --> 00:15:07,041
is good sign they're going to be friends.

271
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,579
- I'm awfully glad to hear that, Sergeant.

272
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:09,781
- You should be.

273
00:15:09,781 --> 00:15:14,238
Is very fortunate for you. (laughs)

274
00:15:14,238 --> 00:15:17,871
And this fine bed I
give you by window, huh?

275
00:15:17,871 --> 00:15:19,083
- That's right, mm-hmm.

276
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,208
- Okay.

277
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,291
I borrow, no?

278
00:15:22,979 --> 00:15:24,363
- No.

279
00:15:24,363 --> 00:15:25,196
- What you mean?

280
00:15:25,196 --> 00:15:26,314
You crazy?

281
00:15:26,314 --> 00:15:28,283
In the Legion it's share and share alike.

282
00:15:28,283 --> 00:15:29,778
- This is private property.

283
00:15:29,778 --> 00:15:32,425
- In the Legion there
is no private property

284
00:15:32,425 --> 00:15:33,883
when Sergeant say so.

285
00:15:33,883 --> 00:15:35,422
- That's where you're wrong.

286
00:15:35,422 --> 00:15:38,253
It says so in Code Militaire
article 17, paragraph 9.

287
00:15:38,253 --> 00:15:39,086
- Ha!

288
00:15:39,086 --> 00:15:40,334
A lawyer! (laughs)

289
00:15:40,334 --> 00:15:41,606
Maybe you don't hear this.

290
00:15:41,606 --> 00:15:42,439
To the victor belongs the spoil--

291
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:44,237
- Sure, sure.

292
00:15:44,237 --> 00:15:46,196
But there hasn't been any
victory yet, Sergeant.

293
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:47,680
- Oh?

294
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,084
You think maybe you could
be victor over me, eh?

295
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:54,288
- Not with that stripe.

296
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:57,455
If you didn't have it on, I might try.

297
00:15:58,528 --> 00:16:00,778
- Oh, you want to try, huh?

298
00:16:02,982 --> 00:16:04,459
Huh?

299
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:05,292
All right.

300
00:16:05,292 --> 00:16:06,854
- Hold it, Jeff.

301
00:16:06,854 --> 00:16:07,951
Remember, for hitting a non-com,

302
00:16:07,951 --> 00:16:09,604
it's eight years in the clink.

303
00:16:09,604 --> 00:16:11,521
- Never mind the clink!

304
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:13,894
There's my stripes.

305
00:16:13,894 --> 00:16:15,279
- [Legionnaire] I bet
10 francs on the lawyer!

306
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,276
(men chattering)

307
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,227
I take that back.

308
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,894
(men scuffling)

309
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,900
- Attention!

310
00:16:27,698 --> 00:16:29,395
- Help him up.

311
00:16:29,395 --> 00:16:30,978
- Get away from me!

312
00:16:32,048 --> 00:16:32,881
What?

313
00:16:32,881 --> 00:16:34,503
Oh!
- Sergeant, report this man.

314
00:16:34,503 --> 00:16:35,336
- What?

315
00:16:37,335 --> 00:16:38,835
Oh, for what, sir?

316
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,915
- For attacking a superior.

317
00:16:41,915 --> 00:16:42,915
- Attacking?

318
00:16:43,751 --> 00:16:45,779
I beg Lieutenant's pardon.

319
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:47,033
Nobody attacked.

320
00:16:47,033 --> 00:16:48,287
- No?

321
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:50,070
Then what's supposed to have happened?

322
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,166
- Ah.

323
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:54,354
Oh, I slip on the combat
bottle of cognac there,

324
00:16:54,354 --> 00:16:57,396
I slip, bang! (laughs)

325
00:16:57,396 --> 00:16:59,862
- Right on your face, huh?

326
00:16:59,862 --> 00:17:01,283
- Oh, no, sir, I...

327
00:17:01,283 --> 00:17:03,509
Well, yes, right on my face.

328
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:04,410
It's stupid.

329
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,085
- Yes, very.

330
00:17:06,085 --> 00:17:09,555
For a man who likes his stripes.

331
00:17:09,555 --> 00:17:11,035
Who is Legionnaire Brown?

332
00:17:11,035 --> 00:17:12,035
- Here, sir.

333
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:16,699
- [Lieutenant] Come with me.

334
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:17,616
- Yes, sir.

335
00:17:26,518 --> 00:17:29,268
(men chattering)

336
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:40,440
- Baroness.

337
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,440
Your cousin.

338
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,692
- Thank you, Lieutenant.

339
00:17:52,413 --> 00:17:53,246
(door thuds shut)

340
00:17:53,246 --> 00:17:54,344
(dramatic music)

341
00:17:54,344 --> 00:17:55,253
- [Jeff] Baroness?

342
00:17:55,253 --> 00:17:56,119
Cousin?

343
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:57,202
What is this?

344
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,727
- I had to find some way of seeing you.

345
00:18:00,727 --> 00:18:02,640
- Well, now that you've seen me, goodbye.

346
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,562
- I know you don't understand, Jeff.

347
00:18:04,562 --> 00:18:06,004
But you must have patience.

348
00:18:06,004 --> 00:18:07,416
- Patience?

349
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,599
So you can pull one of your tricks again?

350
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:11,556
I buried myself in this
Legion for two years

351
00:18:11,556 --> 00:18:12,803
on account of you.

352
00:18:12,803 --> 00:18:14,893
Or maybe you don't remember.

353
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:16,676
- Only too well.

354
00:18:16,676 --> 00:18:18,413
But you've got to believe in me.

355
00:18:18,413 --> 00:18:20,206
There's never been anyone for me but you.

356
00:18:20,206 --> 00:18:21,562
- Oh, no?

357
00:18:21,562 --> 00:18:23,587
I think a woman ought to play square.

358
00:18:23,587 --> 00:18:25,450
One man at a time.

359
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,504
Go back to His Highness.

360
00:18:27,504 --> 00:18:29,289
The least you can do is
give him his money's worth.

361
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:30,447
(slap lands)

362
00:18:30,447 --> 00:18:32,947
(tense music)

363
00:18:34,093 --> 00:18:36,317
(door slams)

364
00:18:36,317 --> 00:18:37,624
- Pretty good cognac, huh?

365
00:18:37,624 --> 00:18:38,611
- [Man] Mm-hmm.

366
00:18:38,611 --> 00:18:40,515
(Sergeant laughing)

367
00:18:40,515 --> 00:18:42,382
- There we are.

368
00:18:42,382 --> 00:18:43,809
Drink up.

369
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:44,719
Oh!

370
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:45,552
Hey!

371
00:18:45,552 --> 00:18:47,302
I saved this for you!

372
00:18:48,455 --> 00:18:50,488
- Looks like you saved me
from getting drunk, too.

373
00:18:50,488 --> 00:18:53,013
- Hey, Brown, you're some fighter.

374
00:18:53,013 --> 00:18:53,846
- You, too.

375
00:18:53,846 --> 00:18:54,995
Next time let's be on the same side, huh?

376
00:18:54,995 --> 00:18:56,748
- (laughs) Is bargain.

377
00:18:56,748 --> 00:18:57,717
- Okay.

378
00:18:57,717 --> 00:18:59,905
- Brown, one of the transfers, he in here?

379
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:00,738
- Here.

380
00:19:03,138 --> 00:19:04,458
- The Colonel wants to see you.

381
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:05,703
- The Colonel?

382
00:19:05,703 --> 00:19:07,820
- Tell him I'm busy.

383
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,690
- You're what?

384
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:12,427
- What are you, crazy or something?

385
00:19:12,427 --> 00:19:13,541
- Is it on the level?

386
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:14,958
- Why, certainly.

387
00:19:18,826 --> 00:19:21,489
- Oh, my friend Jeff is in.

388
00:19:21,489 --> 00:19:22,834
Very good.

389
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:24,167
Or terrible bad.

390
00:19:27,787 --> 00:19:29,067
Why, that pig.

391
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,533
He drank it all!

392
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:32,331
(men laugh)

393
00:19:32,331 --> 00:19:34,100
- I wouldn't say I have the
best memory in the world,

394
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,313
Legionnaire Brown.

395
00:19:36,313 --> 00:19:39,208
But I seldom forget a face.

396
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,681
I've seen yours before.

397
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:42,514
Paris?

398
00:19:43,675 --> 00:19:45,876
- It's possible, sir.

399
00:19:45,876 --> 00:19:48,489
I believe I've seen you before.

400
00:19:48,489 --> 00:19:49,731
Monte Carlo?

401
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,231
- That's possible.

402
00:19:52,163 --> 00:19:55,344
The man I remember was an
officer in the French Army,

403
00:19:55,344 --> 00:19:57,460
the Signal Corps.

404
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,434
Have you had any experience in that field?

405
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:02,428
- I know something about it, sir.

406
00:20:02,428 --> 00:20:05,013
- And this fellow spoke
Arabic rather well.

407
00:20:05,013 --> 00:20:06,434
You, uh...

408
00:20:06,434 --> 00:20:07,769
- I can get by, sir.

409
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:09,299
- Good.

410
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:12,304
Those can be very useful talents at times.

411
00:20:12,304 --> 00:20:13,562
Thank you.

412
00:20:13,562 --> 00:20:14,587
And Brown.

413
00:20:14,587 --> 00:20:15,880
- Yes, sir?

414
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,016
- If it comes to you where we met,

415
00:20:19,016 --> 00:20:20,016
let me know.

416
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:24,211
- I will, sir.

417
00:20:24,211 --> 00:20:25,827
If it comes to me.

418
00:20:25,827 --> 00:20:28,577
(dramatic music)

419
00:20:30,072 --> 00:20:32,152
- Amir Al Raman.

420
00:20:32,152 --> 00:20:34,824
I've never had any reason to
question his loyalty to France.

421
00:20:34,824 --> 00:20:35,911
- But you don't know him.

422
00:20:35,911 --> 00:20:36,744
We do.

423
00:20:36,744 --> 00:20:38,839
- He'll stop at nothing
to get what he wants.

424
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:40,873
He'll set the whole country ablaze.

425
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:43,112
- Colonel, the massacre at Fort Algiers

426
00:20:43,112 --> 00:20:44,830
was designed for just one thing:

427
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,982
To convince the French
that only he has the power

428
00:20:46,982 --> 00:20:48,313
to keep order among the tribes

429
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,875
and that unless he is given
control of the territory,

430
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,391
there will never be peace.

431
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:53,617
- What has he to gain?

432
00:20:53,617 --> 00:20:55,139
- Black gold, oil.

433
00:20:55,139 --> 00:20:57,673
- If the French are forced
to recognize his authority,

434
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,936
he will seize the oil lands
which now belong to our tribes.

435
00:21:00,936 --> 00:21:02,264
- Then he will take the oil for himself

436
00:21:02,264 --> 00:21:03,564
and dispose of it as he wishes.

437
00:21:03,564 --> 00:21:07,674
- Gentlemen, thank you for
your loyalty and cooperation.

438
00:21:07,674 --> 00:21:09,757
France will see to it that
your rights are protected.

439
00:21:09,757 --> 00:21:10,840
- I trust so.

440
00:21:12,634 --> 00:21:14,124
- Goodbye, gentlemen.

441
00:21:14,124 --> 00:21:16,874
(dramatic music)

442
00:21:35,047 --> 00:21:36,506
- Well, good evening, Excellency.

443
00:21:36,506 --> 00:21:38,761
- Why, gentlemen, good evening.

444
00:21:38,761 --> 00:21:40,112
Mademoiselle Del Mar,

445
00:21:40,112 --> 00:21:41,597
my good friends Major Colle...

446
00:21:41,597 --> 00:21:42,892
- A pleasure, Mademoiselle.

447
00:21:42,892 --> 00:21:43,725
- Thank you, Major.

448
00:21:43,725 --> 00:21:45,270
- And Lieutenant Picard.

449
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,689
- Mademoiselle.

450
00:21:46,689 --> 00:21:47,522
- You looking for someone?

451
00:21:47,522 --> 00:21:48,390
Why don't you join us?

452
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,839
- Well...

453
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:50,672
Thank you.

454
00:21:50,672 --> 00:21:53,164
As a matter of fact, we're
looking for Captain DuPont.

455
00:21:53,164 --> 00:21:54,214
- He doesn't seem to be here yet, Major.

456
00:21:54,214 --> 00:21:55,057
- No.

457
00:21:55,057 --> 00:21:55,890
- Please sit down.

458
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,710
We'll have a farewell drink
with Mademoiselle Del Mar.

459
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:58,627
- Farewell?

460
00:22:00,109 --> 00:22:02,112
- Yes, I haven't told you.

461
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:05,013
We're leaving for the desert tomorrow.

462
00:22:05,013 --> 00:22:06,332
- The desert?

463
00:22:06,332 --> 00:22:07,898
- Yes.
- How exciting.

464
00:22:07,898 --> 00:22:09,713
- And His Excellency has
been kind enough to insist

465
00:22:09,713 --> 00:22:12,496
that we stay at his palace
in El Hazeer, Mademoiselle.

466
00:22:12,496 --> 00:22:15,149
- Anything I can do for
the French, I'm delighted.

467
00:22:15,149 --> 00:22:16,806
- Oh, the desert.

468
00:22:16,806 --> 00:22:18,292
I envy you.

469
00:22:18,292 --> 00:22:20,400
- You may have my share
of it, Mademoiselle.

470
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,233
- Really?

471
00:22:22,694 --> 00:22:25,490
You couldn't take me in his
place, could you, Major?

472
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:27,095
- Why,

473
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:29,084
I should be delighted.

474
00:22:29,084 --> 00:22:30,364
- If you're serious, Yvette,

475
00:22:30,364 --> 00:22:31,629
if you'd like to spend a few days there,

476
00:22:31,629 --> 00:22:33,606
I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

477
00:22:33,606 --> 00:22:35,316
- Oh, Amir, how could I?

478
00:22:35,316 --> 00:22:37,555
- There's nothing
primitive about my place.

479
00:22:37,555 --> 00:22:39,450
We've all the modern conveniences.

480
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,712
And you have the French
Army there to chaperone you.

481
00:22:41,712 --> 00:22:44,009
- (laughing) You don't
get an offer like that

482
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:45,328
every day, Mademoiselle.

483
00:22:45,328 --> 00:22:46,701
- Well, Yvette?

484
00:22:46,701 --> 00:22:48,336
- I don't get an offer
to sing in a nightclub

485
00:22:48,336 --> 00:22:49,936
every day either.

486
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:51,041
- Do I have to buy this place

487
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:53,238
in order to get you away from it?

488
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:55,263
- Well, I don't think
you'll have to do that.

489
00:22:55,263 --> 00:22:57,195
- You'll come, then?

490
00:22:57,195 --> 00:22:59,354
- Well, since the French
Army is going to be there...

491
00:22:59,354 --> 00:23:00,354
- Wonderful!

492
00:23:01,286 --> 00:23:03,004
To the desert.

493
00:23:03,004 --> 00:23:04,860
- To the desert.

494
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,610
(dramatic music)

495
00:23:09,747 --> 00:23:10,611
- La Dona!

496
00:23:10,611 --> 00:23:13,662
(Sergeant scoffs)

497
00:23:13,662 --> 00:23:15,009
- Well, play, play!

498
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:16,913
- Wait, wait.

499
00:23:16,913 --> 00:23:17,746
I've got to think.

500
00:23:17,746 --> 00:23:18,878
- You've got to think!

501
00:23:18,878 --> 00:23:20,988
You'll lose anyway.

502
00:23:20,988 --> 00:23:22,969
(Sergeant laughs)

503
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:24,445
(man speaking foreign language)

504
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:25,278
- Okay.

505
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,784
You got something there, smart guy?

506
00:23:26,784 --> 00:23:27,617
- Let's see your hand.

507
00:23:27,617 --> 00:23:29,627
- Oh, what for you want to see my hand?

508
00:23:29,627 --> 00:23:31,020
- If you've got the
cards I think you've got,

509
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,507
you didn't get them from the dealer.

510
00:23:32,507 --> 00:23:34,272
- Oh, you think I cheat, maybe, huh?

511
00:23:34,272 --> 00:23:35,451
- Just let me see your hand.

512
00:23:35,451 --> 00:23:36,284
- No!

513
00:23:36,284 --> 00:23:37,117
Do you think I cheat?

514
00:23:37,117 --> 00:23:37,950
We play it all over again.

515
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,046
Give me your cards!

516
00:23:39,046 --> 00:23:40,987
I'll show you if I cheat.

517
00:23:40,987 --> 00:23:41,820
- Ten-hut!

518
00:23:43,937 --> 00:23:44,770
At ease.

519
00:23:46,055 --> 00:23:48,362
Company C and the 22nd Infantry Regiment

520
00:23:48,362 --> 00:23:50,169
is alerted for movement.

521
00:23:50,169 --> 00:23:51,002
Sergeant.

522
00:23:51,002 --> 00:23:51,919
- Yes, sir?

523
00:23:55,021 --> 00:23:56,365
- Have your men ready to move at 04 hours

524
00:23:56,365 --> 00:23:58,334
Wednesday the 12th with full equipment.

525
00:23:58,334 --> 00:23:59,744
- Yes, sir.

526
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,812
- Passes will be issued to those

527
00:24:00,812 --> 00:24:02,835
wishing to leave the post tonight,

528
00:24:02,835 --> 00:24:05,984
but all men will report in by midnight.

529
00:24:05,984 --> 00:24:07,042
That is all.

530
00:24:07,042 --> 00:24:08,042
- Attention!

531
00:24:12,573 --> 00:24:13,406
Dismissed!

532
00:24:14,825 --> 00:24:18,266
(men chattering)

533
00:24:18,266 --> 00:24:19,697
- Where do you think
we're going, Sergeant?

534
00:24:19,697 --> 00:24:21,991
- Well, the General's staff
don't tell me their plans,

535
00:24:21,991 --> 00:24:23,505
but, uh,

536
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:24,962
I got pretty good guess.

537
00:24:24,962 --> 00:24:26,486
- Where?

538
00:24:26,486 --> 00:24:27,736
- Fort Algiers.

539
00:24:29,403 --> 00:24:31,511
(Chavez speaks in foreign language)

540
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:34,261
(dramatic music)

541
00:25:45,303 --> 00:25:46,668
(horse whinnying)

542
00:25:46,668 --> 00:25:49,751
(concertina playing)

543
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:54,090
- Say, that march nearly
killed me. (groans)

544
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,874
- It was not so bad.

545
00:25:55,874 --> 00:25:56,707
- Not for you.

546
00:25:56,707 --> 00:25:57,540
You ride.

547
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,373
- Sure.

548
00:25:58,373 --> 00:26:00,122
I'm Sergeant.

549
00:26:00,122 --> 00:26:02,890
- Hey, Sergeant, you look
pretty good on a horse.

550
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:03,986
There's only one trouble.

551
00:26:03,986 --> 00:26:06,298
Horse is better looking than you.

552
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,131
- Quiet.

553
00:26:08,945 --> 00:26:13,153
Ah, Jeff, it's your turn
for detail on guard duty.

554
00:26:13,153 --> 00:26:14,236
- Okay, okay.

555
00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:16,228
- Come on.

556
00:26:16,228 --> 00:26:17,311
- I'm coming.

557
00:26:20,431 --> 00:26:22,057
Play something else, will you?

558
00:26:22,057 --> 00:26:22,914
- What?

559
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,940
- I told you before, I
don't like that song.

560
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,570
- It's a free country.

561
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:27,403
- You heard him.

562
00:26:27,403 --> 00:26:28,859
Play something else.

563
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:30,609
- I play what I like.

564
00:26:32,983 --> 00:26:33,984
No!

565
00:26:33,984 --> 00:26:35,157
- Then don't play that song!

566
00:26:35,157 --> 00:26:36,010
- All right, I won't!

567
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,476
Give it to me!

568
00:26:37,476 --> 00:26:40,476
(crickets chirping)

569
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:54,823
- No.

570
00:27:01,168 --> 00:27:04,251
(concertina playing)

571
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:17,117
(dramatic music)

572
00:28:33,848 --> 00:28:34,681
- Amir.

573
00:28:36,304 --> 00:28:39,387
Come and tell me what all this means.

574
00:28:40,628 --> 00:28:42,118
That man, for instance,

575
00:28:42,118 --> 00:28:43,277
what's he doing?

576
00:28:43,277 --> 00:28:45,262
(man speaking in foreign language)

577
00:28:45,262 --> 00:28:47,103
- He's a storyteller.

578
00:28:47,103 --> 00:28:49,370
He repeats the old legends of the tribe,

579
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,905
reminds the people of their
glories in times gone by.

580
00:28:51,905 --> 00:28:54,846
It's a very honored profession.

581
00:28:54,846 --> 00:28:57,346
(tense music)

582
00:29:07,626 --> 00:29:10,246
- What's going on there?

583
00:29:10,246 --> 00:29:12,746
(tense music)

584
00:29:15,334 --> 00:29:17,797
- Yessouf, put a stop to that.

585
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:20,297
(tense music)

586
00:29:36,853 --> 00:29:38,546
- That's horrible.

587
00:29:38,546 --> 00:29:40,354
- I'm sorry, my dear.

588
00:29:40,354 --> 00:29:42,863
There's a thief in every marketplace.

589
00:29:42,863 --> 00:29:45,416
But that doesn't excuse such brutality.

590
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:48,686
Pardon me, I'll attend to this myself.

591
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:51,186
(tense music)

592
00:29:54,038 --> 00:29:56,519
- Did you recognize him?

593
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:58,855
- I couldn't be sure from this distance.

594
00:29:58,855 --> 00:30:00,706
- Go and find out.

595
00:30:00,706 --> 00:30:02,062
- Yes, sir.

596
00:30:02,062 --> 00:30:04,812
(dramatic music)

597
00:30:05,797 --> 00:30:06,880
- What is it?

598
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:11,998
- There's just a possibility
that man was our agent here.

599
00:30:11,998 --> 00:30:15,100
If so, there may be a change in plans.

600
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,600
I'll let you know.

601
00:30:18,178 --> 00:30:20,491
We'd better go inside.

602
00:30:20,491 --> 00:30:23,241
(dramatic music)

603
00:30:26,331 --> 00:30:27,715
- More coffee, my dear?

604
00:30:27,715 --> 00:30:28,715
- Thank you.

605
00:30:33,091 --> 00:30:33,924
- Excellency.

606
00:30:33,924 --> 00:30:34,757
- Yes?

607
00:30:34,757 --> 00:30:35,918
- A messenger for Major Colle.

608
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:37,501
- Have him come in.

609
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:46,094
- This just came for you, sir.

610
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,094
- Thank you.

611
00:30:50,538 --> 00:30:53,121
(Colle scoffs)

612
00:30:56,296 --> 00:30:57,796
There's no answer.

613
00:30:59,547 --> 00:31:02,921
I'm afraid we shall have to cut
our visit short, Excellency.

614
00:31:02,921 --> 00:31:04,175
- Oh?

615
00:31:04,175 --> 00:31:05,550
When must you leave?

616
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,632
- We must leave for the fort immediately.

617
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:08,465
Sorry.

618
00:31:08,465 --> 00:31:10,082
- But you'll be riding all night.

619
00:31:10,082 --> 00:31:11,895
- Those are the orders, Excellency.

620
00:31:11,895 --> 00:31:13,595
I shall have one of my men
accompany you to the city.

621
00:31:13,595 --> 00:31:16,008
- Oh, that won't be necessary.

622
00:31:16,008 --> 00:31:17,425
My home is yours.

623
00:31:18,406 --> 00:31:20,911
- Well, I couldn't think
of staying here alone.

624
00:31:20,911 --> 00:31:23,502
- You'll have all the
protection of my armed guards.

625
00:31:23,502 --> 00:31:26,496
- As a matter of fact,
Mademoiselle, it is a hard ride.

626
00:31:26,496 --> 00:31:28,391
- The Major's right.

627
00:31:28,391 --> 00:31:29,224
- Well--

628
00:31:29,224 --> 00:31:32,502
- I can take you back to
the city in the morning.

629
00:31:32,502 --> 00:31:36,144
- Perhaps it would be best, Mademoiselle.

630
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,567
- I seem to be outvoted.

631
00:31:37,567 --> 00:31:38,579
- Good.

632
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:40,649
Then you'll stay.

633
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:41,986
- Please excuse us, Mademoiselle.

634
00:31:41,986 --> 00:31:42,869
- Of course.

635
00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:43,702
Goodbye, Lieutenant.

636
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:44,535
- Mademoiselle.

637
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:45,368
- Major.

638
00:31:45,368 --> 00:31:46,618
- Mademoiselle.

639
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:51,531
(dramatic music)

640
00:31:53,137 --> 00:31:54,075
It's been a pleasure, Excellency.

641
00:31:54,075 --> 00:31:54,908
- Thanks.

642
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,370
(dramatic music)

643
00:32:08,227 --> 00:32:09,906
- Well, my dear,

644
00:32:09,906 --> 00:32:13,345
you are now in the hands of a barbarian.

645
00:32:13,345 --> 00:32:16,066
Are you planning to
run away in the morning

646
00:32:16,066 --> 00:32:17,477
or to stay?

647
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,661
- I was wondering about that myself.

648
00:32:19,661 --> 00:32:21,732
- Have you reached any decision?

649
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:22,565
- Not yet.

650
00:32:24,574 --> 00:32:27,135
Well, it's quite late and I'm tired.

651
00:32:27,135 --> 00:32:27,968
Goodnight.

652
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:32,798
- Goodnight.

653
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:35,548
(dramatic music)

654
00:32:45,198 --> 00:32:48,115
(concertina music)

655
00:32:56,482 --> 00:32:59,232
(men chattering)

656
00:33:01,881 --> 00:33:04,964
(playing concertina)

657
00:33:12,937 --> 00:33:13,770
- What's the matter?

658
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:16,212
You don't watch what you're doing.

659
00:33:16,212 --> 00:33:17,656
- You're right, I guess I don't.

660
00:33:17,656 --> 00:33:18,520
- Here.

661
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,770
- So long as you watch what he's doing.

662
00:33:23,786 --> 00:33:26,020
- Does something eat you maybe?

663
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,223
- No.

664
00:33:27,223 --> 00:33:29,888
- Well, something's
eating me, I can tell you.

665
00:33:29,888 --> 00:33:31,597
You don't think those two
officers come down here

666
00:33:31,597 --> 00:33:33,090
for their health.

667
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:34,347
I've been in the Army a long time.

668
00:33:34,347 --> 00:33:36,139
They're cooking up something inside.

669
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:36,972
Don't worry.

670
00:33:36,972 --> 00:33:38,216
- (chuckles) We not worried.

671
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:39,049
Are we?

672
00:33:40,272 --> 00:33:41,134
- Go on, Luigi, play.

673
00:33:41,134 --> 00:33:42,384
It's your turn.

674
00:33:43,593 --> 00:33:45,105
- The death of our agent
at El Kazeel leaves us

675
00:33:45,105 --> 00:33:46,404
in a difficult position.

676
00:33:46,404 --> 00:33:48,575
- Perhaps I can find
someone to replace him.

677
00:33:48,575 --> 00:33:49,639
- What, on short notice?

678
00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:51,038
The qualifications alone--

679
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:54,236
- Are that he would have
to know the language.

680
00:33:54,236 --> 00:33:55,592
- I'm afraid that's not
quite enough, Colonel.

681
00:33:55,592 --> 00:33:56,642
- No, no, no.

682
00:33:56,642 --> 00:33:58,244
- He'd have to know codes, signals.

683
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:01,086
- How about a former officer
of the Signal Corps, gentlemen,

684
00:34:01,086 --> 00:34:02,503
who knows Arabic?

685
00:34:03,725 --> 00:34:07,058
(men chattering nearby)

686
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:12,614
- We play for big money this time, eh?

687
00:34:12,614 --> 00:34:13,598
- Okay.

688
00:34:13,598 --> 00:34:15,122
But I warn you, no miracles.

689
00:34:15,122 --> 00:34:15,955
- Miracles?

690
00:34:15,955 --> 00:34:17,721
Who wants miracles?

691
00:34:17,721 --> 00:34:18,825
- I don't.

692
00:34:18,825 --> 00:34:21,334
- (laughs) I play very scientific game.

693
00:34:21,334 --> 00:34:22,167
- Sure.

694
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,745
- Your bet, Luigi.

695
00:34:28,745 --> 00:34:30,136
- [Lieutenant] Private Kalmani?

696
00:34:30,136 --> 00:34:31,840
- Sergeant Kalmani, sir.

697
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,340
- Private Kalmani.

698
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:38,917
30 day demotion seems to be,
uh, in the cards, Private.

699
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:39,750
- Ehh.

700
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:42,333
(gentle music)

701
00:34:53,527 --> 00:34:55,496
- You play an excellent game.

702
00:34:55,496 --> 00:34:57,412
- You're very good yourself.

703
00:34:57,412 --> 00:34:59,390
- Oh, I hardly play at all.

704
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,195
- I wasn't talking about the chess.

705
00:35:02,195 --> 00:35:05,781
I meant the game you're playing with me.

706
00:35:05,781 --> 00:35:07,310
- Oh?

707
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,836
What game?

708
00:35:08,836 --> 00:35:11,158
- You didn't come out
here to see the desert.

709
00:35:11,158 --> 00:35:13,757
What did you come out for?

710
00:35:13,757 --> 00:35:15,674
You like me, don't you?

711
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:18,565
- I'm not sure yet.

712
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,601
How can I check you?

713
00:35:22,601 --> 00:35:23,434
- Why try?

714
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:27,375
- That's the way to win the game.

715
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,292
- There's a better way.

716
00:35:30,514 --> 00:35:31,347
You know,

717
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:34,476
I like you.

718
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:36,749
Very much.

719
00:35:37,665 --> 00:35:40,496
- And you'd like to add me to your harem.

720
00:35:40,496 --> 00:35:41,482
- I don't have a harem.

721
00:35:41,482 --> 00:35:44,183
You see, I'm a modern sort of barbarian.

722
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,270
- So I've heard.

723
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,820
A one-woman man.

724
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,737
One after the other.

725
00:35:48,737 --> 00:35:51,445
- None of them are working in nightclubs.

726
00:35:51,445 --> 00:35:53,361
Oh, that reminds me.

727
00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:56,146
I have something for you.

728
00:35:56,146 --> 00:35:58,729
(gentle music)

729
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,673
Here, take them.

730
00:36:07,786 --> 00:36:08,619
- Amir.

731
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:12,085
I don't know what to say.

732
00:36:18,932 --> 00:36:22,201
- There's a history behind
those pearls, Yvette.

733
00:36:22,201 --> 00:36:23,618
They deserve you.

734
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:26,199
Go on, put them on.

735
00:36:28,095 --> 00:36:28,928
Yes?

736
00:36:28,928 --> 00:36:29,855
- May I speak with you, sir?

737
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:31,220
- Yes, what is it?

738
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,680
- Alone, Your Excellency.

739
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,680
- Excuse me.

740
00:36:36,189 --> 00:36:38,772
(gentle music)

741
00:36:51,057 --> 00:36:53,697
I'm very sorry, my dear,
but something's come up.

742
00:36:53,697 --> 00:36:55,833
I won't be able to go
riding with you tomorrow.

743
00:36:55,833 --> 00:36:56,721
- Oh, that's too bad.

744
00:36:56,721 --> 00:36:59,332
I was looking forward to it.

745
00:36:59,332 --> 00:37:02,288
Well, if you're going to
be busy, I can't insist.

746
00:37:02,288 --> 00:37:04,209
- Yes, you see, Yessouf
has just reminded me,

747
00:37:04,209 --> 00:37:06,514
I must prepare for my guests,

748
00:37:06,514 --> 00:37:08,063
the leading sheiks of this area.

749
00:37:08,063 --> 00:37:09,146
- May I help?

750
00:37:11,976 --> 00:37:14,463
- I may call on you, at that,

751
00:37:14,463 --> 00:37:17,288
to charm some of my friends.

752
00:37:17,288 --> 00:37:20,715
- Well, if they're as handsome
as you, it'll be a pleasure.

753
00:37:20,715 --> 00:37:22,610
- Why, thank you.

754
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:23,693
- Not at all.

755
00:37:27,069 --> 00:37:29,819
(dramatic music)

756
00:41:15,951 --> 00:41:17,122
- So is everything clear now?

757
00:41:17,122 --> 00:41:18,425
- I think so, sir.

758
00:41:18,425 --> 00:41:19,258
- Good.

759
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:24,481
(watch chiming musically)

760
00:41:28,854 --> 00:41:29,735
You know if you run into trouble,

761
00:41:29,735 --> 00:41:31,438
there's nothing we can do to help you.

762
00:41:31,438 --> 00:41:33,546
The minute you leave this place,

763
00:41:33,546 --> 00:41:34,986
we never even heard of you.

764
00:41:34,986 --> 00:41:36,320
- Certainly, sir.

765
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,068
But there ought to be two of us on this,

766
00:41:38,068 --> 00:41:39,795
just in case something happened to one.

767
00:41:39,795 --> 00:41:40,628
- Colonel?

768
00:41:40,628 --> 00:41:41,868
- Take anyone you want.

769
00:41:41,868 --> 00:41:44,942
I trust your judgment, Brown.

770
00:41:44,942 --> 00:41:46,733
- Thank you, sir.

771
00:41:46,733 --> 00:41:48,349
- Now, remember,

772
00:41:48,349 --> 00:41:50,840
"My grandfather had one just like it."

773
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,224
- Yes, sir.

774
00:41:52,224 --> 00:41:54,974
(dramatic music)

775
00:42:19,897 --> 00:42:21,769
(knocking on door)

776
00:42:21,769 --> 00:42:24,519
(dramatic music)

777
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,218
- Yvette?

778
00:42:35,218 --> 00:42:40,218
- Mademoiselle Del Mar is
not in her room, Excellency.

779
00:42:40,237 --> 00:42:41,070
- Where is she?

780
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:42,726
- She went to the village.

781
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,286
If I may make a suggestion, Excellency.

782
00:42:45,286 --> 00:42:46,921
- Yes?

783
00:42:46,921 --> 00:42:49,469
- Mademoiselle Del Mar
moves about quite freely.

784
00:42:49,469 --> 00:42:51,045
After all, she's not an Arab and

785
00:42:51,045 --> 00:42:52,284
since we caught that French spy--

786
00:42:52,284 --> 00:42:55,201
- Mademoiselle Del Mar is my guest.

787
00:42:56,804 --> 00:42:58,387
- As you wish, sir.

788
00:42:59,721 --> 00:43:02,471
(dramatic music)

789
00:43:09,652 --> 00:43:13,152
(watch chiming musically)

790
00:43:17,203 --> 00:43:18,309
- Do you wish to sell this?

791
00:43:18,309 --> 00:43:19,813
- Yes.

792
00:43:19,813 --> 00:43:23,759
(watch chiming musically)

793
00:43:23,759 --> 00:43:25,013
- How much you asking for it?

794
00:43:25,013 --> 00:43:26,346
- 10,000 francs.

795
00:43:27,968 --> 00:43:32,399
- Heaven protect you, my
son, as it does all mad men.

796
00:43:32,399 --> 00:43:34,069
- That's an interesting watch.

797
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,702
Do you want to sell it?

798
00:43:35,702 --> 00:43:36,875
- What?

799
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:38,900
- The watch, is it for sale?

800
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,755
- Why, no.

801
00:43:39,755 --> 00:43:40,766
I mean, yes.

802
00:43:40,766 --> 00:43:41,698
- Let me look at it.

803
00:43:41,698 --> 00:43:44,293
(watch chiming musically)

804
00:43:44,293 --> 00:43:47,293
My grandfather had one just like it.

805
00:43:48,767 --> 00:43:51,060
How much do you want for it?

806
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,393
- 10,000 francs.

807
00:43:54,213 --> 00:43:56,247
- It's too expensive.

808
00:43:56,247 --> 00:43:57,464
- 7,000.

809
00:43:57,464 --> 00:44:00,191
- Madame, he's a cutthroat.

810
00:44:00,191 --> 00:44:02,550
I can show you much better
things at half the price.

811
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:03,383
- 5,000.

812
00:44:04,312 --> 00:44:06,979
- No, it's still too much money.

813
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:10,145
- Tell me, this kind of thing,

814
00:44:10,145 --> 00:44:11,717
did you ever do it before?

815
00:44:11,717 --> 00:44:12,550
- Of course.

816
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:14,020
- Well, why didn't you tell me?

817
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,203
- I tried to, you wouldn't listen to me.

818
00:44:16,203 --> 00:44:18,391
- Try again sometime.

819
00:44:18,391 --> 00:44:21,114
5,000, madame, it's my last word.

820
00:44:21,114 --> 00:44:23,801
- 2,000, my good man, that's my last word.

821
00:44:23,801 --> 00:44:26,141
- But madame, the music
alone is priceless.

822
00:44:26,141 --> 00:44:27,460
And isn't the memory of your grandfather

823
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,838
worth a few thousand?

824
00:44:29,838 --> 00:44:32,556
- 3,000 for the box and the watch.

825
00:44:32,556 --> 00:44:34,166
Now, take it or leave it.

826
00:44:34,166 --> 00:44:36,088
- Very well, madame, but you'll ruin me.

827
00:44:36,088 --> 00:44:38,505
I have five children to feed.

828
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:40,989
- Plans for the palace
and your instructions

829
00:44:40,989 --> 00:44:42,943
are in these bills, understand?

830
00:44:42,943 --> 00:44:43,776
- Yes.

831
00:44:47,113 --> 00:44:49,863
(dramatic music)

832
00:47:45,368 --> 00:47:47,152
(object clatters)

833
00:47:47,152 --> 00:47:49,652
(tense music)

834
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:42,123
(gentle music)

835
00:49:44,511 --> 00:49:46,824
(horses galloping nearby)

836
00:49:46,824 --> 00:49:49,452
- They come nearer this time.

837
00:49:49,452 --> 00:49:51,530
- Yeah, they're on that side road now.

838
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,413
- I go look, you stay here.

839
00:49:52,413 --> 00:49:53,871
- No, I go look.

840
00:49:53,871 --> 00:49:55,562
You stay here.

841
00:49:55,562 --> 00:49:56,395
Private.

842
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,190
(dramatic music)

843
00:50:13,097 --> 00:50:14,268
- What is it?

844
00:50:14,268 --> 00:50:16,989
- Another sheik and his
men headed for the palace.

845
00:50:16,989 --> 00:50:18,782
- I wonder what's going on.

846
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:19,973
- We'll soon find out.

847
00:50:19,973 --> 00:50:21,200
- Ah.

848
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,950
(dramatic music)

849
00:50:25,735 --> 00:50:26,568
Ah!

850
00:50:27,797 --> 00:50:30,547
(dramatic music)

851
00:50:42,116 --> 00:50:44,329
- And so instead of
striking at another fort,

852
00:50:44,329 --> 00:50:46,762
our full forces will
take over the oilfields.

853
00:50:46,762 --> 00:50:48,042
- Destroy them?

854
00:50:48,042 --> 00:50:49,809
- No, work them.

855
00:50:49,809 --> 00:50:52,326
Then let the French drive us out.

856
00:50:52,326 --> 00:50:54,314
We'll have the sympathy
of the entire world.

857
00:50:54,314 --> 00:50:55,584
- But this is revolt!

858
00:50:55,584 --> 00:50:56,501
- Possibly.

859
00:50:57,936 --> 00:51:00,119
Are there any objections?

860
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:00,952
- Yes.

861
00:51:01,828 --> 00:51:04,063
I've followed you until now, Amir,

862
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:05,794
because your birth makes
you the rightful leader

863
00:51:05,794 --> 00:51:07,102
of our tribes,

864
00:51:07,102 --> 00:51:08,019
but revolt?

865
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:11,057
Why, this is madness!

866
00:51:11,057 --> 00:51:12,979
I'll follow you no longer.

867
00:51:12,979 --> 00:51:14,180
- Perhaps not, Al Haroon,

868
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,100
but there are countless
thousands that will

869
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,519
and I cannot help but believe, Haroon,

870
00:51:18,519 --> 00:51:21,489
that your words are those
of a paid French agent.

871
00:51:21,489 --> 00:51:22,322
- Liar.

872
00:51:23,614 --> 00:51:27,054
I wonder whose money you've
been spending so freely.

873
00:51:27,054 --> 00:51:29,682
Not your own, I'm sure.

874
00:51:29,682 --> 00:51:30,897
Possibly that of some nation

875
00:51:30,897 --> 00:51:32,663
that would like to see fire and bloodshed

876
00:51:32,663 --> 00:51:36,580
sweep over our land for
its own selfish aims.

877
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:39,350
- I am free to accept help
from whomever I choose.

878
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:41,135
- So you are.

879
00:51:41,135 --> 00:51:43,802
But you'll have no more from me.

880
00:51:46,977 --> 00:51:49,137
Heaven go with you, gentlemen.

881
00:51:49,137 --> 00:51:51,584
(men all replying)

882
00:51:51,584 --> 00:51:53,334
- One moment, Haroon.

883
00:51:55,252 --> 00:51:57,419
We must not part in anger.

884
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,203
To your friendship and loyalty.

885
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:21,277
- Are your secrets safe with Al Haroon?

886
00:52:21,277 --> 00:52:24,194
- I'm sure he will never betray me.

887
00:52:41,402 --> 00:52:42,611
(Haroon cries out)

888
00:52:42,611 --> 00:52:46,900
And we will crush anyone
who stands in our way.

889
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,983
I do this to keep the
profits in our hands.

890
00:52:48,983 --> 00:52:50,720
Make your men ready.

891
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,810
We will strike within 24 hours.

892
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:54,257
- [Sheik] We must be careful
in organizing our men.

893
00:52:54,257 --> 00:52:56,497
The French will suspect us.

894
00:52:56,497 --> 00:52:58,800
- They suspect us now.

895
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:03,292
But as long as we're
right, what does it matter?

896
00:53:03,292 --> 00:53:05,792
(tense music)

897
00:53:22,977 --> 00:53:24,534
- Quiet!

898
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:27,034
(tense music)

899
00:53:38,911 --> 00:53:42,661
- And may good fortune
ride with us tomorrow.

900
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:46,937
Oh, no, no, this way, my friends.

901
00:53:46,937 --> 00:53:49,437
(tense music)

902
00:54:58,732 --> 00:54:59,732
- Oilfields.

903
00:55:01,228 --> 00:55:02,478
At Sidi El Bar.

904
00:55:05,784 --> 00:55:07,284
Target for attack.

905
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:11,431
Within 24 hours.

906
00:55:17,055 --> 00:55:17,960
- Let's go.

907
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:20,460
(tense music)

908
00:55:52,006 --> 00:55:54,439
- I thought you gave me
the key to this room.

909
00:55:54,439 --> 00:55:55,476
- Sorry.

910
00:55:55,476 --> 00:55:57,541
I keep a master key.

911
00:55:57,541 --> 00:55:59,000
- If you'd knocked, I'd have let you in.

912
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,439
- Would you?

913
00:56:00,439 --> 00:56:02,148
At this late hour?

914
00:56:02,148 --> 00:56:06,398
- Well, as a matter of
fact, I was about to retire.

915
00:56:07,805 --> 00:56:10,011
I've been admiring them.

916
00:56:10,011 --> 00:56:11,891
They're beautiful.

917
00:56:11,891 --> 00:56:12,974
- So are you.

918
00:56:14,092 --> 00:56:16,730
More beautiful tonight than ever before.

919
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:19,480
(dramatic music)

920
00:56:21,364 --> 00:56:22,579
- [Yvette] But I am tired.

921
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:23,916
Couldn't we talk tomorrow?

922
00:56:23,916 --> 00:56:26,416
(tense music)

923
00:56:37,307 --> 00:56:38,307
- Talk fast.

924
00:56:41,004 --> 00:56:43,334
- The mic went dead and...

925
00:56:43,334 --> 00:56:45,324
- What did you hear before
it was disconnected?

926
00:56:45,324 --> 00:56:47,824
(tense music)

927
00:57:00,529 --> 00:57:01,681
- Wait!

928
00:57:01,681 --> 00:57:02,989
She's signaling again.

929
00:57:02,989 --> 00:57:04,925
(tense music)

930
00:57:04,925 --> 00:57:06,592
- Send Yessouf here.

931
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,070
- They've caught her.

932
00:57:12,329 --> 00:57:13,162
- Let's get going.

933
00:57:13,162 --> 00:57:14,521
We've got to get to fort.

934
00:57:14,521 --> 00:57:15,771
- You go ahead.

935
00:57:17,587 --> 00:57:18,654
- Jeff, you crazy!

936
00:57:18,654 --> 00:57:19,843
Come back here!

937
00:57:19,843 --> 00:57:22,676
(thrilling music)

938
00:58:24,552 --> 00:58:25,634
- Now that you know everything,

939
00:58:25,634 --> 00:58:27,875
how much does French Intelligence know?

940
00:58:27,875 --> 00:58:28,708
- Nothing.

941
00:58:30,566 --> 00:58:32,437
Nothing at all.

942
00:58:32,437 --> 00:58:33,770
- [Amir] You lie.

943
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:34,603
(Yvette cries out)

944
00:58:34,603 --> 00:58:37,436
(thrilling music)

945
00:58:43,047 --> 00:58:43,880
Yessouf!

946
00:58:44,836 --> 00:58:45,795
Yessouf!

947
00:58:45,795 --> 00:58:48,628
(thrilling music)

948
00:59:20,383 --> 00:59:21,359
- Excellency!

949
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:23,829
(pounding at door)

950
00:59:23,829 --> 00:59:25,212
Excellency, Excellency!

951
00:59:25,212 --> 00:59:28,045
(thrilling music)

952
00:59:47,206 --> 00:59:48,619
You! Come here!

953
00:59:48,619 --> 00:59:51,452
(thrilling music)

954
00:59:59,604 --> 01:00:00,586
Excellency!

955
01:00:00,586 --> 01:00:03,419
(thrilling music)

956
01:00:23,446 --> 01:00:24,290
- [Jeff] Yvette!

957
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:27,123
(thrilling music)

958
01:00:34,669 --> 01:00:35,874
- Excellency!

959
01:00:35,874 --> 01:00:38,707
(thrilling music)

960
01:00:52,876 --> 01:00:53,888
- After them!

961
01:00:53,888 --> 01:00:56,721
(thrilling music)

962
01:01:05,303 --> 01:01:06,687
(gun fires)

963
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:09,520
(thrilling music)

964
01:01:13,149 --> 01:01:14,507
(guns firing)

965
01:01:14,507 --> 01:01:15,631
They'll try to get to the fort.

966
01:01:15,631 --> 01:01:16,751
Send riders to overtake them.

967
01:01:16,751 --> 01:01:17,765
Have them brought back here to me.

968
01:01:17,765 --> 01:01:18,598
- Yes, Excellency.

969
01:01:18,598 --> 01:01:19,818
- And Yessouf,

970
01:01:19,818 --> 01:01:21,306
have all the tribes alerted.

971
01:01:21,306 --> 01:01:22,249
My plans have changed.

972
01:01:22,249 --> 01:01:23,849
We'll attack the oilfields at midday.

973
01:01:23,849 --> 01:01:25,179
- Yes, Excellency.

974
01:01:25,179 --> 01:01:28,012
(thrilling music)

975
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:51,633
- Come on!

976
01:01:53,975 --> 01:01:56,447
(guns firing)

977
01:01:56,447 --> 01:01:59,280
(thrilling music)

978
01:02:05,364 --> 01:02:08,224
(guns firing)

979
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:11,057
(thrilling music)

980
01:02:21,572 --> 01:02:22,776
Quick, this way!

981
01:02:22,776 --> 01:02:25,609
(thrilling music)

982
01:03:08,613 --> 01:03:10,722
Well, that's that.

983
01:03:10,722 --> 01:03:12,793
We'll have to head for the oilfields.

984
01:03:12,793 --> 01:03:13,626
Not now.

985
01:03:13,626 --> 01:03:15,948
Now we got a long ride ahead of us.

986
01:03:15,948 --> 01:03:18,486
We'd better let the horses rest a while.

987
01:03:18,486 --> 01:03:20,225
- I could use some rest myself.

988
01:03:20,225 --> 01:03:22,808
(gentle music)

989
01:03:27,777 --> 01:03:29,277
- Hello, stranger.

990
01:03:30,489 --> 01:03:33,341
- We could be strangers, at that.

991
01:03:33,341 --> 01:03:34,767
Two years.

992
01:03:34,767 --> 01:03:36,285
Two long years.

993
01:03:36,285 --> 01:03:37,118
- Mm.

994
01:03:38,217 --> 01:03:39,634
It seems like 50.

995
01:03:41,459 --> 01:03:43,675
- Jeff, I've got to tell you something.

996
01:03:43,675 --> 01:03:44,700
- Mm-hmm?

997
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,233
- Please, listen.

998
01:03:46,233 --> 01:03:48,180
- Beautiful eyes.

999
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:49,180
Lovely hair.

1000
01:03:50,245 --> 01:03:51,424
- You don't seem to care.

1001
01:03:51,424 --> 01:03:52,558
- About the past?

1002
01:03:52,558 --> 01:03:54,350
Why should I?

1003
01:03:54,350 --> 01:03:56,171
Now I know you're a secret agent.

1004
01:03:56,171 --> 01:03:57,341
So?

1005
01:03:57,341 --> 01:03:59,317
- I suppose you didn't
know then that you'd be

1006
01:03:59,317 --> 01:04:02,384
dishonorably discharged for
hitting a superior officer.

1007
01:04:02,384 --> 01:04:04,939
You almost killed that Colonel.

1008
01:04:04,939 --> 01:04:06,782
- I wish I had.

1009
01:04:06,782 --> 01:04:08,365
- He was a traitor, you know?

1010
01:04:08,365 --> 01:04:10,733
And I was assigned to get the proof.

1011
01:04:10,733 --> 01:04:13,158
And then when he was finally convicted and

1012
01:04:13,158 --> 01:04:15,080
I could talk, you were gone.

1013
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:17,719
Disappeared, as if the
earth had swallowed you up.

1014
01:04:17,719 --> 01:04:20,654
- You know, you're wonderful
when you get excited.

1015
01:04:20,654 --> 01:04:24,787
- Oh, Jeff, you haven't
heard a word I've said.

1016
01:04:24,787 --> 01:04:27,537
(romantic music)

1017
01:04:31,751 --> 01:04:34,584
(thrilling music)

1018
01:04:57,357 --> 01:04:58,900
(gun fires)

1019
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:00,953
(horse whinnies)

1020
01:05:00,953 --> 01:05:03,703
(dramatic music)

1021
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:40,594
- I hope Kalmani got through to the fort.

1022
01:05:40,594 --> 01:05:43,344
(dramatic music)

1023
01:05:44,518 --> 01:05:45,850
Let's hurry.

1024
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:48,600
(dramatic music)

1025
01:06:30,059 --> 01:06:31,975
- [Man] Corporal of the guard!

1026
01:06:31,975 --> 01:06:34,725
(dramatic music)

1027
01:07:03,418 --> 01:07:06,085
(bugle blowing)

1028
01:07:10,924 --> 01:07:12,522
- Colonel Lasalle speaking.

1029
01:07:12,522 --> 01:07:15,613
Proceed with all haste to
the Sidi El Bar oilfields.

1030
01:07:15,613 --> 01:07:17,329
Expect attack within a few hours.

1031
01:07:17,329 --> 01:07:19,996
(bugle blowing)

1032
01:07:21,156 --> 01:07:23,906
(dramatic music)

1033
01:07:28,654 --> 01:07:30,832
24th Mountain Battalion,

1034
01:07:30,832 --> 01:07:34,273
proceed with all haste to
the oilfields at Sidi El Bar.

1035
01:07:34,273 --> 01:07:37,023
(dramatic music)

1036
01:08:44,190 --> 01:08:46,857
(phone ringing)

1037
01:08:51,769 --> 01:08:52,602
- No, I guess you're right.

1038
01:08:52,602 --> 01:08:54,435
The lines must be cut.

1039
01:08:55,956 --> 01:09:00,824
- [Man] Hey, we can rig this
paddleboard for a detonator.

1040
01:09:00,824 --> 01:09:02,022
- Have you any dynamite?

1041
01:09:02,022 --> 01:09:03,359
- Yeah, we have some.

1042
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,669
- Maybe we can make use of this.

1043
01:09:04,669 --> 01:09:05,502
Where is it?

1044
01:09:05,502 --> 01:09:06,335
- Outside.

1045
01:09:06,335 --> 01:09:07,168
- Let's get it.

1046
01:09:07,168 --> 01:09:09,918
(dramatic music)

1047
01:09:11,251 --> 01:09:12,084
- There it is.

1048
01:09:12,084 --> 01:09:14,834
(dramatic music)

1049
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,084
- [Guard] They're coming now!

1050
01:09:21,084 --> 01:09:22,955
They're assembling!

1051
01:09:22,955 --> 01:09:25,705
(dramatic music)

1052
01:09:37,103 --> 01:09:38,013
- All right, bring it out.

1053
01:09:38,013 --> 01:09:39,163
- [Guard] Hurry, down there!

1054
01:09:39,163 --> 01:09:41,916
- Got some nitroglycerine here, too.

1055
01:09:41,916 --> 01:09:44,054
(dramatic music)

1056
01:09:44,054 --> 01:09:45,551
- Any old cans around?

1057
01:09:45,551 --> 01:09:47,353
- We got plenty of empty beer bottles.

1058
01:09:47,353 --> 01:09:48,365
- They'll make good grenades.

1059
01:09:48,365 --> 01:09:49,328
- Let's go!

1060
01:09:49,328 --> 01:09:52,078
(dramatic music)

1061
01:09:57,752 --> 01:10:00,749
- Take that lead wire
back to the paddleboard.

1062
01:10:00,749 --> 01:10:02,999
Show the girl how it works!

1063
01:10:05,261 --> 01:10:07,808
Plant the dynamite deeper,
we'll get more blasts.

1064
01:10:07,808 --> 01:10:09,277
Come on, men, hurry!

1065
01:10:09,277 --> 01:10:12,027
(dramatic music)

1066
01:10:17,972 --> 01:10:19,773
Bring more wire here!

1067
01:10:19,773 --> 01:10:22,523
(dramatic music)

1068
01:10:29,581 --> 01:10:31,364
Let's go, men!

1069
01:10:31,364 --> 01:10:34,114
(dramatic music)

1070
01:10:45,646 --> 01:10:47,234
- Here they come!

1071
01:10:47,234 --> 01:10:49,984
(dramatic music)

1072
01:10:57,633 --> 01:10:59,114
- That's enough.

1073
01:10:59,114 --> 01:11:01,864
(dramatic music)

1074
01:12:03,192 --> 01:12:06,733
(horses galloping)

1075
01:12:06,733 --> 01:12:07,566
- Charge!

1076
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:10,628
(horses galloping)

1077
01:12:10,628 --> 01:12:13,211
(men shouting)

1078
01:12:17,806 --> 01:12:20,723
(horses galloping)

1079
01:12:42,636 --> 01:12:45,219
(men shouting)

1080
01:12:46,474 --> 01:12:49,391
(horses galloping)

1081
01:13:02,106 --> 01:13:04,344
- Remember, men, hold your fire!

1082
01:13:04,344 --> 01:13:07,203
If any of them get through,
throw the grenades.

1083
01:13:07,203 --> 01:13:08,178
Ready, Yvette?

1084
01:13:08,178 --> 01:13:09,627
- Yes, ready!

1085
01:13:09,627 --> 01:13:12,544
(horses galloping)

1086
01:14:00,115 --> 01:14:02,865
(bombs blasting)

1087
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:11,152
(thrilling music)

1088
01:14:13,364 --> 01:14:16,114
(bombs blasting)

1089
01:14:22,383 --> 01:14:24,883
(guns firing)

1090
01:14:45,121 --> 01:14:47,871
(bombs blasting)

1091
01:14:57,456 --> 01:14:59,956
(guns firing)

1092
01:15:06,839 --> 01:15:09,589
(bombs blasting)

1093
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,980
(guns firing)

1094
01:15:31,523 --> 01:15:34,273
(dramatic music)

1095
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:40,240
(guns firing)

1096
01:15:42,198 --> 01:15:44,948
(dramatic music)

1097
01:15:46,749 --> 01:15:49,249
(guns firing)

1098
01:15:56,853 --> 01:15:59,686
(thrilling music)

1099
01:16:51,314 --> 01:16:53,897
(men cheering)

1100
01:17:04,678 --> 01:17:07,595
(triumphant music)

1101
01:17:17,413 --> 01:17:19,587
- And so, for services to France

1102
01:17:19,587 --> 01:17:21,870
above and beyond the call of duty

1103
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:24,407
and by order of the
President of the Republic,

1104
01:17:24,407 --> 01:17:26,950
we bestow upon you the rank of

1105
01:17:26,950 --> 01:17:29,023
Knight of the Legion of Honor.

1106
01:17:29,023 --> 01:17:31,445
(dramatic music)

1107
01:17:31,445 --> 01:17:34,095
May I add my personal thanks.

1108
01:17:34,095 --> 01:17:36,859
- I think we should thank you, General.

1109
01:17:36,859 --> 01:17:37,945
- Congratulations, Captain.

1110
01:17:37,945 --> 01:17:39,591
