00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,510
<i>(commentator)</i>
Apollo is saying "Come on!"

2
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,519
Apollo is going right. He's going
for another right... another right.

3
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,836
Now he's gone for the left.

4
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,798
Down on one knee.
Lou Filippo in there wiping off the glove.

5
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,915
Hard left and a right combination.

6
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,715
<i>(commentator #2)</i> What is keeping him
up, Bill? I don't know.

7
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,436
He can't even get his gloves up
to protect himself.

8
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,991
Down! Stay down!

9
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,795
Apollo dancing around
with his arms in the air.

10
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,716
Five...

11
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,920
...six... seven...

12
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,235
...eight... nine...

13
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,274
<i>(commentator)</i> Apollo can't believe it.

14
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,390
The champion got a left
to the ribs - his right ribs.

15
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,314
- You OK, champ?
- Yeah, I'm OK. I'm OK.

16
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,715
- Your rib's broken.
- He broke my ribs.

17
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,991
I can't see nothing.
Gotta open my eye. Cut me, Mick.

18
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,588
- I don't wanna do it!
- Go on, cut me.

19
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,712
- Cut me.
- OK. Try it. Cut it.

20
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,274
You're bleedin' inside.
I'm gonna stop the fight.

21
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,437
You ain't stoppin' nothin', man.

22
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,350
- You stop this fight, I'll kill you!
- All right. I won't stop it.

23
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,959
- I'm goin'!
- You wanna go...

24
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,958
- Last round.
- You gotta do it! You gotta get it off!

25
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,116
Get it off!

26
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,074
<i>(commentator)</i> There's the bell
for the 15th and final round.

27
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,518
You better start fightin'. You been
doin' nothin'. You been doin' nothin'.

28
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,758
They look like they've been in a war,
these two.

29
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,990
The champion really tagged him.

30
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,590
Apollo clearly protecting his right side -
his ribs.

31
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,675
- Oh, look at that!
- Body punches!

32
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,672
- Hard left and right.
- See the blood coming out of his mouth.

33
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,155
He's spitting out blood now.

34
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,676
A tremendous right hand from Rocky.

35
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,756
Go for it. Go for it, Rock!

36
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,348
Listen to this crowd! Left to the ribs.

37
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,870
Another to the ribs.
That left hand again. Right to the chin!

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,596
He's got him up against the ropes!
Apollo, the champion...

39
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,111
<i>(Apollo)</i> Ain't gonna be no rematch.
Ain't gonna be no rematch.

40
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,595
<i>(Rocky)</i> Don't want one!

41
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,153
- You went 15 rounds. How do you feel?
- All right.

42
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,432
What were you thinking about
when that buzzer sounded off?

43
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,073
Adrian!

44
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,952
Rocky...

45
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,036
Rocky!

46
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,596
Rocky!

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,069
Rocky!

48
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,432
We have had the privilege
of witnessing the greatest exhibition...

49
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,269
...of guts and stamina
in the history of the ring.

50

Adrian!

51
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,918
Rocky!

52
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,192
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a split decision.

53

Adrian!

54
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,755
Eight for Apollo Creed!

55
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,832
- Those fans out there deserve a rematch.
- Ain't gonna be no rematch. Come on!

56
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,396
I had enough things
in my face today! Adrian!

57
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,956
Rocko! That's my friend. Rocko!

58
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,275
You're breaking my jacket.

59
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,719
Paulie!

60
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,195
- Adrian! Adrian!
- Rocky!

61
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,470
Adrian! Hey, where's your hat?

62
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,354
- I love you!
- I love <i>you.</i>

63
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,636
I love you!

I love you!

66
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,877
Rocky Balboa!

67
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,711
Get 'em outta here! Let him breathe,
will ya? Give him air.

68
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,308
Sit down, Rocky. Sit down.

69
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,510
- Did you think you had it won?
- I don't know.

70
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,031
- How about a statement, Rocky?
- I don't know. I'm at a loss for words.

71
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,312
- Get back there!
- Rocky, did you think you had it won?

72
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,552
- Where's the doctor?
- How's my nose? As bad as Mickey's?

73
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,031
It ain't that horrible.
Now give him a break. Get outta there.

74
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,119
- Is that the worst beating you ever took?
- You'll get worse if you don't get out.

75
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,390
What did you think in the last round?

76
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,080
That I shoulda stayed
at school or somethin'.

77
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,919
- Do you think you have brain damage?
- I don't see any.

78
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,828
- <i>(Apollo)</i> Where is he?
- Apollo, how about a statement?

79
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,996
Get away from me!

80
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,113
Stallion! Stallion!
You got a dull skull, Stallion.

81
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,800
You're lucky, so lucky.
What you did was a miracle.

82
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,593
You're the luckiest man
on the face of the earth.

83
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,632
- Do I look lucky?
- Nobody goes the distance with me.

84
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,228
Get up out of that chair,
and finish this fight.

85
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,828
- Don't, please. Sit down.
- Is he serious?

86
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,316
- Did the bell save you, Apollo?
- Bell nothin'. I can beat that chump.

87
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,193
- I'll fight him any place, any time.
- You mean a rematch?

88
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,675
I said any place, any time, man.
Can you hear?

89
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,360
You said there weren't
gonna be no rematch.

90
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,268
- Look, chump, any place, any time.
- A rematch could be worth millions.

91
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,552
- Well, I'm officially retired now.
- Don't you run out on me now, Stallion.

92
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,558
I gave you a shot the first time.
Now I'll give you a second.

93
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,513
He sure has a lot of energy.
You got nothin' to prove.

94
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,599
I don't care what the hell them judges
said - this is the man that won the fight!

95
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,508
I'm gonna show you how lucky you are!
You're gonna fight me again, chump!

96
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,835
Don't run out on me! Come back here!

97
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,190
Adrian? You better go home...

98
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,198
...cos I'm gonna be busy healin'
here for a while, you know.

99
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,471

- Maybe you better go home with Paulie...

100
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,388
...and get some - wait a minute -
get some sleep, you know?

102
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,435
See you later. See you, Mick.

103
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,509
<i>(slurred)</i> Can you fix my nose?
I'm a little depressed about my nose.

104
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,111
We'll fix that all right.
It's the eye that concerns me.

105
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,196
The eye's great.

106
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,118
I ain't never really felt this good.

107

111
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,956
- You think so?
- Trust me. I was there.

112

Well, <i>I</i> wouldn't want it.

"My good friend Charlie Flynn."

131

- It's just me, Rocky. Listen...

- Could you answer me one question?
- Yeah, sure.

138

Yeah. Yeah.

Thank you.

- You all right?
- Great bein' outside.

143

This coming year you're gonna
make $300,000. This fiscal year.

- Thanks.
- Hope it don't go to your brain.

147
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,038
- Bet that's heavy.
- A bit.

148
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,720
Just think how fast you'll be
when you get it off.

149
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,593
Just a minute. Can I borrow this?
Let me use your head.

150
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,474
- Sign, Rocky. Sign the deal.
- I wanna talk to you a little bit about this.

151
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,751
- It's a standard deal.

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,196
Oh, wow!

297
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,430
Nice house. Really n...

298
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,279
Hey, Adrian,
that's a great spot for the bag.

299
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,676
I could teach you
how to work that bag someday.

300
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,950
Uh, does it have copper plumbing?

301
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,995
Upstairs and down. This whole house
is supported with steel. The whole thing.

302
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,351
- All these floors are solid oak. Solid.
- Yeah?

303
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,519
Mrs Balboa, can I show you the kitchen?
I think you're gonna really like it.

304
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,552
Solid. That's good to know.

305
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,389
Hey, Adrian, that's a great spot for a radio.
Right over there, you know.

306
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,909
Look at these steps. Nice steps.

307
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,190
- Hey, nice kitchen.
- Nice.

308
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,276
Nice kitchen, yes.

309
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,234
- What are taxes every year?
- 1500.

310
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,430
- 1500.
- Hey, Adrian, I like it.

311
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,869
I know a pretty good deal
when I see one, too.

312
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,878
Excuse me. I wanna talk
to my husband for one second.

313
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,549
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure. I got no appointments.

314
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,916
Rocky, you are making
this man's job very easy.

315
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,874
The bank said it will give us
a $16,000 first mortgage at 9<i>1</i> per cent.

316
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,468
That don't matter.
I say we get the house now, huh?

317
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,070
- We didn't even go upstairs.
- That's just details. I'm sure it's nice.

318
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,954
- Details, huh? Are you sure?
- Absolutely. OK?

319
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,356
All right, we'll take the house.
And it better not leak, or else.

320
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,597
I wanted to tell you... Excuse me.
Could you stand over there?

321
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,951
- I gotta talk secretly with my wife.
- Sure. I understand.

322
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,355
Yeah.

323
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,439
I kinda feel stupid talkin' like this
with the lights on and everything...

324
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,633
...but the house here and solid oak floors
and all that stuff, and the plumbing...

325
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,718
...wouldn't be nothin'
without you bein' here.

326
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:10,392
Without you bein' here, I probably...
I wouldn't be here either, you know.

327
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,875
- You don't have to speak.
- No?

328
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,831
<i>(</i># <i>hums wedding march)</i>

329
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,791
OK. Let's go celebrate here.

330
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,152
- I'll beat you to the pool!
- Hey, you guys! Slow down.

331
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,352
Mary Anne. Mary Anne, listen to this.

332
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:36,679
"You didn't beat nobody. Anybody who
knows boxing knows the fight was fixed."

333
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,872
This one came from London.
"You call yourself the champ."

334
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,072
"You're a fake.
The fight was a fake. Go kill yourself."

335
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,556
Wouldn't you rather play with
the children than read hate mail?

336
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,434
"How much did you get to carry that bum
for 15 rounds? You're a disgrace."

337
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,710
Why can't you ignore it?!

338
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,796
Are you serious?

339
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,755
Come on, let me get you in focus there.
All right, I'm ready.

340
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,758
- Are you blind, Rock?
- Are you gettin' wise with me?

341
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,759
Come on! Throw the ball, Swifty. Let me
see your best here. I'm waitin' for ya.

342
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,836
I'm waitin' for ya.

343
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,236
Come on. I'm ready now. I'm just
warmin' up. Are you ready for this?

344
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,511
Keep your mouth closed.
It's comin' in that direction.

345
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,632
- What a shot!
- Now I know the day weren't no waste.

346
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,273
Come on, Swifty.

347
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,193
- Yeah?
- Yes.

348
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,636
Adrian! You did it!

349
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,998
Oh, yeah! I knew you had it in you. You
woke up, you had a smile on your face.

350
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:59,478
I said "Somethin' special's gonna happen
today." I knew it was gonna be different.

351
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,518
If this kid has your good looks
and your good brains...

352
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,519
...and my good left hook,
he's really gonna be somethin'.

353
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,552
Oh, no, what if it's a girl?
What if it's a girl?

354
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,550
Oh, I didn't think about that.

355
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,911
Well, she'll be everything I'm not.
She won't have to be shy.

356
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,157
We could give her singing
and dancing lessons.

357
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,396
How about a new dress every day?

358
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,274
Have to hire a bodyguard when she starts
goin' to school to keep the boys away.

359
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,676
You know how them little boys can be.
A real pest in general.

360
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,588
And if it's a boy,
I'd like him to be just like the father.

361
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,999
Don't you think one dumbbell
in the family's enough, huh?

362
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,119
I'll tell you one thing -
this kid won't get no tattoos.

363
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,949
It ain't gonna be hanging around no
corners or dress like no wise guy like me.

364
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,958
He's gonna be a good somebody like you.

365
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,753
- Like you.
- No, no, no. Like you.

366
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,189
- Like you.
- No, no. Like you.

367
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,436
Like you.

368
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:01,235
Yo, Adrian. We did it. Didn't we?

369
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,319
- How you feel, Rocky?
- Pretty good.

370
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,558
The reason we didn't call was we wanted
to wait till the swelling went down.

371
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,557
- I see.
- You look terrific now.

372
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,069
- Yeah?
- We're gonna make a buck together.

373
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,155
That's good.

374
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,273
I got a deal today from Smart Deal Toy
Company. Did you ever hear of them?

375
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,358
- No.
- Did you ever hear of a Smart Deal Toy?

376
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,119
- No.
- No? Big. They're number one.

377
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,755
And they wanna make a Rocky doll.
You can kick it. You can beat it.

378
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,839
For kids. You can kick it.
You can beat it. It does everything.

379
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,713
- Pretty smart, yeah.
- Takes a terrific beating.

380
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,752
I think it's a great idea.
We're gonna make a lot of money.

381
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,871
Is he ready there?

382
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,389
- Finito.
- How do I look?

383
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,636
- The best.
- Fabulous.

384
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,314
- Adrian, how do I look?
- Different.

385
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,671
- Sensational. Come on, let's get it on.
- OK.

386
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,316
He's gonna be great.

387
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,796
- Don't be nervous.
- Yeah. How do I look?

388
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,275
- I look stupid, don't I?
- Yes.

389
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,759
- You got any deodorant?
- No.

390
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,836
Uh, excuse me.

391
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,110
All right, we're ready.
Let's go, Arthur. In the cage, Rock.

392
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,835
- Just the way we rehearsed.
- Everyone get ready for picture now.

393
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,270
Girls, come on. Look alive, dear.
Girls? Yeah.

394
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,597
A little higher. Show the product. That's it.

395
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,470
Magic time! Look alive.

396
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,318
- Roll, please.
- Speed.

397
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,238
- Beast aftershave. Take one.
- Action!

398
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,316
- Go now?
- Action.

399
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,111
In the mornin' I splash it on
and it makes me... smeel mainly.

400
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,959
"Smeel mainly"? Cut!

401
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,550
Isn't that "smell manly"?
Can you read that, Rock?

402
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,114
- Yeah.
- Well, let's go again.

403
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,950
Excuse me. I know I said it wrong,
but it really don't smell manly.

404
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,709
Do you think this stuff smells like a man?
I'd say absolutely no.

405
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,310
- Are you finished?
- I'm sorry.

406
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,954
- OK. Rolling again.
- Speed.

407
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,833
- Beast aftershave. Take two.
- Action!

408
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,913
In the mornin' I splash it on
and it surrounds my face with class.

409
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,195
Cut!

410
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,077
Action!

411
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,988
And Beast aftershave
will turn the women into beasts.

412
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,114
Cut!

413
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,794
Action!

414
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:26,074
If you want to be the king of the beasts
and smell like a jungle rat...

415
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,430
Cat... rat... cat... They look alike.

416
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,156
Action!

417
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:37,035
In the afternoon when I put it on
to go out with the guys...

418
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:41,711
...and have a rendezvouse...
- Cut! Cut! We're cutting this set.

419
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,912
- We're going to the alternate set.
- I can get it. It's...

420
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,510
- I'm sure you can. Get out of the cage.
- The word "rendezvous"...

421
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,950
Rendezvous over to the other set,
Rock, if you don't mind.

422
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,310
- Sure.
- We've only wasted four hours.

423
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,716
Arthur, let's reorganise.
We're going to the alternate set.

424
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,832
It sounded great inside,
before it come out like that.

425
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,316
Get the damn club away from him
and get the girls into their outfits.

426
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,557
Where is the wardrobe people?
Where are the prop people?

427
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,636
All right, wet him down.

428
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:15,115
- Arthur, step out, please.
- Speed.

429
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,959
Beast aftershave: "The Contender."
Take seven.

430
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,191
Try to get it right. Action!

431
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,479
Hi. My name is Rocky Balboa,
the Italian Stallion.

432
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,388
They say I'm the American dream,
but not cos...

433
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,511
- Can I do it over again?
- Christ! Cut.

434
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,713
No, just keep it rolling. Keep it rolling.
Just read it off the dummy cards.

435
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,513
- Dummy cards?
- Please! Go on.

436
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,275
Wait a minute. I'd like to
explain somethin'. I ain't punchy.

437
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,359
I got what you call, like, I don't know,
a relaxed brain, but I ain't punchy.

438
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,756
- It's just the way I talk here.
- What's the difference?

439
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,792
- Can you just do it the way it's written?
- That ain't right.

440
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,151
- This whole thing here ain't right.
- What isn't right?

441
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,313
Well, you're a rude guy.
I'm trying very hard.

442
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,079
- That's bad manners, ain't it, Adrian?
- Yes.

443
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,792
I'll tell you, I gotta be almost punchy
to be doin' this in front of my wife.

444
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:13,038
You wanna quit? Then quit!
Leave! Get outta here!

445
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,230
I didn't want you in the first place.

446
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,592
You have wasted our time, sir. This is
a complete bust, the whole afternoon.

447
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:24,475
Leonard. Leonard, where are you going?
I want you to take him with you, Leonard.

448
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,875
Take him with you.
He is not a professional.

449
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,755
I only work with professionals. You cost
us thousands because you can't read.

450
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,751
"'Lt's no time to cuss me'
snarled the robber."

451
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:41,273
"'By God, fellas. Grab your rifles and take
colour... cover."' How does that sound?

452
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,072
- It's good.
- Yeah?

453
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,431
Being a good reader's gonna
help me get a good office job.

454
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,233
- Wanna hear some more?
- I can't wait.

455
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,153
OK.

456
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:56,831
"'There ain't no cover' said Brad Lincoln.
'We better head for the canyon."'

457
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,679
- You read nice.
- Thank you. You lie nice.

458
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,756
Thank you.

459
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,830
How far did you go in high school,
Mr Balboa?

460
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,474
- Uh, ninth.
- And one last question.

461
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,955
Do you have a criminal record?

462
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,755
Nothin' worth braggin' about.

463
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,635
Would you be interested in
some sort of manual labour?

464
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,354
Well, I got nothing against
honest manual labour.

465
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:28,878
It's just that I'd like to see if I could make
a livin' sittin' down, like you're doin'.

466
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,116
Can I be honest? No one's
going to offer you an office job.

467
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,835
There's too much competition.
Why don't you fight?

468
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,316
I've read somewhere
you're a very good fighter.

469
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,036
Yeah. Well...

470
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,117
Was you ever punched in the face
500 times a night?

471
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,155
Stings after a while, you know.

472
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,873
Thank you very much for your time.
I appreciate it.

473
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,795
Mr Balboa, I'm very sorry.
We have nothing.

474
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,559
- Are you sure?
- Next.

475
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,516
Look, pal, you gotta be realistic. You got
no high-school diploma, no qualifications.

476
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:20,997
Wouldn't you be more content with
a good-paying menial labour job?

477
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,396
Thanks.

478
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,038
The way I see it is I can get
another job if I wanna.

479
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,948
But do I wanna? Do I wanna be doin'
something I ain't gonna be happy doin'?

480
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,277
Plus, you know,
we need the money <i>now,</i> Butkus.

481
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,395
Dogs don't wanna hear <i>my</i> problems.

482
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,556
Come on.

483
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:45,674
Yeah. I wish I was a canine sometimes.
Gimme a kiss.

484
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,476
- The only job I got's luggin' beef.
- You got nothin' better than haulin' beef?

485
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:55,310
That's all I got and we're cutting back too.
So, Rocky, it'd be from week to week.

486
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,159
That's OK with me, but when can I start?

487
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,477
- How about tomorrow?
- Well, how about today?

488
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,474
OK. We got a load comin' in.
Hey, Paulie, you look kinda skinny there.

489
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,115
- Yeah, he's losin' weight, ain't he?
- Don't bother to thank me.

490
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,836
Hey, thanks a lot, Paulie. You don't
have to thank me for the watch, either.

491
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,716
Quittin' time!

492
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,677
There's the best-lookin' thing
I seen all day.

493
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,795
- You look tired.
- No, no. My face is tired. <i>I</i> feel OK.

494
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,754
- You wanna take a hot bath?
- No, come on. I feel dynamic. Honest.

495
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:54,318
Hey, listen, tomorrow... I was thinking at
work, maybe after work I'll take you out.

496
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,432
You wanna do somethin' nice, huh?
You wanna do that?

497
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,916
- I'd like to do that. How's your stomach?
- Fine.

498
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,395
You look great. Do you know that?

499
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,793
- Hey, Rock, they just like old friends.
- Old friends never tasted this good.

500
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,876
I heard that.

501
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,473
Yo!

502
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,556
Yo, Rock!

503
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,711
You wanted me, Frank?

504
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,796
I gotta let you go.

505
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,359
How come? I'm workin' hard.
I'm doin' good.

506
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,314
Yeah, but we gotta cut back on manpower
and you ain't got enough time in.

507
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,396
Seniority.

508
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,872
How about if I take a cut in pay, all right?

509
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,355
Can't do it. Union rules.

510
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,556
Rules, rules.

511
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,955
- Can I finish out the day?
- Sure.

512
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,676
Hey, Rocky... I'm sorry.

513
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,716
Yeah, me too.

514
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,072
<i>(Paulie)</i> You got more stories
than a book, you know that?

515
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,113
There's my brother-in-law, Rocky.
Gimme the five.

516
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,708
My brother-in-law come to visit me.

517
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,752
How you doin'? How's everything?
How's business? OK?

518
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,393
Yeah.

519
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:19,310
- Lookin' over your old stompin' ground?
- Yeah. Listen, you wanna buy this car?

520
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,159
- I thought you liked it.
- I don't need it no more.

521
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,589
I can't make these right turns
with my bad eye.

522
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,678
Keep hittin' trash cans
and things like that.

523
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,712
- You got problems? You need bread?
- No, everything's OK.

524
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,230
This car'd look great
wrapped around you, wouldn't it?

525
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,352
Look, you need a hand-out,
I'll give you a hand-out.

526
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:42,110
No, I don't need no hand-out, Paulie.
Look, you wanna buy the car?

527
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,516
Sure. Why don't you be smart
and fight again?

528
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,311
That's OK. I don't need to fight no more.
You wanna buy the car?

529
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,635
You wanna pick up the payments?

530
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,992
My sister givin' you a hard time?
If she is, you break her teeth.

531
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:03,790
I appreciate the advice, Paulie,
but I kinda like her teeth where they are.

532
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,957
There you go. You bought yourself a car.

533
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,713
Good car, you know.
Gotta buckle up for safety and all that.

534
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,195
Where you goin'? You need a lift?

535
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,236
Nah.

536
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,676
See you around.

537
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,155
Hey! Say hi to my sister for me!

538
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,237
Hey, listen,
if you two need the car, just ask!

539
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,439
When did you get home?
I thought you were at work.

540
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,472
No, I... I ain't at work no more. I got, uh...

541
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,670
I got canned today.

542
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,030
Oh.

543
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,549
- What happened?
- I don't know. I was...

544
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:07,150
It was nobody's fault. They were
just cutting back. It was economics.

545
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,477
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know. I was, um...

546
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,435
...thinkin' about fightin'.

547
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:18,037
What about your eye? The doctor
said you shouldn't fight any more.

548
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,836
No, no. He <i>recommended</i> I don't fight,
and I recommend that I do.

549
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,191
- You'll go blind.
- Nobody's goin' blind. Honest, I see great.

550
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,880
I see like a beagle or somethin' like that.

551
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,470
Oh, Rocky, you gave me your word
you wouldn't fight any more.

552
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,194
I mean, if we need money,
<i>I</i> could get a job.

553
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,555
You don't have to do that.

554
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:48,634
Oh, sure. I... I can get my job back,
you know, part time, at the pet shop.

555
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,033
But I'm the one
who's supposed to support.

556
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,515
It's just for a little while.

557
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,039
Listen, what if you catch
some pet-shop disease?

558
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:11,312
There are no pet-shop diseases, Rocky.
I mean, I... really, I wanna work.

559
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,554
Well, maybe you're right, you know.

560
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,708
You know what's best, you know.

561
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,433
Could you start dinner?
I'm startin' to get hungry.

562
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,994
I just wanna finish my workout here, OK?

563
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,076
Sure.

564
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,515
Who the hell is that?!

565
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,391
- Avon lady.
- Is that Rocky?

566
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,910
Hey! I don't remember givin' you no key.

567
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,237
Come on up here.
Well, the prodigal son returns!

568
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:00,956
Don't look so bad, do ya? What's that?
A outer-space monster you brought?

569
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,958
That's Butkus, my large dog.
What's that in your ear?

570
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,114
What is it? Just a...
I hear stupid things better.

571
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,198
Well, now, did you come here
to show me that dog?

572
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,232
No. Mick, can I have my locker back?

573
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,749
- What's on your mind?
- Fightin'.

574
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,913
Fightin'? What? You wanna go blind?

575
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,794
- Nobody's goin' blind.
- You heard what I said?

576
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,275
Yeah, and the eye's great. No problem.

577
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,312
Now, listen, every pug thinks
he has one good one left.

578
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,069
Now forget it,
cos your fightin' career is over, kid.

579
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,350
- Is that right?
- I think that's right.

580
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,189
I spend my whole life gettin' a career.
I get one, and you tell me it's over.

581
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,838
What's the matter? You shook the hell out
of the champion of the whole wide world.

582
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,838
- You be happy with that.
- Maybe we can do better this time.

583
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,997
- Or worse. What about that?
- Hey, yo, Mick.

584
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:53,511
I done you a favour last time, you know.
Can you do me one this time?

585
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:58,833
I don't know. You don't understand me.
I wanna show you somethin' now.

586
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,351
Test you. Now, look, you look right there
at the end of my nose, will ya?

587
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,550
- I wanna test you.
- Look at your nose.

588
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,673
You look at my nose. When I bring my
finger in, you tell me when you see it.

589
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,600
- There's the little thing. I see it.
- That's good.

590
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,395
- I told you. It's OK.
- Now, wait. Now we'll try the other lamp.

591
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,159
Now, look here, will ya? Now, tell me...

592
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,196
- I see it.
- No, you see nothin'.

593
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:29,711
Creed would have caved in the whole
side of your face. Now, forget it, kid.

594
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:34,436
You got the heart, but you ain't got
the tooth no more. Now, forget it!

595
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,396
- Is that right?
- That is right.

596
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:42,196
Yeah? Well, maybe it's <i>you</i> who ain't
got it no more, you know that? Huh?

597
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,993
Yeah. That's it.

598
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:51,478
Now, look, you didn't even
see that comin', did ya? No.

599
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:55,310
Well, that was from
a broken-down pug like me.

600
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,398
What do you think
the champ would do to ya?

601
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:08,512
- I don't know. Hurt me bad.
- No. He'd hurt you permanent.

602
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,596
Permanent.

603
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,756
You know, Mick, if...

604
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:22,035
If I can't fight no more... maybe
I can help out around here, you know.

605
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,719
Here? Well, sure, but...

606
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:29,398
You know, you're like royalty here, kid.

607
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,796
You want those guys to see you
carryin' towels and buckets around?

608
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,275
Where's your dignity?

609
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,470
I don't know how to say this,
you know. I just...

610
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,596
I gotta be around it.

611
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,236
I just g...

612
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:54,194
All right, kid.
Will you come back tomorrow, huh?

613
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,156
Thanks a lot, Mick.

614
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,470
Look, as long as I'm gonna be
promoting this fight myself...

615
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,556
...I want more pressure on for a rematch.

616
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:32,469
Hey, we can get the same money
for the two top contenders.

617
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,716
Why go after Balboa? Why?

618
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,877
Because there's still
a lot of people that think he won.

619
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,629
There's people accusin' me of havin'
the fight fixed, of bein' a fake...

620
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,990
...and insultin' my kids at school.

621
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,236
- You wanna hear the truth?
- Yeah.

622
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,989
The truth is that last time
he was damn lucky.

623
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:54,636
Now he's all finished. He's been hangin'
around doin' nothin' for six months.

624
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:58,196
Any trainer worth anything
wouldn't have nothin' to do with him.

625
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:01,357
Now, I say let's go after some new meat.

626
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,756
Forget this bum.

627
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:08,479
Do you think I beat him the last time?
Do you? Hm?

628
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,999
- You got the decision.
- Man, I won, but I didn't beat him!

629
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,920
What are you afraid of, Tony?

630
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,631
- Honest?
- Yeah, honest.

631
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,795
He's all wrong for us, baby.

632
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:35,509
I saw you beat that man
like I never saw no man get beat before...

633
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,757
...and the man kept coming after you.

634
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,838
We don't need that kind of man in our life.

635
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,516
I know what you're feelin'.

636
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,756
Let it go.

637
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,630
Let it go.

638
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,716
You're the champ.

639
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:06,790
Thank you. You're in charge of my public
relations. I want a new campaign started.

640
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:11,869
I want somethin' done publicly to bring
this man out, to jar this man's pride...

641
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,275
...to get the people around him talkin'.

642
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,758
If we use this humiliation tactic,
you're setting yourself up as the bad guy.

643
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,996
Whatever gets him in the ring.

644
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,114
- What's happenin'?
- Hey.

645
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,992
- What?
- Where's your heart?

646
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,873
- What are you talkin' about?
- You heard me.

647
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,672
Well, what's this?

648
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,234
It's kinda funny, don't you think?

649
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,075
<i>(Mickey)</i> Hey, Chico, listen. Hey, listen.

650
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,112
What's with the grin?
How'd you get so happy with yourself?

651
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,959
Let me tell you somethin'.
Snarl more, you see.

652
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:39,232
Now, a good snarl can give you what
the Bible calls a psychological edge...

653
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:43,148
...because you snarl on your punches...
Wait a minute. Hey, Rock!

654
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:48,236
Rock, come here a minute. Show this
Latin lamebrain how to snarl and punch.

655
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,316
Show him that.

656
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:55,556
That's it, you see.
That's ugly! That's a snarl.

657
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:59,150
Hey, John, will you empty them buckets?
They're flowin' over.

658
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,918
- I'll do it.
- Let him do it.

659
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,190
- I got it, Rock.
- Hey, Rock...

660
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,316
Hey, wait a minute.

661
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,233
Now you can take it.

662
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,237
- Whoops.
- Hey!

663
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,390
Can't you think of anything
tougher to say than "whoops"?

664
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,875
Come on, hit that right. Bang!

665
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,756
<i>(Mickey)</i> Wait a minute,
wait a minute. Hold it.

666
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,989
All right. Come on, come on, come on.

667
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,956
Yo, Rock.

668
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,031
Yo, Tony. How you doin'?

669
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,709
How am <i>I</i> doin'? How are <i>you</i> doin'?
I heard you was workin' in this dump.

670
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,796
What are you doin'?

671
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,753
I'm sweepin' up,
makin' a few bucks here and there.

672
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,793
You ain't no janitor. You don't need
a job like this. Besides, you're Italian.

673
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:06,117
- You come back and work for me.
- Well, what would I be doing?

674
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,631
You mean, like, uh...
you know, like, collectin' or somethin'?

675
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,991
What else? Come back, work on
the docks, you get some fresh air.

676
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:18,989
- It stinks in here.
- I appreciate the offer, but, uh...

677
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:22,908
...I can't do that stuff no more.
- It's healthy, huh?

678
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,679
Now, look, I gotta go.
Take it easy, huh, champ?

679
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,394
Yeah. See you around.

680
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,035
Remember that guy, Rock?

681
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,395
Yo!

682
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,072
How's everybody
in the clubhouse tonight?

683
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:59,476
- Oh, fine. How'd your day go?
- A million laughs. It was great.

684
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:02,194
- You need some help with that?
- Yes.

685
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,032
Hey, maybe you oughta stay home
and rest your stomach.

686
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:11,075
- It's just part time. We need the money.
- Yeah, well, maybe you're right.

687
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,629
There we go.

688
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:18,958
That ain't my brand. I like oatmeal.
Listen, why don't we forget all this work?

689
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:22,595
You wanna come home with me now?
Maybe I'll tell you a few jokes...

690
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,029
...and maybe you'll laugh, you know. Huh?

691
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,232
We need a few laughs in our life.
What do you think? Maybe?

692
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,315
- Yes.
- Maybe?

693
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,273
- Maybe.
- Maybe? OK. Let's get outta here, OK?

694
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,470
- OK.
- Here we go.

695
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:39,469
Hey, listen, Adrian. Listen to this one.
Why do cows wear bells?

696
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,478
- Why?
- Cos their horns don't work.

697
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,353
Is that killin' ya? No? Huh?

698
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:50,758
They really used to like it in third grade.
I used to break everyone up with that one.

699

Boy, you guys got the easy life.

Hey, how you guys doin'?
Did anybody move today, you know, huh?

706
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:22,433
How's life in the bowl?
You gotta exercise once in a while.

707
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,358
Would you like a little snack
or somethin'? Here you go.

708

are you drowning down there? Huh?

709

Hey, wanna hear some TV?
Huh? Wanna hear some TV?

714
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,077
Did you bark at anybody today?

715
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:56,149
Adrian! Sometimes I look at Butkus
and I don't think he's a normal canine.

716
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,396
- What do you think he is?
- I don't know.

717

00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,037
<i>... to last five minutes in the ring</i>
<i>with a superior athlete.</i>

731
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,993
<i>The man's runnin', he's hidin'.</i>
<i>He doesn't wanna face me.</i>

732
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:55,272
<i>So I say to you, Rocky Balboa, that</i>
<i>I want the American people to know...</i>

733
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,631
<i>... I want the world to know that</i>
<i>I'm ready to meet you anywhere.</i>

734
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:02,435
<i>Any place, any time, I will meet</i>
<i>and defeat this so-called fighter...</i>

735
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:06,951
<i>... the Italian Stallion, if the man only has</i>
<i>the guts to give me a call. Call me collect.</i>

736
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,991
<i>Call me, Balboa!</i>

737
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:12,510
<i>This would be a legitimate rematch,</i>
<i>the boxer against the puncher.</i>

738
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,200
<i>Everyone wants to see them</i>
<i>back in the ring.</i>

739
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:18,676
<i>But there's only one problem:</i>
<i>Where is Rocky Balboa?</i>

740
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,353
Ugly bum!

741
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,829
You know, I was thinking that, uh...

742
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,399
...I ain't supposed to
do no commercials and...

743
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,478
...I ain't supposed to
work in no meat house.

744
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,114
I'm supposed to be a fighter.

745
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,595
But you... you gave that up.

746
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,072
Mm.

747
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:49,351
I think I'm becomin' a nobody again, too.

748
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:52,392
- In whose eyes? Not mine.
- In mine.

749
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:56,028
In here.

750
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,995
- We'll get by.
- That's just it.

751
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,431
I don't want just to get by
the hard way, you know?

752
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:08,553
I want you to have good things.
I want the kid to have good things.

753
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,240
We'll have 'em.

754
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:14,557
I just think we need 'em now, don't you?

755
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,276
Rocky, please...

756
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,154
You don't have to prove anything.

757
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,756
Adrian, it's all I know.

758
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,514
I don't want you to do it.

759
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,596
It's all I know.

760
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,596
Adrian?

761
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,156
You know...

762
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,793
...I never asked you to stop
bein' a woman, you know?

763
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:49,789
Please, I'm askin' you, please...
don't ask me to stop bein' a man.

764
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,836
Please.

765
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,076
<i>(knocking)</i>

766
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,876
<i>(knocking)</i>

767
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,956
<i>(knocking)</i>

768
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,996
<i>(knocking)</i>

769
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:24,352
I think we oughta knock his block off.

770
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,789
- Absolutely.
- <i>(Adrian)</i> Rocky...

771
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,956
I'm sorry.

772
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:41,196
Let's do it.

773
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:46,230
Apollo! Apollo! Has a site
been chosen for the rematch?

774
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,635
It will be in the Philadelphia Spectrum...

775
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,035
...cos I want this man's
home town to see this.

776
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:54,709
I want all of Philadelphia,
all of America, the whole world...

777
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,559
...to see me destroy this man
after two short rounds.

778
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:02,959
After this fight he's gonna have to donate
what's left of his body to science.

779
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:07,198
Rocky, what do you think about
the fight taking place in the Spectrum?

780
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,959
- Well, I'm very happy about that.
- Why?

781
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,958
Well, it's only about
ten minutes from my house.

782
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:17,319
Apollo, people say that you lost the first
fight, a victim of the southpaw jinx.

783
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,750
- Did fighting a left-hander throw you off?
- Southpaw jinx nothin'!

784
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,952
I took the fight too lightly
and this man was just plain lucky.

785
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:27,436
But this time - this time -
you all will see the real Apollo Creed.

786
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,755
The world's gonna see
the real Apollo Creed.

787
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:34,715
Lightnin' fast and hard to catch.
No playin', no jivin' - just business.

788
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:39,831
Rocky, do you think you have
a chance this time against Apollo?

789
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:43,509
- I don't know. He looks pretty mad.
<i>- (laughter)</i>

790
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:48,395
- Me and Mick, we're gonna try our best.
- His lungs he's gonna punch out.

791
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,876
- Now, who's that? Al Capone?
- I would sweat you.

792
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:56,116
Look here, a lot of people
may not like me, and that's OK.

793
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:00,153
But come November, Apollo Creed will
provide the ultimate gala spectacle...

794
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:03,272
...on Thanksgiving,
in front of this man's home crowd.

795
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,470
I'm gonna drop him like a bad habit.

796
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:09,912
Rocky, your pay is substantial.
What are you gonna do with the money?

797
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:13,953
The first thing I gotta do
is I gotta pay the rent, you know.

798
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:18,039
And then I made this list on the way over.
I was just thinkin' of things to do.

799
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:21,994
I'd like to get a couple of hats
and a motorcycle and...

800
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:25,715
...a couple of quarts of perfume
for Adrian - she likes to smell good.

801
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:29,549
Some Muppet toys - you know,
Ernie and Big Bird and that frog.

802
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:33,389
- What's his name? Kermit or somethin'?
- I don't know.

803
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:38,792
I thought maybe a statue for the church,
and a snow-cone machine for you, Paulie.

804
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:41,593
- You like snow cones, don't you?
- Yeah.

805
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:45,030
Rocky, got anything derogatory
to say about the champ?

806
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,720
Derogatory... Yeah. He's great.

807
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,998
How about some clowning shots, Apollo?

808
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:53,918
Does this look like a circus to you, man?

809
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:57,196
Come November, you're mine.

810
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:02,475
- He's very upset.
- Ah, well.

811
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:09,034
<i>(Mickey)</i> See how smooth
he moves there?

812
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,913
- See how he pumps that jab in your eye?
- Yeah.

813
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,838
You got guts to go back
in the ring with him, kid.

814
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:18,030
Thanks a lot, Mick.

815
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:21,277
You see, your style's
too easy to figure out.

816
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:26,399
Left-handed fighters, they're the worst.
They lead with their face mostly.

817
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:29,876
Tryin' to throw that big left.
Right's no damn good.

818
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:33,035
They oughta outlaw southpaws.

819
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,310
Why didn't you tell me this before?

820
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:38,398
I didn't wanna hurt your feelings.
Now, look...

821
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,239
...to pull this miracle off,
you gotta change everything.

822
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:46,955
You gotta learn to be a right-handed
fighter. This'll confuse Apollo...

823
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,355
...and it'll protect that bad eye.

824
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:54,069
- I can't learn how to fight right-handed.
- What's can't?

825
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:57,033
There ain't no can'ts! There's no can'ts.

826
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:00,516
Now, he will beat you
uglier than you are now.

827
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:04,792
Now, listen, you start fightin' right-handed
and then you change suddenly...

828
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:08,230
...and that'll make history,
but first you gotta get speed.

829
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:10,954
Demon speed. Speed's what we need.

830
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:14,231
We need greasy, fast speed!

831
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:17,751
Now, I'll show ya a trick
how to get some speed in them legs.

832
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:21,236
- Do you have to wear that sweatshirt?
- It brings me luck, you know?

833
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:24,989
You know what it brings? It brings flies.
I want you to try - listen to me.

834
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:27,714
I want you to try to
chase this little chicken.

835
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,839
What do I gotta chase that for?
It's embarrassing.

836
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,757
First, because I said so.

837
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,317
Second, because chicken-chasin' is how
we always used to train in the old days.

838
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,716
You catch this thing,
you can catch greased lightning. Ready?

839
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,912
Well, I'd rather eat it than chase it.
It ain't very mature.

840
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,998
Neither are you very mature!
Listen, get this thing.

841
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:50,476
- I'm a fighter. I ain't a farmer.
- Come on at it! Go on and get him!

842
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:54,309
Get him! Get him! Get him! Come on!
What's the matter with ya? Get him!

843
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,350
Pick him up! Pick him up!

844
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,558
Pull him round!

845
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:04,998
What's the matter? Are you standin' still
or somethin'? Speed! Speed!

846
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,554
Can't you catch a little chicken? Huh?

847
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:10,797
Come on! Move your tail! Move your tail!

848
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,078
You look like a girl out there.
What's the matter with ya?

849
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,430
I feel like a Kentucky fried idiot.

850
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:21,759
Wake up, will ya? Will ya wake up?
Come on! Come on. Give it. Give it!

851
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:24,394
Yo, Rock.
What's the matter with my sister?

852
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:28,878
Well, I wish you'd go talk to her. Adrian
don't like this none. She's started cryin'.

853
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,310
- She don't like me fightin'.
- What's with this domestic stuff?

854
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:35,910
Tend to the business, will ya?!
Jab that till it hurts!

855
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:39,669
500 times without stopping.
Do you hear me? 500 times.

856
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,872
- I wanna use my other arm.
- If you do, I'm gonna chop it off.

857
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,230
- Is that clear?
- I'll figure somethin'.

858
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,920
I wish you would, Paulie. I appreciate it.

859
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:51,277
I'm sorry. Are you finished?
Can we go to work?

860
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:56,110
That would be nice. Now, hit that bag.
Hit it. Jab it till it hurts. Go ahead!

861
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:59,910
- Three... four...
- I want 500 high ones.

862
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:02,998
- Go!
- What was that? Seven or eight?

863
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,953
One, two. One, two.
One, two. Come on. Turn it over.

864
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:14,596
Snap it. Snap it. Come on.
Dig it! Dig it! Dig it!

865
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,311
All right, pick it up.

866
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,556
Come on. Pick 'em up. Pick 'em up.

867
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,513
Faster! Faster! Faster!

868
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,596
Come on! Faster!

869
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,314
Time!

870
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,916
Time!

871
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,151
Get up! Get me another one, all right?

872
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:51,955
- Ease up on these sparrin' partners.
- You just get me another, man.

873
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:03,439
Time! What's the matter?
That bag too fast for ya?

874
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:07,314

You're gonna pound
that sass right out of him.

876
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:20,038
Last time we shoulda won,
but this time you're gonna be scary, kid.

877
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:23,994
You're gonna be a greasy,
fast, Italian monster!

878
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:27,635
You're gonna eat lightning!
You're gonna crap thunder!

879
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,069
We'll have to put you in a cage, kid.

880
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:35,677
- Let's take a break, all right?
- Break? What break?

881
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:40,237
Where are you goin'? We're not finished.
Hey, I said where the hell you goin'?

882
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:05,556
Ooh!

883
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,396
Ohh...

Can't you catch that little squirt?

Hey, dead ass. Get over here.

894
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,555
Hey, are you sick, kid?

895
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,953
Kid, what's the matter with you?

896
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:47,516
- Nothin'.
- Let me tell you somethin', kid.

897
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:53,988
Now, for a 45-minute fight,
you gotta train hard for 45,000 minutes.

898
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:59,148
45,000. That's ten weeks.
That's ten hours a day. You listenin'?

899
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,750
And you ain't even trained one.

900
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,629
I don't know what the hell you're
waitin' for. What are you waitin' for?

901
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,830
I don't know.

902
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,916
Suit yourself.

903
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:14,994
- Yo, Rocky.
- Hey, yo, Paulie. How you doin'?

904
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:19,716
I'm worried about you. I've been watchin'.
Your head ain't screwed on right.

905
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:22,877
Nah, come on. I'm doin' OK.
You know, I've been thinking.

906
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,834
Would you like to work in my corner?
Wanna get involved in this fight?

907
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:31,034
- What? Watchin' you get murdered?
- Oh, come on. I'm doin' OK.

908
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:34,470
My sister got you so guilty,
you're runnin' all over the place.

909
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:36,909
- She'll be all right.
- It ain't all right.

910
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:39,349
Hey, Paulie, it's OK, all right?

911
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:42,950
- It's not OK.
- Just leave Adrian alone, all right?

912
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,595
Yo, Adrian! Where are ya?

913
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:59,235
- Paulie.
- Yeah, Paulie. What the hell you doin'?

914
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:01,669
- What do you mean?
- What the hell you doin'?

915
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:05,554
- About what?
- About messin' up that guy over there.

916
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:09,075
Don't start. I'm just
trying to keep him safe.

917
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,919
Yeah, what?
Feedin' these goddamn squirrels?

918
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:15,350
Did I teach you how to do that?
Ditchin' a guy when he needs your help?

919
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:19,553
- I can't believe my ears.
- You didn't teach me anything, Paulie.

920
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:22,672
- And I never hurt Rocky.
- You're messin' up his brain real bad.

921
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:25,678
- That's not what I'm doing.
- Yeah, don't tell me!

922
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:28,792
- He's gonna get hurt because of you!
- It's not true.

923
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:30,717
- Don't say that!
- I'm sayin' it.

924
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:35,073
- Come across and tell him it's all right.
- If he goes blind, you walk away.

925
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:37,555
I can't. I love him. You don't!

926
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,520
What are you doin'?

927
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:47,710
What are you doin'? What's wrong?

928
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:49,831
Adrian, what's the matter?

929
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:55,350
Come on. Where are your guts?

930
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:57,436
What's your problem, Mick?

931
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,357
- <i>My</i> problem?
- Yeah.

932
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:03,029
You got the problem, kid.
You got a ticker problem.

933
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,720
What's the matter?
You got nothin' left inside?

934
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:09,310
Cos you're trainin' like a damn bum,
you know that?

935
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,396
- Bum?
- A bum.

936
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,639
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I ain't got it no more.

937
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:20,276
All right. Then don't you waste
my time no more. You hear that?

938
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:23,233
Go away!
Go back to the docks where you belong.

939
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:26,716
You go back to bein' a two-bit nothin'!

940
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:31,755
But don't you ever come back here again,
because I'm too old to waste my time...

941
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:35,031
...tryin' to train
a no-good loser like you, you bum!

942
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:37,469
- They want you across the street.
- What's up?

943
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,556
Your wife's sick.

944
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:53,838
Mr Balboa? I'm Dr Cooper. The baby is
fine, even though it's a month premature.

945
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,757
- What is it?
- It's a boy.

946
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:58,075
Holy smoke. I didn't know she could do it.

947
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:00,316
How's Adrian? Where <i>is</i> Adrian?

948
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,795
She's had complications.

949
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,628
Like what?

950
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,069
She was haemorrhaging
when she was brought in.

951
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:12,478
The premature delivery was most likely
caused by strain of overwork...

952
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,718
...and the sudden loss of blood
has caused her to slip into a coma.

953
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,076
Adrian, it's... it's me.

954
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:56,714
They said outside you're very sick, but I...

955
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,916
I don't wanna believe that.

956
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,835
Maybe you're just tired, you know.

957
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:13,513
Don't worry about nothin'.
You just sleep as long as you want, OK?

958
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:16,473
And I'm gonna be here
when you wake up.

You're not doin' any good here.

961
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,636
Let's go see the kid.

962
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:33,115
No. We gotta see him together.

963
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:36,840
It's OK. We gotta see him together.

964
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:54,469
Mr Balboa, visiting hours are over.

965
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,875
Can't I stay? I'll be quiet.

966
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:02,073
I'm sorry. Hospital rules.

967
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,834
I can't do any more of this watchin' stuff.

968
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:15,196
Do you have a chapel?

969
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:18,076
Yes, we do.

970
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,876
Good night.

971
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,756
Hi, Rock.

972
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:53,230
Uh...

973

That Adrian... she's a good girl.

974
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:04,838
Me, you know, I'm sorry for both of ya.

975
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,556
Hm?

976
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:11,117
Well... there's nothin' I can do, is there?

977
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:13,836
Except...

978
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:20,990
I'd like to tell you somethin' once,
and then I ain't gonna say it again.

979
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:24,676
Well, Rocky, you got a... another shot.

980
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,756
It's a second shot.

981
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:31,638
At the, uh... I don't know,
the biggest title in the world.

982
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:36,513
And you're gonna be swappin' punches...

983
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:40,599
...with the most dangerous
fighter in the world.

984
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:47,195
And just in case, you know,
your brain ain't workin' so good...

985
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,754
...all this happens pretty soon.

986
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,551
And you ain't ready.

987
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:57,195
You're nowhere near in shape.

988
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:01,668
So I say, you know, for God's sake...

989
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:06,351
...why don't you stand up and fight
this guy hard, like you done before?

990
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,835
That was beautiful!

991
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:13,678
But don't lay down
in front of him like this!

992
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:17,588
Like a... I don't know,
like some kind of mongrel or somethin'.

993
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:21,156
Cos he's gonna kick your face in pieces.

You know that? That's right.
This guy just don't wanna win, you know.

995

He wants to bury ya.
He wants to humiliate ya.

996
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,951
He wants to prove to the whole world...

...that it was nothin' but
some kind of a freak the first time out.

more than that, kid. A hell of a lot.

But, no, wait a minute. If you wanna
blow it, if you wanna blow this thing...

1005
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,480
...dammit, I'm gonna blow it with ya.

I'll stay with you.

Adrian, it cost six bucks a bottle.

- So, you haven't seen the baby?

- I was waitin' to see him together.
- I seen the kid.

- Yes.

Good evening.
This is Bill Baldwin speaking to you...

1088
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:53,589
...from the Spectrum in Philadelphia,
the site of Superfight II...

1089
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:57,872
...with Rocky Balboa, the challenger,
and Apollo Creed, the world champion.

1090
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,037
My sidekick and partner again tonight -
Stu Nahan.

1091
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:03,628
For those watching tonight's telecast...

1092
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:07,548
...we think you're gonna see a real
great battle in every sense of the word.

1093
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:14,119
Don't worry about nothin'.

1094
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:16,196
It's OK.

1095
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:20,796
I gotta go.

1096
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:27,034
Adrian, I wish the doctor'd
let you go to this fight.

1097
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:29,435
Me too.

1098
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:33,314
You're the man. You're number one.
The champ. The best of all time.

1099
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:36,955
The girls love ya. Men, old people love ya.
Young people love ya.

1100
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:41,119
You're the best. You're the man.
And he's yours. He's yours. He's yours.

1101
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:43,390
This bum shouldn't even be
in the same ring.

1102
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:47,718

who you are tonight. Stick him.

1105

- You're gonna be late for your own fight.

<i>(chanting)</i> Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

1113

The champion has let it be known
to the press and radio...

1114
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:41,914
...that he is in the best shape of his career.

1115
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:48,349
And Rocky Balboa,
I know, is a 5-1 underdog.

1116
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,755
He's a street brawler from Philadelphia.

1117
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:54,112
But can he repeat that incredible
performance of ten months ago?

1118
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:58,028
And, you know, he took a real beating
at the hands of the champion.

<i>Non devi fare la lotta questa sera?</i>

1125

if you could do me a small favour.

a blessin', so if I get beat up tonight...

01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:21,117
<i>Stu, there are many rumours</i>
<i>about this fight.</i>

1138
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:26,109
<i>The most obvious is a desire for Apollo</i>
<i>to draw first blood, to end it quickly.</i>

1139
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:28,910
This would prove that
the last fight was a fluke.

1140

known to millions as the Italian Stallion.

1158

Making his way to the ring.
Why this fighter of limited ability...

1159
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:50,913
...has gained such popularity
is such a mystery.

1160
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:56,115
Rocky Balboa. The folks at the Spectrum
are beginning to chant his name.

1161
01:31:56,240 --> 01:32:01,030
- He has an awful lot of backers here.
- Balboa is wearing a black and gold robe.

1162
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:04,675
He wore a red one the last time
from that meat-packing plant.

1163
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:07,519
Or from the high school
he never graduated from!

1164
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:11,758
31 years of age. There he is shaking
hands with the referee, Lou Filippo.

1165
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:14,952

- I appreciate it.

1171
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:31,875
- Are you ready in here?
- I think so.

1172
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,399
Tonight's our night.

1173
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:37,559
By the sound of the crowd, the champion
is just now coming into the Spectrum.

1174
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:39,716
And the champion, Apollo Creed.

1175
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:43,753
And he looks a little more determined
this time than he did the last time.

1176
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:46,156
- It's Apollo.
- Who'd you expect?

1177
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:48,191
- I was hopin' he wouldn't show.
- Ha!

1178
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:53,718
<i>(trainer)</i> The champ of all time!

1179
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:56,434
Now the champion is
climbing into the ring.

1180
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:00,155
Very determined-looking.
Very serious right now.

1181
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:02,191
<i>Rocky doesn't look too confident.</i>

1182
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:07,553
<i>(trainer)</i> Apollo Creed:
The master of disaster, the best of all time!

1183
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:14,509
You're goin' down, man.
You're goin' down.

1184
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:16,790
Don't let it bother ya, kid.

1185
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:18,956
- Would it bother you?
- Yeah.

1186
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:24,916
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!
Welcome to the Philadelphia Spectrum!

1187
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:26,712
<i>(cheering)</i>

1188
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:29,992
This is your main event of the evening:

1189
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:34,511
15 rounds for the heavyweight
championship of the world!

1190
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:37,154
<i>(cheering)</i>

1191
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:45,353
In the black corner,
the challenger, weighing 202 pounds...

1192
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:49,115
...from the great fighting city
of Philadelphia.

1193
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:51,310
The Italian Stallion...

1194
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:54,750
...Rocky Balboa!

1195
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:57,633
<i>(cheering)</i>

1196
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:10,356
And in the red corner,
weighing 220 pounds...

1197
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:15,914
...a champion who needs no introduction
anywhere in the civilised world...

1198
01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:18,952

01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:25,595

01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:29,269
...Apollo Creed!

1202
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:31,755
<i>(cheering)</i>

1203
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:37,429
Referee Lou Filippo
will give the instructions.

1204
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:51,316
OK, I'm gonna give you the instructions
now, and I expect you to follow 'em.

1205
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:55,877
Watch your low punches and your kidney
punches. Watch your rabbit punches.

1206
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,150
In case of a knockdown,
you go to the corner...

1207
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:00,669
...and stay there until
I tell you to come out.

1208
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:03,234
OK, boys. Let's have a good fight.

1209
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:07,270
You're goin' down.

1210
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:11,711
Good luck to you.

1211
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:15,918
- He's still upset.
- Who cares? Protect that eye.

1212
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:20,511
No matter what happens, don't go back
to fightin' southpaw till I tell ya. Get him.

1213
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:23,438
- <i>(attendant)</i> Good luck.
- He'll try to kill you quick.

1214
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:28,998
If you get through this first round,
then he's ours. Show him who you are.

1215
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:31,076
<i>(buzzer)</i>

1216
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:37,556
Rocky Balboa prays in his corner.
The champion dancing over in his.

1217
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:41,070
We're just seconds away from the fight
of the century: Superfight II.

1218
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:43,509
And there's the bell.

1219
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:47,315
The champion comes over in a hurry
and throws a couple of rights and lefts.

1220
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:52,912
He starts to take command early here.
Moves his feet along the side of the ring.

1221
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:56,715
Rocky's holding that right hand.
He's fighting right-handed!

1222
01:35:56,840 --> 01:36:00,674
The southpaw from Philly
is fighting right-handed!

1223
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:19,595
Break that damn jab! Protect that eye!

1224
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:25,830
- <i>(Apollo)</i> Is that all you got?
- <i>(referee)</i> Break it up there.

1225
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:29,039
You ready to lay down?

1226
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:32,675
A good right hand, another
and another thrown by the champion.

1227
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:35,234
Three good right hands at Balboa.

1228
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:39,349
And Balboa coming back out.

1229
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:42,233
A left and a right to the head.

1230
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:46,672
Balboa appears to be getting hit often, but
he seems to be in pretty good condition.

1231
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:49,633
A hard right hand thrown
by the champion. Another right.

1232
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:51,432
Balboa is in trouble now.

1233
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:55,679
Taking rights and lefts
as the champion begins to open up.

1234
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:58,837
- It was a tremendous right hand.
- Balboa is down!

1235
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:02,795
Get back.

1236
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:06,754
We see Apollo hit that bad left eye
from the first fight.

1237
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:09,713
The eye that was cut the last time.
Balboa getting up.

1238
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:13,196
- Go get him, Rocky!
- Go after him, kid! Go after him!

1239
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:14,469
Yeah.

1240
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:18,996
And the champion starts to move in again.
Going right, left.

1241
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:23,750
He's taking those punches pretty well.
And now Balboa is coming right back!

1242
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:27,156
Right out of the ring. Coming out now.

1243
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:30,590
Balboa's tagged. Left and right
combinations by the champion.

1244
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:32,790
- Another left.
<i>- (bell)</i>

1245
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:36,117
- There's the bell!
- There's the end of the round.

1246
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:41,671
There's a lot of bad blood
between these two.

1247
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:43,392
Good round. Good round.

1248
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:46,512
I can't believe it. He broke my nose again.

1249
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:50,155
Balboa has gotta be in great shape
to withstand that butchery.

1250
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:53,272
That's just what it is.
It's plain old butchery.

1251
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:56,039
Did the switchin' bother you?
You shoulda had him.

1252
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:59,948
You can't be hurt. You follow?
You can't be hurt, cos you are too tough.

1253
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:02,150
Don't let up on him.
This man is dangerous.

1254
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:04,157
Dangerous? <i>I'm</i> dangerous.

1255
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:08,079
- That guy is crazy.
- No. Listen, he's only a man.

1256
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:11,112
You can beat him, because you're a tank.

1257
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:14,437
You're a greasy, fast,
200-pound Italian tank.

1258
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:18,758
- Go through him! Run over him!
- I'm a tank. I'm gonna get him.

1259
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:22,790
- This is it, man!
- <i>(commentator)</i> Here we go. Round two.

1260
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:27,798
Round two. The champion comes back
out. Starting with a left and left and left.

1261
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:31,750
Left to the chin, left to the head.
Coming around now.

1262
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:35,714
He's got that right hand cocked.
He's waiting for that precise moment...

1263
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:39,037
There it is! But here comes Balboa!

1264
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:43,830
You can't hurt me.
He can't hurt me! No way!

1265
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:45,916
Break it up. Break it up.

1266
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:49,836
Break it up. Break clean.

1267
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:54,515
<i>(Apollo)</i> You're too slow!
Man, you're too slow!

1268
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:58,918
Get your cameras ready. Watch this.
Watch this. He's goin' down.

1269
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:02,596
Here it comes!

1270
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:11,269
Rocky!

1271
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:12,833
Get up, Rock! Get up!

1272
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:17,399
Balboa for the second time is down.
Struggling to get up.

1273
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:21,035
Don't get up. Just stay down there.
Just stay down there, chump!

1274
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:23,469
- I told you!
- Beautiful! Beautiful!

1275
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:31,439
Protect that eye, kid! Get at it! The body,
the body, the body! You're a tank, kid!

1276
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:33,756
I told you! I told you!

1277
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:38,799
And here comes the champion.

1278
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:42,795
Here it is. A left and a right
and he's got him back in the corner!

1279
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:45,832
But here comes Balboa again!
Where does he get that stamina?

1280
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:48,155
He's got the champion
trapped in the corner.

1281
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:50,555
And he's breaking left and right.

1282
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:52,636
<i>(chanting)</i> Rocky! Rocky!

1283
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:06,195
Keep it up! Keep it up!

1284
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:13,349
- I'm standing here.
- <i>(commentator)</i> A great second round.

1285
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:16,631
The round is over,
but they're taunting each other.

1286
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:21,278
Everybody in the audience
better get ready for World War III.

1287
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:24,835
I ain't goin' down no more.

1288
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:27,315
Attaboy! Go get him!

1289
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:32,596
<i>(bell)</i>

1290
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:41,436
Come on, kid!

1291
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:52,196
The champion again with a combination
of lefts and rights to the head.

1292
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:58,311
- That was another round for Creed.
- Creed keeps piling up the points, but...

1293
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:06,799
Get him!

1294
01:41:06,920 --> 01:41:08,876
Hit him! Just hit him!

1295
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:15,548
Another round for Apollo Creed.

1296
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:29,556
Here comes Balboa again. Lefts and
rights to the midsection. And those hurt.

1297
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:37,150
<i>(Mickey)</i> Pound the body!

1298
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:41,996
He's won another round.
He now begins to taunt Balboa again.

1299
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,956
Get out!

1300
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:09,832
<i>(bell)</i>

1301
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:15,195
- I'm gonna give that round to Balboa.
- You wonder what's on Creed's mind.

1302
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:17,390
He's lost his first round.

1303
01:42:23,160 --> 01:42:25,116
Go for it, Rock!

1304
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:35,154
Balboa is on his way.

1305
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:42,799
Hands up! Hands up!
Now, just stick and move!

1306
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:45,832
This man is breakin' you up inside!
Now, stick and move!

1307
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:47,552
<i>(bell)</i>

1308
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:49,830
Lightning! Thunder!

1309

Hit him back!

1310
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:15,958
I thought he took a beating ten months
ago, Stu, but tonight it's twice as bad!

1311
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:21,149
Another round for
the champion, Apollo Creed.

1312
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:25,877
The left eye is closed.
Now bust him, understand?

1313
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:31,754
- Stay away from him.
- Don't let him breathe! Get him!

1314

<i>(bell)</i>

01:43:51,640 --> 01:43:53,995
Another round for the champion.

1317
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:12,316
<i>(bell)</i>

1318
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:32,510
You got him beat on points.
You understand?

1319
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:34,915
Stick and move!
Don't go for the knockout!

1320
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:37,759
- He's gonna fall.
- He's breakin' you up inside!

1321
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:39,950
- How's that eye now?
- It works.

1322
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:43,072
- You can't do much more with that.
- I know what I'm doin'.

1323
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:46,510
- You get in trouble one more time...
- Please don't stop nothin'!

1324
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:48,392
Now, listen, let me stop it.

1325
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:50,750
- You're gettin' killed!
- It's my life.

1326
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:55,192
Apollo ahead. All he has to do
is stay away and he retains the title.

1327
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:59,199
- Just stick and move.
- It ain't gonna be like last time.

1328
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:02,710
- Switch now to southpaw anyway.
- No tricks. I ain't switchin'.

1329
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:05,957
- Yeah, but you're fadin' out.
- I don't need no tricks.

1330
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:08,799
- I ain't switchin'.
- You gotta plan. You gotta switch.

1331
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:10,672
He's ready. Believe me.

1332
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:12,995
Don't go for the knockout.
You got him burned!

1333
01:45:13,120 --> 01:45:16,556
They come to the centre of the ring
for the fifteenth and final round.

1334
01:45:16,840 --> 01:45:19,991
- You're goin' down.
- No. No way.

1335
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:22,759
Here we go.
Let's see what Creed does here now.

1336
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:26,236
Creed has started to move in on Balboa.
He's going for the knockout.

1337
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:29,716
The champion comes out
jabbing with that left hand.

1338
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:32,638
- The champion is beating Balboa.
- Now! Now!

1339
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:39,195
Balboa just nearly floored the champ!

1340
01:45:39,320 --> 01:45:41,754
A hook caught
the exhausted champ off guard!

1341
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:44,758
Creed doesn't know where he is!
It's blind instinct.

1342
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:50,273
Balboa is staggering from exhaustion -
but a right to the head of the champion.

1343
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:53,073
Another right, and a left.
He's got him into the corner.

1344
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:55,555
Stay away from him!

1345
01:45:55,680 --> 01:45:59,958
He's got this thing won if he stays away,
but now it is Creed coming back.

1346
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:02,913
- Creed with a left hand.
- Go for it!

1347
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:07,309
What's keepin' these two guys up?
A tremendous moment.

1348
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:09,396
Now!

1349
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:14,873
Here comes Balboa,
but the champion back with another left.

1350
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:19,396
Get away from him!

1351
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:24,791
A right hand! A right hand! It's Creed!
Now it's Balboa! Now it's Creed!

1352
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:29,118
What a tremendous fight!
They're standing toe to toe.

1353
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:33,153
I don't know why the champion
is fighting Balboa's fight.

1354
01:46:37,240 --> 01:46:39,196
Go, Rocky! Go for it!

1355
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:42,836
A tremendous left to the head.

1356
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:44,916
A left.

1357
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:47,276
A left.

1358
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:01,476
One!

1359
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:07,828
Two!

1360
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:10,832
Creed will retain the title!

1361
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:16,717
If neither gets up, it's a draw,
and Creed will win the title automatically!

1362
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:18,996
- Four!
- Get up, man!

1363
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:22,554
Get on your feet!

1364
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:24,518
Five!

1365
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:27,234
- Balboa reaches for another!
- Get up, Rock!

1366
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:30,990
Six!

1367
01:47:32,240 --> 01:47:34,913
- Now the champ is trying to get up!
- Seven!

1368
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:37,998
Get up, Rocky!

1369
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:42,714
Eight!

1370
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:47,751
Nine!

1371
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:50,155
The champ is going. And he's down!

1372
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:52,236
Ten!

1373
01:47:57,480 --> 01:48:00,517
He made it!
Rocky Balboa has shocked the world!

1374
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:03,632
He is the new heavyweight
champion of the world!

1375
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:06,916
Ladies and gentlemen...

1376
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:12,114
...in a stunning upset,
scoring a win by knockout...

1377
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:15,391
...the new heavyweight
champion of the world...

1378
01:48:17,320 --> 01:48:18,389
Yo, Creed.

1379
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:23,951
Good luck.

1380
01:48:24,720 --> 01:48:27,678
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1381
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:30,997
I can't believe this is happenin'. I can't...

1382
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:36,593
And I just wanna say thanks to Apollo.
For fightin' me, Apollo.

1383
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:41,036
I wanna thank...
thank Mickey for trainin' me.

1384
01:48:42,360 --> 01:48:45,716
- <i>(man)</i> We love you, Rock!
- Yeah, and I love youse, too.

1385
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:47,717
<i>(cheering)</i>

1386
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:50,195
Most of all I wanna thank God.

1387
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:54,635
Except for my kid bein' born...

1388
01:48:56,200 --> 01:48:59,909
...this is the greatest night
in the history of my life.

1389
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:04,914
I just wanna say one thing...
to my wife who's home.

1390
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:10,239
Yo, Adrian! I did it!

1391
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:13,557
I love you. I love you.
