1
00:02:35,148 --> 00:02:38,028
Here in Malaysia, there is an almost
overwhelming sense of euphoria...

2
00:02:38,988 --> 00:02:41,868
as the newly-elected prime minister
has given this nation hope...

3
00:02:42,828 --> 00:02:45,706
promising to raise
the substandard minimum wage...

4
00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:47,603
and end child labor
once and for all...

5
00:02:47,638 --> 00:02:49,466
Already considered a living saint...

6
00:02:49,546 --> 00:02:52,426
he has become this small country's
greatest hope...

7
00:02:52,461 --> 00:02:54,266
for a thriving future
in the new millennium...

8
00:02:54,346 --> 00:02:57,106
for a thriving future
in the new millennium...

9
00:02:57,186 --> 00:02:59,024
Get closer, Jaco.

10
00:02:59,104 --> 00:03:01,984
This is disgusting.
How could you let this happen?

11
00:03:02,944 --> 00:03:05,824
I have negotiated
my butt off, Giorgio.

12
00:03:06,784 --> 00:03:09,664
I've tried bribes, I've tried gifts.
I even sent him some pet oxen.

13
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:12,544
I mean, they love that crap
in Malaysia.

14
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:14,384
But he won't budge.

15
00:03:14,464 --> 00:03:17,342
Listen, 50 percent of my inventory
is manufactured...

16
00:03:17,377 --> 00:03:19,182
in sweatshops
on the Malaysian border.

17
00:03:19,262 --> 00:03:21,102
Something has got to be done.

18
00:03:21,182 --> 00:03:24,027
If Malaysia goes, what is next?

19
00:03:24,062 --> 00:03:25,942
My entire panty line
is made in Vietnam.

20
00:03:25,977 --> 00:03:27,822
We'll all go bankrupt
within a year.

21
00:03:27,902 --> 00:03:30,780
The Malaysian must be
eliminated, Mugatu.

22
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,545
What? No, I don't
have time for this.

23
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,460
Perhaps you'd rather go back
to turning out novelty neckties.

24
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,225
But my new fall line is almost due.

25
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,140
And I trust you would like to live
to see your spring line as well?

26
00:03:46,098 --> 00:03:48,978
The Malaysian prime minister
visits New York in 14 days.

27
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:51,778
Do it then.

28
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:54,738
Fourteen days? That's Fashion Week.
It's impossible! I have a show!

29
00:03:54,773 --> 00:03:57,583
It's perfect. Invite him
to be your guest of honor.

30
00:03:57,618 --> 00:04:00,498
That's not enough time.
It takes months to train an operative.

31
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:04,301
What about Fabio?

32
00:04:04,336 --> 00:04:06,176
Too smart.
This is a rush job.

33
00:04:06,256 --> 00:04:09,101
He's got to be extremely
dim-witted.

34
00:04:09,136 --> 00:04:12,016
- You know the profile,Jacobim.
- A beautiful, self-absorbed...

35
00:04:12,976 --> 00:04:15,856
simpleton who can be manipulated
and molded like Jell-O.

36
00:04:16,776 --> 00:04:17,654
Or cookie dough.

37
00:04:17,734 --> 00:04:20,579
- Or Play-Doh.
- Any kind of dough.

38
00:04:20,614 --> 00:04:23,494
The point is,
we need an empty vessel...

39
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:26,374
a shallow, dumb, vacuous moron.

40
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:30,214
And when he's finished,
we'll dispose of him.

41
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:31,094
But who?

42
00:04:31,174 --> 00:04:33,014
I mean, where in all of God's
green goodness...

43
00:04:33,094 --> 00:04:35,972
am I gonna find someone
that beef-headed?

44
00:04:36,932 --> 00:04:38,772
am I gonna find someone
that beef-headed?

45
00:04:38,852 --> 00:04:41,732
Derek, I just have a few more
questions, if that's okay.

46
00:04:41,767 --> 00:04:43,572
Cool.

47
00:04:43,652 --> 00:04:45,492
So when did you know
you wanted to be a model?

48
00:04:45,572 --> 00:04:48,452
It would have to be the first time
I went through the second grade.

49
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,290
I caught my reflection in a spoon
while I was eating my cereal...

50
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,010
and I remember thinking,
"Wow, you're ridiculously good-looking.

51
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,930
Maybe you could do that
for a career"

52
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:58,890
Do what?

53
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,815
- Be professionally good-looking.
- Right.

54
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,728
What would you say your
trademark is, if you have one?

55
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,608
Well, I guess the look
I'm best known for is Blue Steel.

56
00:05:07,643 --> 00:05:10,488
What's that look like?

57
00:05:12,408 --> 00:05:15,253
That's impressive.

58
00:05:15,288 --> 00:05:17,128
And then there's Ferrari
and Le Tigre.

59
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:20,088
Le Tigre's a lot softer.
It's a bit more of a catalog look.

60
00:05:21,046 --> 00:05:23,926
- I use it for footwear sometimes.
- Can I see that?

61
00:05:34,486 --> 00:05:37,364
Look, without Derek Zoolander, male
modeling wouldn't be what it is.

62
00:05:38,284 --> 00:05:40,124
He is a fashion icon.

63
00:05:40,204 --> 00:05:42,044
So, do you spend a lot of time
working on these looks...

64
00:05:42,124 --> 00:05:43,964
thinking about them?

65
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:46,924
Sure. I've been working on Magnum
for at least eight or nine years.

66
00:05:47,884 --> 00:05:50,729
Magnum? That's intriguing.
Can I see that?

67
00:05:50,764 --> 00:05:53,642
Are you kidding? I shouldn't
even be talking about it.

68
00:05:54,602 --> 00:05:56,442
It's nowhere near ready.

69
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,402
It's almost like
there's a light around him...

70
00:05:59,437 --> 00:06:01,242
He exudes beauty.

71
00:06:01,322 --> 00:06:03,162
I think about Derek
every time I design a collection.

72
00:06:03,242 --> 00:06:06,122
You may be familiar with the belief
that some aboriginal tribes hold.

73
00:06:07,082 --> 00:06:09,960
It's the concept that a photo
might steal a part of your soul.

74
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,800
What are your thoughts on that...

75
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,725
as someone who gets his picture
taken for a living?

76
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,640
That Blue Steel look he does...
Oh, my Gosh, the style and the hair...

77
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,400
It's almost like the new afro for
the white man, but it's beautiful.

78
00:06:23,358 --> 00:06:26,238
Well, I guess I would have to answer
your question with another question.

79
00:06:27,198 --> 00:06:30,078
How many "abo-digitals"
do you see modeling?

80
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:33,918
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the
fashion industry's biggest night...

81
00:06:33,953 --> 00:06:34,798
the VH1 Fashion Awards...

82
00:06:34,878 --> 00:06:37,758
the VH1 Fashion Awards...

83
00:06:39,676 --> 00:06:42,556
There he is, three-time
Male Model of the Year...

84
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:44,396
Derek Zoolander...

85
00:06:44,476 --> 00:06:45,356
He's like music.

86
00:06:45,436 --> 00:06:48,316
Proud owner of Blue Steel, the look
that made him the legend he now is...

87
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:51,116
He's almost too good-looking.

88
00:06:51,196 --> 00:06:52,076
Hey, Paco!

89
00:06:52,156 --> 00:06:55,034
That would be my main deterrent
in considering a relationship.

90
00:07:06,514 --> 00:07:09,394
And that's who Derek Zoolander is
defending his title against tonight...

91
00:07:10,354 --> 00:07:12,192
Hansel...

92
00:07:12,272 --> 00:07:14,632
- Hansel, right here!
- All right, all right.

93
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,992
The rookie sensation
who has burned his way...

94
00:07:17,072 --> 00:07:18,912
into the eye sockets
of the fashion world...

95
00:07:18,992 --> 00:07:21,872
and left them clawing
their faces for more...

96
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:24,752
Mugatu sucks!
Support the prime minister!

97
00:07:24,787 --> 00:07:27,630
Mugatu uses slave labor!

98
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,390
Down with Mugatu!

99
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:34,350
You hate to see something like that
at an event like this...

100
00:07:34,385 --> 00:07:37,110
Ugly protesters
bothering beautiful people.

101
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,070
There's no denying Jacobim Mugatu
has used cheap Malaysian workers...

102
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,908
to make his and most
of the garment industry's clothes...

103
00:07:46,788 --> 00:07:47,668
Hey, Steve, how are you doing?

104
00:07:47,748 --> 00:07:50,628
You're going for your fourth
Male Model of the Year award.

105
00:07:50,663 --> 00:07:53,508
- Are you nervous?
- I have butterflies in my basket...

106
00:07:54,468 --> 00:07:55,348
but I think I'm doing okay.

107
00:07:55,428 --> 00:07:58,306
We also hear you're working on a new
look. Can you tell us about it?

108
00:07:58,341 --> 00:08:01,186
Actually, I can't, Steve,
because it's not yet perfected.

109
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:03,026
But I can tell you
that it's called Magnum and...

110
00:08:03,106 --> 00:08:04,946
Shut, baby, shut!

111
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,866
If I tell you anything else,
this guy's gonna kill me.

112
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:08,786
Got that right.
How are you doing, Steven?

113
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:11,746
- Maury Ballstein, Balls Models.
- A man who needs no introduction.

114
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:14,624
Maury, you've handle every important
male model for the last 30 years.

115
00:08:15,544 --> 00:08:17,384
- Derek's chances tonight?
- Let me tell you something.

116
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:20,309
Nobody can touch Derek.
Nobody! I gotta get inside.

117
00:08:20,344 --> 00:08:23,224
I'm "shvitzing" like a "shmedrik"
with all these lights.

118
00:08:32,822 --> 00:08:35,667
Are you worried about Hansel?

119
00:08:35,702 --> 00:08:37,542
Not as much
as I'm worried about Gretel.

120
00:08:37,622 --> 00:08:40,502
Hey, put that Hansel and Gretel
line in your article.

121
00:08:41,462 --> 00:08:42,342
I want people to know
how funny I can be.

122
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:45,300
Oh, believe me, they'll know.
It hits newsstands tomorrow.

123
00:08:45,335 --> 00:08:48,180
Excuse me, Mr. Mugatu.
Mr. Mugatu, Matilda Jeffries.

124
00:08:48,215 --> 00:08:50,020
Time magazine.

125
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,940
Any comment on Prime Minister
Hassan's wage increases...

126
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,860
for Malaysian garment workers?
- No, he has no comment.

127
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,820
Let him speak for himself. Would you
like to see the prime minister...

128
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,620
out of power so you can continue
exploiting cheap Malaysian workers?

129
00:09:00,653 --> 00:09:03,498
Hey, Mugatu! Screw you
and your little dog too!

130
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:05,875
Look out!
She's got an egg!

131
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,218
Oh, my God! Let go of me!

132
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:11,178
Yes!

133
00:09:12,138 --> 00:09:13,978
Wow.

134
00:09:14,058 --> 00:09:16,416
I just can't tell you how much
this means to me...

135
00:09:16,451 --> 00:09:18,776
to be the first recipient
of this beautiful award.

136
00:09:18,856 --> 00:09:21,736
We have a serious problem
on our hands, Maury.

137
00:09:21,771 --> 00:09:24,616
This Malaysian thing
is getting out of hand.

138
00:09:24,651 --> 00:09:25,496
I hear you,Jaco.

139
00:09:25,576 --> 00:09:28,421
What this, the Slashie, mean...

140
00:09:28,456 --> 00:09:31,336
is you consider me
the best actor slash model...

141
00:09:33,254 --> 00:09:36,014
and not the otherway around.

142
00:09:36,094 --> 00:09:38,939
His proposed wage increase
could ruin all of us.

143
00:09:38,974 --> 00:09:41,854
I need it taken care of soon.
I have people to answer to.

144
00:09:43,774 --> 00:09:44,654
Now to the important stuff.

145
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:47,094
These ain't no slashes, folks...

146
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,452
These are the pure breeds...

147
00:09:49,532 --> 00:09:52,412
Here are the nominees
for Male Model of the Year...

148
00:09:53,372 --> 00:09:55,212
Young, hot, brash...

149
00:09:55,292 --> 00:09:58,172
With more covers in his first year
than any rookie model ever...

150
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:02,012
and an attitude that says,
"Wiho cares? It's only fashion..."

151
00:10:02,972 --> 00:10:05,815
That Hansel's so hot right now.

152
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,730
I hear a lot of words
like "beauty"and "handsomeness"...

153
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,570
and "incredibly chiseled features..."

154
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,530
To me, that's like a vanity,
a self-absorption...

155
00:10:13,565 --> 00:10:16,290
that I try to steer clear of...

156
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,250
I dig the bungee... For me,
it's just the way I live my life...

157
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,088
I grip it and I rip it...
I live it with a lot of flair...

158
00:10:21,168 --> 00:10:24,013
I live it on the edge,
where I gotta be...

159
00:10:24,048 --> 00:10:26,928
I wasn't like every other kid,
who dreams about being an astronaut...

160
00:10:28,848 --> 00:10:31,728
I was always more interested in what
bark was made out of on a tree...

161
00:10:34,608 --> 00:10:36,446
Richard Gere's
a real hero of mine... Sting...

162
00:10:36,526 --> 00:10:39,371
Sting would be another person
who's a hero...

163
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:42,286
The music that he's created...
I don't really listen to it...

164
00:10:42,321 --> 00:10:45,166
But the fact that he's making it,
I respect that...

165
00:10:45,201 --> 00:10:47,006
I care desperately about what I do...

166
00:10:47,086 --> 00:10:48,926
Do I know what
product I'm selling? No...

167
00:10:49,006 --> 00:10:50,844
Do I know what I'm doing today? No...

168
00:10:50,924 --> 00:10:53,804
But I'm here,
and I'm gonna give it my best shot...

169
00:11:01,444 --> 00:11:03,284
Over the past decade...

170
00:11:03,364 --> 00:11:06,244
male modeling has had a shadow
cast over it by one man...

171
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:08,082
and five syllables...

172
00:11:08,162 --> 00:11:11,042
Der-ek Zoo-lan-der...

173
00:11:12,002 --> 00:11:14,847
Modeling, to me, isn't just
about being good-looking...

174
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,762
or having a lot of fun and
being really, really good-looking...

175
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,360
The calender was great...

176
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,320
because it gave people a chance
to see a side of my versatility...

177
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:31,200
The original Greek word for model
means "misshapen ball of clay..."

178
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,040
and I try to think about that every
time I get in front of a camera...

179
00:11:35,075 --> 00:11:37,920
Three-time Male Model of the Year...

180
00:11:47,478 --> 00:11:50,358
And the award goes to...

181
00:11:54,196 --> 00:11:57,076
Hansel.

182
00:12:11,474 --> 00:12:14,354
Thank you, Lenny.

183
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:17,114
Wow!

184
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:20,074
You know, a lot of people said
winning this award...

185
00:12:20,109 --> 00:12:22,954
four years in a row
couldn't happen.

186
00:12:23,914 --> 00:12:26,792
Well, I guess I showed...

187
00:12:40,232 --> 00:12:43,110
I think we've found
our solution, Ballstein.

188
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,910
No, not Derek.

189
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,870
He's perfect, and you know it.
Now make it happen.

190
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,670
It stings me like a fissure
in my ass, but you're right.

191
00:12:53,705 --> 00:12:56,550
He's ready.

192
00:13:14,746 --> 00:13:17,106
Who am I?

193
00:13:17,141 --> 00:13:19,466
I don't know.

194
00:13:19,546 --> 00:13:22,426
I guess I have
a lot of things to ponder.

195
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:26,266
Hey, the results are in, amigo!

196
00:13:26,301 --> 00:13:29,144
What's left to ponder?

197
00:13:31,064 --> 00:13:33,944
Nice comeback!

198
00:14:43,936 --> 00:14:44,816
I can't stand Hansel!

199
00:14:44,896 --> 00:14:47,774
I know, right? Riding in
on that scooter like he's so cool.

200
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:51,579
- And the way Hansel combs his hair.
- Or, like, doesn't.

201
00:14:51,614 --> 00:14:54,494
It's like, "ex-squeeze" me, but
have you ever heard of styling gel?

202
00:14:56,374 --> 00:14:59,254
I'm sure Hansel's heard
of styling gel. He's a male model.

203
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:01,094
Earth to Brint.
I was making a joke.

204
00:15:01,174 --> 00:15:04,052
Earth to Meekus.
Duh, okay? I knew that.

205
00:15:05,012 --> 00:15:06,852
Earth to Brint.
I'm not so sure you did...

206
00:15:06,932 --> 00:15:09,812
'cause you were all,
"I'm sure he's heard of styling gel"...

207
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:12,657
like you didn't know it was a joke.

208
00:15:12,692 --> 00:15:15,572
I knew it was a joke, Meekus.
I just didn't get it right away.

209
00:15:15,607 --> 00:15:18,467
- Earth to Brint...
- Would you guys stop it already!

210
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:21,356
Did you ever think that maybe
there's more to life...

211
00:15:21,391 --> 00:15:24,210
than being really, really,
ridiculously good-looking?

212
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,930
Maybe we should be doing something
more meaningful with our lives.

213
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,688
Like helping people.

214
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:37,648
Uh, Derek, what people?

215
00:15:38,568 --> 00:15:41,413
I don't know.
People who need help.

216
00:15:41,448 --> 00:15:44,328
Models help people. They make them
feel good about themselves.

217
00:15:45,288 --> 00:15:47,128
They also show them
how to dress cool...

218
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,048
and wear their hair
in interesting ways.

219
00:15:49,128 --> 00:15:50,966
I guess so.

220
00:15:51,046 --> 00:15:53,926
You know what could really help you
sort through these important issues?

221
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:55,766
What?

222
00:15:55,846 --> 00:15:58,726
Orange mocha frappuccino!

223
00:16:00,646 --> 00:16:01,526
Yeah!

224
00:16:01,606 --> 00:16:04,486
Come on, man! Come on!

225
00:17:10,636 --> 00:17:13,516
"Derek Zoolander: a model, idiot"

226
00:17:32,714 --> 00:17:35,594
- Brint!
- Huh?

227
00:17:47,072 --> 00:17:49,952
Rufus, Brint and Meekus
were like brothers to me.

228
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:54,752
And when I say brother, I don't
mean like an actual brother...

229
00:17:54,787 --> 00:17:57,630
but I mean it like the way
black people use it...

230
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,430
which is more meaningful, I think.

231
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,390
If there's anything that this
horrible tragedy can teach us...

232
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,230
it's that a male model's life
is a precious, precious commodity.

233
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,070
Just because we have chiseled abs...

234
00:18:12,028 --> 00:18:13,868
and stunning features...

235
00:18:13,948 --> 00:18:16,828
it doesn't mean that we can't die
in a freak gasoline fight accident.

236
00:18:19,668 --> 00:18:22,548
So today, ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to take this opportunity...

237
00:18:23,508 --> 00:18:26,388
to announce my retire...

238
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:36,946
Hansel.
He's so hot right now.

239
00:18:37,906 --> 00:18:40,786
I would like to take this oppor...

240
00:18:40,821 --> 00:18:43,629
People!

241
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,544
I'd like to announce my retirement
from the male modeling profession.

242
00:18:48,464 --> 00:18:50,304
What?

243
00:18:50,384 --> 00:18:53,264
I'm pretty sure there's a lot more
to life than being good-looking.

244
00:18:54,224 --> 00:18:56,984
And I plan on finding out
what that is. Thank you.

245
00:18:57,064 --> 00:18:58,902
Mr. Mugatu! Mr. Mugatu!

246
00:18:58,982 --> 00:19:01,862
If I could just have
a moment of your time, please, sir.

247
00:19:01,897 --> 00:19:04,742
Just one minute of your time,
please, sir!

248
00:19:07,622 --> 00:19:10,502
- What do you want?
- I'm trying to talk to Mugatu...

249
00:19:11,462 --> 00:19:13,302
but he's tougher to get to
than the president.

250
00:19:13,382 --> 00:19:16,260
Oh, I thought you were gonna tell me
what a bad "eugoogolizer" I am.

251
00:19:16,295 --> 00:19:18,100
A what?

252
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,060
A "eugoogolizer"'
One who speaks at funerals.

253
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,860
Or did you think I'd be too stupid
to know what a "eugoogoly" was?

254
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,700
How could you have written
those terrible things about me?

255
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,535
Derek, my editor
put that headline on it, okay?

256
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,338
I'm sorry. I know
it came off kind of harsh.

257
00:19:35,418 --> 00:19:37,258
Yeah, well, fortunately for you,
not too many people I know...

258
00:19:37,338 --> 00:19:40,218
read your little Time magazine,
or whatever it's called.

259
00:19:40,253 --> 00:19:42,058
Look, maybe you could do me a favor.

260
00:19:42,138 --> 00:19:45,018
All I'm trying to do is get some
background information on Mugatu.

261
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:46,856
Mugatu? If you knew anything...

262
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,816
you know Mugatu's the one designer
who's never hired me.

263
00:19:50,776 --> 00:19:51,656
Come on. There's gotta be...

264
00:19:51,736 --> 00:19:53,576
Sorry, lady. Not interested.

265
00:19:53,656 --> 00:19:56,536
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got
an after funeral party to attend.

266
00:20:01,336 --> 00:20:03,174
Go back home?
You're overreacting...

267
00:20:03,254 --> 00:20:05,094
I want to do something meaningful
with my life, Maury...

268
00:20:05,174 --> 00:20:08,019
I have deeper thoughts on my mind.

269
00:20:08,054 --> 00:20:09,894
The other day, I was thinking
about volunteering...

270
00:20:09,974 --> 00:20:12,819
to help teach underprivileged
children to learn how to read.

271
00:20:12,854 --> 00:20:15,614
Just thinking about it was the most
rewarding experience I've ever had.

272
00:20:15,694 --> 00:20:18,572
Derek, I don't think you're cut out
for that kind of thing.

273
00:20:18,607 --> 00:20:20,412
I mean, maybe I could even have
my own institute.

274
00:20:20,492 --> 00:20:24,372
We could call it the Derek Zoolander
Center for Kids Who Can't Read Good.

275
00:20:26,252 --> 00:20:28,092
What about us?
We built this place together.

276
00:20:28,172 --> 00:20:31,052
Look out! Tushy squeeze!

277
00:20:32,012 --> 00:20:33,850
When I met you,
you were a junior petite...

278
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,770
who couldn't book
a goddamn Sears catalog...

279
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,690
and who couldn't turn left
to save his ass.

280
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,650
- Now look at you.
- I can turn left!

281
00:20:40,685 --> 00:20:42,490
Yeah, right.

282
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,410
Please. Some male models go left
at the end of a runway...

283
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,330
others go right.

284
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,288
You got a lot of gifts, but hanging
a louie just isn't one of them.

285
00:20:49,323 --> 00:20:52,133
Sit down!

286
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:55,048
Hey, you want to hear
some great news?

287
00:20:57,888 --> 00:21:00,768
Mugatu wants you
for his new campaign.

288
00:21:00,803 --> 00:21:03,648
Didn't you hear me, Maury?
I just retired.

289
00:21:04,606 --> 00:21:06,446
But this is Mugatu, Derek.

290
00:21:06,526 --> 00:21:08,366
Right now, this guy is so hot...

291
00:21:08,446 --> 00:21:10,286
he can take a crap,
wrap it in tin foil...

292
00:21:10,366 --> 00:21:12,206
put a couple of fishhooks on it...

293
00:21:12,286 --> 00:21:15,166
and sell it to Queen Elizabeth
as earrings.

294
00:21:17,086 --> 00:21:19,966
Derek, you're the laughing stock
of the entire fashion world.

295
00:21:22,844 --> 00:21:25,724
What do we do
when we fall off the horse?

296
00:21:31,484 --> 00:21:34,364
We get back on.

297
00:21:35,284 --> 00:21:38,162
Sorry, Maury.
I'm not a gymnast.

298
00:21:39,122 --> 00:21:42,002
I'm going back home. I need
to get in touch with my roots.

299
00:21:42,037 --> 00:21:44,882
Figure out who I am.
See you around, Maury.

300
00:22:15,558 --> 00:22:18,438
Hey, Pop!

301
00:22:22,278 --> 00:22:25,156
It's me.

302
00:22:26,116 --> 00:22:28,996
Scrappy, Luke...

303
00:22:29,956 --> 00:22:31,796
you remember your brother, right?

304
00:22:31,876 --> 00:22:33,716
What do you want?

305
00:22:33,796 --> 00:22:36,641
I thought maybe I could work
the mines with you guys.

306
00:22:36,676 --> 00:22:39,554
All the Zoolander men together
again, like when we were kids.

307
00:22:41,474 --> 00:22:44,354
Times have changed. You wouldn't
last one day down those coal pits.

308
00:22:45,314 --> 00:22:48,159
Can't you even pretend
to be happy to see me, Pop?

309
00:22:48,194 --> 00:22:51,074
Damn it, Derek, I'm a coal miner,
not a professional television actor.

310
00:22:53,954 --> 00:22:56,832
Do us all a favor
and get out of here.

311
00:23:00,632 --> 00:23:02,472
Pop, wait, please!

312
00:23:02,552 --> 00:23:05,397
Give me a chance.

313
00:23:05,432 --> 00:23:08,312
I won't let you down.
I promise.

314
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,950
Hold very still. Very still.

315
00:23:16,985 --> 00:23:19,830
I'm working right now. This...

316
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:21,670
- Ouch!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

317
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,590
Did my pin get in the way
of your ass?

318
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:26,548
Do me a favor and lose
five pounds immediately...

319
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:29,428
or get out of my building like now!

320
00:23:29,463 --> 00:23:30,308
Get out!

321
00:23:30,388 --> 00:23:33,268
I'm so tired!
No, Todd, not now!

322
00:23:33,303 --> 00:23:35,068
It's Maury.

323
00:23:35,148 --> 00:23:36,028
Tell me something good.

324
00:23:36,108 --> 00:23:38,953
You may have to start
looking for someone else.

325
00:23:38,988 --> 00:23:41,866
There is no one else.
The show is in ten days, Ballstein.

326
00:23:42,826 --> 00:23:44,666
Jaco, I hear you,
but the kid's mixed up.

327
00:23:44,746 --> 00:23:47,626
He went home... He's talking
about going off to ponder...

328
00:23:47,661 --> 00:23:49,466
and tutoring underprivileged
retards or some shit.

329
00:23:49,546 --> 00:23:52,426
I don't care what it takes.
Get him back..

330
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:55,271
We're running out of time.
Capisce?

331
00:23:55,306 --> 00:23:58,184
Yeah, I capisce...
Now if I could only "ca-piss"'

332
00:23:58,219 --> 00:24:01,064
My prostate's flaring up
like a frickin' tiki torch.

333
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,904
Give me a little pee-pee.
Come on, a couple of drops.

334
00:24:06,824 --> 00:24:09,704
That's what I'm talking about!

335
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:12,584
That's what I'm talking about!

336
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,178
Surprise!

337
00:24:49,978 --> 00:24:52,858
What the hell's
the matter with you?

338
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,216
Pacheco back to pass...

339
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:07,136
He's feeling pressure from Pressman...

340
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:09,056
He's looking for his all-American
John De Rosa, the wide receiver...

341
00:25:09,136 --> 00:25:10,976
He's got him wide open
in the middle of the field...

342
00:25:11,056 --> 00:25:12,896
Big rush...

343
00:25:12,976 --> 00:25:13,856
Who's winning the match?

344
00:25:13,936 --> 00:25:16,814
Hits Kevin Conley,
the tight end down in there...

345
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,694
State.

346
00:25:22,574 --> 00:25:24,934
I think I'm getting
the black lung, Pop.

347
00:25:24,969 --> 00:25:27,294
It's not very well ventilated
down there.

348
00:25:27,374 --> 00:25:29,214
For Christ's sake, Derek,
you've been down there one day.

349
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:32,172
Talk to me in 30 years.

350
00:25:42,692 --> 00:25:45,572
Moisture is the essence
of wetness...

351
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:51,330
and wetness is the essence
of beauty...

352
00:26:03,808 --> 00:26:06,688
Why'd you have to come back
to this damn town?

353
00:26:07,648 --> 00:26:10,493
I wanted to make
a new life for myself.

354
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:13,348
I'm sorry I was born
with this perfect bone structure.

355
00:26:13,383 --> 00:26:16,168
That my hair looks better
done up with gel and mousse...

356
00:26:16,248 --> 00:26:19,126
than hidden under a stupid hat
with a light on it!

357
00:26:20,086 --> 00:26:22,966
All I ever wanted to do
was make you proud of me, Pop.

358
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:25,846
With what? Your male modeling?

359
00:26:26,806 --> 00:26:29,686
Prancing around in your underwear
with your wiener hanging out?

360
00:26:33,526 --> 00:26:36,404
You're dead to me, boy.

361
00:26:37,364 --> 00:26:40,244
You're more dead to me
than your dead mother.

362
00:26:42,164 --> 00:26:45,044
I just thank the Lord she didn't
live to see her son as a mermaid.

363
00:26:48,884 --> 00:26:51,762
Mer-man.

364
00:27:05,162 --> 00:27:08,040
Who am I?

365
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,480
Hello? Derek,you hearing me?

366
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:23,318
- God?
- God?

367
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:26,278
What the shit are you talking about?
It's me... Maury...

368
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:28,118
I hope you're finished
touching your roots...

369
00:27:28,198 --> 00:27:30,038
because Mugatu's making you
an offer you won't believe...

370
00:27:30,118 --> 00:27:32,998
You gotta get your tuckus back here...

371
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:39,676
Well, to tell you the truth,
I was a little hesitant at first.

372
00:27:40,636 --> 00:27:43,516
I mean, you've never hired me
before, and I've been around...

373
00:27:45,436 --> 00:27:47,276
For ages and ages.
You've been around for a long time.

374
00:27:47,356 --> 00:27:49,196
I never wanted anything from you.

375
00:27:49,276 --> 00:27:51,116
And now that you're retired,
I can't have you.

376
00:27:51,196 --> 00:27:53,036
And it's funny
how it switches like that.

377
00:27:53,116 --> 00:27:55,959
But now the forbidden fruit
must be tasted.

378
00:27:55,994 --> 00:27:58,874
Well, when Maury told me
what you were willing to do, I...

379
00:28:03,674 --> 00:28:06,554
Are you not aware that I get farty
and bloated with a foamy latte?

380
00:28:06,589 --> 00:28:09,449
My mistake,Jacobim.

381
00:28:09,484 --> 00:28:12,312
Your mistake indeed!

382
00:28:20,912 --> 00:28:23,757
Yes, Derek.

383
00:28:23,792 --> 00:28:26,635
What Maury said
I was willing to do for you.

384
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:29,550
Let's get back to the reason
that we're really here.

385
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:35,310
Without much further ado,
I give you...

386
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:39,150
the Derek Zoolander Center
for Kids Who Can't Read Good.

387
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:52,588
What is this?

388
00:28:55,428 --> 00:28:57,266
A center for ants?

389
00:28:57,346 --> 00:29:00,226
What?

390
00:29:02,146 --> 00:29:05,026
How can we be expected to teach
children to learn how to read...

391
00:29:05,986 --> 00:29:08,866
if they can't even fit
inside the building?

392
00:29:10,786 --> 00:29:12,624
- Derek, it's just a small...
- I don't want to hear your excuses!

393
00:29:12,704 --> 00:29:15,584
The center has to be at least...

394
00:29:17,504 --> 00:29:20,384
three times bigger than this.

395
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:25,184
- He's absolutely right.
- Thank you.

396
00:29:27,104 --> 00:29:27,982
I have a vision.

397
00:29:28,062 --> 00:29:30,942
And so do I.
Let me show you mine.

398
00:29:32,862 --> 00:29:35,622
I can't help you, lady...
I don't know nothing about Mugatu...

399
00:29:35,702 --> 00:29:37,542
But you've represented every
male model in each of his campaigns.

400
00:29:37,622 --> 00:29:40,502
You must have some kind
of a relationship with him.

401
00:29:40,537 --> 00:29:42,342
Even if I did,
why would I talk to you?

402
00:29:42,422 --> 00:29:45,300
Shame on you how you picked on
Derek Zoolander in that story.

403
00:29:45,335 --> 00:29:47,140
He's a sweet simpleton
who never hurt a fly.

404
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,065
Please don't change the subject,
Mr. Ballstein.

405
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,460
What about Mugatu's exploitation
of sweatshop workers in Malaysia?

406
00:29:52,495 --> 00:29:54,820
- Do you have an opinion on that?
- You wanna hear an opinion?

407
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,780
With a push-up bra, you could have
a nice rack of lamb going on there.

408
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,618
Let me show you
the future of fashion.

409
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:06,418
Let me show you...

410
00:30:06,453 --> 00:30:08,258
Derelicte!

411
00:30:08,338 --> 00:30:10,178
It is a fashion, a way of life...

412
00:30:10,258 --> 00:30:13,103
inspired by the very homeless,
the vagrants...

413
00:30:13,138 --> 00:30:16,016
the crack whores that make
this wonderful city so unique.

414
00:30:18,856 --> 00:30:21,736
And I want you, Derek,
to be the face...

415
00:30:21,771 --> 00:30:24,616
the image... nay,
the spirit of Derelicte!

416
00:30:26,536 --> 00:30:28,376
It'll be your glorious comeback.

417
00:30:28,456 --> 00:30:30,296
Sounds cool.

418
00:30:30,376 --> 00:30:33,254
Derek, I'd like you to meet
Katinka Ingabogovinanana.

419
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:39,014
She'll be your day-to-day
on the campaign.

420
00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:41,859
Let's get this model on his way!

421
00:30:41,894 --> 00:30:44,254
The big show
is in eight days, Derek...

422
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:46,612
Like a caterpillar
becomes a butterfly...

423
00:30:46,692 --> 00:30:49,572
so must you become Derelicte!

424
00:30:50,532 --> 00:30:52,372
So you want me
to sleep in the gutter?

425
00:30:52,452 --> 00:30:55,332
No... We're sending you
to a very exclusive day spa...

426
00:30:56,252 --> 00:30:58,092
So exclusive,
no one knows about it...

427
00:30:58,172 --> 00:31:01,052
Our little secret, okay?

428
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,110
- Matilda, hey.
- Hey, Arch, what's up?

429
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:11,030
Nothing. I've just
been up for a few days...

430
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:13,990
putting together these background
articles on Mugatu you asked for.

431
00:31:14,025 --> 00:31:16,835
Very thorough, Archie.
Thank you.

432
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:19,748
It's weird. I couldn't get
any info on him before 1995.

433
00:31:19,783 --> 00:31:21,588
It's like he just appeared
out of the blue.

434
00:31:21,668 --> 00:31:24,548
- Really? That's strange.
- Yeah.

435
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,348
- Matilda Jeffries.
- Keep pulling the sweater.

436
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:30,308
- Excuse me?
- Eventually the whole thing will unravel...

437
00:31:32,228 --> 00:31:35,106
You mean, if you pull the thread,
the whole thing will unravel?

438
00:31:36,026 --> 00:31:38,906
Now you're talking, sister. If you
want to know more, go to Pier 12.

439
00:31:39,866 --> 00:31:42,746
Things aren't what they seem.

440
00:31:50,424 --> 00:31:53,304
What kind of spa is this?

441
00:31:54,264 --> 00:31:56,104
It's designed
for deep, deep relaxation.

442
00:31:56,184 --> 00:31:59,064
Come, let's get you loosened up.

443
00:32:08,662 --> 00:32:11,542
Good boy.

444
00:32:40,298 --> 00:32:43,178
Oh, I'm sorry.

445
00:32:45,098 --> 00:32:47,978
Matilda, what are you doing here?

446
00:32:48,013 --> 00:32:50,858
I was...

447
00:32:53,696 --> 00:32:56,576
What are you doing here, Derek?
I thought you quit the business.

448
00:32:56,611 --> 00:32:59,456
Haven't you heard? I'm the new face
of Mugatu's Derelicte campaign.

449
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:07,101
What do you mean, Derek?
You said Mugatu never hires you.

450
00:33:07,136 --> 00:33:10,014
Well, I guess he changed his mind.
It's the world's biggest campaign.

451
00:33:10,974 --> 00:33:13,819
What is this? Who are you?

452
00:33:13,854 --> 00:33:16,734
This is private property. Nils!

453
00:33:19,614 --> 00:33:22,494
I suggest you and your Kmart
Jaclyn Smith Collection outfit...

454
00:33:23,454 --> 00:33:26,332
stay the hell away
from Derek Zoolander.

455
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,932
How do you feel, Derek?

456
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,570
When's the seaweed wrap?

457
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:43,490
You shut up now.

458
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:46,450
I want you to relax...

459
00:33:46,485 --> 00:33:49,330
and breathe deeply.

460
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:56,048
Breathe deeply.

461
00:34:01,808 --> 00:34:04,688
- I like this song.
- Of course you do.

462
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:13,326
Welcome to your relaxation time...

463
00:34:14,246 --> 00:34:17,126
Let this wonderful
'80s classic soothe you...

464
00:34:18,086 --> 00:34:20,966
Just a nice, warm, happy time...

465
00:34:21,001 --> 00:34:23,846
Happy, happy...

466
00:34:27,684 --> 00:34:30,564
Nothing to worry about at all...

467
00:34:31,524 --> 00:34:34,404
Just relax...

468
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:38,244
Hey there, Derek...
My name is Lil' Kleatus...

469
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:42,084
I'm just a kid who wants you to know
the truth about child labor laws...

470
00:34:44,002 --> 00:34:46,882
They're silly and outdated...
In the good old days...

471
00:34:46,917 --> 00:34:49,762
kids as young as five
could work as they pleased...

472
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:53,482
from textile factories
to iron smelts...

473
00:34:53,562 --> 00:34:55,402
Yippee! Hooray!

474
00:34:55,482 --> 00:34:58,360
But today, the age-old right
of children to work is under attack...

475
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,160
From the Philippines to Bangladesh,
in China and India...

476
00:35:03,195 --> 00:35:06,040
and South America too...

477
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,840
But you can help
these children, Derek...

478
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,800
by killing the prime minister
of Malaysia...

479
00:35:11,835 --> 00:35:14,678
- He is bad...
- What?

480
00:35:15,638 --> 00:35:18,483
You learn martial arts...

481
00:35:18,518 --> 00:35:21,398
Prime minister of Malaysia bad!

482
00:35:21,433 --> 00:35:23,238
Martial arts good!

483
00:35:23,318 --> 00:35:26,198
Kill naughty man!

484
00:35:28,118 --> 00:35:29,956
Obey my dog!

485
00:35:30,036 --> 00:35:31,876
On the runway,
you have one objective...

486
00:35:31,956 --> 00:35:34,836
Do not be distracted
by the beautiful celebrities...

487
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,516
Do as you've been trained to do and
kill the Malaysian prime minister!

488
00:35:44,396 --> 00:35:47,274
Karate chop! Bad, man! Awful man!

489
00:35:48,234 --> 00:35:51,114
In your little blue suit
and your spiky black hair... Kill!

490
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,994
And you're
a super-hot ninja machine!

491
00:36:03,592 --> 00:36:06,437
- Derek, are you in there?
- Hold your horses!

492
00:36:06,472 --> 00:36:09,352
- Derek, please open the door!
- What a cuckoo dream.

493
00:36:12,232 --> 00:36:14,992
- What?
- Hey, are you okay?

494
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:16,912
I've been trying to reach you
for a week.

495
00:36:16,992 --> 00:36:18,830
A week? What,
are you having a whack attack?

496
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,750
I saw you this afternoon, dum-dum.

497
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:23,675
That was last Friday.

498
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:26,590
Earth to Matilda.
I was at a day spa.

499
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:29,470
Day. D-A-I-Y-E. Okay?

500
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,228
Look, I think I know
what this is about...

501
00:36:33,308 --> 00:36:36,188
and I'm very complimented
but not interested.

502
00:36:38,108 --> 00:36:39,948
- What?
- I can't sleep with you, okay?

503
00:36:40,028 --> 00:36:42,908
- My head is killing me and...
- What are you talking about?

504
00:36:42,943 --> 00:36:44,748
Okay, if you just want
to fool around a little bit...

505
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:47,673
Hey, I don't want to sleep with you!

506
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:49,546
I've been trying to tell you
you've been missing for a week.

507
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:52,506
Would you look at the date. Mugatu's
Derelicte show is tomorrow night.

508
00:36:53,426 --> 00:36:56,306
I don't care what the date says.

509
00:36:57,266 --> 00:37:00,146
You have 1,200 messages...

510
00:37:02,066 --> 00:37:03,906
That is a bit above average.

511
00:37:03,986 --> 00:37:06,864
- Derek, what happened in that spa?
- I don't know.

512
00:37:06,899 --> 00:37:08,704
A little massage,
some aromatherapy.

513
00:37:08,784 --> 00:37:11,664
I mean, look, lady, you can't just
come barging into people's lofts...

514
00:37:12,624 --> 00:37:14,464
wanting sex,
then changing your mind...

515
00:37:14,544 --> 00:37:16,384
then telling them that they've been
in a day spa for a week...

516
00:37:16,464 --> 00:37:19,344
You have been in a day spa
for a week.

517
00:37:19,379 --> 00:37:20,222
So what?

518
00:37:20,302 --> 00:37:23,182
Do you understand that the world
does not revolve around you...

519
00:37:23,217 --> 00:37:26,062
and your "do whatever it takes,
ruin as many people's lives"...

520
00:37:27,022 --> 00:37:28,862
so long as you can make a name
for yourself as a journalist...

521
00:37:28,942 --> 00:37:30,782
no matter how many friends
you lose...

522
00:37:30,862 --> 00:37:33,622
or people you leave dead
and bloodied along the way...

523
00:37:33,702 --> 00:37:36,580
just so long as you can make a name
for yourself as a journalist...

524
00:37:36,615 --> 00:37:38,420
no matter how many friends
you lose...

525
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,380
or people you leave dead and
bloodied and dying along the way?

526
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,100
I told you I was sorry
about that article.

527
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,020
Enough! My head hurts!

528
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,945
And if it indeed is
what day you claim it is...

529
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:53,858
I have a pre-runway party
to attend, if you'll excuse me.

530
00:37:56,738 --> 00:37:58,578
- By the way...
- What?

531
00:37:58,658 --> 00:38:00,498
With your complexion...

532
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:02,418
you really shouldn't be wearing
your hair pulled back that tight.

533
00:38:02,498 --> 00:38:04,338
What are you talking about?

534
00:38:04,418 --> 00:38:06,258
It pulls back the skin
on your forehead...

535
00:38:06,338 --> 00:38:08,176
creating a tension
which clogs the pores.

536
00:38:08,256 --> 00:38:11,136
That's why you have some light
pattern dryness around your scalp.

537
00:38:11,171 --> 00:38:14,016
Do you mind?

538
00:38:21,656 --> 00:38:24,534
Cool.

539
00:38:34,134 --> 00:38:37,014
I do not like snoopy reporter
with lack of fashion sense.

540
00:38:37,974 --> 00:38:40,852
Not one little bit.

541
00:38:40,887 --> 00:38:43,732
Not one little bit.

542
00:38:44,692 --> 00:38:46,532
Hey, I just E-mailed you
all those searches...

543
00:38:46,612 --> 00:38:49,457
on the male models who've
appeared in Mugatu campaigns.

544
00:38:49,492 --> 00:38:52,372
It's pretty weird. It seems
like all of Mr. Mugatu's models...

545
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:56,170
have a bad habit of dying young
in freak accidents.

546
00:38:56,205 --> 00:38:59,050
What?

547
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:07,690
- Wait a second.
- What?

548
00:39:16,328 --> 00:39:19,208
- Oh, shit. I gotta go.
- What's going on?

549
00:39:22,088 --> 00:39:23,928
I don't want to hang out, okay?

550
00:39:24,008 --> 00:39:26,851
I just need to speak
with Derek Zoolander, please!

551
00:39:26,886 --> 00:39:29,766
I just thought the way you handled
losing that award to Hansel...

552
00:39:30,726 --> 00:39:32,566
and then you sort of laid low
for a while...

553
00:39:32,646 --> 00:39:34,446
and then made your comeback...

554
00:39:34,526 --> 00:39:36,366
It was so courageous.

555
00:39:36,446 --> 00:39:38,286
Look, I gotta go pee...

556
00:39:38,366 --> 00:39:41,246
but I'd really like to continue
talking about this conversation.

557
00:39:43,164 --> 00:39:46,009
Yeah.

558
00:39:46,044 --> 00:39:48,924
- Everything cool, Derek?
- It's great, Biff. Thank you.

559
00:39:50,844 --> 00:39:52,684
Hey, Derek. You rule.

560
00:39:52,764 --> 00:39:55,644
Thanks, Paris.
I appreciate that.

561
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:58,487
- Hey, Derek.
- Hey, Maurice.

562
00:39:58,522 --> 00:40:01,402
- Hey, my man.
- What's happening?

563
00:40:02,362 --> 00:40:04,202
Derek, back on top, man.

564
00:40:04,282 --> 00:40:06,122
Thanks, Billy. You rock.

565
00:40:06,202 --> 00:40:09,047
No, you rock. When are you gonna
drop Magnum on us, buddy?

566
00:40:09,082 --> 00:40:11,962
Not yet. Gotta tame the beast
before you let it out of its cage.

567
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,640
- Excuse me, bra.
- You're excused.

568
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,320
And I'm not your bra.

569
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,158
Whatever, dude. Whatever.
Peace. God bless.

570
00:40:31,118 --> 00:40:33,998
Hey, Hansel, I'm sorry you didn't
get Mugatu's Derelicte campaign.

571
00:40:35,918 --> 00:40:37,758
Maybe next time.

572
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:38,718
What's that?

573
00:40:38,798 --> 00:40:41,678
Mugatu's Derelicte campaign.
Sorry you didn't book it.

574
00:40:42,638 --> 00:40:45,481
Oh, yeah?
I've never even heard of it.

575
00:40:45,516 --> 00:40:48,396
Me and my friends have been too busy
bathing off of St. Barts...

576
00:40:48,431 --> 00:40:50,236
with spider monkeys
for the past two weeks.

577
00:40:50,316 --> 00:40:53,076
Tripping on acid changed
our whole perspective on shit.

578
00:40:53,156 --> 00:40:56,036
So I guess you can "dere-lick"
my balls, capitan...

579
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:03,714
Would you hold this for me?

580
00:41:04,674 --> 00:41:07,554
I can "dere-lick" my own balls,
thank you very much.

581
00:41:11,394 --> 00:41:14,239
You think you're
too cool for school.

582
00:41:14,274 --> 00:41:17,152
But I got a news flash
for you, Walter Cronkite.

583
00:41:20,992 --> 00:41:23,872
You aren't.

584
00:41:26,752 --> 00:41:29,632
Who are you trying
to get crazy with, ese?

585
00:41:30,592 --> 00:41:33,470
Don't you know I'm loco?

586
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:37,270
Hey, I got a wacky idea.

587
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:41,110
What say we settle this
on the runway...

588
00:41:41,145 --> 00:41:43,990
Han-solo?

589
00:41:52,628 --> 00:41:54,468
Stop it.

590
00:41:54,548 --> 00:41:57,428
Are you challenging me
to a walk-off...

591
00:41:57,463 --> 00:42:00,273
Boo-lander?

592
00:42:00,308 --> 00:42:02,148
Don't do this, Derek.

593
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:05,071
Listen to your friend Billy Zane.

594
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:07,986
He's a cool dude.
He's trying to help you out.

595
00:42:09,906 --> 00:42:12,786
Oh, yeah. That's a walk-off
challenge, my friend.

596
00:42:17,546 --> 00:42:19,904
Ten minutes.
Old Members Only warehouse.

597
00:42:19,939 --> 00:42:22,264
You oughta remember that.
You're a dinosaur.

598
00:42:22,344 --> 00:42:25,224
Let's go. Open up.

599
00:42:28,104 --> 00:42:30,984
I heard some mad stories
about this kid. He's too limber.

600
00:42:31,019 --> 00:42:33,864
Put a cork in it, Zane!

601
00:42:35,782 --> 00:42:37,622
It's a walk-off.

602
00:42:37,702 --> 00:42:40,582
This is urgent, ma'am.
Do you have any...

603
00:42:45,382 --> 00:42:46,262
Hey, Matilda.

604
00:42:46,342 --> 00:42:48,702
What is this?
Where is ever yone going?

605
00:42:48,737 --> 00:42:51,060
Good luck, Derek!
Kick Hansel's ass!

606
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,940
Thanks, Rico. I'll try.

607
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,860
You want to see the real world
of male modeling?

608
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:57,820
The one they don't show you
in magazines or the E Channel?

609
00:42:57,855 --> 00:42:59,660
Yeah, I guess. Derek, please.

610
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:02,620
I have something really important
to talk to you about.

611
00:43:02,655 --> 00:43:03,500
Not now, Matilda.

612
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,423
Han-sell-out is about
to have his Han-sell-ass...

613
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:09,338
handed to him on a platter
with french-fried potatoes.

614
00:43:09,373 --> 00:43:12,218
Katinka, thought you might
want to know...

615
00:43:12,253 --> 00:43:14,058
your boy Zoolander's rolling.

616
00:43:14,138 --> 00:43:17,018
It's a walk-off.

617
00:43:38,094 --> 00:43:39,934
All right,
who's gonna call this sucker?

618
00:43:40,014 --> 00:43:42,894
If nobody has any objections...

619
00:43:42,929 --> 00:43:45,774
I believe I might be of service.

620
00:43:51,534 --> 00:43:54,377
Now, this'll be a straight walk-off,
old school rules.

621
00:43:54,412 --> 00:43:57,292
First model walks, second model
duplicates, then elaborates.

622
00:43:59,212 --> 00:44:01,572
Okay, boys, let's go to work.

623
00:44:01,607 --> 00:44:03,932
Age before beauty, goat cheese.

624
00:44:04,012 --> 00:44:06,892
Whatever.

625
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,690
Right.

626
00:44:38,528 --> 00:44:41,406
Playskool, baby.

627
00:45:09,204 --> 00:45:11,044
You gotta cut me. I can't see.
I'm blind out there.

628
00:45:11,124 --> 00:45:14,002
Evian.

629
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:18,802
It's okay.

630
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,160
- Where am I?
- It's okay.

631
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,120
- Kickin', Hoss.
- I'm going monk.

632
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,880
I gotta go monk. Prayer.
Pray to the Great Spirit.

633
00:45:56,198 --> 00:45:59,078
Do it, Hansel.

634
00:46:01,956 --> 00:46:04,836
Why is he sticking his hand
in his pants?

635
00:46:06,756 --> 00:46:09,636
Do it, Hansel.

636
00:46:26,874 --> 00:46:29,754
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Derek, you're not a kid anymore.

637
00:46:30,712 --> 00:46:33,592
You could hurt yourself out there.

638
00:46:34,552 --> 00:46:37,432
I can do this, Tyson.

639
00:46:46,072 --> 00:46:48,950
Thank God I wore underwear today...

640
00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:00,430
He's going for it.

641
00:47:19,626 --> 00:47:22,506
Oh, my God.

642
00:47:30,186 --> 00:47:33,066
Disqualified.

643
00:47:38,784 --> 00:47:39,664
- Derek, come on.
- Come on.

644
00:47:39,744 --> 00:47:41,584
- Derek, come on.
- Come on.

645
00:47:41,664 --> 00:47:43,504
What's going on?

646
00:47:43,584 --> 00:47:45,424
I think Katinka wants to kill you.

647
00:47:45,504 --> 00:47:48,384
Good. I deserve to die if I can't
beat Han-suck-ass in a walk-off.

648
00:47:51,262 --> 00:47:52,142
Derek, that's not true.

649
00:47:52,222 --> 00:47:55,102
The guy had to pull his underwear
out of his butt just to beat you.

650
00:47:59,902 --> 00:48:02,782
And all he had to do
was turn left.

651
00:48:03,742 --> 00:48:05,580
What do you mean?

652
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:08,505
I'm not an ambi-turner.

653
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:11,420
It's a problem I had
since I was a baby.

654
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:14,180
I can't turn left.

655
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:17,105
Derek, that's nothing
to be ashamed of.

656
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:20,020
I'm sure there are a lot of people
out there who can't turn...

657
00:48:23,858 --> 00:48:26,738
There have got to be some people
out there, just like you...

658
00:48:27,698 --> 00:48:30,578
who can't turn... turn left.

659
00:48:35,378 --> 00:48:38,256
If you want answers,
come to Saint Adonis Cemetery now...

660
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:41,101
- Wait! Who are you?
- Who was that?

661
00:48:41,136 --> 00:48:44,016
I'm not sure. I have to get
to Saint Adonis Cemetery.

662
00:48:44,976 --> 00:48:47,856
I'm gonna take you to my apartment.
You can stay there until I get back.

663
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:49,696
Can I come with?

664
00:48:49,776 --> 00:48:52,654
I don't want to be alone tonight.

665
00:49:04,134 --> 00:49:06,979
"Pedro Scialfa"'

666
00:49:07,014 --> 00:49:09,892
He died when he was 29.

667
00:49:12,772 --> 00:49:15,617
"Vin Correjo"'

668
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:18,532
"Derriere Extraordinaire"'

669
00:49:22,372 --> 00:49:25,215
Ninety-two minus sixty-three.

670
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:28,130
None of them ever made it past 30.

671
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:31,935
I did.

672
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:33,770
Who are you?

673
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:34,730
It's not important.

674
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:37,690
Are you a ghost?

675
00:49:39,608 --> 00:49:40,488
He called, Derek.

676
00:49:40,568 --> 00:49:43,413
Let's take a walk.

677
00:49:43,448 --> 00:49:46,328
You think Zoolander's in trouble?

678
00:49:46,363 --> 00:49:48,168
Think again.

679
00:49:48,248 --> 00:49:51,128
What you've stumbled upon goes way
deeper than you could ever fathom.

680
00:49:51,163 --> 00:49:52,968
The fashion industry
has been behind...

681
00:49:53,048 --> 00:49:55,926
every major political assassination
over the last 200 years.

682
00:49:56,886 --> 00:49:59,766
And behind every hit,
a card-carrying male model.

683
00:50:01,686 --> 00:50:03,526
Okay, that's impossible.

684
00:50:03,606 --> 00:50:05,446
Oh, yeah?
Listen and learn, sweetness.

685
00:50:05,526 --> 00:50:08,406
Abe Lincoln wanted to abolish
slavery, right?

686
00:50:09,366 --> 00:50:11,204
But who do you think made the
powdered wigs and leg stockings...

687
00:50:11,284 --> 00:50:14,164
worn by our country's
early leaders?

688
00:50:15,084 --> 00:50:17,929
Mugatu!

689
00:50:17,964 --> 00:50:20,844
Slaves, Derek.

690
00:50:21,804 --> 00:50:24,684
Without their free labor,
prices would have gone up tenfold.

691
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:27,579
So the powers that be
hired John Wilkes Booth...

692
00:50:27,614 --> 00:50:30,442
the original model/actor,
to do Mr. Lincoln in...

693
00:50:33,322 --> 00:50:36,202
I'll go on.
Dallas, Texas, 1963.

694
00:50:37,162 --> 00:50:40,007
Kennedy had just put
a trade embargo on Cuba...

695
00:50:40,042 --> 00:50:42,920
ostensibly halting the shipment
of Cuban-manufactured slacks.

696
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:44,760
Incredibly popular item
at the time.

697
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,685
Lee Harvey Oswald
was not a male model.

698
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,560
You're goddamn right he wasn't.
But those two lookers...

699
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,520
who capped Kennedy from the grassy
knoll sure as shit were.

700
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,320
Well, what about you?
How do you fit in to all this?

701
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,118
This nation was swept...

702
00:50:59,198 --> 00:51:02,078
I'll get it, ma'am.

703
00:51:05,918 --> 00:51:07,758
I can't get over...

704
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:10,718
Wait a minute.

705
00:51:12,638 --> 00:51:15,481
I know that hand.

706
00:51:15,516 --> 00:51:18,396
It was in the fall 1973
Bulova watch catalog.

707
00:51:20,316 --> 00:51:23,161
You're J.P. Prewitt.

708
00:51:23,196 --> 00:51:26,076
The world's greatest hand model.

709
00:51:27,036 --> 00:51:29,879
Once upon a time.
But things change.

710
00:51:29,914 --> 00:51:32,674
Thanks to this homemade
hyperbaric chamber...

711
00:51:32,754 --> 00:51:35,634
my sweet baby never did.

712
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:38,434
Let's keep moving.

713
00:51:38,514 --> 00:51:41,394
And that's when I found out I was
in line to assassinate Jimmy Carter.

714
00:51:42,354 --> 00:51:45,234
- So, how'd you manage to escape?
- Because I'm a hand model, mama.

715
00:51:46,192 --> 00:51:49,072
A finger jockey. We don't think
the same as the face and body boys.

716
00:51:50,032 --> 00:51:52,912
- We're a different breed.
- So why male models?

717
00:51:52,947 --> 00:51:55,757
Think about it, Derek.

718
00:51:55,792 --> 00:51:58,672
Male models are genetically
constructed to become assassins...

719
00:51:58,707 --> 00:52:01,550
They're in peak
physical condition...

720
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:06,350
They can gain entry to the most
secure places in the world.

721
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:11,150
And most important of all,
models don't think for themselves.

722
00:52:11,185 --> 00:52:14,030
- They do as they're told.
- That is not true.

723
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:17,793
Yes it is, Derek.

724
00:52:17,828 --> 00:52:20,708
Yeah. Think about any photo shoot
you've ever been on.

725
00:52:22,628 --> 00:52:24,468
You're a monkey, Derek!

726
00:52:24,548 --> 00:52:27,428
Dance, monkey,
in your little spangly shoes!

727
00:52:27,463 --> 00:52:30,308
Mash your cymbals, chimpy!
Dance, Derek, dance!

728
00:52:30,343 --> 00:52:32,148
Good point.

729
00:52:32,228 --> 00:52:35,106
But if this has been going on
for so long, Mugatu...

730
00:52:35,141 --> 00:52:36,946
He's just a punk-ass errand boy...

731
00:52:37,026 --> 00:52:39,906
working for an international
syndicate of fashion designers.

732
00:52:39,941 --> 00:52:42,751
You do a little background check
on your Mr. Mugatu.

733
00:52:42,786 --> 00:52:45,666
You'll find he sold his soul to the
devil for a shot at the big time.

734
00:52:47,586 --> 00:52:50,464
But why male models?

735
00:52:53,304 --> 00:52:56,184
Are you serious? I just...
I just told you that a moment ago.

736
00:52:57,144 --> 00:52:58,024
Right.

737
00:52:58,104 --> 00:53:00,984
You're a killing machine, Derek.
They've programmed you.

738
00:53:01,944 --> 00:53:03,784
But I won't do it.
I won't kill anybody.

739
00:53:03,864 --> 00:53:06,742
It's not up to you. At the proper
moment, they'll trigger you.

740
00:53:06,777 --> 00:53:09,622
Usually using an auditory or visual
Pavlovian response mechanism.

741
00:53:10,582 --> 00:53:13,462
- "Audi-what-ey"?
- And when it's over...

742
00:53:15,382 --> 00:53:18,262
What? There's an after party?

743
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:24,020
Derek, get down!

744
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,825
You gotta get
to Maury Ballstein's computer.

745
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:30,740
He recorded everything
in case they ever turned on him.

746
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:36,378
Derek, get a grip!

747
00:53:36,458 --> 00:53:39,338
Good luck to you, Derek. I've
always been a fan of Blue Steel.

748
00:53:41,258 --> 00:53:44,138
And I hear Magnum
is gonna blow us all away.

749
00:53:45,098 --> 00:53:46,938
Come on!

750
00:53:47,018 --> 00:53:49,898
- Get out of here.
- Hang in there,J.P.

751
00:53:50,858 --> 00:53:53,736
You freakin' idiot!

752
00:53:57,576 --> 00:54:00,456
Man, that was close... I can't
believe Maury's in on it too...

753
00:54:01,416 --> 00:54:03,256
That she-male Katinka's
not messing around...

754
00:54:03,336 --> 00:54:05,176
You're telling me!
For a second there...

755
00:54:05,256 --> 00:54:07,094
I thought someone was gonna
be reading our "eugoogoly"

756
00:54:07,174 --> 00:54:10,019
Okay, all right,
we need a place to hide.

757
00:54:10,054 --> 00:54:12,814
Where's the last place anyone
would ever expect to look for you?

758
00:54:12,894 --> 00:54:13,774
I don't know.

759
00:54:13,854 --> 00:54:16,734
Think, okay?
This is important!

760
00:54:21,534 --> 00:54:24,412
I hate Hansel! Hansel, Hansel!
Everywhere I look! Hansel!

761
00:54:34,972 --> 00:54:37,852
Were you looking for a rematch?

762
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:41,690
Excuse me, Hansel. I don't think
there's an easy way to put this...

763
00:54:41,725 --> 00:54:43,530
so I am just gonna lay it out.

764
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:46,490
Derek has been brainwashed...

765
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:50,330
to kill the prime minister
of Malaysia.

766
00:54:50,365 --> 00:54:52,130
And?

767
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:55,088
And we need a place to hide until
we figure this whole thing out.

768
00:54:56,048 --> 00:54:58,928
Derek said this would be the last
place anyone would look for him.

769
00:55:01,808 --> 00:55:03,648
Yeah, you're cool to hide here.

770
00:55:03,728 --> 00:55:06,608
But first, me and him
gotta straighten some shit out.

771
00:55:08,528 --> 00:55:11,371
Fine.

772
00:55:11,406 --> 00:55:14,286
Why you been acting
so messed up towards me?

773
00:55:15,246 --> 00:55:18,126
Why you been acting
so messed up towards me?

774
00:55:22,926 --> 00:55:25,769
Well, you go first.

775
00:55:25,804 --> 00:55:27,644
I don't know. Maybe I felt
a little threatened or something...

776
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:30,604
'cause your career
is kind of just blossoming...

777
00:55:30,639 --> 00:55:33,364
and mine's kind of winding down
or whatever.

778
00:55:33,444 --> 00:55:36,324
And I felt like,
"This guy's really hurting me"...

779
00:55:37,284 --> 00:55:40,129
and it hurt.

780
00:55:40,164 --> 00:55:43,042
And I felt like when you told me
to "dere-lick" my balls...

781
00:55:43,077 --> 00:55:44,882
that really hurt.

782
00:55:44,962 --> 00:55:47,842
Maybe I was scared, man.
You're Derek Zoolander!

783
00:55:49,762 --> 00:55:51,602
Yeah, you're Derek Zoolander.

784
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:54,562
You know what it's like to be
another model in Zoolander's shadow?

785
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,200
You want to hear something crazy?

786
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,960
Your work...

787
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,920
in the winter '95
International Male catalog...

788
00:56:16,598 --> 00:56:19,478
made me want to be a model.

789
00:56:21,398 --> 00:56:24,278
I freakin' worship you, man.

790
00:56:26,198 --> 00:56:28,038
I'm sorry I was whack.

791
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:29,956
I was whack.

792
00:56:30,036 --> 00:56:32,916
I was whack.

793
00:56:40,596 --> 00:56:42,436
So welcome to chez Hansel.

794
00:56:42,516 --> 00:56:44,354
You're welcome to hide out here
as long as you want.

795
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:47,314
Well, there isn't much time.
The show's tomorrow night.

796
00:56:47,349 --> 00:56:50,194
We have to figure out
a plan by then.

797
00:56:50,229 --> 00:56:51,994
I'll round up the troops here.

798
00:56:52,074 --> 00:56:54,954
Hey, what's up, y'all?
This is Derek and Matilda.

799
00:56:55,914 --> 00:56:58,759
Derek, you know Natani and Chloe.

800
00:56:58,794 --> 00:57:01,672
We got Buzzy Sullivan,
big wave surfer from Maverick's.

801
00:57:02,632 --> 00:57:03,512
Hey, bra.

802
00:57:03,592 --> 00:57:05,432
Oh, this is this fantastic band,
the Little Kings...

803
00:57:05,512 --> 00:57:08,392
I met when I was ice sailing
in Finland.

804
00:57:08,427 --> 00:57:10,232
That's my Sherpa, Lapsang.

805
00:57:10,312 --> 00:57:13,192
Hey, everybody!
Listen up for a second.

806
00:57:14,152 --> 00:57:17,030
Derek and Matilda are hiding 'cause
some dudes brainwashed Derek...

807
00:57:17,065 --> 00:57:18,870
to off the prime minister
of Micronesia.

808
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:20,790
- Malaysia.
- Right.

809
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:23,750
So, they're gonna be hiding here.
Let's show them a good time.

810
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:27,590
- Right on!
- All right, come on, over here.

811
00:57:27,625 --> 00:57:29,430
Oh, hey, Ennui,
will you do me a favor?

812
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:31,350
Will you get me some of that tea
that me and Lapsang got...

813
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:34,308
when we were climbing
the Mayan ruins?

814
00:57:40,988 --> 00:57:43,833
This is really strong tea.

815
00:57:43,868 --> 00:57:45,708
No, it's just right.
Trust me.

816
00:57:45,788 --> 00:57:48,631
What with all the intrigue
you guys have been dealing with.

817
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:51,546
You know, Matilda, I'm surprised
you're so worried about "Der-rock"'

818
00:57:54,426 --> 00:57:56,266
From that article that I read,
it seems like...

819
00:57:56,346 --> 00:57:59,226
you don't really care too much
about guys in our line of work.

820
00:58:00,186 --> 00:58:03,064
Why do you hate models, Matilda?

821
00:58:03,099 --> 00:58:05,944
- Honestly?
- Yes.

822
00:58:06,904 --> 00:58:09,724
I think they're vain, stupid...

823
00:58:09,759 --> 00:58:12,544
and incredibly self-centered.

824
00:58:12,624 --> 00:58:15,469
I totally agree with you.

825
00:58:15,504 --> 00:58:18,384
But how do you feel
about male models?

826
00:58:18,419 --> 00:58:21,262
Sweet.

827
00:58:22,222 --> 00:58:25,102
Okay, but seriously, Matil.
Is it all right if I call you Matil?

828
00:58:27,982 --> 00:58:30,827
What's the deal, yo-yo?

829
00:58:30,862 --> 00:58:33,742
You're not telling us everything.
There's something else, isn't there?

830
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:36,540
You guys really want
to know the truth?

831
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:39,500
- Yeah.
- Then I'm gonna tell you the truth.

832
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:44,300
When I was in seventh grade...

833
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:48,140
I was the fat kid in my class.

834
00:58:51,938 --> 00:58:52,818
All right, forget it.

835
00:58:52,898 --> 00:58:55,778
- No.
- Dude, be cool tonight. Come on.

836
00:58:55,813 --> 00:58:58,658
I'm sorry.
Please, go ahead. My mistake.

837
00:58:59,618 --> 00:59:02,498
I was the one that all the pretty
girls used to make fun of.

838
00:59:02,533 --> 00:59:05,378
It was an awkward phase.

839
00:59:07,296 --> 00:59:09,136
Anyway...

840
00:59:09,216 --> 00:59:12,096
every day after school,
I would come home and...

841
00:59:13,056 --> 00:59:15,936
you know, I'd flip through the pages
of my mom's Vogue and Glamour...

842
00:59:16,896 --> 00:59:19,741
And I just...

843
00:59:19,776 --> 00:59:21,616
I'd look at these women...

844
00:59:21,694 --> 00:59:24,574
these perfect, beautiful...

845
00:59:25,534 --> 00:59:28,414
just unbelievable, skinny women.

846
00:59:28,449 --> 00:59:30,254
I just couldn't...

847
00:59:30,334 --> 00:59:33,214
Oh, I couldn't understand
why I didn't look like them.

848
00:59:36,054 --> 00:59:36,934
I just didn't get it.

849
00:59:37,014 --> 00:59:39,892
So, um...

850
00:59:40,852 --> 00:59:43,732
So I became...

851
00:59:47,572 --> 00:59:50,452
What?

852
00:59:50,487 --> 00:59:53,330
Bulimic.

853
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:58,130
You can read minds?

854
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:06,770
It's when you throw up
after every meal.

855
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:11,448
See, this is exactly
what you models do to people.

856
01:00:11,528 --> 01:00:14,408
You make them feel bad
about themselves.

857
01:00:18,248 --> 01:00:21,128
So what?
I throw up after lots of meals.

858
01:00:22,088 --> 01:00:24,966
So do I. It's a great way
to lose pounds before a show.

859
01:00:25,926 --> 01:00:28,806
Are you guys insane?
Do you understand? It's a disease.

860
01:00:29,766 --> 01:00:32,646
How'd that affect you with guys?
Did they not want to get busy?

861
01:00:33,606 --> 01:00:35,446
- Good point.
- Oh. Okay. You know what?

862
01:00:35,526 --> 01:00:38,406
I'm not gonna sit here with both
of you and discuss my sex life or...

863
01:00:42,244 --> 01:00:45,124
Or lack thereof.

864
01:00:46,084 --> 01:00:48,929
Ooh, you mean,
like, like you, like you...

865
01:00:48,964 --> 01:00:51,724
- Haven't really done it...
- You haven't done it...

866
01:00:51,804 --> 01:00:53,644
Done it in a while, yeah.

867
01:00:53,724 --> 01:00:56,602
Okay, what's a while?
Like, eight days?

868
01:00:58,522 --> 01:01:01,367
More?

869
01:01:01,402 --> 01:01:04,282
Oh, try a couple years.

870
01:01:04,317 --> 01:01:06,122
- Oh!
- Oh, snap!

871
01:01:06,202 --> 01:01:09,047
How do you live?

872
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,960
Seriously. Do you service yourself
ten times a day?

873
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,280
- End of discussion!
- Easy. Okay, hold on.

874
01:01:15,315 --> 01:01:17,640
- Easy, easy.
- I'm not comfortable talking...

875
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,560
Easy.

876
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:22,520
This has been
an emotional day for all of us.

877
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,198
I think we should get naked.

878
01:01:28,278 --> 01:01:30,118
What?

879
01:01:30,198 --> 01:01:32,958
Don't ask questions.

880
01:01:33,038 --> 01:01:35,918
Just give in to the power
of the tea.

881
01:02:16,192 --> 01:02:18,032
So I'm repelling down
Mount Vesuvius...

882
01:02:18,112 --> 01:02:20,472
when suddenly I slip
and I start to fall.

883
01:02:20,507 --> 01:02:22,832
I mean, I'm about to die.
Hot bread, Zeke.

884
01:02:22,912 --> 01:02:23,792
I mean, I'm about to die.
Hot bread, Zeke.

885
01:02:23,872 --> 01:02:26,752
Just falling...
I'll never forget the terror.

886
01:02:27,712 --> 01:02:30,555
When suddenly I remember,
"Holy shit. Hansel...

887
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:33,470
haven't you been smoking peyote
for six straight days?

888
01:02:33,505 --> 01:02:36,350
And couldn't some of this,
maybe, be in your mind??'

889
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:39,195
And?

890
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:41,070
It was. I was totally fine.

891
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:44,030
I've never even been
to Mount Vesuvius.

892
01:02:44,065 --> 01:02:45,870
Cool story, Hansel.

893
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:48,793
Thanks, Olaf.

894
01:02:48,828 --> 01:02:51,588
Dude, how dope was last night?

895
01:02:51,668 --> 01:02:53,508
I mean, the soil room.
Dirt was flying.

896
01:02:53,588 --> 01:02:56,468
You couldn't see anything.
It was like, whoa, who's that?

897
01:02:56,503 --> 01:02:59,348
- Who's this?
- I think I'm falling for Matilda.

898
01:02:59,383 --> 01:03:02,191
Dude,
I wasn't gonna say anything...

899
01:03:02,226 --> 01:03:05,106
but it was crazy energy flying
back and forth between you guys.

900
01:03:05,141 --> 01:03:06,946
It was like, whoa, look out!

901
01:03:07,026 --> 01:03:08,866
There was a moment last night...

902
01:03:08,946 --> 01:03:11,826
when she was between the two Finnish
dwarves and the Maori tribesman...

903
01:03:12,786 --> 01:03:15,631
- Oh, yeah.
- Where I thought...

904
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:18,544
"Wow, I could really spend the rest
of my life with this woman"'

905
01:03:20,464 --> 01:03:22,304
Really?

906
01:03:22,384 --> 01:03:24,224
What do you call that?

907
01:03:24,304 --> 01:03:27,184
I think you call that love, D-Bone.

908
01:03:32,904 --> 01:03:33,782
So what time is it?

909
01:03:33,862 --> 01:03:36,707
- Almost 5.00.
- What?

910
01:03:36,742 --> 01:03:39,587
Hey, guys,
that show is in three hours.

911
01:03:39,622 --> 01:03:42,502
Derek is dead unless we get
that evidence. Do you guys...

912
01:03:42,537 --> 01:03:45,382
Whoa, easy. How about a
"Good afternoon, Derek and Hansel.

913
01:03:47,302 --> 01:03:50,180
Thanks for the freak fest
last night"?

914
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:53,500
- Hello?
- Hello?

915
01:03:53,535 --> 01:03:55,860
Oh, hi, Katinka.

916
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:58,820
Uh, no, I just had a really late
party night last night.

917
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:02,660
- Derek, hang up the phone now!
- Where am I?

918
01:04:02,695 --> 01:04:05,503
- I have to go! See you at 7:00.
- Hang up!

919
01:04:05,538 --> 01:04:07,378
Derek, I thought I told you
to turn off your phone.

920
01:04:07,458 --> 01:04:10,338
Turn off my phone?

921
01:04:11,258 --> 01:04:13,098
Turn off my phone?

922
01:04:13,178 --> 01:04:15,018
- Yeah.
- Earth to Matilda.

923
01:04:15,098 --> 01:04:17,943
This phone is as much
a part of me as...

924
01:04:17,978 --> 01:04:20,856
You know what? Can we cut it out
with all the "Earth to's," please?

925
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:24,696
We're not actually saying this is
the Earth calling you, Matilda.

926
01:04:24,731 --> 01:04:27,576
Yeah. No, I got that. I understand
you don't literally mean...

927
01:04:27,611 --> 01:04:29,416
Uh, no, I don't think you do.

928
01:04:29,496 --> 01:04:32,376
Listen. It's not like we think we're
actually in a control tower...

929
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:36,216
trying to reach outer space
aliens or something, okay?

930
01:04:37,174 --> 01:04:40,054
Hello.

931
01:04:41,014 --> 01:04:43,894
- Oh, snap!
- A joke.

932
01:04:45,814 --> 01:04:48,694
Instead of doing that, I'm gonna try
to figure out a way into Maury's...

933
01:04:49,654 --> 01:04:52,532
before Derek assassinates
a world leader.

934
01:04:54,412 --> 01:04:56,252
Wait.

935
01:04:56,332 --> 01:04:59,177
I have an idea.

936
01:04:59,212 --> 01:05:02,092
They'll be looking for us
at Maury's, right?

937
01:05:02,127 --> 01:05:04,972
But they won't be
looking for not us.

938
01:05:06,892 --> 01:05:09,735
What are you talking about?

939
01:05:09,770 --> 01:05:11,610
Hansel, do you have
a cosmetics case?

940
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:14,570
Sure, I mean,
just for touch-ups or whatever.

941
01:05:14,605 --> 01:05:16,947
What are you gonna do with that?

942
01:05:16,982 --> 01:05:19,290
That'll do. Early in my career...

943
01:05:19,370 --> 01:05:22,250
I used to do my own makeup
styling and tailoring.

944
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:24,088
If I can create
a basic disguise for us...

945
01:05:24,168 --> 01:05:27,048
we may just be able to sneak
into Maury's, undetected.

946
01:05:28,008 --> 01:05:30,888
You is talkin' loco,
and I like it.

947
01:05:51,006 --> 01:05:53,886
Welcome to Derelicte...

948
01:06:00,604 --> 01:06:02,964
Hansel calling Matil.
We have entry. Repeat.

949
01:06:02,999 --> 01:06:05,324
- We have entry...
- Okay, guys. I hear you.

950
01:06:05,404 --> 01:06:08,249
Now, once you get the info, I want
you to E-mail it to my office.

951
01:06:08,284 --> 01:06:11,162
I'll download the files, and we'll
take the information to the police...

952
01:06:12,082 --> 01:06:14,962
We hear you loud and clear.

953
01:06:15,922 --> 01:06:16,802
Listen, Matil.

954
01:06:16,882 --> 01:06:19,727
I've been thinking a lot
about that bulimia thing...

955
01:06:19,762 --> 01:06:22,642
And I want you to know I understand
where you're coming from.

956
01:06:23,602 --> 01:06:26,480
I feel really bad that
good-looking people like us...

957
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:30,320
made you throw up
and feel bad about yourself.

958
01:06:30,355 --> 01:06:33,165
For serious.

959
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:36,080
- Thanks, Derek. Now, hurry up.
- Okay.

960
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,920
I got the results on the name check
you asked for on Jacobim Mugatu.

961
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,758
- Or should I say Jacob Moogberg.
- What?

962
01:06:44,718 --> 01:06:46,558
He changed his name when he went
into the fashion business.

963
01:06:46,638 --> 01:06:49,483
Apparently, the guy was the
original guitar synth player...

964
01:06:49,518 --> 01:06:51,318
for that band Frankie Goes to
Hollywood, but he got kicked out...

965
01:06:51,398 --> 01:06:54,243
before they hit it big
with that song "Relax"'

966
01:06:54,278 --> 01:06:57,158
After Frankie gave him the heave-ho,
he held a series of odd jobs until...

967
01:06:58,116 --> 01:06:59,956
get this... he invented...

968
01:07:00,036 --> 01:07:02,881
the piano key necktie in 1985.

969
01:07:02,916 --> 01:07:05,796
The guy's been
a fashion designer ever since.

970
01:07:10,596 --> 01:07:13,476
First obstacle.

971
01:07:15,394 --> 01:07:17,234
You ever use one of these?

972
01:07:17,314 --> 01:07:20,159
I don't think so.

973
01:07:20,194 --> 01:07:23,074
Watch out. Watch...
Fix that hem,Jason.

974
01:07:23,109 --> 01:07:25,451
Please. I need... Katinka!

975
01:07:25,486 --> 01:07:27,794
He's not here yet,Jacobim.

976
01:07:27,874 --> 01:07:30,752
- That little toad-face better show.
- He will show.

977
01:07:30,787 --> 01:07:33,632
Good, because I'm a hot
little potato right now.

978
01:07:35,512 --> 01:07:38,392
There must be
an "on" button somewhere.

979
01:07:38,427 --> 01:07:41,272
Did you press that apple thing?

980
01:08:25,386 --> 01:08:27,226
Wait! Hansel!

981
01:08:27,306 --> 01:08:30,186
Let's not lose our cool. Then
we're no better than the machine.

982
01:08:32,106 --> 01:08:33,944
It's almost 7:00.
I gotta go.

983
01:08:34,024 --> 01:08:36,869
No! Derek. Der, wait.

984
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:38,744
If you go, they'll make you
kill that Eurasian dude.

985
01:08:38,824 --> 01:08:41,704
I don't care, Hansel. I've never
been late for a show in my life.

986
01:08:42,664 --> 01:08:44,504
I don't plan on starting now.

987
01:08:44,584 --> 01:08:46,424
Damn it, you're right.

988
01:08:46,504 --> 01:08:49,382
Do me a favor. If anything happens
to me, give this to Matilda.

989
01:08:51,262 --> 01:08:54,142
- Oh, no.
- Please, Hansel. Take it. Please.

990
01:08:54,177 --> 01:08:57,022
- Ah, man.
- Take it.

991
01:08:58,942 --> 01:09:01,822
Let's just say I'll hold on
to it till you get back.

992
01:09:03,742 --> 01:09:05,580
Go!

993
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:07,500
We're live at the Derelicte show...

994
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:10,425
where controversial designer
Jacobim Mugatu...

995
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:13,340
has extended the olive branch to
Malaysian Prime Minister Hassan...

996
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:16,140
making him the guest of honor
at tonight's show...

997
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:19,100
And starring in that show,
veteran supermodel Derek Zoolander...

998
01:09:21,978 --> 01:09:24,858
Guys, what's happening?
Did you find the files?

999
01:09:25,818 --> 01:09:28,698
Matilda, we've got problems...
Derek's already left for the show...

1000
01:09:29,658 --> 01:09:32,418
No. No, he can't. We don't
even know what the trigger is.

1001
01:09:32,498 --> 01:09:34,338
He just went running out of here.
I couldn't stop him.

1002
01:09:34,418 --> 01:09:37,296
- I'll call him on his phone.
- He doesn't have it.

1003
01:09:37,331 --> 01:09:39,136
- What?
- Yeah, he doesn't have it.

1004
01:09:39,216 --> 01:09:41,056
What are you talking about?
He always has it.

1005
01:09:41,136 --> 01:09:44,016
- No, he gave it to me.
- Did you find the files?

1006
01:09:44,976 --> 01:09:46,816
I don't even know what they...
What do they look like?

1007
01:09:46,896 --> 01:09:47,776
They're in the computer.

1008
01:09:47,856 --> 01:09:50,701
They're in the computer?

1009
01:09:50,736 --> 01:09:53,614
Yeah, they're definitely in there...
I don't know how he labeled them...

1010
01:09:53,649 --> 01:09:55,454
- I got it.
- You gotta figure it out...

1011
01:09:55,534 --> 01:09:58,414
We're running out of time.
Find them and meet me at the show.

1012
01:09:59,374 --> 01:10:02,219
Roger.

1013
01:10:02,254 --> 01:10:04,094
In the computer.

1014
01:10:04,174 --> 01:10:07,017
It's so simple.

1015
01:10:07,052 --> 01:10:09,932
Hey, I just cut up
a couple of canta loupe halves...

1016
01:10:09,967 --> 01:10:11,732
with some cottage cheese,
if you're hungry.

1017
01:10:11,812 --> 01:10:14,692
Not the right time.
I need to figure out this trigger...

1018
01:10:14,727 --> 01:10:16,532
before Derek kills
the Malaysian prime minister.

1019
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:19,492
You just seem a little tense.
I was trying to help you relax.

1020
01:10:19,527 --> 01:10:22,372
Relax? The last thing I need
to do right now is rela...

1021
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:27,090
- That's it.
- Let's go, people!

1022
01:10:27,170 --> 01:10:30,050
Let's go! Vagrants and whores,
you're wanted in Makeup!

1023
01:10:30,085 --> 01:10:31,890
Runaways and street hustlers,
you're next!

1024
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:34,850
- You had us worried, Derek.
- Everything's cool.

1025
01:10:35,810 --> 01:10:38,688
- I'm really psyched for the show.
- Good.

1026
01:10:38,723 --> 01:10:41,568
Just remember, relax.

1027
01:10:42,528 --> 01:10:44,368
Two minutes, Derek.

1028
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:47,293
Ah, there he is.

1029
01:10:47,328 --> 01:10:50,208
I just want to wish you good luck.

1030
01:10:51,128 --> 01:10:52,968
Don't you mean "good-bye"?

1031
01:10:53,048 --> 01:10:55,926
What are you talking...

1032
01:10:58,806 --> 01:11:00,646
I know it was you, Maury.

1033
01:11:00,726 --> 01:11:02,566
I know it was you...

1034
01:11:02,646 --> 01:11:04,486
and it breaks my heart.

1035
01:11:04,566 --> 01:11:07,446
Derek, I don't know
what you're talking...

1036
01:11:09,366 --> 01:11:12,244
Derek, I'm...

1037
01:11:14,164 --> 01:11:17,044
I'm sorry.

1038
01:11:22,804 --> 01:11:25,647
Glad you could join us, Kmart.

1039
01:11:25,682 --> 01:11:27,522
Lucky for you,
there is no dress code.

1040
01:11:27,602 --> 01:11:29,442
Lucky for you,
there is no dress code.

1041
01:11:29,522 --> 01:11:31,322
I am vile spew...

1042
01:11:31,402 --> 01:11:34,282
of the wretched masses...

1043
01:11:34,317 --> 01:11:37,162
I am really, really dirty...

1044
01:11:39,082 --> 01:11:41,960
I am Derelicte!

1045
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:57,318
You make me sick
to my stomach, Jaco.

1046
01:11:59,238 --> 01:12:01,078
It'll all be over soon.

1047
01:12:01,158 --> 01:12:04,038
Derek Zoolander will be dead,
and you'll be fine.

1048
01:12:04,073 --> 01:12:05,878
You always are.

1049
01:12:05,958 --> 01:12:08,838
Come on, Derek. You're on.

1050
01:12:09,798 --> 01:12:12,676
Break a leg, Derek.

1051
01:12:43,354 --> 01:12:46,197
It's "Relax"!

1052
01:12:46,232 --> 01:12:49,112
I'm fine.
I've done this a thousand times.

1053
01:12:50,072 --> 01:12:52,952
The trigger! It's "Re"...

1054
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:05,355
Concentrate, Derelicte...

1055
01:13:05,390 --> 01:13:08,270
Do not be distracted
by the beautiful celebrities...

1056
01:13:09,230 --> 01:13:12,110
Celebrities...

1057
01:13:17,868 --> 01:13:20,748
Do what you've been trained to do,
and kill the prime minister!

1058
01:13:35,106 --> 01:13:37,986
Just do it already!

1059
01:13:45,666 --> 01:13:48,544
I got your back!

1060
01:13:48,579 --> 01:13:51,424
What?

1061
01:13:52,384 --> 01:13:53,264
It's that damn Hansel!

1062
01:13:53,344 --> 01:13:56,224
He's so hot right now!

1063
01:13:56,259 --> 01:13:59,104
Popping and locking, fool!

1064
01:14:01,024 --> 01:14:03,902
They're break-dance fighting.

1065
01:15:05,256 --> 01:15:08,134
Derek Zoolander just tried to kill
the prime minister of Malaysia.

1066
01:15:10,054 --> 01:15:12,934
That's bullshit!
Listen up, everyone.

1067
01:15:12,969 --> 01:15:14,774
Mugatu's a dick!

1068
01:15:14,854 --> 01:15:17,734
He tried to brainwash Derek
to kill the Claymation dude.

1069
01:15:19,654 --> 01:15:22,532
That's a lie! Zoolander snapped
because he's over the hill!

1070
01:15:23,492 --> 01:15:25,332
He knew his career was over,
and he couldn't face it.

1071
01:15:25,412 --> 01:15:28,292
No way. We got 30 years of files
right here in this computer!

1072
01:15:30,212 --> 01:15:32,972
They're gonna bring you down!

1073
01:15:33,052 --> 01:15:33,932
Oh, no.

1074
01:15:34,012 --> 01:15:36,892
Down!

1075
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:41,610
Where did all the files go?

1076
01:15:41,690 --> 01:15:44,535
Ha! I'm taking you out!

1077
01:15:44,570 --> 01:15:47,450
- Yo, taste my pain, bitch!
- Huh?

1078
01:15:51,290 --> 01:15:54,168
- Yes!
- Deal with that!

1079
01:15:58,008 --> 01:16:00,368
You don't have the guts, Kmart!

1080
01:16:00,403 --> 01:16:02,728
Wanna bet? And by the way...

1081
01:16:02,808 --> 01:16:04,648
you were wrong about my outfit.

1082
01:16:04,728 --> 01:16:07,608
It's the Cheryl Ladd Collection,
and I got it at J.C. Penney.

1083
01:16:08,568 --> 01:16:11,446
On sale.

1084
01:16:15,246 --> 01:16:18,126
Jig's up, Mugatu.
Everything they're saying is true.

1085
01:16:18,161 --> 01:16:20,503
I've been in on it for 30 years.

1086
01:16:20,538 --> 01:16:22,846
What are you doing, Ballstein?

1087
01:16:22,926 --> 01:16:25,804
I'm done,Jaco. I got a prostate
the size of a honeydew...

1088
01:16:25,839 --> 01:16:27,644
and a head full of bad memories.

1089
01:16:27,724 --> 01:16:29,564
It's time to set things straight.

1090
01:16:29,644 --> 01:16:32,524
You have no evidence.
Han-stupid destroyed everything.

1091
01:16:34,444 --> 01:16:37,324
I got two words for you, sugar...
Zip disk.

1092
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:40,219
The whole thing is in my den
in Long Island.

1093
01:16:40,254 --> 01:16:42,588
I can have that evidence here
in 20 minutes.

1094
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:44,922
- That a boy, Maury.
- Hold on a second.

1095
01:16:45,002 --> 01:16:47,882
I'm afraid of the radiation.

1096
01:16:49,802 --> 01:16:51,602
Sheila, honey, it's me. Listen.

1097
01:16:51,682 --> 01:16:54,562
I need you to bring that Zip disk
in the den down to the fashion show.

1098
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:00,285
I don't care
what the traffic is like.

1099
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:03,200
Take the goddamn service road
and get off before the bridge.

1100
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:07,040
So put it in one of those
Tupperware containers...

1101
01:17:07,075 --> 01:17:09,937
and I'll heat it up in
the microwave when I get home.

1102
01:17:09,972 --> 01:17:12,798
For Christ's sake, it's a casserole,
Sheila! It'll stay!

1103
01:17:14,718 --> 01:17:15,598
Shut up!

1104
01:17:15,678 --> 01:17:17,518
Enough already, Ballstein!

1105
01:17:17,598 --> 01:17:20,443
Who cares about
Derek Zoolander anyway?

1106
01:17:20,478 --> 01:17:23,358
The man has only one look,
for Christ's sake!

1107
01:17:23,393 --> 01:17:26,238
Blue Steel, Ferrari, Le Tigre?

1108
01:17:26,273 --> 01:17:29,081
They're the same face!

1109
01:17:29,116 --> 01:17:31,996
Doesn't anyone notice this?
I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!

1110
01:17:34,836 --> 01:17:37,716
I invented the piano key necktie!

1111
01:17:37,751 --> 01:17:40,561
I invented it!

1112
01:17:40,596 --> 01:17:42,436
What have you done, Derek? Nothing!

1113
01:17:42,516 --> 01:17:45,394
You've done nothing! Nothing!

1114
01:17:46,354 --> 01:17:49,234
And I will be a monkey's uncle
if I have you ruin this for me!

1115
01:17:50,194 --> 01:17:53,074
Because if you can't
get the job done, then I will!

1116
01:17:54,034 --> 01:17:56,914
Die, you wage-hiking scum!

1117
01:17:59,792 --> 01:18:01,632
One look?

1118
01:18:01,712 --> 01:18:04,592
One look? I don't think so!

1119
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:18,870
There it is!

1120
01:18:18,950 --> 01:18:20,790
Magnum!

1121
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:22,710
Holy moly.

1122
01:18:22,790 --> 01:18:25,670
Yeah, baby!
That's what I've been waiting for!

1123
01:18:25,705 --> 01:18:28,515
Dear God.

1124
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:31,428
It's beautiful.

1125
01:18:42,948 --> 01:18:45,828
Yeah!

1126
01:18:51,546 --> 01:18:53,386
That's my kid.

1127
01:18:53,466 --> 01:18:55,306
That's my son.

1128
01:18:55,386 --> 01:18:56,266
That's my son.

1129
01:18:56,346 --> 01:18:59,226
Whoa! Yeah!

1130
01:19:02,104 --> 01:19:04,984
I love that kid.
Dumb as a stump, but I love him.

1131
01:19:05,944 --> 01:19:07,784
Oh, Derek, you did it!
That was amazing!

1132
01:19:07,864 --> 01:19:10,709
I know. I turned left!

1133
01:19:10,744 --> 01:19:13,624
Yeah, that too. But you saved
the prime minister of Malaysia!

1134
01:19:14,584 --> 01:19:17,429
Oh, right. Cool.

1135
01:19:17,462 --> 01:19:20,342
Thank you, Derek Zoolander,
for saving my life.

1136
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:49,098
Hi, I'm former male supermodel
Derek Zoolander.

1137

learn to be a professional model...

1141
01:20:00,653 --> 01:20:02,458
and a professional human being.

1142

of every pair
of underwear sold.

1147
01:20:15,011 --> 01:20:16,816
What are you gonna do?

1148
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:19,776
Screw him! Hold out for more!

1149
01:20:19,811 --> 01:20:22,619
That's what I'm talking about!

we teach you
that there's more to life...

1153
01:20:29,374 --> 01:20:32,254
than just being really,
really, really good-looking.

1154
01:20:32,289 --> 01:20:34,094
- Right, kids?
- Right!

1155
01:20:34,174 --> 01:20:36,014
And cut!

1156
01:20:36,094 --> 01:20:38,972
- Looks great. I think we got it.
- All right, Mitch. Thanks.

1157
01:20:39,007 --> 01:20:41,817
- All right! That's a wrap!
- Hey, Hansel.

1158
01:20:41,852 --> 01:20:44,732
I'm gonna take these kids over
to the George Washington Bridge...

1159
01:20:44,767 --> 01:20:46,572
give them a little lesson
in base jumping.

1160
01:20:46,652 --> 01:20:49,497
- Catch you at the teacher's lounge?
- All right.

1161
01:20:49,532 --> 01:20:52,410
All right, guys. Last one to the
helicopter's a rotten egg. Let's go!

1162
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:58,095
- There's Daddy! Hi.
- Hey.

1163
01:20:58,130 --> 01:20:59,970
- How's Derek, Jr.?
- He's great.

1164
01:21:00,050 --> 01:21:01,890
Guess what.
He made his first look today.

1165
01:21:01,970 --> 01:21:04,850
- Really?
- You wanna show Daddy your look?

1166
01:21:10,608 --> 01:21:12,448
Wow.

1167
01:21:12,528 --> 01:21:15,408
- Wanna hang out for story hour?
- Great. Yeah. Let's go.

1168
01:21:15,443 --> 01:21:18,288
- Hey, who wants to hear a story?
- Yeah!
