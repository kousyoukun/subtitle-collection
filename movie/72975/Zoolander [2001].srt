1
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,200
<i>Here in Malaysia, there is an almost</i>
<i>overwhelming sense of euphoria...</i>

2
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,300
<i>as the newly-elected prime minister</i>
<i>has given this nation hope...</i>

3
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,400
<i>promising to raise</i>
<i>the substandard minimum wage...</i>

4
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,800
<i>and end child labor</i>
<i>once and for all.</i>

5
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,400
<i>Already considered a living saint...</i>

6
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,500
<i>he has become this small country's</i>
<i>greatest hope...</i>

7
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,400
<i>for a thriving future</i>
<i>in the new millennium.</i>

8
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:01,800
<i>for a thriving future</i>
<i>in the new millennium.</i>

9
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,000
Get closer, Jaco.

10
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,100
This is disgusting.
How could you let this happen?

11
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,100
I have negotiated
my butt off, Giorgio.

12
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,800
I've tried bribes, I've tried gifts.
I even sent him some pet oxen.

13
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,500
I mean, they love that crap
in Malaysia.

14
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,500
But he won't budge.

15
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,400
Listen, 50 percent of my inventory
is manufactured...

16
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,400
in sweatshops
on the Malaysian border.

17
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,400
Something has got to be done.

18
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,000
If Malaysia goes, what is next?

19
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,100
My entire panty line
is made in Vietnam.

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,700
We'll all go bankrupt
within a year.

21
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,000
The Malaysian must be
eliminated, Mugatu.

22
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,600
What? No, I don't
have time for this.

23
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,600
Perhaps you'd rather go back
to turning out novelty neckties.

24
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,200
But my new fall line is almost due.

25
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,500
And I trust you would like to live
to see your spring line as well?

26
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,000
The Malaysian prime minister
visits New York in 14 days.

27
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,100
Do it then.

28
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,700
Fourteen days? That's Fashion Week.
It's impossible! I have a show!

29
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,700
It's perfect. Invite him
to be your guest of honor.

30
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,100
That's not enough time. It takes
months to train an operative.

31
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,100
What about Fabio?

32
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,800
Too smart.
This is a rush job.

33
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,500
He's got to be extremely
dim-witted.

34
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,400
- You know the profile, Jacobim.
- A beautiful, self-absorbed...

35
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,100
simpleton who can be manipulated
and molded like Jell-O.

36
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,000
Or cookie dough.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,200
- Or Play-Doh.
- Any kind of dough.

38
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,300
The point is,
we need an empty vessel...

39
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,300
a shallow, dumb, vacuous moron.

40
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,100
And when he's finished,
we'll dispose of him.

41
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,600
But who?

42
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,900
I mean, where in all of God's
green goodness...

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,500
am I gonna find someone
that beef-headed?

44
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,000
Derek, I just have a few more
questions, if that's okay.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,100
Cool.

46
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,700
So when did you know
you wanted to be a model?

47
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,600
It would have to be the first time
I went through the second grade.

48
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,200
I caught my reflection in a spoon
while I was eating my cereal...

49
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,100
and I remember thinking, "Wow,
you're ridiculously good-looking.

50
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,200
Maybe you could do that
for a career."

51
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,500
Do what?

52
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,700
- Be professionally good-looking.
- Right.

53
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,300
What would you say your
trademark is, if you have one?

54
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,700
Well, I guess the look
I'm best known for is Blue Steel.

55
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,200
What's that look like?

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's impressive.

57
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,000
And then there's Ferrari
and Le Tigre.

58
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,100
Le Tigre's a lot softer.
It's a bit more of a catalog look.

59
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,200
- I use it for footwear sometimes.
- Can I see that?

60
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,900
Look, without Derek Zoolander, male
modeling wouldn't be what it is.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,600
He is a fashion icon.

62
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,900
So, do you spend a lot of time
working on these looks...

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,500
thinking about them?

64
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,800
Sure. I've been working on Magnum
for at least eight or nine years.

65
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,900
Magnum? That's intriguing.
Can I see that?

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,500
Are you kidding? I shouldn't
even be talking about it.

67
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,100
It's nowhere near ready.

68
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,900
<i>It's almost like</i>
<i>there's a light around him.</i>

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,100
He exudes beauty.

70
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,200
I think about Derek
every time I design a collection.

71
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:22,400
You may be familiar with the belief
that some aboriginal tribes hold.

72
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,600
It's the concept that a photo
might steal a part of your soul.

73
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,800
What are your thoughts on that...

74
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,400
as someone who gets his picture
taken for a living?

75
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,400
<i>That Blue Steel look he does...</i>
<i>Oh, my Gosh, the style and the hair.</i>

76
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,500
It's almost like the new afro for
the white man, but it's beautiful.

77
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,100
Well, I guess I would have to answer
your question with another question.

78
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,600
How many "abo-digitals"
do you see modeling?

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,800
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the</i>
<i>fashion industry's biggest night...</i>

80
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,100
<i>the VH 1 Fashion Awards.</i>

81
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,200
<i>the VH 1 Fashion Awards.</i>

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,600
<i>There he is, three-time</i>
<i>Male Model of the Year...</i>

83
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,100
<i>Derek Zoolander.</i>

84
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,500
He's like music.

85
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,300
<i>Proud owner of Blue Steel, the look</i>
<i>that made him the legend he now is.</i>

86
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,300
He's almost too good-looking.

87
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,600
Hey, Paco!

88
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:15,400
That would be my main deterrent
in considering a relationship.

89
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,900
<i>And that's who Derek Zoolander is</i>
<i>defending his title against tonight.</i>

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,500
<i>Hansel.</i>

91
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,200
- Hansel, right here!
- All right, all right.

92
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,700
<i>The rookie sensation</i>
<i>who has burned his way...</i>

93
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,900
<i>into the eye sockets</i>
<i>of the fashion world...</i>

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,200
<i>and left them clawing</i>
<i>their faces for more.</i>

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,900
Mugatu sucks!
Support the prime minister!

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,200
Mugatu uses slave labor!

97
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,800
Down with Mugatu!

98
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,900
<i>You hate to see something like that</i>
<i>at an event like this.</i>

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,900
Ugly protesters
bothering beautiful people.

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,700
<i>There's no denying Jacobim Mugatu</i>
<i>has used cheap Malaysian workers...</i>

101
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,700
<i>to make his and most</i>
<i>of the garment industry's clothes.</i>

102
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,400
Hey, Steve, how are you doing?

103
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,700
You're going for your fourth
Male Model of the Year award.

104
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,400
- Are you nervous?
- I have butterflies in my basket...

105
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,000
but I think I'm doing okay.

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,900
We also hear you're working on a new
look. Can you tell us about it?

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,900
Actually, I can't, Steve,
because it's not yet perfected.

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,900
But I can tell you
that it's called Magnum and...

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,600
Shut, baby, shut!

110
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,800
If I tell you anything else,
this guy's gonna kill me.

111
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,800
Got that right.
How are you doing, Steven?

112
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,800
- Maury Ballstein, Balls Models.
- A man who needs no introduction.

113
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,300
Maury, you've handle every important
male model for the last 30 years.

114
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,500
- Derek's chances tonight?
- Let me tell you something.

115
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,500
Nobody can touch Derek.
Nobody! I gotta get inside.

116
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,900
I'm "shvitzing" like a "shmedrik"
with all these lights.

117
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,300
Are you worried about Hansel?

118
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,900
Not as much
as I'm worried about Gretel.

119
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,100
Hey, put that Hansel and Gretel
line in your article.

120
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,900
I want people to know
how funny I can be.

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,600
Oh, believe me, they'll know.
It hits newsstands tomorrow.

122
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,800
Excuse me, Mr. Mugatu.
Mr. Mugatu, Matilda Jeffries.

123
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,100
<i>Time</i> magazine.

124
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,500
Any comment on Prime Minister
Hassan's wage increases...

125
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,800
- for Malaysian garment workers?
- No, he has no comment.

126
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,900
Let him speak for himself. Would you
like to see the prime minister...

127
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,100
out of power so you can continue
exploiting cheap Malaysian workers?

128
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,900
Hey, Mugatu! Screw you
and your little dog too!

129
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,200
Look out!
She's got an egg!

130
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,400
Oh, my God! Let go of me!

131
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,900
Yes!

132
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,400
Wow.

133
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,200
I just can't tell you how much
this means to me...

134
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,000
to be the first recipient
of this beautiful award.

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,800
We have a serious problem
on our hands, Maury.

136
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,400
This Malaysian thing
is getting out of hand.

137
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,800
I hear you, Jaco.

138
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,800
What this, the Slashie, mean...

139
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:57,100
is you consider me
the best actor slash model...

140
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,900
and not the other way around.

141
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,500
His proposed wage increase
could ruin all of us.

142
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,400
I need it taken care of soon.
I have people to answer to.

143
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,800
Now to the important stuff.

144
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,400
<i>These ain't no slashes, folks.</i>

145
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,100
<i>These are the pure breeds.</i>

<i>Young, hot, brash.</i>

148

<i>With more covers in his first year</i>
<i>than any rookie model ever...</i>

<i>and an attitude that says,</i>
<i>"Who cares? It's only fashion."</i>

150
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,000
That Hansel's so hot right now.

151
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,100
<i>I hear a lot of words</i>
<i>like "beauty" and "handsomeness"...</i>

152
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,800
<i>and "incredibly chiseled features."</i>

153
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,800
<i>To me, that's like a vanity,</i>
<i>a self-absorption...</i>

154
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,100
<i>that I try to steer clear of.</i>

155
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,200
<i>I dig the bungee. For me,</i>
<i>it's just the way I live my life.</i>

156
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,800
<i>I grip it and I rip it.</i>
<i>I live it with a lot of flair.</i>

157
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,700
<i>I live it on the edge,</i>
<i>where I gotta be.</i>

158
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,100
<i>I wasn't like every other kid,</i>
<i>who dreams about being an astronaut.</i>

159
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,000
<i>I was always more interested in what</i>
<i>bark was made out of on a tree.</i>

160
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,900
<i>Richard Gere's</i>
<i>a real hero of mine. Sting.</i>

161
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,200
<i>Sting would be another person</i>
<i>who's a hero.</i>

162
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,000
<i>The music that he's created...</i>
<i>I don't really listen to it.</i>

163
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,500
<i>But the fact that he's making it,</i>
<i>I respect that.</i>

164
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,400
<i>I care desperately about what I do.</i>

165
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,300
<i>Do I know what</i>
<i>product I'm selling? No.</i>

166
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,400
<i>Do I know what I'm doing today? No.</i>

167
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,200
<i>But I'm here,</i>
<i>and I'm gonna give it my best shot.</i>

168
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
<i>Over the past decade...</i>

169
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,700
<i>male modeling has had a shadow</i>
<i>cast over it by one man...</i>

170
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
<i>and five syllables...</i>

171
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,200
<i>Der-ek Zoo-lan-der.</i>

172
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,400
<i>Modeling, to me, isn't just</i>
<i>about being good-looking...</i>

173
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,100
<i>or having a lot of fun and</i>
<i>being really, really good-looking.</i>

174
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,600
<i>The calendar was great...</i>

175
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,400
<i>because it gave people a chance</i>
<i>to see a side of my versatility.</i>

176
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,600
<i>The original Greek word for model</i>
<i>means "misshapen ball of clay."</i>

177
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,300
<i>and I try to think about that every</i>
<i>time I get in front of a camera.</i>

178
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,100
<i>Three-time Male Model of the Year.</i>

179
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,300
And the award goes to...

180
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,800
Hansel.

181
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,800
Thank you, Lenny.

182
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,700
Wow!

183
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,900
You know, a lot of people said
winning this award...

184
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,900
four years in a row
couldn't happen.

185
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,700
Well, I guess I showed...

186
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,300
I think we've found
our solution, Ballstein.

187
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,600
No, not Derek.

188
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,300
He's perfect, and you know it.
Now make it happen.

189
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,300
I stings me like a fissure
in my ass, but you're right.

190
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,800
He's ready.

191
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,600
Who am I?

192
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,400
I don't know.

193
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,900
I guess I have
a lot of things to ponder.

194
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,100
Hey, the results are in, amigo!

195
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,200
What's left to ponder?

196
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,100
Nice comeback!

197
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,600
<i>I can't stand Hansel!</i>

198
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,400
I know, right? Riding in
on that scooter like he's so cool.

199
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,800
- And the way Hansel combs his hair.
- Or, like, doesn't.

200
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:34,200
It's like, "ex-squeeze" me, but
have you ever heard of styling gel?

201
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,500
I'm sure Hansel's heard
of styling gel. He's a male model.

202
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,500
Earth to Brint.
I was making a joke.

203
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,100
Earth to Meekus.
Duh, okay? I knew that.

204
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,300
Earth to Brint.
I'm not so sure you did...

205
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,200
'cause you were all, "I'm sure
he's heard of styling gel"...

206
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,300
like you didn't know it was a joke.

207
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,100
I knew it was a joke, Meekus.
I just didn't get it right away.

208
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,900
- Earth to Brint...
- Would you guys stop it already!

209
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,300
Did you ever think that maybe
there's more to life...

210
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:05,100
than being really, really,
ridiculously good-looking?

211
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,100
Maybe we should be doing something
more meaningful with our lives.

212
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,900
Like helping people.

213
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,900
Uh, Derek, what people?

214
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,700
I don't know.
People who need help.

215
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,300
Models help people. They make them
feel good about themselves.

216
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,300
They also show them
how to dress cool...

217
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,500
and wear their hair
in interesting ways.

218
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
I guess so.

219
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,700
You know what could really help you
sort through these important issues?

220
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,400
What?

221
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,600
Orange mocha frappuccino!

222
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,800
Yeah!

223
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,600
Come on, man! Come on!

224
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,000
"Derek Zoolander: a model, idiot."

225
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,400
- Brint!
- Huh?

226
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,800
Rufus, Brint and Meekus
were like brothers to me.

227
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,600
And when I say brother, I don't
mean like an actual brother...

228
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,000
but I mean it like the way
black people use it...

229
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,600
which is more meaningful, I think.

230
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,100
If there's anything that this
horrible tragedy can teach us...

231
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,400
it's that a male model's life
is a precious, precious commodity.

232
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,200
Just because we have chiseled abs...

233
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,400
and stunning features...

234
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:05,200
it doesn't mean that we can't die
in a freak gasoline fight accident.

235
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,200
So today, ladies and gentlemen, I'd
like to take this opportunity...

236
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,400
to announce my retire...

237
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Hansel.
He's so hot right now.

238
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,000
I would like to take this oppor...

239
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,200
People!

240
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,200
I'd like to announce my retirement
from the male modeling profession.

241
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,000
What?

242
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,600
I'm pretty sure there's a lot more
to life than being good-looking.

243
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,200
And I plan on finding out
what that is. Thank you.

244
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,600
Mr. Mugatu! Mr. Mugatu!

245
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,900
If I could just have
a moment of your time, please, sir.

246
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,500
Just one minute of your time,
please, sir!

247
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,800
- What do you want?
- I'm trying to talk to Mugatu...

248
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,100
but he's tougher to get to
than the president.

249
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,000
Oh, I thought you were gonna tell me
what a bad "eugoogolizer" I am.

250
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,300
A what?

251
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,800
A "eugoogolizer."
One who speaks at funerals.

252
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,800
Or did you think I'd be too stupid
to know what a "eugoogoly" was?

253
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,500
How could you have written
those terrible things about me?

254
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,900
Derek, my editor
put that headline on it, okay?

255
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,800
I'm sorry. I know
it came off kind of harsh.

256
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,200
Yeah, well, fortunately for you,
not too many people I know...

257
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,300
read your little <i>Time</i> magazine,
or whatever it's called.

258
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,600
Look, maybe you could do me a favor.

259
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,800
All I'm trying to do is get some
background information on Mugatu.

260
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,800
Mugatu? If you knew anything...

261
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,900
you know Mugatu's the one designer
who's never hired me.

262
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,100
Come on. There's gotta be...

263
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,600
Sorry, lady. Not interested.

264
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,800
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got
an after funeral party to attend.

265
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,200
<i>Go back home?</i>
<i>You're overreacting.</i>

266
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,500
<i>I want to do something meaningful</i>
<i>with my life, Maury.</i>

267
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,900
I have deeper thoughts on my mind.

268
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,100
The other day, I was thinking
about volunteering...

269
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,000
to help teach underprivileged
children to learn how to read.

270
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,800
Just thinking about it was the most
rewarding experience I've ever had.

271
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,000
Derek, I don't think you're cut out
for that kind of thing.

272
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,400
I mean, maybe I could even have
my own institute.

273
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:18,400
We could call it the Derek Zoolander
Center for Kids Who Can't Read Good.

274
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,700
What about us?
We built this place together.

275
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,800
Look out! Tushy squeeze!

276
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,100
When I met you,
you were a junior petite...

277
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,300
who couldn't book
a goddamn Sears catalog...

278
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,400
and who couldn't turn left
to save his ass.

279
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,500
- Now look at you.
- I can turn left!

280
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,000
Yeah, right.

281
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,500
Please. Some male models go left
at the end of a runway...

282
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,000
others go right.

283
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,100
You got a lot of gifts, but hanging
a louie just isn't one of them.

284
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,000
Sit down!

285
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,500
Hey, you want to hear
some great news?

286
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,800
Mugatu wants you
for his new campaign.

287
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,200
Didn't you hear me, Maury?
I just retired.

288
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,200
But this is Mugatu, Derek.

289
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,300
Right now, this guy is so hot...

290
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,500
he can take a crap,
wrap it in tin foil...

291
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,500
put a couple of fishhooks on it...

292
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,100
and sell it to Queen Elizabeth
as earrings.

293
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,200
Derek, you're the laughing stock
of the entire fashion world.

294
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,800
What do we do
when we fall off the horse?

295
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,900
We get back on.

296
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,100
Sorry, Maury.
I'm not a gymnast.

297
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,500
I'm going back home. I need
to get in touch with my roots.

298
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,200
Figure out who I am.
See you around, Maury.

299
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
Hey, Pop!

300
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,300
It's me.

301
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:27,000
Scrappy, Luke...

302
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,900
you remember your brother, right?

303
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,300
What do you want?

304
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,500
I thought maybe I could work
the mines with you guys.

305
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,900
All the Zoolander men together
again, like when we were kids.

306
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,500
Times have changed. You wouldn't
last one day down those coal pits.

307
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,200
Can't you even pretend
to be happy to see me, Pop?

308
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:51,900
Damn it, Derek, I'm a coal miner,
not a professional television actor.

309
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Do us all a favor
and get out of here.

310
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,200
Pop, wait, please!

311
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,700
Give me a chance.

312
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,300
I won't let you down.
I promise.

313
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,000
Hold very still. Very still.

314
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,900
I'm working right now. This...

315
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,900
- Ouch!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

316
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,200
Did my pin get in the way
of your ass?

317
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,100
Do me a favor and lose
five pounds immediately...

318
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,800
or get out of my building like now!

319
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,200
Get out!

320
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,500
I'm so tired!
No, Todd, not now!

321
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,400
It's Maury.

322
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,700
Tell me something good.

323
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,800
You may have to start
looking for someone else.

324
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,800
There is no one else.
The show is in ten days, Ballstein.

325
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,000
Jaco, I hear you,
but the kid's mixed up.

326
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,900
<i>He went home. He's talking</i>
<i>about going off to ponder...</i>

327
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,400
and tutoring underprivileged
retards or some shit.

328
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,500
I don't care what it takes.
Get him back...

329
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,900
We're running out of time.
<i>Capisce?</i>

330
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,900
Yeah, I <i>capisce.</i>
Now if I could only "ca-piss."

331
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,600
My prostate's flaring up
like a frickin' tiki torch.

332
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,300
Give me a little pee-pee.
Come on, a couple of drops.

333
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,700
That's what I'm talking about!

334
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,500
Surprise!

335
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,400
What the hell's
the matter with you?

336
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,400
<i>Pacheco back to pass.</i>

337
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,200
<i>He's feeling pressure from Pressman.</i>

338
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,300
<i>He's looking for his all-American</i>
<i>John De Rosa, the wide receiver.</i>

339
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,200
<i>He's got him wide open</i>
<i>in the middle of the field.</i>

340
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,900
<i>Big rush.</i>

341
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,800
Who's winning the match?

342
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,100
<i>Hits Kevin Conley,</i>
<i>the tight end down in there.</i>

343
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,500
State.

344
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,900
I think I'm getting
the black lung, Pop.

345
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,200
It's not very well ventilated
down there.

346
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,800
For Christ's sake, Derek,
you've been down there one day.

347
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,400
Talk to me in 30 years.

348
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:51,000
<i>Moisture is the essence</i>
<i>of wetness...</i>

349
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:59,500
<i>and wetness is the essence</i>
<i>of beauty.</i>

350
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,400
Why'd you have to come back
to this damn town?

351
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,700
I wanted to make
a new life for myself.

352
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,400
I'm sorry I was born
with this perfect bone structure.

353
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,000
That my hair looks better
done up with gel and mousse...

354
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,300
than hidden under a stupid hat
with a light on it!

355
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,500
All I ever wanted to do
was make you proud of me, Pop.

356
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,800
With what? Your male modeling?

357
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,700
Prancing around in your underwear
with your wiener hanging out?

358
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,900
You're dead to me, boy.

359
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,400
You're more dead to me
than your dead mother.

360
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,500
I just thank the Lord she didn't
live to see her son as a mermaid.

361
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,000
Mer-man.

362
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,600
Who am I?

363
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,300
<i>Hello? Derek, you hearing me?</i>

364
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,100
- God?
<i>- God?</i>

365
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,100
<i>What the shit are you talking about?</i>
<i>It's me. Maury.</i>

366
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,100
<i>I hope you're finished</i>
<i>touching your roots...</i>

367
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,600
<i>because Mugatu's making you</i>
<i>an offer you won't believe.</i>

368
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,600
<i>You gotta get your tookus back here.</i>

369
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,300
Well, to tell you the truth,
I was a little hesitant at first.

370
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:55,800
I mean, you've never hired me
before, and I've been around...

371
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,000
For ages and ages.
You've been around for a long time.

372
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,800
I never wanted anything from you.

373
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,100
And now that you're retired,
I can't have you.

374
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,300
And it's funny
how it switches like that.

375
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,300
But now the forbidden fruit
must be tasted.

376
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,600
Well, when Maury told me
what you were willing to do, I...

377
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,500
Are you not aware that I get farty
and bloated with a foamy latte?

378
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,000
My mistake, Jacobim.

379
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,600
Your mistake indeed!

380
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,700
Yes, Derek.

381
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,900
What Maury said
I was willing to do for you.

382
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,100
Let's get back to the reason
that we're really here.

383
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,800
Without much further ado,
I give you...

384
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,500
the Derek Zoolander Center
for Kids Who Can't Read Good.

385
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,600
What is this?

386
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,700
A center for ants?

387
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,900
What?

388
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,900
How can we be expected to teach
children to learn how to read...

389
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,500
if they can't even fit
inside the building?

390
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,600
- Derek, it's just a small...
- I don't want to hear your excuses!

391
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,600
The center has to be at least...

392
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,700
three times bigger than this.

393
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,200
- He's absolutely right.
- Thank you.

394
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,500
I have a vision.

395
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,400
And so do I.
Let me show you mine.

396
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,900
<i>I can't help you, lady.</i>
<i>I don't know nothing about Mugatu.</i>

397
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,500
But you've represented every
male model in each of his campaigns.

398
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,700
You must have some kind
of a relationship with him.

399
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,900
Even if I did,
why would I talk to you?

400
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,800
Shame on you how you picked on
Derek Zoolander in that story.

401
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,300
He's a sweet simpleton
who never hurt a fly.

402
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,000
Please don't change the subject,
Mr. Ballstein.

403
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:09,100
What about Mugatu's exploitation
of sweatshop workers in Malaysia?

404
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,600
- Do you have an opinion on that?
- You wanna hear an opinion?

405
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,100
With a push-up bra, you could have
a nice rack of lamb going on there.

406
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,600
Let me show you
the future of fashion.

407
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,200
Let me show you...

408
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,300
Derelicte!

409
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,500
It is a fashion, a way of life...

410
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,600
inspired by the very homeless,
the vagrants...

411
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,800
the crack whores that make
this wonderful city so unique.

412
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,900
And I want you, Derek,
to be the face...

413
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
the image... nay,
the spirit of Derelicte!

414
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,500
It'll be your glorious comeback.

415
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,200
Sounds cool.

416
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:53,000
Derek, I'd like you to meet
Katinka Ingabogovinana.

417
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,400
She'll be your day-to-day
on the campaign.

418
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,700
Let's get this model on his way!

419
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,900
<i>The big show</i>
<i>is in eight days, Derek.</i>

420
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,400
<i>Like a caterpillar</i>
<i>becomes a butterfly...</i>

421
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,100
<i>so must you become Derelicte!</i>

422
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,100
<i>So you want me</i>
<i>to sleep in the gutter?</i>

423
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,100
<i>No. We're sending you</i>
<i>to a very exclusive day spa.</i>

424
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,100
<i>So exclusive,</i>
<i>no one knows about it.</i>

425
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,500
<i>Our little secret, okay?</i>

426
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,700
- Matilda, hey.
- Hey, Arch, what's up?

427
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,700
Nothing. I've just
been up for a few days...

428
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,700
putting together these background
articles on Mugatu you asked for.

429
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,500
Very thorough, Archie.
Thank you.

430
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,500
It's weird. I couldn't get
any info on him before 1995.

431
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,500
It's like he just appeared
out of the blue.

432
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,800
- Really? That's strange.
- Yeah.

433
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,600
- Matilda Jeffries.
- Keep pulling the sweater.

434
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:52,300
- Excuse me?
<i>- Eventually the thing will unravel.</i>

435
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:57,300
You mean, if you pull the thread,
the whole thing will unravel?

436
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,800
Now you're talking, sister. If you
want to know more, go to Pier 12.

437
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,400
Things aren't what they seem.

438
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,700
What kind of spa is this?

439
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,300
It's designed
for deep, deep relaxation.

440
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,900
Come, let's get you loosened up.

441
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,900
Good boy.

442
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,800
Oh, I'm sorry.

443
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,300
Matilda, what are you doing here?

444
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,200
I was...

445
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,100
What are you doing here, Derek?
I thought you quit the business.

446
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,500
Haven't you heard? I'm the new face
of Mugatu's Derelicte campaign.

447
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,800
What do you mean, Derek?
You said Mugatu never hires you.

448
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:36,000
Well, I guess he changed his mind.
It's the world's biggest campaign.

449
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,900
What is this? Who are you?

450
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,300
This is private property. Nils!

451
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,800
I suggest you and your Kmart
Jaclyn Smith Collection outfit...

452
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,800
stay the hell away
from Derek Zoolander.

453
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,800
How do you feel, Derek?

454
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
When's the seaweed wrap?

455
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
You shut up now.

456
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I want you to relax...

457
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,900
and breathe deeply.

458
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,500
Breathe deeply.

459
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:32,000
- I like this song.
- Of course you do.

460
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,000
<i>Welcome to your relaxation time.</i>

461
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,100
<i>Let this wonderful</i>
<i>'80s classic soothe you.</i>

462
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,500
<i>Just a nice, warm, happy time.</i>

463
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,300
<i>Happy, happy.</i>

464
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,700
<i>Nothing to worry about at all.</i>

465
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,600
<i>Just relax.</i>

466
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,600
<i>Hey there, Derek.</i>
<i>My name is Lil'Kleatus.</i>

467
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:12,100
<i>I'm just a kid who wants you to know</i>
<i>the truth about child labor laws.</i>

468
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,400
<i>They're silly and outdated.</i>
<i>In the good old days...</i>

469
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,700
<i>kids as young as five</i>
<i>could work as they pleased...</i>

470
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,000
<i>from textile factories</i>
<i>to iron smelts.</i>

471
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,400
<i>Yippee! Hooray!</i>

472
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,900
<i>But today, the age-old right</i>
<i>of children to work is under attack.</i>

473
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:33,300
<i>From the Philippines to Bangladesh,</i>
<i>in China and India...</i>

474
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,400
<i>and South America too.</i>

475
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,300
<i>But you can help</i>
<i>these children, Derek...</i>

476
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,400
<i>by killing the prime minister</i>
<i>of Malaysia.</i>

477
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,400
<i>- He is bad.</i>
- What?

478
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,700
<i>You learn martial arts.</i>

479
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,900
<i>Prime minister of Malaysia bad!</i>

480
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,700
<i>Martial arts good!</i>

481
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,700
<i>Kill naughty man!</i>

482
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,800
<i>Obey my dog!</i>

483
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,600
<i>On the runway,</i>
<i>you have one objective.</i>

484
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:07,800
<i>Do not be distracted</i>
<i>by the beautiful celebrities.</i>

485
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:15,900
<i>Do as you've been trained to do and</i>
<i>kill the Malaysian prime minister!</i>

486
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,800
<i>Karate chop! Bad, man! Awful man!</i>

487
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,400
<i>In your little blue suit</i>
<i>and your spiky black hair. Kill!</i>

488
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,100
<i>And you're</i>
<i>a super-hot ninja machine!</i>

489
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,000
- Derek, are you in there?
- Hold your horses!

490
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,600
- Derek, please open the door!
- What a cuckoo dream.

491
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,800
- What?
- Hey, are you okay?

492
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,800
I've been trying to reach you
for a week.

493
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,400
A week? What,
are you having a whack attack?

494
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,600
I saw you this afternoon, dum-dum.

495
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,200
That was last Friday.

496
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,900
Earth to Matilda.
I was at a day spa.

497
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:04,300
Day. D-A-I-Y-E. Okay?

498
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,600
Look, I think I know
what this is about...

499
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,800
and I'm very complimented
but not interested.

500
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,500
- What?
- I can't sleep with you, okay?

501
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,400
- My head is killing me and...
- What are you talking about?

502
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,600
Okay, if you just want
to fool around a little bit...

503
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,100
Hey, I don't want to sleep with you!

504
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,400
I've been trying to tell you
you've been missing for a week.

505
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,500
Would you look at the date. Mugatu's
Derelicte show is tomorrow night.

506
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,800
I don't care what the date says.

507
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,400
<i>You have 1,200 messages.</i>

508
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,900
That is a bit above average.

509
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,900
- Derek, what happened in that spa?
- I don't know.

510
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,300
A little massage,
some aromatherapy.

511
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:48,100
I mean, look, lady, you can't just
come barging into people's lofts...

512
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,200
wanting sex,
then changing your mind...

513
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,700
then telling them that they've been
in a day spa for a week...

514
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,800
You have been in a day spa
for a week.

515
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,400
So what?

516
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,700
Do you understand that the world
does not revolve around you...

517
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,800
and your "do whatever it takes,
ruin as many people's lives"...

518
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,600
so long as you can make a name
for yourself as a journalist...

519
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,700
no matter how many friends
you lose...

520
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,900
or people you leave dead
and bloodied along the way...

521
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,100
just so long as you can make a name
for yourself as a journalist...

522
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,100
no matter how many friends
you lose...

523
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,000
or people you leave dead and
bloodied and dying along the way?

524
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,100
I told you I was sorry
about that article.

525
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,700
Enough! My head hurts!

526
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,700
And if it indeed is
what day you claim it is...

527
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,800
I have a pre-runway party
to attend, if you'll excuse me.

528
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,500
- By the way...
- What?

529
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,200
With your complexion...

530
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,400
you really shouldn't be wearing
your hair pulled back that tight.

531
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,800
What are you talking about?

532
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,900
It pulls back the skin
on your forehead...

533
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
creating a tension
which clogs the pores.

534
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,400
That's why you have some light
pattern dryness around your scalp.

535
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,700
Do you mind?

536
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,300
Cool.

537
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,600
I do not like snoopy reporter
with lack of fashion sense.

538
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,300
Not one little bit.

539
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,500
Hey, I just E-mailed you
all those searches...

540
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,600
on the male models who've
appeared in Mugatu campaigns.

541
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,000
It's pretty weird. It seems
like all of Mr. Mugatu's models...

542
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,500
have a bad habit of dying young
in freak accidents.

543
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,500
What?

544
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,400
- Wait a second.
- What?

545
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,600
- Oh, shit. I gotta go.
- What's going on?

546
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,500
I don't want to hang out, okay?

547
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,200
I just need to speak
with Derek Zoolander, please!

548
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,900
I just thought the way you handled
losing that award to Hansel...

549
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,200
and then you sort of laid low
for a while...

550
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,300
and then made your comeback...

551
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,700
It was so courageous.

552
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,500
Look, I gotta go pee...

553
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,700
but I'd really like to continue
talking about this conversation.

554
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,100
Yeah.

555
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,000
- Everything cool, Derek?
- It's great, Biff. Thank you.

556
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,400
Hey, Derek. You rule.

557
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,900
Thanks, Paris.
I appreciate that.

558
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:41,300
- Hey, Derek.
- Hey, Maurice.

559
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,700
- Hey, my man.
- What's happening?

560
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,300
Derek, back on top, man.

561
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,500
Thanks, Billy. You rock.

562
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,900
No, you rock. When are you gonna
drop Magnum on us, buddy?

563
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,600
Not yet. Gotta tame the beast
before you let it out of its cage.

564
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,300
- Excuse me, bra.
- You're excused.

565
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,900
And I'm not your bra.

566
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:15,000
Whatever, dude. Whatever.
Peace. God bless.

567
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:20,200
Hey, Hansel, I'm sorry you didn't
get Mugatu's Derelicte campaign.

568
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,300
Maybe next time.

569
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,600
What's that?

570
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:27,400
Mugatu's Derelicte campaign.
Sorry you didn't book it.

571
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,000
Oh, yeah?
I've never even heard of it.

572
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,900
Me and my friends have been too busy
bathing off of St. Barts...

573
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,900
with spider monkeys
for the past two weeks.

574
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,400
Tripping on acid changed
our whole perspective on shit.

575
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,200
So I guess you can "dere-lick"
my balls, <i>capitan.</i>

576
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,400
Would you hold this for me?

577
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,800
I can "dere-lick" my own balls,
thank you very much.

578
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,300
You think you're
too cool for school.

579
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,200
But I got a news flash
for you, Walter Cronkite.

580
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,000
You aren't.

581
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,000
Who are you trying
to get crazy with, <i>ese?</i>

582
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,200
Don't you know I'm loco?

583
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,200
Hey, I got a wacky idea.

584
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:28,500
What say we settle this
on the runway...

585
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,500
Han-solo?

586
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,200
Stop it.

587
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,800
Are you challenging me
to a walk-off...

588
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,500
Boo-lander?

589
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,200
Don't do this, Derek.

590
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,200
Listen to your friend Billy Zane.

591
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:57,400
He's a cool dude.
He's trying to help you out.

592
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:01,700
Oh, yeah. That's a walk-off
challenge, my friend.

593
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Ten minutes.
Old Members Only warehouse.

594
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,200
You oughta remember that.
You're a dinosaur.

595
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,800
Let's go. Open up.

596
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,900
I heard some mad stories
about this kid. He's too limber.

597
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,400
Put a cork in it, Zane!

598
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,300
It's a walk-off.

599
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,200
This is urgent, ma'am.
Do you have any...

600
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,300
Hey, Matilda.

601
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,400
What is this?
Where is everyone going?

602
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,600
Good luck, Derek!
Kick Hansel's ass!

603
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,800
Thanks, Rico. I'll try.

604
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,900
You want to see the real world
of male modeling?

605
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,100
The one they don't show you
in magazines or the E Channel?

606
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,200
Yeah, I guess. Derek, please.

607
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,500
I have something really important
to talk to you about.

608
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,700
Not now, Matilda.

609
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,400
Han-sell-out is about
to have his Han-sell-ass...

610
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,900
handed to him on a platter
with french-fried potatoes.

611
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,800
Katinka, thought you might
want to know...

612
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,000
your boy Zoolander's rolling.

613
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,700
It's a walk-off.

614
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,500
All right,
who's gonna call this sucker?

615
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,000
If nobody has any objections...

616
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:36,800
I believe I might be of service.

617
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,900
Now, this'll be a straight walk-off,
old school rules.

618
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,200
First model walks, second model
duplicates, then elaborates.

619
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,300
Okay, boys, let's go to work.

620
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,800
Age before beauty, goat cheese.

621
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,200
Whatever.

622
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,600
Right.

623
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,200
Playskool, baby.

624
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,100
You gotta cut me. I can't see.
I'm blind out there.

625
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,100
Evian.

626
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,200
It's okay.

627
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,400
- Where am I?
- It's okay.

628
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,500
- Kickin', Hoss.
- I'm going monk.

629
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:38,100
I gotta go monk. Prayer.
Pray to the Great Spirit.

630
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,300
Do it, Hansel.

631
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,300
Why is he sticking his hand
in his pants?

632
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,100
Do it, Hansel.

633
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,300
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Derek, you're not a kid anymore.

634
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,500
You could hurt yourself out there.

635
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,700
I can do this, Tyson.

636
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,700
<i>Thank God I wore underwear today.</i>

637
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,500
He's going for it.

638
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,000
Oh, my God.

639
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,100
Disqualified.

640
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,600
- Derek, come on.
- Come on.

641
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,600
- Derek, come on.
- Come on.

642
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,600
What's going on?

643
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,700
I think Katinka wants to kill you.

644
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:52,800
Good. I deserve to die if I can't
beat Han-suck-ass in a walk-off.

645
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,700
Derek, that's not true.

646
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:59,900
The guy had to pull his underwear
out of his butt just to beat you.

647
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,200
And all he had to do
was turn left.

648
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,600
What do you mean?

649
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,800
I'm not an ambi-turner.

650
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:14,200
It's a problem I had
since I was a baby.

651
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,700
I can't turn left.

652
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,700
Derek, that's nothing
to be ashamed of.

653
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:23,700
I'm sure there are a lot of people
out there who can't turn...

654
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,200
There have got to be some people
out there, just like you...

655
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:37,000
who can't turn... turn left.

656
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,700
<i>If you want answers,</i>
<i>come to Saint Adonis Cemetery now.</i>

657
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,900
- Wait! Who are you?
- Who was that?

658
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,200
I'm not sure. I have to get
to Saint Adonis Cemetery.

659
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,500
I'm gonna take you to my apartment.
You can stay there until I get back.

660
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,100
Can I come with?

661
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,100
I don't want to be alone tonight.

662
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,700
"Pedro Scialfa."

663
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,700
He died when he was 29.

664
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,000
"Vin Correjo."

665
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,300
"Derriere Extraordinaire."

666
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:31,100
Ninety-two minus sixty-three.

667
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:35,200
None of them ever made it past 30.

668
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:36,200
I did.

669
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,400
Who are you?

670
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,000
It's not important.

671
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,900
Are you a ghost?

672
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,000
He called, Derek.

673
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,500
Let's take a walk.

674
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,700
You think Zoolander's in trouble?

675
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,300
Think again.

676
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,600
What you've stumbled upon goes way
deeper than you could ever fathom.

677
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,800
The fashion industry
has been behind...

678
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,000
every major political assassination
over the last 200 years.

679
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:09,600
And behind every hit,
a card-carrying male model.

680
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,500
Okay, that's impossible.

681
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,100
Oh, yeah?
Listen and learn, sweetness.

682
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,200
Abe Lincoln wanted to abolish
slavery, right?

683
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,800
But who do you think made the
powdered wigs and leg stockings...

684
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,900
worn by our country's
early leaders?

685
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,000
Mugatu!

686
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,700
Slaves, Derek.

687
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:34,100
Without their free labor,
prices would have gone up tenfold.

688
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,100
So the powers that be
hired John Wilkes Booth...

689
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,500
<i>the original model/actor,</i>
<i>to do Mr. Lincoln in.</i>

690
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,700
I'll go on.
Dallas, Texas, 1963.

691
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,400
Kennedy had just put
a trade embargo on Cuba...

692
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:53,200
ostensibly halting the shipment
of Cuban-manufactured slacks.

693
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,000
Incredibly popular item
at the time.

694
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:57,700
Lee Harvey Oswald
was not a male model.

695
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,900
You're goddamn right he wasn't.
But those two lookers...

696
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,200
who capped Kennedy from the grassy
knoll sure as shit were.

697
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:07,400
Well, what about you?
How do you fit in to all this?

698
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,700
This nation was swept...

699
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,700
I'll get it, ma'am.

700
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,000
I can't get over...

701
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:20,900
Wait a minute.

702
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,800
I know that hand.

703
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,900
It was in the fall 1973
Bulova watch catalog.

704
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,000
You're J.P. Prewitt.

705
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:37,300
The world's greatest hand model.

706
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,200
Once upon a time.
But things change.

707
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,800
Thanks to this homemade
hyperbaric chamber...

708
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,800
my sweet baby never did.

709
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,800
Let's keep moving.

710
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:54,800
And that's when I found out I was
in line to assassinate Jimmy Carter.

711
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:58,000
- So, how'd you manage to escape?
- Because I'm a hand model, mama.

712
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:02,700
A finger jockey. We don't think
the same as the face and body boys.

713
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,100
- We're a different breed.
- So why male models?

714
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:07,600
Think about it, Derek.

715
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:12,000
<i>Male models are genetically</i>
<i>constructed to become assassins.</i>

716
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:14,400
<i>They're in peak</i>
<i>physical condition.</i>

717
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,900
They can gain entry to the most
secure places in the world.

718
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:25,200
And most important of all,
models don't think for themselves.

719
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:28,500
- They do as they're told.
- That is not true.

720
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,000
Yes it is, Derek.

721
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:35,100
Yeah. Think about any photo shoot
you've ever been on.

722
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,400
You're a monkey, Derek!

723
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,400
Dance, monkey,
in your little spangly shoes!

724
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:45,000
Mash your cymbals, chimpy!
Dance, Derek, dance!

725
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:46,600
Good point.

726
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,800
But if this has been going on
for so long, Mugatu...

727
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,700
He's just a punk-ass errand boy...

728
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,300
working for an international
syndicate of fashion designers.

729
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,100
You do a little background check
on your Mr. Mugatu.

730
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:01,500
You'll find he sold his soul to the
devil for a shot at the big time.

731
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:04,500
But why male models?

732
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:12,700
Are you serious? I just...
I just told you that a moment ago.

733
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,100
Right.

734
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:17,400
You're a killing machine, Derek.
They've programmed you.

735
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,500
But I won't do it.
I won't kill anybody.

736
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,700
It's not up to you. At the proper
moment, they'll trigger you.

737
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,900
Usually using an auditory or visual
Pavlovian response mechanism.

738
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
- "Audi-what-ey"?
- And when it's over...

739
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,000
What? There's an after party?

740
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,800
Derek, get down!

741
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,900
You gotta get
to Maury Ballstein's computer.

742
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,100
He recorded everything
in case they ever turned on him.

743
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,600
Derek, get a grip!

744
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:58,600
Good luck to you, Derek. I've
always been a fan of Blue Steel.

745
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:01,400
And I hear Magnum
is gonna blow us all away.

746
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,400
Come on!

747
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,200
- Get out of here.
- Hang in there, J.P.

748
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,700
You freakin' idiot!

749
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:19,400
<i>Man, that was close. I can't</i>
<i>believe Maury's in on it too.</i>

750
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,800
<i>That she-male Katinka's</i>
<i>not messing around.</i>

751
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,500
<i>You're telling me!</i>
<i>For a second there...</i>

752
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,100
I thought someone was gonna
be reading our "eugoogoly."

753
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:28,600
Okay, all right,
we need a place to hide.

754
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:31,400
Where's the last place anyone
would ever expect to look for you?

755
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,000
I don't know.

756
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,400
Think, okay?
This is important!

757
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:45,800
I hate Hansel! Hansel, Hansel!
Everywhere I look! Hansel!

758
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:57,500
Were you looking for a rematch?

759
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:01,700
Excuse me, Hansel. I don't think
there's an easy way to put this...

760
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,800
so I am just gonna lay it out.

761
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,500
Derek has been brainwashed...

762
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,100
to kill the prime minister
of Malaysia.

763
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:12,300
And?

764
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:16,500
And we need a place to hide until
we figure this whole thing out.

765
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:21,100
Derek said this would be the last
place anyone would look for him.

766
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:25,000
Yeah, you're cool to hide here.

767
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,500
But first, me and him
gotta straighten some shit out.

768
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,000
Fine.

769
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,500
Why you been acting
so messed up towards me?

770
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,200
Why you been acting
so messed up towards me?

771
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,300
Well, you go first.

772
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,600
I don't know. Maybe I felt
a little threatened or something...

773
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:52,700
'cause your career
is kind of just blossoming...

774
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,500
and mine's kind of winding down
or whatever.

775
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:59,600
And I felt like,
"This guy's really hurting me"...

776
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,600
and it hurt.

777
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:06,200
And I felt like when you told me
to "dere-lick" my balls...

778
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,700
that really hurt.

779
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,400
Maybe I was scared, man.
You're Derek Zoolander!

780
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,200
Yeah, you're Derek Zoolander.

781
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:19,700
You know what it's like to be
another model in Zoolander's shadow?

782
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:26,100
You want to hear something crazy?

783
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,100
Your work...

784
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:35,300
in the winter '95
International Male catalog...

785
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,800
made me want to be a model.

786
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:48,300
I freakin' worship you, man.

787
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,800
I'm sorry I was whack.

788
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,800
I was whack.

789
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,700
I was whack.

790
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,700
So welcome to chez Hansel.

791
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,700
You're welcome to hide out here
as long as you want.

792
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,300
Well, there isn't much time.
The show's tomorrow night.

793
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,800
We have to figure out
a plan by then.

794
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,100
I'll round up the troops here.

795
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:21,700
Hey, what's up, y'all?
This is Derek and Matilda.

796
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,100
Derek, you know Natani and Chloe.

797
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:28,500
We got Buzzy Sullivan,
big wave surfer from Maverick's.

798
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,600
Hey, bra.

799
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,700
Oh, this is this fantastic band,
the Little Kings...

800
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:34,500
I met when I was ice sailing
in Finland.

801
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,100
That's my Sherpa, Lapsang.

802
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,500
Hey, everybody!
Listen up for a second.

803
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,900
Derek and Matilda are hiding 'cause
some dudes brainwashed Derek...

804
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,200
to off the prime minister
of Micronesia.

805
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,100
- Malaysia.
- Right.

806
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:51,800
So, they're gonna be hiding here.
Let's show them a good time.

807
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:54,300
- Right on!
- All right, come on, over here.

808
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:57,000
Oh, hey, Ennui,
will you do me a favor?

809
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,000
Will you get me some of that tea
that me and Lapsang got...

810
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,600
when we were climbing
the Mayan ruins?

811
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,500
This is really strong tea.

812
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,900
No, it's just right.
Trust me.

813
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,200
What with all the intrigue
you guys have been dealing with.

814
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:21,500
You know, Matilda, I'm surprised
you're so worried about "Der-rock."

815
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,900
From that article that I read,
it seems like...

816
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,500
you don't really care too much
about guys in our line of work.

817
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,800
Why do you hate models, Matilda?

818
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,400
- Honestly?
- Yes.

819
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,600
I think they're vain, stupid...

820
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:41,000
and incredibly self-centered.

821
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,400
I totally agree with you.

822
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:47,700
But how do you feel
about male models?

823
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,400
Sweet.

824
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:55,800
Okay, but seriously, Matil.
Is it all right if I call you Matil?

825
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,200
What's the deal, yo-yo?

826
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:04,200
You're not telling us everything.
There's something else, isn't there?

827
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,400
You guys really want
to know the truth?

828
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:10,100
- Yeah.
- Then I'm gonna tell you the truth.

829
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:15,300
When I was in seventh grade...

830
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,400
I was the fat kid in my class.

831
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:23,900
All right, forget it.

832
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,900
- No.
- Dude, be cool tonight. Come on.

833
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,400
I'm sorry.
Please, go ahead. My mistake.

834
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,900
I was the one that all the pretty
girls used to make fun of.

835
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,300
It was an awkward phase.

836
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,600
Anyway...

837
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:44,400
every day after school,
I would come home and...

838
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:48,700
you know, I'd flip through the pages
of my mom's <i>Vogue</i> and <i>Glamour.</i>

839
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:52,000
And I just...

840
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,400
I'd look at these women...

841
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:57,800
these perfect, beautiful...

842
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:00,900
just unbelievable, skinny women.

843
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,900
I just couldn't...

844
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,800
Oh, I couldn't understand
why I didn't look like them.

845
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:09,900
I just didn't get it.

846
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,300
So, um...

847
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:16,800
So I became...

848
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:21,600
What?

849
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,600
Bulimic.

850
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,800
You can read minds?

851
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:41,300
It's when you throw up
after every meal.

852
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
See, this is exactly
what you models do to people.

853
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,900
You make them feel bad
about themselves.

854
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:56,800
So what?
I throw up after lots of meals.

855
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:00,700
So do I. It's a great way
to lose pounds before a show.

856
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:04,500
Are you guys insane?
Do you understand? It's a disease.

857
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:08,200
How'd that affect you with guys?
Did they not want to get busy?

858
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:11,000
- Good point.
- Oh. Okay. You know what?

859
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:16,100
I'm not gonna sit here with both
of you and discuss my sex life or...

860
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:20,400
Or lack thereof.

861
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:24,600
Ooh, you mean,
like, like you, like you...

862
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:27,300
- Haven't really done it...
- You haven't done it...

863
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,400
Done it in a while, yeah.

864
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:32,000
Okay, what's a while?
Like, eight days?

865
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:35,600
More?

866
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:40,500
Oh, try a couple years.

867
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:43,000
- Oh!
- Oh, snap!

868
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,800
How do you live?

869
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:49,500
Seriously. Do you service yourself
ten times a day?

870
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:52,100
- End of discussion!
- Easy. Okay, hold on.

871
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,700
- Easy, easy.
- I'm not comfortable talking...

872
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,500
Easy.

873
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,700
This has been
an emotional day for all of us.

874
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,800
I think we should get naked.

875
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:07,200
What?

876
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,200
Don't ask questions.

877
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,400
Just give in to the power
of the tea.

878
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,700
So I'm repelling down
Mount Vesuvius...

879
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:00,500
when suddenly I slip
and I start to fall.

880
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,600
I mean, I'm about to die.
Hot bread, Zeke.

881
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:07,200
Just falling...
I'll never forget the terror.

882
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:10,900
When suddenly I remember,
"Holy shit. Hansel...

883
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,700
haven't you been smoking peyote
for six straight days?

884
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,600
And couldn't some of this,
maybe, be in your mind?"

885
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:18,000
And?

886
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:21,800
It was. I was totally fine.

887
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:24,700
I've never even been
to Mount Vesuvius.

888
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,900
Cool story, Hansel.

889
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,100
Thanks, Olaf.

890
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:32,300
Dude, how dope was last night?

891
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,700
I mean, the soil room.
Dirt was flying.

892
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,300
You couldn't see anything.
It was like, whoa, who's that?

893
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:40,300
- Who's this?
- I think I'm falling for Matilda.

894
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,500
Dude,
I wasn't gonna say anything...

895
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,700
but it was crazy energy flying
back and forth between you guys.

896
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,700
It was like, whoa, look out!

897
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,700
There was a moment last night...

898
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,800
when she was between the two Finnish
dwarves and the Maori tribesman...

899
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:57,100
- Oh, yeah.
- Where I thought...

900
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:02,800
"Wow, I could really spend the rest
of my life with this woman."

901
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:04,200
Really?

902
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:06,900
What do you call that?

903
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,500
I think you call that love, D-Bone.

904
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,000
So what time is it?

905
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:19,800
- Almost 5:00.
- What?

906
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:22,500
Hey, guys,
that show is in three hours.

907
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,700
Derek is dead unless we get
that evidence. Do you guys...

908
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:30,500
Whoa, easy. How about a
"Good afternoon, Derek and Hansel.

909
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,500
Thanks for the freak fest
last night"?

910
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:37,600
- Hello?
- Hello?

911
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:39,700
Oh, hi, Katinka.

912
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:43,500
Uh, no, I just had a really late
party night last night.

913
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:46,400
- Derek, hang up the phone now!
- Where am I?

914
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:49,200
- I have to go! See you at 7:00.
- Hang up!

915
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:52,100
Derek, I thought I told you
to turn off your phone.

916
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:54,100
Turn off my phone?

917
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,400
Turn off my phone?

918
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,400
- Yeah.
- Earth to Matilda.

919
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:02,600
This phone is as much
a part of me as...

920
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:06,200
You know what? Can we cut it out
with all the "Earth to's," please?

921
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:09,200
We're not actually saying this is
the Earth calling you, Matilda.

922
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:12,200
Yeah. No, I got that. I understand
you don't literally mean...

923
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:14,600
Uh, no, I don't think you do.

924
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:18,700
Listen. It's not like we think we're
actually in a control tower...

925
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:22,200
trying to reach outer space
aliens or something, okay?

926
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:23,300
Hello.

927
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
- Oh, snap!
- A joke.

928
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:35,700
Instead of doing that, I'm gonna try
to figure out a way into Maury's...

929
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:38,900
before Derek assassinates
a world leader.

930
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:41,800
Wait.

931
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,100
I have an idea.

932
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,400
They'll be looking for us
at Maury's, right?

933
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:54,000
But they won't be
looking for not us.

934
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:55,800
What are you talking about?

935
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:59,000
Hansel, do you have
a cosmetics case?

936
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:02,000
Sure, I mean,
just for touch-ups or whatever.

937
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,600
What are you gonna do with that?

938
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:07,000
That'll do. Early in my career...

939
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:09,500
I used to do my own makeup
styling and tailoring.

940
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,700
If I can create
a basic disguise for us...

941
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,600
we may just be able to sneak
into Maury's, undetected.

942
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:19,000
You is talkin' loco,
and I like it.

943
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:42,600
<i>Welcome to Derelicte.</i>

944
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:52,600
Hansel calling Matil.
We have entry. Repeat.

945
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:54,900
<i>- We have entry.</i>
- Okay, guys. I hear you.

946
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,500
Now, once you get the info, I want
you to E-mail it to my office.

947
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:01,200
<i>I'll download the files, and we'll</i>
<i>take the information to the police.</i>

948
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,700
We hear you loud and clear.

949
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:06,400
Listen, Matil.

950
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:10,000
<i>I've been thinking a lot</i>
<i>about that bulimia thing.</i>

951
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,400
And I want you to know I understand
where you're coming from.

952
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:17,400
<i>I feel really bad that</i>
<i>good-looking people like us...</i>

953
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:20,500
made you throw up
and feel bad about yourself.

954
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,500
For serious.

955
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:27,400
- Thanks, Derek. Now, hurry up.
- Okay.

956
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:31,800
I got the results on the name check
you asked for on Jacobim Mugatu.

957
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:35,100
- Or should I say Jacob Moogberg.
- What?

958
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,400
He changed his name when he went
into the fashion business.

959
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:40,100
Apparently, the guy was the
original guitar synth player...

960
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:43,000
for that band Frankie Goes to
Hollywood, but he got kicked out...

961
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:45,200
before they hit it big
with that song "Relax."

962
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:49,500
After Frankie gave him the heave-ho,
he held a series of odd jobs until...

963
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,900
get this... he invented...

964
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,500
the piano key necktie in 1985.

965
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:57,000
The guy's been
a fashion designer ever since.

966
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,200
First obstacle.

967
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,800
You ever use one of these?

968
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:12,500
I don't think so.

969
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:15,700
Watch out. Watch...
Fix that hem, Jason.

970
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:18,700
Please. I need... Katinka!

971
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,900
He's not here yet, Jacobim.

972
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,600
- That little toad-face better show.
- He will show.

973
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:27,000
Good, because I'm a hot
little potato right now.

974
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,100
There must be
an "on" button somewhere.

975
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,700
Did you press that apple thing?

976
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:22,100
Wait! Hansel!

977
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:25,500
Let's not lose our cool. Then
we're no better than the machine.

978
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:30,000
It's almost 7:00.
I gotta go.

979
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,700
No! Derek. Der, wait.

980
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:35,100
If you go, they'll make you
kill that Eurasian dude.

981
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:38,900
I don't care, Hansel. I've never
been late for a show in my life.

982
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,300
I don't plan on starting now.

983
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,600
Damn it, you're right.

984
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:47,400
Do me a favor. If anything happens
to me, give this to Matilda.

985
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:51,000
- Oh, no.
- Please, Hansel. Take it. Please.

986
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,600
- Ah, man.
- Take it.

987
01:09:55,700 --> 01:10:00,400
Let's just say I'll hold on
to it till you get back.

988
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,900
Go!

989
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,900
<i>We're live at the Derelicte show...</i>

990
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,600
<i>where controversial designer</i>
<i>Jacobim Mugatu...</i>

991
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:11,300
<i>has extended the olive branch to</i>
<i>Malaysian Prime Minister Hassan...</i>

992
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,400
<i>making him the guest of honor</i>
<i>at tonight's show.</i>

993
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:18,300
<i>And starring in that show,</i>
<i>veteran supermodel Derek Zoolander.</i>

994
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,000
<i>Guys, what's happening?</i>
<i>Did you find the files?</i>

995
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:27,400
<i>Matilda, we've got problems.</i>
<i>Derek's already left for the show.</i>

996
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:30,200
No. No, he can't. We don't
even know what the trigger is.

997
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:32,700
He just went running out of here.
I couldn't stop him.

998
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,400
- I'll call him on his phone.
- He doesn't have it.

999
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:37,800
- What?
- Yeah, he doesn't have it.

1000
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,900
What are you talking about?
He always has it.

1001
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,400
- No, he gave it to me.
- Did you find the files?

1002
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,500
I don't even know what they...
What do they look like?

1003
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,100
They're in the computer.

1004
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,600
They're in the computer?

1005
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:52,600
<i>Yeah, they're definitely in there.</i>
<i>I don't know how he labeled them.</i>

1006
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:55,000
- I got it.
<i>- You gotta figure it out.</i>

1007
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:58,900
We're running out of time.
Find them and meet me at the show.

1008
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,400
Roger.

1009
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:04,100
In the computer.

1010
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,400
It's so simple.

1011
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:09,800
Hey, I just cut up
a couple of cantaloupe halves...

1012
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,100
with some cottage cheese,
if you're hungry.

1013
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:14,300
Not the right time.
I need to figure out this trigger...

1014
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,900
before Derek kills
the Malaysian prime minister.

1015
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,800
You just seem a little tense.
I was trying to help you relax.

1016
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:23,100
Relax? The last thing I need
to do right now is rela...

1017
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,700
- That's it.
<i>- Let's go, people!</i>

1018
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:31,100
Let's go! Vagrants and whores,
you're wanted in Makeup!

1019
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,100
Runaways and street hustlers,
you're next!

1020
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:36,200
- You had us worried, Derek.
- Everything's cool.

1021
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:39,200
- I'm really psyched for the show.
- Good.

1022
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:43,700
Just remember, relax.

1023
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,000
Two minutes, Derek.

1024
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,100
Ah, there he is.

1025
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:52,600
I just want to wish you good luck.

1026
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:55,000
Don't you mean "good-bye"?

1027
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
What are you talking...

1028
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
I know it was you, Maury.

1029
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:04,700
I know it was you...

1030
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:07,000
and it breaks my heart.

1031
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,200
Derek, I don't know
what you're talking...

1032
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,900
Derek, I'm...

1033
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:19,300
I'm sorry.

1034
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,500
Glad you could join us, Kmart.

1035
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:31,100
Lucky for you,
there is no dress code.

1036
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:34,900
<i>I am vile spew...</i>

1037
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:37,800
<i>of the wretched masses.</i>

1038
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:42,200
<i>I am really, really dirty.</i>

1039
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:44,300
<i>I am Derelicte!</i>

1040
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,500
You make me sick
to my stomach, Jaco.

1041
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:05,400
It'll all be over soon.

1042
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:08,900
Derek Zoolander will be dead,
and you'll be fine.

1043
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,400
You always are.

1044
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,000
Come on, Derek. You're on.

1045
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:16,300
Break a leg, Derek.

1046
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,600
It's "Relax"!

1047
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:55,600
I'm fine.
I've done this a thousand times.

1048
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,100
The trigger! It's "Re"...

1049
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:13,100
<i>Concentrate, Derelicte.</i>

1050
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:17,100
<i>Do not be distracted</i>
<i>by the beautiful celebrities.</i>

1051
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:18,900
<i>Celebrities.</i>

1052
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:30,600
<i>Do what you've been trained to do,</i>
<i>and kill the prime minister!</i>

1053
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:45,300
Just do it already!

1054
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:56,200
I got your back!

1055
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:58,500
What?

1056
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:02,600
It's that damn Hansel!

1057
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:04,200
He's so hot right now!

1058
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:07,500
Popping and locking, fool!

1059
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:11,900
They're break-dance fighting.

1060
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:20,700
Derek Zoolander just tried to kill
the prime minister of Malaysia.

1061
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:25,100
That's bullshit!
Listen up, everyone.

1062
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:27,400
Mugatu's a dick!

1063
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:30,700
He tried to brainwash Derek
to kill the Claymation dude.

1064
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:36,100
That's a lie! Zoolander snapped
because he's over the hill!

1065
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:38,600
He knew his career was over,
and he couldn't face it.

1066
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:43,700
No way. We got 30 years of files
right here in this computer!

1067
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:46,200
They're gonna bring you down!

1068
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:47,600
Oh, no.

1069
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:48,600
Down!

1070
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:54,800
Where did all the files go?

1071
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,900
Ha! I'm taking you out!

1072
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:01,200
- Yo, taste my pain, bitch!
- Huh?

1073
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:08,800
- Yes!
- Deal with that!

1074
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:15,700
You don't have the guts, Kmart!

1075
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,600
Wanna bet? And by the way...

1076
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:19,500
you were wrong about my outfit.

1077
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:23,000
It's the Cheryl Ladd Collection,
and I got it at J.C. Penney.

1078
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:26,000
On sale.

1079
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:34,000
Jig's up, Mugatu.
Everything they're saying is true.

1080
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:36,100
I've been in on it for 30 years.

1081
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:38,500
What are you doing, Ballstein?

1082
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:41,800
I'm done, Jaco. I got a prostate
the size of a honeydew...

1083
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:43,800
and a head full of bad memories.

1084
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:45,800
It's time to set things straight.

1085
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:50,100
You have no evidence.
Han-stupid destroyed everything.

1086
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:53,800
I got two words for you, sugar...
Zip disk.

1087
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:57,000
The whole thing is in my den
in Long Island.

1088
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:59,400
I can have that evidence here
in 20 minutes.

1089
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:01,400
- That a boy, Maury.
- Hold on a second.

1090
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:04,000
I'm afraid of the radiation.

1091
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,900
Sheila, honey, it's me. Listen.

1092
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:12,700
I need you to bring that Zip disk
in the den down to the fashion show.

1093
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:16,500
I don't care
what the traffic is like.

1094
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:20,500
Take the goddamn service road
and get off before the bridge.

1095
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,300
So put it in one of those
Tupperware containers...

1096
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,400
and I'll heat it up in
the microwave when I get home.

1097
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:32,400
For Christ's sake, it's a casserole,
Sheila! It'll stay!

1098
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:33,900
Shut up!

1099
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:35,700
Enough already, Ballstein!

1100
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:38,700
Who cares about
Derek Zoolander anyway?

1101
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,900
The man has only one look,
for Christ's sake!

1102
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,800
Blue Steel, Ferrari, Le Tigre?

1103
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:47,000
They're the same face!

1104
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,700
Doesn't anyone notice this?
I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!

1105
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:57,000
I invented the piano key necktie!

1106
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:59,200
I invented it!

1107
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:01,800
What have you done, Derek? Nothing!

1108
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:05,100
You've done nothing! Nothing!

1109
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,400
And I will be a monkey's uncle
if I have you ruin this for me!

1110
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:12,400
Because if you can't
get the job done, then I will!

1111
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:15,300
Die, you wage-hiking scum!

1112
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:20,900
One look?

1113
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,700
One look? I don't think so!

1114
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:39,500
There it is!

1115
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:40,700
Magnum!

1116
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,600
Holy moly.

1117
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:46,900
Yeah, baby!
That's what I've been waiting for!

1118
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,300
Dear God.

1119
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:51,200
It's beautiful.

1120
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:06,900
Yeah!

1121
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:15,300
That's my kid.

1122
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,900
That's my son.

1123
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:20,600
Whoa! Yeah!

1124
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:28,700
I love that kid.
Dumb as a stump, but I love him.

1125
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:30,700
Oh, Derek, you did it!
That was amazing!

1126
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:33,000
I know. I turned left!

1127
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:37,900
Yeah, that too. But you saved
the prime minister of Malaysia!

1128
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,200
Oh, right. Cool.

1129
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:43,800
Thank you, Derek Zoolander,
for saving my life.

1130
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,700

of every pair
of underwear sold.

1141
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:42,300
What are you gonna do?

1142
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:45,600
Screw him! Hold out for more!

1143
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:48,100
That's what I'm talking about!

we teach you
that there's more to life...

1147
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,200
than just being really,
really, really good-looking.

1148
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:00,200
- Right, kids?
- Right!

1149
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:01,700
And cut!

1150
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,600
- Looks great. I think we got it.
- All right, Mitch. Thanks.

1151
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:08,400
- All right! That's a wrap!
- Hey, Hansel.

1152
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:11,600
I'm gonna take these kids over
to the George Washington Bridge...

1153
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:13,600
give them a little lesson
in base jumping.

1154
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:16,500
- Catch you at the teacher's lounge?
- All right.

1155
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:19,800
All right, guys. Last one to the
helicopter's a rotten egg. Let's go!

1156
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:25,900
- There's Daddy! Hi.
- Hey.

1157
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,600
- How's Derek, Jr?
- He's great.

1158
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:30,000
Guess what.
He made his first look today.

1159
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,100
- Really?
- You wanna show Daddy your look?

1160
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:39,600
Wow.

1161
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:43,900
- Wanna hang out for story hour?
- Great. Yeah. Let's go.

1162
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,600
- Hey, who wants to hear a story?
- Yeah!
