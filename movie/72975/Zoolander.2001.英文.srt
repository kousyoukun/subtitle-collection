3
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,080
Here in Malaysia, there is an almost overwhelming sense of euphoria,

4
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,130
as the newly-elected prime minister

5
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,880
has given this impoverished nation the gift of hope,

6
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,590
promising to raise the substandard minimum wage

7
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,720
and end child labour once and for all.

8
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,850
Already considered a living saint,

9
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,350
he has become this small country's greatest hope,

10
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,310
for a thriving future in the new millennium.

11
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,190
Get closer, Jaco.

12
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,900
This is disgusting. How could you let this happen?

13
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,900
I have negotiated my butt off, Giorgio.

14
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,740
I've tried bribes, I've tried gifts. I even sent him some pet oxen.

15
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:25,370
I mean, they love that crap in Malaysia, but he won't budge.

16
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,500
Listen, 50% of my inventory

17
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,420
is manufactured in sweatshops on the Malaysian border.

18
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,250
Something has got to be done.

19
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,880
If Malaysia goes, what is next?

20
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,930
My entire panty line is made in Vietnam.

21
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,800
We'll all go bankrupt within a year.

22
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,010
The Malaysian must be eliminated, Mugatu.

23
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,520
What? No, I don't have time for this.

24
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:48,940
Perhaps you'd rather go back

25
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,730
to turning out novelty neckties in Hackensack.

26
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,070
But my new fall line is almost due.

27
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,570
And I trust you would like to live to see your spring line, as well?

28
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,200
The Malaysian prime minister visits New York in 14 days.

29
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,290
Do it then.

30
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,830
Fourteen days? That's Fashion Week. It's impossible! I have a show!

31
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,960
It's perfect. Invite him to be your guest of honour.

32
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,000
That's not enough time. It takes months to train an operative.

33
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,460
What about Fabio?

34
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,390
Too smart. This is a rush job. He's got to be extremely dim-witted.

35
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,470
-You know the profile, Jacobim. -A beautiful, self-absorbed,

36
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,850
simpleton who can be manipulated and moulded like Jell-O.

37
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,770
Or cookie dough.

38
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,360
-Or Play-Doh. -Any kind of dough.

39
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:41,240
The point is, we need an empty vessel, a shallow, dumb, vacuous moron.

40
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,990
And when he's finished, we'll dispose of him.

41
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,490
But who?

42
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,830
I mean, where in all of God's green goodness,

43
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,330
am I gonna find someone that beef-headed?

44
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,840
Derek, I just have a few more questions, if that's okay.

45
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,010
Cool.

46
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,590
So when did you know you wanted to be a model?

47
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,720
I guess it would have to be the first time I went through the second grade.

48
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,100
I caught my reflection in a spoon while I was eating my cereal,

49
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,270
and I remember thinking, "Wow, you're ridiculously good-looking.

50
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,610
-"Maybe you could do that for a career." -Do what?

51
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,610
-Be professionally good-looking. -Right.

52
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,400
What would you say your trademark is, if you have one?

53
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,820
Well, I guess the look I'm best known for is Blue Steel.

54
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,370
What's that look like?

55
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,120
That's impressive.

56
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,920
And then there's Ferrari and Le Tigre.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,250
Le Tigre's a lot softer. It's a bit more of a catalogue look.

58
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,340
-I use it for footwear sometimes. -Can I see that?

59
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,640
Look, without Derek Zoolander,

60
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,020
male modelling wouldn't be what it is today.

61
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,730
He is a fashion icon.

62
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,150
So, do you spend a lot of time working on these looks,

63
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,610
thinking about them?

64
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,990
Sure. I've been working on Magnum for at least eight or nine years.

65
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:09,080
"Magnum"? That's intriguing. Can I see that?

66
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,410
Are you kidding? I shouldn't even be talking about it.

67
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,080
It's nowhere near ready.

68
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:19,250
It's almost like there's a light around him. He exudes beauty.

69
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,380
I think about Derek every time I design a collection.

70
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,380
Derek, I don't know if you're familiar

71
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,550
with the belief that some aboriginal tribes hold.

72
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,600
It's the concept that a photo might steal a part of your soul.

73
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,810
What are your thoughts on that,

74
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,560
as someone who gets his picture taken for a living?

75
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,190
That Blue Steel look he does? Oh, my gosh! The style and the hair.

76
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,630
You know, it's almost like the new afro for the white man, 

77
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,610
but it's beautiful.

78
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:46,030
Well, I guess I would have to answer your question with another question.

79
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,950
How many "abo-digitals" do you see modelling?

80
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,790
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the fashion industry's biggest night,

81
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,040
the VH 1 Fashion Awards.

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,460
There he is, three-time Male Model of the Year,

83
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,220
Derek Zoolander.

84
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,630
He's like a muse.

85
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,090
Proud owner of Blue Steel,

86
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,300
the look that made him the legend he now is.

87
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,350
He's almost too good-looking.

88
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,600
Hey, Paco!

89
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,400
That would be my main deterrent in considering a relationship.

90
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,910
And that's who Derek Zoolander is defending his title against tonight.

91
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,790
Hansel.

92
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,250
-Hansel, right here! -All right, all right.

93
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,750
The rookie sensation who has burned his way

94
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,920
into the eye sockets of the fashion world,

95
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,250
and left them clawing their faces for more.

96
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,170
Mugatu sucks! Support the prime minister!

97
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,430
Mugatu uses slave labour!

98
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,930
Down with Mugatu !

99
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,100
You have to see something like that at an event like this.

100
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,980
Ugly protesters bothering beautiful people.

101
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,770
There's no denying Jacobim Mugatu has used cheap Malaysian workers

102
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,190
to make his, and most of the garment industry's, clothes.

103
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,490
-Derek! Derek! -Hey, Steve, how are you doing?

104
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,870
You're going for your fourth straight Male Model of the Year award tonight.

105
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,410
Come on. Are you nervous?

106
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,540
Well, there are couple of little butterflies in my basket,

107
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,120
but I think I'm doing okay.

108
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,460
We also hear you're working on a new look. Can you tell us about it?

109
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,960
Actually, I can't, Steve, because it's not yet perfected.

110
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,010
But I can tell you that it's called Magnum and...

111
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,630
Shut, baby, shut!

112
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,840
If I tell you anything else, this guy's gonna kill me.

113
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,550
Got that right. How are you doing, Steven?

114
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,800
Maury Ballstein, Balls Models. 

115
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,890
A man who needs no introduction.

116
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,390
Maury, you've handled every important male model for the last 30 years.

117
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,730
-Derek's chances tonight? -Let me tell you something.

118
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,860
Nobody can touch Derek. Nobody! I gotta get inside.

119
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,990
I'm shvitzing like a shmendrick with all these lights.

120
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,370
Derek! Derek! Are you worried about Hansel?

121
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,040
Not as much as I'm worried about Gretel.

123
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,210
Hey, put that Hansel and Gretel line in your article.

124
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,010
I want people to know how funny I can be.

125
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,800
Oh, believe me, they'll know. It hits newsstands tomorrow.

126
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,930
Excuse me, Mr. Mugatu. Mr. Mugatu, Matilda Jeffries.

127
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,220
Time magazine.

128
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,600
Any comment on Prime Minister Hassan's wage increases

129
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,980
-for Malaysian garment workers? -No, he has no comment.

130
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,440
Why don't you let him speak for himself?

131
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,110
Isn't it true you'd like to see the prime minister out of power

132
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,230
so you can continue exploiting cheap Malaysian workers?

133
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,070
Hey, Mugatu ! Screw you and your little dog, too!

134
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,360
Look out! She's got an egg !

135
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,570
Oh, my God ! Let go of me!

136
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,080
Yes!

137
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
Yes.

138
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,290
I just can't tell you how much this means to me,

139
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,880
to be the first recipient of this beautiful award.

140
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,710
We have a serious problem on our hands, Maury.

141
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,550
This Malaysian thing is getting out of hand.

142
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,970
I hear you, Jaco.

143
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,930
What this, the Slashie, mean,

144
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:59,520
is you consider me the best actor slash model,

145
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,060
and not the other way around.

146
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,650
His proposed wage increase could ruin all of us.

147
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,570
I need it taken care of soon. I have people to answer to.

148
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:12,990
All right, now to the important stuff.

149
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,530
These ain't no slashes, folks.

150
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,280
These are the pure breeds.

151
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,000
Here are the nominees for Male Model of the Year.

152
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,000
Young, hot, brash.

153
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,880
With more covers in his first year than any rookie model ever

154
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,510
and an attitude that says, "Who cares? It's only fashion."

155
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:34,220
That Hansel's so hot right now.

156
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,300
I hear a lot of words like "beauty" and "handsomeness"

157
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,010
and "incredibly chiselled features."

158
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,980
To me, that's like a vanity, a self-absorption,

159
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,230
that I try to steer clear of.

160
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:48,360
I dig the bungee. For me, it's just the way I live my life.

161
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,030
I grip it and I rip it. I live it with a lot of flair.

162
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,900
I live it on the edge, where I gotta be.

163
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,320
I wasn't like every other kid, who dreams about being an astronaut.

164
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:03,250
I was always more interested in what bark was made out of on a tree.

165
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,040
Richard Gere's a real hero of mine. Sting.

166
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,880
Sting would be another person who's a hero.

167
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,670
The music that he's created over the years,

168
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,210
I don't really listen to it,

169
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,670
but the fact that he's making it, I respect that.

170
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,220
I care desperatety about what I do.

171
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,260
Do I know what product I'm selling? No. Do I know what I'm doing today? No.

172
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,810
But I'm here, and I'm gonna give it my best shot.

173
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,360
Over the past decade,

174
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,950
male modelling has had a shadow cast over it by one man

175
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,620
and five syllables,

176
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,200
Derek Zoolander.

177
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,660
Modelling, to me, isn't just about being good-looking,

178
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,330
or having a lot of fun and being really, really good-looking.

179
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,840
The calendar was great,

180
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,680
because it gave people a chance to see a side of my versatility.

181
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,930
The original Greek word for model means "misshapen ball of clay",

182
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,390
and I try to think about that every time I get in front of a camera.

183
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,940
Three-time Male Model of the Year.

184
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,370
And the award goes to

185
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:39,800
Hansel.

186
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,770
Thank you, Lenny.

187
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:54,900
You know, a lot of people said winning this award

188
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,070
four years in a row couldn't happen.

189
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,650
Well, I guess I showed...

190
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,590
I think we've found our solution, Ballstein.

191
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,680
No, not Derek.

192
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,430
He's perfect, and you know it. Now make it happen.

193
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:29,350
It stings me like a fissure in my ass, but you're right.

194
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,850
He's ready.

195
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,120
Who am I?

196
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,460
I don't know.

197
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,130
I guess I have a lot of things to ponder.

198
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,260
Hey, the results are in, amigo!

199
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,300
What's left to ponder?

200
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,890
Nice comeback!

201
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,800
I can't stand Hansel !

202
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,180
I know, right?

203
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,550
Riding in on that scooter like he's so cool.

204
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,930
-And the way Hansel combs his hair. -Or, like, doesn't.

205
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,350
It's like, "'Ex-squeeze' me, but have you ever heard of styling gel?"

206
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,400
I'm sure Hansel's heard of styling gel. He's a male model.

207
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,650
Earth to Brint. I was making a joke.

208
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,900
Earth to Meekus. Duh, okay? I knew that.

209
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,280
Earth to Brint. I'm not so sure you did

210
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,280
'cause you were all, "Well, I'm sure he's heard of styling gel."

211
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,410
Like you didn't know it was a joke.

212
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,290
I knew it was a joke, Meekus. I just didn't get it right away.

213
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,920
-Earth to Brint... -Would you guys stop it already!

214
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,670
Did you ever think that maybe there's more to life

215
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,550
than being really, really, really, ridiculously good-looking?

216
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,100
I mean, maybe we should be doing

217
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,220
something more meaningful with our lives.

218
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,640
Like helping people.

219
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,650
Derek, what people?

220
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,860
I don't know. People who need help.

221
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,530
Models help people. They make them feel good about themselves.

222
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,070
They also show them how to dress cool, 

223
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,280
and wear their hair in interesting ways.

224
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,450
I guess so.

225
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,960
You know what could really help you sort through these important issues?

226
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,120
What?

227
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,710
-Orange mocha frappuccino! -Orange mocha frappuccino!

228
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,300
Come on, man ! Come on !

229
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,040
"Derek Zoolander. A model idiot."

230
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,520
-Brint! -Huh?

231
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,730
No!

232
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:39,240
Rufus, Brint and Meekus were like brothers to me.

233
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,660
And when I say brother, I don't mean like an actual brother,

234
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,000
but I mean it like the way black people use it,

235
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,920
which is more meaningful, I think.

236
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,260
If there's anything that this horrible tragedy can teach us,

237
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,180
it's that a male model's life is a precious, precious commodity.

238
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,680
Just because we have chiselled abs, and stunning features,

239
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,220
it doesn't mean that 

240
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,400
we too can't not die in a freak gasoline fight accident.

241
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,360
So today, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity,

242
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,320
to announce my...

243
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,250
Hansel. He's so hot right now. Hansel.

244
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,920
I would like to take this...

245
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,420
People!

246
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,430
I'd like to announce my retirement from the male modelling profession.

247
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,180
What?

248
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,900
I'm pretty sure there's a lot more to life 

249
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,480
than being really, really good-looking.

250
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,400
And I plan on finding out what that is. Thank you.

251
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,810
Mr Mugatu ! Mr Mugatu !

252
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,110
If I could just have a moment of your time, please, sir.

253
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,690
Just one minute of your time, please, sir!

254
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,780
Derek? Derek, hey!

255
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:00,880
What do you want? 

256
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,080
Actually, I'm trying to talk to Mugatu,

257
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,250
but he's tougher to get to than the president.

258
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:08,250
I thought you were gonna tell me what a bad "eugoogolizer" I am.

259
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,500
A what?

260
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,920
A "eugoogolizer." One who speaks at funerals.

261
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,840
Or did you think I'd be too stupid to know what a "eugoogoly" was?

262
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,050
How could you have written those terrible things about me?

263
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,970
Look, Derek, my editor put that headline on it, okay?

264
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,850
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I know it came off kind of harsh.

265
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,440
Yeah, well, fortunately for you, not too many people I know

266
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,400
read your little Time magazine, or whatever it's called.

267
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,610
Look, maybe you could do me a favour.

268
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,990
All I'm trying to do is get some background information on Mugatu.

269
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,030
Mugatu? If you knew anything,

270
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,990
you'd know Mugatu's the one designer who's never hired me.

271
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,370
Come on. There's gotta be...

272
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,580
Sorry, lady. Not interested.

273
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,790
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got an after funeral party to attend.

274
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,130
Go back home? You're overreacting.

275
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,550
I want to do something meaningful with my life, Maury.

276
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,970
I have deeper thoughts on my mind.

277
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:04,220
The other day, I was thinking about volunteering,

278
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,140
to help teach underprivileged children to learn how to read.

279
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:10,850
Just thinking about it was the most rewarding experience I've ever had.

280
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,940
Derek, I don't think you're cut out for that kind of thing.

281
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,440
I mean, maybe I could even have my own institute.

282
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:21,400
We could call it the Derek Zoolander Centre for Kids Who Can't Read Good.

283
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,950
What about us? We built this place together.

284
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,740
Look out! Tushy squeeze!

285
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,120
Maury!

286
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,370
Derek, when I met you, you were a junior petite

287
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,580
who couldn't book a goddamn Sears catalogue,

288
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,290
and who couldn't turn left to save his ass.

289
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,420
-Now look at you. -I can turn left!

290
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,130
Yeah, right.

291
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,840
Derek, please. Some male models go left at the end of a runway,

292
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,050
others go right.

293
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,220
You got a lot of gifts, but hanging a louie just isn't one of them.

294
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,600
Sit down !

295
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,430
Hey, you want to hear some great news?

296
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,940
Mugatu wants you for his new campaign.

297
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:01,190
Didn't you hear me, Maury? I just retired.

298
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,240
But this is Mugatu, Derek.

299
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,620
Right now, this guy is so hot,

300
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:09,200
he can take a crap, wrap it in tin foil, put a couple of fishhooks on it,

301
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,750
and sell it to Queen Elizabeth as earrings.

302
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:18,130
Derek, you're the laughing stock of the entire fashion world.

303
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,800
What do we do when we fall off the horse?

304
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,770
We get back on.

305
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:36,190
Sorry, Maury. I'm not a gymnast.

306
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,440
I'm going back home. I need to get in touch with my roots.

307
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,450
Figure out who I am. See you around, Maury.

308
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,770
Hey, Pop!

309
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,110
It's me.

310
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,570
Scrappy, Luke,

311
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,790
you remember your brother, right?

312
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,500
What do you want?

313
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:37,540
I thought maybe I could work the mines with you guys.

314
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,920
You know, all the Zoolander men together again,

315
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,590
like when we were kids.

316
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,340
Times have changed, boy.

317
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,720
You wouldn't last one day down those coal pits.

318
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,340
Can't you even pretend to be happy to see me, Pop?

319
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,520
Damn it, Derek, I'm a coal miner, 

320
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,720
not a professional film and television actor.

321
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:59,900
Do us all a favour and get out of here.

322
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,360
Pop, wait, please!

323
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,070
Give me a chance.

324
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,660
I won't let you down. I promise.

325
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:22,170
Hold very still. Very still. I'm working right now. This...

326
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,050
Oh, I'm sorry.

327
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,380
Did my pin get in the way of your ass?

328
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,550
Do me a favour and lose five pounds immediately,

329
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,760
or get out of my building like now!

330
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,260
Get out!

331
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,520
I'm so tired ! No, Todd, not now!

332
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,850
It's Maury.

333
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,770
Tell me something good.

334
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,860
You may have to start looking for someone else.

335
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:45,780
There is no one else. The show is in 10 days, Ballstein.

336
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,190
Jaco, I hear you, but the kid's mixed up.

337
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,110
He went home. He's talking about going off to ponder

338
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,620
and tutoring underprivileged retards or some shit.

339
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,660
I don't care what it takes. Get him back.

340
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:59,040
We're running out of time. Capisce?

341
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,130
Yeah, I capisce. Now if I could only ca-piss.

342
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:05,750
My prostate's flaring up like a frickin' tiki torch.

343
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:10,470
Give me a little pee-pee. Come on, a couple of drops.

344
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,640
That's what I'm talking about!

345
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,670
Surprise!

346
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,640
What the hell's the matter with you?

347
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,530
Pacheco back to pass.

348
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:14,360
He's feeling pressure from Pressman.

349
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,530
He's tooking for his All-American John DeRosa, the wide receiver.

350
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,370
He's got him wide open in the middle of the field.

351
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,040
Big rush.

352
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,960
Who's winning the match?

353
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,290
Hits Kevin Connolly, the tight end down in there.

354
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,710
State.

355
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,130
I think I'm getting the black lung, Pop.

356
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,470
lt's not very well ventilated down there.

357
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,970
For Christ's sake, Derek, you've been down there one day.

358
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,600
Talk to me in 30 years.

359
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:54,150
Moisture is the essence of wetness,

360
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:02,750
and wetness is the essence of beauty.

361
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,590
Why'd you have to come back to this damn town?

362
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,140
I wanted to make a new life for myself.

363
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,640
I'm sorry I was born with this perfect bone structure.

364
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:26,270
That my hair looks better done up with gel and mousse

365
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,980
than hidden under a stupid hat with a light on it!

366
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:33,360
All I ever wanted to do was make you proud of me, Pop.

367
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,110
With what? Your male modelling?

368
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,360
Prancing around in your underwear

369
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:40,450
with your wiener hanging out for everyone to see?

370
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,120
You're dead to me, boy.

371
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,670
You're more dead to me than your dead mother.

372
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,800
I just thank the Lord she didn't live to see her son as a mermaid.

373
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,930
Merman.

374
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,310
Merman !

375
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,910
Who am I?

376
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,050
Hello? Derek, you hearing me?

377
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,210
-God? -God?

378
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:39,260
What the shit are you talking about? It's me. Maury.

379
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,010
I hope you're finished touching your roots,

380
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,760
because Mugatu's making you an offer you won't believe.

381
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,600
You gotta get your tuches back here.

382
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:54,400
Well, to tell you the truth, I was a little hesitant at first, Mr Mugatu.

383
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:58,860
I mean, you've never hired me before, and I've been around for...

384
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,360
For ages and ages. You've been around for a long, long time.

385
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,660
I never wanted anything from you.

386
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,910
And now that you're retired, I can't have you.

387
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,290
And it's funny how it switches like that.

388
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,460
But now the forbidden fruit must be tasted.

389
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,710
Well, when Maury told me what you were willing to do, I...

390
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,380
Todd !

391
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,550
Are you not aware that I get farty and bloated with a foamy latte?

392
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,800
My mistake, Jacobim.

393
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,390
Your mistake, indeed !

394
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,860
Yes, Derek.

395
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,070
What Maury said I was willing to do for you.

396
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,490
Let's get back to the reason that we're really here.

397
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,870
Without much further ado, I give you

398
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,880
the Derek Zoolander Centre for Kids Who Can't Read Good.

399
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,640
What is this?

400
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,020
A centre for ants?

401
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,770
What?

402
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:22,860
How can we be expected to teach children to learn how to read,

403
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:25,950
if they can't even fit inside the building?

404
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:30,700
-Derek, it's just a small... -I don't want to hear your excuses!

405
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,620
The centre has to be at least

406
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,790
three times bigger than this.

407
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:44,180
-He's absolutely right. -Thank you.

408
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,470
I have a vision.

409
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:50,180
And so do I. Let me show you mine.

410
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,810
I can't help you, lady. I don't know nothing about Mugatu.

411
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,600
But you've represented every male model in each of his campaigns.

412
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,690
You must have some kind of a relationship with him.

413
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,860
Even if I did, why would I talk to you?

414
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:04,070
Shame on you how you picked on Derek Zoolander in that story.

415
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,490
He's a sweet simpleton who never hurt a fly.

416
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:09,120
Please don't change the subject, Mr Ballstein.

417
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,160
What about Mugatu's exploitation of sweatshop workers in Malaysia?

418
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,660
-Do you have an opinion on that? -You wanna hear an opinion?

419
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,750
With a push-up bra, you could have a nice rack of lamb going on there.

420
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:21,840
Let me show you the future of fashion.

421
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,010
Let me show you

422
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,050
Derelicte!

423
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,600
It is a fashion, a way of life,

424
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:35,600
inspired by the very homeless, the vagrants, the crack whores

425
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,020
that make this wonderful city so unique.

426
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:42,020
And I want you, Derek, to be the face,

427
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:46,150
the image, nay, the spirit of Derelicte!

428
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,660
It'll be your glorious comeback.

429
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,370
Sounds cool.

430
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:56,120
Derek, I'd like you to meet Katinka Ingabogovinanana.

431
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:59,290
She'll be your day-to-day on the campaign.

432
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,670
Let's get this model on his way!

433
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,630
The big show is in eight days, Derek.

434
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:12,220
Like a caterpillar becomes a butterfly, so must you become Derelicte!

435
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,270
So you want me to sleep in the gutter?

436
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:17,690
No. We're sending you to a very exclusive day spa.

437
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,440
So exclusive, no one knows about it. Our little secret, okay?

438
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,830
-Matilda, hey. -Hey, Arch, what's up?

439
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,490
Nothing. I've just been up for a few days,

440
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,500
putting together these background articles on Mugatu you asked for.

441
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,330
Wow! Very thorough, Archie. Thank you.

442
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,670
It's weird. I couldn't get any info on him before 1995.

443
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,000
It's like he just appeared out of the blue.

444
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:47,340
-Really? That's strange. -Yeah.

445
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:51,720
-Matilda Jeffries. -Keep pulling the sweater.

446
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,430
-Excuse me? -Eventually the thing will unravel.

447
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:00,230
You mean, if you pull the thread, the whole thing will unravel?

448
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,980
Now you're talking, sister. If you want to know more, go to Pier 12.

449
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,230
Things aren't what they seem.

450
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,950
What kind of spa is this?

451
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:24,130
It's designed for deep, deep relaxation. Come, let's get you loosened up.

452
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:37,390
Good boy. Good boy.

453
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,560
Good boy.

454
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:08,920
I'm sorry.

455
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,510
Derek?

456
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:15,090
Matilda, what are you doing here?

457
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,680
I was...

458
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:24,100
What are you doing here, Derek? I thought you quit the business.

459
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,690
Haven't you heard? I'm the new face of Mugatu's Derelicte campaign.

460
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:34,820
What do you mean, Derek? You said Mugatu never hires you.

461
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,570
Well, I guess he changed his mind.

462
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:39,160
It's only the biggest campaign in the world. Ever.

463
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:42,080
What is this? Who are you?

464
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:44,420
This is private property. Nils!

465
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:52,010
I suggest you and your Kmart Jaclyn Smith Collection outfit,

466
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,510
stay the hell away from Derek Zoolander.

467
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,230
How do you feel, Derek?

468
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,860
Okay.

469
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,780
When's the seaweed wrap?

470
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,900
You shut up now.

471
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:15,530
I want you to relax

472
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,620
and breathe deeply.

473
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,910
Breathe deeply.

474
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:34,800
-I like this song. -Of course you do.

475
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:39,260
Hello, Derek.

476
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,060
Hello.

477
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,020
Welcome to your relaxation time.

478
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:49,310
Let this wonderful '80s classic soothe you.

479
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,400
Just a nice, warm, happy time.

480
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:56,610
Happy, happy, happy.

481
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,450
Nothing to worry about at all.

482
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:05,040
Just relax.

483
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,710
Hey there, Derek. My name is Lit' Kteatus.

484
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,980
I'm just a kid who wants you to know 

485
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,340
the real truth about child labour laws.

486
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,470
-Okay? -Okay.

487
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:19,590
They're silly and outdated. In the good old days,

488
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,810
kids as young as five could work as they pleased,

489
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:25,850
from textile factories to iron smelts.

490
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,940
Yippee! Hooray!

491
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,060
But today, the age-old right of children to work is under attack.

492
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,320
From the Philippines to Bangladesh, in China and India,

493
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,320
and South America, too.

494
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:42,450
But you can help these children, Derek,

495
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:45,490
by killing the prime minister of Malaysia.

496
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,660
-He is bad. -What?

497
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,830
You learn martial arts.

498
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,130
Prime minister of Malaysia bad!

499
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,880
Martial arts good!

500
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:01,510
Kill naughty man! Kill naughty man! Kill naughty man!

501
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,720
Obey my dog!

502
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:06,640
On the runway, you have one objective.

503
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:11,270
Do not be distracted by the beautiful cetebrities.

504
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:19,280
Do as you've been trained to do and kill the Malaysian prime minister!

505
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:23,200
Karate chop! Bad, man! Awful man!

506
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,830
In your little blue suit and your spiky black hair. Kill!

507
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:29,540
You're a super-hot ninja machine!

508
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:42,050
-Derek, are you in there? -Hold your horses!

509
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,510
-Derek, please open the door! -What a cuckoo dream.

510
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,600
Derek!

511
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,980
-What? -Hey, are you okay?

512
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,060
I've been trying to reach you for a week.

513
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,310
A week? What, are you having a whack attack?

514
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,530
I saw you this afternoon, dum-dum.

515
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,360
That was last Friday.

516
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,360
Earth to Matilda. I was at a day spa.

517
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:07,410
Day. D-A-I-Y-E. Okay?

518
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,120
Look, I think I know what this is about,

519
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:14,330
and I'm very complimented, but not interested.

520
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,750
-What? -I can't sleep with you, okay?

521
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,550
-My head is killing me and... -What are you talking about?

522
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,590
Okay, if you just want to fool around a little bit...

523
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,260
Hey, I don't want to sleep with you !

524
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,510
I've been trying to tell you you've been missing for a week.

525
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,640
Would you look at the date.

526
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,730
Mugatu's Derelicte show is tomorrow night.

527
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:33,980
I don't care what the date says.

528
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,610
You have 1,200 messages.

529
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,820
That is a bit above average.

530
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,110
-Derek, what happened in that spa? -I don't know.

531
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,490
A little massage, some aromatherapy.

532
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:51,330
I mean, look, lady, you can't just come barging into people's lofts,

533
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:53,410
wanting sex, then changing your mind,

534
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,880
then telling them that they've been in a day spa for a week.

535
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,000
You have been in a day spa for a week.

536
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,630
So what?

537
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:02,880
Do you understand that the world does not revolve around you,

538
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,970
and your "do whatever it takes, ruin as many people's lives,

539
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,890
"so long as you can make a name for yourself as a investigatory journalist,

540
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,430
"no matter how many friends you lose,

541
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,180
"or people you leave dead and bloodied along the way,

542
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,060
"just so long as you can make a name for yourself

543
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,310
"as an investigatory journalist,

544
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,360
"no matter how many friends you lose,

545
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,150
"or people you leave dead and bloodied and dying along the way"?

546
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:26,320
Derek, I told you I was sorry about that article.

547
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:28,910
Enough! My head hurts!

548
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,660
And if it indeed is what day you claim it is,

549
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,700
I have a pre-runway party to attend, if you'll excuse me.

550
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:39,500
-By the way... -What?

551
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,000
With your complexion,

552
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:43,170
you really shouldn't be wearing your hair pulled back that tight.

553
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,090
What are you talking about?

554
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,880
It pulls back the skin on your forehead,

555
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,930
creating a tension which clogs the pores.

556
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:51,640
That's why you have some light pattern dryness around your scalp.

557
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,020
Do you mind?

558
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,440
Cool.

559
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:20,790
l do not like snoopy reporter with lack of fashion sense.

560
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,380
Not one little bit.

561
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,680
Hey, l just e-mailed you all those LexisNexis searches,

562
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,810
on the male models who've appeared in Mugatu campaigns.

563
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:36,270
It's pretty weird. It seems like all of Mr Mugatu's models

564
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:39,650
have a bad habit of dying young in freak accidents.

565
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:40,770
What?

566
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:50,490
-Wait a second. -What?

567
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,590
-Oh, shit. I gotta go. -What's going on?

568
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,800
I don't want to hang out, okay?

569
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,390
I just need to speak with Derek Zoolander, please!

570
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:14,720
I just thought the way you handled losing that award to Hansel,

571
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,520
and then you sort of laid low for a while,

572
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,640
and then made your comeback...

573
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:21,560
It was so courageous.

574
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,810
Look, I gotta go pee,

575
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,650
but I'd really like to continue talking about this conversation

576
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,860
when I come back.

577
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:34,320
-Everything cool, Derek? -It's great, Biff. Thank you.

578
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:38,500
Hey, Derek. You rule.

579
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,960
Thanks, Paris. I appreciate that.

580
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:44,210
-Hey, Derek. -Hey, Maurice.

581
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,090
-Hey, my man. -What's happening?

582
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,260
Derek, back on top, man.

583
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,430
Thanks, Billy. You rock.

584
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,140
No, you rock. When are you gonna drop Magnum on us, buddy?

585
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:58,720
Not yet. Gotta tame the beast before you let it out of its cage.

586
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,690
-Excuse me, bro. -You're excused.

587
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,780
And l'm not your bro.

588
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:18,160
Whatever, dude. Whatever. Peace. God bless.

589
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,540
Hey, Hansel, I'm sorry you didn't get Mugatu's Derelicte campaign.

590
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,420
Maybe next time.

591
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,790
What's that?

592
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:30,340
Mugatu's Derelicte campaign. Sorry you didn't book it.

593
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,090
Oh, yeah? I've never even heard of it.

594
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,640
Me and my friends have been too busy

595
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,300
bathing off the southern coast of St Barts,

596
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:38,060
with spider monkeys for the past two weeks.

597
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:41,230
Tripping on acid changed our whole perspective on shit.

598
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,400
So l guess you can Dere-lick my balls, captain.

599
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,360
Would you hold this for me?

600
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,910
I can Dere-lick my own balls, thank you very much.

601
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,450
You think you're too cool for school.

602
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:06,250
But I got a news flash for you, Walter Cronkite.

603
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,050
You aren't.

604
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:19,050
Who are you trying to get crazy with, ese?

605
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,560
Don't you know I'm loco?

606
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:26,400
Hey, I got a wacky idea.

607
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,570
What say we settle this on the runway?

608
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:35,150
Han-solo?

609
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,080
Stop it.

610
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,000
Are you challenging me to a walk-off

611
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,250
Boo-lander?

612
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,380
Don't do this, Derek.

613
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,300
Listen to your friend Billy Zane.

614
00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:00,470
He's a cool dude. He's trying to help you out.

615
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:04,600
Oh, yeah. That's a walk-off challenge, my friend.

616
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:12,150
Ten minutes. Old Members Only warehouse.

617
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,360
You oughta remember that. You're a dinosaur.

618
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:16,110
Let's go. Open up.

619
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:23,450
I heard some mad stories about this kid. He's limber. He's too limber.

620
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,620
Put a cork in it, Zane!

621
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,630
It's a walk-off. Walk-off.

622
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,800
This is urgent, ma'am. Do you have any...

623
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:38,470
Derek? Derek! Derek!

624
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,590
Hey, Matilda.

625
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,760
What is this? Where is everyone going?

626
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,100
Good luck, Derek! Kick Hansel's ass!

627
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,810
Thanks, Rico. I'll try.

628
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:48,270
You want to see the real world of male modelling?

629
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:51,100
The one they don't show you in magazines or the E! channel?

630
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:53,610
Yeah, I guess. Derek, please.

631
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:55,780
I have something really important to talk to you about.

632
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,070
Not now, Matilda.

633
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:59,910
Han-sell-out is about to have his Han-sell-ass

634
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:03,410
handed to him on a platter with french-fried potatoes.

635
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:06,160
Katinka, thought you might want to know,

636
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,410
your boy Zoolander's rolling.

637
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,000
It's a walk-off.

638
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,980
All right, who's gonna call this sucker?

639
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,570
If nobody has any objections,

640
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,030
I believe I might be of service.

641
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,370
Now, this'll be a straight walk-off, old school rules.

642
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,380
First model walks, second model duplicates,

643
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,750
then elaborates.

644
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,750
Okay, boys, let's go to work.

645
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:00,300
Age before beauty, goat cheese.

646
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,760
Whatever.

647
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,180
Right.

648
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:37,750
Playschool, baby.

649
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:10,540
You got to cut me. I can't see. I'm blind out there.

650
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:11,620
Evian. Evian.

651
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,710
It's okay. It's okay.

652
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:31,970
-Where am I? Where am I? -It's okay.

653
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:35,890
-Kickin', Hoss. -I'm going monk.

654
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:40,440
I got to go monk. Prayer. Prayer.

655
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:41,730
Pray to the Great Spirit.

656
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,670
Do it, Hansel. Just do it. Do it, Hansel.

657
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:05,510
Why is he sticking his hand in his pants?

658
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,680
Do it, Hansel.

659
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,280
That's what I'm talking about.

660
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:34,740
Derek, you're not a kid any more. You could hurt yourself out there.

661
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:39,040
I can do this, Tyson.

662
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,050
Thank God I wore underwear today.

663
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,150
He's going for it.

664
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:25,250
Oh, my God.

665
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,600
Disqualified.

666
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:45,190
Derek, come on. Come on.

667
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:46,980
Come on.

668
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,030
What's going on?

669
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:51,200
I think Katinka wants to kill you.

670
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,950
Good. I deserve to die if I can't beat Han-suck-ass in a walk-off.

671
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,200
Derek, that's not true.

672
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:01,620
The guy had to miraculously pull his underwear out of his butt

673
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:02,960
just to beat you.

674
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,840
And all he had to do was turn left.

675
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,880
What do you mean?

676
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:14,010
I'm not an ambi-turner.

677
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:17,680
It's a problem I had since I was a baby.

678
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,060
I can't turn left.

679
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:23,980
Derek, that's nothing to be ashamed of.

680
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:27,270
I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who can't turn...

681
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:33,910
I mean, there have got to be some people out there,

682
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:36,660
just like you, who can't turn...

683
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,830
Turn left.

684
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:42,910
Hello.

685
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,750
If you want answers, come to Saint Adonis Cemetery now.

686
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,790
Wait! Wait! Wait! Who are you?

687
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,500
Who was that?

688
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:52,760
I'm not sure. I have to get to Saint Adonis Cemetery.

689
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,260
Listen, I'm gonna take you to my apartment, okay?

690
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,090
You can stay there until I get back.

691
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,850
Can I come with?

692
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:00,770
I don't want to be alone tonight.

693
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:14,700
Pedro Scialfa.

694
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,280
He died when he was 29.

695
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,200
Vin Correjo.

696
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,880
"Derriere Extraordinaire."

697
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,670
92 minus 63.

698
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,390
None of them ever made it past 30.

699
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:39,850
I did.

700
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:42,520
Who are you?

701
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:45,190
It's not important.

702
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:47,100
Are you a ghost?

703
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,230
He called, Derek.

704
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:53,570
Let's take a walk.

705
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:58,110
You think Zoolander's in trouble? Think again.

706
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:01,580
What you've stumbled upon goes way deeper than you could ever fathom.

707
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,160
The fashion industry has been behind,

708
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:08,420
every major political assassination over the last 200 years.

709
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:12,960
And behind every hit, a card-carrying male model.

710
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:14,840
Okay, that's impossible.

711
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,760
Oh, yeah? Listen and learn, sweetness.

712
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:20,680
Abe Lincoln wanted to abolish slavery, right?

713
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,180
But who do you think made the powdered wigs

714
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:25,350
and coloured leg stockings, worn by our country's early leaders?

715
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,440
Mugatu!

716
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,900
Slaves, Derek.

717
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:37,490
Without their free labour, prices on such items would have gone up tenfold.

718
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:40,530
So the powers that be hired John Wilkes Booth,

719
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,950
the originat model/actor, to do Mr Lincoln in.

720
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:47,120
I'll go on.

721
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:50,250
Dallas, Texas, 1963.

722
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,880
Kennedy had just put a trade embargo on Cuba,

723
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,670
ostensibly halting the shipment of Cuban-manufactured slacks.

724
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,470
Incredibly popular item at the time.

725
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,010
Lee Harvey Oswald was not a male model.

726
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,140
You're God damn right he wasn't.

727
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:03,760
But those two lookers who capped Kennedy

728
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:05,720
from the grassy knoll sure as shit were.

729
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,770
Well, what about you?

730
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:10,440
How do you fit in to all this?

731
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:12,310
This nation was swept...

732
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:14,650
I'll get it, ma'am.

733
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,490
I can't get over...

734
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:23,990
Wait a minute.

735
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:28,000
-No. -I know that hand.

736
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:33,210
It was in the fall 1973 Bulova watch catalogue.

737
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:36,460
You're J. P. Prewitt.

738
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:40,260
The world's greatest hand model.

739
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:45,720
Once upon a time. But things change.

740
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:48,270
Thanks to this homemade hyperbaric chamber,

741
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:50,100
my sweet baby never did.

742
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:54,020
Let's keep moving.

743
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:58,320
And that's when I found out I was in line to assassinate Jimmy Carter.

744
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,530
-So, how did you manage to escape? -Because I'm a hand model, mama.

745
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,120
A finger jockey. We don't think the same way

746
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,280
as the face and body boys do.

747
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:09,620
-We're a different breed. -So why male models?

748
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,120
Think about it, Derek.

749
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:15,210
Male models are genetically constructed to become assassins.

750
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:17,250
They're in peak physical condition.

751
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:23,050
They can gain entry to the most secure places in the world.

752
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:28,770
And most important of all, models don't think for themselves.

753
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:32,060
-They do as they're told. -That is not true.

754
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:34,230
-Yes, it is, Derek. -Okay.

755
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:38,400
Yeah. Think about any photo shoot you've ever been on.

756
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:41,950
You're a monkey, Derek! You're a monkey.

757
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:44,950
Dance, monkey, in your little spangly shoes!

758
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:47,620
Mash your cymbals, chimpy! Dance, Derek, dance!

759
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,160
Good point.

760
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,000
But if this has been going on for so long, Mugatu...

761
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,960
He's just a punk-ass errand boy,

762
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,540
working for an international syndicate of fashion designers.

763
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,760
You do a little background check on your Mr Mugatu.

764
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:04,930
You'll find that he sold his soul to the devil for a shot at the big time.

765
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:07,470
But why male models?

766
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:15,980
Are you serious? I just... l just told you that a moment ago.

767
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:17,690
Right.

768
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:21,150
You're a killing machine, Derek. They've programmed you.

769
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,070
But I won't do it. I won't kill anybody.

770
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:24,360
It's not up to you.

771
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:26,280
At the proper moment, they'll trigger you,

772
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,070
usually using some kind of auditory

773
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,290
or visual Pavlovian response mechanism.

774
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:33,000
-"Audi-what-ey"? -And when it's over...

775
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:36,250
What?

776
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:39,290
There's an after party?

777
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:42,460
Derek, get down!

778
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,180
You got to get to Maury Ballstein's computer.

779
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:52,640
He recorded everything in case they ever turned on him.

780
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:57,060
Derek, get a grip! Get a grip!

781
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:01,610
Good luck to you, Derek. I've always been a fan of Blue Steel.

782
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,740
And I hear Magnum is gonna blow us all away.

783
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:07,070
Come on !

784
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,830
-Get out of here. -Hang in there, J. P.

785
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:14,330
You freakin' idiot!

786
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,540
Man, that was close.

787
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:22,960
I can't believe Maury's in on it, too.

788
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:25,380
That she-male Katinka's not messing around.

789
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,090
You're telling me! For a second there,

790
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,430
I thought someone was gonna be reading our "eugoogoly."

791
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:31,850
Okay, all right, we need a place to hide.

792
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:34,640
Derek, where's the last place anyone would ever expect to look for you?

793
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,270
I don't know.

794
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:38,650
Think, okay? This is important!

795
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,610
I hate Hansel !

796
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:46,880
Hansel, Hansel! 

797
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,030
Everywhere I look! Hansel! Hansel, Hansel!

798
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,790
Were you looking for a rematch?

799
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,000
Excuse me, Hansel.

800
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:05,000
I don't think there's an easy way to put this,

801
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:06,710
so I am just gonna lay it out.

802
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:09,880
Derek has been brainwashed

803
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:13,510
to kill the prime minister of Malaysia.

804
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:15,560
And?

805
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:20,190
And we need a place to hide until we figure this whole thing out.

806
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:22,060
Derek said this would probably be

807
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:24,110
the last place anyone would look for him.

808
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:27,900
Yeah, you're cool to hide here.

809
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:31,280
But first, me and him got to straighten some shit out.

810
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,410
Fine.

811
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:42,210
Why you been acting so messed up towards me?

812
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:49,760
Well, you go first.

813
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:53,050
I don't know. Maybe I felt a little threatened or something,

814
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:56,100
'cause your career is, kind of, just blossoming,

815
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:58,850
and mine's, kind of, winding down or whatever.

816
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:01,600
And I felt like, "This guy's really hurting me,"

817
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:04,310
and it hurt.

818
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:09,690
And I felt like when you told me to Dere-lick my balls,

819
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,150
that really hurt.

820
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:14,870
Maybe I was scared, man. You're Derek Zoolander!

821
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:18,700
Yeah, you're Derek Zoolander.

822
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:20,370
You know what it's like to be another model

823
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,960
and be in Derek Zoolander's shadow?

824
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,130
You want to hear something crazy?

825
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:34,390
Your work

826
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:38,140
in the winter '95 International Male catalogue

827
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,860
made me want to be a model.

828
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,650
I freakin' worship you, man.

829
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,120
l'm sorry l was whack.

830
00:56:56,740 --> 00:57:00,120
I was whack.

831
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:11,090
So welcome to chez Hansel.

832
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:13,260
You're welcome to hide out here as long as you want.

833
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:15,840
Well, there isn't much time. The show's tomorrow night.

834
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:17,680
We have to figure out a plan by then.

835
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:21,640
I'll round up the troops here.

836
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:24,980
Hey, what's up, y'all? This is Derek and Matilda.

837
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:27,360
Derek, you know Natani and Chloe.

838
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:32,070
We got Buzzy Sullivan, big wave surfer from Maverick's.

839
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,570
This is this fantastic band, the Little Kings,

840
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,870
I met when I was ice sailing in Finland.

841
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:40,410
That's my Sherpa, Lapsang.

842
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:43,040
Okay, so, hey, everybody! Listen up for a second.

843
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:47,580
Derek and Matilda are in hiding 'cause some dudes brainwashed Derek,

844
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:49,750
to off the prime minister of Micronesia.

845
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,630
-Malaysia. -Right.

846
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:54,130
So, they're gonna be hiding here for a little while.

847
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,420
Let's show them a good time.

848
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:57,970
-Right on ! -All right, come on, over here.

849
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:00,390
Hey, Ennui, will you do me a favour?

850
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:02,470
Will you get me some of that tea that me and Lapsang got,

851
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,140
when we were free climbing the Mayan ruins?

852
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:14,070
This... This is really strong tea.

853
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,200
No, it's just right. Trust me.

854
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,910
What with all the intrigue you guys have been dealing with.

855
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:24,700
You know, Matilda, I'm surprised you're so worried about "Der-rock."

856
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:28,000
From that article that I read, it seems like

857
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,790
you don't really care too much about guys in our line of work.

858
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,090
Why do you hate models, Matilda?

859
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:37,590
-Honestly? -Yes.

860
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:43,930
I think they're vain, stupid and incredibly self-centred.

861
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:46,600
I totally agree with you.

862
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:50,940
But how do you feel about male models?

863
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:52,520
Sweet.

864
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:59,160
No, no! Okay, but seriously, Matil. Is it all right if I call you Matil?

865
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,910
What's the deal, yo-yo?

866
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,450
'Cause you're not telling us the whole story.

867
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,460
There's something else, isn't there?

868
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:09,870
You guys really want to know the truth?

869
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:13,340
-Yeah. -Okay, then I'm gonna tell you the truth.

870
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:20,930
When I was in seventh grade, I was the fat kid in my class.

871
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:27,390
All right, forget it.

872
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:30,390
-No. -Dude, be cool tonight. Come on.

873
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,940
I'm sorry. Please, go ahead. My mistake.

874
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:36,940
I was the one that all the pretty girls used to make fun of.

875
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:39,860
It was an awkward phase.

876
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,080
Anyway,

877
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,910
every day after school, I would come home and...

878
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,250
You know, I'd flip through the pages of my mom's Vogue and Glamour.

879
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:55,500
And I just...

880
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:56,920
I'd look at these women,

881
00:59:57,010 --> 01:00:00,840
these perfect, beautiful,

882
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:04,510
just unbelievable, skinny women.

883
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:06,850
I just couldn't...

884
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:09,890
Oh, I couldn't understand why I didn't look like them.

885
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:13,940
I... I just didn't get it. So...

886
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:20,030
So I became...

887
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:24,740
What?

888
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:29,200
Bulimic.

889
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,580
You can read minds?

890
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,590
It's when you throw up after every meal.

891
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,560
See, you know what? This is exactly what you models do to people.

892
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,810
You make them feel bad about themselves.

893
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:52,890
Matilda...

894
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,350
Matilda, it's just...

895
01:00:56,690 --> 01:01:00,440
So what? I throw up after lots of meals.

896
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:04,280
So do I. lt's a great way to lose pounds before a show.

897
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:08,120
Are you guys insane? Do you understand that it's a disease.

898
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,050
Wow. How did that affect you with guys? 

899
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:11,910
Did they not want to get busy with you?

900
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,370
-Good point. -Okay. You know what?

901
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:19,090
I'm not gonna sit here with both of you and discuss my sex life or...

902
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,760
Or lack thereof.

903
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:28,180
You mean, like, like you, like you...

904
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:29,930
-Haven't really... -You haven't...

905
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,770
-Done it... -Done it in a while, yeah.

906
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:35,640
Okay, what's a while? Like, eight days?

907
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:39,110
More?

908
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,110
Try a couple years.

909
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,450
Oh, snap!

910
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:49,490
How do you live? How do you live?

911
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:52,290
Seriously. Do you service yourself ten times a day?

912
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,660
-End of discussion ! -Easy. Okay, hold on.

913
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,210
-Easy, easy. -I'm not comfortable talking,

914
01:01:57,290 --> 01:01:59,000
-Easy. Easy. -This is...

915
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,340
This has been an emotional day for all of us.

916
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,510
I think we should get naked.

917
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,600
What?

918
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:12,680
Don't ask questions.

919
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:15,940
Just give in to the power of the tea.

920
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:00,940
So I'm rappelling down Mount Vesuvius,

921
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:04,070
when suddenly I slip and I start to fall.

922
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:06,070
I mean, I'm about to die. Hot bread, Zeke.

923
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:10,530
Just falling. I'll never forget the terror.

924
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:14,290
When suddenly I remember, "Holy shit. Hansel,

925
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:17,120
"haven't you been smoking peyote for six straight days?

926
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,960
"And couldn't some of this, maybe, be in your mind?"

927
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,380
And?

928
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:25,170
It was. I was totally fine.

929
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:27,380
I've never even been to Mount Vesuvius.

930
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,300
Cool story, Hansel.

931
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:31,760
Thanks, Olaf.

932
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:35,640
Dude, how dope was last night?

933
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:38,060
I mean, the soil room. Dirt was flying.

934
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:40,690
You couldn't see anything. It was like, who's that?

935
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:43,690
-Who's this? -I think I'm falling for Matilda, Hansel.

936
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:47,110
Dude, I wasn't gonna say anything,

937
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:50,450
but it was crazy energy flying back and forth between you guys.

938
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:52,110
It was like, look out!

939
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,820
There was a moment last night,

940
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:56,160
when she was sandwiched between the two Finnish dwarves

941
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:57,330
and the Maori tribesman...

942
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,580
-Yeah. -...where I thought,

943
01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:05,460
"Wow, I could really spend the rest of my life with this woman."

944
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:07,800
Really?

945
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:10,300
What do you call that?

946
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:13,090
l think you call that love, D-Bone.

947
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:20,430
So what time is it?

948
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:23,060
-Almost 5:00. -What?

949
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:25,900
Hey, guys, that show is in three hours.

950
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:29,110
Derek is dead unless we get that evidence. Do you guys...

951
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:33,450
Easy. How about a "Good afternoon, Derek and Hansel.

952
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:36,080
"Thanks for the freak fest last night"?

953
01:04:38,830 --> 01:04:40,830
-Hello? -Hello?

954
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:43,370
Hi, Katinka.

955
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:47,000
No, I just had a really late party night last night.

956
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:49,880
-Derek, hang up the phone now! -Where am I?

957
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:50,920
-Look, I have to go! -Hang up!

958
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:52,510
But I'll see you at 7:00. Okay, bye.

959
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:55,140
Derek, I thought I told you to turn off your phone.

960
01:04:55,890 --> 01:05:00,890
Turn off my phone?

961
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,890
-Yeah. -Earth to Matilda.

962
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:05,730
This phone is as much a part of me as...

963
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:09,650
You know what? Can we just cut it out with all the "Earth to's", please?

964
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:12,650
We're not actually saying this is the Earth calling you, Matilda.

965
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:16,160
Yeah. No, I got that. I understand you don't literally mean...

966
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,120
No, I don't think you do.

967
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:22,120
Listen. It's not like we think that we're actually in a control tower,

968
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:25,620
trying to reach outer space aliens or something, okay?

969
01:05:25,790 --> 01:05:29,500
Hello.

970
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:33,550
-Oh, snap! -A joke.

971
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:35,760
Okay, you know what?

972
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:39,260
Instead of doing that, I'm gonna try to figure out a way into Maury's,

973
01:05:39,350 --> 01:05:41,560
before Derek assassinates a world leader.

974
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:45,350
Wait a minute.

975
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:47,610
I might just have an idea.

976
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:51,190
They'll be looking for us at Maury's, right?

977
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:53,740
But they won't be looking for...

978
01:05:56,030 --> 01:05:57,030
Not us.

979
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:59,370
Derek, what are you talking about?

980
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:02,540
Hansel, do you have a cosmetics case?

981
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:05,500
Sure, I mean, just for touch-ups or whatever.

982
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:07,120
What are you gonna do with that?

983
01:06:08,210 --> 01:06:10,540
That'll do. Early in my career,

984
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:12,840
I used to do my own makeup styling and tailoring.

985
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:15,130
If I can create a basic disguise for us,

986
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:17,720
we may just be able to sneak into Maury's, undetected.

987
01:06:18,930 --> 01:06:22,060
You is talkin' loco and I like it.

988
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:50,750
Welcome to Derelicte.

989
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:55,050
Hansel calling Matil. Hansel calling Matil.

990
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:56,170
We have entry. Repeat.

991
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:58,260
-We have entry. -Okay, guys. I hear you.

992
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:01,100
Now, once you get the info, l want you to e-mail it to my office

993
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:02,430
and I'll download the files,

994
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:04,770
we'll rendezvous and take the information to the police.

995
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:06,180
We hear you loud and clear.

996
01:07:08,770 --> 01:07:09,900
Listen, Matil.

997
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,820
l've been thinking a lot about that bulimia thing.

998
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:16,860
And I want you to know I understand where you're coming from.

999
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:21,030
I feel really bad that good-looking people like us,

1000
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,280
made you throw up and feel bad about yourself.

1001
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,410
For serious.

1002
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,790
-Thanks, Derek. Now, hurry up. -Okay.

1003
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,500
Hey, I finally got the results

1004
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:35,460
on the name check you asked for on Jacobim Mugatu.

1005
01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:38,340
-Or should I say Jacob Moogberg. -What?

1006
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:40,840
He changed his name when he went into the fashion business.

1007
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:43,720
Apparently, the guy was the original guitar synth player,

1008
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:45,430
for that band Frankie Goes to Hollywood,

1009
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:47,020
but he got kicked out, before they hit it big

1010
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:48,810
with that song Relax.

1011
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:50,770
After the Frankie folks gave him the heave-ho,

1012
01:07:50,850 --> 01:07:53,150
he held a series of odd jobs until,

1013
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:57,570
get this, he invented the piano-key necktie in 1985.

1014
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:00,030
The guy's been a fashion designer ever since.

1015
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:07,240
First obstacle.

1016
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:12,920
You ever use one of these?

1017
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,460
I don't think so.

1018
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:19,090
Watch out. Watch... Fix that hem, Jason.

1019
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:21,340
Please. I need... Katinka!

1020
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:23,930
He's not here yet, Jacobim.

1021
01:08:24,010 --> 01:08:27,140
-That little toad-face better show. -He will show.

1022
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:30,180
Good, because I'm a hot little potato right now.

1023
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:34,480
There must be an "on" button somewhere.

1024
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:36,650
Did you press that apple thing?

1025
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:25,610
Wait! Hansel !

1026
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:27,660
Let's not lose our cool.

1027
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:29,200
Then we're no better than the machine.

1028
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:33,710
lt's almost 7:00. I got to go.

1029
01:09:33,790 --> 01:09:36,210
No! Derek. Der, wait.

1030
01:09:36,290 --> 01:09:38,670
If you go, they'll make you kill that Eurasian dude.

1031
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:41,880
I don't care, Hansel. I've never been late for a show in my life.

1032
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:43,800
I don't plan on starting now.

1033
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:45,880
Damn it, you're right.

1034
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,600
Do me a favour.

1035
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:51,140
If anything happens to me, I want you to give this to Matilda.

1036
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:54,730
-No. -Please, Hansel. Take it. Please.

1037
01:09:54,810 --> 01:09:56,770
-Man. -Take it.

1038
01:09:59,110 --> 01:10:03,190
Let's just say I'll hold on to it till you get back.

1039
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:05,610
Go! Go!

1040
01:10:06,450 --> 01:10:08,530
We're live at the Derelicte show,

1041
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:11,080
where controversial designer Jacobim Mugatu,

1042
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:12,620
has extended the olive branch

1043
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:14,830
to the Malaysian Prime Minister Hassan,

1044
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:17,120
making him the guest of honour at tonight's show.

1045
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:20,920
And starring in that show, veteran supermodel Derek Zootander.

1046
01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:27,550
Guys, what's happening? Did you find the files?

1047
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:28,970
Matilda, we've got problems.

1048
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:30,890
Derek's already left for the show.

1049
01:10:30,970 --> 01:10:33,600
No. No, he can't. We don't even know what the trigger is.

1050
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:36,270
He just went running out of here. I couldn't stop him.

1051
01:10:36,730 --> 01:10:39,190
-I'll call him on his phone. -He doesn't have it.

1052
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:41,230
-What? -Yeah, he doesn't have it.

1053
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,440
What are you talking about? He always has it.

1054
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:46,780
-No, he gave it to me. -Did you find the files?

1055
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:49,070
I don't even know what they... What do they look like?

1056
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:50,660
They're in the computer.

1057
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:52,950
They're in the computer?

1058
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:56,120
Yeah, they're definitely in there. I just don't know how he labelled them.

1059
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:58,580
-I got it. -You got to figure it out.

1060
01:10:58,710 --> 01:11:00,210
We're running out of time, Hansel,

1061
01:11:00,290 --> 01:11:02,460
you got to find them and meet me at the show.

1062
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:03,920
Roger.

1063
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:06,880
In the computer.

1064
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:09,430
It's so simple.

1065
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:13,430
Hey, I just cut up a couple of cantaloupe halves,

1066
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:15,270
with some cottage cheese, if you're hungry.

1067
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:17,940
Not the right time. I need to figure out this trigger

1068
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:20,480
before Derek kills the Malaysian prime minister.

1069
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:23,320
You just seem a little tense. I was trying to help you relax.

1070
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:26,650
Relax? The last thing I need to do right now is...

1071
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,160
-That's it. -Let's go, people!

1072
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:34,700
Let's go! Vagrants and whores, you're wanted in Makeup!

1073
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:36,700
Runaways and street hustlers, you're next!

1074
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,790
-You had us worried, Derek. -Everything's cool.

1075
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:42,830
-l'm really super psyched for the show. -Good.

1076
01:11:43,290 --> 01:11:46,590
Just remember, relax.

1077
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:48,670
Two minutes, Derek.

1078
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,090
There he is.

1079
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,560
I just want to wish you good luck.

1080
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,560
Don't you mean "Good-bye"?

1081
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:00,390
What are you talking?

1082
01:12:04,610 --> 01:12:06,570
I know it was you, Maury.

1083
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:08,240
I know it was you,

1084
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:10,070
and it breaks my heart.

1085
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:12,700
Derek, l don't know what you're talking.

1086
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:18,080
Derek, I'm...

1087
01:12:20,710 --> 01:12:21,960
I'm sorry.

1088
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:31,050
Glad you could join us, Kmart.

1089
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:34,430
Lucky for you, there is no dress code.

1090
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:38,770
I am vile spew

1091
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:40,680
of the wretched masses.

1092
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:45,190
I am really, really dirty.

1093
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:48,230
I am Derelicte!

1094
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,080
You make me sick to my stomach, Jaco.

1095
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:08,670
It'll all be over soon.

1096
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:11,800
Derek Zoolander will be dead and you'll be fine.

1097
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:14,050
You always are.

1098
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:15,260
Come on, Derek. You're on.

1099
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:19,510
Break a leg, Derek.

1100
01:13:51,670 --> 01:13:52,670
Derek...

1101
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:54,880
It's Relax!

1102
01:13:54,970 --> 01:13:55,970
I hate you.

1103
01:13:56,050 --> 01:13:58,550
I'm fine. I've done this a thousand times.

1104
01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:01,220
The trigger! It's...

1105
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:15,610
Concentrate, Derelicte.

1106
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:20,280
Do not be distracted by the beautiful celebrities.

1107
01:14:20,370 --> 01:14:22,040
Celebrities.

1108
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:33,050
Do what you've been trained to do and kill the Malaysian prime minister!

1109
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:48,650
Just do it already!

1110
01:14:58,570 --> 01:14:59,740
D-Bone, I got your back!

1111
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:01,990
What?

1112
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,120
It's that damn Hansel !

1113
01:15:06,410 --> 01:15:07,790
He's so hot right now!

1114
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:10,920
Popping and locking, fool !

1115
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:15,510
They're break-dance fighting.

1116
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:23,410
Derek Zoolander just tried to kill the prime minister of Malaysia.

1117
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:28,750
That's bullshit! Listen up, everyone.

1118
01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:30,330
Mugatu's a dick!

1119
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:34,000
He tried to brainwash Derek to kill the Claymation dude.

1120
01:16:36,170 --> 01:16:39,800
That's a lie! Zoolander snapped because he's over the hill !

1121
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:41,970
He knew his career was over and he couldn't face it.

1122
01:16:42,050 --> 01:16:43,510
No way, compadre.

1123
01:16:43,970 --> 01:16:47,560
We got 30 years of files right here in this computer!

1124
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:49,390
They're gonna bring you down !

1125
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:51,180
Oh, no.

1126
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:52,520
Down !

1127
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:58,150
Where did all the files go?

1128
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,530
I'm taking you out!

1129
01:17:02,450 --> 01:17:04,860
Yo, taste my pain, bitch !

1130
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:12,370
Deal with that!

1131
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:18,920
You don't have the guts, Kmart!

1132
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:21,340
Wanna bet? And by the way,

1133
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:23,300
you were wrong about my outfit.

1134
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:26,850
It's the Cheryl Ladd Collection, and I got it at J.C. Penney.

1135
01:17:27,470 --> 01:17:28,970
On sale.

1136
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:37,190
Jig's up, Mugatu. Everything they're saying is true.

1137
01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:39,570
I've been in on it for 30 years.

1138
01:17:39,690 --> 01:17:41,440
What are you doing, Ballstein?

1139
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:45,490
I'm done, Jaco. I got a prostate the size of a honeydew,

1140
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:47,320
and a head full of bad memories.

1141
01:17:47,410 --> 01:17:49,330
It's time to set things straight.

1142
01:17:49,410 --> 01:17:53,620
You have no evidence. Han-stupid destroyed everything.

1143
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:57,330
I got two words for you, sugar, Zip disc.

1144
01:17:57,590 --> 01:18:00,500
The whole thing is in my den in Long Island.

1145
01:18:00,590 --> 01:18:02,880
I can have that evidence here in 20 minutes.

1146
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:04,880
-That a boy, Maury. -Hold on a second.

1147
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:06,430
I'm afraid of the radiation.

1148
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:12,350
Sheila, honey, it's me. Listen.

1149
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:15,940
I need you to bring that Zip disc in the den down to the fashion show.

1150
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:19,940
I don't care what the traffic is like.

1151
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,860
Take the God damn service road and get off before the bridge.

1152
01:18:25,530 --> 01:18:27,740
So put it in one of those Tupperware containers

1153
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:29,820
and I'll heat it up in the microwave when I get home.

1154
01:18:30,870 --> 01:18:34,620
For Christ's sake, it's a casserole, Sheila! It'll stay!

1155
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:37,210
Shut up!

1156
01:18:37,290 --> 01:18:39,250
Enough already, Ballstein !

1157
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:42,250
Who cares about Derek Zoolander, anyway?

1158
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:45,470
The man has only one look, for Christ's sake!

1159
01:18:45,590 --> 01:18:48,430
Blue Steel, Ferrari, Le Tigre?

1160
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,260
They're the same face!

1161
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:55,850
Doesn't anyone notice this? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!

1162
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:00,610
I invented the piano-key necktie!

1163
01:19:00,690 --> 01:19:02,520
I invented it!

1164
01:19:02,610 --> 01:19:05,360
What have you done, Derek? Nothing !

1165
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:08,700
You've done nothing ! Nothing !

1166
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:12,870
And I will be a monkey's uncle if I have you ruin this for me!

1167
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:16,160
Because if you can't get the job done, then I will !

1168
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:18,870
Die, you wage-hiking scum !

1169
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:24,550
One look?

1170
01:19:25,630 --> 01:19:29,130
One look? I don't think so!

1171
01:19:41,690 --> 01:19:43,150
There it is!

1172
01:19:43,230 --> 01:19:44,360
Magnum !

1173
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:47,190
Holy moly.

1174
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:50,530
Yeah, baby! That's what I've been waiting for!

1175
01:19:50,910 --> 01:19:54,160
Dear God. lt's beautiful.

1176
01:20:16,810 --> 01:20:20,140
That's my kid. That's my son.

1177
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:27,730
Derek!

1178
01:20:28,110 --> 01:20:32,280
l love that kid. Dumb as a stump, but I love him.

1179
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:34,320
Derek, you did it! That was amazing !

1180
01:20:34,410 --> 01:20:36,580
I know. I turned left!

1181
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:38,790
Yeah, that too. But, Derek,

1182
01:20:38,870 --> 01:20:40,910
you saved the prime minister of Malaysia!

1183
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:43,500
Right. Cool.

1184
01:20:44,250 --> 01:20:47,250
Thank you, Derek Zoolander, for saving my life.

1185

01:21:59,030 --> 01:22:01,700
than just being really, really, really good-looking.

1206
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:03,620
-Right, kids? -Right!

1207
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:04,960
And cut!

1208

-Looks great. I think we got it. -All right, Mitch. Thanks.

1209
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:11,800
-All right, everybody! That's a wrap! -Hey, Hansel.

1210
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:13,470
Hey, D-Rock, 

1211
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:15,470
I'm gonna take these kids over to the George Washington Bridge,

1212
01:22:15,550 --> 01:22:17,510
give them a little lesson in base jumping.

1213
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,140
I'll catch you in the teacher's lounge later on?

1214
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:20,260
All right.

1215
01:22:20,350 --> 01:22:23,020
All right, guys. Last one to the helicopter's a rotten egg. Let's go!

1216
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:26,140
Hey, Matilda!

1217
01:22:26,230 --> 01:22:29,270
There's Daddy! Hi.

1218
01:22:29,690 --> 01:22:31,190
-How's Derek, Jr? -He's great.

1219
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,530
Guess what. He made his first look today.

1220
01:22:33,690 --> 01:22:34,740
Really?

1221
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:36,650
You wanna show Daddy your look, Derek, Jr?

1222
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:47,500
-Wanna hang out for story hour? -Great. Yeah. Let's go.

1223
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:50,710
Hey, who wants to hear a story?
