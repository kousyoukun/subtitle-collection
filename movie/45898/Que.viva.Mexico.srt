QUE VlVA MEXlCO!

7
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,717
Mexico, 1931

8
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,233
Sergei Eisenstein,
the film director.

9
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,279
His assitants:
Edward Tisse, cameraman...

10
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,312
and me, Grigory Alexandrov,
director.

11
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,990
How did we land
in this amazing country?

12
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,351
Sergei Eisenstein's films
of the 20's...

13
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,040
especially ''The Battleship Potemkin,''
won him renown.

14
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,434
He, and we along with him...

15
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,952
were invited to Hollywood
to make a film.

16
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,550
But Eisenstein didn't see
eye to eye...

17
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,314
with the Hollywood tycoons.

18
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,388
Helped by Upton Sinclair,
the American writer...

19
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,191
we decided to shoot a film
about Mexico.

20
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,755
But first there was much
we had to learn...

21
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,437
about that country.

22
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,354
The great Mexican painters,
Diego Rivera...

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,228
David Siqueiros...

24
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,354
and Jose Orozco...

25
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,553
were our guides and teachers.

26
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,349
We spent two months filming.

27
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,678
We travelled north to south,
east to west...

28
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,996
driving thousands of miles
along rugged roads.

29
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,038
A feature of this land...

30
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,310
struck us as amazing.

31
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,108
A hundred miles meant
the difference between epochs...

32
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,514
separating the pre-Columbian
Mexico...

33
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,076
from that of the time
of the Spanish conquest...

34
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,392
the Mexico of the feudal rule...

35
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,235
from modern Mexico.

36
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,476
Eisenstein felt
that this unusual country...

37
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,674
deserved an unusual film and
that Mexico's tragic story...

38
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,597
could be told
without actors or sets.

39
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,431
A script was written...

40
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,630
and we began making
Que Viva Mexico!

41
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,954
Our filming crew...

42
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,194
consisted of only us three.

43
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,070
But we were young.

44
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,232
We were ready to move mountains.

45
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,914
Even so, we did not manage
to complete shooting

46
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,519
or editing the film.

47
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,838
All our reels of film were held up

48
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,589
in Hollywood, where they
had been developed and printed.

49
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,238
Later they landed in the Museum
of Modern Art in New York.

50
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,912
They were turned over to us

51
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,714
only a short time ago...

52
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,392
after nearly half a century
of negociations.

53
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,549
Eisenstein and Tisse

54
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,159
are no longer with us...

55
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,715
but what they did
belongs to the living.

56
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,512
You will see the film...

57
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,234
as Eisenstein conceived it...

58
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,669
and as we planned it.

59
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,958
We do not know
what the great director...

60
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,234
would have done
with the picture today.

61
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,111
But using his script and drawings,

62
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,390
we have tried...

63
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,990
to get as close as possible
to what he had in mind.

64
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,794
The film was to consist
of several parts...

65
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,069
some close to being documentary
and some acted.

66
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,200
On the whole,
it was intended to be...

67
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,949
a colourful film symphony
of Mexico.

68
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,990
QUE VlVA MEXlCO!

69
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,437
''Prologue''

70
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,271
The time in the prologue...

71
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,993
is eternity.

72
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,548
lt could all be taking place today...

73
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,155
or have happened 20 years ago...

74
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,479
or even a thousand years ago.

75
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,353
''The text is by Eisenstein.
lt is read by S. Bondarchuk.''

76
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,278
Stone.

77
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,552
Gods.

78
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,273
People.

79
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,029
A land of sacred ruins
and huge pyramids.

80
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,117
Men and women with the features

81
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,753
of their ancestors.

82
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,230
The pagan temples
of holy cities.

83
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,438
A kingdom of death...

84
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,836
where the past
dominates the present.

85
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,235
And faces like those
hewn in stone-

86
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:19,072
like those...

87
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,835
of the Mexicans of old.

88
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,391
Symbolic reminder of the past:

89
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,756
a funeral

90
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,030
amidst dead ruins.

91
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,152
ln total bondage...

92
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,511
to the idea of death,
of man's physical end.

93
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,077
Tropical Tehuantepec.

94
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,958
Here time flows slowly...

95
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,116
to the accomplishment
of the rustle of the palm fronds.

96
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,318
The way of life
remains unchanged for centuries.

97
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,512
At its dawn,
the world must have been full...

98
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,792
of the same regal indolence.

99
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,196
''The Sandunga''

100
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,437
Girls sing the sandunga
as they daydream of the future.

101
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,278
Full of pride
in her youthful beauty.

102
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,119
Concepcion.

103
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,839
Her most cherished dream -
a gold necklace.

104
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,599
A dream shared
by every girl in Tehuantepec.

105
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,518
The necklace is her dowry,
her key to marital bliss.

106
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,673
The woman works,
she chooses a husband for herself...

107
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,278
and she brings him
into their new house.

108
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,032
Matriarchate.
Rule by the women.

109
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,350
Here the girls go to work early
and save every copper...

110
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,277
to acquire a necklace
of gold coins...

111
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,558
by the time they are 16 or 18.

112
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,312
Concepcion needs one more
gold coin - just one -

113
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,114
for her dream to be realized.

114
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,472
May your necklace
bring you happiness!

115
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,199
Abundio, the object
of Concepcion's affection.

116
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,757
lsn't this what you wanted,

117
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,876
Concepcion?

118
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,313
What you dreamed of for so long?

119
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,311
The matter passes into the hands...
of the mothers and matchmakers.

120
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,030
They inspect the dowry.

121
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,714
How many coins in the necklace?

122
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,952
Are they pure gold?

123
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,550
The whole population
of Tehuantepec...

124
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,352
takes part in the event.

125
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:26,633
A slow, semi-vegetative
existence.

126
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,239
A way of life...

127
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,470
that has not changed
over the centuries.

128
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,634
As the years go by,
new flowers blossom.

129
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,597
''Fiesta''

130
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,196
The action of this story is set...

131
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,312
during the Feast of
the Holy Virgin of Guadalupe.

132
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,754
But this is also
an annual reminder...

133
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,190
of Spain's conversion
of Mexico...

134
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,517
into a colony
of bloodshed and suffering.

135
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,399
ln the 16th century.

136
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,079
Cortes conquered Mexico

137
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,359
The monks who came with him

138
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,633
wiped out pagan cults...

139
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,796
with fire and sword.

140
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,869
On pyramids once crowned

141
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,993
by Aztec and Toltec temples...

142
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,670
the Spaniards erected
Catholic churches...

143
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,353
so as not to change
the routes of the pilgrims...

144
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,870
who had been coming there
for thousands of years.

145
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,595
A mystery play, in which
the pilgrims who enact it...

146
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,195
portray the sufferings
of Jesus.

147
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,428
Sharp prickles penetrate
the bodies...

148
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,231
of those who make crosses
out of cactus stems...

149
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,757
and, with these tied
on their shoulders...

150
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,834
crawl for hours
to the top of the pyramid.

151
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,877
Masks of devils,

152
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,469
pagan gods...

153
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,434
and Spanish conquistadors
side by side.

154
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,430
The dance goes on
from dawn to dusk.

155
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,234
Without a pause.
Over and over again...

156
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,840
they repeat the same steps...

157
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,759
in honor of the Holy Virgin.

158
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,353
Or perhaps - who knows -

159
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,796
of a more ancient goddess -

160
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,514
the awesome mother of gods

161
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:00,353
Then the gory finale,
the bullfight.

162
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,078
lntroduced by the Spaniards...

163
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,795
and now a national spectacle
of the Mexicans.

164
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:12,913
David Liseaga,
a famous Mexican matador.

165
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,672
His younger brother.

166
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,032
Baronito, a picador.

167
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,552
They call on their mother...

168
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,196
to say good-bye to her...

169
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,870
perhaps for the last time.

170
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,429
Today is a day when the toreros
will kill bulls...

171
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,553
in honor of the Virgin.

172
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,478
The chosen queens
of the bullfight.

173
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,869
The razor's edge...

174
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,913
between death and victory.

175
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,357
Among the local belles...

176
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,596
Baronito catches sight
of his lady love...

177
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,392
Se?ora Calderon.

178
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,830
What else is there
for the poor picador to do?

179
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:35,479
Mexico, tender and lyrical.
And also cruel.

180
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:53,353
Above the high hacienda walls...

181
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,551
floats a plaintive song.

182
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,914
The peons beg the Holy Virgin

183
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,159
to ease their sufferings...
on the day now dawning.

184
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:25,351
The time: the beginning
of the 20th century...

185
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:31,076
during the reign
of dictator Porfirio Diaz.

186
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,315
''Maguey''

187
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:49,436
Native to the hilly country
of the state of Hidalgo...

188
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,958
is a large cactus named maguey.

189
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,829
These lands...

190
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,589
are a part
of the Tetlapayac hacienda...

191
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,031
in Llanos de Apam.

192
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:06,757
Their lot, day after day,
is to suck out...

193
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,077
the thick juice
from the heart of the cactus.

194
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,071
The juice will ferment
and be ready to drink.

195
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,829
The strong, milky white beverage

196
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,598
is called pulque.

197
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,433
Sebastian, a peon,
is at work in the fields.

198
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,438
His betrothed, Maria,
is brought by her parents.

199
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,117
Felicio, Sebastian's
younger brother.

200
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,559
The landlords and his friends.

201
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,508
Every bride-to-be on the estate
must be shown to the master.

202
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:54,636
The old man's daughter Sara...
arrives with her cousin.

203
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,393
A family holiday.

204
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:02,513
The landlord celebrates.

205
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,716
Maria is forgotten.

206
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:03,430
The naive girl is unaware
of what is in store for her.

207
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:10,028
Fate takes the form
of a drunken guest.

208
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,034
Hatred sparks a plot.

209
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,836
Three of his comrades
and Felicio, his brother-

210
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,474
They will help him
to take revenge.

211
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,590
They want to free Maria.

212
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:07,670
Slumbering Mexico. Enslaved Mexico
Fermenting Mexico

213
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:12,638
And finally, fighting
revolutionary Mexico

214
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,674
But that last part
remained undone

215
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:20,638
The picture's small budget
was used up...

216
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,397
and shooting came to an end.

217
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:26,069
We returned home.

218
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:31,712
''Soldadera''

219
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,791
was intended to depict Mexico...

220
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,748
during the uprising of 1910

221
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:41,674
a country engulfed
in the flames of civil war...

222
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:44,553
divided into hostile camps...

223
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:49,233
and then united by the victory
of the revolution.

224
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:53,669
The Mexican people at arms...

225
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:57,471
were to be the heroes of this story.

226
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,434
Soldaderas are the wives
of soldiers.

227
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,953
They broke into villages
and captured provisions...

228
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:10,995
to feed their weary men.

229
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:17,230
The soldaderas were always
beside the men.

230
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,355
The soldadera to us
was to have been...

231
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,949
a symbol of Mexico itself -

232
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:26,118
a symbol of land
whose people came to realize...

233
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:29,869
that strength lies in unity...

234
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,479
and that they must unite
to fight reaction.

235
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,958
''Epilogue''

236
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,389
The time.1931

237
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:49,150
The place. Mexico.

238
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:54,712
Another holiday,
the Day of the Dead.

239
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:59,237
On this day, November 2 ...
the emblem of death

240
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:02,398
and, above all, skulls...
are everywhere.

241
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:19,751
The day begins
with mourning for the dead.

242
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:06,628
Revelry in cemeteries,
eating on gravestones...

243
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:10,355
lovemaking in the cemetery shrubbery.

244
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:37,316
From candles and food
in the graveyard...

245
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:40,754
to a rollicking carnival.

246
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:59,156
The Mexican scorns death.

247
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,910
What is more...
the Mexican mocks death.

248
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,510
Chocolate coffins

249
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:19,153
complete with sugar corpse.

250
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,590
And at the day's end,
all this goes...

251
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:26,032
into the bronzed bellies
of Mexican children.

252
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:43,594
A skull under a minister's
top hat...

253
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:47,197
a fireman's helmet,
a policeman's cap...

254
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:50,359
a general's cocked hat.

255
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:09,711
Not a cult of death this,
not the stillness of stone...

256
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:14,198
or the awesomeness
of stone idols...

257
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:16,155
No!

258
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:20,753
But man's triumph over death
through mockery of it.

259
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:42,428
The masks are removed.

260
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:47,232
Not sham skulls now
but real ones.

261
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:52,512
The corpses of a doom class.

262
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:23,875
Whom will we see
behind this mask?

263
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:28,356
A soldadera's son?

264
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:33,350
One of whose hands
are destined to forge...

265
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:37,191
a truly free Mexico?

266
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:47,596
QUE VlVA MEXlCO!
