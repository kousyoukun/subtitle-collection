2
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:58,624
沒有幾個人知道完整的故事經過
Few know the whole story.

3
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:01,761
就我回憶 其實是這樣的...
From what I recall, it goes something like this...

4
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,797
在故事開始之前
Before history began,

5
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,800
埃及是世界萬物的誕生地
Egypt was the birthplace of all life.

6
00:01:07,802 --> 00:01:11,437
由眾神創造的天選之國
A paradise worthy of the gods who created it.

7
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,740
所以眾神選擇居住在這
So the gods decided to live there

8
00:01:13,742 --> 00:01:14,974
與他們創造的劣等生物一起生活
alongside their lesser creation,

9
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:16,476
人類
man.

10
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:19,645
雖然居住在一起
But there was no mistaking the gods

11
00:01:19,647 --> 00:01:21,381
但是人類敬拜著眾神們
amongst the mortals who worshipped them.

12
00:01:21,383 --> 00:01:23,015
眾神更加高大
The gods were taller

13
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:25,051
身體堿y淌著黃金 而不是血液
with gold running through their veins instead of blood.

14
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,420
而且他們能隨時隨地
And they could transform at will

15
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:31,124
變身成各種駭人的野獸
into all manner of frightening beasts.

16
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:38,564
而埃及被一對兄弟一分為二分開統治
Egypt itself was divided between two mighty brothers.

17
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:41,801
奧西奡 豐饒神 被人民愛戴
Osiris, the god of life, was the beloved king

18
00:01:41,803 --> 00:01:43,836
統治著尼羅河周邊的富饒土地
of all the lands made bountiful by the nile.

19
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:49,842
他弟弟 賽特(荒漠神) 則統治著寸草不生的荒漠
His brother, set, ruled the far barren desert

20
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:54,414
暗地堣@直儲備力量 憎恨著他哥哥
finding both strength and bitterness in his isolation.

21
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:57,483
後來奧西奡絲Ёぁ[冕新王
But then the time came for osiris to crown a new king.

22
00:01:57,485 --> 00:02:00,553
也就是他唯一的兒子 荷魯斯(天空神)
His only son, horus.

23
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:02,889
這個決定考驗了兄弟的團結
It was a decision that would test the brothers' bond

24
00:02:02,891 --> 00:02:04,624
也影響了全埃及的命運
and the fate of all Egypt.

25
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:26,879
但是這故事堨u有一半是關於眾神的
But the gods are only half our tale.

26
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,747
眾所周知
It had become clear

27
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,951
眾神無法僅靠自身之力就決定世界的命運
that they couldn't shape the course of destiny alone.

28
00:02:31,953 --> 00:02:34,153
還需要一個 判斷力
A man of exceptional judgment,

29
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:37,023
智慧 以及勇氣都過人的男人
wisdom and fortitude would be needed.

30
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:41,861
很不幸 我不是這麼優秀的人
Unfortunately, I was not such a man.

31
00:02:41,863 --> 00:02:44,130
在你們批評年輕的我之前
But before you dismiss my younger foolhardy self,

32
00:02:44,132 --> 00:02:45,231
請記住...
remember...

33
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,468
千萬不要低估
Never doubt a man

34
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,003
一個為了追求 和眾神一般強大的東西 奮鬥的男人
fighting for the one thing as powerful as any god.

35
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:51,904
三百 太貴了
Three hundred, impossible.

36
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:52,705
愛情
Love.

37
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,607
這是市場最低價了
It's the best price.

38
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,478
小偷 !
Thief!

39
00:02:59,948 --> 00:03:00,880
站住 !
Stop!

40
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:06,752
這裙子太難看了
This dress is hopeless.

41
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:08,087
想要參加明天的加冕禮
I need to buy some ribbon to even begin

42
00:03:08,089 --> 00:03:10,523
還得買些緞帶才行
to make it suitable for the coronation.

43
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:12,758
那我們明天一起過吧
I say we spend tomorrow together instead.

44
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,895
我們明天本來就是一起過 一起去參加加冕禮
We are spending tomorrow together. At the coronation.

45
00:03:15,897 --> 00:03:17,096
仁慈的上帝會賜予我們
We're blessed the gods shall give us

46
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:18,130
一位新國王
a new king in our lifetime.

47
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:19,732
荷魯斯 ?
Horus?

48
00:03:19,734 --> 00:03:21,234
你明白我根本不在乎眾神的
You know I couldn't care less about the gods.

49
00:03:21,236 --> 00:03:22,068
可他們在乎你
Well, they care about you.

50
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,137
- 是嗎 ?  - 快還給我
Oh, yeah? Bek! Give it back.

51
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,107
我知道你希望穿漂亮的裙子
I knew you wanted to wear something special.

52
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:34,780
這是你從商店偷的
Did you steal it from a shopkeeper

53
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:36,749
還是從別人衣櫃堸蔽 ?
or from someone's closet?

54
00:03:36,751 --> 00:03:37,950
總比等待眾神回應我的祈禱
It was quicker than waiting for the gods

55
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:38,985
快多了
to answer my prayers.

56
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,757
眾神給予了我們一切
The gods give us everything we need.

57
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,626
是的 他們無限慷慨
Yes. Their generosity knows no bounds.

58
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,295
你真漂亮
You look beautiful.

59
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,232
薩亞 我當時叫你和我私奔的時候
Zaya, when I asked you to run away with me,

60
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:55,067
我給你承諾過舒適的生活
I promised you a good life.

61
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:57,803
還會送你很多華貴的裙子
Dresses worthy of a Princess.

62
00:03:57,805 --> 00:03:59,272
每天都送新的
A new one every day.

63
00:03:59,274 --> 00:04:01,007
用無數珠寶來襯托你
Rivers of jewels to adorn you.

64
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:02,608
還能住在黃金皇宮養育家庭
A golden palace to raise our family.

65
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,210
那我們會有多少孩子 ?
And how many children would we have?

66
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:07,213
十多個
A dozen.

67
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,950
我願意做任何事換你開心
I would do anything to make you happy.

68
00:04:10,952 --> 00:04:12,985
而荷魯斯 即將上任的國王
And how was horus, the king-to-be,

69
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:14,854
是怎麼為加冕禮做準備的呢 ?
preparing for his great day?

70
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:22,094
天空神
Lord of the air.

71
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:26,198
昨晚又忙活了吧
Quite an occasion last night.

72
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,199
人們都已經聚集過來了
Already crowds press cheek-to-cheek

73
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:29,101
都是來看看您風采的
to catch a glimpse of you.

74
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:30,336
您會非常莊嚴輝煌
You will look splendid.

75
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:33,039
就現在這樣可不行
Eventually.

76
00:04:40,148 --> 00:04:42,848
但也別就這樣低估荷魯斯了
But don't discount horus yet either.

77
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,183
當要決定世界命運
Because when it comes to the fate of the world

78
00:04:44,185 --> 00:04:46,619
的時刻
in one's hands,

79
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:49,021
就算是眾神 也會被自身的力量所震撼
even gods can be surprised by the strength they possess.

80
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:57,897
如果是我要當國王的話
If I was to be crowned,

81
00:04:57,899 --> 00:04:59,599
我會在儀式前抽點時間
I might have spent the preceding hours

82
00:04:59,601 --> 00:05:01,133
準備好演講稿
composing a message for my people.

83
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:03,069
難道人們還能更愛他嗎 ?
Could the people love him more?

84
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:05,738
或許荷魯斯大人覺得不用搞那些陳詞爛調
Maybe lord horus doesn't think we need boring speeches.

85
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,773
事關自己的榮耀就得準備
Except when it comes to toasting his own glory.

86
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:09,942
我都為人們做得夠多了
Many toasts were required.

87
00:05:09,944 --> 00:05:12,211
我的所作所為都被書寫成詩歌了
I was doing deeds of which songs will be sung.

88
00:05:12,213 --> 00:05:14,747
他當初殺死的那隻大獅子的確破壞了很多村莊
The great lion he slayed was terrorizing villages.

89
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:17,383
是嗎 ? 太好了 又一個詩歌材料
It was? Good. All the more song-worthy.

90
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:20,686
真舒服
That's nice.

91
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:25,324
不用了 謝謝...
That's fine, thank...

92
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:27,994
是你
You.

93
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:30,396
真遺憾我遲到了
A shame I've come too late.

94
00:05:30,398 --> 00:05:32,865
不過我還是來了 又清醒又穿了衣服
But here I am, sober and clothed.

95
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,034
別告訴別人
Don't tell anyone.

96
00:05:35,036 --> 00:05:36,902
我還得維持名聲呢
I have a bad reputation to keep.

97
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:39,171
過來
Come here. Come.

98
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,273
不不不 !
No. No, no. No, no!

99
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,853
不敢相信 你穿這身衣服還真有模有樣的
Hard to believe, but you look like a king.

100
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:55,988
如果這樣你就興奮了 我也不好說什麼
If that's what excites you, who am I to judge?

101
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,756
珠寶能讓我興奮
Jewelry excites me.

102
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:58,891
那看看你自己的手腕
Then look to your wrist,

103
00:05:58,893 --> 00:06:00,326
如果你不嫌太華麗的話
if the effort is not too great.

104
00:06:00,328 --> 00:06:02,928
42星手鐲
The bracelet of 42 stars.

105
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,364
別忘記當初我為了你殺的那些惡魔
To remind you of the demons I slayed for you.

106
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,433
埃及從沒見過的貴重寶物
A more valuable treasure Egypt has never known.

107
00:06:07,435 --> 00:06:09,268
就這老玩意 ?
This old thing?

108
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,038
為什麼愛神卻不明白愛是什麼東西 ?
How can the goddess of love not know what love is?

109
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,940
到處睡女人可不算愛
It's not bedding any girl who flutters her eyelashes,

110
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:17,309
勇猛的巨獅獵手
mighty lion-slayer.

111
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:18,557
我當時只是在慶祝而已
I was celebrating the hunt.

112
00:06:18,558 --> 00:06:20,312
如果你在現場你就明白了
You would know that had you been here.

113
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:23,416
我看重自己的自由 不怎麼看重動物屍體
I value my freedom. Dead animals less so.

114
00:06:23,418 --> 00:06:25,151
可你把它們穿在身上卻沒什麼意見
Well, you have no problem wearing them.

115
00:06:25,153 --> 00:06:27,153
- 噢  - 哈索爾(愛神) 別
Oh... Hathor, don't.

116
00:06:27,155 --> 00:06:29,155
別
Don't.

117
00:06:29,157 --> 00:06:31,023
這可不是王后該有的樣子
That's no way for a queen to behave.

118
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:33,726
那還好我不是女王
Then it's a good thing I'm not a queen.

119
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:35,728
你能想出比整天坐在王座上
Can you imagine anything more dull than sitting

120
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,429
更無聊的事嗎 ?
on a throne all day?

121
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,201
你到底是想問我什麼 ?
What exactly are you asking me?

122
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,071
我有問你什麼事嗎 ?
Did I ask you something?

123
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,074
我不確定 你說啊
I'm not sure. Did you?

124
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,180
大人
My lord.

125
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,182
儀式開始了
It's starting.

126
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,469
哈索爾 愛神 !
Hathor, goddess of love!

127
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:09,355
奈芙蒂斯 守護神 !
Nephthys, goddess of protection!

128
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:17,997
- 先生  - 噢...
Sir. Oh...

129
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,399
謝謝你 小伙子
Thank you, young man.

130
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:24,336
你今天對陌生人怎麼這麼友善
You've been awfully nice to strangers today.

131
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:25,271
把手伸出來
Show me your hands.

132
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,508
幹嘛 ? 這是送給奧西奡答甄妒
What? Gifts for osiris.

133
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,376
快走吧
Hurry up!

134
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,580
托特 睿智神 !
Thoth, god of wisdom!

135
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,221
你好 托特
Greetings, thoth.

136
00:08:42,223 --> 00:08:44,390
你沒有想到自己的學生
Did you ever imagine that your former student

137
00:08:44,392 --> 00:08:45,224
某天居然當上國王了吧 ?
would one day wear the crown of Egypt?

138
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,296
荷魯斯的人格
Horus evinced a range of attributes,

139
00:08:50,298 --> 00:08:52,364
和領袖位置有很強的契合度
some of which may well correlate with a leadership position.

140
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,233
如果他夠幸運的話
If he's lucky.

141
00:08:56,971 --> 00:09:00,239
讚美奧西奡 !
Praise osiris!

142
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,578
全埃及之王 !
King of all Egypt!

143
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,549
拉主神 光之主萬歲 (Ra 主神/太陽神)
Hail ra, lord of light.

144
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:13,152
拉主神 光之主萬歲 (Ra 主神/太陽神)
Hail ra, lord of light!

145
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:17,122
我父親祝福著今日
My father has seen fit to bless this day

146
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,527
就如你們用慷慨祝福我們一樣
as you all bless us with your generosity.

147
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,935
這是一個富人的禮物
A token from someone with much.

148
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:33,272
而這是一個窮人的禮物
And from someone with little.

149
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:38,010
但當他們最終站在來世之門面前
But when both die and stand at the final gate,

150
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:41,280
到時候這禮物有多少價值 ?
what is their value then?

151
00:09:41,282 --> 00:09:43,449
要我說價值是平等的
I say they are equal.

152
00:09:43,451 --> 00:09:45,985
都是他們好好活過的證明
Symbols of lives well-lived.

153
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:50,289
來世歡迎所有人
All are welcome to the afterlife.

154
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:53,292
這是我的遺產
This is my legacy.

155
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:58,564
但今天 我們要為新國王加冕
But today, we crown a new king.

156
00:09:58,566 --> 00:10:01,533
而以後某日 他也會擁有自己的遺產
And one day, he will have a legacy of his own.

157
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:04,970
我的兒子荷魯斯 天空神
My son horus, lord of the air.

158
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,085
準備好了沒 ?
Are you ready?

159
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:21,954
好了
I am.

160
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:28,227
等等
Wait!

161
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,229
等等
Wait.

162
00:10:30,231 --> 00:10:32,298
抱歉來遲了
Sorry I'm late.

163
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,234
額 穿越沙漠花了3天
Ugh, three days to cross the desert.

164
00:10:35,236 --> 00:10:37,670
而穿過你的信徒們也差點花了1天
And nearly one more to pass through all your admirers.

165
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,140
賽特
Set!

166
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:43,008
哥哥 真高興見到你
Brother. Good to see you.

167
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,977
我也是 弟弟
And you, brother.

168
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:46,178
這堛漱j門永遠向你敞開
There's always a place for you here.

169
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,049
今天對家族來說是個大日子 你肯定很驕傲
Such a big day for the family. You must be proud.

170
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:52,584
確實
I am.

171
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:55,688
瞧瞧你啊 侄子 真是華麗
Look at you, nephew. Magnificent.

172
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,688
至少這堨H後還是有個好國王的
At least someone here'll make a fine king.

173
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:58,958
我怕你不來了呢
I was afraid you wouldn't come.

174
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,292
不 我絕不會錯過的
No, I wouldn't miss it.

175
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:01,226
啊
Ah.

176
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:03,696
- 給你的  - 噢...
For you. Oh...

177
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:08,634
獵號
A hunting horn.

178
00:11:08,636 --> 00:11:11,603
這只巨羊在遇上我之前打敗了10位神
From the skull of a ram that flattened 10 gods slower than me.

179
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:13,038
真精美
It's beautiful.

180
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,373
是嗎 ?  試試吧
Yeah? Try it out.

181
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,279
賽特送的
From set.

182
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:25,184
來吧 讓主神聽聽你的呼喊吧
Come on! Let ra himself hear you.

183
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:39,064
看來的確有人聽到了
I think someone heard you.

184
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:04,522
你這是什麼意思 賽特 ?
What is this, set?

185
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:16,435
認出來了嗎 ?
You recognize it?

186
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,707
這是父親給你的
Father gave it to you.

187
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,046
在沙漠夜晚保護了我很多次
Kept me alive for many a night in the desert.

188
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,617
和我打一場
Fight me.

189
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:33,052
- 父親 別  - 你別管 兒子
Father, don't. Stay out of this, son.

190
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,188
為什麼 ?
Why?

191
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:40,426
和平了1000年 你又完成了什麼事業 ?
In 1,000 years of peace, what have you accomplished?

192
00:12:40,428 --> 00:12:43,662
一群毫無夢想的人
A land of people who dream of nothing more.

193
00:12:43,664 --> 00:12:44,830
該我當國王了
It's my turn now.

194
00:12:44,832 --> 00:12:47,366
我不會和你戰鬥的
I won't fight.

195
00:12:47,368 --> 00:12:49,268
我愛你 弟弟 打心底媟R著
I love you, brother. With all my heart.

196
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,506
不 !
No!

197
00:12:54,508 --> 00:12:55,474
我也愛你 哥哥
I love you, too, brother.

198
00:12:58,078 --> 00:12:58,811
不 !
No!

199
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:01,346
奧西奡 !
Osiris!

200
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:10,122
看來今天確實是家族的大日子
Well, this truly is a big day for the family.

201
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,358
我 斯特
I, set,

202
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,296
將成為你們真正的國王
shall be your one true king.

203
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:21,233
全埃及之王 !
King of all Egypt!

204
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:23,836
這就是阻擾我的下場
Behold the fate of those who stand in my way.

205
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,271
眾神們...
Gods...

206
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,442
臣服於我 否則去死
Bow before me or die.

207
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:38,650
凡人們 敬拜我 否則就當奴隸 !
Mortals, worship me or be enslaved!

208
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,592
貝克
Bek!

209
00:13:46,594 --> 00:13:49,394
我哥哥認為來世是一份禮物
My brother thought the afterlife was a gift.

210
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:53,398
而我覺得作為國王應該更有追求才對
I think a king should have higher standards.

211
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,902
從現在起 想進入來世
From now on, you have to buy your way in

212
00:13:56,904 --> 00:13:57,769
必須交貢
with riches earned.

213
00:14:03,511 --> 00:14:06,145
你的旅程才剛剛開始
Your journey has just begun.

214
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,363
送給你了
It's yours now.

215
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,267
我們很多人會支援你 但現在不是戰鬥的時候
Many of us will stand with you, but now is not the time.

216
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,774
- 我曾經很敬仰你  - 廢話
I looked up to you. Of course you did.

217
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:39,845
你這樣就太愚蠢了
That would be unwise.

218
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:47,819
聽說你從不失手 ?
Is it true you still never miss?

219
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:48,820
難道你不覺得無聊麼 ?
Doesn't that get dull?

220
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:55,427
不是說你擁有完美的視力麼
I thought your sight was perfect.

221
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:22,588
你打得不錯
You fight well.

222
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:24,890
你確定你是他親兒子 ?
Are you so sure you're his son?

223
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,417
薩亞 !
Zaya!

224
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:28,420
- 貝克  - 薩亞 !
Bek! Zaya!

225
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:29,988
貝克 !
Bek!

226
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,089
我這是為埃及好 你不適合當國王
I'm doing Egypt a favor. You're not fit to be king.

227
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,537
不 !
No!

228
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:19,471
不 !
No!

229
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:37,889
賽特 !
Set!

230
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:55,807
原諒我 父親
Forgive me, father.

231
00:18:03,717 --> 00:18:04,616
薩亞 !
Zaya!

232
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,051
薩亞 !
Zaya!

233
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,995
賽特當上了國王
And so set was king.

234
00:18:16,997 --> 00:18:20,632
多年來 很多神明們都反抗過他
In the year that followed, many gods stood against him.

235
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:24,603
一個接一個 都付出了生命的代價
One by one, they paid with their lives.

236
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:26,805
至於凡人 情況更加不幸
For mortals, things were worse.

237
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:30,108
大部分人都被強迫成了奴隸
Most were forced into slavery,

238
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,144
而根本不給工錢
and denied even the tiniest penny

239
00:18:32,146 --> 00:18:35,414
買不起貢品進入來世
to buy our way into the afterlife.

240
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:39,451
被打敗後挖出雙眼 荷魯斯被放逐出境
Blinded and defeated, horus withdrew into exile.

241
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:41,520
那些祈禱他回來拯救埃及的人
Those who prayed for him to save Egypt

242
00:18:41,522 --> 00:18:42,687
只迎來了失望
were sorely disappointed.

243
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:46,825
但我從來不怎麼喜歡祈禱
But I was never much for prayer.

244
00:18:46,827 --> 00:18:49,094
我發現薩亞被賣給了一個暴主
I had found zaya enslaved to a cruel master.

245
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:53,999
但我怎麼拯救她呢 ?
But how could I free her from all this?

246
00:18:54,001 --> 00:18:56,067
這是我最瘋狂的計劃
It was the maddest of all plans.

247
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,049
你或許控制不了風 薩亞
You may not control the wind, zaya,

248
00:19:11,051 --> 00:19:12,584
但我覺得你還是能把窗戶關上的
but I'd think you could close a shutter.

249
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,553
抱歉 大人
Sorry, my lord.

250
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:21,059
漂亮小妞 如果我的桌子再這麼凌亂
Pretty one, if ever I find my desk disordered again,

251
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:22,894
我就派你出去推石頭
I'll throw you outside to push stone.

252
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:23,728
明白沒 ?
Is that clear?

253
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,136
快走 我時間可不多
Come on, come on! Haven't got all day.

254
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,977
我真想把他從高處推下去
I'd like to drop him from a great height.

255
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:40,779
早安
Morning.

256
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:44,816
總有一日 我會把你從他身邊偷走
One day, I'm going to steal you away from him.

257
00:19:44,818 --> 00:19:46,816
難道你只會玩偷竊行徑嗎 ?
Is theft always the answer?

258
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:48,854
現在這個世界只能靠偷了 要麼富有 要麼豬狗不如
It is now in this world. You're either rich or nothing.

259
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,624
就算你能救我出去
Even if you could free me,

260
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:54,860
那我家人怎麼辦 ? 還有我們的朋友
what about my family? Our friends?

261
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:57,095
你能從賽特手中偷走整個埃及嗎 ?
Can you steal all Egypt away from set?

262
00:19:57,097 --> 00:19:59,531
只有荷魯斯能拯救我們
Only horus can free us.

263
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:00,932
你真覺得眾神們在乎嗎 ?
You really believe the gods care?

264
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:02,567
如果荷魯斯能回來 他就在乎
If horus could come, he would.

265
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,169
我想讓你看點東西
I want to show you something.

266
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:15,780
賽特的軍隊帶著戰利品回來了
Set's army returns with spoils of war.

267
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:17,282
他的寶庫今晚會開啟
His vault will be unlocked tonight.

268
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:18,783
這是一個
The perfect time

269
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:19,918
潛入的完美時機
for someone to sneak inside.

270
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,853
為什麼 ?
Why?

271
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:23,788
人們說荷魯斯的眼睛被保管在堶
They say horus' eyes are kept there.

272
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,190
有了眼睛就能找回力量
He would have his power again.

273
00:20:25,192 --> 00:20:26,625
從神手中偷東西 ?
Steal from a god?

274
00:20:26,627 --> 00:20:29,194
只有瘋子才會這樣做
Only a madman would try such a thing.

275
00:20:29,196 --> 00:20:31,029
那你覺得我們上哪去找這樣一個瘋子 ?
Where do you suppose we could find someone so mad?

276
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:34,799
圖紙應該就在這
The plans should be here.

277
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:35,967
寶庫是烏許建的 他是賽特的建築師
Urshu built the vault. He's set's architect.

278
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:38,703
這是啥 ?
What's this?

279
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:41,771
賽特的沙築金字塔
Uh, set's pyramid of sand.

280
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:45,277
他還建造了個巨大的火山坑
He's built himself quite the fire pit.

281
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,312
他肯定烤過很多山珍佳餚
He must cook massive feasts.

282
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:49,548
那火山坑是通往世界的中心的
It's the pit to the center of the world.

283
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,650
那堿O他力量的來源 不是用來烤肉的
The source of his power. No feasts.

284
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:53,785
找到了
Found it.

285
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:58,089
寶物會從前門通過
The treasure will pass through the front gate.

286
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,257
前門不是什麼問題
The front gate isn't the problem.

287
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,092
接下來才是
It's what comes after.

288
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:03,061
兩座充滿陷阱的大橋
Two Bridges rigged with traps.

289
00:21:03,063 --> 00:21:04,129
烏許還經常以此自誇
Urshu boasts of them endlessly.

290
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,264
好在我擅長作弊
Good thing I'm cheating.

291
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:23,314
要拜訪我就好好拜訪 士兵
Welcome me properly, soldier.

292
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,951
別讓埃及女王等久了
Don't keep the queen of Egypt waiting.

293
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:43,768
我覺得你想我了
I think you missed me.

294
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,104
我必須想你才行
I have to miss you.

295
00:21:46,106 --> 00:21:47,772
我畢竟是你的俘虜
I'm your prisoner, after all.

296
00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:49,608
那這座監獄還不賴嘛
Oh, this prison's not so bad.

297
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,842
可我很不開心
Well, I'm miserable.

298
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:53,378
你都是這樣表達不開心的嗎
You have a funny way of showing it.

299
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,915
我能借用你的刀嗎 ?
Can I borrow your knife?

300
00:21:56,917 --> 00:22:00,819
好讓你有機會殺了我 ?
So if you had the chance, you'd kill me?

301
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:02,821
我怎麼殺得了你 ?
How could I kill you?

302
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:05,824
但你有機會就會下手
But you would if you could.

303
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:08,860
那你最好堤防下我了
Better keep your eyes open.

304
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,205
賽特大人
Lord set.

305
00:22:21,207 --> 00:22:22,674
噢...
Oh...

306
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:24,075
以及... 女士
And, uh... mistress.

307
00:22:25,378 --> 00:22:27,679
或許我該另找時間拜訪
Perhaps I might come at a better time.

308
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:29,247
不用 進來吧 別害羞
No, come in. Don't be shy.

309
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,219
過來吧
Come on.

310
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:46,364
從沒有人為拉主神建造過這樣巨大的雕像
No one has ever so honored the great god ra.

311
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:48,967
他的神跡將會流芳百代
He will pass over its peak and marvel

312
00:22:48,969 --> 00:22:50,368
以及您為他做出的貢獻
at the tribute you have built in his name.

313
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:52,837
僅此而已 ?
Is that it?

314
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:54,939
抱歉 ?
I'm sorry?

315
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,409
能建得更高點麼 ?
Well, can you make it any taller?

316
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,845
更高 ?
Taller?

317
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:03,782
沒錯 這問題很簡單的
Yes, it's a simple question.

318
00:23:03,784 --> 00:23:05,216
額 有可能會有點困難
Well, that might be difficult, um,

319
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,919
我指的是...
now, I mean...

320
00:23:07,921 --> 00:23:09,854
放鬆點 烏許 我開玩笑的
Relax, urshu. I'm joking.

321
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:14,225
告訴我
Tell me,

322
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:18,430
為什麼你父親選擇你來當主建築師
why'd your father choose you to be master builder

323
00:23:18,432 --> 00:23:20,932
而不是你那幾個兄弟 ?
rather than one of your brothers?

324
00:23:20,934 --> 00:23:23,101
我估計應該是我證明了自己是最優秀的 大人
I suppose because I proved to be the best, my lord.

325
00:23:23,103 --> 00:23:25,370
就如同我也會證明我是父親最優秀的兒子
As I shall prove to be the best to my father.

326
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:31,009
他將見證我為他做的一切
He shall see it from dawn to dusk.

327
00:23:31,011 --> 00:23:32,410
您的滿意比金子更重要
Your satisfaction is worth more than gold.

328
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,979
金子 金子
Oh, gold, gold!

329
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:36,915
你進入來世之後肯定有著花不完的金子
You'll have plenty enough gold for the afterlife.

330
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:37,782
乾杯 !
A toast!

331
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:40,852
敬埃及最優秀的建築師
To Egypt's greatest builder.

332
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:45,757
敬我的遺產
A toast to my legacy.

333
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:43,982
喔 !
Whoa!

334
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:07,872
你上哪找的這麼多蝎子啊 ?
Where do you even get that many scorpions?

335
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:45,510
看來得小心自己的影子了
Enough to make you afraid of your own shadow.

336
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:17,375
"圓環是機關"
"The circle is the trigger."

337
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:21,446
那我就繞開走
So I'll go 'round.

338
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:27,585
還挺簡單的
Well, that was easy.

339
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:05,323
第三座橋
A third bridge.

340
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:10,662
上面可沒寫什麼第三座橋啊
Doesn't say anything about a third bridge.

341
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:13,932
簡直作弊
This is criminal.

342
00:27:15,668 --> 00:27:17,201
而且只有一隻眼
And only one eye.

343
00:27:21,674 --> 00:27:23,675
這下好了
Terrific.

344
00:27:23,677 --> 00:27:27,111
薩亞 為我祈禱吧
Zaya, you'd say a prayer, I'll roll the bones.

345
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:08,419
薩亞 !
Zaya!

346
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:11,689
真對不起
I'm so sorry.

347
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:18,463
用我的房子來通姦還不夠是嗎...
As if using my house for your fornicating were not sufficient...

348
00:28:23,736 --> 00:28:25,169
你居然敢偷國王的東西
You dare steal from the king?

349
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:35,013
我希望自己的辦公室調理有序 薩亞
I pride myself in an orderly office, zaya.

350
00:28:36,482 --> 00:28:39,417
可你從不明白這一點 對吧 ?
You never did understand that, did you?

351
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:41,552
還有你這可悲的小掛件
Oh, and this pathetic little trinket of yours

352
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:43,721
恐怕救你們內中一人都不夠
will save neither of you, I'm afraid.

353
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:45,089
賽特是你的神明
Set is your god.

354
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:46,457
- 這都是我的主意  - 騙子 !
It was all my idea. Liar!

355
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:54,065
把你偷的東西交出來
Give me back what you took.

356
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,040
謝謝
Thank you.

357
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:06,077
- 把他們拉出去餵財狼  - 等等 !
Feed them to the jackals. Wait!

358
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:11,215
我還拿了另外的東西
I took something else.

359
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:17,755
快跑 !
Run!

360
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:38,443
- 你成功了  - 另一隻在哪 ?
You did it. Where's the other?

361
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:41,646
你知道偷一隻有多難嗎 ?
You know how hard it was to steal that one?

362
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:02,300
我會永遠愛你
I'll love you forever.

363
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:04,168
薩亞
Zaya.

364
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,536
死亡並不是終結
Death is not the end.

365
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:06,838
薩亞
Zaya.

366
00:30:23,256 --> 00:30:24,188
喔
Whoa.

367
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:32,330
我會救你的 薩亞
I'll make it right, zaya.

368
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,908
我不需要信徒
I don't need any more worshippers.

369
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,778
也不需要你們惡臭的貢品
Tributes that rot and stink.

370
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:24,515
除非你有酒 否則滾出去
Unless you brought more wine, get out.

371
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:26,851
我不是信徒
I'm no worshipper.

372
00:31:28,187 --> 00:31:29,754
那你是什麼 ? 小偷 ?
What are you? Some thief?

373
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:32,590
沒錯 小偷
Yes. A thief.

374
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:35,793
我手上有賽特從你那奪走的東西
I have something set took from you.

375
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:47,838
沒有凡人能盜竊賽特的寶庫
No mortal could rob set's vault.

376
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:51,509
這是你殺害我的信徒搶去的
You pilfered one of my followers' corpses.

377
00:31:51,511 --> 00:31:53,277
他們根本沒發現我
They never even got close.

378
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:54,445
交出來
Give them to me.

379
00:31:55,214 --> 00:31:56,480
還不行
Not yet.

380
00:31:56,482 --> 00:31:57,949
把雙眼還給我
Give me my eyes.

381
00:31:57,951 --> 00:31:59,517
我有項提議
I have a proposition.

382
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,518
你居然敢和我討價還價 ?
You bargain with me?

383
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:11,662
你很幸運 我願意和你討價
You're lucky I'm willing to.

384
00:32:11,664 --> 00:32:12,897
就你這樣子連大象都打不到
You can't strike a three-legged elephant.

385
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:16,767
你是想要回報吧 ? 金子 ?
You want a reward, I suppose? Gold?

386
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:17,501
我自己能偷金子
Gold I can steal.

387
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,291
有個我想救的人 ?
There's someone I want saved.

388
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:44,962
從哪救 ?
From what?

389
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:47,665
死亡
Death.

390
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:51,035
你父親不是教過你死亡不是終結嗎 ?
Didn't your father teach that death isn't the end?

391
00:32:51,037 --> 00:32:53,704
這是不可能的
It can't be done.

392
00:32:53,706 --> 00:32:56,374
那你想辦法啊 你可是荷魯斯 天空之神
Well, figure it out. You're horus, lord of the air!

393
00:32:56,376 --> 00:32:57,942
要不然我就把手上的東西丟進尼羅河
Or maybe I'll just toss what I have in the nile.

394
00:32:57,944 --> 00:32:58,843
等等
Wait.

395
00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:10,955
待在人世
Stay with the living.

396
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,391
待在人世
Stay with the living.

397
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:15,693
待在人世
Stay with the living.

398
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,899
- 她已經去到了我觸碰不了的地方  - 但你是神啊
She's gone beyond where I can reach her. But you're a god.

399
00:33:21,901 --> 00:33:23,934
眾神們可以活上1000年
Gods may live 1,000 of your years,

400
00:33:23,936 --> 00:33:25,436
但我們治癒不了死亡
but we cannot cure mortality.

401
00:33:26,972 --> 00:33:28,839
該送她走上冥路了
It's time for her to walk the path.

402
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:29,907
你一定有辦法的
There must be something you can do.

403
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:30,908
我已經盡我所能了
I've done all I can.

404
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:35,846
永恆之神啊
Oh, thou who art everlasting,

405
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:37,615
派你的僕人前來引領死者前往新生吧
send your servant to guide the dead to new life.

406
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:45,623
阿努比斯 現身吧
Anubis, come forth.

407
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:00,671
你自由了
You are released.

408
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:12,750
地心之門已向你敞開
The doors of earth are open to you.

409
00:34:12,752 --> 00:34:14,919
你得踏上旅途了
You must begin your journey.

410
00:34:14,921 --> 00:34:16,687
她死時是一名奴隸
She died a slave.

411
00:34:16,689 --> 00:34:17,788
沒有財寶的話 她絕對
Without treasure, she won't be allowed

412
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:18,656
通不過來世之門的
through the final gate.

413
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:21,425
你有什麼籌碼 ?
What do you offer?

414
00:34:21,427 --> 00:34:22,860
她進不去來世的
She can't pass into the afterlife.

415
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:26,864
阿努比斯大人
For you, lord Anubis,

416
00:34:26,866 --> 00:34:28,632
主建築師住在高高的大山上
governor of the bows, who is upon his mountain,

417
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,104
而我卻只有微笑能給你
I have only my smile.

418
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:35,673
如你所願
So be it.

419
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:40,044
薩亞 !
Zaya!

420
00:34:41,113 --> 00:34:42,847
薩亞 !
Zaya!

421
00:34:42,849 --> 00:34:43,814
死人是不會對活人說話的
The dead don't speak to the living.

422
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:58,129
待在主路上
Stay on the path.

423
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,840
現在給我吧
Now give them to me.

424
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:14,044
- 你根本就沒幫上忙 !  - 我的眼睛
You've done nothing! My eyes.

425
00:35:14,046 --> 00:35:16,447
你今後就一直盲目亂竄吧
Spend the rest of your days wandering around sightless.

426
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:17,481
我已經什麼都沒了 你明白嗎 ?
I have nothing to lose. Do you understand?

427
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:19,817
把眼睛給我
Give me my eyes.

428
00:35:19,819 --> 00:35:20,751
我為了見她 願意做任何事 我寧願拚死一搏
I will do anything to see her again or I'll die trying.

429
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:24,121
你想躲過我的話 就少說點話
You want to hide from me? Learn to talk less.

430
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:28,793
給
Here.

431
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:40,771
另一隻呢 ?
Where's the other?

432
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,543
另一隻在哪 ?
Where's the other?

433
00:35:45,545 --> 00:35:47,211
我也不確定 不過我...
Well, I'm not exactly sure, but I...

434
00:35:47,213 --> 00:35:48,746
我扭斷你的脖子
I'll snap your neck.

435
00:35:50,216 --> 00:35:51,549
你一定很恨賽特殺了你父親
You must hate set for what he did to your father.

436
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:57,988
金字塔
The pyramid.

437
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,490
我知道怎麼進入金字塔
I know how to get into set's pyramid.

438
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:01,592
說說看
How?

439
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:03,894
快說
How?

440
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:06,564
噢...
Oh...

441
00:36:09,635 --> 00:36:11,535
那是他的力量之源 對吧 ?
It's where he keeps his power locked up, right?

442
00:36:11,537 --> 00:36:13,871
如果我幫你潛入進去 你能殺了他麼 ?
If I could get you inside, could you kill him?

443
00:36:17,976 --> 00:36:18,776
怎麼進去 ?
How would you do that?

444
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:21,212
我看了建築圖
I saw the plans.

445
00:36:21,214 --> 00:36:22,746
給我說說
Tell me.

446
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:23,848
- 我直接帶你去  - 繼續
I'll show you. Go on.

447
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:24,682
如果你把薩亞帶回來
If you bring zaya back.

448
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,920
或許是有個方法
There may be a way.

449
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:34,992
進入了來世的人就無法回頭
No one may leave the afterlife once entered.

450
00:36:34,994 --> 00:36:36,560
但是要穿過九大門
But the journey through the nine gates

451
00:36:36,562 --> 00:36:37,661
需要好多天才行
will take several days to complete.

452
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:41,532
而只有國王才能讓阿努比斯回頭
And only the king can make Anubis turn back.

453
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:46,070
如果我趕在你的愛人到達來世之門面前
If I kill set and take back the crown

454
00:36:46,072 --> 00:36:47,938
殺死賽特 並且奪回王冠的話
before your beloved reaches the final gate,

455
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:50,541
我或許能救她回來
I might be able to save her.

456
00:36:58,650 --> 00:36:59,283
努力跟上
Try to keep up.

457
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:08,259
我的勇猛獵犬們
My magnificent bloody hounds.

458
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:14,565
你們是真正的埃及之子
You are the true sons of Egypt.

459
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:16,133
你們是我的鐵與血子
You are my children of iron and blood.

460
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:19,637
我真是為你們驕傲
No father could be more proud.

461
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,274
叛亂的眾神們已經被我們討伐
The rebel gods have choked on our Spears.

462
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:27,311
剩下的都逃進了奈芙蒂斯的要塞
The rest have retreated to nephthys' stronghold

463
00:37:27,313 --> 00:37:30,114
他們在那做好了準備抵抗我們
where they now stand ready to face us.

464
00:37:30,116 --> 00:37:33,017
但你們 我的沙漠軍團
But you, my legions of the desert,

465
00:37:33,019 --> 00:37:35,052
將讓他們一敗塗地 !
will bring them reckoning!

466
00:37:38,323 --> 00:37:39,823
拿上你們的金子吧 !
So take your fill of gold!

467
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:44,628
如果你們戰死沙場
And if you should fall in battle

468
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,163
踏上了九門旅途
and travel the nine gates,

469
00:37:46,165 --> 00:37:49,166
告訴我哥哥你們崇拜的是誰 !
tell my brother who it is you worship!

470
00:37:49,168 --> 00:37:51,702
賽特軍隊 稍息 立正 !
Division set! Amarn! Ta! Rai!

471
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,070
排好隊 !
Fall in!

472
00:37:54,306 --> 00:37:56,307
先前進軍 !
Forward march!

473
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:08,919
大人
My lord.

474
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,924
你的皇家寶庫被人入侵了
Your royal treasury has been breached.

475
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:18,829
烏許...
Urshu...

476
00:38:18,831 --> 00:38:19,656
那隻眼的作用
Wasn't the eye meant to

477
00:38:19,657 --> 00:38:21,165
難道不是用來引誘荷魯斯的忠臣們自投羅網的嗎 ?
lure those loyal to horus to their deaths?

478
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:23,067
是的 大人
Yes, lord.

479
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:25,736
而你的陷阱...
And weren't your traps...

480
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:28,672
你當時是怎麼說的 ?
What was the term you used?

481
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:30,641
防盜 ?
Thief-proof?

482
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:32,776
是的 大人
Yes, lord.

483
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:35,112
你能追蹤到麼 ?
Can you pick up the trail?

484
00:38:35,114 --> 00:38:36,747
我會找到他的
I'll find him.

485
00:38:36,749 --> 00:38:38,115
把幫他的那個小偷
And find whichever of his allies

486
00:38:38,117 --> 00:38:40,651
也給我找出來
was clever enough to steal back his eye.

487
00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:45,689
他是個凡人 大人
It was a mortal, lord.

488
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,859
凡人 ?
A mortal?

489
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:57,334
她是誰 ?
Who is she?

490
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:58,902
他的僕人
His servant.

491
00:38:58,904 --> 00:39:00,838
我為自己說一句 大人...
In my defense, lord...

492
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,741
相信我 我很好奇你的借口是什麼
Believe me, I'm very curious to hear what your excuse is.

493
00:39:03,743 --> 00:39:04,975
但是現在不是時候
But not right now.

494
00:39:04,977 --> 00:39:05,843
遵命 大人
Yes, lord.

495
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:12,049
看來你不是
Well, it appears you're not

496
00:39:12,051 --> 00:39:13,751
埃及最聰明的凡人
the cleverest mortal in Egypt after all.

497
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:15,719
這個小偷才是
This thief is.

498
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,357
你的計劃是什麼 ?
So what is your plan?

499
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:22,292
想要殺死沙漠之神
To kill the god of the desert,

500
00:39:22,294 --> 00:39:22,993
我們必須先殺死沙漠
we must kill the desert itself.

501
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:25,396
殺死沙漠 ?
Kill the desert?

502
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:27,998
沙漠怎麼殺 ?
How do you kill the desert?

503
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,440
我們得去我爺爺那
We must go to my grandfather's.

504
00:39:36,442 --> 00:39:37,441
他會幫我們的
He'll help us with our task.

505
00:39:37,443 --> 00:39:39,410
你爺爺 ?
Your grandfather?

506
00:39:39,412 --> 00:39:40,778
你指的是拉 ? 太陽神拉 ?
You mean ra? The sun god ra?

507
00:39:42,914 --> 00:39:43,747
那你爺爺在哪 ?
So where exactly is your grandfather?

508
00:39:48,253 --> 00:39:50,020
你開玩笑的 對吧 ?
You're being funny, right?

509
00:39:50,022 --> 00:39:51,789
你以為我有心情開玩笑 ?
You think I'd put any effort into trying to amuse you?

510
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:55,125
看來飛行能力在現在很有用
It seems flying would be useful right now.

511
00:39:55,127 --> 00:39:57,094
我沒有兩隻眼就變不了身
Without both my eyes, I cannot transform.

512
00:39:57,096 --> 00:39:58,062
我得為了力量祈禱才行
I need to pray for strength.

513
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:01,063
你這話一點都不鼓舞人心
Oh, that's not encouraging.

514
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,966
安靜點 否則我丟你下山去
Be silent or you'll reach the bottom of this mountain

515
00:40:02,968 --> 00:40:04,201
下山速度可比上山快多了
much quicker than you reached the top.

516
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:25,923
偉大的拉神 傾聽我的呼喚
Great ra, know my name.

517
00:40:27,325 --> 00:40:28,792
天空神請求你的懷抱
The lord of the air seeks your embrace.

518
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,001
爺爺 我需要你幫忙 拜託了 !
Grandfather, I need your help. Please!

519
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:54,418
真厲害 !
Impressed!

520
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:29,086
待在我的影子
Stay in my shadow.

521
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:31,922
- 為啥 ?  - 照我說的做就是
Why? Just do as I say.

522
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,426
偉大的拉主神萬歲
Hail, thou great god ra.

523
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:40,430
通常來說 當一隻鳥上了我的船
Normally, when a bird lands on my boat,

524
00:41:40,432 --> 00:41:41,799
我會趕在它拉屎前就殺了它
I kill it before it can shit.

525
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,502
你這是什麼意思 ?
What is this?

526
00:41:45,504 --> 00:41:47,971
你居然敢帶一個凡人來到萬物之源
You dare bring a mortal to the source of creation?

527
00:41:47,973 --> 00:41:50,207
他對我很重要 我不能丟下他
He's valuable to me. I could not leave him behind.

528
00:41:50,209 --> 00:41:53,944
啊 那你來做什麼 ?
Ah. Why have you come?

529
00:41:53,946 --> 00:41:55,345
我想請您幫忙
I would only ask something of you.

530
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:56,880
既然是這樣的話
Oh, in that case,

531
00:41:56,882 --> 00:42:00,951
那我還是停下手中的事 好好聽聽你的請求吧
I shall stop what I'm doing and heed your bidding.

532
00:42:00,953 --> 00:42:02,186
爺爺 抱歉 我沒想要冒犯您
Grandfather, I'm sorry. I mean no disrespect.

533
00:42:02,188 --> 00:42:04,354
你已經冒犯了
You don't know the difference.

534
00:42:09,928 --> 00:42:11,528
待在這 保持安靜
Stay there. Be quiet.

535
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,165
我有活要做了
I have work to do.

536
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:35,552
如果你想要這凡人活命 就讓他去下甲板
And put the mortal below deck if you want him to live.

537
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,670
爬回你的陰影堨h 你這臭蟲 !
Crawl back to shadow, you stinking worm!

538
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:04,274
休想吃我創造的東西 !
You shall never feast on my creation!

539
00:44:06,277 --> 00:44:08,078
盡量放馬過來吧
Try as you might.

540
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:14,084
如果我和你們住在
Things would be different if I could dwell

541
00:44:14,086 --> 00:44:16,520
尼羅河花園 這個世界就完蛋了
amongst my children in the garden of the nile.

542
00:44:16,522 --> 00:44:19,089
對抗惡魔阿波菲斯(冥府之蛇)是我的責任
It is my burden to fight the demon apophis

543
00:44:19,091 --> 00:44:20,524
它每晚都要來
night after night.

544
00:44:20,526 --> 00:44:22,559
埃及決不能被混亂毀滅
Egypt must never be destroyed by chaos.

545
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,495
看到了吧
So, you see,

546
00:44:25,497 --> 00:44:27,431
有東西比賽特更可怕
there are things worse than set.

547
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:30,267
您錯了
You're wrong.

548
00:44:30,269 --> 00:44:32,302
那只惡魔可沒有殺害我父親
That demon isn't the one who murdered my father.

549
00:44:32,304 --> 00:44:33,403
也就是您兒子
Murdered your son.

550
00:44:33,405 --> 00:44:36,239
他倆都是我兒子
They are both my sons.

551
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:37,641
他們在我眼堻ㄛO平等的
They were both equal in my eyes.

552
00:44:37,643 --> 00:44:39,276
和我所有的創造物都一樣
As is all of my creation.

553
00:44:39,278 --> 00:44:41,979
而命運的不確定性是我的意志
And the uncertainty of its destiny is my will.

554
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:52,456
你到底是來做什麼的 ?
So what is it actually that brings you here?

555
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,759
請讓我用神水灌滿水壺
Allow me to fill my flask with these waters.

556
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:01,598
神水又不是我的
The waters are not mine.

557
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,360
你想澆滅沙漠之火
You plan to quench the desert fire.

558
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:34,064
殺死賽特 成為國王
To kill set. To become king

559
00:45:34,066 --> 00:45:35,565
遵從你父親的意願
as your father wished.

560
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:37,334
賜予我再次飛翔的力量
Grant me the power to fly again.

561
00:45:37,336 --> 00:45:39,669
剛剛我就聽見你的祈禱了
I heard your prayer the first time.

562
00:45:39,671 --> 00:45:41,071
我讓你來到了這
I let you come here

563
00:45:41,073 --> 00:45:42,339
還允許你回去
and I Grant you passage home.

564
00:45:42,341 --> 00:45:44,541
但在此之後呢 ?
But after that?

565
00:45:44,543 --> 00:45:46,743
沒了雙眼
Without both my eyes,

566
00:45:46,745 --> 00:45:48,578
我怕我的力量不夠擊敗賽特
I doubt I'm strong enough to beat set.

567
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:49,780
那就去磨煉
So become stronger.

568
00:45:51,182 --> 00:45:53,383
難道你懶惰太久了
Have you been so lazy for so long

569
00:45:53,385 --> 00:45:56,453
都忘了每一位神的生命都是一段旅程 ?
that you've forgotten every god's life is a journey?

570
00:45:56,455 --> 00:45:59,756
當你誤入歧途時 你就會變弱
When you stray from your path, you grow weak.

571
00:45:59,758 --> 00:46:00,791
喂 !
Hey!

572
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:05,328
你為什麼要讓這凡人待在你身邊 ?
Why are you lugging around this mortal?

573
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:06,563
他有膽量和我討價還價
He had the gall to strike a bargain with me.

574
00:46:07,398 --> 00:46:09,499
啊
Ah.

575
00:46:09,501 --> 00:46:12,335
反正帶著他也不會減你威風 是吧 ?
Not worth the papyrus it's written on, hmm?

576
00:46:12,337 --> 00:46:14,404
重要嗎 ? 他只是一介凡人
What does it matter? He is but a mortal.

577
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:27,484
我不贊成賽特的統治
I do not approve of how set rules.

578
00:46:27,486 --> 00:46:29,453
但我也不確定你比他好
But I'm uncertain you would be much better.

579
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:45,669
大人 最後一群叛亂眾神
Lord, the last of the rebel gods

580
00:46:45,671 --> 00:46:47,204
也逃進了她的要塞
have retreated behind her walls.

581
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:49,272
所有人都進去了 ?
Every last one?

582
00:46:49,841 --> 00:46:51,842
是的 大人
Yes, sir.

583
00:46:51,844 --> 00:46:53,877
很好 他們成了甕中之鱉
Good. Then they're ripe for the picking.

584
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,180
這樣會不會太過了 ?
Isn't this a bit excessive?

585
00:46:58,516 --> 00:47:00,217
反正她也希望他們奮戰致死
She'd want them to fight to the death anyway.

586
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:03,153
她可是你前妻
She was your wife.

587
00:47:03,155 --> 00:47:04,754
那更有理由殺死她了
All the more reason to kill her.

588
00:47:06,257 --> 00:47:07,757
從現在開始
From now on,

589
00:47:07,759 --> 00:47:09,126
世界就得這麼走
this will be the way of things.

590
00:47:09,861 --> 00:47:12,162
走我們的路
Our way.

591
00:47:12,164 --> 00:47:13,330
你最好趕緊習慣下
Better get used to it.

592
00:48:11,789 --> 00:48:14,591
作為女神怎麼能幹這種粗活 ?
Is it right that a goddess should perform such labor?

593
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,294
從你當上國王開始
Since you became king,

594
00:48:17,296 --> 00:48:19,863
壽衣的需求量大增
the need for burial shrouds has been great.

595
00:48:21,966 --> 00:48:24,467
你本能成為王后
You could have been a queen.

596
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:25,735
你很清楚我為什麼不能
You should know why I could not.

597
00:48:27,205 --> 00:48:27,938
那我當初向你求婚的時候
Then, when I asked you to marry me,

598
00:48:30,508 --> 00:48:32,209
你為什麼答應了我 ?
why did you say yes?

599
00:48:32,211 --> 00:48:33,977
我還記得當時你在沙漠媢騁
I remember when you rode out of the desert.

600
00:48:35,513 --> 00:48:40,283
勇猛 雄偉 帥氣
Impetuous. Dashing. So handsome.

601
00:48:40,285 --> 00:48:42,452
我忍受著狂風 就為了待在你身邊
I braved those stinging winds just to be at your side.

602
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:45,355
想像著我們一起
And imagined the great deeds

603
00:48:45,357 --> 00:48:45,956
能完成怎樣的偉業
we would accomplish together.

604
00:48:46,824 --> 00:48:48,325
當時並不全是痛苦
It didn't all sting.

605
00:48:50,228 --> 00:48:51,294
有一部分還是很甜蜜的
Some parts were sweet.

606
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:54,864
或許吧
Perhaps.

607
00:48:54,866 --> 00:48:56,700
我現在還在想我們當初能幸福
I still thought we could have been happy.

608
00:48:58,236 --> 00:48:59,869
你有了我就該知足了
I should have been enough to fulfill you.

609
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:05,375
沒有什麼東西能讓我滿足
Nothing can fulfill me.

610
00:49:09,013 --> 00:49:10,947
所以拉神早預見到了
That's why ra was wise

611
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:12,983
所以才不讓你繁殖後代
to ensure you would never have a child.

612
00:49:34,005 --> 00:49:36,539
為什麼 ?
Why?

613
00:49:36,541 --> 00:49:38,642
這個秘密不能讓任何人知道
No one will know, until it's too late.

614
00:50:03,835 --> 00:50:05,468
下一次 飛到地面上
Maybe next time, keep flying

615
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:06,603
再把翅膀收回去
until we're actually on the ground.

616
00:50:06,605 --> 00:50:09,306
拉神賜予的東西 他一定會收回去
What ra gave, he took back.

617
00:50:11,543 --> 00:50:12,475
他不是打算幫你嗎
I thought he was helping you.

618
00:50:12,477 --> 00:50:13,677
我已經拿到目標了
I got what I needed.

619
00:50:15,546 --> 00:50:18,648
尼羅河都無法澆滅賽特的火焰
The whole of the nile cannot quench set's fire.

620
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:20,517
但只需幾滴造物池堛滲咫
But a few drops from the water of creation can.

621
00:50:21,419 --> 00:50:22,786
就能殺死沙漠
Kill the desert.

622
00:50:22,788 --> 00:50:25,588
只要火焰沒了 賽特就會被削弱
With his fire gone, set will be weakened.

623
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:26,856
不堪一擊
Vulnerable.

624
00:50:26,858 --> 00:50:27,891
如果我喝了那水會怎麼樣 ?
What would happen if I drank that?

625
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:33,496
你會精神煥發 然後死亡
You would be refreshed. Then you would die.

626
00:50:33,498 --> 00:50:36,599
這可不對啊 造物之水居然能殺人
It doesn't seem right that the water of creation would kill.

627
00:50:36,601 --> 00:50:38,435
是我會殺你 因為你浪費了我的水
I would kill you. For wasting my water.

628
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,073
這是什麼 ?
What's this?

629
00:50:43,075 --> 00:50:44,574
免得你用雙手
So you don't have to bring me something to drink

630
00:50:44,576 --> 00:50:45,375
捧著水給我喝
cupped in your hands.

631
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,378
我可不是你的奴隸
I'm not your slave.

632
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,713
我父親給我說過
My father taught me

633
00:50:49,715 --> 00:50:52,048
神打凡人是髒了手
it's unworthy of a god to strike a man.

634
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:53,483
那他也該告訴你得挪挪身子
He should have taught you to get off your arse

635
00:50:53,485 --> 00:50:54,484
自己找水喝
and get your own water.

636
00:50:59,857 --> 00:51:00,857
抱歉 父親
Sorry, father.

637
00:51:19,677 --> 00:51:20,944
簡直不能接受了
This is becoming unacceptable.

638
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:28,585
荷魯斯的眼睛在哪 ?
Where is the eye of horus?

639
00:51:29,387 --> 00:51:30,653
就在你身後
Up your behind,

640
00:51:30,655 --> 00:51:31,721
你關羊的地方
alongside the goats you keep up there.

641
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:35,959
荷魯斯的眼睛在哪 ?
Where is the eye of horus?

642
00:51:36,994 --> 00:51:37,861
這
Right here.

643
00:51:40,399 --> 00:51:41,698
我還以為你還盲目的
I thought you were crawling

644
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:42,966
在泥巴堨景u呢
sightless in the mud somewhere.

645
00:51:44,135 --> 00:51:45,535
殺了他 !
Cut him down!

646
00:51:58,116 --> 00:51:59,716
看見沒 兄弟們 ?
See, brothers?

647
00:51:59,718 --> 00:52:01,785
沒有另一隻眼 他十分弱小
Without his other eye, he is weak.

648
00:52:50,968 --> 00:52:53,002
就算我瞎了 聾了
Even if I were blind, deaf,

649
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:55,805
還缺胳膊少腿...
bereft of limbs...

650
00:52:58,843 --> 00:52:59,943
你也不是我的對手
You're still no match for me.

651
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:08,918
你肯定很高興我沒摔死
You'll be glad to know I didn't fall to my death.

652
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,220
真感謝拉神啊
Praise ra.

653
00:53:10,222 --> 00:53:11,754
如果我死了幫你殺賽特
The deal doesn't count if I die.

654
00:53:11,756 --> 00:53:13,022
整個計劃的重點就是
The whole point is for zaya and I both

655
00:53:13,024 --> 00:53:14,591
我和薩亞一起生活
to be here, together.

656
00:53:14,593 --> 00:53:15,492
能呼吸 !
Breathing!

657
00:53:16,227 --> 00:53:17,060
注意身後 !
Behind you!

658
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,238
荷魯斯 !
Horus!

659
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,138
荷魯斯 !
Horus!

660
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:39,082
親愛的拉神 請幫幫我們 !
Oh, ra, dear ra, please, help us!

661
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:41,951
荷魯斯 !
Horus!

662
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:44,854
我們要摔死了 !
We are going to die!

663
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:02,672
你先請
After you.

664
00:54:14,285 --> 00:54:15,251
你確定你做得到嗎 ?
Are you sure you can do this?

665
00:54:15,253 --> 00:54:17,587
我不都救了你麼 ?
I saved you, didn't I?

666
00:54:17,589 --> 00:54:20,023
- 噢 是你救了我 ?  - 僅僅因為你對我還有用處
Oh, you saved me? Only because you're useful to me.

667
00:54:20,025 --> 00:54:21,591
你知道還有其他什麼有用處嗎 ?
You know what would be useful?

668
00:54:21,593 --> 00:54:23,126
你另一隻眼
Your other eye.

669
00:54:23,128 --> 00:54:24,727
我可以幫你偷回來
I could steal it back for you, if you like.

670
00:54:24,729 --> 00:54:26,162
別考驗我的耐心 凡人
Don't test my Patience, mortal.

671
00:54:26,164 --> 00:54:27,063
我的名字不叫"凡人"
My name is not "Mortal."

672
00:54:30,134 --> 00:54:31,100
那叫什麼 ?
What is it, then?

673
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:32,902
貝克
Bek.

674
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:35,939
好吧 貝克
Very well, bek.

675
00:54:35,941 --> 00:54:37,707
從現在開始 道路會被監視著
The roads will be watched now.

676
00:54:37,709 --> 00:54:38,808
賽特會派出最好的獵手
Set will send better hunters.

677
00:54:51,255 --> 00:54:54,023
看來事情沒按照計劃進行 對吧 ?
Well, that didn't go according to plan, did it?

678
00:54:54,025 --> 00:54:56,125
是的 大人
No, lord.

679
00:54:56,127 --> 00:54:59,262
我侄子僅靠一隻眼就殺了這麼多人 ?
My nephew did all this with one eye?

680
00:54:59,264 --> 00:55:01,230
我低估了他的力量
I underestimated his strength.

681
00:55:01,232 --> 00:55:02,332
那孩子真夠難殺的
Tough to kill, that boy.

682
00:55:04,001 --> 00:55:04,934
和他叔父一樣
Like his uncle.

683
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:08,838
他去哪了 ? 和誰一起的 ?
Where's he going? Who's he allying with?

684
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,074
他唯一的盟友就是那個凡人
His only ally is the mortal.

685
00:55:11,076 --> 00:55:12,809
兩個人可算不上軍隊 對吧 ?
It's hardly an army, is it?

686
00:55:12,811 --> 00:55:14,177
我偷聽了他們的談話
I overheard them.

687
00:55:14,179 --> 00:55:15,244
那凡人和荷魯斯
The mortal spoke of a bargain

688
00:55:15,246 --> 00:55:16,012
談好了一場交易
he'd made with horus.

689
00:55:17,081 --> 00:55:19,782
這凡人膽子真夠大的
This is one ambitious mortal.

690
00:55:19,784 --> 00:55:21,684
荷魯斯已經同意
Horus has agreed

691
00:55:21,686 --> 00:55:23,086
將那凡人的女人救回人世
to bring the mortal's woman back from death.

692
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:26,155
你確定 ?
Are you sure?

693
00:55:26,157 --> 00:55:28,024
我十分確定 大人
I'm certain of it, lord.

694
00:55:32,196 --> 00:55:34,130
你真該去療療傷
You should really get that attended to.

695
00:55:34,132 --> 00:55:36,699
- 謝謝大人  - 幹得好
Yes, lord. Thank you. Good job.

696
00:55:43,774 --> 00:55:46,676
你從一開始就該交給我們來處理的
You should have trusted us with this from the start.

697
00:55:46,678 --> 00:55:47,777
我們不是總能滿足你嗎 ?
Haven't we always left you satisfied?

698
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:52,849
那就再滿足我一次
Then satisfy me again.

699
00:55:59,023 --> 00:56:00,390
你放過你妻子了嗎 ?
Did you let your wife live?

700
00:56:04,662 --> 00:56:07,063
你和我遲早都會
Sooner or later, you and I will end up

701
00:56:07,065 --> 00:56:08,131
變成那樣
just the same.

702
00:56:20,344 --> 00:56:22,679
亡者之地以及九門
The land of the dead and its nine gates.

703
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:26,983
這儀器精準嗎 西方女主人 ?
Is it accurate, mistress of the west?

704
00:56:26,985 --> 00:56:28,685
別這麼叫我
Don't call me that.

705
00:56:28,687 --> 00:56:30,453
我已經拋棄過去了
I left all that behind.

706
00:56:30,455 --> 00:56:33,089
很快 我將統治全世界
Soon, I will rule all the world.

707
00:56:33,091 --> 00:56:35,358
而亡者之地就是
The land of the dead is the final kingdom

708
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,026
最後的王國
left standing.

709
00:56:37,028 --> 00:56:38,261
你追求著擁有不了的東西
You want things you can't have.

710
00:56:41,031 --> 00:56:42,231
我要你帶我過去
I want you to take me there.

711
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:43,900
但你是活人
But you're a living soul.

712
00:56:43,902 --> 00:56:45,935
沒錯 但你當初為亡者做顧問的時候
Yes. And you were a living soul, too,

713
00:56:45,937 --> 00:56:47,904
你也只是個活人
when you were counselor to the dead.

714
00:56:47,906 --> 00:56:49,072
你很明白如果我回去 會有怎樣的下場
You know what's waiting for me if I go back.

715
00:56:50,174 --> 00:56:51,841
你手上的手鐲
You have your little bracelet

716
00:56:51,843 --> 00:56:53,743
能保護你不受惡魔加害
to protect you from those demons.

717
00:56:53,745 --> 00:56:54,711
不是的
It's not that.

718
00:56:56,046 --> 00:56:58,214
你很想念 對吧 ?
You miss it. Don't you?

719
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:02,085
把你塑造成現在這樣的黑暗
The darkness. What it brought out in you.

720
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:04,287
不是
No.

721
00:57:04,289 --> 00:57:07,223
啊 你真不擅長撒謊 愛神
Ah, you're not so good, goddess of love.

722
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:09,992
我知道
I know.

723
00:57:09,994 --> 00:57:11,828
那就帶我去
Then do this.

724
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:15,364
證明你對我的忠誠 然後我們就能擁有一切
Prove your loyalty to me. Then we can have everything.

725
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,500
兩人一起
Together.

726
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:26,509
荷魯斯...
Horus...

727
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:29,846
我的愛人
My love.

728
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,386
荷魯斯...
Horus...

729
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:45,394
你沒在你父親的墓穴 ?
You're not in your father's tomb?

730
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:50,266
我還在好奇他在哪呢
I was wondering where he was.

731
00:57:52,169 --> 00:57:53,169
現在終於知道了
Now I know.

732
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:55,071
謝謝
Thanks.

733
00:57:57,441 --> 00:57:59,842
作為一個能僅僅靠笑容就
For someone who bends the will of men

734
00:57:59,844 --> 00:58:01,077
征服男人的女人
by batting her lashes,

735
00:58:02,012 --> 00:58:03,246
你真不算聰明
you're not very clever.

736
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:06,883
他拿回眼睛多久了 ?
How long has he had his sight?

737
00:58:06,885 --> 00:58:07,984
你幹嘛在乎 ?
Why do you care?

738
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:12,054
我現在是你的人了
I'm yours now.

739
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:14,357
我會遵從你的命令
I'll do as you've asked.

740
00:58:15,526 --> 00:58:16,893
即使我殺了荷魯斯 ?
Even if I kill horus?

741
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,529
當然
Of course.

742
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:22,165
誰在乎他啊 ?
Who cares about him?

743
00:58:25,202 --> 00:58:26,435
我以為你撒謊這麼久了
I'd have thought you'd be exhausted

744
00:58:26,437 --> 00:58:27,870
早就累了呢
from so much lying.

745
00:58:38,215 --> 00:58:41,317
我愛過奈芙蒂斯 而我砍下了她的翅膀
I loved nephthys once and I took her wings.

746
00:58:42,553 --> 00:58:43,820
想想看我會怎麼對你
Imagine what I'll do to you.

747
00:58:46,957 --> 00:58:48,224
你敢下手我就追殺你
Do that and I'll hunt you down.

748
00:58:58,236 --> 00:58:59,302
讓我摸摸看
Let me touch.

749
00:59:14,152 --> 00:59:15,551
估計這樣比逃往要好
I suppose it's better than running.

750
00:59:48,218 --> 00:59:50,386
我們下次能選個好點的營地麼 ?
Can we find a less unpleasant campsite next time?

751
00:59:51,889 --> 00:59:52,555
嗯
Hmm.

752
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:56,993
這堨H前是一個你想都沒想過花園
This used to be a garden like you've never seen.

753
01:00:14,478 --> 01:00:15,311
發生了什麼事 ?
What happened?

754
01:00:17,047 --> 01:00:19,548
這堿O我父親的第一座神廟
It was my father's first temple.

755
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:21,350
他大發慈悲 他對外開放了大門
In his generosity, he opened the grounds

756
01:00:21,352 --> 01:00:22,585
好讓窮人們也能將自己親人埋葬在此
so the poor could bury their own here.

757
01:00:24,521 --> 01:00:26,255
賽特破壞了他的遺產
Set has corrupted his teachings.

758
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,127
我父親很愛這個地方
My father loved this place.

759
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,697
所以賽特將他帶來此處屠殺了
So set brought him here to be butchered.

760
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:40,469
他的遺體被切成了14塊
His body was cut into 14 pieces.

761
01:00:40,471 --> 01:00:42,071
心臟下落不明
The heart was never found.

762
01:00:42,073 --> 01:00:43,606
賽特破壞了土地 ?
Set salted the earth?

763
01:00:43,608 --> 01:00:46,108
不 那是我母親流淚造成的
No. It was my mother's tears.

764
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:49,078
她之後自刎了
Before she took her own life.

765
01:00:51,548 --> 01:00:52,615
我辜負了他們
I failed them.

766
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,319
我很遺憾
I'm sorry.

767
01:00:56,321 --> 01:00:58,721
拉神給我說過 我是在進行旅程
Ra told me I was on a journey.

768
01:01:00,524 --> 01:01:04,193
如果我成功到達旅途盡頭 我就能重拾神力
And if I reach the end, I will be mighty again.

769
01:01:05,729 --> 01:01:07,063
盡頭是什麼 ?
How does it end?

770
01:01:07,065 --> 01:01:08,097
復仇
With vengeance.

771
01:01:10,968 --> 01:01:12,535
用我的長矛穿入賽特的頭骨
Ends with my spear through set's skull.

772
01:01:16,207 --> 01:01:17,406
那是風暴嗎 ?
Is that a storm?

773
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:19,508
可沒有烏雲啊
There's no clouds.

774
01:01:23,514 --> 01:01:25,114
賽特的獵人們騎著寵物來了
Set's hunters riding their pets.

775
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:29,986
那玩意可不算寵物 貓才是寵物
Those aren't pets. A cat is a pet.

776
01:01:29,988 --> 01:01:32,121
就我現在的實力 我抵抗不了它們的毒液
I can't withstand their venom. Not as I am now.

777
01:01:32,123 --> 01:01:33,723
那我們快跑啊
Then I guess we should run.

778
01:01:33,725 --> 01:01:35,658
- 逃跑 ?  - 凡人經常這樣做 !
Run? Mortals do it all the time!

779
01:01:52,242 --> 01:01:53,476
跑快點 !
Run faster!

780
01:01:53,478 --> 01:01:54,410
快不了了 !
I can't!

781
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:00,383
跑快點 !
Run faster!

782
01:02:00,385 --> 01:02:01,384
快不了了 !
I can't!

783
01:02:13,597 --> 01:02:14,463
快跑 !
Come on!

784
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:28,544
- 我們得殺了它們  - "我們" ?
We have to kill them. "We"?

785
01:02:28,546 --> 01:02:30,579
釣魚的首則是什麼 ?
When you go fishing, what's most important?

786
01:02:30,581 --> 01:02:32,248
- 我不釣魚  - 就是魚餌的質量
I don't fish. It's the quality of the bait.

787
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:33,549
太危險了
It's too dangerous.

788
01:02:33,551 --> 01:02:35,251
你在為我擔心 ?
Are you worried about me?

789
01:02:35,253 --> 01:02:37,820
不是 只是我現在投矛的精準度大不如前了
No, it's just my aim with a spear is not what it was.

790
01:02:37,822 --> 01:02:38,587
那投之前靠近點
Then get closer before you throw it.

791
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:49,498
喂 美女 !
Hey! Beautiful!

792
01:02:52,669 --> 01:02:54,303
我指的是蛇 !
I meant the snake!

793
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,340
起作用了 我們再來一次
That worked great. Let's go again.

794
01:03:31,342 --> 01:03:33,709
這次 誘餌得多引誘點時間
This time, the bait needs to dangle longer.

795
01:03:33,711 --> 01:03:35,411
我得攻擊它身後的弱點
I must strike the weak spot from behind.

796
01:03:35,413 --> 01:03:36,679
你是怎麼知道它們有弱點的 ?
And how do you know they have a weak spot?

797
01:03:36,681 --> 01:03:38,347
我不知道 但是肯定有 對吧 ?
I don't. But they must, right?

798
01:03:38,349 --> 01:03:39,215
快去 !
Go!

799
01:04:04,908 --> 01:04:06,542
很好 你把它惹怒了
Excellent! You've made it angry.

800
01:04:22,926 --> 01:04:24,527
真不幸你現在飛不了了
Too bad you can no longer fly.

801
01:04:32,302 --> 01:04:33,302
你也不能
Neither can you.

802
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:07,903
是你 !
You!

803
01:05:09,439 --> 01:05:11,207
閉嘴讓路就是
Just shut up and stay out of my way.

804
01:05:15,646 --> 01:05:19,481
漂亮妹子 你可不是打仗的料
Pretty girl, you don't belong in battle.

805
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,451
燒死她 !
Burn her!

806
01:05:26,957 --> 01:05:29,225
真是可愛的生物啊
What a lovely creature you are.

807
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:31,627
我來幫你
Let me help you.

808
01:05:34,397 --> 01:05:35,664
燒死她 !
Burn her!

809
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:39,468
你感覺很冷
You are so very cold.

810
01:05:40,837 --> 01:05:44,707
為自己加熱吧 我命令你
Warm yourself. I command you.

811
01:05:53,316 --> 01:05:54,250
快走
Quickly.

812
01:06:04,628 --> 01:06:06,262
此墓地歡迎你
Your company was preferable.

813
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:16,639
真是瘋了 !
Outrageous!

814
01:06:16,641 --> 01:06:17,940
救了你一命不用客氣
You're welcome for saving your life.

815
01:06:17,942 --> 01:06:19,875
我雙目失明坐在父親墓穴堛漁伬
So while I was sitting blind in my father's tomb,

816
01:06:19,877 --> 01:06:20,976
你卻和挖出我雙眼的神
you shared a bed with the god

817
01:06:20,978 --> 01:06:22,945
共度春宵
who pulled out my eyes.

818
01:06:22,947 --> 01:06:25,681
為什麼我要把自己的美貌浪費在盲人身上 ?
Why would I waste this on someone who can't see?

819
01:06:25,683 --> 01:06:27,449
那我為什麼要再次信任你 ?
Why would I ever trust you again?

820
01:06:27,451 --> 01:06:29,885
他殺死了所有不臣服於他的神
He's slaying all the gods who won't bow to him.

821
01:06:29,887 --> 01:06:32,321
其中也包括我
That includes me.

822
01:06:32,323 --> 01:06:33,622
我們準備入侵賽特的神廟
We're breaking into set's temple.

823
01:06:33,624 --> 01:06:35,291
由荷魯斯殺了他
Horus is going to kill him.

824
01:06:35,293 --> 01:06:36,392
那你們計劃怎麼進去 ?
How were you planning to get in?

825
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:38,961
他 ?
Him?

826
01:06:38,963 --> 01:06:40,863
他看過建築圖 他識路
He's seen the plans. He knows the way.

827
01:06:40,865 --> 01:06:42,531
那斯芬克斯怎麼辦 ? 難道你忘了 ?
What about the sphinx? Have you forgotten about that?

828
01:06:42,533 --> 01:06:44,633
"斯芬克斯" ?(人面師身的怪物)
"Sphinx"?

829
01:06:44,635 --> 01:06:46,769
賽特抓它來守護火種
Set captured it to guard his fire.

830
01:06:46,771 --> 01:06:49,338
如果進去的人回答不出謎題
It will kill mercilessly all who enter

831
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:50,606
它就會毫不留情的殺死你
if they cannot answer its riddle.

832
01:06:50,608 --> 01:06:51,940
你回答得出謎題 對吧 ?
You can answer the riddle, right?

833
01:06:51,942 --> 01:06:52,808
那我們去請求托特幫忙
We shall ask thoth for help.

834
01:06:54,044 --> 01:06:56,645
神經病才會去聽托特說教
Why would you ever do that on purpose?

835
01:06:56,647 --> 01:06:58,580
找他幫忙才不會被殺
So we won't have to die any sooner than is absolutely necessary.

836
01:06:58,582 --> 01:06:59,815
走吧
Let's go.

837
01:07:11,061 --> 01:07:12,428
這裙子是他送你的 ?
Did he give you that dress?

838
01:07:14,698 --> 01:07:16,665
我從幾條裙子媬麊
I chose from what was provided.

839
01:07:16,667 --> 01:07:17,800
所以你從中選了一條
So you chose the one you thought

840
01:07:17,802 --> 01:07:19,401
最能取悅他的裙子
would please him the most.

841
01:07:19,403 --> 01:07:21,370
- 我穿裙子是為了取悅自己  - 嗯
- I dress to please myself. - Hmm.

842
01:07:21,372 --> 01:07:23,372
怎麼 不喜歡嗎 ?
Why? You don't like it?

843
01:07:23,374 --> 01:07:25,374
太過了
It's too much.

844
01:07:25,376 --> 01:07:27,843
我就是太過了女神
I'm the goddess of too much.

845
01:07:27,845 --> 01:07:29,578
我都給過你好多次
And there's plenty I've given you

846
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:30,479
你當時卻不嫌多
you've never found excessive.

847
01:07:31,648 --> 01:07:32,915
啊
Ah.

848
01:07:32,917 --> 01:07:34,850
現在又太少了
Now it's maybe too little.

849
01:07:34,852 --> 01:07:37,453
你以前可沒這樣難取悅啊
You never used to be so hard to please.

850
01:07:37,455 --> 01:07:38,354
你在拖慢我們的速度
You're slowing us down.

851
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:40,522
噢
Ooh.

852
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:45,661
我覺得你這眼罩把你襯托得很流氓
I think it makes you look roguish.

853
01:07:45,663 --> 01:07:47,529
那我以前是怎樣的 ?
What did I look like before?

854
01:07:47,531 --> 01:07:48,864
- 健忘  - 噢 !
Oblivious. Oh!

855
01:07:48,866 --> 01:07:49,965
但還是挺可愛的
But in a cute way.

856
01:07:49,967 --> 01:07:51,934
什麼健忘 ?
Oblivious of what?

857
01:07:51,936 --> 01:07:54,803
就是這樣 你總覺得我應該討好你
Exactly. You always did take me for granted.

858
01:07:54,805 --> 01:07:56,505
啥 ?
What?

859
01:07:56,507 --> 01:07:58,674
你找回眼睛後 就該來救我的
With your eye back, you should have come to get me.

860
01:07:58,676 --> 01:07:59,908
- 噢 ?  - 難道我還沒滿足你嗎 ?
Oh? Don't I mean enough to you?

861
01:08:14,725 --> 01:08:16,692
乖乖幫我找點淨水喝吧
Be a dear and fetch me some clean water.

862
01:08:20,163 --> 01:08:21,897
說個"請"不行嗎 ?
Would it kill you to say "Please"?

863
01:08:21,899 --> 01:08:24,900
我現在真沒心情吵架
I'm really not in the mood to argue.

864
01:08:24,902 --> 01:08:28,837
去給我找水喝 我命令你
Go get it for me. I command you.

865
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,174
你們這群神都是一個尿性 對吧 ?
You're all the same, aren't you?

866
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:34,777
她叫什麼名字 ?
What's her name?

867
01:08:36,913 --> 01:08:39,415
我能讓任何男人 女人 神 野獸都聽從我的命令
I can make any man, woman, god or beast do my bidding.

868
01:08:39,417 --> 01:08:41,183
除非他們心屬他人
Unless their heart belongs to another.

869
01:08:42,485 --> 01:08:43,585
你戀愛了
You're in love.

870
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:48,624
她叫薩亞
Her name's zaya.

871
01:08:52,796 --> 01:08:54,163
真對不起
I'm so sorry.

872
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:05,040
我答應過她一個舒適的家庭
I promised her a proper home.

873
01:09:05,042 --> 01:09:07,075
有足夠的錢養家 體面的生活
Money for a family. Respectability.

874
01:09:07,077 --> 01:09:09,645
我卻什麼也沒做到
I gave her nothing.

875
01:09:09,647 --> 01:09:10,846
噢 她如果不愛你
Oh, she wouldn't have been with you

876
01:09:10,848 --> 01:09:12,014
就不會和你在一起了
if she didn't love you.

877
01:09:12,016 --> 01:09:13,549
相信我 我很清楚
Believe me, I know.

878
01:09:13,551 --> 01:09:14,783
我會彌補她的
I'm going to make it up to her.

879
01:09:14,785 --> 01:09:15,984
但她不是...
But I thought she...

880
01:09:15,986 --> 01:09:17,152
荷魯斯會救她回來
Horus is going to bring her back.

881
01:09:17,154 --> 01:09:18,887
他這麼說的 ?
He said that?

882
01:09:18,889 --> 01:09:20,522
我知道想要看穿
I know it's hard to see past his

883
01:09:20,524 --> 01:09:22,124
他外表那暴脾氣和復仇的慾望很難 但是...
short temper and proclamations of revenge but...

884
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:24,793
他不是壞人
He's not so bad.

885
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:26,829
確實很難看穿
It is hard to see.

886
01:09:36,206 --> 01:09:37,105
到了
There it is.

887
01:10:08,805 --> 01:10:09,671
那是他嗎 ?
Is that him?

888
01:10:10,807 --> 01:10:13,041
- 他們 ?  - 當然不是
Them? Of course not.

889
01:10:13,043 --> 01:10:14,176
那他們是誰 ?
Then who are they?

890
01:10:14,178 --> 01:10:15,744
他信任的僕人們
His trusted servants.

891
01:10:16,913 --> 01:10:18,814
他只相信他自己
He only trusts himself.

892
01:10:18,816 --> 01:10:20,983
生長得很肥大
Rich with generous compost.

893
01:10:20,985 --> 01:10:23,151
顏色鮮艷
Colorful.

894
01:10:23,153 --> 01:10:26,088
主要是綠色和紅色光譜
Mainly in the green and red spectrums.

895
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:27,479
中間由
Variegated varieties with

896
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:29,925
無數種小花瓣組成
inflorescences composed of multiple florets,

897
01:10:29,927 --> 01:10:32,828
每一瓣都被改進過
each with a modified calyx.

898
01:10:32,830 --> 01:10:36,532
聖言睿智神 我們需求你的智慧
Wise lord of the sacred word, we seek your counsel.

899
01:10:36,534 --> 01:10:39,868
一個種子被連根拔起
Once, a weed, uprooted and burned.

900
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:43,005
現在卻想重回豐饒的土地
Now prized for the vigor of its oils

901
01:10:43,007 --> 01:10:45,173
以及長出自己的枝葉
and the sustenance of its leaves.

902
01:10:45,175 --> 01:10:47,809
但真相是什麼 ?
But what is its truth?

903
01:10:50,947 --> 01:10:53,015
你 ! 轉過身去
You! Turn around.

904
01:10:53,017 --> 01:10:54,082
你喜歡看後面 ?
You prefer the view from behind?

905
01:10:54,084 --> 01:10:57,085
不是 好吧 是
No, I... well, yes.

906
01:10:57,087 --> 01:10:59,221
你很清楚我撒不了慌 轉過去
You know I can't lie. Turn.

907
01:10:59,223 --> 01:11:01,123
我可不打算冒險
I'm not going to risk

908
01:11:01,125 --> 01:11:03,091
看著你那勾人的眼神
looking at those tricky eyes of yours.

909
01:11:03,093 --> 01:11:05,594
- 47  - 什麼 ?
Forty-seven. Excuse me?

910
01:11:05,596 --> 01:11:06,862
我目前已記錄知識的百分比
The percentage of knowledge I have so far recorded.

911
01:11:06,864 --> 01:11:09,197
還沒到一半呢
I'm not even half done.

912
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:12,000
- 托特 我只需要...  - 斯芬克斯謎語的答案
Thoth, I only need... The answer to the riddle of the sphinx.

913
01:11:12,002 --> 01:11:13,969
小孩都能猜到你來的目的
A child could deduce why you're here.

914
01:11:13,971 --> 01:11:15,837
去問出謎題
Go ask the riddle

915
01:11:15,839 --> 01:11:17,739
然後回來講給我聽
and come back and relay it to me.

916
01:11:17,741 --> 01:11:19,041
我就給你解掉
I'll solve it.

917
01:11:19,043 --> 01:11:21,009
那我們其中一人就得死
One of us would have to die.

918
01:11:21,011 --> 01:11:22,978
那就抽籤吧
Well, draw lots.

919
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:25,213
- 和我們一起去  - 哈 !
Come with us. Ha!

920
01:11:25,215 --> 01:11:27,816
- 我和你睡一晚  - 嗯
One night. I'll give you one night. Hmm...

921
01:11:27,818 --> 01:11:29,351
才不行
No, you won't.

922
01:11:29,353 --> 01:11:32,087
必須趕在賽特毀滅我們所有人之前阻止他
Set must be stopped before he destroys us all.

923
01:11:32,089 --> 01:11:34,690
你明白這道理 對吧 ?
You see the wisdom in that, don't you?

924
01:11:34,692 --> 01:11:38,226
我不能拿我的大腦冒險
This is far too important to risk.

925
01:11:38,228 --> 01:11:40,295
我可以背誦出群星的真名
I can recite the true names of the stars.

926
01:11:40,297 --> 01:11:41,897
我知道
I know.

927
01:11:41,899 --> 01:11:43,599
我見過由沙和水組成的世界
I've seen the world created from sand and water.

928
01:11:43,601 --> 01:11:45,100
嗯哼
Mmm-hmm.

929
01:11:45,102 --> 01:11:46,802
我大腦埵野宇宙的知識
I contain all the wisdom in the universe.

930
01:11:46,804 --> 01:11:48,937
比什麼王冠寶貴多了
More precious than some crown.

931
01:11:48,939 --> 01:11:51,306
哈 ! 我想到了 !
Ha! I have it!

932
01:11:51,308 --> 01:11:53,642
這是秘密 這是精華 這是真理
Its mystery. Its essence. Its truth.

933
01:11:54,711 --> 01:11:55,811
這只是生菜而已 !
It's lettuce!

934
01:11:56,913 --> 01:11:59,381
你父親自己大意了
Your father dropped his guard.

935
01:11:59,383 --> 01:12:01,984
那不僅僅是愚蠢之極的行為
That was not only extremely stupid,

936
01:12:01,986 --> 01:12:04,853
搞的我現在必須記錄下我所知的一切
but now I'm forced to write down everything I know

937
01:12:04,855 --> 01:12:06,822
為了預防賽特找我開戰
as a defense against the remote possibility

938
01:12:06,824 --> 01:12:08,857
的可能性
that set's war finds me.

939
01:12:08,859 --> 01:12:12,060
我真抱歉我父母的遺體
I'm sorry that the corpses of my parents

940
01:12:12,062 --> 01:12:13,795
給你造成了不便
have inconvenienced you.

941
01:12:13,797 --> 01:12:16,932
接受你的道歉了 現在滾吧 !
Apology accepted. Now, get out!

942
01:12:16,934 --> 01:12:19,267
你必須得幫我們 !
But you have to help us!

943
01:12:20,638 --> 01:12:22,137
小心點
Careful.

944
01:12:22,139 --> 01:12:24,106
我人數比你多
I outnumber you.

945
01:12:26,109 --> 01:12:27,108
等等 !
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

946
01:12:29,112 --> 01:12:31,380
沒關係 由我來吧
It's fine. I'll do it.

947
01:12:31,382 --> 01:12:33,682
我剛還以為你是只離群狒狒
I thought you were a stray baboon.

948
01:12:33,684 --> 01:12:36,118
我說了 由我去面對斯芬克斯
I told you I'd be the one to face the sphinx.

949
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:38,954
你失敗的幾率就快突破雲霄了
Your chance of failure is overwhelming.

950
01:12:38,956 --> 01:12:40,956
沒錯 可在它殺死我之前
I'm sure. But before it kills me

951
01:12:40,958 --> 01:12:41,857
我會告訴它
I'm going to tell it that I asked

952
01:12:41,859 --> 01:12:43,158
我叫過睿智神一起來
the god of wisdom to come

953
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:45,360
但他卻害怕猜不中謎題
but he was afraid he'd get the answer wrong.

954
01:12:45,362 --> 01:12:47,896
這就是你最好的戰術了 ?
This is the cleverest strategy you could devise?

955
01:12:47,898 --> 01:12:49,698
激將法 ?
Playing on my ego?

956
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:51,700
你覺得我有多自負 ?
How vain do you think I am?

957
01:12:54,771 --> 01:12:56,138
額...
Um... hmm.

958
01:12:59,308 --> 01:13:00,242
好吧...
Yes, well...

959
01:13:01,177 --> 01:13:02,244
好吧
Fine.

960
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:04,146
好吧 !
Fine!

961
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:09,217
我們走吧
Let's go.

962
01:13:11,254 --> 01:13:12,154
拜
Bye.

963
01:13:14,424 --> 01:13:15,991
幹得漂亮
Well done.

964
01:13:15,993 --> 01:13:17,125
謝謝誇獎
Thank you.

965
01:13:32,308 --> 01:13:34,810
你明知薩亞永遠回不來了
You know his zaya can never come back.

966
01:13:34,812 --> 01:13:36,478
國王根本沒有這種力量
The king doesn't have the power.

967
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,814
阿努比斯也沒這種力量
Anubis doesn't have the power.

968
01:13:38,816 --> 01:13:39,715
你騙了他
You deceived him.

969
01:13:41,951 --> 01:13:44,152
他很可能會在進入賽特的金字塔途中就死掉
He will probably die trying to break into set's pyramid.

970
01:13:44,154 --> 01:13:46,188
他的交易籌碼就是生命
He offered his life.

971
01:13:46,190 --> 01:13:47,956
那是因為他以為自己能救回愛人
Because he thought he could save her.

972
01:13:47,958 --> 01:13:49,491
他自己願意相信 我能怎樣
He believes what he wants to believe.

973
01:13:49,493 --> 01:13:52,728
你瞎的地方不止是眼睛
You've been blind in more ways than one.

974
01:13:52,730 --> 01:13:54,496
你真見證了世界的誕生 ?
You really watched the world come into being?

975
01:13:54,498 --> 01:13:56,298
我從不撒謊
I don't lie.

976
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:57,432
那你是從哪看的
Where were you watching it from,

977
01:13:57,434 --> 01:13:59,201
不是所有事物都還沒誕生嗎 ?
if nothing had been created yet?

978
01:13:59,203 --> 01:14:02,003
如果我解釋出口
If I even attempted to explain,

979
01:14:02,005 --> 01:14:03,805
你的小腦袋肯定受不了 直接七竅流血
your brain would liquefy and run out of your ears.

980
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:07,876
復仇之路又不是我選的
I did not choose a path of revenge.

981
01:14:07,878 --> 01:14:09,745
我根本沒選擇這一切
I chose none of this.

982
01:14:09,747 --> 01:14:11,413
你倒是給我說 我到底有什麼力量 ?
You tell me what kind of power do I really have?

983
01:14:11,415 --> 01:14:14,316
你有彌補這件事的力量
You have the power to make this right.

984
01:14:14,318 --> 01:14:16,418
他有權利知道真相
He deserves to know the truth.

985
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:20,288
我需要他帶我們進去 澆滅賽特的火焰
I need him to get us in to choke set's fire.

986
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:22,190
如果他拒絕了 我們都會死 難道你希望這樣 ?
If he refuses, we'll all die. Is that what you want?

987
01:14:34,904 --> 01:14:36,872
橫穿進去太危險了
It's too dangerous to cross the plain.

988
01:14:36,874 --> 01:14:38,173
我們等到晚上再行動
We'll wait for darkness.

989
01:14:38,175 --> 01:14:40,242
可我們要沒時間了
But we're running out of time.

990
01:14:40,244 --> 01:14:42,010
- 我說我們現在就穿過去  - 我說了等到晚上
I say we cross now. And I say we wait.

991
01:14:53,189 --> 01:14:56,792
在你們分開的這段時間 她從沒忘記過你
All the time you were apart, she never forgot you.

992
01:14:58,194 --> 01:15:00,195
哈索爾心堣@直愛著你
You've always been in hathor's heart, you know.

993
01:15:00,197 --> 01:15:02,497
沒錯 但她的心可夠大的
Yes, but she's got a big heart.

994
01:15:02,499 --> 01:15:03,865
都夠住進好多人了
Room enough for a crowd in there.

995
01:15:05,268 --> 01:15:09,171
告訴我 睿智的天空神
Tell me, oh, wise lord of the air.

996
01:15:09,173 --> 01:15:10,939
你覺得賽特是為什麼放了你一條生路 ?
Why do you think set let you live?

997
01:15:13,075 --> 01:15:14,976
她為了愛才屈身於他的
She did it for love.

998
01:15:14,978 --> 01:15:17,512
而你卻要以此懲罰她 ?
You'd punish her for that?

999
01:15:17,514 --> 01:15:19,548
我根本不需要她幫忙
I didn't want her help.

1000
01:15:21,551 --> 01:15:23,285
我只期望過一件事
I only ever wanted one thing.

1001
01:15:24,587 --> 01:15:28,857
知道嗎 我覺得所有人都是傻子
You know, I think everyone's a fool.

1002
01:15:28,859 --> 01:15:31,259
但你比大部分人都傻  大人
But you, my lord, are bigger than most.

1003
01:15:48,411 --> 01:15:49,544
你在想她嗎 ?
Are you thinking about her?

1004
01:15:52,915 --> 01:15:54,249
你當然在想了
Of course you are.

1005
01:15:56,619 --> 01:16:00,155
我以前被稱作西方女主人
I was once known as the mistress of the west.

1006
01:16:00,157 --> 01:16:02,290
我的責任是幫助亡魂
My duty was to help dead souls

1007
01:16:02,292 --> 01:16:04,392
找到前往來世的路
make their way to the afterlife.

1008
01:16:04,394 --> 01:16:06,595
你去過亡者之地 ?
You traveled to the land of the dead?

1009
01:16:06,597 --> 01:16:09,064
我可是愛神 當然也愛著亡者
I'm the goddess of love. Even to those who have died.

1010
01:16:10,299 --> 01:16:13,401
我以前很年輕 很容易被誘惑
I was young. Easily seduced.

1011
01:16:13,403 --> 01:16:15,003
"誘惑" ?
"Seduced"?

1012
01:16:15,005 --> 01:16:16,438
惡魔
Demons.

1013
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,506
這手鐲封印著它們
This keeps them at bay.

1014
01:16:18,508 --> 01:16:21,610
42星手鐲
The bracelet of 42 stars.

1015
01:16:21,612 --> 01:16:24,880
每一顆星都代表荷魯斯為釋放我殺死的惡魔
One for each of the demons horus slayed to free me.

1016
01:16:24,882 --> 01:16:27,015
當時我就愛上他了
That's when I knew I loved him.

1017
01:16:27,017 --> 01:16:29,184
也得讓薩亞知道你在為她奮鬥才行
Zaya needs to know you're fighting for her.

1018
01:16:29,186 --> 01:16:30,552
這樣她才不會失去希望
So she does not lose hope.

1019
01:16:36,893 --> 01:16:37,459
薩亞
Zaya.

1020
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:42,631
薩亞
Zaya.

1021
01:16:45,368 --> 01:16:48,403
薩亞 ? 薩亞 ? 能聽見我嗎 ?
Zaya? Zaya? Can you hear me?

1022
01:16:49,205 --> 01:16:50,238
薩亞 ?
Zaya?

1023
01:16:51,073 --> 01:16:52,240
你是誰 ?
Who is it?

1024
01:16:53,509 --> 01:16:55,508
誰在說話 ?
Who's there?

1025
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:58,346
- 哈索爾 西方女主人  - 女主人
- Hathor, mistress of the west. - Mistress.

1026
01:16:58,348 --> 01:17:00,248
我在活人世界與你對話
I speak to you from the land of the living.

1027
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:01,583
你的愛人在我身邊
Your beloved is with me.

1028
01:17:01,585 --> 01:17:03,084
- 貝克 ?  - 薩亞 是我
Bek? Zaya, it's me.

1029
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:06,388
我就知道你能想出辦法的
I knew if there was a way, you would find it.

1030
01:17:08,257 --> 01:17:10,191
但是我看不到你
But I can't see you.

1031
01:17:10,193 --> 01:17:11,092
聽著 我們能再次重逢
Listen, we can be together again.

1032
01:17:11,094 --> 01:17:12,060
你可以重回人世
You can return.

1033
01:17:12,062 --> 01:17:12,961
怎麼回 ?
But how?

1034
01:17:14,163 --> 01:17:15,397
我幫助荷魯斯
I'm helping horus.

1035
01:17:15,399 --> 01:17:18,066
而作為回報 他也會幫助我們
In return, he's going to help us.

1036
01:17:18,068 --> 01:17:19,935
你真是我愛的那個貝克嗎 ?
It is really the bek I love?

1037
01:17:19,937 --> 01:17:22,203
沒錯 薩亞 我自己也不敢相信
I know, zaya. I can hardly believe it myself.

1038
01:17:22,205 --> 01:17:23,571
我居然在相信眾神
Bek, me, trusting the gods.

1039
01:17:24,674 --> 01:17:26,341
我之前說錯了 薩亞
But I was wrong, zaya.

1040
01:17:26,343 --> 01:17:28,576
荷魯斯是位明神 如你所言
Horus is a just god, as you said he would be.

1041
01:17:28,578 --> 01:17:30,478
你現在肯定在想 "我早就說過了"
You're probably thinking, "I told you so," Right now.

1042
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,981
沒錯 確實想了下
Well, yes. Just a little bit.

1043
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:36,151
能聽見你的聲音真是太好了
It's so good to hear your voice.

1044
01:17:36,153 --> 01:17:38,286
一切都會好起來的 薩亞 相信我
Everything's going to be fine, zaya, trust me.

1045
01:17:38,288 --> 01:17:40,221
荷魯斯會救你回來
Horus is going to bring you back.

1046
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:41,089
我相信他
I know he will.

1047
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:43,525
貝克 ?
Bek?

1048
01:17:45,194 --> 01:17:46,227
貝克 你還在嗎 ?
Bek, are you there?

1049
01:17:49,366 --> 01:17:52,067
亡者是不允許和活人對話的
It is forbidden for the dead to speak with the living.

1050
01:17:53,636 --> 01:17:54,536
快去
Go.

1051
01:18:18,361 --> 01:18:20,261
堶惘陪蚋鉠
There's a wheel inside.

1052
01:18:20,263 --> 01:18:22,297
轉動的話 沙子就會停下來
When you turn it, the sand stops moving.

1053
01:18:22,299 --> 01:18:24,065
我們只需要通過大門就行
We just need to go through the door.

1054
01:18:24,067 --> 01:18:25,600
好在你看過建築圖
Good thing you saw those plans.

1055
01:18:25,602 --> 01:18:27,702
如果不知道是哪個的話
If you didn't know which one it was,

1056
01:18:27,704 --> 01:18:28,503
想進去真是不可能
this would truly be impossible.

1057
01:18:30,506 --> 01:18:33,074
- 貝克 ?  - 嗯 ?
Bek? Yes?

1058
01:18:33,076 --> 01:18:34,776
你知道門在哪吧 ?
You do know which is the door, right?

1059
01:18:35,745 --> 01:18:37,312
當然 是...
Yes, of course, it's...

1060
01:18:37,314 --> 01:18:38,246
這個
This one.

1061
01:18:40,182 --> 01:18:41,516
不對 是那個
No, no, it's... It's that one.

1062
01:18:42,284 --> 01:18:44,085
不對 是這個 !
No, no, it's this one!

1063
01:18:56,399 --> 01:18:57,399
祝我好運吧
Roll the bones.

1064
01:19:42,545 --> 01:19:43,511
你是猜的 ?
You guessed?

1065
01:19:43,513 --> 01:19:45,580
額...
Well...

1066
01:19:45,582 --> 01:19:49,084
我真不喜歡你這靠運氣的做法
I find your dependence on chance troubling.

1067
01:19:49,086 --> 01:19:50,385
如果你能繼續活下去
If you continue to survive,

1068
01:19:50,387 --> 01:19:51,519
我可能得好好研究下你了
I may need to study you further.

1069
01:19:52,555 --> 01:19:54,622
好了 哪條路通往斯芬克斯 ?
Now, which way to the sphinx?

1070
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:30,158
國王神殿的入侵者
Trespassers in the house of the king,

1071
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:32,560
回答我的謎題 要麼領死
answer my riddle or cease to be.

1072
01:20:33,462 --> 01:20:34,496
說吧
Go on.

1073
01:20:35,264 --> 01:20:36,364
我等著呢
I'm waiting.

1074
01:20:38,668 --> 01:20:40,435
我不存在於過去
I never was.

1075
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:44,239
但我永遠存在
Am always to be.

1076
01:20:44,241 --> 01:20:47,909
沒人見過我的面目
No one ever saw me, nor ever will.

1077
01:20:47,911 --> 01:20:51,513
而我是所有生靈活著的追求
And yet I am the confidence of all who live and breathe.

1078
01:20:51,515 --> 01:20:54,682
我是什麼 ?
What am I?

1079
01:20:55,885 --> 01:20:58,720
秩序 你是秩序
Order. You are order.

1080
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:04,359
我從沒懷疑過你
I never doubted you.

1081
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:11,266
不對
Incorrect.

1082
01:21:12,735 --> 01:21:14,669
請再試一次
Try again. Please.

1083
01:21:16,772 --> 01:21:18,573
這答案這麼準確
That was a completely suitable answer.

1084
01:21:20,544 --> 01:21:22,210
你是純粹
You are purity.

1085
01:21:29,553 --> 01:21:31,819
又錯了
Wrong again.

1086
01:21:31,821 --> 01:21:33,955
"不存在於過去"
"What never was."

1087
01:21:33,957 --> 01:21:36,724
"但永遠存在"
"Always to be."

1088
01:21:36,726 --> 01:21:38,493
也就是在未來的 不存在的 想像出來的
In the future. Non-existent. Imaginary.

1089
01:21:41,263 --> 01:21:42,730
但是
Yet...

1090
01:21:42,732 --> 01:21:45,567
確實存在過 而且"沒存在於過去"
Yet it exists and "Never was."

1091
01:21:45,569 --> 01:21:48,436
- "永遠存在"  - 托特...
"Always to be." Thoth...

1092
01:21:48,438 --> 01:21:50,572
而我是所有生靈活著的追求
Yet I'm the confidence of all who live and breathe.

1093
01:21:50,574 --> 01:21:51,973
凡人就得呼吸 !
Mortals live and breathe!

1094
01:21:51,975 --> 01:21:53,408
要不別用神的思維來思考
Maybe stop thinking like a god.

1095
01:21:53,410 --> 01:21:54,300
那我還不如直接不思考了呢
Then I might as well stop thinking.

1096
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:55,510
托特 !
Thoth!

1097
01:21:56,612 --> 01:21:57,912
等下 我想到了 !
Wait, wait, I have it!

1098
01:21:57,914 --> 01:21:59,747
你是明日
You are tomorrow.

1099
01:21:59,749 --> 01:22:01,583
該死
Oh, bother.

1100
01:22:23,973 --> 01:22:24,872
只需一滴
One drop.

1101
01:22:37,954 --> 01:22:39,454
不 !
No!

1102
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:48,496
我真該謝謝你
I should thank you.

1103
01:22:50,633 --> 01:22:52,600
你把他從圖書館堣牏F出來 省了我一趟
You lured him from his library so that I didn't have to.

1104
01:22:55,938 --> 01:22:57,839
最後的碎片
The final piece.

1105
01:22:57,841 --> 01:22:59,607
你個懦夫
You coward.

1106
01:22:59,609 --> 01:23:00,808
把陷阱打開和我戰鬥
Open this gate and fight me.

1107
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:01,709
又打 ?
Again?

1108
01:23:03,445 --> 01:23:05,947
難道她還沒看夠你一敗塗地嗎 ?
Hasn't she's seen you lose enough?

1109
01:23:05,949 --> 01:23:07,548
你就不能容我
Can't you allow me to spare you

1110
01:23:07,550 --> 01:23:09,350
在你死前 放過你
one last moment of embarrassment

1111
01:23:09,352 --> 01:23:10,318
最後的尊嚴嗎 ?
before you die?

1112
01:23:11,353 --> 01:23:12,287
住手 !
Stop!

1113
01:23:14,290 --> 01:23:15,056
認出來了嗎 ?
Recognize this?

1114
01:23:18,527 --> 01:23:20,595
他有沒有給你說過他能救活你女人 ?
Did he tell you he could bring your woman back from death?

1115
01:23:21,964 --> 01:23:22,730
那是不可能的
It's not possible.

1116
01:23:24,066 --> 01:23:25,700
就算是我也不能
Not even for me.

1117
01:23:25,702 --> 01:23:27,001
你覺得我會信你 ?
You expect me to believe you?

1118
01:23:28,904 --> 01:23:30,371
我沒必要撒謊
I don't have to lie.

1119
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:33,541
要不然一個雙目失明的廢神
How else would a blind, useless god

1120
01:23:33,543 --> 01:23:34,409
要怎麼做才能讓你幫他 ?
get you to help him?

1121
01:23:36,745 --> 01:23:37,745
去啊
Go on.

1122
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:39,480
問他吧
Ask him.

1123
01:23:41,617 --> 01:23:43,785
- 快倒啊  - 是真的嗎 ?
Pour it in. Is it true?

1124
01:23:43,787 --> 01:23:45,486
貝克 快倒 !
Bek, pour it in!

1125
01:23:46,822 --> 01:23:47,822
不 !
No!

1126
01:24:00,402 --> 01:24:02,770
真遺憾你沒站我這邊
Shame you weren't on my side.

1127
01:24:02,772 --> 01:24:05,873
我很尊敬那些不怕死的人
I admire someone that doesn't let death stand in his way.

1128
01:24:05,875 --> 01:24:08,776
不過 這就是愛情的下場
But this is what love gets you.

1129
01:24:11,447 --> 01:24:12,747
你倆一起死在我神殿
It's quite fitting that you'll both

1130
01:24:12,749 --> 01:24:14,949
真是太適合不過了
die together here in my house.

1131
01:24:14,951 --> 01:24:16,718
我會想念這段對話的
I'll miss the conversation.

1132
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:17,919
以及你們的死相
And the rest.

1133
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:12,173
你阻止了我復仇
You denied me vengeance.

1134
01:25:14,177 --> 01:25:15,510
薩亞相信你是
Zaya thought you were

1135
01:25:15,512 --> 01:25:16,144
所有創造物堻怜隊j的
the greatest thing in all of creation.

1136
01:25:18,414 --> 01:25:19,714
每天每日 她都祈禱著你能拯救埃及
Every day, she prayed for you to save Egypt,

1137
01:25:19,716 --> 01:25:21,082
但你沒回來
but you didn't come.

1138
01:25:21,084 --> 01:25:23,484
我當時在墓穴 我聽不到祈禱
I was in a tomb. I didn't hear.

1139
01:25:23,486 --> 01:25:25,486
不對 你是根本沒聽
No, you didn't listen.

1140
01:25:25,488 --> 01:25:27,486
你只在乎你的復仇計劃
All you care about is your stupid vengeance.

1141
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:30,558
我都開始覺得自己之前錯怪你了
I started to think I was wrong about you.

1142
01:25:32,161 --> 01:25:33,828
但我現在終於認清了事實
But I've finally learned the lesson of the gods.

1143
01:25:33,830 --> 01:25:34,695
你們根本不在乎我們
We don't matter to you.

1144
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:38,766
你現在清楚了吧
Well, now you know.

1145
01:25:56,618 --> 01:25:57,919
阿努比斯 現身吧
Anubis, come forth.

1146
01:26:05,194 --> 01:26:07,462
女主人
Mistress.

1147
01:26:07,464 --> 01:26:10,565
你還是如同破曉般美麗
You are still as lovely as the first dawn.

1148
01:26:10,567 --> 01:26:12,533
哈索爾 你幹嘛 ?
Hathor, what are you doing?

1149
01:26:12,535 --> 01:26:15,470
這位凡人的愛人身上無任何財寶
This mortal's beloved bears no treasure for the scales.

1150
01:26:15,472 --> 01:26:17,171
我們幫幫她吧
Perhaps we can help her.

1151
01:26:17,173 --> 01:26:19,974
這要求太過了 女主人
You ask much, mistress.

1152
01:26:19,976 --> 01:26:23,511
必須獻上一個非常特殊的珍寶
It would require a very special treasure indeed.

1153
01:26:23,513 --> 01:26:24,846
不
No.

1154
01:26:24,848 --> 01:26:26,714
- 不 !  - 比如這個 ?
No. No! Like this?

1155
01:26:26,716 --> 01:26:29,016
如果是你的話 西方女主人
For you, mistress of the west?

1156
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:31,953
可以
Yes.

1157
01:26:31,955 --> 01:26:34,121
賜予他前去將財寶給她的機會
Grant him passage to give it to her himself.

1158
01:26:37,793 --> 01:26:38,759
你能最後一次與她相見
You will see her one last time.

1159
01:26:39,828 --> 01:26:40,695
謝謝你
Thank you.

1160
01:26:42,831 --> 01:26:45,099
不行 不許你這樣
No, no, I forbid it.

1161
01:26:45,101 --> 01:26:47,535
我們都背上了欺騙貝克的罪名
We're both guilty of deceiving bek.

1162
01:26:47,537 --> 01:26:48,803
這樣才能贖罪
This will make amends.

1163
01:26:48,805 --> 01:26:52,106
不能用這種方法 不能你自己送死
Not like this. Not with you.

1164
01:26:52,108 --> 01:26:54,976
我命令你放開我
I command you to release me.

1165
01:26:54,978 --> 01:26:57,979
你又命令不了我 你明知原因
You can't command me. You know why.

1166
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:02,717
我是愛神
I'm the goddess of love.

1167
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:08,155
如果我不幫他們 那我算什麼
If I don't do this, I'm nothing.

1168
01:27:08,157 --> 01:27:10,258
我不能再失去你了
I can't lose you again.

1169
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:49,030
拿去吧
Take it.

1170
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:02,310
去做該做之事吧
Do what you need to do.

1171
01:28:21,363 --> 01:28:22,863
真相之廳
The hall of two truths.

1172
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,300
我們會在這接受審判
Where we shall be judged.

1173
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:30,905
上前來
Step forward.

1174
01:28:44,886 --> 01:28:46,754
你獻上什麼 ?
What do you offer?

1175
01:28:54,730 --> 01:28:55,997
往前走
Step forward.

1176
01:29:00,736 --> 01:29:04,338
我要永生了 !
I shall live forever!

1177
01:29:08,410 --> 01:29:09,910
你獻上什麼 ?
What do you offer?

1178
01:29:19,888 --> 01:29:22,390
往前走
Step forward.

1179
01:29:39,841 --> 01:29:41,876
上前來
Step forward.

1180
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:53,954
你獻上什麼 ?
What do you offer?

1181
01:29:56,024 --> 01:29:58,325
你獻上什麼 ?
What do you offer?

1182
01:30:07,469 --> 01:30:08,369
薩亞
Zaya.

1183
01:30:09,771 --> 01:30:10,838
貝克
Bek.

1184
01:30:37,399 --> 01:30:39,300
賽特
Set,

1185
01:30:39,302 --> 01:30:43,104
奈芙蒂斯的羽翼
receive the golden wings of nephthys.

1186
01:30:43,106 --> 01:30:46,006
願羽翼保護他免受加害
May they protect him from those who would harm.

1187
01:30:59,087 --> 01:31:02,823
托特的大腦 睿智神
The karr of thoth, god of wisdom.

1188
01:31:02,825 --> 01:31:05,092
願他擁有遠古的智慧
Allow him knowledge of old.

1189
01:31:10,966 --> 01:31:13,534
奧西奡答漱萲
The heart of osiris.

1190
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:16,337
賜予他所有土地的統治權
Grant him dominion over all lands.

1191
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:20,975
全知之眼
The all-seeing eye.

1192
01:31:20,977 --> 01:31:24,178
獎勵他不受敵人欺騙
Reward him so no enemy can deceive.

1193
01:31:41,229 --> 01:31:42,930
您看上去真是太輝煌了 大人
You look glorious, lord.

1194
01:31:46,868 --> 01:31:48,135
我知道
I know.

1195
01:32:08,390 --> 01:32:09,256
父親...
Father...

1196
01:32:14,196 --> 01:32:16,297
我看到你的塔了 真宏偉
I noticed the tower. Impressive.

1197
01:32:17,299 --> 01:32:19,333
我為你建造的
I built it for you.

1198
01:32:19,335 --> 01:32:22,136
如果建的再高一點 都能擋道我的道了
If it were any taller, it would be in my way.

1199
01:32:22,138 --> 01:32:25,306
把眼睛從這艘船上移開吧
Turn your eyes from your sails

1200
01:32:25,308 --> 01:32:26,440
看看我取得的成就
and look at everything I've done.

1201
01:32:28,577 --> 01:32:30,511
連奧西奡絨ㄗS做到的事
What osiris never could.

1202
01:32:30,513 --> 01:32:32,112
我統治著眾神
I rule all that breathes.

1203
01:32:33,481 --> 01:32:34,982
以及低階的凡人
And all that is breathed upon.

1204
01:32:36,251 --> 01:32:39,086
任何人都不會比太陽強大
None is mightier below the sun.

1205
01:32:39,088 --> 01:32:42,189
那就給我以榮譽 就如我給您榮譽一樣
Then honor me as I've honored you.

1206
01:32:42,191 --> 01:32:44,124
如果你講榮譽的話
If honor had been your intent,

1207
01:32:44,126 --> 01:32:47,161
你當時就不會殺害你哥哥了
you might have abstained from murdering your brother.

1208
01:32:47,163 --> 01:32:50,197
所以你還是注意到凡間的事了
So you do see everything down there.

1209
01:32:50,199 --> 01:32:53,167
告訴我 父親 你在乎凡間的情況嗎 ?
Tell me, father, do you care what happens?

1210
01:32:55,203 --> 01:32:58,572
我比你想的更在乎
I care more than you know.

1211
01:32:58,574 --> 01:33:00,274
那為什麼我獨自被驅逐
Then why was I cast out alone

1212
01:33:02,277 --> 01:33:04,111
被迫踏上熱沙之路
to walk on burning sand

1213
01:33:05,547 --> 01:33:08,349
而我哥哥卻能光著腳
while my brother played barefoot

1214
01:33:08,351 --> 01:33:10,050
享受著尼羅河的清涼 ?
by the shores of the nile?

1215
01:33:13,054 --> 01:33:15,189
您為什麼讓奧西奡絲禨磥 ?
Why did you make osiris king?

1216
01:33:15,191 --> 01:33:18,592
為什麼你要給他一個兒子
And why did you give him a son?

1217
01:33:18,594 --> 01:33:21,328
而卻不讓我擁有製造生命的機會 ?
And yet you denied me the chance to even give life.

1218
01:33:21,330 --> 01:33:23,430
這是你的測驗
This was your test.

1219
01:33:23,432 --> 01:33:24,932
你可沒測驗他
You didn't test him.

1220
01:33:24,934 --> 01:33:27,001
我給了奧西奡筑J及王冠的權利
I gave osiris the crown of Egypt.

1221
01:33:28,536 --> 01:33:32,606
而當測驗之時來臨時 他沒有死抓住權利不放
And when the time came, he didn't cling to his power.

1222
01:33:32,608 --> 01:33:37,311
他贈與給了其他人 他通過了測試
He gave it away freely. He passed his test.

1223
01:33:37,313 --> 01:33:38,979
而我覺得我也通過了測試
And I'd wager I've passed mine.

1224
01:33:38,981 --> 01:33:39,680
還沒有
Not yet.

1225
01:33:41,016 --> 01:33:43,284
沒錯...
It's true...

1226
01:33:43,286 --> 01:33:45,019
我是不想讓你擁有後代
I did not want you to have children.

1227
01:33:45,954 --> 01:33:48,088
這是善意之舉
This was a kindness,

1228
01:33:48,090 --> 01:33:49,623
因為我不想讓你像我這樣
because I did not want you to miss them

1229
01:33:49,625 --> 01:33:51,191
倍受想念孩子的煎熬
as terribly as I have.

1230
01:33:51,193 --> 01:33:52,026
想念 ?
Miss them?

1231
01:33:53,962 --> 01:33:55,262
我需要你接替我
I need you to take my place.

1232
01:33:57,699 --> 01:33:59,199
這 ?
Here?

1233
01:33:59,201 --> 01:34:01,936
這奡N是你測驗的終點 兒子
This is how your test ends, my son.

1234
01:34:01,938 --> 01:34:03,570
再也沒有比這更重的負擔了
There is no greater burden.

1235
01:34:06,141 --> 01:34:07,408
但也意味著巨大的榮耀
But no greater honor.

1236
01:34:10,679 --> 01:34:13,480
你的所作所為都能被原諒
All you have done can be forgiven.

1237
01:34:19,721 --> 01:34:24,291
你想讓我與這頭怪物作戰
You expect me to joust with this beast

1238
01:34:25,727 --> 01:34:29,596
夜以繼夜 直到死去 ?
night after night until I die?

1239
01:34:29,598 --> 01:34:31,198
你想要什麼 ?
What do you want?

1240
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,534
不朽之身
Immortality.

1241
01:34:33,536 --> 01:34:37,137
不朽就在來世等著我們所有人
Immortality awaits us all in the afterlife.

1242
01:34:37,139 --> 01:34:39,740
我不想死 我想活著
I don't want to die. I want to live.

1243
01:34:39,742 --> 01:34:41,542
永遠活著
Forever.

1244
01:34:41,544 --> 01:34:43,711
在我統治的凡間
Down there in the lands I conquered.

1245
01:34:43,713 --> 01:34:45,045
我的王國
My kingdom.

1246
01:34:45,047 --> 01:34:47,281
這才是我應得的獎賞
This should be my reward.

1247
01:34:47,283 --> 01:34:50,517
怎麼做 ? 能達成這個目標的方法是萬惡之最
How? The only way to achieve this is unthinkable.

1248
01:34:50,519 --> 01:34:52,453
必須吞噬掉...
One would need to devour...

1249
01:34:52,455 --> 01:34:54,388
來世本身
The afterlife itself.

1250
01:34:54,390 --> 01:34:56,757
你要讓世間充滿混沌 ?
You would unleash chaos upon creation?

1251
01:34:56,759 --> 01:34:59,026
你願意毀滅一切 ?
You would destroy everything?

1252
01:34:59,028 --> 01:35:01,695
不是毀滅 而是重塑
Not destroy. Reshape it.

1253
01:35:01,697 --> 01:35:04,398
我會接替你的位置
I will take your place.

1254
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:06,200
但我可不會坐在你這破船上
But it won't be sitting on some damn boat.

1255
01:35:30,558 --> 01:35:32,259
沒有神能撐得住太陽能量
No god could withstand that.

1256
01:35:34,162 --> 01:35:36,030
我可不只是一個神
I'm not just one god.

1257
01:36:12,700 --> 01:36:15,569
你獻上什麼 ?
What do you offer?

1258
01:36:15,571 --> 01:36:17,571
這手鐲能買到通往來世的路
This will buy you a place in the afterlife.

1259
01:36:17,573 --> 01:36:18,439
不
No.

1260
01:36:19,741 --> 01:36:21,141
沒有你我不去
Not without you.

1261
01:36:31,353 --> 01:36:33,754
來世之門被破壞了 !
The gate has been broken!

1262
01:36:33,756 --> 01:36:36,123
混沌正在擴張
Chaos spreads.

1263
01:36:36,125 --> 01:36:37,157
阿波菲斯會毀滅亡者之地的
Apophis shall destroy this land.

1264
01:36:48,770 --> 01:36:50,771
荷魯斯是我們唯一的希望了
Horus is our only hope now.

1265
01:36:50,773 --> 01:36:52,406
他根本不是你想像中的神 薩亞
He's not the god you think he is, zaya.

1266
01:36:52,408 --> 01:36:53,774
他對我撒謊
He lied to me.

1267
01:36:53,776 --> 01:36:55,742
再給他個機會
Give him another chance.

1268
01:36:55,744 --> 01:36:57,511
他都是因為有你幫忙才能走到這一步
He only got this far because of you.

1269
01:36:57,513 --> 01:36:59,746
我的力量不是無限的
My strength is not infinite.

1270
01:36:59,748 --> 01:37:02,783
如果天空神有拯救世界的計劃
If the lord of the air has any plan to rectify this,

1271
01:37:02,785 --> 01:37:04,785
那他最好抓緊了
he should do so with haste.

1272
01:37:04,787 --> 01:37:07,654
如果你不相信他 那就相信我
If you don't trust him, trust me.

1273
01:37:07,656 --> 01:37:09,189
我知道我們會重逢的
I know we'll be together again.

1274
01:37:21,369 --> 01:37:22,669
拉神倒下了
Ra has fallen.

1275
01:37:22,671 --> 01:37:24,571
賽特釋放了混沌
Set has unleashed chaos.

1276
01:37:24,573 --> 01:37:25,506
那我們怎麼阻止他 ?
So how do we stop him?

1277
01:37:28,343 --> 01:37:30,244
你從不放棄 對吧 ?
You never give up, do you?

1278
01:37:30,246 --> 01:37:31,145
那是因為薩亞叫我別放棄
Only because zaya told me not to.

1279
01:37:32,213 --> 01:37:33,514
你沒告訴她我倆的約定 ?
You didn't tell her about our bargain?

1280
01:37:33,516 --> 01:37:35,349
我告訴她了
Yes, I did tell her.

1281
01:37:35,351 --> 01:37:36,583
但不知道為何 她還是相信你
But for some reason, she still believes in you.

1282
01:37:38,620 --> 01:37:40,619
我們必須回首都去
We must return to the capital.

1283
01:37:41,322 --> 01:37:42,389
那我們得走很長一段路了
Then we have a long walk ahead of us.

1284
01:37:45,294 --> 01:37:46,493
我覺得用飛的比較好
I prefer flying.

1285
01:37:50,331 --> 01:37:50,931
奈芙蒂斯
Nephthys.

1286
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:54,301
就算已經死了 她也想幫助我們
Even beyond death, she's trying to help us.

1287
01:38:11,586 --> 01:38:12,886
來吧 惡魔 !
Come, demon!

1288
01:38:40,315 --> 01:38:42,516
賽特拿著拉神的長矛
Set has ra's spear.

1289
01:38:42,518 --> 01:38:43,884
他在引誘阿波菲斯到尼羅河去
He's drawing apophis to the nile,

1290
01:38:43,886 --> 01:38:44,651
生命的源頭
to the source of all life.

1291
01:38:44,653 --> 01:38:46,653
為什麼 ?
Why?

1292
01:38:46,655 --> 01:38:49,957
為了吸乾尼羅河 毀掉世間萬物
To drink it. To destroy all creation.

1293
01:38:49,959 --> 01:38:52,326
拉神還沒死 只有他能阻止這一切
Ra isn't dead. And only he can make this right.

1294
01:38:52,328 --> 01:38:53,994
但他需要自己的長矛
But he needs his spear.

1295
01:38:53,996 --> 01:38:55,329
那我們怎麼搶回來 ?
So how do we get it back?

1296
01:38:56,497 --> 01:38:57,931
看來是時候釣魚了
Maybe it's time we go fishing.

1297
01:39:07,309 --> 01:39:09,643
我效忠於您 我請求您的幫助
I come in your service, I ask for your help.

1298
01:39:09,645 --> 01:39:10,444
建築師
Builder.

1299
01:39:12,914 --> 01:39:14,548
我們有事找你
We have need of you.

1300
01:39:33,001 --> 01:39:36,303
這是最偉大的前無古人後無來者的建築
It is the single greatest architectural achievement

1301
01:39:36,305 --> 01:39:37,671
沒有之一
that ever was and ever will be.

1302
01:39:38,740 --> 01:39:39,706
我的...
My...

1303
01:39:41,342 --> 01:39:45,379
額 賽特大人的方尖碑
I mean, lord set's obelisk

1304
01:39:45,381 --> 01:39:49,850
準確高2200腕尺(約976米)
stands exactly 2,220 cubits tall.

1305
01:39:49,852 --> 01:39:51,652
不多不少
And not a rod off.

1306
01:39:51,654 --> 01:39:53,787
材料為70億塊花崗岩
Built from seven billion blocks of granite,

1307
01:39:53,789 --> 01:39:56,657
50億塊圖拉石灰岩平板
five billion slabs of tura limestone,

1308
01:39:56,659 --> 01:39:58,992
以及900萬塔蘭特金子(2億4300萬公斤)
and nine million talents of gold.

1309
01:39:58,994 --> 01:40:00,594
而又有多少奴隸的性命呢 ?
And the lives of how many slaves?

1310
01:40:01,796 --> 01:40:05,399
5930個
5,930.

1311
01:40:05,401 --> 01:40:06,700
不對 等下
No, wait.

1312
01:40:07,935 --> 01:40:10,437
應該是5931個
Make that 5,931.

1313
01:40:11,839 --> 01:40:13,573
別 你需要他幫你到達塔頂
Don't! You need him to get to the roof.

1314
01:40:16,778 --> 01:40:17,678
頂上見
I'll see you up top.

1315
01:40:48,009 --> 01:40:49,876
你站在他身邊 就好像他是你朋友一樣
You stood beside him as if he were your friend.

1316
01:40:50,978 --> 01:40:52,746
我知道這是什麼感覺
Oh, I know how it feels.

1317
01:40:52,748 --> 01:40:54,514
被神明寵幸
Favor of a god.

1318
01:40:54,516 --> 01:40:56,817
是很讓人陶醉
It's intoxicating.

1319
01:40:56,819 --> 01:40:59,119
真遺憾你追隨錯神了
I'm sorry you picked the wrong one to follow.

1320
01:40:59,121 --> 01:41:00,754
他還有進步空間
He's improving.

1321
01:41:00,756 --> 01:41:02,989
你女人已經死了 不是嗎 ?
Your woman's still dead, isn't she?

1322
01:41:02,991 --> 01:41:06,059
真遺憾 她真是個漂亮妹子
Shame. Such a pretty girl.

1323
01:41:06,061 --> 01:41:07,461
嗯...
Hmm...

1324
01:41:07,463 --> 01:41:09,463
皮膚也很柔軟
Such lovely soft skin.

1325
01:41:13,901 --> 01:41:15,802
足夠通往天堂的財富
Riches for the afterlife.

1326
01:41:17,139 --> 01:41:18,905
看到沒 ? 我已經準備好去死了
You see? I'm ready to die.

1327
01:42:10,625 --> 01:42:12,993
來吧 阿波菲斯 !
Come, apophis!

1328
01:42:38,853 --> 01:42:41,021
你真該待在沙底下的
You should have stayed under the sand.

1329
01:42:41,023 --> 01:42:42,589
我能理解為了王冠而殺人
I can understand killing for a crown,

1330
01:42:42,591 --> 01:42:44,057
但你這樣真是瘋了
but this is madness.

1331
01:42:44,059 --> 01:42:45,592
你當然不明白了
Of course you don't understand.

1332
01:42:45,594 --> 01:42:46,960
你怎麼明白得了 ?
How could you?

1333
01:42:46,962 --> 01:42:48,695
受寵兒子生的受寵兒子
Favored son of a favored son.

1334
01:43:36,578 --> 01:43:38,044
順帶一提
By the way,

1335
01:43:38,046 --> 01:43:40,280
阿波菲斯會吞噬掉亡者之地
apophis is going to eat the land of the dead.

1336
01:43:40,282 --> 01:43:41,748
你是去不了來世了
You'll never make it to the afterlife now.

1337
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:42,516
啥 ?
What?

1338
01:43:50,825 --> 01:43:52,626
現在是誰追隨錯了神明啊 ?
Who picked the wrong god now?

1339
01:44:24,592 --> 01:44:27,561
我以後會挺想念這場叔侄重逢的
I think I may actually miss our little get-togethers.

1340
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:34,734
但你仍然不是我的對手
But you're still no match for me.

1341
01:44:35,736 --> 01:44:36,636
你說得對
You're right.

1342
01:44:38,973 --> 01:44:40,106
我只是個誘餌而已
I'm just the bait.

1343
01:44:46,247 --> 01:44:47,347
而你現在變成了臭蟲
Now you're just becoming a pest.

1344
01:45:05,900 --> 01:45:07,634
荷魯斯 !
Horus!

1345
01:45:49,944 --> 01:45:51,244
難道你不覺得你的眼睛
You don't think your eye might have been

1346
01:45:51,246 --> 01:45:52,779
比一個受傷的小偷更重要嗎 ?
more useful than a wounded thief?

1347
01:45:52,781 --> 01:45:53,913
沒錯
Probably, yes.

1348
01:45:56,884 --> 01:45:58,385
我之前對不起你
I'm sorry for everything I've done to you.

1349
01:46:00,655 --> 01:46:01,955
包括現在
Including this.

1350
01:46:01,957 --> 01:46:02,989
接受了
Accepted.

1351
01:46:33,154 --> 01:46:36,322
我是說過我會偷來另一隻眼
I told you I'd steal your other eye.

1352
01:46:36,324 --> 01:46:37,791
但你應該好心告訴我說
But you could have saved me some trouble

1353
01:46:37,793 --> 01:46:39,159
你並不需要的
and told me you didn't need it.

1354
01:46:39,161 --> 01:46:40,994
拉神給我指了路
Ra showed me the way,

1355
01:46:40,996 --> 01:46:42,328
但我當時沒有聽進去
but I didn't listen.

1356
01:46:42,330 --> 01:46:45,331
我以為是要靠另一隻眼才能變身
I believed I needed my eye to transform,

1357
01:46:45,333 --> 01:46:47,901
但我的旅程並不是不擇手段尋求復仇
but my journey isn't to seek revenge at all costs.

1358
01:46:49,336 --> 01:46:50,937
而是保護我的人民
It is to protect my people.

1359
01:46:52,139 --> 01:46:54,340
別再自我祝賀了
Stop congratulating yourself.

1360
01:46:54,342 --> 01:46:55,475
你還有保護工作要做呢
You've got more protecting to do.

1361
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:23,523
快看 新國王
Behold, the new king.

1362
01:49:25,626 --> 01:49:28,361
我以前認為你是眾神中最偉大的一個
I thought you were the greatest of all the gods.

1363
01:49:28,363 --> 01:49:30,363
瞧瞧你現在這樣子
Now look at you.

1364
01:49:30,365 --> 01:49:32,198
你什麼都沒了
You have nothing.

1365
01:49:32,200 --> 01:49:34,634
我的確是最偉大的神
I am the greatest god.

1366
01:49:35,903 --> 01:49:36,603
我饒過了你一次
I spared you once.

1367
01:49:37,605 --> 01:49:38,938
對吧 ?
Huh?

1368
01:49:38,940 --> 01:49:41,140
我放了你一條生路
I showed you mercy.

1369
01:49:41,142 --> 01:49:42,408
我可不會犯這種錯
I won't make that mistake.

1370
01:50:01,362 --> 01:50:03,162
爺爺 現在還有時間
Grandfather, there's still time.

1371
01:50:08,168 --> 01:50:09,636
夠了 怪物 !
Enough, beast!

1372
01:51:28,282 --> 01:51:29,248
謝謝你
Thank you.

1373
01:51:39,526 --> 01:51:41,728
我們配合真不錯
We make a good team.

1374
01:51:41,730 --> 01:51:43,730
你確定你不是神 ?
Are you sure you're not a god?

1375
01:51:43,732 --> 01:51:46,065
我是什麼神 ?
What would I be the god of?

1376
01:51:47,469 --> 01:51:48,501
愚蠢神 ?
Stupidity?

1377
01:51:50,237 --> 01:51:51,404
奇跡神
The impossible.

1378
01:51:56,310 --> 01:51:57,176
貝克 ?
Bek?

1379
01:52:51,532 --> 01:52:53,499
我從沒欠過任何人任何事
I have never been in debt.

1380
01:52:53,501 --> 01:52:55,435
而我卻欠了你的人情 孫子
And yet I am in debt to you, grandson.

1381
01:52:56,437 --> 01:52:59,338
有什麼要求都可以提
Ask whatever you will.

1382
01:52:59,340 --> 01:53:01,541
大山都會臣服於你面前
Mountains will kneel before you.

1383
01:53:01,543 --> 01:53:03,309
狂風也會遵從你的指示
The winds will do your bidding.

1384
01:53:03,311 --> 01:53:05,445
快點回答 阿波菲斯還沒放棄
Answer quickly, for apophis still hungers.

1385
01:53:06,814 --> 01:53:08,614
而夜晚總會降臨
And night is always coming.

1386
01:53:12,820 --> 01:53:13,853
我什麼也不要
I want nothing.

1387
01:53:16,423 --> 01:53:17,824
除了一件我給予不了的東西
Except what's impossible for me to give.

1388
01:53:44,251 --> 01:53:46,152
我這是...
Am I...

1389
01:53:46,154 --> 01:53:48,121
你回來了
You've returned.

1390
01:53:48,123 --> 01:53:49,789
貝克
Bek?

1391
01:53:49,791 --> 01:53:50,556
幫幫她起身吧
You might want to help her.

1392
01:53:53,327 --> 01:53:54,293
薩亞
Zaya.

1393
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:01,367
貝克
Bek.

1394
01:54:01,369 --> 01:54:02,268
薩亞 ?
Zaya?

1395
01:54:03,670 --> 01:54:04,770
我叫荷魯斯
I'm horus.

1396
01:54:04,772 --> 01:54:06,172
大人
My lord.

1397
01:54:06,174 --> 01:54:07,573
你不是說這是不可能做到的嗎
I thought this was impossible.

1398
01:54:07,575 --> 01:54:09,909
不可能 ? 沒錯
Impossible? Yes.

1399
01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:21,921
拉主神 光之王萬歲 !
Hail ra, lord of light!

1400
01:54:23,824 --> 01:54:26,359
拉主神 光之王萬歲 !
Hail ra, lord of light!

1401
01:54:28,929 --> 01:54:31,831
故事最後智慧被找到了
And so wisdom had been found.

1402
01:54:31,833 --> 01:54:35,168
測驗也被通過了 第二次機會也被賜予了
Tests had been passed. Second chances given.

1403
01:54:35,170 --> 01:54:36,602
重新生活
To live again.

1404
01:54:36,604 --> 01:54:38,671
王國再次團結
To be whole again.

1405
01:54:38,673 --> 01:54:41,541
荷魯斯悼念了他的父母
Horus mourned his parents.

1406
01:54:41,543 --> 01:54:43,843
他們在來世安息
They had long since passed into the afterlife.

1407
01:54:43,845 --> 01:54:46,279
他很清楚是拉神的智慧
But he knew it was the wisdom of ra

1408
01:54:46,281 --> 01:54:49,482
才保證了來世之門的敞開
that the final gate would remain as it had always been.

1409
01:54:49,484 --> 01:54:54,387
一個牢不可破的在人世和永生之間的屏障
An unbreakable barrier between this life and immortality.

1410
01:54:54,389 --> 01:54:55,655
你覺得我準備好沒 ?
You think I'm ready?

1411
01:54:55,657 --> 01:54:58,224
嗯 真正的就緒
Hmm, true readiness

1412
01:54:58,226 --> 01:55:01,661
總所周知是很難做到的
is a notoriously difficult state to achieve.

1413
01:55:01,663 --> 01:55:03,930
不過你也夠接近了
But you're close enough. Hmm.

1414
01:55:16,843 --> 01:55:19,679
起身吧 荷魯斯...
Arise, horus...

1415
01:55:19,681 --> 01:55:22,348
全埃及之王
King of all Egypt.

1416
01:55:31,758 --> 01:55:34,527
從現在開始
From this moment on,

1417
01:55:34,529 --> 01:55:36,429
想進入來世必須努力爭取 不是用黃金
the afterlife must be earned, not with gold,

1418
01:55:37,898 --> 01:55:40,766
而是用善舉 同情心
but by good deeds, compassion,

1419
01:55:41,868 --> 01:55:42,902
以及慷慨
and generosity.

1420
01:55:44,271 --> 01:55:47,840
我們在人世的所作所為都會被當做參考
What we do, how we act in this life matters.

1421
01:55:55,682 --> 01:55:56,816
你在想念她嗎 ?
Are you thinking about her?

1422
01:55:59,419 --> 01:56:00,353
你當然在想了
Of course, you are.

1423
01:56:04,992 --> 01:56:06,525
你該不會認為我把埃及最偉大的財寶弄丟了吧
You didn't think I'd misplace Egypt's greatest treasure?

1424
01:56:08,629 --> 01:56:10,997
你覺得我消失幾天 他們會不會發現 ?
You think they'd miss me if I were gone a few days?

1425
01:56:10,999 --> 01:56:13,332
作為國王的主顧問
As chief advisor to the king,

1426
01:56:13,334 --> 01:56:15,334
我的職責就是讓他們發現不了
it's my duty to ensure they hardly notice.

1427
01:56:15,336 --> 01:56:17,436
但如果有人問到的話...
But if anyone asks...

1428
01:56:17,438 --> 01:56:18,738
那就告訴他們我得去幫一位朋友
Tell them I had to go help a friend.

1429
01:56:21,408 --> 01:56:23,809
埃及暫時交給你管理了
I leave Egypt in your capable hands.
