1
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,406
<i>Few know the whole story.</i>

2
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,281
<i>From what I recall,
it goes something</i> like <i>this...</i>

3
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,802
<i>Before history began,</i>

4
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,770
<i>Egypt was the birthplace of all life.</i>

5
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,362
<i>A paradise worthy of the gods
who</i> created <i>it.</i>

6
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,681
So the <i>gods</i>
decided to live there

7
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,565
alongside <i>their</i>
lesser creation, man.

8
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,321
<i>But there was no mistaking the gods
amongst the mortals who worshipped them.</i>

9
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,803
<i>The gods were taller with gold running
through their veins instead of blood.</i>

10
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,240
<i>And they could transform at will
into</i> all manner <i>of frightening beasts.</i>

11
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,480
<i>Egypt itself was divided
between two mighty brothers.</i>

12
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,769
<i>Osiris, the God of Life,
was the beloved king</i>

13
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,888
<i>of all the lands
made bountiful</i> by <i>the Nile.</i>

14
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,525
His brother, Set,
ruled the far barren desert

15
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,128
<i>finding both strength
and bitterness in his isolation.</i>

16
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,443
<i>But then the time came
for Osiris to</i> crown a <i>new</i> king.

17
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,490
<i>His only son, Horus.</i>

18
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,927
<i>It was</i> a <i>decision that would
test the brothers'</i> bond

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,241
<i>and the fate of all Egypt.</i>

20
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,322
<i>But the gods are only half our tale.</i>

21
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,010
<i>It had become clear that they couldn't</i>
shape <i>the</i> course <i>of destiny alone.</i>

22
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,086
<i>A man of exceptional judgment,
wisdom and fortitude would</i> be <i>needed.</i>

23
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,085
<i>Unfortunately, I was not such a man.</i>

24
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,370
<i>But</i> before you dismiss
my younger foolhardy self, remember...

25
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,049
<i>Never doubt</i> a <i>man fighting for the one</i>
thing <i>as powerful as</i> any <i>god.</i>

26
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,565
Three hundred, impossible.

27
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,641
Love.

28
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,450
Thief!

29
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,565
Stop!

30
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,166
This dress is hopeless.
I need to buy some ribbon to even begin

31
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,447
to make it suitable
for the coronation.

32
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,682
I say we spend tomorrow
together instead.

33
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,764
We are spending tomorrow together.
At the coronation.

34
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,121
We're blessed the gods shall give us
a new king in our lifetime.

35
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,531
Horus?

36
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,409
You know I couldn't care less
about the gods.

37
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,891
Well, they care about you.

38
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,930
- Oh, yeah?
- Bek! Give it back.

39
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,168
I knew you wanted
to wear something special.

40
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,569
Did you steal it from a shopkeeper
or from someone's closet?

41
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,530
It was quicker than waiting
for the gods to answer my prayers.

42
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,568
The gods give us
everything we need.

43
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,723
Yes. Their generosity knows no bounds.

44
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,923
You look beautiful.

45
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,767
Zaya, when I asked you
to run away with me,

46
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,683
I promised you a good life.

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,890
Dresses worthy of a princess.
A new one every day.

48
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,928
Rivers of jewels to adorn you.

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,005
- A golden palace to raise our family.
- And how many children would we have?

50
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,760
A dozen.

51
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,807
I would do anything
to make you happy.

52
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,965
<i>And</i> how was Horus, <i>the</i>
king-to-be, preparing for his great day?

53
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,807
Lord of the Air.

54
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,168
Quite an occasion last night.

55
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,005
Already crowds press cheek-to-cheek
to catch a glimpse of you.

56
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,326
You will look splendid.

57
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,688
Eventually.

58
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,050
<i>♪ Glorious, glorious Horus! ♪</i>

59
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,646
But <i>don't</i> discount
Horus yet either.

60
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,401
<i>Because when it comes to the fate
of the world in one's</i> hands,

61
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,484
<i>even gods can be surprised
by the strength they possess.</i>

62
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,406
If I was to be crowned,
I might have spent the preceding hours

63
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,050
composing a message for my people.

64
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,929
Could the people love him more?

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,571
Maybe Lord Horus doesn't think
we need boring speeches.

66
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,608
Except when it comes
to toasting his own glory.

67
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,762
Many toasts were required.

68
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,127
I was doing deeds
of which songs will be sung.

69
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,567
The great lion he slayed
was terrorizing villages.

70
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,122
It was? Good.
All the more song-worthy.

71
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,244
That's nice.

72
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,004
That's fine, thank...

73
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,886
You.

74
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,361
A shame I've come too late.

75
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,048
But here I am, sober and clothed.
Don't tell anyone.

76
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,487
I have a bad reputation to keep.

77
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,168
Come here. Come.

78
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,401
No. No, no. No, no!

79
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,769
Hard to believe,
but you look like a king.

80
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,002
If that's what excites you,
who am I to judge?

81
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,491
Jewelry excites me.

82
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,326
Then look to your wrist,
if the effort is not too great.

83
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,881
The Bracelet of 42 Stars.

84
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,440
To remind you of the demons
I slayed for you.

85
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,807
A more valuable treasure
Egypt has never known.

86
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,325
This old thing?

87
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,006
How can the Goddess of Love
not know what love is?

88
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,086
It's not bedding any girl who flutters
her eyelashes, mighty lion-slayer.

89
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,403
I was celebrating the hunt.
You would know that had you been here.

90
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,529
I value my freedom.
Dead animals less so.

91
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,170
Well, you have no
problem wearing them.

92
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,243
- Oh...
- Hathor, don't.

93
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,766
Don't.

94
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,009
That's no way for
a queen to behave.

95
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,481
Then it's a good thing
I'm not a queen.

96
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,564
Can you imagine anything more dull
than sitting on a throne all day?

97
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,768
What exactly are you asking me?

98
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,121
Did I ask you something?

99
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,405
I'm not sure. Did you?

100
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,407
My Lord.

101
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,241
It's starting.

102
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,129
Hathor, Goddess of Love!

103
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,920
Nephthys, Goddess of Protection!

104
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,730
- Sir.
- Oh...

105
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,007
Thank you, young man.

106
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,085
You've been awfully nice to
strangers today. Show me your hands.

107
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,446
- What? Gifts for Osiris.
- Hurry up!

108
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,240
Thoth, God of Wisdom!

109
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,169
Greetings, Thoth.

110
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,402
Did you ever imagine
that your former student

111
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,482
would one day wear
the crown of Egypt?

112
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,244
Horus evinced a range of attributes,

113
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,130
some of which may well correlate
with a leadership position.

114
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,441
If he's lucky.

115
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,721
Praise Osiris!

116
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,286
King of all Egypt!

117
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,604
Hail Ra, Lord of Light.

118
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,571
Hail Ra, Lord of Light!

119
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,769
My father has seen
fit to bless this day

120
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,162
as you all bless us
with your generosity.

121
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,400
A token from someone with much.

122
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,290
And from someone with little.

123
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,922
But when both die
and stand at the Final Gate,

124
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,241
what is their value then?

125
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,770
I say they are equal.
Symbols of lives well-lived.

126
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,207
All are welcome to the Afterlife.

127
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,923
This is my legacy.

128
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,570
But today, we crown a new king.

129
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,564
And one day, he will have
a legacy of his own.

130
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,849
My son Horus, Lord of the Air.

131
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,041
Are you ready?

132
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,241
I am.

133
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,561
Wait!

134
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,209
Wait. Sorry, I'm late.

135
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,124
Ugh, three days to cross the desert.

136
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,771
And nearly one more to pass
through all your admirers.

137
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,006
Set!

138
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,846
- Brother. Good to see you.
- And you, brother.

139
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,843
There's always
a place for you here.

140
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,844
Such a big day for the family.
You must be proud.

141
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,605
I am.

142
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,729
Look at you, nephew. Magnificent.

143
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,808
At least someone
here'll make a fine king.

144
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,850
- I was afraid you wouldn't come.
- No, I wouldn't miss it.

145
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,126
Ah.

146
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,962
- For you.
- Oh...

147
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,763
A hunting horn.

148
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,641
From the skull of a ram that flattened
ten gods slower than me.

149
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,960
It's beautiful.

150
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,849
Yeah? Try it out.

151
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,240
From Set.

152
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,769
Come on!
Let Ra himself hear you.

153
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,002
I think someone heard you.

154
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,285
What is this, Set?

155
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,204
You recognize it?

156
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,364
Father gave it to you.

157
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,963
Kept me alive for many
a night in the desert.

158
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,649
Fight me.

159
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,802
- Father, don't.
- Stay out of this, son.

160
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,080
Why?

161
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,370
In 1,000 years of peace,
what have you accomplished?

162
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,683
A land of people
who dream of nothing more.

163
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,843
- It's my turn now.
- I won't fight.

164
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,761
I love you, brother.
With all my heart.

165
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,170
I love you, too, brother.

166
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,286
No!

167
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,205
Osiris!

168
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,610
Well, this truly is
a big day for the family.

169
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:17,649
I, Set...
shall be your one true king.

170
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,680
King of all Egypt!

171
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,924
Behold the fate
of those who stand in my way.

172
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,560
Gods...

173
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,886
Bow before me or die.

174
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,249
Mortals, worship me
or be enslaved!

175
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,526
Bek!

176
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,888
My brother thought
the Afterlife was a gift.

177
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,367
I think a king should
have higher standards.

178
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,367
From now on, you have to buy your way
in with riches earned.

179
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,564
Your journey has just begun.

180
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,009
It's yours now.

181
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,680
Many of us will stand with you,
but now is not the time.

182
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,368
- I looked up to you.
- Of course you did.

183
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,524
That would be unwise.

184
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,449
Is it true you still never miss?
Doesn't that get dull?

185
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,204
I thought your sight was perfect.

186
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,965
You fight well.
Are you so sure you're his son?

187
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,126
Zaya!

188
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,968
" Bek!"
- Zaya!

189
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,087
Bek!

190
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,563
I'm doing Egypt a favor.
You're not fit to be King.

191
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,441
No!

192
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,121
No!

193
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,481
Set!

194
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,564
Forgive me, Father.

195
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,001
Zaya!

196
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,091
Zaya!

197
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,331
<i>And so Set was King.</i>

198
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,522
<i>In the year that followed,</i>
many <i>gods stood against</i> him.

199
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,491
One <i>by</i> one,
they paid with their lives.

200
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,801
<i>For mortals, things were worse.</i>

201
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,203
Most were forced into slavery,
and denied even the tiniest penny

202
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,045
<i>to buy our way into the Afterlife.</i>

203
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,330
<i>Blinded and defeated,
Horus withdrew into exile.</i>

204
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,246
<i>Those who prayed for him to save Egypt
were sorely disappointed.</i>

205
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,770
<i>But I was never much for prayer.</i>

206
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,684
<i>I</i> had <i>found</i> Zaya
enslaved to a cruel master.

207
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,964
<i>But how could I free her from all this?</i>

208
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,691
<i>It was the maddest of all plans.</i>

209
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,527
You may not control the wind, Zaya,
but I'd think you could close a shutter.

210
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,881
Sorry, My Lord.

211
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,083
Pretty one, if ever I find
my desk disordered again,

212
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,323
I'll throw you outside to push stone.
ls that clear?

213
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,848
Come on, come on!
Haven't got all day.

214
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,602
I'd like to drop him
from a great height.

215
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,284
Morning.

216
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,728
One day, I'm going to steal
you away from him.

217
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,086
Is theft always the answer?

218
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,811
It is now in this world.
You're either rich or nothing.

219
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,810
Even if you could free me,
what about my family? Our friends?

220
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,127
Can you steal all Egypt
away from Set?

221
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,407
Only Horus can free us.

222
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,324
- You really believe the gods care?
- If Horus could come, he would.

223
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,806
I want to show you something.

224
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,686
Set's army returns with spoils of war.

225
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,330
His vault will be unlocked tonight.

226
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,846
The perfect time
for someone to sneak inside.

227
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,729
Why?

228
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,689
They say Horus' eyes
are kept there.

229
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,205
He would have his power again.

230
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,486
Steal from a god?

231
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,211
Only a madman would try such a thing.

232
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,567
Where do you suppose
we could find someone so mad?

233
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,644
The plans should be here.

234
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,200
Urshu built the vault.
He's Set's architect.

235
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,646
What's this?

236
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,927
Uh, Set's pyramid of sand.

237
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,402
He's built himself
quite the fire pit.

238
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,323
He must cook massive feasts.

239
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,368
It's the pit to the center
of the world.

240
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,330
The source of his power. No feasts.

241
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,926
Found it.

242
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,047
The treasure will pass
through the front gate.

243
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,246
The front gate
isn't the problem.

244
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,044
It's what comes after.

245
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,886
Two bridges rigged with traps.
Urshu boasts of them endlessly.

246
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,326
Good thing I'm cheating.

247
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,970
Welcome me properly, soldier.

248
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,806
Don't keep
the Queen of Egypt waiting.

249
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,687
<i>I think you missed me.</i>

250
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,651
I have to miss you.
I'm your prisoner, after all.

251
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,281
- Oh, this prison's not so bad.
- Well, I'm miserable.

252
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,329
You have a funny way of showing it.

253
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,767
Can I borrow your knife?

254
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,289
So if you had the chance, you'd kill me?

255
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,324
How could I kill you?

256
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,290
But you would if you could.

257
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,248
Better keep your eyes open.

258
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,686
Lord Set.

259
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,446
Oh...

260
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,768
And, uh... Mistress.

261
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,528
Perhaps I might
come at a better time.

262
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,329
No, come in. Don't be shy.

263
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,281
Come on.

264
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,371
No one has ever so honored
the great God Ra.

265
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,841
He will pass
over its peak and marvel

266
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,968
at the tribute you have
built in his name.

267
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,002
Is that it?

268
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,081
I'm sorry?

269
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,202
Well, can you make it any taller?

270
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,126
- Taller?
- Yes, it's a simple question.

271
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,805
Well, that might be difficult, um,
now, I mean...

272
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,446
Relax, Urshu. I'm joking.

273
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:18,451
Tell me, Why'd your father
choose you to be master builder

274
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,761
rather than one of your brothers?

275
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,002
I suppose because I proved
to be the best, My Lord.

276
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,924
As I shall prove
to be the best to my father.

277
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,887
He shall see it from dawn to dusk.

278
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,962
Your satisfaction
is worth more than gold.

279
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,849
Oh, gold, gold!

280
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,840
You'll have plenty enough
gold for the Afterlife.

281
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,166
A toast!

282
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,242
To Egypt's greatest builder.

283
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,321
A toast to my legacy.

284
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,048
Whoa!

285
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,362
Where do you even
get that many scorpions?

286
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,048
Enough to make you afraid
of your own shadow.

287
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,887
"The circle is the trigger."

288
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,845
So I'll go 'round.

289
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,962
Well, that was easy.

290
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,890
A third bridge.

291
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,730
Doesn't say anything about
a third bridge.

292
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,404
This is criminal.

293
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,131
And only one eye.

294
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,689
Terrific.

295
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,446
Zaya, you'd say a prayer,
I'll roll the bones.

296
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,487
Zaya!

297
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,284
I'm so sorry.

298
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,603
As if using my house for your
fornicating were not sufficient...

299
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,683
You dare steal from the King?

300
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,607
I pride myself
in an orderly office, Zaya.

301
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,568
You never did
understand that, did you?

302
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,008
Oh, and this pathetic little
trinket of yours

303
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,809
will save neither of you, I'm afraid.

304
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,370
Set is your god.

305
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,010
- It was all my idea.
- Liar!

306
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,530
Give me back what you took.

307
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,126
Thank you.

308
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,402
- Feed them to the jackals.
- Wait!

309
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,880
I took something else.

310
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,809
<i>'</i> Run!

311
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,685
Hee-ya!

312
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,369
You did it.
Where's the other?

313
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,644
You know how hard it was
to steal that one?

314
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,051
- I'll love you forever.
- Zaya.

315
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,963
Death is not the end.

316
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,770
Zaya.

317
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,083
Whoa.

318
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,245
I'll make it right, Zaya.

319
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,408
I don't need any more worshippers.

320
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,411
Tributes that rot and stink.

321
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,005
Unless you brought
more wine, get out.

322
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,324
I'm no worshipper.

323
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,367
What are you?
Some thief?

324
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,167
Yes. A thief.

325
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,362
I have something
Set took from you.

326
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,321
No mortal could rob Set's vault.

327
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,409
You pilfered one of my
followers' corpses.

328
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,007
- They never even got close.
- Give them to me.

329
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,970
- Not yet.
- Give me my eyes.

330
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,681
- I have a proposition.
- You bargain with me?

331
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,569
You're lucky I'm willing to.

332
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,483
You can't strike
a three-legged elephant.

333
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,721
You want a reward, I suppose?
Gold?

334
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,450
Gold I can steal.

335
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,970
There's someone I want saved.

336
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,765
From what?

337
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,920
Death.

338
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,643
Didn't your father teach
that death isn't the end?

339
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,051
It can't be done.

340
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,251
Well, figure it out.
You're Horus, Lord of the Air!

341
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,970
Or maybe I'll just toss
what I have in the Nile.

342
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,161
Wait.

343
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,960
<i>Stay with the living.</i>

344
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,883
Stay with the living.

345
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,601
Stay with the living.

346
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,920
She's gone beyond where I can reach her.

347
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,243
- But you're a god.
- Gods may live 1,000 of your years,

348
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,163
but we cannot cure mortality.

349
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,764
It's time for her
to walk the path.

350
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,841
There must be
something you can do.

351
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,206
I've done all I can.

352
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,248
Oh, thou who art everlasting,

353
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,130
send your servant to guide
the dead to new life.

354
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,490
Anubis, come forth.

355
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,605
You are released.

356
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,649
The doors of Earth
are open to you.

357
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,611
- You must begin your journey.
- She died a slave.

358
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,120
Without treasure, she won't be allowed
through the Final Gate.

359
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,248
What do you offer?

360
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,368
She can't pass into the Afterlife.

361
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,727
For you, Lord Anubis,

362
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,201
Governor of the Bows,
who is upon his mountain,

363
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,802
I have only my smile.

364
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,249
So be it.

365
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,446
Zaya!

366
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,725
Zaya!

367
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,290
The dead don't speak to the living.

368
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,124
Stay on the path.

369
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,366
Now give them to me.

370
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,961
- You've done nothing!
- My eyes.

371
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,247
Spend the rest of your days
wandering around sightless.

372
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,810
I have nothing to lose.
Do you understand?

373
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,644
Give me my eyes.

374
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,250
I will do anything to see
her again or I'll die trying.

375
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,961
You want to hide from me?
Learn to talk less.

376
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,329
Here.

377
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,450
Where's the other?

378
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,369
Where's the other?

379
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,204
Well, I'm not exactly sure, but I...

380
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,611
I'll snap your neck.

381
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,521
You must hate Set for what
he did to your father.

382
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,925
The pyramid.

383
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,843
I know how to get into
Set's pyramid.

384
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,051
How?

385
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,331
How?

386
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,851
Oh...

387
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,324
It's where he keeps
his power locked up, right?

388
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,801
If I could get you inside,
could you kill him?

389
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,530
How would you do that?

390
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,610
- I saw the plans.
- Tell me.

391
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,727
- I'll show you.
- Go on.

392
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,131
If you bring Zaya back.

393
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,325
There may be a way.

394
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,931
No one may leave
the Afterlife once entered.

395
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,365
But the journey
through the Nine Gates

396
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,283
will take several days to complete.

397
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,367
And only the King
can make Anubis turn back.

398
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,009
If I kill Set
and take back the crown

399
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,447
before your beloved
reaches the Final Gate,

400
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,845
I might be able to save her.

401
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,840
Try to keep up.

402
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,281
My magnificent bloody hounds.

403
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:14,161
You are the true sons of Egypt.

404
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,920
You are my children
of iron and blood.

405
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,280
No father could be more proud.

406
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,611
The rebel gods
have choked on our spears.

407
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,291
The rest have retreated
to Nephthys' stronghold

408
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,045
where they now stand
ready to face us.

409
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:35,251
But you, my legions of the desert,
will bring them reckoning!

410
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,131
So take your fill of gold!

411
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,010
And if you should fall in battle
and travel the Nine Gates,

412
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,129
tell my brother
who it is you worship!

413
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,603
Division Set!
Amarn! Ta! Rai! Fall in!

414
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,000
Forward march!

415
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,281
My Lord.

416
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,321
Your royal treasury
has been breached.

417
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,451
Urshu...

418
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,727
Wasn't the eye meant to lure
those loyal to Horus to their deaths?

419
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,851
Yes, Lord.

420
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,161
And weren't your traps...

421
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,525
What was the term you used?

422
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,131
Thief-proof?

423
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,171
Yes, Lord.

424
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,045
Can you pick up the trail?

425
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,565
I'll find him.

426
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,051
And find whichever of his allies

427
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,124
was clever enough
to steal back his eye.

428
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,405
It was a mortal, Lord.

429
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,805
A mortal?

430
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,327
Who is she?

431
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,765
His servant.

432
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,683
In my defense, Lord...

433
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,604
Believe me, I'm very curious
to hear what your excuse is.

434
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,841
But not right now.

435
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,160
Yes, Lord.

436
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,171
Well, it appears you're not
the cleverest mortal in Egypt after all.

437
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,571
This thief is.

438
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,324
So what is your plan?

439
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,041
To kill the God of the Desert,
we must kill the desert itself.

440
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,089
Kill the desert?

441
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,925
How do you kill the desert?

442
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,123
We must go to my grandfather's.

443
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,370
- He'll help us with our task.
- Your grandfather?

444
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,562
You mean Ra?
The Sun God, Ra?

445
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,683
So where exactly is your grandfather?

446
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,850
You're being funny, right?

447
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,241
You think I'd put any effort
into trying to amuse you?

448
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,962
It seems flying
would be useful right now.

449
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,963
Without both my eyes,
I cannot transform.

450
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,491
I need to pray for strength.

451
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,280
Oh, that's not encouraging.

452
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,761
Be silent Or you'll reach
the bottom of this mountain

453
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,320
much quicker
than you reached the top.

454
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,408
Great Ra, know my name.

455
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,124
The Lord of the Air seeks your embrace.

456
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,643
Grandfather, I need your help. Please!

457
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,921
Impressed!

458
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,565
Stay in my shadow.

459
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,804
- Why?
- Just do as I say.

460
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,008
Hail, thou Great God Ra.

461
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:42,363
Normally, when a bird lands on my boat,
I kill it before it can shit.

462
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,806
What is this? You dare bring a mortal
to the source of Creation?

463
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,087
He's valuable to me.
I could not leave him behind.

464
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,767
Ah.
Why have you come?

465
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,285
I would only ask
something of you.

466
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,691
Oh, in that case,

467
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,765
I shall stop what I'm doing
and heed your bidding.

468
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,600
Grandfather, I'm sorry.
I mean no disrespect.

469
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,290
You don't know the difference.

470
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,121
Stay there. Be quiet.

471
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,569
I have work to do.

472
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,491
And put the mortal below deck
if you want him to live.

473
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,321
Crawl back to shadow,
you stinking worm!

474
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:05,007
You shall never feast
on my creation!

475
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,925
Try as you might.

476
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,929
Things would be different
if I could dwell

477
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,401
amongst my children
in the garden of the Nile.

478
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,451
It is my burden to fight
the demon Apophis night after night.

479
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,330
Egypt must never be
destroyed by Chaos.

480
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:28,042
So, you see,
there are things worse than Set.

481
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,085
You're wrong.

482
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,811
That demon isn't the one
who murdered my father.

483
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,043
- Murdered your son.
- They are both my sons.

484
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,090
They were both equal in my eyes.
As is all of my creation.

485
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,403
And the uncertainty
of its destiny is my will.

486
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,970
So what is it actually
that brings you here?

487
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,321
Allow me to fill my flask
with these waters.

488
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,003
The waters are not mine.

489
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,565
You plan to quench the desert fire.

490
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,483
To kill Set.
To become King as your father wished.

491
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:39,610
- Grant me the power to fly again.
- I heard your prayer the first time.

492
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,206
I let you come here
and I grant you passage home.

493
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,443
But after that?

494
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:48,809
Without both my eyes,
I doubt I'm strong enough to beat Set.

495
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,370
So become stronger.

496
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,929
Have you been so lazy for so long

497
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,083
that you've forgotten
every god's life is a journey?

498
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,687
When you stray from your path,
you grow weak.

499
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,444
Hey!

500
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,124
Why are you
lugging around this mortal?

501
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,969
He had the gall to strike
a bargain with me.

502
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,731
Ah.

503
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,846
Not worth the papyrus
it's written on, hmm?

504
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,844
What does it matter?
He is but a mortal.

505
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,720
I do not approve
of how Set rules.

506
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,326
But I'm uncertain
you would be much better.

507
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,923
Lord, the last of the rebel gods
have retreated behind her walls.

508
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,566
Every last one?

509
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,770
Yes, sir.

510
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,411
Good. Then they're ripe
for the picking.

511
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,520
Isn't this a bit excessive?

512
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,562
She'd want them to fight
to the death anyway.

513
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,488
- She was your wife.
- All the more reason to kill her.

514
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,767
From now on,
this will be the way of things.

515
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,251
Our way.

516
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,365
Better get used to it.

517
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:15,166
Is it right that a goddess
should perform such labor?

518
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:20,322
Since you became King, the need
for burial shrouds has been great.

519
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,130
- You could have been a queen.
- You should know why I could not.

520
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:31,967
Then, when I asked you
to marry me, why did you say yes?

521
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,646
I remember when you
rode out of the desert.

522
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:39,365
Impetuous. Dashing. So handsome.

523
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,283
I braved those stinging winds
just to be at your side.

524
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,723
And imagined the great deeds
we would accomplish together.

525
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,609
It didn't all sting.

526
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:54,728
- Some parts were sweet.
- Perhaps.

527
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,201
I still thought
we could have been happy.

528
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,048
I should have been enough
to fulfill you.

529
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,682
Nothing can fulfill me.

530
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:13,409
That's why Ra was wise to ensure
you would never have a child.

531
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,361
Why?

532
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,330
No one will know, until it's too late.

533
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,451
Maybe next time, keep flying
until we're actually on the ground.

534
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,086
What Ra gave, he took back.

535
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,330
- I thought he was helping you.
- I got what I needed.

536
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,444
The whole of the Nile
cannot quench Set's fire.

537
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,887
But a few drops from
the water of Creation can.

538
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,610
Kill the desert.

539
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,411
With his fire gone,
Set will be weakened.

540
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,720
Vulnerable.

541
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,404
What would happen if I drank that?

542
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:33,046
You would be refreshed.
Then you would die.

543
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,408
It doesn't seem right that the water
of Creation would kill.

544
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,165
I would kill you.
For wasting my water.

545
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,968
What's this?

546
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,964
So you don't have to bring me something
to drink cupped in your hands.

547
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,363
I'm not your slave.

548
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,927
My father taught me it's unworthy
of a god to strike a man.

549
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,844
He should have taught you to get off
your ass and get your own water.

550
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,325
Sorry, Father.

551
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,443
This is becoming unacceptable.

552
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,164
Where is the Eye of Horus?

553
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,130
Up your behind, alongside the goats
you keep up there.

554
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,451
Where is the Eye of Horus?

555
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,650
Right here.

556
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:43,608
I thought you were crawling
sightless in the mud somewhere.

557
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,889
Cut him down!

558
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:01,602
See, brothers?
Without his other eye, he is weak.

559
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:56,689
Even if I were blind, deaf,
bereft of limbs...

560
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,324
You're still no match for me.

561
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,767
You'll be glad to know
I didn't fall to my death.

562
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,171
Praise Ra.

563
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,571
The deal doesn't count if I die.

564
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,405
The whole point is for Zaya
and I both to be here, together.

565
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,641
Breathing!

566
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,686
Behind you!

567
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,206
Horus!

568
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,486
Horus!

569
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,967
Oh, Ra, dear Ra, please, help us!

570
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,370
Horus!

571
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,369
We are going to die!

572
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,170
After you.

573
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,289
- Are you sure you can do this?
- I saved you, didn't I?

574
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,840
- Oh, you saved me?
- Only because you're useful to me.

575
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,844
You know what would be useful?
Your other eye.

576
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,525
I could steal it back for you,
if you like.

577
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,045
Don't test my patience, mortal.

578
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,731
My name is not "mortal."

579
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,531
What is it, then?

580
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:32,966
Bek.

581
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,728
Very well, Bek.

582
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,484
The roads will be watched now.

583
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,244
Set will send better hunters.

584
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,891
Well, that didn't go
according to plan, did it?

585
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,008
No, Lord.

586
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:59,163
My nephew did all this
with one eye?

587
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:02,687
- I underestimated his strength.
- Tough to kill, that boy.

588
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,445
Like his uncle.

589
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:09,044
Where's he going?
Who's he allying with?

590
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:12,647
- His only ally is the mortal.
- It's hardly an army, is it?

591
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,085
I overheard them.

592
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,766
The mortal spoke of a bargain
he'd made with Horus.

593
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,611
This is one ambitious mortal.

594
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:23,730
Horus has agreed to bring the mortal's
woman back from death.

595
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,051
Are you sure?

596
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,884
I'm certain of it, Lord.

597
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,003
You should really get that attended to.

598
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,368
- Yes, Lord. Thank you.
- Good job.

599
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,450
You should have trusted us
with this from the start.

600
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,761
Haven't we always left you satisfied?

601
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,683
Then satisfy me again.

602
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,365
Did you let your wife live?

603
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:09,042
Sooner or later, you and I
will end up just the same.

604
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:23,005
The Land of the Dead
and its Nine Gates.

605
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,810
Is it accurate,
Mistress of the West?

606
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,407
Don't call me that.
I left all that behind.

607
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,847
Soon, I will rule all the world.

608
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,806
The Land of the Dead
is the final kingdom left standing.

609
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,769
You want things you can't have.

610
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,690
- I want you to take me there.
- But you're a living soul.

611
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,685
Yes. And you were a living soul, too,
when you were counselor to the dead.

612
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,480
You know what's waiting
for me if I go back.

613
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:53,525
You have your little bracelet
to protect you from those demons.

614
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,170
It's not that.

615
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,049
You miss it. Don't you?

616
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,571
The darkness.
What it brought out in you.

617
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,165
No.

618
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:08,131
Ah, you're not so good,
Goddess of Love.

619
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,604
- I know.
- Then do this.

620
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:16,208
Prove your loyalty to me.
Then we can have everything.

621
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,125
Together.

622
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,285
Horus...

623
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,210
My love.

624
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,969
<i>Horus...</i>

625
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,922
You're not in your father's tomb?

626
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,129
I was wondering where he was.

627
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:55,289
Now I know. Thanks.

628
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,650
For someone who bends
the will of men by batting her lashes,

629
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,165
you're not very clever.

630
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,051
- How long has he had his sight?
- Why do you care?

631
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:15,090
I'm yours now.
I'll do as you've asked.

632
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,488
Even if I kill Horus?

633
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,323
Of course.

634
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,767
Who cares about him?

635
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:28,761
I'd have thought you'd be exhausted
from so much lying.

636
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:42,130
I loved Nephthys once,
and I took her wings.

637
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,284
Imagine what I'll do to you.

638
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,728
Do that and I'll hunt you down.

639
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,645
Let me touch.

640
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,968
I suppose it's better than running.

641
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,930
Can we find a less unpleasant
campsite next time?

642
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:52,881
Hmm.

643
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,321
This used to be a garden
like you've never seen.

644
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,925
What happened?

645
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,360
It was my father's first temple.

646
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,124
In his generosity,
he opened the grounds

647
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,123
so the poor could bury
their own here.

648
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,886
Set has corrupted his teachings.

649
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,522
My father loved this place.

650
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,042
So Set brought him here to be butchered.

651
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,324
His body was cut into 14 pieces.

652
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,811
The heart was never found.

653
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:46,408
- Set salted the earth?
- No. It was my mother's tears.

654
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,409
Before she took her own life.

655
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,084
I failed them.

656
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,125
I'm sorry.

657
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:59,204
Ra told me I was on a journey.

658
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:04,729
And if I reach the end,
I will be mighty again.

659
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,644
- How does it end?
- With vengeance.

660
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:13,127
Ends with my spear
through Set's skull.

661
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:17,730
Is that a storm?

662
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,483
There's no clouds.

663
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,727
Set's hunters riding their pets.

664
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,690
Those aren't pets. A cat is a pet.

665
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,081
I can't withstand their venom.
Not as I am now.

666
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,605
Then I guess we should run.

667
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,206
- Run?
- Mortals do it all the time!

668
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,964
- Run faster!
- I can't!

669
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:01,844
- Run faster!
- I can't!

670
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,760
Come on!

671
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,328
- We have to kill them.
- "We"?

672
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,368
When you go fishing,
what's most important?

673
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:32,044
- I don't fish.
- It's the quality of the bait.

674
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:35,010
- It's too dangerous.
- Are you worried about me?

675
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:37,731
No, it's just my aim with a spear
is not what it was.

676
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,245
Then get closer before you throw it.

677
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,606
Hey! Beautiful!

678
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,409
I meant the snake!

679
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:30,967
That worked great. Let's go again.

680
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:33,566
This time, the bait
needs to dangle longer.

681
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,240
I must strike the weak spot from behind.

682
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,611
And how do you know
they have a weak spot?

683
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:38,125
I don't. But they must, right?

684
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,406
<i>'</i> Go!

685
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,882
Excellent! You've made it angry.

686
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:25,207
Too bad you can no longer fly.

687
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,764
Neither can you.

688
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,006
You!

689
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,442
Just shut up and stay out of my way.

690
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:20,128
Pretty girl, you don't belong in battle.

691
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,250
Burn her!

692
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:29,651
What a lovely creature you are.

693
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,249
Let me help you.

694
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,488
Burn her!

695
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:40,526
You are so very cold.

696
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:44,526
Warm yourself. I command you.

697
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:54,966
Quickly.

698
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,044
Your company was preferable.

699
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:16,960
Outrageous!

700
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,530
You're welcome
for saving your life.

701
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,090
So while I was sitting blind
in my father's tomb,

702
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,811
you shared a bed with the god
who pulled out my eyes.

703
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,451
Why would I waste this
on someone who can't see?

704
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,204
Why would I ever
trust you again?

705
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,965
He's slaying all the gods
who won't bow to him.

706
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,724
That includes me.

707
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:35,249
We're breaking into Set's temple.
Horus is going to kill him.

708
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:36,765
How were you planning to get in?

709
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:38,761
Him?

710
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,524
He's seen the plans. He knows the way.

711
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,722
What about the Sphinx?
Have you forgotten about that?

712
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:46,566
- Sphinx?
- Set captured it to guard his fire.

713
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:50,406
It will kill mercilessly all who enter
if they cannot answer its riddle.

714
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,811
You can answer the riddle, right?

715
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,928
We shall ask Thoth for help.

716
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,401
Why would you ever
do that on purpose?

717
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:00,371
So we won't have to die any sooner
than is absolutely necessary. Let's go.

718
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,690
Did he give you that dress?

719
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:16,409
I chose from what was provided.

720
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,165
So you chose the one you thought
would please him the most.

721
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:21,083
- I dress to please myself.
- Hmm.

722
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:23,128
Why? You don't like it?

723
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,089
It's too much.

724
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:27,640
I'm the Goddess of Too Much.

725
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:31,122
And there's plenty I've given you
you've never found excessive.

726
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,683
- Ah.
- Now it's maybe too little.

727
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:37,240
You never used to be so hard to please.

728
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,890
You're slowing us down.

729
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:40,321
Ooh.

730
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,442
I think it makes you look roguish.

731
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:47,284
What did I look like before?

732
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,203
- Oblivious.
- Oh!

733
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:51,760
- But in a cute way.
- Oblivious of what?

734
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,963
Exactly. You always did
take me for granted.

735
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:56,246
What?

736
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,448
With your eye back,
you should have come to get me.

737
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,363
- Oh?
- Don't I mean enough to you?

738
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:17,086
Be a dear and fetch me some clean water.

739
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:21,690
Would it kill you to say "please"?

740
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:24,684
I'm really not in the mood to argue.

741
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:29,926
Go get it for me. I command you.

742
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,604
You're all the same, aren't you?

743
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:35,404
What's her name?

744
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:39,847
I can make any man, woman,
god or beast do my bidding.

745
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:42,082
Unless their heart belongs to another.

746
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,204
You're in love.

747
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,049
Her name's... Zaya.

748
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:54,929
I'm so sorry.

749
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:04,882
I promised her a proper home.

750
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,928
Money for a family.
Respectability.

751
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,401
I gave her nothing.

752
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:11,847
Oh, she wouldn't have been with you
if she didn't love you.

753
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:14,566
- Believe me, I know.
- I'm going to make it up to her.

754
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:15,801
But I thought she...

755
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,651
- Horus is going to bring her back.
- He said that?

756
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,245
I know it's hard to see past his

757
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,721
short temper and proclamations
of revenge but...

758
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,210
He's not so bad.

759
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:27,290
It is hard to see.

760
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:37,730
There it is.

761
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,006
Is that him?

762
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:12,887
- Them?
- Of course not.

763
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,041
Then who are they?

764
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:16,248
His trusted servants.

765
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,609
He only trusts himself.

766
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:20,808
Rich with generous compost.

767
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,008
Colorful.

768
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:25,845
Mainly in the green
and red spectrums.

769
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:30,687
Variegated varieties with inflorescences
composed of multiple florets,

770
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,922
each with a modified calyx.

771
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:36,249
Wise Lord of the Sacred Word,
we seek your counsel.

772
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:39,608
Once, a weed,
uprooted and burned.

773
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:45,050
Now prized for the vigor of its oils
and the sustenance of its leaves.

774
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,600
But what is its truth?

775
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,808
You! Turn around.

776
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,803
You prefer the view from behind?

777
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,928
No, I... Well, yes.

778
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,287
You know I can't lie. Turn.

779
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:02,927
I'm not going to risk
looking at those tricky eyes of yours.

780
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,321
- Forty-seven.
- Excuse me?

781
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:06,970
The percentage of knowledge
I have so far recorded.

782
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,451
I'm not even half done.

783
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,931
Thoth, I only need...

784
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,764
The answer to the riddle of the Sphinx.

785
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:14,047
A child could deduce why you're here.

786
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:17,522
Go ask the riddle
and come back and relay it to me.

787
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:21,047
- I'll solve it.
- One of us would have to die.

788
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,770
Well, draw lots.

789
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:25,042
- Come with us.
- Ha!

790
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:27,600
- One night. I'll give you one night.
- Hmm...

791
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:29,245
No, you won't.

792
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:31,846
Set must be stopped
before he destroys us all.

793
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,366
You see the wisdom in that, don't you?

794
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:38,001
This is far too important to risk.

795
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,447
I can recite
the true names of the stars.

796
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:41,601
I know.

797
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,489
I've seen the world created
from sand and water.

798
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:44,561
Mmm-hmm.

799
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,529
I contain all the wisdom in the universe.

800
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:51,162
More precious than some crown.
Ha! I have it!

801
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:54,244
Its mystery. Its essence. Its truth.

802
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,170
It's lettuce!

803
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:59,246
Your father dropped his guard.

804
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:01,687
That was not only extremely stupid,

805
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:04,570
but now I'm forced to
write down everything I know

806
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,563
as a defense against
the remote possibility

807
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,563
that Set's war finds me.

808
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:13,487
I'm sorry that the corpses of my parents
have inconvenienced you.

809
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:16,723
Apology accepted. Now, get out!

810
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,087
But you have to help us!

811
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:21,930
Careful.

812
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,446
I outnumber you.

813
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,610
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

814
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:31,242
It's fine. I'll do it.

815
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:33,368
I thought you were a stray baboon.

816
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,841
I told you I'd be the one
to face the Sphinx.

817
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:38,685
Your chance of failure is overwhelming.

818
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:41,570
I'm sure. But before it kills me
I'm going to tell it that I asked

819
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:45,201
the God of Wisdom to come but he was
afraid he'd get the answer wrong.

820
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,886
This is the cleverest strategy
you could devise?

821
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:52,249
Playing on my ego?
How vain do you think I am?

822
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,642
Um... Hmm.

823
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:00,531
Yes, well...

824
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:02,681
Fine.

825
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:04,491
Fine!

826
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,491
Let's go.

827
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:12,567
Bye.

828
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:15,771
Well done.

829
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:16,921
Thank you.

830
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,487
You know his Zaya
can never come back.

831
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,324
The King doesn't have the power.

832
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:40,325
Anubis doesn't have the power.
You deceived him.

833
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,927
He will probably die
trying to break into Set's pyramid.

834
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,923
He offered his life.

835
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,684
Because he thought
he could save her.

836
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,364
He believes what he
wants to believe.

837
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:52,410
You've been blind
in more ways than one.

838
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,767
You really watched the world
come into being?

839
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:56,080
I don't lie.

840
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,965
Where were you watching it from,
if nothing had been created yet?

841
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:01,731
If I even attempted to explain,

842
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:05,088
your brain would liquefy
and run out of your ears.

843
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:09,410
I did not choose a path of revenge.
I chose none of this.

844
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,608
You tell me what kind of power
do I really have?

845
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:14,126
You have the power
to make this right.

846
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,248
He deserves to know the truth.

847
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:20,041
I need him to get us in
to choke Set's fire.

848
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:22,566
If he refuses, we'll all die.
ls that what you want?

849
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,603
It's too dangerous to cross the plain.

850
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:40,002
- We'll wait for darkness.
- But we're running out of time.

851
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:42,691
- I say we cross now.
- And I say we wait.

852
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:57,050
All the time you were apart,
she never forgot you.

853
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,162
You've always been in
Hathor's heart, you know.

854
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:02,322
Yes, but she's got a big heart.

855
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,084
Room enough for a crowd in there.

856
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:08,886
Tell me, oh, wise Lord of the Air.

857
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,201
Why do you think Set let you live?

858
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:17,608
She did it for love.
You'd punish her for that?

859
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:20,445
I didn't want her help.

860
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:24,131
I only ever wanted one thing.

861
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:28,525
You know,
I think everyone's a fool.

862
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:31,763
But you, My Lord,
are bigger than most.

863
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:50,169
Are you thinking about her?

864
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:54,563
Of course you are.

865
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:59,882
I was once known
as the Mistress of the West.

866
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:04,170
My duty was to help dead souls
make their way to the Afterlife.

867
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:06,402
You traveled
to the Land of the Dead?

868
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,404
I'm the Goddess of Love.
Even to those who have died.

869
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:13,607
I was young. Easily seduced.

870
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:16,251
- "Seduced"?
- Demons.

871
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,322
This keeps them at bay.

872
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,449
The Bracelet of 42 Stars.

873
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:24,524
One for each of the demons
Horus slayed to free me.

874
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,722
That's when I knew I loved him.

875
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,121
Zaya needs to know
you're fighting for her.

876
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,646
So she does not lose hope.

877
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,051
Zaya.

878
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:43,291
Zaya.

879
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:48,966
Zaya? Zaya?
Can you hear me?

880
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:50,445
Zaya?

881
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,405
Who is it?

882
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,811
Who's there?

883
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:58,083
<i>- Hathor, Mistress of the West.
- Mistress.</i>

884
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,003
I speak to you
from the Land of the Living.

885
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,411
Your beloved is with me.

886
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:03,482
- <i>Bek?</i>
- Zaya, it's me.

887
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,769
<i>I knew</i> if there was a way,
you would find it.

888
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,923
But I can't see you.

889
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,367
<i>Listen, we can be together again.
You</i> can <i>return.</i>

890
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:13,481
But how?

891
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,161
I'm helping Horus.

892
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:17,766
In return,
he's going to help us.

893
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,604
<i>It is really the</i> Bek I love?

894
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:21,921
I know, Zaya. I can hardly
believe it myself.

895
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,002
Bek, me, trusting the gods.

896
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,045
But I was wrong, Zaya.

897
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:28,367
Horus is a just god,
as you said he would be.

898
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,249
You're probably thinking,
"I told you so," right now.

899
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:33,449
Well, yes. Just a little bit.

900
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:35,890
It's so good to hear your voice.

901
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:38,042
Everything's <i>going</i>
to be fine, Zaya, trust me.

902
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:40,009
Horus <i>is going</i>
to bring you back.

903
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,525
<i>I know he will.</i>

904
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,011
Bek?

905
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,644
Bek, are you there?

906
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:52,562
It is forbidden for the dead
to speak with the living.

907
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:55,281
Go.

908
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,009
There's a wheel inside.

909
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:22,048
When you turn it,
the sand stops moving.

910
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:23,770
We just need
to go through the door.

911
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,410
Good thing you saw those plans.

912
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:27,528
If you didn't know
which one it was,

913
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:29,483
this would truly be impossible.

914
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:32,761
- Bek?
<i>'</i> Yes?

915
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:35,320
You do know
which is the door, right?

916
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:38,524
Yes, of course, it's...
This one.

917
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:41,450
No, no, it's...
It's that one.

918
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,963
No, no, it's this one!

919
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:57,970
Roll the bones.

920
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:43,686
You guessed?

921
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:45,330
Well...

922
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:48,768
I find your dependence
on chance troubling.

923
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:52,322
If you continue to survive,
I may need to study you further.

924
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,131
Now, which way to the Sphinx?

925
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:33,082
Trespassers in the House of the King,
answer my riddle or cease to be.

926
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:36,568
Go on. I'm waiting.

927
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,040
I never was.

928
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,922
Am always to be.

929
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,402
No one ever saw me, nor ever will.

930
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:51,280
And yet I am the confidence
of all who live and breathe.

931
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:55,001
What am I?

932
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:59,486
Order. You are Order.

933
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:04,764
I never doubted you.

934
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:11,768
Incorrect.

935
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:15,410
Try again. Please.

936
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:19,160
That was a completely suitable answer.

937
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:22,687
You are Purity.

938
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:31,641
Wrong again.

939
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,802
"What never was."

940
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:36,486
"Always to be."

941
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:38,881
In the future. Non-existent. Imaginary.

942
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,485
Yet...

943
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:45,291
Yet it exists and "never was."

944
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:48,170
- "Always to be."
- Thoth...

945
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:50,481
"Yet I'm the confidence
of all who live and breathe."

946
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:53,166
Mortals live and breathe!
Maybe stop thinking like a god.

947
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:55,766
- Then I might as well stop thinking.
- Thoth!

948
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:59,683
Wait, wait, I have it!
You are Tomorrow.

949
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,922
Oh, bother.

950
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,445
One drop.

951
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:39,281
No!

952
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:49,050
I should thank you.

953
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:53,569
You lured him from his library
so that I didn't have to.

954
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:57,650
The final piece.

955
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:59,370
You coward.

956
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:02,171
- Open this gate and fight me.
- Again?

957
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:05,163
Hasn't she seen you lose enough?

958
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:10,482
Can't you allow me to spare you one last
moment of embarrassment before you die?

959
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:12,641
Stop!

960
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:15,764
Recognize this?

961
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:21,130
Did he tell you he could bring
your woman back from death?

962
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:23,370
It's not possible.

963
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,445
Not even for me.

964
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:27,528
You expect me to believe you?

965
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,723
I don't have to lie.

966
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:34,966
How else would a blind,
useless god get you to help him?

967
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:37,965
Go on.

968
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:39,560
Ask him.

969
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,568
- Pour it in.
- Is it true?

970
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:46,163
Bek, pour it in!

971
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:48,731
No!

972
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,481
Shame you weren't on my side.

973
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:05,643
I admire someone that doesn't
let death stand in his way.

974
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:09,327
But this is what love gets you.

975
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:14,761
It's quite fitting that you'll both
die together here in my house.

976
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:18,447
I'll miss the conversation.
And the rest.

977
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:12,528
You denied me vengeance.

978
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:17,084
Zaya thought you were
the greatest thing in all of creation.

979
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:21,044
Every day, she prayed for you
to save Egypt, but you didn't come.

980
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:24,966
- I was in a tomb. I didn't hear.
- No, you didn't listen.

981
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:27,487
All you care about
is your stupid vengeance.

982
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:31,047
I started to think
I was wrong about you.

983
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:33,963
But I've finally learned
the lesson of the gods.

984
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:35,246
We don't matter to you.

985
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,204
Well, now you know.

986
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,641
Anubis, come forth.

987
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:07,082
Mistress.

988
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:10,369
You are still
as lovely as the first dawn.

989
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:12,169
Hathor, what are you doing?

990
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:15,210
This mortal's beloved bears
no treasure for the scales.

991
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:19,683
- Perhaps we can help her.
- You ask much, Mistress.

992
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:23,765
It would require a very
special treasure indeed.

993
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:26,411
- No. No. No!
- Like this?

994
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:29,723
For you, Mistress of the West?

995
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:31,645
Yes.

996
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:35,122
Grant him passage
to give it to her himself.

997
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:41,007
- You will see her one last time.
- Thank you.

998
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:44,881
No, no, I forbid it.

999
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:47,167
We're both guilty of deceiving Bek.

1000
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:51,962
- This will make amends.
- Not like this. Not with you.

1001
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,691
I command you to release me.

1002
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:58,526
You can't command me. You know why.

1003
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,450
I'm the Goddess of Love.

1004
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:10,683
- If I don't do this, I'm nothing.
- I can't lose you again.

1005
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:49,046
Take it.

1006
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:02,768
Do what you need to do.

1007
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:23,208
The Hall of Two Truths.

1008
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:26,881
Where we shall be judged.

1009
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:31,208
Step forward.

1010
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:47,001
What do you offer?

1011
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:56,449
Step forward.

1012
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:04,401
I shall live forever!

1013
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:10,522
What do you offer?

1014
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:22,963
Step forward.

1015
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:42,320
Step forward.

1016
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:54,122
What do you offer?

1017
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:58,361
What do you offer?

1018
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,001
Zaya.

1019
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:10,727
Bek.

1020
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:43,044
Set, receive the
golden wings of Nephthys.

1021
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:46,488
May they protect him
from those who would harm.

1022
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:02,687
The karr of Thoth,
God of Wisdom.

1023
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:05,047
Allow him knowledge of old.

1024
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:16,364
The heart of Osiris.
Grant him dominion over all Lands.

1025
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:20,847
The all-seeing eye.

1026
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:24,891
Reward him so no enemy can deceive.

1027
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:43,402
You look glorious, Lord.

1028
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:48,080
I know.

1029
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:09,441
Father...

1030
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:16,931
I noticed the tower. Impressive.

1031
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:19,243
I built it for you.

1032
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:22,085
If it were any taller,
it would be in my way.

1033
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:26,449
Turn your eyes from your sails
and look at everything I've done.

1034
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:30,523
What Osiris never could.

1035
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:32,648
I rule all that breathes.

1036
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:35,483
And all that is breathed upon.

1037
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:38,971
None is mightier below the sun.

1038
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:42,169
Then honor me as I've honored you.

1039
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:44,004
If honor had been your intent,

1040
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:47,090
you might have abstained
from murdering your brother.

1041
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:50,130
So you do see everything down there.

1042
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:53,568
Tell me, Father,
do you care what happens?

1043
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:58,562
I care more than you know.

1044
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:01,166
Then why was I cast out alone...

1045
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:04,720
...to walk on burning sand,

1046
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:09,963
while my brother played barefoot
by the shores of the Nile?

1047
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:18,564
Why did you make Osiris King?
And why did you give him a son?

1048
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:21,291
And yet you denied me
the chance to even give life.

1049
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:24,569
- This was your test.
- You didn't test him.

1050
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:27,530
I gave Osiris the crown of Egypt.

1051
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:32,610
And when the time came,
he didn't cling to his power.

1052
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:37,208
He gave it away freely.
He passed his test.

1053
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:40,090
- And I'd wager I've passed mine.
- Not yet.

1054
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,650
It's true...

1055
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:44,930
I did not want you to have children.

1056
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:49,646
This was a kindness,
because I did not want you to miss them

1057
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:51,131
as terribly as I have.

1058
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:52,486
Miss them?

1059
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:55,962
I need you to take my place.

1060
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:59,086
Here?

1061
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:01,766
This is how your test ends, my son.

1062
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:04,286
There is no greater burden.

1063
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:07,810
But no greater honor.

1064
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:14,082
All you have done can be forgiven.

1065
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:25,768
You expect me to joust with this beast

1066
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:29,606
night after night until I die?

1067
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:31,569
What do you want?

1068
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:33,449
Immortality.

1069
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:37,007
Immortality awaits us
all in the Afterlife.

1070
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:39,811
I don't want to die. I want to live.

1071
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:43,726
Forever.
Down there in the lands I conquered.

1072
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:47,202
My kingdom.
This should be my reward.

1073
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:50,489
How? The only way to achieve
this is unthinkable.

1074
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:54,281
- One would need to devour...
- The Afterlife itself.

1075
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:56,761
You would unleash Chaos
upon creation?

1076
01:34:56,840 --> 01:34:58,888
You would destroy everything?

1077
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:04,285
Not destroy. Reshape it.
I will take your place.

1078
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:06,761
But it won't be sitting
on some damn boat.

1079
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:32,682
No god could withstand that.

1080
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:36,361
I'm not just one god.

1081
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:15,491
What do you offer?

1082
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:17,528
This will buy you
a place in the Afterlife.

1083
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:18,601
No.

1084
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:21,040
Not without you.

1085
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:35,649
The gate has been broken!
Chaos spreads.

1086
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:37,848
Apophis shall destroy this land.

1087
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:50,763
Horus is our only hope now.

1088
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:52,400
He's not the god you think he is, Zaya.

1089
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:55,683
- He lied to me.
- Give him another chance.

1090
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:57,444
He only got this far because of you.

1091
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:59,682
My strength is not infinite.

1092
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:02,764
If the Lord of the Air
has any plan to rectify this,

1093
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:04,763
he should do so with haste.

1094
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:07,611
If you don't trust him, trust me.

1095
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:09,808
I know we'll be together again.

1096
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:24,489
Ra has fallen.
Set has unleashed Chaos.

1097
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:26,005
So how do we stop him?

1098
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:30,049
You never give up, do you?

1099
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:31,645
Only because Zaya told me not to.

1100
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:33,445
You didn't tell her about our bargain?

1101
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:36,922
Yes, I did tell her. But for some
reason, she still believes in you.

1102
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:40,125
We must return to the capital.

1103
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:42,765
Then we have a long walk ahead of us.

1104
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:46,401
I prefer flying.

1105
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:51,281
Nephthys.

1106
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:54,168
Even beyond death,
she's trying to help us.

1107
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:13,562
Come, demon!

1108
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,362
Set has Ra's spear.

1109
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:45,444
He's drawing Apophis to the Nile,
to the source of all life.

1110
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:46,521
Why?

1111
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:49,046
To drink it. To destroy all creation.

1112
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:52,124
Ra isn't dead. And only he
can make this right.

1113
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:53,964
But he needs his spear.

1114
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:55,610
So how do we get it back?

1115
01:38:56,440 --> 01:38:57,930
Maybe it's time we go fishing.

1116
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:09,521
I come in your service,
I ask for your help.

1117
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:10,886
Builder.

1118
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:14,450
We have need of you.

1119
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:36,089
It is the single greatest
architectural achievement

1120
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:37,605
that ever was and ever will be.

1121
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:40,085
My...

1122
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:45,165
I mean, Lord Set's obelisk

1123
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:51,202
stands exactly <i>2,220</i> cubits tall.
And not a rod off.

1124
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:53,648
Built from seven billion
blocks of granite,

1125
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:58,965
five billion slabs of Tura limestone,
and nine billion talents of gold.

1126
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:00,963
And the lives of how many slaves?

1127
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:05,247
5,930.

1128
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:07,288
No, wait.

1129
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:10,884
Make that 5,931.

1130
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:14,207
Don't! You need him
to get to the roof.

1131
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:17,921
I'll see you up top.

1132
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,321
You stood beside him
as if he were your friend.

1133
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,447
Oh, I know how it feels.
Favor of a god.

1134
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:56,682
It's intoxicating.

1135
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:59,081
I'm sorry you picked
the wrong one to follow.

1136
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:00,650
He's improving.

1137
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:02,927
Your woman's still dead, isn't she?

1138
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,924
Shame. Such a pretty girl.

1139
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,286
Hmm...

1140
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:09,328
Such lovely soft skin.

1141
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:15,684
Riches for the Afterlife.

1142
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:19,487
You see? I'm ready to die.

1143
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:12,961
Come, Apophis!

1144
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:40,928
You should have
stayed under the sand.

1145
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,970
I can understand killing for a crown,
but this is madness.

1146
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:46,691
Of course you don't understand.
How could you?

1147
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:49,206
Favored son of a favored son.

1148
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:40,201
By the way, Apophis is going to eat
the Land of the Dead.

1149
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:41,645
You'll never make it
to the Afterlife now.

1150
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:42,801
What?

1151
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:52,489
Who picked the wrong god now?

1152
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:27,410
I think I may actually miss
our little get-togethers.

1153
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:34,609
But you're still no match for me.

1154
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:36,966
You're right.

1155
01:44:38,920 --> 01:44:40,604
I'm just the bait.

1156
01:44:46,240 --> 01:44:47,969
Now you're just becoming a pest.

1157
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:08,008
Horus!

1158
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:52,649
You don't think your eye might have been
more useful than a wounded thief?

1159
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:54,324
Probably, yes.

1160
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:58,768
I'm sorry for everything
I've done to you.

1161
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:03,364
- Including this.
- Accepted.

1162
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:36,289
I told you
I'd steal your other eye.

1163
01:46:36,360 --> 01:46:39,045
But you could have saved me some trouble
and told me you didn't need it.

1164
01:46:39,160 --> 01:46:42,289
Ra showed me the way,
but I didn't listen.

1165
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:44,727
I believed I needed my eye
to transform,

1166
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:48,486
but my journey isn't to seek
revenge at all costs.

1167
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:51,488
It is to protect my people.

1168
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:54,287
Stop congratulating yourself.

1169
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:55,964
You've got more protecting to do.

1170
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:23,690
Behold, the new King.

1171
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:28,286
I thought you were
the greatest of all the gods.

1172
01:49:28,360 --> 01:49:30,283
Now look at you.

1173
01:49:30,360 --> 01:49:32,124
You have nothing.

1174
01:49:32,200 --> 01:49:35,522
I am the greatest god.

1175
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:38,570
I spared you once. Huh?

1176
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:42,640
- I showed you mercy.
- I won't make that mistake.

1177
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,401
Grandfather, there's still time.

1178
01:50:08,120 --> 01:50:10,122
Enough, beast!

1179
01:51:28,240 --> 01:51:29,366
Thank you.

1180
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:40,811
We make a good team.

1181
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:43,648
Are you sure you're not a god?

1182
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:45,848
What would I be the god of?

1183
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:48,925
Stupidity?

1184
01:51:50,160 --> 01:51:51,286
The Impossible.

1185
01:51:56,240 --> 01:51:57,287
Bek?

1186
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:55,684
I have never been in debt.
And yet I am in debt to you, grandson.

1187
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:59,165
Ask whatever you will.

1188
01:52:59,240 --> 01:53:01,368
Mountains will kneel before you.

1189
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:03,124
The winds will do your bidding.

1190
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:05,726
Answer quickly,
for Apophis still hungers.

1191
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:08,927
And night is always coming.

1192
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:13,841
I want nothing.

1193
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:18,129
Except what's impossible for me to give.

1194
01:53:44,160 --> 01:53:45,924
Am I...

1195
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,923
You've returned.

1196
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,684
Bek?

1197
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:51,006
You might want to help her.

1198
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:54,487
Zaya.

1199
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:01,211
Bek.

1200
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:02,566
Zaya?

1201
01:54:03,640 --> 01:54:05,927
- I'm Horus.
- My Lord.

1202
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,445
I thought this was impossible.

1203
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:10,444
Impossible? Yes.

1204
01:54:19,320 --> 01:54:22,369
Hail Ra, Lord of Light!

1205
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:26,770
Hail Ra, Lord of Light!

1206
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:31,361
<i>And</i> so wisdom had been found.

1207
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:34,922
<i>Tests had been passed.
Second chances given.</i>

1208
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:38,527
<i>To live again.
To be whole again.</i>

1209
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:41,371
<i>Horus mourned his parents.</i>

1210
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:43,761
<i>They had long since passed
into the Afterlife.</i>

1211
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:46,002
<i>But he knew
it was the wisdom of Ra</i>

1212
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:49,289
<i>that the Final Gate would
remain as it had always been.</i>

1213
01:54:49,400 --> 01:54:54,247
<i>An unbreakable barrier between
this life and immortality.</i>

1214
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:55,526
You think I'm ready?

1215
01:54:55,600 --> 01:55:01,482
Hmm, true readiness is a notoriously
difficult state to achieve.

1216
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:04,564
- But you're close enough.
- Hmm.

1217
01:55:16,840 --> 01:55:19,650
Arise, Horus...

1218
01:55:19,720 --> 01:55:22,690
King of all Egypt.

1219
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:36,965
From this moment on, the Afterlife
must be earned, not with gold,

1220
01:55:37,880 --> 01:55:43,250
but by good deeds,
compassion, and generosity.

1221
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:47,769
What we do, how we act
in this life matters.

1222
01:55:55,600 --> 01:55:57,204
Are you thinking about her?

1223
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:00,281
Of course, you are.

1224
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:06,921
You didn't think I'd misplace
Egypt's greatest treasure?

1225
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:10,927
You think they'd miss me
if I were gone a few days?

1226
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,082
As Chief Advisor to the King,

1227
01:56:13,160 --> 01:56:15,083
it's my duty to ensure
they hardly notice.

1228
01:56:15,160 --> 01:56:17,242
But if anyone asks...

1229
01:56:17,320 --> 01:56:18,970
Tell them I had
to go help a friend.

1230
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:24,807
I leave Egypt
in your capable hands.
