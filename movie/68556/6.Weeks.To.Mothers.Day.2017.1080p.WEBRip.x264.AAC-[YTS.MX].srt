00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:46,583
{\an8}<i>Thuey. Thuey, it's time for school.</i>

4
00:00:46,917 --> 00:00:52,792
{\an8}<i>Dome, you're on cooking duty right?</i>
<i>Op is farming. Let's go.</i>

5
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,500
{\an8}<i>Wake up, guys, it's morning.</i>

6
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:10,167
{\an8}<i>Kids, wake up.</i>

7
00:01:11,167 --> 00:01:12,208
{\an8}<i>Wake up.</i>

8
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,417
{\an8}<i>Come on, wake up, kids.</i>

9
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:19,583
{\an8}<i>Mai.</i>

10
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:22,458
{\an8}<i>Mek.</i>

11
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,542
{\an8}<i>Hey, let me see your back.</i>

12
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:25,583
{\an8}<i>You've barely cleaned your back, it's still dry.</i>

13
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,458
{\an8}<i>Reach down and clean your butt too.</i>

14
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:57,625
{\an8}<i>That's enough, not too much.</i>

15
00:02:57,917 --> 00:03:00,625
{\an8}<i>Press to break it up a bit, that's good.</i>

16
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,042
{\an8}<i>Give it a second.</i>

17
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,958
{\an8}<i>That's it, Sir. Wash it clean.</i>

18
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:21,542
{\an8}<i>It's time to add the fish sauce,</i>
<i>but not too much or it'll be too salty.</i>

19
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,458
{\an8}<i>Now, taste again.</i>

20
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,333
{\an8}<i>Good Morning, Mother Nee.</i>

21
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:24,167
{\an8}<i>Thank you, good morning to you.</i>

22
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:30,000
{\an8}<i>It's July right now, what month is next?</i>

23
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,250
{\an8}<i>August.</i>

24
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:31,917
{\an8}<i>Huh?</i>

25
00:04:31,917 --> 00:04:32,833
{\an8}<i>August.</i>

26
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:37,583
{\an8}<i>August, yes. August has a special day,</i>
<i>does anyone know what it is?</i>

27
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:38,625
{\an8}<i>Mother's Day.</i>

28
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,542
{\an8}<i>Yes! And what date is Mother's Day?</i>

29
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:42,042
{\an8}<i>The 12th.</i>

30
00:04:42,042 --> 00:04:44,458
{\an8}<i>The 12th of August.</i>

31
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,875
{\an8}<i>What is our annual tradition?</i>

32
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:47,833
{\an8}<i>We honor Mom.</i>

33
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,042
{\an8}<i>Yes, we honor Mom.</i>

34
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:50,958
{\an8}<i>And do you guys know</i>

35
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,958
{\an8}<i>how old our school is?</i>

36
00:04:54,542 --> 00:04:56,250
{\an8}<i>5 years. 30 years.</i>

37
00:04:56,292 --> 00:04:57,708
{\an8}<i>How many years?</i>

38
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,042
{\an8}<i>34 years.</i>

39
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,375
{\an8}<i>Who's going to get it?</i>

40
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,042
{\an8}<i>34.</i>

41
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,875
{\an8}<i>37 years. 36 years.</i>

42
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,083
{\an8}<i>50 years.</i>

43
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:09,958
{\an8}<i>Whoa! 50 years old? No, not correct yet.</i>

44
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,292
{\an8}<i>Kim</i>

45
00:05:11,292 --> 00:05:11,917
{\an8}<i>35 years.</i>

46
00:05:11,917 --> 00:05:13,750
{\an8}<i>Yes, give Kim a round of applause.</i>

47
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,417
{\an8}<i>35 years now that Children's Village</i>
<i>has been around.</i>

48
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:22,125
{\an8}<i>And...</i>

49
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:28,375
{\an8}<i>The person we owe the most to is?</i>

50
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:34,125
{\an8}<i>The person who built this school and</i>
<i>has been here from day one is?</i>

51
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,542
{\an8}<i>Mother Aew.</i>

52
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:40,583
{\an8}<i>The most senior mother of us all here at</i>
<i>Children's Village, the most important mother is?</i>

53
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:41,833
{\an8}<i>Mother Aew.</i>

54
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:45,875
{\an8}<i>Yes, and don't forget all the other mothers here</i>
<i>who look after you.</i>

55
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:48,458
{\an8}<i>Her health isn't so good.</i>

56
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,208
{\an8}<i>Did you know Mom is sick? Did you know?</i>

57
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:53,958
{\an8}<i>Her leg is?</i>

58
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,500
{\an8}<i>Not good.</i>

59
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,917
{\an8}<i>Mom is suffering from?</i>

60
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:58,250
{\an8}<i>Diabetes.</i>

61
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:04,167
{\an8}<i>Mom has a heart condition.</i>
<i>Mom has a tumor in her gall bladder.</i>

62
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:09,750
{\an8}<i>If that tumor ever grows longer than</i>
<i>one centimeter her life will be in danger.</i>

63
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:13,750
{\an8}<i>So we have to think about</i>
<i>what we can do to honor her properly.</i>

64
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,958
{\an8}<i>Her health isn't too good.</i>

65
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:22,625
{\an8}<i>She's looked after this school for 35 years.</i>

66
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:27,208
{\an8}<i>Built all these buildings for us to live in,</i>
<i>provided them with food to eat.</i>

67
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:36,750
{\an8}<i>Mother Aew has strived to make this a quality</i>
<i>school to give you an education and a future.</i>

68
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,833
{\an8}<i>This is a special year, we need ideas.</i>

69
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:44,083
{\an8}<i>We're going to have each class present</i>
<i>their ideas. Can we do that?</i>

70
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,417
{\an8}<i>Yes!</i>

71
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:58,458
{\an8}<i>Mom, when can I go visit my parents home?</i>
<i>I want to see it.</i>

72
00:06:58,458 --> 00:06:59,542
{\an8}<i>Where is your home?</i>

73
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:00,417
{\an8}<i>Chonburi</i>

74
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,375
{\an8}<i>Where?</i>

75
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,250
{\an8}<i>Chonburi, we found your birth mother there?</i>

76
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:08,000
{\an8}<i>Do you know the address?</i>

77
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:14,167
{\an8}<i>Animals, as in dogs, cats, pigs and such.</i>

78
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,708
{\an8}<i>Mom, visitors.</i>

79
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:19,792
{\an8}<i>Visitors?</i>

80
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,875
{\an8}<i>Wow.</i>

81
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:56,500
{\an8}<i>Some kids here are orphans or were abandoned.</i>

82
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:02,000
{\an8}<i>We are doing our best</i>
<i>to build them into future parents</i>

83
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,875
{\an8}<i>who can lead better lives.</i>

84
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,875
{\an8}<i>Thank you so much for helping us.</i>

85
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,458
{\an8}<i>Giving us hope.</i>

86
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,500
{\an8}<i>Thank you.</i>

87
00:08:23,417 --> 00:08:25,625
{\an8}<i>They certainly don't look lonely.</i>

88
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:32,917
{\an8}<i>Now we've set up separate houses,</i>
<i>and usually they cook</i>

89
00:08:32,917 --> 00:08:37,083
{\an8}<i>and eat there with teachers,</i>
<i>but today someone has donated dinner,</i>

90
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:41,375
{\an8}<i>so we'll eat at the cafeteria.</i>

91
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,750
{\an8}<i>At first we came in and thought we were lost.</i>

92
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,708
{\an8}<i>because we didn't know it was laid out like this.</i>

93
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:50,042
{\an8}<i>It has a warm atmosphere.</i>

94
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:56,542
{\an8}<i>Many of the children come from families without</i>

95
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:59,208
{\an8}<i>warmth or love. Some didn't have families.</i>

96
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,458
{\an8}<i>So we try to give them that.</i>

97
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,667
{\an8}<i>So there are teachers that live in the houses</i>
<i>with the kids?</i>

98
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:09,542
{\an8}<i>Yes, and they call all the teachers Mom.</i>
<i>Mom or Dad.</i>

99
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,958
{\an8}<i>Check it out. Just what I wanted.</i>

100
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,208
{\an8}<i>Who wants this one?</i>

101
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,167
{\an8}<i>Have you had enough yet?</i>

102
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:49,333
{\an8}<i>No!</i>

103
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:30,958
{\an8}<i>Your teacher has said it's an honor to have</i>
<i>me here, but I consider it an honor that</i>

104
00:10:31,042 --> 00:10:35,125
{\an8}<i>I find myself speaking at</i>
<i>the Nikrotaram Temple School.</i>

105
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:39,417
{\an8}<i>It's an honor to be here</i>
<i>to speak about democracy today.</i>

106
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:46,292
{\an8}<i>The reason is because I am the principal at</i>
<i>a democratic school called Children's Village.</i>

107
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:53,208
{\an8}<i>We follow the Summerhill education system</i>
<i>which makes us a democratic school</i>

108
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:59,167
{\an8}<i>because we focus on freedom for our</i>
<i>students. Freedom and equality.</i>

109
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:06,625
{\an8}<i>That freedom is given in the form of</i>
<i>allowing students to make their own decisions</i>

110
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:14,125
{\an8}<i>or simply put, students are allowed to choose</i>
<i>what they want to study</i>

111
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:16,250
{\an8}<i>or study what they excel at.</i>

112
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:23,292
{\an8}<i>If you want to give children that level of</i>
<i>freedom there has to be equality.</i>

113
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:34,083
{\an8}<i>First, the authority teachers have over students</i>
<i>has to be minimized.</i>

114
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:38,250
{\an8}<i>The teachers have to act as a guide</i>

115
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:42,833
{\an8}<i>and seek out what the students are</i>
<i>naturally proficient in.</i>

116
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:49,792
{\an8}<i>A democratic school sets up a dialogue</i>
<i>between the teachers and the students.</i>

117
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,167
{\an8}<i>Moving on, are there any reports?</i>

118
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:56,542
{\an8}<i>Yes, Odette?</i>

119
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:57,875
{\an8}<i>I report Milo.</i>

120
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:01,250
{\an8}<i>Is Milo here?</i>

121
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,000
{\an8}<i>Reporting him for?</i>

122
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,667
{\an8}<i>Kicking me in the face.</i>

123
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,333
{\an8}<i>Where?</i>

124
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,542
{\an8}<i>The library.</i>

125
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:15,208
{\an8}<i>Were there any witnesses?</i>

126
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:16,792
{\an8}<i>Yes.</i>

127
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:17,958
{\an8}<i>Who?</i>

128
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,375
{\an8}<i>Poy.</i>

129
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,208
{\an8}<i>Poy, is that true?</i>

130
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,083
{\an8}<i>Poy, as Odette's witness</i>
<i>please tell us what transpired.</i>

131
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:32,833
{\an8}<i>Odette was sitting in the library</i>
<i>and she asked me</i>

132
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,042
{\an8}<i>"Do you know what jam is in English?"</i>
<i>Then she said "jam".</i>

133
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,833
{\an8}<i>Then Milo kicked Odette's face.</i>

134
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,542
{\an8}<i>Then Odette started to cry.</i>

135
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:48,375
{\an8}<i>Mom, can we punish the accused</i>
<i>if he isn't here?</i>

136
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:54,875
{\an8}<i>The rules state that the accused</i>
<i>can be punished in absentia</i>

137
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,750
{\an8}<i>because they did not exercise</i>
<i>their right to appeal.</i>

138
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,042
{\an8}<i>Who would like to recommend</i>
<i>punishments for Milo.</i>

139
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:04,250
{\an8}<i>I recommend that Milo clean the library</i>
<i>as punishment</i>

140
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,333
{\an8}<i>for using excessive force on a schoolmate.</i>

141
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,458
{\an8}<i>Two days!</i>

142
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:10,250
{\an8}<i>Anyone else?</i>

143
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:15,875
{\an8}<i>Garbage collection.</i>
<i>Until he fills two buckets.</i>

144
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:17,583
{\an8}<i>Just fill two. The reason is...</i>

145
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:23,167
{\an8}<i>have him collect garbage to learn</i>
<i>not to use force and control his emotions.</i>

146
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,583
{\an8}<i>Have Milo collect two buckets of garbage</i>
<i>and also look after Odette for a day</i>

147
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:35,125
{\an8}<i>because she has less strength</i>
<i>than him and he should take care of her.</i>

148
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:37,333
{\an8}<i>We will vote now.</i>

149
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:43,417
{\an8}<i>Who would like Milo to clean the library</i>
<i>for two days?</i>

150
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:49,292
{\an8}<i>Who would like Milo to collect</i>
<i>two buckets of garbage?</i>

151
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:55,500
{\an8}<i>Who would like Milo to collect</i>
<i>two buckets of garbage</i>

152
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,958
{\an8}<i>and look after Odette for one day?</i>

153
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:06,958
{\an8}<i>Milo receives the punishment of...</i>

154
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:09,750
{\an8}<i>collecting two buckets of garbage</i>

155
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,917
{\an8}<i>and looking after Odette for one day.</i>
<i>Forty votes.</i>

156
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,583
{\an8}<i>Are there any more reports?</i>

157
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:17,958
{\an8}<i>Yes, Sin.</i>

158
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,833
{\an8}<i>I report the entire school.</i>

159
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:23,542
{\an8}<i>Right now, there is garbage everywhere.</i>

160
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:28,042
{\an8}<i>These pictures were taken</i>
<i>during lunchtime today.</i>

161
00:14:28,042 --> 00:14:32,333
{\an8}<i>The rules state</i>
<i>that everyone must help look after</i>

162
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,167
{\an8}<i>the school's environment.</i>

163
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:38,750
{\an8}<i>If 10 pieces of litter are found,</i>
<i>all students miss one day of snacks.</i>

164
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:42,750
{\an8}<i>If 20 pieces are found, two days are missed.</i>

165
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:46,125
{\an8}<i>But there is way more than 20 pieces out there.</i>

166
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:49,000
{\an8}<i>Did you count them?</i>

167
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:54,292
{\an8}<i>This slideshow is over four minutes long.</i>

168
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:58,625
{\an8}<i>It has 109 pictures in it.</i>

169
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,417
{\an8}<i>These are just 109 pictures as an example.</i>

170
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,292
{\an8}<i>So we should divide it by 10.</i>

171
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:14,542
{\an8}<i>So, the result is the entire school</i>
<i>will miss 10 days of snacks.</i>

172
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:22,167
{\an8}<i>Now we can't enjoy.</i>
<i>We can't ask anyone for snacks.</i>

173
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:29,750
{\an8}<i>We've taken this first step, which is punishment.</i>

174
00:15:30,292 --> 00:15:35,042
{\an8}<i>The entire school is punished</i>
<i>because Sin reported the entire school,</i>

175
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:40,625
{\an8}<i>but there must be preventive measures</i>
<i>as well as</i>

176
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:43,042
{\an8}<i>punitive measures to solve this issue.</i>

177
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:47,250
{\an8}<i>So, this is about changing the behavior of</i>
<i>our students.</i>

178
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,542
{\an8}<i>Mother Joom, go ahead.</i>

179
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:55,417
{\an8}<i>I'd like to table an idea</i>
<i>for ongoing consideration, and that</i>

180
00:15:55,417 --> 00:16:00,417
{\an8}<i>is to change the rules from missing</i>
<i>one day of snacks to one movie session.</i>

181
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:06,417
{\an8}<i>So, if 10 pieces of garbage are found,</i>

182
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:10,000
{\an8}<i>students miss a movie session.</i>

183
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:14,583
{\an8}<i>I just want to present that idea</i>
<i>so everyone can go and think about it,</i>

184
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:18,167
{\an8}<i>and any of those thoughts</i>
<i>or discussions can take place</i>

185
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:22,458
{\an8}<i>at the next council meeting.</i>

186
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,167
{\an8}<i>We are going to come join in.</i>
<i>Reserve us a spot.</i>

187
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,500
{\an8}<i>Oh, the lines long?</i>

188
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,292
{\an8}<i>Wow, you've got a long line?</i>

189
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:58,000
{\an8}<i>This is the student's practical training.</i>

190
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,917
{\an8}<i>Oh these are our kids?</i>

191
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:01,042
{\an8}<i>Yes.</i>

192
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,667
{\an8}<i>How long have they been masseuses?</i>

193
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,250
{\an8}<i>How much for an hour?</i>

194
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:07,500
{\an8}<i>Three dollars</i>

195
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,083
{\an8}<i>Three dollars? Wow, that's some good money.</i>

196
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:15,292
{\an8}<i>Work eight hours and you'll have 24 dollars,</i>
<i>that's more than minimum wage.</i>

197
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:16,917
{\an8}<i>This is our reading corner.</i>

198
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:29,167
{\an8}<i>You can speak directly to me, not the camera.</i>

199
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:34,792
{\an8}<i>You have a strong understanding of</i>
<i>how children live</i>

200
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:39,167
{\an8}<i>and you have a passion for</i>
<i>making reading part of their lives.</i>

201
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:43,500
{\an8}<i>Can you tell us how you came to</i>
<i>love reading books?</i>

202
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:51,292
{\an8}<i>I've loved it since I was a teenager,</i>
<i>when I read a lot of romance novels.</i>

203
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:57,958
{\an8}<i>Reading can be so enjoyable,</i>
<i>you have fun because you get to be yourself.</i>

204
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:03,542
{\an8}<i>Then we opened Children's Village</i>
<i>and I began studying about children.</i>

205
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:09,875
{\an8}<i>I discovered that children often express</i>
<i>themselves through signals or cues.</i>

206
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:19,417
{\an8}<i>At the beginning I still had so many habits</i>
<i>from my traditional school days.</i>

207
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:23,625
{\an8}<i>I was so used to giving orders and</i>
<i>expecting obedience.</i>

208
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:30,417
{\an8}<i>That changed after I read about the Summerhill</i>
<i>teaching method. I wanted to listen.</i>

209
00:19:30,542 --> 00:19:39,833
{\an8}<i>That book taught me to look at a child's imaginings</i>
<i>and understand the good in them</i>

210
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:46,542
{\an8}<i>just as A.S. Neill, the founder of Summerhill</i>
<i>said children are inherently good,</i>

211
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:53,167
{\an8}<i>honest, and loving and trusting of others.</i>

212
00:19:54,625 --> 00:20:00,125
{\an8}<i>Now, we'd like you to speak about</i>
<i>Children's Village and the foundation.</i>

213
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:07,333
{\an8}<i>Things like how many students you have,</i>
<i>what they're like, where they're from.</i>

214
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:14,000
{\an8}<i>The Foundation For Children looks after</i>
<i>250 children.</i>

215
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,250
{\an8}<i>Our nursery has 40. The preschool has 60.</i>

216
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:20,750
{\an8}<i>And there are 150 in the Children's Village.</i>

217
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:28,417
{\an8}<i>Our nursery is named Sunflower Home and</i>
<i>cares for children between new-born and four.</i>

218
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:35,042
{\an8}<i>Most children the nursery takes in</i>
<i>have been abandoned, abused,</i>

219
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:40,375
{\an8}<i>and children whose</i>
<i>mothers are mentally unstable.</i>

220
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:46,375
{\an8}<i>Any condition, from depression to desire</i>
<i>to kill oneself or ones child,</i>

221
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:55,167
{\an8}<i>will have adverse mental effects on children.</i>
<i>That's the focus of Sunflower House.</i>

222
00:20:55,375 --> 00:21:01,958
{\an8}<i>When they grow old enough</i>
<i>they enter the Quilt House preschool</i>

223
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:07,625
{\an8}<i>At the Children's Village, we accept students</i>
<i>from the preschool as well as new students</i>

224
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:11,375
{\an8}<i>and their past shows itself in different ways.</i>

225
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:19,792
{\an8}<i>If a child came from poverty</i>
<i>but still had even a single parent who loved them</i>

226
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,292
{\an8}<i>they are very easy to raise.</i>

227
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:26,500
{\an8}<i>If they were loved before and we at the school</i>
<i>continue that, they are great.</i>

228
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:31,167
{\an8}<i>But if they were abandoned,</i>
<i>they will not trust us right away.</i>

229
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:38,125
{\an8}<i>From when they first have contact with us</i>
<i>that trust can take years to build.</i>

230
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:44,042
{\an8}<i>Then with children who experienced abuse,</i>
<i>it can take even longer</i>

231
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:48,708
{\an8}<i>in the case of sexual abuse,</i>
<i>maybe more than a decade.</i>

232
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:53,792
{\an8}<i>Mostly, my husband Pibhop looks after</i>
<i>Quilt House preschool.</i>

233
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,250
{\an8}<i>and the Sunflower Home nursery in Bangkok.</i>

234
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:01,583
{\an8}<i>As for me, I'm primarily in charge of</i>
<i>Children's Village School in Kanchanaburi.</i>

235
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:06,708
{\an8}<i>We spend most of our time apart because of</i>
<i>our respective responsibilities.</i>

236
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
{\an8}<i>Arrange your shoes neatly, kids.</i>

237
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,458
{\an8}<i>Take them off and arrange them.</i>

238
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:29,583
{\an8}<i>Make a circle.</i>

239
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:36,292
{\an8}<i>If they are ever away from water,</i>
<i>their skin will dry</i>

240
00:22:36,292 --> 00:22:38,292
{\an8}<i>they have to find somewhere damp.</i>

241
00:22:38,292 --> 00:22:43,792
{\an8}<i>Mom, my house has some jumping frogs</i>
<i>that stay in a pipe</i>

242
00:22:43,792 --> 00:22:47,375
{\an8}<i>when they come out I chase them back in.</i>

243
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:49,500
{\an8}<i>Why do you chase them?</i>

244
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:50,458
{\an8}<i>I'm scared.</i>

245
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:52,375
{\an8}<i>You're scared? Chased them with?</i>

246
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,083
{\an8}<i>Who else?</i>

247
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:54,958
{\an8}<i>Water.</i>

248
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:56,833
{\an8}<i>Any experiences?</i>

249
00:22:57,958 --> 00:22:59,042
{\an8}<i>Who's seen frogs.</i>

250
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:01,042
{\an8}<i>I've only seen tadpoles. Just joking.</i>

251
00:23:01,042 --> 00:23:01,792
{\an8}<i>Tadpoles.</i>

252
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,417
{\an8}<i>Are you ready to go look for some?</i>

253
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:05,958
{\an8}<i>Yes!</i>

254
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:07,083
{\an8}<i>Conditions.</i>

255
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:11,292
{\an8}<i>My first condition is</i>

256
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:16,583
{\an8}<i>don't be rough with them</i>

257
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,708
{\an8}<i>because they have</i>
<i>the same right to life as we do</i>

258
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,208
{\an8}<i>we need to love like our own.</i>

259
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:21,917
{\an8}<i>Alright?</i>

260
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:23,000
{\an8}<i>Yes.</i>

261
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:25,042
{\an8}<i>Over here first.</i>

262
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,167
{\an8}<i>Let's see these ponds here.</i>

263
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:35,042
{\an8}<i>We've found some. Found some water.</i>

264
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:36,875
{\an8}<i>What's living there?</i>

265
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:41,792
{\an8}<i>Sit first. Don't disturb the water. Survey first.</i>

266
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:48,833
{\an8}<i>Keep calm. Stay focused.</i>
<i>There, so many of them. Quiet!</i>

267
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:52,333
{\an8}<i>Look here.</i>

268
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,500
{\an8}<i>Gently.</i>

269
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:02,833
{\an8}<i>See how the tadpoles here are different</i>
<i>from the ones over there.</i>

270
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:05,375
{\an8}<i>You can see there are big differences.</i>

271
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,167
{\an8}<i>Linda, look at your tadpoles.</i>

272
00:24:07,542 --> 00:24:15,000
{\an8}<i>Why do they look like that?</i>
<i>Look at their tails, they're flatter.</i>

273
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,458
{\an8}<i>Who's next?</i>

274
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:20,333
{\an8}<i>This one is big.</i>

275
00:24:23,917 --> 00:24:25,375
{\an8}<i>Pink! Pink! Pink!</i>

276
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:27,417
{\an8}<i>Bring the magnifying glass.</i>

277
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:31,292
{\an8}<i>Pink is good. She caught so many!</i>

278
00:24:32,292 --> 00:24:35,125
{\an8}<i>That's enough, we won't be able to</i>
<i>take care of them all.</i>

279
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,375
{\an8}<i>Yes, I can, I'll live with them.</i>

280
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:40,042
{\an8}<i>Oh, they're a couple.</i>

281
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:47,208
{\an8}<i>Mom, only the black head ones</i>
<i>are tadpoles right?</i>

282
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:52,125
{\an8}<i>They're all tadpoles, but they grow up</i>
<i>to be different.</i>

283
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,875
{\an8}<i>In a sleepy pond somewhere</i>

284
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:58,208
{\an8}<i>there were four little tadpoles.</i>

285
00:24:58,708 --> 00:25:02,583
{\an8}<i>They hatched but could not find their mother.</i>

286
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:06,042
{\an8}<i>They wanted to see their mother so very badly.</i>

287
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:11,417
{\an8}<i>These four tadpoles swam and found</i>

288
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:15,167
{\an8}<i>a mother goby fish, and they said to her</i>

289
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:18,417
{\an8}<i>Mommy! Mommy!</i>

290
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:22,500
{\an8}<i>I am a mother Golden Goby, not your mother.</i>

291
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:26,500
{\an8}<i>And so our brave tadpoles swam on</i>

292
00:25:27,417 --> 00:25:32,875
{\an8}<i>until they found a mother with a white stomach</i>

293
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,750
{\an8}<i>and they said to her</i>

294
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,708
{\an8}<i>Mommy! Mommy!</i>

295
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:42,458
{\an8}<i>I am a mother crab. I am not your mother.</i>

296
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:47,292
{\an8}<i>And so our tadpoles kept on swimming</i>
<i>and called out.</i>

297
00:25:47,292 --> 00:25:51,250
{\an8}<i>Have you seen our mother?</i>

298
00:25:52,292 --> 00:25:56,458
{\an8}<i>I am a mother frog, children.</i>
<i>I am your mother.</i>

299
00:25:57,125 --> 00:26:00,208
{\an8}<i>I have been looking for you all day.</i>

300
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:04,625
{\an8}<i>I wonder why we don't look like our mother?</i>

301
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:09,833
{\an8}<i>One month later, the tadpoles had changed.</i>

302
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:12,125
{\an8}<i>They looked more like their mother.</i>

303
00:26:13,042 --> 00:26:16,542
{\an8}<i>And in the end the mother frog and</i>
<i>her tadpoles lived</i>

304
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:22,500
{\an8}<i>happily ever after in the sleepy pond</i>
<i>with the other animals.</i>

305
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:50,375
{\an8}<i>Is there anything you think we should add?</i>

306
00:26:51,292 --> 00:26:58,667
{\an8}<i>One. Mother Aew’s life. Showing her life. How</i>
<i>are we going to do that with our pop-up book?</i>

307
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:07,667
{\an8}<i>This is the background,</i>
<i>the most important parts will pop-up in front.</i>

308
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:11,208
{\an8}<i>- Mother Aew and Father Piak.</i>
<i>- Yes, Mom and Dad.</i>

309
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:14,792
{\an8}<i>Open it and they'll pop up.</i>

310
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:19,917
{\an8}<i>I'll help this group, you guys start coloring</i>
<i>when you're done drawing.</i>

311
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:28,542
{\an8}<i>There was a couple, who were deeply in love</i>
<i>from young to old age.</i>

312
00:27:28,792 --> 00:27:38,083
{\an8}<i>They shared the same views</i>
<i>and beliefs on... on education.</i>

313
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:39,958
{\an8}<i>What were they?</i>

314
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:42,333
{\an8}<i>To help children.</i>

315
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:46,625
{\an8}<i>To help orphans and poor children</i>
<i>who had no family.</i>

316
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:49,958
{\an8}<i>What did they decide to do?</i>

317
00:27:50,042 --> 00:27:55,667
{\an8}<i>To build the school and named it</i>
<i>Children's Village.</i>

318
00:27:55,667 --> 00:28:06,000
{\an8}<i>Okay, this is good, but let's think, did Mother</i>
<i>Aew and Father Piak encounter problems?</i>

319
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,875
{\an8}<i>Yes.</i>

320
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:09,625
{\an8}<i>They both did. What were they?</i>

321
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:15,750
{\an8}<i>Remember, they were setting up a very</i>
<i>different type of school compared to others.</i>

322
00:28:16,417 --> 00:28:30,042
{\an8}<i>Do you understand how? In normal schools here</i>
<i>children study according to a strict</i>

323
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:41,833
{\an8}<i>curriculum and focus on core subjects</i>
<i>without much choice at all. But Mom and Dad</i>

324
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:51,958
{\an8}<i>built this so that students could choose</i>
<i>what they wanted to study because</i>

325
00:28:52,042 --> 00:29:05,417
{\an8}<i>you excel at the things you enjoy. So, it's</i>
<i>very different, do you think society liked this?</i>

326
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:06,292
{\an8}<i>No.</i>

327
00:29:06,292 --> 00:29:10,833
{\an8}<i>The building of Children's Village</i>
<i>was not an easy task.</i>

328
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:15,417
{\an8}<i>Society was not accepting.</i>

329
00:29:16,792 --> 00:29:19,250
{\an8}<i>And why was that?</i>

330
00:29:20,167 --> 00:29:22,167
{\an8}<i>The Summerhill system.</i>

331
00:29:22,542 --> 00:29:25,583
{\an8}<i>They thought students had too much freedom.</i>

332
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:32,083
{\an8}<i>Did they believe that students here</i>
<i>could make their own decisions?</i>

333
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,042
{\an8}<i>No.</i>

334
00:29:33,042 --> 00:29:35,292
{\an8}<i>How are the kids at this school?</i>

335
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,667
{\an8}<i>Naughty. Carefree.</i>

336
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:40,125
{\an8}<i>They are, aren't they? Do you think</i>
<i>they make it hard on Mother Aew?</i>

337
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:41,667
{\an8}<i>Yes. For sure.</i>

338
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:44,583
{\an8}<i>Making her worry.</i>

339
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:46,333
{\an8}<i>Bicker.</i>

340
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:48,792
{\an8}<i>Fight.</i>

341
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,792
{\an8}<i>Climb and fall off trees.</i>

342
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,167
{\an8}<i>Break their arms and go to hospital.</i>

343
00:29:55,667 --> 00:30:00,792
{\an8}<i>Career skills, such as making furniture,</i>
<i>batik, what is it for?</i>

344
00:30:00,792 --> 00:30:02,583
{\an8}<i>What are the reasons for these classes?</i>

345
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:11,500
{\an8}<i>So the children can start to earn money to</i>
<i>help support their progress and education.</i>

346
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:18,292
{\an8}<i>Well done today, guys, well done. Tidy up.</i>

347
00:30:18,292 --> 00:30:20,333
{\an8}<i>Class, address Mother Penn.</i>

348
00:30:20,417 --> 00:30:23,833
{\an8}<i>Thank you, Mother Penn.</i>

349
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:24,917
{\an8}<i>Thank you. Dismissed.</i>

350
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,833
{\an8}<i>Measure against your frames, kids.</i>

351
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:40,208
{\an8}<i>Let's draw the pier.</i>

352
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:45,792
{\an8}<i>No path, we'll draw from in front of the gazebo,</i>
<i>this here, and some kids swimming...</i>

353
00:30:45,792 --> 00:30:47,292
{\an8}<i>Kids, listen up.</i>

354
00:30:48,042 --> 00:30:51,792
{\an8}<i>With batik, you need to use nice thick lines</i>

355
00:30:51,792 --> 00:30:57,208
{\an8}<i>If they aren't thick, when you draw on the wax,</i>
<i>there won't be any detail</i>

356
00:30:57,208 --> 00:30:59,250
{\an8}<i>It turns into one big line of wax.</i>

357
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:06,875
{\an8}<i>You can draw the hexagon building, kids playing,</i>
<i>sweeping, maybe some birds flying overhead</i>

358
00:31:06,917 --> 00:31:12,292
{\an8}<i>anything you've encountered here before.</i>
<i>Draw it as a story.</i>

359
00:31:12,917 --> 00:31:15,667
{\an8}<i>Alright, kids, do you know what this is?</i>

360
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:17,500
{\an8}<i>Wax.</i>

361
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:21,083
{\an8}<i>This is called a canting, or janting.</i>

362
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:28,250
{\an8}<i>Most of this batik equipment is from Indonesia.</i>

363
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:33,167
{\an8}<i>When the wax isn't hot enough, you can't</i>
<i>put it onto the cloth</i>

364
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:36,792
{\an8}<i>because it won't stop the paint</i>
<i>from mixing together.</i>

365
00:31:41,292 --> 00:31:42,458
{\an8}<i>Hold it upright, Biuw.</i>

366
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:44,042
{\an8}<i>More upright.</i>

367
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:47,875
{\an8}<i>Tilt it like this. About 45 degrees.</i>

368
00:31:50,292 --> 00:31:54,500
{\an8}<i>Which groups are ready and need</i>
<i>some paint now?</i>

369
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:00,875
{\an8}<i>This is called shading.</i>

370
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:08,333
{\an8}<i>Experiment with shading the colors.</i>
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

371
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:10,042
{\an8}<i>Adds beauty.</i>

372
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:14,042
{\an8}<i>Use a light hand, sir, watch out.</i>

373
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:16,042
{\an8}<i>This is fun, huh?</i>

374
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:20,958
{\an8}<i>Oh, we're gonna do something special.</i>
<i>When you're done.</i>

375
00:32:21,042 --> 00:32:21,917
{\an8}<i>What's that?</i>

376
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:22,958
{\an8}<i>Swim, right?</i>

377
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:24,292
{\an8}<i>We're gonna swim.</i>

378
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:54,250
{\an8}<i>And who else practiced?</i>

379
00:33:54,542 --> 00:33:56,708
{\an8}<i>Practiced? You mean dancing, Mom?</i>

380
00:33:56,792 --> 00:33:57,500
{\an8}<i>Yes.</i>

381
00:33:57,708 --> 00:33:59,167
{\an8}<i>Just six of us.</i>

382
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:05,958
{\an8}<i>When you dance in a big group</i>
<i>you have to all be in sync</i>

383
00:34:06,042 --> 00:34:10,417
{\an8}<i>up and down at the same time.</i>
<i>It takes a lot of practice</i>

384
00:34:10,417 --> 00:34:12,167
{\an8}<i>to get in sync like that.</i>

385
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:13,667
{\an8}<i>And beautiful.</i>

386
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:14,375
{\an8}<i>Yes.</i>

387
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:19,333
{\an8}<i>Remember, Pao, how others used to</i>

388
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,667
{\an8}<i>call you names?</i>

389
00:34:21,792 --> 00:34:22,417
{\an8}<i>Yes.</i>

390
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:24,625
{\an8}<i>Is it different now?</i>

391
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:25,708
{\an8}<i>Yes, Mom.</i>

392
00:34:27,542 --> 00:34:32,583
{\an8}<i>I remember at first I called you Mr. Pao</i>

393
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:36,583
{\an8}<i>because you were still a little boy</i>

394
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:39,375
{\an8}<i>but now I call you Ms. Pao.</i>

395
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,417
{\an8}<i>How do you feel about being...</i>

396
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:43,500
{\an8}<i>called.</i>

397
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:49,250
{\an8}<i>Yes, called things because of your gender.</i>

398
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:54,833
{\an8}<i>Even how I went from calling you Mr. to Ms.</i>
<i>because you changed.</i>

399
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:58,083
{\an8}<i>How do you feel?</i>

400
00:34:58,667 --> 00:35:01,208
{\an8}<i>I feel it's normal.</i>

401
00:35:02,792 --> 00:35:07,292
{\an8}<i>People still call me both things, girl or boy.</i>

402
00:35:07,292 --> 00:35:08,208
{\an8}<i>Yeah?</i>

403
00:35:14,542 --> 00:35:16,000
{\an8}<i>They still make fun of you?</i>

404
00:35:16,292 --> 00:35:17,917
{\an8}<i>Not really, Mom.</i>

405
00:35:19,042 --> 00:35:21,875
{\an8}<i>Some people say that I make a good girl.</i>

406
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:26,417
{\an8}<i>We live a democratic lifestyle in this school.</i>

407
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:30,958
{\an8}<i>We have to abide by the rules.</i>

408
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:34,042
{\an8}<i>We all make those rules together.</i>

409
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:39,500
{\an8}<i>We can make new rules, abolish old ones,</i>
<i>but it's always as a community.</i>

410
00:35:39,792 --> 00:35:43,833
{\an8}<i>Now the school has accepted</i>
<i>your right to choose and</i>

411
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:46,667
{\an8}<i>say you want to be a girl.</i>

412
00:35:48,542 --> 00:35:53,083
{\an8}<i>No one has opposed that,</i>
<i>they allowed you your choice</i>

413
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,375
{\an8}<i>and they respect it.</i>

414
00:35:54,542 --> 00:36:01,208
{\an8}<i>But if anyone ever opposes that right,</i>
<i>saying you can't choose</i>

415
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:06,500
{\an8}<i>and must be a boy.</i>
<i>They are infringing on your rights.</i>

416
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,458
{\an8}<i>You can report that,</i>

417
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:13,500
{\an8}<i>because it is your choice.</i>

418
00:36:13,667 --> 00:36:15,208
{\an8}<i>Your life.</i>

419
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:23,333
{\an8}<i>You haven't harmed or caused anyone hardship</i>

420
00:36:25,167 --> 00:36:27,625
{\an8}<i>so you can use that right to the fullest.</i>

421
00:36:28,542 --> 00:36:29,583
{\an8}<i>That's right Mom.</i>

422
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:52,042
{\an8}<i>Come on, kids, let's go.</i>

423
00:36:55,625 --> 00:37:00,375
{\an8}<i>I want to ask you guys something. Because,</i>
<i>today, we're learning about life and family.</i>

424
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:04,000
{\an8}<i>What phase of life are you in?</i>

425
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,833
{\an8}<i>Beginning, middle or end of childhood?</i>

426
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:09,833
{\an8}<i>Middle.</i>

427
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:11,875
{\an8}<i>The end, Mom.</i>

428
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:15,125
{\an8}<i>That's right, you're at the end</i>

429
00:37:15,417 --> 00:37:19,292
{\an8}<i>- and about to step into adolescence.</i>
<i>- adolescence</i>

430
00:37:19,292 --> 00:37:20,708
{\an8}<i>That's right.</i>

431
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:24,042
{\an8}<i>There will be a lot of changes to our bodies.</i>

432
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:29,167
{\an8}<i>Which changes will be very noticeable, kids?</i>

433
00:37:29,292 --> 00:37:30,250
{\an8}<i>Life?</i>

434
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,833
{\an8}<i>Sexual.</i>

435
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:34,667
{\an8}<i>Yes, sexuality. That's right.</i>

436
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,208
{\an8}<i>You'll both start to notice changes</i>
<i>when you start adolescence.</i>

437
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:48,208
{\an8}<i>It's good to know what those changes will be.</i>
<i>They're different for boys and girls.</i>

438
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:53,667
{\an8}<i>All sorts of things from your body hair</i>
<i>to your sexual organs.</i>

439
00:37:53,667 --> 00:38:00,333
{\an8}<i>That's right, and girl's chests will grow</i>
<i>because of increased muscle, fat</i>

440
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:02,292
{\an8}<i>and your lactation system.</i>

441
00:38:02,292 --> 00:38:08,333
{\an8}<i>First, put your arms through the straps and</i>
<i>adjust so it is level with your chest</i>

442
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:12,125
{\an8}<i>Dad, this must have to do with wet dreams.</i>

443
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:14,667
{\an8}<i>Dreaming that you pee your bed?</i>

444
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:21,667
{\an8}<i>Now, now, a wet dream is when semen is</i>
<i>excreted during sleep.</i>

445
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:29,500
{\an8}<i>Remember, kids, these changes are part of</i>
<i>growing up, and you should be ready.</i>

446
00:38:58,458 --> 00:39:00,250
{\an8}<i>No cavities.</i>

447
00:39:01,417 --> 00:39:02,625
{\an8}<i>Wide please.</i>

448
00:39:09,208 --> 00:39:10,958
{\an8}<i>All your teeth are good.</i>

449
00:39:11,667 --> 00:39:13,917
{\an8}<i>You've had some work done before.</i>

450
00:39:14,167 --> 00:39:15,542
{\an8}<i>Remember to brush.</i>

451
00:39:16,417 --> 00:39:18,417
{\an8}<i>Does this tooth up here hurt?</i>

452
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:24,875
{\an8}<i>Good teeth.</i>

453
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:25,708
{\an8}<i>Yes.</i>

454
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,625
{\an8}<i>Open wide.</i>

455
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:40,458
{\an8}<i>Look at that one there.</i>

456
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:42,750
{\an8}<i>What did it hit?</i>

457
00:39:42,917 --> 00:39:43,917
{\an8}<i>A pole.</i>

458
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:46,500
{\an8}<i>What?</i>

459
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,417
{\an8}<i>A pole.</i>

460
00:39:47,708 --> 00:39:49,583
{\an8}<i>What kind of pole?</i>

461
00:39:49,708 --> 00:39:50,583
{\an8}<i>Washing line.</i>

462
00:39:51,292 --> 00:39:52,667
{\an8}<i>You were climbing on it?</i>

463
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,333
{\an8}<i>You don't brush much do you?</i>

464
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:56,542
{\an8}<i>I do.</i>

465
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:04,583
{\an8}<i>We're done, but you have cavities, okay? You</i>
<i>have to keep brushing, and rinse after eating.</i>

466
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:10,625
{\an8}<i>They won't look in your eyes.</i>

467
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:14,167
{\an8}<i>Yeah, when you tell them to brush every day</i>
<i>they won't look you in the eye.</i>

468
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:18,542
{\an8}<i>All done?</i>

469
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,208
{\an8}<i>He's the last one?</i>

470
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:22,375
{\an8}<i>The rest are hiding.</i>

471
00:40:22,583 --> 00:40:24,458
{\an8}<i>Yeah, they rest are hiding.</i>

472
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:41,167
{\an8}<i>Massage the person in front of you.</i>
<i>Back up. Come on.</i>

473
00:40:44,417 --> 00:40:47,292
{\an8}<i>Not too close, my knees hurt.</i>

474
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:54,750
{\an8}<i>Drum along the arteries.</i>

475
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,417
{\an8}<i>Gets the blood going.</i>

476
00:40:57,708 --> 00:41:06,042
{\an8}<i>We've got a little announcement about</i>
<i>tomorrow's trip to make merit at the temple.</i>

477
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:11,250
{\an8}<i>You're going to dress as gods and angels.</i>

478
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:15,958
{\an8}<i>Did you hear that kids?</i>

479
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,292
{\an8}<i>You heard that?</i>

480
00:41:18,458 --> 00:41:26,042
{\an8}<i>Tomorrow morning, we will dress up and take</i>
<i>food to give to the monks.</i>

481
00:41:26,042 --> 00:41:31,958
{\an8}<i>We have to get ready early then at 10:00 a.m.</i>
<i>on the dot...</i>

482
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,708
{\an8}<i>wheels up.</i>

483
00:41:34,833 --> 00:41:39,500
{\an8}<i>We'll gather at the intersection to</i>
<i>make our procession.</i>

484
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:42,333
{\an8}<i>What are we doing, little gods and angels?</i>

485
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,125
{\an8}<i>We invited you down from heaven for this,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

486
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:52,458
{\an8}<i>Carry candles, that's right. And whom are we</i>
<i>carrying it to?</i>

487
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:57,500
{\an8}<i>Yes, to the monks. To honor them.</i>

488
00:41:57,708 --> 00:42:04,125
{\an8}<i>At the temple, hun, at Phuphong Temple.</i>
<i>We're taking food for them too.</i>

489
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:10,958
{\an8}<i>Once there, we'll listen to the monks chant</i>
<i>to give us blessings.</i>

490
00:42:10,958 --> 00:42:15,625
{\an8}<i>It's for the beginning of Lent, an important day.</i>

491
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:20,833
{\an8}<i>Something else, kids,</i>
<i>we're making the candles tonight.</i>

492
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:27,625
{\an8}<i>Decorating them, so anyone who is free come</i>
<i>and help. It's in Mother Nee's room.</i>

493
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:32,833
{\an8}<i>We're going to arrange the flowers and also</i>
<i>make gift packages.</i>

494
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:34,958
{\an8}<i>Do you know what the gifts are for, kids?</i>

495
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:45,667
{\an8}<i>They symbolize giving, so we're going to give</i>
<i>the senior monk living essentials.</i>

496
00:42:45,667 --> 00:42:47,625
{\an8}<i>During Lent...</i>

497
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:52,667
{\an8}<i>monks cannot go anywhere outside their temples.</i>

498
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:59,083
{\an8}<i>So, they need enough living essentials to</i>
<i>last them three months.</i>

499
00:42:59,333 --> 00:43:04,083
{\an8}<i>Buddhists take them food and other things and</i>
<i>the monks can stay inside</i>

500
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:12,042
{\an8}<i>and they don't have to come out for alms</i>
<i>as they do the rest of the year.</i>

501
00:43:12,042 --> 00:43:19,083
{\an8}<i>It's a tradition to give to the monks at</i>
<i>the beginning of Lent, and in return they will</i>

502
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:24,625
{\an8}<i>bless us and grant forgiveness, but also tell us</i>
<i>a story, kids. What story is that?</i>

503
00:43:24,625 --> 00:43:26,333
{\an8}<i>Lord Buddha's story.</i>

504
00:43:26,792 --> 00:43:28,375
{\an8}<i>His enlightenment!</i>

505
00:43:28,625 --> 00:43:33,417
{\an8}<i>We're going to walk with the candles after</i>
<i>seeing the monks during the day.</i>

506
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:44,000
{\an8}<i>Taking candles to temple reminds us of our open</i>
<i>and bright minds</i>

507
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,083
{\an8}<i>just like these big, bright candles.</i>

508
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:52,958
{\an8}<i>In Buddha's era there was no electricity</i>
<i>so candles were what gave light.</i>

509
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,625
{\an8}<i>Why do we walk three rounds?</i>

510
00:43:56,917 --> 00:44:01,250
{\an8}<i>We walk around the temple three times,</i>
<i>the first is to honor Lord Buddha</i>

511
00:44:01,417 --> 00:44:03,375
{\an8}<i>The second to honor his teachings.</i>

512
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:08,083
{\an8}<i>The third is to honor the monks.</i>

513
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:16,042
{\an8}<i>Thank you Mother Aew.</i>

514
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:17,750
{\an8}<i>You're welcome.</i>

515
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,958
{\an8}<i>Does anybody else want to bring something up?</i>

516
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:30,917
{\an8}<i>Go ahead Mother Joom?</i>

517
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:33,417
{\an8}<i>Now that we have rescinded the old punishment</i>

518
00:44:33,417 --> 00:44:39,083
{\an8}<i>I'd like to propose a new one,</i>
<i>so to recap from last time</i>

519
00:44:39,792 --> 00:44:42,792
{\an8}<i>Students miss a day of movies for</i>
<i>every 10 pieces of litter found.</i>

520
00:44:43,167 --> 00:44:46,417
{\an8}<i>Does anyone else have any proposals?</i>

521
00:44:46,667 --> 00:44:47,417
{\an8}<i>Uoom?</i>

522
00:44:47,458 --> 00:44:52,458
{\an8}<i>I understand the issue, but also know that</i>
<i>everyone here loves watching movies.</i>

523
00:44:52,458 --> 00:44:55,208
{\an8}<i>Could the punishment be missing only one movie</i>
<i>instead of a whole day of movies?</i>

524
00:44:55,208 --> 00:44:57,250
{\an8}<i>One movie per 10 pieces.</i>

525
00:44:57,292 --> 00:45:03,167
{\an8}<i>There are two types of movie session,</i>
<i>weekends and weekday evenings.</i>

526
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:06,750
{\an8}<i>During weekends each session has four movies</i>

527
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:13,417
{\an8}<i>while weekday evenings we show episodic series.</i>

528
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:21,750
{\an8}<i>I want to ask how long the weekday evening</i>
<i>sessions are. Is it an hour, hour and a half?</i>

529
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:27,000
{\an8}<i>Goes from about 8:30p.m. to 9:30p.m.</i>

530
00:45:27,667 --> 00:45:34,792
{\an8}<i>I can understand the request to change it,</i>
<i>so my recommendation is</i>

531
00:45:34,917 --> 00:45:39,125
{\an8}<i>missing only 30 minutes on weekday evenings</i>
<i>after a garbage collecting session.</i>

532
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:44,625
{\an8}<i>Does anyone else have any input like Mother Aew?</i>

533
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:48,000
{\an8}<i>Uoom! You're going to push for it?</i>

534
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,542
{\an8}<i>I would like to make some changes.</i>

535
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:52,458
{\an8}<i>You're battling Mother Aew today.</i>

536
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:59,708
{\an8}<i>Well I think on weekdays we should miss entire</i>
<i>sessions but weekends we miss just one movie.</i>

537
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:03,500
{\an8}<i>Mother Aew, would you like to add anything?</i>

538
00:46:04,625 --> 00:46:07,125
{\an8}<i>I agree about one movie per day on weekends</i>

539
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:11,333
{\an8}<i>but for weekdays I still think 30 minutes</i>
<i>after cleaning up.</i>

540
00:46:11,875 --> 00:46:14,083
{\an8}<i>That's just missing half the session.</i>

541
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:16,792
{\an8}<i>Top, what would you like to say?</i>

542
00:46:18,625 --> 00:46:27,500
{\an8}<i>Mom, I think kids will still litter if they know</i>
<i>they still get 30 minutes.</i>

543
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,292
{\an8}<i>They'll use the garbage cans</i>
<i>if the punishment is harsher.</i>

544
00:46:32,917 --> 00:46:38,417
{\an8}<i>I'll explain. This council was not made as</i>
<i>a place of punishment.</i>

545
00:46:38,417 --> 00:46:41,792
{\an8}<i>It is here to build discipline.</i>

546
00:46:42,125 --> 00:46:48,167
{\an8}<i>But when discipline is lacking we need to</i>
<i>do like we are now to change our behavior.</i>

547
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:56,667
{\an8}<i>Punishments are for continuous bad behavior.</i>
<i>If littering is reduced, so will the punishments.</i>

548
00:46:58,458 --> 00:47:00,792
{\an8}<i>I do not agree with Mother Aew on that</i>

549
00:47:00,792 --> 00:47:06,875
{\an8}<i>because the older kids won't help clean,</i>
<i>but still watch.</i>

550
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:10,458
{\an8}<i>They'll use the younger kids.</i>

551
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:13,708
{\an8}<i>We have a retort from our moderator.</i>

552
00:47:13,708 --> 00:47:14,750
{\an8}<i>Go ahead Khai Hin.</i>

553
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:28,125
{\an8}<i>It's making sense now, but I do agree with</i>
<i>Joom because honestly I wouldn't pick up trash.</i>

554
00:47:28,667 --> 00:47:37,958
{\an8}<i>If I may defend. I think that if someone</i>
<i>admits their wrongs, they should be forgiven.</i>

555
00:47:38,833 --> 00:47:42,208
{\an8}<i>Who is in favor of the joint proposal from</i>
<i>Uoom and Joom? Raise your hands.</i>

556
00:47:49,208 --> 00:47:51,292
{\an8}<i>Who is in favor of Mother Aew?</i>

557
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:08,458
{\an8}<i>The results, Mother Aew's proposal</i>
<i>received 27 votes.</i>

558
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:17,542
{\an8}<i>Joom and Oum's proposal got 56 votes</i>
<i>and passes.</i>

559
00:48:24,417 --> 00:48:28,375
{\an8}<i>Okay, let's go right into a vote for</i>
<i>next meeting's mediators.</i>

560
00:48:57,333 --> 00:49:00,125
{\an8}<i>Today, I have an announcement for you.</i>

561
00:49:00,417 --> 00:49:09,375
{\an8}<i>We're going to go get flu vaccinations.</i>
<i>The hospital has donated 80 to us.</i>

562
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:16,917
{\an8}<i>These vaccines are over $30 each. If you don't</i>
<i>want one, I'll remove your name from the list.</i>

563
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:23,250
{\an8}<i>There are less than 100 vaccines left from 6,000.</i>

564
00:49:23,917 --> 00:49:26,292
{\an8}<i>They've given Children's Village the opportunity.</i>

565
00:49:26,292 --> 00:49:30,708
{\an8}<i>If we don't want it, it can be given to</i>
<i>another school.</i>

566
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:37,583
{\an8}<i>Alright, make sure you tell me if you aren't</i>
<i>going so I can prepare the right documentation.</i>

567
00:49:38,042 --> 00:49:39,208
{\an8}<i>Are you guys going?</i>

568
00:49:39,292 --> 00:49:40,458
{\an8}<i>Yes!</i>

569
00:49:40,542 --> 00:49:42,125
{\an8}<i>I can't hear you, are you going?!</i>

570
00:49:42,125 --> 00:49:43,792
{\an8}<i>Yes!</i>

571
00:49:52,875 --> 00:49:57,125
{\an8}<i>Hurry, kids, you're going to get shots today.</i>

572
00:49:57,583 --> 00:49:59,208
{\an8}<i>Mom, I'm scared I'll cry.</i>

573
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:02,500
{\an8}<i>You'll be fine, just look away.</i>

574
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,458
{\an8}<i>Can I have a numbing shot first?</i>

575
00:50:04,667 --> 00:50:08,958
{\an8}<i>No, then you'd get two shots. One is plenty.</i>

576
00:50:09,542 --> 00:50:13,375
{\an8}<i>Mom, are the high school students</i>
<i>coming for vaccines with us?</i>

577
00:50:13,542 --> 00:50:16,083
{\an8}<i>Yes. Everyone will.</i>

578
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,542
{\an8}<i>Grownups too?</i>

579
00:50:17,542 --> 00:50:18,792
{\an8}<i>Yep, some.</i>

580
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,917
{\an8}<i>High schoolers?</i>

581
00:50:20,958 --> 00:50:24,083
{\an8}<i>They may go on another day because</i>
<i>there are a lot of us.</i>

582
00:50:24,167 --> 00:50:25,333
{\an8}<i>The hospital is going to break.</i>

583
00:50:25,792 --> 00:50:27,250
{\an8}<i>It'll explode. Boom.</i>

584
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:30,792
{\an8}<i>So many kids,</i>
<i>the nurses have no idea what's coming.</i>

585
00:50:31,792 --> 00:50:34,917
{\an8}<i>Come on, aren't you embarrassed?</i>
<i>Close your eyes and turn away.</i>

586
00:50:36,042 --> 00:50:41,750
{\an8}<i>Close your eyes. Trust me.</i>
<i>Lift your arm up a bit. Hold her.</i>

587
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:46,000
{\an8}<i>Look at my face, come on.</i>
<i>Nope, he doesn't want it.</i>

588
00:50:46,208 --> 00:50:47,000
{\an8}<i>Again.</i>

589
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,042
{\an8}<i>Hold him.</i>

590
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,583
{\an8}<i>No problem.</i>

591
00:50:50,583 --> 00:50:51,583
{\an8}<i>I don't want it.</i>

592
00:50:51,583 --> 00:50:53,667
{\an8}<i>Man, I'm so nervous!</i>

593
00:50:54,333 --> 00:50:55,875
{\an8}<i>It's in. It's in!</i>

594
00:50:57,625 --> 00:50:59,875
{\an8}<i>There, all done.</i>

595
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,333
{\an8}<i>Well done.</i>

596
00:51:02,042 --> 00:51:04,750
{\an8}<i>All done. Hold this down.</i>

597
00:51:04,917 --> 00:51:05,833
{\an8}<i>You're done.</i>

598
00:51:05,917 --> 00:51:07,083
{\an8}<i>Press here.</i>

599
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,917
{\an8}<i>Don't be scared! Don't be scared!</i>

600
00:51:13,042 --> 00:51:14,167
{\an8}<i>Don't move!</i>

601
00:51:14,458 --> 00:51:16,917
{\an8}<i>Hold her as tightly as you can, okay?</i>

602
00:51:16,917 --> 00:51:18,125
{\an8}<i>Don't move, Hun.</i>

603
00:51:18,958 --> 00:51:20,958
{\an8}<i>Hold her tight. Don't tense.</i>

604
00:51:21,833 --> 00:51:23,250
{\an8}<i>Okay.</i>

605
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,500
{\an8}<i>Hold him. Hug him tight.</i>

606
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:29,042
{\an8}<i>Don't move away. Don't move away.</i>

607
00:51:29,542 --> 00:51:30,167
{\an8}<i>Don't tense.</i>

608
00:51:30,167 --> 00:51:32,042
{\an8}<i>Don't move. Don't tense. Almost done.</i>

609
00:51:32,042 --> 00:51:35,625
{\an8}<i>Done. Don't tense, or the vaccine</i>
<i>won't flow into your system.</i>

610
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:38,125
{\an8}<i>There, very good. Well done.</i>

611
00:51:41,667 --> 00:51:44,583
{\an8}<i>Well, did it hurt?</i>

612
00:51:44,583 --> 00:51:45,792
{\an8}<i>No.</i>

613
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:46,583
{\an8}<i>Yes.</i>

614
00:51:46,667 --> 00:51:47,583
{\an8}<i>Yes.</i>

615
00:51:47,667 --> 00:51:48,708
{\an8}<i>No!</i>

616
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:49,708
{\an8}<i>Did not!</i>

617
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:51,625
{\an8}<i>No? How about another?</i>

618
00:51:51,833 --> 00:51:53,208
{\an8}<i>No! No!</i>

619
00:51:53,375 --> 00:51:54,333
{\an8}<i>No!!!</i>

620
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:58,208
{\an8}<i>Thank you very much!</i>

621
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:10,083
{\an8}<i>Go.</i>

622
00:52:11,833 --> 00:52:13,125
{\an8}<i>This row here.</i>

623
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,125
{\an8}<i>This row, Bovy and Tam will swap.</i>

624
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:18,625
{\an8}<i>One. Two. Three.</i>

625
00:52:18,667 --> 00:52:23,667
{\an8}<i>Turn. Middle. Pinch. Turn. Up.</i>

626
00:52:23,958 --> 00:52:25,125
{\an8}<i>This?</i>

627
00:52:25,292 --> 00:52:28,625
{\an8}<i>Yes, go. Lift.</i>

628
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,333
{\an8}<i>Yes, usually you aren't synced.</i>

629
00:52:33,667 --> 00:52:34,667
{\an8}<i>Five times.</i>

630
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:36,458
{\an8}<i>Three.</i>

631
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:38,667
{\an8}<i>Four.</i>

632
00:52:39,458 --> 00:52:43,250
{\an8}<i>We have to fix your hands, get them synced.</i>

633
00:52:43,708 --> 00:52:45,792
{\an8}<i>In. Out.</i>

634
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:47,667
{\an8}<i>In. Out.</i>

635
00:52:47,708 --> 00:52:48,542
{\an8}<i>Let's see.</i>

636
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:56,500
{\an8}<i>They follow your legs. In and in.</i>
<i>Out and out with the hands.</i>

637
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:59,208
{\an8}<i>This is in. This is out. This is in.</i>

638
00:52:59,875 --> 00:53:01,458
{\an8}<i>Trumpet move.</i>

639
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,875
{\an8}<i>You do this.</i>

640
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:10,833
{\an8}<i>Move. Move your butt.</i>

641
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,792
{\an8}<i>What?</i>

642
00:53:13,792 --> 00:53:16,000
{\an8}<i>Your leg goes to the back.</i>

643
00:53:18,417 --> 00:53:22,250
{\an8}<i>Pinch up. Pinch down.</i>

644
00:53:22,917 --> 00:53:27,125
{\an8}<i>Pinch up. Pinch down.</i>

645
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:29,500
{\an8}<i>Here's a move.</i>

646
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,750
{\an8}<i>Sway the hips.</i>

647
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:33,417
{\an8}<i>Sway the hips.</i>

648
00:53:34,417 --> 00:53:35,208
{\an8}<i>You got it?</i>

649
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:38,250
{\an8}<i>One leg has to be forward to do it.</i>

650
00:53:48,292 --> 00:53:50,583
{\an8}<i>You're all drunk, enough, drunks!</i>

651
00:53:52,542 --> 00:53:54,583
{\an8}<i>Everyone's gone crazy.</i>

652
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:22,333
{\an8}<i>Girls, if you have a family,</i>
<i>if you get married, be ready.</i>

653
00:54:22,542 --> 00:54:26,917
{\an8}<i>If you have a child you will go through this.</i>

654
00:54:27,708 --> 00:54:31,250
{\an8}<i>This is giving birth the natural way.</i>

655
00:54:32,125 --> 00:54:33,250
{\an8}<i>Let's see.</i>

656
00:54:34,667 --> 00:54:35,750
{\an8}<i>It doesn't hurt, Mom?</i>

657
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,208
{\an8}<i>Yes, it definitely hurts.</i>

658
00:54:40,083 --> 00:54:42,292
{\an8}<i>This is a natural birth.</i>

659
00:54:43,042 --> 00:54:45,000
{\an8}<i>That is the birthing canal.</i>

660
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:46,750
{\an8}<i>That is the birthing canal.</i>

661
00:54:46,792 --> 00:54:50,083
{\an8}<i>They have to cut it because</i>
<i>if you only push it out</i>

662
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:54,042
{\an8}<i>it can tear all the way to the</i>
<i>bum and that's dangerous.</i>

663
00:55:00,583 --> 00:55:03,000
{\an8}<i>Watch, watch. It's started.</i>

664
00:55:04,708 --> 00:55:07,083
{\an8}<i>Whoa, that's crazy.</i>

665
00:55:10,917 --> 00:55:13,000
{\an8}<i>It's coming. They're pulling it.</i>

666
00:55:13,042 --> 00:55:16,125
{\an8}<i>- What do you think?</i>
<i>- There's a lot of blood.</i>

667
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:17,542
{\an8}<i>Is she losing a lot?</i>

668
00:55:17,583 --> 00:55:19,333
{\an8}<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- Yes, a lot.</i>

669
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:22,417
{\an8}<i>It hurts, kids. There is pain.</i>

670
00:55:23,417 --> 00:55:26,708
{\an8}<i>But that pain is attached to love.</i>

671
00:55:26,833 --> 00:55:30,417
{\an8}<i>The pain doesn't matter as much as</i>
<i>the wellbeing of your child.</i>

672
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:34,625
{\an8}<i>Do you remember the name of</i>
<i>the grade 2 puppet show?</i>

673
00:55:34,625 --> 00:55:37,208
{\an8}<i>Tadpoles Without a Mom.</i>

674
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,708
{\an8}<i>Tadpoles Without a?</i>

675
00:55:38,833 --> 00:55:39,917
{\an8}<i>Mom!</i>

676
00:55:41,125 --> 00:55:43,625
{\an8}<i>I've got something here. The tadpoles.</i>

677
00:55:43,875 --> 00:55:49,083
{\an8}<i>I want to ask you, what would happen</i>
<i>if the tadpoles in Tadpoles Without a Mom</i>

678
00:55:50,083 --> 00:55:52,958
{\an8}<i>didn't find their mom.</i>

679
00:55:54,542 --> 00:55:56,333
{\an8}<i>Raise your hands.</i>

680
00:55:58,458 --> 00:55:59,125
{\an8}<i>Sad.</i>

681
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,417
{\an8}<i>They'd feel sad.</i>

682
00:56:00,917 --> 00:56:01,667
{\an8}<i>Die.</i>

683
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,458
{\an8}<i>They'd die because?</i>

684
00:56:03,792 --> 00:56:05,375
{\an8}<i>Because they had no mom.</i>

685
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,292
{\an8}<i>They'd die for sure without their mother. Any others?</i>

686
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:10,458
{\an8}<i>They'd cry.</i>

687
00:56:10,542 --> 00:56:11,792
{\an8}<i>They'd cry.</i>

688
00:56:12,208 --> 00:56:13,833
{\an8}<i>No one to protect them.</i>

689
00:56:14,167 --> 00:56:18,250
{\an8}<i>There's no one there to help protect</i>
<i>and look after them, right?</i>

690
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:21,750
{\an8}<i>Who else? What would happen to them?</i>

691
00:56:21,792 --> 00:56:23,500
{\an8}<i>- Endure.</i>
<i>- Endure!</i>

692
00:56:23,542 --> 00:56:26,500
{\an8}<i>Keep looking and one day we'll find her.</i>

693
00:56:26,958 --> 00:56:31,000
{\an8}<i>Life can take us anywhere.</i>

694
00:56:32,292 --> 00:56:36,333
{\an8}<i>Children's Village wants to give you</i>
<i>the hope that</i>

695
00:56:36,667 --> 00:56:42,000
{\an8}<i>there could be a day that you see</i>
<i>your parents again. If they're still alive.</i>

696
00:56:42,292 --> 00:56:44,417
{\an8}<i>The tadpoles.</i>

697
00:56:46,208 --> 00:56:52,500
{\an8}<i>They can survive.</i>
<i>If they know how to look after themselves.</i>

698
00:56:54,458 --> 00:56:56,250
{\an8}<i>We have to draw a birth?</i>

699
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:57,083
{\an8}<i>Yes.</i>

700
00:56:57,792 --> 00:57:03,708
{\an8}<i>Miss, I took the time to forget</i>
<i>what a birth looked like, but now...</i>

701
00:57:04,542 --> 00:57:09,792
{\an8}<i>Well... it's to show you guys</i>
<i>what your mother went through to give birth to you.</i>

702
00:57:10,708 --> 00:57:14,500
{\an8}<i>Okay, illustrate the feelings you have for your mom.</i>

703
00:57:15,208 --> 00:57:18,083
{\an8}<i>Mother Koy, may I draw a pregnant lady instead?</i>

704
00:57:18,375 --> 00:57:20,208
{\an8}<i>Yes, you can if you want.</i>

705
00:57:20,292 --> 00:57:24,708
{\an8}<i>Afterwards we're going over how we are born, okay?</i>

706
00:57:32,167 --> 00:57:38,083
{\an8}<i>Where was I before I was born? Before we are</i>
<i>born we are just a baby inside our mother's womb.</i>

707
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:45,417
{\an8}<i>Before that I was a smaller baby</i>
<i>that was still growing.</i>

708
00:57:45,792 --> 00:57:57,125
{\an8}<i>Before that I was a small group of cells made</i>
<i>from combining cells from my mom and dad.</i>

709
00:57:57,458 --> 00:58:10,792
{\an8}<i>Even before my parents met I</i>
<i>existed as a part of their dreams.</i>

710
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:26,667
{\an8}<i>So generous taking all this stuff for them.</i>

711
00:58:26,958 --> 00:58:29,833
{\an8}<i>- Mom, we are driving in Mother Aew's van?</i>
<i>- Yeah. Good eh?</i>

712
00:58:29,875 --> 00:58:31,958
{\an8}<i>I rode in it once.</i>

713
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,458
{\an8}<i>My arms!</i>

714
00:58:38,208 --> 00:58:40,833
{\an8}<i>The drive will take about four hours, Mom.</i>

715
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:51,583
{\an8}<i>What's the first thing you are going to</i>
<i>say when you meet your mom?</i>

716
00:58:51,625 --> 00:58:52,625
{\an8}<i>Hello.</i>

717
00:58:52,917 --> 00:58:54,083
{\an8}<i>Hello.</i>

718
00:59:00,083 --> 00:59:03,958
{\an8}<i>When you brought Biuw and Brif to us,</i>
<i>you were in Nakhon Prathom?</i>

719
00:59:04,417 --> 00:59:07,542
{\an8}<i>No, I was in Bor Tong then too,</i>

720
00:59:07,583 --> 00:59:10,458
{\an8}<i>and I came to Nakhon Prathom</i>
<i>and took them to your orphanage.</i>

721
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:14,958
{\an8}<i>I let them stay there and then knew</i>
<i>it would be better for them to study in Children's Village.</i>

722
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:16,708
{\an8}<i>They were...</i>

723
00:59:17,083 --> 00:59:19,333
{\an8}<i>two-and-a-half when they left.</i>

724
00:59:20,375 --> 00:59:21,667
{\an8}<i>They're twins?</i>

725
00:59:21,708 --> 00:59:23,125
{\an8}<i>Yes, twin boy and girl.</i>

726
00:59:23,125 --> 00:59:25,667
{\an8}<i>Oh, they were born on the same day?</i>

727
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,125
{\an8}<i>Same time.</i>

728
00:59:27,167 --> 00:59:29,875
{\an8}<i>Oh, no wonder they look alike.</i>

729
00:59:30,417 --> 00:59:34,625
{\an8}<i>Mom, shall we go?</i>
<i>Go and see their mother's house?</i>

730
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:40,208
{\an8}<i>You see how your parents are living?</i>

731
00:59:42,625 --> 00:59:44,083
{\an8}<i>What water do you use?</i>

732
00:59:44,375 --> 00:59:45,792
{\an8}<i>Where is your water from?</i>

733
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:48,625
{\an8}<i>We collect rainwater in the drum over there.</i>

734
00:59:48,667 --> 00:59:49,417
{\an8}<i>Oh.</i>

735
00:59:49,792 --> 00:59:52,042
{\an8}<i>Dad, do you rent this house?</i>

736
00:59:52,583 --> 00:59:54,208
{\an8}<i>No, it belongs to</i>

737
00:59:54,667 --> 00:59:55,625
{\an8}<i>our employer.</i>

738
00:59:56,208 --> 00:59:57,458
{\an8}<i>Who, Mom?</i>

739
00:59:57,625 --> 00:59:58,833
{\an8}<i>His employer.</i>

740
00:59:59,125 --> 01:00:00,667
{\an8}<i>The sugarcane owner.</i>

741
01:00:00,792 --> 01:00:02,875
{\an8}<i>Do you earn enough to live?</i>

742
01:00:03,583 --> 01:00:06,042
{\an8}<i>They give us some. It depends.</i>

743
01:00:06,625 --> 01:00:08,500
{\an8}<i>They give advances sometimes.</i>

744
01:00:09,375 --> 01:00:10,583
{\an8}<i>What's that?</i>

745
01:00:10,708 --> 01:00:11,417
{\an8}<i>Money.</i>

746
01:00:11,833 --> 01:00:13,042
{\an8}<i>Here comes the van.</i>

747
01:00:13,417 --> 01:00:15,500
{\an8}<i>Dad, do you have enough blankets?</i>

748
01:00:16,708 --> 01:00:17,875
{\an8}<i>Huh?</i>

749
01:00:18,333 --> 01:00:19,583
{\an8}<i>He didn't hear.</i>

750
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,750
{\an8}<i>They brought you some blankets.</i>

751
01:00:21,792 --> 01:00:22,833
{\an8}<i>Go close and ask.</i>

752
01:00:22,958 --> 01:00:24,250
{\an8}<i>I see a small blanket.</i>

753
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:27,167
{\an8}<i>How about the ones you brought?</i>

754
01:00:27,167 --> 01:00:31,375
{\an8}<i>The blankets I brought you are</i>
<i>bigger than the ones you have. They're huge.</i>

755
01:00:41,708 --> 01:00:43,208
{\an8}<i>This pole is breaking.</i>

756
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:46,250
{\an8}<i>I hit it with the tractor.</i>

757
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:47,625
{\an8}<i>Why?</i>

758
01:00:47,625 --> 01:00:48,833
{\an8}<i>The brakes are bad.</i>

759
01:00:49,167 --> 01:00:50,250
{\an8}<i>Couldn't stop.</i>

760
01:00:50,583 --> 01:00:52,208
{\an8}<i>Good thing you are ok.</i>

761
01:00:54,208 --> 01:00:56,375
{\an8}<i>Right, should we start unloading?</i>

762
01:00:57,667 --> 01:00:59,083
{\an8}<i>Anything for Dad?</i>

763
01:00:59,125 --> 01:01:01,833
{\an8}<i>You know she brought a doll for them?</i>

764
01:01:03,542 --> 01:01:06,542
{\an8}<i>What's this? Looks like clothes for your dad.</i>

765
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:08,250
{\an8}<i>Not sure if it'll fit him.</i>

766
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,458
{\an8}<i>You give this to him.</i>

767
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:15,042
{\an8}<i>Your parents will have some snacks to eat.</i>

768
01:01:15,875 --> 01:01:17,958
{\an8}<i>Is that a bra for your mom?</i>

769
01:01:21,042 --> 01:01:22,625
{\an8}<i>Brif, help me with this.</i>

770
01:01:23,167 --> 01:01:24,750
{\an8}<i>My arms are tired.</i>

771
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:26,500
{\an8}<i>Do you have their birth certificates?</i>

772
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:35,292
{\an8}<i>Mom, I will leave my doll</i>
<i>here with you for when I visit.</i>

773
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:39,542
{\an8}<i>I've had the doll since I was little.</i>
<i>Since I first went to school.</i>

774
01:01:39,875 --> 01:01:41,250
{\an8}<i>I'll look after it.</i>

775
01:01:42,042 --> 01:01:43,250
{\an8}<i>For when you come back.</i>

776
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:47,875
{\an8}<i>Give me a kiss.</i>

777
01:01:49,458 --> 01:01:50,625
{\an8}<i>Missed you.</i>

778
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:52,708
{\an8}<i>Really missed you two.</i>

779
01:01:56,583 --> 01:01:57,875
{\an8}<i>Is the ripped page in there?</i>

780
01:01:58,042 --> 01:01:59,417
{\an8}<i>Dad needs to sign this.</i>

781
01:01:59,792 --> 01:02:01,167
{\an8}<i>He can't write.</i>

782
01:02:01,542 --> 01:02:02,833
{\an8}<i>Spell his name please.</i>

783
01:02:04,167 --> 01:02:05,750
{\an8}<i>I'll let Biu write it for him.</i>

784
01:02:05,792 --> 01:02:08,792
{\an8}<i>All this stuff we brought is for you, okay?</i>

785
01:02:08,833 --> 01:02:12,167
{\an8}<i>Don't sell it for booze, I'll be very upset.</i>

786
01:02:12,958 --> 01:02:15,292
{\an8}<i>This stuff can last you a while</i>
<i>so you can save.</i>

787
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,958
{\an8}<i>To improve your situation.</i>

788
01:02:18,292 --> 01:02:19,875
{\an8}<i>Mom, there is tobacco everywhere.</i>

789
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,292
{\an8}<i>Tobacco huh?</i>

790
01:02:23,958 --> 01:02:26,125
{\an8}<i>We're going to take</i>
<i>some of the stuff in Mom's room.</i>

791
01:02:31,917 --> 01:02:34,333
{\an8}<i>Brif, take this blanket in.</i>

792
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:40,875
{\an8}<i>Look, look, its alcohol.</i>

793
01:02:43,667 --> 01:02:45,500
{\an8}<i>Tell Mom.</i>

794
01:02:46,458 --> 01:02:48,333
{\an8}<i>Mom, a bottle.</i>

795
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:49,917
{\an8}<i>Mom</i>

796
01:02:50,625 --> 01:02:51,542
{\an8}<i>Bottle.</i>

797
01:02:53,708 --> 01:02:55,292
{\an8}<i>Put it back inside.</i>

798
01:02:57,167 --> 01:02:58,833
{\an8}<i>Dad said put it back.</i>

799
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,917
{\an8}<i>And how much do you make per day?</i>

800
01:03:05,042 --> 01:03:07,792
{\an8}<i>Do you work in the sugarcane?</i>

801
01:03:07,833 --> 01:03:10,250
{\an8}<i>If we're hired outside we get $6.00.</i>

802
01:03:10,292 --> 01:03:12,958
{\an8}<i>Why do they give you so little after so long?</i>

803
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,625
{\an8}<i>They consider our food and house as payment.</i>

804
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:17,375
{\an8}<i>They bring you food?</i>

805
01:03:17,417 --> 01:03:22,792
{\an8}<i>They just give us rice.</i>
<i>They'll bring us drinks, tobacco and other things</i>

806
01:03:23,125 --> 01:03:26,333
{\an8}<i>and give us 60 cents, sometimes $1.50.</i>

807
01:03:26,917 --> 01:03:30,667
{\an8}<i>On days we work hard</i>
<i>they may give us $3.00 to spend</i>

808
01:03:30,708 --> 01:03:32,500
{\an8}<i>but it's taken out of our pay.</i>

809
01:03:32,958 --> 01:03:34,292
{\an8}<i>But we never really see cash.</i>

810
01:03:34,542 --> 01:03:36,208
{\an8}<i>Some days we have no money.</i>

811
01:03:38,083 --> 01:03:40,333
{\an8}<i>Like right now we don't even have a nickel.</i>

812
01:03:41,125 --> 01:03:42,917
{\an8}<i>It's good we came today.</i>

813
01:03:42,958 --> 01:03:43,833
{\an8}<i>Yes.</i>

814
01:03:46,417 --> 01:03:50,292
{\an8}<i>Mom, here a candle,</i>
<i>since you don't have electricity.</i>

815
01:03:53,542 --> 01:03:56,458
{\an8}<i>And here is a picture of me and Biu.</i>

816
01:03:58,583 --> 01:04:02,833
{\an8}<i>Mom, here is some shampoo</i>
<i>so you can wash your hair.</i>

817
01:04:03,042 --> 01:04:04,417
{\an8}<i>Wow, a lot.</i>

818
01:04:16,292 --> 01:04:17,875
{\an8}<i>Does Dad smoke?</i>

819
01:04:18,292 --> 01:04:21,583
{\an8}<i>Tell him I really want him to quit.</i>

820
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:25,958
{\an8}<i>Remember me, study hard, be good, okay?</i>

821
01:04:26,167 --> 01:04:29,417
{\an8}<i>Study hard and finish school,</i>
<i>so you can get good jobs.</i>

822
01:04:29,583 --> 01:04:32,125
{\an8}<i>So your lives will be better than ours. Understand?</i>

823
01:04:32,833 --> 01:04:34,208
{\an8}<i>Study hard.</i>

824
01:04:36,167 --> 01:04:38,083
{\an8}<i>Kiss Dad, he's going to miss you.</i>

825
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:43,542
{\an8}<i>- Dad, you shouldn't drink.</i>
<i>- Huh?</i>

826
01:04:43,542 --> 01:04:46,042
{\an8}<i>Please don't drink. It can give you cancer.</i>

827
01:04:46,542 --> 01:04:49,833
{\an8}<i>You can get black lung and die.</i>

828
01:04:51,875 --> 01:04:56,000
{\an8}<i>Dad, stay safe, okay?</i>

829
01:04:56,750 --> 01:04:58,625
{\an8}<i>Why do you smoke?</i>

830
01:04:58,792 --> 01:05:00,000
{\an8}<i>Smoked a long time.</i>

831
01:05:00,125 --> 01:05:01,250
{\an8}<i>You can't stop?</i>

832
01:05:01,667 --> 01:05:02,833
{\an8}<i>No.</i>

833
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:18,833
{\an8}<i>Dad, can I have a hug?</i>

834
01:05:22,292 --> 01:05:24,542
{\an8}<i>Work hard.</i>

835
01:05:25,583 --> 01:05:28,083
{\an8}<i>I'll come see you. Sleep over too.</i>

836
01:05:28,417 --> 01:05:30,000
{\an8}<i>On our holiday.</i>

837
01:05:30,167 --> 01:05:32,750
{\an8}<i>Just two more months.</i>

838
01:05:34,458 --> 01:05:36,417
{\an8}<i>I'll call you often.</i>

839
01:05:48,333 --> 01:05:49,917
{\an8}<i>How do they feed you?</i>

840
01:05:49,917 --> 01:05:54,833
{\an8}<i>Someone makes it for us in the school kitchen,</i>

841
01:05:54,875 --> 01:05:57,958
{\an8}<i>but in the mornings we make it ourselves.</i>
<i>Sometimes visitors donate lunch</i>

842
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,750
{\an8}<i>and we make our own dinner.</i>

843
01:06:38,333 --> 01:06:46,500
{\an8}<i>If you don't study hard your life will be like</i>
<i>your parents but you are doing well. You study hard.</i>

844
01:06:46,542 --> 01:06:48,083
{\an8}<i>I'm going to save money for mom.</i>

845
01:06:48,167 --> 01:06:51,667
{\an8}<i>Oh you are? That's very good.</i>

846
01:06:52,292 --> 01:06:54,417
{\an8}<i>I'm going to have to give you a kiss now.</i>

847
01:09:42,833 --> 01:09:44,958
{\an8}<i>It's Mother Aew.</i>

848
01:09:50,875 --> 01:09:53,125
{\an8}<i>Mother Priew</i>

849
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:55,833
{\an8}<i>Spaghetti straps!</i>

850
01:10:03,583 --> 01:10:05,708
{\an8}<i>That's Mee Chai.</i>

851
01:10:05,917 --> 01:10:06,875
{\an8}<i>Hey!</i>

852
01:10:09,917 --> 01:10:11,000
{\an8}<i>I'll get you!</i>

853
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:20,125
{\an8}<i>The floor is open, hands up.</i>

854
01:10:22,042 --> 01:10:25,875
{\an8}<i>Who wants to speak, go ahead and start.</i>

855
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:37,708
{\an8}<i>Mom, I wish you the best in health. I love you,</i>
<i>even though I may not call often enough.</i>

856
01:10:37,917 --> 01:10:41,958
{\an8}<i>If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be here today.</i>

857
01:10:42,542 --> 01:10:49,667
{\an8}<i>You've given me everything and</i>
<i>I will do my best with that.</i>

858
01:10:50,333 --> 01:10:51,250
{\an8}<i>Mom.</i>

859
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:54,667
{\an8}<i>Never mind.</i>

860
01:10:57,542 --> 01:10:58,417
{\an8}<i>I forgot.</i>

861
01:10:59,458 --> 01:11:00,333
{\an8}<i>Come on!</i>

862
01:11:01,667 --> 01:11:03,250
{\an8}<i>Let it out.</i>

863
01:11:04,542 --> 01:11:05,917
{\an8}<i>Stay calm.</i>

864
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:15,875
{\an8}<i>There's no mother, my own or anyone,</i>
<i>who can compare to you.</i>

865
01:11:16,458 --> 01:11:18,250
{\an8}<i>Thank you.</i>

866
01:11:25,833 --> 01:11:27,083
{\an8}<i>Go ahead.</i>

867
01:11:27,292 --> 01:11:32,167
{\an8}<i>Thank you, Mom.</i>
<i>For giving a life to a little boy.</i>

868
01:11:32,167 --> 01:11:37,042
{\an8}<i>A chance at success.</i>
<i>For looking after everything.</i>

869
01:11:37,958 --> 01:11:46,667
{\an8}<i>For giving me opportunities</i>
<i>I never would have had.</i>

870
01:11:48,833 --> 01:11:49,833
{\an8}<i>Never.</i>

871
01:11:51,667 --> 01:11:53,500
{\an8}<i>For giving me a good life.</i>

872
01:11:53,875 --> 01:11:58,542
{\an8}<i>Wherever I go, I am always thinking of you</i>

873
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,833
{\an8}<i>and the other mothers, Mother Nee, everyone.</i>

874
01:12:05,542 --> 01:12:11,208
{\an8}<i>I see you wake up at 3 or 4 in</i>
<i>the morning to work hard every day.</i>

875
01:12:12,875 --> 01:12:21,792
{\an8}<i>You've raised all these alumni up until</i>
<i>my generation, but you never tire.</i>

876
01:12:23,917 --> 01:12:33,750
{\an8}<i>I think that you're tired but you never show</i>
<i>it. I've never seen you falter, or cry.</i>

877
01:12:36,208 --> 01:12:41,833
{\an8}<i>Well, I feel like you are Children's Village,</i>
<i>and Children's Village is you.</i>

878
01:12:41,875 --> 01:12:47,833
{\an8}<i>Children's Village gives children</i>
<i>from broken homes the chance</i>

879
01:12:47,917 --> 01:12:53,083
{\an8}<i>to grow up and</i>
<i>feel like a part of society.</i>

880
01:12:53,208 --> 01:13:01,625
{\an8}<i>It gave us a chance to build better families of</i>
<i>our own, so I want to tell you</i>

881
01:13:01,667 --> 01:13:06,167
{\an8}<i>that this boy will grow up</i>
<i>a part of your legacy.</i>

882
01:13:07,667 --> 01:13:12,917
{\an8}<i>He will grow from a boy</i>
<i>to a complete man. Thank Mom.</i>

883
01:13:13,167 --> 01:13:14,208
{\an8}<i>Thank you.</i>

884
01:13:27,292 --> 01:13:29,792
{\an8}<i>This is my first time back.</i>

885
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:35,625
{\an8}<i>I wish you were my real mother.</i>

886
01:13:35,625 --> 01:13:39,625
{\an8}<i>Oh, I'll always think of you as my daughter.</i>

887
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,292
{\an8}<i>It's been many years.</i>

888
01:13:43,333 --> 01:13:47,167
{\an8}<i>I felt like I was coming home when I arrived.</i>

889
01:13:47,375 --> 01:13:49,042
{\an8}<i>This is your home.</i>

890
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:59,875
{\an8}<i>I want to tell you,</i>

891
01:14:00,083 --> 01:14:03,333
{\an8}<i>I gave you all opportunities</i>

892
01:14:03,375 --> 01:14:09,542
{\an8}<i>because I believe in the good</i>
<i>and beauty within you.</i>

893
01:14:09,583 --> 01:14:22,375
{\an8}<i>I want you to use my belief to raise</i>
<i>your own children. Believe in their goodness.</i>

894
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:34,292
{\an8}<i>I request that you stand tall on strong legs</i>
<i>and a caring heart to try</i>

895
01:14:34,458 --> 01:14:44,542
{\an8}<i>and bridge the gaps in society.</i>
<i>The gaps between the poor and wealthy.</i>

896
01:14:44,708 --> 01:14:55,667
{\an8}<i>I wish you all success, because let's face</i>
<i>it, I won't be alive much longer.</i>

897
01:14:55,958 --> 01:15:10,208
{\an8}<i>So, I must pass my work to you, my children,</i>
<i>to carry on with steady hearts and intelligent minds.</i>

898
01:15:11,375 --> 01:15:16,375
{\an8}<i>Yes, use your hands to rebuild society.</i>

899
01:16:44,917 --> 01:16:49,208
{\an8}<i>"Mom loves us. Mom takes care of us,</i>
<i>Mom holds us when we are lonely."</i>

900
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:52,750
{\an8}<i>"Mom's hugs are warmer than any blanket."</i>

901
01:17:31,417 --> 01:17:36,833
{\an8}<i>As a kid, I grew up in</i>
<i>an environment that, despite being in Bangkok</i>

902
01:17:36,917 --> 01:17:41,583
{\an8}<i>was in the rural outskirts of the city.</i>

903
01:17:41,625 --> 01:17:47,458
{\an8}<i>My family was a poor one,</i>
<i>but we never felt as though we were poor.</i>

904
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:53,125
{\an8}<i>I say we didn't feel poor because despite my</i>
<i>father's low income, we had plenty to eat.</i>

905
01:17:53,292 --> 01:18:00,375
{\an8}<i>We had shrimp and fish, and vegetables</i>
<i>grew in the river and from the ground</i>

906
01:18:00,417 --> 01:18:07,792
{\an8}<i>so as a child I felt like</i>
<i>I lived in complete natural environment.</i>

907
01:18:17,958 --> 01:18:21,875
{\an8}<i>Adults saw me as naughty.</i>

908
01:18:21,875 --> 01:18:31,417
{\an8}<i>If I didn't agree with something I was taught</i>
<i>or felt a different way, I was naughty.</i>

909
01:18:31,458 --> 01:18:37,625
{\an8}<i>For example, in my generation</i>
<i>they taught girls to be proper</i>

910
01:18:37,625 --> 01:18:42,125
{\an8}<i>and subservient to men. But I disagreed.</i>

911
01:18:42,708 --> 01:18:45,000
{\an8}<i>I thought we should be equal.</i>

912
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,958
{\an8}<i>It caused a lot of arguments with my mother.</i>

913
01:18:56,375 --> 01:19:03,250
{\an8}<i>I also put a lot of time and effort</i>
<i>into learning to cook,</i>

914
01:19:03,292 --> 01:19:10,750
{\an8}<i>and learning skills from my mother, the</i>
<i>things that she used to build our family</i>

915
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:18,333
{\an8}<i>the things that kept my parent's</i>
<i>love strong all the way until death.</i>

916
01:19:18,458 --> 01:19:23,667
{\an8}<i>I used those skills to cover up</i>
<i>a lot of my more boyish behavior.</i>

917
01:19:48,292 --> 01:19:55,750
{\an8}<i>In this next segment we present to you the stage play</i>
<i>The Birth of Children's Village.</i>

918
01:19:58,750 --> 01:20:01,750
{\an8}<i>Scene 1: Falling in Love.</i>

919
01:20:01,792 --> 01:20:06,042
{\an8}<i>The Royal Chaopraya University of Bangkok.</i>

920
01:20:12,042 --> 01:20:22,750
{\an8}<i>A young and idealistic young man</i>
<i>becomes the object of love for a young lady.</i>

921
01:20:27,292 --> 01:20:33,833
{\an8}<i>The fair Aew was hoping to catch the attention</i>
<i>and affections of young Pibhop Dhongchai.</i>

922
01:20:33,875 --> 01:20:37,958
{\an8}<i>Or who we affectionately know as Piak.</i>

923
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,083
{\an8}<i>Fight the power!</i>

924
01:20:39,125 --> 01:20:39,875
{\an8}<i>Fight!</i>

925
01:20:39,917 --> 01:20:41,000
{\an8}<i>Fight the power!</i>

926
01:20:41,042 --> 01:20:42,083
{\an8}<i>Fight!</i>

927
01:20:43,167 --> 01:20:44,125
{\an8}<i>Fight the power!</i>

928
01:20:44,167 --> 01:20:45,375
{\an8}<i>Fight!</i>

929
01:20:45,833 --> 01:20:49,000
{\an8}<i>After seeing him, Aew immediately thought...</i>

930
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:52,500
{\an8}<i>Wow, this guy is exactly my type.</i>

931
01:20:56,333 --> 01:20:57,708
{\an8}<i>Is that true, Mom?</i>

932
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:59,458
{\an8}<i>You have to find a way.</i>

933
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:05,417
{\an8}<i>He’s so dreamy. I’m waiting for</i>
<i>the day when he talks to me.</i>

934
01:21:07,167 --> 01:21:10,958
{\an8}<i>Well, now’s your chance.</i>
<i>Ask to take a picture with him when he’s done.</i>

935
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,250
{\an8}<i>Okay, I’ll go now.</i>

936
01:21:39,583 --> 01:21:44,792
{\an8}<i>Now husband and wife,</i>
<i>the couple built the first Summerhill school in Thailand.</i>

937
01:21:44,958 --> 01:21:51,292
{\an8}<i>They opened this school to give poor children</i>
<i>the chance at an education</i>

938
01:21:51,625 --> 01:21:55,042
{\an8}<i>and also to live in happiness.</i>

939
01:21:57,375 --> 01:22:06,167
{\an8}<i>Children's Village is important to Thailand</i>
<i>because 35 years ago</i>

940
01:22:06,375 --> 01:22:13,000
{\an8}<i>there was no alternative</i>
<i>to the public school system.</i>

941
01:22:13,125 --> 01:22:16,875
{\an8}<i>Children's Village was the first and only alternative.</i>

942
01:22:17,208 --> 01:22:18,833
{\an8}<i>Scene : 3</i>

943
01:22:19,083 --> 01:22:20,667
{\an8}<i>The Present...</i>

944
01:22:22,583 --> 01:22:26,875
{\an8}<i>Be careful, Mom,</i>
<i>your knees aren’t doing so well anymore.</i>

945
01:22:27,083 --> 01:22:30,917
{\an8}<i>Mother Aew is thinking those clothes look so familiar.</i>

946
01:22:30,958 --> 01:22:32,833
{\an8}<i>Yes, and her posture?</i>

947
01:22:36,667 --> 01:22:43,542
{\an8}<i>Piak, I think I will close our school, I haven’t</i>
<i>been able to find someone to take over for me.</i>

948
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:50,708
{\an8}<i>I’ve been looking for a long time</i>
<i>and I have so many problems to face.</i>

949
01:22:51,375 --> 01:22:57,917
{\an8}<i>There are always people asking me for help</i>
<i>or my time, I’m at the end of my rope.</i>

950
01:22:58,292 --> 01:23:01,917
{\an8}<i>Look at it from another angle, Aew,</i>
<i>don’t see these things as problems.</i>

951
01:23:02,083 --> 01:23:03,875
{\an8}<i>If we are stuck, we will help each other.</i>

952
01:23:03,917 --> 01:23:10,667
{\an8}<i>I admit I stated often that we'd find</i>
<i>a new leader for Children's Village.</i>

953
01:23:10,958 --> 01:23:19,500
{\an8}<i>But I didn't mean I was quitting,</i>
<i>but stepping aside for new people to lead.</i>

954
01:23:27,875 --> 01:23:36,375
{\an8}<i>I think the teachers and</i>
<i>staff putting on that</i>

955
01:23:36,417 --> 01:23:40,375
{\an8}<i>play about me is hilarious.</i>

956
01:23:40,708 --> 01:23:46,625
{\an8}<i>If our school is run in a truly democratic manner</i>

957
01:23:46,833 --> 01:23:50,542
{\an8}<i>the staff should be able to</i>
<i>make fun of their superiors freely.</i>

958
01:23:50,708 --> 01:23:55,667
{\an8}<i>It makes me proud to see</i>
<i>we are democratic here.</i>

959
01:23:59,208 --> 01:24:04,667
{\an8}<i>Mom was my first friend, the first person to</i>
<i>look after me, the first person to speak with me</i>

960
01:24:04,708 --> 01:24:10,333
{\an8}<i>the first person to hug me, the first person</i>
<i>to teach me the ways of the world.</i>

961
01:24:10,583 --> 01:24:19,958
{\an8}<i>My mom is the one that taught me</i>
<i>compassion and my approach to life</i>

962
01:24:20,083 --> 01:24:24,042
{\an8}<i>I always get goose bumps speaking about</i>
<i>her because I loved her so much.</i>

963
01:24:24,625 --> 01:24:32,958
{\an8}<i>It may be impossible to name all of Mom’s good</i>
<i>qualities, but one certainty is I would not have</i>

964
01:24:33,167 --> 01:24:38,375
{\an8}<i>a chance at life or success</i>
<i>if it wasn’t for Mom and Children's Village.</i>

965
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:50,375
{\an8}<i>I feel that my relationship with</i>
<i>my mother goes beyond mother-daughter love.</i>

966
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:58,042
{\an8}<i>My mother was a good teacher,</i>
<i>and I think every mother should be.</i>

967
01:25:05,375 --> 01:25:09,792
{\an8}<i>My mother was very upset with me</i>
<i>for walking away from a more stable life.</i>

968
01:25:09,833 --> 01:25:11,833
{\an8}<i>She wouldn't speak with me.</i>

969
01:25:11,875 --> 01:25:19,583
{\an8}<i>When I first opened the school,</i>
<i>she didn't understand. It was such a new concept.</i>

970
01:25:19,625 --> 01:25:25,458
{\an8}<i>She didn't see why I left the public school system,</i>
<i>which was secure and safe</i>

971
01:25:25,708 --> 01:25:32,333
{\an8}<i>in exchange for much harder</i>
<i>living conditions in the jungle.</i>

972
01:25:32,542 --> 01:25:41,417
{\an8}<i>So, after three years I went to visit, and</i>
<i>because I couldn't put my reasons into words</i>

973
01:25:41,542 --> 01:25:48,500
{\an8}<i>I took some of the children with me</i>
<i>and told my mother their stories</i>

974
01:25:48,833 --> 01:25:53,167
{\an8}<i>about their hardships and</i>
<i>my mother understood and supported me.</i>

975
01:25:56,750 --> 01:26:01,625
{\an8}<i>If you are listening think of me.</i>

976
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:07,750
{\an8}<i>I promise I will be a good child.</i>

977
01:26:12,208 --> 01:26:18,833
{\an8}<i>If there is someone who worries all the time</i>

978
01:26:19,792 --> 01:26:25,792
{\an8}<i>Who gives up her time and energy selflessly.</i>

979
01:26:26,333 --> 01:26:33,375
{\an8}<i>If there is someone who keeps her pain to herself</i>

980
01:26:33,417 --> 01:26:38,333
{\an8}<i>Thinking more about us than herself.</i>

981
01:26:39,708 --> 01:26:43,500
{\an8}<i>If there is someone...</i>

982
01:26:43,542 --> 01:26:51,167
{\an8}<i>Mother's Day is a reminder of the huge</i>
<i>influence a mother has on her children.</i>

983
01:26:51,583 --> 01:26:56,917
{\an8}<i>A mother is both a parent and a teacher</i>

984
01:26:56,958 --> 01:27:01,667
{\an8}<i>someone of great value to a child.</i>

985
01:27:01,708 --> 01:27:04,917
{\an8}<i>No matter how old you are,</i>

986
01:27:04,958 --> 01:27:12,458
{\an8}<i>when you encounter hardship,</i>
<i>you think of your mother.</i>

987
01:27:12,833 --> 01:27:17,750
{\an8}<i>She is the only one who always forgives me.</i>

988
01:27:17,958 --> 01:27:21,708
{\an8}<i>No matter how many faults</i>

989
01:27:21,875 --> 01:27:25,208
{\an8}<i>that make me a naughty child</i>

990
01:27:25,250 --> 01:27:30,250
{\an8}<i>I know her love will never change.</i>

991
01:27:31,792 --> 01:27:35,958
{\an8}<i>I want to thank you</i>

992
01:27:36,583 --> 01:27:37,625
{\an8}<i>What?</i>

993
01:27:38,917 --> 01:27:50,083
{\an8}<i>My mother had cancer and</i>
<i>I spent her last two months with her and</i>

994
01:27:51,083 --> 01:28:00,583
{\an8}<i>my brother informed me her lungs stopped working</i>
<i>and she would pass within two days.</i>

995
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:07,333
{\an8}<i>I ran back to Children's Village because</i>
<i>I couldn't bear seeing her die in front of me.</i>

996
01:28:07,417 --> 01:28:13,250
{\an8}<i>I asked my older sister to be</i>
<i>the one to stay and ran back here.</i>

997
01:28:13,292 --> 01:28:21,125
{\an8}<i>So, it may seem that I am a bad person for that,</i>
<i>but I really couldn't bear it</i>

998
01:28:21,708 --> 01:28:23,750
{\an8}<i>because I love her so much.</i>

999
01:28:38,417 --> 01:28:40,250
{\an8}<i>What's wrong?</i>

1000
01:28:41,625 --> 01:28:45,750
{\an8}<i>"I want to thank you". Sing it.</i>

1001
01:28:45,917 --> 01:28:52,833
{\an8}<i>I want to thank you for being my mother</i>

1002
01:28:52,875 --> 01:28:59,000
{\an8}<i>giving me love without exception,</i>
<i>a love like no other.</i>

1003
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:05,792
{\an8}<i>I will always have you throughout my life.</i>

1004
01:29:05,833 --> 01:29:12,125
{\an8}<i>So I have four little words</i>
<i>to say from my heart.</i>

1005
01:29:12,417 --> 01:29:15,375
{\an8}<i>I love you Mom.</i>

1006
01:29:30,458 --> 01:29:39,500
{\an8}<i>My plan is to build the teachers</i>
<i>and students into the school's new leaders</i>

1007
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:43,250
{\an8}<i>and I hope I can hand the school off to them one day.</i>

1008
01:29:47,583 --> 01:29:52,458
{\an8}<i>I believe that when I'm gone</i>
<i>and someone takes my place here</i>

1009
01:29:52,583 --> 01:29:59,958
{\an8}<i>they may have their personal ideas</i>
<i>and should run the school according to them.</i>

1010
01:30:00,083 --> 01:30:03,750
{\an8}<i>I think change is fine as long as</i>
<i>the goal is the student's happiness.</i>

1011
01:30:03,875 --> 01:30:06,750
{\an8}<i>Maybe they will even implement a new system.</i>

1012
01:30:16,333 --> 01:30:19,792
{\an8}<i>Thailand is a land of mothers.</i>

1013
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:28,500
{\an8}<i>because in Thai the word "Mother"</i>
<i>is used in the terms for river, the earth,</i>

1014
01:30:28,625 --> 01:30:35,375
{\an8}<i>rice, and so many</i>
<i>other things in nature are called Mother.</i>

1015
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:42,625
{\an8}<i>The meaning behind that is</i>
<i>mothers give their children love and warmth</i>

1016
01:30:42,667 --> 01:30:47,958
{\an8}<i>and if you come to Thailand</i>
<i>you'll feel that warmth given to you.</i>

1017
01:30:55,958 --> 01:31:02,042
{\an8}<i>If I look back at my life, from</i>
<i>childhood to now, it's been a happy one.</i>

1018
01:31:02,167 --> 01:31:10,792
{\an8}<i>I was happy with my family as a child,</i>
<i>then I married and became a mother.</i>

1019
01:31:10,833 --> 01:31:18,500
{\an8}<i>I am also proud to be the mother of</i>
<i>300 or 400 students at Children's Village.</i>

1020
01:31:18,750 --> 01:31:20,583
{\an8}<i>I have been fortunate...</i>

1021
01:31:20,875 --> 01:31:27,250
{\an8}<i>...to be among people</i>
<i>I love and who love me.</i>

1022
01:31:27,625 --> 01:31:31,833
{\an8}<i>I feel fortunate to have lived my life.</i>
