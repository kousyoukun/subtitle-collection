1
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,300
Hold on, I gotta come up!

2
00:02:50,367 --> 00:02:52,432
I've gotta take
the world's biggest fucking piss.

3
00:02:52,499 --> 00:02:54,366
We can't be late!

4
00:02:54,432 --> 00:02:55,967
We won't!

5
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:19,832
Who's... who's holding?

6
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,433
If you 're not, then nobody.

7
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,299
We were kind of hoping you were.

8
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:25,699
- Yeah. How are you not holding?
- Jesus Christ, Shanna.

9
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:28,632
It is not my fucking job to supply y'all
with weed when we go out.

10
00:03:28,899 --> 00:03:30,899
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, little lady.

11
00:03:30,966 --> 00:03:32,899
You 're gettin' angry kind of quick,
don't you think?

12
00:03:32,966 --> 00:03:34,099
I was just teasin' you!

13
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,500
I'm not angry.
It just would be nice

14
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,232
if y'all didn't just count on me
all the fucking time

15
00:03:38,232 --> 00:03:41,032
and surprise me
every once in a while with pot.

16
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:42,966
Okay, mean girl
in a high school movie.

17
00:03:43,032 --> 00:03:44,299
Are you through
having a tantrum?

18
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:45,500
I'm not having a tantrum.

19
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:47,767
Yes, you are. You 've been
in the car all of two seconds,

20
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,966
and you 're already cursing at me.

21
00:03:49,032 --> 00:03:50,699
I am not cursing at you.

22
00:03:50,766 --> 00:03:54,698
You said "Jesus Christ, Shanna,"

23
00:03:54,765 --> 00:03:56,231
and then before
the sentence was over

24
00:03:56,298 --> 00:03:59,099
<i>you threw a "fucking" in there
to emphasize your irritatedness.</i>

25
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,299
Come on, don't fight.
I'll pay for it when we get some.

26
00:04:01,432 --> 00:04:05,231
One, it is not about the money.
It is about the pain in the ass of scoring.

27
00:04:05,298 --> 00:04:07,499
And two, we're not really fighting.

28
00:04:07,499 --> 00:04:11,099
Arlene, you 've forgotten what
hanging out with Jungle Julia is like.

29
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:12,299
That wasn't a fight.

30
00:04:12,366 --> 00:04:14,766
That was Julia
acting like a grumpy bitch

31
00:04:14,832 --> 00:04:18,499
and me calling her on it
and indulging her at the same time.

32
00:04:18,499 --> 00:04:21,498
That's how we tolerate each other
after all these years.

33
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:22,499
Oh! Billboard!

34
00:04:26,765 --> 00:04:28,565
So, what's the plan, man?

35
00:04:28,631 --> 00:04:30,565
Margaritas and Mexican food at Guero's.

36
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:32,431
Did you call Rafael
and tell him we're coming?

37
00:04:32,498 --> 00:04:33,831
- Of course.
- You 're so good.

38
00:04:33,965 --> 00:04:35,032
I know.

39
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,431
Okay, is Christian Simonson
gonna be there?

40
00:04:37,565 --> 00:04:40,099
You bet your ass he is...
with Jesse Letterman.

41
00:04:40,232 --> 00:04:43,031
Christian Simonson,
the filmmaker, is in town.

42
00:04:43,298 --> 00:04:44,498
He's got a big thing for Julia.

43
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:46,898
If he had a big thing for me,
he'd fucking call me,

44
00:04:46,898 --> 00:04:48,499
as opposed to disappearing
for six months,

45
00:04:48,499 --> 00:04:50,632
and he'd get his ass down here
more often than he does.

46
00:04:50,898 --> 00:04:53,365
And on my birthday
he'd give me a fucking phone call.

47
00:04:53,431 --> 00:04:54,565
Oh, billboard!

48
00:05:01,765 --> 00:05:04,298
Yeah, but you get
those legs of yours around him,

49
00:05:04,365 --> 00:05:05,498
and it's all over.

50
00:05:05,498 --> 00:05:08,964
Yeah, well, when I'm redecorating
his house in the hills that I am also living in,

51
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,431
I'll let you know it worked.

52
00:05:10,431 --> 00:05:12,965
So, margaritas
and Mexican food at Guero's,

53
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:14,831
touch base with Chris and Jesse,
tell them about later,

54
00:05:14,965 --> 00:05:16,965
and make damn sure they come.

55
00:05:17,031 --> 00:05:20,031
Those other guys'll be waiting for us
at the Texas Chili Parlor.

56
00:05:20,098 --> 00:05:23,497
Oh, shit. Speaking of which...

57
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:25,231
what happened
with you and Nate last night?

58
00:05:25,298 --> 00:05:27,897
Well, you know, not much.
We just fucking met each other.

59
00:05:27,964 --> 00:05:30,697
If you don't bust their balls a little bit,
they're never gonna respect you.

60
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:32,897
<i>Okay, we're pretty clear
on what it is you didn 't do.</i>

61
00:05:33,097 --> 00:05:35,230
<i>How about enlightening us
on what it is you did do?</i>

62
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,231
Oh, nothing to write home about.

63
00:05:37,231 --> 00:05:39,564
We just made out on the couch
for about 20 minutes.

64
00:05:39,697 --> 00:05:41,098
Dressed, half-dressed, or naked?

65
00:05:41,165 --> 00:05:43,764
Dressed. I said we made out.
We didn't do "the thing."

66
00:05:43,897 --> 00:05:47,030
Oh, excuse me for living,
but what is "the thing"?

67
00:05:47,164 --> 00:05:48,897
You know, it's everything but.

68
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,631
They call that "the thing"?

69
00:05:50,765 --> 00:05:52,231
I call it "the thing."

70
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:54,164
Do guys like "the thing"?

71
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,830
They like it better than "no thing."

72
00:05:57,697 --> 00:06:00,029
<i>Okay, I wanna get back
to what it is you did do.</i>

73
00:06:00,096 --> 00:06:01,496
So you 're making out
on the couch with Nate, right?

74
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:02,497
Correct.

75
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,097
Whose couch?
His or the one in your hotel room?

76
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,497
What am I, stupid over here? Mine.

77
00:06:06,497 --> 00:06:08,497
Were you making out
sitting up or lying down?

78
00:06:08,564 --> 00:06:10,896
We started sitting up,
we worked our way to lying down.

79
00:06:10,963 --> 00:06:13,897
Hmm. The plot thickens.
Who was on top?

80
00:06:13,897 --> 00:06:15,764
I was straddling him.

81
00:06:16,564 --> 00:06:17,430
What else?

82
00:06:17,497 --> 00:06:20,297
That was it. So we made out
for a little while on the couch...

83
00:06:20,497 --> 00:06:25,096
and I said, "Okay, I'm gonna go to bed now,
so it's time for you to leave."

84
00:06:25,096 --> 00:06:27,764
And then he starts to whine,
"Oh, right now?"

85
00:06:27,897 --> 00:06:30,829
And I said,
"Yup, right now. Let's go."

86
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:33,363
And he says, "Wait, what about this?"
And I said no.

87
00:06:33,429 --> 00:06:35,229
He said, "What do you mean?
You don't know what I'm gonna say."

88
00:06:35,363 --> 00:06:38,296
I said, "I already know what you 're
gonna say, and the answer's no."

89
00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:40,029
He said, "Well, how can you say
you know what I'm gonna say?"

90
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:42,496
And I said, "Because you 're gonna say,
'Let's just go to sleep together.

91
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,897
'We don't gotta do nothing.

92
00:06:43,897 --> 00:06:45,896
'Just cuddle,
sleep next to each other,

93
00:06:45,963 --> 00:06:47,696
wake up in the morning together."'

94
00:06:47,896 --> 00:06:51,096
"No. You 're gonna leave...
but I'll see you tomorrow."

95
00:06:51,096 --> 00:06:52,364
Yeah, fuck Nate.

96
00:06:52,364 --> 00:06:53,297
I mean, he's cute and all,

97
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:56,296
but Jesse Letterman
is gonna be all over her.

98
00:06:56,363 --> 00:06:59,563
Remember...
no hookin' up tonight.

99
00:06:59,563 --> 00:07:02,962
You can hang out with them,
you can make out with them,

100
00:07:03,095 --> 00:07:04,963
but no hookin' up with them,

101
00:07:05,096 --> 00:07:08,229
because we are driving
to Lake L.B.J. tonight,

102
00:07:08,363 --> 00:07:10,229
and my daddy's pretty clear
about one thing...

103
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:15,163
He said, "I am lettin' you
and your girlfriends stay at my lake house,

104
00:07:15,296 --> 00:07:19,229
not you and a bunch of horny boys
trying to get their fuck on with my daughter."

105
00:07:19,296 --> 00:07:21,429
- Your dad talks like that?
- Hell yeah.

106
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:23,696
And it's not like
he ain't gonna know, either,

107
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:27,295
because when I'm staying at the lake house
with my girlfriends in our bikinis,

108
00:07:27,362 --> 00:07:31,296
Daddy just has a tendency to pop up
and make sure we don't need anything.

109
00:07:32,628 --> 00:07:36,162
Look, he's totally harmless
and cute as a bug's ear!

110
00:07:36,228 --> 00:07:38,695
But you know, when he's got
a bunch of half-naked poontang

111
00:07:38,895 --> 00:07:41,095
walking the floor of his lake house,

112
00:07:41,095 --> 00:07:44,362
he just likes to pay us a visit
and make sure we got everything we need.

113
00:07:44,495 --> 00:07:45,896
And if you flirt shamelessly with him,

114
00:07:45,963 --> 00:07:48,428
like the six-foot baby giraffe
in the backseat,

115
00:07:48,562 --> 00:07:50,428
you got a puppy dog for life.

116
00:07:50,562 --> 00:07:52,028
I have my own relationship with Ben,

117
00:07:52,162 --> 00:07:53,962
and you 're just jealous
'cause it don't include you.

118
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:55,229
You call her dad "Ben"?

119
00:07:55,363 --> 00:07:57,563
I'm not a child.
That's his name.

120
00:07:57,629 --> 00:07:59,495
So, when are the boys
showing up?

121
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,628
They're gonna meet us
at the Chili Parlor.

122
00:08:01,695 --> 00:08:03,227
Maybe they can bring some pot.

123
00:08:03,227 --> 00:08:04,694
Fuck that. No.

124
00:08:04,694 --> 00:08:06,895
I don't wanna be either A,
depending on their fucking ass,

125
00:08:07,095 --> 00:08:08,362
or B, depending on their ass.

126
00:08:08,428 --> 00:08:09,628
Uh-uh. If we don't score ourselves,

127
00:08:09,695 --> 00:08:12,295
we're gonna be stuck with them
all fucking night.

128
00:08:12,362 --> 00:08:14,361
Ooh! Try Lanna-Frank.

129
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,027
Best idea you had all day.

130
00:08:16,094 --> 00:08:19,094
Oh, hey! That's your
last billboard before Guero's!

131
00:08:19,094 --> 00:08:20,895
Oh, come on, give me a break.

132
00:08:21,095 --> 00:08:23,562
Oh, come on, my ass!
We said every time.

133
00:08:23,695 --> 00:08:24,695
Okay.

134
00:08:31,294 --> 00:08:33,562
##

135
00:08:38,627 --> 00:08:40,227
Jules, let me get a drag.

136
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:41,427
Thanks.

137
00:09:11,094 --> 00:09:11,961
Oh, my God.

138
00:09:12,361 --> 00:09:15,094
Hey, this is...
and I's U.T. days, Arlene.

139
00:09:15,227 --> 00:09:16,160
Hey.

140
00:09:16,226 --> 00:09:18,694
- You wanna join us?
- For a second, but I'm with some friends.

141
00:09:19,294 --> 00:09:20,694
Ooh...

142
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:22,827
So, you must be... must be...

143
00:09:22,827 --> 00:09:25,561
So, you must be
the infamous Butterfly.

144
00:09:25,627 --> 00:09:26,827
Shh!

145
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:28,694
She don't know nothing about it.

146
00:09:28,761 --> 00:09:30,494
- Know about what?
- When were y'all gonna tell her?

147
00:09:30,694 --> 00:09:31,626
<i>- Soon.
- Tell me what?</i>

148
00:09:31,693 --> 00:09:34,361
Yeah, now thanks to you,
we've gotta tell her sooner than later.

149
00:09:34,427 --> 00:09:35,961
All right, cut the shit.
What the fuck is going on?

150
00:09:36,027 --> 00:09:38,493
I said a little something-something
about you on the air today.

151
00:09:38,493 --> 00:09:40,760
Julia, what the fuck
did you say about me on the radio?

152
00:09:40,826 --> 00:09:44,093
All I said was I had
a sexy friend named Butterfly

153
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,093
who was in from out-of-town
for the weekend,

154
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,626
and we would be going out
somewhere in Austin tonight,

155
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,027
and if they were out on the town,
maybe they'd see us.

156
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:55,560
And I described you, and I said
that if they spotted you while we were out,

157
00:09:55,626 --> 00:09:58,493
if they'd do something,
you 'd do something.

158
00:09:58,493 --> 00:09:59,761
Okay, now, Julia, I'm serious.

159
00:09:59,827 --> 00:10:02,094
What did you say
and what did you say I'd do?

160
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:06,093
Anywho, I could explain what I said,
which would be boring,

161
00:10:06,093 --> 00:10:08,625
or Marcy over here,

162
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:11,092
who is an incredible actress,
could act it out for you,

163
00:10:11,292 --> 00:10:15,093
which I think will give you a better idea
what you have in store for you tonight.

164
00:10:15,093 --> 00:10:17,093
Okay, so just tell me your way.

165
00:10:17,293 --> 00:10:19,092
- So we'll act it out with Marcy?
- Sure.

166
00:10:19,292 --> 00:10:21,360
Okay, give Marcy your drink.

167
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,893
Okay, so you 're
in a club or a bar,

168
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:28,826
and Marcy's a kind of cute
or kind of hot or kind of sexy

169
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,560
or better be
fucking hysterically funny,

170
00:10:30,693 --> 00:10:33,226
<i>but not-funny-looking guy
who you could fuck.</i>

171
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,559
Got it.

172
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,292
Okay, Marcy, take it.

173
00:10:44,692 --> 00:10:45,959
Howdy.

174
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:48,292
Hi, there.

175
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:50,825
Excuse me, but...

176
00:10:51,092 --> 00:10:52,893
your name wouldn't be
"Butterfly," would it?

177
00:10:52,893 --> 00:10:56,759
Yes, it is, and it seems
you have me at a disadvantage.

178
00:10:56,825 --> 00:10:58,092
Barry.

179
00:10:58,292 --> 00:10:59,892
Pleased to meet you, Barry.

180
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,292
<i>Y'all are gettin' me hot!</i>

181
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:02,493
Shh!

182
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:09,559
So is, uh...
"Butterfly" your real name?

183
00:11:09,692 --> 00:11:11,291
Yes, it is.

184
00:11:11,358 --> 00:11:13,224
And how'd you know
my name, Barry?

185
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,959
I listened to Jungle Julia's show
this mornin'.

186
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,159
Oh, you did, did you?

187
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:19,425
Oh, yeah, I listen to her show
every morning.

188
00:11:19,425 --> 00:11:21,424
Oh, you do, do you?

189
00:11:21,424 --> 00:11:24,492
Yeah, she's like
the coolest lady in town.

190
00:11:24,492 --> 00:11:26,892
Don't you think
she's got a big ass?

191
00:11:26,892 --> 00:11:30,159
Nah, man!
I like her ass that way.

192
00:11:30,225 --> 00:11:32,092
She got a black girl's ass.

193
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,759
Well, that's what she always says,

194
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:36,558
but in actual fact, she doesn't
really have a black girl's ass.

195
00:11:36,624 --> 00:11:38,558
<i>She's got a big ass.</i>

196
00:11:38,624 --> 00:11:39,892
Okay, what the fuck
are you doing?

197
00:11:40,092 --> 00:11:41,824
Look who wants
to get to the point all of a sudden.

198
00:11:41,891 --> 00:11:43,091
Okay, we'll get to the point,

199
00:11:43,091 --> 00:11:44,958
but for your information,
skinny bitch,

200
00:11:45,024 --> 00:11:47,958
black men and a whole lot
of motherfuckin' white men

201
00:11:48,024 --> 00:11:50,424
have had plenty of fun
adoring my ass.

202
00:11:50,558 --> 00:11:53,558
I don't wear their teeth marks
on my butt for nothing.

203
00:11:53,624 --> 00:11:55,959
If you 're not gonna buy me a drink,
can I have mine back?

204
00:11:56,025 --> 00:11:58,291
No, okay, okay, okay, okay.

205
00:11:58,358 --> 00:11:59,624
So, Butterfly...

206
00:11:59,691 --> 00:12:01,091
can I buy you a drink?

207
00:12:01,224 --> 00:12:02,424
I'd love one.

208
00:12:02,691 --> 00:12:03,491
What can I get ya?

209
00:12:03,558 --> 00:12:05,092
I'll take a margarita.

210
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:07,491
Here ya go.

211
00:12:08,691 --> 00:12:10,691
So, after they buy you a drink

212
00:12:10,691 --> 00:12:12,890
when they raise
their glass to toast,

213
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:17,691
they look you dead in the eye
and repeat this poem...

214
00:12:17,891 --> 00:12:22,091
"The woods are lovely,
dark and deep

215
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:27,024
And I have promises to keep
and miles to go before I sleep."

216
00:12:27,158 --> 00:12:28,891
Did you hear me, Butterfly?

217
00:12:29,024 --> 00:12:31,824
"Miles to go before you sleep."

218
00:12:31,824 --> 00:12:35,358
And then, if they say that...

219
00:12:36,624 --> 00:12:37,958
you gotta give 'em a lap dance.

220
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:39,623
What?

221
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,091
If they call you "Butterfly,"
buy you a drink, repeat that poem,

222
00:12:42,091 --> 00:12:43,024
you gotta give 'em a lap dance.

223
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:44,957
That's bullshit.
I ain't giving them nothin'.

224
00:12:45,023 --> 00:12:46,557
Well, you can do it or not,
but if you don't,

225
00:12:46,623 --> 00:12:48,890
everybody in Austin
is gonna think you a chicken shit.

226
00:12:48,957 --> 00:12:50,490
And I don't think you want
everybody in Austin

227
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,890
thinking you 're a chicken shit.

228
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,091
I ain't giving nobody no lap dance
'cause of what you said.

229
00:12:54,158 --> 00:12:56,090
Oh, come on!
It's gonna be funny!

230
00:12:56,157 --> 00:12:58,691
Yeah, everything's funny to you two
when it's happening to me.

231
00:12:58,891 --> 00:13:01,890
Look. You don't have to do it
for anybody you don't want.

232
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,890
I said you 'd do it
for the first guy who says it.

233
00:13:03,957 --> 00:13:06,824
So, some geek comes over
trying to be cool,

234
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,758
just tell him you already did it
at another place earlier.

235
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:13,357
No harm, no foul,
but you get a free drink out of it.

236
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,889
But maybe a little later
in the evening,

237
00:13:15,956 --> 00:13:17,489
you 've had a few drinks,

238
00:13:17,489 --> 00:13:19,623
you 're kind of loosey-goosey,

239
00:13:19,623 --> 00:13:21,423
you 're safe with your girls,

240
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:24,023
then some kind of cute,
kind of hot, kind of sexy,

241
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:27,889
hysterically funny, but not-funny-looking guy
comes up and says it...

242
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:31,890
then maybe you did it earlier,
maybe you didn't.

243
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,490
She's making me trip.

244
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:42,889
Shut the fuck up.
You made me trip, dumb bitch!

245
00:13:52,756 --> 00:13:54,489
You fuckin' idiot!

246
00:14:19,488 --> 00:14:22,156
##

247

Any dead soldiers here?

00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,221
Uh, these two. Thank you.

260
00:15:35,888 --> 00:15:37,421
Where the hell is Lanna-Frank?

261
00:15:37,488 --> 00:15:40,488
That's a good fucking question.

262
00:15:50,621 --> 00:15:51,887
Lanna-Frank!

263
00:15:52,554 --> 00:15:53,887
Where are you?

264
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:57,820
Well, come over already.
We're waiting for you.

265
00:15:57,887 --> 00:16:01,021
- ##
- Shit! Hold on!

266
00:16:12,687 --> 00:16:14,288
So, where are you?

267
00:16:15,288 --> 00:16:17,220
Come over already.
We're waiting for you.

268
00:16:18,287 --> 00:16:20,087
No. We're not coming over there.

269
00:16:20,287 --> 00:16:23,286
You come over here
like you said you would.

270
00:16:23,353 --> 00:16:26,220
So, is it Shauna and the girls
at the lake house this weekend?

271
00:16:26,354 --> 00:16:28,620
- Shauna?
- Oh, fuck. l...

272
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:29,687
No.

273
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,619
Now, there is one thing
that every girl in the whole world

274
00:16:32,619 --> 00:16:35,354
whose name is Shanna
has in common with each other.

275
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,954
We all hate the name "Shauna,"

276
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,354
and we really hate it
when people call us "Shauna."

277
00:17:15,086 --> 00:17:16,287
Just remember...

278
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,820
it's "Shanna Banana,"
not "Shauna Banauna."

279
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:22,019
Okay, but at some point in the evening,
I had fuckability stock.

280
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:25,218
Yeah, I mean, it wasn't bullish, but...

281
00:17:48,619 --> 00:17:50,885
##

282
00:17:50,885 --> 00:17:54,753
Okay... Warren's sending over shots,
and you know the house rules.

283
00:17:54,886 --> 00:17:57,418
If he sends over shots,
you gotta do them.

284
00:17:57,418 --> 00:17:59,752
- What?
- Hey, them's the rules, baby.

285
00:17:59,818 --> 00:18:03,285
- Warren says it, we do it!
I love that philosophy!

286
00:18:03,285 --> 00:18:05,686
"Warren says it, we do it."

287
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:07,685
So let's do it!

288
00:18:07,685 --> 00:18:08,618
What is it?

289
00:18:08,618 --> 00:18:12,485
Hey, shot first, questions later.
Here we go. Post time!

290
00:18:13,685 --> 00:18:14,885
Mmm!

291
00:18:17,085 --> 00:18:18,686
Whoo-hoo!

292
00:18:22,152 --> 00:18:25,752
Now, is that a tasty beverage
or is that a tasty beverage?

293
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:27,084
What the fuck is it?!

294
00:18:27,084 --> 00:18:28,684
Chartreuse.

295
00:18:28,684 --> 00:18:31,818
The only liquor so good
they named a color after it.

296
00:18:33,618 --> 00:18:35,085
<i>Who's down for dos Chartreuse?</i>

297
00:18:35,218 --> 00:18:37,351
Not me.

298
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:39,151
I'm going out for a smoke.

299
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:41,485
Okay, but careful where you keep
that hot flame, all right?

300
00:18:41,618 --> 00:18:43,085
You 'll blow up the joint.

301
00:18:52,085 --> 00:18:54,017
##

302
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,152
Drinks.
What can we get you?

303
00:18:57,218 --> 00:18:58,284
Shanna Banana?

304
00:18:58,351 --> 00:19:00,817
Another big-ass
Long Island iced tea.

305
00:19:00,884 --> 00:19:03,684
Bombay Sapphire
and tonic with no ice.

306
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:05,417
Good boy.

307
00:19:26,217 --> 00:19:27,284
Oh, hey, Punky.

308
00:19:27,284 --> 00:19:29,883
Uh, one of the lights
is off in the parking lot. Flip it.

309
00:20:02,283 --> 00:20:04,483
- Oh! Jesus Christ!
- Whoa-ho!

310
00:20:05,616 --> 00:20:07,616
You scared the fuck out of me,
you shitty asshole!

311
00:20:07,683 --> 00:20:10,083
I swear, Arlene.
I was not trying to scare you.

312
00:20:10,283 --> 00:20:11,950
I just... got lucky.

313
00:20:12,016 --> 00:20:13,684
Oh, hardee-fucking-har.

314
00:20:13,684 --> 00:20:15,084
- Let's go inside.
- Wait a minute.

315
00:20:15,151 --> 00:20:17,950
- Why?
- I was thinkin' we could make out.

316
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:18,883
What, on a porch?

317
00:20:18,883 --> 00:20:20,816
Not even in the bar,
but in front of the entrance?

318
00:20:20,883 --> 00:20:22,817
- Forget it.
- No, in my car.

319
00:20:22,884 --> 00:20:25,351
What, out there?
It's wet as fucking 'Nam out there.

320
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:26,950
Not in my car it's not.

321
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,416
Look, you won't get wet.

322
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,682
I promise you.

323
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:35,950
You know, most guys
wouldn't brag about that.

324
00:20:36,016 --> 00:20:37,683
Ha ha ha.

325
00:20:37,683 --> 00:20:39,416
I mean...
you know what I mean.

326
00:20:39,483 --> 00:20:41,416
Look, I know you guys
are going to Lake L.B.J.

327
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,882
and we can't come.

328
00:20:43,815 --> 00:20:45,416
I wanna make out...

329
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:48,150
Okay, just stop with the whining.
It's not attractive.

330
00:20:53,883 --> 00:20:57,749
I don't want it super fucking obvious
to everybody in the bar we've been gone,

331
00:20:57,815 --> 00:21:01,283
- so we'll make out for six minutes, deal?
- Great.

332
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,550
No, no, no.
Deal or no deal?

333
00:21:02,683 --> 00:21:04,749
If you 're gonna whine
when I pull the plug in six minutes,

334
00:21:04,815 --> 00:21:07,082
we could just walk back
inside the fucking bar right now.

335
00:21:07,082 --> 00:21:08,615
- Deal. No whining.
- And no begging.

336
00:21:08,682 --> 00:21:11,015
And no begging.
When you say "done," it's done.

337
00:21:11,082 --> 00:21:12,950
I'm gonna remember
you said that.

338
00:21:13,016 --> 00:21:14,149
Okay, let's go.

339
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:20,082
Oh, you got two jobs... kiss good
and make sure my hair don't get wet.

340
00:21:28,815 --> 00:21:32,282
##

341
00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:43,349
<i># It was early. early one morning #</i>

342
00:21:43,482 --> 00:21:46,414
<i># When I heard my bulldog bark #</i>

343
00:21:46,481 --> 00:21:49,614
<i># It was Staggolee and Billy Lyons #</i>

344
00:21:49,681 --> 00:21:51,615
<i># Squabblin ' in the dark... #</i>

345
00:21:51,682 --> 00:21:54,082
Now, look, you can't look like
you 're trying to get her out of here

346
00:21:54,215 --> 00:21:55,549
before Christian Simonson shows up,

347
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:58,082
but you 've got to get her out of here
before Christian Simonson shows up.

348
00:21:58,149 --> 00:21:59,082
Yeah, but what's the point?

349
00:21:59,215 --> 00:22:01,014
They're going to Shanna's
daddy's house at Lake L.B.J.,

350
00:22:01,281 --> 00:22:02,214
and it's no guys.

351
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:03,815
Absolutely no guys.

352
00:22:03,815 --> 00:22:06,481
Okay. So after we bring
the girls' drinks,

353
00:22:06,481 --> 00:22:11,014
in fairly rapid order, but not obvious,
we order two more rounds of shots.

354
00:22:11,014 --> 00:22:13,414
You think they're gonna fall for that?

355
00:22:13,414 --> 00:22:15,814
<i>We'll be very convincing.</i>

356
00:22:16,281 --> 00:22:18,482
Now it's time to turn up the volume.
No more fucking around.

357
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:20,082
We go to Jäger shots.

358
00:22:20,682 --> 00:22:23,148
Man, they're not gonna drink Jäger shots.

359
00:22:23,281 --> 00:22:24,681
Dude, as long as
a guy's buying the booze,

360
00:22:24,681 --> 00:22:26,681
<i>a fucking bitch
will drink anything.</i>

361
00:22:26,748 --> 00:22:28,015
Come on, dude, we can
at least get one shot of Jäger

362
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:29,615
down these
fucking bitches' throats.

363
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:31,748
After that, we'll see if they get
another Jäger shot in them.

364
00:22:31,881 --> 00:22:32,748
You never know.

365
00:22:32,814 --> 00:22:35,148
That could be the shot
that puts them past the point of "fuck it."

366
00:22:35,214 --> 00:22:36,947
Then all of a sudden
"no guys at the lake house"

367
00:22:37,013 --> 00:22:38,813
turns into a couple of guys
at the lake house.

368
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,348
My point exactly.

369
00:22:40,414 --> 00:22:42,414
And I know I can at least get
"Shanna Suck-my-banana"

370
00:22:42,481 --> 00:22:45,081
to do a fucking Buttery Nipple shot.
What's Julia's sweet shot?

371
00:22:46,014 --> 00:22:47,613
- Key Lime Pie.
- Oh, come on, dude.

372
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,948
Even fucking Leroy Brown
would do one more for dessert.

373
00:22:53,481 --> 00:22:55,081
Dude, check it out.

374
00:22:55,148 --> 00:22:57,148
I wonder if B.J.
brought the bear with him.

375
00:22:59,548 --> 00:23:00,681
Jesus.

376
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,481
Dude fucking cut himself
falling out of his time machine.

377
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,813
Hi, could I get a chicken suit
for Stroker Ace, please?

378
00:23:12,013 --> 00:23:15,013
<i># See the hole
I shot in his head #</i>

379
00:23:15,013 --> 00:23:17,748
<i># The high sheriff
told the deputy #</i>

380
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:20,681
<i># Get your pistols
and come with me #</i>

381
00:23:20,814 --> 00:23:24,080
<i># We got to go arrest
a bad man #</i>

382
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,280
<i># Known as Staggolee... #</i>

383
00:23:29,747 --> 00:23:32,614
<i># They laid them on the shelf</i>

384
00:23:32,614 --> 00:23:35,480
<i># If you want
that bad man Staggolee #</i>

385
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,879
<i># You 'll have to arrest him yourself</i>

386
00:23:38,946 --> 00:23:41,412
<i># The high sheriff
asked the bartender... #</i>

387
00:23:41,479 --> 00:23:43,480
And where did you two disappear to?

388
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,680
I had to get something
out of the car,

389
00:23:44,747 --> 00:23:47,880
and Nate was gentlemanly enough
to escort me with his umbrella.

390
00:23:47,947 --> 00:23:49,746
Ah, good for you, Nate.

391
00:23:49,812 --> 00:23:52,147
You see that pretty girl
sitting by herself at the bar?

392
00:23:54,812 --> 00:23:56,413
Who, the dirty hippie?

393
00:23:56,413 --> 00:23:58,280
Meow. She's not a hippie.

394
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,413
She might as well be a hippie.

395
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,680
Thank you, Timmy boy.

396
00:24:03,613 --> 00:24:06,012
Well, do you know
what just happened to her?

397
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:08,747
No, but I know she's
a skinny, fake, blonde bitch.

398
00:24:11,146 --> 00:24:13,612
Oh, I'm sorry.
You were telling a story?

399
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:14,679
What about her?

400
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,412
Hey, Warren!

401
00:24:18,479 --> 00:24:21,479
Is there anybody you could
vouch for to give me a ride home?

402
00:24:23,347 --> 00:24:26,412
Fair lady, your chariot awaits.

403
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:28,212
You 've been eavesdropping?

404
00:24:28,346 --> 00:24:30,879
There's eavesdropping
and "can't help but hear."

405
00:24:30,946 --> 00:24:32,880
I think I belong
in the latter category.

406
00:24:34,147 --> 00:24:35,747
So, uh, Icy Hot.

407
00:24:35,813 --> 00:24:38,012
You 're offering me a ride home?

408
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:41,478
I'm offering you a lift if when
I'm ready to leave, you are, too.

409
00:24:41,678 --> 00:24:43,678
And when are you
thinking about leaving?

410
00:24:43,811 --> 00:24:45,679
Truthfully,
I'm not thinking about it.

411
00:24:46,212 --> 00:24:49,412
But when I do,
you will be the first to know.

412
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,811
Will you be able
to, uh, drive later?

413
00:24:51,811 --> 00:24:53,811
I know looks can be deceiving.

414
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,612
But I'm a teetotaler.

415
00:24:56,679 --> 00:24:58,679
I've been drinking
club soda and lime all night,

416
00:24:58,879 --> 00:25:00,679
and now I'm building up
to my big drink.

417
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:04,946
- Which is what?
- Virgin piña colada.

418
00:25:05,746 --> 00:25:08,545
Okay. Why would
someone who doesn't drink

419
00:25:08,611 --> 00:25:11,346
spend hours at a bar drinking water?

420
00:25:11,412 --> 00:25:14,945
You know, a bar offers
all kind of things other than alcohol.

421
00:25:15,011 --> 00:25:17,411
Mmm. Really?

422
00:25:17,478 --> 00:25:18,745
Like what?

423
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:21,878
Women.

424
00:25:21,945 --> 00:25:24,278
Nacho grande platters.

425
00:25:24,345 --> 00:25:26,812
The fellowship
of some fascinating individuals,

426
00:25:26,879 --> 00:25:27,945
like Warren here.

427
00:25:29,211 --> 00:25:30,745
Alcohol is just a lubricant

428
00:25:30,811 --> 00:25:34,011
for all the individual
encounters that a barroom offers.

429
00:25:34,078 --> 00:25:36,412
Ooh. Is that cowboy wisdom?

430
00:25:36,479 --> 00:25:38,411
I'm not a cowboy, Pam.

431
00:25:39,878 --> 00:25:40,878
I'm a stuntman.

432
00:25:40,878 --> 00:25:45,210
But that's a very
easy mistake to make.

433
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:47,145
How do you know my name?

434
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:50,211
When you were talking with Warren...

435
00:25:50,345 --> 00:25:51,611
couldn't help but overhear.

436
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:54,210
Fair enough.

437
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,944
So what's your name, Icy?

438
00:25:57,211 --> 00:25:58,611
Stuntman Mike.

439
00:25:59,611 --> 00:26:01,011
Stuntman Mike's your name?

440
00:26:01,011 --> 00:26:03,745
Tsk. You ask anybody.

441
00:26:05,011 --> 00:26:06,211
Hey, Warren.

442
00:26:06,211 --> 00:26:07,678
Who is this guy?

443
00:26:07,678 --> 00:26:09,411
Stuntman Mike.

444
00:26:09,411 --> 00:26:11,410
And who the hell
is Stuntman Mike?

445
00:26:11,477 --> 00:26:12,611
He's a stuntman.

446
00:26:12,678 --> 00:26:15,410
Warren! Six shots of Wild Turkey!

447
00:26:15,477 --> 00:26:18,077
<i># I' ve just got to know #</i>

448

449
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:24,477

##

453
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:31,610
Yeah!

454
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:35,610
Let's do 'em!

455
00:26:35,744 --> 00:26:37,211
<i>Salud.</i>

456
00:26:37,411 --> 00:26:39,078
Down the snatch.

457
00:26:39,078 --> 00:26:42,410
You know, Pam,
I think it's time for my big drink.

458
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:46,809
Well, Stuntman Mike,
since I have a tab here,

459
00:26:47,076 --> 00:26:49,076
can I buy you that
virgin piña colada?

460
00:26:49,076 --> 00:26:51,210
Thank you, Pam.
That'd be lovely.

461
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,677
Warren!

462
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:55,677
A, uh, virgin piña colada
for my stuntman friend

463
00:26:55,677 --> 00:26:58,343
and I'll have another
Cadillac Cabo Wabo margarita.

464
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:00,077
Cabo Wabo, virgin.

<i># People. I' ve been misled #</i>

467

468

- Ah!
- Hey, if it ain't Lanna-Frank.

475
00:28:01,476 --> 00:28:02,676
Mwah.

476
00:28:02,743 --> 00:28:04,008
- Hey, baby.
- How are you?

477

<i>- # In my life before #
- Hey, what's up?</i>

478
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:06,676
Hey!

479
00:28:06,676 --> 00:28:09,209
Hey, what's shakin', bacon?

480
00:28:09,209 --> 00:28:11,143
Hey.

481
00:28:11,209 --> 00:28:13,943
<i># Go wrong as I do today #</i>

482
00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:16,809

- Well, let's scootch over, now.</i>

483
00:28:16,876 --> 00:28:18,809
It's about fucking time.

484
00:28:18,876 --> 00:28:21,075
Well, beggars can't be choosers.

485
00:28:21,675 --> 00:28:23,675
Take a picture.
It lasts longer.

486
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:26,008
What?

487
00:28:26,075 --> 00:28:27,142
That table.

488
00:28:27,275 --> 00:28:29,008
Seems to keep,
um, getting your attention.

489
00:28:29,142 --> 00:28:31,408
Is that the girl
from the billboard outside?

490
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:32,476
Yep.

491
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:35,675
She sure is a striking-looking woman.

492
00:28:35,675 --> 00:28:37,542
It's got gin, tequila, Jäger...

493
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:38,542
Look at that hair.

494
00:28:38,608 --> 00:28:40,008
Lots of leave-in conditioner.

495
00:28:41,408 --> 00:28:43,343
Is that jealousy I detect?

496
00:28:43,409 --> 00:28:47,275
Hardly. But if you want
to get with, uh, Jungle Julia,

497
00:28:47,342 --> 00:28:49,008
there's a real easy way to do that.

498
00:28:49,275 --> 00:28:50,607
Really, what would that be?

499
00:28:50,674 --> 00:28:53,874
Get famous. You won't have
to find her... she'll find you.

500
00:28:54,074 --> 00:28:57,275
And you don't even want to know
what she did for that billboard.

501
00:28:57,342 --> 00:28:58,875
Enjoy it, cocksucker.

502
00:28:58,942 --> 00:29:00,275
You 've earned it.

503
00:29:00,275 --> 00:29:02,207
What did she ever do to you?

504
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:04,742
We went to school together
from kindergarten through high school.

505
00:29:04,808 --> 00:29:06,742
That's what she did to me.

506
00:29:06,742 --> 00:29:09,208
She was her height right now at 12.

507
00:29:09,342 --> 00:29:11,075
She was a monster.

508
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:14,942
Half the guys she still fucks
she used to terrorize in the fifth grade.

509
00:29:15,008 --> 00:29:17,607
And she used to beat you up
and take your chocolate milk, huh?

510
00:29:17,807 --> 00:29:19,208
That pituitary case?

511
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:20,875
Might have kicked my ass
a couple of times...

512
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:23,607
sorry, I'm built like a girl,
not a black man...

513
00:29:23,874 --> 00:29:27,207
but I'd die before I ever gave
Julia Lucai my chocolate milk.

514
00:29:57,674 --> 00:30:01,274
Hey! Are you
famous or somethin'?

515
00:30:01,274 --> 00:30:02,541
Or somethin'.

516
00:30:02,607 --> 00:30:04,073
No, no, no. Really.

517
00:30:05,006 --> 00:30:06,874
Hey, what do... what do you do?

518
00:30:07,741 --> 00:30:08,940
Really?

519
00:30:09,006 --> 00:30:12,674
What I do is work my ass off to get
my own record label off the ground,

520
00:30:12,874 --> 00:30:17,074
but why that girl wanted a picture of me
is because I'm a local D.J.

521
00:30:19,473 --> 00:30:20,873
Wait a minute.

522
00:30:22,141 --> 00:30:25,473
You 've got a billboard
by Big Kahuna Burger, don't you?

523
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,006
Yeah.

524
00:30:27,073 --> 00:30:29,340
I got one there, too, Zatoichi.

525
00:30:32,006 --> 00:30:33,206
Yeah.

526
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,406
Jungle Julia Lucai.

527
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,341
Stuntman Mike McKay.

528
00:30:38,407 --> 00:30:39,674
Well.

529
00:30:39,806 --> 00:30:42,740
Good to meet you, Stuntman Mike.

530
00:30:42,806 --> 00:30:45,073
My friends and I are going
to continue to get our weed on.

531
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,340
Would you care for some?

532
00:30:46,406 --> 00:30:47,874
Thank you, Julia,

533
00:30:47,874 --> 00:30:50,673
but just the same...
no thanks.

534
00:30:50,673 --> 00:30:52,073
- Suit yourself.
- But you know...

535
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,673
Oh, shit.

536
00:31:03,673 --> 00:31:04,873
Ah! My God.

537
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:08,606
Sorry. It's nothing.

538
00:31:12,073 --> 00:31:13,406
What the fuck was that?

539
00:31:17,806 --> 00:31:19,606
You got some voucher here.

540
00:31:19,673 --> 00:31:21,273
I asked him
what movies you worked on.

541
00:31:21,273 --> 00:31:22,939
No fuckin' clue.

542
00:31:23,005 --> 00:31:26,073
Well, technically I really don't know
if he's ever done anything for sure.

543
00:31:26,206 --> 00:31:29,005
<i>I mean, he shows me
an episode of High Chaparral.</i>

544
00:31:29,072 --> 00:31:30,472
a guy falls off a horse,

545
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:31,472
he says it's him.

546
00:31:33,272 --> 00:31:35,405
<i>You know the show The Virginian?</i>

547
00:31:37,072 --> 00:31:39,673
Yeah, well, there was another
actor on that show, Gary Clarke,

548
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,473
and I looked like him a bit...

549
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:44,605
well, obviously
before I cut myself shaving.

550
00:31:44,672 --> 00:31:46,539
Tsk. Aww, I like it.

551
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:50,673
Well, damn, if you ain't so sweet
you make sugar taste just like salt.

552
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:54,005
<i>Anyway, I did a lot of Virginians
doubling Gary Clarke.</i>

553
00:31:54,139 --> 00:31:57,605
<i>And, uh... then that show turned
into The Men of Shiloh.</i>

554
00:31:57,804 --> 00:32:00,338
they brought on Lee Majors,
and I doubled him.

555
00:32:00,404 --> 00:32:03,539
From that point on
I specialized mostly in car stunts.

556
00:32:03,605 --> 00:32:07,072
<i>Yeah, I did damn near
the whole third season of Vega$ .</i>

557
00:32:07,072 --> 00:32:09,204
I was Robert Urich's driving double.

558
00:32:09,271 --> 00:32:12,005
<i>And then Bob
did another show, Gavilan.</i>

559
00:32:12,072 --> 00:32:14,472
and he brought me
with him on that, till...

560
00:32:16,272 --> 00:32:17,472
And after that...

561
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:24,604
Do you know any of these shows
or people I'm talkin' about?

562
00:32:24,738 --> 00:32:26,071
Sorry.

563
00:32:26,071 --> 00:32:27,005
- No?
- Mm-mm.

564
00:32:27,139 --> 00:32:28,739
No, no.

565
00:32:31,271 --> 00:32:36,204
So how exactly does one
become a stuntman, Stuntman Mike?

566
00:32:38,404 --> 00:32:42,472
Well, in Hollywood, anybody fool enough
to throw himself down a flight of stairs

567
00:32:42,472 --> 00:32:45,004
can usually find somebody
to pay him for it.

568
00:32:45,271 --> 00:32:48,604
But really I got into the business the way
most people get into the stunt business.

569
00:32:48,604 --> 00:32:49,871
How's that?

570
00:32:50,071 --> 00:32:52,272
- My brother got me in it.
- Well, who's your brother?

571
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:53,739
Stuntman Bob.

572
00:33:06,738 --> 00:33:07,871
I'm ready to blaze!

573
00:33:07,938 --> 00:33:10,670
Finally, yeah.
You need to catch up with us.

574
00:33:10,737 --> 00:33:12,937
- Now the party can start.
- Yep.

575
00:33:13,003 --> 00:33:16,204
Anywho, I'm sorry.
You forgive me?

576
00:33:17,604 --> 00:33:21,671
But you have to be real nice to me
for the whole rest of the time I'm here.

577
00:33:21,871 --> 00:33:23,871
Promise.
You ready to go to the lake?

578
00:33:23,871 --> 00:33:24,804
Mm-hmm.

579
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:27,603
- How about your friend, bring him?
- I thought no boys.

580
00:33:27,603 --> 00:33:29,871
If you really want him to come,
Shanna won't mind.

581
00:33:29,871 --> 00:33:32,337
So how about it?
Boys or just us girls?

582
00:33:32,403 --> 00:33:34,003
Mmm, us girls.

583
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,270
Good idea.

584
00:33:37,203 --> 00:33:38,270
Ladies?

585
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,471
Thanks.

586
00:33:42,537 --> 00:33:44,203
Cheers, Butterfly.

587
00:33:46,538 --> 00:33:50,737
"The woods are lovely,
dark, and deep...

588
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,470
"And I have promises to keep,

589
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:55,804
And miles to go
before I sleep."

590
00:33:55,804 --> 00:33:57,737
Did you hear me, Butterfly?

591
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:02,536
"Miles to go
before you sleep."

592
00:34:04,469 --> 00:34:05,802
Sorry, Stuntman Burt...

593
00:34:05,802 --> 00:34:07,003
Mike.

594
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,470
Mike.

595
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:10,470
She already broke off that dance.

596
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:11,803
Is that true?

597
00:34:13,402 --> 00:34:15,870
Did I miss my chance?

598
00:34:18,603 --> 00:34:20,537
Do I frighten you?

599
00:34:24,803 --> 00:34:26,603
Is it my scar?

600
00:34:28,669 --> 00:34:30,336
It's your car.

601
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,403
Ah, yeah, I know.

602
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,536
Sorry.

603
00:34:34,602 --> 00:34:36,336
It's my mom's car.

604
00:34:38,669 --> 00:34:40,269
Have you been following us?

605
00:34:40,402 --> 00:34:43,069
No, but that's
what I love about Austin...

606
00:34:43,069 --> 00:34:45,202
it's just so damn small.

607
00:34:45,269 --> 00:34:47,870
- You 've seen this guy before?
- I saw him outside of Guero's.

608
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:50,269
And I saw you outside Guero's, too.

609
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:53,936
You saw my car,
I saw your legs.

610
00:34:54,002 --> 00:34:57,203
Now, look, I ain't stalking y'all,
but I didn't say I wasn't a wolf.

611
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,137
So you really weren't following us?

612
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:02,869
I'm not following you, Butterfly.
I just... got lucky.

613
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:09,202
So, how about that lap dance?

614
00:35:09,269 --> 00:35:10,869
Sorry, it was a one-time only offer,

615
00:35:11,002 --> 00:35:13,269
and she did it
earlier this evening at Antone's.

616
00:35:14,602 --> 00:35:16,601
- No, she didn't.
- How do you know?

617
00:35:16,601 --> 00:35:18,602
I'm good that way.

618
00:35:18,669 --> 00:35:22,469
- Tsk. And you look a little touchéd.
- What's "touchéd"?

619
00:35:22,469 --> 00:35:23,669
Wounded, slightly.

620
00:35:23,669 --> 00:35:24,869
Why should I be wounded?

621
00:35:24,869 --> 00:35:27,736
Because you expected guys
to be pestering you all night,

622
00:35:27,802 --> 00:35:30,469
but from your look I can tell
nobody pestered you at all.

623
00:35:31,668 --> 00:35:33,869
That kind of hurt your feelings
a little bit, didn't it?

624
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:40,668
There are few things as fetching
as a bruised ego on a beautiful angel.

625
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:45,201
So...

626
00:35:46,401 --> 00:35:50,136
How about that lap dance?

627
00:35:51,336 --> 00:35:53,868
I think I'm going
to have to give you a rain check.

628
00:35:56,601 --> 00:35:58,669
Well, since you 'll be leaving
in the next couple of days,

629
00:35:58,802 --> 00:36:00,669
that rain check'll be worthless.

630
00:36:02,868 --> 00:36:03,868
But that's okay.

631
00:36:05,601 --> 00:36:07,867
I understand
if I make you uncomfortable.

632
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,400
You 're still a nice girl.

633
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,068
And I still like you.

634
00:36:13,535 --> 00:36:15,601
But I must warn you of something.

635
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:19,134
You know how people say,

636
00:36:19,267 --> 00:36:20,868
"You 're okay in my book,"

637
00:36:20,935 --> 00:36:24,068
or, "In my book, that's no good."

638
00:36:24,135 --> 00:36:29,601
Well, I actually have a book.

639
00:36:29,668 --> 00:36:33,400
And everybody
I ever meet goes in this book.

640
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,668
And now I've met you,
and you 're goin' in the book.

641
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,800
Except...

642
00:36:40,867 --> 00:36:44,867
I'm afraid I must file you...

643
00:36:44,867 --> 00:36:46,867
under...

644
00:36:46,867 --> 00:36:48,200
"Chicken Shit."

645
00:36:48,468 --> 00:36:50,534
And what if I did it?

646
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,668
Well, I definitely couldn't
file you under "Chicken Shit,"

647
00:36:52,868 --> 00:36:54,867
then, now, could I?

648
00:36:54,934 --> 00:36:56,200
What's your name again?

649
00:36:57,467 --> 00:37:00,267
- Stuntman Mike.
- Well, Stuntman Mike...

650
00:37:00,334 --> 00:37:01,868
I'm Butterfly.

651
00:37:01,935 --> 00:37:06,267
My friend Jungle Julia over here says
that jukebox inside is pretty impressive.

652
00:37:06,334 --> 00:37:08,000
Yeah, it is.

653
00:37:08,134 --> 00:37:09,067
Yeah.

654
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:12,266
Well, why don't you go
get ready for your lap dance?

655
00:37:25,867 --> 00:37:28,667
What about "kind of cute,
kind of hot, kind of sexy,

656
00:37:28,734 --> 00:37:30,400
"hysterically funny
but not funny-looking guy

657
00:37:30,467 --> 00:37:33,200
who you could fuck"
did you not understand?

658
00:37:33,267 --> 00:37:36,066

We're gonna go somewhere else,
gonna go hang out.

710
00:40:21,931 --> 00:40:22,864
Ready to go?

711
00:40:22,864 --> 00:40:24,064
Yeah.

712
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:25,797
- Bye.
Bye.

713
00:40:28,996 --> 00:40:31,131
I think you got Mike laid tonight.

714
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,731
Lookin' good, Cannonball Run!

715
00:40:35,797 --> 00:40:37,664
He's just giving me a ride.

716
00:40:37,731 --> 00:40:38,664
Oh, no doubt.

717
00:40:38,797 --> 00:40:40,997
Have a nice ride!

718
00:40:42,464 --> 00:40:44,130
Look, double fucks.

719
00:40:48,263 --> 00:40:50,196
I am not gonna fuck him.

720
00:40:50,196 --> 00:40:51,663
I can hear you.

721
00:40:52,996 --> 00:40:56,263
- He's old enough to be my dad.
- I can still hear you.

722
00:40:59,463 --> 00:41:00,596
Bye.

723
00:41:00,663 --> 00:41:01,664
Bye-bye!

724
00:41:07,796 --> 00:41:09,596
Wow, that's fucking scary.

725
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,597
Yeah, well, I wanted it
to be impressive and...

726
00:41:11,731 --> 00:41:13,731
scary tends to impress.

727
00:41:15,063 --> 00:41:16,196
Is it safe?

728
00:41:16,263 --> 00:41:18,196
No, it's better than safe.

729
00:41:18,263 --> 00:41:19,795
It's death-proof.

730
00:41:19,862 --> 00:41:22,262
How do you make a car death-proof?

731
00:41:22,329 --> 00:41:23,996
Well, that's what stuntmen do.

732
00:41:24,263 --> 00:41:26,663
You 've seen a movie where
a car gets into some smash-up

733
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:29,063
there ain't no way in hell
anybody's walking away from?

734
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:29,995
Yeah.

735
00:41:30,262 --> 00:41:32,463
Well, how do you
think they accomplish that?

736
00:41:32,663 --> 00:41:34,463
CGI?

737
00:41:34,662 --> 00:41:38,463
Well, unfortunately, Pam, nowadays
more often than not, you 're right.

738
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:40,663
Tsk. But back
in the all-or-nothin' days...

739
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:44,330
<i>Vanishing Point days,
the Dirty Mary Crazy Larry days,</i>

740
00:41:44,463 --> 00:41:46,062
<i>the White Line Fever days...</i>

741
00:41:46,062 --> 00:41:48,930
real cars smashing into real cars.

742
00:41:48,996 --> 00:41:51,529
Real dumb people driving 'em.

743
00:41:51,595 --> 00:41:54,462
So, give the stunt team
the car you want to smash up,

744
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,995
they take her and reinforce
that fucker everywhere and...

745
00:41:57,062 --> 00:41:58,062
<i>Voila!</i>

746
00:41:58,062 --> 00:42:01,395
You got yourself
a death-proof automobile.

747
00:42:02,862 --> 00:42:06,462
That makes sense. I just didn't know
you could make a car death-proof.

748
00:42:06,462 --> 00:42:10,062
Well, I can drive this baby into
a brick wall doing 125 miles an hour.

749
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,195
Just for the experience.

750
00:42:18,662 --> 00:42:20,862
Why is your passenger seat in a box?

751
00:42:20,929 --> 00:42:22,328
Well, this is a movie car.

752
00:42:22,461 --> 00:42:25,862
Sometimes when you 're shootin' a crash,
director wants to put a camera in the car...

753
00:42:25,862 --> 00:42:27,995
you know, shoot the crash
from the inside.

754
00:42:27,995 --> 00:42:30,795
That's where you put the camera.
They call it a "crash box."

755
00:42:33,461 --> 00:42:35,062
There you go.

756
00:42:35,129 --> 00:42:37,394
You know, when you
asked to drive me home,

757
00:42:37,461 --> 00:42:39,195
you didn't mention your car
didn't have a passenger seat.

758
00:42:39,262 --> 00:42:42,262
Yeah, well, actually,
I didn't ask to drive you home.

759
00:42:42,262 --> 00:42:43,995
You asked me for a ride,
and I said, "Yes."

760
00:42:44,262 --> 00:42:45,462
But look at the bright side, Pam...

761
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:48,328
I won't be gettin' fresh,
putting my hand on your knee.

762
00:42:49,995 --> 00:42:51,662
That is a bright side.

763
00:42:52,794 --> 00:42:53,928
I thought so.

764
00:43:18,861 --> 00:43:20,194
Well, Pam...

765
00:43:20,194 --> 00:43:21,394
which way are you going?

766
00:43:21,661 --> 00:43:23,261
- Left or right?
- Right.

767
00:43:23,394 --> 00:43:25,260
Ah, that's too bad.

768
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:26,860
Why?

769
00:43:26,927 --> 00:43:30,594
Well, because it was a 50/50 shot
on whether you 'd be going left or right.

770
00:43:30,661 --> 00:43:32,661
You see, we're both going left.

771
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:34,660
You could have just
as easily been going left, too,

772
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,060
and if that was the case,

773
00:43:36,127 --> 00:43:38,661
it would have been a while
before you started getting scared.

774
00:43:38,661 --> 00:43:41,061
But since
you 're going the other way,

775
00:43:41,061 --> 00:43:42,594
I'm afraid...

776
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:45,861
you 're gonna
have to start getting scared...

777
00:43:45,928 --> 00:43:46,994
immediately.

778
00:43:47,061 --> 00:43:48,128
What the fuck?!

779
00:43:57,193 --> 00:43:59,060
Cocksucking motherfucker!

780
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,660
Just fucking let me out of here!

781
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,260
I'll fucking rip your fucking...

782
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,593
Stop the fucking car!

783
00:44:03,593 --> 00:44:05,460
Why are you being such a shit?

784
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,727
Okay.

785
00:44:45,793 --> 00:44:47,260
Here's the thing.

786
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,260
I get it.

787
00:44:49,327 --> 00:44:51,860
l... I know it's a joke,
and super funny.

788
00:44:52,592 --> 00:44:56,260
Um, but if you just stop right now,

789
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,659
you know, and... and let me out,

790
00:44:58,659 --> 00:45:01,926
I'll never tell anybody
because I know it's a joke.

791
00:45:02,059 --> 00:45:03,326
I know all about jokes.

792
00:45:03,392 --> 00:45:04,726
Ha ha ha!

793
00:45:04,792 --> 00:45:08,126
I promise everything'll be fine.

794
00:45:08,192 --> 00:45:10,527
Just... just... just let me out.

795
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:11,593
Please?

796
00:45:11,593 --> 00:45:13,326
- And... and... and...
- Hey, Pam!

797
00:45:14,392 --> 00:45:17,659
Remember when I said
this car was death proof?

798
00:45:17,792 --> 00:45:21,060
Well, that wasn't a lie.

799
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,459
This car is 100% death proof.

800
00:45:24,326 --> 00:45:27,192
Only to get the benefit of it, honey...

801
00:45:27,192 --> 00:45:30,058
you really need to be sittin' in my seat.

802
00:46:06,058 --> 00:46:09,458
Now I gotta catch me
my other girlfriends.

803
00:46:23,392 --> 00:46:24,326
No, no, no, no, no, no.

804
00:46:24,392 --> 00:46:27,458
It's Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick and Tich.

805
00:46:28,391 --> 00:46:29,858
So, you got it?

806
00:46:29,925 --> 00:46:32,657
Thanks, honey.
You 're gonna play it next song, right?

807
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:35,591
Good boy.

808
00:46:37,058 --> 00:46:38,658
Growl!

809
00:46:38,725 --> 00:46:40,725
Bye-bye.

810
00:46:40,791 --> 00:46:42,257
Who do you want to hear?

811
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:43,991
Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick, and Tich.

812
00:46:44,258 --> 00:46:45,458
Who?

813
00:46:45,458 --> 00:46:48,858
Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick, and Tich.

814
00:46:49,058 --> 00:46:50,325
Who the fuck are they?

815
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:53,058
For your information,
Pete Townshend, at one point,

816
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:54,791
almost quit The Who,
and if he had,

817
00:46:54,858 --> 00:46:56,458
he would have ended up in this group,

818
00:46:56,458 --> 00:47:00,125
thus making it Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick, Tich, and Pete.

819
00:47:00,125 --> 00:47:01,658
And if you ask me,
he should have.

820
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:04,990
That's my boy!

821
00:47:05,124 --> 00:47:08,124

I want to hear
this part of the song louder!

841
00:49:37,055 --> 00:49:38,654
Do you remember anything?

842
00:49:40,454 --> 00:49:42,722
Uh... l... I don't remember.

843
00:49:46,055 --> 00:49:47,522
Doctor Block.

844
00:49:54,054 --> 00:49:56,588
<i>Self-restraints to Room 310.</i>

845
00:49:56,588 --> 00:49:58,922
<i>Self-restraints to Room 310.</i>

846
00:50:00,055 --> 00:50:05,254
Well. What's the patient's
prognosis, Dr. Block?

847
00:50:05,254 --> 00:50:07,388
I don't really see
it's any of your business.

848
00:50:07,388 --> 00:50:09,254
Come on now, Sis.

849
00:50:09,321 --> 00:50:11,454
You just tell us.

850
00:50:11,454 --> 00:50:12,854
How bad is he?

851
00:50:17,321 --> 00:50:18,987
He got banged up real good.

852
00:50:19,054 --> 00:50:23,188
Busted nose, broken collarbone,
smashed up his left index finger.

853
00:50:23,322 --> 00:50:24,388
Is that it?

854
00:50:26,254 --> 00:50:27,854
He was real lucky.

855
00:50:29,987 --> 00:50:31,588
That'll be all?

856
00:50:31,722 --> 00:50:34,922
Well, that's more than enough,
and I wanna thank you, Dr. Block.

857
00:50:38,587 --> 00:50:39,987
Son of a bitch.

858
00:50:41,453 --> 00:50:43,053
So, Pop.

859
00:50:43,053 --> 00:50:44,654
What do you think?

860
00:50:44,654 --> 00:50:46,387
Well, Son Number One,

861
00:50:46,387 --> 00:50:50,387
what I think is so goddamn ghoulish
I hesitate to speak it out loud.

862
00:50:51,453 --> 00:50:53,587
Well, give it a shot.

863
00:50:53,654 --> 00:50:56,453
Well, what we have here
is a case of vehicular homicide.

864
00:50:56,654 --> 00:50:59,254
That ol' boy in there
murdered them pretty little gals.

865
00:50:59,254 --> 00:51:02,921
I mean, he used a car, not a hatchet,
but they're dead just the same.

866
00:51:04,454 --> 00:51:07,386
Well, what are you gonna do?

867
00:51:07,386 --> 00:51:09,121
Not a goddamn thing.

868
00:51:09,121 --> 00:51:11,321
D.A. says there ain't no crime here.

869
00:51:12,186 --> 00:51:16,920
Every one of them gals was swimming
in alcohol and floatin' on weed,

870
00:51:16,986 --> 00:51:20,653
and old Hooper in there
came out clean as a whistle.

871
00:51:20,853 --> 00:51:24,987
Now, you actually think that he
premeditatively murdered them gals?

872
00:51:24,987 --> 00:51:26,854
Well, I can't prove it.

873
00:51:26,854 --> 00:51:29,786
But since thinkin' don't cost nothin',
I can think it, and I do.

874
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:33,053
Yeah, but Pop, he got
pretty banged up himself.

875
00:51:33,253 --> 00:51:35,654
Well, hell yeah,
he got banged up, but goddamn...

876
00:51:35,721 --> 00:51:38,253
I mean, them pretty little gals in there
look like a goddamn giant

877
00:51:38,453 --> 00:51:40,053
chewed 'em up and spit 'em out.

878
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,453
Did any of 'em survive?

879
00:51:41,453 --> 00:51:43,319
Shit.

880
00:51:43,385 --> 00:51:45,719
Two tons of metal,
200 miles an hour,

881
00:51:45,785 --> 00:51:48,120
flesh and bone
and plain old Newton...

882
00:51:48,186 --> 00:51:50,186
they all princess died.

883
00:51:56,986 --> 00:51:58,320
Why?

884
00:51:58,385 --> 00:52:02,653
Well, I'd guesstimate
it's a sex thing.

885
00:52:02,653 --> 00:52:04,453
The only way I can figure it.

886
00:52:04,653 --> 00:52:09,519
High-velocity impact,
twisted metal, busted glass,

887
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:12,453
all four souls taken
exactly the same time.

888
00:52:13,653 --> 00:52:17,652
Probably the only way that diabolical
degenerate can shoot his goo.

889
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:21,185
Yeah, I think the only thing
we can dream of getting that bastard on

890
00:52:21,252 --> 00:52:24,519
is vehicular manslaughter
for the hitchhiker in the death box.

891
00:52:24,585 --> 00:52:27,386
That was just plain old,
goddamn reckless endangerment.

892
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,319
But I got me a goddamn bartender

893
00:52:30,452 --> 00:52:33,919
gonna testify that ol' Stuntman
Mike didn't drink a drop all night.

894
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:37,386
And his passenger
was left stranded by her date,

895
00:52:37,386 --> 00:52:40,985
in the goddamn rain, no less,
and she asked him for the fucking ride.

896
00:52:41,252 --> 00:52:44,852
Now, on paper, this is gonna look
like he was just trying to help her out.

897
00:52:44,852 --> 00:52:46,984
I mean, that's the way
the jury's gonna see it.

898
00:52:47,251 --> 00:52:49,252
So, what are you gonna do, Pop?

899
00:52:49,319 --> 00:52:50,252
Tsk.

900
00:52:50,452 --> 00:52:53,252
Well, I could take it
upon myself to work the case,

901
00:52:51,785 --> 00:52:53,052
you know, in my off hours.

902
00:52:55,718 --> 00:52:58,652
Search for evidence,
you know, prove my theory.

903
00:52:58,652 --> 00:52:59,919
Alert authorities.

904
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:03,452
Dog that rotten son of a bitch...
wherever he goes, I go.

905
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:08,519
Or I could spend the same
goddamn amount of time and energy

906
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:11,384
following the NASCAR circuit.

907
00:53:11,451 --> 00:53:13,518
Hmm. I've thought about it a lot.

908
00:53:13,584 --> 00:53:16,984
I think I'd have a hell
of a lot happier life if I did the latter.

909
00:53:16,984 --> 00:53:17,918
And just because I can't

910
00:53:17,984 --> 00:53:21,984
punish Old Frankenstein
in there for what he's done,

911
00:53:22,251 --> 00:53:24,784
I'm gonna tell you
like the Lord told John...

912
00:53:24,851 --> 00:53:26,784
if he ever does it again,

913
00:53:26,851 --> 00:53:29,985
I can make goddamn sure
he don't do it in Texas.

914
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:33,584

Are you on the same floor as him?
No, he's on the fourth.

934
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:57,850
- And who's in whose room?
- He's in mine.

935
00:54:57,917 --> 00:54:59,117
And so what happened then?

936
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:03,250
We made out for about ten minutes,
and then I sent him off to his room.

937
00:55:03,317 --> 00:55:06,850
- So how's the Rock as a kisser?
- Mm, he's damn good.

938
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:09,583
He's got them mushy lips,
smooth fingertips.

939
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:11,383
Mm, I love them mushy lips.

940
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:14,517
He's a big guy, so he spins me around
so my back is up against him,

941
00:55:14,583 --> 00:55:16,982
takes his big hand
and puts it on my throat,

942
00:55:17,182 --> 00:55:21,382
tilts my head back and leans over me,
kisses me from behind.

943
00:55:21,382 --> 00:55:22,849
Damn, that sounds sexy!

944
00:55:22,849 --> 00:55:24,449
It was sexy.

945
00:55:24,449 --> 00:55:28,182
But then that was it?
You sent him off? How'd he take it?

946
00:55:28,182 --> 00:55:29,782
Wait a minute, what are we doing here?

947
00:55:29,849 --> 00:55:33,449
If I'm gonna power through and pick up
Zoë at the airport, I need coffee.

948
00:55:33,449 --> 00:55:37,249
Since you 're getting that, can you get
some more vodka and sugar-free Red Bull?

949
00:55:39,516 --> 00:55:40,716
We didn't know you were awake.

950
00:55:40,849 --> 00:55:42,449
I'm not awake. I'm asleep.

951
00:55:42,516 --> 00:55:45,450
But get some more vodka
and some sugar-free Red Bull anyway.

952
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:47,582
And some Red Apple Tans.

953
00:55:47,716 --> 00:55:50,116
Damn, I didn't stop
to get you bitches groceries.

954
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:54,581
- You remember how to get to the airport?
Uh-huh.

955
00:55:54,648 --> 00:55:57,382
Then you should get behind the wheel,
'cause you gonna drive.

956
00:55:59,116 --> 00:56:00,649
Motherfuckers.

957
00:56:16,649 --> 00:56:18,448
They ain't got sugar-free Red Bull.

958
00:56:18,448 --> 00:56:21,116
They got regular Red Bull
and sugar-free G.O. juice.

959
00:56:21,116 --> 00:56:23,715
G.O.
G.O.!

960
00:56:48,049 --> 00:56:53,848
# It's not the way you kiss
that says you 're mine #

961
00:56:57,047 --> 00:57:01,448
# Many, many, many nights go by #

962
00:57:01,448 --> 00:57:07,047
# I sit alone at home and cry over you #

963
00:57:07,047 --> 00:57:10,115
# What can I do #

964
00:57:10,247 --> 00:57:15,448
# Don't want nobody, nobody #

965
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:18,648
# 'Cause, baby, it's you #

966
00:57:27,847 --> 00:57:31,180
# Is it true what they say #

967
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:35,180
# All about you #

968
00:57:37,114 --> 00:57:42,380
# They say you 'll never
ever never be true #

969
00:57:44,847 --> 00:57:49,381
# It doesn't matter what they say #

970
00:57:49,381 --> 00:57:52,847
# I know I'm gonna
love you any old way #

971
00:57:52,914 --> 00:57:55,780
# What would I do #

972
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:58,846
# Without you #

973
00:57:58,979 --> 00:58:01,247
# I don't want nobody... #

974
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:04,180
Where the hell are my keys?
Here they are.

975
00:58:05,447 --> 00:58:08,046
Sorry, I didn't mean to give
you a concert there.

976
00:58:08,113 --> 00:58:10,114
No, it wasn't you.

977
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:12,646
That guy bumped into my feet
when he walked by.

978
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:16,914
I don't know why,
but that kind of creeped me out.

979
00:58:32,113 --> 00:58:35,046
<i># I don 't care
what they saying to me #</i>

980
00:58:41,447 --> 00:58:42,847
Little dick.

981
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:45,913
Clearly.

982
00:58:47,513 --> 00:58:52,314
Since I'm up,
I might as well hit the ATM.

983
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:55,579
Get me a fuckin' smoke.

984
01:00:16,312 --> 01:00:18,045
What?

985
01:00:18,045 --> 01:00:19,978
Did you just see the...

986
01:00:20,045 --> 01:00:20,912
What?

987
01:00:23,178 --> 01:00:24,178
Nothing, honey.

988
01:00:46,912 --> 01:00:47,778
Y'ello.

989
01:00:48,045 --> 01:00:49,244
It's me.

990
01:00:49,311 --> 01:00:50,511
Miss me?

991
01:00:51,844 --> 01:00:54,444
You best get your ass
off Kim's car.

992
01:00:54,511 --> 01:00:58,112
- I've seen Kim sit on it before.
- Her ass ain't your ass.

993
01:00:58,245 --> 01:01:02,377
<i>Okay. So, I think I'm in
this month's issue of Allure.</i>

994
01:01:05,843 --> 01:01:07,310
<i>You got Allure?</i>

995
01:01:07,376 --> 01:01:09,177
Magazines by the window.

996
01:01:23,044 --> 01:01:24,644
Here you are!

997
01:01:27,511 --> 01:01:29,111
You hot mama, you.

998
01:01:29,177 --> 01:01:30,843
See you in a second.

999
01:01:31,043 --> 01:01:33,977
$3.85... out of 20.

1000
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:40,776
And you get 16 and change back.
Thank you very much.

1001
01:01:42,976 --> 01:01:46,176
You know, I got other fashion magazines
for sale behind the counter.

1002
01:01:48,577 --> 01:01:50,910
No, that's okay.
This'll be all.

1003
01:01:50,976 --> 01:01:52,110
Thought I'd ask.

1004
01:01:52,176 --> 01:01:53,910
- Thanks anyway.
- Have a good one.

1005
01:01:56,843 --> 01:01:59,377
<i>I got this month's issue
of Italian Vogue.</i>

1006
01:02:04,443 --> 01:02:05,710
This month's?

1007
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:09,642
Listen to this.

1008
01:02:09,709 --> 01:02:14,176
<i>The Circle A clerk has
this month's issue of Italian Vogue.</i>

1009
01:02:14,243 --> 01:02:15,376
- No way.
- Way!

1010
01:02:15,443 --> 01:02:17,842
<i>I can't believe fuckin' Circle A
carries Italian Vogue.</i>

1011
01:02:17,842 --> 01:02:20,243
It doesn't. It's his own personal copy.

1012
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:22,509
He'll let it go for 27 bucks.

1013
01:02:22,576 --> 01:02:24,310
27 bucks?

1014
01:02:24,376 --> 01:02:26,776
What the fuck do you care?
We're talking about per diem here.

1015
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:29,576
<i>We found an issue of Italian Vogue
in Lebanon, Tennessee.</i>

1016
01:02:29,710 --> 01:02:31,510
We're lucky he's not asking
for fuckin' Krugerrands.

1017
01:02:31,576 --> 01:02:33,575
I'm getting it, and we're
splitting it three ways.

1018
01:02:33,709 --> 01:02:34,909
What, me, you, and Kim?

1019
01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:36,776
<i>Kim doesn't give
a shit about Italian Vogue.</i>

1020
01:02:36,776 --> 01:02:40,309
but Brandy'll come in with us,
and if she won't, Tisla, her sister, will.

1021
01:02:41,109 --> 01:02:43,975
Okay, but if anybody tears out
any sheets I want,

1022
01:02:43,975 --> 01:02:47,242
you gotta make color Xeroxes
of those pages, and I'm not talking Kinko's.

1023
01:02:47,442 --> 01:02:51,176
You take it to the art department
and have them do it fuckin' right.

1024
01:03:08,175 --> 01:03:10,441
Whoo!

1025
01:03:13,909 --> 01:03:15,109
Oh, my God!

1026
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:24,175
Got it!

1027
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:35,374
...the actress...

1028
01:03:46,374 --> 01:03:47,841
Oh, boy.

1029
01:03:50,708 --> 01:03:52,641
Your timing couldn't be better, Zoë.

1030
01:03:52,708 --> 01:03:57,108
It just so happens we're all three
off-duty for the next three days.

1031
01:03:57,174 --> 01:03:59,574
Fuckin' hell! How does that happen?

1032
01:03:59,574 --> 01:04:02,642
I'm doing Lindsay Lohan's makeup,
and she's off for the next three days.

1033
01:04:02,642 --> 01:04:05,442
There's no stunts being filmed
during that time so Kim's free,

1034
01:04:05,442 --> 01:04:09,241
and Lee's on a will-notify
for the four days.

1035
01:04:09,441 --> 01:04:10,841
So how's the shoot going?

1036
01:04:10,841 --> 01:04:12,840
Great. We're having the best time.

1037
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,041
The director, Cecil Evans, is so fun.

1038
01:04:15,108 --> 01:04:18,241
We're making the coolest movie
and partying all the time.

1039
01:04:18,241 --> 01:04:21,707
Hell, yeah. The next job
after this one is definitely gonna suck.

1040
01:04:21,707 --> 01:04:23,640
So let's hear it, ladies.

1041
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,974
Set romances! Who's getting it off?

1042
01:04:26,041 --> 01:04:28,574
That would be Lee and Toolbox.

1043
01:04:28,574 --> 01:04:31,508
Oh, Toolbox!
Name sounds promising.

1044
01:04:31,641 --> 01:04:33,641
- He's a grip.
- What he is is a pervert.

1045
01:04:33,708 --> 01:04:35,974
Well, he just keeps sounding
better and better.

1046
01:04:37,174 --> 01:04:38,040
What's his perversion?

1047
01:04:40,108 --> 01:04:42,440
He likes to watch me pee.

1048
01:04:42,973 --> 01:04:47,307
# Lee is sitting on a toilet
and Toolbox is watching her pee #

1049
01:04:47,373 --> 01:04:49,307
# P-l-S-S-l-N-G #

1050
01:04:49,373 --> 01:04:50,240
Ooh!

1051
01:04:50,573 --> 01:04:52,240
Yeah, but not no more.

1052
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,507
Now she's getting it on
with the Rock.

1053
01:04:54,573 --> 01:04:56,241
You had a one-off with the Rock?

1054
01:04:56,441 --> 01:04:58,640
Well, not the real Rock.
He's this electrician named Bruce.

1055
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:02,507
He looks like the Rock,
so we all just call him the Rock.

1056
01:05:02,573 --> 01:05:04,173
Oh, yeah, this is an all-star crew.

1057
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:07,708
We got a guy who looks like Nic Cage
and Pee Wee Herman, too.

1058
01:05:07,774 --> 01:05:10,107
Kim, dick department.
Let's hear it!

1059
01:05:10,173 --> 01:05:13,440
Mm-mmm, no dick this trip.
I got a man.

1060
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,572
- How long have you had this boyfriend?
- About three months.

1061
01:05:16,639 --> 01:05:18,240
Who'd you steal him from?

1062
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:19,440
Nobody!

1063
01:05:19,573 --> 01:05:21,973
Kim!
- Wha... what?

1064
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:23,640
He totally had a girlfriend.

1065
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:27,173
All of Kim's boyfriends start out
as somebody else's boyfriend.

1066
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,239
I did not steal him!

1067
01:05:29,439 --> 01:05:34,307
I didn't steal any of them;
they just... jumped ship.

1068
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:40,039
- So what's your story, Abernathy?
- Oh, Abbie's got the big Kahuna.

1069
01:05:40,106 --> 01:05:42,773
<i>I had a set crush on Cecil.</i>

1070
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:46,039
Set crush? Nigga, please.
You were his set wife!

1071
01:05:46,039 --> 01:05:48,172
"Were" and "had" being
the key words, here.

1072
01:05:48,306 --> 01:05:50,839
Bitch, you two are still
into each other and you know it.

1073
01:05:50,972 --> 01:05:55,772
Yeah, well, if he's so in love with me,
why did he fuck Darryl Hannah's stand-in?

1074
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:02,839
Yes, men are dogs.
Oh, it's so funny!

1075
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:04,172
Oh, it's so funny!

1076
01:06:04,439 --> 01:06:06,839
Stop acting all hurt.
Your ass just mad.

1077
01:06:06,839 --> 01:06:08,507
Yeah, he's a stand-in fucker.

1078
01:06:08,573 --> 01:06:11,372
You need to get over that shit.
That was two weeks ago.

1079
01:06:11,439 --> 01:06:14,239
Oh, well, now you put it like that...

1080
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:17,438
Oh, I haven't told you the best part.

1081
01:06:17,438 --> 01:06:20,506
He fucked her on my birthday.

1082
01:06:20,572 --> 01:06:23,306
Oh, that's a horse of a different color.

1083
01:06:23,372 --> 01:06:26,106
- Thank you.
- Did he know it was your birthday?

1084
01:06:26,172 --> 01:06:28,771
I mean, he's the director.
He's kind of busy.

1085
01:06:28,771 --> 01:06:33,106
He ate a piece of my birthday cake,
and he got me a present.

1086
01:06:33,172 --> 01:06:35,039
- Wow.
- Yeah... I think he knew.

1087
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:38,172
What did he get you?

1088
01:06:41,572 --> 01:06:43,038
He made me a tape.

1089
01:06:43,105 --> 01:06:44,706
He made you a tape?

1090
01:06:44,772 --> 01:06:46,839
Wait, he didn't burn you a CD?

1091
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:48,305
He made you a tape?

1092
01:06:48,305 --> 01:06:51,171
- Yeah.
- Oh, that is so romantic!

1093
01:06:51,238 --> 01:06:54,238
Yes, I know what you 're gonna say,
so don't even go there.

1094
01:06:54,305 --> 01:06:56,305
This sounds like the test
of true love to me.

1095
01:06:56,305 --> 01:06:59,905
Look, I know you guys like him.
He's likeable.

1096
01:06:59,971 --> 01:07:02,439
But he fucked another woman
on my birthday.

1097
01:07:02,506 --> 01:07:04,838
How can you not be on my side?

1098
01:07:04,838 --> 01:07:06,305
I admit, that sounds bad.

1099
01:07:06,371 --> 01:07:07,571
It is bad!

1100
01:07:07,638 --> 01:07:10,439
It just sounds like there's
a little more to it than that.

1101
01:07:10,439 --> 01:07:11,572
Were you two fucking?

1102
01:07:11,639 --> 01:07:13,105
Hell, no.

1103
01:07:13,105 --> 01:07:14,905
Hello, is your name Abernathy?

1104
01:07:14,971 --> 01:07:15,971
Sorry.

1105
01:07:16,038 --> 01:07:19,370
The answer to your question
is no, of course not.

1106
01:07:19,637 --> 01:07:22,438
<i>What do you mean "No, of course not"?</i>

1107
01:07:22,438 --> 01:07:25,305
The reason Cecil hasn't had
a girlfriend in six years

1108
01:07:25,371 --> 01:07:28,571
is because girls will fuck him,
and if you fuck Cecil,

1109
01:07:28,571 --> 01:07:30,837
you don't become one
of his girlfriends...

1110
01:07:30,904 --> 01:07:33,705
not to say I want to be his girlfriend,

1111
01:07:33,771 --> 01:07:38,705
but if I did want to be his girlfriend,
if I fucked him, I wouldn't be.

1112
01:07:38,838 --> 01:07:44,238
I'd be one of his regulars,
and I'm getting too fuckin' old for that shit.

1113
01:07:44,304 --> 01:07:47,371
- Have you let him do anything?
- Yes!

1114
01:07:49,038 --> 01:07:50,770
I've let him give me a foot massage,

1115
01:07:50,904 --> 01:07:54,637
and when we go to the movies,
I've let him hold my hand.

1116
01:07:54,637 --> 01:07:57,237
Bitch, you might be actin'
like you 12 years old,

1117
01:07:57,370 --> 01:07:58,770
but he just acting like a man.

1118
01:07:58,837 --> 01:08:01,037
You need to break
that nigga off a piece.

1119
01:08:01,037 --> 01:08:02,237
Let me get this straight...

1120
01:08:03,171 --> 01:08:06,370
you 're not fucking him,
you 're not sucking him,

1121
01:08:06,437 --> 01:08:10,237
you 're not giving him any tongue,
but Darryl Hannah's stand-in is?

1122
01:08:10,237 --> 01:08:12,305
Can we just take my sex life
off the table?

1123
01:08:12,371 --> 01:08:15,637
Actually, it was Cecil's sex life
that was on the table...

1124
01:08:15,637 --> 01:08:17,237
and your lack of one.

1125
01:08:22,836 --> 01:08:25,104
Fuck both of you
and your little high-five.

1126
01:08:25,237 --> 01:08:29,370
<i>Before you can claim a nigga,
you got to claim a nigga,</i>

1127
01:08:29,504 --> 01:08:32,303
and you can start by giving
that motherfucker a hand job

1128
01:08:32,369 --> 01:08:34,037
in the back of the van
on Tuesday.

1129
01:08:34,037 --> 01:08:35,237
I'm not gonna do that!

1130
01:08:35,237 --> 01:08:37,704
I know you won't!
But you know who will...

1131
01:08:37,770 --> 01:08:40,570
the bitch that ends up living
in that big-ass mansion of his.

1132
01:08:40,837 --> 01:08:43,637
I haven't entirely agreed
with everything Kim's said,

1133
01:08:43,704 --> 01:08:47,369
but it is true if you 've stretched it out
like you have with Cecil

1134
01:08:47,369 --> 01:08:51,770
and you suddenly get dirty on them,
it blows their mind.

1135
01:08:53,036 --> 01:08:56,436
So Zoë, Kim, and I are
in the Philippines at an outdoor rave.

1136
01:08:56,503 --> 01:08:59,703
<i>What were you working on?
- Three Kicks to the Head. Part Three.</i>

1137
01:08:59,703 --> 01:09:03,036
And, admittedly,
we're a little fucked up.

1138
01:09:03,036 --> 01:09:05,170
Cheers to that.
- Word.

1139
01:09:05,904 --> 01:09:07,104
Cheers.

1140
01:09:07,170 --> 01:09:08,636
So Zoë...

1141
01:09:09,769 --> 01:09:13,436
the genius, wants to take
a picture of me.

1142
01:09:14,570 --> 01:09:17,837
It's dark as hell,
and you can't see shit.

1143
01:09:17,837 --> 01:09:21,436
So she's got her camera
and keeps saying, "Step back a little!"

1144
01:09:21,436 --> 01:09:22,369
So I do.

1145
01:09:22,636 --> 01:09:24,768
Then "A little fu -ther!"

1146
01:09:24,768 --> 01:09:29,236
So I step back a little fu -ther.
Then "A little more!" So I do.

1147
01:09:29,236 --> 01:09:35,035
Then I realize I'm at the edge
of a seven-foot concrete ditch...

1148
01:09:35,102 --> 01:09:37,436
...with God knows how many rocks

1149
01:09:37,503 --> 01:09:41,569
and broken bottles and rats in it,
and if I fell in that fucking thing,

1150
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:43,569
I probably would have broken my neck.

1151
01:09:43,636 --> 01:09:47,236
So I am yelling at her:
"Zoë, you almost killed me!"

1152
01:09:48,836 --> 01:09:52,703
So we laugh about it
and walk a little further,

1153
01:09:52,769 --> 01:09:55,168
and Zoë starts fuckin' around.

1154
01:09:55,235 --> 01:09:59,235
And... bam! ...if she doesn't fall
in the fucking ditch!

1155
01:10:00,568 --> 01:10:02,235
Nice.

1156
01:10:02,435 --> 01:10:04,902
Thank you. Yep. Thank you.

1157
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:08,436
I remember taking a step
and looking down,

1158
01:10:08,436 --> 01:10:11,768
just as I'm thinking, "There's that ditch
Abbie was talking about."

1159
01:10:11,835 --> 01:10:14,168
Bam! I'm in the fucking ditch, you know.

1160
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:15,435
What happened?

1161
01:10:15,635 --> 01:10:17,836
What, with Zoë, the cat?

1162
01:10:17,903 --> 01:10:18,903
Nothing.

1163
01:10:19,036 --> 01:10:22,768
If I fell in that fuckin' thing, they would
have had to helicopter me out of there.

1164
01:10:22,902 --> 01:10:25,035
Zoë just lands on her feet.

1165
01:10:25,168 --> 01:10:29,102
But then later I started feeling
a little bad about myself...

1166
01:10:29,168 --> 01:10:33,968
Zoë falls in the ditch and it's nothing.
We're laughing about it.

1167
01:10:34,102 --> 01:10:38,234
If I fell in that fucking thing,
I probably would have been paralyzed.

1168
01:10:38,367 --> 01:10:40,635
Oh, honey, you can't think like that.

1169
01:10:40,635 --> 01:10:44,235
We all have our individual talents,
and that just happens to be one of Zoë's.

1170
01:10:44,302 --> 01:10:48,635
Well, physically speaking,
Zoë is amazing.

1171
01:10:48,702 --> 01:10:51,235
I mean, agility, reflexes, nimbleness?

1172
01:10:52,034 --> 01:10:55,102
There's few human beings that can fuck
with Zoë on that front.

1173
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:57,101
Kim, I like you too.

1174
01:10:58,034 --> 01:11:02,301
Having said that, before you get
too envious of Zoë's prowess,

1175
01:11:02,367 --> 01:11:04,901
you 're missing the most
important part of that story.

1176
01:11:04,967 --> 01:11:08,434
You didn't fall in the ditch.
Zoë did.

1177
01:11:08,434 --> 01:11:12,168
Zoë even knew there was a ditch there
because you told her,

1178
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:14,101
and she still fell in.

1179
01:11:14,167 --> 01:11:17,167
So Lee's right.
We all have our talents.

1180
01:11:17,234 --> 01:11:20,168
Hey, I resemble that remark.

1181
01:11:23,301 --> 01:11:25,301
So Kim, you still pack a Roscoe?

1182
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,166
Check it out, bitch.

1183
01:11:30,233 --> 01:11:32,567
- Ooh, nice one, mate.
- I know this.

1184
01:11:32,567 --> 01:11:33,767
What's a Roscoe?

1185
01:11:33,767 --> 01:11:35,034
Roscoe's a pistol.

1186
01:11:35,834 --> 01:11:37,767
- You carry a gun?
- Uh-huh.

1187
01:11:37,834 --> 01:11:39,700
You have a license to carry?

1188
01:11:39,833 --> 01:11:43,500
Yeah, when I became a Secret Service
agent, they gave me a license.

1189
01:11:44,234 --> 01:11:45,967
Oh, I didn't know you were...

1190
01:11:48,634 --> 01:11:52,501
Okay, I didn't say it, all right?
Stop looking at me. God.

1191
01:11:53,567 --> 01:11:55,433
Did you know Kim carried a gun?

1192
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:59,433
Yes. Now, do I approve? No.

1193
01:11:59,433 --> 01:12:01,433
Do I know? Yes.

1194
01:12:01,433 --> 01:12:05,033
Look, I don't know what
futuristic utopia you live in,

1195
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:07,833
but the world I live in,
a bitch need a gun.

1196
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:11,233
You can't get around the fact
that people who carry guns

1197
01:12:11,433 --> 01:12:13,967
tend to get shot
more than people who don't.

1198
01:12:14,034 --> 01:12:17,633
And you can't get around the fact
that if I go down to the laundry room

1199
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:20,633
at midnight enough times,
I might get my ass raped.

1200
01:12:20,633 --> 01:12:22,301
Don't do your laundry at midnight.

1201
01:12:22,367 --> 01:12:25,900
Fuck that! I wanna do my laundry
whenever the fuck I want to.

1202
01:12:25,966 --> 01:12:30,033
There are other things you can carry
other than a gun. Pepper spray.

1203
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:34,433
Uh, motherfucker trying to rape me,
I don't want to give him a skin rash.

1204
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:36,166
I wanna shut that nigga down!

1205
01:12:38,033 --> 01:12:40,100
How about a knife, at least?

1206
01:12:40,166 --> 01:12:42,565
Yeah, you know what happens
to motherfuckers carry knives?

1207
01:12:44,433 --> 01:12:46,165
They get shot!

1208
01:12:46,165 --> 01:12:50,100
If I ever become a famous actress,
I won't carry a gun.

1209
01:12:50,166 --> 01:12:53,700
I'll hire me a do-dirt nigga and he'll
carry the gun, and when shit goes down,

1210
01:12:53,766 --> 01:12:57,032
I'll sit back and laugh,
but until that day, it's Wild West.

1211
01:12:57,032 --> 01:13:00,500
So Zoë, you thought about
what you want to do first?

1212
01:13:02,165 --> 01:13:05,565
It just so happens
I know exactly what I want to do.

1213
01:13:05,699 --> 01:13:09,032
Oh, really?
And what would that be?

1214
01:13:09,032 --> 01:13:13,565
To me, there's no point in being in America
unless you can drive a Detroit muscle car.

1215
01:13:13,565 --> 01:13:17,765
I wanna drive a Dodge Challenger...
fuck me swinging, balls out.

1216
01:13:20,632 --> 01:13:23,032
Well, I guess we
could talk to Transpo,

1217
01:13:23,099 --> 01:13:25,433
but does it have to be
a Dodge Challenger?

1218
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:29,832
Not just that. It has to be a 1970
Dodge Challenger with a 440 engine.

1219
01:13:33,564 --> 01:13:36,632
How in the fuck
do you expect to do that?

1220
01:13:36,699 --> 01:13:37,965
No worries, mate.

1221
01:13:38,032 --> 01:13:40,099
I've got it all worked out.

1222
01:13:40,232 --> 01:13:43,298
When I knew I was coming here,
I went online and found out

1223
01:13:43,364 --> 01:13:46,699
<i>that the local paper here in Tennessee
is the Lebanon News Sentinel.</i>

1224
01:13:46,832 --> 01:13:49,365
- So back home...
- I'm sorry, where's home? Australia?

1225
01:13:51,899 --> 01:13:54,032
What do you mean by that, mate?

1226
01:13:54,032 --> 01:13:56,965
Zoë's from New Zealand,
and you never...

1227
01:13:57,032 --> 01:14:00,431
I repeat, never...
call a Kiwi an Aussie.

1228
01:14:00,431 --> 01:14:02,965
That is, unless
you want your ass kicked.

1229
01:14:04,898 --> 01:14:06,564
I'm so sorry. I will nev...

1230
01:14:07,764 --> 01:14:09,231
Oh, it's okay.

1231
01:14:09,298 --> 01:14:12,231
We're just taking the piss
out of you, mate.

1232
01:14:12,231 --> 01:14:15,431
Auckland, to answer your question.

1233
01:14:15,431 --> 01:14:18,432
Anyway, I subscribed
to the local paper a month ago.

1234
01:14:18,499 --> 01:14:21,898
Why the fuck you want a local redneck
newspaper in New Zealand?

1235
01:14:21,964 --> 01:14:24,298
Pipe down and I'll tell you.

1236
01:14:24,364 --> 01:14:27,165
I've been getting the paper
and checking the classifieds,

1237
01:14:27,299 --> 01:14:28,765
looking at cars for sale,

1238
01:14:28,899 --> 01:14:33,431
so as of yesterday,
for sale in this town,

1239
01:14:33,431 --> 01:14:36,630
some dude is selling
a stock 1970 Dodge Challenger

1240
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:40,231
with a 440 engine and a white paint job.

1241
01:14:40,298 --> 01:14:41,964
And you wanna buy it?

1242
01:14:43,231 --> 01:14:46,763
Kim, I may be stupid,
but I'm not bloody stupid.

1243
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:50,697
I wanna say I wanna buy it
so he'll let me test-drive it.

1244
01:14:50,763 --> 01:14:53,831
A 1970 Dodge Challenger
with a white paint job?

1245
01:14:53,898 --> 01:14:55,231
Oh, uh, Kowalski!

1246
01:14:55,431 --> 01:14:59,031
<i>Kowalski from Vanishing Point.
Mate, it's a fucking classic!</i>

1247
01:14:59,098 --> 01:15:00,431
If I can get this guy

1248
01:15:00,498 --> 01:15:04,298
to let me drive it without him,
I will blow the doors off that bitch.

1249
01:15:04,298 --> 01:15:06,097
<i>What's Vanishing Point?</i>

1250
01:15:07,230 --> 01:15:09,097
<i>What's Vanishing Point?</i>

1251
01:15:09,097 --> 01:15:12,030
Abs, I'm supposed
to be the illiterate one.

1252
01:15:12,030 --> 01:15:14,830
It's just one of the best
American movies ever made.

1253
01:15:14,963 --> 01:15:18,430
<i>Actually, Zoë, most girls
wouldn't know Vanishing Point.</i>

1254
01:15:19,364 --> 01:15:23,230
Excuse me. Most girls?
What the fuck are you two?

1255
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:26,563
Yeah, well, we're gearheads.
Of course we watched it.

1256
01:15:26,830 --> 01:15:28,964
<i>Y'all grew up watching
that Pretty in Pink shit.</i>

1257
01:15:28,964 --> 01:15:31,298
<i>Oh, I liked Pretty in Pink.</i>

1258
01:15:31,364 --> 01:15:33,697
What, so you didn't watch
John Hughes movies?

1259
01:15:33,763 --> 01:15:37,629
Of course I did. I'm a girl.
But I also watched car shit, too...

1260
01:15:37,696 --> 01:15:40,229
<i>Vanishing Point. Dirty Mary Crazy Larry.</i>

1261
01:15:40,296 --> 01:15:41,830
<i>- Gone in 60 Seconds...
- Oh...</i>

1262
01:15:41,897 --> 01:15:44,763
The real one, not that
Angelina Jolie bullshit.

1263
01:15:44,763 --> 01:15:48,362
<i>We have an outdoor theater in Auckland
that plays Vanishing Point.</i>

1264
01:15:48,496 --> 01:15:51,030
<i>Big Wednesday. all the classics.</i>

1265
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:08,762
What do you horny gals want?

1266
01:16:12,296 --> 01:16:15,429
Yeah, you got
a 1970 Dodge Challenger for sale?

1267
01:16:15,496 --> 01:16:16,829
Right up here, ladies.

1268
01:16:30,897 --> 01:16:33,897
This shit is off the fuckin' hook!

1269
01:16:33,897 --> 01:16:36,229
Fuckin' legendary, mate.

1270
01:16:38,429 --> 01:16:43,629
Sweet ass. Well, if you 'll excuse me,
I'd like to have a word with my associate.

1271
01:16:43,629 --> 01:16:44,962
You ladies take your time.

1272
01:16:51,628 --> 01:16:54,496
What are you waiting for?
Ask him to let you drive it by yourself.

1273
01:16:54,629 --> 01:16:57,029
I intend to, but first I need
to ask you something.

1274
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:58,229
What?

1275
01:16:58,229 --> 01:17:02,629
If he lets us take it out on our own,
I wanna play Ship's Mast.

1276
01:17:03,362 --> 01:17:05,029
- Oh, hell, no!
- Keep it down!

1277
01:17:05,029 --> 01:17:06,895
Ain't no way I'm doing Ship's Mast.

1278
01:17:07,028 --> 01:17:08,095
- For Chrissakes...
- Don't blaspheme.

1279
01:17:08,229 --> 01:17:09,162
Sorry.

1280
01:17:09,162 --> 01:17:11,828
Now, what did you say
after the last time?

1281
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:15,028
- Look, I know what I said.
- What did you say?

1282
01:17:15,161 --> 01:17:17,161
- I know I said we shouldn't...
- No.

1283
01:17:17,161 --> 01:17:20,228
You didn't say we shouldn't.
You said we ain't ever gonna do that again.

1284
01:17:20,228 --> 01:17:21,828
- But...
- But, my ass!

1285
01:17:21,895 --> 01:17:24,762
You said not only are we never
gonna play Ship's Mast again,

1286
01:17:25,029 --> 01:17:27,828
but you also said if you ever do
what you trying to do now,

1287
01:17:27,895 --> 01:17:32,628
to not only refuse, but that I had permission
to physically restrain your ass if necessary.

1288
01:17:32,695 --> 01:17:35,229
Now, did you or did you not say that?

1289
01:17:35,229 --> 01:17:38,428
No, no, no.
Answer the question, motherfucker.

1290
01:17:38,495 --> 01:17:41,761
- Did you or did you not say that?
- Yes, I said that.

1291
01:17:41,895 --> 01:17:43,694
- However...
- Whatever with your "however."

1292
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:47,628
Look, I know I said it,
and I know I meant it...

1293
01:17:47,628 --> 01:17:48,828
Damn skippy you meant it!

1294
01:17:48,895 --> 01:17:51,495
<i>But when I said it,
I didn't mean in America!</i>

1295
01:17:51,561 --> 01:17:53,494
- Oh, nigga, please.
- For real. Really.

1296
01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:57,361
I meant we should never play Ship's Mast
again in New Zealand or Australia.

1297
01:17:57,561 --> 01:17:59,228
You are such a liar!

1298
01:17:59,228 --> 01:18:04,561
I know what I said, but when I said it
I didn't know I'd ever come to America,

1299
01:18:04,561 --> 01:18:08,027
and if I had of known
I was gonna come to America,

1300
01:18:08,027 --> 01:18:11,428
<i>had the opportunity to play Ship's Mast
on the Vanishing Point Challenger...</i>

1301
01:18:11,428 --> 01:18:13,627
I would have added a "however."

1302
01:18:14,227 --> 01:18:15,294
Right?

1303
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,694
Okay, oddly enough,
I actually understood that.

1304
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:27,428
However, just because
you talked yourself into some stupid shit

1305
01:18:27,495 --> 01:18:29,560
doesn't mean I have lost
my goddamn mind.

1306
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:32,760
You need two people to play Ship's Mast,
and I ain't playing.

1307
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:41,960
I'll be your best friend.

1308
01:18:42,027 --> 01:18:44,826
I don't need me no best friend
lives on the other side of Planet Earth.

1309
01:18:45,026 --> 01:18:46,226
I'll crack your back.

1310
01:18:46,226 --> 01:18:47,626
You 'll crack it anyway.

1311
01:18:47,826 --> 01:18:50,360
Well, of course I'll crack it anyway.

1312
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:53,894
But now, while I'm here,
I'll be your back-cracking slave.

1313
01:18:54,027 --> 01:18:56,626
Whenever you want it, you 've got it.
You don't even have to ask.

1314
01:18:56,626 --> 01:18:59,960
You just order me to do it, just be like,
"Bitch, get over here and get busy."

1315
01:19:06,827 --> 01:19:11,159
You crack my back, give me foot massages,
and after a shower, you moisturize my butt.

1316
01:19:12,359 --> 01:19:13,294
Deal.

1317
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:17,693
We're gonna see if this guy'll let us
take the car out without him.

1318
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:20,626
If he does, you wait here with Lee
and we'll be back in a moment.

1319
01:19:21,226 --> 01:19:22,159
What?

1320
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:26,493
- I said we're gonna see if this guy'll let...
- I heard what you said.

1321
01:19:26,559 --> 01:19:29,760
I just can't believe
what you said.

1322
01:19:31,027 --> 01:19:32,826
You two got some fuckin' balls.

1323
01:19:32,893 --> 01:19:34,159
What?

1324
01:19:34,226 --> 01:19:35,759
Don't play dumbass with me.

1325
01:19:35,826 --> 01:19:40,627
I've been up all night, I'm still a little drunk,
and I have a hangover.

1326
01:19:40,627 --> 01:19:44,226
I should be in my hotel room, asleep,
not fuckin' around on Tobacco Road,

1327
01:19:44,293 --> 01:19:47,958
<i>but because Zoë wanted to drive
some Vanishing Point car, I'm here.</i>

1328
01:19:47,958 --> 01:19:51,826
Now you two got the balls to ask me...
no, scratch that... tell me

1329
01:19:51,826 --> 01:19:56,226
I gotta go make conversation with Tom Joad
while the cool kids get to go out and play?

1330
01:19:56,226 --> 01:19:57,958
Bullshit on that.

1331
01:19:58,025 --> 01:19:59,959
- It ain't like that.
- What's it like, Kim?

1332
01:20:00,026 --> 01:20:03,826
You guys are our collateral.
He's never gonna go for it if we all go.

1333
01:20:03,826 --> 01:20:07,426
I really think one human being
will be collateral enough.

1334
01:20:08,226 --> 01:20:10,026
You 're not gonna
want to do what we're doing.

1335
01:20:10,026 --> 01:20:11,426
What, drive a car?

1336
01:20:12,359 --> 01:20:13,492
We're doing more than that.

1337
01:20:13,558 --> 01:20:15,158
What, drive it fast?

1338
01:20:16,426 --> 01:20:18,092
We're doing more than that.

1339
01:20:18,225 --> 01:20:22,492
Actually, we're paying you a compliment,
'cause we gonna do some stupid shit.

1340
01:20:24,358 --> 01:20:26,825
But that's okay. We're stunt people.
We ain't got good sense.

1341
01:20:26,892 --> 01:20:29,225
But you got good sense,
and anybody with good sense

1342
01:20:29,292 --> 01:20:32,159
- ain't gonna want to do what we're doing.
- How do you know?

1343
01:20:32,159 --> 01:20:34,158
'Cause you 're a mum.

1344
01:20:34,292 --> 01:20:35,558
Yeah.

1345
01:20:38,025 --> 01:20:40,826
You know, we're supposed
to be this big posse,

1346
01:20:40,826 --> 01:20:44,558
but that's the excuse you guys use
whenever you want to exclude me,

1347
01:20:44,625 --> 01:20:47,358
so what is it you two daredevils are doing

1348
01:20:47,625 --> 01:20:51,624
that I'm just so uncool
I couldn't possibly understand?

1349
01:20:51,691 --> 01:20:53,825
You know, we're kind of conning this guy,

1350
01:20:54,025 --> 01:20:57,425
so maybe it's best if we don't go
into detail about it while he's watching us.

1351
01:20:57,625 --> 01:20:58,625
Besides...

1352
01:20:59,824 --> 01:21:02,292
he's probably not gonna
let us do it, anyway.

1353
01:21:05,091 --> 01:21:08,092
Okay, how about this?

1354
01:21:08,758 --> 01:21:11,825
I'll talk him into it,
but I go along.

1355
01:21:13,025 --> 01:21:15,624
- How you gonna do that?
- That's my problem.

1356
01:21:16,357 --> 01:21:17,557
But don't worry.

1357
01:21:18,358 --> 01:21:20,357
He'll say yes.

1358
01:21:20,357 --> 01:21:22,424
What are you gonna do, blow him?

1359
01:21:22,624 --> 01:21:23,557
No.

1360
01:21:25,024 --> 01:21:27,424
I'm gonna insinuate
that Lee's gonna blow him.

1361
01:21:31,424 --> 01:21:33,024
That's a good one.

1362
01:21:33,091 --> 01:21:34,358
Not really.

1363
01:21:35,425 --> 01:21:38,491
But let me handle it.
We got a deal?

1364
01:21:42,692 --> 01:21:44,025
Okay, Mama, listen up.

1365
01:21:44,092 --> 01:21:47,691
You wanna hang with the cool kids?
You got to be cool.

1366
01:21:47,757 --> 01:21:50,491
We take you along, you don't say shit.
You don't even say crap.

1367
01:21:50,557 --> 01:21:53,490
You just sit in the back, and I don't want
to hear a peep, you understand?

1368
01:21:53,556 --> 01:21:54,823
- Got it.
- I'm serious, now.

1369
01:21:54,956 --> 01:21:58,557
You start nagging us, we pulling over,
kicking you out, and picking you up later.

1370
01:21:58,824 --> 01:22:00,024
Agreed.

1371
01:22:03,823 --> 01:22:06,824
Okay. Go work your magic.

1372
01:22:13,024 --> 01:22:14,624
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

1373
01:22:14,624 --> 01:22:16,224
- Hello, what's your name?
- Jasper.

1374
01:22:16,224 --> 01:22:17,823
Hello, Jasper, I'm Abernathy.

1375
01:22:18,023 --> 01:22:19,490
- Aber what?
- Abernathy.

1376
01:22:19,623 --> 01:22:21,891
- What's your first name?
- That is my first name.

1377
01:22:21,957 --> 01:22:25,156
- What kind of first name is that?
- Just call me Abbie.

1378
01:22:25,290 --> 01:22:26,756
Okay, Abbie.

1379
01:22:27,823 --> 01:22:31,356
Jasper, we were wondering
if my friends and I could take the car out

1380
01:22:31,423 --> 01:22:34,356
for a little test drive out on our own,
just to see if we're comfortable.

1381
01:22:34,356 --> 01:22:36,157
Why would I do something
stupid like that?

1382
01:22:36,157 --> 01:22:38,356
To better sell your automobile.

1383
01:22:38,423 --> 01:22:40,623
How do I know y'all ain't
just gonna steal it?

1384
01:22:40,623 --> 01:22:42,623
Four reasons, actually.

1385
01:22:42,623 --> 01:22:47,091
One, we're not thieves,
two, that would be rude,

1386
01:22:47,157 --> 01:22:49,623
three, we're staying
at the Days Inn in town...

1387
01:22:49,823 --> 01:22:53,156
you can call, check with management.
We're registered for the next month.

1388
01:22:53,223 --> 01:22:57,823
Actually, Zoë's not, but Kim and I are,
so we're totally track-downable.

1389
01:22:57,890 --> 01:22:59,490
Who's Kim? The colored girl?

1390
01:23:00,290 --> 01:23:03,690
Yes. Kim would be the girl of color.

1391
01:23:03,756 --> 01:23:06,089
And reason number four...
and the most important:

1392
01:23:06,155 --> 01:23:08,956
while we're taking the car out
for a little spin,

1393
01:23:09,090 --> 01:23:13,290
that'll give you a better opportunity
to get acquainted with our other friend...

1394
01:23:14,156 --> 01:23:15,223
Lee.

1395
01:23:18,423 --> 01:23:20,422
Why does she look
kind of familiar?

1396
01:23:20,489 --> 01:23:23,356
That would be because
she's a famous actress.

1397
01:23:23,423 --> 01:23:24,423
Hmm.

1398
01:23:25,355 --> 01:23:26,822
Why's she dressed like that?

1399
01:23:26,889 --> 01:23:29,822
Well, you see, we're making
a Hollywood movie in town,

1400
01:23:29,822 --> 01:23:32,822
and it's a cheerleader movie,
and she's one of the cheerleaders.

1401
01:23:32,822 --> 01:23:34,422
What's a cheerleader movie?

1402
01:23:34,489 --> 01:23:36,222
A movie about cheerleaders.

1403
01:23:37,422 --> 01:23:38,556
Is it a porno movie?

1404
01:23:40,223 --> 01:23:46,622
Yes, it is, but don't mention it. She's shy.

1405
01:23:50,090 --> 01:23:52,622
Lee, this is Jasper.
Jasper, Lee.

1406
01:23:52,755 --> 01:23:55,355
Now, you two kids
stay out of trouble.

1407
01:23:55,422 --> 01:23:58,288
Hey, good-looking.
Be back to pick you up later.

1408
01:23:58,354 --> 01:23:59,554
Ta-ta!

1409
01:24:09,555 --> 01:24:10,822
Gulp.

1410
01:24:24,889 --> 01:24:26,289
You thinking what I'm thinking?

1411
01:24:27,888 --> 01:24:29,221
I think I'm thinking it.

1412
01:24:29,221 --> 01:24:30,688
What are you and you thinking?

1413
01:24:30,821 --> 01:24:34,021
I'm thinking we told your ass
to shut the fuck up.

1414
01:24:36,554 --> 01:24:38,554
- Where y'all going?
- You stay put.

1415
01:24:38,554 --> 01:24:40,021
I gotta take a...

1416
01:24:56,488 --> 01:24:58,221
So, you ready to do this?

1417
01:24:59,687 --> 01:25:00,687
You sure?

1418
01:25:00,820 --> 01:25:05,288
Well, I always don't want to do it
right before I'm gonna do it.

1419
01:25:05,354 --> 01:25:07,688
I know what you mean,
'cause I don't wanna do it.

1420
01:25:07,754 --> 01:25:08,754
Kim!

1421
01:25:08,888 --> 01:25:11,420
- I'm just saying.
- If you 're gonna take the piss out of it...

1422
01:25:11,487 --> 01:25:13,088
I'm just saying.

1423
01:25:14,420 --> 01:25:16,021
You wanna start out on top?

1424
01:25:17,421 --> 01:25:20,621
Practically doesn't count
if you start on the top.

1425
01:25:25,887 --> 01:25:27,020
Here are your gloves.

1426
01:25:33,887 --> 01:25:36,353
No, no, no, no.
I'm wearing a jacket.

1427
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:38,087
This is my jacket.

1428
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:41,287
Um, ain't you supposed to be
my slave or some shit?

1429
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:45,487
- Come on.
- I'm the one who's on the bonnet.

1430
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:47,953
Bonnet, my ass.
You on the hood.

1431
01:25:56,887 --> 01:25:59,220
Y'all, I think I hear a car coming.

1432
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:00,420
Give me your belt.

1433
01:26:04,552 --> 01:26:09,687
This is my cute shit.
Fuck that. Get Abernathy's belt.

1434
01:26:11,419 --> 01:26:13,219
Fine, we'll use Abbie's belt.

1435
01:26:18,287 --> 01:26:21,020
- Give me your belt.
- No. Prada.

1436
01:26:21,087 --> 01:26:22,620
Come on, give her the belt.

1437
01:26:22,687 --> 01:26:26,287
- Magic word.
- Please give her the belt?

1438
01:26:27,286 --> 01:26:28,686
Just 'cause you asked nicely.

1439
01:26:31,353 --> 01:26:33,152
It's nice to be nice, Kim!

1440
01:26:33,152 --> 01:26:35,019
Whatever.

1441
01:26:35,019 --> 01:26:39,219
You know what?
Don't think about asking me to do your hair.

1442
01:26:39,419 --> 01:26:41,619
- Your ass gonna do it.
- You 'll ask "pretty please," bitch,

1443
01:26:41,819 --> 01:26:44,419
because that's what you do when no one
else is looking. You ain't that hard.

1444
01:26:44,619 --> 01:26:46,353
- I ain't getting...
- Abernathy.

1445
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:48,352
Don't get on my nerves right now.

1446
01:26:48,419 --> 01:26:50,752
- I got shit on my mind.
Ooh!

1447
01:26:50,819 --> 01:26:52,819
You know, I ain't six.

1448
01:27:05,218 --> 01:27:07,552
It's cold. Can we roll up
one of these windows?

1449
01:27:07,619 --> 01:27:08,752
KIM and ZOË: No.

1450
01:27:10,152 --> 01:27:12,819
Okay, Abernathy. Check this out.

1451
01:27:24,152 --> 01:27:25,752
What the fuck are you guys doing?

1452
01:27:34,618 --> 01:27:36,018
What does that mean?

1453
01:27:38,018 --> 01:27:40,418
Whoa!

1454
01:27:44,151 --> 01:27:47,418
Faster, you black bitch! Faster!

1455
01:27:54,351 --> 01:27:56,618
That fast enough for your bony ass?

1456
01:27:56,618 --> 01:27:58,352
Whoo-hoo!

1457
01:27:58,352 --> 01:28:00,818
Whoa ho ho ho!

1458
01:28:01,018 --> 01:28:01,818
Oh!

1459
01:28:04,218 --> 01:28:06,617
Abernathy, get your ass up here.

1460
01:28:11,018 --> 01:28:14,018
Whoa! Whoo-hoo!

1461
01:28:14,018 --> 01:28:15,618
Alrighty.

1462
01:28:15,618 --> 01:28:17,684
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1463
01:28:29,751 --> 01:28:31,151
Go, go! Go!

1464
01:28:31,218 --> 01:28:33,750
Check it out, bitch.
You want it fucking faster?

1465
01:28:47,617 --> 01:28:48,617
Whoo-hoo!

1466
01:28:48,817 --> 01:28:50,618
Yah hoo hoo!

1467
01:28:50,818 --> 01:28:51,751
##

1468
01:28:59,351 --> 01:29:01,418
Yah hoo hoo!

1469
01:29:46,149 --> 01:29:49,749
- Oh, my God.
- What the fuck? Shit.

1470
01:29:55,749 --> 01:29:56,416
Damn it!

1471
01:30:05,217 --> 01:30:06,149
Now.

1472
01:30:07,416 --> 01:30:09,683
Did you do something to him?
Say something?

1473
01:30:09,749 --> 01:30:11,815
Nothing! Shit.

1474
01:30:11,815 --> 01:30:13,682
Here he comes, Zoë.
He's coming!

1475
01:30:13,748 --> 01:30:14,816
Aah!

1476
01:30:16,949 --> 01:30:18,083
Shit, oh shit!

1477
01:30:18,216 --> 01:30:19,483
No!

1478
01:30:20,416 --> 01:30:21,682
Hold on, Zoë!

1479
01:30:30,549 --> 01:30:32,349
Oh, my God. Zoë!

1480
01:30:32,616 --> 01:30:34,749
- Oh! Hold on!
- I can't!

1481
01:30:38,348 --> 01:30:40,016
Fuck you, motherfucker!

1482
01:30:41,815 --> 01:30:45,015
Zoë! Zoë!

1483
01:30:45,015 --> 01:30:48,215
- I'm sorry I called you a black bitch!
- I forgive you. Hold the fuck on!

1484
01:30:48,282 --> 01:30:50,348
Whoa, whoa, get away!

1485
01:30:52,615 --> 01:30:55,149
Oh, shit.
I can't see. I can't see!

1486
01:30:55,216 --> 01:30:56,416
Zoë, move your leg!

1487
01:31:00,082 --> 01:31:01,948
Oh! Come on, come on!

1488
01:31:05,349 --> 01:31:08,748
Redneck lunatic bastard!
Get away from me!

1489
01:31:08,815 --> 01:31:09,748
fucking legs!

1490
01:31:14,147 --> 01:31:16,081
Oh, my God.

1491
01:31:26,015 --> 01:31:28,614
Shit, I'm scared, Kim.
I'm really scared.

1492
01:31:28,814 --> 01:31:30,148
I know, baby, just hold on.

1493
01:31:30,148 --> 01:31:32,015
Watch your feet!

1494
01:31:34,415 --> 01:31:35,415
You wanna get hot?

1495
01:31:35,615 --> 01:31:37,415
- Fucking son of a bitch!
- You wanna get hot?

1496
01:31:38,548 --> 01:31:40,747
Then suck on this for a while, bitch!

1497
01:31:43,815 --> 01:31:46,081
Zoë! Goddamn it!

1498
01:32:11,014 --> 01:32:13,547
Oh, my God. Get away from us,
you cocksucker!

1499
01:32:13,614 --> 01:32:15,081
Leave us alone!

1500
01:32:15,213 --> 01:32:18,280
Fuck you, motherfucker!
Fuck you!

1501
01:32:22,414 --> 01:32:25,214
Zoë! Zoë! Oh, Zoë!

1502
01:32:26,413 --> 01:32:28,013
Hold on!

1503
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,546
Zoë! Zoë!

1504
01:32:58,413 --> 01:32:59,414
Look out!

1505
01:33:26,746 --> 01:33:29,412
Get ready to fly, bitch.

1506
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:34,680
- Zoë!
- Zoë, hold on!

1507
01:33:41,346 --> 01:33:43,213
He's right on your fucking ass!

1508
01:33:58,412 --> 01:34:00,012
Hey! Whoo-hoo!

1509
01:34:00,812 --> 01:34:04,479
Hey, ladies, that was fun.

1510
01:34:08,612 --> 01:34:11,012
<i>Well, adios.</i>

1511
01:34:11,012 --> 01:34:13,280
Ow! Fuck!

1512
01:34:14,613 --> 01:34:16,079
Shit! Fuck!

1513
01:34:17,745 --> 01:34:20,211
Run away with your ass!

1514
01:34:21,278 --> 01:34:23,344
You better run, motherfucker!

1515
01:34:28,612 --> 01:34:30,212
That bitch!

1516
01:34:45,412 --> 01:34:46,611
I'm okay!

1517
01:34:46,611 --> 01:34:49,612
Oh, shit! Goddamn it!

1518
01:34:49,612 --> 01:34:52,211
Oh, you fuckin' bitch!

1519
01:34:52,278 --> 01:34:55,811
Of course you are.
Of course you are. What was I thinking?

1520
01:34:57,078 --> 01:35:00,011
What was I thinking?
Zoë, the fucking cat!

1521
01:35:03,944 --> 01:35:05,745
Whew. That was a close one.

1522
01:35:09,078 --> 01:35:11,678
So, where's the maniac?

1523
01:35:11,744 --> 01:35:14,479
I shot him and his punk ass sped off.

1524
01:35:15,612 --> 01:35:17,744
You wanna go get him?

1525
01:35:17,744 --> 01:35:19,744
Oh, hell yeah!

1526
01:35:19,744 --> 01:35:20,811
Honey...

1527
01:35:21,611 --> 01:35:23,610
I think you might want to get out.

1528
01:35:24,543 --> 01:35:26,011
Fuck that shit.

1529
01:35:27,211 --> 01:35:28,944
Let's kill this bastard.

1530
01:35:30,878 --> 01:35:33,210
Okay, get your ass in the back.
Let's go.

1531
01:35:39,078 --> 01:35:40,544
Where the fuck you going?

1532
01:35:40,611 --> 01:35:41,478
I'll be back!

1533
01:35:49,543 --> 01:35:52,144
This'll smart. Sweet. Let's go.

1534
01:35:52,211 --> 01:35:55,810
Oh, fuck yeah, bitch.
Come on. Bring that shit.

1535
01:35:57,877 --> 01:35:59,143
Giddy-up, then!

1536
01:36:07,078 --> 01:36:08,411
Yeah!

1537
01:36:38,410 --> 01:36:39,610
