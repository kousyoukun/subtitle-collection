1
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,887
Hold on, I gotta come up!

2
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,222
I've gotta take
the world's biggest fucking piss.

3
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:02,141
We can't be late!

4
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:03,809
We won't!

5
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,751
Who's... who's holding?

6
00:03:28,793 --> 00:03:30,419
If you 're not, then nobody.

7
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:32,255
We were kind of hoping you were.

8
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:34,799
- Yeah. How are you not holding?
- Jesus Christ, Shanna.

9
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:37,969
It is not my fucking job to supply y'all
with weed when we go out.

10
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:40,263
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, little lady.

11
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,306
You 're gettin' angry kind of quick,
don't you think?

12
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,599
I was just teasin' you!

13
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:45,101
I'm not angry.
It just would be nice

14
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,895
if y'all didn't just count on me
all the fucking time

15
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:50,815
and surprise me
every once in a while with pot.

16
00:03:50,857 --> 00:03:52,817
Okay, mean girl
in a high school movie.

17
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,277
Are you through
having a tantrum?

18
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:55,528
I'm not having a tantrum.

19
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:57,864
Yes, you are. You 've been
in the car all of two seconds,

20
00:03:57,947 --> 00:03:59,115
and you 're already cursing at me.

21
00:03:59,157 --> 00:04:00,950
I am not cursing at you.

22
00:04:00,992 --> 00:04:05,121
You said "Jesus Christ, Shanna,"

23
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:06,664
and then before
the sentence was over

24
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,625
<i>you threw a "fucking" in there
to emphasize your irritatedness.</i>

25
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:12,003
Come on, don't fight.
I'll pay for it when we get some.

26
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:16,132
One, it is not about the money.
It is about the pain in the ass of scoring.

27
00:04:16,174 --> 00:04:18,342
And two, we're not really fighting.

28
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:22,096
Arlene, you 've forgotten what
hanging out with Jungle Julia is like.

29
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,389
That wasn't a fight.

30
00:04:23,473 --> 00:04:26,017
That was Julia
acting like a grumpy bitch

31
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,979
and me calling her on it
and indulging her at the same time.

32
00:04:30,021 --> 00:04:33,024
That's how we tolerate each other
after all these years.

33
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:34,108
Oh! Billboard!

34
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:40,448
So, what's the plan, man?

35
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,492
Margaritas and Mexican food at Guero's.

36
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,410
Did you call Rafael
and tell him we're coming?

37
00:04:44,494 --> 00:04:45,912
- Of course.
- You 're so good.

38
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:47,163
I know.

39
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:49,707
Okay, is Christian Simonson
gonna be there?

40
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,460
You bet your ass he is...
with Jesse Letterman.

41
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:55,546
Christian Simonson,
the filmmaker, is in town.

42
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,048
He's got a big thing for Julia.

43
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:59,384
If he had a big thing for me,
he'd fucking call me,

44
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,135
as opposed to disappearing
for six months,

45
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:03,471
and he'd get his ass down here
more often than he does.

46
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:06,266
And on my birthday
he'd give me a fucking phone call.

47
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:07,517
Oh, billboard!

48
00:05:14,983 --> 00:05:17,694
Yeah, but you get
those legs of yours around him,

49
00:05:17,777 --> 00:05:18,861
and it's all over.

50
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:22,490
Yeah, well, when I'm redecorating
his house in the hills that I am also living in,

51
00:05:22,574 --> 00:05:24,033
I'll let you know it worked.

52
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:26,661
So, margaritas
and Mexican food at Guero's,

53
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:28,705
touch base with Chris and Jesse,
tell them about later,

54
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:30,874
and make damn sure they come.

55
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:34,085
Those other guys'll be waiting for us
at the Texas Chili Parlor.

56
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:37,630
Oh, shit. Speaking of which...

57
00:05:37,714 --> 00:05:39,507
what happened
with you and Nate last night?

58
00:05:39,591 --> 00:05:42,260
Well, you know, not much.
We just fucking met each other.

59
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:45,180
If you don't bust their balls a little bit,
they're never gonna respect you.

60
00:05:45,263 --> 00:05:47,599
<i>Okay, we're pretty clear
on what it is you didn 't do.</i>

61
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:49,893
<i>How about enlightening us
on what it is you did do?</i>

62
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:51,978
Oh, nothing to write home about.

63
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:54,439
We just made out on the couch
for about 20 minutes.

64
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:56,024
Dressed, half-dressed, or naked?

65
00:05:56,107 --> 00:05:58,818
Dressed. I said we made out.
We didn't do "the thing."

66
00:05:58,902 --> 00:06:02,280
Oh, excuse me for living,
but what is "the thing"?

67
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:04,199
You know, it's everything but.

68
00:06:04,282 --> 00:06:05,992
They call that "the thing"?

69
00:06:06,076 --> 00:06:07,619
I call it "the thing."

70
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:09,662
Do guys like "the thing"?

71
00:06:09,746 --> 00:06:11,414
They like it better than "no thing."

72
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,710
<i>Okay, I wanna get back
to what it is you did do.</i>

73
00:06:15,794 --> 00:06:17,337
So you 're making out
on the couch with Nate, right?

74
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,380
Correct.

75
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:19,964
Whose couch?
His or the one in your hotel room?

76
00:06:20,048 --> 00:06:22,467
What am I, stupid over here? Mine.

77
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,594
Were you making out
sitting up or lying down?

78
00:06:24,636 --> 00:06:27,097
We started sitting up,
we worked our way to lying down.

79
00:06:27,138 --> 00:06:30,266
Hmm. The plot thickens.
Who was on top?

80
00:06:30,308 --> 00:06:32,143
I was straddling him.

81
00:06:32,978 --> 00:06:33,937
What else?

82
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,982
That was it. So we made out
for a little while on the couch...

83
00:06:37,065 --> 00:06:41,861
and I said, "Okay, I'm gonna go to bed now,
so it's time for you to leave."

84
00:06:41,945 --> 00:06:44,698
And then he starts to whine,
"Oh, right now?"

85
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:47,867
And I said,
"Yup, right now. Let's go."

86
00:06:47,951 --> 00:06:50,495
And he says, "Wait, what about this?"
And I said no.

87
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:52,497
He said, "What do you mean?
You don't know what I'm gonna say."

88
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,709
I said, "I already know what you 're
gonna say, and the answer's no."

89
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:57,460
He said, "Well, how can you say
you know what I'm gonna say?"

90
00:06:57,544 --> 00:07:00,088
And I said, "Because you 're gonna say,
'Let's just go to sleep together.

91
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:01,464
'We don't gotta do nothing.

92
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:03,592
'Just cuddle,
sleep next to each other,

93
00:07:03,675 --> 00:07:05,510
wake up in the morning together."'

94
00:07:05,594 --> 00:07:08,972
"No. You 're gonna leave...
but I'll see you tomorrow."

95
00:07:09,014 --> 00:07:10,307
Yeah, fuck Nate.

96
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:11,391
I mean, he's cute and all,

97
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:14,394
but Jesse Letterman
is gonna be all over her.

98
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:17,814
Remember...
no hookin' up tonight.

99
00:07:17,856 --> 00:07:21,443
You can hang out with them,
you can make out with them,

100
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:23,486
but no hookin' up with them,

101
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,907
because we are driving
to Lake L.B.J. tonight,

102
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,950
and my daddy's pretty clear
about one thing...

103
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:34,122
He said, "I am lettin' you
and your girlfriends stay at my lake house,

104
00:07:34,206 --> 00:07:38,335
not you and a bunch of horny boys
trying to get their fuck on with my daughter."

105
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:40,712
- Your dad talks like that?
- Hell yeah.

106
00:07:40,796 --> 00:07:43,048
And it's not like
he ain't gonna know, either,

107
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:46,760
because when I'm staying at the lake house
with my girlfriends in our bikinis,

108
00:07:46,843 --> 00:07:50,889
Daddy just has a tendency to pop up
and make sure we don't need anything.

109
00:07:52,307 --> 00:07:55,977
Look, he's totally harmless
and cute as a bug's ear!

110
00:07:56,061 --> 00:07:58,730
But you know, when he's got
a bunch of half-naked poontang

111
00:07:58,814 --> 00:08:01,108
walking the floor of his lake house,

112
00:08:01,191 --> 00:08:04,569
he just likes to pay us a visit
and make sure we got everything we need.

113
00:08:04,653 --> 00:08:06,196
And if you flirt shamelessly with him,

114
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,865
like the six-foot baby giraffe
in the backseat,

115
00:08:08,907 --> 00:08:10,951
you got a puppy dog for life.

116
00:08:11,034 --> 00:08:12,577
I have my own relationship with Ben,

117
00:08:12,661 --> 00:08:14,579
and you 're just jealous
'cause it don't include you.

118
00:08:14,621 --> 00:08:15,914
You call her dad "Ben"?

119
00:08:15,998 --> 00:08:18,333
I'm not a child.
That's his name.

120
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:20,377
So, when are the boys
showing up?

121
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:22,587
They're gonna meet us
at the Chili Parlor.

122
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:24,214
Maybe they can bring some pot.

123
00:08:24,256 --> 00:08:25,757
Fuck that. No.

124
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:28,093
I don't wanna be either A,
depending on their fucking ass,

125
00:08:28,176 --> 00:08:29,594
or B, depending on their ass.

126
00:08:29,678 --> 00:08:30,929
Uh-uh. If we don't score ourselves,

127
00:08:31,013 --> 00:08:33,640
we're gonna be stuck with them
all fucking night.

128
00:08:33,724 --> 00:08:35,851
Ooh! Try Lanna-Frank.

129
00:08:35,934 --> 00:08:37,603
Best idea you had all day.

130
00:08:37,686 --> 00:08:40,731
Oh, hey! That's your
last billboard before Guero's!

131
00:08:40,772 --> 00:08:42,774
Oh, come on, give me a break.

132
00:08:42,858 --> 00:08:45,444
Oh, come on, my ass!
We said every time.

133
00:08:45,527 --> 00:08:46,570
Okay.

134
00:08:53,493 --> 00:08:55,829
##

135
00:09:01,126 --> 00:09:02,794
Jules, let me get a drag.

136
00:09:02,878 --> 00:09:04,129
Thanks.

137
00:09:34,952 --> 00:09:35,911
Oh, my God.

138
00:09:36,328 --> 00:09:39,206
Hey, this is...
and I's U.T. days, Arlene.

139
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:40,249
Hey.

140
00:09:40,332 --> 00:09:42,960
- You wanna join us?
- For a second, but I'm with some friends.

141
00:09:43,585 --> 00:09:45,003
Ooh...

142
00:09:45,045 --> 00:09:47,214
So, you must be... must be...

143
00:09:47,297 --> 00:09:50,092
So, you must be
the infamous Butterfly.

144
00:09:50,175 --> 00:09:51,385
Shh!

145
00:09:51,468 --> 00:09:53,345
She don't know nothing about it.

146
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:55,264
- Know about what?
- When were y'all gonna tell her?

147
00:09:55,347 --> 00:09:56,432
<i>- Soon.
- Tell me what?</i>

148
00:09:56,515 --> 00:09:59,226
Yeah, now thanks to you,
we've gotta tell her sooner than later.

149
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:00,894
All right, cut the shit.
What the fuck is going on?

150
00:10:00,978 --> 00:10:03,647
I said a little something-something
about you on the air today.

151
00:10:03,689 --> 00:10:05,899
Julia, what the fuck
did you say about me on the radio?

152
00:10:05,983 --> 00:10:09,403
All I said was I had
a sexy friend named Butterfly

153
00:10:09,486 --> 00:10:11,488
who was in from out-of-town
for the weekend,

154
00:10:11,572 --> 00:10:14,199
and we would be going out
somewhere in Austin tonight,

155
00:10:14,283 --> 00:10:16,702
and if they were out on the town,
maybe they'd see us.

156
00:10:16,744 --> 00:10:21,332
And I described you, and I said
that if they spotted you while we were out,

157
00:10:21,415 --> 00:10:24,376
if they'd do something,
you 'd do something.

158
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,753
Okay, now, Julia, I'm serious.

159
00:10:25,836 --> 00:10:28,213
What did you say
and what did you say I'd do?

160
00:10:28,297 --> 00:10:32,217
Anywho, I could explain what I said,
which would be boring,

161
00:10:32,301 --> 00:10:34,970
or Marcy over here,

162
00:10:35,054 --> 00:10:37,598
who is an incredible actress,
could act it out for you,

163
00:10:37,681 --> 00:10:41,769
which I think will give you a better idea
what you have in store for you tonight.

164
00:10:41,852 --> 00:10:43,896
Okay, so just tell me your way.

165
00:10:43,979 --> 00:10:45,981
- So we'll act it out with Marcy?
- Sure.

166
00:10:46,065 --> 00:10:48,234
Okay, give Marcy your drink.

167
00:10:49,485 --> 00:10:52,947
Okay, so you 're
in a club or a bar,

168
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:56,075
and Marcy's a kind of cute
or kind of hot or kind of sexy

169
00:10:56,158 --> 00:10:57,868
or better be
fucking hysterically funny,

170
00:10:57,952 --> 00:11:00,704
<i>but not-funny-looking guy
who you could fuck.</i>

171
00:11:00,746 --> 00:11:01,997
Got it.

172
00:11:02,081 --> 00:11:03,833
Okay, Marcy, take it.

173
00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:13,926
Howdy.

174
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:16,303
Hi, there.

175
00:11:16,387 --> 00:11:19,056
Excuse me, but...

176
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,225
your name wouldn't be
"Butterfly," would it?

177
00:11:21,267 --> 00:11:25,187
Yes, it is, and it seems
you have me at a disadvantage.

178
00:11:25,271 --> 00:11:26,689
Barry.

179
00:11:26,772 --> 00:11:28,441
Pleased to meet you, Barry.

180
00:11:28,524 --> 00:11:29,984
<i>Y'all are gettin' me hot!</i>

181
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:31,193
Shh!

182
00:11:34,363 --> 00:11:38,534
So is, uh...
"Butterfly" your real name?

183
00:11:38,617 --> 00:11:40,327
Yes, it is.

184
00:11:40,411 --> 00:11:42,329
And how'd you know
my name, Barry?

185
00:11:42,413 --> 00:11:45,207
I listened to Jungle Julia's show
this mornin'.

186
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,417
Oh, you did, did you?

187
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:48,794
Oh, yeah, I listen to her show
every morning.

188
00:11:48,878 --> 00:11:50,921
Oh, you do, do you?

189
00:11:50,963 --> 00:11:53,966
Yeah, she's like
the coolest lady in town.

190
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,510
Don't you think
she's got a big ass?

191
00:11:56,594 --> 00:11:59,972
Nah, man!
I like her ass that way.

192
00:12:00,056 --> 00:12:02,016
She got a black girl's ass.

193
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:03,768
Well, that's what she always says,

194
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:06,687
but in actual fact, she doesn't
really have a black girl's ass.

195
00:12:06,771 --> 00:12:08,731
<i>She's got a big ass.</i>

196
00:12:08,814 --> 00:12:10,232
Okay, what the fuck
are you doing?

197
00:12:10,316 --> 00:12:12,151
Look who wants
to get to the point all of a sudden.

198
00:12:12,234 --> 00:12:13,444
Okay, we'll get to the point,

199
00:12:13,486 --> 00:12:15,404
but for your information,
skinny bitch,

200
00:12:15,488 --> 00:12:18,574
black men and a whole lot
of motherfuckin' white men

201
00:12:18,658 --> 00:12:21,202
have had plenty of fun
adoring my ass.

202
00:12:21,285 --> 00:12:24,413
I don't wear their teeth marks
on my butt for nothing.

203
00:12:24,497 --> 00:12:26,916
If you 're not gonna buy me a drink,
can I have mine back?

204
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:29,335
No, okay, okay, okay, okay.

205
00:12:29,418 --> 00:12:30,753
So, Butterfly...

206
00:12:30,836 --> 00:12:32,296
can I buy you a drink?

207
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,714
I'd love one.

208
00:12:33,798 --> 00:12:34,757
What can I get ya?

209
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,467
I'll take a margarita.

210
00:12:37,843 --> 00:12:38,970
Here ya go.

211
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:42,139
So, after they buy you a drink

212
00:12:42,181 --> 00:12:44,600
when they raise
their glass to toast,

213
00:12:44,684 --> 00:12:49,647
they look you dead in the eye
and repeat this poem...

214
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:54,110
"The woods are lovely,
dark and deep

215
00:12:54,193 --> 00:12:59,323
And I have promises to keep
and miles to go before I sleep."

216
00:12:59,407 --> 00:13:01,284
Did you hear me, Butterfly?

217
00:13:01,367 --> 00:13:04,328
"Miles to go before you sleep."

218
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:07,999
And then, if they say that...

219
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:10,668
you gotta give 'em a lap dance.

220
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:12,378
What?

221
00:13:12,462 --> 00:13:14,964
If they call you "Butterfly,"
buy you a drink, repeat that poem,

222
00:13:15,047 --> 00:13:16,007
you gotta give 'em a lap dance.

223
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,009
That's bullshit.
I ain't giving them nothin'.

224
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,677
Well, you can do it or not,
but if you don't,

225
00:13:19,761 --> 00:13:22,054
everybody in Austin
is gonna think you a chicken shit.

226
00:13:22,138 --> 00:13:23,681
And I don't think you want
everybody in Austin

227
00:13:23,723 --> 00:13:25,266
thinking you 're a chicken shit.

228
00:13:25,349 --> 00:13:27,518
I ain't giving nobody no lap dance
'cause of what you said.

229
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,604
Oh, come on!
It's gonna be funny!

230
00:13:29,687 --> 00:13:32,440
Yeah, everything's funny to you two
when it's happening to me.

231
00:13:32,523 --> 00:13:35,693
Look. You don't have to do it
for anybody you don't want.

232
00:13:35,777 --> 00:13:37,737
I said you 'd do it
for the first guy who says it.

233
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,865
So, some geek comes over
trying to be cool,

234
00:13:40,907 --> 00:13:43,826
just tell him you already did it
at another place earlier.

235
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:47,622
No harm, no foul,
but you get a free drink out of it.

236
00:13:47,705 --> 00:13:50,249
But maybe a little later
in the evening,

237
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,876
you 've had a few drinks,

238
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:54,128
you 're kind of loosey-goosey,

239
00:13:54,212 --> 00:13:56,005
you 're safe with your girls,

240
00:13:56,089 --> 00:13:58,800
then some kind of cute,
kind of hot, kind of sexy,

241
00:13:58,883 --> 00:14:02,679
hysterically funny, but not-funny-looking guy
comes up and says it...

242
00:14:02,762 --> 00:14:06,849
then maybe you did it earlier,
maybe you didn't.

243
00:14:12,355 --> 00:14:13,898
She's making me trip.

244
00:14:13,982 --> 00:14:18,444
Shut the fuck up.
You made me trip, dumb bitch!

245
00:14:28,705 --> 00:14:30,456
You fuckin' idiot!

246
00:14:56,649 --> 00:14:59,360

Any dead soldiers here?

00:16:12,475 --> 00:16:14,519
Uh, these two. Thank you.

260
00:16:16,313 --> 00:16:17,856
Where the hell is Lanna-Frank?

261
00:16:17,939 --> 00:16:21,026
That's a good fucking question.

262
00:16:31,578 --> 00:16:32,871
Lanna-Frank!

263
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,040
Where are you?

264
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,085
Well, come over already.
We're waiting for you.

265
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:42,422
- ##
- Shit! Hold on!

266
00:16:54,601 --> 00:16:56,228
So, where are you?

267
00:16:57,395 --> 00:16:59,397
Come over already.
We're waiting for you.

268
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:02,442
No. We're not coming over there.

269
00:17:02,526 --> 00:17:05,695
You come over here
like you said you would.

270
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:08,740
So, is it Shauna and the girls
at the lake house this weekend?

271
00:17:08,824 --> 00:17:11,284
- Shauna?
- Oh, fuck. l...

272
00:17:11,368 --> 00:17:12,369
No.

273
00:17:12,452 --> 00:17:15,372
Now, there is one thing
that every girl in the whole world

274
00:17:15,455 --> 00:17:18,250
whose name is Shanna
has in common with each other.

275
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,918
We all hate the name "Shauna,"

276
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,421
and we really hate it
when people call us "Shauna."

277
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:00,876
Just remember...

278
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:03,629
it's "Shanna Banana,"
not "Shauna Banauna."

279
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:06,882
Okay, but at some point in the evening,
I had fuckability stock.

280
00:18:06,965 --> 00:18:10,302
Yeah, I mean, it wasn't bullish, but...

281
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,995
##

282
00:18:37,037 --> 00:18:41,041
Okay... Warren's sending over shots,
and you know the house rules.

283
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,836
If he sends over shots,
you gotta do them.

284
00:18:43,877 --> 00:18:46,255
- What?
- Hey, them's the rules, baby.

285
00:18:46,338 --> 00:18:49,842
- Warren says it, we do it!
I love that philosophy!

286
00:18:49,925 --> 00:18:52,344
"Warren says it, we do it."

287
00:18:52,386 --> 00:18:54,388
So let's do it!

288
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,514
What is it?

289
00:18:55,556 --> 00:18:59,518
Hey, shot first, questions later.
Here we go. Post time!

290
00:19:00,728 --> 00:19:02,020
Mmm!

291
00:19:04,398 --> 00:19:05,941
Whoo-hoo!

292
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:13,365
Now, is that a tasty beverage
or is that a tasty beverage?

293
00:19:13,449 --> 00:19:14,700
What the fuck is it?!

294
00:19:14,783 --> 00:19:16,368
Chartreuse.

295
00:19:16,452 --> 00:19:19,663
The only liquor so good
they named a color after it.

296
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,125
<i>Who's down for dos Chartreuse?</i>

297
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,461
Not me.

298
00:19:25,544 --> 00:19:27,338
I'm going out for a smoke.

299
00:19:27,421 --> 00:19:29,798
Okay, but careful where you keep
that hot flame, all right?

300
00:19:29,882 --> 00:19:31,383
You 'll blow up the joint.

301
00:19:40,935 --> 00:19:42,895
##

302
00:19:44,772 --> 00:19:46,106
Drinks.
What can we get you?

303
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,274
Shanna Banana?

304
00:19:47,358 --> 00:19:49,902
Another big-ass
Long Island iced tea.

305
00:19:49,985 --> 00:19:52,947
Bombay Sapphire
and tonic with no ice.

306
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,740
Good boy.

307
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,429
Oh, hey, Punky.

308
00:20:17,513 --> 00:20:20,266
Uh, one of the lights
is off in the parking lot. Flip it.

309
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,343
- Oh! Jesus Christ!
- Whoa-ho!

310
00:20:57,511 --> 00:20:59,597
You scared the fuck out of me,
you shitty asshole!

311
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,183
I swear, Arlene.
I was not trying to scare you.

312
00:21:02,266 --> 00:21:04,101
I just... got lucky.

313
00:21:04,185 --> 00:21:05,978
Oh, hardee-fucking-har.

314
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,355
- Let's go inside.
- Wait a minute.

315
00:21:07,438 --> 00:21:10,316
- Why?
- I was thinkin' we could make out.

316
00:21:10,358 --> 00:21:11,359
What, on a porch?

317
00:21:11,442 --> 00:21:13,319
Not even in the bar,
but in front of the entrance?

318
00:21:13,361 --> 00:21:15,404
- Forget it.
- No, in my car.

319
00:21:15,488 --> 00:21:18,074
What, out there?
It's wet as fucking 'Nam out there.

320
00:21:18,157 --> 00:21:19,742
Not in my car it's not.

321
00:21:20,368 --> 00:21:22,370
Look, you won't get wet.

322
00:21:22,453 --> 00:21:24,622
I promise you.

323
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,085
You know, most guys
wouldn't brag about that.

324
00:21:29,168 --> 00:21:30,878
Ha ha ha.

325
00:21:30,962 --> 00:21:32,755
I mean...
you know what I mean.

326
00:21:32,838 --> 00:21:34,799
Look, I know you guys
are going to Lake L.B.J.

327
00:21:34,882 --> 00:21:36,217
and we can't come.

328
00:21:37,385 --> 00:21:39,011
I wanna make out...

329
00:21:39,053 --> 00:21:41,847
Okay, just stop with the whining.
It's not attractive.

330
00:21:47,937 --> 00:21:51,857
I don't want it super fucking obvious
to everybody in the bar we've been gone,

331
00:21:51,899 --> 00:21:55,528
- so we'll make out for six minutes, deal?
- Great.

332
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:56,863
No, no, no.
Deal or no deal?

333
00:21:56,946 --> 00:21:59,156
If you 're gonna whine
when I pull the plug in six minutes,

334
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,534
we could just walk back
inside the fucking bar right now.

335
00:22:01,576 --> 00:22:03,161
- Deal. No whining.
- And no begging.

336
00:22:03,244 --> 00:22:05,663
And no begging.
When you say "done," it's done.

337
00:22:05,746 --> 00:22:07,707
I'm gonna remember
you said that.

338
00:22:07,748 --> 00:22:08,916
Okay, let's go.

339
00:22:11,377 --> 00:22:15,173
Oh, you got two jobs... kiss good
and make sure my hair don't get wet.

340
00:22:24,307 --> 00:22:27,810
##

341
00:22:36,694 --> 00:22:39,447
<i># It was early. early one morning #</i>

342
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:42,575
<i># When I heard my bulldog bark #</i>

343
00:22:42,658 --> 00:22:45,912
<i># It was Staggolee and Billy Lyons #</i>

344
00:22:45,995 --> 00:22:47,997
<i># Squabblin ' in the dark... #</i>

345
00:22:48,081 --> 00:22:50,625
Now, look, you can't look like
you 're trying to get her out of here

346
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:52,085
before Christian Simonson shows up,

347
00:22:52,126 --> 00:22:54,754
but you 've got to get her out of here
before Christian Simonson shows up.

348
00:22:54,837 --> 00:22:55,838
Yeah, but what's the point?

349
00:22:55,922 --> 00:22:57,882
They're going to Shanna's
daddy's house at Lake L.B.J.,

350
00:22:57,965 --> 00:22:59,092
and it's no guys.

351
00:22:59,175 --> 00:23:00,760
Absolutely no guys.

352
00:23:00,802 --> 00:23:03,429
Okay. So after we bring
the girls' drinks,

353
00:23:03,471 --> 00:23:08,226
in fairly rapid order, but not obvious,
we order two more rounds of shots.

354
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:10,770
You think they're gonna fall for that?

355
00:23:10,812 --> 00:23:13,314
<i>We'll be very convincing.</i>

356
00:23:13,815 --> 00:23:16,025
Now it's time to turn up the volume.
No more fucking around.

357
00:23:16,109 --> 00:23:17,652
We go to Jäger shots.

358
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:20,905
Man, they're not gonna drink Jäger shots.

359
00:23:20,989 --> 00:23:22,448
Dude, as long as
a guy's buying the booze,

360
00:23:22,532 --> 00:23:24,575
<i>a fucking bitch
will drink anything.</i>

361
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:25,952
Come on, dude, we can
at least get one shot of Jäger

362
00:23:26,035 --> 00:23:27,704
down these
fucking bitches' throats.

363
00:23:27,787 --> 00:23:29,872
After that, we'll see if they get
another Jäger shot in them.

364
00:23:29,956 --> 00:23:30,915
You never know.

365
00:23:30,999 --> 00:23:33,418
That could be the shot
that puts them past the point of "fuck it."

366
00:23:33,501 --> 00:23:35,295
Then all of a sudden
"no guys at the lake house"

367
00:23:35,336 --> 00:23:37,297
turns into a couple of guys
at the lake house.

368
00:23:37,338 --> 00:23:38,840
My point exactly.

369
00:23:38,882 --> 00:23:41,009
And I know I can at least get
"Shanna Suck-my-banana"

370
00:23:41,092 --> 00:23:43,803
to do a fucking Buttery Nipple shot.
What's Julia's sweet shot?

371
00:23:44,804 --> 00:23:46,472
- Key Lime Pie.
- Oh, come on, dude.

372
00:23:46,514 --> 00:23:48,850
Even fucking Leroy Brown
would do one more for dessert.

373
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,189
Dude, check it out.

374
00:23:54,272 --> 00:23:56,316
I wonder if B.J.
brought the bear with him.

375
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,028
Jesus.

376
00:24:03,364 --> 00:24:06,117
Dude fucking cut himself
falling out of his time machine.

377
00:24:07,327 --> 00:24:10,580
Hi, could I get a chicken suit
for Stroker Ace, please?

378
00:24:11,831 --> 00:24:14,959
<i># See the hole
I shot in his head #</i>

379
00:24:15,043 --> 00:24:17,837
<i># The high sheriff
told the deputy #</i>

380
00:24:17,921 --> 00:24:20,924
<i># Get your pistols
and come with me #</i>

381
00:24:21,007 --> 00:24:24,385
<i># We got to go arrest
a bad man #</i>

382
00:24:24,469 --> 00:24:26,763
<i># Known as Staggolee... #</i>

383
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:33,353
<i># They laid them on the shelf</i>

384
00:24:33,395 --> 00:24:36,439
<i># If you want
that bad man Staggolee #</i>

385
00:24:36,523 --> 00:24:39,818
<i># You 'll have to arrest him yourself</i>

386
00:24:39,901 --> 00:24:42,487
<i># The high sheriff
asked the bartender... #</i>

387
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:44,614
And where did you two disappear to?

388
00:24:44,698 --> 00:24:45,949
I had to get something
out of the car,

389
00:24:46,032 --> 00:24:49,244
and Nate was gentlemanly enough
to escort me with his umbrella.

390
00:24:49,327 --> 00:24:51,204
Ah, good for you, Nate.

391
00:24:51,246 --> 00:24:53,707
You see that pretty girl
sitting by herself at the bar?

392
00:24:56,501 --> 00:24:58,128
Who, the dirty hippie?

393
00:24:58,211 --> 00:25:00,046
Meow. She's not a hippie.

394
00:25:00,088 --> 00:25:01,214
She might as well be a hippie.

395
00:25:02,966 --> 00:25:04,551
Thank you, Timmy boy.

396
00:25:05,635 --> 00:25:08,179
Well, do you know
what just happened to her?

397
00:25:08,263 --> 00:25:11,016
No, but I know she's
a skinny, fake, blonde bitch.

398
00:25:13,518 --> 00:25:16,146
Oh, I'm sorry.
You were telling a story?

399
00:25:16,229 --> 00:25:17,188
What about her?

400
00:25:19,941 --> 00:25:21,067
Hey, Warren!

401
00:25:21,151 --> 00:25:24,279
Is there anybody you could
vouch for to give me a ride home?

402
00:25:26,281 --> 00:25:29,409
Fair lady, your chariot awaits.

403
00:25:29,451 --> 00:25:31,369
You 've been eavesdropping?

404
00:25:31,453 --> 00:25:34,080
There's eavesdropping
and "can't help but hear."

405
00:25:34,164 --> 00:25:36,208
I think I belong
in the latter category.

406
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,169
So, uh, Icy Hot.

407
00:25:39,252 --> 00:25:41,463
You 're offering me a ride home?

408
00:25:41,546 --> 00:25:45,175
I'm offering you a lift if when
I'm ready to leave, you are, too.

409
00:25:45,258 --> 00:25:47,469
And when are you
thinking about leaving?

410
00:25:47,552 --> 00:25:49,429
Truthfully,
I'm not thinking about it.

411
00:25:50,096 --> 00:25:53,475
But when I do,
you will be the first to know.

412
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:55,936
Will you be able
to, uh, drive later?

413
00:25:55,977 --> 00:25:58,021
I know looks can be deceiving.

414
00:25:59,481 --> 00:26:00,941
But I'm a teetotaler.

415
00:26:01,024 --> 00:26:03,151
I've been drinking
club soda and lime all night,

416
00:26:03,235 --> 00:26:05,237
and now I'm building up
to my big drink.

417
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,616
- Which is what?
- Virgin piña colada.

418
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:13,328
Okay. Why would
someone who doesn't drink

419
00:26:13,412 --> 00:26:16,289
spend hours at a bar drinking water?

420
00:26:16,331 --> 00:26:20,001
You know, a bar offers
all kind of things other than alcohol.

421
00:26:20,085 --> 00:26:22,587
Mmm. Really?

422
00:26:22,671 --> 00:26:24,005
Like what?

423
00:26:26,133 --> 00:26:27,259
Women.

424
00:26:27,342 --> 00:26:29,803
Nacho grande platters.

425
00:26:29,845 --> 00:26:32,431
The fellowship
of some fascinating individuals,

426
00:26:32,514 --> 00:26:33,598
like Warren here.

427
00:26:34,891 --> 00:26:36,476
Alcohol is just a lubricant

428
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,938
for all the individual
encounters that a barroom offers.

429
00:26:40,022 --> 00:26:42,482
Ooh. Is that cowboy wisdom?

430
00:26:42,524 --> 00:26:44,484
I'm not a cowboy, Pam.

431
00:26:45,986 --> 00:26:47,154
I'm a stuntman.

432
00:26:47,195 --> 00:26:51,575
But that's a very
easy mistake to make.

433
00:26:51,658 --> 00:26:53,619
How do you know my name?

434
00:26:53,702 --> 00:26:56,830
When you were talking with Warren...

435
00:26:56,913 --> 00:26:58,248
couldn't help but overhear.

436
00:27:00,042 --> 00:27:01,043
Fair enough.

437
00:27:01,126 --> 00:27:02,753
So what's your name, Icy?

438
00:27:04,087 --> 00:27:05,547
Stuntman Mike.

439
00:27:06,548 --> 00:27:08,050
Stuntman Mike's your name?

440
00:27:08,133 --> 00:27:10,928
Tsk. You ask anybody.

441
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,513
Hey, Warren.

442
00:27:13,555 --> 00:27:14,932
Who is this guy?

443
00:27:15,015 --> 00:27:16,850
Stuntman Mike.

444
00:27:16,892 --> 00:27:18,936
And who the hell
is Stuntman Mike?

445
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:20,229
He's a stuntman.

446
00:27:20,312 --> 00:27:23,148
Warren! Six shots of Wild Turkey!

447
00:27:23,232 --> 00:27:25,859
<i># I' ve just got to know #</i>

448

Yeah!

Let's do 'em!

455
00:27:44,253 --> 00:27:45,879
<i>Salud.</i>

456
00:27:45,963 --> 00:27:47,714
Down the snatch.

457
00:27:47,756 --> 00:27:51,260
You know, Pam,
I think it's time for my big drink.

458
00:27:52,261 --> 00:27:55,889
Well, Stuntman Mike,
since I have a tab here,

459
00:27:55,973 --> 00:27:58,100
can I buy you that
virgin piña colada?

460
00:27:58,183 --> 00:28:00,394
Thank you, Pam.
That'd be lovely.

461
00:28:00,436 --> 00:28:01,937
Warren!

462
00:28:01,979 --> 00:28:05,107
A, uh, virgin piña colada
for my stuntman friend

463
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,818
and I'll have another
Cadillac Cabo Wabo margarita.

464
00:28:07,901 --> 00:28:09,611
Cabo Wabo, virgin.

<i># People. I' ve been misled #</i>

467
00:28:45,648 --> 00:28:49,360

468

- Ah!
- Hey, if it ain't Lanna-Frank.

475
00:29:13,676 --> 00:29:14,927
Mwah.

476
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:16,303
- Hey, baby.
- How are you?

477
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:17,680
<i>- # In my life before #
- Hey, what's up?</i>

478
00:29:17,763 --> 00:29:19,014
Hey!

479
00:29:19,098 --> 00:29:21,725
Hey, what's shakin', bacon?

480
00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:23,769
Hey.

481
00:29:23,853 --> 00:29:26,647
<i># Go wrong as I do today #</i>

482
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:29,692

- Well, let's scootch over, now.</i>

483
00:29:29,775 --> 00:29:31,735
It's about fucking time.

484
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:34,113
Well, beggars can't be choosers.

485
00:29:34,697 --> 00:29:36,824
Take a picture.
It lasts longer.

486
00:29:38,075 --> 00:29:39,243
What?

487
00:29:39,326 --> 00:29:40,453
That table.

488
00:29:40,536 --> 00:29:42,413
Seems to keep,
um, getting your attention.

489
00:29:42,496 --> 00:29:44,957
Is that the girl
from the billboard outside?

490
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,041
Yep.

491
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:49,295
She sure is a striking-looking woman.

492
00:29:49,378 --> 00:29:51,297
It's got gin, tequila, Jäger...

493
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,339
Look at that hair.

494
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:53,841
Lots of leave-in conditioner.

495
00:29:55,384 --> 00:29:57,344
Is that jealousy I detect?

496
00:29:57,428 --> 00:30:01,390
Hardly. But if you want
to get with, uh, Jungle Julia,

497
00:30:01,474 --> 00:30:03,309
there's a real easy way to do that.

498
00:30:03,392 --> 00:30:04,935
Really, what would that be?

499
00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:08,439
Get famous. You won't have
to find her... she'll find you.

500
00:30:08,522 --> 00:30:11,859
And you don't even want to know
what she did for that billboard.

501
00:30:11,942 --> 00:30:13,486
Enjoy it, cocksucker.

502
00:30:13,569 --> 00:30:14,987
You 've earned it.

503
00:30:15,071 --> 00:30:16,989
What did she ever do to you?

504
00:30:17,073 --> 00:30:19,700
We went to school together
from kindergarten through high school.

505
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:21,744
That's what she did to me.

506
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:24,372
She was her height right now at 12.

507
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,290
She was a monster.

508
00:30:26,374 --> 00:30:30,252
Half the guys she still fucks
she used to terrorize in the fifth grade.

509
00:30:30,336 --> 00:30:33,130
And she used to beat you up
and take your chocolate milk, huh?

510
00:30:33,214 --> 00:30:34,715
That pituitary case?

511
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,509
Might have kicked my ass
a couple of times...

512
00:30:36,592 --> 00:30:39,387
sorry, I'm built like a girl,
not a black man...

513
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:43,140
but I'd die before I ever gave
Julia Lucai my chocolate milk.

514
00:31:14,797 --> 00:31:18,509
Hey! Are you
famous or somethin'?

515
00:31:18,593 --> 00:31:19,927
Or somethin'.

516
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:21,387
No, no, no. Really.

517
00:31:22,555 --> 00:31:24,390
Hey, what do... what do you do?

518
00:31:25,308 --> 00:31:26,601
Really?

519
00:31:26,642 --> 00:31:30,563
What I do is work my ass off to get
my own record label off the ground,

520
00:31:30,646 --> 00:31:35,109
but why that girl wanted a picture of me
is because I'm a local D.J.

521
00:31:37,612 --> 00:31:39,030
Wait a minute.

522
00:31:40,323 --> 00:31:43,868
You 've got a billboard
by Big Kahuna Burger, don't you?

523
00:31:43,951 --> 00:31:45,411
Yeah.

524
00:31:45,495 --> 00:31:47,872
I got one there, too, Zatoichi.

525
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:51,959
Yeah.

526
00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:55,254
Jungle Julia Lucai.

527
00:31:55,338 --> 00:31:57,256
Stuntman Mike McKay.

528
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,674
Well.

529
00:31:58,758 --> 00:32:01,844
Good to meet you, Stuntman Mike.

530
00:32:01,928 --> 00:32:04,263
My friends and I are going
to continue to get our weed on.

531
00:32:04,347 --> 00:32:05,598
Would you care for some?

532
00:32:05,682 --> 00:32:07,100
Thank you, Julia,

533
00:32:07,183 --> 00:32:10,019
but just the same...
no thanks.

534
00:32:10,103 --> 00:32:11,604
- Suit yourself.
- But you know...

535
00:32:21,698 --> 00:32:23,658
Oh, shit.

536
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,867
Ah! My God.

537
00:32:27,704 --> 00:32:28,830
Sorry. It's nothing.

538
00:32:32,458 --> 00:32:33,835
What the fuck was that?

539
00:32:38,381 --> 00:32:40,258
You got some voucher here.

540
00:32:40,341 --> 00:32:42,010
I asked him
what movies you worked on.

541
00:32:42,051 --> 00:32:43,761
No fuckin' clue.

542
00:32:43,845 --> 00:32:47,056
Well, technically I really don't know
if he's ever done anything for sure.

543
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,101
<i>I mean, he shows me
an episode of High Chaparral.</i>

544
00:32:50,184 --> 00:32:51,561
a guy falls off a horse,

545
00:32:51,644 --> 00:32:52,729
he says it's him.

546
00:32:54,522 --> 00:32:56,733
<i>You know the show The Virginian?</i>

547
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:01,154
Yeah, well, there was another
actor on that show, Gary Clarke,

548
00:33:01,237 --> 00:33:03,072
and I looked like him a bit...

549
00:33:03,156 --> 00:33:06,326
well, obviously
before I cut myself shaving.

550
00:33:06,409 --> 00:33:08,369
Tsk. Aww, I like it.

551
00:33:08,411 --> 00:33:12,665
Well, damn, if you ain't so sweet
you make sugar taste just like salt.

552
00:33:12,749 --> 00:33:16,169
<i>Anyway, I did a lot of Virginians
doubling Gary Clarke.</i>

553
00:33:16,252 --> 00:33:19,964
<i>And, uh... then that show turned
into The Men of Shiloh.</i>

554
00:33:20,048 --> 00:33:22,759
they brought on Lee Majors,
and I doubled him.

555
00:33:22,842 --> 00:33:26,096
From that point on
I specialized mostly in car stunts.

556
00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:29,724
<i>Yeah, I did damn near
the whole third season of Vega$ .</i>

557
00:33:29,808 --> 00:33:32,060
I was Robert Urich's driving double.

558
00:33:32,102 --> 00:33:34,979
<i>And then Bob
did another show, Gavilan.</i>

559
00:33:35,063 --> 00:33:37,524
and he brought me
with him on that, till...

560
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,568
And after that...

561
00:33:44,781 --> 00:33:48,118
Do you know any of these shows
or people I'm talkin' about?

562
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:49,577
Sorry.

563
00:33:49,619 --> 00:33:50,620
- No?
- Mm-mm.

564
00:33:50,704 --> 00:33:52,372
No, no.

565
00:33:54,958 --> 00:34:00,171
So how exactly does one
become a stuntman, Stuntman Mike?

566
00:34:02,424 --> 00:34:06,594
Well, in Hollywood, anybody fool enough
to throw himself down a flight of stairs

567
00:34:06,636 --> 00:34:09,389
can usually find somebody
to pay him for it.

568
00:34:09,472 --> 00:34:13,101
But really I got into the business the way
most people get into the stunt business.

569
00:34:13,143 --> 00:34:14,436
How's that?

570
00:34:14,477 --> 00:34:16,980
- My brother got me in it.
- Well, who's your brother?

571
00:34:17,063 --> 00:34:18,440
Stuntman Bob.

572
00:34:31,995 --> 00:34:33,163
I'm ready to blaze!

573
00:34:33,246 --> 00:34:36,124
Finally, yeah.
You need to catch up with us.

574
00:34:36,166 --> 00:34:38,460
- Now the party can start.
- Yep.

575
00:34:38,501 --> 00:34:41,838
Anywho, I'm sorry.
You forgive me?

576
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:47,594
But you have to be real nice to me
for the whole rest of the time I'm here.

577
00:34:47,677 --> 00:34:49,804
Promise.
You ready to go to the lake?

578
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:50,889
Mm-hmm.

579
00:34:50,972 --> 00:34:53,725
- How about your friend, bring him?
- I thought no boys.

580
00:34:53,808 --> 00:34:56,019
If you really want him to come,
Shanna won't mind.

581
00:34:56,102 --> 00:34:58,688
So how about it?
Boys or just us girls?

582
00:34:58,772 --> 00:35:00,482
Mmm, us girls.

583
00:35:00,524 --> 00:35:01,817
Good idea.

584
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:04,820
Ladies?

585
00:35:07,197 --> 00:35:08,198
Thanks.

586
00:35:09,366 --> 00:35:11,118
Cheers, Butterfly.

587
00:35:13,537 --> 00:35:17,833
"The woods are lovely,
dark, and deep...

588
00:35:17,874 --> 00:35:19,668
"And I have promises to keep,

589
00:35:19,709 --> 00:35:23,130
And miles to go
before I sleep."

590
00:35:23,213 --> 00:35:25,173
Did you hear me, Butterfly?

591
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:30,178
"Miles to go
before you sleep."

592
00:35:32,055 --> 00:35:33,557
Sorry, Stuntman Burt...

593
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,808
Mike.

594
00:35:34,975 --> 00:35:36,268
Mike.

595
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:38,311
She already broke off that dance.

596
00:35:38,395 --> 00:35:39,896
Is that true?

597
00:35:41,565 --> 00:35:44,192
Did I miss my chance?

598
00:35:46,903 --> 00:35:48,947
Do I frighten you?

599
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:55,245
Is it my scar?

600
00:35:57,414 --> 00:35:59,166
It's your car.

601
00:35:59,249 --> 00:36:01,293
Ah, yeah, I know.

602
00:36:01,376 --> 00:36:03,545
Sorry.

603
00:36:03,587 --> 00:36:05,422
It's my mom's car.

604
00:36:07,883 --> 00:36:09,551
Have you been following us?

605
00:36:09,635 --> 00:36:12,346
No, but that's
what I love about Austin...

606
00:36:12,429 --> 00:36:14,681
it's just so damn small.

607
00:36:14,765 --> 00:36:17,392
- You 've seen this guy before?
- I saw him outside of Guero's.

608
00:36:17,434 --> 00:36:19,853
And I saw you outside Guero's, too.

609
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:23,732
You saw my car,
I saw your legs.

610
00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:27,152
Now, look, I ain't stalking y'all,
but I didn't say I wasn't a wolf.

611
00:36:27,236 --> 00:36:29,196
So you really weren't following us?

612
00:36:29,279 --> 00:36:33,075
I'm not following you, Butterfly.
I just... got lucky.

613
00:36:35,369 --> 00:36:39,665
So, how about that lap dance?

614
00:36:39,748 --> 00:36:41,458
Sorry, it was a one-time only offer,

615
00:36:41,542 --> 00:36:43,919
and she did it
earlier this evening at Antone's.

616
00:36:45,379 --> 00:36:47,381
- No, she didn't.
- How do you know?

617
00:36:47,464 --> 00:36:49,508
I'm good that way.

618
00:36:49,591 --> 00:36:53,387
- Tsk. And you look a little touchéd.
- What's "touchéd"?

619
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:54,638
Wounded, slightly.

620
00:36:54,721 --> 00:36:55,973
Why should I be wounded?

621
00:36:56,056 --> 00:36:59,017
Because you expected guys
to be pestering you all night,

622
00:36:59,101 --> 00:37:01,854
but from your look I can tell
nobody pestered you at all.

623
00:37:03,105 --> 00:37:05,524
That kind of hurt your feelings
a little bit, didn't it?

624
00:37:07,151 --> 00:37:12,489
There are few things as fetching
as a bruised ego on a beautiful angel.

625
00:37:16,285 --> 00:37:17,244
So...

626
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:22,374
How about that lap dance?

627
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,211
I think I'm going
to have to give you a rain check.

628
00:37:29,089 --> 00:37:31,300
Well, since you 'll be leaving
in the next couple of days,

629
00:37:31,383 --> 00:37:33,385
that rain check'll be worthless.

630
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:36,680
But that's okay.

631
00:37:38,557 --> 00:37:40,809
I understand
if I make you uncomfortable.

632
00:37:41,685 --> 00:37:43,479
You 're still a nice girl.

633
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:45,356
And I still like you.

634
00:37:46,774 --> 00:37:48,942
But I must warn you of something.

635
00:37:50,152 --> 00:37:52,613
You know how people say,

636
00:37:52,696 --> 00:37:54,406
"You 're okay in my book,"

637
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:57,743
or, "In my book, that's no good."

638
00:37:57,826 --> 00:38:03,499
Well, I actually have a book.

639
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:07,461
And everybody
I ever meet goes in this book.

640
00:38:07,544 --> 00:38:11,924
And now I've met you,
and you 're goin' in the book.

641
00:38:13,384 --> 00:38:15,177
Except...

642
00:38:15,261 --> 00:38:19,390
I'm afraid I must file you...

643
00:38:19,473 --> 00:38:21,392
under...

644
00:38:21,475 --> 00:38:22,977
"Chicken Shit."

645
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,354
And what if I did it?

646
00:38:25,437 --> 00:38:27,690
Well, I definitely couldn't
file you under "Chicken Shit,"

647
00:38:27,773 --> 00:38:29,859
then, now, could I?

648
00:38:29,942 --> 00:38:31,235
What's your name again?

649
00:38:32,653 --> 00:38:35,531
- Stuntman Mike.
- Well, Stuntman Mike...

650
00:38:35,614 --> 00:38:37,158
I'm Butterfly.

651
00:38:37,241 --> 00:38:41,787
My friend Jungle Julia over here says
that jukebox inside is pretty impressive.

652
00:38:41,871 --> 00:38:43,581
Yeah, it is.

653
00:38:43,664 --> 00:38:44,665
Yeah.

654
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:47,960
Well, why don't you go
get ready for your lap dance?

655
00:39:02,057 --> 00:39:05,060
What about "kind of cute,
kind of hot, kind of sexy,

656
00:39:05,144 --> 00:39:06,979
"hysterically funny
but not funny-looking guy

657
00:39:07,063 --> 00:39:09,899
who you could fuck"
did you not understand?

658
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,943

We're gonna go somewhere else,
gonna go hang out.

710
00:42:05,742 --> 00:42:06,701
Ready to go?

711
00:42:06,784 --> 00:42:07,994
Yeah.

712
00:42:08,077 --> 00:42:09,829
- Bye.
Bye.

713
00:42:13,124 --> 00:42:15,335
I think you got Mike laid tonight.

714
00:42:16,961 --> 00:42:19,088
Lookin' good, Cannonball Run!

715
00:42:20,256 --> 00:42:22,175
He's just giving me a ride.

716
00:42:22,258 --> 00:42:23,259
Oh, no doubt.

717
00:42:23,343 --> 00:42:25,637
Have a nice ride!

718
00:42:27,055 --> 00:42:28,932
Look, double fucks.

719
00:42:33,269 --> 00:42:35,230
I am not gonna fuck him.

720
00:42:35,313 --> 00:42:36,731
I can hear you.

721
00:42:38,149 --> 00:42:41,653
- He's old enough to be my dad.
- I can still hear you.

722
00:42:44,906 --> 00:42:46,074
Bye.

723
00:42:46,157 --> 00:42:47,200
Bye-bye!

724
00:42:53,581 --> 00:42:55,542
Wow, that's fucking scary.

725
00:42:55,625 --> 00:42:57,627
Yeah, well, I wanted it
to be impressive and...

726
00:42:57,711 --> 00:42:59,754
scary tends to impress.

727
00:43:01,172 --> 00:43:02,340
Is it safe?

728
00:43:02,424 --> 00:43:04,384
No, it's better than safe.

729
00:43:04,467 --> 00:43:06,094
It's death-proof.

730
00:43:06,177 --> 00:43:08,680
How do you make a car death-proof?

731
00:43:08,763 --> 00:43:10,557
Well, that's what stuntmen do.

732
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,268
You 've seen a movie where
a car gets into some smash-up

733
00:43:13,351 --> 00:43:15,770
there ain't no way in hell
anybody's walking away from?

734
00:43:15,854 --> 00:43:16,813
Yeah.

735
00:43:16,896 --> 00:43:19,399
Well, how do you
think they accomplish that?

736
00:43:19,482 --> 00:43:21,484
CGI?

737
00:43:21,568 --> 00:43:25,530
Well, unfortunately, Pam, nowadays
more often than not, you 're right.

738
00:43:25,572 --> 00:43:27,824
Tsk. But back
in the all-or-nothin' days...

739
00:43:27,907 --> 00:43:31,703
<i>Vanishing Point days,
the Dirty Mary Crazy Larry days,</i>

740
00:43:31,786 --> 00:43:33,455
<i>the White Line Fever days...</i>

741
00:43:33,538 --> 00:43:36,499
real cars smashing into real cars.

742
00:43:36,541 --> 00:43:39,169
Real dumb people driving 'em.

743
00:43:39,252 --> 00:43:42,297
So, give the stunt team
the car you want to smash up,

744
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,925
they take her and reinforce
that fucker everywhere and...

745
00:43:45,008 --> 00:43:45,967
<i>Voila!</i>

746
00:43:46,051 --> 00:43:49,512
You got yourself
a death-proof automobile.

747
00:43:51,056 --> 00:43:54,643
That makes sense. I just didn't know
you could make a car death-proof.

748
00:43:54,726 --> 00:43:58,522
Well, I can drive this baby into
a brick wall doing 125 miles an hour.

749
00:43:59,356 --> 00:44:00,774
Just for the experience.

750
00:44:07,531 --> 00:44:09,741
Why is your passenger seat in a box?

751
00:44:09,825 --> 00:44:11,326
Well, this is a movie car.

752
00:44:11,409 --> 00:44:14,955
Sometimes when you 're shootin' a crash,
director wants to put a camera in the car...

753
00:44:15,038 --> 00:44:17,207
you know, shoot the crash
from the inside.

754
00:44:17,249 --> 00:44:20,210
That's where you put the camera.
They call it a "crash box."

755
00:44:22,921 --> 00:44:24,589
There you go.

756
00:44:24,673 --> 00:44:26,967
You know, when you
asked to drive me home,

757
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:28,927
you didn't mention your car
didn't have a passenger seat.

758
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:32,013
Yeah, well, actually,
I didn't ask to drive you home.

759
00:44:32,097 --> 00:44:33,974
You asked me for a ride,
and I said, "Yes."

760
00:44:34,057 --> 00:44:35,392
But look at the bright side, Pam...

761
00:44:35,434 --> 00:44:38,395
I won't be gettin' fresh,
putting my hand on your knee.

762
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:42,023
That is a bright side.

763
00:44:43,066 --> 00:44:44,234
I thought so.

764
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:11,637
Well, Pam...

765
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:12,971
which way are you going?

766
00:45:13,055 --> 00:45:14,890
- Left or right?
- Right.

767
00:45:14,973 --> 00:45:16,933
Ah, that's too bad.

768
00:45:17,601 --> 00:45:18,602
Why?

769
00:45:18,685 --> 00:45:22,564
Well, because it was a 50/50 shot
on whether you 'd be going left or right.

770
00:45:22,648 --> 00:45:24,775
You see, we're both going left.

771
00:45:24,816 --> 00:45:26,818
You could have just
as easily been going left, too,

772
00:45:26,902 --> 00:45:28,195
and if that was the case,

773
00:45:28,278 --> 00:45:30,948
it would have been a while
before you started getting scared.

774
00:45:30,989 --> 00:45:33,367
But since
you 're going the other way,

775
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:34,993
I'm afraid...

776
00:45:35,077 --> 00:45:38,455
you 're gonna
have to start getting scared...

777
00:45:38,538 --> 00:45:39,581
immediately.

778
00:45:39,665 --> 00:45:40,749
What the fuck?!

779
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,135
Cocksucking motherfucker!

780
00:45:52,177 --> 00:45:53,762
Just fucking let me out of here!

781
00:45:53,846 --> 00:45:55,430
I'll fucking rip your fucking...

782
00:45:55,514 --> 00:45:56,890
Stop the fucking car!

783
00:45:56,974 --> 00:45:58,809
Why are you being such a shit?

784
00:46:39,058 --> 00:46:40,851
Okay.

785
00:46:40,934 --> 00:46:42,353
Here's the thing.

786
00:46:42,394 --> 00:46:44,521
I get it.

787
00:46:44,563 --> 00:46:47,274
l... I know it's a joke,
and super funny.

788
00:46:48,067 --> 00:46:51,862
Um, but if you just stop right now,

789
00:46:51,904 --> 00:46:54,323
you know, and... and let me out,

790
00:46:54,406 --> 00:46:57,743
I'll never tell anybody
because I know it's a joke.

791
00:46:57,826 --> 00:46:59,161
I know all about jokes.

792
00:46:59,244 --> 00:47:00,663
Ha ha ha!

793
00:47:00,746 --> 00:47:04,166
I promise everything'll be fine.

794
00:47:04,249 --> 00:47:06,710
Just... just... just let me out.

795
00:47:06,794 --> 00:47:07,795
Please?

796
00:47:07,878 --> 00:47:09,630
- And... and... and...
- Hey, Pam!

797
00:47:10,714 --> 00:47:14,176
Remember when I said
this car was death proof?

798
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:17,554
Well, that wasn't a lie.

799
00:47:17,596 --> 00:47:20,224
This car is 100% death proof.

800
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:24,103
Only to get the benefit of it, honey...

801
00:47:24,144 --> 00:47:27,147
you really need to be sittin' in my seat.

802
00:48:04,602 --> 00:48:08,189
Now I gotta catch me
my other girlfriends.

803
00:48:22,661 --> 00:48:23,662
No, no, no, no, no, no.

804
00:48:23,746 --> 00:48:26,957
It's Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick and Tich.

805
00:48:27,875 --> 00:48:29,418
So, you got it?

806
00:48:29,502 --> 00:48:32,380
Thanks, honey.
You 're gonna play it next song, right?

807
00:48:33,631 --> 00:48:35,466
Good boy.

808
00:48:36,967 --> 00:48:38,636
Growl!

809
00:48:38,678 --> 00:48:40,763
Bye-bye.

810
00:48:40,846 --> 00:48:42,264
Who do you want to hear?

811
00:48:42,348 --> 00:48:44,225
Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick, and Tich.

812
00:48:44,308 --> 00:48:45,559
Who?

813
00:48:45,643 --> 00:48:49,271
Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick, and Tich.

814
00:48:49,355 --> 00:48:50,731
Who the fuck are they?

815
00:48:50,815 --> 00:48:53,609
For your information,
Pete Townshend, at one point,

816
00:48:53,693 --> 00:48:55,444
almost quit The Who,
and if he had,

817
00:48:55,528 --> 00:48:57,154
he would have ended up in this group,

818
00:48:57,238 --> 00:49:00,992
thus making it Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick, Tich, and Pete.

819
00:49:01,033 --> 00:49:02,618
And if you ask me,
he should have.

820
00:49:03,744 --> 00:49:06,080
That's my boy!

821
00:49:06,163 --> 00:49:09,333

I want to hear
this part of the song louder!

841
00:51:44,572 --> 00:51:46,241
Do you remember anything?

842
00:51:48,201 --> 00:51:50,495
Uh... l... I don't remember.

843
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,500
Doctor Block.

844
00:52:02,382 --> 00:52:04,968
<i>Self-restraints to Room 310.</i>

845
00:52:05,051 --> 00:52:07,429
<i>Self-restraints to Room 310.</i>

846
00:52:08,638 --> 00:52:13,935
Well. What's the patient's
prognosis, Dr. Block?

847
00:52:14,019 --> 00:52:16,229
I don't really see
it's any of your business.

848
00:52:16,312 --> 00:52:18,148
Come on now, Sis.

849
00:52:18,231 --> 00:52:20,525
You just tell us.

850
00:52:20,567 --> 00:52:21,901
How bad is he?

851
00:52:26,573 --> 00:52:28,325
He got banged up real good.

852
00:52:28,408 --> 00:52:32,787
Busted nose, broken collarbone,
smashed up his left index finger.

853
00:52:32,871 --> 00:52:34,039
Is that it?

854
00:52:35,874 --> 00:52:37,584
He was real lucky.

855
00:52:39,794 --> 00:52:41,546
That'll be all?

856
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:44,925
Well, that's more than enough,
and I wanna thank you, Dr. Block.

857
00:52:48,762 --> 00:52:50,263
Son of a bitch.

858
00:52:51,806 --> 00:52:53,391
So, Pop.

859
00:52:53,475 --> 00:52:55,018
What do you think?

860
00:52:55,101 --> 00:52:56,895
Well, Son Number One,

861
00:52:56,978 --> 00:53:01,149
what I think is so goddamn ghoulish
I hesitate to speak it out loud.

862
00:53:02,192 --> 00:53:04,444
Well, give it a shot.

863
00:53:04,528 --> 00:53:07,531
Well, what we have here
is a case of vehicular homicide.

864
00:53:07,614 --> 00:53:10,367
That ol' boy in there
murdered them pretty little gals.

865
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:14,204
I mean, he used a car, not a hatchet,
but they're dead just the same.

866
00:53:15,789 --> 00:53:18,792
Well, what are you gonna do?

867
00:53:18,875 --> 00:53:20,585
Not a goddamn thing.

868
00:53:20,627 --> 00:53:22,921
D.A. says there ain't no crime here.

869
00:53:23,797 --> 00:53:28,760
Every one of them gals was swimming
in alcohol and floatin' on weed,

870
00:53:28,802 --> 00:53:32,681
and old Hooper in there
came out clean as a whistle.

871
00:53:32,764 --> 00:53:37,144
Now, you actually think that he
premeditatively murdered them gals?

872
00:53:37,227 --> 00:53:38,979
Well, I can't prove it.

873
00:53:39,062 --> 00:53:42,232
But since thinkin' don't cost nothin',
I can think it, and I do.

874
00:53:42,315 --> 00:53:45,652
Yeah, but Pop, he got
pretty banged up himself.

875
00:53:45,736 --> 00:53:48,238
Well, hell yeah,
he got banged up, but goddamn...

876
00:53:48,321 --> 00:53:51,074
I mean, them pretty little gals in there
look like a goddamn giant

877
00:53:51,158 --> 00:53:52,826
chewed 'em up and spit 'em out.

878
00:53:52,909 --> 00:53:54,286
Did any of 'em survive?

879
00:53:54,327 --> 00:53:56,246
Shit.

880
00:53:56,329 --> 00:53:58,790
Two tons of metal,
200 miles an hour,

881
00:53:58,832 --> 00:54:01,251
flesh and bone
and plain old Newton...

882
00:54:01,334 --> 00:54:03,420
they all princess died.

883
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:11,928
Why?

884
00:54:12,012 --> 00:54:16,308
Well, I'd guesstimate
it's a sex thing.

885
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:18,352
The only way I can figure it.

886
00:54:18,435 --> 00:54:23,565
High-velocity impact,
twisted metal, busted glass,

887
00:54:23,649 --> 00:54:26,693
all four souls taken
exactly the same time.

888
00:54:28,028 --> 00:54:32,032
Probably the only way that diabolical
degenerate can shoot his goo.

889
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,744
Yeah, I think the only thing
we can dream of getting that bastard on

890
00:54:35,827 --> 00:54:39,289
is vehicular manslaughter
for the hitchhiker in the death box.

891
00:54:39,373 --> 00:54:42,251
That was just plain old,
goddamn reckless endangerment.

892
00:54:42,334 --> 00:54:45,295
But I got me a goddamn bartender

893
00:54:45,379 --> 00:54:49,007
gonna testify that ol' Stuntman
Mike didn't drink a drop all night.

894
00:54:49,841 --> 00:54:52,678
And his passenger
was left stranded by her date,

895
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:56,473
in the goddamn rain, no less,
and she asked him for the fucking ride.

896
00:54:56,557 --> 00:55:00,352
Now, on paper, this is gonna look
like he was just trying to help her out.

897
00:55:00,435 --> 00:55:02,729
I mean, that's the way
the jury's gonna see it.

898
00:55:02,813 --> 00:55:05,023
So, what are you gonna do, Pop?

899
00:55:05,065 --> 00:55:06,149
Tsk.

900
00:55:06,233 --> 00:55:09,194
Well, I could take it
upon myself to work the case,

901
00:55:11,655 --> 00:55:14,825
Search for evidence,
you know, prove my theory.

902
00:55:14,908 --> 00:55:16,160
Alert authorities.

903
00:55:16,243 --> 00:55:19,830
Dog that rotten son of a bitch...
wherever he goes, I go.

904
00:55:19,913 --> 00:55:25,043
Or I could spend the same
goddamn amount of time and energy

905
00:55:25,127 --> 00:55:28,046
following the NASCAR circuit.

906
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:30,257
Hmm. I've thought about it a lot.

907
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:33,802
I think I'd have a hell
of a lot happier life if I did the latter.

908
00:55:33,886 --> 00:55:34,887
And just because I can't

909
00:55:34,928 --> 00:55:39,183
punish Old Frankenstein
in there for what he's done,

910
00:55:39,266 --> 00:55:42,061
I'm gonna tell you
like the Lord told John...

911
00:55:42,102 --> 00:55:44,104
if he ever does it again,

912
00:55:44,188 --> 00:55:47,483
I can make goddamn sure
he don't do it in Texas.

913
00:55:47,775 --> 00:55:51,236

Are you on the same floor as him?
No, he's on the fourth.

933
00:57:16,697 --> 00:57:19,033
- And who's in whose room?
- He's in mine.

934
00:57:19,116 --> 00:57:20,367
And so what happened then?

935
00:57:20,451 --> 00:57:24,705
We made out for about ten minutes,
and then I sent him off to his room.

936
00:57:24,789 --> 00:57:28,375
- So how's the Rock as a kisser?
- Mm, he's damn good.

937
00:57:28,459 --> 00:57:31,253
He's got them mushy lips,
smooth fingertips.

938
00:57:31,337 --> 00:57:33,214
Mm, I love them mushy lips.

939
00:57:33,297 --> 00:57:36,425
He's a big guy, so he spins me around
so my back is up against him,

940
00:57:36,509 --> 00:57:39,053
takes his big hand
and puts it on my throat,

941
00:57:39,136 --> 00:57:43,599
tilts my head back and leans over me,
kisses me from behind.

942
00:57:43,683 --> 00:57:45,059
Damn, that sounds sexy!

943
00:57:45,142 --> 00:57:46,686
It was sexy.

944
00:57:46,727 --> 00:57:50,648
But then that was it?
You sent him off? How'd he take it?

945
00:57:50,731 --> 00:57:52,400
Wait a minute, what are we doing here?

946
00:57:52,483 --> 00:57:56,195
If I'm gonna power through and pick up
Zoë at the airport, I need coffee.

947
00:57:56,278 --> 00:58:00,116
Since you 're getting that, can you get
some more vodka and sugar-free Red Bull?

948
00:58:02,493 --> 00:58:03,786
We didn't know you were awake.

949
00:58:03,869 --> 00:58:05,538
I'm not awake. I'm asleep.

950
00:58:05,621 --> 00:58:08,708
But get some more vodka
and some sugar-free Red Bull anyway.

951
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,960
And some Red Apple Tans.

952
00:58:11,043 --> 00:58:13,504
Damn, I didn't stop
to get you bitches groceries.

953
00:58:15,756 --> 00:58:18,175
- You remember how to get to the airport?
Uh-huh.

954
00:58:18,259 --> 00:58:21,053
Then you should get behind the wheel,
'cause you gonna drive.

955
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:24,432
Motherfuckers.

956
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:43,159
They ain't got sugar-free Red Bull.

957
00:58:43,242 --> 00:58:45,828
They got regular Red Bull
and sugar-free G.O. juice.

958
00:58:45,912 --> 00:58:48,623
G.O.
G.O.!

959
00:59:13,898 --> 00:59:20,029
# It's not the way you kiss
that says you 're mine #

960
00:59:23,408 --> 00:59:27,870
# Many, many, many nights go by #

961
00:59:27,954 --> 00:59:33,710
# I sit alone at home and cry over you #

962
00:59:33,793 --> 00:59:36,963
# What can I do #

963
00:59:37,046 --> 00:59:42,510
# Don't want nobody, nobody #

964
00:59:42,593 --> 00:59:45,888
# 'Cause, baby, it's you #

965
00:59:55,356 --> 00:59:58,943
# Is it true what they say #

966
00:59:58,985 --> 01:00:03,156
# All about you #

967
01:00:05,158 --> 01:00:10,622
# They say you 'll never
ever never be true #

968
01:00:13,207 --> 01:00:17,879
# It doesn't matter what they say #

969
01:00:17,962 --> 01:00:21,507
# I know I'm gonna
love you any old way #

970
01:00:21,591 --> 01:00:24,552
# What would I do #

971
01:00:24,636 --> 01:00:27,847
# Without you #

972
01:00:27,889 --> 01:00:30,225
# I don't want nobody... #

973
01:00:30,517 --> 01:00:33,353
Where the hell are my keys?
Here they are.

974
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:37,315
Sorry, I didn't mean to give
you a concert there.

975
01:00:37,398 --> 01:00:39,526
No, it wasn't you.

976
01:00:39,609 --> 01:00:42,320
That guy bumped into my feet
when he walked by.

977
01:00:43,738 --> 01:00:46,574
I don't know why,
but that kind of creeped me out.

978
01:01:02,465 --> 01:01:05,510
<i># I don 't care
what they saying to me #</i>

979
01:01:12,183 --> 01:01:13,685
Little dick.

980
01:01:15,562 --> 01:01:16,896
Clearly.

981
01:01:18,481 --> 01:01:23,528
Since I'm up,
I might as well hit the ATM.

982
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:26,906
Get me a fuckin' smoke.

983
01:02:51,116 --> 01:02:52,868
What?

984
01:02:52,951 --> 01:02:54,911
Did you just see the...

985
01:02:54,995 --> 01:02:55,954
What?

986
01:02:58,248 --> 01:02:59,374
Nothing, honey.

987
01:03:23,023 --> 01:03:23,982
Y'ello.

988
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:25,400
It's me.

989
01:03:25,484 --> 01:03:26,777
Miss me?

990
01:03:28,278 --> 01:03:30,864
You best get your ass
off Kim's car.

991
01:03:30,947 --> 01:03:34,701
- I've seen Kim sit on it before.
- Her ass ain't your ass.

992
01:03:34,785 --> 01:03:39,206
<i>Okay. So, I think I'm in
this month's issue of Allure.</i>

993
01:03:42,793 --> 01:03:44,294
<i>You got Allure?</i>

994
01:03:44,378 --> 01:03:46,255
Magazines by the window.

995
01:04:00,644 --> 01:04:02,312
Here you are!

996
01:04:05,315 --> 01:04:07,025
You hot mama, you.

997
01:04:07,067 --> 01:04:08,902
See you in a second.

998
01:04:08,986 --> 01:04:12,072
$3.85... out of 20.

999
01:04:16,201 --> 01:04:19,163
And you get 16 and change back.
Thank you very much.

1000
01:04:21,582 --> 01:04:24,793
You know, I got other fashion magazines
for sale behind the counter.

1001
01:04:27,337 --> 01:04:29,756
No, that's okay.
This'll be all.

1002
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,008
Thought I'd ask.

1003
01:04:31,049 --> 01:04:32,843
- Thanks anyway.
- Have a good one.

1004
01:04:35,971 --> 01:04:38,640
<i>I got this month's issue
of Italian Vogue.</i>

1005
01:04:43,896 --> 01:04:45,147
This month's?

1006
01:04:46,982 --> 01:04:49,234
Listen to this.

1007
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:54,073
<i>The Circle A clerk has
this month's issue of Italian Vogue.</i>

1008
01:04:54,114 --> 01:04:55,282
- No way.
- Way!

1009
01:04:55,365 --> 01:04:57,868
<i>I can't believe fuckin' Circle A
carries Italian Vogue.</i>

1010
01:04:57,910 --> 01:05:00,371
It doesn't. It's his own personal copy.

1011
01:05:00,412 --> 01:05:02,706
He'll let it go for 27 bucks.

1012
01:05:02,748 --> 01:05:04,625
27 bucks?

1013
01:05:04,708 --> 01:05:07,127
What the fuck do you care?
We're talking about per diem here.

1014
01:05:07,211 --> 01:05:10,089
<i>We found an issue of Italian Vogue
in Lebanon, Tennessee.</i>

1015
01:05:10,172 --> 01:05:12,091
We're lucky he's not asking
for fuckin' Krugerrands.

1016
01:05:12,174 --> 01:05:14,301
I'm getting it, and we're
splitting it three ways.

1017
01:05:14,385 --> 01:05:15,636
What, me, you, and Kim?

1018
01:05:15,719 --> 01:05:17,554
<i>Kim doesn't give
a shit about Italian Vogue.</i>

1019
01:05:17,596 --> 01:05:21,266
but Brandy'll come in with us,
and if she won't, Tisla, her sister, will.

1020
01:05:22,101 --> 01:05:25,104
Okay, but if anybody tears out
any sheets I want,

1021
01:05:25,145 --> 01:05:28,524
you gotta make color Xeroxes
of those pages, and I'm not talking Kinko's.

1022
01:05:28,607 --> 01:05:32,611
You take it to the art department
and have them do it fuckin' right.

1023
01:05:50,337 --> 01:05:52,631
Whoo!

1024
01:05:56,302 --> 01:05:57,511
Oh, my God!

1025
01:06:05,644 --> 01:06:07,062
Got it!

1026
01:06:16,655 --> 01:06:18,699
...the actress...

1027
01:06:30,169 --> 01:06:31,670
Oh, boy.

1028
01:06:34,673 --> 01:06:36,675
Your timing couldn't be better, Zoë.

1029
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:41,347
It just so happens we're all three
off-duty for the next three days.

1030
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:43,891
Fuckin' hell! How does that happen?

1031
01:06:43,974 --> 01:06:46,977
I'm doing Lindsay Lohan's makeup,
and she's off for the next three days.

1032
01:06:47,019 --> 01:06:49,897
There's no stunts being filmed
during that time so Kim's free,

1033
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:54,068
and Lee's on a will-notify
for the four days.

1034
01:06:54,151 --> 01:06:55,695
So how's the shoot going?

1035
01:06:55,778 --> 01:06:57,822
Great. We're having the best time.

1036
01:06:57,905 --> 01:06:59,990
The director, Cecil Evans, is so fun.

1037
01:07:00,074 --> 01:07:03,327
We're making the coolest movie
and partying all the time.

1038
01:07:03,369 --> 01:07:06,998
Hell, yeah. The next job
after this one is definitely gonna suck.

1039
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:08,958
So let's hear it, ladies.

1040
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:11,419
Set romances! Who's getting it off?

1041
01:07:11,502 --> 01:07:14,130
That would be Lee and Toolbox.

1042
01:07:14,213 --> 01:07:17,216
Oh, Toolbox!
Name sounds promising.

1043
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,427
- He's a grip.
- What he is is a pervert.

1044
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:21,804
Well, he just keeps sounding
better and better.

1045
01:07:23,055 --> 01:07:24,056
What's his perversion?

1046
01:07:26,183 --> 01:07:28,603
He likes to watch me pee.

1047
01:07:29,186 --> 01:07:33,649
# Lee is sitting on a toilet
and Toolbox is watching her pee #

1048
01:07:33,733 --> 01:07:35,776
# P-l-S-S-l-N-G #

1049
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:36,819
Ooh!

1050
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:38,863
Yeah, but not no more.

1051
01:07:38,946 --> 01:07:41,198
Now she's getting it on
with the Rock.

1052
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:43,117
You had a one-off with the Rock?

1053
01:07:43,201 --> 01:07:45,620
Well, not the real Rock.
He's this electrician named Bruce.

1054
01:07:45,703 --> 01:07:49,540
He looks like the Rock,
so we all just call him the Rock.

1055
01:07:49,582 --> 01:07:51,250
Oh, yeah, this is an all-star crew.

1056
01:07:51,334 --> 01:07:54,921
We got a guy who looks like Nic Cage
and Pee Wee Herman, too.

1057
01:07:55,004 --> 01:07:57,423
Kim, dick department.
Let's hear it!

1058
01:07:57,507 --> 01:08:00,885
Mm-mmm, no dick this trip.
I got a man.

1059
01:08:00,927 --> 01:08:04,180
- How long have you had this boyfriend?
- About three months.

1060
01:08:04,263 --> 01:08:05,890
Who'd you steal him from?

1061
01:08:05,932 --> 01:08:07,225
Nobody!

1062
01:08:07,308 --> 01:08:09,894
Kim!
- Wha... what?

1063
01:08:09,936 --> 01:08:11,604
He totally had a girlfriend.

1064
01:08:11,687 --> 01:08:15,316
All of Kim's boyfriends start out
as somebody else's boyfriend.

1065
01:08:15,399 --> 01:08:17,485
I did not steal him!

1066
01:08:17,568 --> 01:08:22,698
I didn't steal any of them;
they just... jumped ship.

1067
01:08:24,951 --> 01:08:28,704
- So what's your story, Abernathy?
- Oh, Abbie's got the big Kahuna.

1068
01:08:28,746 --> 01:08:31,499
<i>I had a set crush on Cecil.</i>

1069
01:08:31,582 --> 01:08:34,919
Set crush? Nigga, please.
You were his set wife!

1070
01:08:34,961 --> 01:08:37,213
"Were" and "had" being
the key words, here.

1071
01:08:37,296 --> 01:08:39,966
Bitch, you two are still
into each other and you know it.

1072
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:45,096
Yeah, well, if he's so in love with me,
why did he fuck Darryl Hannah's stand-in?

1073
01:08:48,683 --> 01:08:52,353
Yes, men are dogs.
Oh, it's so funny!

1074
01:08:52,437 --> 01:08:53,896
Oh, it's so funny!

1075
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:56,482
Stop acting all hurt.
Your ass just mad.

1076
01:08:56,566 --> 01:08:58,359
Yeah, he's a stand-in fucker.

1077
01:08:58,443 --> 01:09:01,404
You need to get over that shit.
That was two weeks ago.

1078
01:09:01,446 --> 01:09:04,407
Oh, well, now you put it like that...

1079
01:09:05,283 --> 01:09:07,660
Oh, I haven't told you the best part.

1080
01:09:07,744 --> 01:09:10,830
He fucked her on my birthday.

1081
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:13,750
Oh, that's a horse of a different color.

1082
01:09:13,791 --> 01:09:16,669
- Thank you.
- Did he know it was your birthday?

1083
01:09:16,753 --> 01:09:19,464
I mean, he's the director.
He's kind of busy.

1084
01:09:19,547 --> 01:09:23,968
He ate a piece of my birthday cake,
and he got me a present.

1085
01:09:24,052 --> 01:09:26,054
- Wow.
- Yeah... I think he knew.

1086
01:09:27,722 --> 01:09:29,224
What did he get you?

1087
01:09:32,810 --> 01:09:34,270
He made me a tape.

1088
01:09:34,437 --> 01:09:36,064
He made you a tape?

1089
01:09:36,147 --> 01:09:38,358
Wait, he didn't burn you a CD?

1090
01:09:38,441 --> 01:09:39,817
He made you a tape?

1091
01:09:39,859 --> 01:09:42,862
- Yeah.
- Oh, that is so romantic!

1092
01:09:42,946 --> 01:09:46,032
Yes, I know what you 're gonna say,
so don't even go there.

1093
01:09:46,115 --> 01:09:48,117
This sounds like the test
of true love to me.

1094
01:09:48,201 --> 01:09:51,913
Look, I know you guys like him.
He's likeable.

1095
01:09:51,996 --> 01:09:54,582
But he fucked another woman
on my birthday.

1096
01:09:54,666 --> 01:09:57,001
How can you not be on my side?

1097
01:09:57,085 --> 01:09:58,586
I admit, that sounds bad.

1098
01:09:58,670 --> 01:09:59,921
It is bad!

1099
01:10:00,004 --> 01:10:02,841
It just sounds like there's
a little more to it than that.

1100
01:10:02,924 --> 01:10:04,092
Were you two fucking?

1101
01:10:04,175 --> 01:10:05,635
Hell, no.

1102
01:10:05,718 --> 01:10:07,595
Hello, is your name Abernathy?

1103
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:08,638
Sorry.

1104
01:10:08,721 --> 01:10:12,308
The answer to your question
is no, of course not.

1105
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:15,353
<i>What do you mean "No, of course not"?</i>

1106
01:10:15,437 --> 01:10:18,440
The reason Cecil hasn't had
a girlfriend in six years

1107
01:10:18,523 --> 01:10:21,818
is because girls will fuck him,
and if you fuck Cecil,

1108
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:24,154
you don't become one
of his girlfriends...

1109
01:10:24,195 --> 01:10:27,157
not to say I want to be his girlfriend,

1110
01:10:27,198 --> 01:10:32,412
but if I did want to be his girlfriend,
if I fucked him, I wouldn't be.

1111
01:10:32,495 --> 01:10:38,168
I'd be one of his regulars,
and I'm getting too fuckin' old for that shit.

1112
01:10:38,209 --> 01:10:41,421
- Have you let him do anything?
- Yes!

1113
01:10:43,131 --> 01:10:45,050
I've let him give me a foot massage,

1114
01:10:45,091 --> 01:10:48,970
and when we go to the movies,
I've let him hold my hand.

1115
01:10:49,054 --> 01:10:51,765
Bitch, you might be actin'
like you 12 years old,

1116
01:10:51,848 --> 01:10:53,350
but he just acting like a man.

1117
01:10:53,433 --> 01:10:55,518
You need to break
that nigga off a piece.

1118
01:10:55,602 --> 01:10:56,936
Let me get this straight...

1119
01:10:57,979 --> 01:11:01,274
you 're not fucking him,
you 're not sucking him,

1120
01:11:01,358 --> 01:11:05,236
you 're not giving him any tongue,
but Darryl Hannah's stand-in is?

1121
01:11:05,278 --> 01:11:07,447
Can we just take my sex life
off the table?

1122
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:10,909
Actually, it was Cecil's sex life
that was on the table...

1123
01:11:10,951 --> 01:11:12,619
and your lack of one.

1124
01:11:18,416 --> 01:11:20,794
Fuck both of you
and your little high-five.

1125
01:11:20,877 --> 01:11:25,298
<i>Before you can claim a nigga,
you got to claim a nigga,</i>

1126
01:11:25,382 --> 01:11:28,260
and you can start by giving
that motherfucker a hand job

1127
01:11:28,343 --> 01:11:30,053
in the back of the van
on Tuesday.

1128
01:11:30,136 --> 01:11:31,304
I'm not gonna do that!

1129
01:11:31,388 --> 01:11:33,932
I know you won't!
But you know who will...

1130
01:11:34,015 --> 01:11:36,977
the bitch that ends up living
in that big-ass mansion of his.

1131
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:40,105
I haven't entirely agreed
with everything Kim's said,

1132
01:11:40,188 --> 01:11:43,984
but it is true if you 've stretched it out
like you have with Cecil

1133
01:11:44,067 --> 01:11:48,613
and you suddenly get dirty on them,
it blows their mind.

1134
01:11:49,948 --> 01:11:53,410
So Zoë, Kim, and I are
in the Philippines at an outdoor rave.

1135
01:11:53,452 --> 01:11:56,788
<i>What were you working on?
- Three Kicks to the Head. Part Three.</i>

1136
01:11:56,872 --> 01:12:00,292
And, admittedly,
we're a little fucked up.

1137
01:12:00,375 --> 01:12:02,627
Cheers to that.
- Word.

1138
01:12:03,336 --> 01:12:04,588
Cheers.

1139
01:12:04,629 --> 01:12:06,173
So Zoë...

1140
01:12:07,299 --> 01:12:11,178
the genius, wants to take
a picture of me.

1141
01:12:12,304 --> 01:12:15,724
It's dark as hell,
and you can't see shit.

1142
01:12:15,807 --> 01:12:19,436
So she's got her camera
and keeps saying, "Step back a little!"

1143
01:12:19,478 --> 01:12:20,562
So I do.

1144
01:12:20,645 --> 01:12:22,939
Then "A little fu -ther!"

1145
01:12:23,023 --> 01:12:27,694
So I step back a little fu -ther.
Then "A little more!" So I do.

1146
01:12:27,778 --> 01:12:33,700
Then I realize I'm at the edge
of a seven-foot concrete ditch...

1147
01:12:33,784 --> 01:12:36,203
...with God knows how many rocks

1148
01:12:36,286 --> 01:12:40,499
and broken bottles and rats in it,
and if I fell in that fucking thing,

1149
01:12:40,582 --> 01:12:42,584
I probably would have broken my neck.

1150
01:12:42,668 --> 01:12:46,380
So I am yelling at her:
"Zoë, you almost killed me!"

1151
01:12:48,048 --> 01:12:52,094
So we laugh about it
and walk a little further,

1152
01:12:52,177 --> 01:12:54,680
and Zoë starts fuckin' around.

1153
01:12:54,763 --> 01:12:58,850
And... bam! ...if she doesn't fall
in the fucking ditch!

1154
01:13:00,352 --> 01:13:02,104
Nice.

1155
01:13:02,187 --> 01:13:04,815
Thank you. Yep. Thank you.

1156
01:13:05,941 --> 01:13:08,402
I remember taking a step
and looking down,

1157
01:13:08,485 --> 01:13:12,030
just as I'm thinking, "There's that ditch
Abbie was talking about."

1158
01:13:12,114 --> 01:13:14,491
Bam! I'm in the fucking ditch, you know.

1159
01:13:14,533 --> 01:13:15,909
What happened?

1160
01:13:15,993 --> 01:13:18,328
What, with Zoë, the cat?

1161
01:13:18,412 --> 01:13:19,454
Nothing.

1162
01:13:19,538 --> 01:13:23,500
If I fell in that fuckin' thing, they would
have had to helicopter me out of there.

1163
01:13:23,584 --> 01:13:25,878
Zoë just lands on her feet.

1164
01:13:25,961 --> 01:13:30,090
But then later I started feeling
a little bad about myself...

1165
01:13:30,174 --> 01:13:35,220
Zoë falls in the ditch and it's nothing.
We're laughing about it.

1166
01:13:35,304 --> 01:13:39,641
If I fell in that fucking thing,
I probably would have been paralyzed.

1167
01:13:39,683 --> 01:13:41,977
Oh, honey, you can't think like that.

1168
01:13:42,019 --> 01:13:45,856
We all have our individual talents,
and that just happens to be one of Zoë's.

1169
01:13:45,939 --> 01:13:50,444
Well, physically speaking,
Zoë is amazing.

1170
01:13:50,527 --> 01:13:53,197
I mean, agility, reflexes, nimbleness?

1171
01:13:54,031 --> 01:13:57,159
There's few human beings that can fuck
with Zoë on that front.

1172
01:13:57,201 --> 01:13:59,244
Kim, I like you too.

1173
01:14:00,204 --> 01:14:04,666
Having said that, before you get
too envious of Zoë's prowess,

1174
01:14:04,708 --> 01:14:07,461
you 're missing the most
important part of that story.

1175
01:14:07,544 --> 01:14:11,048
You didn't fall in the ditch.
Zoë did.

1176
01:14:11,131 --> 01:14:15,052
Zoë even knew there was a ditch there
because you told her,

1177
01:14:15,094 --> 01:14:17,012
and she still fell in.

1178
01:14:17,054 --> 01:14:20,182
So Lee's right.
We all have our talents.

1179
01:14:20,224 --> 01:14:23,352
Hey, I resemble that remark.

1180
01:14:26,563 --> 01:14:28,691
So Kim, you still pack a Roscoe?

1181
01:14:31,944 --> 01:14:33,779
Check it out, bitch.

1182
01:14:33,862 --> 01:14:36,240
- Ooh, nice one, mate.
- I know this.

1183
01:14:36,281 --> 01:14:37,491
What's a Roscoe?

1184
01:14:37,574 --> 01:14:38,867
Roscoe's a pistol.

1185
01:14:39,702 --> 01:14:41,620
- You carry a gun?
- Uh-huh.

1186
01:14:41,704 --> 01:14:43,706
You have a license to carry?

1187
01:14:43,747 --> 01:14:47,668
Yeah, when I became a Secret Service
agent, they gave me a license.

1188
01:14:48,419 --> 01:14:50,212
Oh, I didn't know you were...

1189
01:14:52,965 --> 01:14:57,052
Okay, I didn't say it, all right?
Stop looking at me. God.

1190
01:14:58,137 --> 01:15:00,097
Did you know Kim carried a gun?

1191
01:15:00,139 --> 01:15:04,226
Yes. Now, do I approve? No.

1192
01:15:04,268 --> 01:15:06,312
Do I know? Yes.

1193
01:15:06,395 --> 01:15:10,065
Look, I don't know what
futuristic utopia you live in,

1194
01:15:10,107 --> 01:15:12,985
but the world I live in,
a bitch need a gun.

1195
01:15:13,068 --> 01:15:16,655
You can't get around the fact
that people who carry guns

1196
01:15:16,739 --> 01:15:19,450
tend to get shot
more than people who don't.

1197
01:15:19,533 --> 01:15:23,329
And you can't get around the fact
that if I go down to the laundry room

1198
01:15:23,412 --> 01:15:26,290
at midnight enough times,
I might get my ass raped.

1199
01:15:26,373 --> 01:15:28,083
Don't do your laundry at midnight.

1200
01:15:28,125 --> 01:15:31,837
Fuck that! I wanna do my laundry
whenever the fuck I want to.

1201
01:15:31,921 --> 01:15:36,175
There are other things you can carry
other than a gun. Pepper spray.

1202
01:15:36,258 --> 01:15:40,721
Uh, motherfucker trying to rape me,
I don't want to give him a skin rash.

1203
01:15:40,805 --> 01:15:42,598
I wanna shut that nigga down!

1204
01:15:44,475 --> 01:15:46,685
How about a knife, at least?

1205
01:15:46,769 --> 01:15:49,188
Yeah, you know what happens
to motherfuckers carry knives?

1206
01:15:51,107 --> 01:15:52,983
They get shot!

1207
01:15:53,067 --> 01:15:57,113
If I ever become a famous actress,
I won't carry a gun.

1208
01:15:57,154 --> 01:16:00,825
I'll hire me a do-dirt nigga and he'll
carry the gun, and when shit goes down,

1209
01:16:00,908 --> 01:16:04,328
I'll sit back and laugh,
but until that day, it's Wild West.

1210
01:16:04,370 --> 01:16:07,957
So Zoë, you thought about
what you want to do first?

1211
01:16:09,667 --> 01:16:13,295
It just so happens
I know exactly what I want to do.

1212
01:16:13,337 --> 01:16:16,799
Oh, really?
And what would that be?

1213
01:16:16,841 --> 01:16:21,554
To me, there's no point in being in America
unless you can drive a Detroit muscle car.

1214
01:16:21,637 --> 01:16:25,891
I wanna drive a Dodge Challenger...
fuck me swinging, balls out.

1215
01:16:28,853 --> 01:16:31,439
Well, I guess we
could talk to Transpo,

1216
01:16:31,522 --> 01:16:33,899
but does it have to be
a Dodge Challenger?

1217
01:16:33,983 --> 01:16:38,446
Not just that. It has to be a 1970
Dodge Challenger with a 440 engine.

1218
01:16:42,450 --> 01:16:45,578
How in the fuck
do you expect to do that?

1219
01:16:45,661 --> 01:16:46,996
No worries, mate.

1220
01:16:47,038 --> 01:16:49,290
I've got it all worked out.

1221
01:16:49,373 --> 01:16:52,585
When I knew I was coming here,
I went online and found out

1222
01:16:52,668 --> 01:16:56,130
<i>that the local paper here in Tennessee
is the Lebanon News Sentinel.</i>

1223
01:16:56,214 --> 01:16:58,966
- So back home...
- I'm sorry, where's home? Australia?

1224
01:17:01,511 --> 01:17:03,679
What do you mean by that, mate?

1225
01:17:03,763 --> 01:17:06,849
Zoë's from New Zealand,
and you never...

1226
01:17:06,891 --> 01:17:10,353
I repeat, never...
call a Kiwi an Aussie.

1227
01:17:10,436 --> 01:17:13,147
That is, unless
you want your ass kicked.

1228
01:17:15,066 --> 01:17:16,859
I'm so sorry. I will nev...

1229
01:17:18,069 --> 01:17:19,612
Oh, it's okay.

1230
01:17:19,695 --> 01:17:22,782
We're just taking the piss
out of you, mate.

1231
01:17:22,865 --> 01:17:26,035
Auckland, to answer your question.

1232
01:17:26,077 --> 01:17:29,163
Anyway, I subscribed
to the local paper a month ago.

1233
01:17:29,247 --> 01:17:32,834
Why the fuck you want a local redneck
newspaper in New Zealand?

1234
01:17:32,917 --> 01:17:35,378
Pipe down and I'll tell you.

1235
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:38,381
I've been getting the paper
and checking the classifieds,

1236
01:17:38,423 --> 01:17:40,007
looking at cars for sale,

1237
01:17:40,091 --> 01:17:44,762
so as of yesterday,
for sale in this town,

1238
01:17:44,846 --> 01:17:48,099
some dude is selling
a stock 1970 Dodge Challenger

1239
01:17:48,182 --> 01:17:51,936
with a 440 engine and a white paint job.

1240
01:17:52,019 --> 01:17:53,813
And you wanna buy it?

1241
01:17:55,106 --> 01:17:58,735
Kim, I may be stupid,
but I'm not bloody stupid.

1242
01:17:58,818 --> 01:18:02,864
I wanna say I wanna buy it
so he'll let me test-drive it.

1243
01:18:02,905 --> 01:18:06,034
A 1970 Dodge Challenger
with a white paint job?

1244
01:18:06,117 --> 01:18:07,702
Oh, uh, Kowalski!

1245
01:18:07,744 --> 01:18:11,539
<i>Kowalski from Vanishing Point.
Mate, it's a fucking classic!</i>

1246
01:18:11,581 --> 01:18:13,041
If I can get this guy

1247
01:18:13,082 --> 01:18:16,961
to let me drive it without him,
I will blow the doors off that bitch.

1248
01:18:17,045 --> 01:18:18,921
<i>What's Vanishing Point?</i>

1249
01:18:20,006 --> 01:18:21,966
<i>What's Vanishing Point?</i>

1250
01:18:22,050 --> 01:18:25,011
Abs, I'm supposed
to be the illiterate one.

1251
01:18:25,094 --> 01:18:28,056
It's just one of the best
American movies ever made.

1252
01:18:28,097 --> 01:18:31,643
<i>Actually, Zoë, most girls
wouldn't know Vanishing Point.</i>

1253
01:18:32,685 --> 01:18:36,731
Excuse me. Most girls?
What the fuck are you two?

1254
01:18:36,773 --> 01:18:40,276
Yeah, well, we're gearheads.
Of course we watched it.

1255
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:42,737
<i>Y'all grew up watching
that Pretty in Pink shit.</i>

1256
01:18:42,779 --> 01:18:45,114
<i>Oh, I liked Pretty in Pink.</i>

1257
01:18:45,198 --> 01:18:47,659
What, so you didn't watch
John Hughes movies?

1258
01:18:47,742 --> 01:18:51,746
Of course I did. I'm a girl.
But I also watched car shit, too...

1259
01:18:51,829 --> 01:18:54,541
<i>Vanishing Point. Dirty Mary Crazy Larry.</i>

1260
01:18:54,624 --> 01:18:56,167
<i>- Gone in 60 Seconds...
- Oh...</i>

1261
01:18:56,251 --> 01:18:59,212
The real one, not that
Angelina Jolie bullshit.

1262
01:18:59,295 --> 01:19:03,007
<i>We have an outdoor theater in Auckland
that plays Vanishing Point.</i>

1263
01:19:03,091 --> 01:19:05,760
<i>Big Wednesday. all the classics.</i>

1264
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:24,279
What do you horny gals want?

1265
01:19:27,866 --> 01:19:31,161
Yeah, you got
a 1970 Dodge Challenger for sale?

1266
01:19:31,244 --> 01:19:32,704
Right up here, ladies.

1267
01:19:47,344 --> 01:19:50,388
This shit is off the fuckin' hook!

1268
01:19:50,472 --> 01:19:52,891
Fuckin' legendary, mate.

1269
01:19:55,143 --> 01:20:00,482
Sweet ass. Well, if you 'll excuse me,
I'd like to have a word with my associate.

1270
01:20:00,523 --> 01:20:02,025
You ladies take your time.

1271
01:20:08,865 --> 01:20:11,952
What are you waiting for?
Ask him to let you drive it by yourself.

1272
01:20:12,035 --> 01:20:14,621
I intend to, but first I need
to ask you something.

1273
01:20:14,704 --> 01:20:15,789
What?

1274
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:20,377
If he lets us take it out on our own,
I wanna play Ship's Mast.

1275
01:20:21,127 --> 01:20:22,837
- Oh, hell, no!
- Keep it down!

1276
01:20:22,921 --> 01:20:24,881
Ain't no way I'm doing Ship's Mast.

1277
01:20:24,923 --> 01:20:26,132
- For Chrissakes...
- Don't blaspheme.

1278
01:20:26,216 --> 01:20:27,175
Sorry.

1279
01:20:27,259 --> 01:20:30,011
Now, what did you say
after the last time?

1280
01:20:30,095 --> 01:20:33,348
- Look, I know what I said.
- What did you say?

1281
01:20:33,431 --> 01:20:35,517
- I know I said we shouldn't...
- No.

1282
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:38,603
You didn't say we shouldn't.
You said we ain't ever gonna do that again.

1283
01:20:38,687 --> 01:20:40,438
- But...
- But, my ass!

1284
01:20:40,522 --> 01:20:43,525
You said not only are we never
gonna play Ship's Mast again,

1285
01:20:43,608 --> 01:20:46,695
but you also said if you ever do
what you trying to do now,

1286
01:20:46,736 --> 01:20:51,658
to not only refuse, but that I had permission
to physically restrain your ass if necessary.

1287
01:20:51,741 --> 01:20:54,411
Now, did you or did you not say that?

1288
01:20:54,494 --> 01:20:57,747
No, no, no.
Answer the question, motherfucker.

1289
01:20:57,831 --> 01:21:01,251
- Did you or did you not say that?
- Yes, I said that.

1290
01:21:01,334 --> 01:21:03,253
- However...
- Whatever with your "however."

1291
01:21:03,336 --> 01:21:07,257
Look, I know I said it,
and I know I meant it...

1292
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:08,550
Damn skippy you meant it!

1293
01:21:08,633 --> 01:21:11,344
<i>But when I said it,
I didn't mean in America!</i>

1294
01:21:11,428 --> 01:21:13,430
- Oh, nigga, please.
- For real. Really.

1295
01:21:13,513 --> 01:21:17,559
I meant we should never play Ship's Mast
again in New Zealand or Australia.

1296
01:21:17,601 --> 01:21:19,311
You are such a liar!

1297
01:21:19,394 --> 01:21:24,983
I know what I said, but when I said it
I didn't know I'd ever come to America,

1298
01:21:25,067 --> 01:21:28,445
and if I had of known
I was gonna come to America,

1299
01:21:28,528 --> 01:21:32,199
<i>had the opportunity to play Ship's Mast
on the Vanishing Point Challenger...</i>

1300
01:21:32,282 --> 01:21:34,409
I would have added a "however."

1301
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:36,161
Right?

1302
01:21:41,625 --> 01:21:43,919
Okay, oddly enough,
I actually understood that.

1303
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:48,840
However, just because
you talked yourself into some stupid shit

1304
01:21:48,924 --> 01:21:51,051
doesn't mean I have lost
my goddamn mind.

1305
01:21:51,134 --> 01:21:54,346
You need two people to play Ship's Mast,
and I ain't playing.

1306
01:22:01,895 --> 01:22:04,022
I'll be your best friend.

1307
01:22:04,106 --> 01:22:06,984
I don't need me no best friend
lives on the other side of Planet Earth.

1308
01:22:07,067 --> 01:22:08,360
I'll crack your back.

1309
01:22:08,443 --> 01:22:09,903
You 'll crack it anyway.

1310
01:22:09,987 --> 01:22:12,698
Well, of course I'll crack it anyway.

1311
01:22:12,781 --> 01:22:16,451
But now, while I'm here,
I'll be your back-cracking slave.

1312
01:22:16,493 --> 01:22:19,204
Whenever you want it, you 've got it.
You don't even have to ask.

1313
01:22:19,288 --> 01:22:22,749
You just order me to do it, just be like,
"Bitch, get over here and get busy."

1314
01:22:29,965 --> 01:22:34,386
You crack my back, give me foot massages,
and after a shower, you moisturize my butt.

1315
01:22:35,637 --> 01:22:36,638
Deal.

1316
01:22:38,473 --> 01:22:41,268
We're gonna see if this guy'll let us
take the car out without him.

1317
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:44,313
If he does, you wait here with Lee
and we'll be back in a moment.

1318
01:22:44,897 --> 01:22:45,898
What?

1319
01:22:45,981 --> 01:22:50,360
- I said we're gonna see if this guy'll let...
- I heard what you said.

1320
01:22:50,444 --> 01:22:53,822
I just can't believe
what you said.

1321
01:22:55,157 --> 01:22:56,992
You two got some fuckin' balls.

1322
01:22:57,034 --> 01:22:58,494
What?

1323
01:22:58,535 --> 01:23:00,037
Don't play dumbass with me.

1324
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:05,125
I've been up all night, I'm still a little drunk,
and I have a hangover.

1325
01:23:05,167 --> 01:23:08,879
I should be in my hotel room, asleep,
not fuckin' around on Tobacco Road,

1326
01:23:08,962 --> 01:23:12,758
<i>but because Zoë wanted to drive
some Vanishing Point car, I'm here.</i>

1327
01:23:12,841 --> 01:23:16,804
Now you two got the balls to ask me...
no, scratch that... tell me

1328
01:23:16,845 --> 01:23:21,350
I gotta go make conversation with Tom Joad
while the cool kids get to go out and play?

1329
01:23:21,433 --> 01:23:23,227
Bullshit on that.

1330
01:23:23,310 --> 01:23:25,312
- It ain't like that.
- What's it like, Kim?

1331
01:23:25,396 --> 01:23:29,316
You guys are our collateral.
He's never gonna go for it if we all go.

1332
01:23:29,358 --> 01:23:33,028
I really think one human being
will be collateral enough.

1333
01:23:33,862 --> 01:23:35,864
You 're not gonna
want to do what we're doing.

1334
01:23:35,906 --> 01:23:37,241
What, drive a car?

1335
01:23:38,283 --> 01:23:39,368
We're doing more than that.

1336
01:23:39,451 --> 01:23:41,161
What, drive it fast?

1337
01:23:42,538 --> 01:23:44,206
We're doing more than that.

1338
01:23:44,289 --> 01:23:48,836
Actually, we're paying you a compliment,
'cause we gonna do some stupid shit.

1339
01:23:50,713 --> 01:23:53,340
But that's okay. We're stunt people.
We ain't got good sense.

1340
01:23:53,382 --> 01:23:55,843
But you got good sense,
and anybody with good sense

1341
01:23:55,884 --> 01:23:58,887
- ain't gonna want to do what we're doing.
- How do you know?

1342
01:23:58,929 --> 01:24:01,015
'Cause you 're a mum.

1343
01:24:01,056 --> 01:24:02,391
Yeah.

1344
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:07,897
You know, we're supposed
to be this big posse,

1345
01:24:07,938 --> 01:24:11,859
but that's the excuse you guys use
whenever you want to exclude me,

1346
01:24:11,901 --> 01:24:14,778
so what is it you two daredevils are doing

1347
01:24:14,862 --> 01:24:19,116
that I'm just so uncool
I couldn't possibly understand?

1348
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:21,577
You know, we're kind of conning this guy,

1349
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:25,372
so maybe it's best if we don't go
into detail about it while he's watching us.

1350
01:24:25,414 --> 01:24:26,415
Besides...

1351
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:30,336
he's probably not gonna
let us do it, anyway.

1352
01:24:33,214 --> 01:24:36,300
Okay, how about this?

1353
01:24:37,092 --> 01:24:40,262
I'll talk him into it,
but I go along.

1354
01:24:41,430 --> 01:24:44,225
- How you gonna do that?
- That's my problem.

1355
01:24:45,017 --> 01:24:46,185
But don't worry.

1356
01:24:47,061 --> 01:24:49,105
He'll say yes.

1357
01:24:49,188 --> 01:24:51,315
What are you gonna do, blow him?

1358
01:24:51,398 --> 01:24:52,566
No.

1359
01:24:53,943 --> 01:24:56,445
I'm gonna insinuate
that Lee's gonna blow him.

1360
01:25:00,616 --> 01:25:02,326
That's a good one.

1361
01:25:02,410 --> 01:25:03,786
Not really.

1362
01:25:04,787 --> 01:25:08,082
But let me handle it.
We got a deal?

1363
01:25:12,461 --> 01:25:13,838
Okay, Mama, listen up.

1364
01:25:13,921 --> 01:25:17,633
You wanna hang with the cool kids?
You got to be cool.

1365
01:25:17,717 --> 01:25:20,553
We take you along, you don't say shit.
You don't even say crap.

1366
01:25:20,636 --> 01:25:23,639
You just sit in the back, and I don't want
to hear a peep, you understand?

1367
01:25:23,723 --> 01:25:25,141
- Got it.
- I'm serious, now.

1368
01:25:25,182 --> 01:25:29,020
You start nagging us, we pulling over,
kicking you out, and picking you up later.

1369
01:25:29,103 --> 01:25:30,438
Agreed.

1370
01:25:34,483 --> 01:25:37,528
Okay. Go work your magic.

1371
01:25:44,076 --> 01:25:45,661
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

1372
01:25:45,745 --> 01:25:47,371
- Hello, what's your name?
- Jasper.

1373
01:25:47,455 --> 01:25:49,123
Hello, Jasper, I'm Abernathy.

1374
01:25:49,206 --> 01:25:50,833
- Aber what?
- Abernathy.

1375
01:25:50,917 --> 01:25:53,336
- What's your first name?
- That is my first name.

1376
01:25:53,377 --> 01:25:56,756
- What kind of first name is that?
- Just call me Abbie.

1377
01:25:56,839 --> 01:25:58,382
Okay, Abbie.

1378
01:25:59,508 --> 01:26:03,137
Jasper, we were wondering
if my friends and I could take the car out

1379
01:26:03,221 --> 01:26:06,265
for a little test drive out on our own,
just to see if we're comfortable.

1380
01:26:06,349 --> 01:26:08,100
Why would I do something
stupid like that?

1381
01:26:08,184 --> 01:26:10,478
To better sell your automobile.

1382
01:26:10,561 --> 01:26:12,772
How do I know y'all ain't
just gonna steal it?

1383
01:26:12,855 --> 01:26:14,774
Four reasons, actually.

1384
01:26:14,857 --> 01:26:19,570
One, we're not thieves,
two, that would be rude,

1385
01:26:19,654 --> 01:26:22,323
three, we're staying
at the Days Inn in town...

1386
01:26:22,365 --> 01:26:25,993
you can call, check with management.
We're registered for the next month.

1387
01:26:26,035 --> 01:26:30,706
Actually, Zoë's not, but Kim and I are,
so we're totally track-downable.

1388
01:26:30,790 --> 01:26:32,500
Who's Kim? The colored girl?

1389
01:26:33,334 --> 01:26:36,921
Yes. Kim would be the girl of color.

1390
01:26:37,004 --> 01:26:39,382
And reason number four...
and the most important:

1391
01:26:39,465 --> 01:26:42,385
while we're taking the car out
for a little spin,

1392
01:26:42,468 --> 01:26:46,889
that'll give you a better opportunity
to get acquainted with our other friend...

1393
01:26:47,765 --> 01:26:48,933
Lee.

1394
01:26:52,228 --> 01:26:54,355
Why does she look
kind of familiar?

1395
01:26:54,397 --> 01:26:57,400
That would be because
she's a famous actress.

1396
01:26:57,483 --> 01:26:58,484
Hmm.

1397
01:26:59,444 --> 01:27:00,945
Why's she dressed like that?

1398
01:27:01,029 --> 01:27:04,198
Well, you see, we're making
a Hollywood movie in town,

1399
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:07,201
and it's a cheerleader movie,
and she's one of the cheerleaders.

1400
01:27:07,243 --> 01:27:08,911
What's a cheerleader movie?

1401
01:27:08,995 --> 01:27:10,747
A movie about cheerleaders.

1402
01:27:11,998 --> 01:27:13,207
Is it a porno movie?

1403
01:27:15,001 --> 01:27:21,591
Yes, it is, but don't mention it. She's shy.

1404
01:27:25,219 --> 01:27:27,930
Lee, this is Jasper.
Jasper, Lee.

1405
01:27:28,014 --> 01:27:30,725
Now, you two kids
stay out of trouble.

1406
01:27:30,808 --> 01:27:33,811
Hey, good-looking.
Be back to pick you up later.

1407
01:27:33,895 --> 01:27:35,229
Ta-ta!

1408
01:27:45,573 --> 01:27:46,991
Gulp.

1409
01:28:01,548 --> 01:28:02,966
You thinking what I'm thinking?

1410
01:28:04,634 --> 01:28:06,052
I think I'm thinking it.

1411
01:28:06,094 --> 01:28:07,595
What are you and you thinking?

1412
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:11,015
I'm thinking we told your ass
to shut the fuck up.

1413
01:28:13,685 --> 01:28:15,770
- Where y'all going?
- You stay put.

1414
01:28:15,854 --> 01:28:17,188
I gotta take a...

1415
01:28:34,497 --> 01:28:36,291
So, you ready to do this?

1416
01:28:37,834 --> 01:28:38,918
You sure?

1417
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:43,631
Well, I always don't want to do it
right before I'm gonna do it.

1418
01:28:43,715 --> 01:28:46,134
I know what you mean,
'cause I don't wanna do it.

1419
01:28:46,217 --> 01:28:47,343
Kim!

1420
01:28:47,427 --> 01:28:50,096
- I'm just saying.
- If you 're gonna take the piss out of it...

1421
01:28:50,138 --> 01:28:51,806
I'm just saying.

1422
01:28:53,266 --> 01:28:54,893
You wanna start out on top?

1423
01:28:56,311 --> 01:28:59,647
Practically doesn't count
if you start on the top.

1424
01:29:05,153 --> 01:29:06,321
Here are your gloves.

1425
01:29:13,495 --> 01:29:16,039
No, no, no, no.
I'm wearing a jacket.

1426
01:29:16,122 --> 01:29:17,874
This is my jacket.

1427
01:29:17,958 --> 01:29:21,252
Um, ain't you supposed to be
my slave or some shit?

1428
01:29:22,337 --> 01:29:25,590
- Come on.
- I'm the one who's on the bonnet.

1429
01:29:25,674 --> 01:29:28,134
Bonnet, my ass.
You on the hood.

1430
01:29:37,477 --> 01:29:39,771
Y'all, I think I hear a car coming.

1431
01:29:39,854 --> 01:29:41,022
Give me your belt.

1432
01:29:45,485 --> 01:29:50,824
This is my cute shit.
Fuck that. Get Abernathy's belt.

1433
01:29:52,659 --> 01:29:54,494
Fine, we'll use Abbie's belt.

1434
01:29:59,833 --> 01:30:02,627
- Give me your belt.
- No. Prada.

1435
01:30:02,711 --> 01:30:04,337
Come on, give her the belt.

1436
01:30:04,379 --> 01:30:08,133
- Magic word.
- Please give her the belt?

1437
01:30:09,176 --> 01:30:10,635
Just 'cause you asked nicely.

1438
01:30:13,388 --> 01:30:15,265
It's nice to be nice, Kim!

1439
01:30:15,348 --> 01:30:17,184
Whatever.

1440
01:30:17,225 --> 01:30:21,646
You know what?
Don't think about asking me to do your hair.

1441
01:30:21,730 --> 01:30:24,149
- Your ass gonna do it.
- You 'll ask "pretty please," bitch,

1442
01:30:24,232 --> 01:30:27,068
because that's what you do when no one
else is looking. You ain't that hard.

1443
01:30:27,152 --> 01:30:29,071
- I ain't getting...
- Abernathy.

1444
01:30:29,154 --> 01:30:31,156
Don't get on my nerves right now.

1445
01:30:31,239 --> 01:30:33,658
- I got shit on my mind.
Ooh!

1446
01:30:33,742 --> 01:30:35,827
You know, I ain't six.

1447
01:30:48,757 --> 01:30:51,134
It's cold. Can we roll up
one of these windows?

1448
01:30:51,218 --> 01:30:52,386
KIM and ZOË: No.

1449
01:30:53,929 --> 01:30:56,682
Okay, Abernathy. Check this out.

1450
01:31:08,443 --> 01:31:10,195
What the fuck are you guys doing?

1451
01:31:19,413 --> 01:31:20,831
What does that mean?

1452
01:31:22,874 --> 01:31:25,377
Whoa!

1453
01:31:29,298 --> 01:31:32,676
Faster, you black bitch! Faster!

1454
01:31:39,975 --> 01:31:42,269
That fast enough for your bony ass?

1455
01:31:42,352 --> 01:31:44,104
Whoo-hoo!

1456
01:31:44,146 --> 01:31:46,732
Whoa ho ho ho!

1457
01:31:46,773 --> 01:31:47,774
Oh!

1458
01:31:50,110 --> 01:31:52,613
Abernathy, get your ass up here.

1459
01:31:57,284 --> 01:32:00,454
Whoa! Whoo-hoo!

1460
01:32:00,496 --> 01:32:02,080
Alrighty.

1461
01:32:02,164 --> 01:32:04,333
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1462
01:32:16,804 --> 01:32:18,305
Go, go! Go!

1463
01:32:18,347 --> 01:32:21,058
Check it out, bitch.
You want it fucking faster?

1464
01:32:35,447 --> 01:32:36,657
Whoo-hoo!

1465
01:32:36,740 --> 01:32:38,701
Yah hoo hoo!

1466
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:39,785
##

1467
01:32:47,710 --> 01:32:49,795
Yah hoo hoo!

1468
01:33:36,550 --> 01:33:40,262
- Oh, my God.
- What the fuck? Shit.

1469
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:47,269
Damn it!

1470
01:33:56,237 --> 01:33:57,363
Now.

1471
01:33:58,739 --> 01:34:01,075
Did you do something to him?
Say something?

1472
01:34:01,117 --> 01:34:03,327
Nothing! Shit.

1473
01:34:03,410 --> 01:34:05,204
Here he comes, Zoë.
He's coming!

1474
01:34:05,246 --> 01:34:06,372
Aah!

1475
01:34:08,582 --> 01:34:09,834
Shit, oh shit!

1476
01:34:09,917 --> 01:34:11,335
No!

1477
01:34:12,211 --> 01:34:13,587
Hold on, Zoë!

1478
01:34:22,805 --> 01:34:24,765
Oh, my God. Zoë!

1479
01:34:24,974 --> 01:34:27,184
- Oh! Hold on!
- I can't!

1480
01:34:30,980 --> 01:34:32,732
Fuck you, motherfucker!

1481
01:34:34,442 --> 01:34:37,737
Zoë! Zoë!

1482
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:41,240
- I'm sorry I called you a black bitch!
- I forgive you. Hold the fuck on!

1483
01:34:41,282 --> 01:34:43,409
Whoa, whoa, get away!

1484
01:34:45,786 --> 01:34:48,414
Oh, shit.
I can't see. I can't see!

1485
01:34:48,497 --> 01:34:49,832
Zoë, move your leg!

1486
01:34:53,628 --> 01:34:55,546
Oh! Come on, come on!

1487
01:34:59,091 --> 01:35:02,595
Redneck lunatic bastard!
Get away from me!

1488
01:35:02,678 --> 01:35:03,679
fucking legs!

1489
01:35:08,267 --> 01:35:10,269
Oh, my God.

1490
01:35:20,530 --> 01:35:23,449
Shit, I'm scared, Kim.
I'm really scared.

1491
01:35:23,491 --> 01:35:24,951
I know, baby, just hold on.

1492
01:35:24,992 --> 01:35:26,869
Watch your feet!

1493
01:35:29,330 --> 01:35:30,581
You wanna get hot?

1494
01:35:30,665 --> 01:35:32,500
- Fucking son of a bitch!
- You wanna get hot?

1495
01:35:33,668 --> 01:35:36,087
Then suck on this for a while, bitch!

1496
01:35:39,173 --> 01:35:41,592
Zoë! Goddamn it!

1497
01:36:07,577 --> 01:36:10,288
Oh, my God. Get away from us,
you cocksucker!

1498
01:36:10,329 --> 01:36:11,831
Leave us alone!

1499
01:36:11,873 --> 01:36:15,168
Fuck you, motherfucker!
Fuck you!

1500
01:36:19,464 --> 01:36:22,342
Zoë! Zoë! Oh, Zoë!

1501
01:36:23,551 --> 01:36:25,303
Hold on!

1502
01:36:47,408 --> 01:36:48,826
Zoë! Zoë!

1503
01:36:56,918 --> 01:36:58,002
Look out!

1504
01:37:26,573 --> 01:37:29,325
Get ready to fly, bitch.

1505
01:37:33,163 --> 01:37:34,831
- Zoë!
- Zoë, hold on!

1506
01:37:41,754 --> 01:37:43,715
He's right on your fucking ass!

1507
01:37:59,606 --> 01:38:01,191
Hey! Whoo-hoo!

1508
01:38:02,108 --> 01:38:05,862
Hey, ladies, that was fun.

1509
01:38:10,241 --> 01:38:12,744
<i>Well, adios.</i>

1510
01:38:12,786 --> 01:38:15,080
Ow! Fuck!

1511
01:38:16,498 --> 01:38:17,957
Shit! Fuck!

1512
01:38:19,668 --> 01:38:22,253
Run away with your ass!

1513
01:38:23,380 --> 01:38:25,548
You better run, motherfucker!

1514
01:38:31,054 --> 01:38:32,681
That bitch!

1515
01:38:48,530 --> 01:38:49,656
I'm okay!

1516
01:38:49,739 --> 01:38:52,951
Oh, shit! Goddamn it!

1517
01:38:53,034 --> 01:38:55,620
Oh, you fuckin' bitch!

1518
01:38:55,662 --> 01:38:59,332
Of course you are.
Of course you are. What was I thinking?

1519
01:39:00,667 --> 01:39:03,753
What was I thinking?
Zoë, the fucking cat!

1520
01:39:07,841 --> 01:39:09,843
Whew. That was a close one.

1521
01:39:13,180 --> 01:39:15,974
So, where's the maniac?

1522
01:39:16,016 --> 01:39:18,894
I shot him and his punk ass sped off.

1523
01:39:20,020 --> 01:39:22,272
You wanna go get him?

1524
01:39:22,355 --> 01:39:24,357
Oh, hell yeah!

1525
01:39:24,441 --> 01:39:25,442
Honey...

1526
01:39:26,318 --> 01:39:28,278
I think you might want to get out.

1527
01:39:29,404 --> 01:39:30,864
Fuck that shit.

1528
01:39:32,115 --> 01:39:33,992
Let's kill this bastard.

1529
01:39:35,994 --> 01:39:38,330
Okay, get your ass in the back.
Let's go.

1530
01:39:44,544 --> 01:39:46,004
Where the fuck you going?

1531
01:39:46,088 --> 01:39:47,089
I'll be back!

1532
01:39:55,389 --> 01:39:58,141
This'll smart. Sweet. Let's go.

1533
01:39:58,225 --> 01:40:01,978
Oh, fuck yeah, bitch.
Come on. Bring that shit.

1534
01:40:04,147 --> 01:40:05,399
Giddy-up, then!

1535
01:40:13,740 --> 01:40:15,158
Yeah!

1536
01:40:46,356 --> 01:40:47,566
God!

1537
01:40:59,036 --> 01:41:01,538
Come on! Come on.

1538
