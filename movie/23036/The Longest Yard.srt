1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,568
...nails Harrison, and drags him down
as if he were gonna hog-tie him, too.

2
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:13,569
JB Logan helped out.

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,730
Anderson's ninth tackle,
he has two behind the line of scrimmage.

4
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:20,406
Give Harrison four yards
to the twenty-six.

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,823
Stoney Walker's coming in
and Rufus Middleton is going out,

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,534
giving Middleton a breather.

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,415
Boy, has he been burning up
a few miles today on stadium turf.

8
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:32,915
Rufus Middleton. All right,
it's second and six on the twenty-six.

9
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:37,545
Stoney Walker deployed wide right, Larry
Singer left. The line is set. The snap...

10
00:00:37,762 --> 00:00:40,633
How long do we have to keep
watching this crap?

11
00:00:40,849 --> 00:00:43,304
...tumbled down
on the twenty-three. A quick trap.

12
00:00:43,518 --> 00:00:47,053
He had room to run except
for that man from Jacksonville,

13
00:00:47,272 --> 00:00:51,270
James Washington La Croix,
who made a good, sure, low tackle,

14
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:54,521
just as Harrison was about to spurt
deep into the secondary.

15
00:00:54,738 --> 00:00:57,573
We've had quite an exciting
ball game this afternoon...

16
00:00:57,782 --> 00:01:03,618
Only a moron could sit and watch
two football games one after the other.

17
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,155
Victorio covers him there.
Singer left.

18
00:01:06,374 --> 00:01:08,331
It's about time
Robinson went to Singer.

19
00:01:08,543 --> 00:01:11,295
Harrison and Mancuso
are split behind Robinson.

20
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:14,291
Robinson gives instead to Harrison,
up the middle again.

21
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:17,876
He may have the first down,
he's close to the 20-yard line.

22
00:01:18,094 --> 00:01:19,968
Let's see where they mark the ball.

23
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,925
Billy Jacoby and Sonny Anderson again
making the tackle. It's going to be...

24
00:01:25,143 --> 00:01:28,429
Thank God.

25
00:01:30,398 --> 00:01:35,606
That feels so good.
I feel so relaxed.

26
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,902
You know the help is off, Crewe.

27
00:01:39,115 --> 00:01:41,024
The phones are off.

28
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,820
We're all alone.

29
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:49,824
Let's get it on, honey. Come on.

30
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:54,122
- Honey.
- What?

31
00:01:54,339 --> 00:01:58,668
Wake up, baby. Come on.
You know it'll be good.

32
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:02,586
You know how good it is.
Come on, Crewe.

33
00:02:02,806 --> 00:02:04,715
Get off me!

34
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,812
Son of a bitch.

35
00:02:18,613 --> 00:02:20,273
Where are you going?

36
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,574
- Splitting.
- Splitting?

37
00:02:24,786 --> 00:02:29,781
You split when I tell you to split,
you All-American son of a bitch.

38
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:31,909
Lovely, lovely.

39
00:02:35,505 --> 00:02:38,292
And when you walk out, stay out.

40
00:02:38,508 --> 00:02:40,880
You're too expensive to be useless.

41
00:02:46,224 --> 00:02:47,552
Whore!

42
00:02:48,643 --> 00:02:55,310
- That's exactly what you are, a whore.
- I never looked at it that way before.

43
00:02:55,525 --> 00:02:57,482
Everybody's bought you.

44
00:02:57,694 --> 00:03:01,145
Colleges, the pros, your gamblers.

45
00:03:01,364 --> 00:03:03,689
Who bought those
beautiful caps on your teeth,

46
00:03:03,908 --> 00:03:06,744
the clothes you're wearing
and the bloody tan you've got?

47
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,447
Me!

48
00:03:09,748 --> 00:03:13,033
Have I ever neglected to thank you,
Melissa?

49
00:03:13,251 --> 00:03:14,959
You has-been.

50
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:16,790
Where're your keys?

51
00:03:17,005 --> 00:03:21,049
If I took everything back... Forget
my keys! You'd be bare-assed naked.

52
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:25,339
- Where're your goddamn keys?
- Don't touch my keys.

53
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:31,345
I think the love
has gone out of our relationship.

54
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:33,055
Bastard.

55
00:03:35,106 --> 00:03:37,644
Don't you take my Masseratti.

56
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:40,184
I earned it.

57
00:03:44,532 --> 00:03:48,482
I told you not to touch
my goddamn car!

58
00:04:24,489 --> 00:04:25,817
Police.

59
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:24,250
- Do you have a driver's licence?
- What, are you taking a poll?

60
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:30,081
Well, look what we got here.
A miniature cop.

61
00:07:33,094 --> 00:07:34,838
Can we see your driver's licence?

62
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,050
What?

63
00:07:37,265 --> 00:07:39,673
Can we see your driver's licence?

64
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:43,096
See if I can get it out.

65
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,860
It's him all right.

66
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,109
Why'd you dump her car in the Bay?

67
00:07:52,322 --> 00:07:55,239
- What?
- Why'd you dump her car in the Bay?

68
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,119
I couldn't find a car wash.

69
00:08:07,504 --> 00:08:09,128
Step away from the bar.

70
00:08:11,049 --> 00:08:13,754
Mister, step away from the bar!

71
00:08:13,968 --> 00:08:16,839
Don't get pushy, cowboy.

72
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:23,889
- Turn it around.
- Come on!

73
00:08:31,027 --> 00:08:33,981
- Hold that son of a bitch!
- Damn!

74
00:08:34,197 --> 00:08:38,242
Now we got you
for stealing a car, drunken driving,

75
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:41,203
drunk in public and resisting arrest.

76
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:48,202
- Want something else?
- Yeah. I'm going to make you taller.

77
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:37,382
OK, men, let's go.

78
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,450
Good afternoon.
Where are you from?

79
00:10:04,662 --> 00:10:08,363
- Palm Beach County.
- Thank you, sir. Second door down.

80
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,329
This way, men.

81
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:14,493
They gave you $10,000
for shaving off your moustache on TV?

82
00:10:17,592 --> 00:10:20,165
How about giving me $5,000 worth?

83
00:10:22,013 --> 00:10:27,600
Coming right off: There's about
twenty-five hundred, three thousand,

84
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:29,519
four thousand coming up,

85
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:32,101
five thousand!

86
00:10:43,451 --> 00:10:46,121
- Anything else, sir?
- That's it.

87
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:33,834
Warden Hazen thinks
you're pretty hot stuff.

88
00:11:35,045 --> 00:11:37,618
But I'm Captain Knauer.

89
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,252
I'm going to spell
things out for you. I run this prison.

90
00:11:42,927 --> 00:11:45,798
He sits there growing old.
I'm out here busting heads.

91
00:11:46,723 --> 00:11:48,715
And I run the football team.

92
00:11:49,184 --> 00:11:51,971
- What football team?
- My football team.

93
00:11:52,896 --> 00:11:54,224
Oh.

94
00:11:55,065 --> 00:11:58,019
Now, Hazen's going to ask you
to help coach.

95
00:11:58,234 --> 00:12:00,856
And you just tell him, "No way".

96
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,496
Know something?

97
00:12:14,626 --> 00:12:16,702
I don't like you.

98
00:12:18,213 --> 00:12:20,585
You understand that?

99
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,708
Oh, yeah.

100
00:12:25,261 --> 00:12:30,137
Attention Cell Block 3 A. Please report
as scheduled to your period assignment,

101
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,757
except for carpentry
and accounting classes.

102
00:12:32,977 --> 00:12:38,564
All men assigned to farm detail will
meet at one o'clock in the Rotunda.

103
00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:44,027
Warden, Captain Knauer's here
with inmate Crewe.

104
00:12:44,781 --> 00:12:48,067
- Send him in.
- Thank you, sir.

105
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:53,664
- You can go in now.
- Thank you, Miss Toot.

106
00:13:08,596 --> 00:13:10,470
Paul Crewe.

107
00:13:11,808 --> 00:13:13,717
The Wrecking Crewe.

108
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:20,266
- It's good to have you here.
- Thank you.

109
00:13:23,778 --> 00:13:27,858
Young people can learn a great deal
from a skilful football game.

110
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:32,736
Offence, defence,
spirit of achievement, teamwork.

111
00:13:37,876 --> 00:13:40,082
You might say...

112
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:49,720
...the game embodies
what has made our country great.

113
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:54,049
It's a great game.
It's played by great men.

114
00:13:57,312 --> 00:14:03,813
We have something of a football team
here ourselves, you know.

115
00:14:05,528 --> 00:14:09,111
First rank, semi-pro,
South-eastern League.

116
00:14:09,324 --> 00:14:12,775
Runner-up, National Champions,
past five years.

117
00:14:14,204 --> 00:14:18,153
Mister Crewe,
what do you think of semi-pro ball?

118
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,497
Semi-pro's a joke.

119
00:14:24,756 --> 00:14:31,090
Well, perhaps we could use
a few pointers from the big leagues.

120
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:36,180
Captain, what do you say
to Mister Crewe here looking in,

121
00:14:36,393 --> 00:14:39,393
giving us the benefit
of his invaluable knowledge?

122
00:14:39,938 --> 00:14:45,359
That's a real good idea, Warden.
We could use all the help we can get.

123
00:14:46,277 --> 00:14:48,021
Well?

124
00:14:48,238 --> 00:14:52,449
I haven't held a football in eight
years. I'm not in very good shape.

125
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:55,529
Nobody's asked you to play,
Mister Crewe.

126
00:14:55,745 --> 00:15:00,538
What we need is a coach. New blood.

127
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,542
New game plan.

128
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:12,548
Anybody who was pro football's
Most Valuable Player is special,

129
00:15:12,762 --> 00:15:15,514
and I want to have that.

130
00:15:17,392 --> 00:15:19,384
I'm not interested in football anymore.

131
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,687
Mister Crewe, I don't mind saying,

132
00:15:28,486 --> 00:15:31,060
I pulled a lot of strings
to get you down here.

133
00:15:32,115 --> 00:15:33,609
I appreciate that.

134
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,193
Look.

135
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:39,661
What I want is a national title.

136
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:45,085
If, perchance, you should help us
achieve that goal,

137
00:15:45,295 --> 00:15:50,170
I expect your stay here
with us will be very agreeable.

138
00:15:51,676 --> 00:15:53,005
Well?

139
00:15:57,098 --> 00:16:01,226
I just want to do my time,
then get out of here.

140
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,764
Very well.

141
00:16:10,195 --> 00:16:15,189
All right, I'll turn you over
to the good hands of Captain Knauer.

142
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,068
Swamp reclamation.

143
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:21,747
Get him out of here.

144
00:16:25,668 --> 00:16:27,994
- Captain.
- Yes, sir.

145
00:16:28,213 --> 00:16:30,086
I'd like a word with you.

146
00:16:32,842 --> 00:16:37,884
For the past five years,
you've promised me the national title,

147
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:40,470
and every year,
you've come up short.

148
00:16:40,684 --> 00:16:44,302
- I try, sir.
- When I want an answer, I'll indicate.

149
00:16:44,521 --> 00:16:46,394
Yes, sir.

150
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,350
You've asked for bonus money.

151
00:16:48,566 --> 00:16:51,437
Certainly take their football
seriously, don't they?

152
00:16:51,903 --> 00:16:56,067
This year you've asked for new
game uniforms. I've OK'ed them.

153
00:16:56,741 --> 00:16:58,817
Everything you've asked for,
I've given you.

154
00:16:59,035 --> 00:17:01,870
Yes, sir. And I appreciate it, sir.

155
00:17:03,373 --> 00:17:05,864
I want that title.

156
00:17:06,084 --> 00:17:09,453
You'll give me that title,
or you'll be out of a job.

157
00:17:09,671 --> 00:17:13,170
You and all that
over-priced beef you call a team.

158
00:17:13,383 --> 00:17:16,170
We should be
in the Superbowl by now!

159
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:21,217
I've lost patience! The gravy train is
over! This year you're going to win!

160
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:22,808
You've lovely hair.

161
00:17:23,018 --> 00:17:28,059
...your last chance! Prison is no
different from any other community.

162
00:17:28,857 --> 00:17:31,893
Ever find any spiders in it?

163
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,103
...then I haven't done my job.

164
00:17:34,612 --> 00:17:36,771
I'm not being unreasonable, am I?

165
00:17:37,699 --> 00:17:40,368
- No, sir.
- Then you'll give me the title?

166
00:17:40,577 --> 00:17:43,032
- Yes, sir.
- Good!

167
00:17:44,581 --> 00:17:47,072
I want that man out there.

168
00:17:47,292 --> 00:17:52,369
And I want you to make
that son of a bitch enthusiastic!

169
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:58,333
- Ever do it standing up?
- Let's move it.

170
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:10,470
- I say forget football, you do it.
- Why are you so mad?

171
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:16,563
- You better start taking life seriously.
- I did exactly what you told me to do.

172
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:39,338
Hey, Superstar.
Get a good night's sleep?

173
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,794
Too bad you missed breakfast.
It was yummy!

174
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:44,425
Gotta get it done.

175
00:18:44,641 --> 00:18:49,766
- This is make-work day.
- What's make-work day?

176
00:18:49,979 --> 00:18:52,305
You shovel it in
and shovel back out again.

177
00:18:52,524 --> 00:18:55,774
Hustle in there now.
Cover that bank.

178
00:18:55,985 --> 00:18:58,441
Get that wheelbarrow, Woody.

179
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,072
Let's go. Single file.

180
00:19:01,282 --> 00:19:05,232
Hang it up, hang it up.
Let's get covered.

181
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:10,247
All right, let's go. Come on.

182
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,367
Get a shovel.

183
00:19:15,171 --> 00:19:16,630
Hey, Superstar.

184
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,301
I got an idea. Granny.

185
00:19:28,685 --> 00:19:31,805
You ever work with a nigger before?

186
00:19:35,358 --> 00:19:37,185
Get another shovel there, boy.

187
00:19:44,075 --> 00:19:46,697
All right. Let's go.

188
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,535
Heave it up!

189
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:59,794
- Sitting down, boss?
- Not today, boy.

190
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,927
- Wiping off, boss?
- Not today, boy.

191
00:20:11,686 --> 00:20:14,521
- Rolling one, boss?
- Not yet, boy.

192
00:20:15,774 --> 00:20:18,810
Now you know
how black man's work feels.

193
00:20:19,027 --> 00:20:20,569
How do you like it?

194
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:23,020
Oh, it sort of grows on you.

195
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:24,864
No talking there, Granny.

196
00:20:25,617 --> 00:20:30,243
- Yes, boss.
- You'll find yourselves in bad time.

197
00:20:30,455 --> 00:20:34,453
Yes, boss. Sorry about that, boss.

198
00:20:34,918 --> 00:20:37,669
What's he think this is, good time?

199
00:20:37,879 --> 00:20:42,422
Looky, looky, looky,
here comes cooky!

200
00:20:49,766 --> 00:20:54,594
Big deal. Look at him now.

201
00:20:57,399 --> 00:21:00,649
How do you like them apples,
Superstar?

202
00:21:04,447 --> 00:21:05,989
Move the line.

203
00:21:52,454 --> 00:21:54,493
Real friendly types
you got around here.

204
00:21:54,706 --> 00:21:58,573
- Might be your own fault.
- Oh, really?

205
00:21:58,793 --> 00:22:02,791
Most of these old boys have nothing.
Never had nothing to start with.

206
00:22:03,006 --> 00:22:06,790
But you, you had it all.

207
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:10,593
Then you let your team-mates down,
got caught taking bribes.

208
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:14,515
- I did, did I?
- I ain't saying either way.

209
00:22:14,726 --> 00:22:17,395
I'm just saying
you could've robbed banks, sold dope,

210
00:22:17,604 --> 00:22:21,269
stole your grandmother's pension,
and none of us would've minded.

211
00:22:21,483 --> 00:22:26,192
But shaving points off a football game,
that's un-American.

212
00:22:29,532 --> 00:22:31,608
You take football
real serious down here.

213
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:36,035
- Mind if I ask you one question?
- Yeah, I do.

214
00:22:36,247 --> 00:22:38,323
Why'd you do it?

215
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:43,417
- It's a long story.
- Well, I got eight years.

216
00:22:54,849 --> 00:22:58,301
Oh, my God.
What the hell is that?

217
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,434
That's a member
of the warden's football team.

218
00:23:02,649 --> 00:23:06,563
Some of these guards are not
just everyday run-of-the-mill guards.

219
00:23:09,864 --> 00:23:13,198
Crewe! Granville! Front and centre.

220
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,568
What now?

221
00:23:15,787 --> 00:23:20,283
That means we don't get
to finish this delicious lunch.

222
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,130
What's he looking for?

223
00:23:34,472 --> 00:23:36,014
Snakes.

224
00:23:36,224 --> 00:23:38,596
- Snakes?
- Yeah.

225
00:23:47,902 --> 00:23:50,191
Take five!

226
00:23:59,372 --> 00:24:03,417
- Rolling one, boss?
- Not today, boy.

227
00:24:09,841 --> 00:24:11,300
Jeez!

228
00:24:25,357 --> 00:24:28,607
- Terrific.
- Football faggot!

229
00:24:31,696 --> 00:24:35,196
- Salt pill up here, boss?
- Go get it, boy.

230
00:24:36,034 --> 00:24:38,240
How long you been in this asylum,
Pop?

231
00:24:38,453 --> 00:24:40,113
Thirty-four years.

232
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,536
- Thirty-four years?
- Yep.

233
00:24:42,749 --> 00:24:45,999
Last six and a half
right here in the swamp.

234
00:24:46,211 --> 00:24:49,745
Too old for reclamation,
so they made me barracks chief.

235
00:24:50,673 --> 00:24:53,544
Aren't you coming up
for parole soon?

236
00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:00,178
Thirty years ago, I made the mistake
of slugging a fish bull. Hazen.

237
00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:04,227
Just my luck he made warden.

238
00:25:04,437 --> 00:25:10,772
Sent me out here when I was 64 to die,
but I've been hanging on.

239
00:25:10,985 --> 00:25:15,897
We'll all be in the same place a thousand
years from now, so what the hell.

240
00:25:16,116 --> 00:25:19,485
Yeah. What the hell.

241
00:25:21,996 --> 00:25:25,994
All right, you assholes.
Back to work.

242
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:31,169
Hey!

243
00:25:32,716 --> 00:25:36,630
This ain't no country club, Superstar.
Move your ass.

244
00:25:43,643 --> 00:25:47,593
No, no, son.
You've got to get off the bunk.

245
00:25:47,814 --> 00:25:50,850
Man, for God's sake, get up.

246
00:25:52,485 --> 00:25:54,193
On your feet.

247
00:25:54,404 --> 00:26:00,691
Listen to me. Nobody's allowed on the
bunks till five minutes before lights out.

248
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,574
They'll put you in the oven.

249
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:09,366
Man, that can kill you.

250
00:26:11,421 --> 00:26:14,256
Did you have any supper yet?

251
00:26:14,466 --> 00:26:15,960
No.

252
00:26:16,176 --> 00:26:18,501
Later I'll try to get you some chow.

253
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,255
You got to eat, man,
or you'll die of mono.

254
00:26:22,891 --> 00:26:25,512
And they could care less.

255
00:26:34,569 --> 00:26:36,941
- Get off me!
- Hey, watch it, man!

256
00:26:37,155 --> 00:26:39,029
Where the hell you going?

257
00:26:40,492 --> 00:26:44,026
Twinkle, twinkle, little Superstar.

258
00:26:49,584 --> 00:26:51,244
- Guard.
- Yeah?

259
00:26:51,461 --> 00:26:55,209
I want to see the warden.

260
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:09,513
Pass the salt.

261
00:27:58,069 --> 00:28:00,026
Boy.

262
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,698
Come on.

263
00:29:56,229 --> 00:29:58,138
Go, baby!

264
00:30:40,982 --> 00:30:45,359
That's going to get you
twenty-four hours in the hot box, boy.

265
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,522
I quit.

266
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:00,784
What makes you so tough?

267
00:31:01,544 --> 00:31:04,462
I don't know. It just comes natural.

268
00:31:05,882 --> 00:31:08,207
That'll cost you, boy.

269
00:31:28,154 --> 00:31:29,946
Rise and shine.

270
00:31:30,448 --> 00:31:32,240
Rise and shine.

271
00:31:38,873 --> 00:31:42,207
Oh. It's room service.

272
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:44,376
Pretty gamey.

273
00:31:47,215 --> 00:31:51,427
Shower and put on some clean whites.
The warden wants to see you.

274
00:31:51,636 --> 00:31:55,254
- The warden?
- Get on down there.

275
00:32:09,904 --> 00:32:11,529
Well?

276
00:32:12,198 --> 00:32:15,532
- What do you think of my team?
- Mean.

277
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:18,076
Crude, but mean.

278
00:32:18,621 --> 00:32:22,702
I was depending on you, you know.

279
00:32:22,917 --> 00:32:28,292
Well, there's so little time left now,
it's quite a problem.

280
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:32,882
They need something
before that first game.

281
00:32:35,305 --> 00:32:38,471
- You have to win the first game?
- Right.

282
00:32:38,683 --> 00:32:40,640
Well, it's relatively simple.

283
00:32:40,852 --> 00:32:44,766
Yeah. Get yourself a tune-up game,
you know?

284
00:32:44,981 --> 00:32:47,057
A what?

285
00:32:47,275 --> 00:32:52,780
A tune-up game, like the pros have,
with a hungry team not in your league.

286
00:32:52,989 --> 00:32:55,943
You bring them here
and kick the shit out of them.

287
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,238
Well.

288
00:33:00,622 --> 00:33:04,572
How do you think
we'd do against the pros?

289
00:33:04,793 --> 00:33:07,331
- That team against the pros?
- Yeah.

290
00:33:07,545 --> 00:33:10,831
You'd have a real problem.

291
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:16,292
Well, how do you think
we'd do against the cons?

292
00:33:17,722 --> 00:33:20,011
- I didn't know they had a team.
- They don't.

293
00:33:21,184 --> 00:33:24,304
But you've given me an inspiration.

294
00:33:24,521 --> 00:33:28,815
I've decided, Mister Crewe, that
you're going to put one together for me.

295
00:33:29,025 --> 00:33:32,311
For that little tune-up game, you know?

296
00:33:32,529 --> 00:33:35,648
And you're going to play quarterback.

297
00:33:36,741 --> 00:33:38,152
I can't.

298
00:33:38,368 --> 00:33:43,362
Why? They're semi-pro,
you said yourself. A big joke.

299
00:33:43,581 --> 00:33:46,915
That's why people like me around,
my sense of humour.

300
00:33:47,752 --> 00:33:53,257
Mister Crewe,
as old Mister Sam used to say,

301
00:33:53,466 --> 00:33:59,006
"In this institution,
to get along, you go along."

302
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:04,221
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

303
00:34:04,436 --> 00:34:08,564
I'm just going to do what's left
of my eighteen months quietly,

304
00:34:08,773 --> 00:34:10,398
and I'm out of here.

305
00:34:10,608 --> 00:34:14,357
Oh, yes. Eighteen months.

306
00:34:17,198 --> 00:34:20,235
But that is to make parole.

307
00:34:23,204 --> 00:34:26,075
That was before you struck
Captain Knauer.

308
00:34:27,751 --> 00:34:32,377
Your basic sentence
is from two to five years.

309
00:34:32,589 --> 00:34:34,747
You could be here a long time.

310
00:34:41,973 --> 00:34:47,015
If I get this team together, how long
do I have to get them organized?

311
00:34:47,228 --> 00:34:48,639
Four weeks.

312
00:34:50,774 --> 00:34:53,977
- We're talking about early parole?
- I believe we are.

313
00:35:00,658 --> 00:35:02,532
All right. I'll play.

314
00:35:03,787 --> 00:35:05,245
What? I didn't hear.

315
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:09,328
- I'll play.
- Sir.

316
00:35:10,585 --> 00:35:12,874
I'll play, sir.

317
00:35:15,215 --> 00:35:20,375
History. I read you
like a book, Mister Crewe.

318
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,341
One more thing.

319
00:35:23,556 --> 00:35:25,348
What is it?

320
00:35:25,558 --> 00:35:28,180
You keep Knauer off my back.

321
00:35:31,106 --> 00:35:33,679
Give us a game, Mister Crewe.

322
00:35:37,404 --> 00:35:39,527
I'll give you a game.

323
00:35:39,739 --> 00:35:41,150
"Hit and be hit".

324
00:35:41,366 --> 00:35:47,036
"Anyone with any experience
or desire. Prison football team sign-up".

325
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,332
- Well, what do you think?
- No!

326
00:35:50,542 --> 00:35:53,459
- Maybe I'll get annihilated. Forget it.
- He's right.

327
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,709
Now, wait a second. Hey!

328
00:35:55,922 --> 00:35:58,045
Here's how I look at it.

329
00:35:58,258 --> 00:36:00,713
Suppose you break your leg
or something.

330
00:36:00,927 --> 00:36:04,841
That's six weeks easy time in
the hospital. That's biscuits and gravy.

331
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:08,593
Tell me something.
Would they let me play tackle?

332
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:10,138
Sure.

333
00:36:10,353 --> 00:36:14,351
So I'd spend half the time looking
directly into Walking Boss's eyes?

334
00:36:14,566 --> 00:36:18,860
- Now you got it.
- I've always had a thing for him.

335
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:21,817
Walking Boss
always had a thing for you.

336
00:36:22,032 --> 00:36:25,863
Hold it! Don't you guys know
a good thing when you see it?

337
00:36:26,077 --> 00:36:30,324
You get a free crack at the guards,
even a chance to kill one.

338
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,411
- Legal!
- Bullshit! I ain't signing that damn thing.

339
00:36:33,626 --> 00:36:36,912
Come on, everybody.
When Rotka's right, he's right.

340
00:36:41,342 --> 00:36:44,094
This honky golden boy sold out
his own team-mates, didn't he?

341
00:36:44,304 --> 00:36:45,632
Damn sure did.

342
00:36:45,847 --> 00:36:47,923
- Did it once, he'll do it again.
- Right.

343
00:37:01,863 --> 00:37:03,191
Hi.

344
00:37:03,823 --> 00:37:05,152
Hi.

345
00:37:06,576 --> 00:37:09,660
- You know you're doing it all wrong?
- Yeah?

346
00:37:09,871 --> 00:37:13,322
Yeah. You'll never put
a team together with that bunch.

347
00:37:13,541 --> 00:37:15,867
Well, I appreciate the advice.

348
00:37:16,086 --> 00:37:18,707
I can help you.
I'm Nate Scarboro.

349
00:37:24,594 --> 00:37:28,010
- Nate Scarboro, Giants?
- Yeah.

350
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,009
- Step into my office.
- Thank you.

351
00:37:32,727 --> 00:37:36,392
- I'm Paul Crewe.
- Yeah, I know.

352
00:37:37,315 --> 00:37:39,308
- You made All Pro, didn't you?
- Right.

353
00:37:39,526 --> 00:37:42,230
- Why'd you quit?
- It was simple.

354
00:37:42,445 --> 00:37:45,897
Doc said, "Quit football or walking".
Too many knee operations.

355
00:37:46,116 --> 00:37:48,737
I figured walking was
better than sitting.

356
00:37:48,952 --> 00:37:51,110
Maybe I made the wrong choice.

357
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:57,083
You got about 15 guys worth a damn.
The rest... How long did Hazen give you?

358
00:37:58,753 --> 00:38:01,505
- A month.
- Oh, you bought a bill of goods!

359
00:38:01,715 --> 00:38:03,541
Didn't have any choice.

360
00:38:04,134 --> 00:38:06,091
You don't have one black player.

361
00:38:06,302 --> 00:38:09,506
There are at least 15 here with
enough experience to make this club.

362
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,926
None signed up.

363
00:38:13,101 --> 00:38:16,801
I played eleven years in
the league, never even got a hangnail.

364
00:38:17,022 --> 00:38:19,263
I'm not going to get hurt in this game.

365
00:38:19,482 --> 00:38:22,816
I'm getting the biggest guys I can
and surrounding myself.

366
00:38:23,028 --> 00:38:25,400
I've watched the guards play
for eleven years.

367
00:38:25,613 --> 00:38:27,820
I've seen how they won
and why they lost.

368
00:38:29,075 --> 00:38:32,824
I know those bums
better than they know themselves.

369
00:38:34,122 --> 00:38:37,372
You just got yourself a job.
Head coach.

370
00:38:40,045 --> 00:38:41,788
Great bunch of guys you got.

371
00:38:42,547 --> 00:38:45,963
"Strangled both wives with panty hose".

372
00:38:46,176 --> 00:38:49,876
"Triple murder
including body dismemberment".

373
00:38:50,096 --> 00:38:52,172
"Hacked mother with meat cleaver".

374
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,719
Charming.

375
00:38:53,933 --> 00:38:57,018
Double-check the ones with two stars.
They're the most violent.

376
00:38:57,228 --> 00:38:58,639
Got any three-stars?

377
00:39:02,525 --> 00:39:05,645
Damn it, Warden,
I think this game's a big mistake.

378
00:39:05,862 --> 00:39:11,651
Captain, not only will you have the
chance to hone our team to a fine edge,

379
00:39:11,868 --> 00:39:15,118
you'll also have the opportunity
to learn a great deal about life.

380
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:19,280
Why is it, do you suppose,

381
00:39:19,501 --> 00:39:21,956
that I can walk through this yard,

382
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:24,743
surrounded by hate,

383
00:39:24,964 --> 00:39:27,337
and in total command?

384
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:33,339
Because you've got fifteen gun turrets
all around you that say you can.

385
00:39:36,935 --> 00:39:38,263
Partly, partly.

386
00:39:39,229 --> 00:39:45,184
They could grab us right now
and slit our throats, but they don't.

387
00:39:45,402 --> 00:39:50,147
We get the right person, right place,
right time, we can surprise them.

388
00:39:50,365 --> 00:39:54,197
One game, one time. We can do it.

389
00:39:54,411 --> 00:39:57,162
Hey, you guys about through?
Time's almost up.

390
00:39:57,372 --> 00:39:58,700
OK, Pop. Hold on.

391
00:39:59,374 --> 00:40:02,541
You better hurry up.
What have you got for me, Sunshine?

392
00:40:03,628 --> 00:40:06,914
I can get you steroids, vitamins,
greenies, anything you want.

393
00:40:07,132 --> 00:40:09,171
I'm the best hustler in the joint.

394
00:40:10,385 --> 00:40:13,884
How much of what he says
can he do?

395
00:40:14,097 --> 00:40:16,386
He can get you laid in here.

396
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:18,888
With a woman.

397
00:40:19,561 --> 00:40:23,261
- What more can I tell you?
- Oh, yeah?

398
00:40:23,481 --> 00:40:25,770
But can you get me
the guards' medical files?

399
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,816
- What for?
- To find out who's had broken bones.

400
00:40:31,948 --> 00:40:34,902
Sonny Tannen, strong as an ox.
You'll love him.

401
00:40:36,161 --> 00:40:38,912
- That him?
- That's him.

402
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:46,375
Hello, Sonny.
How'd you like to play some football?

403
00:40:46,588 --> 00:40:49,257
Football?

404
00:40:50,216 --> 00:40:51,545
Would you like that?

405
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,757
You mean, we'd really
get to hit the guards?

406
00:40:55,972 --> 00:40:57,680
You like that, Sonny?

407
00:41:03,396 --> 00:41:06,481
Report to the practice field
tomorrow morning, nine o'clock.

408
00:41:11,821 --> 00:41:13,481
Cool it!

409
00:41:19,496 --> 00:41:21,073
- What's his name?
- Indian.

410
00:41:21,289 --> 00:41:26,165
- That makes sense.
- Now, don't do any ethnic jokes.

411
00:41:32,425 --> 00:41:35,510
- Indian, this is Paul Crewe.
- Hi.

412
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,843
I hear you play some football.

413
00:41:38,056 --> 00:41:39,965
- Little bit.
- Where?

414
00:41:40,183 --> 00:41:43,054
- Oklahoma State.
- Oklahoma State U?

415
00:41:43,269 --> 00:41:45,974
- Prison.
- Yeah.

416
00:41:46,189 --> 00:41:49,523
First, we get you out of here
and on the football team.

417
00:41:49,734 --> 00:41:51,063
How?

418
00:41:56,074 --> 00:41:58,861
Well, we'll work on it.

419
00:42:02,872 --> 00:42:05,494
That pretty heavy?

420
00:42:08,461 --> 00:42:09,837
About 400 pounds.

421
00:42:10,672 --> 00:42:12,000
That's pretty heavy.

422
00:42:12,215 --> 00:42:16,129
George Samson Granada.
Mister Florida 1964.

423
00:42:17,345 --> 00:42:18,804
Paul Crewe.

424
00:42:19,013 --> 00:42:20,887
- You know Florida?
- Yeah.

425
00:42:21,099 --> 00:42:25,310
Yeah, they got tough cops here.
Small, but tough.

426
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,438
We're getting up a football game
against the guards.

427
00:42:28,648 --> 00:42:34,153
Wondered if you and some of your
buddies here would like to join in.

428
00:42:34,362 --> 00:42:37,233
With the guards?

429
00:42:39,075 --> 00:42:40,404
I'd like that.

430
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,993
- Sign him up.
- I'm way ahead of you.

431
00:42:45,206 --> 00:42:47,911
- See you around.
- Look forward to it.

432
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:54,457
Samson, huh?

433
00:42:56,509 --> 00:42:58,502
- Samson.
- Don't cut your hair.

434
00:42:59,262 --> 00:43:01,255
What do you think?

435
00:43:01,473 --> 00:43:05,173
Defensively, we can hold them
to two or three touchdowns.

436
00:43:05,393 --> 00:43:09,521
But we need better pass receiving
and more speed to win.

437
00:43:13,651 --> 00:43:15,110
To win?

438
00:43:16,988 --> 00:43:20,820
I'm just talking about surviving.
Who's talking about winning?

439
00:43:21,034 --> 00:43:26,490
So am I. This isn't just
a football game to the warden.

440
00:43:26,706 --> 00:43:30,241
He shows you and this team up,
he's showing up all the prisoners.

441
00:43:32,087 --> 00:43:33,711
It's just a game.

442
00:43:34,798 --> 00:43:38,712
All I want is to survive it.
It's just a game.

443
00:43:38,927 --> 00:43:44,169
Not to him it isn't.
It's a fear and violence philosophy:

444
00:43:44,391 --> 00:43:47,178
A chance to be free
for a few hours,

445
00:43:47,394 --> 00:43:52,850
to try and be men again,
so he can destroy us.

446
00:43:53,942 --> 00:43:57,441
Nate, if you're thinking
about winning the game,

447
00:43:57,654 --> 00:43:59,362
you're as crazy as he is.

448
00:43:59,948 --> 00:44:01,442
Maybe so.

449
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:06,409
But you spend 14 years in this tank

450
00:44:06,621 --> 00:44:12,624
and you realise there's only two things
they can't sweat or beat out of you.

451
00:44:12,836 --> 00:44:14,378
Your balls.

452
00:44:15,505 --> 00:44:19,372
Better hang onto them because they're
all you'll have when you get out.

453
00:44:31,229 --> 00:44:33,222
- Goodnight, Nate.
- Goodnight.

454
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:38,861
Use of toilet facilities is suspended
for two hours until repairs are complete.

455
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:40,695
Sorry, men.

456
00:45:10,268 --> 00:45:12,391
- Mace.
- Yeah.

457
00:45:12,604 --> 00:45:14,810
Follow my lead.
We're going to do this sucker.

458
00:45:15,023 --> 00:45:19,151
Yeah, we got a line-up, we'd jam him.

459
00:45:19,361 --> 00:45:22,278
Yeah, let's go
see what this boy wants.

460
00:45:23,615 --> 00:45:27,482
Pretty boy, we know what you want.
We don't play no ball.

461
00:45:29,788 --> 00:45:32,907
- Figured you did.
- We do but we don't.

462
00:45:33,124 --> 00:45:35,876
There it is.

463
00:45:37,253 --> 00:45:41,500
- Weren't you two drafted by the pros?
- The pros.

464
00:45:41,716 --> 00:45:45,714
I understand that, but we no longer
perform for the honkies' amusement.

465
00:45:45,929 --> 00:45:48,052
Hey, man, I'll play.

466
00:45:49,557 --> 00:45:51,515
But guarantee me that I'll start.

467
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:55,181
- You got it.
- All right.

468
00:45:55,397 --> 00:45:58,101
What's wrong with you, nigger?
We don't fuck with them.

469
00:45:58,858 --> 00:46:01,859
- I'm going to play football.
- But not with them honkies.

470
00:46:02,654 --> 00:46:04,646
You better leave. We'll talk later.

471
00:46:06,032 --> 00:46:11,193
Yeah, leave. You look better
going than you did coming, anyway.

472
00:46:11,413 --> 00:46:13,701
What's wrong with you?

473
00:46:13,915 --> 00:46:15,955
I'm going to play football.

474
00:46:16,167 --> 00:46:19,204
- Look, brother...
- I ain't your goddamn brother.

475
00:46:19,421 --> 00:46:24,628
You know what, Granville? You're nothing
but a big old dumb stupid fool.

476
00:46:24,843 --> 00:46:29,920
Makes more sense for me to be
busting their heads, than busting yours.

477
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:32,512
Oh, nigger, please. Shit.

478
00:46:34,019 --> 00:46:36,095
Where are they?

479
00:46:36,312 --> 00:46:39,563
They're not due for another
five minutes. What's the matter?

480
00:46:41,067 --> 00:46:42,775
We're in big trouble.

481
00:46:42,986 --> 00:46:46,569
I don't even know if these clowns
played high school football,

482
00:46:46,781 --> 00:46:48,857
and we're playing a semi-pro team.

483
00:46:49,075 --> 00:46:52,112
Plus, I haven't touched
a ball in seven years.

484
00:46:53,204 --> 00:46:56,122
Don't worry.
Once you've got it, you've got it.

485
00:46:56,332 --> 00:46:59,701
Throw one at that tyre over there.
It's just like making love.

486
00:46:59,919 --> 00:47:02,078
Once you've done it,
you never forget how.

487
00:47:10,346 --> 00:47:11,675
See?

488
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:16,635
All right, men. We're not going to have
time to run any complicated patterns.

489
00:47:17,228 --> 00:47:20,099
So we're going to concentrate
on the basic plays.

490
00:47:20,315 --> 00:47:26,685
But we might learn a few "specialty
plays", if you know what I mean.

491
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:37,571
Naturally, we're going to try to get
away with as much as possible.

492
00:47:37,791 --> 00:47:43,876
My executive assistant, Mr Nate
Scarboro, will be more than happy

493
00:47:44,672 --> 00:47:50,177
to show you just exactly how much
you can try to get away with.

494
00:47:54,057 --> 00:47:59,680
The one thing that you're going to have
to remember, the most important factor,

495
00:47:59,896 --> 00:48:02,980
is to protect your quarterback, me.

496
00:48:04,359 --> 00:48:07,728
Wait a minute. That's no bullshit.

497
00:48:07,946 --> 00:48:10,353
If anything happens to me,

498
00:48:10,573 --> 00:48:16,528
if I get hurt, we're going to have to live
with the fact that we had one chance,

499
00:48:16,746 --> 00:48:21,207
one chance in a million,
to humiliate those bastards,

500
00:48:21,418 --> 00:48:23,209
and we blew it.

501
00:48:25,463 --> 00:48:28,749
- Is that clear?
- Yeah!

502
00:48:28,967 --> 00:48:31,968
All right.
We're going to hurt them, right?

503
00:48:32,178 --> 00:48:33,756
Right!

504
00:48:33,972 --> 00:48:38,183
All right. We're going to kick
the shit out of them, right?

505
00:48:38,393 --> 00:48:40,682
- Right!
- What?

506
00:48:40,895 --> 00:48:42,271
Right!

507
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,520
Right, right, all right!

508
00:48:44,733 --> 00:48:48,481
Now, backs and ends come with me,
the rest stay here.

509
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:55,869
OK, linemen. Come on, linemen.
Come on out here.

510
00:48:57,370 --> 00:49:00,122
- What's the agility rating?
- Maximum is 10.

511
00:49:00,331 --> 00:49:05,077
All right, just hit the holes, I don't
want to hear you hit any rubber.

512
00:49:05,295 --> 00:49:07,252
Knees high!

513
00:49:07,464 --> 00:49:11,544
Come on, let's go, let's go...
That's a two.

514
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,429
Let's go! Very good! Knees high!

515
00:49:14,637 --> 00:49:19,015
Seven.
Let's go! Hubba, hubba! Knees high!

516
00:49:19,225 --> 00:49:22,345
OK, let's move over
to the blocking dummies.

517
00:49:22,562 --> 00:49:26,394
Come on, Sonny. Sonny, over here.

518
00:49:27,734 --> 00:49:29,228
All right, Granny.

519
00:49:34,491 --> 00:49:37,694
- What do I give Granny?
- Six.

520
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:43,869
Seven.

521
00:49:48,755 --> 00:49:53,713
- Would that be a ten?
- That's a ten.

522
00:49:53,927 --> 00:49:57,296
All right. I want
to see you really hit.

523
00:49:57,514 --> 00:50:00,384
On three. Hut one.

524
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,056
Hut two. Hut three!

525
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:15,105
All right.
Let's protect the passer this time.

526
00:50:18,535 --> 00:50:19,863
Good idea!

527
00:50:22,706 --> 00:50:24,532
Set!

528
00:50:24,749 --> 00:50:27,667
Hut one. Hut two. Hut three!

529
00:50:33,383 --> 00:50:37,546
- Sorry, man.
- Nice tackle.

530
00:50:39,848 --> 00:50:41,721
Hey, Coach.

531
00:50:41,933 --> 00:50:44,602
Where are all those
specialists you promised me?

532
00:50:47,814 --> 00:50:49,854
Jesus Christ!

533
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:53,224
There he is, Connie Shokner.

534
00:50:53,653 --> 00:50:55,942
The very baddest cat in the joint.

535
00:50:56,156 --> 00:50:58,444
Even the guards are terrified of him.

536
00:50:58,658 --> 00:51:03,901
He killed five people on the outside
and two in here, with his bare hands.

537
00:51:04,122 --> 00:51:05,700
That karate's bad.

538
00:51:05,915 --> 00:51:09,783
- That's before he learned karate.
- Oh.

539
00:51:16,885 --> 00:51:18,676
What's he doing now?

540
00:51:18,887 --> 00:51:21,460
Nobody's ever had the guts to ask him.

541
00:51:21,681 --> 00:51:24,433
Paul. Paul.

542
00:51:25,018 --> 00:51:28,802
- I smell a rat.
- Hello, Unger.

543
00:51:29,397 --> 00:51:30,975
Paul.

544
00:51:31,191 --> 00:51:33,349
I've got something
important to ask you.

545
00:51:34,194 --> 00:51:35,937
I want to be manager.

546
00:51:36,154 --> 00:51:40,863
- Caretaker's manager.
- I'm better than him. Let me prove it.

547
00:51:41,076 --> 00:51:44,326
- Beat it, Unger.
- Fuck off!

548
00:51:46,831 --> 00:51:50,035
Paul, why don't you like me?

549
00:51:50,251 --> 00:51:53,039
I'm crazy about you.
I think you're terrific.

550
00:51:54,381 --> 00:51:59,837
Friendship is something that
should never be taken lightly, Paul.

551
00:52:01,721 --> 00:52:06,798
I really want people to like me,
but they never do.

552
00:52:10,939 --> 00:52:16,313
I'd like very much
to be your friend, Paul.

553
00:52:19,614 --> 00:52:24,027
Well, it would be an honour
and a privilege, Unger.

554
00:52:24,244 --> 00:52:27,364
Now, if you'll just excuse me.

555
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:28,909
Paul.

556
00:52:30,542 --> 00:52:35,453
You sure about that?
I can't be manager?

557
00:52:35,672 --> 00:52:38,163
Caretaker's manager.

558
00:52:38,383 --> 00:52:42,630
If I'd have only found you sooner,
you know?

559
00:52:43,304 --> 00:52:47,682
Good thing he loves you. He burnt
to death five people he didn't like.

560
00:52:47,892 --> 00:52:49,684
Putty in my hands.

561
00:52:53,648 --> 00:52:56,104
Come out, boy. Come out.

562
00:53:07,954 --> 00:53:09,283
Hello, Mister Shokner.

563
00:53:14,169 --> 00:53:16,707
- Know how to play football?
- Yeah.

564
00:53:17,672 --> 00:53:21,884
Good. Would you like to play football
with us inmates?

565
00:53:22,594 --> 00:53:25,167
- No.
- Oh.

566
00:53:28,266 --> 00:53:30,009
We're playing the guards.

567
00:53:35,398 --> 00:53:37,225
Yeah. I want to play.

568
00:53:38,276 --> 00:53:40,150
He wants to play.

569
00:53:40,362 --> 00:53:42,484
Thank you, Mister Shokner.

570
00:53:43,323 --> 00:53:47,273
Now, remember,
nobody hits the quarterback.

571
00:53:47,494 --> 00:53:49,451
Blue 28!

572
00:53:51,206 --> 00:53:53,364
Set! Hut!

573
00:54:04,427 --> 00:54:07,214
He broke my fucking nose!

574
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,634
You bastard,
you broke my fucking nose!

575
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:12,510
Calm down. I'll fix it.

576
00:54:14,187 --> 00:54:16,559
I don't want to play this game.

577
00:54:16,773 --> 00:54:20,984
- He broke my nose.
- I'm going to fix it, OK? Here we go.

578
00:54:30,954 --> 00:54:35,034
- How does it look?
- It looks 100% better, doesn't it?

579
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:37,741
- 100%.
- It does?

580
00:54:37,961 --> 00:54:39,455
Yeah.

581
00:54:44,342 --> 00:54:47,011
- He did that on purpose.
- No, he didn't.

582
00:54:47,762 --> 00:54:51,345
- Yes, he did.
- Tell him you...

583
00:54:54,019 --> 00:54:56,058
Tell him you're sorry.

584
00:54:56,271 --> 00:54:57,599
Please.

585
00:55:00,066 --> 00:55:04,942
OK. I'm sorry.

586
00:55:05,155 --> 00:55:07,906
OK, everybody.
Huddle up, let's go.

587
00:55:09,492 --> 00:55:10,821
He said sorry.

588
00:55:11,036 --> 00:55:13,408
- Bullshit!
- He said he was sorry.

589
00:55:13,621 --> 00:55:15,080
You dumb pussy!

590
00:55:16,624 --> 00:55:22,579
- Try it again.
- Three, twenty-five, hut, hut!

591
00:55:29,179 --> 00:55:32,263
All right.
What about the rest of the team?

592
00:55:32,891 --> 00:55:36,307
Outside of Crewe, the only one
who looks like anything is Granville.

593
00:55:36,519 --> 00:55:39,935
- Granville could give you real trouble.
- All right, that's all.

594
00:55:57,707 --> 00:56:00,792
- Well?
- It's going to be a turkey shoot.

595
00:56:01,002 --> 00:56:03,540
He's right, sir.
We're going to destroy 'em.

596
00:56:03,755 --> 00:56:05,961
It's a cinch, boss. A cinch.

597
00:56:06,925 --> 00:56:08,253
Cinch.

598
00:56:08,468 --> 00:56:09,796
Destroy 'em.

599
00:56:11,763 --> 00:56:14,052
Too cute.

600
00:56:18,812 --> 00:56:22,512
That's what you said last year before
we lost to Endicott Steel, remember?

601
00:56:24,401 --> 00:56:29,027
There's no sense us taking any chances,
letting ourselves get hurt.

602
00:56:29,239 --> 00:56:33,023
- So see what we can do about Granville.
- Yes, sir.

603
00:56:33,576 --> 00:56:35,735
Granville, get your ass over here.

604
00:56:44,462 --> 00:56:46,087
Yes, sir, Lieutenant.

605
00:56:48,967 --> 00:56:51,505
What the hell
you think you're doing, boy?

606
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,546
You pick that up.

607
00:57:00,895 --> 00:57:02,555
Yes, sir.

608
00:57:02,772 --> 00:57:06,556
What is your problem, fat man?

609
00:57:06,776 --> 00:57:09,896
Know why you spades always
calling each other "brother"?

610
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:11,858
No, sir.

611
00:57:12,073 --> 00:57:16,320
'Cause half of you don't know who your
daddy is, so you might be brothers.

612
00:57:27,338 --> 00:57:28,749
Yes, sir, Lieutenant.

613
00:57:29,424 --> 00:57:32,294
- You think that's funny?
- Yes, sir.

614
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:34,302
You want to hit me, don't you?

615
00:57:35,096 --> 00:57:36,840
No, sir, Lieutenant.

616
00:57:37,057 --> 00:57:43,854
You're too ignorant to know when a man's
calling you a stupid, uneducated nigger.

617
00:57:49,652 --> 00:57:54,231
Yes, sir, Lieutenant.
May I go now, sir?

618
00:57:54,449 --> 00:57:57,320
Yeah, get out of my sight.

619
00:58:14,761 --> 00:58:17,133
Blue 48!

620
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:20,382
Blue 48!

621
00:58:22,435 --> 00:58:25,105
Set!
Hut one!

622
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:33,693
Shit.

623
00:58:37,659 --> 00:58:39,367
Hey, lightweight.

624
00:58:41,204 --> 00:58:42,746
What the hell is this?

625
00:58:42,956 --> 00:58:44,415
Here come the rain-clouds.

626
00:58:45,083 --> 00:58:46,791
What do they want?

627
00:58:48,253 --> 00:58:53,294
Granny tells us you need a little help.
Says you can guarantee no work detail.

628
00:58:57,137 --> 00:59:00,671
- Yeah.
- Guarantee special food like Granny gets?

629
00:59:01,057 --> 00:59:02,386
Yeah.

630
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:05,056
We get to hit those guards
like Granny said?

631
00:59:05,478 --> 00:59:08,930
You get to hit 'em.

632
00:59:12,193 --> 00:59:13,985
What else can we offer them?

633
00:59:14,195 --> 00:59:16,686
...having a Geneva conference
about playing with us.

634
00:59:17,615 --> 00:59:19,608
What is this bullshit?

635
00:59:21,578 --> 00:59:22,906
Well, Mister Crewe.

636
00:59:24,039 --> 00:59:25,581
We've come to terms.

637
00:59:26,249 --> 00:59:28,657
Compliments from
the Greater Chicago Youth Authority.

638
00:59:28,877 --> 00:59:30,668
There goes the neighbourhood.

639
00:59:53,818 --> 00:59:55,894
You wanted to see me?

640
00:59:56,112 --> 00:59:57,856
Yes, sir.

641
01:00:01,284 --> 01:00:03,953
...especially Unger.

642
01:00:04,162 --> 01:00:05,787
- Unger?
- Yes.

643
01:00:05,997 --> 01:00:10,244
Unger has a direct pipeline
to Captain Knauer.

644
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:14,505
It's impossible for me to have
a secret practice while Unger's around.

645
01:00:16,883 --> 01:00:20,252
I'm supposed
to reschedule the yard activities

646
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:24,337
for three uninterrupted hours
of secret practice?

647
01:00:24,557 --> 01:00:27,095
- That right?
- Yes, sir. Right.

648
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:29,433
And you will talk to Captain Knauer?

649
01:00:29,646 --> 01:00:34,059
- I'll speak to the captain on matters.
- Thank you, sir.

650
01:00:35,443 --> 01:00:36,985
Mister Crewe.

651
01:00:37,195 --> 01:00:40,030
Just what is it you
have up your sleeve?

652
01:00:40,573 --> 01:00:44,156
I'm just trying to give you
a football team, Warden.

653
01:00:44,369 --> 01:00:50,538
And along the way, maybe give the men
some pride and some dignity.

654
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:53,324
Of course, only for a little while.

655
01:00:55,797 --> 01:01:00,673
I know you've got something more
bouncing around inside that head of yours.

656
01:01:02,721 --> 01:01:05,128
You want a game, right?

657
01:01:06,516 --> 01:01:10,134
My men don't have a chance in hell
of winning that game.

658
01:01:10,353 --> 01:01:15,062
You know it, I know it,
I just don't want them to know it.

659
01:01:15,734 --> 01:01:17,276
OK?

660
01:01:23,366 --> 01:01:27,281
Man! I ain't had steak
like this in five years!

661
01:01:27,871 --> 01:01:29,662
I ain't eaten inside in six!

662
01:01:34,002 --> 01:01:36,707
What have you done for me lately?

663
01:01:36,921 --> 01:01:40,871
Today may be the high point
of a long and colourful career.

664
01:01:41,092 --> 01:01:44,461
Three, count 'em,
three gigantic rip-offs.

665
01:01:44,679 --> 01:01:48,843
First, I've got a box of brand new
equipment waiting to be stashed.

666
01:01:49,059 --> 01:01:51,680
- Compliments of Captain Knauer?
- No less.

667
01:01:51,895 --> 01:01:54,267
And the piece de resistance:

668
01:01:54,481 --> 01:01:59,606
How would you like actual game films
of the guardsmen in action?

669
01:01:59,819 --> 01:02:03,319
- Can you do that?
- Warden's own home movies.

670
01:02:03,531 --> 01:02:05,654
Caretaker, you never cease
to amaze me.

671
01:02:06,076 --> 01:02:09,658
Never. But you said
three gigantic rip-offs.

672
01:02:09,871 --> 01:02:11,449
That's only two.

673
01:02:11,664 --> 01:02:14,665
- You don't want to ruin the surprise.
- Surprise?

674
01:02:14,876 --> 01:02:16,619
- There's one thing.
- What?

675
01:02:17,712 --> 01:02:22,255
You're going to have to perform
a personal service.

676
01:02:27,305 --> 01:02:29,179
What kind of personal service?

677
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:42,350
The warden's expecting you.
Won't you come this way.

678
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:44,812
- Thank you, Captain.
- Thank you.

679
01:02:52,539 --> 01:02:57,580
I'm glad you're not in the swamp
anymore. That can ruin a man.

680
01:02:57,794 --> 01:02:59,336
Sure can.

681
01:02:59,546 --> 01:03:04,373
We don't have a great deal of time.
We have 15 minutes.

682
01:03:07,011 --> 01:03:10,380
- The game films.
- Thank you. That's terrific.

683
01:03:14,477 --> 01:03:18,226
Like I said, we only have 15 minutes.

684
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:42,161
Uh-uh. Won't go over the cuffs.

685
01:03:48,428 --> 01:03:51,180
You do this very often?

686
01:03:51,389 --> 01:03:54,260
I'm as far from Tallahassee
as you are, honey.

687
01:04:03,526 --> 01:04:04,855
Shokner.

688
01:04:06,988 --> 01:04:08,897
- Shokner.
- Yep.

689
01:04:10,158 --> 01:04:13,112
Hit him high like that,
he'll break your back.

690
01:04:13,995 --> 01:04:17,863
Breaks your back, he's going
to break the Superstar's back.

691
01:04:18,583 --> 01:04:23,459
Don't worry about him. I'll get
that son of a bitch with an empi.

692
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,291
Kiai!

693
01:04:25,507 --> 01:04:27,832
- Ready! Set!
- Kiai!

694
01:04:28,385 --> 01:04:30,840
- Ready! Set!
- Kiai!

695
01:04:31,429 --> 01:04:32,758
Take this bandage,

696
01:04:33,348 --> 01:04:35,471
dip it into the plaster of Paris,

697
01:04:35,684 --> 01:04:40,476
wrap it around the cast,
and in 15 minutes it's hard as rock.

698
01:04:40,689 --> 01:04:42,847
- Got it?
- Got it.

699
01:04:43,066 --> 01:04:47,277
- This is a picture of Walking Boss.
- Yeah!

700
01:04:47,487 --> 01:04:50,986
He once broke his right thigh-bone,
maybe you can clip it.

701
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:53,073
- We'll break it again!
- Got it?

702
01:04:53,284 --> 01:04:56,700
- Got it!
- All right. We can do it!

703
01:04:56,913 --> 01:04:59,618
Gentlemen, what we have here,
in common parlance,

704
01:04:59,833 --> 01:05:03,332
is known as a set of brass knuckles.

705
01:05:03,545 --> 01:05:06,000
...temporary disabilities.

706
01:05:06,214 --> 01:05:09,417
Balls. Gut. Ribs.

707
01:05:09,634 --> 01:05:11,543
- You got it?
- Got it!

708
01:05:11,761 --> 01:05:14,299
...the ball is snapped,
you go into your opponent,

709
01:05:14,514 --> 01:05:19,555
blocking him with your left arm
and bring this hand up into his chin,

710
01:05:19,769 --> 01:05:24,515
and I'll guarantee he'll be incapacitated
for the next several moments.

711
01:05:24,733 --> 01:05:27,140
- Got it?
- Got it!

712
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:30,397
All right. Here's the play
we're going to use.

713
01:05:30,613 --> 01:05:32,736
I don't think the guards
know this formation.

714
01:05:33,616 --> 01:05:37,400
It's called "Incidental punishment
after the ball is blown dead".

715
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:44,122
Any man you tackle gets an extra elbow,
knee, or kick in the mouth. Got it?

716
01:05:44,335 --> 01:05:45,664
Got it!

717
01:05:51,134 --> 01:05:54,420
I am, without a doubt,

718
01:05:54,637 --> 01:05:59,632
the finest maker of raisin jack
in the entire joint.

719
01:05:59,851 --> 01:06:04,228
I'm going to call this batch
"Old Caretaker".

720
01:06:04,439 --> 01:06:06,728
Do you always keep it in there?

721
01:06:06,941 --> 01:06:10,986
Well, it seems like a logical place.

722
01:06:15,075 --> 01:06:18,574
- Listen...
- It does get to you.

723
01:06:18,787 --> 01:06:22,072
...you and me are buddies, ain't we?
I got you laid.

724
01:06:22,749 --> 01:06:29,250
I got you the game film. I got you all
them monsters. I'm getting you drunk.

725
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:32,379
Yes, you are.

726
01:06:33,635 --> 01:06:36,968
- There's one thing still bothers me.
- What's that?

727
01:06:38,098 --> 01:06:39,675
Why'd you shave them points?

728
01:06:41,893 --> 01:06:45,309
I told you, for the money.

729
01:06:46,523 --> 01:06:50,734
No, no. Come on.
Give me the real reason.

730
01:06:52,195 --> 01:06:54,900
You really want to know, huh?

731
01:06:56,741 --> 01:06:59,113
I never gave a shit about football,

732
01:06:59,327 --> 01:07:02,079
or anything else.

733
01:07:02,288 --> 01:07:06,867
The only thing
I ever cared about's my old man.

734
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:13,046
My old man was blind,
never saw me play.

735
01:07:15,635 --> 01:07:20,131
Shit, I've been a professional
ever since I was 12 years old.

736
01:07:20,348 --> 01:07:23,219
Hustling nickels and
dimes playing pool.

737
01:07:24,477 --> 01:07:29,638
Didn't make enough money
to take care of him.

738
01:07:29,858 --> 01:07:35,978
And I figured when I got to pro ball,
I'd make one big killing.

739
01:07:37,323 --> 01:07:39,363
One big one.

740
01:07:39,951 --> 01:07:44,163
Make enough money to set him up,

741
01:07:45,707 --> 01:07:49,954
take care of him the rest of his life.

742
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:52,127
Then the son of a bitch died.

743
01:07:57,218 --> 01:07:59,756
Do you buy that?

744
01:08:02,182 --> 01:08:04,637
Well, that's good
because it's bullshit.

745
01:08:10,523 --> 01:08:13,939
Why do you think I shaved points?

746
01:08:15,111 --> 01:08:17,483
For the money.

747
01:08:21,409 --> 01:08:24,909
One minute to lock-up. One minute.

748
01:08:25,121 --> 01:08:26,913
Know what my problem's
always been?

749
01:08:27,123 --> 01:08:29,330
No, what?

750
01:08:29,542 --> 01:08:33,492
I've always had my shit together.
Always.

751
01:08:35,048 --> 01:08:39,425
My problem has been
that I couldn't lift it.

752
01:08:43,223 --> 01:08:46,342
I've got to go home.

753
01:08:46,559 --> 01:08:49,644
Oh, you're going to be a party pooper?

754
01:08:49,854 --> 01:08:54,066
It's OK. Some pro quarterbacks
drink all night long.

755
01:08:54,275 --> 01:08:56,897
I know.

756
01:08:57,112 --> 01:08:58,820
Goodnight.

757
01:08:59,030 --> 01:09:04,487
Goodnight, Paul. Here,
don't you want to take one with you?

758
01:09:05,453 --> 01:09:07,245
Lock it up!

759
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:11,287
- Lock it up!
- Lock it up now.

760
01:09:11,501 --> 01:09:14,253
Lock up. Turn off radios.

761
01:09:16,131 --> 01:09:20,674
- Turn off the radio.
- Lock it up!

762
01:09:26,182 --> 01:09:28,673
Come on, boy. Move.

763
01:09:28,893 --> 01:09:30,637
Want to be tucked in?

764
01:09:32,772 --> 01:09:36,640
There's nothing I can do for you,
Crewe got to the warden.

765
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:41,189
Captain, if you put me back in the general
population, one of those guys'll kill me.

766
01:09:41,406 --> 01:09:45,320
That's what happens to finks.
You've got Crewe to thank for that.

767
01:09:46,286 --> 01:09:47,863
He blew the whistle on you.

768
01:09:48,455 --> 01:09:50,328
On you specifically.

769
01:09:51,416 --> 01:09:54,085
- You got the problem.
- I can help you!

770
01:09:54,627 --> 01:09:59,539
Split right. Full back, dive right.
On one, ready?

771
01:09:59,758 --> 01:10:03,127
Go left! Go left! Go round!

772
01:10:05,013 --> 01:10:06,721
Twenty-eight.

773
01:10:08,641 --> 01:10:10,184
Hut!

774
01:10:11,978 --> 01:10:14,137
Way to go, way to go!

775
01:10:33,375 --> 01:10:34,750
- Let's go!
- Set!

776
01:10:35,377 --> 01:10:36,705
Hut!

777
01:10:39,547 --> 01:10:41,291
All right.

778
01:10:53,978 --> 01:10:55,852
General call for lock-up.

779
01:10:56,147 --> 01:11:02,316
- Let's do it! That's my team!
- All prisoners return to their cells.

780
01:11:02,529 --> 01:11:05,732
Shop period 5 will begin in 10 minutes.

781
01:11:05,949 --> 01:11:12,201
In ten minutes, we expect all men in
shop period 5 to meet outside cell block...

782
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:21,338
Cell block 3A
will take first call for dinner.

783
01:11:25,927 --> 01:11:29,877
Dinner rotation
will start with cell block 3A.

784
01:11:31,516 --> 01:11:33,473
We don't know enough
about these guys.

785
01:11:33,685 --> 01:11:36,769
Why don't we take another look
at the X-rays?

786
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:40,680
The medical files are on my bed,
get them, will you?

787
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:44,352
- Who do you see playing flanker?
- Miller.

788
01:12:13,516 --> 01:12:14,975
Get the goddamn key!

789
01:12:16,144 --> 01:12:17,686
Warden! Warden!

790
01:12:18,021 --> 01:12:19,645
Bring that key!

791
01:12:23,651 --> 01:12:25,644
Come on, get him out of there.

792
01:12:26,363 --> 01:12:27,691
Earth to earth,

793
01:12:27,906 --> 01:12:30,112
ashes to ashes,

794
01:12:30,325 --> 01:12:32,483
dust to dust,

795
01:12:32,702 --> 01:12:37,198
we commend the soul
of James "Caretaker" Farrell.

796
01:12:38,208 --> 01:12:42,834
And now, the peace of God
which passeth all understanding,

797
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:46,668
shall guard your hearts and souls.

798
01:12:47,175 --> 01:12:53,379
Unto our God and Father
be glory for ever and ever.

799
01:12:53,932 --> 01:12:55,924
Amen.

800
01:13:13,368 --> 01:13:16,238
Good afternoon, fellow inmates,
correctional officers,

801
01:13:16,454 --> 01:13:18,945
honoured guests,
ladies and gentlemen.

802
01:13:19,165 --> 01:13:23,459
This is Matt "Killer"Farrell broadcasting
on the Interstate Correctional Facility,

803
01:13:23,670 --> 01:13:27,917
the communication broadcasting
system of your state prison.

804
01:13:28,591 --> 01:13:33,134
This is part of Warden Rudolph Hazen's
progressive rehabilitation programme.

805
01:13:35,056 --> 01:13:38,223
This is indeed an historic occasion
as we sit here

806
01:13:38,435 --> 01:13:41,638
in this marvellous
Edward J. Hazen memorial stadium

807
01:13:42,355 --> 01:13:45,855
provided for us by our warden,
Rudolph Hazen.

808
01:13:47,652 --> 01:13:50,855
All right. Stand up for the warden.

809
01:14:02,459 --> 01:14:04,250
Just so you'll know,

810
01:14:04,461 --> 01:14:07,664
we've posted armed guards
all along the wall

811
01:14:07,881 --> 01:14:10,835
and at the public end of the field.

812
01:14:11,051 --> 01:14:16,092
So if any of you were thinking
of mingling with the civilians

813
01:14:16,306 --> 01:14:19,971
and wandering off with the crowd
at the end of the game,

814
01:14:23,688 --> 01:14:26,974
we will shoot you.

815
01:14:30,653 --> 01:14:32,064
Have a nice game, boys.

816
01:14:41,081 --> 01:14:43,998
See you on the field, Superstar.

817
01:15:11,111 --> 01:15:13,732
All right, now it's our turn.

818
01:15:14,531 --> 01:15:16,570
Here's a surprise from the Caretaker.

819
01:15:21,579 --> 01:15:23,287
Come on. Come on.

820
01:15:30,588 --> 01:15:33,506
Born free

821
01:15:33,717 --> 01:15:37,465
and life is worth living

822
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:40,929
but only worth living

823
01:15:41,141 --> 01:15:43,632
'cause you're

824
01:15:43,852 --> 01:15:47,434
born free

825
01:15:49,733 --> 01:15:53,481
Thanks to the men of cell block C,
affectionately known as

826
01:15:53,695 --> 01:15:56,696
the Citrus State Cheerios.

827
01:15:56,906 --> 01:15:58,899
The teams are coming onto the field.

828
01:15:59,117 --> 01:16:04,740
First, the Guards' defensive unit, led by
Captains Rassmeusen and Bogdanski.

829
01:16:08,293 --> 01:16:11,993
Leading out the offensive unit,
the Guards' coach and captain,

830
01:16:12,213 --> 01:16:14,918
Wilhelm Knauer.

831
01:16:15,216 --> 01:16:17,672
Let's hear it
for Warden Rudolph Hazen

832
01:16:17,886 --> 01:16:21,634
who has sponsored
today's progressive contest.

833
01:16:21,848 --> 01:16:23,722
Let's get the ball game going.

834
01:16:23,933 --> 01:16:28,180
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Mean Machine.

835
01:16:31,441 --> 01:16:33,849
They stole our new uniforms.

836
01:16:34,069 --> 01:16:36,642
They got our uniforms.

837
01:16:36,863 --> 01:16:38,856
That's right.

838
01:16:39,657 --> 01:16:44,118
...all time great,
quarterback for the Mean Machine,

839
01:16:44,329 --> 01:16:46,867
Paul "Wrecking" Crewe.

840
01:16:51,878 --> 01:16:56,836
The balance of the Mean Machine
with coach, Nate Scarboro.

841
01:16:57,675 --> 01:17:04,473
Please stand and join Mike Syke
in the singing of our national anthem.

842
01:17:19,698 --> 01:17:21,655
What are you dressed up for,
Hallowe'en?

843
01:17:21,866 --> 01:17:26,196
I figured if you get far enough ahead, you'd
let this middle-aged kid have some fun.

844
01:17:26,413 --> 01:17:28,868
Bullshit!

845
01:17:29,082 --> 01:17:30,541
- Call it.
- Heads.

846
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:34,166
It is a head.
You've won the toss and may elect to...

847
01:17:34,379 --> 01:17:36,336
How did you steal our uniforms?

848
01:17:37,048 --> 01:17:38,377
Cute, aren't they?

849
01:17:38,591 --> 01:17:40,418
Have a good clean game.

850
01:17:40,635 --> 01:17:42,260
So no matter what,

851
01:17:43,012 --> 01:17:45,420
just keep sticking it to them.

852
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:48,890
- Now, who are we?
- The Mean Machine.

853
01:17:49,102 --> 01:17:50,976
The Mean Machine.

854
01:17:51,187 --> 01:17:52,979
Mean Machine.

855
01:17:53,189 --> 01:17:54,732
Mean Machine.

856
01:17:54,941 --> 01:17:58,440
Mean Machine.

857
01:18:02,323 --> 01:18:04,067
Hit that dirt!

858
01:18:27,515 --> 01:18:29,093
One, two, one, two.

859
01:18:29,309 --> 01:18:33,770
- Ready, go!
- Hold them out and don't let 'em score

860
01:18:34,356 --> 01:18:37,771
Check them out
Hold them out and don't let 'em score

861
01:18:37,984 --> 01:18:39,562
Check them out
Hold them out

862
01:18:39,778 --> 01:18:42,399
and don't let 'em score

863
01:18:42,614 --> 01:18:44,441
Three. Twenty-five.

864
01:18:45,033 --> 01:18:46,657
Hut! Hut!

865
01:18:49,204 --> 01:18:52,323
Kick was blocked by Granville.

866
01:18:53,708 --> 01:18:59,332
The score now is Guardsmen 6,
Mean Machine 0.

867
01:19:00,173 --> 01:19:01,667
Guardsmen kick off.

868
01:19:01,883 --> 01:19:04,041
Good defence. Way to go.

869
01:19:06,388 --> 01:19:08,012
Here! Here!

870
01:19:08,223 --> 01:19:11,177
At the fourth down and a prize attack.

871
01:19:11,810 --> 01:19:14,217
Mean Machine serpentines
up to the line of scrimmage.

872
01:19:14,437 --> 01:19:16,893
Scrimmage is first and ten.

873
01:19:17,482 --> 01:19:19,439
Tighten the line. Move it.

874
01:19:20,735 --> 01:19:24,780
All right, here come the bad guys.
Pick 'em up.

875
01:19:25,407 --> 01:19:28,822
Set!
Hut!

876
01:19:31,204 --> 01:19:36,578
...in the end zone for two points
and a slashing tackle by number 61.

877
01:19:39,754 --> 01:19:41,083
- Bogdanski?
- Bogdanski.

878
01:19:41,297 --> 01:19:43,005
Who's supposed to stop him?

879
01:19:43,216 --> 01:19:45,292
- I am.
- Right.

880
01:19:45,510 --> 01:19:47,550
...goes out there in front of him.

881
01:19:47,762 --> 01:19:50,799
A free kick. Charlie Blue Eyes kicks.

882
01:19:51,015 --> 01:19:55,808
Taken at the Guards' 40.

883
01:19:56,021 --> 01:20:00,599
And he goes down
for an 18-yard drop back.

884
01:20:14,039 --> 01:20:18,167
He's dropped for a five-yard loss,
by number 66, Wilbur Gillan.

885
01:20:22,589 --> 01:20:24,380
...and he's fumbled.

886
01:20:26,926 --> 01:20:29,548
A Machine ball on their own 32.

887
01:20:29,763 --> 01:20:31,672
He's making the pass.

888
01:20:31,890 --> 01:20:35,093
He's hit by a vicious
diving tackle by Bogdanski.

889
01:20:40,190 --> 01:20:47,106
It's going to be a penalty for
Bogdanksi for hitting before the pass.

890
01:20:47,614 --> 01:20:52,904
So ladies and gentlemen, that
signals the end of the first quarter.

891
01:20:55,246 --> 01:20:58,746
...Mean Machine nothing.

892
01:21:01,252 --> 01:21:03,292
Ball goes back to Crewe,
he's waiting to pass...

893
01:21:13,848 --> 01:21:15,177
Scores!

894
01:21:16,184 --> 01:21:17,643
Damn!

895
01:21:29,030 --> 01:21:31,865
Settle down. Good hands. Here we go.

896
01:21:32,075 --> 01:21:36,322
Loose showboat on the centre snap.
We're going to fake it. Ready?

897
01:21:37,664 --> 01:21:42,907
And the Mean Machine will now line up
for the touchdown attempt.

898
01:21:52,846 --> 01:21:56,511
That makes the score eight to seven
in favour of the Guardsmen.

899
01:22:00,228 --> 01:22:03,063
Listen, guys. If they fake
the Walking Boss, cover me.

900
01:22:03,940 --> 01:22:07,309
- I gotta get that bastard.
- Bury that son of a bitch.

901
01:22:10,155 --> 01:22:12,824
First and ten on their own 31.

902
01:22:13,033 --> 01:22:18,074
Wilhelm Knauer. He's dropped
for a two-yard loss on the 29-yard line.

903
01:22:20,915 --> 01:22:23,288
Give me the brass knuckles.

904
01:22:34,888 --> 01:22:39,348
Take a good whiff.
Take a good whiff. How many fingers?

905
01:22:39,559 --> 01:22:41,682
- Three.
- Great.

906
01:22:43,355 --> 01:22:46,973
If that Levitt comes up the middle
again, I'm going to clothesline him.

907
01:22:47,192 --> 01:22:48,520
Now's the time.

908
01:22:48,735 --> 01:22:54,239
- Four three Mau Mau. Ready?
- Hey, hey, hey.

909
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:02,915
Receiver. Set! Hut!

910
01:23:03,124 --> 01:23:05,164
Ball goes to Knauer...

911
01:23:09,798 --> 01:23:12,289
Levitt was clotheslined,
and he is not moving.

912
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:16,629
I think I broke his fucking neck.

913
01:23:26,398 --> 01:23:28,058
I think he broke his fucking neck.

914
01:23:28,274 --> 01:23:30,944
I told you I broke his fucking neck.

915
01:23:33,655 --> 01:23:35,647
I think he broke his fucking neck.

916
01:23:35,865 --> 01:23:39,448
Sonny, if Knauer drops back
to punt, nail him.

917
01:23:40,161 --> 01:23:42,201
You bet your ass. I'll get him.

918
01:23:42,414 --> 01:23:44,038
We need the ball.

919
01:23:44,416 --> 01:23:50,039
A little bit of safety here.
A timid or chicken kind of football.

920
01:23:50,255 --> 01:23:54,833
Ball goes to Knauer
and he's smashed down.

921
01:23:59,889 --> 01:24:02,677
Give me a break, OK?

922
01:24:02,892 --> 01:24:07,638
Did you see that? Are you blind?
You're supposed to be impartial.

923
01:24:07,856 --> 01:24:11,640
Shit! Might as well be
a goddamn try-out for you.

924
01:24:15,864 --> 01:24:18,651
Third and long.
He likes to throw on the flat.

925
01:24:59,074 --> 01:25:04,613
And the half ends with the score:
Guardsmen 15, Mean Machine 13.

926
01:25:04,829 --> 01:25:07,285
We'll have the half-time statistics
for you in a few moments,

927
01:25:07,499 --> 01:25:12,789
but right now it's time
for our gala half-time activities.

928
01:25:13,797 --> 01:25:16,667
- Any suggestions, sir?
- Give your team a pep talk!

929
01:25:16,883 --> 01:25:19,125
Yes, sir.

930
01:25:19,344 --> 01:25:22,927
You've got to be a football hero

931
01:25:23,139 --> 01:25:26,473
To get along with a beautiful girl

932
01:25:26,685 --> 01:25:30,682
You gotta be a touchdown getter
you bet

933
01:25:30,897 --> 01:25:33,768
If you want to get a baby to pet

934
01:25:33,983 --> 01:25:38,776
Hey, Crewe!
What kind of football you call that?

935
01:25:38,988 --> 01:25:40,613
Same kind you're playing.

936
01:25:40,824 --> 01:25:44,691
We've let you mothers slide,
now we're going to hang you out to dry.

937
01:25:44,911 --> 01:25:47,117
Hey, Wilhelm. Hang loose.

938
01:25:52,669 --> 01:25:54,163
Those bastards were good.

939
01:25:54,379 --> 01:25:56,668
- Come on, damn it.
- Let's go.

940
01:26:04,472 --> 01:26:09,430
Call yourselves a football team?
Bunch of candy-asses.

941
01:26:09,644 --> 01:26:12,100
They're laughing at you next door.
Listen.

942
01:26:15,483 --> 01:26:18,983
What about Mawabe!
He's a bigshot, man...

943
01:26:33,543 --> 01:26:37,244
Just what the hell
do you think you're doing?

944
01:26:37,464 --> 01:26:39,836
You wanted a game, you got one.

945
01:26:40,050 --> 01:26:41,544
I never mentioned winning.

946
01:26:42,052 --> 01:26:44,128
You never said
anything about losing, either.

947
01:26:47,182 --> 01:26:48,676
I'll spell it out.

948
01:26:50,226 --> 01:26:51,804
We've got Unger in custody.

949
01:26:52,020 --> 01:26:55,471
- He's confessed to killing Caretaker.
- What?

950
01:26:55,690 --> 01:26:57,932
He said you knew all about it.

951
01:26:58,151 --> 01:27:00,393
But you didn't notify Captain Knauer.

952
01:27:00,612 --> 01:27:04,479
And that makes you an accessory.

953
01:27:05,909 --> 01:27:10,986
- You're full of crap.
- You sent Caretaker to that cell.

954
01:27:11,581 --> 01:27:14,037
You are an accessory to murder.

955
01:27:14,834 --> 01:27:18,666
You could be looking at twenty years,
and counting.

956
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:21,751
Bullshit! There's no way
that would stick in court.

957
01:27:21,966 --> 01:27:28,384
No? Mister Crewe, you could be in this
institution until you're old and grey,

958
01:27:28,598 --> 01:27:33,260
or until you're dead, whichever's
first, I can promise you that.

959
01:27:33,478 --> 01:27:39,647
You're going to lose the game.
And I want a 21-point spread.

960
01:27:42,153 --> 01:27:43,695
I can't do that.

961
01:27:46,366 --> 01:27:49,201
Of course you can.

962
01:27:49,911 --> 01:27:52,117
You've done it before.

963
01:27:56,292 --> 01:27:59,661
If I give you the 21 points,

964
01:28:00,630 --> 01:28:04,046
will you call off the dogs?

965
01:28:07,637 --> 01:28:10,128
The dogs?

966
01:28:10,348 --> 01:28:15,390
If you've got the game in the bag,
you tell your guys to coast.

967
01:28:17,188 --> 01:28:20,688
I don't want any of my men hurt.

968
01:28:25,405 --> 01:28:27,777
You have my word.

969
01:28:27,991 --> 01:28:30,482
Once we get the 21 points.

970
01:28:34,581 --> 01:28:37,701
You know, there's only one thing
I'm sorry about.

971
01:28:37,917 --> 01:28:39,246
What's that?

972
01:28:39,461 --> 01:28:41,952
That you're not playing,
knocking heads.

973
01:28:44,799 --> 01:28:47,884
I'm afraid I'm a little
too old for that.

974
01:28:48,094 --> 01:28:51,843
No. You never had the guts
to begin with.

975
01:28:59,606 --> 01:29:03,769
You're playing like a bunch of girls.
Every one of you. Candy-asses.

976
01:29:05,570 --> 01:29:07,978
You know who's beating you out there?

977
01:29:08,198 --> 01:29:10,985
Scum's beating you out there. Scum.

978
01:29:11,201 --> 01:29:13,905
And that's the lowest
part of the world.

979
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:17,157
Those are the criminals
and rapists. The murderers.

980
01:29:17,374 --> 01:29:19,117
You're supposed
to represent law and order.

981
01:29:20,126 --> 01:29:23,044
- You're supposed to...
- Listen to this shit.

982
01:29:23,254 --> 01:29:24,832
He thinks he's Rockne.

983
01:29:25,048 --> 01:29:26,756
You're letting the flag down.

984
01:29:26,966 --> 01:29:31,011
Go out there and do something about it.
Offence and defence play together.

985
01:29:31,221 --> 01:29:34,257
Let's go now. Come on!

986
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:55,199
- You're guaranteed a 21-point spread.
- What?

987
01:29:55,412 --> 01:29:58,496
Because of your performance,
I was forced to make a deal.

988
01:29:59,416 --> 01:30:01,539
In the second half we can beat them.

989
01:30:01,751 --> 01:30:05,535
I don't care what you think.
You'll do as I told you.

990
01:30:05,755 --> 01:30:07,547
Mister Crewe will do the same.

991
01:30:07,799 --> 01:30:09,127
Yes, sir.

992
01:30:11,553 --> 01:30:15,385
When you and your mental midgets
are 21 points ahead,

993
01:30:15,598 --> 01:30:20,095
I want you to inflict as much painful
damage on the prisoners as possible.

994
01:30:22,022 --> 01:30:25,355
So you understand,
before this game is over,

995
01:30:25,567 --> 01:30:31,320
I want every prisoner in this institution
to know what I mean by power,

996
01:30:31,531 --> 01:30:33,856
and who controls it.

997
01:30:35,493 --> 01:30:38,447
Do we understand each other?

998
01:30:38,663 --> 01:30:41,119
Yes, sir.

999
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:48,208
It's 15- 13

1000
01:30:48,423 --> 01:30:54,675
and the second half of a surprisingly
close ball game is about to begin.

1001
01:30:57,807 --> 01:31:01,093
...ball goes down
and is taken by number 36.

1002
01:31:09,235 --> 01:31:12,023
Set! Hut!

1003
01:31:12,238 --> 01:31:15,654
...goes straight back, he's getting good
protection and is looking for the receiver.

1004
01:31:15,867 --> 01:31:18,358
Throw the ball, man.
I'm open. Crewe!

1005
01:31:19,037 --> 01:31:20,365
Crewe!

1006
01:31:22,957 --> 01:31:24,582
Crewe!

1007
01:31:26,544 --> 01:31:28,620
Crewe! Oh, shit!

1008
01:31:31,299 --> 01:31:35,249
- I own that hamburger. Pass it.
- I was open. Can't you see?

1009
01:31:35,470 --> 01:31:36,964
Enough. I'm calling the plays.

1010
01:31:41,726 --> 01:31:43,304
Hut!

1011
01:31:58,827 --> 01:32:01,282
First and ten for the Guards
in opposition territory.

1012
01:32:01,496 --> 01:32:03,370
All right. No sweat.

1013
01:32:03,581 --> 01:32:05,823
Crewe has been poor
in this last series of plays.

1014
01:32:06,042 --> 01:32:08,118
Something seems
to have happened to him.

1015
01:32:08,336 --> 01:32:11,954
That last pass wasjust not
a Paul Crewe pass.

1016
01:32:12,716 --> 01:32:15,171
Come on, we'll get it back.

1017
01:32:22,892 --> 01:32:24,470
Touchdown!

1018
01:32:32,152 --> 01:32:34,025
Stick it to 'em. He's going to choke.

1019
01:32:38,408 --> 01:32:42,785
Paul Crewe looking to pass.
Gets a pass off and it's short.

1020
01:32:42,996 --> 01:32:45,368
It's short and it's picked off
by number 21.

1021
01:32:48,209 --> 01:32:50,001
We got it! We got it!

1022
01:32:50,503 --> 01:32:54,583
It's another touchdown for the Guards,
bringing their score to 28,

1023
01:32:54,799 --> 01:32:56,708
to thirteen for the Mean Machine.

1024
01:32:59,095 --> 01:33:01,004
- What's happening?
- I'm having a bad day.

1025
01:33:01,222 --> 01:33:04,722
- Bad day?
- Yes. Have you never had one?

1026
01:33:04,934 --> 01:33:07,342
Get off my back.

1027
01:33:11,191 --> 01:33:14,227
Set! Hut!

1028
01:33:15,612 --> 01:33:20,025
- Ball snaps back and there's a fumble...
- Fumble, fumble!

1029
01:33:20,241 --> 01:33:23,408
- What is that?
- You call yourself good!

1030
01:33:23,620 --> 01:33:27,203
Why did you change uniform?
Bullshit.

1031
01:33:31,127 --> 01:33:34,377
Paul Crewe
is taking himself out of the ball game.

1032
01:33:35,090 --> 01:33:38,957
Paul Crewe is limping badly.
He's limping off the field.

1033
01:33:39,177 --> 01:33:42,131
Pop Steadman's
bringing him to the bench.

1034
01:33:42,347 --> 01:33:45,632
We may have seen
the last of Paul Crewe for today.

1035
01:33:57,320 --> 01:34:01,567
Let's get this shoe off
and look at that ankle.

1036
01:34:01,783 --> 01:34:05,318
I could give him one of my empis.
I'd knock his head off.

1037
01:34:05,537 --> 01:34:07,328
I could be inside making wallets.

1038
01:34:07,539 --> 01:34:12,533
Doesn't feel broken. Somebody
step on it or did you twist it?

1039
01:34:12,752 --> 01:34:15,955
- Twisted it.
- Golden boy? Superstar?

1040
01:34:16,881 --> 01:34:20,333
To think we fought Granny for this crap.

1041
01:34:20,552 --> 01:34:22,959
Really sold us out, didn't you, Crewe?

1042
01:34:23,179 --> 01:34:26,050
Anybody can see
he's throwing the game.

1043
01:34:26,266 --> 01:34:28,508
Pull 'em down, go, let's go.

1044
01:34:29,853 --> 01:34:31,395
Let's go.

1045
01:34:31,604 --> 01:34:35,388
...at the line of scrimmage.
Less than an inch for a touchdown.

1046
01:34:35,608 --> 01:34:38,775
The ball is going back to Keller...

1047
01:34:39,696 --> 01:34:44,073
A touchdown for the Guards,
making the score 35 to 13.

1048
01:34:45,577 --> 01:34:50,654
With 5 minutes 58 left in the third
quarter, which has been all Guardsmen,

1049
01:34:51,458 --> 01:34:58,623
the score is 35 for the Guardsmen
and 13 for the Mean Machine.

1050
01:34:59,924 --> 01:35:01,253
No point.

1051
01:35:01,718 --> 01:35:03,924
With 5.58 left in the third period,

1052
01:35:04,137 --> 01:35:08,929
the score remains 35 for the Guardsmen
and 13 for the Mean Machine.

1053
01:35:10,769 --> 01:35:15,644
Kill that Indian mother! Get that
Indian by the boots! Get him over!

1054
01:35:17,776 --> 01:35:22,936
Good blocking.
Keep it up. Keep it up.

1055
01:35:23,156 --> 01:35:24,484
Come on now.

1056
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:30,077
Guards'ball, third and two
on their own 37-yard line.

1057
01:35:31,915 --> 01:35:34,916
Knauer takes the pass
and throws it to Levitt...

1058
01:35:35,126 --> 01:35:40,417
...Levitt takes the ball and he's going
to the Mean Machine 30-yard line...

1059
01:35:41,758 --> 01:35:45,091
...on me.
Jesus Christ! Another injury.

1060
01:35:45,303 --> 01:35:47,675
Come on.

1061
01:35:47,889 --> 01:35:53,310
...number 74, Shop Steward, is badly
hurt, bleeding badly from the mouth.

1062
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:57,220
...ball goes back to Knauer, who
hands off 11 for another long gain.

1063
01:35:58,191 --> 01:35:59,934
...another injury...

1064
01:36:00,652 --> 01:36:06,856
...and it's Sonny Tannen.
He seems to be badly shaken up.

1065
01:36:11,830 --> 01:36:14,071
Crybaby son of a bitch!

1066
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:19,369
Time! Another man down.

1067
01:36:25,719 --> 01:36:31,923
Superstar, what kind of deal did you
make this time? What did Hazen promise?

1068
01:36:32,767 --> 01:36:37,928
They're killing those guys out there
and you don't even care.

1069
01:36:44,654 --> 01:36:48,901
He's right, Crewe.
You fooled the hell out of me.

1070
01:36:49,117 --> 01:36:51,323
I trusted you
and you let me down.

1071
01:36:52,704 --> 01:36:57,745
I know you don't give a shit about nothing,
but I didn't think you'd sell us out.

1072
01:36:58,460 --> 01:37:02,956
Granny,
better get back in there.

1073
01:37:08,011 --> 01:37:11,047
Four three inside flank.
Ready? Break.

1074
01:37:14,267 --> 01:37:16,425
Ball's on the Mean Machine
48-yard line.

1075
01:37:16,644 --> 01:37:20,060
...ball's gone to Knauer,
he hands off 44...

1076
01:37:21,566 --> 01:37:23,025
...he's picking one up...

1077
01:37:34,371 --> 01:37:36,328
- What is it?
- Broken collarbone.

1078
01:37:36,539 --> 01:37:38,579
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

1079
01:37:38,792 --> 01:37:43,999
Officials are trying to break up that
fight, getting pretty rough in there.

1080
01:37:47,801 --> 01:37:52,961
Granny Granville is hurt. He's holding
his shoulder and appears to be badly hurt.

1081
01:37:53,181 --> 01:37:57,095
Probably a broken bone,
but he is on his feet.

1082
01:37:59,396 --> 01:38:01,435
Satisfied now?

1083
01:38:05,735 --> 01:38:07,064
Jesus, Sonny!

1084
01:38:07,278 --> 01:38:12,320
The officials will assess the penalty.
15 yards for unsporting conduct.

1085
01:38:17,288 --> 01:38:19,162
- Hey, Pop.
- Yeah?

1086
01:38:20,375 --> 01:38:24,075
That time you hit Hazen in the mouth,
was it worth it?

1087
01:38:25,046 --> 01:38:28,961
Was it worth 30 years?

1088
01:38:29,175 --> 01:38:31,382
Yeah. For me it was.

1089
01:38:34,681 --> 01:38:37,386
Well, give me my goddamn shoe.

1090
01:38:43,982 --> 01:38:45,310
Wait a minute.

1091
01:38:45,525 --> 01:38:51,610
Paul Crewe, number 22, is going back
into the game for the Mean Machine.

1092
01:38:51,823 --> 01:38:57,861
All right. New quarterback. Shok, you're
on the bench. Move over. Here we go.

1093
01:38:58,747 --> 01:39:02,447
- Makes no difference where you go.
- Fuck you.

1094
01:39:02,667 --> 01:39:04,992
Look who's back.
It's the baby boy.

1095
01:39:08,673 --> 01:39:13,086
- Set!
- Set, my ass.

1096
01:39:15,013 --> 01:39:16,637
What is he trying to pull?

1097
01:39:17,182 --> 01:39:19,803
- Hut!
- Uh-uh.

1098
01:39:20,018 --> 01:39:23,387
Get that Superstar.

1099
01:39:23,605 --> 01:39:25,977
Behind the line of scrimmage
for a six-yard goal.

1100
01:39:29,361 --> 01:39:34,521
Show 'em who's boss.
Get them. They ain't shit.

1101
01:39:37,827 --> 01:39:39,487
That's how it is?

1102
01:39:39,704 --> 01:39:43,784
They're in a huddle now. There's
the gun ending the third quarter.

1103
01:39:44,918 --> 01:39:48,038
That's the quarter.
Let's change ends.

1104
01:39:52,050 --> 01:39:55,335
Ball goes to Crewe. He's going to
pass on fourth and long-yard it.

1105
01:39:55,553 --> 01:39:57,427
...holds the ball
and goes up the middle.

1106
01:39:57,639 --> 01:39:58,967
Crewe goes up the middle...

1107
01:40:04,646 --> 01:40:06,473
That's it, Paul.

1108
01:40:10,151 --> 01:40:12,725
- The line is set...
- Hut!

1109
01:40:12,946 --> 01:40:18,106
...he's going up the centre.

1110
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:23,871
Shotgun left. Shotgun.

1111
01:40:26,876 --> 01:40:28,999
Hut! Hut!

1112
01:40:29,879 --> 01:40:33,711
Crewe's looking for a receiver.

1113
01:40:41,641 --> 01:40:42,970
Where's he going?

1114
01:40:43,476 --> 01:40:46,845
There's a figure that graced
the Polo Grounds for years.

1115
01:40:48,815 --> 01:40:51,520
What are you guys so surprised about?

1116
01:40:51,735 --> 01:40:54,273
I'm not letting you have all the fun.

1117
01:40:55,113 --> 01:40:58,067
Bootleg on one.
Ready? Break.

1118
01:40:58,908 --> 01:41:02,953
OK. Come on.
Looks good. Keep it alive.

1119
01:41:05,248 --> 01:41:06,790
Set!

1120
01:41:09,210 --> 01:41:11,002
Hut!

1121
01:41:18,428 --> 01:41:21,049
There's a first down
on the 20-yard line.

1122
01:41:24,434 --> 01:41:25,762
Your confidence back?

1123
01:41:26,728 --> 01:41:29,480
- Get Scarboro.
- Son of a bitch.

1124
01:41:32,734 --> 01:41:37,195
Ball goes back to Crewe,
he's waiting to pass...

1125
01:41:50,001 --> 01:41:54,378
...by Bogdanski. Bogdanski hit
Nate Scarboro a cheap shot.

1126
01:41:54,589 --> 01:41:56,629
A reprehensible action.

1127
01:41:57,258 --> 01:41:59,085
Cheap shot!

1128
01:42:01,679 --> 01:42:03,637
Let me at the son of a bitch.

1129
01:42:06,184 --> 01:42:09,635
Old Double O
is down and seems badly hurt.

1130
01:42:10,689 --> 01:42:12,646
How is it, Nate?

1131
01:42:12,857 --> 01:42:17,769
I love it. After all these years,
my first touchdown.

1132
01:42:18,613 --> 01:42:21,365
It's got to be his knee.
I heard it pop.

1133
01:42:22,450 --> 01:42:25,285
- Get him up.
- You'll be OK. Hang in there.

1134
01:42:33,002 --> 01:42:35,375
Hey, Paul. You've got to do it.

1135
01:42:37,841 --> 01:42:40,925
- Screw Hazen!
- Don't worry. He'll get his.

1136
01:42:43,221 --> 01:42:45,012
Good old Nate Scarboro.

1137
01:42:45,223 --> 01:42:48,224
One of the most beloved men
this institution has had.

1138
01:43:00,405 --> 01:43:03,608
The extra point kick is good.

1139
01:43:03,825 --> 01:43:06,826
Tightening that score now
to 35 to 20.

1140
01:43:08,329 --> 01:43:12,707
Blue Eyes can kick the ball ten yards,
can someone fall on it?

1141
01:43:12,917 --> 01:43:15,954
- Right on.
- Then let's go!

1142
01:43:21,885 --> 01:43:25,004
Charlie Blue Eyes approaches the ball
and kicks...

1143
01:43:25,221 --> 01:43:27,510
It's an on-side kick...

1144
01:43:33,730 --> 01:43:36,766
And it's recovered
for the Mean Machine.

1145
01:43:39,861 --> 01:43:42,613
Shut up. Shut up!

1146
01:43:42,822 --> 01:43:44,732
You're stinking the place up.

1147
01:43:45,367 --> 01:43:48,533
- Can we take 'em?
- Yeah!

1148
01:43:53,249 --> 01:43:56,369
Split right. On two. Ready?

1149
01:44:05,136 --> 01:44:06,714
Set!

1150
01:44:08,139 --> 01:44:09,764
Hut!

1151
01:44:09,974 --> 01:44:13,723
Ball goes back to Crewe.
Crewe hands off to number 30...

1152
01:44:21,569 --> 01:44:24,440
...23 yards.
Crewe's down on the ten-yard line.

1153
01:44:24,656 --> 01:44:26,399
A beautiful piece of razzle-dazzle.

1154
01:44:27,158 --> 01:44:32,698
Paul Crewe reached into
his bag of tricks that time, folks.

1155
01:44:46,636 --> 01:44:51,179
Charlie Blue Eyes splits the uprights
and that makes it 35 to 27.

1156
01:44:51,391 --> 01:44:54,226
- How we doing?
- Fine.

1157
01:44:54,436 --> 01:44:56,891
There you go, Nate.

1158
01:44:57,105 --> 01:45:00,723
I heard you were on your way in.

1159
01:45:03,737 --> 01:45:06,856
Hey, did they tell you
about my touchdown?

1160
01:45:07,073 --> 01:45:11,652
We repeat, with five minutes and
four seconds left in the fourth quarter,

1161
01:45:11,870 --> 01:45:14,408
there is now only
an eight-point difference.

1162
01:45:19,252 --> 01:45:22,502
- Here we go.
- Can you drop-kick from here?

1163
01:45:22,714 --> 01:45:24,872
- I could try.
- Drop-kick?

1164
01:45:25,842 --> 01:45:28,000
It's fourth and four
and we're going to drop-kick.

1165
01:45:28,219 --> 01:45:32,087
Shotgun.
Drop-kick, on one. Ready?

1166
01:45:37,354 --> 01:45:39,809
...he's got to come up
with something different.

1167
01:45:41,858 --> 01:45:44,183
Ball goes back to
Charlie Blue Eyes...

1168
01:45:49,532 --> 01:45:51,442
I haven't seen one
of those in years.

1169
01:45:52,369 --> 01:45:55,073
- What was that?
- A drop-kick.

1170
01:45:55,288 --> 01:45:58,657
- How much does that count?
- Three points.

1171
01:45:59,084 --> 01:46:02,250
For that? Bullshit!

1172
01:46:04,130 --> 01:46:07,333
The score stands Guards 35,
Mean Machine 30.

1173
01:46:07,550 --> 01:46:10,966
Fourth and 21
for the Mean Machine on their own 39.

1174
01:46:11,179 --> 01:46:13,800
Crewe is feigning...

1175
01:46:14,015 --> 01:46:16,589
...and he dumps off another pass.

1176
01:46:26,152 --> 01:46:28,643
...Bogdanski saves a touchdown.

1177
01:46:28,863 --> 01:46:32,528
Bogdanski is really wreaking havoc
on that Mean Machine team.

1178
01:46:35,662 --> 01:46:38,200
Quiet down.
Now, listen to me.

1179
01:46:38,915 --> 01:46:42,747
We're going to let Bogdanski come right
through. Nobody touch him. Got it?

1180
01:46:42,961 --> 01:46:47,836
I want to try something.
If it works, everybody hit him. Right?

1181
01:46:48,049 --> 01:46:53,256
- Right.
- Split right. All curl, on one. Ready?

1182
01:46:54,055 --> 01:46:55,384
Red left!

1183
01:46:55,890 --> 01:46:58,642
Blue 69!

1184
01:46:59,102 --> 01:47:01,308
Blue 69!

1185
01:47:02,981 --> 01:47:04,641
Set!

1186
01:47:08,903 --> 01:47:12,272
...throws the ball
directly at Bogdanski's groin.

1187
01:47:16,411 --> 01:47:18,783
- Get off him.
- That's bullshit!

1188
01:47:21,124 --> 01:47:23,745
They're unravelling the tangle now,

1189
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:27,459
and there's a penalty against
the Mean Machine for roughness,

1190
01:47:27,672 --> 01:47:33,129
and that pass sure didn't look like
it was an accident.

1191
01:47:33,636 --> 01:47:38,097
Bogdanski is staggering,
but he is up and on his feet.

1192
01:47:38,308 --> 01:47:44,013
OK. We've got fifteenth.
Let's huddle up on the ball. Huddle up.

1193
01:47:50,987 --> 01:47:52,316
Unbelievable.

1194
01:48:01,373 --> 01:48:03,282
Hey, Bog.
Get out of here.

1195
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:05,788
- Come on.
- I know what I'm doing.

1196
01:48:06,002 --> 01:48:10,000
- Worked once, got to work again. Right?
- Right.

1197
01:48:10,215 --> 01:48:14,675
All right.
One more time, on two. Ready?

1198
01:48:14,886 --> 01:48:19,014
It's third and 32
for the Mean Machine.

1199
01:48:25,230 --> 01:48:27,721
Set!
Hut!

1200
01:48:27,941 --> 01:48:30,266
Ball goes back to Crewe...

1201
01:48:31,861 --> 01:48:34,566
Crewe hits Bogdanski with the ball
right in the...

1202
01:48:34,781 --> 01:48:37,272
...in the nether regions.

1203
01:48:37,492 --> 01:48:41,276
Once again, Bogdanski is down,
the Mean Machine is dirty.

1204
01:48:56,928 --> 01:49:00,012
- He's not breathing.
- Do something. Try mouth-to-mouth.

1205
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:04,554
- You want to?
- No way.

1206
01:49:05,145 --> 01:49:06,520
Ambulance. Help!

1207
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:14,026
They are taking Bogdanski
off the field in an ambulance.

1208
01:49:38,845 --> 01:49:41,134
He pushed him!

1209
01:49:45,810 --> 01:49:49,226
You can't see,
you blind son of a bitch.

1210
01:49:49,439 --> 01:49:53,900
Hey, Walking Boss,
here's your crying towel.

1211
01:49:54,110 --> 01:49:57,111
You big fat-assed son of a bitch.

1212
01:49:57,322 --> 01:50:00,857
Go get off and stay off.

1213
01:50:01,076 --> 01:50:02,570
First down.

1214
01:50:03,453 --> 01:50:04,781
Time out.

1215
01:50:04,996 --> 01:50:06,656
Jesus!

1216
01:50:09,125 --> 01:50:12,210
- Scooter, you want to hit somebody?
- Yeah.

1217
01:50:12,420 --> 01:50:15,457
All right. Tackle eligible.

1218
01:50:15,673 --> 01:50:17,583
Mawabe, talk to me.

1219
01:50:17,801 --> 01:50:20,374
- What are you doing?
- One step off the line.

1220
01:50:20,595 --> 01:50:22,920
- I'll step on the line.
- Right. On one. Ready?

1221
01:50:23,139 --> 01:50:28,382
Machine's ball, first and ten
on the Guards' 31-yard line.

1222
01:50:28,603 --> 01:50:30,097
Blue 28!

1223
01:50:30,313 --> 01:50:33,350
...less than one minute
57 seconds left.

1224
01:50:34,150 --> 01:50:35,775
Hut!

1225
01:50:43,284 --> 01:50:45,076
Protest that play!

1226
01:50:55,839 --> 01:50:57,333
Crewe, call time.

1227
01:50:58,007 --> 01:51:01,423
Time. Time.
Time, ref. Time.

1228
01:51:01,636 --> 01:51:04,554
First and goal on the one-yard line,

1229
01:51:04,764 --> 01:51:06,804
as Crewe calls time out, with...

1230
01:51:07,017 --> 01:51:10,053
...40 seconds left on the clock.

1231
01:51:10,270 --> 01:51:12,843
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

1232
01:51:13,064 --> 01:51:16,599
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

1233
01:51:16,818 --> 01:51:18,609
Mean Machine!

1234
01:51:21,156 --> 01:51:23,694
Quiet down. Split right...
Joe Jack!

1235
01:51:23,908 --> 01:51:26,862
Split right, sweep left.
On one. Ready?

1236
01:51:28,872 --> 01:51:32,205
Blue 28! Blue 28!

1237
01:51:32,417 --> 01:51:34,244
Set! Hut!

1238
01:51:41,634 --> 01:51:44,339
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is really a ball game.

1239
01:51:44,554 --> 01:51:46,677
This is a great ball team.

1240
01:51:46,890 --> 01:51:51,018
They're giving these Guardsmen
the fight of their lives.

1241
01:51:54,522 --> 01:51:58,022
Split right, roll out right,
option pass. Be waiting, Mace.

1242
01:51:58,234 --> 01:52:00,357
On two, on two. Ready?

1243
01:52:00,570 --> 01:52:03,654
- Second and goal.
- Blue 20.

1244
01:52:04,866 --> 01:52:08,733
Blue 20. Set! Hut!

1245
01:52:10,288 --> 01:52:11,830
Crewe feigns the pass...

1246
01:52:12,540 --> 01:52:15,660
...and he throws...

1247
01:52:15,877 --> 01:52:19,661
...stopping the clock again
with 16 seconds left.

1248
01:52:22,717 --> 01:52:25,208
Flip right, dive left, Indian.

1249
01:52:25,428 --> 01:52:28,098
Now, if we don't make it,
everybody yell time.

1250
01:52:28,306 --> 01:52:30,215
Everybody yell time.
On one. Ready?

1251
01:52:36,189 --> 01:52:40,317
Blue 29! Blue 29!
Set!

1252
01:52:41,361 --> 01:52:43,899
Ball goes back to Crewe...

1253
01:52:46,908 --> 01:52:50,407
Time! Time!

1254
01:52:50,787 --> 01:52:53,622
Crewe calls for his third
and last time out

1255
01:52:53,832 --> 01:52:56,204
with seven seconds left on the clock.

1256
01:52:56,876 --> 01:52:59,035
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

1257
01:53:01,131 --> 01:53:02,957
Where the hell's he going?

1258
01:53:04,217 --> 01:53:05,592
Let's find out.

1259
01:53:06,511 --> 01:53:11,054
Crewe has taken his last time out
and he's heading toward the bench.

1260
01:53:11,266 --> 01:53:16,391
He's heading toward the bench
followed by his entire offensive unit.

1261
01:53:17,564 --> 01:53:18,939
Most unusual...

1262
01:53:20,025 --> 01:53:23,524
I don't know what they're doing,
it's silent as a church.

1263
01:53:24,487 --> 01:53:28,355
It looks more like a prayer meeting
than a huddle.

1264
01:53:28,575 --> 01:53:30,900
Whatever happens,
regardless of the outcome,

1265
01:53:31,119 --> 01:53:34,286
this has been one fantastic showing.

1266
01:53:34,497 --> 01:53:37,332
We've come too far together
to stop now.

1267
01:53:37,542 --> 01:53:40,876
For Granny, for Nate,

1268
01:53:43,715 --> 01:53:47,629
for Caretaker, let's do it.

1269
01:53:55,769 --> 01:53:58,176
Mean Machine!

1270
01:54:01,149 --> 01:54:02,809
Mean Machine!

1271
01:54:05,779 --> 01:54:08,733
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

1272
01:54:21,169 --> 01:54:24,170
- Hold it down!
- Cool it!

1273
01:54:25,548 --> 01:54:28,170
Set!

1274
01:54:29,594 --> 01:54:31,587
Hut!

1275
01:56:02,020 --> 01:56:06,598
Thirty-six, thirty-five,
in favour of the Mean Machine.

1276
01:56:15,200 --> 01:56:16,528
Ladies and gentlemen,

1277
01:56:16,743 --> 01:56:18,901
like the fabled phoenix of old...

1278
01:56:30,882 --> 01:56:33,373
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

1279
01:56:33,593 --> 01:56:37,128
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

1280
01:56:37,347 --> 01:56:41,012
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

1281
01:56:41,226 --> 01:56:43,302
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

1282
01:57:07,460 --> 01:57:13,830
- You know, you guys ain't half bad.
- You're right.

1283
01:57:15,552 --> 01:57:17,046
Fuck you, boy.

1284
01:57:17,637 --> 01:57:20,175
Not today, boss.

1285
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:31,227
History.

1286
01:57:31,443 --> 01:57:35,690
We stopped 'em. We are number one!

1287
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:48,325
Where's your goddamn
power theory now?

1288
01:57:48,543 --> 01:57:50,536
He's trying to escape.

1289
01:57:50,754 --> 01:57:53,505
- Oh, shit!
- Officer!

1290
01:57:53,715 --> 01:57:55,707
- Crewe!
- I'm talking to you!

1291
01:57:58,428 --> 01:57:59,756
Crewe!

1292
01:57:59,971 --> 01:58:02,379
He's trying to escape. Shoot him!

1293
01:58:03,016 --> 01:58:06,100
- Crewe!
- You going to let him escape? Shoot.

1294
01:58:06,311 --> 01:58:09,098
- Shoot him, you... Shoot him!
- Crewe!

1295
01:58:10,523 --> 01:58:14,770
- Crewe!
- Kill him! Kill that son of a bitch!

1296
01:58:14,986 --> 01:58:16,646
Shoot him!

1297
01:58:36,841 --> 01:58:39,167
Game ball.

1298
01:58:54,109 --> 01:58:56,481
Stick this in your trophy case.

1299
01:59:02,951 --> 01:59:05,572
I knew you could do it!

1300
01:59:06,615 --> 01:59:17,042
