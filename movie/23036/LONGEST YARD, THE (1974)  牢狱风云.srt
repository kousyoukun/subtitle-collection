哈里森正要冲刺深入敌方
And he had some room to run

而来自佛罗里达杰克逊维尔市的

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,610
可能获得第一次达阵
as he plows close to the 20-yard line.

28
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,690

克鲁先生 你怎么看半职业球队
Mr. Crewe,what do you think of semi-pro ball?

157
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,180
半职业就是个笑话
Semi-pro's a joke.

158
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,610
也许我们可以听听专业人员的指点

159
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,290

没人让你打球 克鲁先生

我只想坐完牢

你向我保证过要拿冠军

193
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,640
每年 你都失败而归
And for each of those years, you've come up short.

You and all that overpriced beef you call a team!

For all I've given you, we should be in the goddamn Super Bowl!

208
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,970
我没耐心了 该死的
I've lost patience,God damn it!

209

00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:15,460
好吧 我们走
All right,let's move it.

225

这里我说了算
I run this prison!

226
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,050
我让你别想踢球
I tell you to forget football,

227
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,200
你就别再想

228
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:25,870
你这么生气干嘛
What the hell are you so mad about?

229

你最好认真点

大明星 睡得好吗

238
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,170
就是从哪铲的泥 再铲回去
That's where you shovel it in, and you shovel it back out again.

267
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,900
流星

268
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,570
往前走
Move the line.

你们这里的人真友好啊

270
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,800
-可能是你自己的错  -真的吗
-Might be your own fault. -Really?

271
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,940
这里大部分人一无所有
Most of these ol' boys don't have nothin'.

272
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,820
没有任何希望
Never had nothin' to start with.

273
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:11,970
但你 无所不有
But you,you had it all.

274
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,160
但却让你的队友失望了
Then you let your teammates down,

275
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:16,780
被抓进了监狱
got yourself caught with your hand in the cookie jar.

276
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,920
是这样吗
I did,did I?

277
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,950
不说你有没有让人失望
I ain't sayin' you did or you didn't.

278
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,610
我说的是
All I'm sayin' is,

279
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,820
你可以抢银行 卖毒品
you could've robbed banks,sold dope,

280
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,120
或偷你外婆的养老金
or stole your grandmother's pension checks 

281
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,250
我们都不在乎
and none of us would've minded.

282
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,000
但给球队丢分
But shavin' points off of a football game,

283
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,720
天 这可真是不美国人
man,that's un-American.

284
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,890
你很重视这里的球赛 是吧
You take your football down here real serious,don't you?

285
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:40,550
-介意我问个问题吗  -没事
-You mind if I ask you one question? -Yeah,I do.

286
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,320
-为什么故意输掉比赛  -说来话长
-Why'd you do it? -It's a long story.

287
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,380
没事 我有八年时间
Well,I got eight years.

288
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,180
天呐 这是什么
Oh,my God! What the hell is that?

289
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,320
这是监狱长球队的一个成员
That's a member of the Warden's football team.

290
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,260
告诉你 有些看守
I'm telling you,some of these guards

291
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,090
不只是每天普通的看守
are not just the everyday run-of-the-mill guards.

292
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,500
克鲁
Crewe!

293
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,320
格兰维尔 出列
Granville! Front and center!

294
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,050
这是干嘛
What now?

295
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,050
这表示我们没法吃完这顿美味午餐了
That means we don't get to finish this delicious lunch.

296
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,590
他看什么
What's he lookin' for?

297
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,140
蛇
Snakes.

298
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,830
-蛇  -对
-Snakes? -Yeah.

299
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,050
休息五分钟
Take five!

300
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:03,520
-完了吗 工头  -今天还没有 
-Rollin' one,boss? -Not today,boy.

301
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,280
好极了
Terrific.

302
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,540
橄榄球笨蛋
Football faggot!

303
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,330
-这里需要盐药丸 工头  -去拿吧
-Salt pill up here,boss? -Go get it,boy.

304
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,800
你在这个收容所多久了 波普
How long you been in this asylum,Pop?

305
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,710
34年
Thirty-four years.

306
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,150
"34年"
"Thirty-four years"?

307
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,680
对 六年半之前来到这片沼泽地
Yep. Last six and a half right here in the swamp.

308
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,510
老得干不动活
Too old for reclamation,

309
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,960
所以他们让我当营房主管
so they made me barracks chief.

310
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:52,780
你应该很快就被假释了吧
You ought to be comin' up for parole soon,shouldn't you?

311
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,550
30年前 我不小心
Well,30 years ago I made

312
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,230
揍了一个混蛋
the mistake of sluggin' a fish bull.

313
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,190
哈森
Hazen.

314
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,330
真不走运 他当了监狱长
Just my luck,he made warden.

315
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,410
我64岁快死了 他把我弄到了这里
Sent me out here when I was 64 to die.

316
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,500
但我一直撑着
But I've been hangin' on.

317
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,240
我想 从现在开始
Way I figure,we'll all be in

318
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,290
我们都会永远待在这里了
the same place 1,000 years from now,

319
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:16,880
-所以管他呢  -是啊 管他呢
-so what the hell? -Yeah,what the hell?

320
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,220
好了 你们这些混蛋 上工
All right,you assholes,back to work!

321
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,970
嘿
Hey!

322
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:32,300
这不是乡村俱乐部 大明星
This ain't no country club,superstar.

323
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,490
快点
Move your ass!

324
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,690
不行 孩子 快点起床
No,son! You gotta get off the bunk!

325
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,250
天啊 起来
Man,for God's sake,get up!

326
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,860
快点 站起来 听我说
Come on,on your feet. Listen to me.

327
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:55,890
不到熄灯前五分钟 任何人都能上床
Nobody's allowed on the bunks till five minutes before lights out.

328
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,730
他们会把你烤了的
They'll put you in the oven.

329
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,650
天 这会害死你的
Man,that can kill ya!

330
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,310
吃晚餐了吗
Did you have any supper yet?

331
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,260
没有
No.

332
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:14,010
晚点我会给你弄点吃的
Later I'll try to get you some chow.

333
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:17,460
你得吃东西 不然会死的
You gotta eat,man, or you'll die of mono.

334
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,330
他们才不在乎
And they could care less!

335
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,470
滚开
Get off of me!

336
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:31,840
小心点 
Watch it,man!

337
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:32,650
你去哪
Where the hell you goin'?

338
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,480
快点 滚开
Come on! Move outta here!

339
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,900
一闪 一闪 大明星
Twinkle,twinkle,little superstar.

340
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,470
-看守  -怎么了
-Guard? -Yeah,boy?

341
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,640
我想见监狱长
I wanna see the Warden.

342
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,990
盐递给我
Pass the salt.

343
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,370
小子
Boy.

344
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,050
过来
Come on!

345
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,730
住手
Stop it.

346
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:28,780
你会被罚关在热房子里24小时的
That's gonna get you 24 hours in the hot box,boy.

347
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,530
老子不干了
I quit.

348
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,190
你怎么这么硬
What makes you so tough?

349
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,360
不知道 天生的
I don't know. It just comes natural.

350
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,240
你会赔上小命的 小子
That'll cost you,boy.

351
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,480
起床喜洋洋
Rise and shine!

352
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,320
起床喜洋洋
Rise and shine.

353
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,300
客房服务啊
It's room service.

354
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,890
很勇敢嘛
Pretty gamey.

355
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,310
洗个澡
Take a shower.

356
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,490
穿上干净的白衣服
Put on some clean whites.

357
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,110
监狱长要见你
The Warden wants to see ya. 

358
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,170
监狱长
The Warden?

359
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,510
去吧
Get on down there.

360
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,010
-准备  -怎么样
-Set! -Well?

361
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:56,410
-觉得我的球队如何  -很酷
-What do you think of my team? -Mean.

362
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:58,530
粗鲁但很酷
Crude but mean.

363
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:02,230
我一直想靠你 知道吧
I was depending on you,you know.

364
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,040
不过 现在时间不多了
Well,there's so little time left now.

365
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:08,680
这是个大问题
It's quite a problem.

366
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:13,040
第一场比赛前 他们需要点信心
They need something before that first game.

367
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,750
-你得打赢第一场球赛  -好
-You have to win the first game? -Right.

368
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,300
这很简单
That's relatively simple.

369
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,580
对 来一场调整赛
Yeah. Get yourself a tune-up game,you know?

370
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,900
什么
A what?

371
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,440
调整赛 就像专业球队那样
A tune-up game like the pros have.

372
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,140
你找一些球队之外
You find yourself some hungry

373
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,060
想打球的半专业球员
semi-pro team that's not in your league.

374
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,870
把他们带过来打败他们
You bring 'em in here and you kick the shit out of 'em.

375
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,860
那么...
Well...

376
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:42,440
你觉得和专业球队比赛怎么样
How do you think we'd do against the pros?

377
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,470
-这个球队和专业球员对打吗  -对
-That team against the pros? -Yeah.

378
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,370
天 那你有麻烦了
Oh,boy,you'd have a real problem.

379
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:52,720
那你觉得
Well,how do you think

380
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,620
和罪犯对打怎么样
we'd do against the cons?

381
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,540
我不知道罪犯还有球队
I didn't know the cons had a team.

382
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,140
他们没有
They don't.

383
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,900
但你给了我灵感
But you've given me an inspiration.

384
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,860
我决定 克鲁先生
I've decided,Mr. Crewe,

385
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:06,690
你给我组建一个球队
that you're gonna put one together for me.

386
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,140
为了这个调整赛
For that little tune-up game,you know?

387
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:12,700
你来打四分卫
And you're gonna play quarterback.

388
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,410
我做不到
I can't do that.

389
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,940
-为什么 他们可是半专业球队  -我们没有机会...
-Why not? They're semi-pro. -We wouldn't have a chance...

390
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,680
你自己说过 这是个大笑话
You said so yourself. It's a big joke.

391
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,080
所以大家喜欢我
That's why people like to have me around,

392
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,020
因为我有幽默感啊
because I have a sense of humor.

393
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,490
克鲁先生
Mr. Crewe,

394
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,590
就像老萨姆说的
as old Mr. Sam used to say,

395
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,470
"在这个机构
"In this institution,

396
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,840
为了生存 你就得适应"
to get along,you go along."

397
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:40,910
等一下 等等
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

398
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:44,060
我只想安静地度过剩下的18个月
I'm just gonna do what's left of my 18 months quietly,

399
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:47,980
-就离开这里  -对
-and I'm out of here. -Yes.

400
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,320
18个月
Eighteen months.

401
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:55,980
但那是假释
But that was to make parole.

402
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,600
是在你没有袭击诺尔队长的前提下
That was before you struck Captain Knauer.

403
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:07,220
你的刑罚是二至五年
Your basic sentence is from two to five years.

404
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:11,160
你可以在这里和我们待很久 克鲁先生
You could be here with us a long time,Mr. Crewe.

405
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,340
如果我组建好这个球队
If I get this team together,

406
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,720
要多久把他们训练好
how long do I have to get them organized?

407
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,530
四周
Four weeks.

408
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,740
能给我提前假释 是吧
We're talkin' about early parole,right?

409
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,990
是的
I believe we are.

410
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,530
好 我打
All right,I'll play.

411
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:39,170
什么 我没听到
What? I didn't hear you.

412
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,080
-我打  -"长官"
-I'll play. -"Sir."

413
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,940
我打 长官
I'll play,sir.

414
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,890
历史重演
History.

415
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,440
你就像一本书 克鲁先生
I read you like a book,Mr. Crewe.

416
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:57,910
-还有一件事  -是什么
-One more thing. -What is it?

417
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:01,290
别让诺尔在我背后捣乱
You keep Knauer off my back.

418
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,200
安排场球赛 克鲁先生
Give us a game,Mr. Crewe.

419
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,960
我会给你一场球赛
I'll give you a game.

420
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,720
"打与被打
"Hit and be hit.

421
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:16,820
任何有经验或意愿者
Anyone with any experience or desire.

422
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:19,580
皆可加入球队 签字加入"
Prison football team. Sign up."

423
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,370
你们觉得怎么样
Well,what do you think?

424
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,610
也许我会被打死 得了吧
Maybe I'll get annihilated. Forget it.

425
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:27,890
等等 等等 嘿
Wait a second. Wait a second. Hey!

426
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,900
我是这么看的
Here's the way I look at it.

427
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,340
假设你们因此断了腿脚
Suppose you break your leg or something like that.

428
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,150
就能轻松地在医院待六周
That's six weeks easy time in the hospital.

429
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:36,600
我觉得 这是好事啊
To me,that's biscuits and gravy.

430
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,230
告诉我
Tell me somethin'.

431
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,290
他们会让我拦截吗
Would they let me play tackle?

432
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,380
当然
Sure.

433
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,510
这表示我一半时间可以直视工头的眼睛 对吗
That means I spend half the time lookin' directly across into walking Boss' eyes,right?

434
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,340
你可以
Now you got it.

435
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,220
我一直看工头不顺眼
I always had a thing for Walking Boss.

436
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:52,990
对 工头也一直看你不顺眼
Yeah,and Walking Boss always had a thing for you.

437
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,010
等等 等等 看到这个
Hold it,hold it. Don't you guys know

438
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,590
你们就没看出点好处吗
a good thing when you see it?

439
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,500
你们可以随便揍看守
You get a free crack at the guards!

440
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,710
不用说 还有机会杀了他们
Not to mention, you have a chance to kill one of 'em!

441
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,770
-合法杀人  -胡说 我才不签这东西
-Legal! -Bullshit! I ain't signing that damn thing.

442
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:14,200
这个白鬼子棕肤色小子就出卖过自己的队友 不是吗
This honky golden boy sold out his own teammates,didn't he?

443
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,360
确实是
He damn sure did.

444
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:17,580
他做过一次 就再做一次
He did it once,he'll do it again!

445
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,010
-嗨  -嗨
-Hi. -Hi.

446
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,650
-你知道这样不行吧  -怎么
-You know you're doin' it all wrong? -Yeah?

447
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:42,100
对 有这群散沙 你永远都建不成球队
Yeah. You're never gonna put a team together with that bunch.

448
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,570
谢谢你的建议
Well,I appreciate the advice.

449
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:48,210
我可以帮你 我是纳特 斯卡伯勒
Well,I can help you. I'm Nate Scarboro.

450
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,520
-纳特 斯卡伯勒 巨人队的吗  -对
-Nate Scarboro,Giants? -Yeah.

451
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,320
请进
Step into my office.

452
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,400
谢谢
Thank you.

453
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:03,220
-我是保罗 克鲁  -对 我知道
-I'm Paul Crewe. -Yeah,I know.

454
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,150
你去年很风光 是吧
You made all pro your last year,didn't you?

455
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:06,950
对
Right.

456
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:09,660
-为什么不干了  -决定很简单
-Why'd you quit? -It was a simple decision.

457
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,580
医生说要么踢球要么走路
Doc said quit football or quit walking.

458
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,320
我的膝盖已经不能再做手术了
My knee had all the operations it could take.

459
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,890
我觉得走着比坐着强
I figured walking was better than sitting.

460
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,170
也许我选择错了
Maybe I made the wrong choice.

461
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:22,210
不管怎样 那里有15个人值得训练 剩下的...
Anyway,you got about 15 guys out there that are worth a damn. The rest...

462
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,820
哈森给你多长时间训练他们
How long did Hazen give you to get 'em ready?

463
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,560
一个月
A month.

464
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,160
你接了个艰巨任务啊
You bought a bill of goods.

465
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,160
别无选择
I didn't have any choice.

466
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:32,630
而且这里一个黑人队员都没有
And you don't have one black player out there.

467
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:36,660
这监狱至少有15个经验丰富的人 能组成球队
There are at least 15 in this prison with enough experience to make this club.

468
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:38,710
他们都不签
None of 'em signed up.

469
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:40,510
我在球队打了11年
I played 11 years in the league,

470
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,710
都没刮伤一下
never even got a hangnail.

471
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:45,160
我不会在这场比赛受伤
I'm not gonna get hurt in this game.

472
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,650
我要给自己找最强壮的人围住我
I'm gonna get myself the biggest guys i can find and surround myself.

473
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,590
我了解那些看守
I know the guards.

474
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,100
我看他们打了11年的球
I've watched them play for 11 years.

475
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:54,220
看到他们如何赢球 为什么输球
I've seen how they've won games and why they lost 'em.

476
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:58,230
我比那帮无赖自己都了解他们
I know those bums better than they know themselves.

477
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,890
你刚得到了一个工作 总教练
You just got yourself a job. Head coach.

478
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:06,910
你这里的人很好
Great bunch of guys you got here.

479
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:10,090
"掐死穿连裤袜的两个妻子"
"Strangled both wives with pantyhose."

480
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,730
"三重谋杀 包括人体肢解"
"Triple murder, including body dismemberment."

481
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,840
"用菜刀砍死母亲"
"Hacked mother with meat cleaver."

482
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:18,100
很好 很好
Charming,charming.

483
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,050
最好再查查上面标两颗星的人
Better double-check the ones with two stars on 'em

484
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,580
因为他们最暴力
because they're the most violent.

485
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,210
有三颗星的人吗
Got any with three stars?

486
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,170
该死的 监狱长
Damn it,Warden,

487
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,610
我觉得这场比赛是个大失误
I think this game's a big mistake.

488
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,400
队长 你不仅有机会
Captain,not only will you have the chance

489
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,060
磨练我们的队伍
to hone our team to a fine edge,

490
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:38,810
还有机会学到很多关于生命的意义
you'll also have the opportunity to learn a great deal about life.

491
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:41,180
你觉得为什么
Why is it,do you suppose,

492
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,540
我能走过这个被憎恨包围
that I can walk through this yard

493
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:49,890
却完全服从的院子
surrounded by hate and in total command?

494
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:54,120
因为围绕你的15座炮塔说 你可以
'Cause you got 15 gun turrets all around you that say you can.

495
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,480
有道理
Partly,partly.

496
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,780
他们可以立即拦住我们 抓住我们
They could stop us right now,grab us,

497
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,800
撕裂我们的喉咙
slit our throats.

498
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,580
但他们没有
But they don't.

499
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:11,160
我们安排的天时地利人和
We get the right person in the right place at the right time,

500
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,320
能吓得他们屁滚尿流
we can surprise the shit out of 'em,

501
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,640
就一场 一次
one game,one time.

502
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:17,700
-我们能做到  -你们完事了吗
-We can do it! -You guys about through?

503
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:19,200
时间快到了
Time's almost up.

504
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,040
好 波普 稳住
Okay,Pop. Hold your water.

505
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,670
你最好快点
You better hurry up.

506
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,020
你给我准备了什么 阳光小子
What have you got for me,sunshine?

507
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:27,620
能给你弄到激素 维他命 新人
I can get you steroids, vitamins,greenies.

508
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,880
任何东西 随便你说
Anything you want. You name it.

509
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,680
我是监狱最棒的皮条客
I'm the best hustler in the joint.

510
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:34,580
这家伙说的东西有多少能弄到
How much of what this guy says he can do can he do?

511
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,760
他能让你躺在这里...
He can get you laid in here...

512
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,210
和一个女人一起
With a woman.

513
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,150
-还要我怎么说  -是吗
-What more can I tell you? -Yeah?

514
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:47,340
好 你能给我弄到看守的医疗文件吗 
Yeah. But can you get me the medical files on the Guardsmen?

515
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,890
干什么
What for?

516
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,190
我想知道谁受过伤
I want to find out who had any broken bones.

517
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,600
桑尼 坦嫩
Sonny Tannen.

518
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,400
壮的跟牛一样 你会喜欢他的
Strong as an ox. You'll love him.

519
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:59,490
-这是他吗  -是他 对
-Is that him? -That's him. Yeah.

520
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,290
你好 桑尼
Hello,Sonny.

521
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,170
想打橄榄球吗
How'd you like to play some football?

522
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,940
橄榄球
Football?

523
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,160
对 想打吗
Yeah. Would you like that?

524
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:15,170
你是说 我们能打看守
You mean,we get to hit the guards?

525
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,530
就知道你喜欢 是吧 桑尼
Bet you'd like that,wouldn't you,Sonny?

526
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,060

-That makes sense. -Now,don't do any ethnic jokes.

535
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:05,910
就是让你离开这里
is get you transferred out of here

536
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,060
-上球场  -怎么做
-and on the football field. -How?

537
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,560
我们会想办法
We'll work on it.

538
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,040
很重吧
That pretty heavy?

539
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:26,740
大约400磅
About 400 pounds.

-确实很重  -乔治 萨姆森 格拉纳达
-That's pretty heavy. -George Samson Granada.

541

佛罗里达先生 1964年生
Mr. Florida,1964.

542
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,880

-你知道佛罗里达  -对 知道

544

这里有些厉害的警察
They got tough cops here.

545
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,940
个头不大但很壮实
Small but tough.

546
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:44,150
我们要办一场和看守对打的球赛
We're gettin' up a football game against the guards.

547
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,420
想着也许你和这里的朋友

你觉得怎么样
What do you think?

556
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:19,100
防守上我们能挡住他们两三个达阵
Defensively we can hold 'em to two or three touchdowns.

557
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,520
但还需要更好的接传球
But we need better pass receiving,

558
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:24,290
还要在球场上跑得快才能赢
and more speed in the backfield to win.

559
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,590
"赢"
"To win"?

560
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,580
我只是说能活下来
I'm just talking about surviving.

561
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,510
谁说赢了
Who's talking about winning?

562
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,420
我也是
So am I.

563
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,560
这对监狱长来说不只是场橄榄球赛
This just isn't a football game to the Warden.

564
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,140
他在羞辱你和这支球队
He shows you and this team up and he's

565
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:43,820
他在羞辱整个监狱
showin' up the whole prison population.

566
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,100
纳特 这只是场比赛
Nate,it's just a game.

567
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:50,340
我只想活着出来
All I wanna do is come out of it alive.

568
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,550
这只是场比赛
It's just a game.

569
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,560
不 对他来说不是的
No,not to him it isn't.

570
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:56,760
这是一门恐惧和暴力哲学
It's a fear and violence philosophy.

571
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,910
他给我们这个机会
He's given us this chance

572
00:41:58,050 --> 00:41:59,760
自由几个小时
to be free for a few hours,

573
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,480
试着再次成为男人
to try and be men again

574
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:03,650
所以他能摧毁我们
so he can destroy us.

575
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,800
纳特 如果你想着
Nate,if you're thinking

576
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:09,420
打赢这场比赛
about winning this game,

577
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,770
那你就和他一样疯了
then you're as crazy as he is.

578
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,970
也许吧
Maybe so.

579
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,970
但在这个水槽里待14年
But you spend 14 years in this tank,

580
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:19,300
你就开始明白
and you begin to understand

581
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,190
自己只剩下两件东西
that you've only got two things left

582
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,510
他们不能让你放弃
they can't sweat out of you

583
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,130
或打败你
or beat out of you.

584
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,350
你的胆量
Your balls.

585
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,730
你最好抓紧它们
And you better hang on to 'em,

586
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:28,620
因为这会是
because they're about

587
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,460
你离开这里的时候
the only thing you're gonna have

588
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,040
唯一拥有的东西
when you get out of here.

589
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,840
-晚安 纳特  -晚安
-Good night,Nate. -Good night.

590
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,970
厕所暂停使用两小时
The use of toilet facilities is suspended for two hours

591
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,240
直至修理结束
until repairs are completed.

592
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,010
抱歉 各位
Sorry,men.

593
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:21,250
-梅森  -好
-Mason. -Yeah.

594
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:22,750
跟我来 各位
Follow my lead,guys.

595
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:23,840
我们要教训教训这傻瓜
We're gonna do this sucker.

596
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:25,940
对 要是你们合得来 那才让人心塞
Yeah. If you get along,it'll be jamming.

597
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,720
也许再看看他想干嘛
Might as well see what this boy wants.

598
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:34,350
帅哥 我们知道你想干嘛
Pretty boy,we know what you want,man.

599
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:36,360
我们不打球
We don't play no ball.

600
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,340
你们打了啊
Figured you did.

601
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,990
-我们是打球 但补给你打  -就是
-Well,we do,but we don't. -There it is.

602
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:47,440
你们俩受过专门训练 是吧
You two guys were drafted by the pros,weren't you?

603
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,410
-对  -专业球员
-Yeah. -Pros

604
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:50,220
我懂 但你瞧
I understand that,but you see

605
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:53,250
我们不再打球给白鬼子取乐了
we no longer perform for the honky's amusement.

606
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,220
我说 我打
Say,man,I'll play.

607
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,100
但你得向我保证一件事
But you gotta guarantee me one thing.

608
00:43:58,230 --> 00:43:59,410
我就打
I'll start.

609
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,020
没问题
You got it.

610
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,140
好吧
All right.

611
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:04,000
你怎么回事 黑鬼
Say,man,what's wrong with you,nigger?

612
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:05,780
我们不跟他们打交道
We don't fuck with them.

613
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:07,320
我要打球
I'm gonna play football.

614
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:09,070
是 但不能跟白鬼子打啊
Yeah,but not with them honkies,man.

615
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,330
哥们 你最好离开
Say,man,you better leave.

616
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:12,300
晚点跟你谈
I'll talk to you later.

617
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,290
好 走 你最好快点走
Yeah,leave. You look better going than you did comin',anyway.

618
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,260
你怎么回事
What's wrong with you?

619
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:23,040
-我要打球  -听着 哥们...
-I'm gonna play football. -Look,brother...

620
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:25,590
小子 我才不是你哥们
Man,I ain't none of your goddamn brother.

621
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:27,030
知道吗 格兰维尔
You know what,Granville?

622
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:29,670
你什么都不是 就是个蠢蛋 傻瓜
You ain't nothin' but a big ol' dumb,stupid fool.

623
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:30,730
黑鬼 你就是个笨蛋
Nigger,you is a fool.

624
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:33,930
听着 我撞爆这些家伙的头
Look,it makes more sense me bangin' one of those big dudes upside the head

625
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:35,980
比撞爆你们的头更有意义
than to be bangin' you upside of yours.

626
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:38,630
黑鬼 拜托 该死的
Nigger,please! Shit!

627
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,040
他们在哪
Where are they?

628
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:43,700
再过五分钟才能到
They're not due for another five minutes. 

629
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,790
怎么了
What's the matter?

630
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,030
我们有大麻烦了 知道吗
We're in big trouble,you know that?

631
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,000
我弄了一堆小丑
I got a bunch of clowns.

632
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,780
都不知道他们是否打过高中球赛
I don't even know if they played high school football,

633
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:51,670
更别提大学球赛了
much less college football.

634
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:53,830
而且我们要和一个半专业队打
And we're playing a semi-pro team.

635
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,450
再加上 我都七年没碰球了
Plus the fact that I haven't picked up one of those things in about seven years.

636
00:44:57,610 --> 00:44:59,210
你担心什么
What're you worried about?

637
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,810
一旦练过 就永远不忘
Once you got it,you got it.

638
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:02,810
给那边的轮胎投个球
Throw one at that tire over there.

639
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:04,580
就像床事
Just like makin' love.

640
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:06,950
一旦做过 就再也忘不了
Once you've done it, you never forget how.

641
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:15,490
懂我的意思吧
See what I mean?

642
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,280
好 各位
All right,men,

643
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:20,300
我们没时间学习复杂的模式
we're not gonna have time to learn any complicated patterns.

644
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:23,390
所以我们要专注于基本的打法
So we're gonna concentrate on the basic plays.

645
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:27,720
但我们也许学过一点专业打法
But we might learn a few specialty plays,

646
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,300
懂我的意思吧
if you know what I mean.

647
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:40,150
自然地 我们要可能地逃跑
Now naturally we're gonna try to get away with as much as possible.

648
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,200
而我的执行助理


649
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:44,140
纳特 斯卡伯勒先生
Mr. Nate Scarboro,

650
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:47,200
会无比乐意
will be happy,more than happy,

651
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:52,050
教你们如何尝试逃跑
to show you just exactly how much you can try to get away with.

652
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,640
有一件事 你们要记住
The one thing that you're gonna have to remember,

653
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,610
最重要的一点
the one most important factor,

654
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:05,500
就是保护你们的四分卫 我
is to protect your quarterback,me!

655
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,850
等等 这不是瞎说
Wait a minute. That's no bullshit.

656
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,440
如果我出了事
If anything happens to me,

657
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:13,430
如果我受了伤
if I get hurt,

658
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,700
我们就得一辈子背负着这个事实
we're gonna have to live with the fact

659
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:17,670
就是我们曾有机会
that we had one chance,

660
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:19,370
千载难逢的机会
one chance in a million

661
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:21,880
羞辱这些混蛋
to humiliate those bastards,

662
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:24,290
而我们却搞砸了
and we blew it.

663
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:28,850
-明白了吗  -明白
-Is that clear? -Yeah!

664
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:30,820
好
All right.

665
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:32,560
现在 我们要打倒他们 对吗
Now,we're gonna hurt 'em,right?

666
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,070
对
Right!

667
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:36,130
好
All right.

668
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,670
我们要把他们打得屁滚尿流 对吗
We're gonna kick the shit out of 'em,right?

669
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:40,000
-对  -什么
-Right! -What?

670
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,150
对
Right!

671
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:44,500
对 好 好
Right! All right!

672
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,160
现在 跑位和端峰跟我来
Now,backs and ends come with me,

673
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:48,510
剩下的留在这里
the rest of you stay here.

674
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:52,570
好 排好队 快点 排好队
Okay,linemen. Come on,linemen!

675
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:59,860
-敏捷性评级写多少  -最高分10分
-What's the agility rating on this? -Maximum is 10.

676
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,490
好 各位 踩轮洞
All right,men,just hit the holes.

677
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,540
我不想听到你们碰到轮胎 膝盖抬起来
I don't wanna hear you hit any rubber. Knees high.

678
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,280

00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:51,030
十分
That's a ten.

691
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,480
好
All right,

692
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:55,980

Hut one! Hut two! Hut three!

-Sorry,man. -Nice tackle,Granville.

701
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:38,010
嘿 教练 你向我保证的那些
Hey,Coach,where the hell are all those

702

703
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,040

他来了 康尼 肖克
There he is,Connie Shokner.

705
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,930
监狱里的头号坏蛋

706
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:53,180
连看守都怕他

707

他在外面杀了五个人

徒手杀的
With his bare hands.

710
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,330
空手道很厉害
Karate's bad.

711
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:02,520
他当时还没学空手道
That's before he learned karate.

712
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:12,170
他现在在干嘛

没人有胆子问他
Nobody's ever had the guts to ask him.

714

-Paul,I wanna be manager. -Caretaker's manager.

719
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:32,560
我比他强
I'm better than he is.

720
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:34,020
让我向你证明吧
Let me prove it to you.

721
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,110
-走开 昂格尔  -滚开
-Beat it,Unger. -Fuck off!

722
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,540
保罗 你要怎么对付我
Paul,what have you got against me,anyway?

723
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:42,910
为什么不喜欢我
Why don't you like me?

724
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,240
我很喜欢你
I'm crazy about you.

725
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:46,280
觉得你很棒
I think you're terrific.

726
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:52,940
友谊是绝对不容轻视的 保罗
Friendship is something that should never be taken lightly,Paul.

727
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:56,190
我很想被人喜欢
I really want people to like me.

728
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:59,240
但他们从不喜欢我
But they never do.

729
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:07,650
我很想做你的朋友 保罗
I'd like very much to be your friend,Paul.

730
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:14,970
荣幸之至 昂格尔
Well,it'd be an honor and a privilege,Unger.

731
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:17,260
抱歉我离开一会
Now,if you'll just excuse me.

732
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:19,850
保罗
Paul?

733
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:23,090
你确定吗
You sure about that?

734
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,080
我不能当管理人吗
I can't be manager?

735
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:28,140
守护者是管理人
Caretaker's manager.

736
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:33,000
要是我早点找到你就好了
If I'd have only found you sooner, you know.

737
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:35,390
他喜欢你是好事
It's a good thing he loves you.

738
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:38,200
他烧了一座房子 烧死了五个不喜欢的人
He burnt down a house and roasted five people he didn't like.

739
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:40,360
我手上肯定沾了油灰
Putty in my hands.

740
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:45,410

Come out,boy,come out.

现在记住
Now remember,

752
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,250
谁都不能打四分卫
nobody hits the quarterback.

753
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:38,090
蓝28(战术代码)

他打断了我鼻子
He broke my fuckin' nose!

757
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:57,790
你个混蛋 你打断了我鼻子

00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:34,450
-不 他没有  -不 他有

00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,970

779
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:04,350
-再试一次  -三 45

好 球队剩下的人呢
All right. What about the rest of the team?

782
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:19,720
除了克鲁 唯一像样的是格兰维尔
Outside of Crewe,the only one who looks like anything is Granville.

783
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:21,920
格兰维尔能给你们造成大麻烦
Granville can give you real trouble.

784
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:23,860
好 昂格尔 行了
All right,Unger,that's all.

785
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:43,050
-怎么样  -这会是个集中营狩猎
-Well? -It's gonna be a turkey shoot.

786
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:45,620
他说得对 长官 我们要摧毁他们
He's right,sir. We're gonna destroy 'em.

787
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,610
这是个契机 工头 这是个契机
It's a cinch,boss. It's a cinch.

788
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:52,120
"契机" "摧毁他们"
"A cinch." "Destroy 'em."

789
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:55,840
很好
Too cute.

790
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:01,840
去年输给安娜克钢铁之前
That's what y'all said last year before

791
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:04,490
你们就是这么说的 记得吗
we lost to Anacott Steel,remember?

792
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:07,750
我们没必要
There's no sense us taking any chances,

793
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,770
让自己受伤
lettin' ourselves get hurt.

794
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:12,810
看看怎么对付格兰维尔
So see what we can do about Granville.

795

796
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,490
嘿 格兰维尔 过来
Hey,Granville,get your ass over here.

797
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,760
是 长官 警官
Yes,sir,Lieutenant.

798
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:31,940
你觉得自己该干什么 小子
What the hell you think you're doin',boy?

799
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:34,070
你把这个捡起来

800
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,020
是 长官
Yes,sir.

801
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:46,230
你怎么回事 胖子
Now,what is your problem,fat man?

802
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:50,000
知道你们这些黑桃为什么总彼此称呼"哥们"吗
Know why you spades is always calling each other "brother"?

803
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:51,500
不知道 长官
No,sir.

804
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:53,310
因为你们大部分都不知道自己的爹是谁
'Cause half of you don't know who your daddy is,

805
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:56,450
所以你们可能是兄弟
so you just might be brothers.

806
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:07,970
是 长官 警官
Yes,sir,Lieutenant.

807
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,960
你觉得这很好笑 是吧
Now you think that's funny,don't you?

808
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:11,200
是 长官

809
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,090
而且你想揍我 是吧
And you wanna hit me,don't you?

810
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:15,450
谁 我吗 没有 长官 警官
Who,me? No,sir,Lieutenant.

811
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:17,582
你蠢到连别人叫你愚蠢
You're too goddamn ignorant to know 

812
00:55:17,583 --> 00:55:20,540
没教养的黑鬼都不懂
when a man's calling you a stupid,uneducated nigger.

813
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,060
是 长官 警官
Yes,sir,Lieutenant.

814
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:31,730
我现在可以走了吗 长官
May I go now,sir?

815
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:35,270
好 滚开
Yeah! Get out of my sight!

816
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:54,180
蓝48(战术代码)
Blue 48!

817
00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:57,760
蓝48
Blue 48!

818
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:01,570
准备 发球
Set! Hut one!

819
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,440
该死
Shit.

820
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:15,670
嘿 白人
Hey,white white!

821
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:18,690
这是搞什么
What the hell is this?

822
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,740
山雨欲来
Here come the rain clouds.

823
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:22,590
他们想干嘛
What the fuck do they want?

824
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,830
格兰尼告诉我们你需要帮忙
Granny tells us you need a little help.

825
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:29,130
说你能保证我们没有劳动惩罚
Says you can guarantee us no work detail.

826
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,380
是的
Yeah.

827
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:36,000
保证我们像格兰尼一样有好的食物
Guarantee us special food like Granny gets?

828
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:37,600
是
Yeah.

829
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:40,180
我们能像格兰尼说的那样打这些该死的看守
We get to hit those damn guards like Granny said we would?

830
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,010
你们能打他们
You get to hit 'em.

831
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:47,720
我们还能为他们提供什么
What else can we offer 'em?

832
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:50,180
我猜他们要开个日内瓦会议
I guess they gonna have a Geneva Conference.

833
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,700
这是什么胡话
What is this bullshit?

834
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,370
那么 克鲁先生
Well,Mr. Crewe,

835
00:56:57,570 --> 00:56:59,990
看来我们意见一致了

836
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:02,650
芝加哥青年局在此致贺
Compliments from the Greater Chicago Youth Authority.

837

There goes the neighborhood.

838
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,950
你想见我
You wanted to see me?

839
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:29,970
是 长官
Yes,sir.

840
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:36,250
特别是昂格尔
And especially Unger.

841
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:38,200
-昂格尔  -对
-Unger? -Yeah.

842
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:42,020
昂格尔直接向诺尔队长告密
Unger has a direct pipeline to Captain Knauer.

843
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:44,000
只要有昂格尔在
It's impossible for me to have a secret

844
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:46,170
我不可能秘密训练
practice as long as Unger's around.

845
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:52,230
我应该为了连续三小时的秘密训练
I'm supposed to reschedule the yard activities

846
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:55,660
重新安排院子里的活动
for three uninterrupted hours of secret practice.

847
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:56,520
是 长官
Yes,sir.

848
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:58,500
-对吗  -对
-That's right? -Right.

849
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:00,980
而且你会和诺尔队长谈
And you will talk to Captain Knauer?

850
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:03,980
我会和队长谈这两件事 对
I'll speak to the captain on both those matters,yes.

851
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,510
谢谢 长官
Thank you,sir.

852
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:11,450
克鲁先生 你藏着什么锦囊妙计呢
Mr. Crewe,just what is it you have up your sleeve?

853
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:14,290
我只是想给你一个球队 监狱长
I'm just trying to give you a football team,Warden.

854
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:20,800
顺便 也许给这些人一些骄傲和自尊
And along the way,maybe give the men some pride and some dignity.

855
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,910
当然 只是暂时的
Of course,only for a little while.

856
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:27,890
我知道你脑子里
I know you've got something more

857
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:31,770
还有别的电子
bouncing around inside that head of yours.

858
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:34,080
你想要一场比赛 对吗
You want a game,right?

859
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:39,780
我的人没机会赢这场比赛
My men don't have a chance in hell of winnin' that game.

860
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:41,850
你知 我知
You know it,I know it.

861
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:46,720
我只是不想让他们知道 好吗
I just don't want them to know it. Okay?

862
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:56,840
天 我五年没吃过这样的牛排了
Man! I ain't eat steak like this in five years!

863
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:59,750
我都六年没"吃"了
I ain't "et" inside in six.

864
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,220
我晚点有什么安排
What've you done for me lately?

865
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:09,240
今天也许是这个漫长而丰富多彩的职业生涯中的至高点
Today may be the high point of a long and colorful career.

866
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:10,920
三个
Three... Count 'em,

867
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,720
三个伟大的奢侈品
three gigantic rip-offs.

868
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,790
第一 我弄到了一箱崭新的设备
First,I've got a box of brand-new equipment

869
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:16,840
就等着藏起来
just waitin' to be stashed.

870
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,810
相当于诺尔队长的祝贺
Compliments of Captain Knauer,no less.

871
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:19,980
差不多
No less.

872
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:22,300
还有主菜
And the piece de resistance.

873
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:23,920
让"冷血机器"
How would you like the Mean Machine

874
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,400
得到看守真正参赛的录像怎么样
to have actual game films of the Guardsmen in action?

875
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,320
你能做到吗
Can you do that?

876
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,580
监狱长的独家影片
Warden's very own home movies.

877
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:33,480
守护者 你可别耍我了
Caretaker, you never cease to amaze me.

878
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,890
没有
Never.

879
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:37,040
但你说三个重要的奢侈品
But you said three gigantic rip-offs.

880
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:38,810
这只有两个
That's only two.

881
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,430
你肯定不想毁掉这个惊喜
Well,you don't want to ruin the surprise.

882
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:41,780
"惊喜"
"Surprise"?

883
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:44,380
-还有一件事  -是什么
-There is one thing though. -What's that?

884
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:48,750
你要进行一场私人...服务
You're gonna have to perform a personal... Service.

885
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:55,440
什么样的私人服务
What kind of personal service?

886
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:05,840
监狱长在等你
The Warden's expecting you.

887
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:07,940
这边请
Won't you come this way?

888
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,610
-谢谢你 队长  -谢谢
-Thank you,Captain. -Thank you.

889
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:19,890
很高兴你不再待在沼泽地了
I'm glad you're not in the swamp

890
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:21,790
那能毁了一个人
anymore. That can ruin a man.

891
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:24,700
是的
Sure can.

892
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:27,160
我们时间不多
We don't have a great deal of time.

893
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,410
有15分钟
We have 15 minutes.

894
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:36,090
-比赛录像  -谢谢 太好了
-The game films. -Thank you. That's terrific.

895
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:43,480
就像我说的 我们只有15分钟
Like I said,we only have 15 minutes.

896
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:05,750
不用开手铐
Won't go over the cuffs.

897
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,590
你经常这么做吗
You do this very often?

898
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:17,850
跟你一样很久没有了
I'm just as far from Tallahassee as you are,honey.

899
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,000
肖克
Shokner!

900
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,860
-肖克  -怎么了
-Shokner! -Yeah?

901
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:34,150
你像这样从上方攻击他
You hit him high like that,

902
01:01:34,310 --> 01:01:36,070
他会折断你的背
he's gonna break your back.

903
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,150
折断你的背
Breaks your back,

904
01:01:38,350 --> 01:01:40,490
就会折断大明星的背
gonna break the superstar's back.

905
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:42,250
不用担心他
Don't worry about him.

906
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:44,750
我会拿下那混蛋
I'll get that son of a bitch with an "M.P."

907
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,080
-加油  -加油
-Keeyai! -Keeyai!

908
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:49,880
-准备 开始  -加油
-Ready. Set. -Keeyai!

909
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:52,740
-准备 开始  -加油
-Ready. Set. -Keeyai!

910
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,570
你们拿着这绷带
You take this bandage.

911
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:56,850
你们浸在熟石膏里
You dip into the plaster of Paris.

912
01:01:57,010 --> 01:01:58,470
用它缠住石膏
You wrap it around the cast,

913
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:02,560
15分钟后就变得跟石头一样硬 明白吗
and in 15 minutes it becomes as hard as a rock. You got it?

914
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:03,940
明白
Got it!

915
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:06,740
-这是一张工头的片子  -好
-This is a picture of the Walking Boss. -Yeah!

916
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,810
他的右股骨曾断过
He once broke his right femur.

917
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:10,850
这是他的股骨
That's his thighbone.

918
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:12,230
也许你们可以给他点厉害
Maybe you can give him a clip or somethin'.

919
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:13,150
我们再让他断一次
We'll break it again.

920
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,100
-明白吗 好 我们能行  -明白
-Got it? Right! We can do it! -Got it!

921
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,440
好 我们能行
All right. We can do it.

922
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:20,100
先生们 一般来说这个东西
Gentlemen,what we have here in common parlance

923
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,120
是一组指节铜环
is known as a set of brass knuckles.

924
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:25,450
现在讲临时残疾
Now,temporary disabilities.

925
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:29,250
老二 内脏 肋骨
Balls,gut,ribs.

926
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,470
-明白吗  -明白
-You got it? -Got it!

927
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:34,120
球被抢后你们就出击
The ball is snapped and you go into your point,

928
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:36,320
追上他 用左臂拦住他
go into him blocking him with your left arm

929
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:39,050
用这只手打向他的下巴
and bring this hand up into his chin,

930
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:40,540
我向你们保证 先生们
and I'll guarantee you,gentlemen,

931
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:43,980
他接下来几个月都不能行动
that he will be incapacitated for the next several moments.

932
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:45,780
-明白了吗 好  -明白
-You got it? Okay. -Got it!

933
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:47,160
好了 各位
All right,men,

934
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,550
这是我们要用的战术
now here's the play we're gonna use.

935
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:52,420
看守应该不知道
I don't think the guards know this formation.

936
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:54,240
这叫"偶然的惩罚"
It's called "Incidental punishment,"

937
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:56,400
然后老二就完蛋了
after the ball is blown dead.

938
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:58,640
记住 你拦截的所有人
Remember,any man you tackle

939
01:02:58,790 --> 01:03:00,790
都要被打一胳膊 顶一膝盖
gets an extra elbow,knee,

940
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:02,380
或嘴上挨一脚
or kick in the mouth.

941
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:04,370
-明白吗  -明白
-Got it? -Got it!

942
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:12,010
毫无疑问
I am,without a doubt,

943
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:17,010
整个监狱 就数我的葡萄酒酿的最好
the finest maker of raisin jack in the entire joint.

944
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:20,150
我要把这批酒命名为奥勒守护者
I'm gonna call this batch Ole Caretaker.

945
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:23,930
你一直都放在那吗
You always keep it in there?

946
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:28,150
不过 这里好像很合适
Well,it seems like a logical place.

947
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:32,650
听着...
Listen...

948
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,270
你和我是兄弟 是吧
You and me are buddies,ain't we?

949
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:39,600
我让你享艳福
I got you laid.

950
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,010
给你弄到比赛录像
I got you the game films.

951
01:03:42,170 --> 01:03:44,630
给你召集这些魔鬼
I got you all them monsters.

952
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,260
让你大醉一场
I'm gettin' you drunk.

953
01:03:46,450 --> 01:03:48,840
确实
That you are.

954
01:03:50,010 --> 01:03:52,000
所以 我还是有件事不明白
So,one thing still bothers me. 

955
01:03:52,190 --> 01:03:53,630
什么
What's that?

956
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,350
为什么故意输球
Why'd you shave them points?

957
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:01,640
告诉你了 为了钱
I told you. For the money.

958
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:05,010
不 不 我是说... 得了吧
No,no,I mean... Come on.

959
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,500
告诉我真正的原因
Give me the real reason.

960
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:09,910
你真想知道吗
You really wanna know?

961
01:04:12,110 --> 01:04:14,710
我从来都不在乎橄榄球
I never gave a shit about football,

962
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:16,880
或任何别的东西
or anything else.

963
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:20,360
我唯一在乎的是 我老爹
The only thing I ever cared about's my old man.

964
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:25,690
我老爹是瞎子
My old man was blind.

965
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:28,770
他从没看过我比赛
He never saw me play.

966
01:04:30,310 --> 01:04:34,280
我从12岁就是职业运动员
Shit,I've been a professional ever since I was 12 years old.

967
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:37,990
打台球骗钱
Hustlin' nickels and dimes playin' pool.

968
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:42,160
只想赚够钱照顾他
Just trying to make enough money to take care of him.

969
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,550
我以为等我成了顶尖球员
I figured when I got to pro ball,

970
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,650
就能大赚一笔
I'd make one big killin'.

971
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:52,940
打发一笔
One big one.

972
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:58,050
赚到足够的钱 安置他
Make enough money,set him up.

973
01:04:59,150 --> 01:05:02,170
照顾他颐养天年
Take care of him the rest of his life.

974
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:06,450
而这混蛋却死了
And the son of a bitch up and died on me.

975
01:05:10,130 --> 01:05:11,630
你相信吗
You buy that?

976
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:19,110
不过这很好 因为这也是胡说八道
Well,that's good, because that's bullshit too.

你们自称橄榄球队吗
You call yourselves a football team?

1213
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:37,400
就是一群懦夫
You're a bunch of candy-asses!

1214
01:22:37,590 --> 01:22:39,260
他们现在正嘲笑你们呢

他可有两下子 哥们
He's a big shot out there,man!

1218
01:22:46,390 --> 01:22:47,150
他们只领先两分
They're only two points up.

1219
01:22:47,310 --> 01:22:48,950
我们第二局就拿下他们
We'll take 'em in the second.

1220
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:04,140
你觉得自己在干什么
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?

1221
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,590
你想要一场比赛 就得到了
You wanted a game,you got one.

1222
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:08,810
我从没说过要赢

1223
01:23:08,970 --> 01:23:11,290
也没说要输啊
Never said anything about losing,either.

1224
01:23:13,770 --> 01:23:16,310
我给你说清楚
I'll spell it out for you.

1225
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:18,480
我们拘留了昂格尔
We've got Unger in custody.

1226
01:23:18,630 --> 01:23:22,070
-他坦白杀了守护者  -什么
-He's confessed to killing Caretaker. -What?

1227

他说你全都知道
He said you knew all about it.

1228
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:26,830
你没告知诺尔队长
You didn't notify Captain Knauer,

1229
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:31,760
这样你就成了从犯
and that makes you an accessory.

1230
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,080
胡说八道
You're full of crap.

1231
01:23:33,210 --> 01:23:37,270
克鲁先生 是你让守护者去那间牢房
Mr. Crewe,you sent Caretaker to that cell.

1232
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:39,910
你是谋杀案的从犯
You are an accessory to murder.

1233
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:43,130
你可以被判20年...
You could be looking at 20 years...

1234
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:44,420
慢慢熬
And counting.

1235
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:45,690
胡说 这个世界上你根本不可能
Bullshit! There's no way in the world

1236
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:47,270
在法庭上证明这点
you could make that stick in court.

1237
01:23:47,420 --> 01:23:49,030
不能吗
No?

1238
01:23:49,180 --> 01:23:53,550
克鲁先生 你可能在这个监狱待到满头白发
Mr. Crewe,you could be in this institution until you are old and gray.

1239
01:23:53,710 --> 01:23:54,700
或者直到你死
Or until you're dead,

1240
01:23:54,850 --> 01:23:55,600
只会是这两个结果
whichever comes first.

1241
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:57,560
我可以向你保证
I can promise you that.

1242
01:23:57,740 --> 01:24:00,170
你要输掉比赛
You're gonna lose the game.

1243
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:05,180
而且...我要21分
And... I want a 21-point spread.

1244
01:24:06,570 --> 01:24:09,540
我做不到
I can't do that!

1245
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:12,560
你当然可以
Of course you can.

1246
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:16,930
你之前就做过
You've done it before.

1247
01:24:20,090 --> 01:24:22,310
如果我给你21分
If I give you the 21 points,

1248
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:26,190
你能放过他们吗
will you call off the dogs?

1249
01:24:30,990 --> 01:24:32,960
"他们"
"The dogs"?

1250
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:35,390
如果你掌握了这场比赛
If you got the game in the bag,

1251
01:24:35,540 --> 01:24:37,860
就让你的人放他们一马

1527
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:39,330

There you go,Nate. There you are.


1528
01:40:39,510 --> 01:40:41,860

I heard you were on your way in.


1529
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:48,720

Hey,he tell you about my touchdown?


1530
01:40:48,870 --> 01:40:50,370

Ladies and gentlemen,


1531
01:40:50,540 --> 01:40:52,200

with five minutes and four seconds left


1532
01:40:52,350 --> 01:40:53,300

in the fourth quarter,


1533
01:40:53,470 --> 01:40:55,840

there is now only an eight-point difference.


1534
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:01,270

Here we go.


1535
01:41:01,410 --> 01:41:03,750

Blue Eyes,can you drop-kick from here?


1536
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:06,120

-I can try. -"Drop-kick"?


1537
01:41:06,340 --> 01:41:07,460

It's fourth and four.


1538
01:41:07,630 --> 01:41:08,920

We're gonna drop-kick.


1539
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:11,880

Shotgun,drop-kick on one.


1540
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:13,250

-Ready? -Break!


1541
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:23,710

The ball goes back to Charlie "Blue Eyes."


1542
01:41:23,810 --> 01:41:26,990

Charlie "Blue Eyes" drop-kicked!


1543
01:41:29,710 --> 01:41:31,270

I haven't seen one of those in 25 years.


1544
01:41:31,270 --> 01:41:31,850

-How 'bout it,Ref? -Good as gold.


1545
01:41:31,850 --> 01:41:33,760

-What the hell was that? -That was a drop-kick.


1546
01:41:33,910 --> 01:41:34,910

-"Drop-kick"? -Drop-kick.


1547
01:41:35,060 --> 01:41:36,100

How much does that count?


1548
01:41:36,230 --> 01:41:36,740

-Three points. -"Three points"?


1549
01:41:36,910 --> 01:41:41,580

-Three points. -For that? Bullshit!


1550
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:46,650

The score stands Guards 35,Mean Machine 30.


1551
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:48,210

It's fourth and 21 for the Mean Machine


1552
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:50,030

on their own 39-yard line.


1553
01:41:50,210 --> 01:41:52,760
Crewe is screening.


1554
01:41:52,950 --> 01:41:54,720
He dumps it off on the pass.


1555
01:42:04,070 --> 01:42:07,020
Bogdanski saves a touchdown.


1556
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:08,980
Bogdanski is really wreaking havoc


1557
01:42:09,130 --> 01:42:11,050
on that Mean Machine team.


1558
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:14,310
All right,quiet down.


1559
01:42:14,450 --> 01:42:16,470
Listen to me. Listen to me!


1560
01:42:16,670 --> 01:42:18,220
We're gonna let Bogdanski come right through. 


1561
01:42:18,350 --> 01:42:20,720
Nobody touch that big mother.You got it? 


1562
01:42:20,870 --> 01:42:22,100
I wanna try somethin'.I wanna try somethin' now.


1563
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:25,480
And if it works,everybody hit him,right?


1564
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:26,870
Right!


1565
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:31,110
-Split right,ball curl,on one. Ready? -Break!


1566
01:42:31,290 --> 01:42:32,260
Left!


1567
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:35,620
Blue 69.


1568
01:42:35,810 --> 01:42:38,890
Blue 69.


1569
01:42:39,090 --> 01:42:41,290
Set.


1570
01:42:42,130 --> 01:42:43,190
Hut!


1571
01:42:57,290 --> 01:42:59,820
They're tangled now.


1572
01:42:59,990 --> 01:43:01,550
There is a penalty of 15 yards


1573
01:43:01,690 --> 01:43:02,840
against the Mean Machine


1574
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:04,260
for unnecessary roughness.


1575
01:43:04,430 --> 01:43:09,250
That pass sure didn't look like it was an accident.


1576
01:43:09,390 --> 01:43:11,410
Bogdanski is staggering,but he is up.


1577
01:43:11,550 --> 01:43:13,370
He is up and on his feet.


1578
01:43:13,530 --> 01:43:15,510
Okay,we got 15. Huddle up on the ball.


1579
01:43:15,690 --> 01:43:17,420
Come on,let's huddle up.


1580
01:43:18,370 --> 01:43:19,610
Huddle up!


1581
01:43:26,030 --> 01:43:27,870
Unbelievable.


1582
01:43:35,940 --> 01:43:37,710
Bog,come on,get yourself outta here.


1583
01:43:37,890 --> 01:43:40,190
-Come on! -I know what I'm doin'!


1584
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:43,180
Worked once. Oughta work again,right?


1585
01:43:44,310 --> 01:43:47,390
All right. One more... One more time.


1586
01:43:47,540 --> 01:43:49,310
-On two. Ready? -Break!


1587
01:43:49,490 --> 01:43:51,950
It is third and 32 for the Mean Machine.


1588
01:43:58,350 --> 01:43:59,880
Set.


1589
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:02,030
-Hut! -Paul goes back.


1590
01:44:02,190 --> 01:44:03,350
He passes.


1591
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:08,270
Crewe hits Bogdanski with the ball right in the...


1592
01:44:08,410 --> 01:44:10,010
In the nether region.


1593
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:30,550
He's not breathing.


1594
01:44:30,730 --> 01:44:31,720
Well,do somethin',man.


1595
01:44:31,860 --> 01:44:32,770
Try mouth-to-mouth.


1596
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:34,140
You want to?


1597
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:36,910
No way.


1598
01:44:37,090 --> 01:44:38,850
Ambulance. Help!


1599
01:44:40,100 --> 01:44:43,600
They're taking Bogdanski off the field in an ambulance.


1600
01:44:43,790 --> 01:44:45,000
What a...


1601
01:45:00,230 --> 01:45:01,200
Set. 


1602
01:45:02,180 --> 01:45:03,920
Hut!Hut.


1603
01:45:09,340 --> 01:45:11,780
He pushed off! He pushed off!


1604
01:45:16,090 --> 01:45:19,370
You can't see,you blind son of a bitch!


1605
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:21,800
-What's goin' on here? God damn it! -Walking Boss.


1606
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:23,740
Here's your cryin' towel.


1607
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:26,040
You big,fat-ass son of a bitch!


1608
01:45:26,230 --> 01:45:28,940
-You get off this field! -Goddamn!


1609
01:45:30,670 --> 01:45:32,200
First down.


1610
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:34,520
Time out. Time out.


1611
01:45:34,690 --> 01:45:36,280
Jesus!


1612
01:45:36,450 --> 01:45:39,010
Come on,let's go. Let's take it in.


1613
01:45:39,150 --> 01:45:40,360
Spooner,you wanna hit somebody?


1614
01:45:41,050 --> 01:45:43,750
All right,all right. Tackle eligible.


1615
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:46,840
Mawabe,talk to me.


1616
01:45:47,020 --> 01:45:47,770
-Yeah? -What are you gonna do?


1617
01:45:47,930 --> 01:45:49,180
I'll step one step off the line.


1618
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:50,210
I'll step on it.


1619
01:45:50,350 --> 01:45:52,140
-All right,on one. Ready? -Break!


1620
01:45:52,290 --> 01:45:54,890
Machine's ball,first and ten on the Guards' 31-yard line.


1621
01:45:55,100 --> 01:45:58,100
Blue 28. Blue 28.


1622
01:45:58,260 --> 01:46:01,900
A tense moment with less than a minute,57 seconds left to go.


1623
01:46:02,090 --> 01:46:03,090
Hut!


1624
01:46:09,330 --> 01:46:11,070
Spooner goes down on the one-yard line.


1625
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:13,370
Protest that play!


1626
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:25,130
Hey,Crewe,call time. Call time.


1627
01:46:25,290 --> 01:46:27,060
Time! Time,Ref.


1628
01:46:27,220 --> 01:46:28,690
Time! Time!


1629
01:46:28,850 --> 01:46:31,880
It's first and goal to go on the one-yard line


1630
01:46:32,020 --> 01:46:33,470
as Crewe calls time out


1631
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:36,190
with 40 seconds left on the clock.


1632
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:38,470
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!


1633
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:43,240
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!


1634
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:47,100
We got no time. Quiet down.


1635
01:46:47,270 --> 01:46:48,710
Split right.


1636
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:51,630
Joe Jackson,split right,sweep left.


1637
01:46:51,790 --> 01:46:53,380
-On one. Ready? -Break!


1638
01:46:54,870 --> 01:46:58,150
Blue 28. Blue 28.


1639
01:46:58,300 --> 01:47:00,090
Set. Hut!


1640
01:47:02,620 --> 01:47:04,040
Steps out of bounds to stop the clock,


1641
01:47:04,210 --> 01:47:07,180
25 seconds left to go.


1642
01:47:07,330 --> 01:47:08,110
Ladies and gentlemen,


1643
01:47:08,310 --> 01:47:09,820
this is really a ball game.


1644
01:47:09,970 --> 01:47:11,420
This is a great ball team.


1645
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:12,360
They're out here,


1646
01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:13,140
and they're giving these Guardsmen


1647
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:15,070
the fight of their lives.


1648
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:19,480
Hold up.Hold up.


1649
01:47:19,640 --> 01:47:22,200
Split right,roll out right,option pass.


1650
01:47:22,370 --> 01:47:23,370
Be waitin',Mason.


1651
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:25,420
-On two. On two. Ready? -Break!


1652
01:47:25,580 --> 01:47:28,760
-Second and goal. -Blue 28.


1653
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:31,060
Blue 28. Set.


1654
01:47:32,300 --> 01:47:33,030
Hut!


1655
01:47:33,180 --> 01:47:33,950
Hut!


1656
01:47:34,100 --> 01:47:35,320
Ball goes back to Crewe.


1657
01:47:35,460 --> 01:47:36,240
He fades to pass.


1658
01:47:36,410 --> 01:47:39,820
He throws. He just overthrows Mason in the end zone.


1659
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:43,540
Stopping the clock again with 16 seconds left.


1660
01:47:43,940 --> 01:47:46,140
I'm sorry. Here we go.


1661
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:48,700
Boot right,dive left again.


1662
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:50,650
Listen,if we don't make it,


1663
01:47:50,810 --> 01:47:51,880
everybody yell,"Time."


1664
01:47:52,010 --> 01:47:53,240
Everybody yell "Time." On one. Ready?


1665
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:54,070
Break!


1666
01:47:58,730 --> 01:48:03,080
Blue 29. Blue 29. Set.


1667
01:48:04,030 --> 01:48:04,850
Hut!


1668
01:48:09,590 --> 01:48:10,830
Time! Time!


1669
01:48:13,230 --> 01:48:15,940
And Crewe calls for his third and last time-out


1670
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:18,670
with seven seconds left on the clock.


1671
01:48:22,870 --> 01:48:24,720
Where the hell is he goin'?


1672
01:48:26,260 --> 01:48:28,480
Come on. Let's find out.


1673
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:30,090
Crewe has taken his last time-out,


1674
01:48:30,260 --> 01:48:33,040
and he's heading toward the Mean Machine bench.


1675
01:48:33,220 --> 01:48:34,730
He's heading towards the Mean Machine bench


1676
01:48:34,870 --> 01:48:38,710
followed by the entire offensive unit of the Mean Machine.


1677
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:41,350
Most unusual,ladies and gentlemen.


1678
01:48:41,530 --> 01:48:43,050
I don't know what they're doing down there. 


1679
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:45,320
It's silent as a church.


1680
01:48:45,530 --> 01:48:48,130
It looks more like a prayer meeting


1681
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:49,540
than it does like a huddle.


1682
01:48:49,700 --> 01:48:50,750
Whatever happens,


1683
01:48:50,910 --> 01:48:52,290
regardless of the outcome,


1684
01:48:52,440 --> 01:48:55,440
this has been one fantastic showing.


1685
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:57,790
We've come too far together to stop now.


1686
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:01,430
For Granny,for Nate...


1687
01:49:04,110 --> 01:49:05,720
For Caretaker.


1688
01:49:07,010 --> 01:49:08,160
Let's do it!


1689
01:49:14,420 --> 01:49:19,230
The Mean Machine! The Mean Machine!


1690
01:49:23,300 --> 01:49:25,750
Blue 44.


1691
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:28,740
Blue 44.


1692
01:49:30,710 --> 01:49:31,710
Set.


1693
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:36,020
The Mean Machine! The Mean Machine!


1694
01:49:38,190 --> 01:49:41,850
That's enough! Hold it down!


1695
01:49:44,280 --> 01:49:45,280
Set.


1696
01:49:47,910 --> 01:49:48,660
Hut!


1697
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:20,750
36,35 in favor of the Mean Machine!


1698
01:51:29,550 --> 01:51:30,860
Ladies and gentlemen,


1699
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:33,140
like the fabled phoenix of old...


1700
01:51:33,330 --> 01:51:38,170
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!


1701
01:52:19,510 --> 01:52:22,760
-You guys ain't half bad. -You're right.


1702
01:52:27,200 --> 01:52:29,140
Fuck you,boy.


1703
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:31,940
Not today,boss.


1704
01:52:39,780 --> 01:52:42,230
History!


1705
01:52:42,470 --> 01:52:43,230
We stopped 'em.


1706
01:52:43,380 --> 01:52:45,870
We could be number one. We are number one!


1707
01:52:55,550 --> 01:52:58,040
Where's your goddamn power theory now?


1708
01:52:58,850 --> 01:53:00,640
He's tryin' to escape.


1709
01:53:00,830 --> 01:53:03,550
-Bullshit. -Officer!


1710
01:53:03,750 --> 01:53:06,810
-Crewe! -I'm talking to you!


1711
01:53:08,350 --> 01:53:09,590
Crewe!


1712
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:12,610
He's trying to escape. Here,shoot him!


1713
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:13,610
Crewe!


1714
01:53:13,770 --> 01:53:15,380
You gonna let him get away? Shoot him!


1715
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:17,010
-Crewe. -Shoot him,you...


1716
01:53:17,170 --> 01:53:18,880
-Crewe! -Shoot him!


1717
01:53:20,090 --> 01:53:21,810
-Crewe! -Kill him!


1718
01:53:21,990 --> 01:53:25,220
Kill that son of a bitch! Shoot him.


1719
01:53:45,510 --> 01:53:47,730
Game ball.


1720
01:54:02,180 --> 01:54:04,750
Stick this in your trophy case.


1721
01:54:10,440 --> 01:54:12,830
I knew you could do it!


1722
01:55:55,100 --> 01:55:58,973
