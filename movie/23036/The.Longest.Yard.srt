1
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,270
嘿,美女
Hey, sexy.

2
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,910
我喜欢那裙子
I love that dress.

3
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,080
当然啦,洛伦佐 这就是你做的
Of course you do, Lorenzo. You made it.

4
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,810
- 嗨,甜心 - 你们好
- Hi, sweetie. - Hey, guys.

5
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,580
- 你在那儿啊 - 莉娜
- There you are. - Lena.

6
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,520
- 你又干成了 - 哦,都是为了你啊,布拉德利
- You've done it again. - Well, it's all for you, Bradlee.

7
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,050
该过去玩玩了
Gotta mingle.

8
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,980
哦,姑娘们在水池边
Oh, the girls are by the pool.

9
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,890
哎呀,哎呀,哎呀,莉娜,你的小情郎躲哪儿去了？
Well, well, well, Lena. So where's this sexy boy toy of yours hiding?

10
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,890
我不知道你是橄榄球迷,帕特力克
I didn't know you were a football fan, Patrick.

11
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,760
我从不看比赛,我只是特别爱他的老内衣广告
I've never watched a game. I'm just a big fan of his old underwear ads.

12
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,830
他大概刚冲完澡,我这就去揪他出来
Well, he's probably just getting out of the shower. Let me go hurry his ass up.

13
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,230
- 嗨 - 嘿,宝贝
- Hi. - Hey, babe.

14
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,130
 最 长 的 一 码 

15
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,710
第四节开始,欧文斯要掷球了,他给了大空档里的布朗！
Start of the fourth quarter, and Owens will throw. He's got Brown wide open!

16
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,110
你肯定是在逗我玩
You have got to be kidding me.

17
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,340
亲爱的,让我看完这场比赛吧,我会带你去看电影的
Honey, just let me finish the game, I'll take you to the movies.

18
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,410
带我去看电影？
Take me to the movies?

19
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,950
拜托！楼下正在大聚会
Hello! There's a huge party going on downstairs.

20
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,390
还记得餐车和停车服务员吗？
Remember the catering trucks and the valet parkers?

21
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,560
哦,该死,我忘记了
Oh, shit, I forgot.

22
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,660
我来告诉你该忘记什么
I'll tell you what you should forget about.

23
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,360
橄榄球
Football.

24
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,870
因为有了它你就会什么都忘掉
Because it's forgotten all about you.

25
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,670
现在,你这醉鬼
Now, you're going to put this outfit on that I bought you,

26
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,640
快穿上我给你买的衣服到楼下去
drag your drunken ass downstairs

27
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,010
像好孩子一样陪陪我的客人
and mingle with my clients like a good boy.

28
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,070
我是谁？埃尔顿·约翰吗？我才不穿这鬼玩意呢
Who am l? Elton John? I ain't wearing that shit.

29
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,480
- 你要穿的 - 我可不是你训练的猴子,亲爱的
- Yes, you are. - I'm not your trained monkey, honey.

30
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,810
对啊,你比猴子可贵多了
No. You're much more expensive than that.

31
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,620
不过听我说
But I tell you what.

32
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,560
要是五分钟以后你还没下楼
If you're not downstairs in five minutes,

33
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,750
我就要让你滚下我的床
I'm gonna throw you out of my bed,

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,060
滚出我的家,滚出我的生活
out of my house and out of my life.

35
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,060
然后你就得自个儿买香蕉吃了
Then you're gonna have to pay for your own bananas.

36
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,530
我生气是因为你没穿我的礼物
I'm just so mad at you because you're not wearing my gift.

37
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,400
礼物？
Gift?

38
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,940
什么礼物？
What gift?

39
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:27,010
给爱人的礼物咯,我把它放在壁橱里了
It's like a l-love-you gift. I left it in the closet for you.

40
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,940
真的？
Really?

41
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,010
保罗,我太激动了
Paul, I'm so excited.

42
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,850
想不到你会给我送礼
I can't believe you did this.

43
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,890
- 你放在哪儿了？ - 在后面,右边
- Where'd you put it? - In the back, on the right.

44
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,690
保罗？保罗,你干什么？
Paul? Paul, what are you doing?

45
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,020
我看咱们都需要单独待会儿
I think we need some alone time, honey,

46
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,060
所以我打算开你那辆本特利去兜兜风
so I'm gonna go take a cruise in your Bentley.

47
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:47,530
混蛋醉鬼,你敢开我的车？
Don't you dare take my car, you drunken bastard!

48
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,730
- 你是我的人！ - 我是爱你的人
- I own you! - I love you.

49
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,920
来人啊,把这该死的门开开！帕特力克？
Somebody please open this damn door! Patrick?

50
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,460
- 莉娜？ - 帕特力克
- Lena? - Patrick.

51
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,760
你出什么事了？
What happened to you?

52
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,870
他把我锁在壁橱里就不管了
He locked me in the closet and left me to die.

53
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,370
上帝啊,他疯了！
Oh, my God, he is deranged!

54
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,900
他以为他可以捉弄我
He thinks he can mess with me.

55
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,080
911
911.

56
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,870
哦,捣乱的家伙来了
Oh, man. Here come the party poopers.

57
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:49,020
哎呀,哎呀,哎呀,假如这不是保罗·克鲁,那我就是见鬼了
Well, well, well. I'll be damned. If it isn't Paul Crewe.

58
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,920
我做错什么了？我是不是违章驾驶了？
So, what did I do wrong? Was I driving poorly?

59
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,600
没有,没有,有人报告说这车被偷了
Nope. Nope. This car was reported stolen.

60
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,240
不,不,不,其实这是我女朋友的车
No, no, no. It's actually my girlfriend's car.

61
00:04:58,910 --> 00:04:59,930
真见鬼
Shit happens.

62
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,400
是见鬼了,我是说,瞧瞧你那耳朵
Shit does happen. I mean, look what happened to your ears.

63
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,610
我得问问你,他就用那耳朵听XM Radio？ （一家卫星广播公司）
I gotta ask you something. Does he get XM Radio with those?

64
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,010
确实能听到几个频道
Actually, they get a couple of channels.

65
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,610
这是保罗·克鲁
It's Paul Crewe.

66
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,120
那么还有一个问题
Another question, though.

67
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,260
圣诞老人 他长什么样？
Santa Claus. What's he like?

68
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,450
小伙子,我不想逮捕你这样的名人
Boy, I hate to arrest a public figure like yourself,

69
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,630
不过我想,你现在
but, hell, I don't think you got too many

70
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,200
没有太多公事要办吧？对吗？
endorsement deals to worry about, now, do you?

71
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,130
听着,弗罗多先生,别小看我
Now, listen here, Mr. Frodo. Don't get short with me.

72
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,370
很棒,我是说,他很棒
That was good. I mean, he's good.

73
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,210
老兄,希望你有很多钱来玩这场游戏
Man. I hope you got a lot of money for that game you threw,

74
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,680
因为这是我见过的最惨的事了
because that was the most pathetic thing I ever saw.

75
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,010
现在下车吧,克鲁先生
Now, step out of the vehicle, Mr. Crewe.

76
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,910
你不觉得我该把车开过去一点吗？可能会被人蹭到的
Don't you think I should pull the car over more? I could get sideswiped.

77
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,090
你口齿不太清楚,保罗今晚一直在喝酒？
You're slurring your words a bit there, Paul. You been drinking tonight?

78
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:56,690
绝对没有,帮个忙好吗？拿着这个,我倒一下车
Absolutely not. Now, could you do me a favor? Hold this beer while I back it up.

79
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:06,430
嘿,你就把那罐喝完吧,我还有五罐呢 保重,哥们
Hey, you can finish that one. I got five more. Take care, guys.

80
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,260
我们正在处理3-94情况
We got a 3-94 in progress.

81
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,890
好的,冷静
Okay, remain calm.

82
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:35,160
你好吗？好吗？好吗？好吗？
How you doing? What's up? What's up? What's up?

83
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,530
现在您看到的是实况直播,警方正在追逐
What you are watching is live footage of a vehicle, apparently stolen,

84
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,230
一辆明显是被盗的车辆
being pursued by police.

85
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,340
我们现在得到消息说,这辆车的司机
We're receiving word now that the driver of that vehicle

86
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,440
是匹兹堡的前橄榄球明星保罗·克鲁
is former Pittsburgh football star Paul Crewe.

87
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,200
您可能记得
Crewe, you might remember,

88
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,940
克鲁是唯一因为在职业橄榄球赛中打假球
was the only man ever to be indicted on federal racketeering charges

89
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,590
而遭到联邦的诈骗罪起诉的人
for shaving points in a professional football game,

90
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,420
尽管此事从未被完全证实
although it was never fully proven.

91
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,990
Yeah！
Yeah!

92
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,030
- 喂 - 不准再刮伤我的车
- Hello. - Do not get one more scratch

93
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,760
要不然我就割断你的喉咙
on my car, or I will slit your throat.

94
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,040
你瞧,我们的问题就在这儿
See, that's our problem, sweetie.

95
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,840
你对这车比对我们俩还要关心
You care about this car more than you do us.

96
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,740
再说你怎么知道这宝贝已经被刮伤了？
And how'd you even know there was a scratch on this baby?

97
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:29,940
因为我就在电视上看着你,全国人民都在看
Because I am watching you on TV, as is the whole country.

98
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,910
你又一次向所有人证明
Once again, you are proving to everyone

99
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,610
你是个一文不值的垃圾
what a worthless piece of shit you are.

100
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,950
啊,但愿他们喜欢这样
Well, I hope they like this.

101
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,370
嘿,莉娜！
Hey, Lena!

102
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,140
我想可以正式分手了！
I think we should start seeing other people!

103
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,950
我想我是爱上某人了
I think I'm in love.

104
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,030
好消息,小伙子们,我没把啤酒洒出来
Good news, boys, I didn't spill my beer.

105
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,300
毫无疑问,今晚克鲁严重违反了
Without question, Crewe's five-year federal probation for point-shaving

106
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,470
五年假球缓刑期中的限制规定
has been severely violated tonight.

107
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:25,130
这位曾红极一时的橄榄球明星,看来前途非常黯淡
The future of this once-great football star looks very dark indeed.

108
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,520
这下远离大城市了吧？大明星？
Long way from the big city, huh, superstar?

109
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,490
在这里过日子吗？
Staying with the times around here, huh?

110
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,510
她是不是很美？
Ain't she beautiful?

111
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,790
到家了,孩子
Home sweet home, boy.

112
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,290
站起来
Get on your feet.

113
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,530
你是个幸运的狗杂种,克鲁
You're one lucky son of a bitch, Crewe.

114
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,760
- 是吗？ - 是的
- Is that right? - That's right.

115
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,270
典狱长很爱橄榄球
See, the warden loves his football.

116
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,540
事实上,你那次的比赛,他支持的是赢球一方
Fact, he was on the winning side of your little thing.

117
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,710
- 哦,那要恭喜他了 - 可我没有
- Well, tell him congratulations. - But I wasn't.

118
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,680
欢迎来阿伦维尔
Welcome to Allenville.

119
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,880
谢谢你,警长,从这里开始就交给我吧
Thank you, sergeant. I'll take it from here.

120
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,260
- 下午好,犯人克鲁 - 啊
- Afternoon, inmate Crewe. - Yeah.

121
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,490
来吧,典狱长要见你
Come on. Warden wants to see you.

122
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,150
咱们走
Let's do it.

123
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,660
快走
Move it.

124
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,820
我自己在大学里也打过一点球
I used to play a little college ball myself.

125
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,990
在迈阿密大学
Down at the University of Miami.

126
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,590
你肯定有很多老队友给关在这里
I bet a lot of your old teammates are locked up in here.

127
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,230
我的老队友里没有犯人,倒是有几个看守
No inmates from my playing days. Couple of guards, though.

128
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,230
瞧,我们这里有个很棒的狱警联盟
See, we got us a fine prison-guard league down here.

129
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:42,170
就像公司垒球队
It's like a company softball team.

130
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,600
现在,典狱长@@
Now, the warden@@

131
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,570
…他想叫你帮个忙
@@he's gonna ask you to help out.

132
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,370
好啊,帮什么忙？
Okay. With what?

133
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,380
那可不好
That wasn't nice.

134
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,120
典狱长问你的时候
When the warden asks you,

135
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,590
你要怎么说？
what are you gonna say?

136
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,390
行？
Yes?

137
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,940
你要对他说“不”,明白吗？
You're gonna tell him "no." You got it?

138
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,800
你要对典狱长说
You're gonna tell the warden

139
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:23,310
你不想和他的橄榄球爱好扯上关系
that you want nothing to do with his football fantasies.

140
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,310
不想在我的后院里这么干
Not in my back yard.

141
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,740
因为管这监狱的不是典狱长,是我
Because the warden don't run this prison. I do.

142
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,080
你明白了？
You understand?

143
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,990
没有全明白
Not entirely.

144
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,630
好,我明白了,坏蛋,我明白了
Okay. I feel you, dog. I feel you.

145
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,500
“破坏王”保罗·克鲁
Paul "Wrecking" Crewe.

146
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,670
虽然我不会经常对我的新客人这样说
I don't get to say this to my new guests very often,

147
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,360
不过你能来这里我真是感到荣幸
but it's an honor to have you here at this institution.

148
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,870
被关在这里我也很荣幸,先生
It's an honor to be locked up here, sir.

149
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,810
哦,对了,这是埃罗尔·丹德里奇
Oh, well, this is Errol Dandridge.

150
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,610
山德士上校一直在吃自己的鸡肉 （把他比作肯德基老头了）
Colonel Sanders been eating his own chicken.

151
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,450
他是我的政治顾问
He's my political adviser.

152
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,560
曾有几个非常有影响的人和我接触过
See, I've been approached by several very influential people

153
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,060
问我是否有兴趣当州长
wondering if I'd be interested in standing for governor.

154
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:17,790
因为他们看到了我对这座监狱的管理,觉得我也许能管理整个州
They see the way I run this prison, think maybe I should run this state.

155
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,630
只不过是鸡奸案少一点,对吗？
Only with less sodomy, right?

156
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,530
我希望是没有
Hopefully none.

157
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,310
对不起
Sorry.

158
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,970
在德克萨斯州我们对两样东西特别重视
Now, there are two things we take very seriously here in the state of Texas.

159
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,280
监狱和橄榄球
Prison and football.

160
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,380
在这里我们也打一点橄榄球
We play a little of the latter here.

161
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:44,920
典狱长太谦虚了,不肯承认他的球队非常好
The warden is too modest to admit that his team is rather good.

162
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,720
但是好得不够
But not good enough.

163
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:50,290
上次夺冠是在五年前
Five years since our last championship.

164
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,030
五年了
Five years.

165
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,290
我千方百计通路子
Now, I've worked real hard, pulled strings,

166
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,870
托了很多人情才把你搞到这里来,保罗
called in quite a few favors to get you here, Paul.

167
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,970
那么,你愿意干吗？
Now, why would you go and do that?

168
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,610
因为我相信你能让我们重回正轨
Because I am convinced that you can get us back on track.

169
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:11,340
我自己都不记得有多久没打橄榄球了,我真的不想干
I haven't played football in I don't know how long. I don't really want to.

170
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,920
你不用打比赛,保罗,只要当顾问就行
You wouldn't be playing, Paul. Just consulting.

171
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,710
当选过国家橄榄球联盟MVP的人
Anyone who was once the MVP of the National Football League

172
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,520
肯定能提供很多专家意见
must have a great deal of expertise to offer.

173
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:24,480
队长,假如让克鲁先生用他的经验来教导我们
Captain, what would you say to Mr. Crewe looking in,

174
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,160
你有什么意见？
giving us the benefit of his experience?

175
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,630
我觉得这是很好的主意,典狱长 可以利用我们能够获得的一切帮助
I think that's a real good idea, warden. We can use all the help we can get.

176
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,670
好,那么就全妥了
Well, then, it's all settled.

177
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,230
你怎么说,保罗？
What you say, Paul?

178
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,540
我很感谢你的邀请 但是我想放弃
I appreciate the offer, but I'm gonna have to pass.

179
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,470
我可以向你保证
Now, I can assure you

180
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:51,780
只要你参加,你在这里的日子就会轻松得多
that your time here will be a whole lot easier if you just participate.

181
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,390
我只想自己过完日子然后回家,没别的了
I just wanna do my time and go home. Nothing else.

182
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,130
请你见谅,克鲁先生
If you'll excuse us, Mr. Crewe.

183
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,800
科纳瓦队长,你留一下
Captain Knauer, you can stay.

184
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,670
坐下！
Sit down!

185
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,240
我以前很喜欢你做的内衣广告
I used to love your underwear commercials.

186
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,510
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

187
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,920
我前夫穿的紧身衣就是那种牌子
My ex-husband wore the same brand of tighty whities.

188
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:30,090
不过不像你能把衣服撑得那么满
He didn't fill them out quite as well as you, though.

189
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:34,090
特效,好莱坞的把戏,不全是因为我
Special effects. Hollywood. Not all me.

190
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,430
哦,我非常怀疑
Oh, I doubt that very seriously.

191
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,600
好,那就让他变得热心,妈的！
Well, then get him enthusiastic, damn it!

192
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,700
来吧,起来.
Come on, get up.

193
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,930
怎么样？现在全搞定了？
How'd it go in there? We all set now?

194
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,010
对啊,我们配合得真好
Oh, yeah, we're real tight.

195
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,880
只给你最好的,大明星
Only the finest for you, superstar.

196
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,290
开玩笑而已
I was just playing.

197
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,670
我不会忘记你的,克鲁
I ain't gonna forget you, Crewe.

198
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,970
嘿,你那场比赛害我输了钱,混蛋！
Hey, yo, you owe me money on that game, punk!

199
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,840
你最好当心点,橄榄球先生！
Better watch yourself, Mr. Football!

200
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,240
婊子！
Bitch!

201
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,820
对,你最好逃,娘们
Yeah, you better run, woman.

202
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,220
喂,橄榄球
Yo, football.

203
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,360
坐吧
Take a seat.

204
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,420
谢谢
Thanks.

205
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,460
知道吗,我还从没见过哪个犯人
You know, I have never seen one inmate just walk in here

206
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,760
一进来就让所有人都恨的
and be unanimously hated by the entire population.

207
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,300
- 从来没见过 - 我怎么会这么走运？
- I ain't never seen it. - How'd I get so lucky?

208
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,370
你可以抢银行、贩毒
You could have robbed banks, sold crack,

209
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:53,100
偷你奶奶的养老金,没人会在乎
stole your grandmama's pension, and nobody would have cared.

210
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:56,800
可是在橄榄球赛里打假球？老兄,那可不是美国人干的事
But shaving points off a football game? Man, that's just un-American.

211
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,210
- 你打橄榄球？ - 我？不
- You play football? - Me? No.

212
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,440
我太没用,他们以前先挑白人,孩子再挑我
I suck so bad, they used to pick me after the white kids.

213
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:06,380
他们还曾经被我搞到发疯,心想： “真不敢相信,我挑了个不会打球的黑鬼”
Used to be mad too. It's like, "l can't believe I picked a nigga that can't play."

214
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,580
- 我叫凯尔泰克 - 保罗·克鲁
- Caretaker. - Paul Crewe.

215
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,260
你想要什么我都能帮忙
Whatever your pleasure, I can facilitate.

216
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,590
你想要大麻,想要冰毒-- 或者想要百忧解,找我就对了
You need weed, you need meth-- Hey, you need Prozac, I'm your man.

217
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,030
我知道你们白人总是得忧郁症
I know how you white boys always deal with that depression.

218
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,500
我是说,从我个人角度来看
I mean, me personally, I don't understand what you white boys

219
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,730
我不明白你们白人都在忧郁个啥 嘿,你是白人啊,笑一笑
all depressed about. Hey, you're white. Smile.

220
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,210
稍微付点报酬,我连麦当劳快餐都能帮你搞到
And for a small fee, I can even get you McDonald's.

221
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,040
- 真的？ - 对,Mickey D的
- Really? - Yeah, that's right. Mickey D's.

222
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,970
我兄弟汉堡包埃迪有门路
My man Cheeseburger Eddy got the hookup.

223
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,150
汉堡包埃迪？
Cheeseburger Eddy?

224
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,180
没错,可以给你吃麦旋风
That's right. We can get our McFlurry on.

225
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,080
吃吧,胖子
Enjoy it, fat man.

226
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,410
能搞到漂亮女人的爱情吗？
What about the love of a beautiful woman?

227
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,110
哦,那你得降低一下
Well, you're gonna have to lower your standards

228
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,290
关于漂亮的标准和关于女人的标准
on the beautiful part and on the woman part.

229
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,360
嘿
Hey.

230
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,560
咱们还是只谈汉堡包吧
Let's just stick with the cheeseburgers.

231
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,960
啊,他们现在是挺丑,但是过了八个月 你就会觉得他像碧昂斯（当红女歌星）
Oh, they ugly now, but in eight months, he gonna look like Beyoncé.

232
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,130
不,谢了
No, thanks.

233
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,270
那,现在是最重要的问题
Now, here's the most important part.

234
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,830
你不能让这些家伙吓住,不能让他们瞧不起你
You can't let these guys scare you. You can't let them punk you.

235
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,770
因为要是你那样做了,你最后就会变成别人的婊子
Because if you do that, you gonna end up being somebody's bitch.

236
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,770
那我可不要,谢谢你的忠告
Don't want that. Thanks for the advice.

237
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,310
嘿,我帮你把盘子拿走吧
Hey. Let me take that tray out for you.

238
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,080
我还没吃完呢
I ain't done eating yet.

239
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,080
哦,没吃完？那我还给你
Oh, you're not? I'll give it back to you, then.

240
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,780
你死定了！
You're dead!

241
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,630
马蜂窝！
Hornet's Nest!

242
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,610
全都趴着别动
Everybody stay down.

243
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,180
不许出声！
Stay quiet!

244
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,580
来吧,克鲁,起来
Come on, Crewe, get up.

245
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,560
起来,大明星
Get up, superstar.

246
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,560
是,长官
Yes, sir.

247
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,890
你以为在这儿想干什么就能干什么,是吗？
You think you can do anything you want around here, don't you?

248
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,660
哈,你跟管这地方叫“家”的其他垃圾
Well, you are no different than any other piece of shit

249
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,590
没什么两样
that calls this place home.

250
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,730
真的？这些家伙也觉得你是个乡巴佬？
Really? These guys think you're a dumb redneck too?

251
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,940
小妞,那是你的新绰号
Girl, that's your new boo.

252
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,240
最好收回你那一套,已经不新鲜了
You better cut that shit out. It's getting old.

253
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,780
这下你死定了
That's gonna cost you.

254
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,450
我盼着呢
Looking forward to it.

255
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,470
醒一醒,睡美人
Wake up, Sleeping Beauty.

256
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,310
嘿,鸟人
Hey, superdick.

257
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,410
典狱长想知道你在蒸笼里呆过以后是不是改了主意
Warden's wondering if your stay in the hotbox has changed your mind.

258
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,580
我在这里多久了？
How long have I been in here?

259
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,260
一个星期 想呆两星期吗？
One week. Wanna go for two?

260
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,020
话说回来,你是怎么找到这些家伙的？
How'd you find these guys anyways?

261
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,360
招募的,孩子
Recruitment, boy.

262
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,900
大学里的明星要是没进职业队,总得有个地方去
When college stars don't get drafted, they need a place to go.

263
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,160
有工作,有钱,有社会保险
A job, money, security.

264
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,070
谁他妈把佳得乐都喝了？
Who drank all the damn Gatorade?!

265
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,040
该死的！
Damn it!

266
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,840
显然还有类固醇
And apparently steroids.

267
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,780
你看,你好像已经得到了 你想要的所有人才 为什么还需要我？
Look, seems like you got all the talent you'd want. So why do you need me?

268
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,850
啊,你可能觉得难以置信
Well, now, you might find this hard to believe,

269
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,890
监狱联盟里有些人对我不太喜欢
but there's folks here in the prison league don't care for me very much.

270
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:10,180
- 你？典狱长？ - 他们觉得在第一场比赛
- You, warden? - They thought it might be amusing

271
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:13,020
就安排我们和联盟冠军打,会很有意思
to schedule the defending league champs as our first game.

272
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,890
而我呢？我觉得你这样的职业老手
And me? Well, I thought an old pro like yourself

273
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,970
也许能提供一些训练的诀窍、高招、秘方
might have some training-camp tricks, drills, insights to offer up.

274
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,860
让我们有竞争优势
Give us the competitive edge.

275
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,130
好的,这比较简单,你需要一场热身赛
All right. Relatively simple. You need a tune-up game.

276
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,310
热身赛？
A tune-up game?

277
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:30,140
对 在大学里,我们每个赛季开始时 都会跟阿巴拉契亚的队
Yeah. In college, we'd start every season against Appalachian State

278
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,940
或是什么很烂的二线队打
or some slack Division ll team.

279
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:35,380
把他们打得屁滚尿流,鼓舞一下队员的自信心
Kick the living shit out of them. Get their confidence up.

280
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,510
你知道吗,保罗？
You know something, Paul?

281
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,050
- 你刚给了我一个灵感 - 太好了 是什么？
- You've just given me an inspiration. - That's great. What?

282
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,220
你要组一支队来和我们打第一场比赛
You're gonna assemble a team to play the first game against us.

283
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:47,760
而你,克鲁先生,将是四分卫
And you, Mr. Crewe, are gonna be the quarterback.

284
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,250
我不同意
I don't think so.

285
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,790
听我说
Let me tell you something.

286
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,990
在我的监狱里,要想过下去,你就得照办
In my prison, to get along, you gotta go along.

287
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,360
我只想蹲满三年然后走人
I just wanna do my three years and be done.

288
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:59,330
在袭击科纳瓦队长之前,你的刑期是三年
Three years is before you assaulted Captain Knauer.

289
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,770
现在,你可能要陪我们很长一段日子了,克鲁先生
Now, you could be with us for a very long time, Mr. Crewe.

290
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,400
好吧,我干
Fine, I'll do it.

291
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,510
正确选择
Good choice.

292
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,010
不过有一个条件
But one condition, though.

293
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,950
你要答应不让科纳瓦队长暗算我
Gotta promise me to keep Captain Knauer off my back.

294
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,120
那就说定了
It's a deal.

295
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,920
那么,你有四个星期来组一支队并训练他们
Now, you got four weeks to assemble a team and train them.

296
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:23,320
什么,我们是不是每天只能用软球练半小时？
What, are we gonna have a half-hour a day to practice with a Nerf ball?

297
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:27,130
哦,在这些大墙以内,我保证让我的人给你充分的自由
Oh, I'll make sure my boys allow you sufficient freedom, within these walls,

298
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,130
来使你的球队成型
to get your team in shape.

299
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,600
这是什么？“橄榄球先拔？”
What's this? "Football 'tree-outs."'

300
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,140
什么叫“先拔”？
What the hell is a "tree-out"?

301
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,180
“选拔”,你个笨猪
"Tryout," you half a meatball.

302
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,370
- 这橄榄球是怎么回事,哥们？ - 克鲁正在组一支球队
- What's this football thing about, man? - Crewe's getting a team together.

303
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,110
- 跟谁打？ - 看守
- To play against who? - The guards.

304
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,980
我不知道你们都是怎么想的,不过我有时会有冲动
Now, I don't know about y'all, but I occasionally have the impulse

305
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,990
想要揍一揍我们的某位优秀管教人员
to physically assault one of our finer correctional officers.

306
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,390
哦？那到底怎么才能做到？
Yeah? Well, how the hell we gonna get to do that?

307
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,500
在“先拔”上亮一手就行了,你个大呆瓜
Just show up at the "tree-outs," you big, dumb bitch.

308
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,330
女孩子也能打球吗？
Do the girls get to play?

309
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:04,370
我们打的是橄榄球,不是卵球
We're playing footballs, not balls-balls.

310
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,870
这是放屁 只不过又给看守一个机会来打我们
This is bullshit. Just another chance for the guards to beat on us.

311
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:11,100
你们这些白痴还不明白？我们可以放开手脚打那些看守
Don't you idiots get it? We could get a free shot at the guards.

312
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,740
这下轮到我们出手了,我们可以把他们胖揍一顿
This is our turn. We could beat up on them.

313
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,500
我们可以宰了他们
We could kill them.

314
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,920
宰了他们
Kill them.

315
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,820
你们都知道,MVP把自己的队友出卖了
You know MVP sold his own teammates out.

316
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,150
你们觉得他会对你们这些傻瓜干什么？
What do you think he's gonna do to you fools?

317
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,960
这才是真理,上面还有些奶酪呢
And that's the truth. With some cheese on it.

318
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,700
这两片屁股中间可没肉饼
There ain't no meat loaf between these buns.

319
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,230
喂,那是我的布告,老兄！费了好大劲做的！
Yo, man, that's my flier, man! I worked hard on it!

320
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,570
看见了？他像个小婊子一样跑了 对吧？你看见了,对吧？
You see? He ran like a little bitch, right? You saw that, right?

321
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,400
哦,球队需要你 球队需要你
Yo, team needs you. Team needs you.

322
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:49,480
你-- 你来参加--参加先拔吧
You sh-- You come to the tr-- Come to the tree-outs.

323
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,420
蹩脚场地,垃圾器材@@
Crappy field, shit-ass equipment@@

324
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,650
嘿,老兄,至少那边有几个世界级选手
Hey, man, at least we got some world-class players over there.

325
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,790
四十五
Forty-five.

326
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,620
四十六
Forty-six.

327
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,260
四十七
Forty-seven.

328
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,660
他说不定能撑起这支球队
He might make the team.

329
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:14,230
好啊,假如要把他刷下来,就由你去说
Well, if we gotta cut him, you're doing it.

330
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,130
四十九
Forty-nine.

331
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,600
五十
Fifty.

332
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,040
- 好,老兄 - 干得好
- All right, man. - Good job, man.

333
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,710
好,好,好,你是橄榄球运动员？
Well, well, well. You a football player?

334
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:25,900
啊,不 从没打过橄榄球,先生
Oh, no. I never played no football, mister.

335
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,280
那么,是怎么回事？你看了布告,觉得这比较好玩？
So, what happened? You read the flier, thought it looked like some fun?

336
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,180
- 哦,我不识字 - 哦,没关系
- Oh, I can't read. - Oh, don't worry.

337
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,580
读书是有钱人的事
Reading's for rich people.

338
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:37,150
那么你知道,我们正在组织橄榄球队,欢迎你加入
So you know, we're putting together a football team. Love you to join.

339
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,490
你会教我打橄榄球？
Will you teach me to football?

340
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,930
我们当然会教你打,对吧,凯尔泰克？
Sure we'll teach you to football. Won't we, Caretaker?

341
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,330
嘿,我什么都会教你,只要别吃了我就行
Hey, I'll teach you anything. Just don't eat me.

342
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,470
好啊
Okay.

343
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,300
放下,史瑞克,放下！ （把他比作怪物史瑞克了）
Down, Shrek. Down!

344
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:56,710
好,来吧 想参加球队选拔的都起来
Okay, bring it in. Whoever's trying out for the team, wake up.

345
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,400
拿出点精神给哥们儿看看好不好？
Can you give a brother a little hustle?

346
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,300
很好
Very good.

347
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,110
可能有人还不知道我是谁,我是保罗·克鲁
For those of you who don't know who I am, I'm Paul Crewe.

348
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,280
我将是你们的教练,你们的队长,你们的四分卫
I'm gonna be your coach, your captain, your quarterback.

349
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,480
你有几年没打球了,为什么不能让我打四分卫？
You haven't played in years. Why can't I be quarterback?

350
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,680
- 说得对 咱们看看你的本事 - 好啊
- You're right. Let's see what you got. - All right.

351
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,020
- 扔过来,我接着 - 传,传！传！
- Hit me, I'm open. - Hike, hike! Hike!

352
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,360
这就是为什么,现在坐下,闭上你的嘴
That's why. Now, sit down and shut up.

353
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,460
是滑了一下,我刚才吃爆米花来着
It slipped. I just ate popcorn.

354
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:21,900
提问：先生们,有谁以前打过橄榄球？
Question: Any of you gentlemen ever play football before?

355
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:24,700
- 你打过？在哪儿？ - 堪萨斯州队
- You did? Where? - Kansas State.

356
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:27,100
你耍我吧？在施奈德教练手下？
Are you shitting me? For Coach Snyder?

357
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,940
堪萨斯州立监狱队
Kansas State Prison.

358
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,270
我听说那儿的床垫最软了
Now, I hear they have the softest mattresses out there.

359
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,810
没错,是这样
Yeah, they do.

360
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,210
不如西德克萨斯精神病院的软
Not as soft as the ones at West Texas Mental lnstitution.

361
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,050
- 真的？ - 有话咱们以后再说吧
- Really? - Let's finish this conversation later.

362
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,350
现在,我要看看你们的水平
For now, I wanna see what you got out there.

363
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,750
从一到十给他们打分
We'll grade them on a scale of one to ten.

364
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,120
快啊！加油,加油,加油！
Move it! Hustle, hustle, hustle!

365
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:51,360
给这些人六分,给这些人五分
Give these guys sixes. Give these guys fives.

366
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:54,000
好,好,给他们三分
Good. Good. Give them threes.

367
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,530
非常好！
Very nice!

368
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,830
- 是不是漏了谁？ - 堪萨斯州队的那家伙呢？
- Aren't we missing somebody? - Where's the Kansas State guy?

369
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,840
你们这些混蛋最好别把我刷下来！我还在这队里呢！
You assholes better not cut me! I'm still on this team!

370
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,100
负二
Negative two.

371
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,340
好的,就给他负二
All right, go with negative two.

372
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,750
嘿！来人,给我一瓶节食可乐！
Hey! Somebody bring me a Diet Coke!

373
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,010
- 来吧！ - 好的！
- Let's do this! - That's it!

374
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,150
五分
Five.

375
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,630
好 七分
Good. Seven.

376
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,660
笨蛋轮胎！你这破烂胎！
Stupid tire! You're a fricking tire!

377
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:27,100
你以为你比我强？我要揍扁你！
You think you're better than me?! I'll kick your ass!

378
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,500
三分
Three.

379
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:32,600
再加半分？
And a half?

380
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,170
行,那比较好
Yeah. That's better.

381
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,840
好的,很好
Okay. Good.

382
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:40,170
对,撞那沙袋,你上,老兄
Yeah. Hit that bag, man. There you go, man.

383
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,350
四分
Four.

384
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,510
- 五分 我不知道 - 我上
- Five. I don't know. - I go.

385
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,380
上吧,斯韦托斯基！
Come on, Switowski!

386
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:51,550
爸爸！
Daddy!

387
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,220
哦,厉害！
Oh, man!

388
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,430
- 瞧瞧 - 他把沙袋从链子上扯下来了
- Look at that. - He got it off the hinge.

389
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:59,220
- 我看该打十分 - 那就打十分吧
- I think that's a ten. - Let's go with a ten.

390
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:02,800
对不起 我“打破破”了你的玩具
I'm sorry. I "brokeded" your toy.

391
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,130
没关系,那很好,你该和凯尔泰克拥抱一下
No, that's a good thing. You should have a victory hug with Caretaker.

392
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,100
什么？你说什么？嘿！
What? What you talking about, man? Hey!

393
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,540
混蛋！
Asshole!

394
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,140
好,伙计们,这很简单,你们做一次钮扣钩
Okay, fellas, it's pretty simple. You do a buttonhook.

395
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,840
你们其余的人替我阻挡,剩下的我来解决
The rest of you guys block for me. I'll take care of the rest.

396
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:22,140
好吗？上,上
Okay? On "go." On "go."

397
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,290
预备？开始！
Ready? Break!

398
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:28,590
我们慢慢来吧
We'll work on that.

399
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:33,090
好,用一般速度,慢一点,别着急
Okay, half speed on this one, guys. Slow and easy.

400
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,270
预备？
Ready?!

401
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,060
开始！
Go!

402
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,340
停下！
Stop it!

403
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,040
停止暴力行为！
Stop the violence!

404
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,740
我们不能和平相处吗？
Can't we all get along?

405
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,190
- 嘿,保罗 - 昂格尔
- Hey, Paul. - Unger.

406
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,520
- 球队看起来很棒 - 哦,是啊
- Team's looking great. - Oh, yeah.

407
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,460
- 你也是 - 对,正在努力
- So are you. - Yep. Working on it.

408
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:15,800
看守们会像古代巴比伦那样血流成河
The blood of the guards is gonna flow like the rivers of ancient Babylon.

409
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:19,460
那是好消息,昂格尔,你真好
That's good news. Unger, you're the man.

410
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:24,470
今天干得很好 你们开始像个样子了
Good job today. You're all starting to look really sharp out there. Yeah.

411
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,980
明天见
See you tomorrow.

412
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,620
- 我们会很惨 - 是啊,毫无疑问
- We're gonna suck. - Yeah. No doubt about it.

413
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,830
看来你们需要一点帮助
You look like you could use a little help.

414
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:50,340
不是我笑话你,老兄,你看来有点年头了
No offense, my man, but you're a little seasoned.

415
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,530
有点年头？
Seasoned?

416
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:55,070
我不是想打球 我想做教练,我是内特·斯卡波罗
I'm not asking to play. I'll coach. I'm Nate Scarborough.

417
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,240
内特·斯卡波罗？
Nate Scarborough?

418
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,350
是俄克拉荷马的海斯曼奖杯获得者？
The Heisman Trophy winner from Oklahoma?

419
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:04,480
是D区牢房的囚犯
The inmate from cellblock D.

420
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:08,150
不过,大概在一百年前我还能跑能打的时候
But about a hundred years ago, when I could run and gun,

421
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:11,120
我确实是俄克拉荷马州人
yeah, I was a Sooner then.

422
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,950
我听说你已经死了
I heard you were dead.

423
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:17,260
不,我没死,我一直在这里发臭
No, I ain't dead. I've been right here, rotting.

424
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:21,130
等待一个机会,回敬那些虐待狂看守
Waiting for a chance to get back at those sadistic guards.

425
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:24,240
等着,这个机会
Waiting. For this.

426
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,600
那么,教练,你也看到了
Well, coach, as you can see,

427
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:28,570
这里的精英其实没有和我们合作
we don't exactly have the cream of the crop to work with here.

428
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,010
那我们该怎么办？怎么才能找到球员？
Well, what are we gonna do? How are we gonna find players?

429
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,410
他们怎么让你进佛罗里达州队的？
How'd they get you to go to Florida State?

430
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,170
他们把我招进去的
They recruited me.

431
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,780
我去找人来
I'll get the strippers.

432
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,250
哦,林赛,这不是关于赞颂或祝贺的问题
Well, now, Lindsay, this isn't about credit or congratulations.

433
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,220
这是关于给失足者一个机会
This is about giving men who've made mistakes in their lives

434
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,760
让他们改过自新
an opportunity to rise above themselves.

435
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:53,730
走出铁窗的问题
To move beyond the bars of containment.

436
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,220
说什么？
Say what?

437
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,330
我要对你做什么
What I would do to you.

438
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,220
好,踢得好,小子
Yeah. Nice boot, skin man.

439
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,650
嘿,为什么让他踢球？我可是国家级选手
Hey, why does he get to be the kicker? I was All-State, man.

440
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,620
咱们看看你的本事
Let's see what you got.

441
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,490
这就是为什么,蠢驴
That's why, you dumb-ass.

442
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,490
还是去跑圈吧
Just go do some laps.

443
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,450
我听说你们找我有事
I heard you boys needed to see me.

444
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,430
对,我介绍你认识斯基奇
Yeah. I want you to meet Skitchy.

445
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,230
嘿,老兄,到那幢房子里去看看吧
Hey, dog. Check that building over there.

446
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,770
他们把所有记录都放在地下室里
They keep all the records in the basement.

447
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:32,270
他在这里呆得太久了,知道每样东西在哪里
He's been here so long, he knows where everything is.

448
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,500
这可不一定是好事啊,对吗？
That ain't necessarily a good thing, is it?

449
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:38,510
我的假释期在86年,但是我跟看守打了一架,所以@@
I had a parole date in '86. But I got in a tussle with a guard and@@

450
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,110
就一拳,假释就没了
One punch and it went away.

451
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,910
为了一拳就多关二十年？
Twenty extra years for one punch?

452
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,140
他很倒霉,他打的那个看守
Well, unfortunately for him, the guard he punched

453
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,220
如今恰好成了典狱长
just happens to be the warden now.

454
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,180
哦,该死 海岑典狱长？
Oh, shit. Warden Hazen?

455
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,510
“哦,该死”,说得对
"Oh, shit" is right.

456
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:54,060
院子里有人打架,快派人支援
Fight in the yard. Send backup.

457
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,090
来得正好
Right on time.

458
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,350
- 咱们干吧 - 咱们干吧
- Let's do it. - Let's do it.

459
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,730
有个黑人做朋友,你们很高兴吧？
Ain't you guys glad you got a black man for a friend?

460
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,530
- 是啊 - 走吧
- Hell, yeah. - Come on.

461
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,440
海岑给每个犯人都评了级
Hazen has a rating system for every con.

462
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:18,950
三星是什么意思？
What's three stars?

463
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:23,990
犯人的暴力倾向越重,星数就越多
The more prone to violence that the inmate is, the more stars he gets.

464
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,590
最高是五星
Five stars is the max.

465
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:29,320
我还不知道有这事,瞧瞧我这个疯子得了几颗星
I didn't know that. Let's see how many stars my maniacal ass got.

466
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,400
半颗星？这肯定是搞错了,再看看,再看看
Half a star? That's gotta be a mistake. Check it again. Check it again.

467
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,570
你大概就和一箱子小猫咪一样疯
You're about as maniacal as a boxful of kittens.

468
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:39,930
什么话？这可不好笑
Come on, that's not funny, man.

469
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,660
我该去捅个人,让我的级别涨上去
I'm gonna have to stab somebody or something. Get my rep up.

470
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,140
那我们今晚就来个疯狂枕头战吧,那可以让你的级别涨一点
Why don't we have a maniacal pillow fight tonight. That could get it up some.

471
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,880
对,我们还可以卖门票
Yeah. We can sell it to pay-per-view.

472
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,050
超级明星对战半颗星
Superstar Versus Half-a-Star.

473
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:55,710
你给我闭嘴,要不我就割了你的喉咙,看里面的灰尘飘出来
Why don't you shut up before I slit your throat and watch the dust come out.

474
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,650
好啦,哥们,我们只有几分钟时间
Come on, guys, we only got a couple minutes.

475
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,360
这家伙怎样？
How about this guy?

476
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,360
操,这傻瓜上了三次电椅,还没死
Damn, this fool got the chair three times, ain't died yet.

477
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,390
嗯,我们也许得不到最有才华的球队
Well, we may not have the most talented team,

478
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,030
但是肯定有最残忍的球队
but we will definitely have the meanest.

479
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:45,600
- 他为什么这么干？ - 因为他是个变态
- What's he doing that for? - Because he's a freak.

480
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,030
嘿,大脚怪兽！有人来看你了！
Hey, Sasquatch! Someone's here to see you!

481
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,370
你这样可不太聪明
Not too smart on your part.

482
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,470
嘿
Hey.

483
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,340
撞脑袋好玩吗？
How's the headbanging coming?

484
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:03,880
你出血了,你自己也知道
You're bleeding. Just so you know.

485
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,790
有人说你和我长得很像
People have told me that you and I look a lot alike,

486
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:11,220
所以我想自己来瞧瞧
so I wanted to see for myself.

487
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,990
我要去撒泡尿
I'm gonna take a piss.

488
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:18,630
你把他吓跑了,笨蛋
You scared him away, dumbshit.

489
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:27,270
开玩笑吧？五星的托雷斯喜欢看“The View”节目？
You're kidding. Five-star Torres likes The View?

490
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,770
不,他只是喜欢乔伊·贝哈
No, just Joy Behar.

491
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,840
好消息是她可以站着喂奶,就这样
The good news is she can breast-feed standing up. That's it.

492
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:36,180
她怎么会想到这种屁话的？
Where does she come up with this shit?

493
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,680
我自己也是斯妲·琼斯的粉丝,我喜欢那婊子
I'm a Star Jones man myself. I love that big bitch.

494
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,850
那好像是遥不可及的事
That was, like, the furthest thing.

495
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,650
我结婚的时候太年轻了,所以,我是说
I got married so young, so, I mean,

496
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,120
他们没有压迫我,社会没有压迫我@@
they weren't pressuring me, the society was pressuring me@@

497
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,820
托雷斯先生
Mr. T orres.

498
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:51,520
我们犯人正在组织一支橄榄球队
Us convicts are starting up a football team.

499
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:53,100
没兴趣
Not interested.

500
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:54,930
我们和看守比赛
We're playing the guards.

501
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,170
走开
Walk away.

502
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,440
好主意
Good idea.

503
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,310
两个人都不成
0 for 2.

504
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,680
你现在就在压迫她
You're putting the pressure on her right now.

505
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,280
演出结束了,朋友
Show's over, amigo.

506
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,810
我还有15分钟可以看乔伊·贝哈
I still got 15 minutes of Joy Behar.

507
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:14,510
我把你的时间扣了,回牢房去,混蛋
Well, I'm cutting you short. Back to your cell, asswipe.

508
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,150
嘿,白人小子
Hey, white boy.

509
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:20,720
切里海德要打球吗？
Cherryhead gonna play?

510
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,920
对,他会打的
Yes, he is.

511
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,830
克鲁,别忘了我会得到空档的
Crewe, don't forget, I'm gonna be open.

512
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,800
绿队40！一！
Green 40! Hut!

513
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,480
该死！
Damn!

514
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:44,780
布鲁西,布鲁西 你还好吧？你还有气吗？
Brucie. Brucie. You all right? You breathing?

515
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:48,290
我有一只鸟,他叫罗尼
I got a bird. His name is Ronnie.

516
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:51,390
哦,告诉罗尼,你被干翻了
Well, tell Ronnie you got knocked the fuck out.

517
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:58,590
哇,别开玩笑 真要打橄榄球？和看守对战？
Wow, no bullshit. Real football? Against the guards?

518
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,960
真刀真枪
Full contact.

519
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,890
科纳瓦队长是他们的四分卫？
Captain Knauer is their quarterback?

520
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:06,300
- 对？ - 那我可以擒抱他了？
- Yep. - So I get to tackle him?

521
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:09,300
对,你可以擒抱他,也可以拿锤子砸他脑袋
Yeah. You can either tackle him or hit him over the head with that hammer.

522
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,230
我只想弄伤他,不想宰了他
I wanna hurt him. Not kill him.

523
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,640
咱们还是快出去吧,免得那东西咬人
Let's get out of here before that thing bites somebody.

524
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:19,050
好,那就在练习场上见你和你的小鬣蜥吧
All right. We'll see you and your pet iguana at practice.

525
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:22,040
蹲下,预备！
Down, set!

526
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,620
一！二！
一！二！

嘿！
Hey!

00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,290
- 给我 - 解决掉那家伙
- Hit me. - Get rid of it.

529
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,830
解决掉那家伙！
Get rid of it!

530
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:39,970
他没有解决掉那家伙
He didn't get rid of it.

531
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:43,340
抱倒你这混蛋了
Sacked your ass.

532
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,810
应该有人跑到空档
Somebody's gotta get open, guys.

533
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:48,480
你被大锤砸翻了
You got hammered by the hammer.

534
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,710
我是绊倒了,我们得找些有速度的人
I think I felt it on my leg. We gotta get some speed, man.

535
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,820
你指望什么？在这里没人帮得了你
What'd you expect? You got no brothers out there.

536
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,780
你说什么？我们还有斯韦托斯基呢
What are you talking about? We got Switowski.

537
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,920
斯韦托斯基？那算一个
Switowski? That's one brother.

538
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,020
只有一个黑鬼,这可不行
That's a lonely nigga. This ain't hockey.

539
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:03,790
要找有速度的人,你知道该上哪儿
You want some speed, you know where to go.

540
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:14,930
嘿,瞧瞧这冒牌的痞子阿姆
Hey, yo, check out this fake Slim Shady, man.

541
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,600
我知道你不能拒绝我的东西
I knew you couldn't resist my shit.

542
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:21,000
我有混合饮料,美得让你灵魂出窍
I got the shakes that'll make you quake.

543
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:24,010
我有炸薯条,美得让你喜上眉梢
I got the fries that'll cross your eyes.

544
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,210
我有汉堡包,美得让你--
I got the burgers that'll--

545
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,050

546
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,310
很好,谢谢你
I'm all right. Thank you.

547
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,680
我只是想跟你们说说加入橄榄球队的事
Just wanted to talk to you fellas about possibly joining the football team.

548
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:38,050
我们只会跟你玩一种游戏,那就是
The only game we'd play with you is

549
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:43,200
狠抽打假球的白人小子让他哭得像个宝贝臭婊
Slap the Point-Shaving White Boy Till He Cries Like a Baby-Back Bitch.

550
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:47,490
宝贝臭婊,宝贝臭婊,宝贝臭婊
Baby-back bitch, baby-back bitch Baby-back bitch

551
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,870
- 真是个大傻机器人 - 啊
- That's a big-ass robot. - Yeah.

552
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,770
你帮我个忙,出去一下好吗？
You gonna help me out here?

553
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,150
谢谢,半颗星
Thank you, Half-a-Star.

554
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,050
你们也知道,我们要和看守比赛
Just so you know, we are playing the guards.

555
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:06,020
那不是球队,只不过是一帮呆瓜
That ain't a team. That's just a bunch of dumb rednecks

556
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,710
找了借口互相乱打而已
giving themselves excuses to grab each other.

557
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:12,020
这位先生肯定是正宗运动员喽？
This guy must be quite the athlete, huh?

558
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,200
你胆敢闯进这块地盘来是因为你认识我
You risk bringing your ass in the jungle because you know I am.

559
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,560
对,所以你会在一对一的比赛里打败我,是吗？
Yeah, so you'd beat me in a game of one-on-one, right?

560
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:22,860
- 什么？ - 我看你该走了
- What? - I think it's time for you to get stepping.

561
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:25,200
这样好吗？就比一场
How's this, though? One game.

562
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:29,570
我赢了你,你的人就替球队打球 你赢了我,我就再也不来烦你
I beat you, you guys play for the team. You beat me, I'll leave you alone.

563

- 球,哥们 - 球来了！
- Ball, dog. - Ball up!

566
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,190
克鲁会打篮球吗？
Can Crewe play ball?

567

他是天生的运动员
He's a natural athlete.

格雷格·路加尼斯也是,不过我打赌他会完胜的
So is Greg Louganis, but I bet you he'd get his ass whupped out here.

Did I get you?

没有,不算什么
No, that was clean.

What happened there? I think it's my ball, right?

577
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:16,660
好吧
All right.

Hell, no, baby. That was clean. Good D.

00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,240
我以为他不想受伤呢
I thought he didn't wanna get hurt.

586
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:42,970
那不是受伤的问题,是自尊心
It ain't about getting hurt. It's about pride.

587
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,080
他现在肯定觉得很自豪
I bet you he's pretty proud right now.

他们想要电视转播这场橄榄球赛
They want to televise the football game.

645
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,090
看守、囚犯、保罗·克鲁,这些都是吸引眼球的题材
Guards, cons, Paul Crewe, it's compelling stuff.

646
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:08,430
人们兴趣浓厚啊
Lots of human interest.

647
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,400
别在这里做这个
Don't do that in here.

648
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:13,010
电视
Television.

649
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,310
丹德里奇,你看这能不能帮我
Dandridge, do you think that might help my visibility

650
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,540
提高在本州选民中的知名度？
with the registered voters of this fine state?

651
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,280
哦,会的
Oh, yes.

652
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,700
怪物回来了！
The freak is back!

653
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:53,440
嘿,嘿 我又来了
Hey, hey. It's me again.

654
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:58,850
你知道,要是我把这半边桌子放下来,我们就可以一起玩
You know, if I take this half down, we could play together.

655
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:03,190
那我就把它放下来了
I'm just gonna take this half down.

656
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,230
别担心,别担心,我还有一个球
Don't worry. Don't worry. I got another ball.

657
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,730
没问题的
It's okay.

658
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:13,770
你想发球吗？
You wanna serve?

659
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,400
我来发球
I'll serve.

660
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:25,180
有个很好的消息,我们组织了一支橄榄球队
Really good news. We started a football team.

661
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:27,020
你喜欢橄榄球吗？
You like football?

662
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,650
和乒乓球有点像
It's kind of like Ping-Pong.

663
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:32,190
只不过球大一点,是鸡蛋形的,就和我的脑袋一样
Only the ball's a little bigger and egg-shaped, like my head.

664
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:36,390
说笑而已,别激动
Just a joke. Stay calm.

665
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,320
这样你就有个很好的机会把人扔到地上
Give you a good chance to throw people on the ground,

666
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:43,830
揍他们,就像你小时候那样,在你长成10英尺6英寸以前
hurt them like you used to when you were a kid, 10 feet 6 inches ago.

667
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,190
我们要和看守们比赛
We'd be playing the guards.

668
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,610
我想约翰大伯就是他们的安全卫
I think Papajohn's their safety.

669
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:59,610
我要打球

670
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:14,800
特利,要是没人冲到我身边,回头我们就再打乒乓球,好吗？
Turley, nobody gets to me. We'll play more Ping-Pong later, okay?

671
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,900
一！
Hut!

672
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,530
很有效
Effective.

673
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:29,900
- 好了 - 他把我鼻子打断了
- All right. - He brokeded my nose.

674
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,780
我不要再打球了
I don't wanna play no more.

675
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:37,210
嘿,嘿,嘿,斯韦托斯基,你说什么呢？
Hey, hey, hey. Switowski, what are you talking about?

676
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,050
这是橄榄球啊,受点伤难免的
This is football. Shit happens.

677
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,920
保罗,他把我鼻子打断了
Paul, he brokeded my nose.

678
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:43,560
好啦,别哭了
Okay. Stop crying.

679
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:46,720
好啦,这个我们能治好的,来了
All right. We can fix this. Here we go.

680
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:50,500
好,很好,很好
Okay. Good, good.

681
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,290
看上去怎样？
How's it look?

682
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,830
看上去怎样？看上去-- 看上去好像--好像比以前更好了
How's it look? It looks-- It looks like-- It looks better than before.

683
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:58,930
- 真的？ - 对,更加直了
- Really? - Yeah, it's straighter.

684
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:02,270
更加漂亮了,有点像年轻时候的麦克尔·杰克逊
More distinguished. Kind of like a young Michael Jackson.

685
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,670
我爱小麦克尔
I love little Michael.

686
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,540
那很好,那很好
That's great. That's great.

687
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,540
我看他是故意的
I think he did it on purpose.

688
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,690
不,他不是故意的
No, he didn't.

689
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:15,380
好吧,也可能是
Okay, maybe he did.

690
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:18,490
你该向他道歉,来吧,特利
You gotta apologize to him. Come on, Turley.

691
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:21,760
说对不起
Say you're sorry.

692
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,220
好啦,说吧
Come on. Say it.

693
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,150
对不起

694
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,400
他说对不起了,我让他说对不起了
He said he's sorry. I got him to say he's sorry.

695
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,200
对,对 我们都很感动
Yeah, yeah. We're all impressed.

696
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,310
看来不错,先生们,都很努力
Looking good, gentlemen. Way to work hard.

697
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:41,670
练得真好,保罗！我和姑娘们想让你看看
Good practice, Paul! Me and the girls wanna show you

698
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,380
- 我们的练习成果 - 好啊,让我看看
- what we've been practicing. - Okay, hit me.

699
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:47,750
来吧,上了 一、二、三
Come on, let's go. One, two, three.

700
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,860
给我一个@@
Give me a@@

701
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:54,360
D,D,给我一个I I,I,给我一个C
D, D, give me a I I, I, give me a C

702
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,550
C,给我一个--
C, give me a--

703
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,030
好了,好了！我看到了,到比赛时候再亮出来吧
All right, all right! I got it. Just save it for the game.

704
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:01,100
别装得不想看似的,布鲁西！
Don't act like you ain't want to see more, Brucie!

705
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,460
- 对,是你想要,朋友 - 不,你是想要我再吻你
- Yeah, you wish, pal. - No, you wish I'd kiss you again,

706
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:06,610
你的口臭就像八泡鲨鱼屎一样
because your breath smell like eight cans of shark shit.

707
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:08,330
就是用十英尺长的杆子碰她我都恶心
I wouldn't touch her with a 10-foot pole.

708
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:10,100
- 他说什么？ - 他是个变态
- What's he talking about? - He's a freak.

709
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:26,020
跑啊,阿甘,跑啊！ （《阿甘正传》里的台词）
Run, Forrest, run!

710
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,090
白人就是这样弹吉他的
That's how a white man plays guitar.

711
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,700
队长,他说他有些情报
Captain, he said he had some info.

712
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:42,360
你们在玩“Halo 2”,我以为这还没出呢
You guys have "Halo 2." I didn't even think that was out yet.

713
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,870
正经点 把音乐关了！
Focus. Turn the music off!

714
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,240
好,队长,你知道那些犯人吧？
Yeah, captain. You know them convicts?

715
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:49,280
他们现在有些很像样的球员了
They're starting to get some serious players.

716
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,610
可是他们最大的威胁是谁？是一个跑锋,麦吉特
But their biggest threat? A running back. Megget.

717
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:55,220
- 他很棒？ - 他很快
- He's good? - He's fast.

718
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:57,750
他非常非常快
He's really, really fast.

719
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,980
我是说,他太快了,很快的人在他面前都显得不快了
I mean, he's so fast, he makes fast people look not fast.

720
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:03,560
我明白了,他很快
I got it, he's fast.

721
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,630
那么现在让我们看看你的速度,快从这里滚出去吧
Now, why don't you show us your speed and get your pyro ass out of here.

722
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,330
是,长官 我这就走,对不起
Yes, sir. Here I go. I'm sorry.

723
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:25,780
有什么书可推荐吗,囚犯？
Any books you'd recommend, inmate?

724
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:28,590
没有,长官
No, sir.

725
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:32,310
我书读得不多
Not much of a reader.

726
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:36,890
得了,蛆虫,我以前经常看见你在这里读书
Oh, come on, now, maggot. I've seen you in here reading before.

727
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,360
这个活也是你自己要求的,对吗？
You requested this detail. Isn't that right?

728
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:46,330
不,我只是喜欢清静,长官
No. It's the quiet time I like, sir.

729
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:48,570
也许你会喜欢看这本书
Maybe you'd like to read this.

730
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:49,600
（黑人民权运动领袖马尔科姆·X的传记）

731
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:52,900
这是什么狗屁书？
What the hell kind of bullshit book is that?

732
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:55,440
这是历史,长官
It's historical. Sir.

733
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:58,210
为什么他会喜欢看关于一个四眼黑鬼的书？
Now, why would he want to read a book about a four-eyed nigger?

734
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:06,860
这个词是不是让你不高兴了？黑鬼？
Does the N word offend you, nigger?

735
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:09,250
没有,长官
No, sir.

736
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:18,430
对不起
Sorry about that.

737
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,670
帮我捡一下书你不介意吧,小子？
You mind fetching these books for me, boy?

738
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:26,010
不介意,长官
No, sir.

739
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:28,110
把它们捡起来,放到桌上
Just pick them up. Put them on the table.

740
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:32,940
给您
There you go.

741
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:40,450
你忘了一本
You forgot one.

742
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,830
你肯定很想打我们吧,唔？
Bet you'd like to hit us, huh?

743
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,260
打你们？长官？不
Hit you, sir? No.

744
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:56,500
你们都是我的朋友
Y'all my friends.

745
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,730
把它们捡起来
Pick these up.

746
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:25,030
上！
Go!

747
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,660
给我！我这里空了！我这里空了！
Hit me! I'm open! I'm open!

748
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:34,610
搞什么！我们还有一个星期就要打比赛了
Come on! We got one week before we play that game.

749
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:36,210
我们现在还是连传球都做不好
We can't complete a pass yet.

750
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:39,870
- 麦吉特总不能每一次都带球跑 - 我知道,教练
- Megget can't run the ball every play. - I know, coach.

751
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,450
他到底在笑什么？
What the hell is he smiling at?

752
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:00,060
这比赛最好是光明正大的
This better be on the up and up.

753
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:02,230
我可以保证
I guarantee it.

754
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,140
那咱们干吧
Let's do this shit.

755
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:05,900
咱们的邻居来了
There goes the neighborhood.

756
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:13,570
现在我再也没机会打球了
Now I'll never get to play.

757
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:42,770
你们看见了吧？你们看见了吧？迪克在此！
Did you see that? Did you see that? The Deac is here!

758
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,100
很好
Nice.

759
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:46,140
好,我们封住这里,封住这里
Okay, we seal off here, seal off here.

760
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:47,810
- 汉堡包 - 在
- Cheeseburger. - Yeah.

761
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,680
你要把这家伙放倒@@
You're just gonna chip this guy@@

762
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,370
痛啊
That stings.

763
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:11,330
没有大汉堡治不了的伤
It's nothing a Quarter Pounder can't fix.

764
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,170
上面有奶酪吗？
With cheese on it?

765
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:16,900
一！
Hut!

766
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:43,830
那小子在沙漠里都会得感冒,给你
Man, that boy would catch a cold in the desert. Here you go.

767
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,630
- 看来一切顺利 - 是啊
- Everything's looking up. - Yeah.

768
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,140
还有点小疮疤需要解决
Still got one more pain in the ass to deal with.

769
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:01,540
好,你们说怎样？要不要来点好球比赛？
All right, what do you say? How about a little best ball?

770
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:04,810
不要,我讨厌比赛,大家各打各的球吧
No, I hate that bullshit. Everyone play their own damn ball.

771
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:06,850
我靠,那是保罗·克鲁吗？
Holy shit, is that Paul Crewe?

772
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:10,790
你们觉得怎样？MVP来亲我的屁股了
How do you like that, boys? The MVP coming to kiss my ass.

773
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,760
那么,你有什么想法,保罗？
So, what's on your mind, Paul?

774
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,690
关于犯人昂格尔的问题
Got a problem with inmate Unger.

775

That's up to the warden.

- The flash is ready. - You don't need a flash. It's daylight.

780
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:33,510
哦,是我不对,我只想拍得好一点
Oh, my bad. I just want a good picture.

781
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:37,350
要知道,我认为我老婆在跟我结婚前和你上过床
You know, I think you had sex with my wife before I married her.

782
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:40,120
- 很抱歉 - 啊,才不呢
- Sorry about that. - Oh, hell, no.

783
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:43,520
假如她漂亮到可以和职业橄榄球选手搞一夜情
If she's hot enough to have a one-nighter with a pro football player,

784
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:45,520

咱们还是开门见山吧
Just cut to the chase, shall we?

791

You don't actually think you have a chance of winning, now, do you?

我们跳不出你的手心
We're gonna get our asses handed to us.

- What does that mean? - In the time you've been here,

797
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,050
你没有打过或接过一个电话
you haven't made or received one telephone call.

你没有拆过一封信

What do you give a damn about those slimeballs?

but, sunshine, we're gonna make them all count.

907
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:52,990
再来一杯好吗？
One more, please?

908
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:02,860
走吧
Let's go.

909
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,540
- 静一静,哥们 - 开始吧
- Quiet down. Guys. - Let's go.

910
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:15,580
在看看守们去年的比赛录像之前
Before we watch the guards' game film from last season,

911
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:20,240
我们的保罗·克鲁先生 要给大家送上一个特别节目
we have a special presentation from our very own Mr. Paul Crewe.

912
01:02:22,090 --> 01:02:23,890
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

913
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:26,780
怎么回事？
What's going on?

914
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:33,400
我又要再体验一遍这个？
Now I gotta relive this shit?

915
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,200
好耶
Yeah!

916
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:57,150
你可以说,我的朋友很会配合！
You can say this, my man's a team player!

917
01:02:58,990 --> 01:03:03,120
你知道他们怎么说：你一旦变老 就没有别的路了！
You know what they say. Once you go gray, there ain't no other way!

918
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:06,430
嘿,嘿,嘿,布鲁西！布鲁西！ 你觉得这个好玩,我很高兴
Hey, hey, hey. Brucie! Brucie! I'm glad you think that's funny,

919
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:08,690
因为我有些很好玩的东西给你们看
because I got something pretty funny to show you guys.

920
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:11,270
托尼,来吧 你们会喜欢的
Tony, hit it. You're gonna like this.

921
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:17,690
（洗衣间）

922
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:22,200
- 这到底是什么？ - 什么？很好啊,继续
- What the hell is this? - What? It's good. It keeps going.

923
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:24,540
- 嗨 - 我在这儿
- Hi. - Here I am.

924
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:26,450
关掉,关掉
Turn this shit off. Turn it off.

925
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,420
不行！
No!

926
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:36,460
对,对,对 很好玩 这是特技做出来的
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very funny. Trick photography.

927
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:47,300
没发生什么事 没发生什么事
Nothing happened. Nothing happened.

928
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:49,370
我是在表演摔跤,就这么回事
I was showing a little wrestling move. That's all.

929
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:51,170
暂停！
Knock it off!

930
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:52,780
暂停！
Knock it off!

931
01:03:53,310 --> 01:03:55,540
趁着看守还没回来
It's time we took a look at what we came here to see

932
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:57,680
我们该看看正经东西了
before the guards come back.

933
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:02,520
第一个录像是看守队 对德克萨斯南方队的进攻
The first film is the guards' offense against Texas Southern.

934
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,950
你们可以看到 他们用的是标准的叉骨阵形
Now, as you can see, they're running a standard wishbone.

935
01:04:12,970 --> 01:04:15,660
你是说这些畜牲在看我们的比赛录像
So you're telling me that these animals are watching our game films.

936
01:04:15,870 --> 01:04:17,700
- 对吗？ - 是的,老大
- Is that right? - Yes, sir, boss.

937
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:19,370
上赛季的比赛他们全搞到了
They got all last season.

938
01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:22,830
看来我们应该有所行动
Seems to me that we ought to do something about this.

939
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:24,700
你要我干什么？
What do you want me to do?

940
01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:27,070
你是罪犯 发挥想象力吧
You're the criminal. Be creative.

941
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:30,500
不过在比赛那天,假如我这么--
But on game day, if I so much as--

942
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:34,420
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

943
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:39,350
我不知道 我身上老是发热
I don't know. I've had hot flashes all shift,

944
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,850
现在我的乳头又让我难过得要命
and now my nipples are killing me.

945
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:43,690
我们干吗要关心你的乳头？
Why are we talking about your nipples?

946
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,650
不用 接着做你的事吧
We're not. Just go do what you're doing there.

947
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:48,230
哥们
Guys.

948
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:52,430
我要让克鲁完蛋
I want Crewe finished.

949
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:56,770
是,长官 你给了我灵感,长官 我有办法对付他
Yes, sir. You give me the inspiration, sir. I got something for him.

950
01:04:57,980 --> 01:04:59,200
一！
Hut!

951
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:06,580
各位！
Everybody!

952
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:09,410
集合！
Huddle up!

953
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:18,090
我们天天受罪,已经熬了很久
Every day we've been taking shit, for a long time.

954
01:05:18,730 --> 01:05:23,530
明天,就要报仇 现在,稍微想一想吧
Tomorrow, payback. Now, think about that for a second.

955
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:10,640
- 什么时候？ - 比赛时候！
- What time is it? - Game time!

956
01:06:10,850 --> 01:06:12,470
- 什么时候？ - 比赛时候！
- What time is it? - Game time!

957
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:16,140
- 什么时候？ - 比赛时候！
- What time is it? - Game time!

958
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:23,580
明天12:00,公车就会走,别迟到了！
Tomorrow, 1 2:00, the bus leaves. Don't be late!

959
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:26,780
凯尔泰克到底在哪儿？
Where the hell is Caretaker?

960
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:29,720
不知道
I don't know.

961
01:06:57,830 --> 01:07:00,380
给你的礼物,克鲁先生
A gift for you, Mr. Crewe.

962
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,920
他怎么听这种狗屁玩意？
How does he listen to that cracker shit?

963
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:35,880
我们现在是在一片不毛之地的中心
We're here deep in the heart of toothless country,

964
01:09:36,090 --> 01:09:38,680
从一个简陋的德克萨斯 高中体育馆向您直播
coming to you from a simple Texas high school stadium

965
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:41,120
这个体育馆已经为一件大事而作了翻新
that's been retrofitted for the big event.

966
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:43,700
当我的同事特拉维斯把我拖到 这里来的时候,我说：
Now, when my man T ravis tried to drag me out here, I said,

967
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:46,230
“你怎么回事？对袭击者队的球迷 采访太多,脑子坏掉了吗？
"What are you, brain-dead from talking to too many Raider fans?

968
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:47,460
这里不能做节目的 ”
It's not going to work."

969
01:09:47,670 --> 01:09:50,700
但事实是,这里可能将发生 载入史册的大事
But the fact of the matter is, this could shape up as an epic day.

970
01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:54,100
热狗摊主、大威力步枪 我喜欢这种组合
Hot-dog vendors, high-powered rifles, I love the combination.

971
01:09:54,310 --> 01:09:56,800
并且球迷也如此疯狂
And apparently so do the fans.

972
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:01,940
嗨！猪头们！
Hey, shitheads! Listen up!

973
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:03,980
立正！典狱长要讲话
Everybody on their feet for the warden.

974
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:10,820
安东尼,你还是坐着吧
Anthony, wow. You can sit down.

975
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:13,380
谢天谢地
Thank God.

976
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:17,860
先生们,得克萨斯州警方 很友善的
Gentlemen, Texas marshals have been kind enough

977
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:21,560
为我们提供了十二个神枪手
to supply us with a dozen of their finest sharpshooters.

978
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:25,500
你们如果想趁乱混到人群中
So for those of you thinking of mingling with the civilians

979
01:10:25,710 --> 01:10:27,330
或者是想逃走
or trying to make a break for it,

980
01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:29,310
就等着吃子弹吧
you will be shot.

981
01:10:31,010 --> 01:10:32,140
子弹会正中头部
In the head.

982
01:10:35,850 --> 01:10:39,010
让我们出去运动吧
Now, let's all go out there and have some fun!

983
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:45,120
克鲁！赛场见
Crewe! I'll see you on the field!

984
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:49,290
我觉得他爱上你了
I think he's in love with you.

985
01:10:50,370 --> 01:10:52,360
好了,大家听着
All right, listen up.

986
01:10:52,570 --> 01:10:56,470
我知道凯尔退克不在这儿 大家很难鼓足士气
I know it's hard to get psyched for the game without Caretaker being here.

987
01:10:57,270 --> 01:10:59,870
但是这个小东西
But somehow that sick, skinny bastard

988
01:11:00,070 --> 01:11:04,070
在阴间也会给我们打气
found a way to get us all fired up from beyond the grave.

989
01:11:05,210 --> 01:11:07,680
凯尔退克给我们的最后礼物
Caretaker's last gift to us.

990
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:10,580
班涛,我觉得这个是给你的
Battle, I presume this is yours.

991
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:14,510
我觉得还不够大
I still don't think that's big enough.

992
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:19,350
- 就这些？ - 不是,还有
- That's it? - No, that ain't it.

993
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:22,160
凯尔泰克说过他会弄些 适合我们穿的
Caretaker said he'd find us some gear to wear.

994
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,930
而且他把我们的名字也 弄上去了
I think he found us a name too.

995
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:36,440
邪恶战车！邪恶战车！ 邪恶战车！
Mean Machine! Mean Machine! Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

996
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:53,760
下午好,欢迎收看ESPN体育台 这场特殊的橄榄球赛
Good afternoon and welcome to a very special edition of ESPN football.

997
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,330
今天比赛将在来自阿伦维尔联邦监狱 狱警组成的半职业球队
As today, the semipro Allenville Federal Prison guards

998
01:11:57,530 --> 01:12:00,160
与他们所看守的犯人之间展开
will be taking on the very prisoners they guard.

999
01:12:00,370 --> 01:12:03,800
这个特殊的比赛当然 也由特殊的主持人来播报
And with this special game, folks, comes a special broadcast,

1000
01:12:04,010 --> 01:12:07,270
所以我和娃娃脸鲍勃 一起来到这个播音间
as I'm joined in the booth by Baby Face Bob.

1001
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,200
跟大家问个好,鲍勃
Say hi to the folks, Bob-O.

1002
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:12,610
克里斯,插入广告
Chris, we went to a commercial.

1003
01:12:12,810 --> 01:12:16,010
节目过程中 我们应该互相交换意见
This job, Bob, it's a lot of give and take.

1004
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:19,020
所以我把话题转给你的时候 大胆的对听众说吧说吧
So when I bring you in, don't be afraid to talk to the folks.

1005
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,320
除非你不原意
Unless you don't want to.

1006
01:12:26,730 --> 01:12:28,250
现在出场的是囚犯队
And here come the cons,

1007
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:32,420
领队是前美国橄榄球协会最有价值 球员四分卫保罗克鲁
Ied by former NFL MVP quarterback Paul Crewe.

1008
01:12:37,670 --> 01:12:40,270
天啊！！乖乖！
Holy shit. Hey, hey, hey.

1009
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,100
嗨！你们好！
Well, hello. How are you?

1010
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:43,780
离姑娘们远点！
Back away from the girls!

1011
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:46,110
- 快点 - 给我打电话！
- Hey, now. - Call me!

1012
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:49,780
你怎么也穿成这样？
What the hell are you dressed up for?

1013
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:53,550
你以为我花14年呆在监狱 只是为了看看比赛？
Hey, I didn't spend 14 years in the joint just to watch this game.

1014
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:55,550
那边是高度警戒的露天看台
And there in the high-security bleachers

1015
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:59,120
以及举止端庄的囚犯
are the good-behavior cons, along with their@@

1016
01:12:59,330 --> 01:13:00,420
还有……貌似拉拉队员……
@@cheerleaders?

1017
01:13:01,630 --> 01:13:03,650
我们是邪恶战车
We're the mean machine Don't mean to dis you

1018
01:13:03,870 --> 01:13:06,460
我们要打败你 然后给你香吻
We're gonna kick your ass And then we'll kiss you

1019
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:09,460
嗨嗨哈一！
Hey! Ho! What?

1020
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:14,570
不是我干的
I didn't do it!

1021
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:26,640
Come on, Batt!

1022
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:44,030
- 快看 - 怎么回事？
- What's that? - Did you see that?

1023
01:13:47,910 --> 01:13:48,970
真见鬼
Damn it!

1024
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:54,180
帕约翰正在二十码处,十码了 他要得分了
Papajohn's at the 20, the 10. And he will score.

1025
01:13:57,950 --> 01:14:00,050
做个美梦吧！贱种
Sweet dreams, bitch.

1026
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:02,350
这是一次90码的回攻
That's a 90-yard return.

1027
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:06,250
说句老实话我觉得 囚犯似乎更喜欢打狱警
And I gotta tell you, the cons seem more interested in hitting the guards

1028
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:08,190
而不是擒抱的方式来 阻止对方前进
than tackling the ball carrier.

1029
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:13,300
嗨！老妈,老爸 谢谢你们把我从学校接回来
Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad. Thanks for picking me up from school.

1030
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:16,940
今天最大的新闻是
And here comes the big story of the day.

1031
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:19,500
保罗克鲁 正在他的三年服刑期内
Paul Crewe, serving a three-year sentence,

1032
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:23,070
这是他六年前被美国橄榄球协会 禁赛以来第一次正式出席比赛
hasn't played since he was banned from the NFL six years ago.

1033
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:26,410
中位,换位
Center, shift it! Shift it!

1034
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:31,410
嗨！大脚怪兽
Hey, Sasquatch!

1035
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,410
20码,一！
Twenty, hut!

1036
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:39,850
克鲁背传 特里没有及时防卫
Crewe drops back to pass. Turley's leaving him unprotected.

1037
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:42,760
失球
Fumble!

1038
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:46,820
妈的
Holy shit!

1039
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:50,300
真见鬼
Goddamn it.

1040
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:53,030
这个大家伙要吃记侵人犯规了
That's gonna be a personal foul on the big guy.

1041
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:56,040
囚犯队真是出师不利
And this is certainly an inauspicious start for the cons.

1042
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:59,540
好了,你摆平他了 现在好好坐我的后卫
Come here! All right! You got him. Now, protect me!

1043
01:15:00,010 --> 01:15:02,280
我们上！压倒他们
Let's go! Hold them!

1044
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:07,350
现在的形势是科纳瓦和 狱警进攻小队
And here comes Knauer and that big offensive unit for the guards.

1045
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:13,350
八十六
Eighty-six.

1046
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:15,150
回你的笼子去
Back to your cell.

1047
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:17,960
一！二！
Hut! Hut!

1048
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:26,710
囚犯们的后防空虚 狱警得分
Knauer has Potter wide open. Touchdown, guards.

1049
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:30,340
仅在开场90秒
- Son of a bitch! - And in the first 90 seconds,

1050
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:32,740
狱警的比分扶摇直上 因为两个攻方持球得分（各6分）
the guards are up by two touchdowns.

1051
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:36,210
看上去这个比赛会速战速决
This one looks like it could be over early.

1052
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:37,910
抱歉
Sorry.

1053
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:41,020
你们高兴什么？ 这是14：0的大比分
What are we celebrating for?! It's 1 4-nothing!

1054
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:44,680
你们要真想摆平那些混蛋 应该在记分板上体现
You guys wanna beat these assholes, do it on the scoreboard!

1055
01:15:45,390 --> 01:15:49,060
你没事吧？ 天啊,你受伤了？
Are you okay? Oh, God, you're not hurt, are you?

1056
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:50,960
你怎么婆婆妈妈的！
Jesus, you sound like my mother.

1057
01:15:51,170 --> 01:15:55,760
你要是想哭就尽情地哭吧 我会陪着你哭的
Listen, if you wanna cry, you go ahead and cry. I'll cry with you.

1058
01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:58,910
滚开,回赛场上去 好好教训他们
Get off me! Get back out there and kick some ass!

1059
01:15:59,110 --> 01:16:02,200
你怎么对我大喊大叫的？ 我只是关心你
Why are you yelling at me? All I did was care!

1060
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:07,580
打断腿可以医好
Look! A broken leg will heal.

1061
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:10,680
但是如果邪恶战车输了 那将是永久的耻辱
A loss to the Mean Machine lasts forever.

1062
01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:14,350
对不起,伙计们
Sorry, guys.

1063
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:18,290
我也很抱歉
Yeah, yeah. Me too.

1064
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:20,460
好了,我们重新开始
All right. Now, let's get started!

1065
01:16:22,830 --> 01:16:25,660
上场要给他们点颜色
Now, get the hell out there! Let's go!

1066
01:16:39,050 --> 01:16:40,040
这边,这边
Way to go! Way to go!

1067
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:42,980
这可是囚犯队有史以来 第一次出现的好迹象
There's the first sign of life from the cons.

1068
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:47,120
看看克鲁小丑能做点什么名堂
Let's see if Paul "Motley" Crewe can make something happen.

1069
01:16:47,290 --> 01:16:48,250
一！
Hut!

1070
01:16:48,490 --> 01:16:52,360
克鲁要丢球了 他找到迪肯的空当
On first down, Crewe will throw. He's got Deacon wide open.

1071
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:56,390
这个应该是犯规
That's gotta be pass interference.

1072
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:58,430
但是裁判示意没事
But the ref is waving it off.

1073
01:16:58,630 --> 01:17:00,690
怎么回事?
- What?! - Oh, come on!

1074
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:03,370
这件事可太不让人舒适
Come on, now. I'm in this hellhole for less than that.

1075
01:17:03,570 --> 01:17:06,270
- 像个男人那样公正判罚 - 没问题
- Be a man and make a call. - You're right.

1076
01:17:06,470 --> 01:17:09,030
黑队88号！无体育道德
Unsportsmanlike conduct! Eighty-eight black!

1077
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:10,470
什么？
What?!

1078
01:17:11,450 --> 01:17:12,570
好了
Come on!

1079
01:17:14,550 --> 01:17:16,180
真是垃圾！
This is baby-back bullshit!

1080
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:18,180
冷静,我们继续
- Bullshit, D. - Calm down. Let it go.

1081
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:21,420
这个可真是个可以的判罚
Let's call that one a questionable call.

1082
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:23,350
蓝色42方案
Blue 42, hut!

1083
01:17:25,230 --> 01:17:28,890
球传给了麦吉特,他转身到外围 位置不错
The give is to Megget. He spins to the outside. Megget has room.

1084
01:17:31,070 --> 01:17:33,590
他到了35码区,40码区
He's at the 35. The 40.

1085
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:36,590
他被人拽倒了 拽的是头盔
He's brought down hard, by his facemask.

1086
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,130
你看到了吗？ 他拽拉我的头盔
What? Oh, come on, man! That was a facemask!

1087
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:42,470
- 这个你也不判罚？ - 我觉得这个正当防守
- You're not gonna call that? - I saw a clean tackle, sir.

1088
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:44,610
你是干什么的？ 你真的这么想？
What you looking at? Are you serious?

1089
01:17:44,810 --> 01:17:46,970
去你和你的假释审批官争论吧 你这个罪犯
Tell it to the parole board, criminal.

1090
01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:49,240
这可太荒唐了
I mean, this is absurd.

1091
01:17:49,450 --> 01:17:51,850
我们遇到这种裁判员 根本没有赢的机会
We can't win with the refs on the payroll!

1092
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:55,080
我有办法了
Listen up. I got an idea to end all this bullshit.

1093
01:17:55,290 --> 01:17:57,620
来大家振作
Come on, let's all stay up! Come on!

1094
01:17:59,490 --> 01:18:00,930
就位
Down, set!

1095
01:18:01,230 --> 01:18:02,390
红队58
Red 58.

1096
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:03,930
掩护你的人
Cover your man!

1097
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:06,270
红队58
Red 58. Hut!

1098
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:20,240
这一计可够他受的
That one hurt my marble sack.

1099
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:23,680
好了
All right!

1100
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:25,680
- 你怎么样？ - 没事
- You all right? - Yeah.

1101
01:18:25,890 --> 01:18:27,350
- 现在该第几次进攻？ - 第五次
- What down is it? - Fifth.

1102
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:29,750
- 算第四次吧 - 好的
- No, no. It would be fourth down. - Okay.

1103
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:32,750
他好像在说：“我的‘球’啊”

1104
01:18:33,830 --> 01:18:37,030
你觉得怎么样？ 我这次是不是该左路进攻？
What do you think? Should I go for the left nut this time?

1105
01:18:37,530 --> 01:18:39,620
向下！开球吧
Underneath! Let's go!

1106
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:41,730
裁判你挡着比赛了 你在这个位置比较好
Ref, you gotta get in the game! Right over here!

1107
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:46,170
我不太清楚, 但是就现在的进攻形势,囚犯队任务艰巨
Well, I don't quite get this, but on fourth and 22, the cons are gonna go for it.

1108
01:18:46,370 --> 01:18:47,900
进攻,就位
Down, set!

1109
01:18:48,110 --> 01:18:49,580
红队58
Red 58.

1110
01:18:49,780 --> 01:18:51,300
红队58
Red 58. Hut!

1111
01:19:00,590 --> 01:19:03,110
你可得保护好你那“小棒球”
You gotta always protect the McNuggets.

1112
01:19:06,590 --> 01:19:09,360
从现在开始, 你公平判罚怎么样？
How about from now on, you call a fair game? How's that sound?

1113
01:19:09,730 --> 01:19:10,720
好吧
Sounds good.

1114
01:19:10,930 --> 01:19:12,870
不错,润润
Okay. Wet Willie.

1115
01:19:14,270 --> 01:19:15,630
我知道你喜欢
Yeah, you like that.

1116
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,640
在看过这么一系列荒诞的进攻后
And so the guards will take over

1117
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:25,300
现在轮到狱警队来进攻了
after one of the strangest offensive series I've ever seen.

1118
01:19:25,650 --> 01:19:28,710
大家都熟悉战场上的情况了吧
Okay, boys. We know who doesn't have any balls out there now.

1119
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:31,410
我们有信心吗？
Have we got any? Have we got some balls?

1120
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:35,150
- 当然！ - 去吧！打垮他们
- Yeah! - All right! Let's go kick some ass!

1121
01:19:35,590 --> 01:19:38,220
斯韦托就位
Come on, Swit, stand them up, baby.

1122
01:19:38,430 --> 01:19:42,190
白队50注意
White 50. White 50. Hut, hut, hut!

1123
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,830
科纳瓦,行动迅速 带给我们场闪电战
Knauer, play action. Here comes the blitz.

1124
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:51,430
斯韦托斯基真是个大块 他的擒抱防卫看上去就像有腿的可乐售货机
Switowski is so big, it's like being tackled by a Coke machine with legs.

1125
01:19:51,970 --> 01:19:53,560
真是有趣
This is fun!

1126
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:57,100
很高兴看到你笑,鲍勃
Nice to see you smiling, Bob.

1127
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:59,310
谢谢,克里斯
Thanks, Chris.

1128
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:02,300
直达90码
Green 90! Hut!

1129
01:20:02,650 --> 01:20:04,950
球传给了麦吉特
Third and 5, and the give is to Megget.

1130
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:07,680
他到了40码线 进攻看来停下了
He's to the 40, where he'll come up short.

1131
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:10,520
但是特利想法向前推进
But look at Turley push the pile.

1132
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,020
克鲁也上了
And now Crewe.

1133
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:14,690
第一次进攻结束
And that's a first down!

1134
01:20:16,230 --> 01:20:19,530
场上情形进入白热化 要是没人来控制
And look out. Boy, somebody better take control of this game soon,

1135
01:20:19,730 --> 01:20:21,890
我看要出人命了
or they're gonna need body bags on the sidelines.

1136
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:23,130
来吧,伙计们
Let's go, guys.

1137
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:24,460
第二次四分之一进攻开始
Start of the second quarter.

1138
01:20:24,670 --> 01:20:27,700
虽然囚犯队失利两次 但是显然他们并没有失去势头
Cons still down by two touchdowns, but they finally have some momentum.

1139
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:29,240
Hut!

1140
01:20:31,710 --> 01:20:33,910
克鲁把球急传给了麦吉特
Crewe with a shovel pass to Megget.

1141
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:36,950
麦吉特的进攻结束
And Megget scrambles for a first down.

1142
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:39,120
你跟我耍花招
Oh, you fooled me.

1143
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:41,220
- 你种着了吧 - 是啊
- I got you there, didn't l? - You did.

1144
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:43,950
恩格尔哈特你是 你队友里长得最好看的一个
You know, Engleheart, you are the best-looking guy on your team.

1145
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:48,690
保罗你是这些人中 第一个对我说这些……
You know, Paul, in the midst of all this, for you to say something like that is@@

1146
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:50,960
来吧来吧,继续防守
Come on, let's go. Let's go, D.

1147
01:20:51,170 --> 01:20:53,290
这次进攻从35码起
First and 10 at the guards' 35.

1148
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:56,400
克鲁把球中传给了迪肯莫斯
Crewe dumps it over the middle to Deacon Moss.

1149
01:20:56,670 --> 01:21:01,800
而他继续将战线推进了13码
And he's hammered at the 17 for a 13-yard pickup, and that's a first down.

1150
01:21:02,410 --> 01:21:04,140
克鲁正极力
- 一！
Hut! - Crewe, trying to get his team

1151
01:21:04,350 --> 01:21:05,810
刷新比分
on the scoreboard.

1152
01:21:06,510 --> 01:21:08,070
他掷出了
He will throw.

1153
01:21:10,220 --> 01:21:13,120
迪肯莫斯接住了 而且得分
And it's caught by Deacon Moss for a touchdown!

1154
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:15,420
太好啦！
All right!

1155
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:19,620
好了他们今天终于有幸 出现在比分牌上了
And so there'll be no shutout today, as the cons are on the board.

1156
01:21:20,190 --> 01:21:23,460
别叹息了 我们两队都尽力打比赛呢
Quit booing, people. Both teams are trying very hard!

1157
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:27,160
你是怎么回事？ 别把自己当成是啦啦队长
What the hell's wrong with you? Stop acting like a damn cheerleader!

1158
01:21:27,370 --> 01:21:29,500
- 这是运动员精神,你也试试？ - 闭嘴
- Sportsmanship, try it. - Shut up.

1159
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:34,480
Damn.

1160
01:21:34,710 --> 01:21:37,870
比分2：1上半时还剩一分钟 丹哈姆现在是后卫
2:1 1 left in the first half. And Dunham is back in at fullback.

1161
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:40,950
真是重磅出击 他6英尺2英寸260磅
And he is a load, at 6'2", 260.

1162
01:21:43,420 --> 01:21:45,440
丹哈姆 突破了对手的擒抱
Dunham, breaking tackles.

1163
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:47,380
他继续进攻
He refuses to go down.

1164
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:51,860
最后还是在15码处倒地
But he finally does after a 1 5-yard gain.

1165
01:21:53,390 --> 01:21:55,560
你知道为什么只有 白人可以玩转橄榄球吗?
That's how a white man runs a football.

1166
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:58,560
如果是我在防守 我会让你更难看
If I was on D, I'd crack you square in that egg-ass head of yours.

1167
01:21:58,770 --> 01:22:01,560
但是你不是防守队员 小贱货
Yeah, but you ain't on D. Are you, bitch?

1168
01:22:03,070 --> 01:22:05,370
斯韦托斯基！过来
Switowski! Come here.

1169
01:22:05,870 --> 01:22:08,000
你知道那个坏蛋 在图书馆怎么说我？
Do you know what he said to me in the library?

1170
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:14,510
没错,让他出局
Yes. Him. Out.

1171
01:22:17,990 --> 01:22:20,950
防守防守
D, D, defense D, D, defense

1172
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:23,350
看来囚犯队还是没有对抗 丹哈姆的良策
The cons don't seem to have an answer for Dunham,

1173
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:27,120
谁能轻易拉平12比分呢
who's averaging close to 12 yards a carry this half.

1174
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:29,890
突进67
Green 67.

1175
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:31,960
突进67
Green 67. Hut!

1176
01:22:35,870 --> 01:22:39,100
丹哈姆不敌斯韦托斯基
Oh, what a hit on Dunham by Switowski.

1177
01:22:41,710 --> 01:22:44,080
我觉得我摆平他了
I think I made him shit himself.

1178
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:46,400
我觉得他被摆平了
- Shit! - I think he just shit himself.

1179
01:22:46,810 --> 01:22:49,010
我觉得他被摆平了
I think he just shit himself.

1180
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:52,740
天啊 摆平他可真不容易
Good Lord. This guy shit himself bigtime.

1181
01:22:52,950 --> 01:22:56,290
哈一！是我摆平他的
See? I told you I made him shit himself!

1182
01:22:57,060 --> 01:22:59,920
我会去医院送书给他的
Yo! I'll make sure I send them books to the hospital, pimp.

1183
01:23:00,130 --> 01:23:01,790
还有尿布
And some diapers.

1184
01:23:03,430 --> 01:23:06,160
还有19秒 这里有很多草皮
Nineteen seconds. We got a lot of ground to cover.

1185
01:23:06,370 --> 01:23:08,700
你们还记得我们 在泥浆上的训练吗？
So you bastards remember that play we practiced in the mud?

1186
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:11,740
泥浆？ 这里是正规的赛场！
What are you talking about? That was some schoolyard bullshit.

1187
01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:14,930
那我们就玩点赛场把戏
Yeah. Let's try some schoolyard bullshit.

1188
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:18,240
来吧,防守
Come on, D, let's go.

1189
01:23:18,450 --> 01:23:21,350
进攻吧88号
Down, set! Green 88.

1190
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:23,010
进攻吧88号
Green 88. Hut!

1191
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:27,950
时钟开始运转,克鲁把球传给了麦吉特 是反方向的
The clock starts to run. Crewe hands the ball to Megget. It's a reverse.

1192
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:30,310
汉堡包埃迪拿到了球
Cheeseburger Eddy's got it.

1193
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:32,220
前进吧
Go, baby, go!

1194
01:23:32,830 --> 01:23:34,820
他侧传给迪肯
He laterals to Deacon.

1195
01:23:36,030 --> 01:23:37,390
阻止他！
T ackle him!

1196
01:23:38,670 --> 01:23:39,860
传给特里
To Turley.

1197
01:23:40,070 --> 01:23:42,730
时钟继续运转 球传给了布鲁西
The clock is running. To Brucie.

1198
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:44,960
又给了卡尔-斯坦福
Shades of Cal-Stanford.

1199
01:23:45,170 --> 01:23:46,660
又回到克鲁手里
Back to Crewe.

1200
01:23:47,410 --> 01:23:49,140
他掷给麦吉特
He tosses to Megget.

1201
01:23:49,340 --> 01:23:50,370
阻止他
T ackle him!

1202
01:23:54,250 --> 01:23:57,080
看看小麦吉特跑起来的样子
And look at that little Megget run.

1203
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:59,010
还剩3秒了
Three seconds left.

1204
01:24:00,290 --> 01:24:01,310
加油吧！
Yeah! Go!

1205
01:24:02,420 --> 01:24:07,590
没人拦得住他,得分
He could go all the way. Touchdown!

1206
01:24:13,170 --> 01:24:14,290
你们看到了吧？！
Did you see that?!

1207
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:15,870
在那样叫一下
Do that sound again.

1208
01:24:17,870 --> 01:24:19,170
我很喜欢
I like that.

1209
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:24,540
这可真是奇迹般的比赛
And so, on a miraculous play,

1210
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:28,680
囚犯队在上半场扳平比分 14平
the cons end the first half with the score: 14-all.

1211
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:35,450
注意！
Bring it in.

1212
01:24:36,190 --> 01:24:39,520
你们知道你们要输给谁？
Do you have any idea who's beating you out there?

1213
01:24:39,730 --> 01:24:41,890
这肯定是爆炸新闻
This was supposed to be a blowout,

1214
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:45,550
而且整个国家的人都在看着我们
and they're showing you up in front of the whole nation.

1215
01:24:46,630 --> 01:24:48,260
整个国家
The whole nation!

1216
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:50,860
我喜欢他生气的样子
I like it when he's angry.

1217
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:55,800
- 我跟你说了！ - 这边走
- I told you! - Way to go, baby, way to go.

1218
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:05,050
你觉得你在做什么？
What in the hell do you think you're doing out there?

1219
01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:06,880
打比赛！
Playing football, sir.

1220
01:25:08,590 --> 01:25:10,420
我可没说让你赢
I didn't say nothing about winning.

1221
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:12,990
我们没赢,至少现在
We're not winning. Not yet.

1222
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:18,560
你这个给自己找麻烦 克鲁先生
You got yourself in quite a predicament, Mr. Crewe.

1223
01:25:18,770 --> 01:25:21,230
- 是吗？ - 听好了
- Is that right? - See, it's just come to my attention

1224
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:23,490
昂格尔已经因为谋杀凯尔泰克
that inmate Unger has been taken into custody

1225
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:25,170
被特殊监管了
for the murder of Caretaker.

1226
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:27,740
- 很好 - 是的,是件好事
- Good. - Oh, yeah, it's good.

1227
01:25:28,210 --> 01:25:31,580
还有件事,他说他有个同伙
Only thing is, he claims to have an accomplice.

1228
01:25:32,010 --> 01:25:33,780
他说是你是合谋
Claims you knew all about it.

1229
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:37,180
而且他说是你让凯尔泰克 去你的牢房的
Hell, he even says you sent Caretaker to your cell.

1230
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:39,550
胡说八道
Bullshit.

1231
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:42,950
科纳瓦上尉说他看到你和昂格尔 共同策划整个事件
Captain Knauer says he saw you planning it with Unger.

1232
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:46,050
这些成不了法庭的证据
There's no way that could hold up in court.

1233
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:47,250
法庭？
Court?

1234
01:25:49,130 --> 01:25:53,500
小子！在阿伦维尔会有法律？ 一切都是我说了算
Hell, boy, in Allenville, I'm the judge, I'm the jury,

1235
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:57,860
而且鉴于你的特殊情况 我还可以为你执行死刑
and in your particular case, I'm the executioner.

1236
01:25:58,740 --> 01:25:59,760
你要怎么样？
What do you want?

1237
01:26:00,310 --> 01:26:01,930
我要你输了比赛
I want you to lose.

1238
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:03,300
我做不到
I can't do that.

1239
01:26:03,510 --> 01:26:06,500
你当然可以 而且,你很有经验
Of course you can. After all, you've had plenty of practice.

1240
01:26:06,710 --> 01:26:10,150
但是你要知道 输赢对他们来说更重要
But the men. It's more important to them than it is to you.

1241
01:26:11,390 --> 01:26:13,440
没关系,你自己选择
Okay. Suit yourself.

1242
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:17,260
就在监狱里继续碌碌无为的 待个25年怎么样
Spend the next 25 years of your useless life in prison.

1243
01:26:19,490 --> 01:26:21,220
好吧,我同意
All right, I'll do it.

1244
01:26:25,230 --> 01:26:29,070
但是不要伤害我的人 你们赢了就行了好吗?
But I don't want my guys hurt. You get ahead, you coast. We clear?

1245
01:26:29,270 --> 01:26:31,970
没问题,我要领先两个 攻方持球触地分
Fine. Right after I get a two-touchdown lead.

1246
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:36,300
我告诉你什么最困扰我 典狱长
I tell you what bothers me the most, warden.

1247
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:41,240
我担心你到了外边以后
That you're not gonna be out there on that field with us,

1248
01:26:41,450 --> 01:26:43,280
可能得不到你想要的
getting what you got coming to you.

1249
01:26:46,390 --> 01:26:49,220
胜利会属于我
The only thing coming to me is victory.

1250
01:26:51,390 --> 01:26:52,820
邪恶战车
Mean Machine.

1251
01:26:54,430 --> 01:26:55,660
不错的名字
It's cute.

1252
01:26:58,830 --> 01:27:00,560
-我们走吧 - 我们会赢的
- Let's go, boy! - We can do it, baby!

1253
01:27:00,770 --> 01:27:02,260
上尉
Captain.

1254
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:04,600
你给我保证吗？
May I have a word?

1255
01:27:04,810 --> 01:27:07,300
别担心,典狱长 我们会尽力的
Don't worry, warden, we'll take care of business.

1256
01:27:07,510 --> 01:27:08,630
我已经稳操胜卷
I already have.

1257
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:11,700
我们可以自己打赢的
What? We can win this on our own.

1258
01:27:11,910 --> 01:27:15,970
上尉,我不会听天由命的
Captain, a man in my position doesn't leave things to chance.

1259
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:19,850
听着,等你领先3个触地得分后
Now, after you get a comfortable three-touchdown lead,

1260
01:27:20,050 --> 01:27:22,890
我希望你们继续猛打
I want you to inflict as much pain as humanly possible.

1261
01:27:23,090 --> 01:27:25,290
可别放松明白吗？
Do not let up, you hear?

1262
01:27:25,660 --> 01:27:28,560
我要让这些囚犯知道谁说了算！
I want those cons to understand who owns them.

1263
01:27:29,430 --> 01:27:30,730
我说的清楚吗？
Do I make myself clear?

1264
01:27:30,930 --> 01:27:32,230
是的先生！
Oh, yes, sir.

1265
01:27:33,030 --> 01:27:34,000
很好
Good.

1266
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:38,390
下半场要开球了
There's the kickoff, and we're under way in the second half.

1267
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:47,240
麦吉特最终在对方33码处被断下
Megget is finally brought down at the guards' 33,

1268
01:27:47,450 --> 01:27:49,040
保罗克鲁在这里接替他
where Paul Crewe will take over.

1269
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:51,050
以及上半时战果
And what a first half he's had.

1270
01:27:51,250 --> 01:27:52,510
大家加油啊
Here we go! Here we go!

1271
01:27:55,690 --> 01:27:56,990
进攻！就位
Down, set!

1272
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:59,890
45码！
Y 45. Hut!

1273
01:28:00,790 --> 01:28:03,260
克鲁过了第一个10码
On first and 10, Crewe will pass.

1274
01:28:03,460 --> 01:28:05,160
他找到迪肯的空当
- He's got Deacon wide open. - Come on.

1275
01:28:05,370 --> 01:28:06,530
失败了
Oh, incomplete.

1276
01:28:06,730 --> 01:28:07,830
没关系,继续努力
It's okay. Get your head up.

1277
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:09,370
没关系
It's all right, man.

1278
01:28:11,370 --> 01:28:12,600
来吧,泡利
Come on, Paulie.

1279
01:28:12,810 --> 01:28:16,070
第二轮,克鲁依旧期待 从迪肯处进攻
Second and 10 from the 33. Crewe's looking for Deacon once again.

1280
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:18,440
他那又空当
- He's open! - He's open!

1281
01:28:19,110 --> 01:28:23,010
但是扔过了 被帕约翰接住了
But overthrows it. And it's picked off by Papajohn.

1282
01:28:23,220 --> 01:28:24,740
看着,他反攻了
Look out! He might go.

1283
01:28:26,350 --> 01:28:28,010
说再见
Say goodbye.

1284
01:28:28,790 --> 01:28:29,780
得分
Touchdown!

1285
01:28:31,860 --> 01:28:35,420
今天克鲁犯的第一个错误
The first mistake Crewe's made all day.

1286
01:28:38,470 --> 01:28:42,200
没关系的 我们会追回来
Short memory, baby. We'll get it back. We'll get it back.

1287
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,030
防御！
Defense, let's do this!

1288
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:46,830
上午8：38,第三次进攻
8:38 left in the third quarter,

1289
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:49,030
克鲁正在为后半时努力
and Crewe has struggled thus far in the second half.

1290
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:50,650
Hut!

1291
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:54,310
把球扔给麦吉特 天啊,又失手了
The pitch to Megget. Oh, my! That ball is live!

1292
01:28:55,350 --> 01:28:56,940
被兰伯特捡到
It's picked up by Lambert.

1293
01:28:57,150 --> 01:29:00,420
他在15码处,10码 得分在望
He's at the 1 5, the 1 0, and he will score!

1294
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:03,890
得分！！
Yeah! T ouchdown! Yeah!

1295
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:08,290
克鲁摔倒了很慢的爬起来
Crewe took a shot on that play and he's getting up slowly.

1296
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:11,930
于此同时,狱警队在边场庆祝
Meanwhile, in the end zone, the guards have something to celebrate,

1297
01:29:12,130 --> 01:29:14,620
庆祝他们连续两个 越过对方球门线的六分
as they find themselves up by two touchdowns.

1298
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:18,400
后半场的保罗克鲁 可真是发挥失常
This is simply a different Paul Crewe we're seeing here in the second half.

1299
01:29:18,610 --> 01:29:21,100
保罗克鲁老矣 这么写吧
There's the old Paul Crewe we love to write about.

1300
01:29:21,310 --> 01:29:23,040
你在赛场上怎么回事？
What the hell are you doing out there?

1301
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:24,730
我不行了
I'm done.

1302
01:29:26,050 --> 01:29:27,510
我完了,就是这样
I'm out. That's it.

1303
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:31,680
- 你哪受伤了？ - 膝盖
- Where you hurting? - My knee.

1304
01:29:31,890 --> 01:29:33,910
- 我觉得没事 - 是的
- Seems okay to me. - Well, it ain't.

1305
01:29:36,590 --> 01:29:40,420
如果保罗不上场 谁来做四分卫？
If Crewe can't go, I don't know how deep these guys are at quarterback.

1306
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:45,930
狱警队将尽力防卫麦吉特
The guards will try to keep it away from Megget, so they'll pooch kick.

1307
01:29:46,130 --> 01:29:47,400
完美的接球
Fair catch. Fair catch.

1308
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:50,200
大东尼正为完美接球叫喊
As Big Tony calls for the fair catch.

1309
01:29:50,670 --> 01:29:54,330
看看,这是有史以来最慢的撞击
Watch out. That was as late a hit as I've ever seen.

1310
01:29:56,110 --> 01:29:59,910
而且人们看上去很不欣赏这个
And even some of the home crowd not liking that one.

1311
01:30:00,090 --> 01:30:01,150
伙伴,撑着点
Hang in there, partner.

1312
01:30:01,380 --> 01:30:05,370
玉米罐,玉米罐 我没事的
Can of corn. Can of corn, and I'll be fine. Can of corn.

1313
01:30:08,490 --> 01:30:10,680
我也不好过
Yeah, I'd have a hard time looking at me too.

1314
01:30:11,260 --> 01:30:12,380
布鲁西
Brucie.

1315
01:30:12,590 --> 01:30:13,680
在这,教练
Yeah, coach.

1316
01:30:13,890 --> 01:30:17,350
这种进攻最适合你了,上吧
You're the only one that knows this offense, son. Now, do it.

1317
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:19,930
替换受伤的保罗克鲁的人是
Coming into the game, replacing the injured Paul Crewe,

1318
01:30:20,130 --> 01:30:21,460
1号,布鲁西
is number 1, Brucie.

1319
01:30:21,670 --> 01:30:23,500
好了来吧 克鲁打的太烂了
All right, all right. Crewe's playing like shit.

1320
01:30:23,700 --> 01:30:25,800
那时他自己的问题 我来了形势会好转的
That's his problem. I'm gonna bring us back.

1321
01:30:26,010 --> 01:30:28,370
我们来个鹞子翻身
Right, 32 Flex Dive Motion on one. Ready!

1322
01:30:28,580 --> 01:30:29,540
来吧
Break!

1323
01:30:29,740 --> 01:30:32,340
现在是布鲁西时刻
Yeah. It's Brucie's time to shine, baby.

1324
01:30:32,910 --> 01:30:35,400
来吧,进攻
Okay. Down, set. Hut!

1325
01:30:35,620 --> 01:30:39,520
又一次失球 但是狱警们很快扑了上去
There's the snap and the ball is fumbled. And the guards recover.

1326
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:41,410
我不该吃那些爆米花
I knew I shouldn't have had that popcorn.

1327
01:30:42,590 --> 01:30:46,360
现在狱警们在场上占主导地位
The guards are in command here as we move late into the third quarter.

1328
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:47,930
来吧九十八
Ninety-eight. 一！二！
一！
Hut! Hut!

1329
01:30:48,930 --> 01:30:51,960
球传给了鲍特 又回传给科纳瓦
The give is to Potter. Back to Knauer.

1330
01:30:52,170 --> 01:30:54,430
他在前场的到一个优势进攻位置
He's got a man open deep downfield.

1331
01:30:54,630 --> 01:30:56,570
一个交替传球
He'll throw the flea-flicker!

1332
01:30:56,770 --> 01:30:59,430
接得很准,得分 狱警队
And he's got it. Touchdown, guards.

1333
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:02,700
看起来比分开始失控了
And this game is starting to look like a blowout.

1334
01:31:04,780 --> 01:31:08,870
这就是你对 凯尔泰克的回报？
Hey, man, after all Caretaker did, this is how you show him love?

1335
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:10,450
别担心
Don't worry about it.

1336
01:31:10,650 --> 01:31:12,910
你一点也没变
You haven't changed one damn bit.

1337
01:31:17,390 --> 01:31:19,120
好了,来吧！
All right. Down, set!

1338
01:31:19,330 --> 01:31:20,550
布鲁西继续担任四分卫
Back in at quarterback is Brucie,

1339
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:23,590
看看这次会把球传给谁
who will try to find a handle on the ball this time.

1340
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:26,030
扔出去,布鲁西
Throw it, Brucie!

1341
01:31:26,570 --> 01:31:28,030
真糟
Oh, shit!

1342
01:31:28,370 --> 01:31:29,770
留神看
And look out.

1343
01:31:33,810 --> 01:31:35,870
重重一击！
What a shot he took!

1344
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:37,540
你还要我们损失多少？
How much more blood do you want?

1345
01:31:40,710 --> 01:31:44,410
我觉得囚犯队选错了四分卫
I think the cons are just about out of options at quarterback.

1346
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,930
斯基奇 我有个问题要问你
Hey, Skitchy, let me ask you something.

1347
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:09,740
你打了典狱长,你觉得值吗？
When you popped the warden, was it worth it?

1348
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:12,070
值得把你后半身都搭在监狱吗？
Was it worth spending the rest of your life in here?

1349
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:16,610
当然值,每一秒都值得
Was it worth it? It was worth every goddamn second.

1350
01:32:24,590 --> 01:32:26,390
他想怎么样？
What the hell is he doing?

1351
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:32,930
保罗克鲁应该感觉好多了 因为他又上场
Paul Crewe must be feeling better, because here he comes.

1352
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:35,500
好了我想你们 所以我上场了
All right, I missed you guys, so I'm back.

1353
01:32:35,700 --> 01:32:37,970
我想我们要做很多才能赶上
We got a lot of work to do. Let's get it going.

1354
01:32:38,170 --> 01:32:40,770
89码处来个袭击,行吗？
Deuce right, 89. Fly on two. Ready?

1355
01:32:43,110 --> 01:32:44,170
很好！
Break.

1356
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:48,770
第四轮进攻囚犯队已经落后 3个六分球
As we start the fourth quarter, cons down by three touchdowns.

1357
01:32:48,970 --> 01:32:50,260
左边注意
Wide left! Tight left!

1358
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:54,040
直捣90码！
Black 90. 一！二！
一！
Hut! Hut!

1359
01:32:54,250 --> 01:32:56,810
又一个闪电战！
Here comes the blitz, and no one's blocking!

1360
01:32:57,020 --> 01:33:00,020
克鲁被困在其中
And Crewe will be sacked for a big loss.

1361
01:33:00,690 --> 01:33:04,720
看上去又是克鲁进攻的信息
That looked like a message to Crewe from his offensive line.

1362
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:08,130
你们看到了 有个空当
Did you see that, man? They're quitting on him.

1363
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:10,330
来吧！还是闪电战术
Okay, baby. Jailbreak Blitz. Ready?

1364
01:33:10,670 --> 01:33:12,800
这是我应得的
We got that out of the way. I deserved it.

1365
01:33:13,010 --> 01:33:15,370
- 让他们知道什么是橄榄球 - 换位
- Now we gotta play some football. - Switch it! Switch it!

1366
01:33:15,580 --> 01:33:17,670
囚犯队得很努力才能 改变劣势
Cons need to do something to get back in this game.

1367
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:19,710
可不是这样
And that's not it!

1368
01:33:20,510 --> 01:33:22,500
克鲁已经被瞄准
And Crewe is leveled!

1369
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:25,010
我觉得他可能爬不起来了
I don't think he's gonna get up from that one.

1370
01:33:25,220 --> 01:33:26,690
不错的撞击
Nice hit!

1371
01:33:28,590 --> 01:33:31,180
但是他还是爬了起来 真不知道他是怎么做到的
But he is. And I don't know how, after that last hit.

1372
01:33:31,390 --> 01:33:32,520
来次弃踢吧
All right, punt team!

1373
01:33:32,730 --> 01:33:35,090
让他们比较远的地方开始 没问题吧
Keep them off the field! We're going for it.

1374
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:37,160
傻蛋菜会这么做 行动起来
Dumbshits are going for it! Let's go! Let's go!

1375
01:33:37,530 --> 01:33:40,470
回来吧,如果他想挨打
Come on back, if he wants to get his ass kicked. Come on back.

1376
01:33:40,670 --> 01:33:41,930
简直太不可思议了
This is unbelievable.

1377
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:46,300
你们要是不想和我合作 我就自己来
Fine. You guys don't wanna help me, I'll do it on my own. On two.

1378
01:33:47,310 --> 01:33:48,540
去界限上
Let's go, to the line.

1379
01:33:48,740 --> 01:33:50,070
在20码线上
On fourth and 20,

1380
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:53,070
囚犯队决定做一次努力 这才像是正式比赛
the cons are gonna go for it. This could be the ball game right here.

1381
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,340
红队98注意
Red 98. 一！二！
一！
Hut! Hut!

1382
01:33:56,950 --> 01:34:00,650
克鲁劈开了闪电战术 但是掉了他的头盔
Crewe dodges the blitz, but he loses his helmet.

1383
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:05,650
他继续前进
And he's not going down.

1384
01:34:11,260 --> 01:34:13,530
不错的战果
He's got the first down.

1385
01:34:13,730 --> 01:34:14,960
暂停
Time-out!

1386
01:34:15,670 --> 01:34:17,330
- 这才是男人 - 不错啊
- Man, oh, man. - Not bad.

1387
01:34:24,910 --> 01:34:26,140
集合
Huddle up.

1388
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:28,240
听着
Look.

1389
01:34:29,350 --> 01:34:32,810
我知道你们都猜到了 但是我还是要大声说出来
I'm sure you already know this, but I never said it out loud.

1390
01:34:34,290 --> 01:34:36,050
我放弃这次比赛了
I did throw that game.

1391
01:34:37,490 --> 01:34:38,790
刚才是这样
I did it.

1392
01:34:39,630 --> 01:34:42,460
我被坏人威胁
I was in a bad way with some worse people.

1393
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:44,630
我这样做的时候
After I did it,

1394
01:34:44,830 --> 01:34:48,860
我感觉糟透了 我觉得不如让人杀了我算了
I felt so shitty I wish I would have just let them kill me instead.

1395
01:34:49,540 --> 01:34:53,910
典狱长会要挟要我将 如果我不放弃这次比赛
Now the warden wants to pin Caretaker's murder on me

1396
01:34:54,110 --> 01:34:56,040
他要将谋杀凯尔泰克 的罪责加于我
if I don't throw this game.

1397
01:34:57,880 --> 01:35:00,350
看起来我们还可以相处更长时间
So it looks like I'm gonna get to know you guys a lot better,

1398
01:35:00,550 --> 01:35:03,180
因为我不会两次犯同一错误
because I ain't doing that twice in a lifetime.

1399
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:06,580
时间所剩不多 但是我们还可以挽回局面
We got a little time left. We can still do this.

1400
01:35:06,790 --> 01:35:09,880
我请求你们 把手放在这里
I'm begging you. Put your hands in here.

1401
01:35:19,630 --> 01:35:22,690
谢谢你们 我们是谁？
Okay. Thank you. Now, who are we?

1402
01:35:22,900 --> 01:35:23,930
邪恶战车
Mean Machine!

1403
01:35:24,140 --> 01:35:26,500
来吧！邪恶战车！
Come on, Mean Machine, let's go!

1404
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:28,500
很高兴你归队了
I'm glad you got back.

1405
01:35:28,510 --> 01:35:29,510
这样不用我宰了你了
It doesn't use me to kill you.

1406
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:31,110
真是个好消息
That's great news.

1407
01:35:31,310 --> 01:35:34,080
这次有赛的了
All right. We got ourselves a game.

1408
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:35,870
棕色65
Brown 65. Hut!

1409
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:40,140
第一次从10码到30码 克鲁找到迪肯德空当
First and 10 from the 30. Crewe finds Deacon open in the flat.

1410
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:43,210
一！
Hut!

1411
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:47,790
传球给麦吉特 他又使战线向前推进了9码
The give is to Megget. And he fights his way for a 9-yard gain.

1412
01:35:47,990 --> 01:35:49,690
一码,再来一码
One yard, baby. One more yard.

1413
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:52,110
一！二！
一！二！
一！
Hut! Hut!

1414
01:35:52,330 --> 01:35:54,320
看克鲁在耍什么小把戏
Crewe tries a sneak. Or is it?

1415
01:35:54,530 --> 01:35:56,000
他把球传给麦吉特
He flips it back to Megget.

1416
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:59,530
麦吉特又在继续推进战线
Megget's got the first down and more.

1417
01:36:06,910 --> 01:36:10,870
麦吉特这次前进了4码 得分在望
And Megget is down to the 4-yard line, where it'll be first and goal.

1418
01:36:11,070 --> 01:36:12,160
一！
Hut!

1419
01:36:13,220 --> 01:36:16,850
克鲁传球给特里 看这大家伙怎么做
Crewe hands it to Turley. And look at the big man go.

1420
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:18,280
抱擒阻止他
T ackle him!

1421
01:36:24,030 --> 01:36:25,090
得分！
Touchdown!

1422
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:30,430
这里有不少兵乓声
That was some rumbling, bumbling stumbling right there.

1423
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:32,400
听听人群的欢呼吧
And listen to the crowd

1424
01:36:32,610 --> 01:36:36,270
观众们也开始喜欢囚犯队
as this underdog con team is starting to win them over.

1425
01:36:44,350 --> 01:36:47,950
现在狱警队在29码线上持球
Third down and 6. Guards have the ball on their own 29-yard line.

1426
01:36:48,150 --> 01:36:50,620
科纳瓦需要一击获胜
Knauer needs a first down to put this game away.

1427
01:36:50,820 --> 01:36:52,290
白队50
White 50!

1428
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:53,950
白队50
White 50!

1429
01:36:54,160 --> 01:36:56,320
看看赛场上发生了什么
And look at Battle take off.

1430
01:36:57,730 --> 01:36:59,200
他把球打飞了
He knocks the ball loose!

1431
01:37:00,470 --> 01:37:05,030
这可真是成堆了 裁判员都有点糊涂了
There's a dogpile in the backfield. The refs are trying to sort it out.

1432
01:37:07,740 --> 01:37:09,370
我的胳膊！
My arm!

1433
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:12,340
囚犯队重夺进攻权
The cons recover!

1434
01:37:12,980 --> 01:37:15,810
我们抢到了球
We got the ball! We got the ball! We got it! We got it!

1435
01:37:16,620 --> 01:37:21,050
剩下的这两分多钟 好像才真正进入比赛
With just over two minutes left to be played, this has turned into a game.

1436
01:37:21,420 --> 01:37:25,150
克鲁在25码处开始新的进攻
Crewe will start in great field position at the guards' 25.

1437
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:28,950
看场上的形势 狱警们好像很困惑
And look at this formation. The guards, they're confused.

1438
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:30,220
快移过去
Shift over! Move!

1439
01:37:30,430 --> 01:37:32,690
他们想叫暂停 但是来不及了
They're trying to call time-out, but there's the snap.

1440
01:37:36,570 --> 01:37:40,100
莫斯被抛在人墙之后 我可不想被这样的墙撞上
Moss is behind a wall of cons. I wouldn't wanna be in front of that thing.

1441
01:37:43,340 --> 01:37:44,740
他们要得分了
And they'll score!

1442
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:52,510
- 这样合法吗？ - 是的
- Hey! Is that legal? - Yeah, it is.

1443
01:37:52,720 --> 01:37:54,550
- 这样得分了？ - 是的
- Is that a touchdown? - Yes, it is.

1444
01:37:54,750 --> 01:37:57,620
到底怎么回事？
What is going on here? Shit!

1445
01:37:58,120 --> 01:38:01,320
加上额外的加分 囚犯队只落后7分
And with the extra point, the cons are down by just seven.

1446
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,100
- 布鲁西 - 在这呢,教练
- Brucie! - Yeah. Yeah, coach.

1447
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:13,660
沃要你去中线开球
I want you to go out there and kick off.

1448
01:38:13,870 --> 01:38:15,770
- 没问题 - 开球
- I can do it. - Kick off!

1449
01:38:16,210 --> 01:38:18,010
他跟本就开不好
Brucie can't kick worth a shit.

1450
01:38:18,210 --> 01:38:21,010
我知道,去夺球
I know. Recover the ball.

1451
01:38:21,410 --> 01:38:24,280
耶稣基督,我的救世主 如果你助我一臂之力
Jesus Christ, my savior. If you help me out with this one,

1452
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:27,980
我保证不再和那个黑人做 对不起我老婆的事了,阿门
I promise to stop cheating on my wife with black guys. Amen.

1453
01:38:28,190 --> 01:38:30,350
重返赛场的布鲁西 对这次机会格外珍惜
Back in the game is Brucie, and he'll do the honors.

1454
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:32,150
开球开的太糟糕了
And it's a horrible kick.

1455
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:33,850
但是球还是跌撞着出去了
But the ball is tipped!

1456
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:37,290
而且囚犯队持球
And the cons have come up with it!

1457
01:38:38,530 --> 01:38:41,000
真不错,来一次暂停
- We got it! One time-out. - Got it. Got it.

1458
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:44,640
这才是布鲁西 乖乖!
That's it, Brucie. Hey, hey! My bad. My bad. My bad. Come on.

1459
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:47,530
给我
Give me that.

1460
01:38:48,510 --> 01:38:49,570
真见鬼
Damn--

1461
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:53,340
没必要这样吧
Well, that felt unnecessary.

1462
01:38:53,550 --> 01:38:56,310
囚犯队还有足够的时间 扭转局势
Cons have enough time for one final drive.

1463
01:38:57,420 --> 01:38:59,720
克鲁在压力下后传
Crewe drops back to pass. He's under pressure.

1464
01:38:59,950 --> 01:39:02,550
- 盯住 - 他在找迪肯
- Watch the pass! - He's looking for Deacon.

1465
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:04,480
他接住了球 但是被防守队员擒抱
He gets the ball up, but he's leveled.

1466
01:39:05,490 --> 01:39:08,290
第一次进攻结束 还处在发边线球
And Deacon's got it for a first down, but he stayed inbounds.

1467
01:39:08,490 --> 01:39:10,430
时间不挺的流逝
Tick, tick, tick. The clock keeps running.

1468
01:39:10,630 --> 01:39:13,620
还有时间！还有时间！
Clock's running. Clock's still running! Clock's still running!

1469
01:39:13,830 --> 01:39:14,820
留心！
On the ball!

1470
01:39:15,030 --> 01:39:17,030
真见鬼！快做点什么！
Goddamn it! Do something!

1471
01:39:17,230 --> 01:39:18,250
Hut!

1472
01:39:19,110 --> 01:39:22,300
这次克鲁想要掷球了
Crewe. He's looking to throw. Under pressure again.

1473
01:39:22,510 --> 01:39:24,980
快！加油！
Go! Get rid of it! Go! Go!

1474
01:39:25,180 --> 01:39:27,370
他把球传给麦吉特 他还有机会
He pitches it to Megget. He's got some room.

1475
01:39:27,580 --> 01:39:30,210
麦吉加油！
Here we go. Here we go. Go, Megg! Go, Megget!

1476
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:33,240
加油！麦吉特
- Go, Megget! - Get him!

1477
01:39:33,450 --> 01:39:35,850
没人可以拦住他
He could go all the way!

1478
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:37,280
但是……
But he won't!

1479
01:39:37,490 --> 01:39:38,580
真见鬼
Goddamn it!

1480
01:39:38,790 --> 01:39:41,230
麦吉特在4码处受到严重撞击 他受伤了
And Megget is hit hard at the 4, and he's hurt.

1481
01:39:41,430 --> 01:39:42,790
我的膝盖,天啊
My knee, man!

1482
01:39:45,130 --> 01:39:47,960
我们需要你的膝盖 都指望你了
You busted your knee for us, we'll bust our ass for you.

1483
01:39:48,170 --> 01:39:49,960
教练,我们要个替补
Hey, coach, I need a back!

1484
01:39:50,170 --> 01:39:51,470
一定要赢！
Just win this shit.

1485
01:39:53,510 --> 01:39:54,840
我去
I'm going in.

1486
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:56,630
真的吗？教练
Coach, you serious?

1487
01:39:56,840 --> 01:39:58,400
当然
Yeah, I'm serious.

1488
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:01,170
看看谁上场了
And look who's coming into the game.

1489
01:40:01,780 --> 01:40:03,480
你能做到
You can do it!

1490
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:06,880
老家伙！你能笑到最后
Get that old ass of yours in the end zone!

1491
01:40:07,090 --> 01:40:09,580
我们会赢得比赛
We gotta win this thing! Come on!

1492
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:14,120
等等,老头
No, no, no. Hey, old man.

1493
01:40:14,330 --> 01:40:16,320
绝对不行 你会把自己的命赔到这
Absolutely not. You're gonna get killed out here.

1494
01:40:16,530 --> 01:40:19,500
他们都跃跃欲试了 别担心,我会打好比赛
They've been trying that for years. Don't worry, I got the perfect play.

1495
01:40:19,700 --> 01:40:21,930
- 我不会把球给你的 - 看情况吧
- I ain't handing you the ball. - You don't have to.

1496
01:40:22,140 --> 01:40:25,570
内特·斯卡波罗 1955年海斯曼奖杯获得者
Nate Scarborough, the former Heisman Trophy winner from 1955,

1497
01:40:25,770 --> 01:40:26,970
上场打后卫
is gonna play tailback,

1498
01:40:27,170 --> 01:40:29,730
不过他上场主要也只能提供 精神上的支持
but he's gotta be in there more for moral support than anything.

1499
01:40:29,940 --> 01:40:32,740
邪恶战车！邪恶战车
Mean Machine. Mean Machine.

1500
01:40:32,950 --> 01:40:35,710
邪恶战车！邪恶战车
Mean Machine. Mean Machine.

1501
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:40,250
邪恶战车！邪恶战车
Mean Machine, Mean Machine Mean Machine

1502
01:40:40,450 --> 01:40:41,820
邪恶战车！邪恶战车
Mean Machine!

1503
01:40:42,020 --> 01:40:43,110
邪恶战车！邪恶战车
Mean Machine!

1504
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:46,820
比赛还有6秒钟结束 比分落后7分
Six seconds left on the clock. Cons down by seven.

1505
01:40:47,030 --> 01:40:49,020
这一举必须得分
They must score on this play.

1506
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:52,760
被让他们得逞！
Don't let them through!

1507
01:40:54,770 --> 01:40:56,130
进攻！就位
Down, set!

1508
01:40:56,670 --> 01:40:59,300
黑色99码！
- Black 99! - Come on, D!

1509
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:02,470
Black 99! 一！二！
一！
Hut! Hut!

1510
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:04,870
球给了大块头特里
The give is to the big man, Turley.

1511
01:41:05,410 --> 01:41:08,870
他被兰伯特拦截了
He's stopped by Lambert at the line for no gain.

1512
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:11,110
太不可思议
No! Wait!

1513
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:14,880
斯卡波罗捡到了球
The ball's picked up by Scarborough.

1514
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:19,380
来吧
Come on!

1515
01:41:24,830 --> 01:41:26,560
得分
Touchdown!

1516
01:41:35,140 --> 01:41:36,970
真是精彩的一幕
What an amazing comeback, folks!

1517
01:41:37,180 --> 01:41:39,800
这将载入内布拉斯加州的 比赛史册
Taking a play from the old Nebraska playbook.

1518
01:41:40,010 --> 01:41:41,000
这一行动
The Fumblerooskie.

1519
01:41:41,210 --> 01:41:42,810
放松
Easy. Easy.

1520
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:44,480
你还好吗？老头
You still alive, old man?

1521
01:41:46,020 --> 01:41:47,540
这辈子感觉从没这么好过
Never felt better in my life.

1522
01:41:47,750 --> 01:41:49,880
你这个变态,起来吧
You're a sick bastard. Come here.

1523
01:41:50,620 --> 01:41:52,140
All right.

1524
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:56,590
现在囚犯队可以凭借额外的加分 不用进入加时赛
And now the cons are a mere extra point away from overtime.

1525
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:58,230
邪恶战车
Mean Machine!

1526
01:42:01,730 --> 01:42:05,100
投票决定：我们继续打赢比赛 还是打个平手就够了？
Team vote: We go for the win? We go for the tie?

1527
01:42:05,300 --> 01:42:08,670
我们是罪犯 我们当然义无反顾
Hell, guys, we're convicts. We always go for it all.

1528
01:42:09,210 --> 01:42:13,010
不幸的是,这也是 为什么我们呆在监狱的原因
Unfortunately, that's why we're all in the joint.

1529
01:42:13,450 --> 01:42:14,670
凯尔泰克会怎么样？
What would Caretaker do?

1530
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:17,780
把那黑板给我
Give me that blackboard.

1531
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:19,180
来吧！
Yeah, come on!

1532
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:20,890
来吧！
Come on.

1533
01:42:23,420 --> 01:42:24,580
你是认真的？
Are you serious?

1534
01:42:24,790 --> 01:42:26,450
我不知道,这样打有点怪
I don't know. That play is wack.

1535
01:42:26,660 --> 01:42:27,720
绝对管用
It's gonna work.

1536
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,190
会管用,来吧,上场
It's gonna work. Let's go. On the ball.

1537
01:42:31,390 --> 01:42:32,380
Come on! Let's go!

1538
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:34,590
来吧大家上场
Let's go, y'all! Let's go!

1539
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:36,430
我觉得没问题
I think it's gonna work.

1540
01:42:37,530 --> 01:42:39,260
Get them out there.

1541
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:44,900
几分钟的休息之后 克鲁回到赛场
And wait a minute. Crewe is coming back into the game.

1542
01:42:45,110 --> 01:42:46,910
囚犯队会赢得比赛
The cons are gonna go for the win.

1543
01:42:47,110 --> 01:42:48,170
他们义无反顾
They're going for it.

1544
01:42:49,450 --> 01:42:52,540
克鲁在组织进攻
Crewe, trying to settle his team into formation.

1545
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:54,650
但是看上去有点小问题
But there seems to be a lot of confusion.

1546
01:42:54,850 --> 01:42:56,550
来吧,快开始
Come on! Run the play!

1547
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:59,090
特里,站在那边
Turley! Turley. Over here.

1548
01:42:59,290 --> 01:43:01,890
你站在这里,就这
Move your giant ass right here! Right here.

1549
01:43:02,090 --> 01:43:03,890
来吧！宝贝！
Come on, baby. Come on.

1550
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:08,530
比赛正在计时 克鲁最好叫下暂停
The play clock is still running. Crewe better call a time-out.

1551
01:43:08,730 --> 01:43:09,700
来吧,克鲁
Come on, Crewe!

1552
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:13,540
他们不知道我们在干什么
They don't know what we're doing!

1553
01:43:13,740 --> 01:43:15,300
就照我们计划的去做
Run the play we set up.

1554
01:43:15,510 --> 01:43:17,770
我觉得你刚才摔糊涂还没清醒！
I think you're still dizzy from that hit!

1555
01:43:18,780 --> 01:43:20,750
球快速传给迪肯
The snap is to Deacon.

You got a lot of balls, Crewe. You played a hell of a game.

下一步我们做什么？
Yeah? Okay. So, what do we do now?

1594
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:21,990
首先,我们要告诉大家 怎么狂扁昂格尔
Well, the first thing is, we tell the team where they're hiding Unger.

1595
01:46:22,190 --> 01:46:25,630
我等不及看斯韦托斯基怎么揍他了
