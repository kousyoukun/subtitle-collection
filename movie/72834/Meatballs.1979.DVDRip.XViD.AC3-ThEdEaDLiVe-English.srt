00:00:56,923 --> 00:01:00,689
<i>Attention, Camp North Star,</i>

2
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:05,890
<i>senior staff, counselors,</i>
<i>and counselors in training,</i>

3
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,337
<i>please rise for our national anthem.</i>

4
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:47,740
<i>How about that anthem, huh?</i>
<i>Gee, I don't know about you,</i>

5
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:52,072
<i>but I just get a great big</i>
<i>lump in my throat every time I hear it.</i>

6
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:55,839
<i>Well, it's 7:05 in the a.m.,</i>

7
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,908
<i>and it's, wow, 43 degrees</i>

8
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:02,144
<i>on the old Camp North Star</i>
<i>weather dial,</i>

9
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:07,215
<i>and, well, that is kind of nippy</i>
<i>for a June 25, isn't it?</i>

10
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,420
<i>I'm Tripper Harrison...</i>

11
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:15,189
<i>I'm your head counselor,</i>
<i>and this is my wake-up show.</i>

12
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:18,537
<i>I'll be coming at you every morning</i>
<i>about this time,</i>

13
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,970
<i>hoping to make</i>
<i>your summer camp experience</i>

14
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:24,942
<i>the best available in this price range.</i>

15
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:30,246
<i>'Course, across the lake,</i>
<i>over at Camp Mohawk,</i>

16
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:34,978
<i>they won't be getting up</i>
<i>for another hour or so,</i>

17
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,918
<i>and when they do,</i>
<i>they'll be awakened by servants</i>

18
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:39,617
<i>bearing croissants and café au lait.</i>

19
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,154
<i>Hope I didn't hit anybody.</i>

20
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,922
<i>But over here,</i>
<i>at Camp North Star this morning,</i>

21
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,555
<i>we're gonna be having</i>
<i>a delicious gruel breakfast,</i>

22
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:51,899
<i>and don't forget to ask for seconds,</i>
<i>because it's all the gruel you can eat.</i>

23
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,980
Okay, everybody.
Can I have your attention, please?

24
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:15,183
Okay, everybody, <i>I'm</i> waiting.
People, settle down.

25
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,186
Okay. <i>That's</i> better.

26
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,265
Look it, <i>there's</i> a lot of new people
out there this year,

27
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,926
so before we go any further,
I wanna introduce myself.

28
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,366
My <i>name's</i> Morty Melnick.

29
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,404
- Hi, Mickey.
- Hi, Mickey.

30
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:34,733
My <i>name's</i> Morty, not Mickey.

31
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,599
Now, the buses are leaving
tomorrow morning at 6:30

32
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,802
to pick up the kids,

33
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:40,936
and <i>it's</i> very important
you get your bus assignments

34
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,537
to know which group of
kids you're in charge of.

35
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,787
<i>Don't</i> argue with me, Bradley.

36
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:54,382
Now, you can get rabies
from a raccoon, too.

37
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,155
- Tell him, Morrie.
- <i>That's</i> right, Bradley.

38
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,890
And <i>don't</i> forget to put paper
on the toilet seat cover,

39
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,158
<i>'cause you could get
a terrible infection...

40
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,734
Oh, you know what I meant to ask you,
did you bring smokes?

41
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,769
Oh, no, I couldn't. I forgot.

42
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:08,032
My mom found the carton
in my suitcase, she had a shit-fit.

43
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,041
- Well, why <i>don't</i> we go get some?
- Yeah, okay.

44
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,977
Mommy? Mommy?
<i>Where's</i> my mommy?

45
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:17,779
Tripper, <i>I'm</i> looking forward
to some action this summer,

46
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,181
I hope you and your gentlemen
can supply it for me.

47
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:24,052
Well, I could supply you, but the guy
you gotta watch out for is Spaz.

48
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,421
- Spaz?
- <i>He's</i> a sex machine.

49
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,557
Are you kidding me?

50
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,096
He <i>couldn't</i> wake me up
with a trumpet and a drum.

51
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:36,567
Well, I went out with him one night,
and he got us six nurses by himself,

52
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:40,332
and four of them
<i>couldn't</i> report to work the next morning.

53
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,440
You gonna be okay?

54
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:50,279
Hey, I'll see you
at the end of the summer, okay?

55
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:51,909
Okay.

56
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,793
This bus does not have
a safety inspection sticker.

57
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:07,058
<i>It's</i> a fine old bus.

58
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:10,966
No, <i>it's</i> not. It is a piece of junk.
I need to tell my father,

59
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,732
and <i>he's</i> gonna report you
to the Department of Motor Vehicles.

60
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,864
Roxanne!

61
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:18,602
And you're going to jail. You know?
Jail? Behind bars?

62
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,938
Yeah, just like last year, we'll hate it.

63
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,277
Yeah. Camp is lousy, and you're a dork.

64
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,511
Yeah, yeah, you're right,
you sure are one.

65
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,181
- Hiya.
- Come on.

66
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:29,413
- Hi.
- What do you want?

67
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,514
- What, are you having trouble?
- I <i>can't</i> get these kids on the bus.

68
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,616
- Okay. Let me talk to them.
- <i>That's</i> because <i>I'm</i> not going.

69
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,592
Come here, guys,
I wanna have a word with you, all right?

70
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:37,754
No.

71
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,559
- Okay, now you guys, look, you...
- What?

72
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:40,927
- You better get on the bus, or...
- Why?

73
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:45,129
Well, because if you don't,
<i>I'm</i> gonna beat the pants off of you.

74
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:46,938
Not bad, huh?

75
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:06,351
- Hey, watch it, that <i>stuff's</i> expensive.
- Very good, sir.

76
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,891
Hey, Spaz, bud. How you doing, buddy?

77
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,160
Hey, Spaz, good to see you.

78
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,394
Oh, hey, give that back.

79
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,129
Come on, Spaz.
No, we're doing you a favor.

80
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:21,001
- Give it back!
- You wanna make us, Spaz?

81
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,571
- Yeah.
- Horse, give him back the milkshake.

82
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:29,306
All right, all right. Here you go.

83
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:37,985
Hey, we'll see you
at the basketball game, Spaz.

84
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,360
Mohawk jerks.

85
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,889
These children are going to the
most glamorous of all summer camps,

86
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,158
Camp Mohawk.

87
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:51,930
<i>There's</i> a two-year waiting list,
and every child has to be voted in.

88
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:55,906
On top of all that, it costs $1,000 a week
to go to Camp Mohawk.

89
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:59,011
The question is,
is it worth $1,000 a week?

90
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:02,171
It sure is.
<i>It's</i> the best darn camp there is.

91
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,473
Well, are you connected
with Camp Mohawk?

92
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:07,485
Well, I think so, <i>I'm</i> the
program director, Jerry Aldini.

93
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,953
Well, how do you justify $1,000 a week?

94
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:12,057
Well, we have some
special programs.

95
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,626
We're doing Shakespeare in the Round
again this year, of course.

96
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:17,560
Our political round table.
Henry Kissinger will appear.

97
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,130
Yasser Arafat is gonna come out,

98
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,995
spend a weekend with the kids,
just rap with them.

99
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,158
<i>That's</i> amazing.

100
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,292
And the kids wanted animals,

101
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:26,701
so this year, each camper
will stalk and kill his own bear

102
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,364
in our private wildlife preserve.

103
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,908
Are you sure the children can hack that?

104
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,240
We'll see.
But the real excitement, of course,

105
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,041
is gonna come
at the end of the summer,

106
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:36,409
during Sexual Awareness Week.

107
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,347
We import 200 hookers
from around the world,

108
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:43,218
and each camper, armed with only
a Thermos of coffee and $2,000 cash,

109
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:46,155
tries to visit as many countries
as he can, and the winner, of course,

110
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,022
is named
King of Sexual Awareness Week,

111
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,563
and is allowed to rape and pillage the
neighboring towns until camp ends.

112
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:52,756
<i>That's</i> incredible.

113
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,856
What do you expect for $1,000 a week?

114
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,594
Hey, you have
a good summer, too, huh?

115
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:39,872
Hey. You must be the short,
depressed kid that we ordered.

116
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:41,673
Glad you made it.

117
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,145
Want half this?

118
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,486
Come on inside, Frankenstein,
I'll buy you a cocktail.

119
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,257
Okay, all the 12-year-old
girls here finally?

120
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,855
Gonna be a terrific year.
Got a real good bunch this year.

121
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:06,061
This ground is too slippery. I could fall
and get whiplash or a broken neck.

122
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,070
You know, those are serious injuries.
A guy could die...

123
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:11,575
- Phil? <i>He's</i> all yours.
- Thanks, Tripper. You Rudy Gerner?

124
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,679
Hi, <i>I'm</i> Phil. You're in my cabin, okay?

125
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,474
- Gotta get this...
- Hi, Morty.

126
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:17,515
- Hi, Trip. You got the rules?
- No, <i>I'm</i> looking for a copy.

127
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,380
Okay, here you go.

128
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,351
Very important, all your CITs

129
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,184
have gotta know those inside out,
backwards, forward, whatever you want.

130
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,316
Post them up, make sure
they know them. Very important.

131
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,328
Hey, Larry.

132
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,597
- Larry!
- What?

133
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,934
I think that chick over there
is staring at me.

134
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,404
- Which chick? Where?
- Over there.

135
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,270
Hey, she is staring at you.

136
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:49,278
You better go over and talk to her.
She probably wants it.

137
00:10:57,256 --> 00:11:00,555
- <i>What's</i> cooking, good looking?
- Your <i>fly's</i> undone.

138
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:11,126
Renzetti, come here.
Hey, Fink, come on. Off your knees.

139
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,265
Hey, Spaz, I was watching you.

140
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,840
Looked like you had a chance there
for a second.

141
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,408
Thanks, Trip.

142
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:20,905
- My man, my main man.
- Hey, Tripper.

143
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,914
- Hey, boy.
- Eyes right, gentlemen.

144
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,881
- Hey.
- Hey, are these free?

145
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:28,886
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi. Hi, Mary.

146
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:32,389
- Fine. Just right, left, right, left.
- Jeez, <i>that's</i> right.

147
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:36,757
All right, these are the camp rules.

148
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,353
Morty would like you all
to take a look at these.

149
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,093
They'll be in here, if you
wanna check these out a little bit later.

150
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,465
And now, gentlemen, and you are,

151
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:46,935
<i>I'm</i> gonna take you over to your
cabin assignments for the first week.

152
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:47,471
<i>Let's</i> go.

153
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:51,432
All right, this is the six-year-old cabin.

154
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,411
All they know how to do is eat
and wet their beds.

155
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:57,414
You have to teach them everything else.
Crockett, take it.

156
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,347
No, no, Trip. I <i>don't</i> want it.
No six-year-olds.

157
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,079
Oh, come on, Trip,
I <i>don't</i> wanna...

158
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:02,518
<i>That's</i> my man. Good luck.

159
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:06,124
Put the comic book away,
and get your shirt.

160
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:12,255
Take the shirt by the shoulders.
One, fold sleevie. Two, fold sleevie.

161
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,632
- Presto. <i>It's</i> done.
- <i>How's</i> this?

162
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,031
- <i>How's</i> this, Mike?
- <i>That's</i> not bad.

163
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,363
Listen, why <i>don't</i> we just have a nap,

164
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,267
and we'll come back later
and try it, okay?

165
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:20,531
- No, forget it.
- No.

166
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,607
Come on, guys.
Do I have to count to three?

167
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:26,371
One, two... <i>Two's</i> good enough.

168
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,103
Come on, Steve.

169
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,681
Hey, <i>what's</i> that?

170
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,551
<i>It's</i> Ernie, my pet frog. <i>He's</i> a jumper.

171
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,129
- How come he <i>doesn't</i> hop?
- <i>He's</i> tired, I guess.

172
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,358
- No, <i>he's</i> dead.
- No, <i>he's</i> sleeping.

173
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,297
For sure, <i>he's</i> dead.

174
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,869
Mister, could you help me
wake up my frog?

175
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:58,438
He looks tired. Why <i>don't</i> we just
let him sleep a little longer, okay?

176
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,636
- Yeah.
- Okay.

177
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:04,079
Take that nap now, all right? And I'II...
I'll take care of the frog.

178
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,746
All right,
this is the 14-year-old <i>girls'</i> cabin.

179
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,150
They've got the drive
and the equipment,

180
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,984
- but they <i>don't</i> have the experience.
- Right.

181
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,321
<i>They'd</i> better not get it from you guys.
Not this summer, anyway, huh?

182
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:18,192
Roxanne.
Just the person I wanted to see.

183
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,762
Later, Tripper. Say, Christmas?

184
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:25,767
A.L., <i>that's</i> your cabin.
You got the jailbait. Watch them.

185
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,770
- Women.
- Thanks.

186
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,634
See you later.

187
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,836
Roxanne, I want you to know
that <i>I'm</i> very deeply hurt,

188
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,378
and I mean that sincerely.

189
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,005
Glad to hear it. Excuse me.

190
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:46,782
Hi, Larry.

191
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,359
Hi, Spaz.

192
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,457
Spaz!

193
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:01,402
Hey, guess what, guys?
Liza finally got her period.

194
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,531
- Liza.
- Liza.

195
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:06,099
- You <i>don't</i> have to advertise it.
- But they gotta know.

196
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:09,214
Hey, Liza you better watch it,
<i>'cause now you can get pregnant.

197
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,646
Yeah, I heard about this girl,

198
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:13,183
and she got pregnant
without doing it with anyone.

199
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:16,152
What do you mean?
You <i>can't</i> get pregnant without doing it.

200
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:19,554
No, stupid.
She <i>didn't</i> do it, she almost did it.

201
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:20,886
My God.

202
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,518
- Hi, guys. I got your cabin this week.
- Hi, A.L.

203
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:24,823
Hey.

204
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:28,422
- Go on. Ask her, ask A.L.
- Ask me what?

205
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,992
A.L., can a girl get pregnant
if she almost does it with a guy?

206
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:35,334
Almost? I <i>don't</i> think so, no.

207
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,435
<i>That's</i> a relief.

208
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,870
Okay, Spazalopolous, you're
in here with Phil and the 12-year-olds.

209
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,040
This here is Rudy.

210
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,946
- Hi, Rudy.
- Hey, Rudy. <i>How's</i> it going?

211
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,451
Gotta watch out for this guy,
<i>he's</i> done time for car theft.

212
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,419
Oh, yeah? My kind of guy there, Rudy.

213
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:53,252
He could be a bad influence
on the other children.

214
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,020
Watch it. We'll see you guys at dinner.

215
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:57,357
- Okay.
- Watch out for the ear, Rudy. Look out!

216
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:58,555
See you later, Spaz.

217
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,359
- Bye-bye, guys.
- Bye, Spaz.

218
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,363
Not bad. Over the head.

219
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,760
Hi, guys. <i>I'm</i> Spaz.

220
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,031
<i>I'm</i> your CIT this week.
I wanna introduce you...

221
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,198
- Hey, look, <i>it's</i> Spaz!
- <i>It's</i> Spaz!

222
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,368
I wanna introduce you to a new guy
in the cabin, that...

223
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,448
Hey, bozo, this is my bunk, so shove off.

224
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:24,485
Settle down. Settle down, okay.
Hey, come on, guys. Settle down.

225
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,888
Okay, <i>let's</i> see, <i>everything's</i> put away.
<i>That's</i> good.

226
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:29,290
Everybody has a bunk. <i>That's</i> good.

227
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,326
<i>Everybody's</i> settled in. <i>That's</i> good.

228
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,297
And <i>everybody's</i> been deloused
and fingerprinted. <i>That's</i> good.

229
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,234
Phil, look, <i>it's</i> the first day of camp,
and we're bored already.

230
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,031
What are we gonna do, huh?

231
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,197
Relax, Peter, relax.

232
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:46,004
Okay, you guys, after lunch
we got a big game with cabin B-11,

233
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,944
and I really wanna win it, okay?
So, what do you say?

234
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,242
- We're gonna kill them!
- We're gonna kill them!

235
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,407
Gonna what?

236
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:52,609
- We're gonna kill them!
- We're gonna kill them!

237
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:53,776
I <i>can't</i> hear you.

238
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,148
- We're gonna kill them!
- We're gonna kill them!

239
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,687
We're gonna kill them!

240
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:00,692
<i>Attention all campers, afternoon</i>
<i>swim schedule is as follows:</i>

241
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,624
<i>Advanced dolphins</i>
<i>will report to the dock</i>

242
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,355
<i>for survival swimming and IQ testing.</i>

243

<i>All senior silverfish,</i>
<i>meet on the beach for nude sunbathing.</i>

<i>Junior salmon, trout and herring,</i>
<i>report to the nearest delicatessen,</i>

<i>and six-year-old tadpoles,</i>
<i>report to the swamp.</i>

<i>And all lobsters, get out of here,</i>
<i>you're a menace!</i>

- Hi, girls.

248
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,695
<i>I'm</i> really looking forward
to working with all of you this summer.

249
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:41,823
I just hope <i>there's</i> enough of me
to go around.

250
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,368
Lance, please. We're eating.

251
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,380
Oh, crap!

252
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,417
Why do I have to
stack the dishes again?

253
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,919
I <i>don't</i> have the energy. <i>I'm</i> weak.
<i>I'm</i> weak from hunger.

254
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,252
Fink. Less flak, more stack.

255
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,155
Gossip! Gossip! We want gossip!

256
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:11,592
Gossip! Gossip! We want gossip!

Gossip! Gossip! We want gossip!

258
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:32,773
Okay. Okay, we have a gossip update.
This is the news.

259
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,685
It seems as though
last <i>summer's</i> hottest couple have split.

260
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:40,314
I <i>can't</i> tell you their names,
but her initials are A.L.,

261
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:43,155
and <i>he's</i> the hottest CIT on wheels.

262
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,130
We all know they spent
most of last summer in the bushes,

263
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,429
but the question is,
will true love bloom again?

264
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:54,131
And speaking of CITs,
<i>there's</i> a certain girl named Wendy

265
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,935
<i>who's</i> giving all the guys wet dreams.

266
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,476
Okay, Jody, thank you very much.

267
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,106
Everybody,
when you're finished stacking,

268
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,844
all the cabins
can go to their other activities.

269
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:14,287
Okay, you guys, <i>let's</i> play ball, okay?
<i>Let's</i> go!

270
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,897
<i>Let's</i> move. We gotta get back
to the cabin for rest period.

271
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:21,830
If <i>I'd</i> wanted to rest,
I would have stayed in Cleveland.

272
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,561
You and Trip are playing defense.
Get your shirts off.

273
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,398
Hey, all right! What do you say?
We're defense, buddy.

274
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:28,234
Okay, you guys. Come on, <i>let's</i> go. We
can win this game, all right. Come on.

275
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,207
Hardware, you're doomed.
Come on, you guys.

276
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:43,146
Come on. Come on, people.
Down here. Come on.

277
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,917
Come on, you guys, <i>let's</i> kill them.

278
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,995
Come on, Rudy,
get it back the other way.

279
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:58,229
Yeah!

280
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,201
Do we have to have
this guy on our team?

281
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,330
Do we gotta have Gerner on our team?
<i>He's</i> totally useless.

282
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:03,965
- He sucks!
- <i>He's</i> terrible.

283
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:07,773
I know, I know. Okay, come on,
you guys. <i>Let's</i> regroup...

284
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:41,807
Yeah, could I have some fries, please?

285
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:52,281
Hey, Gerner. <i>How's</i> it going?

286
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:58,728
This is the best damn food
in the whole Two Pines area.

287
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,889
<i>I'm</i> not surprised you found this place.

288
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:04,435
I had you pegged for a gourmet
first time I met you.

289
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,866
You know, <i>that's</i> a smart move,
bringing a suitcase.

290
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,634
You <i>don't</i> wanna be leaving
a lot of valuable socks

291
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:10,901
and underwear around camp,

292
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:13,773
where people can rustle around in them
when you're out on the town.

293
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,870
Thank you.

294
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,811
You like ketchup?

295
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,675
<i>I'm</i> going away.

296
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:23,345
You going to Vegas?

297
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,115
If you're going to Vegas, man,
I would be up for it,

298
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:29,126
because I love that town.
<i>I'm</i> a party guy, I love that town.

299
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:32,129
I <i>don't</i> think they want me around.

300
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,223
What, are you talking about
the soccer-heads back there?

301
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:39,896
Well, <i>that's</i> life in the fast-paced,
slam-bang, <i>live-on-the-razor's</i> edge,

302
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:43,405
laugh-in-the-face-of-death world
of junior league soccer.

303
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:47,740
<i>I'm</i> serious. I never played
the game before. I tried to tell them.

304
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,648
What? You tried to tell...

305
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:52,714
And they...

306
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:57,550
Who was it? I'll get them.
I'll get them with this Swiss Army knife.

307
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,288
The Swiss trained me to kill,
and I will do it.

308
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:03,486
I will grab these guys by the neck,
take the toothpick,

309
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,654
and stick it right in between their teeth.

310
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,823
And then I'll slap them around the head
a couple of times.

311
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,231
They'll go out for just a couple
of seconds, they'll be unconscious,

312
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:11,962
and while they're doing that,
I'll go for the corkscrew.

313
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,334
And I'll grab them,
and I'll take that corkscrew,

314
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,737
and I will stick it right into the voice box.

315
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:21,074
I will twist that mofo, I will twist it
into his voice box, and rip that thing,

316
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:24,649
rip it out, and he'll talk like this
for the rest of his life.

317
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,481
I <i>don't</i> wanna hurt anyone.
I just want them to like me.

318
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:31,747
Why?

319
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:37,085
If you make one good friend a summer,
then you're doing pretty well.

320
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:47,504
Look, if you have trouble, come to me,
tell me, and I'll help you.

321
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:53,040
<i>What's</i> that? What is that?
Is that yes or no?

322
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:57,013
Yes is like this, and no is just
twisting, twisting, twisting. Okay?

323
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:58,514
- Well, it was yes.
- It was this one?

324
00:21:58,617 --> 00:21:59,777
- Definitely?
- Yes, one of those.

325
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,216
You're positive it <i>wasn't</i>
a side-to-side one?

326
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,480
No, it <i>wasn't</i> one of those.

327
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:05,283
<i>'Cause you could hurt your neck
doing that. Okay...

328
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,359
Have you got wheels?
<i>'Cause I need a lift back to camp.

329
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,224
My folks <i>won't</i> let me drive
<i>'cause they caught me drinking,

330
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,231
they just <i>don't</i> let me out of the house
any more, 'cause <i>I'm</i> a jerk, they said.

331
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,200
They're gonna send me
to military school.

332
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:20,133
You forgot something, Rudy.

333
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,402
Thanks for the fries.

334
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:37,148
Jesus!

335
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,652
- Christ, Hardware.
- You animal. What are you doing?

336
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,420
- I <i>can't</i> handle it.
- You mook, why <i>don't</i> you warn me

337
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,927
when you're gonna play
with your dynamite?

338
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,662
What are you doing, Hardware?

339
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:53,431
<i>I'm</i> hooking up this heavy-duty outlet
here for our new air conditioner.

340
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,938
- An air conditioner? <i>That's</i> great.
- <i>That's</i> right.

341
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,772
- Well, where is it?
- <i>Morty's</i> office. He loves the heat.

342
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,073
Okay.

343
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:07,174
An air conditioner just <i>doesn't</i> get up
and walk away.

344
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:11,312
- Any idea where it might be, Tripper?
- I have no idea.

345
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:15,657
- Maybe it was stolen, Morty.
- Of course, it was stolen,

346
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:17,761
but <i>I'm</i> gonna find it.

347
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:20,798
Will you two go over
the schedules, please?

348
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,466
Okay, ready?

349
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:29,031
Monday, Wednesday and Friday,
2:00 to 4:00 p.m.,

350
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,369
junior boys and junior girls.

351
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:36,771
Tuesday and Thursday,
2:00 to 4:00 p.m., junior boys.

352
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,482
Thursday and Friday, 4:00 to 5:00...

353
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,211
- Roxanne.
- What?

354
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:45,847
I have to tell you this as a friend.
I can see right down your blouse.

355
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:49,151
I can see everything, too.

356
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:52,128
Tripper, is there something
seriously wrong with you?

357
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:55,688
Roxanne, I have what doctors call
<i>"very active glands".</i>

358
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:58,502
You're the only person I've told,
my folks <i>don't</i> even know.

359
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:01,731
Well, maybe you can have surgery
without them knowing.

360
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:06,537
- Heck with surgery. <i>Let's</i> wrestle.
- No, <i>let's</i> not, okay, Tripper? No...

361
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,842
The atomic skull crusher.

362
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:16,445
<i>Let's</i> not do this. Okay, Tripper?
<i>Let's</i> just stop right now. Okay? Okay?

363
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:27,029
- Dip lock.
- What? Tripper, no.

364
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:30,066
- Shark-infested waters!
- No, <i>don't</i> do that, Tripper. No. No.

365
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:31,999
Tripper!

366
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:37,842
<i>Let's</i> stop now, okay? No, huh? Let's...

367
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,837
<i>I'm</i> sorry about that blouse thing,
but somebody had to tell you.

368
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:43,346
Tripper, get off of me right now,
or I start screaming.

369
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:46,076
Oh, at the count of three, I guess, huh?
One, two...

370
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:47,549
- Help!
- Help!

371
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,153
Help!

372
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,812
- Help me!
- No, please.

373
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:52,685
- Somebody, help!
- Let me get off.

374
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,383
Get off me! Morty!

375
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:56,824
- What the <i>hell's</i> going on here?
- Oh, Morty!

376
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:59,192
Morty. Morty. Morty.

377
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:02,062
She attacked me.

378
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,500
- Give me a break, Harrison, will you?
- She came at me like an animal.

379
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:14,611
Would you get a hold of yourself?

380
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:22,781
<i>It's</i> great. You <i>can't</i> even see it
from outside, because of the bushes.

381
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,116
Okay, this is it.

382
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:27,783
This is it.
Now, in five seconds, we're talking five,

383
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,951
we are gonna have
the coolest cabin in camp.

384
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:31,858
- All right.
- Sweet.

385
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:34,625
- Yes, sir. Thank you, Mickey.
- Yes!

386
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:37,792
All right, <i>let's</i> do it.
<i>Let's</i> do it. You ready?

387
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:39,164
- Are you ready?
- <i>I'm</i> ready.

388
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:40,295
All right.

389
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:45,876
- Five, four, three, two, one.
- Do it!

390
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:55,145
- Hardware?
- Yeah, Crockett.

391
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:56,618
You're a dick.

392
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,701
Okay, pit stop. Change the tires.

393
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:29,810
Not bad.

394
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:33,476
You got pretty good form.
<i>It's</i> real good, Rudy.

395
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:34,813
Really?

396
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,280
Yeah. Well, you know,
<i>it's</i> your first time out.

397
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:40,190
<i>It's</i> okay.

398
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,486
You wanna get into shape, though,

399
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:47,054
you gotta come out every morning
with me. I'll make you into an animal.

400
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:52,393
Top physical condition,
you gotta pay the price.

401
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:54,630
- Okay.
- Okay.

402
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:01,301
<i>Attention campers.</i>

403
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:04,540
<i>Remember, this is killer bee season</i>
<i>in the North Woods,</i>

404
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:06,913

<i>any flying yellow things,</i>

<i>you're just asking for trouble.</i>

406
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:21,391
Hey, Crockett, I told Candace I was
gonna christen my boat, "The <i>Candace",</i>

407
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:24,261
and she just about had a heart attack.

408
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,964
I <i>don't</i> think she knew
how much in love we really were.

409
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:32,334
- Hey, Crockett, can you help me a sec?
- Sure, Candace.

410
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,579
Hurry up, come on.

411
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,814
What are you doing?

412
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:46,913
Crockett, this is the first time
I've ever kidnapped a guy.

413
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:50,153
- No kidding, huh?
- You'll be released unharmed.

414
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:54,526
I just want you long enough to tell you
that <i>I'm</i> really attracted to you.

00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,099
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

416
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,160
I think <i>I'm</i> special, too.

417
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,764
Hell, you're the only one in this camp

418
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:03,898
- Really?
- Yeah!

419
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:05,532
Well, what about Lance Cashman then?

420
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:06,735
- Lance Cashman?
- Yeah, Lance.

421
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:09,405
Lance Cashman is a total jerk-off!

422
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:15,013
All right! She likes me! She likes me!

423
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:20,086
<i>"Jerk-off"?</i> I <i>don't</i> jerk off.

424
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:24,751
- I <i>don't</i> know how to do this.
- Just throw it up in the air, and hit it.

425
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:43,840
- <i>I'm</i> sorry. I...
- Why <i>don't</i> we serve?

426
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:45,814
Yeah...

427
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:52,288
Did you see the way she
handed you the racket? She wants it.

428

- I thought you said you had it, meatball.
- Well, then, you serve, then.

433
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:13,837
Ready?

441
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:45,406
You bet.

442
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:47,937
Five.

443
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:52,511
I'll see that five.

444
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,947
- Want a card?
- No.

445
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,255
I'll take one. Eight.

446
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:04,456
15.

447
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,761
18. I'll stick.

20.

449
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:20,105
You shark! You're playing
some sort of system, <i>aren't</i> you?

450
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:24,579
You've been watching the cards,
marking the cards.

451
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:39,054
From the diaphragm. <i>Let's</i> see.

452
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:44,862
Oh, really? Really?

453
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:48,100
From the diaphragm.

454
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:55,468
<i>That's</i> not from the diaphragm. Ante up.

455
00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:00,244
- What do you do in the off season?
- Go to school.

456
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,280
20.

457
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:08,217
20? What are you,
some sort of madman?

458
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:12,755
Is that what they teach you
in that school of yours, 20?

459
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,729
I'll see your 20.

460
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:17,767
I hope you walk out of here with nothing.

461
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,467
I think I like history the most.

462

<i>It's</i> fun to imagine that <i>I'm</i>
in some other time, in a different place.

463
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:28,475
Shut up and look at your cards.

464
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,148
Blackjack.

I've had it. <i>That's</i> it.

468
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:50,767
Card monster. Get out!

469
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:58,199
I think you're pretty tired. I think you
ought to go home and go to sleep.

470
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,470
- This was great.
- Well, yeah, this was great.

471
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:02,375
You're the guy walking home
with all the peanuts.

472
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,179
If I were walking home with the peanuts,
<i>it'd</i> be incredible, <i>it'd</i> be sensational.

473
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:08,976
Are you going to bed?

474
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:10,714
No, I've called

for a little bit later this evening.

476

No midgets allowed. Sorry.

477
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:19,487
Well, enough of
this playing for peanuts.

478
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:22,828
Tomorrow night we play
for real stakes, zucchini.

479
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,462
Children starving in India,
and you're walking around

480
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:28,801
with a whole sombrero full of peanuts.

481
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:30,806
I hope you sleep well.

482
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,207

All right, gentlemen, big event.

- Operation Late Night Excitement.
- Another panty raid, Trip?

495

No questions, dog face!

496
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,479
Dress up and move out!

497
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,051
Tie him up.

<i>Don't</i> wake him. Tie him gently, now.
He needs his sleep.

On your guard.

500
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:41,066
Prepare to raise the casket.

501

<i>Won't</i> fit, Trip.

502
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,618
Spin him.

Company, rotate.

504
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:23,709
Right face. Right face.

Morning, Melnick.

511

Lots of room, lots of room. Looks fine,
Dad. Looks good, Dad. Come on.

Yo.

You <i>don't</i> have to run with me today,

00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,232
No, <i>I'd</i> rather run,

- Is your dad coming up today?
- He can't.

518

Mine <i>can't</i> either,

- No.

- Did you ever do any time? Prison?
- No.

523
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:45,655
- You know to hotwire a car?
- Not yet, no.

524
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:47,280
Well, you'll learn in class.

525
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:49,655
Did you read in the paper today
about the Polish terrorist?

526
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,159
- No.
- Yeah. A tragedy.

527
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:54,754
They sent this guy to blow up a car, and
the guy burns his mouth on the tailpipe.

<i>Let's</i> go, Spaz. Do it, Spaz.

593
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,260
- Gary, take it.
- Aw, Spaz!

594
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:22,264
- Sorry, guys.
- Sink it over here.

595
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:25,392
All right, this is how <i>it's</i> done.
This is how <i>it's</i> done.

596
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:28,198
Oh, looks good, Hardware. Looks good.

597
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:32,534
All right. <i>Let's</i> clean up.

598
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:41,617
- Try again. Try another one.
- Hey. Take it. Come on.

599
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:45,950
- You know, our guys <i>don't</i> look so good.
- They're not.

600
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:48,590
- Death, injury, blood and brains!
- Death, injury, blood and brains!

601
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:51,024
- Mohawks, Mohawks, win again!
- Mohawks, Mohawks, win again!

602
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,995
- Go, North Star, go!
- Go, North Star, go!

603
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:57,066
Son of a gun, son of a gun!

604
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,766
- Go, North Star, go!
- Go, North Star, go!

605
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:06,638
Hey, Wheels,
you're going home in an ambulance.

606
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:08,972
- Nice shirt, Crockett.
- Thanks.

607
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:10,410
- All right, guys.
- Thanks. Mook.

608
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:12,675
<i>Let's</i> go, <i>let's</i> go. Come on,
<i>let's</i> play some basketball here.

609
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:13,841
Come on. Here we go.

610
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,476
- Go, North Star, go!
- Go, North Star, go!

611
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:27,296
Hey, nice going, Mohawks, nice going.

612
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:29,127
Assholes.

613
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,799
- Am I all right?
- That was a great try, buddy.

614
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:34,598
Oh, yeah. I think we're in big trouble.

615
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:36,935
That <i>Crockett's</i> really cute.

616
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:39,869
Yeah, but he <i>can't</i> play basketball
worth a shit.

617
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:43,343
Go, North Star, go.

618
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:49,817
There are five guys.
They play offense and defense,

619
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,615
but they play
at different ends of the court,

620
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:53,849
and they switch sides at half-time.

621
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,086
Wheels!

622
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:00,460
Hardware!

623
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,756
- You all right?
- Yeah.

624
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,265
Help me, Spaz, come on.

625
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,859
Take it easy, easy. Come on.

626
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:09,973
Now you know
why they call that guy Rhino.

627
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,635
- Oh, my God, his nose is bleeding.
- <i>It's</i> gonna get even bigger now.

628
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:15,041
Jackie.

629
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:17,374
- Come here. You okay?
- Yeah.

630
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:20,108
Hardware Renzetti, girls.
<i>It's</i> just a nosebleed.

631
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,811
Looks like <i>he's</i> gonna be
at the big social tonight.

632
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,114
He'll be there.

633
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,689
It really <i>doesn't</i> look any worse, really.

634
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:28,414
- Really?
- Go out there and kill 'em.

635
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:30,049
- All right.
- Fazul!

636
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:31,491
- Come on!
- Hardware!

637
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:32,721
- Go, North Star, go!
- Go, North Star, go!

638
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:33,922
- Go, North Star, go!
- Go, North Star, go!

639
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:36,397
- Go, North Star, go!
- Go, North Star, go!

640
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:45,274
Hey, Larry, you scored!

641
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:49,869
Way to go! Okay, you guys,
feed Fink, <i>he's</i> our hot man.

642
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,110
All right, there!

643
00:45:53,817 --> 00:45:54,909
Okay, cover me!

644
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:58,647
Come on, <i>let's</i> go! <i>Let's</i> go!
<i>Let's</i> kill 'em!

645
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,725
- Come on, guys. <i>That's</i> it.
- Oh, sure.

646
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:08,464
Hey, Larry! Larry, again.
Do it again, Larry!

647
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:21,609
- <i>It's</i> all right, <i>it's</i> okay!
- <i>It's</i> all right, <i>it's</i> okay!

648
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:23,270
- We can beat 'em anyway!
- We can beat 'em anyway!

649
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,972
- <i>It's</i> all right, <i>it's</i> okay!
- <i>It's</i> all right, <i>it's</i> okay!

650
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:27,846
- We can beat 'em anyway!
- We can beat 'em anyway!

651
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:37,556
Okay, the <i>zone's</i> not working.

652
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:40,162
They're a little bit too good
to cover man to man,

653
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:42,528
and we <i>can't</i> shoot for shit.

654
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,260
What kind of talk is that
for a coach, huh?

655
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:46,928
- Yeah, Trip.
- Look, <i>I'm</i> not gonna lie to you guys.

656
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:49,028
<i>There's</i> no way
we're gonna beat this team.

657
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:52,074
- What are we gonna do, Trip?
- We're gonna lose.

658
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:53,836
What?

659
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:57,611
But we can lose with some self-respect.
And <i>here's</i> the idea.

660
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,651
- Go, North Star, go!
- Go, North Star, go!

661
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:07,121
- Go, North Star, go!
- Go, North Star, go!

662
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,964
Morty, nice team spirit.

663
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:17,692
I'll talk to you after the game, Tripper.

664
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:19,701
- How we doing?
- Late as usual, Morty.

665
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:21,361
Where were you, young man?

666
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:24,065
Okay, you guys, a little teamwork, now.

667
00:47:31,248 --> 00:47:32,237
Yeah!

668
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,246
Beautiful.

669
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:45,461
Spaz! Get in. Spaz, hurry up!

670
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:54,568
This is the proudest moment
in North Star history!

671
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:20,453
Forget it, Spaz. They all want me.

672
00:48:26,937 --> 00:48:29,269
You know,
Candace is sure looking good tonight.

673
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:32,274
So he offered me 200 bucks
to run the sailing program.

674
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:36,813
I said, "Forget <i>it!"</i> I mean, 200 bucks
<i>doesn't</i> even buy me a pair of shoes.

675
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:38,608
I mean, <i>I'm</i> the best.

676
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:41,311
Now the serious partying can begin.

677
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:42,782
- Okay.
- Hey.

678
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:47,814
Okay! Virgins on the right,
non-virgins on the left.

679
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:51,420
You fellows can divide them up
any way you like.

680
00:48:58,835 --> 00:49:00,598
I got the virgins this time,
you had them last time.

681
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:02,399
Okay, you got them,
but I get them next time.

682
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:04,030
- Okay, buddy.
- <i>Let's</i> go. <i>There's</i> two right there.

683
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:05,369
Come on.

684
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:08,439
- Hi, Roxanne.
- Hi, Morty.

685
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:10,536
Really groovy tunes, eh?

686
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:15,184
Hi, Jackie. Hi, Wendy.

687
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:19,750
<i>There's</i> Jackie.
Why <i>don't</i> you go ask her to dance?

688
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:24,452
- No, that <i>Wendy's</i> driving me wild.
- Yeah, but Jackie wants it.

689
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:27,787
I have to talk with Roxanne

690
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:30,093
about a highly personal matter
about one of the campers.

691
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,599
Will you excuse us for a second?

692
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:33,465
- Yeah, well, I was...
- Yeah.

693
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:44,776
Is that a bra you're wearing, or are you
expecting an assassination attempt?

694
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:51,146
Are those Clorets in your pocket
or are you just glad to see me?

695
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:55,486
Okay. We're even. Three years of this.

696
00:49:56,593 --> 00:50:01,053
I <i>don't</i> think I have many lines left.
Frankly, Roxanne, <i>I'm</i> frightened.

697
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:03,792
Oh, <i>don't</i> go human on me now, Trip.

698
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,130
I really like to dance.

699
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:11,302
<i>It's</i> the music, I guess. It starts my feet
tapping and I get all happy inside.

700
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:13,475
I guess <i>it's</i> just
something I was born with.

701
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:15,511
Kind of a birth defect, huh?

702
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:20,240
- <i>Let's</i> go get some air.
- I think not.

703
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:23,853
Well, <i>I'm</i> trying.

704
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:27,550
So, keep trying.

705
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,888
I gotta go change the record.

706
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:38,757
You can change the record,
but <i>don't</i> you change. Promise me?

707
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:45,706
I'll be waiting right here. Hurry!
Rush, darling! Rush, darling.

708
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:22,143
- You know something, A. L?
- What?

709
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:26,739
- This is a very serious moment.
- It is?

710
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:29,550
<i>Don't</i> you know what tonight is?

711
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:34,323
<i>Tonight's</i> our third anniversary.

712
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:37,950
- Three years ago, tonight, we met.
- Oh, that is serious.

713
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,393
Oh, God, <i>I'm</i> sorry. I forgot.

714
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:53,205
Happy anniversary.

715
00:51:57,013 --> 00:52:01,143
You know, Wheels, for a jerk,
you're really a nice guy.

716
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:03,243
Well.

717
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,249
- Come on, <i>let's</i> dance.
- Oh, no.

718
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:08,449
- Come on!
- No, I <i>don't</i> know how.

719
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:12,722
One, two, three. Simple as that.
Come on, <i>let's</i> dance.

720
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,897
I'll lead, you follow.

721
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,276
<i>Attention, campers.</i>

722
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:37,217
<i>Arts and crafts has been canceled</i>
<i>due to bad taste.</i>

723
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,788
<i>All junior girls are now junior boys.</i>

724
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:40,948
<i>And Nurse Omako says</i>

725
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:44,151
<i>that the raccoon fever epidemic</i>
<i>is officially over.</i>

726
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:47,023
<i>Hey, you on the water skis!</i>

727
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:59,499
- I saw you dancing with Roxanne.
- Oh, yeah?

728
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:04,511
Well, she sort of cornered me,

729
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:07,947
and there was nothing I could do
without embarrassing her.

730
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:10,115
Do you like her?

731
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:15,549
Well, I feel sorry for her, you know?
<i>She's</i> got a glass eye.

732
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:17,860
And <i>I'm</i> one of the few people

733
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:20,588
who knows exactly which eye to look at
when they're talking to her,

734
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:23,461
so <i>she's</i> sort of fixated on me.

735
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,232
Well, I like her.

736
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:29,395
Well, you're not exactly
known for your taste.

737
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:34,636
I'll probably just use her
for the rest of the summer, and then

738
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:39,348
throw her on the scrap heap with all the
rest of the women that I've destroyed.

739
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:44,011
I have to go on this overnight.

740
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,749
<i>I'm</i> taking the CITs on
an overnight for the next couple of days,

741
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,916
so you're gonna have to
do your own training, son.

742
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:53,086
I want you to run two miles today,
and two and a half tomorrow.

743
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:54,595
I've never run that far.

744
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:56,825
Neither have I,
but <i>somebody's</i> gotta do it.

745
00:53:56,933 --> 00:54:00,232
I <i>can't</i> be expected to do it.
<i>Somebody's</i> gotta do it,

746
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:04,170
and it <i>can't</i> be me,
because <i>I'm</i> too busy.

747
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:06,401
I have responsibilities.

748
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:09,535
<i>I'm</i> the entertainment director
for the overnight.

749
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:11,578
Come here.

750
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:14,980
<i>Somebody's</i> gotta make these PA
announcements for me while <i>I'm</i> gone.

751
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,747
Wake up. Lights out. Public Service.

752
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:19,184
Otherwise, <i>I'm</i> gonna get
in a lot of trouble.

753
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:20,381
- No.
- So, <i>I'd</i> appreciate it

754
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:22,390
- if you could help me out on this...
- No, Trip, I <i>don't</i> wanna

755
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:26,121
- do the announcement. No... Wear...
...and accept this nomination.

756
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:30,026
- Trip.
- Okay, now,

757
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:32,397
all you have to do is
turn on this power switch here.

758
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:33,799
- Everything will be hunky-dory, okay?
- No, Trip,

759
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:35,336
I <i>don't</i> wanna do the announcements.
Come on...

760
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:38,407
And you can start by telling
all the CITs to meet me

761
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:40,976
down at the boat dock <i>immediamente.</i>

762
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,079
I'll see you in a couple days.

763
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:49,618
Hey, remember,
run two miles, then two and a half,

764
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:53,086
and then run three or four
if I <i>don't</i> come back, all right?

765
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:57,455
- Problem?
- We <i>don't</i> have steering problems,

766
00:54:57,594 --> 00:54:58,686
we've got manpower problems.

767
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,422
You're going too fast, Trip, slow down.

768
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:02,498
Oh, no, don't.

769
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,101
- Okay, Finkel.
- What?

770
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:07,567
- Paddle!
- Hey, you're splashing me!

771
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:09,138
Paddle!

772
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:12,673
- Nice and even backstroke, Hardware.
- Yes, sir.

773
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:19,846
Spaz, keep us in the sun.
I wanna even out my tan.

774
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:23,645
Look at that! Got it?

775
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,014
- Spaz!
- Hey, Spaz!

776
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:34,360
<i>You love me, baby</i>
<i>But I love you and you love me</i>

777
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:37,625
<i>So let's just walla walla</i>

778
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:41,828
<i>Six to eight hours a day</i>
<i>Down by the mango tree</i>

779
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:45,338
<i>Dang it, you, dang it, you</i>
<i>Dang it, you said</i>

780
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:48,839
<i>I love you</i>
<i>If you love me</i>

781
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:51,310
Come on, you know the words, Rocky!

782
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:55,680
<i>I love me, so let's walla walla</i>

783
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:59,781
<i>Down by the mango tree</i>

784
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:06,292
<i>And I love you, if you love me</i>

785
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:10,990
<i>But you love you, and I love me</i>

786
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:15,537
<i>So let's walla walla</i>
<i>Down by the mango tree</i>

787
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:20,371
<i>Let's walla walla</i>
<i>Down by the mango tree</i>

788
00:56:31,254 --> 00:56:33,347
Have you kissed many guys?

789
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:38,457
- Does family count?
- No, like, I meant real guys.

790
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:43,996
Well, two. Only, one was a real creep.

791
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:48,529
How did the creep do it?

792
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:50,802
Spaz, what do you mean,
how did he do it?

793
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:55,640
No, like, I mean, did he ask you,
or did he just do it?

794
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:58,309
He just did it.

795
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,045
<i>It's</i> a weird moon.

796
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:07,689
The moon kills, you know.

797
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,088
It feeds off the earth.

798
00:57:12,195 --> 00:57:14,254
On a night like this,

799
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,262
one of us could get up
in the middle of the night,

800
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:18,732
grab an ax,
and cut <i>somebody's</i> head off.

801
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,265
I remember a night like this
a few years ago.

802
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:27,571
A guy and a girl went out driving,
it was one of their first dates.

803
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:30,440
It started out kind of casual,
but they ended up deciding to go park,

804
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:33,015
not too far from here,
as a matter of fact.

805
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:36,085
While they're going at it,
listening to the radio,

806
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:38,380
all of a sudden,
a news bulletin broke in.

807
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:41,423
<i>"A dangerous lunatic has escaped

808
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:44,925
<i>"from the hospital for
the criminally insane at Two <i>Pines."</i>

809
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:46,961
Oh, come on, Trip.

810
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:51,362
They described him as a monster,
six-and-a-half-feet tall,

811
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,936
260 pounds,

812
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:58,574
with one horrible distinguishing feature,

813
00:57:59,442 --> 00:58:03,708
a sharpened stainless-steel hook

814
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:08,279
where his right hand used to be.

815
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,283
That was enough for the guy.

816
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:14,720
He slammed the car into gear,
floored it, bounced off a tree,

817
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:17,156
<i>didn't</i> stop
till they got to the <i>girl's</i> house.

818
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:20,093
Got out of his side,
walked around to hers.

819
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:24,597
There, hanging in the door,
covered with blood,

820
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:28,231
- was a stainless-steel hook.
- Oh!

821
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:31,432
The strangest part,
is that after all these years,

822
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:35,568
after the biggest manhunt
in Two <i>Pines'</i> history,

823
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:37,976
they never found the killer.

824
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:42,711
Some people say
<i>he's</i> still up here in the woods,

825
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:45,413
waiting for the chance to kill again.

826
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:49,757
And I say...

827
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:52,987
I say they're right!

828
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:03,829
- Hey, my dinner!
- Hey, listen, <i>that's</i> a bullshit story.

829
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:06,373
No, you guys, <i>it's</i> true. I heard it before.

830
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:08,637
- Yeah.
- Only, I heard it was on a beach.

831
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:09,803
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well...

832
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:11,540
No, I heard it happened in a park.

833
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:15,015
Oh, I heard it,
but the guy was missing a foot.

834
00:59:15,151 --> 00:59:18,314
How could the guy have
a hook on his foot?

835
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:29,456
- Now, that was nice, Tripper.
- Thank you.

836
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,592
Thank you, very much.

837
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:36,660
I think I am lying
on some sort of animal,

838
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:40,105
like a porcupine.

839
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,972
- Just a broken beer bottle.
- Oh.

840
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,843
I was wondering
what you were yelling about.

841
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:51,320
- Where are you going?
- <i>I'm</i> going swimming.

842
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:56,822
- The <i>water's</i> great! Come on in.
- No!

843
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,928
You're not supposed to swim
for half an hour

844
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:01,019
after close physical contact,

845
01:00:01,164 --> 01:00:04,600
- you get bad cramps.
- Come on, chicken, <i>it's</i> not so cold.

846
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:07,499
- No, I know you're lying.
- Come on.

847
01:00:08,705 --> 01:00:10,605
All right.

848
01:00:16,879 --> 01:00:20,781
- <i>It's</i> not so bad, is it?
- Worse than I ever imagined!

849
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:24,115
Come here, <i>there's</i> a real cold spot.

850
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:37,661
I've heard of the buddy system,
but this is ridiculous.

851
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:41,328
Tripper, you really talk too much.

852
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:43,769
Well, I was just wondering if these
were shark-infested waters.

853
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:45,465
Shut up.

854
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:55,813
- Hey, there is a shark down there.
- My God, there is.

855
01:00:55,918 --> 01:00:57,010
I think <i>we'd</i> better go back

856
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:00,248
to my sleeping bag
before something goes wrong.

857
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:05,323
What happened? Where were you?

858
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:10,063
- I was with Jackie in the woods.
- In the woods?

859
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:13,163
- Right where you want her.
- Yes.

860
01:01:13,603 --> 01:01:18,097
Oh, Spaz! You old make-out master!
How far did you get?

861
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:20,801
Oh, we just went down to Lookout Point,
and then we got cold...

862
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:24,243
No, no, no, no! How did you make out?

863
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:27,178
Well, you know, we just kind of talked.

864
01:01:27,283 --> 01:01:29,478
You had her in the woods,
and you just talked?

865
01:01:29,585 --> 01:01:31,450
- No, no, well...
- You <i>didn't</i> do anything.

866
01:01:31,554 --> 01:01:34,387
- We were sort of sitting...
- You <i>didn't</i> do anything!

867
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:36,048
I...

868
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:40,461
- I held her hand when we walked home.
- Held her hand?

869
01:01:42,465 --> 01:01:44,797
Spaz, you're on your way!

870
01:01:44,934 --> 01:01:46,902
- <i>That's</i> great!
- Yeah? Yeah?

871
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:48,698
- Held her hand?
- Yeah.

872
01:01:48,805 --> 01:01:50,705
- In the woods?
- Yeah.

873
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:53,105
- And it was dark?
- Yeah.

874
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:55,106
Wow!

875
01:01:55,845 --> 01:01:59,781
- <i>Let's</i> celebrate.
- Huh? Right.

876
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:02,151
Here, help yourself.

877
01:02:02,285 --> 01:02:05,482
- I think I'll have Cheezies.
- The Cheezies?

878
01:02:05,621 --> 01:02:08,715
Yeah. I'll have Cheezies, too.

879
01:02:15,698 --> 01:02:18,963
- Bobby?
- Oh, no.

880
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:24,236
Oh, no, <i>don't</i> ever call me Bobby.
All right?

881
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:28,643
I mean, my grandmother
calls me Bobby. I hate it.

882
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:31,178
So, I like it when you call me Crockett.

883
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:32,906
- Okay.
- All right?

884
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:37,782
- Wanna hear me say it?
- Yeah, okay.

885
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:40,253
Okay. Crockett.

886
01:02:43,459 --> 01:02:44,756
Crockett.

887
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:49,191
Crockett.

888
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:49,553
- Going in. Yes, you are.
- No, no, no, no!

889
01:03:59,535 --> 01:04:01,662
Looking good. All right!

890
01:04:04,106 --> 01:04:05,334
<i>Important announcement!</i>

891
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:08,239
<i>Some hunters have been seen</i>
<i>in the woods near Piney Ridge Trail,</i>

892
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:09,777
<i>and the Fish and Game Commission</i>
<i>has raised</i>

893
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:12,507
<i>the legal kill limit on campers to three!</i>

894
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:16,107
<i>So, if you're hiking today, please wear</i>
<i>something bright, and keep low.</i>

895
01:04:16,219 --> 01:04:17,584
<i>Good luck.</i>

896
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:29,022
<i>What's</i> the matter with you?

897
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:32,191
You're pacing like an expectant father
with the clap.

898
01:04:34,837 --> 01:04:38,000
- The <i>Olympiad's</i> tomorrow.
- So?

899
01:04:38,975 --> 01:04:41,944
- I wanna do well.
- You wanna do well?

900
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:44,444
Bet every dime you got
on Camp Mohawk.

901
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,947
I <i>don't</i> wanna mess up again.

902
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:50,481
Well, <i>let's</i> see what you're entered in.

903
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:56,153
Gerner, Gerner, Gerner.

904
01:04:57,193 --> 01:04:59,127
The potato race.

905
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:02,629
Damn it, <i>don't</i> they know
you're just a kid?

906
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:07,533
Two years ago,
a boy fell on a potato, mashed himself.

907
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:12,368
<i>Let's</i> see what else you're in. Egg toss!

908
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:13,975
Oh, no.

909
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:18,479
Probably, the most punishing
of all food-related sports.

910
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:22,745
- <i>I'm</i> good at that one.
- Sure, you got the build for it.

911
01:05:22,885 --> 01:05:24,318
Oh, <i>don't</i> worry.

912
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:28,652
You <i>won't</i> screw up tomorrow,
no worse than anybody else, anyway.

913
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:33,559
Are you gonna go and see Roxanne
after <i>Morty's</i> rally?

914
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:36,928
Could be.

915
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,125
After the way she treated me
on the overnight,

916
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:43,763
<i>I'm</i> a little afraid to be alone with her,
and I think you know what I mean.

917
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:46,273
I think you like her.

918
01:05:46,976 --> 01:05:51,208
Really. Admit it.
You really do like her, <i>don't</i> you?

919
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:57,211
Yes, you do. Come on, admit it.
You like her.

920
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:01,447
Ah, you like her. You <i>won't</i> admit it.

921
01:06:13,669 --> 01:06:15,398
You pig!

922
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:28,416
<i>Hi. I'm Morty Melnick.</i>

923
01:06:28,517 --> 01:06:30,712
- Hi, Mickey!
- Hi, Mickey!

924
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:33,512
<i>And we at Camp North Star,</i>
<i>would like to welcome</i>

925
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:35,249
<i>our Camp Mohawk competitors...</i>

926
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:38,088
- Camp North Star sucks!
- Camp North Star sucks!

927
01:06:38,194 --> 01:06:42,096
Let me at 'em, let me at 'em,
let me at 'em!

928
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:44,365
<i>Quiet down, quiet down.</i>

929
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:47,800
<i>To our annual two-day Olympiad.</i>

930
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:51,769
<i>So, let the games begin!</i>

931
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:45,525
Uh-oh.

932
01:07:46,762 --> 01:07:48,992
You got any last-minute advice, Trip?

933
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:53,831
Yeah, try to jump very, very high.

934
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:57,136
Hey, yeah. Thanks.

935
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:59,298
Good luck.

936
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:05,779
Well, we're getting creamed
all over the place.

937
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:07,246
<i>I'm</i> your guy.

938
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:16,418
- Come on, jump!
- Over!

939
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:20,552
Hey, are you okay?

940
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:28,002
Get into it! Come on, do it!

941
01:08:35,744 --> 01:08:38,713
Just let me know
when you've had enough, all right?

942
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:42,145
You're out!

943
01:08:53,028 --> 01:08:54,359
- All right!
- Come on, Jackie!

944
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:55,521
Come on!

945
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:57,690
Go, go, go!

946
01:09:01,403 --> 01:09:04,429
- Watch out, Jackie!
- No, don't!

947
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:07,837
Oh, my God!

948
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:16,479
<i>She's</i> hurt. Hey, get the stretcher
from the infirmary.

949
01:09:16,585 --> 01:09:18,746
I think her <i>leg's</i> broken.

950
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:36,970
Hey, gang, come on. Look it, just 'cause
we're losing, <i>doesn't</i> mean <i>it's</i> all over.

951
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:38,334
Cut the crap, Morty.

952
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:40,465
I mean, the Mohawks have beaten us
the last 12 years,

953
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:41,873
they're gonna beat us again.

954
01:09:41,977 --> 01:09:46,243
<i>That's</i> just the attitude
we <i>don't</i> need, Phil.

955
01:09:47,082 --> 01:09:50,950
Sure. Mohawk has beaten us
12 years in a row.

956
01:09:51,086 --> 01:09:52,849
Sure, they're terrific athletes.

957
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:54,718
They've got the best equipment
that money can buy.

958
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:59,089
Hell, every team they're sending over
here has their own personal masseuse.

959
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:01,595
Not masseur, masseuse.

960
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:04,462
But it <i>doesn't</i> matter.

961
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:09,270
Do you know that every Mohawk
competitor has an electrocardiogram,

962
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:11,771
blood and urine tests every 48 hours,

963
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:15,435
to see if <i>there's</i> any change
in his physical condition?

964
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:18,104
Do you know that they use the most
sophisticated training methods

965
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:20,978
from the Soviet Union,
East and West Germany,

966
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:23,744
and the newest Olympic power,
Trinidad and Tobago?

967
01:10:23,852 --> 01:10:25,683
But it <i>doesn't</i> matter.

968
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:29,814
It just <i>doesn't</i> matter!
It just <i>doesn't</i> matter!

969
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:34,362
I tell you, it just <i>doesn't</i> matter!
It just <i>doesn't</i> matter!

970
01:10:34,496 --> 01:10:36,361
It just <i>doesn't</i> matter!

971
01:10:36,498 --> 01:10:40,264
- It just <i>doesn't</i> matter!
- It just <i>doesn't</i> matter!

972
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:42,303
- It just <i>doesn't</i> matter!
- It just <i>doesn't</i> matter!

973
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:47,034
And even...
And even if we win, if we win!

974
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:50,436
Even if we win,

975
01:10:50,546 --> 01:10:53,208
even if we play so far over our heads

976
01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:56,648
that our noses bleed
for a week to ten days,

977
01:10:56,752 --> 01:11:01,553
even if God in heaven above
comes down and points his hand

978
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:03,715
at our side of the field,

979
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:06,555
even if every man, woman, and child

980
01:11:06,695 --> 01:11:11,132
held hands together
and prayed for us to win,

981
01:11:11,233 --> 01:11:13,531
it just <i>wouldn't</i> matter,

982
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:16,832
because all the really good-Iooking girls

983
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:19,271
would still go out
with the guys from Mohawk,

984
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:22,037
<i>'cause they got all the money!

985
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:28,348
It just <i>doesn't</i> matter
if we win or we lose!

986
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:31,515
It just <i>doesn't</i> matter.

987
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:35,488
- It just <i>doesn't</i> matter!
- It just <i>doesn't</i> matter!

988
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:38,856
- It just <i>doesn't</i> matter!
- It just <i>doesn't</i> matter!

989
01:12:03,285 --> 01:12:05,480
Starters, take your mark.

990
01:12:09,058 --> 01:12:12,255
- Come on!
- Come on!

991
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:12,152
Okay, you guys. We got two outs,
<i>it's</i> the bottom of the ninth.

992
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:14,154
Carla is our winning run
on second base.

993
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:15,416
What do you think we ought to do, Trip?

994
01:13:15,524 --> 01:13:17,424
Well, Jody, I <i>don't</i> wanna put
any more pressure on you

995
01:13:17,526 --> 01:13:18,857
than is absolutely necessary,

996
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:22,522
but there is a scout here today from
the New York Yankees organization,

997
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:24,861
and if my ball club could win,
well, I would get a chance

998
01:13:24,967 --> 01:13:26,992
to coach at the professional level.

999
01:13:27,102 --> 01:13:30,196
Seriously, Jody. You see that girl
out there with the big boobs?

1000
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:33,604
- Hit the ball to her, she <i>can't</i> catch.
- No sweat.

1001
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:36,041
- All right. Well, <i>let's</i> go.
- Come on, Jody.

1002
01:13:36,145 --> 01:13:38,409
All right, Jody!

1003
01:13:48,323 --> 01:13:50,018
Double time, double time!

1004
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:14,679
Come on, Wheels!

1005
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:18,711
Go!

1006
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,432
God, you're a pitstink.

1007
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:48,911
Watch it, watch it.

1008
01:14:53,021 --> 01:14:56,354
One, two, three!

1009
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:06,364
How could they do this to me?
I <i>can't</i> stack. I <i>can't</i> even walk.

1010
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:09,665
Come off it, Spaz. You can so.
I've seen you walk.

1011
01:15:09,771 --> 01:15:13,207
Anyway, you can do anything
you want to, if you want to bad enough.

1012
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:16,243
Besides, I know you can.

1013
01:15:17,379 --> 01:15:18,846
Come on.

1014
01:15:20,582 --> 01:15:25,884
- Spaz! Spaz! Spaz!
- Spaz! Spaz! Spaz!

1015
01:15:35,097 --> 01:15:36,621
Stackers get ready!

1016
01:15:36,798 --> 01:15:38,789
- Spaz! Spaz! Spaz!
- Spaz! Spaz! Spaz!

1017
01:15:38,901 --> 01:15:40,027
Get set!

1018
01:15:43,171 --> 01:15:46,902
- Spaz! Spaz! Spaz!
- Spaz! Spaz! Spaz!

1019
01:16:24,313 --> 01:16:25,678
Spaz!

1020
01:16:28,784 --> 01:16:31,617
You did it! I told you!

1021
01:16:40,062 --> 01:16:44,590
<i>That's</i> right, Fink.
Look at those steaming weenies.

1022
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:47,592
And you know
what they're saying, Larry?

1023
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:52,368
They're saying, "This is the year
that Fink beats The <i>Stomach."</i>

1024
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:58,202
No. <i>It's</i> a couple of guys over here,
but they're saying it.

1025
01:16:59,314 --> 01:17:01,874
No! Save it.

1026
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,845
Save it for this guy.

1027
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:36,414
- What, no mustard?
- Okay, hands up.

1028
01:17:36,551 --> 01:17:38,519
You guys know the rules.
You got five minutes.

1029
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:42,989
Half-eaten weenies <i>don't</i> count.
May the best man win. Ready, set...

1030
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:48,327
You gotta want it, Fink!

1031
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:51,991
Come on, give a hundred percent for us!
Come on!

1032
01:17:52,934 --> 01:17:57,030
Come on, you gotta want it, Larry.
You gotta want it. This is your year.

1033
01:17:57,139 --> 01:17:58,834
You gotta want it, Larry.

1034
01:18:00,742 --> 01:18:04,041
Every day <i>I'm</i> eating
more and more hot dogs.

1035
01:18:04,146 --> 01:18:07,673
Come on, pace.
Pace, baby. Left. Swallow.

1036
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:11,378
Right. Swallow. Fight hard, Larry!
You gotta want it!

1037
01:18:12,721 --> 01:18:16,248
The <i>Stomach's</i> worried, Larry.
He <i>doesn't</i> want it bad enough.

1038
01:18:17,826 --> 01:18:22,456
Come on, Fink! This is weenie war! Eat!

1039
01:18:22,597 --> 01:18:25,532
Come on, stretch that stomach, Fink!

1040
01:18:26,735 --> 01:18:30,193
Come on, eat, Fink, eat! Eat!

1041
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:35,767
Please! Please, Fink, please!

1042
01:18:36,812 --> 01:18:40,407
Larry! Larry! Come on! Eat, Fink!

1043
01:18:40,515 --> 01:18:42,710
Eat!

1044
01:18:47,589 --> 01:18:49,284
The winner!

1045
01:18:55,697 --> 01:19:00,031
- Way to go, Fink.
- You beat The Stomach, Larry.

1046
01:19:03,371 --> 01:19:05,601
All right, now, we're close,
and we could win this thing,

1047
01:19:05,707 --> 01:19:07,197
- so <i>let's</i> get serious.
- Damn right.

1048
01:19:07,309 --> 01:19:08,537
Now, <i>there's</i> only one event left,

1049
01:19:08,643 --> 01:19:11,339
<i>it's</i> a four-mile marathon,
<i>it's</i> worth 20 points.

1050
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:14,574
Unfortunately, our best distance runner,
Jackie, broke her ankle.

1051
01:19:14,683 --> 01:19:16,446
You jerk.

1052
01:19:16,551 --> 01:19:19,884
So, we need a distance man.
Any ideas?

1053
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:21,818
- You, buddy.
- Oh, <i>don't</i> look at me.

1054
01:19:21,923 --> 01:19:24,016
<i>I'd</i> be puking after the first mile.

1055
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,753
- Well, <i>somebody's</i> gotta do it.
- <i>Finkelstein's</i> your man, sir.

1056
01:19:26,862 --> 01:19:29,854
- Larry Finkelstein.
- Yeah!

1057
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:34,630
- <i>Here's</i> your man.
- Come on, Tripper. No!

1058
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:38,172
- Where?
- Right here. Rudy Gerner.

1059
01:19:38,673 --> 01:19:40,163
Please don't.

1060
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:42,368
- <i>He's</i> the best we got.
- Get serious.

1061
01:19:42,511 --> 01:19:45,480
I mean, no offense, Tripper,
but that kid <i>can't</i> even catch a football.

1062
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:47,445
Well, for your information, Phillip,

1063
01:19:47,549 --> 01:19:51,883
Rudy is a three-time Junior State
Long-Distance Medal Award Winner.

1064
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:53,988
- Bullshit!
- And he won

1065
01:19:54,089 --> 01:19:57,718
a presidential citation from
his Committee on Physical Fitness.

1066
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,328
- <i>He's</i> lying to me. I know it, <i>he's</i> lying.
- Come on.

1067
01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:03,864
- I <i>can't</i> do it, Tripper.
- Yeah, you can. Believe me.

1068
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:06,456
Morty, give him a chance.
No one else wants to...

1069
01:20:06,568 --> 01:20:09,230
Come on, Morty! Make up your mind!

1070
01:20:09,371 --> 01:20:12,033
Yeah, come on, Morty,
for once make a decision.

1071
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:16,167
All right! Gerner runs the marathon.

1072
01:20:19,915 --> 01:20:22,713
What do you think our chances are?

1073
01:20:23,218 --> 01:20:27,245
- I hope I <i>don't</i> let you down, Tripper.
- You won't.

1074
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:30,286
<i>Let's</i> go get laid before the race, huh?

1075
01:20:35,063 --> 01:20:36,690
- <i>How's</i> the leg?
- <i>It's</i> okay.

1076
01:20:36,798 --> 01:20:38,789
Yeah, for now,
but if you <i>don't</i> win, we cut it off.

1077
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:41,130
Okay, <i>here's</i> the thing.

1078
01:20:41,403 --> 01:20:43,667
On open ground,
this guy could probably take you,

1079
01:20:43,772 --> 01:20:45,501
but you're running through the woods,
you got a chance.

1080
01:20:45,607 --> 01:20:47,802
You're smaller, and you can run
through the bushes a little faster.

1081
01:20:47,909 --> 01:20:50,275
You can duck underneath them,
you know, you're like a little rabbit.

1082
01:20:50,378 --> 01:20:51,606
Okay? You're Rudy Rabbit, okay?

1083
01:20:51,713 --> 01:20:54,341
When you're running, think,
<i>"I'm</i> Rudy the <i>Rabbit",</i> okay?

1084
01:20:54,449 --> 01:20:56,679
Stay with him, stay right behind him,
until you get to the woods.

1085
01:20:56,785 --> 01:20:58,844
When you get to the woods,
pass him, just fly by him.

1086
01:20:58,954 --> 01:21:01,013
<i>Don't</i> even look in the rear-view mirror.
Just move, move, move!

1087
01:21:01,122 --> 01:21:03,352
You gotta be way ahead of him
when you get to the edge of the woods,

1088
01:21:03,458 --> 01:21:05,392
<i>'cause when you get out,
<i>there's</i> a half a mile of open ground,

1089
01:21:05,493 --> 01:21:06,983
and <i>that's</i> where you're gonna have
a lot of trouble.

1090
01:21:07,095 --> 01:21:09,393
You gotta have a hell of a lead
when you get out of the woods, okay?

1091
01:21:09,497 --> 01:21:11,260
All right, <i>what's</i> your name?

1092
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:12,696
- Rudy Gerner.
- No, <i>it's</i> not.

1093
01:21:12,801 --> 01:21:14,200
<i>It's</i> Rudy the Rabbit, okay?
Rudy the Rabbit!

1094
01:21:14,302 --> 01:21:15,564
- <i>What's</i> your name?
- Rudy the Rabbit.

1095
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:18,867
Rudy the Rabbit, the winner.
You're the winner, Rudy the Rabbit.

1096
01:21:18,974 --> 01:21:21,738
<i>Let's</i> hear it for him.

1097
01:21:27,983 --> 01:21:29,382
All right, come on.

1098
01:21:29,484 --> 01:21:32,578
Runners take your mark!

1099
01:21:33,755 --> 01:21:35,313
Get set!

1100
01:21:38,493 --> 01:21:42,623
Run, you rascal rabbit! Run!

1101
01:23:59,834 --> 01:24:02,769
My God, <i>he's</i> sprinting!

1102
01:24:50,985 --> 01:24:54,648
- Bye-bye, Rudy. You did real good.
- Thanks.

1103
01:24:54,789 --> 01:24:57,986
- You coming back next year?
- Yeah, for sure.

1104
01:24:58,126 --> 01:25:00,822
Well, stay in shape.
Get on a weight program.

1105
01:25:00,962 --> 01:25:02,452
Stop hanging around
with all those friends of yours,

1106
01:25:02,564 --> 01:25:04,589
they're a bad influence.

1107
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:07,361
Thanks, Tripper, for everything.

1108
01:25:08,136 --> 01:25:09,967
Goodbye, champ.

1109
01:25:13,007 --> 01:25:15,441
Go to bed! Yeah.

1110
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:20,841
Hey, look! <i>There's</i> Gerner!

1111
01:25:25,253 --> 01:25:29,314
- You wanna go to the final campfire?
- All right.

1112
01:25:31,493 --> 01:25:33,222
If I have to.

1113
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:40,230
- Hey, Tripper.
- Hey, you guys.

1114
01:25:40,335 --> 01:25:41,359
Hey, Trip.

1115
01:25:41,503 --> 01:25:42,993
Hi.

1116
01:25:45,707 --> 01:25:47,140
Eddy.

1117
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:50,575
I just wanna say thank you.

1118
01:25:50,712 --> 01:25:53,180
You've all been
a really terrific bunch of CITs,

1119
01:25:53,281 --> 01:25:55,977
and we've had...
All had a terrific summer,

1120
01:25:56,718 --> 01:26:00,586
except for a few minor incidents
that I <i>don't</i> wanna go into right now.

1121
01:26:00,722 --> 01:26:04,351
But, through it all, we share things,
and we become closer,

1122
01:26:04,459 --> 01:26:07,223
and that even makes it harder
to say goodbye,

1123
01:26:07,362 --> 01:26:09,023
but I hope you've learned a lot of things,

1124
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:12,065
I know I have, and I... I just wanna say,

1125
01:26:13,635 --> 01:26:16,001
I hope to see you all
again next summer.

1126
01:26:16,104 --> 01:26:18,299
Can I have some applause
for this man, please?

1127
01:26:18,406 --> 01:26:19,634
- All right!
- Come on!

1128
01:26:19,741 --> 01:26:21,902
Hey! Way to go, Mickey!

1129
01:26:22,577 --> 01:26:24,511
<i>Let's</i> hear it for Mickey!

1130
01:26:24,779 --> 01:26:26,679
- Hey!
- Hey!

1131
01:26:27,482 --> 01:26:29,074
- All right.
- Oh, lovely!

1132
01:26:32,587 --> 01:26:36,216
- Can you get this?
- No.

1133
01:26:36,324 --> 01:26:38,121
Yeah, well, <i>I'm</i> very close.

1134
01:26:38,259 --> 01:26:39,726
- Are you close?
- No.

1135
01:26:39,827 --> 01:26:41,055
I <i>can't</i> hold it.

1136
01:26:41,162 --> 01:26:45,462
I <i>can't</i> hold it any longer!
Stick your finger in my ear!

1137
01:26:46,234 --> 01:26:47,565
Help!

1138
01:26:52,807 --> 01:26:55,571
Hey, save enough for us, Tripper.

1139
01:26:55,843 --> 01:26:57,105
Morty.

1140
01:26:57,245 --> 01:26:58,803
No hard feelings?

1141
01:27:06,421 --> 01:27:13,054
<i>We are the CITs, so pity us</i>

1142

<i>The kids are brats, the food is hideous</i>

1143

<i>We're gonna smoke and drink</i>
<i>and fool around</i>

Here we go, you guys! <i>Let's</i> go!

1157
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:27,658
End of the summer. You happy?

1158
01:28:27,769 --> 01:28:29,964
- You ready?
- Okay. Okay.

1159
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:32,369
- There we are.
- Everybody there?

1160
01:28:42,216 --> 01:28:45,515
- Where will I stay?
- My place. Where do you think?

1161
01:28:46,554 --> 01:28:50,081
- Is it big enough?
- <i>It's</i> got a double bed.

<i>What's</i> the matter with you? <i>Haven't</i> you

No. Have you?

Pets, you know, a dog, a fish.
No, I haven't.

I've never asked anyone before.
