3
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,400
Admiral Yamamoto, please.

4
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,400
He asked not to be disturbed.
- It is most urgent.

5
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,800
Admiral Yamamoto? 

6
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,480
Tokyo has been bombed.
- When? 

7
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,720
10 minutes ago. Yokohama, Kawasaki
and Yokosuka were also bombed.

8
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,880
His lmperial Majesty is unharmed.
I personally phoned the palace.

9
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,720
Damage?  - Very little to Tokyo.
No reports from the other cities,

10
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,800
but it seems probable
that they too were barely scratched.

11
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,640
How did they do it, Watanabe? 

12
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,720
They launched long-range
B-25 bombers from their carriers.

13
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,840
They came in at treetop level,
and were first seen over the city.

14
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,040
Tokyo... bombed!

15
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,240
Sir, I understand your concern
for the Emperor's safety, but...

16
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,200
You may speak freely, Commander.
- This raid is a blessing in disguise.

17
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,640
The Americans have
proven you correct.

18
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,560
Our homeland is not invulnerable.
After today, the General Staff

19
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,120
will certainly approve
your operation M-l.

20
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,480
Lieutenant-Colonel Doolittle
led the raid with a force of 16 B-25s

21
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,920
and an all-volunteer crew of airmen.

22
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,920
Most of the planes carried
500-pound demolition bombs

23
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,200
and single incendiary clusters,

24
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,840
which were dropped on oil stores,
factories and military sites in Tokyo.

25
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,440
A few planes made minor strikes
on Kobe, Yokohama and Nagoya,

26
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,440
with one bomb hitting
the Japanese carrier Ryuko.

27
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,520
News of this raid has improved
American and allied morale,

28
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,760
while at the same time constituting
a blow to Japanese prestige.

29
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,320
Thanks, Sir.

30
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,160
At his press conference today,
President Roosevelt was asked:

31
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,680
""Can you tell us, where did
those planes start from and go to?""

32
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,040
He replied:
""Yes, the time has come to tell you.

33
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,160
They came from our new
secret base at Shangri-la...""

34
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,400
Well, my God, it's Captain Garth!

35
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,080
I was expecting some junior officer.
This is an unexpected honor!

36
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,880
Yeah, like hell it is, Joe!

37
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,840
Admiral Nimitz sent me over to...
- To chew my ass off, huh? 

38
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,800
Officially, I'm supposed to question
your estimate of Japanese intentions.

39
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,960
Why so grim, Matt?  Doolittle's attack
should've thrilled you CinCPAC people.

40
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,760
Not by a long shot.
That damn raid could boomerang on us.

41
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,600
We only got 4 carriers
in the Pacific. We need to rebuild.

42
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,200
Now the boss is afraid Yamamoto's
going to jump back at us. But where? 

43
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,640
We got the latest intercepts here.

44
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,080
Here's a list of Japanese ships

45
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,440
we suspect will be assigned
to amphib operations south of Rabaul.

46
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,480
The Coral Sea! That's where
we think they'll strike next.

47
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,720
But something else is stirring,
something out our way.

48
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,000
We need facts, not guesswork.

49
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,200
Matt, we cracked Yamamoto's code,
but we can't just reel it off.

50
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,800
We get a flicker here
and a glimmer there.

51
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,800
How much can you decipher? 
- Hell, 15, maybe...

52
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,920
Really decipher.
- Ten percent.

53
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,280
10 per... That's one word in 10.
For Christ's sake, you're guessing!

54
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,760
We like to call it ""analysis"".

55
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,760
Alright. What are these indications
that something's brewing out our way? 

56
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,240
There's no hard clues yet.
- What do you have, Joe? 

57
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,800
Increased radio traffic between
Yamamoto's commanders. - That's all? 

58
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,000
Could be significant. At least
I feel that something's stirring.

59
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,520
Alright,

60
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,840
I'll take that list of Jap ships
you ""feel"" are headed for Coral Sea.

61
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,120
Nimitz may send Fletcher's task force
to see what's going on.

62
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,040
We'll see how your 10-percent
guesswork pays off, huh? 

63
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,120
As a back-room code-cracker
I thank you, Matt.

64
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,800
Joe, could I ask you
something very personal?  - Certainly.

65
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,560
It really stinks down here.
How often do your people take a bath? 

66
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,480
Bath?  God, I don't know...
What day is it? 

67
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,960
Forget it, Joe.

68
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,480
Any new Yamamoto intercepts? 

69
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,600
Here's a first mention of ""A-F"",
whatever that means.

70
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,800
A-F? 

71
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,280
Captain!

72
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,560
Tom!

73
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,160
Dad...

74
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,080
My God, Tom.
When did you get in?  I didn't know...

75
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:46,360
Last night. - This is beautiful. Why
didn't you write that you were coming? 

76
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,800
I've been assigned to Kaneohe.
- Well, I'll finally see some of you.

77
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,400
Three years!

78
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,520
You look great, Tom.
- So do you, Dad.

79
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,320
Kaneohe, are you?  What squadron? 
- VF-8.

80
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,920
You'll like it. Your C.O. used to be
my wing-man on the old Langley.

81
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,920
Could we talk somewhere? 

82
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,760
Sure... Here.

83
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,240
I phoned you from Guam
the day you graduated.

84
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,360
Yeah, I heard later.
I'm sorry I missed the call.

85
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,480
I guess your mother was there? 

86
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,160
Yeah.
- How is she? 

87
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,800
Recovered from the divorce, I guess.
- That's good.

88
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,440
I was hoping maybe we could...
- Dad,

89
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:03,000
I've fallen in love with
a Japanese girl. I want to marry her.

90
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,320
I need your help.

91
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,480
I damn well guess you do, Tiger.

92
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,040
She's been arrested in Honolulu.

93
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,600
How did you manage that? 

94
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,240
In San Diego and getting mixed up
with a Japanese girl in Honolulu? 

95
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,440
She was a student in San Diego.
- And she was arrested here? 

96
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,440
Her parents live here. She wouldn't
marry me without their permission.

97
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,840
Apparently, the FBl has something
on her folks, so they got picked up.

98
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,480
Well, that figures.

99
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,480
Haruko was born here.
She's as loyal as you or me.

100
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,520
Anyway, the minute I got in I went
to see where they're being held.

101
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,720
She wouldn't see me.
- Why not? 

102
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,880
I don't know.

103
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:04,080
She and her parents will be sent
back to the mainland in a few days.

104
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,720
It sticks in your throat
that I want to marry a Japanese girl? 

105
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,280
Sticks in your...?  Don't give me
that ""racial bigot"" crap.

106
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,120
I don't care what color she is.
- It's not the point...

107
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,680
Christ almighty!

108
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,920
6 months after Pearl Harbor!
Boy, you have lousy timing.

109
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,520
What's her name? 
I'll see if I can get her FBl report.

110
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,680
I wrote it down for you:
Haruko Sakura.

111
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,040
But promise one thing:

112
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,720
Don't do anything stupid
till I see what I can get hold of.

113
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,640
That's a deal.

114
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:25,280
In my opinion, the plan is not only
unnecessary, but doomed to fail.

115
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,720
Admiral Kondo, Operation M-l
was conceived by our best strategist.

116
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:36,680
We are aware of Captain Kuroshima's
authorship and his reputation.

117
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,080
But this time, the god of operations
has conceived a monster.

118
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,600
Would you please explain? 

119
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,360
How am I expected to land
my invasion forces on Midway,

120
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,760
unless the enemy airfields and
shore batteries have been neutralized? 

121
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,320
Admiral Nagumo has said his carriers
will obliterate the American defenses.

122
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:03,280
The enemy's land-based bombers
have a range of 400 miles more

123
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,400
than Nagumo's carrier planes.

124
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,760
His ships would be blown out of
the sea before he launches his attack.

125
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:15,600
I destroyed the US fleet at Hawaii,
where the risk was far greater.

126
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,400
Where were the land-based bombers? 

127
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:24,240
A surprise attack with
a carrier task force is one thing.

128
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,880
But this, a strike
against Midway and the Aleutians

129
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,520
with 200 ships and 100,000 men.

130
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:40,760
Does the idea of taking the Aleutians
cause you concern, Hosogaya? 

131
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:48,760
No, Sir. But an operation so complex,
I'd like more time to study it.

132
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,200
After all, in a matter of hours
our Coral Sea operation begins.

133
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,040
We have sufficient forces for both.

134
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,040
I tend to agree
with Admirals Kondo and Hosogaya.

135
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,200
I suggest we meet again
after the Coral Sea campaign.

136
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,040
Very well.
- Gentlemen, consider this:

137
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,200
The Americans are still
unprepared and outnumbered.

138
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,480
If their fleet can be lured
into battle and defeated,

139
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,440
they will have no significant
naval force left in the Pacific.

140
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,880
They will have to sue for peace.

141
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,520
I have traveled widely in America,
my friends.

142
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,400
Their industrial might is awesome.

143
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:40,960
I'm convinced our only hope of victory
is one massive strike at Midway.

144
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,600
Joe, are you sure this
""hot information"" of yours can't wait? 

145
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,240
I already got one thing for the boss.
- I consider this urgent.

146
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,000
And, you were right about Coral Sea.
That's where the Japs were, alright.

147
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,720
Every ship on your list was there.
- Did we get hurt? 

148
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,080
We got hurt.

149
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,800
Welcome on, Admiral.
How was your flight? 

150
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,240
Long and full of potholes.

151
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,440
Got Fletcher's Coral Sea report? 
- Right here, Sir.

152
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,960
Get in back, Joe.
But wait till I cue you in.

153
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,360
Here's Admiral Fletcher's
preliminary report, Sir.

154
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,920
We lost the Lexington.

155
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,080
What about the enemy? 

156
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:15,600
We sank one light carrier, one big
first-line job and some small ships.

157
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,040
Looks like
we just about broke even, Admiral.

158
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,600
We can't trade the Japanese
carrier for carrier, Matt.

159
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,480
We started with a 3 to 1 superiority.

160
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,760
With the Lexington gone,
the Saratoga laid up,

161
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,920
all we've got is the Hornet,
the Enterprise and the Yorktown.

162
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:42,200
Sir, Yorktown was heavily damaged
at Coral Sea. There's the report.

163
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,640
Admiral, Commander Rochefort
has something urgent, he says.

164
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,120
It's about objective A-F,
the meaning of ""A-F"".

165
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:57,840
Our listening posts pick up traffic
between Yamamoto's flag commanders.

166
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,680
There's been a heavy traffic volume,
with references to object ""A-F""...

167
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,040
... and A-O. A-O is a mystery,
maybe a diversion.

168
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,640
But I think we've identified ""A-F"".
It's Midway.

169
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,440
It had us stymied until one of my men
remembered an intercept from March.

170
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,880
A Jap reconnaissance pilot radioed
his base that he's close to ""A-F"".

171
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,320
We plotted every course
the plane could have have taken,

172
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,320
and the only appreciable landmass
he could have flown over was Midway.

173
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,040
Joe! - I know it's thin.
- Thin?  Damn near invisible!

174
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,880
But I figured out
a way to confirm it, Sir.

175
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,960
If you have this flown to Midway.
It's a fake message, Admiral,

176
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,360
reporting that Midway's
freshwater condenser's broken down.

177
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:55,360
It should be transmitted in the clear,
so the Japanese get every word.

178
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,520
Instruct Midway to include this in
their housekeeping traffic tomorrow.

179
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,600
Aye-aye, Sir.

180
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,720
Send this right away.

181
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,320
Hey, chief!

182
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,000
What's this? 

183
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,000
There ain't nothin' wrong
with our freshwater condenser!

184
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,200
Dombrowski, send it.

185
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,920
Damn heat's gettin' to everybody here.

186
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,320
Have this intercept coded
and transmitted to fleet headquarters!

187
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,400
They took the bait, Admiral.
Rochefort just decoded a transmission

188
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,840
from Kwajalein
to Yamamoto's headquarters:

189
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,920
""A-F has trouble
with its freshwater condenser ""

190
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,760
""A-F"" has to be Midway lsland.

191
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,560
Be at my office at 05:00, Matt.
I'm calling in the whole staff.

192
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,120
This is how
I expect the battle to develop:

193
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,080
The northern force, under Hosogaya,
strikes the Aleutians as a diversion.

194
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,760
To keep Nimitz's attention
away from our main objective.

195
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,920
He will not realize
our objective is Midway

196
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,240
until 24 hours later, when
Nagumo's carriers strike the island

197
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,920
and destroy the American
planes and shore batteries.

198
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,680
At that hour you move in,
Kondo, with your invasion forces.

199
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,200
Nimitz will be forced to respond.
He'll commit the balance of his fleet,

200
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,720
most certainly his carriers,
to repel the invasion.

201
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,760
His carrier commander
will undoubtedly be Admiral Halsey.

202
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,800
I have studied his tactics
and I have studied the man.

203
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,320
Halsey is courageous,
tough-minded and not afraid of risks,

204
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,000
but we will turn
these strengths against him.

205
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,040
It will take Halsey's task force
at least 48 hours to reach Midway.

206
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,400
By that time, Nagumo, you'll have
crushed Midway and be waiting for him.

207
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,880
You'll have a better position,

208
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,960
and at least
a 2-to-1 superiority in carriers,

209
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,240
and 4 to 5 times
the number of screening vessels.

210
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:16,240
Assuming the American fleet is still
guarding Hawaii when we strike.

211
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,920
Nimitz is crippled
and on the defensive.

212
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,120
He must deploy his remaining strength
around his most valuable Pacific base.

213
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,480
I agree with Admiral Nagumo.

214
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,640
We must make certain
where the enemy fleet is.

215
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:35,280
I propose we send 2 flying boats
to French Frigate Shoals on the 29th.

216
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,120
We fuel them by tanker submarine and
fly them to Pearl Harbor on the 30th.

217
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,280
They then report whether or not
the American fleet is actually there.

218
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,040
A very wise precaution indeed.

219
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,960
We will call it ""Operation K"".
Does anyone have any other thoughts? 

220
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,760
Yes.

221
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,720
We can achieve a great victory,

222
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:03,200
providing Nimitz and Halsey
do exactly what you expect.

223
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,120
The Enterprise and the Hornet
are due in by sundown.

224
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,240
The rest of the task force
should be in by morning.

225
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,880
The Yorktown is more
severely damaged than we thought.

226
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,240
How soon can we dry-dock her? 

227
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:24,280
By the 17th, if a Jap sub
doesn't spot the oil she's trailing.

228
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,280
Admiral Fletcher
just radioed in with a repair list.

229
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,920
Tell the yard repairman I want
every workman he can get to board her.

230
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,640
That sharpshooter from Washington
just landed. Be here in 30 minutes.

231
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,440
Who did they send? 
- Captain Vinton Maddox.

232
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,160
Maddox. He's a damned scalp hunter!

233
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,960
See that he's thoroughly briefed,
and get Captain Garth up here.

234
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,280
Admiral,
why don't you let me handle it? 

235
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,120
No, he's entitled to a crack at me.
Phone that in.

236
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,200
Are those arming switches fixed? 
- No, we still got some damn snafu.

237
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,760
Get them working 100%, or rip them
out of all our SBDs. Is that clear? 

238
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,760
Yes, Sir.
- Get to it.

239
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,480
Sorry to drag you out of bed so early,
but it's our only chance to talk.

240
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,720
It's OK. Did you get the report? 
- Yup.

241
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,360
I've already read it.

242
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,000
Did you know your girl

243
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,640
belonged to those
Japanese patriotic organizations? 

244
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,680
I saw the magazines,
but I didn't know it was propaganda.

245
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,120
The Attorney General's office
says it's subversive.

246
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:53,440
And the FBl doesn't think she's
telling the truth about coming here.

247
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,120
You can't blame them for that.
- Sure I can! And I can clear it up!

248
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,320
You cool down
and let me handle this!

249
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,960
Tom, I don't have time to fool around.
Do you want me to help you or not? 

250
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,840
I guess I have no alternative,
do l, Sir? 

251
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,800
I guess you don't.

252
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,160
Captain Maddox, Admiral Nimitz.
- Great pleasure, Sir.

253
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,120
Should we get right to it, Captain? 
- Certainly, Admiral.

254
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,120
I'm sure you're aware of Washington's
opinion on this Midway invasion.

255
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,800
Yes. They think it's an enemy ruse.

256
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,760
An elaborate phony, Sir.
- Go on.

257
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,680
Could we speak in private? 
- If you'd feel more comfortable.

258
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:55,600
These enemy radio intercepts
your intelligence has accumulated...

259
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:00,880
Very detailed... - Too detailed.
Remember, just before December 7th? 

260
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,840
The fake Japanese messages.
- These could be carbon copies.

261
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:11,080
Washington's sure Yamamoto's
feeding you this to hide his plans.

262
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,920
Very definitely possible.

263
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,200
Well, then how can you insist...
- Because I believe it's factual.

264
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,200
I'm convinced
Yamamoto's target is Midway.

265
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,720
But if you're wrong, Admiral,

266
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,080
if you send our carriers
into a Japanese ambush,

267
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,000
the entire West Coast and Hawaii
will be open for invasion.

268
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,440
Fully aware of that, Captain.

269
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,240
You mean, the safe play
is to defend the home folks first? 

270
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,960
With respects, Admiral,
it's the smart play.

271
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,160
Captain, if we surprise the enemy,

272
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,840
catch him where he's not expecting us,

273
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,000
we can drive him back 3,000 miles.

274
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,960
And keep him pinned till we can
take him on in his own front yard.

275
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,000
My instructions were
to convey Washington's deep concern

276
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,280
over the safety
of the West Coast and Hawaii.

277
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,880
Is Washington ordering me
to defend Hawaii or the West Coast? 

278
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,880
No, Sir.

279
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,320
My orders were simply to consult.

280
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,040
No, Sir,
I have no such orders for you.

281
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:26,160
Commander Blake, send the fleet to
repel invasion. Target: Midway lsland.

282
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,760
Issue the order immediately.
- Aye-aye, Sir.

283
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,400
Admiral, may I see you a moment? 
- Excuse me, Captain.

284
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,560
Damn. You know how
Bill Halsey hates hospitals.

285
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Maybe it's nothing serious.
- To get him anywhere near a hospital

286
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,880
it must be not only damn serious,
it must be critical.

287
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,720
Admiral, I have some really bad news.
- Today's the day for it.

288
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:04,560
The Japanese changed the J-N 25 code,
the one they used for Yamamoto's plan.

289
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,720
How long do you need for the new code? 
- A month, maybe two.

290
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,240
Sir, do you still
want that fleet order issued? 

291
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,640
Yes. Target: Midway.

292
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,240
Welcome aboard your flagship, Admiral.

293
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,600
Thank you, Captain.

294
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:52,720
Rear Admiral Kusaka,
my Chief of Staff. Captain Aoki.

295
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,400
Where's Commander Genda? 

296
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,480
He's in sick bay, Admiral. Influenza.

297
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,800
When does the doctor think
he can resume his duties? 

298
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,560
In 2 or 3 days.

299
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,320
I don't like beginning this operation
without my best air commander.

300
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:13,920
We have another sick bay casualty:
Commander Fuchida has appendicitis.

301
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,120
Fuchida too? 

302
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,240
We'll need a replacement.

303
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,360
Genda suggests
a veteran torpedo pilot:

304
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,800
Lieutenant Tomonaga.

305
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,480
If Genda says so,
I want to see Tomonaga right away.

306
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,240
Yes, Sir.

307
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:41,120
Fuchida, the man who led
my first strike on Pearl Harbor, out.

308
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,040
Genda, who planned it, both ill.

309
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,680
Very bad luck, Sir, very bad luck.

310
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,440
Only an inconvenience, Sir.
We'll manage.

311
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,280
Good morning, Sir. - Lieutenant.
- Follow me, please.

312
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,600
Here we are. The Sakura family.

313
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:00,240
Yes. Thank you, Lieutenant.
I can find my own way out.

314
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,760
Miss Sakura,
I'm Captain Garth, Tom's father.

315
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,240
Please come in.

316
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,920
My parents, Tetsuro and Sada Sakura.
This is Captain Garth.

317
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,520
How do you do? 

318
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,000
You want to speak to me in private.
My parents understand.

319
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,360
Yes. Well, thank you.

320
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,000
If I embarrassed you, forgive me,

321
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:47,280
but I wanted you to see that they
are not a threat to national security.

322
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,200
I never really
thought they would be, Miss Sakura.

323
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,520
I suppose it goes with the times.

324
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,000
And I shouldn't be bitter? 

325
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,280
I never said that.

326
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,320
Damn it, I'm an American!

327
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,200
What makes us different from
German-Americans or ltalian-Americans? 

328
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,600
Pearl Harbor, I guess.

329
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,000
Look, I've read the FBl report.

330
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,800
Ask me anything you want to.

331
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,560
Alright.

332
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,760
Your father has been seen frequently
entering the Japanese consulate.

333
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,840
He has old friends there.

334
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,440
I see.

335
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,760
What about these
patriotic organizations you belong to? 

336
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,840
My father enrolled me in those
when I was born.

337
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,200
Out of respect for him
I never resigned, but I wasn't active.

338
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,320
I see.

339
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,760
What about those magazines
they found in your parents' apartment? 

340
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,440
The ""Prairie Shimbun""? 
Published in Wyoming.

341
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,280
My father has
deep emotional ties for Japan,

342
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,680
but even so he thought
it was a ridiculous propaganda sheet.

343
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,520
Why did he subscribe? 

344
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,920
He's a traditional and honorable man.

345
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,440
He was once indebted to the man
who publishes the ""Prairie Shimbun"".

346
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,880
Look, Miss Sakura,
I understand you came to Hawaii

347
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,480
to ask your parents' permission
to marry my son.

348
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,400
Yes, I did.

349
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,320
Why didn't you tell that to the FBl? 
- I didn't want to implicate Tom.

350
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,880
Why won't you see him? 
He's in love with you, he tells me.

351
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,640
You won't even talk to him.
He doesn't understand. I don't either.

352
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,680
Because my parents have
forbidden me to marry outside my race.

353
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,080
I want you to tell him for me.

354
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,960
I can't tell him that.

355
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,680
He wouldn't believe me.

356
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,840
Besides, I'd just as soon
he didn't know we'd talked together.

357
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,440
Look, Miss Sakura,

358
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,760
Haruko,

359
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,480
Tom's based
at Kaneohe Naval Air Station.

360
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,480
Send for him, please.

361
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:17,320
You have to tell him this.
You have to tell him.

362
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,760
Damn itching is driving me crazy!

363
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,760
All those medics can do is
smear this God-awful paste on it.

364
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,400
When they get the nerve to come near.
- I know I'm a bad patient.

365
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:10,360
But a skin disease! Of all the stupid,
useless things to get laid up with!

366
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,960
It's driving me nuts. I can't even
think! - We don't have much time.

367
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,640
Fletcher's docking the Yorktown now,
and I've got hard decisions to make.

368
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,240
Recommend your replacement.
- Ray Spruance.

369
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,160
I know he's junior
to a lot of other flag officers,

370
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,720
and never served a day on a carrier.
But Chet, he knows carrier tactics.

371
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,720
Well, you asked for my recommendation.

372
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,360
I can just picture
Washington's reaction

373
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,280
if I hand over the Hornet and
the Enterprise to a cruiser skipper.

374
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:54,120
Especially with the static I'm getting
for expecting the Japanese at Midway.

375
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,400
You told me once, Chet:
""When you're in command, command.""

376
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,000
Admiral Fletcher, Sir.
- Good morning, Sir.

377
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:09,680
Welcome home, Jack. Congratulations
on bringing your cripple in.

378
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:14,160
Well, we got lucky. - We haven't got
much time, so I'll make this fast.

379
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,640
Halsey's beached, in the hospital.
Won't be leaving for a while.

380
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:25,400
I'm sending you out again, Jack,
in 72 hours. In full combat readiness.

381
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:30,360
That's impossible! It'll be 3 months
before the Yorktown's in commission.

382
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,920
Spruance has replaced Halsey. He takes
Hornet and Enterprise to sea tomorrow.

383
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,800
You follow him 48 hours later.

384
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,000
Spruance is a cruiser commander!
- He knows carrier tactics.

385
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,800
Yeah, but he can't fly.
- Neither can you.

386
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,560
And he sure as hell
can't learn it by tomorrow, can he? 

387
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,600
No.

388
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,200
Congratulations, Ray.
- Well, I'm still in a state of shock.

389
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,560
Nice seeing you again, Matt.
How's the hand?  - Coming fine, Sir.

390
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,960
We could have used you at Coral Sea.

391
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,560
He's on your Air Operations staff
on the Yorktown.

392
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,040
Good.

393
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:15,520
We face the biggest force the enemy
has ever sortied, over 200 ships.

394
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,720
They've got 4-to-1 supremacy.

395
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,760
Yamamoto himself is commanding.

396
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:25,320
We know when
and from where he's going to sail,

397
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,400
we know their original courses.

398
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:33,200
We don't know their rendezvous point,
course changes or when they'll strike.

399
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:39,200
They could hit from the northwest,
but intelligence doesn't support that.

400
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,320
Ray, assuming
this isn't just an elaborate ruse,

401
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,000
Washington thinks it is,
but assuming they're wrong,

402
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,400
what kind of move do you suggest? 

403
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:59,400
Well, I'd take my carriers here,
to a point northeast of Midway,

404
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,120
and wait for Nagumo's carriers.

405
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,520
Why not head northwest
and hit them head-on? 

406
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,320
There's a chance
Washington may be right.

407
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,760
You think Hawaii and the West Coast
could be the real target? 

408
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:17,560
It doesn't really matter, provided
I'm in a position to cut them off.

409
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,040
If it's Midway, I'll bushwhack them.

410
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,400
Alright. Jack, you're senior. You take
command when you join up. - Yes, Sir.

411
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:31,040
The Yorktown will be at sea
in less than 72 hours.

412
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:36,200
I don't need to stress that Yamamoto
outweighs us in every department.

413
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,640
Our 3 carriers are all that stands
between the enemy fleet and our coast.

414
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,640
Now, your point of rendezvous,
what should we call it? 

415
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,520
""Point Luck"", Sir.

416
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,880
Sounds like a prayer,
but it's damned appropriate.

417
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,480
Son of a bitch!

418
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,280
Nurse!

419
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,240
Ray.
- Hi, Bill.

420
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,520
Wanted to call the nurse
to have that tree cut down.

421
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,520
It spoils my view of the boatyard.

422
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,560
Feeling OK? 

423
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,840
I can't sleep. I can't eat.
I just sit and scratch 24 hours a day.

424
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,400
You ever try an oatmeal
and water bath?  Don't.

425
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,280
I want to thank you for recommending
me to take your place.

426
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,960
I have a question:

427
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,520
Did that itch go to your head? 

428
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,600
Stop underestimating yourself.

429
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,120
Any skipper who can keep
his cruisers and destroyers

430
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,720
alongside my carriers across the whole
Pacific is the man for the job.

431
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,480
You know, you and l...

432
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,040
Bill, we're kind of different.

433
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,480
You think I can do it as well as you? 

434
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,840
I can only tell you this, Ray:

435
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,600
You play it the way you feel it,
not the way you think I'd play it.

436
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,280
You go to sea, find Yamamoto and
chew his ass. Nothing more to it.

437
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,080
Christ, no! You want to catch this? 
We'd lose the God-damned war!

438
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,280
Oh, by the way,

439
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,360
I'll have somebody cut down
that tree for you. - Yeah.

440
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,520
In carrying out the task
assigned in Op-Plan 29/42,

441
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,920
Enterprise and Hornet will act
on the principle of calculated risk,

442
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:58,280
which means avoiding exposure
to attack by superior enemy forces

443
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:04,320
without good prospect of inflicting
greater damage to the enemy.

444
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,280
Sir, three boilers
are out of commission.

445
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,920
The yard manager says
he needs another two days.

446
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:47,680
Delaney, I expect the yard
to finish the job by 06:00 tomorrow.

447
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,680
Sorry about your boiler, Jack.

448
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,440
But if you clear Pearl by 07:00

449
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,800
you'll rendezvous with Enterprise
and Hornet on schedule.

450
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,520
Agreed.
- Good luck, good hunting. - Thanks.

451
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,520
You too, Matt. See you back here soon.

452
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,680
We just haven't any future, Tom.

453
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,360
I figured that's what it was.

454
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,720
We don't.

455
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,760
We really don't.

456
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,440
I wish you'd go now.

457
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:28,200
I don't love you anymore.
It was a mistake.

458
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,880
Say it to my face.

459
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,800
say it to my face, God damn it!

460
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,000
It'll be OK.

461
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,320
Shit. Wait and see!

462
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,960
1919, the Marines were practicing
dive-bombing off Haiti.

463
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,800
Everybody said:
""Premature, wait and see.""

464
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,480
We waited, then the Germans
showed us in '37 in Madrid.

465
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,480
You mean like at Pearl Harbor? 
- Pearl Harbor, shit!

466
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:21,160
In '32 it was proved that Pearl Harbor
could be attacked from the air.

467
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:25,560
And Admiral Ramsey predicted
it would happen, in detail.

468
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,760
When was that? 
- 1937, pal.

469
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,400
Wait and see. We waited.

470
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,840
December 7th, we saw.

471
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,240
The wait-and-seers
will bust your ass every time.

472
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,360
I'll drink to that.
- Bet your...

473
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:48,040
How long have you been here? 
- Long enough to hear your lecture.

474
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,080
You ought to go on the radio.
How the hell are you? 

475
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,400
Alright... Well, I'm celebrating
my birthday. That's how I am.

476
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,840
That's a problem
we all have once a year.

477
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,960
My God,
now you got my kid flying for you.

478
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,520
How's the boy doing? 
- Just fine.

479
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:09,000
He's a good pilot. Got him in an F4F.
He'll be shipping out any day.

480
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,280
Coming from you that means a lot.

481
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:18,040
No. He's good man, a natural pilot,
good attitude, good marksman.

482
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:24,600
Tom's only deficiency
would be in enemy identification.

483
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,040
He's got to learn, you don't win a war
by kissing the enemy.

484
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,040
For Christ's sake... - Well, he told
the whole God-damned squadron.

485
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,960
I met her. She seems like a nice girl.
- So is Madame Butterfly.

486
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,240
She's having trouble with him.
- Now you're having trouble seeing.

487
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,840
I've got to shove off.

488
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:51,560
Scuttlebutt says you're going out
on the Yorktown. - That's right.

489
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,680
Well, keep your dumb ass
out of drafts. - That's right, buddy.

490
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,440
Thanks for keeping an eye on my boy.
I appreciate it.

491
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,240
He'll be fine, Matt.

492
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,200
Tom! - Nice of you
to take the time to see me off, Dad.

493
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,880
But your squadron isn't due to ship
for a week. Why are you boarding? 

494
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,840
Are you saying you're surprised, Sir? 
Your buddy Jessop transferred me.

495
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,120
I didn't know anything about it!
- Like hell you didn't!

496
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:33,200
You wanted me shipped out,
to stop me from doing anything stupid!

497
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:37,760
So your old buddy Jessop obliged.
- Tom, I knew nothing about it!

498
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,360
I have to report on board, Sir.

499
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,480
MARlNE lNTELLlGENCE

500
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,760
OK, Sir.

501
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:12,880
Captain Garth is here, Sir.
- Great. Come in, Matt. How are you? 

502
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:18,720
I'm gonna do something I don't do,
at least not since Annapolis.

503
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:25,000
I'm gonna ask you to do me a favor.
- Ask away! Lord knows I owe you some.

504
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:31,200
This is an FBl enemy alien report.
- Where did you get this? 

505
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,800
Don't ask.

506
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:36,280
Matt, I could find out.
- Don't, Harry.

507
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:45,480
The report contains all the bureau
has on... - A Japanese? 

508
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:50,640
On an American citizen
named Haruko Sakura und her parents.

509
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,680
They look OK to me,
but I'm not in your business.

510
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,960
It sounds like you are.

511
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,600
Harry, I want you
to investigate this personally.

512
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,800
They'll be sent
to the mainland next week.

513
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,280
If they're clean,
and I'm betting they are,

514
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,520
I want that shipment cancelled.

515
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,400
Matt, you're way out of line here!
This isn't your department!

516
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,120
This is tampering!

517
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,560
Alright, what have we got? 

518
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,560
What are these people to you? 

519
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,920
Someday,
the girl may be my daughter-in-law.

520
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:42,440
You're pressuring me to take
improper action for personal reasons.

521
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,120
Improper action, hell!

522
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,480
They're no more
a threat to national security

523
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,080
than your pet Airedale.

524
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:57,960
I'll have to report your request.
It'll go into your record.

525
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,640
It's not for me.

526
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:05,640
You know I wouldn't ask you
for myself. I'm asking you for my kid.

527
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,040
Jesus Christ, Harry!

528
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,760
I'm begging you!

529
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,600
Alright, I'll investigate it.

530
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,480
Thanks, Harry.

531
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,640
And, Captain,

532
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,360
this'll wash it with us.

533
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,160
We're even.
- Aye-aye, Sir.

534
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,600
Captain? 

535
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,360
Thank you, Corporal.

536
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,600
Reporting as ordered, Sir.

537
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:09,320
Sorry to send the Marines after you,
but you didn't answer my messages.

538
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,920
We had nothing to talk about, Captain.

539
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,720
You can cut out that midshipman-crap,
you're talking to your old man.

540
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,960
I'll try to remember it.

541
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:24,080
I'd like to set the record straight:
Before we left Pearl,

542
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:28,640
I personally vouched
for Haruko and her parents,

543
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,120
and went way out on a limb for them.

544
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:34,200
I didn't know
what weight it would carry,

545
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,840
but you know, there it is.

546
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,440
Thanks.

547
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,280
One more thing:

548
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,240
I didn't ask your C.O.
to ship you out.

549
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,360
You spoke to him, didn't you? 
- Yes, I did.

550
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,320
He asked me how I felt about...
- Haruko and me, right? 

551
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,920
If you couldn't do anything about it,
why couldn't you leave it alone? 

552
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,240
Jessop thought
he was doing us both a favor.

553
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,760
I did all I could,
and a lot more than I should've.

554
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,200
You're paid to fly fighter planes,

555
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,720
not to sit in your cabin
and cry over your girl's picture.

556
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:15,400
You better shape up, Tiger, before
a hot-shot Jap pilot flames your ass!

557
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,440
Just received this message, Sir.

558
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,440
Operation K, the reconnaissance flight
to Pearl Harbor, has been cancelled.

559
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,120
Cancelled?  Why? 

560
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,800
Our scout planes couldn't refuel.
An enemy vessel was there.

561
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,520
Sir, Admiral Nagumo's carrier force
should be warned immediately.

562
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:53,720
Admiral Nagumo must have picked up
the transmission when we did.

563
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,240
Suppose he didn't.

564
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,760
He will assume the American carriers
are at Pearl Harbor.

565
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,400
And that is where our latest
intelligence reports place them.

566
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,320
What latest intelligence reports? 

567
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,200
Have any of our submarines sighted
the US fleet in the last 20 hours? 

568
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:16,920
No, Sir. But there's no logical reason
for them to move their carriers.

569
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:21,960
We must not break radio silence and
risk letting them know our location.

570
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:28,440
The element of surprise is one of the
most important aspects of our attack.

571
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,680
Admiral, this is our search plan.

572
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,640
An air search involving 22 PBYs,

573
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:54,600
each plane flying 700 miles out,
covering an 8-degree sector.

574
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,720
We'll have a 180-degree view
at anything coming from the west,

575
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,400
and still have a flanking area
northeast of Midway for our carriers.

576
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,960
Have it put into operation right away.
- Aye-aye, Sir.

577
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,440
Jesus, how many of those can you eat? 

578
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,520
Admiral, air reconnaissance report.

579
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,760
No sightings.

580
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:01,720
Is there any defense measure
we've overlooked? 

581
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,120
That had top priority, Admiral.

582
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:09,840
You sent everything we had:
tanks, PT boats, anti-aircraft guns.

583
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:15,080
It's miserable waiting for an attack
on your own people, hoping it happens.

584
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,360
More pressure from Washington? 
- Not a whisper.

585
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,480
Frankly,
I'd rather have them raising hell.

586
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,720
Captain.
- What's the count, Reid? 

587
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,640
Half a dozen F4Fs and 15 Buffaloes.

588
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:50,280
Damned relics. - We'll show the Japs
we're up here. Maybe we'll get lucky.

589
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,200
OK, Reid.

590
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:11,240
In less than 5 hours
Hosogaya will attack the Aleutians,

591
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:15,640
and we will still be groping to Midway
in this filthy squall.

592
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:19,840
We're not due to launch
our first air strike for 36 hours.

593
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,960
Our predictions are for clear weather
before then, Admiral.

594
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:27,600
I keep wondering what Operation K
uncovered at Pearl Harbor.

595
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,080
Were the American carriers there? 

596
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:36,320
We've heard nothing from Yamamoto.
The American carriers must be there.

597
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:41,320
Damn communications blackout!

598
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,680
Hey, you guys!
The Japs are bombing Dutch Harbor!

599
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,160
Here we go.

600
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,560
Well, Gentlemen, it's started.
Signal Spruance.

601
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,040
The Aleutian lslands
are being invaded, Admiral.

602
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:29,760
Washington could still be right.

603
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:34,840
It could be a feint for an attack
on the West Coast or here in Hawaii.

604
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,920
Or what we've defended against.

605
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:41,480
Today. Our PBY should tell us today.

606
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,120
Hey, do you see what I see? 

607
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,720
Damn right, I do!

608
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:16,480
Sparks, raise Midway.
Radio: Main body.

609
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:20,120
That's all?  Just ""Main body""? 
- Send it! - Yes, Sir.

610
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:27,520
An American PBY, Sir.
A reconnaissance seaplane!

611
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:33,160
Radio's picked up it's transmission.
It's alerting Midway.

612
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,000
Break radio silence.

613
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,760
Advise Admiral Yamamoto:
lnvasion force has been discovered.

614
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:47,400
6 large ships in a column, bearing
262 degrees, distance 700 miles.

615
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:55,000
Admiral.
- You were right, it's Midway.

616
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,240
Enigma!

617
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:02,120
You know what I mean, Admiral.
- Fletcher's joined Spruance on time.

618
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,600
Another one from Strawberry-9, Sir.

619
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:11,960
11 ships, course 090, speed 19 knots.

620
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,440
Just what kind of ships? 

621
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:19,040
First transmission said ""Main body"",
but didn't mention carriers.

622
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:25,480
That PBY, Strawberry-9,
was at the end of his 700-mile leg.

623
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,080
Nagumo's carriers could be
following the large ships.

624
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,320
Maybe beyond his horizon.

625
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,160
If they are, Fletcher's too far north.

626
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:39,960
He has to move at top speed now to get
within striking distance by sunset.

627
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,560
But if Nagumo's carriers are
coming in behind the storm front...

628
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,200
Fletcher'd be caught
between two forces.

629
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:49,960
Yes, if we let him head
for that main body sighting.

630
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,760
Send a flash message to Fletcher:
This is not, repeat, NOT main body.

631
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,000
Expect enemy carrier strike
tomorrow behind storm front...

632
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:06,680
... via northwest, as anticipated.
Signed, Nimitz.

633
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:13,160
CinCPAC must think the PBY
sighted only Kondo's invasion force.

634
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,800
But if it's Nagumo's attack force
with its carriers,

635
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:20,440
and its scouts find us
before we find them...

636
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,280
Sound general quarters!

637
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:44,760
Weather is clearing, Admiral.
We could not have timed it better.

638
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:49,600
We intercepted a radio transmission
from Tokyo to Admiral Yamamoto.

639
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:56,000
Intelligence does not report
any movement of the American fleet.

640
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:59,720
Whatever doubts we may have had...
- They still are with me, Kusaka.

641
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:04,120
We have no definitive intelligence
reports, only opinions and estimates.

642
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:07,560
And Yamamoto's silence
does not make them a fact.

643
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,120
Admiral.
- Genda.

644
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:19,560
My apologies. I've been
away from my duties much too long.

645
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,720
Genda, how are you? 

646
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:28,040
I'm well enough
to take charge of air operations.

647
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,800
And so you shall, my friend.

648
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:37,000
Prepare an air search plan right away.
- For what area? 

649
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:42,160
Where I would deploy my carriers
if I were an American commander.

650
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:46,880
There, northeast of Midway.

651
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:57,200
Times like this,
Joe, I miss the flatlands.

652
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:03,720
It's a big body of water out there.
I'm a fella from the Texas prairie.

653
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,320
Nearest lake was 120 miles away.

654
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,560
You could wade across it
at the height of the rainy season.

655
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,560
During summer
we made clay pots out of its bottom.

656
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:22,920
Whatever happens, Joe, you sure
as hell earned your pay this month.

657
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Well, thank you, Sir.

658
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:32,680
To cover the area, we will launch
scout planes from Akagi and Kaga,

659
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:36,120
and our cruiser escorts
will launch 5 seaplanes.

660
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:40,480
Very good. And until our scouts
have searched the area,

661
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:44,560
we'll hold our most experienced pilots
and half our aircraft in reserve.

662
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,280
But the American fleet

663
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:50,960
can't be anywhere near Midway. We
shouldn't hold back our best pilots.

664
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,640
We've been over this before.

665
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,680
Admiral,
our first strike must be decisive.

666
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:03,280
If we don't destroy Midway's airstrip
and planes, we invite a counterstrike.

667
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,360
Commander Genda? 

668
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:11,360
I agree with you, Sir.

669
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:14,040
Let our younger pilots
fly the first strike.

670
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:19,440
I am sure they can do the job.
If not, we can launch a second strike.

671
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,920
That is how it will be.

672
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:30,000
Suddenly, the man who led us
to victory at Pearl Harbor

673
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:32,480
is choked by caution.

674
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,280
He senses danger out there.

675
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,960
So do l.

676
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:43,560
Their transports wouldn't be so close
if they didn't plan to invade soon.

677
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,200
CinCPAC's right.
They'll hit Midway today.

678
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:49,480
Yes, but from where? 
He could pop out anywhere.

679
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:54,720
And then his scout planes will be out.
- We have to find him first.

680
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,720
If he hits our blind side...

681
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:03,240
Why don't we get some eyes out there? 
10 SBDs will cover our northern flank.

682
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,600
OK. But no more than 100 miles out.

683
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:10,640
I want to recover them fast,
in case the PBYs make contact first.

684
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:39,040
You OK? 
- Yeah. - Here.

685
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:45,880
The poor bastards'll miss all the fun.
There's nothing north of us but ocean.

686
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:49,240
He gets his dope straight
from Tokyo Rose. Right, Chili Bean? 

687
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:53,480
Wrong, from here.
When it bristles there's Japs around.

688
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,840
You're crazy!

689
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:01,200
'Morning, Captain. - You're supposed
to be sacked out. What're you doing? 

690
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,080
We couldn't sleep.

691
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:10,120
I know, but get below and try.
We got a heavy day ahead.

692
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:13,680
Yes, Sir.

693
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,280
Excellent weather forecast.

694
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:47,440
Broken cloud cover up to 2,000 feet
to conceal us from enemy scout planes,

695
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:52,640
and above unlimited visibility
straight into Midway for our flyers.

696
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,960
Commence launching.

697
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:38,160
All our cruisers' scout planes
are in the air, except one.

698
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,080
The Tone is having catapult problems.

699
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:44,920
A delay in launching scout 4.
- How long? 

700
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,640
Half an hour, Sir.

701
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:50,360
In case the Americans suddenly appear,

702
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:54,840
I suggest bringing the 2nd flight wave
on deck as soon as the 1st is clear.

703
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:59,600
Armed with torpedoes
to deal with enemy carriers?  - Yes.

704
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,560
Our planes and the Kaga's.

705
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,280
Soryu and Hiryu can stand by
with bombs for Midway.

706
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,320
Give the order.
- Yes, Sir.

707
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,720
Now it's up to our strike leader.

708
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,560
Tomonaga is the best we've got.

709
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:18,440
Howie? 

710
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,080
It's the whole damn Jap navy!

711
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:36,480
Radio, raise Midway.
Send: Enemy carriers.

712
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:44,360
We got 'em! It's Jap fighter cover.
- Let's duck into the clouds.

713
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,840
""Enemy carriers""?  That's all? 

714
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:03,720
That's all Strawberry-5 said.
We haven't heard from him since.

715
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:09,520
If he was on course and on schedule,
he made the contact about here,

716
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,200
250 miles out.

717
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:15,200
You better signal it to Spruance.
- Aye-aye, Sir.

718
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,320
You certain it was Strawberry-5? 

719
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,200
Positive, Skipper.

720
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:36,400
How far are we
from that contact point? 

721
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:38,360
We're 15 minutes behind schedule.

722
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:42,640
Bandits! Sweet mother of God,
hundreds! - Where, damn it? 

723
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:46,360
Four... no, five o'clock!

724
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:50,080
Jesus!

725
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:58,360
Billy, send this quick:
Many planes heading Midway.

726
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,560
Are you certain? 

727
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Alright, just let us know
the second you get anything else.

728
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:07,920
Nothing more. No word from our scouts
since that ""Many planes"" flash.

729
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:12,680
Yes, but was that from Strawberry-5? 
- No call letters were sent.

730
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,120
Maybe he was jumped
by enemy fighters.

731
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:21,080
Damn it! How many carriers? 
What course?  What speed? 

732
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,360
Those Japs
will never find us in this soup.

733
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:30,480
And we'll never find their carriers
unless we break into the clear.

734
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:34,000
Damn it!
I should've risked going straight in.

735
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:45,240
Nothin'. We've lost 'em!

736
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:51,440
Lieutenant, they're behind us!
I see 2 carriers and a battleship.

737
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:54,320
Send it!
- Aye-aye, Sir.

738
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:08,080
""Fletcher to Spruance. Second
sighting reported, Strawberry-5:

739
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:12,680
2 enemy carriers, battleship.
Bearing: Midway, 320 degrees.

740
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:17,320
Distance: 180 miles.
Course: 135 degrees.

741
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:20,040
Speed: 25 knots.""

742
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,520
Came right out of the slot
where Nimitz figured.

743
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:26,400
""Proceed southwesterly,
attack enemy carriers.

744
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:29,800
Will follow as soon as
search planes recovered. Fletcher ""

745
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:33,080
Signal ""Ahoy"", Captain Browning.

746
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:35,840
To battle stations.

747
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:11,320
Get the control tower.

748
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,640
Andy, Major Parks get his fighters up? 

749
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:20,280
All 23. The SBDs are ready to go.

750
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:22,520
Get 'em airborne.
- Yes, Sir.

751
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:26,200
Captain, we've got
Major Parks' frequency.

752
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,120
Rainbow Leader.
Below us, 10 o'clock.

753
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:37,880
I see 'em, Kirk.
Alright, everybody.

754
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:41,080
Let's see how many
we can drop on the first pass.

755
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,480
Two bogies under you!

756
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:59,840
Got one! Look at that Jap bastard!

757
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:05,760
Get him off me!

758
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:12,920
On your tail!
Comin' in on you!

759
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:19,000
I'm hit, Rainbow Leader!
My God! Mayday, mayday!

760
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:22,640
Look out, Rainbow! On your tail!

761
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:25,440
Comin' in on you! Three of 'em!

762
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,800
Look at that Jap bastard!

763
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:44,320
My God, they got Major Parks!
Look out! Two bogies, four o'clock!

764
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,720
Rainbow Leader, come in!
This is Noah's Ark.

765
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:51,680
Report please!
What is your condition?  Report!

766
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:53,920
Good God!

767
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,480
Give me the tower.

768
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,560
Andy, they blew
right through Parks' fighters!

769
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,280
Get your people under shelter!

770
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:20,920
Jesus!

771
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:22,960
Come on!

772
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:31,960
Attack in squadron order!

773
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:55,400
God, they creamed us!
- But we're not out of action yet.

774
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:58,320
Our landing strip's still operational.

775
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,520
Tomonaga
is asking for a second strike.

776
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:35,800
Sir, this report is a great victory.
We've lost only 7 planes.

777
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:40,080
We've destroyed 40 enemy aircraft,
in the air and on the ground.

778
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:44,880
But the pilots you chose
did not destroy the airstrip.

779
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:49,880
We have 93 planes and our best pilots
waiting on our flight decks.

780
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,440
The entire force should be sent now.

781
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:58,200
The entire force?  Our planes are armed
with torpedoes on Genda's advice.

782
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:01,520
Hardly suitable for bombing
an airstrip. Correct, Commander? 

783
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:05,280
They should be immediately
rearmed with bombs below deck.

784
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:10,320
We must make certain
that Midway can mount no air attacks.

785
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:14,360
Lieutenant Tomonaga's request
is also a warning.

786
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,800
Midway is still a threat to us.

787
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,360
So are the American carriers.

788
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:21,640
If they are nearby, yes.

789
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:24,800
But after 2 hours,
our scouts have reported nothing.

790
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:28,840
You're forgetting, scout number 4
was a half-hour late taking off.

791
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:32,800
It will not reach it's maximum
search range for another hour.

792
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:45,160
Tomonaga's planes
will be returning soon.

793
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:49,760
They can be quickly refueled
and rearmed for sea action.

794
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:54,320
In case our scouts
sight any enemy ships.

795
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:56,200
Admiral? 

796
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,240
Very well.

797
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:04,280
Order our torpedo bombers
to be rearmed with contact bombs.

798
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:09,480
As soon as they are ready,
we will launch a 2nd strike on Midway.

799
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,360
57 planes on the line, Sir.

800
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:46,920
The Hornet will probably
launch about the same number.

801
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,960
What's the enemy carriers' position? 
- 135 miles, Sir.

802
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:56,400
If we launch immediately,
do our pilots have enough fuel? 

803
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:59,160
Yes, Sir. If the weather holds,

804
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,840
they navigate perfectly and
aren't over the target too long.

805
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:08,480
If we launch now, we might
catch Nagumo like a sitting duck.

806
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:13,920
If we wait, it will give him time
to refuel and reload.

807
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:17,240
Sir, the PBY reported only 2 carriers.

808
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:20,440
I know.
- lntelligence says he has 4.

809
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:24,760
If those other 2 suddenly pop up...
- Then we'd be sitting ducks.

810
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:33,040
But we have 2 certain targets
135 miles away that don't expect it.

811
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:40,560
Let's get Enterprise
and Hornet turned into the wind.

812
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:46,920
It's from Admiral Spruance.

813
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:52,200
Enterprise and Hornet are launching
every aircraft they've got.

814
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:04,640
Air controller reports our strike
force will be over the deck in 1 hour.

815
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:08,760
Just the time we need to finish
arming our bombers for the 2nd strike.

816
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:12,240
Your confidence
is most reassuring, Kusaka.

817
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:17,880
Our scouts report no enemy carriers.
They've started their homeward leg.

818
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:22,600
All except scout number 4.

819
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:43,080
10 enemy ships sighted.

820
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:50,280
Bearing: 010 degrees. Distance: 240
miles from Midway. Speed: 20 knots.

821
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:54,200
Which scout radioed the contact? 
- Number 4, Sir.

822
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:00,000
How far along are we on rearming? 
- Almost half, Sir.

823
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:02,040
Order it halted.

824
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:06,960
Radio scout 4 to ascertain
ship types and maintain contact.

825
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:19,000
Friendlies, Sir.
Our search planes returning.

826
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:22,640
They'll be on board
in under 15 minutes.

827
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:25,200
Have Captain Buckmaster see to it.

828
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:30,840
Our planes from Enterprise and Hornet
should hit the Jap carriers in 1 hour.

829
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:34,200
They're not on the same course? 

830
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:37,080
We're counting on it, Admiral.

831
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:42,640
Nagumo has to hold course
until he recovers his planes.

832
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:47,320
240 degrees puts our people on him
with unfueled aircraft on his decks.

833
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:05,600
I don't see our fighters, Sir.
They should've caught up to us by now.

834
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:07,480
And where's Bombing 8? 

835
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,560
With Fighting 8.
They took off together.

836
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:14,120
Ain't they supposed to be with us? 

837
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:19,000
Red Fox Leader to Kit 3.

838
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:22,160
Red Fox Leader to Kit 3!

839
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:25,440
Either my compass is fouled up,
or we're not heading 240.

840
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:31,400
There's nothing out there.
I know where the Japs are, Mr. Gay.

841
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:35,040
Will you tell us, Sir? 

842
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:40,840
I figure they moved east
since we launched, away from Midway.

843
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:47,440
Roger. - What good's our orders,
if the skipper's gonna lead us off? 

844
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:49,080
I don't like it.

845
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,440
Take it easy.

846
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:56,640
If anybody can find the Japs,
Waldron can. He's part Sioux lndian!

847
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,840
Sir, another message from scout 4.

848
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:13,560
3 additional enemy ships sighted, 250
miles from Midway. Speed: 20 knots.

849
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,280
Apparently 2 cruisers,
a carrier believed to be the Yorktown.

850
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:22,360
Impossible. The Yorktown was
virtually destroyed at Coral Sea.

851
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:26,200
They can't have repaired her
and brought her here in 10 days.

852
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:28,800
We must assume they have!

853
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:31,600
If it is it,
we must destroy her at once.

854
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,360
I see.

855
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,000
Suddenly, the threat
from Midway's bombers seems

856
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:42,560
Iess to you than when you urged me
to rearm our planes with bombs!

857
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,640
Admiral, Midway must wait.

858
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:48,920
We should rearm our bombers
and attack that carrier.

859
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,880
Back to torpedoes again? 

860
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:57,440
More wasted time! - Tomonaga,
this is Genda. Do you read me? 

861
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:03,320
Lieutenant Tomonaga,
this is Commander Genda.

862
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:07,080
Do you read me? 
- I read you, Sir. - Report please.

863
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:12,520
Request permission to land. My pilots
report almost empty fuel tanks.

864
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:17,240
Some have taken anti-aircraft hits.
Urgent we land immediately, Sir.

865
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,800
Do I have permission? 

866
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:24,520
Admiral Yamaguchi advises
that we attack the enemy carrier and

867
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,120
Iaunch our bombers at once,
however they're armed.

868
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:31,120
While we're launching, Sir, Tomonaga's
pilots will crash into the sea!

869
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:34,680
They're running out of fuel, Admiral.

870
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:43,160
Alright.

871
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:47,280
Wait until we've recovered
all our airborne aircraft.

872
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:52,400
While they are landing on the deck,
rearm our bomber with torpedoes.

873
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:55,120
Then we'll attack the enemy carrier.

874
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:10,400
That's the last of our scouts, Sir.

875
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:14,800
Tell Eliot to launch all we've got.
- Aye-aye, Sir.

876
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:25,120
Pilots, man your planes!

877
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:55,880
Admiral, all aircraft now on board.

878
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:59,560
Tomonaga? 
- He was the last to touch down.

879
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:06,080
I want to close range on the enemy
carrier. Steer northeast. Full speed!

880
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:18,800
From Admiral Nagumo:

881
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:22,840
""Enemy force composed of
1 carrier, 5 cruisers, 5 destroyers,

882
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:26,080
sighted 250 miles from Midway.
We are headed for it.""

883
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:27,920
One carrier? 

884
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:33,240
Close to Midway. Not Pearl Harbor!

885
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:39,160
Admiral Nagumo will simply destroy it
a few days earlier than planned.

886
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:46,200
Oh, thanks, Matt.

887
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:49,320
I'd give my retirement pay
to know what Nagumo's doing.

888
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:53,520
The same thing we are, Admiral,
sweating it out.

889
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:06,320
Skipper!

890
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:13,400
I see it.

891
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:18,880
What'd I tell you, Huntington? 
The skipper can smell them out.

892
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:26,200
See if you can raise Bombing 8
and Fighting 8. They must be near.

893
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:29,320
Better coordinate the attack.
- Yes, Sir.

894
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:34,720
Red Fox 8 Leader to Badger 8 Leader!

895
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:38,120
Red Fox 8 Leader to Badger 8 Leader!
Do you read me? 

896
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:43,760
OK, we can't wait all day.
You better get ready, Dobs.

897
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:46,400
Red Fox Leader to Kits,
we're going in!

898
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:51,320
Divisions 2 and 4, take the carrier.
Divisions 1 and 3, ram the escorts.

899
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:57,640
And stay together as long as you can.
I say again: stay in tight!

900
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:15,440
Admiral, enemy torpedo bombers
off port quarter!

901
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:30,120
They're coming in
without fighter protection.

902
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:32,720
Mindless suicide!

903
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:35,840
Perhaps.
But it's an effective technique.

904
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:39,720
We can't attack their carrier
while we're busy dodging them.

905
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:41,840
They're using up all our fighters.

906
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:46,080
Bandits, 11 o'clock! Look out!

907
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:48,760
Two of them. Shoot, shoot!

908
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:56,480
This is Kit 6, I got 3 of them
on my tail. Somebody help me!

909
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:09,680
Below you, bandits! No, no!

910
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:14,600
Oh God damn! No!

911
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:27,800
Stay in formation!

912
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:32,240
Get in. Close up, you idiots!
They'll jump us to pieces!

913
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:34,400
I'm hit, I'm hit! Oh, Jesus!

914
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:43,120
Dobs, behind you! Bandits behind you!

915
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:44,800
Look out!

916
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:51,720
Huntington, coming in at 10 o'clock!

917
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:02,000
Huntington!

918
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:04,880
Huntington, are you dead? 

919
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:09,920
Follow me.

920
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:31,040
Waldron, get your nose up!

921
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:35,400
Pull up, pull up!

922
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:33,920
What happened? 
- One of our torpedo groups attacked.

923
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:37,640
Yeah, but which one? 
What the hell happened? 

924
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:44,160
Casualty report, Sir:
One of our fighters took a minor hit,

925
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:48,040
no shipboard damage, no casualties.

926
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:57,600
A whole squadron. 15 brave crews.

927
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:19,160
Torpedo 3 going in at 1,500 feet.

928
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:22,240
Bombing 3 and Fighting 3 at 1,900.
15 minutes to target.

929
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:26,400
Who's coordinating the attack? 
- Max Leslie. He's leading Bombing 3.

930
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:43,360
Helen Leader to Helen group:
Time to arm your bombs.

931
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:46,680
I say again: Arm bombs!

932
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:52,360
God damn it!

933
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,880
Don't touch
that damned electric arming switch!

934
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:01,000
Use manual control!

935
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:05,120
Too late, Commander. Mine dropped.
- Mine dropped too.

936
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:08,120
Rotten gadget! Who the hell
invented the electric arming switch? 

937
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:12,880
Yamamoto, who else?  Now what? 
Should we drop spitballs on the Japs? 

938
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:16,640
Alright, knock it off.
The rest, use manual control!

939
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:19,920
Helen Leader, out.

940
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:47,680
Skipper, look at Chili Bean over here!

941
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:51,320
I feel them!

942
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:53,920
Hope he's right.

943
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:08,200
Bertha 3 Leader to Mabel 3 Leader,

944
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:12,280
Bertha 3 Leader to Mabel 3 Leader:
Japs on the horizon!

945
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:17,040
I got 3...
Sweet Jesus, I got 4 Jap carriers!

946
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:21,640
Holy hell, we hit the jackpot!

947
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:30,640
Yes, sky watch? 
- Enemy torpedo planes! - How many? 

948
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:33,480
Two separate groups.

949
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:43,360
Bertha 3 Leader to Mabel 3 Leader:
How's about it?  You boys ready? 

950
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:47,440
Damn right, we're ready!
Let's go, we're running out of fuel!

951
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:50,360
Roger. Bertha 3 Leader to Small Fry:

952
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:55,120
Concentrate on the closest flattop.
Push in close and get hits!

953
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:58,360
I count 12
coming in from starboard, Admiral.

954
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:00,560
14 from port side, Sir!

955
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,560
All these can't be from one carrier.

956
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:07,680
They must be coming from Midway.
- Or a second carrier.

957
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:12,120
We've heard nothing from scout 4 since
it sighted the one enemy carrier.

958
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:14,520
Soryu should send out its scout plane.

959
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:18,120
We must make certain
of what we're up against.

960
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:20,840
See to it immediately.
- Yes, Sir.

961
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:36,360
Lining up to jump us, Thach.
About 12 Japs.

962
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:41,200
We're right above them.
Mabel 3 to Hustlers: Break 'em up!

963
01:35:59,640 --> 01:36:03,760
Score 1 for Commander Thach!
Bogy! Comin' in on you, 3 of 'em!

964
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:10,560
That a boy, Tom!
Run that bastard into the drink!

965
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:16,720
Ramos, 2 o'clock!

966
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:25,680
Nice shootin'!

967
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:33,840
More comin' in at 1 o'clock!

968
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:41,760
You got him! Nice goin'!

969
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:51,960
Mabel 3 Leader to Hustler Tom:
3 bandits at 12 o'clock divin' on you!

970
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,760
Roll out, Tom! Dive, dive!

971
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:24,880
We've quashed all of their attacks,
and not one torpedo has come close.

972
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:28,600
Sacrifice themselves like samurai,
these Americans.

973
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:34,000
That last attack pulled our entire
fighter cover down to sea level.

974
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:36,760
Now they're looking for survivors.

975
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:40,200
We have no fighter umbrella over us? 
- No, Sir.

976
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:44,200
We're trying to recall them,
get them back up to patrol altitude.

977
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:49,000
How many fighters are standing by
to cover our attack on that carrier? 

978
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:51,640
Barely enough to do the job.

979
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:19,400
They're American carriers,
no doubt about it, Yorktown class.

980
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:22,280
Get through
to Nagumo's flagship. Be quick!

981
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:30,480
Why are you waiting? 

982
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:33,960
The transmitter isn't working.
We're not sending out any signal!

983
01:38:48,640 --> 01:38:50,400
What's it look like down there? 

984
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:56,000
A Jap destroyer!

985
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,800
Going someplace
in one hell of a hurry.

986
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:06,440
OK, follow it. See where it leads us.

987
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:11,240
Commander McClusky, look at
the fuel gauge. We have to turn back.

988
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:13,640
I know, I know.

989
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:24,680
The last two attacks were made
by over 50 torpedo planes. 50!

990
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:28,480
There is more than one
enemy carrier nearby. There must be!

991
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:32,040
Admiral. - Genda, why hasn't
the Soryu's scout plane reported? 

992
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:35,800
We don't know. It should have sighted
the American ships 10 minutes ago.

993
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:40,000
Sir, all the bombers
are rearmed and ready.

994
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:48,400
Signal all carriers:
Launch immediately!

995
01:39:56,560 --> 01:40:01,560
There they are, dead ahead.
Sweet mother, look at them!

996
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:06,800
Huey, the whole Jap navy!
- Pipe down till I report contact!

997
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:10,520
Raven Leader to Mother Goose:

998
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:14,240
Have them in sight.
4 enemy carriers.

999
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:18,640
I say again: 4 enemy carriers.

1000
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:32,360
Helen Leader to Mabel and Bertha!

1001
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:34,760
Come in Bertha, come in Mabel!

1002
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:40,840
This is Helen Leader. We have contact.
Come in Bertha, come in Mabel!

1003
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:46,400
I'm sorry, Commander Leslie,
Torpedo 3 and Fighting 3 don't answer.

1004
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:50,440
Keep trying. We're supposed to
coordinate our attack.

1005
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:55,640
Either their navigation is fouled up
or this is the wrong rendezvous point.

1006
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:57,840
Keep trying, damn it!

1007
01:40:58,280 --> 01:41:00,120
Mabel Leader, come in!

1008
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:08,920
Raven Leader to flock: They're turning
into the wind, preparing to launch.

1009
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:11,920
I don't see any Jap fighters, Sir.

1010
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,960
Let's not wait for 'em! Fall in!

1011
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:22,720
It's no use. Commander Massey
and Commander Thach don't answer.

1012
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:25,280
OK, hang on. We're going in.

1013
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:30,120
Sir, we don't have a bomb! - We can
draw some heat off the guys that do.

1014
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:35,160
This is Helen Leader. Concentrate
on that big bastard up forward.

1015
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:39,120
Commander McClusky, they've got
bombs all over their flight deck!

1016
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:41,480
Bull's eye!

1017
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:51,200
Scratch one flattop! Caught him cold!

1018
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:55,920
Raven Leader to Raven 6.
I got a hit, Commander McClusky.

1019
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:59,440
Bring it home, girls, bring it home!

1020
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:06,360
Bull's eye!

1021
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:14,160
Commander, I got a hit!
Look at that bastard burn!

1022
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:17,000
Beautiful, Helen 3, dead center!

1023
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:34,800
We caught 'em flat-footed!
No fighters and a deck full of bombs!

1024
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:37,800
Sweet Mary, how did we get so lucky? 

1025
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:08,240
Helen Leader to squadron:
3 enemy carriers burning.

1026
01:44:08,680 --> 01:44:10,520
Time to go home.

1027
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:50,160
Admiral, you must transfer your flag.

1028
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:53,000
The cruiser Nagara is close by.

1029
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:58,080
Advise Admiral Yamaguchi.

1030
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:06,120
I can't tell you where to find the
enemy carriers, Lieutenant Kobayashi.

1031
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:10,400
Their last position was radioed
by scout 4 several hours ago.

1032
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:14,600
Hasn't the Soryu scout reported, Sir? 
- It hasn't been heard from.

1033
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:21,080
Then how do I find them, Sir? 
- Fly to their last reported position.

1034
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:25,400
Then just trust your luck
that somehow you will find them.

1035
01:45:37,480 --> 01:45:42,720
Do you hear anything?  - Nothing.
All enemy frequencies are silent.

1036
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:52,360
Lieutenant, enemy planes!
- I see them.

1037
01:45:57,200 --> 01:45:59,120
Our fighters
are forming for an attack!

1038
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:05,760
Signal them to lay back with us.
- Lay back... - Stay off the radio!

1039
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:09,760
We'll let them
lead us to their carrier.

1040
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:24,400
I got all Max Leslie's bombers, Sir.
- Where's the rest of Thach's planes? 

1041
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:26,120
Off the port quarter, Sir.

1042
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:37,000
I'll bring the fighters down first.
They'll be the lowest on fuel.

1043
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:39,960
Jesus!

1044
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,840
He's alive, Captain.

1045
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:01,760
Flight Mission Combat!
- Go ahead.

1046
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:07,360
Radar has more aircraft, bandits.
020 degrees, 30 miles and approaching.

1047
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:11,800
Roger. Bandits, Sir.
020 degrees, approaching, 30 miles.

1048
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:14,760
Sound general quarters!

1049
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:56,800
We took a bomb hit to the side.
The boilers are out.

1050
01:49:58,440 --> 01:50:01,880
Admiral, the radio's down. We can't
send visual signals in this smoke.

1051
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:05,160
You better transfer the flag, Sir.
I suggest to the Astoria.

1052
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:09,760
Matt, you better stay aboard,
help Murray with the flight ops.

1053
01:50:11,640 --> 01:50:14,480
Lower the barge.
- Have the Admiral's barge lowered!

1054
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:26,080
This is Zephyr calling Whirlwind:
Enemy carrier on fire!

1055
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:30,720
I repeat: Enemy carrier on fire.
Returning to base.

1056
01:50:31,160 --> 01:50:36,320
That wasn't Kobayashi. - None
of the senior officers survived.

1057
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:40,720
The scout plane from the Soryu
is approaching. His radio is out.

1058
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:50,160
He's gonna be OK, Captain.
- We'll transfer him in half an hour.

1059
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:11,520
Hi, Dad.

1060
01:51:14,720 --> 01:51:17,280
I'll see you back at Pearl, Tom.

1061
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:25,640
There's a picture of Haruko and me
that I'd like you to bring ashore.

1062
01:51:27,640 --> 01:51:29,360
I'll take care of it, Tiger.

1063
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:36,560
Thanks, Dad.

1064
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:48,360
Only 1 boiler in use, Sir. 5 are out.
- Can you get 'em on the line again? 

1065
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:53,240
Yes, Sir. I think I can guarantee
you 15 knots in an hour.

1066
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:58,400
Very good. Delaney, tell your gang
the topside fires are under control.

1067
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:00,360
Aye-aye, Sir.

1068
01:52:02,440 --> 01:52:06,160
Matt, we have more planes than pilots.
Can you fly one for me? 

1069
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:07,880
Sure.

1070
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,320
MARlNE lNTELLlGENCE

1071
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:18,680
Did you confirm it? 
- Yes, Sir. Fletcher's reply is here.

1072
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:22,840
""Fletcher to Nimitz: Confirm
1st report, 3 enemy carriers afire.""

1073
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:24,440
Hallelujah!

1074
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:30,600
3 of their 1st-line carriers, Admiral!
Isn't that worth a ""hot-diggity-damn""? 

1075
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:35,120
Good advice, Joe, but there's still
that 4th enemy carrier to deal with.

1076
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:38,920
A message from Captain Buckmaster:
The Yorktown's been hit.

1077
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:43,320
Badly?  - Yes, but she's underway.
- Operational? 

1078
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:48,720
Our whole force may be in jeopardy
if the Japanese locate the Yorktown.

1079
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:51,440
They still have a tremendous fleet.

1080
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:54,640
But that 4th carrier can't be far off.

1081
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:59,320
We've already won a great victory,
Admiral.

1082
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:03,640
Maybe we should get our people back.
- Break off, run for home? 

1083
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:06,440
Before they can hurt us again?  Yes.

1084
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:12,280
That may be the smart play.

1085
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:16,760
Trouble is: I want that 4th carrier!

1086
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:33,640
What's wrong? 
- Your right wing tank is punctured.

1087
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:38,400
We haven't had time to repair it.
- Is the left tank fueled?  - Yes, Sir.

1088
01:53:39,120 --> 01:53:42,040
A few hours ago
we filled the sky with our planes.

1089
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:47,600
Now we win or lose
with 6 fighters and 10 torpedo planes.

1090
01:53:55,640 --> 01:53:59,720
The skipper wants to know, can you
maintain this speed?  - 18 knots.

1091
01:54:00,160 --> 01:54:04,160
Very good. - All we gotta do
is find that 4th Jap flattop.

1092
01:54:04,600 --> 01:54:06,680
Bridge-phone, Combat.
- Go ahead, Combat.

1093
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:11,280
Report from Scouting 5.
Adams located the 4th enemy flattop.

1094
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:14,800
Good. Relay our position to Fletcher.

1095
01:54:15,240 --> 01:54:19,040
We found him, Delaney. Just give us
all the old lady's got left.

1096
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:23,160
Sir, radar has bandits.
Distance: 35 miles, closing.

1097
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:28,120
They're coming in low.
- Torpedoes! - Sound general quarters!

1098
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:31,160
Let's get everything airborne
while we still can.

1099
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:35,080
General quarters!
Man all battle stations!

1100
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:54,640
Right 4 rudder!
- Aye-aye!

1101
01:56:11,920 --> 01:56:14,640
Watch out! Get down!

1102
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:25,080
Whirlwind, this is Zephyr 3!
Two torpedoes hit the carrier!

1103
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:29,320
I repeat: Two torpedoes
hit the carrier! Returning to base.

1104
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:33,520
Now it's one against one, Admiral.
Congratulations.

1105
01:57:37,360 --> 01:57:39,840
Delaney, what's the situation below? 

1106
01:57:40,280 --> 01:57:42,720
No good. All boilers are out.

1107
01:57:43,160 --> 01:57:46,800
Get your people topside, fast!
- Aye-aye, Sir.

1108
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:54,400
Larry, radio Enterprise:
We'll land there after our bomb run.

1109
01:57:54,840 --> 01:57:58,400
Yes, Sir.
Blue Leader to all planes...

1110
01:58:01,160 --> 01:58:03,800
How many are we sending out? 
- 24 dive-bombers.

1111
01:58:04,240 --> 01:58:07,320
We'll have to try it
without fighter protection.

1112
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:10,040
What about the Hornet? 
- Scraping the bottom of the barrel.

1113
01:58:10,480 --> 01:58:15,880
16 dive-bombers left, and Matt Garth
is bringing 3 from the Yorktown.

1114
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:20,400
Signal the Hornet:
We attack immediately. - Aye-aye, Sir.

1115
01:59:26,520 --> 01:59:28,880
That wasn't the carrier
Kobayashi dive-bombed.

1116
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:32,440
She was undamaged.
We put 2 torpedoes into it.

1117
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:36,720
Kobayashi said the carrier was
on fire. Did you see any smoke? 

1118
01:59:37,160 --> 01:59:40,600
No, Sir, it must have sunk.
We didn't see a 3rd carrier, either.

1119
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:43,520
Dive alert! Enemy dive-bombers!

1120
02:01:00,080 --> 02:01:03,120
Sir, we must withdraw.

1121
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:08,400
How will we apologize to His Majesty? 

1122
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:10,560
Leave that to me.

1123
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:17,360
I am the only one
who must apologize to His Majesty.

1124
02:01:32,920 --> 02:01:34,080
Thank you.

1125
02:01:35,400 --> 02:01:38,200
That was the LSO, Sir.
Matt Garth is coming in.

1126
02:01:38,640 --> 02:01:40,480
His plane is all shot up.

1127
02:03:11,880 --> 02:03:15,760
I wonder if Matt knew how big we won.

1128
02:03:16,200 --> 02:03:18,440
I think I know what he'd have said:

1129
02:03:20,120 --> 02:03:22,960
""lt doesn't make any sense, Admiral.

1130
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:25,040
Yamamoto had everything going for him,

1131
02:03:25,480 --> 02:03:28,920
power, experience, confidence...

1132
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:35,320
Were we better than the Japanese,
or just luckier?""
