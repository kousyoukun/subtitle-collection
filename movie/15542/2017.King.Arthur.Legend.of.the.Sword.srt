3
00:01:28,036 --> 00:01:33,026
幾個世紀以來人們和巫師和平共處
For centuries man & mage lived together in harmony

4
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:38,013
黑暗巫師莫德雷德的出現打破了這種平靜
until the rise of the mage sorcerer Mordred

5
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,084
人類成為了他邪惡野心的受害者
turning his dark ambition against man

6
00:01:44,012 --> 00:01:50,033
他正在向卡美洛進軍，那是人類的最後一座要塞
He marches on the last remaining stronghold Camelot

7
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,075
烏瑟，這場戰爭我們沒勝算的
Uther, I don't think we can win this fight.

8
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:56,012
我瞭解莫德雷德，他會接受我們的投降
I know Mordred. He would accept surrender.

9
00:02:56,018 --> 00:02:57,028
拿著王冠
Hold the crown.

10
00:02:59,058 --> 00:03:00,089
拿穩了
And hold it steady.

11
00:03:56,034 --> 00:03:58,061
沖啊！幹掉他們！
Drink their blood!

12
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:04,002
戰鬥吧！
War!

13
00:06:06,054 --> 00:06:09,034
大家別忘了，在莫德雷德出現之前
Let us not forget that before Mordred,

14
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:12,061
我們和法師們相處和睦
the Mages lived among us in harmony.

15
00:06:12,068 --> 00:06:16,008
我們之間從未起過任何衝突
Our relationship with them was always peaceful.

16
00:06:16,015 --> 00:06:18,022
直到一部分法師受到了黑暗力量的蠱惑
That was before they tasted power

17
00:06:18,028 --> 00:06:20,005
製造出猛獸，發動了這場戰爭
and produced those creatures of war.

18
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,095
錯的是他們的首領莫德雷德，而不是普通人民
But it was only Mordred, not his people.

19
00:06:23,002 --> 00:06:25,022
伏提庚，為什麼你要將所有的法師趕盡殺絕呢？
So why are we slaughtering them, Vortigern?

20
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:27,036
難道王子殿下不會同情那些法師?？
Was not the prince friendly with the Mages at one time?

21
00:06:27,043 --> 00:06:29,033
我聽說他和莫德雷德相處過一段時間啊
Did he not study with Mordred himself?

22
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,043
你想表達什麼？
What are you implying?

23
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:34,046
我是受我父親之命出使
I was sent to study with him by my father,

24
00:06:34,053 --> 00:06:36,010
目的是鞏固我們和法師之間的外交關係
as a token of diplomacy.

25
00:06:36,017 --> 00:06:38,057
我們只想提醒陛下
We would only seek to remind Your Majesty

26
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:42,077
那把擊敗莫德雷德的聖劍，是一位名叫梅林的法師給您的
that it was a Mage, Merlin, who gave you the great sword.

27
00:06:42,084 --> 00:06:44,088
準備！
Light!

28
00:06:44,094 --> 00:06:47,041
要是沒有梅林和善良的法師們給予我們的幫助，我們還能贏得這場戰爭?？
Where would we be without Merlin and the Mages who helped him?

29
00:06:47,048 --> 00:06:49,098
那他們人去哪了？為什麼他們不現身呢？
Where are they now? Why do they not show themselves?

30
00:06:50,005 --> 00:06:52,032
麥西亞閣下，想必您肯定知道
You know where they are, Lord Mercia.

31
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:53,098
他們怕受到牽連，銷聲匿跡了
They are running for their lives!

32
00:06:53,098 --> 00:06:54,075
別吵了！
Enough!

33
00:06:54,082 --> 00:06:56,022
放箭！
Loose!

34
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:58,006
不會再有殺戮了
There will be no more killings.

35
00:06:58,012 --> 00:07:01,039
戰爭已經結束了，弟弟，聽明白了?？
There will be no more purges. Am I clear, brother?

36
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,040
散會
Now leave me.

37
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,088
這樣的和平能持久?？
Peace?

38
00:07:25,002 --> 00:07:26,082
至少能有短暫的和平
For a while.

39
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:31,006
是不是我們再來晚點，你們就要打起來了？
Have we arrived in time to save you from each other?

40
00:07:31,012 --> 00:07:33,023
只有你才能拯救我啊
The only person I need saving from is you.

41
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:36,029
我可不是來救你的，我是來接兒子的
I came for the child, not you.

42
00:07:36,036 --> 00:07:38,073
你可不能把我的寶貝搶走嘍
Then you'll have to fight me for him.

43
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,080
我弟弟今天不太舒服
My brother's not himself today.

44
00:07:40,087 --> 00:07:43,030
好好照顧他，明天見
Look after him. I'll see you tomorrow.

45
00:08:10,013 --> 00:08:11,093
他們準備好了?
Are the men ready?

46
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,046
都準備好了
Yes, they are.

47
00:08:16,017 --> 00:08:18,047
大人，您確定要這麼幹麼
Are you sure about this, My Lord?

48
00:08:24,098 --> 00:08:28,095
我的妻子，醒醒，我要你按我說的做
Listen to me, woman. I need you to do as I tell you.

49
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:30,065
發生什麼了？
What's going on?

50
00:08:30,071 --> 00:08:32,035
快起來，我們帶上兒子一起走
I need to get you and the boy away from here.

51
00:08:32,042 --> 00:08:34,022
我會儘快跟你們會合
And I'll join you as soon as I can.

52
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:35,055
烏瑟，我很害怕
I'm scared, Uther.

53
00:08:35,062 --> 00:08:38,092
別擔心，這把劍會保護我們，我們快走
I have the sword. Hurry.

54
00:08:39,096 --> 00:08:42,029
親愛的，這裡是什麼地方
How do you know of this place, my love?

55
00:08:43,036 --> 00:08:45,063
我們這是要去哪？
You must tell me where we're going.

56
00:08:47,097 --> 00:08:49,027
為什麼你不說話啊
Why do you not answer me?

57
00:08:59,098 --> 00:09:02,038
我們到這下麵來乾什麼
Tell me what we're doing down here.

58
00:09:12,032 --> 00:09:14,099
親愛的，告訴我，這是怎麼回事
My darling, tell me what it is.

59
00:09:24,007 --> 00:09:26,000
告訴我，發生什麼了，我們一起想辦法
Tell me what it is, and I'll make it stop.

60
00:09:29,044 --> 00:09:30,071
沒事的
It's okay.

61
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:18,026
解開纜繩
Untie the skiff.

62
00:10:44,045 --> 00:10:53,017
亞瑟王·鬥獸爭霸
翻譯：william2568

63
00:11:21,021 --> 00:11:24,007
倫底紐姆（今倫敦）
Londinium

64
00:12:59,055 --> 00:13:01,089
伏提庚王萬歲！
King Vortigern!

65
00:13:04,022 --> 00:13:05,056
別擋道！
Move!

66
00:13:08,043 --> 00:13:09,063
嘿
Hey!

67
00:13:31,032 --> 00:13:33,039
抓住他！
Come here!

68
00:14:07,095 --> 00:14:09,059
來啊！一個能打的都沒有！
Come on! Come on!

69
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,082
快跑，兒子！
Run, son!

70
00:15:56,046 --> 00:15:57,093
國王來了，讓開
Step aside for the king.

71
00:16:25,062 --> 00:16:27,006
讓他們回去工作
Get them back to work.

72
00:16:27,012 --> 00:16:28,006
是，陛下
Sire.

73
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:33,043
士官長，維持秩序！
Sergeant! Get them under manners!

74
00:17:20,068 --> 00:17:23,071
陛下，您還是這麼英姿颯爽啊
Still so handsome, my king.

75
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:26,035
水位怎麼下降了
Why has the water dropped?

76
00:17:26,042 --> 00:17:29,002
為什麼聖劍又現身了
Why does the sword reveal itself now?

77
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:33,009
我還沒準備好，塔樓尚未完工
I'm not ready, the tower is not complete.

78
00:17:33,016 --> 00:17:37,086
在您的勢力增長的同時，反抗勢力也在積聚力量
As your power increases, so, too, do the forces that will oppose you.

79
00:17:37,093 --> 00:17:42,047
均衡之律不可破
Balance is a law that cannot be transgressed.

80
00:17:42,053 --> 00:17:45,037
合法繼承人將要回歸
The born king will come.

81
00:17:45,044 --> 00:17:48,017
這是無可避免的
It is inevitable.

82
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:51,021
我們說好了的
We had a deal.

83
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,051
當我摯愛之人的鮮血染紅這池中之水
When the blood of a loved one is spilt in these waters,

84
00:17:55,011 --> 00:17:56,045
我的欲望就能得到滿足
my desire must be met.

85
00:17:56,051 --> 00:17:59,052
的確如此，國王
There is no ambiguity, My Lord.

86
00:17:59,058 --> 00:18:01,072
我的承諾已經兌現了
We kept our side of the covenant.

87
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:04,069
而您呢，您沒抓住那個孩子，那把聖劍您也沒搞到手
It was you who lost the boy, and the sword.

88
00:18:04,076 --> 00:18:06,026
我犧牲的還不夠多麼？
Have I not sacrificed enough?

89
00:18:06,032 --> 00:18:08,069
難道您的力量沒有增長?
And have you not felt your power increase?

90
00:18:08,076 --> 00:18:12,073
一個又一個王國臣服在你的腳下，您修建的高塔一層一層逐漸升高
With every kingdom conquered, with every level added to your tower.

91
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,067
當您用產自高盧(現法國)的白銀裝飾塔頂
When it is capped with the silver from Gaul,

92
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:18,017
您會得到你想要的一切
you will have what you wanted.

93
00:18:20,054 --> 00:18:22,041
找到那個男孩
Find the boy.

94
00:18:22,047 --> 00:18:23,081
殺掉他
Kill him.

95
00:18:23,088 --> 00:18:27,041
您就能掌控聖劍之力
And the sword will answer only to you.

96
00:18:27,048 --> 00:18:30,035
如果還需要我助您一臂之力
If you desire further help,

97
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,068
您清楚所要付出的代價的
you know the price.

98
00:18:38,002 --> 00:18:40,049
今天早上偶然遇到了那幫維京人
Bumped into the Vikings this morning.

99
00:18:40,056 --> 00:18:42,089
他們堅持要我把這個帶給你
They insisted I give you this

100
00:18:43,076 --> 00:18:46,056
還有，他們向你表示深深的歉意
with their deepest apologies.

101
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,070
用這些錢，好好照顧自己
Get yourself well.

102
00:18:51,077 --> 00:18:53,040
亞瑟，你犯不著趟這渾水的
This wasn't your responsibility, Arthur.

103
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:55,047
別說傻話
Don't be silly.

104
00:18:55,054 --> 00:18:57,058
我的小時候你們很關照我
You girls have looked after me for a lot longer than

105
00:18:57,058 --> 00:18:58,058
而我原來沒幫到你們什麼
I've looked after you.

106
00:18:58,064 --> 00:19:00,038
現在我要報答你們了
I owe you everything.

107
00:19:02,045 --> 00:19:03,091
你笑什麼呢
What's so funny?

108
00:19:03,098 --> 00:19:06,032
我想知道你是怎麼從那幫人手上搞到錢的
I just wanna know how you get money out of Vikings.

109
00:19:07,088 --> 00:19:09,072
直接開口問他們要就好了啊
You ask them for it.

110
00:19:11,015 --> 00:19:13,009
快開門！
Open the door!

111
00:19:13,015 --> 00:19:14,009
嘿
Hey.

112
00:19:14,016 --> 00:19:16,003
我們奉吾王之命搜查這裡，快開門！
Open in the name of the king!

113
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:18,026
把門打開
Open it.

114
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,053
各位有何貴幹？
Yes, gentlemen?

115
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,013
有一個反叛分子往這個方向逃了，我們要挨家挨戶的搜
A turner come down this way. We're searching all houses.

116
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,077
喲喲喲，新兵蛋子們，別亂來
Whoa. Slow down, new boy, before you trip up.

117
00:19:25,084 --> 00:19:28,000
你說什麼？
What did you say?

118
00:19:28,007 --> 00:19:29,097
我們可不是好惹的，你的這隻手不想要了是吧
I'm gonna take your hands for that.

119
00:19:30,004 --> 00:19:31,021
軍士長！
Sergeant!

120
00:19:33,008 --> 00:19:36,008
我不是跟你說過了?，別在這撒野
What did I tell you about this establishment?

121
00:19:36,015 --> 00:19:37,018
長官，是他先碰我的
He touched me, sir.

122
00:19:37,025 --> 00:19:39,002
那麼這是你運氣好，只是碰了你一下
Well, you should count yourself lucky.

123
00:19:39,008 --> 00:19:41,049
換成其他人的話，只怕會被打殘嘍
Most people have to pay for that.

124
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:44,066
帶上你手下的人，滾出去
Now take your terriers and get out!

125
00:19:49,016 --> 00:19:50,076
您就是“傑克之眼”吧，久仰您的大名啊
Jack's Eye.

126
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,096
發生什麼事了？
What did he want in here?

127
00:19:53,003 --> 00:19:55,067
反抗勢力又開始活躍起來了
Resistance are on the move again.

128
00:19:55,073 --> 00:19:58,004
前不久他們在河的上游襲擊了我們的一艘船
Hit a branding barge upriver.

129
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:02,077
最近你有見過新面孔?？
Anyone in the house you don't know?

130
00:20:02,084 --> 00:20:05,091
傑克，這很難說啊，我們這是風月場所，人來人往的
Well, I'm not sure, Jack. People come and go.

131
00:20:05,098 --> 00:20:07,095
不過你放心，我們肯定不會跟那些叛亂分子同流合污的
But we don't fall that side.

132
00:20:08,001 --> 00:20:10,005
我姑且相信你，不過，這也只是你的一面之詞啊
Ah, well, that's as may be.

133
00:20:11,071 --> 00:20:13,028
我們會將這些叛亂分子趕盡殺絕
Well, they fall where they fall.

134
00:20:13,035 --> 00:20:16,065
這個所謂的“合法繼承人”肯定不是什麼好兆頭
This "born king" bollocks isn't good for anyone.

135
00:20:16,072 --> 00:20:18,012
我帶人搜查一下，可以吧？
Mind if I take a look?

136
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:21,093
他受了傷，正在流血
He's bleeding.

137
00:20:23,066 --> 00:20:26,033
逃走的時候中了一箭
Took an arrow on the way out.

138
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,007
話說那個如果你們抓到了那個襲擊船隻的人，他會有什麼下場？
What would happen to a man who hits the king's barge upriver?

139
00:20:30,013 --> 00:20:31,087
你應該知道吧，那他有的罪受了
Well, you know what would happen.

140
00:20:34,014 --> 00:20:36,021
先是嚴刑拷打，然後再處決
And it doesn't happen quickly.

141
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:38,054
如果有人窩藏他呢，那會有什麼後果
What would happen to the people harboring such a man?

142
00:20:38,061 --> 00:20:41,048
他們將受到同樣的懲罰
Well, they get treated the same as the man they hide.

143
00:20:41,055 --> 00:20:43,008
是?
Would they, now?

144
00:20:45,075 --> 00:20:48,055
那邊的老哥，看樣子你在這不太受歡迎啊
Not sure you're too welcome here, mate.

145
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,033
他們會好好待你的，不用擔心
You're in safe hands now, no need to worry.

146
00:21:03,037 --> 00:21:05,043
我們到後面的房間談談，快
In the back room, now.

147
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,017
傑克，怎麼了，為何這麼緊張？
What's this all about, Jack? What's it got to do with us?

148
00:21:08,024 --> 00:21:10,044
你真的不認識這家伙？
Do you have any idea who that man is?

149
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:12,084
我也很驚訝，他是大人物?，我居然不認識
For a man who's so popular, I'm surprised I don't.

150
00:21:12,091 --> 00:21:14,031
他叫比爾，綽號“肥鵝”(在英文中和“溜得快”諧音)
Goosefat Bill.

151
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:16,048
我聽說過這家伙，他身手敏捷
I know who he is. He got that moniker

152
00:21:16,055 --> 00:21:19,008
無論你把他關在哪，他總能想辦法溜出去，因而得此綽號
'cause he keeps slipping out from the bars you keep putting him behind.

153
00:21:19,015 --> 00:21:20,032
我們在你這抓到了他
He was found in this establishment,

154
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:21,085
這可於你不利啊
and that doesn't look good for you.

155
00:21:21,092 --> 00:21:22,072
到底是怎麼回事？
What's going on?

156
00:21:22,092 --> 00:21:23,072
什麼到底是怎麼回事？
What's going on where?

157
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:27,032
亞瑟，我那邊有些人對你很有興趣，經常提到你
You've got some heat on you, Arthur. Your name keeps coming up.

158
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,053
誰經常提起我？
In what circles?

159
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:30,029
我說是市井大媽們，你信?？
My mum's sewing circle.

160
00:21:30,036 --> 00:21:34,097
我可是個黑甲軍軍士長，蠢貨，你覺得我跟什麼人打交道最多？
I'm a Blackleg sergeant, stupid. What circles do you think?

161
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:37,053
現在告訴我那個叫露西的女孩
Now, tell me a story about a girl called Lucy,

162
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,004
那個維京人“灰鬍子”
a Viking called Greybeard,

163
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,061
還有那個牆上的叛軍塗鴉，是怎麼一回事？
and some rebel graffiti dirtying these walls.

164
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:42,077
你是不是打算寫一部書？
Are you writing a book?

165
00:21:42,084 --> 00:21:44,081
把每個細節都滴水不漏的告訴我
Tell me. Every detail.

166
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:49,008
我們跟那些維京人好好談了談
We had a quiet word with a couple of Vikings.

167
00:21:50,031 --> 00:21:52,042
退後，別亂動！
Get back! Back!

168
00:21:52,048 --> 00:21:55,022
我說了，從頭開始講
I said from the beginning, the very beginning.

169
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:56,029
我早上起床
I woke up.

170
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,056
然後呢？
Then?

171
00:21:58,062 --> 00:22:00,032
然後我穿好衣服
Well, then I got dressed...

172
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:02,029
我走下樓，看到那些女孩都在，但露西不見了
I went downstairs, I saw the girls. Lucy was missing.

173
00:22:02,036 --> 00:22:03,026
- 露西在哪？
- Where's Lucy?

174
00:22:03,033 --> 00:22:04,005
她是個好女孩
She's a good girl.

175
00:22:04,033 --> 00:22:05,003
不錯的女孩
A nice girl.

176
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,050
然後呢
Then?

177
00:22:08,046 --> 00:22:10,030
然後我跟這裡這位管賬的
Then, me and the lads took care of a bit of business.

178
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,043
談了會生意
Bit of housekeeping.

179
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,064
賬都對了?？
Everything as it should be?

180
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,024
這些是從那些船上搞來的
That's the spoil from the boats.

181
00:22:14,031 --> 00:22:15,006
然後呢
Then?

182
00:22:15,087 --> 00:22:17,027
昨晚喬治又惹事了
George had trouble again last night.

183
00:22:17,034 --> 00:22:18,081
好吧，去找他，我們前門見
All right, meet me out the front.

184
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:20,058
哪個喬治？暴脾氣的喬治？
Which George? King George? Angry George?

185
00:22:20,064 --> 00:22:22,085
有龍紋身的喬治？亞瑟，說清楚點，到底是哪個喬治？
George of the Dragon? Be clear, Arthur. Which George?

186
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,098
這附近也就一個叫喬治的
Our George.

187
00:22:24,005 --> 00:22:26,025
就是那個教功夫的喬治
Chinese George, Kung-Fu George.

188
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,089
我們聽說他惹上了
We heard he'd had some trouble with the...

189
00:22:28,095 --> 00:22:30,019
維京人
Vikings.

190
00:22:30,025 --> 00:22:32,026
那就是幫沒教養的家伙
Well, none of them are house-trained.

191
00:22:32,032 --> 00:22:33,006
我記得叫你口頭警告過他們了吧
I thought you'd warned them.

192
00:22:33,006 --> 00:22:35,006
是啊，但他們英語說得不太好
I did. They don't speak English good.

193
00:22:35,013 --> 00:22:36,039
只怕他們的英語說得比你溜
They speak it better than you.

194
00:22:36,046 --> 00:22:38,030
等等，再往前
Hold up, hold up. Back up.

195
00:22:38,036 --> 00:22:40,087
在去見喬治的路上，你沒遇到別人?？
Are you sure you didn't see someone else before you saw George?

196
00:22:41,087 --> 00:22:42,093
- 早上好，亞瑟
- Morning, Art.

197
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,080
我們遇到了麥克
We saw Mike.

198
00:22:44,087 --> 00:22:46,014
- 早上好，麥克
- All right, Mike.

199
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,054
哪個麥克？打鐵的麥克？還是屠夫麥克？
Mike the Spike? Kosher Mike? Which Mike?

200
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:48,087
你老問這些無意義的問題，都快把我搞暈了
You're giving me a headache.

201
00:22:48,094 --> 00:22:50,098
就是那個扁鼻子麥克
Flat-Nose Mike.

202
00:22:51,004 --> 00:22:52,081
他一直在我們的地盤走私毛皮，一直沒交保護費
He was trafficking furs through our vicinity without paying a commission.

203
00:22:52,088 --> 00:22:55,035
你今天運的貨比平常要多啊
That's quite a load, bit bigger than usual.

204
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,041
是啊，老闆臨時改變了計劃，於是就只好多運點了
Yeah, changed last minute. Just landed on me.

205
00:22:57,048 --> 00:22:58,088
- 多運點總比少運點要好
- More is better than less.

206
00:22:58,088 --> 00:23:00,088
- 是啊，麥克，多運點總比少運點要好
- More is always better than less, Mike.

207
00:23:00,095 --> 00:23:03,089
- 既然多運了點貨，是不是也給我們多來一點保護費啊，麥克
- More's definitely better than less, Mike. You've had a result.

208
00:23:03,095 --> 00:23:07,022
抱歉，亞瑟，我會補交的
I'm sorry, Art. It won't happen again. I promise.

209
00:23:07,096 --> 00:23:09,026
沒事，麥克
You're all right, Mike.

210
00:23:09,033 --> 00:23:11,006
既然能當朋友，又何必樹敵呢
Why have enemies when you can have friends?

211
00:23:11,013 --> 00:23:12,016
你把收到的錢藏哪了？
Where'd you put the money?

212
00:23:12,073 --> 00:23:13,070
什麼錢？
Money?

213
00:23:13,073 --> 00:23:14,000
什麼錢？
What money?

214
00:23:14,006 --> 00:23:16,013
你沒有把收來的錢存在你的箱子里??
Did you hide it with the rest of your coffers?

215
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,007
你到底想說什麼
You're all over the place.

216
00:23:17,007 --> 00:23:18,047
總是問這些無關緊要的問題
You can't keep your questions in a straight line.

217
00:23:18,054 --> 00:23:21,011
我正在回憶今天發生的事，而你老是打岔
I'm trying to tell a story here, and you keep interrupting.

218
00:23:21,017 --> 00:23:22,097
而且，你所說的箱子也不存在
Anyway, I don't have any coffers.

219
00:23:23,004 --> 00:23:24,071
你拿走了你的那份回扣
Once you've taken your share

220
00:23:24,078 --> 00:23:26,094
我這裡還有些人需要照顧，總之，最後一個子都不剩了
and I've looked after the weak
and needy, I'm left broke.

221
00:23:27,001 --> 00:23:28,038
繼續講麥克和毛皮貨的事
Mike and the furs.

222
00:23:28,044 --> 00:23:30,001
終於可以回歸正題了
So we're back to that story, are we now, Jack?

223
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:31,008
麥克，你這是乾啥呢
What are you doing, Mike?

224
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:32,012
您不是讓我交保護費?
Sharing the wealth.

225
00:23:32,018 --> 00:23:35,018
錢別給我，規矩不是這樣的，給威特，他負責管賬
Don't pass it to me, Mike. It doesn't work like that. Give it to Wet Stick.

226
00:23:35,025 --> 00:23:37,025
我是拜克·萊克，把錢給我乾啥
I'm Back Lack. What are you giving it to me for?

227
00:23:37,032 --> 00:23:38,022
那到底要我怎麼樣
What was I thinking?

228
00:23:38,032 --> 00:23:40,052
你不懂規矩？錢別給我們老闆，他不管賬的
Don't upset the boss, Mike. He doesn't handle the money.

229
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:41,092
抱歉，今天忙的我暈頭轉向
Sorry, it's been a long day.

230
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:43,066
這才大清早呢，你就忙暈了？每天按時交錢，就不會有這麼多事了
It's first thing in the morning, Mike.

231
00:23:43,073 --> 00:23:44,053
最後你們收到了錢?？
Did he pay?

232
00:23:44,073 --> 00:23:46,053
當然，那個麥克可是個老實人
'Course he paid. He's a good boy, that Mike.

233
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,093
拿好零錢，找個人好好教教你道上的規矩
Buy some lessons in street etiquette with the change.

234
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,087
- 那零錢呢？ - 麥克，我們不找零
- Change? - There's no change, Mike.

235
00:23:50,093 --> 00:23:51,087
回見，麥克
See you later, Mike.

236
00:23:51,087 --> 00:23:52,080
再見，麥克
Cheers, Mike!

237
00:23:52,087 --> 00:23:53,097
天，這幫人真難纏
God.

238
00:23:54,004 --> 00:23:55,057
傑克，你還想問什麼？
What is this about, Jack?

239
00:23:55,064 --> 00:23:58,034
還有那個小男孩畫的反動塗鴉
Rebel graffiti. A young boy.

240
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:00,008
沒搞錯的話，應該就是你的兒子布魯畫的吧
Your boy. Blue Boy.

241
00:24:00,014 --> 00:24:01,061
別搞錯了，他可是個好孩子
And he's a good boy.

242
00:24:01,068 --> 00:24:03,021
你們這些小屁孩在乾啥呢
Oi! What are you lot doing?

243
00:24:03,028 --> 00:24:05,065
傑克，不要妄加揣測
Don't start getting the wrong end of the stick, Jack.

244
00:24:05,072 --> 00:24:07,018
他跟那些叛亂分子毫無瓜葛
He's an upstanding citizen.

245
00:24:07,025 --> 00:24:08,088
萊克，你最好管管你家的小東西
I think I found something that belongs to you, Lack.

246
00:24:08,095 --> 00:24:10,045
小混蛋，你在乾啥呢？
What you doing, boy?

247
00:24:10,052 --> 00:24:11,059
他馬上就要回來了
He's coming back.

248
00:24:11,065 --> 00:24:12,089
你說誰要回來了？
Who's coming back?

249
00:24:12,096 --> 00:24:14,032
那個“合法繼承人”
The born king.

250
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:16,033
是啊是啊，等他回來了，肯定會打你的屁股
Yeah, and when he does, he'll spank your arse.

251
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:18,064
趕緊把手洗乾凈，要是被黑甲軍看見你在畫塗鴉
Now, let's get your hands clean while you still got some.

252
00:24:18,066 --> 00:24:20,043
他們會把你抓走，把你的手給剁嘍
He'll cut 'em off and have you in chains.

253
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:22,043
這次只是被我們撞見了，下次可就說不准了
If we can catch you, they can catch you.

254
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,023
最好別讓我手下的人抓到他在畫塗鴉
If you can catch him, so can we.

255
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,070
我們繼續講喬治的事，他跟維京人
Should we go back to George, and the trouble with the...

256
00:24:25,077 --> 00:24:26,047
有點過節
Vikings.

257
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,017
發生什麼事了？
So what happened?

258
00:24:27,024 --> 00:24:28,094
這些人欺人太甚
Started throwing their weight about

259
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:31,024
- 他們把露西打了一頓 - 你說什麼？
- and then Lucy got the worst of it. - Come again, George?

260
00:24:31,031 --> 00:24:32,008
他們打傷了露西
They hurt Lucy.

261
00:24:32,091 --> 00:24:33,098
傑克，欺負我的人，這可不行
That can't happen, Jack.

262
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:35,025
傑克，這絕對不行
That can never happen, Jack.

263
00:24:35,031 --> 00:24:36,055
她是我的朋友
You see, she's a friend of mine.

264
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,018
所以你們既然傷了她，那就給她錢作為補償
So you're gonna have to sort her out.

265
00:24:38,025 --> 00:24:40,028
我們已經警告過他們不要動手傷人了，那他們這次就要付出代價了
They'd been warned. They had to pay.

266
00:24:40,035 --> 00:24:42,065
你怎麼從維京人手上搞到錢的？
How'd you get money from a Viking?

267
00:24:42,072 --> 00:24:44,052
怎麼老有人問這麼搞笑的問題
I feel a joke coming on here.

268
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:45,082
直接問他們要就行了啊
You ask him for it.

269
00:24:45,089 --> 00:24:47,059
不賠錢，你們今天就別想走了
You're paying and then you're leaving.

270
00:24:48,093 --> 00:24:50,066
閉嘴，我沒跟你講話
Nobody's talking to you, sweetheart.

271
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:52,063
你最好坐在那，把嘴閉上
You sit there and be quiet. You are better at that...

272
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:55,006
然而他不聽勸，我們就給他大腿上來了一箭
Or I'll have to put an arrow through your lard-loving thigh.

273
00:24:56,053 --> 00:24:59,017
你不是沒帶武器?，你怎麼可能就這麼大搖大擺的走到他們面前，問他們要錢？
You were unarmed. You just walked in there and asked them for it?

274
00:24:59,024 --> 00:25:00,097
沒錯，傑克，我就這麼大搖大擺的走到了他們的面前，拿到了錢
That's right, Jack, and they gave it to me.

275
00:25:01,004 --> 00:25:03,027
他們披著今天早上扁鼻子麥克運的皮草
They were trying on furs. The same furs, as it happens

276
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:05,021
正是麥克想瞞著我們偷運的那批貨
that Flat-Nose Mike tried to hide from us.

277
00:25:05,028 --> 00:25:07,031
多運點總比少運點要好，麥克
More is always better than less, Mike.

278
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:08,098
然後維京人“灰鬍子”開始吹牛了
Old Greybeard banged on for a bit.

279
00:25:09,005 --> 00:25:11,022
我這有五十個身經百戰的戰士
I got 50 seasoned men of war.

280
00:25:11,028 --> 00:25:13,098
他們刀法了得，想要見識一下?
You could shave a pig on the edge of our blades.

281
00:25:14,005 --> 00:25:16,065
你說你沒帶武器，那你頂著他喉嚨的那把刀是哪來的？
If you were unarmed, where'd you find the blade to put to his throat?

282
00:25:16,072 --> 00:25:18,076
拜克·萊克一箭射中了那家伙的大腿，他痛苦的嚎叫起來
Well, I borrowed it from his big, silly mate

283
00:25:18,082 --> 00:25:21,046
然後我就把他的刀一把奪過來
after Back Lack put an arrow
through his lard-loving thigh.

284
00:25:25,076 --> 00:25:27,006
退後，別亂動
Get back!

285
00:25:27,013 --> 00:25:28,070
所有細節都告訴你了，傑克
That's your story, Jack.

286
00:25:28,077 --> 00:25:29,097
這事這麼著
I am leaving.

287
00:25:30,003 --> 00:25:31,097
你賠她一年的工錢，這事就算扯平了
But I'm leaving with a year's wages.

288
00:25:32,004 --> 00:25:35,011
“灰鬍子”同意賠錢
Old Greybeard surrendered his dignity.

289
00:25:35,017 --> 00:25:37,037
露西拿到了一年的工錢
Lucy got a year's worth of wages.

290
00:25:37,044 --> 00:25:39,058
再也沒人畫所謂的反動塗鴉了
And the rebel graffiti exists no more

291
00:25:39,064 --> 00:25:43,038
因為布魯和他的爸爸都是遵紀守法的人
because of the law-abiding, proactive Blue Boy and his fun-loving dad.

292
00:25:43,045 --> 00:25:46,082
最後，我們大家又可以過上幸福的生活了
And then, they all lived happily ever after.

293
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:49,079
亞瑟，事情沒有你想的那麼簡單
No, they didn't, Arthur.

294
00:25:49,085 --> 00:25:52,099
我一直以為你是個萬事通
Because for the first time, there's something you don't know.

295
00:25:53,006 --> 00:25:54,099
沒想到，還有你不知道的事
Something nobody told you.

296
00:25:55,006 --> 00:25:57,009
什麼事？
And that is?

297
00:25:57,016 --> 00:25:59,046
那幫維京人，可是受國王保護的
They're under the protection of the king.

298
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,054
你要是招惹了他們，恐怕沒好果子吃，到時候我可幫不了你
And once you're under the protection of the king, I can't help you.

299
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,067
誰都救不了你
Nobody can.

300
00:26:09,061 --> 00:26:11,054
我覺得，他們大概也不會在意我這個無名小卒吧
They're not gonna bother about me.

301
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:16,065
麥西亞，現在情況如何？
Where do we stand, Mercia?

302
00:26:16,071 --> 00:26:19,001
目前和他年齡相仿的人我們基本都找來了
We're down to the last men of the right age.

303
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:22,005
還是沒有人能把那柄劍拔出來
And still no one has pulled the sword.

304
00:26:22,012 --> 00:26:25,016
卡蒂亞，把鳥放回籠子里
Now put the bird back in the aviary, Catia.

305
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:34,000
不安的氣氛在民眾間蔓延
There's a general restlessness among the people.

306
00:26:34,006 --> 00:26:37,003
事故頻發，到處都有反動塗鴉
More incidents. More graffiti.

307
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:41,017
陛下，請您原諒
I beg your pardon, Your Majesty.

308
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,017
如果我早知道您光臨寒舍...
If I'd known...

309
00:26:42,024 --> 00:26:43,027
來，坐下
Come here.

310
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,057
我要問你點事
I want your opinion.

311
00:26:45,081 --> 00:26:47,058
都說麥琪可以代表民眾的意見
Maggie represents the people.

312
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:50,048
她出生於英格蘭歷史最悠久的家族
She's from one of the oldest families in England.

313
00:26:50,055 --> 00:26:51,078
她能夠解答我的疑惑
She can tell us.

314
00:26:51,085 --> 00:26:53,005
大人，您想問什麼？
Sire.

315
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,032
民眾們愛戴他們的國君?？
Do the people love me?

316
00:26:58,012 --> 00:26:59,079
陛下，我十分愛戴您
I love Your Majesty

317
00:26:59,086 --> 00:27:04,093
如果我可以代表民眾的話，那民眾都是愛戴您的
and if I represent the people, then you have your answer.

318
00:27:04,099 --> 00:27:06,053
給我們做點吃的吧
Bring us something to eat.

319
00:27:12,054 --> 00:27:14,004
其實我在想
Even I am left to wonder

320
00:27:14,011 --> 00:27:16,034
我們是不是有點做的過頭了
if we are pushing them too far...

321
00:27:19,088 --> 00:27:21,048
儘快把塔樓修好
Finish the tower.

322
00:27:22,055 --> 00:27:24,075
其它的都只是毫無意義的揣測
Everything else will be academic.

323
00:27:29,089 --> 00:27:31,019
謝謝你，麥琪
Thank you, Maggie.

324
00:27:49,064 --> 00:27:50,081
醒醒！
Wake up!

325
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:52,044
你必須掌控它
You must control it.

326
00:27:54,078 --> 00:27:56,038
醒醒，聽我說
Wake up! Listen!

327
00:27:56,045 --> 00:27:58,071
你必須離開這，馬上就走！
You need to get out of here, now!

328
00:27:58,078 --> 00:27:59,092
萊克，怎麼了？
What are you doing, Lack?

329
00:27:59,098 --> 00:28:01,015
傑克說的不假
Jack's Eye was telling the truth.

330
00:28:01,022 --> 00:28:02,059
那幫維京人是不好惹的
Those red beards are connected.

331
00:28:02,065 --> 00:28:03,095
所以呢？我們也不好惹啊
So, what? So are we.

332
00:28:04,002 --> 00:28:05,039
不不不，你不明白
No, you don't understand.

333
00:28:05,045 --> 00:28:07,026
黑甲軍馬上就要到了
The Blacklegs are coming.

334
00:28:07,032 --> 00:28:10,023
他們估計是想拿你殺雞儆猴
And when they get here, they're gonna make an example out of you.

335
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:11,080
你必須馬上動身了
You gotta go now.

336
00:28:11,086 --> 00:28:13,094
door. Get out the window。
別走前門，從窗戶那邊出去
And you can't use the front

337
00:28:14,093 --> 00:28:16,000
他們來了，快走！
They're here, move!

338
00:28:16,007 --> 00:28:17,083
快開門！
Open the door!

339
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:20,014
後面的兩個人！
Oi, you two, in the back!

340
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,054
把門撞開
Kick the door down!

341
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,038
你準備好了?
Are you ready?

342
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,098
當然
Yeah, of course.

343
00:28:32,095 --> 00:28:33,092
早啊，各位
All right, fellas?

344
00:28:33,095 --> 00:28:36,052
早啊，小子，這麼大清早的就跑出來乾啥呢？
Hello, boy. What are you doing out at this time?

345
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:39,022
大人，我是個船工，要趁早潮出海呢
I work on the boats, sir. Out on the first tide.

346
00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:42,043
是?，你包里裝的是什麼
The boats, eh? What's in the bag?

347
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:44,016
我們在找一個人，看起來你跟他年齡相仿啊
And you're about the right age.

348
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:46,013
給我們看看你的標記
Show us your brand.

349
00:28:50,033 --> 00:28:51,074
你還沒去測試過啊
Have you not been tested?

350
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,037
我一直在海上，大人，一直沒機會去測試
I'm always at sea, sir. Haven't had the chance.

351
00:28:54,044 --> 00:28:56,031
那恐怕你得跟我們走一趟了
Well, that's about to change now.

352
00:28:56,037 --> 00:29:00,018
放心，我們會讓你上船的，只不過不是上你的船
You're going on a boat, all right. Just not the one you think.

353
00:29:09,012 --> 00:29:10,005
到了，下船！
Come on, get off!

354
00:29:10,012 --> 00:29:11,025
排成一列
Single file!

355
00:29:11,032 --> 00:29:13,012
快點，趕快下船
Come on, get 'em off.

356
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:16,093
做完測試給他們做標記，給他們喝的，讓他們上船，送他們回去！
Get your brand, get your drink, then back on the barge!

357
00:29:16,099 --> 00:29:18,029
往前走！
Move!

358
00:29:18,036 --> 00:29:21,047
走快點，往前走！
Move it! Come on! Move!

359
00:29:21,053 --> 00:29:22,077
往前走！
Keep coming!

360
00:29:24,073 --> 00:29:26,004
往前走！
Move it!

361
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,097
我們這是來乾啥呢
What's all that about?

362
00:29:28,004 --> 00:29:30,031
估計是因為我們沒賄賂那些當兵的，所以就被送過來了
Guess that's what you get when you don't pay up.

363
00:29:30,037 --> 00:29:31,081
現在連小孩子都抓了？
Taking the kids now.

364
00:29:31,088 --> 00:29:34,044
把這些孩子關在這是什麼意思
What's he got them all penned up out here for?

365
00:29:34,051 --> 00:29:37,075
哥們，你問題這麼多，等你見到了國王本人，你可以去問他啊
Well, when you see the king, why don't you ask him?

366
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:38,082
走快點！
Hurry up!

367
00:29:40,065 --> 00:29:41,065
往前走！
Move along!

368
00:29:52,043 --> 00:29:53,083
那邊是在搞什麼名堂？
What was that?

369
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:55,043
天佑吾王！
God save the king.

370
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:05,008
媽的，這麼多人，抱歉，讓一讓
Bollocks. Excuse me, mate.

371
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:07,021
別動他
Leave it.

372
00:30:08,005 --> 00:30:10,038
抱歉，讓我先過去，伙計
Excuse me. Behind you, pal.

373
00:30:10,045 --> 00:30:12,038
讓一讓
Here, mind your back.

374
00:30:12,045 --> 00:30:14,032
兄弟，你怎麼不排隊？
Oi, pal, there's a line here.

375
00:30:15,072 --> 00:30:16,089
閉嘴吧你
John.

376
00:30:19,092 --> 00:30:20,092
好吧，當我沒說
All right, pal.

377
00:30:23,053 --> 00:30:25,020
終於輪到我了，兄弟
As you were, mate.

378
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,080
好了，現在要我幹嘛
All right, where do you want me?

379
00:30:28,087 --> 00:30:31,040
特雷格，又來了一個
Trigger, I think we got one here.

380
00:30:33,047 --> 00:30:35,000
這還用問?
Bouncing on my knee.

381
00:30:35,007 --> 00:30:37,067
用手抓住劍柄，把劍拔出來，蠢貨
Where do you think I want you? Hands on the hilt, stupid.

382
00:31:03,033 --> 00:31:05,054
嘿，用兩隻手
Oi, both hands.

383
00:31:07,004 --> 00:31:08,094
聽不懂人話?？
I said, both hands.

384
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:14,048
用兩隻手，十根手指
Right, ten digits

385
00:31:14,054 --> 00:31:16,085
握住劍柄，用力拔
round the blunt bit. Give it a tug.

386
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:18,098
抬腿走到那邊
Left foot, right foot.

387
00:31:19,005 --> 00:31:20,025
給你打上標記
Collect your brand.

388
00:31:20,032 --> 00:31:21,079
送你上船回家，完事
Back on the barge.

389
00:32:28,082 --> 00:32:30,026
關於他你就查到這些？
That's everything you know about him?

390
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:33,029
他的朋友們都跑路了
His people were quick to disappear.

391
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:35,083
能查到的只有這些
We got what information we could.

392
00:32:35,089 --> 00:32:39,026
看起來他交際圈挺廣啊
Got a lot of fingers in a lot of pies.

393
00:32:39,033 --> 00:32:41,040
連軍隊中的人都認識
Blacklegs in his pockets, too.

394
00:32:44,043 --> 00:32:46,000
這事我親自處理
I'll deal with this.

395
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:47,047
國王
My king.

396
00:32:54,081 --> 00:32:55,091
此事要慎重處理
Carefully.

397
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:22,071
所以你就是烏瑟的兒子
So you're Uther's son.

398
00:33:22,077 --> 00:33:26,038
你不但成功幸存下來
Not only did you survive in the gutter,

399
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:31,025
還在惡劣的環境中茁壯成長起來了
you blossomed out of manure.

400
00:33:31,031 --> 00:33:33,095
大人，我想您是找錯人了
You've got the wrong man, sire.

401
00:33:34,002 --> 00:33:38,065
我出生在倫底紐姆一座橋旁的妓院里
I was born in a brothel, on a bridge in Londinium.

402
00:33:38,072 --> 00:33:42,043
只有烏瑟·潘德拉貢或者他的後嗣
The sword can only be drawn by Uther Pendragon

403
00:33:43,026 --> 00:33:46,019
能拔出那把聖劍
or his direct heir.

404
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:49,007
你肯定感覺到了那股力量
You felt it, didn't you?

405
00:33:49,013 --> 00:33:50,047
不是?
The power.

406
00:33:50,053 --> 00:33:52,047
正是因為那股力量你才能操控聖劍
That's what put you out.

407
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,047
你只是不知道怎麼控制那股力量罷了
You just don't know how to control it.

408
00:33:55,054 --> 00:33:58,074
我只是一個妓女的私生子罷了
I'm nothing but the bastard son of a prostitute.

409
00:33:58,081 --> 00:34:02,071
你我之間的共同點比你想象中的要多
You and I have a lot more in common than you think.

410
00:34:02,078 --> 00:34:04,071
我們不僅有同樣的血統
It's not just the same blood we share,

411
00:34:04,078 --> 00:34:07,095
還有著相同的志趣
but also the same interests.

412
00:34:08,002 --> 00:34:11,015
我們都渴望擁有力量
We both developed a palate for power.

413
00:34:11,022 --> 00:34:13,086
我從未擁有過任何力量
I've never had any power.

414
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:16,016
也從未渴望獲得它
Or any desire to achieve it.

415
00:34:18,009 --> 00:34:19,036
大人
Sire.

416
00:34:19,043 --> 00:34:22,050
我可以一走了之
I could simply drift away,

417
00:34:22,057 --> 00:34:23,087
永遠不再拋頭露面
never to be seen again.

418
00:34:23,093 --> 00:34:25,064
儘管我很願意相信你所說的話
As much as I'd like to believe you,

419
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:28,011
但因你性格使然，你定會不甘平庸
your character makes that unlikely.

420
00:34:29,031 --> 00:34:30,077
當在牢里呼呼大睡的時候
While you were asleep,

421
00:34:31,057 --> 00:34:33,088
我們也沒閑著，搜查了你的住處
we've been busy.

422
00:34:33,094 --> 00:34:35,061
通過調查，我知道了你是個怎樣的人
I know what kind of a man you are.

423
00:34:35,068 --> 00:34:37,065
我調查了你的背景，看到了你的成就
I know your story.

424
00:34:37,071 --> 00:34:40,092
還發現了你的箱子
And, I've seen your coffers.

425
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,079
你的野心
Your achievements.

426
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,072
就是我必須
Now stand,

427
00:34:49,056 --> 00:34:51,080
殺掉你的理由
as your prosecution.

428
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:57,087
要是你當年繼承了你父親的王位
What kind of a man would you have become

429
00:34:57,093 --> 00:35:00,060
享盡榮華富貴
had you inherited your father's kingdom

430
00:35:00,067 --> 00:35:03,021
而不是在一個妓院里長大
and all its advantages,

431
00:35:03,027 --> 00:35:05,094
你會變成一個怎樣的人呢？
instead of being raised in a brothel?

432
00:35:09,061 --> 00:35:12,018
是什麼撐起了你的野心？
What gave you such drive?

433
00:35:25,043 --> 00:35:27,063
所以你想把我怎麼樣？
So, what happens now?

434
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:29,077
你知道的
You know what happens now.

435
00:35:31,017 --> 00:35:33,057
你很快就會成為一個傳奇
You're quickly becoming a legend.

436
00:35:41,034 --> 00:35:43,055
有人來找你了
Someone here to see you.

437
00:35:43,061 --> 00:35:44,082
誰？
Mmm-hmm.

438
00:35:45,065 --> 00:35:46,095
我覺得你需要見見她
I think you need to see her.

439
00:36:12,078 --> 00:36:15,055
你應該知道我是誰吧？
Do you know who I am?

440
00:36:16,051 --> 00:36:18,062
法師，我認識你
I know who you are, Mage.

441
00:36:18,068 --> 00:36:21,025
我在夢裡見到過你
I've seen you in my dreams.

442
00:36:23,092 --> 00:36:25,059
是梅林派你來的
You've been sent by Merlin.

443
00:36:25,066 --> 00:36:28,036
那你應該知道我是為何而來了
Then you know why I am here.

444
00:36:28,042 --> 00:36:30,076
這麼說來，你就是他的導師了
So, you will be his guide.

445
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:32,063
你要幫我把他救出來
And you will help me.

446
00:36:53,082 --> 00:36:55,005
把他帶過來
Bring him here.

447
00:36:58,086 --> 00:37:01,026
外面有成千上萬的民眾
There's a crowd of thousands out there.

448
00:37:03,036 --> 00:37:06,020
他們都是來看你的
They've come to see you more than they've come to see me.

449
00:37:22,085 --> 00:37:24,091
我會向他們展示我的權力
I will show them power.

450
00:37:26,002 --> 00:37:29,022
我會向他們展示我的力量
I will show them strength,

451
00:37:29,028 --> 00:37:30,075
展示我的高貴
and dignity.

452
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:35,053
而你，向他們展示謊言、軟弱
You will show them lies, weakness,

453
00:37:35,059 --> 00:37:37,029
和恥辱
and shame.

454
00:37:37,036 --> 00:37:39,030
伏提庚王萬歲！
Hail, King Vortigern!

455
00:37:39,036 --> 00:37:42,003
伏提庚王萬歲！
King Vortigern!

456
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,090
他們可能是來看你的
They may have come for you...

457
00:37:43,097 --> 00:37:45,047
但是他們離開時
but they will leave,

458
00:37:45,053 --> 00:37:48,017
會把我的形象深深刻在腦海裡
and will leave with a lasting impression of me.

459
00:37:49,064 --> 00:37:51,091
他們可能會憎惡我
They may even hate me.

460
00:37:51,097 --> 00:37:54,058
讓他們恨去吧
I'll let them hate,

461
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:56,085
我只需要他們畏懼我
just so long as they fear.

462
00:37:56,091 --> 00:37:58,082
人們打心底裡
When people fear you...

463
00:37:58,088 --> 00:38:01,015
畏懼我
I mean, really fear you...

464
00:38:01,022 --> 00:38:04,079
對我來說
It is the most

465
00:38:04,085 --> 00:38:07,019
這種感覺是世界上
intoxicating sensation

466
00:38:07,026 --> 00:38:08,099
最令人心醉神迷的事情了
a man can possess.

467
00:38:10,016 --> 00:38:13,083
這股難以言說的力量
A force of something almost indescribable

468
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,000
在我的血液里流淌
moves through your blood

469
00:38:15,006 --> 00:38:16,070
我深陷於其中，無法自拔
and takes you over completely.

470
00:38:18,017 --> 00:38:19,087
伏提庚王萬歲！
King Vortigern!

471
00:38:19,094 --> 00:38:23,047
伏提庚王萬歲！
King Vortigern! King Vortigern!

472
00:38:23,057 --> 00:38:27,001
伏提庚王萬歲！
King Vortigern! King Vortigern!

473
00:38:27,008 --> 00:38:32,012
伏提庚王萬歲！
King Vortigern! King Vortigern!

474
00:38:35,032 --> 00:38:39,062
我明白，你捍衛這位妓女尊嚴的行為
I understand that your actions were very noble,

475
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:41,046
是十分高尚的
of defending this whore's honor.

476
00:38:42,029 --> 00:38:44,006
但很不幸的是
How unfortunate

477
00:38:44,013 --> 00:38:46,086
你為此得罪了我尊貴的維京客人
it was at the expense of my Viking guests.

478
00:38:46,093 --> 00:38:48,076
伏提庚王萬歲！
King Vortigern!

479
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:51,063
伏提庚王萬歲！
King Vortigern! King Vortigern!

480
00:39:04,085 --> 00:39:07,078
看，這就是你們所謂的“合法繼承人”
Behold, your born king.

481
00:39:10,065 --> 00:39:14,019
他把聖劍從石頭裡拔了出來
Behold the man who pulled sword from stone.

482
00:39:15,072 --> 00:39:17,019
有人曾預言說你會回來繼承王位
You wanted a prophecy.

483
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:21,097
那我們現在來看看這個預言是否準確
This is your prophecy.

484
00:39:22,073 --> 00:39:24,020
陛下，您現在
Now tell us, king,

485
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,090
有什麼想說的?
what do you have to say?

486
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:28,074
等你人頭落地
When your head rolls to me,

487
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:32,007
你會化作一個傳奇
the legend you've fast become will just as quickly...

488
00:39:32,014 --> 00:39:33,064
您有什麼想對您的臣民說的?？
Here are your people.

489
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:36,021
我的威望也必將隨之迅速提高
add to the reverence of my name.

490
00:39:37,048 --> 00:39:38,082
對此
And for this,

491
00:39:40,025 --> 00:39:41,082
我向你深表敬意
I salute you.

492
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:50,049
不！
No!

493
00:39:51,086 --> 00:39:52,071
如果你真的是合法繼承人
If you're the king...

494
00:39:52,071 --> 00:39:53,056
不！
No!

495
00:39:53,063 --> 00:39:54,083
那你就大聲說出來
declare yourself.

496
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:59,017
如果你不按我所說的做
The rest of them will follow,

497
00:39:59,024 --> 00:40:01,084
我會把她們一個一個殺死在你的面前
unless you do what needs to be done.

498
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:03,027
你聽懂了?？
Do we understand each other?

499
00:40:07,088 --> 00:40:10,008
如果你不知道該說什麼
If you are lost for words,

500
00:40:10,015 --> 00:40:12,035
那就讓聖劍為你發聲
then let the sword speak for you.

501
00:40:13,075 --> 00:40:15,095
拿起來
Take it!

502
00:40:16,002 --> 00:40:18,099
向臺下的人們展示聖劍的力量
And show the people the power of Excalibur.

503
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,086
你不是合法繼承人?，拿著啊
I said, take it, king.

504
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:30,013
拿起劍啊
Raise that sword!

505
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:37,001
看來你不行
I thought not.

506
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:38,084
我們不能讓這個騙子
This man,

507
00:40:38,091 --> 00:40:41,071
給我們的繁榮昌盛的國家
cannot be allowed to bring discord

508
00:40:41,078 --> 00:40:43,045
帶來混亂
to our flourishing nation.

509
00:40:44,081 --> 00:40:46,032
他不是合法繼承人！
You're not the king!

510
00:40:48,068 --> 00:40:50,055
砍了他的頭！
Off with his head!

511
00:40:56,009 --> 00:40:57,043
他不是合法繼承人！
You're no king!

512
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,020
保護陛下！
Protect the king!

513
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,020
保護陛下！
Protect the king!

514
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,040
我們走
Come.

515
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:03,069
快走！
Come on!

516
00:42:03,076 --> 00:42:04,096
快走！
Move! Move!

517
00:42:05,003 --> 00:42:06,093
把劍追回來！把他抓回來！
Get the sword! Get after him!

518
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,067
快追！
The sword!

519
00:42:15,004 --> 00:42:16,047
快跑！
Move!

520
00:42:22,021 --> 00:42:24,038
快跑！
Come on. Move!

521
00:42:33,042 --> 00:42:34,052
快！
Come on!

522
00:42:35,056 --> 00:42:36,056
跳！
Now!

523
00:43:15,036 --> 00:43:18,057
有沒有人能告訴我，我們這是要去哪？
Someone gonna tell me where we're going?

524
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,040
沒有
No.

525
00:43:36,002 --> 00:43:38,005
那你盯著我看幹嘛
So what is it you're looking at, then?

526
00:43:39,056 --> 00:43:42,032
我覺得你挺不錯的，你是不是也看上我了？
Are you falling for me like I'm falling for you?

527
00:43:43,076 --> 00:43:45,016
我們最好小心點
We wanna be careful.

528
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,050
你這招不錯啊
That's a neat trick.

529
00:43:51,057 --> 00:43:54,004
以後有空的話你得教我這招
You'll have to teach me how to do that.

530
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:55,070
扶他上馬
Put him back on his horse.

531
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:17,049
你好啊，老鷹
Oh, hello.

532
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:22,066
感覺成為你們中的一員是件很危險的事啊
It's quite dangerous being one of you lot, isn't it?

533
00:44:22,073 --> 00:44:24,063
你應該很擅長和動物打交道吧？
You're good with animals, aren't you?

534
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:27,020
擁有這類能力的人有一個專門的名字
They have a word for that, don't they?

535
00:44:29,004 --> 00:44:30,097
是叫“法師”，對吧
"Mage".

536
00:44:31,004 --> 00:44:33,011
我還以為所有的法師都是壞人呢
I thought your team was outlawed.

537
00:44:33,018 --> 00:44:35,074
以前從未真正見過一位法師
Never met one of you in the flesh.

538
00:44:35,081 --> 00:44:37,075
你比我想象中的要矮
I thought you'd be taller.

539
00:44:39,008 --> 00:44:40,028
而且我還以為法師都蓄鬍子呢
And have a beard.

540
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:46,086
你們知道?，就算拿這個蒙著我的頭，我也能看到周圍的情況
You do know I can see through this?

541
00:44:46,092 --> 00:44:48,052
沒錯，周圍都是樹
Trees everywhere.

542
00:45:13,018 --> 00:45:14,028
把我的外套掛起來
Hang that up.

543
00:45:14,035 --> 00:45:16,015
別把它弄皺了
Don't want it getting creased.

544
00:45:35,034 --> 00:45:39,028
你就是那個告發"肥鵝“比爾的家伙吧
So, you're the chap that turned in Goosefat Bill.

545
00:45:41,034 --> 00:45:45,025
沒辦法，他選錯了藏身之地
Unlike you, he chose the wrong place to hide.

546
00:45:45,031 --> 00:45:49,085
你應該知道他在黑甲軍的通緝名單中排行第三吧？
You know he was the third most wanted man on the Blackleg's list?

547
00:45:49,092 --> 00:45:52,002
黑甲軍一直都想抓住他
They've been trying to catch him for some time.

548
00:45:52,009 --> 00:45:55,066
我再說一遍，他選錯了藏身之地
Like I said, your man chose the wrong place to hide.

549
00:45:55,072 --> 00:45:57,033
是?
So it seems.

550
00:45:58,056 --> 00:46:01,006
喲，我剛剛還在想你現在如何了
I was wondering what happened to you.

551
00:46:01,013 --> 00:46:03,000
看起來沒什麼大礙嘛，我跟你說的不假吧，他們是不是待你不薄
I told you, you were in safe hands.

552
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:06,003
聽說你在黑甲軍中是個大名人啊
You've made quite a celebrity of yourself among the Blackleg ranks.

553
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:09,004
而且，你跟近衛軍的關係混的可不是
You've done very nicely on the back of your cozy relationship

554
00:46:09,011 --> 00:46:10,081
一般的好啊
with your kingsmen.

555
00:46:10,087 --> 00:46:13,004
還輪不到你們指著鼻子來諷刺我
You know, I'm a little old for finger-wagging and speeches

556
00:46:13,011 --> 00:46:17,028
除非你是我親爹，那你隨便說；不過這應該不可能
So, unless you're my dad, which, I believe, is unlikely,

557
00:46:17,035 --> 00:46:20,048
所以，能不能直截了當的告訴我，你們到底想怎樣？
can you just get around to telling me
exactly what it is you want?

558
00:46:21,088 --> 00:46:23,052
那你說說看，你想幹嘛
What is it that you want?

559
00:46:23,059 --> 00:46:25,072
我想拍拍屁股走人
I want to get my arse out of here

560
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:28,076
回去找找我的朋友，看看能不能想辦法找個地方過安穩日子
and see what's left of my life and the people in it.

561
00:46:28,082 --> 00:46:30,093
你們肯定不會就這麼放我走的，對吧？
But you're not gonna let me do that, are you?

562
00:46:30,099 --> 00:46:32,036
為什麼我們一定不會放你走？
And why aren't we?

563
00:46:32,043 --> 00:46:33,083
為了救我，你的兩位手下犧牲了
You just lost two men.

564
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:39,047
你總共派出五個手下，冒著生命危險救回我的小命
But you were prepared to lose five to save this pretty neck.

565
00:46:39,054 --> 00:46:40,047
我認識你?？為什麼救我？
Do I know you?

566
00:46:40,054 --> 00:46:41,097
待會你就認識了
You will in a minute.

567
00:46:42,004 --> 00:46:43,034
把手綁上
Put your hands out.

568
00:46:43,041 --> 00:46:44,077
不，老兄
I don't think so, mate.

569
00:46:44,084 --> 00:46:46,078
所以你們肯定不會放我走
So I'm not going anywhere, am I?

570
00:46:46,084 --> 00:46:48,038
那你現在能去哪呢？
Where exactly were you thinking of going?

571
00:46:48,044 --> 00:46:50,075
你已經無家可歸了，幾天前國王就下令夷平你的房子了
You have no more home. It was razed days ago.

572
00:46:50,081 --> 00:46:52,061
你以前的生活已經不復存在了
You've no more life to go back to.

573
00:46:52,068 --> 00:46:55,035
不管你喜不喜歡，以後這就是你的家了
Like it or not, this is your lot.

574
00:46:56,092 --> 00:46:59,012
雖然我們都不喜歡你，但也沒辦法
And even we don't like you.

575
00:46:59,019 --> 00:47:00,039
是吧，“肥鵝”
Do we, Goosefat?

576
00:47:03,036 --> 00:47:05,089
我們感興趣的是
But what we are interested in,

577
00:47:07,023 --> 00:47:10,023
你怎麼操控這柄劍
is what you can do with this sword.

578
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:13,090
頭兒，給我幾分鐘，我跟他好好談談
Why don't you leave him with me for a minute or two, boss?

579
00:47:16,087 --> 00:47:18,084
把戒指戴上吧，親愛的
Put your ring back on, honey tits.

580
00:47:18,091 --> 00:47:21,039
聽你說話有氣無力的樣子，只怕你今天早上是沒吃飯哦
You haven't had enough porridge this morning to talk like that.

581
00:47:21,044 --> 00:47:24,075
大人，如果你真的喜歡那把劍
And if you like that sword so much, your lordship,

582
00:47:24,081 --> 00:47:26,028
那你就留著它吧
you can keep it,

583
00:47:26,035 --> 00:47:27,092
用來剝葡萄皮挺好使的
to peel your grapes.

584
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:31,022
如果我把戒指戴上的話
Now that would've hurt a lot more

585
00:47:31,029 --> 00:47:33,026
只怕你會覺得更疼
if I left the ring on.

586
00:47:37,099 --> 00:47:39,089
你們的小伎倆我再清楚不過了
I see what you're doing.

587
00:47:39,096 --> 00:47:42,007
你們想激怒我，這樣我就會拿起那把劍比劃幾下
You're trying to get me to do something

588
00:47:42,007 --> 00:47:43,007
然後你們就會勸我去做什麼反抗暴政的大事
razzle-dazzle with that sword.

589
00:47:43,013 --> 00:47:45,053
我現在跟你們說清楚了
I'm gonna tell you right now,

590
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:48,004
我不會摻和你們的破事
I'm not gettin' drawn into this mess.

591
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:49,087
你看你們這有這麼多人
And there's an army of you,

592
00:47:49,094 --> 00:47:51,057
乾大事不差我這一個
there's only one of me.

593
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:55,028
我很多年沒打架了，身手不行了
I haven't had a fight for years.

594
00:47:56,008 --> 00:47:57,041
我們可以坐下來好好談談
And I'll talk.

595
00:47:57,048 --> 00:47:58,095
我也很樂意跟你們好好談談
I'm happy to talk.

596
00:48:00,015 --> 00:48:02,035
但你們記住
But there is no way

597
00:48:03,085 --> 00:48:05,059
我是絕不會跟你們動手的
that I am fighting.

598
00:48:44,006 --> 00:48:45,006
你就這點能耐？
Is that it?

599
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:58,094
快跑，兒子！
Run, son!

600
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:49,059
在這等著，兒子
Wait here, son.

601
00:49:52,023 --> 00:49:53,030
快跑，兒子！
Run, son!

602
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:04,064
聖劍沒有抗拒你的操控
You are resisting the sword.

603
00:50:06,051 --> 00:50:08,064
但你的內力卻在排斥聖劍的神力
The sword isn't resisting you.

604
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:11,025
所以現在情況已經很清楚了，我能力有限
It should be clear by now,

605
00:50:11,031 --> 00:50:15,085
無論你和你的朋友想從我的身上得到什麼
that whatever it is that you and your friends think you want from me,

606
00:50:17,019 --> 00:50:19,099
我都無法給你們
I am not it.

607
00:50:20,006 --> 00:50:21,009
還沒到時候
Not yet.

608
00:50:21,009 --> 00:50:22,013
永遠都不行
Not ever!

609
00:50:23,066 --> 00:50:25,099
你雙手持劍的時候，看到了什麼？
What do you see when you hold the sword?

610
00:50:27,093 --> 00:50:31,010
是你原來曾經見到過的一些東西，對不對？
It is something you've seen before, isn't it?

611
00:50:31,017 --> 00:50:33,064
那些畫面並不是你接觸了聖劍以後才出現的，它們早就存在於你的腦海中，對吧？
Long before you ever touched the sword.

612
00:50:34,094 --> 00:50:37,071
而且你經常睡不好，對吧？
You don't sleep well, do you?

613
00:50:40,081 --> 00:50:43,051
我告訴你，我有辦法驅散那些噩夢，你願不願意試一試？
What if you could make the dreams go away?

614
00:50:51,055 --> 00:50:53,016
你知道的，為了讓他有能力掌控聖劍
You know what we have to do.

615
00:50:53,022 --> 00:50:55,063
我們必須送他去黑暗之地
In order for him
to control Excalibur,

616
00:50:55,069 --> 00:50:57,059
接受試煉
he needs to go to the Darklands.

617
00:50:57,066 --> 00:50:58,099
這絕對不行
That's not happening.

618
00:51:00,033 --> 00:51:02,060
歡迎來到黑暗之地
Welcome to the Darklands.

619
00:51:07,074 --> 00:51:09,000
那就是黑暗之地?
That's the Darklands?

620
00:51:09,007 --> 00:51:10,061
那隻是入口罷了
That's the entrance.

621
00:51:13,074 --> 00:51:15,094
他需要拿著劍，到達位於黑暗之地中的高塔
He needs to take the sword to the tower.

622
00:51:16,001 --> 00:51:18,048
你要用聖劍觸碰塔頂的祭壇石
You must touch the sword to the altar stone.

623
00:51:23,035 --> 00:51:24,055
你們會想我的喲
Gonna miss me.

624
00:51:25,029 --> 00:51:26,036
還有沒有別的辦法
Give me another way.

625
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:27,062
別無他法
There's no other way.

626
00:51:28,042 --> 00:51:30,006
而且，他必須一個人去
And he has to go alone.

627
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:41,054
他獨自一人怎麼可能在黑暗之地幸存下來
He can't survive the Darklands alone.

628
00:51:45,097 --> 00:51:46,081
你害怕?
Are you scared?

629
00:51:46,097 --> 00:51:48,021
我能應付這個
I think I can manage.

630
00:51:55,022 --> 00:51:56,072
你確實應該感到害怕
You should be scared.

631
00:52:17,061 --> 00:52:19,054
這有什麼好大驚小怪的
That's what all the fuss is about?

632
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:47,004
別急，你馬上就知道為什麼我們要大驚小怪了
Don't worry, you'll soon understand what all the fuss is about.

633
00:52:52,021 --> 00:52:54,028
關鍵在於，通過試煉後，他必然會有所改變
You don't want all of him to survive. That's the point.

634
00:52:54,034 --> 00:52:58,018
試煉的過程會拖垮他，摧毀他以前的人格
You have to break his old self completely. Wear him down.

635
00:52:58,025 --> 00:52:59,058
你不是想讓他以後帶領我們乾一番大事?
You want him to think big?

636
00:53:02,005 --> 00:53:03,089
那就先給他點挑戰，磨煉他的意志
Give him something big to think about.

637
00:53:07,096 --> 00:53:10,013
法師，你這是在玩火
You're playing with fire, Mage.

638
00:53:10,019 --> 00:53:12,063
他這還沒當上國王呢，我們這麼搞，把他弄死了，那怎麼辦？
And I'm not killing the king before he's even become one.

639
00:54:29,084 --> 00:54:31,027
在這等著，兒子
Wait here, son.

640
00:54:32,017 --> 00:54:33,018
不！
No!

641
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:24,019
兒子，快跑！
Run, son!

642
00:56:51,028 --> 00:56:54,005
以前的那些畫面，你都看到了?？
Did you see everything you needed to see?

643
00:56:54,088 --> 00:56:56,012
我都看到了
I saw enough.

644
00:56:58,092 --> 00:57:00,072
黑暗之地里的那座法師之塔
The Mage Tower.

645
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:02,052
和卡美洛城裡，伏提庚正在修建的那座一模一樣
It's the same as the one at Camelot.

646
00:57:02,059 --> 00:57:05,063
那座塔越高，伏提庚的力量就越強
The higher Vortigern builds it, the more powerful he becomes.

647
00:57:05,069 --> 00:57:09,033
高塔完工以後，他就擁有和當年莫德雷德一樣的邪惡之力了
And when it is finished, he will have the same power of Mordred.

648
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,080
所以這時候聖劍重新出現在世人面前
That is why the sword has revealed itself now.

649
00:57:12,087 --> 00:57:15,090
一物降一物
Where there's poison, there's a remedy.

650
00:57:17,004 --> 00:57:19,091
你們的族人呢？
What happened to your people?

651
00:57:19,097 --> 00:57:23,001
你的父親去世之後，你的叔叔伏提庚發動了一場針對法師的戰爭
They were murdered by your uncle.

652
00:57:23,008 --> 00:57:25,045
屠殺了無數的法師
It was Vortigern who started the wars.

653
00:57:26,051 --> 00:57:29,008
他覬覦你父親的王位
He was jealous of your father's throne.

654
00:57:29,015 --> 00:57:31,062
所以他和莫德雷德達成協議
So he made a deal with Mordred...

655
00:57:31,069 --> 00:57:33,029
他們二人共享權力
That they would share power

656
00:57:33,036 --> 00:57:36,039
伏提庚負責除掉你的父親
once he defeated your father.

657
00:57:38,013 --> 00:57:41,043
莫德雷德則殺害了法師之王
Mordred murdered the Mage King

658
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:45,073
帶著他的法杖去了原先的那座神聖之塔
and took his staff to their sacred tower,

659
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:49,044
解封了象徵著他們結盟的黑暗之力
where he unlocked the dark forces of their union.

660
00:57:54,021 --> 00:57:57,018
但他們卻沒有算計到
But what they didn't account for was the sword.

661
00:57:57,091 --> 00:58:00,088
魔法師梅林偷走了法杖
Merlin stole his staff.

662
00:58:02,058 --> 00:58:06,092
打造出了這把聖劍，又稱“王者之劍”
He then forged the great sword, Excalibur

663
00:58:06,099 --> 00:58:10,056
最後摧毀了那座神聖之塔
and destroyed the ancient tower.

664
00:58:10,063 --> 00:58:14,020
梅林把聖劍交給了湖之仙女
The sword was then passed to the Lady of the Lake

665
00:58:14,026 --> 00:58:17,057
她把聖劍的使用者限定為烏瑟·潘德拉貢及其子嗣
who bound it to the Pendragon bloodline.

666
00:58:21,077 --> 00:58:23,054
現在你的父親已經去世
Now

667
00:58:23,061 --> 00:58:27,021
這劍歸你了
the sword is yours.

668
00:58:27,028 --> 00:58:30,041
似乎亞瑟已經和反叛分子接上頭了
It seems his people have been found by the Resistance.

669
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:33,092
你手底下有一萬士兵
You have 10,000 men under your command

670
00:58:35,015 --> 00:58:37,035
負責維持秩序
for the purpose of maintaining public order.

671
00:58:37,042 --> 00:58:39,032
我已經四處佈下眼線
Informants have been incentivized.

672
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:40,099
麥西亞..
Mercia...

673
00:58:41,006 --> 00:58:42,086
士兵在主要道路上巡邏，在各個城鎮仔細搜查
Our garrisons are patrolling the roads and searching every town.

674
00:58:42,092 --> 00:58:43,079
陛下，找到他們只不過是時間問題
It's only a matter of time, Your Majesty.

675
00:58:43,082 --> 00:58:44,059
麥西亞
Mercia.

676
00:58:44,066 --> 00:58:46,036
陛下不必多慮，反叛軍從未造成實質性威脅
The Resistance have never posed any real threat.

677
00:58:46,043 --> 00:58:47,050
麥西亞！
Mercia!

678
00:58:51,017 --> 00:58:54,007
你他媽的做好本職工作就行
Just do your fucking job.

679
00:58:56,091 --> 00:58:58,057
抓住他
Find him.

680
00:59:08,088 --> 00:59:10,032
這劍比我想象中的要小
Smaller than I thought it'd be.

681
00:59:10,039 --> 00:59:12,052
想要麼？送你了，小子
It's all yours, son.

682
00:59:12,059 --> 00:59:14,032
不過我要先提醒你一下，這劍的力量很是強大
I warn you, it's got quite a bite.

683
00:59:16,069 --> 00:59:18,019
我們的地盤那邊怎麼樣了
What they done back home?

684
00:59:19,086 --> 00:59:21,093
你做好心理準備了?？
You really wanna know?

685
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,023
什麼都沒了
It's all gone.

686
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:25,053
都被付之一炬了
They torched the lot.

687
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:29,010
繼續說
I said, go on.

688
00:59:29,017 --> 00:59:31,087
他們這是很給你面子了
You should be flattered, mate.

689
00:59:31,094 --> 00:59:35,064
黑甲軍司令麥西亞親自帶人找你和聖劍的下落
Even Mercia left the castle to look for you and that sword.

690
00:59:38,085 --> 00:59:40,028
傑克背叛了我們
Jack's Eye turned.

691
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:43,055
供出了所有你跟他之間的秘密
Gave 'em a list of everything you valued.

692
00:59:43,062 --> 00:59:46,045
那天晚上，附近的居民有一半在屠殺中喪命
They slaughtered half the neighborhood.

693
00:59:47,029 --> 00:59:50,013
“破壞狂”約翰自然也沒閑著
Mischief John got busy.

694
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:52,026
他一把火燒了那座橋
Personally burned down the bridge.

695
00:59:53,009 --> 00:59:55,003
當時很是慘烈
It was quite a party.

696
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:56,083
我還要繼續說下去?？
Shall I continue?

697
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:59,027
我們幫里剩下的人呢？
What about the rest of the team?

698
00:59:59,033 --> 01:00:01,054
大部分的女孩都跟我們倆
Most of the girls are with us...

699
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:04,064
其餘的人大概是聽說了你的事之後
But the rest of the crew pretty much got gist of your popularity

700
01:00:04,071 --> 01:00:06,017
嚇著了，找地方避風頭去了
and made themselves scarce.

701
01:00:07,084 --> 01:00:09,091
布魯，去給我們找點喝的來
Blue, go get us something to drink.

702
01:00:09,098 --> 01:00:11,075
還有什麼我不能聽的，老大，我是你們中的一員啊
Come on, boss. I'm one of the crew.

703
01:00:11,081 --> 01:00:13,022
兒子，聽話！
Blue!

704
01:00:25,013 --> 01:00:26,056
我沒事，不用扶我
I'm all right!

705
01:00:54,086 --> 01:00:57,009
我要親手殺了伏提庚
I'm gonna kill him.

706
01:00:57,016 --> 01:00:59,036
這麼些年來，躲在這的人一直想殺他吧
This lot have been trying to do it for years.

707
01:00:59,043 --> 01:01:02,013
聽你這麼說他們肯定會感到很高興
They'd love to hear you say that.

708
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:06,000
等了這麼久，他們終於盼來了那個能掌控聖劍的人
They've waited a long time to see a man pull this sword.

709
01:01:06,007 --> 01:01:08,010
我不只是為了他們而戰
I'm not doing this for them.

710
01:01:09,004 --> 01:01:10,051
威特
Wet Stick,

711
01:01:11,024 --> 01:01:12,074
這位是珀西瓦爾
meet Percival.

712
01:01:14,064 --> 01:01:17,008
盧比奧，這位是拜克·萊克
Rubio, meet Back Lack.

713
01:01:17,014 --> 01:01:18,058
這位是貝德維爾爵士
Sir Bedivere,

714
01:01:18,065 --> 01:01:22,012
他是這兒的老大
who runs this aristocratic family of cave dwellers,

715
01:01:22,018 --> 01:01:25,009
這位是布魯，拜克·萊克的兒子
meet Blue, son of Back Lack.

716
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:27,022
這位是臭名昭著的“肥鵝”比爾
The infamous Goosefat Bill

717
01:01:27,029 --> 01:01:28,089
大概就不用我多介紹了
needs no introduction.

718
01:01:28,096 --> 01:01:30,079
所以..
So...

719
01:01:30,086 --> 01:01:33,013
你覺得我們能擊敗伏提庚?？
You think you can take down Vortigern?

720
01:01:33,019 --> 01:01:35,063
全英格蘭總共有12位男爵
There are 12 barons.

721
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:37,090
他們代表著英格蘭最古老的12個家族
These represent the old families of England.

722
01:01:37,097 --> 01:01:41,027
他們總共能集結起約一萬兩千名士兵
Between them, they can rustle up 12,000 warriors.

723
01:01:41,034 --> 01:01:43,040
我們要是想成功的話，至少得爭取到
In order to stand a chance, we are going to need

724
01:01:43,047 --> 01:01:45,041
其中幾位的支持
at least some of their support.

725
01:01:45,047 --> 01:01:47,044
我可以安排同其中六個家族的代表見面
We can arrange a meeting with six of those families...

726
01:01:47,051 --> 01:01:49,048
如果可以的話
Let me stop you there.

727
01:01:49,055 --> 01:01:51,028
容我打斷你一下
If I may...

728
01:01:51,035 --> 01:01:53,025
請允許我推測一下，若是我們同他們見面了
Allow me to run you through the

729
01:01:53,025 --> 01:01:55,025
該會有怎樣的對話
proceedings as I think they will unfold.

730
01:01:55,032 --> 01:01:57,015
他們會告訴我們
They'll start by telling us...

731
01:01:57,022 --> 01:02:00,015
如果你打算呼籲這個國家的人民
If you're intending to galvanize the people of this country

732
01:02:00,022 --> 01:02:01,066
推翻現有的國王
against the current king,

733
01:02:01,072 --> 01:02:03,056
那我們需要一個可行的策略
there has to be a realistic strategy.

734
01:02:03,063 --> 01:02:05,056
提出一個可行的策略，需要非凡的領導才能
Strategy requires leadership.

735
01:02:05,063 --> 01:02:07,033
然後，他們會沒完沒了的吹噓
Then they'll bang on for a while

736
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:10,013
他們有多麼的聰明，他們接受了怎樣優秀的教育
about how clever and educated they are.

737
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:12,090
學習了戰爭，外交的知識，接受了騎士精神的熏陶
In the art of war, diplomacy, and chivalry.

738
01:02:12,097 --> 01:02:14,050
然後他們會轉而諷刺我是多麼的不夠格
And how underqualified I am.

739
01:02:14,057 --> 01:02:16,080
這家伙不是在妓院里長大的?？
Is it not true that this man was raised in a brothel

740
01:02:16,087 --> 01:02:18,067
而且他從未接受過正規教育
and has no formal education of any kind?

741
01:02:18,074 --> 01:02:20,031
然後他們會開始人身攻擊
Then they'll start takin' the piss.

742
01:02:20,038 --> 01:02:22,048
而且，貝德維爾，我們要怎麼稱呼他？
And what are we to be called, Bedivere?

743
01:02:22,054 --> 01:02:24,055
“妓院騎士”？
"Knights of the Bordello"?

744
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:27,092
還是“青樓騎士”？
Or "The Ladies of the Knight".

745
01:02:29,025 --> 01:02:31,025
你們說完了?？
Have you finished?

746
01:02:31,032 --> 01:02:32,060
我肯定要回擊他們
I'm gonna have to pull 'em on it.

747
01:02:32,065 --> 01:02:35,006
不錯，你們還挺有幽默感
I'm glad you've got a sense of humor.

748
01:02:35,012 --> 01:02:36,024
待會你們恐怕就笑不出來了
'Cause you're gonna need it.

749
01:02:36,026 --> 01:02:38,003
我肯定會回敬他們
I'm gonna be forced to tell them...

750
01:02:38,009 --> 01:02:39,049
你們這幫懦弱的廢物
There's not a bollock between you.

751
01:02:39,056 --> 01:02:40,080
這時候，我猜貝德維爾
At which point, Bedivere,

752
01:02:40,086 --> 01:02:42,080
會勃然大怒，叫我住口
you're gonna get very angry, and tell me off.

753
01:02:42,086 --> 01:02:45,030
我估計你會這麼說
You'll say something along the lines of...

754
01:02:45,037 --> 01:02:46,063
如果他們要揍你的話
"What were you gonna do

755
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:47,094
你要怎麼辦，我會這麼回答
"if they wanted to fight?" And I'm gonna say,

756
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,047
我不會跟他們動手的
"I was never gonna fight".

757
01:02:49,054 --> 01:02:51,017
然後你會追問，“那我們要怎麼辦”
And you're gonna say, "Well, what was gonna happen?"

758
01:02:51,024 --> 01:02:52,061
然後我會回答，“貝德維爾，我早就跟你說了，他們這幫懦夫幫不上我們的忙”
And I was gonna say, "That's why you're here, Bedivere,

759
01:02:52,067 --> 01:02:54,058
“你個蠢貨還讓我們白跑一趟”
"you big, silly, posh bastard".

760
01:02:58,095 --> 01:03:01,035
你是想讓伏提庚現身
You want Vortigern to stick his neck out,

761
01:03:01,042 --> 01:03:03,045
想讓他去一趟倫底紐姆，對吧
and get him to Londinium?

762
01:03:03,052 --> 01:03:05,042
想要引蛇出洞
You need to tease it out.

763
01:03:05,049 --> 01:03:08,036
用不著一萬兩千名士兵
You don't need 12,000 fighting men for that.

764
01:03:08,042 --> 01:03:11,009
我們這群人就夠了
What you need is this little rabble.

765
01:03:11,016 --> 01:03:13,009
所以你具體打算怎麼辦
Okay, so how's that gonna work?

766
01:03:13,016 --> 01:03:15,050
貝德維爾，如果你的思維不夠靈活
If I'm moving too fast for you, Bedivere,

767
01:03:15,056 --> 01:03:17,097
那讓我來當領導吧
you can let yourself out the side door.

768
01:03:18,003 --> 01:03:20,084
喲，你排擠人來可算得上是輕車熟路啊
You seem to have found your way very quickly.

769
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:23,064
哈哈，老兄，做飯去吧
Now, come on, kid. You're cooking dinner.

770
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:27,091
大家開動腦筋想想，伏提庚目前最關心的事是什麼
What is it that Vortigern cares about most in the world?

771
01:03:27,098 --> 01:03:29,064
殺掉你
Killing you.

772
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:31,015
除了這個
Apart from that.

773
01:03:31,021 --> 01:03:32,048
拿到聖劍
Getting the sword.

774
01:03:32,055 --> 01:03:34,035
還有呢？
Could someone help me out here, please?

775
01:03:34,041 --> 01:03:35,072
建成那座高塔
Finishing his tower.

776
01:03:35,078 --> 01:03:38,012
那我們要怎麼阻撓他建成高塔
So what do we do about it?

777
01:03:38,019 --> 01:03:39,099
擊沉運輸石料的駁船，堵塞航道
Sink his barges carrying his supply of stone. Block up the river.

778
01:03:40,005 --> 01:03:42,022
伙計們，我們直接把艙壁打破不就行了?，多省事
Chaps, wouldn't it be easier just to go through the side?

779
01:03:42,029 --> 01:03:44,073
看到了吧，這就是讀書太多的毛病
See? That's the problem with an education.

780
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:45,089
讀書太多，腦子不行了
It gets in the way.

781
01:03:45,096 --> 01:03:48,040
這些駁船的船側是由風乾的橡木板製成
These boats are made out of seasoned oak.

782
01:03:48,046 --> 01:03:49,096
牢不可摧
They're uncrackable.

783
01:03:50,003 --> 01:03:52,000
所以你得先打破甲板，再打斷龍骨，船就沉了
So you need to go through the deck to get to the keel.

784
01:03:52,007 --> 01:03:56,014
不對，你得先打破船底的隔板，然後再打穿船尾
No, you need to go through the bulkhead to get to the stern.

785
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:57,027
你在乾啥呢
What are you doing?

786
01:03:57,034 --> 01:03:58,087
別浪費時間了
You're wasting your time.

787
01:03:58,094 --> 01:04:00,094
我跟你說過了，艙壁是相當結實的
I've told you they're uncrackable.

788
01:04:02,018 --> 01:04:03,071
威特，拜克·萊克，看到了沒？
See, Wet Stick, Back Lack?

789
01:04:03,078 --> 01:04:06,068
這就是知識的力量
That's what an education gets ya.

790
01:04:06,075 --> 01:04:08,095
陛下，十分抱歉
My sincere apologies, Your Majesty.

791
01:04:09,002 --> 01:04:11,059
運石船都沉了，河道也被堵塞了
The stone barges have been sunk, and they've blocked the river.

792
01:04:11,065 --> 01:04:13,079
還有?，再多想些點子
What else?
Come on, more ideas.

793
01:04:13,086 --> 01:04:15,092
切斷勞動力供應
Interrupt his supply of slaves.

794
01:04:15,099 --> 01:04:17,059
很好，我們具體要怎麼做
Excellent. How are we gonna do that?

795
01:04:17,066 --> 01:04:19,039
他們知道黑甲軍押送奴隸的路線
We know their transportation routes.

796
01:04:19,046 --> 01:04:21,036
不錯，我們開始進入狀態了
Oof! Now we're warmin' up.

797
01:04:32,027 --> 01:04:34,044
大家繼續開動腦筋
Come on, ideas.

798
01:04:34,051 --> 01:04:36,054
燒毀他最愛的宮殿
Burn his favorite palace down.

799
01:04:36,061 --> 01:04:38,005
那我們要怎麼做？
How you gonna do that, then?

800
01:04:38,011 --> 01:04:40,007
我認識一位酒品供應商
I know the man that supplies brandy to the palace.

801
01:04:40,011 --> 01:04:41,025
他每個月初往那座宮殿里運白蘭地
Shipment first of the month.

802
01:04:41,032 --> 01:04:42,068
伙計，這送的是果酒還是白蘭地？
All right, Dan. Wine or brandy?

803
01:04:42,075 --> 01:04:43,079
白蘭地
Brandy.

804
01:04:43,085 --> 01:04:44,079
開門
Open the doors.

805
01:04:50,056 --> 01:04:51,096
簡直浪費了那些好酒
What a waste of brandy.

806
01:04:52,003 --> 01:04:54,083
也沒浪費啊，看那火燒得挺旺的呢
But doesn't it make the palace burn well?

807
01:04:56,050 --> 01:04:59,053
總共有一萬個孩子，年齡都在十二歲以下
10,000 boys. All under 12 years.

808
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:01,027
他們還年輕，只要培養一段時間，他們就會忘記他們的家庭
Young enough to forget their families,

809
01:05:01,034 --> 01:05:03,034
只會忠誠於你們
and to have no other loyalty than to you.

810
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:06,007
另外，只要保證我們的船隻能安全通過你們的海域
Plus, 5,000 more each year

811
01:05:06,014 --> 01:05:09,031
我們每年多給你們送五千人
for as long as you grant us passage through your seas.

812
01:05:09,038 --> 01:05:10,085
北方的土地是我們的吧？
The north is ours?

813
01:05:10,091 --> 01:05:12,035
是你們的，我們會遵守協議
That is our agreement.

814
01:05:23,049 --> 01:05:24,096
還有什麼疑問?？
Is there a problem?

815
01:05:28,083 --> 01:05:31,050
尊敬的陛下，現在流言四起
There are rumors, Great King.

816
01:05:31,057 --> 01:05:32,083
我的國家與這裡隔海相望
Even across the seas

817
01:05:32,090 --> 01:05:36,061
就連在我們那邊，都聽到了有關
we have heard the legend of the sword,

818
01:05:37,034 --> 01:05:39,014
王者之劍
of a king

819
01:05:39,021 --> 01:05:41,091
和另外一位國王的傳說
other than yourself.

820
01:05:41,098 --> 01:05:45,071
因此我受吾王之命，問您一個問題
I would be doing my own king a disservice

821
01:05:45,078 --> 01:05:48,065
若有冒犯請您多多海涵
if I did not ask this question.

822
01:05:51,069 --> 01:05:53,056
我國國君同陛下之間達成的協議確實有效?？
Are the boys yours to give?

823
01:05:53,062 --> 01:05:56,086
你覺得你是應該聽信謠言
Do you really consider your faith better served by a rumor?

824
01:05:56,093 --> 01:06:00,033
還是應該相信全英格蘭的征服者
Or by the word of the conqueror of this island

825
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:04,037
國王的麾下可有十萬名驍勇善戰之士呢
with an army of 100,000 souls behind his sword?

826
01:06:12,094 --> 01:06:17,041
我絕對沒有冒犯您的意思，尊敬的陛下
I meant no disrespect, Great King.

827
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:36,040
父親，您有事找我?？
You asked to see me, Father?

828
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:41,013
我需要獲得全體十二位男爵的支持
We need the support of all the barons.

829
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:43,027
在倫底紐姆召開一次會議
Set a meeting in Londinium

830
01:06:43,034 --> 01:06:45,001
尤其是那六個搖擺不定的，一定要叫過來
for the six we doubt.

831
01:06:45,007 --> 01:06:48,094
還有，不惜一切代價，抓住亞瑟
Whatever it takes to hunt him down.

832
01:07:26,041 --> 01:07:27,098
我還是控制不了這把劍
I still can't control it.

833
01:07:28,005 --> 01:07:29,008
拿起它
Pick it up.

834
01:07:29,065 --> 01:07:31,019
你自己來拿
You pick it up.

835
01:07:31,025 --> 01:07:32,062
雙手拿起它
Pick it up with both hands.

836
01:07:35,066 --> 01:07:38,046
難道你沒有看到所需看到的一切?？
Did you see everything you needed to see?

837
01:07:38,053 --> 01:07:39,079
你說在哪的時候？
Where?

838
01:07:39,079 --> 01:07:41,006
在黑暗之地的時候
In the Darklands.

839
01:07:42,006 --> 01:07:43,043
在高塔上的聖壇前，你是不是曾試圖逃避自己的過去
Did you look away?

840
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:48,067
你想知道你為什麼還是控制不了它?？
You want to know why you still can't use it.

841
01:07:48,074 --> 01:07:50,011
聽起來你知道答案，那你告訴我啊
Why don't you tell me?

842
01:07:50,017 --> 01:07:52,061
我覺得你自己能悟出答案
I think you know the answer.

843
01:07:52,067 --> 01:07:56,014
等到你真正需要使用聖劍的時候，你就明白了
You will face it when it's worth it to you.

844
01:07:56,021 --> 01:07:59,025
別誤會了我的意思，我們都曾試圖逃避自己的過去
Don't get me wrong, I look away.

845
01:07:59,031 --> 01:08:01,092
所有人都曾試圖逃避自己的過去
We all look away.

846
01:08:01,098 --> 01:08:04,095
但真正的王者，是有勇氣面對過去的
But that is the difference between a man and a king.

847
01:08:13,049 --> 01:08:15,046
麥琪，你怎麼來了
Maggie!

848
01:08:15,053 --> 01:08:18,023
我記得我們都說好了，你再也
I thought we agreed that you'd never come here.

849
01:08:18,030 --> 01:08:20,013
你先聽聽她帶來的消息
You need to hear this.

850
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:23,037
伏提庚要去倫底紐姆，跟十二位男爵會面
Vortigern is making a visit to Londinium to meet with the barons.

851
01:08:23,044 --> 01:08:24,044
他會坐船過去
He will travel by barge.

852
01:08:24,044 --> 01:08:25,054
什麼時候？
When?

853
01:08:26,057 --> 01:08:27,091
三天后
Three days from now.

854
01:08:27,098 --> 01:08:29,048
嗯，不錯
Hmm.

855
01:08:29,054 --> 01:08:31,075
看來你的計劃奏效了
Looks like your plan worked.

856
01:08:31,081 --> 01:08:33,052
你們行動的時候要小心
You need to be careful.

857
01:08:34,038 --> 01:08:36,059
伏提庚的黑暗力量日漸上升
His power is increasing.

858
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:33,011
這棟房子的位置不錯
The building's right.

859
01:09:33,017 --> 01:09:36,004
角度也很合適，共有三個出城口
The angle's right. Three exits from which to leave the city.

860
01:09:36,011 --> 01:09:39,055
站在射擊點可以俯瞰整座碼頭和大半個城區
A vantage point over the whole dock and most of the town.

861
01:09:39,061 --> 01:09:40,078
射擊距離46米
It's a 50-yard shot.

862
01:09:40,085 --> 01:09:42,062
小菜一碟，還有其它問題?
I can do that easily. What's the problem?

863
01:09:42,068 --> 01:09:43,089
有，你解釋給他聽聽
Tell him.

864
01:09:43,095 --> 01:09:45,019
伙計，我來給你分析一下
Tell you what the problem is, mate.

865
01:09:45,025 --> 01:09:46,062
那棟房子的位置是挺合適，問題在於，房子的主人比較難對付
When you say the building's right,

866
01:09:46,069 --> 01:09:48,021
我認識那棟房子的主人
I know the man that owns that building.

867
01:09:48,026 --> 01:09:50,002
他可沒興趣讓任何人進他的屋子裡
And he's not interested in letting anyone in.

868
01:09:50,006 --> 01:09:51,076
我們想刺殺伏提庚，借你的屋頂用用成?
How do you feel about a rooftop king assassination?

869
01:09:51,082 --> 01:09:52,073
這棟房子的屋頂？
My roof?

870
01:09:52,073 --> 01:09:53,063
對
Yeah.

871
01:09:53,069 --> 01:09:55,053
他可犯不著因為我們的行動而喪命
And least of all the king's assassins that he'll have to hang for.

872
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:56,043
要是你們被髮現了，我豈不是會人頭落地？
I'd hang?

873
01:09:56,043 --> 01:09:57,026
也許吧
Probably.

874
01:09:58,037 --> 01:10:00,043
而且，說是說有三個出城口，但到時候能用的只有一個
The three exits are actually only one.

875
01:10:00,050 --> 01:10:02,030
一旦觸發警報
'Cause once the alarm arrow's fired

876
01:10:02,037 --> 01:10:04,024
其中兩個城門會在兩分鐘內關上
the gates will be shut within two minutes

877
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:06,054
而我們連跑到城門口，都要六分鐘
and they're six minutes away by foot.

878
01:10:06,061 --> 01:10:09,098
除非你能跑的像兔子一樣快，那另當別論
Unless you can run like a Neapolitan stallion, I'd forget them.

879
01:10:10,004 --> 01:10:12,015
所以最後能通過的只有一個出口
So, you have one exit remaining.

880
01:10:12,021 --> 01:10:14,031
而在離這座城門18米的地方，有一座酒吧
And that has a tavern 20 yards from it.

881
01:10:14,038 --> 01:10:16,088
那座酒吧里的黑甲兵
There's always more Blacklegs in the Two Hot Cocks

882
01:10:16,095 --> 01:10:18,059
比路上的老鼠還多
than there are rats on the street.

883
01:10:18,065 --> 01:10:20,045
那為什麼不換個射擊點呢？
Why don't you use the other building?

884
01:10:20,052 --> 01:10:21,072
比如在這怎麼樣
The one back here?

885
01:10:22,082 --> 01:10:25,006
這射擊距離可有170米
Because it's 175 yards away.

886
01:10:25,013 --> 01:10:27,016
拜克·萊克，你射箭能射多遠？
And how far can you shoot, Back Lack?

887
01:10:27,023 --> 01:10:29,070
要想射的準的話，70米之內吧
Accurately? 75.

888
01:10:29,076 --> 01:10:31,057
比爾呢？
Bill?

889
01:10:31,063 --> 01:10:32,057
160米可以
175.

890
01:10:32,063 --> 01:10:33,067
60米，這和萊克差不多嘛..
Same as...

891
01:10:33,073 --> 01:10:36,027
你聽錯了，他說的是160米
No, he said, "175."

892
01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:39,027
兄弟，說起來容易做起來難啊
All right, mate, of course you can.

893
01:10:49,058 --> 01:10:52,049
這差不多有160米了吧
That's about 175 yards, isn't it?

894
01:10:52,055 --> 01:10:54,052
他這會兒應該發信號了
Well, he was supposed to signal.

895
01:10:54,059 --> 01:10:55,072
我們看不到他啊
Can't see him.

896
01:10:55,079 --> 01:10:57,009
我們既然看不到他
Well, if can't see them,

897
01:10:57,016 --> 01:10:59,019
他也肯定看不到我們
then they can't see us.

898
01:10:59,026 --> 01:11:00,033
搞什麼鬼！
Hey!

899
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,027
說不定他們以為你射中只不過是運氣好罷了
Maybe they thought that was luck.

900
01:11:06,033 --> 01:11:07,087
你這樣會出人命的！
That could've killed us.

901
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:12,097
你的朋友尖叫起來像娘們一樣
They scream like girls, your friends.

902
01:11:20,001 --> 01:11:23,035
我看到那條“頭狼”（麥西亞）了
The wolf at the head of the pack.

903
01:11:23,042 --> 01:11:24,089
比爾
Goosefat...

904
01:11:24,095 --> 01:11:26,022
一切正常?
Everything all right?

905
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:28,029
比爾！
Goosefat!

906
01:11:28,029 --> 01:11:29,009
沒事
Mmm.

907
01:11:29,016 --> 01:11:30,062
“頭狼”是誰？是不是還有什麼我不知道的事？
Is there something I should know here?

908
01:11:30,069 --> 01:11:32,016
那是黑甲軍司令官麥西亞，比爾跟他有過節
Those two have a history.

909
01:11:32,023 --> 01:11:34,053
我不清楚你們之間的恩怨糾葛，但我們今天不是來殺他的
Well, whatever it is, that's not what we're here for.

910
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:35,059
不能感情用事，對吧，比爾？
Is it, Goosefat?

911
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:38,036
伏提庚到了
They've arrived.

912
01:11:38,043 --> 01:11:40,074
麥琪，我現在才意識到你的家族對我來說
Maggie, I now realize what an important

913
01:11:40,074 --> 01:11:42,074
是多麼的重要
member of my household you are.

914
01:11:43,027 --> 01:11:44,030
陛下...
Your Majesty...

915
01:11:44,037 --> 01:11:45,041
我還沒說完
I haven't finished.

916
01:11:46,047 --> 01:11:47,091
坐下
Sit down.

917
01:11:49,061 --> 01:11:51,048
直到最近我才意識到
Till recently...

918
01:11:51,055 --> 01:11:55,035
只要用得好，你會是一個相當有用的工具
I didn't recognize what a powerful tool you can be in the right hands.

919
01:11:55,042 --> 01:11:57,059
我原來以為你只是個無名小卒
I thought you were simply a pawn.

920
01:11:57,065 --> 01:12:00,059
現在才發現你的作用舉足輕重
Turns out you're a far more significant piece.

921
01:12:00,065 --> 01:12:03,009
考慮到反叛分子同你暗中勾結，試圖推翻我的統治
And it would be witless of me

922
01:12:03,016 --> 01:12:06,013
我要是不將你為我所用
not to use that to my advantage,

923
01:12:06,019 --> 01:12:08,090
那我就太不明智了
given how effectively you've been used against me.

924
01:12:10,073 --> 01:12:13,030
向國王致敬！
Hail to the king!

925
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:14,047
伏提庚來了
There's the king.

926
01:12:23,031 --> 01:12:25,071
我覺得有點不太對勁
Something doesn't smell right.

927
01:12:33,055 --> 01:12:34,092
這也太順利了吧
This is too easy.

928
01:12:36,099 --> 01:12:38,086
慢著，先別放箭
Wait. Wait, wait. Don't fire.

929
01:12:38,093 --> 01:12:39,093
為什麼？
Why not?

930
01:12:39,093 --> 01:12:40,093
我感覺不太對
Something doesn't smell right.

931
01:12:40,099 --> 01:12:43,036
這可是千載難逢的機會，別讓你所謂的直覺毀了我們的行動
It smells as right as it's ever going to smell.

932
01:12:43,043 --> 01:12:45,040
快動手啊，伏提庚就在那裡
Come on, he's right there.

933
01:12:45,047 --> 01:12:47,010
比爾，快動手
Bill! Get on with it!

934
01:12:47,017 --> 01:12:48,020
這是個陷阱
It's a trap.

935
01:12:48,027 --> 01:12:49,052
有理由?
How would he know?

936
01:12:49,052 --> 01:12:50,077
我也不確定，也許問題出在麥琪身上
Don't know. Maggie.

937
01:12:50,084 --> 01:12:52,091
也許伏提庚知道她跟我們暗中保持聯繫
Maybe he knows she's working for us.

938
01:12:52,097 --> 01:12:55,081
我敢肯定，站在那的，只是個伏提庚的替身
I am telling you. That is not the king.

939
01:12:58,018 --> 01:13:01,028
別四處張望，看著我就行
Stop looking around and look at me.

940
01:13:01,035 --> 01:13:02,098
我是個誘餌，對吧？
I'm a target, aren't I?

941
01:13:03,005 --> 01:13:05,042
我的天，他們怎麼找來了這樣一個蠢貨
God help us. They've sent me a buffoon.

942
01:13:06,095 --> 01:13:10,002
伏提庚，你真是個狡猾的老混蛋
You are a cunning old bastard, Vortigern.

943
01:13:10,009 --> 01:13:11,089
但你不明白的是
But what you fail to understand

944
01:13:11,096 --> 01:13:14,069
你這是在自掘墳墓
is that it's you who's fed the hangman

945
01:13:14,076 --> 01:13:16,020
總有一天，你會遭到報應的
that will eventually come for you.

946
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,097
你說的沒錯，那隻是個替身
You're right, that's not Vortigern.

947
01:13:19,003 --> 01:13:20,077
但至少今天我可以了結麥西亞的狗命
But at least Mercia's here.

948
01:13:21,047 --> 01:13:22,080
比爾，別亂來！
Goosefat.

949
01:13:27,011 --> 01:13:29,041
你瘋了?，你這一箭射出去，豈不是中了他們的圈套
What have you done?
You can't shoot if it's a trap!

950
01:13:29,048 --> 01:13:31,008
他們不可能知道箭是從哪射來的
They'll never know where that came from.

951
01:13:32,091 --> 01:13:34,028
不管怎麼說，你射偏了
You missed him anyway.

952
01:13:35,052 --> 01:13:36,082
搞笑，我怎麼可能射偏
I didn't miss anyone.

953
01:13:43,052 --> 01:13:44,053
放警告箭！
Arrow!

954
01:13:52,013 --> 01:13:53,080
你在幹嘛呢，那些都不是我們的目標啊
What are you doing? They're not targets at a fair!

955
01:13:53,087 --> 01:13:56,000
倒下去的那個是克拉倫登，他罪惡多端，死有餘辜！
That was Clarendon. He earned that.

956
01:13:58,047 --> 01:13:59,097
也許今天你能逃過一劫
You might survive today...

957
01:14:01,004 --> 01:14:02,094
但你終究難逃一死
But the noose has been tied.

958
01:14:06,095 --> 01:14:07,095
我們要撤了，快走！
We need to go. Now!

959
01:14:08,002 --> 01:14:10,012
別殺了，我們現在就走，快！
Now. We need to go now.

960
01:14:19,099 --> 01:14:21,043
關上城門！
Close the gates!

961
01:14:41,052 --> 01:14:43,008
小子們，站住
Hello, boys. Wait, wait.

962
01:14:43,015 --> 01:14:44,065
嘿，你們這麼急匆匆的是要去哪呢？
Hey, hey, hey. Where are you going?

963
01:14:44,072 --> 01:14:45,092
站住
Stop.

964
01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:52,019
嘿，轉過來
Oi! Oi!

965
01:14:54,013 --> 01:14:55,040
動手！
Sarge!

966
01:14:56,026 --> 01:14:57,066
住手！
Hey! Stop!

967
01:15:02,090 --> 01:15:04,004
該死的
Fuck me.

968
01:15:08,074 --> 01:15:09,044
我們快走！
Let's go!

969
01:15:09,051 --> 01:15:11,025
我腿受傷了，走不快，你們先走
I'm holding you up. Go on without me.

970
01:15:12,001 --> 01:15:13,008
我到安全屋跟你們會合
No, I'll see you at the safe house.

971
01:15:13,015 --> 01:15:14,041
- 我不會拋下你的  - 快走！
- I'm not leaving you! - Just go!

972
01:15:16,042 --> 01:15:17,045
他們往那邊逃了！
There they are!

973
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,020
快走！
Move!

974
01:15:43,061 --> 01:15:45,038
走這邊！
This way, this way.

975
01:15:46,045 --> 01:15:47,091
我們走！
Let's go!

976
01:15:47,098 --> 01:15:50,059
快走！
Move! Move! Move!

977
01:15:50,065 --> 01:15:53,039
快走！
Move!

978
01:16:00,003 --> 01:16:01,023
快走！
Move!

979
01:16:15,081 --> 01:16:17,011
別擋道！
Get out of the way!

980
01:16:17,011 --> 01:16:18,041
往左走，快！
Left! Go left!

981
01:16:18,048 --> 01:16:19,055
他們在這！
Over here!

982
01:16:31,039 --> 01:16:33,009
往這邊走
Hey. Here.

983
01:16:34,023 --> 01:16:35,070
進去，走這邊
In here. This way!

984
01:16:58,025 --> 01:16:59,049
此地不宜久留
We can't stay here.

985
01:17:00,072 --> 01:17:01,089
萊克呢
Where's Lack?

986
01:17:01,096 --> 01:17:03,066
- 他自己一個人逃走了 - 好吧
- He's making his own way. - All right.

987
01:17:03,072 --> 01:17:05,006
盧比奧傷勢怎麼樣
How's Rubio?

988
01:17:05,006 --> 01:17:06,039
在流血，但一時半會死不了
He's leaking, but he'll live.

989
01:17:06,046 --> 01:17:08,090
我們得趕緊去安全屋
We need to get to the old bathhouse.

990
01:17:08,096 --> 01:17:10,046
要是待會我死了
If I go down, you follow him.

991
01:17:10,053 --> 01:17:12,067
你們就跟著他走
If he goes down, you follow me.

992
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:14,060
快
Come on.

993
01:17:30,069 --> 01:17:32,035
那邊黑甲兵太多了，走這邊
There's too many. This way!

994
01:17:33,045 --> 01:17:34,055
快！
Come on!

995
01:17:34,062 --> 01:17:36,032
兄弟們，快走！
Come on, guys!

996
01:17:40,009 --> 01:17:41,019
你撐得住?
Can you make it?

997
01:17:41,026 --> 01:17:42,046
我能撐住，沒問題
I can make it, no problem.

998
01:17:47,010 --> 01:17:48,010
他們在這！
Over here!

999
01:17:48,017 --> 01:17:49,047
快來人！
Hey! Come on!

1000
01:17:56,091 --> 01:17:57,075
盧比奧！
Rubio!

1001
01:17:57,075 --> 01:17:58,058
快回來！
Come back!

1002
01:17:58,065 --> 01:17:59,065
盧比奧！
Rubio!

1003
01:18:01,011 --> 01:18:02,035
快走！
Come on!

1004
01:18:08,032 --> 01:18:09,066
他們需要你的幫助
They need your help.

1005
01:18:26,021 --> 01:18:28,028
喬治，把門鎖上
Lock the door, George.

1006
01:18:33,011 --> 01:18:34,028
喬治，讓兄弟們從下水道這邊逃出去
Get the lads out the back door, George.

1007
01:18:34,035 --> 01:18:35,062
老大，這是不可能的
It's not gonna happen, boss.

1008
01:18:35,068 --> 01:18:36,092
我們都恨死黑甲軍了，一直想狠揍他們一頓呢
They hate the Blackleg and love a fight.

1009
01:18:36,098 --> 01:18:38,029
黑甲兵人數太多，我們打不過他們的
There's too many of them.

1010
01:18:38,035 --> 01:18:40,005
不用擔心，我們訓練了這麼久，就是為了戰鬥
It's not gonna happen. They live for this.

1011
01:18:40,012 --> 01:18:41,056
喬治，他們會丟掉性命的！
They're gonna die, George!

1012
01:18:41,062 --> 01:18:43,056
我們不怕死，訓練了這麼久，就是為了今天
They trained their whole lives for this.

1013
01:19:00,098 --> 01:19:01,064
我們準備走了
Let go. Let go.

1014
01:19:12,002 --> 01:19:13,025
快追！
Come on! Move!

1015
01:19:13,032 --> 01:19:14,005
準備戰鬥！
Fight!

1016
01:19:14,085 --> 01:19:17,032
你們兩個，快下去，出口直接通往河邊
You two, down here. It's a straight run to the river.

1017
01:19:17,039 --> 01:19:19,026
你先撤吧
You go first.

1018
01:19:19,033 --> 01:19:20,096
比爾，沒時間爭了，你先走
We don't have time to argue, Bill.

1019
01:19:21,003 --> 01:19:23,046
來不及了，我們中只有一部分人能逃出去，剩下的得留下來戰鬥
Some of us will make it out in time. Some of us won't.

1020
01:19:23,053 --> 01:19:25,070
能逃出去幾個是幾個，快點！
Well, better some than none!

1021
01:19:25,077 --> 01:19:26,087
我不走，要走你先走
You go first.

1022
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:31,094
麥克，快從這撤出去
Mike! Get down the hole.

1023
01:19:32,001 --> 01:19:34,014
麥克，快從這撤出去
Mike, get down the hole.

1024
01:19:34,021 --> 01:19:35,048
老大，我討厭下水道里的老鼠
Don't like rats, boss.

1025
01:19:37,001 --> 01:19:38,008
戴爾，你先走
Dell.

1026
01:19:38,008 --> 01:19:39,015
老大，我怕黑
Scared of the dark.

1027
01:19:39,021 --> 01:19:40,081
是??
Really?

1028
01:19:40,088 --> 01:19:42,088
喬治，你快勸他們撤啊
George, will you tell them?

1029
01:19:42,095 --> 01:19:44,002
抱歉，老大，恕難從命
Sorry, boss.

1030
01:19:44,008 --> 01:19:45,049
武器準備！
Weapons!

1031
01:19:49,076 --> 01:19:51,023
你們這群混蛋
You silly bastards.

1032
01:19:52,003 --> 01:19:54,036
都他媽不想活了
Determined to die. Shit.

1033
01:19:54,043 --> 01:19:56,053
聽我命令
On my command!

1034
01:22:20,017 --> 01:22:21,081
這回可以一起撤了吧
I'm going down the hole now.

1035
01:22:28,058 --> 01:22:30,005
我們跟在你後面
After you.

1036
01:22:32,085 --> 01:22:34,059
布魯，布魯，你跑去哪了？
Blue. Blue. Where you been, mate?

1037
01:22:34,059 --> 01:22:36,032
我爸爸呢
Where's my dad?

1038
01:22:36,039 --> 01:22:37,096
我們走散了，但他能走回安全屋的
We got split up, but he knows his way.

1039
01:22:38,002 --> 01:22:39,033
- 我要去找到他 - 別急，布魯
- I've gotta find him. - Wait, Blue.

1040
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:40,073
你的父親認識路的
Your dad knows what he's doing.

1041
01:22:40,079 --> 01:22:41,086
說不定這會他已經到了呢，布魯
He'll be back before you know it, mate.

1042
01:22:41,093 --> 01:22:42,080
威特
Wet Stick.

1043
01:22:43,056 --> 01:22:46,033
布魯！快回來！
Blue! Blue! Blue!

1044
01:22:48,023 --> 01:22:51,000
兄弟們，給我搜遍整棟樓！
Come on, boys! Search them dwellings now!

1045
01:22:51,007 --> 01:22:52,094
挨家挨戶的搜！
Get through them doors!

1046
01:23:02,085 --> 01:23:04,085
現在想出城可不容易
It's not gonna be easy getting out of here now.

1047
01:23:04,092 --> 01:23:07,065
我們不能在這待太久，哪兒都不安全
You can't stay here long. Nowhere in the city is safe.

1048
01:23:07,072 --> 01:23:09,062
船已經準備好了
The boat's ready.

1049
01:23:09,069 --> 01:23:11,096
要等拜克·萊克和他的兒子布魯?，亞瑟？
What about Back Lack and Blue, Art?

1050
01:23:14,013 --> 01:23:15,093
我們等到天黑就走
We'll wait until dark.

1051
01:23:24,067 --> 01:23:26,044
你去哪了，爸爸？
Where you been, Dad?

1052
01:23:26,051 --> 01:23:27,078
我先喘口氣
Catching me breath.

1053
01:23:29,051 --> 01:23:30,064
你怎麼了？
What's wrong?

1054
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:32,085
我沒事，我很好
Nothing. I'm all right.

1055
01:23:32,091 --> 01:23:34,085
我們一起去安全屋
Just got to get to the safe house.

1056
01:23:36,058 --> 01:23:38,002
爸爸，你撐得住?？
Can you make it?

1057
01:23:40,012 --> 01:23:41,045
我愛你，兒子，我撐得住
I love you, mate.

1058
01:23:42,039 --> 01:23:44,002
走吧，咱們走
Come on, let's get going.

1059
01:23:52,087 --> 01:23:53,090
快跑！
Run!

1060
01:23:57,067 --> 01:23:59,074
伏提庚去死吧！
Vortigern!

1061
01:24:11,048 --> 01:24:14,052
看起來你已經能夠掌控聖劍的力量了
It seems as though you found a way to use the sword.

1062
01:24:14,059 --> 01:24:16,002
不是我控制它
I wasn't controlling it.

1063
01:24:18,046 --> 01:24:19,083
我來幫你吧
Here.

1064
01:24:20,063 --> 01:24:22,083
而是它控制我
It was controlling me.

1065
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:24,083
我甚至都不記得當時發生了什麼事
I can't even remember what happened.

1066
01:24:24,090 --> 01:24:26,017
我都看到了
I can.

1067
01:24:28,044 --> 01:24:29,077
謝謝你
Thank you.

1068
01:24:35,064 --> 01:24:38,005
好像外面發生了什麼事情
Something's happening, you know?

1069
01:24:39,065 --> 01:24:41,018
聽起來是這樣
Certainly sounds like it.

1070
01:24:41,025 --> 01:24:43,045
有些人已經見識到你的神力了
People have seen what you can do.

1071
01:24:43,052 --> 01:24:45,045
你已不再是一個神話
You're no longer a myth.

1072
01:24:45,052 --> 01:24:48,039
這昭示著合法繼承人是真實存在的，對於敢於反抗的人們來說，你開始有了意義
You're starting to mean something.

1073
01:24:48,045 --> 01:24:49,086
我本意並非如此
That wasn't the intention.

1074
01:24:49,092 --> 01:24:51,052
他們現在正打著你的旗號戰鬥
They are fighting in your name.

1075
01:24:52,079 --> 01:24:55,066
但我不想擔當什麼重任
I don't wanna wear that.

1076
01:24:59,010 --> 01:25:00,070
是布魯?？
Is that you, Blue?

1077
01:25:00,077 --> 01:25:02,005
對，老大！
Yes, boss!

1078
01:25:02,005 --> 01:25:03,034
你找到了你的父親?？
Did you find your father?

1079
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:04,081
我回來啦！
He's found him!

1080
01:25:16,092 --> 01:25:18,055
我們得帶你離開這兒
We need to get you out of here.

1081
01:25:18,062 --> 01:25:20,049
萊克，走，我們把你抬到船上
Let's get your arse on that boat, Lack.

1082
01:25:20,055 --> 01:25:22,076
河面霧氣瀰漫，能掩蓋我們的行蹤
There's a good fog to cover our tracks.

1083
01:25:22,082 --> 01:25:24,032
我們走
Come on.

1084
01:25:24,033 --> 01:25:25,083
讓我先歇會
I'll need a little breather.

1085
01:25:25,089 --> 01:25:28,053
快，把其他人都送上船再來接我
Here, load everyone else up and come back for me.

1086
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:30,038
不，我要和你在一起
No, I'll stay with you.

1087
01:25:30,038 --> 01:25:32,017
聽爸爸的話，去幫他們抬點東西
No, you won't. Give 'em a hand.

1088
01:25:35,044 --> 01:25:37,057
我沒事的，兒子
I'll be all right, mate.

1089
01:25:37,064 --> 01:25:39,024
我只是想休息一下
Just give me a minute.

1090
01:25:40,044 --> 01:25:41,064
走吧，布魯
Come on, Blue.

1091
01:25:42,058 --> 01:25:43,078
拿著這個
You carry this.

1092
01:25:45,038 --> 01:25:47,028
快，我們走
Come on. Come on.

1093
01:25:48,078 --> 01:25:50,085
布魯，我們走
Come on, Blue.

1094
01:26:05,053 --> 01:26:07,000
晚上好啊
Evenin'.

1095
01:26:17,061 --> 01:26:19,008
很抱歉沒跟你打招呼就闖進你的家
Pardon the intrusion.

1096
01:26:35,036 --> 01:26:38,013
我們的獵犬鼻子很靈，把我們引到這來了
Our dog was very keen to lead us here.

1097
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:39,023
我們走
Come on.

1098
01:26:39,030 --> 01:26:41,037
隊長，要不要現在抓住他？
Shall I pick him up, Sarge?

1099
01:26:41,043 --> 01:26:43,030
不，我們跟著他，他會帶我們找到他的同黨
No, follow him.

1100
01:26:43,037 --> 01:26:45,017
我手下循著血跡一路跟蹤過來
The blood he followed was from a man

1101
01:26:45,024 --> 01:26:47,017
今天早些時候，受傷的這個人試圖刺殺我，結果失手
who killed one of my sergeants today.

1102
01:26:47,024 --> 01:26:52,045
在從犯罪現場逃離的過程中
A man who fled the scene of an assassination attempt

1103
01:26:52,051 --> 01:26:53,091
殺害了一位黑甲兵隊長
on me.

1104
01:26:56,038 --> 01:26:58,009
我說的沒錯吧？
On me, no less.

1105
01:27:01,026 --> 01:27:03,066
你應該不知道他在哪吧？
You wouldn't happen to know where that man is, would you?

1106
01:27:06,046 --> 01:27:08,016
我要回去接我爸爸
I can't.

1107
01:27:08,023 --> 01:27:10,010
聽話，布魯，你上船坐著，我去接你爸爸過來
Get in the boat, Blue. I'll get your dad.

1108
01:27:10,023 --> 01:27:12,010
我不能拋下他
I can't leave him!

1109
01:27:12,017 --> 01:27:14,067
看看你們這架勢
Have a look at this situation, would ya?

1110
01:27:14,073 --> 01:27:17,010
我們尊貴的英格蘭的國王
The king of all England himself

1111
01:27:17,017 --> 01:27:20,021
竟然會屈尊光臨寒舍
has made the effort to visit a commoner.

1112
01:27:21,061 --> 01:27:23,068
居然會拜訪我這麼一個無名小卒
A man from nowhere.

1113
01:27:24,074 --> 01:27:27,015
我氣數已盡
And today, my last day.

1114
01:27:29,078 --> 01:27:31,042
你看起來神采奕奕
You look well

1115
01:27:31,048 --> 01:27:33,062
而我卻遍體鱗傷
and I feel poor.

1116
01:27:34,056 --> 01:27:36,036
但我絕不後悔，你的好日子就要到頭了！
But who would I rather be?

1117
01:27:40,079 --> 01:27:42,000
小子，你是乾什麼的？
What do you want, kid?

1118
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:44,060
這個男孩是誰？
Who's this young man?

1119
01:27:44,066 --> 01:27:46,050
大人，我是這的清潔工
I'm the cleaner, sir.

1120
01:27:46,057 --> 01:27:47,087
他是你的什麼人？
Who's he to you?

1121
01:27:47,093 --> 01:27:49,087
我不認識他
Never seen him before.

1122
01:27:49,094 --> 01:27:51,084
是這樣的，我通常晚點過來
I usually come in later, you know,

1123
01:27:51,090 --> 01:27:54,031
等他們都走了，我就把盤子給刷了
do the dishes when they're all gone.

1124
01:27:54,037 --> 01:27:55,074
你說的是實話?？
Is that the truth?

1125
01:27:55,081 --> 01:27:57,078
是，大人，我從不對黑甲兵撒謊的
Yes, sir. I'd never lie to a Blackleg.

1126
01:27:58,091 --> 01:28:00,085
真是個好孩子
Good boy.

1127
01:28:03,085 --> 01:28:05,059
你確實不認識他，對吧？
So you don't know him?

1128
01:28:05,065 --> 01:28:07,002
是的，大人
No, sir.

1129
01:28:09,019 --> 01:28:11,003
那如果我要把他的耳朵割下來，你應該不會介意吧
Then you wouldn't mind if I cut his ears off?

1130
01:28:11,009 --> 01:28:13,029
又不是我的耳朵，隨便你啊
They're not my ears. Do what you want with them.

1131
01:28:27,014 --> 01:28:28,014
住手！
No!

1132
01:28:30,094 --> 01:28:33,048
我一直想要個兒子
Always wanted a boy.

1133
01:28:34,068 --> 01:28:36,022
你個混蛋！
You bastard!

1134
01:28:36,028 --> 01:28:38,005
放開他！
Leave him alone!

1135
01:28:39,022 --> 01:28:41,055
現在我再問你一遍
Now I repeat,

1136
01:28:41,062 --> 01:28:43,019
你的同黨在哪裡
where's your friend?

1137
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:47,046
放開他
Let him go.

1138
01:28:50,030 --> 01:28:51,030
放開他
Let him go.

1139
01:28:55,023 --> 01:28:57,030
把他帶走！
Take the boy and...

1140
01:28:58,024 --> 01:28:59,057
不！
No!

1141
01:28:59,067 --> 01:29:01,084
不！
No!

1142
01:29:20,003 --> 01:29:23,006
反叛分子格殺勿論！
Crush the Resistance tonight!

1143
01:29:36,038 --> 01:29:37,038
弓箭手準備！
Archers!

1144
01:32:08,093 --> 01:32:12,033
讓我告訴你
Let me show you

1145
01:32:14,060 --> 01:32:18,007
如果你不接受這柄劍
what your uncle will do

1146
01:32:18,014 --> 01:32:21,094
你的叔叔伏提庚
if you do not accept

1147
01:32:23,084 --> 01:32:26,068
就會將城市化為廢墟，生靈塗炭
this sword.

1148
01:32:29,095 --> 01:32:33,039
只有你才能阻止他
Only you can prevent this.

1149
01:32:36,012 --> 01:32:38,056
你要拿著聖劍
He must be met

1150
01:32:38,062 --> 01:32:42,050
去那座高塔，跟他決一死戰
where sword meets tower.

1151
01:32:44,093 --> 01:32:47,033
仰仗女巫對你的幫助
Trust the Mage.

1152
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:52,001
拿起王者之劍
Take it.

1153
01:33:36,075 --> 01:33:39,032
聽說你想告訴我一些事
Apparently you have something to tell me.

1154
01:33:54,020 --> 01:33:55,060
我還以為你會問我發生了什麼事呢
I suppose you wanna know what happened to me.

1155
01:33:55,067 --> 01:34:00,004
有些事要跟你說說，先說好，我們不會逼你
I don't wanna push you, but... George?

1156
01:34:00,011 --> 01:34:01,081
叛亂活動四處蔓延
Riots are spreading.

1157
01:34:01,088 --> 01:34:04,048
不僅僅是在倫底紐姆，全英格蘭的人們都開始反抗伏提庚的統治了
Not just in Londinium. Across the whole country.

1158
01:34:04,054 --> 01:34:06,005
人們在以你的名義而戰
People are fighting for you.

1159
01:34:06,011 --> 01:34:08,022
是時候行動起來了，沒有比現在更好的機會了
If there was ever a chance, it's now.

1160
01:34:08,028 --> 01:34:09,058
機會稍縱即逝，我們要把握好
It's not going to last.

1161
01:34:09,065 --> 01:34:13,049
但是，他剛剛也說了，我們不會逼你
But, like he said, we're not going to push you.

1162
01:34:13,055 --> 01:34:15,009
我已經準備好了
I'm ready.

1163
01:34:16,022 --> 01:34:18,023
我們要去進攻他的大本營城堡
We're gonna take the castle.

1164
01:34:19,049 --> 01:34:21,033
而且，我們要從正門攻進去
And we're going in the front door.

1165
01:34:23,006 --> 01:34:26,063
喬治，我要你去一趟倫底紐姆，召集人手
George, I need you to go to Londinium, gather the lads.

1166
01:34:28,064 --> 01:34:29,070
女巫在哪？
Where's the Mage?

1167
01:34:30,064 --> 01:34:32,010
她回山洞去了
She's back at the cave.

1168
01:34:32,017 --> 01:34:33,097
好吧
All right.

1169
01:34:34,004 --> 01:34:36,064
剛纔你說我們要去進攻他的大本營
Now, when you say we're going to take the castle,

1170
01:34:37,031 --> 01:34:38,071
你具體想乾什麼
what does that mean?

1171
01:34:40,031 --> 01:34:42,035
你之前不是說你不會逼我的?，那就別多問
I thought you said you weren't gonna push me.

1172
01:34:44,028 --> 01:34:46,052
伙計們，傻站在那乾啥，我們走啊
Come on, lads. Chop, chop.

1173
01:35:03,090 --> 01:35:05,011
布魯！
Blue!

1174
01:35:07,021 --> 01:35:08,041
布魯！你在哪！
Blue!

1175
01:35:10,041 --> 01:35:11,041
布魯！
Blue!

1176
01:35:11,041 --> 01:35:12,061
你們好啊
Hello!

1177
01:35:15,002 --> 01:35:17,078
你們回來的可真慢啊
You took your time getting here.

1178
01:35:22,076 --> 01:35:25,069
我說幾句話就走，我老婆還在家等我回去做飯呢
I'm not gonna hear the end of this from my wife.

1179
01:35:25,076 --> 01:35:28,049
我可不想再聽她嘮叨我半天了
It was my turn to cook tonight.

1180
01:35:28,056 --> 01:35:34,013
陛下派我來給你們帶個口信
I've been sent by His Majesty to deliver a message.

1181
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:38,017
讓我想想..
Let's think...

1182
01:35:40,051 --> 01:35:43,058
天黑之前趕到城堡
"Be at the castle before dark

1183
01:35:43,064 --> 01:35:48,065
要不然那女孩和那孩子
"if you wanna see the girl and the boy

1184
01:35:48,071 --> 01:35:50,068
就沒命嘍
"alive".

1185
01:35:50,075 --> 01:35:52,082
我也想坐下來跟你們喝喝酒聊聊天
I would love to stay and chat,

1186
01:35:52,089 --> 01:35:55,092
但我不得不先走一步啦，你們也知道
but you do understand the situation

1187
01:35:55,099 --> 01:35:57,066
我老婆特別愛嘮叨
between me and my wife.

1188
01:36:03,096 --> 01:36:07,073
你們若是敢動我一根汗毛
Anything that you do to me

1189
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:13,087
我們都會十倍奉還
will be repaid 10 times in kind.

1190
01:36:16,068 --> 01:36:18,058
你也算是貴族出身
Now, you're a big man.

1191
01:36:19,095 --> 01:36:21,075
讓我看看下一步你們要怎麼辦
Now, let's see you move.

1192
01:36:32,073 --> 01:36:34,019
晚上見
Evening.

1193
01:37:09,006 --> 01:37:10,023
亞瑟在哪？
So, where is he?

1194
01:37:10,030 --> 01:37:13,027
他在離這有一天的旅程的地方
He's a day's ride from here.

1195
01:37:13,033 --> 01:37:15,020
確定了她安全以後，他才會過來
As soon as she's safe, he will come.

1196
01:37:15,027 --> 01:37:18,054
先給你聖劍，沒有劍，他就不能對你造成威脅
He poses no threat to you without the sword.

1197
01:37:19,034 --> 01:37:21,014
告訴他，明天必須趕到
Tomorrow.

1198
01:37:21,021 --> 01:37:24,001
相信你也知道
I don't have to remind you of what will happen

1199
01:37:24,008 --> 01:37:25,068
要是他不來的話
if he doesn't come.

1200
01:37:26,071 --> 01:37:29,048
那個小男孩會有怎樣的下場
I'll start with the little boy.

1201
01:37:29,055 --> 01:37:31,065
帶上這個女人，走吧
Now, take the girl and go.

1202
01:37:39,076 --> 01:37:43,030
這種蛇毒能讓你看見隱藏的東西
This venom will induce that which is hidden from you.

1203
01:37:43,036 --> 01:37:47,013
能讓你看見一些你不想看見的東西
It will show you things you do not want to see.

1204
01:37:47,020 --> 01:37:49,087
但這對你來說很有用
But you'll need its protection.

1205
01:37:49,094 --> 01:37:51,077
握住我的手
Hold my hand.

1206
01:37:59,091 --> 01:38:01,011
我討厭蛇
I don't like snakes.

1207
01:38:01,018 --> 01:38:03,032
大家都討厭蛇
No one likes snakes.

1208
01:38:11,019 --> 01:38:12,079
握住我的手
Stay with me.

1209
01:38:16,023 --> 01:38:17,046
握住我的手
Stay with me.

1210
01:38:23,027 --> 01:38:26,094
藥效會持續幾個小時
You will feel it for a few hours.

1211
01:38:27,001 --> 01:38:32,085
歌詞大意：年輕的獵人狩獵歸來，虛弱而又貧乏無力
Young man came from hunting faint and weary

1212
01:38:35,041 --> 01:38:40,099
我最親愛的你，是何物在折磨著我的上帝？
What does ail My Lord, my dearie?

1213
01:38:46,093 --> 01:38:52,063
我親愛的兄弟，請鋪好我的床
O brother dear, let my bed be made

1214
01:38:55,000 --> 01:39:00,084
龍葵帶來的絞痛使我不安
For I feel the gripe of the woody nightshade

1215
01:39:05,014 --> 01:39:11,014
這個獵人的生命即將逝去
This young man, he died fair soon

1216
01:39:11,068 --> 01:39:16,052
在獵人的宏月輝茫之下
By the light of the hunters' moon

1217
01:39:16,059 --> 01:39:20,069
弩箭不會上膛
'Twas not by bolt Nor yet by blade

1218
01:39:22,056 --> 01:39:27,067
但我將舉起那用木龍葵漿果塗抹的劍
Oh, the berries of the woody nightshade

1219
01:39:27,073 --> 01:39:32,071
親愛的父親寧和地躺在這裡
?Oh, father dear, lie heavy safe

1220
01:39:34,064 --> 01:39:37,081
在這惡魔鋪就的路上
From the power that the devil made

1221
01:39:43,082 --> 01:39:47,002
路上...
Made

1222
01:40:03,084 --> 01:40:05,011
站住
That's far enough.

1223
01:40:07,077 --> 01:40:10,038
讓我們了結這一切吧
Let's get this done quickly, shall we?

1224
01:40:10,044 --> 01:40:11,081
讓他跪下
Put him on his knees.

1225
01:40:13,038 --> 01:40:15,008
讓他跪下！
Put him on his knees!

1226
01:41:47,034 --> 01:41:48,054
拿起武器，跟他們拼了！
Go, go, go!

1227
01:42:09,029 --> 01:42:12,023
你知道你要付出怎樣的代價的
You know the price.

1228
01:42:24,038 --> 01:42:25,078
爸爸，發生什麼事了
Father, what's happening?

1229
01:42:26,035 --> 01:42:27,065
你們兩個出去
Leave.

1230
01:42:35,062 --> 01:42:37,012
你臉上的血是怎麼回事
Why is there blood on your face?

1231
01:42:40,046 --> 01:42:42,010
發生什麼事了
What's going on?

1232
01:42:50,007 --> 01:42:52,001
爸爸，你這樣把我嚇壞了
Father, you're scaring me.

1233
01:42:57,091 --> 01:42:59,095
我真的很愛你
I love you very much.

1234
01:43:37,022 --> 01:43:38,089
沖啊！
Come on!

1235
01:43:43,049 --> 01:43:44,069
沖啊！
Charge!

1236
01:47:20,021 --> 01:47:24,034
侄子，你贏了
You have won, nephew.

1237
01:47:34,032 --> 01:47:37,056
看上去你確實贏了
You have won.

1238
01:47:44,043 --> 01:47:47,043
但你還沒有擊敗我
Now, play with me.

1239
01:48:48,043 --> 01:48:52,090
看來，這把劍要屬於我了
I think that sword belongs to me now.

1240
01:48:59,057 --> 01:49:01,001
快跑，兒子！
Run, son!

1241
01:49:12,082 --> 01:49:14,055
弟弟
Brother...

1242
01:49:15,092 --> 01:49:19,029
看來，這把劍要屬於我了
I think that sword belongs to me now.

1243
01:49:19,036 --> 01:49:21,043
你所付出的代價
Whatever price you paid,

1244
01:49:21,049 --> 01:49:24,006
遠超你所得到的一切
it will be more than you know.

1245
01:49:29,084 --> 01:49:32,027
兒子，你不需要再逃跑了
You don't need to run anymore.

1246
01:49:36,018 --> 01:49:38,071
你不需要再逃避自己的過去了
You don't need to look away.

1247
01:49:50,059 --> 01:49:52,063
聖劍歸你了
The sword is yours, son.

1248
01:49:54,073 --> 01:49:55,076
拿起它
Take it.

1249
01:50:28,059 --> 01:50:31,073
你之前問我，是什麼撐起了我的野心
You wanted to know what gave me such drive.

1250
01:50:36,073 --> 01:50:38,017
我現在可以告訴你，是你撐起了我的野心
It was you.

1251
01:50:44,011 --> 01:50:46,005
是你害得我成為孤兒，在妓院里長大
You put me in that brothel.

1252
01:50:54,005 --> 01:50:56,012
是你害得我我流落街頭
You cut me on the streets.

1253
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:07,047
我之所以會有今天，都是因為你
I am here now because of you.

1254
01:52:04,062 --> 01:52:06,056
你
You

1255
01:52:06,063 --> 01:52:08,026
造就了我
created me.

1256
01:52:33,002 --> 01:52:34,005
為此
And, for that...

1257
01:52:34,012 --> 01:52:35,082
我向你致敬
I bless you.

1258
01:52:39,076 --> 01:52:42,039
你讓我的奮鬥有了意義
You make sense of the devil.

1259
01:54:10,072 --> 01:54:11,072
拉弓！
Nock!

1260
01:54:14,099 --> 01:54:16,022
點火！
Light!

1261
01:54:20,023 --> 01:54:21,059
準備！
Ready!

1262
01:54:25,073 --> 01:54:26,073
放箭！
Loose!

1263
01:54:49,022 --> 01:54:51,036
我知道
While I understand there's been a change

1264
01:54:51,042 --> 01:54:54,009
雖然貴國的國君有所更替
in the leadership of this nation...

1265
01:54:54,016 --> 01:54:56,066
但我相信您仍然會遵守
I am confident that you will still honor the agreement

1266
01:54:56,073 --> 01:55:01,010
前任國君同我國國君達成的協議
made by your predecessor and my king.

1267
01:55:01,017 --> 01:55:02,050
根據協議
We expect to leave here

1268
01:55:02,057 --> 01:55:05,037
我們要運走一萬名年輕男子
with 10,000 young men
as agreed.

1269
01:55:05,044 --> 01:55:07,027
伙計，這事我不同意
Yeah, I don't think so, mate.

1270
01:55:08,014 --> 01:55:09,034
您說什麼？
Excuse me?

1271
01:55:11,074 --> 01:55:13,055
我剛剛說，這事我不同意
I said, "I don't think so, mate".

1272
01:55:16,061 --> 01:55:19,035
我們在這乾啥來著？
We've been wondering what you were doing in here.

1273
01:55:20,015 --> 01:55:21,065
這玩意看上去很有趣
I like it.

1274
01:55:23,026 --> 01:55:24,046
這是啥？
What is it?

1275
01:55:25,019 --> 01:55:26,032
對啊，我也問，這是什麼？
Yes, what is it?

1276
01:55:26,039 --> 01:55:28,076
這是一塊放圓形奶酪的大轉盤？
A carousel? A giant wheel of cheese?

1277
01:55:28,083 --> 01:55:30,043
你準備拿這玩意乾啥？
What are you supposed to do with it?

1278
01:55:30,050 --> 01:55:32,003
我懂了
I know.

1279
01:55:32,010 --> 01:55:33,047
這是個舞池
It's a dance floor.

1280
01:55:33,053 --> 01:55:35,060
等把它修好了
And once you finish it

1281
01:55:35,067 --> 01:55:37,037
我們要怎麼把它運到舞廳中間
how are you supposed to get to the middle?

1282
01:55:37,044 --> 01:55:38,090
我們要怎麼把它搬過去
But how did you get it through the door?

1283
01:55:38,097 --> 01:55:41,041
是抬著走還是滾著走？
Did you carry it in? Or did you roll it in?

1284
01:55:41,047 --> 01:55:42,087
我想提醒一下陛下
May I remind you

1285
01:55:42,094 --> 01:55:46,041
我們有三千艘作戰船隻
a fleet of 3,000 longships controlling the seas,

1286
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:47,085
掌控著貴國周邊海域的制海權
surrounding your island.

1287
01:55:47,091 --> 01:55:51,082
我建議您不要得罪我們
It would be unwise to displease my king.

1288
01:55:52,032 --> 01:55:53,052
那真是不好意思了
I'm sorry.

1289
01:55:56,082 --> 01:56:00,039
喬治，威特，珀西，請行跪拜禮
George, Wet Stick, Percy, on your knees.

1290
01:56:01,039 --> 01:56:02,086
貝德維爾爵士，有勞你主持儀式了
Sir Bedivere, if you would?

1291
01:56:05,026 --> 01:56:08,033
我可以給貴國寬限一周的時間
I'm prepared to extend the deadline by a week.

1292
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:09,060
我說了不行，就是不行
No.

1293
01:56:10,030 --> 01:56:12,000
我再說一遍
I mean, I'm sorry.

1294
01:56:12,007 --> 01:56:13,067
別搞錯了，現在時局變了
You've made a mistake.

1295
01:56:13,074 --> 01:56:15,054
我和伏提庚很不一樣
You're no longer dealing with the man

1296
01:56:15,061 --> 01:56:17,061
他受到人民的唾棄
you previously met.

1297
01:56:18,041 --> 01:56:22,085
而我，受人民擁戴
You are addressing England

1298
01:56:22,091 --> 01:56:27,009
我代表的是全英格蘭的人民
and all the subjects under her king's protection.

1299
01:56:27,015 --> 01:56:29,039
起身，喬治爵士
Arise, Sir George.

1300
01:56:29,045 --> 01:56:31,019
現在你最好
So you have a choice.

1301
01:56:31,026 --> 01:56:34,013
向全英格蘭人民行跪拜禮
You can now kneel to England...

1302
01:56:35,033 --> 01:56:37,060
起身，特裡斯坦爵士
Arise, Sir Tristan.

1303
01:56:37,066 --> 01:56:40,010
要不然我就不客氣了
Or I'll step off this throne,

1304
01:56:40,016 --> 01:56:43,080
你可以試試看，要是你再用跟伏提庚打交道的方式，和我打交道
and you can deal with me as the man you previously met.

1305
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:46,087
起身，珀西瓦爾爵士
Arise, Sir Percival.

1306
01:56:50,068 --> 01:56:52,095
會有怎樣的後果
And we can see how that goes.

1307
01:56:58,098 --> 01:57:00,039
威廉爵士
Sir William.

1308
01:57:01,059 --> 01:57:03,039
你來主持我的儀式吧
If you would?

1309
01:57:05,006 --> 01:57:06,049
榮幸之至
It would be my honor.

1310
01:57:29,085 --> 01:57:32,022
這不挺好的?，起身
Well, now that's out the way,

1311
01:57:32,028 --> 01:57:33,069
大家坐下來吃飯
let's eat.

1312
01:57:37,056 --> 01:57:38,082
既然能當朋友
Why have enemies

1313
01:57:39,076 --> 01:57:41,066
又何必樹敵呢
when you can have friends?

1314
01:57:46,056 --> 01:57:49,003
起身，陛下
Arise, my king.

1315
01:58:01,021 --> 01:58:02,058
亞瑟王
King Arthur.

1316
01:58:09,079 --> 01:58:11,066
這不是舞池，這是張圓桌
It's a table.

1317
01:58:12,042 --> 01:58:14,013
我們可以圍坐在圓桌邊，討論事情
You sit at it.

1318
01:58:37,035 --> 01:58:39,028
天佑吾王！
Long live the King!

1319
01:58:39,045 --> 01:58:41,052
吾王萬歲！
Long live the King!
