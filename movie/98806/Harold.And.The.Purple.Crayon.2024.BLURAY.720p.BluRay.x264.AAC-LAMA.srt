00:01:12,029 --> 00:01:14,198
<i>Once there was a boy
named Harold,</i>

4
00:01:14,198 --> 00:01:16,742
<i>who went on an adventure.</i>

5
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:19,662
<i>And he took
his purple crayon with him.</i>

6
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,038
Aha!

7
00:01:21,038 --> 00:01:23,791
<i>He could draw
whatever he wanted.</i>

8
00:01:25,876 --> 00:01:28,837
<i>And sometimes,
that got him in over his head.</i>

9
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,925
<i>But he always came up
thinking fast.</i>

10
00:01:35,177 --> 00:01:37,221
<i>And it was on
to the next adventure.</i>

11
00:01:39,139 --> 00:01:41,641
<i>He did what anyone
would do with a magic crayon.</i>

12
00:01:41,641 --> 00:01:45,353
<i>He made some pies,
and then he made some friends.</i>

13
00:01:45,353 --> 00:01:47,605
<i>He called them
Moose and Porcupine.</i>

14
00:01:47,605 --> 00:01:48,898
Come on, everybody.

15
00:01:48,898 --> 00:01:50,942
<i>For obvious reasons.</i>

16
00:01:52,652 --> 00:01:55,363
Not again!

17
00:01:57,198 --> 00:01:59,325
<i>They never left
each other's sides.</i>

18
00:01:59,325 --> 00:02:02,620
<i>Even when they got lost,
they always found each other.</i>

19
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,080
<i>No matter where they were,</i>

20
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,209
<i>Harold always remembered
where his bedroom window was.</i>

21
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:10,002
<i>Right around the moon.</i>

22
00:02:13,673 --> 00:02:14,757
<i>Night, Harold.</i>

23
00:02:14,757 --> 00:02:16,134
Good night.

24
00:02:19,804 --> 00:02:20,847
<i>The end.</i>

25
00:02:20,847 --> 00:02:22,265
<i>Good night, folks.</i>

26
00:02:22,265 --> 00:02:25,310
<i>Just kidding! Of course
the story didn't end there.</i>

27
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:28,521
Come on, everybody!

28
00:02:29,772 --> 00:02:31,316
I need to go down now!

29
00:02:32,025 --> 00:02:33,484
<i>His world got bigger.</i>

30
00:02:33,943 --> 00:02:36,612
<i>And so did his imagination.</i>

31
00:02:37,195 --> 00:02:39,197
You got that right, Narrator!

32
00:02:39,197 --> 00:02:41,408
My stomachs are sloshing around!

33
00:02:41,408 --> 00:02:43,744
- Harold, look out!
- What?

34
00:02:44,828 --> 00:02:45,996
Hey, everybody!

35
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:52,461
<i>And he still got in
over his head.</i>

36
00:02:54,463 --> 00:02:56,882
<i>But he always came up
thinking fast.</i>

37
00:02:56,882 --> 00:02:58,342
Little help here!

38
00:02:59,635 --> 00:03:01,219
<i>Faster than that.</i>

39
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:04,222
<i>- Harold!</i>
- I got it!

40
00:03:04,806 --> 00:03:06,308
Oh, hi!

41
00:03:06,308 --> 00:03:08,143
<i>With his purple crayon,</i>

42
00:03:08,143 --> 00:03:09,353
<i>anything was possible.</i>

43
00:03:09,353 --> 00:03:10,729
Gotcha!

44
00:03:11,813 --> 00:03:14,650
-<i>Oh, careful there.</i>
-Sorry, Moose.

45
00:03:17,486 --> 00:03:19,321
Hmmph.

46
00:03:19,321 --> 00:03:20,572
I've been thinking.

47
00:03:21,156 --> 00:03:23,659
If I drew you guys,
then who drew me?

48
00:03:24,743 --> 00:03:25,827
That's deep.

49
00:03:25,827 --> 00:03:27,371
<i>I drew you, Harold.</i>

50
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:30,165
- You did?
-<i>Mm-hmm. I sure did.</i>

51
00:03:30,165 --> 00:03:31,583
What do you look like?

52
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,417
<i>I used to look
a little like you.</i>

53
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:34,877
<i>But I'm an old man now.</i>

54
00:03:34,877 --> 00:03:37,129
<i>I guess in a way
I'm your old man.</i>

55
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:38,714
My old man.

56
00:03:40,216 --> 00:03:43,094
So then why can't I
see you, Old Man?

57
00:03:43,094 --> 00:03:45,012
<i>Because
I'm someplace else.</i>

58
00:03:45,012 --> 00:03:46,555
<i>The Real World.</i>

59
00:03:46,555 --> 00:03:49,725
The Real World. Wow.

60
00:03:49,725 --> 00:03:50,810
What's that?

61
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,520
<i>Well,
it's kind of like your world</i>

62
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,813
<i>only a bit more colorful.</i>

63
00:03:53,813 --> 00:03:55,439
<i>And a lot more complicated.</i>

64
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,150
Well, it sounds amazing.
Can I visit you someday?

65
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,069
<i>Oh,
I wish that was possible.</i>

66
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:02,780
But with the crayon
anything is possible, right?

67
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,282
<i>Good night, Harold.</i>

68
00:04:04,282 --> 00:04:06,575
Wait, wait, wait, Old Man.
One more question.

69
00:04:06,575 --> 00:04:08,786
- Why did you draw me?
-<i>Night, Harold.</i>

70
00:04:08,786 --> 00:04:10,663
Okay, okay.

71
00:04:10,663 --> 00:04:12,039
Good night, Old Man.

72
00:04:22,508 --> 00:04:24,468
So, Old Man, I've been thinking

73
00:04:24,468 --> 00:04:27,305
and I've got
a lot of follow-up questions.

74
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:29,889
Old Man?

75
00:04:30,473 --> 00:04:32,142
You there?

76
00:04:32,142 --> 00:04:35,103
Old Man. Hello!

77
00:04:35,103 --> 00:04:37,147
Old Man!

78
00:04:40,275 --> 00:04:43,278
Old Man!

79
00:04:44,404 --> 00:04:46,656
All of a sudden
this guy goes quiet?

80
00:04:46,656 --> 00:04:47,782
I don't think so.

81
00:04:47,782 --> 00:04:49,492
This man loved to talk.

82
00:04:49,492 --> 00:04:52,245
Maybe he's busy
being real in the Real World.

83
00:04:52,245 --> 00:04:54,039
I'm deep.

84
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:57,042
That's it! Guys,
let's go to the Real World!

85
00:04:57,042 --> 00:04:59,753
Oh, no, no, no.
We don't wanna do that.

86
00:05:02,213 --> 00:05:04,925
With the crayon,
anything is possible.

87
00:05:04,925 --> 00:05:07,385
That's not how it works, Harold.
You can't just--

88
00:05:12,015 --> 00:05:13,266
Whoa!

89
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:14,809
Yeah! Let's go!

90
00:05:16,186 --> 00:05:19,105
You heard the old man.
The Real World is constipated.

91
00:05:19,105 --> 00:05:20,899
And who knows what that means.

92
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:23,944
Okay, fine. You two stay here
in case my old man comes back.

93
00:05:23,944 --> 00:05:25,028
Great idea.

94
00:05:25,028 --> 00:05:27,613
And I'm gonna go look for him
out there. Don't worry.

95
00:05:27,613 --> 00:05:29,156
- I got this!
- Wait!

96
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,210
What is he wearing?

97
00:05:42,836 --> 00:05:44,088
It's so bright.

98
00:05:44,964 --> 00:05:46,340
It's so beautiful.

99
00:05:47,424 --> 00:05:49,176
What are you doing?

100
00:05:49,176 --> 00:05:51,720
It's very confusing.
I'm new here, but--

101
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,055
Oh, hello.

102
00:05:53,055 --> 00:05:54,515
Very creative.

103
00:05:56,976 --> 00:05:57,977
Near.

104
00:05:58,727 --> 00:05:59,770
Far.

105
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,939
Near. Far. Three dimensions.

106
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:04,149
Oh, it's even cooler
than I imagined!

107
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:05,985
Look at all the friendly people!

108
00:06:05,985 --> 00:06:08,946
- Oh, excuse me. Where are we?
- Get lost, Smurf.

109
00:06:08,946 --> 00:06:11,865
- We're going after him, right?
- Mmh-mmh. Nope.

110
00:06:11,865 --> 00:06:15,661
Aw, come on. Just a peek.

111
00:06:15,661 --> 00:06:17,538
- All right, all right.
- Yes!

112
00:06:17,538 --> 00:06:18,706
Just a peek.

113
00:06:21,874 --> 00:06:23,167
What's it look like?

114
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:27,505
I can't tell. It's...
It's all mysterious and fuzzy.

115
00:06:27,505 --> 00:06:31,217
Maybe you should look closer.

116
00:06:34,596 --> 00:06:36,389
Aw, come on!

117
00:06:43,855 --> 00:06:45,481
The Real World.

118
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:49,152
Why do my hooves feel so soft?

119
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:04,542
Hi!

120
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,211
What are we running from?

121
00:07:07,211 --> 00:07:08,755
A grown man in a onesie.

122
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,760
Oh.

123
00:07:15,345 --> 00:07:16,679
Real World clothes.

124
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:23,977
Different.

125
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,395
Leavin' me behind.

126
00:07:25,395 --> 00:07:28,148
You're not gonna last one day.

127
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:29,483
Don't worry.

128
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:31,777
Porcupine's on the way.

129
00:07:31,777 --> 00:07:32,945
Yes!

130
00:07:34,237 --> 00:07:35,614
No thumbs!

131
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,241
That's not good.

132
00:07:42,955 --> 00:07:44,248
It's him! Old Man!

133
00:07:44,248 --> 00:07:46,667
Old Man! Old Man!

134
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:47,918
Harold?

135
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:50,963
Harold! Harold! It's me, Moose!

136
00:07:50,963 --> 00:07:52,381
- Moose?
- Yes, yes.

137
00:07:52,381 --> 00:07:54,591
Oh, hi.

138
00:07:54,591 --> 00:07:56,885
Hi, buddy!
You look so different.

139
00:07:56,885 --> 00:07:59,596
- I look strange, right?
- No, no, you look really cool.

140
00:07:59,596 --> 00:08:01,223
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yeah.

141
00:08:01,223 --> 00:08:03,225
Okay, this Real World thing
is real.

142
00:08:03,225 --> 00:08:04,851
It's really real.
And guess what.

143
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,229
It's only getting better,
because we found him.

144
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:09,231
The old man. He's right here.

145
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:10,816
Let's go!

146
00:08:10,816 --> 00:08:13,443
Old Man! It's Harold! Finally!
Ow!

147
00:08:13,443 --> 00:08:14,944
Hey! Get away from me!

148
00:08:14,944 --> 00:08:16,612
Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

149
00:08:16,612 --> 00:08:18,030
Why would you do that?

150
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,283
Uh, Harold, maybe we
got the wrong guy.

151
00:08:20,283 --> 00:08:21,659
You're probably right,
Moose.

152
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:24,579
Have a good day, Not Old Man!

153
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,372
The Real World is huge.

154
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:28,708
There has to be at least
10 to 20 old men here.

155
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,585
Yeah. We got a lot
of ground to cover.

156
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:53,065
Real world, here I come!

157
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:18,089
Thumbs!

158
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:20,508
Yes! Yes.

159
00:09:21,885 --> 00:09:24,429
Whoa.
Look at these legs!

160
00:09:25,931 --> 00:09:26,765
Whoa.

161
00:09:27,474 --> 00:09:29,142
Ah. Aah.

162
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:36,232
Look out, world.

163
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:37,901
I'm big.

164
00:09:39,861 --> 00:09:41,571
Hi. I'm Porcupine.

165
00:09:41,571 --> 00:09:42,906
I'm a bunny.

166
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,616
No way.

167
00:09:46,701 --> 00:09:47,827
Hi!

168
00:09:51,248 --> 00:09:54,084
-Get off the road!
- Nice day for a ride!

169
00:09:54,668 --> 00:09:55,669
<i>Hey, Prasad.</i>

170
00:09:56,544 --> 00:09:58,630
I know,
I won't miss another sh--

171
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,924
I won't miss another shift.
I just--

172
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,260
Come on, Prasad.

173
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,929
I had to take my kid
to a school thing.

174
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:09,139
She should not be
using her phone while driving.

175
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:12,935
- Uh, Harold?
- Yeah?

176
00:10:13,102 --> 00:10:14,645
I don't think
we're doing this right!

177
00:10:14,645 --> 00:10:16,647
- Okay.
- Look out!

178
00:10:16,647 --> 00:10:18,857
Excuse us! Excuse us!

179
00:10:19,566 --> 00:10:21,568
-Prasad. Hold on.
- Mom!

180
00:10:28,617 --> 00:10:30,077
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

181
00:10:33,789 --> 00:10:34,707
Oh...

182
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,877
You okay, Carl?
It's okay, buddy.

183
00:10:38,877 --> 00:10:41,046
Felt like my old self
for a second.

184
00:10:41,046 --> 00:10:42,923
I don't know
if it was a fear thing.

185
00:10:42,923 --> 00:10:45,050
Oh, my God! Are you okay?
I'm so sorry!

186
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,510
I didn't see you there.

187
00:10:47,177 --> 00:10:50,097
I thought I saw a moose.
Did you guys see a moose?

188
00:10:50,097 --> 00:10:51,223
Yeah. I'm a moose.

189
00:10:51,223 --> 00:10:53,058
I think you have a concussion.

190
00:10:53,058 --> 00:10:55,144
My insides are coming out
my outsides!

191
00:10:55,144 --> 00:10:56,478
I'm gonna
get you a Band-Aid.

192
00:10:56,478 --> 00:10:57,855
I think I have one in my purse.

193
00:10:59,565 --> 00:11:01,483
Oh... Oh, shoot.

194
00:11:01,483 --> 00:11:04,485
I got a flat tire. Sorry,
one sec. Just hang on. Um...

195
00:11:04,485 --> 00:11:06,154
Hang on one sec.

196
00:11:07,614 --> 00:11:09,532
Hi. Yeah, I'm gonna need a tire.

197
00:11:09,532 --> 00:11:11,743
I have a flat and no spare.

198
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:13,953
Yeah, I'll hold. Thank you.

199
00:11:22,545 --> 00:11:24,422
- How did you do that?
- Shh!

200
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:25,506
Hi, I'm--

201
00:11:29,552 --> 00:11:31,346
Wow, you are really
good at that.

202
00:11:31,346 --> 00:11:33,514
She's not actually
changing a tire.

203
00:11:33,514 --> 00:11:35,642
She's just attaching it
onto the car.

204
00:11:35,642 --> 00:11:38,978
- That's how you change a tire.
- That's how you change a tire.

205
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:42,899
What's that?

206
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:46,027
Oh, it's...
It's my whistle for Carl.

207
00:11:46,027 --> 00:11:48,655
Ahh!

208
00:11:48,655 --> 00:11:49,948
Wow, that was loud!

209
00:11:50,823 --> 00:11:52,116
Uh, who's Carl?

210
00:11:52,116 --> 00:11:53,910
He's my Dragolizagator.

211
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,161
- He's right there.
-Huh?

212
00:11:57,163 --> 00:11:58,831
Is he really small?

213
00:11:58,831 --> 00:12:00,999
He's got amazing
camouflage abilities.

214
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:01,917
Oh.

215
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:05,295
He's part eagle,
lion, alligator.

216
00:12:05,295 --> 00:12:07,839
You know what, kiddo?
Let's not do Carl today, okay?

217
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,968
Well, he's licking me,

218
00:12:10,968 --> 00:12:12,386
which is a little ticklish.

219
00:12:12,386 --> 00:12:14,596
Oh, that tickles!
But he's lick--

220
00:12:14,596 --> 00:12:16,139
Oh, it tickles! Oh, it tickles!

221
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:18,308
- He's going after you.
- He's going after you, Moose!

222
00:12:18,308 --> 00:12:19,685
Don't worry.
He's just trying to sniff you

223
00:12:19,685 --> 00:12:20,769
to see if you're friendly.

224
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:23,188
I'm a moose. Get your sniff on.

225
00:12:25,065 --> 00:12:27,567
By the way,
I'm Terry and this is Mel.

226
00:12:28,151 --> 00:12:29,528
Hi, I'm Harold.

227
00:12:29,528 --> 00:12:30,821
Moose again.

228
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:32,364
I'm so sorry for everything.

229
00:12:32,364 --> 00:12:33,865
Can I give you guys
a ride somewhere?

230
00:12:33,865 --> 00:12:35,409
It's the least I can do.

231
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:36,660
Sure.

232
00:12:46,128 --> 00:12:47,671
Old Man!

233
00:12:47,671 --> 00:12:48,797
No! Stop!

234
00:12:48,797 --> 00:12:50,173
Hi!

235
00:12:50,173 --> 00:12:52,301
My goodness.
What is it with you people?

236
00:12:52,301 --> 00:12:53,927
It's me, Porcupine.

237
00:12:53,927 --> 00:12:56,053
If you don't want any trouble,
you better get out of here.

238
00:12:56,053 --> 00:12:57,888
What are you doing?

239
00:12:59,682 --> 00:13:02,018
Aw. No quills.

240
00:13:02,018 --> 00:13:03,811
This really
is a brand-new world.

241
00:13:11,277 --> 00:13:12,945
I'm glad you guys are okay.

242
00:13:12,945 --> 00:13:15,907
And that you're not litigious.

243
00:13:17,116 --> 00:13:19,160
Sorry about hitting you
back there.

244
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,745
Uh, where can I drop you off?

245
00:13:20,745 --> 00:13:23,205
Uh, well, the old man's house
would be great.

246
00:13:23,205 --> 00:13:24,874
You mean your dad?

247
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:29,086
Yeah. I mean,
I guess you could call him that.

248
00:13:29,086 --> 00:13:30,004
If it weren't for him,

249
00:13:30,004 --> 00:13:32,131
I wouldn't exist, so...

250
00:13:32,131 --> 00:13:33,257
Where does he live?

251
00:13:33,966 --> 00:13:36,677
Well, we were hoping
that you would know.

252
00:13:36,677 --> 00:13:38,679
- Where your dad lives?
- Yes.

253
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:41,641
Uh, no, I do not know that.

254
00:13:41,641 --> 00:13:44,226
But I'm happy to drop you
at a bus station

255
00:13:44,226 --> 00:13:45,937
or wherever
you're staying tonight.

256
00:13:45,937 --> 00:13:47,396
Well, we don't exactly know

257
00:13:47,396 --> 00:13:49,607
where we're gonna stay
tonight just yet.

258
00:13:49,607 --> 00:13:52,692
Yeah. And you're the only people
we actually know, so...

259
00:13:52,692 --> 00:13:54,277
They can stay with us.

260
00:13:54,277 --> 00:13:55,779
New friends! Yay!

261
00:13:55,779 --> 00:13:58,240
Oh, gosh, that would be so fun.

262
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,991
But we don't have a room.

263
00:13:59,991 --> 00:14:02,285
Yeah, we do, Mom.
Above the garage.

264
00:14:02,285 --> 00:14:04,079
No, Mel,
they're not staying with us.

265
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,082
I'm sorry, we just don't
know you, really, at all.

266
00:14:07,082 --> 00:14:08,541
Mom, we can't just abandon them.

267
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:09,960
You hit them,
you broke their bike.

268
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,628
And they don't
have anywhere to stay.

269
00:14:12,796 --> 00:14:15,173
Dad always said,
"When people need help..."

270
00:14:15,966 --> 00:14:17,384
"We help."

271
00:14:17,384 --> 00:14:19,803
Yeah. Yeah, we do say that.

272
00:14:21,096 --> 00:14:23,473
Okay, fine.

273
00:14:23,473 --> 00:14:25,308
One night. Above the garage.

274
00:14:26,393 --> 00:14:27,477
Yes!

275
00:14:27,477 --> 00:14:28,687
Wow, that's a lot of emphasis

276
00:14:28,687 --> 00:14:29,980
- on "Above the garage."
- Yeah.

277
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,523
Just don't get
too excited, okay?

278
00:14:32,565 --> 00:14:35,986
That's what people
say when it's really exciting.

279
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,738
Above the garage!

280
00:14:38,738 --> 00:14:42,409
Above the garage!
Above the garage!

281
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:43,743
Is this your house?

282
00:14:43,743 --> 00:14:45,203
Ooh, nice!

283
00:14:48,164 --> 00:14:49,331
Home sweet home.

284
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,043
Could use a new coat of paint
and a new roof,

285
00:14:53,043 --> 00:14:55,170
and a lot of other things.

286
00:14:55,754 --> 00:14:57,423
I think it looks great.

287
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:00,801
Here's the palace.

288
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,763
Oh, Terry, this is amazing!

289
00:15:04,763 --> 00:15:07,224
Do you see this?
She has a wall bed.

290
00:15:07,224 --> 00:15:08,892
This is so classy.

291
00:15:08,892 --> 00:15:11,562
How did you know
I sleep standin' up?

292
00:15:11,562 --> 00:15:12,646
Oh, you know what,

293
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:14,857
I never got around to donating
any of these clothes,

294
00:15:14,857 --> 00:15:16,734
so please help yourself
to anything that fits you.

295
00:15:16,734 --> 00:15:18,110
What's this music?

296
00:15:19,028 --> 00:15:22,364
Oh, that would be nothing.
Just junk from my old life.

297
00:15:23,365 --> 00:15:24,617
You're a musician.

298
00:15:24,617 --> 00:15:26,285
Yeah, I was.

299
00:15:26,285 --> 00:15:27,661
I just, you know...

300
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:31,123
When you're young,
you have all kinds of dreams,

301
00:15:31,123 --> 00:15:34,043
and then the world
just kicks it out of you.

302
00:15:34,043 --> 00:15:35,419
I've never been kicked before,

303
00:15:35,419 --> 00:15:37,755
but I was hit by a guy
with a cane.

304
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,465
So I hear ya.

305
00:15:39,465 --> 00:15:42,676
Now I stock shelves
at Ollie's.

306
00:15:44,053 --> 00:15:45,386
You know, uh,

307
00:15:45,386 --> 00:15:46,471
Ollie's?

308
00:15:47,472 --> 00:15:49,140
It's like a store
that sells everything.

309
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,850
You work at a store
that sells everything?

310
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,310
That sounds like
the best job ever.

311
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,896
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Ollie's is the best job ever.

312
00:15:54,896 --> 00:15:56,022
Yes, it is.

313
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:58,691
Kudos. Good thing
you don't do music anymore,

314
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:01,402
you wouldn't have an amazing job
like Ollie's!

315
00:16:01,402 --> 00:16:02,612
Yeah.

316
00:16:02,612 --> 00:16:03,696
I hate my job.

317
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,823
Um, anyway, what do you guys do?

318
00:16:06,449 --> 00:16:08,243
Well, I draw.

319
00:16:08,243 --> 00:16:10,328
- Hmm. An artist.
- Yeah.

320
00:16:11,955 --> 00:16:12,914
Um...

321
00:16:14,415 --> 00:16:15,458
What do you do?

322
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,252
Besides that?

323
00:16:17,835 --> 00:16:19,587
I basically
just follow him around

324
00:16:19,587 --> 00:16:20,880
in a moose-like fashion.

325
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,841
Every day.

326
00:16:25,468 --> 00:16:27,011
Okay. Well, um...

327
00:16:27,595 --> 00:16:29,222
I'm gonna triple lock the door,

328
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:32,100
just, you know,
to keep any weirdos out.

329
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,894
You guys can hit the road
in the morning. 'Kay?

330
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:36,145
Enjoy.

331
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:38,523
- Thank you, Terry.
- Mm-hmm.

332
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:43,485
Moose, we are so lucky.

333
00:16:43,485 --> 00:16:45,237
Look at all this!

334
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,863
Are we lucky, Harold?

335
00:16:46,863 --> 00:16:49,283
I don't think we belong
here in the Real World.

336
00:16:49,283 --> 00:16:52,202
You know, with all the pain.
It's just all so different.

337
00:16:52,202 --> 00:16:54,580
Well, of course
it's different, buddy.

338
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,747
It's a different world.

339
00:16:55,747 --> 00:16:58,000
It's the Real World.
It's an adventure.

340
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,127
That's kind of fun, right?

341
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:01,962
Hey, look.
We'll find the old man,

342
00:17:01,962 --> 00:17:03,422
he'll start narrating again,

343
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,424
and then everything
will go back to normal.

344
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,509
- Then we go home?
- Yeah.

345
00:17:10,886 --> 00:17:13,015
He made a bicycle with a crayon.

346
00:17:13,015 --> 00:17:15,350
Then she says she's a porcupine.

347
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,476
"Porcupine."

348
00:17:16,476 --> 00:17:18,478
Well, you did the right thing
by calling us.

349
00:17:18,478 --> 00:17:20,146
We're gonna put together
a special task force,

350
00:17:20,146 --> 00:17:22,607
and, uh, we'll definitely
keep you updated.

351
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:24,860
- Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.
-Yes, sir. Thank you.

352
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,737
First thing
you learn in this job,

353
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:29,489
gotta humor the crazies.

354
00:17:50,801 --> 00:17:52,053
Old Man.

355
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,068
That's Pandaconda.

356
00:18:07,068 --> 00:18:08,569
- Half panda, half snake.
- Mm.

357
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,198
And this one's half platypus,
half possum.

358
00:18:12,198 --> 00:18:14,158
A Platypossum. Genius.

359
00:18:14,158 --> 00:18:15,952
Because a platypus

360
00:18:15,952 --> 00:18:18,996
is basically already an animal
mashup anyway. So, you know...

361
00:18:18,996 --> 00:18:21,582
You get more bang for your buck.
Thank you.

362
00:18:21,582 --> 00:18:22,833
Yeah.

363
00:18:24,126 --> 00:18:25,253
This one's Carl.

364
00:18:25,253 --> 00:18:27,338
Well, you captured
him perfectly.

365
00:18:27,338 --> 00:18:29,131
I handed that one in
for art class,

366
00:18:29,131 --> 00:18:30,466
and I got an "unsatisfactory."

367
00:18:30,466 --> 00:18:32,343
Clearly some people
have no vision.

368
00:18:32,343 --> 00:18:35,679
I really wanted a dog
but I'm allergic,

369
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,514
so Dad got me Carl.

370
00:18:37,514 --> 00:18:40,433
And we used to play
with him all the time. Mom too.

371
00:18:41,601 --> 00:18:44,688
But that was before my dad died.

372
00:18:45,897 --> 00:18:46,898
Oh.

373
00:18:47,774 --> 00:18:50,318
And, um, by "died" you mean...

374
00:18:51,987 --> 00:18:53,572
Stopped living.

375
00:18:56,116 --> 00:18:57,951
Oh, right, right. Right.

376
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:00,745
Now Mom's always stressed out

377
00:19:01,788 --> 00:19:02,872
and I wish...

378
00:19:03,665 --> 00:19:04,791
You wish what?

379
00:19:06,334 --> 00:19:09,170
I don't know, I just want her
to be happy, you know?

380
00:19:09,963 --> 00:19:11,381
Like she used to be.

381
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:13,216
Well, maybe I can help.

382
00:19:14,217 --> 00:19:15,719
Maybe we could help each other.

383
00:19:16,303 --> 00:19:17,679
Yeah, like,
you make my mom happy,

384
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,222
and I'll help you find your dad.

385
00:19:20,765 --> 00:19:21,766
Deal.

386
00:19:21,766 --> 00:19:23,476
Oh.

387
00:19:23,977 --> 00:19:24,978
What? Oh.

388
00:19:29,065 --> 00:19:32,526
So how did you make that tire?
I really gotta know.

389
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,908
With this.

390
00:19:50,711 --> 00:19:52,004
Here. Now you try.

391
00:19:54,006 --> 00:19:55,090
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

392
00:19:55,674 --> 00:19:56,717
How does it work?

393
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,803
I've never really
thought about it.

394
00:19:59,803 --> 00:20:00,888
The old man gave it to me

395
00:20:00,888 --> 00:20:03,098
so I just always believed
that it would.

396
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,898
What is this?

397
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:19,907
That's Spiderfly.

398
00:20:20,532 --> 00:20:21,700
Now, that is creative.

399
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:25,788
And terrifying.

400
00:20:25,788 --> 00:20:28,248
- That's... That's terrifying.
- Yeah. Here.

401
00:20:28,248 --> 00:20:29,999
Thank-- We should prob-- Okay.

402
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:31,125
Run!

403
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,586
Mel, look out. I think I'm just
gonna sneak out of here.

404
00:20:33,586 --> 00:20:35,713
-It's poisonous.
- Why did you make it poisonous?

405
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,091
Harold?

406
00:20:39,384 --> 00:20:40,551
It's cold.

407
00:20:41,803 --> 00:20:43,805
I need you to draw me a jacket.

408
00:20:44,806 --> 00:20:46,266
Purple!

409
00:20:47,976 --> 00:20:50,353
He's been here.

410
00:20:57,443 --> 00:20:59,404
Aw. Hey, friend.

411
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,084
Wow, this is real power.

412
00:21:19,007 --> 00:21:19,882
Hmm.

413
00:21:21,175 --> 00:21:22,385
That'll do.

414
00:21:28,765 --> 00:21:30,267
Hello, beautiful.

415
00:21:34,229 --> 00:21:36,231
Hey, whoever's down there,
I called the cops.

416
00:21:36,231 --> 00:21:37,357
They're on their way.

417
00:22:07,304 --> 00:22:08,472
What was that?

418
00:22:17,814 --> 00:22:19,315
We have it every day.

419
00:22:19,315 --> 00:22:21,400
The best ever.

420
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:25,988
Oh, good morning, Terry!

421
00:22:27,156 --> 00:22:29,075
Where'd those pies come from?

422
00:22:29,075 --> 00:22:30,701
Harold made them.

423
00:22:30,701 --> 00:22:33,788
Okay, well,
pies are not breakfast.

424
00:22:33,788 --> 00:22:35,665
I'mma pretend I didn't hear
what you just said.

425
00:22:35,665 --> 00:22:38,084
Pie is definitely
breakfast. Right.

426
00:22:38,084 --> 00:22:39,377
Okay.

427
00:22:43,714 --> 00:22:45,341
My house is purple.

428
00:22:45,341 --> 00:22:47,176
Oh, yeah-yeah, yeah.

429
00:22:47,176 --> 00:22:50,638
Well, you said it needed
some new paint,

430
00:22:50,638 --> 00:22:52,515
so I thought I would make it
more cheerful

431
00:22:52,515 --> 00:22:54,600
and then you wouldn't be
so unhappy all the time.

432
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,102
Mom, Harold can do magic.

433
00:22:56,102 --> 00:22:58,437
He can literally make anything.

434
00:22:58,437 --> 00:23:02,817
Uh, I wouldn't call it magic,
per se. It's more of a science.

435
00:23:02,817 --> 00:23:04,443
I've been trying
to keep it a secret,

436
00:23:04,443 --> 00:23:06,028
but with this little guy,

437
00:23:06,028 --> 00:23:07,905
I can basically make
whatever I want.

438
00:23:07,905 --> 00:23:09,615
Okay, can we talk for a sec?

439
00:23:10,491 --> 00:23:13,369
Okay. Um,
I'm already dealing with,

440
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:15,454
like, an imaginary
dragon-lizard-lion

441
00:23:15,454 --> 00:23:16,705
situation right now,

442
00:23:16,705 --> 00:23:18,873
so can we not do
magic crayons, please?

443
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:23,253
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
No, sure, Terry.

444
00:23:23,253 --> 00:23:24,504
Okay. Great.

445
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:26,298
Mom, I need to help Harold
look for his dad.

446
00:23:26,298 --> 00:23:27,924
Oh, no.
You need to go to school.

447
00:23:27,924 --> 00:23:29,342
And I need to go to work.

448
00:23:29,342 --> 00:23:31,886
And these guys gotta go.
They gotta go.

449
00:23:32,971 --> 00:23:35,724
Okay? Time to stop eating pie.
We all have to leave.

450
00:23:35,724 --> 00:23:37,851
No more pie. Say bye.

451
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:39,102
Hey, Mel.

452
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,237
- Really?
- Yeah.

453
00:23:49,821 --> 00:23:50,822
Thanks.

454
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,575
Bye, Mel. Have a good day.

455
00:23:53,575 --> 00:23:55,035
- Thank you, Terry.
-Yep.

456
00:23:55,827 --> 00:23:57,162
- Bye.
-Bye.

457
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:00,165
All right,
let's find your dad.

458
00:24:00,165 --> 00:24:01,958
Wait, don't you have to
go to school?

459
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,293
I am going to school.

460
00:24:03,293 --> 00:24:05,795
Just by a super-long
indirect way.

461
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:07,881
- Thanks, Mel.
- Yeah.

462
00:24:09,007 --> 00:24:10,759
Wish we had more of that pie.

463
00:24:11,384 --> 00:24:13,052
Yeah, no. No, no, no.

464
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:14,929
Listen, we gotta respect
your mom's rules.

465
00:24:14,929 --> 00:24:16,263
No more pie.

466
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:19,433
Harold, you are a genius.

467
00:24:19,433 --> 00:24:21,477
- This is way better than pies.
- Yeah.

468
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:25,356
Look, if we're gonna find
your dad, we need a plan.

469
00:24:25,356 --> 00:24:26,565
I'm way ahead of you.

470
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:28,275
We're just gonna walk around,
looking for old men.

471
00:24:28,275 --> 00:24:29,985
How hard could that be?

472
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,699
- Old Man!
- No, that's--

473
00:24:35,699 --> 00:24:37,826
Old Man! It's me! It's Harold!

474
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:41,247
Who you calling old, punk!

475
00:24:41,247 --> 00:24:42,873
Sorry, Mr. Perez.

476
00:24:42,873 --> 00:24:47,002
Oh, this is... This is gonna be
a lot harder than I thought.

477
00:24:47,002 --> 00:24:49,088
Maybe we need
to come up with a better plan.

478
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:56,011
"Place to go
when you need to know anything"?

479
00:24:56,011 --> 00:24:57,263
That's it, that's what we do.

480
00:24:57,263 --> 00:24:59,348
The library,
it's kind of a long walk.

481
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:01,350
"Walk"? Who said walk?

482
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:12,610
Wait, guys! Wait for me!

483
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,864
Wait a minute,
I'm a moose on roller skates!

484
00:25:16,864 --> 00:25:18,241
I'm doing it!

485
00:25:18,241 --> 00:25:19,617
Oh, I think I'm getting
the hang of it!

486
00:25:19,617 --> 00:25:20,577
No, I don't! Aah!

487
00:25:24,831 --> 00:25:26,874
No, wait!

488
00:25:28,585 --> 00:25:29,419
Oh, yeah.

489
00:25:36,175 --> 00:25:37,719
Whoa, whoa...

490
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:39,971
Let's go!

491
00:25:40,847 --> 00:25:42,098
Whoa!

492
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,529
- Ugh.
- What's wrong?

493
00:25:57,196 --> 00:25:58,197
You'll see.

494
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:10,334
"'The Glaive,' chortled
the sorcerer Gondaldemor.

495
00:26:10,334 --> 00:26:13,211
'It's the most powerful weapon
in the universe.

496
00:26:13,211 --> 00:26:16,006
Only a fool
would dare wield it.'

497
00:26:16,006 --> 00:26:17,758
He stepped forward,

498
00:26:17,758 --> 00:26:20,218
his abs rippling
like liquid stone,

499
00:26:20,218 --> 00:26:24,598
his pecs set upon them
like two impenetrable boulders,

500
00:26:24,598 --> 00:26:26,308
only distinguishable as human...

501
00:26:26,308 --> 00:26:28,185
...by the perfectly shaped

502
00:26:28,185 --> 00:26:30,687
yet masculine nipples
they flaunted.

503
00:26:30,687 --> 00:26:32,105
Ah.

504
00:26:32,105 --> 00:26:35,108
- Let's go.
- 'The name's G'Garaur.'"

505
00:26:35,859 --> 00:26:37,611
Amazing.

506
00:26:37,611 --> 00:26:39,279
A big round of applause

507
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,950
for our head librarian,
Gary Natwick,

508
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:44,409
reading from his novel...

509
00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:45,494
She's gone.

510
00:26:45,494 --> 00:26:47,621
<i>...The Glaive of G'Ga--</i>

511
00:26:47,621 --> 00:26:49,539
<i>G'Garaur.</i>
It's not that hard.

512
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:51,333
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

513
00:26:53,168 --> 00:26:56,546
Ah. Mel, hi. Thanks for coming.

514
00:26:56,546 --> 00:27:00,467
And hi,
Mel's imaginary dragon thingy.

515
00:27:00,467 --> 00:27:03,844
You're touching his butt.

516
00:27:03,844 --> 00:27:04,929
Sorry.

517
00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:07,682
These are my friends
Harold and Moose.

518
00:27:08,432 --> 00:27:09,767
Harold and Moose?

519
00:27:09,767 --> 00:27:12,103
Yes, I've changed
quite a bit recently,

520
00:27:12,103 --> 00:27:13,396
but I'm still the same inside.

521
00:27:13,396 --> 00:27:16,232
You know, I'm vegetarian,
I'm pretty nimble, I'm docile.

522
00:27:16,232 --> 00:27:18,192
But the greatest thing
about me is

523
00:27:18,192 --> 00:27:20,861
I'm a wanderer by nature.

524
00:27:20,861 --> 00:27:23,114
And that's what I'm about to do.

525
00:27:23,114 --> 00:27:24,574
Some wandering.

526
00:27:25,449 --> 00:27:26,617
Enjoy.

527
00:27:26,617 --> 00:27:28,536
Uh, how many pages is that?

528
00:27:28,536 --> 00:27:30,079
Seven hundred pages.

529
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,789
That is so many pages.

530
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:33,207
That must have taken you
weeks to write.

531
00:27:33,207 --> 00:27:34,625
Try months, my friend.

532
00:27:35,209 --> 00:27:37,253
I'm currently shopping it
to publishers.

533
00:27:37,837 --> 00:27:40,339
There's probably
going to be a bidding war.

534
00:27:40,339 --> 00:27:43,175
Mel.
That looks just like your mom.

535
00:27:45,636 --> 00:27:46,637
No.

536
00:27:47,221 --> 00:27:49,974
That's Zerry, my warrior queen.

537
00:27:49,974 --> 00:27:52,310
I mean G'Garaur's warrior queen.

538
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:56,105
How is your beautiful mother?
Tell her hi from Library Gary.

539
00:27:56,105 --> 00:27:57,898
We met in college.

540
00:27:57,898 --> 00:28:00,025
And how do you know Terry?

541
00:28:00,025 --> 00:28:03,236
You're not, uh,
seeing her, are you?

542
00:28:03,236 --> 00:28:04,362
Oh, I saw her this morning.

543
00:28:04,362 --> 00:28:05,989
But that's because
we stayed the night.

544
00:28:05,989 --> 00:28:07,532
And I saw her yesterday.

545
00:28:07,532 --> 00:28:10,035
Yeah. We've been seeing
a lot of each other, so...

546
00:28:10,035 --> 00:28:11,620
But that's not why we're here.

547
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:14,039
We're here because I really
need your help, Library Gary.

548
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:17,125
I'm really trying
to find my old man.

549
00:28:17,709 --> 00:28:20,712
We're a library.
We don't do missing persons.

550
00:28:21,838 --> 00:28:23,048
My mom always talks

551
00:28:23,048 --> 00:28:24,925
about what an amazing
librarian you are.

552
00:28:24,925 --> 00:28:26,009
She does?

553
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:28,678
Yeah. How you can find
information about anything.

554
00:28:28,678 --> 00:28:29,971
She said that?

555
00:28:29,971 --> 00:28:31,681
Well, sorry, Harold.

556
00:28:32,182 --> 00:28:33,558
Gary can't do it.

557
00:28:34,142 --> 00:28:36,519
My mom will be so disappointed.

558
00:28:38,104 --> 00:28:39,189
Wait.

559
00:28:41,441 --> 00:28:42,734
For your mother...

560
00:28:44,236 --> 00:28:45,362
anything.

561
00:28:45,946 --> 00:28:47,364
All right,
what's your dad's name?

562
00:28:47,864 --> 00:28:49,241
Funny thing, I don't know.

563
00:28:49,241 --> 00:28:50,909
I really don't know. Um...

564
00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:52,285
But I know he's an old man,

565
00:28:52,285 --> 00:28:53,869
and I know
that he's in the Real World.

566
00:28:55,204 --> 00:28:56,288
Okay.

567
00:28:56,288 --> 00:28:57,414
Old man.

568
00:28:58,082 --> 00:28:59,416
Planet Earth.

569
00:28:59,416 --> 00:29:02,253
And that brings up
500 million people.

570
00:29:02,253 --> 00:29:05,631
Um... Ooh, ooh, ooh. Uh...

571
00:29:05,631 --> 00:29:06,966
Say "kind."

572
00:29:06,966 --> 00:29:08,550
- And then...
- Wise.

573
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,468
And "wise."

574
00:29:09,468 --> 00:29:10,970
And he talks like this.

575
00:29:12,972 --> 00:29:14,890
Okay. I'll enter that
into the mainframe.

576
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:16,433
And clackity-clack-clack.

577
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:17,977
And none of this is helpful.

578
00:29:17,977 --> 00:29:20,062
Let's go, guys,
we're wasting our time.

579
00:29:20,062 --> 00:29:22,231
I'm just saying
that if this is all you've got,

580
00:29:22,231 --> 00:29:23,482
you're never gonna find him.

581
00:29:25,484 --> 00:29:26,777
Unless...

582
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,779
Unless...

583
00:29:29,822 --> 00:29:30,864
he finds us.

584
00:29:30,864 --> 00:29:32,241
Exactly!

585
00:29:32,241 --> 00:29:33,993
Which is gonna be difficult

586
00:29:33,993 --> 00:29:36,370
because he doesn't know
that we're looking for him.

587
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,538
Unless...

588
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,207
Unless...

589
00:29:45,546 --> 00:29:47,756
- What?
- I don't know. That's-- I was--

590
00:29:47,756 --> 00:29:50,300
Maybe you could fly in the air
in a little plane

591
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,052
and write messages to him
in the sky.

592
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:58,725
And that's why you
ask a librarian. Genius.

593
00:29:59,309 --> 00:30:00,560
Let's go have some fun.

594
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,770
- Yes.
- Purple crayon.

595
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,063
It's kind of my thing, so...

596
00:30:04,063 --> 00:30:04,981
Cute.

597
00:30:04,981 --> 00:30:06,274
Thank you for your help.

598
00:30:28,171 --> 00:30:29,005
Whoa.

599
00:30:29,005 --> 00:30:31,215
<i>Yes, well, unfortunately,</i>

600
00:30:31,215 --> 00:30:34,010
<i>we've decided to pass
on</i> The Glaive of...

601
00:30:34,761 --> 00:30:36,763
<i>- G'Garaur.
- Whatever.</i>

602
00:30:36,763 --> 00:30:39,098
G'Garaur. It's not that hard.

603
00:30:39,098 --> 00:30:40,433
<i>It is hard.</i>

604
00:30:40,433 --> 00:30:41,517
<i>You don't want a book</i>

605
00:30:41,517 --> 00:30:43,311
<i>where people can't even
say the title.</i>

606
00:30:43,311 --> 00:30:46,897
You're just like all the others,
Yasmin. You don't get it.

607
00:30:46,897 --> 00:30:48,440
My world is bigger

608
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,778
than Hogwarts and Middle-earth
and Narnia combined.

609
00:30:52,778 --> 00:30:54,488
<i>Okay.</i>

610
00:30:56,823 --> 00:30:58,283
<i>Don't know what that means.</i>

611
00:30:58,283 --> 00:30:59,952
It means,
"Thank you for your time.

612
00:30:59,952 --> 00:31:01,912
"I hope you reconsider."

613
00:31:17,344 --> 00:31:18,554
Ta-da!

614
00:31:18,554 --> 00:31:22,432
<i>Harold and the Purple Crayon.</i>

615
00:31:26,645 --> 00:31:27,896
Anybody ever heard the term

616
00:31:27,896 --> 00:31:29,606
"when a moose flies"?

617
00:31:29,606 --> 00:31:33,569
No! 'Cause moose don't fly.
I am a land animal.

618
00:31:33,569 --> 00:31:36,363
Statistically,
planes are safer than cars.

619
00:31:36,363 --> 00:31:38,240
What about a plane
drawn by Harold?

620
00:31:39,491 --> 00:31:42,785
- It's gonna be great.
- It's gonna be great.

621
00:31:42,785 --> 00:31:45,413
Statistically,
what does that mean?

622
00:31:45,413 --> 00:31:49,625
"Harold left a very hungry moose
and a deserving porcupine

623
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:50,793
"to finish it
where he was."

624
00:31:51,168 --> 00:31:52,253
Hey!

625
00:31:52,253 --> 00:31:54,672
Quiet, please.
This is a library.

626
00:31:56,841 --> 00:32:00,636
{\an8}With that crayon,
I can show them my world.

627
00:32:10,104 --> 00:32:11,981
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Watch out, red light!

628
00:32:11,981 --> 00:32:13,691
Oh!

629
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:19,155
This is awesome!

630
00:32:19,155 --> 00:32:21,157
- Whoo!
- Look out!

631
00:32:21,157 --> 00:32:22,992
What? I can't--

632
00:32:22,992 --> 00:32:24,619
Actually, hold on a second.

633
00:32:26,329 --> 00:32:27,246
Whoa.

634
00:32:33,294 --> 00:32:35,254
Sorry about that,
buddy. What were you saying?

635
00:32:35,546 --> 00:32:37,089
I said, "Look out!"

636
00:32:37,089 --> 00:32:38,007
Oh.

637
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:42,010
That was close, huh?

638
00:32:46,014 --> 00:32:47,974
We should leave a phone number.

639
00:32:47,974 --> 00:32:50,644
But my mom says that I can't
give my number to strangers.

640
00:32:50,644 --> 00:32:53,146
She didn't say you couldn't
give her number to strangers.

641
00:33:02,405 --> 00:33:04,699
Mmh-mmh.

642
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:15,085
It's working!

643
00:33:16,002 --> 00:33:19,381
Woo-hoo!

644
00:33:41,443 --> 00:33:43,153
Harold!

645
00:33:43,153 --> 00:33:45,114
Ooh.
Sorry, Moose. Sorry!

646
00:33:48,617 --> 00:33:51,161
Harold! Get me out
the air! Land this thing!

647
00:33:51,161 --> 00:33:52,621
That's not nearly as fun.

648
00:33:52,621 --> 00:33:54,498
Hang on!

649
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,211
Yeah!

650
00:34:00,754 --> 00:34:02,882
See? Now that is fun.

651
00:34:02,882 --> 00:34:04,300
Look, that's my school.

652
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,885
All right!
Let's get you down there.

653
00:34:09,763 --> 00:34:12,515
It looks like it's gonna be
another perfect landing, folks.

654
00:34:12,515 --> 00:34:14,977
So just sit back, relax and--

655
00:34:14,977 --> 00:34:16,477
- Oh!
-Whoa, whoa...

656
00:34:20,232 --> 00:34:22,026
I can't believe
we're still rolling.

657
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:23,944
I feel like
I'm in a washing machine.

658
00:34:27,113 --> 00:34:28,823
Maybe pie isn't breakfast.

659
00:34:36,414 --> 00:34:37,831
We gotta do that again.

660
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:40,668
Oh, hey!

661
00:34:40,668 --> 00:34:42,670
- All right.
-Whoa.

662
00:34:43,588 --> 00:34:45,255
Well, good luck
finding your old man.

663
00:34:45,255 --> 00:34:47,507
Thanks. Have fun at school.

664
00:34:51,094 --> 00:34:53,181
- Huh. Look at this.
- Hmm?

665
00:34:57,894 --> 00:34:58,937
Hello.

666
00:34:58,937 --> 00:35:01,189
Hey. I saw your number
in the sky.

667
00:35:01,189 --> 00:35:02,440
What?

668
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,816
I figured it was a sign.

669
00:35:03,816 --> 00:35:06,069
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

670
00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:08,238
I could be your old man
if you'll be my old lady.

671
00:35:08,238 --> 00:35:11,032
I think you have
the wrong number. Okay?

672
00:35:11,032 --> 00:35:12,825
- Hello?
-<i>Hello?</i>

673
00:35:12,825 --> 00:35:14,577
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hello?

674
00:35:14,577 --> 00:35:17,747
Yeah, uh, I got your message
in the sky.

675
00:35:17,747 --> 00:35:19,874
Let me guess. You're an old man.

676
00:35:19,874 --> 00:35:20,959
<i>Yeah.</i>

677
00:35:20,959 --> 00:35:23,169
- Hello?
- Hello?

678
00:35:23,169 --> 00:35:24,754
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hello?

679
00:35:24,754 --> 00:35:26,548
How old of a guy
are you looking for?

680
00:35:26,548 --> 00:35:29,049
- Is this some kind of joke?
<i>- No, no, no.</i>

681
00:35:29,049 --> 00:35:30,759
You left me a message
in the sky.

682
00:35:30,759 --> 00:35:32,094
That wasn't me. So...

683
00:35:32,094 --> 00:35:33,512
I can't hear you.

684
00:35:33,512 --> 00:35:35,597
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

685
00:35:35,597 --> 00:35:36,807
Please stop calling me.

686
00:35:54,408 --> 00:35:56,618
- You're late, Melvin.
- Where've you been, weirdo?

687
00:35:56,618 --> 00:35:57,869
- Give me this.
- Stop.

688
00:35:57,869 --> 00:35:59,997
- Where you goin'?
- Let go of me!

689
00:35:59,997 --> 00:36:02,249
Bro.

690
00:36:02,249 --> 00:36:04,042
You just hit my bro.

691
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:07,546
What's with the noise?
What's going on?

692
00:36:07,546 --> 00:36:09,423
Principal's office, now.

693
00:36:14,511 --> 00:36:15,804
There it is.

694
00:36:16,513 --> 00:36:18,140
The store that sells everything.

695
00:36:18,724 --> 00:36:20,893
Come on, let's go find Terry.

696
00:36:23,228 --> 00:36:25,855
Oh, Moose! Miniature train ride!

697
00:36:26,397 --> 00:36:27,440
No, Moose!

698
00:36:29,775 --> 00:36:31,986
What?
What are you doin', man?

699
00:36:31,986 --> 00:36:35,406
Wow.
Whoa!

700
00:36:36,407 --> 00:36:38,409
This place is next level!

701
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:43,122
Wow!

702
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,542
This place
has everything!

703
00:36:46,542 --> 00:36:48,377
Cheese... balls?

704
00:36:49,045 --> 00:36:51,297
It's like cheese, but puffier.

705
00:36:51,964 --> 00:36:54,133
Wow. Oh,
and they have these things!

706
00:36:54,133 --> 00:36:55,468
Whatever these are.

707
00:36:55,468 --> 00:36:58,304
Like scarves,
but soft and heavy.

00:37:12,777 --> 00:37:16,572
Hi. I'm old. I'm, like, 40.

715
00:37:16,572 --> 00:37:18,616
Okay. Can I talk
to your mom, please?

716
00:37:18,616 --> 00:37:20,784

Terry.

718
00:37:26,539 --> 00:37:29,167
What did we say
about personal calls?

719
00:37:29,167 --> 00:37:30,293
Oh, it was a wrong num--

720
00:37:30,293 --> 00:37:32,837
I've had like
600 wrong numbers today, sorry.

721
00:37:32,837 --> 00:37:34,422
Terry, I started out
just like you,

722
00:37:34,422 --> 00:37:35,674
busting my hump on the floor.

723
00:37:35,674 --> 00:37:37,050
Right.

724
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:39,094
But 12 years later...

725
00:37:43,557 --> 00:37:44,808
- I'm a manager.
- Manager.

726
00:37:44,808 --> 00:37:47,102
- Okay? Dreams do come true.
- Yep.

727
00:37:47,102 --> 00:37:49,104
- But you have to work for them.
- Right.

728
00:37:49,104 --> 00:37:50,939
- I have an opportunity for you.
- Mm-hmm.

729
00:37:50,939 --> 00:37:52,399
I've got a backlogged stockroom.

730
00:37:52,399 --> 00:37:55,443
This could be your moment.
Are you ready to take your shot?

731
00:37:55,443 --> 00:37:57,946
- You just try and stop me.
- Great.

732
00:37:58,863 --> 00:38:00,657
- This is your last warning.
- Okay.

733
00:38:00,657 --> 00:38:01,741
Great.

734

What are you guys doing here?

740
00:38:21,927 --> 00:38:24,597
Hi, Terry.
Hey, did my old man call yet?

741
00:38:24,597 --> 00:38:27,975
Oh, no.
Your old man has not called.

742
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:29,018
Oh.

743
00:38:29,018 --> 00:38:31,770
But old men are calling me
every 15 seconds.

744
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,480
Do you have something
to do with that?

745
00:38:34,315 --> 00:38:36,150
You guys gotta
get out of here, okay?

746
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,818
I'm this close to losing my job.

747
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:39,612
Oh, congrats.
You hated this job.

748
00:38:39,612 --> 00:38:41,322
No, I love this job.
Hey, Prasad.

749
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:44,366
Okay, well, I am very confused.

750
00:38:45,534 --> 00:38:47,536
Will you idiots
stop calling me?

751
00:38:47,536 --> 00:38:49,580
Terry? It's Principal Brady.

752
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,707
- Principal Brady? Hi.
<i>- Yes.</i>

753
00:38:51,707 --> 00:38:52,917
Your son Melvin

754
00:38:52,917 --> 00:38:54,752
has been involved
in an incident in school.

755
00:38:54,752 --> 00:38:56,003
- What?
<i>- He's okay.</i>

756
00:38:56,003 --> 00:38:57,087
But I'm afraid we're gonna

757
00:38:57,087 --> 00:38:58,505
have to send him
home for the day.

758
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:02,551
Yeah, no, sorry.
I'll be right there. Okay, bye.

759
00:39:02,551 --> 00:39:04,553
Okay, Mel's in trouble
at school,

760
00:39:04,553 --> 00:39:06,764
but I'm gonna lose my job
if I miss this shift.

761
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:10,517
- When people need help, we help.
- Right.

762
00:39:10,517 --> 00:39:12,269
You know
who I learned that from?

763
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:14,020
From a lady
who hit us with her car.

764
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:14,938
Mm-hmm.

765
00:39:15,438 --> 00:39:16,689
Do you know who that lady is?

766
00:39:18,691 --> 00:39:20,151
- You.
- Me.

767
00:39:22,737 --> 00:39:23,988
This is the stockroom.

768
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:30,703
So you take the boxes,
you look at the label,

769
00:39:30,703 --> 00:39:32,872
and you put them
on the right shelf.

770
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:35,833
Piece of cake, right?

771
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:38,336
I'll be back in an hour.
Thank you.

772
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:45,009
- See? Piece of cake.
- Mm.

773
00:39:50,515 --> 00:39:53,601
I can't take it anymore.
This is soul-crushing.

774
00:39:53,601 --> 00:39:57,146
Oh, God. Having a job in
the Real World is so terrible.

775
00:39:57,146 --> 00:39:59,857
I wouldn't get a job. Why would
anybody wanna get a job?

776
00:39:59,857 --> 00:40:02,569
I don't know. How long
have we been doing this?

777
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:04,028
- Six minutes!
- Aah!

778
00:40:12,494 --> 00:40:13,829
What happened?

779
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:16,790
You're not the kind of kid
who gets into fights.

780
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,208
It was an accident.

781
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:20,043
They tried to take my whistle.

782
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:23,171
Okay. Well, I think
you should forget about Carl

783
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:25,716
and start making
real friends. Okay?

784
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:27,926
Harold believes in Carl.

785
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:30,512
Well, maybe
we shouldn't take life advice

786
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:33,098
from a person
that does crayon magic.

787

We are here to help.

788
00:40:35,726 --> 00:40:38,312
Do you need-- Nope,
you don't need any help. Okay.

This'll be way more fun.

- Honey! Shawn, honey!
- Whoa!

812
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:56,097
I'm flying!

813
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,143
Awesome!

814
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:02,185
Oh!

815
00:42:07,065 --> 00:42:09,025
Whoa...

816
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,825
This is fun, Mom!

817
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:19,119
Whoa!

818
00:42:55,196 --> 00:42:56,948
Hurry up.
Please evacuate the building.

819
00:42:57,574 --> 00:43:00,284
I'm gonna sue you.
And I'm taking these bowls.

820
00:43:02,036 --> 00:43:04,371
- But, Mom, I wanna do it again.
- Shh!

821
00:43:04,955 --> 00:43:06,665
But, Mom!

822
00:43:07,666 --> 00:43:10,461
How did you even do this?
I actually wanna know.

823
00:43:10,461 --> 00:43:13,088
- That's a valid question.
- Yeah. I--

824
00:43:13,088 --> 00:43:16,133
Do not say anything
about magic crayons.

825
00:43:17,343 --> 00:43:18,886
What were you thinking?

826
00:43:18,886 --> 00:43:20,679
Oh, honestly, I don't do
a lot of thinking.

827
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:22,806
- I'm more of an improv guy.
- True.

828
00:43:22,806 --> 00:43:23,974
Good news, Terry.

829
00:43:23,974 --> 00:43:26,268
Police are all over
the security tapes.

830
00:43:26,268 --> 00:43:29,271
They'll find out who did this,
and when they do...

831
00:43:29,271 --> 00:43:30,898
...it will not be pretty.

832
00:43:31,857 --> 00:43:33,234
Who are you guys?

833
00:43:33,234 --> 00:43:34,985
We're friends of Terry's,
just filling in.

834
00:43:34,985 --> 00:43:38,489
But I gotta be honest,
your job is super boring.

835
00:43:38,489 --> 00:43:39,907
No wonder you hate it so much.

836
00:43:45,871 --> 00:43:49,166
You do sell pumas, right?
I wasn't wrong about that?

837
00:43:52,461 --> 00:43:54,296
We're really, really sorry.
Is there...

838
00:43:54,296 --> 00:43:56,381
Yeah, is there anything
we can do?

839
00:43:56,381 --> 00:43:59,050
You guys have done plenty.
I think you can stop.

840
00:44:01,386 --> 00:44:04,347
Mom, you did ask them to help.
They did their best.

841
00:44:05,181 --> 00:44:07,016
Besides, you hated that job.

842
00:44:07,016 --> 00:44:09,269
I'm just saying,
maybe now you can find something

843
00:44:09,269 --> 00:44:10,770
that makes you happy.

844
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:15,024
Please?

845
00:44:16,276 --> 00:44:18,778
I did always
wanna trash that place.

846
00:44:20,405 --> 00:44:21,447
Okay.

847
00:44:22,031 --> 00:44:23,116
Come on.

848
00:44:29,622 --> 00:44:31,958
You ever look at your life
and go,

849
00:44:31,958 --> 00:44:33,084
"How'd I end up here?"

850
00:44:33,084 --> 00:44:36,170
I'm asking myself
that question right now.

851
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:38,590
Yeah, I thought I was
gonna be a concert pianist.

852
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:39,674
Wait a second.

853
00:44:39,674 --> 00:44:41,426
Maybe working at Ollie's
wasn't your true passion.

854
00:44:41,426 --> 00:44:42,886
Ya think?

855
00:44:42,886 --> 00:44:45,972
Terry, you need to play piano.
It's who you are.

856
00:44:45,972 --> 00:44:49,893
I don't know, I haven't really
played since my husband died.

857
00:44:49,893 --> 00:44:51,101
I'm a little rusty.

858
00:44:52,394 --> 00:44:56,189
Ice cream truck.
We love ice cream, don't we?

859
00:44:57,107 --> 00:45:00,068
Yeah, yeah, we...
We love ice cream.

860
00:45:00,068 --> 00:45:02,195
Ice cream sounds great.
Let's go. Let's go.

861
00:45:02,195 --> 00:45:04,406
Let's get this ice cream.
Come on, Terry.

862
00:45:04,406 --> 00:45:05,991
Okay.
I don't like it that much.

863
00:45:23,717 --> 00:45:24,760
Um...

864
00:45:25,677 --> 00:45:26,678
How did-- You know what?

865
00:45:26,678 --> 00:45:30,307
I'm not even gonna ask anymore.
This is incredible.

866
00:45:30,307 --> 00:45:31,558
I mean...

867
00:45:31,558 --> 00:45:33,435
Play for us, please.

868
00:45:34,311 --> 00:45:36,104
I don't do that anymore.

869
00:45:36,104 --> 00:45:39,233
Come on, Mom.
You haven't played for so long.

870
00:45:39,233 --> 00:45:41,276
Dad and I used to love it.
Please?

871
00:46:10,888 --> 00:46:12,974
Do these guys
look like criminals to you?

872
00:46:14,016 --> 00:46:15,518
They look like morons.

873
00:46:16,227 --> 00:46:17,895
There's something more to this.

874
00:46:17,895 --> 00:46:19,063
I have witnesses saying

875
00:46:19,063 --> 00:46:21,440
they saw him
making things out of thin air.

876
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,609
You gotta humor the crazies.

877
00:46:26,237 --> 00:46:29,782
Ah. Harold. What a trail of
clues you have left.

878
00:46:40,543 --> 00:46:41,586
Harold?

879
00:46:44,212 --> 00:46:45,297
- Harold?
- Mmh-mmh.

880
00:46:47,048 --> 00:46:48,216
Harold?

881
00:46:49,009 --> 00:46:50,760
Miss? Can I help you?

882
00:46:52,137 --> 00:46:53,430
Yes!

883
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:55,348
Thank God
someone's offering help.

884
00:46:55,348 --> 00:46:56,433
I was beginning to think

885
00:46:56,433 --> 00:46:58,101
the Real World
was full of meanies.

886
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:02,105
Don't do that.
Crayons are for paper, sweetie.

887
00:47:02,105 --> 00:47:04,566
Uh...

888
00:47:04,566 --> 00:47:05,859
Sorry, what did you just say?

889
00:47:05,859 --> 00:47:08,278
She can't just draw
wherever she wants.

890
00:47:08,278 --> 00:47:11,281
Well, you have no idea
what that could've been.

891
00:47:11,281 --> 00:47:12,866
Don't listen to her, mate.

892
00:47:12,866 --> 00:47:15,535
Crayons aren't just for paper.
They are for everywhere.

893
00:47:15,535 --> 00:47:17,537
I can't wait to see
what you make.

894
00:47:17,537 --> 00:47:18,663
If you aren't here to eat,

895
00:47:18,663 --> 00:47:20,582
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

896
00:47:23,376 --> 00:47:24,461
Oh, I'll eat.

897
00:47:34,554 --> 00:47:36,264
You're gonna have to leave now.

898
00:47:40,476 --> 00:47:41,727
Hey!

899
00:47:55,783 --> 00:47:58,035
I'm telling you,
this is all connected.

900
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:07,336
That's her!

901
00:48:09,964 --> 00:48:12,007
You! Get back here!

902
00:48:53,214 --> 00:48:54,340
So good!

903
00:48:55,091 --> 00:48:57,886
No, that was all her.
Well, I mean, I made the piano.

904
00:48:57,886 --> 00:49:00,054
-Harold, Moose, hi.
- Oh, hi.

905
00:49:00,054 --> 00:49:02,682
- Oh, Terry.
- Hi, Gary.

906
00:49:02,682 --> 00:49:05,268
Your music was a golden elixir,

907
00:49:05,268 --> 00:49:07,645
and I drank
until I was intoxicated.

908
00:49:08,229 --> 00:49:09,689
Did you, now?

909
00:49:10,315 --> 00:49:11,649
Thanks, Gary.

910
00:49:11,649 --> 00:49:13,818
Harold, I have wonderful news.

911
00:49:13,818 --> 00:49:16,154
I think I know
who your old man is.

912
00:49:16,154 --> 00:49:18,615
You know who my-- You do?
He does!

913
00:49:18,615 --> 00:49:20,241
Oh, Gary, you're the best.

914
00:49:20,241 --> 00:49:21,367
It'll take some explaining,

915
00:49:21,367 --> 00:49:23,286
so follow me
and I'll tell you everything.

916
00:49:23,286 --> 00:49:25,038
Okay. Okay.

917
00:49:25,038 --> 00:49:26,206
W-W-Wait.

918
00:49:26,706 --> 00:49:28,625
Why do you wanna
help them all of a sudden?

919
00:49:28,625 --> 00:49:30,460
I'm a nice person.

920
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:31,711
Well, I'm coming, too.

921
00:49:31,711 --> 00:49:32,794
No, no, no, no, honey.

922
00:49:32,794 --> 00:49:34,713
You've had enough excitement
for one day. We gotta go home.

923
00:49:34,713 --> 00:49:37,049
Yes, Mel,
I think it's past your bedtime.

924
00:49:37,049 --> 00:49:38,258
What a wonderful boy.

925
00:49:38,258 --> 00:49:39,343
Thank you.

926
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:43,305
He could use
a father figure, perhaps.

927
00:49:44,473 --> 00:49:47,017
Um, okay.
Are you sure you're all right?

928
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:48,936
Terry, you've done
more than enough.

929
00:49:48,936 --> 00:49:50,479
Let Gary carry this burden.

930
00:49:50,479 --> 00:49:52,397
I know exactly what to do.

931
00:49:53,232 --> 00:49:54,650
He knows exactly what to do!

932
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:56,944
Ready?

933
00:49:58,195 --> 00:49:59,696
When someone
tells a story,

934
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:01,240
they create a whole world.

935
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,493
And usually, the characters
stay there in that world.

936
00:50:04,493 --> 00:50:07,246
What... What are you...
What are you talking about?

937
00:50:07,829 --> 00:50:12,793
{\an8}This is the world
that you come from.

938
00:50:19,591 --> 00:50:22,094
Moose, that's us.
That's me, that's you.

939
00:50:22,094 --> 00:50:24,096
Oh, this is incredible.

940
00:50:24,972 --> 00:50:26,390
It's a whole book about us.

941
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:28,849
Do you know
what brought you two to life?

942
00:50:29,517 --> 00:50:31,644
It's what your crayon
is made of.

943
00:50:31,644 --> 00:50:36,232
The most mysterious, powerful,
extraordinary stuff on earth.

944
00:50:36,941 --> 00:50:37,942
Wax.

945
00:50:37,942 --> 00:50:40,027
Pure imagination.

946
00:50:42,113 --> 00:50:44,031
Oh, that is so cool.

947
00:50:45,241 --> 00:50:47,577
I wanna go home. I miss home.
You know somethin'?

948
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:49,370
I'm goin' in.

949
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:50,454
That's...

950
00:50:50,454 --> 00:50:52,331
Let me in, book.
I wanna go home!

951
00:50:53,416 --> 00:50:54,709
I gotta step in it, maybe.

952
00:50:54,709 --> 00:50:55,877
That's not gonna work.

953
00:50:55,877 --> 00:50:58,087
And that's a $12 fine.

954
00:50:58,087 --> 00:50:59,630
Soiling.

955
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:05,052
"By Crockett Johnson."
The Narrator, Crockett Johnson!

956
00:51:05,052 --> 00:51:06,470
This is my old man.

957
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:08,097
Moose, we finally
know who it is!

958
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,022
Porcupine?

959
00:51:16,022 --> 00:51:17,607
Porcupine, is that you?

960
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:18,774
Harold?

961
00:51:18,774 --> 00:51:20,401
Yes! Harold!

962
00:51:20,401 --> 00:51:22,612
I knew it! I knew I'd find you!

963
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:24,780
Oh, my goodness!

964
00:51:26,156 --> 00:51:27,157
- Moose?
-Yeah!

965
00:51:27,157 --> 00:51:28,617
Porcupine, it's you?

966
00:51:28,617 --> 00:51:31,161
Look at you. You in human form.

967
00:51:31,161 --> 00:51:33,455
I know,
it's so weird!

968
00:51:33,455 --> 00:51:34,998
I love having these.

969
00:51:34,998 --> 00:51:37,459
I'm not really comfortable yet.
I miss my hooves, you know?

970
00:51:37,459 --> 00:51:39,169
Yeah, no, I miss my quills.

971
00:51:39,169 --> 00:51:41,213
It's so good having
the gang back together again.

972
00:51:41,213 --> 00:51:42,380
I know!

973
00:51:44,257 --> 00:51:46,718
You are under arrest
for breaking and entering!

974
00:51:46,718 --> 00:51:47,802
Is there a problem here?

975
00:51:47,802 --> 00:51:49,638
That porcupine
is a friend of ours.

976
00:51:55,101 --> 00:51:57,812
Uh, would it be possible
for me to get my crayon back?

977
00:51:59,314 --> 00:52:01,066
Tell y'all somethin',
moose do not belong in jail.

978
00:52:01,066 --> 00:52:03,693
I really don't like
the Real World at all.

979
00:52:03,693 --> 00:52:05,111
I just wanna go home so bad.

980
00:52:05,111 --> 00:52:07,656
Moose, relax. We can fix this.
We just need a plan.

981
00:52:07,656 --> 00:52:10,242
Whatever the plan is, can you
not leave me behind this time?

982
00:52:10,242 --> 00:52:13,078
No, of course not.
Hey, hey. Come here, come here.

983
00:52:13,078 --> 00:52:15,997
It's Harold and Moose
and Porcupine, okay?

984
00:52:15,997 --> 00:52:18,917
We're gonna figure out how to
get our world back together.

985
00:52:18,917 --> 00:52:21,585
We just gotta
get that crayon first.

986
00:52:32,304 --> 00:52:33,681
How do you do?

987
00:52:36,767 --> 00:52:40,354
You cannot keep me up in here!
Keep me locked up in here!

988
00:52:40,354 --> 00:52:41,647
Do you know what I am?

989
00:52:41,647 --> 00:52:42,982
You better get down!

990
00:52:42,982 --> 00:52:44,441
{\an8}You're so lucky

991
00:52:44,441 --> 00:52:46,110
you don't have a face
full of quills

992
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:47,152
- right now!
- I'm crazy, too.

993
00:52:55,369 --> 00:52:57,204
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Whoa, whoa...

994
00:53:03,252 --> 00:53:06,505
Come on, come on! Let me in!
Open up! Let me in!

995
00:53:06,505 --> 00:53:08,674
Come on, Moose!
Come on, hurry, hurry!

996
00:53:10,301 --> 00:53:11,594
You left the door open?

997
00:53:14,972 --> 00:53:17,932
Okay. How do we
get through that wall? Ooh.

998
00:53:19,851 --> 00:53:22,812
Yeah!
I can't believe that worked!

999
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:30,695
I need to get some crayons.

1000
00:53:33,781 --> 00:53:34,991
Okay, class.

1001
00:53:34,991 --> 00:53:36,910
Time is up. Pencils down.

1002
00:53:44,918 --> 00:53:46,586
Can I go to the bathroom?

1003
00:53:50,215 --> 00:53:53,092
- Hey.
- Hey! Give it back.

1004
00:53:53,092 --> 00:53:55,470
Why? Is your pet dragon
gonna hurt me?

1005
00:53:56,471 --> 00:53:58,389
This isn't funny. Give it back.

1006
00:53:58,389 --> 00:54:00,391
See ya later.

1007
00:54:00,391 --> 00:54:01,976
No, no, no!

1008
00:54:02,977 --> 00:54:04,437
Come on, let me out.

1009
00:54:04,938 --> 00:54:07,190
Ah...

1010
00:54:15,656 --> 00:54:17,533
Look, check out
this stupid whistle.

1011
00:54:17,533 --> 00:54:19,576
It doesn't even work.

1012
00:54:29,211 --> 00:54:32,047
Let's get out of here!

1013
00:54:49,231 --> 00:54:51,024
Mel, what did you do?

1014
00:54:54,444 --> 00:54:55,737
Sorry, Ms. Hemm.

1015
00:54:57,990 --> 00:54:59,283
Thanks, Carl.

1016
00:55:00,284 --> 00:55:01,910
Don't let anybody see you, okay?

1017
00:55:07,708 --> 00:55:09,960
That's cool.

1018
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,837
-Mel! Hey!
-Ha-ha!

1019
00:55:12,837 --> 00:55:14,088
Harold, Moose!

1020
00:55:14,088 --> 00:55:15,631
And Porcupine. Nice to meet you.

1021
00:55:15,631 --> 00:55:17,174
Hi, Porcupine.

1022
00:55:17,675 --> 00:55:19,176
Did you find your dad?

1023
00:55:19,176 --> 00:55:20,553
Yes! His name
is Crockett Johnson.

1024
00:55:20,553 --> 00:55:21,762
- Johnson.
-Gary was helping us.

1025
00:55:21,762 --> 00:55:23,598
Then we all got arrested, which
is a story for another time.

1026
00:55:23,598 --> 00:55:24,682
Found him.

1027
00:55:24,682 --> 00:55:27,101
His house is only like
20 minutes away from here.

1028
00:55:27,101 --> 00:55:29,645
Oh, that's perfect! Let's get
out of here. Come on, Mel.

1029
00:55:29,645 --> 00:55:32,106
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I have thumbs now. I drive.

1030
00:55:34,483 --> 00:55:36,736
Um, have you ever
driven a motorcycle before?

1031
00:55:36,736 --> 00:55:39,363
I'm a porcupine.
I've never done anything before.

1032
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:49,707
Slow down, Porcupine!

1033
00:56:01,844 --> 00:56:04,138
Can you believe
I've never done this before?

1034
00:56:04,138 --> 00:56:05,598
Yes, I can.

1035
00:56:05,598 --> 00:56:07,432
Look at the road.
Look at the road.

1036
00:56:33,792 --> 00:56:35,335
<i>Shaknathar!</i>

1037
00:56:35,335 --> 00:56:38,171
Well, what do you mean
he ran away?

1038
00:56:38,171 --> 00:56:40,006
Okay. Thank you.

1039
00:57:15,416 --> 00:57:18,002
Hello. Welcome to
the Crockett Johnson House.

1040
00:57:18,002 --> 00:57:19,420
Are you fans of his work?

1041
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:22,673
Yeah. Yeah. You could say that.

1042
00:57:22,673 --> 00:57:24,425
We've traveled a long way
to get here.

1043
00:57:24,425 --> 00:57:26,302
And I just can't wait
to meet him face-to-face.

1044
00:57:26,302 --> 00:57:28,637
Oh, well, this is a museum now.

1045
00:57:28,637 --> 00:57:30,472
Crockett Johnson passed away.

1046
00:57:31,807 --> 00:57:33,309
Passed away?

1047
00:57:35,895 --> 00:57:38,105
He's not alive anymore, Harold.

1048
00:57:38,689 --> 00:57:39,857
It's like my dad.

1049
00:57:40,858 --> 00:57:42,818
I'd be more than happy
to give you a tour.

1050
00:57:42,818 --> 00:57:43,986
No, that's okay.

1051
00:57:45,279 --> 00:57:47,239
Thank you. Have a good day.

1052
00:57:47,239 --> 00:57:48,699
Thanks. You, too.

1053
00:57:51,994 --> 00:57:53,120
I'm sorry, Harold.

1054
00:57:56,749 --> 00:57:58,709
That's the end of the story.

1055
00:58:05,757 --> 00:58:07,342
Mel! Mel!

1056
00:58:07,342 --> 00:58:08,718
Come here.

1057
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:11,262
What happened? Are you okay?
I was so worried.

1058
00:58:11,262 --> 00:58:12,889
The principal called and said
you trashed the school

1059
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:14,182
and you ran away?

1060
00:58:14,182 --> 00:58:15,600
No, it wasn't me. It was Carl.

1061
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,477
What is going on with you?

1062
00:58:17,477 --> 00:58:19,103
We found out that Harold
is from a book,

1063
00:58:19,103 --> 00:58:20,897
so we came here to find his dad.

1064
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:22,649
Mel, go wait in the car.

1065
00:58:22,649 --> 00:58:24,651
- But, Mom, Harold was--
- Just go!

1066
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:28,821
Go.

1067
00:58:32,158 --> 00:58:34,244
Look, I don't know
what's going on here,

1068
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:35,995
or whether you're just crazy.

1069
00:58:35,995 --> 00:58:37,330
But ever since you showed up,

1070
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:39,207
our lives have been
turned upside down.

1071
00:58:39,207 --> 00:58:40,917
I have a kid to protect.

1072
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:42,252
And you're filling his head
with stuff

1073
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:43,628
that's not good for him.

1074
00:58:43,628 --> 00:58:46,965
So, I'm gonna have to ask you
to stay away from me and my son.

1075
00:58:46,965 --> 00:58:48,299
Just leave us alone.

1076
00:58:54,806 --> 00:58:55,931
I'm sorry.

1077
00:58:58,350 --> 00:59:00,811
I was wrong about everything.

1078
00:59:09,945 --> 00:59:11,154
Porcupine?

1079
00:59:13,115 --> 00:59:15,742
It's disappeared.

1080
00:59:16,243 --> 00:59:17,536
- Harold.
- What do we do?

1081
00:59:17,536 --> 00:59:18,745
It's over.

1082
00:59:19,454 --> 00:59:21,164
What do you mean it's over?
You can do anything.

1083
00:59:21,164 --> 00:59:22,374
No, I can't.

1084
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,251
It was the old man.

1085
00:59:24,251 --> 00:59:26,003
It was his book.
It was his world.

1086
00:59:26,003 --> 00:59:29,298
I'm just a dumb drawing
drawing other dumb drawings.

1087
00:59:30,632 --> 00:59:32,050
So is that what we are?

1088
00:59:32,885 --> 00:59:34,469
Just some dumb drawings?

1089
00:59:35,554 --> 00:59:36,763
I'm sorry.

1090
00:59:44,104 --> 00:59:45,189
Moose?

1091
00:59:47,107 --> 00:59:48,275
Porcupine?

1092
00:59:50,485 --> 00:59:51,570
No.

1093
00:59:54,363 --> 00:59:55,364
No.

1094
01:00:38,699 --> 01:00:40,076
Oh, Old Man.

1095
01:00:42,537 --> 01:00:44,914
You never should have
given me this.

1096
01:01:18,488 --> 01:01:19,489
Harold.

1097
01:01:22,158 --> 01:01:24,077
How are you doing, my friend?

1098
01:01:35,046 --> 01:01:36,047
Mom?

1099
01:01:36,923 --> 01:01:39,092
I've got a bad feeling.
I think Harold's in trouble.

1100
01:01:39,092 --> 01:01:41,303
No, the only one
who's in trouble is you.

1101
01:01:41,303 --> 01:01:43,680
And I don't want to hear
any more about Harold.

1102
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:44,763
Get in the car.

1103
01:01:54,148 --> 01:01:57,276
Mom! Mom, everything Harold drew
is disappearing.

1104
01:01:57,276 --> 01:01:59,612
I'm serious, Mom.
Something's wrong.

1105
01:01:59,612 --> 01:02:02,406
I don't trust Gary.
He's up to something.

1106
01:02:02,406 --> 01:02:04,325
We gotta help. And I need Carl.

1107
01:02:04,325 --> 01:02:05,951
- Give me the whistle.
- Mom.

1108
01:02:05,951 --> 01:02:07,328
Give it to me.

1109
01:02:22,259 --> 01:02:23,677
You've let everyone down.

1110
01:02:23,677 --> 01:02:25,804
But without anyone to guide you,

1111
01:02:25,804 --> 01:02:28,057
you were bound
to mess things up.

1112
01:02:29,516 --> 01:02:32,520
You can't use the crayon all
by yourself. It's too powerful.

1113
01:02:33,103 --> 01:02:35,231
Let me guide your story.

1114
01:02:35,231 --> 01:02:37,942
My stuff's a little darker.
It's for ages 14 and up.

1115
01:02:37,942 --> 01:02:39,735
But I can do it.

1116
01:02:40,528 --> 01:02:43,238
Harold, I can help you.

1117
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,616
Give me the crayon.

1118
01:03:26,447 --> 01:03:28,658
I'm a creative person.

1119
01:03:28,658 --> 01:03:30,702
I create worlds.

1120
01:03:30,702 --> 01:03:34,080
If you'd read my book,
you would know that this...

1121
01:03:34,873 --> 01:03:36,499
is the Dungeon of Azgarach.

1122
01:03:39,251 --> 01:03:43,714
Oh! These are strange,
cool bracelets.

1123
01:03:43,714 --> 01:03:46,091
Well, I'm glad you like them.

1124
01:03:47,384 --> 01:03:49,344
You're going to be wearing them
for a very long time.

1125
01:03:56,727 --> 01:03:58,520
All of the people
who rejected me,

1126
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:00,772
I'll show them
how wrong they were.

1127
01:04:01,607 --> 01:04:04,943
Now they'll see
what Library Gary is capable of.

1128
01:04:04,943 --> 01:04:06,862
No, Gary, that's not
what the crayon is for.

1129
01:04:06,862 --> 01:04:09,031
You're supposed to use it
to make people happy.

1130
01:04:09,031 --> 01:04:11,283
Revenge will make me happy.

1131
01:04:23,503 --> 01:04:24,504
Harold? Ah!

1132
01:04:26,381 --> 01:04:28,175
Gary, leave him alone.
Let him go.

1133
01:04:28,175 --> 01:04:30,344
I really feel like I've gone
too far down this path

1134
01:04:30,344 --> 01:04:31,511
to turn back now.

1135
01:04:31,511 --> 01:04:33,596
I know Terry
is going to be distraught

1136
01:04:33,596 --> 01:04:35,348
about her missing son,
of course,

1137
01:04:35,348 --> 01:04:37,183
but don't worry.

1138
01:04:37,183 --> 01:04:39,769
Library Gary will comfort her.

1139
01:04:40,478 --> 01:04:42,897
Maybe someday
I'll even draw her a new son.

1140
01:04:42,897 --> 01:04:44,857
A cool one that looks like me.

1141
01:04:44,857 --> 01:04:47,360
You're a seriously
messed-up guy, Gary.

1142
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:48,945
Oh, yeah? How about this?

1143
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:52,573
How about what? How about what?

1144
01:05:08,673 --> 01:05:11,425
Oh, no. The Real World
is nothing like I imagined it.

1145
01:05:14,595 --> 01:05:15,596
No.

1146
01:05:21,853 --> 01:05:22,854
Mel?

1147
01:05:24,438 --> 01:05:25,731
Can we talk?

1148
01:05:28,526 --> 01:05:29,569
Mel--

1149
01:05:30,151 --> 01:05:31,152
Mel?

1150
01:05:36,449 --> 01:05:38,577
Now the world will gaze upon me

1151
01:05:39,619 --> 01:05:41,121
and be impressed.

1152
01:05:41,913 --> 01:05:44,416
Onward, Thrahaknahar!

1153
01:05:53,675 --> 01:05:55,343
I'm so sorry, Mel.

1154
01:05:57,137 --> 01:05:58,763
I can't draw us out of this one.

1155
01:05:58,763 --> 01:06:00,432
I really messed up.

1156
01:06:01,349 --> 01:06:05,228
No, you didn't.
You made things a lot better.

1157
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:08,523
You believed in me.

1158
01:06:09,858 --> 01:06:11,359
And my mom.

1159
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:12,527
And Carl.

1160
01:06:15,822 --> 01:06:17,532
Just believe in yourself.

1161
01:06:18,533 --> 01:06:20,076
I do.

1162
01:06:24,664 --> 01:06:26,624
And we <i>can</i> draw
our way out of here.

1163
01:07:06,747 --> 01:07:07,998
Hey! Hey!

1164
01:07:07,998 --> 01:07:10,626
Hyah!

1165
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:12,253
Let's go get him.

1166
01:07:18,092 --> 01:07:19,552
Hyah!

1167
01:07:19,552 --> 01:07:23,137
Upon this rock
I shall erect my kingdom.

1168
01:07:36,526 --> 01:07:38,736
That was fun, right?
Go hide, go hide.

1169
01:07:40,405 --> 01:07:41,531
How did you get out?

1170
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:43,908
With this.

1171
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,371
Mine's bigger.

1172
01:07:48,371 --> 01:07:52,083
Look, Gary, it doesn't belong
to you, okay? Give it back.

1173
01:07:52,083 --> 01:07:54,586
Mm. Sorry.
I can't do that, Harold.

1174
01:08:25,324 --> 01:08:26,325
Draw.

1175
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:34,958
Huh?

1176
01:08:42,423 --> 01:08:44,258
Yay for Harold!

1177
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:13,872
Ow.

1178
01:09:23,881 --> 01:09:25,757
Fire!

1179
01:09:25,757 --> 01:09:27,092
Harold, look out!

1180
01:09:36,769 --> 01:09:38,145
Oh! Oh!

1181
01:09:43,985 --> 01:09:45,778
You'll have to do
better than that.

1182
01:09:51,409 --> 01:09:52,493
That was better.

1183
01:09:56,163 --> 01:09:58,457
No! No! No.

1184
01:09:58,457 --> 01:09:59,584
No. No.

1185
01:09:59,584 --> 01:10:00,918
-Give me the crayon.
-No.

1186
01:10:00,918 --> 01:10:02,545
- Yes.
- Never!

1187
01:10:02,545 --> 01:10:04,380
Gary! No, no...

1188
01:10:06,007 --> 01:10:07,049
Mm-mm.

1189
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:12,179
Gary! Everyone knows
you don't eat crayons.

1190
01:10:12,762 --> 01:10:14,014
Not good.

1191
01:10:22,898 --> 01:10:24,274
The power.

1192
01:10:25,650 --> 01:10:26,776
I feel it.

1193
01:10:45,128 --> 01:10:46,796
Where is he?

1194
01:10:46,796 --> 01:10:48,048
Gary, where are you?

1195
01:10:48,632 --> 01:10:50,300
There is no Gary.

1196
01:10:55,138 --> 01:10:57,390
Only G'Garaur.

1197
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:02,354
Mel! Oh, my God. Are you okay?

1198
01:11:02,354 --> 01:11:04,689
I was so worried.
What is happening here?

1199
01:11:04,689 --> 01:11:06,525
Mom, Gary swallowed the crayon.

1200
01:11:06,525 --> 01:11:07,816
I think he's
trying to kill Harold.

1201
01:11:12,279 --> 01:11:14,031
- We have to get out of here.
-Yeah.

1202
01:11:14,031 --> 01:11:15,950
Terry, don't go.

1203
01:11:15,950 --> 01:11:17,701
Come. Join me.

1204
01:11:17,701 --> 01:11:20,204
So that we may
rule over this land.

1205
01:11:20,204 --> 01:11:23,207
Man and woman.

1206
01:11:24,166 --> 01:11:26,335
- No thank you.
- Really?

1207
01:11:26,335 --> 01:11:28,879
Yup. No.
I do like your new hair though.

1208
01:11:33,342 --> 01:11:35,344
I'll show you
what you're missing.

1209
01:11:44,270 --> 01:11:45,646
The glaive...

1210
01:11:47,106 --> 01:11:48,983
of G'Garaur!

1211
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,444
Run!

1212
01:11:56,657 --> 01:11:57,741
Watch out!

1213
01:12:05,164 --> 01:12:06,165
Harold!

1214
01:12:08,501 --> 01:12:09,586
Watch out!

1215
01:12:13,965 --> 01:12:15,300
Harold!

1216
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:16,593
Oh, no!

1217
01:12:21,181 --> 01:12:24,851
Hey. I should have believed you
a long time ago.

1218
01:12:31,482 --> 01:12:34,903
You see, Harold,
this power was meant for me.

1219
01:12:48,041 --> 01:12:49,918
Sic him, Carl!

1220
01:13:00,636 --> 01:13:03,096
Oh. Not the hair.

1221
01:13:03,096 --> 01:13:06,225
That is the only thing
she likes about me.

1222
01:13:15,484 --> 01:13:16,944
Carl!

1223
01:13:18,445 --> 01:13:20,030
No!

1224
01:13:20,030 --> 01:13:21,490
No, Gary. You have to stop this.

1225
01:13:21,490 --> 01:13:23,325
This isn't
what the crayon is for.

1226
01:13:25,619 --> 01:13:27,120
G'Garaur!

1227
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:32,876
It's over, Harold.

1228
01:13:32,876 --> 01:13:37,214
You're just a cartoon drawing
from the young reader section

1229
01:13:37,214 --> 01:13:40,384
with no narrator
to tell you what to do

1230
01:13:40,384 --> 01:13:42,302
and no friends to help you.

1231
01:13:47,307 --> 01:13:49,059
Well, I believe in me.

1232
01:13:49,685 --> 01:13:51,353
And I believe in my friends.

1233
01:13:51,353 --> 01:13:53,105
Friends are overrated.

1234
01:13:53,897 --> 01:13:55,190
So I've been told.

1235
01:14:04,490 --> 01:14:06,117
- Do you need a hand?
- Yes!

1236
01:14:06,117 --> 01:14:08,661
I've lost the crayon.
We have to get it back.

1237
01:14:08,661 --> 01:14:12,623
Oh, look, the whole
storybook back together again.

1238
01:14:12,623 --> 01:14:14,083
How touching.

1239
01:14:15,543 --> 01:14:17,211
I've got this.

1240
01:14:19,964 --> 01:14:21,799
<i>Thraknah!</i>

1241
01:14:22,717 --> 01:14:23,801
Ha!

1242
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:26,095
Yes!

1243
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:31,851
I will not give up
this power, Harold.

1244
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:38,608
I hate to do this to you, Gary,
but you left me no choice.

1245
01:14:38,608 --> 01:14:40,526
Nothing you can draw
will be beat me.

1246
01:14:41,485 --> 01:14:43,196
Spiderfly.

1247
01:14:53,622 --> 01:14:55,081
The glaive!

1248
01:14:55,081 --> 01:14:56,041
Ah!

1249
01:14:58,084 --> 01:14:59,586
Well, Moose, you're up.

1250
01:15:00,295 --> 01:15:01,338
What?

1251
01:15:22,108 --> 01:15:23,151
Oh.

1252
01:15:42,796 --> 01:15:43,880
We did it!

1253
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:45,423
- Come on!
- Yes!

1254
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:49,052
Carl!

1255
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:00,813
You okay?

1256
01:16:05,025 --> 01:16:07,903
I just wanted a place
where I belonged.

1257
01:16:10,990 --> 01:16:12,950
I wanted my world

1258
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:15,244
to be real.

1259
01:16:49,485 --> 01:16:50,612
It's beautiful.

1260
01:16:51,196 --> 01:16:53,531
Why does that woman
look like me?

1261
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:57,452
Does she?

1262
01:17:00,288 --> 01:17:02,457
Uh, go, go, go.
You belong there...

1263
01:17:02,457 --> 01:17:03,958
G'Garaur.

1264
01:17:06,836 --> 01:17:08,296
You said it right.

1265
01:17:21,559 --> 01:17:23,102
Oh, and, Harold, I--

1266
01:17:24,646 --> 01:17:26,231
We should leave him in there.

1267
01:18:15,946 --> 01:18:17,155
Yeah.

1268
01:18:17,155 --> 01:18:19,491
Aw, your antlers!

1269
01:18:56,194 --> 01:18:57,570
I wonder what
the old man would say

1270
01:18:57,570 --> 01:18:58,779
if he could see me now.

1271
01:18:59,488 --> 01:19:01,866
I think he would
have been proud of you.

1272
01:19:04,285 --> 01:19:05,369
Thank you.

1273
01:19:06,704 --> 01:19:07,747
Oh.

1274
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:12,460
Did he ever say
why he made Harold?

1275
01:19:13,127 --> 01:19:14,420
Follow me.

1276
01:19:38,235 --> 01:19:39,402
<i>Dear Harold,</i>

1277
01:19:40,403 --> 01:19:43,907
<i>one day you might wanna know
why I made you.</i>

1278
01:19:43,907 --> 01:19:45,867
<i>In the beginning,
you were just a boy</i>

1279
01:19:45,867 --> 01:19:48,495
<i>with a purple crayon
and a blank page.</i>

1280
01:19:49,955 --> 01:19:53,250
<i>I wanted to show folks
that with a little imagination,</i>

1281
01:19:53,250 --> 01:19:56,670
<i>you can make your life
whatever you want it to be.</i>

1282
01:20:00,048 --> 01:20:02,008
<i>I wanted you to inspire people</i>

1283
01:20:02,008 --> 01:20:04,427
<i>to live their lives
that way, too.</i>

1284
01:20:07,514 --> 01:20:10,225
<i>We only have
so much time in this world,</i>

1285
01:20:10,225 --> 01:20:13,770
<i>but we leave our mark
in the lives we change.</i>

1286
01:20:15,856 --> 01:20:20,026
<i>And I know you, Harold,
will keep inspiring our world...</i>

1287
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:24,656
<i>one person at a time.</i>

1288
01:20:28,785 --> 01:20:32,121
<i>Because life isn't something
that just happens to you.</i>

1289
01:20:33,247 --> 01:20:34,415
Thank you.

1290
01:20:34,415 --> 01:20:36,375
<i>It's something you create.</i>

1291
01:20:38,294 --> 01:20:39,295
<i>The trick...</i>

1292
01:20:40,421 --> 01:20:42,131
<i>is in the imagining.</i>

1293
01:20:42,756 --> 01:20:43,841
I'll see you soon.

1294
01:20:53,142 --> 01:20:55,269
- All right, guys. Ready?
- Ready!

1295
01:20:55,269 --> 01:20:57,646
Moose? Moose, are you ready?

1296
01:20:57,646 --> 01:21:00,107
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm ready.

1297
01:21:00,107 --> 01:21:01,859
I was drawn ready.

1298
01:21:03,152 --> 01:21:04,278
Come on, everybody!

1299
01:23:01,602 --> 01:23:04,396
Music as sweet
as a phoenix song.

1300
01:23:18,285 --> 01:23:19,411
Zerry.

1301
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:20,995
O Warrior Queen.

1302
01:23:21,787 --> 01:23:23,372
I found you at last,

1303
01:23:23,372 --> 01:23:26,042
and nothing in the world
shall tear us asunder.

1304
01:23:26,042 --> 01:23:29,337
Oh, that's so flattering, Gar--

1305
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:31,339
- Gagur--
- G'Garaur.

1306
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:32,507
Gar-gar.

1307
01:23:33,007 --> 01:23:34,300
But I'm seeing someone.

1308
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:39,055
Gondaldemor?

1309
01:23:42,683 --> 01:23:43,976
Good morrow.

1310
01:23:45,978 --> 01:23:47,063
Well, that's cool.

1311
01:23:48,022 --> 01:23:49,899
I'm super busy anyway!
