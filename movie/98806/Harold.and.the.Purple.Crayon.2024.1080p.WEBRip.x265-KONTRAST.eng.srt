1
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:13,115
<i>Once there was a boy
named Harold,</i>

2
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:15,659
<i>who went on an adventure.</i>

3
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,579
<i>And he took
his purple crayon with him.</i>

4
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:19,955
Aha!

5
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:22,708
<i>He could draw
whatever he wanted.</i>

6
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:27,755
<i>And sometimes,
that got him in over his head.</i>

7
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:31,842
<i>But he always came up
thinking fast.</i>

8
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,138
<i>And it was on
to the next adventure.</i>

9
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:40,559
<i>He did what anyone
would do with a magic crayon.</i>

10
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:44,271
<i>He made some pies,
and then he made some friends.</i>

11
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,524
<i>He called them
Moose and Porcupine.</i>

12
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:47,817
Come on, everybody.

13
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:49,860
<i>For obvious reasons.</i>

14
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,281
Not again!

15
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,244
<i>They never left
each other's sides.</i>

16
00:01:58,244 --> 00:02:01,539
<i>Even when they got lost,
they always found each other.</i>

17
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:02,998
<i>No matter where they were,</i>

18
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:07,127
<i>Harold always remembered
where his bedroom window was.</i>

19
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,921
<i>Right around the moon.</i>

20
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:13,676
<i>Night, Harold.</i>

21
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:15,052
Good night.

22
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:19,765
<i>The end.</i>

23
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,183
<i>Good night, folks.</i>

24
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:24,228
<i>Just kidding! Of course
the story didn't end there.</i>

25
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,439
Come on, everybody!

26
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:30,234
I need to go down now!

27
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,403
<i>His world got bigger.</i>

28
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:35,531
<i>And so did his imagination.</i>

29
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:38,117
You got that right, Narrator!

30
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:40,327
My stomachs are sloshing around!

31
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,663
- Harold, look out!
- What?

32
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:44,915
Hey, everybody!

33
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,380
<i>And he still got in
over his head.</i>

34
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,801
<i>But he always came up
thinking fast.</i>

35
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,261
Little help here!

36
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:00,139
<i>Faster than that.</i>

37
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,142
<i>- Harold!</i>
- I got it!

38
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:05,227
Oh, hi!

39
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,062
<i>With his purple crayon,</i>

40
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,272
<i>anything was possible.</i>

41
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:09,648
Gotcha!

42
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:13,569
-<i>Oh, careful there.</i>
-Sorry, Moose.

43
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,240
Hmmph.

44
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,491
I've been thinking.

45
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,578
If I drew you guys,
then who drew me?

46
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:24,747
That's deep.

47
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:26,290
<i>I drew you, Harold.</i>

48
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,084
- You did?
-<i>Mm-hmm. I sure did.</i>

49
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,502
What do you look like?

50
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,338
<i>I used to look
a little like you.</i>

51
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:33,797
<i>But I'm an old man now.</i>

52
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,050
<i>I guess in a way
I'm your old man.</i>

53
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,635
My old man.

54
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,014
So then why can't I
see you, Old Man?

55
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:43,933
<i>Because
I'm someplace else.</i>

56
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:45,476
<i>The Real World.</i>

57
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:48,646
The Real World. Wow.

58
00:03:48,646 --> 00:03:49,730
What's that?

59
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,440
<i>Well,
it's kind of like your world</i>

60
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,733
<i>only a bit more colorful.</i>

61
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,360
<i>And a lot more complicated.</i>

62
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,071
Well, it sounds amazing.
Can I visit you someday?

63
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:58,989
<i>Oh,
I wish that was possible.</i>

64
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,700
But with the crayon
anything is possible, right?

65
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,202
<i>Good night, Harold.</i>

66
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:05,496
Wait, wait, wait, Old Man.
One more question.

67
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:07,706
- Why did you draw me?
-<i>Night, Harold.</i>

68
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,583
Okay, okay.

69
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,960
Good night, Old Man.

70
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,389
So, Old Man, I've been thinking

71
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:26,225
and I've got
a lot of follow-up questions.

72
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,811
Old Man?

73
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:31,063
You there?

74
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:34,024
Old Man. Hello!

75
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,068
Old Man!

76
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:42,199
Old Man!

77
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:45,577
All of a sudden
this guy goes quiet?

78
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:46,704
I don't think so.

79
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:48,414
This man loved to talk.

80
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:51,166
Maybe he's busy
being real in the Real World.

81
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,960
I'm deep.

82
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,963
That's it! Guys,
let's go to the Real World!

83
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,674
Oh, no, no, no.
We don't wanna do that.

84
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:03,846
With the crayon,
anything is possible.

85
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:06,306
That's not how it works, Harold.
You can't just--

86
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,187
Whoa!

87
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,731
Yeah! Let's go!

88
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:18,027
You heard the old man.
The Real World is constipated.

89
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:19,820
And who knows what that means.

90
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,865
Okay, fine. You two stay here
in case my old man comes back.

91
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:23,949
Great idea.

92
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,535
And I'm gonna go look for him
out there. Don't worry.

93
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,078
- I got this!
- Wait!

94
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:40,132
What is he wearing?

95
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,010
It's so bright.

96
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,262
It's so beautiful.

97
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,098
What are you doing?

98
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,642
It's very confusing.
I'm new here, but--

99
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:51,977
Oh, hello.

100
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,437
Very creative.

101
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:56,899
Near.

102
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:58,692
Far.

103
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,861
Near. Far. Three dimensions.

104
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,072
Oh, it's even cooler
than I imagined!

105
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:04,907
Look at all the friendly people!

106
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:07,868
- Oh, excuse me. Where are we?
- Get lost, Smurf.

107
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,788
- We're going after him, right?
- Mmh-mmh. Nope.

108
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:14,583
Aw, come on. Just a peek.

109
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,460
- All right, all right.
- Yes!

110
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,628
Just a peek.

111
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:22,091
What's it look like?

112
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:26,428
I can't tell. It's...
It's all mysterious and fuzzy.

113
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:30,140
Maybe you should look closer.

114
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,312
Aw, come on!

115
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:44,404
The Real World.

116
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,075
Why do my hooves feel so soft?

117
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:03,465
Hi!

118
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,135
What are we running from?

119
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:07,678
A grown man in a onesie.

120
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:12,683
Oh.

121
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:15,602
Real World clothes.

122
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:22,901
Different.

123
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,319
Leavin' me behind.

124
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,072
You're not gonna last one day.

125
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,407
Don't worry.

126
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:30,701
Porcupine's on the way.

127
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:31,869
Yes!

128
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:34,538
No thumbs!

129
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,166
That's not good.

130
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,172
It's him! Old Man!

131
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:45,591
Old Man! Old Man!

132
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:46,842
Harold?

133
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:49,887
Harold! Harold! It's me, Moose!

134
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,305
- Moose?
- Yes, yes.

135
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,515
Oh, hi.

136
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,809
Hi, buddy!
You look so different.

137
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,520
- I look strange, right?
- No, no, you look really cool.

138
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,147
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yeah.

139
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,149
Okay, this Real World thing
is real.

140
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,775
It's really real.
And guess what.

141
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,153
It's only getting better,
because we found him.

142
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,155
The old man. He's right here.

143
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,740
Let's go!

144
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,367
Old Man! It's Harold! Finally!
Ow!

145
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,869
Hey! Get away from me!

146
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:15,537
Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

147
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:16,955
Why would you do that?

148
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,208
Uh, Harold, maybe we
got the wrong guy.

149
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,584
You're probably right,
Moose.

150
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:23,503
Have a good day, Not Old Man!

151
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,297
The Real World is huge.

152
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27,633
There has to be at least
10 to 20 old men here.

153
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,509
Yeah. We got a lot
of ground to cover.

154
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,990
Real world, here I come!

155
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,015
Thumbs!

156
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,434
Yes! Yes.

157
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:23,355
Whoa.
Look at these legs!

158
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:25,691
Whoa.

159
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,068
Ah. Aah.

160
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,158
Look out, world.

161
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:36,827
I'm big.

162
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,497
Hi. I'm Porcupine.

163
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:41,832
I'm a bunny.

164
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,542
No way.

165
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:46,753
Hi!

166
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:53,010
-Get off the road!
- Nice day for a ride!

167
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,594
<i>Hey, Prasad.</i>

168
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,556
I know,
I won't miss another sh--

169
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,850
I won't miss another shift.
I just--

170
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:02,185
Come on, Prasad.

171
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,855
I had to take my kid
to a school thing.

172
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:08,066
She should not be
using her phone while driving.

173
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:11,862
- Uh, Harold?
- Yeah?

174
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,572
I don't think
we're doing this right!

175
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:15,574
- Okay.
- Look out!

176
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:17,784
Excuse us! Excuse us!

177
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,495
-Prasad. Hold on.
- Mom!

178
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,004
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

179
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:33,633
Oh...

180
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,804
You okay, Carl?
It's okay, buddy.

181
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,973
Felt like my old self
for a second.

182
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,850
I don't know
if it was a fear thing.

183
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,977
Oh, my God! Are you okay?
I'm so sorry!

184
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,437
I didn't see you there.

185
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:49,024
I thought I saw a moose.
Did you guys see a moose?

186
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,150
Yeah. I'm a moose.

187
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,985
I think you have a concussion.

188
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,071
My insides are coming out
my outsides!

189
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:55,405
I'm gonna
get you a Band-Aid.

190
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,782
I think I have one in my purse.

191
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,410
Oh... Oh, shoot.

192
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,413
I got a flat tire. Sorry,
one sec. Just hang on. Um...

193
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,082
Hang on one sec.

194
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,460
Hi. Yeah, I'm gonna need a tire.

195
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,670
I have a flat and no spare.

196
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,881
Yeah, I'll hold. Thank you.

197
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,350
- How did you do that?
- Shh!

198
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,434
Hi, I'm--

199
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,273
Wow, you are really
good at that.

200
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,442
She's not actually
changing a tire.

201
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,569
She's just attaching it
onto the car.

202
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:37,906
- That's how you change a tire.
- That's how you change a tire.

203
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:41,827
What's that?

204
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,955
Oh, it's...
It's my whistle for Carl.

205
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:47,582
Ahh!

206
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:48,875
Wow, that was loud!

207
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,044
Uh, who's Carl?

208
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,838
He's my Dragolizagator.

209
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:54,089
- He's right there.
-Huh?

210
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:57,759
Is he really small?

211
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,928
He's got amazing
camouflage abilities.

212
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:00,846
Oh.

213
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:04,224
He's part eagle,
lion, alligator.

214
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,768
You know what, kiddo?
Let's not do Carl today, okay?

215
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,896
Well, he's licking me,

216
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,314
which is a little ticklish.

217
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,525
Oh, that tickles!
But he's lick--

218
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,068
Oh, it tickles! Oh, it tickles!

219
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,237
- He's going after you.
- He's going after you, Moose!

220
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,613
Don't worry.
He's just trying to sniff you

221
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:19,698
to see if you're friendly.

222
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:22,117
I'm a moose. Get your sniff on.

223
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:26,496
By the way,
I'm Terry and this is Mel.

224
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,457
Hi, I'm Harold.

225
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:29,749
Moose again.

226
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,293
I'm so sorry for everything.

227
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:32,794
Can I give you guys
a ride somewhere?

228
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,337
It's the least I can do.

229
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,589
Sure.

230
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,600
Old Man!

231
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,726
No! Stop!

232
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:49,102
Hi!

233
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,229
My goodness.
What is it with you people?

234
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,856
It's me, Porcupine.

235
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,983
If you don't want any trouble,
you better get out of here.

236
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,818
What are you doing?

237
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,947
Aw. No quills.

238
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,741
This really
is a brand-new world.

239
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:11,875
I'm glad you guys are okay.

240
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,836
And that you're not litigious.

241
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:18,089
Sorry about hitting you
back there.

242
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,674
Uh, where can I drop you off?

243
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:22,135
Uh, well, the old man's house
would be great.

244
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,803
You mean your dad?

245
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:28,016
Yeah. I mean,
I guess you could call him that.

246
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:28,934
If it weren't for him,

247
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:31,061
I wouldn't exist, so...

248
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:32,187
Where does he live?

249
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,607
Well, we were hoping
that you would know.

250
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,609
- Where your dad lives?
- Yes.

251
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:40,570
Uh, no, I do not know that.

252
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,156
But I'm happy to drop you
at a bus station

253
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,866
or wherever
you're staying tonight.

254
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,326
Well, we don't exactly know

255
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,537
where we're gonna stay
tonight just yet.

256
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:51,623
Yeah. And you're the only people
we actually know, so...

257
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,208
They can stay with us.

258
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,709
New friends! Yay!

259
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:57,170
Oh, gosh, that would be so fun.

260
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,922
But we don't have a room.

261
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:01,216
Yeah, we do, Mom.
Above the garage.

262
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:03,009
No, Mel,
they're not staying with us.

263
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,012
I'm sorry, we just don't
know you, really, at all.

264
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,472
Mom, we can't just abandon them.

265
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:08,890
You hit them,
you broke their bike.

266
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,559
And they don't
have anywhere to stay.

267
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:14,104
Dad always said,
"When people need help..."

268
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:16,314
"We help."

269
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,733
Yeah. Yeah, we do say that.

270
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,404
Okay, fine.

271
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:24,239
One night. Above the garage.

272
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:26,408
Yes!

273
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:27,617
Wow, that's a lot of emphasis

274
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:28,910
- on "Above the garage."
- Yeah.

275
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,453
Just don't get
too excited, okay?

276
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,916
That's what people
say when it's really exciting.

277
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:37,669
Above the garage!

278
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:41,339
Above the garage!
Above the garage!

279
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,674
Is this your house?

280
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:44,134
Ooh, nice!

281
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,263
Home sweet home.

282
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:51,975
Could use a new coat of paint
and a new roof,

283
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:54,102
and a lot of other things.

284
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,354
I think it looks great.

285
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,733
Here's the palace.

286
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,695
Oh, Terry, this is amazing!

287
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:06,156
Do you see this?
She has a wall bed.

288
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:07,824
This is so classy.

289
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,493
How did you know
I sleep standin' up?

290
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:11,578
Oh, you know what,

291
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,788
I never got around to donating
any of these clothes,

292
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,665
so please help yourself
to anything that fits you.

293
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,042
What's this music?

294
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:21,296
Oh, that would be nothing.
Just junk from my old life.

295
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:23,548
You're a musician.

296
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,216
Yeah, I was.

297
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,593
I just, you know...

298
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,055
When you're young,
you have all kinds of dreams,

299
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:32,974
and then the world
just kicks it out of you.

300
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,351
I've never been kicked before,

301
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:36,686
but I was hit by a guy
with a cane.

302
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:38,396
So I hear ya.

303
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:41,608
Now I stock shelves
at Ollie's.

304
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,319
You know, uh,

305
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:45,403
Ollie's?

306
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,073
It's like a store
that sells everything.

307
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,783
You work at a store
that sells everything?

308
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,242
That sounds like
the best job ever.

309
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,828
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Ollie's is the best job ever.

310
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:54,954
Yes, it is.

311
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,624
Kudos. Good thing
you don't do music anymore,

312
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:00,335
you wouldn't have an amazing job
like Ollie's!

313
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:01,544
Yeah.

314
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:02,629
I hate my job.

315
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,756
Um, anyway, what do you guys do?

316
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:07,175
Well, I draw.

317
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:09,260
- Hmm. An artist.
- Yeah.

318
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:11,846
Um...

319
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:14,391
What do you do?

320
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,184
Besides that?

321
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,520
I basically
just follow him around

322
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,813
in a moose-like fashion.

323
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,774
Every day.

324
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:25,944
Okay. Well, um...

325
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,154
I'm gonna triple lock the door,

326
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:31,032
just, you know,
to keep any weirdos out.

327
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:33,827
You guys can hit the road
in the morning. 'Kay?

328
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,078
Enjoy.

329
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,455
- Thank you, Terry.
- Mm-hmm.

330
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,419
Moose, we are so lucky.

331
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:44,170
Look at all this!

332
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,797
Are we lucky, Harold?

333
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:48,216
I don't think we belong
here in the Real World.

334
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:51,136
You know, with all the pain.
It's just all so different.

335
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:53,513
Well, of course
it's different, buddy.

336
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,681
It's a different world.

337
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,933
It's the Real World.
It's an adventure.

338
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,060
That's kind of fun, right?

339
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,895
Hey, look.
We'll find the old man,

340
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,355
he'll start narrating again,

341
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,357
and then everything
will go back to normal.

342
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,443
- Then we go home?
- Yeah.

343
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,948
He made a bicycle with a crayon.

344
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,284
Then she says she's a porcupine.

345
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:15,410
"Porcupine."

346
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,412
Well, you did the right thing
by calling us.

347
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,080
We're gonna put together
a special task force,

348
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,541
and, uh, we'll definitely
keep you updated.

349
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,793
- Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.
-Yes, sir. Thank you.

350
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,670
First thing
you learn in this job,

351
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:28,423
gotta humor the crazies.

352
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:50,987
Old Man.

353
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,002
That's Pandaconda.

354
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,504
- Half panda, half snake.
- Mm.

355
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:11,132
And this one's half platypus,
half possum.

356
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:13,092
A Platypossum. Genius.

357
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,886
Because a platypus

358
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:17,931
is basically already an animal
mashup anyway. So, you know...

359
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:20,517
You get more bang for your buck.
Thank you.

360
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:21,768
Yeah.

361
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,187
This one's Carl.

362
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:26,272
Well, you captured
him perfectly.

363
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,066
I handed that one in
for art class,

364
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:29,400
and I got an "unsatisfactory."

365
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,277
Clearly some people
have no vision.

366
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,614
I really wanted a dog
but I'm allergic,

367
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,449
so Dad got me Carl.

368
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,369
And we used to play
with him all the time. Mom too.

369
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:43,623
But that was before my dad died.

370
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:45,834
Oh.

371
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,254
And, um, by "died" you mean...

372
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:52,507
Stopped living.

373
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,886
Oh, right, right. Right.

374
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,681
Now Mom's always stressed out

375
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:01,808
and I wish...

376
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,726
You wish what?

377
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,106
I don't know, I just want her
to be happy, you know?

378
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,316
Like she used to be.

379
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,151
Well, maybe I can help.

380
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,654
Maybe we could help each other.

381
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:16,614
Yeah, like,
you make my mom happy,

382
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,157
and I'll help you find your dad.

383
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:20,702
Deal.

384
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,412
Oh.

385
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:23,913
What? Oh.

386
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:31,462
So how did you make that tire?
I really gotta know.

387
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:37,844
With this.

388
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:50,940
Here. Now you try.

389
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,027
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

390
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:55,653
How does it work?

391
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,740
I've never really
thought about it.

392
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,824
The old man gave it to me

393
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:02,035
so I just always believed
that it would.

394
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:09,834
What is this?

395
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:18,843
That's Spiderfly.

396
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:20,637
Now, that is creative.

397
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:24,724
And terrifying.

398
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,185
- That's... That's terrifying.
- Yeah. Here.

399
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:28,937
Thank-- We should prob-- Okay.

400
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:30,063
Run!

401
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,523
Mel, look out. I think I'm just
gonna sneak out of here.

402
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,651
-It's poisonous.
- Why did you make it poisonous?

403
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,028
Harold?

404
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:39,489
It's cold.

405
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,742
I need you to draw me a jacket.

406
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,203
Purple!

407
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,290
He's been here.

408
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:58,341
Aw. Hey, friend.

409
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:12,021
Wow, this is real power.

410
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:18,820
Hmm.

411
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:21,322
That'll do.

412
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:29,205
Hello, beautiful.

413
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:35,169
Hey, whoever's down there,
I called the cops.

414
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:36,295
They're on their way.

415
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:07,410
What was that?

416
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:18,254
We have it every day.

417
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:20,339
The best ever.

418
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:24,927
Oh, good morning, Terry!

419
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,014
Where'd those pies come from?

420
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,640
Harold made them.

421
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,727
Okay, well,
pies are not breakfast.

422
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:34,604
I'mma pretend I didn't hear
what you just said.

423
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:37,023
Pie is definitely
breakfast. Right.

424
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:38,316
Okay.

425
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:44,280
My house is purple.

426
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,115
Oh, yeah-yeah, yeah.

427
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:49,577
Well, you said it needed
some new paint,

428
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,454
so I thought I would make it
more cheerful

429
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:53,539
and then you wouldn't be
so unhappy all the time.

430
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,041
Mom, Harold can do magic.

431
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,376
He can literally make anything.

432
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:01,756
Uh, I wouldn't call it magic,
per se. It's more of a science.

433
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:03,382
I've been trying
to keep it a secret,

434
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,967
but with this little guy,

435
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,844
I can basically make
whatever I want.

436
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,554
Okay, can we talk for a sec?

437
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,308
Okay. Um,
I'm already dealing with,

438
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,393
like, an imaginary
dragon-lizard-lion

439
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,645
situation right now,

440
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:17,814
so can we not do
magic crayons, please?

441
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:22,193
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
No, sure, Terry.

442
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:23,444
Okay. Great.

443
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:25,238
Mom, I need to help Harold
look for his dad.

444
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:26,864
Oh, no.
You need to go to school.

445
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:28,282
And I need to go to work.

446
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:30,827
And these guys gotta go.
They gotta go.

447
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,664
Okay? Time to stop eating pie.
We all have to leave.

448
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:36,791
No more pie. Say bye.

449
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,042
Hey, Mel.

450
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,177
- Really?
- Yeah.

451
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:49,762
Thanks.

452
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,515
Bye, Mel. Have a good day.

453
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:53,975
- Thank you, Terry.
-Yep.

454
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,102
- Bye.
-Bye.

455
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:59,105
All right,
let's find your dad.

456
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:00,898
Wait, don't you have to
go to school?

457
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,233
I am going to school.

458
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:04,735
Just by a super-long
indirect way.

459
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,821
- Thanks, Mel.
- Yeah.

460
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,699
Wish we had more of that pie.

461
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:11,993
Yeah, no. No, no, no.

462
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:13,870
Listen, we gotta respect
your mom's rules.

463
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,204
No more pie.

464
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,374
Harold, you are a genius.

465
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,418
- This is way better than pies.
- Yeah.

466
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:24,297
Look, if we're gonna find
your dad, we need a plan.

467
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:25,506
I'm way ahead of you.

468
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,216
We're just gonna walk around,
looking for old men.

469
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:28,926
How hard could that be?

470
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:34,640
- Old Man!
- No, that's--

471
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,767
Old Man! It's me! It's Harold!

472
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:40,188
Who you calling old, punk!

473
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:41,814
Sorry, Mr. Perez.

474
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:45,943
Oh, this is... This is gonna be
a lot harder than I thought.

475
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:48,029
Maybe we need
to come up with a better plan.

476
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,952
"Place to go
when you need to know anything"?

477
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,204
That's it, that's what we do.

478
00:24:56,204 --> 00:24:58,289
The library,
it's kind of a long walk.

479
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:00,291
"Walk"? Who said walk?

480
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:11,552
Wait, guys! Wait for me!

481
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:15,806
Wait a minute,
I'm a moose on roller skates!

482
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:17,183
I'm doing it!

483
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:18,559
Oh, I think I'm getting
the hang of it!

484
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,518
No, I don't! Aah!

485
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:25,816
No, wait!

486
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,361
Oh, yeah.

487
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:36,661
Whoa, whoa...

488
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:38,913
Let's go!

489
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:41,040
Whoa!

490
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:55,471
- Ugh.
- What's wrong?

491
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,139
You'll see.

492
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:09,277
"'The Glaive,' chortled
the sorcerer Gondaldemor.

493
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:12,154
'It's the most powerful weapon
in the universe.

494
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:14,949
Only a fool
would dare wield it.'

495
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:16,701
He stepped forward,

496
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:19,161
his abs rippling
like liquid stone,

497
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:23,541
his pecs set upon them
like two impenetrable boulders,

498
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:25,251
only distinguishable as human...

499
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,128
...by the perfectly shaped

500
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:29,630
yet masculine nipples
they flaunted.

501
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,048
Ah.

502
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:34,051
- Let's go.
- 'The name's G'Garaur.'"

503
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:36,554
Amazing.

504
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:38,222
A big round of applause

505
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:41,892
for our head librarian,
Gary Natwick,

506
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:43,352
reading from his novel...

507
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:44,437
She's gone.

508
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:46,564
<i>...The Glaive of G'Ga--</i>

509
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:48,482
<i>G'Garaur.</i>
It's not that hard.

510
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:50,276
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

511
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:55,489
Ah. Mel, hi. Thanks for coming.

512
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:59,410
And hi,
Mel's imaginary dragon thingy.

513
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:02,788
You're touching his butt.

514
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:03,873
Sorry.

515
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:06,625
These are my friends
Harold and Moose.

516
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:08,711
Harold and Moose?

517
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:11,047
Yes, I've changed
quite a bit recently,

518
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:12,340
but I'm still the same inside.

519
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,176
You know, I'm vegetarian,
I'm pretty nimble, I'm docile.

520
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:17,136
But the greatest thing
about me is

521
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:19,805
I'm a wanderer by nature.

522
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:22,058
And that's what I'm about to do.

523
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:23,517
Some wandering.

524
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:25,561
Enjoy.

525
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,480
Uh, how many pages is that?

526
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,023
Seven hundred pages.

527
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:30,733
That is so many pages.

528
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:32,151
That must have taken you
weeks to write.

529
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,569
Try months, my friend.

530
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,197
I'm currently shopping it
to publishers.

531
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:39,283
There's probably
going to be a bidding war.

532
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:42,119
Mel.
That looks just like your mom.

533
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,581
No.

534
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,918
That's Zerry, my warrior queen.

535
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:51,253
I mean G'Garaur's warrior queen.

536
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:55,049
How is your beautiful mother?
Tell her hi from Library Gary.

537
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:56,842
We met in college.

538
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,969
And how do you know Terry?

539
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:02,181
You're not, uh,
seeing her, are you?

540
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,307
Oh, I saw her this morning.

541
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:04,934
But that's because
we stayed the night.

542
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:06,477
And I saw her yesterday.

543
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,979
Yeah. We've been seeing
a lot of each other, so...

544
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:10,564
But that's not why we're here.

545
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,983
We're here because I really
need your help, Library Gary.

546
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:16,070
I'm really trying
to find my old man.

547
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:19,657
We're a library.
We don't do missing persons.

548
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:21,992
My mom always talks

549
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:23,869
about what an amazing
librarian you are.

550
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:24,954
She does?

551
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:27,623
Yeah. How you can find
information about anything.

552
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:28,916
She said that?

553
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,626
Well, sorry, Harold.

554
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:32,503
Gary can't do it.

555
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:35,464
My mom will be so disappointed.

556
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,134
Wait.

557
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:41,679
For your mother...

558
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,306
anything.

559
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,308
All right,
what's your dad's name?

560
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:48,185
Funny thing, I don't know.

561
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:49,854
I really don't know. Um...

562
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:51,230
But I know he's an old man,

563
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,815
and I know
that he's in the Real World.

564
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,234
Okay.

565
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:56,360
Old man.

566
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:58,362
Planet Earth.

567
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:01,198
And that brings up
500 million people.

568
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:04,577
Um... Ooh, ooh, ooh. Uh...

569
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:05,911
Say "kind."

570
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,496
- And then...
- Wise.

571
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:08,414
And "wise."

572
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:09,915
And he talks like this.

573
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,836
Okay. I'll enter that
into the mainframe.

574
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:15,379
And clackity-clack-clack.

575
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:16,922
And none of this is helpful.

576
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:19,008
Let's go, guys,
we're wasting our time.

577
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:21,177
I'm just saying
that if this is all you've got,

578
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:22,428
you're never gonna find him.

579
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,723
Unless...

580
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:27,725
Unless...

581
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,810
he finds us.

582
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,187
Exactly!

583
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:32,938
Which is gonna be difficult

584
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,316
because he doesn't know
that we're looking for him.

585
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:36,484
Unless...

586
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,153
Unless...

587
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:46,702
- What?
- I don't know. That's-- I was--

588
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:49,246
Maybe you could fly in the air
in a little plane

589
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:51,999
and write messages to him
in the sky.

590
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:57,671
And that's why you
ask a librarian. Genius.

591
00:29:58,255 --> 00:29:59,507
Let's go have some fun.

592
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:01,717
- Yes.
- Purple crayon.

593
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:03,010
It's kind of my thing, so...

594
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:03,928
Cute.

595
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:05,221
Thank you for your help.

596
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:27,952
Whoa.

597
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:30,162
<i>Yes, well, unfortunately,</i>

598
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,957
<i>we've decided to pass
on</i> The Glaive of...

599
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:35,709
<i>- G'Garaur.
- Whatever.</i>

600
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:38,045
G'Garaur. It's not that hard.

601
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:39,380
<i>It is hard.</i>

602
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,464
<i>You don't want a book</i>

603
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:42,258
<i>where people can't even
say the title.</i>

604
00:30:42,258 --> 00:30:45,844
You're just like all the others,
Yasmin. You don't get it.

605
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,388
My world is bigger

606
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:51,725
than Hogwarts and Middle-earth
and Narnia combined.

607
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:53,435
<i>Okay.</i>

608
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,231
<i>Don't know what that means.</i>

609
00:30:57,231 --> 00:30:58,899
It means,
"Thank you for your time.

610
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:00,859
"I hope you reconsider."

611
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:17,501
Ta-da!

612
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:21,380
<i>Harold and the Purple Crayon.</i>

613
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:26,844
Anybody ever heard the term

614
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:28,554
"when a moose flies"?

615
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:32,516
No! 'Cause moose don't fly.
I am a land animal.

616
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:35,311
Statistically,
planes are safer than cars.

617
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:37,187
What about a plane
drawn by Harold?

618
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:41,734
- It's gonna be great.
- It's gonna be great.

619
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:44,361
Statistically,
what does that mean?

620
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:48,574
"Harold left a very hungry moose
and a deserving porcupine

621
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:49,742
"to finish it
where he was."

622
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:51,201
Hey!

623
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:53,621
Quiet, please.
This is a library.

624
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:59,585
{\an8}With that crayon,
I can show them my world.

625
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:10,929
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Watch out, red light!

626
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,640
Oh!

627
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:18,103
This is awesome!

628
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:20,105
- Whoo!
- Look out!

629
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,940
What? I can't--

630
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,567
Actually, hold on a second.

631
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:26,195
Whoa.

632
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:34,203
Sorry about that,
buddy. What were you saying?

633
00:32:34,495 --> 00:32:36,038
I said, "Look out!"

634
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:36,955
Oh.

635
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:40,959
That was close, huh?

636
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,924
We should leave a phone number.

637
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:49,593
But my mom says that I can't
give my number to strangers.

638
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:52,096
She didn't say you couldn't
give her number to strangers.

639
00:33:01,355 --> 00:33:03,649
Mmh-mmh.

640
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:14,034
It's working!

641
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:18,330
Woo-hoo!

642
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:42,104
Harold!

643
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:44,064
Ooh.
Sorry, Moose. Sorry!

644
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:50,112
Harold! Get me out
the air! Land this thing!

645
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:51,572
That's not nearly as fun.

646
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:53,449
Hang on!

647
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,162
Yeah!

648
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:01,832
See? Now that is fun.

649
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:03,250
Look, that's my school.

650
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,835
All right!
Let's get you down there.

651
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:11,467
It looks like it's gonna be
another perfect landing, folks.

652
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:13,927
So just sit back, relax and--

653
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:15,429
- Oh!
-Whoa, whoa...

654
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:20,976
I can't believe
we're still rolling.

655
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:22,895
I feel like
I'm in a washing machine.

656
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,775
Maybe pie isn't breakfast.

657
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:36,784
We gotta do that again.

658
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:39,620
Oh, hey!

659
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,622
- All right.
-Whoa.

660
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:44,208
Well, good luck
finding your old man.

661
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:46,460
Thanks. Have fun at school.

662
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:52,132
- Huh. Look at this.
- Hmm?

663
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:57,888
Hello.

664
00:34:57,888 --> 00:35:00,140
Hey. I saw your number
in the sky.

665
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,391
What?

666
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:02,768
I figured it was a sign.

667
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:05,020
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

668
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,189
I could be your old man
if you'll be my old lady.

669
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:09,983
I think you have
the wrong number. Okay?

670
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:11,777
- Hello?
-<i>Hello?</i>

671
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:13,529
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hello?

672
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:16,698
Yeah, uh, I got your message
in the sky.

673
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,826
Let me guess. You're an old man.

674
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:19,910
<i>Yeah.</i>

675
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,120
- Hello?
- Hello?

676
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,705
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hello?

677
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,499
How old of a guy
are you looking for?

678
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:28,001
- Is this some kind of joke?
<i>- No, no, no.</i>

679
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:29,711
You left me a message
in the sky.

680
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,046
That wasn't me. So...

681
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:32,464
I can't hear you.

682
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,550
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

683
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,759
Please stop calling me.

684
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,571
- You're late, Melvin.
- Where've you been, weirdo?

685
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:56,822
- Give me this.
- Stop.

686
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:58,949
- Where you goin'?
- Let go of me!

687
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:01,201
Bro.

688
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:02,995
You just hit my bro.

689
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:06,498
What's with the noise?
What's going on?

690
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,375
Principal's office, now.

691
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:14,756
There it is.

692
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:17,092
The store that sells everything.

693
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,845
Come on, let's go find Terry.

694
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,808
Oh, Moose! Miniature train ride!

695
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,393
No, Moose!

696
00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:30,939
What?
What are you doin', man?

697
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:34,359
Wow.
Whoa!

698
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,362
This place is next level!

699
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:42,075
Wow!

700
00:36:43,744 --> 00:36:45,495
This place
has everything!

701
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,331
Cheese... balls?

702
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:50,250
It's like cheese, but puffier.

703
00:36:50,918 --> 00:36:53,086
Wow. Oh,
and they have these things!

704
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:54,421
Whatever these are.

705
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:57,257

but soft and heavy.

00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:15,525
Hi. I'm old. I'm, like, 40.

713
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:17,569
Okay. Can I talk
to your mom, please?

714
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,738

Terry.

716
00:37:25,494 --> 00:37:28,121
What did we say
about personal calls?

717
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:29,247
Oh, it was a wrong num--

718
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,792
I've had like
600 wrong numbers today, sorry.

719
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:33,377
Terry, I started out
just like you,

720
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:34,628
busting my hump on the floor.

721
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:36,004
Right.

722
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:38,048
But 12 years later...

723
00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:43,762
- I'm a manager.
- Manager.

724
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:46,056
- Okay? Dreams do come true.
- Yep.

725
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:48,058
- But you have to work for them.
- Right.

726
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:49,893
- I have an opportunity for you.
- Mm-hmm.

727
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:51,353
I've got a backlogged stockroom.

728
00:37:51,353 --> 00:37:54,398
This could be your moment.
Are you ready to take your shot?

729
00:37:54,398 --> 00:37:56,900
- You just try and stop me.
- Great.

730
00:37:57,818 --> 00:37:59,611
- This is your last warning.
- Okay.

731
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:00,696
Great.

732

What are you guys doing here?

738
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:23,552
Hi, Terry.
Hey, did my old man call yet?

739
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:26,930
Oh, no.
Your old man has not called.

740
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:27,973
Oh.

741
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:30,726
But old men are calling me
every 15 seconds.

742
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:32,436
Do you have something
to do with that?

743
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,105
You guys gotta
get out of here, okay?

744
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:36,773
I'm this close to losing my job.

745
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:38,567
Oh, congrats.
You hated this job.

746
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:40,277
No, I love this job.
Hey, Prasad.

747
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:43,321
Okay, well, I am very confused.

748
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,491
Will you idiots
stop calling me?

749
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,535
Terry? It's Principal Brady.

750
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:50,662
- Principal Brady? Hi.
<i>- Yes.</i>

751
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:51,872
Your son Melvin

752
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:53,707
has been involved
in an incident in school.

753
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:54,958
- What?
<i>- He's okay.</i>

754
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,043
But I'm afraid we're gonna

755
00:38:56,043 --> 00:38:57,461
have to send him
home for the day.

756
00:38:57,461 --> 00:39:01,506
Yeah, no, sorry.
I'll be right there. Okay, bye.

757
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,508
Okay, Mel's in trouble
at school,

758
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,719
but I'm gonna lose my job
if I miss this shift.

759
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,473
- When people need help, we help.
- Right.

760
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:11,224
You know
who I learned that from?

761
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:12,976
From a lady
who hit us with her car.

762
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:13,894
Mm-hmm.

763
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:15,645
Do you know who that lady is?

764
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:19,107
- You.
- Me.

765
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:22,944
This is the stockroom.

766
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:29,659
So you take the boxes,
you look at the label,

767
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:31,828
and you put them
on the right shelf.

768
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:34,790
Piece of cake, right?

769
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:37,292
I'll be back in an hour.
Thank you.

770
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:43,965
- See? Piece of cake.
- Mm.

771
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:52,557
I can't take it anymore.
This is soul-crushing.

772
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:56,103
Oh, God. Having a job in
the Real World is so terrible.

773
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:58,814
I wouldn't get a job. Why would
anybody wanna get a job?

774
00:39:58,814 --> 00:40:01,525
I don't know. How long
have we been doing this?

775
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:02,984
- Six minutes!
- Aah!

776
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:12,786
What happened?

777
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:15,747
You're not the kind of kid
who gets into fights.

778
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,165
It was an accident.

779
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,000
They tried to take my whistle.

780
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,129
Okay. Well, I think
you should forget about Carl

781
00:40:22,129 --> 00:40:24,673
and start making
real friends. Okay?

782
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:26,883
Harold believes in Carl.

783
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:29,469
Well, maybe
we shouldn't take life advice

784
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:32,055
from a person
that does crayon magic.

785

We are here to help.

Do you need-- Nope,
you don't need any help. Okay.

This'll be way more fun.

813
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:07,984
Whoa...

814
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:15,784
This is fun, Mom!

815
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:18,078
Whoa!

816
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:55,907
Hurry up.
Please evacuate the building.

817
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:59,244
I'm gonna sue you.
And I'm taking these bowls.

818
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:03,331
- But, Mom, I wanna do it again.
- Shh!

819
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:05,625
But, Mom!

820
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:09,421
How did you even do this?
I actually wanna know.

821
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:12,048
- That's a valid question.
- Yeah. I--

822
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:15,093
Do not say anything
about magic crayons.

823
00:43:16,303 --> 00:43:17,846
What were you thinking?

824
00:43:17,846 --> 00:43:19,639
Oh, honestly, I don't do
a lot of thinking.

825
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,766
- I'm more of an improv guy.
- True.

826
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:22,934
Good news, Terry.

827
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:25,228
Police are all over
the security tapes.

828
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:28,231
They'll find out who did this,
and when they do...

829
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:29,858
...it will not be pretty.

830
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:32,193
Who are you guys?

831
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:33,945
We're friends of Terry's,
just filling in.

832
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:37,449
But I gotta be honest,
your job is super boring.

833
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:38,867
No wonder you hate it so much.

834
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:48,126
You do sell pumas, right?
I wasn't wrong about that?

835
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:53,256
We're really, really sorry.
Is there...

836
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:55,342
Yeah, is there anything
we can do?

837
00:43:55,342 --> 00:43:58,011
You guys have done plenty.
I think you can stop.

838
00:44:00,347 --> 00:44:03,308
Mom, you did ask them to help.
They did their best.

839
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:05,977
Besides, you hated that job.

840
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:08,229
I'm just saying,
maybe now you can find something

841
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:09,731
that makes you happy.

842
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,985
Please?

843
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:17,739
I did always
wanna trash that place.

844
00:44:19,366 --> 00:44:20,408
Okay.

845
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:22,077
Come on.

846
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,919
You ever look at your life
and go,

847
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:32,045
"How'd I end up here?"

848
00:44:32,045 --> 00:44:35,131
I'm asking myself
that question right now.

849
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:37,550
Yeah, I thought I was
gonna be a concert pianist.

850
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:38,635
Wait a second.

851
00:44:38,635 --> 00:44:40,387
Maybe working at Ollie's
wasn't your true passion.

852
00:44:40,387 --> 00:44:41,846
Ya think?

853
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:44,933
Terry, you need to play piano.
It's who you are.

854
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:48,853
I don't know, I haven't really
played since my husband died.

855
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,063
I'm a little rusty.

856
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:55,151
Ice cream truck.
We love ice cream, don't we?

857
00:44:56,069 --> 00:44:59,030
Yeah, yeah, we...
We love ice cream.

858
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,157
Ice cream sounds great.
Let's go. Let's go.

859
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:03,368
Let's get this ice cream.
Come on, Terry.

860
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:04,953
Okay.
I don't like it that much.

861
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:23,721
Um...

862
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:25,640
How did-- You know what?

863
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:29,269
I'm not even gonna ask anymore.
This is incredible.

864
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:30,520
I mean...

865
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,397
Play for us, please.

866
00:45:33,273 --> 00:45:35,066
I don't do that anymore.

867
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:38,194
Come on, Mom.
You haven't played for so long.

868
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:40,238
Dad and I used to love it.
Please?

869
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:11,936
Do these guys
look like criminals to you?

870
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:14,481
They look like morons.

871
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:16,858
There's something more to this.

872
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:18,026
I have witnesses saying

873
00:46:18,026 --> 00:46:20,403
they saw him
making things out of thin air.

874
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:22,572
You gotta humor the crazies.

875
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,745
Ah. Harold. What a trail of
clues you have left.

876
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:40,548
Harold?

877
00:46:43,176 --> 00:46:44,260
- Harold?
- Mmh-mmh.

878
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:47,180
Harold?

879
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:49,724
Miss? Can I help you?

880
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,393
Yes!

881
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:54,312
Thank God
someone's offering help.

882
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:55,396
I was beginning to think

883
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:57,065
the Real World
was full of meanies.

884
00:46:57,774 --> 00:47:01,069
Don't do that.
Crayons are for paper, sweetie.

885
00:47:01,069 --> 00:47:03,530
Uh...

886
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:04,822
Sorry, what did you just say?

887
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,242
She can't just draw
wherever she wants.

888
00:47:07,242 --> 00:47:10,245
Well, you have no idea
what that could've been.

889
00:47:10,245 --> 00:47:11,829
Don't listen to her, mate.

890
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,499
Crayons aren't just for paper.
They are for everywhere.

891
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:16,501
I can't wait to see
what you make.

892
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:17,627
If you aren't here to eat,

893
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:19,546
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

894
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,424
Oh, I'll eat.

895
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:35,228
You're gonna have to leave now.

896
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,692
Hey!

897
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:57,000
I'm telling you,
this is all connected.

898
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:06,301
That's her!

899
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:10,972
You! Get back here!

900
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:53,306
So good!

901
00:48:54,057 --> 00:48:56,851
No, that was all her.
Well, I mean, I made the piano.

902
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:59,020
-Harold, Moose, hi.
- Oh, hi.

903
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:01,648
- Oh, Terry.
- Hi, Gary.

904
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:04,233
Your music was a golden elixir,

905
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:06,611
and I drank
until I was intoxicated.

906
00:49:07,195 --> 00:49:08,655
Did you, now?

907
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,615
Thanks, Gary.

908
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:12,784
Harold, I have wonderful news.

909
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:15,119
I think I know
who your old man is.

910
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,580
You know who my-- You do?
He does!

911
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,207
Oh, Gary, you're the best.

912
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:20,333
It'll take some explaining,

913
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:22,251
so follow me
and I'll tell you everything.

914
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:24,003
Okay. Okay.

915
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:25,171
W-W-Wait.

916
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:27,590
Why do you wanna
help them all of a sudden?

917
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,425
I'm a nice person.

918
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:30,677
Well, I'm coming, too.

919
00:49:30,677 --> 00:49:31,761
No, no, no, no, honey.

920
00:49:31,761 --> 00:49:33,680
You've had enough excitement
for one day. We gotta go home.

921
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,015
Yes, Mel,
I think it's past your bedtime.

922
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:37,225
What a wonderful boy.

923
00:49:37,225 --> 00:49:38,309
Thank you.

924
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:42,271
He could use
a father figure, perhaps.

925
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:45,983
Um, okay.
Are you sure you're all right?

926
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,902
Terry, you've done
more than enough.

927
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:49,445
Let Gary carry this burden.

928
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:51,364
I know exactly what to do.

929
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:53,616
He knows exactly what to do!

930
00:49:54,826 --> 00:49:55,910
Ready?

931
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:58,663
When someone
tells a story,

932
00:49:58,663 --> 00:50:00,206
they create a whole world.

933
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:03,459
And usually, the characters
stay there in that world.

934
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:06,212
What... What are you...
What are you talking about?

935
00:50:06,796 --> 00:50:11,759
{\an8}This is the world
that you come from.

936
00:50:18,558 --> 00:50:21,060
Moose, that's us.
That's me, that's you.

937
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,062
Oh, this is incredible.

938
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:25,356
It's a whole book about us.

939
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,817
Do you know
what brought you two to life?

940
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:30,611
It's what your crayon
is made of.

941
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:35,199
The most mysterious, powerful,
extraordinary stuff on earth.

942
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:36,909
Wax.

943
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:38,995
Pure imagination.

944
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,999
Oh, that is so cool.

945
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:46,544
I wanna go home. I miss home.
You know somethin'?

946
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:48,337
I'm goin' in.

947
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:49,422
That's...

948
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:51,299
Let me in, book.
I wanna go home!

949
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:53,676
I gotta step in it, maybe.

950
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:54,844
That's not gonna work.

951
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:57,054
And that's a $12 fine.

952
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,598
Soiling.

953
00:51:02,018 --> 00:51:04,020
"By Crockett Johnson."
The Narrator, Crockett Johnson!

954
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,438
This is my old man.

955
00:51:05,438 --> 00:51:07,064
Moose, we finally
know who it is!

956
00:51:13,488 --> 00:51:14,989
Porcupine?

957
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:16,574
Porcupine, is that you?

958
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:17,742
Harold?

959
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:19,368
Yes! Harold!

960
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:21,579
I knew it! I knew I'd find you!

961
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,748
Oh, my goodness!

962
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:26,125
- Moose?
-Yeah!

963
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:27,585
Porcupine, it's you?

964
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:30,129
Look at you. You in human form.

965
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:32,423
I know,
it's so weird!

966
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:33,966
I love having these.

967
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:36,427
I'm not really comfortable yet.
I miss my hooves, you know?

968
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:38,137
Yeah, no, I miss my quills.

969
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:40,181
It's so good having
the gang back together again.

970
00:51:40,181 --> 00:51:41,349
I know!

971
00:51:43,226 --> 00:51:45,686
You are under arrest
for breaking and entering!

972
00:51:45,686 --> 00:51:46,771
Is there a problem here?

973
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:48,606
That porcupine
is a friend of ours.

974
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:56,781
Uh, would it be possible
for me to get my crayon back?

975
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:00,034
Tell y'all somethin',
moose do not belong in jail.

976
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:02,662
I really don't like
the Real World at all.

977
00:52:02,662 --> 00:52:04,080
I just wanna go home so bad.

978
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,624
Moose, relax. We can fix this.
We just need a plan.

979
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:09,210
Whatever the plan is, can you
not leave me behind this time?

980
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:12,046
No, of course not.
Hey, hey. Come here, come here.

981
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:14,966
It's Harold and Moose
and Porcupine, okay?

982
00:52:14,966 --> 00:52:17,885
We're gonna figure out how to
get our world back together.

983
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:20,555
We just gotta
get that crayon first.

984
00:52:31,274 --> 00:52:32,650
How do you do?

985
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:39,323
You cannot keep me up in here!
Keep me locked up in here!

986
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:40,616
Do you know what I am?

987
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:41,951
You better get down!

988
00:52:41,951 --> 00:52:43,411
{\an8}You're so lucky

989
00:52:43,411 --> 00:52:45,079
you don't have a face
full of quills

990
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:46,122
- right now!
- I'm crazy, too.

991
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:56,173
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Whoa, whoa...

992
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:05,474
Come on, come on! Let me in!
Open up! Let me in!

993
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:07,643
Come on, Moose!
Come on, hurry, hurry!

994
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:10,563
You left the door open?

995
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:16,903
Okay. How do we
get through that wall? Ooh.

996
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:21,782
Yeah!
I can't believe that worked!

997
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,665
I need to get some crayons.

998
00:53:32,752 --> 00:53:33,961
Okay, class.

999
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:35,880
Time is up. Pencils down.

1000
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:45,556
Can I go to the bathroom?

1001
00:53:49,185 --> 00:53:52,063
- Hey.
- Hey! Give it back.

1002
00:53:52,063 --> 00:53:54,440
Why? Is your pet dragon
gonna hurt me?

1003
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:57,360
This isn't funny. Give it back.

1004
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,362
See ya later.

1005
00:53:59,362 --> 00:54:00,947
No, no, no!

1006
00:54:01,948 --> 00:54:03,407
Come on, let me out.

1007
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:06,160
Ah...

1008
00:54:14,627 --> 00:54:16,504
Look, check out
this stupid whistle.

1009
00:54:16,504 --> 00:54:18,547
It doesn't even work.

1010
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:31,018
Let's get out of here!

1011
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:49,996
Mel, what did you do?

1012
00:54:53,416 --> 00:54:54,709
Sorry, Ms. Hemm.

1013
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:58,254
Thanks, Carl.

1014
00:54:59,255 --> 00:55:00,881
Don't let anybody see you, okay?

1015
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:08,931
That's cool.

1016
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:11,809
-Mel! Hey!
-Ha-ha!

1017
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:13,060
Harold, Moose!

1018
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:14,603
And Porcupine. Nice to meet you.

1019
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:16,147
Hi, Porcupine.

1020
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:18,149
Did you find your dad?

1021
00:55:18,149 --> 00:55:19,525
Yes! His name
is Crockett Johnson.

1022
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:20,735
- Johnson.
-Gary was helping us.

1023
00:55:20,735 --> 00:55:22,570
Then we all got arrested, which
is a story for another time.

1024
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:23,654
Found him.

1025
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:26,073
His house is only like
20 minutes away from here.

1026
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:28,617
Oh, that's perfect! Let's get
out of here. Come on, Mel.

1027
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:31,078
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I have thumbs now. I drive.

1028
00:55:33,456 --> 00:55:35,708
Um, have you ever
driven a motorcycle before?

1029
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:38,335
I'm a porcupine.
I've never done anything before.

1030
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:48,679
Slow down, Porcupine!

1031
00:56:00,816 --> 00:56:03,110
Can you believe
I've never done this before?

1032
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:04,570
Yes, I can.

1033
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,405
Look at the road.
Look at the road.

1034
00:56:32,765 --> 00:56:34,308
<i>Shaknathar!</i>

1035
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:37,144
Well, what do you mean
he ran away?

1036
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:38,979
Okay. Thank you.

1037
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:16,976
Hello. Welcome to
the Crockett Johnson House.

1038
00:57:16,976 --> 00:57:18,394
Are you fans of his work?

1039
00:57:18,394 --> 00:57:21,647
Yeah. Yeah. You could say that.

1040
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:23,399
We've traveled a long way
to get here.

1041
00:57:23,399 --> 00:57:25,276
And I just can't wait
to meet him face-to-face.

1042
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:27,611
Oh, well, this is a museum now.

1043
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:29,446
Crockett Johnson passed away.

1044
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,283
Passed away?

1045
00:57:34,869 --> 00:57:37,079
He's not alive anymore, Harold.

1046
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:38,831
It's like my dad.

1047
00:57:39,832 --> 00:57:41,792
I'd be more than happy
to give you a tour.

1048
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:42,960
No, that's okay.

1049
00:57:44,253 --> 00:57:46,213
Thank you. Have a good day.

1050
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:47,673
Thanks. You, too.

1051
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:52,094
I'm sorry, Harold.

1052
00:57:55,723 --> 00:57:57,683
That's the end of the story.

1053
00:58:04,732 --> 00:58:06,317
Mel! Mel!

1054
00:58:06,317 --> 00:58:07,693
Come here.

1055
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:10,237
What happened? Are you okay?
I was so worried.

1056
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:11,864
The principal called and said
you trashed the school

1057
00:58:11,864 --> 00:58:13,157
and you ran away?

1058
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:14,575
No, it wasn't me. It was Carl.

1059
00:58:14,575 --> 00:58:16,452
What is going on with you?

1060
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:18,078
We found out that Harold
is from a book,

1061
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:19,872
so we came here to find his dad.

1062
00:58:19,872 --> 00:58:21,624
Mel, go wait in the car.

1063
00:58:21,624 --> 00:58:23,626
- But, Mom, Harold was--
- Just go!

1064
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:27,796
Go.

1065
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:33,219
Look, I don't know
what's going on here,

1066
00:58:33,219 --> 00:58:34,970
or whether you're just crazy.

1067
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:36,305
But ever since you showed up,

1068
00:58:36,305 --> 00:58:38,182
our lives have been
turned upside down.

1069
00:58:38,182 --> 00:58:39,892
I have a kid to protect.

1070
00:58:39,892 --> 00:58:41,227
And you're filling his head
with stuff

1071
00:58:41,227 --> 00:58:42,603
that's not good for him.

1072
00:58:42,603 --> 00:58:45,940
So, I'm gonna have to ask you
to stay away from me and my son.

1073
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,274
Just leave us alone.

1074
00:58:53,781 --> 00:58:54,907
I'm sorry.

1075
00:58:57,326 --> 00:58:59,787
I was wrong about everything.

1076
00:59:08,921 --> 00:59:10,130
Porcupine?

1077
00:59:12,091 --> 00:59:14,718
It's disappeared.

1078
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:16,512
- Harold.
- What do we do?

1079
00:59:16,512 --> 00:59:17,721
It's over.

1080
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:20,140
What do you mean it's over?
You can do anything.

1081
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:21,350
No, I can't.

1082
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:23,227
It was the old man.

1083
00:59:23,227 --> 00:59:24,979
It was his book.
It was his world.

1084
00:59:24,979 --> 00:59:28,274
I'm just a dumb drawing
drawing other dumb drawings.

1085
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:31,026
So is that what we are?

1086
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,445
Just some dumb drawings?

1087
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:35,739
I'm sorry.

1088
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,164
Moose?

1089
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:47,251
Porcupine?

1090
00:59:49,461 --> 00:59:50,546
No.

1091
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:54,341
No.

1092
01:00:37,676 --> 01:00:39,053
Oh, Old Man.

1093
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:43,891
You never should have
given me this.

1094
01:01:17,466 --> 01:01:18,467
Harold.

1095
01:01:21,136 --> 01:01:23,055
How are you doing, my friend?

1096
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:35,025
Mom?

1097
01:01:35,901 --> 01:01:38,070
I've got a bad feeling.
I think Harold's in trouble.

1098
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:40,280
No, the only one
who's in trouble is you.

1099
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,658
And I don't want to hear
any more about Harold.

1100
01:01:42,658 --> 01:01:43,742
Get in the car.

1101
01:01:53,127 --> 01:01:56,255
Mom! Mom, everything Harold drew
is disappearing.

1102
01:01:56,255 --> 01:01:58,590
I'm serious, Mom.
Something's wrong.

1103
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:01,385
I don't trust Gary.
He's up to something.

1104
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:03,303
We gotta help. And I need Carl.

1105
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:04,930
- Give me the whistle.
- Mom.

1106
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:06,306
Give it to me.

1107
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:22,656
You've let everyone down.

1108
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:24,783
But without anyone to guide you,

1109
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:27,035
you were bound
to mess things up.

1110
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:31,498
You can't use the crayon all
by yourself. It's too powerful.

1111
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:34,209
Let me guide your story.

1112
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:36,920
My stuff's a little darker.
It's for ages 14 and up.

1113
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,714
But I can do it.

1114
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:42,217
Harold, I can help you.

1115
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:45,596
Give me the crayon.

1116
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:27,638
I'm a creative person.

1117
01:03:27,638 --> 01:03:29,681
I create worlds.

1118
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:33,060
If you'd read my book,
you would know that this...

1119
01:03:33,852 --> 01:03:35,479
is the Dungeon of Azgarach.

1120
01:03:38,232 --> 01:03:42,694
Oh! These are strange,
cool bracelets.

1121
01:03:42,694 --> 01:03:45,072
Well, I'm glad you like them.

1122
01:03:46,365 --> 01:03:48,325
You're going to be wearing them
for a very long time.

1123
01:03:55,707 --> 01:03:57,501
All of the people
who rejected me,

1124
01:03:57,501 --> 01:03:59,753
I'll show them
how wrong they were.

1125
01:04:00,587 --> 01:04:03,924
Now they'll see
what Library Gary is capable of.

1126
01:04:03,924 --> 01:04:05,842
No, Gary, that's not
what the crayon is for.

1127
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:08,011
You're supposed to use it
to make people happy.

1128
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:10,264
Revenge will make me happy.

1129
01:04:22,484 --> 01:04:23,485
Harold? Ah!

1130
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:27,155
Gary, leave him alone.
Let him go.

1131
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:29,324
I really feel like I've gone
too far down this path

1132
01:04:29,324 --> 01:04:30,492
to turn back now.

1133
01:04:30,492 --> 01:04:32,578
I know Terry
is going to be distraught

1134
01:04:32,578 --> 01:04:34,329
about her missing son,
of course,

1135
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:36,164
but don't worry.

1136
01:04:36,164 --> 01:04:38,750
Library Gary will comfort her.

1137
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:41,878
Maybe someday
I'll even draw her a new son.

1138
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,839
A cool one that looks like me.

1139
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:46,341
You're a seriously
messed-up guy, Gary.

1140
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:47,926
Oh, yeah? How about this?

1141
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:51,555
How about what? How about what?

1142
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:10,407
Oh, no. The Real World
is nothing like I imagined it.

1143
01:05:13,577 --> 01:05:14,578
No.

1144
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:21,835
Mel?

1145
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:24,713
Can we talk?

1146
01:05:27,507 --> 01:05:28,550
Mel--

1147
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:30,135
Mel?

1148
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:37,559
Now the world will gaze upon me

1149
01:05:38,602 --> 01:05:40,103
and be impressed.

1150
01:05:40,896 --> 01:05:43,398
Onward, Thrahaknahar!

1151
01:05:52,658 --> 01:05:54,326
I'm so sorry, Mel.

1152
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:57,746
I can't draw us out of this one.

1153
01:05:57,746 --> 01:05:59,414
I really messed up.

1154
01:06:00,332 --> 01:06:04,211
No, you didn't.
You made things a lot better.

1155
01:06:06,046 --> 01:06:07,506
You believed in me.

1156
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,342
And my mom.

1157
01:06:10,342 --> 01:06:11,510
And Carl.

1158
01:06:14,805 --> 01:06:16,515
Just believe in yourself.

1159
01:06:17,516 --> 01:06:19,059
I do.

1160
01:06:23,647 --> 01:06:25,607
And we <i>can</i> draw
our way out of here.

1161
01:07:05,731 --> 01:07:06,982
Hey! Hey!

1162
01:07:06,982 --> 01:07:09,609
Hyah!

1163
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:11,236
Let's go get him.

1164
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:18,535
Hyah!

1165
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:22,122
Upon this rock
I shall erect my kingdom.

1166
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:37,721
That was fun, right?
Go hide, go hide.

1167
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:40,515
How did you get out?

1168
01:07:41,725 --> 01:07:42,893
With this.

1169
01:07:46,104 --> 01:07:47,355
Mine's bigger.

1170
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:51,067
Look, Gary, it doesn't belong
to you, okay? Give it back.

1171
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,570
Mm. Sorry.
I can't do that, Harold.

1172
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:25,310
Draw.

1173
01:08:32,776 --> 01:08:33,944
Huh?

1174
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:43,245
Yay for Harold!

1175
01:09:11,106 --> 01:09:12,858
Ow.

1176
01:09:22,868 --> 01:09:24,744
Fire!

1177
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:26,079
Harold, look out!

1178
01:09:35,755 --> 01:09:37,132
Oh! Oh!

1179
01:09:42,971 --> 01:09:44,764
You'll have to do
better than that.

1180
01:09:50,395 --> 01:09:51,479
That was better.

1181
01:09:55,150 --> 01:09:57,444
No! No! No.

1182
01:09:57,444 --> 01:09:58,570
No. No.

1183
01:09:58,570 --> 01:09:59,905
-Give me the crayon.
-No.

1184
01:09:59,905 --> 01:10:01,531
- Yes.
- Never!

1185
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:03,366
Gary! No, no...

1186
01:10:04,993 --> 01:10:06,036
Mm-mm.

1187
01:10:08,496 --> 01:10:11,166
Gary! Everyone knows
you don't eat crayons.

1188
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:13,001
Not good.

1189
01:10:21,885 --> 01:10:23,261
The power.

1190
01:10:24,638 --> 01:10:25,764
I feel it.

1191
01:10:44,115 --> 01:10:45,784
Where is he?

1192
01:10:45,784 --> 01:10:47,035
Gary, where are you?

1193
01:10:47,619 --> 01:10:49,287
There is no Gary.

1194
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:56,378
Only G'Garaur.

1195
01:10:59,047 --> 01:11:01,341
Mel! Oh, my God. Are you okay?

1196
01:11:01,341 --> 01:11:03,677
I was so worried.
What is happening here?

1197
01:11:03,677 --> 01:11:05,512
Mom, Gary swallowed the crayon.

1198
01:11:05,512 --> 01:11:06,805
I think he's
trying to kill Harold.

1199
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:13,019
- We have to get out of here.
-Yeah.

1200
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:14,938
Terry, don't go.

1201
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:16,690
Come. Join me.

1202
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:19,192
So that we may
rule over this land.

1203
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:22,195
Man and woman.

1204
01:11:23,154 --> 01:11:25,323
- No thank you.
- Really?

1205
01:11:25,323 --> 01:11:27,867
Yup. No.
I do like your new hair though.

1206
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:34,332
I'll show you
what you're missing.

1207
01:11:43,258 --> 01:11:44,634
The glaive...

1208
01:11:46,094 --> 01:11:47,971
of G'Garaur!

1209
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:51,433
Run!

1210
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:56,730
Watch out!

1211
01:12:04,154 --> 01:12:05,155
Harold!

1212
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:08,575
Watch out!

1213
01:12:12,954 --> 01:12:14,289
Harold!

1214
01:12:14,289 --> 01:12:15,582
Oh, no!

1215
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:23,840
Hey. I should have believed you
a long time ago.

1216
01:12:30,472 --> 01:12:33,892
You see, Harold,
this power was meant for me.

1217
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:48,907
Sic him, Carl!

1218
01:12:59,626 --> 01:13:02,087
Oh. Not the hair.

1219
01:13:02,087 --> 01:13:05,215
That is the only thing
she likes about me.

1220
01:13:14,474 --> 01:13:15,934
Carl!

1221
01:13:17,435 --> 01:13:19,020
No!

1222
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,480
No, Gary. You have to stop this.

1223
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,315
This isn't
what the crayon is for.

1224
01:13:24,609 --> 01:13:26,111
G'Garaur!

1225
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:31,866
It's over, Harold.

1226
01:13:31,866 --> 01:13:36,204
You're just a cartoon drawing
from the young reader section

1227
01:13:36,204 --> 01:13:39,374
with no narrator
to tell you what to do

1228
01:13:39,374 --> 01:13:41,292
and no friends to help you.

1229
01:13:46,297 --> 01:13:48,049
Well, I believe in me.

1230
01:13:48,675 --> 01:13:50,343
And I believe in my friends.

1231
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:52,095
Friends are overrated.

1232
01:13:52,887 --> 01:13:54,180
So I've been told.

1233
01:14:03,481 --> 01:14:05,108
- Do you need a hand?
- Yes!

1234
01:14:05,108 --> 01:14:07,652
I've lost the crayon.
We have to get it back.

1235
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:11,614
Oh, look, the whole
storybook back together again.

1236
01:14:11,614 --> 01:14:13,074
How touching.

1237
01:14:14,534 --> 01:14:16,202
I've got this.

1238
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:20,790
<i>Thraknah!</i>

1239
01:14:21,708 --> 01:14:22,792
Ha!

1240
01:14:23,751 --> 01:14:25,086
Yes!

1241
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:30,842
I will not give up
this power, Harold.

1242
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:37,599
I hate to do this to you, Gary,
but you left me no choice.

1243
01:14:37,599 --> 01:14:39,517
Nothing you can draw
will be beat me.

1244
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:42,187
Spiderfly.

1245
01:14:52,614 --> 01:14:54,073
The glaive!

1246
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:55,033
Ah!

1247
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:58,578
Well, Moose, you're up.

1248
01:14:59,287 --> 01:15:00,330
What?

1249
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:22,143
Oh.

1250
01:15:41,788 --> 01:15:42,872
We did it!

1251
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:44,415
- Come on!
- Yes!

1252
01:15:46,668 --> 01:15:48,044
Carl!

1253
01:15:58,763 --> 01:15:59,806
You okay?

1254
01:16:04,018 --> 01:16:06,896
I just wanted a place
where I belonged.

1255
01:16:09,983 --> 01:16:11,943
I wanted my world

1256
01:16:12,944 --> 01:16:14,237
to be real.

1257
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:49,605
It's beautiful.

1258
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:52,525
Why does that woman
look like me?

1259
01:16:55,153 --> 01:16:56,446
Does she?

1260
01:16:59,282 --> 01:17:01,451
Uh, go, go, go.
You belong there...

1261
01:17:01,451 --> 01:17:02,952
G'Garaur.

1262
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:07,290
You said it right.

1263
01:17:20,553 --> 01:17:22,096
Oh, and, Harold, I--

1264
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:25,224
We should leave him in there.

1265
01:18:14,941 --> 01:18:16,150
Yeah.

1266
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:18,486
Aw, your antlers!

1267
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:56,566
I wonder what
the old man would say

1268
01:18:56,566 --> 01:18:57,775
if he could see me now.

1269
01:18:58,484 --> 01:19:00,862
I think he would
have been proud of you.

1270
01:19:03,281 --> 01:19:04,365
Thank you.

1271
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:06,742
Oh.

1272
01:19:08,536 --> 01:19:11,456
Did he ever say
why he made Harold?

1273
01:19:12,123 --> 01:19:13,416
Follow me.

1274
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:38,399
<i>Dear Harold,</i>

1275
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:42,904
<i>one day you might wanna know
why I made you.</i>

1276
01:19:42,904 --> 01:19:44,864
<i>In the beginning,
you were just a boy</i>

1277
01:19:44,864 --> 01:19:47,492
<i>with a purple crayon
and a blank page.</i>

1278
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:52,246
<i>I wanted to show folks
that with a little imagination,</i>

1279
01:19:52,246 --> 01:19:55,666
<i>you can make your life
whatever you want it to be.</i>

1280
01:19:59,045 --> 01:20:01,005
<i>I wanted you to inspire people</i>

1281
01:20:01,005 --> 01:20:03,424
<i>to live their lives
that way, too.</i>

1282
01:20:06,511 --> 01:20:09,222
<i>We only have
so much time in this world,</i>

1283
01:20:09,222 --> 01:20:12,767
<i>but we leave our mark
in the lives we change.</i>

1284
01:20:14,852 --> 01:20:19,023
<i>And I know you, Harold,
will keep inspiring our world...</i>

1285
01:20:22,276 --> 01:20:23,653
<i>one person at a time.</i>

1286
01:20:27,782 --> 01:20:31,118
<i>Because life isn't something
that just happens to you.</i>

1287
01:20:32,245 --> 01:20:33,412
Thank you.

1288
01:20:33,412 --> 01:20:35,373
<i>It's something you create.</i>

1289
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:38,292
<i>The trick...</i>

1290
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:41,128
<i>is in the imagining.</i>

1291
01:20:41,754 --> 01:20:42,838
I'll see you soon.

1292
01:20:52,139 --> 01:20:54,267
- All right, guys. Ready?
- Ready!

1293
01:20:54,267 --> 01:20:56,644
Moose? Moose, are you ready?

1294
01:20:56,644 --> 01:20:59,105
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm ready.

1295
01:20:59,105 --> 01:21:00,856
I was drawn ready.

1296
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:03,276
Come on, everybody!

1297
01:23:00,601 --> 01:23:03,396
Music as sweet
as a phoenix song.

1298
01:23:17,284 --> 01:23:18,411
Zerry.

1299
01:23:18,411 --> 01:23:19,995
O Warrior Queen.

1300
01:23:20,788 --> 01:23:22,373
I found you at last,

1301
01:23:22,373 --> 01:23:25,042
and nothing in the world
shall tear us asunder.

1302
01:23:25,042 --> 01:23:28,337
Oh, that's so flattering, Gar--

1303
01:23:28,337 --> 01:23:30,339
- Gagur--
- G'Garaur.

1304
01:23:30,339 --> 01:23:31,507
Gar-gar.

1305
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:33,300
But I'm seeing someone.

1306
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:38,055
Gondaldemor?

1307
01:23:41,684 --> 01:23:42,977
Good morrow.

1308
01:23:44,979 --> 01:23:46,063
Well, that's cool.

1309
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:48,899
I'm super busy anyway!
