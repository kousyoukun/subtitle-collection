Huh?

34
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:17,433

49
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,200
Oh.

50
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,700
Isn't that weird it's such
a long word, abbreviated.

51
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,067
Oh, my god.

52
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:10,967
I know you.

53
00:02:11,067 --> 00:02:12,433
Oh, oh, uh, I don't--

54
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:16,333
You did Scars at that
Silverlake church, didn't you?

55
00:02:16,433 --> 00:02:17,600
Oh, yeah.

56
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,667
You were amazing.

57
00:02:18,767 --> 00:02:20,233
Oh, thank you.

58
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:21,667
That's sweet, thanks.

59
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,233
Thank you.

60
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,400
I was like eight, and that show
made me want to be a dancer.

61
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,133
Eight?

62
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:28,300
You're such a star!

63
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,700
Hm.

64
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,300
Wow.

65
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,333
Tomorrow is my birthday.

66
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:37,233
Happy birthday.

67
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:42,700
You might still be here
the way this is going.

68
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,700
Thank you.

69
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:51,100
Uh, you can go ahead
of me if you want.

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,500
Shit.

00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:18,567
ROMY (VOICEOVER): Dear
David, You have always

72
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:21,933
asked me for the truth.

73
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:29,467
The truth is you're
still my best friend.

74
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:34,500
The truth is birthdays just
aren't the same without you.

75
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,967
Please come celebrate with me.

76
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:43,867
We will have your favorite
cake and this time

77
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:47,733
you can even wear
the purple hat.

78
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:52,767
But it's my last show tonight
and I need to leave by 5.

79
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:57,367
So get here in time, OK?

80
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:15,667
Funny how birthdays make
me think of you, David.

81
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:19,000
Then, again, everything does.

82
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:49,367
So here is another truth, the
truth is I miss us, David.

83
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:56,700
The truth is I was wrong.

84
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:07,667
Maybe I don't know what
the truth is anymore.

85
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:17,200
Maybe the truth just is.

Hey, honey, it's me.

Happy Birthday.

92
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:29,600
So I'm here at the
theater, you're not.

93
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,667
Multiple choice, what's
wrong with this picture?

94
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:35,800
Oh, my god, you guys actually
wear floss as a costume.

95
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,033
I wish my brain
could unknow this.

96
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:38,900
All right.

97
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,733
Well, call me back.

98
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:40,900

OK, I'm using my key.

105
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:06,733
Romy, I'm coming in.

106
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,300
I am traveling
through the house.

107
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,000
I know I'm late, but
I can't be that late.

Oh!

111
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:36,167
God damn it.

112
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:41,000
Son of a-- Hey, babe,
explain to me why at 36

113
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,833
I finally have my head
together but my body

114
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:43,933
is totally falling apart.

116
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,500
ROMY: Locked.

117
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,300
OK, well, this is
a little disturbing.

118
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,167
You're writing snail
mail instead of texting.

119
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:58,033
You have house plants that
are alive and can't be smoked.

120
00:08:58,133 --> 00:08:59,800
I hope you still have
visiting pigeons.

00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:06,033
Romy!

125
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:08,833
Romy!

126
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:10,467
ROMY: David?

127
00:09:10,567 --> 00:09:11,600
Yes

128
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,233
ROMY: If it all goes to
shit in the end anyway,

129
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,833
what makes this all worth it?

130
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,067
Honey, what happened?

131
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,367

00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:40,233
Hello?

134
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:50,500
Let me call Aaron.

135
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,267
OK?

136
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:54,700
ROMY: Sure, call everyone.

137
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,333
[ball bouncing]

00:09:57,433 --> 00:10:01,667
[phone ringing]

139
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,633
Hey, this is Aaron.

140
00:10:10,633 --> 00:10:11,400
OK.

141
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,467
I'll be there in
fifteen minutes.

142
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:17,133
I can't believe this
guy made it so far.

143
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:19,067
When I repped him he
would have meltdowns

144
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:20,300
over the weirdest things.

145
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,967
Like he would call
me at midnight

146
00:10:22,067 --> 00:10:23,900
sobbing because
he needed his meds

147
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,733
but refused to go
to the drugstore.

148
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,000
Why might he even do that?

149
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,667
He was upset because
sick people had

150
00:10:29,767 --> 00:10:31,967
to walk to the back of the
store but healthy people

151
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:34,867
could buy cigarettes up front.

152
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,000
Can you believe how
long ago that was?

153
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,200
When did we all meet?

154
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,267
2006.

155
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:43,233
Amazing.

156
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,600
What do we call
that decade anyway?

157
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,900
The aughts?

158
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,533
Zeros?

159
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:51,167
Seriously, that says
it all, doesn't it?

160
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:53,667
Thank you so much for coming.

161
00:10:53,767 --> 00:10:55,900
It's not fair.

162
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,833
She take drug like
breath mint and she still

163
00:10:58,933 --> 00:11:00,967
pure as driven slush.

164
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:01,567
Snow.

165
00:11:04,633 --> 00:11:06,800
Slush would be for fur.

166
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,567
I'm sorry it's been so long
since we've seen each other.

167
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:12,033
I missed you.

168
00:11:12,133 --> 00:11:14,467
How's Robert?

169
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:16,800
He's great.

170
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,500
So when is fashion week?

171
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,267
Maybe we should all
go somewhere instead.

172
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:24,367
God, that Paris flight
kills me every single time.

173
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:25,967
I would like to
punch you in teeth.

174
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:27,400
Oh, what?

175
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,200
Is this one on your
Transylvanian pearls of wisdom

176
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,533
where jet lag is
just in your mind

177
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:33,733
and if you lick a
clove of garlic--

178
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,467
Aaron, Hello?

179
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:36,667
Is that your brother?

180
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:37,967
Maybe we can get him to come.

181
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:38,733
How is he?

182
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:39,800
What's wrong.

183
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,667
Wait a minute, what?

184
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:41,600
Is there drama?

185
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,467
Excellent.

186
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:43,400
What is the crisis?

187
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,533

368
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:41,367
Champagne.

369
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,600
There we go.

370
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,400
Start talking.

371
00:20:54,100 --> 00:21:03,233
Marcus-- good booking,
non-committal, no condom,

372
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,467
never called me again.

373
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:14,233
And then Lance-- made a
fortune inheriting money.

374
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:18,600
And um, he told me he's
looking for somebody younger

375
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,233
and hotter.

376
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,100
Jerry gave me herpes.

377
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,067
Ted cheated on me
with his sister.

378
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:31,333
I'm like, are you kidding?

379
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:44,300
Peter, Seth, Barry, Josh,
John, Tom, Thomas-- and that's

380
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,033
in a year.

381
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,167
Sounds like a lot of
miscellaneous dicks.

382
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,100
That's a character
description not an appendage.

383
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,067
Thank you, Romy.

384
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,767
I always wanted what
you and Aaron had.

385
00:22:11,867 --> 00:22:14,833
AARON: You hate me, don't you?

386
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:16,900
Huh?

387
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,733
I don't know, I guess
I just always hoped

388
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:22,833
that somebody is going to come
along and make everything OK.

389
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:25,267
Nobody is going to
make everything OK.

390
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:27,067
You gotta do that for
yourself, you freak.

391
00:22:27,167 --> 00:22:30,133
I know that.

392
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:31,600
And I don't really know it.

393
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,567
You know?

394
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:33,467
No.

395
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:34,667
Yeah.

396
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:37,600
Whatever.

397
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,167
I don't know.

398
00:22:44,533 --> 00:22:45,167
Come here, you.

399
00:22:45,267 --> 00:22:46,233
It's going to be OK.

400
00:22:49,767 --> 00:22:51,000
It's going to be OK.

401
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,533
When was the last time
you washed your hair?

402
00:22:53,633 --> 00:22:54,533
11 days ago.

403
00:22:54,633 --> 00:22:54,967
It smells.

404
00:22:55,067 --> 00:22:55,867
I know.

405
00:22:55,967 --> 00:22:56,533
Thank you for coming.

406
00:22:56,633 --> 00:22:57,600
Of course.

407
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,567
I love you.

408
00:22:58,667 --> 00:22:59,300
I love you too.

409
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,833
Oh, how the fuck would
she know how grateful

410
00:23:03,933 --> 00:23:05,167
you are when every
single time you

411
00:23:05,267 --> 00:23:07,133
meet some random dude
you forget you even

412
00:23:07,233 --> 00:23:09,100
have friends until
that implodes.

413
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,700
And then you come
running back to us

414
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,533
to help put the pieces together.

415
00:23:12,633 --> 00:23:13,533
Fuck you.

416
00:23:13,633 --> 00:23:14,400
Fuck off.

417
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,300
You fuck off.

418
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,700
What is your problem with me?

419
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,000
How much time do you have?

420
00:23:24,633 --> 00:23:26,700
Were you born a dickhead?

421
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,233
You know what,
don't answer that.

422
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:29,833
That was a rhetorical question
for someone with a brain.

423
00:23:29,933 --> 00:23:31,333
Do you think anybody
is intelligent

424
00:23:31,433 --> 00:23:34,467
who fakes rapt attention,
any bullshit that spouts out

425
00:23:34,567 --> 00:23:35,867
of your stupid mouth.

426
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:37,800
Go plop on a shore
and start evolving.

427
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,733
Shut up, both of you.

428
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:39,867
Stop your bickering.

429
00:23:39,967 --> 00:23:40,667
I don't see what
the point is now.

430
00:23:40,767 --> 00:23:42,400
[screaming]

431
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:45,667
Stop.

432
00:23:49,033 --> 00:23:50,400
Whatever you're doing out there.

433
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:50,800
Just stop.

434
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,700
OK?

435
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,767
All right, fuck this.

436
00:23:52,867 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm calling an ambulance.

437
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,200
Romy?

438
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:04,767
Romy, where are your meds?

439
00:24:04,867 --> 00:24:07,733
Please stop.

440
00:24:10,633 --> 00:24:15,467
Yeah, how-- unbelievable,
they put me on hold.

441
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:16,000
Romy--

442
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,033
Please stop.

443
00:24:17,133 --> 00:24:18,133
Whatever you're doing out there.

444
00:24:18,233 --> 00:24:20,700
Just please stop.

445
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,300
OK.

446
00:24:24,433 --> 00:24:26,600
OK, we'll stop.

447
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,467
JESSICA: Aaron, the
number is 1-800-suicide.

448
00:24:30,567 --> 00:24:33,767
When you don't want to
live and you can't die.

449
00:24:33,867 --> 00:24:35,433
That's the dark side.

450
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,533
ROMY (CRYING): I just
need to be in here

451
00:24:40,633 --> 00:24:44,667
and I just need you guys
to be out there with me.

452
00:24:50,567 --> 00:24:53,033
Hey, Rom, babes?

453
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:54,733
(WHISPERING) I don't
want to be alone.

454
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,200
Just until it's light again.

455
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:00,833
OK?

456
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:02,500
Yeah, we'll stay.

457
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,333
OK?

458
00:25:03,433 --> 00:25:04,333
We'll stay as long as you need.

459
00:25:07,133 --> 00:25:09,533
[music playing]

460
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:13,200
Why do I love dance?

461
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,200
Because, to me,
life is movement.

462
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,767
In real life you know
your eyes are glued

463
00:25:22,867 --> 00:25:24,033
to the ground in front of you.

464
00:25:24,133 --> 00:25:28,067
But when you dance,
you have to look up.

465
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:29,233
You can't think anymore.

466
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:34,600
Your body takes
over, transforms you.

467
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,867
And it only exists
for the second

468
00:25:42,967 --> 00:25:48,300
that it's inside
your body and then it

469
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,567
lives forever in your memory.

470
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:53,733
Lets us know that we're
all a part of eternity.

471
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:14,300
I guess I just don't really
like reality that much.

472
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,233
I mean I don't know who
in their right mind does.

473
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:18,767
You know so when
I'm dancing I can

474
00:26:18,867 --> 00:26:20,367
pretend that it doesn't exist.

475
00:26:20,467 --> 00:26:23,833
And every time that I think that
I've closed the door on reality

476
00:26:23,933 --> 00:26:25,467
it comes in through the window.

477
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,433
Didn't you ever wish
for something more?

478
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,767
[screaming]

479
00:27:10,167 --> 00:27:14,033
Are you having panic fitella?

480
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:17,000
No, I'm so freaking dizzy.

481
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,600
What is this?

482
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,567
You know I think it's nice this
tradition you having birthday

483
00:27:22,667 --> 00:27:23,433
just the two of you.

484
00:27:23,533 --> 00:27:24,833
DAVID: Yeah, I know.

485
00:27:24,933 --> 00:27:26,600
Can you believe we've done this
every year for the last eight

486
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,567
years?

487
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:28,800
Let me get this straight.

488
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,767
So you just add or
take one tiny letter

489
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:33,133
and it changes everything?

490
00:27:33,233 --> 00:27:36,800
Yeah, like hepatitis
becomes hipatitis, which

491
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,167
describes terminal coolness.

492
00:27:40,267 --> 00:27:42,133
Yes.

493
00:27:42,233 --> 00:27:45,800
Forploy is when someone
misrepresents themselves

494
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,067
in order to get laid.

495
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:52,400
(LAUGHING) The scarecrow.

496
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,433
Um, Sarchasm is a gulf between
an author's sarcastic wit

497
00:27:57,533 --> 00:28:00,567
and the person that
doesn't quite get it.

498
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:01,467
I don't get it.

499
00:28:01,567 --> 00:28:04,033
I know, but you will.

500
00:28:04,133 --> 00:28:04,800
With your help.

501
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,767
With my help.

502
00:28:06,867 --> 00:28:08,433
So the real reason we're here.

503
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:10,667
Tavalodet moba--
Tavalodet mobarak.

504
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:12,100
ROMY: Tavalodet

505
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:12,867
DAVID: Tavalodet.

506
00:28:12,967 --> 00:28:13,900
ROMY: Mobarak.

507
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,100
DAVID: Tavalodet mobarak.

508
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,167
One year before year
2010th birthday.

509
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,733
You know Rage folded?

510
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:36,333
DAVID: Mm hm.

511
00:28:36,433 --> 00:28:38,533
And the world is missing yet
another angry underground

512
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:41,633
magazine where the editor
is passionately decrying

513
00:28:41,733 --> 00:28:44,100
the injustices of our society.

514
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,500
I think the world
is missing it.

515
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,267
Well, I don't.

516
00:28:49,367 --> 00:28:50,767
What's up with you, Ella?

517
00:28:50,867 --> 00:28:52,533
I don't know.

518
00:28:52,633 --> 00:28:55,600
I think it's the stress.

519
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,800
I'm just totally nauseous.

520
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,167
Just a sec.

521
00:29:00,633 --> 00:29:05,800
It's bad reason but it's
nice to be all together again.

522
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,633
Yeah, I know what you mean.

523
00:29:08,733 --> 00:29:10,967
How are things with Dad?

524
00:29:11,067 --> 00:29:13,633
You know how's working with him?

525
00:29:13,733 --> 00:29:15,767
He's fine.

526
00:29:15,867 --> 00:29:20,167
It's fine.

527
00:29:20,267 --> 00:29:21,533
It's called growing up.

528
00:29:23,433 --> 00:29:24,700
Used to call that giving up.

529
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,767
I don't care.

530
00:29:31,867 --> 00:29:34,567
Hey, if you're happy
I'm all for it.

531
00:29:34,667 --> 00:29:35,733
I'm just surprised.

532
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:38,100
Is Terrence dead yet?

533
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,133
Well, he probably isn't
given that with the money

534
00:29:40,233 --> 00:29:42,633
you've shuffled in based
on your warped genetics

535
00:29:42,733 --> 00:29:44,667
he could afford the
best shit while you guys

536
00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:46,733
were exploring your dark side.

537
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:53,067
Terrence died nine months ago.

538
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,200
Before I went to rehab.

539
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,533
I've been trying to tell you.

540
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,800
I finally did it.

541
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,400
I did it.

542
00:30:07,733 --> 00:30:09,100
I guess for his big [inaudible].

543
00:30:14,567 --> 00:30:17,700
So we had the memorial.

544
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,200
It was time.

545
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,833
OK.

546
00:30:25,933 --> 00:30:28,367
OK.

547
00:30:28,467 --> 00:30:32,000
Hey, Romy, can we
talk about Steve?

548

who are escaping violent homes

572

who are being dumped.

When you were working
together on our shoots?

731
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,800
How do I not know this?

732
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,233
You were too busy
changing worlds.

733
00:41:35,333 --> 00:41:37,200
I was busy making
models look pretty.

734
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:41,067
And Steve was busy doing models.

735
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:44,300
And then he tell me
he want to be buddies.

736
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,300
And I tell him, no,
it's not how it work.

737

you're not my buddy.

I think that is the most words
I've ever heard you say, Jaki.

742

Oh, and here's more.

743

preferred the less words.

anything to say anymore.

that I was passionate about.

That's true, but I
don't want her to.

she had worked three jobs

explain why you

the word I or me in it?

you're going through this time.

1087
01:01:38,733 --> 01:01:40,733
am into heavy petting
with inanimate objects?

1088
01:01:40,833 --> 01:01:42,067
Huh?

1089
01:01:42,167 --> 01:01:47,300
I actually hate those tiles.

1090
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:55,900
Do you know how long
we've been together now?

1091
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,667
I don't know.

1092
01:01:58,767 --> 01:02:06,100
Five years, nine months,
29 days, and 10 minutes.

1093
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Just so we are clear, I know.

1094
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,567
And it doesn't matter.

1095
01:02:20,667 --> 01:02:21,967
What?

1096
01:02:22,067 --> 01:02:23,967
It doesn't matter.

1097
01:02:24,067 --> 01:02:28,067
None of it mattered
to you and I'm still

1098
01:02:28,167 --> 01:02:29,267
here planning a wedding.

1099
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:38,833
So how do you know
that you matter?

1100
01:02:38,933 --> 01:02:42,200
I do because I can
see past your bullshit.

1101
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:52,733
You make me crazy, you make
me happy, and I love you.

1102
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:05,000
Just don't do it again, Romy, or
I'm going to have to kill you.

1103
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:07,600
[music playing]

1104
01:03:20,067 --> 01:03:21,933
I met you.

1105
01:03:22,033 --> 01:03:26,133
[music playing]

1106
01:03:39,367 --> 01:03:41,800
You should tell them
that you fucked the guy I

1107
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:43,467
loved with me in the next room.

1108
01:03:43,567 --> 01:03:46,467
Oh, yeah, that.

1109
01:03:46,567 --> 01:03:47,833
Yeah.

1110
01:03:47,933 --> 01:03:48,833
He's here.

1111
01:03:48,933 --> 01:03:50,400
Romy, he's here.

1112
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:51,467
He's here.

1113
01:03:51,567 --> 01:03:54,000
He is walking up the
driveway right now.

1114
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:56,167
He is walking up the driveway.

1115
01:03:56,267 --> 01:03:57,067
He looks so good.

1116
01:03:57,167 --> 01:03:59,500
OK, OK, honey, breathe.

1117
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:00,767
Hey, what's up?

1118
01:04:00,867 --> 01:04:01,533
Hi.

1119
01:04:01,633 --> 01:04:02,333
How's it going?

1120
01:04:02,433 --> 01:04:02,867
Good.

1121
01:04:02,967 --> 01:04:03,500
How are you?

1122
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:05,567
Good.

1123
01:04:05,667 --> 01:04:06,333
You look good.

1124
01:04:06,433 --> 01:04:06,767
Thanks.

1125
01:04:06,867 --> 01:04:07,967
You too.

1126
01:04:08,067 --> 01:04:08,733
ROMY (ON PHONE):
David, can you hear me?

1127
01:04:08,833 --> 01:04:09,500
Are you there?

1128
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:10,133
Oh, I'm sorry.

1129
01:04:10,233 --> 01:04:11,300
What did you say?

1130
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,467
I got to go so
just call me later.

1131
01:04:12,567 --> 01:04:13,700
OK.

1132
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,233
All right, bye.

1133
01:04:15,333 --> 01:04:15,633
OK.

1134
01:04:15,733 --> 01:04:16,233
Yep.

1135
01:04:32,633 --> 01:04:33,767
So who's this guy?

1136
01:04:33,867 --> 01:04:34,533
What's happening?

1137
01:04:34,633 --> 01:04:35,833
Why am I here?

1138
01:04:35,933 --> 01:04:40,333
Because I need you to tell
me what you think about him

1139
01:04:40,433 --> 01:04:41,533
OK.

1140
01:04:41,633 --> 01:04:43,267
DAVID: I have not felt
this way in like 10 years.

1141
01:04:43,367 --> 01:04:45,167
Not since that asshole who
shall remain nameless, James.

1142
01:04:45,267 --> 01:04:48,900
And I thought I liked it
like that, but I don't.

1143
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,167
I don't.

1144
01:04:50,267 --> 01:04:52,100
And I don't know,
it's like ever since I

1145
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,433
met Chris I just feel again.

1146
01:04:54,533 --> 01:04:56,400
And I love it.

1147
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:59,100
I feel like I'm waking up
to life again or something.

1148
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:02,967
Do you know what I mean?

1149
01:05:03,067 --> 01:05:04,900
Do you know what I mean?

1150
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:05,733
Yeah,

1151
01:05:05,833 --> 01:05:07,033
DAVID: Oh, my god.

1152
01:05:07,133 --> 01:05:10,333
I just-- I want him
to be my best friend.

1153
01:05:10,433 --> 01:05:11,467
He inspires me.

1154
01:05:11,567 --> 01:05:14,667
I want him to-- I just
want to be in his life.

1155
01:05:14,767 --> 01:05:16,600
I want him to be in my life.

1156
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:18,100
I want him to be my life.

1157
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,400
And can you please stop
giving me one word answers?

1158
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,233
Is that possible?

1159
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:24,633
OK.

1160
01:05:24,733 --> 01:05:27,200
[door rattling]

1161
01:05:28,067 --> 01:05:29,533
OK, you can come out now.

1162
01:05:29,633 --> 01:05:31,500
You've made your point.

1163
01:05:41,467 --> 01:05:43,900
[laughter]

1164
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,733
Does that count
that it goes up?

1165
01:05:45,833 --> 01:05:47,067
I guess so.

1166
01:05:47,167 --> 01:05:48,600
Yes, that's three
sevens in a row.

1167
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:52,633
Two, three, four, five,
six, seven, seven, seven.

1168
01:05:52,733 --> 01:05:54,400
You're so good at this.

1169
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:55,233
I know.

1170
01:05:55,333 --> 01:05:56,067
ROMY: You're so good at this.

1171
01:05:56,167 --> 01:05:57,133
I gotta go.

1172
01:05:57,233 --> 01:05:58,333
You have to go what?

1173
01:05:58,433 --> 01:05:58,900
Number two?

1174
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,333
I'm gonna go.

1175
01:06:00,433 --> 01:06:01,933
I got to go.

1176
01:06:02,033 --> 01:06:03,067
DAVID: You don't have to go.

1177
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:03,900
Yeah, I gotta go.

1178
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,100
DAVID: What, why?

1179
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,267
Why do you have to go?

1180
01:06:06,367 --> 01:06:08,100
ROMY: Because it's time to go.

1181
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:12,867
Oh, just, hang on.

1182
01:06:12,967 --> 01:06:14,067
No, no, no.

1183
01:06:14,167 --> 01:06:15,233
Please stay.

1184
01:06:15,333 --> 01:06:16,667
Please, please, will
you talk to him?

1185
01:06:16,767 --> 01:06:19,567
He's so nice to me but I
need to know more about him.

1186
01:06:19,667 --> 01:06:20,767
OK?

1187
01:06:20,867 --> 01:06:21,667
And he'll tell you
He'll talk to you.

1188
01:06:21,767 --> 01:06:22,567
Everybody talks to you.

1189
01:06:25,833 --> 01:06:29,700
I love you.

1190
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:33,867
Man, you really
tore my heart out

1191
01:06:33,967 --> 01:06:36,967
and stomped that sucker flat.

1192
01:06:37,067 --> 01:06:38,433
Why isn't Chris calling me?

1193
01:06:38,533 --> 01:06:39,867
Do you think-- you
know what I think?

1194
01:06:39,967 --> 01:06:40,833
I think I came-- I
come on too strong.

1195
01:06:40,933 --> 01:06:42,000
I did.

1196
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:42,933
You know I think
you should call him.

1197
01:06:43,033 --> 01:06:43,933
Yes, definitely.

1198
01:06:44,033 --> 01:06:45,167
You should call him for me.

1199
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:54,000
[phone ringing]

1200
01:06:55,867 --> 01:06:56,467
Answer it.

1201
01:06:56,567 --> 01:06:57,167
Answer it.

1202
01:06:57,267 --> 01:06:58,367
Answer it, answer it.

1203
01:06:58,467 --> 01:06:59,800
Please, please,
please, please, please.

1204
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:01,700
Answer it and tell
him to come see you.

1205
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:02,400
Tell him to see you.

1206
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:02,900
Answer it.

1207
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,500
Answer it.

1208
01:07:08,933 --> 01:07:13,567
How could you not know that
she was in love with you?

1209
01:07:32,867 --> 01:07:33,733
Look at you.

1210
01:07:33,833 --> 01:07:34,933
What is this fuzz?

1211
01:07:35,033 --> 01:07:36,333
When are you going
to learn to shave?

1212
01:07:36,433 --> 01:07:38,367
I would like to say its
fashion but it's laziness.

1213
01:07:38,467 --> 01:07:39,200
Look at you.

1214
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:39,967
Hi.

1215
01:07:40,067 --> 01:07:41,267
This is our friend Chris.

1216
01:07:41,367 --> 01:07:43,800
Oh!

1217
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:46,000
Could you be any cuter?

1218
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:49,767
Oh, gosh, look at you.

1219
01:07:49,867 --> 01:07:50,767
Come on.

1220
01:07:50,867 --> 01:07:51,733
Leave those.

1221
01:07:51,833 --> 01:07:52,733
Leave those.

1222
01:07:52,833 --> 01:07:54,100
It's OK.

1223
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:57,067
It is so nice to
finally meet you, Romy.

1224
01:07:57,167 --> 01:07:59,200
David has talked
so much about you

1225
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:02,000
and he never mentions
any of his girlfriends.

1226
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:03,367
Oh, really?

1227
01:08:03,467 --> 01:08:06,300
I mean his father and I
had almost given up hope.

1228
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:10,833
Wow, so you're still
not out to your parents?

1229
01:08:10,933 --> 01:08:13,833
I had no idea.

1230
01:08:13,933 --> 01:08:16,600
That explains so much about you.

1231
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:17,900
Oh, yeah?

1232
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,267
Like what?

1233
01:08:19,367 --> 01:08:22,567
Like why you don't have a life.

1234
01:08:22,667 --> 01:08:25,100
I mean it would take a lot
to clear that up for you.

1235
01:08:27,667 --> 01:08:29,200
Well, the night is young.

1236
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:32,867
Yes, but you're not.

1237
01:08:32,967 --> 01:08:35,767
That's good.

1238
01:08:35,867 --> 01:08:37,733
[laughing]

1239
01:08:40,767 --> 01:08:42,600
What are you saying?

1240
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:43,933
I'm not saying anything.

1241
01:08:44,033 --> 01:08:45,533
Do you have something
in your nose?

1242
01:08:45,633 --> 01:08:46,500
In my nose?

1243
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:47,100
Oh, come on.

1244
01:08:54,933 --> 01:08:56,767
Salty.

1245
01:08:56,867 --> 01:08:58,700
But it was good.

1246
01:09:03,067 --> 01:09:06,067
I loved Chris.

1247
01:09:06,167 --> 01:09:08,733
He had really clear
eyes, like a baby.

1248
01:09:08,833 --> 01:09:10,133
Aw, yes.

1249
01:09:10,233 --> 01:09:13,033
Like baby cow that lost mama.

1250
01:09:13,133 --> 01:09:15,100
Like Bambi.

1251
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,633
Yeah, there was just
no malice in them.

1252
01:09:16,733 --> 01:09:18,700
Wait, were you guys
all just sitting around

1253
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:19,900
staring into Chris's eyes?

1254
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,900
That's not creepy
to anybody but me?

1255
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:29,600
What was he like 12,
15, 18, one of those?

1256
01:09:32,433 --> 01:09:33,467
He was sweet.

1257
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:35,333
I think, I mean I only
met him the one time.

1258
01:09:35,433 --> 01:09:37,133
I don't know how
I'm hungry again.

1259
01:09:49,733 --> 01:09:52,433
You do not understand.

1260
01:09:52,533 --> 01:09:56,267
Just everything was starting
to fall apart, David.

1261
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:06,633
No, you just
found a good excuse

1262
01:10:06,733 --> 01:10:09,633
to do whatever you wanted
without any consideration

1263
01:10:09,733 --> 01:10:11,233
for me, for us.

1264
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:21,367
You know I will never
trust you again.

1265
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,033
You can't ever get that back.

1266
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:29,767
Oh, maybe I should just teach.

1267
01:10:29,867 --> 01:10:33,067
No, you love doing it too much.

1268
01:10:33,167 --> 01:10:36,433
Yeah, well, there's that.

1269
01:10:36,533 --> 01:10:37,400
Mm hm.

1270
01:10:45,733 --> 01:10:49,767
OK, he likes you, you like him.

1271
01:10:49,867 --> 01:10:50,833
Do whatever you want.

1272
01:10:50,933 --> 01:10:53,733
It's cool, I'm fine.

1273
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:54,633
Seriously.

1274
01:10:54,733 --> 01:10:55,233
Totally.

1275
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,533
I know it's getting
a little damp in here.

1276
01:11:07,333 --> 01:11:09,633
Why do you think they call
it happy hour when not one

1277
01:11:09,733 --> 01:11:11,967
person here looks happy?

1278
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:14,100
Hey, look at this
girl right here.

1279
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:15,467
Are you looking?

1280
01:11:21,833 --> 01:11:23,000
She looks happy though.

1281
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:24,200
No, she looks pretty happy.

1282
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:26,267
Yeah, but I'm
pretty sure there are

1283
01:11:26,367 --> 01:11:29,933
clowns out there thinking maybe
a little too much face paint.

1284
01:11:30,033 --> 01:11:31,400
I don't know.

1285
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:34,967
Maybe she was thinking better
well made-up then marked

1286
01:11:35,067 --> 01:11:36,167
for life.

1287
01:11:36,267 --> 01:11:40,233
Are you marked for life, Romy?

1288
01:11:40,333 --> 01:11:40,633
Yes.

1289
01:11:43,733 --> 01:11:45,000
Aren't we all?

1290
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:48,600
[music playing] That
it could last so long.

1291
01:11:52,867 --> 01:12:01,100
Every day that passes by, our
love it still stays strong.

1292
01:12:05,767 --> 01:12:14,000
How could I have known that
I would sing you this song?

1293
01:12:17,267 --> 01:12:18,333
Happy Anniversary.

1294
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:23,300
Happy Anniversary.

1295
01:12:32,733 --> 01:12:34,600
[sobbing]

1296
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:53,233
You know I think you had
every right to be angry,

1297
01:12:53,333 --> 01:12:56,333
but you had no
right to be cruel.

1298
01:13:06,133 --> 01:13:08,233
[snoring]

1299
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,467
[coughing]

1300
01:13:26,967 --> 01:13:27,467
Hey.

1301
01:13:32,333 --> 01:13:37,267
Six hours to think of something
to say and all you can think of

1302
01:13:37,367 --> 01:13:38,267
is hey.

1303
01:13:46,467 --> 01:13:47,600
Shit.

1304
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:48,933
David, what the fuck?

1305
01:13:49,033 --> 01:13:50,933
You said, you said that
this is what you wanted.

1306
01:13:51,033 --> 01:13:51,833
Yeah, right.

1307
01:13:51,933 --> 01:13:53,033
This is what you wanted.

1308
01:13:53,133 --> 01:13:54,167
It is not the same
thing that I want.

1309
01:13:54,267 --> 01:13:55,633
You said that I should do this.

1310
01:13:55,733 --> 01:13:56,900
You said thing you were fine.

1311
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,367
Yeah, OK.

1312
01:13:58,467 --> 01:14:01,333
Maybe I just thought you'd
have heart enough to care.

1313
01:14:01,433 --> 01:14:02,467
OK, OK.

1314
01:14:02,567 --> 01:14:03,833
So you say one thing,
expect me to understand

1315
01:14:03,933 --> 01:14:04,800
that it means something
else, and then

1316
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,200
you want me to do a third?

1317
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:08,733
What are you, like, the
fucking oracle of Delphi?

1318
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:15,700
Now what?

1319
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:33,400
So I don't know what's
going on with you guys

1320
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:39,333
but I want you to know that I
love you both very, very much.

1321
01:14:52,067 --> 01:14:56,500
These have, uh-- these
has been the best

1322
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:57,467
four months of my life.

1323
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:06,367
Basically, I don't know what
to do right now so I'm just

1324
01:15:06,467 --> 01:15:06,767
going to go.

1325
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:14,900
Don't fuck this up.

1326
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:15,533
OK?

1327
01:15:15,633 --> 01:15:16,500
Just go.

1328
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:21,633
Please, just go away.

1329
01:15:30,367 --> 01:15:32,600
I was talking to you, Romy.

1330
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:38,167
You're going to miss me.

1331
01:15:41,467 --> 01:15:44,400
How can I miss you if
you won't ever go away?

1332
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:46,400
[music playing]

1333
01:16:19,367 --> 01:16:20,800
Could somebody
get me some water?

1334
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:23,000
I feel like I'm
going to throw up.

1335
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:26,633
Congratulations, sweetheart.

1336
01:16:26,733 --> 01:16:29,267
You know you're pregnant, right?

1337
01:16:29,367 --> 01:16:30,600
No.

1338
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:32,867
Yeah.

1339
01:16:32,967 --> 01:16:33,567
No.

1340
01:16:33,667 --> 01:16:34,167
No.

1341
01:16:37,167 --> 01:16:39,567
Oh, my god.

1342
01:16:39,667 --> 01:16:41,100
Oh, my god.

1343
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,767
What am I going to do?

1344
01:16:47,867 --> 01:16:51,867
Well, you put
everything on hold

1345
01:16:51,967 --> 01:16:53,800
and make little person priority.

1346
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,333
And--

1347
01:16:55,433 --> 01:16:56,800
Find out that he thinks you
completely ruined his life.

1348
01:16:56,900 --> 01:17:00,833
And then wonder what
happened to yours?

1349
01:17:00,933 --> 01:17:06,733
Oh, David can be fun uncle who
take little person on protest

1350
01:17:06,833 --> 01:17:07,500
walks.

1351
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:09,167
DAVID: Oh, yeah.

1352
01:17:09,267 --> 01:17:11,133
I could take him
to football games

1353
01:17:11,233 --> 01:17:13,900
and teach him how
to play baseball.

1354
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,667
Man, you really
failed homo 101.

1355
01:17:17,767 --> 01:17:23,167
No fashion sense, hates interior
decorating, loves football.

1356
01:17:23,267 --> 01:17:24,333
I'm going to be a mom.

1357
01:17:26,933 --> 01:17:29,367
[music playing]

1358
01:17:38,433 --> 01:17:40,700
I gotta go.

1359
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:41,467
OK.

1360
01:17:41,567 --> 01:17:43,700
[music playing]

1361
01:18:14,067 --> 01:18:17,367
ROMY (VOICEOVER): I hope
you won't forget us.

1362
01:18:17,467 --> 01:18:20,567
And I hope you feel that
despite everything we

1363
01:18:20,667 --> 01:18:22,133
taught you something.

1364
01:18:28,033 --> 01:18:29,900
Important things.

1365
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,367
Like the reasons Prince is sexy.

1366
01:18:32,467 --> 01:18:35,900
That there is a difference
between cream, off-white,

1367
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,200
and ivory.

1368
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:40,367
That a salad with no
dressing, a diet coke,

1369
01:18:40,467 --> 01:18:42,667
and a hot fudge sundae
make a nutritious lunch.

1370
01:18:42,767 --> 01:18:47,700
Why a call between David and me
never lasts under 30 minutes.

1371
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:51,633
That crying can be fun.

1372
01:18:51,733 --> 01:18:54,633
And that we will miss you.

1373
01:19:11,567 --> 01:19:12,867
It's weird.

1374
01:19:12,967 --> 01:19:15,633
I've been looking for something
my whole life that makes sense

1375
01:19:15,733 --> 01:19:17,567
and now it's finally here.

1376
01:19:22,433 --> 01:19:22,733
What?

1377
01:19:25,333 --> 01:19:27,100
Do I have something on my face?

1378
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:30,233
You look happy.

1379
01:19:30,333 --> 01:19:32,533
I don't think I've
ever seen that before.

1380
01:19:37,067 --> 01:19:43,900
You didn't ever,
you know, love me?

1381
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,400
Before Romy, of course.

1382
01:19:51,633 --> 01:19:53,367
Even a teeny tiny bit?

1383
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:03,300
Not really.

1384
01:20:09,533 --> 01:20:15,700
It's funny, I always thought
that you were the answer

1385
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,500
I wasn't even the question.

1386
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:18,567
Mm.

1387
01:20:18,667 --> 01:20:22,200
[music playing] Hang
on to that feeling.

1388
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:26,100
Hang on to that feeling.

1389
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:31,200
Don't you ever let it slip away.

1390
01:20:48,633 --> 01:20:51,533
Hang on to that feeling.

1391
01:20:51,633 --> 01:20:54,900
Hang on to that feeling.

1392
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:00,100
Don't you ever let it slip away.

1393
01:21:17,267 --> 01:21:17,667
Bah!

1394
01:21:17,767 --> 01:21:18,367
Cockroach!

1395
01:21:18,467 --> 01:21:18,800
Cockroach!

1396
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:19,433
Where?

1397
01:21:19,533 --> 01:21:20,000
Where?

1398
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:20,767
What do we do?

1399
01:21:20,867 --> 01:21:21,500
Where's it at?

1400
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:22,000
Right there.

1401
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:22,700
I see it.

1402
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:23,400
I see it.

1403
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:23,833
I see it.

1404
01:21:23,933 --> 01:21:24,600
Oh, god.

1405
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:25,333
Did you get it.

1406
01:21:25,433 --> 01:21:25,900
Oh, my god.

1407
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:26,933
Look at this.

1408
01:21:27,033 --> 01:21:27,833
AARON: Is it Romy's old shit?

1409
01:21:27,933 --> 01:21:28,733
JESSICA: Look at this.

1410
01:21:28,833 --> 01:21:29,867
DAVID: It's you.

1411
01:21:29,967 --> 01:21:31,467
JESSICA: It's me,
my first cover.

1412
01:21:31,567 --> 01:21:32,767
AARON: Can I look at it?

1413
01:21:32,867 --> 01:21:34,367
DAVID: Roach killer.

1414
01:21:34,467 --> 01:21:37,100
JESSICA: Look at that,
your wedding announcement.

1415
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,833
AARON: Yeah, she's a
borderline hoarder.

1416
01:21:38,933 --> 01:21:40,767
JESSICA: Aaron.

1417
01:21:40,867 --> 01:21:42,800
Aw, look, when
Bernie had dignity.

1418
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:43,667
David Hamm.

1419
01:21:43,767 --> 01:21:44,700
Oh, my god.

1420
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,200
You can't make this up, can you?

1421
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:47,900
I think I'm going
to write about this.

1422
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,600
What, her armpits?

1423
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:51,267
Yes, Jessica, her armpits.

1424
01:21:51,367 --> 01:21:52,100
No!

1425
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:54,233
I mean this, tonight, all of us.

1426
01:21:54,333 --> 01:22:01,400
You, me, getting older, saving
a friend, saving the world.

1427
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:04,833
Hm, you're very
pretty, Jessica.

1428
01:22:04,933 --> 01:22:06,533
Thank you.

1429
01:22:06,633 --> 01:22:08,100
It's been mentioned.

1430
01:22:11,867 --> 01:22:13,100
Ella, how come
you've never asked

1431
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:16,700
me one question about
myself in seven years?

1432
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,333
Not one.

1433
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:22,600
Not how many brothers
and sisters I have.

1434
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:23,367
Where do I--

1435
01:22:23,467 --> 01:22:24,467
Brother-- Drew.

1436
01:22:24,567 --> 01:22:27,633
Assistant manager,
works at Geek Squad.

1437
01:22:27,733 --> 01:22:31,667
Your brother, Steve, he works
a DMV in North Carolina.

1438
01:22:31,767 --> 01:22:34,600
Your sister, Eleanor, she
started a pet nanny service

1439
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:37,300
to the stars in Atlanta
and then it went national.

1440
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:44,000
Well, it's Andrew and Steven.

1441
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:46,133
Not Drew and Steve.

1442
01:22:48,233 --> 01:22:49,700
What's the first
thing I said when

1443
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,733
