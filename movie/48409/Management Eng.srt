00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,611
- You're really good.

334
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,909
- You can't stay, Mike.

335
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,202
- Why not?

336
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,829
- 'Cause it's insane.

337
00:24:58,955 --> 00:24:59,914
l let you touch my butt,

338
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,708
and then you fly all the way
across the country.

339
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,544
- Well, it was much more
than a butt touch.

340
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,050
- Still, you can't stay.

341
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,594
l got a lot l got to do.

342
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,346
- Well, how much stuff
can you do in one night?

343
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,139
- A lot.

344
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,600
- Like what?

345
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,393
Do you go out with friends?

346
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,607
- Do you see that girl
over there?

347
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,359
She works
for Burger King.

348
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,569
She gives me vouchers
every week.

349
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,571
And l pass them out.

350
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,240
That's what l do.

351
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,749
- Hey.

352
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,460
l just want
to let you know,

353
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:49,004
if you want me
to leave tomorrow, l will.

354
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,257
l promise.

355
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,093
- Hey, guys.

356
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,929
- Sue's here.

357
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,013
- Okay.

358
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,348
Whopper.

359
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,308
- Yeah, sure, yeah.

360
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:02,601
- Whopper.

361
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,144
Whopper.

362
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,814
Whopper, Whopper.

363
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,941
Okay, chicken tenders.

364
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,734
Chicken tender.

365
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,822
Be careful,
easy, easy, easy, easy.

366
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,574
There you go, chicken tender.

367
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:21,662
Okay, BB-BK veggie burger.

368
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,998
- Fuck that, Sue.

369
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,083
- Come on, it's supposed
to be delicious.

370
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,167
- l don't think so.

371
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,377
- Come on, guys,
it's got soy in it.

372
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,921
lt's really-
it's really good.

373
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,132
- Fine, l'll take one.

374
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,341
- All right.

375
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:35,467
Hey, who wants a Powerade?

376
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,552
- l do
- l do.

377
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:37,678
- All right.

378
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,972
Got one there, buddy?

379
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:43,851
Oh, this is nice.

380
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,894
- Thanks, l've been here
two years.

381
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,028
Compact fluorescents.

382
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,946
- Oh, bummer.

383
00:26:56,072 --> 00:27:00,534
- No, that's-

384
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,870
So l think l'm gonna
go to sleep.

385
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,748
- Do you want me
to touch your butt first?

386
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:11,670
- No, l only do that
when l'm traveling.

387
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:16,967
- Right.

388
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:20,220
So do you-are you alone
here in Maryland,

389
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,097
or do you have relatives around?

390
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:24,600
- My mom is over in Laurel.

391
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:25,726
That-

392
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,061
Her name's Mary.

393
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,605
- Oh, what does she do?

394
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,483
- She sells insurance
to deaf people.

395
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:35,778
- Oh, nice sweat suit.

396
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:39,490
- [chuckles]

397
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:42,785
l don't-you know, l don't want
you to take this the wrong way,

398
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:47,122
but l think we probably
shouldn't sleep in the same bed.

399
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:48,248
- That's a good call.

400
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,952
- So is your return ticket
all set?

401
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,205
- l actually don't have one.

402
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:12,791
- You don't have
a return ticket?

403
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,209
- No, l bought a one-way.

404
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,086
- Why?
- Um...

405
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,796
- That's completely
unacceptable, Mike.

406
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:18,881
- l know.

407
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,007
- You need to buy one.

408
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,425
- l know.
l'm sorry.

409
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,469
l-l didn't have
enough money.

410
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,678
- What?

411
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,139
- l only had enough
for a one-way,

412
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:31,393
and l thought-l thought,
"l'm just gonna go for it."

413
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,480
- With me?
- Yes.

414
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,898
lt was
a far-flung notion.

415
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,025
- lt was a fucking
stupid notion.

416
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,276
- l guess.

417
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:41,153
- l'll lend you the money.

418
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,155
- No, you don't have to do that.
- Well, l'm going to.

419
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,074
- Okay, hey,
would you first consider

420
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,910
taking the morning off
from work?

421
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,161
- No.

422
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,205
- We could hang out,
and then l'll leave.

423
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,791
lf l don't, you can mace me.

424
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,417
- You're insane.

425
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:56,543
- We could go to the zoo.

426
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:57,628
That'd be fun.

427
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:00,130
- Mike, zoos suck.

428
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:02,090
- Okay, then we'll
do something else.

429
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,926
Come on, Sue,
take the day off from work.

430
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,469
You look like you could use it.

431
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,807
- l do?

432
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,725
- No, hey!

433
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,317
[voices overlapping]

434
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,486
- Bump something!

435
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,987
Bump those people.

436
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,447
Wait, wait, wait.

437
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,782
Give it to me.

438
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,784
- Not too hard, okay?

439
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,828
All right.

440
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,037
Oh, man.

441
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,919
- You shouldn't smoke.

442
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,712
- l'm done forever.
l'm serious.

443
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,131
- No, you don't-
hey, you don't have to-

444
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,216
You didn't have to do that.

445
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,300
- l know, but l am.

446
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,219
l'm done.

447
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:50,138
lt's time.

448
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,266
- Let me see
if l understand something.

449
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,852
Do you think that you, like,
like me, Mike?

450
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,562
- Yes.

451
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,564
- Why?

452
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,941
- 'Cause you have style.

453
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,276
- No, l don't.
- Yeah, you do.

454
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,777
- No, no, l don't.

455
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,404
- Yeah.

456
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,658
You-you give away 30%
of your income.

457
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:12,619
- You would too
if you made more.

458
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,955
- No, l wouldn't.

459
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:20,794
You're also
incredibly sweet.

460
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,505
Well, beneath, you know.

461
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,844
- Beneath what?

462
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,139
- Beneath the part of you
that's not.

463
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,146
- You better catch your bus.

464
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,029
- l'll pay you back
for the ticket.

465
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:51,575
- Don't worry about it.

466
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:54,786
- So will l ever
see you again?

467
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,496
- l wouldn't be
good for you, Mike.

468
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:57,581
l'm not good with people.

469
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:58,790
- No, that's not true.

470
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,167
- Yeah, no, it is.

471
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,960
- No, it's not.

472
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,629
What about
those homeless guys?

473
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,548
They love you.

474
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:12,054
What about the soccer gals?

475
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,723
What about me?

476
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,200
- Okay, buddy,
all aboard.

477
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,831
- l think, Mike,
you'd better get on the bus.

478
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:29,464
- Hey, Sue,
it's Mike calling again.

479
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,632
l'm trying not to call too much,

480
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:33,301
but l just want to make sure
that you got the poem

481
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,553
that l sent last week,

482
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:38,015
you know, the sort of elongated
haiku thing.

483
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:42,227
Anyway, you know my home number
and of course the front desk.

484
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,478
But seriously, you should call,

485
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,856
because l'm-
l'm definitely around.

486
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,774
Anyway, talk to you later,
l hope.

487
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,234

498
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,083

499
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,089
What are you doing here?

500
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,508
- Work.

501
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:59,679
- Hey, did-did you get
my haiku?

502
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,099
- The elongated one?

503
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:08,105
- Yeah.

504
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,481
lt was nice.

505
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:14,528
- So you're just
passing through?

506
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,029
- Yeah.

507
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:18,198
l fly out
from Phoenix tomorrow.

508
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,574
- Oh, okay.

509
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,077
- l'll take that.
- Oh, thank you.

510
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,996
- So this must be a really,
you know,

511
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,624
good region
for corporate art sales.

512
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,335
- Yes, it is.

513
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,461
- Good.

514
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:39,803
Hey, l'm supposed to go to this
yoga class thing later.

515
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,430
Would you like
to come with me?

516
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,329
Do you have
a boyfriend, Sue?

517
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:07,914
- No.

518
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,000
- Did you recently?

519
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,460
- Yes.

520
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,462
- What was his name?

521
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,883
- Jango.

522
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,092
He's an ex-punk.

523
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:21,011
- Ex-like, an ex-punk?

524
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,680
- Ex-rock punk.

525
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:26,141
We broke up
when he moved away.

526
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,393
- Why'd he leave?

527
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,437
- To open
the Pacific Northwest branch

528
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:33,398
of his organic
yogurt company.

529
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:34,482
He's the president.

530
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:35,609
- There you go.

531
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:38,320
- Thank you.

532
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,530
- Thanks.

533
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,699
So how's yourjob
these days?

534
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:43,992
- lt's okay.

535
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:46,494
- But it's not
your fantasyjob.

536
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,747
- l don't really
do fantasy, Mike.

537
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,624
- lf you could close your eyes
and pick anything,

538
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,750
what would it be?

539
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,960
- Uh...

540
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,128
- But you got to close
your eyes.

541
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,254
Otherwise,
it's not gonna work.

542
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,589
- Oh, okay.

543
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:02,052
Okay.

544
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:05,013
To run a full-service,
state-of-the-art soup kitchen.

545
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,223
- Wow.

546
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,892
- Multiple housing
units upstairs,

547
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:12,354
recreational facilities
in the basement,

548
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,898
job outreach,
midnight basketball.

549
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,650
- Really good soup?
- Always.

550
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,569
Excellent soup,
first and foremost.

551
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,030
- What about kids?

552
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:23,281
You want to have kids?

553
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,117
- You know what
was really great

554
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,454
about that yoga class?

555
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,500
lt was the breathing stuff.

556
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,043
l don't do that.

557
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,253
- Breathe?

558
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:40,507
- There are days where
l have to instruct my heart

559
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:45,637
to request additional air.

560
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:49,266
And l have to tell myself,

561
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,850
"Breathe, Sue.

562
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,853
Just keep breathing."

563
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,024
Yes, l want kids.

564
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,402
- Were you not sure
when l asked?

565
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,700
- l just don't think
l've ever really been asked...

566
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,369
that way...

567
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,705
before.

568
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,374
- Can l ask
one more question?

569
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,418
And then l'm done,
l swear.

570
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,711
- What?

571
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,507
- Will you come visit my mom
with me on the way home?

572
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,843
She's sick, and l-

573
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:28,388
l promised l'd stop by.

574
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:30,807
- Here, these are for you.

575
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,476
There's a flower
show downtown.

576
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:37,772
- That's nice of you.

577
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:42,319
- Um, hey, Ma, Sue flew in from
Baltimore just this morning.

578
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,154
- What do you do, Sue?

579
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,616
- l sell corporate
decorative art.

580
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,951
- l've met you before.

581
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:52,287
- Yeah, you know,
she stayed at the motel, Ma.

582
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,371
That's how we met.

583
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,123
- And where are you
from originally?

584
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,792
- l'm from Columbia, Maryland.

585
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,753
- Do you come
from a good family?

586
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,339
- Uh...

587
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,007
No, not really.

588
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,760
- ls there something
specifically wrong

589
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,095
with your family?

590
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,264
- Well, my father lives
on an ashram

591
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,475
in Northern California.

592
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:18,938
Pretty much sums up
everything about him.

593
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,899
He once forgot to pick me up
from gymnastics

594
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,817
for an entire night.

595
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,319
- That's quite a lot
of somersaults.

596
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:27,197
- [laughs]

597
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,698
- l didn't care.

598
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:31,117
lt reallyjust explains
more about him

599
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:34,579
than it does me.

600
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,082
- [coughs]

601
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,793
Could you hand me
those pills, Mike?

602
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:40,877
- Which ones?

603
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:44,255
- The ones on the left there.

604
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:53,640
Can l talk to my son in private
for a moment?

605
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:56,684
- Yeah, l-
Did l say something wrong?

606
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,561
- Not at all.

607
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,022
- l'll just be a moment.

608
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,484
- Okay.

609
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:12,867
- l like her.

610
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:15,161
- Really?

611
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:19,040
- She's a bit
of a long shot.

612
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,458
But she's logical

613
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:24,254
in an emotionally annihilated
kind of way.

614
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,339
But that's okay.

615
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:29,551
Underneath,
there's a heart of-

616
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:30,677
- Gold?

617
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,053
- No, l wouldn't say gold.

618
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:34,097
Maybe made of...

619
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,682
leather.

620
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,770
But if it works out,

621
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,397
she'll be good for you
when l'm gone.

622
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,899
Needless to say,
what would make me happy

623
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:48,403
is for you to find something
for yourself

624
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,821
before my checkout time,

625
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,449
just so l know it's not

626
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:56,619
you and your father alone here,
walking around like robots.

627
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,663
- Ma, Dad's not a robot.

628
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,165
- He is.

629
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:05,587
But l was mostly talking
about you...

630
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,214
unless you find
a way out.

631
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,299
- Of what?

632
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:12,135
- Of whatever it is
you're stuck in.

633
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,683
You get it from your father.

634
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:22,395
He came back
from the war stuck.

635
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:25,356
Been talking about
joining a gym ever since.

636
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:29,277
Never has.

637
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:34,616
But that doesn't
have to be you.

638
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,084
- You okay?

639
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,337
- Yeah, are you?

640
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:50,632
- Yeah.

641
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,634
- She liked you.

642
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,760
- No, she didn't.

643
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,553
- Yeah, she did.

644
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,223
She told me.

645
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:14,280
- What took you so long?

646
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:20,203
- Dad, do you remember Sue?

647
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,414
- Hi.

648
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,542
There's a toilet overflowing
in 1 1 0.

649
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,794
- Okay.

650
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,088
- Got to get home to your mom.

651
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,668
- You really leaving?

652
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:10,295
- l have to.

653
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,880
- You can't do one more night?

654
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,174
- l have meetings
this afternoon in Seattle.

655
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,844
- Blow 'em off
and just stay for a while.

656
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,262
- lt's myjob.

657
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,388
- l know.

658
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,599
But, you know, you could get
a job around here.

659
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,559
- Where, Szechuan House?

660
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,228
- No.

661
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:28,438
l'm just saying that,
you know-

662
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:32,525
- Mike.

663
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:37,488
l don't know
how to say this.

664
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,575
This isn't gonna work.

665
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:44,203
l mean, l'll-l'll stop by
when l pass through.

666
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,705
- Come on,
what do you mean?

667
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,668
- l can't move from Baltimore

668
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,420
to live in
a corner double room

669
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:54,672
of your parents' motel.

670
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:01,679
l mean...

671
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,806
be serious.

672
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:10,271
l'm sorry.

673
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:13,024
l'll stay in better touch
this time.

674
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:16,027
- Yeah, whatever you say.

675
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:53,690
So this is where she wanted?

676
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:58,236
- Well, this used to be
all scrub.

677
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,487
She'd be cringing right now

678
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:02,448
if she knew
they were building here.

679
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:07,453
But l promised her
l'd do it.

680
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:15,795
- Yeah, it's still nice.

681
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:20,967
- l meant to give this
to you earlier.

682
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:24,011
lt's your mom's favorite
piece ofjewelry.

683
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,722
As you know,
she was a necklace woman.

684
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:28,433
She thought
you should have it.

685
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,684
Don't know why.

686
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,061
Wouldn't want you
to start wearing it,

687
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:36,649
but maybe you can find
some use for it, something.

688
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:37,775
- Thanks, Dad.

689
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:41,487
- Also had some guy call me,

690
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:43,030
wanted to buy the motel.

691
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,451
- You gonna do it?

692
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,535
- l doubt it.

693
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:50,621
May as well keep
running it.

694
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:51,956
But you can do
what you want, Mike,

695
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,166
you know, if you-

696
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:56,169
you want to leave.

697
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,341
- This ain't a half bad
hunk ofjunk.

698
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:26,592
- Yeah, it was my mother's.

699
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:29,637
- Oh, God, let's not go down
the sentimental road.

700
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:30,930
- Oh, l'm not.
l'm just saying.

701
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,223
- Yeah, l know
what you're saying,

702
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,683
and l know
you're gonna start crying.

703
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:34,976
- What?
No, l'm not.

704
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,603
- How long you been
in the pawn business?

705
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:39,021
- The porn business?

706
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:40,815
- No, the pawn business,
God damn it.

707
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,109
How long you been
in the pawn business?

708
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,903
- Oh, no, l'm never-
l'm not in that.

709
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,280
- No, no, exactly.

710
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,574
So when somebody says
they ain't gonna start crying,

711
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,826
that's sure as shit sign

712
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:54,787
that they's just about
to start blubbering like a calf.

713
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,504
Oh, see what l mean?

714
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:06,841
- Just, how much
for the necklace?

715
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,846
- l'll give you $300.

716
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:14,807
- Okay.

717
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,398
- Oh.

718
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:24,525
- Hi.

719
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:26,152

720
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:28,195
- Sue no longer works here.

721
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,947
- l'm sorry?

722
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,158

724
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,620
- State.

725
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:39,040
Her old boyfriend convinced her
to move out to Aberdeen,

726
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,917
showed up here with flowers,
first class plane tickets.

727
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:43,461
lt was very
Officer and a Gentleman.

728
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,893

00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:49,777

742
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,303

00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:25,813

- l do?
- Big time.

749
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:29,358
You can't work here
if you stink.

750
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:31,277
lt's my parents' place,
and they're old school.

751
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:32,486
They really hate stinky people.

752
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:33,863
- Okay.

753
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:37,033

- Really?

757
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:48,002
- He also needs
a place to live.

758
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:50,504
So l was thinking
that maybe we could, you know,

759
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:51,881
let him stay in the basement

760
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:54,050
and deduct some rent
from his pay.

761
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:59,889
- [speaking foreign language]

762
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,642

00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:10,608
lt really means a lot.

765
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,693
- Dude, no problem, man.

766
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:14,278
You know, l've been trying
to get my folks

767
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:15,571
to hire someone American anyway,

768
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:17,490
'cause we catch less
bigot bullshit that way.

769
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,533
Plus, l freakin' hate
working the mornings.

770
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:21,160
- Why?

771
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:23,120
- 'Cause l smoke a lot of pot,
and l like sleeping in.

772
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:25,122
- That's cool.

773
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,500
- So why'd you come
to Aberdeen, Mike?

774
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,711
- This girl
that l'm in love with,

775
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:33,297
she moved here
to be with her ex-boyfriend.

776
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,843
- Oh, that sucks, man.

777
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:41,472
- Yeah, especially considering
the guy's a punk.

778
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,808
- Like, a punk punk?

779
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,059
- Ex-punk.

780
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,268
l think he's older now.

781
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:50,397
- Does he train dogs?

782
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:51,649

783
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,943

- ls he a punk?
- No, he's an ex-punk.

787
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:04,787
- So the thing
with this guy is, right?

788
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,831
He's also, like,
a yogurt magnate.

789
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,541
Okay, totally huge
in the yogurt business.

790
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,918
This guy's, like,
a yogurt fucking mogul.

791
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:13,087
You see those kennels
over there?

792
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,840
That's where he
keeps the dogs.

793
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,758
- Damn it.
- What?

794
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:18,884
- This guy-

795
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,761
this guy is, like,
a total stud.

796
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:21,887
- What do you mean?

797
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:25,141
- l'm not a sexual superman.

798
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:26,600
This guy?

799
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:27,685
l mean...

800
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,562
- No, dude,
you're probably fine.

801
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:30,646
- You're just saying that.

802
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:32,439
- Yeah, that's true,
but what do you want me to say,

803
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:33,566
that you're right?

804
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:34,650
- No, but-

805
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:35,776
- Okay, look, look,

806
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,945
chicks these days,
they don't want sexual supermen.

807
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:41,740
Okay, they want hard workers,
you know, guys who hustle.

808
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,200
And l mean, you look like
a hustler, Mike.

809
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:46,370
l mean, you came all the way out
to Aberdeen, dude,

810
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,164
and that's got to count
for something, right?

811
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,541
Yeah.
- Yeah.

812
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:53,085
- This guy's got shrubbery
shaped like pit bulls.

813
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:02,428
[dogs barking]

814
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:34,960
Dude, l think l got an idea

815
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:36,962
for how you can
get your girl back.

816
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:38,047
- Really?

817
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,007
- See that dude
sitting over there?

818
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:43,219
He runs a flight school
in Olympia.

819
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:45,512
You should
talk to him, Mike.

820
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:52,853
- Okay, Mike.

821
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:56,023
What l need now is for you
to free your mind

822
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:58,734
so as to have
a spiritually fulfilling,

823
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,903
religious fucking moment.

824
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:03,530
- l'm pretty sure
l can do it, Stan.

825
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,574
- That's the Michael
l've come to know

826
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,451
over the last
eight hours.

827
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:08,577
That's the Mike.

828
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:13,165
Come on, now.

829
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:24,802
Three, two, one.

830
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,178
- Wait, one sec!

831
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:29,306
[screams]

832
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,729
- Yeah.

833
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,566
(Stan)
Okay, now, Mike.

834
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:42,027
You're on your own!

835
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:56,792
- [screaming]

836
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:58,627
Whoo!

837
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:01,046
[screaming]

838
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:11,640
[Mike screaming]

839
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:13,434
- Jesus!

840
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,601
Oh, my God!

841
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:18,939
Jango!

842
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:20,399
Oh, my God.

843
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:21,775
Who is-who is that?

844
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:23,444
- Sue, it's me, Mike.

845
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:25,446
- Mike?

846
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:26,822
- Sue!

847
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:28,115
- What are you doing?

848
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:29,491
Mike, come here.

849
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,285
[silenced gunshots]

850
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:32,369
Jango, stop with the BBs!

851
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,495
l know him.

852
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:35,664
- What the fuck's going on?

853
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:37,666
- Come here.
Mike, come here.

854
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:38,917
Jango, stop shooting people.

855
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:40,002
Stop it.

856
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,128
Come here to me.
Follow my hands.

857
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:42,254
Follow the noise.

858
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,006
[gunshots]
Stop it!

859
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:45,215
Come on.

860
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:46,675
There you go.
Here l am.

861
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:48,969
l got you.
l got you.

862
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,304
Why?

863
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:52,139
Oh, my God,
are you okay?

864
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:53,265
- Back away.

865
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:54,350
Sue.

866
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:55,476
- Jango, give me the gun.

867
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:56,560
Give me the damn gun.

868
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,312
- l think l'm dying.
- lt's just BBs.

869
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,230
- No, l mean,
l really think l'm dying.

870
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:01,732
- Move back, Sue.

871
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,692
Clear.
- Ow!

872
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:04,818
- Jango!

873
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:06,737
What are you doing?
- CPR!

874
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:09,156
- Oh, my God,
l'm calling an ambulance.

875
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:10,699
Okay.

876
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:13,327
Well, thatjust looks like
you're kissing him, Jango.

877
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:34,390
- Hi.

878
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:36,433
- Where am l?

879
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,018
- The Aberdeen Medical Center.

880
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:41,146
[slurping]

881
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:43,774
- Did-did-

882
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,567
- Yeah, Jango shot you,

883
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:49,154
which caused you
to go into shock.

884
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:54,326
Mike, why?

885
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:57,913
Why did you come out here?

886
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:00,666
- Because l love you.

887
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:07,756
Do l have BB holes
in my neck?

888
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:08,882
- Yeah.

889
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,676
- They hurt.
- l can imagine.

890
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:15,222
- l thought it was over
with that guy.

891
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:17,933
- He's good to me, Mike.

892
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:21,270
He put me in charge of his
company's nonprofit yogurt fund,

893
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:24,606
which allows me to do a lot of
good things for a lot of people.

894
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:26,942
He also feels horrible
about shooting you,

895
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:30,612
and he would like
to have you over for dinner.

896
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:33,365
- Oh, that's nice.

897
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:39,746
- So who's this guy?

898
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,832
- That is...

899
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:44,209
me and Joe Strummer

900
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:47,588
in the summer of '79
at the 1 00 club in London.

901
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,339
- Who's Joe Strummer?

902
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:52,801
- Joe Strummer most likely
made love to your mother, Al,

903
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:54,720
and then wrote
a song about it.

904
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:55,846
Here's the two of us

905
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,639
throwing up together
at the CBGB's.

906
00:57:57,765 --> 00:58:00,893
- Hey, who is that?

907
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,102
- Oh.

908
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:03,479
That's me and Ed McMahon,

909
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:06,106
Ed Mc-wild-man.

910
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,318
Now, he's a true punk.

911
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:14,156
Basically, for me,
dog work is a thrill,

912
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:15,782
an adrenaline rush,
if you will,

913
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,367
that's otherwise
hard for me

914
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,495
to replicate
in the world of yogurt.

915
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:21,538
- Especially now
that you're not a punk.

916
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:25,918
- Well, l'll always be a punk
in here, Al, make no mistake.

917
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:29,463
But there's less need for me
to call myself a punk

918
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:32,716
in a world when the very notion
of punkdom

919
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:36,053
has been commodified
for the mass market.

920
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,137
- Okay.

921
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:38,889
- How do you like your marsala?

922
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,474
- lt's really good.

923
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,600
- Yeah?

924
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:44,061
- Oh, you're not gonna eat any?

925
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,771
- No, l-l liquefied it.

926
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:48,190
Listen, l would just like
to formally

927
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:51,401
and quite sincerely apologize
to you

928
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,987
for the BB gun incident.

929
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,197
l lost my cool.

930
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,573
l was scared for Sue,

931
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,283
scared for the dogs,

932
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:01,370
scared for the general
well-being of the pool.

933
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:03,455
So l just want to say
that l'm-

934
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:05,707
l'm sorry, M-

935
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:06,833
- Mike.

936
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,504
- My friend. l blundered.

937
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,172
- Yeah, that's all right.

938
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:15,926
- Yeah, so now that's
behind us.

939
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:18,387
And Sue tells me
that-that you're a painter.

940
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:20,013
[Sue clears throat]

941
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:21,431
- Yeah, very...

942
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:24,142
very talented painter.

943
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:25,811
- When did you have
the opportunity

944
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:27,980
to become acquainted
with his work, Sue?

945
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:31,858
- That was-it was my
last business trip

946
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:33,902
for Corporate Bliss.

947
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:35,028
- Hmm.

948
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:38,448
And you saw her
and thought,

949
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:42,452
"Great opportunity
to promote my art,"

950
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:45,747
or you thought,
"Beautiful woman"?

951
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:50,043
- The first part-one-
the art one.

952
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:52,087
- Now, and so you're the guy

953
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:55,924
who paints foxes and hounds
for corporate art?

954
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:57,384
- Yeah.

955
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:59,303
- Okay, 'cause l've got
something to say about that.

956
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,888
You take a Rottweiler-

957
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:05,976
well, no, let's say
a Malinois chasing a fox,

958
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,687
you got a seriously
new dynamic on your hands,

959
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:10,272
because a Malinois

960
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:12,024
on a fox's ass,

961
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:14,568
that'd be a trip,

962
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:18,572
because a Malinois is gonna
turn that little fox

963
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:21,366
into fox meat
inside of 23 seconds.

964
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:22,659
You know what l'm saying?

965
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:25,120
So l'd just like to lobby
for that a little bit.

966
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:26,246
- Okay.

967
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:28,081
- That was really
great chicken, Jango.

968
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:29,791
- l love that fucking chicken,
Jango.

969
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:32,419
- Oh, hey, you had
better chicken than that,

970
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:33,920
you'd have to be
a rooster.

971
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:37,049
[laughter]

972
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,968
Oh, hey, speaking of,

973
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:41,261
who's up for some dessert?

974
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:42,554
- Wow.

975
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,140
- Got a new flavor l want
to try out on you guys,

976
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:48,810
Henry Rollins
Chicken Wing Crunch.

977
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:52,648
- Hey, Sue.

978
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:55,108
Mike and l are gonna go
to the cowboy club after this,

979
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:56,818
and if you want to join us,
you know,

980
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:58,570
they got
really great dancing.

981
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:02,616
- l'll think about it.

982
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:09,873
- What l'm trying to say

983
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:13,043
is that China is not only gonna
kick America's economic butt,

984
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:14,711
but is gonna invade
your whole country.

985
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:16,254
l am talking
about you guys getting,

986
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:17,631
like, a whole new flag
and whatnot.

- To take care
of yourself a little...

1118
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:24,432
so that the people
who love you

1119
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:26,392
don't feel like
they're annoying you.

just marry me, okay?

for a half second
and just see what happens,

l'm getting married.

Mike, l can't afford
to be selfish on this one.

- Yeah, they're probably waiting
till yogurt season's over.

1149
01:11:48,512 --> 01:11:49,512
You're gonna be all right.

1150
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:52,682
- Yeah, yeah.

1151
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:56,561
l just want to say, Al...

1152
01:12:00,941 --> 01:12:03,067
You're the best friend
l ever had.

1153
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:05,820
- Ditto.

1154
01:12:14,955 --> 01:12:16,831
What a douchebag, huh?

1155
01:12:16,957 --> 01:12:21,210
[cheers and applause]

1156
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:25,298
You know, it's enough to make
you want to be a Buddhist monk.

1157
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:27,216
My people are really good
at that stuff.

1158
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:30,011
- Yeah?

1159
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:39,479
- No, dude,
don't get carried away.

1160
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:44,150
- d Well, l don't know
what l'm looking for d

1161
01:12:44,276 --> 01:12:46,277
- Oh, sure.

1162
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:51,115
- And you can see
by our next slide-

1163
01:12:54,161 --> 01:12:56,579
- d For some people,
it's an easy choice d

1164
01:12:56,705 --> 01:13:01,292
d But for me, there's a devil
and an angel's voice d

1165
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:04,045
d Well, l don't know
what l am looking for d

1166
01:13:04,171 --> 01:13:10,134
d But l know that l just
want to look some more d

1167
01:13:14,139 --> 01:13:16,682
d Well, l don't know
what l'm looking for d

1168
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:21,187
d But l know that l just
want to look some more d

1169
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:23,189
d And you hear it
from the strangers d

1170
01:13:23,315 --> 01:13:24,941
d and you hear it from friends d

1171
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:26,651
d that love never dies d

1172
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:28,152
- lt's one point.
Don't worry about it.

1173
01:13:28,278 --> 01:13:29,237
Now, serve the ball.

1174
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:30,446
You got it.

1175
01:13:33,158 --> 01:13:35,660
Come on!

1176
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:38,329
- d Well, l don't know
what l am living for d

1177
01:13:38,455 --> 01:13:43,459
d But l know that l just
want to live some more d

1178
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:55,138
- Michael, the progress you've
made in your four months here

1179
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:56,722
has been remarkable.

1180
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:58,224
- Thank you, Father.

1181
01:13:58,350 --> 01:13:59,725
- Needless to say,
your immersion

1182
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:01,853
in the duty of carrot chopper

1183
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:05,356
and broom chief
has been full and complete.

1184
01:14:05,482 --> 01:14:06,983
- Thank you.

1185
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:09,193
- But some worries
have arisen.

1186
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:10,736
- Such as what, Father?

1187
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:11,904
- Well, first of all,

1188
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:15,241
you're not supposed
to call me Father.

1189
01:14:15,367 --> 01:14:16,325
- Oh.

1190
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:18,870
- But l must say, l admit,
l've grown fond of it.

1191
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:22,081
Michael...

1192
01:14:22,207 --> 01:14:26,335
an aspiring bodhisattva
such as yourself

1193
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:30,131
should seek to produce a heart
that does not dwell.

1194
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:32,300
- Of course, father.

1195
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:37,054
- And your heart, Michael,
may l say, it does dwell.

1196
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:38,473
- No, it doesn't.

1197
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:39,640
- lt does, Michael.

1198
01:14:39,766 --> 01:14:43,436
You have not transcended
your earthly passions.

1199
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:48,107
To put it bluntly,
you are stuck.

1200
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:51,569
You also spend too much time
playing volleyball.

1201
01:14:51,695 --> 01:14:55,072
- Yeah, but l thought
that was permitted, Father.

1202
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:56,282
- Yes, but not
for seven hours a day.

1203
01:14:56,408 --> 01:15:00,077
- Also, you encouraged it
for stress release.

1204
01:15:00,204 --> 01:15:02,330
- Yes, l did, yes.

1205
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:04,165
But, Michael,

1206
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:06,584
Buddhist monks
aren't supposed to have

1207
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:10,213
seven hours a day
worth of stress.

1208
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:14,050
We are Buddhist monks,
Buddhist monks.

1209
01:15:18,555 --> 01:15:21,307
- So what should l do?

1210
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:24,977
- My parents died
when l was ten.

1211
01:15:25,103 --> 01:15:28,022
Two months later,
my uncle and l moved to America.

1212
01:15:28,148 --> 01:15:31,275
l was forced to let go
of everything l knew

1213
01:15:31,401 --> 01:15:34,278
in order to move on.

1214
01:15:34,404 --> 01:15:37,865
Sometimes in life,
you must do that.

1215
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:42,036
- Where are you from, Father?

1216
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:46,707
- Vietnam,
Hau Nghia Province.

1217
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:52,171
My parents were killed
in the war.

1218
01:15:52,297 --> 01:15:53,422
- By the Americans?

1219
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:56,008
- Yes.

1220
01:15:56,134 --> 01:15:57,468
And yet l moved here.

1221
01:15:58,762 --> 01:16:01,973
Life is odd.

1222
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:07,353
- l'm sorry.

1223
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:08,980
- No, no, no.

1224
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:12,608
lt is not your fault.

1225
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:15,861
Let go, Mike.

1226
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:19,240
Let go and move on.

1227
01:17:35,525 --> 01:17:36,984
- l recog-noodle you.

1228
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:38,944
- Yeah, l'm the guy who
sold you my mom's necklace.

1229
01:17:39,071 --> 01:17:41,656
- Oh, yeah, that's right.

1230
01:17:41,782 --> 01:17:43,324
What can l do you for?

1231
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:44,825
- l want it back.

1232
01:18:01,426 --> 01:18:02,593
Dad.

1233
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:05,346
Do you want me
to make you some dinner?

1234
01:18:05,472 --> 01:18:08,307
- No, l'm all right.

1235
01:18:08,433 --> 01:18:11,268
- Okay.

1236
01:18:19,152 --> 01:18:22,405
Dad, when you were over
in Vietnam,

1237
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:27,868
did you ever do any fighting
in the Hau Nghia Province?

1238
01:18:33,834 --> 01:18:36,252
- Yeah.

1239
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:38,129
Why?

1240
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,676
- l just met this guy
up at the monastery

1241
01:18:43,802 --> 01:18:47,596
who's from that area.

1242
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:50,391
He seemed to really
have his shit together.

1243
01:18:53,311 --> 01:18:55,813
- Good to hear.

1244
01:19:09,369 --> 01:19:10,327
- Dad, l've been thinking.

1245
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:12,121
Maybe you should
sell this place.

1246
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:15,332
You don't even
like it here.

1247
01:19:16,209 --> 01:19:17,626
This was Mom's thing.

1248
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:20,004
- Why do you say that?

1249
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:23,799
- 'Cause it's true.

1250
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:26,635
Come on, Mom loved people,
loved running things.

1251
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:28,095
lt's not like you.

1252
01:19:28,221 --> 01:19:30,598
You're not like
a people person, Dad.

1253
01:19:32,684 --> 01:19:35,352
You should let it go.

1254
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:37,480
Move on.

1255
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:38,939
Otherwise,
you're just gonna rot.

1256
01:19:39,065 --> 01:19:40,441
- Sell it and do what?

1257
01:19:40,567 --> 01:19:41,525
- Anything.

1258
01:19:41,651 --> 01:19:42,735
You still have time.

1259
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:43,861
You'd have money.

1260
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:47,948
- What do you need, Mike,
a loan?

1261
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:51,535
- No.

1262
01:19:51,661 --> 01:19:56,457
l just wanted to say that this
doesn't have to be it...

1263
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:02,671
And that l love you.

1264
01:20:24,486 --> 01:20:26,028
- "Dear Mike,

1265
01:20:26,154 --> 01:20:28,364
" l know you probably don't want
to hear from me,

1266
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:30,866
"and l can't say l blame you.

1267
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:33,994
"But l wanted to write anyway
to let you know what l think,

1268
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:37,998
"which is that l think
you had a point that day

1269
01:20:38,124 --> 01:20:41,001
"about people who hide
behind their causes

1270
01:20:41,127 --> 01:20:43,420
"in order to avoid their lives.

1271
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,552
"You had a point down there
in that basement,

1272
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:53,889
"with the soy sauce
and the mice.

1273
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:58,811
"And so l wanted to say thanks.

1274
01:20:58,937 --> 01:21:04,108
"Because of you, Mike,
l'm not the same person l was.

1275
01:21:04,234 --> 01:21:05,901
"Good-bye, Mike.

1276
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:08,195
Love, Sue."

1277
01:21:14,327 --> 01:21:17,162
- So l thought about
what you said the other day.

1278
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:23,043
l think you had a point.

1279
01:21:23,169 --> 01:21:26,380
That being said,
this is yours.

1280
01:21:27,757 --> 01:21:28,757
- What is it?

1281
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:31,760
- Deed to the motel,
signed over to you.

1282
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:37,182
- Dad, that's not-
that's not why-

1283
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:39,602
- lt's fine.

1284
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:42,813
l don't need it.

1285
01:21:42,939 --> 01:21:44,273
Your mom was good
about that.

1286
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:47,818
You-you can'tjust give me
the motel.

1287
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:50,070
- lt's your birthright.

1288
01:21:52,365 --> 01:21:54,241
- What would you do?

1289
01:21:54,367 --> 01:21:57,077
- l want to get in shape,

1290
01:21:57,203 --> 01:22:00,706
maybe join one of those
basketball leagues.

1291
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:04,543
How about you?

1292
01:22:04,669 --> 01:22:05,669
- l don't know.

1293
01:22:05,795 --> 01:22:09,006
l'll think of something.

1294
01:22:09,132 --> 01:22:10,215
- You done
with the monk stuff?

1295
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:14,553
- Yeah, l'll still
occasionally do it,

1296
01:22:14,679 --> 01:22:17,181
l mean,
not professionally, but-

1297
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:23,020
- What about that girl?

1298
01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:27,942
- Oh, that didn't work out.

1299
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:34,573
Yeah, we weren't, you know,
like, meant for each other.

1300
01:22:34,699 --> 01:22:37,910
- l don't know, Mike.

1301
01:22:38,036 --> 01:22:40,120
Things change in life.

1302
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:43,958
- What do you mean?

1303
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:46,418
- You're not
the same guy you were.

1304
01:22:54,594 --> 01:22:56,553
Good soup.

1305
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:03,352
