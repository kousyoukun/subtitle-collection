1
00:01:45,055 --> 00:01:48,286
Mike!

2
00:01:48,702 --> 00:01:50,791
Did you sweep the pool?

3
00:01:53,309 --> 00:01:56,843
Why? Because people wanna swim.

4
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:18,549
How are you feeling today, ma? Feeling great, Mike. Good.

5
00:02:20,694 --> 00:02:22,916
Where's dad? Crossword.

6
00:02:27,024 --> 00:02:31,162
Checking out of 202. How was your stay, Mr Edmunds?

7
00:02:31,163 --> 00:02:33,688
Fine, thanks. Thank you so much.

8
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,147
So two nights, preferably upstairs. Oh sure.

9
00:03:25,045 --> 00:03:26,525
Let's see, smoking or non smoking? Non smoking.

10
00:03:27,312 --> 00:03:30,106
I got you into 203. Okay.

11
00:03:30,107 --> 00:03:34,594
Nice room. Oh this is our snack bar, the prices are on the wall.

12
00:03:40,545 --> 00:03:41,365
Sorry.

13
00:03:42,774 --> 00:03:45,621
There you go. Thank you.

14
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:54,013
Anything else you should need, just give me a call. Thank you very much.

15
00:03:54,118 --> 00:03:56,943
Do you need help with your bags? No, I'm fine.

16
00:04:02,387 --> 00:04:06,319
110's called twice to complain that 111's making too much noise.

17
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,297
Yeah, what kind of noise? Not that kind of noise Mike, now get your mind out of the gutter.

18
00:04:12,236 --> 00:04:15,453
Apparently 111's got some sort of grinder in there.

19
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,651
I thought you said to get my mind out of the gutter? Don't be gross, Mike.

20
00:04:20,704 --> 00:04:23,694
Get some sleep, you look tired. I'm not tired.

21
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,385
You look tired. You're the one who's sick, ma.

22
00:04:27,293 --> 00:04:29,001
Now that's a nice thing to say.

23
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,937
Sorry. I love you.

24
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,626
Love you too. Good night, dad. All right.

25
00:05:37,955 --> 00:05:40,172
Who is it? Management.

26
00:05:41,687 --> 00:05:45,673
What? Management. Welcome gift.

27
00:05:53,911 --> 00:05:55,788
Hi. Hi.

28
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,367
I have your complimentary bottle...welcome gift.

29
00:06:01,332 --> 00:06:03,577
Wine. It's on the house.

30
00:06:04,962 --> 00:06:09,254
I'm uh, oh, Mike. And I am with management.

31
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:12,636
Nice to meet you, Mike. Oh it's...uh...my pleasure.

32
00:06:13,927 --> 00:06:18,615
So, where would you like it? You know what I can just, I can just take it.

33
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:21,118
Oh, okay.

34
00:06:21,904 --> 00:06:25,598
Do you uh, I'm sorry. Would you like me to open it? For you?

35
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,938
I mean. Yeah, cause sometimes guests don't have screws. Or, screws.

36
00:06:34,651 --> 00:06:37,232
Yeah, okay, sure.

37
00:06:38,195 --> 00:06:39,885
Just close this here.

38
00:06:43,043 --> 00:06:44,548
Thanks.

39
00:06:51,562 --> 00:06:53,695
Anything interesting tonight?

40
00:06:54,354 --> 00:06:56,535
I haven't really been paying attention.

41
00:06:57,814 --> 00:06:59,727
I know the feeling.

42
00:07:01,745 --> 00:07:04,885
You know, there should be cups in the bathroom.

43
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:26,129
Completely sanitary. That's good.

44
00:07:35,978 --> 00:07:38,380
Wine is delicious.

45
00:07:48,224 --> 00:07:49,435
Shall I?

46
00:07:50,265 --> 00:07:51,938
Okay, sure.

47
00:08:06,405 --> 00:08:07,868
Pretty good year.

48
00:08:08,202 --> 00:08:13,334
Sometimes guests like me to join in and have a taste.

49
00:08:13,335 --> 00:08:16,863
Is that right? Not always but...often.

50
00:08:17,653 --> 00:08:21,737
Should be another cup in the bathroom. I should get to work Mike, so...

51
00:08:21,738 --> 00:08:24,760
What do you do? I sell paintings.

52
00:08:24,761 --> 00:08:28,310
Really? I love paintings. What kind?

53
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:30,401
That kind.

54
00:08:32,357 --> 00:08:37,001
Oooooh. Nice. So that's what you're doing in town.

55
00:08:37,002 --> 00:08:39,808
I give presentations tomorrow and then I fly out the next morning.

56
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:44,085
What say...the company that you work for? It's called Corporate Bliss.

57
00:08:44,086 --> 00:08:48,228
And where you guys HQ? Maryland.

58
00:08:48,229 --> 00:08:52,431
Nice. Wait! 'Maryland, is for lovers'.

59
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,970
It's Virginia, actually 'Virginia is for lovers'.

60
00:08:56,471 --> 00:08:59,192
'Maryland is for crabs'. Yeah, you're right.

61
00:08:59,193 --> 00:09:02,656
Okay Mike... Okay, I gotta get back to work. Oh, solitary, great game.

62
00:09:03,837 --> 00:09:09,363
Okay, I'm gonna be down in the lobby till 11, then in my apartment after that.

63
00:09:09,364 --> 00:09:12,059
But I can always be reached by a front door buzzer. 

64
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,755
From then on. Just take it easy on your solitary problem.

65
00:09:14,756 --> 00:09:16,552
Yeah, have a great night. Good night!

66
00:09:41,192 --> 00:09:43,272
...laundry room and then I came down here into the lobby, 

67
00:09:43,591 --> 00:09:48,485
and that's when I realized that your establishment doesn't have any options for recycling.

68
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,151
You're absolutely right, we don't. Which I apologize for.

69
00:09:52,152 --> 00:09:53,271
It's something we're working on. 

70
00:09:54,238 --> 00:09:59,840
But as you may know the Kingman area has been a little slow to fully embrace the recycling issue.

71
00:10:00,452 --> 00:10:03,631
It's been voted on to... What should I do with this bottle?

72
00:10:04,841 --> 00:10:07,833
Well... I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude, 

73
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:11,057
but this is something that I'm just, I'm very passionate about.

74
00:10:11,058 --> 00:10:13,296
Recycling? Yes, recycling.

75
00:10:13,297 --> 00:10:15,042
Let me take it. I'll do it.

76
00:10:15,043 --> 00:10:19,512
I was gonna make a recycling round anyway.

77
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,567
Well, that's nice of you.

78
00:10:23,568 --> 00:10:27,836
This is my son Michael, he is the official night manager.

79
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:33,858
Thank you. It's very nice of you.

80
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:39,308
You bet. I'll just be out the back here with all my other ones.

81
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,319
I got a pretty good, big pile...

82
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:08,834
Who is it? Mike.

83
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,462
Oh god.

84
00:11:14,584 --> 00:11:17,665
Champagne. Why?

85
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:21,468
We give it to all our guests who stay for two nights.

86
00:11:22,055 --> 00:11:24,219
Wow, that's a pretty good deal.

87
00:11:24,219 --> 00:11:27,192
Did you and your mom come up with that on your own?

88
00:11:27,935 --> 00:11:29,975
So shall I?

89
00:11:31,931 --> 00:11:33,812
Why not?

90
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:45,243
Réserve. You know, they're always at the same place. The cups.

91
00:12:34,985 --> 00:12:36,447
Thank you.

92
00:12:37,144 --> 00:12:41,842
Do you make a toast, Mike? Hm, yeah, sure.

93
00:12:42,268 --> 00:12:44,607
You're Sue, right? Yeah.

94
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:49,985
Here's to...people being happy!

95
00:13:01,224 --> 00:13:03,429
How were your presentations today?

96
00:13:06,275 --> 00:13:07,852
Average.

97
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,963
You have a great butt.

98
00:13:18,751 --> 00:13:21,874
I noticed the moment you checked in and...

99
00:13:24,573 --> 00:13:25,917
Thank you.

100
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:30,750
Hope that isn't too, you know... No. I mean yeah, but...

101
00:13:31,358 --> 00:13:33,195
Thank you.

102
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:37,209
Do you do this a lot, Mike? No.

103
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,911
Sometimes? Fairly rarely.

104
00:13:39,912 --> 00:13:42,227
Does it ever work? Never.

105
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:46,745
What would constitute having it work?

106
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:51,812
Us having sex?

107
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:55,020
You getting to touch my butt?

108
00:13:56,934 --> 00:14:07,319
That would... Yeah, I'd consider that...fairly...constitution...

109
00:14:13,576 --> 00:14:15,245
Okay.

110
00:14:16,162 --> 00:14:20,429
You can touch my butt but then you gotta go.

111
00:14:36,231 --> 00:14:39,354
Okay. Are you serious?

112
00:14:39,355 --> 00:14:42,777
Yeah, touch it and go, Mike! Just touch and go.

113
00:15:08,244 --> 00:15:10,193
You're sure from Maryland? Yeah.

114
00:15:10,194 --> 00:15:13,301
Where about? Columbia. What about you?

115
00:15:13,302 --> 00:15:15,725
Here. Kingman.

116
00:15:18,398 --> 00:15:19,973
It's very warm.

117
00:15:24,113 --> 00:15:27,396
Okay, Mike. I got an early plane to catch and well... Yeah, me too.

118
00:15:27,873 --> 00:15:29,864
Bye bye now. Bye.

119
00:16:01,573 --> 00:16:07,966
Mom? Hi, it's me. I'm just checking in. I'm in Kingman, Arizona.

120
00:16:10,312 --> 00:16:15,309
Okay, that's it. I love you and I miss you. Okay.

121
00:16:45,284 --> 00:16:48,189
Hi Sue. Hi.

122
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:57,412
I was wondering if I could snag your cellphone number or your email before you left?

123
00:16:58,813 --> 00:17:02,321
I don't think so, Mike. Why not?

124
00:17:03,081 --> 00:17:04,961
Ah...not my style.

125
00:17:05,681 --> 00:17:10,473
But...we...you know, I uh, touched your butt.

126
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:14,549
I know. And it was nice.

127
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,078
I just think that's all she wrote.

128
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,337
That was...

129
00:19:01,876 --> 00:19:05,542
Mike, are those high boots? Yeah. You're not gonna get these off.

130
00:19:46,188 --> 00:19:52,222
You're all checked out? Yeah, I get it with your wife. Earlier.

131
00:20:01,112 --> 00:20:05,296
Hey, dad. Oh! Come back and see us some time.

132
00:20:05,297 --> 00:20:07,601
Mhm, yah, now you know it all depends on work.

133
00:20:30,544 --> 00:20:36,026
What was that all about? She sells motel paintings.

134
00:20:45,135 --> 00:20:48,909
Mike, the heat's out in 118.

135
00:21:19,536 --> 00:21:24,239
Thank you for calling Last Minute Flights. I'd like to book a... Your call is important to us... Fuck!

136
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:34,113
Please continue to hold. Your call will be answered in an orderly fashion...

137
00:21:34,114 --> 00:21:35,469
Okay Mike, now or never.

138
00:21:37,075 --> 00:21:41,194
I'm gonna do it! Hello, Last Minute Flights, how may I assist you?

139
00:21:42,513 --> 00:21:45,361
Hi! Yeah! I'd like to book a one way cash ticket 

140
00:21:45,362 --> 00:21:51,058
for as fast as possible from Phoenix to Baltimore. Got it?

141
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:43,344
Hi, I'm here to see Sue Claussen. Is she expecting you?

142
00:22:43,345 --> 00:22:47,581
Um yeah, I've left a couple of messages. Messages regarding...?

143
00:22:47,582 --> 00:22:51,383
Regarding Sue, telling her I was in town. I'm an old friend.

144
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:55,023
I see.

145
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:04,069
Sue, hi!

146
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:11,582
What are you doing here? I was wondering if we could talk.

147
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:16,887
Why are you here? I called twice, did you get the messages?

148
00:23:17,165 --> 00:23:20,429
You know what guys, I'm sorry, why don't you go ahead.

149
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,943
Are you sure, Sue? Yes, good, go.

150
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:25,030
Good.

151
00:23:29,691 --> 00:23:31,961
Can I talk to you for a second?

152
00:23:34,475 --> 00:23:36,776
This is completely inappropriate.

153
00:23:37,587 --> 00:23:39,602
This is like a violation.

154
00:23:39,603 --> 00:23:41,609
I wasn't trying to violate... Yes you did.

155
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:46,866
You are. You're violating my personal space, you're violating my personal life.

156
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:49,639
I can't do this, I have to be somewhere, I'm late.

157
00:23:49,967 --> 00:23:52,376
It's five o'clock what can you be late for?

158
00:23:52,377 --> 00:23:53,420
I have an event.

159
00:23:53,421 --> 00:23:56,688
You have an event? What kind of an event?

160
00:23:56,689 --> 00:23:58,955
I can't tell you.

161
00:23:59,692 --> 00:24:01,188
Can I come?

162
00:24:38,629 --> 00:24:41,146
Here. Come on you need it.

163
00:24:43,155 --> 00:24:46,703
You do this every week? Yeah.

164
00:24:47,246 --> 00:24:49,419
You're really good at it.

165
00:24:53,813 --> 00:24:56,578
You can't stay, Mike. Why not?

166
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:58,627
Cause it's insane.

167
00:24:58,628 --> 00:25:02,981
I let you touch my butt and then you fly halfway across the country.

168
00:25:02,982 --> 00:25:05,755
Well it was much more than a butt touch.

169
00:25:10,158 --> 00:25:13,431
Still you can't stay. I've got a lot of work to do.

170
00:25:13,432 --> 00:25:16,796
Well how much stuff can you do in one night? A lot.

171
00:25:17,355 --> 00:25:21,643
Like what? You got out with friends or...?

172
00:25:23,811 --> 00:25:26,077
You see that girl over there?

173
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,884
She works for Burger King. She gives me vouchers every week.

174
00:25:30,885 --> 00:25:32,735
And I pass them out.

175
00:25:32,736 --> 00:25:34,195
That's what I do.

176
00:25:43,726 --> 00:25:50,060
I just wanna let you know. If you want me to leave tomorrow, I will, I promise.

177
00:25:53,145 --> 00:25:56,408
Hey guys! Sue is here.

178
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:05,417
Whopper. Whopper. Whopper. Whopper. Whopper.

179
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:09,533
Okay, Chicken Tenders.

180
00:26:11,693 --> 00:26:14,617
Careful. Easy, easy, easy. Easy.

181
00:26:14,732 --> 00:26:17,046
Here you go, Chicken Tender.

182
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:20,635
Ok. BK veggie burger.

183
00:26:21,816 --> 00:26:25,749
Not that, Sue. Come on, it's supposed to be delicious.

184
00:26:26,381 --> 00:26:30,364
I don't think so... Come on guys, it's got soya in it, it's good, it's really good.

185
00:26:31,245 --> 00:26:33,625
Fine, I'll take one.

186
00:26:33,905 --> 00:26:35,727
All right, hey, who wants a powerade? All right.

187
00:26:43,087 --> 00:26:46,386
This is nice. Thanks. I've been here two years.

188
00:26:52,463 --> 00:26:56,337
Compact fluorescents. Oh. Bummer.

189
00:27:00,687 --> 00:27:03,142
So I think I'm gonna, go to sleep.

190
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:05,974
You want me to touch your butt first?

191
00:27:07,895 --> 00:27:11,122
No. I only do that when I'm travelling.

192
00:27:12,938 --> 00:27:14,356
Right.

193
00:27:16,794 --> 00:27:19,517
So do you...are you alone here in Maryland 

194
00:27:19,518 --> 00:27:24,546
or do you have relatives around or...? My mom, she's over in Laurel. That...

195
00:27:24,547 --> 00:27:29,166
Her name is Mary. What does she do?

196
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:32,241
She sells insurance to deaf people.

197
00:27:34,025 --> 00:27:36,140
Nice sweatsuit.

198
00:27:40,251 --> 00:27:42,632
I don't want you to take this the wrong way 

199
00:27:42,633 --> 00:27:45,490
but I think we probably shouldn't sleep in the same bed.

200
00:27:47,044 --> 00:27:48,841
It's a good call.

201
00:29:03,513 --> 00:29:05,861
So is your return ticket all set?

202
00:29:08,846 --> 00:29:12,358
I actually don't have one. You don't have a return ticket?

203
00:29:12,853 --> 00:29:15,165
I bought a one way. Why?

204
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,077
That's completely unacceptable, Mike. I know.

205
00:29:19,143 --> 00:29:23,312
You need to buy one. I know, I'm sorry. I didn't have enough money.

206
00:29:24,001 --> 00:29:27,066
What? I only had enough for a one way.

207
00:29:27,164 --> 00:29:32,495
And I thought, I thought, I'm just gonna go for it. With me?

208
00:29:32,496 --> 00:29:38,280
Yes. It was a far flung notion. That was a fucking stupid notion.

209
00:29:38,437 --> 00:29:41,060
I guess. I'll lend you the money.

210
00:29:41,061 --> 00:29:43,333
No, you don't have to do that! Yeah, well I'm going to.

211
00:29:43,334 --> 00:29:48,307
Okay, hey, would you first consider taking a morning off from work?

212
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:51,565
No. We can hang out and then I'll leave.

213
00:29:51,566 --> 00:29:54,142
If I don't you can...mace me.

214
00:29:54,143 --> 00:29:57,866
You're insane. We could go to the zoo, that'd be fun.

215
00:29:57,867 --> 00:30:02,078
Mike, zoos suck. Okay, then we'll do something else.

216
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:05,545
Come on Sue, take a day off from work, you look like you could use it.

217
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:09,355
I do?

218
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,239
Have me buzz those people, come on, let me take it!

219
00:30:26,979 --> 00:30:28,578
Not too hard okay?

220
00:30:36,665 --> 00:30:38,247
You shouldn't smoke.

221
00:30:38,733 --> 00:30:40,845
I'm done. Forever. I'm serious.

222
00:30:40,846 --> 00:30:44,714
No, you don't...hey! You don't need to do that.

223
00:30:44,715 --> 00:30:45,860
Yeah but I am, I'm done.

224
00:30:47,187 --> 00:30:48,383
It's time.

225
00:30:49,941 --> 00:30:54,852
Let's see if I understand something. Do you think that you like me, Mike?

226
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,433
Yes. Why?

227
00:30:58,493 --> 00:31:00,077
Cause you have style.

228
00:31:00,976 --> 00:31:02,145
No I don't. Yeah you do.

229
00:31:02,146 --> 00:31:04,440
No, no. I don't. Yeah.

230
00:31:05,187 --> 00:31:08,267
You give away 30% of your income.

231
00:31:09,685 --> 00:31:13,861
You would to if you'd...make...more. No I wouldn't.

232
00:31:14,908 --> 00:31:17,013
You're also incredibly sweet.

233
00:31:21,411 --> 00:31:27,477
Well beneath... Beneath what?

234
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:30,934
Beneath the part of you that's not.

235
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,631
I'm gonna get you bus.

236
00:31:45,618 --> 00:31:48,226
I'll pay you back for the ticket. Don't worry about it.

237
00:31:51,712 --> 00:31:53,928
So will I ever see you again?

238
00:31:54,565 --> 00:31:57,427
That wouldn't be good for you, Mike. I'm not good with people.

239
00:31:57,428 --> 00:31:59,950
No, that's not true. Yeah, I know it is.

240
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:04,774
No, it's not. What about those homeless guys? They love you.

241
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,803
What about the soccer gals?

242
00:32:12,068 --> 00:32:13,590
What about me?

243
00:32:31,732 --> 00:32:33,951
Okay, buddy, all aboard.

244
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:39,805
Hey, Mike, I think you better go on the bus.

245
00:33:27,227 --> 00:33:31,135
Hey Sue, it's Mike. Calling, again, I'm trying not to call too much but,

246
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:34,802
I just wanted to make sure that you got the poem that I sent last week

247
00:33:34,803 --> 00:33:37,077
you know, the sort of an elongated haiku thing...

248
00:33:39,378 --> 00:33:42,017
Anyway, you know my home number and of course the front desk.

249
00:33:42,018 --> 00:33:45,143
But seriously, you should call cause I'm definitely around.

250
00:33:46,463 --> 00:33:48,876
Anyway, talk to you later, I hope, bye.

251
00:34:37,505 --> 00:34:39,703
I thought you were gonna quit smoking?

252
00:34:45,766 --> 00:34:47,390
I just did.

253
00:34:51,211 --> 00:34:52,769
What are you doing here?

254
00:34:54,221 --> 00:34:55,366
Work.

255
00:34:57,818 --> 00:35:01,928
Hey, did you, did you get my haiku? The elongated one?

256
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:06,100
Yeah. Yeah.

257
00:35:08,149 --> 00:35:09,466
It was nice.

258
00:35:11,894 --> 00:35:14,975
So you're just uh, passing through?

259
00:35:16,287 --> 00:35:18,494
Yeah, fly out from Phoenix tomorrow.

260
00:35:19,134 --> 00:35:21,765
Here, I'll take it. Oh, thank you.

261
00:35:22,058 --> 00:35:27,590
So, this must be a really good region for corporate art sales?

262
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,713
Yes, it is.

263
00:35:34,444 --> 00:35:38,336
Hey, I'm supposed to go to this yoga class later.

264
00:35:39,946 --> 00:35:42,360
Would you like to come with me?

265
00:36:05,011 --> 00:36:07,933
Do you have a boyfriend Sue? No.

266
00:36:08,153 --> 00:36:12,615
Did you, recently? Yes.

267
00:36:13,669 --> 00:36:15,876
What was his name? Jango.

268
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:20,969
He was an ex punk. Ex, like ex punk?

269
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,487
Ex rock punk.

270
00:36:23,577 --> 00:36:26,218
We broke up when he moved away.

271
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:27,431
Why did he leave?

272
00:36:27,432 --> 00:36:33,272
To open the Pacific northwest branch of his organic yoghurt company.

273
00:36:33,273 --> 00:36:35,236
He's the president. Here you go.

274
00:36:35,237 --> 00:36:36,279
Thank you.

275
00:36:39,409 --> 00:36:40,451
Thanks.

276
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:44,100
So how is your job these days? It's okay.

277
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:48,746
But it's not your fantasy job. I don't really do fantasy about it.

278
00:36:48,969 --> 00:36:51,925
If you could close your eyes and pick anything what would it be?

279
00:36:54,282 --> 00:36:56,313
But you gotta close your eyes otherwise it's not gonna work.

280
00:36:57,357 --> 00:36:59,442
Okay.

281
00:37:02,033 --> 00:37:05,666
To run a full service state of the art soup kitchen.

282
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:11,589
Multiple housing units upstairs, recreational facilities in the basement,

283
00:37:11,923 --> 00:37:13,918
job outreach.

284
00:37:13,919 --> 00:37:15,487
Midnight basketball.

285
00:37:15,488 --> 00:37:19,732
Good soup. Excellent soup, first and foremost.

286
00:37:21,023 --> 00:37:23,438
What about kids, you wanna have kids?

287
00:37:25,864 --> 00:37:28,671
You know what was really great about that yoga class?

288
00:37:30,157 --> 00:37:32,762
It was the breathing stuff.

289
00:37:33,276 --> 00:37:36,028
I don't do that. Breathe?

290
00:37:36,029 --> 00:37:43,398
There are days where I have to instruct my heart to request additional air.

291
00:37:45,672 --> 00:37:51,318
And I have to tell myself: 'Breathe, Sue'.

292
00:37:51,528 --> 00:37:53,575
'Just keep breathing'.

293
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:58,157
Yes, I want kids.

294
00:37:58,413 --> 00:38:00,627
Were you not sure when I asked?

295
00:38:03,218 --> 00:38:10,900
I just don't think that I've ever been asked. That way. Before.

296
00:38:12,348 --> 00:38:16,969
Can I ask one more question? Then I'm done, I swear.

297
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:23,185
Will you come visit my mom with me on the way home?

298
00:38:23,642 --> 00:38:27,568
She's sick and I um, I promised I'd stop by.

299
00:38:28,815 --> 00:38:33,234
Here, these are for you. There was a flower show downtown.

300
00:38:33,235 --> 00:38:35,843
That's nice of you.

301
00:38:38,803 --> 00:38:42,603
Hey ma, Sue flew in from Baltimore just this morning.

302
00:38:42,689 --> 00:38:46,412
What do you do, Sue? I sell corporate decorative art.

303
00:38:48,489 --> 00:38:52,414
I've met you before. Yeah, you know, she stayed at the motel, ma.

304
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,620
That's how we met.

305
00:38:53,621 --> 00:38:57,917
And where you're from originally? Uh, I'm from Columbia. Maryland.

306
00:38:58,234 --> 00:39:04,313
Do you come from a good family? Uhm, no not really.

307
00:39:04,335 --> 00:39:08,676
Is there something specifically wrong with your family? 

308
00:39:08,677 --> 00:39:13,328
Uh, well my father lives in ashram, in northern California.

309
00:39:13,543 --> 00:39:17,694
Pretty much sums up everything. About, you know...

310
00:39:18,568 --> 00:39:22,837
He once forgot to pick me up from gymnastics. For an entire night.

311
00:39:22,838 --> 00:39:24,952
That's quite a lot of somersaults.

312
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:34,318
I didn't care. I didn't. It really just explains more about him, um, than it does about me.

313
00:39:37,399 --> 00:39:41,325
Could you hand me those pills, Mike? Which ones?

314
00:39:41,326 --> 00:39:42,859
The ones on the left, Mike.

315
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:57,026
Can I talk to my son in private for a moment? Did I, did I say something wrong?

316
00:39:57,606 --> 00:40:01,280
Not at all. It'll just be a moment.

317
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:05,452
Okay.

318
00:40:11,627 --> 00:40:14,600
I like her. Really?

319
00:40:15,385 --> 00:40:20,935
She's a bit of a long shot. But then she's logical.

320
00:40:20,936 --> 00:40:23,939
In an emotionally annihilated kind of way.

321
00:40:24,301 --> 00:40:29,599
But that's okay, underneath there is a heart of...

322
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,182
Gold? No, I wouldn't say gold.

323
00:40:32,608 --> 00:40:35,941
Maybe made of leather.

324
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:42,770
But if it works out, she'll be good for you when I'm gone.

325
00:40:43,153 --> 00:40:47,164
Needless to say what would make me happy is for you to find 

326
00:40:47,165 --> 00:40:50,251
something for yourself before my check out time.

327
00:40:50,892 --> 00:40:57,079
Just so I know it's not you and your father alone here, walking around like robots.

328
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,190
Ma, dad's not a robot. He is.

329
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,990
But I was mostly talking about you.

330
00:41:05,733 --> 00:41:07,399
Unless you find a way out.

331
00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:12,239
Of what? Of whatever it is you're stuck in.

332
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:20,756
You get it from your father. He came back from the war stuck.

333
00:41:22,141 --> 00:41:25,888
Been talking about joining the gym ever since.

334
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:32,322
Never has. But that doesn't have to be you.

335
00:41:43,614 --> 00:41:47,414
Are you okay? Yeah, are you?

336
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:48,667
Yeah.

337
00:41:50,418 --> 00:41:53,623
She liked you. No she doesn't.

338
00:41:53,624 --> 00:41:56,554
Yeah, she did, she told me.

339
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,912
What took you so long?

340
00:42:17,061 --> 00:42:20,097
Dad, you remember Sue?

341
00:42:23,318 --> 00:42:26,050
There's a toilet overflow in 110.

342
00:42:26,885 --> 00:42:27,928
Okay.

343
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:29,792
Gotta get home to your mom.

344
00:43:07,434 --> 00:43:10,090
Are you really leaving? I have to.

345
00:43:10,091 --> 00:43:15,572
You can't stay one more night? I have meetings this afternoon in Seattle.

346
00:43:15,573 --> 00:43:18,163
Call them off and just stay for a while.

347
00:43:18,163 --> 00:43:20,244
It's my job. I know.

348
00:43:20,245 --> 00:43:24,757
But you know, you could get a job around here. Where, Sechuan house?

349
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,843
No.

350
00:43:26,987 --> 00:43:34,093
I'm just saying that... Mike, don't know how to say this...

351
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:40,438
This isn't gonna work.

352
00:43:40,439 --> 00:43:44,448
I mean I'll stop by when I pass through.

353
00:43:44,448 --> 00:43:45,954
Come on, what do you mean?

354
00:43:47,805 --> 00:43:54,551
I can't move from Baltimore to live in a corner double room of your parents motel.

355
00:43:57,993 --> 00:43:59,766
I mean...

356
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,430
Be serious.

357
00:44:07,201 --> 00:44:12,824
I'm sorry. I'll stay in better touch this time.

358
00:44:12,826 --> 00:44:13,868
Yeah, whatever you say.

359
00:44:51,098 --> 00:44:55,770
So this is where she wanted? This used to be all scrub.

360
00:44:58,102 --> 00:45:00,933
She'd be cringing right now if she knew they'd be building here.

361
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:07,801
But. I promised her I'd do it.

362
00:45:12,189 --> 00:45:14,282
Yeah, it's still nice.

363
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:20,279
I meant to give this to you earlier.

364
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:26,224
It's your mom's favorite piece of jewelry. As you know she was a necklace woman.

365
00:45:27,003 --> 00:45:31,698
She thought you should have it. Dunno why since you won't be wearing it,

366
00:45:32,365 --> 00:45:36,508
maybe you'll find some use for it. Someday.

367
00:45:36,566 --> 00:45:43,377
Thanks, dad. Also I had some guy call me. Wanted to buy the motel.

368
00:45:44,888 --> 00:45:49,484
You're gonna do it? I doubt it, think we'll just keep running it.

369
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:54,986
But you can do what you like Mike. You know, if you wanna leave...

370
00:47:23,138 --> 00:47:26,979
This ain't half bad hunky dory. Yeah, it was my mother's.

371
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:31,079
Oh god, it's not going down the sentimental road. Oh, no I'm just saying...

372
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,069
Yeah, I know what you're saying and I know you're gonna start crying.

373
00:47:34,071 --> 00:47:37,928
What? I'm not. How long you've been in the porn business?

374
00:47:37,929 --> 00:47:38,965
The porn business? 

375
00:47:39,166 --> 00:47:43,136
No, pawn business. How long you've been in the pawn business?

376
00:47:43,231 --> 00:47:47,774
Oh...no, I'm uh...never...I'm... Exactly.

377
00:47:47,775 --> 00:47:50,111
So when someone says he ain't gonna start crying 

378
00:47:50,112 --> 00:47:55,018
that's sure as shit sign that they are just about to start blubbering like a calf.

379
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:06,962
See what I mean? Just, how much, for the necklace?

380
00:48:10,332 --> 00:48:14,741
I'll give you 300. Phh, okay.

381
00:48:22,041 --> 00:48:24,127
Oh... Hi. Hi.

382
00:48:24,503 --> 00:48:28,373
I'm here to see Sue, please. Sue no longer works here.

383
00:48:28,913 --> 00:48:32,554
I'm sorry? She moved to Washington.

384
00:48:32,969 --> 00:48:35,243
D.C.? State.

385
00:48:36,642 --> 00:48:38,759
Her old boyfriend came to convince her to move to Aberdeen.

386
00:48:38,759 --> 00:48:44,282
Showed up with flowers, first class plane tickets, it was very 'officer and gentleman'.

387
00:49:46,429 --> 00:49:47,155
Uh, number eight.

388
00:49:48,615 --> 00:49:50,388
Eight?

389
00:49:54,487 --> 00:49:56,811
Dude, I'm just messing with you.

390
00:49:57,748 --> 00:50:00,810
You're new in town right? Oh. Yeah.

391
00:50:02,797 --> 00:50:06,894
You looking for a job? Yeah.

392
00:50:08,185 --> 00:50:16,845
You wanna work here? Seriously?

393
00:50:16,846 --> 00:50:18,691
Why the fuck wouldn't I be serious?

394
00:50:20,339 --> 00:50:22,571
Al. Mike.

395
00:50:22,572 --> 00:50:24,877
Mike, it is nice to meet you man. Yeah, you too.

396
00:50:24,878 --> 00:50:26,866
Dude, you stink. I do?

397
00:50:26,867 --> 00:50:29,723
Big time. You can't work here if you stink.

398
00:50:29,724 --> 00:50:33,028
It's my parents place, they're old school and they really hate stinky people.

399
00:50:33,223 --> 00:50:33,445
OK

400
00:50:33,675 --> 00:50:39,457
So okay, go home, take a shower, please, come back and I will get you the job.

401
00:50:40,933 --> 00:50:45,068
I don't really have a home. Really?

402
00:50:46,169 --> 00:50:49,665
All right, he also needs a place to live so I was thinking that 

403
00:50:49,818 --> 00:50:54,034
maybe we could you know let him stay in the basement  and deduct some rent from his pay?


404
00:51:01,514 --> 00:51:03,558
Great.

405
00:51:07,003 --> 00:51:10,283
Hey thanks for helping me out, it really means a lot.

406
00:51:10,831 --> 00:51:12,452
Dude, no problem, man.

407
00:51:12,726 --> 00:51:15,516
You know I've been trying to get my folks sign someone American anyway

408
00:51:15,517 --> 00:51:17,857
cause we can't less bigger bullshit that way.

409
00:51:17,858 --> 00:51:20,770
Plus I freaking hate working the mornings. Why?

410
00:51:20,771 --> 00:51:23,618
Because I like smoking pot and sleeping in.

411
00:51:24,229 --> 00:51:27,127
Oh that's cool. So why did you come to Aberdeen, Mike?

412
00:51:27,455 --> 00:51:33,719
Uh, this girl that I'm in love with, she moved here to be with her ex boyfriend.

413
00:51:35,569 --> 00:51:38,171
Oh, that sucks, man. Yeah.

414
00:51:38,172 --> 00:51:41,768
Yeah, especially considering the guy is a punk.

415
00:51:42,509 --> 00:51:46,693
Like a punk punk? Ex punk, think he's older now.

416
00:51:49,225 --> 00:51:51,680
Does he train dogs? I dunno.

417
00:51:51,681 --> 00:51:57,540
Is his name like Jango? Yeah, I think it is!

418
00:51:57,541 --> 00:51:59,476
I have totally heard of this dude, Mike.

419
00:51:59,477 --> 00:52:02,069
Is he a punk? No, he's an ex punk!

420
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:06,738
So the thing with this guy right, he's also a yoghurt magnate. 

421
00:52:06,931 --> 00:52:10,596
Ok, totally huge in a yoghurt business, this guy is like a yoghurt fucking mogul.

422
00:52:11,052 --> 00:52:14,536
You see those kennels over there? That's where he keeps the dogs.

423
00:52:15,873 --> 00:52:17,559
Damn it! What?

424
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:22,379
This guy, this guy is like a total stud. What do you mean?

425
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:27,102
I'm not a sexual superman. This guy...

426
00:52:27,103 --> 00:52:27,833
I mean...

427
00:52:27,851 --> 00:52:30,876
No dude, you're probably fine. You're just saying that.

428
00:52:30,877 --> 00:52:34,246
Yeah, that's true but what do you want me to say, that you're right? No, but...

429
00:52:34,247 --> 00:52:38,143
Ok, look. Now, chicks these days, they don't want sexual supermen,

430
00:52:38,418 --> 00:52:41,584
ok they want hard workers. You know, guys who hustle.

431
00:52:41,584 --> 00:52:43,514
I mean you're a fucking hustler Mike.

432
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:48,684
I mean you came all the way out to Aberdeen dude, that's gotta count for something right? Yeah.

433
00:52:50,414 --> 00:52:53,384
This guy's got shrubbery shaped like pitbulls.

434
00:53:33,462 --> 00:53:36,552
Dude I think I got an idea for how you're gonna get your girl back.

435
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:39,772
Really? See that dude sitting over there?

436
00:53:40,475 --> 00:53:42,718
He runs a flight school over in Olympia.

437
00:53:43,247 --> 00:53:44,929
You should talk to him Mike.

438
00:53:52,227 --> 00:53:55,820
Ok Mike, what I need now is for you to free your mind! 

439
00:53:56,398 --> 00:54:01,138
So let us have a spiritually fulfilling religious fucking moment!

440
00:54:01,347 --> 00:54:03,935
I'm pretty sure I can do it Stan!

441
00:54:03,936 --> 00:54:07,498
That's the Michael I've come to know in the past eight hours!

442
00:54:07,498 --> 00:54:09,391
That's the Mike!

443
00:54:11,427 --> 00:54:12,608
Come on now!

444
00:54:22,653 --> 00:54:26,420
Three, two, one... Wait! Wait, Stan!

445
00:54:38,116 --> 00:54:42,190
Okay now Mike, you're on your ooooooown!

446
00:55:12,565 --> 00:55:16,217
Jesus! God! Jangoooo!

447
00:55:19,429 --> 00:55:22,176
Oh my god! Who is, who is that?

448
00:55:22,177 --> 00:55:24,159
It's me, Mike.

449
00:55:24,306 --> 00:55:25,779
Mike?

450
00:55:27,014 --> 00:55:29,589
What are you doing? Mike, come here.

451
00:55:30,788 --> 00:55:33,061
Jango, cut up with shooting!

452
00:55:33,735 --> 00:55:35,840
What the fuck is going on!

453
00:55:36,768 --> 00:55:39,724
Jango, stop shooting people! Stop it!

454
00:55:40,674 --> 00:55:42,657
Come here, follow my hand.

455
00:55:43,742 --> 00:55:44,660
Stop it!

456
00:55:45,523 --> 00:55:48,655
Here, I got you.

457
00:55:50,605 --> 00:55:51,963
Oh god, are you okay?

458
00:55:52,137 --> 00:55:53,711
Stay away. Sue.

459
00:55:55,026 --> 00:55:57,792
Jango, give me the gun, give me the damn gun. I'm gonna die.

460
00:55:57,792 --> 00:56:00,527
It's just a bb gun. No, I really think I'm dying.

461
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:02,554
Oh my god! Get back, Sue. Come here.

462
00:56:04,042 --> 00:56:07,213
Jango, what are you doing? CPR!

463
00:56:07,214 --> 00:56:08,257
Oh my god I'm calling an ambulance.

464
00:56:10,709 --> 00:56:13,370
Well that just looks like you're kissing him, Jango.

465
00:56:34,409 --> 00:56:38,342
Where am I? The Aberdeen medical center.

466
00:56:41,792 --> 00:56:46,234
Did uh, did... Yeah, Jango shot you.

467
00:56:46,235 --> 00:56:48,413
Which caused you to go into shock.

468
00:56:50,516 --> 00:56:56,475
Mike, why? Why did you come out here?

469
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:59,959
Because I love you.

470
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:08,681
That...Do I have bb hose in my neck? Yeah.

471
00:57:08,681 --> 00:57:10,580
That hurt. Well I can imagine.

472
00:57:12,849 --> 00:57:15,661
I thought it was over with that guy?

473
00:57:16,746 --> 00:57:18,422
It's good for me, Mike.

474
00:57:18,423 --> 00:57:21,504
He put me in charge of his company's non profit yoghurt fund 

475
00:57:21,505 --> 00:57:24,687
which allows me to do a lot of good things for a lot of people.

476
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:30,829
He also feels horrible for shooting you and he would like to have you over for dinner.

477
00:57:31,338 --> 00:57:33,097
Oooh, that's nice.

478
00:57:36,484 --> 00:57:38,338
Hey, so who's this guy?

479
00:57:40,455 --> 00:57:47,950
That is me and Joe Strummer in the summer of '79 at the 100 Club in London.

480
00:57:47,951 --> 00:57:49,342
Who is Joe Strummer?

481
00:57:49,343 --> 00:57:54,921
Joe Strummer most likely made love to your mother Al and wrote a song about it.

482
00:57:54,922 --> 00:57:57,930
Here's the two of us throwing over at the CBGB's.

483
00:57:57,931 --> 00:58:00,603
Hey, who is that?

484
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:06,390
Ah, that's me and Ed McMahon. Ed Mc Wild Mahon.

485
00:58:07,355 --> 00:58:09,231
Now he's a true punker.

486
00:58:09,887 --> 00:58:12,894
Basically for me, dog work is a thrill, adrenaline rush if you will,

487
00:58:12,895 --> 00:58:19,859
that's otherwise hard for me to replicate in the world of yoghurt.

488
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:21,861
Especially now that you're not a punk.

489
00:58:21,862 --> 00:58:26,059
Well I'll always be a punker in here, Al. Make no mistake.

490
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:29,049
But there's less need for me to call myself a punker 

491
00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:37,284
in a world where very notion of punk then means commodified for the mass market. OK.

492
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:40,962
How do you like your masala? It's really good.

493
00:58:41,754 --> 00:58:46,256
Oh, you're not gonna eat any? Oh, I liquified it.

494
00:58:46,257 --> 00:58:52,497
Listen, I would just like to formally and quite sincerely apologize to you for the BB gun incident. 

495
00:58:52,722 --> 00:58:55,208
I lost my cool.

496
00:58:55,209 --> 00:59:01,753
I was scared, for Sue. Scared for the dogs. Scared for the general well being of the pool.

497
00:59:01,754 --> 00:59:10,640
So I just wanna say that I'm sorry, m m... Mike... my friend.

498
00:59:10,745 --> 00:59:12,491
I blundered. Yeah, it's alright.

499
00:59:12,492 --> 00:59:15,577
Yeah so that's, behind us!

500
00:59:15,578 --> 00:59:18,742
And Sue tells me that you're a painter?

501
00:59:20,103 --> 00:59:22,978
Yeah, very, very talented painter.

502
00:59:24,212 --> 00:59:28,241
When did you have the opportunity to become acquainted with the quality of his work, Sue?

503
00:59:28,242 --> 00:59:34,259
That was my last business trip for uh, Corporate Bliss.

504
00:59:34,261 --> 00:59:45,580
And you thought, uh "a great opportunity to promote my art" or you thought "beautiful woman"?

505
00:59:47,203 --> 00:59:50,814
First part. The um art one.

506
00:59:51,249 --> 00:59:56,564
Now so you're the guy who paints foxes and and hounds for corporate art?

507
00:59:57,090 --> 00:59:59,191
Okay, cause I got something to say about that.

508
00:59:59,192 --> 01:00:04,523
You take a, a Rottweiler, no, let's say a Malinois...

509
01:00:04,524 --> 01:00:09,041
chasing a fox, see you've got a seriously new dynamic on your hands

510
01:00:09,042 --> 01:00:14,359
because a Malinois on a fox's ass, that would be a trip.

511
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:20,764
because a Malinois is gonna turn that little fox into a fox meat inside a twenty three seconds,

512
01:00:20,765 --> 01:00:22,432
you know what I'm saying.

513
01:00:22,433 --> 01:00:26,132
So I've decided a lobby for that little bit. Okay.

514
01:00:26,133 --> 01:00:30,042
That was really great chicken, Jango. I loved that fucking chicken Jango.

515
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:34,047
You'd have a better chicken in there, you'd have to be a rooster.

516
01:00:39,791 --> 01:00:41,679
Speaking up, who's up for some dessert?

517
01:00:42,123 --> 01:00:47,765
I got a new flavour I wanna try on you guys: Henry Rollins' chicken wing crunch.

518
01:00:51,949 --> 01:00:56,531
Hey Sue, Mike and I are gonna go to the Cowboy Club after this and if you want to join us? 

519
01:00:56,745 --> 01:00:58,825
You know they've got really great dancing.

520
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:00,728
I'll think about it.

521
01:01:08,692 --> 01:01:13,250
What I'm trying to say is that China is not only gonna kick America's economic butt

522
01:01:13,251 --> 01:01:15,115
but it's gonna invade the whole country. 

523
01:01:15,116 --> 01:01:19,191
I'm talking about you guys getting like a whole new flag and whatnot.

524
01:01:19,393 --> 01:01:22,009
You need to reorient your way you think about Asians,

525
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:26,044
because we will blow your mind with our uniqueness and inner beauty.

526
01:01:26,045 --> 01:01:27,631
You think she's hot?

527
01:01:28,033 --> 01:01:29,351
Yeah, sort of.

528
01:01:29,969 --> 01:01:34,286
Hi, guys. Sue. Hi.

529
01:01:35,538 --> 01:01:36,789
Hi, Mike.

530
01:01:38,374 --> 01:01:40,706
You didn't bring Jango, did you?

531
01:01:40,707 --> 01:01:46,691
No, no he's got kinda drunk so, I've just told him that I had an errand.

532
01:01:49,328 --> 01:01:52,068
Hey, you wanna dance with us, Sue? No.

533
01:01:52,069 --> 01:01:54,767
Come on, I know you got a move. I don't have a move.

534
01:01:54,767 --> 01:01:56,512
Everybody's got a move, Sue. Mike, show her your move.

535
01:01:56,513 --> 01:01:59,620
I don't have a move. Sue, don't you think Mike's got moves?

536
01:02:00,004 --> 01:02:01,977
I bet you have, a move.

537
01:02:01,978 --> 01:02:03,872
Come on, let's pass some moves.

538
01:02:55,934 --> 01:03:02,251
Hey, did you hear? Aberdeen is building the biggest bio diesel field plant in the country.

539
01:03:02,729 --> 01:03:04,196
Whatever you say man.

540
01:03:04,198 --> 01:03:06,238
No, we should find a way to get in on that.

541
01:03:13,258 --> 01:03:14,783
Hey, Jango.

542
01:03:15,379 --> 01:03:18,586
You know why I'll always be a punker man?

543
01:03:20,739 --> 01:03:24,456
Cause I take very little shit.

544
01:03:29,384 --> 01:03:34,164
I'm watching you man. You stay away from her.

545
01:03:38,933 --> 01:03:40,930
Mike, Mike, you all right?

546
01:03:40,931 --> 01:03:46,640
I'll get him back. Yeah man, that is a piece of scum, man.

547
01:03:46,641 --> 01:03:48,501
I think he'll regret that.

548
01:03:56,118 --> 01:03:59,092
So you're sure you wanna do this? Look, don't come if you don't want.

549
01:03:59,093 --> 01:03:59,927
Dude.

550
01:03:59,956 --> 01:04:01,471
I'm with you.

551
01:04:01,824 --> 01:04:03,940
Okay, let's do it.

552
01:05:47,169 --> 01:05:48,420
Dude, that was awesome!

553
01:05:49,464 --> 01:05:50,507
Just...

554
01:05:55,511 --> 01:05:58,639
Wait, wait. Drop. Go go go go!

555
01:05:58,640 --> 01:05:59,578
Hold on. Shit!

556
01:05:59,647 --> 01:06:01,497
I love you, Sue!

557
01:06:02,568 --> 01:06:05,858
Hear that old man! You suck.

558
01:06:20,134 --> 01:06:24,521
Mike, you have visitor. Okay.

559
01:06:44,972 --> 01:06:48,057
We need to talk, Mike. I know.

560
01:06:48,058 --> 01:06:50,490
I've been leaving you messages.

561
01:06:52,331 --> 01:06:58,723
Did you tell him about us? Yes.

562
01:07:00,205 --> 01:07:01,755
Why?

563
01:07:03,543 --> 01:07:05,557
Because I'm marrying him.

564
01:07:06,896 --> 01:07:07,894
What?

565
01:07:08,217 --> 01:07:10,336
Which I need you to accept.

566
01:07:10,469 --> 01:07:11,962
Why?

567
01:07:11,963 --> 01:07:17,052
Because I'm at a point in my life where there are certain things that I need.

568
01:07:17,054 --> 01:07:17,983
Like what?

569
01:07:17,984 --> 01:07:19,994
Like a certain kind of love.

570
01:07:19,995 --> 01:07:21,596
What kind?

571
01:07:21,597 --> 01:07:26,124
The kind that is not like an unguided missile.

572
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:30,167
You can't just stalk people around the country.

573
01:07:30,168 --> 01:07:33,465
You can't parachute into people's pools.

574
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:38,767
Knock on people's motel rooms just because you're feeling lonely.

575
01:07:39,888 --> 01:07:41,793
Life isn't like that.

576
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:48,796
Freedom to be with someone. It's not all about what you need.

577
01:07:49,126 --> 01:07:53,795
It's got to be more selfless than that. Mike, it's got to be more selfless than that.

578
01:07:53,797 --> 01:07:59,161
Oh, like, like save everyone else in the world except yourself?

579
01:07:59,162 --> 01:08:01,915
I don't, that's not what I do. Yes you do.

580
01:08:01,916 --> 01:08:03,739
No. It's not. Yes it is!

581
01:08:04,545 --> 01:08:09,685
You're so busy being selfless that you end up treating yourself like shit.

582
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,331
That really what you think of me?

583
01:08:12,332 --> 01:08:17,203
I'm just, I'm just saying...I know what you need.

584
01:08:17,204 --> 01:08:21,309
Which is what? To take care of yourself a little.

585
01:08:22,026 --> 01:08:26,813
So that the people who love you don't feel like they're annoying you.

586
01:08:28,713 --> 01:08:33,608
Sue, Sue, just, marry me.

587
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:38,197
Hey, let's just let the world go screw itself for a half second.

588
01:08:38,198 --> 01:08:41,518
And just see what happens and maybe it'll be okay.

589
01:08:45,899 --> 01:08:49,632
I'm getting married on Saturday. Why?

590
01:08:52,212 --> 01:08:53,976
Cause I'm pregnant.

591
01:08:58,543 --> 01:09:04,667
And I'm gonna have it. It's what I want.

592
01:09:08,849 --> 01:09:10,839
You're having a child?

593
01:09:15,938 --> 01:09:18,706
Could it be mine?

594
01:09:18,875 --> 01:09:20,069
No.

595
01:09:27,661 --> 01:09:29,394
Which is why I'm getting married.

596
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:36,655
Mike I can't afford to be selfish on this one.

597
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:43,044
I just have to be with somebody who knows what they're doing with their life.

598
01:09:46,598 --> 01:09:48,216
I'm sorry.

599
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:52,322
Sweet just doesn't cut it.

600
01:10:03,643 --> 01:10:06,454
Can you leave now, please?

601
01:10:09,057 --> 01:10:11,205
Just leave, okay.

602
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:16,615
Get out of my basement, Sue.

603
01:10:17,524 --> 01:10:23,343
Susan, I'm serious. Get the fuck out of my basement right now!

604
01:11:25,976 --> 01:11:29,048
I wish I had that dick's bb gun right now.

605
01:11:30,268 --> 01:11:32,832
They're going on a honeymoon? I don't know.

606
01:11:35,133 --> 01:11:37,815
Yeah, they'll probably wait till the yoghurt season's over.

607
01:11:48,444 --> 01:11:51,525
You're gonna be all right. Yeah.

608
01:11:54,428 --> 01:12:02,915
I just wanna say Al, you're the best friend I ever had.

609
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:06,015
Ditto.

610
01:12:14,649 --> 01:12:16,672
What a douchebag huh?

611
01:12:21,349 --> 01:12:24,169
You know that's enough to make you want to be a buddhist monk.

612
01:12:24,825 --> 01:12:27,419
My people are really good at that stuff.

613
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:28,463
Yeah?

614
01:12:35,958 --> 01:12:39,602
Oh dude, don't get carried away.

615
01:13:51,289 --> 01:13:57,131
Michael, the progress you've made in your 4 months here has been remarkable.

616
01:13:57,132 --> 01:13:58,174
Thank you, father.

617
01:13:58,175 --> 01:14:03,194
Needless to say your immersion in the duty of carriage shopper 

618
01:14:03,389 --> 01:14:06,114
and boon chief has been full and complete. Thank you.

619
01:14:07,106 --> 01:14:10,547
But some worries have arisen. Such as what, father?

620
01:14:10,548 --> 01:14:13,322
First of all you're not supposed to call me father.

621
01:14:15,879 --> 01:14:19,094
But I must say, I must admit I grow fond of it.

622
01:14:19,408 --> 01:14:21,181
Michael...

623
01:14:22,409 --> 01:14:30,715
An aspiring buddhist monk such as yourself should seek to produce a heart that does not dwell.

624
01:14:30,715 --> 01:14:32,460
Of course, father.

625
01:14:32,758 --> 01:14:37,512
And your heart Michael, may I say, does dwell.

626
01:14:37,513 --> 01:14:39,518
No it doesn't. It does, Michael.

627
01:14:39,947 --> 01:14:43,597
You have not transcended your earthly passions.

628
01:14:44,609 --> 01:14:48,649
To put it bluntly: you are stuck!

629
01:14:49,158 --> 01:14:52,256
You also spend too much time playing volleybal.

630
01:14:52,257 --> 01:14:54,691
Yeah but I thought that was permitted father.

631
01:14:54,692 --> 01:15:00,335
Yes but not for seven hours a day. Also you encouraged it for stress release.

632
01:15:00,336 --> 01:15:03,406
Yes, I, I did. Yes. But uh, Michael, 

633
01:15:03,407 --> 01:15:09,547
buddhists monks aren't supposed to have seven hours a day worth of stress.

634
01:15:09,548 --> 01:15:13,634
We are buddhist monks. Buddhist monks.

635
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,347
So what should I do?

636
01:15:22,282 --> 01:15:24,386
My parents died when I was ten.

637
01:15:24,387 --> 01:15:28,188
Two months later my uncle and I moved to America.

638
01:15:28,189 --> 01:15:32,458
I was forced to let go of everything I knew. In order to move on.

639
01:15:34,179 --> 01:15:37,610
Sometimes in life, you must do that.

640
01:15:39,504 --> 01:15:41,676
Where are you from, father?

641
01:15:42,637 --> 01:15:46,805
Vietnam. Hau Liang province?

642
01:15:48,305 --> 01:15:50,939
My parents were killed in a war.

643
01:15:52,345 --> 01:15:54,644
By the Americans? Yes.

644
01:15:55,655 --> 01:15:57,803
And yet I moved here.

645
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:00,439
I like this park.

646
01:16:05,624 --> 01:16:08,913
I'm sorry. No no no.

647
01:16:08,915 --> 01:16:11,081
It is not your fault.

648
01:16:13,116 --> 01:16:17,644
Let go, Michael. Let go and move on.

649
01:17:35,307 --> 01:17:39,483
I reckon I knew you. Yeah, I'm the guy who sold you my mom's necklace.

650
01:17:39,484 --> 01:17:40,527
Oh yes, right.

651
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:44,643
What can I do you for? I want it back.

652
01:18:01,322 --> 01:18:06,392
Dad, do you want me to make you some dinner? No, I'm all right.

653
01:18:18,984 --> 01:18:27,919
Dad, when you were over in Vietnam, did you ever do any fighting in the Hau Liang province?

654
01:18:33,553 --> 01:18:37,186
Yeah. Why?

655
01:18:41,574 --> 01:18:45,198
I just met this guy at the monastery who was from the area.

656
01:18:47,558 --> 01:18:50,056
Seemed to really have his shit together.

657
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:54,316
Good to hear.

658
01:19:09,614 --> 01:19:12,686
Dad, I been thinking, maybe you should sell this place.

659
01:19:14,022 --> 01:19:16,003
You don't even like it here.

660
01:19:16,004 --> 01:19:17,877
This was mom's thing.

661
01:19:18,612 --> 01:19:20,427
Why do you say that?

662
01:19:20,428 --> 01:19:21,919
Cause it's true.

663
01:19:23,964 --> 01:19:28,007
My mom loved people, loved running things, it's not like you.

664
01:19:28,008 --> 01:19:31,449
You're not like a people's person, dad.

665
01:19:32,446 --> 01:19:34,145
You should let it go.

666
01:19:34,967 --> 01:19:36,517
Move on.

667
01:19:37,334 --> 01:19:39,164
Otherwise you're just gonna rot.

668
01:19:39,165 --> 01:19:41,946
Sell it and do what? Anything.

669
01:19:41,947 --> 01:19:44,027
You've still got time. You've got money.

670
01:19:45,616 --> 01:19:48,572
What do you need Mike? A loan.

671
01:19:48,573 --> 01:19:56,628
No. I just wanted to say, that this doesn't have to be it.

672
01:20:00,004 --> 01:20:01,993
And that I love you.

673
01:20:25,083 --> 01:20:30,014
Dear Mike, I know you probably don't want to hear from me and I can't say I blame you.

674
01:20:30,015 --> 01:20:33,762
But I wanted to write anyway to let you know what I think.

675
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:37,445
Which is that I think you had a point that day.

676
01:20:37,911 --> 01:20:40,608
About people who hide behind their causes.

677
01:20:40,609 --> 01:20:43,232
in order to avoid their lives

678
01:20:46,515 --> 01:20:51,646
You had a point down there in that basement. With the soy sauce and the mice.

679
01:20:53,913 --> 01:20:56,819
And so I wanted to say thanks.

680
01:20:58,765 --> 01:21:02,329
Because of you Mike, I'm not the same person I was.

681
01:21:04,092 --> 01:21:07,565
Goodbye, Mike. Love, Sue.

682
01:21:14,010 --> 01:21:17,168
Just thought about what you said the other day.

683
01:21:17,169 --> 01:21:17,960
I think you had a point.

684
01:21:23,689 --> 01:21:27,387
That being said, this is yours.

685
01:21:28,749 --> 01:21:32,783
What is it? Deed to the motel. Signed over to you.

686
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:39,447
Dad. Dad, that's not why.... It's fine.

687
01:21:39,448 --> 01:21:42,206
I don't need it.

688
01:21:43,478 --> 01:21:49,036
Your mom was good about that. You can't just give me the motel.

689
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:50,353
It's your birth right.

690
01:21:52,942 --> 01:21:54,377
What would you do?

691
01:21:54,378 --> 01:21:55,733
I want to get in shape.

692
01:21:56,937 --> 01:22:00,979
Maybe join one of those basketball leagues.

693
01:22:02,139 --> 01:22:06,633
How about you? I don't know. I'll think of something.

694
01:22:08,793 --> 01:22:14,183
You done with the monk stuff? Yeah, I still ocassionally do it.

695
01:22:15,591 --> 01:22:18,288
I mean not professionally but...

696
01:22:21,351 --> 01:22:23,094
What about that girl?

697
01:22:25,554 --> 01:22:27,784
Oh, that didn't work out.

698
01:22:28,785 --> 01:22:34,122
We weren't, you know, like, meant for each other.

699
01:22:35,663 --> 01:22:40,420
I dunno Mike, things change. In life.

700
01:22:42,033 --> 01:22:44,321
What do you mean?

701
01:22:44,322 --> 01:22:46,289
You're not the same guy you were.

702
01:22:54,714 --> 01:22:56,570
Good soup.

703
01:23:00,463 --> 01:23:02,018
Good soup.

704
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:17,752
You can do this, Mike.

705
01:23:25,151 --> 01:23:27,567
I'm gonna hit the gym.

706
01:23:28,027 --> 01:23:31,341
Yeah, they have a senior citizens hoop run from 3 to 5.

707
01:23:33,216 --> 01:23:34,685
I got a new ball.

708
01:23:34,686 --> 01:23:36,212
Yeah, I see it.

709
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:40,858
All right, Mike. See ya.

710
01:23:53,263 --> 01:23:56,386
Hallo? Hi Jango, it's Mike, Sue's friend.

711
01:23:56,636 --> 01:23:57,696
Hi Mike.

712
01:23:57,697 --> 01:24:01,053
Hi. Look I know that I'm probably not the guy you want to hear from right now 

713
01:24:01,242 --> 01:24:04,181
but I need to tell Sue about what I'm doing down here.

714
01:24:04,183 --> 01:24:06,376
And I think that when she hears what I'm up to... Hey Mike?

715
01:24:06,685 --> 01:24:09,505
...she will at least understand that if nothing else...

716
01:24:09,506 --> 01:24:10,444
Mike? Yeah?

717
01:24:10,485 --> 01:24:16,937
We split up, Sue and I. Split up. She left me.

718
01:24:17,037 --> 01:24:20,036
Went back to Maryland to be with her mom.

719
01:24:57,574 --> 01:24:58,617
Hi Hi.

720
01:24:59,068 --> 01:25:02,424
Are you Mary Claussen? Yes?

721
01:25:03,468 --> 01:25:04,511
Hi Hi.

722
01:25:05,156 --> 01:25:07,329
I'm a friend of Sue's. Is she home?

723
01:25:07,691 --> 01:25:12,421
Who are you? Mike? From management.

724
01:25:16,121 --> 01:25:19,161
Sue, Mike is here.

725
01:25:44,187 --> 01:25:47,315
Hi. Hi.

726
01:25:52,054 --> 01:25:53,976
How's the baby?

727
01:25:56,127 --> 01:25:58,075
So far so good.

728
01:25:59,739 --> 01:26:01,273
Are you okay?

729
01:26:14,268 --> 01:26:16,444
I'm really sorry, Mike.

730
01:26:16,523 --> 01:26:17,927
For what?

731
01:26:17,928 --> 01:26:22,206
Cause I really messed up. With you.

732
01:26:22,371 --> 01:26:26,263
But you were right. I was like a kid.

733
01:26:32,276 --> 01:26:35,363
This is the deed to the motel.

734
01:26:37,174 --> 01:26:43,848
I want to turn it into a homeless shelter with midnight basketball.

735
01:26:46,384 --> 01:26:47,971
I already bought the soup noodles.

736
01:26:53,572 --> 01:26:58,069
I was actually hoping that you might want to help.

737
01:27:03,807 --> 01:27:11,464
I really love you Sue and I want to take care of you and whoever it is that's inside of you.

738
01:27:16,412 --> 01:27:20,749
All I want is to be with you. That's it.

739
01:27:32,022 --> 01:27:34,458
Breathe, Sue.

740
01:27:35,993 --> 01:27:38,046
Just keep breathing.

741
01:27:51,346 --> 01:27:55,672
I wrote you a haiku, you wanna hear it?

742
01:27:56,728 --> 01:27:57,921
Sure.

743
01:28:01,635 --> 01:28:09,178
Mike, oh Mike, my man. Keeps showing up like UPS.

744
01:28:10,114 --> 01:28:13,004
Sue, you're such a bitch.

745
01:28:16,085 --> 01:28:17,802
I like it.

746
01:28:17,851 --> 01:28:19,784
You do? Yeah.
