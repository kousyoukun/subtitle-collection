1
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,809
<i>Twelve seconds on the clock.</i>

2
00:00:41,843 --> 00:00:44,846
<i>Third down with 52 yards
to the end zone.</i>

3
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,848
<i>Yeah, Chuck,
they're about five yards shy</i>

4
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:48,850
<i>from being
within field goal range.</i>

5
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:51,385
<i>I really think they're gonna need
a Hail Mary to make this play.</i>

6
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:53,120
<i>And here's the hike.</i>

7
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:55,723
<i>Boy wonder quarterback
Casey Rhodes got the ball.</i>

8
00:00:55,757 --> 00:00:58,325
<i>Landon Morris
has shut down Ben Roy.</i>

9
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,460
<i>Rhodes is running it!
He's running it!</i>

10
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:02,229
<i>And the crowd is loving it!</i>

11
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:04,799
<i>And Rhodes is making a mockery
of Atlanta's defense!</i>

12
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:06,834
<i>Jo won Briggs
is gaining on Rhodes.</i>

13
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:09,236
<i>Rhodes is gonna get up. He's going!</i>

14
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,739
<i>- Oh! Whoa, whoa!
- Yeah.</i>

15
00:01:11,773 --> 00:01:15,442
<i>Oh, Jo won Briggs
sacked Rhodes on the two-yard line.</i>

16
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,513
<i>We are not made
to bend that way.</i>

17
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:21,248
<i>Oh, that's
devastating, Dave, for Rhodes.</i>

18
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:24,384
<i>All play-off hopes are gone
in one savage tackle.</i>

19
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:28,221
<i>- Well, you know, Chuck, that's football.
- That's football.</i>

20
00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:43,270
Hey, you guys gotta move.

21
00:01:43,905 --> 00:01:45,840
You're blocking us in.

22
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:46,908
What the hell?

23
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:48,676
Nathanial Wilson!

24
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:52,312
You live at 1403 Angel Avenue
with your wife and daughter.

25
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:54,849
Open the truck and forget
that I know where you live.

26
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:58,452
Don't think about your job.
Think about your fucking family!

27
00:01:58,485 --> 00:01:59,787
Nathanial!

28
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:01,221
Don't do it, don't do it.

29
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:08,930
Move. Give me the keys!

30
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:10,330
Go!

31
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,467
Get on your knees.
Hands behind your head.

32
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:14,535
Do it!

33
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:18,706
Thirty seconds to go.

34
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:22,376
Twenty-nine, 28...

35
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,214
Fifteen, 14...

36
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:31,653
Twelve, 11, ten,

37
00:02:31,686 --> 00:02:35,890
nine, eight, seven...

38
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,257
He's running!
You mother...

39
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,728
...two, one.

40
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,363
Time's up. Let's move!

41
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:50,404
Come on, come on, come on.

42
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:56,209
Check the alley.

43
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:57,845
Knight, get your ass
downtown now!

44
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:05,586
Let's go.

45
00:03:12,727 --> 00:03:14,896
Drop your keys!
Whoa! You can have the car.

46
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:17,965
Get the fuck outta here!

47
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:22,436
Let's go!
Come on. Come on. Come on.

48
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,005
Are you fucking kidding me?

49
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:26,808
I got it. I got it.
I got it. I got it.

50
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:28,676
Are you fucking kidding me?

51
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,377
- You're up, Mike.
- I'm on it.

52
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:36,584
Let's go!
Mike, let's go!

53
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:44,291
Don't leave anyone behind.

54
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,560
Let's go!

55
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:55,235
Oh, for fuck's sake!

56
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,574
Where are you going?

57
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,274
Fuck!

58
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,344
I'm going.

59
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:21,028
Let's go!

60
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,635
Come here, piggies!

61
00:04:36,978 --> 00:04:40,313
Yo, where are you going?
The car's this way.

62
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:41,816
Police! Freeze!

63
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:42,984
Drop your weap...

64
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:44,986
Get down! Shit!

65
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:46,453
Hey, man.

66
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,457
What's all that cowboy
shit, man? Stick to the plan!

67
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,826
I'm playing to win.

68
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:53,027
Ah, fuck.

69
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:58,431
You should've said "Please."

70
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,934
Fuck you, buddy.

71
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:02,402
No, thanks.

72
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:09,076
I'll get 'em this time.

73
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,846
On three, you ready?
On three, you move. One...

74
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,346
- Two.
- Three. Go!

75
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:20,988
- I got one.
- Let's get outta here.

76
00:05:21,022 --> 00:05:23,090
Hey... Get the fucking car.
Let's go. What the fuck?

77
00:05:23,124 --> 00:05:24,357
After you.

78
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,032
Knight.

79
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:35,903
Come on. Let's go!

80
00:05:45,046 --> 00:05:46,047
On your mark!

81
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,888
All right, get in the car.
Let's go!

82
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:55,355
Let's go! Come on!

83
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:03,798
Help me, James.

84
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,702
Watch out, watch out!

85
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:19,412
Knight, help me.

86
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,041
Casey, can we talk about
what happened?

87
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:23,210
I didn't sign up
to shoot cops, man.

88
00:07:24,045 --> 00:07:26,147
The whole FBI
is probably chasing us by now.

89
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:30,785
It was us or them.

90
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:33,654
That cop did his job,
we did ours.

91
00:07:33,688 --> 00:07:36,991
We did it better on the day.
For what? A couple grand?

92
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:43,097
Uh, six, seven, eight, minus
Winna's cut. So, that's, uh, 134K.

93
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:45,465
134?

94
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:47,802
That make it okay
to shoot cops then?

95
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:51,772
No, but I mean, it's 134.

96
00:07:51,806 --> 00:07:54,008
Should we just head to Vegas?

97
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:56,110
Have a cocktail.

98
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,681
I'm down.

99
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:04,585
Yo.

100
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:12,727
So, what in the actual fuck
was that about?

101
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,663
You told me to take care of it,
so I took care of it.

102
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:18,165
Besides, you're the one
who shot the fucking cop.

103
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:20,101
Because I was cleaning up
your fucking mess.

104
00:08:20,134 --> 00:08:21,769
You keep telling yourself that.

105
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:24,705
You told me to do something,
and I fucking did it.

106
00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:29,076
I mean, that was better than a fucking
Pick 6 on a Sunday fucking afternoon.

107
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,311
That's not the point of it.

108
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,279
Whoa, whoa. What's your point?

109
00:08:32,313 --> 00:08:33,981
You not only
put my life in danger,

110
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:36,650
you tried to screw over
our fucking teammates.

111
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:38,886
Do you think I don't have
your fucking back?

112
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,088
Huh?
Is that what you're saying?

113
00:08:41,122 --> 00:08:43,758
You're the one coming to me,
"Oh, my knee is busted.

114
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,760
Oh, shit.
Give me some fucking pills.

115
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:48,329
Oh, come practice with me so I
can make a fucking comeback.

116
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,165
Oh, my life is over." Huh?
Who had your fucking back then?

117
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,801
You asked me to go,
and I fucking go.

118
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,236
Fuck you, Casey.

119
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:58,606
You know I'm not in this
for the money.

120
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,325
- Move, move.
- Coming through.

121
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:20,227
Everybody,
please get out of the way.

122
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:01,869
Hey. Yeah, we made it.

123
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:03,370
Your fuckin' plane was late.

124
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:11,212
Well, Mercer went off.

125
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:16,350
Yeah, we'll be at LaGuardia
in four hours.

126
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:18,986
No, fuck LA.
Oh, fuck Mercer.

127
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:20,821
I'm never working
with him again.

128
00:10:22,423 --> 00:10:23,791
Bye.

129
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:11,172
Whoo!

130
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:17,311
Yeah. All right, I'll get
Mercer's cut to him.

131
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:18,345
Thank you.

132
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:21,315
138K. This is Winna's cut.

133
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,449
Hey, Case.

134
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:25,419
I know the last time,
it went to shit.

135
00:11:26,287 --> 00:11:28,289
But I've been working
on something.

136
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:30,724
I watch this guy on
YouTube, super legit.

137
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:33,160
And guess what?
I copied him.

138
00:11:34,228 --> 00:11:36,297
And I was thinking,
for next time...

139
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,832
The fuck are you
talking about, man?

140
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:40,000
Hold that thought.

141
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:50,344
Easy. Easy, easy, easy.

142
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,079
Easy.

143
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:53,147
What the...

144
00:11:56,518 --> 00:11:57,751
A fucking pipe bomb?

145
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:04,526
Get that out of here right now.

146
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:06,927
If we need a distraction,
we could use it.

147
00:12:06,961 --> 00:12:09,964
Then we'll have Homeland Security
on your asses for, like, the end of time.

148
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:11,165
You built this?

149
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:12,499
From scratch, bro.

150
00:12:12,534 --> 00:12:14,168
That guy from YouTube,

151
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:16,103
he could teach a toddler
to make one of these things.

152
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:17,171
That's terrifying.

153
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:18,806
Yeah.

154
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,841
Yeah, it kind of is terrifying.

155
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:23,244
Whoa. You want me
to get rid of it?

156
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:26,413
Yes! Obviously. I can't even
believe this is a real conversation.

157
00:12:26,447 --> 00:12:31,051
Let's stash it, you know,
for an emergency.

158
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:33,254
You're both insane.
I'm just thinking ahead.

159
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:35,889
Like Cap taught me, right, Case?

160
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,894
Okay, goodbye.

161
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:43,197
Come on. You're a little bit
impressed. Where are you going?

162
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,567
Out.
Sykes.

163
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,569
Wait, wait, wait, Sykes.

164
00:12:47,602 --> 00:12:49,504
I'm having a little
get-together tomorrow night.

165
00:12:49,537 --> 00:12:52,373
Couple of people. If you
wanna come by, just come by.

166
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:54,375
Maybe.

167
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:56,210
Bye.

168
00:12:57,845 --> 00:12:59,079
What's her deal?

169
00:13:00,615 --> 00:13:01,915
Bye, Sykes.

170
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:02,950
Bye!

171
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:05,185
She's right, you know?

172
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,821
You are insane.

173
00:13:09,056 --> 00:13:10,357
No, but I love it.

174
00:13:12,226 --> 00:13:13,327
My man.

175
00:13:15,563 --> 00:13:17,364
Now...

176
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:21,302
How'd you do this?

177
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:23,070
I'm actually glad you asked.

178
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,481
How do you do that?

179
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,118
Lots of practice.

180
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:40,854
How can you be
at the wrong place

181
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:43,324
at the right time all the time?

182
00:13:44,058 --> 00:13:46,561
These guys were spraying
and praying.

183
00:13:46,594 --> 00:13:49,229
<i>It was 50/50 that they would
have hit you or Fitz.</i>

184
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:52,099
One day, your luck is going
to run out, cowboy.

185
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:55,869
I should have done it alone.

186
00:13:55,903 --> 00:13:57,338
He'll pull through.

187
00:13:58,472 --> 00:14:03,110
Listen,
we are outgunned, outpaced.

188
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:07,281
The only way to catch
this crew is in the act.

189
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:09,517
You got a theory?
Yeah.

190
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:12,953
Those guys are smart, trained.

191
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:16,223
I mean, all they stole
is just a bit of cash

192
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:19,594
and an old deck
of baseball training cards.

193
00:14:19,627 --> 00:14:22,329
Smart people don't rob banks.

194
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:24,566
Yeah, true that.

195
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:27,434
This crew is tight.
And they move like a team.

196
00:14:27,468 --> 00:14:29,203
Hmm.

197
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:30,270
Yeah, but...

198
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:32,272
Athletes.

199
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:35,309
<i>The guard said he got
truck stick trying to escape.</i>

200
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:38,312
That tracks.

201
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:40,981
You know,
the rest of the team think

202
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:43,417
that I'm crazier than you
for thinking like this,

203
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,686
but hear me out.

204
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:46,387
Those guys are not from here.

205
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:51,258
One of the witnesses said that
they speak with a New York accent.

206
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,426
So?

207
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:54,596
Have you heard
of phantom planes?

208
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:56,063
The Phantom?

209
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:59,400
The one in the purple suit
with the dog?

210
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:01,969
I'm talking about planes.

211
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:04,539
Phantom planes.

212
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:09,042
They fly around the country
with no manifests, no record.

213
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:11,979
They go from one city to
the next one, pick up people.

214
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:18,952
Now, there are a couple of jobs
around the country that fits the MO.

215
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:22,055
The Miami Credit Union
two months ago.

216
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:24,224
The Fenway Currency Exchange.

217
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:26,728
The Austin crypto hit.

218
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:29,597
The FAA logs tail numbers.

219
00:15:30,532 --> 00:15:32,966
There was only one plane

220
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,538
that was in the same city
as all those jobs.

221
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:40,608
The plane is registered
to a New York shell company

222
00:15:40,642 --> 00:15:43,277
that goes by... by Winna.

223
00:15:44,178 --> 00:15:45,212
Winna?

224
00:15:50,785 --> 00:15:52,453
Shit.
You know him?

225
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:54,388
Mm-hmm. He's a bookie.

226
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:56,023
Hmm.

227
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:58,058
That's not our jurisdiction.

228
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:00,628
But I can make a call
and get some information.

229
00:16:03,531 --> 00:16:04,965
Where the fuck you going?

230
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,502
New York.

231
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:09,504
Fuck.

232
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:32,159
I want to be
a Paw Patrol officer.

233
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:35,362
We got no pigs in this house.

234
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,565
They're not pigs.
They're dogs.

235
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:39,701
Do pigs have paws?

236
00:16:40,735 --> 00:16:43,538
No, they don't have paws.
They got those, uh...

237
00:16:43,571 --> 00:16:45,807
Babe, what do pigs have?

238
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,542
Hooves?
Hooves! Hooves.

239
00:16:47,575 --> 00:16:49,711
Yeah, they got those hooves.

240
00:16:49,744 --> 00:16:52,279
What about a Gyptian mummy?

241
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:53,515
Gyp... Egyptian.

242
00:16:53,548 --> 00:16:55,015
Come on, say that.

243
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:58,620
E-gyp-tian.

244
00:16:58,653 --> 00:17:00,120
Egyptian.

245
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:02,489
Gyptian.
That's close enough.

246
00:17:02,524 --> 00:17:05,760
Okay. Hey, we'll pick out
a costume once I get back.

247
00:17:05,793 --> 00:17:08,128
All right? Love you.

248
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:11,164
You got another thing there.
Give me a headbutt.

249
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:12,332
Love ya.
Love you too.

250
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:13,568
Bye.

251
00:17:13,601 --> 00:17:15,737
You going on a grocery run?

252
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,071
Oh, let's
just get takeout, yeah?

253
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:19,774
I read too much grease
is bad for kids.

254
00:17:19,807 --> 00:17:23,310
Okay, groceries it is.
You got cash?

255
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:26,446
Uh, no. The foreman owes me
a check. I'm gonna go pick it up.

256
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,516
Where?
Where?

257
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,417
Where are you going?

258
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,687
The site. I'm gonna go
get it at the job site.

259
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,756
The one by Broadway?
Yeah.

260
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:36,323
The construction job?

261
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:38,660
Yes. The construction job.

262
00:17:38,693 --> 00:17:40,628
Hmm. That's strange,

263
00:17:40,662 --> 00:17:42,830
'cause there isn't a construction
going on on that block.

264
00:17:42,864 --> 00:17:44,699
Yeah, it's right by it.

265
00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:46,601
I drove by yesterday,

266
00:17:46,634 --> 00:17:48,736
'cause Clara wanted to see
her dad at work. Jesus Christ.

267
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,471
I want to know where the
father of my child is going.

268
00:17:51,506 --> 00:17:53,440
Is that... Is that so
wrong? I'm working.

269
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:54,474
On what?

270
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:56,744
On providing for this family.

271
00:17:56,778 --> 00:17:59,681
Casey, you can't provide for this
family if you're in a fucking jail cell.

272
00:17:59,714 --> 00:18:02,517
Oh, no. I can't provide for this family
with a nine-to-five, darling. Okay?

273
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,685
That's not enough. Right?
Hmm.

274
00:18:03,718 --> 00:18:05,185
Look, I'm not asking for much.

275
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:06,486
Oh, that's bullshit.

276
00:18:06,521 --> 00:18:07,622
Bullshit?
Bullshit!

277
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:08,723
- Bullshit?
- Yeah!

278
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:10,825
You love that old lifestyle.

279
00:18:10,858 --> 00:18:13,260
You married a quarterback
who can't play football anymore.

280
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,563
Okay? Poor woman, having
to slum it with a has-been.

281
00:18:15,597 --> 00:18:18,800
But this is what you got.
This is the real world, okay?

282
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:22,135
I bust my ass for you,
and I am here.

283
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:23,838
You're here?
Yes, I'm here.

284
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,373
You think you're here?
No, you're not fucking here.

285
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:27,909
Half the time,
you're on pain pills.

286
00:18:27,942 --> 00:18:29,544
You're like a fucking zombie.

287
00:18:30,344 --> 00:18:31,512
And I-I understand.

288
00:18:31,546 --> 00:18:33,413
I see what you
put your body through,

289
00:18:34,949 --> 00:18:37,785
but you're a fucking
drug addict, Casey.

290
00:18:38,686 --> 00:18:39,787
That's nice.

291
00:18:39,821 --> 00:18:41,188
It's the truth.

292
00:18:42,724 --> 00:18:44,692
Hey, darling. Hey.

293
00:18:44,726 --> 00:18:46,861
Hi, hey. I'm sorry...
Ugh.

294
00:18:46,894 --> 00:18:47,929
It's okay.

295
00:18:47,962 --> 00:18:49,864
...that Daddy's screaming.

296
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:53,367
Did you ever call
Coach Cogburn back?

297
00:18:54,936 --> 00:18:59,406
Um, no. I'm not working
for $18 an hour. All right?

298
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:03,544
Then Daddy would have to work for 90
hours a day... and that's not possible...

299
00:19:03,578 --> 00:19:05,445
So I could provide for you.

300
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,582
To provide for me?

301
00:19:07,615 --> 00:19:09,249
Yeah. Yeah,
you know what I mean.

302
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:11,318
You know what I mean.

303
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:12,620
Yeah, yeah.

304
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:18,793
Come here, okay?
Hey, I...

305
00:19:19,994 --> 00:19:22,396
I love you. I'm sorry.
I just...

306
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:23,798
I love you, okay?

307
00:19:23,831 --> 00:19:25,566
No. You love getting
under my skin.

308
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,668
It's true.

309
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:27,935
Hi!

310
00:19:27,969 --> 00:19:29,336
Hi.

311
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:32,674
Look, I really just
don't need anything more

312
00:19:32,707 --> 00:19:34,509
than what we have right here.

313
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:39,413
Okay?

314
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:44,652
You watch your mama
while I'm gone. Okay.

315
00:19:44,686 --> 00:19:46,253
Okay?

316
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:47,889
We'll pick out some costumes.

317
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:50,190
We'll pick 'em
when I get back. All right.

318
00:19:51,793 --> 00:19:52,794
Okay.

319
00:19:53,895 --> 00:19:55,763
Go eat your
sandwich, okay? Okay.

320
00:19:55,797 --> 00:19:56,831
Okay.

321
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:02,830
How's the knee, sausage?

322
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:06,634
Uh, it's pretty awful,
but thank you for asking.

323
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:09,971
You know, I got some Tiger Balm
if you wanna, uh, rub me up.

324
00:21:10,004 --> 00:21:12,673
You'd like that?
Oh, I really, really would.

325
00:21:12,707 --> 00:21:14,041
Hmm.

326
00:21:15,977 --> 00:21:17,377
You know the rules.

327
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,346
Help goes around back, okay?

328
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:21,414
Your breath, man,
it's disgusting.

329
00:21:25,787 --> 00:21:28,790
Arch your back.
Loosen your grip.

330
00:21:29,624 --> 00:21:32,492
And when you're ready,
just take a swing.

331
00:21:32,527 --> 00:21:33,761
Nice!

332
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,665
So you think you're funny?

333
00:21:37,698 --> 00:21:38,766
Not... Not really.

334
00:21:39,534 --> 00:21:41,702
Get out of here.
It's business time.

335
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,408
- Yeah, uh, golf? Not really your sport.
- Oh.

336
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:50,945
Have you ever considered,
uh, power walking?

337
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:52,747
Oh, so you are funny.

338
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,749
Brigga, punch him.

339
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:03,991
- Did you do it yet?
- Now that's out of the way, tell me all about it.

340
00:22:04,025 --> 00:22:06,027
Um, how'd it go?

341
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,830
Uh...

342
00:22:08,863 --> 00:22:11,398
- It was nothing but a good time, man.
- Yeah?

343
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:13,366
Yeah. Exciting.
You got the money?

344
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,636
I got the money.
Here you go, every cent.

345
00:22:16,737 --> 00:22:17,772
Brigga.

346
00:22:19,574 --> 00:22:21,108
Tell me more. Right?

347
00:22:21,142 --> 00:22:23,611
Show me the dailies,
as they say. Go.

348
00:22:23,644 --> 00:22:26,147
Better than any touchdown.

349
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:30,051
That's what I'm talking about. A
man who's passionate about his work.

350
00:22:30,084 --> 00:22:33,054
All right, real talk now.
Coach and the captain.

351
00:22:33,621 --> 00:22:35,422
I did see the fireworks.

352
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,558
Yeah, we got it done.
No.

353
00:22:37,592 --> 00:22:40,862
No, what you got was heat.

354
00:22:40,895 --> 00:22:43,430
The cops want both our heads now
for lighting up that detective.

355
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:45,099
- Yeah? So what? Who cares?
- So what?

356
00:22:45,132 --> 00:22:47,134
Hazard of the job.
Oh, hazard of the job?

357
00:22:47,168 --> 00:22:50,738
- Yeah, hazard of the job. You have some rats on the force.
- What of it?

358
00:22:50,771 --> 00:22:53,941
So what's their take?
Anyone ID us? Not that I heard.

359
00:22:55,142 --> 00:22:56,944
But if you can stand the heat,

360
00:22:58,779 --> 00:23:00,848
I might have another job
for you.

361
00:23:00,882 --> 00:23:01,949
Yeah.

362
00:23:04,752 --> 00:23:06,687
Come on, take it.

363
00:23:14,862 --> 00:23:16,163
Come on.
Nah.

364
00:23:16,197 --> 00:23:18,199
They say it'll sell
for $1.2 million.

365
00:23:18,232 --> 00:23:20,968
$1.2 million.
That's extraordinary, right?

366
00:23:21,002 --> 00:23:22,870
Think about it.
If you can get that,

367
00:23:22,904 --> 00:23:25,106
that's like 200K each
for you and your crew.

368
00:23:26,941 --> 00:23:27,975
250.

369
00:23:28,009 --> 00:23:29,577
250 times five, do the math.

370
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,079
I should just buy
the thing myself. 220.

371
00:23:32,113 --> 00:23:34,916
I'm not working with
Mercer. Three-man team this time.

372
00:23:34,949 --> 00:23:36,617
It's not my problem.

373
00:23:37,551 --> 00:23:38,986
All right.
All right?

374
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,721
Yeah. Get the money ready.
Get the fuck out of here.

375
00:23:40,755 --> 00:23:41,889
All right.
All right, go.

376
00:23:46,027 --> 00:23:47,595
Bring back the girl.

377
00:23:55,169 --> 00:23:58,606
Yeah, I'm just finishing up
here, and I'll be home in a little bit.

378
00:23:59,206 --> 00:24:01,474
No, that's okay.
Perfect.

379
00:24:02,243 --> 00:24:03,611
Bye.

380
00:24:28,703 --> 00:24:29,870
Come on.
Not now.

381
00:24:29,904 --> 00:24:31,038
All right.

382
00:24:43,818 --> 00:24:45,152
Hey.

383
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:48,089
What's up, Dave?
How you doing?

384
00:24:50,725 --> 00:24:52,693
Hey, champ. What's
up, brother? Hey, man.

385
00:24:52,727 --> 00:24:54,895
What the fuck is this?
What, I can't have a party?

386
00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:57,231
How the fuck does a guy
who got dropped by the Mets

387
00:24:57,264 --> 00:24:59,066
and hauls scrap
at his dad's junkyard

388
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,801
pay for a party like this, huh?

389
00:25:00,835 --> 00:25:03,771
First rule, right?
Don't flash your fucking cash.

390
00:25:03,804 --> 00:25:06,674
What did you do... What did you do
with your cash? Thanks for asking.

391
00:25:06,707 --> 00:25:09,076
I'm saving it, so I can get the
fuck out of this neighborhood

392
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,711
and buy new friends.

393
00:25:11,445 --> 00:25:14,048
Dude, I don't want you
to go to jail.

394
00:25:14,081 --> 00:25:15,950
All right, all right.

395
00:25:15,983 --> 00:25:19,587
But we're here. It's a party.
Enjoy it, man. Have a beer.

396
00:25:20,621 --> 00:25:22,656
You're freaking me out.
Jesus.

397
00:25:25,693 --> 00:25:27,128
Hi, Ms. Kandinsky.

398
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:29,997
What did Winna say?

399
00:25:30,031 --> 00:25:31,065
Um...

400
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:34,101
Winna said we did good work.

401
00:25:34,135 --> 00:25:36,771
And that we maybe have
some heat for the cop thing.

402
00:25:36,804 --> 00:25:40,775
But the cop didn't die,

403
00:25:40,808 --> 00:25:42,977
so, you know,
it should blow over.

404
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:45,346
That come from his rat?

405
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:47,815
No. They didn't ID
any of us and they won't

406
00:25:47,848 --> 00:25:50,684
as long as we keep our mouths
shut and don't throw fucking parties.

407
00:25:53,654 --> 00:25:55,756
Uh, but I got
some good news. Hey.

408
00:25:57,024 --> 00:25:58,859
Hi there.

409
00:25:58,893 --> 00:26:01,362
Uh, Winna's got another gig
lined up for us. Oh, come on.

410
00:26:01,395 --> 00:26:03,898
I'm in. Why do you want to
keep working with this guy?

411
00:26:03,931 --> 00:26:06,634
'Cause he's given us
five gigs in five months.

412
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:10,938
Uh, he's got a jet to fly us
anywhere, take any heist anytime.

413
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:13,808
And did I mention the part
that we're getting 220?

414
00:26:13,841 --> 00:26:16,811
Whoa, 220?
220.

415
00:26:16,844 --> 00:26:20,614
What about the fucking cop? Enough
with the fucking cop. Please, okay?

416
00:26:20,648 --> 00:26:22,149
He didn't die, right?
He's okay.

417
00:26:22,183 --> 00:26:24,085
Gonna get paid.
It's gonna be fine.

418
00:26:24,118 --> 00:26:26,020
Yeah. maybe... maybe
we did him a favor.

419
00:26:26,053 --> 00:26:28,923
Okay, maybe not a favor, but...

420
00:26:28,956 --> 00:26:30,858
That guy was doing his job.

421
00:26:30,891 --> 00:26:32,760
So were we, okay?

422
00:26:32,793 --> 00:26:34,962
Suddenly, you're a bank
robber with a heart of gold?

423
00:26:36,664 --> 00:26:38,699
Casey pulled the trigger,
but we're all still guilty.

424
00:26:38,732 --> 00:26:40,167
Just wanna let you know that.

425
00:26:40,201 --> 00:26:42,937
You're all fucked.
You're all so fucked.

426
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:46,040
So go see a priest and
confess. Just not at my party.

427
00:26:46,073 --> 00:26:48,976
Look, Sykes, if you've just gone up
and grown a conscience, that's fine.

428
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:51,278
You can walk.
I'm not gonna stop you.

429
00:26:53,314 --> 00:26:55,082
But I want you.

430
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,722
Shut the fuck up and just
tell me what the score is.

431
00:27:04,425 --> 00:27:06,760
Check this out.

432
00:27:06,794 --> 00:27:08,696
Oh, come on.

433
00:27:08,729 --> 00:27:10,030
Here.

434
00:27:10,064 --> 00:27:12,066
Oh, shit.

435
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:14,368
No, we're gonna
die. For real. Fuck off.

436
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,905
No. One-of-a-kind
collector's item

437
00:27:17,938 --> 00:27:20,107
that sells at an auction.

438
00:27:20,141 --> 00:27:23,677
Guys, um, we do this job, right?

439
00:27:23,711 --> 00:27:26,380
We're gonna have a nice
little deposit for our pensions.

440
00:27:28,716 --> 00:27:31,285
Come on. I've seen it.
I got it all in my head.

441
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:33,387
I know all the angles.
We can do this.

442
00:27:36,056 --> 00:27:38,058
I'm gonna pass
unless I have my team.

443
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:40,394
What about Mercer?

444
00:27:40,427 --> 00:27:42,763
Fuck Mercer, okay?

445
00:27:42,796 --> 00:27:45,900
I got one fucking cowboy right
here. I don't know about Mercer.

446
00:27:48,068 --> 00:27:49,470
Fine.
I'm in.

447
00:27:49,504 --> 00:27:51,906
Let's go steal Wayne
Gretzky. Have a salami.

448
00:27:51,939 --> 00:27:53,240
Fuck you.
Fuck off.

449
00:27:53,274 --> 00:27:55,109
You couldn't afford a heater?

450
00:27:58,445 --> 00:28:02,917
Every move should
improve your position or hurt the enemy.

451
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:06,053
This is a battlefield. And
never forget why you're fighting.

452
00:28:07,922 --> 00:28:09,423
Now, the knight.

453
00:28:09,456 --> 00:28:11,759
The knight is the most
dangerous piece on the board.

454
00:28:12,693 --> 00:28:15,296
The knight can strike
when you least expect it.

455
00:28:17,264 --> 00:28:20,134
The knight moves in ways
most people won't understand.

456
00:28:27,074 --> 00:28:30,411
Now, what the hell? How the fuck
did you... Where the fuck is my security?

457
00:28:30,444 --> 00:28:31,845
Where's Brigga?

458
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:34,014
I hope I'm not, uh,
interrupting.

459
00:28:34,048 --> 00:28:37,151
Detective, you're a long way
from home, you know that?

460
00:28:37,184 --> 00:28:39,286
- Who are you?
- San go.

461
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,921
Oh, gesundheit.

462
00:28:40,955 --> 00:28:43,490
Welcome to my humble fortress.

463
00:28:43,525 --> 00:28:46,160
- Nice place for a bookie.
- Thanks.

464
00:28:46,193 --> 00:28:48,362
Yeah, we say if there's
a sport with a winner,

465
00:28:48,395 --> 00:28:50,965
then there's also a loser
that was willing to bet on it.

466
00:28:50,998 --> 00:28:53,367
- We need a word.
- You need a word? I got a word.

467
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,401
"Lawyer."

468
00:28:54,435 --> 00:28:55,936
Lawyer?

469
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:58,506
I got four more words.
"Speak to my lawyer."

470
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,475
As you can see, I'm in
the middle of a lesson here.

471
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:06,548
Do you know who this is? This is
the youngest chess master in history.

472
00:29:06,581 --> 00:29:08,048
Well, good for him.

473
00:29:08,082 --> 00:29:11,085
Hey, this is my home.
All right?

474
00:29:11,118 --> 00:29:12,186
Show some respect.

475
00:29:12,219 --> 00:29:14,288
I apologize for these clowns.

476
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:18,058
Hey, kid, go learn a real sport.

477
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,362
Sit.

478
00:29:24,265 --> 00:29:26,400
Now, detectives, talk to me.

479
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:28,435
What can I do you for?

480
00:29:28,469 --> 00:29:30,838
We know all about you, Winna.

481
00:29:30,871 --> 00:29:33,307
Kicked out of Goldman Sachs
for insider trading.

482
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:36,176
Got a sweetheart deal
with the judge.

483
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:40,080
You were a CI
for the local PD and feds.

484
00:29:40,114 --> 00:29:42,983
Oh, so you found
my Wikipedia page, did you?

485
00:29:43,017 --> 00:29:46,453
And I'm glad to see the government's
finally hiring guys who can read.

486
00:29:46,487 --> 00:29:50,024
So tell me, if I turn
your pockets inside out,

487
00:29:50,057 --> 00:29:51,258
what am I going to find?

488
00:29:51,292 --> 00:29:53,360
I don't know.
What will you find?

489
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:56,964
Perhaps a lawsuit for
breaching my civil liberties?

490
00:29:56,997 --> 00:29:58,365
Really?
Yeah.

491
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,301
You know a lot of ex-pros.

492
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:02,002
Make some scratch.

493
00:30:02,036 --> 00:30:03,904
Yep.

494
00:30:03,937 --> 00:30:05,973
I'd like a
couple of them for a messy job.

495
00:30:06,006 --> 00:30:08,342
A messy drug job.

496
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:11,078
You know anything
about that? No.

497
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:12,880
Not to the best
of my recollection.

498
00:30:13,515 --> 00:30:14,815
Think real hard.

499
00:30:15,449 --> 00:30:17,017
And what's in it for me?

500
00:30:17,051 --> 00:30:18,986
Christmas dinner at my place.

501
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:20,154
Oh, yeah?

502
00:30:21,088 --> 00:30:22,289
I think I'll pass.

503
00:30:22,323 --> 00:30:25,092
Well, better
than the alternative.

504
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:26,528
And what's that?

505
00:30:26,561 --> 00:30:28,996
You have dinner at his.

506
00:30:31,131 --> 00:30:32,600
You know, call ahead next time.

507
00:30:32,634 --> 00:30:35,002
I'll make sure
the gates are locked.

508
00:30:35,035 --> 00:30:39,006
If you're covering for them,
I'll find out.

509
00:30:41,108 --> 00:30:42,876
Now, is that a threat,
Detective?

510
00:30:44,978 --> 00:30:46,914
Got a lot of property here.

511
00:30:48,315 --> 00:30:53,053
Lot of places
to get lost, disappear.

512
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:56,490
Lot of places.

513
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,494
We're done.

514
00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:02,930
Get out.

515
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:31,125
Wait here.

516
00:31:42,637 --> 00:31:44,672
What the fuck
are you doing here?

517
00:31:45,472 --> 00:31:46,940
What do you got?

518
00:31:49,143 --> 00:31:50,177
What do I got?

519
00:31:52,614 --> 00:31:54,982
What about the truck heist?

520
00:31:55,015 --> 00:31:58,285
I don't know anything about it,
but if I did know something about it...

521
00:32:00,254 --> 00:32:01,422
I would look at Casey Rhodes.

522
00:32:01,455 --> 00:32:03,056
Casey Rhodes?

523
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,626
Yeah, look to him.

524
00:32:07,629 --> 00:32:10,197
Yeah, where can I find him?

525
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,499
I'm not gonna do your
fucking job for you, buddy.

526
00:32:12,534 --> 00:32:15,335
And I shouldn't have to explain
why this can't come back to Winna.

527
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:17,004
<i>Don't forget.</i>

528
00:32:17,037 --> 00:32:18,506
You still owe him.

529
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,308
Is that a fact?

530
00:32:22,644 --> 00:32:25,112
Yeah. It's a fact.

531
00:32:25,145 --> 00:32:27,080
Now get the fuck outta here.

532
00:32:43,798 --> 00:32:45,265
Yo, you got my stuff?
Yeah.

533
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:46,333
Yeah.

534
00:32:46,366 --> 00:32:48,202
Any news on the next one?

535
00:32:48,235 --> 00:32:50,705
Uh, nothing yet.
I'll let you know.

536
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:56,009
No serial numbers.
Complete virgin.

537
00:32:56,811 --> 00:32:59,547
Not for long.
Yes.

538
00:32:59,581 --> 00:33:01,616
All right. Let's get the fuck
outta here, yeah? Sure.

539
00:33:01,649 --> 00:33:03,350
Casey Rhodes.

540
00:33:05,352 --> 00:33:07,354
- Give that to...
- I'm not going back to jail, man.

541
00:33:07,387 --> 00:33:09,223
You're not gonna...
If they had anything on us...

542
00:33:09,256 --> 00:33:10,725
Lose it behind
your fucking back.

543
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,729
Can I help you?

544
00:33:14,762 --> 00:33:16,330
Can I see some ID?

545
00:33:18,065 --> 00:33:20,033
You know,
I think I left it at home.

546
00:33:20,067 --> 00:33:22,336
What about you? Do you,
uh... Do you have your ID?

547
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:25,138
Yeah, I think
I left mine at home too.

548
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:26,373
I know who you are.

549
00:33:27,274 --> 00:33:29,476
Casey Rhodes.
And?

550
00:33:29,511 --> 00:33:31,411
Rookie of the year.

551
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:34,147
Drafted by the Chargers.

552
00:33:34,949 --> 00:33:36,718
That's a really good memory,
pops.

553
00:33:38,085 --> 00:33:39,721
Numbers are good?

554
00:33:39,754 --> 00:33:41,288
Astronomical.

555
00:33:41,321 --> 00:33:43,156
The next Tom Brady.

556
00:33:43,858 --> 00:33:47,060
Lost a lot of money.
Went bankrupt.

557
00:33:47,094 --> 00:33:48,730
Oh, I've heard about you.

558
00:33:48,763 --> 00:33:51,064
Didn't you get banned
for shaving points?

559
00:33:51,098 --> 00:33:52,534
Yeah, you want
a fuckin' autograph?

560
00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:56,804
Get in the fucking car.
Let's go.

561
00:33:57,739 --> 00:33:59,273
Knight.

562
00:34:03,343 --> 00:34:04,712
<i>Knight, help me.</i>

563
00:34:08,716 --> 00:34:10,417
Yeah, you want
a fuckin' autograph?

564
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:14,488
Knight, you okay?

565
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:20,562
I was talking about you,
not to you.

566
00:34:20,595 --> 00:34:23,230
Okay, now we have
a mutual friend. Winna.

567
00:34:23,263 --> 00:34:24,364
Uh, Winna.

568
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:26,466
Hmm. You guys...
You know Winna?

569
00:34:26,501 --> 00:34:28,268
It's a small world.

570
00:34:28,302 --> 00:34:31,405
Maybe we could all grab some
brunch or something sometime.

571
00:34:31,438 --> 00:34:33,273
Really nice.

572
00:34:33,307 --> 00:34:35,543
That's real cute.
What's your current address?

573
00:34:36,176 --> 00:34:37,344
Me?

574
00:34:37,377 --> 00:34:39,413
Uh, you got a pen?

575
00:34:39,446 --> 00:34:41,683
Okay. It's, uh,
just on the corner

576
00:34:41,716 --> 00:34:44,418
of, uh, "Speak to my"
and "Fuckin' lawyer."

577
00:34:44,451 --> 00:34:46,453
It's a new suburb.

578
00:34:46,486 --> 00:34:48,856
You're friends
with Winna, obviously.

579
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:51,258
He must train his dogs
really well.

580
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:52,760
Woof.

581
00:34:52,794 --> 00:34:56,229
Stay safe out there.
Be seeing you.

582
00:34:57,331 --> 00:34:58,666
You too.

583
00:35:19,687 --> 00:35:20,855
Captain. Captain Shea.

584
00:35:21,723 --> 00:35:23,390
Detective San go.
Mmm.

585
00:35:23,423 --> 00:35:25,425
Thanks for taking the time.
Where's your partner?

586
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:26,928
He's not my partner.

587
00:35:26,961 --> 00:35:28,763
What can I do for you,
Detective?

588
00:35:28,796 --> 00:35:31,532
We're here as a gesture
of goodwill.

589
00:35:31,566 --> 00:35:33,801
I was wondering if we
could share information.

590
00:35:33,835 --> 00:35:35,670
You're out of your jurisdiction.

591
00:35:36,904 --> 00:35:42,309
Captain, we have a cop who
is right now fighting for his life.

592
00:35:43,911 --> 00:35:47,649
Detective Knight had some leads
regarding some old friend of his.

593
00:35:47,682 --> 00:35:49,349
Andrew Winna.

594
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,819
Old friend?

595
00:35:51,853 --> 00:35:54,221
Yeah, he might have
been a bookie or CI.

596
00:35:54,254 --> 00:35:56,758
Just an old friend of Knight.

597
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:59,326
Does he know him
or "he knew him"?

598
00:36:01,294 --> 00:36:04,264
Knight might be
rough around the edges,

599
00:36:04,297 --> 00:36:05,767
but he's a good cop.

600
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,200
Mm-hmm.

601
00:36:07,234 --> 00:36:08,468
Got anything concrete?

602
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:12,239
Winna's head of security,
Brigga.

603
00:36:12,272 --> 00:36:14,241
He played football
with Casey Rhodes.

604
00:36:14,274 --> 00:36:15,743
I guess they had a falling out,

605
00:36:15,777 --> 00:36:18,646
because he implicated Casey
and his crew in the heist.

606
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,882
They cover their tracks
very well.

607
00:36:20,915 --> 00:36:23,551
Hit the target
and disappear like ghosts.

608
00:36:23,584 --> 00:36:25,853
Look, Detective,
I know your captain.

609
00:36:25,887 --> 00:36:28,255
She vouched for you,
but not your partner.

610
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,624
She sent me his file.

611
00:36:29,657 --> 00:36:32,392
It is the opinion
of the department

612
00:36:32,426 --> 00:36:34,662
that if James Knight
wasn't hunting bank robbers,

613
00:36:34,696 --> 00:36:36,496
he'd be robbing banks.

614
00:36:37,065 --> 00:36:38,966
He's a thug with a badge.

615
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,868
If they strike again,
I'll give you clearance.

616
00:36:40,902 --> 00:36:42,837
But stay out of our way.

617
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,639
Welcome to New York, Detective.

618
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:48,341
Have fun being a
tourist in my city. Mmm.

619
00:37:02,023 --> 00:37:04,692
That was in! Get the fuck
out of the way. That was in!

620
00:37:04,726 --> 00:37:06,861
What are you, blind?
Who the fuck is that ref, huh?

621
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:09,864
He's a dead man,
that's who he is.

622
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:13,400
You guys are good at what you do, all
right? You both work for me now, okay?

623
00:37:13,433 --> 00:37:15,737
25%, your take. No cutting
or I take it out in blood.

624
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:17,839
I'm kidding, but not really.

625
00:37:19,974 --> 00:37:21,509
What?

626
00:37:21,542 --> 00:37:23,611
It's Knight.
What the fuck does he want?

627
00:37:25,713 --> 00:37:27,280
Give me that phone.

628
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:31,284
What the fuck are you doing?

629
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:33,554
Why are you rolling on me
with that jamoke, huh?

630
00:37:33,588 --> 00:37:35,355
We have an understanding,
Detective.

631
00:37:35,388 --> 00:37:37,625
<i>Stay away, or else.</i>

632
00:37:37,658 --> 00:37:39,426
<i>They got him on life support.</i>

633
00:37:39,459 --> 00:37:42,730
Oh, okay. Well, hazard of the
job. Send him some flowers.

634
00:37:42,764 --> 00:37:44,397
Who shot him?

635
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:46,366
<i>How the fuck would I know
who shot some guy</i>

636
00:37:46,399 --> 00:37:47,502
<i>in your dirty little city?</i>

637
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:49,604
<i>We spoke to him.</i>

638
00:37:49,637 --> 00:37:52,372
Yeah, Casey Rhodes.
And his buddy.

639
00:37:54,675 --> 00:37:56,677
They're both stand-up guys.

640
00:37:56,711 --> 00:37:59,346
We both agreed not to ask questions
that we don't want answers to.

641
00:37:59,379 --> 00:38:01,516
<i>If I get the evidence
that Rhodes shot Fitz...</i>

642
00:38:01,549 --> 00:38:04,852
Uh-uh. Watch that tone,
Detective.

643
00:38:04,886 --> 00:38:07,755
<i>I could always call IA and let
them know about our little chat.</i>

644
00:38:07,789 --> 00:38:10,558
<i>We threatening
each other now?</i> No.

645
00:38:10,591 --> 00:38:13,594
No, we are not.
Now, listen to me.

646
00:38:13,628 --> 00:38:17,565
Back off from Rhodes and Mercer.

647
00:38:17,598 --> 00:38:19,767
<i>If I find out you had
anything to do with this...</i>

648
00:38:19,801 --> 00:38:22,804
Oh, so much plot and excitement.

649
00:38:22,837 --> 00:38:24,906
Listen to me. No more
empty threats, Detective.

650
00:38:24,939 --> 00:38:26,974
I can take you out
whenever I want,

651
00:38:27,008 --> 00:38:29,010
<i>wherever I want, okay?</i>

652
00:38:29,043 --> 00:38:32,046
If you don't believe me, I'd
love to give you a demonstration.

653
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,015
Fitz is still in the ICU, right?

654
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:36,416
One call from me,

655
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:38,385
I'll have him moved
to the morgue. Bye.

656
00:38:54,502 --> 00:38:55,736
And the good news?

657
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:58,739
Uh, you're late.

658
00:38:58,773 --> 00:39:02,375
How 'bout getting a fucking
watch? You find the blueprints?

659
00:39:02,409 --> 00:39:06,647
Yeah. But I did some digging
on those cops that paid you a visit.

660
00:39:08,149 --> 00:39:09,951
Anything good?

661
00:39:09,984 --> 00:39:14,889
Yeah. So first up, we have
Detective God win Frensaw San go.

662
00:39:14,922 --> 00:39:17,525
Analyst with the CIA
for seven years.

663
00:39:17,558 --> 00:39:21,095
He settled down in LA,
made detective in a year.

664
00:39:21,128 --> 00:39:23,396
- In a year?
- Yeah.

665
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:26,667
That's good. What about
the other guy? The bald guy.

666
00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:28,903
The other bald one?

667
00:39:28,936 --> 00:39:30,671
Uh-huh.

668
00:39:30,705 --> 00:39:32,940
So that's Detective
James Edward Knight.

669
00:39:32,974 --> 00:39:35,009
He served in the marines,
got out after a tour,

670
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:37,578
met his wife and had a kid.

671
00:39:37,612 --> 00:39:38,646
Guess where.

672
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:40,447
In the back of his car?

673
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,683
No, dumb-ass. Newark.

674
00:39:44,118 --> 00:39:47,054
This says here that he
made detective in two years.

675
00:39:47,088 --> 00:39:49,924
And then here's where it gets,
like, super interesting.

676
00:39:49,957 --> 00:39:53,160
Nine years ago, Knight is
transferred to Los Angeles.

677
00:39:53,194 --> 00:39:54,896
Why?

678
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:57,064
This all starts with
a guy named Jerry Leach,

679
00:39:57,098 --> 00:40:00,201
an ex-con who the cops liked for killing a
bank manager during an armed robbery.

680
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:02,169
<i>Fast forward a few years later,</i>

681
00:40:02,203 --> 00:40:04,705
IA investigated Knight's
involvement in an off-duty shooting.

682
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:06,207
The victim, Jerry Leach.

683
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,042
And who was
the unlucky bank manager?

684
00:40:08,075 --> 00:40:10,611
Knight's old man,
William Knight.

685
00:40:10,645 --> 00:40:13,881
But here's the craziest part. Guess who the
last person to see Jerry Leach alive was?

686
00:40:13,915 --> 00:40:14,949
- Winna?
- Yeah.

687
00:40:14,982 --> 00:40:16,717
Winna was a CI.

688
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:18,953
He must have tipped off Knight
to Leach's whereabouts

689
00:40:18,986 --> 00:40:21,088
in exchange
for owning Knight a favor.

690
00:40:21,122 --> 00:40:23,456
Witnesses claimed
they didn't see anything,

691
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:25,126
the IA always leaning
towards Knight.

692
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:28,062
They made a deal to send him
out west just to get rid of him.

693
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:29,997
Since then, Knight had
caught some big cases.

694
00:40:30,031 --> 00:40:32,700
But he got divorced and seems
to have some disciplinary hearing

695
00:40:32,733 --> 00:40:34,467
at least once a year.

696
00:40:34,502 --> 00:40:36,469
Boo-hoo.

697
00:40:36,504 --> 00:40:38,172
I don't think we should
get between these guys,

698
00:40:38,205 --> 00:40:40,741
especially with this Knight guy
wanting Casey's head.

699
00:40:42,043 --> 00:40:45,146
If they had anything on us,
we'd be in cuffs right now, right?

700
00:40:46,814 --> 00:40:48,115
So we proceed.

701
00:40:49,517 --> 00:40:50,551
Blueprints.

702
00:40:50,584 --> 00:40:52,053
Right.

703
00:40:53,921 --> 00:40:57,858
So the good news is,
there are plenty of exit points.

704
00:40:57,892 --> 00:41:01,128
All right, which means there's plenty
of places for us to get caught, right?

705
00:41:01,162 --> 00:41:02,964
- Right.
- From the top.

706
00:41:03,998 --> 00:41:06,167
7:07, red carpet ends.

707
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,737
Okay, 7:09, one of us enters
through the lobby, dressed as a server.

708
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:13,541
- 7:25, the auction begins.
- 7:30, we cut the lights.

709
00:41:13,574 --> 00:41:15,776
7:31, the snatch goes down.

710
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:17,745
7:32, we all meet
at the getaway car.

711
00:41:17,778 --> 00:41:20,715
And by 7:33, we're all dead

712
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:23,818
or rich as fuck.

713
00:41:25,052 --> 00:41:26,554
Fuck yeah.

714
00:41:26,587 --> 00:41:28,522
Now the last thing
we have to decide,

715
00:41:29,657 --> 00:41:31,491
which one of us makes the grab?

716
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,631
<i>All right, Mike.</i>

717
00:41:37,665 --> 00:41:38,966
You're first up. Let's go.

718
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,802
All right.

719
00:41:41,836 --> 00:41:43,070
On you.
Here we go.

720
00:41:48,242 --> 00:41:49,844
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

721
00:41:56,317 --> 00:41:57,952
No.

722
00:41:57,985 --> 00:42:01,088
- How was that?
- No, horrible. Again.

723
00:42:01,122 --> 00:42:03,157
Alarm will sound
as soon as you snatch it.

724
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,326
You got 30 seconds
to get to the getaway car.

725
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,329
Well, if this was real surface,
things would be different.

726
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:10,331
Yeah, no shit.

727
00:42:10,364 --> 00:42:13,034
If you can execute here, you have
no excuse to screw it up on the day.

728
00:42:13,067 --> 00:42:14,135
All right.
Let's go.

729
00:42:23,044 --> 00:42:24,311
Nice.

730
00:42:24,345 --> 00:42:25,980
Go, go, go, go.

731
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,892
- No.
- Nothing?

732
00:42:37,925 --> 00:42:39,794
No. Not even close.

733
00:42:39,827 --> 00:42:42,063
- All right, move aside. I'm up.
- Come on.

734
00:42:44,698 --> 00:42:45,733
All right, ready?

735
00:42:49,003 --> 00:42:50,838
Go!
Yeah!

736
00:42:50,871 --> 00:42:53,607
Come on, come on,
come on, come on. Come and get it.

737
00:42:53,641 --> 00:42:55,376
Hit the corner.
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

738
00:42:55,409 --> 00:42:57,378
Ow! Ow, fuck!

739
00:42:57,411 --> 00:42:59,013
Go, go, go, go, go.

740
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,218
Ugh.

741
00:43:04,251 --> 00:43:05,286
No. Time.

742
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:07,388
We gotta get this.
Mike!

743
00:43:07,421 --> 00:43:09,857
Come on!
All right. Take a breath.

744
00:43:10,858 --> 00:43:11,959
Ready? And go!

745
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:18,265
Come on, come on, come
on, come. Go, go, go, go.

746
00:43:23,804 --> 00:43:25,339
Come on.

747
00:43:25,372 --> 00:43:26,874
Time.

748
00:43:26,907 --> 00:43:28,075
Ugh!

749
00:43:28,109 --> 00:43:29,643
How was that?

750
00:43:30,311 --> 00:43:31,378
No.

751
00:43:31,412 --> 00:43:32,947
God.

752
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,248
We gotta get this.

753
00:43:37,251 --> 00:43:38,385
You're up.

754
00:43:38,419 --> 00:43:41,055
Okay.
Thought you'd never ask.

755
00:43:41,088 --> 00:43:42,223
Quickly.

756
00:43:47,428 --> 00:43:48,696
We're fucked.

757
00:43:50,331 --> 00:43:52,199
Ready?
Ready.

758
00:43:52,233 --> 00:43:53,267
Go.

759
00:44:08,282 --> 00:44:10,718
Whoa, whoa. Hopefully...

760
00:44:13,387 --> 00:44:14,855
How'd I do?

761
00:44:14,889 --> 00:44:15,990
How did you do that?

762
00:44:16,023 --> 00:44:18,125
Anticipate the turns.

763
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:20,227
You're right.
We got too much muscle.

764
00:44:20,261 --> 00:44:21,896
Okay, nobody ever said that.

765
00:44:23,797 --> 00:44:27,935
- You think you're up for this?
- Yeah. Yeah.

766
00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:30,070
Okay.

767
00:44:30,104 --> 00:44:31,071
All right.
Okay.

768
00:44:31,105 --> 00:44:32,740
Set.

769
00:44:32,773 --> 00:44:34,074
Do it blindfolded.

770
00:45:19,853 --> 00:45:21,322
Our auction will begin shortly.

771
00:45:21,355 --> 00:45:23,958
Please start to find your way
to your seats.

772
00:45:31,832 --> 00:45:34,168
How do I look?

773
00:45:34,201 --> 00:45:36,437
Like Tom Cruise
wants his mask back.

774
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:38,038
Let's go with that.
Let's go.

775
00:45:49,984 --> 00:45:52,453
The auction will begin
in two minutes. Two minutes.

776
00:45:52,486 --> 00:45:54,221
Please, everyone,
take your seats.

777
00:47:14,101 --> 00:47:16,538
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
I am Maxwell Wyatt.

778
00:47:16,571 --> 00:47:19,306
Tonight, you may walk home
with a piece of sports history.

779
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:21,241
Without further ado,
our first item.

780
00:47:21,275 --> 00:47:22,577
1,000, 1,000.

781
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:24,311
For 10,000.

782
00:47:24,345 --> 00:47:25,879
$10,000.

783
00:47:25,913 --> 00:47:27,414
Do I have $25,000?

784
00:47:29,651 --> 00:47:31,218
Who the fuck is that?

785
00:48:00,214 --> 00:48:01,315
How are we lookin'?

786
00:48:01,348 --> 00:48:03,384
I am fan-fucking-tastic.

787
00:48:03,417 --> 00:48:05,520
Now shut up
and let me do my job.

788
00:48:05,553 --> 00:48:08,021
<i>Copy.</i>
Thank you.

789
00:48:08,055 --> 00:48:09,156
Jesus.

790
00:48:10,124 --> 00:48:12,259
Hey, I was actually
just looking to make some...

791
00:48:12,292 --> 00:48:14,261
Shut your mouth and turn around.

792
00:48:14,294 --> 00:48:15,530
Hands where I can see 'em.

793
00:48:15,563 --> 00:48:16,598
Okay.

794
00:48:18,332 --> 00:48:20,200
NYPD. You're under arrest.

795
00:48:20,234 --> 00:48:22,035
Yeah, east wing,
we got a party crash...

796
00:48:34,081 --> 00:48:39,219
Rhodes, Mike, this place is
crowded with undercover cops.

797
00:48:40,287 --> 00:48:42,891
Ah, they're probably just
moonlighting as security, right?

798
00:48:43,892 --> 00:48:47,194
Here for the cash handout
and seafood buffet.

799
00:48:47,227 --> 00:48:48,462
Proceed as planned.

800
00:49:10,585 --> 00:49:12,720
Hey, gorgeous.
Fancy seeing you here.

801
00:49:12,754 --> 00:49:15,690
Can I help you? Oh, cut the
charade. Nobody can hear us.

802
00:49:15,723 --> 00:49:18,560
So how's the big mission going?
You ready to make the big swipe, huh?

803
00:49:18,593 --> 00:49:20,427
Okay, use your head.

804
00:49:20,461 --> 00:49:22,029
Someone could ID us later on.

805
00:49:22,062 --> 00:49:24,064
See, that's why
I like you, Sykes.

806
00:49:24,097 --> 00:49:26,233
You're as smart as you're hot.

807
00:49:26,266 --> 00:49:28,001
How about we find
a little corner somewhere

808
00:49:28,035 --> 00:49:30,370
and we can, uh, you know,
have a little talk?

809
00:49:30,404 --> 00:49:32,439
Okay, we're here
to steal that card.

810
00:49:32,473 --> 00:49:34,509
I know. And a little
action before the big action

811
00:49:34,542 --> 00:49:36,243
won't hurt nobody, right?

812
00:49:36,276 --> 00:49:40,214
Oh.
Oh, you were dead serious.

813
00:49:41,014 --> 00:49:43,050
What the fuck
did you just say to me?

814
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:45,219
Okay, real talk.

815
00:49:45,252 --> 00:49:49,089
You're a bourgie, rich asshole
acting like you have a wild side.

816
00:49:49,122 --> 00:49:52,392
You give Casey some jobs, so
you feel like you're part of a team,

817
00:49:52,426 --> 00:49:55,563
but I bet you were never
picked for any sports team.

818
00:49:55,597 --> 00:49:58,031
You're nothing more than
just another dick in a suit

819
00:49:58,065 --> 00:50:00,367
who's never had to work
a day in his life.

820
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,035
Now that we've cleared that up,

821
00:50:02,069 --> 00:50:04,271
let's keep it
fucking professional

822
00:50:04,304 --> 00:50:06,440
and stay the fuck
out of our way.

823
00:50:20,522 --> 00:50:22,590
Gerald May wood.

824
00:50:22,624 --> 00:50:25,392
You have a wife and two kids and live
at 506 Oakley Drive in Monterey Park.

825
00:50:25,425 --> 00:50:28,730
Now, do as I say, and the
guy parked outside your house

826
00:50:28,763 --> 00:50:31,533
won't turn into the guy
who goes inside your house.

827
00:50:33,233 --> 00:50:35,302
Now, wipe the cameras
for the last hour.

828
00:50:37,505 --> 00:50:38,673
There you go.

829
00:50:41,174 --> 00:50:42,309
Stand up

830
00:50:43,778 --> 00:50:45,445
and walk to that room.

831
00:50:45,479 --> 00:50:47,147
I'm gonna lock you in it.

832
00:50:52,754 --> 00:50:54,589
The centerpiece
item of the evening.

833
00:50:54,622 --> 00:50:56,824
A 1979 Wayne Gretzky rookie card

834
00:50:56,858 --> 00:50:58,726
from before his time
with the Oilers.

835
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,595
Bidding will start
at $1 million.

836
00:51:00,628 --> 00:51:01,829
Do I have one million?

837
00:51:01,863 --> 00:51:04,131
One million over there.
Do I have 1.1?

838
00:51:05,198 --> 00:51:07,669
1.1, anyone? 1.1.

839
00:51:07,702 --> 00:51:09,704
1.2? 1.2? 1.2.

840
00:51:09,737 --> 00:51:11,639
Do I have 1.5? 1.5.

841
00:51:11,673 --> 00:51:14,341
Do I have 1.8? 1.8? 1.8.

842
00:51:14,374 --> 00:51:17,444
Do I have two? Two million?
Two million. Two million.

843
00:51:17,477 --> 00:51:19,847
2.1?
Once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

844
00:51:19,881 --> 00:51:21,248
2.1?

845
00:51:21,281 --> 00:51:23,618
2.1.2.1?

846
00:51:24,251 --> 00:51:27,120
2.2? 2.2? 2.2.

847
00:51:27,154 --> 00:51:30,123
Going once, twice, sold.

848
00:51:30,157 --> 00:51:32,292
Well, that was exciting.

849
00:51:32,326 --> 00:51:33,795
Moving to position now.

850
00:51:33,828 --> 00:51:35,429
Okay.

851
00:51:35,462 --> 00:51:38,398
Three, two, one, go.

852
00:51:46,473 --> 00:51:47,809
Everyone, stay calm.

853
00:51:55,248 --> 00:51:56,551
Stop her.

854
00:52:01,221 --> 00:52:02,422
Oop. Shit.

855
00:52:03,156 --> 00:52:04,826
Hey. Hey, stop there.

856
00:52:08,896 --> 00:52:11,599
Get the card. No one can leave
until we search all of them.

857
00:52:11,633 --> 00:52:13,333
Lock down the building.

858
00:52:13,367 --> 00:52:15,469
What the fuck are you doing?

859
00:52:24,211 --> 00:52:26,213
Hey, Sykes, they're coming
down the stairwell.

860
00:52:31,385 --> 00:52:32,620
Ah, shit.

861
00:52:43,998 --> 00:52:46,801
The fuck, Sykes? We good?
We gotta go.

862
00:52:46,834 --> 00:52:48,368
Mike, can you hear her?

863
00:52:48,402 --> 00:52:50,437
<i>Not since she swiped the card.</i>

864
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:52,974
Sykes? Fuck.

865
00:52:53,007 --> 00:52:54,942
<i>So much for getting out
in 30 seconds.</i>

866
00:52:59,379 --> 00:53:01,248
Shit.

867
00:53:01,816 --> 00:53:02,950
Shit.

868
00:53:05,419 --> 00:53:07,722
Uh, hello.
This is your captain speaking.

869
00:53:07,755 --> 00:53:11,793
<i>I have a very special message
for a very important person.</i>

870
00:53:11,826 --> 00:53:14,494
<i>"Left, right, right, left."</i>

871
00:53:16,531 --> 00:53:18,933
<i>Got my toy in the
truck if we need it, Case.</i>

872
00:53:18,966 --> 00:53:20,935
<i>No fucking way.
She's got this.</i>

873
00:53:22,804 --> 00:53:25,272
Come on. Shit.
Come on, Sykes. Come on.

874
00:53:27,642 --> 00:53:30,310
<i>Case, we gotta leave now.</i>

875
00:53:46,861 --> 00:53:48,428
There she is.

876
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,736
- Freeze.
- Hands up.

877
00:54:26,701 --> 00:54:28,335
Come on. Move.

878
00:54:28,368 --> 00:54:29,537
We gotta go!
Come on!

879
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:30,705
Let's go!
Yo, where's Sykes?

880
00:54:30,738 --> 00:54:31,873
Come on.

881
00:54:33,608 --> 00:54:35,710
Let's go! Come on!

882
00:54:35,743 --> 00:54:38,079
Let's go, buddy.

883
00:54:38,112 --> 00:54:40,782
We have to get out, for
fuck's sake.

884
00:54:43,818 --> 00:54:45,385
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

885
00:54:45,418 --> 00:54:47,688
We needed Mercer.
Rather him than fucking Sykes!

886
00:55:01,269 --> 00:55:04,071
Case, we have to
go back for her.

887
00:55:04,105 --> 00:55:06,908
It's gonna be okay.
Just stick to the plan.

888
00:55:10,678 --> 00:55:12,079
Here you go.

889
00:55:12,647 --> 00:55:14,515
Come on, come on, come on.

890
00:55:37,404 --> 00:55:38,706
They wiped the counters.

891
00:55:38,739 --> 00:55:40,407
There's fingerprints everywhere.

892
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,475
This is open and shut.

893
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:46,446
Yo, check it. We got fucking Dave
Chapelle and Patrick Stewart over here.

894
00:55:46,479 --> 00:55:49,784
I can't believe the
captain's letting them tag along.

895
00:55:49,817 --> 00:55:52,887
Watch your back. Yep.
There you go.

896
00:55:54,522 --> 00:55:55,857
What was stolen?

897
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:59,794
Uh, some one-of-a-kind
sport card.

898
00:55:59,827 --> 00:56:01,494
Some shit like that.

899
00:56:01,529 --> 00:56:03,030
Sold at 2.2 million.

900
00:56:03,064 --> 00:56:05,666
The woman we picked up
didn't say a word.

901
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,935
She didn't have it with her.

902
00:56:07,969 --> 00:56:10,004
It must still be in here.

903
00:56:10,037 --> 00:56:11,539
Officers.

904
00:56:12,974 --> 00:56:14,441
Hey.

905
00:56:14,976 --> 00:56:16,777
I remember you.

906
00:56:16,811 --> 00:56:20,548
- Some night, huh?
- Yeah, walk the scene.

907
00:56:21,682 --> 00:56:23,150
Yeah, see what you see.

908
00:56:26,187 --> 00:56:27,555
I love that guy.

909
00:56:28,089 --> 00:56:29,757
If you're involved,

910
00:56:30,258 --> 00:56:31,893
I won't cover for you.

911
00:56:35,596 --> 00:56:37,565
I was just here
for the auction, sir.

912
00:56:37,598 --> 00:56:38,833
Shut up.

913
00:56:40,501 --> 00:56:42,069
Nice badge.

914
00:56:42,937 --> 00:56:44,005
Thanks.

915
00:56:45,472 --> 00:56:48,910
However, my escort tonight
has already left,

916
00:56:48,943 --> 00:56:51,712
so, uh,
I'm gonna need a new one.

917
00:56:52,613 --> 00:56:53,881
That's where you come in.

918
00:56:53,915 --> 00:56:55,549
So why don't you walk me out?

919
00:56:57,852 --> 00:56:58,953
No.

920
00:57:00,054 --> 00:57:01,956
No?
No.

921
00:57:01,989 --> 00:57:04,926
You ain't the only friend
I got in the department.

922
00:57:04,959 --> 00:57:07,628
So, tell you what.
You do this for me, and, uh...

923
00:57:07,662 --> 00:57:08,696
Fuck off.

924
00:57:08,729 --> 00:57:11,032
Oh, "fuck off."

925
00:57:11,065 --> 00:57:12,566
Yeah.
That's a no too, right?

926
00:57:14,268 --> 00:57:16,037
Walk me through that line,
Detective.

927
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:18,072
I said no.
No.

928
00:57:18,105 --> 00:57:20,207
You don't get to say no.

929
00:57:20,241 --> 00:57:22,576
You seem to have forgotten
a phone call we had earlier,

930
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:23,911
so let me remind you.

931
00:57:24,946 --> 00:57:27,949
<i>Fitz, God bless him, is alive,</i>

932
00:57:27,982 --> 00:57:29,884
<i>but only as long as I allow.</i>

933
00:57:31,085 --> 00:57:33,220
<i>You shouldn't have come back,
Detective.</i>

934
00:57:33,254 --> 00:57:36,123
<i>But since you're here,
I'm calling in that favor.</i>

935
00:57:42,897 --> 00:57:44,632
Now walk.

936
00:57:47,835 --> 00:57:49,637
Let's go.

937
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:53,708
He's clear.

938
00:57:55,109 --> 00:57:56,744
After you.

939
00:58:12,693 --> 00:58:14,028
What the hell
just happened here?

940
00:58:14,061 --> 00:58:15,529
Did you search him?

941
00:58:15,563 --> 00:58:17,665
S-So you just let him go?
Just like that?

942
00:58:17,698 --> 00:58:19,000
You know what?

943
00:58:19,867 --> 00:58:21,802
Something is going on there.

944
00:58:21,836 --> 00:58:23,971
- He's got something on you.
- On me?

945
00:58:24,005 --> 00:58:26,607
You're a fucking disgrace now.
You don't deserve this badge.

946
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,209
I'm going to report you.

947
00:58:51,632 --> 00:58:52,800
You're fine.

948
00:58:58,105 --> 00:59:00,741
Fuck, man.
We gotta go back and get her.

949
00:59:01,742 --> 00:59:03,344
I'm gonna call Winna.
Okay?

950
00:59:03,377 --> 00:59:05,312
He's got cops in his pockets.
He'll know what to do.

951
00:59:05,346 --> 00:59:07,815
Winna only cares about himself.
He doesn't give a fuck about us.

952
00:59:07,848 --> 00:59:10,951
Exactly. What's good for
us is good for everybody.

953
00:59:10,985 --> 00:59:14,789
Sykes isn't gonna give us up.
Hey, you know that. Right?

954
00:59:14,822 --> 00:59:17,792
It's in everybody's best
interest to get her free.

955
00:59:17,825 --> 00:59:21,228
Now, flip the plates, burn everything,
stick to the fucking plan, baby.

956
00:59:21,262 --> 00:59:22,863
Let's go. You got it.

957
00:59:28,302 --> 00:59:31,038
<i>Hey, Casey,
my friend. How you doing?</i>

958
00:59:31,072 --> 00:59:33,174
Hey, before you say anything,
no, okay?

959
00:59:33,207 --> 00:59:34,742
Sykes isn't gonna give us up.

960
00:59:34,775 --> 00:59:36,844
<i>Are you sure about that?</i>

961
00:59:36,877 --> 00:59:38,345
The fuck is that
supposed to mean?

962
00:59:38,379 --> 00:59:40,781
<i>It means I got people
in the system.</i> Yeah.

963
00:59:40,815 --> 00:59:43,918
<i>Don't ask. If you think she's
gonna be a problem, just say so.</i>

964
00:59:43,951 --> 00:59:45,352
<i>I can make it so she ain't.</i>

965
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,856
No, no, okay?
She's part of the team.

966
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:50,758
<i>Look, okay, I get it.
You're right. Fine.</i>

967
00:59:50,791 --> 00:59:52,359
<i>Just forget anything I said,
all right?</i>

968
00:59:52,393 --> 00:59:55,729
<i>Listen, good news,
we got the card.</i>

969
00:59:55,763 --> 00:59:58,732
<i>But bad news is, well,
Sykes handed it off to me,</i>

970
00:59:58,766 --> 01:00:00,801
<i>which was smart in the moment.</i>

971
01:00:00,835 --> 01:00:03,637
<i>But to get out myself, I kind
of had to pass it off to a cop.</i>

972
01:00:03,671 --> 01:00:05,840
<i>And now, I have no idea
where this cop is.</i>

973
01:00:05,873 --> 01:00:08,843
<i>But don't worry about that.
All is well. All will be well.</i>

974
01:00:08,876 --> 01:00:11,312
<i>We'll just track him down
and we'll get the card.</i>

975
01:00:11,345 --> 01:00:13,013
Hello?

976
01:00:13,047 --> 01:00:15,082
<i>We are going
to be rich, my friend.</i>

977
01:00:15,116 --> 01:00:18,419
<i>I told you, I got your back.
You have nothing to worry about.</i>

978
01:00:18,452 --> 01:00:21,856
<i>Life is good. We're on top of
the world. I will speak to you soon.</i>

979
01:00:22,356 --> 01:00:23,390
Hello?

980
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,329
All right. Sounds good.

981
01:00:31,132 --> 01:00:32,166
Ho!

982
01:00:34,401 --> 01:00:35,636
Hey, Mike!

983
01:00:41,842 --> 01:00:42,910
Whoo!

984
01:00:45,746 --> 01:00:47,448
Yo, Mike.

985
01:00:47,481 --> 01:00:48,716
What the fuck is that?

986
01:00:52,486 --> 01:00:53,888
Case!

987
01:00:54,955 --> 01:00:55,890
Fuck!

988
01:01:17,077 --> 01:01:18,078
Fuck.

989
01:01:34,295 --> 01:01:35,763
Uh-uh.

990
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,294
Die!

991
01:02:34,455 --> 01:02:38,092
Okay, you're out of ammo.
This should be some fun.

992
01:02:44,599 --> 01:02:45,966
Hey, Mike!

993
01:02:47,234 --> 01:02:49,370
Mike!

994
01:02:52,973 --> 01:02:54,241
You all right, buddy?

995
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:59,346
You fucking piece of shit.

996
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:04,151
Yo, I know this guy.

997
01:03:06,854 --> 01:03:08,355
He's security for Winna.

998
01:03:10,157 --> 01:03:11,225
Yo, Mikey?

999
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:17,364
You okay?

1000
01:03:18,165 --> 01:03:20,100
I'll get you to the hospital,
all right?

1001
01:03:20,134 --> 01:03:21,368
Okay, Mikey, look.

1002
01:03:22,637 --> 01:03:24,004
Hey, Mikey.

1003
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:26,373
Hey, Mike! Mike!

1004
01:03:27,107 --> 01:03:29,009
Hey, buddy, you're okay.
You're okay.

1005
01:03:29,043 --> 01:03:32,079
Hey, look at me. Look at me.
You're all right, buddy.

1006
01:03:32,112 --> 01:03:35,583
We're gonna get you to the
hospital. You're gonna be all right.

1007
01:03:35,617 --> 01:03:37,084
Hey, Mikey.

1008
01:03:37,619 --> 01:03:40,220
Oh, fuck. Mike!

1009
01:04:34,041 --> 01:04:35,309
<i>You think you're here?</i>

1010
01:04:46,353 --> 01:04:48,322
Come on, pick up. Pick up.

1011
01:04:49,657 --> 01:04:50,692
Hi.

1012
01:04:50,725 --> 01:04:53,360
Hey, baby.
<i>Hi. Hi.</i>

1013
01:04:53,394 --> 01:04:56,631
Lily, I need you to leave the
house, get Clara and get to a hotel.

1014
01:04:56,664 --> 01:04:58,566
<i>What? What is... What...</i>

1015
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,968
<i>Casey, what are you talking about?</i>
Something fucked-up happened.

1016
01:05:01,001 --> 01:05:03,170
<i>What did you do?</i>
No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

1017
01:05:03,203 --> 01:05:05,339
Hey, I need you to leave
the house right now, okay?

1018
01:05:05,372 --> 01:05:07,474
<i>What did you do, Casey?</i>
I don't have time to explain.

1019
01:05:07,509 --> 01:05:09,376
Just leave the house.
<i>Jesus! I can't believe it.</i>

1020
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:11,311
<i>Did you hurt someone?</i>
No, it's not that.

1021
01:05:11,345 --> 01:05:14,682
Leave the house, Lily! Go!

1022
01:05:15,683 --> 01:05:17,050
Hell...

1023
01:05:19,453 --> 01:05:20,588
God!

1024
01:05:21,321 --> 01:05:23,390
Fuck. Fuck.

1025
01:05:31,064 --> 01:05:32,634
Mercer.

1026
01:05:32,667 --> 01:05:36,203
It's Rhodes. I need to meet.

1027
01:05:41,509 --> 01:05:42,943
We need to talk.

1028
01:05:54,789 --> 01:05:57,991
So, from the top.
Is Knight dirty?

1029
01:05:58,025 --> 01:06:00,194
I don't know. Maybe.

1030
01:06:00,227 --> 01:06:03,230
We think Winna's involved
in these heists?

1031
01:06:03,263 --> 01:06:05,600
Well, it's not a coincidence
that he was there.

1032
01:06:08,101 --> 01:06:10,505
How many cases has Knight
tanked for Winna?

1033
01:06:13,073 --> 01:06:14,676
Honestly, none.

1034
01:06:16,477 --> 01:06:18,580
I think it was just a case of

1035
01:06:18,613 --> 01:06:20,782
"Looking the other way"
situation, you know?

1036
01:06:20,815 --> 01:06:24,719
But Knight doesn't let
anything slide, ever.

1037
01:06:24,752 --> 01:06:26,487
He's too proud.

1038
01:06:31,291 --> 01:06:32,326
Fitzgerald.

1039
01:06:32,794 --> 01:06:34,027
Who?

1040
01:06:35,496 --> 01:06:38,633
His partner. The one
who got shot by Rhodes.

1041
01:06:39,667 --> 01:06:42,604
Bet you Winna
threatened his life.

1042
01:06:42,637 --> 01:06:44,304
That explains it.

1043
01:06:44,338 --> 01:06:46,641
A bad guy said
he'd hurt his friend?

1044
01:06:46,674 --> 01:06:48,543
He is a cop.

1045
01:06:48,576 --> 01:06:51,278
He knows better than to let a
perp leave the scene of a heist.

1046
01:06:51,311 --> 01:06:53,213
And not just any perp.

1047
01:06:53,247 --> 01:06:57,417
All have open cases on Winna.

1048
01:06:57,451 --> 01:06:59,721
He's a slimy, rich
asshole bastard.

1049
01:06:59,754 --> 01:07:03,056
He's been sliding out of each and every
investigation, throwing his money around.

1050
01:07:03,090 --> 01:07:05,560
He is the cause of
what's wrong with this city.

1051
01:07:05,593 --> 01:07:09,631
He even used to be a CI and
played the force to eliminate his rivals.

1052
01:07:09,664 --> 01:07:11,365
You think we don't know
about Winna?

1053
01:07:11,398 --> 01:07:13,066
We have been on his ass
for years!

1054
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:15,469
And two city cops from LA
walk in here

1055
01:07:15,503 --> 01:07:17,237
and think they're
gonna handle this shit,

1056
01:07:17,271 --> 01:07:19,239
fuckin' up
the whole entire case?

1057
01:07:20,508 --> 01:07:22,577
The woman, she said something?

1058
01:07:23,711 --> 01:07:25,680
Not a word.
Listen.

1059
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:30,083
I can get her to speak.
Give me five minutes.

1060
01:07:30,117 --> 01:07:32,820
Be lucky you are not
in the cell next to her.

1061
01:07:32,854 --> 01:07:36,390
Knight goes anywhere
near this case or Winna,

1062
01:07:36,423 --> 01:07:38,292
I will have him
in a cell so long

1063
01:07:38,325 --> 01:07:40,160
it will rot
his fucking head off.

1064
01:07:42,564 --> 01:07:43,698
Get out of my office.

1065
01:08:09,524 --> 01:08:12,359
<i>You're a fucking disgrace
now. You don't deserve this badge.</i>

1066
01:08:13,828 --> 01:08:17,431
<i>Something is going on there.
He's got something on you.</i>

1067
01:09:53,995 --> 01:09:56,631
<i>Hey, it's your favorite CI
Winna.</i>

1068
01:09:56,664 --> 01:09:59,433
<i>Just letting you know, Leach
will be coming by any second.</i>

1069
01:09:59,466 --> 01:10:02,637
<i>And, uh, don't forget,
Detective, you owe me.</i>

1070
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,836
<i>How's my favorite detective?</i>

1071
01:10:34,869 --> 01:10:36,671
Yeah, what's it to you?

1072
01:10:36,704 --> 01:10:39,439
Oh, let's meet.

1073
01:10:39,473 --> 01:10:41,542
I think we should meet.

1074
01:11:34,061 --> 01:11:35,563
- Hey, baby.
<i>- Hi, Casey.</i>

1075
01:11:35,596 --> 01:11:36,898
You guys at the hotel?

1076
01:11:37,632 --> 01:11:39,734
<i>Uh, no.</i>

1077
01:11:39,767 --> 01:11:41,836
What do you mean?
<i>We're not at the hotel.</i>

1078
01:11:41,869 --> 01:11:44,939
No, no, no, no. Hey, no. No. I
need you... I need you to trust me.

1079
01:11:44,972 --> 01:11:46,941
<i>This is insane.</i>
Baby, I need you to trust me.

1080
01:11:46,974 --> 01:11:49,977
I need you to get your shit, get
Clara and get to a hotel right now.

1081
01:11:50,011 --> 01:11:51,913
<i>No, I don't want to do that.</i>
No!

1082
01:11:51,946 --> 01:11:54,015
<i>You're being paranoid.</i>
No, I'm not. I promise you.

1083
01:11:54,048 --> 01:11:56,449
<i>You are being paranoid.</i>
I'm not being paranoid, okay?

1084
01:11:56,483 --> 01:11:58,853
People are after me. You're
not safe.

1085
01:11:58,886 --> 01:12:02,123
You're not safe. <i>Well, I feel safe.
And I don't... I'm over this. I'm done.</i>

1086
01:12:02,156 --> 01:12:03,891
You... Fuck.

1087
01:12:11,732 --> 01:12:13,000
Oh, fuck.

1088
01:12:17,972 --> 01:12:19,607
Oh, fuck.

1089
01:12:27,081 --> 01:12:28,616
Ah, fuck.

1090
01:12:28,649 --> 01:12:31,018
Fuck.

1091
01:12:37,859 --> 01:12:39,894
They shot Mike.

1092
01:12:39,927 --> 01:12:43,430
And Sykes is locked up somewhere,
man. It's absolutely fucked.

1093
01:12:44,464 --> 01:12:46,567
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

1094
01:12:47,467 --> 01:12:48,502
Hmm?

1095
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:51,404
Can you try to have a heart?

1096
01:12:51,438 --> 01:12:52,974
I'm here, aren't I?

1097
01:12:53,007 --> 01:12:54,942
I mean, there,
that's some good news.

1098
01:12:56,043 --> 01:12:58,980
Man, you've always had a
fucked-up definition of good.

1099
01:13:02,449 --> 01:13:04,719
Man, if you're feeling
the heat, get...

1100
01:13:04,752 --> 01:13:06,187
You know, go to Mexico
or something.

1101
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:08,189
Mexico, and then what?

1102
01:13:08,222 --> 01:13:09,790
Well, live.

1103
01:13:09,824 --> 01:13:11,959
Be free.
Not go to fucking jail.

1104
01:13:12,693 --> 01:13:15,162
Winna tried to wipe me out, man.

1105
01:13:20,201 --> 01:13:21,602
You have anything on you?

1106
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:24,505
Jesus, man.

1107
01:13:25,606 --> 01:13:27,808
Just slow down, buddy.

1108
01:13:38,485 --> 01:13:40,453
Do you feel better?

1109
01:13:40,487 --> 01:13:41,522
Okay.

1110
01:13:42,723 --> 01:13:44,892
All right, so what's the play?

1111
01:13:47,929 --> 01:13:50,932
Well, Winna's not gonna stop
until I'm dead.

1112
01:13:51,966 --> 01:13:53,901
Probably.

1113
01:13:53,935 --> 01:13:56,469
So I gotta figure out a way
to get close to him.

1114
01:13:57,638 --> 01:13:58,906
And then what?

1115
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:00,541
The fuck you think?

1116
01:14:01,409 --> 01:14:04,078
No, come on, bro.
You're not a fucking killer.

1117
01:14:04,111 --> 01:14:07,014
You've been a grumpy little
bitch ever since you shot that cop.

1118
01:14:07,048 --> 01:14:08,215
Man, fuck you.

1119
01:14:10,551 --> 01:14:12,954
Man, you're talking
about premeditated murder.

1120
01:14:13,754 --> 01:14:17,124
Not this fluffy little
self-defense shit.

1121
01:14:17,158 --> 01:14:20,227
You got to walk up to him,
put a gun to his fucking head

1122
01:14:20,261 --> 01:14:21,796
and pull the trigger.

1123
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:25,099
Come on, Casey,
you're not that guy.

1124
01:14:31,072 --> 01:14:32,974
I know how we can get
close to him.

1125
01:14:35,710 --> 01:14:38,212
The card is
in a cop's desk, right?

1126
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:41,082
So, we sneak into...

1127
01:14:43,184 --> 01:14:44,819
Sneak...

1128
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:48,556
We just gotta sneak
into a police station.

1129
01:14:50,057 --> 01:14:51,192
Fuck, right.

1130
01:14:53,094 --> 01:14:54,929
No, no, no, no, no.

1131
01:14:55,563 --> 01:14:56,964
One of us can.

1132
01:14:56,998 --> 01:15:00,067
One of us can. Okay?

1133
01:15:00,101 --> 01:15:02,603
Just like a fucking
football play, brother.

1134
01:15:02,636 --> 01:15:04,605
I fucking fake left,
you go right.

1135
01:15:06,874 --> 01:15:11,078
You say I do,
I'll fucking do it.

1136
01:15:11,112 --> 01:15:14,815
Dude, I can't let you... I can't ask
you to do that. I mean, come on.

1137
01:15:14,849 --> 01:15:17,084
I'll create a diversion,
get the cops to follow me.

1138
01:15:17,118 --> 01:15:19,620
All you gotta do is find
a way to get in there.

1139
01:15:19,653 --> 01:15:21,622
And guess what, baby?
It's fucking Halloween.

1140
01:15:23,124 --> 01:15:24,725
It is Halloween.

1141
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:28,562
One time a year you can wear
a mask anywhere you want.

1142
01:15:30,197 --> 01:15:31,265
No...

1143
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,535
Get creative.

1144
01:15:36,103 --> 01:15:37,938
It'd be fun.

1145
01:16:29,323 --> 01:16:30,891
Hey!

1146
01:16:32,359 --> 01:16:33,594
What's up?

1147
01:16:34,028 --> 01:16:35,229
Jesus Christ.

1148
01:16:36,197 --> 01:16:39,133
How are those Scots-Irish
genes treating you now?

1149
01:16:40,868 --> 01:16:44,038
Worse than the English.
Yeah.

1150
01:16:44,071 --> 01:16:46,073
You woke me up.

1151
01:16:48,342 --> 01:16:50,211
All right, come on, pal.

1152
01:16:52,413 --> 01:16:54,615
It's still raining, isn't it?

1153
01:17:00,754 --> 01:17:04,158
I'm losing my mind
trying to figure this out.

1154
01:17:04,959 --> 01:17:06,060
Nikki Sykes.

1155
01:17:06,794 --> 01:17:08,262
Ex-Olympic gymnast.

1156
01:17:09,063 --> 01:17:11,031
Finished fourth at Rio.

1157
01:17:11,065 --> 01:17:14,201
And then she got banned
for life from the sport.

1158
01:17:14,235 --> 01:17:15,669
For coming in fourth?

1159
01:17:15,703 --> 01:17:17,238
No.

1160
01:17:17,271 --> 01:17:20,207
For selling medical records
of her fellow Olympians.

1161
01:17:20,241 --> 01:17:22,209
They couldn't prove it.

1162
01:17:22,243 --> 01:17:25,279
Apparently, the buyer is a
guy who allegedly worked for...

1163
01:17:25,312 --> 01:17:26,847
Let me guess.

1164
01:17:27,882 --> 01:17:29,350
Winna.

1165
01:17:29,383 --> 01:17:31,252
That's right.
Mm-hmm.

1166
01:17:31,285 --> 01:17:33,988
Sykes hasn't said a word.

1167
01:17:34,021 --> 01:17:37,992
But these days, the metadata
on phones do all the talking.

1168
01:17:38,025 --> 01:17:44,131
So I got a buddy of mine at NSA,
you know, to QTap her phone.

1169
01:17:44,165 --> 01:17:46,066
Just to see what kind
of cluster of friends

1170
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:48,669
she's chatting with
consistently.

1171
01:17:49,170 --> 01:17:50,337
Who else?

1172
01:17:50,371 --> 01:17:52,239
Mike Rochester.

1173
01:17:52,273 --> 01:17:55,009
Went to the same college as
Rhodes and got drafted by the Mets.

1174
01:17:55,042 --> 01:17:56,343
Mm-hmm.

1175
01:17:56,377 --> 01:17:58,145
And then only played
for one year, because...

1176
01:17:58,179 --> 01:18:01,282
Mm-hmm... he was partying
too much. They cut him.

1177
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:04,818
Well, he's dead now.

1178
01:18:04,852 --> 01:18:09,456
They found his body in
his uncle's junkyard. Oh.

1179
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:12,860
I guess Rhodes wanted
one less share to go around.

1180
01:18:12,893 --> 01:18:14,228
Yeah, that doesn't track.

1181
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:22,169
They're not gonna
leave anybody behind.

1182
01:18:23,804 --> 01:18:25,072
What if it was Winna?

1183
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:27,841
He knows heat is coming his way,

1184
01:18:27,875 --> 01:18:31,178
so he tried to merc them,
but screws the hit.

1185
01:18:33,314 --> 01:18:37,384
He-He knows that Mercer
and Rhodes won't go quietly.

1186
01:18:38,819 --> 01:18:40,788
Odds are pretty good.

1187
01:18:40,821 --> 01:18:43,390
I mean, they'll choose death
before they go to prison.

1188
01:18:43,424 --> 01:18:46,160
Mm-hmm. I think it's a
bet that Winna will take.

1189
01:18:46,827 --> 01:18:49,964
Has the card turned up?
No.

1190
01:18:49,997 --> 01:18:51,533
What about the DA?

1191
01:18:51,566 --> 01:18:54,201
Can you tie them
to the robberies?

1192
01:18:54,235 --> 01:18:56,136
The security guard
from the arena,

1193
01:18:56,170 --> 01:18:58,339
he thinks he can ID
Rhode's voice.

1194
01:18:58,372 --> 01:19:00,007
Circumstantial.

1195
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:01,543
Nah, come on, man.

1196
01:19:01,576 --> 01:19:03,143
No witnesses.

1197
01:19:03,177 --> 01:19:05,846
Come on. Everyone
can see that it's them.

1198
01:19:05,879 --> 01:19:07,481
Rhodes executed both jobs

1199
01:19:07,515 --> 01:19:12,453
like it was straight
out of Belichick's playbook.

1200
01:19:12,486 --> 01:19:14,188
Why don't you call Bill up?

1201
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:17,024
Maybe he's moonlighting.

1202
01:19:17,057 --> 01:19:19,059
Come on, don't be pithy.

1203
01:19:19,093 --> 01:19:21,195
You don't have
a shred of evidence.

1204
01:19:21,228 --> 01:19:24,832
These guys made a living
fighting over a pigskin.

1205
01:19:24,865 --> 01:19:26,233
I mean, it's not a big stretch

1206
01:19:26,267 --> 01:19:28,302
from being an ex-football
player... Mm-hmm.

1207
01:19:28,335 --> 01:19:31,105
...to becoming a bank robber.
Mm-hmm.

1208
01:19:32,339 --> 01:19:33,974
This was fun.

1209
01:19:34,008 --> 01:19:36,377
That's it?

1210
01:19:39,614 --> 01:19:43,183
You know, I was thinking.

1211
01:19:45,286 --> 01:19:47,054
What if we try your way?

1212
01:19:47,087 --> 01:19:49,390
You know, like,
we go old school on them.

1213
01:19:49,423 --> 01:19:52,359
Just try to shake a few cages
and see what falls out.

1214
01:19:53,227 --> 01:19:54,461
Are you wearing a wire?

1215
01:19:54,495 --> 01:19:56,363
Come on, you must be kidding.

1216
01:19:56,397 --> 01:19:58,365
Do you have something
on you now?

1217
01:19:58,399 --> 01:20:03,137
I just want to close this book on
these fuckers and just go back home.

1218
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:04,204
I hate New York.

1219
01:20:05,072 --> 01:20:06,307
No, I don't.

1220
01:20:07,308 --> 01:20:09,310
Well, I do.

1221
01:20:12,547 --> 01:20:15,583
They can get to Fitz anytime.

1222
01:20:15,617 --> 01:20:17,418
I can't run that risk.

1223
01:20:19,453 --> 01:20:21,455
If Fitz was in your shoes,

1224
01:20:21,488 --> 01:20:26,026
wouldn't you want him doing
everything in his power to stop Winna?

1225
01:21:12,072 --> 01:21:13,907
Oh, no!
No, no, no!

1226
01:21:13,941 --> 01:21:17,211
All right, everybody
stay on the fucking ground.

1227
01:21:17,244 --> 01:21:20,280
We're gonna make this
real quick. It's a bank robbery.

1228
01:21:20,314 --> 01:21:23,484
As you probably know,
load this fucking bag right now!

1229
01:21:23,518 --> 01:21:25,486
You! All against
the fucking wall.

1230
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:28,590
Pull out your phones
and dial 911!

1231
01:21:28,623 --> 01:21:32,527
Okay. Now you call and say
to the New York police,

1232
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:35,663
"Hello, we are being robbed
by the big, bad wolf.

1233
01:21:35,697 --> 01:21:38,098
And we're scared,
scared little piggies!"

1234
01:21:38,132 --> 01:21:41,368
You're gonna dial it!
Dial 911!

1235
01:21:41,402 --> 01:21:43,103
Thank you.

1236
01:21:43,137 --> 01:21:48,208
Send everybody who can,
every fucking piggy in the NYPD,

1237
01:21:48,242 --> 01:21:50,110
you send my fucking way.

1238
01:21:52,614 --> 01:21:54,281
211 in progress.

1239
01:22:00,588 --> 01:22:02,289
<i>What don't we try your way?</i>

1240
01:22:02,322 --> 01:22:06,493
<i>He knows that Mercer
and Rhodes won't go quietly.</i>

1241
01:22:06,528 --> 01:22:07,562
Nice badge.

1242
01:22:08,763 --> 01:22:10,565
<i>I think we should meet.</i>

1243
01:22:12,534 --> 01:22:16,704
And thank you very much.
You're very fast. Very efficient!

1244
01:22:16,738 --> 01:22:20,642
Okay, thank you very much!
Happy Halloween!

1245
01:22:20,675 --> 01:22:23,110
And have a wonderful,
wonderful day.

1246
01:22:23,143 --> 01:22:25,179
Don't stay up too late, piggies.

1247
01:22:27,615 --> 01:22:29,283
There he is!

1248
01:22:42,162 --> 01:22:44,064
Hold back, hold back.

1249
01:22:44,097 --> 01:22:45,567
Pull back! Pull back!

1250
01:23:10,057 --> 01:23:11,425
We have you surrounded.

1251
01:23:11,458 --> 01:23:14,161
Drop your weapon.
Come out with your hands up.

1252
01:23:26,406 --> 01:23:28,308
Shit! Stay down, stay down!

1253
01:23:58,372 --> 01:24:00,274
Where's your partner?

1254
01:24:00,307 --> 01:24:02,442
Shoot me.

1255
01:24:02,476 --> 01:24:04,646
- Where is Rhodes?
- Shoot me.

1256
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:08,415
Do it. Do it!

1257
01:24:09,884 --> 01:24:11,218
You pussy.

1258
01:24:24,866 --> 01:24:27,467
To all units,

1259
01:24:27,502 --> 01:24:30,470
be on the lookout
for one Casey Rhodes.

1260
01:24:30,505 --> 01:24:33,307
Male, Caucasian, in his 30s.

1261
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:35,610
He's armed and dangerous.

1262
01:25:19,252 --> 01:25:21,556
Hi, I'm here
to pick up the, uh...

1263
01:25:21,589 --> 01:25:23,457
Whatever. Go on in.

1264
01:25:57,792 --> 01:26:00,260
I can't see in this thing.

1265
01:26:08,002 --> 01:26:09,469
Good to see you.

1266
01:26:09,504 --> 01:26:11,271
You looking for something?
Ah, fuck!

1267
01:26:43,705 --> 01:26:45,773
Hop in. Are you, uh,
trying to be funny?

1268
01:26:45,807 --> 01:26:47,742
No, not at all.

1269
01:27:16,504 --> 01:27:17,839
Where are we going?

1270
01:27:21,374 --> 01:27:23,911
Where are we going?

1271
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:33,353
What, are you gonna drive me
somewhere and shoot me in the head?

1272
01:27:33,386 --> 01:27:35,957
What kind of cop are y...

1273
01:27:40,528 --> 01:27:42,429
Oh, fuck!

1274
01:27:45,967 --> 01:27:49,302
Uh...

1275
01:27:51,438 --> 01:27:53,808
They treat you like royalty.

1276
01:27:55,009 --> 01:27:57,578
Did you know that, Knight?

1277
01:27:57,612 --> 01:27:59,814
You know that.
You get the money, the fame.

1278
01:27:59,847 --> 01:28:01,414
The women.

1279
01:28:01,448 --> 01:28:03,551
And then the moment
you think you deserve it...

1280
01:28:04,786 --> 01:28:06,053
...boom, they take it away.

1281
01:28:06,087 --> 01:28:07,855
And all those people
you thought loved you,

1282
01:28:07,889 --> 01:28:09,690
they disappear too,

1283
01:28:09,724 --> 01:28:12,760
until all you're left with
is migraines and a fucked knee!

1284
01:28:17,565 --> 01:28:20,535
And a confused family
who just wants the old you back.

1285
01:28:23,571 --> 01:28:25,540
I just want it to end.

1286
01:28:29,877 --> 01:28:31,712
I mean, you get it, don't you?

1287
01:28:35,683 --> 01:28:38,519
You're always trying
to be normal.

1288
01:28:39,153 --> 01:28:40,621
But you're not normal.

1289
01:28:40,655 --> 01:28:42,355
You don't even know
what normal is,

1290
01:28:42,389 --> 01:28:44,792
so you... you do
what they trained you to do.

1291
01:28:44,826 --> 01:28:47,094
You... You... You keep moving.

1292
01:28:47,128 --> 01:28:49,130
<i>You go faster. You jump higher.</i>

1293
01:28:49,163 --> 01:28:50,898
<i>You hit harder.</i>

1294
01:28:50,932 --> 01:28:52,767
Always chasing.

1295
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,101
Winna knew that!

1296
01:28:56,737 --> 01:28:58,973
Are you even listening to me?

1297
01:28:59,006 --> 01:29:00,808
Are you listening to me?

1298
01:29:03,678 --> 01:29:05,713
They threatened my family.

1299
01:29:08,950 --> 01:29:11,118
Winna's gonna send Brigga
after them.

1300
01:29:11,986 --> 01:29:15,656
And I know... I know if I...
If I have this card,

1301
01:29:15,690 --> 01:29:16,991
I can get close to him.

1302
01:29:17,024 --> 01:29:18,860
And if I can get close to him,

1303
01:29:18,893 --> 01:29:22,395
I... I can make sure that he
never hurts anybody ever again.

1304
01:29:26,499 --> 01:29:29,904
I don't want my daughter
to grow up without her father.

1305
01:29:32,573 --> 01:29:33,674
I mean, she's...

1306
01:29:33,708 --> 01:29:35,743
She's my... She's my world.

1307
01:29:37,444 --> 01:29:39,080
And I did all of this for her.

1308
01:29:44,451 --> 01:29:46,486
I mean,
that's not completely true.

1309
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:48,522
I mean,
I did a lot of it for me.

1310
01:29:48,556 --> 01:29:50,490
I did a lot of it for me, man.

1311
01:29:51,158 --> 01:29:52,492
I just...

1312
01:29:53,527 --> 01:29:55,162
Fuck.

1313
01:29:55,196 --> 01:29:56,964
You fucking idiot.

1314
01:30:02,503 --> 01:30:04,605
Yeah,
it fucking serves me right.

1315
01:30:30,631 --> 01:30:33,935
Oh, God. Damn it. Fuck.

1316
01:30:39,507 --> 01:30:40,741
Winna.

1317
01:30:42,643 --> 01:30:44,745
You know Winna's got guards
everywhere, right?

1318
01:30:44,779 --> 01:30:45,980
So?

1319
01:30:47,882 --> 01:30:51,619
All right, give me a gun.

1320
01:30:53,187 --> 01:30:54,956
Give me a fucking gun.

1321
01:30:56,791 --> 01:30:58,491
Please?

1322
01:31:15,309 --> 01:31:16,544
Ah!

1323
01:31:29,690 --> 01:31:30,958
Knight is here.

1324
01:31:45,039 --> 01:31:47,908
You were right. We
should have gotten more guards.

1325
01:31:56,617 --> 01:32:00,087
Goddamn. Rhodes too?

1326
01:32:00,121 --> 01:32:02,123
That means the cops
aren't far behind.

1327
01:32:04,125 --> 01:32:07,561
Will you just kill the guy?

1328
01:32:07,595 --> 01:32:08,629
Please?

1329
01:32:09,330 --> 01:32:11,966
Now?
Yeah.

1330
01:32:11,999 --> 01:32:13,300
Thank you.

1331
01:32:33,854 --> 01:32:35,556
Where's the card?

1332
01:32:37,858 --> 01:32:38,893
The cash first.

1333
01:32:38,926 --> 01:32:40,795
I got your cash.

1334
01:32:58,813 --> 01:33:01,015
Kill the cop.
Move on the family.

1335
01:33:14,261 --> 01:33:16,230
Fuck.

1336
01:33:25,940 --> 01:33:27,975
I gotta do everything myself.

1337
01:33:41,922 --> 01:33:43,257
Get out of the way.

1338
01:34:07,848 --> 01:34:09,850
Motherfucker.

1339
01:34:17,158 --> 01:34:18,192
Hey!

1340
01:34:23,797 --> 01:34:25,132
Wish he'd have wrote.

1341
01:34:35,843 --> 01:34:38,078
Fuck!

1342
01:34:45,886 --> 01:34:46,921
How's the knee?

1343
01:35:09,176 --> 01:35:10,911
Guards!

1344
01:35:12,846 --> 01:35:13,914
Guards!

1345
01:35:22,823 --> 01:35:24,091
Guards!

1346
01:35:55,590 --> 01:35:57,424
Trick or treat, motherfucker!

1347
01:36:31,425 --> 01:36:33,528
I wanted this for a long time.

1348
01:36:34,261 --> 01:36:35,429
Fuck.

1349
01:37:32,620 --> 01:37:36,890
Sir, we found
Knight. Rhodes ran off.

1350
01:37:36,924 --> 01:37:39,326
Uh, what do you want us
to do about Knight, sir?

1351
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:42,162
Take him.

1352
01:37:42,196 --> 01:37:44,599
Don't move. Hold it.

1353
01:37:45,099 --> 01:37:46,967
Cuff him.

1354
01:37:50,971 --> 01:37:52,206
<i>We got him.</i>

1355
01:38:02,249 --> 01:38:03,417
Trick or treat.

1356
01:38:05,953 --> 01:38:08,422
The other house had
full-size candy bars.

1357
01:38:09,022 --> 01:38:11,291
Oh, thank you.

1358
01:38:11,325 --> 01:38:12,459
Come on.

1359
01:38:26,106 --> 01:38:28,041
You having fun?
Yeah.

1360
01:38:28,075 --> 01:38:29,343
Okay, good.

1361
01:38:44,224 --> 01:38:45,192
Wait.

1362
01:38:52,366 --> 01:38:55,202
- Hey. Hey.
- Casey?

1363
01:38:58,506 --> 01:38:59,607
No, no.

1364
01:39:02,276 --> 01:39:03,477
- Hands up.
- No.

1365
01:39:03,511 --> 01:39:05,045
Hands up!

1366
01:39:09,149 --> 01:39:10,184
Oh, my God.

1367
01:39:17,224 --> 01:39:19,426
No, sweetie. No. No.

1368
01:39:20,260 --> 01:39:23,363
You got the right
to remain silent. Easy.

1369
01:39:23,397 --> 01:39:24,732
Stop hurting my dad!

1370
01:39:24,766 --> 01:39:27,100
Oh, my God.

1371
01:39:27,134 --> 01:39:29,604
- Don't do anything to my dad!
- I'm sorry, baby. I'm so sorry!

1372
01:39:29,637 --> 01:39:31,371
I'll find a way
to make this right!
