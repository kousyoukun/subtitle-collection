00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,430
你应该说"求你了。"
You should've said "Please."

70

去你妈的，伙计。

这次我会抓住他们的。
I'll get 'em this time.

73

Hey... Get the fucking car. Let's go. What the fuck?

77

85
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:19,411
骑士，帮帮我。
Knight, help me.

86
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,040
凯西，我们能谈谈发生了什么事吗?
Casey, can we talk about what happened?

87
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,209
我参军不是为了杀警察的，伙计。
I didn't sign up to shoot cops, man.

88
00:07:24,045 --> 00:07:26,146
整个联邦调查局现在可能都在追我们。
The whole FBI is probably chasing us by now.

89
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:30,785
不是我们，就是他们。
It was us or them.

90
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,653
那个警察做好了他的工作，我们也做好了我们的。
That cop did his job, we did ours.

91
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:36,990
我们那天做得更好。 为了什么? 几千块?
We did it better on the day. For what? A couple grand?

92
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:43,096
六，七，八，减去温娜的那部分。 那就是，呃，134K。
Uh, six, seven, eight, minus Winna's cut. So, that's, uh, 134K.

93
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,465
134年?
134?

94
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:47,802
那就可以开枪打警察了吗?
That make it okay to shoot cops then?

95
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:51,771
不，我是说，是134。
No, but I mean, it's 134.

96
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,007
我们应该直接去维加斯吗?
Should we just head to Vegas?

97
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:56,110
来杯鸡尾酒。
Have a cocktail.

98
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,680
我下来。
I'm down.

99
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,584
哟。
Yo.

100
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:12,726
那到底是怎么回事?
So, what in the actual fuck was that about?

101
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:15,663
你让我处理好，我就处理好了。
You told me to take care of it, so I took care of it.

102
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:18,165
再说了，是你朝警察开枪的。
Besides, you're the one who shot the fucking cop.

103
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:20,100
因为我在帮你收拾烂摊子。
Because I was cleaning up your fucking mess.

104
00:08:20,134 --> 00:08:21,769
你一直这样告诉自己。
You keep telling yourself that.

105
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:24,704
你让我做点什么，我他妈照做了。
You told me to do something, and I fucking did it.

106
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:29,076
我是说，这比周日下午的pick 6强多了。
I mean, that was better than a fucking Pick 6 on a Sunday fucking afternoon.

107
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,310
这不是重点。
That's not the point of it.

108
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,278
哇,哇。 你想说什么?
Whoa, whoa. What's your point?

109
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:33,980
你不仅把我置于危险之中，
You not only put my life in danger,

110
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,649
你他妈想害我们的队友。
you tried to screw over our fucking teammates.

111
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,885
你以为我不支持你吗?
Do you think I don't have your fucking back?

112
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:41,087
嗯? 你是这个意思吗?
Huh? Is that what you're saying?

113
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,758
是你来找我说:“哦，我的膝盖骨折了。
You're the one coming to me, "Oh, my knee is busted.

114
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,759
哦,狗屎。 给我些该死的药。
Oh, shit. Give me some fucking pills.

115
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:48,328
来和我一起练习，这样我就能东山再起了。
Oh, come practice with me so I can make a fucking comeback.

116
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,164
哦，我的生活完了。” 嗯? 那是谁在管你?
Oh, my life is over." Huh? Who had your fucking back then?

117
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,801
你让我去，我就去了。
You asked me to go, and I fucking go.

118
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,235
去你妈的，凯西。
Fuck you, Casey.

119
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,605
你知道我干这行不是为了钱。
You know I'm not in this for the money.

120
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,325
-让开，让开。 -过来了。
- Move, move. - Coming through.

121
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:20,226
所有人，请让开。
Everybody, please get out of the way.

122
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,869
嘿。 是的，我们做到了。
Hey. Yeah, we made it.

123
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:03,370
你他妈的飞机晚点了。
Your fuckin' plane was late.

124
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:11,211
默瑟走了。
Well, Mercer went off.

125
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:16,350
对，我们会在拉瓜迪亚因待四个小时。
Yeah, we'll be at LaGuardia in four hours.

126
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:18,985
不，去他的洛杉矶。 去你妈的，默瑟。
No, fuck LA. Oh, fuck Mercer.

127
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:20,821
我再也不跟他合作了。
I'm never working with him again.

128
00:10:22,423 --> 00:10:23,791
再见。
Bye.

129
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,172
哇!
Whoo!

130
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:17,311
是的。 好吧，我把麦沙的分成给他。
Yeah. All right, I'll get Mercer's cut to him.

131
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:18,345
谢谢你！
Thank you.

132
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:21,315
138 k。 这是温娜的那份。
138K. This is Winna's cut.

133
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,448
嘿,案例。
Hey, Case.

134
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,418
我知道上次，一切都毁了。
I know the last time, it went to shit.

135
00:11:26,287 --> 00:11:28,288
但我一直在努力。
But I've been working on something.

136
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:30,724
我在youtube上看过这家伙，超级合法。
I watch this guy on YouTube, super legit.

137
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:33,159
你猜怎么着? 我模仿他。
And guess what? I copied him.

138
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:36,297
我在想，下次…
And I was thinking, for next time...

139
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,831
你他妈在说什么，伙计?
The fuck are you talking about, man?

140
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,000
坚持这个想法。
Hold that thought.

141
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:50,344
一件容易的事。 放松，放松，放松。
Easy. Easy, easy, easy.

142
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,078
一件容易的事。
Easy.

143
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,147
什么…
What the...

144
00:11:56,518 --> 00:11:57,750
一个该死的管状炸弹?
A fucking pipe bomb?

145
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:04,525
马上把那东西拿出去。
Get that out of here right now.

146
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,927
如果我们需要转移注意力，我们可以利用它。
If we need a distraction, we could use it.

147
00:12:06,961 --> 00:12:09,964
然后国土安全局就会一直盯着你们，直到永远。
Then we'll have Homeland Security on your asses for, like, the end of time.

148
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:11,164
这是你造的?
You built this?

149
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,499
从零开始，兄弟。
From scratch, bro.

150
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:14,168
YouTube上的那个人，
That guy from YouTube,

151
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:16,102
他可以教一个蹒跚学步的孩子做这些东西。
he could teach a toddler to make one of these things.

152
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,171
这是可怕的。
That's terrifying.

153
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:18,806
是的。
Yeah.

154
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,841
是啊，有点吓人。
Yeah, it kind of is terrifying.

155
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:23,244
哇。 你要我把它处理掉吗?
Whoa. You want me to get rid of it?

156
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:26,413
是的! 很明显。 我都不敢相信这是真的对话。
Yes! Obviously. I can't even believe this is a real conversation.

157
00:12:26,447 --> 00:12:31,051
我们把它藏起来，你知道，以防万一。
Let's stash it, you know, for an emergency.

158
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:33,254
你们两个都疯了。 我只是在考虑未来。
You're both insane. I'm just thinking ahead.

159
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:35,889
就像警监教我的，对吧，凯西?
Like Cap taught me, right, Case?

160
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,894
好吧,再见。
Okay, goodbye.

161
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,197
来吧。 你有点被压扁了。 你要去哪里?
Come on. You're a little bit impressed. Where are you going?

162
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,567
Out.Sykes。
Out. Sykes.

163
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,568
等等，等等，赛克斯。

明晚我有个小聚会。
I'm having a little get-together tomorrow night.

几个人。 如果你想过来，就过来吧。
Couple of people. If you wanna come by, just come by.

166
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:54,375
也许吧。
Maybe.

167
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:56,210
再见。
Bye.

168
00:12:57,845 --> 00:12:59,078
她是怎么回事?
What's her deal?

169
00:13:00,615 --> 00:13:01,914
再见,赛克斯。
Bye, Sykes.

170
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:02,950
再见!
Bye!

171
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:05,184
她说得对，你知道吗?
She's right, you know?

172
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,821
你疯了。
You are insane.

173
00:13:09,056 --> 00:13:10,356
没有，但我喜欢。
No, but I love it.

174
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:13,326
我的男人。
My man.

175
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,364
现在…
Now...

176
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,302
你是怎么做到的?
How'd you do this?

177
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:23,070
我很高兴你问了。
I'm actually glad you asked.

178
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,480
你是怎么做到的?
How do you do that?

179
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,118
大量的练习。
Lots of practice.

180
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:40,854
你怎么能跑错地方
How can you be at the wrong place

181
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:43,323
总是在正确的时间?

182
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:46,561
这些人在喷洒和祈祷。
These guys were spraying and praying.

183
00:13:46,594 --> 00:13:49,229
有一半的可能他们会打你或菲兹
<i>It was 50/50 that they would have hit you or Fitz.</i>

184
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:52,099
总有一天，你的运气会用光的，牛仔。

他会挺过去的。

抓住这伙人的唯一办法就是行动。
The only way to catch this crew is in the act.

189
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,517
你有什么想法吗?

190
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:12,952
那些人很聪明，训练有素。
Those guys are smart, trained.

191
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:16,222
我是说，他们只偷了一点点现金

192
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:19,594
还有一副旧的棒球训练卡片。

这组人很紧。 他们像一个团队一样行动。

196
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,202
嗯。

197
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,269
是的,但是…
Yeah, but...

你知道吗，其他队员认为
You know, the rest of the team think

202
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:43,417
我比你更疯狂才会这么想
that I'm crazier than you for thinking like this,

203
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,686
但听我说完。
but hear me out.

204
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:46,386
那些人不是本地人。

幽灵飞机。

大便。 你认识他吗?

那不是我们的管辖范围。

我们就叫外卖吧，好吗?

我看太多的油脂对孩子不好。

好吧，就是杂货。 你有现金吗?
Okay, groceries it is. You got cash?

255
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:26,445
哦,不。 工头欠我一张支票。 我去拿。
Uh, no. The foreman owes me a check. I'm gonna go pick it up.

256
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,516

Where? Where?

257
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:30,416

是的。 建筑工作。
Yes. The construction job.

262
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:40,627
嗯。 这是奇怪的,
Hmm. That's strange,

263
00:17:40,662 --> 00:17:42,829
因为那个街区没有施工。
'cause there isn't a construction going on on that block.

264
00:17:42,864 --> 00:17:44,699
是的，就在它旁边。
Yeah, it's right by it.

265
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,601
我昨天开车经过，

266
00:17:46,634 --> 00:17:48,736
因为克拉拉想看看她爸爸上班的时候。 耶稣基督。

Is that... Is that so wrong? I'm working.

269
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:54,473

270
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:56,743
供养这个家庭。
On providing for this family.

271
00:17:56,778 --> 00:17:59,681
凯西，你要是进了监狱就没法养家了。
Casey, you can't provide for this family if you're in a fucking jail cell.

272
00:17:59,713 --> 00:18:02,517
哦,不。 我没法靠朝九晚五的工作养家糊口，亲爱的。 好吗?
Oh, no. I can't provide for this family with a nine-to-five, darling. Okay?

273
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:03,684
这还不够。 对吧?嗯。
That's not enough. Right? Hmm.

274
00:18:03,718 --> 00:18:05,184
听着，我要求不多。
Look, I'm not asking for much.

275
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:06,486
哦，胡说八道。
Oh, that's bullshit.

276
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,622
废话?胡说!
Bullshit? Bullshit!

277
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:08,722
-废话? -是的!
- Bullshit? - Yeah!

278
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:10,825
你喜欢过去的生活方式。
You love that old lifestyle.

279
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:13,259
你嫁给了一个不会再踢橄榄球的四分卫。
You married a quarterback who can't play football anymore.

280
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,563
好吧? 可怜的女人，不得不和一个过时的人住在贫民窟里。
Okay? Poor woman, having to slum it with a has-been.

281
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:18,799
但这就是你得到的。 这是真实的世界，好吗?
But this is what you got. This is the real world, okay?

282
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:22,134
我为你拼了命，现在我来了。
I bust my ass for you, and I am here.

283
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:23,837
你在这里吗? 是的，我在这里。
You're here? Yes, I'm here.

284
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,373
你以为你在这里? 不，你他妈不在这里。
You think you're here? No, you're not fucking here.

285
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,909
有一半时间，你都在吃止痛药。
Half the time, you're on pain pills.

286
00:18:27,942 --> 00:18:29,544
你他妈的就像个僵尸。
You're like a fucking zombie.

287
00:18:30,344 --> 00:18:31,511
我能理解。
And I-I understand.

288
00:18:31,546 --> 00:18:33,413
我知道你的身体经历了什么，
I see what you put your body through,

289
00:18:34,949 --> 00:18:37,785
但你他妈是个瘾君子，凯西
but you're a fucking drug addict, Casey.

290
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:39,787
这很好。
That's nice.

291
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,188
这是事实。
It's the truth.

292
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:44,692
嘿,亲爱的。 嘿。
Hey, darling. Hey.

293
00:18:44,726 --> 00:18:46,861
嗨,嗨。 我很抱歉…啊。
Hi, hey. I'm sorry... Ugh.

294
00:18:46,894 --> 00:18:47,929
没关系。
It's okay.

295
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,864
.．. 爸爸在尖叫。
...that Daddy's screaming.

296
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:53,366
你给考伯恩教练回过电话吗?
Did you ever call Coach Cogburn back?

297
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:59,405
嗯,没有。 我才不要为18美元一小时工作。 好吧?
Um, no. I'm not working for $18 an hour. All right?

298
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:03,544
然后爸爸就得每天工作90个小时… 这是不可能的…
Then Daddy would have to work for 90 hours a day... and that's not possible...

299
00:19:03,577 --> 00:19:05,444
这样我就能养活你了。
So I could provide for you.

300
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,582
供养我?
To provide for me?

301
00:19:07,615 --> 00:19:09,249
是的。 是的，你知道我的意思。
Yeah. Yeah, you know what I mean.

302
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,317
你们能明白我的心情
You know what I mean.

303
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:12,619
是的,是的。
Yeah, yeah.

304
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:18,792
过来，好吗? 嘿,我…
Come here, okay? Hey, I...

305
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,395
我爱你。 我很抱歉。 我只是…
I love you. I'm sorry. I just...

306
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:23,798
我爱你，好吗?
I love you, okay?

307
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,566
不。 你喜欢惹我生气。
No. You love getting under my skin.

308
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,667
这是真的。
It's true.

309
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:27,934
这就跟你问声好！
Hi!

310
00:19:27,969 --> 00:19:29,336
嗨。
Hi.

311
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:32,673
听着，我真的什么都不需要了
Look, I really just don't need anything more

312
00:19:32,707 --> 00:19:34,509
比我们这里的要多。
than what we have right here.

313
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:39,413
好吗?
Okay?

314
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:44,652
我走了，你看着妈妈。 好的。
You watch your mama while I'm gone. Okay.

315
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:46,252
好吗?
Okay?

316
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:47,888
我们会挑选一些服装。
We'll pick out some costumes.

317
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:50,190
等我回来再挑。 好吧。
We'll pick 'em when I get back. All right.

318
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:52,794
好的。
Okay.

319
00:19:53,894 --> 00:19:55,762
去吃你的三明治，好吗? 好的。
Go eat your sandwich, okay? Okay.

320
00:19:55,797 --> 00:19:56,830
好的。
Okay.

321
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:02,829
膝盖怎么样了，香肠?
How's the knee, sausage?

322
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:06,634
很糟糕，但谢谢你的关心。
Uh, it's pretty awful, but thank you for asking.

323
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,971
你知道吗，如果你想给我按摩，我有虎脂。
You know, I got some Tiger Balm if you wanna, uh, rub me up.

324
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:12,673
你愿意吗? 哦，我真的，真的想。
You'd like that? Oh, I really, really would.

325
00:21:12,707 --> 00:21:14,040
嗯。
Hmm.

326
00:21:15,977 --> 00:21:17,376
你知道规矩的。
You know the rules.

327
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,346
去后面帮忙，好吗?
Help goes around back, okay?

328
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,413
你的口气，伙计，真恶心。
Your breath, man, it's disgusting.

329
00:21:25,787 --> 00:21:28,789
拱起你的背。 松开你的手。
Arch your back. Loosen your grip.

330
00:21:29,624 --> 00:21:32,491
当你准备好了，挥杆就好。
And when you're ready, just take a swing.

331
00:21:32,527 --> 00:21:33,760
好了!
Nice!

332
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,664
所以你觉得你很有趣?
So you think you're funny?

333
00:21:37,698 --> 00:21:38,766
不是… 不是真的。
Not... Not really.

334
00:21:39,534 --> 00:21:41,701
滚出去。 上班时间到了。
Get out of here. It's business time.

335
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,407
-嗯，高尔夫球? 这不是你的运动。 -哦。
- Yeah, uh, golf? Not really your sport. - Oh.

336
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:50,944
你有没有考虑过，快步走?
Have you ever considered, uh, power walking?

337
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:52,747
哦，原来你很有趣。
Oh, so you are funny.

338
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:54,749
布里格，揍他。
Brigga, punch him.

339
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:03,990
-你做了吗? -这事都解决了，告诉我吧。
- Did you do it yet? - Now that's out of the way, tell me all about it.

340
00:22:04,025 --> 00:22:06,027
嗯，怎么样?
Um, how'd it go?

341
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:08,829
嗯…
Uh...

342
00:22:08,863 --> 00:22:11,397
-那只是一段美好的时光，伙计。 -是吗?
- It was nothing but a good time, man. - Yeah?

343
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:13,365
是的。 令人兴奋的。 你拿到钱了吗?
Yeah. Exciting. You got the money?

344
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,635
我拿到钱了。 给你，一分钱都给你。
I got the money. Here you go, every cent.

345
00:22:16,737 --> 00:22:17,771
Brigga。
Brigga.

346
00:22:19,574 --> 00:22:21,107
告诉我更多。 对吧?
Tell me more. Right?

347
00:22:21,142 --> 00:22:23,611
就像他们说的，给我看看日报。 走了。
Show me the dailies, as they say. Go.

348
00:22:23,644 --> 00:22:26,146
比任何触地得分都好。
Better than any touchdown.

349
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:30,050
这就是我说的。 一个对工作充满热情的人。
That's what I'm talking about. A man who's passionate about his work.

350
00:22:30,084 --> 00:22:33,054
好了，现在我们来谈正事。 教练和队长。
All right, real talk now. Coach and the captain.

351
00:22:33,621 --> 00:22:35,422
我确实看到了烟花。
I did see the fireworks.

352
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,557
是啊，我们搞定了。
Yeah, we got it done. No.

353
00:22:37,592 --> 00:22:40,862
不，你得到的是热度。
No, what you got was heat.

354
00:22:40,894 --> 00:22:43,430
警察要我们俩的头因为我们点着了那个警探。
The cops want both our heads now for lighting up that detective.

355
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,098
-是吗? 那又怎样? 谁在乎呢? -那又怎样?
- Yeah? So what? Who cares? - So what?

356
00:22:45,132 --> 00:22:47,134
工作的危险性。 这工作有危险吗?
Hazard of the job. Oh, hazard of the job?

357
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:50,738
-是啊，工作很危险。 你在警局里有内奸。 -那又怎样?
- Yeah, hazard of the job. You have some rats on the force. - What of it?

358
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:53,941
那么他们的观点是什么? 有人认出我们吗? 据我所知没有。
So what's their take? Anyone ID us? Not that I heard.

359
00:22:55,142 --> 00:22:56,943
但如果你能忍受酷热，
But if you can stand the heat,

360
00:22:58,778 --> 00:23:00,847
我可能还有别的工作给你。
I might have another job for you.

361
00:23:00,882 --> 00:23:01,949
是的。
Yeah.

362
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:06,686
来吧，拿着。
Come on, take it.

363
00:23:14,862 --> 00:23:16,163
on.Nah来。
Come on. Nah.

364
00:23:16,196 --> 00:23:18,199
他们说它会卖120万美元。
They say it'll sell for $1.2 million.

365
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:20,968
120万美元。 这很了不起，对吧?
$1.2 million. That's extraordinary, right?

366
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:22,869
想想吧。 如果你能做到，
Think about it. If you can get that,

367
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:25,105
给你和你的团队每人20万。
that's like 200K each for you and your crew.

368
00:23:26,941 --> 00:23:27,974
250.
250.

369
00:23:28,009 --> 00:23:29,576
250乘以5，算算。
250 times five, do the math.

370
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:32,078
我应该自己买的。 220.
I should just buy the thing myself. 220.

371
00:23:32,113 --> 00:23:34,915
我没和麦沙合作。 这次是三人小组。
I'm not working with Mercer. Three-man team this time.

372
00:23:34,949 --> 00:23:36,616
这不是我的问题。
It's not my problem.

373
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,986
好吧。 好吧?
All right. All right?

374
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:40,721
是的。 把钱准备好。 给我滚出去。
Yeah. Get the money ready. Get the fuck out of here.

375
00:23:40,755 --> 00:23:41,888
好吧。 好了，走吧。
All right. All right, go.

376
00:23:46,027 --> 00:23:47,595
把那个女孩带回来。
Bring back the girl.

377
00:23:55,169 --> 00:23:58,605
是啊，我刚收拾完家具，一会儿就回家。
Yeah, I'm just finishing up here, and I'll be home in a little bit.

378
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:01,473
不，没关系，很好。
No, that's okay. Perfect.

379
00:24:02,242 --> 00:24:03,611
再见。
Bye.

380
00:24:28,702 --> 00:24:29,869
来吧。 不是现在。
Come on. Not now.

381
00:24:29,903 --> 00:24:31,038
好吧。
All right.

382
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:45,152
嘿。
Hey.

383
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:48,088
怎么了，戴夫? 你好吗?
What's up, Dave? How you doing?

384
00:24:50,724 --> 00:24:52,692
嘿,冠军。 哥哥,'sup什么? 嘿,男人。
Hey, champ. What's up, brother? Hey, man.

385
00:24:52,727 --> 00:24:54,894
这他妈是什么? 怎么，我不能开派对吗?
What the fuck is this? What, I can't have a party?

386
00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:57,230
一个被大都会队抛弃的家伙怎么可能
How the fuck does a guy who got dropped by the Mets

387
00:24:57,263 --> 00:24:59,066
在他爸爸的垃圾场里捡废品
and hauls scrap at his dad's junkyard

388
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:00,800
花钱办这样的派对，是吧?
pay for a party like this, huh?

389
00:25:00,835 --> 00:25:03,770
第一条规则，对吧? 别炫耀你的钱。
First rule, right? Don't flash your fucking cash.

390
00:25:03,804 --> 00:25:06,673
你做了什么… 你的现金是怎么花的? 谢谢关心。
What did you do... What did you do with your cash? Thanks for asking.

391
00:25:06,707 --> 00:25:09,076
我在攒钱，这样我就能离开这鬼地方了
I'm saving it, so I can get the fuck out of this neighborhood

392
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:10,711
买新朋友。
and buy new friends.

393
00:25:11,444 --> 00:25:14,048
伙计，我不想让你进监狱。
Dude, I don't want you to go to jail.

394
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,950
好吧，好吧。
All right, all right.

395
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:19,586
但我们在这里。 这是一个聚会。 好好享受吧，伙计。 喝杯啤酒。
But we're here. It's a party. Enjoy it, man. Have a beer.

396
00:25:20,621 --> 00:25:22,655
你吓死我了，天啊。
You're freaking me out. Jesus.

397
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:27,127
嗨，康定斯基女士。
Hi, Ms. Kandinsky.

398
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:29,997
温娜说了什么?
What did Winna say?

399
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,065
嗯…
Um...

400
00:25:32,165 --> 00:25:34,101
温娜说我们做得很好。
Winna said we did good work.

401
00:25:34,134 --> 00:25:36,770
我们可能会因为警察的事而产生矛盾。
And that we maybe have some heat for the cop thing.

402
00:25:36,804 --> 00:25:40,775
但警察没死
But the cop didn't die,

403
00:25:40,807 --> 00:25:42,977
所以，你知道，事情会过去的。
so, you know, it should blow over.

404
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:45,346
那是从他的老鼠身上来的?
That come from his rat?

405
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:47,815
不。 他们以前没有，以后也不会
No. They didn't ID any of us and they won't

406
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:50,683
只要我们闭上嘴，别开什么该死的派对。
as long as we keep our mouths shut and don't throw fucking parties.

407
00:25:53,653 --> 00:25:55,756
不过我有个好消息。 嘿。
Uh, but I got some good news. Hey.

408
00:25:57,023 --> 00:25:58,858
嗨。
Hi there.

409
00:25:58,893 --> 00:26:01,362
温娜为我们安排了另一场表演。 哦，得了吧。
Uh, Winna's got another gig lined up for us. Oh, come on.

410
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:03,897
我在。 你为什么要继续和这家伙合作?
I'm in. Why do you want to keep working with this guy?

411
00:26:03,931 --> 00:26:06,634
因为他在五个月内给了我们五场演出。
'Cause he's given us five gigs in five months.

412
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:10,938
他有一架飞机可以载我们去任何地方，任何时候抢劫。
Uh, he's got a jet to fly us anywhere, take any heist anytime.

413
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:13,807
我有说过我们要拿到220美元吗?
And did I mention the part that we're getting 220?

414
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,810
哇,220 ? 220年。
Whoa, 220? 220.

415
00:26:16,844 --> 00:26:20,614
那该死的警察呢? 别他妈跟警察吵了。 请,好吗?
What about the fucking cop? Enough with the fucking cop. Please, okay?

416
00:26:20,647 --> 00:26:22,148
他没死，对吧? 他是好的。
He didn't die, right? He's okay.

417
00:26:22,182 --> 00:26:24,085
会得到报酬的。 会没事的。
Gonna get paid. It's gonna be fine.

418
00:26:24,117 --> 00:26:26,019
是的。 也许… 也许我们帮了他一个忙。
Yeah. maybe... maybe we did him a favor.

419
00:26:26,053 --> 00:26:28,923
好吧，也许不是帮忙，但是…
Okay, maybe not a favor, but...

420
00:26:28,955 --> 00:26:30,857
那家伙只是在做他的工作。
That guy was doing his job.

421
00:26:30,891 --> 00:26:32,759
我们也是，好吗?
So were we, okay?

422
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:34,961
突然之间，你就变成了一颗善良的心的银行劫匪了?
Suddenly, you're a bank robber with a heart of gold?

423
00:26:36,663 --> 00:26:38,699
凯西扣动了扳机，但我们都有罪。
Casey pulled the trigger, but we're all still guilty.

424
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:40,166
只是想让你知道。
Just wanna let you know that.

425
00:26:40,201 --> 00:26:42,936
你完蛋了。 你们都完蛋了。
You're all fucked. You're all so fucked.

426
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:46,039
所以去找神父忏悔吧。 但别在我的派对上。
So go see a priest and confess. Just not at my party.

427
00:26:46,073 --> 00:26:48,976
听着，赛克斯，如果你能振作起来，有良心，那没关系。
Look, Sykes, if you've just gone up and grown a conscience, that's fine.

428
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:51,278
你可以走着去。 我不会阻止你的。
You can walk. I'm not gonna stop you.

429
00:26:53,314 --> 00:26:55,082
但我需要你。
But I want you.

430
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,721
闭上你的臭嘴，告诉我比分是多少。
Shut the fuck up and just tell me what the score is.

431
00:27:04,424 --> 00:27:06,759
看看这个。
Check this out.

432
00:27:06,794 --> 00:27:08,695
哦，得了吧。
Oh, come on.

433
00:27:08,729 --> 00:27:10,029
这里。
Here.

434
00:27:10,064 --> 00:27:12,066
哦,狗屎。
Oh, shit.

435
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:14,367
不，我们要走了。 为真实的。 滚蛋。
No, we're gonna die. For real. Fuck off.

436
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,904
不。 One-of-a-kindcollector的项
No. One-of-a-kind collector's item

437
00:27:17,938 --> 00:27:20,106
在拍卖会上出售。
that sells at an auction.

438
00:27:20,141 --> 00:27:23,676
伙计们，这是我们的工作，对吧?
Guys, um, we do this job, right?

439
00:27:23,711 --> 00:27:26,380
我们会有一笔不错的养老金存款。
We're gonna have a nice little deposit for our pensions.

440
00:27:28,715 --> 00:27:31,285
来吧。 我见过。 都在我脑子里了。
Come on. I've seen it. I got it all in my head.

441
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:33,386
我知道所有的角度。 我们可以做到的。
I know all the angles. We can do this.

442
00:27:36,056 --> 00:27:38,057
除非我有我的团队，否则我就走。
I'm gonna pass unless I have my team.

443
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:40,394
那默瑟呢?
What about Mercer?

444
00:27:40,426 --> 00:27:42,762
去他的默瑟，好吗?
Fuck Mercer, okay?

445
00:27:42,796 --> 00:27:45,900
我这里有个牛仔。 我不了解默瑟。
I got one fucking cowboy right here. I don't know about Mercer.

446
00:27:48,067 --> 00:27:49,470
很好。 我在。
Fine. I'm in.

447
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:51,905
我们去偷韦恩·格雷茨基吧。 吃个意大利腊肠。
Let's go steal Wayne Gretzky. Have a salami.

448
00:27:51,939 --> 00:27:53,240
去你妈的。 滚蛋。
Fuck you. Fuck off.

449
00:27:53,273 --> 00:27:55,108
你买不起暖气?
You couldn't afford a heater?

450
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:02,916
每一个动作都应该提高你的位置或伤害敌人。
Every move should improve your position or hurt the enemy.

451
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:06,053
这是战场。 永远不要忘记你们奋斗的目的。
This is a battlefield. And never forget why you're fighting.

452
00:28:07,922 --> 00:28:09,423
现在，骑士。
Now, the knight.

453
00:28:09,455 --> 00:28:11,759
骑士是棋盘上最危险的棋子。
The knight is the most dangerous piece on the board.

454
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:15,296
骑士可以在你最意想不到的时候发动攻击。
The knight can strike when you least expect it.

455
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:20,134
骑士的行动方式大多数人都无法理解。
The knight moves in ways most people won't understand.

456
00:28:27,074 --> 00:28:30,411
现在，管他呢? 你他妈怎么… 我的保安去哪了?
Now, what the hell? How the fuck did you... Where the fuck is my security?

457
00:28:30,443 --> 00:28:31,845
Brigga在哪?
Where's Brigga?

458
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:34,013
希望我没有打扰到你们。
I hope I'm not, uh, interrupting.

459
00:28:34,048 --> 00:28:37,151
警探，你离家可真远，知道吗?
Detective, you're a long way from home, you know that?

460
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:39,286
-你是谁? -加油。
- Who are you? - San go.

461
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,921
哦,一厢情愿。

462
00:28:40,954 --> 00:28:43,490
欢迎来到我简陋的堡垒。

463
00:28:43,525 --> 00:28:46,160
-这地方很适合赌马的人 -谢谢。
- Nice place for a bookie. - Thanks.

464
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:48,362
是啊，我们说如果一项运动有赢家，
Yeah, we say if there's a sport with a winner,

465
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:50,964
还有一个输家愿意在上面下注。
then there's also a loser that was willing to bet on it.

466
00:28:50,998 --> 00:28:53,366
-我们需要谈谈。 -有话要说吗? 我有话要说。
- We need a word. - You need a word? I got a word.

467
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,401
“律师”。
"Lawyer."

468
00:28:54,434 --> 00:28:55,935
律师?
Lawyer?

469
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:58,506
我还有四个字。 “跟我的律师说。”
I got four more words. "Speak to my lawyer."

470
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:01,474
如你所见，我正在上课呢。
As you can see, I'm in the middle of a lesson here.

471
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:06,548
你知道这是谁吗? 这是历史上最年轻的国际象棋大师。
Do you know who this is? This is the youngest chess master in history.

472
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,048
嗯，对他有好处。
Well, good for him.

473
00:29:08,082 --> 00:29:11,085
嘿，这是我的家。 好吧?
Hey, this is my home. All right?

474
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:12,185
放尊重点。
Show some respect.

475
00:29:12,219 --> 00:29:14,288
我为这些小丑道歉。

476
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,057
孩子，去学一项真正的运动吧。

坐下。

00:29:24,265 --> 00:29:26,400
现在，警探们，跟我谈谈。
Now, detectives, talk to me.

479
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:28,434
我能为你做些什么?
What can I do you for?

480
00:29:28,469 --> 00:29:30,837
我们知道你的一切，温娜。

因内幕交易被高盛开除。

You were a CI for the local PD and feds.

484
00:29:40,114 --> 00:29:42,982
你找到我的维基百科页面了，是吗?
Oh, so you found my Wikipedia page, did you?

485
00:29:43,017 --> 00:29:46,452
我很高兴政府终于招到识字的人了。
And I'm glad to see the government's finally hiring guys who can read.

486
00:29:46,487 --> 00:29:50,023
告诉我，如果我把你的口袋翻出来，
So tell me, if I turn your pockets inside out,

487
00:29:50,057 --> 00:29:51,258
我会发现什么?
what am I going to find?

488
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:53,359
我不知道。 你会发现什么?
I don't know. What will you find?

489
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:56,963
也许是一场侵犯我公民自由的诉讼?
Perhaps a lawsuit for breaching my civil liberties?

490
00:29:56,997 --> 00:29:58,365
真的吗?是的。
Really? Yeah.

491
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:00,300
你认识很多前职业运动员。

做点划痕。

493
00:30:02,036 --> 00:30:03,903

我想找几个来干一件脏活。

据我所知没有。
Not to the best of my recollection.

498
00:30:13,515 --> 00:30:14,815
好好想想。
Think real hard.

499
00:30:15,449 --> 00:30:17,017
这对我有什么好处?
And what's in it for me?

500
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,986
在我家吃圣诞晚餐。
Christmas dinner at my place.

501
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:20,153

00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:22,288
我还是算了吧。
I think I'll pass.

503
00:30:22,323 --> 00:30:25,092
这比另一种选择好。
Well, better than the alternative.

504
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:26,528
那是什么?
And what's that?

505

你在他家吃晚饭。
You have dinner at his.

506

下次先打个电话吧。

我去看看门是不是锁好了。

508
00:30:35,035 --> 00:30:39,006
如果你替他们打掩护，我会查清楚的。
If you're covering for them, I'll find out.

509
00:30:41,107 --> 00:30:42,875
你是在威胁我吗，警探?
Now, is that a threat, Detective?

510
00:30:44,978 --> 00:30:46,913
这里有很多财产。

517
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:46,940
你有什么发现?
What do you got?

518
00:31:49,143 --> 00:31:50,176

卡车劫案呢?
What about the truck heist?

520
00:31:55,015 --> 00:31:58,285
我什么都不知道，但如果我知道的话…
I don't know anything about it, but if I did know something about it...

521
00:32:00,253 --> 00:32:01,422
我会看着凯西·罗德斯。
I would look at Casey Rhodes.

522

凯西罗德?

是啊，看看他。
Yeah, look to him.

00:32:07,628 --> 00:32:10,196
是的，我在哪里能找到他?
Yeah, where can I find him?

525
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,499
我不会替你做你的工作，伙计。
I'm not gonna do your fucking job for you, buddy.

526
00:32:12,534 --> 00:32:15,335
我不应该解释为什么这不能回到Winna。
And I shouldn't have to explain why this can't come back to Winna.

527
00:32:15,368 --> 00:32:17,003
<i>不要忘记。</i>
<i>Don't forget.</i>

528

现在给我滚出去。

00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:46,333
是的。
Yeah.

534
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:48,201
下一个有消息吗?
Any news on the next one?

535
00:32:48,234 --> 00:32:50,704
还没有。 我会告诉你的。
Uh, nothing yet. I'll let you know.

536
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:56,009
没有序列号。 完整的处女。

539
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:03,349
凯西罗兹。
Casey Rhodes.

540
00:33:05,352 --> 00:33:07,354
-把它给… -我才不要回监狱，伙计
- Give that to... - I'm not going back to jail, man.

541
00:33:07,386 --> 00:33:09,222

我能看一下你的身份证吗?

我想我把它落在家里了。

你呢? 你,呃… 你有身份证吗?
What about you? Do you, uh... Do you have your ID?

快他妈上车。 我们走吧。

562
00:34:03,343 --> 00:34:04,711
<i>骑士，帮帮我。</i>
<i>Knight, help me.</i>

563
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:10,416
是啊，你他妈的想要签名吗?
Yeah, you want a fuckin' autograph?

564
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:14,487
骑士，你没事吧?

00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:20,561
我说的是你，不是你。

嗯。 你们… 你认识温娜吗?

569
00:34:26,501 --> 00:34:28,268
世界真小。
It's a small world.

570
00:34:28,302 --> 00:34:31,405
也许我们可以一起吃个早午餐什么的。

队长。 谢伊船长。

他不是我的搭档。

587
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,762
有什么事吗，警探?
What can I do for you, Detective?

588
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:31,532
我们来这里是为了表示善意。
We're here as a gesture of goodwill.

589
00:35:31,565 --> 00:35:33,800
我在想我们能不能分享一下信息。
I was wondering if we could share information.

590
00:35:33,835 --> 00:35:35,670
你已经越权了。
You're out of your jurisdiction.

591
00:35:36,903 --> 00:35:42,309
队长，我们有个警察正在与死神搏斗。
Captain, we have a cop who is right now fighting for his life.

592
00:35:43,911 --> 00:35:47,648
奈特警探得到了一些关于他一个老朋友的线索。
Detective Knight had some leads regarding some old friend of his.

593
00:35:47,681 --> 00:35:49,349

594
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,818
老的朋友吗?
Old friend?

00:35:51,853 --> 00:35:54,221
是啊，他可能是个赌马经纪人或者线人。
Yeah, he might have been a bookie or CI.

596
00:35:54,253 --> 00:35:56,757
只是奈特的老朋友。
Just an old friend of Knight.

597
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:59,326
他认识他还是“他认识他”?
Does he know him or "he knew him"?

598
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:04,264
骑士可能会很虚弱，
Knight might be rough around the edges,

599
00:36:04,297 --> 00:36:05,766
但他是个好警察。
but he's a good cop.

600
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,199
嗯哼。
Mm-hmm.

601
00:36:07,233 --> 00:36:08,467
有什么具体的消息吗?
Got anything concrete?

602
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:12,239
温娜是安保主管，布里格。
Winna's head of security, Brigga.

603
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:14,240
他和凯西·罗兹一起踢足球。
He played football with Casey Rhodes.

604
00:36:14,273 --> 00:36:15,742
我猜他们是闹翻了，
I guess they had a falling out,

605
00:36:15,777 --> 00:36:18,646
因为他牵连凯西和他的团伙参与了抢劫
because he implicated Casey and his crew in the heist.

606
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:20,882
他们把行踪掩盖得很好。
They cover their tracks very well.

607
00:36:20,914 --> 00:36:23,550
击中目标，然后像幽灵一样消失。
Hit the target and disappear like ghosts.

608
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:25,853
警探，我认识你的队长。
Look, Detective, I know your captain.

609
00:36:25,887 --> 00:36:28,255
她为你担保，但不是你的搭档。
She vouched for you, but not your partner.

610
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,623
她把他的档案发给了我。
She sent me his file.

611
00:36:29,657 --> 00:36:32,391
这是部门的意见
It is the opinion of the department

612
00:36:32,425 --> 00:36:34,661
如果詹姆斯·奈特不是在追捕银行劫匪
that if James Knight wasn't hunting bank robbers,

613
00:36:34,695 --> 00:36:36,496
他会抢银行。
he'd be robbing banks.

614
00:36:37,065 --> 00:36:38,965
他是个有警徽的恶棍。
He's a thug with a badge.

615
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,867
如果他们再袭击，我会给你许可。
If they strike again, I'll give you clearance.

616
00:36:40,902 --> 00:36:42,836
但别挡我们的路。
But stay out of our way.

617
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:44,639
欢迎来到纽约，警探。

在我的城市玩得开心。 嗯。

619
00:37:02,023 --> 00:37:04,692
那球进了! 别他妈挡道。 那球进了!
That was in! Get the fuck out of the way. That was in!

620
00:37:04,726 --> 00:37:06,860
你瞎了吗? 那个该死的裁判是谁?
What are you, blind? Who the fuck is that ref, huh?

621
00:37:06,893 --> 00:37:09,864
他是个死人，他就是这样。
He's a dead man, that's who he is.

622
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:13,400
你们的工作做得很好，好吗? 你们现在都为我工作，好吗?
You guys are good at what you do, all right? You both work for me now, okay?

623
00:37:13,432 --> 00:37:15,737
25%，你拿。 不许砍，不然我就流血了。
25%, your take. No cutting or I take it out in blood.

624
00:37:15,769 --> 00:37:17,838
我在开玩笑，但不是真的。
I'm kidding, but not really.

625
00:37:19,974 --> 00:37:21,509
什么?
What?

626
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:23,610
这是骑士。 他到底想要什么?
It's Knight. What the fuck does he want?

627
00:37:25,713 --> 00:37:27,280
把电话给我。
Give me that phone.

628
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:31,284
你他妈在干什么?
What the fuck are you doing?

629
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:33,554
你为什么要拿那个恶作剧戏弄我?
Why are you rolling on me with that jamoke, huh?

630
00:37:33,588 --> 00:37:35,355
我们达成共识了，警探。
We have an understanding, Detective.

631

</i> </i>

他们给他接上了生命维持系统
<i>They got him on life support.</i>

633
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:42,730
哦,好的。 嗯，这工作很危险。 送他一些花。
Oh, okay. Well, hazard of the job. Send him some flowers.

634
00:37:42,764 --> 00:37:44,396
谁开枪打了他?
Who shot him?

635
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:46,365
我他妈怎么知道谁开枪打了人
<i>How the fuck would I know who shot some guy</i>

636
00:37:46,398 --> 00:37:47,501
在你那肮脏的小城市里? </i>
<i>in your dirty little city?</i>

637
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:49,603
<i>我们和他说话了

对，凯西·罗兹。 还有他的朋友。
Yeah, Casey Rhodes. And his buddy.

他们都是正直的人。

我们都同意不问我们不想知道答案的问题。
We both agreed not to ask questions that we don't want answers to.

641
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:01,516
如果我得到罗兹枪杀菲兹的证据
<i>If I get the evidence that Rhodes shot Fitz...</i>

642
00:38:01,548 --> 00:38:04,851
嗯。 注意你的语气，警探。
Uh-uh. Watch that tone, Detective.

643
00:38:04,885 --> 00:38:07,755
<i>我可以打电话给内务部，让他们知道我们的小聊天
<i>I could always call IA and let them know about our little chat.</i>

644
00:38:07,789 --> 00:38:10,557
<i>我们现在互相威胁吗? </i>。
<i>We threatening each other now?</i> No.

645
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:13,594
不，我们不是。 现在，听我说。

646
00:38:13,628 --> 00:38:17,565
离罗兹和默瑟远点。
Back off from Rhodes and Mercer.

647
00:38:17,597 --> 00:38:19,766

Listen to me. No more empty threats, Detective.

650
00:38:24,938 --> 00:38:26,974
我想什么时候带你出去都行，
I can take you out whenever I want,

651
00:38:27,007 --> 00:38:29,010
<i>在任何我想要的地方? </i>
<i>wherever I want, okay?</i>

652
00:38:29,043 --> 00:38:32,045
如果你不相信我，我愿意给你演示一下。
If you don't believe me, I'd love to give you a demonstration.

653
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,014
菲兹还在重症监护室，对吧?
Fitz is still in the ICU, right?

654
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:36,416
我的一个电话，

你迟到了。
Uh, you're late.

658
00:38:58,773 --> 00:39:02,375
买块表怎么样? 你找到蓝图了吗?
How 'bout getting a fucking watch? You find the blueprints?

659
00:39:02,409 --> 00:39:06,646
是的。 但我调查了拜访你的那些警察。
Yeah. But I did some digging on those cops that paid you a visit.

660
00:39:08,148 --> 00:39:09,951
什么好吗?
Anything good?

661
00:39:09,983 --> 00:39:14,889

665
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:26,666
这很好。 那另一个人呢? 那个秃头的家伙。
That's good. What about the other guy? The bald guy.

666
00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:28,902
另一个秃头的?
The other bald one?

667
00:39:28,936 --> 00:39:30,670
啊哈。
Uh-huh.

668
00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:32,940
这就是詹姆斯·爱德华·奈特警探。
So that's Detective James Edward Knight.

669
00:39:32,974 --> 00:39:35,009
他曾在海军陆战队服役，退伍后，

00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:40,447
在他的车后座?
In the back of his car?

673
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,682
不,笨蛋。 纽瓦克。
No, dumb-ass. Newark.

674
00:39:44,117 --> 00:39:47,054
这上面写着他两年就当上了警探。
This says here that he made detective in two years.

675
00:39:47,088 --> 00:39:49,923
然后事情就变得超级有趣了。
And then here's where it gets, like, super interesting.

676
00:39:49,956 --> 00:39:53,159
九年前，奈特被调到洛杉矶。
Nine years ago, Knight is transferred to Los Angeles.

677
00:39:53,193 --> 00:39:54,896
为什么?
Why?

678
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:57,063
这一切都始于一个叫杰瑞·里奇的人，
This all starts with a guy named Jerry Leach,

679
00:39:57,097 --> 00:40:00,201
一个有前科的罪犯在一次持械抢劫中杀害了银行经理。
an ex-con who the cops liked for killing a bank manager during an armed robbery.

680
00:40:00,233 --> 00:40:02,168
快进几年后，</i>
<i>Fast forward a few years later,</i>

681
00:40:02,202 --> 00:40:04,704
内务部调查了奈特与一起不当班的枪击事件有关。
IA investigated Knight's involvement in an off-duty shooting.

682
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:06,206
死者，杰瑞·里奇。
The victim, Jerry Leach.

683
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:08,041
那个倒霉的银行经理是谁?
And who was the unlucky bank manager?

684
00:40:08,074 --> 00:40:10,610
奈特的父亲，威廉·奈特。
Knight's old man, William Knight.

685
00:40:10,644 --> 00:40:13,880
但最疯狂的是。 猜猜最后一个见到杰瑞·里奇活着的人是谁?
But here's the craziest part. Guess who the last person to see Jerry Leach alive was?

686
00:40:13,914 --> 00:40:14,949
-Winna ? -是的。
- Winna? - Yeah.

687
00:40:14,981 --> 00:40:16,717
Winna是一个CI。
Winna was a CI.

688
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:18,952
他肯定向利奇骑士泄露了行踪
He must have tipped off Knight to Leach's whereabouts

689
00:40:18,985 --> 00:40:21,088
作为对奈特的报答
in exchange for owning Knight a favor.

690
00:40:21,121 --> 00:40:23,456
目击者称他们什么都没看到
Witnesses claimed they didn't see anything,

691
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:25,126
内务部总是倾向于骑士。
the IA always leaning towards Knight.

692
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:28,061
他们达成协议，把他送去西部就是为了除掉他。
They made a deal to send him out west just to get rid of him.

693
00:40:28,094 --> 00:40:29,996
从那以后，奈特接了一些大案子。
Since then, Knight had caught some big cases.

694
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:32,699
但他离婚了，好像要参加纪律听证会
But he got divorced and seems to have some disciplinary hearing

695
00:40:32,733 --> 00:40:34,467
至少一年一次。
at least once a year.

696
00:40:34,501 --> 00:40:36,469
嘘。
Boo-hoo.

697
00:40:36,503 --> 00:40:38,172
我觉得我们不该夹在他们中间，
I don't think we should get between these guys,

698
00:40:38,204 --> 00:40:40,740
尤其是这个奈特想要凯西的人头。
especially with this Knight guy wanting Casey's head.

699
00:40:42,043 --> 00:40:45,146
如果他们有我们的把柄，我们早就被铐起来了，对吧?
If they had anything on us, we'd be in cuffs right now, right?

700
00:40:46,813 --> 00:40:48,114
所以我们继续。
So we proceed.

701
00:40:49,516 --> 00:40:50,550
蓝图。
Blueprints.

702
00:40:50,583 --> 00:40:52,052
正确的。
Right.

703
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,858
所以好消息是，有很多出口点。
So the good news is, there are plenty of exit points.

704
00:40:57,891 --> 00:41:01,128
好吧，也就是说我们有很多地方会被抓，对吧?
All right, which means there's plenty of places for us to get caught, right?

705
00:41:01,161 --> 00:41:02,963
-正确的。 -从头开始。
- Right. - From the top.

706
00:41:03,998 --> 00:41:06,166
7:07，红毯结束。
7:07, red carpet ends.

707
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:09,737
好的，7点09分，我们中的一个人穿过大厅进入，打扮成服务员。
Okay, 7:09, one of us enters through the lobby, dressed as a server.

708
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:13,541
- 7:25，拍卖开始。 -七点半，我们熄灯。
- 7:25, the auction begins. - 7:30, we cut the lights.

709
00:41:13,574 --> 00:41:15,775
7点31分，抓拍开始。
7:31, the snatch goes down.

710
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:17,744
7点32分，我们在逃跑的车上集合。
7:32, we all meet at the getaway car.

711
00:41:17,777 --> 00:41:20,715
到7点33分，我们都死了
And by 7:33, we're all dead

712
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:23,818
或者富得流油。
or rich as fuck.

713
00:41:25,052 --> 00:41:26,554
他妈的是的。
Fuck yeah.

714
00:41:26,586 --> 00:41:28,521
现在我们要决定的最后一件事，
Now the last thing we have to decide,

715
00:41:29,657 --> 00:41:31,490
我们谁去抢?
which one of us makes the grab?

716
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,630
<i>好的，迈克。</i>
<i>All right, Mike.</i>

717
00:41:37,664 --> 00:41:38,965
你是第一个。 我们走吧。
You're first up. Let's go.

718
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,802
好吧。
All right.

719
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:43,070
在你身上。 好了。
On you. Here we go.

720
00:41:48,242 --> 00:41:49,844
快，快，快，快，快。
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

721
00:41:56,317 --> 00:41:57,952
不。
No.

722
00:41:57,985 --> 00:42:01,088
-怎么样? -不，太可怕了。 一次。
- How was that? - No, horrible. Again.

723
00:42:01,121 --> 00:42:03,157
你一抢它，警报器就会响。
Alarm will sound as soon as you snatch it.

724
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,326
你有30秒的时间去找逃跑的车。
You got 30 seconds to get to the getaway car.

725
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:08,329
如果这是真实的表面，情况就不一样了。
Well, if this was real surface, things would be different.

726
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:10,331
是啊，真的。
Yeah, no shit.

727
00:42:10,364 --> 00:42:13,034
如果你能在这里执行，你就没有理由在当天把事情搞砸。
If you can execute here, you have no excuse to screw it up on the day.

728
00:42:13,067 --> 00:42:14,135
好吧。 我们走吧。
All right. Let's go.

729
00:42:23,043 --> 00:42:24,311
好了。
Nice.

730
00:42:24,344 --> 00:42:25,980
走，走，走，走。
Go, go, go, go.

731
00:42:35,889 --> 00:42:37,891
-没有。 -什么?
- No. - Nothing?

732
00:42:37,925 --> 00:42:39,793
不。 还差得远呢。
No. Not even close.

733
00:42:39,827 --> 00:42:42,063
-好了，让开。 我醒来了。 -来吧。
- All right, move aside. I'm up. - Come on.

734
00:42:44,697 --> 00:42:45,733
好了，准备好了吗?
All right, ready?

735
00:42:49,003 --> 00:42:50,838
走吧!是啊!
Go! Yeah!

736
00:42:50,871 --> 00:42:53,606
快点，快点，快点，快点。 过来拿吧。
Come on, come on, come on, come on. Come and get it.

737
00:42:53,641 --> 00:42:55,376
走到拐角处。 快，快，快，快，快。
Hit the corner. Go, go, go, go, go, go.

738
00:42:55,409 --> 00:42:57,378
噢! 噢,他妈的!
Ow! Ow, fuck!

739
00:42:57,411 --> 00:42:59,012
走，走，走，走，走。
Go, go, go, go, go.

740
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,217
啊。
Ugh.

741
00:43:04,251 --> 00:43:05,286
不。 时间。
No. Time.

742
00:43:05,318 --> 00:43:07,387
我们得搞定这个，迈克!
We gotta get this. Mike!

743
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,856
来吧! 好的。 深呼吸。
Come on! All right. Take a breath.

744
00:43:10,858 --> 00:43:11,958
准备好了吗? ,走吧!
Ready? And go!

745
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:18,264
快，快，快，快。 走，走，走，走。
Come on, come on, come on, come. Go, go, go, go.

746
00:43:23,804 --> 00:43:25,338
来吧。
Come on.

747
00:43:25,371 --> 00:43:26,873
时间。
Time.

748
00:43:26,907 --> 00:43:28,074
啊!
Ugh!

749
00:43:28,108 --> 00:43:29,643
怎么样?
How was that?

750
00:43:30,311 --> 00:43:31,378
不。
No.

751
00:43:31,411 --> 00:43:32,947
神。
God.

752
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,248
我们得搞定这个。
We gotta get this.

753
00:43:37,251 --> 00:43:38,385
你起来。
You're up.

754
00:43:38,418 --> 00:43:41,054
好的。 我以为你不会问。
Okay. Thought you'd never ask.

755
00:43:41,088 --> 00:43:42,222
很快。
Quickly.

756
00:43:47,427 --> 00:43:48,695
我们受骗的。
We're fucked.

757
00:43:50,331 --> 00:43:52,199
准备好了吗?准备好了。
Ready? Ready.

758
00:43:52,233 --> 00:43:53,266
走了。
Go.

759
00:44:08,282 --> 00:44:10,717
哇,哇。 希望…
Whoa, whoa. Hopefully...

760
00:44:13,387 --> 00:44:14,855
我做得怎么样?
How'd I do?

761
00:44:14,889 --> 00:44:15,989
你是怎么做到的?
How did you do that?

762
00:44:16,023 --> 00:44:18,125
预测转弯。
Anticipate the turns.

763
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:20,226
你是对的。 我们人手太多了。
You're right. We got too much muscle.

764
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:21,896
好吧，没人这么说过。
Okay, nobody ever said that.

765
00:44:23,797 --> 00:44:27,934
-你准备好了吗? -是的。 是的。
- You think you're up for this? - Yeah. Yeah.

766
00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:30,070
好的。
Okay.

767
00:44:30,103 --> 00:44:31,070
前面。
All right. Okay.

768
00:44:31,105 --> 00:44:32,739
集。
Set.

769
00:44:32,773 --> 00:44:34,074
蒙上眼睛。
Do it blindfolded.

770
00:45:19,853 --> 00:45:21,322
我们的拍卖马上就要开始了。
Our auction will begin shortly.

771
00:45:21,355 --> 00:45:23,958
请开始找你们的座位。
Please start to find your way to your seats.

772
00:45:31,831 --> 00:45:34,168
我看起来怎么样?
How do I look?

773
00:45:34,201 --> 00:45:36,436
就像汤姆·克鲁斯想要回他的面具一样。
Like Tom Cruise wants his mask back.

774
00:45:36,469 --> 00:45:38,038
我们就这么办吧。 我们走吧。
Let's go with that. Let's go.

775
00:45:49,983 --> 00:45:52,452
拍卖两分钟后开始。 两分钟。
The auction will begin in two minutes. Two minutes.

776
00:45:52,485 --> 00:45:54,221
请各位就座。
Please, everyone, take your seats.

777
00:47:14,101 --> 00:47:16,538
女士们，先生们，欢迎你们。 我是麦克斯韦·怀亚特。
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I am Maxwell Wyatt.

778
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:19,306
今晚，你可能会带着一段体育历史回家。
Tonight, you may walk home with a piece of sports history.

779
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:21,240
话不多说，我们的第一项。
Without further ado, our first item.

780
00:47:21,275 --> 00:47:22,577
1000年,1000年。
1,000, 1,000.

781
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:24,311
为10000。
For 10,000.

782
00:47:24,344 --> 00:47:25,878
10000美元。
$10,000.

783
00:47:25,913 --> 00:47:27,414
我有两万五千美元吗?
Do I have $25,000?

784
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:31,217
那他妈是谁?
Who the fuck is that?

785
00:48:00,213 --> 00:48:01,315
我们看起来怎么样?
How are we lookin'?

786
00:48:01,347 --> 00:48:03,384
我他妈太棒了。
I am fan-fucking-tastic.

787
00:48:03,416 --> 00:48:05,519
闭嘴，让我工作。
Now shut up and let me do my job.

788
00:48:05,552 --> 00:48:08,021
<i>复制。 </i>谢谢。
<i>Copy.</i> Thank you.

789
00:48:08,054 --> 00:48:09,155
耶稣。
Jesus.

790
00:48:10,123 --> 00:48:12,259
嘿，我只是想做一些…
Hey, I was actually just looking to make some...

791
00:48:12,291 --> 00:48:14,260
闭上嘴，转过身去。
Shut your mouth and turn around.

792
00:48:14,293 --> 00:48:15,530
把手举到我能看见的地方。
Hands where I can see 'em.

793
00:48:15,563 --> 00:48:16,597
好的。
Okay.

794
00:48:18,331 --> 00:48:20,199
纽约警察局。 你被捕了。
NYPD. You're under arrest.

795
00:48:20,233 --> 00:48:22,034
是的，东翼，我们发生了一起派对事故…
Yeah, east wing, we got a party crash...

796
00:48:34,081 --> 00:48:39,219
罗兹，迈克，这地方到处都是卧底警察。
Rhodes, Mike, this place is crowded with undercover cops.

797
00:48:40,286 --> 00:48:42,891
他们可能只是兼职保安，对吧?
Ah, they're probably just moonlighting as security, right?

798
00:48:43,891 --> 00:48:47,193
来这里领取现金和海鲜自助餐。
Here for the cash handout and seafood buffet.

799
00:48:47,226 --> 00:48:48,461
按计划进行。
Proceed as planned.

800
00:49:10,585 --> 00:49:12,719
嘿,漂亮。 真没想到在这儿见到你。
Hey, gorgeous. Fancy seeing you here.

801
00:49:12,753 --> 00:49:15,690
我能为您效劳吗? 哦，别耍花招了。 没人能听到我们。
Can I help you? Oh, cut the charade. Nobody can hear us.

802
00:49:15,722 --> 00:49:18,559
大任务进行得怎么样了? 准备好大干一场了吗?
So how's the big mission going? You ready to make the big swipe, huh?

803
00:49:18,592 --> 00:49:20,427
好吧，动动脑子。
Okay, use your head.

804
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,028
以后会有人认出我们的。
Someone could ID us later on.

805
00:49:22,061 --> 00:49:24,063
瞧，这就是我喜欢你的原因，赛克斯。
See, that's why I like you, Sykes.

806
00:49:24,097 --> 00:49:26,233
你有多性感，就有多聪明。
You're as smart as you're hot.

807
00:49:26,266 --> 00:49:28,001
我们找个小角落怎么样
How about we find a little corner somewhere

808
00:49:28,034 --> 00:49:30,369
我们可以，呃，你知道的，谈一谈?
and we can, uh, you know, have a little talk?

809
00:49:30,403 --> 00:49:32,438
好吧，我们来偷那张卡。
Okay, we're here to steal that card.

810
00:49:32,472 --> 00:49:34,509
我知道。 在大动作之前先做点小动作

00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:28,208
我要举报你。
I'm going to report you.

947
00:58:51,632 --> 00:58:52,800
你很好。
You're fine.

948
00:58:58,105 --> 00:59:00,740
他妈的,人。 我们得回去救她。
Fuck, man. We gotta go back and get her.

949
00:59:01,742 --> 00:59:03,344
我要给温娜打电话，好吗?
I'm gonna call Winna. Okay?

950
00:59:03,376 --> 00:59:05,311
警察在他的口袋里。 他知道该怎么做。
He's got cops in his pockets. He'll know what to do.

951
00:59:05,346 --> 00:59:07,815
Winna只关心他自己。 他才不在乎我们呢。
Winna only cares about himself. He doesn't give a fuck about us.

952
00:59:07,847 --> 00:59:10,951
完全正确。 对我们有利的事对所有人都有利。
Exactly. What's good for us is good for everybody.

953
00:59:10,985 --> 00:59:14,789
赛克斯不会出卖我们的。 嘿，你知道的。 对吧?
Sykes isn't gonna give us up. Hey, you know that. Right?

954
00:59:14,822 --> 00:59:17,791
让她自由对大家都好。
It's in everybody's best interest to get her free.

955
00:59:17,824 --> 00:59:21,228
现在，翻盘子，烧掉所有东西，按计划行事，宝贝。
Now, flip the plates, burn everything, stick to the fucking plan, baby.

956
00:59:21,262 --> 00:59:22,862
我们走吧。 你说对了。
Let's go. You got it.

957
00:59:28,302 --> 00:59:31,038
嘿，凯西，我的朋友。 你好吗? </i>
<i>Hey, Casey, my friend. How you doing?</i>

958
00:59:31,072 --> 00:59:33,173
嘿，在你开口之前，不要，好吗?
Hey, before you say anything, no, okay?

959
00:59:33,206 --> 00:59:34,742
赛克斯不会出卖我们的。
Sykes isn't gonna give us up.

960
00:59:34,775 --> 00:59:36,844
你确定吗? </i>
<i>Are you sure about that?</i>

961
00:59:36,876 --> 00:59:38,344
这他妈是什么意思?
The fuck is that supposed to mean?

962
00:59:38,378 --> 00:59:40,780
<i>意思是我在系统里有人。 </i>是的。
<i>It means I got people in the system.</i> Yeah.

963
00:59:40,815 --> 00:59:43,918
<i>不要问。 如果你认为她会成为一个麻烦，就直说了
<i>Don't ask. If you think she's gonna be a problem, just say so.</i>

964
00:59:43,951 --> 00:59:45,351
<i>我可以让她不。</i>
<i>I can make it so she ain't.</i>

965
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:48,856
不，不，好吗? 她是团队的一员。
No, no, okay? She's part of the team.

966
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:50,757
听着，好吧，我明白了。 你是对的。 好。</i>
<i>Look, okay, I get it. You're right. Fine.</i>

967
00:59:50,791 --> 00:59:52,358
忘了我说过的话，好吗? </i>
<i>Just forget anything I said, all right?</i>

968
00:59:52,393 --> 00:59:55,728
<i>听着，好消息，我们拿到卡了
<i>Listen, good news, we got the card.</i>

969
00:59:55,762 --> 00:59:58,731
但坏消息是，赛克斯把它交给了我
<i>But bad news is, well, Sykes handed it off to me,</i>

970
00:59:58,766 --> 01:00:00,800
<i>这是聪明的时刻。</i>
<i>which was smart in the moment.</i>

971
01:00:00,835 --> 01:00:03,637
<i>但是为了自己逃出去，我有点不得不把它交给一个警察
<i>But to get out myself, I kind of had to pass it off to a cop.</i>

972
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:05,840
<i>现在，我不知道这个警察在哪里
<i>And now, I have no idea where this cop is.</i>

973
01:00:05,873 --> 01:00:08,842
但是不要担心那个。 一切都好。 一切都会好起来的。</i>
<i>But don't worry about that. All is well. All will be well.</i>

974
01:00:08,876 --> 01:00:11,311
<i>我们只要找到他就能拿到卡
<i>We'll just track him down and we'll get the card.</i>

975
01:00:11,344 --> 01:00:13,012
喂?
Hello?

976
01:00:13,047 --> 01:00:15,081
<i>我们将会变得富有，我的朋友
<i>We are going to be rich, my friend.</i>

977
01:00:15,115 --> 01:00:18,418
我告诉过你，我会支持你的。 你没有什么好担心的。</i>
<i>I told you, I got your back. You have nothing to worry about.</i>

978
01:00:18,452 --> 01:00:21,856
生活是美好的。 我们在世界之巅。 我很快就会和你通话
<i>Life is good. We're on top of the world. I will speak to you soon.</i>

979
01:00:22,356 --> 01:00:23,389
喂?
Hello?

980
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,329
好的。 听起来不错。
All right. Sounds good.

981
01:00:31,132 --> 01:00:32,166
喂!
Ho!

982
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,635
嗨,迈克!
Hey, Mike!

983
01:00:41,842 --> 01:00:42,909
哇!
Whoo!

01:00:45,746 --> 01:00:47,447
你,迈克。
Yo, Mike.

985
01:00:47,481 --> 01:00:48,715
这他妈是什么?
What the fuck is that?

986
01:00:52,485 --> 01:00:53,887
情况下!
Case!

987
01:00:54,954 --> 01:00:55,889
他妈的!
Fuck!

988
01:01:17,077 --> 01:01:18,077
他妈的。
Fuck.

989
01:01:34,295 --> 01:01:35,762
嗯。
Uh-uh.

990
01:02:06,159 --> 01:02:07,293
死的!
Die!

991
01:02:34,454 --> 01:02:38,092
好吧，你没子弹了。 这应该会很有趣。
Okay, you're out of ammo. This should be some fun.

992
01:02:44,599 --> 01:02:45,965
嗨,迈克!
Hey, Mike!

993
01:02:47,233 --> 01:02:49,369
迈克!
Mike!

994
01:02:52,972 --> 01:02:54,240
你没事吧，伙计?
You all right, buddy?

995
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:59,346
你个混蛋。
You fucking piece of shit.

996
01:03:02,949 --> 01:03:04,150
我认识这个人。
Yo, I know this guy.

997
01:03:06,853 --> 01:03:08,355
他是温娜的保安。
He's security for Winna.

998
01:03:10,157 --> 01:03:11,224
哟,米奇?
Yo, Mikey?

999
01:03:16,329 --> 01:03:17,364
你没事吧?
You okay?

1000
01:03:18,164 --> 01:03:20,099
我送你去医院，好吗?
I'll get you to the hospital, all right?

1001
01:03:20,134 --> 01:03:21,367
好了，麦奇，听着。
Okay, Mikey, look.

1002
01:03:22,637 --> 01:03:24,003
嗨,米奇。
Hey, Mikey.

1003
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:26,373
嗨,迈克! 迈克!
Hey, Mike! Mike!

1004
01:03:27,106 --> 01:03:29,009
嘿，伙计，你没事的。 你是好的。
Hey, buddy, you're okay. You're okay.

1005
01:03:29,043 --> 01:03:32,079
嘿，看着我。 看着我。 你没事的，伙计。
Hey, look at me. Look at me. You're all right, buddy.

1006
01:03:32,112 --> 01:03:35,583
我们会送你去医院的 你会没事的。
We're gonna get you to the hospital. You're gonna be all right.

1007
01:03:35,617 --> 01:03:37,083
嗨,米奇。
Hey, Mikey.

1008
01:03:37,619 --> 01:03:40,219
哦,他妈的。 迈克!
Oh, fuck. Mike!

1009
01:04:34,041 --> 01:04:35,309
你以为你在这里? </i>
<i>You think you're here?</i>

1010
01:04:46,353 --> 01:04:48,322
来吧，接电话。 捡起。
Come on, pick up. Pick up.

1011
01:04:49,657 --> 01:04:50,692
嗨。
Hi.

1012
01:04:50,724 --> 01:04:53,360
嘿,宝贝。<i>嗨。 嗨。</i>
Hey, baby. <i>Hi. Hi.</i>

1013
01:04:53,393 --> 01:04:56,630
莉莉，我要你离开家，接克拉拉去酒店。
Lily, I need you to leave the house, get Clara and get to a hotel.

1014
01:04:56,664 --> 01:04:58,565
<i> ? 是什么… 什么…</i>
<i>What? What is... What...</i>

1015
01:04:58,599 --> 01:05:00,967
凯西，你在说什么? </i>事情搞砸了。
<i>Casey, what are you talking about?</i> Something fucked-up happened.

1016
01:05:01,001 --> 01:05:03,170
你做了什么? </i>不，不，不，不。 不，不，不。
<i>What did you do?</i> No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

1017
01:05:03,202 --> 01:05:05,338
我要你马上离开家，好吗?
Hey, I need you to leave the house right now, okay?

1018
01:05:05,371 --> 01:05:07,474
你做了什么，凯西? </i>我没有时间解释。
<i>What did you do, Casey?</i> I don't have time to explain.

1019
01:05:07,509 --> 01:05:09,376
离开家吧，天啊! 我简直不敢相信。</ I >
Just leave the house. <i>Jesus! I can't believe it.</i>

1020
01:05:09,409 --> 01:05:11,311
你伤害别人了吗? </i>不，不是那个。
<i>Did you hurt someone?</i> No, it's not that.

1021
01:05:11,344 --> 01:05:14,681
离开家，莉莉! 走吧!
Leave the house, Lily! Go!

1022
01:05:15,682 --> 01:05:17,050
地狱…
Hell...

1023
01:05:19,452 --> 01:05:20,588
上帝!
God!

1024
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:23,389
他妈的。 他妈的。
Fuck. Fuck.

1025
01:05:31,063 --> 01:05:32,634
美世。
Mercer.

1026
01:05:32,666 --> 01:05:36,202
罗兹。 我需要见个面。
It's Rhodes. I need to meet.

1027
01:05:41,509 --> 01:05:42,943
我们得谈谈。
We need to talk.

1028
01:05:54,789 --> 01:05:57,990
所以，从头开始。 骑士肮脏吗?
So, from the top. Is Knight dirty?

1029
01:05:58,025 --> 01:06:00,193
我不知道。 也许吧。
I don't know. Maybe.

1030
01:06:00,226 --> 01:06:03,230
我们认为温娜和这些抢劫有关吗?
We think Winna's involved in these heists?

1031
01:06:03,262 --> 01:06:05,599
他在那里不是巧合。
Well, it's not a coincidence that he was there.

1032
01:06:08,101 --> 01:06:10,505
奈特帮温娜解决了多少案子?
How many cases has Knight tanked for Winna?

1033
01:06:13,072 --> 01:06:14,675
老实说,没有。
Honestly, none.

1034
01:06:16,476 --> 01:06:18,579
我觉得这只是一个
I think it was just a case of

1035
01:06:18,612 --> 01:06:20,782
"睁一只眼闭一只眼"的情况，你知道吗?
"Looking the other way" situation, you know?

1036
01:06:20,815 --> 01:06:24,719
但奈特从不让任何事情溜走。
But Knight doesn't let anything slide, ever.

1037
01:06:24,751 --> 01:06:26,487
他太骄傲了。
He's too proud.

1038
01:06:31,291 --> 01:06:32,326
菲茨杰拉德。
Fitzgerald.

1039
01:06:32,793 --> 01:06:34,027
谁?
Who?

1040
01:06:35,496 --> 01:06:38,632
他的伙伴。 被罗兹射杀的那个。
His partner. The one who got shot by Rhodes.

1041
01:06:39,666 --> 01:06:42,603
我打赌温娜威胁过他。
Bet you Winna threatened his life.

1042
01:06:42,637 --> 01:06:44,304
这就解释了。
That explains it.

1043
01:06:44,338 --> 01:06:46,641
一个坏人说他会伤害他的朋友?
A bad guy said he'd hurt his friend?

1044
01:06:46,673 --> 01:06:48,543
他是一个警察。
He is a cop.

1045
01:06:48,576 --> 01:06:51,277
他知道不能让一个人离开抢劫现场。
He knows better than to let a perp leave the scene of a heist.

1046
01:06:51,311 --> 01:06:53,213
而且不是一般的罪犯。
And not just any perp.

1047
01:06:53,246 --> 01:06:57,416
都在处理温娜的案子。
All have open cases on Winna.

1048
01:06:57,451 --> 01:06:59,721
他是个又黏又有钱的混蛋。
He's a slimy, rich asshole bastard.

1049
01:06:59,753 --> 01:07:03,056
他一直在逃避每一项调查，挥金如土。
He's been sliding out of each and every investigation, throwing his money around.

1050
01:07:03,090 --> 01:07:05,559
他是这座城市的罪魁祸首。
He is the cause of what's wrong with this city.

1051
01:07:05,592 --> 01:07:09,630
他甚至曾经是一名CI，并发挥力量消除他的对手。
He even used to be a CI and played the force to eliminate his rivals.

1052
01:07:09,664 --> 01:07:11,364
你以为我们不知道温娜的事吗?
You think we don't know about Winna?

1053
01:07:11,398 --> 01:07:13,065
我们跟着他好多年了!
We have been on his ass for years!

1054
01:07:13,099 --> 01:07:15,469
还有两个拉克的警察进来了
And two city cops from LA walk in here

1055
01:07:15,503 --> 01:07:17,237
以为他们能处理好这破事，
and think they're gonna handle this shit,

1056
01:07:17,271 --> 01:07:19,239
搞砸整个案子?
fuckin' up the whole entire case?

1057
01:07:20,507 --> 01:07:22,577
那个女人，她说什么了?
The woman, she said something?

1058
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:25,679
什么都别说，听着。
Not a word. Listen.

1059
01:07:27,614 --> 01:07:30,083
我能让她开口。 给我五分钟。
I can get her to speak. Give me five minutes.

1060
01:07:30,117 --> 01:07:32,820
幸运的是你不在她旁边的牢房里。
Be lucky you are not in the cell next to her.

1061
01:07:32,853 --> 01:07:36,389
如果奈特跟这案子或温娜扯上关系，
Knight goes anywhere near this case or Winna,

1062
01:07:36,422 --> 01:07:38,291
我要把他关在牢里这么久
I will have him in a cell so long

1063
01:07:38,324 --> 01:07:40,159
它会把你的脑袋割下来。
it will rot his fucking head off.

1064
01:07:42,563 --> 01:07:43,697
滚出我的办公室。
Get out of my office.

1065
01:08:09,523 --> 01:08:12,358
你现在真他妈丢脸。 你不应该得到这个徽章
<i>You're a fucking disgrace now. You don't deserve this badge.</i>

1066
01:08:13,827 --> 01:08:17,430
那里肯定出了什么事。 他抓住了你的把柄
<i>Something is going on there. He's got something on you.</i>

1067
01:09:53,994 --> 01:09:56,631
<i>嘿，这是你最喜欢的CIWinna
<i>Hey, it's your favorite CI Winna.</i>

1068
01:09:56,663 --> 01:09:59,432
只是想让你知道，leachi随时会来
<i>Just letting you know, Leach will be coming by any second.</i>

1069
01:09:59,466 --> 01:10:02,636
还有，别忘了，警探，你欠我的
<i>And, uh, don't forget, Detective, you owe me.</i>

1070
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,836
我最喜欢的侦探怎么样了? </i>
<i>How's my favorite detective?</i>

1071
01:10:34,868 --> 01:10:36,671
是啊，关你什么事?
Yeah, what's it to you?

1072
01:10:36,703 --> 01:10:39,439
哦，我们见面吧。
Oh, let's meet.

1073
01:10:39,472 --> 01:10:41,542
我想我们应该见个面。
I think we should meet.

1074
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:35,563
-嘿，宝贝。 <i>-嗨，凯西。</i>
- Hey, baby. <i>- Hi, Casey.</i>

1075
01:11:35,595 --> 01:11:36,898
你们在酒店吗?
You guys at the hotel?

1076
01:11:37,631 --> 01:11:39,734
<i>哦,不。</i>
<i>Uh, no.</i>

1077
01:11:39,766 --> 01:11:41,836
你是什么意思? <i>我们不在旅馆。</i>
What do you mean? <i>We're not at the hotel.</i>

1078
01:11:41,868 --> 01:11:44,939
不，不，不。 嘿,没有。 不。 我需要你… 我需要你相信我。
No, no, no, no. Hey, no. No. I need you... I need you to trust me.

1079
01:11:44,971 --> 01:11:46,940
这太疯狂了。 宝贝，我需要你相信我。
<i>This is insane.</i> Baby, I need you to trust me.

1080
01:11:46,974 --> 01:11:49,976
我要你收拾好你的东西，带上克拉拉，马上去酒店。
I need you to get your shit, get Clara and get to a hotel right now.

1081
01:11:50,011 --> 01:11:51,912
<i>不，我不想那样做。</i>不!
<i>No, I don't want to do that.</i> No!

1082
01:11:51,945 --> 01:11:54,015
你太多疑了。 </i>不，我不是。 我向你保证。
<i>You're being paranoid.</i> No, I'm not. I promise you.

1083
01:11:54,047 --> 01:11:56,448
你太多疑了。 </i>我不是多疑，好吗?
<i>You are being paranoid.</i> I'm not being paranoid, okay?

1084
01:11:56,483 --> 01:11:58,853
人们在追我。 你不安全。
People are after me. You're not safe.

1085
01:11:58,886 --> 01:12:02,122
你不安全。 好吧，我觉得很安全。 我不… 我受够了。 我完成了。< / I >
You're not safe. <i>Well, I feel safe. And I don't... I'm over this. I'm done.</i>

1086
01:12:02,155 --> 01:12:03,890
你… 他妈的。
You... Fuck.

1087
01:12:11,731 --> 01:12:13,000
哦,他妈的。
Oh, fuck.

1088
01:12:17,971 --> 01:12:19,606
哦,他妈的。
Oh, fuck.

1089
01:12:27,081 --> 01:12:28,615
啊,操。
Ah, fuck.

1090
01:12:28,649 --> 01:12:31,018
他妈的。
Fuck.

1091
01:12:37,859 --> 01:12:39,894
他们射杀了迈克。
They shot Mike.

1092
01:12:39,926 --> 01:12:43,430
赛克斯被关在某个地方，伙计。 这简直太操蛋了。
And Sykes is locked up somewhere, man. It's absolutely fucked.

1093
01:12:44,463 --> 01:12:46,567
嗯，嗯，嗯。
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

1094
01:12:47,466 --> 01:12:48,502
嗯?
Hmm?

1095
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:51,404
你能试着有点同情心吗?
Can you try to have a heart?

1096
01:12:51,438 --> 01:12:52,974
我在这里，不是吗?
I'm here, aren't I?

1097
01:12:53,006 --> 01:12:54,942
我是说，这可是个好消息。
I mean, there, that's some good news.

1098
01:12:56,042 --> 01:12:58,979
老兄，你对"好"的定义一直很烂。
Man, you've always had a fucked-up definition of good.

1099
01:13:02,448 --> 01:13:04,719
伙计，如果你感觉到了热度，就…
Man, if you're feeling the heat, get...

1100
01:13:04,752 --> 01:13:06,186
你知道，去墨西哥什么的。
You know, go to Mexico or something.

1101
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:08,189
墨西哥，然后呢?
Mexico, and then what?

1102
01:13:08,221 --> 01:13:09,789
嗯,生活。
Well, live.

1103
01:13:09,823 --> 01:13:11,958
是免费的。 而不是去坐牢。
Be free. Not go to fucking jail.

1104
01:13:12,693 --> 01:13:15,162
温娜想要杀了我，伙计。
Winna tried to wipe me out, man.

1105
01:13:20,201 --> 01:13:21,601
你身上带东西了吗?
You have anything on you?

1106
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:24,505
耶稣的人。
Jesus, man.

1107
01:13:25,605 --> 01:13:27,807
慢点，伙计。
Just slow down, buddy.

1108
01:13:38,484 --> 01:13:40,453
你感觉好点了吗?
Do you feel better?

1109
01:13:40,487 --> 01:13:41,521
好的。
Okay.

1110
01:13:42,722 --> 01:13:44,891
好吧，那怎么办?
All right, so what's the play?

1111
01:13:47,929 --> 01:13:50,931
我不死，薇娜是不会罢休的。
Well, Winna's not gonna stop until I'm dead.

1112
01:13:51,966 --> 01:13:53,900
可能。
Probably.

1113
01:13:53,935 --> 01:13:56,469
所以我得想办法接近他。
So I gotta figure out a way to get close to him.

1114
01:13:57,637 --> 01:13:58,905
然后呢?
And then what?

1115
01:13:58,939 --> 01:14:00,541
你他妈以为呢?
The fuck you think?

1116
01:14:01,408 --> 01:14:04,078
不，别这样，兄弟。 你他妈不是杀手。
No, come on, bro. You're not a fucking killer.

1117
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:07,014
自从你杀了那个警察你就一直是个脾气暴躁的小贱人。
You've been a grumpy little bitch ever since you shot that cop.

1118
01:14:07,047 --> 01:14:08,215
去你妈的。
Man, fuck you.

1119
01:14:10,551 --> 01:14:12,953
老兄，这可是预谋谋杀。
Man, you're talking about premeditated murder.

1120
01:14:13,753 --> 01:14:17,123
而不是这种毛茸茸的自卫玩意儿。
Not this fluffy little self-defense shit.

1121
01:14:17,158 --> 01:14:20,226
你得走到他面前，拿枪指着他的头
You got to walk up to him, put a gun to his fucking head

1122
01:14:20,261 --> 01:14:21,796
然后扣动扳机。
and pull the trigger.

1123
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:25,099
别这样，凯西，你不是那种人。
Come on, Casey, you're not that guy.

1124
01:14:31,072 --> 01:14:32,974
我知道怎么接近他了。
I know how we can get close to him.

1125
01:14:35,710 --> 01:14:38,212
卡在一个警察的桌子里，对吧?
The card is in a cop's desk, right?

1126
01:14:39,079 --> 01:14:41,082
所以，我们偷偷溜进…
So, we sneak into...

1127
01:14:43,184 --> 01:14:44,819
偷偷地…
Sneak...

1128
01:14:46,119 --> 01:14:48,555
我们只要溜进警察局就行了。
We just gotta sneak into a police station.

1129
01:14:50,056 --> 01:14:51,192
他妈的,对吧。
Fuck, right.

1130
01:14:53,094 --> 01:14:54,929
不不不不不。
No, no, no, no, no.

1131
01:14:55,563 --> 01:14:56,963
我们中的一个可以。
One of us can.

1132
01:14:56,997 --> 01:15:00,067
我们中的一个可以。 好吗?
One of us can. Okay?

1133
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:02,603
就像橄榄球比赛一样，兄弟。
Just like a fucking football play, brother.

1134
01:15:02,636 --> 01:15:04,604
我假装左边，你假装右边。
I fucking fake left, you go right.

1135
01:15:06,873 --> 01:15:11,078
你说我愿意，我就照做。
You say I do, I'll fucking do it.

1136
01:15:11,112 --> 01:15:14,814
哥们，我不能让你… 我不能要求你这么做。 我是说，拜托。
Dude, I can't let you... I can't ask you to do that. I mean, come on.

1137
01:15:14,849 --> 01:15:17,083
我来分散他们的注意力，让警察跟着我。
I'll create a diversion, get the cops to follow me.

1138
01:15:17,118 --> 01:15:19,619
你要做的就是想办法进去。
All you gotta do is find a way to get in there.

1139
01:15:19,653 --> 01:15:21,622
你猜怎么着，宝贝? 这他妈的是万圣节。
And guess what, baby? It's fucking Halloween.

1140
01:15:23,123 --> 01:15:24,725
这是万圣节。
It is Halloween.

1141
01:15:25,859 --> 01:15:28,561
一年有一次，你可以在任何地方戴口罩。
One time a year you can wear a mask anywhere you want.

1142
01:15:30,197 --> 01:15:31,265
不…
No...

1143
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:34,534
有创意。
Get creative.

1144
01:15:36,103 --> 01:15:37,938
会很有趣的。
It'd be fun.

1145
01:16:29,323 --> 01:16:30,890
嘿!
Hey!

1146
01:16:32,359 --> 01:16:33,594
有什么事吗?
What's up?

1147
01:16:34,028 --> 01:16:35,229
耶稣基督。
Jesus Christ.

1148
01:16:36,197 --> 01:16:39,132
那些苏格兰爱尔兰人现在对你怎么样了?
How are those Scots-Irish genes treating you now?

1149
01:16:40,868 --> 01:16:44,037
比英国人还糟糕。
Worse than the English. Yeah.

1150
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:46,073
你把我吵醒了。
You woke me up.

1151
01:16:48,341 --> 01:16:50,211
好了，来吧，伙计。
All right, come on, pal.

1152
01:16:52,412 --> 01:16:54,614
还在下雨，不是吗?
It's still raining, isn't it?

1153
01:17:00,753 --> 01:17:04,158
我都快想疯了。
I'm losing my mind trying to figure this out.

1154
01:17:04,958 --> 01:17:06,060
尼基赛克斯。
Nikki Sykes.

1155
01:17:06,793 --> 01:17:08,261
Ex-Olympic体操运动员。
Ex-Olympic gymnast.

1156
01:17:09,063 --> 01:17:11,030
在里约热内卢获得第四名。
Finished fourth at Rio.

1157
01:17:11,064 --> 01:17:14,201
然后她就被终身禁赛了。
And then she got banned for life from the sport.

1158
01:17:14,234 --> 01:17:15,668
因为得了第四名?
For coming in fourth?

1159
01:17:15,703 --> 01:17:17,238
不。
No.

1160
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:20,207
因为她出售奥运队友的医疗记录
For selling medical records of her fellow Olympians.

1161
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:22,208
他们无法证明。
They couldn't prove it.

1162
01:17:22,243 --> 01:17:25,279
显然，买家是一个据称为…
Apparently, the buyer is a guy who allegedly worked for...

1163
01:17:25,311 --> 01:17:26,846
让我猜猜。
Let me guess.

1164
01:17:27,881 --> 01:17:29,350
Winna。
Winna.

1165
01:17:29,382 --> 01:17:31,252
这是right.Mm-hmm。
That's right. Mm-hmm.

1166
01:17:31,284 --> 01:17:33,988
赛克斯什么都没说。
Sykes hasn't said a word.

1167
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:37,992
但如今，元数据电话完成了所有的通话。
But these days, the metadata on phones do all the talking.

1168
01:17:38,024 --> 01:17:44,131
所以我找了个国安局的哥们，监听她的手机。
So I got a buddy of mine at NSA, you know, to QTap her phone.

1169
01:17:44,164 --> 01:17:46,065
只是想看看是什么样的朋友
Just to see what kind of cluster of friends

1170
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:48,668
她一直在和人聊天。
she's chatting with consistently.

1171
01:17:49,170 --> 01:17:50,337
还有谁?
Who else?

1172
01:17:50,371 --> 01:17:52,238
迈克罗彻斯特。
Mike Rochester.

1173
01:17:52,273 --> 01:17:55,009
和罗兹上的是同一所大学，还被大都会队选中。
Went to the same college as Rhodes and got drafted by the Mets.

1174
01:17:55,042 --> 01:17:56,342
嗯哼。
Mm-hmm.

1175
01:17:56,377 --> 01:17:58,145
然后只玩了一年，因为…
And then only played for one year, because...

1176
01:17:58,179 --> 01:18:01,282
嗯哼… 他聚会太多了。 他们开除了他。
Mm-hmm... he was partying too much. They cut him.

1177
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:04,818
他现在死了。
Well, he's dead now.

1178
01:18:04,851 --> 01:18:09,456
他们在他叔叔的垃圾场发现了他的尸体。 哦。
They found his body in his uncle's junkyard. Oh.

1179
01:18:09,489 --> 01:18:12,859
我猜罗兹想少分点。
I guess Rhodes wanted one less share to go around.

1180
01:18:12,893 --> 01:18:14,228
是啊，没追踪到。
Yeah, that doesn't track.

1181
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:22,168
他们不会丢下任何人的。
They're not gonna leave anybody behind.

1182
01:18:23,804 --> 01:18:25,072
如果是温娜呢?
What if it was Winna?

1183
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:27,841
他知道热浪正向他袭来，
He knows heat is coming his way,

1184
01:18:27,875 --> 01:18:31,177
所以他想收买他们，却搞砸了。
so he tried to merc them, but screws the hit.

1185
01:18:33,314 --> 01:18:37,384
他知道梅塞兰·罗德斯不会乖乖走的。
He-He knows that Mercer and Rhodes won't go quietly.

1186
01:18:38,819 --> 01:18:40,787
几率相当高。
Odds are pretty good.

1187
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:43,390
我是说，他们宁愿死也不愿进监狱。
I mean, they'll choose death before they go to prison.

1188
01:18:43,423 --> 01:18:46,159
嗯哼。 我想这是温娜会接受的教唆。
Mm-hmm. I think it's a bet that Winna will take.

1189
01:18:46,827 --> 01:18:49,963
卡找到了吗?没有。
Has the card turned up? No.

1190
01:18:49,997 --> 01:18:51,533
地方检察官呢?
What about the DA?

1191
01:18:51,565 --> 01:18:54,201
你能把他们和抢劫案联系起来吗?
Can you tie them to the robberies?

1192
01:18:54,234 --> 01:18:56,136
竞技场的保安
The security guard from the arena,

1193
01:18:56,170 --> 01:18:58,338
他认为他能模仿罗德的声音。
he thinks he can ID Rhode's voice.

1194
01:18:58,372 --> 01:19:00,006
依情况而定的。
Circumstantial.

1195
01:19:00,039 --> 01:19:01,542
别这样，伙计。
Nah, come on, man.

1196
01:19:01,576 --> 01:19:03,143
没有证人。
No witnesses.

1197
01:19:03,176 --> 01:19:05,845
来吧。 每个人都能看出来是他们。
Come on. Everyone can see that it's them.

1198
01:19:05,878 --> 01:19:07,480
罗兹执行了这两项任务
Rhodes executed both jobs

1199
01:19:07,515 --> 01:19:12,453
就像贝利奇克的剧本一样
like it was straight out of Belichick's playbook.

1200
01:19:12,485 --> 01:19:14,188
你为什么不给比尔打电话?
Why don't you call Bill up?

1201
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:17,024
也许他在做兼职。
Maybe he's moonlighting.

1202
01:19:17,056 --> 01:19:19,059
拜托，别那么精辟。
Come on, don't be pithy.

1203
01:19:19,092 --> 01:19:21,194
你一点证据都没有。
You don't have a shred of evidence.

1204
01:19:21,228 --> 01:19:24,832
这些人靠抢猪皮为生。
These guys made a living fighting over a pigskin.

1205
01:19:24,864 --> 01:19:26,233
我是说，这不是什么大问题
I mean, it's not a big stretch

1206
01:19:26,266 --> 01:19:28,301
从一个前足球运动员… 嗯哼。
from being an ex-football player... Mm-hmm.

1207
01:19:28,335 --> 01:19:31,104
.．. 变成银行抢劫犯。嗯哼
...to becoming a bank robber. Mm-hmm.

1208
01:19:32,338 --> 01:19:33,974
这很有趣。
This was fun.

1209
01:19:34,007 --> 01:19:36,377
就这些吗?
That's it?

1210
01:19:39,613 --> 01:19:43,182
你知道，我在想。
You know, I was thinking.

1211
01:19:45,286 --> 01:19:47,054
我们试试你的方法怎么样?
What if we try your way?

1212
01:19:47,087 --> 01:19:49,390
你知道，就像，我们用传统的方式对待他们。
You know, like, we go old school on them.

1213
01:19:49,422 --> 01:19:52,359
试着摇动几个笼子，看看能掉出来什么。
Just try to shake a few cages and see what falls out.

1214
01:19:53,226 --> 01:19:54,461
你带窃听器了吗?
Are you wearing a wire?

1215
01:19:54,494 --> 01:19:56,363
得了吧，你一定是在开玩笑。
Come on, you must be kidding.

1216
01:19:56,396 --> 01:19:58,364
你现在身上有什么东西吗?
Do you have something on you now?

1217
01:19:58,399 --> 01:20:03,136
我只想结束这帮混蛋的事，然后回家。
I just want to close this book on these fuckers and just go back home.

1218
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:04,203
我讨厌纽约。
I hate New York.

1219
01:20:05,072 --> 01:20:06,306
不，我不喜欢。
No, I don't.

1220
01:20:07,307 --> 01:20:09,310
嗯，我知道。
Well, I do.

1221
01:20:12,546 --> 01:20:15,582
他们随时都能找到菲兹。
They can get to Fitz anytime.

1222
01:20:15,617 --> 01:20:17,417
我不能冒这个险。
I can't run that risk.

1223
01:20:19,453 --> 01:20:21,454
如果菲兹是你，
If Fitz was in your shoes,

1224
01:20:21,488 --> 01:20:26,025
难道你不希望他竭尽全力去阻止温娜吗?
wouldn't you want him doing everything in his power to stop Winna?

1225
01:21:12,072 --> 01:21:13,907
哦,不! 不，不，不!
Oh, no! No, no, no!

1226
01:21:13,940 --> 01:21:17,211
好了，所有人都他妈的趴在地上。
All right, everybody stay on the fucking ground.

1227
01:21:17,243 --> 01:21:20,279
我们会很快搞定的。 这是一起银行抢劫案。
We're gonna make this real quick. It's a bank robbery.

1228
01:21:20,314 --> 01:21:23,484
你可能知道，马上把这该死的袋子装上!

拿出手机，拨911!
Pull out your phones and dial 911!

1231
01:21:28,622 --> 01:21:32,527

Okay. Now you call and say to the New York police,

1232
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:35,662
“喂，我们被那只大灰狼抢了。
"Hello, we are being robbed by the big, bad wolf.

1233
01:21:35,697 --> 01:21:38,097
我们很害怕，害怕的小猪!”
And we're scared, scared little piggies!"

1234
01:21:38,131 --> 01:21:41,368

谢谢你！

Send everybody who can, every fucking piggy in the NYPD,

1237
01:21:48,242 --> 01:21:50,109
你他妈给我带路。

211正在进行中。

别睡得太晚，猪。
Don't stay up too late, piggies.

1247

他在那儿!

1248
01:22:42,162 --> 01:22:44,064
后退，后退。
Hold back, hold back.

放下武器。 举起手来。

狗屎! 趴下，趴下!
Shit! Stay down, stay down!

我戴着这东西看不见。

很高兴见到你。

01:26:09,503 --> 01:26:11,270
你在找什么? 啊,操!

1267
01:26:43,704 --> 01:26:45,773
上车吧。 你是想搞笑吗?

我们要去哪里?
Where are we going?

1270
01:27:21,373 --> 01:27:23,911
我们要去哪里?
Where are we going?

1271
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:33,353
怎么，你要开车送我去哪儿然后一枪爆了我的头吗?
What, are you gonna drive me somewhere and shoot me in the head?

1272
01:27:33,386 --> 01:27:35,957
你们是什么警察…
What kind of cop are y...

1273
01:27:40,528 --> 01:27:42,429
哦,他妈的!
Oh, fuck!

1274
01:27:45,966 --> 01:27:49,301
嗯…
Uh...

1275
01:27:51,438 --> 01:27:53,807
他们像对待皇室一样对待你。
They treat you like royalty.

1276
01:27:55,009 --> 01:27:57,578
你知道吗，奈特?
Did you know that, Knight?

1277
01:27:57,612 --> 01:27:59,814
你知道的。 你得到了金钱和名誉。

1278
01:27:59,846 --> 01:28:01,413
的女性。
The women.

1279
01:28:01,448 --> 01:28:03,551
然后在你认为你值得拥有的那一刻…
And then the moment you think you deserve it...

1280
01:28:04,786 --> 01:28:06,052
.．. 砰，他们把它拿走了。
...boom, they take it away.

1281
01:28:06,087 --> 01:28:07,854
那些你以为爱你的人，
And all those people you thought loved you,

1282
01:28:07,889 --> 01:28:09,689
它们也消失了，
they disappear too,

1283
01:28:09,724 --> 01:28:12,760
直到你只剩下偏头痛和该死的膝盖!
until all you're left with is migraines and a fucked knee!

1284
01:28:17,564 --> 01:28:20,534
还有一个困惑的家庭，他们只想要回到以前的你。
And a confused family who just wants the old you back.

1285
01:28:23,570 --> 01:28:25,539
我只想结束这一切。
I just want it to end.

1286
01:28:29,877 --> 01:28:31,712
我是说，你懂的，不是吗?
I mean, you get it, don't you?

1287
01:28:35,682 --> 01:28:38,519
你总是想做个正常人。
You're always trying to be normal.

1288
01:28:39,153 --> 01:28:40,621
但你不正常。
But you're not normal.

1289
01:28:40,654 --> 01:28:42,354
你甚至不知道什么是正常，
You don't even know what normal is,

1290
01:28:42,389 --> 01:28:44,792
所以你… 做他们训练你做的事。
so you... you do what they trained you to do.

1291
01:28:44,826 --> 01:28:47,094
你… 你… 你继续走。
You... You... You keep moving.

1292
01:28:47,127 --> 01:28:49,130
你走得快一些。 你跳得更高。</i>

</i>你打得更狠了

1294
01:28:50,931 --> 01:28:52,766
总是追逐。
Always chasing.

1295
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,100
温娜知道这一点!
Winna knew that!

1296
01:28:56,737 --> 01:28:58,972
你在听我说话吗?
Are you even listening to me?

1297
01:28:59,006 --> 01:29:00,807
你在听我说话吗?
Are you listening to me?

1298
01:29:03,677 --> 01:29:05,712
他们威胁我的家人。
They threatened my family.

1299
01:29:08,949 --> 01:29:11,118
温娜会派布丽加去找他们。
Winna's gonna send Brigga after them.

1300
01:29:11,985 --> 01:29:15,655
我知道… 我知道如果我… 如果我有这张卡，
And I know... I know if I... If I have this card,

1301
01:29:15,689 --> 01:29:16,990
我可以接近他。
I can get close to him.

1302
01:29:17,024 --> 01:29:18,859
如果我能接近他，
And if I can get close to him,

1303
01:29:18,893 --> 01:29:22,395
我… 我可以确保它不会再伤害任何人。
I... I can make sure that he never hurts anybody ever again.

1304
01:29:26,498 --> 01:29:29,904
我不希望我的女儿在没有父亲的情况下长大。
I don't want my daughter to grow up without her father.

1305
01:29:32,573 --> 01:29:33,673
我是说，她…
I mean, she's...

1306
01:29:33,707 --> 01:29:35,743
她是我的… 她就是我的世界。
She's my... She's my world.

1307
01:29:37,444 --> 01:29:39,079
我做这一切都是为了她。
And I did all of this for her.

1308
01:29:44,451 --> 01:29:46,485
我的意思是，这并不完全正确。
I mean, that's not completely true.

1309
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:48,521
我是说，我为自己做了很多。
I mean, I did a lot of it for me.

1310
01:29:48,555 --> 01:29:50,489
我为自己做了很多事，伙计。
I did a lot of it for me, man.

1311
01:29:51,158 --> 01:29:52,492
我只是…
I just...

1312
01:29:53,527 --> 01:29:55,162
他妈的。
Fuck.

1313
01:29:55,195 --> 01:29:56,963
你个白痴。
You fucking idiot.

1314
01:30:02,502 --> 01:30:04,604
是啊，我活该。
Yeah, it fucking serves me right.

1315
01:30:30,631 --> 01:30:33,935
哦,上帝。 该死的。 他妈的。
Oh, God. Damn it. Fuck.

1316
01:30:39,506 --> 01:30:40,740
Winna。
Winna.

1317
01:30:42,643 --> 01:30:44,744
你知道温娜到处都有保镖，对吧?
You know Winna's got guards everywhere, right?

1318
01:30:44,779 --> 01:30:45,979
所以呢?
So?

1319
01:30:47,881 --> 01:30:51,618
好吧，给我把枪。
All right, give me a gun.

1320
01:30:53,186 --> 01:30:54,956
他妈的给我把枪。
Give me a fucking gun.

1321
01:30:56,791 --> 01:30:58,490
好吗?
Please?

1322
01:31:15,309 --> 01:31:16,543
啊!
Ah!

1323
01:31:29,689 --> 01:31:30,957
奈特来了。
Knight is here.

1324
01:31:45,038 --> 01:31:47,908
你是对的。 我们应该派更多的警卫。
You were right. We should have gotten more guards.

1325
01:31:56,617 --> 01:32:00,087
该死的。 罗德?
Goddamn. Rhodes too?

1326
01:32:00,121 --> 01:32:02,122
也就是说警察离我们不远了。
That means the cops aren't far behind.

1327
01:32:04,125 --> 01:32:07,560
你能杀了他吗?
Will you just kill the guy?

1328
01:32:07,595 --> 01:32:08,628
好吗?
Please?

1329
01:32:09,329 --> 01:32:11,966
现在吗?是的。
Now? Yeah.

谢谢你！
Thank you.

1331
01:32:33,854 --> 01:32:35,555
卡片在哪里?
Where's the card?

1332
01:32:37,858 --> 01:32:38,893
先拿现金。
The cash first.

1333

我拿到你的现金了。

我什么事都得自己做。
I gotta do everything myself.

1337
01:33:41,921 --> 01:33:43,256
别挡道。
Get out of the way.

1338
01:34:07,847 --> 01:34:09,850
草泥马。
Motherfucker.

他要是写信就好了。
Wish he'd have wrote.

膝盖怎么样了?
How's the knee?
