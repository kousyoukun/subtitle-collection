1
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:13,638
Um...

2
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:18,435
I'm making this movie because, uh...

3
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,146
Which way you want me to look?

4
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:22,522
- Right here.
- Okay.

5
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:25,525
I'm basically making this movie

6
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:29,279
because I have 25 years

7
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:33,533
of footage and photos
of me and Cartoon's...

8
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,494
I guess, uh, journey in life,

9
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:39,789
and all the movement that we've...

10
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,292
Wait, let me see.

11
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,421
If you ain't got tatted by Cartoon,
you ain't got no tat.

12
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:48,965
If you ain't get shot by Estevan,
you got a weak photographer.

13
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,364
You can't tell the story of Estevan
without telling the story of Cartoon.

14
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,890
You know Toons, then you know Estev.

15
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,141
They are LA.

16
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,895
Premier representatives
of that Los Angeles culture.

17
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,605
Like, the pioneers.

18
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:06,232
Not just pioneers,
I mean, I think they're historians.

19
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,027
Storytellers, they're the image-makers.
The chroniclers.

20
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,864
When you say LA tattoo artists,
you can't not mention Mister Cartoon.

21
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,410
Nobody does art like Cartoon.

22
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,872
When you look at a Mister Cartoon tattoo,
you know that's Mister Cartoon.

23
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,415
Everybody knows Mister Cartoon.

24
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:23,958
The hip-hop tattoo artist.

25
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:27,212
Man, you got tatted by Toons,
it's, like, a level of respect.

26
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,253
Cartoon, baby.

27
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,881
- My boy Cartoon.
- Cartoon.

28
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,758
The world-famous Cartoon.

29
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,260
Everything Cartoon did, Estevan was there.

30
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:38,264
Estevan brings an authenticity
that is matched by none other.

31
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,225
Photographing gang members.

32
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,811
Capturing the whole culture
and everything, man.

33
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:47,190
Lowrider culture, tattoo culture,
shots of Skid Row.

34
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,234
Leaving pieces of history behind.

35
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,045
- These <i>vatos...</i>
- They showed

36
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,780
that you can do it the right way
if you do it the right way.

37
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,573
They take pride in all of that.

38
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,538
They paved the way
for a lot of people.

39
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,785
Even if they don't admit it.

40
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,787
We couldn't have done it
without these two guys.

41
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,870
It's about courage.

42
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,457
Just be true to who you are,
and a lot of people are terrified

43
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,542
of being who they are.

44
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,478
That's one of the reasons
they're so successful.

45
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,922
They mean what they say
and they say what they mean.

46
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,092
This is our thing,
and we wanna bring this out to the world.

47
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,260
LA's globalized.

48
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,263
They've joined forces,
and they've been unstoppable ever since.

49
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,404
Coming from a Chicano,
Mexican family,

50
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,990
believing in God is standard issue.

51
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,409
I was formerly raised Catholic.

52
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:44,330
I was told at a young age
that I was gifted, I was blessed,

53
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,915
I have a gift from God.

54
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:49,002
And when you tell a kid that every day

55
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,462
over and over and over,

56
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,964
they start to believe it.

57
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,009
So when my mom would ask me
to clean the room,

58
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,510
make my bed, I'd be like,

59
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:01,806
"I've been gifted from God.
I'm not gonna make my bed. Come on."

60
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,858
For me, work is happiness.
Yeah, I love to work.

61
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,402
I love doing photography. I love filming.

62
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,697
You know, when you say "work,"
that means you do something

63
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,075
and you get paid, so, yeah,
that means my bills can get paid,

64
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,328
and I can keep moving forward.

65
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,538
- Daddy!
- I'm not the best dad

66
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:26,956
or the best husband,

67
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,167
but I think I'm a good worker,

68
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,835
a good photographer,

69
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,004
and a pretty good friend.

70
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:37,800
Nobody could say I'd done them wrong.
If they do, they're a lying motherfucker.

71
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:41,930
If you focus,

72
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,265
you could see shit off of your talent.

73
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,642
You could travel the world.

74
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,853
You could go to Europe and shit.
Like, we've been all around the world.

75
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,814
You can buy a home for your family.

76
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,951
Art was like I had to scratch an itch.

77
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,202
I would see shit,

78
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,621
I would see a movie poster,

79
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:10,583
or I would see something
that made me wanna draw,

80
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:15,046
and I would get this kind of anxiety
that I had to draw,

81
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,799
I had to draw every day. To let it go.

82
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:27,267
He was young, very young, like... four.

83
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:33,231
At that time, he was drawing nostrils,
fingernails, earlobes,

84
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,942
you know, things that kids drew
with stick figures,

85
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:39,320
he was drawing,
doing very intricate things.

86
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:43,533
He was my first child, so I just thought
I was the greatest mom

87
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,660
because he was so good, you know?

88
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,954
His mom was, "You're the best.

89
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,707
You're amazing.
You're the best artist in the world.

90
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,500
You're gonna grow up to be wonderful."

91
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,211
And then, at some point,
you just believe it.

92
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,134
When I was a kid, my father met this guy
at the line at the bank.

93
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:04,679
He says, "I'm in karate.
I have a business, a karate business."

94
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:05,972
My dad comes home and he goes,

95
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,158
"I got great news.
You're going to martial arts school."

96
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,560
I go, "I don't wanna do that."
He goes, "Yeah."

97
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,103
Hey, I'm paying for that...

98
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,927
...you're gonna go.

99
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:18,860
When he first started, he was real shy,
wouldn't talk to anybody.

100
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,529
But maybe about a year after karate,

101
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:25,658
I would say that he was so confident
that he'd walk straight up.

102
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,786
Going to the karate school introduced me

103
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,663
to the world of candy paint

104
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,293
because the grand master of the school
was also a custom car painter,

105
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:38,755
so I learned all those things,
you know, the murals, the candy paint,

106
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,466
respect, the flow of life.

107
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,468
All these things kind of went in a circle.

108
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,551
It's crazy.

109
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:51,017
I'm Estevan Oriol.
I'm a photographer and director.

110
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,058
Raised in LA.

111
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,646
I was born in Santa Monica
at Saint John's Hospital.

112
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,856
So you got Estevan.

113
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,567
Like, this tall cholo guy,

114
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,986
but then most people don't know
he's half Italian.

115
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:05,406
My mom and dad were married
up until I was about three.

116
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,576
And they split up,
and it was me and my mom.

117
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,286
To me, my mom was great.

118
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,581
We grew up on welfare,
food stamps and Medi-Cal,

119
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:17,001
but she did her best
to make it the best for me.

120
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,920
Any time you have mixed-race children,

121
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:23,091
they grow up a little bit confused though,
"Am I this race or am I this race?"

122
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:26,677
And at some point, you just gotta choose.
He chose the Latino side.

123
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,361
I didn't even know it until years later.

124
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,140
My dad,
he was kind of like a hippie.

125
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,394
He didn't give a shit about having
a nice car and all that shit,

126
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,855
so that pushed me to strive for more.

127
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,774
That's what gave me my drive.

128
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,276
So after high school,
I worked at a snack bar,

129
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,694
I worked on fishing boats,

130
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,946
supermarkets,

131
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,906
liquor store delivery.

132
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:50,827
I always had, like, one, two, three jobs.

133
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,875
At the time, in the '80s,

134
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,294
it was all about where do you fit in

135
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,586
in hip-hop.

136
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,340
Are you a breaker? Are you a rapper?

137
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,260
Are you a locker? Are you a writer?

138
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,430
And I was like, "I love breakdancing,

139
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,849
and all that shit," but I couldn't hang.

140
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,517
But I could draw.

141
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,769
Cartoon, uh, always had a marker

142
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,439
or a can of spray paint with him
all the time.

143
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,316
And wherever we were at, he'd hit up.

144
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,820
'Cause I was hip-hop.
I had a b-boy side of me.

145
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:30,658
It was, like, bombing, 3-Ds, fade.

146
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:35,997
You know, before the Cartoon
that he's known for today,

147
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,874
he was an awesome graffiti writer.

148
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:42,378
He was from this crew WCA
that was kind of legendary

149
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,921
and was really fucking good.

150
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,550
I go to probably late '80s
with Cartoon.

151
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,093
He was "Flame" at the time.

152
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,864
I thought I knew everybody.
I was like, "Who the fuck is this?"

153
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,015
And he had such a unique style,
and was so different.

154
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,851
He hit and run. Like, I'd see a wall,
and next day I was like,

155
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,854
"Where did this come from?
Who did it?" You know.

156
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,772
I basically
do graffiti everywhere I go.

157
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,988
It brought me a rush,
like, you can go to jail for this shit.

158
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:19,832
He put his name, "Flame,"
on the graffiti piece,

159
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,376
and, so, he was caught,
you know, for doing that.

160
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,009
There was something different
about him.

161
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,384
We had an idea that someday
he was gonna do something,

162
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,804
that he was gonna go somewhere,
he was gonna be something in life.

163
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,681
It's like a work of art in there.

164
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,434
We were all proud of this,
when he came out in the paper.

165
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,729
I was just searching
for my look, you know?

166
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,606
What felt good and what felt real to me.

167
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:47,068
I went to LA Trade-Tech
to learn Sign Graphics,

168
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,486
to understand letters.

169
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,072
Letters have a weight to them.

170
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:55,201
When I was in school,
all the kids knew where the prisons were,

171
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,888
and some of them would get letters
from their family members,

172
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,372
and I would look at the envelope

173
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:03,709
and see these crazy collaged,
pinta-style envelopes

174
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,836
and I would think to myself,

175
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,634
"Man, if I could mix that style of artwork
with bombing graffiti style,

176
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:12,843
put them together."

177
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,845
That's where my style was born.

178
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,440
When I hit 19,
I moved to Hollywood.

179
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,359
Sunset Boulevard was cracking.

180
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:29,777
The Whisky, The Roxy.

181
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,028
Hip-hop was new.

182
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,406
Just that scene was fucking off the chain,

183
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,200
and I was working nightclubs
for extra money.

184
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,703
And that's where I met all the LA bands.

185
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,997
Ice-T and the Rhyme Syndicate,

186
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,540
the Red Hot Chili Peppers,

187
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:43,708
Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E.,

188
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,293
Everlast from House of Pain.

189
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,419
That's how I met Muggs.

190
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:49,338
And then he took me down to the block
on Cypress Ave,

191
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,215
and that's where I met B-Real and Sen.

192
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,558
So, this right here is SP 1200.

193
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:04,437
This is the drum machine that we did
um, all the House of Pain's records.

194
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,733
<i>♪ Pack it up, pack it in
Let me begin ♪</i>

195
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,485
The sample though...
For "Jump Around," I made it.

196
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,071
Horn player... came in the studio,
played the horn,

197
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,616
and I put it in here, then I detuned it.

198
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,076
When you detune it,
it gives it like a crunch.

199
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,828
<i>♪ Feelin', funkin'
Amps in the trunk ♪</i>

200
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,789
It spreads it out a little bit.
That's why that sounds unique.

201
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:31,255
First time I met Estevan, he was working
the door of a club on 2nd Street

202
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,090
in, like, Little Tokyo.

203
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,054
He just would always
show me love and let me in.

204
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,553
That's the homie Steve-O,
short for Steve Oriol.

205
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,556
Switched it up to Scan.
Scan was just Scandalous.

206
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,701
After we started
getting the music together,

207
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,245
and we realized we were gonna go
on the road, Muggs basically said,

208
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,563
"Yo, I know exactly who should be
your road manager."

209
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,358
Who can I get that's fucking responsible
and got they shit together?

210
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,441
And I was like, "Who?"

211
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,818
I hit up Scan and then, um...

212
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,320
He became our tour manager.

213
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,863
That was it, right there.

214
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,240
That was the beginning
of us having worldwide escapades.

215
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,662
In the beginning, people
didn't know that House of Pain was white.

216
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,059
People were like, "What the fuck?"

217
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,323
"What are these fucking white boys
walking through here?"

218
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,437
And then they'd hear the...

219
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,092
And the whole fucking club
would just go buck wild, berserk,

220
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,344
and they're just losing
their fucking minds.

221
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,179
From there, it just took off.

222
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,809
I was with the band in the music videos,
like "Shamrocks and Shenanigans."

223
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,978
When I wasn't here in LA,
I was on tour with House of Pain.

224
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,564
My dad, he was a photographer.

225
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,317
He thought I lived
kind of a cool lifestyle, so...

226
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,445
This is my first camera
that my dad gave me.

227
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,615
This is the one that I talk about
when people say,

228
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,576
"Oh, how did you start in photography?"

229
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,579
We would go on these
little really fucked-up promo tours,

230
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,790
and he was just always taking pictures.

231
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,593
I figured out
that I was gonna be an artist

232
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,595
when it was time to get a real job.

233
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,932
I think airbrushing T-shirts,
when I first did that,

234
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,559
about 17 years old,

235
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,186
is when I knew
I could do this for a living.

236
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,480
And I would paint
portraits of people's cars,

237
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,692
put it on a T-shirt
and put the name over top.

238
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,111
I just started working right off the bat.

239
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,405
Cartoon's Customs was born,

240
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,741
kind of like preparing me to tattoo.

241
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,121
Scandalous got the camera.

242
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,915
Japan. It's how we do it.

243
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,675
Chicken and soup.
And I'm gonna get the spinach and butter.

244
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,697
When you're on the road, man,
shit can get a bit stressful.

245
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,241
You need somebody out there
that knows everybody's personalities

246
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,851
and everything,
keep everything at ease all the time.

247
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:52,813
Every day was a new adventure,
new city, new country, new shows.

248
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,916
It was the shit, to roll with the homie.

249
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,858
Hey, Steve-O.

250
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:59,153
He wasn't Estevan Oriol, the photographer.
He was the road dog.

251
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,491
They got the homie.

252
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:07,745
Cypress Hill, at the time, had not only...
selling crazy records or platinum records,

253
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,580
but a well-respected hip-hop group.

254
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,750
B-Real was one of the dopest emcees
in the world at the time.

255
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,336
Look at this view, motherfuckers.

256
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,130
I look fucking good.

257
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,843
You never have to ask me if I'm ready.
I'm always ready, motherfucker. Fuck you.

258
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,975
Oh, shit. That was a good hit.

259
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,771
Muggs had put on Estevan
to work with the House of Pain guys

260
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,440
and then he came to work with us,
Cypress Hill.

261
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,443
His first show
with us was at Woodstock 1994.

262
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,866
B-Real jumps off the stage
into the crowd, now I gotta pull him out,

263
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,244
but while I'm pulling him out,
I'm taking pictures.

264
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,578
That shit was fucking crazy.

286
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,296
No one ever wore one hat.

287
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:45,134
You know, everybody did multiple things
just to get whatever we needed done,

288
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,928
and Estevan, you know,
he covered a lot of bases,

289
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,264
and, at the same time,
being our family and friend

290
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:53,684
and filling every spot
that needed to be filled.

I have Steve-O in my head
always saying things like,

310
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,646
"I'm just right here.
I'm just right here."

311
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:39,998
Him, I think, saying to me,

00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,262
"Don't worry about it.
I'm doing my job. I'm right here."

313
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,753
Alright, we're still on our way.

314
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,741
The most pissed-on
fucking countryside I've seen.

00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,803

- We need to get there before you do.

You can't get in that way.
It's too small.

321
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,174
- We wanna go backstage.
- Yeah, you got a pass?

322
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,843
Yeah, we... This is our pass. Cypress Hill.

323
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,637
- Cypress... Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

324
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,390
We made it, Engolf.

325
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,368
I'm on tour
with The Beastie Boys,

326
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,559

and all these other bands,

329
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,024
and I'm the only one there with a camera.

330
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,714
You're going from nothing
to seeing thousands of people

331
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:33,492
losing their fucking minds to the song
that you guys are bringing, you know?

332
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,536
So, you're, like, "Fuck, man."

333
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,663
That's when I started, like, feeling like,

334
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:40,416
"Okay, yeah, I need
to take pictures of all this shit."

335
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,462
This is Southern California, motherfucker.

336
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:49,216
I started offering my photos
to the magazines,

337
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,885
so music magazines
started publishing my photos.

338
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,894
Yo, kick it off, dog.

339

The motherfucker was the man, you know?
He was a man of many hats.

342
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,613
When I met him,
I was about 14, 15 years old.

343
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,658
I was in the group The Whooliganz.
I rapped. I was a rapper.

Me and my man Scotty.
Scotty Caan.

346
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,792
We had made a record with B-Real,
so they were bringing us out on tour

347
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,836
to pump up our record
that hadn't come out yet.

348
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,131
So, I'm 16 years old in that situation,

349
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,968
with nothing to do,
but be alive for one hour.

350
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,970
Otherwise, it was, like, hit on girls,

351
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,306
smoke weed and drink,
and hang out with your idols.

352
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:41,226
I don't like to represent an age group.
I'm representing hip-hop.

353
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,725
You know,
he started fucking with the camera then...

354
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,231
Alchemist started fucking
with beats then and...

355
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,834
- Can we say "fuck"?
- Yeah.

356

You talk about that time,
you can't not curse.

357
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,861
It's impossible, you know?

358
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,864
You gotta remember, in '93,
Soul Assassins,

359
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,533
Cypress Hill, House of Pain,
they were the top of rap.

360
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,203
You know, you had Dre and Snoop otherwise,

361
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:02,456
but other than that,
this was the biggest shit going on.

362
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,458
That was Soul Assassins. We were the top.

363
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:11,507
I met Estevan Oriol
25 plus years ago.

364
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,343
It was surreal for a 16-year-old
to go to a concert

365
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,946
with The Whooliganz opening up
for House of Pain and Cypress Hill

366
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,156
at the height of their career.

367
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,620
We were backstage, and they almost
shut the whole concert down

368
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:23,352
because some guy named Estevan
punched out the bootleggers.

369
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,897
They would get your artwork
from the newspaper and make a shirt.

370
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,209
Like an hour before the show,
a couple... All the homeboys

371
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,113
would like, put their hoods on and, like,
go walk through the parking lot

372
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,905
and you'd just be sittin'
by the, you know, by the trailers,

373
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,824
- and you just hear, "Wham!"
- Damn!

374
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,159
And dudes would just get knocked out cold,
like...

375
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,369
I won't name any names.

376
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,163
- Name names.
- Muggs, Estevan.

377
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,706
Motherfucker said something...

378
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,750
So I punch him in the face.

379
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:47,876
Poor guy.

380
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,640
So, that's when I met Estevan Oriol.

381
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,390
Him beating up a bootlegger
in San Francisco

382
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,507
at a Soul Assassins' concert.

383
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,176
When I met Steve-O, he was tour manager,

384
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,720
the all-time funny guy...

385
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,975

where he even may have filled in

389
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,573
as a member of Cypress Hill in interviews.

390

the controversy is going to continue.

- Thanks for having us.

And now, back to New York.

394
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,625
Then fight!

395
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,758
I think it all changed, though,
when I did my first album cover.

396
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,053
There were the 1992 riots.

397
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,889
It's not a message of protest.

398
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,266
It's the brutality of a mob.

399
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,605
The verdict was read,
and the streets went crazy.

400
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,317
Shit just happened.

401
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:57,362
Blacks and Mexicans started looking
at each other, communicating

402
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,989
like family.

403
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,867
Boy, they didn't like that.
They didn't like that.

404
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:05,662
I remember that day,
driving on the 110 freeway,

405
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:10,083
going to Hollywood
and seeing the sides of the 110

406
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,835
with fire on each side of it.

407
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,671
What it did was, it spawned a relationship

408
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,549
from '92 to now that they can never break.

409
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,093
But as crazy as that shit was,

410
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,012
that everything was on fire

411
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:24,890
and the injustice against Rodney King,

412
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,476
and "fuck the police," and this and that,

413
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,021
I was driving,
and the Kid Frost album cover I had drawn

414
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,440
was blown up on a billboard

415
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,733
for Virgin Records.

416
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:39,696
Now I'm in the music game,
and I don't even play the guitar.

417
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,745
Behind me is
where me and Cartoon first met.

418
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,623
On that particular night,
they rented out the top floor

419
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:52,251
for The Penthouse Players
record release party.

420
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,295
Me and my friend Donnie Charles,
we went there together.

421
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,797
Right when we walked in,

422
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,757
he saw Cartoon, and he goes, "Hey..."

423
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,385
"Come over here, uh,
I want you to meet my other homie.

424
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,552
He's Mexican too."

425
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,236
"Both of you guys are in the music game.

426
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,723
He did The Penthouse Players' album cover.

427
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,810
You guys just kick it right here,
and I'm gonna go roll around."

428
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:13,605
"E" impacted my life
because I found someone

429
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,732
that was on the same mission I was,

430
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,985
artistically, friendship-wise.

431
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,570
I remember him telling me,
"Mommy," says,

432
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:24,116
"I met a guy that thinks
along the same lines I do."

433
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:27,077
Probably my first seeing Cartoon
was, like, early '94.

434
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,787
If I remember correctly,

435
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,873
it was at Muggs' crib
up in the Hollywood Hills.

436
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:36,753
- They were in a '64 Impala.
- It is a buddy comedy.

437
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,798
Abbott and Costello.
These two motherfuckers was non-stop.

438
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,216
They knew how to hustle.

439
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,180
At the beginning,
it was rough for us.

440
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:46,805
And the more we hung out,
the more we just started building on ideas

441
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:50,142
of things that we could do
to make money that weren't illegal.

442
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,370
The check dance.
Let's see the... Let's see the...

443
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,562
The stripper check.

444
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:59,026
Back in those days, you know,
there was no Estevan without Cartoon.

445
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:04,656
Cartoon's role in Soul Assassins,
he's like the... the visuals.

446
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:07,534
We saw the talent in him.
We believed in him.

447
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:16,043
Get in there.
Get in there, fucker.

448
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,126
For real?

449
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,757
Turn the camera off!

450
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,138
- Where we at?
- We're in a ferry right now.

451
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:30,223
Fucking eight in the morning and shit.

452
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,850
I'm so tired.

453
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,270
All that tour life, man,
I think that's what kind of molded us

454
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,231
to be able to have
different relationships, you know?

455
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,941
Just living that life, man.

456
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,627
- You're high, man.
- Wow!

457
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,379
What do you think about that?
It looks crazy.

458
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,283
I'll take a little piece and taste it.

459
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,325
When Cartoon first started coming around,
he started doing all of our shit.

460
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,577
He was mad talented.

461
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,080
I would do the stage design.

462
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,525
<i>Check, check.</i>

463
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,124
Artwork that I had drawn

464
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,503
would get blown up
into this big giant blow-up doll

465
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,630
of a king sitting on a throne,

466
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,632
the most gangster shit I could think of.

467
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,676
I hadn't even started tattooing.
I didn't even have a tattoo yet.

468
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,011
It wasn't until later I started

469
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,555
hangin' around
professional tattoo shops that...

470
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,100
...the smell of the green soap,

471
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,394
the energy of the shop kind of drew me in.

472
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,146
My life would go another direction.

473
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,827
This is NFC,
stands for "No Fat Chicks."

474
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:36,748
A long, long time ago,
I made a tattoo machine...

475
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,626
for my partner Cartoon.

476
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,170
And this is what he started
tattooing me with.

477
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,882
Even though I was good
at drawing on paper,

478
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:50,595
and I could do graffiti, airbrush,
skin was a completely different world.

479
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,683
His transition
from drawing to the tattoo game

480
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,685
had everybody shook.

481
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,092
I don't remember exactly
how he transitioned,

482
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,946
but I remember, like, his first tattoos.
It was, like, "Oh, it's over."

483
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,568
Cartoon came in
and changed the game.

484
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:07,404
From spraying on a metal
to "Give me this fucking gun,"

485
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,531
he just, like, took to skin

486
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,700
like it was just second nature.

487
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,123
In the early days,
he'd bring me all my customers.

488
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,459
I'd just see all these people
and all these bands,

489
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,878
and I'd see their tattoos and I was like,

490
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,714
"Fuck, man, that tattoo looks like shit."

491
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,841
Just see them at a concert and be like,

492
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:30,177
"Oh, you like tattoos?
That's a nice tattoo.

493
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,888
You ever got tattooed by Cartoon?
He did this on me."

494
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,806
And I showed them mine,
and they were fresh.

495
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:35,970
Most of the guys were like,

496
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,809
"Oh, that's badass, you know.
Who did that?"

497
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,812
"My boy Cartoon. He brought his shit.
You can get tattooed with him."

498
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,981
That's how I got all my clients, you know?

499
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:44,316
My big ones.

500
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,991
There is so much going on with those guys.

501
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,622
They're super ambitious,
super creative.

502
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,309
You just want this same style,
but just a little more symmetrical.

503
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,291
Like this.

504
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,794
Super fun to be around.

505
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,587
Super assholes at times.

506
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,591
Hey, Paul,
we're ready to get Jewish, get right.

507
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,927
I know Toons went
on the Anger Management Tour

508
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,010
over to Europe.

509
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:14,513
Everybody hung out.

510
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,223
Anger Management Tour.

511
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,099
- This was the tour.
- Damn.

512
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,976
We're doing
these European festivals

513
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,229
and you get access to all these bands.

514
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,647
I mean, all-access pass.

515
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:27,526
Whookid is accused
of trying to bribe a prostitute

516
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,569
with a mixtape and two tickets.

517
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,575
Order in court! Order in court!

518
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,662
Did you or did you not pay for pussy?

519
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,247
I paid for entertainment.

520
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,673
He's a pro at that, man.

521
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,473
It was crazy, he was tattooing
on tour over there in Europe.

522
00:25:58,765 --> 00:25:59,849
Amsterdam.

523
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,602
I came over here to Europe
to come with Cypress Hill.

524
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:07,065
Actually,
it's a Cartoon tour featuring 50 Cent.

525
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,775
He makes me want a tattoo and shit.

526
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:11,987
- Eminem.
- Cartoon, homie. Y'all can't afford it.

527
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,573
- Xzibit.
- Fucking ecstasy, man!

528
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,740
Cypress Hill.

529
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:19,202
It ain't easy, but somebody gotta do it.
Why the hell not you, right?

530
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,496
Basically, my tattoo customers
are getting together

531
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,373
and throwing some type of little concert.

532
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:25,667
That was pretty cool
'cause he was doing it sometimes

533
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,710
right backstage.

534
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:33,109
- You're coming with us tomorrow, right?
- We're coming at 3:00 p.m. 2:00 p...

535
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,133
No, 1:00 p.m.

536
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,345
I was Proof before it, but this really...

537
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:41,266
Wow! I'm Proof now, for real, for real,
you know what I'm saying?

538
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,085
Motherfuckers are bored,

539
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,520
so when you have a tattoo machine
going in the back...

540
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,914
What do you got on that shoulder?

541
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:50,317
...and you're in Germany somewhere,
you're gonna be there all day.

542
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,776
He's got another victim.

543
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,822
He shoulda did a class photo
with all his ink victims on this tour.

544
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:00,910
He did Bizarre from D12.
He did his belly, man.

545
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,121
I remember, I was there
just watching him do this.

546
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,623
He had a lot of real estate.

547
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:08,543
He had lot of real estate right there.
It was crazy.

548
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:09,919
If you're a rapper

549
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:14,633
and you ain't got a tattoo by Cartoon,
then you ain't living.

550
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,473
I was just that guy in the industry

551
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,725
and people were coming to see me
because of my work.

552
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,894
I surrounded myself by talent.

553
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,374
25 years old,
this is holding its weight.

554
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,959
DL, all day strong.
Know what I'm talkin' bout?

555
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:53,630
<i>Hola.</i>

556
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,244
Is there anywhere
to go get something to eat?

557
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:08,687
Terminal two.

558
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,355
- Huh?
- Terminal two.

559
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,198
- How do you get there?
- You go...

560
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,943
Where did she say to turn?

561
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,194
The green ramp.

562
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:21,366
New York City. No one's here.

563
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,594
- You need that?
- No.

564
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,378
Let's go.

565
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,697
Before you know it,
everybody was calling Cartoon.

566
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,753
He was top name, flying him in.

567
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,631
Well, at that point in time,
everybody started getting tatted up.

568
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,007
Hey, let's order a pizza pie.

569
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,568
Gang Starr, you know what I'm saying?

570
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:42,512
That means that's me
and my motherfucking man Preemo, okay?

571
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:43,763
- DJ Premier.
- Yeah.

572
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:48,309
Only real shit gets done
on me anyway, so the realest shit,

573
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,602
Mister Cartoon.

574
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:50,854
This hot, though, this hot.

575
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,480
He's created a masterpiece.

576
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,402
Busted.

577
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:02,240
I'm gonna leave my whole little
cigarette binge right here in New York,

578
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,323
where I found it.

579
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:04,969
I thought you found it in Tokyo.

580
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:05,993
Yeah, but...

581
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:08,329
I can't leave it there
cause I'm over here.

582
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:11,791
That nigga Cartoon be doin'.

583
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:20,091
You see, this is how we do it.

584
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,177
And... And what you have with Estevan...

585
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,221
If I tell you to shut the fuck up,
will you shut the fuck up?

586
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,474
Insane drug addict, alcoholic.

587
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,808
He was partying his ass off.

588
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:32,270
I might've experimented
with every kind of drug you could try.

589
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,814
PCP, blow, mushrooms,

590
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,900
acid, ecstasy,

591
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,026
MDMA.

592
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,612
I'd wake up
with the craziest cramps in my legs.

593
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,614
And... it was just too much.

594
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,616
We looked at each other and we were like,

595
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,701
"We need to go to the next level, man."

596
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:50,205
And to go to the next level,
"E" had to leave...

597
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,791
the substances behind.

598
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,083
And he got sober

599
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:57,670
and sponsored
countless amount of people for years.

600
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:00,757
Once he got sober,
I just seen domination kick in.

601
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,842
And they grew that empire,

602
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,719
Soul Assassins Studios.

603
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,805
Before you know it...

604
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,788
I mean, should I tell you...
I can tell you the whole story now.

605
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,349
<i>♪ Now here's a little something
That needs to be heard ♪</i>

606
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,446
My first time going to S.A. Studios,

607
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,906
lowriders,

608
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,200
rims,

609
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,952
the art on the wall.

610
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,246
I was like a kid in a candy store.

611
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:35,124
It was like a Chicano...

612
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,210
like a camp, like a club.

613
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,295
These dudes are like cholo Da Vincis.

614
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:42,423
I never would've found them
if I hadn't become successful.

615
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,884
Yeah. Yeah. Check, check.

616
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:48,429
Yo. I remember walking in,
though, and being like,

617
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,557
"Damn, you guys made it."

618
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,143
'Cause it was, like, fucking incredible.

619
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,436
You're in downtown,

620
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,772
and you're in the thick of it,
Skid Row is right there,

621
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,024
and that spot was super jammin'.
I loved that.

622
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,443
It seemed like it should be
like a tour museum.

623
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,237
Like, people need to see that shit.

624
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:08,324
When we first moved down here,
this was an extension of Skid Row.

625
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:12,495
This is where the homeless used to live.
The people on drugs or mentally ill.

626
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,081
That's what this area was like before.

627
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:18,585
Can you see it? All right.
The Art Department were those two windows.

628
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,503
And we had like a little showroom here.

629
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:24,841
We had all of our cars
laid out behind these windows.

630
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,801
Inside that double doors right there

631
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:30,221
was Cartoon's Skid Row Tattoo.

632
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,348
S.A. Studios. That was a great time.

633
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,600
It was like a hideout.

634
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:36,394
You guys gave us the tour.
Like, showed us a bunch of shit.

635
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,813
It was kind of like a wild playground.

636
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,274
Come on! Let's go! Busted! Yeah!

637
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:42,400
Shalom.

638
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,611
Yeah, I got a good tattoo
for you guys right here.

639
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,905
Oh!

640
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,032
The Jew unit in effect,
you know what I'm saying?

641
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,328
We have these two guys
with shaved heads covered in tattoos,

642
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,891
and then you go to their office,
and they have their own Nikes,

643
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,248
they have their own Vans.

644
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,667
And Estevan's sittin' there,
and his room's a mess,

645
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,086
and he has like a little gun on the table.

646
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,924
Motorcycles.
It was the illest, illest studio ever.

647
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,259
It was nothing like I'd ever seen before.

648
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,886
I'm green with envy.

649
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:13,264
When I walked out and I saw Too $hort,
and then I saw Darlene,

650
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,224
Ice-T's old wife, right?

651
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,643
Well, I saw 50 there.

652
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:17,769
I saw Dre, Snoop.

653
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:20,021
You know, every day
was somebody else coming through.

654
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,940
I saw her walking in, and I'm like,

655
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,692
"Oh, this must be the spot."
You know what I'm saying? Like...

656
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,778
I saw Eminem over there.

657
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:27,904
He tatted me there.

658
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,667
I think one day
I saw Kim Kardashian there.

659
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:32,075
Went and done a photo shoot with her
or whatever.

660
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,358
You guys still got that place?

661
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,704
The building itself
seemed slightly dangerous.

662
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,872
Oh, there comes shitbox.

663
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,833
I'm sure it's really dangerous,
but since you planted

664
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,377
your spot there it became...

665
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,504
It was like a safe house or something.

666
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,923
The homeless people around it,
they took care of it.

667
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:49,606
You know, that's why no one
ever really messed with that building.

668
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,887
Pull your ass over.
Face the wall.

669
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,765
And I wanna see your ID and your bike.

670
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:57,433
There's my ID,

671
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,893
there's my nutsack,

672
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,311
and fuck you, my ass.

673
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:04,482
It seems like we were able
to exist in multiple worlds.

674
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:05,692
You know what I'm saying?

675
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:08,194
For lunch, we'd be in downtown

676
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:11,322
and bullshitting
with some crazy homeless guy in his tent.

677
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,741
Estevan would jump out
and take a picture of him.

678
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:18,413
And then we'd jump on the 10 freeway
and be at a five-star hotel.

679
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,415
It was just normal,
you know what I'm saying?

680
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,167
I'm Pepper, you know?

681
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:26,129
I'm Skid Row's
most highest-ranked right now.

682
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,839
I'm the mayor of Skid Row.

683
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:30,216
The homeless pretty much answer to me.

684
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,677
Factory place was dead.

685
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,388
When Joker, Cartoon, everyone come here.

686
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,433
They brought the factory to life, okay?

687
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,560
And then I came into the scene.

688
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,479
- How old you turn?
- Forty-one.

689
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,023
Okay, I'm 50.

690
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,775
Soon to be 51 in a couple of months.

691
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:51,779
I'm an ex-convict,
ex-drug dealer, ex-drug user.

692
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,489
I gutted his ass.

693
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,867
We got in an argument, so I gutted him.

694
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:58,286
This family never gave up on me.

695
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:02,749
They never gave up on me when I was
all filthy, drugged out and shit.

696
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,792
When I was thrown in and out
of County Jail,

697
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,756
they accepted me with open arms
when I come out.

698
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,255
I've been dealing
with homeless people

699
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,548
all my life, you know.

700
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,175
They don't wanna follow rules.

701
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,135
I work when I wanna work.

702
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,971
Sleep when I wanna sleep.

703
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:20,016
Sleep where I wanna sleep.

704
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,895
They have a problem
with authority.

705
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:27,315
And whoever don't like it,
fuck them in their ass and suck my dick.

706
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,276
For the fourth time today.
This is harassment.

707
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,403
Fourth time being stopped for no reason.

708
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,300
- See you tomorrow, Pepper!
- All right.

709
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:39,243
We could fall off
and lose all our shit.

710
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,620
Pepper's world.

711
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:43,289
So, any of us
could be walking the streets, you know?

712
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:44,832
Drugs will take you down there.

713
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:49,212
But that's the way life goes.
Life is about change.

714
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,380
And change is what it's about.

715
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:54,985
Look,
if y'all gonna keep telling me

716
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,303
which way to move,
we can't do no interview. Damn!

717
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,722
Look, are you good, cameraman? All right.

718
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:03,142
Listen, I'm Big Lepke,
Westside Rebels, gangster <i>locos.</i>

719
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,977
Yeah, I'm an ex-gang member.

720
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,271
We up on Skid Row. We keep it real.

721
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,774
Today we ain't trippin'.
Ain't no heroin in the veins.

722
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,150
Ain't no rock in the mouth.

723
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,069
Skid Row was my home.

724
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:15,071
Some people call it "hell."
I call it "home."

725
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,280
The city I roam.

726
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,742
So, right here Lepke
would get the boxes

727
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,285
from when we'd throw them out,

728
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,121
and he'd make
like a little bed right here.

729
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,748
I remember one time
we were coming to have a meeting here

730
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:28,167
and Lepke, he'd been shooting heroin.

731
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:31,754
We were like,
"Great, fucking Lepke's passed out.

732
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:35,049
The clients are coming,
and we're gonna have this big meeting,

733
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,802
and there's our, you know,
dopefiend friend

734
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:40,513
passed out from shooting too much heroin.

735
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,559
You know, he didn't OD, so we didn't
have to stick an ice cube up his ass.

736
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:48,229
But he was knocked out,
so we had to spray him with some water...

737
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,732
so he could come to.

738
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,484
Hey.

739
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:55,945
Come back.

740
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,655
Get him later.

741
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:58,948
I'm over here, kickin' it.

742
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:01,093
- Don't threaten me, man.
- Hey, motherfucker.

743
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,744
No, no, we told him, "You gotta go.
We're gonna have a meeting."

744
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,663
Oh, suck a dick.

745
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:09,167
Yeah, he squirted some water in my nose,
and it was a cool wake-up call.

746
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,730
I always think about stuff like that.

747
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,378
You're gonna get kicked.

748
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:15,965
So, downtown has always been
a Soul Assassins' headquarters.

749
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,970
It was kind of like a home base.
Kind of reminds me of Grand Theft Auto.

750
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,221
Estevan was upstairs,

751
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,764
Cartoon was tattooing.

752
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,142
There was eyes on it.
It was protected, man, yeah.

753
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,853
There's like a shield around it
or something.

754
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:32,315
But you take pictures, you do cars,
all that stuff in that space.

755
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,275
You tattoo there.

756
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,904
There's only one guy
that I let do my tattoos,

757
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,363
and my kids' tattoos.

758
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,574
The great Cartoon.

759
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,644
How does the car look?

760
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,545
Great.

761
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,756
Tattoos used to be a stigma.

762
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:57,839
I mean, a bad one.

763
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,258
When I got out of the pen,

764
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,595
the first girl I saw with a tattoo, I...
I thought she was a hooker.

765
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,513
Before him, tattooing hip-hop guys,

766
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:07,433
I don't think there was
a prominent position in hip-hop

767
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,156
where guys were getting tatted like that.

768
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,479
Nobody was...
Like, in hip-hop, was about that.

769
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:12,563
I mean...

770
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:16,651
Fuck, I mean, I feel like Cartoon
gave Eminem one of his first tattoos,

771
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,237
Didn't he? He gave Snoop
one of his first tattoos.

772
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,198
Look at this, man.
I really look like my old boy Nate Dogg.

773
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,575
It looks like my lovely wife.

774
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,202
He captured that, man.

775
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,788
I mean, I don't even have
a Cartoon tattoo, believe it or not.

776
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,790
That's, you know what I mean,
I'd love one.

777
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:34,126
But, you know, I'm not paying 50 Gs.
I'm just not doing it.

778
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,421
This guy is the best in the world,
but he costs an arm and a leg.

779
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,425
He'll tattoo your arm
and he'll take it with you.

780
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,926
Hey, man, it's worth it.

781
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,988
- Talk about your new tattoo.
- Cartoon is the greatest tattoo artist

782
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,555
to ever live.

783
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:51,227
This should be enough for this,
because, my man...

784
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,355
He's the greatest, the quickest, uh...

785
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,483
- With the biggest truck.
- With the biggest truck.

786
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,735
It's getting expensive, man.

787
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:01,946
With the biggest truck...

788
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,031
in the world, probably.

789
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:06,993
I mean, his clientele, you know,
it's like, you know, Travis,

790
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,577
and Eminem, Redman,

791
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:09,996
Method Man, you know,

792
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,372
Justin Timberlake,

793
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:12,999
Beyoncé from Destiny's Child...

794
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:14,208
Don't show me.

795
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,562
It's appointment only

796
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:20,673
and not every deek off the street
can just come in and get something.

797
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,883
I knew If I was gonna get
my fucking head done,

798
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,136
for what I wanted and stuff,
and the style,

799
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,822
I knew it was gonna be Cartoon, you know.

800
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:44,864
That was an experience.

801
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:47,366
I would hear his name in songs.
The Game,

802
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,119
there's a couple of rap songs
where he drops Cartoon's name.

803
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:52,830
<i>♪ I'm to hip-hop
What Cartoon is to Mexicans ♪</i>

804
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:56,184
You know, I'm a hip-hop fan,
and, so, I would see Cartoon

805
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,543
pop up in music videos.

806
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,717
<i>♪ From the reign of the tec
I break 'em off ♪</i>

807
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,428
<i>♪ I even got a tattoo
With your name across the chest ♪</i>

808
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,591
In the waiting room,

809
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:10,407
I remember looking
at the pictures on the wall,

810
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,141
pictures Estevan probably took.

811
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:15,186
Cartoon was tatting up all those,
50 Cent, Eminem and Dr. Dre.

812
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,271
If Xzibit was getting tattooed,

813
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,691
Estevan was photographing him,
and you'd see that photo everywhere.

814
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:26,030
I knew pretty early on
that he had done the Xs on Xzibit,

815
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,448
that he did 50 Cent's back,

816
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,825
You know, 50 got that shit
on his back, man.

817
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,202
That shit is crazy.

818
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,079
<i>♪ One, two, three, let's go! ♪</i>

819
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,974
<i>♪ Lil' mama, show me how you move it ♪</i>

820
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:38,167
<i>♪ Go ahead, put your back into it ♪</i>

821
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:42,463
More people were coming down,
more people were willing to come downtown.

822
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:46,634
I mean, back then, people used to complain
about having to drive to downtown.

823
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,886
"Oh, all the way downtown?"

824
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,555
They wouldn't go east of La Brea.

825
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,099
50 Cent, my boy Cartoon.

826
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,892
We out here in LA, boy.

827
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,228
Cartoon
was tattooing 50 Cent in there,

828
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:59,855
and he said he had to go have a meeting.

829
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:03,234
He was going to sign
with Jimmy Iovine at Interscope.

830
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,275
Huh? Huh?

831
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:06,320
So he had to leave
for an hour or two.

832
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:10,658
So me and Cartoon left
in his brand-new white Escalade

833
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,952
on, like, 22-inch rims.

834
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,832
About six police officers
followed us down that street.

835
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,667
They pulled us both out of the car.

836
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,545
They threw me on the ground,
put the handcuffs behind my back,

837
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:25,798
put his shotgun
in the back of my head right here,

838
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:27,007
and he was shaking.

839
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,342
What happened was...

840
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:30,428
Some motorcycle cop
was put in the hospital

841
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:34,598
by a young gentleman with a shaved head
looking a lot like me,

842
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,934
driving a truck like this.

843
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,812
We have customers here
from out of town.

844
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:42,314
And they go, "Hey,
you guys gotta go," then 50 Cent said...

845
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:45,818
I ain't did it. Cartoon ain't did it.
Leave us the fuck alone.

846
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,213
If you go on a talk show,
you have a big story to tell.

847
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,321
I get my tattoo done...

848
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:53,075
- That tattoo artist got-
- Yeah, on my back. And they're harassing.

849
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,159
We ain't going nowhere.

850
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,595
He's a friend of mine from Virginia,

851
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,722
but he's going to see this shit
and that's gonna be it.

852
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,707
<i>♪ To flip dough
To get more for sho' ♪</i>

853
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,560
<i>♪ Get my drink on
Then get on the dance floor ♪</i>

854
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:04,962
Did you ever get anybody, like, right
at this point, "Wait, I wanna change it"?

855
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:08,048
All you need now is, uh,
Mister Cartoon's signature.

856
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,676
What's up, y'all? It's Nas.

857
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:13,053
Chillin' up here with my man Cartoon.

858
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,781
Hey, yo, this is Meth right here.

859
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:18,350
I just got a tattoo done
by the world-famous Cartoon.

860
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,935
- Cartoon.
- Cartoon, baby.

861
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,688
What?

862
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,615
Cartoon is...

863
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:33,656
just an OG.

864
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,284
He's one of the illest.

865
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:38,370
Cartoon really made
black and gray popular again.

866
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:42,249
I'd sit down with Cartoon,
and we really wouldn't even have a plan.

867
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,293
I would trust him to just go freehand.

868
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:48,797
I had an appointment with Cartoon.
We all came to my spot in Corona.

869
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,674
We had just met,
but it felt, like, you know,

870
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,718
we had all been homies for a long time.

871
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,196
We got the kids with us,

872
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,100
we're taking the whole families,
Fourth of July.

873
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,599
The first tattoo
Cartoon did on me was

874
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,118
praying hands on the side of my head.

875
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:02,144
It said, "Barker," like my family name.

876
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,231
It was like therapy or something,
you know.

877
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:08,154
Just sitting with Toons, you don't even
realize you're getting tattooed.

878
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,320
I think the next tattoos he did

879
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:13,864
was he started filling in
my ghetto blaster.

880
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,075
He also did this Marilyn piece

881
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:18,494
right on my Adam's apple,
that one's a hard one.

882
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,829
Look at that shit.

883
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,249
My son was born,
and we were recording the new record,

884
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,792
and I'd decided that I wanted to get

885
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,875
my wife and son's name tattooed,
and Travis said...

886
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,688
"Then you gotta go to Cartoon,
he's the best."

887
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:32,550
And we were literally set up
on a road case in the living room

888
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,176
with all my bass equipment in it.

889
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,470
And I was nervous
about getting my first tattoos.

890
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,490
I remember just as he was
about to start, he said,

891
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:39,914
"Hey, man, I wanna give you props."

892
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,035
Being the first-class guy
you are, you picked

893
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,144
one of the more painful spots
to get tattooed.

894
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,940
And he started tattooing "Jack."

895
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,817
And about halfway through "Jack,"

896
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,069
I didn't know that the wife
was gonna happen at all.

897
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,880
These are still the only
tattoos that I have.

898
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,031
I don't know, being tattooed by Cartoon

899
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,992
kind of feels like you're
in an exclusive club?

900
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,202
Anybody who has Cartoon tats,

901
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,621
of any significance,
he's like... your brothers.

902
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,206
Now I'm brothers with 50 Cent,

903
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,250
Eminem, Beyoncé, and everybody else.

904
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:09,878
Cartoon is instrumental
in bringing his tattoo style

905
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:13,173
into the mainstream
for a really simple reason.

906
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,676
He's tattooing celebrities,

907
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,386
he's tattooing athletes.

908
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,929
Those people are photographed.

909
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,515
You see those tattoos.
Those people are everywhere.

910
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:25,227
I was lucky enough to go
to my first World Series and win it.

911
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:27,688
I wanted that to stay with me
for the rest of my life.

912
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:29,356
So I wanted Toons.

913
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,736
Being a tattoo artist,
our heroes were working out their kitchen

914
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:35,738
or their garage at their mom's house.

915
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:41,994
They hadn't been to really
a red-carpet level at that point.

916
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:44,413
There was some tattooers
that was higher than others

917
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:45,664
that we looked up to...

918
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:50,628
but it wasn't set up that that was
the jewelry of an NBA player.

919
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,380
- Kobe!
- Attacking. All the way!

920
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,633
Kobe did it!

921
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:58,427
Tattoos are a big thing in NBA.

922
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:01,305
I mean, not just in NBA,
but just in sports culture in general.

923
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,640
You know, I always said...

924
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,600
'Cause I had guys on the team
that had tattoos,

925
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:07,645
but they didn't go to Mister Cartoon,
and it becomes pretty apparent

926
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,968
because I can't read
what the fuck's on their arm anyway.

927
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:13,317
A lot of it is not
how good of a tattooer you are.

928
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,610
It's your timing

929
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:17,279
and who you surround yourself by.

930
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,823
You could be
the dopest motherfucker in the world,

931
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:23,118
but if no one sees your shit 'cause you're
in some small town somewhere,

932
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:24,995
that's not Hollywood.

933
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:29,249
We're right here in the mix of the shit.

934
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:36,924
I was in China.
We were staying at a hotel.

935
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,247
I went down to the weight room.

936
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,460
There was a young woman
working behind the desk, right?

937
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,720
They have a policy.

938
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:44,723
If you have tattoos on your arms,
you have to wear long sleeves.

939
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,183
I'm like, "What?"

940
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:48,686
She says, "I'm sorry,
you have to put on long sleeves."

941
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:49,937
And she goes,

942
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,180
"But that's Mister Cartoon, right?
He did the artwork."

943
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,334
I'm like, "Dude, how did you know
that's Mister Cartoon

944
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,794
but you know, I can't...?" You know.

945
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,028
But she knew that was
Mister Cartoon's artwork.

946
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:01,573
This is a young woman in Beijing.
It's so far removed from LA.

947
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:02,866
That's big.

948
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:05,244
Waiting on Paul Rosenberg...

949
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:07,830
manager of the stars,

950
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:09,581
Eminem.

951
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,876
Paul, being the person he is,

952
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,713
recognized Estevan
and his photography skills,

953
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:18,674
and Cartoon
with his art skills and packaging.

954
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:20,008
I certainly figured out

955
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,720
ways to maximize having access to them.

956
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,264
You know, everything,
from working with Eminem...

957
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:26,807
You see Big Lepke?

958
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:29,017
...and designing the Shady Records' logo.

959
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:35,774
When I was doing
the portrait of Eminem's daughter,

960
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:38,026
I knew it was big,
but I didn't know how.

961
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,236
You know what I'm saying?

962
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:42,489
You know, I wasn't looking
at the major impact

963
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:43,907
that it would have later.

964
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:46,160
I was just doing what was
in front of me.

965
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,205
<i>♪ Or even worse,
they can teach hate ♪</i>

966
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:51,498
<i>♪ It's like these kids ♪</i>

967
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,292
Eminem video shoot.

968
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,920
Waiting on doing some tattoos
on the homie.

969
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:01,592
They came to Detroit,
and he said, "We should do a mushroom."

970
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:04,094
He said... He was like,
"I can do a big-ass mushroom."

971
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:07,222
He did all... my whole sleeves.

972
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:10,350
I don't know, I got them removed
since then. I'm kidding.

973
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,936
I wanna get something like this over here,

974
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,039
but just... I wanna make sure
that it's the right shit

975
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,648
'cause tattoos are for life.

976
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,610
You know,
We could bust something out like your...

977
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:21,945
Your daughter's portrait.

978
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:25,199
Right here, I would probably
put something around this

979
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,742
to beefen it up a little bit.

980
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:27,785
Right.

981
00:46:27,786 --> 00:46:31,872
And maybe put another ribbon
and kind of tie it into the other side.

982
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,291
It's so crazy.

983
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:40,798
One of the things was Hailie.
I wanted to put her on my arm.

984
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,301
You should just outline...

985
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,845
My favorite rappers
were getting tattooed.

986
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,514
Like, that shit trips you out.

987
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,432
Let me put some bullet holes.

988
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:56,730
I remember being in the bathroom

989
00:46:56,814 --> 00:47:01,109
and I was tripping out
that I was the only person there

990
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,403
documenting Cartoon tattooing

991
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,240
the biggest artist in the world
at that time.

992
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:17,000
<i>- ♪ That's why ♪
- ♪ They call me Slim Shady ♪</i>

993
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:22,422
I remember, man,
I'm getting those shots

994
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:26,093
of the greatest of all times
in our lifetime,

995
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:29,721
like the number one celebrity, artist,

996
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,348
anything in the world.

997
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:33,225
And I was there documenting it,

998
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:34,726
I wished, I remember, like,

999
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,479
kind of like smiling in the mirror,
like I was happy.

1000
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:40,065
I got a question I wanna ask you.

1001
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:43,777
How many people are sick...

1002
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:49,157
of motherfuckers talking shit about me?

1003
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,872
And it was a cool feeling,
you know?

1004
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:58,041
It made me, like, think of all the times
when there was, like,

1005
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,752
a picture of Elvis Presley
getting his hair cut

1006
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:03,005
and it's just him and the barber.

1007
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:06,800
Damn, that photographer
had some crazy-ass access, you know?

1008
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,552
Oh, yeah, get one of those too.

1009
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,195
You have to put that shit on your back.

1010
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,934
Cartoon. Big Cartoon.

1011
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,311
Call him Big Cartoon now.

1012
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,645
Guy's good, man.

1013
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:19,855
He's pretty decent.

1014
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:25,193
Estevan's eye for seeing
what angle to shoot something...

1015
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,364
how to bring someone's best look
out of them.

1016
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:33,953
A lot of other photographers,
that's what they don't understand.

1017
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:36,705
They don't know
how to make someone look good.

1018
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,918
George Lopez!

1019
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,815
When I got my star
in the Walk of Fame, Estevan came over

1020
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,591
and took
this fucking amazing picture of me

1021
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:49,009
surrounded by the fans,

1022
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,303
and thousands of people,
maybe a couple thousand people.

1023
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:53,388
And to get that,

1024
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:55,766
of me and my suit, of me with the flag,

1025
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:57,768
of me surrounded by, you know,

1026
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:01,355
other Latinos right there
on Hollywood Boulevard was... It was great.

1027
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:09,168
Same thing, that's why
he gets a lot of jobs in hip-hop.

1028
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,240
'Cause he knows hip-hop.

1029
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,327
Grew up in that shit.

1030
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,789
So it's better for someone from the inside

1031
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:21,500
to shoot the outside, you know?

1032
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:28,298
On my <i>Ego Trippin'</i> cover, me and Estevan,

1033
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,884
we went back to my old high school,
Poly High School,

1034
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:34,346
got an old B210
like I used to have in high school,

1035
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:35,889
had on my Letterman jacket,

1036
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,891
and it just felt like
I was in high school.

1037
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:38,976
That shit was hard.

1038
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:42,104
But only he could capture what I wanted.

1039
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,982
This is an era
when Dogg didn't have money.

1040
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,566
He understood that.

1041
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:50,237
Shoot Snoop Doggy Dogg.
Snoop Doggy fizzle fizzle.

1042
00:49:56,743 --> 00:50:00,789
If Estevan did your album cover,
Cartoon was doing the artwork.

1043
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:04,042
Some people try to do
everything by themselves.

1044
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:06,837
We just did different ends of the table.

1045
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,548
He covered photography

1046
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:12,592
while I would do the logo,
I would draw the concept.

1047
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:32,237
I've seen this, when they're snapping
400 pictures to get some shit,

1048
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,031
and I've seen this guy walk out...

1049
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:36,742
Bam.

1050
00:50:36,743 --> 00:50:38,201
Stand against that wall. Click.

1051
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,162
And then you see it,
it could be an album cover

1052
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:41,955
or, like, the cover of a magazine.

1053
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:53,418
You feel like you're being directed,
like you're in the hands of the director.

1054
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,927
I love it when a director
knows exactly what he wants

1055
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:58,096
and he says, "Look, this is what I want."

1056
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:02,267
Okay, cool. You got hired to direct me,
I got hired to act.

1057
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:07,981
I was around lowriders and gangsters,
and I was around hip-hop.

1058
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,900
With both of those comes girls.

1059
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,235
LA culture.

1060
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:15,405
Like, I get Estevan's book. Wow.

1061
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:26,249
I always thought my dad's work
was very inspiring.

1062
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:31,004
For girls, like, he just captures beauty,
like, so perfectly.

1063
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:37,135
A lot of the art too
comes from jail,

1064
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,387
where guys are sitting in a cell

1065
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:41,681
and fantasizing about their girl.

1066
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:43,517
I always looked at it

1067
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,436
as really uplifting women.

1068
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,189
They may not have any clothes on,
or they'd be topless.

1069
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:52,776
I think as an artist,
I always looked at the beauty of it,

1070
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:55,237
but knowing who to shoot,

1071
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:58,281
where to shoot, when to shoot,

1072
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,659
you look at that, you're like,
"That shit's real."

1073
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:03,054
<i>If I wasn't shooting LA culture,</i>

1074
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:05,831
<i>I was going on tour
with bands like Blink-182,</i>

1075
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,874
<i>only I wasn't a road manager anymore.</i>

1076
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:12,170
Right about the time we went
on that tour to Iraq and Europe,

1077
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:14,506
touring was, like, more fun
when you brought friends.

1078
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,467
Having Estevan out there was so fun.

1079
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:20,178
It is freezing like a motherfucker
in Paris.

1080
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:23,348
The tour
that Estevan came with us in Europe

1081
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:26,393
was a very difficult time

1082
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:27,811
in Blink's history.

1083
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:29,271
We were arguing...

1084
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:31,565
the entire tour.

1085
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,859
Leave me fucking be! I'm fucking tired!

1086
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:43,136
- How was that?
- It was the shit.

1087
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,960
- That was fun, right?
- Hell, yeah.

1088
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:50,375
The last show that we played
before the band broke up the first time,

1089
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:52,709
we finished the last note,
and I thought to myself,

1090
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:56,006
"This is probably gonna be the last show.
This feels like the end of something."

1091
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:58,175
And Estevan came on stage and said,

1092
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,194
"Hey, I wanna get
a shot of the three of you guys."

1093
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:01,970
And it's actually
on our <i>Greatest Hits</i> album

1094
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:03,221
that came out after that.

1095
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:07,517
It goes back to Estevan's ethos

1096
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,644
of putting himself in these situations

1097
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:13,356
where he is able to document things
that are happening with other people.

1098
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:28,496
The United States and our allies
have prevailed.

1099
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,876
Estevan came with us
when we went overseas

1100
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:35,629
to the Middle East
to meet and perform for the troops.

1101
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:40,133
When we got to Iraq, everyone
was kind of shook about going there

1102
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:41,509
'cause the war had just started.

1103
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,386
I don't have any idea what to expect.

1104
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,110
I'm just going in,
having this adventure.

1105
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:46,348
It's really cool.

1106
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:47,974
It was scary,

1107
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:49,976
it was hot, it was dusty.

1108
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,395
It was like five or six days

1109
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,731
of being transported
to an entirely different world.

1110
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:56,066
It's like a movie.

1111
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:57,817
We were on a nuclear submarine

1112
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:01,238
literally crawling in the torpedo tubes.

1113
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:06,534
So that whole trip was fireworks.
It was scary as fuck.

1114
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:08,411
It was definitely
an eye-opening experience.

1115
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:09,788
Travis, what's your job, Travis?

1116
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:11,974
- I play the drums.
- Drummer, all right. How are you?

1117
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:13,667
Don't hit the torpedo buttons.

1118
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,851
You fire torpedoes? You shot one?

1119
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:17,337
- I shot one.
- Cool.

1120
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:21,508
We were in a marine forward base
on the border of Iraq.

1121
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:24,094
We got Blink-182 in the house!

1122
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,532
- Don't turn the key on.
- I won't.

1123
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:30,225
I guess things were getting heated,

1124
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,269
so we took a COD plane

1125
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,728
that boomeranged us

1126
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:35,981
off of the aircraft carrier.

1127
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:38,464
But it was insane.
I was really glad that he was there

1128
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:39,734
to get those photos.

1129
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:50,662
As a lot of photographers
were breaking into digital photography,

1130
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:53,206
Estevan stuck to film

1131
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,292
and the development process.

1132
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:57,502
Because it's grainy
and it looks like film,

1133
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:59,963
it's a document of one specific moment.

1134
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:02,716
Before you know it, you know,
Estevan was doing more directing.

1135
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,926
Started to do mad videos for everybody.

1136
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:07,387
<i>♪ Hold you down ♪</i>

1137
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:12,058
Estevan did
the first D12 video we ever shot.

1138
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:15,645
It was supposed to be
a gritty, grimy-looking video,

1139
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:18,231
and Estevan captured that perfectly.

1140
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:22,944
I know we shot the outside of the house,
the Dresden house,

1141
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:25,989
but I'm pretty sure we shot
the inside of it too.

1142
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:27,592
I'm like, "Yeah, that's the bathroom."

1143
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:33,747
It wasn't really a lot of fun
dressing up...

1144
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,082
like Richard Simmons.

1145
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,585
But, hey, man, at that point in time,

1146
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,462
I was doing whatever it took.

1147
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:42,630
He directed a couple of Cypress videos.

1148
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:44,716
<i>♪ Hello, my name is Dr. Greenthumb ♪</i>

1149
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:47,052
<i>♪ Hello, my name is Dr. Greenthumb ♪</i>

1150
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:48,295
<i>♪ I'd like to tell you... ♪</i>

1151
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:51,598
You know, we had the same ideas,
we grew up in the same part of the planet,

1152
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:54,059
so it wasn't hard for him to know
what we were gonna like

1153
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:55,703
and what we wanted to see in our videos.

1154
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:58,063
<i>♪ Hello, my name is Dr. Greenthumb ♪</i>

1155
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:00,774
And then, when we went down
to Mexico City, in DF,

1156
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:03,818
we had thousands and thousands
of kids following us

1157
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:04,944
on the street that day,

1158
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,154
and in the midst of it all,

1159
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:08,740
Estevan was on point
the whole time with the camera, you know.

1160
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:11,117
<i>♪ Here is something
you can't understand ♪</i>

1161
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,161
He understood
what made a good story

1162
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:15,455
and he understood what was authentic.

1163
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:20,584
I like that.

1164
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,670
I'll tell you when,
just keep the light on him

1165
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:24,214
so when I sweep back around...

1166
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:26,132
<i>With this video, it was an idea</i>

1167
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:29,135
<i>that was thought out by the director,
Estevan Oriol.</i>

1168
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,888
He directed this video
that really shook everything up.

1169
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:33,932
It was really like, "What in the world?"

1170
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,683
Like it's the real deal.

1171
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:39,229
Having him come in
and direct a video for us

1172
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:41,689
just, I don't know,
brought a really element of cool

1173
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:43,453
that I think was really ahead of its time.

1174
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:47,612
That shit was, like, really amazing.
Just the way he... His style.

1175
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:51,991
The "Down" video was fun.
It was the first time I ever met Trigz.

1176
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:56,287
It was I think the first time
we ever brought Mark and Tom to the hood.

1177
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:58,411
I think they were tripping a little bit.

1178
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:02,001
He put me in the Blink-182 video.

1179
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,043
As a cop.

1180
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:04,922
What I loved was the authenticity.

1181
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:07,924
Here was an example of the culture

1182
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:09,801
needing another voice.

1183
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:11,636
Here I was this cop after this guy,

1184
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:13,596
he's on the run,
and there was a helicopter.

1185
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,640
You know, shot in the LA Basin and...

1186
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:17,517
There were people in the video

1187
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,561
that looked like for real LA.

1188
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:24,065
But that was fun, man,
that video came out so cool and it had...

1189
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:27,026
just a different energy
than anything we ever did and...

1190
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,863
Estevan just really killed the visual.

1191
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:46,337
You ready?
Let's set up the shot.

1192
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,101
Are you gonna sit on the chair?

1193
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,859
- Can I direct?
- Yes, sir.

1194
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:51,569
Don't follow me.
You're gonna be on the shot.

1195
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:54,321
- Tell me what you're gonna do.
- I'm gonna make a documentary

1196
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:55,865
and talk about the Sixth Street Bridge.

1197
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,348
- Ready?
- Yes.

1198
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:59,476
Okay, so, we're sitting right here

1199
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:02,729
at what was formerly known
as the Sixth Street Bridge.

1200
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:04,981
So you see these pieces right here?

1201
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:08,860
There was two arches.
They were part of the bridge.

1202
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:10,028
That's them now.

1203
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,364
I have 20 years of photos

1204
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,158
of this street

1205
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:17,660
and where this bridge was,
and that bridge.

1206
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,037
And they're gonna redo it.

1207
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,247
They're gonna have a poodle park here,

1208
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:23,541
a cappuccino bar, a juice bar.

1209
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,376
This whole area is changing.

1210
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:32,842
This was the access way
to the LA River.

1211
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,512
And this was like our playground,
our stomping ground.

1212
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:39,015
I had a lot of good photo shoots here,
a lot of good times.

1213

Get it out of the street.

1214
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:44,020

gangsters, and lowriders,

00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:46,064

Gettin' it on... ♪</i>

1231
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:32,110
He caught it first.
A lot of the photographers

1232
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:36,573
didn't know some of that type
of finger lingo, if you will, you know,

1233
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:38,408
when you throw up the West Coast

1234
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:40,910
or you throw up LA,
whatever clique you're from.

1235
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:43,204
A lot of people
didn't wanna use that photo.

1236
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:45,039
They said it was too gang-related.

1237
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:46,541
At that time,

1238
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:49,210
if the wrong person saw you doing that,

1239
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:52,088
you'd get beat up,
or shot at or fucking stabbed.

1240
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:53,649
Throwing up the L and the A like that,

1241
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:55,513
that was something that we did
back in the day.

1242
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:58,428
And that was
the first representation of it.

1243
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:01,014
Now it's a global thing
where kids in other countries

1244
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,391
send me pictures of them
throwing up that sign.

1245
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:05,202
That's pretty cool, man.
You know what I mean?

1246
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:06,644
His LA hands photo?

1247
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:07,728
That's Estevan.

1248
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:10,273
That shit's been copied so much.

1249
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,650
So many times. Ripped off.

1250
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:14,277
Many have tried to bite it.

1251
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,863
I see the LA hands,
and I know it's a bootleg.

1252
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:18,948
Starbucks is ripping him off. Gosh!

1253
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,199
The H&M thing?

1254
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,785
To steal from artists like that,
their images.

1255
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,037
They have it on T-shirts.

1256
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,914
The LA symbol's notorious.

1257
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:29,667
Everybody, you know,
and their mom, was doing it.

1258
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,919
- The Mayor's throwing it up.
- Boom!

1259
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:35,590
People gonna copy it, people gonna try it,
but we all know where it came from.

1260
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:39,469
I advise everybody to dig into the roots
of anything they do

1261
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:42,930
and see where it came from
and pay homage to the person before them.

1262
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:45,767
It was iconic.
It's an iconic picture.

1263
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:52,899
One of the things
that is there with Chicano art

1264
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:54,192
is violence,

1265
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:55,985
is poverty,

1266
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,820
is addiction,

1267
01:00:58,404 --> 01:00:59,822
alcoholism.

1268
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:08,247
When I met Estevan, I was
struggling through a lot of relapses.

1269
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:12,168
We were in a motel, and I called Estevan.
I go, "Hey, I'm on a good one, man.

1270
01:01:12,251 --> 01:01:14,563
You wanna film some footage?
So why don't you come on through,

1271
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:16,839
because we got it going on
real good right here."

1272
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:19,676
I had every drug in my system,
'cause I don't discriminate.

1273
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:21,469
I just went on a binge.

1274
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:23,971
A simple binge.
Everybody does it once in a while.

1275
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:27,225
You know, some people binge on donuts.
Some people binge on heroin.

1276
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,478
This is some new shit I came across.

1277
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:33,481
These are five-dollar <i>bolsas.</i>

1278
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:35,149
I love it. There's no excuse.

1279
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:37,860
I love to get high on this.
I love the feeling I get from it.

1280
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:42,615
If you don't cook it right,
it fucks your stomach good.

1281
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,498
This is the picture they took
of the heroin

1282
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:53,626
that wasn't getting me high no more
with the syringe, the crack pipe,

1283
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,962
and I don't know
why I had the nail clipper there.

1284
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:57,255
God only knows, right?

1285
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:03,302
Estevan could take me into the lab

1286
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:05,513
and pull out all these pictures
and I'll go,

1287
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:08,474
"What the fuck? Are you serious, bro?"

1288
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:15,022
I looked like
an Ethiopian research monkey.

1289
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:19,485
I don't even know why I'm alive today.

1290
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:22,029
For some good reason,
the good Lord didn't drop me

1291
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:23,406
and put me on my back.

1292
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:25,700
Sometimes, I sell real shit. Sometimes...

1293
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:29,036
And I was in a bad stage right here.

1294
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:31,497
And those are balloons of heroin
in my mouth.

1295
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:33,666
I sell fake shit. All this is fake.

1296
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:34,708
This is all fake.

1297
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:36,753
Either way, this is getting sold,
all right?

1298
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:39,088
Because, see,
you can't buy drugs on the street.

1299
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:41,340
That's illegal.
You can't sell them. It's illegal.

1300
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,634
There's no drugs in here.
So it's a bungle case.

1301
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:46,095
So the proof is in the pudding,
ladies and gentlemen.

1302
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:48,449
If you wanna know
the real street culture

1303
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:51,058
and that street life,
open one of Estevan's books.

1304
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:54,270
And this is where it leads to.
Everything leads to this picture.

1305
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:56,647
This is 2003,

1306
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:58,983
July 9th or 8th, I believe.

1307
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:02,403
I got shot
in front of the Econo Lodge hotel.

1308
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:05,490
From where you're at, from where
the camera's at, they shot me six times.

1309
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:06,925
I took five bullets there.

1310
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,910
And they came and told me
I didn't have insurance,

1311
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:12,079
so five days after that, I walked out,
caught walking pneumonia, almost died,

1312
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:15,124
and then went back and had to stay
another additional 30 days.

1313
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:18,294
See? Karma hits, 'cause I was supposed
to be doing Estevan a favor

1314
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:19,377
and moving somebody.

1315
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:20,671
See how that works?

1316
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,549
The '90s were very, very violent.

1317
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:26,135
You saw the peak of gang violence.

1318
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:30,097
You saw people that were there
that seen enemies they didn't like,

1319
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:31,974
they just took off on them right there.

1320
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:34,560
You could hear the bullets going by.

1321
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:38,540
They were trying to stop here, homie.
They were coming too fast.

1322
01:03:38,564 --> 01:03:41,901
So they stopped right here.
And they went just like, "Hey, homie."

1323
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:44,070
Man!

1324
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:45,530
I hit the floor quick, eh.

1325
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:47,174
Why were they shooting at you?

1326
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:48,967
See, this is a black neighborhood, right?

1327
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:51,702
I guess they're going at it
with a Hispanic gang over there.

1328
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:53,765
You know what I mean? Look at me, dog.

1329
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:57,291
- Look right here, homie.
- Yeah.

one of my fans gave me the name.

1352
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:48,777
In there,
the tattoo shop is your cell.

1353
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:51,470
Just a couple of cases of soups
and coffee, man, from prison.

1354
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:54,432
That's what they charge you in there
to do this type of thing.

1355
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:57,602
Nowadays I guess that's just
a way to look cool, but...

1356
01:04:57,685 --> 01:04:59,020
All these tattoos right here?

1357
01:04:59,103 --> 01:05:00,479
They were basically earned,

1358
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,940
they were basically put on me
for a reason.

1359
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:05,818
All my tattoos
were done in prison, single needle.

1360
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:07,236
Never got tattooed in a shop.

1361
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:11,198
They were kind of like the old black
and gray feel to the ink.

<i>♪ Don't make me

1363

Some tattoos that some people have,
they put them on

1364
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:19,206
because maybe they were in a lifestyle
where a life was lost.

1365
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:21,167
Not to say that they took the life,

1366
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,450
because we're not gonna say that
'cause we're on camera.

1367
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:27,048
When I sleeve somebody,
they can't go into regular society,

1368
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:30,259
but little by little,
those people will be business owners.

1369
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:33,780
You know, over the next 10, 20 years,
those people that are getting sleeves

1370
01:05:33,804 --> 01:05:36,474
will be business owners
and shit will change up for them.

1371
01:05:37,224 --> 01:05:40,853
That's okay. It's a trend now.
We got the soccer moms putting tattoos on.

1372
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:43,064
They're doing shit
that we were looked down on.

1373
01:05:43,147 --> 01:05:45,691
We were putting these tattoos
'cause we were outcasts,

1374
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:48,152
because society rejected us.

1375
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:51,113
Now they're putting them on
because now society accepts it?

1376
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:53,783
So now I might just start
taking them all off.

1377
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:59,205
We're interested
in the darkest shit in life.

1378
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:01,374
Ghetto bird in the sky...

1379
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:04,919
homeless shit and drug addicts.

1380
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:08,631
Watching and observing those cultures,
you know what I mean?

1381
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,884
What happened to your hand?
You got arthritis?

1382
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:14,387
No, I... My ex-boyfriend broke it.

1383
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:15,471
Oh, okay.

1384
01:06:15,554 --> 01:06:18,391
Okay, look, if you go out this way,
and go on the side,

1385
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:21,435
go straight all the way down,
there's a little alley right there.

1386
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:22,895
I'll go check it out.

1387
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:24,740
- Take it easy.
- Bye, thank you.

1388
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:28,567
When you're in the streets
in LA, in the bad neighborhoods,

1389
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:30,319
it's like your blood is flowing,

1390
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:32,738
the adrenaline is there.

1391
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:37,326
When you know that it's an active area
and some shit might happen,

1392
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:40,997
it's kind of like, okay, cool, you know,
you gotta be on point, you know.

1393
01:06:41,205 --> 01:06:43,165
Open the eyes on the back of your head,

1394
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:46,377
'cause if you're just walking around
all "ladi da, da,"

1395
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:48,380
you know, like an idiot,
you could lose that way.

1396
01:06:48,462 --> 01:06:50,798
They're just looking
for someone to fuck with, so...

1397
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:52,550
Right here, you know what I'm saying?

1398
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:54,468
Just gotta make sure you're strapped.

1399
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:57,513
A lot of people we've known have died.

1400
01:06:58,597 --> 01:07:00,437
Can't even think of how that would be

1401
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:01,976
if Cartoon passed away.

1402
01:07:08,065 --> 01:07:10,192
We've had to make out wills before,

1403
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:13,029
and it was, like,
the will went to, like, each other.

1404
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:15,281
We would look out for each other's family.

1405
01:07:16,615 --> 01:07:19,535
Let's see what we have here
in this little box.

1406
01:07:20,661 --> 01:07:23,956
This is my friend Mono. He passed away.

1407
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:28,210
He's the guy that introduced me
and my wife to each other.

1408
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:29,252
Oh, yeah?

1409
01:07:29,253 --> 01:07:31,255
And he introduced Cartoon to his wife.

1410
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:35,760
Right here, this is one
of my favorite pictures of all times.

1411
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:37,219
His name was Chato.

1412
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:38,929
Rest in peace. He died.

1413
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:40,723
Trigz got shot.

1414
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:44,643
He got murdered
'cause he got into a fight with somebody.

1415
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:46,312
Rest in peace.

1416
01:07:46,979 --> 01:07:49,482
This was another guy that was shot.
His name was Nene.

1417
01:07:50,816 --> 01:07:53,360
I think he got shot 33 times.

1418
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:55,738
- What happened to him?
- He died.

1419
01:07:56,989 --> 01:07:59,134
You know, I think they're living
the life they wanted to

1420
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:01,452
and they died doing what they loved doing.

1421
01:08:01,535 --> 01:08:05,039
Those guys were gangsters
and they died doing some gangster shit.

1422
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:07,750
So you think they kind
of dig being a gangster.

1423
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:08,833
They'd rather do that...

1424
01:08:08,876 --> 01:08:11,396
Yeah, they loved it, or else
they wouldn't have been a gangster.

That violence, that poverty,

1449
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:00,321
that madness,

1450
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:02,573
spawned a beautiful art form

1451
01:10:02,656 --> 01:10:04,366
of music, and tattoos,

1452
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:06,368
and wall murals,

1453
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:08,954
pinstripe, and gold leaf.

1454
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:12,416
Those guys sitting in cells
that will never get out

1455
01:10:12,499 --> 01:10:15,377
helped shape an art form,

1456
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:18,172
this rose out of a crack in the concrete.

1457
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:21,842
Now you have a new wave of Chicano artists

1458
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:24,261
that can focus on Chicano pride.

1459
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:27,806
To be Chicano
means identifying with your roots.

1460
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:29,743
The number one thing
is family.

1461
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:30,767
It's all about family.

1462
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:35,397
<i>♪ I want to hold you ♪</i>

1463
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:37,983
<i>♪ Squeeze you... ♪</i>

1464
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:40,945
You don't really hear
about the heart of a Chicano,

1465
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,364
but you can see it in a lowrider.

1466
01:10:43,447 --> 01:10:44,990
The way we build our cars,

1467
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:48,118
they're old Benny's thrown away
that we pick up and we shine.

1468
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:51,330
It's almost like watching
a Chicano's heart

1469
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:53,540
being poured out onto paint

1470
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:56,877
and coating a vehicle with love, you know?

1471
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:01,483
Those people that threw them away
wish they had them back

1472
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:04,426
after they see them all fixed up
and clean and shined up.

1473
01:11:04,885 --> 01:11:07,263
You don't own a lowrider.
You are a lowrider.

1474
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:10,182
Promoting a great culture in America.

1475
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:13,143
There are people
that are incredibly wealthy

1476
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:16,146
that actually know the culture

1477
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:18,691
and are admirers of the culture.

1478
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:21,068
The culture grew to places

1479
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:22,444
like Japan, Europe,

1480
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:23,779
South America.

1481
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:26,448
They introduced
the whole rest of the world basically

1482
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:28,325
to the East LA esthetic.

1483
01:11:34,665 --> 01:11:37,751
You go to Japan
and you see some of the Japanese kids

1484
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:39,586
dressing like cholos.

1485
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,171
To the T.

1486
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:43,048
You would think, they could put on glasses

1487
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:46,468
and have the whole thing
and they could look all "Chicanoed-out"

1488
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,470
until they started to speak.

1489
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:50,222
Sheeba city ghetto family.

1490
01:11:52,224 --> 01:11:54,476
Asian culture has become obsessed

1491
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,895
with East LA and lowriding.

1492
01:11:56,979 --> 01:12:00,357
There's a big lowrider scene
that's gone around the world.

1493
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:06,530
Because of what Cartoon
and Estevan did with Chicano culture

1494
01:12:06,613 --> 01:12:11,201
and made it so pervasive
and popular in Japanese subculture,

1495
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:15,205
it made it even extra cool
back here in the States.

1496
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:19,126
And I think a lot of it comes
from how pioneering these two gentlemen

1497
01:12:19,209 --> 01:12:20,669
have been to the culture.

1498
01:12:21,211 --> 01:12:26,258
We listen to oldies,
we listen to Motown-style, classic soul.

1499
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:36,352
Due to the weather on the West Coast,
we wear T-shirts all year long.

1500
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:38,479
We invented the white tee,

1501
01:12:38,562 --> 01:12:39,897
khakis and Dickies,

1502
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:41,106
that whole look.

1503
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:44,360
The West Coast grew up
wearing Cortez shoes.

1504
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:47,237
This is the staple for the West Coast.

1505
01:12:47,571 --> 01:12:49,990
In the '80s, though,
it was like a gang-banging shoe.

1506
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:52,754
Like, you wearing that shoe,
people asked you, "Where are you from?"

1507
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:57,581
I had meditated why it was relevant,

1508
01:12:57,664 --> 01:12:59,458
and why it had to be done.

1509
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:01,377
My own Nike, period.

1510
01:13:01,835 --> 01:13:03,462
And once I got them in,

1511
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:04,922
it was time to drop,

1512
01:13:05,005 --> 01:13:06,256
"I have to do a Cortez,"

1513
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:08,384
paying homage to that era,

1514
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:10,344
to the NWA era.

1515
01:13:10,969 --> 01:13:12,262
When that happened,

1516
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:15,224
I was like, "Man, this is fucking amazing.

1517
01:13:15,307 --> 01:13:18,560
I'm gonna design the shoe
I grew up wearing."

1518
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:21,855
It'd be like McDonald's calling you,
and be like,

1519
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:24,191
"You're gonna do
your own signature Big Mac.

1520
01:13:24,274 --> 01:13:25,190
Get ready."

1521
01:13:25,192 --> 01:13:27,152
Nike is doing a Mister Cartoon shoe?

1522
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:28,654
They're giving you a shoe?

1523
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:30,114
And letting you design it?

1524
01:13:30,197 --> 01:13:31,281
It's... It's crazy.

1525
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:34,076
There's not a lot of artists out here
to have their own Nike shoe.

1526
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:37,329
I walk into a business meeting
with confidence.

1527
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:40,499
I walk in like, "I'm... The boss is here."

1528
01:13:40,999 --> 01:13:43,335
And you convince the client

1529
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:45,170
that you know what's poppin'.

1530
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:47,589
This is inspiring to me.

1531
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:51,135
I can apply that same philosophy
to what I'm doing.

1532
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:52,636
My homie did it, I can do it.

1533
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:53,846
Oh, wow.

1534
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:57,641
Whoa, Mister Cartoon is completely
crossing over to a different level,

1535
01:13:57,724 --> 01:13:58,640
you know?

1536
01:13:58,642 --> 01:14:01,520
I did the LA edition,
which was putting the "LA"

1537
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:03,772
and having the Nike check go through it.

1538
01:14:04,022 --> 01:14:06,608
The next one I did was the Aztec.

1539
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:10,112
This was crazy
because here I'm doing an Aztec

1540
01:14:10,195 --> 01:14:11,238
on a Cortez.

1541
01:14:11,321 --> 01:14:16,243
So you have the Spaniards
coming to New Spain, which was Mexico,

1542
01:14:16,326 --> 01:14:17,995
to bring disease,

1543
01:14:18,078 --> 01:14:21,623
great war between the Spaniards
and the Aztecs

1544
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:24,585
to create Mexican people.

1545
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:27,796
So, I had that on a shoe,
which is a little heavy,

1546
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,798
you know what I'm saying?
For a shoe design.

1547
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:34,094
And then on the Aztec warrior,
I put a brush mustache,

1548
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:37,181
which is representative of the homies now.

1549
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,892
When it finally went through,

1550
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:41,602
I was blown away.

1551
01:14:41,685 --> 01:14:45,397
I'm surprised every time
one of these huge deals goes through.

1552
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,232
So, to balance that,

1553
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:49,610
it was important that I did outreach.

1554
01:14:50,235 --> 01:14:53,489
Talking to youngsters, explaining to them,

1555
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:56,033
"Look, I went to LA Unified School,

1556
01:14:56,116 --> 01:14:57,493
and I designed my own shoe.

1557
01:14:57,576 --> 01:14:59,203
What would your shoe look like?"

1558
01:14:59,286 --> 01:15:01,872
And I would ask these kids,
and they'd get all shy.

1559
01:15:01,955 --> 01:15:04,750
It's beautiful to see
that Cartoon can set an example

1560
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:05,918
for these young kids,

1561
01:15:06,126 --> 01:15:08,212
giving kids hope in art.

1562
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:11,632
My goal was to motivate them
and get them to think,

1563
01:15:11,715 --> 01:15:15,135
"Man, if this knucklehead can do it,
man, I can design my own shoe."

1564
01:15:20,974 --> 01:15:22,059
What?

1565
01:15:22,142 --> 01:15:24,561
Motherfucking premiere of Machete.

1566
01:15:24,645 --> 01:15:27,231
Yeah, that was sweet, with the lowriders.

1567
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:30,108
Seeing these big Hollywood events.

1568
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:32,236
In the back on my mind, I was like,

1569
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:34,279
"We can get a team together and do it."

1570
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:35,363
We had the budgets.

1571
01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:37,241
And we were able to have some power

1572
01:15:37,824 --> 01:15:40,577
to do some of those events,
and it came out dope.

1573
01:15:40,661 --> 01:15:41,954
And it was beautiful, man.

1574
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:45,123
People in the street,
happy that somebody's representing.

1575
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:47,292
This is a historical moment right here.

1576
01:15:48,835 --> 01:15:50,546
We're taking our culture

1577
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:51,838
and trying to lift it up.

1578
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:55,092
It would be hard
to be downtown that day

1579
01:15:55,175 --> 01:15:56,593
and not feel our presence.

1580
01:15:56,677 --> 01:15:58,512
We here.

1581
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,056
Damn, man,
we're bringing Chicano art

1582
01:16:01,139 --> 01:16:03,058
into places that it's never been before.

1583
01:16:04,434 --> 01:16:07,729
Shout-out to S.A. Studios.
Grand Theft Auto, good looking.

1584
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:12,401
<i>GTA</i> is the iconic video game that ended up
becoming because of the Estev and Toon.

1585
01:16:12,484 --> 01:16:14,278
I played Cesar Vialpando.

1586
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:17,823
We did
all the tattoos, graffiti,

1587
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,366
murals,

1588
01:16:19,449 --> 01:16:20,492
liquor store,

1589
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:23,370
and the Virgen de Guadalupe
would be on the side.

1590
01:16:23,453 --> 01:16:25,122
Estevan would take them around

1591
01:16:25,205 --> 01:16:26,498
to all the sick shit

1592
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:28,375
and fucking recreate that.

1593
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:31,336
You've been on a trajectory

1594
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:33,338
from the bottom-bottom,

1595
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:35,215
and I guess prison, possibly.

1596
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:38,093
You got out of that, survived that,

1597
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:42,514
and you're on this uphill trajectory
of perfecting this art form.

1598
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:45,851
It was a great time.
Record businesses were still going.

1599
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:47,811
And magazines were popping

1600
01:16:47,894 --> 01:16:52,649
and commercials were getting
anywhere from 100,000 into the millions.

1601
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:54,443
Then the digital age came.

1602
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:56,695
It's over, and the Internet has allowed

1603
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:59,031
global communication
with a lot of people...

1604
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:01,575
Twenty million people
get their music this way.

1605
01:17:01,658 --> 01:17:04,161
- They worst offender is Napster.
- Metallica filed a...

1606
01:17:04,244 --> 01:17:08,123
At that point, S.A. Studios,
it was kind of like a barber shop.

1607
01:17:08,206 --> 01:17:11,043
People came by afterward and bullshitted.

1608
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:16,465
That's what S.A. Studios felt like.
A bunch of big-ass kids having fun.

1609
01:17:16,548 --> 01:17:17,758
"What's up, homie?

1610
01:17:17,841 --> 01:17:20,218
What you doing, man?
What you've been up to?"

1611
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:22,346
It'd be like showing up
at a doctor's office.

1612
01:17:22,429 --> 01:17:23,930
You're like, "What's up, fool?

1613
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:26,642
Yay, man. Wow, you're doing
some surgery. What's up?"

1614
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:28,560
Working on the ice-cream truck.

1615
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,538
I'm gonna stay here
until five, six in the morning.

1616
01:17:30,562 --> 01:17:32,040
I'll probably just go crash upstairs.

1617
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:34,358
A little bit overwhelming for me.

1618
01:17:34,441 --> 01:17:37,402
I don't need a lot of people around
to do what I do.

1619
01:17:37,861 --> 01:17:39,029
They're changing.

1620
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:42,074
Life's about change.

1621
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:44,967
After a rare week of gains...

1622
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:46,995
Worst one-day losses since 911.

1623
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:48,538
The stock market fell hard...

1624
01:17:48,622 --> 01:17:49,915
533,000...

1625
01:17:49,998 --> 01:17:51,917
Two point six million people...

1626
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,711
In 2008 there was the depression.

1627
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:57,297
The country just fell apart.

1628
01:17:57,381 --> 01:17:59,841
Spinning the economy
in a vicious cycle,

1629
01:17:59,925 --> 01:18:01,218
people losing their jobs,

1630
01:18:01,301 --> 01:18:03,637
then falling behind on their mortgages.

1631
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:06,556
Magazines shut down,
record labels shut down.

1632
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,743
President Obama facing increasing pressure

1633
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:10,102
for a new stimulus package.

1634
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:11,770
All the budgets went away.

1635
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:14,231
Eleven point three trillion dollars.

1636
01:18:14,314 --> 01:18:16,149
...to stabilize the housing market,

1637
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:18,860
and help responsible home-owners
stay in their homes.

1638
01:18:18,985 --> 01:18:23,281
That cut at least 75% of my work
that was coming in.

1639
01:18:23,865 --> 01:18:26,201
S.A. Studios was a certain time.

1640
01:18:26,284 --> 01:18:29,204
Everything evolves,
and everything is a moment in time.

1641
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:34,251
That whole place of downtown LA
got over-gentrified in my opinion.

1642
01:18:34,626 --> 01:18:36,378
It became uncool.

1643
01:18:36,461 --> 01:18:38,463
It became very corporate.

1644
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,425
If everything always
stays the same, how special is it?

1645
01:18:41,508 --> 01:18:42,508
It's about moments.

1646
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:45,637
Five years, ten years.
However long that moment was.

1647
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,306
The vibe. Something happened.

1648
01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:52,436
You have one guy
who's in the profession of tattoos,

1649
01:18:52,519 --> 01:18:54,771
which has gone from, like, this fringe,

1650
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:58,108
and now I don't know one fucking person
who doesn't have a tattoo.

1651
01:18:58,191 --> 01:18:59,901
And then on this side of the spectrum,

1652
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:02,672
you have photography, which was
like this, and now it's, like, nothing.

1653
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:04,990
Both things are symbiotic
and feeding off each other.

1654
01:19:05,073 --> 01:19:08,160
But one of those things
brings in a ton of cash,

1655
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:10,579
and the other one,
the cash is disappearing.

1656
01:19:10,662 --> 01:19:13,165
The tension that must bring
between brothers...

1657
01:19:13,248 --> 01:19:14,248
Eventually...

1658
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:15,750
it was gone.

1659
01:19:20,338 --> 01:19:22,132
The last time I'll ever be here.

1660
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:24,468
We were here for 13 years.

1661
01:19:24,551 --> 01:19:28,972
We used to call our little thing here
"Skid Row's finest"

1662
01:19:29,055 --> 01:19:32,058
because we were surrounded
by the people of Skid Row.

1663
01:19:32,142 --> 01:19:34,436
And that's it. It's a wrap.

1664
01:19:34,519 --> 01:19:35,771
S.A. Studios.

1665
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:37,355
We're out of downtown.

1666
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:39,148
Gone.

1667
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:43,236
That was probably one
of the most challenging times in my life.

1668
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:44,946
And...

1669
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:48,742
I made it, 'cause I'm a fighter.

1670
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:51,161
That was it.

1671
01:19:52,037 --> 01:19:53,037

the new S.A. Studios.

1709
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,845
Well, my part of it.
Cartoon has a different part.

1710
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:17,599
So... here we are.

1711
01:22:18,975 --> 01:22:20,477
S.A. Studios.

1712

You can barely fit in here.

1713
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:29,986
These are the new S.A. Studios.

1714
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,202
These are all bills
that haven't been paid.

1715
01:22:37,702 --> 01:22:39,079
You know, just so everybody knows

1716
01:22:39,162 --> 01:22:42,374
what it's like to be
a world-famous photographer.

1717
01:22:57,180 --> 01:22:59,140
Where am I today?
I'm in a good place.

1718
01:22:59,724 --> 01:23:00,892
I'm an optimist.

1719
01:23:01,142 --> 01:23:03,853
I'm always gonna look
at what's the solution,

1720
01:23:04,187 --> 01:23:06,189
what do I got to be grateful for,

1721
01:23:06,439 --> 01:23:07,941
how can I make this pop.

1722
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:12,779
I haven't stopped one day
since S.A. Studios.

1723
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:15,031
I have a private studio right here.

1724
01:23:15,115 --> 01:23:17,575
I own this property. Can't kick me out.

1725
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:19,869
And it's all dialed into my needs,

1726
01:23:19,953 --> 01:23:21,663
I airbrush the cars in here.

1727
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:24,666
I've been here for five years now and...

1728
01:23:25,041 --> 01:23:26,041
I love it.

1729
01:23:31,798 --> 01:23:34,009
Attention! Attention!

1730
01:23:35,301 --> 01:23:37,345
There's our lovely Sixth Street Bridge.

1731
01:23:38,054 --> 01:23:39,305
No more.

1732
01:23:39,597 --> 01:23:41,725
So crazy to see all this shit.

1733
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:44,102
Fucking changing so fast.

1734
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:47,731
This is a mural by my friend Risky.

1735
01:23:47,814 --> 01:23:49,232
Everybody knows Risk.

1736
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:51,776
This was a parking lot before.

1737
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:55,739
Some metal rinky-dink buildings,

1738
01:23:55,822 --> 01:23:57,115
and now it's like...

1739
01:23:57,991 --> 01:24:00,785
the biggest fucking most...

1740
01:24:01,619 --> 01:24:04,831
apartments, fuck it,
whatever you could get in there.

1741
01:24:05,498 --> 01:24:09,627
I don't feel like a victim.
I feel like I'm on top of everything.

1742
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:11,337
I'm on top of social media,

1743
01:24:11,421 --> 01:24:14,299
I know how to use Photoshop,
I know how to use a computer.

1744
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:15,925
I taught myself all that.

1745
01:24:16,342 --> 01:24:19,846
The guys that didn't do that,
they probably feel overwhelmed.

1746
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:27,228
And then I was trying to keep up
with the Joneses, and, you know,

1747
01:24:27,312 --> 01:24:28,312
trying to post...

1748
01:24:28,354 --> 01:24:29,522
I tried all that shit.

1749
01:24:29,606 --> 01:24:31,316
I tried to post hot girls,

1750
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:33,401
big celebrities, gangster stuff.

1751
01:24:33,485 --> 01:24:34,861
I tried to post everything

1752
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:37,530
at certain times a day
on certain days and I'm like,

1753
01:24:37,614 --> 01:24:39,824
"How the fuck does this guy
have a million followers

1754
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:43,078
and I got 115,000 or whatever?" You know?

1755
01:24:43,161 --> 01:24:46,122
Every time I'd think
I was doing some big shit, good shit,

1756
01:24:46,206 --> 01:24:48,666
and I go, "Oh,
I'm gonna show Instagram right now.

1757
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:50,001
Fuck everybody."

1758
01:24:50,376 --> 01:24:52,796
You know. "All my haters
are gonna come out on this one."

1759
01:24:52,879 --> 01:24:55,715
I would post something and it'd be like,
"wah, wah, wah."

1760
01:24:55,799 --> 01:24:56,966
And I was like, "Man."

1761
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:59,803
I got more likes just from taking
a picture of my dog

1762
01:24:59,886 --> 01:25:01,846
with my iPhone or something, you know.

1763
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:04,849
All the algorithms and the analytics
and all that, and I was like,

1764
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:08,186
"Man, this shit is,
like, so time-consuming

1765
01:25:08,269 --> 01:25:09,479
and overwhelming."

1766
01:25:09,562 --> 01:25:12,273
It's tiring to try
and keep up with the Joneses, so...

1767
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:15,485
Sometimes I just say,
"Fuck it, who am I doing all this shit...?"

1768
01:25:15,568 --> 01:25:17,779
And I go and, you know, do work

1769

to a place of respect and high art.

1801

01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:20,211
They're doing it better
than they ever have, and that's pride.

1841
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:22,422
That's heart. That's Chicano.

1842
01:28:23,172 --> 01:28:25,425
With all the racism, xenophobia

1843
01:28:25,508 --> 01:28:27,593
that's going on right now in the US,

1844
01:28:27,677 --> 01:28:30,722
for Chicano art to just be pushed
as hard as possible,

1845
01:28:30,805 --> 01:28:35,184
whether it's a direct a political message
or just as a style, is a great thing.

1846
01:28:35,268 --> 01:28:37,061
These ICE agents and these raids

1847
01:28:37,145 --> 01:28:38,271
and the racism,

1848
01:28:38,354 --> 01:28:40,732
it's only gonna speak to our cultures.

1849
01:28:40,815 --> 01:28:43,401
The culture has to be
a little louder than the hate.

1850
01:28:43,484 --> 01:28:45,924
<i>♪ Cause they say I rhyme
They say I look like a gremlin... ♪</i>

1851
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:48,865
We're gonna keep moving forward,
keep creating

1852
01:28:48,948 --> 01:28:51,617
and stay true to this culture.
