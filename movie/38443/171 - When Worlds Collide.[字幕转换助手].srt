1
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:08,780
Oopsy-daisy.

2
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:10,860
So, then Jeremy said–

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:11,860
Ugh!

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:12,570
Stacy?

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,820
Phineas and Ferb, that was important!

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,490
You guys are so gonna get it!!

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,450
Mom!

8
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,540
Elsewhere, in space.

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,750
I think the boys are shooting green lasers in the backyard.

10
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:27,340
Look!

11
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,170
Hey, Ferb.

12
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,050
I can totally see up your nose.

13
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,970
Hey, kids, how's the over-nighter going?

14
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:32,970
Great, Mom!

15
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,260
Everyone's helping, even Perry.

16
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,640
Candace, do you remember two weeks ago, when we wrote up this contract?

17
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,520
The Bust Accord?

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,310
And do you recall article twelve?

19
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,060
Yes.

20
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,770
"I will not attempt to bust my brothers more than once a day."

21
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:46,520
I remember.

22
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:46,770
But–

23
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,520
And what happened earlier today?

24
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,480
I tried to show you a giant ant farm.

25
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,110
Excellent, we have an understanding.

26
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,030
Now go to bed.

27
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,360
You can try again tomorrow.

28
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:55,200
Fine!

29
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,620
I'll just wait till tomorrow.

30
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:57,990
Wait a minute.

31
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,780
At midnight, it'll be tomorrow.

32
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,870
I can just stay up and bust them.

33
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,120
This sleepover is a good idea.

34
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,750
How are we all supposed to see through that puny telescope?

35
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,840
The telescope is just to find the probe we launched seventeen months ago.

36
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,460
Then we can tap into the signal from deep space.

37
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:20,220
And using Dad's old projection screen and some fiber optics to relay the images from the probe, we can view the galaxy in comfort from these lawn chairs.

38
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,350
Space probe?

39
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,810
Fiber optics?

40
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,770
Ooh, I can smell a bust comin' tonight.

41
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,730
These joysticks should control the space probe remotely.

42
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,690
Come on, already!

43
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,190
Let's start lookin' for stuff.

44
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,110
Buford, I've never seen you so enthusiastic.

45
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,490
I have my reasons.

46
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,320
Oh, here we go again.

47
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,740
He's going to tell the story of when he was abducted by aliens.

48
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,370
It wasn't an abduction, it was an encounter.

49
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,410
Encounter?

50
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,830
Yeah, I was walkin' out in the woods one night with my lucky tambourine.

51
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:52,050
(Song: Whalemingo)

52
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,310
? Float by ?

53
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,600
? Drift through my dreams! ?

54
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,350
? Whalemingo! ?

55
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,940
? (Whalemingo!) ?

56
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,030
? In the sky ?

57
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,860
? Like strawberry cream! ?

58
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,660
? Whalemingo! ?

59
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,370
? (Whalemingo!) ?

60
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,250
? You take a whale ?

61
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,580
? You drop the fla ?

62
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,040
? You keep the mingo, that's how I named it whalemingo! ?

63
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,010
? (Whalemingo!) ?

64
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,050
? If you see a big, pink whale ?

65
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:45,220
? With feathers and a beak and skinny little legs, then bingo ?

66
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,390
? That's a whalemingo! ?

67
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,650
? (Whalemingo!) ?

68
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,940
? (Whalemingo!) ?

69
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,990
? (Whalemingo!) ?

70
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,950
I think about you often, whalemingo.

71
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:01,160
? (Whalemingo!) ?

72
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,870
? (Whalemingo!) ?

73
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,200
? (Whalemingo!) ?

74
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,700
And that's my story!

75
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,870
I didn't know you had a lucky tambourine.

76
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,670
This whole story is ridiculous.

77
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:11,500
No, it's not!

78
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,540
I have proof.

79
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,250
Ugh, here comes the picture.

80
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:14,790
See?

81
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,750
I named him Tristan.

82
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,210
That is just a flamingo.

83
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:21,430
Tristan is not a flamingo, he's from outer space, and he's a whalemingo.

84
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,180
But then he had to go home, and I never saw him again.

85
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,350
Hey, what are you doin' with your hands?

86
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:27,890
Mocking you.

87
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,640
All right.

88
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,770
I'd be angry, but I admire your honesty.

89
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,650
There you are, Agent P.

90
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,150
Sorry to call you in for a second time today but...

91
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,360
Oh, this?

92
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:40,780
It's–

93
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,700
It's just an exfoliating mask.

94
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,330
I have another ten minutes before I can peel it off, or I get zero of the benefits.

95
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,080
Agent P, we just got word that Doof may have fired tomorrow's inator, today.

96
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,880
This is a major breach in protocol.

97
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,090
So, give yourself a good slap in the face, and get over there.

98
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,220
? Perry! ?

99
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,350
Okay, gang, let's fire this thing up.

100
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,940
Zoom in on the swirly thing.

101
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,280
My gut tells me, that's where the whalemingos are.

102
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,150
Roger that.

103
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,740
Hey, it's our milkshake bar!

104
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,910
And business seems to be booming.

105
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,370
What about over to the left?

106
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,120
Okay.

107
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,040
Wow.

108
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,870
Yeah, wow.

109
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,290
It's a whole planet of...

110
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,290
...whalemingos.

111
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,590
I do not believe it.

112
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,840
Buford was right.

113
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,090
They're all so beautiful.

114
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,510
Tristan.

115
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,730
? Volgen nu! ?

116
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,110
(Song: Double Dutch)

117
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,900
? One dutch, two dutch ?

118
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,860
? Queens of the double dutch ?

119
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,940
? We skip better than you by that much ?

120
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,700
? Watch our feet, our moves are sweet ?

121
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,820
? Our double dutchin' won't be beat... ?

122
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,450
Perry the Platypus?

123
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,370
How did you get stuck in my double dutch machine?

124
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,620
That's not even a trap.

125
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,620
Anyway, what are you doing here?

126
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,040
Oh, that.

127
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,840
T-The beam that I shot through my roof?

128
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,050
Well, that was just an accidental misfire from my Sphere-attract-inator.

129
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,680
Luckily it was pointed up, so it didn't hit anything.

130
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:32,850
Anyway, I started thinking and realized the true measure of a man is having a world famous roadside attraction.

131
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,730
But which one to choose?

132
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,850
Which one would be the most spectacular?

133
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,320
Then it hit me, nothing brings them in like a big ball of twine.

134
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,440
So that's why I built the Sphere-Attract-inator.

135
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,740
To steal the world's largest ball of twine!

136
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,320
Then all I need is some sort of road to put it beside.

137
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,080
Right?

138
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,790
I gotta admit Buford, I had my doubts, but whalemingos are truly amazing.

139
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,500
Told ya.

140
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,410
Hey!

141
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,790
Why's everything all fuzzy?

142
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,670
I'm not sure.

143
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,380
Let me back it up and we'll take a look.

144
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,800
It looks like the planet's growing.

145
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,880
Planets do that, right?

146
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,720
It is not growing, it is getting closer!

147
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,930
This sounds serious.

148
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:09,470
Ah!

149
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,800
This is catastrophic!

150
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,220
Should we not do something?

151
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,640
Should no one inform the populous of the impending impact?

152
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,100
Calm down, Baljeet.

153
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,980
I'm sure the government scientists are already doing something.

154
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,440
Duck and cover!

155
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,730
My watermelon!

156
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,070
Based on my calculations, the planet will be here by midnight!

157
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,150
That's great news!

158
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,150
Our planets are going to collide!

159
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,530
You do know what that means?

160
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,620
Sure, it's like when you have two sets of keys.

161
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,830
And you keep one in the car.

162
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,910
No, it means...

163
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,420
NO!

164
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:42,250
It means all life is going to be wiped out on both planets!

165
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,010
Guys, we've gotta save Tristan!

166
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,510
Anything else, Buford?

167
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,590
And the Earth.

168
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:52,850
Oh, Perry the Platypus, what do you say we open up the roof and activate the Sphere-Attract-inator?

169
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:57,560
Then I can get a good night's rest before all the crowds arrive to see the world's biggest ball of–

170
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,940
? Nu! ?

171
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,110
? One dutch, two dutch ?

172
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,150
? Queens of the double dutch ?

173
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,070
? We skip better than you by that much ?

174
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,820
? Watch our feet, our moves are sweet ?

175
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,870
? Our double dutchin' won't be beat ?

176
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,830
? Touwtje springen ?

177
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,950
? Fast feud ?

178
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,750
? Touwtje ?

179
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,630
What are we gonna do?

180
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:25,210
We could use electro magnets, if only we knew the planet's molecular density.

181
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,010
I got a pail of water and a nest to make Tristan comfortable.

182
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,630
I figure I can keep him in my garage 'till spring.

183
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,430
Spring.

184
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:32,430
Spring!

185
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,260
That's it.

186
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,390
Guys, I know what we're gonna do tonight!

187
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,350
? One dutch, two dutch ?

188
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,390
? Queens of the double dutch ?

189
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,180
Oh, you sassy.

190
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:37,850
? We ski– ?

191
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,320
I knew they'd practically bust themselves, by just waited long enough.

192
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:53,410
You guys are so busted, in like... nine minutes.

193
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,740
You guys are so busted, in like... nine minutes.

194
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,870
Oh, hey Candace, glad you're still up.

195
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,500
You'll get to see the cool planet coming directly at us.

196
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,790
But don't worry, we're building a giant spring to bounce it back into space where it came from.

197
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,580
A spring?

198
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,920
That's not very scientific.

199
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,380
But it is still bustable.

200
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,420
Here comes the planet now.

201
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,670
I can't wait 'till they get here.

202
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,380
Tristan!

203
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,220
Finally!

204
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,850
It's tomorrow!

205
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:15,640
Mom! Mom!

206
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,100
Mom! Mom!

207
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
What are you guys doing?

208
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,770
Oh, hi, honey.

209
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:22,770
We were just listening to some records. It's what we used to use for music when we were kids.

210
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,730
Candace, I thought we had an understanding.

211
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:25,940
Yeah, it's midnight.

212
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,480
Tomorrow.

213
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,320
Don't worry, it'll be all right.

214
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,640
The world's largest ball of twine is on its way!

215
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,640
Y-You'd better stand back, i-it's supposed to be huge! It's supposed–

216
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:02,640
What?

217
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,140
That's it?

218
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,690
Goodbye, Tristan!

219
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,820
Remember me!

220
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,330
I got a twine ball bigger than this in my junk drawer.

221
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,210
Help me, Perry the Platypus!

222
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,130
I'm slipping!

223
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,090
Oh, thank you, Perry the Pla–

224
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,430
? Nu! ?

225
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:39,050
I mean, curse you, Perry the Platypus!!!

226
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,600
? One dutch, two dutch ?

227
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
? Queens of the double dutch ?

228
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,060
? We skip better than you by– ?

229
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,730
Hurry, let's go! 
Let's go!

230
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,690
Clearly we need a thirteenth amendment to The Bust Accord.

231
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,610
Mom?!

232
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,820
You kids okay out here?

233
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,990
Yeah, we're great!

234
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,320
We saw a giant planet filled with whalemingos!

235
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,490
Whalemingos, huh?

236
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,660
Why don't you all come on in for midnight snack?

237
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:01,740
Wash your hands.

238
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,160
Especially you, Buford.

239
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,710
Hey, sleepyhead, do you want a snack too?
