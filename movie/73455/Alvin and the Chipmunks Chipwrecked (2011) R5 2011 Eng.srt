4
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,316
One, two, three...
Boys.

5
00:01:32,351 --> 00:01:35,489
Guys, stop.

6
00:01:35,589 --> 00:01:39,202
Where's Alvin?
- Hi, Dave.

7
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,292
Where were you?
- I try to ships.

8
00:01:44,327 --> 00:01:46,745
I already did.
I've also seen our room...

9
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,163
I made the bed closest to the window...

10
00:01:49,198 --> 00:01:51,787
I ordered a pina colada.

11
00:01:51,822 --> 00:01:55,985
And I have given to us parasailing.
- There you are too young.

12
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,677
I thought we went on vacation
to have fun.

13
00:01:58,712 --> 00:02:01,334
For family vacations, only to
fun.

14
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:03,477
But first we need some rules to capture.

15
00:02:03,512 --> 00:02:06,683
First, you should not go to bed
to everyone in the room.

16
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,558
This is a good, Simon.
This is our first line.

17
00:02:10,593 --> 00:02:13,505
Will we go through the rest.
- Come on, Dave.

18
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,747
Rules is my middle name.

19
00:02:48,223 --> 00:02:50,174
This is your captain.

20
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:55,141
Everything is permitted.
You do not get bored.

21
00:04:17,422 --> 00:04:19,308
We had about rules, Alvin.

22
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:22,978
Sorry, I did not know we according to the present agreement should not make fun.

23
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:26,579
You can have fun.
If you act not like a child?

24
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:32,219
When you treat me more like a child?
- If you feel like an adult behaves.

25
00:04:32,254 --> 00:04:36,190
I'm going to act like an adult,
like you...

26
00:04:42,756 --> 00:04:46,180
Not now, girls.
- I'm sorry, Dave.

27
00:04:46,215 --> 00:04:48,166
I must prepare for
dinner with the captain.

28
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:51,420
Do we eat with the captain?
- No, I. You stay here.

29
00:04:51,455 --> 00:04:54,639
I have to apologize for everything
what Alvin did.

30
00:04:54,703 --> 00:04:59,731
This is so unfair. Not for us, not for Dave
and certainly not for the captain.

31
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,931
This certainly looking forward to dinner with me
.

32
00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:06,617
I'll go talk to Dave.
See if I can iron the whole thing smooth.

33
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:15,553
What is it, Simon?
- I would never say to Alvin.

34
00:05:15,588 --> 00:05:18,339
It is really irresponsible.

35
00:05:18,374 --> 00:05:20,739
I really want something.

36
00:05:20,774 --> 00:05:23,528
You want me to propose something?
- I'm going crazy from him.

37
00:05:23,563 --> 00:05:25,674
For far longer than he makes you mad.

38
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:27,144
What is it?

39
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:30,782
Imagine Alvin
a fiery race horse.

40
00:05:30,817 --> 00:05:34,350
Is that your advice?
- I'm not done Dave.

41
00:05:34,385 --> 00:05:38,421
Alvin is a race horse.
- And you are helpful jockey.

42
00:05:38,456 --> 00:05:42,457
This is to place it on the racetrack
of life support.

43
00:05:42,681 --> 00:05:46,780
But if you hold the reins too tight, then that
race horse fighting and goats.

44
00:05:46,876 --> 00:05:50,816
That's not fun for anyone.
But if you hold the reins looser...

45
00:05:51,424 --> 00:05:53,891
So he flies off the track into the fence.

46
00:05:54,403 --> 00:05:56,258
I know you want to protect Alvin.

47
00:05:56,293 --> 00:06:00,488
Sometimes children rise above himself,
if you give them confidence.

48
00:06:10,257 --> 00:06:13,556
Room is on its way.
Lights out at nine hours.

49
00:06:13,591 --> 00:06:15,443
Question.

50
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:18,168
If we in this room are held captive
...

51
00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:19,542
By Alvin.

52
00:06:19,577 --> 00:06:21,755
Can we at least see a movie?

53
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,446
Let's see what there is.

54
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,581
You choose just one film.
You are old enough to decide.

55
00:06:32,616 --> 00:06:35,111
Really, Dave?
- Absolutely.

56
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:39,560
Dave looks so elegant.
- Have fun.

57
00:06:39,595 --> 00:06:43,182
Dave, before you go.
I made you something.

58
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:52,179
... That's really - it is soft. You can sleep with it.

59
00:06:52,214 --> 00:06:55,865
All colors are in process.
It fits everywhere.

60
00:06:56,346 --> 00:06:59,388
Great. I do it after eating at.
- You can now belt.

61
00:06:59,423 --> 00:07:01,951
That everyone sees it that
to the master table.

62
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:06,563
Nice, a real chip Madness.

63
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,567
Have fun, guys.

64
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:18,253
But not too much fun.
I am still very upset.

65
00:07:19,758 --> 00:07:25,555
See you, Dave.
And hello, ladies.

66
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,886
I want my cocktail shaken, not stirred.

67
00:07:29,815 --> 00:07:31,577
Where are you going?
- At the casino.

68
00:07:31,612 --> 00:07:34,520
I'm Simon Rappy.
- No.

69
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:37,021
Dave said...
- he said, and I quote...

70
00:07:37,053 --> 00:07:39,599
"We are old enough to decide for themselves."

71
00:07:39,634 --> 00:07:42,111
We are old enough to choose from a movie.

72
00:07:42,146 --> 00:07:45,028
Not so.
Look like what Theodore did.

73
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:53,356
What's wrong with this movie?
- That's for babies.

74
00:07:53,388 --> 00:07:57,552
Why Dave treats us like babies
likely.

75
00:07:57,587 --> 00:08:00,003
Come on, Theodore.

76
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:02,420
That's more like it.

77
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,865
Alvin, please.

78
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:14,526
I say, we're going out tonight
- in our pajamas?

79
00:08:14,815 --> 00:08:16,993
I know already

80
00:09:06,572 --> 00:09:08,846
I am the winner.

81
00:09:10,191 --> 00:09:14,259
These dresses are great.
- You're so perky.

82
00:09:14,294 --> 00:09:17,846
Thank you.
That's my job.

83
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:20,405
Sorry.
- What are you?

84
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,803
We are the Chip Juliettes.
- I'm Eleanor.

85
00:09:23,838 --> 00:09:27,131
My sister tried to apologize.

86
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,408
What? The stairs at my girlfriend's toes
...

87
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:32,387
Or her silly silly dances.

88
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:37,992
You did not.
- Did they do.

89
00:09:38,027 --> 00:09:41,660
Take the weird stuff out of my face.

90
00:09:41,695 --> 00:09:45,294
Unless you want to meet my claws.

91
00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:47,857
They are real.

92
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,789
Do you do that?

93
00:11:17,856 --> 00:11:20,610
Captain, I'm really sorry
what happened to Alvin.

94
00:11:20,706 --> 00:11:23,044
He is a child and wanted
but what fun.

95
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,528
There is nothing wrong with that. Our pelican
ensures that everyone has fun.

96
00:11:27,624 --> 00:11:31,532
He goes on a hang glider around the ship.
It's really amusing.

97
00:11:31,628 --> 00:11:34,187
The safety of passengers
is my priority.

98
00:11:34,222 --> 00:11:38,002
Alvin or anyone else, must not be compromised
.

99
00:11:38,034 --> 00:11:39,635
Believe me, I understand.

100
00:11:39,731 --> 00:11:43,062
Alvin  If our lines again violate
Then there will be consequences follow.

101
00:11:43,158 --> 00:11:46,041
We do not want anybody hurt.

102
00:11:49,884 --> 00:11:52,574
Hot.
- I'm sorry.

103
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,418
Unbelievable.
Such a nice pants.

104
00:12:01,106 --> 00:12:03,892
Do you have a problem with me?
- Yes.

105
00:12:03,988 --> 00:12:06,134
Why?
- Either you do not know.

106
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:09,593
I do not know.

107
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,161
Ian?
What are you doing here?

108
00:12:14,546 --> 00:12:18,197
I'm working, Dave.
- Is this your job?

109
00:12:18,261 --> 00:12:20,823
There are not many record companies interested
a man to believe...

110
00:12:20,858 --> 00:12:23,147
Who has messed with the Chipmunks, and the Chip
Ettes...

111
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:27,165
And Justin Bieber rejected.
Twice.

112
00:12:27,805 --> 00:12:30,047
I'm sorry that you lost your job, and...

113
00:12:30,143 --> 00:12:36,325
Your dignity. That you do not get back
by hot things to throw over me.

114
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:39,944
You're right, Dave. It's too late for me
to my old life back... more

115
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,275
But it's not too late
to ruin yours too.

116
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:46,542
Do you want to ruin my life?
- Let's start with this holiday.

117
00:12:46,638 --> 00:12:50,545
If I see squirrels a line break, I go straight to
Captain Correlli.

118
00:12:50,738 --> 00:12:52,883
You're in my house.

119
00:12:53,268 --> 00:12:56,278
Technically it's not a house but a
ship.

120
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,200
The point is...

121
00:12:58,296 --> 00:13:00,602
I love watching you.

122
00:13:06,367 --> 00:13:08,289
If a hawk.

123
00:13:23,663 --> 00:13:26,833
Please eat my brains on.

124
00:13:28,115 --> 00:13:30,581
What are you looking at "Jungle Monster 4 '?

125
00:13:30,645 --> 00:13:32,534
Alvin, how can you...

126
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:37,723
Girls?

127
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,129
No.

128
00:13:44,737 --> 00:13:47,011
I'll be back.

129
00:13:48,837 --> 00:13:51,431
It's dark.

130
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:55,114
You are nominated for the International Music Award
. That is fantastic.

131
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,356
Yeah, pretty cool.
I think.

132
00:13:57,709 --> 00:13:59,758
If you hold a lot geslijm.

133
00:13:59,854 --> 00:14:04,434
We fly immediately after the cruise go.
We hope 'album of the year' are.

134
00:14:04,531 --> 00:14:09,815
Then you're the youngest ever winner.
- So young I am not.

135
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:15,100
I'm in a casino. Way past bedtime.
Not that I have a bedtime.

136
00:14:15,196 --> 00:14:17,630
Nobody tells me what to do.

137
00:14:19,488 --> 00:14:21,409
I wonder who "Alvin" is.

138
00:14:22,498 --> 00:14:27,431
Anyway, it was a fun conversation.
But I must run.

139
00:14:31,018 --> 00:14:32,555
You have big problems, young man.

140
00:14:32,651 --> 00:14:34,477
You can follow me on...

141
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,235
I did not play.
Honest.

142
00:14:41,843 --> 00:14:45,334
Your winnings, sir.
Busted.

143
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:48,505
I'm not running away. Actually, only to Alvin
stop.

144
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:50,779
Right.
- There they are, captain.

145
00:14:56,244 --> 00:14:59,479
Captain.
- What will he do?

146
00:14:59,511 --> 00:15:01,977
Should we walk the plank?
- Is there a board?

147
00:15:02,073 --> 00:15:04,985
There is no shelf.
Disobey you again...

148
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:08,863
Then you put the ship, and
miss the International Music Award. Got it?

149
00:15:08,895 --> 00:15:12,515
Yes, Dave.
- Absolutely.

150
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:17,447
Unless we have been disobedient.
- Why would you be doing?

151
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:20,682
Imagine that you say I
here to stay.

152
00:15:20,778 --> 00:15:24,429
'Alvin, if you rid of that chair,
get punishment.

153
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:27,117
But, I see pirates.

154
00:15:27,152 --> 00:15:31,027
Climbing ropes
along the side of the ship.

155
00:15:31,091 --> 00:15:36,504
I would simply grab my Swiss army knife can
and cut the ropes.

156
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,155
But I must stay, right?

157
00:15:40,251 --> 00:15:43,006
Yes, Alvin, that you need.
And what do you do with a pocket knife?

158
00:15:43,102 --> 00:15:47,041
Any penknife you talking about?

159
00:15:47,137 --> 00:15:48,963
Give it here.
You can hurt yourself.

160
00:15:49,507 --> 00:15:51,426
So, I was able to save the whole ship...

161
00:15:51,461 --> 00:15:54,279
Of 'steling' and 'roving'
And I still receive punishment?

162
00:15:54,376 --> 00:15:57,931
Alvin, the word "steling 'does not exist.
And roving' either.

163
00:15:58,027 --> 00:16:00,141
But, he does have a point, Dave.

164
00:16:00,237 --> 00:16:03,440
There are times when you need us trust
things to arrange themselves.

165
00:16:03,536 --> 00:16:06,258
I trusted you tonight, and see what
that brought me.

166
00:16:10,165 --> 00:16:13,432
He's probably mad
a pretty girl.

167
00:16:16,859 --> 00:16:20,639
Captain Correlli
You may still participate in an activity.

168
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,169
Is paragliding, wave boarding,
or bungee jumping?

169
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:25,187
No, shuffleboard.

170
00:16:27,108 --> 00:16:32,233
According to my calculations is 10% and 90%
shuffle board.

171
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:34,379
That's funny.

172
00:16:34,603 --> 00:16:37,005
Thank you.
Do you really?

173
00:16:37,101 --> 00:16:41,713
Dave, I think I prefer the board wants.
- Sorry, Alvin. This should be done.

174
00:16:42,354 --> 00:16:45,909
And I can do something, I did not have long
.

175
00:16:46,902 --> 00:16:49,272
Absolutely nothing.

176
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:59,937
Britney approaching the PUK.
Fits her movement.

177
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:03,137
Look at me, quite irritated...

178
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:07,015
And wondering whether I will keep my mouth ever
.

179
00:17:07,112 --> 00:17:10,186
Realizes that perhaps this is the case, and
slide.

180
00:17:10,346 --> 00:17:14,286
Too short.

181
00:17:14,638 --> 00:17:17,005
A costly mistake, ladies and gentlemen.

182
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,307
That will be its
the rest of her career pursuing.

183
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:27,449
Make jokes all you want, but even you can not
interesting.

184
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:37,923
Really? Would you make this interesting?
Then I can make this interesting.

185
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:39,684
What are you doing, Alvin?

186
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,022
Dave keeps an eye on us.

187
00:17:42,118 --> 00:17:45,449
The poor man has had no rest since he
us has met.

188
00:17:45,545 --> 00:17:47,755
He is exhausted.

189
00:17:47,851 --> 00:17:51,278
About, three, two, one.

190
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,841
Lights out.

191
00:17:53,937 --> 00:17:58,581
Time to sleep. Time out lines
into fun rules.

192
00:18:00,054 --> 00:18:03,513
Do you understand? I took the rules of
penalty rules...

193
00:18:03,548 --> 00:18:07,549
And set it to pleasure rules.
It works.

194
00:18:13,282 --> 00:18:16,228
You want to trade?
This is a beautiful kite.

195
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,702
I can see everything.

196
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,232
Come on, Simon.

197
00:18:38,328 --> 00:18:42,524
Forget it. I try always to save only
and I get in trouble.

198
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,075
This is good.
- Simon, do something.

199
00:18:52,036 --> 00:18:55,623
Really?
- Now, Simon.

200
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:02,349
Alvin has problems, and Simon must rescue
it appears again.

201
00:19:08,466 --> 00:19:10,260
Thank you, brother.

202
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:24,993
Thank you.

203
00:19:26,562 --> 00:19:30,854
Sleep baby sleep in the nice chair

204
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:35,137
when you wake up, your hair falls

205
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:53,169
Dave, help us.
- Boys.

206
00:19:57,813 --> 00:20:01,657
No.

207
00:20:12,482 --> 00:20:16,742
No, if you want to hang gliding
put you on the list like everyone else.

208
00:20:16,838 --> 00:20:18,119
You do not understand.

209
00:20:18,215 --> 00:20:22,155
Oh yes. Dave Seville is so special,
that the rules do not apply to him.

210
00:20:22,251 --> 00:20:24,140
Release.
- No, you let go.

211
00:20:47,393 --> 00:20:49,187
No.

212
00:20:51,044 --> 00:20:53,094
Awesome.
Well done, Seville.

213
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,432
I?
- Yeah, you.

214
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:01,666
Save your breath, Dave.
They come back to me.

215
00:21:04,356 --> 00:21:08,424
Looking back,
this was a bad idea.

216
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,602
We're losing altitude.

217
00:21:12,043 --> 00:21:14,605
I do not think I have more volhou.

218
00:21:15,118 --> 00:21:17,872
I'm so hungry.
A bite it.

219
00:21:17,968 --> 00:21:20,306
No.
- Just nibble?

220
00:21:20,402 --> 00:21:23,605
Do not nibble.
- Maybe I can lick the icing?

221
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:26,164
The glaze keeps you alive, Theodore.

222
00:21:26,199 --> 00:21:29,434
Its high fat content makes
a waterproof barrier.

223
00:21:29,594 --> 00:21:31,417
I'm dying of hunger.

224
00:21:31,452 --> 00:21:35,039
There are a lot of other things you
to die before you die of starvation.

225
00:21:35,135 --> 00:21:38,082
Dehydration, heat exhaustion...
- An Island.

226
00:21:38,178 --> 00:21:40,420
No, an island would be useful.

227
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:43,334
So you would really have to say.

228
00:21:55,633 --> 00:21:59,124
We live.

229
00:21:59,188 --> 00:22:05,082
I'll kill you.
- Nobody kills anyone.

230
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,612
Does not matter that he deserves it.

231
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:10,783
Thanks, Si, the bad impression that I do
.

232
00:22:10,879 --> 00:22:13,473
We do not worry about it
.

233
00:22:13,569 --> 00:22:17,348
Dave now knows that we're gone.
The whole crew looks to us now.

234
00:22:17,444 --> 00:22:21,736
Let's go relax and eat donuts.

235
00:22:25,964 --> 00:22:28,078
Did you that?

236
00:22:40,313 --> 00:22:43,708
Can not you speed?
- We are here for two hours.

237
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,640
Thanks to my pilates move my legs
fast, but they are now slower.

238
00:22:48,736 --> 00:22:50,434
Put ??your feet up.
Let me wait.

239
00:22:50,722 --> 00:22:56,103
You can not. The costume is a whole.
No pick where you can pick up the feet.

240
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:58,024
Do this suit off.

241
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,458
I can not.
- Why not?

242
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:03,469
I have no bottom.

243
00:23:05,391 --> 00:23:08,465
Look.
- No, it's good. I believe you.

244
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,764
No, look, an island.

245
00:23:12,117 --> 00:23:14,999
Perhaps the Chipmunks washed up there.

246
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,611
Faster.
Come on.

247
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,960
Please.

248
00:23:25,056 --> 00:23:27,874
It is not long until our rescue plane
SOS see...

249
00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:30,565
And our flight back to civilization.

250
00:23:30,597 --> 00:23:35,497
I can not hear airplanes or helicopters.

251
00:23:35,593 --> 00:23:40,750
Maybe Dave in a hot air balloon.
They are very quiet.

252
00:23:40,846 --> 00:23:43,472
Dave is established in a hot air balloon.

253
00:23:43,568 --> 00:23:46,355
But he does anyway?

254
00:23:46,451 --> 00:23:50,038
Course.
Only maybe not today.

255
00:23:50,134 --> 00:23:52,760
Alvin is right. We must prepare for the night
.

256
00:23:52,856 --> 00:23:56,155
What? You expect me to sleep outside?

257
00:23:56,251 --> 00:24:00,960
I think squirrels live in the wild.

258
00:24:01,056 --> 00:24:04,162
We lived in the wild.

259
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:08,230
It's just one night.
- A cold night.

260
00:24:08,774 --> 00:24:12,874
Then we make a fire. We always
stabbing everything in the fire accidentally.

261
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:15,340
How hard can it be if you
think about it.

262
00:24:15,436 --> 00:24:17,262
How do you do that?

263
00:24:17,358 --> 00:24:21,233
I will make a spark, with my Swiss army knife on the stone
to...

264
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:24,276
Dave who has taken away from me.

265
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:28,055
You certainly have a better idea, smart boy?

266
00:24:28,152 --> 00:24:30,650
Sure, smart boy.

267
00:24:30,746 --> 00:24:36,991
As you can see the glasses captures the energy from the sun
, so get your fire.

268
00:24:38,913 --> 00:24:41,796
Impressive.
- Thank you.

269
00:24:41,892 --> 00:24:44,294
Thank you for that thought.

270
00:24:57,714 --> 00:25:00,116
We have made a fire.

271
00:25:00,468 --> 00:25:03,575
What do we do?

272
00:25:31,183 --> 00:25:33,841
We need to go there.

273
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:38,517
From the top of the mountain, we can better oversee
the island.

274
00:25:38,614 --> 00:25:41,432
Then we can see if they are here.
- Understood.

275
00:25:43,514 --> 00:25:46,589
What are you doing?
- I make a fire.

276
00:25:46,685 --> 00:25:51,969
The studio had no Snoop
more matches and we have made fire with two sticks.

277
00:25:52,004 --> 00:25:56,165
How hard can it be.
- Forget the fire, we must climb.

278
00:25:58,631 --> 00:26:03,307
It's dark and cold.
I make a fire. We're going tomorrow.

279
00:26:03,403 --> 00:26:07,535
No, we are now.
- Do not talk to me in such a tone.

280
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,681
I'm not one of your chipmunks who can command
...

281
00:26:09,716 --> 00:26:11,507
In a cage and stop whenever you want.

282
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:14,133
Did you, Ian.
- Calm.

283
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:19,802
Logical that it would prefer a ship
balls fly off then one day be with you.

284
00:26:19,898 --> 00:26:24,030
They did not express.
It was an accident. They're just kids.

285
00:26:26,464 --> 00:26:28,962
How long can they survive?

286
00:26:37,706 --> 00:26:41,037
And you were worried.
Look at us now.

287
00:26:41,293 --> 00:26:44,015
We are warm, a nice fire
fire.

288
00:26:44,111 --> 00:26:49,204
A beautiful night sky and if
a rescue helicopter comes along, they see us.

289
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,271
Everything is good.
- Good night, boys.

290
00:26:53,752 --> 00:26:55,577
Good night.
- Good night.

291
00:26:56,474 --> 00:26:58,940
Good night.
- Can I...

292
00:27:01,695 --> 00:27:05,154
What? I always
the lights when we said goodnight.

293
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:08,293
That fire was the only thing that protected against freezing
death.

294
00:27:09,317 --> 00:27:11,655
Can not light again?
- How?

295
00:27:11,752 --> 00:27:14,474
With your glasses and the sun...

296
00:27:39,776 --> 00:27:44,004
Great as the courage to hold back.

297
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,822
What can this be?

298
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:49,449
Breakfast.
- No, it's bark.

299
00:27:49,545 --> 00:27:52,876
Yes, for breakfast.
- I think it's very nice.

300
00:27:59,794 --> 00:28:01,267
It is not.

301
00:28:01,363 --> 00:28:04,470
It is centuries since our last
"You can eat whatever you want 'buffet.

302
00:28:04,566 --> 00:28:08,858
Idiot proposal. Let's go off this beach
, and to find real food.

303
00:28:09,903 --> 00:28:15,028
If I still know my horticulture,
and that is true, that these are mango trees.

304
00:28:15,424 --> 00:28:17,698
Where are all the mangoes, then?

305
00:28:17,794 --> 00:28:21,253
Perhaps the jungle monster
eaten them.

306
00:28:33,776 --> 00:28:38,644
I thought you were planning to share?
- Of course.

307
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:42,968
It seemed as if what you wanted to eat
alone.

308
00:28:43,064 --> 00:28:46,523
What?
I would never do.

309
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:48,445
I do not believe you.

310
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,505
I got it.

311
00:29:12,081 --> 00:29:14,644
My nuts.

312
00:29:15,765 --> 00:29:18,839
Well done, Theodore.
- Take him.

313
00:29:18,936 --> 00:29:21,786
Do not listen to him, Theo.
He eats everything alone.

314
00:29:21,882 --> 00:29:24,701
I share it with you.
- No, they take you for a ride.

315
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:26,619
No, you're trying to trick him.

316
00:29:26,654 --> 00:29:30,049
No, you. In saying that I
he wants to take the mickey.

317
00:29:30,466 --> 00:29:34,565
He lies, Theo.
- What?

318
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:47,216
Theodore, very sorry.

319
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:10,277
My favorite.

320
00:30:15,754 --> 00:30:17,547
Stop.

321
00:30:17,643 --> 00:30:22,415
Look at us again. A day on this island and we're animals become
.

322
00:30:23,729 --> 00:30:26,355
Do you hear that?

323
00:30:28,629 --> 00:30:31,768
What was that?
- A jungle monster.

324
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,010
On your site, all of them.

325
00:30:35,515 --> 00:30:39,070
Hold.

326
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:42,817
Fire.
- No. Why?

327
00:30:42,849 --> 00:30:44,899
Please do not eat us up, Mr. Jungle Monster.

328
00:30:44,995 --> 00:30:48,775
I'm not a monster. I'm Zoe.
And I'm obviously a girl.

329
00:30:49,928 --> 00:30:53,483
Those have long on this island is that...

330
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:57,518
She imagines that squirrels can talk.

331
00:30:57,614 --> 00:31:00,977
We Chipmunks.
- Yes, Alvin and the Chipmunks.

332
00:31:01,073 --> 00:31:02,899
What?

333
00:31:02,995 --> 00:31:05,878
You have probably heard about Chip Juliettes.
We are world famous.

334
00:31:05,974 --> 00:31:08,504
Who?
- Maybe it helps.

335
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:25,095
Stop.

336
00:31:25,191 --> 00:31:28,906
I do not know who you are.
- Strange.

337
00:31:29,002 --> 00:31:31,404
How long have you here exactly?

338
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,454
I'm here on a Monday came.

339
00:31:33,489 --> 00:31:38,771
So eight or nine years.

340
00:31:38,995 --> 00:31:43,030
Have you been here nine years?
- It can also eight.

341
00:31:43,158 --> 00:31:47,386
If we are now nine years to stay?
Here to stay forever?

342
00:31:47,482 --> 00:31:49,308
I told you that Dave would come there.

343
00:31:49,404 --> 00:31:51,838
I always thought that Dave would
happening.

344
00:31:51,934 --> 00:31:53,984
And he never came.

345
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:58,084
What?
- Dave Henderson, my boss at UPS.

346
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:03,560
I flew cargo planes for them, until one day
I got dumped in the ocean.

347
00:32:03,657 --> 00:32:05,706
We have also crashed.

348
00:32:05,802 --> 00:32:09,326
However, our Dave will not rest until he found us
.

349
00:32:09,422 --> 00:32:12,432
Still, Alvin?
- Absolutely.

350
00:32:12,881 --> 00:32:15,603
I finally come out?

351
00:32:15,699 --> 00:32:19,030
I must tell the others.
- Are there others?

352
00:32:19,542 --> 00:32:23,098
Imagine being stuck here
and nobody to talk.

353
00:32:23,194 --> 00:32:25,019
I thought I would go mad.

354
00:32:26,941 --> 00:32:29,183
I want to introduce you to my friends...

355
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,090
This is Ms. Rowling, Fozzing, Caluwe Dinmar
and there Nerd.

356
00:32:33,187 --> 00:32:35,300
You look good, friend.

357
00:32:35,396 --> 00:32:37,767
They have also survived the crash.

358
00:32:40,553 --> 00:32:42,186
I am Theodore.

359
00:32:42,283 --> 00:32:45,261
Dave comes to pick us up.

360
00:32:46,734 --> 00:32:50,898
No, not Dave Henderson.
I saw your face it. Another Dave.

361
00:32:51,122 --> 00:32:54,389
You'll be thrilled.
We finally get to this island.

362
00:32:54,485 --> 00:32:57,912
It's funny.
- In a strange way.

363
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,307
This is cause for celebration.
Who is hungry?

364
00:33:01,371 --> 00:33:04,478
We are starving.
- Let's go to my house.

365
00:33:04,574 --> 00:33:07,617
Is it far?
I can not move.

366
00:33:07,713 --> 00:33:09,923
Who was talking about running?

367
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:43,264
That was cool.
- I know.

368
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,282
Come on, guys.

369
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:50,599
Is not that amazing?

370
00:33:50,727 --> 00:33:53,898
No, it was not great.
It's a miracle that we arrived safely.

371
00:33:54,058 --> 00:33:57,901
The chances of an injured squirrel
a sliding board is a six.

372
00:34:01,744 --> 00:34:04,050
Why do I always right?

373
00:34:06,068 --> 00:34:09,175
Is it?
- I sprained my ankle.

374
00:34:09,976 --> 00:34:12,890
You have to do some ice.

375
00:34:14,812 --> 00:34:18,015
I do not have ice.
I live there in that tree.

376
00:34:18,111 --> 00:34:20,545
I thought perhaps you had.

377
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:23,588
No, we have no ice and no hiding
.

378
00:34:23,684 --> 00:34:26,182
This is very annoying for you.

379
00:34:26,278 --> 00:34:27,751
Do you like bungee jumping?

380
00:34:27,847 --> 00:34:30,602
Yes.
- No, we do not like.

381
00:34:30,698 --> 00:34:33,645
Maybe you should leave us alone, then
we concentrate more on survival...

382
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,534
And less on ourselves to murder.

383
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:39,249
That's a lot of nerves
in a small package.

384
00:34:39,346 --> 00:34:43,029
I'm not nervous. I just do not want anyone else hurt
that...

385
00:34:44,951 --> 00:34:46,360
What was that?

386
00:34:46,456 --> 00:34:49,883
That was just a spider. Who live here, because this
nature.

387
00:34:49,979 --> 00:34:52,317
This is not just a spider.
This is the "Benotrella Valensise.

388
00:34:52,413 --> 00:34:54,495
Its bite contains neurotoxin.

389
00:34:54,591 --> 00:34:56,737
Mr. rhetoric.

390
00:34:56,833 --> 00:35:01,317
So what?
- Alvin, poison, neuroscience, brains?

391
00:35:01,413 --> 00:35:03,591
This is not good.

392
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:09,612
Side effects are "changes in personality
liability, loss of vision, dry throat.

393
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:15,185
Take it easy. I do get bitten twice
and I'm very normal.

394
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:18,484
Yes, usually.
- No, anyway.

395
00:35:20,149 --> 00:35:22,423
Simon.
- Fatty.

396
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,146
Come, fatty.

397
00:35:28,477 --> 00:35:31,135
I hope all is well with them.
- What does it matter whether they are in order...

398
00:35:31,231 --> 00:35:32,673
I want them here.

399
00:35:32,769 --> 00:35:36,324
And here I thought you had changed
and not just self.

400
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,563
No, and that's good.

401
00:35:38,598 --> 00:35:43,082
For the rage that I feel for you and the Chipmunks
keeps me going.

402
00:35:43,626 --> 00:35:47,181
Shall we continue?
- Please note that if we find something to eat or drink.

403
00:35:49,135 --> 00:35:51,345
Here.
- Where?

404
00:35:51,377 --> 00:35:54,003
The thing around your neck.
- Not that I eat.

405
00:35:54,099 --> 00:35:56,566
This was a gift from Theodore.
- That explains it.

406
00:35:56,662 --> 00:36:00,985
I wanted to say, 'that's awful ugly.

407
00:36:01,082 --> 00:36:04,060
It's not ugly.

408
00:36:04,156 --> 00:36:07,231
The fit in anywhere and it is soft enough to sleep
.

409
00:36:07,327 --> 00:36:10,210
And it is edible.
- You will eat my son not his chain.

410
00:36:10,306 --> 00:36:12,387
He's your son, Dave.

411
00:36:12,484 --> 00:36:14,629
He's just a Chipmunk.

412
00:36:22,412 --> 00:36:25,647
Dave, where are you?

413
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:42,878
Where are you, Alvin?

414
00:36:44,832 --> 00:36:47,939
I go to sleep.

415
00:37:34,604 --> 00:37:37,294
Simon, where are you going?

416
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:40,241
Who is Simon
you talking about?

417
00:37:40,689 --> 00:37:48,280
You.
- My name is not Simon, but Simone.

418
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,034
That's almost Simon.

419
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,956
And very different.

420
00:37:53,052 --> 00:37:56,351
Do you want to go on an adventure?
- What kind of adventure?

421
00:37:56,479 --> 00:38:00,451
The adventure called "The Law".
- Good.

422
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,134
Dave to show up.

423
00:38:06,504 --> 00:38:08,714
Simon and Theodore are gone.

424
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:11,821
They are probably hiding
to the search.

425
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:14,927
They can only talk about have.

426
00:38:15,023 --> 00:38:17,201
It's nothing for them to be so
getaway.

427
00:38:17,297 --> 00:38:20,212
Can you please look for them?
- Why can not you do?

428
00:38:21,045 --> 00:38:24,440
I have a problem I must solve
.

429
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:27,194
How is Eleanor?

430
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:29,436
With her doing well.
I'm talking about me.

431
00:38:29,532 --> 00:38:32,895
I have taken two days no longer prayed,
and I'm not.

432
00:38:32,991 --> 00:38:35,073
I can not be saved if I
so look.

433
00:38:49,614 --> 00:38:51,536
Hello, my friend.

434
00:38:51,632 --> 00:38:54,258
Simon, are you the bungee jumping?

435
00:38:54,354 --> 00:38:56,468
His name is not Simon.
- Simone.

436
00:38:56,564 --> 00:38:58,742
It seems a lot like Simon.

437
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:02,553
Yeah I thought so too.
But, he behaves very differently.

438
00:39:03,642 --> 00:39:06,044
A spider bite.
That's it.

439
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:09,567
Do you have side effects?
Personality change, loss of vision...

440
00:39:09,664 --> 00:39:11,489
Who are you?

441
00:39:11,585 --> 00:39:14,788
Simone is very cool.
- It's Simon, Theodore.

442
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,895
No, he's not cool.
- Goodbye, Alfred.

443
00:39:18,888 --> 00:39:23,211
My name is Alvin.
- Great, Simone.

444
00:39:23,276 --> 00:39:25,614
Theo, you're allowed.

445
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:29,233
Really? I've never done anything like this.
- And you never will.

446
00:39:29,521 --> 00:39:31,763
How can you let them do that?
What were you thinking?

447
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:34,453
I think, when my father
ashore on this island?

448
00:39:34,549 --> 00:39:37,944
We have great fun. Why do you
show and so nervous?

449
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:42,428
I? Nervous?
I'm not nervous, but funny.

450
00:39:42,524 --> 00:39:44,350
The one who is cool.
Just ask anyone.

451
00:39:44,446 --> 00:39:46,272
Who do I ask?

452
00:39:46,368 --> 00:39:49,186
You can not bungee jumping, Theodore.

453
00:39:49,282 --> 00:39:51,044
You're afraid if you go to a movie.

454
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,638
Go, Alvin.

455
00:40:02,286 --> 00:40:04,336
Can anyone help me?

456
00:40:06,065 --> 00:40:08,115
This is much better.

457
00:40:08,211 --> 00:40:11,926
These dresses are really great.

458
00:40:12,022 --> 00:40:15,674
Thank you.
This I made for you, Eleanor.

459
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:19,613
Look how happy you're suddenly.

460
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:23,745
In case you get tired, I
a wheelchair for you.

461
00:40:25,282 --> 00:40:27,204
Beautiful.

462
00:40:31,047 --> 00:40:32,937
Meet you, ladies.

463
00:40:33,193 --> 00:40:38,958
A kiss.
And again, a kiss.

464
00:40:42,449 --> 00:40:44,819
What is his name now?
- A spider has bitten him.

465
00:40:44,915 --> 00:40:47,958
He thinks he's some funny
French guy.

466
00:40:48,054 --> 00:40:52,442
He thinks he's the most interesting man in the world
.

467
00:40:58,335 --> 00:41:01,730
Yes.
- We must work to that shelter.

468
00:41:01,954 --> 00:41:06,534
Why? I can not imagine a better roof
than the stars in the sky.

469
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:10,858
How about a roof that is truly one roof?
It's raining.

470
00:41:10,954 --> 00:41:17,520
What is a little rain? We share the same aqueous feeds the flowers.

471
00:41:17,616 --> 00:41:22,292
This is idiotic.
The shelter was your idea. From you.

472
00:41:22,997 --> 00:41:24,823
Great.

473
00:41:24,919 --> 00:41:28,602
Do not forget the shelter but I want everybody
going up.

474
00:41:28,698 --> 00:41:31,645
I'll try, but I feel so useless
.

475
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,495
What do you do?

476
00:41:34,591 --> 00:41:38,947
What I wanted to do when
I first saw you.

477
00:41:52,527 --> 00:41:55,922
They do have a pneumonia.

478
00:41:55,957 --> 00:41:58,068
So dance in the rain...

479
00:42:10,943 --> 00:42:13,601
Zwier even if no mud around.
- Hello?

480
00:42:13,636 --> 00:42:15,875
Someone can lose an eye.

481
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,758
Looks cool off.

482
00:42:38,872 --> 00:42:42,107
Would you like to dance?
- Please.

483
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,900
Really
- Yes, Theodore.

484
00:42:45,694 --> 00:42:48,320
I can not believe they all
attention.

485
00:42:48,355 --> 00:42:51,392
I am handsome.
She is smart.

486
00:42:51,427 --> 00:42:56,295
Do you see me hanging out clever?
- Yes, I am the funny.

487
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:59,851
And handsome.
- That's really slippery mud.

488
00:42:59,886 --> 00:43:03,373
This is ridiculous.
They even listening?

489
00:43:03,408 --> 00:43:05,615
Silence.

490
00:43:06,672 --> 00:43:08,914
You start to sound like Dave.

491
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:13,846
No!

492
00:44:03,298 --> 00:44:04,835
What do you do?

493
00:44:05,348 --> 00:44:07,302
A shelter building.

494
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:11,337
Since I no longer
funny, I can just as well...

495
00:44:13,739 --> 00:44:15,885
Are responsible.

496
00:44:16,686 --> 00:44:18,188
Seriously?

497
00:44:18,223 --> 00:44:22,611
Since I am no longer the handsome,
I can 't build shelter.

498
00:44:22,646 --> 00:44:25,494
Good luck with that.
- Do you think I can not?

499
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:27,476
I did not say.

500
00:44:27,511 --> 00:44:30,074
I think so, but said nothing.

501
00:44:32,604 --> 00:44:34,878
So you want to play it so, huh?

502
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:39,394
Look.

503
00:44:40,579 --> 00:44:43,077
It's so French-like.

504
00:44:48,073 --> 00:44:49,611
Be careful.

505
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:55,408
Let's do it.

506
00:45:12,863 --> 00:45:17,379
Was not that nice trip?
- Luckily I do not wear pants.

507
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:20,259
Come on, guys.

508
00:45:20,294 --> 00:45:24,361
Is it really safe?
- Yes. I do this daily.

509
00:45:33,553 --> 00:45:35,091
Hang.

510
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:37,525
Theodore is here.

511
00:45:40,792 --> 00:45:42,874
No, look into my eyes.

512
00:45:45,372 --> 00:45:50,945
You have nothing to fear.
Yes, very good.

513
00:45:52,578 --> 00:45:54,276
You are safe. Bravo.
- You made it.

514
00:45:54,311 --> 00:45:56,229
You are so brave.

515
00:46:02,219 --> 00:46:03,948
Beautiful.

516
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:15,478
A double rainbow.
What does that mean?

517
00:46:16,824 --> 00:46:20,555
In life they are superstars,
but they are dead legends.

518
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:24,286
Tribute albums, funerals on pay per vieuw
... - Wait.

519
00:46:24,735 --> 00:46:27,041
Do you really think I do this for the money do?

520
00:46:27,649 --> 00:46:31,909
If you do it to women
to pick up, you're not doing.

521
00:46:32,325 --> 00:46:34,468
I do it because I love them.

522
00:46:34,503 --> 00:46:39,339
Go ahead if you
life behind to walk spoiled brats.

523
00:46:39,435 --> 00:46:41,613
If they are not.
- Not even Alvin?

524
00:46:41,648 --> 00:46:44,301
You do not even know them.

525
00:46:44,336 --> 00:46:48,464
Alvin may well be a nuisance...

526
00:46:48,499 --> 00:46:51,798
But he means well.
Sometimes he's what...

527
00:46:51,833 --> 00:46:53,912
Irresponsible. Nothing more.

528
00:47:04,514 --> 00:47:09,894
Simon is the kid with the most responsibility
I know.

529
00:47:09,929 --> 00:47:12,489
Sometimes he's too nervous.

530
00:47:26,229 --> 00:47:28,727
And then little Theodore
... - Dave.

531
00:47:29,207 --> 00:47:32,666
The first two were
I can barely cared.

532
00:47:32,701 --> 00:47:36,061
The third me will not care.

533
00:47:36,446 --> 00:47:38,784
Never mind. We are going through.

534
00:47:59,218 --> 00:48:01,460
To the surface.

535
00:48:22,214 --> 00:48:26,698
This is terrible.
- Had he not better than his?

536
00:48:26,733 --> 00:48:29,642
Where are you?

537
00:48:29,677 --> 00:48:32,495
Zoe, you have to do something.

538
00:48:32,975 --> 00:48:37,619
Caluwé, go find Simon.
I know you can.

539
00:48:43,865 --> 00:48:45,720
You do not believe it, huh?

540
00:48:45,755 --> 00:48:48,477
If Caluwé not find him, no one can
.

541
00:48:52,833 --> 00:48:53,919
See?

542
00:48:53,954 --> 00:48:56,801
Sorry I worried.

543
00:48:56,836 --> 00:49:01,897
I've got something for you.
Perhaps this is good.

544
00:49:02,505 --> 00:49:04,552
It's beautiful.

545
00:49:04,587 --> 00:49:06,346
Where did you find it?

546
00:49:06,381 --> 00:49:09,552
Yes, it's beautiful.
Where did you?

547
00:49:10,064 --> 00:49:12,146
In a cave behind the waterfall.

548
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:13,969
I thought you would be nice.

549
00:49:14,004 --> 00:49:18,808
But now I realize that even a gem
your beauty can not match.

550
00:49:22,715 --> 00:49:28,189
But there were
jewelry or diamonds?

551
00:49:28,224 --> 00:49:32,708
When I struck gold, I was
too long away from my Jeanette.

552
00:49:34,309 --> 00:49:35,655
What?

553
00:49:38,569 --> 00:49:41,225
Boys, they found it.

554
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:43,370
And they do not even
what they found.

555
00:49:43,405 --> 00:49:47,409
They think only one bracelet.
The rest of the treasure is for me.

556
00:49:47,444 --> 00:49:49,010
At all for me.

557
00:50:03,071 --> 00:50:04,896
What do you mean?

558
00:50:06,818 --> 00:50:13,544
You're one of those "Honey Badgers"
who take what they want. Drop it.

559
00:50:13,579 --> 00:50:16,683
If you are with me Dolte,
I'll go mad.

560
00:50:31,992 --> 00:50:34,747
You can be in a stabbing or a cobra strike
...

561
00:50:34,779 --> 00:50:37,245
But the squirrel can not care.

562
00:50:38,174 --> 00:50:43,811
I'm ready.
I can help you...

563
00:50:47,622 --> 00:50:50,569
This treehouse is great.

564
00:50:50,889 --> 00:50:53,352
Maybe you're still smart.

565
00:50:53,387 --> 00:50:55,981
Thank you, Alvin.
And yours is...

566
00:50:57,423 --> 00:50:59,245
You did your best.

567
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:04,469
We can quite comfortably
and chic, right?

568
00:51:05,398 --> 00:51:11,131
I think I know why Dave
not there yet.

569
00:51:11,166 --> 00:51:13,020
Why?

570
00:51:13,084 --> 00:51:15,454
Because he is not even looking.

571
00:51:16,255 --> 00:51:19,618
Why should he find us?

572
00:51:19,682 --> 00:51:22,693
Because he tired of me.

573
00:51:22,725 --> 00:51:26,216
Just as Simon makes me crazy...

574
00:51:26,248 --> 00:51:30,508
Make me crazy Dave for years.

575
00:51:31,437 --> 00:51:33,839
No wonder he hates me.

576
00:51:36,721 --> 00:51:41,141
Do not worry.
Dave really is.

577
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:44,952
It is certainly of Simon and Theodore.

578
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:52,575
Will Dave ever find us?

579
00:51:54,881 --> 00:51:59,525
I mean Simone.
- Sorry, did you speak to me?

580
00:51:59,621 --> 00:52:02,152
Yes, Dave.

581
00:52:02,184 --> 00:52:04,906
Will we ever find him?

582
00:52:05,194 --> 00:52:10,671
I see you're sad.
And I hate that.

583
00:52:10,703 --> 00:52:13,874
I will help you find friend Dave.

584
00:52:14,162 --> 00:52:17,429
Do you really think you can find him?
- I know I can t.

585
00:52:18,262 --> 00:52:21,689
And I find that one Simon
what you're talking about.

586
00:53:23,375 --> 00:53:28,179
Dave and I have never
met each other. Describe him.

587
00:53:28,435 --> 00:53:32,951
He is very friendly and a good storyteller.

588
00:53:33,016 --> 00:53:35,065
That really helped.

589
00:53:35,097 --> 00:53:37,884
And it is about the size.

590
00:53:38,813 --> 00:53:43,072
Is he by chance a large bird
that can not fly?

591
00:53:43,104 --> 00:53:44,898
I do not think so.

592
00:53:44,994 --> 00:53:48,421
Then those footprints
not his.

593
00:53:48,581 --> 00:53:50,407
Sample of the jungle.

594
00:53:54,667 --> 00:53:56,300
Did you hear that?

595
00:53:56,812 --> 00:54:01,200
Yes, my stomach rumbling.
- No, maybe it's a helicopter.

596
00:54:06,805 --> 00:54:11,161
Come face it, Dave, no one comes
save us.

597
00:54:11,257 --> 00:54:16,766
My stomach always sounds louder
until they one day just stop.

598
00:54:16,862 --> 00:54:20,321
Because I've eaten it.

599
00:54:21,186 --> 00:54:26,182
Perhaps there really anyone
and the Chipmunks are not even here.

600
00:54:29,353 --> 00:54:31,595
I'm talking really spoiled.

601
00:54:34,285 --> 00:54:38,129
I really hate to say this, but...

602
00:54:43,093 --> 00:54:46,616
You can really get along with them.

603
00:54:47,001 --> 00:54:48,570
They love you.

604
00:54:48,602 --> 00:54:53,438
I can know, because I
mistreats them. I hate them.

605
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:58,275
Whatever happens,
you've done nothing wrong.

606
00:55:00,741 --> 00:55:02,214
Thanks, Ian.

607
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,459
Ian.

608
00:55:19,189 --> 00:55:20,726
Get off me.

609
00:55:24,858 --> 00:55:27,965
The monster of the jungle
is real and it is angry.

610
00:55:28,061 --> 00:55:29,886
Or hungry.

611
00:55:32,256 --> 00:55:34,851
It means letting go.

612
00:55:50,737 --> 00:55:52,466
Great. A volcano.

613
00:55:52,498 --> 00:55:55,285
Of course, why the water was so warm.

614
00:55:55,381 --> 00:55:58,103
This is the underground magma chamber heated
.

615
00:55:58,135 --> 00:56:00,890
How do you know?
- No idea.

616
00:56:00,986 --> 00:56:05,710
The beauty sometimes I look at the science channel
.

617
00:56:05,745 --> 00:56:10,434
Hi, does anyone fancy a trip to the waterfall
or something?

618
00:56:10,466 --> 00:56:14,149
Not now. The whole island will explode.
- What?

619
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:18,761
We have this island.
We're building a fleet at once.

620
00:56:18,858 --> 00:56:23,566
Now or immediately after
a trip to the waterfall?

621
00:56:34,551 --> 00:56:36,537
I'm touched.

622
00:56:36,857 --> 00:56:38,651
Dave his necklace?

623
00:56:38,971 --> 00:56:43,423
Tell Janet that I always will watch over her
with the angels.

624
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,142
Dave?

625
00:56:54,601 --> 00:56:56,363
Theodore.

626
00:57:02,096 --> 00:57:05,619
Dave? I told him that we would find
.

627
00:57:05,715 --> 00:57:07,476
Simon.
- It's Simon.

628
00:57:07,508 --> 00:57:10,615
I'm sometimes confused by
that Simon guy.

629
00:57:10,647 --> 00:57:12,377
Maybe we are like each other.

630
00:57:16,444 --> 00:57:18,430
You thought it was chubby.

631
00:57:18,494 --> 00:57:22,209
Do not worry, Theodore,
there is nothing happen. Yet?

632
00:57:26,341 --> 00:57:28,006
What was that?

633
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:31,273
This is an active volcano.

634
00:57:33,259 --> 00:57:38,223
Britney and I build the deck.
Eleanor, you tied the ropes.

635
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:41,554
Janet, collect as many coconuts and mangoes
if you can.

636
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:45,494
Who knows how long we are at sea.
- What can I do to help?

637
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:47,768
Dave!

638
00:57:49,722 --> 00:57:52,060
You're touched.

639
00:57:52,092 --> 00:57:55,711
I've missed you so much.
- I knew you would find us.

640
00:57:58,081 --> 00:58:00,227
Eleanor, what happened?

641
00:58:00,419 --> 00:58:03,878
Just a plain line.
- What?

642
00:58:03,974 --> 00:58:07,625
It does only hurts when I try to explain
.

643
00:58:07,657 --> 00:58:09,291
Do even.

644
00:58:09,387 --> 00:58:11,821
The most important thing is that you are safe.

645
00:58:30,141 --> 00:58:32,479
Everything will be fine.

646
00:58:34,337 --> 00:58:35,810
What is it?

647
00:58:35,874 --> 00:58:39,077
I thought you would never find us.

648
00:58:39,109 --> 00:58:41,575
That you did not even it was looking for.

649
00:58:41,992 --> 00:58:44,906
Why do not you search?

650
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:47,853
Because I'm such a nuisance.

651
00:58:48,269 --> 00:58:51,600
I know you find me a nuisance.

652
00:58:51,952 --> 00:58:55,828
No, anyway.
But I come anyway.

653
00:59:04,571 --> 00:59:07,806
Patriot, fermez, Napoleon.

654
00:59:07,838 --> 00:59:13,571
I don 't. You have a rich past.
We are all past when we go away.

655
00:59:13,699 --> 00:59:15,397
Uncle Ian.

656
00:59:15,781 --> 00:59:18,664
What is he doing here?
- It's a long story.

657
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:22,667
Do not worry, he does nothing.
- Yes, for a pelikaanman.

658
00:59:22,763 --> 00:59:26,575
Yes, nothing cooler than a grown man in a
pelikanenpak.

659
00:59:26,703 --> 00:59:29,714
Dave, how do we get here?

660
00:59:30,258 --> 00:59:33,301
Do not know. I think
do you control this.

661
00:59:34,806 --> 00:59:37,464
Theodore, Eleanor, and you do the rope.

662
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:42,749
Dave and Ian, we need oars.
- Simon, you and Janet provide food.

663
00:59:42,813 --> 00:59:47,649
... And Zoe - I know, I'm gonna get my balls.

664
00:59:48,098 --> 00:59:52,101
Who is that?
- Another long story.

665
00:59:54,183 --> 00:59:57,002
Keep working guys, so we
of the island cope with this.

666
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:59,404
The fleet itself does not go together.

667
01:00:26,211 --> 01:00:29,702
It's unbelievable, guys.
- Very impressive.

668
01:00:30,247 --> 01:00:34,346
Now that everyone came together to
build it, I want to say...

669
01:00:38,062 --> 01:00:40,111
It can wait.

670
01:00:40,144 --> 01:00:42,578
Where are Janet and Simon?

671
01:00:46,453 --> 01:00:49,143
Hopefully this is enough.

672
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:52,218
Have you heard anything?
- Who knows?

673
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:56,382
When I'm with you, I just
hear my heartbeat.

674
01:01:26,232 --> 01:01:28,826
Someone: Help!

675
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:37,762
Guys, here. Come quick.

676
01:01:38,435 --> 01:01:43,816
Simone, all goes well?
- Why do you call me, Simone?

677
01:01:43,976 --> 01:01:46,698
Simon?
- Of course.

678
01:01:46,794 --> 01:01:50,253
You're finally back.
- Why?

679
01:01:50,349 --> 01:01:53,712
You were bitten by a spider.
Tampered with your brains.

680
01:01:54,289 --> 01:01:59,445
I see why Dave and Ian half, half bird?

681
01:02:01,463 --> 01:02:04,954
No, me and Ian are real.
- How you doing?

682
01:02:04,986 --> 01:02:07,901
Where is Janet?
She was with you.

683
01:02:07,933 --> 01:02:12,321
Do not know.
- I did. Zoe took her.

684
01:02:12,417 --> 01:02:17,413
Simon, where did you find that golden bracelet?
- Which?

685
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:21,577
The one you gave to Janet.
- When did I do that?

686
01:02:21,833 --> 01:02:23,466
During your date.

687
01:02:23,499 --> 01:02:25,388
Are Janet and I together?

688
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:26,701
It is useless.

689
01:02:26,733 --> 01:02:30,128
Theodore and Eleanor, you are the way.

690
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:33,395
I do not remember exactly the way.

691
01:02:33,908 --> 01:02:35,701
I have.

692
01:02:35,797 --> 01:02:38,135
Which way?
- Links.

693
01:02:38,167 --> 01:02:42,075
No, right. No, left.
- You knew the way, right?

694
01:02:42,203 --> 01:02:45,502
This is true. I sometimes forget what
left and right.

695
01:02:45,534 --> 01:02:46,975
That way.

696
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:52,068
We just have to cross here.

697
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:55,588
Are you serious?
I can not.

698
01:02:55,623 --> 01:03:01,452
Simon, that you have already done.
- No, it was Simone.

699
01:03:01,484 --> 01:03:03,213
But you Simone.

700
01:03:03,245 --> 01:03:06,128
He's there somewhere in your.
You have to just search.

701
01:03:06,224 --> 01:03:09,715
Do it quickly, because Janet
needs you.

702
01:03:11,797 --> 01:03:15,544
I just can not. Sorry.

703
01:03:19,644 --> 01:03:23,487
Ian, bring everyone to the fleet.
The volcano explodes before I'm back...

704
01:03:23,583 --> 01:03:26,754
...
Promise you - that I left without you. Roger that.

705
01:03:41,871 --> 01:03:44,818
I'm with you.
- Absolutely not. Too dangerous.

706
01:03:44,882 --> 01:03:48,213
Remember when I said I
one day you would not obey?

707
01:03:49,014 --> 01:03:52,697
Sorry, Dave, but I will not obey.

708
01:03:54,587 --> 01:03:56,188
Let's go.

709
01:04:06,245 --> 01:04:11,241
You do not
up before you have all of that treasure.

710
01:04:12,074 --> 01:04:16,046
But the volcano will explode.

711
01:04:16,078 --> 01:04:18,416
Then you better hurry, huh?

712
01:04:18,448 --> 01:04:20,562
Ahead.

713
01:04:20,594 --> 01:04:23,188
Here we go.
Bags.

714
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:26,487
If so, keep going.

715
01:04:49,707 --> 01:04:51,309
Keep going.

716
01:05:02,454 --> 01:05:06,842
Pull me up.
I can not bear.

717
01:05:06,874 --> 01:05:10,590
If you can still talk, still nothing
sticks in your mouth.

718
01:05:11,102 --> 01:05:15,458
Pull me now but up.
- Yes, that sounds very good.

719
01:05:16,483 --> 01:05:17,892
Janet.

720
01:05:21,319 --> 01:05:24,394
They would be behind that waterfall.

721
01:05:25,387 --> 01:05:26,476
For example, the.

722
01:05:26,508 --> 01:05:29,038
That's what I mean.

723
01:05:29,871 --> 01:05:32,881
Zoe.
- Not one more step.

724
01:05:32,945 --> 01:05:34,771
Do not come closer.

725
01:05:34,803 --> 01:05:36,500
All right, Janet?

726
01:05:39,191 --> 01:05:41,433
I can not break free.

727
01:05:41,465 --> 01:05:43,899
The jewelry tastes terrible.

728
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:50,945
Zoe, you should not do this.
- Ten years I searched for this treasure.

729
01:05:51,041 --> 01:05:54,180
That's the reason I went
this stinking island came.

730
01:05:54,212 --> 01:05:58,023
You are here not crashed?
- They found me crazy...

731
01:05:58,055 --> 01:06:01,578
And they said this card is counterfeit.

732
01:06:01,611 --> 01:06:05,070
Now is the treasure of mine.

733
01:06:07,151 --> 01:06:08,657
Walk.

734
01:06:10,899 --> 01:06:12,692
Come.

735
01:06:12,724 --> 01:06:13,813
Ahead.

736
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:24,671
No, not yet.
- Janet.

737
01:06:25,536 --> 01:06:28,610
No!

738
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:34,856
No, help.

739
01:06:34,888 --> 01:06:40,557
You go back into that cave
to get more of that treasure.

740
01:06:49,717 --> 01:06:51,991
Simon.
- It's Simon.

741
01:07:10,375 --> 01:07:14,122
Alvin.

742
01:07:27,766 --> 01:07:30,745
Quick!
- Forward.

743
01:07:45,606 --> 01:07:46,983
Look.

744
01:07:53,901 --> 01:07:55,279
Where is Dave?

745
01:07:57,905 --> 01:08:00,499
Help me.
- Help you?

746
01:08:00,563 --> 01:08:06,232
Do I do now, Dave?
All my treasures are gone.

747
01:08:06,296 --> 01:08:08,698
Without that ruined my life.

748
01:08:08,730 --> 01:08:11,068
And now you feel how it feels.

749
01:08:11,389 --> 01:08:13,214
No, do not.

750
01:08:13,310 --> 01:08:17,314
Dave blame is simple.
I did.

751
01:08:17,378 --> 01:08:22,631
I could take revenge for all those years but
back. All that wasted energy.

752
01:08:22,727 --> 01:08:25,865
All the pizzas to be sent home.
- Was that you?

753
01:08:25,962 --> 01:08:27,531
Not now.

754
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:32,239
You can drop dead Dave and I can
to the raft with the Chipmunks...

755
01:08:32,335 --> 01:08:35,474
And their manager again
and lots of money.

756
01:08:35,506 --> 01:08:37,908
For me it does not matter.

757
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:40,214
But let me tell you something.

758
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:45,371
Hatred, anger and regret
are not members of a girl group.

759
01:08:45,467 --> 01:08:48,253
They possessed me.
And they now take possession of you.

760
01:08:48,349 --> 01:08:50,976
You can still do the right thing.

761
01:08:53,089 --> 01:08:56,260
Again, for me it does not matter.

762
01:08:56,324 --> 01:08:58,534
Your decision.

763
01:08:58,566 --> 01:09:00,136
What are you doing?

764
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:04,459
Help him, please.
Help me save my father.

765
01:09:04,491 --> 01:09:05,834
Hurry.

766
01:09:05,869 --> 01:09:09,872
I bite you, Dave.
Come on, help me.

767
01:09:18,872 --> 01:09:20,602
There they are.

768
01:09:20,634 --> 01:09:21,530
Come on.

769
01:09:29,826 --> 01:09:32,516
Come on. Hurry up.

770
01:09:44,014 --> 01:09:45,840
Grab the oar.

771
01:09:48,114 --> 01:09:49,619
Come on, guys.

772
01:09:53,463 --> 01:09:55,929
Paddling.

773
01:10:28,501 --> 01:10:32,281
Now we will never occur
during the International Music Awards.

774
01:10:32,313 --> 01:10:35,420
Now we the suckers.

775
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,331
Janet, I do not know what to say.

776
01:10:43,363 --> 01:10:48,551
I was apparently so obsessed
for that treasure, that I...

777
01:10:48,586 --> 01:10:50,409
Crazy.

778
01:10:50,505 --> 01:10:53,067
And I'm really sorry.

779
01:10:54,348 --> 01:10:55,854
We both.

780
01:10:57,039 --> 01:10:59,024
Apologies accepted.

781
01:11:02,131 --> 01:11:05,366
I want you to get it.

782
01:11:06,647 --> 01:11:07,864
Really?

783
01:11:10,554 --> 01:11:14,942
Dinmar, it's a new beginning for both of us
.

784
01:11:20,227 --> 01:11:22,501
Hope you do not mind.

785
01:11:22,981 --> 01:11:26,601
Simone gave it to me.
- That's OK.

786
01:11:26,761 --> 01:11:33,327
Not even the most beautiful jewel in the world
beauty can match.

787
01:11:41,013 --> 01:11:41,974
Yes, Alvin?

788
01:11:42,294 --> 01:11:47,259
I just wanted to say
now we...

789
01:11:47,643 --> 01:11:48,860
So do...

790
01:11:48,892 --> 01:11:52,031
I'm sorry.

791
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:56,579
Sorry that I acted childish
on the ship.

792
01:11:56,707 --> 01:12:01,031
And I ruined our family vacation.

793
01:12:01,607 --> 01:12:04,810
Sometimes a horse needs
place to walk.

794
01:12:04,842 --> 01:12:08,109
Yes, that's right.

795
01:12:08,141 --> 01:12:10,543
This is very wise.

796
01:12:12,177 --> 01:12:13,938
How you doing?

797
01:12:16,148 --> 01:12:18,166
No love for Uncle Ian?

798
01:12:18,262 --> 01:12:20,600
You put us in cages.

799
01:12:20,632 --> 01:12:22,714
Seriously? Still about?

800
01:12:22,810 --> 01:12:25,565
New topic: I saved the life of Dave.

801
01:12:25,597 --> 01:12:28,511
But I love you 'eye.

802
01:12:30,753 --> 01:12:33,443
Do you have that knife?

803
01:12:33,475 --> 01:12:37,703
Knife? Exactly, that I wanted to give back.

804
01:12:37,735 --> 01:12:40,265
Keep it with you.
- Really?

805
01:12:40,458 --> 01:12:43,660
You can
helicopter might be a sign along mail.

806
01:12:43,757 --> 01:12:45,070
What?

807
01:12:45,262 --> 01:12:49,554
We are here.
- Hello.

808
01:12:58,361 --> 01:13:01,500
Okay. We see you.

809
01:14:35,759 --> 01:14:38,610
Good to be back, huh?
- Absolutely.

810
01:14:38,866 --> 01:14:40,723
I sold the story of Zoe
to Hollywood.

811
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:43,606
They offered huge prizes.
Kyra Knigt is interested.

812
01:14:43,702 --> 01:14:45,944
There's also something in it for me.

813
01:15:09,293 --> 01:15:11,887
Thank you.

814
01:15:11,983 --> 01:15:14,193
We found the great giant.

815
01:15:16,819 --> 01:15:22,424
Simply Releases Toppers
Translation: Suurtje & Tokke

816
01:15:35,633 --> 01:15:38,940
This one is full.
We must charge you for this.

817
01:15:38,941 --> 01:15:45,111
Thinkest you $ 25 per bag?
- No, $ 25 for first bag...

818
01:15:45,112 --> 01:15:48,281
And $ 40 for each additional bag.

819
01:15:51,575 --> 01:15:55,909
Do you want the fan off? I'm cold.
- Of course.

820
01:16:01,271 --> 01:16:04,186
You have my paper crumples.
- Sorry.

821
01:16:04,221 --> 01:16:07,101
Then I read this but.
She is beautiful.

822
01:16:07,502 --> 01:16:11,464
Wait, that's me.

823
01:16:11,465 --> 01:16:14,332
Just count.

824
01:16:18,110 --> 01:16:21,519
Do you like that junglemonsterpak?
Eleonore has for me.

825
01:16:21,619 --> 01:16:26,726
Yes, I have made.
- Nice.

826
01:16:26,994 --> 01:16:29,836
Where's Alvin?
- Ladies and gentlemen...

827
01:16:29,936 --> 01:16:34,506
This is your captain.
We will leave...

828
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:37,667
To Timbuktu.
If you do not need to Timbuktu...

829
01:16:37,767 --> 01:16:42,992
Call then the stewardess
by pushing the button.

830
01:16:44,561 --> 01:16:47,979
Thank you for Air Alvin chose.
Nice flight.

831
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:51,042
Please be seated.
We ascend.

832
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:55,035
Now sit.
