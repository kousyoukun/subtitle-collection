1
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,477
Hey, wire.

2
00:02:07,548 --> 00:02:09,443
Wire. They've drawn a fence
across there.

3
00:02:09,517 --> 00:02:12,008
Them plow-pushers must have
put it up there last night.

4
00:02:12,086 --> 00:02:14,145
Give me them wire cutters.

5
00:02:24,332 --> 00:02:25,856
I'll fix this.

6
00:02:33,574 --> 00:02:34,939
Cow herders!

7
00:02:43,017 --> 00:02:44,678
Hey, cornhuskers!

8
00:03:35,336 --> 00:03:38,169
Shad Wilkins,
you've been tried and found guilty

9
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,208
of the most serious crime
west of the Pecos,

10
00:03:41,275 --> 00:03:43,106
to wit, shooting a steer.

11
00:03:44,278 --> 00:03:47,358
Got anything to say for yourself before
the sentence of the court is executed?

12
00:03:47,415 --> 00:03:49,246
I told you they shot at me first!

13
00:03:49,317 --> 00:03:51,080
I didn't mean to kill
that steer on purpose!

14
00:03:51,152 --> 00:03:52,642
I was aiming at the man.

15
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,781
It's your bad luck you missed him.
That‘s the trouble with you sodbusters,

16
00:03:56,857 --> 00:03:58,916
you can't shoot straight.

17
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:02,455
Shad,

18
00:04:03,798 --> 00:04:07,131
may the Lord have mercy
on your soul. Hey!

19
00:04:19,213 --> 00:04:21,238
Buck, I want to see you.

20
00:04:34,095 --> 00:04:36,086
Well, how‘s the hanging, there?

21
00:04:37,264 --> 00:04:39,384
Well, his neck didn't hardly
stretch a foot.

22
00:04:46,641 --> 00:04:49,303
Here‘s to the greatest woman
in the world,

23
00:04:49,377 --> 00:04:52,710
the fairest flower that ever bloomed,

24
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,805
Lily Langtry.
Miss Langtry.

25
00:04:54,882 --> 00:04:56,577
Hold it, boys.

26
00:05:00,521 --> 00:05:02,079
Did you hear the toast, stranger?

27
00:05:02,156 --> 00:05:03,919
To Lily Langtry?
I thought you meant your friends.

28
00:05:03,991 --> 00:05:05,686
I didn't know that included me.

29
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,490
That includes every man
that drinks at my bar.

30
00:05:08,562 --> 00:05:12,862
Glad to join you.
Have you ever met Miss Langtry?

31
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:17,063
No, I never met her. I never met the sun,
I never shook hands with the moon,

32
00:05:17,138 --> 00:05:19,129
and I've never been introduced
to no clouds.

33
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:24,608
That's all right. Too bad Lily Langtry
couldn't have heard that.

34
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:26,044
Did you ever see her?

35
00:05:26,113 --> 00:05:29,571
No, I was in England once,
but didn't get around to it.

36
00:05:29,917 --> 00:05:33,148
Oh, you was in England once,
and you could have seen her,

37
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,518
but you never got around to it?
Yeah.

38
00:05:37,258 --> 00:05:39,123
Get out of my bar.

39
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,194
Get out of my bar!

40
00:05:42,496 --> 00:05:44,726
To the Jersey Lily.
Miss Langtry.

41
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:46,357
Here‘s how.

42
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,028
All right, Mort, if Shad‘s good and cold,
you can have him.

43
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:33,808
$4, that‘s all he had.
I'll make it up to you on the next one.

44
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,272
Get off.

45
00:07:19,026 --> 00:07:21,654
What you got there?
A horse thief, Judge.

46
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:23,009
Prisoner of the bar.

47
00:07:23,063 --> 00:07:25,429
Get in there.
Chickenfoot, the law.

48
00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:28,559
Hear ye, hear ye, court
of Vinegarroon is now in session.

49
00:07:28,636 --> 00:07:29,728
What‘s the charge?

50
00:07:29,804 --> 00:07:32,466
We caught him on Chickenfoot‘s horse
that was stole last week.

51
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,600
My horse Pete? Where‘s he at?
Right outside.

52
00:07:40,681 --> 00:07:43,616
Well, so it is. Pete.

53
00:07:44,318 --> 00:07:47,685
No, Your Honor. I was just trying
to get the lay of the land.

54
00:07:47,755 --> 00:07:51,452
You will, too, at the end of a rope.
Southeast, no anticipating.

55
00:07:51,525 --> 00:07:55,757
Hey, Judge! Judge, that is my old
sabino pony. He‘s tied right out there.

56
00:07:57,798 --> 00:08:00,926
People of Vinegarroon again...
You can use any name you like.

57
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:03,128
Cole Harden.

58
00:08:03,204 --> 00:08:05,005
What are you doing
in Vinegarroon?

59
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,101
Oh, just passing through.
Homesteader?

60
00:08:11,545 --> 00:08:13,672
No.
Where do you hail from?

61
00:08:14,448 --> 00:08:18,077
No place in particular.
Where are you heading for?

62
00:08:18,152 --> 00:08:21,451
No place special.
Oh, saddle bum?

63
00:08:22,256 --> 00:08:25,692
Well, it's all right to live on a horse
if it's your own horse.

64
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,887
Bart, turn loose the prisoner's hands.
Chickenfoot, swear him in.

65
00:08:28,963 --> 00:08:31,397
Do you swear
to tell the truth... So help you?

66
00:08:31,465 --> 00:08:33,126
Take off your hat!

67
00:08:48,849 --> 00:08:51,147
Well, now,
I'll tell you, son...

68
00:08:51,352 --> 00:08:52,444
Are you Bean?

69
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:55,579
Judge Roy W. Bean.
My name's Jane Ellen Mathews.

70
00:08:55,656 --> 00:08:58,386
Yes, Miss Mathews, what can I do for you?

71
00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:01,394
What have you done with Shad Wilkins?
Shad Wilkins?

72
00:09:01,462 --> 00:09:02,451
He was working in the fields

73
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:05,191
when some of your Wranglers came up
and took him away.

74
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:09,464
Shad Wilkins. Shad Wilkins.

75
00:09:10,571 --> 00:09:15,702
Oh, yeah, he was hanging around out there
a while back, but he ain‘t around now.

76
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,774
Your men not only took him away,
but they tore down the fence.

77
00:09:18,846 --> 00:09:20,609
Not a stick of it was left standing.

78
00:09:20,681 --> 00:09:21,705
That so?

79
00:09:21,782 --> 00:09:24,717
Yes, that's so, and you needn't pretend
you don't know about it.

80
00:09:24,785 --> 00:09:26,878
Well, it don‘t surprise me none.

81
00:09:26,954 --> 00:09:28,834
It's against the law
to build fences hereabouts.

82
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:31,414
What law? Whose law?
Mine.

83
00:09:31,492 --> 00:09:34,359
Now, you listen to me, Mr. Bean.
Judge Bean.

84
00:09:34,428 --> 00:09:38,228
You‘re no more a judge than I am.
Just call yourself a judge.

85
00:09:38,365 --> 00:09:41,857
I wouldn't say that if I was you.
I might consider it contempt of court.

86
00:09:41,936 --> 00:09:44,871
It's contempt, all right.
You call this a court?

87
00:09:45,439 --> 00:09:48,374
I do, and it happens to be
in session right now.

88
00:09:48,442 --> 00:09:50,910
Southeast, get the young lady a chair.

89
00:09:50,978 --> 00:09:54,812
Now, you sit down, Miss Mathews,
and I'll tend to your case in a minute.

90
00:09:55,983 --> 00:09:58,747
You‘re charged with stealing a horse.
Guilty or not guilty?

91
00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:00,286
Not guilty.

92
00:10:00,354 --> 00:10:02,379
Where‘s exhibit A?

93
00:10:02,456 --> 00:10:04,356
Where‘s the horse?
Bring in the horse, Chickenfoot.

94
00:10:04,425 --> 00:10:06,723
Oh, yeah. Yeah, horse.

95
00:10:07,161 --> 00:10:10,927
Miss Mathews, when cattle can't get
to water, they die.

96
00:10:10,998 --> 00:10:12,898
There‘s miles of river on each side
of our homestead.

97
00:10:12,967 --> 00:10:17,028
This country's unfenced range land.
It always was, and always will be.

98
00:10:17,104 --> 00:10:20,164
Get in there. All right,
give me room there, you guys.

99
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,764
Come on, get in there.

100
00:10:21,842 --> 00:10:24,367
Whoa, Pete. Come on in here.

101
00:10:25,045 --> 00:10:27,377
Come on, get over there.
Give us a little room.

102
00:10:27,448 --> 00:10:29,973
All right, Judge, there he is.

103
00:10:30,884 --> 00:10:33,284
Mr. Harden, it's my duty to inform you

104
00:10:33,354 --> 00:10:37,586
that the larceny of an equine is a
capital offense, punishable By death,

105
00:10:38,342 --> 00:10:40,102
but you can rest assured that,
in this court,

106
00:10:40,127 --> 00:10:43,654
a horse thief always gets a fair trial
before he‘s hung.

107
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:47,134
Chickenfoot, that‘s your horse?

108
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,489
Oh, why, Judge...

109
00:10:48,535 --> 00:10:50,093
Can you prove it's your horse?

110
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:54,971
Why, Judge, anybody here... I can prove
it By Pete himself that he‘s my horse.

111
00:10:55,776 --> 00:10:58,244
Pete, you‘re my horse, ain‘t you?

112
00:10:58,946 --> 00:11:02,575
Ownership of horse clearly established.
It belongs to Chickenfoot.

113
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:04,344
That‘s my ruling.

114
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:07,229
Well, I don‘t contest it, Your Honor.
Maybe the horse does belong

115
00:11:07,254 --> 00:11:10,155
to Chickenfoot here, but I didn't steal it.

116
00:11:10,224 --> 00:11:11,953
How‘d you get it then?
I bought it.

117
00:11:13,127 --> 00:11:14,856
Order in the court!

118
00:11:15,362 --> 00:11:18,126
That all you got to say?
That‘s all.

119
00:11:18,198 --> 00:11:20,962
No, it's not. I'm not going to stay here
and see anybody railroaded like this.

120
00:11:21,035 --> 00:11:24,035
Miss Mathews, I don‘t recollect you was
summoned as a witness in this trial.

121
00:11:24,038 --> 00:11:25,528
What kind of a trial is it when a prisoner

122
00:11:25,606 --> 00:11:27,301
isn't even allowed to have anybody
speak for him?

123
00:11:27,374 --> 00:11:28,398
You an attorney, Miss?

124
00:11:28,475 --> 00:11:30,500
I'm as much an attorney
as you are a judge.

125
00:11:30,577 --> 00:11:31,938
You know this man?
No, I don‘t.

126
00:11:31,979 --> 00:11:33,207
You ever see him before?
No, but...

127
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,872
Can you prove he didn't steal the horse?
No.

128
00:11:34,948 --> 00:11:37,644
Then he don‘t need no lawyer then.
This man was caught on a stolen horse,

129
00:11:37,718 --> 00:11:39,481
and in this jurisdiction,
that‘s prima facie evidence.

130
00:11:39,553 --> 00:11:43,990
The case is closed and that's my ruling.
Yes, and it's just like all your rulings!

131
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,990
The courtroom will now be cleared
of everybody,

132
00:11:49,063 --> 00:11:53,090
excepting the judge, the jury, the
prisoner, the witnesses and...

133
00:11:54,201 --> 00:11:55,225
I guess that means you.

134
00:11:55,302 --> 00:11:58,499
All right, I'll go.
I don‘t want to see anymore.

135
00:11:59,173 --> 00:12:01,607
It's murder, that‘s what it is. Murder.

136
00:12:01,675 --> 00:12:03,768
This man hasn't got a chance,
and you know it,

137
00:12:03,844 --> 00:12:05,607
but you never give anybody a chance.

138
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:08,910
You didn't give us one when you
stampeded the cattle over our crops.

139
00:12:08,982 --> 00:12:11,678
You thought you'd starve
the homesteaders out, but you didn't.

140
00:12:11,752 --> 00:12:14,949
You can pester us and rob us and kill us,
but you can't stop us.

141
00:12:15,022 --> 00:12:17,582
‘Cause there‘ll always be more coming.
More and more.

142
00:12:17,658 --> 00:12:22,618
And we‘ll stay on our farms in spite of
you, and your courtroom and your killers!

143
00:12:23,564 --> 00:12:26,533
By gobs, she's all right.
She'd make a good cattleman.

144
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,125
If it wasn't for Lily, I'd marry her.

145
00:12:49,323 --> 00:12:50,323
Giddap.

146
00:12:50,757 --> 00:12:53,248
You heard the case against the accused,
pro and con.

147
00:12:53,393 --> 00:12:57,090
Now I guess maybe you'd better retire
to consider a verdict.

148
00:13:00,365 --> 00:13:02,845
Chickenfoot, you'd better take
Pete out for a little fresh air.

149
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,395
Take him out, Bart. I got work to do.

150
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:16,445
And while you retire, there‘ll be
a recess for them that‘s thirsty.

151
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:24,489
Well, I guess you can't take it with you.

152
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,759
It's got to be strictly understood

153
00:13:27,828 --> 00:13:31,320
you ain‘t making no effort to influence
the sober judgment of the jury.

154
00:13:31,398 --> 00:13:33,923
Certainly not.
There you are.

155
00:13:34,434 --> 00:13:37,835
Compliments of the prisoner.
Jury to the rear!

156
00:13:44,111 --> 00:13:45,442
Bull's-eye.

157
00:13:52,186 --> 00:13:55,053
Join me, Your Honor?
Don‘t mind if I do.

158
00:13:57,257 --> 00:14:01,250
Don‘t spill none of that liquor, son.
It eats right into the bar.

159
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:21,878
To the unfortunate lady
with the bullet in her face.

160
00:14:22,849 --> 00:14:26,216
The man that fired that bullet
was hauled out of here feet first.

161
00:14:26,787 --> 00:14:27,845
And he ought to be.

162
00:14:27,921 --> 00:14:31,015
Any man that‘d shoot at a picture
of Lily Langtry ought to be killed.

163
00:14:31,091 --> 00:14:32,285
It's just retribution.

164
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:35,692
It's justifiable homicide,
that was my ruling.

165
00:14:35,762 --> 00:14:36,922
Right.

166
00:14:41,802 --> 00:14:43,963
You an admirer of Miss Lily's, too?

167
00:14:44,571 --> 00:14:47,199
Well, that‘s putting it mildly.

168
00:14:49,643 --> 00:14:52,476
She's the most beautiful woman
I ever met.

169
00:14:54,014 --> 00:14:55,072
Met?

170
00:14:57,184 --> 00:15:00,813
You mean to tell me you met Lily Langtry,
the real her, in the flesh?

171
00:15:00,887 --> 00:15:02,411
Oh, many times.

172
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,517
What an actress.

173
00:15:08,262 --> 00:15:10,287
How‘d you get to know her?

174
00:15:12,165 --> 00:15:14,656
Well, that‘s a long story, Judge.

175
00:15:16,837 --> 00:15:19,863
Bart, you and Blackjack
get yourself a drink?

176
00:15:22,609 --> 00:15:24,702
Mighty fine liquor. What do you call it?

177
00:15:24,778 --> 00:15:28,111
Rub of the brush. Go on.
Rub of the brush?

178
00:15:28,215 --> 00:15:31,742
Did you get to know her real well?
It's got character.

179
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:38,587
I said, did you get to know her real well?

180
00:15:40,494 --> 00:15:45,761
Now, Judge, you forget a gentleman
never discusses a lady in a barroom.

181
00:15:45,832 --> 00:15:48,824
Who said it's a barroom?
This is a courtroom.

182
00:15:50,771 --> 00:15:54,002
Say, tell me,
is she as pretty as them pictures?

183
00:15:55,742 --> 00:15:59,735
Why, the picture's never been made
that can do justice to Lily Langtry.

184
00:15:59,813 --> 00:16:01,542
Is she good-nurtured?

185
00:16:04,284 --> 00:16:05,683
An angel.

186
00:16:10,524 --> 00:16:13,687
I'll never forget the night we met.
Yeah?

187
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,526
I'll never forget it as long as I live.

188
00:16:40,487 --> 00:16:41,487
Who was that?

189
00:16:41,555 --> 00:16:44,615
Oh, that‘s Mort Borrow.
He cleans up around here.

190
00:16:45,025 --> 00:16:46,652
Go on about Lily.

191
00:16:50,764 --> 00:16:52,231
Oh, yeah, Lily.

192
00:16:59,606 --> 00:17:00,903
How about a verdict?

193
00:17:00,974 --> 00:17:04,034
Can't you see
we're still considering the evidence?

194
00:17:05,178 --> 00:17:08,147
Two aces.
Bet a dollar and a half.

195
00:17:08,215 --> 00:17:09,614
Stay once.

196
00:17:10,484 --> 00:17:13,385
Get away from here.
You smell of formaldehyde!

197
00:17:13,453 --> 00:17:15,011
I'll call that.

198
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:17,399
You been down around Lanno Bay,
ain‘t you?

199
00:17:17,424 --> 00:17:18,755
Sure.

200
00:17:18,825 --> 00:17:21,760
Well, you know how it is at sunset.

201
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:27,664
You can look out and that water ain‘t
exactly blue, and it ain‘t exactly purple.

202
00:17:28,402 --> 00:17:32,361
It's a kind of color a man can feel,
but he can't put a name to.

203
00:17:32,439 --> 00:17:33,531
Yeah.

204
00:17:35,675 --> 00:17:37,700
Well, that's Lily's eyes.

205
00:17:40,113 --> 00:17:41,375
By gobs!

206
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:50,881
I'm out.
I'll stay out. Here we go.

207
00:17:51,892 --> 00:17:54,417
Got 10. Got a nine.

208
00:17:54,494 --> 00:17:59,295
You know how bright
and coppery and gold-like

209
00:17:59,366 --> 00:18:02,301
a young chestnut horse
is running in the bright sun?

210
00:18:02,369 --> 00:18:06,328
Yeah.
Well, her hair is something like that.

211
00:18:09,075 --> 00:18:10,599
In the daytime.

212
00:18:11,845 --> 00:18:13,312
You mean it's different at night?

213
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,781
Well, not different,
but just sort of more so.

214
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,117
How so?
Well...

215
00:18:21,288 --> 00:18:26,248
Well, you know how it is at dusk when you
see a prairie fire reflected in the sky.

216
00:18:27,227 --> 00:18:32,859
A sort of a deep...
A beautiful kind of blushing...

217
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,994
Red?
Red.

218
00:18:36,536 --> 00:18:41,166
Well, that‘ll give you a rough idea.
By gobs.

219
00:18:46,346 --> 00:18:48,473
I got a lock of her hair.

220
00:18:52,118 --> 00:18:55,986
You mean to tell me you actually got
the real... From her head?

221
00:19:01,928 --> 00:19:04,556
I don't suppose you'd ever part
with that lock of hair,

222
00:19:04,631 --> 00:19:07,361
no matter what a man was willing to give?

223
00:19:09,035 --> 00:19:11,526
A man don‘t trade things like that.

224
00:19:15,509 --> 00:19:17,636
You see that sword up there?

225
00:19:18,144 --> 00:19:21,841
I wore it in the civil war.
Always meant to be buried with it.

226
00:19:21,915 --> 00:19:24,213
Now, if you was willing to swap, why...

227
00:19:26,152 --> 00:19:27,983
Would you really like to have it?

228
00:19:28,054 --> 00:19:32,184
I'd rather own it than the state of Texas.
Let‘s have a look at it.

229
00:19:34,895 --> 00:19:36,886
I haven't got it with me.

230
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,656
Where‘s it at?

231
00:19:42,969 --> 00:19:45,199
It's with my stuff in El Paso.

232
00:19:45,272 --> 00:19:48,571
So, you was in the civil war, Judge?

233
00:19:48,642 --> 00:19:50,667
El Paso?
Yeah.

234
00:19:52,212 --> 00:19:55,375
Cavalry?
I suppose you could write for it.

235
00:19:58,084 --> 00:19:59,415
Yeah.

236
00:19:59,486 --> 00:20:02,421
Wouldn't take long to get here
By mail coach.

237
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:04,620
Oh, two, three weeks.

238
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,126
Two or three weeks?
Yeah, about.

239
00:20:27,714 --> 00:20:31,946
But I wouldn't part with that lock of hair
for anything in the world.

240
00:20:41,027 --> 00:20:42,961
The jury's ready, Judge.

241
00:20:43,226 --> 00:20:45,106
That bottle of whiskey
gone already?

242
00:20:45,131 --> 00:20:49,261
Yeah, and if he ain‘t paid for it,
you better start collecting now.

243
00:21:01,648 --> 00:21:05,243
What‘s the verdict?
You know what the verdict is. Guilty.

244
00:21:11,224 --> 00:21:13,556
There‘s only one thing I can do.

245
00:21:13,627 --> 00:21:16,357
You‘re sentenced to hang,
that‘s my ruling.

246
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:17,828
Turn loose the prisoner's hands.

247
00:21:17,897 --> 00:21:21,424
But, Judge, you just ruled...
I didn't finish my ruling.

248
00:21:23,903 --> 00:21:26,667
The court sentenced the prisoner to hang,

249
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,368
but the court didn't say when.
So long as there's reasonable doubt...

250
00:21:30,443 --> 00:21:32,138
What reasonable doubt, Judge?

251
00:21:32,212 --> 00:21:33,932
We just caught him
with Chickenfoot's horse.

252
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,278
Ain‘t any room for doubt.
Order!

253
00:21:38,551 --> 00:21:42,578
I been talking to the prisoner.
He‘s a friend of Lily Langtry‘s.

254
00:21:43,623 --> 00:21:47,821
Stands to reason no friend of Lily Langtry
goes around stealing horses.

255
00:21:47,894 --> 00:21:49,691
Leastways, there‘s a reasonable doubt.

256
00:21:49,763 --> 00:21:51,856
You mean,
you‘re setting aside your own ruling?

257
00:21:51,931 --> 00:21:54,991
That ain‘t what I said.
When I make a ruling, it stands.

258
00:21:55,068 --> 00:21:56,695
But, Judge, you just sentenced the man.

259
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,601
His sentence is suspended

260
00:21:58,672 --> 00:22:01,300
for a couple weeks
until I can look into the matter further.

261
00:22:01,374 --> 00:22:03,001
That‘s my ruling.

262
00:22:17,691 --> 00:22:20,819
Hi, Mort. How‘s business?
Just lost a customer.

263
00:22:21,084 --> 00:22:22,804
Well, I'll be down for a shave in a minute.

264
00:22:22,829 --> 00:22:24,729
All right, you‘re next.

265
00:22:35,175 --> 00:22:37,439
Howdy, Judge.
Hello, Evans.

266
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,273
Jersey Lily special.

267
00:22:53,293 --> 00:22:56,922
Pardon me, you don‘t happen
to have a twin brother, do you?

268
00:22:56,996 --> 00:22:58,588
No, not me.

269
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:02,760
Well, you'd better pay me that money
you owe me.

270
00:23:02,969 --> 00:23:05,767
You‘re loco, brother.
I don‘t owe you nothing.

271
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:07,363
You owe me $60.

272
00:23:12,645 --> 00:23:13,771
$60.

273
00:24:08,468 --> 00:24:11,562
If you‘re interested, that‘s the man
that sold me the roan horse.

274
00:24:11,638 --> 00:24:13,936
Then, he‘s the man that stole...

275
00:24:55,481 --> 00:24:57,881
$84 and 6 bits.

276
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,459
Fined $80 for disorderly conduct,

277
00:25:08,528 --> 00:25:11,691
and $4 and 6 bits
for carrying concealed weapons.

278
00:25:12,632 --> 00:25:14,827
Now, you men get some rope
and string him up.

279
00:25:14,901 --> 00:25:17,529
String him up? Why, he‘s dead already.

280
00:25:17,937 --> 00:25:20,997
We hang horse thieves, don‘t we?
String him up!

281
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:23,770
Come inside, son.

282
00:25:29,582 --> 00:25:32,016
You can have his horse and outfit.

283
00:25:39,792 --> 00:25:42,317
Rub of the brush?
Rub of the brush.

284
00:25:48,268 --> 00:25:50,566
El Paso.
El Paso.

285
00:29:59,552 --> 00:30:01,315
Good morning, Judge.

286
00:30:02,255 --> 00:30:03,688
Who are you?

287
00:30:07,727 --> 00:30:10,719
Who are you? What are you doing here?

288
00:30:17,537 --> 00:30:19,801
Stranger. Stranger, come here.

289
00:30:21,541 --> 00:30:24,510
Straighten out my neck, would you?
Grab a hold of my head.

290
00:30:25,545 --> 00:30:26,739
Now, jerk it quick.

291
00:30:28,581 --> 00:30:31,379
Thank you. It's my neck.

292
00:30:33,352 --> 00:30:37,118
You see I was hung once,
but my friends cut me down in time.

293
00:30:37,623 --> 00:30:41,423
Now when I don‘t live right,
why, the crick comes back on me.

294
00:31:01,214 --> 00:31:04,513
Now, who are you, anyhow?
And what are you doing here?

295
00:31:05,885 --> 00:31:07,978
Why, don‘t you remember?

296
00:31:08,521 --> 00:31:10,785
Why, I'm the fellow
that filled the inside straight,

297
00:31:10,856 --> 00:31:12,653
and won Chickenfoot's horse.

298
00:31:15,995 --> 00:31:17,553
So long, Judge.

299
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,807
Hey, Pete, are you glad
I won you from Chickenfoot?

300
00:31:31,177 --> 00:31:33,168
Well, that makes it nice.

301
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:34,779
Here.

302
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,391
Wait!

303
00:33:30,463 --> 00:33:31,862
Wait!

304
00:34:21,113 --> 00:34:23,411
That lock of hair, Lily's hair,

305
00:34:25,785 --> 00:34:30,722
you promised to write to El Paso for it.
Don‘t you remember? We drank on it.

306
00:34:31,724 --> 00:34:33,851
When are you going to do it?

307
00:34:43,702 --> 00:34:47,832
You ain‘t going to crawfish?
No, the first post office I come to.

308
00:34:48,908 --> 00:34:51,308
Straighten her out, would you, son?

309
00:34:54,146 --> 00:34:55,511
Thank you.

310
00:35:05,257 --> 00:35:08,818
You mangy old scorpion,
you might have got us both killed.

311
00:35:21,373 --> 00:35:25,104
What you want to go to California for?
See the Pacific Ocean.

312
00:35:25,177 --> 00:35:27,975
It's just like the gulf down at Lanno Bay.

313
00:35:28,314 --> 00:35:29,679
It's bigger.

314
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:33,749
Why don‘t you stay around
Vinegarroon awhile?

315
00:35:33,853 --> 00:35:37,653
We could have a lot of fun together.
We could talk about Lily and...

316
00:35:37,723 --> 00:35:40,487
No, I'm on my way.

317
00:35:42,228 --> 00:35:43,422
Listen,

318
00:35:45,297 --> 00:35:48,357
it's a great country here,
west of the Pecos.

319
00:35:48,434 --> 00:35:51,062
A fellow could really make something
of himself.

320
00:35:51,136 --> 00:35:53,934
Why, when I first come here,
I didn't have nothing.

321
00:35:54,006 --> 00:35:56,497
Now, I'm boss of the whole section.

322
00:35:57,209 --> 00:35:59,837
Well, that‘s mighty fine, Judge.

323
00:36:00,913 --> 00:36:03,882
You know, I cottoned to you
the first time I seen you.

324
00:36:03,949 --> 00:36:05,974
Why don‘t you put in with me?

325
00:36:06,051 --> 00:36:09,282
Well, I tell you, Judge,
it's nice of you to ask me,

326
00:36:09,355 --> 00:36:15,385
but I'm heading for California,
and nothing short of hanging can stop me.

327
00:36:16,962 --> 00:36:21,160
Wait a minute. You can't go.
You're under suspended sentence.

328
00:36:21,233 --> 00:36:23,394
Why, you hung Mr. Evans for that.

329
00:36:23,469 --> 00:36:25,460
You‘re under suspendence, anyhow.

330
00:36:25,538 --> 00:36:28,699
Who are you? What do I know about you?
How do I know they ain‘t looking for you?

331
00:36:28,741 --> 00:36:33,508
You‘re under arrest for disorderly conduct,
for disturbing the peace, vagrancy,

332
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:36,844
and you‘re on the way back to town
with me, and that‘s my ruling!

333
00:36:36,916 --> 00:36:38,440
So long, Judge.

334
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:02,230
By gobs, he stole my gun.

335
00:37:12,017 --> 00:37:14,645
We hired out for farm work, Miss,
not a civil war.

336
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,688
This ain‘t no fit place to homestead in.

337
00:37:16,755 --> 00:37:18,780
Land's no good when there's
always lead flying over it.

338
00:37:18,857 --> 00:37:20,620
If you'd shoot back,
maybe they'd stop bothering you.

339
00:37:20,693 --> 00:37:21,785
We did shoot back.

340
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:25,057
And so did Shad Wilkins,
and he ain‘t trying it no more.

341
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:27,030
What about your own quarter section?

342
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:29,659
If you leave, you'll lose it.
We don't want no part of it.

343
00:37:29,735 --> 00:37:31,430
All right, Hod. If you feel that way,

344
00:37:31,503 --> 00:37:34,028
we‘ll try to get along
with just Eph and Henry.

345
00:37:34,106 --> 00:37:35,300
Not me.

346
00:37:37,376 --> 00:37:41,506
Henry, if we only had one man,
it'd be a big help.

347
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,309
Sorry, Mr. Mathews.

348
00:37:52,391 --> 00:37:54,188
Call themselves men.

349
00:38:02,234 --> 00:38:04,327
Wade, what do we do?

350
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:13,937
I know what to do.
No, no, wait. That‘s not the way.

351
00:38:14,013 --> 00:38:15,878
Don‘t even think of it.

352
00:38:17,716 --> 00:38:20,617
Wade, aren't you going to stay for supper?

353
00:38:21,053 --> 00:38:22,520
I'll be back.

354
00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:38,627
Well, they left.

355
00:38:38,704 --> 00:38:40,604
Of course they have. What did you expect?

356
00:38:40,673 --> 00:38:42,504
My hands quit, too.
You can't blame them for leaving.

357
00:38:42,574 --> 00:38:44,565
There won't be a hired man left
in this part of the country

358
00:38:44,643 --> 00:38:46,076
if we don‘t do something about it.

359
00:38:46,145 --> 00:38:48,477
We hire new hands,
same thing will happen.

360
00:38:48,547 --> 00:38:50,447
What‘s old Mathews going to say about it?

361
00:38:50,516 --> 00:38:53,485
He keeps passing the buck
to the Lord Jehovah.

362
00:38:53,552 --> 00:38:55,486
I say, let‘s do something
about it ourselves.

363
00:38:55,554 --> 00:38:57,385
That‘s right.
That‘s what I like to hear.

364
00:38:57,456 --> 00:38:59,856
Let‘s give the judge the same thing
he gave Shad Wilkins.

365
00:39:00,392 --> 00:39:04,385
Maybe if some of us went down
and appealed to Roy Bean for justice...

366
00:39:04,463 --> 00:39:08,627
Justice. If you'd seen him yesterday,
pretending to try that prisoner...

367
00:39:08,701 --> 00:39:10,362
The man didn't have a chance.

368
00:39:10,436 --> 00:39:13,462
I wonder if they hanged him.
Don‘t they always?

369
00:39:13,539 --> 00:39:16,474
He was the same as dead
even while he stood there.

370
00:39:16,542 --> 00:39:19,136
I've kept on seeing his face all day.

371
00:39:27,386 --> 00:39:28,683
What is it, Daughter?

372
00:39:28,754 --> 00:39:32,315
The man I told you about,
the one that was hanged.

373
00:39:32,391 --> 00:39:35,451
I saw him plain as day,
looking in the window.

374
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:42,461
You‘re seeing things, Jane Ellen.
There‘s nobody out there.

375
00:39:42,568 --> 00:39:44,695
I saw his face, I tell you.

376
00:39:49,108 --> 00:39:50,666
Come in.

377
00:39:52,611 --> 00:39:54,101
Good evening.

378
00:40:02,788 --> 00:40:04,619
Pardon me for intruding like this.

379
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:10,185
Oh, no, you‘re not. It's
just... Well, I thought you were a ghost.

380
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:14,663
Well, I guess
you‘re partly to blame I'm not.

381
00:40:14,733 --> 00:40:18,692
I just stopped in to thank you.
Father, this is Mister...

382
00:40:18,771 --> 00:40:22,263
Harden.
Welcome, Mr. Harden, welcome.

383
00:40:22,674 --> 00:40:24,301
Glad to meet you.

384
00:40:26,378 --> 00:40:29,541
Oh, Mr. Harden,
this is our neighbor Wade Harper.

385
00:40:29,815 --> 00:40:32,113
This is the man I told you about.

386
00:40:32,184 --> 00:40:35,051
You mean to tell me Bean tried you,
and let you go?

387
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,021
Well, she was my lawyer.
I guess she's the one that got me off.

388
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:40,422
I knew you weren't a horse thief.
Thanks.

389
00:40:41,794 --> 00:40:43,659
How did you know that?

390
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,754
I just knew.

391
00:40:47,299 --> 00:40:49,290
Are you working anywhere?

392
00:40:50,702 --> 00:40:54,160
No, I'm heading for California.

393
00:40:54,873 --> 00:41:00,436
Mr. Harden, I suppose a body that‘s just
been hanged is apt to be a bit hungry.

394
00:41:00,512 --> 00:41:02,503
You must stay for supper.

395
00:41:06,351 --> 00:41:09,479
Well, I don‘t want to put you out any.
Oh, no, not at all.

396
00:41:09,555 --> 00:41:12,581
Matter of fact, we had some company
that just disappointed us.

397
00:41:12,658 --> 00:41:16,059
We were hoping somebody‘d
show up to take their place.

398
00:41:16,128 --> 00:41:19,359
Make yourself at home, now.
Make yourself at home.

399
00:41:24,269 --> 00:41:28,000
Wait till you sink your teeth
into some of Jane Ellen's stew.

400
00:41:36,181 --> 00:41:41,346
Oh, Lord, for that which thou
hast sent us in our hour of need,

401
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,312
make us truly grateful.

402
00:41:44,756 --> 00:41:49,591
Bless this food to our use and ourselves
to thy service. Amen.

403
00:41:50,495 --> 00:41:52,087
Let me help you.

404
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,624
How about some hominy?

405
00:41:55,701 --> 00:41:57,362
Here, Wade. Give him some milk.
All right, all right.

406
00:41:57,436 --> 00:41:59,199
Give him some milk.

407
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:04,172
I think he likes it here.
I think we got him.

408
00:42:04,243 --> 00:42:06,677
What‘s he doing now?
Feeding his horse.

409
00:42:06,745 --> 00:42:11,512
Wade, he could probably take the place
of two men. He‘s so big and strong.

410
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:14,984
Well, I don‘t know how strong he is.
Strong enough, Wade.

411
00:42:15,053 --> 00:42:17,681
Now, Jane Ellen,
we‘ll leave you alone with him,

412
00:42:17,756 --> 00:42:19,986
and you kind of add on
a little more welcome.

413
00:42:20,058 --> 00:42:22,652
What‘ll I say?
Oh, just keep smiling at him.

414
00:42:22,728 --> 00:42:27,461
And, Daughter,
if it should come up natural-like,

415
00:42:27,532 --> 00:42:30,831
you might hint
what a handsome man he is.

416
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:32,698
Handsome?

417
00:42:32,771 --> 00:42:36,969
We need him terribly bad, Daughter.
We got to get that corn husked.

418
00:42:37,109 --> 00:42:39,009
We need him terribly bad.

419
00:42:39,077 --> 00:42:41,443
Listen, your father don‘t
mean for you to... Shh.

420
00:42:41,513 --> 00:42:42,810
Look out.

421
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:46,715
Everything all right, Mr. Harden?

422
00:42:46,785 --> 00:42:49,583
Fine, thanks.
Good. Now, I'll go see about your bunk.

423
00:42:49,655 --> 00:42:52,453
Oh, don‘t trouble.
No trouble at all. Come on, Wade.

424
00:43:06,038 --> 00:43:07,903
Can I give you a hand?
Oh, no, thanks.

425
00:43:08,607 --> 00:43:12,304
Won‘t you sit down, please?
Well, I won't argue with you.

426
00:43:12,945 --> 00:43:15,914
If I had to wash dishes,
I guess I'd give up eating.

427
00:43:15,981 --> 00:43:18,609
Well, what do you do
about the dishes when you‘re home?

428
00:43:18,684 --> 00:43:20,845
Home? What? You mean in a house?

429
00:43:21,219 --> 00:43:23,119
Well, you live in a house, don‘t you?

430
00:43:23,288 --> 00:43:28,658
No. No, my house is all out there,
all one room with a sky for a roof.

431
00:43:29,828 --> 00:43:33,662
Well, it's a big place.
Got some space to rent.

432
00:43:35,667 --> 00:43:38,727
Well, I guess California's
your next stop?

433
00:43:38,837 --> 00:43:44,207
California, but I don‘t stop.
Oregon next, I guess.

434
00:43:44,443 --> 00:43:47,503
Well, all places aren't just the same.

435
00:43:47,646 --> 00:43:51,173
Wouldn't you rather stay
a little longer in some places?

436
00:43:51,249 --> 00:43:53,979
No, they‘re all the same,
beautiful when you leave them.

437
00:43:54,353 --> 00:43:57,720
Well, it's like the turtles.
Carry their houses with them.

438
00:43:57,789 --> 00:44:00,189
If I had to build me a house,
I'd have it on wheels.

439
00:44:00,625 --> 00:44:05,153
Not me. I'd want my house
so that nothing could ever move it.

440
00:44:05,697 --> 00:44:08,495
So down deep
that an earthquake couldn't shake it,

441
00:44:09,234 --> 00:44:12,260
and a cyclone would be
just another wind going By.

442
00:44:14,539 --> 00:44:18,600
Well, you say, "Who wants to be a turtle?"

443
00:44:19,411 --> 00:44:23,142
And I say, "l hope you'll be
very happy in your house."

444
00:44:32,491 --> 00:44:36,757
Well...
Oh, say, wait a minute.

445
00:44:36,828 --> 00:44:38,159
What?

446
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:40,596
I'll bet I know something
we could agree on.

447
00:44:40,665 --> 00:44:41,757
What‘s that?

448
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:44,768
Well, in about a week now,
we‘re going to husk the corn,

449
00:44:45,504 --> 00:44:47,563
and I'll bet you'll agree that that's fun.

450
00:44:48,707 --> 00:44:51,904
Well, you know, I think husking
corn‘s the greatest fun in the world.

451
00:44:52,711 --> 00:44:55,236
Husking corn, fun?
Oh, yes!

452
00:44:56,681 --> 00:45:00,344
Well, I'd rather wash dishes.
Oh, no.

453
00:45:02,387 --> 00:45:06,653
It was a fine supper, and good cooking.

454
00:45:09,995 --> 00:45:11,553
Oh, Mr. Harden.

455
00:45:18,703 --> 00:45:20,967
What a handsome man you are.

456
00:45:26,678 --> 00:45:28,646
I doubt that, but I'm a tired one.

457
00:45:28,713 --> 00:45:32,080
Well, I hope I see you
in the morning before I leave.

458
00:45:39,458 --> 00:45:41,619
Get out of here! Hey!

459
00:45:52,838 --> 00:45:55,830
If anybody‘d told me yesterday
I'd be playing tag in a cornfield

460
00:45:55,907 --> 00:45:57,898
with a lot of cows...

461
00:45:58,276 --> 00:46:00,540
If we had some men that would ride fence,

462
00:46:00,612 --> 00:46:03,513
there wouldn't be any cows
in the cornfield.

463
00:46:06,118 --> 00:46:08,313
You were sure cute last night.

464
00:46:09,721 --> 00:46:11,120
Now you‘re making fun of me.

465
00:46:11,189 --> 00:46:14,784
Well, that‘s...
That‘s more fun than picking corn.

466
00:46:21,066 --> 00:46:23,899
Hey, look at your father.
I wonder what‘s up.

467
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:34,270
I tried to stop them.
They wouldn't listen to me.

468
00:46:34,346 --> 00:46:35,346
Wade!

469
00:46:35,413 --> 00:46:37,973
Yes, yes.
It's the wrong and lawless thing to do.

470
00:46:38,049 --> 00:46:41,712
I begged them not to. I told them.
Who? What happened?

471
00:46:41,786 --> 00:46:44,118
Wade Harper has rounded up
some of the men.

472
00:46:44,189 --> 00:46:46,350
They going to town to lynch Judge Bean.

473
00:46:46,424 --> 00:46:48,255
When did they leave?
About an hour ago.

474
00:46:48,326 --> 00:46:49,657
They took our wagon.

475
00:47:47,118 --> 00:47:49,518
Thunder and lightning!
You back from California already?

476
00:47:49,588 --> 00:47:51,385
You got to get out of here,
and don‘t stop for nothing.

477
00:47:51,456 --> 00:47:52,456
Did you write to El Paso?

478
00:47:52,524 --> 00:47:54,822
Listen, just get on your horse and get,
because they‘re after you.

479
00:47:54,893 --> 00:47:57,487
Did you write? Who's after me?

480
00:47:57,662 --> 00:47:59,789
The homesteaders.
They‘re going to string you up.

481
00:48:00,365 --> 00:48:02,128
Why, that bunch of plow-pushing sod!

482
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,668
They‘re outside right now,
a whole wagon-load of them.

483
00:48:04,736 --> 00:48:07,933
A wagon-load?
Why, I can handle a train load of them.

484
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,399
I'll tear their livers out.

485
00:48:34,566 --> 00:48:35,897
What‘ll it be, gentlemen?

486
00:48:36,368 --> 00:48:38,996
It'll be Roy Bean. Where is he?

487
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:42,368
He‘s out for a while.

488
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:46,938
That‘s because you came down here
and warned him.

489
00:49:00,825 --> 00:49:02,986
Make a move and I'll kill you.

490
00:49:06,631 --> 00:49:08,656
Cole, start collecting them shotguns,

491
00:49:11,069 --> 00:49:14,470
uncork them rifles now
and set them down this end of the bar,

492
00:49:14,539 --> 00:49:15,539
easy-like.

493
00:49:17,175 --> 00:49:18,802
Go on.

494
00:49:25,383 --> 00:49:28,511
Get back. Get back.

495
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:48,063
Now, I'll take yours, Judge.

496
00:50:31,683 --> 00:50:33,082
The drinks are on me, gentlemen.

497
00:50:37,689 --> 00:50:40,419
We‘re not drinking with you, Harden,
nor him, either.

498
00:50:40,892 --> 00:50:44,055
I ain‘t serving none of my liquor
to no bunch of tomato-kissing,

499
00:50:44,129 --> 00:50:46,427
plow-pushing...
Now, Judge,

500
00:50:46,765 --> 00:50:50,132
we don‘t want any harsh words
to spoil this friendly little get-together.

501
00:50:50,201 --> 00:50:51,395
Get-together?

502
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:55,865
Why, this pack of weasels invade
the dignity of my courtroom,

503
00:50:56,641 --> 00:51:00,008
come in here armed with malice
aforethought to kick up a rumpus...

504
00:51:00,178 --> 00:51:04,638
Now, look, you being a judge, you know
there‘s always two sides to any question.

505
00:51:05,316 --> 00:51:07,409
These men have come here
with a legitimate grievance.

506
00:51:07,485 --> 00:51:09,680
We‘re not asking you to speak
for us, Harden.

507
00:51:09,821 --> 00:51:11,061
No, nor me, either.

508
00:51:12,357 --> 00:51:15,520
Well, that makes it unanimous.
I'm going to talk for the both of you.

509
00:51:17,762 --> 00:51:19,559
There‘s a law here against fencing land

510
00:51:19,631 --> 00:51:22,600
that seems nothing short of murder
to people raising crops,

511
00:51:22,967 --> 00:51:24,901
but it's common sense
to men running cattle.

512
00:51:27,372 --> 00:51:28,930
I've seen this kind of war before.

513
00:51:29,007 --> 00:51:31,339
It's happening now,
back in Kansas and Nebraska.

514
00:51:32,277 --> 00:51:33,938
The cattlemen came in first,

515
00:51:34,012 --> 00:51:36,742
then the homesteaders moved in
and fenced them out.

516
00:51:36,815 --> 00:51:41,047
They had crops for one year,
and then a dry spell, drought,

517
00:51:41,653 --> 00:51:42,881
so the homesteaders moved out,

518
00:51:42,954 --> 00:51:45,388
and the rush and thistle
and jimson moved in.

519
00:51:45,457 --> 00:51:48,324
And the big spaces were all broken
up By little quarter sections,

520
00:51:49,394 --> 00:51:50,594
and the homesteads left empty,

521
00:51:50,662 --> 00:51:53,927
and the houses caved in,
and the land, no good for man or cattle.

522
00:51:53,998 --> 00:51:56,796
You spoiled the land,
then you came here to spoil this land.

523
00:51:56,868 --> 00:51:58,267
This here‘s a big country.

524
00:51:58,336 --> 00:52:01,577
Yea, but it ain‘t big enough for cattlemen
and homesteaders, and it never will be.

525
00:52:01,639 --> 00:52:04,938
Now, clear out here. That‘s my ruling.

526
00:52:07,812 --> 00:52:10,303
All right, Bean, we‘re going.

527
00:52:11,149 --> 00:52:13,709
We‘re going back to build our fences.

528
00:52:13,952 --> 00:52:17,683
If you do, you better build coffins
along with them. Now, get.

529
00:53:08,406 --> 00:53:10,431
You sure told them off, son.

530
00:53:11,543 --> 00:53:13,374
Yep, and now I'm going to tell you off.

531
00:53:13,444 --> 00:53:15,708
I'm sorry I stopped them
from lynching you.

532
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:17,805
They got a right
to defend their homesteads.

533
00:53:17,982 --> 00:53:20,576
You know this ain‘t homestead land.
You just said so yourself.

534
00:53:20,652 --> 00:53:23,985
The government didn't say so.
I'm the government here.

535
00:53:24,055 --> 00:53:27,183
Judas Priest, I don‘t see how you can
talk up for scum like that.

536
00:53:27,258 --> 00:53:29,419
They proved up on their land,
and they got deeds to it.

537
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:31,180
When you make war on them,
you‘re making war

538
00:53:31,229 --> 00:53:33,424
on their women and kids, too.

539
00:53:33,965 --> 00:53:35,566
Those people were starved out last year.

540
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,592
I heard about those cattle being
stampeded over their crops,

541
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:41,605
and there‘s too many strays running loose
in that valley right now,

542
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:43,636
only they‘re not strays.

543
00:53:45,209 --> 00:53:47,010
What do you want me to do?
Arrest them cattle,

544
00:53:47,011 --> 00:53:49,445
and fine them a couple dollars apiece
for trespass?

545
00:53:50,915 --> 00:53:51,915
Now, look,

546
00:53:52,817 --> 00:53:57,220
those people don‘t take up much room with
their little shirt-sized pieces of land.

547
00:53:58,222 --> 00:54:01,055
Why don‘t you be a real judge
for all of the people?

548
00:54:02,393 --> 00:54:05,829
Why don‘t you try to see their side of it,
and help them instead of fight them?

549
00:54:06,864 --> 00:54:09,492
Make peace around here instead of war.

550
00:54:10,301 --> 00:54:14,499
There‘s plenty of room for everybody,
then everybody‘d look up to you.

551
00:54:16,941 --> 00:54:20,274
And then someday, maybe they'd put up
a statue out there in the street,

552
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:27,140
a statue with a carving on it.
"To Roy Bean, the real judge."

553
00:54:29,754 --> 00:54:31,915
What are you doing? Catching a fish?

554
00:54:33,491 --> 00:54:34,788
I guess I'm wasting my time.

555
00:54:34,859 --> 00:54:37,089
Hold on, wait a minute.
You write that letter to El Paso yet?

556
00:54:37,161 --> 00:54:40,062
No!
You promised. We drank on it.

557
00:54:41,165 --> 00:54:43,326
I didn't have to write it.
I had it on me all the time.

558
00:54:43,368 --> 00:54:45,700
You did?
Well, why didn't you give it to me then?

559
00:54:46,904 --> 00:54:50,203
You old bullhead, if I'd have given it
to you, you'd have hung me.

560
00:54:50,274 --> 00:54:51,764
Wouldn't you?

561
00:54:52,043 --> 00:54:55,444
I might‘ve at that. Let's have a look
at it. I haven't got it with me.

562
00:54:55,513 --> 00:54:57,504
Suffering, bleeding Chickamauga!
Where‘s it at?

563
00:54:57,815 --> 00:55:00,010
I left it over at the Mathews‘ place.

564
00:55:00,218 --> 00:55:01,583
How is she?

565
00:55:01,719 --> 00:55:03,949
I'll ride right over with you.
No, no.

566
00:55:04,789 --> 00:55:07,485
You mean you‘re gonna crawfish?
You ain‘t going to give it to me?

567
00:55:07,592 --> 00:55:09,822
Sure, I'll give it to you.
When?

568
00:55:10,361 --> 00:55:13,057
When the last steers out of the valley.

569
00:55:13,297 --> 00:55:15,356
All right, I'll pass the word around
to the boys.

570
00:55:15,433 --> 00:55:18,095
No, you don‘t.
You‘re going to help run those cattle out,

571
00:55:18,169 --> 00:55:21,400
and I'm going along
with you to see that it's done.

572
00:55:21,673 --> 00:55:23,664
Don‘t you trust me, Cole?

573
00:55:25,009 --> 00:55:26,772
When I was a kid, I had a pet rattlesnake.

574
00:55:26,844 --> 00:55:30,177
I was fond of it,
but I wouldn't turn my back on it.

575
00:55:33,251 --> 00:55:34,616
You‘re all right.

576
00:55:35,386 --> 00:55:38,549
I'm going back now,
and gathering my stuff for the roundup.

577
00:55:40,958 --> 00:55:44,155
And that lock of hair.
Yeah, yeah, the lock of hair.

578
00:55:57,575 --> 00:55:59,335
He defended Bean.
He said he was right.

579
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:02,570
Said the homesteaders spoiled this land
for the cattlemen. We all heard it.

580
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:04,275
I don‘t care what you heard.

581
00:56:04,348 --> 00:56:06,111
He couldn't be two-faced.
He's not that kind.

582
00:56:07,051 --> 00:56:09,212
If he took Bean's part,
he only did it to stop trouble.

583
00:56:10,221 --> 00:56:11,688
Miss Mathews,

584
00:56:13,191 --> 00:56:16,058
looks like every time I get into trouble,
you always speak up for me.

585
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:18,595
They‘re trying to tell me
you spoke up for Bean.

586
00:56:18,663 --> 00:56:22,929
Well, I did try to tell them
Bean's point of View.

587
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
There you are.

588
00:56:25,303 --> 00:56:27,464
It's always been my experience

589
00:56:27,538 --> 00:56:30,939
that when you know the other fellow‘s
point of view, you usually get together.

590
00:56:31,642 --> 00:56:34,110
Well, why didn't you tell him
our point of View?

591
00:56:34,178 --> 00:56:35,577
I did, and we got together.

592
00:56:36,948 --> 00:56:39,883
You won't have
to patrol your fields any longer.

593
00:56:39,951 --> 00:56:42,010
Judge gave me his word they'd round up
all cattle in this valley

594
00:56:42,086 --> 00:56:43,178
and take them out of here.

595
00:56:44,355 --> 00:56:46,550
You think he'd keep his word?

596
00:56:46,958 --> 00:56:49,654
Well, I'm going along with him
to see that he does.

597
00:56:49,727 --> 00:56:52,594
Well, what makes you think
we'd take your word?

598
00:56:54,999 --> 00:56:56,193
Take it or leave it.

599
00:56:58,236 --> 00:56:59,567
Harden,

600
00:57:01,105 --> 00:57:03,164
you‘re a sneak and a liar.

601
00:58:32,763 --> 00:58:34,162
Miss Mathews!

602
00:58:41,105 --> 00:58:42,105
I'll be back.

603
00:58:54,652 --> 00:58:56,483
California's that way.

604
00:58:59,023 --> 00:59:01,287
I got something to tell you before I go.

605
00:59:03,895 --> 00:59:06,193
Well?
How‘s Wade?

606
00:59:07,565 --> 00:59:10,033
He‘s fine, just fine.

607
00:59:14,005 --> 00:59:16,906
You know,
you‘re not the prettiest girl I ever saw.

608
00:59:19,343 --> 00:59:21,504
Well, that‘s great news. Who asked you?

609
00:59:22,179 --> 00:59:24,670
But you've got the prettiest hair
I ever saw.

610
00:59:27,451 --> 00:59:29,544
Why do you like to make fun of me?

611
00:59:31,923 --> 00:59:33,356
‘Cause I like you, I guess.

612
00:59:34,825 --> 00:59:40,058
And you think my hair's pretty?
I never saw anything like it.

613
00:59:50,041 --> 00:59:53,533
Oh, could I clip a lock?
No, you can't.

614
00:59:54,845 --> 00:59:57,177
Will you clip one?
No, I won't.

615
00:59:58,115 --> 01:00:01,107
Come around here, take sides with Bean,

616
01:00:02,219 --> 01:00:04,517
and knock out my best friend, and...

617
01:00:04,889 --> 01:00:06,356
Tell you how much I like you,

618
01:00:08,492 --> 01:00:12,121
and how much I might miss you?

619
01:00:33,417 --> 01:00:35,112
All right?
No.

620
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:47,995
Here, these are yours.

621
01:01:31,876 --> 01:01:34,811
Well, thanks a lot.

622
01:02:21,926 --> 01:02:22,926
Jane Ellen!

623
01:02:42,246 --> 01:02:43,907
Go on, Cole. Go on.

624
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:50,887
Well, so I says to her...
I said, "Miss Langtry",

625
01:02:51,689 --> 01:02:54,590
"do you plan to go back to England
when you finish your American tour?"

626
01:02:56,093 --> 01:02:59,085
And she said to me... She said,

627
01:03:00,931 --> 01:03:05,061
"No." Said she loved
the United States too much.

628
01:03:05,202 --> 01:03:06,726
Yeah?
She planned to stay here

629
01:03:06,804 --> 01:03:08,897
for the rest of her life.

630
01:03:10,641 --> 01:03:13,576
She told me that when she got
all through her work in the theater,

631
01:03:13,644 --> 01:03:16,340
that she wanted to settle down
someplace out here in the West.

632
01:03:17,348 --> 01:03:18,576
By gobs.

633
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:22,585
Some quiet little place
way out on the range,

634
01:03:22,653 --> 01:03:25,383
away from all the lights and the crowds.

635
01:03:28,459 --> 01:03:30,893
She kept asking about Texas especially.

636
01:03:34,532 --> 01:03:38,798
She says that ever since she was
a little girl, she'd heard about Texas,

637
01:03:40,304 --> 01:03:44,365
and it'd always been the dream of her life
to have a home here someday.

638
01:03:45,476 --> 01:03:48,036
She did?
She did.

639
01:03:57,087 --> 01:03:59,578
Last herd just come in, Judge.

640
01:04:18,976 --> 01:04:20,307
Well?

641
01:04:27,051 --> 01:04:28,051
Oh.

642
01:05:54,371 --> 01:05:55,371
By gobs!

643
01:06:02,012 --> 01:06:03,570
A lock of her own hair!

644
01:06:07,084 --> 01:06:08,608
It's kind of dark, ain‘t it?

645
01:06:13,357 --> 01:06:16,053
Yeah, she uses lots
of shampoo on her hair.

646
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:17,160
She does?

647
01:06:18,195 --> 01:06:20,755
It's beautiful. Beautiful.

648
01:06:23,133 --> 01:06:26,000
I'll never forget this, Cole. Never.

649
01:06:30,174 --> 01:06:32,506
Let me see it, will you?
What for?

650
01:06:33,577 --> 01:06:35,442
I ain‘t going to keep it.

651
01:06:36,313 --> 01:06:38,304
I'd like to see you try.

652
01:06:48,092 --> 01:06:51,858
All right?
All right.

653
01:07:00,504 --> 01:07:02,438
I know how you feel, son.

654
01:07:16,053 --> 01:07:17,680
Almighty God,

655
01:07:17,755 --> 01:07:21,953
we offer thee thanksgiving for thy help
and thy divine bounty.

656
01:07:22,793 --> 01:07:25,421
Thou has poured thy blessings on our land.

657
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:29,996
Thou hast visited
the Earth and made it plenteous.

658
01:07:30,134 --> 01:07:33,228
Thou hast made it soft with drops of rain,

659
01:07:33,404 --> 01:07:36,931
and the land that was desolate
has became like a garden,

660
01:07:37,708 --> 01:07:41,735
and the waste places are become fenced
and are inhabited.

661
01:07:41,979 --> 01:07:45,312
Thou hast made the tree of the field
yield he! Fruit,

662
01:07:45,382 --> 01:07:47,009
and the Earth, her increase.

663
01:07:47,885 --> 01:07:50,319
Thou hast broken the bonds of our yoke

664
01:07:50,387 --> 01:07:53,015
and delivered us out of the hands
of our enemies,

665
01:07:53,857 --> 01:07:58,760
so that we shall dwell here safely,
and none shall make us afraid,

666
01:07:58,896 --> 01:08:04,835
and for this, thy divine bounty,
Oh, Lord, we thank thee. Amen.

667
01:08:05,369 --> 01:08:06,666
Amen.
Amen .

668
01:08:35,566 --> 01:08:37,326
One foot up
and the other foot down

669
01:08:37,367 --> 01:08:39,927
Swing them pretty girls ‘round and ‘round

670
01:08:47,711 --> 01:08:50,202
Here it is.
What?

671
01:08:52,149 --> 01:08:53,741
Tell me something first.

672
01:08:55,152 --> 01:08:56,676
Where do you keep my lock of hair?

673
01:08:57,721 --> 01:08:59,052
Oh...

674
01:09:00,591 --> 01:09:01,591
Show me.

675
01:09:07,264 --> 01:09:09,858
Nobody can see that, not even you.

676
01:09:15,539 --> 01:09:19,407
Look, Cole, the best piece
of homestead land in the whole country.

677
01:09:21,979 --> 01:09:24,675
It used to belong to one
of the hired men that left us,

678
01:09:24,748 --> 01:09:27,273
and now it's anybody's. You just claim it.

679
01:09:29,019 --> 01:09:31,852
Yeah, that‘s a fine piece
of land all right.

680
01:09:31,989 --> 01:09:34,048
Yeah, look at the feed
on those slopes over there,

681
01:09:34,658 --> 01:09:37,991
and that strip along the bottom
is just fine for wheat or corn.

682
01:09:40,831 --> 01:09:43,459
And, Cole, look,
that little knoll right there,

683
01:09:45,168 --> 01:09:47,398
it's just begging for a house.

684
01:09:51,341 --> 01:09:55,368
Do you know how to build a house?
No, how?

685
01:09:58,549 --> 01:10:01,074
Well, you... You...

686
01:10:05,389 --> 01:10:07,949
Well, you have the kitchen there,

687
01:10:09,793 --> 01:10:13,126
and the bedroom over there,
and the living room right in the middle.

688
01:10:14,765 --> 01:10:17,734
It would have to have
the right things in it, too.

689
01:10:19,169 --> 01:10:20,363
What sort of things?

690
01:10:21,705 --> 01:10:27,666
Oh, fires and lamp lights, warm beds,

691
01:10:29,546 --> 01:10:33,141
the smell of coffee in the morning,
the sound of rain on the roof.

692
01:10:36,353 --> 01:10:39,550
Gee, that‘s a nice house, Jane Ellen.

693
01:10:56,607 --> 01:10:57,607
Jane!

694
01:11:14,791 --> 01:11:15,791
Look!

695
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:23,766
Go to your homes!
Protect your houses!

696
01:11:23,834 --> 01:11:25,426
Hey, Wade, grab another team,

697
01:11:25,502 --> 01:11:28,102
we‘ll take a section of rail fence
and knock down a strip of corn.

698
01:11:28,405 --> 01:11:30,339
Maybe we can start a backfire.

699
01:11:35,946 --> 01:11:37,811
Take the two end sections, Wade!

700
01:12:49,786 --> 01:12:53,313
Cole! Cole! Cole!

701
01:13:09,873 --> 01:13:11,738
Hey, get out of here! Move!

702
01:13:38,835 --> 01:13:40,234
Look, the house!

703
01:14:20,177 --> 01:14:25,479
Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Father!

704
01:14:29,553 --> 01:14:31,851
Help! Help!

705
01:14:35,058 --> 01:14:36,525
Come on, hurry up!

706
01:15:08,892 --> 01:15:11,656
Watch out for his leg and shoulder.
All right.

707
01:15:15,165 --> 01:15:16,189
Take it easy.

708
01:15:16,266 --> 01:15:18,359
Have you seen Jane Mathews?
No.

709
01:16:45,021 --> 01:16:48,548
Sol hereBy christen this town Langtry!

710
01:16:52,963 --> 01:16:57,024
No man ever gave a woman
a whole town afore, but I'm doing it,

711
01:16:57,334 --> 01:17:01,771
and from now on, this whole section's going
to bloom like the Jersey Lily herself!

712
01:17:05,041 --> 01:17:08,010
Quiet! I ain‘t through yet.

713
01:17:09,079 --> 01:17:12,446
Miss Langtry‘s coming soon
to play a night in Fort Davis,

714
01:17:12,515 --> 01:17:15,279
and I want every legal resident
of Langtry, Texas,

715
01:17:15,352 --> 01:17:18,412
to go over and see
the godmother of this here town,

716
01:17:18,488 --> 01:17:23,221
a town of cattlemen, for cattlemen,
and By gobs, run By cattlemen!

717
01:17:30,467 --> 01:17:34,904
Now, in honor of this great occasion,
I'm dishing out free beer to one and all,

718
01:17:34,971 --> 01:17:37,633
and anybody found sober after sundown

719
01:17:37,707 --> 01:17:41,199
is liable to arrest for disorderly conduct,
and that‘s my ruling!

720
01:17:43,780 --> 01:17:45,372
Start the music!

721
01:19:04,961 --> 01:19:08,158
"And man that is born
of woman has but a short time to live."

722
01:19:09,532 --> 01:19:12,501
"He cometh up
and is cut down like a flower."

723
01:19:13,770 --> 01:19:18,036
"He fleeth as if it were a shadow,
and never continueth in one stay."

724
01:19:21,444 --> 01:19:24,470
"In the midst of life, we are in death."

725
01:19:55,578 --> 01:19:59,708
The wagon train‘s left.
The people have all gone, Jane Ellen.

726
01:19:59,782 --> 01:20:04,446
I'm staying. Nobody‘s going to drive me
away from my land,

727
01:20:05,321 --> 01:20:09,018
not with cattle, or fire,
or killing my father, or anything else.

728
01:20:09,926 --> 01:20:13,384
I'll be here long after Bean and his gang
of murderers are gone.

729
01:20:15,298 --> 01:20:18,062
Sure you will, and me, too.

730
01:20:19,736 --> 01:20:20,736
I don‘t want you.

731
01:20:21,905 --> 01:20:24,635
I don't want
any of Roy Bean's friends around.

732
01:20:25,708 --> 01:20:29,610
Wade Harper was right.
I didn't believe it then, but I do now.

733
01:20:30,013 --> 01:20:32,140
You knew we were going to be burned out.

734
01:20:32,382 --> 01:20:33,679
That‘s why you herded all the cattle out,

735
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:36,116
so they wouldn't be burned
with our crops.

736
01:20:38,588 --> 01:20:43,150
No, I don‘t need your help. Not now.

737
01:20:44,861 --> 01:20:46,761
I can do what I have to do alone.

738
01:20:53,636 --> 01:20:55,103
I'll be back.

739
01:21:33,977 --> 01:21:35,569
Why. Cole!

740
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:38,571
By gobs, man, I'm glad to see you.

741
01:21:38,648 --> 01:21:40,968
Why, I never wanted to see
a man so much before in my life.

742
01:21:41,017 --> 01:21:42,416
What for?
What for?

743
01:21:42,485 --> 01:21:45,181
Don't you know what for?
She's coming to Fort Davis.

744
01:21:45,455 --> 01:21:48,288
Lily Langtry‘s coming to Fort Davis.
Langtry?

745
01:21:48,424 --> 01:21:50,551
Langtry, yeah, and you and me
are going over there together.

746
01:21:50,627 --> 01:21:53,425
You‘re going to introduce me to her.
By gobs, I'm going to meet her.

747
01:21:53,496 --> 01:21:55,361
I just can't believe it.
I want to talk to you, Judge.

748
01:21:55,431 --> 01:21:57,456
Yeah, all right. And look
what I got to tell her when I see her.

749
01:21:57,533 --> 01:22:01,435
Langtry, that‘s the name of this town,
a great town after a great woman.

750
01:22:01,771 --> 01:22:04,001
I said I wanted to talk to you, Judge.
Sure.

751
01:22:06,542 --> 01:22:07,634
Cole, it's a great day.

752
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:10,508
I tell you, it's the greatest day
in the history of Texas.

753
01:22:14,317 --> 01:22:16,979
Some fire?
Yeah, wasn't it, though?

754
01:22:17,053 --> 01:22:19,613
Yeah, too bad.
Yeah.

755
01:22:20,857 --> 01:22:21,857
Yep.

756
01:22:22,392 --> 01:22:25,384
I wonder who was behind it?
Oh, a fire don‘t need nothing behind it.

757
01:22:25,461 --> 01:22:28,259
Fire has a way of moving on its own.
Here‘s how.

758
01:22:31,105 --> 01:22:34,145
Before I drink with you, Judge, I want
to know you had nothing to do with it.

759
01:22:34,170 --> 01:22:36,638
Me? Why, how can you say
a thing like that?

760
01:22:36,703 --> 01:22:38,383
Didn’t I round up all them cattle for you?

761
01:22:38,408 --> 01:22:40,740
Wasn't I right here in the saloon
when the fire broke out?

762
01:22:40,810 --> 01:22:42,072
Didn’t...

763
01:22:44,447 --> 01:22:47,974
Well, I was, and what‘s more,
I ain‘t got no idea who done it.

764
01:22:49,552 --> 01:22:51,076
Now, drink up.

765
01:22:56,426 --> 01:22:58,394
Don‘t you believe me?
No.

766
01:23:01,631 --> 01:23:06,534
Now, listen, son, I told you how it was,
and I don‘t want you calling me no liar.

767
01:23:07,737 --> 01:23:09,364
Now, drink hearty.

768
01:23:13,042 --> 01:23:14,042
Will you swear By that?

769
01:23:15,645 --> 01:23:17,738
There ain‘t no reason I should,
but I'm willing.

770
01:23:18,247 --> 01:23:21,512
All right, I swear By my sword there
I had nothing to do with it.

771
01:23:21,918 --> 01:23:23,317
I swear By the revised statutes.

772
01:23:23,886 --> 01:23:26,081
By gobs, if there was a
Bible in town I'd...

773
01:23:26,189 --> 01:23:27,747
Where‘s that lock of hair?

774
01:23:29,359 --> 01:23:31,850
Right here with me.
Let me see it.

775
01:23:41,804 --> 01:23:42,804
Swear on that?

776
01:23:47,477 --> 01:23:49,809
All right, it was me.
I burned their houses and crops.

777
01:23:49,912 --> 01:23:52,472
I run them varmints out.
Nice going.

778
01:23:52,548 --> 01:23:53,548
And if you think...

779
01:23:56,252 --> 01:23:58,277
If you think I'm sorry, you‘re crazy.

780
01:23:58,354 --> 01:24:00,754
I'm proud and glad I rid
the country of them.

781
01:24:00,823 --> 01:24:04,350
It was either them or us,
and now the range grass will grow back,

782
01:24:04,427 --> 01:24:06,554
and some day,
the cattlemen will put up a statue of me

783
01:24:06,629 --> 01:24:08,597
out there on the street,
and they'll write on it,

784
01:24:08,664 --> 01:24:11,929
"Judge Roy Bean,
he give us back the land."

785
01:24:14,867 --> 01:24:16,547
You get warrants in Fort Davis, don‘t you?

786
01:24:16,572 --> 01:24:17,664
Yeah, that‘s where they get them,

787
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:18,968
but they don‘t know
how to spell my name.

788
01:24:19,041 --> 01:24:20,872
It's been tried before.
I'll get one.

789
01:24:22,145 --> 01:24:24,465
This time, you‘re going to get
what‘s coming to you, Judge.

790
01:24:27,383 --> 01:24:28,475
Cole!

791
01:24:29,419 --> 01:24:33,048
You and me‘s friends. I done what I had to,
and you think it was wrong.

792
01:24:33,122 --> 01:24:35,647
But if it was my own son come
over here with a warrant,

793
01:24:36,125 --> 01:24:37,922
he'd have to be first on the draw.

794
01:24:38,628 --> 01:24:43,031
I aim to be, unless I get it in the back
before I get out of here.

795
01:25:25,842 --> 01:25:27,139
So long, Cole.

796
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:40,519
Make out a warrant against Roy Bean.

797
01:25:43,125 --> 01:25:44,717
Raise your right hand.

798
01:25:44,891 --> 01:25:47,371
Do you solemnly swear
to carry out the duties of deputy sheriff

799
01:25:47,396 --> 01:25:49,125
in Jeff Davis County
in the state of Texas?

800
01:25:49,198 --> 01:25:50,198
Yep.

801
01:25:55,471 --> 01:25:56,471
Thanks, Sheriff.

802
01:26:20,062 --> 01:26:21,495
How much are tickets?

803
01:26:21,564 --> 01:26:24,362
$2 apiece, all over the house.
First come, first served.

804
01:26:24,834 --> 01:26:27,359
How many seats in the house?
Four hundred.

805
01:26:27,436 --> 01:26:29,336
I'll take them.
How many?

806
01:26:29,438 --> 01:26:30,803
All of them.

807
01:26:43,719 --> 01:26:44,719
Much obliged.

808
01:26:46,155 --> 01:26:47,554
Let me have two tickets.

809
01:26:57,199 --> 01:27:00,430
If I was you, Judge, I wouldn't set foot
in Fort Davis to see Adam and Eve.

810
01:27:00,503 --> 01:27:01,503
Me, either.

811
01:27:01,571 --> 01:27:04,369
A deputy‘s star makes
the finest kind of a target.

812
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:07,707
How you know you‘re
not heading into a trap?

813
01:27:07,777 --> 01:27:09,836
Sure looking for trouble,
going over to Fort Davis.

814
01:27:09,912 --> 01:27:10,901
Taking an awful chance, Judge.

815
01:27:11,013 --> 01:27:13,243
Them hombres
just waiting down there for you.

816
01:27:13,316 --> 01:27:16,752
Why, you pack of yellow bellies,
give me them tickets.

817
01:27:24,527 --> 01:27:26,207
You mean,
you‘re going to Fort Davis alone?

818
01:27:26,262 --> 01:27:27,923
Not By a jugful, I ain‘t.

819
01:27:27,997 --> 01:27:29,897
You‘re all going with me
as a guard of honor,

820
01:27:29,999 --> 01:27:33,230
right up to the opera house,
but I'm going in alone.

821
01:27:33,302 --> 01:27:35,998
I don‘t want nobody in there
with me no how.

822
01:27:36,072 --> 01:27:38,973
I ain‘t sharing the
Jersey Lily with no one.

823
01:27:39,375 --> 01:27:41,240
Now, come on,
we got a day's ride ahead of us.

824
01:27:41,310 --> 01:27:43,801
I'm going to dress,
and you fellows proud yourselves up a bit.

825
01:27:43,879 --> 01:27:45,744
Chickenfoot, my sword.

826
01:28:08,804 --> 01:28:11,500
I ain‘t wore this uniform
since Chickamauga,

827
01:28:11,741 --> 01:28:13,504
but it still fits right smart.

828
01:28:19,849 --> 01:28:22,750
Bean and his men are coming!
Get off the street!

829
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:26,347
Bean and his men are coming!

830
01:28:34,797 --> 01:28:37,493
Bean's coming! Bean's coming!

831
01:28:53,816 --> 01:28:54,816
Hey, look!

832
01:28:57,420 --> 01:28:58,781
They must have heard I was coming.

833
01:29:13,536 --> 01:29:15,401
All right, boys, take your places.

834
01:29:24,847 --> 01:29:26,280
Hey, this is the stage entrance.

835
01:29:30,286 --> 01:29:32,686
Now, remember,
I want strict privacy all during the show.

836
01:29:32,922 --> 01:29:34,412
You'll get it.

837
01:29:51,373 --> 01:29:52,373
Third seat in.

838
01:30:12,061 --> 01:30:14,073
Pardon, sir, your
seat is back here.

839
01:30:14,099 --> 01:30:15,783
No, it ain‘t. It's right here.

840
01:31:01,510 --> 01:31:04,604
Say, when does Miss Langtry
go on the play?

841
01:31:05,014 --> 01:31:07,505
Right after the curtain.
She's about to go up now, sir.

842
01:31:07,583 --> 01:31:09,744
Go up?
The curtain, sir.

843
01:31:25,768 --> 01:31:26,928
Now?

844
01:31:28,237 --> 01:31:29,932
Yes, now.

845
01:31:33,609 --> 01:31:34,769
Now.

846
01:32:01,036 --> 01:32:04,403
Don‘t make a move, Judge.
I'm coming down to get you.

847
01:32:05,808 --> 01:32:06,808
Come shooting.

848
01:32:41,710 --> 01:32:42,972
The war‘s on.
Yeah.

849
01:32:43,045 --> 01:32:45,104
Wish I was in there to see that show.

850
01:32:45,381 --> 01:32:48,145
I bet the judge is having a good time.
Yeah.

851
01:34:08,630 --> 01:34:09,630
Hey!

852
01:34:11,233 --> 01:34:13,463
Let‘s you and me stand up
and shoot it out.

853
01:34:15,537 --> 01:34:17,334
That suits me, Judge.

854
01:34:19,208 --> 01:34:21,335
Put up your gun. We‘ll draw.

855
01:34:22,177 --> 01:34:23,177
All right.

856
01:34:29,418 --> 01:34:31,147
Ready?
Yeah.

857
01:35:06,255 --> 01:35:08,189
Now, you see what you done?

858
01:35:09,558 --> 01:35:10,558
You stopped the show.

859
01:35:11,794 --> 01:35:13,819
I was going to see Lily.

860
01:35:18,534 --> 01:35:20,627
Now it's too late.

861
01:35:21,336 --> 01:35:23,031
No, it isn't, Judge.

862
01:35:23,872 --> 01:35:26,340
She's back there now, waiting to see you.

863
01:35:29,445 --> 01:35:30,537
What?

864
01:35:31,647 --> 01:35:34,844
She knows all about you, Judge.
She wants to meet you.

865
01:35:34,917 --> 01:35:36,885
She told me so herself.

866
01:35:39,555 --> 01:35:42,080
Come on, let‘s go back and see her.

867
01:35:48,797 --> 01:35:49,991
My hat.

868
01:36:18,694 --> 01:36:19,694
Where‘s Miss Langtry?

869
01:36:21,230 --> 01:36:23,198
Put me down. I can walk.

870
01:36:24,399 --> 01:36:27,232
Put me down, I tell you. That‘s my ruling.

871
01:37:15,384 --> 01:37:20,014
Miss Langtry, I'd like to present
an old admirer. Judge Roy Bean.

872
01:37:26,295 --> 01:37:29,093
I'm pleased to meet you.

873
01:38:32,628 --> 01:38:35,392
Cole, come here quick!

874
01:38:40,135 --> 01:38:41,135
Look!

875
01:38:46,141 --> 01:38:48,234
See, what did I tell you?
They‘re coming back.

876
01:38:49,411 --> 01:38:50,935
Wagons By the score.

877
01:38:52,447 --> 01:38:53,880
It's the promised land.

878
01:38:54,883 --> 01:38:55,883
Jane Ellen,

879
01:38:57,452 --> 01:39:01,013
someday, Texas is going to be
the biggest and the finest...
