put it up there last night.

you've been tried and found guilty

of the most serious crime
west of the Pecos,

Got anything to say for yourself before
the sentence of the court is executed?

11

I told you they shot at me first!

I didn't mean to kill that steer on purpose!
I was aiming at the man.

Glad to join you.
Have you ever met Miss Langtry?

27

No, I never met her. I never met the sun,
I never shook hands with the moon,

28
00:05:06,034 --> 00:05:09,034
and I've never been introduced
to no clouds.

29

That's all right. Too bad Lily Langtry
couldn't have heard that.

30

No, I was in England once,
but didn't get around to it.

Oh, you was in England once,

- but you never got around to it, eh?
- Yeah.

Well, so it is. Pete.

when some of your wranglers came up
and took him away.

62
00:08:59,354 --> 00:09:04,452
Oh, yeah, he was hanging around out there
a while back, but he ain't around now.

63
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,552
Your men not only took him away,
but they tore down the fence.

64
00:09:07,652 --> 00:09:10,450
Not a stick of it was left standing.
JUDGE BEAN: That so?

65
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,450
Yes, that's so, and you needn't pretend
you don't know about it.

66
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:17,548
Well, it don't surprise me none.
It's against the law

67
00:09:17,648 --> 00:09:20,146
- What law? Whose law?
- Mine.

68
00:09:20,246 --> 00:09:23,146
- Now, you listen to me, Mr. Bean.
- Judge Bean.

69
00:09:23,246 --> 00:09:27,044
You're no more a judge than I am.
Just call yourself a judge.

70
00:09:27,144 --> 00:09:30,644
I wouldn't say that if I was you.
I might consider it contempt of court.

71
00:09:30,744 --> 00:09:33,942
It's contempt, all right.
You call this a court?

72
00:09:34,242 --> 00:09:39,640
I do, and it happens to be
in session right now.

73
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,138
Now, you sit down, Miss Mathews,
and I'll tend to your case in a minute.

74
00:09:44,738 --> 00:09:49,036
You're charged with stealing a horse.
Guilty or not guilty?

75
00:09:49,136 --> 00:09:51,136
- JUDGE BEAN: Where's exhibit A?
- Huh?

76
00:09:51,236 --> 00:09:55,534
Where's the horse?
Bring in the horse, Chickenfoot.

77
00:09:55,934 --> 00:09:59,734
Miss Mathews, when cattle can't get
to water, they die.

78
00:09:59,734 --> 00:10:01,632
There's miles of river on each side
of our homestead.

It always was, and always will be.

CHICKENFOOT: Get in there. All right,
give me room there, you guys.

81
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,128
Whoa, Pete. Come on in here.

82
00:10:13,828 --> 00:10:18,726
Come on, get over there.
Give us a little room.

83
00:10:19,626 --> 00:10:22,026
Mr. Harden, it's my duty to inform you

84
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:26,524
that the larceny of an equine
is a capital offense, punishable by death,

85
00:10:27,124 --> 00:10:28,824
but you can rest assured that,
in this court,

86
00:10:28,924 --> 00:10:32,522
a horse thief always gets a fair trial
before he's hung.

87
00:10:33,922 --> 00:10:37,320
- Chickenfoot, that's your horse?
- Oh, why, Judge...

88
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,820
Can you prove it's your horse?

89
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:43,718
Why, Judge, anybody here... I can prove
it by Pete himself that he's my horse.

90
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:47,016
Pete, you're my horse, ain't you?

91
00:10:47,716 --> 00:10:53,114
Ownership of horse clearly established.
It belongs to Chickenfoot.

92
00:10:53,714 --> 00:10:55,914
Well, I don't contest it, Your Honor.
Maybe the horse does belong

93
00:10:56,014 --> 00:10:58,912
to Chickenfoot here, but I didn't steal it.

94
00:10:59,012 --> 00:11:01,812
- How'd you get it then?
- I bought it.

95
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:06,910
JUDGE BEAN: Order in the court!
- That all you got to say?

96
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,710
No, it's not. I'm not going to stay here
and see anybody railroaded like this.

97
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:12,708
Miss Mathews, I don't recollect you was
summoned as a witness in this trial.

98
00:11:12,808 --> 00:11:14,308
What kind of a trial is it when a prisoner

99
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:16,006
isn't even allowed to have anybody
speak for him?

100
00:11:16,106 --> 00:11:17,106
You an attorney, Miss?

101
00:11:17,206 --> 00:11:19,206
I'm as much an attorney
as you are a judge.

102
00:11:19,306 --> 00:11:20,606
- You know this man?
- No, I don't.

103
00:11:20,706 --> 00:11:21,904
- You ever see him before?
- No, but...

104
00:11:22,004 --> 00:11:23,604
- Can you prove he didn't steal the horse?
- No.

105
00:11:23,704 --> 00:11:26,404
Then he don't need no lawyer then.
This man was caught on a stolen horse,

106
00:11:26,404 --> 00:11:28,202
and in this jurisdiction,
that's prima facie evidence.

107
00:11:28,302 --> 00:11:33,400
- The case is closed and that's my ruling.
- Yes, and it's just like all your rulings!

108
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,700
The courtroom will now be cleared
of everybody,

109
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,798
excepting the judge, the jury, the prisoner,
the witnesses and...

110
00:11:42,898 --> 00:11:47,196
I guess that means you.
All right, I'll go.

111
00:11:47,896 --> 00:11:52,494
It's murder, that's what it is. Murder.
This man hasn't got a chance,

112
00:11:52,594 --> 00:11:54,294
but you never give anybody a chance.

113
00:11:54,394 --> 00:11:57,592
You didn't give us one when you
stampeded the cattle over our crops.

114
00:11:57,692 --> 00:12:00,392
You thought you'd starve
the homesteaders out, but you didn't.

115
00:12:00,492 --> 00:12:03,690
You can pester us and rob us and kill us,
but you can't stop us.

116
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,290
'Cause there'll always be more coming.
More and more.

117
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:11,288
And we'll stay on our farms in spite of you,
and your courtroom and your killers!

118
00:12:12,288 --> 00:12:15,286
By gobs, she's all right.
She'd make a good cattleman.

119
00:12:15,286 --> 00:12:17,886
If it wasn't for Lily, I'd marry her.

120
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:39,178
Giddap.

121
00:12:39,478 --> 00:12:41,978
You heard the case against the accused,
pro and con.

122
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:45,876
Now I guess maybe you'd better retire
to consider a verdict.

123
00:12:46,576 --> 00:12:49,074
(HORSE HOOVES CLOPPING)

124
00:12:49,174 --> 00:12:51,474
Chickenfoot, you'd better take
Pete out for a little fresh air.

125
00:12:51,574 --> 00:12:54,174
Take him out, Bart. I got work to do.

126
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:05,170
And while you retire,
there'll be a recess for them that's thirsty.

127
00:13:10,768 --> 00:13:13,566
Well, I guess you can't take it with you.

128
00:13:15,066 --> 00:13:16,466
It's got to be strictly understood

129
00:13:16,566 --> 00:13:19,964
you ain't making no effort to influence
the sober judgment of the jury.

130
00:13:20,064 --> 00:13:22,664
- Certainly not.
- There you are.

131
00:13:23,164 --> 00:13:26,562
- Compliments of the prisoner.
- Jury to the rear!

132
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,160
Bull's-eye.

133
00:13:40,856 --> 00:13:43,856
- Join me, Your Honor?
- Don't mind if I do.

134
00:13:45,956 --> 00:13:49,954
Don't spill none of that liquor, son.
It eats right into the bar.

135
00:14:07,248 --> 00:14:10,646
To the unfortunate lady
with the bullet in her face.

136
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:16,544
The man that fired that bullet
was hauled out of here feet first.

137
00:14:16,644 --> 00:14:19,644
Any man that'd shoot at a picture
of Lily Langtry ought to be killed.

138
00:14:19,744 --> 00:14:24,342
It's just retribution.
It's justifiable homicide,

139
00:14:24,442 --> 00:14:25,642
Right.

140
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,940
You an admirer of Miss Lily's, too?

141
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,838
Well, that's putting it mildly.

142
00:14:38,338 --> 00:14:41,236
She's the most beautiful woman
I ever met.

143
00:14:42,636 --> 00:14:43,736
Met?

144
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:51,032
You mean to tell me you met Lily Langtry,
the real her, in the flesh?

145
00:14:52,532 --> 00:14:54,132
What an actress.

146
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,030
How'd you get to know her?

147
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,328
Well, that's a long story, Judge.

148
00:15:05,528 --> 00:15:08,826
Bart, you and Blackjack
get yourself a drink, huh?

149
00:15:11,226 --> 00:15:16,724
Mighty fine liquor. What do you call it?
- Rub of the brush. Go on.

150
00:15:16,824 --> 00:15:20,522
- Did you get to know her real well?
- It's got character.

151
00:15:24,422 --> 00:15:27,320
I said, did you get to know her real well?

152
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,418
Now, Judge, you forget a gentleman
never discusses a lady in a barroom.

153
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:37,516
Who said it's a barroom?
This is a courtroom.

154
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:42,616
Say, tell me,
is she as pretty as them pictures?

155
00:15:44,414 --> 00:15:48,414
Why, the picture's never been made
that can do justice to Lily Langtry.

156
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,212
Is she good-natured?

157
00:15:52,912 --> 00:15:54,311
An angel.

158
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:02,308
- I'll never forget the night we met.
- Yeah?

159
00:16:05,508 --> 00:16:08,206
I'll never forget it as long as I live.

160
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,198
Who was that?
Oh, that's Mort Borrow.

161
00:16:33,698 --> 00:16:35,296
Go on about Lily.

162
00:16:39,396 --> 00:16:40,894
Oh, yeah, Lily.

163
00:16:48,192 --> 00:16:52,690
How about a verdict?
Can't you see

164
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:58,190
SOUTHEAST: Two aces.
COWBOY 1: Bet a dollar and a half.

165
00:16:59,088 --> 00:17:03,588
Get away from here.
You smell of formaldehyde!

166
00:17:04,386 --> 00:17:07,386
You been down around Lanno Bay,
ain't you?

167
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:10,384
Well, you know how it is at sunset.

168
00:17:11,484 --> 00:17:16,282
You can look out and that water ain't
exactly blue, and it ain't exactly purple.

169
00:17:16,982 --> 00:17:20,982
It's a kind of color a man can feel,
but he can't put a name to.

170
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:22,180
Yeah.

171
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,280
Well, that's Lily's eyes.

172
00:17:28,678 --> 00:17:29,978
By gobs!

173
00:17:36,976 --> 00:17:40,474
COWBOY 1: I'm out.
COWBOY 2: I'll stay out. Here we go.

174
00:17:40,474 --> 00:17:42,974
COWBOY 3: Got 10. Got a nine.

175
00:17:43,074 --> 00:17:47,872
You know how bright
and coppery and gold-like

176
00:17:47,972 --> 00:17:50,870
a young chestnut horse
is running in the bright sun?

177
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,970
- Yeah.
- Well, her hair is something like that.

178
00:17:57,668 --> 00:17:59,168
In the daytime.

179
00:18:00,468 --> 00:18:05,366
You mean it's different at night?
Well, not different,

180
00:18:05,866 --> 00:18:08,664
- How so?
- Well...

181
00:18:09,864 --> 00:18:14,862
Well, you know how it is at dusk when
you see a prairie fire reflected in the sky.

182
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:21,460
A sort of a deep...
A beautiful kind of blushing...

183
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,560
- Red?
- Red.

184
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:29,758
- Well, that'll give you a rough idea.
- By gobs.

185
00:18:34,956 --> 00:18:37,056
I got a lock of her hair.

186
00:18:38,854 --> 00:18:40,654
(JUDGE BEAN STUTTERS)

187
00:18:40,654 --> 00:18:44,552
You mean to tell me you actually got
the real... From her head?

188
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,150
I don't suppose you'd ever part
with that lock of hair,

189
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,048
no matter what a man was willing to give?

190
00:18:57,648 --> 00:19:00,146
A man don't trade things like that.

191
00:19:04,046 --> 00:19:06,244
You see that sword up there?

192
00:19:06,744 --> 00:19:10,444
I wore it in the civil war.
Always meant to be buried with it.

193
00:19:10,444 --> 00:19:13,142
Now, if you was willing to swap, why...

194
00:19:14,742 --> 00:19:16,542
Would you really like to have it?

195
00:19:16,642 --> 00:19:20,740
I'd rather own it than the state of Texas.
Let's have a look at it.

196
00:19:23,438 --> 00:19:25,438
I haven't got it with me.

197
00:19:28,738 --> 00:19:30,236
Where's it at?

198
00:19:31,536 --> 00:19:33,836
It's with my stuff in El Paso.

199
00:19:33,836 --> 00:19:37,134
So, you was in the civil war, huh, Judge?

200
00:19:37,234 --> 00:19:39,234
- El Paso, huh?
- Yeah.

201
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:44,032
- Cavalry, huh?
- I suppose you could write for it.

202
00:19:46,632 --> 00:19:47,930
Yeah.

203
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,030
Wouldn't take long to get here
by mail coach.

204
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,128
Oh, two, three weeks.

205
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:58,126
- Two or three weeks, huh?
- Yeah, about.

206
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:20,520
But I wouldn't part with that lock of hair
for anything in the world.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,614
JUDGE BEAN: That bottle of whiskey
gone already?

210
00:20:33,714 --> 00:20:37,814
Yeah, and if he ain't paid for it,
you better start collecting now.

211
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:54,008
- What's the verdict?
- You know what the verdict is. Guilty.

212
00:20:59,806 --> 00:21:02,204
There's only one thing I can do.

213
00:21:02,204 --> 00:21:06,404
You're sentenced to hang,
that's my ruling.

214
00:21:06,404 --> 00:21:10,202
- But, Judge, you just ruled...
- I didn't finish my ruling.

215
00:21:12,402 --> 00:21:15,200
The court sentenced the prisoner to hang,

216
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,900
but the court didn't say when.
So long as there's reasonable doubt...

217
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,398
What reasonable doubt, Judge?
We just caught him

218
00:21:22,498 --> 00:21:25,098
- Ain't any room for doubt.
- Order!

219
00:21:27,096 --> 00:21:31,094
I been talking to the prisoner.
He's a friend of Lily Langtry's.

220
00:21:32,194 --> 00:21:36,394
Stands to reason no friend of Lily Langtry
goes around stealing horses.

221
00:21:36,394 --> 00:21:40,392
Leastways, there's a reasonable doubt.
You mean,

222
00:21:40,492 --> 00:21:43,490
That ain't what I said.
When I make a ruling, it stands.

223
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:47,090
But, Judge, you just sentenced the man.
His sentence is suspended

224
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:51,488
for a couple weeks
until I can look into the matter further.

225
00:22:06,182 --> 00:22:09,482
- Hi, Mort. How's business?
- Just lost a customer.

226
00:22:09,682 --> 00:22:13,280
Well, I'll be down for a shave in a minute.
All right, you're next.

227
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,976
- Howdy, Judge.
- Hello, Evans.

228
00:22:25,976 --> 00:22:27,776
Jersey Lily special.

229
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:45,470
Pardon me, you don't happen
to have a twin brother, do you?

230
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,068
No, not me.

231
00:22:48,168 --> 00:22:51,368
Well, you'd better pay me that money
you owe me:

232
00:22:51,468 --> 00:22:55,866
You're loco, brother.
I don't owe you nothing.

233
00:23:01,164 --> 00:23:02,264
$60.

234
00:23:56,944 --> 00:24:00,044
If you're interested, that's the man
that sold me the roan horse.

235
00:24:00,144 --> 00:24:02,542
Then, he's the man that stole...

236
00:24:43,928 --> 00:24:46,328
$84 and 6 bits.

237
00:24:55,024 --> 00:25:00,122
Fined $80 for disorderly conduct,
and $4 and 6 bits

238
00:25:01,122 --> 00:25:06,020
Now, you men get some rope
and string him up.

239
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:09,520
We hang horse thieves, don't we?
String him up!

240
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,218
Come inside, son.

241
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,516
You can have his horse and outfit.

242
00:25:28,214 --> 00:25:30,912
- Rub of the brush?
- Rub of the brush.

00:37:07,072 --> 00:37:09,972
If you'd shoot back,
maybe they'd stop bothering you.

299
00:37:10,072 --> 00:37:13,270
And so did Shad Wilkins,
and he ain't trying it no more.

300
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,270
What about your own quarter section?

301
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:17,870
- Lf you leave, you'll lose it.
- We don't want no part of it.

302
00:37:17,968 --> 00:37:19,668
All right, Hod. If you feel that way,

303
00:37:19,668 --> 00:37:23,467
we'll try to get along
with just Eph and Henry.

304
00:37:25,566 --> 00:37:29,665
Henry, if we only had one man,
it'd be a big help.

305
00:37:29,764 --> 00:37:31,464
Sorry, Mr. Mathews.

306
00:37:40,562 --> 00:37:42,960
JANE ELLEN: Call themselves men.

307
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:52,556
Wade, what do we do?

308
00:37:57,556 --> 00:38:02,154
- I know what to do.
- No, no, wait. That's not the way.

309
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:04,053
Don't even think of it.

310
00:38:05,852 --> 00:38:08,752
Wade, aren't you going to stay for supper?

311
00:38:09,252 --> 00:38:10,650
I'll be back.

312
00:38:25,246 --> 00:38:26,845
Well, they left.

313
00:38:26,845 --> 00:38:28,744
Of course they have. What did you expect?

314
00:38:28,844 --> 00:38:30,644
My hands quit, too.
You can't blame them for leaving.

315
00:38:30,744 --> 00:38:32,744
There won't be a hired man left
in this part of the country

316
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:36,642
if we don't do something about it.
We hire new hands,

317
00:38:36,742 --> 00:38:41,640
What's old Mathews going to say about it?
He keeps passing the buck

318
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,640
I say, let's do something
about it ourselves.

319
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,538
- That's right.
- That's what I like to hear.

320
00:38:45,638 --> 00:38:48,038
Let's give the judge the same thing
he gave Shad Wilkins.

321
00:38:48,538 --> 00:38:52,536
Maybe if some of us went down
and appealed to Roy Bean for justice...

322
00:38:52,636 --> 00:38:56,835
Justice. If you'd seen him yesterday,
pretending to try that prisoner...

323
00:38:56,835 --> 00:39:01,634
The man didn't have a chance.
- I wonder if they hanged him.

324
00:39:01,734 --> 00:39:07,332
He was the same as dead
even while he stood there.

325
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:12,830
(EX CLAIMS)

326
00:39:15,528 --> 00:39:20,426
What is it, Daughter?
The man I told you about,

327
00:39:20,526 --> 00:39:23,626
I saw him plain as day,
looking in the window.

328
00:39:27,424 --> 00:39:32,822
You're seeing things, Jane Ellen.
There's nobody out there.

329
00:39:34,822 --> 00:39:36,521
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

330
00:39:37,222 --> 00:39:38,820
Come in.

331
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,220
Good evening.

332
00:39:50,916 --> 00:39:52,716
Pardon me for intruding like this.

333
00:39:52,816 --> 00:39:58,314
(STAMMERING) Oh, no, you're not.
It's just... Well, I thought you were a ghost.

334
00:40:00,012 --> 00:40:02,812
Well, I guess
you're partly to blame I'm not.

335
00:40:02,912 --> 00:40:06,812
- I just stopped in to thank you.
- Father, this is Mister...

336
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:10,410
- Harden.
- Welcome, Mr. Harden, welcome.

337
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:12,408
Glad to meet you.

338
00:40:14,508 --> 00:40:17,708
Oh, Mr. Harden,
this is our neighbor Wade Harper.

339
00:40:17,906 --> 00:40:20,306
This is the man I told you about.

340
00:40:20,306 --> 00:40:23,206
You mean to tell me Bean tried you,
and let you go?

341
00:40:23,206 --> 00:40:26,204
Well, she was my lawyer.
I guess she's the one that got me off.

342
00:40:26,204 --> 00:40:29,204
- I knew you weren't a horse thief.
- Thanks.

343
00:40:29,902 --> 00:40:31,802
How did you know that?

344
00:40:33,402 --> 00:40:34,902
I just knew.

345
00:40:35,402 --> 00:40:37,400
Are you working anywhere?

346
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,298
No, I'm heading for California.

347
00:40:42,998 --> 00:40:48,596
Mr. Harden, I suppose a body that's just
been hanged is apt to be a bit hungry.

348
00:40:48,596 --> 00:40:50,596
You must stay for supper.

349
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:57,594
- Well, I don't want to put you out any.
- Oh, no, not at all.

350
00:40:57,694 --> 00:41:00,692
Matter of fact, we had some company
that just disappointed us.

351
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:04,190
Uh-huh. We were hoping somebody'd
show up to take their place.

352
00:41:04,291 --> 00:41:07,590
Make yourself at home, now.
Make yourself at home.

353
00:41:12,388 --> 00:41:16,187
Wait till you sink your teeth
into some of Jane Ellen's stew.

354
00:41:24,284 --> 00:41:29,482
CALIPHET: Oh, Lord, for that which thou
hast sent us in our hour of need,

355
00:41:29,782 --> 00:41:31,682
make us truly grateful.

356
00:41:32,882 --> 00:41:37,680
Bless this food to our use and ourselves
to thy service. Amen.

357
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,178
Let me help you.

358
00:41:42,678 --> 00:41:43,778
How about some hominy?

359
00:41:43,778 --> 00:41:47,276
- Here, Wade. Give him some milk.
- All right, all right.

360
00:41:48,976 --> 00:41:52,274
I think he likes it here. I think we got him.

361
00:41:52,374 --> 00:41:54,774
- What's he doing now?
- Feeding his horse.

362
00:41:54,874 --> 00:41:59,572
Wade, he could probably take the place
of two men. He's so big and strong.

363
00:41:59,672 --> 00:42:03,071
- Well, I don't know how strong he is.
- Strong enough, Wade.

364
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:05,770
Now, Jane Ellen,
we'll leave you alone with him,

365
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:08,068
and you kind of add on
a little more welcome.

366
00:42:08,168 --> 00:42:10,768
- What'll I say?
- Oh, just keep smiling at him.

367
00:42:10,868 --> 00:42:15,566
And, Daughter,
if it should come up natural-like,

368
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:18,966
you might hint
what a handsome man he is.

369
00:42:19,564 --> 00:42:20,764
Handsome?

370
00:42:20,864 --> 00:42:25,062
We need him terribly bad, Daughter.
We got to get that corn husked.

371
00:42:25,164 --> 00:42:27,162
We need him terribly bad.

372
00:42:27,162 --> 00:42:30,862
- Listen, your father don't mean for you to...
- Shh.

373
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,658
Everything all right, Mr. Harden?
- Fine, thanks.

374
00:42:37,758 --> 00:42:41,358
- Oh, don't trouble.
- No trouble at all. Come on, Wade.

375
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:55,952
- Can I give you a hand?
- Oh, no, thanks.

376
00:42:56,652 --> 00:43:00,450
- Won't you sit down, please?
- Well, I won't argue with you.

377
00:43:01,051 --> 00:43:03,950
If I had to wash dishes,
I guess I'd give up eating.

378
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:08,948
Well, what do you do
about the dishes when you're home?

379
00:43:09,248 --> 00:43:11,148
Well, you live in a house, don't you?

380
00:43:11,348 --> 00:43:16,746
No. No, my house is all out there,
all one room with a sky for a roof.

381
00:43:17,946 --> 00:43:21,744
- Well, it's a big place.
- Got some space to rent.

382
00:43:23,744 --> 00:43:26,842
Well, I guess California's
your next stop, huh?

383
00:43:26,942 --> 00:43:32,240
California, but I don't stop.
Oregon next, I guess.

384
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:35,538
Well, all places aren't just the same.

385
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:39,338
Wouldn't you rather stay
a little longer in some places?

386
00:43:39,338 --> 00:43:42,036
No, they're all the same,
beautiful when you leave them.

387
00:43:42,436 --> 00:43:45,736
Well, it's like the turtles.
Carry their houses with them.

388
00:43:45,836 --> 00:43:48,234
If I had to build me a house,
I'd have it on wheels.

389
00:43:48,734 --> 00:43:53,232
Not me. I'd want my house
so that nothing could ever move it.

390
00:43:53,732 --> 00:43:57,032
So down deep
that an earthquake couldn't shake it,

391
00:43:57,332 --> 00:44:00,630
and a cyclone would be
just another wind going by.

392
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:06,628
Well, you say, "Who wants to be a turtle?"

393
00:44:07,428 --> 00:44:11,226
And I say, "I hope you'll be
very happy in your house."

394
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:24,822
- Well...
- Oh, say, wait a minute.

395
00:44:24,922 --> 00:44:26,222
What?

396
00:44:26,322 --> 00:44:29,820
I'll bet I know something
we could agree on.

397
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,519
Well, in about a week now,
we're going to husk the corn,

398
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:36,718
and I'll bet you'll agree that that's fun.
(EX CLAIMS QUESTIONINGLY)

399
00:44:36,718 --> 00:44:39,916
Well, you know, I think husking
corn's the greatest fun in the world.

400
00:44:40,716 --> 00:44:43,316
- Husking corn, fun?
- Oh, yes!

401
00:44:44,716 --> 00:44:48,414
- Well, I'd rather wash dishes.
- Oh, no.

402
00:44:50,414 --> 00:44:54,712
It was a fine supper, and good cooking.

403
00:44:58,010 --> 00:44:59,610
Oh, Mr. Harden.

404
00:45:06,708 --> 00:45:09,006
What a handsome man you are.

405
00:45:13,306 --> 00:45:14,406
(SIGHS)

406
00:45:14,706 --> 00:45:20,104
I doubt that, but I'm a tired one.
Well, I hope I see you

407
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,600
Get out of here! Hey!

408
00:45:40,896 --> 00:45:45,894
If anybody'd told me yesterday
I'd be playing tag in a cornfield

409
00:45:46,294 --> 00:45:51,492
If we had some men that would ride fence,
there wouldn't be any cows

410
00:45:54,092 --> 00:45:56,390
You were sure cute last night.

411
00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:02,788
Now you're making fun of me.
Well, that's...

412
00:46:09,086 --> 00:46:12,084
Hey, look at your father.
I wonder what's up.

413
00:46:19,682 --> 00:46:23,382
I tried to stop them.
They wouldn't listen to me.

414
00:46:23,382 --> 00:46:25,980
Yes, yes.
It's the wrong and lawless thing to do.

415
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:29,779
- I begged them not to. I told them.
- Who? What happened?

416
00:46:29,779 --> 00:46:34,378
Wade Harper has rounded up
some of the men.

417
00:46:34,477 --> 00:46:37,676
- When did they leave?
- About an hour ago.

418
00:47:35,056 --> 00:47:37,456
Thunder and lightning!
You back from California already?

419
00:47:37,556 --> 00:47:39,354
You got to get out of here,
and don't stop for nothing.

420
00:47:39,454 --> 00:47:40,454
Did you write to El Paso?

421
00:47:40,554 --> 00:47:42,854
Listen, just get on your horse and get,
because they're after you.

422
00:47:42,854 --> 00:47:45,452
Did you write? Who's after me?

423
00:47:45,652 --> 00:47:50,152
The homesteaders.
They're going to string you up.

424
00:47:50,152 --> 00:47:52,650
They're outside right now,
a whole wagonload of them.

425
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:56,150
A wagonload?
Why, I can handle a train load of them.

426
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:58,448
I'll tear their livers out.

427
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:26,938
What'll it be, gentlemen?
It'll be Roy Bean. Where is he?

428
00:48:28,638 --> 00:48:30,437
He's out for a while.

429
00:48:31,737 --> 00:48:34,936
That's because you came down here
and warned him.

430
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:51,130
Make a move and I'll kill you.

431
00:48:54,628 --> 00:48:57,228
Cole, start collecting them shotguns,

432
00:48:59,028 --> 00:49:03,526
uncork them rifles now
and set them down this end of the bar,

433
00:49:05,126 --> 00:49:06,724
Go on.

434
00:49:13,322 --> 00:49:16,422
Get back. Get back.

435
00:49:33,916 --> 00:49:36,114
Now, I'll take yours, Judge.

436
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,000
The drinks are on me, gentlemen.

437
00:50:25,598 --> 00:50:28,296
We're not drinking with you, Harden,
nor him, either.

438
00:50:28,796 --> 00:50:31,996
I ain't serving none of my liquor
to no bunch of tomato-kissing,

439
00:50:32,096 --> 00:50:34,394
- plow-pushing...
- Now, Judge,

440
00:50:34,694 --> 00:50:38,093
we don't want any harsh words
to spoil this friendly little get-together.

441
00:50:38,093 --> 00:50:40,092
JUDGE BEAN: Get-together?

442
00:50:40,192 --> 00:50:43,992
Why, this pack of weasels invade
the dignity of my courtroom,

443
00:50:44,592 --> 00:50:47,890
come in here armed with malice
aforethought to kick up a rumpus...

444
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:52,888
Now, look, you being a judge, you know
there's always two sides to any question.

445
00:50:53,188 --> 00:50:55,288
These men have come here
with a legitimate grievance.

446
00:50:55,388 --> 00:50:58,886
We're not asking you to speak
for us, Harden.

447
00:51:00,286 --> 00:51:04,484
Well, that makes it unanimous.
I'm going to talk for the both of you.

448
00:51:05,684 --> 00:51:07,484
There's a law here against fencing land

449
00:51:07,584 --> 00:51:10,482
that seems nothing short of murder
to people raising crops,

450
00:51:10,882 --> 00:51:13,880
but it's common sense
to men running cattle.

451
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,280
I've seen this kind of war before.
It's happening now,

452
00:51:20,178 --> 00:51:24,678
The cattlemen came in first,
then the homesteaders moved in

453
00:51:24,678 --> 00:51:28,976
They had crops for one year,
and then a dry spell, drought,

454
00:51:29,576 --> 00:51:33,274
so the homesteaders moved out,
and the rush and thistle

455
00:51:33,374 --> 00:51:36,274
And the big spaces were all broken
up by little quarter sections,

456
00:51:37,274 --> 00:51:38,472
and the homesteads left empty,

457
00:51:38,572 --> 00:51:41,871
and the houses caved in,
and the land, no good for man or cattle.

458
00:51:41,871 --> 00:51:46,170
You spoiled the land,
then you came here to spoil this land.

459
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:49,468
Yea, but it ain't big enough for cattlemen
and homesteaders, and it never will be.

460
00:51:49,568 --> 00:51:52,868
Now, clear out here. That's my ruling.

461
00:51:55,666 --> 00:51:58,166
All right, Bean, we're going.

462
00:51:59,066 --> 00:52:01,664
We're going back to build our fences.

463
00:52:01,864 --> 00:52:05,764
If you do, you better build coffins
along with them. Now, get.

464
00:52:56,246 --> 00:52:58,444
You sure told them off, son.

465
00:52:59,444 --> 00:53:03,544
Yep, and now I'm going to tell you off.
I'm sorry I stopped them

466
00:53:03,644 --> 00:53:05,642
They got a right
to defend their homesteads.

467
00:53:05,842 --> 00:53:08,442
You know this ain't homestead land.
You just said so yourself.

468
00:53:08,542 --> 00:53:11,840
- The government didn't say so.
- I'm the government here.

469
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:15,040
Judas Priest, I don't see how you can
talk up for scum like that.

470
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:17,238
They proved up on their land,
and they got deeds to it.

471
00:53:17,338 --> 00:53:21,336
When you make war on them,
you're making war

472
00:53:21,836 --> 00:53:23,436
Those people were starved out last year.

473
00:53:23,436 --> 00:53:26,436
I heard about those cattle being
stampeded over their crops,

474
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:29,434
and there's too many strays running loose
in that valley right now,

475
00:53:29,734 --> 00:53:31,734
only they're not strays.

476
00:53:33,033 --> 00:53:34,832
What do you want me to do?
Arrest them cattle,

477
00:53:34,832 --> 00:53:38,132
and fine them a couple dollars apiece
for trespass?

478
00:53:38,732 --> 00:53:40,030
Now, look,

479
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:45,528
those people don't take up much room
with their little shirt-sized pieces of land.

480
00:53:46,128 --> 00:53:49,528
Why don't you be a real judge
for all of the people?

481
00:53:50,228 --> 00:53:53,726
Why don't you try to see their side of it,
and help them instead of fight them?

482
00:53:54,726 --> 00:53:57,424
Make peace around here instead of war.

483
00:53:58,124 --> 00:54:02,422
There's plenty of room for everybody,
then everybody'd look up to you.

484
00:54:04,822 --> 00:54:09,120
And then someday, maybe they'd put up
a statue out there in the street,

485
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:15,018
a statue with a carving on it.
"To Roy Bean, the real judge."

486
00:54:17,618 --> 00:54:20,218
What are you doing? Catching a fish?

487
00:54:21,316 --> 00:54:24,916
I guess I'm wasting my time.
Hold on, wait a minute.

488
00:54:25,016 --> 00:54:27,914
- No!
- You promised. We drank on it.

489
00:54:29,014 --> 00:54:31,113
I didn't have to write it.
I had it on me all the time.

490
00:54:31,214 --> 00:54:34,412
You did?
Well, why didn't you give it to me then?

491
00:54:34,712 --> 00:54:39,610
You old bullhead, if I'd have given it
to you, you'd have hung me.

492
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:43,308
- I might've at that. Let's have a look at it.
- I haven't got it with me.

493
00:54:43,308 --> 00:54:47,808
Suffering, bleeding Chickamauga!
Where's it at?

494
00:54:48,008 --> 00:54:49,406
- How is she?
- Huh?

495
00:54:49,506 --> 00:54:52,406
- I'll ride right over with you.
- No, no.

496
00:54:52,606 --> 00:54:55,304
You mean you're gonna crawfish?
You ain't going to give it to me?

497
00:54:55,404 --> 00:54:58,004
- Sure, I'll give it to you.
- When?

498
00:54:58,204 --> 00:55:01,003
When the last steer's out of the valley.

499
00:55:01,102 --> 00:55:03,202
All right, I'll pass the word around
to the boys.

500
00:55:03,302 --> 00:55:05,902
No, you don't.
You're going to help run those cattle out,

501
00:55:06,001 --> 00:55:09,300
and I'm going along
with you to see that it's done.

502
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,500
Don't you trust me, Cole?

503
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:14,598
When I was a kid, I had a pet rattlesnake.

504
00:55:14,698 --> 00:55:18,096
I was fond of it,
but I wouldn't turn my back on it.

505
00:55:19,396 --> 00:55:20,996
(LAUGHING)

506
00:55:21,096 --> 00:55:22,696
You're all right.

507
00:55:23,196 --> 00:55:26,894
I'm going back now,
and gathering my stuff for the roundup.

508
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:32,392
- And that lock of hair.
- Yeah, yeah, the lock of hair.

509
00:55:45,388 --> 00:55:47,086
WADE: He defended Bean.
He said he was right.

510
00:55:47,386 --> 00:55:50,286
Said the homesteaders spoiled this land
for the cattlemen. We all heard it.

511
00:55:50,386 --> 00:55:53,884
JANE ELLEN: I don't care what you heard.
He couldn't be two-faced.

512
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:59,482
If he took Bean's part,
he only did it to stop trouble.

513
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:03,882
looks like every time I get into trouble,
you always speak up for me.

514
00:56:03,982 --> 00:56:06,380
They're trying to tell me
you spoke up for Bean.

515
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,779
Well, I did try to tell them
Bean's point of view.

516
00:56:10,779 --> 00:56:12,278
There you are.

517
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:15,378
It's always been my experience

518
00:56:15,378 --> 00:56:18,776
that when you know the other fellow's
point of view, you usually get together.

519
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:23,374
Well, why didn't you tell him
our point of view?

520
00:56:24,774 --> 00:56:27,674
You won't have
to patrol your fields any longer.

521
00:56:27,772 --> 00:56:29,772
Judge gave me his word they'd round up
all cattle in this valley

522
00:56:29,872 --> 00:56:32,072
and take them out of here.
(WADE SCOFFS)

523
00:56:32,172 --> 00:56:34,370
You think he'd keep his word?

524
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:37,470
Well, I'm going along with him
to see that he does.

525
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:40,668
Well, what makes you think
we'd take your word?

526
00:56:42,768 --> 00:56:44,568
Take it or leave it.

527
00:56:46,066 --> 00:56:47,366
Harden,

528
00:56:48,866 --> 00:56:50,964
you're a sneak and a liar.

529
00:57:20,654 --> 00:57:22,554
(COUGHING)

530
00:58:20,534 --> 00:58:21,934
Miss Mathews!

531
00:58:28,832 --> 00:58:30,230
I'll be back.

532
00:58:42,426 --> 00:58:44,326
California's that way.

533
00:58:46,826 --> 00:58:49,624
I got something to tell you before I go.

534
00:58:51,624 --> 00:58:53,922
- Well?
- How's Wade?

535
00:58:55,322 --> 00:58:57,822
He's fine, just fine.

536
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:05,018
You know,
you're not the prettiest girl I ever saw.

537
00:59:07,118 --> 00:59:09,816
Well, that's great news. Who asked you?

538
00:59:09,917 --> 00:59:12,916
But you've got the prettiest hair
I ever saw.

539
00:59:15,216 --> 00:59:17,714
Why do you like to make fun of me?

540
00:59:19,714 --> 00:59:21,812
'Cause I like you, I guess.

541
00:59:22,612 --> 00:59:27,812
- And you think my hair's pretty, huh?
- I never saw anything like it.

542
00:59:37,808 --> 00:59:41,306
- Oh, could I clip a lock?
- No, you can't.

543
00:59:42,606 --> 00:59:45,105
- Will you clip one?
- No, I won't.

544
00:59:45,804 --> 00:59:48,804
Come around here, take sides with Bean,

545
00:59:49,904 --> 00:59:52,502
and knock out my best friend, and...

546
00:59:52,602 --> 00:59:54,802
Tell you how much I like you,

547
00:59:56,202 --> 00:59:59,900
and how much I might miss you?

548
01:00:21,092 --> 01:00:22,792
- All right?
- No.

549
01:00:33,888 --> 01:00:35,788
Here, these are yours.

550
01:01:19,572 --> 01:01:22,472
Well, thanks a lot.

551
01:02:09,656 --> 01:02:11,254
WADE: Jane Ellen!

552
01:02:29,948 --> 01:02:31,648
Go on, Cole. Go on.

553
01:02:33,646 --> 01:02:38,546
Well, so I says to her...
I said, "Miss Langtry,

554
01:02:39,345 --> 01:02:43,644
"do you plan to go back to England
when you finish your American tour?"

555
01:02:43,744 --> 01:02:46,742
And she said to me... She said,

556
01:02:48,642 --> 01:02:52,740
"No." Said she loved
the United States too much.

557
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:56,540
- Yeah?
- She planned to stay here

558
01:02:58,338 --> 01:03:01,238
She told me that when she got
all through her work in the theater,

559
01:03:01,338 --> 01:03:06,236
that she wanted to settle down
someplace out here in the West.

560
01:03:07,336 --> 01:03:10,334
Some quiet little place
way out on the range,

561
01:03:10,334 --> 01:03:13,134
away from all the lights and the crowds.

562
01:03:16,132 --> 01:03:18,832
She kept asking about Texas especially.

563
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:26,628
She says that ever since she was
a little girl, she'd heard about Texas,

564
01:03:27,928 --> 01:03:32,226
and it'd always been the dream of her life
to have a home here someday.

565
01:03:33,126 --> 01:03:35,726
- She did?
- She did.

566
01:03:44,722 --> 01:03:47,222
Last herd just come in, Judge.

567
01:04:06,614 --> 01:04:07,914
Well?

568
01:04:08,414 --> 01:04:09,414
Huh?

569
01:04:14,712 --> 01:04:15,712
Oh.

570
01:05:41,982 --> 01:05:43,182
By gobs!

571
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:51,478
A lock of her own hair!

572
01:05:54,678 --> 01:05:56,876
It's kind of dark, ain't it?

573
01:06:00,976 --> 01:06:04,774
Yeah, she uses lots
of shampoo on her hair.

574
01:06:05,774 --> 01:06:08,372
It's beautiful. Beautiful.

575
01:06:10,772 --> 01:06:13,572
I'll never forget this, Cole. Never.

576
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:20,469
- Let me see it, will you?
- What for?

577
01:06:21,168 --> 01:06:23,168
I ain't going to keep it.

578
01:06:23,868 --> 01:06:25,866
I'd like to see you try.

579
01:06:35,664 --> 01:06:39,462
- All right?
- All right.

580
01:06:48,059 --> 01:06:50,058
I know how you feel, son.

581
01:07:03,654 --> 01:07:09,552
CALIPHET: Almighty God,
we offer thee thanksgiving for thy help

582
01:07:10,352 --> 01:07:13,250
Thou has poured thy blessings on our land.

583
01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:17,549
Thou hast visited
the Earth and made it plenteous

584
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:20,848
Thou hast made it soft with drops of rain,

585
01:07:20,948 --> 01:07:24,546
and the land that was desolate
has become like a garden,

586
01:07:25,246 --> 01:07:29,344
and the waste places are become fenced
and are inhabited

587
01:07:29,544 --> 01:07:32,944
Thou hast made the tree of the field
yield her fruit,

588
01:07:32,944 --> 01:07:35,042
and the Earth, her increase

589
01:07:35,444 --> 01:07:40,541
Thou hast broken the bonds of our yoke
and delivered us out of the hands

590
01:07:41,442 --> 01:07:46,340
so that we shall dwell here safely,
and none shall make us afraid,

591
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:52,437
and for this, thy divine bounty,
Oh, Lord, we thank thee. Amen.

592
01:07:52,937 --> 01:07:55,136
- HOMESTEADERS: Amen.
- Amen.

593
01:08:23,126 --> 01:08:27,524
(SINGING) One foot up
and the other foot down

594
01:08:35,222 --> 01:08:37,722
- JANE ELLEN: Here it is.
- What?

595
01:08:39,722 --> 01:08:41,720
Tell me something first.

596
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:45,220
Where do you keep my lock of hair?

597
01:08:45,319 --> 01:08:46,618
Oh, uh...

598
01:08:48,118 --> 01:08:49,317
Show me.

599
01:08:54,815 --> 01:08:57,415
Nobody can see that, not even you.

600
01:09:03,114 --> 01:09:07,211
Look, Cole, the best piece
of homestead land in the whole country.

601
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:12,209
It used to belong to one
of the hired men that left us,

602
01:09:12,310 --> 01:09:15,208
and now it's anybody's. You just claim it.

603
01:09:16,508 --> 01:09:19,508
Yeah, that's a fine piece of land all right.

604
01:09:19,508 --> 01:09:21,606
Yeah, look at the feed
on those slopes over there,

605
01:09:22,206 --> 01:09:26,104
and that strip along the bottom is just fine
for wheat or corn.

606
01:09:28,404 --> 01:09:31,502
And, Cole, look,
that little knoll right there,

607
01:09:32,702 --> 01:09:35,002
it's just begging for a house.

608
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:42,898
- Do you know how to build a house?
- No, how?

609
01:09:46,098 --> 01:09:48,596
Well, you... You...

610
01:09:52,896 --> 01:09:55,494
Well, you have the kitchen there,

611
01:09:57,294 --> 01:10:01,492
and the bedroom over there,
and the living room right in the middle.

612
01:10:02,293 --> 01:10:05,590
It would have to have
the right things in it, too.

613
01:10:06,690 --> 01:10:08,490
What sort of things?

614
01:10:09,190 --> 01:10:15,188
Oh, fires and lamplights, warm beds,

615
01:10:17,086 --> 01:10:21,186
the smell of coffee in the morning,
the sound of rain on the roof.

616
01:10:23,884 --> 01:10:27,084
Gee, that's a nice house, Jane Ellen.

620

we'll take a section of rail fence
and knock down a strip of corn.

621
01:11:13,867 --> 01:11:16,167
Maybe we can start a backfire.

622
01:11:21,466 --> 01:11:23,864

- Have you seen Jane Mathews?

631
01:16:30,458 --> 01:16:33,958
So I hereby christen this town Langtry!

No man ever gave a woman
a whole town afore, but I'm doing it,

633
01:16:42,754 --> 01:16:47,653
and from now on, this whole section's
going to bloom like the Jersey Lily herself!

Quiet! I ain't through yet.

635
01:16:54,450 --> 01:16:57,850
Miss Langtry's coming soon
to play a night in Fort Davis,

636
01:16:57,850 --> 01:17:00,648
and I want every legal resident
of Langtry, Texas,

637
01:17:00,748 --> 01:17:03,747
to go over and see
the godmother of this here town,

is liable to arrest for disorderly conduct,

I don't want
any of Roy Bean's friends around.

I didn't believe it then, but I do now.

657
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:18,980
You knew we were going to be burned out.
That's why you herded all the cattle out,

658
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:21,979
so they wouldn't be burned
with our crops.

659

No, I don't need your help. Not now.

Yeah, all right. And look
what I got to tell her when I see her.

to know you had nothing to do with it.

a thing like that?

how to spell my name.

01:28:58,702 --> 01:29:01,200
All right, boys, take your places.

745
01:29:09,997 --> 01:29:12,396
Hey, this is the stage entrance.

746
01:29:15,395 --> 01:29:19,494
Now, remember,
I want strict privacy all during the show.

747
01:29:36,488 --> 01:29:37,988
Third seat in.

748
01:29:57,180 --> 01:30:01,480
- Pardon, sir, your seat is back here.
- No, it ain't. It's right here.

749
01:30:46,564 --> 01:30:49,664
Say, when does Miss Langtry
go on the play?

750
01:30:50,062 --> 01:30:52,562
Right after the curtain.
She's about to go up now, sir.

751
01:30:52,662 --> 01:30:54,861
- Go up?
- The curtain, sir.

752
01:31:10,855 --> 01:31:12,056
Now?

753
01:31:13,354 --> 01:31:15,054
Yes, now.

754
01:31:18,652 --> 01:31:19,852
Now.

(ORCHESTRA PLAYING OVERTURE)

756
01:31:46,144 --> 01:31:49,542
Don't make a move, Judge.
I'm coming down to get you.

757
01:31:50,842 --> 01:31:52,342
Come shooting.

(GUN FIRING)

759
01:32:26,729 --> 01:32:30,128
- The war's on.
- Yeah.

760
01:32:30,428 --> 01:32:33,626

Hey!

763
01:33:56,299 --> 01:33:59,198
Let's you and me stand up
and shoot it out.

764
01:34:00,596 --> 01:34:02,396
That suits me, Judge.

765
01:34:04,196 --> 01:34:06,994
JUDGE BEAN: Put up your gun. We'll draw.

766

COLE: All right.

767
01:34:14,393 --> 01:34:16,192
- Ready?
- Yeah.

768
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:53,378
Now, you see what you done?

769
01:34:54,578 --> 01:34:56,378
You stopped the show.

770
01:34:56,778 --> 01:34:58,777
I was going to see Lily.

771
01:35:03,576 --> 01:35:05,674
Now it's too late.

772
01:35:06,374 --> 01:35:08,174
No, it isn't, Judge.

773
01:35:08,873 --> 01:35:11,672
She's back there now, waiting to see you.

774
01:35:14,472 --> 01:35:15,572
What?

775
01:35:16,672 --> 01:35:21,869
She knows all about you, Judge.
She wants to meet you.

776
01:35:24,568 --> 01:35:27,068
Come on, let's go back and see her.

777
01:35:33,766 --> 01:35:34,964
My hat.

778
01:36:03,654 --> 01:36:05,454
Where's Miss Langtry?

779
01:36:06,254 --> 01:36:08,253
Put me down. I can walk.

780
01:36:09,353 --> 01:36:12,252
Put me down, I tell you. That's my ruling.

See, what did I tell you?
They're coming back.

the biggest and the finest...
