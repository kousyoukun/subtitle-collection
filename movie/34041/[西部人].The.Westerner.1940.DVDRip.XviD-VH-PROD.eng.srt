It's against the law
to build fences hereabouts.

- Mine.

You're no more a judge than I am.
Just call yourself a judge.

91
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:41,836
I wouldn't say that if I was you.
I might consider it contempt of court.

92
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,849
It's contempt, all right.
You call this a court?

Bring in the horse, Chickenfoot.

100
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,701
Oh, yeah. Yeah, horse.

Come on, get over there.
Give us a little room.

108
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,951
All right, Judge, there he is.

109
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:33,263
Mr. Harden, it's my duty to inform you

110
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:37,564
that the larceny of an equine
is a capital offense, punishable by death,

111
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,032
but you can rest assured that,
in this court,

112
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:43,633
a horse thief always gets a fair trial
before he's hung.

113
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:48,442
- Chickenfoot, that's your horse?
- Oh, why, Judge...

114
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,072
Can you prove it's your horse?

115
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:54,950
Why, Judge, anybody here... I can prove
it by Pete himself that he's my horse.

116
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:58,223
Pete, you're my horse, ain't you?

117
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:02,553
Ownership of horse clearly established.
It belongs to Chickenfoot.

118
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:04,323
That's my ruling.

119
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,159
Well, I don't contest it, Your Honor.
Maybe the horse does belong

120
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,134
to Chickenfoot here, but I didn't steal it.

121
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:11,931

- I bought it.

No, it's not. I'm not going to stay here
and see anybody railroaded like this.

126
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,948
Miss Mathews, I don't recollect you was
summoned as a witness in this trial.

127
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,506
What kind of a trial is it when a prisoner

128
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,279
isn't even allowed to have anybody
speak for him?

129
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,377
You an attorney, Miss?

130
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,479
I'm as much an attorney
as you are a judge.

131
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:31,887
- You know this man?
- No, I don't.

132
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:33,185
- You ever see him before?
- No, but...

133
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,851
- Can you prove he didn't steal the horse?
- No.

134
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:37,623
Then he don't need no lawyer then.
This man was caught on a stolen horse,

135
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,460
and in this jurisdiction,
that's prima facie evidence.

136
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:43,969
- The case is closed and that's my ruling.
- Yes, and it's just like all your rulings!

137
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,968
The courtroom will now be cleared
of everybody,

138
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:53,068
excepting the judge, the jury, the prisoner,
the witnesses and...

139
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,204
I guess that means you.

140
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,478
All right, I'll go.
I don't want to see anymore.

141
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,585
It's murder, that's what it is. Murder.

142
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,747
This man hasn't got a chance,
and you know it,

143
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,586
but you never give anybody a chance.

144
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:08,889
You didn't give us one when you
stampeded the cattle over our crops.

145
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,657
You thought you'd starve
the homesteaders out, but you didn't.

146
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,928
You can pester us and rob us and kill us,
but you can't stop us.

147
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,560
'Cause there'll always be more coming.
More and more.

And we'll stay on our farms in spite of you,
and your courtroom and your killers!

If it wasn't for Lily, I'd marry her.

151

Giddap.

152
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:53,227
You heard the case against the accused,
pro and con.

153
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:57,069
Now I guess maybe you'd better retire
to consider a verdict.

(HORSE HOOVES CLOPPING)

155
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:02,778
Chickenfoot, you'd better take
Pete out for a little fresh air.

156
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:05,373
Take him out, Bart. I got work to do.

157
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:16,424
And while you retire,
there'll be a recess for them that's thirsty.

158
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,467
Well, I guess you can't take it with you.

159
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,737
It's got to be strictly understood

160
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:31,299
you ain't making no effort to influence
the sober judgment of the jury.

161
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,902
- Certainly not.
- There you are.

162
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:37,814
- Compliments of the prisoner.
- Jury to the rear!

- Join me, Your Honor?
- Don't mind if I do.

165

Don't spill none of that liquor, son.
It eats right into the bar.

To the unfortunate lady
with the bullet in her face.

167

was hauled out of here feet first.

169

of Lily Langtry ought to be killed.

170

171

Right.

174

Well, that's putting it mildly.

175
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,455

I ever met.

176

the real her, in the flesh?

How'd you get to know her?

181
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,635
Well, that's a long story, Judge.

182
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:19,841
Bart, you and Blackjack
get yourself a drink, huh?

183
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,681
Mighty fine liquor. What do you call it?

184
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,090
- Rub of the brush. Go on.
- Rub of the brush?

185
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:31,720
- Did you get to know her real well?
- It's got character.

186
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,566
I said, did you get to know her real well?

187
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:45,739
Now, Judge, you forget a gentleman
never discusses a lady in a barroom.

188
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:48,803
Who said it's a barroom?
This is a courtroom.

189
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:53,980
Say, tell me,
is she as pretty as them pictures?

190
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:59,714
Why, the picture's never been made
that can do justice to Lily Langtry.

191
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,521
Is she good-natured?

192
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,662
An angel.

193
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:13,665
- I'll never forget the night we met.
- Yeah?

194

I'll never forget it as long as I live.

Oh, that's Mort Borrow.
He cleans up around here.

197

198
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,210
Oh, yeah, Lily.

COWBOY 2: Stay once.

203
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,363
Get away from here.
You smell of formaldehyde!

204
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:14,990
I'll call that.

205
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,326
You been down around Lanno Bay,
ain't you?

206
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:18,734
Sure.

207
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:21,739
Well, you know how it is at sunset.

208
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:27,643
You can look out and that water ain't
exactly blue, and it ain't exactly purple.

209

but he can't put a name to.

and coppery and gold-like

is running in the bright sun?

217
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:06,306
- Yeah.
- Well, her hair is something like that.

218
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:10,578
In the daytime.

219
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,291
You mean it's different at night?

220
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:16,759
Well, not different,
but just sort of more so.

221
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:20,096
- How so?
- Well...

222
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:26,226
Well, you know how it is at dusk when
you see a prairie fire reflected in the sky.

223
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:32,838
A sort of a deep...
A beautiful kind of blushing...

224
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:34,973
- Red?
- Red.

225
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:41,145
- Well, that'll give you a rough idea.
- By gobs.

226
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,452
I got a lock of her hair.

(JUDGE BEAN STUTTERS)

228

You mean to tell me you actually got
the real... From her head?

229
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:04,535
I don't suppose you'd ever part
with that lock of hair,

230
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,340
no matter what a man was willing to give?

231
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:11,505
A man don't trade things like that.

232
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,614
You see that sword up there?

233
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:21,820
I wore it in the civil war.
Always meant to be buried with it.

234
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,192
Now, if you was willing to swap, why...

235
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:27,962
Would you really like to have it?

236
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:32,163
I'd rather own it than the state of Texas.
Let's have a look at it.

237
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,864
I haven't got it with me.

238
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:41,635
Where's it at?

239
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,178
It's with my stuff in El Paso.

240
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,549
So, you was in the civil war, huh, Judge?

241
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,645
- El Paso, huh?
- Yeah.

242
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,354
- Cavalry, huh?
- I suppose you could write for it.

243

Yeah.

- Two or three weeks, huh?
- Yeah, about.

247
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:31,925
But I wouldn't part with that lock of hair
for anything in the world.

- What's the verdict?
- You know what the verdict is. Guilty.

253

There's only one thing I can do.

254
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,335
You're sentenced to hang,
that's my ruling.

255
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:17,807
Turn loose the prisoner's hands.

256
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:21,403
- But, Judge, you just ruled...
- I didn't finish my ruling.

257
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,646
The court sentenced the prisoner to hang,

258
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:30,347
but the court didn't say when.
So long as there's reasonable doubt...

259
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,117
What reasonable doubt, Judge?

260
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,885
We just caught him
with Chickenfoot's horse.

261

- Ain't any room for doubt.
- Order!

262
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:42,557
I been talking to the prisoner.
He's a friend of Lily Langtry's.

263
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:47,800
Stands to reason no friend of Lily Langtry
goes around stealing horses.

264
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,670
Leastways, there's a reasonable doubt.

265
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,834
You mean,
you're setting aside your own ruling?

266
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,970
That ain't what I said.
When I make a ruling, it stands.

267
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,674
But, Judge, you just sentenced the man.

268
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,579
His sentence is suspended

269
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,278
for a couple weeks
until I can look into the matter further.

270

Pardon me, you don't happen
to have a twin brother, do you?

277
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:58,567
No, not me.

278
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,738
Well, you'd better pay me that money
you owe me:

279
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:05,746
You're loco, brother.
I don't owe you nothing.

280
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,341
You owe me $60.

281

$60.

282

If you're interested, that's the man
that sold me the roan horse.

Then, he's the man that stole...

$84 and 6 bits.

285
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:08,438

Now, you men get some rope
and string him up.

String him up? Why, he's dead already.

String him up!

You can have his horse and outfit.

00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,488
Straighten out my neck, would you?
Grab a hold of my head.

305
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:26,717
Now, jerk it quick.

306
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:27,815
(CLICK)

307
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,358
Thank you. It's my neck.

308
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:37,097
You see I was hung once,
but my friends cut me down in time.

309
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:41,402
Now when I don't live right,
why, the crick comes back on me.

310
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:50,937
(WHISTLING SOFTLY)

311
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:04,491
Now, who are you, anyhow?
And what are you doing here?

312
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,957
Why, don't you remember?

313
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:10,763
Why, I'm the fellow
that filled the inside straight,

314
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:12,632
and won Chickenfoot's horse.

315
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:17,532
So long, Judge.

316
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:30,785
Hey, Pete, are you glad
I won you from Chickenfoot?

317
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,146
Well, that makes it nice.

318
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:34,747
Here.

319
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,370
Wait!

320
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:31,840
Wait!

321
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,390
That lock of hair, Lily's hair,

322
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:30,700
you promised to write to El Paso for it.
Don't you remember? We drank on it.

323
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:33,829
When are you going to do it?

324
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:41,367
Huh?

325
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:47,811
- You ain't going to crawfish?
- No, the first post office I come to.

326
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:51,286
Straighten her out, would you, son?

327
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,490
Thank you.

328
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:08,797
You mangy old scorpion,
you might have got us both killed.

329
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:13,235
(LAUGHING)

330
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:25,083
- What you want to go to California for?
- See the Pacific Ocean.

331
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:27,954
It's just like the gulf down at Lanno Bay.

332
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,657
It's bigger.

333
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:33,728
Why don't you stay around
Vinegarroon awhile?

334
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:37,631
We could have a lot of fun together.
We could talk about Lily and...

335
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:40,466
No, I'm on my way.

336
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:43,400
Listen,

337
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:48,336
it's a great country here,
west of the Pecos.

338
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:51,040
A fellow could really make something
of himself.

339
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:53,913
Why, when I first come here,
I didn't have nothing.

340
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,476
Now, I'm boss of the whole section.

341
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,816
Well, that's mighty fine, Judge.

342
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:03,861
You know, I cottoned to you
the first time I seen you.

343
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,953
Why don't you put in with me?

344
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,261
Well, I tell you, Judge,
it's nice of you to ask me,

345
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:15,363
but I'm heading for California,
and nothing short of hanging can stop me.

346
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:21,139
Wait a minute. You can't go.
You're under suspended sentence.

347
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:23,373
- Why, you hung Mr. Evans for that.
- Huh?

348
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:25,438
You're under suspendence, anyhow.

349
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,644
Who are you? What do I know about you?
How do I know they ain't looking for you?

350
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:33,486
You're under arrest for disorderly conduct,
for disturbing the peace, vagrancy,

351
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:36,823
and you're on the way back to town
with me, and that's my ruling!

352
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:38,418
So long, Judge.

353
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,209
By gobs, he stole my gun.

354
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:14,624
We hired out for farm work, Miss,
not a civil war.

355
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:16,667
This ain't no fit place to homestead in.

356
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,759
Land's no good when there's
always lead flying over it.

357
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:20,599
If you'd shoot back,
maybe they'd stop bothering you.

358
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:21,763
We did shoot back.

359
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:25,036
And so did Shad Wilkins,
and he ain't trying it no more.

360
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:27,009
What about your own quarter section?

361
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,638
- Lf you leave, you'll lose it.
- We don't want no part of it.

362
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:31,409
All right, Hod. If you feel that way,

363
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:34,007
we'll try to get along
with just Eph and Henry.

364
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,279
Not me.

365
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:41,485
Henry, if we only had one man,
it'd be a big help.

366
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,288
Sorry, Mr. Mathews.

367
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,167
JANE ELLEN: Call themselves men.

368
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:04,306
Wade, what do we do?

369
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:13,915
- I know what to do.
- No, no, wait. That's not the way.

370
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:15,856
Don't even think of it.

371
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:20,596
Wade, aren't you going to stay for supper?

372
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:22,499
I'll be back.

373
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:38,606
Well, they left.

374
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,583
Of course they have. What did you expect?

375
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,482
My hands quit, too.
You can't blame them for leaving.

376
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:44,544
There won't be a hired man left
in this part of the country

377
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:46,055
if we don't do something about it.

378
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:48,455
We hire new hands,
same thing will happen.

379
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:50,426
What's old Mathews going to say about it?

380
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:53,463
He keeps passing the buck
to the Lord Jehovah.

381
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:55,465
I say, let's do something
about it ourselves.

382
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:57,364
- That's right.
- That's what I like to hear.

383
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:59,835
Let's give the judge the same thing
he gave Shad Wilkins.

384
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:04,364
Maybe if some of us went down
and appealed to Roy Bean for justice...

385
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:08,606
Justice. If you'd seen him yesterday,
pretending to try that prisoner...

386
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,340
The man didn't have a chance.

387
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:13,440
- I wonder if they hanged him.
- Don't they always?

388
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,452
He was the same as dead
even while he stood there.

389
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,114
I've kept on seeing his face all day.

390
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:24,316
(EX CLAIMS)

391
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,662
What is it, Daughter?

392
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:32,294
The man I told you about,
the one that was hanged.

393
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,430
I saw him plain as day,
looking in the window.

394
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:42,440
You're seeing things, Jane Ellen.
There's nobody out there.

395
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,673
I saw his face, I tell you.

396
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:47,606
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

397
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:50,644
Come in.

398
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,080
Good evening.

399
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,598
Pardon me for intruding like this.

400
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:10,163
(STAMMERING) Oh, no, you're not.
It's just... Well, I thought you were a ghost.

401
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:14,642
Well, I guess
you're partly to blame I'm not.

402
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:18,671
- I just stopped in to thank you.
- Father, this is Mister...

403
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:22,241
- Harden.
- Welcome, Mr. Harden, welcome.

404
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:24,280
Glad to meet you.

405
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:29,520
Oh, Mr. Harden,
this is our neighbor Wade Harper.

406
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:32,092
This is the man I told you about.

407
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:35,030
You mean to tell me Bean tried you,
and let you go?

408
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:38,000
Well, she was my lawyer.
I guess she's the one that got me off.

409
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:40,400
- I knew you weren't a horse thief.
- Thanks.

410
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,637
How did you know that?

411
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:46,733
I just knew.

412
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,269
Are you working anywhere?

413
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:54,139
No, I'm heading for California.

414
00:40:54,852 --> 00:41:00,415
Mr. Harden, I suppose a body that's just
been hanged is apt to be a bit hungry.

415
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:02,482
You must stay for supper.

416
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:09,458
- Well, I don't want to put you out any.
- Oh, no, not at all.

417
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:12,559
Matter of fact, we had some company
that just disappointed us.

418
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:16,037
Uh-huh. We were hoping somebody'd
show up to take their place.

419
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:19,337
Make yourself at home, now.
Make yourself at home.

420
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:27,979
Wait till you sink your teeth
into some of Jane Ellen's stew.

421
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:41,325
CALIPHET: Oh, Lord, for that which thou
hast sent us in our hour of need,

422
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,291
make us truly grateful.

423
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:49,570
Bless this food to our use and ourselves
to thy service. Amen.

424
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:52,066
Let me help you.

425
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:55,602
How about some hominy?

426
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,340
- Here, Wade. Give him some milk.
- All right, all right.

427
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:59,177
Give him some milk.

428
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:04,151
I think he likes it here. I think we got him.

429
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:06,655
- What's he doing now?
- Feeding his horse.

430
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:11,491
Wade, he could probably take the place
of two men. He's so big and strong.

431
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:14,963
- Well, I don't know how strong he is.
- Strong enough, Wade.

432
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,660
Now, Jane Ellen,
we'll leave you alone with him,

433
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:19,965
and you kind of add on
a little more welcome.

434
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:22,631
- What'll I say?
- Oh, just keep smiling at him.

435
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:27,439
And, Daughter,
if it should come up natural-like,

436
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:30,810
you might hint
what a handsome man he is.

437
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:32,676
Handsome?

438
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:36,948
We need him terribly bad, Daughter.
We got to get that corn husked.

439
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:38,987
We need him terribly bad.

440
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,422
- Listen, your father don't mean for you to...
- Shh.

441
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:42,789
Look out.

442
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:46,693
Everything all right, Mr. Harden?

443
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:49,562
- Fine, thanks.
- Good. Now, I'll go see about your bunk.

444
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:52,431
- Oh, don't trouble.
- No trouble at all. Come on, Wade.

445
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:07,881
- Can I give you a hand?
- Oh, no, thanks.

446
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:12,283
- Won't you sit down, please?
- Well, I won't argue with you.

447
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,892
If I had to wash dishes,
I guess I'd give up eating.

448
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,588
Well, what do you do
about the dishes when you're home?

449
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:20,823
Home? What? You mean in a house?

450
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:23,098
Well, you live in a house, don't you?

451
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:28,637
No. No, my house is all out there,
all one room with a sky for a roof.

452
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:33,641
- Well, it's a big place.
- Got some space to rent.

453
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:38,706
Well, I guess California's
your next stop, huh?

454
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:44,186
California, but I don't stop.
Oregon next, I guess.

455
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:47,481
Well, all places aren't just the same.

456
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:51,152
Wouldn't you rather stay
a little longer in some places?

457
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:53,958
No, they're all the same,
beautiful when you leave them.

458
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:57,698
Well, it's like the turtles.
Carry their houses with them.

459
00:43:57,768 --> 00:44:00,168
If I had to build me a house,
I'd have it on wheels.

460
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:05,132
Not me. I'd want my house
so that nothing could ever move it.

461
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:08,474
So down deep
that an earthquake couldn't shake it,

462
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:12,239
and a cyclone would be
just another wind going by.

463
00:44:14,518 --> 00:44:18,579
Well, you say, "Who wants to be a turtle?"

464
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:23,121
And I say, "I hope you'll be
very happy in your house."

465
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:36,735
- Well...
- Oh, say, wait a minute.

466
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:38,138
What?

467
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:40,574
I'll bet I know something
we could agree on.

468
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:41,736
What's that?

469
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:44,747
Well, in about a week now,
we're going to husk the corn,

470
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:47,541
and I'll bet you'll agree that that's fun.

471
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:48,607
(EX CLAIMS QUESTIONINGLY)

472
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,883
Well, you know, I think husking
corn's the greatest fun in the world.

473
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,215
- Husking corn, fun?
- Oh, yes!

474
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:00,323
- Well, I'd rather wash dishes.
- Oh, no.

475
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:06,632
It was a fine supper, and good cooking.

476
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:11,531
Oh, Mr. Harden.

477
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:20,946
What a handsome man you are.

478
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:26,244
(SIGHS)

479
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:28,625
I doubt that, but I'm a tired one.

480
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:32,059
Well, I hope I see you
in the morning before I leave.

481
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:41,597
Get out of here! Hey!

482
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:55,808
If anybody'd told me yesterday
I'd be playing tag in a cornfield

483
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:57,877
with a lot of cows...

484
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,519
If we had some men that would ride fence,

485
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:03,492
there wouldn't be any cows
in the cornfield.

486
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,291
You were sure cute last night.

487
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,099
Now you're making fun of me.

488
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:14,763
Well, that's...
That's more fun than picking corn.

489
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:23,877
Hey, look at your father.
I wonder what's up.

490
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:34,248
I tried to stop them.
They wouldn't listen to me.

491
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:35,313
Wade!

492
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:37,952
Yes, yes.
It's the wrong and lawless thing to do.

493
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:41,691
- I begged them not to. I told them.
- Who? What happened?

494
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:44,097
Wade Harper has rounded up
some of the men.

495
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:46,329
They going to town to lynch Judge Bean.

496
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:48,234
- When did they leave?
- About an hour ago.

497
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,636
They took our wagon.

498
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:49,497
Thunder and lightning!
You back from California already?

499
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:51,363
You got to get out of here,
and don't stop for nothing.

500
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:52,424
Did you write to El Paso?

501
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:54,800
Listen, just get on your horse and get,
because they're after you.

502
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:57,466
Did you write? Who's after me?

503
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:59,768
The homesteaders.
They're going to string you up.

504
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:02,107
Why, that bunch of plow-pushing sod!

505
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:04,647
They're outside right now,
a whole wagonload of them.

506
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,912
A wagonload?
Why, I can handle a train load of them.

507
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:10,377
I'll tear their livers out.

508
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:35,875
What'll it be, gentlemen?

509
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:38,974
It'll be Roy Bean. Where is he?

510
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:42,346
He's out for a while.

511
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,917
That's because you came down here
and warned him.

512
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:02,965
Make a move and I'll kill you.

513
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,635
Cole, start collecting them shotguns,

514
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:14,449
uncork them rifles now
and set them down this end of the bar,

515
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:15,507
easy-like.

516
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:18,781
Go on.

517
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:28,490
Get back. Get back.

518
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:48,042
Now, I'll take yours, Judge.

519
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:33,060
The drinks are on me, gentlemen.

520
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:40,397
We're not drinking with you, Harden,
nor him, either.

521
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:44,034
I ain't serving none of my liquor
to no bunch of tomato-kissing,

522
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:46,405
- plow-pushing...
- Now, Judge,

523
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:50,110
we don't want any harsh words
to spoil this friendly little get-together.

524
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:51,374
JUDGE BEAN: Get-together?

525
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:55,844
Why, this pack of weasels invade
the dignity of my courtroom,

526
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,987
come in here armed with malice
aforethought to kick up a rumpus...

527
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:04,617
Now, look, you being a judge, you know
there's always two sides to any question.

528
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:07,388
These men have come here
with a legitimate grievance.

529
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:09,659
We're not asking you to speak
for us, Harden.

530
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,960
JUDGE BEAN: No, nor me, either.

531
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:15,498
Well, that makes it unanimous.
I'm going to talk for the both of you.

532
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,538
There's a law here against fencing land

533
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:22,578
that seems nothing short of murder
to people raising crops,

534
00:51:22,946 --> 00:51:24,880
but it's common sense
to men running cattle.

535
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:28,908
I've seen this kind of war before.

536
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:31,317
It's happening now,
back in Kansas and Nebraska.

537
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,916
The cattlemen came in first,

538
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:36,720
then the homesteaders moved in
and fenced them out.

539
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:41,025
They had crops for one year,
and then a dry spell, drought,

540
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:42,859
so the homesteaders moved out,

541
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,367
and the rush and thistle
and jimson moved in.

542
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:48,302
And the big spaces were all broken
up by little quarter sections,

543
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:50,566
and the homesteads left empty,

544
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,905
and the houses caved in,
and the land, no good for man or cattle.

545
00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:56,775
You spoiled the land,
then you came here to spoil this land.

546
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:58,246
This here's a big country.

547
00:51:58,315 --> 00:52:01,546
Yea, but it ain't big enough for cattlemen
and homesteaders, and it never will be.

548
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:04,917
Now, clear out here. That's my ruling.

549
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,282
All right, Bean, we're going.

550
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,688
We're going back to build our fences.

551
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:17,661
If you do, you better build coffins
along with them. Now, get.

552
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:10,410
You sure told them off, son.

553
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,352
Yep, and now I'm going to tell you off.

554
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:15,687
I'm sorry I stopped them
from lynching you.

555
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:17,784
They got a right
to defend their homesteads.

556
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:20,555
You know this ain't homestead land.
You just said so yourself.

557
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:23,963
- The government didn't say so.
- I'm the government here.

558
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:27,162
Judas Priest, I don't see how you can
talk up for scum like that.

559
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:29,364
They proved up on their land,
and they got deeds to it.

560
00:53:29,439 --> 00:53:31,134
When you make war on them,
you're making war

561
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,403
on their women and kids, too.

562
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:35,502
Those people were starved out last year.

563
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:38,571
I heard about those cattle being
stampeded over their crops,

564
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:41,583
and there's too many strays running loose
in that valley right now,

565
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:43,615
only they're not strays.

566
00:53:45,188 --> 00:53:46,917
What do you want me to do?
Arrest them cattle,

567
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:49,424
and fine them a couple dollars apiece
for trespass?

568
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:51,883
Now, look,

569
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:57,199
those people don't take up much room
with their little shirt-sized pieces of land.

570
00:53:58,201 --> 00:54:01,034
Why don't you be a real judge
for all of the people?

571
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:05,808
Why don't you try to see their side of it,
and help them instead of fight them?

572
00:54:06,843 --> 00:54:09,471
Make peace around here instead of war.

573
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:14,478
There's plenty of room for everybody,
then everybody'd look up to you.

574
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,253
And then someday, maybe they'd put up
a statue out there in the street,

575
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:27,118
a statue with a carving on it.
"To Roy Bean, the real judge."

576
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:31,894
What are you doing? Catching a fish?

577
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:34,767
I guess I'm wasting my time.

578
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:37,068
Hold on, wait a minute.
You write that letter to El Paso yet?

579
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:40,041
- No!
- You promised. We drank on it.

580
00:54:41,144 --> 00:54:43,271
I didn't have to write it.
I had it on me all the time.

581
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:45,678
You did?
Well, why didn't you give it to me then?

582
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:50,182
You old bullhead, if I'd have given it
to you, you'd have hung me.

583
00:54:50,253 --> 00:54:51,743
Wouldn't you?

584
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:55,423
- I might've at that. Let's have a look at it.
- I haven't got it with me.

585
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:57,483
Suffering, bleeding Chickamauga!
Where's it at?

586
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,989
I left it over at the Mathews' place.

587
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:01,561
- How is she?
- Huh?

588
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:03,928
- I'll ride right over with you.
- No, no.

589
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:07,464
You mean you're gonna crawfish?
You ain't going to give it to me?

590
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:09,800
- Sure, I'll give it to you.
- When?

591
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:13,036
When the last steer's out of the valley.

592
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:15,335
All right, I'll pass the word around
to the boys.

593
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:18,074
No, you don't.
You're going to help run those cattle out,

594
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:21,379
and I'm going along
with you to see that it's done.

595
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,642
Don't you trust me, Cole?

596
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:26,751
When I was a kid, I had a pet rattlesnake.

597
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:30,156
I was fond of it,
but I wouldn't turn my back on it.

598
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:33,155
(LAUGHING)

599
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:34,594
You're all right.

600
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:38,528
I'm going back now,
and gathering my stuff for the roundup.

601
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:44,134
- And that lock of hair.
- Yeah, yeah, the lock of hair.

602
00:55:57,554 --> 00:55:59,215
WADE: He defended Bean.
He said he was right.

603
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:02,490
Said the homesteaders spoiled this land
for the cattlemen. We all heard it.

00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,254
JANE ELLEN: I don't care what you heard.

605
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:06,090
He couldn't be two-faced.
He's not that kind.

606
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,089
If he took Bean's part,
he only did it to stop trouble.

607
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,667
Miss Mathews,

608
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:16,036
looks like every time I get into trouble,
you always speak up for me.

609
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:18,574
They're trying to tell me
you spoke up for Bean.

610
00:56:18,641 --> 00:56:22,907
Well, I did try to tell them
Bean's point of view.

611
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:23,968
There you are.

612
00:56:25,281 --> 00:56:27,442
It's always been my experience

613
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:30,918
that when you know the other fellow's
point of view, you usually get together.

614
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:34,089
Well, why didn't you tell him
our point of view?

615
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:35,556
I did, and we got together.

616
00:56:36,926 --> 00:56:39,861
You won't have
to patrol your fields any longer.

617
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:41,988
Judge gave me his word they'd round up
all cattle in this valley

618
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,157
and take them out of here.

620
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:46,529
You think he'd keep his word?

621
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:49,632
Well, I'm going along with him
to see that he does.

622
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:52,573
Well, what makes you think
we'd take your word?

623
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:56,172
Take it or leave it.

624
00:56:58,214 --> 00:56:59,545
Harden,

625
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:03,143

630
00:58:59,002 --> 00:59:01,266
I got something to tell you before I go.

631
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:06,171
- Well?
- How's Wade?

632
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:10,012
He's fine, just fine.

633

You know,
you're not the prettiest girl I ever saw.

634
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:21,483
Well, that's great news. Who asked you?

635
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:24,649
But you've got the prettiest hair
I ever saw.

636
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:29,523
Why do you like to make fun of me?

637
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:33,334
'Cause I like you, I guess.

638
00:59:34,804 --> 00:59:40,037
- And you think my hair's pretty, huh?
- I never saw anything like it.

639
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:53,511
- Oh, could I clip a lock?
- No, you can't.

640
00:59:54,824 --> 00:59:57,156
- Will you clip one?
- No, I won't.

641
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:01,086
Come around here, take sides with Bean,

642

643
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:06,334
Tell you how much I like you,

644
01:00:08,471 --> 01:00:12,100
and how much I might miss you?

645
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:35,091

- No.

WADE: Jane Ellen!

649
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:43,886
Go on, Cole. Go on.

650
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:50,865
Well, so I says to her...
I said, "Miss Langtry,

651
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:54,568
"do you plan to go back to England
when you finish your American tour?"

652
01:02:56,072 --> 01:02:59,064
And she said to me... She said,

653
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:05,040
"No." Said she loved
the United States too much.

654
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:06,705
- Yeah?
- She planned to stay here

655
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,876
for the rest of her life.

656
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,555
She told me that when she got
all through her work in the theater,

657
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:16,319
that she wanted to settle down
someplace out here in the West.

658
01:03:17,326 --> 01:03:18,554
By gobs.

659
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:22,564
Some quiet little place
way out on the range,

660
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:25,362
away from all the lights and the crowds.

661
01:03:28,437 --> 01:03:30,871
She kept asking about Texas especially.

662
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:38,776
She says that ever since she was
a little girl, she'd heard about Texas,

663
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:44,344
and it'd always been the dream of her life
to have a home here someday.

664
01:03:45,454 --> 01:03:48,014
- She did?
- She did.

665
01:03:57,066 --> 01:03:59,557
Last herd just come in, Judge.

666
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:20,286
Well?

667
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:21,745
Huh?

668
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:28,018
Oh.

669

By gobs!

670
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:03,549
A lock of her own hair!

671
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:08,587
It's kind of dark, ain't it?

672
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:16,032
Yeah, she uses lots
of shampoo on her hair.

673
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:17,127
She does?

674
01:06:18,174 --> 01:06:20,734
It's beautiful. Beautiful.

675
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:25,979
I'll never forget this, Cole. Never.

676
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:32,484
- Let me see it, will you?
- What for?

677
01:06:33,556 --> 01:06:35,421
I ain't going to keep it.

678
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:38,283
I'd like to see you try.

679
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:51,836

- All right.

Thou has poured thy blessings on our land.

684
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:29,974
Thou hast visited
the Earth and made it plenteous

685
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:33,206
Thou hast made it soft with drops of rain,

686
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:36,909
and the land that was desolate
has become like a garden,

687
01:07:37,686 --> 01:07:41,713
and the waste places are become fenced
and are inhabited

688
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:45,290
Thou hast made the tree of the field
yield her fruit,

689
01:07:45,361 --> 01:07:46,988
and the Earth, her increase

690
01:07:47,863 --> 01:07:50,297
Thou hast broken the bonds of our yoke

691
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:52,994
and delivered us out of the hands
of our enemies,

692
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:58,739
so that we shall dwell here safely,
and none shall make us afraid,

Oh, Lord, we thank thee. Amen.

Nobody can see that, not even you.

Look, Cole, the best piece
of homestead land in the whole country.

704
01:09:21,957 --> 01:09:24,653
It used to belong to one
of the hired men that left us,

and now it's anybody's. You just claim it.

706
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:31,831
Yeah, that's a fine piece of land all right.

707
01:09:31,967 --> 01:09:34,026
Yeah, look at the feed
on those slopes over there,

708
01:09:34,637 --> 01:09:37,970
and that strip along the bottom is just fine
for wheat or corn.

709
01:09:40,809 --> 01:09:43,437
And, Cole, look,
that little knoll right there,

710
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:47,377
it's just begging for a house.

01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:55,347
- Do you know how to build a house?
- No, how?

712
01:09:58,527 --> 01:10:01,052
Well, you... You...

713
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:07,927
Well, you have the kitchen there,

and the bedroom over there,
and the living room right in the middle.

It would have to have
the right things in it, too.

I'll be here long after Bean and his gang
of murderers are gone.

760
01:20:15,277 --> 01:20:18,041
Sure you will, and me, too.

761
01:20:19,714 --> 01:20:20,703
I don't want you.

762
01:20:21,883 --> 01:20:24,613
I don't want
any of Roy Bean's friends around.

I didn't believe it then, but I do now.

You knew we were going to be burned out.

765
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:33,657
That's why you herded all the cattle out,

766
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:36,094
so they wouldn't be burned
with our crops.

767
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:43,129
No, I don't need your help. Not now.

768
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,740
I can do what I have to do alone.

769

Why, Cole!

773
01:21:36,491 --> 01:21:38,550
By gobs, man, I'm glad to see you.

774
01:21:38,627 --> 01:21:40,925
Why, I never wanted to see
a man so much before in my life.

775
01:21:40,996 --> 01:21:42,395
- What for?
- What for?

776
01:21:42,464 --> 01:21:45,160
Don't you know what for?
She's coming to Fort Davis.

777
01:21:45,433 --> 01:21:48,266
- Lily Langtry's coming to Fort Davis.
- Langtry?

778
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:50,530
Langtry, yeah, and you and me
are going over there together.

779
01:21:50,605 --> 01:21:53,403
You're going to introduce me to her.
By gobs, I'm going to meet her.

780
01:21:53,475 --> 01:21:55,340
- I just can't believe it.
- I want to talk to you, Judge.

781
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:57,435
Yeah, all right. And look
what I got to tell her when I see her.

782
01:21:57,512 --> 01:22:01,414
Langtry, that's the name of this town,
a great town after a great woman.

783
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,980
- I said I wanted to talk to you, Judge.
- Sure.

01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:07,613
Cole, it's a great day.

785
01:22:07,689 --> 01:22:10,487
I tell you, it's the greatest day
in the history of Texas.

786
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:16,958
- Some fire, huh?
- Yeah, wasn't it, though?

787
01:22:17,032 --> 01:22:19,592
- Yeah, too bad.
- Yeah.

788
01:22:20,835 --> 01:22:21,824
Yep.

789
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:25,362
- I wonder who was behind it?
- Oh, a fire don't need nothing behind it.

790
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:28,238
Fire has a way of moving on its own.
Here's how.

791
01:22:31,146 --> 01:22:34,081
Before I drink with you, Judge, I want
to know you had nothing to do with it.

792
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:36,617
Me? Why, how can you say
a thing like that?

793
01:22:36,751 --> 01:22:38,309
Didn't I round up all them cattle for you?

794
01:22:38,386 --> 01:22:40,718
Wasn't I right here in the saloon
when the fire broke out?

795

Didn't...

796
01:22:44,426 --> 01:22:47,953
Well, I was, and what's more,
I ain't got no idea who done it.

797
01:22:49,531 --> 01:22:51,055
Now, drink up.

798
01:22:56,404 --> 01:22:58,372
- Don't you believe me?
- No.

799
01:23:01,609 --> 01:23:06,512
Now, listen, son, I told you how it was,
and I don't want you calling me no liar.

800
01:23:07,716 --> 01:23:09,343
Now, drink hearty.

801
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:14,010
Will you swear by that?

802
01:23:15,623 --> 01:23:17,716
There ain't no reason I should,
but I'm willing.

803
01:23:18,226 --> 01:23:21,491
All right, I swear by my sword there
I had nothing to do with it.

I swear by the revised statutes.

- Let me see it.

Swear on that?

809
01:23:47,455 --> 01:23:49,787
All right, it was me.
I burned their houses and crops.

810
01:23:49,891 --> 01:23:52,451
- I run them varmints out.
- Nice going.

And if you think...

812
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:58,256
If you think I'm sorry, you're crazy.

813
01:23:58,333 --> 01:24:00,733
I'm proud and glad I rid
the country of them.

814
01:24:00,802 --> 01:24:04,329
It was either them or us,
and now the range grass will grow back,

815
01:24:04,406 --> 01:24:06,533
and some day,
the cattlemen will put up a statue of me

816
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:08,576
out there on the street,
and they'll write on it,

817
01:24:08,643 --> 01:24:11,908
"Judge Roy Bean,
he give us back the land."

You get warrants in Fort Davis, don't you?

819
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:17,643
Yeah, that's where they get them,

820
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:18,947
but they don't know
how to spell my name.

821
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:20,851
- It's been tried before.
- I'll get one.

822

what's coming to you, Judge.

and you think it was wrong.

But if it was my own son come
over here with a warrant,

826
01:24:36,104 --> 01:24:37,901
he'd have to be first on the draw.

827

I aim to be, unless I get it in the back
before I get out of here.

828
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:27,117
So long, Cole.

829
01:25:38,666 --> 01:25:40,497
Make out a warrant against Roy Bean.

830

to carry out the duties of deputy sheriff

- Four hundred.

- I'll take them.
- How many?
