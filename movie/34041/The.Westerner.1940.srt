1
00:01:55,556 --> 00:01:56,852
Hey, wire.

2
00:01:56,923 --> 00:01:58,617
Wire. They've
drawn a fence across there.

3
00:01:58,691 --> 00:02:01,181
Them plow-pushers must have
put it up there last night.

4
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:03,316
Give me them wire cutters.

5
00:02:13,496 --> 00:02:15,019
I'll fix this.

6
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:24,097
Cow herders!

7
00:02:32,171 --> 00:02:33,831
Hey, cornhuskers!

8
00:03:24,457 --> 00:03:27,289
Shad Wilkins, you've
been tried and found guilty

9
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:30,326
of the most serious crime west of the Pecos,

10
00:03:30,393 --> 00:03:32,223
to wit, shooting a steer.

11
00:03:33,394 --> 00:03:36,452
Got anything to say for yourself before
the sentence of the court is executed?

12
00:03:36,528 --> 00:03:38,358
I told you they shot at me first!

13
00:03:38,429 --> 00:03:40,191
I didn't mean to kill that steer on purpose!

14
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:41,752
I was aiming at the man.

15
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:45,889
It's your bad luck you missed him.
That's the trouble with you sodbusters,

16
00:03:45,965 --> 00:03:48,023
you can't shoot straight.

17
00:03:50,434 --> 00:03:51,559
Shad,

18
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:56,232
may the Lord have mercy on your soul. Hey!

19
00:04:08,308 --> 00:04:10,331
Buck, I want to see you.

20
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,169
Well, how's the hanging, there?

21
00:04:26,348 --> 00:04:28,439
Well, his neck
didn't hardly stretch a foot.

22
00:04:35,718 --> 00:04:38,378
Here's to the greatest woman in the world,

23
00:04:38,452 --> 00:04:41,783
the fairest flower that ever bloomed,

24
00:04:41,854 --> 00:04:43,878
- Lily Langtry.
- Miss Langtry.

25
00:04:43,955 --> 00:04:45,649
Hold it, boys.

26
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,147
Did you hear the toast, stranger?

27
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,986
To Lily Langtry? I thought
you meant your friends.

28
00:04:53,058 --> 00:04:54,752
I didn't know that included me.

29
00:04:54,825 --> 00:04:57,553
That includes every man
that drinks at my bar.

30
00:04:57,626 --> 00:05:01,924
Glad to join you. Have
you ever met Miss Langtry?

31
00:05:02,028 --> 00:05:06,121
No, I never met her. I never met the
sun, I never shook hands with the moon,

32
00:05:06,196 --> 00:05:08,186
and I've never been introduced to no clouds.

33
00:05:10,332 --> 00:05:13,663
That's all right. Too bad Lily
Langtry couldn't have heard that.

34
00:05:13,732 --> 00:05:15,097
Did you ever see her?

35
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:18,622
No, I was in England once,
but didn't get around to it.

36
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:22,197
Oh, you was in England once,
and you could have seen her,

37
00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:24,566
- but you never got around to it, eh?
- Yeah.

38
00:05:26,304 --> 00:05:28,168
- Get out of my bar.
- Huh?

39
00:05:28,305 --> 00:05:30,237
Get out of my bar!

40
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,768
- To the Jersey Lily.
Miss Langtry.

41
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,397
Here's how.

42
00:06:07,421 --> 00:06:11,047
All right, Mort, if Shad's
good and cold, you can have him.

43
00:06:19,124 --> 00:06:22,819
$4, that's all he had. I'll make
it up to you on the next one.

44
00:06:52,004 --> 00:06:53,265
Get off.

45
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,637
- What you got there?
- A horse thief, Judge.

46
00:07:10,711 --> 00:07:11,972
Prisoner of the bar.

47
00:07:12,045 --> 00:07:14,409
- Get in there.
Chickenfoot, the law.

48
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,538
Hear ye, hear ye, court
of Vinegarroon is now in session.

49
00:07:17,614 --> 00:07:18,705
What's the charge?

50
00:07:18,781 --> 00:07:21,441
We caught him on Chickenfoot's
horse that was stole last week.

51
00:07:21,515 --> 00:07:24,573
- My horse Pete? Where's he at?
- Right outside.

52
00:07:29,652 --> 00:07:32,585
Well, so it is. Pete.

53
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:36,652
No, Your Honor. I was just
trying to get the lay of the land.

54
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:40,416
- You will, too, at the end of a rope.
Southeast, no anticipating.

55
00:07:40,489 --> 00:07:44,719
Hey, Judge! Judge, that is my old
sabino pony. He's tied right out there.

56
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:49,885
People of Vinegarroon again...
You can use any name you like.

57
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,085
Cole Harden.

58
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,820
What are
you doing in Vinegarroon?

59
00:07:54,995 --> 00:07:59,053
- Oh, just passing through.
- Homesteader?

60
00:08:00,497 --> 00:08:02,623
- No.
Where do you hail from?

61
00:08:03,398 --> 00:08:07,025
- No place in particular.
Where are you heading for?

62
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:10,396
- No place special.
- Oh, saddle bum, huh?

63
00:08:11,202 --> 00:08:14,636
Well, it's all right to live on
a horse if it's your own horse.

64
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,829
Bart, turn loose the prisoner's
hands. Chickenfoot, swear him in.

65
00:08:17,904 --> 00:08:20,336
Do you swear to
tell the truth... So help you?

66
00:08:20,405 --> 00:08:22,065
Take off your hat!

67
00:08:37,778 --> 00:08:40,075
Well, now, I'll tell you, son...

68
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,370
Are you Bean?

69
00:08:41,446 --> 00:08:44,504
- Judge Roy W. Bean.
- My name's Jane Ellen Mathews.

70
00:08:44,581 --> 00:08:47,310
Yes, Miss Mathews, what can I do for you?

71
00:08:47,381 --> 00:08:50,315
- What have you done with Shad Wilkins?
- Shad Wilkins?

72
00:08:50,383 --> 00:08:51,382
He was working in the fields

73
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:54,110
when some of your wranglers
came up and took him away.

74
00:08:54,184 --> 00:08:58,380
Shad Wilkins. Shad Wilkins.

75
00:08:59,487 --> 00:09:04,615
Oh, yeah, he was hanging around out there
a while back, but he ain't around now.

76
00:09:04,922 --> 00:09:07,684
Your men not only took him away,
but they tore down the fence.

77
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,518
Not a stick of it was left standing.

78
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:10,614
That so?

79
00:09:10,691 --> 00:09:13,624
Yes, that's so, and you needn't
pretend you don't know about it.

80
00:09:13,692 --> 00:09:15,784
Well, it don't surprise me none.

81
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,724
It's against the law to
build fences hereabouts.

82
00:09:17,794 --> 00:09:20,317
- What law? Whose law?
- Mine.

83
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:23,259
- Now, you listen to me, Mr. Bean.
- Judge Bean.

84
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:27,127
You're no more a judge than I
am. Just call yourself a judge.

85
00:09:27,264 --> 00:09:30,754
I wouldn't say that if I was you. I
might consider it contempt of court.

86
00:09:30,832 --> 00:09:33,765
It's contempt, all right.
You call this a court?

87
00:09:34,334 --> 00:09:37,267
I do, and it happens to
be in session right now.

88
00:09:37,335 --> 00:09:39,801
Southeast, get the young lady a chair.

89
00:09:39,869 --> 00:09:43,701
Now, you sit down, Miss Mathews, and
I'll tend to your case in a minute.

90
00:09:44,871 --> 00:09:47,634
You're charged with stealing
a horse. Guilty or not guilty?

91
00:09:47,705 --> 00:09:49,172
Not guilty.

92
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,263
Where's exhibit A?
- Huh?

93
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,239
Where's the horse? Bring
in the horse, Chickenfoot.

94
00:09:53,307 --> 00:09:55,604
Oh, yeah. Yeah, horse.

95
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:59,805
Miss Mathews, when cattle
can't get to water, they die.

96
00:09:59,877 --> 00:10:01,776
There's miles of river on
each side of our homestead.

97
00:10:01,844 --> 00:10:05,902
This country's unfenced rangeland.
It always was, and always will be.

98
00:10:05,979 --> 00:10:09,037
Get in there. All
right, give me room there, you guys.

99
00:10:09,113 --> 00:10:10,636
Come on, get in there.

100
00:10:10,714 --> 00:10:13,238
Whoa, Pete. Come on in here.

101
00:10:13,915 --> 00:10:16,246
Come on, get over there.
Give us a little room.

102
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:18,839
All right, Judge, there he is.

103
00:10:19,751 --> 00:10:22,149
Mr. Harden, it's my duty to inform you

104
00:10:22,218 --> 00:10:26,448
that the larceny of an equine is a
capital offense, punishable by death,

105
00:10:27,254 --> 00:10:28,914
but you can rest assured that, in this court,

106
00:10:28,988 --> 00:10:32,513
a horse thief always gets a
fair trial before he's hung.

107
00:10:34,056 --> 00:10:37,319
- Chickenfoot, that's your horse?
- Oh, why, Judge...

108
00:10:37,391 --> 00:10:38,948
Can you prove it's your horse?

109
00:10:39,025 --> 00:10:43,823
Why, Judge, anybody here... I can prove
it by Pete himself that he's my horse.

110
00:10:44,628 --> 00:10:47,094
Pete, you're my horse, ain't you?

111
00:10:47,795 --> 00:10:51,421
Ownership of horse clearly
established. It belongs to Chickenfoot.

112
00:10:51,496 --> 00:10:53,190
That's my ruling.

113
00:10:53,831 --> 00:10:56,025
Well, I don't contest it, Your
Honor. Maybe the horse does belong

114
00:10:56,099 --> 00:10:58,998
to Chickenfoot here, but I didn't steal it.

115
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:00,794
- How'd you get it then?
- I bought it.

116
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:03,695
Order in the court!

117
00:11:04,202 --> 00:11:06,964
- That all you got to say?
- That's all.

118
00:11:07,036 --> 00:11:09,798
No, it's not. I'm not going to stay here
and see anybody railroaded like this.

119
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,803
Miss Mathews, I don't recollect you
was summoned as a witness in this trial.

120
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:14,360
What kind of a trial is it when a prisoner

121
00:11:14,438 --> 00:11:16,132
isn't even allowed to
have anybody speak for him?

122
00:11:16,206 --> 00:11:17,230
You an attorney, Miss?

123
00:11:17,307 --> 00:11:19,330
I'm as much an attorney as you are a judge.

124
00:11:19,407 --> 00:11:20,737
- You know this man?
- No, I don't.

125
00:11:20,807 --> 00:11:22,035
- You ever see him before?
- No, but...

126
00:11:22,109 --> 00:11:23,700
- Can you prove he didn't steal the horse?
- No.

127
00:11:23,776 --> 00:11:26,470
Then he don't need no lawyer then.
This man was caught on a stolen horse,

128
00:11:26,544 --> 00:11:28,306
and in this jurisdiction,
that's prima facie evidence.

129
00:11:28,378 --> 00:11:32,812
- The case is closed and that's my ruling.
- Yes, and it's just like all your rulings!

130
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,808
The courtroom will now
be cleared of everybody,

131
00:11:37,881 --> 00:11:41,905
excepting the judge, the jury,
the prisoner, the witnesses and...

132
00:11:43,017 --> 00:11:44,040
I guess that means you.

133
00:11:44,117 --> 00:11:47,312
All right, I'll go. I
don't want to see anymore.

134
00:11:47,985 --> 00:11:50,417
It's murder, that's what it is. Murder.

135
00:11:50,486 --> 00:11:52,578
This man hasn't got a
chance, and you know it,

136
00:11:52,654 --> 00:11:54,416
but you never give anybody a chance.

137
00:11:54,488 --> 00:11:57,717
You didn't give us one when you
stampeded the cattle over our crops.

138
00:11:57,789 --> 00:12:00,483
You thought you'd starve the
homesteaders out, but you didn't.

139
00:12:00,557 --> 00:12:03,752
You can pester us and rob us and
kill us, but you can't stop us.

140
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:06,382
'Cause there'll always be
more coming. More and more.

141
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:11,415
And we'll stay on our farms in spite of
you, and your courtroom and your killers!

142
00:12:12,361 --> 00:12:15,328
By gobs, she's all right.
She'd make a good cattleman.

143
00:12:15,396 --> 00:12:17,919
If it wasn't for Lily, I'd marry her.

144
00:12:38,104 --> 00:12:39,103
Giddap.

145
00:12:39,538 --> 00:12:42,028
You heard the case against
the accused, pro and con.

146
00:12:42,173 --> 00:12:45,867
Now I guess maybe you'd better
retire to consider a verdict.

147
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,573
Chickenfoot, you'd better take
Pete out for a little fresh air.

148
00:12:51,643 --> 00:12:54,166
Take him out, Bart. I got work to do.

149
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:05,210
And while you retire, there'll be
a recess for them that's thirsty.

150
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,248
Well, I guess you can't take it with you.

151
00:13:15,118 --> 00:13:16,516
It's got to be strictly understood

152
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:20,076
you ain't making no effort to influence
the sober judgment of the jury.

153
00:13:20,154 --> 00:13:22,678
- Certainly not.
- There you are.

154
00:13:23,188 --> 00:13:26,587
- Compliments of the prisoner.
- Jury to the rear!

155
00:13:32,858 --> 00:13:34,189
Bull's-eye.

156
00:13:40,928 --> 00:13:43,794
- Join me, Your Honor?
- Don't mind if I do.

157
00:13:45,997 --> 00:13:49,988
Don't spill none of that liquor,
son. It eats right into the bar.

158
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:10,602
To the unfortunate lady
with the bullet in her face.

159
00:14:11,574 --> 00:14:14,939
The man that fired that bullet
was hauled out of here feet first.

160
00:14:15,508 --> 00:14:16,566
And he ought to be.

161
00:14:16,643 --> 00:14:19,735
Any man that'd shoot at a picture
of Lily Langtry ought to be killed.

162
00:14:19,811 --> 00:14:21,004
It's just retribution.

163
00:14:21,078 --> 00:14:24,409
It's justifiable homicide,
that was my ruling.

164
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:25,638
Right.

165
00:14:30,514 --> 00:14:32,674
You an admirer of Miss Lily's, too?

166
00:14:33,282 --> 00:14:35,909
Well, that's putting it mildly.

167
00:14:38,351 --> 00:14:41,183
She's the most beautiful woman I ever met.

168
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,777
Met?

169
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:49,513
You mean to tell me you met Lily
Langtry, the real her, in the flesh?

170
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,111
Oh, many times.

171
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,216
What an actress.

172
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,982
How'd you get to know her?

173
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:03,349
Well, that's a long story, Judge.

174
00:15:05,528 --> 00:15:08,552
Bart, you and Blackjack
get yourself a drink, huh?

175
00:15:11,297 --> 00:15:13,389
Mighty fine liquor. What do you call it?

176
00:15:13,465 --> 00:15:16,796
- Rub of the brush. Go on.
- Rub of the brush?

177
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:20,423
- Did you get to know her real well?
- It's got character.

178
00:15:24,469 --> 00:15:27,265
I said, did you get to know her real well?

179
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:34,434
Now, Judge, you forget a gentleman
never discusses a lady in a barroom.

180
00:15:34,506 --> 00:15:37,496
Who said it's a barroom? This is a courtroom.

181
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:42,670
Say, tell me, is she as
pretty as them pictures?

182
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,400
Why, the picture's never been made
that can do justice to Lily Langtry.

183
00:15:48,478 --> 00:15:50,206
Is she good-natured?

184
00:15:52,947 --> 00:15:54,345
An angel.

185
00:15:59,182 --> 00:16:02,343
- I'll never forget the night we met.
- Yeah?

186
00:16:05,485 --> 00:16:08,179
I'll never forget it as long as I live.

187
00:16:29,127 --> 00:16:30,127
Who was that?

188
00:16:30,194 --> 00:16:33,252
Oh, that's Mort Borrow.
He cleans up around here.

189
00:16:33,663 --> 00:16:35,289
Go on about Lily.

190
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:40,864
Oh, yeah, Lily.

191
00:16:48,235 --> 00:16:49,531
How about a verdict?

192
00:16:49,602 --> 00:16:52,660
Can't you see we're still
considering the evidence?

193
00:16:53,803 --> 00:16:56,770
Two aces. COWBOY
Bet a dollar and a half.

194
00:16:56,837 --> 00:16:58,236
Stay once.

195
00:16:59,105 --> 00:17:02,004
Get away from here. You
smell of formaldehyde!

196
00:17:02,073 --> 00:17:03,630
I'll call that.

197
00:17:04,408 --> 00:17:05,965
You been down around Lanno Bay, ain't you?

198
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:07,372
Sure.

199
00:17:07,442 --> 00:17:10,375
Well, you know how it is at sunset.

200
00:17:11,443 --> 00:17:16,275
You can look out and that water ain't
exactly blue, and it ain't exactly purple.

201
00:17:17,012 --> 00:17:20,969
It's a kind of color a man can
feel, but he can't put a name to.

202
00:17:21,048 --> 00:17:22,139
Yeah.

203
00:17:24,282 --> 00:17:26,305
Well, that's Lily's eyes.

204
00:17:28,717 --> 00:17:29,978
By gobs!

205
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,478
I'm out. COWBOY
I'll stay out. Here we go.

206
00:17:40,488 --> 00:17:43,011
Got 10. Got a nine.

207
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:47,887
You know how bright and
coppery and gold-like

208
00:17:47,957 --> 00:17:50,890
a young chestnut horse is
running in the bright sun?

209
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:54,915
- Yeah.
- Well, her hair is something like that.

210
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:59,184
In the daytime.

211
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:01,895
You mean it's different at night?

212
00:18:01,962 --> 00:18:05,361
Well, not different,
but just sort of more so.

213
00:18:05,831 --> 00:18:08,696
- How so?
- Well...

214
00:18:09,866 --> 00:18:14,823
Well, you know how it is at dusk when you
see a prairie fire reflected in the sky.

215
00:18:15,802 --> 00:18:21,430
A sort of a deep... A
beautiful kind of blushing...

216
00:18:21,904 --> 00:18:23,564
- Red?
- Red.

217
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:29,732
- Well, that'll give you a rough idea.
- By gobs.

218
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:37,035
I got a lock of her hair.

219
00:18:40,678 --> 00:18:44,543
You mean to tell me you actually
got the real... From her head?

220
00:18:50,482 --> 00:18:53,108
I don't suppose you'd ever
part with that lock of hair,

221
00:18:53,183 --> 00:18:55,911
no matter what a man was willing to give?

222
00:18:57,584 --> 00:19:00,074
A man don't trade things like that.

223
00:19:04,053 --> 00:19:06,179
You see that sword up there?

224
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:10,382
I wore it in the civil war.
Always meant to be buried with it.

225
00:19:10,456 --> 00:19:12,753
Now, if you was willing to swap, why...

226
00:19:14,691 --> 00:19:16,521
Would you really like to have it?

227
00:19:16,592 --> 00:19:20,719
I'd rather own it than the state
of Texas. Let's have a look at it.

228
00:19:23,427 --> 00:19:25,417
I haven't got it with me.

229
00:19:28,696 --> 00:19:30,185
Where's it at?

230
00:19:31,498 --> 00:19:33,726
It's with my stuff in El Paso.

231
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:37,095
So, you was in the civil war, huh, Judge?

232
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,190
- El Paso, huh?
- Yeah.

233
00:19:40,735 --> 00:19:43,896
- Cavalry, huh?
- I suppose you could write for it.

234
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:47,933
Yeah.

235
00:19:48,003 --> 00:19:50,937
Wouldn't take long to get here by mail coach.

236
00:19:51,305 --> 00:19:53,135
Oh, two, three weeks.

237
00:19:55,273 --> 00:19:57,637
- Two or three weeks, huh?
- Yeah, about.

238
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:20,445
But I wouldn't part with that lock
of hair for anything in the world.

239
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,453
The jury's ready, Judge.

240
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,548
That bottle
of whiskey gone already?

241
00:20:33,621 --> 00:20:37,749
Yeah, and if he ain't paid for it,
you better start collecting now.

242
00:20:50,128 --> 00:20:53,721
- What's the verdict?
- You know what the verdict is. Guilty.

243
00:20:59,698 --> 00:21:02,029
There's only one thing I can do.

244
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:04,827
You're sentenced to hang, that's my ruling.

245
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,298
Turn loose the prisoner's hands.

246
00:21:06,367 --> 00:21:09,892
- But, Judge, you just ruled...
- I didn't finish my ruling.

247
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:15,132
The court sentenced the prisoner to hang,

248
00:21:15,705 --> 00:21:18,831
but the court didn't say when. So
long as there's reasonable doubt...

249
00:21:18,906 --> 00:21:20,600
What reasonable doubt, Judge?

250
00:21:20,673 --> 00:21:22,367
We just caught him with Chickenfoot's horse.

251
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,737
- Ain't any room for doubt.
- Order!

252
00:21:27,009 --> 00:21:31,033
I been talking to the prisoner.
He's a friend of Lily Langtry's.

253
00:21:32,078 --> 00:21:36,273
Stands to reason no friend of Lily
Langtry goes around stealing horses.

254
00:21:36,346 --> 00:21:38,142
Leastways, there's a reasonable doubt.

255
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,305
You mean, you're setting
aside your own ruling?

256
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,439
That ain't what I said. When
I make a ruling, it stands.

257
00:21:43,516 --> 00:21:45,142
But, Judge, you just sentenced the man.

258
00:21:45,216 --> 00:21:47,045
His sentence is suspended

259
00:21:47,116 --> 00:21:49,743
for a couple weeks until I can
look into the matter further.

260
00:21:49,818 --> 00:21:51,444
That's my ruling.

261
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:09,250
- Hi, Mort. How's business?
- Just lost a customer.

262
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:11,185
Well, I'll be down for a shave in a minute.

263
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,158
All right, you're next.

264
00:22:23,597 --> 00:22:25,860
- Howdy, Judge.
- Hello, Evans.

265
00:22:25,932 --> 00:22:27,693
Jersey Lily special.

266
00:22:41,704 --> 00:22:45,331
Pardon me, you don't happen
to have a twin brother, do you?

267
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:46,997
No, not me.

268
00:22:48,073 --> 00:22:51,165
Well, you'd better pay
me that money you owe me.

269
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:54,171
<i>You're loco, brother.
I don't owe you nothing.</i>

270
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:55,765
You owe me $60.

271
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:02,170
$60.

272
00:23:56,834 --> 00:23:59,926
If you're interested, that's the
man that sold me the roan horse.

273
00:24:00,001 --> 00:24:02,297
Then, he's the man that stole...

274
00:24:43,818 --> 00:24:46,217
$84 and 6 bits.

275
00:24:54,889 --> 00:24:56,788
Fined $80 for disorderly conduct,

276
00:24:56,857 --> 00:25:00,018
and $4 and 6 bits for
carrying concealed weapons.

277
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:03,152
Now, you men get some rope and string him up.

278
00:25:03,226 --> 00:25:05,853
String him up? Why, he's dead already.

279
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,318
We hang horse thieves,
don't we? String him up!

280
00:25:10,362 --> 00:25:12,090
Come inside, son.

281
00:25:17,898 --> 00:25:20,331
You can have his horse and outfit.

282
00:25:28,102 --> 00:25:30,625
- Rub of the brush?
- Rub of the brush.

283
00:25:36,572 --> 00:25:38,868
- El Paso.
- El Paso.

284
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:49,465
Good morning, Judge.

285
00:29:50,403 --> 00:29:51,835
Who are you?

286
00:29:55,872 --> 00:29:58,862
Who are you? What are you doing here?

287
00:30:05,676 --> 00:30:07,938
Stranger. Stranger, come here.

288
00:30:09,677 --> 00:30:12,644
Straighten out my neck, would
you? Grab a hold of my head.

289
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:14,872
Now, jerk it quick.

290
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:19,510
Thank you. It's my neck.

291
00:30:21,482 --> 00:30:25,246
You see I was hung once, but
my friends cut me down in time.

292
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:29,548
Now when I don't live right,
why, the crick comes back on me.

293
00:30:49,326 --> 00:30:52,623
Now, who are you, anyhow?
And what are you doing here?

294
00:30:53,995 --> 00:30:56,087
Why, don't you remember?

295
00:30:56,628 --> 00:30:58,891
Why, I'm the fellow that
filled the inside straight,

296
00:30:58,963 --> 00:31:00,759
and won Chickenfoot's horse.

297
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:05,656
So long, Judge.

298
00:31:15,536 --> 00:31:18,901
Hey, Pete, are you glad I
won you from Chickenfoot?

299
00:31:19,271 --> 00:31:21,260
Well, that makes it nice.

300
00:31:21,872 --> 00:31:22,871
Here.

301
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:17,413
Wait!

302
00:33:18,483 --> 00:33:19,882
Wait!

303
00:34:09,103 --> 00:34:11,400
That lock of hair, Lily's hair,

304
00:34:13,772 --> 00:34:18,706
you promised to write to El Paso for
it. Don't you remember? We drank on it.

305
00:34:19,707 --> 00:34:21,833
When are you going to do it?

306
00:34:28,378 --> 00:34:29,377
Huh?

307
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,806
- You ain't going to crawfish?
- No, the first post office I come to.

308
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,279
Straighten her out, would you, son?

309
00:34:42,116 --> 00:34:43,480
Thank you.

310
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:56,779
You mangy old scorpion, you
might have got us both killed.

311
00:35:09,326 --> 00:35:13,055
- What you want to go to California for?
- See the Pacific Ocean.

312
00:35:13,128 --> 00:35:15,924
It's just like the gulf down at Lanno Bay.

313
00:35:16,262 --> 00:35:17,626
It's bigger.

314
00:35:18,864 --> 00:35:21,695
Why don't you stay around Vinegarroon awhile?

315
00:35:21,798 --> 00:35:25,596
We could have a lot of fun together.
We could talk about Lily and...

316
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:28,429
No, I'm on my way.

317
00:35:30,168 --> 00:35:31,361
Listen,

318
00:35:33,236 --> 00:35:36,294
it's a great country here, west of the Pecos.

319
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:38,996
A fellow could really
make something of himself.

320
00:35:39,071 --> 00:35:41,868
Why, when I first come
here, I didn't have nothing.

321
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:44,429
Now, I'm boss of the whole section.

322
00:35:45,141 --> 00:35:47,767
Well, that's mighty fine, Judge.

323
00:35:48,842 --> 00:35:51,809
You know, I cottoned to you
the first time I seen you.

324
00:35:51,876 --> 00:35:53,900
Why don't you put in with me?

325
00:35:53,977 --> 00:35:57,206
Well, I tell you, Judge,
it's nice of you to ask me,

326
00:35:57,278 --> 00:36:03,304
but I'm heading for California, and
nothing short of hanging can stop me.

327
00:36:04,881 --> 00:36:09,077
Wait a minute. You can't go.
You're under suspended sentence.

328
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,309
- Why, you hung Mr. Evans for that.
- Huh?

329
00:36:11,383 --> 00:36:13,373
You're under suspendence, anyhow.

330
00:36:13,451 --> 00:36:16,577
Who are you? What do I know about you?
How do I know they ain't looking for you?

331
00:36:16,652 --> 00:36:21,416
You're under arrest for disorderly
conduct, for disturbing the peace, vagrancy,

332
00:36:21,488 --> 00:36:24,751
and you're on the way back to
town with me, and that's my ruling!

333
00:36:24,822 --> 00:36:26,345
So long, Judge.

334
00:36:48,132 --> 00:36:50,122
By gobs, he stole my gun.

335
00:36:59,903 --> 00:37:02,529
We hired out for farm
work, Miss, not a civil war.

336
00:37:02,604 --> 00:37:04,571
This ain't no fit place to homestead in.

337
00:37:04,638 --> 00:37:06,662
Land's no good when there's
always lead flying over it.

338
00:37:06,738 --> 00:37:08,500
If you'd shoot back, maybe
they'd stop bothering you.

339
00:37:08,572 --> 00:37:09,664
We did shoot back.

340
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,935
And so did Shad Wilkins, and
he ain't trying it no more.

341
00:37:13,008 --> 00:37:14,906
What about your own quarter section?

342
00:37:14,975 --> 00:37:17,534
- If you leave, you'll lose it.
- We don't want no part of it.

343
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,304
All right, Hod. If you feel that way,

344
00:37:19,377 --> 00:37:21,900
we'll try to get along
with just Eph and Henry.

345
00:37:21,978 --> 00:37:23,171
Not me.

346
00:37:25,246 --> 00:37:29,374
Henry, if we only had one
man, it'd be a big help.

347
00:37:29,448 --> 00:37:31,175
Sorry, Mr. Mathews.

348
00:37:40,252 --> 00:37:42,048
Call themselves men.

349
00:37:50,089 --> 00:37:52,181
Wade, what do we do?

350
00:37:57,225 --> 00:38:01,784
- I know what to do.
- No, no, wait. That's not the way.

351
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,724
Don't even think of it.

352
00:38:05,561 --> 00:38:08,461
Wade, aren't you going to stay for supper?

353
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,362
I'll be back.

354
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:26,460
Well, they left.

355
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:28,435
Of course they have. What did you expect?

356
00:38:28,503 --> 00:38:30,333
My hands quit, too. You
can't blame them for leaving.

357
00:38:30,404 --> 00:38:32,394
There won't be a hired man
left in this part of the country

358
00:38:32,472 --> 00:38:33,904
if we don't do something about it.

359
00:38:33,972 --> 00:38:36,303
We hire new hands, same thing will happen.

360
00:38:36,374 --> 00:38:38,272
What's old Mathews going to say about it?

361
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,307
He keeps passing the
buck to the Lord Jehovah.

362
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:43,308
I say, let's do something about it ourselves.

363
00:38:43,376 --> 00:38:45,206
- That's right.
- That's what I like to hear.

364
00:38:45,277 --> 00:38:47,676
Let's give the judge the same
thing he gave Shad Wilkins.

365
00:38:48,211 --> 00:38:52,202
Maybe if some of us went down and
appealed to Roy Bean for justice...

366
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:56,441
Justice. If you'd seen him yesterday,
pretending to try that prisoner...

367
00:38:56,514 --> 00:38:58,174
The man didn't have a chance.

368
00:38:58,248 --> 00:39:01,272
- I wonder if they hanged him.
- Don't they always?

369
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:04,282
He was the same as dead
even while he stood there.

370
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:06,943
I've kept on seeing his face all day.

371
00:39:15,189 --> 00:39:16,485
What is it, Daughter?

372
00:39:16,556 --> 00:39:20,115
The man I told you about,
the one that was hanged.

373
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:23,249
I saw him plain as day,
looking in the window.

374
00:39:27,059 --> 00:39:30,254
You're seeing things, Jane
Ellen. There's nobody out there.

375
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,486
I saw his face, I tell you.

376
00:39:36,896 --> 00:39:38,453
Come in.

377
00:39:40,398 --> 00:39:41,887
Good evening.

378
00:39:50,569 --> 00:39:52,399
Pardon me for intruding like this.

379
00:39:52,469 --> 00:39:57,960
Oh, no, you're not. It's
just... Well, I thought you were a ghost.

380
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:02,437
Well, I guess you're partly to blame I'm not.

381
00:40:02,507 --> 00:40:06,463
- I just stopped in to thank you.
- Father, this is Mister...

382
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:10,031
- Harden.
- Welcome, Mr. Harden, welcome.

383
00:40:10,443 --> 00:40:12,069
Glad to meet you.

384
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:17,306
Oh, Mr. Harden, this is
our neighbor Wade Harper.

385
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:19,876
This is the man I told you about.

386
00:40:19,947 --> 00:40:22,812
You mean to tell me Bean
tried you, and let you go?

387
00:40:22,881 --> 00:40:25,780
Well, she was my lawyer. I guess
she's the one that got me off.

388
00:40:25,848 --> 00:40:28,179
- I knew you weren't a horse thief.
- Thanks.

389
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,414
How did you know that?

390
00:40:32,985 --> 00:40:34,508
I just knew.

391
00:40:35,053 --> 00:40:37,043
Are you working anywhere?

392
00:40:38,454 --> 00:40:41,910
No, I'm heading for California.

393
00:40:42,622 --> 00:40:48,182
Mr. Harden, I suppose a body that's just
been hanged is apt to be a bit hungry.

394
00:40:48,258 --> 00:40:50,247
You must stay for supper.

395
00:40:54,093 --> 00:40:57,219
- Well, I don't want to put you out any.
- Oh, no, not at all.

396
00:40:57,294 --> 00:41:00,318
Matter of fact, we had some
company that just disappointed us.

397
00:41:00,395 --> 00:41:03,794
Uh-huh. We were hoping somebody'd
show up to take their place.

398
00:41:03,863 --> 00:41:07,092
Make yourself at home,
now. Make yourself at home.

399
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,729
Wait till you sink your teeth
into some of Jane Ellen's stew.

400
00:41:23,905 --> 00:41:29,067
Oh, Lord, for that which
thou hast sent us in our hour of need,

401
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,031
make us truly grateful.

402
00:41:32,475 --> 00:41:37,307
Bless this food to our use and
ourselves to thy service. Amen.

403
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,801
Let me help you.

404
00:41:42,312 --> 00:41:43,335
How about some hominy?

405
00:41:43,412 --> 00:41:45,072
- Here, Wade. Give him some milk.
- All right, all right.

406
00:41:45,146 --> 00:41:46,908
Give him some milk.

407
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:51,879
I think he likes it here. I think we got him.

408
00:41:51,949 --> 00:41:54,381
- What's he doing now?
- Feeding his horse.

409
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:59,214
Wade, he could probably take the place
of two men. He's so big and strong.

410
00:41:59,285 --> 00:42:02,684
- Well, I don't know how strong he is.
- Strong enough, Wade.

411
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:05,379
Now, Jane Ellen, we'll
leave you alone with him,

412
00:42:05,454 --> 00:42:07,683
and you kind of add on a little more welcome.

413
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:10,347
- What'll I say?
- Oh, just keep smiling at him.

414
00:42:10,422 --> 00:42:15,152
And, Daughter, if it should come up natural
- like,

415
00:42:15,224 --> 00:42:18,521
you might hint what a handsome man he is.

416
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:20,386
Handsome?

417
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:24,656
We need him terribly bad, Daughter.
We got to get that corn husked.

418
00:42:24,794 --> 00:42:26,693
We need him terribly bad.

419
00:42:26,762 --> 00:42:29,127
- Listen, your father don't mean for you to...
- Shh.

420
00:42:29,197 --> 00:42:30,493
Look out.

421
00:42:32,531 --> 00:42:34,395
Everything all right, Mr. Harden?

422
00:42:34,466 --> 00:42:37,262
- Fine, thanks.
- Good. Now, I'll go see about your bunk.

423
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:40,129
- Oh, don't trouble.
- No trouble at all. Come on, Wade.

424
00:42:53,706 --> 00:42:55,570
- Can I give you a hand?
- Oh, no, thanks.

425
00:42:56,274 --> 00:42:59,969
- Won't you sit down, please?
- Well, I won't argue with you.

426
00:43:00,609 --> 00:43:03,576
If I had to wash dishes,
I guess I'd give up eating.

427
00:43:03,644 --> 00:43:06,270
Well, what do you do about
the dishes when you're home?

428
00:43:06,344 --> 00:43:08,504
Home? What? You mean in a house?

429
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:10,777
Well, you live in a house, don't you?

430
00:43:10,946 --> 00:43:16,313
No. No, my house is all out there,
all one room with a sky for a roof.

431
00:43:17,482 --> 00:43:21,314
- Well, it's a big place.
- Got some space to rent.

432
00:43:23,318 --> 00:43:26,376
Well, I guess California's
your next stop, huh?

433
00:43:26,486 --> 00:43:31,852
California, but I don't
stop. Oregon next, I guess.

434
00:43:32,087 --> 00:43:35,145
Well, all places aren't just the same.

435
00:43:35,289 --> 00:43:38,814
Wouldn't you rather stay a
little longer in some places?

436
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:41,618
No, they're all the same,
beautiful when you leave them.

437
00:43:41,991 --> 00:43:45,356
Well, it's like the turtles.
Carry their houses with them.

438
00:43:45,426 --> 00:43:47,825
If I had to build me a
house, I'd have it on wheels.

439
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:52,786
Not me. I'd want my house so
that nothing could ever move it.

440
00:43:53,329 --> 00:43:56,125
So down deep that an
earthquake couldn't shake it,

441
00:43:56,864 --> 00:43:59,888
and a cyclone would be
just another wind going by.

442
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:06,224
Well, you say, "Who wants to be a turtle?"

443
00:44:07,035 --> 00:44:10,763
And I say, "I hope you'll
be very happy in your house. "

444
00:44:20,106 --> 00:44:24,369
- Well...
- Oh, say, wait a minute.

445
00:44:24,441 --> 00:44:25,771
What?

446
00:44:25,841 --> 00:44:28,206
I'll bet I know something we could agree on.

447
00:44:28,276 --> 00:44:29,367
What's that?

448
00:44:29,443 --> 00:44:32,376
Well, in about a week now,
we're going to husk the corn,

449
00:44:33,111 --> 00:44:35,169
and I'll bet you'll agree that that's fun.

450
00:44:36,313 --> 00:44:39,508
Well, you know, I think husking
corn's the greatest fun in the world.

451
00:44:40,314 --> 00:44:42,838
- Husking corn, fun?
- Oh, yes!

452
00:44:44,282 --> 00:44:47,943
- Well, I'd rather wash dishes.
- Oh, no.

453
00:44:49,984 --> 00:44:54,248
It was a fine supper, and good cooking.

454
00:44:57,587 --> 00:44:59,144
Oh, Mr. Harden.

455
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:08,553
What a handsome man you are.

456
00:45:14,261 --> 00:45:16,227
I doubt that, but I'm a tired one.

457
00:45:16,294 --> 00:45:19,659
Well, I hope I see you in
the morning before I leave.

458
00:45:27,032 --> 00:45:29,191
Get out of here! Hey!

459
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:43,394
If anybody'd told me yesterday
I'd be playing tag in a cornfield

460
00:45:43,472 --> 00:45:45,461
with a lot of cows...

461
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:48,102
If we had some men that would ride fence,

462
00:45:48,174 --> 00:45:51,073
there wouldn't be any cows in the cornfield.

463
00:45:53,675 --> 00:45:55,869
You were sure cute last night.

464
00:45:57,277 --> 00:45:58,675
Now you're making fun of me.

465
00:45:58,744 --> 00:46:02,337
Well, that's... That's
more fun than picking corn.

466
00:46:08,614 --> 00:46:11,445
Hey, look at your father. I wonder what's up.

467
00:46:19,252 --> 00:46:21,810
I tried to stop them.
They wouldn't listen to me.

468
00:46:21,886 --> 00:46:22,885
Wade!

469
00:46:22,953 --> 00:46:25,512
Yes, yes. It's the wrong
and lawless thing to do.

470
00:46:25,588 --> 00:46:29,249
- I begged them not to. I told them.
- Who? What happened?

471
00:46:29,323 --> 00:46:31,653
Wade Harper has rounded up some of the men.

472
00:46:31,724 --> 00:46:33,884
They going to town to lynch Judge Bean.

473
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:35,788
- When did they leave?
- About an hour ago.

474
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:37,189
They took our wagon.

475
00:47:34,614 --> 00:47:37,013
Thunder and lightning! You
back from California already?

476
00:47:37,082 --> 00:47:38,878
You got to get out of here,
and don't stop for nothing.

477
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:39,949
Did you write to El Paso?

478
00:47:40,016 --> 00:47:42,313
Listen, just get on your horse
and get, because they're after you.

479
00:47:42,385 --> 00:47:44,977
Did you write? Who's after me?

480
00:47:45,152 --> 00:47:47,278
The homesteaders. They're
going to string you up.

481
00:47:47,853 --> 00:47:49,615
Why, that bunch of plow-pushing sod!

482
00:47:49,687 --> 00:47:52,154
They're outside right now,
a whole wagonload of them.

483
00:47:52,222 --> 00:47:55,417
A wagonload? Why, I can
handle a train load of them.

484
00:47:55,822 --> 00:47:57,880
I'll tear their livers out.

485
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:23,363
What'll it be, gentlemen?

486
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:26,460
It'll be Roy Bean. Where is he?

487
00:48:28,102 --> 00:48:29,830
He's out for a while.

488
00:48:31,237 --> 00:48:34,398
That's because you came
down here and warned him.

489
00:48:48,276 --> 00:48:50,436
Make a move and I'll kill you.

490
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:56,103
Cole, start collecting them shotguns,

491
00:48:58,514 --> 00:49:01,913
uncork them rifles now and set
them down this end of the bar,

492
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:02,981
easy-like.

493
00:49:04,616 --> 00:49:06,242
Go on.

494
00:49:12,819 --> 00:49:15,945
Get back. Get back.

495
00:49:33,394 --> 00:49:35,485
Now, I'll take yours, Judge.

496
00:50:19,078 --> 00:50:20,476
The drinks are on me, gentlemen.

497
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,808
We're not drinking with
you, Harden, nor him, either.

498
00:50:28,282 --> 00:50:31,443
I ain't serving none of my liquor
to no bunch of tomato-kissing,

499
00:50:31,516 --> 00:50:33,813
- plow-pushing...
- Now, Judge,

500
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:37,515
we don't want any harsh words to spoil
this friendly little get-together.

501
00:50:37,585 --> 00:50:38,779
Get-together?

502
00:50:39,653 --> 00:50:43,246
Why, this pack of weasels invade
the dignity of my courtroom,

503
00:50:44,021 --> 00:50:47,386
come in here armed with malice
aforethought to kick up a rumpus...

504
00:50:47,556 --> 00:50:52,013
Now, look, you being a judge, you know
there's always two sides to any question.

505
00:50:52,691 --> 00:50:54,783
These men have come here
with a legitimate grievance.

506
00:50:54,859 --> 00:50:57,052
We're not asking you to speak for us, Harden.

507
00:50:57,193 --> 00:50:58,353
No, nor me, either.

508
00:50:59,727 --> 00:51:02,888
Well, that makes it unanimous. I'm
going to talk for the both of you.

509
00:51:05,129 --> 00:51:06,925
There's a law here against fencing land

510
00:51:06,996 --> 00:51:09,963
that seems nothing short of
murder to people raising crops,

511
00:51:10,331 --> 00:51:12,264
but it's common sense to men running cattle.

512
00:51:14,733 --> 00:51:16,290
I've seen this kind of war before.

513
00:51:16,367 --> 00:51:18,697
It's happening now, back
in Kansas and Nebraska.

514
00:51:19,635 --> 00:51:21,294
The cattlemen came in first,

515
00:51:21,368 --> 00:51:24,097
then the homesteaders moved
in and fenced them out.

516
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:28,399
They had crops for one year,
and then a dry spell, drought,

517
00:51:29,005 --> 00:51:30,232
so the homesteaders moved out,

518
00:51:30,306 --> 00:51:32,738
and the rush and thistle and jimson moved in.

519
00:51:32,806 --> 00:51:35,672
And the big spaces were all broken
up by little quarter sections,

520
00:51:36,741 --> 00:51:37,934
and the homesteads left empty,

521
00:51:38,008 --> 00:51:41,271
and the houses caved in, and the
land, no good for man or cattle.

522
00:51:41,343 --> 00:51:44,139
You spoiled the land, then you
came here to spoil this land.

523
00:51:44,211 --> 00:51:45,610
This here's a big country.

524
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:48,908
Yea, but it ain't big enough for cattlemen
and homesteaders, and it never will be.

525
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:52,276
Now, clear out here. That's my ruling.

526
00:51:55,149 --> 00:51:57,638
All right, Bean, we're going.

527
00:51:58,484 --> 00:52:01,042
We're going back to build our fences.

528
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:05,013
If you do, you better build
coffins along with them. Now, get.

529
00:52:55,706 --> 00:52:57,729
You sure told them off, son.

530
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,670
Yep, and now I'm going to tell you off.

531
00:53:00,741 --> 00:53:03,003
I'm sorry I stopped them from lynching you.

532
00:53:03,075 --> 00:53:05,099
They got a right to defend their homesteads.

533
00:53:05,276 --> 00:53:07,868
You know this ain't homestead
land. You just said so yourself.

534
00:53:07,943 --> 00:53:11,274
- The government didn't say so.
- I'm the government here.

535
00:53:11,345 --> 00:53:14,471
Judas Priest, I don't see how you
can talk up for scum like that.

536
00:53:14,546 --> 00:53:16,672
They proved up on their land,
and they got deeds to it.

537
00:53:16,747 --> 00:53:18,441
When you make war on them, you're making war

538
00:53:18,515 --> 00:53:20,708
on their women and kids, too.

539
00:53:21,249 --> 00:53:22,806
Those people were starved out last year.

540
00:53:22,883 --> 00:53:25,873
I heard about those cattle
being stampeded over their crops,

541
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:28,883
and there's too many strays running
loose in that valley right now,

542
00:53:29,118 --> 00:53:30,914
only they're not strays.

543
00:53:32,486 --> 00:53:34,214
What do you want me to
do? Arrest them cattle,

544
00:53:34,287 --> 00:53:36,719
and fine them a couple
dollars apiece for trespass?

545
00:53:38,189 --> 00:53:39,188
Now, look,

546
00:53:40,089 --> 00:53:44,490
those people don't take up much room with
their little shirt-sized pieces of land.

547
00:53:45,491 --> 00:53:48,322
Why don't you be a real
judge for all of the people?

548
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:53,093
Why don't you try to see their side of
it, and help them instead of fight them?

549
00:53:54,128 --> 00:53:56,754
Make peace around here instead of war.

550
00:53:57,563 --> 00:54:01,758
There's plenty of room for everybody,
then everybody'd look up to you.

551
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:07,530
And then someday, maybe they'd put
up a statue out there in the street,

552
00:54:09,433 --> 00:54:14,390
a statue with a carving on it.
"To Roy Bean, the real judge. "

553
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:19,163
What are you doing? Catching a fish?

554
00:54:20,738 --> 00:54:22,035
I guess I'm wasting my time.

555
00:54:22,106 --> 00:54:24,334
Hold on, wait a minute. You
write that letter to El Paso yet?

556
00:54:24,406 --> 00:54:27,305
- No!
- You promised. We drank on it.

557
00:54:28,408 --> 00:54:30,533
I didn't have to write it.
I had it on me all the time.

558
00:54:30,608 --> 00:54:32,939
You did? Well, why didn't
you give it to me then?

559
00:54:34,143 --> 00:54:37,440
You old bullhead, if I'd have
given it to you, you'd have hung me.

560
00:54:37,511 --> 00:54:39,000
Wouldn't you?

561
00:54:39,279 --> 00:54:42,678
- I might've at that. Let's have a look at it.
- I haven't got it with me.

562
00:54:42,747 --> 00:54:44,737
Suffering, bleeding
Chickamauga! Where's it at?

563
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:47,241
I left it over at the Mathews' place.

564
00:54:47,448 --> 00:54:48,812
- How is she?
- Huh?

565
00:54:48,949 --> 00:54:51,178
- I'll ride right over with you.
- No, no.

566
00:54:52,017 --> 00:54:54,712
You mean you're gonna crawfish?
You ain't going to give it to me?

567
00:54:54,818 --> 00:54:57,046
- Sure, I'll give it to you.
- When?

568
00:54:57,586 --> 00:55:00,280
When the last steer's out of the valley.

569
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,578
All right, I'll pass the
word around to the boys.

570
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:05,315
No, you don't. You're going
to help run those cattle out,

571
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:08,618
and I'm going along with
you to see that it's done.

572
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:10,880
Don't you trust me, Cole?

573
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:13,987
When I was a kid, I had a pet rattlesnake.

574
00:55:14,059 --> 00:55:17,390
I was fond of it, but I
wouldn't turn my back on it.

575
00:55:20,461 --> 00:55:21,825
You're all right.

576
00:55:22,596 --> 00:55:25,757
I'm going back now, and gathering
my stuff for the roundup.

577
00:55:28,164 --> 00:55:31,359
- And that lock of hair.
- Yeah, yeah, the lock of hair.

578
00:55:44,771 --> 00:55:46,431
He defended Bean. He said he was right.

579
00:55:46,805 --> 00:55:49,704
Said the homesteaders spoiled this
land for the cattlemen. We all heard it.

580
00:55:49,773 --> 00:55:51,467
I don't care what you heard.

581
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,302
He couldn't be two-faced.
He's not that kind.

582
00:55:54,241 --> 00:55:56,299
If he took Bean's part, he
only did it to stop trouble.

583
00:55:57,409 --> 00:55:58,875
Miss Mathews,

584
00:56:00,376 --> 00:56:03,242
looks like every time I get into
trouble, you always speak up for me.

585
00:56:03,312 --> 00:56:05,778
They're trying to tell
me you spoke up for Bean.

586
00:56:05,845 --> 00:56:10,108
Well, I did try to tell
them Bean's point of view.

587
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:11,180
There you are.

588
00:56:12,481 --> 00:56:14,641
It's always been my experience

589
00:56:14,716 --> 00:56:18,114
that when you know the other fellow's
point of view, you usually get together.

590
00:56:18,817 --> 00:56:21,284
Well, why didn't you tell
him our point of view?

591
00:56:21,352 --> 00:56:22,750
I did, and we got together.

592
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:27,052
You won't have to patrol
your fields any longer.

593
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,178
Judge gave me his word they'd
round up all cattle in this valley

594
00:56:29,255 --> 00:56:30,346
and take them out of here.

595
00:56:31,522 --> 00:56:33,716
You think he'd keep his word?

596
00:56:34,123 --> 00:56:36,817
Well, I'm going along with
him to see that he does.

597
00:56:36,891 --> 00:56:39,756
Well, what makes you
think we'd take your word?

598
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,353
Take it or leave it.

599
00:56:45,394 --> 00:56:46,724
Harden,

600
00:56:48,262 --> 00:56:50,320
you're a sneak and a liar.

601
00:58:19,864 --> 00:58:21,262
Miss Mathews!

602
00:58:28,201 --> 00:58:29,200
I'll be back.

603
00:58:41,739 --> 00:58:43,569
California's that way.

604
00:58:46,108 --> 00:58:48,370
I got something to tell you before I go.

605
00:58:50,976 --> 00:58:53,272
- Well?
- How's Wade?

606
00:58:54,645 --> 00:58:57,111
He's fine, just fine.

607
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,979
You know, you're not the
prettiest girl I ever saw.

608
00:59:06,415 --> 00:59:08,575
Well, that's great news. Who asked you?

609
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:11,739
But you've got the prettiest hair I ever saw.

610
00:59:14,518 --> 00:59:16,610
Why do you like to make fun of me?

611
00:59:18,987 --> 00:59:20,419
'Cause I like you, I guess.

612
00:59:21,888 --> 00:59:27,118
- And you think my hair's pretty, huh?
- I never saw anything like it.

613
00:59:37,093 --> 00:59:40,583
- Oh, could I clip a lock?
- No, you can't.

614
00:59:41,896 --> 00:59:44,226
- Will you clip one?
- No, I won't.

615
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:48,154
Come around here, take sides with Bean,

616
00:59:49,265 --> 00:59:51,562
and knock out my best friend, and...

617
00:59:51,932 --> 00:59:53,398
Tell you how much I like you,

618
00:59:55,534 --> 00:59:59,161
and how much I might miss you?

619
01:00:20,444 --> 01:00:22,138
- All right?
- No.

620
01:00:33,149 --> 01:00:35,013
Here, these are yours.

621
01:01:18,866 --> 01:01:21,799
Well, thanks a lot.

622
01:02:08,885 --> 01:02:09,885
Jane Ellen!

623
01:02:29,194 --> 01:02:30,854
Go on, Cole. Go on.

624
01:02:32,895 --> 01:02:37,829
Well, so I says to her...
I said, "Miss Langtry,

625
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:41,529
"do you plan to go back to England
when you finish your American tour?"

626
01:02:43,032 --> 01:02:46,023
And she said to me... She said,

627
01:02:47,868 --> 01:02:51,995
"No. " Said she loved the
United States too much.

628
01:02:52,136 --> 01:02:53,659
- Yeah?
- She planned to stay here

629
01:02:53,737 --> 01:02:55,829
for the rest of her life.

630
01:02:57,572 --> 01:03:00,505
She told me that when she got all
through her work in the theater,

631
01:03:00,573 --> 01:03:03,267
that she wanted to settle down
someplace out here in the West.

632
01:03:04,273 --> 01:03:05,501
By gobs.

633
01:03:06,575 --> 01:03:09,508
Some quiet little place way out on the range,

634
01:03:09,576 --> 01:03:12,305
away from all the lights and the crowds.

635
01:03:15,378 --> 01:03:17,810
She kept asking about Texas especially.

636
01:03:21,447 --> 01:03:25,710
She says that ever since she was a
little girl, she'd heard about Texas,

637
01:03:27,216 --> 01:03:31,275
and it'd always been the dream of
her life to have a home here someday.

638
01:03:32,384 --> 01:03:34,943
- She did?
- She did.

639
01:03:43,989 --> 01:03:46,479
Last herd just come in, Judge.

640
01:04:05,865 --> 01:04:07,195
Well?

641
01:04:07,665 --> 01:04:08,664
Huh?

642
01:04:13,934 --> 01:04:14,933
Oh.

643
01:05:41,201 --> 01:05:42,201
By gobs!

644
01:05:48,838 --> 01:05:50,395
A lock of her own hair!

645
01:05:53,906 --> 01:05:55,429
It's kind of dark, ain't it?

646
01:06:00,176 --> 01:06:02,870
Yeah, she uses lots of shampoo on her hair.

647
01:06:02,976 --> 01:06:03,975
She does?

648
01:06:05,011 --> 01:06:07,569
It's beautiful. Beautiful.

649
01:06:09,946 --> 01:06:12,811
I'll never forget this, Cole. Never.

650
01:06:16,981 --> 01:06:19,312
- Let me see it, will you?
- What for?

651
01:06:20,383 --> 01:06:22,247
I ain't going to keep it.

652
01:06:23,118 --> 01:06:25,107
I'd like to see you try.

653
01:06:34,888 --> 01:06:38,652
- All right?
- All right.

654
01:06:47,294 --> 01:06:49,227
I know how you feel, son.

655
01:07:02,833 --> 01:07:04,459
Almighty God,

656
01:07:04,533 --> 01:07:08,729
we offer thee thanksgiving for
thy help and thy divine bounty.

657
01:07:09,569 --> 01:07:12,195
Thou has poured thy blessings on our land.

658
01:07:13,003 --> 01:07:16,767
<i>Thou hast visited the
Earth and made it plenteous.</i>

659
01:07:16,905 --> 01:07:19,997
<i>Thou hast made it soft with drops of rain,</i>

660
01:07:20,173 --> 01:07:23,697
<i>and the land that was desolate
has become like a garden,</i>

661
01:07:24,474 --> 01:07:28,498
<i>and the waste places are
become fenced and are inhabited.</i>

662
01:07:28,742 --> 01:07:32,073
<i>Thou hast made the tree of
the field yield her fruit,</i>

663
01:07:32,144 --> 01:07:33,770
<i>and the Earth, her increase.</i>

664
01:07:34,645 --> 01:07:37,077
Thou hast broken the bonds of our yoke

665
01:07:37,146 --> 01:07:39,773
and delivered us out of
the hands of our enemies,

666
01:07:40,614 --> 01:07:45,514
so that we shall dwell here safely,
and none shall make us afraid,

667
01:07:45,649 --> 01:07:51,584
and for this, thy divine bounty,
Oh, Lord, we thank thee. Amen.

668
01:07:52,118 --> 01:07:53,414
Amen.
- Amen.

669
01:08:22,296 --> 01:08:24,024
<i>One foot up and the other foot down</i>

670
01:08:24,097 --> 01:08:26,656
<i>Swing them pretty girls 'round and 'round</i>

671
01:08:34,435 --> 01:08:36,924
Here it is.
- What?

672
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:40,461
Tell me something first.

673
01:08:41,871 --> 01:08:43,395
Where do you keep my lock of hair?

674
01:08:44,439 --> 01:08:45,769
Oh, uh...

675
01:08:47,306 --> 01:08:48,305
Show me.

676
01:08:53,976 --> 01:08:56,568
Nobody can see that, not even you.

677
01:09:02,246 --> 01:09:06,112
Look, Cole, the best piece of
homestead land in the whole country.

678
01:09:08,681 --> 01:09:11,375
It used to belong to one of
the hired men that left us,

679
01:09:11,449 --> 01:09:13,973
and now it's anybody's. You just claim it.

680
01:09:15,718 --> 01:09:18,549
Yeah, that's a fine piece of land all right.

681
01:09:18,685 --> 01:09:20,743
Yeah, look at the feed on
those slopes over there,

682
01:09:21,353 --> 01:09:24,684
and that strip along the bottom
is just fine for wheat or corn.

683
01:09:27,521 --> 01:09:30,148
And, Cole, look, that
little knoll right there,

684
01:09:31,857 --> 01:09:34,085
it's just begging for a house.

685
01:09:38,026 --> 01:09:42,051
- Do you know how to build a house?
- No, how?

686
01:09:45,229 --> 01:09:47,752
Well, you... You...

687
01:09:52,064 --> 01:09:54,623
Well, you have the kitchen there,

688
01:09:56,467 --> 01:09:59,798
and the bedroom over there, and
the living room right in the middle.

689
01:10:01,435 --> 01:10:04,402
It would have to have the
right things in it, too.

690
01:10:05,837 --> 01:10:07,030
What sort of things?

691
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:14,329
Oh, fires and lamplights, warm beds,

692
01:10:16,208 --> 01:10:19,800
the smell of coffee in the morning,
the sound of rain on the roof.

693
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:26,205
Gee, that's a nice house, Jane Ellen.

694
01:10:43,251 --> 01:10:44,250
Jane!

695
01:11:01,425 --> 01:11:02,424
Look!

696
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:10,393
Go to your homes!
Protect your houses!

697
01:11:10,461 --> 01:11:12,052
Hey, Wade, grab another team,

698
01:11:12,129 --> 01:11:14,562
we'll take a section of rail fence
and knock down a strip of corn.

699
01:11:15,031 --> 01:11:16,963
Maybe we can start a backfire.

700
01:11:22,566 --> 01:11:24,430
Take the two end sections, Wade!

701
01:12:36,362 --> 01:12:39,886
Cole! Cole! Cole!

702
01:12:56,436 --> 01:12:58,300
Hey, get out of here! Move!

703
01:13:25,381 --> 01:13:26,779
Look, the house!

704
01:14:06,696 --> 01:14:11,995
Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Father!

705
01:14:16,067 --> 01:14:18,363
Help! Help!

706
01:14:21,569 --> 01:14:23,035
Come on, hurry up!

707
01:14:55,382 --> 01:14:58,145
- Watch out for his leg and shoulder.
All right.

708
01:15:01,651 --> 01:15:02,674
Take it easy.

709
01:15:02,752 --> 01:15:04,844
- Have you seen Jane Mathews?
No.

710
01:16:31,453 --> 01:16:34,977
So I hereby christen this town Langtry!

711
01:16:39,389 --> 01:16:43,447
No man ever gave a woman a whole
town afore, but I'm doing it,

712
01:16:43,757 --> 01:16:48,191
and from now on, this whole section's
going to bloom like the Jersey Lily herself!

713
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:54,427
Quiet! I ain't through yet.

714
01:16:55,495 --> 01:16:58,860
Miss Langtry's coming soon
to play a night in Fort Davis,

715
01:16:58,930 --> 01:17:01,692
and I want every legal
resident of Langtry, Texas,

716
01:17:01,764 --> 01:17:04,822
to go over and see the
godmother of this here town,

717
01:17:04,899 --> 01:17:09,629
a town of cattlemen, for cattlemen,
and by gobs, run by cattlemen!

718
01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:21,304
Now, in honor of this great occasion,
I'm dishing out free beer to one and all,

719
01:17:21,372 --> 01:17:24,032
and anybody found sober after sundown

720
01:17:24,106 --> 01:17:27,596
is liable to arrest for disorderly
conduct, and that's my ruling!

721
01:17:30,176 --> 01:17:31,767
Start the music!

722
01:18:51,307 --> 01:18:54,502
"And man that is born of
woman has but a short time to live.

723
01:18:55,875 --> 01:18:58,842
"He cometh up and is cut down like a flower.

724
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:04,374
"He fleeth as if it were a shadow,
and never continueth in one stay.

725
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:10,804
"In the midst of life, we are in death. "

726
01:19:41,893 --> 01:19:46,020
The wagon train's left. The
people have all gone, Jane Ellen.

727
01:19:46,094 --> 01:19:50,755
I'm staying. Nobody's going
to drive me away from my land,

728
01:19:51,630 --> 01:19:55,324
not with cattle, or fire, or
killing my father, or anything else.

729
01:19:56,232 --> 01:19:59,688
I'll be here long after Bean and
his gang of murderers are gone.

730
01:20:01,601 --> 01:20:04,363
Sure you will, and me, too.

731
01:20:06,035 --> 01:20:07,034
I don't want you.

732
01:20:08,203 --> 01:20:10,931
I don't want any of Roy
Bean's friends around.

733
01:20:12,004 --> 01:20:15,904
Wade Harper was right. I didn't
believe it then, but I do now.

734
01:20:16,306 --> 01:20:18,431
You knew we were going to be burned out.

735
01:20:18,673 --> 01:20:19,969
That's why you herded all the cattle out,

736
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:22,405
so they wouldn't be burned with our crops.

737
01:20:24,876 --> 01:20:29,436
No, I don't need your help. Not now.

738
01:20:31,146 --> 01:20:33,044
I can do what I have to do alone.

739
01:20:39,915 --> 01:20:41,381
I'll be back.

740
01:21:20,230 --> 01:21:21,821
Why, Cole!

741
01:21:22,765 --> 01:21:24,823
By gobs, man, I'm glad to see you.

742
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:27,196
Why, I never wanted to see a
man so much before in my life.

743
01:21:27,267 --> 01:21:28,665
- What for?
- What for?

744
01:21:28,734 --> 01:21:31,429
Don't you know what for?
She's coming to Fort Davis.

745
01:21:31,701 --> 01:21:34,533
- Lily Langtry's coming to Fort Davis.
- Langtry?

746
01:21:34,670 --> 01:21:36,795
Langtry, yeah, and you and me
are going over there together.

747
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:39,667
You're going to introduce me to
her. By gobs, I'm going to meet her.

748
01:21:39,738 --> 01:21:41,602
- I just can't believe it.
- I want to talk to you, Judge.

749
01:21:41,672 --> 01:21:43,696
Yeah, all right. And look what
I got to tell her when I see her.

750
01:21:43,773 --> 01:21:47,673
Langtry, that's the name of this
town, a great town after a great woman.

751
01:21:48,008 --> 01:21:50,237
- I said I wanted to talk to you, Judge.
- Sure.

752
01:21:52,776 --> 01:21:53,868
Cole, it's a great day.

753
01:21:53,944 --> 01:21:56,740
I tell you, it's the greatest
day in the history of Texas.

754
01:22:00,547 --> 01:22:03,207
- Some fire, huh?
- Yeah, wasn't it, though?

755
01:22:03,281 --> 01:22:05,839
- Yeah, too bad.
- Yeah.

756
01:22:07,082 --> 01:22:08,081
Yep.

757
01:22:08,616 --> 01:22:11,606
- I wonder who was behind it?
- Oh, a fire don't need nothing behind it.

758
01:22:11,684 --> 01:22:14,480
Fire has a way of moving
on its own. Here's how.

759
01:22:17,386 --> 01:22:20,320
Before I drink with you, Judge, I want
to know you had nothing to do with it.

760
01:22:20,388 --> 01:22:22,854
Me? Why, how can you say a thing like that?

761
01:22:22,988 --> 01:22:24,545
Didn't I round up all them cattle for you?

762
01:22:24,622 --> 01:22:26,953
Wasn't I right here in the
saloon when the fire broke out?

763
01:22:27,023 --> 01:22:28,285
Didn't...

764
01:22:30,658 --> 01:22:34,183
Well, I was, and what's more,
I ain't got no idea who done it.

765
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,283
Now, drink up.

766
01:22:42,629 --> 01:22:44,596
- Don't you believe me?
- No.

767
01:22:47,831 --> 01:22:52,731
Now, listen, son, I told you how it was,
and I don't want you calling me no liar.

768
01:22:53,934 --> 01:22:55,560
Now, drink hearty.

769
01:22:59,236 --> 01:23:00,235
Will you swear by that?

770
01:23:01,836 --> 01:23:03,928
There ain't no reason I
should, but I'm willing.

771
01:23:04,438 --> 01:23:07,701
All right, I swear by my sword
there I had nothing to do with it.

772
01:23:08,105 --> 01:23:09,503
I swear by the revised statutes.

773
01:23:10,073 --> 01:23:12,267
By gobs, if there was a Bible in town I'd...

774
01:23:12,374 --> 01:23:13,931
Where's that lock of hair?

775
01:23:15,542 --> 01:23:18,031
- Right here with me.
- Let me see it.

776
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:28,979
Swear on that?

777
01:23:33,649 --> 01:23:35,979
All right, it was me. I
burned their houses and crops.

778
01:23:36,083 --> 01:23:38,642
- I run them varmints out.
- Nice going.

779
01:23:38,718 --> 01:23:39,717
And if you think...

780
01:23:42,419 --> 01:23:44,443
If you think I'm sorry, you're crazy.

781
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,918
I'm proud and glad I rid the country of them.

782
01:23:46,987 --> 01:23:50,512
It was either them or us, and now
the range grass will grow back,

783
01:23:50,589 --> 01:23:52,715
and some day, the cattlemen
will put up a statue of me

784
01:23:52,790 --> 01:23:54,757
out there on the street,
and they'll write on it,

785
01:23:54,824 --> 01:23:58,087
"Judge Roy Bean, he give us back the land. "

786
01:24:01,293 --> 01:24:02,657
You get warrants in Fort Davis, don't you?

787
01:24:02,727 --> 01:24:03,818
Yeah, that's where they get them,

788
01:24:03,894 --> 01:24:05,121
but they don't know how to spell my name.

789
01:24:05,194 --> 01:24:07,024
- It's been tried before.
- I'll get one.

790
01:24:08,295 --> 01:24:10,353
This time, you're going to get
what's coming to you, Judge.

791
01:24:13,531 --> 01:24:14,623
Cole!

792
01:24:15,565 --> 01:24:19,192
You and me's friends. I done what I
had to, and you think it was wrong.

793
01:24:19,267 --> 01:24:21,790
But if it was my own son
come over here with a warrant,

794
01:24:22,268 --> 01:24:24,064
he'd have to be first on the draw.

795
01:24:24,768 --> 01:24:29,169
I aim to be, unless I get it in
the back before I get out of here.

796
01:25:11,953 --> 01:25:13,250
So long, Cole.

797
01:25:24,791 --> 01:25:26,621
Make out a warrant against Roy Bean.

798
01:25:29,227 --> 01:25:30,818
Raise your right hand.

799
01:25:31,394 --> 01:25:33,418
Do you solemnly swear to carry
out the duties of deputy sheriff

800
01:25:33,495 --> 01:25:35,223
in Jeff Davis County in the state of Texas?

801
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:36,295
Yep.

802
01:25:41,565 --> 01:25:42,565
Thanks, Sheriff.

803
01:26:06,141 --> 01:26:07,573
How much are tickets?

804
01:26:07,642 --> 01:26:10,438
$2 apiece, all over the house.
First come, first served.

805
01:26:10,909 --> 01:26:13,433
- How many seats in the house?
- Four hundred.

806
01:26:13,511 --> 01:26:15,409
- I'll take them.
- How many?

807
01:26:15,511 --> 01:26:16,876
All of them.

808
01:26:29,784 --> 01:26:30,783
Much obliged.

809
01:26:32,218 --> 01:26:33,616
Let me have two tickets.

810
01:26:43,255 --> 01:26:46,484
If I was you, Judge, I wouldn't set
foot in Fort Davis to see Adam and Eve.

811
01:26:46,556 --> 01:26:47,556
Me, either.

812
01:26:47,624 --> 01:26:50,420
A deputy's star
makes the finest kind of a target.

813
01:26:50,892 --> 01:26:53,757
How you know you're not heading into a trap?

814
01:26:53,826 --> 01:26:55,884
Sure looking for trouble,
going over to Fort Davis.

815
01:26:55,961 --> 01:26:56,960
Taking an awful chance, Judge.

816
01:26:57,061 --> 01:26:59,290
<i>Them hombres just waiting down there for you.</i>

817
01:26:59,361 --> 01:27:02,795
Why, you pack of yellow
bellies, give me them tickets.

818
01:27:10,566 --> 01:27:12,226
You mean, you're going to Fort Davis alone?

819
01:27:12,301 --> 01:27:13,961
Not by a jugful, I ain't.

820
01:27:14,034 --> 01:27:15,933
You're all going with me as a guard of honor,

821
01:27:16,035 --> 01:27:19,264
right up to the opera house,
but I'm going in alone.

822
01:27:19,336 --> 01:27:22,031
I don't want nobody in there with me no how.

823
01:27:22,104 --> 01:27:25,003
I ain't sharing the Jersey Lily with no one.

824
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:27,269
Now, come on, we got a
day's ride ahead of us.

825
01:27:27,339 --> 01:27:29,829
I'm going to dress, and you
fellows proud yourselves up a bit.

826
01:27:29,907 --> 01:27:31,771
Chickenfoot, my sword.

827
01:27:54,816 --> 01:27:57,511
I ain't wore this uniform since Chickamauga,

828
01:27:57,751 --> 01:27:59,513
but it still fits right smart.

829
01:28:05,854 --> 01:28:08,753
Bean and his men are
coming! Get off the street!

830
01:28:10,222 --> 01:28:12,348
Bean and his men are coming!

831
01:28:20,794 --> 01:28:23,488
Bean's coming! Bean's coming!

832
01:28:39,801 --> 01:28:40,800
Hey, look!

833
01:28:43,402 --> 01:28:44,732
They must have heard I was coming.

834
01:28:59,508 --> 01:29:01,372
All right, boys, take your places.

835
01:29:10,813 --> 01:29:12,245
Hey, this is the stage entrance.

836
01:29:16,248 --> 01:29:18,646
Now, remember, I want strict
privacy all during the show.

837
01:29:18,882 --> 01:29:20,371
You'll get it.

838
01:29:37,323 --> 01:29:38,322
Third seat in.

839
01:29:57,997 --> 01:30:01,692
- Pardon, sir, your seat is back here.
- No, it ain't. It's right here.

840
01:30:47,417 --> 01:30:50,509
Say, when does Miss Langtry go on the play?

841
01:30:50,918 --> 01:30:53,407
Right after the curtain.
She's about to go up now, sir.

842
01:30:53,486 --> 01:30:55,646
- Go up?
- The curtain, sir.

843
01:31:11,659 --> 01:31:12,818
Now?

844
01:31:14,127 --> 01:31:15,821
Yes, now.

845
01:31:19,496 --> 01:31:20,655
Now.

846
01:31:46,906 --> 01:31:50,271
Don't make a move, Judge.
I'm coming down to get you.

847
01:31:51,674 --> 01:31:52,674
Come shooting.

848
01:32:27,555 --> 01:32:28,816
- The war's on.
- Yeah.

849
01:32:28,889 --> 01:32:30,947
Wish I was in there to see that show.

850
01:32:31,223 --> 01:32:33,985
- I bet the judge is having a good time.
- Yeah.

851
01:33:54,422 --> 01:33:55,421
Hey!

852
01:33:57,023 --> 01:33:59,252
Let's you and me stand up and shoot it out.

853
01:34:01,325 --> 01:34:03,121
That suits me, Judge.

854
01:34:04,993 --> 01:34:07,118
Put up your gun. We'll draw.

855
01:34:07,961 --> 01:34:08,960
All right.

856
01:34:15,197 --> 01:34:16,925
- Ready?
- Yeah.

857
01:34:52,011 --> 01:34:53,943
Now, you see what you done?

858
01:34:55,313 --> 01:34:56,312
You stopped the show.

859
01:34:57,546 --> 01:34:59,570
I was going to see Lily.

860
01:35:04,282 --> 01:35:06,374
Now it's too late.

861
01:35:07,083 --> 01:35:08,777
No, it isn't, Judge.

862
01:35:09,618 --> 01:35:12,084
She's back there now, waiting to see you.

863
01:35:15,186 --> 01:35:16,278
What?

864
01:35:17,387 --> 01:35:20,582
She knows all about you,
Judge. She wants to meet you.

865
01:35:20,655 --> 01:35:22,622
She told me so herself.

866
01:35:25,290 --> 01:35:27,814
Come on, let's go back and see her.

867
01:35:34,528 --> 01:35:35,721
My hat.

868
01:36:04,405 --> 01:36:05,405
Where's Miss Langtry?

869
01:36:06,940 --> 01:36:08,907
Put me down. I can walk.

870
01:36:10,108 --> 01:36:12,939
Put me down, I tell you. That's my ruling.

871
01:37:01,061 --> 01:37:05,688
Miss Langtry, I'd like to present
an old admirer. Judge Roy Bean.

872
01:37:11,965 --> 01:37:14,761
I'm pleased to meet you.

873
01:38:18,257 --> 01:38:21,020
Cole, come here quick!

874
01:38:25,761 --> 01:38:26,760
Look!

875
01:38:31,763 --> 01:38:33,855
See, what did I tell
you? They're coming back.

876
01:38:35,031 --> 01:38:36,554
Wagons by the score.

877
01:38:38,065 --> 01:38:39,497
It's the promised land.

878
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:41,499
Jane Ellen,

879
01:38:43,067 --> 01:38:46,626
someday, Texas is going to be
the biggest and the finest...
