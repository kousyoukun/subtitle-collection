put it up there last night.

you've been tried and found guilty

of the most serious crime
west of the Pecos,

Got anything to say for yourself before
the sentence of the court is executed?

11

I told you they shot at me first!

I didn't mean to kill that steer on purpose!
I was aiming at the man.

Glad to join you.
Have you ever met Miss Langtry?

27

No, I never met her. I never met the sun,
I never shook hands with the moon,

and I've never been introduced
to no clouds.

That's all right. Too bad Lily Langtry
couldn't have heard that.

No, I was in England once,
but didn't get around to it.

- Yeah.

when some of your wranglers came up
and took him away.

62
00:09:09,854 --> 00:09:14,952
Oh, yeah, he was hanging around out there
a while back, but he ain't around now.

63
00:09:15,252 --> 00:09:18,052
Your men not only took him away,
but they tore down the fence.

64
00:09:18,152 --> 00:09:20,950
Not a stick of it was left standing.
JUDGE BEAN: That so?

65
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:23,950
Yes, that's so, and you needn't pretend
you don't know about it.

66
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:28,048
Well, it don't surprise me none.
It's against the law

00:09:28,148 --> 00:09:30,646
- What law? Whose law?
- Mine.

68
00:09:30,746 --> 00:09:33,646
- Now, you listen to me, Mr. Bean.
- Judge Bean.

69
00:09:33,746 --> 00:09:37,544
You're no more a judge than I am.
Just call yourself a judge.

70
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:41,144
I wouldn't say that if I was you.
I might consider it contempt of court.

71
00:09:41,244 --> 00:09:44,442
It's contempt, all right.
You call this a court?

72
00:09:44,742 --> 00:09:50,140
I do, and it happens to be
in session right now.

73
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,638
Now, you sit down, Miss Mathews,
and I'll tend to your case in a minute.

74
00:09:55,238 --> 00:09:59,536
You're charged with stealing a horse.
Guilty or not guilty?

75
00:09:59,636 --> 00:10:01,636
- JUDGE BEAN: Where's exhibit A?
- Huh?

76
00:10:01,736 --> 00:10:06,034
Where's the horse?
Bring in the horse, Chickenfoot.

77
00:10:06,434 --> 00:10:10,234
Miss Mathews, when cattle can't get
to water, they die.

78
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,132
There's miles of river on each side
of our homestead.

It always was, and always will be.

CHICKENFOOT: Get in there. All right,
give me room there, you guys.

81
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:23,628
Whoa, Pete. Come on in here.

82
00:10:24,328 --> 00:10:29,226
Come on, get over there.
Give us a little room.

83
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:32,526
Mr. Harden, it's my duty to inform you

84
00:10:32,626 --> 00:10:37,024
that the larceny of an equine
is a capital offense, punishable by death,

85
00:10:37,624 --> 00:10:39,324
but you can rest assured that,
in this court,

86
00:10:39,424 --> 00:10:43,022
a horse thief always gets a fair trial
before he's hung.

87
00:10:44,422 --> 00:10:47,820
- Chickenfoot, that's your horse?
- Oh, why, Judge...

88
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,320
Can you prove it's your horse?

89
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:54,218
Why, Judge, anybody here... I can prove
it by Pete himself that he's my horse.

90
00:10:55,018 --> 00:10:57,516
Pete, you're my horse, ain't you?

91
00:10:58,216 --> 00:11:03,614
Ownership of horse clearly established.
It belongs to Chickenfoot.

92
00:11:04,214 --> 00:11:06,414
Well, I don't contest it, Your Honor.
Maybe the horse does belong

93
00:11:06,514 --> 00:11:09,412
to Chickenfoot here, but I didn't steal it.

94
00:11:09,512 --> 00:11:12,312
- How'd you get it then?
- I bought it.

95
00:11:12,412 --> 00:11:17,410
JUDGE BEAN: Order in the court!
- That all you got to say?

96
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,210
No, it's not. I'm not going to stay here
and see anybody railroaded like this.

97
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:23,208
Miss Mathews, I don't recollect you was
summoned as a witness in this trial.

98
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,808
What kind of a trial is it when a prisoner

99
00:11:24,808 --> 00:11:26,506
isn't even allowed to have anybody
speak for him?

100
00:11:26,606 --> 00:11:27,606
You an attorney, Miss?

101
00:11:27,706 --> 00:11:29,706
I'm as much an attorney
as you are a judge.

102
00:11:29,806 --> 00:11:31,106
- You know this man?
- No, I don't.

103
00:11:31,206 --> 00:11:32,404
- You ever see him before?
- No, but...

104
00:11:32,504 --> 00:11:34,104
- Can you prove he didn't steal the horse?
- No.

105
00:11:34,204 --> 00:11:36,904
Then he don't need no lawyer then.
This man was caught on a stolen horse,

106
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,702
and in this jurisdiction,
that's prima facie evidence.

107
00:11:38,802 --> 00:11:43,900
- The case is closed and that's my ruling.
- Yes, and it's just like all your rulings!

108
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,200
The courtroom will now be cleared
of everybody,

109
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,298
excepting the judge, the jury, the prisoner,
the witnesses and...

110
00:11:53,398 --> 00:11:57,696
I guess that means you.
All right, I'll go.

111
00:11:58,396 --> 00:12:02,994
It's murder, that's what it is. Murder.
This man hasn't got a chance,

112
00:12:03,094 --> 00:12:04,794
but you never give anybody a chance.

113
00:12:04,894 --> 00:12:08,092
You didn't give us one when you
stampeded the cattle over our crops.

114
00:12:08,192 --> 00:12:10,892
You thought you'd starve
the homesteaders out, but you didn't.

115
00:12:10,992 --> 00:12:14,190
You can pester us and rob us and kill us,
but you can't stop us.

116
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,790
'Cause there'll always be more coming.
More and more.

117
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:21,788
And we'll stay on our farms in spite of you,
and your courtroom and your killers!

118
00:12:22,788 --> 00:12:25,786
By gobs, she's all right.
She'd make a good cattleman.

119
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:28,386
If it wasn't for Lily, I'd marry her.

120
00:12:48,578 --> 00:12:49,678
Giddap.

121
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,478
You heard the case against the accused,
pro and con.

122
00:12:52,578 --> 00:12:56,376
Now I guess maybe you'd better retire
to consider a verdict.

123
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:59,574
(HORSE HOOVES CLOPPING)

124
00:12:59,674 --> 00:13:01,974
Chickenfoot, you'd better take
Pete out for a little fresh air.

125
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:04,674
Take him out, Bart. I got work to do.

126
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:15,670
And while you retire,
there'll be a recess for them that's thirsty.

127
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:24,066
Well, I guess you can't take it with you.

128
00:13:25,566 --> 00:13:26,966
It's got to be strictly understood

129
00:13:27,066 --> 00:13:30,464
you ain't making no effort to influence
the sober judgment of the jury.

130
00:13:30,564 --> 00:13:33,164
- Certainly not.
- There you are.

131
00:13:33,664 --> 00:13:37,062
- Compliments of the prisoner.
- Jury to the rear!

132
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,660
Bull's-eye.

133
00:13:51,356 --> 00:13:54,356
- Join me, Your Honor?
- Don't mind if I do.

134
00:13:56,456 --> 00:14:00,454
Don't spill none of that liquor, son.
It eats right into the bar.

To the unfortunate lady
with the bullet in her face.

136
00:14:22,046 --> 00:14:27,044
The man that fired that bullet
was hauled out of here feet first.

137
00:14:27,144 --> 00:14:30,144
Any man that'd shoot at a picture
of Lily Langtry ought to be killed.

138
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:34,842
It's just retribution.
It's justifiable homicide,

139
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:36,142
Right.

140
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,440
You an admirer of Miss Lily's, too?

141
00:14:43,739 --> 00:14:46,338
Well, that's putting it mildly.

142
00:14:48,838 --> 00:14:51,736
She's the most beautiful woman
I ever met.

143
00:14:53,136 --> 00:14:54,236
Met?

144
00:14:56,334 --> 00:15:01,532
You mean to tell me you met Lily Langtry,
the real her, in the flesh?

145
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:04,632
What an actress.

146
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,530
How'd you get to know her?

147
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,828
Well, that's a long story, Judge.

148
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:19,326
Bart, you and Blackjack
get yourself a drink, huh?

149
00:15:21,726 --> 00:15:27,224
Mighty fine liquor. What do you call it?
- Rub of the brush. Go on.

150
00:15:27,324 --> 00:15:31,022
- Did you get to know her real well?
- It's got character.

151
00:15:34,922 --> 00:15:37,820
I said, did you get to know her real well?

152
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:44,918
Now, Judge, you forget a gentleman
never discusses a lady in a barroom.

153
00:15:45,018 --> 00:15:48,016
Who said it's a barroom?
This is a courtroom.

154
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:53,116
Say, tell me,
is she as pretty as them pictures?

155
00:15:54,914 --> 00:15:58,914
Why, the picture's never been made
that can do justice to Lily Langtry.

156
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:00,712
Is she good-natured?

157
00:16:03,412 --> 00:16:04,811
An angel.

158
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,808
- I'll never forget the night we met.
- Yeah?

159
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:18,706
I'll never forget it as long as I live.

160
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,698
Who was that?
Oh, that's Mort Borrow.

161
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:45,796
Go on about Lily.

162
00:16:49,896 --> 00:16:51,394
Oh, yeah, Lily.

163
00:16:58,692 --> 00:17:03,190
How about a verdict?
Can't you see

164
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:08,690
SOUTHEAST: Two aces.
COWBOY 1: Bet a dollar and a half.

165
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:14,088
Get away from here.
You smell of formaldehyde!

166
00:17:14,886 --> 00:17:17,886
You been down around Lanno Bay,
ain't you?

167
00:17:17,986 --> 00:17:20,884
Well, you know how it is at sunset.

168
00:17:21,984 --> 00:17:26,782
You can look out and that water ain't
exactly blue, and it ain't exactly purple.

169
00:17:27,482 --> 00:17:31,482
It's a kind of color a man can feel,
but he can't put a name to.

170
00:17:31,582 --> 00:17:32,680
Yeah.

171
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,780
Well, that's Lily's eyes.

172
00:17:39,178 --> 00:17:40,478
By gobs!

173
00:17:47,476 --> 00:17:50,974
COWBOY 1: I'm out.
COWBOY 2: I'll stay out. Here we go.

174
00:17:50,974 --> 00:17:53,474
COWBOY 3: Got 10. Got a nine.

175
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:58,372
You know how bright
and coppery and gold-like

176
00:17:58,472 --> 00:18:01,370
a young chestnut horse
is running in the bright sun?

177
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:05,470
- Yeah.
- Well, her hair is something like that.

178
00:18:08,168 --> 00:18:09,668
In the daytime.

179
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:15,866
You mean it's different at night?
Well, not different,

180
00:18:16,366 --> 00:18:19,164
- How so?
- Well...

181
00:18:20,364 --> 00:18:25,362
Well, you know how it is at dusk when
you see a prairie fire reflected in the sky.

182
00:18:26,362 --> 00:18:31,960
A sort of a deep...
A beautiful kind of blushing...

183
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,060
- Red?
- Red.

184
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:40,258
- Well, that'll give you a rough idea.
- By gobs.

185
00:18:45,456 --> 00:18:47,556
I got a lock of her hair.

186
00:18:49,354 --> 00:18:51,154
(JUDGE BEAN STUTTERS)

187
00:18:51,154 --> 00:18:55,052
You mean to tell me you actually got
the real... From her head?

188
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,650
I don't suppose you'd ever part
with that lock of hair,

189
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,548
no matter what a man was willing to give?

190
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,646
A man don't trade things like that.

191
00:19:14,546 --> 00:19:16,744
You see that sword up there?

192
00:19:17,244 --> 00:19:20,944
I wore it in the civil war.
Always meant to be buried with it.

193
00:19:20,944 --> 00:19:23,642
Now, if you was willing to swap, why...

194
00:19:25,242 --> 00:19:27,042
Would you really like to have it?

195
00:19:27,142 --> 00:19:31,240
I'd rather own it than the state of Texas.
Let's have a look at it.

196
00:19:33,938 --> 00:19:35,938
I haven't got it with me.

197
00:19:39,238 --> 00:19:40,736
Where's it at?

198
00:19:42,036 --> 00:19:44,336
It's with my stuff in El Paso.

199
00:19:44,336 --> 00:19:47,634
So, you was in the civil war, huh, Judge?

200
00:19:47,734 --> 00:19:49,734
- El Paso, huh?
- Yeah.

201
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:54,532
- Cavalry, huh?
- I suppose you could write for it.

202
00:19:57,132 --> 00:19:58,430
Yeah.

203
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,530
Wouldn't take long to get here
by mail coach.

204
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,628
Oh, two, three weeks.

205
00:20:05,828 --> 00:20:08,626
- Two or three weeks, huh?
- Yeah, about.

206
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,020
But I wouldn't part with that lock of hair
for anything in the world.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,114
JUDGE BEAN: That bottle of whiskey
gone already?

210
00:20:44,214 --> 00:20:48,314
Yeah, and if he ain't paid for it,
you better start collecting now.

211
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:04,508
- What's the verdict?
- You know what the verdict is. Guilty.

212
00:21:10,306 --> 00:21:12,704
There's only one thing I can do.

213
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:16,904
You're sentenced to hang,
that's my ruling.

214
00:21:16,904 --> 00:21:20,702
- But, Judge, you just ruled...
- I didn't finish my ruling.

215
00:21:22,902 --> 00:21:25,700
The court sentenced the prisoner to hang,

216
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,400
but the court didn't say when.
So long as there's reasonable doubt...

217
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,898
What reasonable doubt, Judge?
We just caught him

218
00:21:32,998 --> 00:21:35,598
- Ain't any room for doubt.
- Order!

219
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:41,594
I been talking to the prisoner.
He's a friend of Lily Langtry's.

220
00:21:42,694 --> 00:21:46,894
Stands to reason no friend of Lily Langtry
goes around stealing horses.

221
00:21:46,894 --> 00:21:50,892
Leastways, there's a reasonable doubt.
You mean,

222
00:21:50,992 --> 00:21:53,990
That ain't what I said.
When I make a ruling, it stands.

223
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:57,590
But, Judge, you just sentenced the man.
His sentence is suspended

224
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:01,988
for a couple weeks
until I can look into the matter further.

225
00:22:16,682 --> 00:22:19,982
- Hi, Mort. How's business?
- Just lost a customer.

226
00:22:20,182 --> 00:22:23,780
Well, I'll be down for a shave in a minute.
All right, you're next.

227
00:22:34,176 --> 00:22:36,476
- Howdy, Judge.
- Hello, Evans.

228
00:22:36,476 --> 00:22:38,276
Jersey Lily special.

229
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:55,970
Pardon me, you don't happen
to have a twin brother, do you?

230
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,568
No, not me.

231
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:01,868
Well, you'd better pay me that money
you owe me:

232
00:23:01,968 --> 00:23:06,366
You're loco, brother.
I don't owe you nothing.

233
00:23:11,664 --> 00:23:12,764
$60.

234
00:24:07,444 --> 00:24:10,544
If you're interested, that's the man
that sold me the roan horse.

235
00:24:10,644 --> 00:24:13,042
Then, he's the man that stole...

236
00:24:54,428 --> 00:24:56,828
$84 and 6 bits.

237
00:25:05,524 --> 00:25:10,622
Fined $80 for disorderly conduct,
and $4 and 6 bits

238
00:25:11,622 --> 00:25:16,520
Now, you men get some rope
and string him up.

239
00:25:16,921 --> 00:25:20,020
We hang horse thieves, don't we?
String him up!

240
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,718
Come inside, son.

241
00:25:28,516 --> 00:25:31,016
You can have his horse and outfit.

242
00:25:38,714 --> 00:25:41,412
- Rub of the brush?
- Rub of the brush.

00:37:17,572 --> 00:37:20,472
If you'd shoot back,
maybe they'd stop bothering you.

299
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:23,770
And so did Shad Wilkins,
and he ain't trying it no more.

300
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,770
What about your own quarter section?

301
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:28,370
- Lf you leave, you'll lose it.
- We don't want no part of it.

302
00:37:28,468 --> 00:37:30,168
All right, Hod. If you feel that way,

303
00:37:30,168 --> 00:37:33,967
we'll try to get along
with just Eph and Henry.

304
00:37:36,066 --> 00:37:40,165
Henry, if we only had one man,
it'd be a big help.

305
00:37:40,264 --> 00:37:41,964
Sorry, Mr. Mathews.

306
00:37:51,062 --> 00:37:53,460
JANE ELLEN: Call themselves men.

307
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:03,056
Wade, what do we do?

308
00:38:08,056 --> 00:38:12,654
- I know what to do.
- No, no, wait. That's not the way.

309
00:38:12,654 --> 00:38:14,553
Don't even think of it.

310
00:38:16,352 --> 00:38:19,252
Wade, aren't you going to stay for supper?

311
00:38:19,752 --> 00:38:21,150
I'll be back.

312
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:37,345
Well, they left.

313
00:38:37,345 --> 00:38:39,244
Of course they have. What did you expect?

314
00:38:39,344 --> 00:38:41,144
My hands quit, too.
You can't blame them for leaving.

315
00:38:41,244 --> 00:38:43,244
There won't be a hired man left
in this part of the country

316
00:38:43,343 --> 00:38:47,142
if we don't do something about it.
We hire new hands,

317
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:52,140
What's old Mathews going to say about it?
He keeps passing the buck

318
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,140
I say, let's do something
about it ourselves.

319
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,038
- That's right.
- That's what I like to hear.

320
00:38:56,138 --> 00:38:58,538
Let's give the judge the same thing
he gave Shad Wilkins.

321
00:38:59,038 --> 00:39:03,036
Maybe if some of us went down
and appealed to Roy Bean for justice...

322
00:39:03,136 --> 00:39:07,335
Justice. If you'd seen him yesterday,
pretending to try that prisoner...

323
00:39:07,335 --> 00:39:12,134
The man didn't have a chance.
- I wonder if they hanged him.

324
00:39:12,234 --> 00:39:17,832
He was the same as dead
even while he stood there.

325
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,330
(EX CLAIMS)

326
00:39:26,028 --> 00:39:30,926
What is it, Daughter?
The man I told you about,

327
00:39:31,026 --> 00:39:34,126
I saw him plain as day,
looking in the window.

328
00:39:37,924 --> 00:39:43,322
You're seeing things, Jane Ellen.
There's nobody out there.

329
00:39:45,322 --> 00:39:47,021
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

330
00:39:47,722 --> 00:39:49,320
Come in.

331
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,720
Good evening.

332
00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:03,216
Pardon me for intruding like this.

333
00:40:03,316 --> 00:40:08,814
(STAMMERING) Oh, no, you're not.
It's just... Well, I thought you were a ghost.

334
00:40:10,512 --> 00:40:13,312
Well, I guess
you're partly to blame I'm not.

335
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:17,312
- I just stopped in to thank you.
- Father, this is Mister...

336
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:20,910
- Harden.
- Welcome, Mr. Harden, welcome.

337
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:22,908
Glad to meet you.

338
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:28,208
Oh, Mr. Harden,
this is our neighbor Wade Harper.

339
00:40:28,406 --> 00:40:30,806
This is the man I told you about.

340
00:40:30,806 --> 00:40:33,706
You mean to tell me Bean tried you,
and let you go?

341
00:40:33,706 --> 00:40:36,704
Well, she was my lawyer.
I guess she's the one that got me off.

342
00:40:36,704 --> 00:40:39,704
- I knew you weren't a horse thief.
- Thanks.

343
00:40:40,402 --> 00:40:42,302
How did you know that?

344
00:40:43,902 --> 00:40:45,402
I just knew.

345
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:47,900
Are you working anywhere?

346
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,798
No, I'm heading for California.

347
00:40:53,498 --> 00:40:59,096
Mr. Harden, I suppose a body that's just
been hanged is apt to be a bit hungry.

348
00:40:59,096 --> 00:41:01,096
You must stay for supper.

349
00:41:04,994 --> 00:41:08,094
- Well, I don't want to put you out any.
- Oh, no, not at all.

350
00:41:08,194 --> 00:41:11,192
Matter of fact, we had some company
that just disappointed us.

351
00:41:11,292 --> 00:41:14,690
Uh-huh. We were hoping somebody'd
show up to take their place.

352
00:41:14,791 --> 00:41:18,090
Make yourself at home, now.
Make yourself at home.

353
00:41:22,888 --> 00:41:26,687
Wait till you sink your teeth
into some of Jane Ellen's stew.

354
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:39,982
CALIPHET: Oh, Lord, for that which thou
hast sent us in our hour of need,

355
00:41:40,282 --> 00:41:42,182
make us truly grateful.

356
00:41:43,382 --> 00:41:48,180
Bless this food to our use and ourselves
to thy service. Amen.

357
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:50,678
Let me help you.

358
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:54,278
How about some hominy?

359
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:57,776
- Here, Wade. Give him some milk.
- All right, all right.

360
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:02,774
I think he likes it here. I think we got him.

361
00:42:02,874 --> 00:42:05,274
- What's he doing now?
- Feeding his horse.

362
00:42:05,374 --> 00:42:10,072
Wade, he could probably take the place
of two men. He's so big and strong.

363
00:42:10,172 --> 00:42:13,571
- Well, I don't know how strong he is.
- Strong enough, Wade.

364
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:16,270
Now, Jane Ellen,
we'll leave you alone with him,

365
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:18,568
and you kind of add on
a little more welcome.

366
00:42:18,668 --> 00:42:21,268
- What'll I say?
- Oh, just keep smiling at him.

367
00:42:21,368 --> 00:42:26,066
And, Daughter,
if it should come up natural-like,

368
00:42:26,166 --> 00:42:29,466
you might hint
what a handsome man he is.

369
00:42:30,064 --> 00:42:31,264
Handsome?

370
00:42:31,364 --> 00:42:35,562
We need him terribly bad, Daughter.
We got to get that corn husked.

371
00:42:35,664 --> 00:42:37,662
We need him terribly bad.

372
00:42:37,662 --> 00:42:41,362
- Listen, your father don't mean for you to...
- Shh.

373
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:48,158
Everything all right, Mr. Harden?
- Fine, thanks.

374
00:42:48,258 --> 00:42:51,858
- Oh, don't trouble.
- No trouble at all. Come on, Wade.

375
00:43:04,654 --> 00:43:06,452
- Can I give you a hand?
- Oh, no, thanks.

376
00:43:07,152 --> 00:43:10,950
- Won't you sit down, please?
- Well, I won't argue with you.

377
00:43:11,551 --> 00:43:14,450
If I had to wash dishes,
I guess I'd give up eating.

378
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:19,448
Well, what do you do
about the dishes when you're home?

379
00:43:19,748 --> 00:43:21,648
Well, you live in a house, don't you?

380
00:43:21,848 --> 00:43:27,246
No. No, my house is all out there,
all one room with a sky for a roof.

381
00:43:28,446 --> 00:43:32,244
- Well, it's a big place.
- Got some space to rent.

382
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:37,342
Well, I guess California's
your next stop, huh?

383
00:43:37,442 --> 00:43:42,740
California, but I don't stop.
Oregon next, I guess.

384
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,038
Well, all places aren't just the same.

385
00:43:46,238 --> 00:43:49,838
Wouldn't you rather stay
a little longer in some places?

386
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:52,536
No, they're all the same,
beautiful when you leave them.

387
00:43:52,936 --> 00:43:56,236
Well, it's like the turtles.
Carry their houses with them.

388
00:43:56,336 --> 00:43:58,734
If I had to build me a house,
I'd have it on wheels.

389
00:43:59,234 --> 00:44:03,732
Not me. I'd want my house
so that nothing could ever move it.

390
00:44:04,232 --> 00:44:07,532
So down deep
that an earthquake couldn't shake it,

391
00:44:07,832 --> 00:44:11,130
and a cyclone would be
just another wind going by.

392
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:17,128
Well, you say, "Who wants to be a turtle?"

393
00:44:17,928 --> 00:44:21,726
And I say, "I hope you'll be
very happy in your house."

394
00:44:31,024 --> 00:44:35,322
- Well...
- Oh, say, wait a minute.

395
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:36,722
What?

396
00:44:36,822 --> 00:44:40,320
I'll bet I know something
we could agree on.

397
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:44,019
Well, in about a week now,
we're going to husk the corn,

398
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:47,218
and I'll bet you'll agree that that's fun.
(EX CLAIMS QUESTIONINGLY)

399
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:50,416
Well, you know, I think husking
corn's the greatest fun in the world.

400
00:44:51,216 --> 00:44:53,816
- Husking corn, fun?
- Oh, yes!

401
00:44:55,216 --> 00:44:58,914
- Well, I'd rather wash dishes.
- Oh, no.

402
00:45:00,914 --> 00:45:05,212
It was a fine supper, and good cooking.

403
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:10,110
Oh, Mr. Harden.

404
00:45:17,208 --> 00:45:19,506
What a handsome man you are.

405
00:45:23,806 --> 00:45:24,906
(SIGHS)

406
00:45:25,206 --> 00:45:30,604
I doubt that, but I'm a tired one.
Well, I hope I see you

407
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,100
Get out of here! Hey!

408
00:45:51,396 --> 00:45:56,394
If anybody'd told me yesterday
I'd be playing tag in a cornfield

409
00:45:56,794 --> 00:46:01,992
If we had some men that would ride fence,
there wouldn't be any cows

410
00:46:04,592 --> 00:46:06,890
You were sure cute last night.

411
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:13,288
Now you're making fun of me.
Well, that's...

412
00:46:19,586 --> 00:46:22,584
Hey, look at your father.
I wonder what's up.

413
00:46:30,182 --> 00:46:33,882
I tried to stop them.
They wouldn't listen to me.

414
00:46:33,882 --> 00:46:36,480
Yes, yes.
It's the wrong and lawless thing to do.

415
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:40,279
- I begged them not to. I told them.
- Who? What happened?

416
00:46:40,279 --> 00:46:44,878
Wade Harper has rounded up
some of the men.

417
00:46:44,977 --> 00:46:48,176
- When did they leave?
- About an hour ago.

418
00:47:45,556 --> 00:47:47,956
Thunder and lightning!
You back from California already?

419
00:47:48,056 --> 00:47:49,854
You got to get out of here,
and don't stop for nothing.

420
00:47:49,954 --> 00:47:50,954
Did you write to El Paso?

421
00:47:51,054 --> 00:47:53,354
Listen, just get on your horse and get,
because they're after you.

422
00:47:53,354 --> 00:47:55,952
Did you write? Who's after me?

423
00:47:56,152 --> 00:48:00,652
The homesteaders.
They're going to string you up.

424
00:48:00,652 --> 00:48:03,150
They're outside right now,
a whole wagonload of them.

425
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:06,650
A wagonload?
Why, I can handle a train load of them.

426
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:08,948
I'll tear their livers out.

427
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:37,438
What'll it be, gentlemen?
It'll be Roy Bean. Where is he?

428
00:48:39,138 --> 00:48:40,937
He's out for a while.

429
00:48:42,237 --> 00:48:45,436
That's because you came down here
and warned him.

430
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:01,630
Make a move and I'll kill you.

431
00:49:05,128 --> 00:49:07,728
Cole, start collecting them shotguns,

432
00:49:09,528 --> 00:49:14,026
uncork them rifles now
and set them down this end of the bar,

433
00:49:15,626 --> 00:49:17,224
Go on.

434
00:49:23,822 --> 00:49:26,922
Get back. Get back.

435
00:49:44,416 --> 00:49:46,614
Now, I'll take yours, Judge.

436
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,500
The drinks are on me, gentlemen.

437
00:50:36,098 --> 00:50:38,796
We're not drinking with you, Harden,
nor him, either.

438
00:50:39,296 --> 00:50:42,496
I ain't serving none of my liquor
to no bunch of tomato-kissing,

439
00:50:42,596 --> 00:50:44,894
- plow-pushing...
- Now, Judge,

440
00:50:45,194 --> 00:50:48,593
we don't want any harsh words
to spoil this friendly little get-together.

441
00:50:48,593 --> 00:50:50,592
JUDGE BEAN: Get-together?

442
00:50:50,692 --> 00:50:54,492
Why, this pack of weasels invade
the dignity of my courtroom,

443
00:50:55,092 --> 00:50:58,390
come in here armed with malice
aforethought to kick up a rumpus...

444
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:03,388
Now, look, you being a judge, you know
there's always two sides to any question.

445
00:51:03,688 --> 00:51:05,788
These men have come here
with a legitimate grievance.

446
00:51:05,888 --> 00:51:09,386
We're not asking you to speak
for us, Harden.

447
00:51:10,786 --> 00:51:14,984
Well, that makes it unanimous.
I'm going to talk for the both of you.

448
00:51:16,184 --> 00:51:17,984
There's a law here against fencing land

449
00:51:18,084 --> 00:51:20,982
that seems nothing short of murder
to people raising crops,

450
00:51:21,382 --> 00:51:24,380
but it's common sense
to men running cattle.

451
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:29,780
I've seen this kind of war before.
It's happening now,

452
00:51:30,678 --> 00:51:35,178
The cattlemen came in first,
then the homesteaders moved in

453
00:51:35,178 --> 00:51:39,476
They had crops for one year,
and then a dry spell, drought,

454
00:51:40,076 --> 00:51:43,774
so the homesteaders moved out,
and the rush and thistle

455
00:51:43,874 --> 00:51:46,774
And the big spaces were all broken
up by little quarter sections,

456
00:51:47,774 --> 00:51:48,972
and the homesteads left empty,

457
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:52,371
and the houses caved in,
and the land, no good for man or cattle.

458
00:51:52,371 --> 00:51:56,670
You spoiled the land,
then you came here to spoil this land.

459
00:51:56,770 --> 00:51:59,968
Yea, but it ain't big enough for cattlemen
and homesteaders, and it never will be.

460
00:52:00,068 --> 00:52:03,368
Now, clear out here. That's my ruling.

461
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:08,666
All right, Bean, we're going.

462
00:52:09,566 --> 00:52:12,164
We're going back to build our fences.

463
00:52:12,364 --> 00:52:16,264
If you do, you better build coffins
along with them. Now, get.

464
00:53:06,746 --> 00:53:08,944
You sure told them off, son.

465
00:53:09,944 --> 00:53:14,044
Yep, and now I'm going to tell you off.
I'm sorry I stopped them

466
00:53:14,144 --> 00:53:16,142
They got a right
to defend their homesteads.

467
00:53:16,342 --> 00:53:18,942
You know this ain't homestead land.
You just said so yourself.

468
00:53:19,042 --> 00:53:22,340
- The government didn't say so.
- I'm the government here.

469
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,540
Judas Priest, I don't see how you can
talk up for scum like that.

470
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,738
They proved up on their land,
and they got deeds to it.

471
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:31,836
When you make war on them,
you're making war

472
00:53:32,336 --> 00:53:33,936
Those people were starved out last year.

473
00:53:33,936 --> 00:53:36,936
I heard about those cattle being
stampeded over their crops,

474
00:53:37,036 --> 00:53:39,934
and there's too many strays running loose
in that valley right now,

475
00:53:40,234 --> 00:53:42,234
only they're not strays.

476
00:53:43,533 --> 00:53:45,332
What do you want me to do?
Arrest them cattle,

477
00:53:45,332 --> 00:53:48,632
and fine them a couple dollars apiece
for trespass?

478
00:53:49,232 --> 00:53:50,530
Now, look,

479
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:56,028
those people don't take up much room
with their little shirt-sized pieces of land.

480
00:53:56,628 --> 00:54:00,028
Why don't you be a real judge
for all of the people?

481
00:54:00,728 --> 00:54:04,226
Why don't you try to see their side of it,
and help them instead of fight them?

482
00:54:05,226 --> 00:54:07,924
Make peace around here instead of war.

483
00:54:08,624 --> 00:54:12,922
There's plenty of room for everybody,
then everybody'd look up to you.

484
00:54:15,322 --> 00:54:19,620
And then someday, maybe they'd put up
a statue out there in the street,

485
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:25,518
a statue with a carving on it.
"To Roy Bean, the real judge."

486
00:54:28,118 --> 00:54:30,718
What are you doing? Catching a fish?

487
00:54:31,816 --> 00:54:35,416
I guess I'm wasting my time.
Hold on, wait a minute.

488
00:54:35,516 --> 00:54:38,414
- No!
- You promised. We drank on it.

489
00:54:39,514 --> 00:54:41,613
I didn't have to write it.
I had it on me all the time.

490
00:54:41,714 --> 00:54:44,912
You did?
Well, why didn't you give it to me then?

491
00:54:45,212 --> 00:54:50,110
You old bullhead, if I'd have given it
to you, you'd have hung me.

492
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:53,808
- I might've at that. Let's have a look at it.
- I haven't got it with me.

493
00:54:53,808 --> 00:54:58,308
Suffering, bleeding Chickamauga!
Where's it at?

494
00:54:58,508 --> 00:54:59,906
- How is she?
- Huh?

495
00:55:00,006 --> 00:55:02,906
- I'll ride right over with you.
- No, no.

496
00:55:03,106 --> 00:55:05,804
You mean you're gonna crawfish?
You ain't going to give it to me?

497
00:55:05,904 --> 00:55:08,504
- Sure, I'll give it to you.
- When?

498
00:55:08,704 --> 00:55:11,503
When the last steer's out of the valley.

499
00:55:11,602 --> 00:55:13,702
All right, I'll pass the word around
to the boys.

500
00:55:13,802 --> 00:55:16,402
No, you don't.
You're going to help run those cattle out,

501
00:55:16,501 --> 00:55:19,800
and I'm going along
with you to see that it's done.

502
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Don't you trust me, Cole?

503
00:55:23,299 --> 00:55:25,098
When I was a kid, I had a pet rattlesnake.

504
00:55:25,198 --> 00:55:28,596
I was fond of it,
but I wouldn't turn my back on it.

505
00:55:29,896 --> 00:55:31,496
(LAUGHING)

506
00:55:31,596 --> 00:55:33,196
You're all right.

507
00:55:33,696 --> 00:55:37,394
I'm going back now,
and gathering my stuff for the roundup.

508
00:55:39,292 --> 00:55:42,892
- And that lock of hair.
- Yeah, yeah, the lock of hair.

509
00:55:55,888 --> 00:55:57,586
WADE: He defended Bean.
He said he was right.

510
00:55:57,886 --> 00:56:00,786
Said the homesteaders spoiled this land
for the cattlemen. We all heard it.

511
00:56:00,886 --> 00:56:04,384
JANE ELLEN: I don't care what you heard.
He couldn't be two-faced.

512
00:56:05,384 --> 00:56:09,982
If he took Bean's part,
he only did it to stop trouble.

513
00:56:11,482 --> 00:56:14,382
looks like every time I get into trouble,
you always speak up for me.

514
00:56:14,482 --> 00:56:16,880
They're trying to tell me
you spoke up for Bean.

515
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:21,279
Well, I did try to tell them
Bean's point of view.

516
00:56:21,279 --> 00:56:22,778
There you are.

517
00:56:23,578 --> 00:56:25,878
It's always been my experience

518
00:56:25,878 --> 00:56:29,276
that when you know the other fellow's
point of view, you usually get together.

519
00:56:29,976 --> 00:56:33,874
Well, why didn't you tell him
our point of view?

520
00:56:35,274 --> 00:56:38,174
You won't have
to patrol your fields any longer.

521
00:56:38,272 --> 00:56:40,272
Judge gave me his word they'd round up
all cattle in this valley

522
00:56:40,372 --> 00:56:42,572
and take them out of here.
(WADE SCOFFS)

523
00:56:42,672 --> 00:56:44,870
You think he'd keep his word?

524
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:47,970
Well, I'm going along with him
to see that he does.

525
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:51,168
Well, what makes you think
we'd take your word?

526
00:56:53,268 --> 00:56:55,068
Take it or leave it.

527
00:56:56,566 --> 00:56:57,866
Harden,

528
00:56:59,366 --> 00:57:01,464
you're a sneak and a liar.

529
00:57:31,154 --> 00:57:33,054
(COUGHING)

530
00:58:31,034 --> 00:58:32,434
Miss Mathews!

531
00:58:39,332 --> 00:58:40,730
I'll be back.

532
00:58:52,926 --> 00:58:54,826
California's that way.

533
00:58:57,326 --> 00:59:00,124
I got something to tell you before I go.

534
00:59:02,124 --> 00:59:04,422
- Well?
- How's Wade?

535
00:59:05,822 --> 00:59:08,322
He's fine, just fine.

536
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:15,518
You know,
you're not the prettiest girl I ever saw.

537
00:59:17,618 --> 00:59:20,316
Well, that's great news. Who asked you?

538
00:59:20,417 --> 00:59:23,416
But you've got the prettiest hair
I ever saw.

539
00:59:25,716 --> 00:59:28,214
Why do you like to make fun of me?

540
00:59:30,214 --> 00:59:32,312
'Cause I like you, I guess.

541
00:59:33,112 --> 00:59:38,312
- And you think my hair's pretty, huh?
- I never saw anything like it.

542
00:59:48,308 --> 00:59:51,806
- Oh, could I clip a lock?
- No, you can't.

543
00:59:53,106 --> 00:59:55,605
- Will you clip one?
- No, I won't.

544
00:59:56,304 --> 00:59:59,304
Come around here, take sides with Bean,

545
01:00:00,404 --> 01:00:03,002
and knock out my best friend, and...

546
01:00:03,102 --> 01:00:05,302
Tell you how much I like you,

547
01:00:06,702 --> 01:00:10,400
and how much I might miss you?

548
01:00:31,592 --> 01:00:33,292
- All right?
- No.

549
01:00:44,388 --> 01:00:46,288
Here, these are yours.

550
01:01:30,072 --> 01:01:32,972
Well, thanks a lot.

551
01:02:20,156 --> 01:02:21,754
WADE: Jane Ellen!

552
01:02:40,448 --> 01:02:42,148
Go on, Cole. Go on.

553
01:02:44,146 --> 01:02:49,046
Well, so I says to her...
I said, "Miss Langtry,

554
01:02:49,845 --> 01:02:54,144
"do you plan to go back to England
when you finish your American tour?"

555
01:02:54,244 --> 01:02:57,242
And she said to me... She said,

556
01:02:59,142 --> 01:03:03,240
"No." Said she loved
the United States too much.

557
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:07,040
- Yeah?
- She planned to stay here

558
01:03:08,838 --> 01:03:11,738
She told me that when she got
all through her work in the theater,

559
01:03:11,838 --> 01:03:16,736
that she wanted to settle down
someplace out here in the West.

560
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:20,834
Some quiet little place
way out on the range,

561
01:03:20,834 --> 01:03:23,634
away from all the lights and the crowds.

562
01:03:26,632 --> 01:03:29,332
She kept asking about Texas especially.

563
01:03:32,730 --> 01:03:37,128
She says that ever since she was
a little girl, she'd heard about Texas,

564
01:03:38,428 --> 01:03:42,726
and it'd always been the dream of her life
to have a home here someday.

565
01:03:43,626 --> 01:03:46,226
- She did?
- She did.

566
01:03:55,222 --> 01:03:57,722
Last herd just come in, Judge.

567
01:04:17,114 --> 01:04:18,414
Well?

568
01:04:18,914 --> 01:04:19,914
Huh?

569
01:04:25,212 --> 01:04:26,212
Oh.

570
01:05:52,482 --> 01:05:53,682
By gobs!

571
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:01,978
A lock of her own hair!

572
01:06:05,178 --> 01:06:07,376
It's kind of dark, ain't it?

573
01:06:11,476 --> 01:06:15,274
Yeah, she uses lots
of shampoo on her hair.

574
01:06:16,274 --> 01:06:18,872
It's beautiful. Beautiful.

575
01:06:21,272 --> 01:06:24,072
I'll never forget this, Cole. Never.

576
01:06:28,270 --> 01:06:30,969
- Let me see it, will you?
- What for?

577
01:06:31,668 --> 01:06:33,668
I ain't going to keep it.

578
01:06:34,368 --> 01:06:36,366
I'd like to see you try.

579
01:06:46,164 --> 01:06:49,962
- All right?
- All right.

580
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:00,558
I know how you feel, son.

581
01:07:14,154 --> 01:07:20,052
CALIPHET: Almighty God,
we offer thee thanksgiving for thy help

582
01:07:20,852 --> 01:07:23,750
Thou has poured thy blessings on our land.

583
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:28,049
Thou hast visited
the Earth and made it plenteous

584
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:31,348
Thou hast made it soft with drops of rain,

585
01:07:31,448 --> 01:07:35,046
and the land that was desolate
has become like a garden,

586
01:07:35,746 --> 01:07:39,844
and the waste places are become fenced
and are inhabited

587
01:07:40,044 --> 01:07:43,444
Thou hast made the tree of the field
yield her fruit,

588
01:07:43,444 --> 01:07:45,542
and the Earth, her increase

589
01:07:45,944 --> 01:07:51,041
Thou hast broken the bonds of our yoke
and delivered us out of the hands

590
01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:56,840
so that we shall dwell here safely,
and none shall make us afraid,

591
01:07:56,940 --> 01:08:02,937
and for this, thy divine bounty,
Oh, Lord, we thank thee. Amen.

592
01:08:03,437 --> 01:08:05,636
- HOMESTEADERS: Amen.
- Amen.

593
01:08:33,626 --> 01:08:38,024
(SINGING) One foot up
and the other foot down

594
01:08:45,722 --> 01:08:48,222
- JANE ELLEN: Here it is.
- What?

595
01:08:50,222 --> 01:08:52,220
Tell me something first.

596
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:55,720
Where do you keep my lock of hair?

597
01:08:55,819 --> 01:08:57,118
Oh, uh...

598
01:08:58,618 --> 01:08:59,817
Show me.

599
01:09:05,315 --> 01:09:07,915
Nobody can see that, not even you.

600
01:09:13,614 --> 01:09:17,711
Look, Cole, the best piece
of homestead land in the whole country.

601
01:09:20,010 --> 01:09:22,709
It used to belong to one
of the hired men that left us,

602
01:09:22,810 --> 01:09:25,708
and now it's anybody's. You just claim it.

603
01:09:27,008 --> 01:09:30,008
Yeah, that's a fine piece of land all right.

604
01:09:30,008 --> 01:09:32,106
Yeah, look at the feed
on those slopes over there,

605
01:09:32,706 --> 01:09:36,604
and that strip along the bottom is just fine
for wheat or corn.

606
01:09:38,904 --> 01:09:42,002
And, Cole, look,
that little knoll right there,

607
01:09:43,202 --> 01:09:45,502
it's just begging for a house.

608
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:53,398
- Do you know how to build a house?
- No, how?

609
01:09:56,598 --> 01:09:59,096
Well, you... You...

610
01:10:03,396 --> 01:10:05,994
Well, you have the kitchen there,

611
01:10:07,794 --> 01:10:11,992
and the bedroom over there,
and the living room right in the middle.

612
01:10:12,793 --> 01:10:16,090
It would have to have
the right things in it, too.

613
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:18,990
What sort of things?

614
01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:25,688
Oh, fires and lamplights, warm beds,

615
01:10:27,586 --> 01:10:31,686
the smell of coffee in the morning,
the sound of rain on the roof.

616
01:10:34,384 --> 01:10:37,584
Gee, that's a nice house, Jane Ellen.

620

we'll take a section of rail fence
and knock down a strip of corn.

621
01:11:24,367 --> 01:11:26,667
Maybe we can start a backfire.

622
01:11:31,966 --> 01:11:34,364

- Have you seen Jane Mathews?

631
01:16:40,958 --> 01:16:44,458
So I hereby christen this town Langtry!

No man ever gave a woman
a whole town afore, but I'm doing it,

633
01:16:53,254 --> 01:16:58,153
and from now on, this whole section's
going to bloom like the Jersey Lily herself!

634

Quiet! I ain't through yet.

635
01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:08,350
Miss Langtry's coming soon
to play a night in Fort Davis,

636
01:17:08,350 --> 01:17:11,148
and I want every legal resident
of Langtry, Texas,

637
01:17:11,248 --> 01:17:14,247
to go over and see
the godmother of this here town,

is liable to arrest for disorderly conduct,

I don't want
any of Roy Bean's friends around.

Wade Harper was right.
I didn't believe it then, but I do now.

657
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:29,480
You knew we were going to be burned out.
That's why you herded all the cattle out,

658
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:32,479
so they wouldn't be burned
with our crops.

659

No, I don't need your help. Not now.

Yeah, all right. And look
what I got to tell her when I see her.

Yep.

to know you had nothing to do with it.

a thing like that?

but I'm willing.

Yeah, that's where they get them,

how to spell my name.

01:29:09,202 --> 01:29:11,700
All right, boys, take your places.

745
01:29:20,497 --> 01:29:22,896
Hey, this is the stage entrance.

746
01:29:25,895 --> 01:29:29,994
Now, remember,
I want strict privacy all during the show.

747
01:29:46,988 --> 01:29:48,488
Third seat in.

748
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:11,980
- Pardon, sir, your seat is back here.
- No, it ain't. It's right here.

749
01:30:57,064 --> 01:31:00,164
Say, when does Miss Langtry
go on the play?

750
01:31:00,562 --> 01:31:03,062
Right after the curtain.
She's about to go up now, sir.

751
01:31:03,162 --> 01:31:05,361
- Go up?
- The curtain, sir.

752
01:31:21,355 --> 01:31:22,556
Now?

753
01:31:23,854 --> 01:31:25,554
Yes, now.

754
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:30,352
Now.

755

(ORCHESTRA PLAYING OVERTURE)

756
01:31:56,644 --> 01:32:00,042
Don't make a move, Judge.
I'm coming down to get you.

757
01:32:01,342 --> 01:32:02,842
Come shooting.

(GUN FIRING)

759
01:32:37,229 --> 01:32:40,628
- The war's on.
- Yeah.

760
01:32:40,928 --> 01:32:44,126
- I bet the judge is having a good time.
- Yeah.

(GUN FIRING)

762
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:05,198
Hey!

763
01:34:06,799 --> 01:34:09,698
Let's you and me stand up
and shoot it out.

764
01:34:11,096 --> 01:34:12,896
That suits me, Judge.

765
01:34:14,696 --> 01:34:17,494
JUDGE BEAN: Put up your gun. We'll draw.

766
01:34:17,694 --> 01:34:19,294
COLE: All right.

767
01:34:24,893 --> 01:34:26,692
- Ready?
- Yeah.

768
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:03,878
Now, you see what you done?

769
01:35:05,078 --> 01:35:06,878
You stopped the show.

770
01:35:07,278 --> 01:35:09,277
I was going to see Lily.

771
01:35:14,076 --> 01:35:16,174
Now it's too late.

772
01:35:16,874 --> 01:35:18,674
No, it isn't, Judge.

773
01:35:19,373 --> 01:35:22,172
She's back there now, waiting to see you.

774
01:35:24,972 --> 01:35:26,072
What?

775
01:35:27,172 --> 01:35:32,369
She knows all about you, Judge.
She wants to meet you.

776
01:35:35,068 --> 01:35:37,568
Come on, let's go back and see her.

777
01:35:44,266 --> 01:35:45,464
My hat.

778
01:36:14,154 --> 01:36:15,954
Where's Miss Langtry?

779
01:36:16,754 --> 01:36:18,753
Put me down. I can walk.

780
01:36:19,853 --> 01:36:22,752
Put me down, I tell you. That's my ruling.

Look!

See, what did I tell you?
They're coming back.

789
01:38:44,802 --> 01:38:46,602
Wagons by the score.

790
01:38:47,902 --> 01:38:49,800
It's the promised land.

792
01:38:52,900 --> 01:38:56,398
someday, Texas is going to be
the biggest and the finest...
