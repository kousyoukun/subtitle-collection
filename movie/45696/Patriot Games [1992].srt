1
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:45,958
We can't come to the phone right now.
Please leave a message.

2
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:51,701
Hi, it's Jack. We're going
to leave London as planned.

3
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:55,307
We'll take a cab from the airport
so don't pick us up.

4
00:02:57,212 --> 00:03:01,740
Eight! One, two, three ...

5
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:08,314
You already own that.
You own everything.

6
00:03:08,524 --> 00:03:15,453
We forgot about Sally's goldfish.
Feed them if they're still alive.

7
00:03:15,664 --> 00:03:18,428
Mom can make my move.

8
00:03:18,634 --> 00:03:24,470
lf they're not, go to the store
and find a couple the same size.

9
00:03:24,673 --> 00:03:28,336
We'll see you soon. Bye.

10
00:03:28,544 --> 00:03:31,172
What's happening?

11
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,340
- Yes!
- No! Another hotel?

12
00:03:37,453 --> 00:03:43,414
- What does he owe you?
- You owe me Ј1 ,100.

13
00:03:43,626 --> 00:03:48,256
l haven't got it. l'm out.
l want to go to sleep.

14
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:03,238
- Good evening, sir.
- Yes?

15
00:04:03,446 --> 00:04:05,971
Will these do?

16
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,015
Yeah, bring them in.

17
00:04:11,855 --> 00:04:14,790
My wife ... l guess.

18
00:04:35,078 --> 00:04:39,981
Candles, champagne ...

19
00:04:40,183 --> 00:04:46,384
- l'm sorry l didn't think of this.
- lt's okay, only one of us had to.

20
00:04:48,926 --> 00:04:51,656
ls she asleep?

21
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:05,234
- What about your speech?
- l'll wing it.

22
00:05:05,443 --> 00:05:08,935
Are you sure?

23
00:05:14,986 --> 00:05:21,653
We have all watched in awe at
the events taking place in Moscow.

24
00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:25,625
And at the enormous changes
resulting from these events.

25
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:30,267
ln this volatile climate,
we can only speculate -

26
00:05:30,468 --> 00:05:34,268
- on the future
of Soviet Fleet development.

27
00:05:34,472 --> 00:05:40,309
l would like to thank the Royal Navy
for inviting me here today.

28
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:51,273
He's impressed, but he can't show it.
He's a professional soldier.

29
00:06:51,484 --> 00:06:54,544
Come on, we've got to meet Daddy.

30
00:06:55,488 --> 00:06:57,979
l'm impressed.

31
00:07:05,264 --> 00:07:08,631
- Can you find it?
- Yeah, we're here.

32
00:07:08,835 --> 00:07:12,862
When we get to this street,
we turn left ... no, right.

33
00:07:13,072 --> 00:07:18,010
Are you sure?
Okay, we're going to turn right.

34
00:07:31,225 --> 00:07:34,752
Mind yourself, Paddyboy.
Move sure and fast.

35
00:07:34,962 --> 00:07:39,558
- You've told me that.
- l'm telling you again.

36
00:07:39,766 --> 00:07:43,668
This won't be like anything
you've done before, little brother.

37
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,704
Targetleaving the palace now.

38
00:07:46,907 --> 00:07:50,775
Stay awake, lads. Here they come.

39
00:08:29,317 --> 00:08:31,285
There's Daddy.

40
00:08:42,163 --> 00:08:44,358
Go!

41
00:08:47,835 --> 00:08:50,303
Get down!

42
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:57,973
Get down!

43
00:09:06,422 --> 00:09:09,755
Get down. Keep her down.

44
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:21,801
Get out of the car! Get out!

45
00:09:23,405 --> 00:09:27,068
Open the fucking door!

46
00:09:28,677 --> 00:09:31,646
Open it or l'll blow you up.

47
00:09:45,795 --> 00:09:48,355
Come on, let's go.

48
00:09:48,565 --> 00:09:51,193
Go! Go!

49
00:09:57,207 --> 00:10:00,574
Paddy?.

50
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:11,352
Stop! Army! Drop it!

51
00:10:33,743 --> 00:10:37,180
What about the boy?.

52
00:10:39,717 --> 00:10:43,153
He's had it.

53
00:11:01,605 --> 00:11:05,302
lt's all right, sweetie. Stay here.

54
00:11:10,448 --> 00:11:16,011
- Stand back, ma'am.
- That's my husband. l'm a doctor.

55
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,486
Jesus! What were you thinking of?

56
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,190
l'm going to set you down.

57
00:11:26,398 --> 00:11:31,495
Stay with me, Jack. You hear me?

58
00:11:31,703 --> 00:11:35,366
Jack ... Stay with me.

59
00:11:48,854 --> 00:11:54,554
There's a feeling of outrage over
this attack on the Royal Family.

60
00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:00,289
No group has yet claimed credit,
but one is under strong scrutiny.

61
00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:02,399
The lRA.

62
00:12:02,601 --> 00:12:07,334
According to eyewitness accounts,
Lord William Holmes, -

63
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:13,000
- the MinisterforNorthern lreland,
along with his wife and son, -

64
00:12:13,211 --> 00:12:18,275
- were saved by an American tourist,
John Patrick Ryan.

65
00:12:22,622 --> 00:12:27,924
An author andprofessor at the
NavalAcademy in Maryland, -

66
00:12:28,127 --> 00:12:31,153
- Ryan is
a former Marine Lieutenant.

67
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:38,566
He was wounded and is underguard
at an undisclosed London hospital.

68
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:42,138
Deborah Weston,
CNN News, London.

69
00:13:00,426 --> 00:13:03,554
- l'm sorry.
- lt's all right.

70
00:13:03,763 --> 00:13:07,928
You're alive. l forgive you.
otherwise ...

71
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,204
Hey, pumpkin.

72
00:13:19,813 --> 00:13:23,214
l love you.

73
00:13:24,017 --> 00:13:27,214
l love you, too.

74
00:13:33,727 --> 00:13:39,825
Can you dignify their cowardice
with your silence? They left you.

75
00:13:40,033 --> 00:13:46,836
They drove off without you.
What is it you think you owe them?

76
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,101
lf any of my mates
left me in your hands, -

77
00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:56,944
- l'd feel no great sense
of loyalty. l'd kill them.

78
00:13:58,853 --> 00:14:01,845
Who are they, Sean?

79
00:14:03,491 --> 00:14:07,484
Where are they?.

80
00:14:07,695 --> 00:14:13,190
The trip was unscheduled, but you
knew Lord Holmes would be there.

81
00:14:23,578 --> 00:14:28,106
l can't help you
if you don't talk to me.

82
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:44,125
l'd tear your heart out
if l didn't know you'd enjoy it.

83
00:14:44,332 --> 00:14:47,928
You Fenian bastard.

84
00:14:55,344 --> 00:14:59,280
No, not in all eternity.
He'll not chirp a word.

85
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:04,646
Not Sean Miller. Not while
his brother's lying on a slab.

86
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:12,522
- Don't you believe it, Jimmy?.
- l don't believe the entire thing.

87
00:15:12,728 --> 00:15:18,564
The Royal Family,
that only turns people against us.

88
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:31,138
This was totally unauthorised.
The brigade know you were behind it.

89
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:36,217
Fuck the lRA! All these years of war
and they've got us nowhere.

90
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:41,686
England is still a monarchy,
and that is where we must strike.

91
00:15:41,891 --> 00:15:45,725
The Royals and the ruling class.

92
00:15:48,231 --> 00:15:52,725
You're either with us
or you're against us.

93
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:59,403
- Make up your mind.
- l'm with you.

94
00:16:00,944 --> 00:16:03,640
Good, that's all l wanted to hear.

95
00:16:10,954 --> 00:16:14,390
l'll leave you to it.

96
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:21,755
Kevin. Charlie's going to drop by
to straighten things out.

97
00:16:21,965 --> 00:16:27,700
Be smart. Talk to him
and hold your temper.

98
00:16:29,306 --> 00:16:32,400
l promise. Thanks, Jimmy.

99
00:17:49,221 --> 00:17:51,189
Kevin!

100
00:18:02,801 --> 00:18:06,260
Kevin, it's Charlie.

101
00:18:30,296 --> 00:18:33,129
That's me holding my temper.

102
00:19:05,566 --> 00:19:09,798
- Damn! l forgot.
- What?

103
00:19:10,003 --> 00:19:12,665
Where's my bag?

104
00:19:12,873 --> 00:19:16,309
You're not going to make me wear
a rubber?.

105
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:21,311
- The church says it's a sin, darling.
- So's this, darling.

106
00:19:58,152 --> 00:20:02,179
What can you tell me about this guy?.

107
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:08,022
He's a nice boy. Sean Miller.
He shot a priest in Derry.

108
00:20:08,229 --> 00:20:13,132
lt was during confession. He thought
he was informing for the British.

109
00:20:13,334 --> 00:20:17,293
lt's not in Mr Ryan's best
interests, nor the prosecution's, -

110
00:20:17,505 --> 00:20:21,532
- to discuss matters
not directly at hand.

111
00:20:21,743 --> 00:20:28,581
lf you can confirm for me that you
disarmed that man in the square, -

112
00:20:28,783 --> 00:20:31,445
- we'll be through.

113
00:20:31,653 --> 00:20:37,115
- l can.
- Do you have anything to add?

114
00:20:37,326 --> 00:20:42,025
Yes. The man l killed
was Miller's ... brother.

115
00:20:42,231 --> 00:20:49,694
Patrick ... not even 1 7. He was
recruited by Sean into the lRA.

116
00:20:49,905 --> 00:20:53,807
Try to preserve the clarity
of your eventual testimony.

117
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:57,740
- l read it in a newspaper.
- Refrain from reading newspapers.

118
00:20:57,947 --> 00:21:02,509
Not even Doonesbury?.

119
00:21:02,718 --> 00:21:06,620
Do you have anything to add?

120
00:21:06,822 --> 00:21:08,483
No.

121
00:21:33,516 --> 00:21:37,680
My name's Geoffrey Watkins.
Private secretary to Lord Holmes.

122
00:21:37,887 --> 00:21:41,687
lt's a pleasure to meet you.
This is my wife, Catherine.

123
00:21:41,891 --> 00:21:44,257
Dr Ryan, how is your patient?

124
00:21:44,461 --> 00:21:48,591
Just fine, we're looking forward
to going home, though.

125
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:52,393
- May l introduce his lordship?
- Hello.

126
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:56,561
lt's my great honour
to finally meet you.

127
00:21:56,773 --> 00:22:02,336
l owe you a debt of gratitude
that l shall never be able to repay.

128
00:22:16,694 --> 00:22:20,824
l'm delighted you're here
to share in the good news, Mrs Ryan.

129
00:22:21,032 --> 00:22:27,460
Her Majesty has decided to invest
your husband with a knighthood.

130
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,641
My congratulations ... Sir.

131
00:22:32,843 --> 00:22:35,937
Good luck today.

132
00:22:38,516 --> 00:22:41,485
Sir Jack!

133
00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:45,188
Lady Catherine!

134
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:57,527
lf l'd had time to think, l'd have
preferred to do something else.

135
00:22:57,735 --> 00:23:03,503
You're saying you didn't have time,
so you didn't?

136
00:23:03,707 --> 00:23:09,669
- Didn't what?
- You didn't think. lsn't that it?

137
00:23:09,881 --> 00:23:18,448
No, you raced into a situation
of which you had no understanding -

138
00:23:18,657 --> 00:23:23,594
- and attacked my client, who was
a pedestrian also hurrying to help.

139
00:23:23,795 --> 00:23:28,562
- Wearing a ski mask?.
- You shot another man in the chest.

140
00:23:28,767 --> 00:23:33,261
- After they shot me.
- And felled a second victim.

141
00:23:33,472 --> 00:23:36,498
l used that force
l deemed necessary.

142
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:44,774
l should say so. l doubt very much
if anyone would disagree.

143
00:23:44,983 --> 00:23:49,943
l didn't make this happen ...
He did.

144
00:23:50,155 --> 00:23:54,421
There is one more question.

145
00:23:54,626 --> 00:24:00,623
Are you still in the paid service
of the ClA?

146
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:04,394
Remember you're under oath.

147
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,141
- No.
- l beg your pardon?

148
00:24:10,343 --> 00:24:12,971
No!

149
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:15,704
That's all, thank you.

150
00:24:15,915 --> 00:24:19,316
The witness may stand down.

151
00:24:21,954 --> 00:24:24,354
Thank you.

152
00:24:27,493 --> 00:24:30,621
Bloody proud of yourself,
aren't you?

153
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:35,290
You stuck your nose in, and
now you've killed my baby brother.

154
00:25:24,818 --> 00:25:26,843
Hey, Daddy.

155
00:25:37,031 --> 00:25:41,195
Wow, you guys have really grown.

156
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,789
- How are you feeling?
- Not so good.

157
00:26:09,998 --> 00:26:13,126
- Are you tired?
- No.

158
00:26:13,334 --> 00:26:19,068
- l have no idea what time it is.
- You're telling me.

159
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:27,472
- Did l miss something?
- No ... but l did.

160
00:26:31,553 --> 00:26:34,716
l'm pregnant.

161
00:26:35,991 --> 00:26:39,017
Honey!

162
00:26:41,697 --> 00:26:45,827
Can l watch some TV?
l'm not at all tired.

163
00:26:48,404 --> 00:26:51,134
What?

164
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:54,503
Plates.

165
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:58,407
- Do l have any say in this?
- Sure, this is a family.

166
00:26:58,614 --> 00:27:02,675
- Everyone has a say.
- But my say is after the fact.

167
00:27:02,885 --> 00:27:07,083
- Or am l wrong?
- No, you're right.

168
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:11,487
Michaela despises her little sister.

169
00:27:11,694 --> 00:27:17,429
Well, it could be even worse.
lt could be a baby brother.

170
00:27:17,634 --> 00:27:20,262
Oh no! Boys!

171
00:27:23,406 --> 00:27:25,738
Jack.

172
00:27:25,942 --> 00:27:30,345
Are you denying
that the lRA was behind this action?

173
00:27:30,547 --> 00:27:35,644
When the lRA carry out a campaign,
they admit to it.

174
00:27:35,852 --> 00:27:39,652
That's theirpolicy.
They'llproudlysay they did it.

175
00:27:39,856 --> 00:27:44,793
Have the lRA admitted to this?
l mean, common sense, logic ...

176
00:27:44,994 --> 00:27:48,623
Can l at least suggest some names?

177
00:27:51,468 --> 00:27:52,958
Sure you can.

178
00:28:33,177 --> 00:28:36,544
Good morning, Mr Cooley.

179
00:28:36,747 --> 00:28:39,477
And to you. How's business?

180
00:28:39,683 --> 00:28:45,349
Fine, thank you. l came upon this
first edition at an estate auction.

181
00:28:45,556 --> 00:28:48,491
Can your man restore it?

182
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:52,724
- When would you want this by?.
- Soon.

183
00:28:57,302 --> 00:29:01,329
The binder
may have some trouble with this.

184
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,008
ls that so?

185
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:07,701
l'll see what l can do.
He's not a miracle worker.

186
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:11,940
No, obviously he's not, Mr Cooley.

187
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,013
The best you can arrange then.

188
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:22,189
- Good day, Mr Cooley.
- Good day, madam.

189
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:40,141
Hello, Sean, do you mind
if l come along with you?

190
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:32,089
Although l disapprove
of the things you've done, -

191
00:30:32,298 --> 00:30:37,202
- l can't quite bring myself
to condemn you.

192
00:30:40,641 --> 00:30:46,477
l can't, because l understand
where the hatred comes from.

193
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:52,277
l more than understand it.

194
00:30:52,486 --> 00:30:58,584
But the fact is, we're very near the
darkest hole in all of Great Britain, -

195
00:30:58,792 --> 00:31:01,852
- and you still won't speak to me.

196
00:31:29,657 --> 00:31:32,592
The bridge is up.
We'llbe here forfive minutes.

197
00:31:32,794 --> 00:31:35,763
Understood.

198
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:58,610
Mobile three to Lymington ...

199
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:15,600
Open the door.
Open it or l'll kill him.

200
00:32:15,804 --> 00:32:21,174
- They've got the bridge keeper.
- Open the door.

201
00:32:21,377 --> 00:32:27,316
Should we wait until they kill him
and then open the door?.

202
00:32:34,423 --> 00:32:38,291
- Your guns.
- We are unarmed.

203
00:32:40,162 --> 00:32:43,461
Get them out.

204
00:32:48,604 --> 00:32:51,664
Lie down. Don't you fucking move.

205
00:32:51,874 --> 00:32:56,436
Did you think we'd forget about you?

206
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:05,453
lnspector Robert Highland,
this is a friend of mine.

207
00:33:05,655 --> 00:33:11,992
Tell me, what do they pay you
to turn against your own people?

208
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:15,793
Get on with it and be on your way.

209
00:33:15,999 --> 00:33:20,561
Very well,
if that's the way you feel about it.

210
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:14,653
Come on, Cath.

211
00:34:18,262 --> 00:34:24,064
- Have l got the tickets?
- They're on the fridge!

212
00:34:24,268 --> 00:34:29,171
- Dad ...
- Honey, there's plenty of time.

213
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:04,866
- Hello, Admiral.
- Jack, you know Marty Cantor.

214
00:35:05,076 --> 00:35:08,443
- How's the shoulder?.
- Not too bad.

215
00:35:11,383 --> 00:35:16,082
Something's come up.
Can we sit down and have a chat?

216
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:22,683
They were moving him to
Albany Prison on the lsle of Wight.

217
00:35:22,894 --> 00:35:29,094
- We think he's left the country.
- Let's deal in what we know.

218
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:32,998
We know he escaped in Kent,
near the Channel.

219
00:35:33,205 --> 00:35:38,405
lf he's left the country ...
Jack, are you listening?

220
00:35:38,611 --> 00:35:42,047
The chances that he'd come here,
or would try to, -

221
00:35:42,248 --> 00:35:45,547
- are so remote
l have trouble even saying it.

222
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:50,051
Yet your first instinct
was to come out here and tell me.

223
00:35:52,592 --> 00:35:55,686
Marty, excuse us a few minutes.

224
00:36:23,189 --> 00:36:27,752
l've got a few more weeks
before school starts, -

225
00:36:27,961 --> 00:36:31,761
- but l've got to prepare
a few lectures.

226
00:36:31,965 --> 00:36:36,959
Come and look at what we've got.
You might turn up something.

227
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:41,300
You're asking me
if l want to come back.

228
00:36:41,508 --> 00:36:43,476
Yep.

229
00:36:50,117 --> 00:36:54,053
We'll try and go next week.
Sorry.

230
00:36:56,189 --> 00:36:59,647
Sean Miller escaped.

231
00:37:01,295 --> 00:37:04,753
What does that mean?

232
00:37:04,965 --> 00:37:09,129
They thought l might be concerned,
but l'm not.

233
00:37:09,336 --> 00:37:14,364
The lRA's not going to follow me
over here. We talked about that.

234
00:37:14,575 --> 00:37:17,669
They're gone, that's it.

235
00:37:17,879 --> 00:37:22,111
They didn't ask you
to come back to ClA?

236
00:37:22,317 --> 00:37:26,651
- l said no.
- Just like that.

237
00:37:28,723 --> 00:37:32,215
l don't want to go back.

238
00:37:36,397 --> 00:37:40,891
- l saw them coming and l just ...
- l know.

239
00:37:41,102 --> 00:37:45,698
l can't go back to that life again,
you know?.

240
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:19,402
l bet your cell
was better than this.

241
00:38:19,608 --> 00:38:22,736
At least you had
your own toilet bowl.

242
00:38:22,945 --> 00:38:28,440
Cheer up, you've just been spared
a lifetime of hell on earth.

243
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:34,316
l don't feel like resting, laying in
the sun like a complacent tourist.

244
00:38:34,523 --> 00:38:40,018
We've got to train like soldiers
and we can't do that in lreland.

245
00:38:40,229 --> 00:38:42,720
lt's a waste of time.

246
00:38:42,931 --> 00:38:47,129
There's a difference
between laying about and laying low.

247
00:38:47,336 --> 00:38:54,539
Next time we'll post Lord Holmes
back to Whitehall in pieces, -

248
00:38:54,744 --> 00:38:58,874
- if that's what it takes to free
every lrish political prisoner.

249
00:38:59,082 --> 00:39:02,381
- That's not what l'm thinking of.
- l know that.

250
00:39:02,585 --> 00:39:06,885
What Ryan did can't be undone.
Stop thinking about it.

251
00:39:09,459 --> 00:39:11,984
l can't.

252
00:39:20,103 --> 00:39:23,664
How could something like this
have happened?

253
00:39:23,873 --> 00:39:28,970
lnspector Highland picked the day
and the route, and still they knew.

254
00:39:29,179 --> 00:39:33,548
- He had two children.
- Tragic.

255
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:40,314
SO-13 have narrowed it down to
31 people who had this knowledge.

256
00:39:40,523 --> 00:39:43,890
Five of whom are now dead.

257
00:39:44,094 --> 00:39:47,553
You should limit your appointments.

258
00:39:47,765 --> 00:39:53,362
l will not have my itinerary
dictated to me by terrorists.

259
00:39:54,772 --> 00:39:59,471
Whoever this traitor is,
they'd better pray l never find him.

260
00:39:59,677 --> 00:40:02,976
We know you'll do your best, sir.

261
00:40:24,034 --> 00:40:29,529
We don't know
ifwe're ever coming home

262
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:35,304
stand up, buckle up,
shuffle through the door

263
00:40:35,514 --> 00:40:38,108
jump out and shout Marine Corps!

264
00:40:38,316 --> 00:40:43,447
Egesta appealed to Athens
on what basis, on what grounds?

265
00:40:43,655 --> 00:40:48,558
Mr Viederman?
A bad time for you?

266
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:53,788
They said they'd be grateful.

267
00:40:53,999 --> 00:40:56,763
- Didn't they?.
- Yeah.

268
00:40:59,004 --> 00:41:02,906
''Fight our battle and the world
will fear and respect you.''

269
00:41:03,108 --> 00:41:07,568
- Athens already had respect.
- lt didn't matter.

270
00:41:07,779 --> 00:41:11,875
- Pride, sir.
- That's the real battle.

271
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:16,747
- Attention on deck.
- Attention to orders.

272
00:41:16,955 --> 00:41:19,480
l have a presentation to make.

273
00:41:20,192 --> 00:41:26,564
For service above and beyond
the call of duty of a tourist, -

274
00:41:26,766 --> 00:41:33,604
- we recognise John Patrick Ryan
with the order of the Purple Target.

275
00:41:33,806 --> 00:41:37,037
We hope that he will duck
next time, -

276
00:41:37,243 --> 00:41:42,271
- lest he become part of history
rather than a teacher of it.

277
00:41:49,255 --> 00:41:51,723
- How old is he?
- Ten.

278
00:41:51,924 --> 00:41:54,722
Plate-glass window?.

279
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:02,157
Here goes. Hi, guys.

280
00:42:06,038 --> 00:42:11,977
We may have to bump my next
appointment. This might take time.

281
00:42:12,178 --> 00:42:17,913
Yes, let's bump it.
Okay, let's do it.

282
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:23,385
You just waded on in
like John Wayne.

283
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:28,027
Why did you do it?
What were you thinking?

284
00:42:29,963 --> 00:42:36,368
- l don't know. l wasn't thinking.
- You sound like my students.

285
00:42:42,075 --> 00:42:44,441
lt pissed me off.

286
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:50,447
l couldn't just stand there
and watch them shoot those people.

287
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:55,054
lt was ... rage.

288
00:42:57,124 --> 00:43:00,116
Pure rage.

289
00:43:02,562 --> 00:43:07,660
- lt just made me mad.
- l hope you never get mad at me.

290
00:43:27,588 --> 00:43:30,614
She's late, Sean.

291
00:43:49,977 --> 00:43:56,474
She was at this dance,
and then this guy at the end ...

292
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:02,017
She's kind of cute, isn't she?

293
00:44:02,224 --> 00:44:05,125
ls she?

294
00:44:12,801 --> 00:44:15,634
Bye.

295
00:44:16,672 --> 00:44:20,108
- Hi, Mommy.
- How are you?

296
00:44:20,309 --> 00:44:22,140
Let's do it.

297
00:44:26,815 --> 00:44:29,579
Damn!

298
00:44:44,401 --> 00:44:46,835
Highway 50. West.

299
00:44:56,279 --> 00:44:59,009
Goodbye, Doctor.

300
00:46:36,281 --> 00:46:40,081
Dr Ryan! He's getting away.

301
00:46:46,725 --> 00:46:50,286
Where's Sean Miller?.

302
00:47:07,579 --> 00:47:10,878
Dr Catherine Ryan, please.

303
00:47:12,183 --> 00:47:15,017
How long?

304
00:47:16,789 --> 00:47:19,724
Come on!

305
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:51,315
This is Dr Ryan. l want the results
on the Thompson boy's retinal scan.

306
00:47:53,059 --> 00:47:56,620
Cathy, get off the phone.

307
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:10,870
- Look, Mom.
- lt's beautiful.

308
00:48:11,078 --> 00:48:16,141
l'm still holding.
l'd like to speak with Dr Sutton.

309
00:48:35,936 --> 00:48:41,306
Operator, emergency breakthrough.
The number is 555-3464.

310
00:48:41,508 --> 00:48:45,569
lt's a mobile phone, l know.
What do you mean l can't?

311
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:52,482
Faster!

312
00:49:12,373 --> 00:49:17,834
- Dr Ryan, the scan is fine.
- Great, thank you.

313
00:49:24,819 --> 00:49:27,515
Jesus!

314
00:49:35,229 --> 00:49:37,629
Hello? Jack?.

315
00:49:37,832 --> 00:49:43,270
Cath, something's happened.
ls Sally with you?

316
00:49:43,471 --> 00:49:46,339
- ls everything all right?
- Fine.

317
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:52,743
There she is.

318
00:49:55,317 --> 00:50:00,118
Get to the nearest police station
as quick as you can.

319
00:50:00,322 --> 00:50:03,814
- The police station?
- Get offthe highway.

320
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:11,127
Steady, mate.

321
00:50:12,067 --> 00:50:15,434
- Where are you now?
- Rowe Boulevard.

322
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:20,040
There's a police station
at Houston Street.

323
00:50:20,242 --> 00:50:23,769
- ls something wrong?
- No, everything's fine.

324
00:50:45,535 --> 00:50:47,765
They're gone.

325
00:52:10,221 --> 00:52:13,782
- Mr Ryan?
- Yeah.

326
00:52:15,727 --> 00:52:18,958
Your wife's okay.
She sustained a concussion.

327
00:52:19,164 --> 00:52:22,327
- She's pregnant.
- The baby's okay.

328
00:52:22,534 --> 00:52:25,867
- And my daughter?.
- Let's sit down.

329
00:52:26,071 --> 00:52:28,665
No, talk to me.

330
00:52:28,874 --> 00:52:32,867
lt's going to be a while
before we know.

331
00:52:54,232 --> 00:53:00,603
- Where's Sally?.
- She's in the recovery room.

332
00:53:00,805 --> 00:53:06,506
They're watching her.
We'll know in a few hours.

333
00:53:09,115 --> 00:53:12,573
They had to remove her spleen.

334
00:53:12,785 --> 00:53:16,152
She's in pretty bad shape.

335
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:20,659
l'm sorry.

336
00:54:08,008 --> 00:54:12,809
Here you go. Are you okay?.

337
00:54:21,521 --> 00:54:25,719
We go over to our reporter
with Paddy O'Neil.

338
00:54:25,926 --> 00:54:32,798
l'm praying for the recovery ofthe
victims ofthis senseless attack.

339
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:41,271
Sinn Fein are outraged, as are most
lrishmen, at this heinous crime.

340
00:54:41,475 --> 00:54:46,106
l want to share with Dr Ryan
our empathy and anguish, -

341
00:54:46,314 --> 00:54:49,147
- at an appropriate time.

342
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:55,880
- Was funding for the lRA ...
- The lRA are notresponsible here.

343
00:54:56,090 --> 00:55:01,790
- Theyhad nothing to do with it?
- No more questions.

344
00:55:06,868 --> 00:55:11,134
- She's going to be okay.
- Thank you.

345
00:55:12,974 --> 00:55:16,671
lt's all right. She's fine.

346
00:55:21,783 --> 00:55:24,911
Mr Ryan?

347
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:29,453
l'd like to share with you
our deep regret ...

348
00:55:32,794 --> 00:55:36,128
Mr Ryan ...

349
00:56:14,937 --> 00:56:19,704
You know the deal. You are involved.
lt's not good process.

350
00:56:19,908 --> 00:56:24,471
The victim of a crime
does not make the best analysis, -

351
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:27,878
- even if
you knew something about terrorism.

352
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:32,748
l have guys on it
who know about the lRA.

353
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:39,452
l'm not standing here with my hat
in my hand. l want back in.

354
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:43,792
Jack ...
Thank God about Sally.

355
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,833
Alice and l are so relieved.

356
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:51,063
- Have you managed any sleep?
- Not much, sir.

357
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:55,435
l'm interrupting something.

358
00:56:55,645 --> 00:57:01,174
You were telling Jack that we'd
be better off without him around.

359
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:04,114
Or something along those lines.

360
00:57:13,663 --> 00:57:17,031
Marc Spiva. Jack Ryan.

361
00:57:17,234 --> 00:57:22,171
Tony Ferro. Alex Winter.

362
00:57:24,475 --> 00:57:28,002
- Rose ...
- You look better than l expected.

363
00:57:28,212 --> 00:57:34,344
- lt's an illusion.
- lt'd have to be. Good to see you.

364
00:57:34,552 --> 00:57:40,422
We've carved a niche for you.
Here's your night-table reading.

365
00:58:26,171 --> 00:58:31,768
''Father killed by RUC ...
Belfast, 1979.''

366
00:58:40,485 --> 00:58:45,388
Good morning, sir.
Could l see some identification?

367
00:59:10,483 --> 00:59:14,977
- Did you see the game?
- Yeah, it was all right.

368
00:59:15,187 --> 00:59:19,521
For that penalty,
he was outside the area.

369
01:00:02,069 --> 01:00:06,438
- What the hell ..?
- Nobody move!

370
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,507
Get 'em up!

371
01:00:11,912 --> 01:00:14,039
Good morning.

372
01:00:14,247 --> 01:00:18,343
Kevin O'Donnell.
A long-time lRA strategist.

373
01:00:18,552 --> 01:00:21,316
He saw Timothy Miller die in 1979.

374
01:00:21,521 --> 01:00:26,151
He looked after Sean and Patrick.
lt's a recent photo.

375
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:31,696
lf we could find O'Donnell,
we'd find Miller, too.

376
01:00:31,898 --> 01:00:35,266
- Are you with me, Jack?.
- l'm just thinking.

377
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:39,964
- What about the gun?
- lt wasn't registered.

378
01:00:40,174 --> 01:00:43,473
- Son of a bitch.
- What?

379
01:00:45,747 --> 01:00:48,545
Look ...

380
01:00:49,851 --> 01:00:54,982
SO-13 gets an anonymous tip
about some bomb-making setup.

381
01:00:55,189 --> 01:01:00,855
They get the bad guys,
but who tipped them off?

382
01:01:03,398 --> 01:01:07,630
Three lRA hitmen
found dead at a farmhouse.

383
01:01:07,835 --> 01:01:12,829
That's British soldiers
getting out of hand.

384
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:17,704
No, look ... Brigade Commander
Jimmy O'Reardon.

385
01:01:17,912 --> 01:01:23,248
Ends up dead in a cheap hotel.
A professional hit.

386
01:01:23,451 --> 01:01:27,081
- Was that after the farmhouse?
- Same day.

387
01:01:27,289 --> 01:01:31,749
- Same day.
- What are you coming to?

388
01:01:35,063 --> 01:01:38,829
Jack! Where are you going?

389
01:01:39,034 --> 01:01:43,971
l'm going to throw
some water on my face.

390
01:02:41,631 --> 01:02:43,622
Excuse me ...

391
01:02:43,833 --> 01:02:48,065
l think one of us
is in the wrong room.

392
01:02:48,271 --> 01:02:50,762
lt's okay.

393
01:03:18,903 --> 01:03:21,838
- Jack!
- Get down.

394
01:03:22,039 --> 01:03:26,442
When the lRA carry out a campaign,
they admit to it.

395
01:03:26,644 --> 01:03:29,112
Get down!

396
01:03:41,458 --> 01:03:45,827
Who are we looking for here,
lRA terrorists?

397
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:51,400
Or some ultra-violent faction
of the lRA, fighting their own way.

398
01:03:51,602 --> 01:03:57,564
O'Reardon checked into an hotel
with a woman with long hair.

399
01:03:57,776 --> 01:04:00,438
Long red hair.

400
01:04:00,645 --> 01:04:07,050
This is who we're looking for.
We find her, we'll find him.

401
01:05:01,707 --> 01:05:07,441
l saw his wife and daughter die,
but she and Neddie blew it.

402
01:05:07,647 --> 01:05:11,014
Ryan's still alive.

403
01:05:11,217 --> 01:05:15,244
- They're not dead.
- What?

404
01:05:15,454 --> 01:05:19,390
They survived it.
l can't say it any plainer.

405
01:05:20,793 --> 01:05:24,524
- lt doesn't matter now.
- lt does matter.

406
01:05:36,743 --> 01:05:41,840
Americans hold their breath
every time a little girl falls down.

407
01:05:42,049 --> 01:05:45,951
You shot at one with a machine gun
on her way back from school.

408
01:05:46,153 --> 01:05:50,920
We've started the war. The Brits are
tearing apart Belfast for the lRA.

409
01:05:51,124 --> 01:05:56,585
Their American money, by denying the
hits, makes them look more guilty.

410
01:05:56,797 --> 01:06:01,996
The war is raging. When it's over,
we'll be the ones left standing.

411
01:06:02,202 --> 01:06:07,572
l let you go for Paddyboy,
but that's it!

412
01:06:09,276 --> 01:06:13,975
We've got work to do ...
and it's not in Maryland.

413
01:06:46,748 --> 01:06:49,012
Hello.

414
01:07:20,149 --> 01:07:24,711
- Yeah?
- How's the family, Ryan?

415
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:31,018
You nearly lost them, didn't you?
lt's easy to get at them.

416
01:07:31,226 --> 01:07:36,254
You should
look afteryour familybetter.

417
01:07:36,465 --> 01:07:42,335
Are you there? l understand
your little girl's feeling better.

418
01:07:42,538 --> 01:07:49,467
Losing herspleen willmake it
tough on her to fight offinfection.

419
01:07:49,678 --> 01:07:52,670
You sick son of a bitch.

420
01:07:57,486 --> 01:08:03,722
lt was him, wasn't it?
He's never going to leave us alone.

421
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:13,767
He'll never get close to us again.
All he can do is call up.

422
01:08:16,406 --> 01:08:20,365
You get him, Jack.
l don't care what you have to do.

423
01:08:20,577 --> 01:08:23,740
Just get him!

424
01:08:51,074 --> 01:08:54,340
Can l buy you a drink?.

425
01:08:55,346 --> 01:08:58,440
No ...

426
01:08:58,649 --> 01:09:02,050
Let me buy you one.

427
01:09:05,122 --> 01:09:08,182
Two whiskeys.

428
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:19,866
The lRA's not responsible
for all this, l know that.

429
01:09:20,070 --> 01:09:24,666
Are you waiting for me to agree?
lt's what l've said all along.

430
01:09:24,875 --> 01:09:29,744
You claim responsibility
for one thing, deny it for another.

431
01:09:29,947 --> 01:09:32,973
Nobody believes you anymore.

432
01:09:33,183 --> 01:09:37,017
l want to know where Sean Miller
and Kevin O'Donnell are.

433
01:09:40,724 --> 01:09:43,591
Let me try and understand this ...

434
01:09:43,795 --> 01:09:49,233
You want me to sell out
my fellow lrishmen to you?

435
01:09:49,434 --> 01:09:52,699
- You don't understand me at all.
- l think l do.

436
01:09:52,904 --> 01:09:57,773
l don't care what they've done!

437
01:09:57,976 --> 01:10:03,346
The day l sell out my own people,
l'll put a bullet through my head.

438
01:10:05,617 --> 01:10:11,681
- That's it then.
- Yes, l'm not drinking with you.

439
01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:14,757
Okay, l'll go home.

440
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:20,557
l'll call the Press and let them
film in my daughter's hospital room.

441
01:10:20,765 --> 01:10:23,825
lt'll be on the evening news.

442
01:10:24,035 --> 01:10:28,267
l don't care if it wasn't you,
and neither will anyone else.

443
01:10:28,473 --> 01:10:33,501
You'll have so little gun money,
you'll all be out throwing rocks.

444
01:10:33,713 --> 01:10:39,618
l will fucking destroy you!
l'll make it my mission in life.

445
01:10:44,423 --> 01:10:47,620
Excuse me.

446
01:10:48,728 --> 01:10:50,753
Well, lads, did you hear that?

447
01:11:17,323 --> 01:11:21,726
- The satellite's coming.
- Let's go.

448
01:11:23,095 --> 01:11:25,758
Come on!

449
01:11:29,703 --> 01:11:32,672
Get inside!

450
01:11:41,281 --> 01:11:44,978
SO-13 traced the guns
used in the Lord Holmes incident -

451
01:11:45,185 --> 01:11:48,450
- to an arms dealer
that supplies Gaddafi.

452
01:11:48,655 --> 01:11:54,423
Sean Miller was last seen in a
Zodiac heading out into the Channel.

453
01:11:54,628 --> 01:11:58,064
l checked on the freighters
that were out there that day.

454
01:11:58,265 --> 01:12:04,295
Syrian registry. lnvolved
in the Middle East arms trade.

455
01:12:04,504 --> 01:12:09,840
- Miller sailed to North Africa.
- Exactly.

456
01:12:10,043 --> 01:12:16,882
Our planes photograph 182 camps
a day in North Africa.

457
01:12:17,085 --> 01:12:23,513
Libyan bases, PLO, Red Brigade,
Action Direct, Red Army Faction ...

458
01:12:23,724 --> 01:12:27,091
But on the day
this ship docked in Benghazi, -

459
01:12:27,295 --> 01:12:31,026
- there's activity
in only nine of these camps.

460
01:12:31,232 --> 01:12:36,101
One is PLO, one Shining Path,
these seven we're not so sure about.

461
01:12:36,304 --> 01:12:39,637
- Why?.
- Our satellites ...

462
01:12:39,841 --> 01:12:46,303
The people in those camps probably
know our satellite schedules.

463
01:12:48,149 --> 01:12:53,246
Marty, unless you authorise us
to retask those satellites, -

464
01:12:53,454 --> 01:12:56,116
- so we can get a look in, -

465
01:12:56,324 --> 01:13:00,761
- we're never going to know
which camp they're at.

466
01:13:00,962 --> 01:13:06,367
Do you know how big a deal
it is to retask those satellites?

467
01:13:06,568 --> 01:13:09,594
Yeah.

468
01:13:21,550 --> 01:13:24,576
Bring up camp 18 again.

469
01:13:30,225 --> 01:13:33,217
Tighten on the camp here.

470
01:13:37,132 --> 01:13:42,092
Let's look up here.
See what we can see.

471
01:13:51,246 --> 01:13:54,648
Show me this grouping here.

472
01:14:07,964 --> 01:14:11,764
That's nothing.
Go back to the bigger picture.

473
01:14:12,635 --> 01:14:15,604
Let me see down here.

474
01:14:19,576 --> 01:14:23,171
What's that? Tighten up on that.

475
01:14:33,990 --> 01:14:36,618
Can you enhance that?

476
01:14:50,741 --> 01:14:53,107
Tits.

477
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:19,968
The SAS could take out
any one of these camps.

478
01:15:20,170 --> 01:15:25,267
Kill everybody there,
and be gone before the echo fades.

479
01:15:25,476 --> 01:15:29,139
Are you sure this is the same woman?

480
01:15:34,286 --> 01:15:37,380
Keep at it then.

481
01:15:44,029 --> 01:15:45,519
Son of a bitch.

482
01:16:09,888 --> 01:16:12,322
Hi.

483
01:16:13,425 --> 01:16:17,225
Read it again, Daddy.

484
01:16:28,274 --> 01:16:32,540
''The sun did not shine,
it was too wet to play.''

485
01:16:32,745 --> 01:16:37,205
''So we sat in the house
all that cold, wet day.''

486
01:16:47,693 --> 01:16:51,720
''l sat there with Sally.
We sat there, we two.''

487
01:16:51,931 --> 01:16:54,832
''l wish we had something to do.''

488
01:16:55,034 --> 01:16:59,801
''Too wet to go out.
Too cold to playball. ''

489
01:17:00,005 --> 01:17:04,840
''So we satin the house
and did nothing at all. ''

490
01:17:05,044 --> 01:17:10,107
''All we could do
was to sit, sit, sit. ''

491
01:17:10,316 --> 01:17:15,084
''We did notlike it,
not one little bit. ''

492
01:17:15,956 --> 01:17:19,585
''And then something went... bump. ''

493
01:18:02,068 --> 01:18:06,096
Paddy O'Neil can sleep at night.
He probably enjoys the irony.

494
01:18:06,307 --> 01:18:08,639
She's not lrish, she's English.

495
01:18:13,681 --> 01:18:19,551
This is the girl you saw
in the jeep, in the blink of an eye?

496
01:18:19,754 --> 01:18:23,212
- Yeah.
- What am l supposed to do?

497
01:18:23,424 --> 01:18:26,825
Tell SO-13 you know who she is.
Give them her picture.

498
01:18:27,028 --> 01:18:31,294
Ask them to look for her.
What do you mean, what do you do?

499
01:18:31,499 --> 01:18:37,460
You walk into a bar, half of whose
customers want you dead.

500
01:18:37,672 --> 01:18:44,009
You walk up to the lRA's bagman
and publicly threaten him.

501
01:18:44,212 --> 01:18:48,808
You're not a field man.
You are an analyst. Analyse that!

502
01:18:49,016 --> 01:18:54,478
l am not after yourjob. l'm after
the man who tried to kill my family.

503
01:18:54,690 --> 01:18:59,354
Well then, think. lf you tell O'Neil
that you're looking for a girl, -

504
01:18:59,561 --> 01:19:05,693
- and he gives you pictures of
a girl. Do you believe him?

505
01:19:07,569 --> 01:19:12,472
l didn't tell him
l was looking for a girl.

506
01:19:41,904 --> 01:19:45,397
Sarge, come and look at this.

507
01:19:59,289 --> 01:20:03,555
l'm a bit of a bookworm, not that
you'd know it to look at me.

508
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:08,959
What's your passion then?
Mysteries? Spy novels?

509
01:20:09,165 --> 01:20:14,159
- This is a rare book shop.
- Rare? Yes, so they are.

510
01:20:14,370 --> 01:20:17,931
- Can you locate the problem?
- l already have.

511
01:20:18,141 --> 01:20:22,134
The wiring in this place
dates from before the war.

512
01:20:22,345 --> 01:20:26,509
lt's what we call
in the electrical business ... rare.

513
01:20:26,716 --> 01:20:31,949
- l can fix it, but can you afford it?
- Just fix it.

514
01:20:41,098 --> 01:20:44,295
- He's seen it, hasn't he?
- l don't know.

515
01:20:46,937 --> 01:20:50,896
- He's got it.
- What do you make of this?

516
01:20:53,243 --> 01:20:58,738
l ...
l have no idea!

517
01:20:58,949 --> 01:21:01,281
Damn!

518
01:21:04,221 --> 01:21:10,023
l have to go out for a few minutes
to deliver some books.

519
01:21:10,227 --> 01:21:14,857
- Keep about your repairs.
- l'll be here all week.

520
01:22:28,340 --> 01:22:32,071
He gave me the hat.
He said, ''This is for you, my dear.''

521
01:22:32,278 --> 01:22:34,644
Damn!

522
01:22:48,794 --> 01:22:51,763
Dinner at the White House
is no problem.

523
01:22:51,964 --> 01:22:56,901
- What is the problem?
- We're running out of dates.

524
01:22:57,103 --> 01:23:00,095
We could move that to there ...

525
01:23:00,306 --> 01:23:06,143
Which would leave us the 14th.

526
01:23:06,346 --> 01:23:10,248
Check with John Ryan
about a presentation -

527
01:23:10,450 --> 01:23:13,977
- at our embassy in Washington
on the ...

528
01:23:14,187 --> 01:23:17,486
... 14th.

529
01:23:19,559 --> 01:23:24,553
Let's go over this again.
We start in Washington ...

530
01:23:29,035 --> 01:23:33,870
- Geoffrey Watkins.
- l'm trying to reach Mr Titus.

531
01:23:34,074 --> 01:23:38,534
- ls that extension 2691?
- No, this is 2619.

532
01:23:38,745 --> 01:23:41,646
l'm terribly sorry.

533
01:23:50,257 --> 01:23:55,321
- What are you doing up?
- l want to be there when she wakes.

534
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:59,330
l'll go with you
and take a cab back.

535
01:24:01,068 --> 01:24:04,663
Hello ... Yes, just a minute.

536
01:24:04,872 --> 01:24:10,606
- lt's for you, Sir John.
- Hello?

537
01:24:13,681 --> 01:24:19,677
Mr Ryan is holding a celebration.
Would you care to join them?

538
01:24:19,887 --> 01:24:23,050
- Where? At his house?
- Yes, sir.

539
01:24:26,828 --> 01:24:29,661
Why not?

540
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:43,407
We shot this
eight days ago in Berlin.

541
01:24:43,612 --> 01:24:47,480
One, two, three ...

542
01:24:47,683 --> 01:24:52,950
Four Brits travelling with him.
Light arms.

543
01:24:53,155 --> 01:24:58,252
- The heavy stuff is in the cars.
- He's German.

544
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:03,488
- ls this boring you, Sean?
- Six altogether.

545
01:25:03,699 --> 01:25:10,070
- lt'll be the same in Washington.
- Holmes will always be protected.

546
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:14,299
Four days in Washington
and one day in New York ...

547
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:17,706
... shopping.

548
01:25:30,325 --> 01:25:34,262
Yeah, two Caucasians.

549
01:25:34,464 --> 01:25:37,729
Take a look at the one with the hat.

550
01:25:39,202 --> 01:25:44,731
- His arms look a little pink.
- Sunburn. A new arrival.

551
01:26:00,556 --> 01:26:03,650
What do you think, same guy?.

552
01:26:06,095 --> 01:26:10,998
The rare-book dealer, Dennis Cooley.
He's bald.

553
01:26:13,303 --> 01:26:17,831
lt's possible there's a woman
in some of these camps.

554
01:26:18,041 --> 01:26:22,978
But with her and Cooley
in the same place ...

555
01:26:23,179 --> 01:26:28,277
... if that is Cooley, the odds
of coincidence are dropping fast.

556
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:33,578
But still,
there's no way l can be ...

557
01:26:35,626 --> 01:26:38,151
... absolutely certain.

558
01:26:38,362 --> 01:26:43,459
Jack, tell me one thing in life
that is absolutely certain.

559
01:26:46,303 --> 01:26:49,932
My daughter's love.

560
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:55,203
What l need is your best guess,
and l think l've heard it.

561
01:27:00,017 --> 01:27:02,918
Haven't l?

562
01:27:12,262 --> 01:27:16,632
The bastards took away
my book shop and my books.

563
01:27:16,835 --> 01:27:21,431
l'm sorry, you can't come.
You haven't got the training.

564
01:27:21,639 --> 01:27:26,235
- This mission will be very messy.
- l can fire a gun.

565
01:27:49,367 --> 01:27:52,768
Sorry, Dennis.

566
01:28:22,701 --> 01:28:28,298
- Where are you taking me, Marty?.
- lt's you who have taken us, Jack.

567
01:28:29,842 --> 01:28:33,175
lnto battle.

568
01:28:43,923 --> 01:28:49,691
Airborne support in target area.
ETA, 35 seconds.

569
01:29:23,163 --> 01:29:26,655
SAS team on the ground.

570
01:29:39,546 --> 01:29:42,606
Enlarge camp 18.

571
01:29:43,618 --> 01:29:47,884
Enlarge primary target.

572
01:29:54,629 --> 01:29:57,996
That is a kill.

573
01:30:09,944 --> 01:30:13,539
Targets have been neutralised.

574
01:30:22,590 --> 01:30:25,559
Airborne support approaching.

575
01:30:55,891 --> 01:30:59,122
SAS team withdrawing.

576
01:31:07,603 --> 01:31:10,936
We're passing out of visual.

577
01:31:23,453 --> 01:31:26,251
lt's over.

578
01:31:55,551 --> 01:31:59,146
Come on, honey.

579
01:32:33,023 --> 01:32:37,858
- Would your men like some coffee?
- No, thank you.

580
01:32:38,062 --> 01:32:42,328
Thank you, Miss Ryan,
for inviting us to your homecoming.

581
01:32:42,533 --> 01:32:47,971
You're a gracious host, and it's my
pleasure to make your acquaintance.

582
01:32:48,172 --> 01:32:51,164
You're welcome.

583
01:32:51,375 --> 01:32:56,642
l'll make the presentation
after dinner.

584
01:32:56,847 --> 01:32:59,816
Would you like to see it now?.

585
01:33:04,756 --> 01:33:09,693
- That's very nice.
- l already gave you one of those.

586
01:33:24,275 --> 01:33:27,733
That's your second piece of cake.

587
01:33:27,946 --> 01:33:32,508
- Where's the bathroom?
- Second door on the left.

588
01:33:32,717 --> 01:33:36,084
- More coffee?
- l'd love some.

589
01:33:36,287 --> 01:33:39,552
- Excuse me.
- Here it comes.

590
01:33:40,825 --> 01:33:43,453
Bathroom.

591
01:33:43,661 --> 01:33:48,621
- There's someone in there.
- No, that's the basement.

592
01:33:56,175 --> 01:33:59,542
- Hello.
- Jack, it's Marty.

593
01:33:59,745 --> 01:34:03,442
l thought
you'd like to know right away.

594
01:34:03,649 --> 01:34:08,552
- SAS just identified Cooley.
- What about the others?

595
01:34:08,754 --> 01:34:13,691
Pretty messy. lt'll take 48 hours
to verify the dental records.

596
01:34:13,893 --> 01:34:17,727
They're keeping right on it.

597
01:34:17,930 --> 01:34:23,527
The storm knocked the power.
l have to light some candles.

598
01:34:23,736 --> 01:34:28,036
- l'll light one foryou, too.
- Thanks, Marty.

599
01:34:30,609 --> 01:34:35,103
Forget to pay your bill, Cath?

600
01:34:35,314 --> 01:34:39,307
- ls everyone all right?
- Just fine.

601
01:34:39,518 --> 01:34:45,116
This only happens when
we have royalty over for dinner.

602
01:34:51,031 --> 01:34:54,967
- ls something wrong?
- Come with me.

603
01:34:57,204 --> 01:35:01,004
The storm would have knocked out
the lights in the boathouse, too.

604
01:35:01,208 --> 01:35:05,508
The power comes in
from the street and branches off.

605
01:35:06,546 --> 01:35:09,310
Jesus!

606
01:35:10,350 --> 01:35:14,309
This is Ryan. Any DSS agent?

607
01:35:14,521 --> 01:35:19,151
Maryland Troopers? Anyone?

608
01:35:19,359 --> 01:35:23,193
Anyone reading me?
Anybody?

609
01:35:23,396 --> 01:35:30,495
- Can l come down later on?
- You've got to get some sleep.

610
01:35:30,704 --> 01:35:33,003
Goddamn!

611
01:35:37,011 --> 01:35:41,209
- Don't tell them.
- Quite a storm.

612
01:35:45,253 --> 01:35:49,485
Take your hands off me!

How many are coming?
Where's Sean Miller?.

618
01:36:33,502 --> 01:36:36,596
Five, six ... maybe more.

Climb up on the stool.
Shine the light up there.

625
01:38:12,736 --> 01:38:15,864
God, Jack, what did you do

They're all over the place.

642
01:42:18,287 --> 01:42:22,986
How were you going to get away?.
Do l go for the other knee?

643
01:42:24,459 --> 01:42:29,158
Boats at the bottom of the cliff.
There are ropes.

644
01:42:29,364 --> 01:42:31,559
Kevin!

645
01:43:40,169 --> 01:43:43,195

- Any contact?
- They're still off the air.

650
01:45:41,026 --> 01:45:43,927
There he is!

Come on.

654
01:46:30,944 --> 01:46:35,142
He's alone.
He's leading us away from the royal.

655
01:46:35,348 --> 01:46:38,215
- Turn around.
- No.

656
01:46:38,418 --> 01:46:42,320
Turn it round.

657

658
01:46:47,427 --> 01:46:51,887

661
01:51:22,474 --> 01:51:27,606
There's no time for pancakes.
Toast or ... toast?
