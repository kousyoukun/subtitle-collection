我们会按原计划离开伦敦
We're going to leave London as planned,

8
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:52,131
我们会搭计程车回家
but we'll take a cab from the airport,

9
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:54,384
不用麻烦别人开车来接我们了
so nobody has to bother to drive in and pick us up.

10
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:57,095
- 我们需要买点东西…  - 八
- We need a light shop done. - Eight.

11
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:59,180
给家里留一点东西，牛奶、鸡蛋、面包
A few things to have in the house, milk, eggs, bread.

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

凯瑟琳想知道你是否能带回干洗衣物
Catherine wants to know if you can pick up the dry cleaning.

14
00:03:02,851 --> 00:03:04,811
那个已经是你的了 你什么都有了
You already own that. You own everything.

15
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:07,355
我们之前来不及购物
We didn't get that before we left.

16
00:03:07,564 --> 00:03:10,233
我们把莎莉的金鱼忘到九霄云外了
And listen, we completely forgot about Sally's goldfish.

17
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:12,318
假使它们还活着…
If by some miracle they're still alive,

18
00:03:12,402 --> 00:03:13,987
请你帮忙放饲料及换水
will you feed them and change the water, and...

19
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,865
让妈妈替我走一步
Um, Mom will make my move, honey.

20
00:03:17,574 --> 00:03:18,867
若已经死了，看你能不能到商店
And if they're not, will you go to the store

21
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:22,704
买到差不多的鱼？
and see if you can find a couple that are sort of the same size?

22
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:25,582
好的，一会见
Okay, we'll see you soon. Bye.

23
00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:28,167
- 一，二，三，四…  - 怎么了？
- One, two, three, four... - What's happening?

24
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:31,045
…五，六！真棒
...five, six! Yes!

25
00:03:31,588 --> 00:03:32,797
不
Oh, no.

26
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:35,717
又一间饭店？
Another hotel?

27
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:37,677
他欠你多少？
What does... What does he owe you?

28
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,015
你欠我1100英镑@
You owe me 1,100.

29
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:43,933
我没钱了，你赢了
I haven't got it. You win.

30
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:45,476
- 我出局了  - 这小女孩真有钱
- I'm out. - This girl is rich.

31
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,061
我想去睡觉了
I want to go to sleep.

32
00:03:59,282 --> 00:04:00,742
晚安，先生
Good evening, sir.

33
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:02,410
什么事？
Yes?

34
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:03,995
这些可以吗？
Will these do?

35
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:09,125
好，送进来吧
Yeah. Bring them in.

36
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,253
一定是我太太要的
My wife, I guess.

37
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:36,819
蜡烛，香槟…
Candles, champagne...

38
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:38,279
亲爱的
Oh, honey.

39
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:41,240
抱歉我没想到这个
I'm sorry, I didn't think of this.

40
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:42,659
没关系
That's all right.

41
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:44,452
我们当中有一个想到就行
Only one of us had to.

42
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:49,499
她睡了吗？
Is she asleep?

43
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:02,387
讲稿准备好了吗？
What about your speech?

44
00:05:02,637 --> 00:05:03,972
到时再即兴发挥吧
I'll wing it.

45
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:05,640
你确定？
You sure?

46
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,609
我们都非常关注着
We have all watched, I think, with a sense of awe,

47
00:05:16,693 --> 00:05:18,319
在莫斯科和各个联邦国家
the protean events which have taken place

48
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:20,321
所发生的一连串事件
in Moscow and the Republics

49
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:24,409
这些事件所引发的巨大变化
and the enormous changes resulting from these events.

50
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:26,869
在当前不稳定的政治气候下
In this volatile climate, then,

51
00:05:26,995 --> 00:05:29,372
我的结论是我们仅能限于推测
I must conclude that we can only speculate

52
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:33,126
关于苏联舰队未来的发展与部署
on the future of Soviet fleet development and deployment.

53
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:35,962
我想感谢皇家海军官校的理事
I would like to thank the trustees of the Royal Naval Academy

for their very kind invitation to be here with you today.

55
00:06:43,738 --> 00:06:46,282
他很欣赏你，莎莉，他不能表现出来
He's impressed, Sally. He just can't show it.

56
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:47,867
他是个职业卫兵
He's a professional soldier.

57
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,119
他不能被任何事干扰
It's his job not to be distracted.

58
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:53,414
走吧，我们去接爸爸
Come on. We've got to go meet Daddy.

59
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:56,000
你很了不起
I'm impressed.

60
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:06,052
找到了吗？
Find it on the map there?

61
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:07,428
- 好  - 我们在这儿
- Good. - We're right here.

62
00:07:07,512 --> 00:07:10,264
到了前面的街再向左转
And when we get to the street there, we turn left...

63
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:11,891
不，右边，对，向右
No, right. Yeah, right.

64
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:13,101
- 确定吗？  - 对，向右转
- You sure? - Turn right, yes.

65
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:15,603
那就向右转，跟着你的地图走
Okay, we're going to turn right. I'm following your map.

66
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:17,605
没问题
Okay, okay, all right.

67
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:32,703
你要多加小心，小子
You mind your bottom, Paddy-boy.

68
00:07:32,787 --> 00:07:34,163
行动要快又准
Move sure and fast.

69
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:35,832
你不是说过了吗？
You told me that, didn't you?

70
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:37,667
我再叮咛一遍
So I'm telling you again.

71
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:42,463
这次任务绝对非比寻常
This won't be like anything you've ever done before, little brother.

72
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,800
目标现在离开王宫
Target leaving the palace now.

73
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,009
好
Right.

74

大伙打起精神，他们来了
Stay awake, lads. Here they come.

75
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:24,088
这里行吗？
Okay right here?

76
00:08:24,172 --> 00:08:25,256

That good?

77
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:27,216
再近点？
Any more? Little more?

78
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:28,301
好
Okay.

79

开门，不然我就炸开
Open it, or I'll blow it off!

93
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:46,629
我们走

停下！放下武器
Stop! Army! Drop it!

救救他
Help the boy.

98
00:10:38,848 --> 00:10:40,474
他已经死了
No, he's had it.

99
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,455
没事的，宝贝，你待在这别动
It's all right, sweetie. I want you to stay here.

100
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:04,832
马上就没事了
Everything's going to be okay.

101

- 请往后站  - 退后，太太
- Stand back, please. - Stand back, ma'am.

你当时怎么想的？
What were you thinking of?

106
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:23,726
我要让你躺平，好吗？
I'm going to set you down, okay?

107

00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:53,042
我不但不会跟他们讲义气
I'd not only feel no great sense of loyalty,

144
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:55,669
还会亲手干掉他们
I'd make sure to remind meself to kill them.

145
00:13:58,005 --> 00:13:59,548
他们是谁，肖恩？
Who are they, Sean?

146
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,345
他们在哪？
Where are they?

147
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:08,557
行程是临时决定的的
The trip was unscheduled.

148
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:11,519
你们怎么知道公爵会到那里？
How did you know Lord Holmes would be there?

149
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:26,033
你不说话我就帮不了你
I can't help you if you don't talk to me, you know.

150
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,839
我会把你的心挖出来喂你吃
I'd tear your heart out and serve it up to you with chips

151
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,957
相信你一定会很享受的@
if I didn't know you'd enjoy it,

152
00:14:43,211 --> 00:14:44,920
你这个爱尔兰杂种
you Fenian bastard.

153
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:56,564
绝对不会
No. Not in all eternity.

154
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:59,775
他不会吐露半个字，肖恩・米勒不会的
He'll not chirp a word. Not Sean Miller.

155
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,778
尤其是他们杀了他弟弟
And not while his brother is lying on a slab.

156
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:09,285
怎么了，吉米？你不相信吗？
What's the matter, Jimmy? Don't you believe it?

157
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:11,996
是整件事让人难以置信
It's the entire thing I don't believe.

158
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,789
袭击王室，凯文？
The royal family, Kevin?

159
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:17,251
这只让人们更加讨厌我们
You know that only turns people against us.

160
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:26,594
而且这是擅自行动
Look, this was totally unauthorized,

161
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:30,222
其他指挥官又知道行动是你策划
and the other brigade commanders, they know that you were behind it.

162
00:15:30,306 --> 00:15:31,849
去他的爱尔兰共和军
Fuck the bloody IRA.

163
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:35,102
这么多年来一事无成
All these years of war, and they've got us nowhere.

164
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,981
英格兰骨子里，仍是一个君主国
In its heart and soul, England is still a monarchy,

165
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,758
为此我们必须打击
and that is where we must strike,

166
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:43,724
皇室和统治阶层
at the royals and the ruling class.

167
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:50,451
你如果不支持我们就是与我们为敌
You're either with us or you're against us, Jimmy-boy.

168
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:54,705
自己决定吧
Make up your mind.

169
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:58,334
我当然支持你们
Oh, I'm with you.

170
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:02,671
好，我就是想听你这句话
Good. That's all I wanted to hear.

171
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:12,014
我就不打扰你了
I'll leave you to it.

172
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:15,476
凯文…
Kevin...

173
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,212
查理今晚要过来@
Charlie's going to drop by tonight

174
00:16:18,297 --> 00:16:20,480
跟你把事情讲清楚
to try to straighten things out.

175
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:23,317
聪明点，跟他谈谈
Be smart. Talk to him.

176
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:26,487
控制一下脾气
And hold your temper.

177
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:30,032
我答应你
I promise.

178
00:16:30,366 --> 00:16:31,867
多谢你，吉米
Thanks, Jimmy.

179
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,279
凯文
Kevin.

180
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:04,251
凯文，是我，查理
Kevin, lad, it's me, Charlie.

181
00:18:29,485 --> 00:18:32,154
这是我控制脾气的方式，吉米
That's me holding my temper, Jimmy-boy.

182
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,832
上帝
Oh, God.

183
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,460
哦
Oh, yeah.

184
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,045
真好
All right.

185
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,343
真好
All right.

186
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:58,222
嗯
Oh, yeah.

187
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:06,230
- 糟糕  - 怎么？
- Oh, damn! - What?

188
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:07,815
- 我忘了  - 什么？
- I forgot. - What?

189
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:10,484
我的皮包在哪？
Where's my bag?

190
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,696
你不会是要我戴保险套吧？
You're not going to make me wear a rubber, are you?

191
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:18,450
你没听教会说那是一种罪吗？
You know, the church says wearing one of them's a sin, darlin'.

192
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:20,285
没错，亲爱的
So is this, darlin'.

193
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,225
（欧代尔酒店）

194
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:58,866
关于这个人…
So, what can you tell me about...

195
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:01,702
你了解多少？
About this guy?

196
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:05,038
肖恩？他是个好家伙
Sean? Oh, he's a nice boy, Sean Miller.

197
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:07,457
在德里杀过一个神父
Shot a parish priest in Derry,

198
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,626
而且是在告解的时候
during confession, if you can imagine.

199
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,461
他以为神父是线人…
He thought the Father was informing for the British...

200
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:12,504
抱歉，警官
Excuse me, Sergeant.

201
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:16,341
我觉得对雷恩先生以及控方都没有任何好处
I don't think it's in Mr. Ryan's best interests or the prosecution's

202
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:20,262
就是讨论和案情没有直接关联的事情
to discuss matters not directly related to the events at hand.

203
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:25,100
你只要跟我确认照片中的人
If you can confirm for me that the man in that photograph

204
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:27,895
就是广场上被你制服的人
is the same man you disarmed in the square,

205
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:29,730
我们就问完了
I think we'll be through.

206
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:31,732
就是他
I can.

207
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,944
你还有什么要补充的吗？
Do you have anything to add, Mr. Ryan?

208
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:37,446
有
Yes.

209
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:41,325
- 我打死的是米勒的…  - 弟弟
- The man I killed was Miller's... - Brother.

210
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:42,951
- 弟弟  - 帕特里克
- Brother. - Patrick.

211
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:45,329
这小子还未满17岁
Not even 17, Paddy-boy.

212
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:48,624
肖恩让他加入爱尔兰共和军…
Recruited by Sean into the IRA...

213
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:50,334
你最后的证词…
Again, I think we'd all be better served

214
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:52,878
要尽量清楚扼要
if we could preserve the clarity of your eventual testimony.

215
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:54,546
我从报纸上得知…
I read it in the newspaper. I can hardly see...

216
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,549
请不要看任何报纸
I'd appreciate you refraining from reading the newspapers.

217
00:20:57,633 --> 00:20:59,134
连环漫画都不能看？
Not even Doonesbury?

218
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,097
还有要补充的吗？
Do you have anything to add?

219
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:06,975
没有了
No.

220
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,644
（恐怖分子审讯）

221
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:31,708
在那边，先生

222
00:21:32,668 --> 00:21:33,752
- 雷恩先生？ - 是的
- Mr. Ryan? - Yes.

223
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:34,920
我是杰弗里・沃特金斯
My name's Jeffrey Watkins,

224
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:36,797
霍姆斯公爵的首席私人秘书
principal private secretary to Lord Holmes.

225
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,382
很高兴见到您
It's a pleasure to meet you.

226
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:39,675
- 这是我太太凯萨琳  - 您好
- This is my wife, Catherine. - How do you do?

227
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,926
您好
Hello.

228
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:43,303
雷恩医生，你的病人康复得怎么样了？
So, Dr. Ryan, how is your patient healing?

229
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:44,596
还不错
Just fine.

230
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,390
我们希望能尽快回家
We're looking forward to going home, though.

231
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:47,599
我了解
I can imagine.

232
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:49,643
这位是公爵阁下
May I introduce His Lordship?

233
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:51,061
你好
Oh, hello.

234
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:54,272
能与你见面我感到很荣幸，雷恩博士
It's my great honor to finally meet you, Dr. Ryan.

235
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:55,482
谢谢
Thank you.

236
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:59,528
您的救命之恩我无以为报
I owe you a debt of gratitude that I shall never be able to repay.

237
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:01,488
谢谢，您太客气了
Not at all. Thank you for your kind note.

238
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:19,673
真高兴你也能在此分享这个好消息，雷恩太太
I'm delighted that you're here to share in the good news, Mrs. Ryan.

239
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:23,260
女王陛下决定为你的丈夫授予爵位
Her Majesty's decided to invest your husband KCVO,

240
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:26,430
维多利亚爵士
Knight Commander of the Victorian Order.

241
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:30,892
恭喜你，爵士
My congratulations, sir.

242
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,520
- 谢谢  - 祝你今天好运
- Thank you. - Good luck today.

243
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:39,109
杰克爵士？
Sir Jack?

244
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,071
凯萨琳夫人
Lady Catherine.

245
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:54,041
如果当时我有时间考虑
Perhaps if I'd had more time to think about it,

246
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:56,585
我也许会选择采取别的方式
I would've preferred to do something else.

247
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,004
你是说你没有时间，对不对？
So you're saying you didn't have time, is that it?

248
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:00,172
对
That's correct.

249
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:01,548
所以你没有？
So you didn't.

250
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:03,842
没有什么？
Didn't what?

251
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:05,302
考虑，先生
Think, sir.

252
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:09,097
你想要表达的是你没有时间考虑
You didn't think is the point I believe you're trying to make.

253
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,620
不对
No,

254
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,217
而是你置身于一个情境之中
instead, you raced into a situation of which,

255
00:23:14,424 --> 00:23:17,100
正如你自己所言，是你自己不清楚的
by your own admission, you had no understanding,

256
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:19,691
攻击我的当事人
attacked my client,

257
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:22,778
实际上，他只是另一个匆忙上前帮忙的路人
who was, in fact, another pedestrian hurrying to help.

258
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:24,196
戴着滑雪面罩？
Wearing a ski mask.

259
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:28,116
你还击中另一个人的胸膛，这次…
Shot a second man in the chest, this one taking you, can it be...

260
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:29,367
那是在他们朝我射击之后
After they shot me.

261
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:32,537
你近距离开了三枪，打死了第二个人@@
three shots at point-blank range in order to fell the second victim.

262
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:35,499
我是迫不得已才使用武力
I used that force I deemed necessary.

263
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,251
我想是这样
I should say so,

264
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:42,923
也相信法庭内所有人都会同意
and doubt very much whether anyone in this courtroom would disagree.

265
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:44,216
对不起
Excuse me.

266
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:45,717
此事非因我而起，先生
I didn't make this happen, sir.

267
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:47,344
没有问题了
No further questions.

268
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:48,637
是他引起的
He did.

269
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:52,099
法官大人，还有一个问题
Oh, My Lord, there is one more question.

270
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:56,103
雷恩博士，你是否仍然是…
Are you still, Dr. Ryan,

271
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:59,272
中央情报局的雇员？
in the paid service of the Central Intelligence Agency?

272
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:02,484
别忘记你宣过誓
I should remind you that you're under oath.

273
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:08,156
- 不是  - 请再说清楚一点
- No. - I beg your pardon?

274
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:10,450
不是
No.

275
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,162
没有问题了，谢谢
That's all. Thank you.

276
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:17,290
证人可以退席了
The witness may stand down.

277
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:18,959
谢谢大家
Thank you very much.

278
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:21,962
谢谢
Thank you.

279
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:26,049
先生们，我想这是个适当的时机…
Gentlemen, I think this might be an appropriate moment...

280
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:28,802
你很自豪，是吧？
Bloody proud of yourself, aren't you?

281
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:32,347
你多管闲事
You stuck your nose in where it didn't belong.

282
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:35,225
还杀了我弟弟
And now you've killed my baby brother.

283
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:25,942
- 爸爸！  - 小南瓜
- Hey, Daddy! - Hey, pumpkin.

284
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:39,080
你们真的长大了很多
Wow! You guys have really grown.

285
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:06,900
感觉怎么样？
How are you feeling?

286
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:08,610
不太好
Not so good.

287
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:11,279
- 累了吗？ - 不是
- Tired? - No.

288
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:15,992
完全不知道现在是几点，感觉像是早上
I have no idea what time it is. Feels like morning to me.

289
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:17,953
那还用说
You're telling me.

290
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:22,624
我错过什么了吗？
Did I miss something?

291
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:24,167
没有
No.

292
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:26,586
但我有
But I did.

293
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:31,967
我怀孕了
I'm pregnant.

294
00:26:35,095 --> 00:26:36,137
亲爱的
Honey!

295
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:43,436
我可以看会电视吗？我一点都不累
Can I watch some TV? I'm not at all tired.

296
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:48,775
怎么了？
What?

297
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:52,153
盘子
Plates.

298
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:55,699
我有权利发表意见吗？
I don't have any say in this, do I?

299
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:57,701
当然可以，宝贝，这是家庭
Sure, you do, honey. This is a family.

300
00:26:57,784 --> 00:26:58,952
人人都能发表意见
Everybody's got a say.

301
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:00,996
但事情都已经发生了
But my say's after the fact.

302
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,331
我说错了吗？
Or am I wrong?

303
00:27:03,498 --> 00:27:04,499
没有
No.

304
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:06,167
你是对的
You're right.

305
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:10,130
米凯拉真的很讨厌她妹妹
Michaela really despises her little sister.

306
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:12,173
是吗？
Yeah?

307
00:27:12,507 --> 00:27:14,009
但事情可能会更糟
Are you ready for this? It could be even worse.

308
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:16,344
也许是个小弟弟
It could be a baby brother.

309
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:18,388
拜托，千万不要
Oh, no. Boys.

310
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:20,932
你认为这些人恐怖分子吗？
I mean, do you refer to these fighting men as terrorists?

311
00:27:21,016 --> 00:27:22,475
不，他们是爱国者
No. We call them patriots.

312
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,643
杰克
Jack.

313
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:24,728
男孩子是…
Boys are...

314
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:27,522
你是否否认这次行动…
Do you, in fact, deny that the Provisional Wing of the IRA

315
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:29,441
是爱尔兰共和军所为？
was behind this assassination attempt?

316
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,899
爱尔兰共和军会…
When the IRA...

317
00:27:31,255 --> 00:27:34,270
承认所策划的任何行动
carry out any form of campaign, they admit to it.

318
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,075
谢谢你
Thank you.

319
00:27:35,194 --> 00:27:36,383
这是政策
That's the policy.

320
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:38,570
他们会自豪地承认所作所为
They'll proudly say they did it.

321
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:41,328
爱尔兰共和军出面承认了吗？
Have the IRA admitted to this?

322
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,789
从常识、逻辑上或是种种其他原因…
I mean, common sense, logic, some form of reason...

323
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:46,249
我能建议几个名字吗？
May I at least suggest some names?

324
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:47,792
有人认为你在美国
Some think your efforts in America

325
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:50,962
为爱尔兰的筹款事业会因此受影响…
raising money for the Irish cause will be affected...

326
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:52,839
当然可以，宝贝
Sure you can, honey.

327
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:01,514
（英雄勇救皇室成员）

328
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:33,922
早上好，库利先生
Good morning, Mr. Cooley.

329
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:37,133
夫人
And to you, madam.

330
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:39,719
- 生意好吗？  - 很好，谢谢
- How is business? - Fine, thank you.

331
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:43,807
我在一次遗产拍卖会上得到这本初版书
I came upon this first edition at an estate auction.

332
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:46,226
你们师傅能修补吗？
Can your man restore it?

333
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:50,188
你想何时要？
And when would you want this by, madam?

334
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:51,272
尽快
Soon.

335
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:53,166
（米勒的押解路线和车辆配备）

336
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:55,443
这件事相当紧急
As you can see, it's very pressing.

337
00:28:56,444 --> 00:28:57,946
我不太清楚
I'm not sure.

338
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:00,365
装订师傅未必做得来
The binder may have some trouble with this.

339
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:01,616
是吗？
Is that so?

340
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:04,619
我尽力而为吧
I'll see what I can do.

341
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:06,538
你也知道他不是万能的
He's not a miracle worker, you know.

342
00:29:06,621 --> 00:29:09,457
当然，库利先生
No, obviously he's not, Mr. Cooley.

343
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:14,963
就尽力而为吧
The best you can arrange, then.

344
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:20,176
- 再见，库利先生  - 再见，夫人
- Good day, Mr. Cooley. - Good day, madam.

345
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:35,900
喂，肖恩
Hello, Sean.

346
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:38,486
你不介意我和你一起去吧？
Don't mind if I come along with you, do you?

347
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:29,704
虽然我不同意你的所作所为
Although I disapprove of the things you've done, Sean,

348
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:34,042
但我也不忍太过责怪你
I can't quite bring meself to condemn you.

349
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:41,007
我不能
I can't,

350
00:30:42,592 --> 00:30:45,386
因为我明白仇恨的来源
because I understand where the hatred comes from.

351
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:49,557
我非常明白
I more than understand it.

352
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:53,978
但我们目前是处于
But the present fact is that we're very near now

353
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:56,856
英国最黑暗的时期
the darkest hole in all of Great Britain,

354
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:00,235
你却仍不肯开口
and you still won't speak to me.

355
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:30,098
他们正在升桥
They're raising the bridge.

356
00:31:30,223 --> 00:31:32,225
我们五分钟后过去
We'll be here about five minutes.

357
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:33,726
知道了
Understood.

358
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:56,082
三号呼叫利明顿
Mobile Three, Lymington.

359
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:57,792
利明顿

360
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:00,753
他们干扰了无线电

361
00:32:10,847 --> 00:32:12,265
开门
Open the door!

362
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:14,934
不然我就杀了他
Open it, or I'll kill him.

363
00:32:15,351 --> 00:32:17,478
- 他们抓了守桥人  - 我们怎么办？
- They've got the bridge keeper. - What do we do?

364
00:32:17,604 --> 00:32:19,355
- 开门  - 开门
- We open the door. - Open it!

365
00:32:19,522 --> 00:32:21,774
- 但是我的天啊！  - 但是什么？
- But for Christ's sake! - But what?

366
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:25,278
等着他们杀了他再开门？
Wait until they kill him, then open the door?

367
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:34,662
放下你们的武器！
Your guns!

368
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:35,913
我们没有武器
We are unarmed.

369
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:37,707
你们究竟是谁？
Just who the hell are you?

370
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:40,627
带他们出来！
Get them out!

371
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:46,799
低下头！
Get your heads down!

372
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:49,677
全都趴在地上！
Lay down on the bloody ground!

373
00:32:49,886 --> 00:32:51,304
都不准动！
Don't you fucking move!

374
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:54,182
你以为我们会忘了你吗？
Didn't think we'd forget about you, did you?

375
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:55,808
感谢上帝
Honest to God.

376
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,046
罗伯特・海兰警官@
Inspector Robert Highland,

377
00:33:02,548 --> 00:33:03,980
这是我的朋友
this is a friend of mine.

378
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:06,486
我们终于见面了
We meet at last, Mr. Highland.

379
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:10,262
他们给了你多少钱让你背叛自己的同胞？
Tell me, what did they pay you to turn against your own people?

380
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:14,160
你们下手吧，好自为之
Get on with it and be on your way.

381
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:18,581
很好，就照你的意思吧
Very well, if that's the way you feel about it.

382
00:34:10,925 --> 00:34:12,218
快点，凯西
Come on, Cath!

383
00:34:17,432 --> 00:34:18,891
门票在我这里吗？
Have I got the tickets, or what?

384
00:34:18,975 --> 00:34:21,185
- 我没拿  - 我也没拿
- I don't have them. - I don't have them.

385
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:22,895
门票在冰箱上
They're on the fridge.

386
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:25,022
爸爸…
Dad...

387
00:34:25,106 --> 00:34:27,316
宝贝，时间还早得很
Honey, there's plenty of time.

388
00:34:58,097 --> 00:35:00,600
- 你好，将军  - 早上好，杰克
- Hello, Admiral. - Good morning, Jack.

389
00:35:01,642 --> 00:35:03,603
- 你认识马蒂・坎托  - 马蒂
- You know Marty Cantor. - Marty.

390
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:05,938
- 肩膀怎么样了？  - 还好
- How's the shoulder? - Not too bad.

391
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:11,861
发生了一些事情
Something's come up.

392
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,156
可以坐下来谈谈吗？
Can we sit down and have a chat?

393
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:20,411
他们正送他去怀特岛上的阿尔巴尼监狱
They were moving him to Albany Prison on the Isle of Wight

394
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:21,829
在当时
when it happened.

395
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,248
我们认为他已经离开英国了
We think he's left the country.

396
00:35:24,332 --> 00:35:25,583
容我打断一下
Marty, excuse me.

397
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:28,252
先别说未经证实的事
Let's deal in what we know, and not what we don't.

398
00:35:28,336 --> 00:35:29,504
我们知道他逃跑了
We know he's escaped.

399
00:35:29,629 --> 00:35:32,298
是在海峡附近的肯特郡
We know it happened in Kent, near the Channel.

400
00:35:32,715 --> 00:35:34,509
如果他离开了英国…
If he's left the country...

401
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,009
杰克，你在听吗？
Jack, you listening?

402
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,252
他来到这里的可能性
The chances he'd come here,

403
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:41,382
或他试图来这里的机率
that he'd try, that he could come here...

404
00:35:41,762 --> 00:35:42,877
微乎其微
are so remote,

405
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:45,061
毋庸置疑的
I have trouble even saying it.

406
00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:46,687
但你却在第一时间
And yet your first instinct

407
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:49,357
大老远过来告诉我
was to come all the way out here and tell me.

408
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:54,487
马蒂，能单独让我们谈谈吗？
Marty, want to excuse us a few minutes?

409
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,455
还有几周才开学
I've got a few more weeks before school starts,

410
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,837
但是我必须好好研究…but I've got to dig in...

411
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:29,520
准备几堂课
and prepare a few lectures.

412
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,317
你想看看我们掌握的资料吗？
Want to come down and look over what we got?

413
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:35,695
或许你会有新发现
You might turn up something we haven't.

414
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:38,447
你在找我回去工作吗？
You're asking me if I want to come back.

415
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:42,034
对
Yup.

416
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:52,044
- 我们下周再去吧，宝贝  - 好吧
- We'll try and go next week, honey. - All right.

417
00:36:52,128 --> 00:36:53,379
对不起
Sorry.

418
00:36:55,298 --> 00:36:56,799
肖恩・米勒逃脱了
Sean Miller escaped.

419
00:37:00,386 --> 00:37:02,138
什么意思？
Well, what does that mean?

420
00:37:04,432 --> 00:37:05,850
他们只想让我知道
They just wanted me to know.

421
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:08,269
他们觉得我会担心，但我一点也不
They thought I might be concerned. I'm not.

422
00:37:08,394 --> 00:37:09,478
爱尔兰共和军没那么蠢
The IRA's not stupid.

423
00:37:09,562 --> 00:37:11,230
会一路追到美国来
They're not going to follow me all the way over here.

424
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:13,316
我们谈过，他们也赞同
We talked about it. They agreed.

425
00:37:13,608 --> 00:37:15,276
之后就离开了
They're gone. That's it.

426
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:19,322
他们没请你回中央情报局？
They didn't ask you to come back to CIA?

427
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,575
我拒绝了
I said no.

428
00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:25,453
就这样？
Just like that?

429
00:37:27,955 --> 00:37:29,957
我不想回去
I don't want to go back, honey.

430
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:37,381
当我看到他们…
I saw them coming, and I just...

431
00:37:37,465 --> 00:37:38,674
我明白
I know.

432
00:37:39,842 --> 00:37:43,679
我无法再回到那种生活，你很清楚
I can't go back to that life again, you know?

433
00:37:50,436 --> 00:37:52,271
莎莉，等等
Sally! Wait up, honey.

434
00:38:14,377 --> 00:38:16,712
我打赌你的牢房比这好
I bet your cell was even better than this,

435
00:38:16,796 --> 00:38:18,589
跟这比起来就像饭店
the bloody Ritz in comparison.

436
00:38:18,673 --> 00:38:21,717
至少你有自己的马桶吧？
At least you always had your own toilet bowl, eh, Sean?

437
00:38:21,801 --> 00:38:22,969
来吧，肖恩，开心点
Come on, Sean, cheer up.

438
00:38:23,052 --> 00:38:25,346
起码你下半生不用待在监狱
You've just been spared a lifetime of hell on earth.

439
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:27,515
或说一、两句感激的话
A word of gratitude might even be in order.

440
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,350
我不想休息
I don't feel like resting,

441
00:38:30,476 --> 00:38:33,312
像个游客一样做日光浴
laying around in the sun like some complacent tourist.

442
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:35,898
若我们要建立军队，就要像士兵一样训练
If we're to build an army, we've got to train like soldiers.

443
00:38:35,982 --> 00:38:38,401
在爱尔兰办不到，现在不行
We can't do that in Ireland. Not now.

444
00:38:39,986 --> 00:38:41,404
真浪费时间
Bleeding waste of time.

445
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:43,656
伺机而出和无所作为
There's laying about, and there's laying low.

446
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:45,032
是有区别的
There's a difference.

447
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:46,117
是吗？
Is there?

448
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,284
霍姆斯公爵
It's Lord Holmes

449
00:38:47,368 --> 00:38:49,245
才不应该过于自满
who should be worried about complacency.

450
00:38:49,704 --> 00:38:51,622
下次他就没那么走运了
Next time, he won't be so lucky.

451
00:38:51,706 --> 00:38:53,749
把他剁成肉酱寄到白厅
Post him back to Whitehall in little pieces,

452
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:57,712
逼他们释放每所有爱尔兰政治犯
if that's what it takes to free every Irish political prisoner.

453
00:38:57,878 --> 00:38:59,839
我想的不是他
That's not who I'm thinking of.

454
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,230
我知道，肖恩@
I know that, Sean,

455
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,380
但雷恩做的事已无法改变
but what Ryan done can't be undone,

456
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:05,886
你就别想他了
so you should stop thinking about him.

457
00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:09,890
我做不到
I can't.

458
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:22,528
这事情究竟是怎么发生的？
How in the world could something like this have happened?

459
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:24,739
海兰警官定的时间
Inspector Highland picked the day,

460
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:26,741
路线和押送人员都是他挑的
picked the decoy routes, picked the men,

461
00:39:26,866 --> 00:39:27,992
但行动还是曝光
and still they knew.

462
00:39:28,075 --> 00:39:30,119
他有两个孩子
He had two children, apparently.

463
00:39:30,286 --> 00:39:32,580
真是个悲剧
It's tragic, tragic.

464
00:39:32,872 --> 00:39:34,957
英国反恐部队已将范围缩小到31人
SO13 have narrowed it down to 31 people

465
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:38,252
即可能知道您被袭那天的行程
who had prior knowledge of your itinerary on the day of the attack,

466
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:40,087
及米勒押送资讯的人员
and of Miller's transfer,

467
00:39:40,713 --> 00:39:42,423
其中五个已经死了
five of whom are now dead.

468
00:39:42,965 --> 00:39:44,467
公爵，我认为从现在起
Sir, I think it might be best

469
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,677
您该尽量减少活动
if we limit your appointments for the time being.

470
00:39:46,761 --> 00:39:50,389
我不会让恐怖分子来控制我的行程
I will not have my itinerary dictated to me by terrorists.

471
00:39:53,934 --> 00:39:55,603
无论叛徒是谁
Whoever this traitor is,

472
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:58,481
他最好向上帝祈祷永远不要被我找到
they'd better pray to God I never find him.

473
00:39:58,564 --> 00:40:01,233
我们知道你会尽力而为
We know you'll do your best, Sergeant.

474
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:20,836
（美国海军官校，马里兰州安纳波利斯）

475
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:25,758
不知道能不能回家
And we don't know if we're ever coming home

476
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:28,928
不知道能不能回家
And we don't know if we're ever coming home

477
00:40:29,095 --> 00:40:31,722
起立，整装，门口集合
Stand up, buckle up shuffle through the door

478
00:40:31,806 --> 00:40:34,600
起立，整装，门口集合
Stand up, buckle up shuffle through the door

479
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:37,436
跳起来齐高呼我们是海军陆战队
Jump on out and shout Marine Corps

480
00:40:37,603 --> 00:40:40,022
塞杰斯塔向雅典请求帮助原因是什么？
Egesta appealed to Athens on what basis?

481
00:40:40,106 --> 00:40:41,524
基于什么理由？
On what grounds?

482
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:44,819
魏德曼先生？
Mr. Viederman?

483
00:40:45,361 --> 00:40:46,821
方便回答吗？
Bad time for you?

484
00:40:49,142 --> 00:40:51,780
他们说会非常感激@
They said they'd be grateful,

485
00:40:52,785 --> 00:40:53,828
是吗？
didn't they?

486
00:40:53,953 --> 00:40:55,162
对
Yeah.

487
00:40:58,165 --> 00:40:59,125
“替我们打仗”
Fight our battle,

488
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:01,794
“世界各国会敬畏你”
and the rest of the world will fear and respect you.

489
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:04,421
但各国不是早已敬畏雅典？
Yeah, but didn't the rest of the world fear and respect Athens already?

490
00:41:04,505 --> 00:41:05,464
这不重要
It didn't matter.

491
00:41:05,548 --> 00:41:06,757
这不重要？为什么？
It didn't matter? Why not?

492
00:41:06,841 --> 00:41:08,092
骄傲？
Pride, sir?

493
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:10,886
因为那场战役是他们真正输掉的一场战争
That's the battle they lost, the real battle.

494
00:41:11,178 --> 00:41:12,555
全体立正
Attention on deck!

495
00:41:13,514 --> 00:41:15,182
全体注意
Attention to orders.

496
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:18,519
我要做一项宣布
I have a presentation to make.

497
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,455
由于他的所作所为已超越了
For service above and beyond the call of duty

498
00:41:22,612 --> 00:41:25,144
一名游客，甚至是海军的职责
of a tourist, even a Marine,

499
00:41:25,693 --> 00:41:29,029
我们授予约翰・帕特里克・雷恩教授
we recognize Professor John Patrick Ryan

500
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:31,907
一枚紫心勋章
with the Order of the Purple Target,

501
00:41:32,408 --> 00:41:35,744
希望他下次能够躲过子弹
and hope that he will duck next time,

502
00:41:35,828 --> 00:41:39,540
继续教他的历史，而不要成为历史的一部分
lest he become part of history rather than a teacher of it.

503
00:41:48,257 --> 00:41:49,925
- 他多大了？  - 十岁
- How old is he? - Ten.

504
00:41:50,718 --> 00:41:52,511
厚玻璃窗？
Plate glass window?

505
00:41:57,266 --> 00:41:58,601
开始吧
Here we go.

506
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:01,395
- 大家好  - 早上好，凯西
- Hi, guys. - Good morning, Cathy.

507
00:42:05,232 --> 00:42:08,194
我一点有视网膜手术，可能要取消
I've got a retina at 1:00. We might have to bump it.

508
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,070
这个要花不少时间
This could take some time.

509
00:42:11,197 --> 00:42:12,615
取消吧
Yep, let's bump it.

510
00:42:12,698 --> 00:42:13,824
我们准备好了
We're all set to go.

511
00:42:13,908 --> 00:42:15,576
开始吧
Okay, let's do it.

512
00:42:17,703 --> 00:42:20,372
你就像约翰・韦恩一样挺身而出？
So you just waded on in like John Wayne.

513
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:24,043
为什么那么做？
Why did you do it?

514
00:42:24,126 --> 00:42:25,961
你当时怎么想的？
What were you thinking, man?

515
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:30,257
不知道
I don't know.

516
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:31,759
我什么都没想
I wasn't thinking.

517
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:33,135
就这样？
That's it?

518
00:42:33,636 --> 00:42:35,804
你听起来像是我的学生
You sound like some of my students.

519
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,395
我当时很愤怒
It just pissed me off.

520
00:42:44,313 --> 00:42:45,314
我不能就那样袖手旁观
I couldn't just stand there

521
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:48,943
眼睁睁看他们杀人
and watch them shoot those people right in front of me.

522
00:42:50,277 --> 00:42:53,447
是…愤怒
It was rage.

523
00:42:56,408 --> 00:42:57,785
纯粹的愤怒
Pure rage.

524
00:43:01,497 --> 00:43:02,998
令我很生气
It just made me mad.

525
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:07,127
我希望你永远不会生我的气，老兄
Here's hoping you never get mad at me, man.

526
00:43:23,811 --> 00:43:25,437
好了，现在该我了
Okay, now it's my turn.

527
00:43:26,647 --> 00:43:28,315
她迟到了，肖恩
She's late, Sean.

528
00:43:48,294 --> 00:43:50,879
- 然后呢？  - 然后她就去了舞会
- Yeah, and then what? - And then she was at our dance.

529
00:43:50,963 --> 00:43:51,964
是吗？
Yeah?

530
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:54,425
然后最后这个人…
And then this guy, at the end, he...

531
00:43:57,136 --> 00:43:59,972
她很可爱，不是吗？
Kind of cute, isn't she?

532
00:44:01,181 --> 00:44:02,349
是吗？
Is she?

533
00:44:12,026 --> 00:44:13,736
- 再见  - 再见
- Bye. - See ya.

534
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,717
妈妈@
Hi, Mommy.

535
00:44:16,819 --> 00:44:18,601
宝贝，你好吗？
Hi, sweetie. How are you?

536
00:44:19,992 --> 00:44:21,368
行动吧
Let's do it.

537
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:24,746
（停止）

538
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:26,749
见鬼
Goddamn!

539
00:44:37,676 --> 00:44:39,177
（慢行）

540
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:45,601
50号公路，往西
Highway 50. West.

541
00:44:54,943 --> 00:44:57,196
- 晚安，博士  - 晚安
- Good night, Doc. - Good night.

542
00:45:54,586 --> 00:45:56,588

（安纳波利斯）

544
00:46:35,294 --> 00:46:37,212
雷恩博士！让开！
Dr. Ryan! Clear the way!

545
00:46:45,804 --> 00:46:47,306
肖恩・米勒在哪儿？
Where's Sean Miller?

546
00:46:47,514 --> 00:46:49,308
肖恩・米勒在哪儿？
Where's Sean Miller?

547
00:46:49,975 --> 00:46:52,519
雷恩博士，请到这边来

这里是外科
This is Surgery.

549
00:47:06,825 --> 00:47:08,869
请找凯萨琳・雷恩医生
Yeah, Dr. Catherine Ryan, please.

550
00:47:08,994 --> 00:47:11,288
- 雷恩博士，你没事吧？  - 她已经下班了
- Dr. Ryan, are you all right? - She's left for the day.

551
00:47:11,371 --> 00:47:12,498
离开多久了？
How long?

552
00:47:12,915 --> 00:47:14,208
雷恩博士？
Dr. Ryan?

553
00:47:15,876 --> 00:47:18,545
拜托！拜托
Come on! Come on!

555
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:45,405
我是雷恩医生
Yes. This is Dr. Ryan.

556
00:47:45,906 --> 00:47:49,201
我想了解一下汤普森的视网膜报告
I'd like the results on the Thompson boy's retinal scan.

557
00:47:49,535 --> 00:47:50,953
请稍等
Hold, please.

558
00:47:53,622 --> 00:47:55,290
拜托，凯西，挂掉电话
Come on, Cathy, get off the phone.

559
00:48:05,926 --> 00:48:08,679
- 妈你看  - 很漂亮
- Look, Mom. - It's beautiful.

560
00:48:08,762 --> 00:48:10,389
你还在吗？
Are you still holding?

561
00:48:10,556 --> 00:48:12,432
我还在这等着
Yes, I'm still holding.

562
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:15,102
我想和萨顿医生谈谈

你太太没事
Your wife's okay.

600
00:52:15,842 --> 00:52:18,053
只是受了脑震荡，我们做了…
She sustained a concussion, but we ran a complete skull...

601
00:52:18,136 --> 00:52:19,429
- 她怀孕了  - 我知道

我们坐下来慢慢谈
Let's sit down for a moment.

605

No. Talk to me.

606

我们还要等会才知道结果
It's going to be a little while before we know.

607

612

还要七、八个小时才知道结果
We'll know in seven or eight hours.

613
00:53:08,103 --> 00:53:10,063
他们必须把她的脾脏切除
They had to remove her spleen.

614
00:53:11,606 --> 00:53:13,358
她伤得比较厉害
She's in pretty bad shape.

615

我想等到适合的时机
Look, I want to share with Dr. Ryan, personally,

631

再亲自向雷恩博士

表达我们的慰问

爱尔兰共和军的资金是否和…
Can you confirm or deny that funding for the IRA is...

634
00:54:51,331 --> 00:54:54,501
爱尔兰共和军不需对此事负责
The IRA are not responsible for this attack.

635
00:54:54,626 --> 00:54:55,585
你是在说
What you're saying is

636
00:54:55,669 --> 00:54:57,921
爱尔兰共和军和此事毫无关联？
the IRA had nothing to do with this incident?

637
00:54:58,004 --> 00:54:59,339
问题到此为止
No more questions.

那会影响你所作的分析
And that does not make for the best analysis

01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:27,108
若我们能找到奥唐纳@
I think if we could find O'Donnell,

705
01:00:27,183 --> 01:00:29,960
就有机会找到米勒
we'll find Miller still standing at his side.

706
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:32,588
你有在听吗？杰克？
Are you with me? Jack?

707
01:00:32,672 --> 01:00:34,090
有，我在思考
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just thinking.

708
01:00:34,173 --> 01:00:36,259
- 那枪呢？  - 枪怎么了？
- What about the gun? - What about it?

709
01:00:36,342 --> 01:00:37,719
你认为枪有注册？
Think it's going to turn up registered?

710
01:00:37,802 --> 01:00:39,095
我只是问一下
I'm asking a question.

711
01:00:39,178 --> 01:00:40,805
- 混蛋  - 什么事
- Son of a bitch. - What?

712
01:00:44,892 --> 01:00:46,227
你们看
Look, um...

713
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,481
英国反恐部队得到匿名线报
SO13 gets an anonymous tip

714
01:00:50,565 --> 01:00:53,985
指有人在公寓里制造炸弹
about some bomb-like stuff on a table in an apartment.

715
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,903
他们闯进去抓到人后
They go in, and they get some IRA bad guys,

716
01:00:55,987 --> 01:00:57,238
查看四周，发现并不是
they look around, and they see there's no way

717
01:00:57,322 --> 01:00:58,489
从窗户可以看到屋里
anybody could have seen through the window,

718
01:00:58,573 --> 01:01:00,199
如密报者所说那样
like the tipster said.

719
01:01:03,036 --> 01:01:06,706
三名爱尔兰共和军在一家农舍被枪杀
We've got three IRA hit men at a farmhouse hit by somebody else.

720
01:01:06,831 --> 01:01:09,125
那是英国军人下的手
That's British soldiers getting out of hand, Jack.

721
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:11,711
他们肯定跟王室遭袭事件有关
They're not above it, not after a hit on the royal family.

722
01:01:11,836 --> 01:01:13,338
不，你看
No, no, no, no, look.

723
01:01:13,588 --> 01:01:17,133
爱尔兰共和军旅指挥官，吉米・欧莱奥登
We've got Brigade Commander of the IRA, Jimmy O'Reardon,

724
01:01:17,216 --> 01:01:20,011
在廉价旅馆头部中两枪而死亡
checks into a cheap hotel room, ends up dead, double tap to the head.

725
01:01:20,094 --> 01:01:21,512
非常专业
Very professional.

726
01:01:21,929 --> 01:01:24,432
那是农舍事件多久后？
And that was... How long after the farmhouse?

727
01:01:24,515 --> 01:01:25,600
同一天
Same day.

728
01:01:26,392 --> 01:01:27,518
同一天
Same day.

729
01:01:27,894 --> 01:01:30,063
你想到什么？
What are you coming to, Jack?

730
01:01:34,275 --> 01:01:35,360
杰克
Jack!

731
01:01:36,235 --> 01:01:37,445
你要去哪？
Where are you going?

732
01:01:37,528 --> 01:01:40,698
我只是要去洗个脸
I'm just going to go throw some water on my face.

733
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:06,432
杰克
Jack!

734
01:02:40,591 --> 01:02:41,759
不好意思
Excuse me.

735
01:02:43,678 --> 01:02:46,139
我想我们其中一个走错了地方
I think one of us is in the wrong room.

736
01:02:46,264 --> 01:02:48,266
- 对不起  - 没事
- I'm sorry. - That's okay.

737
01:03:17,795 --> 01:03:18,838
杰克！
Jack!

738
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:21,841
卧倒！
Get down!

739
01:03:21,966 --> 01:03:25,136
爱尔兰共和军会承认他们采取的每一次行动
When the IRA carry out any form of campaign, they admit to it.

740
01:03:25,219 --> 01:03:26,262
卧倒
Get down!

741
01:03:26,345 --> 01:03:28,639
在常识上、逻辑上
I mean, common sense, logic...

742
01:03:29,849 --> 01:03:31,642
趴下
Get down! Get down!

743
01:03:39,025 --> 01:03:40,443
没有指纹…
We didn't get any prints or anything like that.

744
01:03:40,526 --> 01:03:42,904
我们到底在找谁？
Listen, who are we looking for here, huh?

745
01:03:43,362 --> 01:03:44,864
是爱尔兰共和军恐怖分子
IRA terrorists,

746
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:47,886
还是那些行事残暴的支派
or some ultraviolent faction of the IRA...

747
01:03:48,019 --> 01:03:49,633
擅自行动呢？
fighting the cause their way?

748
01:03:50,536 --> 01:03:52,163
对，对，对
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

749
01:03:52,546 --> 01:03:55,806
吉米・欧莱奥登和一个红发女郎进入旅馆@
Jimmy O'Reardon checked into a hotel with a woman with long hair,

750
01:03:56,667 --> 01:03:58,878
红色长发
long red hair.

751
01:03:59,504 --> 01:04:01,756
这是我们要找的人
This is who we should be looking for.

752
01:04:01,881 --> 01:04:05,510
只要找到她，就能找到他
We find her, we'll find him.

753
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:30,909
（北非）

754
01:05:00,648 --> 01:05:02,775
我看着他的妻女死亡
I saw his wife and daughter die.

755
01:05:03,651 --> 01:05:05,444
但她和奈迪搞砸了
But she and Neddie blew it.

756
01:05:06,487 --> 01:05:08,072
雷恩还活着
Ryan's still alive.

757
01:05:10,449 --> 01:05:12,118
她们没有死，肖恩！
They're not dead, Sean!

758
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:13,786
什么？
What?

759
01:05:14,453 --> 01:05:15,663
她们活下来了
They survived it.

760
01:05:15,746 --> 01:05:17,999
我直截了当的说
I can't say it any plainer than that!

761
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,919
没关系，反正行动达到了目的
It doesn't matter. The trip served its purpose.

762
01:05:22,003 --> 01:05:23,588
有关系
It does matter!

763
01:05:35,766 --> 01:05:37,727
肖恩，一个小女孩在后院跌一跤
Sean, Americans hold their breath

764
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:40,771
美国人便会开始大惊小怪
every time a little girl falls down a pipe in the backyard,

765
01:05:40,855 --> 01:05:42,773
但你却用机关枪
but you've shot at one with a submachine gun

766
01:05:42,857 --> 01:05:44,692
在她放学路上向她扫射
on her way back from school.

767
01:05:44,817 --> 01:05:46,485
血战开始了
Well, we've started the bleeding war.

768
01:05:46,611 --> 01:05:49,322
英国佬翻遍了贝尔法斯特搜索爱尔兰共和军
The Brits are tearing apart Belfast for the IRA,

769
01:05:49,864 --> 01:05:52,950
他们在美国的支持者却否认袭击
and their American money are denying the hits so loud,

770
01:05:53,117 --> 01:05:55,286
这只能让他们越描越黑
it only makes them look more guilty.

771
01:05:55,786 --> 01:05:57,330
战争很激烈
The war is raging,

772
01:05:57,496 --> 01:06:00,666
等结束后，将只有我们安然无恙
and when it's over, we'll be the only ones left standing.

773
01:06:01,626 --> 01:06:04,295
我让你去为你弟弟报仇
Sean, I let you go for Paddy-boy,

774
01:06:04,712 --> 01:06:06,213
但一切到此为止
but that's it.

775
01:06:08,299 --> 01:06:09,842
我们有正事要办
We've got work to do,

776
01:06:10,301 --> 01:06:12,303
目标不是在马里兰
and it's not in Maryland.

777
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:46,837
嗨
Hello.

778
01:07:07,024 --> 01:07:09,359
（肖恩・米勒）
（逃亡）

779
01:07:19,203 --> 01:07:20,204
喂？
Yeah?

780
01:07:20,705 --> 01:07:22,581
你的家人好吗，雷恩？
How's the family, Ryan?

781
01:07:23,624 --> 01:07:25,751
差点就失去她们了吧
You nearly lost them, didn't you?

782
01:07:26,919 --> 01:07:28,713
要伤害她们太容易了
It's easy to get at them.

783
01:07:30,089 --> 01:07:32,925
你应该好好地照顾她们
You should look after your family better, you know.

784
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:36,929
你还在吗？
Are you there?

785
01:07:37,221 --> 01:07:38,222
在
Yeah.

786
01:07:38,305 --> 01:07:41,225
听说你的女儿好些了是吗？
I understand your little girl's feeling better, eh?

787
01:07:41,475 --> 01:07:43,310
不过割掉了脾脏
Lost her spleen, though, yeah?

788
01:07:43,394 --> 01:07:44,562
真是太可惜了
Pity, that.

789
01:07:45,271 --> 01:07:48,691
以后会很容易受感染吧？
Make it mighty tough on her to fight off infection, eh, Jackie?

790
01:07:48,774 --> 01:07:50,526
你这个混蛋
You sick son of a bitch.

791
01:07:56,282 --> 01:07:57,908
是他，对吗？
It was him, wasn't it?

792
01:08:00,619 --> 01:08:02,788
他永远不会放过我们的
He's never going to leave us alone.

793
01:08:06,417 --> 01:08:08,878
他再没有机会接近我们了
He'll never get that close to us again, honey.

794
01:08:08,961 --> 01:08:11,130
所以他才在半夜打电话
That's why he's making calls in the middle of the night.

795
01:08:11,255 --> 01:08:12,757
因为他无计可施
That's all he can do.

796
01:08:15,426 --> 01:08:16,802
抓住他，杰克
You get him, Jack.

797
01:08:17,261 --> 01:08:19,263
我不在乎你用什么手段
I don't care what you have to do.

798
01:08:19,346 --> 01:08:20,806
一定要抓住他
Just get him.

799
01:08:30,941 --> 01:08:32,485
为你们干一杯
Here's to you

800
01:08:32,610 --> 01:08:34,779
我勇敢的爱尔兰小伙子们
My brave Irish laddies

801
01:08:34,862 --> 01:08:38,574
我们没有被打败，没有消沉悲伤
We'll not be broken downhearted and sad

802
01:08:38,657 --> 01:08:42,787
让我们举起酒杯向所有的同志们敬一杯酒
So let us drink a toast to all of our comrades

803
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:46,665
他们是祖国的荣耀和骄傲
Who stand for the honor and pride of our land

804
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,545
我能请你喝一杯吗？
Can I buy you a drink?

805
01:08:54,465 --> 01:08:55,508
不行
No.

806
01:08:57,551 --> 01:08:59,011
我请你吧
Let me buy you one.

807
01:09:04,141 --> 01:09:05,893
巴尼，两杯威士忌
Barney, two whiskeys.

808
01:09:15,152 --> 01:09:18,489
爱尔兰共和军与这一切无关，我清楚
The IRA's not responsible for all this. I know that.

809
01:09:18,697 --> 01:09:21,158
你在等我点头同意吗？
Are you waiting for me to agree with you?

810
01:09:21,242 --> 01:09:24,036
我一直都是这样对媒体说的
I've been saying this to the press till I'm blue in the face.

811
01:09:24,161 --> 01:09:25,621
这才是关键，对吗？
That's the point, isn't it?

812
01:09:25,704 --> 01:09:29,124
你们说会负责任，等到出了事却又否认
You claim responsibility for one thing, deny it for another.

813
01:09:29,208 --> 01:09:31,043
再没人会相信你
Nobody believes you anymore.

814
01:09:33,504 --> 01:09:36,674
我想知道肖恩和凯文人在哪？
I want to know where Sean Miller and Kevin O'Donnell are.

815
01:09:39,844 --> 01:09:41,846
让我搞清楚你说的话
Let me try and understand this.

816
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:46,225
你要我出卖我的爱尔兰同胞
You want me to sell out my fellow Irishmen to you?

817
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,602
这是你来这的目的？
Is that why you came down here?

818
01:09:48,769 --> 01:09:50,604
你一点也不了解我
You don't understand me at all.

819
01:09:50,688 --> 01:09:52,064
我想我明白
Oh, I think I do.

820
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:53,216
听好
Look,

821
01:09:53,649 --> 01:09:56,110
我不在乎他们的所作所为
I don't give a damn what they've done,

822
01:09:56,944 --> 01:09:59,154
但要我出卖我的同胞
but the day that I sell out my countrymen

823
01:09:59,238 --> 01:10:02,408
我不如一枪把自己打死
will be the day that I put a bullet through my own head.

824
01:10:04,702 --> 01:10:06,078
这就是你的结论？
That's it, then, huh?

825
01:10:06,203 --> 01:10:07,246
没错
That's it.

826
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:10,749
我刚想了一下，我不想和你喝酒了
You know, on second thought, maybe I won't have a drink with you.

827
01:10:10,875 --> 01:10:12,293
那我只好回家了
Okay, then I'll go home.

828
01:10:12,376 --> 01:10:13,794
一路顺风
Have a safe trip.

829
01:10:13,878 --> 01:10:16,922
我会答应让电视台到家里采访
I'll go home and call the TV stations, give them what they want.

830
01:10:17,047 --> 01:10:19,925
允许他们到我女儿的病房拍摄
Let them take their cameras into my daughter's hospital room.

831
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:21,802
这将在晚间新闻播出
Put it on the evening news.

832
01:10:23,053 --> 01:10:25,347
我不在乎是不是你干的
I don't give a shit whether you did it or not,

833
01:10:25,431 --> 01:10:27,433
其他人也不会在乎
and neither will anyone else,

834
01:10:27,558 --> 01:10:29,685
可你休想再得到任何金援
but I will put such a stranglehold on your gun money,

835
01:10:29,768 --> 01:10:32,271
你们就等着在大街上扔石头玩吧
you'll be out in the street throwing rocks.

836
01:10:32,646 --> 01:10:34,899
我会摧毁你们
I will fucking destroy you.

837
01:10:35,399 --> 01:10:37,568
将此作为我的毕生追求目标
I will make it my mission in life.

838
01:10:43,741 --> 01:10:44,783
对不起
Excuse me.

839
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:49,914
你们刚听到了吗？
Well, lads, did you hear that?

840
01:11:05,429 --> 01:11:08,140
往这边站一些，瞄准一点
Stand sideways, you're less of a target.

841
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:14,313
很棒
Yes!

842
01:11:16,523 --> 01:11:17,983
卫星来了！
Satellite's coming!

843
01:11:19,026 --> 01:11:20,653
弟兄们，我们走
Celts, let's go!

844
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:23,822
快走
Come on.

845
01:11:28,494 --> 01:11:29,828
快进去
Get inside!

846
01:11:37,878 --> 01:11:38,963
好
So...

847
01:11:40,798 --> 01:11:44,093
英国反恐部队追查到公爵被袭时所用的武器
SO13 traced the weapons used in the Lord Holmes incident

848
01:11:44,176 --> 01:11:46,637
是来自卡扎菲的军火供应商
to an arms dealer that supplies Qaddafi.

849
01:11:47,513 --> 01:11:49,014
肖恩逃跑过程中
Now, when Sean Miller escaped,

850
01:11:49,139 --> 01:11:52,267
最后一次被人看见是在英吉利海峡的一艘船上
he was last seen in a Zodiac heading out into the Channel in a gale,

851
01:11:52,351 --> 01:11:53,602
开始我觉得不可能
which didn't make much sense

852
01:11:53,686 --> 01:11:57,147
但我查了下那天的货船
until I checked on the freighters that were out there that day.

853
01:11:57,231 --> 01:11:58,315
有一艘叙利亚籍的船
Syrian registry.

854
01:11:58,399 --> 01:11:59,942
负责将中东的军火
Known to carry arms from the Middle East

855
01:12:00,025 --> 01:12:03,237
运送到地中海的客户，卡扎菲是其中之一
to client states in the Mediterranean, including Qaddafi.

856
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:06,198
米勒坐船去了北非？
So, Miller takes a slow boat to North Africa.

857
01:12:06,323 --> 01:12:07,408
没错
Exactly.

858
01:12:08,701 --> 01:12:10,536
我们的卫星在沙漠上空
Now, we send our birds up over the desert,

859
01:12:10,661 --> 01:12:12,287
拍摄到了多少个营地？
photographing, what, how many camps?

860
01:12:12,371 --> 01:12:13,414
182个
One hundred and eighty-two.

861
01:12:13,497 --> 01:12:15,958
一天之内就拍到了182个
One hundred and eighty-two camps a day in North Africa.

862
01:12:16,041 --> 01:12:18,752
利比亚基地，巴解组织，红色旅
Libyan bases, PLO, Red Brigade,

863
01:12:19,044 --> 01:12:22,172
法国直接行动组织，西德红军派
Action-Directe, West German Red Army Faction.

864
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:26,093
但是这条船停靠在班加西那天
But on the day that this particular ship docked in Benghazi,

865
01:12:26,176 --> 01:12:29,805
只有九个营地有新人加入的活动迹象
there's activity in only nine camps with people arriving.

866
01:12:29,888 --> 01:12:32,057
这个确定是“巴解组织”
Now, this one we know for sure is PLO.

867
01:12:32,182 --> 01:12:33,267
这个是“光明之路”
This one's Shining Path.

868
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:35,102
这七个我们不知道
These seven we're not so sure about.

869
01:12:35,185 --> 01:12:36,228
为什么？
Why?

870
01:12:37,062 --> 01:12:38,313
这是我们的卫星…
Well, we got satellites...

871
01:12:38,397 --> 01:12:40,149
因为这些帐篷里的人
Well, because the people in those camps

872
01:12:40,232 --> 01:12:41,942
比我们更清楚卫星
know probably better than we do

873
01:12:42,026 --> 01:12:45,571
何时会从他们头顶经过
exactly what time the satellite's going to pass overhead.

874
01:12:47,114 --> 01:12:48,365
马蒂
And, Marty,

875
01:12:49,450 --> 01:12:52,161
你得让我们重设卫星时间表
unless you authorize us to retask those satellites

876
01:12:52,244 --> 01:12:55,539
在他们查觉前就开始拍照
so we can get a look before they're overhead from the side,

877
01:12:55,748 --> 01:12:58,584
这样才能知道他们在哪个营地
we're never going to know which camp they're at.

878
01:12:59,877 --> 01:13:02,629
杰克，你知道重设卫星时刻表
Jack, do you have any idea how big a deal it is

879
01:13:02,713 --> 01:13:04,631
是多么复杂的工程吗？
to retask those satellites?

880
01:13:05,716 --> 01:13:06,800
知道
Yeah.

881
01:13:20,564 --> 01:13:22,441
再看看18号营地
Bring up camp 18 again.

882
01:13:29,239 --> 01:13:30,949
锁定这个营地
Tighten on the camp here.

883

看看这里
Let's look up in here.

884
01:13:38,791 --> 01:13:40,584
看能不能发现什么
See what we can see.

885
01:13:50,302 --> 01:13:52,429
给我看看这帮人
Show me this grouping here.

886
01:14:06,985 --> 01:14:09,822
没什么特别，返回原来的画面
No, that's nothing. Go back to the bigger picture.

887
01:14:11,532 --> 01:14:13,117
看看这下面
Let me see down here.

What's that?

889
01:14:20,499 --> 01:14:22,459
锁定那个
Tighten up on that, will you?

890
01:14:33,137 --> 01:14:35,681

14号
The 14th.

982
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:05,542
杰弗里
Geoffrey,

983
01:23:05,886 --> 01:23:09,668
向约翰・雷恩确认一下授勋晚宴的事宜
let's check with John Ryan about scheduling a presentation dinner

984
01:23:09,746 --> 01:23:12,686
在华盛顿使馆的时间是…
at our embassy in Washington on the...

985
01:23:13,198 --> 01:23:14,324
14号
14th.

986
01:23:15,408 --> 01:23:16,701
14号
The 14th.

987
01:23:18,536 --> 01:23:21,748
我们再核对一下，好让我有个清楚的概念
So, let's go over this again so I can get it clear.

988
01:23:21,831 --> 01:23:24,000
我们先在华盛顿白宫…
We start in Washington with the White House...

989
01:23:28,171 --> 01:23:29,255
我是杰弗里・沃特金斯
Geoffrey Watkins.

990
01:23:29,339 --> 01:23:32,717
抱歉，我要找泰特斯先生
Oh, I beg your pardon. I'm trying to reach Mr. Titus.

991
01:23:33,551 --> 01:23:35,595
请问这分机是2691吗？
Is that extension 2691?

992
01:23:35,887 --> 01:23:37,347
不是，是2619
No, this is 2619.

993
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:39,182
非常抱歉
I'm terribly sorry.

994
01:23:49,234 --> 01:23:50,944
你起来做什么？快回去睡觉
What are you doing up? Go back to bed.

995
01:23:51,027 --> 01:23:53,655
我想在她醒来时在她身旁
I wanted to be there when she wakes up.

996
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:56,991
我和你一起去，然后我坐计程车回来
I'll go with you, and then I'll take a cab back.

997
01:23:57,075 --> 01:23:58,201
好吧
Okay.

998
01:24:00,203 --> 01:24:01,287
喂？（请找约翰・雷恩爵士）
Hello?

999
01:24:02,414 --> 01:24:03,915
请稍等
Yes. Just a minute.

1000
01:24:04,082 --> 01:24:05,583
找你的
It's for you,

约翰爵士
Sir John.

1002
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:09,587
你好？
Hello?

1003
01:24:12,716 --> 01:24:13,842
对不起，先生
Excuse me, sir.

1004
01:24:13,925 --> 01:24:17,011
雷恩先生当晚有庆祝活动，不能改期了
Mr. Ryan has a special celebration that evening that he can't change.

1005
01:24:17,095 --> 01:24:18,972
他想邀请你参加
He wondered if you might care to join them.

1006
01:24:19,055 --> 01:24:20,807
在哪，他家里吗？
Where, at his house?

1007
01:24:21,307 --> 01:24:22,600
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

1008
01:24:25,895 --> 01:24:27,105
有何不可？
Why not?

1009
01:24:38,575 --> 01:24:40,869
这是我们八天前在柏林拍的
We shot this eight days ago in Berlin.

1010
01:24:42,746 --> 01:24:43,913

三，共四位英国人和他一起

1013
01:24:49,627 --> 01:24:50,920
轻型武器
Light arms.

1014
01:24:52,797 --> 01:24:54,549
重型武器在车内
The heavy stuff's in the cars.

1015
01:24:54,630 --> 01:24:55,851
他是德国人
He's German,

1016
01:24:56,386 --> 01:24:57,300
他也是
he's German.

1017
01:24:57,427 --> 01:24:59,179
肖恩，你对这不感兴趣吗？
This boring you, Sean?

1018
01:24:59,637 --> 01:25:01,431
四个，加起来总共六个
Four, six altogether.

1019
01:25:02,599 --> 01:25:05,852
霍姆斯飞去华盛顿，也应该是同样的保安人员
Should be the same security when Holmes flies to Washington.

1020
01:25:05,977 --> 01:25:08,813
我们必须找到他周围没有保安人员的空隙
We've got to find the moment when he's unprotected.

1021
01:25:09,147 --> 01:25:13,109
华盛顿四天，纽约一天
Four days in Washington, one day in New York.

1022
01:25:14,319 --> 01:25:15,612
购物
Shopping.

1023
01:25:29,834 --> 01:25:32,796
没错 两个高加索人
Yeah. Two Caucasians.

1024
01:25:33,671 --> 01:25:35,840
看看那个戴帽子的人
Take a look at the one with the hat.

1025
01:25:38,301 --> 01:25:40,136
他胳膊有点发红
His arms look a little pink.

1026
01:25:40,970 --> 01:25:43,181
太阳晒伤的，一定是刚来的
Sunburn. New arrival.

1027
01:25:59,823 --> 01:26:01,658
你觉得呢？同一个人？
What do you think? Same guy?

1028
01:26:04,911 --> 01:26:07,205
那个珍本书商，丹尼斯库利
That rare book dealer, Dennis Cooley,

1029
01:26:08,039 --> 01:26:09,374
他是秃头
he's bald.

1030
01:26:12,210 --> 01:26:15,348
营地里可能有女人@
Now, it's possible there could be a woman in some of these camps,

1031
01:26:17,006 --> 01:26:19,843
但是她和库利一起出现…
but with her and Cooley in the same place,

1032
01:26:22,053 --> 01:26:23,721
如果那是库利
if that is Cooley,

1033
01:26:23,930 --> 01:26:26,391
就应该不只是巧合
the odds of coincidence are dropping fast.

1034
01:26:29,227 --> 01:26:32,272
但我还不确定，我还没有办法…
Still, I don't know. There's no way I can be...

1035
01:26:34,774 --> 01:26:36,568
绝对肯定
absolutely certain.

1036
01:26:37,193 --> 01:26:38,528
拜托你，杰克
Excuse me, Jack.

1037
01:26:39,279 --> 01:26:42,866
生命中有能完全肯定的事吗？
Tell me one thing in life that is absolutely for certain.

1038
01:26:45,368 --> 01:26:46,870
我女儿的爱
My daughter's love.

1039
01:26:49,747 --> 01:26:52,292
我要知道的是你的最佳臆测
What I need to hear from you is your best guess,

1040
01:26:52,375 --> 01:26:54,085
我想我知道了
and I think I've heard it.

1041
01:26:59,215 --> 01:27:00,550
没错吧？
Haven't I?

1042
01:27:11,144 --> 01:27:13,646
那些混蛋夺走了我的书店
The bastards took away my book shop.

1043
01:27:14,063 --> 01:27:15,690
他们搬走了我的书！
They took away my books!

1044
01:27:15,773 --> 01:27:17,859
丹尼斯，你不能来这里
I'm sorry, Dennis. You can't come.

1045
01:27:17,942 --> 01:27:19,903
你没有经过训练
You haven't got the training,

1046
01:27:20,403 --> 01:27:22,363
这项任务很复杂的
and this mission's going to be very messy.

1047
01:27:22,447 --> 01:27:24,073
我会开枪
I can fire a gun.

1048
01:27:48,473 --> 01:27:49,974
抱歉，丹尼斯
Sorry, Dennis.

1049
01:28:21,798 --> 01:28:23,091
你要带我去哪，马蒂？
Where are you taking me, Marty?

1050
01:28:23,174 --> 01:28:25,510
是你带我们来的，杰克
It's you who've taken us, Jack...

1051
01:28:26,636 --> 01:28:28,721
卫星现在已进入目的地区域
Satellite now entering target area.

1052
01:28:28,805 --> 01:28:30,306
进入战斗
into battle.

1053
01:28:30,890 --> 01:28:31,975
长官
Sir.

1054

收到，行动

收到
Roger that.

1079
01:32:31,964 --> 01:32:34,050
你的手下需要喝杯咖啡吗？
You sure your men outside wouldn't like some coffee?

1080
01:32:34,133 --> 01:32:35,593
不用了，雷恩夫人
No, thank you, Mrs. Ryan. They'll be just fine.

1081
01:32:35,718 --> 01:32:36,761

我想谢谢你，雷恩小姐
And I'd to thank you, Miss Ryan,

1083
01:32:38,554 --> 01:32:40,932
谢谢你邀请我们参加庆祝会

你是一位美丽优雅的女孩

不客气

01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:53,106
我想晚宴后再颁发勋章，如果你没有意见的话

1088
01:32:53,444 --> 01:32:54,737

- Oh, my. That's very nice. - It's lovely.

1092
01:33:05,414 --> 01:33:07,750
我不是已经给过你一个了吗？
Didn't I already give you one of those?

1093
01:33:12,171 --> 01:33:13,798
请大家自便
Help yourselves.

1094
01:33:22,932 --> 01:33:25,851
这是你的第二块蛋糕了吧，小宝贝？
Is that your second piece of cake, my little sweetie?

1095
01:33:27,353 --> 01:33:28,771
杰克，厕所在哪？
Where's the bathroom, Jack?

1096
01:33:28,854 --> 01:33:31,107
- 二楼左手边  - 谢谢
- Second door on the left. - Thank you.

1097
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:32,566
谁还要点咖啡？
More coffee, anyone?

1098
01:33:32,650 --> 01:33:33,943
我要
I'd love some.

1099
01:33:35,444 --> 01:33:36,612
失陪一下
Excuse me.

1100
01:33:37,530 --> 01:33:38,823
打雷了
Here it comes.

1101
01:33:39,782 --> 01:33:40,866
厕所？
Bathroom?

1102
01:33:42,785 --> 01:33:44,120
- 里面有人  - 不，不是那间
- Someone in there. - No, that's not it.

1103
01:33:44,203 --> 01:33:45,997
那是地下室
That's the basement.

1104
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:55,965
喂？
Hello?

1105
01:33:56,048 --> 01:33:57,174
杰克？我是马蒂
Jack? Marty.

1106
01:33:57,300 --> 01:33:59,135
马蒂，有什么事吗？
Marty. What's going on?

1107
01:33:59,302 --> 01:34:00,594
很抱歉打扰了你的派对
I'm sorry to interrupt your party,

1108
01:34:00,678 --> 01:34:02,346
但你应该想尽快知道这消息
but I thought you'd like to know right away.

1109
01:34:02,972 --> 01:34:05,641
空降特勤队已经确认了丹尼斯・库利的尸体
SAS just made positive ID on Dennis Cooley.

1110
01:34:05,891 --> 01:34:07,476
其他人呢？
What about the others?

1111
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:09,478
尸体面目全非
Well, it was pretty messy, as it turns out.

1112
01:34:09,645 --> 01:34:12,815
需要48小时才能做出牙齿鉴定
It's going to take 48 hours to verify the dental records,

1113
01:34:13,357 --> 01:34:15,401
他们正在努力辨认
but they're keeping right on it.

1114
01:34:16,527 --> 01:34:17,653
糟糕
Oh, great.

1115
01:34:17,820 --> 01:34:18,904
怎么了？
What?

1116
01:34:19,322 --> 01:34:21,449
现在正打雷，屋里停电了
The storm just knocked out the power here to the house.

1117

我要去点一些蜡烛

1118
01:34:22,658 --> 01:34:24,493
我也为你点一支

1119
01:34:24,827 --> 01:34:26,329
好，马蒂，谢谢

1121
01:34:29,999 --> 01:34:31,834
怎么，你忘了交电费吗，凯西？
What, forget to pay your bill, Cath?

1122
01:34:31,917 --> 01:34:34,003
罗伯，你很幽默
Robert. Very funny.

1123
01:34:34,503 --> 01:34:35,546
大家都没事吧？
Everyone all right?

1124
01:34:35,671 --> 01:34:38,049
- 我们很好，杰克  - 这样感觉更棒
- We're fine, Jack. - We like it better this way.

1125
01:34:38,424 --> 01:34:40,301
这种情况可不常发生，霍姆斯公爵
This doesn't happen very often, Lord Holmes.

1126
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:42,845
只有皇室人员来参加晚宴才会出现这种情况
Only when we have royalty over for dinner.

1127
01:34:45,014 --> 01:34:46,724
我知道您了解的
I knew you'd understand.

1128
01:34:50,019 --> 01:34:51,354
怎么了？
Something wrong?

1129
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:52,791
跟我来好吗？@
Come with me, will you?

1130
01:34:52,943 --> 01:34:54,390
妈妈，我必须这样吗？
Mom, do I have to?

1131
01:34:56,025 --> 01:34:58,819
如果停电是因为雷电，那么船库也应该停电
If the storm had knocked out the lights, they'd be out in the boathouse, too.

1132
01:34:58,903 --> 01:34:59,862
所以呢？
So?

1133
01:34:59,945 --> 01:35:03,783
电力来自街上，再接来这里
Power comes in from the street, and then branches off to here.

1134
01:35:05,534 --> 01:35:06,577
上帝
Jesus.

1135
01:35:09,372 --> 01:35:11,290
我是雷恩，请问有外交安全局的探员吗？
This is Ryan. Any DSS agent?

1136
01:35:12,375 --> 01:35:14,794
外交安全局的探员请回话，我是雷恩
Any DSS agent, this is Ryan.

1137
01:35:15,044 --> 01:35:17,129
有马里兰州州警吗？有人吗？
Maryland troopers? Anyone?

1138
01:35:18,089 --> 01:35:19,715
有人听到我说话吗？
Is anyone reading me?

1139
01:35:20,424 --> 01:35:21,634
有人吗？
Anybody?

1140
01:35:23,094 --> 01:35:25,679
电来的时候我能再下来吗？
Can I come back down when the lights are on?

1141
01:35:25,763 --> 01:35:27,640
不行，小宝贝，你必须睡觉
No, sweetie-pie. You've got to get some sleep.

1142
01:35:27,723 --> 01:35:29,266
已经很晚了
It's very late.

1143
01:35:29,892 --> 01:35:31,102
可恶
Goddamn.

1144
01:35:36,107 --> 01:35:37,400
不要告诉他们
Don't tell me.

1145
01:35:37,942 --> 01:35:39,443
风暴很大
Quite a storm.

1146
01:35:44,657 --> 01:35:47,034
不要碰我，你在做什么？
Take your hands off me. What the hell do you think you're doing?

1147
01:35:47,118 --> 01:35:48,119
杰克
Jack.

1148
01:35:52,998 --> 01:35:54,166
枪
Gun.

1149
01:35:55,418 --> 01:35:56,502
杰克
Jack.

1150
01:36:08,681 --> 01:36:10,307
不要动
Stay right there.

1151
01:36:10,933 --> 01:36:12,101
该死
Shit.

1152
01:36:12,977 --> 01:36:14,520
罗伯，这边
Rob, over here.

1153
01:36:14,978 --> 01:36:16,647
（开）
（关）

1154
01:36:20,943 --> 01:36:22,945
计划是什么？要来多少人？
What's the plan? How many are coming?

1155
01:36:23,028 --> 01:36:24,196
肖恩・米勒在哪？
Where's Sean Miller?

1156
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:26,282
我不懂你在讲什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

1157
01:36:26,365 --> 01:36:27,700
把枪给我
Give me the gun.

1158
01:36:32,329 --> 01:36:33,914
五或六个？
Five? Six?

1159
01:36:33,998 --> 01:36:35,374
可能更多
I don't know. Maybe more.

1160
01:36:35,740 --> 01:36:38,055
我去找其他人，不要开灯
I'll get the others. Don't turn on the lights.

1161
01:36:45,968 --> 01:36:47,928
拿着这个，快去地下室
Take this. Get down in the basement quick.

1162
01:36:48,012 --> 01:36:49,513
- 凯西和莎莉在哪儿？  - 她们在楼上
- Where's Cathy and Sally? - They're upstairs.

1163
01:36:49,638 --> 01:36:50,806
- 她在哄莎莉睡觉  - 快走
- She's putting Sally to bed. - Go.

1164
01:36:50,890 --> 01:36:52,349
怎么了？
What's wrong?

1165
01:37:20,544 --> 01:37:22,713
来吧，雷恩，现身吧
Come on, Ryan. Show yourself.

1166
01:37:28,219 --> 01:37:29,637
安妮特，楼上
Annette, upstairs.

1167
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:30,888
好
Right.

1168
01:37:47,613 --> 01:37:49,365
跟我来，宝贝，快
Come on, sweetie, come on.

1169
01:37:50,115 --> 01:37:51,825
怎么了，妈妈？
What's wrong, Mommy?

1170
01:37:54,370 --> 01:37:56,539
你帮我爬到凳子上去
Now, you've got to help me. Climb up on the stool.

1171
01:37:56,622 --> 01:37:58,582
上面有一支猎枪
There's a shotgun there.

1172
01:38:11,554 --> 01:38:14,723
杰克，你把子弹放哪里了？
Oh, God, Jack, what did you do with the shells?

1173
01:38:18,894 --> 01:38:20,271
走，走
Go, go, go.

1174
01:39:10,613 --> 01:39:11,864
- 快趴下  - 妈妈
- Get down. - Mommy!

1175
01:39:11,947 --> 01:39:12,990
继续
Go on.

1176
01:39:33,552 --> 01:39:34,637
进去
Get back.

1177
01:39:47,358 --> 01:39:49,193
你们没事吧？莎莉在哪？
You all right? Where's Sally?

1178
01:39:49,318 --> 01:39:50,694
- 爸爸  - 莎莉
- Daddy. - Sally.

1179
01:39:51,236 --> 01:39:52,655
没事了，亲爱的
It's okay, honey.

1180
01:39:55,699 --> 01:39:56,992
跟我来
Come on.

1181
01:40:19,390 --> 01:40:22,726
宝贝，你一定要安静
Honey, you've just got to be real quiet. Real quiet.

1182
01:40:41,578 --> 01:40:42,788
找到你了
Gotcha.

1183
01:41:10,899 --> 01:41:12,109
老天
Christ.

1184
01:41:14,778 --> 01:41:15,988
抱紧了
Hold on.

1185
01:41:20,993 --> 01:41:22,619
来吧
Come on, come on.

1186
01:41:39,803 --> 01:41:42,723
你什么意思？谁联系不上了？
What are you talking about? Who is off the air?

1187
01:41:42,806 --> 01:41:44,933
外交安全局，马里兰州州警，所有人
DSS, state troopers, everyone.

1188
01:41:45,142 --> 01:41:46,769
保安公司…
The security company...

1189
01:41:47,352 --> 01:41:49,980
马上帮我接人质救援小组
Get me Hostage Rescue at Quantico now.

1190
01:41:54,985 --> 01:41:57,154
罗伯！开门
Robby! Open up.

1191
01:41:58,363 --> 01:42:00,115
- 罗伯，是我们  - 杰克？
- Robby, it's us. - Jack?

1192
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:04,888
- 他们在外面  - 肖恩，冷静
- They're outside. - Sean, cool it.

1193
01:42:04,962 --> 01:42:08,120
我们目标是皇室，我们拿着尸体可换不了赎金
It's the royal we want. We can't ransom a dead body.

1194
01:42:10,834 --> 01:42:12,419
到处都是他们的人
They're all over the place, man.

1195
01:42:12,503 --> 01:42:14,004
抱紧我
Stay close to me.

1196
01:42:17,299 --> 01:42:19,426
你们准备怎么逃走？
How were you going to get away, huh?

1197
01:42:19,510 --> 01:42:20,969
要我在膝盖上补一枪吗？
Want to go for the other knee?

1198
01:42:21,053 --> 01:42:23,055
快说
Come on! Come on.

1199
01:42:23,514 --> 01:42:25,682
悬崖底下有船
Boats. Bottom of the cliff.

1200
01:42:25,849 --> 01:42:27,226
那有绳子可以下去
There are ropes.

1201
01:42:28,143 --> 01:42:29,311
凯文
Kevin!

1202
01:43:39,214 --> 01:43:40,757
你杀死他了
You killed him!

1203
01:44:34,478 --> 01:44:36,104
不！肖恩
No, Sean, no!

1204
01:44:36,605 --> 01:44:38,106
我们需要活捉霍姆斯公爵
We need Holmes alive!

1205
01:44:38,273 --> 01:44:39,608
已经不需要了！
We're past that!

1206
01:44:40,025 --> 01:44:41,193
活捉
Alive!

1207
01:44:51,495 --> 01:44:52,788
快走
Come on!

1208
01:45:14,518 --> 01:45:15,686
联系上了吗？
Any contact?

1209
01:45:17,646 --> 01:45:18,730
没有
Still off the air.

1210
01:45:39,876 --> 01:45:41,336
他在那里
There he is!

1211
01:45:51,179 --> 01:45:52,723
蹲下
Stay down there.

1212
01:46:19,249 --> 01:46:21,043
跟我来啊，王八蛋
Come on, you bastards.

1213
01:46:26,590 --> 01:46:28,550
来吧！来吧
Come on! Come on!

1214
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,219
船上只有他一个人
He's alone!

1215
01:46:31,595 --> 01:46:33,930
他把我们从皇室那里引开
He's leading us away from the royal!

1216
01:46:34,056 --> 01:46:35,640
- 调头吧，肖恩  - 不
- Turn around, Sean. - No.

1217
01:46:35,724 --> 01:46:37,184
调头，肖恩！
Turn it round, Sean!

1218
01:46:37,267 --> 01:46:38,477
- 调头，肖恩！  - 不！
- Turn it round, Sean! - No!

1219
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:39,770
肖恩！
Sean!

1220
01:46:41,438 --> 01:46:44,149
调头！调头！
Turn it round! Turn it round!

1221
01:46:44,232 --> 01:46:46,068
不要管雷恩了！
Forget about Ryan!

1222
01:46:46,568 --> 01:46:48,612
不要破坏行动，兄弟
Don't blow the mission now, boy!

1223
01:46:48,779 --> 01:46:50,572
那不是我的行动！
That's not my mission!

1224
01:46:56,912 --> 01:46:58,580
你这个疯子
You crazy bastard!

1225
01:47:44,876 --> 01:47:46,002
糟糕
Damn!

1226
01:51:17,547 --> 01:51:19,382
吃饱了吗？还是再来点别的
Had enough to eat, honey, or do you want something else?

1227
01:51:19,507 --> 01:51:21,384
- 来点吐司还是…  - 薄煎饼
- Some toast or... - Pancakes.

1228
01:51:21,509 --> 01:51:22,802
没时间做薄煎饼了
There's no time for pancakes, honey.

1229
01:51:22,886 --> 01:51:24,179
要面包还是吐司？
Do you want toast or toast?

1230
01:51:25,388 --> 01:51:26,431
吐司
Toast.

1231
01:51:26,556 --> 01:51:29,225
- 接下电话好吗？  - 我来接吧
- Is somebody going to get that? - I'm getting it.

1232
01:51:29,351 --> 01:51:30,393
莎莉？
Sally?

1233
01:51:31,227 --> 01:51:33,104
喂？对
Hello? It is.

1234
01:51:33,563 --> 01:51:34,689
她在，请稍等
Yeah, hold on a second.

1235
01:51:34,773 --> 01:51:37,233
- 你的背包在哪里？  - 是泽里安医生
- Where's your backpack? - It's Dr. Zaillian.

1236
01:51:37,942 --> 01:51:39,402
- 羊水诊断结果  - 对
- The amnio. - Yeah.

1237
01:51:39,611 --> 01:51:40,779
喂？
Hello?

1238
01:51:41,571 --> 01:51:43,198
不会有事吧？
Is it going to be okay?

1239
01:51:44,282 --> 01:51:47,702
没事的，宝贝，我们就等着结果好了
It's going to be fine, honey. We're just waiting to find out.

1240
01:51:51,081 --> 01:51:52,165
太好了
Great.

1241
01:51:52,248 --> 01:51:54,417
你想要什么果酱？
What do you want on your toast, honey?

1242
01:51:54,542 --> 01:51:55,585
- 草莓？  - 草莓
- Strawberry? - Strawberry.

1243
01:51:55,710 --> 01:51:56,711
等等
Hold on a second.

1244
01:51:56,752 --> 01:51:58,254
（名字）
（男孩女孩）

1245
01:51:58,296 --> 01:51:59,672
想知道是男孩还是女孩吗？
Do you want to know what it is?

1246
01:51:59,756 --> 01:52:00,757
他告诉你了吗？
Did he tell you?

1247
01:52:00,882 --> 01:52:02,675
他问我，所以我又问你
He's asking. I'm asking you.

1248
01:52:02,759 --> 01:52:05,637
你想知道吗？
I don't know. Do you want to know?

1249
01:52:06,096 --> 01:52:07,639
我不知道，你呢？
I don't know. Do you?

1250
01:52:08,390 --> 01:52:11,059
我本来想知道，现在又不确定了
I thought I wanted to know, but now I'm not so sure.

1251
01:52:11,142 --> 01:52:13,353
等一下好吗，我们在商量
Hold on a second. We're discussing it.

1252
01:52:13,436 --> 01:52:15,730
我也是，既想知道又不想知道
Me, neither. I mean, I do and I don't.

1253
01:52:18,608 --> 01:52:19,776
他等着呢
He's waiting.

1254
01:52:25,615 --> 01:52:26,825
好吧
Okay.

1255
01:52:27,575 --> 01:52:28,785
告诉我们
Tell us.

1256
01:52:29,744 --> 01:52:31,079
好吧，告诉我们
Okay, tell us.

1257
01:52:36,501 --> 01:52:37,836
谢谢
Thank you.
