3
00:00:32,037 --> 00:00:33,357
Are you asleep?

4
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,397
Teresa?

5
00:00:35,981 --> 00:00:37,261
Are you asleep?

6
00:01:34,037 --> 00:01:37,674
That dog of yours will get rabies.
He's been bitten by a rabid one.

7
00:01:37,717 --> 00:01:39,718
There is an epidemic.
They go rabid.

8
00:01:39,761 --> 00:01:41,456
And piss in gateways.

9
00:01:43,677 --> 00:01:45,525
Today's the first of September.

10
00:01:45,593 --> 00:01:46,593
So what?

11
00:01:49,237 --> 00:01:50,277
I'm in a hurry!

12
00:01:50,338 --> 00:01:52,065
Haven't seen a penny since June.

13
00:01:52,108 --> 00:01:53,981
Some want to pay
6 month in advance.

14
00:01:54,024 --> 00:01:56,053
The wife gets paid.
She'll pay you.

15
00:02:15,637 --> 00:02:17,757
Man, how are you driving!
What's up?

16
00:02:17,917 --> 00:02:19,197
Hush, it's the police!

17
00:02:22,197 --> 00:02:24,997
Silence, citizens!
People are asleep.

18
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,597
He slapped me!

19
00:02:28,226 --> 00:02:30,554
Edzio, that swine slapped
your wife's ass!

20
00:02:30,597 --> 00:02:32,594
Will you let this swine,
get away!

21
00:02:32,637 --> 00:02:34,197
Who do you think we are!?

22
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,600
That's my husband. Every night
I have to drag this bastard...

23
00:02:37,643 --> 00:02:39,781
And on top of that,
that swine slaps me!

24
00:02:40,538 --> 00:02:41,578
Which one is it?

25
00:02:41,717 --> 00:02:45,595
Man's to get up for work and this
rabble is still in a party mood.

26
00:02:45,638 --> 00:02:47,914
- Had enough?
- Tell him to pick it up!

27
00:02:47,957 --> 00:02:50,231
Edzio will show him!
Teach the swine a lesson!

28
00:02:50,274 --> 00:02:51,994
He will get you, you swine!

29
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:54,397
Edzio will get you!
Get him, Edzio!

30
00:02:55,557 --> 00:02:58,397
Had enough? Enough.
Let's go!

31
00:02:58,837 --> 00:03:00,477
Pick it up, you jerk!

32
00:03:29,157 --> 00:03:30,717
IDENTIFICATION MARKS: NONE

33
00:04:07,517 --> 00:04:09,597
- Gentlemen, a new game!
- What is it?

34
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,623
Banknote planes.
The closest to the corner wins!

35
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:13,706
All right, go on!

36
00:04:16,997 --> 00:04:18,877
- Like that!
- Well, throw one!

37
00:04:19,877 --> 00:04:20,957
- Quiet!
- Good!

38
00:04:21,157 --> 00:04:22,237
Not bad!

39
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,117
Gonna play, mate?

40
00:04:25,277 --> 00:04:26,997
- I'll get it all!
- Go on!

41
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,117
I'll get it all, I will!

42
00:04:30,277 --> 00:04:31,797
Will you give me a note?

43
00:04:33,037 --> 00:04:34,855
There's some coppers short.

44
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,971
- Here. Go on, play!
- Guys, don't be like that.

45
00:04:37,996 --> 00:04:39,116
Well! Watch out!

46
00:04:40,757 --> 00:04:42,157
All right, go on!

47
00:04:42,877 --> 00:04:43,957
Next!

48
00:04:49,117 --> 00:04:50,437
Let's twist!

49
00:05:14,277 --> 00:05:15,277
Quiet!

50
00:05:15,517 --> 00:05:17,437
<i>Eurydice, don't wait for me,</i>

51
00:05:17,997 --> 00:05:21,477
<i>I'm forgetting you slowly.</i>

52
00:05:22,317 --> 00:05:25,757
<i>Eurydice, Life is breaking us,</i>

53
00:05:26,157 --> 00:05:29,437
<i>and you can never start anew.</i>

54
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:32,397
- Who's that?
- Malicki.

55
00:05:33,236 --> 00:05:35,994
- What about Leszczyc?
- He no longer lives there.

56
00:05:36,037 --> 00:05:37,055
Let me through!

57
00:05:37,076 --> 00:05:38,636
- Your name?
- Leszczyc.

58
00:05:38,757 --> 00:05:39,917
Let's go.

59
00:05:45,557 --> 00:05:46,797
Breathe.

60
00:05:47,677 --> 00:05:48,917
A bit to the left.

61
00:05:49,077 --> 00:05:50,077
OK.

62
00:05:50,637 --> 00:05:51,757
Next.

63
00:05:53,477 --> 00:05:55,237
- Your name's Leszczyc?
- Yes.

64
00:05:55,437 --> 00:05:56,837
Leszczyc - no changes.

65
00:06:01,757 --> 00:06:03,687
Sometimes they take you
straight away,

66
00:06:03,712 --> 00:06:06,031
you only have time
to get your things.

67
00:06:06,677 --> 00:06:08,637
- Leszczyc!
- Here!

68
00:06:12,357 --> 00:06:13,517
Closer!

69
00:06:15,357 --> 00:06:16,717
Come closer!

70
00:06:20,997 --> 00:06:22,397
Well, don't overdo it.

71
00:06:22,797 --> 00:06:24,856
There is a circle there.

72
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,317
Three steps back!

73
00:06:27,597 --> 00:06:28,757
<i>...oval face...</i>

74
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,631
- Age?
- 24.

75
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:34,014
- Marital status?
- Single.

76
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,517
- Identification marks?
- None.

77
00:06:36,717 --> 00:06:39,197
- Where are your certificates?
- Which ones?

78
00:06:39,748 --> 00:06:42,289
You always bring
a suitcase full of certificates.

79
00:06:42,332 --> 00:06:46,000
Troubles with kidneys, liver,
flat feet, crazy, six toes...

80
00:06:46,025 --> 00:06:48,945
- Anything interesting this time?
- Nothing.

81
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:50,810
A new method.

82
00:06:53,077 --> 00:06:54,277
Turn right.

83
00:06:55,557 --> 00:06:57,237
Hand over the right eye.

84
00:06:58,569 --> 00:06:59,689
A.

85
00:07:00,343 --> 00:07:01,383
E.

86
00:07:02,517 --> 00:07:03,677
K.

87
00:07:04,774 --> 00:07:06,014
Open your eyes.

88
00:07:06,557 --> 00:07:08,797
- Any ailments?
- None.

89
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:11,724
What's that scar on your leg?

90
00:07:11,957 --> 00:07:14,451
It's from my childhood.
I was playing with a spade...

91
00:07:14,494 --> 00:07:17,374
- All right.
- ...and somewhat unfortunately...

92
00:07:17,797 --> 00:07:19,077
Fit and healthy.

93
00:07:19,597 --> 00:07:23,117
So, Andrzej Leszczyc, the son
of Stanislaw, university graduate,

94
00:07:24,237 --> 00:07:26,056
upon completing his studies

95
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,250
was due for 3-month
military training.

96
00:07:28,293 --> 00:07:31,573
Andrzej Leszczyc
did not report for the training.

97
00:07:31,797 --> 00:07:34,277
This can be classified
as desertion.

98
00:07:35,437 --> 00:07:38,317
We enquired
at the faculty of ich...

99
00:07:39,277 --> 00:07:41,877
...ich... thyology and were told,

100
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,554
that Leszczyc also failed

101
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:45,615
to report for the topic of his thesis

102
00:07:45,658 --> 00:07:48,111
and was thus struck
from the student register.

103
00:07:48,154 --> 00:07:49,274
Therefore, Leszczyc,

104
00:07:49,317 --> 00:07:51,877
who was unwilling
to do the 3-month training,

105
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,634
is now due for
2-year military service instead.

106
00:07:54,677 --> 00:07:56,637
He is not sick.

107
00:07:57,117 --> 00:07:59,637
He is not the only family provider.

108
00:07:59,797 --> 00:08:02,997
There are no grounds
for exempting you.

109
00:08:04,557 --> 00:08:06,637
I want to join the army.

110
00:08:08,837 --> 00:08:10,357
The new method.

111
00:08:18,877 --> 00:08:20,074
How is it, comrade?

112
00:08:20,117 --> 00:08:22,394
The State spent on you
a lot of money,

113
00:08:22,437 --> 00:08:25,033
to give you the chance
to study your favourite...

114
00:08:25,058 --> 00:08:27,338
...ich... thyology

115
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:31,517
so now you could pay that back
the State back by working as...

116
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:34,963
I was to work
in a provincial museum.

117
00:08:35,077 --> 00:08:37,797
- As a deputy director.
- A director.

118
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,294
What's up?

119
00:08:41,777 --> 00:08:43,977
Yeah. We don't have
many directors

120
00:08:44,397 --> 00:08:46,757
...of ich... thyological museums.

121
00:08:47,557 --> 00:08:48,717
All right.

122
00:08:49,317 --> 00:08:51,717
And you refuse
to do it for the State.

123
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:55,877
No... it's not that... I enrolled...
to study to escape...

124
00:08:56,277 --> 00:08:57,722
the military service.

125
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,986
I thought, that I'll lose 2 years
of my life in the army.

126
00:09:01,317 --> 00:09:03,317
And... the discipline...

127
00:09:03,637 --> 00:09:05,597
Somehow, I've always managed...

128
00:09:05,877 --> 00:09:08,237
to lie low...
to do bulletin boards.

129
00:09:08,352 --> 00:09:10,657
It's my invention.
I didn't have to study,

130
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,114
doing bulletins on Red Cross,
Women's League.

131
00:09:13,157 --> 00:09:16,391
At school they said I have a
talent, but that it wasn't enough,

132
00:09:16,434 --> 00:09:17,434
to study Art.

133
00:09:17,477 --> 00:09:20,554
And my writing wasn't good enough,
to study journalism.

134
00:09:20,597 --> 00:09:21,837
So, I no longer cared:

135
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,834
board bulletins at ichthyology
or doing bug science...

136
00:09:24,877 --> 00:09:26,900
You should have forced
me to do my service then.

137
00:09:26,943 --> 00:09:27,943
Watch out!

138
00:09:27,986 --> 00:09:30,042
Why didn't you go
for those 3 months?

139
00:09:30,157 --> 00:09:31,157
I couldn't.

140
00:09:31,477 --> 00:09:33,917
I had to... somehow
arrange everything.

141
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,290
My life.

142
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:37,685
I thought I can't postpone it
for an hour,

143
00:09:37,728 --> 00:09:39,048
let alone three months.

144
00:09:39,117 --> 00:09:42,597
Leszczyc, what's this nonsense
you are telling us?

145
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:44,957
Has anything happened?

146
00:09:45,638 --> 00:09:48,278
You all stand in this circle,
with bare bottoms,

147
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:52,619
and you want me to distinguish
a grown up man from just a squirt.

148
00:09:52,757 --> 00:09:55,994
Now Leszczyc tells us,
that he is not ready for life yet.

149
00:09:56,037 --> 00:09:58,277
But he showed us that
five years ago!

150
00:09:59,094 --> 00:10:00,814
That's what you can do to me.

151
00:10:06,477 --> 00:10:08,738
- When is the next transport?
- Today.

152
00:10:08,781 --> 00:10:12,218
- Where to?
- Kolobrzeg, at 3.10 p.m..

153
00:10:20,357 --> 00:10:23,917
Leszczyc, a small suitcase
with personal belongings.

154
00:10:24,361 --> 00:10:26,714
At 1.00 p.m., assembling here,
understood?

155
00:10:26,735 --> 00:10:27,751
Yes, Sir!

156
00:10:27,772 --> 00:10:30,452
- And sober, understood?
- Yes, Sir!

157
00:10:31,357 --> 00:10:32,717
Next.

158
00:10:39,157 --> 00:10:42,117
- Fiszer!
- They've got you.

159
00:10:42,317 --> 00:10:44,677
You've let them to pull
a fast one on you.

160
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,077
We were listening in.

161
00:10:46,317 --> 00:10:48,277
Get going,
you don't have much time.

162
00:10:48,557 --> 00:10:51,797
Say farewell to your loved ones,
have a drink and good bye!

163
00:10:51,957 --> 00:10:53,237
The door!

164
00:11:43,997 --> 00:11:46,317
You fiddled
with the alarm clock again.

165
00:11:47,397 --> 00:11:49,757
You'll sleep when I'm gone.

166
00:11:53,197 --> 00:11:54,957
Good doggie, good boy...

167
00:12:03,237 --> 00:12:05,677
- I'm sorry.
- I can't go out naked!

168
00:12:05,837 --> 00:12:06,837
I said sorry.

169
00:12:07,077 --> 00:12:09,778
- The alarm was set
for before 8:00! - Sorry!

170
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:12,781
- I want to have all the time I need.
- Sorry!

171
00:12:13,117 --> 00:12:15,917
I'm doing the shops behind
the sawmill today.

172
00:12:17,197 --> 00:12:19,717
Near... your library.

173
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:22,045
You must look funny,
nose in a book.

174
00:12:22,237 --> 00:12:23,957
I'd like to see it for once.

175
00:12:29,557 --> 00:12:31,357
A diligent student.

176
00:12:37,437 --> 00:12:39,837
I don't see anything funny in it.

177
00:12:41,837 --> 00:12:43,717
I may be at the dean's office.

178
00:12:44,957 --> 00:12:47,477
Just be there.
I'll find you.

179
00:12:48,797 --> 00:12:51,077
A bit late for this idea.

180
00:12:58,317 --> 00:13:00,477
Come here!
Jump!

181
00:13:01,117 --> 00:13:03,917
Leave the dog,
or I'll hurt my eye.

182
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:07,597
- Good boy...
- The mirror is shaking.

183
00:13:08,046 --> 00:13:09,966
The caretaker said that...

184
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:12,681
the dog's got rabies.

185
00:13:13,797 --> 00:13:15,197
Nonsense...

186
00:13:15,717 --> 00:13:18,877
these... small dogs...
Dog!

187
00:13:22,317 --> 00:13:24,277
Good dog.

188
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:27,157
Yeah...

189
00:13:30,037 --> 00:13:32,237
...these little dogs
don't get rabies.

190
00:13:32,877 --> 00:13:34,157
Don't they?

191
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,437
Don't they?

192
00:13:36,837 --> 00:13:40,517
Should've vaccinated him.
There's an epidemic.

193
00:13:45,557 --> 00:13:48,114
- You won't fool them anyhow.
- About what?

194
00:13:48,157 --> 00:13:50,037
That you have big eyes.

195
00:13:55,757 --> 00:13:58,157
You'll make me late again.

196
00:14:00,557 --> 00:14:03,237
You could be ready to leave
in three minutes.

197
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:06,357
I could be ready to leave...

198
00:14:06,957 --> 00:14:08,517
...in one minute.

199
00:14:13,677 --> 00:14:15,317
Once forever.

200
00:14:16,237 --> 00:14:17,797
Forever...

201
00:14:18,477 --> 00:14:21,157
Each time one leaves
it's forever.

202
00:14:24,117 --> 00:14:26,357
- Do we have honey?
- I don't know.

203
00:14:26,957 --> 00:14:30,597
<i>...easy to remember.
Who wrote it for you?</i>

204
00:14:31,077 --> 00:14:32,237
<i>Well?</i>

205
00:14:32,637 --> 00:14:35,637
<i>Johann Sebastian Bach!</i>

206
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:42,357
<i>Johann Sebastian Bach lived
long time ago. And he died.</i>

207
00:14:42,637 --> 00:14:44,077
I'm off to work.

208
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,237
I'm not 19.
Must take care of my looks.

209
00:14:49,797 --> 00:14:52,797
You are not 19,
You are off to work...

210
00:14:56,037 --> 00:14:58,197
<i>You are not 19...</i>

211
00:15:04,277 --> 00:15:06,037
What a sad song.

212
00:15:06,797 --> 00:15:08,077
BACH!

213
00:15:09,517 --> 00:15:10,757
What was that?

214
00:15:10,957 --> 00:15:12,837
Your favourite mayonnaise.

215
00:15:13,197 --> 00:15:15,277
Clean it up before you go to sleep.

216
00:15:16,121 --> 00:15:17,881
Come here, come on.

217
00:15:18,727 --> 00:15:21,440
Your mistress gave you breakfast.

218
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:25,957
Kiss your husband goodnight.

219
00:15:28,397 --> 00:15:31,978
You could sweep the floor.
Look how messy it's here.

220
00:15:40,437 --> 00:15:41,557
Three yoghurts.

221
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:45,917
A pot of honey.
Bread.

222
00:16:11,517 --> 00:16:12,597
Fifty four.

223
00:16:12,656 --> 00:16:15,613
I've only got fifty. I'll take
one cauliflower less.

224
00:16:15,797 --> 00:16:17,997
That'll be fifty.

225
00:16:18,997 --> 00:16:20,517
And radishes?

226
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,717
Here we are.

227
00:16:24,045 --> 00:16:25,597
One loaf of bread, please.

228
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,194
- A dark one or a white one?
- Doesn't matter.

229
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,892
It's for a blind man.

230
00:16:30,037 --> 00:16:34,397
My, you always come up
with things like that...

231
00:16:34,557 --> 00:16:37,237
- Yes, dearie.
- Well, say something.

232
00:16:37,477 --> 00:16:39,277
- Something.
- What?

233
00:16:39,335 --> 00:16:42,245
You wanted me to say something,
so I said something.

234
00:16:42,288 --> 00:16:44,288
Oh, go on, when you say
something...

235
00:16:46,197 --> 00:16:49,597
Remember the address:
1, Pretty Street.

236
00:16:52,517 --> 00:16:56,197
Mister! Your dog!
He's frothing at the mouth!

237
00:18:29,117 --> 00:18:31,754
- Where're you going?
- It'll be all right here.

238
00:18:31,797 --> 00:18:35,202
- The chimney's smoking.- Not here.
- And it will keep the wind out.

239
00:18:35,245 --> 00:18:36,434
He must be at home.

240
00:18:36,477 --> 00:18:38,637
What's the time? Ten.
He'll be asleep.

241
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,079
Nobody in. Look, his things are
packed. He must be going away.

242
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:45,649
- There's a suitcase on the bed.
- Wait, I'll fetch a blanket.

243
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,317
Well, now.

244
00:19:14,477 --> 00:19:16,277
- Taking off you bra?
- Why not?

245
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,674
And if they come back?

246
00:19:17,717 --> 00:19:21,511
She's working, and he's cooking dinners
or something. At this time he's asleep.

247
00:19:21,554 --> 00:19:23,670
If he's packed,
he might be moving out.

248
00:19:23,713 --> 00:19:26,788
- He's seen me already.
- I met him a couple of times as well.

249
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:29,794
- No, I mean naked!
- Never! You've been there?

250
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:33,071
No, just sunbathing. It's a nice
place. I come here often.

251
00:19:33,114 --> 00:19:34,754
- Well?
- Nothing. He's seen me.

252
00:19:34,797 --> 00:19:37,157
- And what? Did you know?
- What?

253
00:19:37,357 --> 00:19:39,037
- That he saw you.
- Of course!

254
00:19:39,197 --> 00:19:40,877
- Never!
- Who cares.

255
00:19:41,037 --> 00:19:44,077
- But... his wife!
- What wife? They live together.

256
00:19:44,437 --> 00:19:46,077
- And...?
- What? - With him.

257
00:19:46,277 --> 00:19:48,314
They've live together
for two years.

258
00:19:48,357 --> 00:19:51,074
- And then, when he saw you?
- Nothing, she arrived.

259
00:19:51,117 --> 00:19:53,524
- Was there a fight?
- I don't think she's seen me.

260
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,803
I don't know, what's the score.
Who and whom...

261
00:19:55,846 --> 00:19:57,074
I mean:
who cares more.

262
00:19:57,117 --> 00:20:00,317
- What if she comes now?
- So what? Can't we sunbathe?

263
00:20:03,517 --> 00:20:05,037
The chimney's smoking.

264
00:20:07,944 --> 00:20:09,104
They're at home!

265
00:20:18,197 --> 00:20:21,597
Quiet! Stop it!
Quiet! Go there!

266
00:20:21,917 --> 00:20:23,277
Go there! Quiet!

267
00:20:29,997 --> 00:20:32,397
- What a lovely doggie!
- Indeed!

268
00:20:33,197 --> 00:20:34,997
The vet's gone to see horses.

269
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:37,991
- What's wrong with him?
- You'll have to wait.

270
00:20:38,034 --> 00:20:39,714
Could I go in first?

271
00:20:39,757 --> 00:20:42,357
I'm afraid
that he might have rabies...

272
00:20:42,997 --> 00:20:44,157
You don't say!

273
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,277
Such a little dog...

274
00:20:47,317 --> 00:20:49,197
- Did you vaccinate him?
- No.

275
00:20:49,357 --> 00:20:50,557
Nice little doggie...

276
00:20:51,157 --> 00:20:52,794
Oh, here's the vet now.

277
00:20:52,837 --> 00:20:54,517
- He's coming.
- Yes.

278
00:20:54,877 --> 00:20:56,717
I don't mind, you go in first.

279
00:20:57,517 --> 00:21:00,357
- Yes...
- Follow the doctor.

280
00:21:00,471 --> 00:21:02,071
Here, to the left.

281
00:21:03,237 --> 00:21:05,517
What a long queue...

282
00:21:11,677 --> 00:21:14,437
Doctor, I'm afraid
it might have been froth.

283
00:21:15,437 --> 00:21:17,637
- Was he vaccinated?
- No.

284
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:21,437
Well, and you come now...?

285
00:21:30,237 --> 00:21:33,117
Unfortunately,
he'll have to be, you know...

286
00:21:33,357 --> 00:21:34,565
He'd only suffer.

287
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:36,826
- I'll put him to sleep now.
- How come?

288
00:21:37,077 --> 00:21:38,157
Perhaps...

289
00:21:38,437 --> 00:21:40,797
There's an epidemic.
It was in the papers.

290
00:21:40,997 --> 00:21:44,117
Rabies doesn't happen often,
but now... Unfortunately.

291
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:48,714
Couldn't you do something?
There are some ways. Maybe...

292
00:21:48,757 --> 00:21:49,757
...some...

293
00:21:49,957 --> 00:21:52,357
What are you talking about...

294
00:21:52,677 --> 00:21:54,757
- Did he bite anybody?
- No.

295
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,285
- Shall I get him ready
for injection? - Yes.

296
00:21:57,346 --> 00:21:59,484
You'll have to take him
and bury him...

297
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:02,647
I could do it... but it'll cost.

298
00:22:08,117 --> 00:22:09,637
I don't have any more...

299
00:22:43,037 --> 00:22:45,717
Hello, get out, please!
Get out!

300
00:22:47,397 --> 00:22:49,077
- Sorry!
- 0-9, 0-9!

301
00:22:49,477 --> 00:22:51,637
Can't you see?
There's an accident!

302
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:55,877
A girl was hit by a car!

303
00:23:09,197 --> 00:23:11,037
Come on, let me see.

304
00:23:15,957 --> 00:23:17,613
- Hi!
- What's happened?

305
00:23:17,638 --> 00:23:18,678
I don't know.

306
00:23:20,117 --> 00:23:23,286
Don't like watching things like
that. Let's go for a drink.

307
00:23:23,307 --> 00:23:24,394
I don't drink.

308
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:26,677
I'm meeting a guy
who owes me money.

309
00:23:28,037 --> 00:23:29,197
Nice guy.

310
00:23:31,317 --> 00:23:34,357
He's a car doctor.
If you have a car, he's your man.

311
00:23:35,757 --> 00:23:37,437
Mundek?

312
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:41,317
You were the head of the Youth
Association in our school?

313
00:23:41,997 --> 00:23:45,237
- What?
- Watch out or you'll get run over.

314
00:23:52,517 --> 00:23:53,557
Hi.

315
00:23:54,477 --> 00:23:55,597
All right.

316
00:24:01,917 --> 00:24:05,077
Change it at the bar and
bring us some coffee. My friend.

317
00:24:06,837 --> 00:24:08,357
Three coffees, please.

318
00:24:09,957 --> 00:24:12,637
What was that stuff
with the Youth Association?

319
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:14,677
Old times.

320
00:24:14,957 --> 00:24:17,837
You had better marks,
and never did a thing.

321
00:24:22,372 --> 00:24:24,492
When I was little
I looked in a mirror

322
00:24:24,517 --> 00:24:27,477
and imagined
that I'm a girl. Silly, huh?

323
00:24:28,197 --> 00:24:30,629
- Naked?
- I wore my sister's stockings.

324
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:32,002
Silly, huh?

325
00:24:33,677 --> 00:24:37,917
I was nineteen..., no twenty
when I first saw a naked woman.

326
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:40,677
I was bathed together
with my sister.

327
00:24:41,237 --> 00:24:43,317
Go on.
The one with the stockings?

328
00:24:43,597 --> 00:24:45,913
The younger one.
The other one was older.

329
00:24:45,956 --> 00:24:47,156
She was crossed-eyed.

330
00:24:47,357 --> 00:24:49,597
- Which one?
- Actually, both of them.

331
00:24:50,917 --> 00:24:53,717
The older one was worse.
I'm squinting too.

332
00:24:54,037 --> 00:24:55,197
You can see.

333
00:24:56,357 --> 00:24:57,477
I don't know.

334
00:24:57,837 --> 00:25:00,437
- Can't you see?
- No.

335
00:25:00,847 --> 00:25:03,087
Like my father.
The theory of the genes.

336
00:25:03,637 --> 00:25:05,717
He couldn't doubt his fatherhood.

337
00:25:05,957 --> 00:25:08,874
- You can see it a little.
- When you look sideways.

338
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:11,157
They call me Picas.
Silly, huh?

339
00:25:11,182 --> 00:25:12,702
Don't look sideways.

340
00:25:14,077 --> 00:25:15,597
- 90...
- Why Picas?

341
00:25:15,877 --> 00:25:17,557
One eye here, another there.

342
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:18,797
90 what?

343
00:25:19,037 --> 00:25:21,677
- Bust! The one in a jumper!
- What?!

344
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:24,557
You've got an eye!

345
00:25:26,077 --> 00:25:28,917
- The one in a jumper. See?!
- What an eye!

346
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,045
I can read what's written
over there.

347
00:25:31,088 --> 00:25:34,234
A-man-at-the-station-who-says-
I-don't-know-why-I-came-here-

348
00:25:34,277 --> 00:25:35,754
- ...after-many-years...
- Where?!

349
00:25:35,797 --> 00:25:37,834
...or-after-something-
like-youth-or-love...

350
00:25:37,877 --> 00:25:39,757
Over there, the green poster!

351
00:25:39,917 --> 00:25:41,277
Is it an advert or what?

352
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,971
I thought you'd see double.

353
00:25:43,014 --> 00:25:44,994
They didn't even exempt me
from the army.

354
00:25:45,037 --> 00:25:46,637
I could read
the smallest letters.

355
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,514
You could've pretended, that you
don't see the largest ones.

356
00:25:49,557 --> 00:25:53,277
Everybody expects that.
But I have better sight than others.

357
00:25:56,517 --> 00:25:59,397
They thought you'd learnt
the letters by heart.

358
00:25:59,757 --> 00:26:01,397
- 150.
- Where?!

359
00:26:01,677 --> 00:26:03,037
These two. Together!

360
00:26:03,237 --> 00:26:06,063
You could make one good one
from those two.

361
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,706
I'd marry her.
And you?

362
00:26:07,797 --> 00:26:11,237
You've changed a 500 note but
didn't give the change back!

363
00:26:11,477 --> 00:26:12,877
The change, mate.

364
00:26:13,357 --> 00:26:15,437
I've married a 92.

365
00:26:17,357 --> 00:26:19,117
- That's rare.
- True.

366
00:26:19,357 --> 00:26:21,317
- Is the wife older than you?
- Why?

367
00:26:21,517 --> 00:26:23,806
I presumed
that she's older and has money.

368
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:25,954
You don't look bad
and you don't work.

369
00:26:25,997 --> 00:26:29,317
Maybe I'm on holiday.
Maybe I'll get a divorce.

370
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,262
My mate was on holiday. The wife
was gone when he came back.

371
00:26:32,305 --> 00:26:34,945
- I'm doing my Masters.
- You're a fool.

372
00:26:35,997 --> 00:26:38,776
You studied something, right?
Graduated in...

373
00:26:38,837 --> 00:26:41,127
I had problems.
Now I'm writing my thesis.

374
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,086
- What is it?
- Well, ichthyology.

375
00:26:43,129 --> 00:26:45,169
- Yes, ichthyol ointment!
- 95!

376
00:26:45,797 --> 00:26:47,957
- Exaggeration!
- You'd bonk her!

377
00:26:47,985 --> 00:26:49,545
Who wouldn't!

378
00:26:50,037 --> 00:26:52,317
You don't sit in an office either.

379
00:26:53,277 --> 00:26:55,317
I'm a hunter.
I hunt suckers.

380
00:26:56,157 --> 00:26:58,037
I ring a bell and do my show bit.

381
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,686
The give me a photo
and some advance.

382
00:27:01,132 --> 00:27:04,092
In 3 days they get a portrait
and I get the money.

383
00:27:04,117 --> 00:27:06,997
And if the husband's out,
I may get something more.

384
00:27:07,237 --> 00:27:08,757
Shit, I must make a call.

385
00:27:09,037 --> 00:27:11,907
- The phone is over there.
- Wait, the number.

386
00:27:14,157 --> 00:27:16,157
Well, I'll be...!

387
00:27:17,037 --> 00:27:18,557
What a broad!

388
00:27:24,866 --> 00:27:25,946
Yes, that's me...

389
00:27:26,597 --> 00:27:28,637
This one's about a hundred.

390
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:32,270
L. Janczewska, 3, Pretty Street.

391
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:35,037
That's the one
he's calling now. Nice job!

392
00:27:37,237 --> 00:27:39,197
- Janczewska?
- Yes.

393
00:27:40,317 --> 00:27:41,997
No, her first name is...

394
00:27:45,189 --> 00:27:49,029
You're a sucker. You'll graduate.
You're married. And what for?

395
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,511
I'll be a museum director.
A deputy director.

396
00:27:51,554 --> 00:27:53,834
In the province?
Cinema once a week,

397
00:27:53,877 --> 00:27:57,740
bridge with the pharmacist
and one hooker for the whole city.

398
00:27:58,158 --> 00:28:01,231
If you don't marry for money,
you marry for the sake of others.

399
00:28:01,274 --> 00:28:04,394
Thousands of guys like us
are sitting now in coffee bars

400
00:28:04,437 --> 00:28:06,677
and thinking
how to bonk your wife.

401
00:28:07,397 --> 00:28:09,477
And one's probably
doing it right now.

402
00:28:10,116 --> 00:28:11,914
That Janczewska's not bad, huh?

403
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:14,517
Married one year.
I offer to do her portrait

404
00:28:14,757 --> 00:28:17,677
and after an hour
she won't let me get my pants on.

405
00:28:18,237 --> 00:28:20,757
- Nice job.
- <i>C'est la vie!</i>

406
00:28:21,837 --> 00:28:24,077
- I'm off to work.
- To Janczewska?

407
00:28:24,397 --> 00:28:27,477
I'm a bit weak in the knees
after yesterday.

408
00:28:29,077 --> 00:28:30,957
Nice job!

409
00:28:32,437 --> 00:28:36,077
But you've got the have the looks.
Damn it!

410
00:28:37,637 --> 00:28:40,357
- Let's go. The coffee's been paid.
- Mundek!

411
00:28:41,517 --> 00:28:42,917
Lend me a hundred.

412
00:28:48,917 --> 00:28:51,554
You've got me.
Call me, the number's in the book.

413
00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:53,594
Nice job, you've got yourself
a phone.

414
00:28:53,637 --> 00:28:55,842
Others have degrees
and I've got a phone.

415
00:28:55,885 --> 00:28:57,554
You'll pay me back
when you're a director.

416
00:28:57,597 --> 00:28:59,037
She's called Janczewska now?

417
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,117
- Why?
- Just asking. She got married?

418
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,357
- Do you know her?
- No.

419
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,571
- What's that 100 for?
- I must buy an envelope.

420
00:29:04,614 --> 00:29:06,014
10 groszy's enough.

421
00:29:09,317 --> 00:29:10,917
I may need more.

422
00:29:11,477 --> 00:29:13,157
- See you.
- See you.

423
00:29:23,957 --> 00:29:26,237
No business after eleven.

424
00:29:28,397 --> 00:29:30,877
<i>Hello, Department of ichthyology.</i>

425
00:29:31,717 --> 00:29:34,037
<i>Why so late?
What is it?</i>

426
00:29:34,237 --> 00:29:37,060
I only wanted my record book.
I've been drafted.

427
00:29:37,637 --> 00:29:41,442
<i>No... it's only
in the interest of decency...</i>

428
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:45,594
They've got you at last.
Can't give you your record book.

429
00:29:45,637 --> 00:29:48,474
Only a certificate,
that you've completed something.

430
00:29:48,525 --> 00:29:50,944
And that you've been expelled.

431
00:29:52,102 --> 00:29:53,317
<i>Explain to me, why?</i>

432
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,274
How many years
have you completed?

433
00:29:55,317 --> 00:29:56,437
Four.

434
00:29:56,677 --> 00:29:58,117
You must've messed it up.

435
00:29:58,317 --> 00:30:00,717
To get expelled
just before the degree.

436
00:30:01,637 --> 00:30:03,677
I didn't report for
the thesis topic.

437
00:30:04,006 --> 00:30:06,406
- Why?
- I don't like fish.

438
00:30:07,568 --> 00:30:10,648
<i>- I have the right to know!</i>
- When are you to report?

439
00:30:11,037 --> 00:30:12,251
- At once.
<i>- Nonsense.</i>

440
00:30:12,282 --> 00:30:16,202
- Leaving at three. Going fishing.
- What do you mean?

441
00:30:16,623 --> 00:30:18,449
Well, to the seaside...

442
00:30:18,894 --> 00:30:20,476
They've assigned me
to the Marines.

443
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:23,154
<i>I can understand everything.
I can forgive you a lot.</i>

444
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:26,477
That's correct.
Since 1961 you didn't...

445
00:30:26,997 --> 00:30:29,477
...report for your thesis topic.

446
00:30:29,717 --> 00:30:30,837
Expelled.

447
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:33,077
<i>I forgave you many things,
but this?</i>

448
00:30:33,437 --> 00:30:34,797
<i>No, that's not possible!</i>

449
00:30:34,957 --> 00:30:36,877
What were you doing
those 2 years?

450
00:30:38,237 --> 00:30:40,277
I have a huge favour
to ask you...

451
00:30:41,797 --> 00:30:44,677
I told the wife,
that I'll be here at noon...

452
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:46,237
...about my diploma.

453
00:30:46,397 --> 00:30:48,357
- She doesn't know...
<i>- But this?</i>

454
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,954
...I'm not studying any more.

455
00:30:49,997 --> 00:30:52,765
Now I know, what you were doing
those two years.

456
00:30:52,808 --> 00:30:54,035
She'll come here.

457
00:30:55,237 --> 00:30:57,637
<i>- Wait! Hello!</i>
- I'll wait here for a while.

458
00:30:57,917 --> 00:31:00,677
But, just in case,
don't tell her anything.

459
00:31:00,997 --> 00:31:04,997
About the military service.
Tell her to go straight home.

460
00:31:47,677 --> 00:31:50,437
- Have you got a pen?
- I do. Why?

461
00:31:50,957 --> 00:31:53,157
Will you write something for me?

462
00:31:53,397 --> 00:31:55,717
- Here?
- Here's not possible. Over here.

463
00:31:55,877 --> 00:31:58,757
- What are you looking at?
- I knew a girl like you.

464
00:31:59,295 --> 00:32:01,529
Go on then.
Start with "Darling", yes?

465
00:32:01,674 --> 00:32:03,274
- No...
- "Dear Madame"?

466
00:32:03,317 --> 00:32:05,194
"I'm going away for a long time."

467
00:32:05,237 --> 00:32:07,650
I've explained everything
to my friend...,

468
00:32:07,693 --> 00:32:09,554
...who'll give you this letter...

469
00:32:09,597 --> 00:32:11,674
- What name should I sign?
- No name.

470
00:32:11,717 --> 00:32:12,994
You'll put 3 crosses?

471
00:32:13,037 --> 00:32:14,917
Now the envelope:
Lena Janczewska.

472
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:16,717
3, Pretty Street.

473
00:32:16,957 --> 00:32:18,557
- Pretty?
- Number 3.

474
00:32:18,757 --> 00:32:21,514
- I'm asking about Lena.
- I don't even know her.

475
00:32:21,557 --> 00:32:24,549
And you're on first-name terms
with her? It's not you!

476
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:27,194
You wanted to kill me,
so it won't be revealed!

477
00:32:32,037 --> 00:32:33,597
- I was kidding!
- Me too.

478
00:32:33,837 --> 00:32:36,077
My friend fancies that Lena.

479
00:32:36,317 --> 00:32:38,973
In this way he can get
to know her better.

480
00:32:39,317 --> 00:32:43,077
I hope, he'll succeed.
Sign: Mundek.

481
00:32:43,557 --> 00:32:45,237
Maybe not. Rajmund.

482
00:32:45,917 --> 00:32:47,717
Not a nice name.

483
00:32:48,237 --> 00:32:51,397
- I'm Basia. Barbara.
- What are you doing here?

484
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,879
I can't wait for the lectures
to start. I got enrolled.

485
00:32:54,922 --> 00:32:57,042
- To read what?
- Ichthyology.

486
00:32:57,197 --> 00:33:00,437
Do you know what it is?
Fish science.

487
00:33:01,877 --> 00:33:03,557
I come from the coast.

488
00:33:03,912 --> 00:33:06,392
I can't wait
for the lectures to start.

489
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,332
I was in the Highlands
and now I'm going home, to Slupsk.

490
00:33:10,357 --> 00:33:12,215
You have a train at three.

491
00:33:12,397 --> 00:33:13,397
How do you know?

492
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,874
I'm sure to surprise you
more than once.

493
00:33:15,917 --> 00:33:17,077
Well?

494
00:33:17,717 --> 00:33:22,437
- Maybe I walk with you?
- Well, surprise me!

495
00:33:30,477 --> 00:33:34,197
<i>Salmo salar pluviatikis:</i>
an exceptionally rare salmon

496
00:33:34,248 --> 00:33:36,572
that has most peculiar habits.

497
00:33:37,197 --> 00:33:42,197
Once a year all fish swim
to one and the same place,

498
00:33:42,477 --> 00:33:45,997
where they meet
as if they'd have an appointment

499
00:33:47,037 --> 00:33:50,734
for a date or a wedding night...

500
00:33:52,145 --> 00:33:55,654
This romanticism was their doom.

501
00:33:56,797 --> 00:34:00,397
Fishermen...
discovered this place.

502
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:18,877
Grass consumption per capita.

503
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:22,059
If each man in the world
would eat...

504
00:34:23,517 --> 00:34:24,957
Do you like dogs?

505
00:34:25,357 --> 00:34:27,997
You looked
like a bulldog. Like this...

506
00:34:28,997 --> 00:34:31,117
I can look even worse.

507
00:34:38,397 --> 00:34:39,757
You win.

508
00:34:43,117 --> 00:34:44,717
It's twelve o'clock!

509
00:34:47,677 --> 00:34:50,717
Yes. I've only got an hour.
I have to hurry.

510
00:34:51,717 --> 00:34:55,157
- Where are you going?
- I work here.

511
00:34:56,797 --> 00:35:01,477
It's nearby so... sometimes I climb
over the fence...

512
00:35:02,197 --> 00:35:04,077
to listen about fish.

513
00:35:06,277 --> 00:35:09,517
You're making it up.

514
00:35:36,957 --> 00:35:38,357
Where are you?

515
00:35:40,917 --> 00:35:42,397
Well, where are you?

516
00:35:43,997 --> 00:35:47,757
- Why are you following me?
- And why are you like this?

517
00:35:48,077 --> 00:35:50,757
You pretend all the time.
You don't work here.

518
00:35:51,077 --> 00:35:54,437
And such a salmon
as <i>Salmo salar </i>does not exist.

519
00:35:55,477 --> 00:35:57,908
I wasn't listening
carefully to the lecture.

520
00:35:57,951 --> 00:36:00,511
I'm a working man.
Tired and inattentive.

521
00:36:00,554 --> 00:36:02,674
You are a working man?
My father...

522
00:36:02,717 --> 00:36:04,637
I like watching people work.

523
00:36:06,105 --> 00:36:08,757
I'd like to be a photographer,
and photograph people at work.

524
00:36:08,782 --> 00:36:11,716
I always wanted to work
or take photos. Do you know?

525
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:14,354
We are not on first name terms.

526
00:36:14,397 --> 00:36:18,517
Look: these logs
are pulled in through here...

527
00:36:19,357 --> 00:36:24,837
These planks are cut further into
small bits - matches, toothpicks...

528
00:36:27,157 --> 00:36:30,077
It's nice here, isn't it?
It smells nice.

529
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,517
Have you ever looked at a match?

530
00:36:34,717 --> 00:36:37,797
Tonight... at dawn,
I struck a match.

531
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,230
It was like
seeing it for the first time.

532
00:36:40,273 --> 00:36:41,513
The match?

533
00:36:41,917 --> 00:36:45,457
- You're pulling my leg again.
- A match is a beautiful thing.

534
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,772
So are you.
The future is.

535
00:36:47,797 --> 00:36:51,277
Generally, many things. Huge
logs. Matches made of them.

536
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,994
How do you know
what time is my train?

537
00:36:54,037 --> 00:36:57,757
'Cos I work on the railway.
I'm the one who walks and taps.

538
00:36:58,597 --> 00:37:00,957
Taps the wagon wheels:
knock, knock...

539
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,234
You're silly.

540
00:37:02,277 --> 00:37:03,354
Wait a minute.

541
00:37:03,397 --> 00:37:06,294
When you'll be leaving,
you'll see me at the station.

542
00:37:06,337 --> 00:37:09,637
I'll be wearing a special uniform.
Or maybe not.

543
00:37:09,877 --> 00:37:11,837
But I'll tap for you for sure.

544
00:37:15,046 --> 00:37:17,640
It was you who run up the steps
after me!

545
00:37:17,683 --> 00:37:20,594
You wanted to borrow a pen!
Why did you run after me?

546
00:37:20,637 --> 00:37:22,837
- I wanted to borrow a pen!
- Well?

547
00:37:23,797 --> 00:37:26,277
- I borrowed it!
- So what?

548
00:37:29,037 --> 00:37:30,477
So what?!

549
00:37:34,037 --> 00:37:36,597
I've got something in my eye!

550
00:37:36,757 --> 00:37:38,197
My eye!

551
00:37:38,677 --> 00:37:40,077
No, I'll do it!

552
00:37:40,477 --> 00:37:42,197
Wait, stop fidgeting!

553
00:37:42,557 --> 00:37:44,357
- No... It hurts!
- Wait!

554
00:37:47,357 --> 00:37:48,637
There's nothing there.

555
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:52,197
And what?

556
00:37:53,197 --> 00:37:54,866
I gave you the pen back.

557
00:37:54,909 --> 00:37:57,514
I run up to you,
because I took you for...

558
00:37:57,557 --> 00:37:59,397
...an old friend of mine...

559
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:02,477
She looked like you.
She did.

560
00:38:03,117 --> 00:38:04,517
Where's she now?

561
00:38:04,837 --> 00:38:06,837
I don't know.
She graduated in Art.

562
00:38:07,397 --> 00:38:11,117
After...
She does some window dressing.

563
00:38:12,637 --> 00:38:14,401
She thinks something,
does something.

564
00:38:14,444 --> 00:38:17,474
She's no longer like you.
What does it mean "like you"?

565
00:38:17,517 --> 00:38:19,997
Generally,
all girls are like you.

566
00:38:20,157 --> 00:38:23,077
Even at the coffee bar...
my friend...

567
00:38:23,903 --> 00:38:25,452
showed me a portrait of this...

568
00:38:25,477 --> 00:38:27,797
- Banasiuk! Throw!
- Do you smoke?

569
00:38:28,917 --> 00:38:31,797
- So, we'll meet at the station.
- No smoking here.

570
00:38:33,757 --> 00:38:35,117
No smoking here.

571
00:38:35,597 --> 00:38:37,157
Excuse me!

572
00:38:38,778 --> 00:38:40,197
Does he come here often?

573
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,437
These students?
They come to earn some money.

574
00:39:21,237 --> 00:39:24,637
Excuse me... My wife was meant
to be somewhere here.

575
00:39:25,477 --> 00:39:26,997
He's asking about his wife.

576
00:39:27,717 --> 00:39:29,277
What wife?

577
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:31,997
His wife. Must have one.

578
00:39:32,357 --> 00:39:36,157
My wife.
She was to do these shops.

579
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,754
To do what?
Visit? Look at them?

580
00:39:39,797 --> 00:39:41,917
No... She...

581
00:39:42,357 --> 00:39:43,997
was to dress the...

582
00:39:44,477 --> 00:39:45,997
...windows.

583
00:39:46,237 --> 00:39:48,077
- Teresa?
- Yes.

584
00:39:48,357 --> 00:39:50,157
She's go no husband.

585
00:39:50,557 --> 00:39:51,797
Actually, that's me.

586
00:39:52,117 --> 00:39:54,117
- Well, well..
- Well what?

587
00:39:56,197 --> 00:39:58,037
Nothing. I didn't know.

588
00:39:59,157 --> 00:40:01,037
So now you know.

589
00:40:02,837 --> 00:40:06,037
Where... is she now?

590
00:40:07,997 --> 00:40:09,997
I fired her.

591
00:40:10,487 --> 00:40:12,487
What do you mean:
fired her?

592
00:40:13,214 --> 00:40:15,614
You see, in our company

593
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:19,095
we have women artists
who dress shop...

594
00:40:19,477 --> 00:40:20,677
Good afternoon.

595
00:40:20,917 --> 00:40:24,117
...windows and so on.
Somebody has to employ them.

596
00:40:24,397 --> 00:40:26,157
Somebody has to manage them.

597
00:40:26,517 --> 00:40:28,157
Supervise them.

598
00:40:28,597 --> 00:40:29,917
Assign tasks to them.

599
00:40:30,117 --> 00:40:31,877
And fire them. That's me.

600
00:40:32,037 --> 00:40:34,117
So, now you know.
You're welcome.

601
00:40:36,917 --> 00:40:40,597
- Well... where did she...?
- She took her pay and went.

602
00:40:40,877 --> 00:40:42,437
Must be something important.

603
00:40:43,648 --> 00:40:45,437
She must've gone home.

604
00:40:45,874 --> 00:40:47,557
Probably she did.

605
00:40:50,837 --> 00:40:54,517
<i>"Common Case" offers
foreign language courses in:</i>

606
00:40:55,277 --> 00:40:57,877
<i>English, French, German,</i>

607
00:40:58,277 --> 00:41:00,837
<i>Russian, Italian and Spanish.</i>

<i>"Common Case".</i>

611
00:41:17,037 --> 00:41:20,237
...5, 6, 7, 8, 9... 80!

612
00:41:20,637 --> 00:41:26,477
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...
90!

613
00:41:27,317 --> 00:41:32,957
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...
100!

614
00:41:33,277 --> 00:41:39,477
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...
110!

00:41:39,837 --> 00:41:46,557
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9... 120!
- Excuse me.

616
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:52,597
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...
130!

617
00:41:53,037 --> 00:41:59,077
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...
140!

618
00:42:47,837 --> 00:42:49,117
Give me your hand, Sir.

619
00:42:49,277 --> 00:42:52,979
I'll tell you the truth, your
fortune! Give me your hand!

620
00:42:53,077 --> 00:42:55,954
Give me your hand, Sir,
I can see it in your eyes.

621
00:42:55,997 --> 00:42:57,617
I'll tell you the truth!

622
00:43:05,277 --> 00:43:06,597
For 10 zloties.

623
00:43:06,757 --> 00:43:09,033
And if the Gipsy lies
you won't pay.

624
00:43:09,117 --> 00:43:11,037
I'll tell you your name.
It is...

625
00:43:11,197 --> 00:43:12,237
Andrzej.

626
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:14,831
You shouldn't have.
I'd have told you myself.

627
00:43:14,874 --> 00:43:16,554
I didn't want you to be wrong.

628
00:43:16,597 --> 00:43:18,877
Because then I wouldn't have
believed you.

629
00:43:19,281 --> 00:43:22,874
Your mother's name is Maria,
and your father's in a grave, right?

630
00:43:22,917 --> 00:43:25,274
- Is the Gipsy telling the truth?
- Yes.

631
00:43:25,317 --> 00:43:28,037
Then give me 10 zloty.
You won't regret it.

632
00:43:29,237 --> 00:43:32,476
- I haven't got any change.
- I'll change it for you.

633
00:43:33,437 --> 00:43:36,677
- I will.
- That's not enough.

634
00:43:36,997 --> 00:43:38,797
I'll give you more.

635
00:43:42,397 --> 00:43:44,277
I can see in your hand...

636
00:43:44,917 --> 00:43:46,077
no good.

637
00:43:46,877 --> 00:43:49,837
- Probably a journey.
- No good, Sir.

638
00:43:50,357 --> 00:43:52,077
I won't tell you anything.

639
00:43:54,037 --> 00:43:56,637
I don't want anything from you.

640
00:43:57,477 --> 00:43:59,317
<i>I'm sorry, I'm in hurry.</i>

641
00:43:59,877 --> 00:44:01,757
<i>You can see, isn't it?</i>

642
00:44:02,237 --> 00:44:04,157
<i>That's all. Good bye.</i>

643
00:44:05,397 --> 00:44:07,997
<i>Please, slam the door!</i>

644
00:45:58,677 --> 00:46:00,237
O, surprise!

645
00:46:04,997 --> 00:46:07,757
Don't you recognise me?
Wait, it's me...

646
00:46:16,197 --> 00:46:17,997
Do you remember?
On the beach?

647
00:46:18,237 --> 00:46:21,717
You told me to call you "missus".
But you called me by name.

648
00:46:22,117 --> 00:46:23,651
You were learning Spanish.

649
00:46:24,637 --> 00:46:26,494
You've send me
to get ice-cream, right?

650
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:29,304
And whatever you wanted,
because you knew that...

651
00:46:29,877 --> 00:46:30,997
Right?

652
00:47:16,197 --> 00:47:17,437
Yes?

653
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:18,997
Yes!

654
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:20,470
So what?

655
00:47:21,037 --> 00:47:22,117
So what?

656
00:47:22,286 --> 00:47:24,846
So what?!
To start with he was cross-eyed.

657
00:47:25,317 --> 00:47:29,557
Secondly, I've got here our...
You want to talk to him?

658
00:47:30,757 --> 00:47:31,957
Just a minute.

659
00:47:39,813 --> 00:47:43,252
Why're you looking at me like that?
It's not me who makes the bets.

660
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,717
I don't take money.

661
00:47:45,397 --> 00:47:47,917
If Mundek bets,
it's his business.

662
00:47:49,037 --> 00:47:51,157
Do you think,
that he wins every bet?

663
00:47:51,317 --> 00:47:52,517
I don't bet.

664
00:47:52,957 --> 00:47:55,477
Five hundred. It's the stake.

665
00:47:56,197 --> 00:47:58,077
That mate of yours, that...

666
00:47:58,957 --> 00:48:00,877
I kicked him out.

667
00:48:01,717 --> 00:48:04,877
Mundek must be mad
for losing five hundred.

668
00:48:05,317 --> 00:48:07,277
But he'll get it back from you.

669
00:48:07,597 --> 00:48:09,197
I didn't bet.

670
00:48:09,735 --> 00:48:13,095
If he bet five hundred, you must
do it too. That's the stake.

671
00:48:13,837 --> 00:48:15,117
Mundek has these girls.

672
00:48:15,277 --> 00:48:17,735
He shows them and says:
"She likes it".

673
00:48:18,157 --> 00:48:21,216
"If you'd want, you could
have her straight away".

674
00:48:21,477 --> 00:48:23,717
- "Shall we bet"?
- OK. Bet!

675
00:48:24,355 --> 00:48:27,674
You don't risk anything. You win
five hundred from Mundek.

676
00:48:27,717 --> 00:48:30,834
Or you give it to him gladly,
if you get what you want.

677
00:48:30,877 --> 00:48:32,597
- Why are you...?
- I am what?!

678
00:48:32,877 --> 00:48:35,474
And that husband of yours,
what if he did the same?

679
00:48:35,517 --> 00:48:38,303
After all, there's as many
unfaithful as the cheated ones.

680
00:48:38,346 --> 00:48:40,030
There must be a balance
in the end!

681
00:48:40,073 --> 00:48:41,953
Wait on! What husband?

682
00:48:42,197 --> 00:48:43,957
Well, the one here.
Janczewski.

683
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:45,719
The Janczewskis are abroad.

684
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:49,454
Mundek found it for me.
I can live here for a year.

685
00:48:49,917 --> 00:48:51,477
Quite a debt of gratitude.

686
00:48:52,997 --> 00:48:56,557
Supposedly a friendly favour,
and now these tricks...

687
00:48:57,037 --> 00:48:58,597
With those bets.

688
00:49:00,717 --> 00:49:03,117
Then... he calls
very annoyed.

689
00:49:04,637 --> 00:49:06,928
Looks like,
it's not worth his while.

690
00:49:07,157 --> 00:49:08,437
Do you know that...

691
00:49:09,757 --> 00:49:11,317
Do you know that...

692
00:49:11,717 --> 00:49:14,997
...I liked your coming here.

693
00:49:15,837 --> 00:49:20,637
It was nice... A joke...
Just... so simple.

694
00:49:22,797 --> 00:49:25,837
Perhaps... that's how...
it ought to be?

695
00:49:27,677 --> 00:49:30,861
That's not the way you wanted it,
your formula is spoiled!

696
00:49:30,904 --> 00:49:33,714
"It's the balance,
the unfaithful and the cheated!"

697
00:49:33,757 --> 00:49:37,237
If you had a girl you'd be sick
not knowing where she is.

698
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:40,576
Or you'd find a new telephone
number in her notebook.

699
00:49:40,797 --> 00:49:41,837
Right?

700
00:49:42,957 --> 00:49:45,277
Because you... You are...

701
00:49:50,677 --> 00:49:51,797
Wrong number.

702
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:54,274
Let's pay for the whole year.

703
00:49:54,317 --> 00:49:56,264
What if I get run over by a car?

704
00:49:58,677 --> 00:50:02,550
- The course starts in a month?
- Yes, on the first of October.

705
00:50:02,957 --> 00:50:04,357
So, what to do you think?

706
00:50:06,477 --> 00:50:07,997
What language?

707
00:50:08,157 --> 00:50:09,848
Is there a phone book here?

708
00:50:09,917 --> 00:50:11,357
The phone is over there.

709
00:50:12,597 --> 00:50:14,117
So what, shall we enrol?

710
00:50:15,397 --> 00:50:18,101
- The full name and so on.
- There's no book here.

711
00:50:18,144 --> 00:50:20,495
My colleague is using it,
wait a little.

712
00:50:21,157 --> 00:50:22,957
- Have you got a pen?
- No.

713
00:50:24,237 --> 00:50:26,477
I'm sorry...
can I borrow it from you?

714
00:50:26,837 --> 00:50:27,917
Here.

715
00:50:31,877 --> 00:50:34,957
- Wait, I'll go first.
- Go on, write.

716
00:50:36,517 --> 00:50:38,703
May I speak with the director.

717
00:50:39,397 --> 00:50:40,997
Yes, from the Central Board.

718
00:50:41,277 --> 00:50:42,837
Yes, it's about...

719
00:50:43,757 --> 00:50:46,077
...this conference. Exactly.

720
00:50:47,917 --> 00:50:50,477
Hello? Is that the director?

721
00:50:51,317 --> 00:50:55,117
Here's the Central Board.
That's about these...

722
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,327
...hold on,
what was it we wanted?

723
00:50:57,370 --> 00:50:59,850
Mum? It's me.

724
00:51:00,997 --> 00:51:02,830
No need for wanted posters...

725
00:51:03,637 --> 00:51:04,997
Yes, I know.

726
00:51:05,637 --> 00:51:08,077
No changes.
Blond, but not pig-eyed.

727
00:51:08,477 --> 00:51:09,917
I called...

728
00:51:10,637 --> 00:51:13,917
When I was there last time.
Before the holidays, but...

729
00:51:15,157 --> 00:51:16,317
...you were...

730
00:51:17,397 --> 00:51:19,174
at a conference or something.

731
00:51:19,217 --> 00:51:22,604
I always come for a day
and then go back straight away.

732
00:51:24,357 --> 00:51:26,357
Still at the lakes, with fish.

733
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,914
Collecting materials.

734
00:51:27,957 --> 00:51:30,157
How? Not even a post office there!

735
00:51:31,037 --> 00:51:33,397
I have. I earn money, mum!

736
00:51:33,637 --> 00:51:35,837
I don't know what to do with it.

737
00:51:37,037 --> 00:51:40,387
- I've got some in every pocket.
- You wanted the book.

738
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,710
Please, be quick.
My colleague needs it.

739
00:51:44,237 --> 00:51:45,957
What're you looking for?

740
00:51:46,157 --> 00:51:47,277
Kruszyński Rajmund.

741
00:51:51,437 --> 00:51:53,557
No, sure, it won't be long.

742
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:55,597
Rajmund Kruszyński: 21-...

743
00:51:55,757 --> 00:51:56,757
Just the address!

744
00:51:56,997 --> 00:51:58,717
12, Armii Ludowej.

745
00:51:59,077 --> 00:52:00,277
It's just here.

746
00:52:00,597 --> 00:52:02,157
No, I was just talking here.

747
00:52:04,837 --> 00:52:07,877
Well, when I come back,
I'll get myself a room or...

748
00:52:08,317 --> 00:52:10,477
...arrange something
in the attic.

749
00:52:11,197 --> 00:52:13,557
I can rent the attic from...
the caretaker.

750
00:52:15,277 --> 00:52:17,997
I have to...
if I have some girls...

751
00:52:18,197 --> 00:52:19,957
I couldn't do it with you there!

752
00:52:20,397 --> 00:52:21,677
Get married.

753
00:52:22,397 --> 00:52:24,033
Then I may do the same.

754
00:52:25,277 --> 00:52:27,311
Let's have weddings
on the same day.

755
00:52:30,717 --> 00:52:33,919
It's not on for a son,
to do it before his mother!

756
00:52:34,477 --> 00:52:37,237
It's not on for a son,
to do it before his mother!

757
00:52:39,637 --> 00:52:41,117
Are you going to be long?

758
00:52:41,277 --> 00:52:42,997
- Pardon?
- Long?

759
00:52:43,837 --> 00:52:46,677
He... He should be eighteen.

760
00:52:47,717 --> 00:52:50,278
- That stepfather of mine!
- What are you smoking?

761
00:52:50,321 --> 00:52:52,521
- Good ones!
- You might go astray.

762
00:52:52,917 --> 00:52:54,197
You know, how it is.

763
00:52:55,997 --> 00:52:57,557
I'm off to the coast.

764
00:52:57,957 --> 00:53:00,077
- I'll write.
- Terrible!

765
00:53:00,237 --> 00:53:03,906
That's materials from the lakes,
I'll add some from the sea.

766
00:53:04,317 --> 00:53:06,717
Some fish swim to the sea
from the lakes.

767
00:53:07,157 --> 00:53:08,237
Against the stream.

768
00:53:09,317 --> 00:53:11,637
OK! I'll write. Yes.

769
00:53:12,917 --> 00:53:14,637
Remember, you must get married!

770
00:53:15,677 --> 00:53:18,317
You'll find some time...
Yes...

771
00:53:19,077 --> 00:53:20,357
Bye!

772
00:53:20,677 --> 00:53:22,437
- Have you finished?
- Yes.

773
00:53:31,237 --> 00:53:32,517
That's for the call.

774
00:53:32,757 --> 00:53:34,677
Have you got something smaller?

775
00:53:35,637 --> 00:53:38,637
Yes, he's here with me!
Just went out for a while.

776
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:44,277
What languages do you have?

777
00:53:44,437 --> 00:53:47,197
English, French,
Russian, German...

778
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:48,997
- Spanish?
- Yes.

779
00:53:49,157 --> 00:53:51,234
And Italian.
We may also have Czech.

780
00:53:51,277 --> 00:53:52,557
I'll take Spanish.

781
00:53:52,952 --> 00:53:55,354
I'm telling you,
I'm not so sure about him.

782
00:53:55,397 --> 00:53:56,757
Fill it in, please.

783
00:53:57,677 --> 00:54:00,757
Are you paying for a year?
A month? A semester?

784
00:54:00,917 --> 00:54:01,957
How much is it?

785
00:54:02,117 --> 00:54:03,957
70 zloties for a month.

786
00:54:04,117 --> 00:54:06,517
- Semester...
- No, just a month.

787
00:54:06,677 --> 00:54:07,797
All right.

788
00:54:08,397 --> 00:54:10,517
I gave you 20, here's... 50.

789
00:54:10,917 --> 00:54:12,037
Yes...

790
00:54:13,117 --> 00:54:14,837
- Shall I sign here?
- Yes.

791
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,888
Do you know
what kind of guy is he?

792
00:54:18,117 --> 00:54:20,117
- All right.
- Is that all? - Yes.

793
00:54:20,277 --> 00:54:22,077
Thank you.

794
00:54:25,677 --> 00:54:29,357
Guys, put a jar to the wall,
you'll hear better!

795
00:54:31,077 --> 00:54:33,717
What is she saying,
what is she saying now?

796
00:54:38,437 --> 00:54:41,974
Let's put the fish in the bathtub,
we'll hear better through the...

797
00:54:42,017 --> 00:54:43,057
Mundek.

798
00:54:46,397 --> 00:54:47,837
Take you glasses off.

799
00:54:51,517 --> 00:54:54,597
Leave him, he'll faint with fear.

800
00:55:02,277 --> 00:55:03,917
You owe me something!

801
00:55:04,957 --> 00:55:06,557
At least a hundred!

802
00:55:08,837 --> 00:55:10,837
That did it.

803
00:55:17,437 --> 00:55:20,757
- Who's this guy?
- An ichthyologist.

804
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:22,397
Trades in fish.

805
00:55:22,597 --> 00:55:25,757
This... ichthyology
is to do with fish?

806
00:55:25,917 --> 00:55:27,317
Little fish...

807
00:55:28,397 --> 00:55:30,157
Maybe some warm water?

808
00:55:30,215 --> 00:55:33,231
- We could warm some.
- Cold is better for bleeding!

809
00:55:33,274 --> 00:55:35,874
We've a heater and fish...

810
00:55:36,214 --> 00:55:39,734
We could apply
an ichthyologic torture.

811
00:55:39,877 --> 00:55:42,317
Look, he's not worried!

812
00:55:42,477 --> 00:55:44,917
He's occupied with himself.
The egoist.

813
00:55:45,157 --> 00:55:47,837
Don't worry man,
the plug is broken.

814
00:55:47,997 --> 00:55:50,397
We should mend it,
it might be useful.

815
00:55:50,557 --> 00:55:53,077
You'll pay me back,
when you can.

816
00:55:53,837 --> 00:55:55,397
When you're a director.

817
00:56:01,053 --> 00:56:03,956
- Do you want to land on the Moon?
- I'm just going to the shop.

818
00:56:03,999 --> 00:56:06,119
- Do you want to be a cosmonaut?
- What for?

819
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:08,954
- That's for TV?
- Radio! - Well, we have a TV.

820
00:56:08,997 --> 00:56:11,717
What about you?
Can you introduce yourself?

821
00:56:11,877 --> 00:56:14,957
No? Maybe you?
Would you like to be a cosmonaut?

822
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,857
Just like that? Maybe my daughter,
she's doing a dressmaking course.

823
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,437
By all means!
Great!

824
00:56:20,597 --> 00:56:22,997
Sir! Would you like to
introduce yourself?

825
00:56:23,157 --> 00:56:25,157
My name is An...

826
00:56:27,397 --> 00:56:30,197
Antoni... See, I...

827
00:56:30,357 --> 00:56:31,997
Don't be nervous.

828
00:56:32,157 --> 00:56:33,557
Jasiński.

829
00:56:33,717 --> 00:56:35,637
Excellent.
And now a question:

830
00:56:35,797 --> 00:56:37,677
Would you like to be
an astronaut?

831
00:56:37,837 --> 00:56:38,837
Yes.

832
00:56:39,117 --> 00:56:41,702
I'd like for something
irreversible to happen.

833
00:56:41,745 --> 00:56:44,068
So that you couldn't
go back on it.

834
00:56:44,837 --> 00:56:47,597
But that you could still... decide.

835
00:56:47,797 --> 00:56:48,797
After the launch.

836
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:51,693
To choose the direction, speed,
the way to destination.

837
00:56:51,754 --> 00:56:52,797
That would be it.

838
00:56:52,997 --> 00:56:55,314
It doesn't have to be
the Moon, because...

839
00:56:55,357 --> 00:56:56,997
If I were a driver...

840
00:56:57,157 --> 00:56:59,557
of, say... a lorry.

841
00:56:59,717 --> 00:57:01,957
I'd drive... long distance...,

842
00:57:02,117 --> 00:57:04,757
To Jelenia Góra, to Rzeszów.

843
00:57:05,197 --> 00:57:09,023
- ...Kołobrzeg... Shall I go on?
- Maybe's enough? - Go on, please.

844
00:57:09,117 --> 00:57:12,557
I'd drive for several hours,
stop over, whenever I like.

845
00:57:12,917 --> 00:57:16,957
But there's a task, one has to
be on time. Then...

846
00:57:17,477 --> 00:57:19,797
on a day off
I'd walk in a strange city...

847
00:57:19,997 --> 00:57:22,557
Behind every street corner
there's something...

848
00:57:22,837 --> 00:57:25,597
You don't know this city,
you explore it.

849
00:57:25,957 --> 00:57:27,797
It doesn't have to be the Moon.

850
00:57:28,277 --> 00:57:31,473
Then you come back.
Or go on a different route...

851
00:57:32,375 --> 00:57:35,474
The main thing is to be able
to give something from oneself.

852
00:57:35,517 --> 00:57:38,601
Sometimes, conditions are hard.
One has to risk it.

853
00:57:38,644 --> 00:57:40,324
That's the main thing.

854
00:57:40,437 --> 00:57:42,277
Excellent, you put it very well.

855
00:57:42,437 --> 00:57:44,277
Actually, why aren't
you a driver?

856
00:57:44,437 --> 00:57:47,877
I don't know.
Maybe because I can't drive.

857
00:57:48,037 --> 00:57:49,717
You could learn!

858
00:57:50,385 --> 00:57:54,637
Yes, if I were called up,
I could've learnt.

859
00:57:54,797 --> 00:57:57,517
They have various courses.
Driving as well.

860
00:57:58,157 --> 00:57:59,157
But it's too late.

861
00:57:59,317 --> 00:58:01,637
It's always worthwhile
to start anew.

862
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,794
- How old are you?
- What's the time?

863
00:58:03,837 --> 00:58:05,437
2:30.
How old are you? 24?

864
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,194
It's too late, I won't manage.

865
00:58:07,237 --> 00:58:09,397
It's always worthwhile
to start anew.

866
00:58:09,557 --> 00:58:11,357
That would be an excellent end.

867
00:58:11,385 --> 00:58:15,117
That was a rehearsal. So, maybe
we record it now, all right?

868
00:58:15,317 --> 00:58:16,317
No, not now!

869
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:45,997
<i>The music is swelling
to explode in a dramatic finale!</i>

870
00:58:46,157 --> 00:58:50,157
<i>But before that it comes
to allegro con fuoco,</i>

871
00:58:50,317 --> 00:58:53,157
<i>we hear the end
of the soothing...</i>

872
00:58:59,317 --> 00:59:00,677
The door's open!

873
00:59:03,477 --> 00:59:07,157
- What is it?
- Have you any empty bottles?

874
00:59:07,797 --> 00:59:10,877
Maybe something...
O! Here we are.

875
00:59:13,557 --> 00:59:14,797
And this one...

876
00:59:16,357 --> 00:59:17,717
Take it!

877
00:59:18,717 --> 00:59:21,117
Cauliflowers for lunch!

878
00:59:21,757 --> 00:59:23,717
I'll sit down for a while.

879
00:59:28,757 --> 00:59:30,517
Now you've got it nice.

880
00:59:30,917 --> 00:59:33,077
At your age
I was in the Uprising.

881
00:59:33,357 --> 00:59:36,517
You were just a nipper in 1944.

882
00:59:37,277 --> 00:59:39,747
I'd been hit
by a shrapnel in my leg

883
00:59:39,797 --> 00:59:41,477
so I was no longer in actions.

884
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:44,671
But I was still killing the Krauts.
The caught ones.

885
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:47,594
Couldn't waste bullets,
so I used unexploded shells.

886
00:59:47,637 --> 00:59:50,374
Sometimes they would explode
after the third go,

887
00:59:50,436 --> 00:59:51,963
or wouldn't explode at all.

888
00:59:53,437 --> 00:59:55,797
A Kraut dug himself a pit.

889
00:59:56,517 --> 00:59:58,637
Lied in it nicely.

890
00:59:58,797 --> 01:00:00,957
And I aimed
between his eyes: bang!

891
01:00:01,117 --> 01:00:03,037
And nothing.
The Kraut screamed.

892
01:00:03,197 --> 01:00:05,117
I hit again and again...

893
01:00:05,997 --> 01:00:07,997
until I succeeded.

894
01:00:08,557 --> 01:00:10,597
Those were the times...

895
01:00:16,157 --> 01:00:18,397
You've got a dog.
Out for a walk?

896
01:00:18,557 --> 01:00:19,557
Yes.

897
01:00:19,717 --> 01:00:22,357
- You're going away?
- I intended to.

898
01:00:22,517 --> 01:00:24,597
I had my share of travelling
as well.

899
01:00:24,837 --> 01:00:27,614
After the war I drove a lorry
all over Poland.

900
01:00:27,657 --> 01:00:29,797
When there was a need
I took corpses.

901
01:00:30,557 --> 01:00:33,917
You know, money was scarce.

902
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:37,517
Not everybody could afford to
transport a corpse by railway.

903
01:00:37,542 --> 01:00:38,877
In a coffin.

904
01:00:40,037 --> 01:00:42,797
So I'd put the corpse with me
in the cab...,

905
01:00:42,957 --> 01:00:45,637
pull his hat over the eyes
and go!

906
01:00:46,237 --> 01:00:48,390
If I got stopped
by a police patrol,

907
01:00:48,433 --> 01:00:49,673
I'd say: shush!

908
01:00:50,357 --> 01:00:51,357
Don't wake him up,

909
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,997
he's tired after a conference.
Let him sleep.

910
01:00:54,397 --> 01:00:55,837
And drive off.

911
01:00:57,157 --> 01:01:01,429
How could you drive,
with... this leg?

912
01:01:01,717 --> 01:01:04,117
Well... you know...

913
01:01:04,517 --> 01:01:09,085
It was... with this leg,
it happened before the war.

914
01:01:09,677 --> 01:01:11,437
Lost it under a tramcar...

915
01:01:13,197 --> 01:01:16,317
But it's nicer to talk...
about the Uprising...

916
01:01:16,477 --> 01:01:18,757
...and the truck, right?

917
01:01:19,437 --> 01:01:20,557
Hey!

918
01:01:22,917 --> 01:01:24,157
The bottles!

919
01:02:08,197 --> 01:02:10,637
<i>That concerns you!</i>

920
01:02:11,997 --> 01:02:16,997
<i>"A man at the station who says
I don't know why I came here,</i>

921
01:02:18,557 --> 01:02:20,517
<i>and after many years...</i>

922
01:02:20,877 --> 01:02:23,557
<i>or after something like youth...</i>

923
01:02:24,237 --> 01:02:25,837
<i>or love...</i>

924
01:02:26,517 --> 01:02:30,285
<i>with his hand at the neck he wants
to put everything straight</i>

925
01:02:30,517 --> 01:02:32,117
<i>and straightens his tie."</i>

926
01:02:32,277 --> 01:02:34,557
<i>The poet already knew,
that the best ties,</i>

927
01:02:34,717 --> 01:02:38,197
<i>are the "Forward" made ties!</i>

928
01:03:03,357 --> 01:03:04,677
Who are these people?

929
01:03:05,477 --> 01:03:08,037
These names?
Who's Roman W.?!

930
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:11,597
I don't know them!
What's this cross?

931
01:03:18,117 --> 01:03:20,797
What did you spent money on?
You're paid today!

932
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,200
Is that all?
Where's the rest?

933
01:03:24,517 --> 01:03:29,797
I have holes on the elbows
and the wardrobe's full of these!

934
01:03:30,237 --> 01:03:31,397
Not enough?!

935
01:03:31,917 --> 01:03:33,077
Not enough?!

936
01:03:33,277 --> 01:03:34,597
Still not enough?!

937
01:03:35,397 --> 01:03:36,797
And in the pockets...

938
01:03:41,197 --> 01:03:42,957
Whose phone number is this?

939
01:03:44,197 --> 01:03:46,037
My things take up...

940
01:03:54,077 --> 01:03:57,277
My pay?
I paid the caretaker.

941
01:03:57,597 --> 01:03:59,757
We owed for the rent.

942
01:03:59,917 --> 01:04:01,157
Where have you been?

943
01:04:04,397 --> 01:04:08,277
There're things which ought to be
discussed calmly and reasonably.

944
01:04:08,437 --> 01:04:10,477
Not like now, not in this way!

945
01:04:10,637 --> 01:04:13,477
What things?!
Being unfaithful, yes?!

946
01:04:14,277 --> 01:04:17,837
It could be being unfaithful.
But also an illness, for example.

947
01:04:17,997 --> 01:04:19,957
Or a child to be born.

948
01:04:20,157 --> 01:04:21,477
Where have you been?

949
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:26,757
Listen. I'm staying with you
for as long as I want.

950
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:29,677
I can afford to be honest.

951
01:04:30,317 --> 01:04:32,869
I wouldn't come back home,
do you understand?

952
01:04:32,912 --> 01:04:34,992
If you can still call this a home.

953
01:04:37,917 --> 01:04:40,114
Has my colleague
checked it already?

954
01:04:40,157 --> 01:04:41,917
- No!
- Go away!

955
01:04:43,837 --> 01:04:46,477
I'd like to know
where've you been.

956
01:04:46,677 --> 01:04:50,077
60, Pretty Street, flat 21.
Didn't you see me?

957
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:53,619
An hour ago you nearly brushed
against me at Pretty Street.

958
01:04:53,837 --> 01:04:55,717
Why have you packed
these things?

959
01:04:57,517 --> 01:04:58,917
No reason.

960
01:05:07,197 --> 01:05:08,437
Pull a face.

961
01:05:08,837 --> 01:05:11,317
- What?
- Pull a face.

962
01:05:11,997 --> 01:05:14,917
<i>- Here's Warsaw Radio. It's 3 pm.</i>
- The ugliest one.

963
01:05:15,357 --> 01:05:17,957
- Or the funniest one.
<i>- Here are the news.</i>

964
01:05:18,797 --> 01:05:19,997
Or any kind of face.

965
01:05:20,157 --> 01:05:22,437
<i>Today is the beginning
of the school year.</i>

966
01:05:22,597 --> 01:05:24,117
Once upon a time...

967
01:05:24,992 --> 01:05:27,674
- ...you could do it.
- <i>...started their lessons.</i>

968
01:05:27,717 --> 01:05:29,677
At the beginning it's always...

969
01:05:30,037 --> 01:05:33,597
<i>...a speech to teachers and youth
gathered by radio speakers...</i>

970
01:05:34,477 --> 01:05:35,877
...this...

971
01:05:36,797 --> 01:05:38,797
What's a reason for this fight?

972
01:05:42,477 --> 01:05:43,757
I don't know.

973
01:05:45,037 --> 01:05:48,061
<i>On the occasion of the outbreak
of the Second World War.</i>

974
01:05:48,104 --> 01:05:51,194
In those two years
I didn't find out anything.

975
01:05:51,237 --> 01:05:53,237
<i>The memory of tragic events...</i>

976
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:54,670
I want to know about you...

977
01:05:54,695 --> 01:05:59,055
How much time have you
got for that? A year? 5 minutes?

978
01:06:01,077 --> 01:06:02,237
No.

979
01:06:03,157 --> 01:06:06,757
- At least I would like...
- 60, Pretty Street, fifth floor.

980
01:06:07,379 --> 01:06:09,997
<i>...the present state of armament
is sufficient,</i>

981
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:13,154
<i>to kill each inhabitant of the
Earth a few or several times.</i>

982
01:06:13,197 --> 01:06:14,717
I've sold the dog.

983
01:06:14,957 --> 01:06:17,208
<i>The scientists
analysing these numbers</i>

984
01:06:17,251 --> 01:06:20,171
<i>for the subject of their research
adopted the name...</i>

985
01:07:03,117 --> 01:07:06,637
<i>The stairs are dirty constantly
and you're fighting?!</i>

986
01:07:39,077 --> 01:07:42,877
<i>5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 490!</i>

987
01:07:43,037 --> 01:07:48,277
<i>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...</i>

988
01:07:48,437 --> 01:07:50,597
Wow! It would be 500!

989
01:07:52,557 --> 01:07:53,797
Sorry.

990
01:07:56,197 --> 01:08:02,717
<i>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</i>

991
01:08:02,877 --> 01:08:05,037
Look, a sportsman.
You see him?

992
01:08:05,197 --> 01:08:06,557
A sportsman.

993
01:08:09,477 --> 01:08:10,477
Here.

994
01:08:10,637 --> 01:08:14,037
He'll be jumping until
the tram shortens him by half.

995
01:08:14,197 --> 01:08:16,237
Will he make it?
No, he won't.

996
01:08:16,477 --> 01:08:17,757
He made it!

997
01:08:19,877 --> 01:08:23,037
If I pay a normal fare, he should
pay an abnormal one.

998
01:08:23,197 --> 01:08:24,997
I'm getting off just here.

999
01:08:39,677 --> 01:08:41,397
A sportsman. Did you see him?

1000
01:08:46,477 --> 01:08:47,797
Here!

1001
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:49,237
And here!

1002
01:08:49,397 --> 01:08:52,597
Two!
That was lucky!

1003
01:08:53,357 --> 01:08:54,797
How much could it be?

1004
01:08:54,957 --> 01:08:58,157
Well, it will be
in the region of...

1005
01:08:58,677 --> 01:08:59,757
You'll get money!

1006
01:08:59,917 --> 01:09:02,917
- Sorry, I'm late, I couldn't...
- Get in!

1007
01:09:03,557 --> 01:09:05,565
Have you got any cigarettes?

1008
01:09:07,797 --> 01:09:10,397
Guys,
who wants something to eat?

1009
01:09:10,997 --> 01:09:15,597
<i>Eurydice, don't wait for me,</i>

1010
01:09:15,757 --> 01:09:17,997
<i>I'm forgetting you slowly.</i>

1011
01:09:18,157 --> 01:09:20,277
Don't get in! Reserved!

1012
01:09:20,437 --> 01:09:23,157
For children
of the unknown soldier!

1013
01:09:23,317 --> 01:09:25,397
<i>Eurydice, Life is breaking us,</i>

1014
01:09:25,557 --> 01:09:30,157
<i>and you can never start anew.</i>

1015
01:09:35,877 --> 01:09:42,077
<i>I don't even want to know
if you died.</i>

1016
01:09:43,477 --> 01:09:46,157

1020
01:09:56,117 --> 01:09:58,997
<i>Eurydice, where will I find you?</i>

1021
01:09:59,157 --> 01:10:02,397
<i>The sorrow pushes the heart
into the throat.</i>

<i>and you can never start a new.</i>

1028
01:10:26,717 --> 01:10:31,677
<i>Eurydice, where will I find you?</i>

1029
01:10:31,837 --> 01:10:37,197
<i>The sorrow pushes my heart

1030

<i>I don't even want to know
