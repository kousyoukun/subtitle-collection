1
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,931
[Ariana] I take it right when I wake up.

2
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,309
I keep it next to my toothbrush
so I remember to take it.

3
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:21,396
Takes about 40 minutes to kick in
and you can feel it.

4
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,231
I start to sweat.

5
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,400
My heart accelerates very rapidly.

6
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:26,443
[clapping sound]

7
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,405
[Blue] The fives get you through the day
a little faster.

8
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:33,074
But if it's Monday,
sometimes you take ten.

9
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,122
[Matthew] From there,
this wave of happiness

10
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,583
hit me that was like a warm glow.

11
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:44,627
[Delaney] Suddenly, I could pay attention
and my handwriting got neater.

12
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:45,712
I thought that was so cool.

13
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:48,757
[Eben] My mind came alive,
my body felt alive.

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,968
When it works, it works like a bang.

15
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,391
[man] Suddenly, you are in a room
with 10,000 doors

16
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:03,063
and behind a bunch of the doors
is some cool stuff.

17
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:06,274
You are gonna wanna try and run
as fast as possible

18
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:10,528
and stay awake as long as possible,
to look in all the doors.

19
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:14,199
[interviewer] What did Adderall do for you
when you were playing the game?

20
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:17,619
[Jasper] Laser-like focus,
reaction time increased, alert.

21
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:20,747
[Leigh] The first week I took it,
I was like, "I like this. This is good."

22
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,664
[Nathanael] Adderall. Warning,

23
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,500
side effects may include
being awesome at everything.

24
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,502
[Blue] It's like
the New York Stock Exchange ticker.

25
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,295
That's what my mind looks like
all the time.

26
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:30,673
When I take Adderall,
it's like the ticker slows down.

27
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,887
[Jasper] I can zone in on something
and completely ignore everything.

28
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,015
[Peter] Every investment banker
hears about the heyday of cocaine

29
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:42,435
and doing it off their desks
and doing it off strippers,

30
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,897
and that's not how it is with Adderall.

31
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,526
-Who takes Adderall anymore?
-[Carver] Half the kids in Palo Alto.

32
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,903
-[Ariana] You name it, I've tried it.
-[Regina] Adderall.

33
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,405
[Ariana] Ritalin, Concerta, Adderall,
Vyvanse, Focalin.

34
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,573
[Brigid Polk] Amphetamine...

35
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:59,077
[Fadiman] The idea that children
were given amphetamine in the '60s

36
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,662
would have appalled everyone.

37
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:04,124
From now on, it's nothing but fresh air,
lots of hugs

38
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,042
and good old-fashioned Ritalin.

39
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:11,297
[Delaney] I am Adderall.
I'm never not on it.

40
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,968
I would never think of something as me
not being on Adderall.

41
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,147
[techno music playing]

42
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,614
This is the most ridiculous bathroom
in the entire world.

43
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,075
Everyone has their own starter pack.

44
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,704
It's like a little telling of y'all are.

45
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,372
"Free the nipple."

46
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:47,375
Jews 'cause I'm Jewish.

47
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,169
"New Jersey" 'cause I tell people
I'm from New York, but I'm not.

48
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:53,006
I'm from New Jersey.
So that's a running joke.

49
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:57,385
And a Jew smoking weed through a menorah.

50
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,846
This is my favorite thing in here.

51
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,726
Every time we go out,
we take something home with us.

52
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:08,938
So, my parents,
right before I left to school, were like,

53
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,607
"We need to get you a lockbox."

54
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,858
And I was like, "Why?"

55
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,068
They were like, "For your pills."

56
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:17,488
I was like, "What do you mean, a lockbox?
Who's gonna take my pills?"

57
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,740
It's Rx gold.

58
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,910
People will take it from you
if they know you have it.

59
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:25,622
I don't think I know anyone
that is prescribed it

60
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,206
that doesn't sell a little on the side.

61
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,834
That's a big thing here
'cause it's a hard school,

62
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,879
so a lot of people are on Adderall.

63
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,797
Why would anyone
wanna put this in their body?

64
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:35,715
[Ariana] This is trazodone.

65
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,760
This is Ativan, for my panic attacks.

66
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,678
Then when I got here, I was like,

67
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:45,266
"Holy shit. Everybody takes Adderall.
Everyone."

68
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,561
[Jasper] That's an empty one.

69
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:53,274
[Leigh] I've openly seen people in classes
take out their bottle

70
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,485
and hand off pills
to someone next to them.

71
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,112
"Anyone have Addie I could buy?
Please. Please."

72
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,573
[chuckling]

73
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,576
Sometimes I forget that it's illegal.

74
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,038
There's a public Facebook group,
like a classifieds,

75
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,331
buying and selling anything.

76
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:13,378
And people will post in there
that they're selling 20 XR Adderall,

77
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:17,257
and not think that they are drug dealing
in a public forum.

78
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:26,057
My mom didn't hide it, but I hide it.

79
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:32,146
Adderall and Instagram are hand in hand
in being the perfect student.

80
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,524
[Delaney] You wanna be beautiful
and skinny,

81
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,276
and you wanna have amazing grades,

82
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:41,698
and then you also wanna be able to go out,
and Adderall just sews it all up for you.

83
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,785
You've got instant release versus
extended release.

84
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:50,456
People will take it and sit down
at the little cubicles in the library.

85
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,749
They lay out everything,

86
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,585
that way you can't be distracted
by anything else.

87
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,379
And you have a set playlist,

88
00:04:56,462 --> 00:05:00,341
and people will put in their ear buds,
and you're ready to roll.

89
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:09,100
[Brown] At the simplest level,
the norms that I would say

90
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:12,145
are driving use
of performance enhancing drugs

91
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:18,276
are those that simply tell us,
"Your task is to concentrate,

92
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:23,239
to perform at the highest capacity
that you possibly can,

93
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,867
and to do it for as long as it takes."

94
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:30,580
Whether it's at an investment bank,
or whether it's a homework assignment,

95
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:34,292
the question is,
"How can you come out on top?"

96
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,423
[Leigh] Obviously, if you're presented
with something

97
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,925
that will maximize the good things
in your life,

98
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,677
you'll get everything you can out of it.

99
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:45,970
Of course you're gonna want it.

100
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,432
I was talking to someone about this
and they're like,

101
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:53,394
"Isn't it the same thing
as having a good breakfast before an exam

102
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,021
and drinking a cup of coffee?

103
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:59,567
Why is medication the thing
that's so immoral or unethical

104
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,361
about getting an edge over everyone else?"

105
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:06,324
Let's see. I'm taking five classes.

106
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:10,912
So if I get a 90 on the paper,
an 82 on the exam today,

107
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,039
I'll get an 89.77.

108
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:16,334
So that's not gonna fly,
unless she rounds up.

109
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,086
So, let's say an 83,

110
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,545
but it's also a pride thing.

111
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:23,132
I'd like to finish strong,
stronger than I started.

112
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:27,720
Adderall, for me, has always been
like when you're desperate and hopeless,

113
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,430
and you're like, "I need this right now

114
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:33,434
because I need to be my best,
smartest, fastest self."

115
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,153
[Brown] The problem today
isn't that jobs are scarcer,

116
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,448
or that positions in schools are fewer.

117
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:53,913
It's that we live
in a hypercompetitive order,

118
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:58,376
where the competition
is not just for arriving,

119
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,211
but the competition is never-ending.

120
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:07,510
Every human being is now required
to understand themselves

121
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,471
as a little bit of human capital.

122
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,224
Parents are terribly concerned,

123
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:16,185
from before the moment
that their children are born,

124
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:21,774
about what that human capital value
will be in their child,

125
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:25,361
and are tending it with everything
from Mozart in the womb

126
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:31,325
to positions in preschools
and access to certain kinds of sports

127
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,744
and certain kinds of curriculums.

128
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:39,167
The anxiety about the human capital value

129
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,086
that their children are able to develop

130
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:46,424
leads, I think,
almost inexorably toward Adderall,

131
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:52,138
either offered by the parents
or offered to peers by one another

132
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,515
once they hit high school and college.

133
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,768
I sometimes joke about how
when I was in college,

134
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,854
people did drugs to check out.

135
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,523
And now people do drugs to check in.

136
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:06,277
And that says something
about our culture right now.

137
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,864
[interviewer] What do you think it says?
It makes me kind of depressed.

138
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,282
[laughing]

139
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,493
We probably have meds for that.

140
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,621
I had tons of friends in high school
that were on Adderall,

141
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:19,665
and because they were on Adderall
or Vyvanse or something like that,

142
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,376
were getting two and a half time
on the SATs or something,

143
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,837
and got to take it alone. And I wanted it.

144
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:29,759
I had three straight days
with this psychiatrist.

145
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,305
I remember the testing
was so stressful for me

146
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,474
'cause it's made to make you feel dumb

147
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:40,269
and feel like you can't complete
these tasks that other people can.

148
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,439
That was the first time I was like,
"I might really need this."

149
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:51,489
ADD is a condition where people have more
trouble focusing with their attention.

150
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,616
People typically are distractible.

151
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,911
Because there aren't clear-cut boundaries,

152
00:08:56,994 --> 00:09:01,165
it becomes fuzzy of what do you treat
and what do you not treat.

153
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,763
[Leigh] I got diagnosed
by the psychiatrist,

154
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:19,642
and I was thrilled
because I had the SAT in a couple months.

155
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,018
I had never tried it,

156
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,729
but the first week that I took it,
I was like,

157
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,023
"I like this. This is good."

158
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:30,403
I remember I was concerned about
not feeling entirely myself,

159
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,281
too zoned and I didn't feel
as funny as usual.

160
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,282
I remember saying that.

161
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:37,618
But you had to pick and choose,

162
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:41,831
and I wanted to pick getting good grades
and doing well on the SAT.

163
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,792
[Schwarz] The desire to do better
is pretty universal.

164
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,252
People like succeeding.

165
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:49,380
People like not letting others down.

166
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:53,634
So, what you've seen is that
every generation has found a different way

167
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,261
to try to enhance their performance.

168
00:09:55,344 --> 00:10:00,433
Now in this case, a lot of the time,
it has been what we now call ADHD drugs.

169

[newscaster] In the high pressure
rat race of academic achievement,

The first article about college abuse
of amphetamine to study

181
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,597
was in Time magazine in 1937.

182

This ain't new.

183
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,978
[Rasmussen] In the early days,
they called it the pep-pill.

184
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,355
Pep is what Americans want.

185
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:51,984
It's about drive, ambition,
being productive and hardworking,

186
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,612
and making the sale,
and getting the job done.

[man] Kellogg's Pep sure is
a treat to eat.

188
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,827
[Rasmussen] So, Dr. Gordon Alles
was a young biochemist

189
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,954
trying to create an allergy medicine.

190
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,998
And that's how, in 1929,

191
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:09,794
he happened to synthesize the drug
we now call amphetamine.

192
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:13,422
He injected himself
with 50 milligrams of the salt,

193
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,924
which is quite a high dose.

194
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,303
And his lab notes
are absolutely fascinating.

195
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:23,474
Within minutes, he's like,
"Strong feeling of well-being."

196
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,726
He's like, "I really like this!"

197
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,436
[Rasmussen] After about an hour,
Alles noted,

198
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,149
"Feeling of well-being, palpitation,
rather sleepless night,

199
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,985
mind seemed to race
from one subject to another."

200
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,947
This is the record
of the first amphetamine experience,

201
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,408
Alles' self-experiment in June, 1929.

202
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,583
It's very clear that from the beginning,
this amphetamine product was a compound,

203
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,336
a chemical that needed a medical use.

204
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,425
[Schwarz] It didn't take long
for amphetamine

205
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,427
to become a prescription medication.

206
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:03,848
In the mid-1930s, Smith Kline &amp; French
introduced it as Benzedrine.

207
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:07,518
And you would snort it
and it would clear your sinuses.

208
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:11,230
The problem is, amphetamine feels
really good to a lot of people,

209
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:14,066
and it gets them jazzed
and ready to perform.

219
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:50,311
military doctors in Germany
tried it on some military cadets.

220
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,438
Of course, the students liked it.

221
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:56,066
The British found these pills
in downed German planes.

222
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,693
They seemed to be acting like supermen,

223

that were making them supermen.

225
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:05,743
when they saw that the British were
approving the drug and introducing it,

226
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:09,038
they hurried along the studies
and took it on, too.

should have a hot lunch.

00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,588
Very well. Just scramble me
a couple of Benzedrine tablets.

231
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,465
[Rasmussen] Benzedrine took off
after the war

232
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,926
as a general practice antidepressant.

233
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,177
So did Dexedrine.

234
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,140
Among its uses was weight control.

235
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:35,523
Also, painful menstruation,
what we'd call PMD, was tested.

236
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,649
This is a funny trial.

237
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,901
The doctor who was running it
was working at a factory

238
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,903
where all the assembly line workers
were women.

239
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,614
The subjects were requesting more of it,

240
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:44,990
but it turned out that the demand

241
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,368
had nothing to do
with their actual menstrual cycle.

242
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,911
They just liked taking the drugs.

243
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,412

[man] One, two...

245
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:01,298
[Rasmussen] Amphetamine inhalers became
a kind of a staple in jazz culture,

246
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,134
particularly in the bebop circles.

247
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:07,513
Charlie Parker was certainly
a regular user.

248
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,766
Some of the people
that are later remembered

249
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,352
as the important beat writers,
like Jack Kerouac,

250
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,312
were going to these jazz clubs.

251
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,733
Kerouac really admired
the way bebop sounded

252
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,319
and he wanted to model his own writing

253
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:27,241
after this very spontaneous,
free rush of sound.

254
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:32,997

Go moan for man. Go moan, go groan."

[Rasmussen] When he discovered
the amphetamine inhaler,

256
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:39,461
he really took to it and used it
as an aid for his writing for a long time.

257
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,632
It was normal to have amphetamine
when you wanted it.

258
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,925
Most people probably just got it

259
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:48,220
by asking for a prescription
from their family practitioner.

Max Jacobson, who's known as Dr. Feelgood
by many of his patients,

264
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,483
was one of these speed doctors.

Somebody leans out of the car window
and goes, "Fuck you, techie."

304
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,609
Only in the Bay Area would that happen.

305
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:49,777
It was weird 'cause they just assumed

306
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,738
since I was on an electric unicycle
that I must be in tech.

307
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:59,244
There is an archetype in tech
of a person who,

308
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,330
in most cases, doesn't exist,

309
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:07,503
and he works 16 hours a day, every day,
and the code just comes out of him.

310
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:12,299
And just flawlessly from start to finish,
it's just Mozart on the screen.

311
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:16,553
And everybody wants to be that person.

312
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:21,183
I did, and I'm sure
some part of me still does.

313
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:25,896
We all want to be awesome
at the things that we're trying to do.

314
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,524
And then you throw Adderall into the mix,

315
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:33,362
and that lets you be the person
that's there till midnight or 1:00.

316
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,323
[Eben] Let's go!

317
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:42,204
You guys know the drill.
Give me a good base, a good knee bend.

318
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,415
Pull that belly button to your spine,
tighten that core up.

319
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,960
The thing with football is
you have to love it.

320
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:53,632
It's way too hard on your body,
and your mind, really.

321
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,926
Go! Keep pushing it.

322
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,011
[announcer 1] Eben Britton, right here,
a lot people are saying

323
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,597
that may be the best offensive tackle
in the country.

324
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:04,017
[announcer 2] Arizona
has won their home opener.

325
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,936
[Eben] There's nothing
that can describe that.

326
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:09,565
That was the biggest win
we've had in a long time.

327
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,276
You don't make it
to Division I football, period,

328
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:16,196
if you can't push yourself
to superhuman feats.

329
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,781
And then to make it to the NFL,

330
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:22,161
that's like a 0.1% of every kid
that's ever picked up a football.

331
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,914
[Eben] I don't know
if there's a way to get to perfect,

332
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,709
but that's what you're always looking for.

333
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:38,051
[Brit] I miss the rookie season.
That was the drama-free, happy season.

334
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,428
[Eben] Yeah.

335
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:43,390
Man, I was kicking ass.
I'm healthy, I'm strong, I'm quick.

336
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:46,435
I'm just building on the success
that I had in my rookie year.

337
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:50,230
And we're in a workout,
and we're doing squats,

338
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:53,817
and I went down,
and I just feel this squirting.

339
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,904
It's like a tube of toothpaste,
somebody just went like...

340
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:02,159
We started doing tests, and it's like,
"Shit, it's a herniated disc. Clearly."

341
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:05,412
Come on, don't step on those.

342
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,873
I come back to training camp
and the coaches were like,

343
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:11,168
"Dude, what the fuck happened to you?"

344
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:16,632
It doesn't matter if you're hurt or not.
Every guy is hurt.

345
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,760
It's, "Can you get out there and play?"

346
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:24,056
Because there's always somebody
coming behind you to take your job.

347
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,351
This Monday night game,

348
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:33,357
I was at this breaking point
of exhaustion and frustration,

349
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:37,402
and one of our teammates was like,
"I got Adderall."

350
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:42,366
I took them,
and I just felt jolted back to life.

351
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:45,244
I felt this surge of energy
rush through me.

352
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,455
My mind came alive. My body felt alive.

353
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:52,042
I felt like I was able
to get a jump on the snap count,

354
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,462
and I was able to react faster
than guys were,

355
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,422
and I could see things
that were happening,

356
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,258
like, corners blitzing...

357
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:05,389
A stimulant is a drug
that stimulates people.

358
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:08,517
It makes you feel more up
and awake and alert.

359
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,519
And they also increase euphoria.

360
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:14,398
All of those things are very positive.

361
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,733
That's why people have their caffeine
in the morning.

362
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:20,404
[Diller] So there's two main groups
of stimulants.

363
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:24,032
There's amphetamine and methylphenidate.

364
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:29,454
Methylphenidate is the major constituent
of Ritalin and Concerta,

365
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,791
two drugs that are very, very widely used.

366
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:37,337
And amphetamine
is the major constituent of Adderall.

367
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:41,758
This whole class of medications
that we think of stimulants

368
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,428
work on the catecholamine system
in the brain.

369
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:47,723
And there are two parts
of the catecholamine system.

370
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:52,269
One is called norepinephrine,
or colloquially sometimes

371
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:55,188
people think about that
as noradrenaline or adrenaline.

372
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,107
And the other is dopamine.

373
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,610
And what these drugs
typically do in the brain is,

374
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:05,490
they either enhance
the release of catecholamines

375
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,035
or they block its reuptake.

376
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,370
[Hinshaw] They increase reaction time,

377
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,123
they probably increase
some tolerance to pain

378
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,292
during the intensity
of athletic competition.

379
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:19,004
[Diller] Low doses of amphetamine
or amphetamine-like drugs

380
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:22,215
get anyone who takes it, child or adult,

381
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,302
to become more deliberate
and more methodical.

382
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:28,013
They will tend to stick with things longer

383
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,098
that are not of interest or are boring.

384
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:37,564
Adderall had this
holistic enhancing effect

385
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,441
to my life at that time.

386
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:44,780
It helped me in the meetings,
film study, game review.

387
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,449
It helped me dealing with the pain.

388
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,620
That was really
what spurned on this thing,

389
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:55,499
like, "I just have to get access to this,

390
00:22:55,582 --> 00:23:00,337
and I have to do it the right way because
I don't wanna fail a drug test.

391
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,505
I don't wanna do any of that.

392
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,715
But this is something
that can really help me."

393
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:07,010
[Hinshaw] If you are a
professional athlete in the United States,

394
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:10,806
you can't take stimulants unless you have
what's called an exemption.

395
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:14,392
And a doctor must certify
that you legitimately have ADHD

396
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,395
and the stimulants
aren't just performance enhancers,

397
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,022
but they're part of your medication.

398
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,775
[Eben] I wasn't even that big then.

399
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:27,781
I was so happy because it was so obvious
that he took it one day,

400
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,658
and then that night,

401
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,869
he was doing exactly
what I had been wanting him to do.

402
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:36,248
Right away, I'd take the trash out
or I'd do the dishes.

403
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:40,877
And I organized my DVD collection
by director, alphabetically.

404
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:44,589
And I think I even called my mom
and told her,

405
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:45,882
"This is so great.

406
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:49,803
Eb's been diagnosed with ADD
and he's doing the dishes."

407
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:53,140
And I was like, "This is really good.

408
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,684
I'm making her happy.

409
00:23:55,767 --> 00:24:02,482
I'm not coming home
and just crashing on the couch."

410
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,615
[Nathanael] The very first time
I took Adderall,

411
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:14,119
I had ADHD symptoms
and I went to see a military doctor,

412
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,913
and I got a prescription.
I really didn't like it.

413
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,666
It made me more focused on my distractions

414
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:22,169
rather than more focused
on what I was supposed to be doing.

415
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:26,298
And so I didn't take it again
until this year.

416
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:30,510
I was doing a really intensive
programming boot camp.

417
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:33,346
Someone offered it to me,
and it was 1:00 in the morning.

418
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:37,184
I was like, "I've had a prescription,
so I don't feel too bad about this."

419
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,477
I took him up on it and it really helped.

420
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,815
It was definitely jet fuel. Yeah.

421
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,818
I didn't need much at all.
I'd take five or ten milligrams a day.

422
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,946
Problems that were previously
really exhausting,

423
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:54,451
or maybe seemed insurmountable,
were interesting challenges.

424
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,579
I had the discipline to tear myself
away from work,

425
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,956
come home at 11:00, and in ten minutes,

426
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,042
just like, protein shake,
brush teeth, go to bed.

427
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,669
And then I went, "Adderall.

428
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,756
Warning, side effects may include
being awesome at everything."

429
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,550
And that's how it felt.

430
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,678
I'm sure for a lot of people,
they would say, or believe,

431
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,347
or it might be true,

432
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:19,184
that they're just trying to be
the best programmers they can be.

433
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:22,395
But for most people,
I think the end goal is money.

434
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,398
[cell phone ringing]

435
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:29,361
Hello. Thank you.
All right, cool. Later.

436
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:34,366
The best description
of the first time I took Adderall

437
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,701
is kind of like somebody
pulls back the curtain,

438
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:40,580
and now you're able to focus
on each person in the audience.

439
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,874
Okay, tell her Blue called.

440
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,210
Adderall definitely helps you
be a better capitalist.

441
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:48,713
When I'm on my Adderall,
I'm here to solve problems.

442
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,007
What's the problem?
Line 'em up, I knock 'em down.

443
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,550
[woman] She said 175.

444
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,677
[Blue] Let me tell 'em.

445
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,139
I've been blessed to work with
Outkast and CeeLo Green, Nick Cannon.

446
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,141
As a manager,
you deal with so many different people.

447
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,601
I deal with the business managers,

448
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,728
the label, the accountants,
the tour agents.

449
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:07,107
When you're on your Adderall,
it is easier to keep track of people

450
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,484
and to call those people back
'cause you don't forget.

451
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,069
Yo, Mario, it's Blue calling you back.

452
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,780
When you're not on it, people,
you get to 'em when you get to 'em.

453
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:15,991
You're just mad 'cause
the good managers are from New York.

454
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,327
We're gonna get to work
on this PowerPoint slide

455
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,955
for the Wild 'n Out Summer Pool Parties.

456
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:25,333
The deal I'm cutting is,
any sponsorships we bring in,

457
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,793
we can split with the hotel.

458
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,128
[woman] Is there a deadline?

459
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:32,549
[Blue] It's Monday.
Wednesday would be the ideal time.

460
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,801
If this was Puff, he'd want it Wednesday.

461
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:37,887
Morning, when I get back from Chicago,
I want that deck.

462
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,015
-[woman] With his cheesecake.
-Thank you.

463
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:58,491
In high school, the only reason
why I really knew Adderall

464
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:01,077
was because my siblings
were prescribed it.

465
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:04,289
But no one took it to study,
no one took it to party.

466
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:07,792
It's so hard,
minus all the ethical implications,

467
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:11,171
but knowing that it's out there
and it's so easy

468
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,965
and you're just ignoring that,
you're ignoring.

469
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,551
You'll take the B when you know
you could have gotten an A

470
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:19,220
just by popping a $2 pill,
if you're gonna buy.

471
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:23,266
You also aren't worried
about getting in trouble for it

472
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,186
because you're just a kid
with a learning disability.

473
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:29,856
You're not a drug...
You didn't purchase drugs illegally.

474
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,566
I can see a lot of people

475
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:35,236
that are concerned about buying
or selling illegal drugs.

476
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,240
Like, that would be just the same
as them buying heroin.

477
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,867
They can process that.

478
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,827
But for a ton of people like us,

479
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:46,289
you would never be scared
of getting caught by a campus police,

480
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,792
or your professor would tell someone,

481
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:52,253
'cause it's really not thought of
as a drug in your mind.

482
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,175
[Delaney] I forgot to take
my morning meds today.

483
00:27:57,258 --> 00:28:01,096
Not Adderall. Nope. It can be unfair.

484
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:04,516
I have a weird relationship
with the way that I think about it,

485
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:08,144
because I was surrounded by people
that had a lot more money than I did.

486
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,063
I had to work in high school,

487
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:13,400
and I couldn't afford private tutors
for classes.

488
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:17,070
So, on one hand, I feel like,
if you were someone like me,

489
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:22,492
using Adderall could have been
leveling out the playing field.

490
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:25,620
But on the other hand,
if you're someone like some of those kids,

491
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:29,290
then you're just giving yourself
even more of a leg-up.

492
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,584
I'm from the Midwest,

493
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:34,879
from a place that has a lot
of problems with meth.

494
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:40,135
You see all this stuff on the news,
and the juxtaposition between

495
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,138
the meth-head
that lives in the trailer park

496
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,472
that we learned about in D.A.R.E.,

497
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:48,268
versus the kids whose parents make
well over six figures a year.

498
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:51,020
They're both tweaking out,
if you think about it.

499
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:54,774
Just like opiate painkillers
are heroin in a pill,

500
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:58,278
ADHD medicine is a small dose
of meth in a pill.

501
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:02,866
When we think about methamphetamine
from a chemical perspective,

502
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:07,078
and we think about amphetamine,
the active ingredient in Adderall,

503
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,998
the only difference between these drugs

504
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:14,127
is an additional methyl group
on the methamphetamine compound.

505
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,255
Methamphetamine is legal
in the United States for prescription.

506
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:20,800
It's a Schedule II drug,
just like Adderall is a Schedule II drug.

507
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:24,554
But people don't prescribe it as much
because of the public hysteria

508
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,014
surrounding illicit methamphetamine.

509
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,348
[officer] We got a search warrant.

510
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,685
They said meth would help me
get through my exams.

511
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,941
[Hart] So we think about people
who have meth labs,

512
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:40,361
we think about people
who are living in rural America,

513
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,655
all within a negative context.

514
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,450
Then, we contrast that
with another amphetamine

515
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:46,701
that has similar effects.

516
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,162
[woman] Girls, time for your Adderall.

517
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,165
What time did you guys
get home last night?

518
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:53,666
Uh, late.

519
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,127
We oftentimes think of that
in a different context.

520
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,838
We think about people
who have prescriptions for Adderall,

521
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,465
we think about college students,

522
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:03,009
we think about people in our society
who we like.

523
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:07,263
I just ended up accidentally taking,
like, six Adderall.

524
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,431
I stayed up all night,

525
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:12,435
I did a real deep dive into
Ryan Dillon Davidson's Facebook page,

526
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,353
and I found some shit.

527
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:17,732
Wealthier kids have access
to purified pharmaceutical speed,

528
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:22,237
and other communities have access to meth.
You know, cooked meth.

529
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:28,034
Although the potency is definitely greater
in crystal meth, in smoking it, etcetera,

530
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:30,829
at the neuroreceptor sites,
it has the exact same effects.

531
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,416
[Leigh] I'm surrounded
by very privileged people.

532
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,294
These are wealthy people in America.

533
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,046
We have the money to get tested,

534
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,882
the resources to afford being medicated
every day of your life,

535
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:46,177
where you can maximize everything.

536
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:51,057
Even negotiating the healthcare system
and finding the right doctors

537
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,476
is also a matter of privilege, right?

538
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,563
Some people know how to do it
and a lot of people don't.

539
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:59,732
If you have the right connections,
if you know who to go see,

540
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:02,235
I think that also becomes easier to do.

541
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:10,743
Adderall is perfect
for finance work and any type of work

542
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,413
where you have to be detail-oriented,

543
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:15,415
which is what finance work is.

544
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:17,000
While I was at Goldman,

545
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:21,296
I never told anybody
that wasn't under the age of 25.

546
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:25,466
You had to feel it out before
you would ever reveal you took Adderall.

547
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:29,512
And I think there is this fear that,
if you reveal it,

548
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:33,391
then, A, they've never heard of it,
they don't get it.

549
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:36,728
And B, they'll view you as weaker,
as inferior,

550
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:40,440
and they may view you as somebody
that can't keep up.

551
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:44,235
When getting it from my friends
became expensive,

552
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,405
I decided it was time
to find a doctor in New York.

553
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:50,283
So, all I did was send a text
to a few friends.

554
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:55,163
So I ended up going to Central Park South,
and it was a fancy office,

555
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,206
and it was a nice old man.

556
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,501
And I think once he heard
I work for Goldman Sachs,

557
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,502
he was like, "Okay, cool.

558
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:06,507
He's normal, he'll be fine.
He's a version of my idea of successful.

559
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,927
I can write him
whatever prescription he needs."

560
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:13,389
I probably have six or seven friends
that go to him currently.

561
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,858
There was a great line in a comedy,
Silicon Valley,

562
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:28,363
when one of the tech workers
needed Adderall and couldn't find it,

563
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,907
and the line was,
"Just go out on the street on a bicycle.

564
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,493
Half the kids in Palo Alto are taking it."

565
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:34,661
Hey.

566
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:39,832
Any of you guys currently on Adderall

567
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:43,628
and, you know, want to make $50?

568
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,130
This is the generation
beginning in the mid-'90s

569
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:50,843
that was widely exposed to the use
of Adderall and Ritalin and Concerta,

570
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:51,928
amongst their peers.

581
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:20,164
[Jasper] I learned about ADD
after being on the medication,

582
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,875
so, I didn't know what it was.

583
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,460
All I knew was it was for school.

584
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:28,965
It was always just about
being easier on the teachers

585
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:32,677
and being easier on my parents
and just being not as loud.

586
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,971
And, I guess, focusing.

587
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:37,849
But I never had interest in school,

588
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:40,685
and I focused in, always,
what I wanted to focus in.

589
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:44,147
And that was art and, I guess,

590
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:47,859
reading when I could read,
which took some time.

591
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:53,948
All right. Let's see, man.
How's everything? How's the art?

592
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,201
Good. I got to get ready
to do my senior show this year show.

Yeah, but not as much.
I take them when I need them.

597
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,128
[doctor] Okay. So sporadically,
like we've done before?

Yeah. And I kind of think
I would like to stop soon.

this is just developmental in the brain,

601
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,555
and as you get more mature,

602
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:21,142
your brain grows more mature,
those neurons start making connections.

603
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,310
Then you don't need to use them.

604
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,145
[Jasper] Yeah.
I would like to be done with it.

605
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,646
[doctor] Let's see.

606
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:29,567
-I've had enough since third grade.
-Yeah.

607
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,530
[Jasper] Should I mash these tomatoes?

608
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,740
[Regina] Yeah, I'll help if you want.

609
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:36,949
[Jasper] Yes. Do it by hand?

610
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:40,078
Just get in there, yeah.
It says crush them by hand.

611
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:41,746
You're doing fine.

612
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,167
Go gentle. Gently.

613
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,712
[Jasper] I went to a Montessori school
when I was younger,

614
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,464
along with my sister and cousins.

615
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,800
You wanna start slicing that?
I'll do this.

616
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:54,717
Sure.

617
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,053
[Jasper] They did well in those schools,
and I didn't.

618
00:34:57,136 --> 00:35:01,557
When he was little, everybody else would
know their alphabet and numbers.

619
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:06,354
And he couldn't necessarily identify
a number from a letter.

620
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,231
-Sorry.
-That's okay.

621
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:11,901
So, we had him tested,
and they said that he had ADD.

622
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:16,739
So we moved him to another school
that really...

623
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,825
A very good school, very good.

624
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,620
[Regina] His third-grade teacher,
halfway through the year,

625
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:25,790
said something about
him being on medication.

626
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:29,085
I'm like, "Well, he's not on medication."

627
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:32,046
And she goes, "Everybody in this class
is on medication."

628
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,631
And I'm like, "He's not."

629
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:37,385
She goes, "Well, I think that
you might want to try it."

630
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:41,180
I was only there for two years
before being prescribed Adderall.

631
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,116
[Regina] It was definitely a hard decision

632
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:03,369
because I was afraid it was gonna hurt
his creativity.

633
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:07,790
I mean, even at three, you could just see
he had something.

634
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,250
I didn't want to ruin that.

635
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:13,796
I tried it, and there was a difference
in him that

636
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,883
was just able to concentrate more.

637
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:19,802
I tested it,
because I wanted to see what it did.

638
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:23,014
And apparently, I have ADHD, too,
because it worked.

639
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:27,018
So, it just helps you concentrate.

640
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,936
So do you think I have ADD, or...

641
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,398
We won't know that until the Ritalin helps
this concentration problem.

642
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:37,069
[Hinshaw] Not so many years ago,
the medical profession thought,

643
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:39,864
"Wait a minute. I'm not sure
if this kid has ADHD or not.

644
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:43,618
There's no definitive test. I'll give her
a stimulant and see if it works.

645
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:46,746
If it works, she has ADHD.
If it doesn't, she doesn't."

646
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,915
Interesting idea, probably wrong.

647
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:53,252
Most everybody who takes a stimulant
does focus better and longer,

648
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,879
can pull that all-nighter.

649
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:56,547
[Jasper] I was being forced to take pills.

650
00:36:56,631 --> 00:37:00,218
That's the thing. I'm not doing it
'cause it's fun and stuff.

651
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,802
I'm doing it 'cause I have to.

652
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,973
When I was in 9th grade,
I was taking 50 milligrams a day.

653
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,393
I'd get home from school
still grinding my teeth, still wired.

654
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,562
I'd be up till 6:00 in the morning,

655
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:16,567
just painting in my room
'cause I'd still be wired from it.

656
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:21,322
The only difference between
children and adults, as far as I can see,

657
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:25,952
in the use of these medicines,
is children don't like the higher doses.

658
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:30,748
As they get higher, they say,
"I feel nervous, I feel weird."

659
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:34,919
And something happens in mid adolescence,
that the older adolescents

660
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:39,048
and adults will often say,
"I feel powerful, I feel grand."

661
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,592
[Jasper] I was super embarrassed by it.

662
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,386
When I started going to public school,

663
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,471
it was like, "Yeah, I'm on medicine."

664
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:50,434
I thought it was funny, just being like,
"I have to take pills to calm down."

665
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,895
I was always yelling upstairs,

666
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,314
"Did you take your pills?"

667
00:37:55,398 --> 00:38:00,152
Or, if he was not listening to me
or behaving badly,

668
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:03,239
I would also ask that question,
which is probably

669
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,825
more of the annoyance
of why he picked up on that.

670
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:16,669
[Jasper] That's when I started writing
stuff like "Take your pills."

671
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,045
And trying to force myself

672
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:22,049
to be proud of the fact that
I can zone in on something

673
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,135
and completely ignore everything.

674
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,219
I started to be proud of it.

675
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:30,599
Getting up was the obsession.

676
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:34,478
Just going around with people
and being, "That's me."

677
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:38,524
[Regina] They're just beautiful.
Everything he does I love.

678
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:43,529
[Jasper] The paintings don't really go
with the idea of being on Adderall,

679
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:46,907
except for just being super meticulous
and super correct,

680
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,160
and repeated over and over again.

681
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:53,497
That's what I found to be the connection
between that and my Adderall,

682
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,666
was just the obsessiveness.

683
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,882
[Ariana] Everyone says this.
For some reason, everyone's like,

684
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,759
"Everyone has a little ADD."

685
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:07,803
No, that's not true.
We have distractions in our life,

686
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:11,682
but not everyone has a brain that
functions like somebody's with ADHD.

687
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:16,354
One of my earliest memories
is being diagnosed.

688
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:21,108
It's pretty detrimental for people
to constantly be saying things like that,

689
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,445
because it kind of illegitimizes...
Is that a word?

690
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:30,534
[chuckling] Illegitimizes the struggle

691
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,704
and the actual power that ADHD might have
over somebody's life.

692
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,664
And it is a disorder.

693
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:39,126
It causes a lot of issues,
and there's a stigma around it.

694
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,129
And I think that people throw it off

695
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,549
like it's nothing and like everyone has
a bit of it, but it's not true.

696
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:52,431
[Blue] A lot of people out there think
they have it because they can't focus.

697
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:56,685
But they really can't focus because
society has just taught you not to focus.

698
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,562
We've become this one-minute society.

699
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,315
Everything is about
shortening attention spans anyway.

700
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:07,571
So, society, overall, now has ADD.

701
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:11,867
So then, where's the line between
those that actually were born with it,

702
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,745
and those that have grown up
in an ADD society.

703
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,498
I think that's where
we really are right now.

704
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,834
I try and stay out of the pool
during photo shoots.

705
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:23,421
-Nick looks like he's really struggling.
-Man, a hard day's work.

706
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,256
[laughing] It's a tough life today.

707
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:28,217
I didn't have medication in mind
when I went to the doctor.

708
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:32,054
I kind of knew
that I had the signs of ADHD,

709
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,973
just looking at peers, Russell Simmons,

710
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:36,851
and then I placed myself
somewhere on that spectrum.

711
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,520
I talked to Russell a couple of times.

712
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:42,690
His answer was,
"I don't take medicine. I do yoga."

713
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:43,774
And I went to yoga with him.

714
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:48,529
I was like, "I don't know if this is
gonna get it done for me right now."

715
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,114
Here we go.

716
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:54,743
[Maxine] We never had a discussion
about his ADD as a child.

717
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,871
I didn't think he needed to have a label.

718
00:40:56,954 --> 00:41:01,292
I think he needed to understand
that he needed coping skills.

719
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:04,503
She never took me to a doctor
to even consider medication.

720
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,965
She wanted me to learn how to function
within the confines

721
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:10,676
of what I was
and who I was going to grow up to be.

722
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:14,722
Shit, am I in the shot again?
Am I in the shot again? My bad.

723
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,807
Having been a special ed teacher,

724
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,935
I've watched, to me,

725
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:25,274
systemic administration of drugs
to little black boys.

726
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:29,028
I know upon viewing that,
I really did not want to...

727
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:31,405
I must say black and Hispanic little boys.

728
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,908
I knew that I did not want that
for my child.

729
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:37,620
So it was not a happy moment
when he announced that,

730
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:40,581
after all those years
of not using medication,

731
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,917
that he felt he needed to do that.

732
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,046
As a kid, I thought of Ritalin
as what you put the crazy kids on.

733
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:49,548
Not knowing that I, technically,
should I have been on it.

734
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:53,385
Everyone was to go on Ritalin
and that was the instant cure.

735
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:57,181
I didn't see it as instant cure,
so I would never agree to it.

736
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,391
Just ran him outside a lot.

737
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:00,935
[chuckling]

738
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,686
Ritalin started as a love story.

739
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:08,108
A scientist in Switzerland
was fiddling around with compounds

740
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,402
and things that were close to amphetamine.

741
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:15,115
He came up with something he thought
might help his wife be more peppy,

742
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:19,328
play better tennis, literally,
and maybe keep her weight down.

743
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,372
He was like,
"There's really something to this."

744
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:25,167
Her name, Marguerite.
She was actually known as Rita,

745
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,753
and so he named it Ritaline.

746
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:32,675
And it was only after Ciba,
the Swiss company, put it on the market,

747
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:37,471
that they took off the '"E,"
and we now know it forever as Ritalin.

748
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,230
[Conners] In the beginning,

749
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:49,984
we were completely enamored
of the short term effect.

750
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,113
There's nothing so gratifying

751
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:58,701
as to have the parent come
the day after you first give a pill

752
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:01,579
and say, you know, "I can't believe it.

753
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,706
He's actually... He's normal.

754
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:06,125
He's a likable kid now."

755
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:08,460
Oh, you're such a good girl.

756
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:12,923
[Schwarz] Keith Conners was
a seminal figure in the history of ADHD.

757
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:16,051
He developed the primary rating scale

758
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:19,888
that was used by doctors
to help understand

759
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,182
the clinical picture in children.

760
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:26,604
He worked on behalf of pharmaceutical
companies evaluating new drugs.

761
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:29,315
Nobody knew anything about all this stuff.

762
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:33,360
These were difference makers
in mental health.

763
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,280
What these doctors
at Johns Hopkins were doing

764
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:39,450
was seeing if there was another pill

765
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:42,119
other than amphetamine,
which had a terrible reputation,

766
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:44,705
that might help these troubled children.

767
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:47,458
Now, how are you
going to get methylphenidate?

768
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:50,169
The only way to get it
is to ask Ciba for it,

769
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:51,754
the Swiss company that marketed it.

770
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:55,007
They said, "Hey, Ciba,
can we have a gazillion pills?"

771
00:43:55,090 --> 00:44:00,971
And this oil drum sized barrel
of Ritalin pills

772
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:04,600
ends up coming to Johns Hopkins
so they can do their trials.

773
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:10,898
[Conners] In those days it was possible
to go to the principal and say,

774
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:14,026
"You know, we're trying out a new drug."

775
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:15,944
And he'd say, "Oh, my God,

776
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:20,282
if you could calm these little bastards
down, it would be wonderful."

777
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:24,995
We arranged a study on the spot

778
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:28,749
and did a two-week trial.

779
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:32,127
The children called the pills math pills.

780
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,339
Because, for the first time,

781
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:39,176
they were able to sit down
and do sums and learn.

782
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:43,472
The hyperactivity and inability
to pay attention among children,

783
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:45,849
has been understood for a long time.

784
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,185
That's the way some kids are.

785
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:51,522
And one of the first names was
Minimal Brain Damage.

786
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:55,234
They assumed that there
was some sort of damage to the brain.

787
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:57,528
Either in birth or encephalitis.

788
00:44:57,611 --> 00:45:01,115
It became increasingly clear that
that really wasn't the case.

789
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:05,285
They said,
"How about minimal brain dysfunction?"

790
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:10,207
It was only in 1980 that focus began,
if you will,

791
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:13,877
on the concept of inattention in children.

792
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:17,881
How about attention deficit disorder.

793
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:22,636
It had been rebranded as something
that people were willing to accept.

794
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:27,015
And people were willing
to allow medication for.

795
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:31,353
[Rasmussen] In 1996, another company
reintroduced, effectively, amphetamine,

796
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:33,564
same old amphetamine,
for attention deficit

797
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:35,816
on the US market as Adderall.

798
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:39,820
And it's grown to absolutely
enormous proportions ever since then.

799
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,905
[psychedelic music playing]

800
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:56,211
The drug that became Adderall,
its original name was Obetrol.

801
00:45:57,254 --> 00:46:02,468
A pharmaceutical businessman heard
Obetrol was being used occasionally

802
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:06,555
to treat what was at the time
of course known as ADD.

803
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:12,561
And he's like, "ADD, all, Adderall."

804
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,022
That's where the name came from.

805
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:26,158
One of the interesting phenomenas
for me is listening to experts

806
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:28,285
who were on the ground floor of this.

807
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:29,620
People like Keith Conners,

808
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:35,459
now having major questions and regrets
about the outcomes of what they had done.

809
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:38,128
The medicalizing of everyday life,

810
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:41,507
that everybody could
potentially have a disorder,

811
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:44,635
ultimately trivializes the entire process,

812
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:49,389
and also puts the whole society
in the hands of doctors and Big Pharma.

813
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:52,518
[interviewer] Would you include yourself
as being in the ADHD business?

814
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,394
Or having been at one point?

815
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,855
I think I was in the ADHD business,

816
00:46:56,939 --> 00:47:02,277
and I wasn't really cognizant
of how much I was in that business.

817
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:06,198
Uh, there are big bucks
waiting for doctors

818
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:11,078
who file patients through quickly
and give them prescriptions

819
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:15,916
without knowing what
the down effects are going to be.

820
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:20,087
Some of which are good,
but some of which are quite bad.

821
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:25,259
The United States also
is one of only two developed nations

822
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,886
that allows
the direct to consumer advertising

823
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,513
of controlled substances.

824
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,390
So when it came to ADHD drugs,

825
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:34,643
it wasn't just for children
who are hyperactive,

826
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:37,563
who can't concentrate in school.

827
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:40,524
What they wanted to do is
make the mothers more comfortable.

828
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:43,527
"Oh, my goodness,
my kid now takes out the garbage!

829
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:46,822
What a wonderful world,
thanks to Adderall XR."

830
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:50,659
Every mother is going to be
seduced by an ad

831
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:54,329
that appears to promise
better grades in a pill

832
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,748
and better grades in a diagnosis.

833
00:47:56,832 --> 00:48:02,254
It was grotesque what these companies did
in the pursuit of profit.

834
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:17,769
[Hebert] Give it up. Hey, man,
thank y'all for coming out.

835
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,814
Good to see you. You all right?
Good to see you.

836
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:24,901
My name is Dr. Corey Hebert
and I have a lot of stuff going on.

837
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,612
But I am a physician first.

838
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:29,364
I'm back.
It's me, the doctor for the people.

839
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:32,075
You got to get rid of your stress.
It's killing you.

840
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,286
Seeing patient to patient
to patient to patient,

841
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:37,456
at the end of the day,
I've changed 30 people's lives

842
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:39,124
and maybe their family.

843
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:43,462
But when I'm in the media, I'm talking
to a million people at one time.

844
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:48,133
Dr. Corey Hebert is an ER physician
at the LSU Health Sciences Center.

845
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,303
[Hebert] The way a child sees himself

846
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:53,430
and how a child learns
to cope in the world,

847
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:54,973
along with his self-esteem and confidence,

848
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:58,435
is just as important to his success
as his physical health,

849
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:00,854
because ADHD is a medical problem.

850
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,986
My brother. Good to see you. How you been?

851
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,988
-Good.
-You're looking good.

852
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:13,867
I'm going to make my patients do well,
and they're going to be successful

853
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:17,371
with all the tools
that I have in my arsenal.

854
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:20,624
And that's the bottom line.
I have to do that.

855
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:22,376
And I know some people say,

856
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:26,046
"Well, maybe you should not use
medicines as much."

857
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,048
Well, come sit in my chair.

858
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:32,302
What you must do
is make the correct diagnosis,

859
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:35,514
not over diagnose and not over medicate.

860
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,766
-Tell me how school's going.
-It's going all right.

861
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:40,519
"All right"?
What does that mean, "All right"?

862
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:42,896
Are you making A's, you making B's,
you making C's?

863
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:45,691
[Sherry] The part I like, he don't talk
to him as if he's his doctor.

864
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:47,734
He talks to him like he cares.

865
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,653
All the doctors we had, it's go in,

866
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:52,739
they check everything
and write an appointment.

867
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,408
"We'll see you back here in four weeks."

868
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,034
But with Dr. Hebert, it's not like that.

869
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:57,994
What about side effects from the medicine?

870
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:01,039
You been feeling tired?
Tell me what you've been feeling.

871
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,040
-No.
-No.

872
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:03,917
Stomach ache, headache,
anything like that?

873
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,086
-Headaches. Yeah.
-You get headaches?

874
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,087
How often are you getting them?

875
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,923
He was diagnosed with ADD when he was six.

876
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,467
And I heard all the stigma,

877
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,803
how the medication make the children feel.

878
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:17,347
For two years, I went
without giving him medication.

879
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:21,560
We tried therapy and everything,
and nothing would work.

880
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:23,061
He actually had to repeat kindergarten.

881
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:26,565
Were you taking your medicine
and then suddenly stopped taking it?

882
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:27,649
Yeah.

883
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:31,027
Come on, man, you're killing me.
You're killing me.

884
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:34,072
When you started taking it again,
you started to get headaches.

885
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,532
-Yeah.
-Okay, I'm glad.

886
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:37,075
You got to tell me this stuff.

887
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:40,454
The first set of meds,
I didn't like the way it had him at all.

888
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:43,623
Wouldn't talk, wouldn't eat,
couldn't sleep.

889
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:46,752
He already don't say much anyways.
So we got Adderall.

890
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:50,172
When he first started school,
he was taking it every day

891
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:53,633
and he had 2.53,

892
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,052
and now his grades are dropping...

893
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:59,055
'cause he don't take his meds.

894
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,558
But he's at the age where
I won't force him to take it,

895
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:04,478
'cause he knows the difference,
and he's in high school.

896
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:08,148
If those are the consequences
he want to deal with, that's on him.

897
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:12,027
But I don't like the effects
of it sometimes, either.

898
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:14,905
Y'all good to go.

899
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:19,451
If a child has ADHD,

900
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:22,329
we'll do whatever it takes
to get them to the next level.

901
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:25,957
Whether it be medicine,
therapy or some other intervention.

902
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,250
But something must happen.

903
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:30,420
[Sherry] I was the first in my family
to graduate from high school.

904
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:33,298
And I always tell my kids,
"I don't want you to be like me.

905
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:34,549
I want you to be better than me.

906
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:38,845
So because I have a master's degree,
then I want you to get a doctorate.

907
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,430
I want to be able to call you Dr. King."

908
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,683
-That's him right there.
-[indistinct shouting]

909
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:49,189
That's my baby. [chuckles]

910
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:51,149
When he's not on his meds,

911
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:55,445
he reacts and does things without
thinking about the consequences.

912
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,906
He knows that he should take them,

913
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:00,158
it's that he don't like
the side effects to them.

914
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,619
He won't take it Friday
and Saturday or Sunday.

915
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:05,831
If he takes it Monday,
it slows him down completely,

916
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,666
almost to zombie state.

917
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:11,878
A lot of his friends
don't have to deal with that.

918
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,798
So it makes him feel like he's not normal.

919
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:17,884
So he'd just rather not take it.

920
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,682
[whistling]

921
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:26,560
[interviewer] What was the research
you were able to do about Adderall?

922
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:30,146
[Regina] I went to the doctor,
we tried one medicine, it didn't work,

923
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:33,608
and then we tried this
and I saw a difference immediately.

924
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:36,069
Come into my shop.

925
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:38,530
[Regina] Did I do research?

926
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:40,574
Shamefully, no.

927
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,619
[interviewer] But you were acting
on the guidance of...

928
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:49,916
The psychologist, the doctor,
I guess, his pediatrician.

929
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,127
I guess, the teachers at school.

930
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:55,338
My sister, whose kid was on Ritalin.

931
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:59,759
I don't know if I would have done it.
Now, I google how to open a can.

932
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,094
I google everything.

933
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:06,099
But then, I don't know that I would
even have thought to do that.

934
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,018
[blows]

935
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:11,438
[Jasper] I got to school
and I stopped taking it so much.

936
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,523
I only take it when I write, really.

937
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,735
This isn't pot and booze.

938
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:19,571
This is meth
and it's screwing with your liver.

939
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:22,866
When I was in senior year,
I wasn't allowed to drink or anything

940
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:25,410
because they were worried
it was shutting down.

941
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:29,247
My blood work wasn't looking good.
There was too many enzymes or something.

942
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:32,292
I had to constantly be looking
at my poop to see what color it was.

943
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,836
If that's the case,
then this isn't worth it.

944
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:41,426
So what do we know about
the safety issues with stimulants?

945
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:44,387
There are cardiovascular risks.

946
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:47,599
There's also a risk
of a psychotic episode,

947
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:51,269
even for people
who don't have a history of psychosis.

948
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:56,024
There's a risk of addiction, long-term.

949
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:59,527
People can become dependent
on these drugs,

950
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:03,073
and that's, you know, a horrible fate.

951
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:05,325
You wouldn't wish that
on your worst enemy.

952
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:08,620
[Peter] Whether they realize it or not,

953
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:11,581
they're banking on the fact
that we take Adderall.

954
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:15,835
The perfect employee at an investment bank

955
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:20,382
or the perfect employee at a tech firm
is somebody that doesn't say no.

956
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:30,767
There is a culture of, "You do stay up
16 hours for seven days straight."

957
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:35,855
If the kid to your right and the kid
to your left are producing these outputs,

958
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,607
then you should be able to produce them.

959
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:40,902
But if they are taking Adderall,

960
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:43,071
then you should probably
be taking Adderall.

961
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:52,205
I was coming out of a particularly rough
few weeks of work.

962
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:55,125
I was working with a notorious asshole
on Wall Street.

963
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:59,254
He had another analyst and myself
working around the clock.

964
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:02,841
And we were up for two and a half days
doing Adderall.

965
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:09,055
We present all this work that
we'd been doing to the managing director.

966
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:13,768
And he flips through it
and immediately starts saying,

967
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:18,106
"Wait, this isn't what I asked for.
I actually need this, this and this."

968
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:22,235
I turned to this guy in my impaired state,
and I said,

969
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:25,864
"Fuck you.
This is exactly what you asked for."

970
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:31,870
And so the next day, I go into work,
keep my head down low,

971
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:34,789
and the associate comes over to me.

972
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:37,083
He goes, "Did you hear
what happened last night?

973
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,919
About two or three hours
after you left the office,

974
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:45,175
the other analyst that you'd been working
with had a seizure from exhaustion,

975
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,260
and he's in the hospital right now."

976
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:50,055
I immediately go and call him.

977
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:53,725
He picks up the phone
and I ask him how he is,

978
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,852
and he says,
"My parents are trying to make me quit.

979
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:59,147
My parents think that enough is enough.

980
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:02,484
But can you send me this file?
I'm being asked for it."

981
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:04,319
[EKG beeping]

982
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:10,950
[Delaney] When I was in high school,
everyone told me,

983
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,202
"You'll love college.

984
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:14,454
You'll finally be able to
take classes that you enjoy."

985
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:18,666
I like business,
but it doesn't feed my soul.

986
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:21,086
I take it because it's relevant.

987
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:26,007
Stimulants are generally gonna
help people a lot before they hurt them.

988
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,885
They gave them to pilots in World War II.

989
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:31,096
It will give you something that you want
in the short term,

990
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:35,266
and so then you're primed that a pill
is going to give me what I want.

991
00:56:36,017 --> 00:56:37,852
"That medicine helped me study,

992
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:39,771
and I did much better
than I would have without it.

993
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:41,106
I'm gonna do it again."

994
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:44,567
And then, "Now I can't sleep.
Does anybody have anything for sleep?"

995
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:47,445
People need to understand
that if you abuse the stimulants,

996
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:48,363
and young people do,

997
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:51,241
we've had many patients
that is their drug of choice.

998
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:54,494
They tend to pair them with
something that's a downer, like alcohol.

999
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:57,539
It's easy to have an alcohol overdose
if you're on stimulants

1000
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:59,666
because you'll be able
to drink a lot more,

1001
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:02,001
and then the stimulants wear off
and you're in a blackout.

1002
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:05,421
People use it for work,
and so they think it's okay.

1003
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:08,216
I have friends
that have gotten to the point

1004
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:11,886
where they can't really do work
without taking Adderall.

1005
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:15,431
You get used to it,
and then you can't do work without it.

1006
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:18,059
You can't be productive.
I've seen that happen to people.

1007
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:22,397
Most people can use amphetamine
without becoming addicted.

1008
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,609
But ultimately, too large
a group of people become addicted,

1009
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:32,449
so it becomes unacceptable for the society
to put this much speed out there.

1010
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:36,161
And we're absolutely
in one of those growing waves right now.

1011
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:41,082
Those of us on the front line have been
feeling this for about eight to ten years.

1012
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:43,460
And right at the moment,

1013
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:47,464
the doctor-prescribed opiate abuse
epidemic is taking center stage,

1014
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:50,717
but I'm telling you,
Adderall is right below

1015
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:54,095
the threshold of the opiates.

1016
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:12,030
[interviewer] Did you start to
attribute success to the Adderall?

1017
00:58:12,113 --> 00:58:15,408
I really struggled with not,
"Am I cheating?"

1018
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,452
But, "Is this really me anymore?"

1019
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:23,625
Should I still feel as good
about accomplishing something

1020
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:26,920
knowing that I took Adderall
and that really helped me

1021
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,421
focus on getting it done,

1022
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:35,303
rather than struggling
through my pain or exhaustion.

1023
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:38,139
Especially after I started
getting these injuries.

1024
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:41,226
Dislocated shoulder,
herniated disk in my back,

1025
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:48,233
L5-S1, torn MCL, torn hamstrings,
torn quads, had my bell rung.

1026
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:50,818
Adderall helped lift me out of that.

1027
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:57,283
The problem was,
that really productive feeling,

1028
00:58:57,367 --> 00:59:00,745
and feeling like
I'd conquered the world that day,

1029
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:06,501
it would fall off into this black spiral,
into a depression, and into...

1030
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:07,544
It was a crash.

1031
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:10,713
I'd start crashing off of it,
so then I'd take more.

1032
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:14,133
A 70 milligram time release in the morning

1033
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:17,762
and then supplementing
a couple 20 milligrams

1034
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:19,889
in there throughout the day.

1035
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,394
That crash doesn't really go away
when you take more.

1036
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:27,897
You spike up and then you're dipping
back down into the crash.

1037
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:33,236
It would be an exhaustion thing.

1038
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:38,575
Like, you're running,
but your body isn't going anywhere.

1039
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:44,122
You start to float away from yourself
in a way.

1040
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:50,587
[Blue] If you're feeling depressed
and you stop taking Adderall,

1041
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:53,881
it can lead to the depression more.

1042
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:55,633
That might just be me.

1043
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:57,302
Sometimes when you're not on it,

1044
00:59:57,385 --> 01:00:01,681
it's easy to get into your head
and just get lost in that space.

1045
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,351
[Leigh] It bums me out to know
I didn't do it myself.

1046
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,603
Me and the Adderall did it.

1047
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:09,230
It's definitely a competition
with yourself.

1048
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:14,527
[Jasper] It was definitely
an identity crisis, coming off of it.

1049
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:17,447
I will say, me being on it
and me being off of it

1050
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:19,574
is like two completely different people.

1051
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,243
Like, very different people.

1052
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:23,536
[player 1] Red three!

1053
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:26,205
[player 2] Halfway home.

1054
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:31,252
[Eben] Because it's an amphetamine
and it speeds up your metabolism,

1055
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:35,131
it dries you out,
it dehydrates your muscles and tissue,

1056
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:37,008
so you become more prone to injury.

1057
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:39,385
So that became a real challenge as well,

1058
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:44,474
staying hydrated through the use.

1059
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:46,643
I really believed he had ADD.

1060
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:52,148
It seemed like his was a medical issue
that was being treated.

1061
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:54,859
Whereas any time
I had used Adderall to study

1062
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:57,070
or anyone I knew
had used Adderall to study,

1063
01:00:57,153 --> 01:01:00,448
I looked at it as basically, abuse.
Substance abuse.

1064
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:03,576
But I didn't look at it that way
until later,

1065
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,120
when I realized how much he was taking.

1066
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:11,000
And then, when I started to also feel like
his sleep was being affected

1067
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:15,672
and he was maybe using other substances
to help him sleep,

1068
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:19,342
I started thinking,
"That's not a great cycle."

1069
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:24,597
[Eben] My prescription for Adderall
and Vyvanse had run out.

1070
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:28,017
And on a day I didn't have it,
I took a Ritalin.

1071
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:30,395
They both treat ADD/ADHD.

1072
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:34,649
That's what I have a therapeutic use
exemption for Adderall for.

1073
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:36,943
"It'll be the same thing.
It should be fine."

1074
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:41,322
So of course the day I took the Ritalin,
I took a drug test, failed it.

1075
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:48,621
They viewed it as
two different compounds, completely.

1076
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:51,249
And I was hit with a four-game suspension.

1077
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:53,751
[George Stephanopoulos] This morning,
America's golden girl targeted.

1078
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:55,920
[announcer] She's just got so much power.

1079
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:57,630
[Stephanopoulos]
The leaked documents reveal

1080
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:00,383
19-year-old Biles tested positive
for methylphenidate.

1081
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:02,885
[reporter] Simone was upfront
about taking the drugs

1082
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:06,305
and was given a therapeutic use exemption
for the medication she takes.

1083
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:07,890
[Stephanopoulos]
And one other decorated Olympian

1084
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:10,101
has grappled with ADHD, Michael Phelps.

1085
01:02:10,184 --> 01:02:11,686
But some people are now asking

1086
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:15,690
if those drugs gave her an unfair leg-up
at the Olympics.

1087
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:34,208
[Hinshaw] We've arrived
at the land of controversy.

1088
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:37,003
Should everybody get SAT tutors?

1089
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:40,882
That's enhancing performance,
but only certain families can afford it.

1090
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:43,426
Should everybody drink coffee?

1091
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:46,220
This goes way beyond psychiatry
or clinical psychology.

1092
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:47,638
It goes way beyond mental health.

1093
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:49,599
What's a level playing field?

1094
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:54,228
Stimulants and ADHD
are in the middle of that playing field.

1095
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:57,231
If we play our cards right,

1096
01:02:57,315 --> 01:03:01,944
we're going to have to bring ADHD,
mental health stigma,

1097
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:05,615
the use of medications out in the open,
and have a debate

1098
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:09,076
about what kind of performance enhancement
we should allow

1099
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,537
and what we value
and don't value in our society.

1100
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:19,045
[Nathanael] Your experience changes a lot,
as you spend time on a medication.

1101
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:25,301
Initially, it was definitely jet fuel.
I didn't need much at all.

1102
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:28,638
I'd take five or ten milligrams a day
and be fine.

1103
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:34,519
There was a lot of optimism, and a lot of
almost obsession with getting things done,

1104
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:37,730
but it was so fun.
And that's not really true anymore.

1105
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,190
So now I take 40 a day.

1106
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:43,486
I do things to make that stronger,
as well.

1107
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:47,657
I get up in the morning,

1108
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:51,118
and I have a milky, like, protein shake,
which is a base.

1109
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,997
If I were to have a glass of orange juice,

1110
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:57,583
that would be very acidic,

1111
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:01,921
and it would destroy a lot of the Adderall
before I absorbed it.

1112
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:13,933
Brain-hacking is a subset of the larger
biohacking sphere.

1113
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:17,520
Which is, "I wanna biohack myself
and run a mile faster."

1114
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:18,771
Probably the film Limitless

1115
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,774
has done more than anything else
to make the public think,

1116
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:25,570
"This is a thing. There are drugs
that can make a person smarter."

1117
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:28,865
Like, "Information is pouring into my head
like Neo in The Matrix."

1118
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:33,327
I know kung fu.

1119
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:34,871
For the last ten years,

1120
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:39,750
there's been a lot of discussion
about cognitive enhancement.

1121
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:45,006
A lot of the discussion has been
about the ethics of it.

1122
01:04:45,089 --> 01:04:46,173
Is it cheating?

1123
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:48,092
Or the safety of it.

1124
01:04:48,175 --> 01:04:50,595
But everybody seemed to be assuming that,

1125
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:53,472
of course,
it would enhance your cognition.

1126
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:58,603
So we decided to test and find out.

1127
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:00,897
In some very interesting data

1128
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:04,984
from Martha Farah
at University of Pennsylvania's lab,

1129
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:08,613
some of the initial trials had been done

1130
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:11,574
of college students
without any sign of ADHD

1131
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:14,785
taking either stimulants or placebo

1132
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:19,457
and every week, getting measures,
tests of learning.

1133
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:24,837
It was across a huge battery
of different tasks.

1134
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:30,009
In the end,
we found no significant difference

1135
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:33,262
between Adderall and placebo,

1136
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:36,474
except for one question.

1137
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:42,146
"Do you feel that the pill you took today
enhanced your cognition?"

1138
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:48,277
[Hinshaw] So one of the conclusions may be
that stimulants are very good at boosting

1139
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:51,072
your false self-confidence
and how well you're learning.

1140
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:54,742
People think of amphetamines
being smart pills. They're not.

1141
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:59,664
They certainly can help you stay awake
when you should be asleep,

1142
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:03,793
can help you endure a boring task
a lot longer.

1143
01:06:03,876 --> 01:06:07,755
But it doesn't add anything new
or cognition.

1144
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:12,802
The single, most universal effect
that amphetamine, Adderall,

1145
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:18,265
has on anyone who takes it,
is a feeling that they're doing better.

1146
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:24,188
That's not a small effect, because
the feeling of doing better at something

1147
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:27,274
improves your motivation
and confidence in doing it.

1148
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:28,943
If you feel good about yourself

1149
01:06:29,026 --> 01:06:31,362
and you feel more driven
to do what you wanna do,

1150
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:33,447
one could argue that
that's an enhancement,

1151
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:38,703
even if it's not actually increasing
your IQ in a very concrete sense.

1152
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:41,747
[Lawler] Often, Adderall is an entry point
for people

1153
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:45,501
into finding out that cognitive enhancers
are a thing.

1154
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:54,176
As a millennial male
that went to a great college,

1155
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:57,179
worked at private equity funds
and hedge funds,

1156
01:06:57,263 --> 01:07:01,183
it's impossible to avoid stimulants.

1157
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:02,268
Stimulant abuse.

1158
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:06,480
Because our definition of medication
has changed.

1159
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:09,775
It used to be getting over an illness

1160
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:15,531
versus taking advantage of a loophole
to acquire a Schedule II drug.

1161
01:07:15,614 --> 01:07:20,953
We had some friends who were on Adderall
for off-label uses

1162
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:24,331
and they weren't getting good results.

1163
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:26,876
They thought that they needed it
to be successful.

1164
01:07:26,959 --> 01:07:28,044
We didn't want that,

1165
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:32,965
so we started looking at alternatives
that were over the counter,

1166
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:38,137
without needing to go pretend
to have ADHD.

1167
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:42,349
I just got this vision
of a very simple page.

1168
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:43,726
Just three elements.

1169
01:07:43,809 --> 01:07:48,105
A question, a "Yes" button,
and "No, thank you, I'm satisfied."

1170
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:51,317
We can ask, "Do you want great sleep?"

1171
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,153
"Yes" or "No, thanks, I'm satisfied."

1172
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:57,782
If they hit "No," it moves on to,
"Do you want more focus?"

1173
01:07:57,865 --> 01:08:00,159
If they hit "Yes,"
they go straight to the OptiMind LP.

1174
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:04,538
How can I help you today?

1175
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:08,751
[man on speaker]
What if your brain could do more? It can.

1176
01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:13,380
Sometimes people put us in the same boat
as prescription stimulants,

1177
01:08:13,964 --> 01:08:15,758
and I hate that because we're not.

1178
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:19,345
We're meant to help healthy people
achieve their purpose.

1179
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:21,347
I don't have ADHD.

1180
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:27,061
I'm a healthy person looking for things
that can help make me

1181
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:32,191
the optimal and ultimate version of me
that I have in my mind.

1182
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:33,442
I think internally,

1183
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:37,696
everybody is looking for that
ultimate next version of themselves.

1184
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:42,326
We started AlternaScript
taking ingredients that had been studied

1185
01:08:42,409 --> 01:08:45,079
by the top neuroscience institutes
in the world,

1186
01:08:45,162 --> 01:08:46,997
and saying,
"Do any of these actually work?"

1187
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:49,542
And then things started to take off.

1188
01:08:51,043 --> 01:08:54,922
One day, all of a sudden,
we're on the front page of VICE News

1189
01:08:55,005 --> 01:08:58,634
about how cognitive enhancement pills
are going commercial.

1190
01:08:58,717 --> 01:09:00,094
This research is out there.

1191
01:09:00,177 --> 01:09:04,598
And now it's just up to entrepreneurs
to put it all together into something

1192
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:06,225
that people can take every day.

1193
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:09,687
[man on speaker]
The mind is a beautiful thing.

1194
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:10,771
Unleash yours.

1195
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:11,772
Matt, anything you'd add?

1196
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:14,817
You said excited and dedicated.

1197
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:18,863
I'd just do one more take
of that first phrase.

1198
01:09:18,946 --> 01:09:21,282
And maybe try picking one or the other

1199
01:09:21,365 --> 01:09:24,326
just to drive straight through
to the point.

1200
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,787
-What about excitacated?
-"Excitacated"?

1201
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:28,455
[laughing]

1202
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:31,333
-Sounds like a new prescription.
-[laughs]

1203
01:09:37,089 --> 01:09:40,050
Cognitive enhancement is not going away.

1204
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:43,596
It's the future of the human species.

1205
01:09:44,471 --> 01:09:46,015
All of this is inevitable.

1206
01:09:46,098 --> 01:09:48,934
The nootropics movement with microdosing,

1207
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:51,395
with using things like modafinil,

1208
01:09:51,478 --> 01:09:55,858
people are taking steps
to get to that next level,

1209
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:58,986
whether it's physically or cognitively.

1210
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:05,784
In parts of Silicon Valley now, people are
very interested in micro doses

1211
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:10,915
of LSD and psilocybin
for enhancement purposes.

1212
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:16,962
And in a culture in which
innovation is given such a high priority,

1213
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:19,506
I can imagine ways in which
that might play into

1214
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:23,385
the idea of having
a more expansive view of things

1215
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:26,472
at the same time that you can get
some of the benefits of focus.

1216
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,769
[Lily] It's not like a glass of wine
or a joint,

1217
01:10:31,852 --> 01:10:35,064
or any way that people use to decompress.

1218
01:10:35,147 --> 01:10:39,485
I really see it as a supplement,
as a tool.

1219
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,155
So I microdose every four days.

1220
01:10:43,989 --> 01:10:48,619
I grind the mushrooms into a powder,

1221
01:10:48,702 --> 01:10:51,330
and I put them in capsules

1222
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:55,376
that measure out to 0.2 grams.

1223
01:10:56,877 --> 01:11:00,005
Microdose is about a tenth to a twentieth

1224
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:04,134
of a conventional dose
of a psychedelic substance.

1225
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:06,387
That includes the classic psychedelics,

1226
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:11,600
LSD, psilocybin, mushrooms,
mescaline, peyote.

1227
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:15,312
You can expect zero psychedelic effects.

1228
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:17,731
The rocks don't glitter even a little,

1229
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:20,693
the flowers have no great interest
in you personally.

1230
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:25,239
In fact, if you have anything like that,
that's too high a dose.

1231
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:29,868
[Lily] In college,
I got Adderall from other kids.

1232
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:31,996
I didn't fill my own prescription.

1233
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:35,582
After college,
I felt this mounting pressure from work

1234
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:39,128
to start using my prescription again,

1235
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:42,298
and it was 90 milligrams a day.

1236
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:44,758
The mentality around here is
it should have been done yesterday,

1237
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:47,594
and move fast, break things.

1238
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:50,723
I hate that phrase,
but that's something everybody uses.

1239
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:53,058
You shouldn't be 28 and 29
and talking about

1240
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:55,602
significant burnout and breakdowns.

1241
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:01,817
Are there better, safer, simpler,

1242
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:07,072
less physiologically
disruptive substances,

1243
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:09,241
and that have better side effects?

1244
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:15,122
The substance has never any side effects.
They're all effects.

1245
01:12:15,205 --> 01:12:16,832
It's just which ones you wanna...

1246
01:12:16,915 --> 01:12:19,918
If you're selling,
you go for one set of effects.

1247
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:23,547
If you're looking at helping people
who are being tortured

1248
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:26,884
by their pharmaceutical,
you look at other effects.

1249
01:12:26,967 --> 01:12:28,927
[Lily] When you take Adderall,
there's a sense of urgency

1250
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:30,846
to get through things
as quickly as possible,

1251
01:12:30,929 --> 01:12:34,516
but this is, you're comfortable
with taking your time,

1252
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,895
and you realize that you can
take your time to execute properly.

1253
01:12:37,978 --> 01:12:42,483
The clue came to me some years ago,
where I learned that Albert Hofmann,

1254
01:12:42,566 --> 01:12:45,694
who was the man who first synthesized LSD

1255
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:50,783
said that this very low dose area
was incredibly under-researched.

1256
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:55,287
And he said, had Sandoz, his company,
been more active,

1257
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:57,623
there would have not been
a market for Ritalin.

1258
01:12:57,706 --> 01:13:00,834
[Lily] But instead, we have this
really highly addictive substance

1259
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:03,921
that is a moneymaker for companies
and doctors.

1260
01:13:04,004 --> 01:13:06,340
LSD and mushrooms aren't that.

1261
01:13:09,593 --> 01:13:10,677
[Eben whistles]

1262
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:14,932
When I count to four, you do it.
One, two, three, four.

1263
01:13:15,015 --> 01:13:16,767
[woman on TV] Starts now on Disney Junior.

1264
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:17,684
I got it.

1265
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:23,190
What? What was that face for?

1266
01:13:23,273 --> 01:13:28,737
I haven't had any urge to take Adderall
since my career ended, really.

1267
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:30,739
My mindset is totally different.

1268
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:36,912
I used to need that energy
and that mental chaos. [chuckles]

1269
01:13:37,871 --> 01:13:40,374
[woman on speaker] It's easy to forget
that on the most basic level,

1270
01:13:40,457 --> 01:13:44,503
we are alive and breathing.
We may have problems...

1271
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:46,797
[Eben] Now, meditation has
helped tremendously

1272
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:50,801
with my focus, my mental clarity.

1273
01:13:50,884 --> 01:13:55,139
So, of course, I have days where I'm like,
"Fuck, man. I was in the NFL."

1274
01:13:56,056 --> 01:13:59,059
As a rookie coming into the League,
people are telling you,

1275
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:01,186
"You're not gonna be
a football player forever.

1276
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:03,897
The NFL, it stands for 'Not For Long.'"

1277
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:08,193
But you're a 21-year-old kid
who's just realized his dream.

1278
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:11,280
All that shit's
going right over your fucking head.

1279
01:14:11,363 --> 01:14:14,366
I really took it as far as I could.

1280
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:15,701
I gave everything I had

1281
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:19,204
until the day came
when I just couldn't do it anymore.

1282
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:25,419
[Brit] The moment
Eben was ready to retire,

1283
01:14:25,502 --> 01:14:28,505
I said, "What are you going to write?
Start writing."

1284
01:14:28,589 --> 01:14:30,591
[exhales heavily]

1285
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:33,760
[Eben] Sometime in high school,

1286
01:14:33,844 --> 01:14:37,806
I fell in love with the idea
of becoming a writer.

1287
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:41,727
I started reading Bret Easton Ellis,
Less Than Zero.

1288
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:45,314
I just felt in my gut,
I was like, "Creative writing's for me."

1289
01:14:45,397 --> 01:14:49,318
So, as my career came to an end,

1290
01:14:49,401 --> 01:14:51,278
my wife really encouraged me

1291
01:14:51,361 --> 01:14:55,532
to take these stacks of journals I had

1292
01:14:55,616 --> 01:14:58,785
of writing from my experience
in the league.

1293
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:04,249
"Riding lightning, that's the best way
I can describe taking Adderall.

1294
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:07,669
I took two that Monday night
before kickoff."

1295
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:20,641
It's really exciting to be able to
be on the verge of figuring out

1296
01:15:20,724 --> 01:15:24,728
who am I gonna be in this life
after football.

1297
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:27,856
[cell phone ringing]

1298
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:31,944
-Hey, my baby.
-[Rahiem] Yes, Mother.

1299
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:35,822
Don't text me, "I'm at the game, Ma."
You answer the phone when I call you.

1300
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:38,158
I show him this picture all the time.

1301
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:42,746
I'm like, "See, this is what happens
when you don't take your medication."

1302
01:15:42,829 --> 01:15:46,708
He kept getting into physical altercations
with another student at the school,

1303
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:48,544
and Rahiem's nose got broken.

1304
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:52,297
I actually had to press charges
against the other kid.

1305
01:15:53,298 --> 01:15:58,220
And I felt like
I could no longer handle him,

1306
01:15:58,303 --> 01:16:02,307
so I allowed him
to go live with his father in New Jersey.

1307
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:08,230
That's his oldest brother. He's 18.

1308
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:13,443
There was plenty of incidents.
And the day he turned 15, he stole my car.

1309
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:16,029
[interviewer] To do what?

1310
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:18,073
He just stole my car.

1311
01:16:19,324 --> 01:16:22,619
I went to go look for my car,
and it was gone.

1312
01:16:22,703 --> 01:16:25,455
Parents are crying.
By the time they get to the doctor,

1313
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:27,958
they're crying, they're hurting.

1314
01:16:28,041 --> 01:16:29,668
They don't know what to do

1315
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:31,461
with these little people
when they act like that.

1316
01:16:32,045 --> 01:16:34,798
[Sherry] There's so much negativity
going around,

1317
01:16:34,881 --> 01:16:38,218
saying that if a kid does this too much,
if a kid does that too much,

1318
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:41,805
a doctor automatically wants to say
that they're ADD or ADHD

1319
01:16:41,888 --> 01:16:43,640
to just give them medication.

1320
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:47,185
Me being a parent
that actually has a child with it,

1321
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:51,773
and I can tell the difference
between Rahiem and my oldest son.

1322
01:16:52,357 --> 01:16:56,528
And as a parent, sometimes
it's disheartening because...

1323
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:03,327
you feel like you're not doing everything
that you can do for your kids.

1324
01:17:14,671 --> 01:17:16,715
I still try and encourage him from here.

1325
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:18,592
I ask him every day I talk to him,

1326
01:17:18,675 --> 01:17:22,638
"Did you take you take your meds?"
And he goes, "Yes, Mom, I took my meds."

1327
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:28,143
But... I'm hoping this is a good move.

1328
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:30,937
'Cause I'm missing him like crazy.
[chuckles]

1329
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:38,695
[Regina] I don't think he'd have gotten
through high school without Adderall.

1330
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:40,489
He would have gotten through,

1331
01:17:40,572 --> 01:17:42,574
but I can't say
that he would be where he is,

1332
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,451
to be honest, if he wasn't on it.

1333
01:17:44,534 --> 01:17:49,998
As much as I think he's very angry at me
for putting him on the Adderall,

1334
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:53,877
I think that he appreciates
me being the heavy,

1335
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:57,005
because if I wasn't, you know...

1336
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:00,300
where would we all be?

1337
01:18:04,805 --> 01:18:06,390
[Nathanael] I was very fortunate.

1338
01:18:06,473 --> 01:18:11,561
I started this process on New Year's,
2016, and said,

1339
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:15,107
"Erin," my girlfriend,
"I think I'm going to do a boot camp."

1340
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:20,112
And then I did all of the things
that I had to do

1341
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:22,322
to make that happen.

1342
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:24,282
One of those things
was getting on Adderall.

1343
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:29,287
I pretty much got everything I wanted.

1344
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:33,375
The pay's great,
and a recruiter from Google approached me.

1345
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:36,878
And that's crazy. For me, that's crazy.

1346
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:39,381
There's no way any of that
would have been possible

1347
01:18:39,464 --> 01:18:40,716
without the medication.

1348
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:44,344
That might be because
I have really severe ADHD,

1349
01:18:44,428 --> 01:18:47,764
and have a hard time
performing in the ways needed.

1350
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:51,435
It might be because it was jet fuel
and it got me where I needed to go.

1351
01:18:51,518 --> 01:18:53,812
I don't try to draw a line between those.

1352
01:18:55,939 --> 01:18:59,067
[interviewer] Have you tried
any of the stimulants yourself?

1353
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:02,904
One time, in that first Ritalin study.

1354
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:05,907
It was sort of late afternoon.

1355
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:11,079
I felt like it was
such an enhancement of my day.

1356
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:16,126
So, yes, you know,
it was a good experience,

1357
01:19:16,209 --> 01:19:21,631
and thank goodness I did not decide
to dip into that barrel ever again.

1358
01:19:26,511 --> 01:19:28,054
[interviewer] Did you get your grades
back already?

1359
01:19:28,138 --> 01:19:31,850
I got one grade back from the exam
I took this morning at 10:00.

1360
01:19:32,684 --> 01:19:34,186
And I got an A.

1361
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:37,939
The stress really
doesn't ever leave entirely.

1362
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:44,404
But I'm excited, once I graduate,
to be able to leave that at work.

1363
01:19:45,697 --> 01:19:47,491
I have a pretty good feeling

1364
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:50,076
that this will be the end
of my relationship with Adderall.

1365
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:54,498
Hopefully, in the adult world,
I'll manage my time well enough

1366
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:58,960
that there won't be a time where
I need to take prescription drugs,

1367
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:00,712
to get my work done.

1368
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:01,880
Hopefully, it's the end.

1369
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:05,467
I don't know where I will be,
but when I picture it,

1370
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:07,969
I don't picture myself taking Adderall.

1371
01:20:09,012 --> 01:20:11,807
[Blue] The purpose of Adderall for me
is to focus on work.

1372
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:14,935
If I can get to a place
where work is running itself

1373
01:20:15,018 --> 01:20:18,021
and things are okay, then I don't need it.

1374
01:20:18,104 --> 01:20:20,398
If I hit
for $200 million dollars tomorrow,

1375
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:21,942
I'd never take Adderall again.

1376
01:20:22,025 --> 01:20:23,985
But then I need my Adderall
to remember to play,

1377
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:27,030
'cause I keep forgetting
to play the lottery. [chuckles]

1378
01:20:29,282 --> 01:20:31,785
[Ariana] I'm just so much more boring
when I'm on my medication.

1379
01:20:31,868 --> 01:20:33,787
Also angrier.

1380
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:37,123
But yesterday, I had to study all day,
so I was on Vyvanse,

1381
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:39,709
and I took an Adderall,
and I was wired the whole time.

1382
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:42,879
[chuckles] Felt like shit,
but I got my work done.

1383
01:20:42,963 --> 01:20:46,049
So, it's just this balance
you have to figure out.

1384
01:20:50,428 --> 01:20:52,472
[Delaney] I'm just getting
a little disillusioned

1385
01:20:52,556 --> 01:20:54,683
with this higher education thing.

1386
01:20:54,766 --> 01:20:56,977
You need a bachelor's degree
to be anybody.

1387
01:20:57,060 --> 01:21:00,856
And we're all high on ADD meds
as a group of 20-something-year-olds

1388
01:21:00,939 --> 01:21:03,191
just fighting each other for...

1389
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:05,735
For what? To set the curve in a class?

1390
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:09,531
[Schwarz] What you have here is a dynamic

1391
01:21:09,614 --> 01:21:15,745
of not only people using what is
a dangerous drug,

1392
01:21:15,829 --> 01:21:17,831
particularly when used improperly.

1393
01:21:17,914 --> 01:21:21,459
But you also find
a bit of an arms race building up

1394
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:26,506
where if enough people see
that their competition is doing it,

1395
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:29,301
they feel like they kind of
have to do it, too.

1396
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:34,848
[Chatterjee] I think focusing on the use,
or abuse,

1397
01:21:34,931 --> 01:21:37,183
depending on how people feel about this,

1398
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:39,644
is symptomatic of something broader.

1399
01:21:40,812 --> 01:21:44,357
This highly competitive environment

1400
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:48,361
in which people feel compelled

1401
01:21:48,445 --> 01:21:52,032
to compete beyond their possibilities
to get ahead.

1402
01:21:53,533 --> 01:21:56,328
This kind of focus

1403
01:21:56,411 --> 01:22:01,166
on material progress and productivity...

1404
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:03,960
What's the cost of that?

1405
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:07,297
And is that a cost
we're willing to live with?

1406
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:11,760
[Sherry] I wouldn't say
that I'm happy to have Adderall,

1407
01:22:11,843 --> 01:22:15,347
but I'm happy that
Adderall is an option for him.

1408
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:20,477
[Jasper] After not being on it
all the time,

1409
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:24,522
I feel more comfortable with who I am,
with my body and stuff.

1410
01:22:27,567 --> 01:22:30,111
I would never put my kid
on Adderall, ever,

1411
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:32,238
'cause I know what it does to you,

1412
01:22:32,322 --> 01:22:34,741
and it's not fun being on it.

1413
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:36,868
I feel like it was too easy to put

1414
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:40,664
a kid on something close to meth
and not question it.

1415
01:22:41,581 --> 01:22:45,126
There's other things you can do.
Just teach him how to focus.

1416
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:53,426
It was about being the best.

1417
01:22:55,762 --> 01:23:02,727
The NFL is a symbol of that level, really.

1418
01:23:04,062 --> 01:23:08,900
[interviewer] Do you wish that
you had not taken that Ritalin?

1419
01:23:10,235 --> 01:23:11,403
[inhales deeply]

1420
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:15,115
No. I mean, I was doing what I had to do,

1421
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:20,537
and I'm happy to be on this
next chapter of my life.

1422
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:25,709
It's never so bad that
you can't climb out of the hole.

1423
01:23:27,877 --> 01:23:31,006
[Brown] Adderall, the drug of our time.

1424
01:23:31,923 --> 01:23:36,970
I suppose the question of what's lost
if we all were in an Adderall world,

1425
01:23:37,053 --> 01:23:40,223
is the question, "What is it all for?"

1426
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:45,145
I just lost my thought.
Hang on one second.

1427
01:23:45,228 --> 01:23:48,398
I had it. I had an example.

1428
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:56,031
What we also might say is lost
is what human beings do

1429
01:23:56,114 --> 01:24:00,493
when they muse and when they reflect

1430
01:24:01,327 --> 01:24:03,913
and when their thoughts wander.

1431
01:24:05,081 --> 01:24:06,458
I know what I'll do. Okay.

1432
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:10,003
And out of that comes, what?

1433
01:24:10,086 --> 01:24:13,048
Creativity, art,

1434
01:24:13,965 --> 01:24:17,302
extraordinary moments of human connection.

1435
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:23,641
Of course, also moments
of intense human pain and grief,

1436
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:29,522
but I would describe them
as the experience of being human itself.

1437
01:24:40,283 --> 01:24:42,285
