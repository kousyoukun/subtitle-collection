This is the most ridiculous bathroom.

45
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,077
Everyone has their initiation kit,

46
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,705
which reflects his personality.

I'm from New Jersey.
It's something I'm kidding about.

51
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,387
And a Jew smoking marijuana
with a menorah

52
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,848
This is my favorite.

53
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,727
Every time we go out, we bring something home.

54
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,940
When I started college,
my parents said:

55
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,608
"You need a safe."

56

And I asked: "Who is going to steal

60
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:18,741
They are worth gold.

64
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,208
and do not sell a little.

65
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,836
Here they are used
because it is a difficult university.

66
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,963
Many people use Adderall.

67
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:32,881
SENIOR

68
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,799
Why consume something like that?

69
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:35,717
There is trazodone.

70
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,761
Ativan, for panic attacks.

71
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,680
When I arrived here, I said to myself:

72
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:45,268
"Wow, everyone takes Adderall, everyone."

73
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,563
It's empty.

74

<i> I've seen people in class

"Does anyone have Adderall to sell?"

77
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,578
Sometimes I forget that it is illegal.

78
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,040
<i> There is a group on Facebook,

80
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:13,379
People publish there that sells
20 Adderall XR,

81
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:17,258
without thinking that they are trafficking
in a public forum.

82
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:26,059
My mom did not hide it, but I did.

83
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:32,148
You need Adderall and Instagram
to be the perfect student.

84
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:36,277
<i> You have to be slim and beautiful,
and have the best grades. </ i>

85
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,699
You also have to go out and have fun,
and the Adderall serves for that.

86
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,787
<i> There are instant effects
and of prolonged effect. </ i>

87

89
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:54,587

99

<i> Obviously, if you have access to something </ i>

00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,679
You will want to take advantage of it.

103
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:45,972
You will want to use it.

00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,326
Let's see. I have five subjects.

110
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:10,914
If I get 90 in the task
and 82 in today's test,

111
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:13,041
that gives 89.77.

112
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:16,336
It does not work for me, unless
that she round up.

113
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,087
I think it's going to be 83,

114
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,547
but it's because of pride.

115
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,134
I'd like to finish better than when I started.

126
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:58,378
where competition is not limited
to reach the goal.

127
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,213
Actually, it never ends.

138
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:46,426
in my opinion it is almost inexorably derived
in the consumption of Adderall,

139
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:52,140
either by recommendation
from the same parents or from a partner

140

<i> they used drugs as evasion. </ i>

144

Now they are used

145
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:06,279
And that says a lot
of our current culture.

146
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:09,991
What does that mean? Because it depresses me.

147
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,494
We have medicines for that.

148
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:16,623
I had friends who used Adderall
in secondary

149
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,667
And by using Adderall or Vyvanse,

"Fuck you, technophile."

Only in San Francisco does that happen.

323
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:49,779
Maybe they assumed

324
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:52,740
that when using an electric cycle,
I was a technophile.

I had

357
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,233
But during a workout,
I was doing squats

358
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:53,820
and when I went down, I felt something dripping.

359
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:56,906
As if they had squeezed

362
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:07,876
I resumed my workouts, and they said:

363
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:11,171
"Friend, what happened to you?"

364
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:16,634

and a colleague tells me: "I have Adderall".

370
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:42,368
I took the pills
and I felt my life returning.

I saw the corners.

377
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:03,556

It makes you feel more awake and alert.

380
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:12,315
And it also increases the euphoria.

381
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:14,400
They are very positive things.

382
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:16,736
That's why we drink caffeine in the morning.

383
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:20,406
<i> There are two basic types of stimulants. </ i>

384

<i> Amphetamine and methylphenidate. </ i>

385

<i> Amphetamine, on the other hand,
it is the basic component of Adderall. </ i>

388
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:41,761
All these medications
considered as stimulants

389
00:21:41,844 --> 00:21:44,430
they operate in the catecholamine system.

390
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,725
<i> This system consists of two parts. </ i>

391
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:52,272
<i> One is norepinephrine,

<i> as noradrenaline or adrenaline. </ i>

393
00:21:55,274 --> 00:21:57,110
<i> And the other one is dopamine. </ i>

394
00:21:57,192 --> 00:22:00,613
<i> What these drugs usually do
in the brain </ i>

395
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:05,493
<i> is to increase the release
of catecholamines </ i>

396
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:08,037
<i> or block its reabsorption. </ i>

397
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,373
<i> Increase the reaction time, </ i>

398
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:13,126
<i> may increase pain tolerance </ i>

399
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,295
<i> during an athletic competition. </ i>

400
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:19,007
<i> A low dose of amphetamine
or another similar drug </ i>

401
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:22,218
<i> can make a child or an adult </ i>

They will tend to stay

although this is not interesting.

405
00:22:31,602 --> 00:22:37,567
The Adderall had
a positive holistic effect

406
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:39,444
in my life, back then.

407
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:44,782
<i> He helped me in the meetings,
to analyze the games, the videos. </ i>

408
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:47,452
<i> It helped me deal with the pain. </ i>

409
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:51,623
That was what encouraged me to think:

410
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:55,502
"I must have access to this,

411
00:22:55,584 --> 00:23:00,340
and do it the right way
so as not to fail the doping tests.

412
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:01,508
I do not want that.

413
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,718
But it's something that can help me. "

414
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,013
<i> If you are a professional athlete

<i> You can not take stimulants

416

that you have a real case of ADHD

417
00:23:14,478 --> 00:23:17,398
and that stimulants are not
for performance,

418
00:23:17,481 --> 00:23:19,025

I was happy because it was obvious

421
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:29,661
then in the night

422
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:32,872
I did exactly what I wanted
to do.

423
00:23:32,955 --> 00:23:36,251
I took out the trash
and washed the dishes without delay.

424
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:40,880
I organized my DVD collection,
by director, alphabetically.

425
00:23:40,963 --> 00:23:44,592
I think I called my mom and said:

00:23:44,675 --> 00:23:45,885
"This is great.

427

434
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:19,669
I concentrated more on my distractions

435
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:22,172

440
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:39,480
I accepted the offer, and it really helped.

00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:48,716
<i> When I take Adderall,
I'm about to solve problems. </ i>

463
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,010
They show me a problem and I'll take care of it.

464
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:52,554
She said 175.

465
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:53,680
I'm going to tell you.

466
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:58,142
<i> I have had the fortune to work
with Outkast, CeeLo Green and Nick Cannon. </ i>

467
00:25:58,225 --> 00:26:00,144
<i> Lidias with different people. </ i>

468
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:01,604
Lidias with managers,

469
00:26:01,687 --> 00:26:03,731
stamps, accountants, agents.

470
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:07,110
When you take Adderall,
it's easier to remember others

471
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:09,487
and return the calls.

472
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,072
Hello Mario. Speak Blue.

473
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:13,783
If I do not take it,
It costs me to return calls.

474
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:15,994
Good representatives are
from New York.

475
00:26:17,286 --> 00:26:19,330
We will work on the presentation

476
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:21,958
<i> for the parties in the pools
of Wild 'n Out. </ i>

477
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,336
I'm making a deal
to share the sponsors

478
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:26,796
with the hotel.

479
00:26:26,879 --> 00:26:28,131
Is there a deadline?

480
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:32,552
Today is Monday. Wednesday would be ideal.

481
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:34,804
Puff would want it for Wednesday.

482
00:26:34,887 --> 00:26:37,891
When I come back from Chicago,
I want that space.

483
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:40,018
- With a cheesecake.
- Thank you.

484
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,479
ADULTS FORM MOST
OF THE POPULATION

485
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:46,399
WHAT IT TAKES PRESCRIPTION STIMULANTS

486
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:51,821
THEY ARE THE SEGMENT OF THE DRUG MARKET
TO TREAT ADHD THAT GROWS MORE

487
00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:58,495
In high school,
I had knowledge of the Adderall

488
00:26:58,577 --> 00:27:01,080
because it had been prescribed
To my brothers.

489
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:04,292
But nobody took it
to study or party.

490
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:07,795
It is very difficult,
despite the ethical problem,

491
00:27:07,878 --> 00:27:11,174
Know that it can be obtained easily.

492
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:13,968
You just ignore it.

493
00:27:14,051 --> 00:27:16,554
You agree to take lower notes

494
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:19,224
by not paying the two dollars per pill.

495
00:27:19,306 --> 00:27:23,269
Nor do you worry about being caught,

496
00:27:23,352 --> 00:27:26,189
since you are someone
with learning problems.

497
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:29,859
You are not a drug addict.
You did not buy it illegally.

498
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:31,569
I see that many

499
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:35,240
they are worried about having to buy
or sell illegal drugs.

500
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:39,244
It's like they're buying heroin.

501
00:27:39,326 --> 00:27:40,870
That they understand.

502
00:27:40,953 --> 00:27:42,831
But for people like one,

503
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:46,292
it does not make sense to worry
that the police catch you

504
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:48,795
or that the professor tells you,

505
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:52,257
because you just do not see it
like a drug.

506
00:27:54,842 --> 00:27:57,178
<i> I forgot to take the medicine. </ i>

507
00:27:57,261 --> 00:28:01,099
<i> But not the Adderall. It may be unfair. </ I>

508
00:28:01,181 --> 00:28:04,519
<i> I have a strange way
to think about it, </ i>

509
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:08,147
since she was surrounded by people
with much more money than me.

510
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,066
I had to work in high school,

511
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:13,403
<i> and I could not afford the private lessons. </ i>

512
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:17,073
On the one hand, the fact that someone like me

513
00:28:17,156 --> 00:28:22,495
take Adderall could do
the most balanced situation.

514
00:28:22,578 --> 00:28:25,623
But when it comes to someone
like the others,

515
00:28:25,706 --> 00:28:29,294
take it only puts them
in a more advantageous situation.

516
00:28:30,502 --> 00:28:34,883
<i> I'm from the Midwest, a place that has
problems with methamphetamines. </ i>

517
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:40,138
You see it in the news, the juxtaposition

518
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:43,141
<i> of the addict who lives in a trailer, </ i>

519
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:44,475
<i> as seen in DARE, </ i>

520
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:48,271
and the kids whose parents win
hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.

521
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:51,024
In a certain sense, both are drugged.

522
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:54,152
Opioid analgesics are
heroin in pills ...

523
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:55,904
PSYCHOTHERAPIST

524
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:58,281
and medicine for ADHD
It's methamphetamine.

525
00:28:58,363 --> 00:29:02,869
From the chemical point of view,
methamphetamine

526
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:07,081
<i> and amphetamine, the active component
of the Adderall, </ i>

527
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:10,001
<i> they only differ </ i>

528
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:14,130
<i> in the additional presence of the methyl group
in methamphetamine. </ i>

529
00:29:14,213 --> 00:29:17,258
Methamphetamine is legal in the US
With recipe.

530
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:20,803
<i> It's a Class II drug,
just like the Adderall. </ i>

531
00:29:20,886 --> 00:29:24,557
<i> But they do not prescribe it much
due to collective hysteria </ i>

532
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,017
<i> about the illegal way. </ i>

533
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:27,352
<i> We have an order. </ i>

534
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:30,688
They said that the "goal" was going to help me
with the exams.

535
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,067
MINTIERON

536
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:36,945
We think of those who have laboratories

537
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:40,365
and in those who live in rural areas
from the USA

538
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:42,659
From a negative perspective.

539
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:45,453
But on the other hand,
we have an amphetamine

540
00:29:45,536 --> 00:29:46,704
<i> with similar effect. </ i>

541
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:49,165
Girls, to take the Adderall.

542
00:29:49,873 --> 00:29:52,585
What time did you come back last night?

543
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:53,670
Late.

544
00:29:53,752 --> 00:29:56,130
And we see that from another perspective.

545
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:58,842
<i> When they talk to us about people
what Adderall takes, </ i>

546
00:29:58,924 --> 00:30:00,468
<i> we think of students, </ i>

547
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:03,012
<i> we think of people that we like. </ i>

548
00:30:03,095 --> 00:30:07,267
I took six Adderall pills
accidentally.

549
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:08,434
I did not sleep at all

550
00:30:08,517 --> 00:30:12,438
and I immersed myself in the Facebook page
by Dilon Davidson.

551
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:13,356
I found something.

552
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:17,735
The wealthy young people have access
to pharmacy amphetamine,

553
00:30:17,818 --> 00:30:22,240
while others consume methamphetamine
processed on the street.

554
00:30:22,322 --> 00:30:28,037
While the "goal" in crystals or smoked
it's more powerful,

555
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,832
the effect on neuroreceptors is the same.

556
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,420
<i> I'm surrounded by privileged people, </ i>

557
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:38,298
<i> of the wealthy people of the USA. </ i>

558
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,049
<i> We have money for tests </ i>

559
00:30:40,132 --> 00:30:42,886
and resources to be medicated

560
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:46,181
<i> and thus improve performance. </ i>

561
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:51,060
Draw the health system
and find the right doctors

562
00:30:51,143 --> 00:30:53,479
It is also a matter of money.

563
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:56,566
Many know how to do it and others do not.

564
00:30:56,648 --> 00:30:59,736
If you have the contacts,
If you know who to see,

565
00:30:59,818 --> 00:31:02,238
everything becomes easier.

566
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,787
The Adderall is perfect for working
in finance or in another job ...

567
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,372
FINANCIAL ANALYST

568
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:13,416
that requires to be retailer,

569
00:31:13,499 --> 00:31:15,418
Well, that's the way finances are.

570
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:17,003
<i> When I was at Goldman, </ i>

571
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:21,299
<i> I never told anyone

572
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:25,470
<i> You had to think hard
before revealing that you were taking Adderall. </ i>

573
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:29,516
<i> I think many fear that by revealing it, </ i>

574

<i> There is a great phrase
from the comedy Silicon Valley, </ i>

588
00:32:23,944 --> 00:32:28,366
where one of the employees needed
Adderall and could not get,

589
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:30,910
and they say: "Go out on the street by bicycle.

590
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:33,496
Many children in Palo Alto take it. "

591
00:32:33,579 --> 00:32:34,664
Hi.

592
00:32:36,582 --> 00:32:39,836
Do any of you take Adderall

593
00:32:39,918 --> 00:32:43,631
and want to earn $ 50?

594
00:32:43,714 --> 00:32:46,134
This is the generation that since the 90s

595
00:32:46,216 --> 00:32:50,847
has been exposed to consumption
of Adderall, Ritalin and Concerta,

596
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:51,931
between friends

597
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:54,809
<i> Scribbled in my notebook
I never did homework </ i>

598
00:32:54,892 --> 00:32:56,853
<i> Little attention
Adderall is the best </ i>

599
00:32:56,935 --> 00:33:00,607
I'm not a doctor, but Ritalin drugs you.

600
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:03,151
Maybe that's it. It is a new drug.

601
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:04,611
<i> It's a new drug. </ i>

602
00:33:04,693 --> 00:33:06,404
I have to expel your son.

603
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:10,408
Unless they are willing
to try a risky ...

604
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:13,786
- Chocolate bar?
- No. A drug called Focusyn.

605
00:33:13,869 --> 00:33:15,330
A drug?

606
00:33:16,997 --> 00:33:20,168
<i> I learned about ADD after being medicated, </ i>

607
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,879
so I never knew what it was like

608
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:24,464
It was for school.

609
00:33:25,047 --> 00:33:28,968
<i> It was to make your job easier
to the teachers </ i>

610

<i> and my parents,
and to stop being scandalous. </ i>

611
00:33:32,763 --> 00:33:34,974
And I guess to concentrate.

612
00:33:35,057 --> 00:33:37,852
However, I was never interested in school.

613
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:40,688
And I concentrated only on what I wanted.

614
00:33:40,771 --> 00:33:44,150
In my case, art.

615
00:33:44,233 --> 00:33:47,862
And read when I could,
which took time.

616
00:33:50,364 --> 00:33:53,952
Let's see. How is everything?
How is art?

617
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:57,205
All right. I have to prepare an exhibition
for this year.

618
00:33:57,287 --> 00:34:00,083
So I'm going to be very busy.

619
00:34:00,165 --> 00:34:01,501
- And the medicines?
- All right.

620
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:02,583
Do you take them?

621
00:34:02,626 --> 00:34:04,295
Yes but not so much.

622
00:34:04,378 --> 00:34:07,131
All right. Then sporadically,
like before.

623
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:10,260
Yes, and I would like
Stop taking them soon.

624
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:12,804
- In agreement.
- Leave them completely.

625
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:15,932
This has to do
with the development of the brain.

626
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:17,559
And as you grow up,

627
00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:21,145
the mature brain
and the neurons make their connections.

628
00:34:21,228 --> 00:34:22,313
It will not be necessary anymore.

629
00:34:22,396 --> 00:34:25,650
- Yes, I would not need it anymore.
- Let's see.

630
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,571
- I've taken them since the third grade.
- Yes

631
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:34,534
Do I make these tomatoes pure?

632
00:34:34,616 --> 00:34:35,743
If I help you?

633
00:34:35,826 --> 00:34:36,953
Yes. With your hands?

634
00:34:37,035 --> 00:34:40,081
Yes, do it with your hands.

635
00:34:40,664 --> 00:34:41,749
You do well.

636
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:46,171
Carefully.

637
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:49,716
<i> I studied at Montessori
when I was younger, </ i>

638
00:34:49,798 --> 00:34:51,467
<i> with my sister and my cousins. </ i>

639
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,803
Can you cut slices? I will do this.

640
00:34:53,886 --> 00:34:54,721
Clear.

641
00:34:54,803 --> 00:34:57,056
They did well. Not me.

642
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:01,561
As a child, everyone knew the alphabet
and the numbers.

643
00:35:01,685 --> 00:35:02,770
MOTHER OF JASPER

644
00:35:02,853 --> 00:35:06,357
But he did not differentiate
the numbers of the letters.

645
00:35:07,024 --> 00:35:08,234
- Sorry.
- Quiet.

646
00:35:08,317 --> 00:35:11,905
We asked to be examined,
and they said he had ADD.

647
00:35:11,987 --> 00:35:13,156
FATHER OF JASPER

648
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:16,743
We changed it to another school that was ...

649
00:35:16,825 --> 00:35:18,828
A very good school.

650
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,624
<i> Your third grade teacher </ i>

651
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:25,793
He told us something about some medications.

652
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:29,088
I said, "Well, he does not take anything."

653
00:35:29,171 --> 00:35:32,050
She answered:
"Everyone in this class takes something."

654
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:33,635
"Well, he does not," I said.

655
00:35:33,717 --> 00:35:37,388
She answered:
"Then you should try."

656
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:41,184
After two years there,
I was prescribed Adderall.

657
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:43,811
THE AMOUNT OF CHILDREN THAT TAKE STIMULANTS

658
00:35:43,894 --> 00:35:46,898
IT HAS RISEN NOTABLELY
IN THE LAST DECADES

659
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,151
IN 1990, 600 THOUSAND CHILDREN
TOMABAN STIMULANTS

660
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:53,530
FOR 2011, IT HAD RAISED TO 3.5 MILLION

661
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:58,451
A THIRD OF CHILDREN WITH ADHD
IT WAS DIAGNOSED BEFORE THE 6 YEARS

662
00:35:58,534 --> 00:36:00,119
<i> It was a difficult decision </ i>

663
00:36:00,202 --> 00:36:03,373
because I thought it was going to affect
your creativity

664
00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:07,794
<i> Already since the age of three,
It was obvious that he had a talent. </ i>

665
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:09,254
And I did not want to ruin it.

666
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:13,800
<i> We tried, and the difference was noticed in him. </ i>

667
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:16,886
<i> Now he could concentrate more. </ i>

668
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:19,806
I tried it too,
I wanted to see the effect.

669
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:23,017
Apparently, I also had ADHD,
because it worked.

670
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,021
It only helps you concentrate.

671
00:36:27,104 --> 00:36:28,940
Do you think I have ADD or ...?

672
00:36:29,022 --> 00:36:32,402
We will not know until we see
if Ritalin helps you concentrate.

673
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:37,073
<i> Not long ago, the medical guild thought: </ i>

674
00:36:37,156 --> 00:36:39,868
"I'm not sure
that this girl has ADHD.

675
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:43,621
There is no conclusive proof.
I'm going to prescribe a stimulant.

676
00:36:43,704 --> 00:36:46,749
If it works, you have ADHD.
If not, then it does not have ".

677
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:48,918
An interesting idea, but wrong.

678
00:36:49,001 --> 00:36:53,256
<i> Almost everyone who takes stimulants
You can concentrate better. </ i>

679
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:54,883
<i> and work through the night. </ i>

680
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:56,551
I had to take pills.

681
00:36:56,633 --> 00:37:00,221
I do not do it for fun.

682
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:01,806
I do it because I must.

683
00:37:02,764 --> 00:37:05,977
<i> When I was in ninth grade,
I was taking 50 mg a day. </ i>

684
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:09,397
I was coming home still feeling the effects.

685
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,566
<i> I went to bed at 6:00 a.m., </ i>

686
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:16,571
<i> after having been painting
all night, thanks to the effect. </ i>

687
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:21,326
The only difference between children and adults

688
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:25,955
is that children do not like to use
high doses of the medication.

689
00:37:26,038 --> 00:37:30,752
When raising the dose, they say:
"I feel nervous, I feel strange."

690
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:34,923
Something happens in the middle of adolescence
that brings young people

691
00:37:35,005 --> 00:37:39,052
and the adults to say:
"I feel big and powerful."

692
00:37:39,635 --> 00:37:41,596
<i> I felt very embarrassed. </ i>

693
00:37:41,678 --> 00:37:43,389
<i> In public school, </ i>

694
00:37:43,472 --> 00:37:45,475
He said: "Yes, I take medication."

695
00:37:45,557 --> 00:37:50,438
It seemed funny to me to say that I had
than taking pills to calm me down

696
00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:52,899
I always shouted at him:

697
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:55,318
<i> "Did you take your pills?". </ i>

698
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:00,156
<i> If he did not pay attention to me or if he behaved badly, </ i>

699
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:03,243
I asked him the question. Maybe that's why

700
00:38:03,325 --> 00:38:05,829
He used that annoyance as inspiration.

701
00:38:06,495 --> 00:38:08,498
JASPER DID NOT TAKE HIS PILLS

702
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,291
TAKE YOUR TABLETS

703
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:13,086
TAKE YOUR TABLETS

704
00:38:13,168 --> 00:38:16,673
<i> I started writing things like:
"Take your pills." </ I>

705
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:18,049
<i> I tried to force myself </ i>

706
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:22,053
to feel proud of the fact
to concentrate on something

707
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:24,138
and be able to ignore everything else.

708
00:38:24,221 --> 00:38:25,223
I felt pride.

709
00:38:28,892 --> 00:38:30,603
<i> Getting up was the obsession. </ i>

710
00:38:30,686 --> 00:38:34,482
Go out with other people and say:
"That's me".

711
00:38:36,066 --> 00:38:38,528
<i> They are beautiful. I love what he does. </ I>

712
00:38:39,444 --> 00:38:43,533
<i> The paintings do not match
with the idea of ​​using Adderall, </ i>

713
00:38:43,615 --> 00:38:46,911
<i> except for the fact
that they are very meticulous </ i>

714
00:38:46,994 --> 00:38:49,164
and I repeat them again and again.

715
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:53,501
It is the bond that I perceive between them
and the Adderall,

716
00:38:53,584 --> 00:38:55,670
<i> Obsessiveness. </ i>

717
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,886
<i> Everyone, for some reason, says: </ i>

718
00:39:02,968 --> 00:39:04,762
"We all have some ADHD."

719
00:39:04,845 --> 00:39:07,807
That is not true.
There are distractions in life,

720
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:11,686
but we do not all have the brain
of someone with ADHD.

721
00:39:13,145 --> 00:39:16,357
<i> One of my first memories
is to be diagnosed. </ i>

722
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:21,112
<i> I do not think it's positive that people say
things like that, </ i>

723
00:39:21,195 --> 00:39:24,449
because it reduces legitimacy.

724
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:30,538
It takes legitimacy from the effort

725
00:39:30,621 --> 00:39:33,708
and to the power that ADHD
I could have someone.

726
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,668
<i> It's a disorder. </ i>

727
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:39,130
It causes many problems
and generates a stigma.

728
00:39:39,213 --> 00:39:42,133
I think people downplay it,

729
00:39:42,216 --> 00:39:45,553
as if it were nothing and everyone had
a little, but it's not like that.

730
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:52,435
<i> Many people think they have it
because you can not concentrate. </ i>

731
00:39:52,518 --> 00:39:56,689
But you can not concentrate
because society does not teach us how.

732
00:39:56,772 --> 00:39:58,566
It's the minute society.

733
00:39:58,649 --> 00:40:01,319
Everything requires a less prolonged approach.

734
00:40:03,821 --> 00:40:07,575
Society in general has ADD.

735
00:40:07,658 --> 00:40:11,871
Where is the border then?
among those born with the disorder

736
00:40:11,954 --> 00:40:14,749
and those who have grown
in a partnership with ADD?

737
00:40:14,832 --> 00:40:17,502
We are at that point.

738
00:40:17,584 --> 00:40:19,838
I walk away from the pool in the session.

739
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,756
It seems to Nick that it costs him.

740
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,424
A difficult work day

741
00:40:23,507 --> 00:40:25,260
What a hard life.

742
00:40:25,342 --> 00:40:28,221
I did not think to take drugs
when I went to the doctor.

743
00:40:28,303 --> 00:40:32,058
I knew I had ADHD symptoms.

744
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,977
I saw it in Russell Simmons.

745
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:36,855
And I placed myself within the spectrum.

746
00:40:37,813 --> 00:40:39,524
<i> I spoke with Russell twice. </ i>

747
00:40:39,606 --> 00:40:42,694
<i> And he told me: "I do not take medication.
I do yoga. "</ I>

748
00:40:42,776 --> 00:40:43,778
I did yoga with him.

749
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:48,533
And I thought: "I do not think this serves me."

750
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:50,118
Ready.

751
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,454
<i> We never talked about his TDA
when I was a child. </ i>

752
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:54,747
MOTHER OF BLUE

753
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,875
For me it did not require a label.

754
00:40:56,957 --> 00:41:01,296
For me, he had to learn to develop
the ability to deal with it.

755
00:41:01,378 --> 00:41:04,507
He never took me to the doctor
so they can medicate me

756
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:07,969
She wanted me to learn to function

757
00:41:08,051 --> 00:41:10,680
<i> within what I was going to be as a person. </ i>

758
00:41:10,762 --> 00:41:14,726
Rays, did I come back in the shot?
It was my fault.

759
00:41:14,808 --> 00:41:16,811
As a special education teacher,

760
00:41:17,895 --> 00:41:19,939
I've seen

761
00:41:20,022 --> 00:41:25,278
how they prescribe drugs in a systematic way
to children of color.

762
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:29,032
Seeing that, I did not want ...

763
00:41:29,114 --> 00:41:31,409
I have to add Hispanic children too.

764
00:41:31,492 --> 00:41:33,912
I did not want that for my son.

765
00:41:33,994 --> 00:41:37,624
<i> I was not happy when he told me, </ i>

766
00:41:37,706 --> 00:41:40,585
after so many years without medication,

767
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:42,921
I needed her.

768
00:41:43,003 --> 00:41:47,050
As a child, I believed that Ritalin was
for crazy kids.

769
00:41:47,132 --> 00:41:49,552
I did not know that I technically needed it.

770
00:41:49,635 --> 00:41:53,389
Everyone used Ritalin
as an instant cure.

771
00:41:53,472 --> 00:41:57,185
For me, it was not an instant cure.
That's why I did not like it.

772
00:41:57,851 --> 00:41:59,812
I just started it running a lot.

773
00:42:01,021 --> 00:42:02,690
Ritalin is due to love.

774
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:08,112
<i> A scientist in Switzerland was playing
with certain compounds </ i>

778
00:42:19,414 --> 00:42:21,376
He thought: "This kind of thing does work."

779
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:25,171
Her name was Marguerite,
but they said Rita.

780
00:42:25,254 --> 00:42:27,757
Hence the name Ritaline.

781
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:32,679
When the Swiss company Ciba
he put it on the market,

782
00:42:32,761 --> 00:42:37,475
they removed the "E" at the end
and it was renamed Ritalin.

783

00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,990
I LEAD THE FIRST STUDY ON RITALIN

788
00:42:52,072 --> 00:42:54,117
<i> It was most rewarding </ i>

789
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:58,705
that a father came the next day

790
00:42:58,787 --> 00:43:01,583
and said: "I can not believe it.

791
00:43:01,665 --> 00:43:03,710

<i> They really made a difference
in mental health. </ i>

801
00:43:33,447 --> 00:43:36,284
Doctors at Johns Hopkins

802
00:43:36,366 --> 00:43:39,454
they wanted to find out if there was another pill,

803
00:43:39,536 --> 00:43:42,123
apart from amphetamine,
of bad reputation,

804

<i> that I could help these children. </ i>

805
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:47,462
But how were they going to get methylphenidate?

806
00:43:47,544 --> 00:43:50,173
The only way was with those who sold it,

807
00:43:50,255 --> 00:43:51,758
the Swiss company Ciba.

808
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:55,011
They said: "Ciba, do you give us
a million pills? "

809
00:43:55,093 --> 00:44:00,975
They sent a full barrel
of Ritalin pills

810
00:44:01,058 --> 00:44:04,604
<i> to Johns Hopkins to do
the tests. </ i>

<i> We organize a study on the site </ i>

Hyperactivity and lack of attention
In the kids

821
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:45,854
They have known each other for a long time.

822
00:44:45,936 --> 00:44:48,189
That's how some children are.

823
00:44:48,272 --> 00:44:51,526
<i> One of the first names
it was minimal brain damage. </ i>

congenital or by encephalitis.

826
00:44:57,614 --> 00:45:01,119
But then they saw that that was not the case.

827
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:05,290
They proposed: "How are you?
minimal brain dysfunction? "

828
00:45:06,123 --> 00:45:10,211
It was not until 1980
when they started to notice

829
00:45:10,294 --> 00:45:13,882
in the concept of lack of attention
In the kids.

830
00:45:13,964 --> 00:45:17,886
<i> They proposed "disorder

831
00:45:17,968 --> 00:45:22,640

<i> and to allow as a cause to be medicated. </ i>

THE CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF STIMULANTS
EXCEEDS THE PEAK LEVELS OF THE SIXTY

839
00:45:51,376 --> 00:45:56,216
The original name
of the Adderall was Obetrol.

840
00:45:57,257 --> 00:46:02,472
<i> A pharmaceutical entrepreneur saw
who were using the Obetrol </ i>

841

<i> for what was known as ADD in English, </ i>

A BUSINESS OF 13 BILLION DOLLARS

One of the interesting phenomena

847
00:46:28,372 --> 00:46:29,624

that in the end trivializes the whole process,

852
00:46:44,721 --> 00:46:49,394

of the doctor and the pharmaceutical industry.

853

Do you consider that it is

Or was it at some point?

855
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:56,860
I think I was in the ADHD business,

in which he was involved.

There is a lot of money for doctors

and then you stopped doing it?

928
00:50:26,652 --> 00:50:27,654
Yes.

929
00:50:27,736 --> 00:50:31,032
Friend, it can not be.

930
00:50:31,114 --> 00:50:34,077
When they started it again, did they start
the headaches?

931
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:35,537
- Yes
- Very well.

932
00:50:35,619 --> 00:50:37,080
You have to tell me.

933
00:50:37,162 --> 00:50:40,458
The first medicines I did not like.

934
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:43,628
<i> He did not talk, did not eat or sleep. </ i>

935
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:46,756
In itself, it does not talk much.
We got you Adderall.

936
00:50:46,839 --> 00:50:50,176
When I started school, I took it daily

937
00:50:50,259 --> 00:50:53,638
and he had an average of 2.53.

938
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,057
But now it's going down,

939
00:50:57,266 --> 00:50:59,060
for not taking medicine.

940
00:50:59,142 --> 00:51:01,563
At his age, I'm not going to force him.

941
00:51:01,645 --> 00:51:04,482
He knows the difference
and he's already in high school.

942
00:51:04,565 --> 00:51:08,153
He decides if he wants to deal
with the consequences.

943
00:51:09,236 --> 00:51:12,031
However, I do not like them either
the effects.

944
00:51:13,824 --> 00:51:14,909
They can go.

945
00:51:17,035 --> 00:51:19,455
If a child has ADHD,

946
00:51:19,538 --> 00:51:22,333
We do our best to take it
to another level.

947
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:25,962
Whether with medication or therapy
or something else.

948
00:51:26,044 --> 00:51:27,255
Something must happen.

949
00:51:27,337 --> 00:51:30,425
<i> I was the first of my family
to graduate from high school. </ i>

950
00:51:30,507 --> 00:51:33,303
<i> I always tell my children:
"Do not be like me. </ I>

951
00:51:33,385 --> 00:51:34,554
<i> Be better. </ i>

952
00:51:34,636 --> 00:51:38,850
Since I have a master's degree,
then they must obtain a PhD,

953
00:51:38,932 --> 00:51:40,435
to tell you Dr. King. "

954
00:51:41,518 --> 00:51:43,146
There is.

955
00:51:46,148 --> 00:51:47,525
This is my son.

956
00:51:49,276 --> 00:51:51,154
<i> When you do not take the medication, </ i>

957
00:51:51,236 --> 00:51:55,450
<i> reacts without thinking
and it does not measure the consequences. </ i>

958
00:51:55,532 --> 00:51:57,911
He knows he should take it,

959
00:51:57,993 --> 00:52:00,163
but he does not like the effects.

960
00:52:00,245 --> 00:52:02,624
<i> Stop taking it between Friday and Sunday. </ i>

961
00:52:02,706 --> 00:52:05,835
If you take it on Monday, that makes it slow,

962
00:52:05,918 --> 00:52:07,670
as if he were a zombie.

963
00:52:07,753 --> 00:52:11,883
<i> Many of your friends do not deal with that. </ i>

964
00:52:11,965 --> 00:52:14,802
<i> And that makes you not feel normal. </ i>

965
00:52:14,885 --> 00:52:17,889
That's why he prefers not to take it.

966
00:52:23,769 --> 00:52:26,564
<i> What did you research about the Adderall? </ i>

967
00:52:26,647 --> 00:52:30,151
<i> We went to the doctor, we tried a medicine
and it did not work. </ i>

968
00:52:30,234 --> 00:52:33,613
Then we try this
and we noticed the difference immediately.

969
00:52:34,905 --> 00:52:36,074
Come on in.

970
00:52:37,032 --> 00:52:38,535
<i> Did I investigate something? </ i>

971
00:52:39,117 --> 00:52:40,578
Unfortunately not.

972
00:52:42,663 --> 00:52:44,624
<i> But he acted under the guidance of ... </ i>

973
00:52:45,541 --> 00:52:49,921
The psychologist and his pediatrician.

974
00:52:50,003 --> 00:52:52,131
The teachers of the school.

975
00:52:52,798 --> 00:52:55,343
My sister, who gave Ritalin to her son.

976
00:52:55,926 --> 00:52:59,764
I do not know if I would have done it today.
Now I'm looking for how to open a can.

977
00:52:59,847 --> 00:53:01,099
I investigate everything.

978
00:53:01,181 --> 00:53:06,104
But back then,
I think it would not have occurred to me.

979
00:53:09,439 --> 00:53:11,442
<i> Now I do not take it that much. </ i>

980
00:53:11,525 --> 00:53:13,528
<i> Only when I write. </ i>

981
00:53:14,153 --> 00:53:16,739
<i> It's not marijuana or alcohol. </ i>

982
00:53:16,822 --> 00:53:19,576
It's methamphetamine. It affects your liver.

983
00:53:19,658 --> 00:53:22,871
<i> During my last year,
I was not allowed to drink, </ i>

984
00:53:22,953 --> 00:53:25,415
<i> for fear he would fail. </ i>

985
00:53:25,497 --> 00:53:29,252
<i> Blood tests were not good.
Too many enzymes. </ I>

986
00:53:29,334 --> 00:53:32,297
<i> I had to check the color of the stool. </ i>

987
00:53:32,379 --> 00:53:34,841
If so, it's not worth it.

988
00:53:37,426 --> 00:53:41,431
How safe are these stimulants?

989
00:53:41,513 --> 00:53:44,392
There are cardiovascular risks.

990
00:53:44,474 --> 00:53:47,604
And risk of psychotic disorders.

991
00:53:47,686 --> 00:53:51,274
Even in those who do not have
history of psychosis

992
00:53:51,356 --> 00:53:56,029
There is a risk of long-term addiction.

993
00:53:56,111 --> 00:53:59,532
These drugs can cause dependence,

994
00:53:59,615 --> 00:54:03,077
and that is a terrible situation.

995
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,330
You do not want that or your enemy.

996
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:08,625
<i> One way or another, </ i>

997
00:54:08,707 --> 00:54:11,586
<i> wait for one to take Adderall. </ i>

998
00:54:12,544 --> 00:54:15,840
<i> The perfect employee
in investment banking </ i>

999
00:54:15,923 --> 00:54:20,386
<i> or in a technology company
He is the one who never says no. </ i>

1000
00:54:24,515 --> 00:54:30,772
<i> There is a culture that forces you
to work 16 hours, seven days in a row. </ i>

1001
00:54:31,396 --> 00:54:35,860
<i> If those around you can produce
these results, </ i>

1002
00:54:35,943 --> 00:54:37,612
<i> you should also be able to. </ i>

1003
00:54:38,487 --> 00:54:40,907
<i> But if they're taking Adderall, </ i>

1004
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:43,076
<i> then you should also do it. </ i>

1005
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:52,210
<i> I had had a few hard weeks
at work. </ i>

1006
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:55,129
<i> I worked with someone difficult
from Wall Street, </ i>

1007
00:54:55,212 --> 00:54:59,259
<i> that he had me and another analyst
working all day. </ i>

1008
00:54:59,341 --> 00:55:02,846
<i> We stayed two and a half days
awake with Adderall. </ i>

1009
00:55:04,721 --> 00:55:09,060
<i> We introduce you to the main manager
what we had done, </ i>

1010
00:55:09,142 --> 00:55:13,773
<i> He checked it and started saying: </ i>

1011
00:55:13,856 --> 00:55:18,111
<i> "This was not what I asked for.
I need this, this and this. "</ I>

1012
00:55:18,193 --> 00:55:22,240
<i> Being under the effects
of the medication I said: </ i>

1013
00:55:22,322 --> 00:55:25,869
"Fuck you, it's what you asked"

1014
00:55:27,035 --> 00:55:31,875
<i> The next day, I went back to the office
keeping a low profile, </ i>

1015
00:55:31,957 --> 00:55:34,794
<i> and a colleague comes up and says: </ i>

1016
00:55:34,877 --> 00:55:37,088
<i> "Did not you know what happened last night? </ i>

1017
00:55:37,171 --> 00:55:39,924
<i> Two or three hours after you left, </ i>

1018
00:55:40,007 --> 00:55:45,180
<i> the other analyst gave him a seizure
due to fatigue, </ i>

1019
00:55:45,846 --> 00:55:47,265
<i> and he's hospitalized. "</ i>

1020
00:55:48,432 --> 00:55:50,059
<i> I immediately called him. </ i>

1021
00:55:50,142 --> 00:55:53,730
<i> He answered the phone,
and I asked him how he was. </ i>

1022
00:55:53,812 --> 00:55:55,857
<i> "My parents want me to resign. </ i>

1023
00:55:55,939 --> 00:55:59,152
<i> They say enough is enough. </ i>

1024
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:02,489
<i> Can you send me this file?
They're asking me for it. "</ I>

1025
00:56:08,952 --> 00:56:10,955
<i> In high school I was told: </ i>

1026
00:56:11,038 --> 00:56:12,207
<i> "At the university </ i>

1027
00:56:12,289 --> 00:56:14,459
<i> you will see the subjects that you like ". </ i>

1028
00:56:15,334 --> 00:56:18,671
<i> I like administration, but it does not fill me. </ i>

1029
00:56:18,754 --> 00:56:21,090
<i> I'm wearing it because it's relevant. </ i>

1030
00:56:21,882 --> 00:56:26,012
The benefits of stimulants
They look long before the damage.

1031
00:56:26,803 --> 00:56:28,890
<i> The pilots of war took them. </ i>

1032
00:56:28,972 --> 00:56:31,100
They give you what you're looking for in the short term,

1033
00:56:31,183 --> 00:56:35,271
and they make you expect the same result
with the next pill.

1034
00:56:36,021 --> 00:56:37,857
<i> "The drug helped me study </ i>

1035
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,776
<i> and I got better grades. </ i>

1036
00:56:39,858 --> 00:56:41,110
I will do it again. "

1037
00:56:41,193 --> 00:56:44,572
Then: "I can not sleep.
Does anyone have anything for that? "

1038
00:56:44,655 --> 00:56:47,450
<i> Stimulants can be abused. </ i>

1039
00:56:47,533 --> 00:56:48,368
<i> Young people </ i>

1040
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:51,246
<i> in many cases they use them as a drug, </ i>

1041
00:56:51,328 --> 00:56:54,499
and combine them with a sedative,
like alcohol.

1042
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:57,544
<i> It is easy to abuse alcohol
if you take stimulants, </ i>

1043
00:56:57,626 --> 00:56:59,671
because you can take more,

1044
00:56:59,753 --> 00:57:02,006
but when it ceases, you are unconscious.

1045
00:57:02,089 --> 00:57:05,426
People use it to work,
and they think it's okay.

1046
00:57:06,134 --> 00:57:08,221
<i> I have friends who have arrived </ i>

1047
00:57:08,303 --> 00:57:11,891
<i> to the point that they can not work
without taking Adderall. </ i>

1048
00:57:11,974 --> 00:57:15,436
You get used to it,
and then you can not work without taking it.

1049
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:18,064
You can not be productive. I have seen it.

1050
00:57:18,147 --> 00:57:22,402
Many people can not take amphetamine
without becoming addicted.

1051
00:57:22,484 --> 00:57:26,614
There are too many people
who has become addicted,

1052
00:57:26,697 --> 00:57:32,453
and it is unacceptable that society
put so much amphetamine on the street.

1053
00:57:32,536 --> 00:57:36,166
We are in one of those ascending stages.

1054
00:57:36,248 --> 00:57:41,087
Those of us in the front notice it
for eight or ten years.

1055
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:43,464
At present,

1056
00:57:43,547 --> 00:57:47,468
the epidemic of prescription opioids
it's on the front page,

1057
00:57:47,551 --> 00:57:50,722
but the Adderall is right below

1058
00:57:50,804 --> 00:57:54,100
of the threshold of opioids.

1059
00:58:08,405 --> 00:58:12,035
<i> Did you attribute your success to Adderall? </ i>

1060
00:58:12,117 --> 00:58:15,413
It's not that I thought
I was cheating,

1061
00:58:15,496 --> 00:58:17,457
but I did not know if it was still me.

1062
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:23,630
Should I feel good about achieving something,

1063
00:58:23,712 --> 00:58:26,925
knowing that I took Adderall
and that helped me

1064
00:58:27,007 --> 00:58:28,426
to focus on it,

1065
00:58:28,509 --> 00:58:35,308
instead of struggling with pain
and fatigue?

1066
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:38,144
Particularly after having
these injuries.

1067
00:58:38,227 --> 00:58:41,231
Dislocated shoulder, lumbar disc herniation,

1068
00:58:41,313 --> 00:58:48,238
<i> LLI tear, tendon tear
of the hamstring, of the quadriceps. </ i>

1069
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,824
The Adderall helped me with all that.

1070
00:58:53,575 --> 00:58:57,288
<i> The problem was that that feeling
of productivity, </ i>

1071
00:58:57,371 --> 00:59:00,750
<i> and having conquered the world that day, </ i>

1072
00:59:00,833 --> 00:59:06,506
<i> took me into a depressive spiral and ... </ i>

1073
00:59:06,588 --> 00:59:07,588
It was a downer.

1074
00:59:07,631 --> 00:59:10,718
And before that fall, I took a little more.

1075
00:59:10,801 --> 00:59:14,138
One 70 milligrams in the morning,

1076
00:59:14,221 --> 00:59:17,767
that complemented with two of 20 milligrams

1077
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:19,894
throughout the day.

1078
00:59:20,644 --> 00:59:24,399
<i> However, the downturn does not go away
when you take more. </ i>

1079
00:59:24,481 --> 00:59:27,902
You rise, but then you fall back.

1080
00:59:30,779 --> 00:59:33,241
<i> It was somewhat strenuous. </ i>

1081
00:59:33,323 --> 00:59:38,580
How to run
without the body moving.

1082
00:59:40,914 --> 00:59:44,127
<i> I felt like it was floating out of my body. </ i>

1083
00:59:47,171 --> 00:59:50,592
<i> If you are depressed
and you stop taking the Adderall, </ i>

1084
00:59:50,674 --> 00:59:53,887
that can accentuate the depression.

1085
00:59:54,469 --> 00:59:55,638
<i> That could be my case. </ i>

1086
00:59:55,721 --> 00:59:57,307
<i> When you do not take it, </ i>

1087
00:59:57,389 --> 01:00:01,686
<i> It's easy to get lost in thoughts. </ i>

1088
01:00:02,644 --> 01:00:05,356
<i> I dislike not doing it on my own. </ i>

1089
01:00:05,439 --> 01:00:06,608
It's because of the Adderall.

1090
01:00:07,191 --> 01:00:09,235
<i> It's a competition with myself. </ i>

1091
01:00:11,195 --> 01:00:14,532
<i> I had an identity crisis when I left it. </ i>

1092
01:00:14,615 --> 01:00:17,452
Taking it and not taking it made me feel

1093
01:00:17,534 --> 01:00:19,579
as two different people.

1094
01:00:20,454 --> 01:00:22,248
<i> Very different people. </ i>

1095
01:00:22,331 --> 01:00:23,541
<i> Red three! </ i>

1096
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,211
Halfway.

1097
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:31,257
For being an amphetamine,
it speeds up your metabolism

1098
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:35,136
<i> and it leaves you dry. It dehydrates you
the muscles and tissues, </ i>

1099
01:00:35,219 --> 01:00:37,013
<i> and that attracts injuries. </ i>

1100
01:00:37,095 --> 01:00:39,390
That was a challenge for me,

1101
01:00:39,473 --> 01:00:44,479
just like staying hydrated
when I used it

1102
01:00:44,561 --> 01:00:46,648
I really believed that I had ADD.

1103
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:52,153
It seemed like a medical problem
that required treatment.

1104
01:00:52,236 --> 01:00:54,864
But when I used Adderall
for study

1105
01:00:54,947 --> 01:00:57,075
or some acquaintance did the same,

1106
01:00:57,157 --> 01:01:00,453
for me that was a substance abuse.

1107
01:01:00,536 --> 01:01:03,581
However, I did not see it that way
but until later,

1108
01:01:03,664 --> 01:01:06,125
when I saw that he was drinking so much.

1109
01:01:06,208 --> 01:01:11,005
Then, when he noticed that he had problems
for sleeping

1110
01:01:11,088 --> 01:01:15,677
and that I was consuming other substances
For that,

1111
01:01:16,426 --> 01:01:19,347
I thought: "This is not a good cycle."

1112
01:01:20,514 --> 01:01:24,602
<i> When I no longer had a prescription
for the Adderall and the Vyvanse, </ i>

1113
01:01:24,685 --> 01:01:28,022
<i> I immediately started taking Ritalin. </ i>

1114
01:01:28,105 --> 01:01:30,400
Both serve to treat ADD / ADHD.

1115
01:01:30,482 --> 01:01:34,654
For that diagnosis I had permission
to take Adderall.

1116
01:01:34,736 --> 01:01:36,948
I thought it would be the same.

1117
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:41,327
<i> However, the day I took Ritalin,
I failed the doping test. </ i>

MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS HAVE INCREASED
IN MANY PROFESSIONAL SPORTS

1132
01:02:20,741 --> 01:02:23,703
IN 2015, THE MAJORITY
OF MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS

1133
01:02:23,785 --> 01:02:26,372
WERE GIVEN TO ATHLETES
US TO USE STIMULANTS

1134
01:02:26,455 --> 01:02:28,224
THE ADDERALL IS POPULAR AMONG SPORTSPEOPLE
WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A BENEFIT

1135
01:02:28,248 --> 01:02:30,288
THE USE OF ADDERALL HAS INCREASED
IN THE GREAT LEAGUES

1136
01:02:31,335 --> 01:02:34,214
<i> We have reached the ground
of the controversy. </ i>

1137
01:02:34,296 --> 01:02:37,008
Should everyone have a guardian
for study?

1138
01:02:37,758 --> 01:02:40,887
That helps, but few families
They can afford one.

1139
01:02:41,637 --> 01:02:43,431
<i> Should everyone drink coffee? </ i>

1140
01:02:43,514 --> 01:02:46,226
That transcends psychiatry
and psychology.

1141
01:02:46,308 --> 01:02:47,644
It goes beyond mental health.

1142
01:02:48,227 --> 01:02:49,604
Are there conditions of equality?

1143
01:02:50,395 --> 01:02:54,234
Stimulants and ADHD are
in the center of those conditions.

1144
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:57,237
<i> To do things right, </ i>

1145
01:02:57,319 --> 01:03:01,950
we're going to have to take out the ADHD,
the stigma of mental health

1146
01:03:02,032 --> 01:03:05,620
and the use of drugs in the public eye
and have a debate

1147
01:03:05,702 --> 01:03:09,082
about what we can afford
to increase performance

1148
01:03:09,164 --> 01:03:11,543
and what things we value in society.

1149
01:03:14,253 --> 01:03:19,050
<i> When one spends medicated time,
the experience changes. </ i>

1150
01:03:19,132 --> 01:03:25,306
At first, it was like a fuel,
and I did not need much.

1151
01:03:25,389 --> 01:03:28,643
I took five or ten milligrams a day
and it was good

1152
01:03:28,725 --> 01:03:34,524
There was a lot of optimism
and an obsession to do things.

1153
01:03:34,606 --> 01:03:37,735
It was fun, but that's not the case anymore.

1154
01:03:37,818 --> 01:03:39,195
Now I take 40 a day.

1155
01:03:41,196 --> 01:03:43,491
<i> And I do things to empower him. </ i>

<i> A glass of orange juice </ i>

1159
01:03:55,085 --> 01:03:57,589
It would be very acid,

1160
01:03:57,671 --> 01:04:01,926
and that would destroy much of the Adderall
before being absorbed.

<i> Information that reaches me

Now I know kung fu.

1169
01:04:33,415 --> 01:04:34,876
In the last ten years,

1170
01:04:34,958 --> 01:04:39,756
there has been a lot of debate
on cognitive improvement.

1171
01:04:39,838 --> 01:04:45,011
Much of what has been debated has turned
around the ethical aspect.

1172
01:04:45,093 --> 01:04:46,179
Is it cheating?

1173
01:04:46,261 --> 01:04:48,097
<i> Or if it's safe. </ i>

1174
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:50,600
<i> But everyone seems to take it for granted </ i>

1175
01:04:50,682 --> 01:04:53,478
which is a cognitive improvement.

1176
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:58,608
So we decided to do a test
to find out.

1177
01:04:58,690 --> 01:05:00,902
There are interesting facts,

1178
01:05:00,984 --> 01:05:04,989
of Martha Farah and the laboratory
from the University of Pennsylvania,

1179
01:05:05,072 --> 01:05:08,618
about initial tests

1180
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:11,579
with students without signs of ADHD

1181
01:05:11,662 --> 01:05:14,791
who take stimulants or a placebo

1182
01:05:14,873 --> 01:05:19,462
and perform weekly tests
that measure learning.

1183
01:05:19,545 --> 01:05:24,843
A varied range of tasks was evaluated.

1184
01:05:24,925 --> 01:05:30,014
But, in the end, it was not found
Much difference

1185
01:05:30,097 --> 01:05:33,268
between the Adderall and the placebo,

1186
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:36,479
except for one question:

1187
01:05:36,562 --> 01:05:42,152
<i> "Do you feel that the pill today?
Did you improve cognition? ". </ i>

1188
01:05:43,944 --> 01:05:48,283
<i> One of the conclusions is
that stimulants serve to increase </ i>

1189
01:05:48,365 --> 01:05:51,077
the trust
in the ability to learn.

1190
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:54,747
Amphetamines are used
for intelligence, but they do not work.

1191
01:05:54,830 --> 01:05:59,669
They keep you awake,
when you should be asleep,

1192
01:05:59,751 --> 01:06:03,798
and they help you withstand
the boring tasks.

1193
01:06:03,881 --> 01:06:07,760
But they do not add anything,
no type of cognition.

1194
01:06:07,843 --> 01:06:12,807
The most common effect of amphetamine,
the Adderall,

1195
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:18,271
it is to feel that performance improves.

1196
01:06:18,353 --> 01:06:24,194
And that's important, since you feel
that one does something better

1197
01:06:24,276 --> 01:06:27,280
it serves to motivate
and strengthen trust.

1198
01:06:27,362 --> 01:06:28,948
If you trust your ability

1199
01:06:29,031 --> 01:06:31,367
and you feel motivated to do something,

1200
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:33,453
that could be an improvement,

1201
01:06:33,535 --> 01:06:38,708
even if your CI has not increased
in a concrete way.

1202
01:06:38,790 --> 01:06:41,753
<i> Usually,
the Adderall is the entry point </ i>

1203
01:06:41,835 --> 01:06:45,507
to find out everything
on cognitive enhancers.

1204
01:06:50,177 --> 01:06:54,182
As a young adult who studied
in a good university,

1205
01:06:54,264 --> 01:06:57,185
<i> and worked in investment funds
and coverage, </ i>

1206
01:06:57,267 --> 01:07:01,189
It is impossible to avoid stimulants.

1207
01:07:01,271 --> 01:07:02,273
Or its abuse.

1208
01:07:03,148 --> 01:07:06,486
<i> Is that the concept of medication changed. </ i>

1209
01:07:06,568 --> 01:07:09,781
Before it was to overcome an illness

1210
01:07:09,863 --> 01:07:15,537
and not to use a technicality
and acquire a controlled substance.

1211
01:07:15,619 --> 01:07:20,959
Some friends used Adderall
for purposes other than recommended,

1212
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:24,337
<i> and they were not getting good results. </ i>

1213
01:07:24,419 --> 01:07:26,881
They believed that with him they could be successful.

1214
01:07:26,964 --> 01:07:28,049
Since we did not want that,

1215
01:07:28,131 --> 01:07:32,971
we look for alternatives
with medicines without a prescription.

1216
01:07:33,053 --> 01:07:38,143
We did not want to pretend we had ADHD.

1217
01:07:38,225 --> 01:07:42,355
I came up with a very simple page.

1218
01:07:42,437 --> 01:07:43,731
With three elements.

1219
01:07:43,814 --> 01:07:48,111
One question, one "Yes" button
and one of "No, thanks, I'm fine."

1220
01:07:48,193 --> 01:07:51,322
We could ask:
"Do you want to sleep well?"

1221
01:07:51,405 --> 01:07:54,159
"Yes" or "No, thank you, I'm fine."

1222
01:07:54,241 --> 01:07:57,787
If you choose "No", we go to:
"Do you want to concentrate better?"

1223
01:07:57,870 --> 01:08:00,165
If you choose "Yes", we go to OptiMind LP.

1224
01:08:03,041 --> 01:08:04,544
In that I can help?

1225
01:08:05,294 --> 01:08:08,756
<i> Do you think the brain can do more?
Yes you can. </ I>

1226
01:08:08,839 --> 01:08:13,386
Sometimes they put us in the same bag
with the prescribed stimulants.

1227
01:08:13,969 --> 01:08:15,763
<i> I dislike it, because it's not like that. </ i>

I am a healthy person looking for something
Help her

1231
01:08:27,149 --> 01:08:32,197

<i> I think we all want that better version
of ourselves. </ i>

1234
01:08:37,784 --> 01:08:42,332
We founded AlternaScript
and we use studied ingredients

1235
01:08:42,414 --> 01:08:45,084
by the best institutes
of neuroscience.

1236
01:08:45,167 --> 01:08:47,003
We asked if they worked.

1237
01:08:47,669 --> 01:08:49,547
<i> It was when everything took off. </ i>

1238
01:08:51,048 --> 01:08:54,928
<i> One day, we appeared in an article
from VICE News, </ i>

1239

1242
01:09:04,686 --> 01:09:06,231

<i> The mind is something beautiful.
Give him free rein. </ I>

1244
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:11,859
Anything else?

1245
01:09:12,653 --> 01:09:14,823
You said "excited and dedicated".

1246
01:09:14,905 --> 01:09:18,868
I would change that first sentence a little.

1247
01:09:18,951 --> 01:09:21,287
And I would choose one or the other,

1248
01:09:21,370 --> 01:09:24,332
to accentuate the message more.

1249
01:09:24,414 --> 01:09:26,793
- How about "emodedicado"?
- "Emodedicado"?

1250
01:09:28,544 --> 01:09:31,339
It sounds like a new drug.

1251
01:09:37,094 --> 01:09:40,056
The cognitive improvement is here to stay.

1252
01:09:40,764 --> 01:09:43,601
It is the future of the human species.

1253
01:09:44,476 --> 01:09:46,020
<i> All this is inevitable. </ i>

<i> either physically or cognitively. </ i>

1258

Many in Silicon Valley are

1261
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:19,512

<i> to further expand the vision of things, </ i>

1263
01:10:23,474 --> 01:10:26,478
and at the same time take advantage of the benefits
to focus

1264
01:10:29,354 --> 01:10:33,526
It would not be like wine, marijuana
or what we use to relax.

1265
01:10:33,609 --> 01:10:35,069
ENTREPRENEURIAL ADVERTISING

1266
01:10:35,152 --> 01:10:39,491
I see it more as a supplement,
a tool.

1267
01:10:41,325 --> 01:10:43,161
<i> I use a microdose every four days. </ i>

1268
01:10:43,994 --> 01:10:48,625
<i> I grind the mushrooms until they are pulverized, </ i>

1269
01:10:48,707 --> 01:10:51,336

1270
01:10:51,418 --> 01:10:55,381
<i> 0.2 grams. </ i>

1271
01:10:56,882 --> 01:11:00,011
A microdosis is a tenth of a twentieth

1272
01:11:00,093 --> 01:11:04,140
of the conventional dose
of a psychedelic substance.

1273
01:11:04,223 --> 01:11:06,392
Classical psychedelic substances

1274
01:11:06,475 --> 01:11:11,606
like LSD, psilocybin, mushrooms,
the mescaline, the peyote.

1275
01:11:11,688 --> 01:11:15,318
There is no psychedelic effect.

1276
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,737
The stones do not shine in the least,

1277
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:20,698
and the flowers are not interested in one.

1278
01:11:20,781 --> 01:11:25,245
What's more, if you notice something like that,
Then you have to lower the dose.

1279
01:11:26,662 --> 01:11:29,874
<i> In college, I bought Adderall
to other people. </ i>

1280
01:11:29,957 --> 01:11:32,001
<i> I did not use my own prescription. </ i>

1281
01:11:32,835 --> 01:11:35,588
When I graduated, I felt that work

1282
01:11:35,671 --> 01:11:39,133
He forced me to use my prescription,

1283
01:11:39,216 --> 01:11:42,303
that was 90 milligrams a day.

1284
01:11:42,386 --> 01:11:44,764
The culture here is that everything is for yesterday,

1285
01:11:44,847 --> 01:11:47,600
and that everything must be done quickly.

1286
01:11:47,683 --> 01:11:50,728
I hate that, but they all talk like that.

1287
01:11:50,811 --> 01:11:53,064
It's not normal to be 28 or 29 and talk

1288
01:11:53,147 --> 01:11:55,608
of exhaustion or nervous breakdown.

1289
01:11:55,691 --> 01:11:58,653
WHY WOMEN TAKE
MICRODOSIS OF LSD AT WORK

1290
01:11:58,735 --> 01:12:01,823
Are there better, safer substances?

1291
01:12:01,905 --> 01:12:07,078
that disturb the organism less,

1292
01:12:07,161 --> 01:12:09,247
and with better side effects?

1293
01:12:09,329 --> 01:12:15,128
The substance has no side effects.
It has effects.

1294
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:16,838
The idea is to choose them ...

1295
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:19,924
If you sell, you appeal to certain effects.

1296
01:12:20,007 --> 01:12:23,553
If you want to help tortured people

1297
01:12:23,635 --> 01:12:26,890
for your medications,
you appeal to other effects.

1298
01:12:26,972 --> 01:12:28,933
<i> When using Adderall, there is an urgency </ i>

1299
01:12:29,016 --> 01:12:30,852
<i> that takes you to work fast. </ i>

1300
01:12:30,934 --> 01:12:34,522
<i> But with this, you feel
that you can take some time </ i>

1301
01:12:34,605 --> 01:12:37,901
<i> and that you can do things well,
calmly. </ i>

1302
01:12:37,983 --> 01:12:42,489
The key came to me a few years ago,
when I knew that Albert Hofmann,

1303
01:12:42,571 --> 01:12:45,241
the first to synthesize LSD,

1304
01:12:45,991 --> 01:12:50,788
had said that low doses
They almost did not study.

1305
01:12:50,871 --> 01:12:55,293
And he said that if Sandoz, his company,
I would have been more active,

1306
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:57,629
there would be no market for the Ritalin.

1307
01:12:57,711 --> 01:13:00,840
Instead, we have
this very addictive substance

1308
01:13:00,923 --> 01:13:03,927
that fills the coffers of companies
and the doctors.

1309
01:13:04,009 --> 01:13:06,346
LSD and mushrooms do not do that.

1310
01:13:10,766 --> 01:13:14,938
Count up to four with me.
One two three four.

1311

<i> Start at Disney Junior. </ i>

1312
01:13:16,855 --> 01:13:17,855
I get it.

1313
01:13:19,817 --> 01:13:23,196
What? Why is that face?

1314
01:13:23,278 --> 01:13:28,743
<i> I have not felt the need to take Adderall
since my career ended. </ i>

1315

<i> My mental state has changed. </ i>

1316
01:13:30,828 --> 01:13:36,918
I used to depend on that energy
and that mental chaos.

1317
01:13:37,876 --> 01:13:40,380
<i> It's easy to forget that the main thing </ i>

1318
01:13:40,462 --> 01:13:44,509
<i> is that we are alive and breathe.
We may have problems ... </ i>

1319
01:13:44,591 --> 01:13:50,807
<i> Now meditation has helped me
to focus and to seek mental clarity. </ i>

1320
01:13:50,889 --> 01:13:55,145
There are days when I think:
"What the fuck, I was in the NFL."

1321
01:13:56,061 --> 01:13:59,065
<i> Being a rookie in the league,
Many tell you: </ i>

1322
01:13:59,148 --> 01:14:01,192
"You will not play forever.

1323
01:14:01,275 --> 01:14:03,903
You're in the league for a short time. "

1324
01:14:03,986 --> 01:14:08,199
But you're only 21 years old
and you have just realized your dream.

1325
01:14:08,282 --> 01:14:11,286
All that goes through one ear
and out the other.

1326
01:14:11,368 --> 01:14:14,372
<i> I did the best I could. </ i>

1327

Say everything I had

1328
01:14:15,789 --> 01:14:19,210

To do what?

1357
01:16:16,118 --> 01:16:18,079
He just stole it.

1358
01:16:19,329 --> 01:16:22,625
I went to get the car, and it was gone.

1359

The parents are crying.
When they get to the doctor,

they are crying They feel pain.

1361

They do not know what to do

01:17:50,087 --> 01:17:53,883
but I also think that you appreciate my tenacity,

1382
01:17:53,966 --> 01:17:57,011
because otherwise ...

1383
01:17:58,679 --> 01:18:00,306
Where would we all be?

1384
01:18:04,810 --> 01:18:06,396
<i> I'm lucky. </ i>

1385
01:18:06,478 --> 01:18:11,568
I started this process in the New Year of 2016.

1386
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:15,113
I told my girlfriend, Erin,
I wanted to do the workshop.

1387
01:18:15,195 --> 01:18:20,118
<i> And then I did everything I had to do </ i>

1388
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,328
<i> to make it happen. </ i>

1389
01:18:22,411 --> 01:18:24,289
How to take Adderall.

1390
01:18:27,541 --> 01:18:29,294
<i> I have everything I wanted. </ i>

1391
01:18:29,376 --> 01:18:33,381
<i> The pay is very good,
and they want to recruit me on Google. </ i>

1392
01:18:33,463 --> 01:18:36,885
Is incredible. For me it is.

1393
01:18:36,967 --> 01:18:39,387
<i> It would have been impossible to achieve that </ i>

1394
01:18:39,470 --> 01:18:40,722
<i> without the medication. </ i>

1395
01:18:40,804 --> 01:18:44,350
Maybe because I have
a severe case of ADHD,

1396
01:18:44,433 --> 01:18:47,770
and it's hard for me to work as I should.

1397
01:18:47,853 --> 01:18:51,441
<i> Maybe because it was the fuel
that took me where I should. </ i>

1398
01:18:51,523 --> 01:18:53,818
I do not worry about knowing why.

1399
01:18:55,944 --> 01:18:59,073
Have you ever used stimulants?

1400
01:18:59,156 --> 01:19:02,911
Once, during the first study
of Ritalin.

1401
01:19:02,993 --> 01:19:05,914
<i> It was late afternoon. </ i>

1402
01:19:05,996 --> 01:19:11,085
<i> I felt that the day I surrendered. </ i>

1403
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:16,132
In effect, it was a good experience,

1404
01:19:16,215 --> 01:19:21,638
but thank God I did not put
the hand again in the barrel.

1405
01:19:26,517 --> 01:19:28,061
Did they give you the results?

1406
01:19:28,143 --> 01:19:31,856
Only from the exam I did
this morning, at 10:00.

1407
01:19:32,689 --> 01:19:34,192
I pulled out an "A."

1408
01:19:35,025 --> 01:19:37,946
<i> Stress never goes away completely. </ i>

1409
01:19:38,028 --> 01:19:44,410
But I hope that, upon graduation,
I can do it aside.

1410
01:19:45,702 --> 01:19:47,497
<i> I have a feeling </ i>

1411
01:19:47,579 --> 01:19:50,083
<i> that I'm about to stop using
the Adderall. </ i>

1412
01:19:50,165 --> 01:19:54,504
I hope that, as an adult,
I can handle my time better,

1413
01:19:54,586 --> 01:19:58,967
and that does not have the need
to take prescription medications

1414
01:19:59,049 --> 01:20:00,718
to do what I owe.

1415
01:20:00,801 --> 01:20:01,886
<i> Hopefully it's the end. </ i>

1416
01:20:01,969 --> 01:20:05,473
I do not know where I'm going to be,
but when I think about it,

1417
01:20:05,556 --> 01:20:07,976
I do not see myself taking Adderall.

1418
01:20:09,017 --> 01:20:11,813
<i> The Adderall serves to focus me
at work. </ i>

1419
01:20:11,895 --> 01:20:14,941
<i> If I get to the point
where my work flowed only </ i>

1420
01:20:15,023 --> 01:20:18,027
and things were fine,
I would not take it.

1421
01:20:18,110 --> 01:20:20,405
If tomorrow I won $ 200 million,

1422
01:20:20,487 --> 01:20:21,948
I would not take more Adderall.

1423
01:20:22,030 --> 01:20:23,992
But I need it to play,

1424
01:20:24,074 --> 01:20:27,036
because otherwise,
I forgot to play the lottery.

1425
01:20:29,288 --> 01:20:31,791
<i> I'm more boring when I'm on medication. </ i>

1426
01:20:31,874 --> 01:20:33,793
<i> And I'm more upset. </ i>

1427
01:20:33,876 --> 01:20:37,130
<i> Yesterday I had to study all day,
and I took Vyvanse </ i>

1428
01:20:37,212 --> 01:20:39,716
and Adderall. I was medicated all day.

1429
01:20:39,798 --> 01:20:42,886
I felt bad, but I did
what I had to do.

1430
01:20:42,968 --> 01:20:46,055
It is an act of balance
what you must define

1431
01:20:50,434 --> 01:20:54,689
<i> This of higher education
It's disappointing me. </ i>

1432
01:20:54,771 --> 01:20:56,983
<i> You need a title to be someone. </ i>

1433
01:20:57,065 --> 01:21:00,862
As twenties, we are drugged
with medicine for ADD,

1434
01:21:00,944 --> 01:21:03,198
competing among us ...

1435
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,742
For what? To get good grades?

1436
01:21:07,117 --> 01:21:09,537
<i> A dynamic is taking place </ i>

1437
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:15,752
<i> where people are taking
dangerous drugs, </ i>

1438
01:21:15,834 --> 01:21:17,837
in an inappropriate way.

1439
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,466
And it also resembles
a little bit to an arms race,

1440
01:21:21,548 --> 01:21:26,513
<i> in which to see that the competition
he is doing it, </ i>

1441
01:21:26,595 --> 01:21:29,307
one feels that he must also do it.

1442
01:21:30,265 --> 01:21:37,190
<i> Focus on the use or abuse,
depends on who you think, </ i>

1443
01:21:37,272 --> 01:21:39,651
It is a symptom of something bigger.

1444
01:21:40,818 --> 01:21:44,364
<i> This highly competitive environment, </ i>

1445
01:21:44,446 --> 01:21:48,368
<i> in which people feel that they should </ i>

1446
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:52,038
<i> compete beyond your means
to stand out. </ i>

1447
01:21:53,539 --> 01:21:56,334
<i> This commitment </ i>

1448
01:21:56,416 --> 01:22:01,172
<i> in material progress
and productivity ... </ i>

1449
01:22:02,256 --> 01:22:03,967
At what price?

1450
01:22:04,049 --> 01:22:07,303
Are we willing to pay it?

1451
01:22:08,428 --> 01:22:11,766
<i> I would not say I'm happy to have the Adderall, </ i>

1452
01:22:11,849 --> 01:22:15,353
but I'm glad
make it an option for him.

1453
01:22:18,939 --> 01:22:20,483
<i> Do not use it so much </ i>

1454
01:22:20,566 --> 01:22:24,529
<i> has allowed me to feel more comfortable
with myself. </ i>

1455
01:22:27,573 --> 01:22:30,118
<i> I would never give Adderall to my son </ i>

1456
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,245
<i> because I know the effects, </ i>

1457
01:22:32,327 --> 01:22:34,747
<i> and they are not funny at all. </ i>

1458
01:22:35,622 --> 01:22:36,875
<i> I find it very comfortable </ i>

1459
01:22:36,957 --> 01:22:40,670
give your child something similar
to methamphetamine without thinking.

1460
01:22:41,587 --> 01:22:45,133
<i> There are alternatives.
You can teach him how to concentrate. </ I>

1461
01:22:51,638 --> 01:22:53,433
The idea was to be the best.

1462
01:22:55,767 --> 01:23:02,734
The NFL is a symbol of that level.

1463
01:23:04,067 --> 01:23:08,907
Do you regret having taken Ritalin?

1464
01:23:11,492 --> 01:23:15,121
No. I did what I had to do.

1465
01:23:15,204 --> 01:23:20,543
And I'm glad to have passed
to this stage of my life.

1466
01:23:20,626 --> 01:23:25,715
It's not a hole you can not get out of.

1467
01:23:27,883 --> 01:23:31,012
<i> Adderall, the drug of our time. </ i>

1468
01:23:31,929 --> 01:23:36,976
<i> I guess if we all took Adderall, </ i>

1469
01:23:37,059 --> 01:23:40,230
<i> we would stop asking:
"What's the point of everything?" </ I>

1470
01:23:43,357 --> 01:23:45,151
I lost the idea One second.

1471
01:23:45,234 --> 01:23:48,404
I had an example.

1472
01:23:49,863 --> 01:23:56,037
<i> That would also be lost
what humans do </ i>

1473
01:23:56,119 --> 01:24:00,500
<i> when they ponder or reflect, </ i>

1474
01:24:01,333 --> 01:24:03,920
<i> and when the mind wanders. </ i>

1475
01:24:05,087 --> 01:24:06,464
Now I remember.

1476
01:24:07,047 --> 01:24:10,009
<i> What emerges from there? </ i>

1477
01:24:10,092 --> 01:24:13,054
<i> Creativity, art, </ i>

1478
01:24:13,971 --> 01:24:17,308
<i> extraordinary moments
of human contact. </ i>

1479
01:24:18,976 --> 01:24:23,648
But also intense moments
of pain and affliction.

1480
01:24:24,231 --> 01:24:29,529
That is part of the experience
of being human.

1481
01:24:34,992 --> 01:24:36,119
CONTINUE?
DO NOT

1482
01:24:36,201 --> 01:24:38,288
YES
