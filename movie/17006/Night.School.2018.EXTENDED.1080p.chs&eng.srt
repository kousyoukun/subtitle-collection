00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,970
那真是大师级示范
That was a master class.

142
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,060
我都无法让巴比·福雷(美国名厨)买那大家伙
I couldn't get Bobby Flay to buy that beast.

143
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,810
你知道吗? 当我看到他的包
You know what? Once I saw the man-purse

144
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,850
我就知道他逃不出我的手掌心
the guy was putty in my hands. He really was.

145
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,190
泰迪 我要告诉你 你就像我梦想中的儿子
Teddy, I just want you to know, you are like the son I never had.

146
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,400
是吗 我说 拜托 你有乔·朱尼尔
Well, I mean, come on, you got Joe Junior.

147
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,280
嗯 是的 他的确是我的儿子
Well, yeah, but he's the son I do have

148
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,580
而我见他没那么开心
and I'm just not all that crazy about him.

149
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,870
我是说 瞧瞧他
I mean, look at him.

150
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,830
但我的想法是 多年以前
But my point is this, all those years ago

151
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,500
我有幸遇到了一个少年
I took a chance on a pimply-faced teenager.

152
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,460
我的小加里·科尔曼 我的小韦伯斯特
My little Gary Coleman. My little Webster.

153
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,710
事实证明我们两个人很伟大
And it turned out great for both of us.

154
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,010
所以我决定 当我退休时...
So I've decided, when I retire...

155
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,390
我要把烧烤城
I'm turning Barbecue City

156
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,680
留给你
over to you.

157
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,520
抱歉?
Excuse me?

158
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,190
什么?
What?

159
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:05,980
别逗我
Don't shit me.

160
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,150
我是认真的!
I'm serious!

161
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,150
哦 天啊 乔! 我鸡皮疙瘩都起来了!
Oh, my God, Joe! I just got goose bumps!

162
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,530
- 是啊  - 我一身鸡皮疙瘩!
- Yes. - I got goose bumps all over!

163
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,200
我不知道该说什么 伙计! 谢谢你!
I don't know what to say, man! Thank you!

164
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,280
不 谢谢你 儿子
No, thank you, son.

165
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,240
你在说什么 乔?
Whatchu talkin' bout, Joe?

166
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,750
来吧 德拉蒙德先生
You better come here, Mr. Drummond.

167
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,830
全是你的 泰迪
All yours, Teddy.

168
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,790
你觉得怎么样? 哦...
What do you think? Oh...

169
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,380
真是太棒了
It's amazing.

170
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,460
- 真的?  - 是啊
- Really? - Yeah.

171
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,670
但作为你的非正式财务顾问
But as your unofficial financial adviser,

172
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,180
我有责任告诉你 这枚戒指远超你的预算了
I'm obligated to tell you that this ring is way out of your budget.

173
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,430
放松
Relax.

174
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,310
丽莎很酷 她知道你是谁
Lisa's cool as hell. She knows who you are.

175
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,310
丽莎不知道我是谁
Lisa does not know who I am.

176
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,100
丽莎知道我是一个优秀的烧烤推销员
Lisa knows that I'm a successful barbecue salesman.

177
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,560
马文知道泰迪是一个高中辍学生
Marvin knows that Teddy's a high school dropout

178
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:48,980
一个月光族
who's living paycheck to paycheck

179
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,980
因为我和一个消受不起的女人在一起
'cause I'm with a woman that's way above my weight class.

180
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,900
你的生活建立在金融贷款之上
Your life is built on a financial house of cards.

181
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,780
- 别提了  - 保时捷 复式小楼
- Stop it. - The Porsche, the duplex.

182
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,240
你想证明什么?
What are you trying to prove?

183
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,370
而且 每次我们出去 都是她要求付账
Plus, every single time we go out, she offers to pay for the check.

184
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,120
我让她放下银行卡的那天
The day that I let her put down her plastic

185
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,370
就是我失去她的那天
is the day that I lose her.

186
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,370
- 你知道的  - 我不知道我为什么这么紧张
- And you know that. - I don't know why I was so nervous.

187
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,710
- 嘿  - 嗨
- Hey. - Hi.

188
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,790
丽莎
Lisa.

189
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,170
你好
Hi.

190
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,260
兄弟 丽莎是我遇到的最美好的人
Dude, Lisa's the best thing that ever happened to me.

191
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,220
我不想搞砸 伙计
I don't wanna mess this one up, man.

192
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,840
- 我告诉了他们  - 他说了
- I told them. - He did.

193
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,220
- 他的确那样说了  - 哦!
- He actually said that. - Ooh!

194
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,810
- 一些甜点  - 看起来真棒
- Some dessert. - That looks amazing.

195
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,350
- 哇哦  - 谢谢你 哇
- Wow. - Thank you. Wow.

196
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,310
大厨克莱芒还说不用买单
Chef Clemont also said that there will be no check.

197
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,560
他请客
This is all on him.

198
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:29,770
哇哦
Wow.

199
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,900
我知道他会这样
I knew he would try this.

200
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,650
你知道吗? 告诉他我很感激 但我坚持付钱
You know what? Tell him I appreciate it, but I insist on paying.

201
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,240
- 好的  - 好的 好吧 等一下
- Okay. - Okay, well, just wait.

202
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,990
好吧 先等等 亲爱的
Well, hold on now, honey.

203
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,570
亲爱的 你不想不给他面子吧 你是他的客人 对吧?
Honey, you don't want to offend him. You're his guest, right?

204
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,200
相信我 客户不会免费请你吃饭
Trust me, you never take a free meal from a client.

205
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,490
只有这样 你才不欠他们什么
That way, you don't owe them anything.

206
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,540
没错
That's true.

207
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,250
- 谢谢你 丽莎 感谢  - 你知道的
- Thank you, Lisa. Appreciate it. - You know.

208
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,750
- 可以付款了  - 谢谢你
- Whenever you're ready. - Thank you.

209
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,750
你知道吗 宝贝? 如果是这样 那么让我...
You know what then, baby? If that's the case, then let me...

210
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,000
不 宝贝 这是我的事 我们有8个人 让我来
No. Baby, this is my thing. There's, like, eight of us. I got it.

211
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,880
- 你能报销对吧?  - 是的
- You can probably write it off, right? - Yes.

212
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,470
我没有想到这一点 这是商业开支 好的
I didn't think about that. It is a business expense. Okay.

213
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,680
- 来吧  - 等等 等一下 丽莎
- Come on. - Wait, wait. Hold up, Lis.

214
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,050
这是商业开支 但是 丽莎
It is a business expense, but, Lis,

215
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,220
很明显 泰迪真的想请客
it's clear that Teddy really wants to treat.

216
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,020
我们在这里为你庆祝 让他来吧
We're out here celebrating you. Let him.

217
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,980

218
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,650

219
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,900
没错
Yes.

220
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,610
我们怎么能不友好? 既然你这么懂我
Why aren't we closer? 'Cause you get me.

221
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,160
我可以的 我来付
I have it. I got it.

222
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,490
- 我爱你  - 也爱你

223
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,830
- 黑人的爱  - 好的
- Black love. - Okay.

224
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,740
哦 该死
Oh, shit.

225
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,570
好的 马文 给我吧 谢谢
All right, Marvin. Hit me. Thank you.

226
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,530
- 真不错  - 他做的我的最爱之一
- It's so good. - One of my favorite things that he does.

227
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,290
- 那个焦糖馅饼 他以之闻名  - 很好
- That caramel tart, he's known for it. - All right.

228
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,960
哦 我要吃一块 绝对要尝尝
Oh, I gotta get in that. Definitely gonna try that.

229
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,960
真美味
So amazing.

230
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,630
这些很漂亮不是吗? 他专门为我们做的
Aren't these beautiful? He did these just for us.

231
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,630
- 是吗?  - 是的 你应该尝尝这个馅饼
- Did he? - Yeah. You should try this caramel.

232
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,920
- 我要尝一点这个  - 吃那些
- I'm gonna take a little bit of it. - Get in there.

233
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,010
打断一下 丽莎 打断一下
Take me through. Lisa, take me through.

234
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,970
所以这是一把椅子 很明显 是一把椅子
So this is a chair. Straight up, it's a chair.

235
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,510
我很清楚
I know that much.

236
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,890
给我说说椅子背后的故事
Give me the Behind the Music about the chair.

237
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,260
假装我做个采访
Pretend I'm on VH 1 or something like that.

238
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,180
实际上 这些椅子有一个非常有趣的故事
Well, actually, these chairs have a very interesting story.

239
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,890
它们来自丹麦 在仓库里找到它们
They're from Denmark. Found them in a warehouse.

240
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,310
中世纪 又现代 不规则圆形
Mid-century, modern, kind of rounded.

241
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,730
是啊 我知道它是蓝色的什么的
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know it's blue and stuff like that.

242
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,150
我不知道你这么喜欢椅子
I didn't know you were so into chairs.

243
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,280
你不会相信
You would not believe.

244
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,070
回到家 我会看着我的椅子 突然我会脑洞大开
I'll go home, I'll look at my chair, I get turned on in a second.

245
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,660
- 这只是我的一种癖好  - 你会喜欢这些的
- It's just a weird fetish of mine. - You would love these.

246
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,990
因为我不知道你是否注意到了墙纸有点暗淡的蔚蓝色
Because I don't know if you noticed the cerulean kind of undertone

247
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,290
但我们想把它们联系起来
of the wallpaper, but we kind of wanted to tie it all together

248
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,660
中和过于僵直的线条
to kind of offset the harder, more straighter lines.

249
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,830
那是什么?
What is that?

250
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,630
哦 我的天
Oh, my God.

251
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,630
哦 我的天!
Oh, my God!

252
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,550
不 不 不!
No, no, no!

253
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,380
什么? 先生 甜点有问题吗?
What? Is there a problem with the dessert, sir?

254
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,010
我想蛋糕上有阴毛
I think that's pubic hair in the cake.

255
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,470
- 哦 我的天  - 天啊
- Oh, my God. - Oh, my gosh.

256
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,470
这该死的甜点里是阴毛吗?
Is this pubic hair in my damn dessert?

257
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,720
可以让我?
May I?

258
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,100
- 抱歉 什么?  - 我可以看看吗?
- I'm sorry, what? - May I please take it?

259
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,230
明显 我要告诉你这是什么
Literally, I'm telling you what it is.

260
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,110
太多的阴毛了
This is way too many pubes.

261
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,160
那是什么意思?
What does that mean?

262
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,620
我的意思是 一块糕点上太多阴毛了 如果你能告诉大厨
I mean, one is too many pubes. If you could tell the chef.

263
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,330
谢谢 谢谢你为我们处理此事
Thank you. Thank you for taking care of this for us.

264
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,120
我相信是你掺进了这些
I believe you planted these.

265
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,500
不 不 不 你刚刚说什么?
No, no, no. What did you just say?

266
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,670
稍等 听我说 现在你太疯狂了
Stop. I got this. Now, that's insane of you.

267
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,550
我一生都了解这个人 他不是一个掺阴毛的人 先生
I've known this man my entire life. He's not a pube planter, sir.

268
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,010
不 不 别说了 马文 停下
No, no, stop, Marv. Stop.

269
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,260
也许你掺进了它们
Maybe you planted them.

270
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,630
- 什么?  - 嘣
- What? - Boom.

271
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,930
我冒着生命危险来到这个国家
I risked my life coming to this country

272
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,300
所以我可以在陌生人的芝士蛋糕里掺进阴毛?
so I can plant pubes on some random guy's cheesecake?

273
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,720
我不知道你喜欢怎样 伙计
I don't know what you're into, man.

274
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,770
我告诉你件新鲜事 伙计 我的毛剃掉了
And I have a flash of news for you, guy. I manscape down here.

275

Okay. That's my woman, and that's too much information.

而且这些是非裔的阴毛
And these are the pubes of an African-American guy.

277
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,280
- 哦 见鬼  - 什么? 这是种族主义 伙计
- Oh, shit. - What? That's racist, man.

278
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,150
这是客观事实
It's descriptive.

279
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,780
事实个屁 这是种族主义
Descriptive, my ass. That's racist.

- 路易斯  - 它们就是 非裔的阴毛
- Luis. - That's what they are. Afro-pubes.

All right? I go to take a bite of my cheesecake,

285
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,880
我的蛋糕里似乎有阴毛
there's what appears to be pubic hair in my cake.

286
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,510
那是他掺进的非裔的又短又卷曲的阴毛
That he planted with his African-American short and curly pubes.

287
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:50,130
再拿非裔说事 我就翻脸干翻你!
Say African-American again, and I'mma get dark and curly in your ass!

288
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,180
- 我就说!  - 再说一遍!
- I will say it again! - Say it again!

289
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,090

You want to dance? 'Cause I'll boogie-woogie.

290

293
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,810
- 不 这就是他想要的  - 谢谢你 谢谢
- No. This is what he wants. - Thank you, thank you.

294
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,230
路易斯 我们去厨房谈谈
Luis, I need to speak to you in the kitchen.

295
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,360
去厨房吧 伙计
Go in the kitchen, man.

296
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,560
你找死
You're going to die.

297
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,400
路易斯 我们去厨房谈
Luis, I need to speak to you in the kitchen.

298
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,190
你惹错人了
You messed with the wrong guy.

299
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,690
路易斯 现在 马上
Luis, right now. Right now.

303
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,950
- 厨师 拜托  - 我不想惹麻烦
- Chef, please. - I don't want to get into it.

304
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,200
感到一种种族主义气氛
Feel like it's a cloud of racism around me.

305
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,830
泰迪 要做什么? 我们今晚的惊喜还不够多吗?
Teddy, what is going on? Haven't we had enough surprises tonight?

306
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:29,750

308
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,050
这都是什么?
What's all this?

309
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:36,430
好吧 我会告诉你要发生什么
Well, I will tell you what's going on.

310
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,300
听我说 乔今天告诉我
So listen to this. Joe told me today

311
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:42,720
等他退休后 他会把所有这些都留给我
that when he retires, he's leaving all of this to me.

312
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,430
宝贝 这太棒了
Baby, that's amazing.

313
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,440
- 我是说 这是人生的转折点  - 是啊
- I mean, it's life-changing. - Yeah.

314
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,270
也许你可以在这里做点什么 换个设计?
And maybe you could put your touch on this place, change the design?

315
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,730
帮它提升到一个新的水平?
Help take it to the next level?

316

我们可以在这里做很多事情 首先 我们可以改下商标
We could do a lot with this place. First of all, we could change the logo.

320
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,950
烧烤国 烧烤狩猎
Barbecue Nation. Barbecue Safari.

321
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,450
我是说 我们可以做很多事情
I mean, there's so many things we could do.

322
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,710
老实说 我有很多想法

Wait, the ring. Here, you gotta put the ring on.

328
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,400
哦 我的天 我爱它

Let's celebrate then.

330
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,240
- 你知道我要喝香槟  - 哦 我的天
- You know I had to get some champagne. - Oh, my God.

331
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,910
我说 “瞧 我的宝贝会喜欢它”
I said, "Look, and my baby gonna like it."

00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,620
让我为我的未婚妻倒一些香槟

All right, let's make a toast.

335
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,380
- 为我们  - 为我们
- To us. - To us.

336
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,720
宝贝?
Baby?

337
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,840
你闻到煤气味了吗?
Do you smell gas?

338
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:05,310
我很紧张 宝贝 我不知道你能闻到 我试试...
I was nervous, babe. I didn't know you'd smell it. I tried...

339
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:08,980
不 其实是丙烷?
No. Actual propane?

340
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,270
你为什么不出去透透气?
Why don't you go stand outside?

341
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,480
我会把这里收拾好 然后我带你回家
I'll situate everything in here, and I'll get you home.

342
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,560
好的
Okay.

343
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,980
- 爱你  - 准备好
- Love you. - Be ready.

344
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:21,780
所以 伙计们 我可爱的小泰迪熊刚刚向我求婚了
So, guys, my sweet little Teddy bear just popped the question.

345
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,990
然后大惊喜...
And big surprise...

346
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,500
我说好的!
I said yes!

347
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,290
该死!
Shit!

348
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,300
哦 该死! 哦 该死!
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

349
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,260
哦! 天啊! 宝贝!
Oh! God! Baby!

350
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,020
泰迪 你没事吧?
Teddy, are you okay?

351
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,810
我需要你告诉我的未婚妻 这里出了意外
I need you to tell my fiancée there's been an accident.

352
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,520
宝贝 是我
Baby, it's me.

353
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:58,320
- 是吗?  - 你能看到我吗? 泰迪?
- Yeah? - Can you see me? Teddy?

354
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,150
我是你的未婚妻
I'm your fiancée.

355
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:03,530
很好 我出意外了
Good. I've been in an accident.

356
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,450
哦 宝贝
Oh, baby.

357
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,080
所以乔没有保险?
So Joe didn't have insurance?

358
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,790
是的 当然 他有 马文
Yeah, of course, he did, Marv.

359
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,920
他拿钱跑路去了佛罗里达
He took the money and ran off to Florida.

360
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,090
伙计 我一直在到处找工作 伙计
Dude, I've been looking for a job everywhere, man.

361
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:21,050
但是 烧烤城月度最佳员工却找不到像样的销售工作
But there are no decent sales jobs for an employee of the month at Barbecue City.

362
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,550
我们这里可以雇你 但你必须有高中毕业证
We'd hire you here, but you need to get your GED.

363
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,720
想一想
Think about it.

364
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:28,310
这些家伙整天忽悠客户连他们自己都不懂的基金
These guys bullshit clients all day about funds they don't understand.

365
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,470
你没问题的
You would be a natural.

366
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,060
所以你是说如果我从高中毕业
So you're saying that if I graduate from high school

367
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,270
你就可以给我这里的工作?  - 是啊
that then you could give me job here? - Yeah.

368
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,600
但是你讨厌上学 所以我们为什么要谈这个呢?
But you hate school so why are we even having this conversation?

369
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,270
不 不 不 我不是在说上学
No, no, no. I'm not talking about going to school.

370
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,320
我说的是我的高中毕业证
I'm talking about gettin' my GED.

371
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,110
这不一样
And that's different.

372
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,530
看 要拿到高中毕业证 我要做的就是去学校
See, to get my GED, all I gotta do is go to the school,

373
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,860
奉承一下校长
charm the principal a little bit.

374
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:46,950
- 对吧?  - 是啊
- Right? - Yeah.

375
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,120
得到我想要的 就是我的高中毕业证 听起来很容易 马文
Get what I want, which is my GED. Sounds pretty easy to me, Marv.

376
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,750
如果你能拿到毕业证...
If you got your GED...

377
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,210
我可能能帮你搞定
I could probably hook you up.

378
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,790
不过 听我说 等等 先等等 好吗?
Listen to me, though. Stop. Stop, okay?

379
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,130
给自己留个台阶
Do yourself a favor

380
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,460
在一切妥当之前不要告诉丽莎
and do not tell Lisa about this until it's a done deal.

381
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,960
现在 你知道我长记性了 马文
Now, you know I'm smarter than that, Marv.

382
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,050
你要做一名金融分析师?
You're gonna be a financial analyst?

383
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,130
是的 我会的!
Yes, I am!

384
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,260
是的 宝贝 很快就开始了
I am, babe, and it starts immediately.

385
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,810
我和马文说了 他说他们的确可以用一个
I was talking to Marv, and he says that they could really use somebody

386
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,720
我这样的人在他公司
with my skill set at his firm.

387
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:13,850
那太好了!
That's great!

388
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,310
这是个很好的机会
That's a great opportunity.

389
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,940
是啊 我是说
Yeah. I mean,

390
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,860
我满怀期待 你知道吧?
I'm basically pumped up about it. You know?

391
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,280
你能屈能伸 宝贝 你在恢复活力
You are so resilient, baby. You keep bouncing back.

392
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,530
我真为你感到骄傲
I am so proud of you.

393
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,650
是啊
Yeah.

394
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,820
我爱你
I love you.

395
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,370
我也爱你
I love you, too.

396
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,620
妈 丁字裤当然会勒进屁股
Ma, of course the thong is gonna cut you in the booty hole.

397
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,790
这就是它的作用
That's what it do.

398
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,160
听着 下次里昂想把一个人卡在丁字裤上
Look, next time Leon wanna stick somebody in a thong,

399
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,880
你告诉他 让他穿上去照照镜子
you tell him that he need to put it on and get a mirror

400
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,500
看看他的蛋蛋会怎么样
and check and see what his balls do.

401
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,460
我不在乎他是不是你的牧师!
I don't care if he is your pastor!

402
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,930
教会知道他是那样的变态吗?
Do the congregation know he a freak like that?

403
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,850
等一下 妈妈
Hold on, Mama.

404
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,640
我能帮你吗 先生?
Can I help you, sir?

405
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,850
我不是有意的 但不小心听到你的对话
I couldn't help but overhear your conversation.

406
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,650
- 抱歉?  - 你声音有点大
- Excuse me? - You kind of loud.

407
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,360
是吗 那就离开我的车
Well, then get out my car.

408
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,900
我不在你车里 我显然在我的车里
I'm not in your car. I'm clearly in my car.

409
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,150
- 不 你在我车里  - 你的声音足够大...
- No, you're in my car. - You're speaking loud enough...

410
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,900
你是干什么的? 音量管控警察?
What are you? The volume control police?

411
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,070
我不确定是否有那种警察
I'm not sure if that's even a thing.

412
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,870
- 管好你自己的事  - 你的事正变成我的事
- Mind your business. - Your business is becoming my business.

413
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,280
你为什么不修好你的挡风玻璃呢?
Why don't you work on your windshield?

414
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,740
现在你真是我的事了
Now you're really in my business.

415
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,910
你看它时 可能像万花筒一样吧
Probably look like a kaleidoscope when you look through it.

416
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,120
你知道吗 你为什么不...
You know, why don't you just...

417
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,410
你可能觉得自己像只小蜜蜂
You probably feel like a little honeybee.

418
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,630
- 够了 - 同时看18个角度
- Enough. - Looking at 18 things at one time,

419
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,080
但实际上 你只是在看一样东西
but really, you're just looking at one thing.

420
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,460
我现在要管管你的事了
I'mma get in your business now.

421
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,470
告诉你妈 她可以去给她讨厌的屁股买一盒丁字裤
Tell your mother that she can go buy a box of G-strings with her nasty ass.

422
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,840
你现在在说我妈妈?
You talking about my mama now?

423
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:35,140
上帝不会原谅把丁字裤穿在蛋蛋上的牧师的
Any pastor that's putting a thong on his balls ain't right with God.

424
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,970
- 呸 什么?  - 不要“呸”我
- Psh. What? - Don't "psh" me.

425
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,310
耶
Yeah.

426
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,770
我打赌那会伤到你的喉咙
I bet that hurt your throat.

427
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,020
开你的车
Drive your car.

428
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,110
- 什么 妈妈?  - 你老妈真讨厌
- What, Mama? - Your mother's nasty.

429
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,900
女孩 是的 一个磨人的小妖精
Girl, yeah, that's a little burnt leprechaun

430
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,940
坐在我旁边等该死的灯 听到我们的谈话
sitting next to me at this damn light, all in our conversation.

431
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,570
- 抱歉? 嘿!  - 不 女孩 你知道他不会没钱
- Excuse me? Hey! - Nah, girl, you know he ain't got no gold.

432
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,370
- 你知道他不会没钱  - 你长大了会怎么样?
- You know he ain't got no gold. - How about you grow up?

433
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,950
- 再见 嘘  - 嘿!
- Bye, boo. - Hey!

434
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:01,620
说到钱 要是你... 该死的 泰迪
Speaking of toast, if you... God damn it, Teddy.

435
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:03,920
- 还有事...  - 嘿 哟!
- Gotta work... - Hey, yo!

436
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,040
- 你按谁...  - 我们走吧!
- Who you honking... - Let's go!

437
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,710
我看不到 我的镜子呢?
I can't even see. Where's my mirror?

438
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,000
- 走啊 伙计!  - 嘿! 你在按谁?
- Go, man! - Hey! Who you honking at?

439
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,440
那么 再游戏一场吧 好吗 泰迪?
So, game the system again, did we, Teddy?

440
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,310
斯图尔特 你关我什么事?
Stewart, what is your problem with me?

441
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,820
关你的事 泰迪
My problem with you, Teddy,

442
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,030
像你这样的学生损害了这所高中的声誉
is that students like you bring down the reputation of this high school.

443
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,240
你可能骗过学校的其他人
You may have everybody else at this school fooled,

444
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,740
但我知道你实际是掩饰
but I know you're actually covering up

445
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,780
因为你根本没那么聪明
for the fact that you're really just not that smart.

446
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:43,740
事实上 你可能是这所学校最愚蠢的学生
In fact, you might be the dumbest student at this school.

447
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,720
我是音乐老师
I am the music teacher.

448
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,640
我对教生物一窍不通
I don't know the first thing about teaching biology.

449
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,760
哦 看在上帝的份上!
Oh, for God's sakes!

450
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:05,890
你对“没有音乐项目”还有不明白的部分吗 翠茜?
What part of "There is no musical program" do you not understand, Trish?

451
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,190
没有人能靠巴松奖学金进入常春藤联盟学校
Nobody's getting into Ivy League schools on a bassoon scholarship.

452
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,270
哦 该死!
Oh, shit!

453
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,400
你知道 我擅长读书
You know, I'm not book smart.

454
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,690
斯图尔特比我会读书 但你知道我不是什么?
Stewart's smarter than me. But you know what I'm not?

455
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,530
我不是怪胎 斯图
I'm not a freak of nature, Stew.

456
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:17,700
斯图
Stew.

457
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,200
不要这样做 泰迪
Don't do this, Teddy.

458
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,070
嘿 问个小问题 伙计们
Hey, quick question, everybody.

459
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,830
有没有人见过斯图尔特脱掉衬衫?
Has anybody here ever seen Stewart with his shirt off?

460
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,080
这是胎记! 是胎记!
It's a birthmark! It's a birthmark!

461
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,830
如果那是胎记 让我们立马看看
If it's a birthmark, let us see it right now.

462
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,370
- 证明!  - 你们都想看我的胎记吗?
- Prove it! - You all wanna see my birthmark?

463
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,460
来吧 急死我了!
Come on, I'm dying!

464
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,750
我会证明的! 看?
I'll prove it! See?

465
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,460
是胎记!
It's a birthmark!

466
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,720
你胸前有一个猪屁眼 伙计
You got a pig's butthole on your chest, man.

467
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,890
那没有洞 所以它怎么可能是屁眼呢?
There's no hole in it, so how could it be a butthole?

468
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,850
你有第三个乳头 伙计!
You got a third nipple, man!

469
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,720
下一个是谁 多洛雷斯?
Who's next, Dolores?

470
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,640
这个年轻人
This young man right here.

471
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,150
嘿! 还好吗 斯图尔特?
Hey! What's up, Stewart?

472
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,650
我们过去那么好 不是吗?
We had good times, didn't we?

473
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,190
我们过去那么愉快
I laugh at how much we laughed.

474
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,080
那么 你担任校长多久了 伙计?
So, how long you been the principal, man?

475
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,330
两年了
Going on two years.

476
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,420
- 哇哦  - 是啊
- Wow. - Yeah.

477
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:19,510
不容易 但用我的头脑和球棒整肃了这个地方
Wasn't easy, but cleaned this place up using my brain and my bat.

478
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,340
跟我们高中时候不同
As opposed to when we went to high school,

479
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,090
现在如果你的平均分只有D 你就不用上了
now if you have a D average, you're out.

480
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,510
你能这样做吗?
Can you do that?

481
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,260
我可以做任何我想做的事 泰迪
I can do whatever I want, Teddy.

482
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,980
这是我的地盘
This my house.

483
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,560
对不起 刚刚说什么?
I'm sorry. What was the last part?

484
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:33,810
我说看看你周围
I said look around you.

485
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:39,440
这是我的地盘
This is my house.

486
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,530
对不起 请问 你用的黑人腔调吗?
Excuse me for asking, but are you doing a black voice?

487
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,740
不 不 不是黑人腔调
No. No. Not a black voice.

488
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,620
- 你确定?  - 我听不出跟种族有关
- You sure? - I don't hear color.

489
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,710
是什么让你回到皮埃蒙特了 沃克先生?
What brings you back to Piedmont, Mr. Walker?

490
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,500
现在 我正在从一份出色的销售工作换到
Right now, I'm transitioning from an amazing job in sales

491
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,580
一份金融工作
to a job in finance.

492
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,380
唯一阻碍这种转变的事是
And the only thing that's really holding up this transition

493
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,090
我没有高中毕业证
is me not having my GED.

494
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,970
所以 我不知道 我在想
So, I don't know, I was thinking

495
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,180
也许我可以让你想想办法
maybe I could get you to cross some T's, dot some I's.

496
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,640
也许你可以帮帮这位老朋友
Maybe you could do a favor for an old friend.

497
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,020
有些事永远不会改变 泰迪?
Some things just never change, Teddy?

498
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:16,020
你希望我帮你走捷径获得文凭
You want me to help you find a shortcut to getting your diploma.

499
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,360
不 没错
No. Yes.

500
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,740
我希望我能 我真的希望
I wish I could. I really do.

501
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,820
但是你必须去上夜校
But you would have to go to night school

502
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,820
学习如何通过毕业测试
to learn how to pass the GED test

503
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:30,030
不幸的是 我们不提供夜校
and unfortunately, we don't offer night school here.

504
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,290
我很抱歉 泰迪
I'm so sorry, Teddy.

505
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,290
让我送你出去
Let me walk you out.

506
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,710
你想试试她吗?
You wanna touch her?

507
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,840
抱歉?
I'm sorry?

508
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,590
来吧 摸摸我大号的黑蝙蝠
Come on. Touch my big, black bat.

509
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,760
不 我...
No. I'm...

510
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,840
来 打个招呼
Go ahead. Say hi.

511
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,930
啊...
Ah...

512
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,400
你曾经叫我疯狂的斯图尔特 现在你叫我蝙蝠侠
You used to call me crazy Stewart, now you call me Batman.

513
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:03,690
如果...
If...

514
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,860
把Beats耳机拿下来 鲁迪
Remove the Beats by Andre, Rudy.

515
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:09,780
学校规定 校园里不能戴耳机 除非你用罗塞塔石碑（学习软件）
School policy, no headphones on campus unless you're using Rosetta Stone.

516
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:13,330
嘿 斯图 你认为你对待这些孩子的方法正确吗?
Hey, Stew, you think you're taking the right approach here with these kids?

517
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,410
他们看起来有点紧张 伙计
They look a little stressed out, man.

518
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,290
我在帮他们走向社会 泰迪
I am preparing them for the real world, Teddy.

519
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:22,000
好吗? 我可能不是他们最好的朋友 但这里的每个人都尊重我
Okay? I may not be their best friend but everyone here respects me.

520
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,750
- 好吧  - 搞毛呢 斯图尔特?
- Okay. - What the fuck, Stewart?

521
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,760
嘿 嘿 嘿 请注意语言 卡特女士
Hey, hey, hey. Let's watch the language, please, Miss Carter.

522
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,300
为什么把AP微积分加在我的课程里?
Why did you add AP Calculus to my class load?

523
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,890
要知道 我已经有五门课要教了
Knowing good and well I already have five units to teach

524
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,020
再加上夜校 实在是太多了!
plus night school. It's too much!

525
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,730
等等 稍等 你是夜校老师?
Wait. Hold on. You're the night school teacher?

526
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,730
不 我只是喜欢穿上衣的婊子
Nah, I'm just the bitch that likes to wear blouses.

527
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,230
是的 我是夜校老师
Yes, I'm the night school teacher.

528
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,190
你给我拿来烘干的三叶草了吗 小妖精?
Did you bring me some dried shamrocks, leprechaun?

529
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,560
这还是不好笑
It's still not funny.

530
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:44,810
等等!
Wait. Hold up!

531
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,780
斯图尔特 你为什么只告诉我你这里没有夜校?
Stewart, why did you just tell me that you don't have night school here?

532
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,030
你为什么那样说?
Why would you say that?

533
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:52,530
我那样说是因为泰迪和我曾一起上学
I said that because Teddy and I went to school together.

534
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,580
坦率地说 他是一个很糟糕的学生
He is quite frankly a terrible student

535
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,620
我不希望这种人在这里
and I did not want that element in here.

536
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,330
我不在乎他是不是像驴一样蠢
I don't care if he's as dumb as a Minion.

537
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,370
如果他愿意 欢迎他上我的课
He is welcome to take my class if he wants.

538
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,250
谢谢 谢谢这么说
Thank you. Thank you for that.

539
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,710
别客气 因为你需要
You're welcome. 'Cause you need it.

540
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,710
凯瑞 我们可以别这么大声吗?
Carrie, can we just take down the 'tude?

541
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,340
- 大声? 真的?  - 不 我...
- 'Tude? Really? - No, I...

542
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,630
你甚至还没开始见识我的大声
You haven't even seen the beginning of this attitude.

543
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,890
- 等等 你再说一遍  - 我道歉
- Wait, say that to me again. - I apologize.

544
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,390
措辞不当
That was a poor choice of words.

545
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,720
我只是说 我需要你向我表示尊重
I just mean, I need you to show me the respect

546
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,520
对你老板基本的尊重
that you would show your boss.

547
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,930
因为这是你的地盘 对吗?
Because it's your house, right?

548
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,730
你用了黑人腔调跟他说话?
You did the black voice thing with him?

549
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:25,650
那不是黑人腔调 的确不是黑人腔调
It's not a black voice. In actuality, not a black voice.

550
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,270
不 你用了黑人腔调
No, you do a black voice.

551
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,780
你不记得你那次参加会议的时候了?
You don't remember when you was in that meeting?

552
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,440
你说 “讨论火起来 会议火起来”
You was like, "We gonna get it lit up in here. This meeting lit."

553
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:32,610
的确很火热
It was very lit.

554
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,410
你在员工会议上也那样说
You did it at the staff meeting,

555
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,240
你当时说 “我坦诚相告”
when you were like, "I keep it 100."

556
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:37,700
我什么时候没坦诚过?
When have I never kept it 100?

557
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,790
当你把AP微积分加到我的课程里
When you added that AP Calculus to my class load.

558
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,080
好了 求同存异
All right. Agree to disagree.

559
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,580
听着 我不想破坏这瞎想的自娱自乐
Listen, I hate to break up this pleasure party of delusion.

560
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:47,090
但我有工作要做
But I have work to do.

561
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,130
- 哇哦  - 所以如果你们理解...
- Wow. - So if you'll excuse me...

562
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:52,720
我要去做我的事了
I'mma do my thing.

563
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,680
那是黑人腔调
That's a black voice.

564
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,850
活跃起来 孩子们
Look alive, people.

565
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,980
保持劲头 出发 出发 出发!
Move with purpose. Go, go, go, go!

566
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,430
嘿 别在我的走廊闲逛
Hey. No loitering in my hall.

567
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,310
嘿 他真的能这样做吗? 他可以阻止我来这儿吗?
Hey, can he really do that? Can he keep me from going here?

568
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,770
不 他不能 事实上 这是你的教材
No, he can't. As a matter of fact, here's a textbook.

569
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,860
我现在正准备上课
I'm actually going to set up the class right now

570
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,150
我们这学期的第一章 我们7点开始
for our first session of the semester. We start at 7:00.

571
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,030
是吗 但这本书有点厚
Yeah, but this book is just kind of thick.

572
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,870
我以为一张讲义就够了
I thought it'd be more like a leaflet.

573
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:26,120
你觉得可以把四年的高中内容塞进一张讲义里?
You thought you could cram four years of high school into a leaflet?

574
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:27,290
不
No.

575
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,420
- 也许你就像斯图尔特说的那样愚蠢  - 等等 不 不 不
- Maybe you are as dumb as Stewart says. - Wait. No, no, no.

576
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,590
- 给我那个  - 不 我没那么想
- Give me that. - No, I didn't think that.

577
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,960
那就去图书馆
Go to the library then.

578
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:34,170
- 你个干瘦小矮子!   - 我会坚持下去的
- You little scrawny midget! - I'll hold on to it.

579
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:38,590
我搞混了 我想成了驾校
I'm trippin'. I'm thinking along the lines of traffic school.

580
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,810
瞧 你来不来我无所谓
Look, come or not, makes me no difference.

581
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,220
我不按人数拿薪
I don't get paid by the head.

582
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:46,350
也许你可以找一所用讲义的夜校
Or maybe you can find a night school that does teach from a leaflet.

583
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:49,520
- 你知道哪里...  - 不 不 我要留着它
- You know of one that... No, no. I'mma keep it.

584
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,400
祝你美好的一天
Have a good one.

585
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:55,320
马文 我不知道高中毕业证的事
Marv, I do not know about this GED thing.

586
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,070
我没有 伙计 这个老师太严厉了
I don't, man. The teacher is tough as hell.

587
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,200
稍等 马文 回聊 呦! 哦 该死!
Hold on. Marv, let me hit you back. Yo! Oh, shit!

588
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:04,040
等等! 停下 停下! 你在干什么?
Hold up! Stop, stop! What you doing?

589
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,200
看起来我在做什么?
What does it look like I'm doin'?

590
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:08,710
看起来你要拖我的车 我占用残疾人车位了吗?
It look like you towing my car. Did I park in the handicap spot?

591
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,590
你没偿付这辆车最后四笔还款
You've missed the last four payments on that car.

592
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,670
它被质押了
It's gettin' repossessed.

593
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,550
你要连我车里的孩子一起带走?
You gonna take my car with my baby in the back?

594
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,590
我没看到什么该死的孩子
I don't see no goddamn baby in there.

595
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:16,760
孩子就在那儿!
The baby right there!

596
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,970
你听不到吗?
You don't hear that?

597
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,180
我不这么认为
I don't think so.

598
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,680
嗨 老兄! 我说不要这样做
Hey, man! I said don't do it.

599
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,560
我没有开玩笑
I'm not playin'.

600
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,440
闪开吧 老兄!
Get out the way, dude!

601
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,480
停下 伙计! 我孩子在车上!
Stop, man! I got my baby in here!

602
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,770
车要走了
The car is leaving.

603
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,650
- 让开 老兄! 别闹了  - 我来告诉你怎么走
- Get out the way, dude! Come on, man. - I'll show you leaving.

604
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:33,730
我要给你点颜色看看
I've got something for your ass.

605
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,150
下车
Get out the car.

606
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,610
耶!
Yeah!

607
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,580
- 你想玩是吗?  - 是啊!
- You wanna play that game? - Yeah!

608
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,330
- 你想见识见识?  - 来吧 来啊!
- You wanna see something? - Come on, now!

609
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,040
再见!
Bye!

610
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,750
笨蛋
Dumbass.

611
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,130
谢谢观看
Glad y'all enjoyed the show.

612
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:59,840
告诉我未婚妻 我又出意外了
Tell my fiancée I got in another accident.

613
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,140
- 凯瑞 对吗?  - 哦...
- Carrie, right? - Oh...

614
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,270
所以即便教材那么厚 你也决定来参加
So even though we got textbook-sized textbooks, you decided to join us.

615
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,900
很好 找个座位吧 我们很快开始了
Well, grab a seat. We'll get started in a few.

616
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,990
好的 在这之前...
Okay, before I do that...

617
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,860
我知道我们初遇并不愉快 所以我在想
Now, I know we got off on the wrong foot, so I was thinking,

618
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:24,030
我不知道你有没有吃晚饭
I didn't know if you had time for dinner or not

619
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,160
不过我自作主张
so I took it upon myself

620
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,250
为你准备了我的最爱之一
to go and get you one of my personal favorites.

621
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,580
这是美国最好的墨西哥餐
It's the best Mexican here in the A.

622
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:34,090
哦 谢谢你 真是太体贴了 泰迪
Oh. Thank you. That is so thoughtful of you, Teddy.

623
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,460
直说吧
So check this out.

624
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:39,090
我查过你高中的记录
I went through some of your old high school records.

625
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:43,390
数学 科学 英语 你是个很糟的学生
Math, Science, English. You was a horrible student.

626
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:46,310
你那时怎么了? 你被虐待了还是什么?
What was going on with you then? Was you being abused or something?

627
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,140
凯瑞 我这个人喜欢以世界为师
Carrie, the thing with me is, I prefer to use the world as my classroom.

628
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,890
说实话
And to be honest with you,

629
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,820
我跟其他人不一样
I'm not like the rest of these folks.

630
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,860
我不是那种你认为的“夜校学生”
I'm just not what you would call a "night school person."

631
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,200
所以我想 也许你和我可以互相帮衬
So I figure, maybe you and I can look out for one another.

632
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,820
你帮我 我帮你
You help me, I help you.

633
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,490
你挺我 我挺你
You got my back, I got your back.

634
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,450
别担心 只是聊聊
Whatever. But it's just a conversation.

635
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,000
享用你的炸玉米饼 那感觉可以照亮整个房间 不是吗?
Enjoy your tacos. That smile can light up a room, can't it?

636
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,460
我不坐那儿
I ain't going there.

637
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:37,940
还记得我吗 混蛋?
Remember me, pendejo?

638
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,700
不记得麦基餐馆了?
Well, if it isn't Puby McGee.

639
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,370
芝士阴毛蛋糕的制造者?
The cheesecake puber is here?

640
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,120
见到我高兴吧 兄弟?
Surprised to see me, bro?

641
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,870
你不该 因为你让我被解雇了
You shouldn't be, considering that you got me fired.

642
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,750
我没有让你被解雇
I did not get you fired.

643
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,830
是的 是你
Yes, you did.

644
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,630
我在客户服务部工作了很长时间
I worked in customer service for a long time.

645
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:59,670
每个人都知道顾客是上帝
Everybody knows that the customer's always right.

646
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,340
- 我靠小费生活  - 我给了你20美元
- Tips are my livelihood. - I had a 20 coming your way.

647
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,970
账单是800美元
The bill was $800.

648
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:07,350
- 我应该有160美元 伙计!  - 好了 那是你的错!
- I had a buck sixty coming to me, man! - Okay. That's your fault!

649
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:10,510
好的 我们开始吧 这里谁喜欢炸玉米饼?
Okay, let's begin. Who here likes tacos?

650
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,600
哦! 哦! 哦! 哦
Oh! Oh! Oh! Ooh.

651
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,190
他们吃素?
They vegetarian?

652
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,980
因为除了烧烤 我不吃肉
'Cause I don't eat meat unless it's barbecue.

653
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,810
让我们看看泰迪给我们带来了什么
Let's see what Teddy brought us.

654
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,030
我们有牛排 给你
We got a carne asada. There you go.

655
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,690
有烤肉
There's al pastor.

656
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,200
- 哦 谢谢  - 喜欢吗?
- Oh, thanks. - You like that?

657
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,740
炖肉? 你喜欢炖肉吗? 给你 姑娘
Carnitas? You like carnitas? There you go, girl.

658
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,540
抱歉 凯瑞 实际上这些玉米饼是给你吃的
Excuse me, Carrie. I had actually got those tacos for you to eat.

659
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,830
我知道
I know.

660
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:38,750
看 同学们 泰迪去“仙人掌房子”（墨西哥餐厅）想要讨好我
See, class, Teddy went to Cactus House to try to win me over.

661
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,920
但事实是 泰迪 如果你想跟我套近乎
But here's the deal, Teddy. If you're trying to kiss my ass,

662
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,590
你还得再努力点
you're gonna have to come a little bit better than that.

663
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:47,680
我说的是 蒸龙虾配上空心粉和奶酪
I'm talking, like, steamed lobster inside of macaroni and cheese

664
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,550
再加一点西兰花
with a side of broccolini.

665
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,390
你知道我说的什么? 美味的东西!
You know what I'm saying? Somethin' fancy!

666
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:53,930
不是这种不知名的快餐店
Not no fast food place where I could go buy this

667
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,520
用我的薪水就可以负担起的
with my own little raggedy paycheck.

668
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:59,520
实际还有一种特殊的鳄梨酱...
Well, there's actually a special guacamole...

669
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:03,190
如果你想在我的课上取得成功
If you wanna succeed in my class,

670
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,740
你就认真学习 就这么简单
you need to do the work. It's just that simple.

671
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,360
- 问题?  - 问一下
- Yes? - Quick question.

672
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:10,030
蒸龙虾几分熟?
So "yes" on the steamed lobster?

673
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,580
不 先生 我只是打个比方
No, sir. That's what I like to call a teachable moment.

674
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,830
好的 所以没有龙虾
Okay, so no lobster.

675
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:20,420
好了 我们继续 先介绍一下
All right, let's go ahead and do some introductions.

676
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,590
从我开始
I'll start.

677
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:22,880
我叫凯瑞
My name is Carrie.

678
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,010
在白天 我教太多的课
During the day, I teach way too many classes

679
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,380
但是给太少的钱
for way too little money.

680
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:29,090
所以我在这里挣点外快
So I'm here to try to make a little extra cash,

681
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:33,810
所以我可以负担租金和抗生素这样的奢侈品
so I can afford such luxuries as rent and antibiotics

682
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:36,890
因为这工作有时让我生病
'cause this job makes me sick sometimes.

683
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,480
你是下一个 是的 你
You're next. Yes, you.

684
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,900
还好吗? 我叫杰伦
What up, though? Jaylen's the name.

685
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:49,820
我在麦克阿瑟装瓶厂工作了14年
I've been working for the last 14 years at the MacArthur bottling plant

686
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,620
然后被机器人取代了
and just got replaced by a robot.

687
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:56,450
我的心肝 我的女神 我的女王 我胯下的婊子
And my rib, my Cleopatra, my queen, my bottom bitch,

688
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,170
我结婚14年的妻子 她说
my wife of 14 years, she was like,

689
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:02,080
“哟 你有两个选择 要么拿到高中毕业证
"Yo, if you want options, you gonna have to get your GED.

690
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:05,710
“要么下半辈子在贝斯特韦斯特酒店打扫房间 薪水少了一半”
"It's either that or end up cleaning rooms at the Best Western for half your salary."

691
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,260
就算你认识杰伊也不行
And if you know Jay, that ain't gonna work.

692
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:13,020
嘿 这么说吧 当我到工厂的时候
Hey, let me just say this, okay, while I got the platform.

693
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,270
我想起了《终结者》的场景
For me, I first got woke when I seen Terminator.

694
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,980
我意识到那不仅仅是一部电影
And I realized it wasn't just a movie.

695
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,810
那是预言
It was prophecy.

696
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:26,610
先识别3.5个百分点 不过那是另一回事
First identified by the 3.5 percenters, but that's another conversation.

697
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,280
我们这么说吧
Let's just put it like this.

698
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,650
革命不会被机器化
The revolution will not be roboticized.

699
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,620
杰伊不是这么想的
Not on Jay's watch.

700
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,540
真正的黑鬼狗屎
Real nigga shit.

701
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,500
- 什么?  - 谢谢你 杰伦
- What? - Thank you, Jaylen.

702
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,080
我保证不会把我的扫地机器人带来课堂
I'll make sure I don't bring my Roomba to the next class.

703
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,670
我妻子参加伦巴舞班
My wife take rumba classes.

704
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,920
但我不懂
I don't get it.

705
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,210
我们继续吧
Let's keep it moving.

706
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,800
你呢 女士? 是的
How about you, ma'am? Yeah.

707
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,800
哦 好的
Oh. Okay.

708
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,510
嗨 伙计们 我叫特蕾莎
Hi, gang. My name is Theresa,

709
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:55,300
当我怀上第一个孩子时 我从高中辍学了
and I dropped out of high school when I was pregnant with my first child.

710
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,140
我现在的丈夫兰迪
My now-husband, Randy,

711
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:00,600
怀孕后我们结婚了 然后我们又有了两个孩子
we got married after he knocked me up, then we had two more kids.

712
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,810
所以我们现在有三个小坏蛋 很有趣
So we have three little rascals now, and it's fun.

713
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,560
我们现在有点资不抵债
We're just a little underwater right now,

714
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:07,480
所以我想拿到高中毕业证 希望找份工作
so I wanted to get my GED and, hopefully, enter the workforce.

715
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:11,030
希望还来得及 不然我们只能住在兰迪父母的洗衣房里了
Before it's too late and we have to live in Randy's parents' laundry room.

716
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:20,500
我很幸运 太有福了!
I'm blessed. So blessed!

717
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,210
上帝是仁慈的
God is good.

718
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,210
就是这样
That's what's up.

719
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,040
- 你呢 年轻的女士?  - 哦
- How about you, young lady? - Oh.

720
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,590
嘿 还好吗? 我是米拉
Hey, what's up? I'm Mila.

721
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,050
我被赶出了高中
I got kicked out of my high school

722
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:32,930
因为他们在我的储物柜里发现了一些摇头丸
because they found some Molly in my locker

723
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:35,930
如果我能拿到毕业证 就不用去少管所了
and I can avoid juvie if I get my GED.

724
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:38,220
所以我来了 我很兴奋
So here I am. I'm so psyched.

725
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,430
酷!
Cool!

726
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,560
看看你们 都很可爱 让美国再次伟大
Look at you, all cute, making America great again.

727
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,020
贱人

728
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,690
你的故事呢 伙计?
So what's your story, guy?

729
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:50,990
我叫路易斯·弗洛雷斯 我曾有一份很棒的服务员工作
My name is Luis Flores. I had a great job as a waiter.

730
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,950
拿很多小费
A lot of money in tips

731
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,700
直到我无故被炒
until I was fired without cause.

732
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,410
完全没有理由
No reason at all.

733
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:58,740
被解雇
Fired.

734
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:03,620
我不知道为什么 我不知道他为什么要看着我
I don't know why. I have no idea why he's lookin' at me.

735
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,120
没事
It's fine.

736
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:07,880
这只是一个标志 现在是时候做一些与众不同的事了
It's just a sign that it's time for me to do something different.

737
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,590
你看 我是从墨西哥来到这个国家
You see, I came to this country from Mexico

738
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,510
实现我成为一名创作歌手的梦想
to fulfill my dream of being a singer-songwriter.

739
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,180
哦 就像胡里奥·伊格莱西亚斯?
Oh, like Julio Iglesias?

740
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,760
不 不是胡里奥·伊格莱西亚斯
No, not like Julio Iglesias.

741
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,390
他糟透了
He sucks.

744
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,560
等等 等等 等等
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

745
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:30,570
你现在当流行歌星不是有点老吗?
Aren't you a little old to be a pop star now?

746
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:32,590
你现在就死不是有点太年轻吗?
Aren't you a little young to die?

747
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,200
就是这样
That's what's up.

748
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,780
但现在我将成为一名牙科保健员
But now I'm going to become a dental hygienist.

749
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,990
因为我的牙齿很好
'Cause I have great teeth.

750
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,660
所以我觉得我天生的
So I think I'd be a natural.

751
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,040
- 什么?  - 牙科保健员
- A what? - Dental hygienist.

752

753

继续
Go on.

766
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:31,130
好吧 无论如何 我的躯体很健壮
Well, anyway, my knees and my back are really jacked up

767
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,800
在河马搬家公司工作了30年
from working at He-Man Movers for 30 years.

768
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,630
所以我决定拿到我高中毕业证
So I decided to get my GED

769
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,970
这样我就可以升任管理职位了

770
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,300
摆脱掉卡车

772
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,810
所以我与他达成协议
So I made a deal with him.

773
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:48,850
我拿到我的高中毕业证 他拿到他的文凭
I get my GED, he gets his diploma.

774
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,940

It's like they watchin' you and you think you watchin' them!

噢 孩子 众人皆醉 众人皆醉
Ooh, boy, it's hard to be woke. It's hard to be woke.

We didn't meet everyone.

794
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,030
- 我没有...  - 泰迪
- I didn't... - Teddy.

795
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:45,160
早些时候 你说 与这些人不同 你不是一个夜校人
Earlier, you said, unlike these folks, you're not a night school type of person.

796
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,200
所以我不认为你在意
So I didn't think you cared.

797
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:50,000
是吗?
Is that right?

798
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:53,080
你听错了
You didn't hear it right,

799
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:56,090
因为我永远不会那样说我不认识的人
'cause I would never say that about people that I don't know.

800
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:57,880
你知道吗? 这是一个完美的接龙
You know what? This is a perfect segue.

801
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,800
我会跟随你的领导 我会站起来
I'll just follow your lead, and I'll stand up.

802
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:02,640
我是泰迪·沃克
I am Teddy Walker.

803
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,060
关于我的一个有趣事实是 我实际曾来过这里
A little fun fact about me, I actually went here.

804
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,350
- 哦  - 我现在也是新生
- Oh. - I'm also newly engaged.

805
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,140
他的未婚妻对他怀有二心
His fiancée is out of his league.

806
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,350
对不起 什么?
I'm sorry, what?

807
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,400
没事 你做的很棒 我说 “继续前进 每个人都爱你”
Nothing. You're doing great. I said, "Keep going. Everybody loves you."

808
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,230
你的未婚妻如何看待你在夜校上学?
How does your fiancée feel about you being in night school?

809
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,440
她很好!
She good!

810
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:20,650
她喜欢这样!
She loves it!

811
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,660
他屁都没给她说
He ain't told her shit.

812
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,910
她喜欢这样!
She loves it!

813
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:26,870
我注意到你的声音刚刚上升了整整八度
I noticed that your voice just went up a whole octave.

814
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:30,540
现在 根据我在研究生院的心理研究
Now, from my studies of psychology in grad school,

815
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:33,170
我知道那意味着你在胡说八道
I know that that means that you're bullshitting.

816
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,960
我从来不乱讲
Ain't no bullshit in me.

817
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,660
我告诉你 如果你睡了她 就不要骗她
I tell you what, if you're lying with her, don't lie to her.

818
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:38,870
但我不骗人
But I don't lie.

819
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,420
听起来就是胡扯
Sound like some bullshit to me.

820
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,880
- 每个人都能看穿你  - 好吧 我们...
- Everyone sees right through you. - Okay, how about we...

821
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,250
按照你的理论 关于声音...
If we go by your theory, about the voice thing...

822
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,050
我想我们都跑题了
I think that we're all gettin' off track.

823
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,130
他说了四次谎了
He's lied four times.

824
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,510
- 这男孩绝对在撒谎  - 我没有
- This boy definitely lying. - I am not.

825
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:53,600
你不能违背自然 女人就是自然
You can't outsmart Mother Nature. And that's what a woman is.

826
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,310
- 老兄  - 尤其是黑人女性
- Brother. - Especially a black woman.

827
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,680
没错
That's correct.

828
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:57,980
- 女孩们很聪明 老兄  - 她漂亮吗?
- Girls are smart, dude. - Is she pretty?

829
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,730
该死 看我的口型 该死
God damn it. Like, literally, damn it.

830
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,600
- 即使他没有告诉她 那又怎样?  - 好了 现在是...
- Even if he didn't tell her, so what? - Okay, here's the thing...

831
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:04,440
我告诉兰迪 他是我的第一个男人 其实不是
I told Randy that he was the first guy I slept with. Not true.

832
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,150
我只是想介绍一下自己...
I'm trying to introduce myself...

833
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,780
你不尊重你的女王
You don't respect your queen,

834
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,280
因为如果你尊重 那个婊子该知道你在哪里
'cause if you did, that bitch would know where you at.

835
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,240
好了 泰迪 不要骗你的女王
Okay. Teddy. Don't lie to your queen.

836
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,320
好吧 伙计们
Okay, guys.

837
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:14,620
如果你像这样让她伤心
If you're busting off in her guts like that,

838
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,910
她可能怀着你的孩子
she might be carrying your seed.

839
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,160
我觉得这次谈话...
I feel like this conversation's...

840
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,750
所以你不只是对她说谎 你也向你的孩子说谎
So you ain't just lyin' to her. You lyin' to your child.

841
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:19,870
见鬼!
Shit!

842
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,920
如果她是你胯下的婊子 她知道你傻 老铁
If it's your bottom bitch, she know you stupid, fam.

843
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,040
- 我想说的是…  - 算了
- All I'm sayin', fam... - Forget it.

844
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,170
好的!
Okay!

845
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:26,550
你的未婚妻怎会不知道你在哪? 天已经黑了
How your fiancée don't know where you at? It's after dark.

846
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:28,510
- 这不是万圣节 农夫  - 我说完了
- This ain't Halloween, fam. - I'm done.

847
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,250
我妹妹都知道我在哪里 好吗?
My sister know where I'm at. Okay?

848
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,300
她一直住在阿肯色州
And she live all the way in Arkansas.

849
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,710
好了 同学们 听我说
Okay, here's the deal, class.

850
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:40,260
每天晚上都会给你们留作业 就像普通高中一样
You will be given homework every night, just like regular high school.

851
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,140
现在 一个临时测验
And now, a pop quiz

852
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,640
这样我就可以更好地了解你们的水平
just so I can get a better idea of where you all are.

853
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,770
等等 我们第一天就有测试?
Wait, we got a test on the first day?

854
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:53,110
泰迪 这是临时测验 好吗? 听着 伙计们
Teddy, it's a pop quiz. Okay? Look here, folks.

855
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:56,440
只要你们在这就得听我的
I am here to teach if you're here to learn.

856
00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:00,200
否则 你们现在就可以离开我的班级
Otherwise, you can get outta my class right now.

857
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,160
就是这样
That's what's up.

858
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,370
欢迎来到夜校
Welcome to night school.

859
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,540
你的
There you go.

860
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,540
太可怕了 伙计! 可怕!
It was terrible, man! Terrible!

861
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:14,170
她不像我们以前的老师
Like, she's not like the teachers that we had back in the day.

862
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,210
- 什么?  - 这女人就是一堵墙
- What? - This woman is a brick wall.

863
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,670
我搞不定她
And I can't work her.

864
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,930
我不能搞定一堵墙
I can't work a brick wall.

865
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,140
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

866
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,050
我在健身 我要减肥
I'm working out. I'm trying to shed some Ib's.

867
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,390
- 我想要好身材  - 我为什么要问呢?
- I wanna feel fit. - Why am I even asking?

868
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,600
在此期间 别再乱花钱了
In the meantime, please stop paying for everything

869
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:29,850
你必须找到一份临时工作
and you have to get a temp job.

870
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,810
你不觉得我一直在找吗?
You don't think I've been looking for a job?

871
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,900
你疯了吗? 我在跑步机上!
What are you, crazy? I'm on a treadmill!

872
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,480
我想要的工作
The jobs that I want,

873
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:39,320
不会给一个高中辍学生
they are not going to give to a high school dropout.

874
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:42,570
好吧 你不能一直对丽莎撒谎 好吗? 你知道吗?
Well, you can't keep lying to Lisa. Okay? You know what?

875
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,330
我现在就去智联看看 有什么新工作吗
I'm gonna go on Monster. com right now, see if anything new popped up.

876
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,830
你能在智联上找到什么?
What are you gonna find on Monster. com?

877
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,620
哦 哦 哦 好的 这个
Ooh, ooh, ooh. Okay, here we go.

878
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:51,830
“招聘销售助理 具备营销技巧”
"Sales associate wanted, marketing skills a must,"

879
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,710
而且 等等  “不要高中毕业证”
and, wait for it, "no GED required."

880
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,010
你必须试试这个 伙计! 太棒了!
You gotta jump on this, man! This is perfect!

881
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,900
此鸡由主赐
It's chicken from the Lord.

882
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,440
所以是上帝做的?
So he made it?

883
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,200
是的 先生 他做的
Yes, sir, he did.

884
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,820
是啊
Yeah.

885
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,700
我可以干这样的工作
I can work with this.

886
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,870
- 你可以?  - 是啊
- You can? - Yeah.

887
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,410
基本上 你想要什么
Basically, what you wanna do,

888
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,790
你想提升顾客的品味
you wanna uplift your customers' palate.

889
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:32,920
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

890
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,210
当他们吃你的食物
When they bite into your food,

891
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:37,590
你想让他们的味蕾尖叫出“哈利路亚”
you want their taste buds to scream out "Hallelujah! "

892
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:40,220
没错 泰迪兄弟 你真是天才
Preach it, Brother Teddy. You are a godsend.

893
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,010
我是推销员 伙计 我是专业的 好吗?
I'm a salesman, man. That's what I do, okay?

894
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,430
现在 谈到头衔 我其实不关心
Now, when it comes to titles, I don't even care.

895
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,180
营销总监? 随你
Marketing director? That's up to you.

896
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,770
想想看 此时此刻 “耶稣会做什么?”
WWJD, at this point."What Would Jesus Do?"

897
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:51,180
- 我想问一件事...  - 没错 先生
- The one thing that I ask... - Yes, sir.

898
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:52,520
就是灵活的工作时间
Is for you to flexible with the hours.

899
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,100
因为我在准备高中毕业证
'Cause I'm getting my GED.

900
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,400
你在不断进取 泰迪兄弟
You are bettering yourself, Brother Teddy.

901
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,520
是啊
Yeah.

902
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:58,020
这就是基督徒的意义所在
That's what being a Christian is all about.

903
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,820
是的 阿门
Yeah, amen to that.

904
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,490
- 阿门!  - 是啊
- Amen! - Yeah.

905
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:02,570
圣光与你同在!
Glory be!

906
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,110
这应该完全适合你
This should fit you perfectly.

907
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,120
泰迪兄弟 我一直在等待上帝显灵
Brother Teddy, I have been waiting on the Lord

908
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,410
给我带来一个像你一样的小个子来穿这个
to bring me a pint-sized little man like you to fill this out.

909
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,580
现在你来了
And here you are.

910
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,710
我不会那样做的
I'm not gonna do that.

911
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,630
艾萨克兄弟 我是个黑人
Brother Isaac, I'm a black man.

912
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:23,880
我不能在2018年了还穿上鸡套装
I can't put on a chicken suit in 2018

913
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:28,760
站在高速公路旁边 装作该死的鸡
and stand on the side of a highway and hawk no goddamn chicken.

914
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:31,100
现在 如果营销职位不是你的想法
Now, if the marketing position isn't what you had in mind,

915
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,970
我们可以... 发生了什么?
we can figure... What is going on?

916
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,890
你知道吗? 我们回头再说
You know what? We're gonna have to put a pin in that.

917
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,940
是消防演习吗? 好的 伙计们
Is that a fire drill? All right, everybody.

918
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,480
都聚过来 我们要赶时间
Let's gather 'round. The hour's upon us.

919
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,560
最近的出口在哪里?
Where's the closest exit?

920
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,610
- 现在是祷告时间  - 现在是什么?
- It is time to pray. - It's time to what?

921
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,530
祷告时间 围成圈
It's time to pray. Gather 'round.

922
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,360
该死 你搞什么?
Goddamn. What's your deal?

923
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,280
- 嘿 女士  - 亲爱的主
- Hey, lady. - Dear Lord,

924
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,030
我们感谢你今天早上给我们带来了小泰迪

925
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,580
- 是的 先生!  - 这个小山雀
- Yes, sir!  - This little chickadee

926
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,580
将为世界分享你珍贵的家禽
is gonna share the word about your precious poultry with the world.

927
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:58,170
我不会做的... 女士! 女士!
What I'm not gonna do is do it in... Ma'am! Ma'am!

928
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,960
手劲真大!
Strong hands!

929
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,420
抱歉!
Excuse me!

930
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,590
我不会在鸡里做... 该死!
What I'm not gonna do is do it in a chicken... Goddamn!

931
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,760
泰迪兄弟
Brother Teddy.

932
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,180
他在你心里 他在你心里 不是吗?
He's in you. He's in you, ain't he?

933
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,430
无论是否装鸡
Chicken suit or not,

934
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,300
我们现在都在一起祈祷
we are all praying together right now

935
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:13,310
你今天会在这里找到自己的窝
that you're gonna find your nest here with us today.

936
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:15,600
- 好吧  - 阿门! 阿门
- Okay. - Amen! And Amen.

937
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,100
阿门!
Amen!

938
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,900
阿门! 是的 先生! 欢迎 泰迪兄弟
Amen! Yes, sir! Welcome, Brother Teddy.

939
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,650
好了 伙计们 这是一个重要的日子
All right, everybody. This is a big day.

940
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,770
嘿 兄弟 让我叫醒你
Hey, brother, let me holler at you real quick.

941
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,900
你们都被洗脑了吗?
Are y'all in the Sunken Place?

942
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,820
让我们通过食物感受耶稣的爱吧!
Let's share Jesus through our food. Let's go!

943
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,450
午餐高峰快到了
The lunch rush is upon us.

944
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,780
什么 午餐高峰? 现在是上午10点
What, lunch rush? It's 10:00 a.m.

945
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,030
我不明白这怎么可能被认为是午餐高峰
I don't understand how that could be considered a lunch rush.

946
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,660
相信我 泰迪兄弟
Trust me, Brother Teddy.

947
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:38,120
好吧 如果有... 如果有任何可能我想跟你谈谈...
Okay. If there... If there's any way that I can just talk to you about...

948
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,710
早安 女士们
Good morning, ladies.

949
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,250
你好 茜娜蒙 罗克珊

你们好 女士们 换班顺利吗?
Hello, ladies. How was the shift?

951
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:46,510

953
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:50,300

954
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:52,510
罗克茜 很高兴见到你
Roxy. Good to see you.

955
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,850
好啦
All right, then.

956
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,930
14.99美元 你想怎么支付?
That'll be $14.99. How would you like to pay?

957
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,440
通过你们第一晚的作业
Now, from your first night of homework,

958
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,650
你们都应该对毕达哥拉斯(勾股定理)非常熟悉了
you all should be very familiar with the Pythagorean theorem.

959
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:08,900
对吧? 跟我说
All right? Say it with me.

960
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:09,990
“毕达哥拉斯”
"Pythagorean."

961
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,160
- “毕达哥拉斯定理” - “毕达哥拉理”
- "Pythagorean theorem." - "Pythagorium."

962
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,280
“毕达哥拉率”
"Pythigorinian."

963
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:13,490
- “定理”  - “定理”
- "Theorem." - "Theorem."

964
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,620
“定理”
"Theorem."

965
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,740
就是你们说的 就是这样
That's how you say it. That's what it is.

966
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,410
嘿 哟! 鲍比 小心 农夫!
Hey, yo! Bobby, watch out, fam!

967
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,580
天啊
My God.

968
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,210
抓住他!
Get him!

969
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,880
哦! 哦!
Oh! Oh!

970
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,840
鲍比有本事
Bobby got skills.

971
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,380
哦!
Oh!

972
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,630
- 该死!  - 你没看到我正在学习吗?
- Shit! - Can't you see I'm tryin' to learn?

973
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,380
有人应该叫警察!
Someone ought to call the cops!

974
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:31,720
怎么了?
What's happening?

975
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,390
主啊! 放开我! 放开我!
Jesus! Get off me! Get off me!

976
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:38,640
他起来了! 他起来了!
He's gettin' up! He's gettin' up!

977
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,180
小心 农夫! 在你身后 黑鬼!
Watch out, fam! Behind you, nigga!

978
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:44,230
- 他踢中了...  - 哦 天啊!
- He just kicked him in the... - Oh, my God!

979
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:45,520
就在...
Right in the...

980
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:50,650
够了! 终结他! 踩爆他的头!
Enough! Finish him! Step on his head!

981
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:53,530
- 过来! 过来!  - 放手!
- Come here! Come on! - Break it up!

982
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:57,080
- 拜托!  - 嗨 伙计!
- Come on! - Hey, man!

983
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,160
我什么都没干!
I didn't do shit!

984
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:02,040
就是这种东西 让我想起过去的日子
That's the stuff right there. Reminds me of the old days.

985
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:08,300
他们认错人了 请继续吧
They had the wrong guy. Please continue.

986
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,670
你确定你没事 或者我们冷静一下
You sure you cool, or do we need to just chill

987
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,220
等你缓缓神?
and wait for you to make a new shank?

988
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:17,300
请继续“毕达哥拉斯定理”
Please continue with the Pythagorean theorium.

989
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,180
好的
Okay.

990
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:21,430
你们知道我们该为鲍比做些什么吗?
You know what we ought to do for Bobby?

991
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:23,720
我们应该给他些 比如香烟
We should get him, like, some smokes.

992
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,470
因为那些东西就像监狱中的货币
'Cause that stuff is like currency in prison.

993
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,730
香烟和后庭
That and ass.

994
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:27,980
好了 我们继续吧
Okay, here we go.

995
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:30,650
所以 这就是我们所说的直角三角形
So, this is what we call a right triangle.

996
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:34,270
我们已经知道了三角形两条边的长度
And we already know the value of two sides of the triangle.

997
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:39,280
这可以让我们很容易计算斜边的长度
That should make it very easy for us to calculate the hypotenuse.

998
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:43,370
a方加b方等于c方
A- squared plus b-squared equals c-squared.

999
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:44,700
跟我念 伙计们
Say that with me, guys.

1000
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:49,790
“a方加b方等于c方”
"A-squared plus b-squared equals c-squared."

1001
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:51,040
很好
Very good.

1002
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,420
泰迪 你似乎已经会了
Teddy, you seem to be getting a real kick out of this.

1003
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,460
她抓到了你 泰迪!
She got you, Teddy!

1004
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,630
你想上来做这个题吗?
You wanna come up and solve the problem?

1005
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,300
被抓现行!
Busted!

1006
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:05,930
如果那是… 你想要我做的
If that's what you want me to do.

1007
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,180
来吧
Come on up.

1008
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,060
来吧 泰迪 你可以的
Come on, Teddy, you got this.

1009
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:12,810
你可以的 泰迪 泰迪! 泰迪! 泰迪!
You got this, Teddy. Teddy! Teddy! Teddy!

1010
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,360
泰迪! 泰迪! 泰迪!
Teddy! Teddy! Teddy!

1011
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,910
求“c”的值
Find the value of "c."

1012
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:39,340
你们知道吗?
You know what?

1013
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,180
我觉得这里有一些东西
I think there's something in here.

1014
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:50,230
呦 呦 呦! 还好吗 我的夜校?
Yo, yo, yo! What up, my night school?

1015
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,850
你在找谁 农夫?
Who you lookin' for, fam?

1016
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:58,480
我是这所高中的校长 我只是顺道看看...
I am the principal of this high school. And I'm just dropping by to check on...

1017
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:01,400
他在这做什么?
What is he doing here?

1018
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,530
我在学习 拿毕业证 跟其他人一样
I'm studying to get my GED like everybody else.

1019
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:08,700
所以 如果你不介意的话 我想回去学习
So, if you don't mind, I'd like to get back to learning.

1020
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,080
当然
Of course.

1021
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:13,290
我为打断道歉
My apologies for interrupting.

1022
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:14,710
谢谢
Thank you.

1023
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,920
实际上 我想看一会儿 如果可以的话
Actually, I would like to observe for a minute, if that's okay.

1024
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:23,050
请继续解题吧
Please, continue solving the problem.

1025
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:25,140
忘记我在这里
Forget I'm here.

1026
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,390
好啊
Cool.

1027
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,220
我无所谓
That's fine with me.

1028
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:33,440
好的 所以想解题 我们一步一步来
Okay, so if we're gonna do this, let's do it step by step.

1029
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,650
确保我们做得对
Let's make sure we do it right.

1030
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:37,150
首先 我们擦掉这条线
First things first, let's get rid of this line.

1031
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:39,900
因为它太潦草了
Because it's written sloppy.

1032
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,820
- 所以变整洁些  - 8!
- So let's get that baby neat. - Eight!

1033
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,360
对吧?
Right?

1034
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:45,990
我们有三条边a b c 分解这个
We got these three sides. Got a, b, c. Split that.

1035
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:48,410
这里 去掉这两个
That's there. Take these twos away.

1036
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:49,740
他不知道答案!
He don't know the answer!

1037
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,700
因为你不懂
Because that's what confuses you.

1038
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,790
然后
And then,

1039
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:56,420
- 你就看出来了 - 8!
- you're realizing what it is. - Eight!

1040
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,750
答案是5
The answer's five.

1041
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:03,010
是5 简单 好的 5的平方
It's five. Easy. Okay, you're looking at five squared.

1042
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:06,260
就讲到这里 我没时间 我没时间
Me up here, I don't have time. I don't have time.

1043
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:07,970
为什么要浪费我的时间?
Why do I even waste my time?

1044
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:09,720
我没有时间 不能浪费时间在勾股定理上
I don't got time to waste my time on the Pythagorean theorem.

1045
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:10,970
- 多简单  - 哇哦
- It's simple. - Wow.

1046
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:14,180
这真令人印象深刻 泰迪
That is very impressive, Teddy.

1047
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,940
非常深刻!
Very impressive!

1048
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,980
我期待看你期中的表现
I look forward to seeing how you do on the midterm.

1049
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,190
我主持的期中
My midterm.

1050
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,440
没问题
All right.

1051
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:24,990
说完了吗 斯图尔特?
Are we done here, Stewart?

1052
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:27,280
或者你想教剩下的课程吗?
Or do you wanna teach the rest of the class for the night?

1053
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:28,740
继续吧 凯瑞
Carry on, Carrie.

1054
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,780
我不喜欢他的态度
I don't like his attitude.

1055
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,410
祝你们上课愉快
You all have a wonderful class.

1056
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,500
什么?
What?

1057
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:39,170
天啊 那家伙真是神经质
God, that guy is a douchebag.

1058
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:43,420
我们是不是忘了刚刚还看过一场监狱斗殴?
Are we just gonna gloss over the fact that we just watched a prison fight?

1059
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:46,800
- 我们还剩多少课?  - 很奇怪 对吗?
- How many classes do we have left? - That was weird, right?

1060
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,470
我现在必须工作四个小时
I actually have to work for four hours right now.

1061
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,850
我不知道我是否愿意
I don't know if I'm into this.

1062
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:52,010
如果你愿意的话 10美元带你回家
I can give you a ride home for 10 bucks if you want.

1063
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,810
嘿 凯瑞! 嘿!
Hey, Carrie! Hey!

1064
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:57,980
上黑板的时候你为我做的真是太酷了
That was real cool, what you did for me in there at the blackboard.

1065
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,560
你知道 这就是我所说的
You know, that's what I was talking about

1066
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,730
互相照顾 对吧?
when I just said watchin' out for each other, you know?

1067
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,400
你罩着我 我罩着你
You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.

1068
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,610
不会再有了 泰迪
There's not gonna be any more back-scratching, Teddy.

1069
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,450
这是最后一次
That's the last time that happens.

1070
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:09,620
不过 你上黑板时怎么了?
And what was really going on with you at the board, anyways?

1071
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:11,620
没什么
Nothing.

1072
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:15,330
没事! 我只是... 我没准备好
Nothing! No, I was just... I wasn't prepared.

1073
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:17,330
如果你不打算上下去 就退课
If you're not gonna do the work, drop the class.

1074
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,120
你为什么要... 不 凯瑞! 嘿!
Why would you... No, Carrie! Hey!

1075
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:21,340
我会学 你会看到的
I'mma do the work. You'll see.

1076
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,170
- 走着瞧  - 是的 我们会
- We'll see. - Yes, we will.

1079
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:34,970
该死!
Shit!

1080
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:37,560
亲爱的 我回来了!
Honey, I'm home!

1081
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,520
你在睡觉吗?
You sleepin'?

1082
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,280
醒了?
You up?

1083
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,950
不好意思!
Excuse me!

1084
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,540
屁股很好看 不是吗?
Booty look good, don't it?

1085
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:04,170
很遗憾 你的脸要埋在书里而不是屁股里
Too bad your face gonna be in between them books and not them cheeks.

1086
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,050
去学习!

1087

我不想学习!
I don't wanna study!

1088
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,680
拜托 泰迪 集中注意力!
Come on, Teddy. Focus!

1089
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,100
专注 泰迪! 专注!
Focus, Teddy! Focus!

1090
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:26,110
你别想拿到!
You'll never get it!

1091
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,690
还给我!
Give me it back!

1092
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:29,990
嘿 伙计 这是我的演示

无论需要什么

1094
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:34,070
你知道我会继续战斗
You know I'm always gonna keep on fighting

1095
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:39,660
小麦克! 你在做什么?
Little Mac! What are you doing?

1096
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:40,960
这是我的手机 那是我的笔记
It's my phone. Those were my notes.

1097
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,920
- 你应该学习  - 干什么
- You should be studying. - What the hell?

1098
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,710
别这么混蛋!
Don't be such a dick!

1099
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:46,590
- 你要学习!  - 我恨你!
- You're gonna study! - I hate you!

1100
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:48,760
披萨的周长是多少?
What's the circumference of that pizza?

1101
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:49,880
直径?

告诉我披萨上有多少辣椒
Just tell me how many pepperonis are on the pizza.

1103
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,640
我要给你差评
I'm giving you one star.

1104
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:56,390
我把你扔在这个鬼地方 怎么样?
I'm gonna drop you off here in a bad neighborhood. How 'bout that?

1105
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,640

Theresa! It's after 10:00! Hello!

1106
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:02,720

That's my Randy. Sweetest guy on Earth.

1107
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:04,890
有没有其他人想尝试解这个题?
Does anybody else wanna try to take a crack at this?

1108
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:06,940
我现在很忙
I'm kinda busy right now.

1109
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,400
宝贝 你看到我的修正液了吗?

“肥臀”

1113
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,240
你知道什么样的人肥臀?
You know what fat asses like?

1114
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,160
有正式工作的人
Dudes that have a real job.

1115
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,490
- 泰迪!  - 滚出去
- Teddy! - Get your ass out.

1116
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:27,160
泰迪 如果你没有通过期中考试 家里就再没有女孩了
Teddy, if you don't pass that midterm, no way homegirl stays with you.

1117
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:30,330
好好想想吧
Think about that.

1118
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:31,880
我们不得不去偷卷子
We're gonna have to steal the test.

1119
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:35,670
英雄所见略同 我也在想这个事
Mind meld. I was thinking the exact same thing.

1120
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:38,880
如果我们真这么做 我需要很多帮助
If we being real with it, I need as much help as I can get.

1121
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:42,430
从卡宾瓶到斜边等等
Goin' from cappin' bottles to hypotenuses and all that,

1122
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:46,060
我和你们一样对这些感到困惑 理解吗?
I'm just as confounded by the materials as the rest of y'all. Feel me?

1123
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:49,940
我真的不愿承认 但沟通障碍
I really hate to admit it, but with the language barrier

1124
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,270
还有我的专车工作
and all the Lyft driving I've been doing,

1125
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,820
我也在苦苦挣扎 伙计们
I'm struggling as well, guys.

1126
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,190
我觉得这主意不错
I think a caper sounds fun.

1127
00:49:58,450 --> 00:49:59,740
你什么时候来的 特蕾莎?
When did you get here, Theresa?

1128
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:01,780
哦 我一直都在这里
Oh, I've been here the whole time.

1129
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,200
人们从不会注意到我 总是如此
People never notice me. It happens all the time.

1130
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:06,950
有点像超级英雄
It's kinda like a super power

1131
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,080
但是承受着无敌的孤独
but one that comes with a crushing loneliness.

1132
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:16,130
我很幸运 太有福了
I'm blessed. I'm so blessed.

1133
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:18,800
是的 上帝仁慈
Yeah, God is good.

1134
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:20,630
好的
Okay.

1135
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:23,010
米拉 你呢?
Mila, what about you?

1136
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:26,220
如果我再失败 我的父母会发飙的
My parents are gonna be really pissed if I get busted again.

1137
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:28,980

- 我加入 这就是我所说的!  - 好的
- I'm in. That's what I'm talkin' about! - All right.

1139
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,400
在这之前 我只有一个问题
I just have one question before we do this.

1140
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,730
什么?
What's up?

1141
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:36,070
为什么泰迪做领导 伙计们?
Why does Teddy get to be the ring leader, guys?

1142
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:37,650
- 拜托!  - 该死的 路易斯
- Come on! - God damn it, Luis.

1143
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:38,860
我说 你认真的 伙计?
I mean, seriously, man?

1144
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:41,860
这是他的主意 他比我们任何人都更了解学校
It was his idea. He knows the school better than any of us.

1145
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,410
可别忘了
Just never mind the fact

1146
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:47,870
我偷偷溜进一个叫做美国的小地方
that I snuck into a little place called America.

1147
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:51,210
没错! 路易斯今晚很牛!
That's true! Luis is hot tonight!

1148
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:29,240
- 哟 泰  - 什么?
- Yo, T. - What?

1149
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:32,500
我很感激你带的这份神奇 炽热的撒旦鸡丁
I appreciate you bringing this amazing, blazing, Satan chicken.

1150
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:34,170
它好像很火辣 虽然不是
It's like it's hot, but it's not.

1151
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:36,000
而且我不喜欢辛辣的食物 但是这个...
And I don't like spicy food, but this one...

1152
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:39,170
- 我告诉你还有什么上火  - 你的呼吸
- Let me tell you what else is hot. - Your breath.

1153
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,300
你为什么这样对着我的脸呼吸?
Why are you breathing on the side of my face like that?

1154
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:44,220
都吹我耳朵里了 伙计 停下
You smackin' all in my ear, man. Stop.

1155
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,100
你还在咂嘴 该死的 别吃了 别吃了
You still smacking. God damn it, you're done. You're done.

1156
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:51,640
你别吃了 认真的?
You're done with that. Really?

1157
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:55,310
- 天啊! 你有病吧 伙计?  - 什么?
- God! What is your problem, man? - What?

1158
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,020
我说穿全黑 你为什么不穿黑色?
I said wear all black. Why didn't you wear black?

1159
00:51:57,690 --> 00:51:59,860
洗衣日 我所有的深色衣服都洗了
Laundry day. All my darks were in the wash.

1160
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:01,110
所以你穿黄色?
So you wore yellow?

1161
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,570
这是新的 很干净
It's fresh. It's clean.

1162
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:04,530
把你的手从我脸上拿开
Get your arm out my face.

1163
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:05,950
从我脸上拿开
Get out of my face.

1164
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,580
集中注意力! 我们走吧!
Focus! Let's go! Let's go!

1165
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,000

Yo, Teddy, what's the play, man?

No, Bobby. He's not my inside man, he's the janitor.

向你们发誓 当我在这上学时
Swear to you, when I went to school here,

1447
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,700
楼似乎没这么高
that jump did not seem that high.

1448
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:18,070
我肯定做不到
There's no way I can make that.

1449
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,490
我只能跳 大概 3英尺!
I can jump, like, three feet!

1450
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:22,580
我的膝盖和背搬东西受过伤 泰迪!
My knees and my back are totally shot from moving boxes, Teddy!

1451
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:24,290
- 好了!  - 我们要做什么?
- All right! - What are we gonna do?

1452
01:04:24,370 --> 01:04:25,870
听着 听着 我知道了!
Listen, listen. I got it!

1453
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,290
我们就当它15英尺
Let's just say it's 15 feet.

1454
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:28,540
哦 天啊!
Oh, God!

1455
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:29,670
假设15英尺
Take that 15 feet,

1456
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:31,590
减去你可以跳的3英尺
minus the three feet that you can jump.

1457
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:33,010
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

1458
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:35,260
我们所要做的就是使用毕达哥拉斯定理
All we gotta do is use the Pythagorean theorem.

1459
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:37,800
没人上课听讲 没人知道怎么做!
Nobody was listening in class. Nobody knows how to do that!

1460
01:04:37,890 --> 01:04:39,180
不 等等 等等
No, wait, wait, wait.

1461
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:40,890
凯瑞说过 要使用毕达哥拉斯定理
Carrie said in order to use the Pythagorean theorem,

1462
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:42,510
你必须知道斜边
you have to know the hypotenuse.

1463
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,850
我们要做的就是算出斜边
All we gotta do is hypotenuse it.

1464
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:46,850
a方加b方等于c方
A- squared plus b-squared equals c-squared.

1465
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:48,310
如果你知道两条边
If you know two sides,

1466
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,110
就可以知道第三条 所以它大约是六英尺宽
that will help you figure out the third, so it's roughly six feet across.

1467
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:54,150
所以15的平方是225除以6的平方
So 15-squared is 225 divided by 6- squared.

1468
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,570
- 斜边!  - 等等 我刚刚说了什么?
- Hypotenuse it! - Wait, what did I just say?

1469
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:56,820
- 是36  - 是的 36
- It's 36. - Yeah. 36.

1470
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:57,950
但你没有除它 你加了它
But you don't divide it. You add it.

1471
01:04:58,030 --> 01:04:59,110
但是 那么 我刚刚说了什么?
But, then, what did I just say?

1472
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,070
- 她真是数学天才  - 15的平方 等等 不
- She's the best one at math. - 15-squared. Wait, no.

1473
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,410
- 斜边!  - 不 不 你可以这样做!
- Hypotenuse it! - No, no, you can do this!

1474
01:05:02,490 --> 01:05:03,490
6平方是...
6- squared is...

1475
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:04,580
- 我不知道  - 没有!
- I don't know. - No!

1476
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:05,750
不 加油 你可以的
No. Come on, you got this.

1477
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:08,460
哦 我的天!
Oh, my God!

1478
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:11,170
- 米拉!  - 哦 我的天!
- Mila! - Oh, my God!

1479
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:14,380
- 你没事吧?  - 伙计们!
- You all right? - Guys!

1480
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:15,840
这不是一个困难的数学问题
It's not a hard math problem.

1481
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,630
这是一个简单的物理问题 跳吧
It's a simple physics problem. Just jump.

1482
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,590
你知道斜边了?
Did you hypotenuse it?

1483
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,720
是的 我知道了
Yeah, I hypotenused it.

1484
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:23,850
你们能跳吗?
Can you just jump?

1485
01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:25,430
麦克 你下一个
Mac, you're up next.

1486
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,980
- 不 不  - 没错
- No. No. - Yes.

1487
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:28,310
麦克 不要这样
Mac, don't you give me that.

1488
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,650
好吗? 一提到“男人” 我就想到你
Okay? When I think "man," I think you.

1489
01:05:30,810 --> 01:05:33,860
我能想到小麦克会多么自豪
I think about how proud Little Mac must be.

1490
01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:36,900
我希望你做你最擅长的事情并且做得很好
I want you to do what you do best and go be great.

1491
01:05:37,610 --> 01:05:39,240
好的 是啊
Okay. Yeah.

1492
01:05:39,530 --> 01:05:40,990
跳过那个屋顶 麦克
Get across that roof, Mac.

1493
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:42,160
是! 好的!
Yeah! Okay!

1494
01:05:42,330 --> 01:05:43,580
- 好吗? 你可以的!  - 没问题!
- All right? You got this! - All right!

1495
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:45,540
麦克来了 退后一步
Mac comin' in. Step back.

1496
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:46,620
加油 麦克!
Let's go, Mac!

1497
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:47,700
谢谢你 泰迪
Thank you, Teddy.

1498
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:49,540
不客气
Any time.

1499
01:05:49,710 --> 01:05:50,920
麦克 上!
Mac attack!

1500
01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:53,840
麦克 上!
Mac attack!

1501
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:07,680
哦 天啊!
Oh, God!

1502
01:06:07,850 --> 01:06:09,060
哦 泰迪!
Oh, Teddy!

1503
01:06:09,230 --> 01:06:11,020
哦 我为什么要听你的? 该死!
Oh, why'd I listen to you? Shit!

1504
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:12,690
你太能说了!
You were so convincing!

1505
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:14,110
对不起 伙计
I'm sorry, buddy.

1506
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:16,570
嘿! 我的手臂没知觉了
Hey! My arm's kind of tingly.

1507
01:06:16,730 --> 01:06:18,400
我想我可能受伤了
I think I might have hurt it.

1508
01:06:18,570 --> 01:06:19,950
感觉很奇怪 伙计!
Feels weird, man!

1509
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:21,950
他该死的肩膀在他的嘴里
His damn shoulder is in his mouth.

1510
01:06:28,370 --> 01:06:29,370
哦!
Oh!

1511
01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:30,750
嘿!
Hey!

1512
01:06:30,830 --> 01:06:33,170
大麦克 伙计 我很抱歉 那个辣鸡
Big Mac, man, I'm sorry about that. That hot chicken,

1513
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:35,630
它让我反胃 伙计!
it just kind of got on rewind, man!

1514
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,340
要么上面 要么下面
It was either the back or the front,

1515
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:39,050
我新买的裤子 老铁
and I just got these pants, fam.

1516
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:42,380
天啊 我度过了最糟糕的一夜!
God, I'm having the worst night!

1517
01:07:00,530 --> 01:07:02,200
你好啊 泰迪
Hello, Teddy.

1518
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:08,660
嘿 宝贝
Hey, babe.

1519
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:11,000
别跟我说“嘿 宝贝”
You don't need to "Hey, babe" me.

1520
01:07:14,670 --> 01:07:16,170
我知道发生了什么
I know what's going on.

1521
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:21,340
怎么了?
What's going on?

1522
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:24,720
夜晚?
The late hours?

1523
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,140
秘密?
The secrecy?

1524
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:28,970
承认吧 泰迪
Just admit it, Teddy.

1525
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:30,470
承认什么?
Just admit what?

1526
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:31,810
很明显
It's so obvious.

1527
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:35,440
你害怕了
You're getting cold feet.

1528
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:43,780
是啊!
Yeah!

1529
01:07:44,990 --> 01:07:46,530
害怕?
Cold feet?

1530
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:49,240
自从你求婚 你变了
Ever since you proposed, you haven't been yourself.

1531
01:07:49,410 --> 01:07:50,910
害怕?
Cold feet?

1532
01:07:51,330 --> 01:07:55,000
丽莎 我不害怕
Lisa, I am not getting cold feet.

1533
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,290
事实上 完全相反
In fact, it's the complete opposite.

1534
01:07:58,380 --> 01:07:59,800
我干劲十足
My feet are very warm.

1535
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:01,760
我要这个
I want this.

1536
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:02,920
我道歉
And I apologize.

1537
01:08:03,090 --> 01:08:05,590
如果事情最近有点疯狂 我道歉
I apologize if things have been a little crazy as of late.

1538
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:06,930
但是 宝贝
But, babe,

1539
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:08,970
你必须知道我在这里
you gotta know that I am out here.

1540
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:10,890
我在努力
I'm trying.

1541
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:13,480
好吗? 我在历练自己
Okay? I am busting my ass

1542
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:15,520
日日夜夜
every day, every night,

1543
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:16,850
为了我们
for us.

1544
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:18,770
为了我和你
For me and you.

1545
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:20,730
我在一个不同的世界 宝贝
I'm in a different world out there, babe,

1546
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:23,400
而这个世界压得我喘不过气
and this world is stressing me out.

1547
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:27,280
它压得我喘不过气
It is stressing me out.

1548
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:30,580
对不起 我怀疑你
I'm sorry I doubted you.

1549
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:32,740
我知道这种职业变化会经历很多
I know this career change has been a lot.

1550
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:34,580
是很多
It's a lot.

1551
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,000
太多了
It's so much.

1552
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:39,750
它是如此 如此之多
It's so, so much.

1553
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:41,750
可怜的宝贝
Poor baby.

1554
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:47,130
我爱你
I love you.

1555
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:53,560
我也爱你
I love you, too.

1556
01:08:57,310 --> 01:08:58,980
您还要点别的吗?
Does that complete your order?

1557
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:00,610
等等 稍等 我不要那个苹果派了
Wait. Hold up. I don't want that apple pie.

1558
01:09:00,690 --> 01:09:03,530
抱歉 我听不清 电话里有小孩
I'm sorry, it's kind of hard to hear you. There's a baby in the background.

1559
01:09:03,730 --> 01:09:04,820
嘘 宝贝 我说安静
Hush. Baby, I said be quiet.

1560
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:06,030
- 坐下  - 是的 请再说一遍
- Sit down. - Yeah, say it one more time for me.

1561
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:07,820
再说一遍? 这个汉堡怎么样?
Say it again? Is that burger good or what?

1562
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:10,240
我能不能请求孩子不要说话?
Any way I can get you to respectfully shut that baby up?

1563
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:11,620
你说什么?
What'd you say?

1564
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:13,410
只需把窗户打开 为了爱...
Just pull up to the window, for the love...

1565
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:15,700
哦 该死! 哦 该死!
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1566
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:17,870
没用 我看见你了 泰迪
It won't work. I see you, Teddy.

1567
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,120
没用的
It's not working.

1568
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:22,340
泰迪·沃克 藏在饮料机后面
Teddy Walker, behind the soda machine.

1569
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:23,590
- 你好?  - 该死!
- Hello? - Shit!

1570
01:09:23,670 --> 01:09:24,670
泰迪·沃克!
Teddy Walker!

1571
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:25,920
我看到你在看...
I see you looking at...

1572
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:27,630
我们现在在对视
We're making eye contact right now.

1573
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:28,840
睁开眼 泰迪
Open your eyes, Teddy.

1574
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:30,180
泰迪 过来!
Teddy, come here!

1575
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:31,260
斯图尔特!
Stewart!

1576
01:09:31,350 --> 01:09:32,470
嘿
Hey.

1577
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:33,640
斯图尔特 你在叫“泰迪”?
Stewart, you were sayin' "Teddy"?

1578
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:34,850
大约10次
About 10 times.

1579
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:36,140
嘿! 嘿
Hey! Hey.

1580
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:37,770
- 请帮我个忙  - 是吗?
- Do me a favor. - Yeah?

1581
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:40,350
去那边 处理下汽车点餐
Go over there and handle that situation at the drive-through.

1582
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:42,560
然后我告诉你做什么 因为我当班
And I'll tell you what to do after that because I'm in charge.

1583
01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:44,900
- 嘿 那么 请稍等  - 你好?
- Hey, so, give me a second. - Hello?

1584
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:45,980
女士
Ma'am.

1585
01:09:46,070 --> 01:09:47,530
- 我说我不想吃派  - 好的 女士
- I said I don't want the pie. - Okay. Ma'am.

1586
01:09:47,610 --> 01:09:48,610
她不想要派
She don't want the pie.

1587
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:49,820
去掉派
Take the pie off.

1588
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:52,280
- 我说我不想要派  - 拉起来!
- I said I ain't gettin' the pie. - Pull up!

1589
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:53,740
你听到了吗? 拉起窗户!
You heard me? Pull up to the window!

1590
01:09:53,870 --> 01:09:55,490
好了 等她拉起窗户
All right. When she pull up,

1591
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:57,500
告诉我 因为我想给那孩子两拳
tell me, 'cause I'mma come punch the baby in the face.

1592
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,080
上帝不知道 只告诉我
God don't see everything. Just let me know.

1593
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:02,670
嘿 跟我说说 伙计 你好吗?
Hey, talk to me, man. How you doing?

1594
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:05,630
你知道 我以为是伍德布里奇的朋克
You know, I thought it was the Woodbridge punks

1595
01:10:05,710 --> 01:10:07,050
闯入了学校 但是现在
that broke into the school, but now,

1596
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:08,340
一切明了了
it all makes sense.

1597
01:10:09,090 --> 01:10:12,970
我在犯罪现场找到了这个
I found this at the scene of the crime.

1598
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:17,220
所以你们做了什么? 入侵我的电脑?
So what'd you do? Break into my computer?

1599
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:18,810
盗取期中测验?
Steal the midterm?

1600
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:21,140
- 有点偏执 不是吗 斯图?  - 我有吗?
- Being a little paranoid, aren't we, Stew? - Am I?

1601
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:23,360
斯图尔特 这只是一个装有鸡肉包装的塑料袋
Stewart, that's a plastic bag with a chicken wrapper in it

1602
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:24,860
写上“证据”一词
with the word "evidence" written on it,

1603
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:26,570
这可能是你的笔迹
which is probably in your handwriting.

1604
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:29,780
这不算铁板钉钉 斯图
It's not exactly a smoking gun, Stew.

1605
01:10:30,150 --> 01:10:31,610
这只是一个巧合 对吗?
It's just a coincidence, right?

1606
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:32,780
大概
Probably.

1607
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:35,030
如果你偷了试题
If you stole that test,

1608
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:36,620
我会发现的 泰迪
I will find out, Teddy.

1609
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:39,580
我是一个诚实的人 努力过着诚实的生活
I'm an honest man trying to make an honest living.

1610
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:42,120
泰迪·沃克不作弊
Teddy Walker does not cheat.

1611
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:43,880
你们作弊了
You cheated.

1612
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:48,420
你们每个人都作弊了
Every last one of you cheated.

1613
01:10:51,630 --> 01:10:53,930
凯瑞 这些都是非常严厉的指责
Carrie, those are very strong accusations.

1614
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:56,140
没错 怎么了?
For real. Like, what?

1615
01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:57,390
我受到冒犯
I'm offended.

1616
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,680
好吧 我会注意的 泰迪
Well, I'll take note of that, Teddy.

1617
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:01,600
你们哪一个承认错误?
Which one of you wanna own up to it?

1618
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:03,350
我也感到被冒犯
I'm offended, too.

1619
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:06,150
鲍比 你是一个罪犯
Bobby. You a criminal.

1620
01:11:06,230 --> 01:11:08,270
你显然不擅长犯罪 这就是你入狱的原因
You obviously not good at it. That's why you in jail.

1621
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:10,190
但是你策划了整件事吗?
Did you orchestrate this whole thing?

1622
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:13,240
我说 你为什么要找我 让我说?
I mean, why you gonna pick on me and profile me?

1623
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:15,280
我是唯一被关在这里的人
I'm the only one locked up here.

1624
01:11:15,450 --> 01:11:17,370
所以 如果我被关在这里
So if I'm locked up in here,

1625
01:11:17,450 --> 01:11:20,200
我怎么能在那偷试题呢 凯瑞女士?
how can I be out there stealing the test, Miss Carrie?

1626
01:11:20,290 --> 01:11:21,540
等一下!
Wait a minute!

1627
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:22,790
你们都偷了试题?
Y'all stole the test?

1628
01:11:22,870 --> 01:11:24,710
我什么也没说 什么也不知道
I'm not sayin' nothin'. I don't know nothin'.

1629
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,250
我屁也不知道
I don't know shit.

1630
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:29,090
因为我从来没说过有人偷了试题
'Cause I never said nothin' about anybody stealing the test.

1631
01:11:29,550 --> 01:11:31,420
我很快查清真相
I'm about to get to the truth.

1632
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:33,380
谁偷了试题?
Who stole the test?

1633
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:35,260
麦克
Mac,

1634
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:38,640
你想向我解释下你怎么取得满分的吗?
you wanna explain to me how you got a perfect score?

1635
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:39,970
就是这样 好吗?
Here's the thing. All right?

1636
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:42,890
我知道我没有得到满分
I know I didn't get a perfect score.

1637
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:44,310
因为我故意空了一些
Because I missed a few on purpose.

1638
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,480
蠢货!
Fudge!

1639
01:11:47,690 --> 01:11:49,020
谢谢你!
Thank you!

1640
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:50,440
你说漏了 麦克!
You's a snitch, Mac!

1641
01:11:50,530 --> 01:11:52,070
告密的婊子们
Snitches are bitches.

1642
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,280
我不喜欢欺骗的人
I don't like cheaters.

1643
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:58,450
而且我讨厌我正在教一个全是作弊者的班级!
And I hate that I am teaching a room full of cheaters!

1644
01:11:58,990 --> 01:12:00,790
我不喜欢骗人的男人
I don't like men that cheat.

1645
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:02,450
我不喜欢骗人的女人
I don't like women that cheat.

1646
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:03,750
我甚至不和政治家打交道
I don't even deal with politicians.

1647
01:12:03,830 --> 01:12:05,710
你知道为什么? 因为他们都是骗子
You know why? 'Cause they all cheaters.

1648
01:12:05,790 --> 01:12:07,210
我甚至不吃奇多
I don't even eat Cheetos.

1649
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:09,210
你们知道为什么? 因为它听起来像“骗子”
You know why? 'Cause it sound like "cheaters."

1650
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:11,760
而且奇多掉的渣的颜色让你想到川普
Plus that Cheeto dust'll give you that Trump color.

1651
01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:13,010
是啊
Yeah.

1652
01:12:13,090 --> 01:12:15,680
很难甩掉手上的渣
It's hard to get that Cheeto dust off your hands.

1653
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,390
会弄脏裤子
It'll mess up your jabos.

1654
01:12:17,890 --> 01:12:19,260
你知道吗 开始我挺喜欢你
You know, I liked you at first.

1655
01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:22,470
我和你们结束了 你们都可以离开我的课堂了
I'm done with all of y'all. All of y'all can get up out my class.

1656
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:23,890
- 我受够了  - 什么?
- I'm done with y'all. - What?

1657
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:25,560
好吧 凯瑞 让我... 我想说点什么
Okay, Carrie, let me... I wanna say something.

1658
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,810
如果我拿不到高中毕业证 他就要辍学了
If I don't get my GED, he's gonna drop out of high school.

1659
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:30,110
如果我没拿到毕业证 我就要进监狱了
If I don't get my GED, I'm going to prison.

1660
01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:31,440
我需要这个毕业证!
I need this GED!

1661
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:34,150
好好改造 这才是你要做的 你在监狱里
You need to keep your booty closed. That's what you need to do. You in jail.

1662
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:35,650
不 我需要毕业证
No, I need this GED.

1663
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:37,240
我们不能靠兰迪的薪水生活
We can't live on Randy's salary.

1664
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:39,450
请不要让我回家 我讨厌我的孩子们
Please don't make me go home. I hate my kids.

1665
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,490
但我喜欢做妈妈
But I love being a mom.

1666
01:12:42,830 --> 01:12:45,160
我很幸运 太有福了
I'm blessed. So blessed.

1667
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:46,870
凯瑞 拜托
Carrie, please.

1668
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:50,420
我不能这一辈子都在卡罗拉给醉汉开车
I cannot live a lifetime of driving around drunks in a Corolla.

1669
01:12:50,590 --> 01:12:52,050
看 我最不想做的
Look, the last thing I wanna do

1670
01:12:52,130 --> 01:12:53,920
是去万达打扫客房
is be cleaning the rooms at the Best Western.

1671
01:12:54,010 --> 01:12:55,050
好吗? 因为这一切...
Okay? 'Cause all that...

1672
01:12:55,130 --> 01:12:56,380
特别是那些钟点房
Especially them short stay rooms.

1673
01:12:56,470 --> 01:12:57,840
因为你懂的 对吗?
'Cause you know what that is, right?

1674
01:12:57,930 --> 01:12:59,300
都是用过的安全套
That's just gonna be used condoms.

1675
01:12:59,390 --> 01:13:00,390
弄脏的床单
Soiled sheets.

1676
01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:02,260
那不就是你遇见你胯下婊子的地方吗?
Ain't that where you met your bottom bitch at?

1677
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:06,140
你知道特丽娜?
You know Trina?

1678
01:13:07,730 --> 01:13:09,230
她也有大屁股
She got a fat ass, too.

1679
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:12,360
你们知道吗? 你们都有令人动容的故事
You know what? All of you got little sob stories

1680
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:14,030
但你们都应该想到结果
but y'all should've thought about that

1681
01:13:14,110 --> 01:13:15,690
在你们偷试题之前
before you went and stole the test.

1682
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:19,780
滚出我的课堂吧
Just get the hell up out my class.

1683
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:25,370
那不是可怜的故事
It's not a sob story.

1684
01:13:25,450 --> 01:13:27,250
不! 我想要属于我的生活
No! I'm the one who wants to get my life together.

1685
01:13:27,330 --> 01:13:29,040
我给你说说杰伦的事
Let me tell you something about Jay.

1686
01:13:29,130 --> 01:13:30,420

是我
It was me.

1691
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:42,850
你不要对他们发火
You shouldn't be mad at none of them.

1692
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:44,680
我是说 没错 他们看了答案
I mean, yeah, they looked at the answers,

1693
01:13:44,770 --> 01:13:46,680
但如果不是我把答案放在他们腿上 他们就不会看到
but they wouldn't have if I hadn't had put it on their lap.

1694
01:13:48,350 --> 01:13:50,980
我对此负责 我是策划者
I take responsibility for it all. I was the mastermind.

1695
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:53,150
我精心策划了整个事情 就是我
I orchestrated the whole thing. It was all me.

1696

I'm just trying to do what's right, Carrie.

1700
01:14:01,910 --> 01:14:03,700
现在你可以滚出我的课堂了
Now you can get the hell out my class.

1701
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:07,160
上路吧 混蛋
Hit the road, Jack.

1702
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:10,620
上帝会惩罚你的 出门小心撞门
Don't let the doorknob hit you where the good Lord split you.

1703
01:14:11,290 --> 01:14:13,380
我以为我说了以后你会谅解我
I thought that when I said all that stuff that you would listen to it.

1704
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:16,340
不 不 不 你在这里没有第二次机会
No, no, no. You gets no second chances up in here.

1705
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:17,510
起码我这里没有
Not with me no more.

1706
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:19,050
我不会再让你回来了
I ain't got your back no more.

1707
01:14:19,130 --> 01:14:20,930
- 你根本不想在这里!  - 我想要在这里
- You don't even wanna be here! - I do wanna be here.

1708
01:14:21,010 --> 01:14:22,840
你根本不想在这里 泰迪!
You don't even wanna be here, Teddy!

1709
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:23,930
不
No.

1710
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:25,140
至于其他人呢?
And as for the rest of you?

1711
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:29,020
我希望你们反思反思 你们是否真的需要
I want you to think long and hard about if you really want this.

1712
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:32,850
下课
Class dismissed.

1713
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:37,400
“求解…”
"Find a solution for the..."

1714
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:39,740
我不懂这玩意 我需要你
I don't know none of this shit. I need you.

- I need your help. - Put your damn hand down!

1716
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:44,870
我要去大润发 赶在他们关门之前
I'm going to Rainbows before they close.

1717
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:47,080
那是情绪购物 凯瑞
That's emotional shopping, Carrie.

1718
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:48,790
是大润发 你这幸运的小母牛
It's Rainbows, you blessed heifer.

1719
01:14:48,870 --> 01:14:50,290
超他妈便宜
Shit is cheap.

1720
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,840
泰迪 泰迪 泰迪
Teddy, Teddy, Teddy.

1721
01:14:57,550 --> 01:14:59,460
你好傻
You are stupid.

1722
01:15:00,670 --> 01:15:02,590
在你承认之前 她不知道发生了什么事
She didn't know what was going on until you admitted it.

1723
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:04,470
我们一直在瞒着她
We had her right up till the end,

1724
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:05,890
但是泰迪
and then Teddy,

1725
01:15:05,970 --> 01:15:07,100
脑子缺筋...
old brick head...

1726
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:09,850
喔 泰迪!
Ow, Teddy!

1727
01:15:09,930 --> 01:15:10,980
你活该
You deserved that.

1728
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:13,390
学校
A school.

1729
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:16,480
我们从未接受过这样的项目
We've never taken on a project like that.

1730
01:15:16,570 --> 01:15:19,530
好吧 我是一个不拘一格的思考者
Well, I am an outside-of-the-box thinker.

1731
01:15:19,610 --> 01:15:21,030
那就是我
That's just who I am.

1732
01:15:21,110 --> 01:15:23,950
我想如果学生对他们的环境感到兴奋
I think that if students are excited about their environment,

1733
01:15:24,030 --> 01:15:25,660
他们会对学习感到兴奋
they'll be excited about learning.

1734
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:28,370
这完全有道理 我知道我会
That makes total sense. I know I would.

1735
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:29,870
嗯 我很高兴听你说
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

1736
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:32,500
如果你有兴趣 我很乐意带你参观学校
If you're interested, I'd love to give you a tour of the school.

1737
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:33,790
你可以在任何一天来
You could come by any day,

1738
01:15:33,870 --> 01:15:35,880
或者 你知道 你甚至可以放学后来
or, you know, you could even come after school.

1739
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:38,380
我们也有几个夜校课程
We have several night programs as well.

1740
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:41,800
- 嘿  - 嘿
- Hey. - Hey.

1741
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:46,930
好的 给我看看你得到什么 给我看看你得到什么
Okay, show me what you got. Show me what you got.

1742
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:48,930
你得到什么? 来吧
What you got for me? Come on.

1743
01:15:49,930 --> 01:15:50,930
你有什么?
What you got?

1744
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:53,430
你杀了我! 你赢了!
You killin' me! You won!

1745
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:54,690
恭喜
Congratulations.

1746
01:15:54,770 --> 01:15:56,270
我为你感到骄傲 哈
I'm proud of you, boo.

1747
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:59,440
现在 你在德州扑克中击败你的老师并不酷
Now, it's not cool that you beat your teacher at Texas hold 'em

1748
01:15:59,530 --> 01:16:02,740
但是我喜欢你在底池赔率上计算的方式
but I like the way you nailed down the calculations on the pot odds.

1749
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:05,070
所以我不介意
So I'mma let this slide.

1750
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,740
现在 记住我说的话
Now, remember what I said.

1751
01:16:06,990 --> 01:16:08,160
没有捷径
There are no shortcuts.

1752
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:09,830
你必须靠自己
You gotta work your butt off.

1753
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:11,870
好吗? 给我一些爱
Okay? Give me some love.

1754
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:14,460
我很为你感到骄傲
I'm so proud of you.

1755
01:16:14,540 --> 01:16:15,920
继续 去过美好的一天
Go on and have a good day now.

1756
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,130
也许有一天我会带你去拉斯维加斯
Maybe one day I'll take you to Vegas.

1757
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:26,470
那很酷
That was cool.

1758
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:29,760
你知道...
You know...

1759
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:32,020
这里曾经是特别教室
This used to be the Special Ed classroom when I went here.

1760
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:33,560
它仍然是
It still is.

1761
01:16:34,230 --> 01:16:35,440
你做特殊教育?
You teach Special Ed?

1762
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:38,690
特殊教育是我的工作之一
Special Ed is one of my sections.

1763
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:41,440
实际上 这是我的最爱之一
It's one of my favorites, actually.

1764
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:47,400
你知道 那个孩子让我想起了自己
You know, that kid reminds me a lot of myself.

1765
01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:50,110
我上学的时候 我不会做数学
I couldn't do math for shit when I was in school.

1766
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,780
不同的是我没有像你这样的老师
Difference is I didn't have a teacher like you

1767
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:54,410
愿意留下来帮助我
that was willing to stay behind to help me.

1768
01:16:54,490 --> 01:16:56,290
我知道你在做什么 泰迪
I know what you're doin', Teddy.

1769
01:16:56,370 --> 01:16:57,450
我承认
And I admit,

1770
01:16:57,540 --> 01:17:00,870
为你的同学们担责是非常酷的
it was very cool of you to take the fall for your classmates.

1771
01:17:02,170 --> 01:17:03,420
但你是一个骗子
But you're a hustler.

1772
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:06,170
想着不劳而获
Tryin' to skate by without doing the work.

1773
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:07,840
你应该知道你不能骗我
You should know you can't hustle me.

1774
01:17:08,130 --> 01:17:09,220
我知道
I do.

1775
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:11,590
好吗? 我知道
Okay? I do know that.

1776
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:13,510
我向你保证 我不会了
And I promise you, I'm done.

1777
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:15,260
我不再欺骗了
I'm not hustling no more.

1778
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:18,230
夜校就是我的第二次机会
Night school is about second chances.

1779
01:17:18,690 --> 01:17:21,350
如果你不给我机会 我就完了
And if I don't get this second chance, then it's over for me.

1780
01:17:21,730 --> 01:17:23,900
夜校就是我的全部
Night school is all that I have.

1781
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:27,820
拜托
Please.

1782
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:30,400
我有一个条件
I'll consider it on one condition.

1783
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:32,070
尽管说
Whatever it is.

1784
01:17:32,570 --> 01:17:33,910
我们要给你测试
We get you tested.

1785
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:36,450
性病的? 这不是问题
For STDs? That's not an issue.

1786
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:39,040
我不介意 我的意思是...
I don't mind that. I mean...

1787
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,410
他妈的
God damn it.

1788
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:44,040
有一次安全套破了 因为我把蛋蛋塞进去了...
There was one time where the condom popped 'cause I put my balls inside the...

1789
01:17:44,130 --> 01:17:46,250
不 你这个白痴
No, you idiot.

1790
01:17:46,630 --> 01:17:48,300
关于学习障碍
For learning disabilities.

1791
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:52,970
没人在乎你和你的贱人们的轶事
Nobody cares about your escapades with your bitches.

1792
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:56,430
那么测试结果是什么 凯瑞?
So what are the test results, Carrie?

1793
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,850
泰迪 问题是...
Teddy, the issue is...

1794
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:02,270
你是临床性的愚钝
You're clinically dumb.

1795
01:18:05,650 --> 01:18:06,850
我就知道
I knew it.

1796
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:10,360
我知道有问题 我就知道有问题
I knew it was a mistake. I knew it was a mistake.

1797
01:18:10,730 --> 01:18:12,690
伙计 抱歉 我在逗你
Boy, I'm sorry. I'm just messin' with you.

1798
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:14,530
- 拜托 凯瑞  - 听着 听着
- Come on, Carrie. - Look, look.

1799
01:18:14,610 --> 01:18:18,030
我的怀疑是对的 而你 我的朋友 有阅读困难
My suspicions were right, and you, my friend, are dyslexic.

1800
01:18:18,910 --> 01:18:19,950
好吧
Okay.

1801
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:22,410
好吧 这就意味着我有问题
Okay, so that just means I'm having problems

1802
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:23,700
对于我的阅读和写作 对吗?
with my reading and my writing, right?

1803
01:18:23,790 --> 01:18:26,500
是的 但你也患有计算障碍
Yep. But you also have dyscalculia.

1804
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:28,460
计算障碍? 我甚至不知道如何念它
Dyscalculia? I don't even know how to pronounce that.

1805
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,750
基本上 它就像阅读障碍 但是关于数学
Basically, it's like dyslexia, but with math.

1806
01:18:34,130 --> 01:18:35,300
没错啊
That's what I got.

1807
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:38,390
我就知道! 现在你告诉我 一切清楚了
I knew it! Now that you say it, it makes sense.

1808
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,680
如果你带我去一家餐馆然后说 “泰迪 留下小费”
If you take me to a restaurant and you say, "Teddy, leave the tip,"

1809
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:42,260
我放的到处都是
I'm all over the place.

1810
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:43,970
这就是原因 我们找到了!
That's exactly what it is. We did it!

1811
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:45,180
我还没说完
We're not done.

1812
01:18:45,270 --> 01:18:47,640
你也有处理障碍
You also have a processing disorder.

1813
01:18:47,730 --> 01:18:49,980
我得了前列腺癌?
I got a touch of prostate cancer?

1814
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:51,440
她一次也没碰过我的屁股
She didn't touch my ass one time.

1815
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:54,150
我说“处理障碍”
I said "processing disorder."

1816
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,400
凯瑞 如果你不帮我
Carrie, if you're not gonna help me,

1817
01:18:56,490 --> 01:18:57,780
那我们是在浪费时间
then we're wasting our time.

1818
01:18:57,860 --> 01:18:59,870
给我解释这是什么东西
Explain to me what this stuff is.

1819
01:18:59,950 --> 01:19:02,530
如果我有处理... 哦 我的天
If I got a processing... Oh, my God.

1820
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:05,910
我处理不了它
I'm not processing it.

1821
01:19:07,870 --> 01:19:09,710
我不能处理这该死的东西
I didn't process none of that shit.

1822
01:19:09,790 --> 01:19:14,550
你只是一个多种学习障碍的又大又美的混合体
You are just one big, beautiful mixed drink of learning disabilities.

1823
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:15,960
所以我不傻?
So I'm not dumb?

1824
01:19:16,050 --> 01:19:18,090
孩子 一开始只是在开玩笑
Boy, I was just playin' when I said that earlier.

1825
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:20,930
好老师不会说他们的学生愚蠢
No good teacher would ever call their students dumb.

1826
01:19:21,010 --> 01:19:22,430
好吧
Okay.

1827
01:19:22,850 --> 01:19:24,560
那么我们该如何解决? 谈谈解决办法
So how do we fix it? Let's talk solution.

1828
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,310
好吧 你的问题无法治愈
Well, there's no cure for what you have.

1829
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:27,980
哦 我的天!
Oh, my God!

1830
01:19:29,190 --> 01:19:30,730
我得了学习疱疹?
I got learning herpes?

1831
01:19:30,810 --> 01:19:31,860
孩子!
Boy!

1832
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:33,270
哦 该死!
Oh, shit!

1833
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:35,860
没有学习疱疹这样的东西
There is no such thing as learning herpes.

1834
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:37,240
我起水泡了
I'm blistering up.

1835
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:39,320
因为我正在努力思考
It's 'cause I'm tryin' to think.

1836
01:19:39,410 --> 01:19:41,110
嘿 泰迪!
Hey, Teddy!

1837
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,370
大麦克
Big Mac.

1838
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:44,450
- 主犯  - 哦 天啊!
- Ringleader. - Oh, my gosh!

1839
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:45,620
泰迪 你在这里!
Teddy, you're here!

1840
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:47,500
嘿 泰迪! 怎么样了 伙计?
Hey, Teddy! What's up, man?

1841
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:49,290
传统的教学方法
Teaching the conventional way

1842
01:19:49,370 --> 01:19:51,370
对泰迪没有作用
just isn't gonna get it done for Teddy.

1843
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:53,130
所以我们要混合多种途径
So we're gonna mix it up.

1844
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,130
他们在外面
They out here getting it in.

1845
01:19:56,050 --> 01:19:57,380
怎么了 凯瑞? 你为什么来这里?
What's going on, Carrie? Why you in here?

1846
01:19:57,470 --> 01:19:59,300
为什么你在圈里? 怎么回事?
Why you in the ring? What's going on?

1847
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:02,510
泰迪 你的那些困难与注意力有关
Teddy, your difficulties are focus-related.

1848
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:04,970
我要帮你消除扰乱注意力的东西
My goal is to remove that mind chatter

1849
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:08,180
然后你的注意力就畅通无阻了
so you can achieve properly unencumbered neural pathways.

1850
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:09,770
这不是一个圈
And this isn't a ring.

1851
01:20:09,850 --> 01:20:11,100
这是六边形

小短裙 穿过广场

1939
01:23:20,630 --> 01:23:22,670
抱着你的哲学论文
You're clutching onto your philosophy thesis,

1940
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:23,750
等你上课的时候

1941
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:25,300
教授对它的光彩感到震惊

不是以性方式 而是以性感的方式 你知道吗?
Not in a sexual way, but not not in a sexual way, you know?

1945
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:35,270
他看起来像布鲁诺·马尔斯一样怪

即便他是大学者 他有时会穿粉红色的外套
Even though he's super academic, he wears pink blazers sometimes.

1947
01:23:38,270 --> 01:23:39,940
好吧 你也可以上大学
Well, you can still go to college

你不了解兰迪

1954
01:23:50,450 --> 01:23:53,030
为什么你不能说 “嘿 兰迪 我想这样做

也不是你家的清洁工
and I'm not your house cleaner.

1991
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:23,620
当我拿到高中毕业证 我会追求自己的梦想
And when I get my GED, I'm gonna pursue my dreams

1992
01:25:23,710 --> 01:25:25,080
我需要你的支持
and I'm gonna need your support.

1993
01:25:25,170 --> 01:25:27,920
而且我也要定期做爱
And also I wanna have sex on a regular basis.

1994
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:30,630
我是说 很刺激的做爱
I mean, like, really weird sex.

1995
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:33,630
不是“生个孩子”那样的做爱 而是“45分钟”的做爱
Like, not "make a baby" sex, but "45 minutes" sex.

1996
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:35,760
就像 “五十度灰”里面的
Like, Fifty Shades of Grey sex.

1997
01:25:35,850 --> 01:25:38,100
我希望你像开核桃一样弄我
I want you to crack this up like a walnut.

1998
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:39,640
我说清楚了吗?
Do I make myself clear?

1999
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:41,140
好的! 好的!
Okay! Okay!

2000
01:25:41,230 --> 01:25:42,810
我很抱歉 宝贝
I'm so sorry, baby.

2001
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:44,850
我觉得你是一个疯狂的摇滚明星
I think you're a freakin' rock star.

2002
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,400
就你刚才对我说的话
And judging by what you just said to me,

2003
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,070
我迫不及待想成为你的色情明星
I can't wait to be your porn star.

2004
01:25:52,570 --> 01:25:55,360

It's a clean batch. I want this punch to stay that way.

抱歉 这次舞会只允许学生
Excuse me. This dance is for students only.

Well, this is my night school class, and they are students here.

铭记于心

没有人 能阻止梦想放飞

没有沙漠 也没有蛇能阻挠我
No desert, no snake gonna take me down

2042
01:28:30,810 --> 01:28:33,310
等等 亲爱的 谁在照看孩子们?

2044
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:38,150
她说 “我想成为一名空乘”
She said, "I wanna be a flight attendant."

2045
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:39,360
你们看?

2046
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:44,530
“我想要从一个地方到另一个地方 就像去...”
"I wanna go from place to place. It'd be like going..."

我是认真的

2050
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:56,620
从来没有一位老师像你这样相信我
There's never been a teacher that believed in me the way that you do.

2051
01:28:56,790 --> 01:28:58,540
泰迪 我能说什么?
Teddy, what can I say?

2052
01:28:58,710 --> 01:29:01,880
你在如此短的时间内成长了很多
You've grown so much in such a short period of time.

2053
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,840
如果你能跟上我们在做的
And if you keep up with all the stuff that we've been doing,

2054
01:29:05,010 --> 01:29:06,720
你前途一片光明
you are well on your way.

2055
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:09,090
我只是...
I'm just...

01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:11,300
我真的 真的为你感到骄傲
I'm really, really proud of you.

2057
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:19,440
你知道 凯瑞
You know, Carrie,

2058
01:29:20,810 --> 01:29:22,940
过去这几周令人惊叹
these past few weeks have been amazing.

2059
01:29:24,020 --> 01:29:27,360
我是说 我们的感觉 不言而喻 很强烈
I mean, our chemistry, it goes without saying, it's strong.

2060
01:29:27,530 --> 01:29:29,450
我感觉到了 我知道你也是
I sense it. I know you do, too.

2061
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:32,490
但是这种神奇的时候我们也许...
But as magical as these moments that we've been having may be...

2062
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:33,910
傻瓜 我是同性恋
Fool, I'm gay.

2063
01:29:33,990 --> 01:29:35,450
我没开玩笑
I'm not tryin' to play.

2064
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:36,950
现在 我不否认我变态
Now, I'm not sayin' I ain't no freak.

2065
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,200
因为我觉得你也是
'Cause I'd drop it off on you.

2066
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:39,500
我是女同性恋
I'm a lesbian.

2067
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:42,380
如果你伪装 你可以
If you wanna pursue acting, you can.

2068
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:43,710
不 我是同性恋
No, I'm gay.

2069
01:29:43,790 --> 01:29:45,340
再说一遍 听起来你说你是同性恋
Say that again. It sound like you said you're gay.

2070
01:29:45,420 --> 01:29:46,670
我是同性恋
I'm gay.

2071
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:48,380
我喜欢女人
I like women.

2072
01:29:49,430 --> 01:29:50,510
你确定吗?
Are you sure?

2073
01:29:50,590 --> 01:29:51,760
因为我完全感觉不到
Because I'm getting a whole different vibe.

2074
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,140
- 哦 该死的!  - 我很确定
- Oh, hell no! - I'm pretty sure.

2075
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:54,510
哦 天啊
Oh, God.

2076
01:29:56,930 --> 01:29:58,020
泰迪?
Teddy?

2077
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:01,190
左边那个是你喜欢的类型吗?
Is the one on the left your type?

2078
01:30:01,270 --> 01:30:03,730
- 紧身连衣裙的那个是  - 该死 那是我的
- The one in the tight dress is. - Shit, that's mine.

你们来了
There they go.

2081
01:30:08,650 --> 01:30:10,200
你在这做什么?
What are you doin' here?

2082
01:30:12,070 --> 01:30:13,950
你在高中舞会上做什么?
What are you doing at a high school prom?

2083
01:30:15,370 --> 01:30:16,870
你在这做什么 宝贝?
What are you doin' here, babe?

2084
01:30:16,950 --> 01:30:18,040
你为什么来这里?
Why you here?

2085
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:22,120
帕托斯基校长有意让我们重新设计学校
Principal Patowsky is interested in us redesigning the school

2086
01:30:22,290 --> 01:30:23,920
- 所以他让我们来看看...  - 哦 是吗?
- so he asked us to stop by... - Oh, he did?

2087
01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:25,250

Yeah.

2088
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,090
玩儿得好啊 斯图尔特
Well played, Stewart.

2089
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:29,260
你们俩彼此认识?
You two know each other?

2090
01:30:29,970 --> 01:30:31,170
问斯图尔特
Ask Stewart.

2091
01:30:31,630 --> 01:30:33,260
是的 我们一起上高中
Yes, we went to high school together.

2092
01:30:33,430 --> 01:30:35,430
我想在第一次会议上我提到了
I think I mentioned that at our first meeting.

2093
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:36,600
没有
No.

2094
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:38,680
不 你没有
No, you didn't.

2095
01:30:40,230 --> 01:30:42,020
泰迪 我很困惑
Teddy, I am so confused.

2096
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:43,480
你为什么在这?
Why are you here?

2097
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:44,730
她是谁?
And who is she?

2098
01:30:44,810 --> 01:30:46,560
我可以解释 不是你想的样子
I can explain. It ain't what it look like.

2099
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:48,480
我和一群孩子在这里
I'm in here with a bunch of kids,

2100
01:30:48,570 --> 01:30:50,030
穿着休闲服
dressed in street clothes,

2101
01:30:50,190 --> 01:30:51,400
然后想起我烧掉了烧烤小屋
then remember I blew out the barbecue shack.

2102
01:30:53,150 --> 01:30:54,820
火把我冲了出来
Fire took me out of that thing.

2103
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,490
然后我的挡风玻璃...
And now my windshield was...

2104
01:30:57,660 --> 01:30:59,280
我的车怎么一团糟...
What's got me messed up about the car...

2105
01:30:59,370 --> 01:31:00,910
我的刹车不起作用
My brakes ain't workin'

2106
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:02,700
因为我想起...
'cause I backed into this...

2107
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:03,950
她是同性恋!
She gay!

2108
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:06,670
她对我根本不感兴趣
She ain't even interested in me.

2109
01:31:07,130 --> 01:31:08,130
所以...
So...

2110
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:11,130
该死 丽莎
God damn it. Lisa.

2111
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:12,460
现在不要 现在不要 等等
Not now. Not now. Wait.

2112
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:13,630
丽莎!

2113
01:31:15,590 --> 01:31:17,720
好了 丽莎 丽莎 丽莎
Okay, Lisa. Lisa, Lisa.

2114
01:31:18,090 --> 01:31:19,760
丽莎 请听我说?
Lisa, can you listen, please?

2115
01:31:19,850 --> 01:31:21,970
- 丽莎 拜托 听着!  - 什么?
- Lisa, please, just listen! - What?

2116
01:31:22,390 --> 01:31:23,770
你要说什么 泰迪?
What are you gonna say, Teddy?

2117
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:27,770
我是高中辍学生
I'm a high school dropout.

2118
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:30,560
好吗? 那个女人 凯瑞
Okay? That woman in there, Carrie,

2119
01:31:30,650 --> 01:31:32,360
是我的夜校老师
that's my night school teacher.

2120
01:31:32,690 --> 01:31:34,110
这就是我这些夜晚所做的事情
That's what I've been doin' all these evenings.

2121
01:31:34,190 --> 01:31:35,990
我一直在学习要拿高中毕业证
I've been studying to get my GED

2122
01:31:36,150 --> 01:31:38,030
这样我才能在马文那找到工作
so that I can get a job at Marvin's.

2123
01:31:38,990 --> 01:31:40,660
所以你现在没有工作?
So you don't work there now?

2124
01:31:42,620 --> 01:31:44,160
我还没在那里工作
I don't work there yet.

2125
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:48,670
现在 我在一家叫“基督炸鸡”快餐店工作
Right now, I work at a fast food restaurant called Christian Chicken

2126
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:50,830
那里只为基督徒服务
where the chicken is Christian for some reason.

2127
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:54,630
等等 丽莎 我先说点事
Wait, Lisa, let me just say this before you judge him.

2128
01:31:54,710 --> 01:31:56,130
那不是普通的鸡肉

2129
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:57,510
不是普通的快餐
It's not the same fast food

2130
01:31:57,590 --> 01:31:59,680
不是那种看到斑点的

2131
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:02,100
很美味 我不知道他们是否用针
It's got the flavor. I don't know if they use a needle,

2132
01:32:02,180 --> 01:32:03,850
- 但他们很入味  - 杰伦 杰伦!

2133
01:32:04,850 --> 01:32:06,180
你怎么知道我的名字?
How do you know my name?

2134
01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:08,190
我的兄弟经常在课堂上谈论你
My nigga be talking about you in the class all the time.

2135
01:32:08,270 --> 01:32:10,480
他说你很糟糕 我不觉得你那么糟糕
He said you was bad. I didn't know you was that bad.

2136
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:11,770
我们是泰迪的同学

2140
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:19,950
我曾是那个餐厅的服务员
I was actually the waiter at the restaurant

2141
01:32:20,030 --> 01:32:22,030
那天泰迪把他的阴毛拔出来
when Teddy pulled all of his pubes

2142
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:24,540
然后放在芝士蛋糕里要求免单
and he put 'em in the cheesecake to get out of paying.

2143
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:26,830
现在 我们是最好的朋友

2148
01:32:39,430 --> 01:32:40,430
真的?
Really?

2149
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:42,680
- 但如果你让我解释一下...  - 不

01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:44,430
- 让我解释一下...  - 不 泰迪
- If you let me explain... - No, Teddy.

2151
01:32:44,510 --> 01:32:45,810
我受够了你的解释
I'm done with your explanations.

2152
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:49,270
一切都在骗我
You lied to me about everything.

2153
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,690
为什么?

2154
01:32:52,310 --> 01:32:53,520
让我记住你?
To impress me?

2155
01:32:53,980 --> 01:32:55,690
泰迪 我自己赚钱

2156
01:32:55,940 --> 01:32:57,780
你觉得我在乎你开什么样的车吗
You think I care about what kind of car you drive

2157
01:32:57,860 --> 01:32:59,400
或者你戴什么样的表?
or what kind of watch you have on?

2158
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:01,950
那不是我
That's not me.

2159
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:04,870
如果你这么想 那你就不了解我
If you think that, then you don't know me.

2160
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:06,200
不是的
That's not true.

2161
01:33:06,450 --> 01:33:08,500
如果你不了解我 那么你不能真的爱我
If you don't know me, then you couldn't truly love me.

2162
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:10,120
不是那样的 丽莎
That's not true, Lisa.

2163
01:33:13,330 --> 01:33:15,090
今晚不要回来了
Don't come back to the apartment tonight.

2164
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:21,220
我不知道 也许你可以跟你的夜校朋友们一起
I don't know, maybe you could stay with your night school friend.

2165
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:25,890
也许还能给她用
Maybe she has some use for this.

2166
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:29,270
这可能是假的 对吗?
It's probably fake, right?

2167
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:36,190
丽莎! 丽莎... 丽莎!
Lisa! Lisa... Lisa!

2168
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:49,910

2170
01:33:52,870 --> 01:33:56,460

You're not seriously skipping that GED test, are you?

2171
01:33:56,670 --> 01:33:57,670
是啊
Yeah.

2172
01:33:58,340 --> 01:34:00,510
我是说 我做的一切都是为了丽莎
I mean, I was doing all that stuff for Lisa.

2173
01:34:00,970 --> 01:34:02,590
如果她不在身边 那又有什么意义呢?
If she's not around, then what's the point?

2174
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:05,260
我可怜的宝贝 我为你难过
My poor baby, I feel terrible.

2175
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:08,100
哦 格蕾蒂丝 不要再溺爱这孩子了
Oh, Gladys, now stop coddling this boy.

2176
01:34:09,140 --> 01:34:11,560
你知道 西奥多 你是一个成年人
You know, Theodore, you're a grown-ass man.

2177
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:13,520
你需要自己擦屁股
You need to get your shit together.

2178
01:34:13,650 --> 01:34:14,770
我知道 爸爸

2179
01:34:14,850 --> 01:34:19,320
我是说 你说你有阅读障碍 阅读紊乱...
I mean, you say you got dyslexia, dyscoglia...

2180
01:34:19,980 --> 01:34:22,150
- 计算障碍  - 随你怎么说
- Dyscalculia. However you say it.

2181
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:24,280
问题是 你不诚实
The issue is, you're dishonest.

2182
01:34:25,070 --> 01:34:26,660
我不怪那个女孩甩了你
I don't blame that girl for dumping you.

2183
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:28,870
现在 杰拉德 够了

你知道 也许你是对的

也许我活该
Maybe I do deserve it.

2186

01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,630
我在自嘲
I was being sarcastic.

2188
01:34:39,630 --> 01:34:41,550
我给你铺床 宝贝
I'll get your bed ready, baby.

2189
01:34:41,630 --> 01:34:42,840
你想大吃一顿吧?

Oh, my gosh. Why'd he come on the bus like that?

2196
01:35:07,030 --> 01:35:08,820
我不知道 他不该没朋友
I don't know. He ain't got no friends.

2197
01:35:13,950 --> 01:35:15,200
有什么问题?
What's the problem?

2198

所以这就是下场?
So this is what it's come to?

2212

我27岁才第一次打飞机
I was 27 when I got my first hand job.

2228
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:31,820
你单身 但在我离开之前 我想告诉你那很可怜
You're at one, but before I walk away, I wanna tell you that's sad.

2229
01:36:31,990 --> 01:36:34,240
- 这是我的事实  - 我不在乎! 你为什么告诉我?
- That's my point. - I don't care! - Why you telling me?

2230
01:36:34,330 --> 01:36:36,780
我想说 我很晚才成功 我曾绝望和悲伤
My point is, I was a late bloomer, and I was desperate and sad.

我从事教育是为了改变人们的生活 而不是毁了他们
I got into education to make a difference in people's lives, not to ruin them.

2235
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:50,290

我告诉斯图尔特 如果他不来 我会打爆他的屁股
I told Stewart here I'd beat his ass if he didn't come and apologize.

2237
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:57,210
没错 是一部分原因 很小一部分
That is true. That was a part of it. A small part.

2238
01:36:57,300 --> 01:36:58,670
好吧 你们知道吗 伙计们?

I am where I'm supposed to be. All right?

2242
01:37:07,350 --> 01:37:10,140
你的命运是在脱衣舞俱乐部旁边的快餐店工作吗?
Your destiny is to work at a fast food joint next to a strip club?

2244
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:13,730
如果我站在这个停车场的正确位置
If I stand in the right spot in this parking lot,

I can smell cocoa butter and fried chicken at the same time.

2246

我不知道你们 但这对我来说很好
And I don't know about you guys, but that's a win for me.

- Teddy, listen to me. - Ain't no "Teddy, listen."

2249
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:26,700
所以不要在这里夸夸其谈了
so don't sit here and act like it was gonna be a different story.

2250
01:37:26,790 --> 01:37:29,540
而你不要表现出终于可以说我蠢的样子
And don't act like you don't wanna be able to finally say that I'm dumb.

2251
01:37:29,620 --> 01:37:30,660
不 你没有
No, you're not.

2252

Now, before we conclude, I'm sure some of you are wondering

2411
01:44:54,020 --> 01:44:57,990
为什么我们有成年学生和我们一起上台

2413

我是一位创新者

2414
01:45:02,530 --> 01:45:03,700
不拘一格
A maverick.

2415
01:45:04,490 --> 01:45:07,200
我不受...
I don't play by the...

2416
01:45:07,830 --> 01:45:11,540
所以我在皮埃蒙特历史上第一次做出决定
So I have decided for the first time in Piedmont history,

2417
01:45:11,630 --> 01:45:14,460
邀请我们的夜校毕业生加入我们的毕业典礼
to invite our night school graduates to join our seniors.

2418
01:45:14,540 --> 01:45:17,800
他们选出了一位代表发言

满怀自豪

2420
01:45:20,510 --> 01:45:22,760
有请泰迪·沃克先生

2421
01:45:24,390 --> 01:45:25,390

2424
01:45:40,030 --> 01:45:42,910
首先告诉大家一些关于我的事情
Let me just start off by telling you guys a little something about me.

2425
01:45:44,410 --> 01:45:48,700
我是泰迪·沃克 我是个骗子
I'm Teddy Walker, and I'm a liar.

2426
01:45:50,710 --> 01:45:53,870
多年来 我一直假装是另一个人
For years, I've been pretending to be somebody else.

2427
01:45:54,630 --> 01:45:56,000
有人说我不是
Somebody that I'm not.

2428
01:45:57,170 --> 01:45:59,590
我这样做的原因是因为我自卑
My reason for doing that is because I was ashamed.

2429
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:04,510
自卑于我没能像我的同学那样学习
Ashamed that I didn't learn like my classmates.

2430
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:08,350
自卑于我无法参加考试
Ashamed that I couldn't take a test.

2431
01:46:09,390 --> 01:46:12,350
自卑于我让我的家人和朋友们失望了
Ashamed that I let my family and my friends down.

2432
01:46:13,310 --> 01:46:15,520
我花费大量的时间和精力
I put so much time and energy into creating

2433
01:46:15,610 --> 01:46:17,980
去假装一个泰迪·沃克
this fake version of Teddy Walker,

2434
01:46:18,530 --> 01:46:21,280
以至于我忘了在学校学习的价值
that I forgot the value that went into learning in school.

2435
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:23,490
我要说诚实
I'm talking about honesty.

2436
01:46:23,740 --> 01:46:25,910
我要说接受你是谁
I'm talking about accepting who you are.

2437
01:46:26,370 --> 01:46:29,660
直到我遇到了我那些神奇的夜校同学
And it wasn't until I met my amazing night school classmates,

2438
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:34,290
和一位真正相信我的老师
and a teacher that actually believed in me,

2439
01:46:36,420 --> 01:46:38,840
能够接受我是谁
that I was able to accept who I was.

2440
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:43,800
作为一个有着多重学习障碍的大嗓门骗子
As a loudmouth hustler with a boatload of learning disabilities.

2441
01:46:53,770 --> 01:46:54,940
你们知道
You know,

2442
01:46:55,150 --> 01:46:58,690
对于任何一个试图第一次就做对的人
for any of you who may have struggled to get it right the first time,

2443
01:46:59,110 --> 01:47:01,110
我就是一个活生生的例子
then I am living proof

2444
01:47:01,610 --> 01:47:04,990
你仍有机会再次做好
that you can get it together on a second chance.

2445
01:47:05,780 --> 01:47:07,410
像我 试了很多次
I mean, I done had a lot of chances.

2446
01:47:08,830 --> 01:47:09,950
我搞砸了很多次
I messed up a lot.

2447
01:47:11,450 --> 01:47:13,790
但最终我做到了
But I made it to the other side.

2448
01:47:14,870 --> 01:47:17,040
我是说 我们都做到了 不是吗 夜校的学员们?
I mean, hell, we all did. Ain't that right, night school crew?

2449
01:47:17,130 --> 01:47:18,420
没错
Hell yeah.

2450
01:47:19,290 --> 01:47:20,420
非常对
Very true.

2451
01:47:20,590 --> 01:47:22,460
我们都有第二次机会
We all got second chances.

2452
01:47:22,630 --> 01:47:23,920
对我爸爸来说...
And to my dad...

2453
01:47:25,260 --> 01:47:27,720
他对我很严格 他说过一些话
He was tough on me. He said some things.

2454
01:47:27,890 --> 01:47:29,640
但那是爱
But he said it out of love.

2455
01:47:31,060 --> 01:47:32,930
爸爸 我知道你不是有意的
Dad, I know you ain't never mean it

2456
01:47:33,020 --> 01:47:35,430
你曾说过的那些老话
when you used to say some of the things that you used to say.

2457
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:37,060
你知道 你曾说
You know, you used to say stuff like,

2458
01:47:37,150 --> 01:47:39,270
“我希望我没你这个儿子”
"I wish I ain't never had you."

2459
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:43,480
或者 “这是浪费精子”
Or like, "That was a waste of sperm."

2460
01:47:44,860 --> 01:47:47,610
“哦 天啊 如果能把那个收回去” 我记得你说过那样的话
"Oh, God, if I could get that one back." I remember you said that.

2461
01:47:47,780 --> 01:47:49,620
但所有这些话都是因为爱
But all that stuff was said out of love

2462
01:47:49,700 --> 01:47:51,370
激励我 推动我
