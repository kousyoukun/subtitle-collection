170
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:46,480
my problem with you today is that

171
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,850
students like you bring down the

172
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,170
reputation of this high school you may

173
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,820
have their baby else at the school pool

174
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:53,470
but I know you're actually covering up

175
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,040
for the fective you're really just not

176
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,530

up using my brain and my bed as opposed

195
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:37,740
to when we went to high school now if

196

so Johnny finance the only thing was

204
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,270
really holding up this transition is me

205
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:16,500
not having my GED so I don't know I was

206
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:20,760

00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:41,130
have to go to night school to learn how

214
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,930
to pass the GED test and unfortunately

215
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:48,080

216
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:48,080

went to school together

236
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:47,110

237
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:48,940
and I did not want that element in here

238

the school better than any of us but

498
00:49:56,970 --> 00:50:04,910

555
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:57,580

01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:10,559
so much

560
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:50,900
it's not working

561
01:05:01,070 --> 01:05:25,410
Stewie about ten times what she pulled

562
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:28,760
up tell me

563
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:28,760
come come punch debate interface

564
01:05:53,660 --> 01:06:06,890
which is just a coincidence that I will

565
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:02,330
forget to truth

566
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:11,750
all right I know

567
01:09:05,780 --> 01:10:28,050
it was me go on a rainbow for the

568
01:10:13,470 --> 01:10:29,130
clothes Teddy Teddy Teddy you are too

569
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:30,930

570
01:10:29,130 --> 01:10:33,540
she didn't know I was going on a TV

571
01:10:30,930 --> 01:10:37,940
editing we had a right up till the end

572
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:37,940
and Teddy own brick head

573
01:10:42,350 --> 01:10:48,240
we've never taken on a project like that

574
01:10:44,930 --> 01:10:50,790
well I am an outside-of-the-box thinker

575
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:51,960
that's just who I am and I think that if

576
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:53,880
students are excited about their

577
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:56,490
environment they'll be excited about

578
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:59,130
learning that makes total sense I know I

579
01:10:56,490 --> 01:11:00,660
would I'm glad to hear it if you're

580
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:03,030
interested I'd love to come in toward

581
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:04,830
the school you could come by any day or

582
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:08,720
you know you can even come after school

583
01:11:04,830 --> 01:11:08,720
we have several night programs as well

584
01:11:26,230 --> 01:12:03,500
teacher at school used to be a special

585
01:11:59,869 --> 01:12:06,199
classroom when I hear it still me you

586
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:11,679
teach special it special day there's one

587
01:12:06,199 --> 01:12:11,679
of my sections my favorites actually

588
01:12:12,489 --> 01:12:15,530
you know that kid reminds me a lot of

589
01:12:14,810 --> 01:12:23,540
myself

590
01:12:15,530 --> 01:12:26,030
I can't imagine when I was in school I

591
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:29,150
know what you're doing Teddy and I admit

592
01:12:26,030 --> 01:12:33,139
it was very cool of you to take the fall

593
01:12:29,150 --> 01:12:35,570
for your classmates but your husband try

594
01:12:33,139 --> 01:12:38,630
to escape by without doing the work you

595
01:12:35,570 --> 01:12:41,480
should have been chaos for me I do okay

596
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:44,960
I do know that and I promise you I'm

597
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:47,179
done I'm not hustling no more night

598
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:49,280
school is about second chances

599
01:12:47,179 --> 01:12:50,659
if I would get this second chance and

600
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:56,949
it's over for me

601
01:12:50,659 --> 01:13:00,880
night school is all that I have please

602
01:12:56,949 --> 01:13:04,790
I'll consider it on one condition

603
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:15,400
we get you tested STDs that's not the

604
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:19,310
issue there was one time for learning

605
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:23,060
disabilities nobody cares about your

606
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:26,390
escapades which I'll be itches so what

607
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:28,929
are the test results Kerry Terry the

608
01:13:26,390 --> 01:13:28,929
issue is

609
01:13:41,949 --> 01:13:49,520
my suspicions were right and you my

610
01:13:44,659 --> 01:13:50,810
friend are dyslexic okay okay so that

611
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:52,070
just means I'm having problems with my

612
01:13:50,810 --> 01:13:54,679
reading them oh right right

613
01:13:52,070 --> 01:13:56,739
yep but you also have this calculus

614
01:13:54,679 --> 01:13:59,270
discount I don't even understand

615
01:13:56,739 --> 01:14:05,030
basically it's like this Lexia but with

616
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:07,670
math that's right I knew it what did you

617
01:14:05,030 --> 01:14:10,130
say it makes sense if you take me to a

618
01:14:07,670 --> 01:14:14,480
restaurant you said 10 I'm all over the

619

cancer

622
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:27,320

632
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:48,810
root of 81

633
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:26,060

642
01:18:46,690 --> 01:18:49,960
walking through the quad you're

643
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:51,969
clutching under your philosophy thesis

644
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:54,250
when you get to class the professor is

645
01:18:51,969 --> 01:18:55,960
blown away by how Brendan is so he

646
01:18:54,250 --> 01:18:58,270
perhaps on you and you can feel him up

647
01:18:55,960 --> 01:19:00,820
against your thigh not in a sexual way

648
01:18:58,270 --> 01:19:03,100
but not not a sexual way you know and he

649
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:04,570
looks strangely like Bruno Mars even

650
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:06,640
though he's super academic he wears like

651

825
01:40:59,239 --> 01:41:09,170
little something about me I'm Teddy

826
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:11,560
Walker and I'm a light the years I've

827
01:41:09,170 --> 01:41:15,650
been pretending to be somebody else

828
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:18,489
somebody that I'm not my reasons doing

829
01:41:15,650 --> 01:41:18,489
that is because I was ashamed

830
01:41:18,550 --> 01:41:24,590
I'll show you that I didn't learn like

831
01:41:20,870 --> 01:41:28,100
my classmates a shame that I couldn't

832
01:41:24,590 --> 01:41:31,639
take your tests ashamed that I let my

833
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:33,590
family or anything and I put so much

834
01:41:31,639 --> 01:41:34,880
time and energy into creating this fake

835
01:41:33,590 --> 01:41:37,969
version of tech Walker

836
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:40,750
I forgot the value that when it's in

837
01:41:37,969 --> 01:41:44,300
learning in school I'm talking about I'm

838
01:41:40,750 --> 01:41:46,130
talking about accepting who you are it

839
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:50,120
wasn't until I met my amazing nice

840
01:41:46,130 --> 01:41:54,830
school classmates and and a teacher that

841
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:59,080
