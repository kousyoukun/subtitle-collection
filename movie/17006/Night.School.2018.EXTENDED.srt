00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:14,819
這是我的頭髮
This is my hair

142
00:06:14,821 --> 00:06:16,188
你做到了，噓停下來
You did that, boo Stop

143
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,822
我要停下來
I'm just going to stop

144
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:18,991
你明白我想做什麼嗎
You get what I'm trying to do

145
00:06:18,993 --> 00:06:19,992
他嫉妒你的美貌
He's jealous of your beauty

146
00:06:19,994 --> 00:06:21,294
我搞砸了
I blew it

147
00:06:21,296 --> 00:06:22,997
我肯定搞砸了
I definitely blew that

148
00:06:24,898 --> 00:06:27,233
我踏上了新的春天...
I got a new spring in my step...

149
00:06:27,235 --> 00:06:28,367
哦，看，泰迪來了
Oh, look, there's Teddy

150
00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:29,834
泰迪！喲，泰迪！
Teddy! Yo, Teddy!

151
00:06:29,836 --> 00:06:31,971
看起來不錯
It's looking pretty good

152
00:06:31,973 --> 00:06:34,173
在前面
Up ahead

153
00:06:34,175 --> 00:06:36,142
我的名字叫泰迪，我是來製作的
My name is Teddy, and I am here to make

154
00:06:36,144 --> 00:06:37,443
你燒烤的夢想成真了
your barbecue dreams come true

155
00:06:37,445 --> 00:06:39,445
埃斯特，你是個小女人，
Now, Esther, you're a small woman,

156
00:06:39,447 --> 00:06:41,179
但是我知道你有一顆大心，
but I know you have a big heart,

157
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:43,516
這就是為什麼我向你推薦大鋼鐵
which is why I recommend the Big Steel for you

158
00:06:43,518 --> 00:06:45,551
沒有多少女人能承受這麼多的鋼鐵，
Not a lot of women can take this much steel,

159
00:06:45,553 --> 00:06:46,986
但是我知道你可以嗯！
but I know you can Mmm!

160
00:06:46,988 --> 00:06:49,087
皮特布爾，嗯？
The Pitbull, huh?

161
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:51,122
美洲駝？
□Como te llamas?
我駱駝皮布爾
Me llamo Pitbull

162
00:06:51,124 --> 00:06:53,525
戴爾!
!Dale!

163
00:06:53,527 --> 00:06:55,194
你不是西班牙人，是嗎？
You're not Spanish, are you?

164
00:06:55,196 --> 00:06:57,129
莫裡斯，我能從你的眼睛裡看到它
I can see it in your eyes, Morris

165
00:06:57,131 --> 00:06:58,531
但是我也可以告訴你妻子
But I can also tell that your wife

166
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:00,168
你知道，你妻子不在同一個頁面上
you know, your wife isn't on the same page

167
00:07:01,536 --> 00:07:03,268
我的意思是，這並不完全像她
I mean, it's not like she completely

168
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,869
控制錢包
controls the purse strings

169
00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:09,075
享受吧
Enjoy it

170
00:07:09,077 --> 00:07:11,009
不要讓我失望
Don't you let me down

171
00:07:13,348 --> 00:07:15,347
你最好停下來，夥計
You better stop it, man

172
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:16,381
你不開始嗎
Don't you start that

173
00:07:16,383 --> 00:07:18,050
那是一個大師班
That was a master class

174
00:07:18,052 --> 00:07:20,019
我不能讓鮑比·弗萊買那頭野獸
I couldn't get Bobby Flay to buy that beast

175
00:07:20,021 --> 00:07:22,087
你知道嗎？有一次我看到那個男人的錢包，
You know what? Once I saw the man purse,

176
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:24,089
那傢伙在我手裡油膩膩的，他真的是
the guy was putty in my hands He really was

177
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,925
泰迪，我只是想讓你知道
Teddy, I just want you to know

178
00:07:26,927 --> 00:07:29,361
你就像我從未有過的兒子
you are like the son I never had

179
00:07:29,363 --> 00:07:31,399
好吧，我的意思是，來吧，你有喬·朱尼爾
Well, I mean, come on, you got Joe Junior

180
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:35,368
嗯，是的，但是他是我的兒子，
Well, yeah, but he's the son I do have,

181
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,570
我只是沒有那麼瘋狂
and I'm just not all that crazy about it

182
00:07:37,572 --> 00:07:39,237
我是說，看看他
I mean, look at him

183
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:42,141
但是我的觀點是這些年前，
But my point is this all those years ago,

184
00:07:42,143 --> 00:07:44,610
我碰上了一個滿臉青春痘的少年
I took a chance on a pimply-faced teenager

185
00:07:44,612 --> 00:07:47,212
我的小加裡·科爾曼
My little Gary Coleman

186
00:07:47,214 --> 00:07:48,614
我的小韋伯斯特
My little Webster

187
00:07:48,616 --> 00:07:52,050
結果對我們倆來說都很棒
And it turned out great for both of us

188
00:07:52,052 --> 00:07:55,123
所以我決定，當我退休的時候
So I've decided, when I retire

189
00:07:56,491 --> 00:07:58,591
我要去燒烤城
I'm turning Barbecue City

190
00:07:58,593 --> 00:08:01,926
超過...敬你
over... to you

191
00:08:01,928 --> 00:08:03,595
對不起？
Excuse me?

192
00:08:03,597 --> 00:08:05,330
什麼？
What?

193
00:08:05,332 --> 00:08:07,233
呃，不要——不要操我
Uh, don't-don't shit me

194
00:08:07,235 --> 00:08:08,334
我是認真的
I'm serious

195
00:08:08,336 --> 00:08:10,001
哦，我的上帝，喬
Oh, my God, Joe

196
00:08:10,003 --> 00:08:11,403
我只是起了雞皮疙瘩
I just got-got goose bumps

197
00:08:11,405 --> 00:08:13,872
是的！我渾身起雞皮疙瘩
Yes! I got goose bumps all over

198
00:08:13,874 --> 00:08:15,373
我不知道該說什麼，夥計，謝謝你
I don't know what to say, man Thank you

199
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,108
不，謝謝
No. Thank you

200
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,477
兒子
son

201
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,646
喬，你在說什麼？
What you talkin' 'bout, Joe?

202
00:08:20,648 --> 00:08:22,881
你得過來，德拉蒙德先生
You gotta come here, Mr. Drummond

203
00:08:22,883 --> 00:08:23,917
來這裡
Come here

204
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:27,054
都是你的，泰迪
All yours, Teddy

205
00:08:28,455 --> 00:08:29,988
你怎麼想呢?哦
What do you think? Oh

206
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,590
太棒了
It's amazing

207
00:08:31,592 --> 00:08:32,525
真的嗎？是
Really? Yeah

208
00:08:32,527 --> 00:08:34,993
但是作為你的非官方財務顧問，
But as your unofficial financial advisor,

209
00:08:34,995 --> 00:08:36,294
我有義務告訴你
I'm obligated to tell you

210
00:08:36,296 --> 00:08:38,296
這枚戒指超出了你的預算
that this ring is way out of your budget

211
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:39,564
放鬆
Relax

212
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:40,598
麗莎很酷
Lisa's cool as hell

213
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,000
她知道你是誰
She knows who you are

214
00:08:42,002 --> 00:08:43,636
麗莎不知道我是誰
Lisa does not know who I am

215
00:08:43,638 --> 00:08:46,338
麗莎知道我是一名成功的烤肉推銷員
Lisa knows that I'm a successful barbecue salesman

216
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,173
馬文知道泰迪高中輟學
Marvin knows that Teddy's a high school dropout

217
00:08:48,175 --> 00:08:50,208
那是一份又一份的生活薪水
that's living paycheck to paycheck

218
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,243
因為我和一個遠遠超過我體重的女人在一起
cause I'm with a woman that's way above my weight class

219
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:54,613
你的生活是建立在一個由卡片組成的金融機構之上的
Your life is built on a financial house of cards

220
00:08:54,615 --> 00:08:56,649
停下保時捷，雙面人
Stop it The Porsche, the duplex

221
00:08:56,651 --> 00:08:58,684
你想證明什麼？
What are you trying to prove?

222
00:08:58,686 --> 00:09:00,185
另外，每次我們出去，
Plus, every single time we go out,

223
00:09:00,187 --> 00:09:01,553
她提出支付支票
she offers to pay for the check

224
00:09:01,555 --> 00:09:03,254
我讓她放下塑料的那天
The day that I let her put down her plastic

225
00:09:03,256 --> 00:09:04,422
是我失去她的那一天
is the day that I lose her

226
00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:06,692
你知道我不知道我為什麼這麼緊張
And you know that I don't know why I was so nervous

227
00:09:06,694 --> 00:09:08,093
一起來了嘿
It's coming together Hey

228
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,627
嗨，麗莎
Hi Lisa

229
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:11,463
嗨！比安弗尼
Hi! Bienvenue

230
00:09:11,465 --> 00:09:14,366
夥計，麗莎是我經歷過的最好的事情
Dude, Lisa's the best thing that ever happened to me

231
00:09:14,368 --> 00:09:17,134
我不想搞砸這個，夥計
I don't want to mess this one up, man

232
00:09:17,136 --> 00:09:19,003
我告訴他們是他幹的
I told them He did

233
00:09:19,005 --> 00:09:20,271
他真的這麼說了
He actually said that

234
00:09:20,273 --> 00:09:21,706
看那個
Ooh Look at that

235
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,041
看起來很棒一些甜點
That looks amazing Some dessert

236
00:09:23,043 --> 00:09:24,242
哇。謝謝你
Wow Wow. Thank you

237
00:09:24,244 --> 00:09:26,211
嗯。-非常感謝克萊蒙大廚也說
Mmm. - Thank you so much Chef Clemont also said

238
00:09:26,213 --> 00:09:27,412
沒有支票
that there will be no check

239
00:09:27,414 --> 00:09:29,647
這全在他身上
This is all on him

240
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:31,516
哇，我知道他會試試這個
Wow I knew he would try this

241
00:09:31,518 --> 00:09:33,518
你知道嗎？告訴他我很感激，
You know what? Tell him I appreciate it,

242
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,120
但是我堅持付錢好嗎
but I insist on paying Okay

243
00:09:35,122 --> 00:09:36,454
好吧，好吧，等等
Yeah Okay, well, just wait

244
00:09:36,456 --> 00:09:38,323
等等，親愛的
Well, hold on, now, honey

245
00:09:38,325 --> 00:09:39,457
親愛的，你不想冒犯他
Honey, you don't want to offend him

246
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:41,058
你是他的客人，對吧？
You're his guest, right?

247
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,527
相信我，你從來沒有從客戶那裡免費吃一頓飯
Trust me, you never take a free meal from a client

248
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:43,661
這樣，你就不欠他們任何東西了
That way, you don't owe them anything

249
00:09:43,663 --> 00:09:45,263
這是真的謝謝你，麗莎
That's true Thank you, Lisa

250
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:46,364
我很感激你知道嗎
I appreciate it You know

251
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:47,532
嗯，只要你準備好了
Um Whenever you're ready

252
00:09:47,534 --> 00:09:49,066
謝謝你
Thank you

253
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:50,635
你知道嗎？你知道嗎，寶貝？
You know what? You know what, then, baby?

254
00:09:50,637 --> 00:09:52,136
如果是這樣，親愛的，那就讓我來
If that's the case, sweetie, then let me

255
00:09:52,138 --> 00:09:53,504
不，寶貝，這是我的東西
No. Baby, this is my thing

256
00:09:53,506 --> 00:09:55,340
我們有八個人我懂了
There's like eight of us I got it

257
00:09:55,342 --> 00:09:57,142
你可以把它註銷，對吧？是
You can probably write it off, right? Yes

258
00:09:57,144 --> 00:09:59,344
我沒有想到這是商業開支
I didn't think about that It is a business expense

259
00:09:59,346 --> 00:10:00,612
好吧。-是啊，來吧
Okay. - Yeah Come on

260
00:10:00,614 --> 00:10:02,045
W - W -等待，等待等待等待等待，LIS
W-W-Wait, wait Hold-hold up, Lis

261
00:10:02,047 --> 00:10:04,448
這是商業開支，但是，李斯
It is a business expense, but, Lis

262
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,418
很明顯，泰迪真的想請客
it's clear that Teddy really wants to treat

263
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,188
我們都在這裡慶祝你，所以讓他來吧
We're all here celebrating you, so let him

264
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:13,223
對吧，泰迪？
Right, Teddy?

265
00:10:13,225 --> 00:10:14,692
是
Yes

266
00:10:14,694 --> 00:10:15,760
魔獸世界
Wow

267
00:10:15,762 --> 00:10:18,530
是的。為什麼我們不更近？
Yes. Wh-Why aren't we closer?

268
00:10:18,532 --> 00:10:19,764
因為你抓到我了
'Cause you get me
嗯
Mmm

269
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:21,433
我有。我明白了
I have it. I got it

270
00:10:21,435 --> 00:10:22,634
我愛你愛你
I love you Love you back

271
00:10:22,636 --> 00:10:24,001
黑色愛情
Black love

272
00:10:24,003 --> 00:10:25,369
行
Okay

273
00:10:25,371 --> 00:10:27,237
哦，媽的
Oh, shit

274
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:28,405
好吧，馬文，打我
All right, Marvin, hit me

275
00:10:28,407 --> 00:10:29,641
謝謝你
Thank you

276
00:10:29,643 --> 00:10:31,743
這是我最喜歡的事情之一，他做了
This is so good One of my favorite things that he does

277
00:10:31,745 --> 00:10:33,478
那個焦糖餡餅，他以此聞名
That caramel tart, he's known for it All right

278
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,447
哦，我得進去

太神奇了，這些不是很漂亮嗎？
So amazing Aren't these beautiful?

282

他做這些只是為了我們真的嗎？
He did these just for us Really?

283
00:10:41,454 --> 00:10:43,121
是的，你應該嘗嘗這個焦糖
Yeah You should try this caramel

284
00:10:43,123 --> 00:10:44,255
我要去...我要吃一點

我知道那麼多，但我能知道些什麼...給我
I know that much, but what tell me about... give me

289
00:10:51,063 --> 00:10:52,029
椅子背後的音樂
the Behind the Music about the chair

290
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,263
假裝我在VH1或類似的地方
Pretend I'm on VH1 or something like that

291
00:10:53,265 --> 00:10:55,400
事實上，這些椅子有一個非常有趣的故事
Well, actually, these chairs have a very interesting story

292
00:10:55,402 --> 00:10:56,768
他們來自丹麥
They're from Denmark

293
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,770
在倉庫裡發現的
Found them in a warehouse Whoa

294
00:10:58,772 --> 00:11:01,438
世紀中葉，現代，有點圓
Mid-century, modern, kind of rounded

295
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,372
是啊，是啊，是啊，是啊

296

我知道它是藍色的
I know it's blue and

297
00:11:03,576 --> 00:11:05,476
我不知道你這麼喜歡椅子
I didn't know you were so into chairs

298
00:11:05,478 --> 00:11:06,578
哦，你不會相信我會回家，
Oh, you would not believe I'll go home,

299
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,779
我看看我的椅子，一會兒我就被打開了
I'll look at my chair, I get turned on in a second

300
00:11:07,781 --> 00:11:09,814
這只是一種奇怪的戀物癖，你會喜歡這些，因為
It's just a weird fetish You would love these because

301
00:11:09,816 --> 00:11:12,282
我不知道你是否注意到了藍寶石
I don't know if you noticed the cerulean kind of

302
00:11:12,284 --> 00:11:13,617
壁紙的底色
undertone of the wallpaper Woof

303
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:16,220
但是我們有點想把它們綁在一起，
but we kind of wanted to tie it all together,

304
00:11:16,222 --> 00:11:18,089
抵消了更硬、更直的線，
to kind of offset the harder, more straighter lines,

305
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:19,624
那是什麼？i

307
00:11:21,561 --> 00:11:23,160

308
00:11:23,964 --> 00:11:25,797
哦，我的上帝！
Oh, my God!

309
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:28,065
不不不！什麼？
No, no, no! What?

310
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:29,801
先生，甜點有問題嗎？
Is there a problem with the dessert, sir?

311
00:11:29,803 --> 00:11:31,503
我想那是蛋糕裡的陰毛
I think that's pubic hair in the cake

312
00:11:31,505 --> 00:11:33,070
哦，我的上帝哦，我的上帝
Oh, my God Oh, my gosh

313
00:11:33,072 --> 00:11:34,505
這陰毛在我該死的甜點裡嗎？
Is this pubic hair in my damn dessert?

314
00:11:34,507 --> 00:11:35,341
我可以嗎？
May I?

315
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,376
對不起，什麼？我可以接受嗎？
I'm sorry, what? May I please take it?

316
00:11:39,378 --> 00:11:41,178
真的，我告訴你是什麼
Literally, I'm telling you what it is

317
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,114
呃

這太多陰毛了
This is way too many pubes

319
00:11:51,156 --> 00:11:52,256
這是什麼意思？
What does that mean?

320
00:11:52,258 --> 00:11:53,625
我的意思是，一個太多陰毛了
I mean, one is too many pubes

321
00:11:53,627 --> 00:11:55,158
如果你能告訴廚師

我相信這些是你種的
I believe you planted these

324
00:11:58,531 --> 00:12:00,764
不，不，不，不，你剛才說什麼？
No, no, no What'd you just say?

325
00:12:00,766 --> 00:12:02,599

我認識這個人一輩子了
I've known this man my entire life

327
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,504
他不是酒吧種植者，先生，不，不，不

我冒著生命危險來到這個國家
I risked my life coming to this country

331
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:13,644
所以我可以在某個隨意的傢伙的芝士蛋糕上種植陰毛？
so I can plant pubes on some random guy's cheesecake?

332
00:12:13,646 --> 00:12:15,212
我不知道你喜歡什麼，夥計
I don't know what you're into, man

333
00:12:15,214 --> 00:12:16,880

一個非洲裔美國人

338
00:12:25,658 --> 00:12:28,224
哦，該死什麼？這是種族主義，夥計
Oh, shit What? That's racist, man

339

00:15:03,047 --> 00:15:04,647
我很緊張，寶貝
I was nervous, babe

415
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:06,750
我不知道你會聞到我試圖聞到的味道
I didn't know you'd smell it I tried to

416
00:15:06,752 --> 00:15:08,417
不，那是，嗯
No, that's, um

417
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:10,352
實際的...比如丙烷？
Actual... like, the propane?

418
00:15:10,354 --> 00:15:11,487
你為什麼不站在外面，
Why don't you go stand outside,

419
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:13,789
我會把所有東西都放在這裡，我會帶你回家
I'll situate everything in here, and I'll get you home

420
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:14,957
好吧，愛你
Okay Love you

421
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,325
準備好
Be ready

422
00:15:16,327 --> 00:15:17,561
嗯
Mm-hmm

423
00:15:17,563 --> 00:15:19,295
所以，夥計們
So, guys

424
00:15:19,297 --> 00:15:22,800
我可愛的小泰迪熊剛剛提出了這個問題
my sweet little Teddy Bear just popped the question

425
00:15:26,804 --> 00:15:27,972
大驚喜
And big surprise

426
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:32,776
我答應了！
I said yes!

427
00:15:32,778 --> 00:15:34,543
媽的！
Shit!

428
00:15:40,718 --> 00:15:43,720
哦，媽的。哦，媽的！
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

429
00:15:43,722 --> 00:15:45,554
哦，上帝！嬰兒
Oh, God! Baby

430
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,392
泰迪，你沒事吧？
Teddy, are you okay?

431
00:15:50,394 --> 00:15:53,429
我需要你告訴我未婚妻
I need you to tell my fiancee there's

432
00:15:53,431 --> 00:15:54,998
發生了一起事故
there's been an accident

433
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,933
寶貝，是我
Baby, it's me

434
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:59,635
你能看見我嗎？泰迪？
Can you see me? Teddy?

435
00:15:59,637 --> 00:16:01,537
我是你的未婚妻
I'm your fiancee

436
00:16:01,539 --> 00:16:02,905
好的
Good

437
00:16:02,907 --> 00:16:04,874
我出事了
I've been in an accident

438
00:16:04,876 --> 00:16:06,076
哦，寶貝
Oh, baby

439
00:16:09,914 --> 00:16:12,481
所以，喬沒有保險？
So, Joe didn't have insurance?

440
00:16:12,483 --> 00:16:14,016
是的，他當然有，馬伕
Yeah, of course he did, Marv

441
00:16:14,018 --> 00:16:16,118
他拿錢跑到佛羅里達去了
He took the money and ran off to Florida

442
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,487
夥計，我一直在到處找工作，夥計
Dude, I've been looking for a job everywhere, man

443
00:16:18,489 --> 00:16:20,689
但是沒有像樣的銷售工作
But there are no decent sales jobs for

444
00:16:20,691 --> 00:16:22,491
燒烤城最佳員工
an Employee of the Month at Barbecue City

445
00:16:22,493 --> 00:16:24,827
我們會在這裡僱用你，但是你需要得到你的GED
We'd hire you here, but you need to get your GED

446
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:27,462
想想看，這些傢伙扯淡客戶
Think about it These guys bullshit clients

447
00:16:27,464 --> 00:16:29,698
一整天都在談論他們不瞭解的資金
all day about funds they don't understand

448
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,533
你是天生的
You would be a natural

449
00:16:30,535 --> 00:16:31,801
所以你是說如果我畢業了
So you're saying that if I graduated

450
00:16:31,803 --> 00:16:34,570
高中畢業後，你能在這裡給我找份工作嗎？是
from high school, that then you could get me a job here? Yeah

451
00:16:34,572 --> 00:16:36,872
但是你討厭學校，那我們為什麼還要上學呢
But you hate school, so why are we even having

452
00:16:36,874 --> 00:16:38,741
這個對話？不，不，不，我不說話
this conversation? No, no, no. I'm not talking

453
00:16:38,743 --> 00:16:39,975
關於上學
about going to school

454
00:16:39,977 --> 00:16:41,610
我在說我的GED
I'm talking about getting my GED

455
00:16:41,612 --> 00:16:42,845
這是不同的
And that's different

456
00:16:42,847 --> 00:16:44,080
看，為了得到我的GED，
See, to get my GED,

457
00:16:44,082 --> 00:16:45,948
我要做的就是去學校，
all I gotta do is go to the school,

458
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,149
稍微迷住校長
charm the principal a little bit

459
00:16:47,151 --> 00:16:48,984
對吧？得到我想要的
Right? Get what I want Yeah

460
00:16:48,986 --> 00:16:51,519
這是我的GED聽起來很簡單，Marv
Which is my GED Sounds pretty easy to me, Marv

461
00:16:51,521 --> 00:16:54,490
如果你拿到了GED，嗯？
If you got your GED Huh?

462
00:16:54,492 --> 00:16:56,492
我可能會給你掛電話
I could probably hook you up

463
00:16:56,494 --> 00:16:58,027
聽我說，儘管停下來。停下，好嗎？
Listen to me, though Stop it. Stop, okay?

464
00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:00,395
幫個忙，不要告訴麗莎這件事
Do yourself a favor, and do not tell Lisa about this

465
00:17:00,397 --> 00:17:01,764
直到達成協議
until it's a done deal

466
00:17:01,766 --> 00:17:04,166
現在，你知道我比那更聰明了，Marv
Now, you know I'm smarter than that, Marv

467
00:17:04,168 --> 00:17:05,835
你會成為一名金融分析師嗎？
You're gonna be a financial analyst?

468
00:17:05,837 --> 00:17:07,469
是的，我是
Yes, I am

469
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:09,572
我是，寶貝，它馬上就開始了
I am, babe, and it starts immediately

470
00:17:09,574 --> 00:17:12,074
我和Marv談過了，他說他們真的可以用
I was talking to Marv, and he says that they could really use

471
00:17:12,076 --> 00:17:13,876
在他的公司裡有我這樣的人
somebody with my skill set at his firm

472
00:17:13,878 --> 00:17:15,077
太好了
That's great

473
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,611
這是一個很好的機會
That's a great opportunity

474
00:17:16,613 --> 00:17:19,182
嗯...是啊，我是說，我
Um... yeah, I mean, I'm-I'm

475
00:17:19,184 --> 00:17:22,051
我對此基本上很興奮，你知道嗎？
I'm basically pumped up about it, you know?

476
00:17:22,053 --> 00:17:23,619
你很有彈性，寶貝
You are so resilient, baby Mmm

477
00:17:23,621 --> 00:17:25,720
你不停地反彈，我為你感到驕傲
You keep bouncing back I am so proud of you

478
00:17:25,722 --> 00:17:26,889
是
Yep

479
00:17:26,891 --> 00:17:28,123
我愛你
I love you

480
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,727
我也愛你
I love you, too

481
00:17:33,931 --> 00:17:36,131
媽，丁字褲當然會
Ma, of course the thong is gonna

482
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:37,900
在戰利品洞裡砍你
cut you in the booty hole

483
00:17:37,902 --> 00:17:39,834
這就是它做的看，下次里昂
That's what it do Look, next time Leon

484
00:17:39,836 --> 00:17:42,004
你告訴他，想給某人穿丁字褲
want to stick somebody in a thong, you tell him

485
00:17:42,006 --> 00:17:44,139
他需要戴上它並得到一面鏡子
that he need to put it on and get a mirror

486
00:17:44,141 --> 00:17:45,774
看看他的球做了什麼
and check and see what his balls do

487
00:17:45,776 --> 00:17:48,743
我不在乎他是否是你的牧師
I don't care if he is your pastor

488
00:17:48,745 --> 00:17:52,147
會眾知道他是那樣的怪胎嗎？
Do the congregation know he a freak like that?

489
00:17:53,718 --> 00:17:55,084
堅持住，媽媽
Hold on, Mama

490
00:17:55,086 --> 00:17:56,886
先生，我能幫你嗎？
Can I help you, sir?

491
00:17:56,888 --> 00:17:58,620
嗯
Um

492
00:17:58,622 --> 00:18:02,057
我忍不住偷聽了你的談話
I couldn't help but overhear your conversation

493
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:03,992
對不起？你有點大聲
Excuse me? You kind of loud

494
00:18:03,994 --> 00:18:05,628
那就下車吧
Well, then get out of my car

495
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,129
我不在你的車裡，我很明顯在我的車裡
I'm not in your car I'm clearly in my car

496
00:18:07,131 --> 00:18:09,530
不，你在我車裡，你說話聲音夠大的
No, you're in my car You're speaking loud enough

497
00:18:09,532 --> 00:18:11,133
你是什麼，音量控制警察？
What are you, the volume control police?

498
00:18:11,135 --> 00:18:12,467
我不確定這是否是一件事
I'm not sure if that's even a thing

499
00:18:12,469 --> 00:18:13,601
別管閒事
Mind your business

500
00:18:13,603 --> 00:18:15,103
你的生意正成為我的生意
Your business is becoming my business

501
00:18:15,105 --> 00:18:16,604
你為什麼不在擋風玻璃上工作？
Why don't you work on your windshield?

502
00:18:16,606 --> 00:18:17,973
現在你真的是我的生意
Now you're really in my business

503
00:18:17,975 --> 00:18:18,974
可能看起來像萬花筒
Probably look like a kaleidoscope

504
00:18:18,976 --> 00:18:20,142
當你仔細看的時候
when you look through it

505
00:18:20,144 --> 00:18:21,542
你知道，你為什麼不乾脆...？
You know, why don't you just...?

506
00:18:21,544 --> 00:18:22,510
你可能覺得自己像只小蜜蜂
You probably feel like a little honeybee

507
00:18:22,512 --> 00:18:24,646
足夠一次看18件事，
Enough Looking at 18 things at one time,

508
00:18:24,648 --> 00:18:26,514
但實際上你只是在看一件事
but really you're just looking at one thing

509
00:18:26,516 --> 00:18:27,715
我...我...我現在就去做你的生意
I-I-I'm gonna get in your business now

510
00:18:27,717 --> 00:18:30,485
告訴你媽媽，她可以去買一盒G弦
Tell your mother that she can go buy a box of G-strings

511
00:18:30,487 --> 00:18:31,787
用她噁心的屁股
with her nasty ass

512
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:33,088
你現在在說我媽媽？
You're talking about my mama now?

513
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,090
任何牧師在他的球上穿丁字褲
Any pastor that's putting a thong on his balls

514
00:18:35,092 --> 00:18:36,524
上帝是不對的
ain't right with God

515
00:18:36,526 --> 00:18:38,192
噓。什麼？不要噓我
Pssh. What? Don't pssh me

516
00:18:38,194 --> 00:18:39,594
嘶
Pssh

517
00:18:40,597 --> 00:18:41,997
是
Yeah

518
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:45,034
我打賭那會傷到你的喉嚨
I bet that hurt your throat

519
00:18:45,036 --> 00:18:46,235
開你的車
Drive your car

520
00:18:46,237 --> 00:18:47,202
什麼，媽媽？
What, Mama?

521
00:18:47,204 --> 00:18:48,270
你媽媽很討厭
Your mother's nasty

522
00:18:48,272 --> 00:18:50,171
女孩，是啊，那是一隻被燒焦的小妖精
Girl, yeah, that's a little ol' burnt leprechaun

523
00:18:50,173 --> 00:18:53,208
在我們的談話中，坐在我旁邊，看著這該死的燈
sitting next to me at this damn light all in our conversation

524
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,911
對不起？嘿，不，女孩，你知道他沒有金子
Excuse me? Hey Nah, girl, you know he ain't got no gold

525
00:18:55,913 --> 00:18:57,079
你知道他沒有金子
You know he ain't got no gold

526
00:18:57,081 --> 00:18:58,247
你長大了怎麼樣？再見，噓！
How about you grow up? Bye, boo!

527
00:18:58,249 --> 00:18:59,847
嘿
Hey

528
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:01,950
說話...說到烤麵包，如果你...？
Speak... speaking of toast, if you...?

529
00:19:01,952 --> 00:19:03,818
該死，泰迪
Goddamn it, Teddy

530
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,119
我要工作嘿，喲！
I gotta work Hey, yo!

531
00:19:05,121 --> 00:19:06,621
你按誰的喇叭...？我們走吧！
Who you honk...? Let's go!

532
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,057
我甚至看不到我的鏡子在哪裡？
I can't even see Where's my mirror?

533
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:10,591
喲，夥計！嘿，你在按誰的喇叭？
Yo, man! Hey, who you honking at?

534
00:19:26,843 --> 00:19:28,642
所以，再次對系統進行遊戲，
So, game the system again,

535
00:19:28,644 --> 00:19:29,812
是嗎，泰迪？

536
00:19:29,814 --> 00:19:31,713
斯圖爾特，你有什麼問題嗎？
Stewart, what is your problem with me?

537
00:19:31,715 --> 00:19:33,881
泰迪，我對你的問題是學生喜歡你
My problem with you, Teddy, is that students like you

538
00:19:33,883 --> 00:19:35,817
降低這所高中的聲譽
bring down the reputation of this high school

539
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:37,185
你可能還有其他人
You may have everybody else

540
00:19:37,187 --> 00:19:38,853
在這所學校被愚弄了，但我知道
at this school fooled, but I know

541
00:19:38,855 --> 00:19:40,254
你實際上是在掩蓋事實
you're actually covering up for the fact

542
00:19:40,256 --> 00:19:42,091
你真的沒那麼聰明
that you're really just not that smart

543
00:19:42,093 --> 00:19:44,559
事實上，你可能是這所學校最笨的學生
In fact, you might be the dumbest student at this school

544
00:19:44,561 --> 00:19:46,261
哦
Uh-oh

545
00:19:46,263 --> 00:19:48,997
是啊
Yeah  -  Uh-oh

哦
Uh-oh

547
00:19:55,172 --> 00:19:57,972
我是音樂老師
I am the music teacher

548
00:19:57,974 --> 00:20:00,908
我對生物學教學一竅不通
I don't know the first thing about teaching biology

549
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,844
哦，看在上帝的份上！
Oh, for God's sakes!

550
00:20:02,846 --> 00:20:05,613
沒有音樂節目的哪一部分
What part of there is no musical program

551
00:20:05,615 --> 00:20:07,149
你不明白嗎，崔西？
do you not understand, Trish?

552
00:20:07,151 --> 00:20:09,050
沒有人會進入常春籐盟校
Nobody's getting into Ivy League schools

553
00:20:09,052 --> 00:20:10,818
靠巴松管獎學金哦，媽的
on a bassoon scholarship Oh, shit

554
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,687
你知道，我不聰明
You know, I'm not book smart

555
00:20:12,689 --> 00:20:14,322
斯圖爾特比我聰明
Stewart's smarter than me

556
00:20:14,324 --> 00:20:16,024
但是你知道我不是什麼嗎？
But you know what I'm not?

557
00:20:16,026 --> 00:20:17,725
我不是天生的怪胎，斯圖
I'm not a freak of nature, Stew

558
00:20:17,727 --> 00:20:18,993
哦，斯圖
Uh-oh, Stew

559
00:20:18,995 --> 00:20:20,362
別這樣，泰迪
Don't do this, Teddy

560
00:20:20,364 --> 00:20:22,296
嘿，快問大家
Hey, quick question, everybody

561
00:20:22,298 --> 00:20:25,133
這裡有人見過斯圖爾特脫下襯衫嗎？
Has anybody here ever seen Stewart with his shirt off?

562
00:20:25,135 --> 00:20:27,335
這是胎記這是胎記！
It's a birthmark It's a birthmark!

563
00:20:27,337 --> 00:20:29,737
如果是胎記，讓我們現在就去看看，證明一下
If it's a birthmark, let us see it right now Prove it

564
00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:31,739
你們都想看我的胎記嗎？
You all want to see my birthmark?

565
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:32,807
是的！來吧！我快死了！
Yes! Come on! I'm dying!

566
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:34,008
我會證明的。看到了嗎？
I'll prove it. See?

567
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,779
這是胎記！
It's a birthmark!

568
00:20:38,781 --> 00:20:41,014
你胸口上有個豬屁股，夥計
You got a pig's butthole on your chest, man

569
00:20:41,016 --> 00:20:43,151
裡面沒有洞，那怎麼可能是一個炮眼呢？
There's no hole in it, so how could it be a butthole?

570
00:20:43,153 --> 00:20:45,153
你有第三個乳頭，夥計！
You got a third nipple, man!

571
00:20:45,155 --> 00:20:46,888
誰是下一個，多洛雷斯？
Who's next, Dolores?

572
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,825
這個年輕人就在這裡
This young man right here

573
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,264
嘿。怎麼了，斯圖爾特？
Hey. What's up, Stewart?

574
00:20:55,165 --> 00:20:57,965
我們過得很愉快，不是嗎？
We had good times, didn't we?

575
00:20:57,967 --> 00:21:00,902
我笑我們笑得多厲害
I laugh at how much we laughed

576
00:21:00,904 --> 00:21:03,173
那是一些
That's some

577
00:21:09,979 --> 00:21:11,279
所以，呃
So, uh

578
00:21:11,281 --> 00:21:13,314
你當校長多久了，夥計？
how long you been the principal, man?

579
00:21:13,316 --> 00:21:14,714
持續兩年
Going on two years

580
00:21:14,716 --> 00:21:16,350
哇，是啊。不容易，
Wow Yeah. Wasn't easy,

581
00:21:16,352 --> 00:21:20,822
但是，呃，用我的大腦和球棒清理了這個地方
but, uh, cleaned this place up using my brain and my bat

582
00:21:20,824 --> 00:21:22,990
與我們上高中的時候相反，
As opposed to when we went to high school,

583
00:21:22,992 --> 00:21:25,293
現在，如果你有D平均數，你就出局了
now, if you have a D average, you're out

584
00:21:25,295 --> 00:21:26,860
你能做到嗎？
Can you do that?

585
00:21:26,862 --> 00:21:28,297
泰迪，我可以做任何我想做的事
I can do whatever I want, Teddy

586
00:21:29,433 --> 00:21:31,199
這是我的房子
This my house

587
00:21:31,201 --> 00:21:33,835
對不起，最後一部分是什麼？
I'm sorry, what what was that last part?

588
00:21:33,837 --> 00:21:34,938
我說看看你周圍
I said look around you

589
00:21:35,904 --> 00:21:39,407
這是...我的
This is... my

590
00:21:39,409 --> 00:21:41,377
房子
house

591
00:21:43,446 --> 00:21:45,879
對不起，我問一下，你的聲音是黑色的嗎？
Excuse me for asking, but are you doing a black voice?

592
00:21:45,881 --> 00:21:48,048
不，不，不是黑色的聲音
No, no. Not a black voice

593
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,950
你確定？我聽不到顏色
You sure? I don't hear color

594
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:53,020
嗯，沃克先生，是什麼讓你回到皮埃蒙特？
Mmm What brings you back to Piedmont, Mr. Walker?

595
00:21:53,022 --> 00:21:55,857
現在，我正在從一份令人驚歎的銷售工作轉變過來
Right now I'm transitioning from an amazing job in sales

596
00:21:55,859 --> 00:21:57,858
金融領域的工作，唯一的
to a job in finance, and the only thing

597
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,826
這真的阻礙了這種轉變
that's really holding up this transition

598
00:21:59,828 --> 00:22:02,295
我沒有GED嗎
is me not having my GED

599
00:22:02,297 --> 00:22:04,264
所以，我不知道，我在想也許我可以
So, I don't know, I was thinking maybe I could

600
00:22:04,266 --> 00:22:06,400
讓你穿過一些T，點一些我的
get you to cross some T's, dot some I's

601
00:22:06,402 --> 00:22:08,269
也許你可以
Maybe you could do

602
00:22:08,271 --> 00:22:10,204
對老朋友的恩惠
a favor for an old friend

603
00:22:10,206 --> 00:22:12,273
有些事情永遠不會改變，嗯，泰迪？
Some things just never change, huh, Teddy?

604
00:22:12,275 --> 00:22:14,107
你想讓我幫你嗎
You want me to help you

605
00:22:14,109 --> 00:22:17,311
找到獲得文憑的捷徑
find a shortcut to getting your diploma

606
00:22:17,313 --> 00:22:18,446
不
No

607
00:22:18,448 --> 00:22:19,880
是
Yes

608
00:22:19,882 --> 00:22:21,415
嗯
Hmm

609
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:24,050
我希望我能。我真的喜歡
I wish I could. I really do

610
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:25,385
但是你得走了
But you would have to go

611
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:28,755
去夜校學習如何通過GED考試，
to night school to learn how to pass the GED test,

612
00:22:28,757 --> 00:22:31,292
不幸的是，我們這裡不提供夜校
and unfortunately we don't offer night school here

613
00:22:31,294 --> 00:22:33,727
我很抱歉，泰迪
I'm so sorry, Teddy

614
00:22:33,729 --> 00:22:35,431
讓我帶你出去
Let me walk you out

615
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,866
你想摸她嗎？
You want to touch her?

616
00:22:39,868 --> 00:22:41,801
對不起？開始
I'm sorry? Come on

617
00:22:41,803 --> 00:22:43,970
摸摸我的大黑球棒
Touch my big black bat

618
00:22:43,972 --> 00:22:46,106
嗯，不，我是
Um, no, I'm

619
00:22:46,108 --> 00:22:48,243
說吧，打招呼
Go ahead, say hi

620
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:53,414
啊！
Ah!

621
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:56,217
你以前叫我瘋狂斯圖爾特
You used to call me Crazy Stewart

622
00:22:56,219 --> 00:22:59,788
現在你叫我蝙蝠俠
Now you call me Batman

623
00:23:05,195 --> 00:23:06,927
去除安德烈的節拍，魯迪
Remove the Beats by Andre, Rudy

624
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:08,862
學校政策校園內不戴耳機
School policy no headphones on campus

625
00:23:08,864 --> 00:23:10,464
除非你用的是羅塞塔石碑
unless you're using Rosetta Stone

626
00:23:10,466 --> 00:23:12,832
嘿，呃...嘿，斯圖，你認為你在服用
Hey, uh... hey, Stew, you think you're taking

627
00:23:12,834 --> 00:23:14,868
和這些孩子在一起的正確方法？
the right approach here with these kids?

628
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,469
他們看起來有點緊張，夥計
They look a little stressed out, man

629
00:23:16,471 --> 00:23:19,540
我正在為現實世界做準備，泰迪，好嗎？
I am preparing them for the real world, Teddy, okay?

630
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:21,775
我可能不是他們最好的朋友，
I may not be their best friend,

631
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:23,777
但是這裡的每個人都尊重我好嗎
but everyone here respects me Okay

632
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:26,012
什麼他媽的，斯圖爾特？嘿，嘿，嘿，嘿，嘿
What the fuck, Stewart? Uh, hey, hey, hey, hey

633
00:23:26,014 --> 00:23:27,981
卡特小姐，我們來看一下語言
Let's watch the language, please, Miss Carter

634
00:23:27,983 --> 00:23:30,451
為什麼你要把AP演算添加到我的課程負荷中，
Why did you add AP Calculus to my class load,

635
00:23:30,453 --> 00:23:32,219
知道我已經有了
knowing good and well I already have

636
00:23:32,221 --> 00:23:34,120
五個單元教加夜校？
five units to teach plus night school?

637
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:35,889
太多了等等，等等
It's too much Wait, hold on

638
00:23:35,891 --> 00:23:38,158
你是...你是夜校老師？
You're... you're the night school teacher?

639
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,160
不，我只是個喜歡穿女衫的婊子
No, I'm just a bitch that like to wear blouses

640
00:23:40,162 --> 00:23:41,861
是的，我是夜校老師
Yes, I'm the night school teacher

641
00:23:41,863 --> 00:23:43,397
小妖精，你給我帶了些干三葉草嗎？
Did you bring me some dried shamrocks, leprechaun?

642
00:23:43,399 --> 00:23:44,798
這還不好笑
It's still not funny

643
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,099
等等，等等，等等
Wait, well, hold up

644
00:23:46,101 --> 00:23:47,500
斯圖，你為什麼告訴我你
Stew, why'd you just tell me that you

645
00:23:47,502 --> 00:23:48,568
這裡沒有夜校嗎？
don't have night school here?

646
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,270
你為什麼這麼說？
Why would you say that?

647
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:53,940
我這麼說是因為泰迪和我一起上學
I said that because Teddy and I went to school together

648
00:23:53,942 --> 00:23:57,077
坦率地說，他是一個糟糕的學生，
He is, quite frankly, a terrible student,

649
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:58,945
我不希望這個元素出現在這裡
and I did not want that element in here

650
00:23:58,947 --> 00:24:00,846
我不在乎他是否像Minion一樣愚蠢
I don't care if he's as dumb as a Minion

651
00:24:00,848 --> 00:24:02,582
如果他願意，歡迎他來上我的課
He is welcome to take my class if he wants

652
00:24:02,584 --> 00:24:04,484
謝謝你。謝謝你
Thank you. Thank you for that

653
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:06,520
不客氣，因為你需要它
You're welcome Cause you-you need it

654
00:24:06,522 --> 00:24:09,055
凱莉，我們能記下真相嗎？
Carrie, can we just take down the 'tude?

655
00:24:09,057 --> 00:24:10,190
恩？真的嗎？
'Tude? Really?
不，我是
No, I'm

656
00:24:10,192 --> 00:24:12,158
你甚至沒有看到這種態度的開始
You haven't even seen the beginning of this attitude

657
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,160
哦，我——我等著，再對我說一遍
Oh, I-I Wait, say that to me again

658
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:15,195
我道歉
I apologize

659
00:24:15,197 --> 00:24:16,596
這是一個糟糕的詞語選擇
That was a poor choice of words

660
00:24:16,598 --> 00:24:19,132
我只是說我需要你向我表示敬意
I just mean I need you to show me the respect

661
00:24:19,134 --> 00:24:20,900
你會向你的老闆展示
that you would show your boss

662
00:24:20,902 --> 00:24:22,235
因為這是你的房子，對吧？
Because this is your house, right?

663
00:24:22,237 --> 00:24:23,869
哦，你...你和他一起做了黑色的聲音？
Oh, you... you did the black voice thing with him?

664
00:24:23,871 --> 00:24:25,071
這不是一個黑色的聲音
It's not a black voice

665
00:24:25,073 --> 00:24:27,039
實際上，沒有一個黑色的聲音
In actuality, not a black voice

666
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:28,475
不，你的聲音很黑
No, you do a black voice

667
00:24:28,477 --> 00:24:30,043
你不記得你在開會的時候，
You don't remember when you was in that meeting,

668
00:24:30,045 --> 00:24:31,845
你想，我們會在這裡把它點燃
you was like, We gonna get it lit up in here

669
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:32,846
會議開始了！
This meeting lit!

670
00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:33,947
天很亮
It was very lit

671
00:24:33,949 --> 00:24:35,215
你是在員工會議上做的
You did it at the staff meeting

672
00:24:35,217 --> 00:24:37,517
當你喜歡的時候，我會保留一百英鎊。
when you were like, I keep it one hundred.

673
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:39,051
我什麼時候沒把它保存一百年？
When have I never kept it one hunnid?

674
00:24:39,053 --> 00:24:42,155
當你把AP演算添加到我的類負載中時
When you added that AP Calculus to my class load

675
00:24:42,157 --> 00:24:44,557
好吧，同意不同意聽著，我討厭分手
All right, agree to disagree Listen, I hate to break up

676
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,993
這種妄想的快樂一方，
this pleasure party of delusion,

677
00:24:46,995 --> 00:24:48,361
但是我還有工作要做
but I have work to do

678
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:50,299
哇，那麼，請原諒
Wow So, if you'll excuse me

679
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,067
我- -我要盡我的努力
I'm-a do my thang

680
00:24:55,904 --> 00:24:58,371
那是...那是一個黑色的聲音
That's... that's a black voice

681
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:00,373
看看活著的人！
Look alive, people!

682
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:03,142
讓我們有目的地行動吧！走，走，走，走，走！
Let's move with purpose! Go, go, go, go, go!

683
00:25:03,144 --> 00:25:05,045
嘿。嘿，不要在我的大廳裡閒逛！
Hey. Hey No loitering in my hall!

684
00:25:05,047 --> 00:25:07,614
能...他真能做到嗎？他能阻止我去這裡嗎？
Can... can he really do that? Can he keep me from going here?

685
00:25:07,616 --> 00:25:10,883
不，他不能。事實上，這是一本教科書
No, he can't. As a matter of fact, here's a textbook

686
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:12,951
事實上，我現在就要開始上課
I'm actually going to set up the class right now

687
00:25:12,953 --> 00:25:14,887
這學期的第一節課
for our first session of the semester

688
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:16,255
我們7點開始
We start at 7:00

689
00:25:16,257 --> 00:25:18,291
是的，但是這本書有點厚
Yeah, but this-this book is just kind of thick

690
00:25:18,293 --> 00:25:21,096
我想這更像是一張傳單
I thought it would be more like a leaflet

691
00:25:24,098 --> 00:25:26,265
你以為你可以補習四年高中
You thought you could cram four years of high school

692
00:25:26,267 --> 00:25:27,366
變成傳單？
into a leaflet?

693
00:25:27,368 --> 00:25:28,534
不，也許你是
No Maybe you are

694
00:25:28,536 --> 00:25:30,904
正如斯圖爾特所說的那樣愚蠢等等，不，不，不，不，不
as dumb as Stewart says Wait, wait, no, no, no, no

695
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:32,038
不，不，我沒想到
No, no, I didn't I didn't think that

696
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,273
去圖書館，然後我就
Go to the library, then I just

697
00:25:33,275 --> 00:25:34,474
我會抓住小瘦骨嶙峋的侏儒！
I'll hold on Little scrawny midget!

698
00:25:34,476 --> 00:25:36,141
我會堅持下去
I'll hold on to it

699
00:25:36,143 --> 00:25:37,910
嗯，嗯，我被絆倒了
Mm-hmm I'm trippin

700
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:40,012
我在沿著交通學校的路線思考
I'm thinking along the lines of traffic school

701
00:25:40,014 --> 00:25:42,048
聽著，來不來對我沒什麼影響
Look, come or not makes me no difference

702
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:44,016
我不按人頭付費
I don't get paid by the head

703
00:25:44,018 --> 00:25:45,951
或者你可以找到夜校
Or maybe you can find a night school

704
00:25:45,953 --> 00:25:47,587
這確實是傳單上的內容
that does teach from a leaflet

705
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:49,254
你知道一件事...？
You-you know of one that...?

706
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,624
不，不，不，不，我會保留它
No, no, no I'm-I'm gonna keep it

707
00:25:52,193 --> 00:25:53,460
有一個好的
Have a good one

708
00:25:53,462 --> 00:25:56,496
marv，我不知道這件GED的事
Marv, I do not know about this GED thing

709
00:25:56,498 --> 00:25:58,465
我沒有，夥計。老師很嚴厲
I don't, man The teacher is tough as hell

710
00:25:58,467 --> 00:26:00,232
抓住馬伕，讓我回擊你
Hold on Marv, let me hit you back

711
00:26:00,234 --> 00:26:01,233
喲！
Yo!

712
00:26:01,235 --> 00:26:02,501
哦，媽的！
Oh, shit!

713
00:26:02,503 --> 00:26:04,403
撐住！停下，停下！
Hold up! Stop, stop!

714
00:26:04,405 --> 00:26:06,473
你在做什麼？我在做什麼？
What you doing? What's it look like I'm doing?

715
00:26:06,475 --> 00:26:08,508
呃，看起來你拖著我的車
Uh, it look like you towing my car

716
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,075
我把車停在殘疾人區了嗎？
Did I park in a handicap spot?

717
00:26:10,077 --> 00:26:11,644
你錯過了那輛車的最後四筆付款
You've missed the last four payments on that car

718
00:26:11,646 --> 00:26:12,712
它被收回了
It's getting repossessed

719
00:26:12,714 --> 00:26:14,680
你要帶著我的孩子坐我的車嗎？
You gonna take my car with my baby in the back?

720
00:26:14,682 --> 00:26:16,982
沒看到裡面有該死的嬰兒
Don't see no goddamn baby in there

721
00:26:16,984 --> 00:26:20,152
嬰兒就在那裡
The baby right there

722
00:26:20,154 --> 00:26:22,454
你沒聽到嗎？我不這麼認為
You don't hear that? I don't think so

723
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:24,425
嘿，夥計，我說過不要這麼做
Hey, man, I said don't do it

724
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:26,959
我不玩了
I'm not playing

725
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:28,060
讓開，夥計
Get out of the way, dude

726
00:26:28,062 --> 00:26:29,562
停下，夥計
Stop, man

727
00:26:29,564 --> 00:26:30,697
我的孩子在這裡！
I got my baby in here!

728
00:26:30,699 --> 00:26:32,465
車要開了
The car is leaving

729
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:34,099
讓開，夥計，我帶你離開
Get out of the way, dude I'll show you leaving

730
00:26:34,101 --> 00:26:35,567
來吧，夥計，我有東西給你
Come on, man I've got something for your ass

731
00:26:35,569 --> 00:26:37,436
下車
Get out of the car

732
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:43,976
你想玩那個遊戲嗎？是啊！
You want to play that game? Yeah!

733
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:46,113
你想看什麼嗎？那麼，來吧！
You want to see something? Come on, then!

734
00:26:49,283 --> 00:26:50,416
再見
Bye

735
00:26:50,418 --> 00:26:51,450
笨蛋
Dumb-ass

736
00:26:51,452 --> 00:26:52,719
哦，上帝！
Oh, God!

737
00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:56,488
很高興你們都喜歡這個節目
Glad y'all enjoyed the show

738
00:26:58,192 --> 00:27:01,160
告訴我未婚妻我又出車禍了！
Tell my fiancee I got in another accident!

739
00:27:07,401 --> 00:27:09,268
呃
Uh

740
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,637
凱莉，對吧？哦
Carrie, right? Oh

741
00:27:11,639 --> 00:27:13,305
所以，儘管我們有教科書大小的教科書，
So, even though we got textbook-sized textbooks,

742
00:27:13,307 --> 00:27:14,506
你決定加入我們
you decided to join us

743
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:17,042
好吧，坐吧
Well, grab a seat

744
00:27:17,044 --> 00:27:18,545
我們幾分鐘後開始
We'll get started in a few

745
00:27:18,547 --> 00:27:21,180
呃，好吧，在我現在這麼做之前，我知道我們下車了
Uh, okay, before I do that now, I know we got off

746
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:23,182
走錯了路，所以我在想
on the wrong foot, so I was thinking

747
00:27:23,184 --> 00:27:25,451
我不知道...我不知道你有沒有時間吃飯，
I don't know... I don't know if you had time for dinner or not,

748
00:27:25,453 --> 00:27:27,453
所以我自己承擔了
so I took it upon myself

749
00:27:27,455 --> 00:27:30,189
去給你買一個我個人最喜歡的
to go and get you one of my personal favorites

750
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:31,791
這是A區最好的墨西哥人
It's the best Mexican here in the A

751
00:27:31,793 --> 00:27:33,392
哦。謝謝你
Oh. Thank you

752
00:27:33,394 --> 00:27:35,327
你想得真周到，泰迪
That is so thoughtful of you, Teddy

753
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:37,663
看看這個
So, check this out

754
00:27:37,665 --> 00:27:39,398
我翻看了你高中時的一些舊記錄
I went through some of your old high school records

755
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,033
嗯嗯數學，
Uh-huh Math,

756
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:44,636
科學，英語，你是個糟糕的學生
science, English you was a horrible student

757
00:27:44,638 --> 00:27:46,271
那你怎麼了？
What was going on with you then?

758
00:27:46,273 --> 00:27:47,539
你被虐待了嗎？
Was you being abused or something?

759
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,140
凱莉，我的事
Carrie, the thing with me

760
00:27:49,142 --> 00:27:51,443
我更喜歡用這個世界作為我的教室
is I prefer to use the world as my classroom

761
00:27:51,445 --> 00:27:54,646
老實說，我不是
And to be honest with you, I'm not a

762
00:27:54,648 --> 00:27:57,182
我不像其他人
I'm not like the rest of these folks

763
00:27:57,184 --> 00:28:00,219
我不是你所說的夜校學生
I'm just not what you would call a night school person

764
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:03,354
所以我想，也許你和我可以互相照顧
So I figure, maybe you and I can look out for one another

765
00:28:03,356 --> 00:28:05,190
你幫我，我幫你
You help me, I help you

766
00:28:05,192 --> 00:28:06,725
你支持我，我支持你
You got my back, I got your back

767
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:08,727
不管怎樣，但這只是一次談話
Whatever, but it's just a conversation

768
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,829
享受你的玉米餅吧
So enjoy your tacos

769
00:28:10,831 --> 00:28:13,434
那微笑能照亮一個房間，不是嗎？
That smile can light up a room, can't it?

770
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:19,607
我不去那裡
I ain't going there

771
00:28:36,457 --> 00:28:39,158
記得我嗎，彭德喬？
Remember me, pendejo?

772
00:28:44,498 --> 00:28:47,098
如果不是Pubey McGee
Well, if it isn't Pubey McGee

773
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,601
奶酪蛋糕酒吧在這裡，嗯？
The cheesecake puber is here, huh?

774
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:51,202
見到我很驚訝，兄弟？
Surprised to see me, bro?

775
00:28:51,204 --> 00:28:53,238
考慮到你解雇了我，你不應該這麼做
You shouldn't be, considering that you got me fired

776
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,174
我沒有讓你被解雇是的，你被解雇了
I did not get you fired Yes, you did

777
00:28:56,176 --> 00:28:57,409
我在客服部門工作
I worked in customer service

778
00:28:57,411 --> 00:28:58,844
很久以來，每個人都知道這一點
for a long time Everybody knows that

779
00:28:58,846 --> 00:29:00,879
顧客總是對的
the customer is always right

780
00:29:00,881 --> 00:29:03,648
小費是我的生計，我有20英鎊給你
Tips are my livelihood I had a 20 coming your way

781
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,350
賬單是800美元
The bill was $800

782
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:07,819
我有一筆60美元的錢，夥計
I had a buck sixty coming to me, man

783
00:29:07,821 --> 00:29:09,688
好吧。那是你的錯好吧，我們開始吧
Okay. That's your fault Okay, let's begin

784
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,723
這裡誰喜歡墨西哥玉米卷？
Who here likes tacos?

785
00:29:11,725 --> 00:29:13,892
哦！哦，哦，哦！
Oh! Oh, oh Ooh!

786
00:29:13,894 --> 00:29:16,294
他們吃素？
They vegetarian?

787
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,530
因為除非是烤肉，否則我不吃肉
Cause I don't eat meat unless it's barbecue

788
00:29:18,532 --> 00:29:20,197
讓我們看看泰迪給我們帶來了什麼
Let's see what Teddy brought us

789
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:22,400
呃，我們有卡爾·阿薩達
Uh, we got carne asada

790
00:29:22,402 --> 00:29:23,635
這邊請
There you go

791
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,169
有，呃，艾爾牧師
There's, uh, al pastor

792
00:29:25,171 --> 00:29:26,504
哦，謝謝你...你喜歡嗎？嗯
Oh, thanks You... you like that? Um

793
00:29:26,506 --> 00:29:27,705
卡妮塔？你喜歡carnitas嗎？
Carnitas? You like carnitas?

794
00:29:27,707 --> 00:29:29,141
給你，女孩哦！
There you go, girl Ooh!

795
00:29:29,143 --> 00:29:30,742
呃...呃，對不起，嘿！
Uh... uh, excuse me Hey!

796
00:29:30,744 --> 00:29:33,779
凱莉，我真的有那些墨西哥玉米卷給你吃
Carrie, I-I had actually got those tacos for you to eat

797
00:29:33,781 --> 00:29:35,179
我知道
I know

798
00:29:35,181 --> 00:29:37,348
看，同學們，泰迪去了
See, class, Teddy went to

799
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:40,184
仙人掌屋試圖說服我
Cactus House to try to win me over

800
00:29:40,186 --> 00:29:41,453
但這是交易，泰迪
But here's the deal, Teddy

801
00:29:41,455 --> 00:29:43,321
如果你想親我的屁股，
If you're trying to kiss my ass,

802
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,323
你得比那好一點
you're gonna have to come a little bit better than that

803
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,925
我說的是蒸龍蝦
I'm talking, like, steamed lobster

804
00:29:46,927 --> 00:29:48,894
在通心粉和奶酪裡，
inside a macaroni and cheese,

805
00:29:48,896 --> 00:29:50,595
帶著布羅克裡尼的一面
with a side of broccolini

806
00:29:50,597 --> 00:29:52,664
你知道我在說什麼嗎？一些奇特的東西
You know what I'm saying? Something fancy

807
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,666
不是沒有我可以去的快餐店
Not no fast food place where I could

808
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:56,802
用我自己的零亂的薪水去買這個
go buy this with my own little raggedy paycheck

809
00:29:56,804 --> 00:29:58,737
嗯，實際上有一個
Well, there's actually a

810
00:29:58,739 --> 00:30:00,771
實際上有一種特殊的鱷梨色拉醬
there's actually a special guacamole

811
00:30:00,773 --> 00:30:04,543
如果你想在我的班上取得成功，
If you want to succeed in my class,

812
00:30:04,545 --> 00:30:05,811
你需要做這項工作
you need to do the work

813
00:30:05,813 --> 00:30:07,178
就這麼簡單
It's just that simple

814
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,512
是嗎？呃，快速提問
Yes? Uh, quick question

815
00:30:08,514 --> 00:30:11,349
嗯，那麼蒸龍蝦怎麼樣？
Uh, so yes on the steamed lobster?

816
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,317
不，先生

白天，我教書

823
00:30:25,632 --> 00:30:27,632
課程太多，錢太少
way too many classes for way too little money

824
00:30:27,634 --> 00:30:30,468
所以我來這裡是想多賺點錢
So I'm here to try to make a little extra cash

825
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:34,872
所以我能負擔得起房租和抗生素等奢侈品
so I can afford such luxuries as rent and antibiotics

826
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:38,242

if you want options, you gonna have to get your GED

839
00:31:02,969 --> 00:31:04,803
要麼就是這樣，要麼就是打掃房間
It's either that or end up cleaning rooms

840
00:31:04,805 --> 00:31:07,605
在貝斯特韋斯特酒店，工資減半。
at the Best Western for half your salary.

841
00:31:07,607 --> 00:31:09,640
如果你認識傑伊，那是行不通的
And if you know Jay, that ain't gonna work

842
00:31:09,642 --> 00:31:12,643
嘿，讓我這麼說吧，
Hey, let me let me just say this,

843
00:31:12,645 --> 00:31:14,979
好吧，當我登上講台的時候
okay, while I got the platform

844
00:31:14,981 --> 00:31:18,616
對我來說，我第一次醒來時看到終結者，
For me, I first got woke when I seen Terminator,

845
00:31:18,618 --> 00:31:22,386
我意識到這不僅僅是一部電影；
and I realized it wasn't just a movie;

846
00:31:22,388 --> 00:31:23,788
這是預言
it was prophecy

847
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:26,524
首先由3.5 %的人識別，
First identified by the 3.5-Percenters,

848
00:31:26,526 --> 00:31:27,792
但那是另一次對話
but that's another conversation

849
00:31:27,794 --> 00:31:29,627
我們就這樣說吧

這只是時間到了的信號

讓我做一些不同的事情

所以我想我會是個天生的

00:35:11,016 --> 00:35:12,849
他在這裡，但他不在
He here, but he not

954
00:35:12,851 --> 00:35:14,217
那是圖帕克·科切拉
That's Tupac Coachella

955
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:15,251
你知道我在說什麼嗎？
You know what I'm saying?

956
00:35:15,253 --> 00:35:17,121
他在...你看到了嗎？
And he in the... You see?

957
00:35:17,123 --> 00:35:19,223
你們都不知道...？好吧，嗯
Y'all don't...? All right, um

958
00:35:19,225 --> 00:35:21,591
那可能不是真正的黑鬼。嘿
That probably ain't even a real nigga. Hey

959
00:35:21,593 --> 00:35:23,793
你瘋了嗎？這是- -這是Skype
Are you on crack? It's-it's Skype

960
00:35:23,795 --> 00:35:26,595
唷，孩子，很難被吵醒
Whew, boy, it's hard to be woke

961
00:35:27,731 --> 00:35:29,168
很難被吵醒
It's hard to be woke

962
00:35:30,502 --> 00:35:32,769
什麼醒了？
What is woke?

963
00:35:32,771 --> 00:35:35,672
好吧，歡迎大家
Okay, well, welcome, everyone

964
00:35:35,674 --> 00:35:36,773
真的很好。我們都見過面
Really nice. We've all met

965
00:35:36,775 --> 00:35:38,207
嗯，我們沒有，呃
Well, we didn't, uh

966
00:35:38,209 --> 00:35:40,109
我們沒有遇見我們沒有遇見每個人
we didn't meet we didn't meet everyone

967
00:35:40,111 --> 00:35:42,211
我沒有，呃泰迪，呃，早些時候，
I didn't, uh Teddy, uh, earlier,

968
00:35:42,213 --> 00:35:44,047
你說過，不像這些人，
you said, unlike these folks,

969
00:35:44,049 --> 00:35:46,548
你不是夜校類型的人，
you're not a night school type of person,

970
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:49,551
所以我認為你不在乎
so I didn't think you cared

971
00:35:49,553 --> 00:35:51,187
對嗎？
Is that right?

972
00:35:51,189 --> 00:35:53,122
你沒有
Well, you didn't

973
00:35:53,124 --> 00:35:55,291
你沒聽清楚，因為我絕不會這麼說
you didn't hear it right, cause I would never say that

974
00:35:55,293 --> 00:35:57,260
關於我不認識的人
about people that I don't know

975
00:35:57,262 --> 00:35:59,162
你知道嗎？這是一個完美的分段
You know what? This is a perfect segue

976
00:35:59,164 --> 00:36:01,530
我會跟著你，我會站起來
I'll just follow your lead, and I'll stand up

977
00:36:01,532 --> 00:36:03,031
我是泰迪·沃克
I am Teddy Walker

978
00:36:03,033 --> 00:36:06,002
嗯，關於我的一個有趣的事實:我真的去了這裡
Uh, a little fun fact about me: I actually went here

979
00:36:06,004 --> 00:36:08,738
哦，我也剛訂婚
Oh I'm also newly engaged

980
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,605
他的未婚妻退出了他的聯盟
His fiancee is out of his league

981
00:36:10,607 --> 00:36:11,740
對不起，什麼？
I'm sorry, what?

982
00:36:11,742 --> 00:36:12,841
沒什麼。你做得很好
Nothing. You're doing great

983
00:36:12,843 --> 00:36:14,110
我說，繼續
I said, Keep going

984
00:36:14,112 --> 00:36:15,811
每個人都愛你。
Everybody loves you.

985
00:36:15,813 --> 00:36:17,613
你未婚妻感覺怎麼樣
How does your fiancee feel about

986
00:36:17,615 --> 00:36:18,614
你在夜校嗎？
you being in night school?

987
00:36:18,616 --> 00:36:19,782
哦，她很好
Oh, she good

988
00:36:19,784 --> 00:36:21,918
她喜歡
She loves it

989
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,919
他沒告訴她什麼
He ain't told her shit

990
00:36:23,921 --> 00:36:25,121
她喜歡
She loves it

991
00:36:25,123 --> 00:36:26,655
我注意到你的聲音
I noticed that your voice

992
00:36:26,657 --> 00:36:28,156
就提高了整整一個八度
just went up a whole octave

993
00:36:28,158 --> 00:36:31,626
現在，從我在研究生院的心理學研究來看，
Now, from my studies of psychology in grad school,

994
00:36:31,628 --> 00:36:34,563
我知道那意味著你在胡說八道
I know that that means that you're bullshitting

995
00:36:34,565 --> 00:36:35,931
我沒有胡說八道
Ain't no bullshit in me

996
00:36:35,933 --> 00:36:37,899
我告訴你如果你和她撒謊，
I tell you what if you're lying with her,

997
00:36:37,901 --> 00:36:40,068
不要騙她，但我不騙她...我不說謊
don't lie to her But I don't... I don't lie

998
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,738
聽起來像是胡說八道
Sound like some bullshit to me

999
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,006
每個人都看穿了你
Everyone sees right through you

1000
00:36:43,008 --> 00:36:44,573
好吧，我們怎麼樣...？嗯
Okay, how about we...? Mm-hmm

1001
00:36:44,575 --> 00:36:46,641
如果我們遵循你關於聲音的理論
If we go by your theory about the voice thing

1002
00:36:46,643 --> 00:36:47,976
我認為我們是我認為我們都是
I think that we're I think that we're all

1003
00:36:47,978 --> 00:36:49,278
偏離軌道
getting off track

1004
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,079
這小子肯定在撒謊
This boy definitely lying

1005
00:36:51,081 --> 00:36:53,116
我不是你不能勝過大自然母親
I am not You can't outsmart Mother Nature

1006
00:36:53,118 --> 00:36:54,350
這就是女人
And that's what that-that's what a woman is

1007
00:36:54,352 --> 00:36:56,685
哥哥，尤其是黑人婦女
Brother Especially a black woman

1008
00:36:56,687 --> 00:36:57,987
你知道，這是多麼正確
You know, how That's correct

1009
00:36:57,989 --> 00:36:59,921
女孩很聰明，夥計，該死的
Girls are smart, dude Goddamn it

1010
00:36:59,923 --> 00:37:00,756
就像，真的，該死的
Like, literally, damn it

1011
00:37:00,758 --> 00:37:02,624
即使他沒有告訴她，那又怎樣？
Even if he didn't tell her, so what?

1012
00:37:02,626 --> 00:37:03,692
好吧，這是我告訴Randy的事情
Okay, here's the thing I told Randy

1013
00:37:03,694 --> 00:37:05,762
他是第一個和我上床的人...不是真的
that he was the first guy I slept with... not true

1014
00:37:05,764 --> 00:37:07,330
嘿，我想自我介紹，但我不能
Hey, I'm trying to introduce myself, and I can't

1015
00:37:07,332 --> 00:37:09,198
你不尊重你的女王，因為如果你尊重了，
You don't respect your queen, cause if you did,

1016
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,866
那個婊子會知道你在哪裡好嗎
that bitch would know where you at Okay

1017
00:37:10,868 --> 00:37:12,268
泰迪
Teddy

1018
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,235
不要對你的女王撒謊
Don't lie to your queen

1019
00:37:13,237 --> 00:37:14,369
好吧，夥計們，如果你們要逃跑
Okay, guys If you're busting off

1020
00:37:14,371 --> 00:37:17,140
在她那樣的內臟裡，她可能帶著你的種子
in her guts like that, she might be carrying your seed

1021
00:37:17,142 --> 00:37:18,274
我喜歡這個對話
I feel like this conversation

1022
00:37:18,276 --> 00:37:19,841
所以你不只是在騙她；你對你的孩子撒謊
So you ain't just lying to her; you lying to your child

1023
00:37:19,843 --> 00:37:21,044
媽的！如果是你的屁股婊子，
Shit! If it's your bottom bitch,

1024
00:37:21,046 --> 00:37:22,044
她知道你很蠢，媽媽
she know you stupid, fam

1025
00:37:22,046 --> 00:37:24,046
我說的一切，fam，看-看，算了吧
All I'm saying, fam, look-look Forget it

1026
00:37:24,048 --> 00:37:26,114
好吧，你未婚妻怎麼不知道你在哪裡？
Okay How your fiancee don't know where you at?

1027
00:37:26,116 --> 00:37:27,682
天黑了
It's after dark

1028
00:37:27,684 --> 00:37:28,851
這不是萬聖節，媽媽
This ain't Halloween, fam

1029
00:37:28,853 --> 00:37:29,986
我完了
I'm done

1030
00:37:29,988 --> 00:37:32,221
我姐姐知道我在哪裡，好嗎？
My sister know where I'm at, okay?

1031
00:37:32,223 --> 00:37:34,623
她一直住在阿肯色州
And she live all the way in Arkansas

1032
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:36,825
好吧。這是交易，同學們
Okay. Here's the deal, class

1033
00:37:36,827 --> 00:37:39,728
你每天晚上都會有家庭作業
You will be given homework every night

1034
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,197
就像普通高中一樣
just like regular high school

1035
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:42,764
那麼
And now

1036
00:37:42,766 --> 00:37:44,267
突擊測驗
a pop quiz

1037
00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:47,936
這樣我就能更好地瞭解你們都在哪裡
just so I can get a better idea of where you all are

1038
00:37:47,938 --> 00:37:50,005
等等。第一天我們有考試？
Wait, wait. We got a we got a test on the first day?

1039
00:37:50,007 --> 00:37:53,109
泰迪，這是一個突擊測驗，好嗎？
Teddy, it's a pop quiz, okay?

1040
00:37:53,111 --> 00:37:54,410
看這裡，夥計們
Look here, folks

1041
00:37:54,412 --> 00:37:57,879
如果你來這裡學習，我是來教書的
I am here to teach if you're here to learn

1042
00:37:57,881 --> 00:38:01,416
否則，你現在就可以離開我的班級
Otherwise, you can get out of my class right now

1043
00:38:01,418 --> 00:38:03,285
這是怎麼回事
That's what's up

1044
00:38:03,287 --> 00:38:05,589
歡迎來到夜校
Welcome to night school

1045
00:38:08,259 --> 00:38:10,659
這邊請
There you go

00:38:10,661 --> 00:38:12,427
太可怕了，夥計，太可怕了！
It was terrible, man Terrible!

1047
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:13,929
她不像老師
Like, she's not like the teachers

1048
00:38:13,931 --> 00:38:15,330
我們在那一天
that we had back in the day

1049
00:38:15,332 --> 00:38:17,400
什麼？這個女人是一堵磚牆，
What? This woman is a brick wall,

1050
00:38:17,402 --> 00:38:18,967
我不能，我不能和她一起工作

1051
00:38:18,969 --> 00:38:21,236
我不能做磚牆
I can't work a brick wall

1052
00:38:21,238 --> 00:38:22,204
你在做什麼？
What are you what are you doing?

1053
00:38:22,206 --> 00:38:24,272
我正在努力減肥
I'm working out I'm trying to shed some LBs

1054
00:38:24,274 --> 00:38:26,674
我想感覺健康，為什麼我還要問？
I want to feel fit Uh, why am I even asking?

1055
00:38:26,676 --> 00:38:28,977
同時，請停止支付一切費用，
In the meantime, please stop paying for everything,

1056
00:38:28,979 --> 00:38:31,447
你必須找份臨時工作
and you have to get a temp job

1057
00:38:31,449 --> 00:38:33,849
你不認為我一直在找工作嗎？
You don't think I've been looking for a job?

1058
00:38:33,851 --> 00:38:36,184
你瘋了嗎？我在跑步機上
What are you, crazy? I'm on a treadmill

1059
00:38:36,186 --> 00:38:38,286
我想要的工作，不是

1060
00:38:38,288 --> 00:38:40,755
會給一個高中輟學生

1061
00:38:40,757 --> 00:38:42,358
你不能一直對麗莎撒謊
Well, you can't keep lying to Lisa

1062
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,559
好嗎？你知道嗎，我要走了

現在，談到頭銜，我甚至不在乎
Now, when it comes to titles, I don't even care

1087
00:39:46,789 --> 00:39:48,390
營銷總監由你決定
Marketing director that's up to you

1088
00:39:48,392 --> 00:39:51,091
WWJD，在這一點上，耶穌會怎麼做？
WWJD, at this point What would Jesus do?

1089
00:39:51,093 --> 00:39:52,394
是的，先生，我問的一件事
Yes, sir The one thing that I ask

1090
00:39:52,396 --> 00:39:53,929
對你來說，時間是靈活的，
is for you to be flexible with the hours,

1091
00:39:53,931 --> 00:39:55,363
因為我要拿到我的GED
cause I'm getting my GED

1092
00:39:55,365 --> 00:39:57,165
泰迪哥哥，你正在進步
You are bettering yourself, Brother Teddy

1093
00:39:57,167 --> 00:39:59,334
是的，這就是做一名基督徒的意義所在
Yeah That's what being a Christian is all about

1094
00:39:59,336 --> 00:40:01,135
是的，修正了這一點
Yeah, amen to that

1095
00:40:01,137 --> 00:40:02,136
阿門
Amen

1096
00:40:02,138 --> 00:40:03,706
是啊，光榮是
Yeah Glory be

1097
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:06,243
這應該非常適合你
This should fit you perfectly

1098
00:40:07,544 --> 00:40:08,543
泰迪哥哥，
Brother Teddy,

1099
00:40:08,545 --> 00:40:10,445
我一直在等待上帝
I have been waiting on the Lord

1100
00:40:10,447 --> 00:40:12,347
給我帶來一個像你這樣的小個子男人
to bring me a pint-sized little man like you

1101
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:15,818
填完這個，給你
to fill this out, and here you are

1102
00:40:17,187 --> 00:40:19,020
我不會這麼做的
I'm-I'm not gonna do that

1103
00:40:19,022 --> 00:40:22,089
艾薩克兄弟，我——我是個黑人
Brother Isaac, I-I'm a black man

1104
00:40:22,091 --> 00:40:25,392
2018年我不能穿上雞服
I can't put on a chicken suit in 2018

1105
00:40:25,394 --> 00:40:27,928
站在公路邊上
and stand on the side of a highway

1106
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:30,098
不賣該死的雞
and hawk no goddamn chicken

1107
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,566
現在，如果營銷職位不是你想要的
Now, if the marketing position isn't what you

1108
00:40:31,568 --> 00:40:32,933
我們可以想像
had in mind, we can figure

1109
00:40:32,935 --> 00:40:34,068
這是怎麼回事？
What is going on?

1110
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:36,203
你知道嗎？我們得在裡面插個別針
You know what? We're gonna have to put a pin in that

1111
00:40:36,205 --> 00:40:37,938
那是消防演習嗎？好了，各位
Is that a fire drill? All right, everybody

1112
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,473
讓我們聚在一起，時間到了
Let's gather round The hour is upon us

1113
00:40:39,475 --> 00:40:40,976
最近的出口在哪？
Where's the closest exit?

1114
00:40:40,978 --> 00:40:43,044
是時候祈禱了是時候做什麼了？
It is time to pray It's time to what?

1115
00:40:43,046 --> 00:40:45,045
是時候祈禱了

1116
00:40:45,047 --> 00:40:46,914
該死的。你的交易是什麼？

1117
00:40:46,916 --> 00:40:49,216
什麼...？嘿，親愛的主夫人:我們感謝你
What's...? Hey, lady Dear Lord: We thank you

1118
00:40:49,218 --> 00:40:50,484
把小泰迪帶給我們
for bringing little Teddy to us

1119
00:40:50,486 --> 00:40:51,819
今天早上在這裡是的，先生

1120
00:40:51,821 --> 00:40:53,021
這個小山雀

1121
00:40:53,023 --> 00:40:54,222
嗯？
Huh?

1122
00:40:54,224 --> 00:40:55,956
與世界分享你珍貴的家禽
about your precious poultry with the world

1123
00:40:55,958 --> 00:40:57,891
我不會做的是在裡面做
What I'm not gonna do is do it in

1124
00:40:57,893 --> 00:40:59,260
夫人，夫人
Ma'am, ma'am

對不起！
Excuse me!

What I'm not gonna do is do it in the chick... Goddamn

1128
00:41:06,002 --> 00:41:07,101
泰迪哥哥
Brother Teddy

1129
00:41:07,103 --> 00:41:08,370
他在你身上
He's in you

1130
00:41:08,372 --> 00:41:09,471
他在你心裡，不是嗎？
He's in you, ain't he?

1131
00:41:09,473 --> 00:41:10,871
雞肉套裝與否，
Chicken suit or not,

1132
00:41:10,873 --> 00:41:12,506
我們現在都在一起祈禱

1133
00:41:12,508 --> 00:41:14,842
你今天會在這裡找到你的窩

00:41:14,844 --> 00:41:16,910

1137
00:41:20,116 --> 00:41:21,148
歡迎，泰迪兄弟
Welcome, Brother Teddy

1138
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:23,183
好了，各位，這是一個重要的日子
All right, everybody, this is a big day

1139
00:41:23,185 --> 00:41:25,152
嘿，兄弟，讓我很快地對你大喊大叫
Hey, brother, let me holler at you real quick

1140
00:41:25,154 --> 00:41:26,453
你們都在沉沒的地方嗎？
Are y'all in the Sunken Place?

1141
00:41:26,455 --> 00:41:28,189
讓我們通過食物分享耶穌。我們走吧
Let's share Jesus through our food. Let's go

1142
00:41:28,191 --> 00:41:29,591
午餐高峰來了
The lunch rush is upon us

1143
00:41:29,593 --> 00:41:30,991
什麼...午餐高峰？
What... lunch rush?

1144
00:41:30,993 --> 00:41:32,092
現在是上午10點
It's 10:00 a.m

1145
00:41:32,094 --> 00:41:33,460
我不明白
I don't understand

1146
00:41:33,462 --> 00:41:34,962
這怎麼會被認為是午餐高峰
how that could be considered a lunch rush

1147
00:41:34,964 --> 00:41:36,597
相信我，泰迪哥哥
Trust me, Brother Teddy

1148
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:39,333
好吧，如果有...如果- -如果有什麼辦法我可以直接說
Okay, if there... if-if there's any way that I can just talk

1149
00:41:39,335 --> 00:41:41,336
女士們，早上好

1158
00:42:02,558 --> 00:42:04,592
現在，從你第一個晚上的家庭作業開始，
Now, from your first night of homework,

1159
00:42:04,594 --> 00:42:09,063
你們都應該非常熟悉畢達哥拉斯定理
you all should be very familiar with the Pythagorean theorem

1160
00:42:09,065 --> 00:42:10,297
好嗎？跟我說
All right? Say it with me

1161
00:42:10,299 --> 00:42:11,532
畢達哥拉斯學派...

1162
00:42:11,534 --> 00:42:12,566
畢達哥拉斯學派。

00:42:12,568 --> 00:42:13,567
Pathegorinean。
Pathygorinean.

1164
00:42:13,569 --> 00:42:14,967
定理。定理。

1165
00:42:14,969 --> 00:42:16,103
定理。你就是這麼說的
Theorem. That's how you say it

1166
00:42:16,105 --> 00:42:17,505
就是這樣
That's what it is

1167
00:42:17,507 --> 00:42:19,973
嘿，喲，鮑比，小心，媽媽！
Hey, yo, Bobby, watch out, fam!

1168
00:42:19,975 --> 00:42:22,009
我的天啊！
My God Oh!

1169
00:42:22,011 --> 00:42:23,243
什麼？！呵
What?! Ooh

1170
00:42:23,245 --> 00:42:25,145
哦！
Oh!

1171
00:42:25,147 --> 00:42:27,981
欺騙
Shit

1172
00:42:27,983 --> 00:42:30,084
你沒看到我在努力學習嗎？
Can't you see I'm trying to learn?

1173
00:42:30,086 --> 00:42:31,653
應該有人報警
Someone ought to call the cops

1174
00:42:31,655 --> 00:42:33,987
發生什麼事了？拿著！
What's happening? Take that!

1175
00:42:35,491 --> 00:42:37,224
哦！耶穌
Ooh! Jesus

1176
00:42:37,226 --> 00:42:38,925
放開我！放開我！
Get off me! Get off me!

1177
00:42:38,927 --> 00:42:40,361
他起床了，他起床了，他起床了
He's getting up, he's getting up, he's getting up

1178
00:42:40,363 --> 00:42:41,563
小心，媽媽！在你身後，黑鬼！
Watch out, fam! Behind you, nigga!

1179
00:42:41,565 --> 00:42:43,430
哦，我的天啊！
Oh, my God Oh!

1180
00:42:43,432 --> 00:42:44,998
哦，他剛剛踢了他一腳
Oh, he just kicked him in the

1181
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,266
哦，我的上帝！哦！

1182
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:50,571
哦！夠了！是啊！是啊！
Oh! Enough! Yeah! Yeah!

1183
00:42:50,573 --> 00:42:52,039
幹掉他！踩他的頭！
Finish him! Step on his head!

1184
00:42:53,209 --> 00:42:54,641
過來。打破它來吧！
Come here. Break it up Come on!

1185
00:42:54,643 --> 00:42:56,643
起來！

嘿，來吧！哦，嘿，夥計！
Hey, come on! Oh, hey, man!

1187
00:42:58,414 --> 00:42:59,513
我什麼都沒做
I didn't do shit

1188
00:42:59,515 --> 00:43:01,615
就在那裡
That's the stuff right there

1189
00:43:01,617 --> 00:43:03,383
讓我想起了過去
Reminds me of the old days

1190
00:43:06,088 --> 00:43:08,455
他們找錯人了
They had the wrong guy

1191
00:43:08,457 --> 00:43:10,224
請繼續你確定你很酷，
Please continue You sure you cool,

1192
00:43:10,226 --> 00:43:11,658
還是我們需要冷靜下來
or do we need to just chill

1193
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,627
等著你做一個新的刀柄？
and wait for you to make a new shank?

1194
00:43:13,629 --> 00:43:17,030
請繼續畢達哥拉斯學派
Please continue with the Pythagorean

1195
00:43:17,032 --> 00:43:18,599
理論。
theory-em.

1196
00:43:18,601 --> 00:43:21,068
好吧
O-Okay

1197
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:22,736
你知道我們應該為鮑比做什麼嗎？
You know what we ought to do for Bobby?

1198
00:43:22,738 --> 00:43:25,204
我們應該給他弄些煙，
We should get him, like, some smokes,

1199
00:43:25,206 --> 00:43:26,740
因為這些東西就像監獄裡的貨幣
cause that stuff is like currency in prison

1200
00:43:26,742 --> 00:43:28,108
那個和屁股
That and ass

1201
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:29,443
好了，我們開始吧
Okay, here we go

1202
00:43:29,445 --> 00:43:32,045
這就是我們所說的直角三角形
So, this is what we call a right triangle

1203
00:43:32,047 --> 00:43:35,549
我們已經知道了三角形兩邊的值
And we already know the value of two sides of the triangle

1204
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:38,151
哦，這對我們來說應該很容易
Oh That should make it very easy for us

1205
00:43:38,153 --> 00:43:40,554
計算斜邊
to calculate the hypotenuse Mmm, mmm

1206
00:43:40,556 --> 00:43:44,725
A平方加B平方等於C平方
A-squared plus B-squared equals C-squared

1207
00:43:44,727 --> 00:43:46,092
跟我說，夥計們
Say that with me, guys

1208
00:43:46,094 --> 00:43:48,762
A平方加B平方
A-squared plus B-squared

1209
00:43:48,764 --> 00:43:51,264
等於C平方
equals C-squared

1210
00:43:51,266 --> 00:43:53,267
非常好。泰迪？
Very good. Uh, Teddy?

1211
00:43:53,269 --> 00:43:54,735
你似乎從中得到了真正的樂趣
You seem to be getting a real kick out of this

1212
00:43:54,737 --> 00:43:56,770
她抓住你了，泰迪！
She got you, Teddy!

1213
00:43:56,772 --> 00:43:59,105
你想上來解決這個問題嗎？
You want to come up and solve the problem?

1214
00:43:59,107 --> 00:44:00,542
被逮捕了！
Busted!

1215
00:44:03,178 --> 00:44:05,112
如果，呃，那就是你
If, uh, that's what you

1216
00:44:05,114 --> 00:44:07,381
如果那是你想要我做的
if that's what you want me to do

1217
00:44:07,383 --> 00:44:08,315
上來
Come on up

1218
00:44:08,317 --> 00:44:09,716
來吧，泰迪，這個給你
Come on, Teddy You got this

00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:12,351
你拿到了，泰迪·泰迪！

00:44:14,189 --> 00:44:16,690
泰迪！泰德，泰迪，泰迪！
Teddy! Ted, Teddy, Teddy!

1222
00:44:24,032 --> 00:44:26,167
找到C的值
Find the value of C

1223
00:44:39,347 --> 00:44:40,616
你知道嗎？
You know what?

1224
00:44:43,419 --> 00:44:45,552
我想這裡面有些東西
I think there's something in here

1225
00:44:48,456 --> 00:44:51,426
喲，喲，喲！怎麼了，我的夜校？
Yo, yo, yo! What up, my night school?

1226
00:44:52,528 --> 00:44:55,261
你在找誰，fam？
Who you looking for, fam?

1227
00:44:55,263 --> 00:44:57,129
我是這所高中的校長，
I'm the principal of this high school,

1228
00:44:57,131 --> 00:44:59,634
我只是順道來看看
and I'm just dropping by to check on

1229
00:45:01,269 --> 00:45:02,702
他在這裡幹什麼？
What is he doing here?

1230
00:45:02,704 --> 00:45:05,772
和其他人一樣，我正在學習獲得GED
I'm studying to get my GED, like everybody else

1231
00:45:05,774 --> 00:45:10,109
所以，如果你不介意，我想重新學習
So, if you don't mind, I'd like to get back to learning

1232
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:13,479
當然可以
Of course

1233
00:45:13,481 --> 00:45:14,614
抱歉打斷你
My apologies for interrupting

1234
00:45:14,616 --> 00:45:16,148
謝謝你
Thank you

1235
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:19,418
事實上，我想觀察一下
Actually, I would like to observe

1236
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,354
一分鐘，如果可以的話
for a minute, if that's okay

1237
00:45:21,356 --> 00:45:24,524
請繼續解決這個問題
Please, continue solving the problem

1238
00:45:24,526 --> 00:45:26,327
忘記我在這裡
Forget I'm here

1239
00:45:27,629 --> 00:45:28,664
涼爽的
Cool

1240
00:45:29,765 --> 00:45:31,631
我不介意
That's fine with me

1241
00:45:31,633 --> 00:45:33,867
好吧，如果我要這麼做，
Okay, so if I'm gonna do this,

1242
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:35,868
讓我們一步一步地做，讓我們確保我們做得正確
let's do it step by step Let's make sure we do it right

1243
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:38,504
首先，讓我們擺脫這條線
First things first let's get rid of this line

1244
00:45:39,775 --> 00:45:41,340
因為它寫得很潦草
Because it's written sloppy

1245
00:45:41,342 --> 00:45:43,242
讓我們把那個嬰兒抱進去
So let's get that baby in there Eight

1246
00:45:43,244 --> 00:45:44,277
對吧？
Right?

1247
00:45:44,279 --> 00:45:45,411
嗯，我們有這三個方面
Huh We got these three sides

1248
00:45:45,413 --> 00:45:47,380
有甲，乙，丙。讓我們分開
Got A, B, C. Let's split that

1249
00:45:47,382 --> 00:45:48,581
就在那裡
That's there

1250
00:45:48,583 --> 00:45:49,715
把這兩個帶走
Take these twos away Mmm

1251
00:45:49,717 --> 00:45:51,216
他不知道答案
He don't know the answer

1252
00:45:51,218 --> 00:45:53,252
因為這讓你很困惑
Because that's what confuses you

1253
00:45:53,254 --> 00:45:56,188
然後
And then

1254
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:57,757
我意識到那是八！
I'm realizing what it is Eight!

1255
00:45:57,759 --> 00:45:59,191
答案是五
The answer's five

1256
00:45:59,193 --> 00:46:00,459
五點了
It's five

1257
00:46:00,461 --> 00:46:01,861
容易的
Easy

1258
00:46:01,863 --> 00:46:03,897
好吧，你看的是五平方
Okay, you're looking at five-squared

1259
00:46:03,899 --> 00:46:06,165
我在上面，我沒有時間
Me up here, I don't have time

1260
00:46:06,167 --> 00:46:08,367
我沒有時間為什麼我還要浪費時間？
I don't have time Why do I even waste my time?

1261
00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:09,802
我沒有時間浪費我的時間
I don't have time to waste my time

1262
00:46:09,804 --> 00:46:11,203
畢達哥拉斯定理很簡單
on the Pythagorean theorem It's simple

1263
00:46:11,205 --> 00:46:12,438
很簡單哇
It's simple Wow

1264
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,575
太令人印象深刻了，泰迪
That is very impressive, Teddy

1265
00:46:15,577 --> 00:46:17,376
非常令人印象深刻
Very impressive

1266
00:46:17,378 --> 00:46:20,479
我期待著看到你在期中考試中表現如何
I look forward to seeing how you do on the midterm

1267
00:46:20,481 --> 00:46:21,881
我的期中考試
My midterm

1268
00:46:21,883 --> 00:46:23,749
好
All right

1269
00:46:23,751 --> 00:46:25,585
我們結束了嗎，斯圖爾特，
Are we done here, Stewart,

1270
00:46:25,587 --> 00:46:28,621
或者你想今晚教其餘的課嗎？
or do you want to teach the rest of the class for tonight?

1271
00:46:28,623 --> 00:46:30,256
繼續，嘉莉
Carry on, Carrie

1272
00:46:30,258 --> 00:46:32,258
我不喜歡他的態度
I don't like his attitude

1273
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,161
你們都有一堂精彩的課
You all have a wonderful class

1274
00:46:35,396 --> 00:46:37,797
哦！什麼？
Oy! What?

1275
00:46:37,799 --> 00:46:40,499
天啊，那傢伙是個混蛋
God, that guy is a douchebag

1276
00:46:40,501 --> 00:46:42,401
我們只是要掩蓋事實嗎
Are we just gonna gloss over the fact

1277
00:46:42,403 --> 00:46:44,737
我們剛剛看了一場監獄爭鬥？
that we just watched a prison fight?

1278
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:46,806
我們還剩下幾節課？
How many classes do we have left?

1279
00:46:46,808 --> 00:46:49,574
我現在實際上必須工作四個小時
I actually have to work for four hours right now

1280
00:46:49,576 --> 00:46:52,812
如果你願意，我可以十美元送你回家
I can give you a ride home for ten bucks, if you want

1281
00:46:52,814 --> 00:46:54,647
嘿，凱莉。嘿
Hey, Carrie. Hey

1282
00:46:55,883 --> 00:46:57,650
你做的真酷
That was real cool what you did

1283
00:46:57,652 --> 00:46:59,351
對我來說，在黑板上
for me in there at the blackboard

1284
00:46:59,353 --> 00:47:00,352
你知道，這就是我所說的
You know, that's what I was talking about

1285
00:47:00,354 --> 00:47:01,887
當我只是說要互相照顧的時候。
when I just say watching out for each other.

1286
00:47:01,889 --> 00:47:04,557
你知道，你抓我的背，我會抓你的？
You know, you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours?

1287
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:06,559
哦，泰迪，不會再有背部抓痕了
Oh, there's not gonna be any more back-scratching, Teddy

1288
00:47:06,561 --> 00:47:08,761
那是最後一次
That's the last time that happens

1289
00:47:08,763 --> 00:47:11,764
你到底在董事會裡到底發生了什麼？
And what was really going on with you at the board anyways?

1290
00:47:11,766 --> 00:47:12,765
沒有任何東西
Nothing

1291
00:47:12,767 --> 00:47:14,332
沒有任何東西
Nothing

1292
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:16,569
不，我只是沒有準備好
No, I was just I wasn't prepared

1293
00:47:16,571 --> 00:47:18,638
如果你不想做這項工作，那就下課吧
If you're not gonna do the work, drop the class

1294
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,772
你為什麼要...？不，凱莉
Why would you...? No, Carrie

1295
00:47:19,774 --> 00:47:21,741
嘿，我要做這項工作
Hey, I'm gonna do the work

1296
00:47:21,743 --> 00:47:23,341
你會看到的，我們會看到的
You'll see We'll see

1297
00:47:23,343 --> 00:47:25,443
是的，我們會很棒的
Yes, we will Great

1298
00:47:25,445 --> 00:47:26,946
極好的
Superb Excellent

1299
00:47:26,948 --> 00:47:28,347
很好
Good Mm-hmm

1300
00:47:34,789 --> 00:47:36,688
欺騙
Shit

1301
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,759
親愛的，我回來了
Honey, I'm home

1302
00:47:42,997 --> 00:47:44,699
你睡著了嗎？
You sleeping?

1303
00:47:45,867 --> 00:47:47,467
你起來了？
You up?

1304
00:47:57,344 --> 00:47:59,411
對不起
Excuse me

1305
00:47:59,413 --> 00:48:01,346
戰利品看起來不錯，不是嗎？
Booty look good, don't it?

1306
00:48:01,348 --> 00:48:03,849
可惜你的臉會夾在書中間
Too bad your face gonna be in between them books

1307
00:48:03,851 --> 00:48:05,518
而不是臉頰
and not them cheeks

1308
00:48:07,021 --> 00:48:08,388
去學習
Go study

1309
00:48:10,557 --> 00:48:11,591
我不想學習
I don't want to study

1310
00:48:12,859 --> 00:48:14,459
嗯
Mmm

1311
00:48:17,532 --> 00:48:19,865
來吧，泰迪。集中
Come on, Teddy. Focus

1312
00:48:19,867 --> 00:48:21,299
集中精神，泰迪

集中精神！
Focus!

1314
00:48:25,772 --> 00:48:27,505
你永遠不會得到它！
You'll never get it!

1315
00:48:27,507 --> 00:48:29,475
還給我！
Give it back!

1316
00:48:29,477 --> 00:48:31,609
嘿，夥計們，這是我的演示
Hey, guys, this is my demo

1317
00:48:31,611 --> 00:48:33,511
不管需要什麼，你知道
No matter what it takes, you know

1318
00:48:33,513 --> 00:48:35,447
我會一直戰鬥下去
I'm always gonna keep on fighting

1319
00:48:35,449 --> 00:48:36,715
我在戰鬥
I'm fighting

1320
00:48:38,618 --> 00:48:40,786
小麥克！你在做什麼?
Little Mac! What are you doing?

1321
00:48:40,788 --> 00:48:42,320
那是我的手機那些是我的筆記
That's my phone Those were my notes

1322
00:48:42,322 --> 00:48:43,555
你應該學習
You should be studying

1323
00:48:43,557 --> 00:48:45,925
到底怎麼回事？別像個混蛋
What the hell? Don't be such a dick

1324
00:48:45,927 --> 00:48:47,292
你會學習的！我恨你！
You're gonna study! I hate you!

1325
00:48:48,628 --> 00:48:49,928
那個比薩餅的周長是多少？
What's the circumference of that pizza?

1326
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:50,929

1327
00:48:50,931 --> 00:48:53,498
告訴我，比薩餅上有多少胡椒？
Just tell me, how many pepperonis on the pizza?

1328
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,599
我給你一顆星
I'm giving you one star

1329
00:48:54,601 --> 00:48:56,668
我要把你送到一個糟糕的社區
I'm gonna drop you off here in a bad neighborhood

1330
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:57,769
那怎麼樣？
How about that?

1331
00:48:57,771 --> 00:48:59,637
特裡薩！
Theresa!

1332
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:01,005
現在是10點以後。你好！
It's after 10:00. Hello!

1333

世界上最可愛的人

1335
00:49:03,945 --> 00:49:06,078
還有人想試試這個嗎？
Does anybody else want to try to take a crack at this?

1336
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,379
我現在有點忙，嗯！
I'm kind of busy right now Mmm!

1337
00:49:08,381 --> 00:49:10,014
寶貝，你看到我的巫術了嗎？
Babe, you seen my Wite-Out?

1338
00:49:10,016 --> 00:49:12,016
什麼...？哦，不
What the...? Oh, hell no

1339
00:49:12,018 --> 00:49:13,618
屈麗娜
Trina

1340
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:16,789
什麼，什麼，什麼，你現在有機器人側迪克了嗎？
What-what-what-what, you got robotic side dick now?

1341
00:49:16,791 --> 00:49:18,690
肥驢。
Fat asses.

1342
00:49:18,692 --> 00:49:20,759
你知道胖驢喜歡什麼嗎？
You know what fat asses like?

1343
00:49:20,761 --> 00:49:22,427
有真正工作的男人
Dudes that have a real job

1344
00:49:22,429 --> 00:49:24,362
泰迪！滾出去
Teddy! Get your ass out

1345
00:49:24,364 --> 00:49:26,530
泰迪，如果你沒有通過期中考試，
Teddy, if you don't pass that midterm,

1346
00:49:26,532 --> 00:49:28,433
沒有回家的女孩和你在一起
no way homegirl stays with you

1347
00:49:28,435 --> 00:49:29,869
嗯？
Huh?

1348
00:49:29,871 --> 00:49:31,603
想想看
Think about that

1349
00:49:31,605 --> 00:49:32,971
我們必須偷考試
We're gonna have to steal the test

1350
00:49:32,973 --> 00:49:33,972
驚歎聲
Whoa

1351
00:49:33,974 --> 00:49:35,440
思想融合了
Mind meld

1352
00:49:35,442 --> 00:49:36,875
我也是這麼想的
I was thinking the exact same thing

1353
00:49:36,877 --> 00:49:38,442
如果我們是真實的，
If we being real with it,

1354
00:49:38,444 --> 00:49:40,012
我需要盡可能多的幫助
I need as much help as I can get

1355
00:49:40,014 --> 00:49:42,981
從瓶蓋到斜邊等等，
Going from capping bottles to hypotenuses and all that,

1356
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:45,483
我同樣被材料搞糊塗了
I'm just as confounded by the material

1357
00:49:45,485 --> 00:49:47,685
你們都感受到我了嗎？
as the rest of y'all Feel me?

1358
00:49:47,687 --> 00:49:50,587
我真的很不願意承認，但是語言障礙
I really hate to admit it, but with the language barrier

1359
00:49:50,589 --> 00:49:53,125
所有的提升動力都來自於我的腿，
and all the Lyft driving I've been doing,

1360
00:49:53,127 --> 00:49:54,926
我也在掙扎，夥計們
I'm struggling as well, guys

1361
00:49:54,928 --> 00:49:57,764
我覺得雀躍聽起來很有趣
I think a caper sounds fun

1362
00:49:59,499 --> 00:50:01,132
特裡薩，你什麼時候來的？
When'd you get here, Theresa?

1363
00:50:01,134 --> 00:50:03,001
哦，我一直都在這裡
Oh, I've been here the whole time

1364
00:50:03,003 --> 00:50:04,636
人們從未注意到我
People never notice me

1365
00:50:04,638 --> 00:50:06,504
它總是發生
It happens all the time It's

1366
00:50:06,506 --> 00:50:08,907
有點像超級大國，但是
kind of like a superpower, but

1367
00:50:08,909 --> 00:50:11,545
伴隨著極度孤獨的人
one that comes with a crushing loneliness

1368
00:50:14,814 --> 00:50:17,448
我很幸運。我真幸運
I'm blessed. I'm so blessed

1369
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:19,150
是的，上帝很好
Yeah, God is good

1370
00:50:19,152 --> 00:50:20,451
嗯
Mm-hmm

1371
00:50:20,453 --> 00:50:21,920
行
Okay

1372
00:50:21,922 --> 00:50:24,055
嘿，米拉，你呢？
Hey, Mila, what about you?

1373
00:50:24,057 --> 00:50:25,824
我父母會很生氣的
My parents are gonna be really pissed

1374
00:50:25,826 --> 00:50:27,393
如果我再次被捕
if I get busted again

1375
00:50:28,728 --> 00:50:30,495
是的，我在我在
Yeah, I'm in I'm in

1376
00:50:30,497 --> 00:50:31,429
這就是我說的好吧
That's what I'm talking about All right

1377
00:50:31,431 --> 00:50:33,932
在我們這樣做之前，我只有一個問題
I just have one question before we do this

1378
00:50:33,934 --> 00:50:35,666
怎麼了？泰迪為什麼會這樣
What's up? Why does Teddy get to be

1379
00:50:35,668 --> 00:50:36,767
首要分子，夥計們？開始
the ringleader, guys? Come on

1380
00:50:36,769 --> 00:50:38,535
該死，路易斯，現在不行
Goddamn it, Luis Not now

1381
00:50:38,537 --> 00:50:41,139
我是說，說真的，夥計？這是他的主意
I mean, seriously, man? It was his idea

1382
00:50:41,141 --> 00:50:43,408
他比我們任何人都更瞭解這所學校
He knows this school better than any of us

1383
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:45,076
啊。不要在意事實
Ah. Just never mind the fact

1384
00:50:45,078 --> 00:50:47,678
我偷偷溜進一個小地方
that I snuck into a little place

1385
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,147
叫做美國
called America

1386
00:50:49,149 --> 00:50:50,881
哈！這是真的！
Ha! That's true!

1387
00:50:50,883 --> 00:50:53,017
路易斯今晚很熱
Luis is hot tonight

1388
00:51:28,588 --> 00:51:30,121
喲，T什麼？
Yo, T What?

1389
00:51:30,123 --> 00:51:31,856
我很感謝你帶來
I appreciate you bringing

1390
00:51:31,858 --> 00:51:33,757
這個神奇的，熾熱的撒旦雞
this amazing, blazing Satan chicken

1391
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,159
好像很熱，但不是
It's like, it's hot, but it's not

1392
00:51:35,161 --> 00:51:37,161
我不喜歡辛辣的食物，但是這個
And I don't like spicy food, but this one

1393
00:51:37,163 --> 00:51:40,665
讓我告訴你還有什麼是熱的...你的呼吸
Let me tell you what else is hot... your breath

1394
00:51:40,667 --> 00:51:43,101
你為什麼那樣在我臉上呼吸？
Why are you breathing on the side of my face like that?

1395
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:45,535
哦，你在我耳邊輕敲，夥計。停止
Oh You're smacking all in my ear, man. Stop

1396
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:48,705
你還在打
You're still smacking

1397
00:51:48,707 --> 00:51:50,507
該死，你完蛋了，你完蛋了
Goddamn it, you're done You're done

1398
00:51:50,509 --> 00:51:51,609
你完了
You're done with that

1399
00:51:51,611 --> 00:51:53,878
真的嗎？
Really?

1400
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,712
上帝，你有什麼問題？
God, what-what is your problem, man?

1401
00:51:55,714 --> 00:51:58,216
什麼？我說穿全黑。你為什麼不穿黑色？
What? I said wear all black. Why didn't you wear black?

1402
00:51:58,218 --> 00:52:01,084
洗衣日我所有的黑暗都在洗
Laundry day All my darks were in the wash

1403
00:52:01,086 --> 00:52:02,486
所以你穿黃色？
So you wore yellow?

1404
00:52:02,488 --> 00:52:03,821
很新鮮。很乾淨
It's fresh. It's clean

1405
00:52:03,823 --> 00:52:05,790
把你的胳膊從我臉上拿開
Get your get your arm out my face

1406
00:52:05,792 --> 00:52:07,158
滾出我的臉
Get out of my face

1407
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,060
聚焦。走吧
Focus. Let's go

1408
00:52:09,062 --> 00:52:10,796
我們走吧
Let's go

1409
00:52:12,131 --> 00:52:13,797
喲，泰迪，演什麼，夥計？
Yo, Teddy, what's the play, man?

1410
00:52:13,799 --> 00:52:15,800
昨晚我看見看門人打掃衛生
Last night I saw the janitor cleaning

1411
00:52:15,802 --> 00:52:17,902
晚上8點左右斯圖爾特的辦公室
Stewart's office around 8:00 p.m

1412
00:52:17,904 --> 00:52:20,038
我明白了，那是內線，嗯？
I get it that's the inside man, huh?

1413
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,039
不，鮑比，他不是我的內線
No, Bobby, he's not my inside man

1414
00:52:22,041 --> 00:52:23,976
他是看門人
He's the janitor

1415
00:52:28,181 --> 00:52:29,847
哦，媽的
Oh, shit

1416
00:52:29,849 --> 00:52:32,183
我要拿這個，我要拿
I got to take this, I got to take it

1417
00:52:32,185 --> 00:52:33,850
媽的
Sh-Shit

1418
00:52:33,852 --> 00:52:36,253
哦
Aw

1419
00:52:36,255 --> 00:52:38,055
不，不，不
No, no, no

1420
00:52:43,029 --> 00:52:44,228
嘿，寶貝
Hey, babe

1421
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:46,129
嘿，寶貝，我想你
Hey, baby, I miss you

1422
00:52:46,131 --> 00:52:47,931
你還在工作嗎？
Are you still at work?

1423
00:52:47,933 --> 00:52:51,768
嗯，是的，是的，現在我在，呃，我在休息室
Uh, yeah, yeah, right now I'm in the, uh, I'm in the break room

1424
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:53,837
我能參觀一下辦公室嗎？
Can I get a tour of the office?

1425
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:56,274
如果我的孩子想去旅遊，那麼她可以去旅遊
If my baby wants a tour, then she can get a tour

1426
00:52:56,276 --> 00:52:57,975
你總是想看東西啊！
You always want to see something Ah!

1427
00:52:57,977 --> 00:52:58,976
如果我哦，泰迪
If I Oh, Teddy

1428
00:52:58,978 --> 00:53:00,277
嘿，泰迪，哦
Hey Teddy, oh

1429
00:53:00,279 --> 00:53:02,745
我們這裡有情況，我們有真實的
We got a situation here, we got a real

1430
00:53:02,747 --> 00:53:04,614
熱熔岩，熱熔岩什麼？嘿
Hot lava, hot lava What? Hey

1431
00:53:04,616 --> 00:53:05,882
好吧
Okay Um

1432
00:53:05,884 --> 00:53:07,718
哦，上帝，哦，上帝，哦，上帝，哦，上帝！
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!

1433
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:08,919
啊！世界衛生大會...？
Aah! Wha...?

1434
00:53:08,921 --> 00:53:10,053
天啊，烏龜頭伸出來了
God, turtle head sticking out

1435
00:53:10,055 --> 00:53:11,321
哦，那是一個大的，呃
Oh, that's a big one Uh

1436
00:53:11,323 --> 00:53:13,689
寶貝，那邊發生了什麼？哦，大狗屎
Babe, what is going on over there? Oh, big shit

1437
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:15,058
親愛的，那是，呃，事實上
Honey, that's, uh, that's actually

1438
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,960
那實際上是我的一個客戶經理
that's actually one of my account managers

1439
00:53:17,796 --> 00:53:19,896
辦公室裡到處都是個性
Personalities all over the office

1440
00:53:19,898 --> 00:53:21,031
呃，不停地笑
Uh, nonstop laughs

1441
00:53:21,033 --> 00:53:22,332
熾熱的熔岩！直達車
Hot lava! Nonstop

1442
00:53:22,334 --> 00:53:23,934
你知道我是怎麼做的
You know how I do

1443
00:53:23,936 --> 00:53:25,869
玩耍...在辦公室
play around... at the office

1444
00:53:27,307 --> 00:53:28,306
誰...？嘿，喲，怎麼了，兄弟？
Who's...? Hey, yo, what's up, bro?

1445
00:53:28,308 --> 00:53:30,274
你掛了我電話，夥計
You hung up on me, man

1446
00:53:30,276 --> 00:53:32,075
那是誰？那是我的，
Who's that? That's one of my,

1447
00:53:32,077 --> 00:53:33,910
那是我的一個客戶，就在那裡
that's one of my clients there, right there

1448
00:53:33,912 --> 00:53:35,912
是啊，我們正在檢查他的投資組合
Yeah, we were, we were going over his portfolio

1449
00:53:35,914 --> 00:53:37,580
看起來他在監獄裡
Kind of looks like he's in prison

1450
00:53:37,582 --> 00:53:39,983
哦，我的上帝，你真漂亮，寶貝
Oh, my God, you're so beautiful, baby

1451
00:53:39,985 --> 00:53:41,651
嗯，他看起來像那樣
Well, he looks like that

1452
00:53:41,653 --> 00:53:43,954
因為他是...內幕交易
cause he is... insider trading

1453
00:53:43,956 --> 00:53:45,789
他被錯誤地指控
He was wrongfully accused

1454
00:53:45,791 --> 00:53:48,624
你看起來像J洛和碧昂斯，媽媽
You're looking like J.Lo and Beyonce, mama

1455
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:50,293
你介意帶我看看你的私處嗎？
Would you mind showing me your privates?

1456
00:53:50,295 --> 00:53:51,762
夠了，鮑比
Enough, Bobby

1457
00:53:51,764 --> 00:53:53,096
比如，轉過身來，讓我看看那個屁股，
Like, turn around, let me see that ass,

1458
00:53:53,098 --> 00:53:54,631
拜託，一點小妮子，什麼的
please, a little tit, something

1459
00:53:54,633 --> 00:53:55,966
對不起？
Excuse me?

1460
00:53:55,968 --> 00:53:57,300
我現在很強壯
I'm, like, really strong right now

1461
00:53:57,302 --> 00:54:00,203
就像，我可以對你做一些傳奇般的事情
Like, I could do things to you legendary shit

1462
00:54:00,205 --> 00:54:01,171
夠了，鮑比
Enough, Bobby

1463
00:54:01,173 --> 00:54:02,972
我會穿上大腿，但是，說真的，
I'll take some upper thigh, but, for real,

1464
00:54:02,974 --> 00:54:05,208
我真的很想看一些普納尼
I really want to see some punani

1465
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:06,176
對不起？
Excuse me?

1466
00:54:06,178 --> 00:54:08,211
聽...哦，我的上帝
Listen... oh, my God

1467
00:54:08,213 --> 00:54:09,279
我不知道你在我身上放了什麼
I don't know what you put in me

1468
00:54:09,281 --> 00:54:10,280
它剛剛擊中了我
It just hit me

1469
00:54:10,282 --> 00:54:11,714
但是感覺像魔鬼！
But it feels like the Devil!

1470
00:54:11,716 --> 00:54:14,083
他說的話正好擊中了我，親愛的
It just hit me what he said, honey

1471
00:54:14,085 --> 00:54:15,319
他在說皮諾塔。
He's saying pinata.

1472
00:54:15,321 --> 00:54:17,654
夥計，我很久沒見到普納尼了
Man, I ain't see some punani in so long

1473
00:54:17,656 --> 00:54:19,122
鮑比喜歡打菠蘿
Bobby likes to hit pinatas

1474
00:54:19,124 --> 00:54:20,656
不！讓我...你知道我要做什麼嗎？
No! Let me... you know what I'm gonna do?

1475
00:54:20,658 --> 00:54:21,958
讓我，讓我給你回電話
Let me, let me call you back

1476
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:22,893
我愛你，
Uh I love you,

1477
00:54:22,895 --> 00:54:25,095
我呢...等我結束了，我們就去旅遊
and I... we'll do the tour when I'm done

1478
00:54:25,097 --> 00:54:26,929
再見，寶貝
Bye, babe

1479
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:28,231
那是什麼，鮑比？
What was that, Bobby?

1480
00:54:28,233 --> 00:54:30,000
喲，泰德，好看嗎，兄弟
Yo, Ted, good looking, bro

1481
00:54:30,002 --> 00:54:31,368
那是我未婚妻
That's my fiancee, man

1482
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:32,601
你不要這樣和她說話
You don't talk to her like that

1483
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:36,339
當我回到牢房時，我得到了傳說中的襪子
When I go back to the cell, I got the legendary socky-sock

1484
00:54:36,341 --> 00:54:38,707
你不會和我的女人談襪子吧
You're not having a sock session to my woman

1485
00:54:38,709 --> 00:54:40,177
那是不會發生的
That's, that's not going to happen

1486
00:54:40,179 --> 00:54:42,245
我要全力以赴
I'm going all out

1487
00:54:43,248 --> 00:54:44,814
好吧，你屁股裡有什麼，麥克？
Okay, what is in your ass, Mac?

1488
00:54:44,816 --> 00:54:46,782
饒了我吧，夥計
Cut me a break, man

1489
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:47,585
我受夠了！
I've had enough!

1490
00:54:50,188 --> 00:54:52,322
等一下，我們有一個紅色的密碼
Hold on a second, we got a code red

1491
00:54:52,324 --> 00:54:54,091
我們有紅色代碼
We got a code red

1492
00:54:54,093 --> 00:54:55,859
泰迪，我沒有衛生紙
Teddy, I got no toilet paper

1493
00:54:55,861 --> 00:54:58,095
衛生紙，泰迪，曾經的我！
Toilet paper, Teddy, one-time me!

1494
00:54:58,097 --> 00:54:59,129
一次性的我！
One-time me!

1495
00:54:59,131 --> 00:55:00,898
泰迪！
Teddy!

1496
00:55:06,138 --> 00:55:07,870
好了，夥計們，聽著
All right, guys, listen

1497
00:55:07,872 --> 00:55:09,705
當看門人離開時，
When the janitor exits,

1498
00:55:09,707 --> 00:55:11,408
我們要出去，我們要抓住門
we're gonna go out, we're gonna catch the door

1499
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:13,309
然後我們會悄悄地進去
And then we're gonna enter quietly

1500
00:55:13,311 --> 00:55:14,612
好吧好吧？
Okay Okay?

1501
00:55:15,881 --> 00:55:17,015
等一下
Wait a minute

1502
00:55:18,016 --> 00:55:19,249
巨無霸在哪裡？
Where's Big Mac?

1503
00:55:19,251 --> 00:55:21,184
我以為他和我們在一起
I thought he was with us

1504
00:55:21,186 --> 00:55:23,085
他
He

1505
00:55:23,087 --> 00:55:24,755
該死!
Damn it

1506
00:55:30,429 --> 00:55:31,896
他在做什麼？
What's he doing?

1507
00:55:37,301 --> 00:55:39,236
哦，我的上帝，你在做什麼？
Oh, my God What are you doing?

1508
00:55:39,238 --> 00:55:41,039
來吧，來吧，來吧，來吧，麥克！
Come on, come on, come on, come on Mac!

1509
00:55:43,275 --> 00:55:45,975
媽的，它奏效了哦，我的上帝！
Holy shit, it worked Oh, my God!

1510
00:55:45,977 --> 00:55:47,143
麥克！
Mac!

1511
00:55:47,145 --> 00:55:48,244
你剛剛殺了他嗎？
Did you just kill him?

1512
00:55:48,246 --> 00:55:49,245
不，我沒有殺他
No, I didn't kill him

1513
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,246
我把他掐死了
I just choked him out

1514
00:55:50,248 --> 00:55:51,281
你說沒有證人
You said no witnesses

1515
00:55:51,283 --> 00:55:52,748
我什麼時候說過的？
When did I say that?

1516
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:54,119
你沒這麼說？
You didn't say that?

1517
00:55:55,187 --> 00:55:56,219
哦，上帝
Oh, God

1518
00:55:56,221 --> 00:55:57,287
你知道嗎？
You know what?

1519
00:55:57,289 --> 00:55:58,888
我的信號被越過了
I got my signals crossed

1520
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:00,723
有很多指示，泰迪
There's a lot of instructions, Teddy

1521
00:56:00,725 --> 00:56:02,124
我什麼也沒說
I didn't say anything about

1522
00:56:02,126 --> 00:56:04,961
你知道嗎？你會解決這個問題的
You know what? You are going to fix this

1523
00:56:04,963 --> 00:56:06,795
你聽到了嗎，麥克？你要把屍體藏起來
Do you hear me, Mac? You're gonna hide this body

1524
00:56:06,797 --> 00:56:08,831
砍他？隱藏
Chop him up? Hide

1525
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:10,733
燒掉它？藏起來
Burn it? Hide it

1526
00:56:10,735 --> 00:56:11,736
砍、燒、埋？
Chop, burn, bury?

1527
00:56:14,305 --> 00:56:16,208
嘿。有人有什麼消息嗎？不
Hey. Anybody got anything? No

1528
00:56:17,742 --> 00:56:19,041
好吧，Mila，我們看起來怎麼樣？
All right, Mila, how we looking?

1529
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:20,843
繼續看
Keep looking

1530
00:56:20,845 --> 00:56:23,479
吸我的蛋蛋，泰迪！欺騙
Suck my balls, Teddy! Shit

1531
00:56:23,481 --> 00:56:25,814
媽的，你應該看看你的臉
Shit You should've seen your face

1532
00:56:25,816 --> 00:56:28,118
你看起來很可笑噓！
You look ridiculous Shh!

1533
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,852
好吧，我把屍體藏起來，
All right, I stashed the body,

1534
00:56:29,854 --> 00:56:31,887
如果上帝願意，他幾小時後就會醒來
and God willing, he'll wake up in a couple hours

1535
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,856
此外，棒球教練主要人物，
Also, that baseball coach principal guy,

1536
00:56:33,858 --> 00:56:35,324
他在路上
he's on his way

1537
00:56:35,326 --> 00:56:37,326
什麼？你為什麼不帶頭呢？
What? Why wouldn't you lead with that?

1538
00:56:40,932 --> 00:56:43,332
該死。這是家長會
Damn. It's the PTA meeting

1539
00:56:43,334 --> 00:56:45,203
哦，媽的
Oh, shit

1540
00:56:46,337 --> 00:56:48,204
特裡薩，你起來了
Theresa, you're up

1541
00:56:48,206 --> 00:56:49,371
什麼？什麼？我聽我說
What? What? I Listen to me

1542
00:56:49,373 --> 00:56:51,074
好吧，我需要你出去，
Okay I need you to go out there,

1543
00:56:51,076 --> 00:56:52,275
我需要你停下來
and I need you to stall

1544
00:56:52,277 --> 00:56:53,809
哦，不，不，不，不，不，我不能調情
Oh, no, no, no, no I can't flirt

1545
00:56:53,811 --> 00:56:55,177
我不知道我有什麼舉動，我不需要
I-I don't know any moves I-I don't need that

1546
00:56:55,179 --> 00:56:56,546
從1996年開始，我就沒有調情了，即使在那時，
I haven't flirted since like 1996, and even then,

1547
00:56:56,548 --> 00:56:58,314
這就像給警察一個方便的機會
it was like offering to give the cop a handy

1548
00:56:58,316 --> 00:56:59,949
從超速罰單上下來，猜猜看
to get off a speeding ticket, and guess what

1549
00:56:59,951 --> 00:57:01,317
他沒有接受，我不擅長
He didn't take it I'm bad at it

1550
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:02,551
這不是我要你做的
That's not what I'm asking you to do

1551
00:57:02,553 --> 00:57:03,953
在我的時代，這真的是無辜的
In my day, it was really innocent

1552
00:57:03,955 --> 00:57:05,422
現在一切都是關於屁股的
Now it's all about the butt

1553
00:57:05,424 --> 00:57:06,922
前幾天我聽到一個人說，
I heard a guy the other day say,

1554
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:09,825
我要像核桃一樣敲碎屁股。
I'm gonna crack that butt like a walnut.

1555
00:57:09,827 --> 00:57:11,826
什麼？那是什麼意思？
What? What does that even mean?

1556
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:13,229
你為什麼要從那裡開始？得了
Why would you start there? Stop it

1557
00:57:13,231 --> 00:57:14,996
你不想從前面開始嗎？
Wouldn't you want to start in the front?

1558
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:16,499
特裡薩，聽著，以一個很好的傳教立場，
Theresa, listen With a nice missionary position,

1559
00:57:16,501 --> 00:57:18,467
你知道，一些溫柔的撫摸
you know, some gentle touching

1560
00:57:18,469 --> 00:57:20,069
在我的日子裡，也許你一生中有一次，
In my day, maybe once in your lifetime,

1561
00:57:20,071 --> 00:57:21,904
你可能會得到一個小拇指的末端，
you might get the end of a pinky,

1562
00:57:21,906 --> 00:57:23,372
這是一生中最激動人心的事，好嗎？
and that was the thrill of a lifetime, okay?

1563
00:57:23,374 --> 00:57:25,274
住手，這是很多信息
Stop it That's a lot of information

1564
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:26,841
我不需要知道
that I did not need to know

1565
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:27,943
是的，那是很多
Yeah, that was a lot

1566
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:29,445
去談談烘焙銷售

1567
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:31,013
媽媽的東西。不是，不是屁股的東西是的，媽媽的東西

1573
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:41,257
好嗎？
Okay?

1574

1575
00:57:46,464 --> 00:57:47,996
尋找活板門
Looking for trapdoors

1576
00:57:50,468 --> 00:57:52,368
我很高興你在這裡，麥克

嗯，我能幫你什麼嗎？

So my child gets an assignment about the solar system,

1596
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:24,433
這是一個立體圖，
and it's to make a diorama,

1597
00:58:24,435 --> 00:58:26,100
他不知道如何製作立體佈景
and he doesn't know how to make a diorama

1598
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:27,503
我是那個拿著熱膠槍的人

I mean, don't get me wrong, we're blessed to go to

1611
00:58:47,458 --> 00:58:48,890
我感到頭暈
I feel faint

1612
00:58:48,892 --> 00:58:50,391
好吧，我們給你弄些水來
Well, let's get you some water

1613
00:58:50,393 --> 00:58:52,094

1617
00:59:00,503 --> 00:59:02,437
你牙齒裡有什麼東西嗎？

1618
00:59:02,439 --> 00:59:05,307

Okay, no, I didn't realize that's what this was

1620
00:59:07,578 --> 00:59:09,143

No, thank you, ma'am Gentle touching

1621

我不參與這件事！

1625
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:15,084
你不必參加專業

1626

輕點它！我不能
Just tap it! I can't

1642
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:39,041
我不能站在這裡，好嗎？

1643

好好享受吧晚安

1644

來吧，給它一些

1645

她非常想要你
She wanted you so bad

1647
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:50,251
但是你不能去那裡
But you can't go there

1648
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,621
校長有原則
Principals have principles

1649
00:59:52,623 --> 00:59:55,390
嗯。哦，但是你認識史泰威
Mmm. Oh, but you know Stewie

1651
00:59:58,461 --> 01:00:00,561
不是黑色的聲音
Not a black voice

1652
01:00:05,603 --> 01:00:08,336
讓我們看看
Let's see

這裡有人嗎？
Somebody in here?

1655
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:56,619
我有球棒
I have a bat

1656
01:00:57,687 --> 01:00:59,220
我不怕用它
And I'm not afraid to use it

1657
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:02,222
如果有人在這裡，
If there is someone in here,

1658
01:01:02,224 --> 01:01:03,661
你擅自闖入
you are trespassing

1659
01:01:04,728 --> 01:01:08,062
我完全在我的權利範圍內
And I am well within my rights

1660
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:09,564
為自己辯護
to defend myself

1661
01:01:09,566 --> 01:01:12,300
所以出來吧，
So come on out,

我不會打你的頭
and I won't bash your head

1663
01:01:15,706 --> 01:01:18,272
救命！
Help!

1664
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:19,740
外面有人嗎？
Anybody out there?

1665
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,211
帶我離開這裡！
Get me out of here!

1666
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:27,381
驚歎聲
Whoa

1667
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:29,650
好吧，怎麼回事，麥克？
Okay What the hell, Mac?

1668
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:31,752
你說得對，麥克
That was close You're damn right it was, Mac

1669
01:01:31,754 --> 01:01:33,154
我想知道為什麼
I wonder why

1670
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:34,689
是的，我...因為我打噴嚏了
Yeah, I... well, it's 'cause I sneezed

1671
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,156
我知道你做了什麼
I know what you did

1672
01:01:36,158 --> 01:01:37,625
什麼？
What?

1673
01:01:37,627 --> 01:01:39,128
我明白了
I got it

1674
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:43,364
我真的試過我甚至做過屁股的事
I really tried I even did the butt stuff

1675
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,198
我告訴過你不要做屁股的事
I told you don't do the butt stuff

1676
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,334
我不知道，fam，可能有用
I don't know, fam, might've worked

1677
01:01:46,336 --> 01:01:48,368
看起來他可能把抽屜弄髒了，真的
Looked like he might've sauced his drawers, real talk

1678
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:49,670
他什麼？
He what?

1679
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:51,205
他被打開了
He-he was turned on

1680
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:52,273
真的嗎？
Really?

1681
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:53,341
媽的，我也是
Shit, I was, too

1682
01:01:53,343 --> 01:01:54,342
嘿

謝謝，傑倫
Thanks, Jaylen

1684
01:01:55,578 --> 01:01:57,478
你有一種環保的感覺
You got that little eco-friendly vibe going

1685
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,713
什麼是生態友好的？
What's eco-friendly?

1686
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,146
很少浪費
Very little waste

1687
01:02:00,148 --> 01:02:02,349
哦，我以為你指的是她的灌木叢
Oh, I thought you meant her bush

1688
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:04,685
不，哦，你知道嗎？我同意

Yeah, let's go Come on, come on

1693
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,227
欺騙
Shit

1694
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:17,832
誰在外面？
Who's out there?

1695
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:20,703
誰來幫我
Somebody help me, please

1696
01:02:23,438 --> 01:02:25,105
發生什麼事了？
What happened?

1697
01:02:25,107 --> 01:02:26,673
我不知道有人從後面抓住了我
I don't know Someone grabbed me from behind

1698
01:02:26,675 --> 01:02:28,543
把我扔進污水池
and threw me in the slop sink

1699
01:02:28,545 --> 01:02:30,545
遊戲臉，朗尼
Game face, Lonnie

1700
01:02:30,547 --> 01:02:33,446
我們被封鎖了
We're on lockdown

1701
01:02:33,448 --> 01:02:34,782
啊，是啊！
Ah, yeah!

01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:37,284
那會得到他的嘿！

哦。嘿，鮑比
Oh. Hey, Bobby

鮑比，這是真的，夥計，我們該怎麼辦？
Bobby, shit just got real, man, what do we do?

1708
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:50,697
夥計，我不知道，只是不要被槍殺，兄弟
Man, I don't know, just don't get shot, bro

1709
01:02:50,699 --> 01:02:51,832
你什麼意思，不被槍斃？
What do you mean, don't get shot?

1710
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:53,701
鮑比，你應該是個頑固的罪犯，夥計
Bobby, you're supposed to be a hardened criminal, man

1711
01:02:53,703 --> 01:02:55,536
那不可能是你的建議
That can't be your advice

1712
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:57,404
鮑比，你去監獄幹什麼？
What the hell'd you go to jail for, Bobby?

1713
01:02:57,406 --> 01:02:59,339
我搶了全食，兄弟
I robbed Whole Foods, bro

1714
01:02:59,341 --> 01:03:00,740
我搶了全食
I robbed Whole Foods

1715
01:03:00,742 --> 01:03:02,175
那是你的罪行？
That's your crime?

1716
01:03:02,177 --> 01:03:04,745
你因為偷了15美元的萵苣而進了監獄？
You went to jail for stealing $15 lettuce?

1717
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:06,581
不，兄弟，你在睡覺
No, bro, you're sleeping

1718
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:09,249
我白天搬了一些可樂和毒品，但是我的羽衣甘藍遊戲
I moved some coke and some dope in the day, but my kale game

1719
01:03:09,251 --> 01:03:11,384
我的羽衣甘藍遊戲不
my kale game No

1720
01:03:11,386 --> 01:03:12,385
現在，這是卑鄙的！
Now, that's mean!

1721
01:03:12,387 --> 01:03:13,887
草餵牛肉
Grass-fed beef

1722
01:03:13,889 --> 01:03:16,256
你對沒有自由放養的雞一無所知
You don't know nothing about no free-range chicken

1723
01:03:16,258 --> 01:03:18,291
暴徒生活！傑倫，冷靜...安靜
Thug life! Jaylen, calm... calm down

1724
01:03:18,293 --> 01:03:19,894

And I had all the farmer markets on smash No, no

1725
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:21,428
你不用解釋
You don't get to explain

1726
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:23,296
你沒必要說髒話...再見
You don't get to expla... Bye

1727
01:03:23,298 --> 01:03:24,664
好吧，你們，這邊
All right, y'all, this way

1728
01:03:24,666 --> 01:03:25,665
注意，入侵者
Attention, intruders

1729
01:03:25,667 --> 01:03:27,335
這是帕特斯基校長
This is Principal Patowsky

1730
01:03:27,337 --> 01:03:30,905
安全門被鎖上了，無路可逃
The exit doors are locked down There is no escape

1731
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:34,374
我不敢相信我們會因為GED練習考試而死去
I-I can't believe we're gonna die over a GED practice test

1732
01:03:34,376 --> 01:03:35,642
這甚至不是真正的測試聽著
It's not even a real test Listen

1733
01:03:35,644 --> 01:03:37,544
我這樣做只是為了走出家門
I just did this to get out of the house

1734
01:03:37,546 --> 01:03:38,846
我以為這會很有趣
I thought this was gonna be fun

1735
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:40,180
你知道，我們會破門而入
You know, we're gonna break in

1736
01:03:40,182 --> 01:03:41,414
閉嘴！閉嘴！
Just shut up! Just shut up!

1737
01:03:41,416 --> 01:03:43,918
閉嘴！該死的！
Shut up! Goddamn!

1738
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,453
整天都在談論你的孩子和一切！
Been talking about your kids and everything all day!

1739
01:03:46,455 --> 01:03:48,188
現在不是時候
This ain't the time

1740
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:49,623
現在，你們把它拉在一起
Now, y'all pull it together

1741
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:50,925
我們很好
We are fine

1742
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:52,292
我們...我們沒事
We-we... we are okay

1743
01:03:52,294 --> 01:03:53,728
屋頂。我們去屋頂吧
The roof. Let's hit the roof

1744
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:55,295
好吧，當我在這裡上學的時候，
Okay, when I went to school here,

1745
01:03:55,297 --> 01:03:56,496
這就是我們離開學校的原因
that's how we got out of school

1746
01:03:56,498 --> 01:03:58,698
然後我們會跳到小學屋頂上
And then we would jump onto the elementary school roof

1747
01:03:58,700 --> 01:03:59,635
來吧！
Come on!

1748
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,238
移動它，移動它！這是個壞主意
Move it, move it! This is a bad idea

1749
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:06,339
來吧！這是個壞主意！
Come on! This is a bad idea!

1750
01:04:06,341 --> 01:04:08,241
小心，小心，哇，哇！
Watch it, watch it Whoa, whoa!

1751
01:04:08,243 --> 01:04:09,843
哇，哇！哇！
Whoa, whoa! Whoa!

1752
01:04:09,845 --> 01:04:11,277
哇，哇，哇，哇，哇，哇
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Whoa

1753
01:04:11,279 --> 01:04:12,479
哦，我的上帝，哇，哇！
Oh, my God Whoa, whoa!

1754
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:13,713
好，退後
Okay, back up

1755
01:04:13,715 --> 01:04:15,215
聽我說，來吧！
Listen to me Come on!

1756
01:04:15,217 --> 01:04:16,784
向你發誓，當我在這裡上學的時候，
Swear to you, when I went to school here,

1757
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:18,351
那一跳似乎沒有那麼高
that jump did not seem that high

1758
01:04:18,353 --> 01:04:19,719
我不可能做到這一點
There's no way I can make that

1759
01:04:19,721 --> 01:04:21,855
我能跳三英尺，膝蓋和背部
I can jump like three feet My knees and my back

1760
01:04:21,857 --> 01:04:23,923
都是從移動的盒子裡拍出來的，泰迪！
are totally shot from moving boxes, Teddy!

1761
01:04:23,925 --> 01:04:25,224
好吧，我們該怎麼辦？
All right What are we gonna do?

1762
01:04:25,226 --> 01:04:26,225
我們該怎麼辦？聽著，聽著
What are we gonna do? Listen, listen

1763
01:04:26,227 --> 01:04:27,360
我拿到了
I got it

1764
01:04:27,362 --> 01:04:28,728
假設它有15英尺高
Let's just say it's 15 feet

1765
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:29,864
哦，上帝
Oh, God

1766
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,364
走15英尺，
Take that 15 feet,

1767
01:04:31,366 --> 01:04:33,233
減去你能跳的三英尺
minus the three feet that you can jump

1768
01:04:33,235 --> 01:04:34,467
你在說什麼？
What are you talking about?

1769
01:04:34,469 --> 01:04:36,736
我們所要做的就是使用畢達哥拉斯定理
All we gotta do is use the Pythagorean theorem

1770
01:04:36,738 --> 01:04:37,704
課堂上沒人在聽
Nobody was listening in class

1771
01:04:37,706 --> 01:04:39,539
沒人知道怎麼做哦，我的上帝
Nobody knows how to do that Oh, my God

1772
01:04:39,541 --> 01:04:40,774
不，等等，等等，嘉莉說...嘉莉說，
No, wait, wait, wait Carrie said... Carrie said,

1773
01:04:40,776 --> 01:04:41,976
為了完成畢達哥拉斯定理，
in order to do the Pythagorean theorem,

1774
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:43,743
你必須知道斜邊
you-you have to know the hypotenuse

1775
01:04:43,745 --> 01:04:46,346
我們所要做的就是降低血壓
All we gotta do is hypotenuse it

1776
01:04:46,348 --> 01:04:47,947
A平方加B平方等於C平方
A-squared plus B-squared equals C-squared

1777
01:04:47,949 --> 01:04:49,716
如果你知道...知道兩面，
If you know... know two sides,

1778
01:04:49,718 --> 01:04:51,018
那會幫助你找到第三個，
then that'll help you figure out the third,

1779
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:52,686
所以大約有六英尺寬，
so it's roughly six feet across,

1780
01:04:52,688 --> 01:04:55,388
15平方是225除以6平方
and 15-squared is 225 divided by six-squared

1781
01:04:55,390 --> 01:04:56,890
斜邊！等等，我剛才說了什麼？
Hypotenuse it! Wait, what did I just say?

1782
01:04:56,892 --> 01:04:58,357
是36歲，是的，36歲
It's 36 Yeah, 36

1783
01:04:58,359 --> 01:04:59,726
但是你沒有分割它，你添加它
But you don't divide it You add it

1784
01:04:59,728 --> 01:05:01,360
那麼，我剛才說了什麼？呃...呃
So, what did I just say? The, um... the, uh

1785
01:05:01,362 --> 01:05:02,594
她是數學最好的。等等，不，呃
She's the best one at math Wait, no, uh

1786
01:05:02,596 --> 01:05:03,797
斜邊！不，不，你可以這樣做
Hypotenuse it! No, no, you can do this

1787
01:05:03,799 --> 01:05:05,865
那麼，乘以6平方...我不知道不
By six-squared, then... I-I don't know No

1788
01:05:05,867 --> 01:05:07,333
不，來吧。你有這個嗎
No, come on. You got this

1789
01:05:08,804 --> 01:05:10,402
哦，我的上帝！
Oh, my God!

1790
01:05:10,404 --> 01:05:12,538
米拉！哦，我的上帝！
Mila! Oh, my God!

1791
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:14,607
哦！
Oh!

1792
01:05:14,609 --> 01:05:15,642
你沒事吧？夥計們！
You all right? Guys!

1793
01:05:15,644 --> 01:05:17,410
這不是一個難的數學問題
It's not a hard math problem

1794
01:05:17,412 --> 01:05:18,745
這是一個簡單的物理問題
It's a simple physics problem

1795
01:05:18,747 --> 01:05:19,946
跳
Just jump

1796
01:05:19,948 --> 01:05:21,981
你斜邊了嗎？
Did you did you hypotenuse it?

1797
01:05:21,983 --> 01:05:23,717
是的，我斜邊了
Yeah, I hypotenused it

1798
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:25,350
你能跳下去嗎？
Can you just jump?

1799
01:05:25,352 --> 01:05:26,853
麥克，你是下一個
Mac, you're up next

1800
01:05:26,855 --> 01:05:28,521
不，不，是的
No. No Yes

1801
01:05:28,523 --> 01:05:30,390
麥克，你不要給我那個，好嗎？
Mac, don't you give me that, okay?

1802
01:05:30,392 --> 01:05:31,958
當我想到男人，我想到你
When I think man, I think you

1803
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:35,327
我想小麥克一定有多驕傲
I think about how proud Little Mac must be

1804
01:05:35,329 --> 01:05:37,030
我要你做你最擅長的事情
I want you to do what you do best

1805
01:05:37,032 --> 01:05:38,363
然後變得偉大
and go be great

1806
01:05:38,365 --> 01:05:40,633
好吧。是
Okay. Yeah

1807
01:05:40,635 --> 01:05:42,435
穿過屋頂，麥克
Get across that roof, Mac

1808
01:05:42,437 --> 01:05:43,670
是啊！好吧！好嗎？
Yeah! Okay! All right?

1809
01:05:43,672 --> 01:05:44,871
好吧，你明白了
All right You got this

1810
01:05:44,873 --> 01:05:47,040
麥克進來了！退後！
Mac coming in! Step back!

1811
01:05:47,042 --> 01:05:48,875
走吧，麥克，謝謝你，泰迪
Let's go, Mac Thank you, Teddy

1812
01:05:48,877 --> 01:05:50,844
隨時
Any time

1813
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:52,312
麥克攻擊！
Mac attack!

1814
01:05:54,015 --> 01:05:55,314
麥克攻擊！
Mac attack!

1815
01:05:55,316 --> 01:05:57,316
孤獨之心的主人
Owner of a lonely heart

1816
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:06,226
媽的！
Shit!

1817
01:06:07,896 --> 01:06:09,095
哦，上帝！
Oh, God!

1818
01:06:09,097 --> 01:06:10,496
哦，泰迪！
Oh, Teddy!

1819
01:06:10,498 --> 01:06:12,598
哦，我為什麼要聽你的？欺騙
Oh, why'd I listen to you? Shit

1820
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,032
你太有說服力了！
You were so convincing!

1821
01:06:14,034 --> 01:06:16,402
對不起，夥計嘿
I'm sorry, buddy Hey

1822
01:06:16,404 --> 01:06:17,937
我的手臂有點刺痛
My arm's kind of tingly

1823
01:06:17,939 --> 01:06:19,906
我想我可能傷害了它
I think I might have hurt it

1824
01:06:19,908 --> 01:06:21,573
感覺很奇怪，夥計
Feels weird, man

1825
01:06:21,575 --> 01:06:23,344
他該死的肩膀在嘴裡
His damn shoulder is in his mouth

1826
01:06:29,618 --> 01:06:30,683
哦！
Oh!

1827
01:06:30,685 --> 01:06:32,051
嘿
Hey

1828
01:06:32,053 --> 01:06:33,819
巨無霸，夥計，對此我很抱歉
Big Mac, man, I'm sorry about that

1829
01:06:33,821 --> 01:06:36,922
那只熱雞，有點倒帶，夥計
That hot chicken, it just kind of got on rewind, man

1830
01:06:36,924 --> 01:06:38,625
要麼是後面，要麼是前面，
It was either the back or the front,

1831
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:40,593
我剛買了這條褲子，fam
and I just got these pants, fam

1832
01:06:40,595 --> 01:06:43,765
哦，上帝，我度過了最糟糕的夜晚！
Oh, God, I'm having the worst night!

1833
01:07:01,916 --> 01:07:04,416
你好，泰迪
Hello, Teddy

1834
01:07:04,418 --> 01:07:05,854
嗯？
Huh?

1835
01:07:08,389 --> 01:07:09,922
嘿，寶貝
Hey, babe

1836
01:07:09,924 --> 01:07:12,424
你不需要嘿，寶貝我
You don't need to hey, babe me

1837
01:07:15,664 --> 01:07:17,464
我知道發生了什麼
I know what's going on

1838
01:07:19,533 --> 01:07:20,467
什麼，呃，嗯
What's, uh, um

1839
01:07:21,569 --> 01:07:22,570
怎麼回事？
What's going on?

1840
01:07:24,104 --> 01:07:25,904
深夜？
The late hours?

1841
01:07:25,906 --> 01:07:27,408
秘密？
The secrecy?

1842
01:07:28,742 --> 01:07:30,176
承認吧，泰迪
Just admit it, Teddy

1843
01:07:30,178 --> 01:07:31,810
承認什麼？
Just admit what?

1844
01:07:31,812 --> 01:07:32,947
這很明顯
It's so obvious

1845
01:07:35,082 --> 01:07:36,650
你越來越冷了
You're getting cold feet

1846
01:07:43,557 --> 01:07:45,593
是啊！
Yeah!

1847
01:07:46,694 --> 01:07:47,993
冷腳？
Cold feet?

1848
01:07:47,995 --> 01:07:50,864
自從你求婚後，你就不再是你自己了
Ever since you proposed, you haven't been yourself

1849
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:52,497
冷腳？
Cold feet?

1850
01:07:52,499 --> 01:07:56,935
麗莎，我不會退縮
Lisa, I am not getting cold feet

1851
01:07:56,937 --> 01:07:59,671
事實上，這是完全相反的
In fact, it's the it's the complete opposite

1852
01:07:59,673 --> 01:08:01,006
我的腳很暖和
My feet are very warm

1853
01:08:01,008 --> 01:08:02,942
我想要這個
I want this

1854
01:08:02,944 --> 01:08:04,443
我道歉
And I apologize

1855
01:08:04,445 --> 01:08:05,911
如果事情是這樣，我道歉
I apologize if things have been

1856
01:08:05,913 --> 01:08:08,447
最近有點瘋狂，但是，寶貝，
a little crazy as of late, but, babe,

1857
01:08:08,449 --> 01:08:10,148
你必須知道我在外面
you gotta know that I am out here

1858
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:12,117
我......我在努力
I'm-I'm... I'm trying

1859
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:16,655
好嗎？我每天晚上都在拚命工作，
Okay? I am busting my ass every day, every night,

1860
01:08:16,657 --> 01:08:18,191
對我們來說
for us

1861
01:08:18,193 --> 01:08:20,158
為了我和你
For me and you

1862
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:22,027
我在外面的另一個世界，寶貝
I'm in a different world out there, babe

1863
01:08:22,029 --> 01:08:24,796
這個世界讓我很緊張
And this world is stressing me out

1864
01:08:24,798 --> 01:08:28,734
這讓我很緊張
It is stressing me out

1865
01:08:29,937 --> 01:08:31,603
對不起，我懷疑你
I'm sorry I doubted you

1866
01:08:31,605 --> 01:08:34,006
我知道這種職業變化很大
I-I know this career change has been a lot

1867
01:08:34,008 --> 01:08:36,041
太多了
It's a lot

1868
01:08:36,043 --> 01:08:38,744
太多了
It's so much

1869
01:08:38,746 --> 01:08:41,046
太多了
It's so, so much

1870
01:08:41,048 --> 01:08:42,883
可憐的孩子
Poor baby

1871
01:08:47,154 --> 01:08:48,454
我愛你哦
I love you Oh

1872
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:54,862
我也愛你
I love you, too

1873
01:08:57,698 --> 01:08:59,264
這能完成你的訂單嗎？
Does that complete your order?

1874
01:08:59,266 --> 01:09:01,066
哦，等等，等等
Oh, wait, h-hold up

1875
01:09:01,068 --> 01:09:02,267
我不想要那個蘋果派是的，我不能...對不起
I don't want that apple pie Yeah, I can't... I'm sorry

1876
01:09:02,269 --> 01:09:03,635
很難聽到你的聲音
It's-it's kind of hard to hear you

1877
01:09:03,637 --> 01:09:04,770
背景中有一個嬰兒
There's a baby in the background

1878
01:09:04,772 --> 01:09:06,138
寶貝，我說安靜點坐下！
Baby, I said be quiet Sit down!

1879
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,739
是啊，說——再給我說一遍
Yeah, say-say it one more time for me

1880
01:09:07,741 --> 01:09:09,207
說吧...再說一遍，那漢堡好吃嗎？
Say it... say it again Is that burger good or what?

1881
01:09:09,209 --> 01:09:11,076
有什麼辦法能讓你尊敬我嗎
Is there any way I can get you to respectfully

1882
01:09:11,078 --> 01:09:12,677
把孩子關起來？你說什麼？
shut that baby up? What'd you say?

1883
01:09:12,679 --> 01:09:14,846
把車開到窗戶邊去吧，為了愛情見鬼去吧！
Just pull up to the window, for the love Heck no!

1884
01:09:14,848 --> 01:09:16,615
哦。欺騙
Oh. Shit

1885
01:09:16,617 --> 01:09:17,883
媽的，行不通
Shit It won't work

1886
01:09:17,885 --> 01:09:19,084
我看到你了，泰迪
I see you, Teddy

1887
01:09:19,086 --> 01:09:20,584
它不起作用了
It's not working

1888
01:09:20,586 --> 01:09:23,654
汽水機後面的泰迪·沃克
Teddy Walker behind the soda machine

1889
01:09:23,656 --> 01:09:24,989
喂？欺騙
Hello? Shit

1890
01:09:24,991 --> 01:09:27,526
我看見你在看泰迪·沃克
Teddy Walker I see you looking at

1891
01:09:27,528 --> 01:09:28,593
我們正在進行眼神交流
We're making eye contact right now

1892
01:09:28,595 --> 01:09:30,262
睜開你的眼睛，泰迪
Open your eyes, Teddy

1893
01:09:30,264 --> 01:09:32,697
泰迪，過來！斯圖爾特
Teddy, come here! Stewart

1894
01:09:32,699 --> 01:09:33,932
嘿
Hey

1895
01:09:33,934 --> 01:09:35,067
斯圖爾特，你是說泰迪？
Stewart, you were saying Teddy?

1896
01:09:35,069 --> 01:09:36,268
大約十倍
About ten times

1897
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:37,635
嘿嘿
Hey Hey

1898
01:09:37,637 --> 01:09:38,637
幫我個忙
Do me a favor Yep

1899
01:09:38,639 --> 01:09:40,539
呃，去那邊處理這個情況
Uh, go over there and handle that situation

1900
01:09:40,541 --> 01:09:41,472
在免下車的地方
at the drive-through Uh-huh

1901
01:09:41,474 --> 01:09:42,975
之後我會告訴你該怎麼做，
And I'll tell you what to do after that,

1902
01:09:42,977 --> 01:09:44,042
因為我負責
because I'm in charge

1903
01:09:44,044 --> 01:09:45,743
嘿，你好？
Hey, so Hello?

1904
01:09:45,745 --> 01:09:47,545
給我一秒鐘。女士
Give me a second. M-Ma'am

1905
01:09:47,547 --> 01:09:49,013
我說過我不想要餡餅好吧，女士，女士
I said I didn't want the pie Okay, ma'am, ma

1906
01:09:49,015 --> 01:09:49,947
她不想要餡餅
She don't want the pie Uh-uh

1907
01:09:49,949 --> 01:09:51,850
把餡餅拿開她想拿
Take the pie off She want to get the

1908
01:09:51,852 --> 01:09:53,151
我說過我不會得到餡餅
I said I ain't getting a pie

1909
01:09:53,153 --> 01:09:54,219
拉上來！你聽到了嗎
Pull up! You heard me

1910
01:09:54,221 --> 01:09:55,686
把車開到窗戶邊！好
Pull up to the window! All right

1911
01:09:55,688 --> 01:09:57,022
當她停下來的時候，告訴我，
When she pull up, tell me,

1912
01:09:57,024 --> 01:09:58,956
因為我要來打孩子的臉
cause I'm gonna come punch the baby in the face

1913
01:09:58,958 --> 01:10:01,125
上帝看不到一切，只要讓我知道
God don't see everything Just let me know

1914
01:10:01,127 --> 01:10:05,063
嘿，跟我說話，你好嗎？
Hey, talk to me, man How you doing?

1915
01:10:05,065 --> 01:10:07,065
你知道，我以為是伍德布裡奇朋克
You know, I thought it was the Woodbridge punks

1916
01:10:07,067 --> 01:10:09,800
闖入學校，但現在一切都有意義了
that broke into the school, but now it all makes sense

1917
01:10:09,802 --> 01:10:12,903
我找到了這個
I found this

1918
01:10:12,905 --> 01:10:14,508
在犯罪現場
at the scene of the crime

1919
01:10:15,876 --> 01:10:17,242
那麼，你做了什麼，嗯？
So, what'd you do, huh?

1920
01:10:17,244 --> 01:10:18,310
闖入我的電腦？
Break into my computer?

1921
01:10:18,312 --> 01:10:20,145
偷期中考試？
Steal the midterm?

1922
01:10:20,147 --> 01:10:21,712
有點偏執吧，斯圖？
Being a little paranoid, aren't we, Stew?

1923
01:10:21,714 --> 01:10:23,315
我是嗎？斯圖爾特，那是一個塑料袋
Am I? Stewart, that's a plastic bag

1924
01:10:23,317 --> 01:10:25,649
裡面有雞皮，上面有證據
with a chicken wrapper in it with the word evidence

1925
01:10:25,651 --> 01:10:28,053
寫在上面，這可能是你的筆跡
written on it, which is probably in your handwriting

1926
01:10:28,055 --> 01:10:31,123
這不是一把冒煙的槍，斯圖
It's not exactly a smoking gun, Stew

1927
01:10:31,125 --> 01:10:33,158
這只是巧合，對吧？
It's just a coincidence, right?

1928
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,259
或許
Probably

1929
01:10:34,261 --> 01:10:36,027
如果你偷了那個測試，
If you stole that test,

1930
01:10:36,029 --> 01:10:37,862
我會發現的，泰迪
I will find out, Teddy

1931
01:10:37,864 --> 01:10:40,832
我是一個誠實的人，努力過著誠實的生活
I'm an honest man trying to make an honest living

1932
01:10:40,834 --> 01:10:43,667
泰迪·沃克不作弊
Teddy Walker does not cheat

1933
01:10:43,669 --> 01:10:45,071
你作弊
You cheated

1934
01:10:46,973 --> 01:10:48,973
你們每一個人
Every last one of you

1935
01:10:48,975 --> 01:10:50,742
欺騙
cheated

1936
01:10:50,744 --> 01:10:52,877
呃...驚歎聲
Uh... whoa

1937
01:10:52,879 --> 01:10:55,247
凱莉，這些都是非常強烈的指控
Carrie, those are very strong accusations

1938
01:10:55,249 --> 01:10:57,382
真的。比如，什麼？
For real. Like, what?

1939
01:10:57,384 --> 01:10:58,749
我被冒犯了
I'm offended

1940
01:10:58,751 --> 01:11:00,918
好吧，我會記下來的，泰迪
Well, I'll take note of that, Teddy

1941
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:03,088
你們誰想承認呢？
Which one of you want to own up to it?

1942
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:04,755
我也很生氣
I'm offended, too

1943
01:11:04,757 --> 01:11:06,191
鮑比？
Bobby?

1944
01:11:06,193 --> 01:11:07,625
你是罪犯
You a criminal

1945
01:11:07,627 --> 01:11:08,726
你顯然不擅長
You obviously not good at it

1946
01:11:08,728 --> 01:11:10,027
這就是你進監獄的原因
That's why you in jail

1947
01:11:10,029 --> 01:11:11,996
這一切都是你策劃的嗎？
Did you orchestrate this whole thing?

1948
01:11:11,998 --> 01:11:14,732
我的意思是，你為什麼要挑我的毛病，描述我？
I mean, why you gonna pick on me and profile me?

1949
01:11:14,734 --> 01:11:16,734
我是唯一一個被鎖在這裡的人
I'm the only one locked up here

1950
01:11:16,736 --> 01:11:18,836
所以，如果我被鎖在這裡，
So, if I'm locked up in here,

1951
01:11:18,838 --> 01:11:21,372
我怎麼能在外面偷考試呢，嘉莉小姐？
how can I be out there stealing the test, Miss Carrie?

1952
01:11:21,374 --> 01:11:23,074
哦，哦，等等
Oh, oh, wait a minute

1953
01:11:23,076 --> 01:11:24,108
你們都偷了考試？
Y'all stole the test?

1954
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:25,209
我沒說什麼
I'm not saying nothing

1955
01:11:25,211 --> 01:11:26,311
我什麼都不知道
I don't know nothing

1956
01:11:26,313 --> 01:11:27,845
我什麼都不知道
I don't know shit

1957
01:11:27,847 --> 01:11:29,046
因為我什麼也沒說
Cause I never said nothing

1958
01:11:29,048 --> 01:11:30,648
關於有人偷考試的事
about anybody stealing the test

1959
01:11:30,650 --> 01:11:32,983
我們就要瞭解真相了
We're about to get to the truth

1960
01:11:32,985 --> 01:11:34,952
誰偷了考試？
Who stole the test?

1961
01:11:34,954 --> 01:11:36,719
麥克？
Mac?

1962
01:11:36,721 --> 01:11:40,024
你想向我解釋一下你是如何得到滿分的？
You want to explain to me how you got a perfect score?

1963
01:11:40,026 --> 01:11:41,426
事情是這樣的，好嗎？
Here's the thing, all right?

1964
01:11:41,428 --> 01:11:44,261
我知道我沒有得到滿分，
I know I didn't get a perfect score,

1965
01:11:44,263 --> 01:11:45,729
因為我故意錯過了一些
because I missed a few on purpose

1966
01:11:45,731 --> 01:11:46,730
哦，軟糖
Oh, fudge

1967
01:11:48,367 --> 01:11:50,335
謝謝你！
Thank you!

1968
01:11:50,337 --> 01:11:51,869
你是告密者，麥克
You's a snitch, Mac

1969
01:11:51,871 --> 01:11:53,438
告密者是婊子
Snitches are bitches

1970
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,806
我不喜歡騙子
I don't like cheaters

1971
01:11:55,808 --> 01:11:59,944
我討厭我教一個滿是騙子的房間
And I hate that I am teaching a room full of cheaters

1972
01:11:59,946 --> 01:12:02,179
我不喜歡騙子
I don't like men that cheat

1973
01:12:02,181 --> 01:12:03,814
我不喜歡欺騙的女人
I don't like women that cheat

1974
01:12:03,816 --> 01:12:05,116
我甚至不跟政客打交道
I don't even deal with politicians

1975
01:12:05,118 --> 01:12:07,151
你知道為什麼嗎？因為他們都是騙子
You know why? Cause they all cheaters

1976
01:12:07,153 --> 01:12:08,786
我甚至不吃奇多
I don't even eat Cheetos

1977
01:12:08,788 --> 01:12:10,687
你知道為什麼嗎？因為聽起來像騙子。
You know why? 'Cause it sound like cheaters.

1978
01:12:10,689 --> 01:12:13,090
再加上奇托灰塵會給你特朗普的顏色
Plus that Cheeto dust will give you that Trump color

1979
01:12:13,092 --> 01:12:15,159
是啊，很難得到奇多灰塵
Yeah It's hard to get that Cheeto dust

1980
01:12:15,161 --> 01:12:17,027
放開你的手
off your hands

1981
01:12:17,029 --> 01:12:18,896
這會毀了你的女兒
It'll mess up your Girbauds

1982
01:12:18,898 --> 01:12:20,798
你知道，我起初喜歡你
You know, I liked you at first

1983
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,133
你們都完了
I'm done with all of y'all

1984
01:12:22,135 --> 01:12:24,068
你們都可以從我的課上起床
All of y'all can get up out my class

1985
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:25,402
我和你們都玩完了什麼？
I'm done with y'all What?

1986
01:12:25,404 --> 01:12:27,204
好吧，凱莉，讓我說點什麼
Okay, Carrie, let me I want to say something

1987
01:12:27,206 --> 01:12:29,206
我的GED呢？他將從高中退學
What about my GED? He's gonna drop out of high school

1988
01:12:29,208 --> 01:12:31,408
如果我得不到GED，我就要坐牢
If I don't get my GED, I'm going to prison

1989
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:32,810
我需要這個GED
I need this GED

1990
01:12:32,812 --> 01:12:33,978
你需要把你的戰利品關起來
You need to keep your booty closed

1991
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:35,446
這就是你在監獄裡需要做的
That's what you need to do You in jail

1992
01:12:35,448 --> 01:12:36,980
不，我需要這個GED
No, I need this GED

1993
01:12:36,982 --> 01:12:38,181
我們不能靠蘭迪的工資生活
We can't live on Randy's salary

1994
01:12:38,183 --> 01:12:39,417
請不要讓我回家
Please don't make me go home

1995
01:12:39,419 --> 01:12:40,753
我討厭我的孩子
I hate my kids

1996
01:12:41,821 --> 01:12:44,288
但是我喜歡當媽媽
But I love being a mom

1997
01:12:44,290 --> 01:12:46,756
我很幸運。我真幸運
I'm blessed. I'm so blessed

1998
01:12:46,758 --> 01:12:48,392
凱莉，拜託
Carrie, please

1999
01:12:48,394 --> 01:12:50,059
我不能活一輩子
I cannot live a lifetime

2000
01:12:50,061 --> 01:12:52,129
開著花冠在醉鬼周圍兜風
of driving around drunks in a Corolla

2001
01:12:52,131 --> 01:12:53,497
聽著，我最不想做的事
Look, the last thing I want to do

2002
01:12:53,499 --> 01:12:55,232
正在貝斯特韋斯特酒店打掃房間
is be cleaning the rooms at the Best Western

2003
01:12:55,234 --> 01:12:56,433
好嗎？因為這一切
Okay? 'Cause all that

2004
01:12:56,435 --> 01:12:57,901
尤其是短期房間，
Especially them short-stay rooms,

2005
01:12:57,903 --> 01:12:59,470
因為你知道那是什麼，對吧？
cause you know what that is, right?

2006
01:12:59,472 --> 01:13:01,505
那只是會用到避孕套，髒床單
That's just gonna be used condoms, soiled sheets

2007
01:13:01,507 --> 01:13:03,376
那不是你在哪裡遇到你的賤女人的地方嗎？
Ain't that where you met your bottom bitch at?

2008
01:13:05,778 --> 01:13:07,744
你認識屈麗娜？
You know Trina?

2009
01:13:07,746 --> 01:13:08,978
嗯
Mm-hmm

她屁股也很胖
She got a fat ass, too

2011
01:13:10,416 --> 01:13:13,283
你知道嗎？你們都有一些傷感的故事，
You know what? All of you got little sob stories,

2012
01:13:13,285 --> 01:13:14,985
但是你們都應該想到這一點
but y'all should've thought about that

2013
01:13:14,987 --> 01:13:16,989
在你去偷考試之前
before you went and stole the test

2014
01:13:19,258 --> 01:13:21,125
滾出我的課堂
Just get the hell up out of my class

2015
01:13:24,763 --> 01:13:27,064
這不是悲傷的故事。不！
It's not sob stories. No!

2016
01:13:27,066 --> 01:13:28,499
我...我是那個想讓我的生活變得和諧的人
I'm-I'm the one who wants to get my life together

2017
01:13:28,501 --> 01:13:30,267
讓我給你講講傑伊
Let-let-let me tell you something about Jay

是我
It was me

2023
01:13:42,281 --> 01:13:44,181
不應該生他們的氣
Shouldn't be mad at none of them

2024
01:13:44,183 --> 01:13:45,982
我的意思是，是的，他們看了答案，
I mean, yeah, they looked at the answers,

2025
01:13:45,984 --> 01:13:47,953
但是如果我沒有把它放在他們的腿上，他們就不會有
but they wouldn't have if I hadn't put it on their lap

2026
01:13:49,354 --> 01:13:51,222
我要為這一切負責
I take responsibility for it all

2027

我是策劃整件事的主謀

2028
01:13:53,226 --> 01:13:54,227
都是我

2029
01:13:55,328 --> 01:13:56,826
謝謝你
Thank you

2030
01:13:56,828 --> 01:13:58,562
謝謝你，泰迪
Thank you, Teddy

2031
01:13:58,564 --> 01:14:00,897
我欣賞你的誠實
I appreciate your honesty

2032
01:14:00,899 --> 01:14:02,866
我只是想做正確的事，嘉莉
I'm just trying to do what's right, Carrie

2033
01:14:02,868 --> 01:14:05,069
現在你可以離開我的班級了
Now you can get the hell out of my class

2034
01:14:05,071 --> 01:14:07,003
嗯？
Huh?

2035
01:14:07,005 --> 01:14:08,938
上路吧，傑克
Hit the road, Jack

2036
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:12,041
不要讓門把手打到上帝劈開你的地方
Don't let the doorknob hit you where the good Lord split you

2037
01:14:12,043 --> 01:14:13,543
我想當我說這些話時，
I thought that when I said all that stuff,

2038
01:14:13,545 --> 01:14:14,945
你會聽的
that you would listen to it

2039
01:14:14,947 --> 01:14:16,113
不，不，不，不，不，不，不，不，不
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

2040
01:14:16,115 --> 01:14:17,414
你在這裡沒有第二次機會了
You gets no second chances up in here

2041
01:14:17,416 --> 01:14:18,582
不再和我在一起了
Not with me no more

2042
01:14:18,584 --> 01:14:20,417
呃。我不再支持你了
Uh-uh. I ain't got your back no more

2043
01:14:20,419 --> 01:14:22,852
你甚至不想在這裡我真的想在這裡
You don't even want to be here I do want to be here

2044
01:14:22,854 --> 01:14:24,187
泰迪，你甚至不想在這裡
You don't even want to be here, Teddy

2045
01:14:24,189 --> 01:14:26,223
不，至於你們其他人，
No And as for the rest of you,

2046
01:14:26,225 --> 01:14:27,924
我想讓你長時間的努力思考
I want you to think long and hard

2047
01:14:27,926 --> 01:14:30,394
如果你真的想要這個
about if you really want this

2048
01:14:32,130 --> 01:14:34,199
下課
Class dismissed

2049
01:14:36,968 --> 01:14:38,369
找到解決方案...
Find a solution for the...

2050
01:14:38,371 --> 01:14:40,069
我什麼都不知道
I don't know none of this shit

2051
01:14:40,071 --> 01:14:41,070
我需要你
I need you

2052
01:14:41,072 --> 01:14:44,474
我需要你的幫助把手放下
I need your help Put your damn hand down

2053
01:14:44,476 --> 01:14:46,276
我要在彩虹關閉前去
I'm going to Rainbows before they close

2054
01:14:46,278 --> 01:14:48,444
這是情感購物，嘉莉
That's emotional shopping, Carrie

2055
01:14:48,446 --> 01:14:50,147
這是彩虹，混蛋
It's Rainbows, motherfucker

2056
01:14:50,149 --> 01:14:51,417
狗屎很便宜
Shit is cheap

2057
01:14:56,054 --> 01:14:58,421
泰迪，泰迪，泰迪
Teddy, Teddy, Teddy

2058
01:14:58,423 --> 01:15:00,922
你真蠢
You are stupid

2059
01:15:00,924 --> 01:15:03,960
直到你承認，她才知道發生了什麼
She didn't know what was going on until you admitted it

2060
01:15:03,962 --> 01:15:05,396
我們讓她一直到最後，
We had her right up till the end,

2061
01:15:05,398 --> 01:15:08,431
然後是泰迪，舊磚頭
and then Teddy, old brick head

2062
01:15:08,433 --> 01:15:10,900
哦，泰迪！
Oh, Teddy!

2063
01:15:10,902 --> 01:15:12,368
你活該
You deserved that

2064
01:15:12,370 --> 01:15:14,571
學校？
A school?

2065
01:15:14,573 --> 01:15:17,574
我們從未接受過這樣的項目
We've never taken on a project like that

2066
01:15:17,576 --> 01:15:20,510
嗯，我是一個開箱即用的思想家
Well, I am an outside-of-the-box thinker

2067
01:15:20,512 --> 01:15:22,278
這就是我
That's just who I am

2068
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:23,646
我認為如果學生很興奮
I think that if students are excited

2069
01:15:23,648 --> 01:15:25,148
關於他們的環境，
about their environment,

2070
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:27,083
他們會對學習感到興奮
they'll be excited about learning

2071
01:15:27,085 --> 01:15:28,284
這完全有道理
That makes total sense

2072
01:15:28,286 --> 01:15:29,653
我知道我會的
I know I would

2073
01:15:29,655 --> 01:15:31,120
我很高興聽到這個消息
Well, I'm glad to hear it

2074
01:15:31,122 --> 01:15:32,455
如果你感興趣，我願意給你
If you're interested, I'd love to give you

2075
01:15:32,457 --> 01:15:33,956
參觀學校
a tour of the school

2076
01:15:33,958 --> 01:15:35,558
你可以隨時來，或者你知道，
You could come by any day, or you know what,

2077
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:37,125
你甚至可以放學後來
you could even come after school

2078
01:15:37,127 --> 01:15:40,098
我們還有幾個夜間節目
We have several night programs as well

2079
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:44,334
嘿嘿
Hey Hey

2080
01:15:44,336 --> 01:15:46,402
好，給我看看你有什麼
Okay, show me what you got

2081
01:15:46,404 --> 01:15:48,003
給我看看你有什麼！
Show me what you got!

2082
01:15:48,005 --> 01:15:50,206
你有什麼給我的？開始
What you got for me? Come on

2083
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:52,141
點燃。你有什麼？
Light up. What you got?

2084
01:15:52,143 --> 01:15:54,043
哦，你殺了我！
Oh, you killing me!

2085
01:15:54,045 --> 01:15:55,578
你贏了。恭喜
You won. Congratulations

2086
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:57,547
我為你感到驕傲，boo
I'm proud of you, boo

2087
01:15:57,549 --> 01:15:59,515
現在，你打敗你的老師並不酷
Now, it's not cool that you beat your teacher

2088
01:15:59,517 --> 01:16:01,517
在德克薩斯舉行，但我喜歡這種方式
at Texas hold 'em, but I like the way

2089
01:16:01,519 --> 01:16:04,020
你把計算結果釘在了底池賠率上，
you nailed down the calculations on the pot odds,

2090
01:16:04,022 --> 01:16:06,255
所以我讓這張幻燈片
so I'm gonna let this slide

2091
01:16:06,257 --> 01:16:08,291
現在，記住我說過的話
Now, remember what I said

2092
01:16:08,293 --> 01:16:11,093
沒有捷徑可走，你必須全力以赴
There are no shortcuts You gotta work your butt off

2093
01:16:11,095 --> 01:16:13,128
好嗎？給我一些愛
Okay? Give me some love

2094
01:16:13,130 --> 01:16:15,465
嗯。真為你驕傲
Mmm. So proud of you

2095
01:16:15,467 --> 01:16:17,200
繼續，祝你今天愉快
Go on and have a good day, now

2096
01:16:17,202 --> 01:16:19,237
也許有一天，我會帶你去拉斯維加斯
Maybe one day, I'll take you to Vegas

2097
01:16:26,311 --> 01:16:27,512
很酷
That was cool

2098
01:16:29,347 --> 01:16:32,047
你知道，呃，這曾經是特殊的ed教室
You know, uh, this used to be the special ed classroom

2099
01:16:32,049 --> 01:16:33,316
當我來到這裡
when I went here

2100
01:16:33,318 --> 01:16:34,950
它仍然是
It still is

2101
01:16:34,952 --> 01:16:36,686
你教特殊教育？
You teach special ed?

2102
01:16:36,688 --> 01:16:40,390
特殊教育是我的一部分
Special ed is one of my sections

2103
01:16:40,392 --> 01:16:42,926
事實上，這是我的最愛之一
It's one of my favorites, actually

2104
01:16:44,729 --> 01:16:48,296
你知道，那孩子讓我想起了我自己
You know, that kid reminds me a lot of myself

2105
01:16:48,298 --> 01:16:49,699
我根本不會做數學
I couldn't do math for shit

2106
01:16:49,701 --> 01:16:51,401
當我在學校的時候
when I was in school

2107
01:16:51,403 --> 01:16:53,436
不同的是我沒有像你這樣的老師
Difference is I didn't have a teacher like you

2108
01:16:53,438 --> 01:16:55,671
願意留下來幫我的人
that was willing to stay behind and help me

2109
01:16:55,673 --> 01:16:57,473
我知道你在做什麼，泰迪
I know what you're doing, Teddy

2110
01:16:57,475 --> 01:17:01,009
我承認你很酷
And I admit it was very cool of you

2111
01:17:01,011 --> 01:17:03,379
為你的同學承擔秋天的責任，
to take the fall for your classmates,

2112
01:17:03,381 --> 01:17:04,580
但是你是個騙子
but you're a hustler

2113
01:17:04,582 --> 01:17:07,350
試著不做工作就溜過去
Trying to skate by without doing the work

2114
01:17:07,352 --> 01:17:09,151
你應該知道你不能逼我
You should know you can't hustle me

2115
01:17:09,153 --> 01:17:10,152
我願意
I do

2116
01:17:10,154 --> 01:17:12,688
好嗎？我知道
Okay? I-I do know that

2117
01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:14,991
我向你保證，我完了
And I promise you I'm done

2118
01:17:14,993 --> 01:17:16,526
我不要再忙碌了
I'm not hustling no more

2119
01:17:16,528 --> 01:17:19,529
夜校是第二次機會
Night school is about second chances

2120
01:17:19,531 --> 01:17:21,329
如果我沒有第二次機會，
And if I don't get this second chance,

2121
01:17:21,331 --> 01:17:22,698
那我就結束了
then it's over for me

2122
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:25,233
夜校是我僅有的
Night school is all that I have

2123
01:17:27,372 --> 01:17:29,238
請
Please

2124
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:31,707
我會考慮一個條件
I'll consider it on one condition

2125
01:17:31,709 --> 01:17:33,375
不管是什麼
Whatever it is

2126
01:17:33,377 --> 01:17:35,243
我們讓你接受測試
We get you tested

2127
01:17:35,245 --> 01:17:37,581
性病？這不是問題
For STDs? That's not an issue

2128
01:17:39,083 --> 01:17:40,283
我不介意。我是說
I don't mind that. I mean

2129
01:17:40,285 --> 01:17:41,317
該死的
Goddamn it

2130
01:17:41,319 --> 01:17:43,051
有一次，
There was one time where, uh,

2131
01:17:43,053 --> 01:17:44,754
避孕套爆了，因為我把球放進去了
the condom popped 'cause I put my balls inside of

2132
01:17:44,756 --> 01:17:47,589
不，你這個白癡
No, you idiot

2133
01:17:47,591 --> 01:17:49,393
學習障礙
For learning disabilities

2134
01:17:51,262 --> 01:17:54,397
沒人在乎你和你的婊子們的出軌
Nobody cares about your escapades with your bitches

2135
01:17:54,399 --> 01:17:56,599
那麼，測試結果是什麼呢？
So, what are the test results,

2136
01:17:56,601 --> 01:17:57,599
凱莉？
Carrie?

2137
01:17:57,601 --> 01:18:00,237
泰迪，問題是
Teddy, the issue is

2138
01:18:01,538 --> 01:18:03,475
你臨床上很笨
you're clinically dumb

2139
01:18:06,778 --> 01:18:08,510
我就知道
I knew it

2140
01:18:08,512 --> 01:18:11,112
我知道這是一個錯誤，我知道這是一個錯誤
I knew it was a mistake I knew it was a mistake

2141
01:18:11,114 --> 01:18:13,548
男孩，對不起，我只是打擾你
Boy, I'm sorry I'm just messing with you

2142
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:15,183
來吧，凱莉，看，看
Come on, Carrie Look, look

2143
01:18:15,185 --> 01:18:16,419
我的懷疑是對的，
My suspicions were right,

2144
01:18:16,421 --> 01:18:19,421
我的朋友，你有閱讀障礙
and you, my friend, are dyslexic

2145
01:18:19,423 --> 01:18:21,323
行
Okay

2146
01:18:21,325 --> 01:18:23,325
好吧，那只是意味著我有問題
Okay, so that just means I'm having problems

2147
01:18:23,327 --> 01:18:25,059
閱讀和寫作，對吧？
with my reading and my writing, right?

2148
01:18:25,061 --> 01:18:27,730
是的，但是你也有計算障礙
Yep, but you also have dyscalculia

2149
01:18:27,732 --> 01:18:29,665
椎間盤突出症...我甚至不知道怎麼發音
Discalcu... I don't even know how to pronounce that

2150
01:18:29,667 --> 01:18:33,003
基本上，這就像誦讀困難症，但與數學有關
Basically, it's like dyslexia but with math

2151
01:18:35,105 --> 01:18:36,538
這就是我得到的
That's what I got

2152
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:38,073
我就知道
I knew it

2153
01:18:38,075 --> 01:18:39,742
既然你這麼說，那就有道理了
Now that you say it, it makes sense

2154
01:18:39,744 --> 01:18:41,142
如果你帶我去餐館
If you take me to a restaurant

2155
01:18:41,144 --> 01:18:42,377
你說，泰迪，留下小費，
and you say, Teddy, leave the tip,

2156
01:18:42,379 --> 01:18:43,445
我到處都是
I'm-I'm all over the place

2157
01:18:43,447 --> 01:18:44,613
這正是它
That's exactly what it is

2158
01:18:44,615 --> 01:18:46,448
我們做到了哦，我們還沒有做到
We did it Oh, we're not done

2159
01:18:46,450 --> 01:18:48,783
你也有加工障礙
You also have a processing disorder

2160
01:18:48,785 --> 01:18:51,186
我得了前列腺癌？
I got a touch of prostate cancer?

2161
01:18:51,188 --> 01:18:53,255
她一次也沒碰我的屁股
She didn't touch my ass one time

2162
01:18:53,257 --> 01:18:55,257
我說加工障礙。
I said processing disorder.

2163
01:18:55,259 --> 01:18:57,526
凱莉，如果你不幫我，
Carrie, if you're not going to help me,

2164
01:18:57,528 --> 01:18:58,827
那我們就浪費時間了
then we're wasting our time

2165
01:18:58,829 --> 01:19:01,363
向我解釋這是什麼東西
Explain to me what this stuff is

2166
01:19:01,365 --> 01:19:02,598
如果我有進展
If I got a proc

2167
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:03,701
哦，我的上帝
Oh, my God

2168
01:19:05,302 --> 01:19:07,271
我不處理它
I'm not processing it

2169
01:19:08,739 --> 01:19:11,138
我什麼都沒處理
I didn't process none of that shit

2170
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:14,376
你只是一種又大又漂亮的混合飲料
You are just one big, beautiful mixed drink

2171
01:19:14,378 --> 01:19:15,778
學習障礙
of learning disabilities

2172
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:17,412
所以我不傻？
So I'm not dumb?

2173
01:19:17,414 --> 01:19:19,447
小子，我剛才說的時候還在玩呢
Boy, I was just playing when I said that earlier

2174
01:19:19,449 --> 01:19:22,350
沒有一個好老師會叫他們的學生啞巴
No good teacher would ever call their students dumb

2175
01:19:22,352 --> 01:19:23,852
行
Okay

2176
01:19:23,854 --> 01:19:25,820
那麼，我們如何修復它呢？讓我們談談解決方案
So, how do we fix it? Let's talk solution

2177
01:19:25,822 --> 01:19:27,522
嗯，你所擁有的沒有治癒的方法
Well, there's no cure for what you have

2178
01:19:27,524 --> 01:19:29,824
哦，我的上帝
Oh, my God

2179
01:19:29,826 --> 01:19:32,160
我得了皰疹？
I got learning herpes?

2180
01:19:32,162 --> 01:19:33,562
男孩
Boy

2181
01:19:33,564 --> 01:19:34,829
哦，媽的
Oh, shit

2182
01:19:34,831 --> 01:19:37,197
沒有學習皰疹這樣的東西
There is no such thing as learning herpes

2183
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:39,267
我渾身冒泡
I'm blistering up

2184
01:19:39,269 --> 01:19:41,436
這是因為我想
It's 'cause I'm trying to think

2185
01:19:41,438 --> 01:19:43,605
嘿，泰迪！嘿，麥克
Hey, Teddy! Hey, Mac

2186
01:19:43,607 --> 01:19:45,607
頭目嗨，夥計們
Ringleader Hi, guys

2187
01:19:45,609 --> 01:19:48,375
泰迪！是的，泰迪！泰迪！
Teddy! Yeah, Teddy! Teddy!

2188
01:19:48,377 --> 01:19:50,211
以傳統方式教學
Teaching the conventional way

2189
01:19:50,213 --> 01:19:53,148
只是不會為泰迪完成，
just isn't gonna get it done for Teddy,

2190
01:19:53,150 --> 01:19:54,416
所以我們要把它混在一起
so we're gonna mix it up

2191
01:19:54,418 --> 01:19:56,418
你在外面把它弄進來
You out here getting it in

2192
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:58,653
怎麼了，嘉莉？你為什麼在這裡？
What's going on, Carrie? Why you in here?

2193
01:19:58,655 --> 01:20:00,655
你為什麼在戒指裡？怎麼回事？
Why you in the ring? What's going on?

2194
01:20:00,657 --> 01:20:03,458
泰迪，你的困難與焦點有關
Teddy, your difficulties are focus-related

2195
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:04,359
嗯
Uh-huh

2196
01:20:04,361 --> 01:20:06,328
我的目標是消除那種思想上的喋喋不休
My goal is to remove that mind chatter

2197
01:20:06,330 --> 01:20:09,497
這樣你就可以獲得不受阻礙的神經通路
so you can achieve properly unencumbered neural pathways

2198
01:20:09,499 --> 01:20:10,865
這不是戒指
And this isn't a ring

2199
01:20:10,867 --> 01:20:12,333
它是一個六邊形
It's a hexagon

2200
01:20:12,335 --> 01:20:14,269
嗯。哦，是的
Huh. Oh, it is

2201
01:20:14,271 --> 01:20:15,403
是啊
Yeah, well

2202
01:20:15,405 --> 01:20:16,871
你為什麼脫掉鞋子？
Why you taking your shoes off?

2203
01:20:16,873 --> 01:20:18,607
這是某人的地毯嗎？
Is this somebody's carpet?

2204
01:20:18,609 --> 01:20:20,408
泰迪，81的平方根是多少？
Teddy, what's the square root of 81?

2205
01:20:20,410 --> 01:20:21,576
什麼？
What?

2206
01:20:21,578 --> 01:20:24,545
噢！噢！
Ow! Ow!

2207
01:20:24,547 --> 01:20:27,215
媽的！81的平方根是多少？
Shit! What's the square root of 81?

2208
01:20:27,217 --> 01:20:29,284
我不知道你做什麼...？
I don't know What you do...?

2209
01:20:29,286 --> 01:20:31,353
噢！嘉莉！81的平方根是多少？
Ow! Carrie! What's the square root of 81?

2210
01:20:31,355 --> 01:20:32,353
你打斷了我的胳膊！
You breaking my arm!

2211
01:20:32,355 --> 01:20:33,888
來吧，我們正在清除這些神經通路
Come on, we're clearing those neural pathways

2212
01:20:33,890 --> 01:20:35,656
不！停下來。嘿！
No! Stop. Hey!

2213
01:20:35,658 --> 01:20:37,424
你在做什麼？集中精神！
What you doing? Focus!

2214
01:20:37,426 --> 01:20:40,362
平方根！集中精神！
Square root! Focus!

2215
01:20:40,364 --> 01:20:41,663
我不知道！
I don't know!

2216
01:20:41,665 --> 01:20:44,331
哦，上帝！
Oh, God!

2217
01:20:44,333 --> 01:20:47,234
專心泰迪，專心
Concentrate Teddy, concentrate

2218
01:20:47,236 --> 01:20:48,569
來吧，泰迪，來吧
Come on, Teddy, come on

2219
01:20:48,571 --> 01:20:50,205
鈉鈉鈉鈉
Na na na-na na na

2220
01:20:50,207 --> 01:20:52,807
鈉鈉鈉鈉鈉鈉...
Na na-na na na na-na na na-na...

2221
01:20:52,809 --> 01:20:54,776
泰迪，你今天感覺如何？
How you feeling today, Teddy?

2222
01:20:54,778 --> 01:20:58,278
我感覺很好，凱莉，但是我感覺不到
I'm-I'm feeling fine, Carrie, but I ain't feeling

2223
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:00,347
這個宮城先生，好嗎？
this Mr. Miyagi shit, okay?

2224
01:21:00,349 --> 01:21:01,916
比利時的首都是什麼？
What's the capital of Belgium?

2225
01:21:01,918 --> 01:21:03,685
呃
Uh

2226
01:21:03,687 --> 01:21:04,719
閒聊
waffles

2227
01:21:04,721 --> 01:21:06,320
什麼？快跑！
What? Run!

2228
01:21:06,322 --> 01:21:07,656
你不要逃避我
Don't you run from me

2229
01:21:07,658 --> 01:21:09,590
不要逃避我，不要。他太小了
Don't you run from me Don't. He's so little

2230
01:21:09,592 --> 01:21:12,459
比利時的首都是什麼？
What is the capital of Belgium?

2231
01:21:12,461 --> 01:21:14,496
我還沒吃早飯呢！我不知道！
I haven't eaten breakfast! I don't know!

2232
01:21:14,498 --> 01:21:16,931
這不是答案！
That is not the answer!

2233
01:21:16,933 --> 01:21:18,298
假裝你死了
Pretend you're dead

2234
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:20,701
哦！哦！回來！
Oh! Oh! Get back here!

2235
01:21:20,703 --> 01:21:22,636
泰迪，集中注意力
Teddy, focus

2236
01:21:22,638 --> 01:21:24,872
集中精神，我們開始吧
Concentrate Let's do it

2237
01:21:24,874 --> 01:21:27,409
哦，告訴你我所有最深、最黑暗的秘密...
Ooh, tell you all my deepest, darkest secrets...

2238
01:21:27,411 --> 01:21:29,911
水包括...？
Water is comprised of...?

2239
01:21:29,913 --> 01:21:31,512
走吧，泰迪，你拿到了，泰迪
Let's go, Teddy You got this, Teddy

2240
01:21:31,514 --> 01:21:33,547
雨水。
Rain Rain.

2241
01:21:33,549 --> 01:21:35,349
等等，不，等等，等等
Wait, no. Wait, wait

2242
01:21:35,351 --> 01:21:37,484
我知道，我知道。嗯
I know it, I know it. Um

2243
01:21:37,486 --> 01:21:38,953
想
Think

2244
01:21:38,955 --> 01:21:40,889
集中精神！嗯...氦
Focus! Um... helium

2245
01:21:40,891 --> 01:21:42,423
不，不，不，不
No. No, no, no

2246
01:21:42,425 --> 01:21:44,591
氮氣。這是氮氣，對吧？
Nitrogen. It's nitrogen, right?

2247
01:21:44,593 --> 01:21:46,493
你最好把它弄對，這是一種氣體
You better get it right It's a gas

2248
01:21:46,495 --> 01:21:48,595
什麼？這是一種氣體！
What? It's a gas!

2249
01:21:52,803 --> 01:21:54,268
天啊！
Jesus Christ!

2250
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:55,269
給我答案！
Give me the answer!

2251
01:21:55,271 --> 01:21:56,570
說出來！
Say it!

2252
01:21:56,572 --> 01:21:57,571
給我該死的答案
Give me the damn answer

2253
01:21:57,573 --> 01:21:58,839
告訴我！
Tell me!

2254
01:21:58,841 --> 01:22:00,040
這是兩部分氫，
It's two part hydrogen,

2255
01:22:00,042 --> 01:22:01,976
一部分...任何人
one part... one

2256
01:22:01,978 --> 01:22:03,310
一部分氧氣
one part oxygen

2257
01:22:03,312 --> 01:22:05,446
是的！再說一遍
Yes! Say that again

2258
01:22:05,448 --> 01:22:06,647
他說了別讓他再說了
He said it Don't make him say it again

2259
01:22:06,649 --> 01:22:07,881
我說了兩部分氫，
I said two part hydrogen,

2260
01:22:07,883 --> 01:22:09,983
一部分氧氣
one part oxygen

2261
01:22:10,986 --> 01:22:12,019
泰迪，沒錯
Teddy, that's right

2262
01:22:12,021 --> 01:22:13,487
你說得對什麼？
You got it right What?

2263
01:22:13,489 --> 01:22:14,689
這是正確的答案
That's the correct answer

2264
01:22:14,691 --> 01:22:16,590
我說得對
I got it right

2265
01:22:16,592 --> 01:22:17,792
你說得對，泰迪
You got it right, Teddy

2266
01:22:17,794 --> 01:22:19,560
是的。是
Yeah. Yes

2267
01:22:19,562 --> 01:22:20,828
是的！
Yes!

2268
01:22:20,830 --> 01:22:22,730
對我們所有人來說，這是多麼重要的一天
What a big day for all of us

2269
01:22:22,732 --> 01:22:23,931
我真不敢相信我真的
I can't believe that I actually

2270
01:22:23,933 --> 01:22:25,800
什麼？
What?

2271
01:22:27,037 --> 01:22:28,970
那是什麼味道？那是什麼？
What is that smell? What is that?

2272
01:22:28,972 --> 01:22:31,905
哦，現在，那是一種氣體
Oh, now, that's a gas

2273
01:22:31,907 --> 01:22:34,308
你撞了我的臉，汽車...？
You bust ass in my face, Car...?

2274
01:22:34,310 --> 01:22:35,809
甲烷
Methane

2275
01:22:35,811 --> 01:22:37,044
它在我嘴裡
It's in my mouth

2276
01:22:37,046 --> 01:22:39,047
你把我的嘴唇都弄裂了
You got my lips all chapped and shit

2277
01:22:39,049 --> 01:22:40,614
這不是什麼教育
This ain't no type of education

2278
01:22:40,616 --> 01:22:42,316
這是化學戰
This is chemical warfare

2279
01:22:44,487 --> 01:22:46,653
空投給你
AirDrop it to you

2280
01:22:46,655 --> 01:22:49,924
是
Yeah

2281
01:22:51,895 --> 01:22:53,927
特裡薩，怎麼了？
Theresa, what's wrong?

2282
01:22:53,929 --> 01:22:55,496
哦
Oh

2283
01:22:55,498 --> 01:22:57,064
我只是這一切進行得太快了
I just this all went so fast

2284
01:22:57,066 --> 01:22:58,766
我不想學校停課
I don't want school to end

2285
01:22:58,768 --> 01:23:00,067
行
Okay

2286
01:23:00,069 --> 01:23:02,436
好吧，你可以和我一起上大學
Well, you can come to college with me

2287
01:23:02,438 --> 01:23:04,705
什麼？你要去嗎？嗯
What? You're going? Mm-hmm

2288
01:23:04,707 --> 01:23:06,707
我真為你高興
I'm so happy for you

2289
01:23:06,709 --> 01:23:08,408
你什麼時候決定的？
When did you decide?

2290
01:23:08,410 --> 01:23:09,610
好吧，不要誤會，
Well, don't take this the wrong way,

2291
01:23:09,612 --> 01:23:12,378
但是和你們在一起把我嚇壞了
but hanging out with you guys scared the shit out of me

2292
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:14,548
所以我想我會
So I think I'm gonna I think I'm gonna

2293
01:23:14,550 --> 01:23:15,649
用我的生命做點什麼
do something with my life

2294
01:23:15,651 --> 01:23:17,118
太棒了
That's wonderful

2295
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,887
我現在可以看到你穿著最可愛的衣服
I can just see you now in the cutest outfit

2296
01:23:19,889 --> 01:23:21,889
穿過廣場的迷你裙
little miniskirt walking through the quad

2297
01:23:21,891 --> 01:23:23,757
你緊緊抓住你的哲學論文
You're clutching onto your philosophy thesis

2298
01:23:23,759 --> 01:23:26,393
但是當你上課的時候，教授被吹走了
But when you get to class, the professor is blown away

2299
01:23:26,395 --> 01:23:27,694
是啊
by how brilliant it is Yeah

2300
01:23:27,696 --> 01:23:29,429
所以他抓住你，你可以
So he grabs onto you, and you can

2301
01:23:29,431 --> 01:23:30,731
摸摸他靠著你的大腿
feel him up against your thigh

2302
01:23:30,733 --> 01:23:32,432
呃不是以性的方式，
Uh Not in a sexual way,

2303
01:23:32,434 --> 01:23:34,367
但不是以性的方式，你知道嗎？
but not not in a sexual way, you know?

2304
01:23:34,369 --> 01:23:36,702
他看起來奇怪地像布魯諾·火星
And he looks strangely like Bruno Mars

2305
01:23:36,704 --> 01:23:37,939
儘管他是超級學者，
Even though he's super academic,

2306
01:23:37,941 --> 01:23:39,540
他有時穿粉紅色的外套
he wears, like, pink blazers sometimes

2307
01:23:39,542 --> 01:23:42,042
好吧，你仍然可以上大學

01:23:44,747 --> 01:23:46,013
我？大學？
Me? College?

2310
01:23:46,015 --> 01:23:47,613
哦，不，蘭迪不讓我去
Oh, no Randy wouldn't let me

2311
01:23:47,615 --> 01:23:50,484

Screw Randy. You can do whatever you want to do

2312
01:23:50,486 --> 01:23:51,418
你不認識蘭迪
You don't know Randy

2313
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:53,153
為什麼你不能像，嘿，蘭迪
Why can't you just be like, Hey, Randy

2314
01:23:53,155 --> 01:23:55,556
我想做這個交易。

我想成為一名牙科醫生，

2321
01:24:07,636 --> 01:24:09,502
不是埃隆·馬斯克或斯蒂芬·霍金
not Elon Musk or Stephen Hawking

2322
01:24:09,504 --> 01:24:10,703
好吧，路易斯
Well, okay, Luis

這是另一個科學實驗嗎？
Is this another science experiment?

2327
01:24:16,412 --> 01:24:19,646
哦，不，這是慶祝，巨無霸

你們都聽到音樂了嗎？

你們去舞會了嗎？

不，我在少管所真的嗎？

我帶著一個嬰兒回家

2340
01:24:40,669 --> 01:24:42,535
這是個信號，夥計們

2341
01:24:42,537 --> 01:24:44,637
什麼？是的，我們一直在努力工作

我們應該釋放一些蒸汽

我們為什麼不去舞會？

你知道嗎？下課

哦，我的上帝！

Just a slave to the game, I'm like a bird...

2349
01:25:00,521 --> 01:25:01,555
怎麼回事，特裡薩？
What the hell, Theresa?

2350

我一直在外面按喇叭

大約15分鐘

我覺得我可以突破天花板

所以我找到了一個沒有遺漏任何節奏的地方
So I find myself a place without missing a beat

2354
01:25:11,666 --> 01:25:13,165
他們給我買飲料

一個我可以自由跳舞的地方
A place where I can dance like I'm free

2356

不要這樣對我說話

2357
01:25:17,072 --> 01:25:18,238
我會跳舞，直到這些鎖鏈落下...

2358
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:19,939
我是你妻子，我不是你媽媽，
I'm your wife I'm not your mommy,

2359
01:25:19,941 --> 01:25:21,707
我不是你的清潔工

2360
01:25:21,709 --> 01:25:24,243
當我拿到GED時，我會追求我的夢想，

此外，我想定期做愛

我的意思是，像，古怪的性行為

2370
01:25:39,762 --> 01:25:40,961
我說清楚了嗎？！

2371
01:25:40,963 --> 01:25:42,728
好吧，好吧
Okay, okay

2372
01:25:42,730 --> 01:25:44,231
我很抱歉，寶貝
I'm so sorry, babe

2373
01:25:44,233 --> 01:25:46,565
我認為你是一個瘋狂的搖滾明星
I think you're a freakin' rock star

2374
01:25:46,567 --> 01:25:48,668
從你剛才對我說的話來判斷，
And judging by what you just said to me,

2375
01:25:48,670 --> 01:25:50,636
我迫不及待想成為你的色情明星
I can't wait to be your porn star

2376
01:25:50,638 --> 01:25:51,939

我希望這一拳能一直打下去

01:28:13,748 --> 01:28:16,182
我永遠不會放棄夢想
I'm never gonna let the dream go

2440
01:28:16,184 --> 01:28:19,285
我會一直帶著這個
I'll take this all the way

2441
01:28:19,287 --> 01:28:23,322
沒人會停止做夢的no one ' s ever，ever will stop the dream
Nobody's ever, ever gonna stop el sueno

2442
01:28:23,324 --> 01:28:25,658
啊，啊，啊
Ah, ah, ah

2443
01:28:25,660 --> 01:28:29,028
沒有沙漠，沒有蛇會帶我下去
No desert, no snake gonna take me down

2444
01:28:29,030 --> 01:28:31,896
帶我下去
Take me down

2445
01:28:31,898 --> 01:28:34,400
等等，甜心，誰在看孩子們？
Wait, s-sweetheart, who-who's watching the kids?

2446
01:28:34,402 --> 01:28:36,301
我有保險
I got it covered

2447
01:28:36,303 --> 01:28:39,105
她說，我想成為一名空姐。
She said, I want to be a flight attendant.

2448
01:28:39,107 --> 01:28:41,006
你看到了嗎？
You see?

2449
01:28:41,008 --> 01:28:43,975
我想從一個地方走到另一個地方
I want to go from place to place

2450
01:28:43,977 --> 01:28:46,345
這就像去...
It'd be like going...

2451
01:28:46,347 --> 01:28:48,615
你們都在聽嗎？
Is y'all little bitches listening?

2452
01:28:50,017 --> 01:28:53,185
你知道，凱莉，你太不可思議了
You know, Carrie, you are incredible

2453
01:28:53,187 --> 01:28:54,953
我是認真的
I'm serious

2454
01:28:54,955 --> 01:28:55,854
從來沒有老師
There's never been a teacher

2455
01:28:55,856 --> 01:28:57,889
相信我和你一樣
that believe in me the way that you do

2456
01:28:57,891 --> 01:28:59,724
泰迪，我能說什麼？
Teddy, what can I say?

2457
01:28:59,726 --> 01:29:03,129
你在這麼短的時間里長得這麼大
You've grown so much in such a short period of time

2458
01:29:03,131 --> 01:29:05,030
如果你跟上所有的東西
And if you keep up with all the stuff

2459
01:29:05,032 --> 01:29:08,166
我們一直在做的事情，你已經在路上了
that we've been doing, you are well on your way

2460
01:29:08,168 --> 01:29:10,034
我只是
I'm just

2461
01:29:10,036 --> 01:29:12,370
我真的，真的為你驕傲
I'm really, really proud of you

2462
01:29:19,146 --> 01:29:21,946
你知道，凱莉，呃
You know, Carrie, uh

2463
01:29:21,948 --> 01:29:25,250
過去的幾周令人驚訝
these past few weeks have been amazing

2464
01:29:25,252 --> 01:29:27,852
我的意思是，我們的化學，不言而喻，
I mean, our chemistry, it goes without saying,

2465
01:29:27,854 --> 01:29:28,920
它很結實
it's strong

2466
01:29:28,922 --> 01:29:30,855
我感覺到了。我知道你也是
I sense it. I know you do, too

2467
01:29:30,857 --> 01:29:32,123
但是像這些時刻一樣神奇
But as magical as these moments

2468
01:29:32,125 --> 01:29:33,224
可能是
that we've been having may be

2469
01:29:33,226 --> 01:29:35,126
傻瓜，我是同性戀
Fool, I'm gay

2470
01:29:35,128 --> 01:29:36,727
我不想玩
I'm not trying to play

2471
01:29:36,729 --> 01:29:38,063
現在，我不是說我不是怪胎，
Now, I'm not saying I ain't no freak,

2472
01:29:38,065 --> 01:29:39,265
因為我會把它落在你身上
cause I'd drop it off on you

2473
01:29:39,267 --> 01:29:40,499
我是女同性戀
I'm a lesbian

2474
01:29:40,501 --> 01:29:43,768
如果你想繼續演戲，你可以
If you want to pursue acting, you can

2475
01:29:43,770 --> 01:29:45,103
不，我是同性戀
No, I'm gay

2476
01:29:45,105 --> 01:29:46,771
再說一遍。聽起來你好像說你是同性戀
Say that again. It sound like you said you're gay

2477
01:29:46,773 --> 01:29:48,239
我是同性戀
I'm gay

2478
01:29:48,241 --> 01:29:50,409
我喜歡女人
I like women

2479
01:29:50,411 --> 01:29:51,943
你確定？因為我越來越
Are you sure? Because I'm getting

2480
01:29:51,945 --> 01:29:53,479
一種完全不同的氛圍哦，不！
a whole different vibe Oh, hell no!

2481
01:29:53,481 --> 01:29:55,715
我很確定哦，上帝
I'm pretty sure Oh, God

2482
01:29:57,117 --> 01:29:59,184
泰迪？
Teddy?

2483
01:29:59,186 --> 01:30:02,087
左邊的那個是你喜歡的類型嗎？
Is the, is the one on the left your type?

2484
01:30:02,089 --> 01:30:03,821
呃，穿緊身衣的那個是
Uh-uh, the one in the tight dress is

2485
01:30:03,823 --> 01:30:05,025
媽的，那是我的
Shit, that's mine

2486
01:30:06,092 --> 01:30:07,892
嘿
Hey

2487
01:30:07,894 --> 01:30:09,894
他們去了
There they go

2488
01:30:09,896 --> 01:30:11,362
在這裡幹嗎？
What are you doing here?

2489
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:13,198
嗯？
Huh?

2490
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:15,166
你在高中畢業舞會上做什麼？
What are you doing at a high school prom?

2491
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:17,835
什麼...寶貝，你在這裡幹什麼？
What, uh... what-what are you doing here, babe?

2492
01:30:17,837 --> 01:30:20,271
為什麼是你...你為什麼在這裡？
Why you... why you here?

2493
01:30:20,273 --> 01:30:21,372
帕特斯基校長對我們感興趣
Principal Patowsky is interested in us

2494
01:30:21,374 --> 01:30:23,807
重新設計學校，所以他讓我們停下來
redesigning the school, so he asked us to stop by

2495
01:30:23,809 --> 01:30:25,010
哦，他做到了，嗯？
Oh, he did, huh?

2496
01:30:26,447 --> 01:30:28,313
打得好，斯圖爾特
Well played, Stewart

2497
01:30:28,315 --> 01:30:30,448
你們倆認識嗎？
You two know each other?

2498
01:30:30,450 --> 01:30:32,383
問斯圖爾特
Ask Stewart

2499
01:30:32,385 --> 01:30:34,452
嗯，是的，我們一起上高中
Uh, yes, we went to high school together

2500
01:30:34,454 --> 01:30:37,187
我想我在第一次會議上提到過這一點
I think I mentioned that at our first meeting

2501
01:30:37,189 --> 01:30:39,926
不，不，你沒有
No. No, you didn't

2502
01:30:41,294 --> 01:30:43,294
泰迪，我很困惑
Teddy, I am so confused

2503
01:30:43,296 --> 01:30:45,963
你為什麼在這裡？她是誰？
Why are you here? And who is she?

2504
01:30:45,965 --> 01:30:47,798
我可以解釋這不是它的樣子
I can explain It ain't what it look like

2505
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:49,468
我和一群孩子在這裡，
I'm in here with a bunch of kids,

2506
01:30:49,470 --> 01:30:51,269
穿著街頭服裝
dressed in street clothes

2507
01:30:51,271 --> 01:30:54,205
然後記得我炸了燒烤小屋
Then remember I blew out the, uh, Barbecue Shack

2508
01:30:54,207 --> 01:30:56,074
火把我從那東西裡救了出來
Fire took me out of that thing

2509
01:30:56,076 --> 01:30:58,476
現在我的擋風玻璃被弄髒了
And now my windshield was-was messed

2510
01:30:58,478 --> 01:31:00,378
讓我把車搞砸了
got me messed up about the car

2511
01:31:00,380 --> 01:31:03,915
我的剎車失靈了，因為我倒車了，嗯
My brakes ain't working, 'cause I backed into this, um

2512
01:31:03,917 --> 01:31:06,184
她是同性戀。她甚至沒有
She gay. She ain't even

2513
01:31:06,186 --> 01:31:08,319
她甚至對我不感興趣
She ain't even interested in me

2514
01:31:08,321 --> 01:31:10,188
因此...因此
So... so

2515
01:31:10,190 --> 01:31:11,389
該死的
Goddamn it

2516
01:31:11,391 --> 01:31:12,457
elizabeth的暱稱
Lisa

2517
01:31:12,459 --> 01:31:13,559
現在不行。不是現在，等等
Not now. Not now Wait

2518
01:31:13,561 --> 01:31:14,828
elizabeth的暱稱
Lisa

2519
01:31:16,329 --> 01:31:17,829
好吧，麗莎
Okay, Lisa

2520
01:31:17,831 --> 01:31:19,197
麗莎，麗莎
Lisa, Lisa

2521
01:31:19,199 --> 01:31:20,531
麗莎，你能聽嗎？
Lisa, can you listen, please?

2522
01:31:20,533 --> 01:31:22,533
麗莎，請聽著
Lisa, please just listen

2523
01:31:22,535 --> 01:31:24,970
什麼？泰迪，你想說什麼？
What? What are you gonna say, Teddy?

2524
01:31:27,073 --> 01:31:29,073
我是高中輟學生
I'm a high school dropout

2525
01:31:29,075 --> 01:31:31,109
好嗎？裡面那個女人，
Okay? That woman in there,

2526
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:33,877
凱莉，那是我的夜校老師
Carrie that's my night school teacher

2527
01:31:33,879 --> 01:31:35,446
這就是我這些晚上一直在做的事情
That's what I've been doing all these evenings

2528
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:37,282
我一直在學習以獲得我的GED
I've been studying to get my GED

2529
01:31:37,284 --> 01:31:39,185
這樣我就能在馬文家找到一份工作
so that I can get a job at Marvin's

2530
01:31:40,353 --> 01:31:41,986
所以你現在不在那裡工作？
So you don't work there now?

2531
01:31:41,988 --> 01:31:43,854
我沒有
I don't

2532
01:31:43,856 --> 01:31:45,490
我還沒有在那裡工作
I don't work there yet

2533
01:31:45,492 --> 01:31:47,558
現在我在一家快餐店工作
Right now I work at a fast food restaurant

2534
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:49,594
叫做基督教雞，
called Christian Chicken,

2535
01:31:49,596 --> 01:31:52,130
因為某種原因，雞肉是基督教的
where the chicken is Christian for some reason

2536
01:31:52,132 --> 01:31:53,231
哦，等等。麗莎，
Oh, wait. L-Lisa,

2537
01:31:53,233 --> 01:31:54,365
麗莎，麗莎，讓我來
Lisa, Lisa, let me just

2538
01:31:54,367 --> 01:31:55,500
在你評判他之前，先說這個
say this before you judge him

2539
01:31:55,502 --> 01:31:57,167
這不是普通雞
It ain't that average chicken

2540
01:31:57,169 --> 01:31:58,935
這不是一樣的快餐
It's not the same fast food

2541
01:31:58,937 --> 01:32:00,971
你從這些小兜帽上得到的
that you be getting from these other little hood spots

2542
01:32:00,973 --> 01:32:03,308
它有味道...我不知道他們是否使用針頭，
It's got the flavor... I don't know if they use a needle,

2543
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:05,078
但是他們得到了傑倫、傑倫、傑倫的味道！
but they get the flavor Jaylen, Jaylen, Jaylen!

2544
01:32:06,146 --> 01:32:07,345
你怎麼知道我的名字？
How do you know my name?

2545
01:32:07,347 --> 01:32:09,514
我的黑鬼一直在班上談論你
My nigga be talking about you in the class all the time

2546
01:32:09,516 --> 01:32:12,249
他說你很壞我不知道你那麼壞
He said you was bad I didn't know you was that bad

2547
01:32:12,251 --> 01:32:14,052
我們是泰迪的同學，我是特裡薩
We're Teddy's classmates I'm Theresa

2548
01:32:14,054 --> 01:32:17,322
那是傑倫、米拉、麥肯齊和路易斯·嘿
That's Jaylen, Mila, Mackenzie, and Luis Hey

2549
01:32:17,324 --> 01:32:19,590
你記得我嗎？實際上我是服務員
You remember me? I-I was actually the waiter

2550
01:32:19,592 --> 01:32:22,593
在餐館裡，泰迪拔掉了他所有的陰毛，
at the restaurant when Teddy pulled all of his pubes,

2551
01:32:22,595 --> 01:32:24,528
然後...他把它們放在芝士蛋糕裡
and then... and he put 'em in the cheesecake

2552
01:32:24,530 --> 01:32:25,997
擺脫支付
to get out of paying

2553
01:32:25,999 --> 01:32:29,099
現在我們是最好的朋友
Now we're best friends

2554
01:32:30,470 --> 01:32:32,404
謝謝你的誠實
Thank you for your honesty

2555
01:32:34,506 --> 01:32:35,539
誠實
Honesty

2556
01:32:35,541 --> 01:32:38,309
我知道
I know

2557
01:32:38,311 --> 01:32:40,645
這是一個很大的挑戰
that this is a lot to take in

2558
01:32:40,647 --> 01:32:41,679
真的嗎？
Really?

2559
01:32:41,681 --> 01:32:43,380
但是如果你讓我解釋一下
But if you let me explain

2560
01:32:43,382 --> 01:32:45,148
不，如果你只是...如果你讓我解釋
No If you just... if you let me explain

2561
01:32:45,150 --> 01:32:47,086
不，泰迪，我聽完你的解釋了
No, Teddy, I'm done with your explanations

2562
01:32:48,954 --> 01:32:50,457
你對我撒謊了
You lied to me about everything

2563
01:32:51,957 --> 01:32:53,090
為什麼？
Why?

2564
01:32:53,092 --> 01:32:55,025
給我留下深刻印象？
To impress me?

2565
01:32:55,027 --> 01:32:57,194
泰迪，我自己賺錢
Teddy, I make my own money

2566
01:32:57,196 --> 01:32:59,529
你以為我在乎你開哪種車
You think I care about what kind of car you drive

2567
01:32:59,531 --> 01:33:01,699
或者你戴什麼樣的手錶？
or what kind of watch you have on?

2568
01:33:01,701 --> 01:33:04,101
那不是我
That's not me

2569
01:33:04,103 --> 01:33:06,203
如果你這麼想，那你就不認識我了
If you think that, then you don't know me

2570
01:33:06,205 --> 01:33:07,504
這不是真的
That's not true

2571
01:33:07,506 --> 01:33:08,605
如果你不認識我，
If you don't know me,

2572
01:33:08,607 --> 01:33:09,673
那你就不能真正愛我
then you couldn't truly love me

2573
01:33:09,675 --> 01:33:11,343
這不是真的，麗莎
That's not true, Lisa

2574
01:33:14,514 --> 01:33:16,281
今晚不要回到公寓
Don't come back to the apartment tonight

2575
01:33:19,451 --> 01:33:22,454
嗯，也許你可以和你的夜校朋友呆在一起
Well, maybe you could stay with your night school friend

2576
01:33:25,492 --> 01:33:27,527
也許她會有一些用處
Maybe she'd have some use for this

2577
01:33:28,661 --> 01:33:31,263
這可能是假的，對吧？
It's probably fake, right?

2578
01:33:35,033 --> 01:33:36,031
elizabeth的暱稱
Lisa

2579
01:33:36,033 --> 01:33:37,100
列斯
Lis

2580
01:33:37,102 --> 01:33:38,170
麗莎！
Lisa!

2581
01:33:48,045 --> 01:33:49,980
我切掉了外殼，
I cut the crust off,

2582
01:33:49,982 --> 01:33:52,082
你喜歡它嗎
just how you like it

2583
01:33:52,084 --> 01:33:53,650
謝謝，媽
Thanks, Ma

2584
01:33:53,652 --> 01:33:57,587
你沒有認真跳過GED考試吧？
You're not seriously skipping that GED test, are you?

2585
01:33:57,589 --> 01:33:59,121
是
Yeah

2586
01:33:59,123 --> 01:34:01,659
我是說，我是在為麗莎做這些事情
I mean, I was doing all that stuff for Lisa

2587
01:34:01,661 --> 01:34:04,327
如果她不在，那又有什麼意義呢？
If she's not around, then what's the point?

2588
01:34:04,329 --> 01:34:06,463
我可憐的孩子，我感覺很糟糕
My poor baby, I feel terrible

2589
01:34:06,465 --> 01:34:09,499
哦，格拉迪絲，現在，別再溺愛這個男孩了
Oh, Gladys, now, stop coddling this boy

2590
01:34:09,501 --> 01:34:11,133
西奧多，
You know, Theodore,

2591
01:34:11,135 --> 01:34:12,769
你是個成年人
you're a grown-ass man

2592
01:34:12,771 --> 01:34:14,739
你需要振作起來
You need to get your shit together

2593
01:34:14,741 --> 01:34:16,139
我知道，爸爸
I know, Dad

2594
01:34:16,141 --> 01:34:18,375
我的意思是，你說你有閱讀障礙，
I mean, you say you got dyslexia,

2595
01:34:18,377 --> 01:34:20,644
發育障礙。
dyscoglia.

2596
01:34:20,646 --> 01:34:22,144
計算障礙
Dyscalculia

2597
01:34:22,146 --> 01:34:23,647
不管你怎麼說
However you say it

2598
01:34:23,649 --> 01:34:26,116
問題是你不誠實
The issue is you're dishonest

2599
01:34:26,118 --> 01:34:28,084
我不怪那個女孩拋棄了你
I don't blame that girl for dumping you

2600
01:34:28,086 --> 01:34:31,089
傑拉爾德，夠了
Now, Gerald, that is enough Uh-huh

2601
01:34:32,324 --> 01:34:34,256
你知道，也許你是對的
You know, maybe you're right

2602
01:34:34,258 --> 01:34:36,292
也許我活該
Maybe I do deserve it

2603
01:34:36,294 --> 01:34:37,461
你覺得呢？
You think?

2604
01:34:37,463 --> 01:34:40,063
我在諷刺你
I was being sarcastic

2605
01:34:40,065 --> 01:34:42,399
我會幫你準備好床的，寶貝
I'll get your bed ready, baby

2606
01:34:42,401 --> 01:34:44,201
你想吃點什麼嗎？
Would you like a tuck-in?

2607
01:34:44,203 --> 01:34:45,404
是的，請
Yes, please

2608
01:34:46,605 --> 01:34:47,771
謝謝你，媽媽
Thank you, Mom

2609
01:34:47,773 --> 01:34:49,408
給你什麼，親愛的
Anything for you, darling

2610
01:34:55,180 --> 01:34:56,548
我失敗了
I failed

2611
01:34:58,717 --> 01:35:00,986
作為父親，我失敗了
I failed as a father

2612
01:35:02,087 --> 01:35:03,655
插兜？
A tuck-in?

2613
01:35:06,325 --> 01:35:08,558
哦，我的天啊，他為什麼這樣上公共汽車？
Oh, my gosh, why'd he come on the bus like that?

2614
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:10,562
我不知道他沒有朋友
I don't know He ain't got no friends

2615
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:16,166
有什麼問題嗎？
What's the problem?

2616
01:35:18,102 --> 01:35:19,603
基督教雞！
Christian Chicken!

2617
01:35:19,605 --> 01:35:21,505
叫我可憐的先生
Call me Mr. Pitiful

2618
01:35:21,507 --> 01:35:23,506
如果你喜歡雞肉，按一下喇叭
Honk once if you love chicken

2619
01:35:23,508 --> 01:35:26,276
如果你愛上帝，按兩下喇叭
Honk twice if you love the Lord

2620
01:35:26,278 --> 01:35:28,111
如果你願意，來拿你的雞肉
Come and get your chicken if you

2621
01:35:28,113 --> 01:35:29,646
準備開始獲勝
ready to start winning

2622
01:35:29,648 --> 01:35:31,113
嘿
Hey

2623
01:35:31,115 --> 01:35:32,281
賣完了！
Sellout!

2624
01:35:32,283 --> 01:35:33,315
什麼？
What?

2625
01:35:33,317 --> 01:35:34,784
你賣完了，夥計
You a sellout, man

2626
01:35:34,786 --> 01:35:36,218
兄弟，我只是想誠實的生活
Brother, I'm just trying to make an honest living

2627
01:35:36,220 --> 01:35:37,420
你為什麼不離開我？
Why don't you get off my back?

2628
01:35:37,422 --> 01:35:39,422
那就去郵局找份工作吧
Go get a job at the post office, then

2629
01:35:39,424 --> 01:35:41,190
滾出去什麼？再說一遍！
Get your ass up out of here What? Say it again!

2630
01:35:41,192 --> 01:35:42,325
來吧，夥計！
Come on, man!

2631
01:35:42,327 --> 01:35:43,392
繼續吧
Go ahead with that

2632
01:35:43,394 --> 01:35:44,628
保持清醒，布拉赫
Stay woke, brah

2633
01:35:44,630 --> 01:35:47,698
是啊，我看到你吃了雞肉，你這個狗娘養的
Yeah, well, I see you ate the chicken, you son of a bitch

2634
01:35:50,235 --> 01:35:52,204
所以，這就是現在的情況，嗯？
So, this is what it's come to, huh?

2635
01:35:55,206 --> 01:35:57,206
你有膽量，夥計
You got some nerve, man

2636
01:35:57,208 --> 01:35:58,543
泰迪，看
Teddy, look

2637
01:36:00,177 --> 01:36:02,812
我是來道歉的
I came here to apologize

2638
01:36:02,814 --> 01:36:05,114
我休息了
I'm on my break

2639
01:36:05,116 --> 01:36:07,182
我沒有時間看這個泰迪，請聽著
I ain't got time for this Teddy, please, just listen

2640
01:36:07,184 --> 01:36:08,651
我不想聽你說什麼，夥計
I don't want to hear nothing you got to say, man

2641
01:36:08,653 --> 01:36:09,485
不，請聽我說
No, please just listen to me

2642
01:36:09,487 --> 01:36:10,619
我沒有什麼要對你說的
I don't have nothing to say to you

2643
01:36:10,621 --> 01:36:12,655
我只是...嗯，我有話要對你說，好嗎？
I just... well, I have something to say to you, okay?

2644
01:36:12,657 --> 01:36:13,757
什麼？什麼？給我30秒，好嗎？
What? What? Give me 30 seconds, okay?

2645
01:36:13,759 --> 01:36:15,292
30 seconds. Go

2646
01:36:15,294 --> 01:36:17,359
聽著，當我們在高中的時候，
Listen, when-when we were in high school,

2647
01:36:17,361 --> 01:36:18,795
你擁有了我想要的一切
you had everything that I wanted

2648
01:36:18,797 --> 01:36:20,496
你還有28秒
You got 28 seconds left

2649
01:36:20,498 --> 01:36:21,898
我只有分數
I had grades That's all I had

2650
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:25,201
你有運動，朋友，女孩
You-you had sports, friends, girls

2651
01:36:25,203 --> 01:36:26,836
我吸了所有這些
I sucked at all that

2652
01:36:26,838 --> 01:36:28,772
當我得到第一手工作時，我27歲
I was 27 when I got my first hand job

2653
01:36:28,774 --> 01:36:31,640
你在一號，但在我離開之前，
You're at one, but before I before I walk away,

2654
01:36:31,642 --> 01:36:33,208
我想告訴你這很難過
I want to tell you that's sad

2655
01:36:33,210 --> 01:36:34,343
這是我的觀點，我不在乎
That's my point I don't care

2656
01:36:34,345 --> 01:36:35,444
你為什麼告訴我？我的觀點是
Why are you telling me? My point is

2657
01:36:35,446 --> 01:36:37,814
我是一個晚熟的人，我絕望而悲傷，
I was a late bloomer, and I was desperate and sad,

2658
01:36:37,816 --> 01:36:39,281
我責怪你
and I blamed you

2659
01:36:39,283 --> 01:36:41,517
那天晚上，
And the other night,

2660
01:36:41,519 --> 01:36:44,653
當我報復的時候，感覺很糟糕
when I got my revenge, it felt awful

2661
01:36:44,655 --> 01:36:46,755
我接受教育是為了有所作為
I got into education to make a difference

2662
01:36:46,757 --> 01:36:49,326
在人們的生活中，不要毀掉他們
in people's lives, not to ruin them

2663
01:36:49,328 --> 01:36:50,860
還有，
Also,

2664
01:36:50,862 --> 01:36:53,562
我告訴斯圖爾特我打了他的屁股
I told Stewart here I'd beat his ass

2665
01:36:53,564 --> 01:36:55,464
如果他沒有來道歉
if he didn't come and apologize

2666
01:36:55,466 --> 01:36:56,865
那是真的那是一部分
That is true That was a part

2667
01:36:56,867 --> 01:36:58,400
一部分，一小部分
part of it, a small part

2668
01:36:58,402 --> 01:36:59,902
好吧，你們知道嗎，夥計們？
Okay, you know what, guys?

2669
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:03,640
我欣賞整個課後特殊時刻
I appreciate the whole after-school special moment

2670
01:37:03,642 --> 01:37:05,809
但是要明白我沒事
But understand that I am okay

2671
01:37:05,811 --> 01:37:07,743
我是我應該去的地方
I am where I'm supposed to be

2672
01:37:07,745 --> 01:37:09,378
好嗎？你的命運是工作
All right? Your destiny is to work

2673
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:11,447
在脫衣舞俱樂部旁邊的快餐店？
at a fast food joint next to a strip club?

2674
01:37:11,449 --> 01:37:13,883
是的。好吧，如果我站在正確的位置
Yes. All right, if I stand in the right spot

2675
01:37:13,885 --> 01:37:16,285
在這個停車場，我能聞到可可脂的味道
in this parking lot, I can smell cocoa butter

2676
01:37:16,287 --> 01:37:18,253
和炸雞
and fried chicken at the same time

2677
01:37:18,255 --> 01:37:20,789
我不知道你們的情況，但這對我來說是一場勝利
And I don't know about you guys, but that's a win for me

2678
01:37:20,791 --> 01:37:23,325
泰迪，聽我說。泰德不是泰迪，聽著。
Teddy, l-listen to me. Ted Ain't no Teddy, listen.

2679
01:37:23,327 --> 01:37:24,727
你知道我不會通過考試的，
You know I wasn't gonna pass that test,

2680
01:37:24,729 --> 01:37:26,261
所以不要坐在這裡，表現得像
so don't sit here and act like

2681
01:37:26,263 --> 01:37:27,897
這不會是不同的故事
it wasn't gonna be a different story

2682
01:37:27,899 --> 01:37:29,331
不要表現得像你不想要的那樣
And don't act like you don't want

2683
01:37:29,333 --> 01:37:30,799
終於可以說我是啞巴了
to be able to finally say that I'm dumb

2684
01:37:30,801 --> 01:37:31,667
不，你沒有
No, you're not

2685
01:37:31,669 --> 01:37:33,902
你終於可以說了，斯圖，說吧
You can finally say it, Stew Say it

2686
01:37:33,904 --> 01:37:35,971
泰迪
Teddy

2687
01:37:35,973 --> 01:37:38,507
你是很多東西
you are a lot of things

2688
01:37:38,509 --> 01:37:39,876
騙子
A hustler

2689
01:37:39,878 --> 01:37:41,310
騙子
A liar

2690
01:37:41,312 --> 01:37:42,845
你很矮
You're very short

2691
01:37:42,847 --> 01:37:45,314
瘋狂大聲，嗯
Mad loud, too Mmm

2692
01:37:45,316 --> 01:37:47,616
但是你不傻
But you are not dumb

2693
01:37:47,618 --> 01:37:50,987
現在，你穿的這套衣服真蠢
Now, this suit you got on is dumb as hell

2694
01:37:50,989 --> 01:37:52,721
我責備你...？
I rebuke you You...?

2695
01:37:52,723 --> 01:37:54,456
責備。我責備你！
Rebuke. I rebuke you!

2696
01:37:54,458 --> 01:37:55,924
男孩...給我這個我要去工作的東西
Boy... give me this thing I'm going to work

2697
01:37:55,926 --> 01:37:57,626
現在，讓我回到你在做什麼？
Now, let me go back to What you doing?

2698
01:37:57,628 --> 01:37:58,861
你在做什麼，夥計？脫下這套衣服，
What you doing, man? Take this suit off,

2699
01:37:58,863 --> 01:38:00,930
你要參加這個測試不，不，不，不，不，不，不
and you gonna take this test No, no, no, no, no, no, no

2700
01:38:00,932 --> 01:38:02,564
不，讓我們用我們的話來說，你要參加這次考試嗎
No, let's use our words You gonna take this test

2701
01:38:02,566 --> 01:38:03,699
好了，過來你知道嗎？
All right, come here You know what?

2702
01:38:03,701 --> 01:38:04,867
你在做什麼？她有一條腰帶
What you doing? She has a belt

2703
01:38:04,869 --> 01:38:05,734
她有皮帶！
She's got a belt!

2704
01:38:05,736 --> 01:38:07,469
你要脫下這套衣服嘿！
You gonna take this suit off Hey!

2705
01:38:07,471 --> 01:38:08,871
呃，夥計們，夥計們，夥計們，夥計們
Uh, guys, guys, guys, guys

2706
01:38:08,873 --> 01:38:10,773
你停下！你呆在那裡！放開我！
You stop! You stay there! Get off me!

2707
01:38:10,775 --> 01:38:12,507
這會傷害我，而不是傷害你

現在，在我們結束之前，
Now, before we conclude,

2863
01:44:53,342 --> 01:44:55,241
我相信你們中的一些人在想
I'm sure some of you are wondering

2864
01:44:55,243 --> 01:44:59,312
為什麼我們的舞台上有成年學生
why we have adult students with us onstage

2865
01:44:59,314 --> 01:45:01,148
你們都知道，

我是一個創新者

2867
01:45:03,085 --> 01:45:05,018
特立獨行的人

我不玩遊戲

所以我決定，

加入我們的長輩

呃，讓我先告訴你們
Uh, let me just start off by telling you guys

2885
01:45:42,757 --> 01:45:44,126
關於我的一些事情
a little something about me

2886
01:45:45,460 --> 01:45:48,261
我是泰迪·沃克，還有
I'm Teddy Walker, and

2887
01:45:48,263 --> 01:45:50,029
我是個騙子
I'm a liar

2888
01:45:51,867 --> 01:45:55,368
多年來，我一直在假裝是別人
For years, I've been pretending to be somebody else

2889
01:45:55,370 --> 01:45:57,337
我不是的人
Somebody that I'm not

2890
01:45:57,339 --> 01:46:02,275
我這樣做的原因是因為我感到羞愧
And my reason for doing that is because I was ashamed

2891
01:46:02,277 --> 01:46:05,713
很慚愧我沒有像我的同學一樣學習
Ashamed that I didn't learn like my classmates

2892
01:46:07,115 --> 01:46:10,716
很慚愧我不能參加考試
Ashamed that I couldn't take a test

2893
01:46:10,718 --> 01:46:13,753
很慚愧我讓我的家人和朋友失望了
Ashamed that I let my family and my friends down

2894
01:46:13,755 --> 01:46:16,923
我的意思是，我投入了太多的時間和精力去創造
I mean, I put so much time and energy into creating

2895
01:46:16,925 --> 01:46:19,325
這個假版本的泰迪·沃克
this fake version of Teddy Walker

2896
01:46:19,327 --> 01:46:22,728
我忘記了在學校學習的價值
that I forgot the value that went into learning in school

2897
01:46:22,730 --> 01:46:24,931
我說的是誠實
I'm talking about honesty

2898
01:46:24,933 --> 01:46:27,167
我在說接受你是誰
I'm talking about accepting who you are

2899
01:46:27,169 --> 01:46:28,968
直到我遇見
And it wasn't until I met

2900
01:46:28,970 --> 01:46:32,372
我驚人的夜校同學和
my amazing night school classmates and

2901
01:46:32,374 --> 01:46:35,443
一個真正相信我的老師
and a teacher that actually believed in me

2902
01:46:37,112 --> 01:46:41,447
我能夠接受我是誰
that I was able to accept who I was

2903
01:46:41,449 --> 01:46:43,516
作為一個帶著一船貨物的大嘴巴騙子
As a loudmouth hustler with a boatload

2904
01:46:43,518 --> 01:46:46,320
學習障礙
of learning disabilities

2905
01:46:55,029 --> 01:46:57,829
你知道，對你們中任何一個曾經掙扎過的人來說
You know, for any of you who may have struggled

2906
01:46:57,831 --> 01:47:00,098
麗莎第一次做對了。-嗨
to get it right the first time Lisa. - Hi

2907
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:02,402
我是活生生的證據
that I am living proof

2908
01:47:02,404 --> 01:47:06,972
你可以在第二次機會把它集合起來
that you can get it together on a second chance

2909
01:47:06,974 --> 01:47:08,807
我的意思是，我有很多機會
I mean, I done had a lot of chances

2910
01:47:08,809 --> 01:47:10,209
嗯
Mm-hmm

2911
01:47:10,211 --> 01:47:12,545
因為我搞砸了很多
'Cause I messed up a lot
嗯
Mm-hmm

2912
01:47:12,547 --> 01:47:15,415
但是我到了另一邊
But I made it to the other side

2913
01:47:15,417 --> 01:47:17,015
我是說，見鬼，我們都有
I mean, hell, we all did

2914
01:47:17,017 --> 01:47:18,218
對吧，夜校的工作人員？
Ain't that right, night school crew?

2915
01:47:18,220 --> 01:47:19,485
是啊
Hell yeah

2916
01:47:21,956 --> 01:47:23,889
我們都有第二次機會
We all got second chances

2917
01:47:23,891 --> 01:47:25,193
還有我爸爸
And to my dad

2918
01:47:26,528 --> 01:47:28,194
他是...他對我很嚴厲
He was... he was tough on me

2919
01:47:28,196 --> 01:47:31,063
他說了一些事情，但是他說這些是出於愛
He said some things, but he said it out of love

2920
01:47:32,534 --> 01:47:34,099
爸爸，我知道你不是故意的
Dad, I know you ain't never mean it

2921
01:47:34,101 --> 01:47:35,500
當你過去說一些事情的時候
when you used to say some of the things

2922
01:47:35,502 --> 01:47:37,003
你以前說過的
that you used to say

2923
01:47:37,005 --> 01:47:38,338
你知道，你曾經說過這樣的話，
You know, you used to say stuff like,

2924
01:47:38,340 --> 01:47:40,506
我希望我沒有擁有你。
I wish I ain't never had you.

2925
01:47:40,508 --> 01:47:43,108
或者像，呃，
Or like, uh,

2926
01:47:43,110 --> 01:47:44,843
那是浪費精子。哦！
That was a waste of sperm. Oh!

2927
01:47:44,845 --> 01:47:46,511
哦，上帝，如果我可以的話
Oh Oh, God, if I could

2928
01:47:46,513 --> 01:47:48,814
把螺母拿回來。我記得你說過
get that nut back. I remember you said that

2929
01:47:48,816 --> 01:47:51,117
但是所有這些都是出於愛
But all that stuff was said out of love

2930
01:47:51,119 --> 01:47:52,884
來激勵和推動我
to motivate me and push me

2931
01:47:52,886 --> 01:47:54,920
你認為你做得不好，
And you thought you didn't do good,

2932
01:47:54,922 --> 01:47:56,090
但是現在看著我
but look at me now

2933
01:47:57,458 --> 01:48:00,192
一切皆有可能！
Anything is possible!

2934
01:48:05,966 --> 01:48:07,866
我做到了！
I did it!
