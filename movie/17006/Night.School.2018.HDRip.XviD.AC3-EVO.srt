That's not even close.

12

No.

13

What do you mean,
you're protesting

17
00:01:05,748 --> 00:01:07,514
the State Achievement Test?

18
00:01:07,516 --> 00:01:10,085
Sounds like someone's
unprepared.

19
00:01:10,087 --> 00:01:11,719
- I am prepared.
- Mmm.

20
00:01:11,721 --> 00:01:13,120
To take a stand.

21
00:01:13,122 --> 00:01:14,588
Pops, those standardized tests

22
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,190
are culturally biased.

23
00:01:16,192 --> 00:01:19,094
They want me to calculate
the average number of manatees

24
00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:20,761
that are in Florida.

25
00:01:20,763 --> 00:01:21,662
What does that have to do

26
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,764
with the African-American
experience?

27
00:01:23,766 --> 00:01:25,532
You hear that, Gladys?

28
00:01:25,534 --> 00:01:27,635
We got Minister Louis Farrakhan
at the table.

29
00:01:27,637 --> 00:01:29,736
You know what, Teddy?

30
00:01:29,738 --> 00:01:31,039
The last time I checked,

31
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:33,474
your twin sister Denise here
is black,

32
00:01:33,476 --> 00:01:36,610
and she pulled a 1500
on the practice test.

33
00:01:36,612 --> 00:01:39,512
- It was actually a 1540, Daddy.
- Ah!

34
00:01:39,514 --> 00:01:42,117
You go, girl. That's my baby.

35
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,818
Just doing what I do best...
outshining Teddy's butt.

36
00:01:46,555 --> 00:01:48,923
What's this really all about,
Teddy Bear?

37
00:01:48,925 --> 00:01:50,059
Hmm?

38
00:01:51,794 --> 00:01:54,095
Do you need help?

39
00:01:54,097 --> 00:01:56,699
Is that what this is all about?

40
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,267
I don't know, Mommy.

41
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:02,036
I mean...

42
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,206
maybe I do need help.

43
00:02:06,075 --> 00:02:08,742
Help yourself
to the goddamn study book.

44
00:02:08,744 --> 00:02:11,912
Hell, you get 400 points
just for signing your name.

45
00:02:11,914 --> 00:02:14,148
You do know how to spell
your name, don't you?

46
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,283
T-H-E... What?

47
00:02:16,285 --> 00:02:17,583
You're wrong.

48
00:02:17,585 --> 00:02:18,721
Ain't no "H" in my name.

49
00:02:21,524 --> 00:02:23,491
She's spelling your legal name.

50
00:02:24,626 --> 00:02:26,193
"Theodore."

51
00:02:26,195 --> 00:02:28,528
Well, there goes
those 400 points.

52
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,998
She like a Chinese boy
at school.

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,766
Shut your pie hole!

54
00:02:37,806 --> 00:02:39,075
Everyone take a seat.

55
00:02:45,948 --> 00:02:49,051
T-H-E...

56
00:02:58,794 --> 00:03:01,228
Don't even look at him.
Stewart's an asshole.

57
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,964
Okay, students, please break
the seal on your test books

58
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:06,102
and begin.

59
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:39,165
Done.

60
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:40,733
You finished the whole test?

61
00:03:40,735 --> 00:03:42,302
No, I'm done with this.

62
00:03:42,304 --> 00:03:44,071
I'm finished!

63
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:45,772
Do I look like a sheep
to you, Marv?

64
00:03:45,774 --> 00:03:47,207
No.

65
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:49,008
You all can continue
to be sheep.

66
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,643
I'm not gonna be
nobody's sheep.

68
00:03:52,947 --> 00:03:55,049
I don't know how

69
00:03:55,051 --> 00:03:57,217
to make the noise, but you know
what I'm trying to say.

70
00:03:57,219 --> 00:03:58,718
Y'all can keep falling

71

72
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:03,222
but y'all gonna end up
in stupid student debt.

73
00:04:03,224 --> 00:04:05,091
You look like bad credit
already.

reeks of Discover cards,
with your broke ass.

76
00:04:10,665 --> 00:04:12,366
I'm gonna be a winner.
I'm gonna succeed

77

in the school of life,
doing real stuff.

78
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,103
I'm gonna get me
a real fly car,

79
00:04:17,105 --> 00:04:18,872
and I'm gonna have me
a nice girl.

80
00:04:18,874 --> 00:04:19,973
Y'all ain't gonna make it.

81
00:04:19,975 --> 00:04:21,674
Ted, get out!

82
00:04:21,676 --> 00:04:22,975
Denise got hair on her titties.

83

Cat's out of the bag.

you're a small woman,

00:06:55,196 --> 00:06:57,129
I can see it in your eyes,
Morris.

165
00:06:57,131 --> 00:06:58,531
But I can also tell
that your wife...

166
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:00,168
you know, your wife
isn't on the same page.

167
00:07:01,536 --> 00:07:03,268
I mean, it's not
like she completely

168
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,869
controls the purse strings.

169
00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:09,075
Enjoy it.

170
00:07:09,077 --> 00:07:11,009
Don't you let me down.

171
00:07:13,348 --> 00:07:15,347
You better stop it, man.

172
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:16,381
Don't you start that.

173
00:07:16,383 --> 00:07:18,050
That was a master class.

174
00:07:18,052 --> 00:07:20,019
I couldn't get Bobby Flay
to buy that beast.

175
00:07:20,021 --> 00:07:22,087
You know what?
Once I saw the man purse,

176
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:24,089
the guy was putty in my hands.
He really was.

177
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,925
Teddy, I just want you to know

178
00:07:26,927 --> 00:07:29,361
you are like the son
I never had.

179
00:07:29,363 --> 00:07:31,399
Well, I mean, come on,
you got Joe Junior.

180
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:35,368
Well, yeah,
but he's the son I do have,

181
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,570
and I'm just not
all that crazy about it.

182
00:07:37,572 --> 00:07:39,237
I mean, look at him.

183
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:42,141
But my point is this...
all those years ago,

184
00:07:42,143 --> 00:07:44,610
I took a chance
on a pimply-faced teenager.

185
00:07:44,612 --> 00:07:47,212
My little Gary Coleman.

186
00:07:47,214 --> 00:07:48,614
My little Webster.

187
00:07:48,616 --> 00:07:52,050
And it turned out great
for both of us.

188
00:07:52,052 --> 00:07:55,123
So I've decided,
when I retire...

189
00:07:56,491 --> 00:07:58,591
I'm turning Barbecue City...

190
00:07:58,593 --> 00:08:01,926
over... to you.

191
00:08:01,928 --> 00:08:03,595
Excuse me?

192
00:08:03,597 --> 00:08:05,330
What?

193
00:08:05,332 --> 00:08:07,233
Uh, don't-don't shit me.

194
00:08:07,235 --> 00:08:08,334
I'm serious.

195
00:08:08,336 --> 00:08:10,001
Oh, my God, Joe.

196
00:08:10,003 --> 00:08:11,403
I just got-got goose bumps.

197
00:08:11,405 --> 00:08:13,872
- Yes!
- I got goose bumps all over.

198
00:08:13,874 --> 00:08:15,373
I don't know what to say, man.
Thank you.

199
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,108
No. Thank you...

200
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,477
son.

201
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,646
What you talkin' 'bout, Joe?

202
00:08:20,648 --> 00:08:22,881
You gotta come here, Mr. Drummond.

203
00:08:22,883 --> 00:08:23,917
Come here.

204
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:27,054
All yours, Teddy.

205
00:08:28,455 --> 00:08:29,988
- What do you think?
- Oh...

206
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,590
It's amazing.

207
00:08:31,592 --> 00:08:32,525
- Really?
- Yeah.

208
00:08:32,527 --> 00:08:34,993
But as your unofficial
financial advisor,

209
00:08:34,995 --> 00:08:36,294
I'm obligated to tell you

210
00:08:36,296 --> 00:08:38,296
that this ring is way out
of your budget.

211
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:39,564
Relax.

212
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:40,598
Lisa's cool as hell.

213
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,000
She knows who you are.

214
00:08:42,002 --> 00:08:43,636
Lisa does not know who I am.

215
00:08:43,638 --> 00:08:46,338
Lisa knows that I'm
a successful barbecue salesman.

216
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,173
Marvin knows that Teddy's
a high school dropout

217
00:08:48,175 --> 00:08:50,208
that's living
paycheck to paycheck

218
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,243
'cause I'm with a woman that's
way above my weight class.

219
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:54,613
Your life is built
on a financial house of cards.

220
00:08:54,615 --> 00:08:56,649
- Stop it.
- The Porsche, the duplex.

221
00:08:56,651 --> 00:08:58,684
What are you trying to prove?

222
00:08:58,686 --> 00:09:00,185
Plus, every single time
we go out,

223
00:09:00,187 --> 00:09:01,553
she offers to pay
for the check.

224
00:09:01,555 --> 00:09:03,254
The day that I let her
put down her plastic

225
00:09:03,256 --> 00:09:04,422
is the day that I lose her.

226
00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:06,692
- And you know that.
- I don't know why I was so nervous.

227
00:09:06,694 --> 00:09:08,093
- It's coming together.
- Hey.

228
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,627
- Hi.
- Lisa.

229
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:11,463
- Hi!
- <i>Bienvenue.</i>

230
00:09:11,465 --> 00:09:14,366
Dude, Lisa's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

231
00:09:14,368 --> 00:09:17,134
I don't want to mess
this one up, man.

232
00:09:17,136 --> 00:09:19,003
- I told them.
- He did.

233
00:09:19,005 --> 00:09:20,271
He actually said that.

234
00:09:20,273 --> 00:09:21,706
- Ooh.
- Look at that.

235
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,041
- That looks amazing.
- Some dessert.

236
00:09:23,043 --> 00:09:24,242
- Wow.
- Wow. Thank you.

237
00:09:24,244 --> 00:09:26,211
- Mmm. - Thank you so much.
- Chef Clemont also said

238
00:09:26,213 --> 00:09:27,412
that there will be no check.

239
00:09:27,414 --> 00:09:29,647
This is all on him.

240
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:31,516
- Wow.
- I knew he would try this.

241
00:09:31,518 --> 00:09:33,518
You know what?
Tell him I appreciate it,

242
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,120
- but I insist on paying.
- Okay.

243
00:09:35,122 --> 00:09:36,454
- Yeah.
- Okay, well, just wait.

244
00:09:36,456 --> 00:09:38,323
Well, hold on, now, honey.

245
00:09:38,325 --> 00:09:39,457
Honey, you don't want
to offend him.

246
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:41,058
You're his guest, right?

247
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,527
Trust me, you never take
a free meal from a client.

248
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:43,661
That way,
you don't owe them anything.

249
00:09:43,663 --> 00:09:45,263
- That's true.
- Thank you, Lisa.

250
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:46,364
- I appreciate it.
- You know.

251
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:47,532
- Um...
- Whenever you're ready.

252
00:09:47,534 --> 00:09:49,066
Thank you.

253
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:50,635
You know what?
You know what, then, baby?

254
00:09:50,637 --> 00:09:52,136
If that's the case,
sweetie, then let me...

255
00:09:52,138 --> 00:09:53,504
No. Baby, this is my thing.

256
00:09:53,506 --> 00:09:55,340
There's like eight of us.
I got it.

257
00:09:55,342 --> 00:09:57,142
- You can probably write it off, right?
- Yes.

258
00:09:57,144 --> 00:09:59,344
I didn't think about that.
It is a business expense.

259
00:09:59,346 --> 00:10:00,612
- Okay. - Yeah.
- Come on.

260
00:10:00,614 --> 00:10:02,045
W-W-Wait, wait.
Hold-hold up, Lis.

261
00:10:02,047 --> 00:10:04,448
It is a business expense,
but, Lis...

262
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,418
it's clear that Teddy
really wants to treat.

263
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,188
We're all here celebrating you,
so let him.

264
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:13,223
Right, Teddy?

265
00:10:13,225 --> 00:10:14,692
Yes.

266
00:10:14,694 --> 00:10:15,760
Wow.

267
00:10:15,762 --> 00:10:18,530
Yes. Wh-Why aren't we closer?

268
00:10:18,532 --> 00:10:19,764
- 'Cause you get me.
- Mmm.

269
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:21,433
I have it. I got it.

270
00:10:21,435 --> 00:10:22,634
- I love you.
- Love you back.

271
00:10:22,636 --> 00:10:24,001
Black love.

272
00:10:24,003 --> 00:10:25,369
Okay.

273
00:10:25,371 --> 00:10:27,237
Oh, shit.

274
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:28,405
All right, Marvin, hit me.

275
00:10:28,407 --> 00:10:29,641
Thank you.

276
00:10:29,643 --> 00:10:31,743
- This is so good.
- One of my favorite things that he does.

277
00:10:31,745 --> 00:10:33,478
- That caramel tart, he's known for it.
- All right.

278
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,447
Oh, I gotta get in that.

279
00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:37,181
Definitely gonna try that.

280
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,248
Uh-uh.

281
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,751
- So amazing.
- Aren't these beautiful?

282
00:10:39,753 --> 00:10:41,452
- He did these just for us.
- Really?

283
00:10:41,454 --> 00:10:43,121
Yeah.
You should try this caramel.

284
00:10:43,123 --> 00:10:44,255
I'm gonna... I'm gonna take
a little bit of it.

285
00:10:44,257 --> 00:10:46,591
- Get in there.
- Take me through... take me through...

286
00:10:46,593 --> 00:10:48,158
Lisa, take me through.
So this is a chair.

287
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,293
Straight up, it's a chair.

288
00:10:49,295 --> 00:10:51,061
I know that much, but what...
tell me about... give me

289
00:10:51,063 --> 00:10:52,029
the <i>Behind the Music</i>
about the chair.

290
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,263
Pretend I'm on VH1
or something like that.

291
00:10:53,265 --> 00:10:55,400
Well, actually, these chairs
have a very interesting story.

292
00:10:55,402 --> 00:10:56,768
They're from Denmark.

293
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,770
- Found them in a warehouse.
- Whoa.

294
00:10:58,772 --> 00:11:01,438
Mid-century, modern,
kind of rounded.

295
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,372
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

296
00:11:02,374 --> 00:11:03,574
I know it's blue and...

297
00:11:03,576 --> 00:11:05,476
I didn't know you were so into chairs.

298
00:11:05,478 --> 00:11:06,578
Oh, you would not believe...
I'll go home,

299
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,779
I'll look at my chair,
I get turned on in a second.

300
00:11:07,781 --> 00:11:09,814
- It's just a weird fetish.
- You would love these because...

301
00:11:09,816 --> 00:11:12,282
I don't know if you noticed
the cerulean kind of

302
00:11:12,284 --> 00:11:13,617
- undertone of the wallpaper...
- Woof.

303
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:16,220
...but we kind of wanted
to tie it all together,

304
00:11:16,222 --> 00:11:18,089
to kind of offset the harder,
more straighter lines,

305
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:19,624
- and...
- What is that? I...

306
00:11:19,626 --> 00:11:21,559
I found this fabric in Italy.
It's 100%...

307
00:11:21,561 --> 00:11:23,160
Oh, my God.

308
00:11:23,964 --> 00:11:25,797
Oh, my God!

309
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:28,065
- No, no, no!
- What?

310
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:29,801
Is there a problem
with the dessert, sir?

311
00:11:29,803 --> 00:11:31,503
I think that's pubic hair
in the cake.

312
00:11:31,505 --> 00:11:33,070
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my gosh.

313
00:11:33,072 --> 00:11:34,505
Is this pubic hair
in my damn dessert?

314
00:11:34,507 --> 00:11:35,341
May I?

315
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,376
- I'm sorry, what?
- May I please take it?

316
00:11:39,378 --> 00:11:41,178
Literally,
I'm telling you what it is.

317
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,114
Uh...

318
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:50,122
This is way too many pubes.

319
00:11:51,156 --> 00:11:52,256
What does that mean?

320
00:11:52,258 --> 00:11:53,625
I mean, one is too many pubes.

321
00:11:53,627 --> 00:11:55,158
If you could tell the chef.

322
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,628
Thank you. Thank you for
taking care of this for us.

323
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,529
I believe you planted these.

324
00:11:58,531 --> 00:12:00,764
- No, no, no.
- What'd you just say?

325
00:12:00,766 --> 00:12:02,599
Stop. I got this.
That's insane of you.

326
00:12:02,601 --> 00:12:04,368
I've known this man
my entire life.

327
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,504
- He's not a pube planter, sir.
- No, no, no.

328
00:12:06,506 --> 00:12:08,539
Stop, Marv. Stop.
Maybe you planted them.

329
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,107
- What?
- Boom.

330
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:11,675
I risked my life
coming to this country

331
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:13,644
so I can plant pubes on
some random guy's cheesecake?

332
00:12:13,646 --> 00:12:15,212
I don't know
what you're into, man.

333
00:12:15,214 --> 00:12:16,880
And I have a flash of news
for you, guy.

334
00:12:16,882 --> 00:12:19,416
- I man-scape down here.
- Okay.

335
00:12:19,418 --> 00:12:21,418
That's my woman, and that's
too much information.

336
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,654
And these are the pubes

337
00:12:23,656 --> 00:12:25,656
of an African-American guy.

338
00:12:25,658 --> 00:12:28,224
- Oh, shit.
- What? That's racist, man.

339
00:12:28,226 --> 00:12:29,459
It's descriptive.

340
00:12:29,461 --> 00:12:31,395
- "Descriptive," my ass. That's racist.
- Luis?

341
00:12:31,397 --> 00:12:33,730
That's what they are...
Afro pubes.

342
00:12:33,732 --> 00:12:34,731
Friends, friends,
what is happening?

343
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:35,732
What is happening?

344
00:12:35,734 --> 00:12:37,167
Pubes and racism.

345
00:12:37,169 --> 00:12:38,368
Chef Clemont...

346
00:12:40,271 --> 00:12:41,404
- Mm-hmm.
- All right? I go to take

347
00:12:41,406 --> 00:12:42,539
a bite of my cheesecake.

348
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,341
There's what appears
to be pubic hair

349
00:12:44,343 --> 00:12:45,442
in my cake.

350
00:12:45,444 --> 00:12:46,677
That he planted with his

351
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,712
African-American
short-and-curlies.

352
00:12:48,714 --> 00:12:49,646
Say "African-American" again,

353
00:12:49,648 --> 00:12:51,515
and I'm-a get dark
and curly in your ass!

354
00:12:51,517 --> 00:12:53,517
- I will say it again!
- All right, say it again!

355
00:12:55,387 --> 00:12:56,888
Please, everyone, calm down.

356
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,156
I am mortified by this.
I am so sorry here, everyone.

357
00:12:59,158 --> 00:13:01,358
- Uh, the meal is on me.
- No.

358
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,593
This is what he wants.

359
00:13:02,595 --> 00:13:04,561
- Luis, I need to speak to you in the kitchen.
- Thank you.

360
00:13:04,563 --> 00:13:05,562
Go in the kitchen, man.

361
00:13:05,564 --> 00:13:06,864
You're going to die.

362
00:13:06,866 --> 00:13:08,699
Luis, I need to speak to you
in the kitchen.

363
00:13:08,701 --> 00:13:10,233
You messed with the wrong guy.

364
00:13:10,235 --> 00:13:11,435
Luis, right now.

365
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:12,669
- Right now.
- You better go.

366
00:13:12,671 --> 00:13:13,704
Okay, baby, just...

367
00:13:13,706 --> 00:13:14,938
You better go!

368
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,840
- Gotta be kidding me.
- Chef, please,

369
00:13:16,842 --> 00:13:19,209
- he's been...
- I, uh... I don't want to get into it.

370
00:13:19,211 --> 00:13:21,612
Feel like it's a cloud
of racism around me.

371
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:24,848
Teddy, what is going on?

372
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,516
Haven't we had
enough surprises tonight?

373
00:13:26,518 --> 00:13:28,517
Well, I promise you

374
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:31,254
that this one
will be worth it, okay?

375
00:13:31,256 --> 00:13:32,623
Oh, my God.

376
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,458
What's all this?

377
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,628
Well, I will tell you
what's going on.

378
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,395
So, listen to this.

379
00:13:39,397 --> 00:13:42,332
Joe told me today
that when he retires

380
00:13:42,334 --> 00:13:44,234
he's leaving all of this to me.

381
00:13:44,236 --> 00:13:46,803
- Baby, that's amazing.
- I mean, it's life-changing.

382
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:49,271
- Yeah.
- And maybe you could

383
00:13:49,273 --> 00:13:51,574
put your touch on this place,
change the design,

384
00:13:51,576 --> 00:13:53,342
help take it to the next level?

385
00:13:53,344 --> 00:13:54,745
I'm so proud of you. Yeah.

386
00:13:54,747 --> 00:13:55,946
- Maybe we expand?
- Yes.

387
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:57,381
- Franchise, even?
- Yeah.

388
00:13:57,383 --> 00:13:58,682
Yes. Oh, yeah.

389
00:13:58,684 --> 00:14:00,383
Baby, we-we could do a lot
with this place.

390
00:14:00,385 --> 00:14:01,685
First of all,
we could change the logo.

391
00:14:01,687 --> 00:14:03,887
"Barbecue Nation."
"Barbecue Safari."

392
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:05,622
I mean, there are
so many things we could do.

393
00:14:05,624 --> 00:14:06,990
Honestly, I have so many ideas.

394
00:14:06,992 --> 00:14:08,159
I...

395
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:12,328
I just know that with you
by my side,

396
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,699
that anything is possible.

397
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,372
Oh, my God.

398
00:14:26,678 --> 00:14:28,878
- Yes.
- Yes?

399
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,947
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes?

400
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:32,716
Mmm.

401
00:14:32,718 --> 00:14:34,519
Mmm, mmm.

402
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,787
Wait, the ring. Here.

403
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:38,254
You gotta put the...
put the ring on.

404
00:14:38,256 --> 00:14:39,522
Oh, my God.

405
00:14:39,524 --> 00:14:41,892
- I love it.
- Let's celebrate, then.

406
00:14:41,894 --> 00:14:44,326
- Huh? You know I had to get some champagne.
- Oh, my God.

407
00:14:44,328 --> 00:14:46,328
I said, "Look, uh, my baby
gonna like it."

408
00:14:47,766 --> 00:14:49,732
Let me pour some
champagne for my fiancée.

409
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:51,300
"Fiancée."

410
00:14:51,302 --> 00:14:52,968
All right, let's make a toast.

411
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:55,507
- To us.
- To us.

412
00:15:00,678 --> 00:15:01,877
- Baby?
- Hmm?

413
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:03,045
Do you smell gas?

414
00:15:03,047 --> 00:15:04,647
I was nervous, babe.

415
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:06,750
I didn't know you'd smell it.
I tried to...

416
00:15:06,752 --> 00:15:08,417
No, that's, um...

417
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:10,352
Actual... like, the propane?

418
00:15:10,354 --> 00:15:11,487
Why don't you go stand outside,

419
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:13,789
I'll situate everything
in here, and I'll get you home.

420
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:14,957
- Okay.
- Love you.

421
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,325
Be ready.

422
00:15:16,327 --> 00:15:17,561
Mm-hmm.

423
00:15:17,563 --> 00:15:19,295
<i>So, guys...</i>

424
00:15:19,297 --> 00:15:22,800
my sweet little Teddy Bear
just popped the question.

425
00:15:26,804 --> 00:15:27,972
And big surprise...

426
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:32,776
I said yes!

427
00:15:32,778 --> 00:15:34,543
Shit!

428
00:15:40,718 --> 00:15:43,720
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

429
00:15:43,722 --> 00:15:45,554
Oh, God! Baby.

430
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,392
Teddy, are you okay?

431
00:15:50,394 --> 00:15:53,429
I need you to tell
my fiancée there's...

432
00:15:53,431 --> 00:15:54,998
there's been an accident.

433
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,933
Baby, it's me.

434
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:59,635
Can you see me? Teddy?

435
00:15:59,637 --> 00:16:01,537
I'm your fiancée.

436
00:16:01,539 --> 00:16:02,905
Good.

437
00:16:02,907 --> 00:16:04,874
I've been in an accident.

438
00:16:04,876 --> 00:16:06,076
Oh, baby.

439
00:16:09,914 --> 00:16:12,481
<i>So, Joe didn't have insurance?</i>

440
00:16:12,483 --> 00:16:14,016
Yeah, of course he did, Marv.

441
00:16:14,018 --> 00:16:16,118
He took the money
and ran off to Florida.

442
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,487
Dude, I've been looking
for a job everywhere, man.

443
00:16:18,489 --> 00:16:20,689
But there are no
decent sales jobs for

444
00:16:20,691 --> 00:16:22,491
an Employee of the Month
at Barbecue City.

445
00:16:22,493 --> 00:16:24,827
We'd hire you here,
but you need to get your GED.

446
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:27,462
Think about it.
These guys bullshit clients

447
00:16:27,464 --> 00:16:29,698
all day about funds
they don't understand.

448
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,533
You would be a natural.

449
00:16:30,535 --> 00:16:31,801
So you're saying
that if I graduated

450
00:16:31,803 --> 00:16:34,570
- from high school, that then you could get me a job here?
- Yeah.

451
00:16:34,572 --> 00:16:36,872
But you hate school,
so why are we even having

452
00:16:36,874 --> 00:16:38,741
- this conversation?
- No, no, no. I'm not talking

453
00:16:38,743 --> 00:16:39,975
about going to school.

454
00:16:39,977 --> 00:16:41,610
I'm talking about
getting my GED.

455
00:16:41,612 --> 00:16:42,845
And that's different.

456
00:16:42,847 --> 00:16:44,080
See, to get my GED,

457
00:16:44,082 --> 00:16:45,948
all I gotta do is go
to the school,

458
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,149
charm the principal
a little bit.

459
00:16:47,151 --> 00:16:48,984
- Right? Get what I want.
- Yeah.

460
00:16:48,986 --> 00:16:51,519
Which is my GED.
Sounds pretty easy to me, Marv.

461
00:16:51,521 --> 00:16:54,490
- If you got your GED...
- Huh?

462
00:16:54,492 --> 00:16:56,492
I could probably hook you up.

463
00:16:56,494 --> 00:16:58,027
Listen to me, though.
Stop it. Stop, okay?

464
00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:00,395
Do yourself a favor,
and do not tell Lisa about this

465
00:17:00,397 --> 00:17:01,764
until it's a done deal.

466
00:17:01,766 --> 00:17:04,166
Now, you know I'm smarter
than that, Marv.

467
00:17:04,168 --> 00:17:05,835
You're gonna be
a financial analyst?

468
00:17:05,837 --> 00:17:07,469
Yes, I am.

469
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:09,572
I am, babe,
and it starts immediately.

470
00:17:09,574 --> 00:17:12,074
I was talking to Marv, and he
says that they could really use

471
00:17:12,076 --> 00:17:13,876
somebody with my skill set
at his firm.

472
00:17:13,878 --> 00:17:15,077
That's great.

473
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,611
That's a great opportunity.

474
00:17:16,613 --> 00:17:19,182
Um... yeah, I mean, I'm-I'm...

475
00:17:19,184 --> 00:17:22,051
I'm basically pumped up
about it, you know?

476
00:17:22,053 --> 00:17:23,619
- You are so resilient, baby.
- Mmm.

477
00:17:23,621 --> 00:17:25,720
You keep bouncing back.
I am so proud of you.

478
00:17:25,722 --> 00:17:26,889
Yep.

479
00:17:26,891 --> 00:17:28,123
I love you.

480
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,727
I love you, too.

481
00:17:33,931 --> 00:17:36,131
Ma, of course
the thong is gonna

482
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:37,900
cut you in the booty hole.

483
00:17:37,902 --> 00:17:39,834
That's what it do.
Look, next time Leon

484
00:17:39,836 --> 00:17:42,004
want to stick somebody
in a thong, you tell him

485
00:17:42,006 --> 00:17:44,139
that he need to put it on
and get a mirror

486
00:17:44,141 --> 00:17:45,774
and check and see
what <i>his</i> balls do.

487
00:17:45,776 --> 00:17:48,743
I don't care
if he <i>is</i> your pastor.

488
00:17:48,745 --> 00:17:52,147
Do the congregation know
he a freak like that?

489
00:17:53,718 --> 00:17:55,084
Hold on, Mama.

490
00:17:55,086 --> 00:17:56,886
Can I help you, sir?

491
00:17:56,888 --> 00:17:58,620
Um...

492
00:17:58,622 --> 00:18:02,057
I couldn't help but overhear
your conversation.

493
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:03,992
- Excuse me?
- You kind of loud.

494
00:18:03,994 --> 00:18:05,628
Well, then get out of my car.

495
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,129
I'm not in your car.
I'm clearly in my car.

496
00:18:07,131 --> 00:18:09,530
- No, you're in my car.
- You're speaking loud enough...

497
00:18:09,532 --> 00:18:11,133
What are you,
the volume control police?

498
00:18:11,135 --> 00:18:12,467
I'm not sure
if that's even a thing.

499
00:18:12,469 --> 00:18:13,601
Mind your business.

500
00:18:13,603 --> 00:18:15,103
Your business
is becoming my business.

501
00:18:15,105 --> 00:18:16,604
Why don't you work
on your windshield?

502
00:18:16,606 --> 00:18:17,973
Now you're really
in my business.

503
00:18:17,975 --> 00:18:18,974
Probably look like
a kaleidoscope

504
00:18:18,976 --> 00:18:20,142
when you look through it.

505
00:18:20,144 --> 00:18:21,542
You know,
why don't you just...?

506
00:18:21,544 --> 00:18:22,510
You probably feel like
a little honeybee.

507
00:18:22,512 --> 00:18:24,646
- Enough.
- Looking at 18 things at one time,

508
00:18:24,648 --> 00:18:26,514
but really you're just looking
at one thing.

509
00:18:26,516 --> 00:18:27,715
I-I-I'm gonna get
in your business now.

510
00:18:27,717 --> 00:18:30,485
Tell your mother that she can
go buy a box of G-strings

511
00:18:30,487 --> 00:18:31,787
with her nasty ass.

512
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:33,088
You're talking
about my mama now?

513
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,090
Any pastor that's putting
a thong on his balls

514
00:18:35,092 --> 00:18:36,524
ain't right with God.

515
00:18:36,526 --> 00:18:38,192
- Pssh. What?
- Don't "pssh" me.

516
00:18:38,194 --> 00:18:39,594
Pssh.

517
00:18:40,597 --> 00:18:41,997
Yeah.

518
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:45,034
I bet that hurt your throat.

519
00:18:45,036 --> 00:18:46,235
Drive your car.

520
00:18:46,237 --> 00:18:47,202
What, Mama?

521
00:18:47,204 --> 00:18:48,270
Your mother's nasty.

522
00:18:48,272 --> 00:18:50,171
Girl, yeah, that's a little
ol' burnt leprechaun

523
00:18:50,173 --> 00:18:53,208
sitting next to me at this damn
light all in our conversation.

524
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,911
- Excuse me? Hey.
- Nah, girl, you know he ain't got no gold.

525
00:18:55,913 --> 00:18:57,079
You know he ain't got no gold.

526
00:18:57,081 --> 00:18:58,247
- How about you grow up?
- Bye, boo!

527
00:18:58,249 --> 00:18:59,847
Hey.

528
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:01,950
Speak... speaking of toast,
if you...?

529
00:19:01,952 --> 00:19:03,818
Goddamn it, Teddy.

530
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,119
- I gotta work...
- Hey, yo!

531
00:19:05,121 --> 00:19:06,621
- Who you honk...?
- Let's go!

532
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,057
I can't even see...
Where's my mirror?

533
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:10,591
- Yo, man!
- Hey, who you honking at?

534
00:19:26,843 --> 00:19:28,642
<i>So, game the system again,</i>

535
00:19:28,644 --> 00:19:29,812
<i>did we, Teddy?</i>

536
00:19:29,814 --> 00:19:31,713
<i>Stewart,
what is your problem with me?</i>

537
00:19:31,715 --> 00:19:33,881
My problem with you, Teddy,
is that students like you

538
00:19:33,883 --> 00:19:35,817
bring down the reputation
of this high school.

539
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:37,185
You may have everybody else

540
00:19:37,187 --> 00:19:38,853
at this school fooled,
but I know

541
00:19:38,855 --> 00:19:40,254
you're actually covering up
for the fact

542
00:19:40,256 --> 00:19:42,091
that you're really just
not that smart.

543
00:19:42,093 --> 00:19:44,559
In fact, you might be the
dumbest student at this school.

544
00:19:44,561 --> 00:19:46,261
- ♪ Uh-oh
- <i>♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪</i>

545
00:19:46,263 --> 00:19:48,997
- <i>♪ Yeah ♪</i> - ♪ Uh-oh ♪
- <i>♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪</i>

546
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:51,698
- ♪ Uh-oh
- <i>♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. ♪</i>

547
00:19:55,172 --> 00:19:57,972
I am the music teacher.

548
00:19:57,974 --> 00:20:00,908
I don't know the first thing
about teaching biology.

549
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,844
Oh, for God's sakes!

550
00:20:02,846 --> 00:20:05,613
What part of
"there is no musical program"

551
00:20:05,615 --> 00:20:07,149
do you not understand, Trish?

552
00:20:07,151 --> 00:20:09,050
Nobody's getting
into Ivy League schools

553
00:20:09,052 --> 00:20:10,818
- on a bassoon scholarship.
- Oh, shit.

554
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,687
<i>You know, I'm not book smart.</i>

555
00:20:12,689 --> 00:20:14,322
Stewart's smarter than me.

556
00:20:14,324 --> 00:20:16,024
But you know what I'm not?

557
00:20:16,026 --> 00:20:17,725
I'm not a freak of nature,
Stew.

558
00:20:17,727 --> 00:20:18,993
Uh-oh, Stew.

559
00:20:18,995 --> 00:20:20,362
Don't do this, Teddy.

560
00:20:20,364 --> 00:20:22,296
Hey, quick question, everybody.

561
00:20:22,298 --> 00:20:25,133
Has anybody here ever seen
Stewart with his shirt off?

562
00:20:25,135 --> 00:20:27,335
It's a birthmark.
It's a birthmark!

563
00:20:27,337 --> 00:20:29,737
- If it's a birthmark, let us see it right now.
- Prove it.

564
00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:31,739
You all want to see
my birthmark?

565
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:32,807
- Yes!
- Come on! I'm dying!

566
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:34,008
I'll prove it. See?

567
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,779
It's a birthmark!

568
00:20:38,781 --> 00:20:41,014
You got a pig's butthole
on your chest, man.

569
00:20:41,016 --> 00:20:43,151
There's no hole in it,
so how could it be a butthole?

570
00:20:43,153 --> 00:20:45,153
<i>You got a third nipple, man!</i>

571
00:20:45,155 --> 00:20:46,888
Who's next, Dolores?

572
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,825
This young man right here.

573
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,264
Hey. What's up, Stewart?

574
00:20:55,165 --> 00:20:57,965
We had good times, didn't we?

575
00:20:57,967 --> 00:21:00,902
I laugh at how much we laughed.

576
00:21:00,904 --> 00:21:03,173
That's some...

577
00:21:09,979 --> 00:21:11,279
So, uh...

578
00:21:11,281 --> 00:21:13,314
how long you been
the principal, man?

579
00:21:13,316 --> 00:21:14,714
Going on two years.

580
00:21:14,716 --> 00:21:16,350
- Wow.
- Yeah. Wasn't easy,

581
00:21:16,352 --> 00:21:20,822
but, uh, cleaned this place up
using my brain and my bat.

582
00:21:20,824 --> 00:21:22,990
As opposed to when we went
to high school,

583
00:21:22,992 --> 00:21:25,293
now, if you have
a "D" average, you're out.

584
00:21:25,295 --> 00:21:26,860
Can you do that?

585
00:21:26,862 --> 00:21:28,297
I can do whatever I want,
Teddy.

586
00:21:29,433 --> 00:21:31,199
This my house.

587
00:21:31,201 --> 00:21:33,835
I'm sorry, what...
what was that last part?

588
00:21:33,837 --> 00:21:34,938
I said look around you.

589
00:21:35,904 --> 00:21:39,407
This is... my...

590
00:21:39,409 --> 00:21:41,377
house.

591
00:21:43,446 --> 00:21:45,879
Excuse me for asking, but are
you doing a black voice?

592
00:21:45,881 --> 00:21:48,048
No, no. Not a black voice.

593
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,950
- You sure?
- I don't hear color.

594
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:53,020
- Mmm.
- What brings you back to Piedmont, Mr. Walker?

595
00:21:53,022 --> 00:21:55,857
Right now I'm transitioning
from an amazing job in sales

596
00:21:55,859 --> 00:21:57,858
to a job in finance,
and the only thing

597
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,826
that's really holding up
this transition

598
00:21:59,828 --> 00:22:02,295
is me not having my GED.

599
00:22:02,297 --> 00:22:04,264
So, I don't know,
I was thinking maybe I could

600
00:22:04,266 --> 00:22:06,400
get you to cross some T's,
dot some I's.

601
00:22:06,402 --> 00:22:08,269
Maybe you could do

602
00:22:08,271 --> 00:22:10,204
a favor for an old friend.

603
00:22:10,206 --> 00:22:12,273
Some things just
never change, huh, Teddy?

604
00:22:12,275 --> 00:22:14,107
You want me to help you

605
00:22:14,109 --> 00:22:17,311
find a shortcut
to getting your diploma.

606
00:22:17,313 --> 00:22:18,446
No.

607
00:22:18,448 --> 00:22:19,880
Yes.

608
00:22:19,882 --> 00:22:21,415
Hmm.

609
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:24,050
I wish I could. I really do.

610
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:25,385
But you would have to go

611
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:28,755
to night school to learn
how to pass the GED test,

612
00:22:28,757 --> 00:22:31,292
and unfortunately we don't
offer night school here.

613
00:22:31,294 --> 00:22:33,727
I'm so sorry, Teddy.

614
00:22:33,729 --> 00:22:35,431
Let me walk you out.

615
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,866
You want to touch her?

616
00:22:39,868 --> 00:22:41,801
- I'm sorry?
- Come on.

617
00:22:41,803 --> 00:22:43,970
Touch my big black bat.

618
00:22:43,972 --> 00:22:46,106
Um, no, I'm...

619
00:22:46,108 --> 00:22:48,243
Go ahead, say hi.

620
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:53,414
Ah!

621
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:56,217
You used
to call me Crazy Stewart.

622
00:22:56,219 --> 00:22:59,788
Now you call me Batman.

623
00:23:05,195 --> 00:23:06,927
Remove the
Beats by Andre, Rudy.

624
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:08,862
School policy...
no headphones on campus

625
00:23:08,864 --> 00:23:10,464
unless you're using
Rosetta Stone.

626
00:23:10,466 --> 00:23:12,832
Hey, uh... hey, Stew,
you think you're taking

627
00:23:12,834 --> 00:23:14,868
the right approach here
with these kids?

628
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,469
They look a little
stressed out, man.

629
00:23:16,471 --> 00:23:19,540
I am preparing them for
the real world, Teddy, okay?

630
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:21,775
I may not be their best friend,

631
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:23,777
- but everyone here respects me.
- Okay.

632
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:26,012
- What the fuck, Stewart?
- Uh, hey, hey, hey, hey.

633
00:23:26,014 --> 00:23:27,981
Let's watch the language,
please, Miss Carter.

634
00:23:27,983 --> 00:23:30,451
Why did you add AP Calculus
to my class load,

635
00:23:30,453 --> 00:23:32,219
knowing good and well
I already have

636
00:23:32,221 --> 00:23:34,120
five units to teach
plus night school?

637
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:35,889
- It's too much.
- Wait, hold on.

638
00:23:35,891 --> 00:23:38,158
You're... you're
the night school teacher?

639
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,160
No, I'm just a bitch
that like to wear blouses.

640
00:23:40,162 --> 00:23:41,861
Yes, I'm the night school
teacher.

641
00:23:41,863 --> 00:23:43,397
Did you bring me some
dried shamrocks, leprechaun?

642
00:23:43,399 --> 00:23:44,798
It's still not funny.

643
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,099
Wait, well, hold up.

644
00:23:46,101 --> 00:23:47,500
Stew, why'd you
just tell me that you

645
00:23:47,502 --> 00:23:48,568
don't have night school here?

646
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,270
Why would you say that?

647
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:53,940
I said that because Teddy and I
went to school together.

648
00:23:53,942 --> 00:23:57,077
He is, quite frankly,
a terrible student,

649
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:58,945
and I did not want
that element in here.

650
00:23:58,947 --> 00:24:00,846
I don't care if he's
as dumb as a Minion.

651
00:24:00,848 --> 00:24:02,582
He is welcome to take my class
if he wants.

652
00:24:02,584 --> 00:24:04,484
Thank you. Thank you for that.

653
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:06,520
You're welcome.
'Cause you-you need it.

654
00:24:06,522 --> 00:24:09,055
Carrie, can we just
take down the 'tude?

655
00:24:09,057 --> 00:24:10,190
- 'Tude? Really?
- No, I'm...

656
00:24:10,192 --> 00:24:12,158
You haven't even seen
the beginning of this attitude.

657
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,160
- Oh, I-I...
- Wait, say that to me again.

658
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:15,195
I apologize.

659
00:24:15,197 --> 00:24:16,596
That was a poor choice
of words.

660
00:24:16,598 --> 00:24:19,132
I just mean I need you
to show me the respect

661
00:24:19,134 --> 00:24:20,900
that you would show your boss.

662
00:24:20,902 --> 00:24:22,235
Because this is your house,
right?

663
00:24:22,237 --> 00:24:23,869
Oh, you... you did the
black voice thing with him?

664
00:24:23,871 --> 00:24:25,071
It's not a black voice.

665
00:24:25,073 --> 00:24:27,039
In actuality,
not a black voice.

666
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:28,475
No, you do a black voice.

667
00:24:28,477 --> 00:24:30,043
You don't remember when
you was in that meeting,

668
00:24:30,045 --> 00:24:31,845
you was like, "We gonna
get it lit up in here.

669
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:32,846
This meeting lit!"

670
00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:33,947
It was very lit.

671
00:24:33,949 --> 00:24:35,215
You did it at the staff meeting

672
00:24:35,217 --> 00:24:37,517
when you were like,
"I keep it one hundred."

673
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:39,051
When have I never kept it
one hunnid?

674
00:24:39,053 --> 00:24:42,155
When you added that AP Calculus
to my class load.

675
00:24:42,157 --> 00:24:44,557
All right, agree to disagree.
Listen, I hate to break up

676
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,993
this pleasure party
of delusion,

677
00:24:46,995 --> 00:24:48,361
but I have work to do.

678
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:50,299
- Wow.
- So, if you'll excuse me...

679
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,067
I'm-a do my thang.

680
00:24:55,904 --> 00:24:58,371
That's... that's a black voice.

681
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:00,373
Look alive, people!

682
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:03,142
Let's move with purpose!
Go, go, go, go, go!

683
00:25:03,144 --> 00:25:05,045
- Hey. Hey.
- No loitering in my hall!

684
00:25:05,047 --> 00:25:07,614
Can... can he really do that?
Can he keep me from going here?

685
00:25:07,616 --> 00:25:10,883
No, he can't. As a matter
of fact, here's a textbook.

686
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:12,951
I'm actually going to set up
the class right now

687
00:25:12,953 --> 00:25:14,887
for our first session
of the semester.

688
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:16,255
We start at 7:00.

689
00:25:16,257 --> 00:25:18,291
Yeah, but this-this book
is just kind of thick.

690
00:25:18,293 --> 00:25:21,096
I thought it
would be more like a leaflet.

691
00:25:24,098 --> 00:25:26,265
You thought you could cram
four years of high school

692
00:25:26,267 --> 00:25:27,366
into a leaflet?

693
00:25:27,368 --> 00:25:28,534
- No.
- Maybe you are

694
00:25:28,536 --> 00:25:30,904
- as dumb as Stewart says.
- Wait, wait, no, no, no, no.

695
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:32,038
No, no, I didn't...
I didn't think that.

696
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,273
- Go to the library, then.
- I just...

697
00:25:33,275 --> 00:25:34,474
- I'll hold on...
- Little scrawny midget!

698
00:25:34,476 --> 00:25:36,141
I'll hold on to it.

699
00:25:36,143 --> 00:25:37,910
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm trippin'.

700
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:40,012
I'm thinking along the lines
of traffic school.

701
00:25:40,014 --> 00:25:42,048
Look, come or not...
makes me no difference.

702
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:44,016
I don't get paid by the head.

703
00:25:44,018 --> 00:25:45,951
Or maybe you can find
a night school

704
00:25:45,953 --> 00:25:47,587
that does teach from a leaflet.

705
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:49,254
You-you know of one that...?

706
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,624
No, no, no.
I'm-I'm gonna keep it.

707
00:25:52,193 --> 00:25:53,460
Have a good one.

708
00:25:53,462 --> 00:25:56,496
<i>Marv, I do not know
about this GED thing.</i>

709
00:25:56,498 --> 00:25:58,465
I don't, man.
The teacher is tough as hell.

710
00:25:58,467 --> 00:26:00,232
Hold on.
Marv, let me hit you back.

711
00:26:00,234 --> 00:26:01,233
Yo!

712
00:26:01,235 --> 00:26:02,501
Oh, shit!

713
00:26:02,503 --> 00:26:04,403
Hold up! Stop, stop!

714
00:26:04,405 --> 00:26:06,473
- What you doing?
- What's it look like I'm doing?

715
00:26:06,475 --> 00:26:08,508
Uh, it look like
you towing my car.

716
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,075
Did I park in a handicap spot?

717
00:26:10,077 --> 00:26:11,644
You've missed the last four
payments on that car.

718
00:26:11,646 --> 00:26:12,712
It's getting repossessed.

719
00:26:12,714 --> 00:26:14,680
You gonna take my car
with my baby in the back?

720
00:26:14,682 --> 00:26:16,982
Don't see no goddamn baby
in there.

721
00:26:16,984 --> 00:26:20,152
The baby right there.

722
00:26:20,154 --> 00:26:22,454
- You don't hear that?
- I don't think so.

723
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:24,425
Hey, man, I said don't do it.

724
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:26,959
I'm not playing.

725
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:28,060
Get out of the way, dude.

726
00:26:28,062 --> 00:26:29,562
Stop, man.

727
00:26:29,564 --> 00:26:30,697
I got my baby in here!

728
00:26:30,699 --> 00:26:32,465
The car is leaving.

729
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:34,099
- Get out of the way, dude.
- I'll show you leaving.

730
00:26:34,101 --> 00:26:35,567
- Come on, man.
- I've got something for your ass.

731
00:26:35,569 --> 00:26:37,436
Get out of the car.

732
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:43,976
- You want to play that game?
- Yeah!

733
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:46,113
- You want to see something?
- Come on, then!

734
00:26:49,283 --> 00:26:50,416
Bye.

735
00:26:50,418 --> 00:26:51,450
Dumb-ass.

736
00:26:51,452 --> 00:26:52,719
Oh, God!

737
00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:56,488
Glad y'all enjoyed the show.

738
00:26:58,192 --> 00:27:01,160
Tell my fiancée
I got in another accident!

739
00:27:07,401 --> 00:27:09,268
Uh...

740
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,637
- Carrie, right?
- Oh.

741
00:27:11,639 --> 00:27:13,305
So, even though we got
textbook-sized textbooks,

742
00:27:13,307 --> 00:27:14,506
you decided to join us.

743
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:17,042
Well, grab a seat.

744
00:27:17,044 --> 00:27:18,545
We'll get started in a few.

745
00:27:18,547 --> 00:27:21,180
Uh, okay, before I do that...
now, I know we got off

746
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:23,182
on the wrong foot,
so I was thinking.

747
00:27:23,184 --> 00:27:25,451
I don't know... I don't know if
you had time for dinner or not,

748
00:27:25,453 --> 00:27:27,453
so I took it upon myself

749
00:27:27,455 --> 00:27:30,189
to go and get you one
of my personal favorites.

750
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:31,791
It's the best Mexican
here in the A.

751
00:27:31,793 --> 00:27:33,392
Oh. Thank you.

752
00:27:33,394 --> 00:27:35,327
That is so thoughtful
of you, Teddy.

753
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:37,663
So, check this out.

754
00:27:37,665 --> 00:27:39,398
I went through some of
your old high school records.

755
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,033
- Uh-huh.
- Math,

756
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:44,636
science, English...
you was a horrible student.

757
00:27:44,638 --> 00:27:46,271
What was going on
with you then?

758
00:27:46,273 --> 00:27:47,539
Was you being abused
or something?

759
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,140
Carrie, the thing with me

760
00:27:49,142 --> 00:27:51,443
is I prefer to use the world
as my classroom.

761
00:27:51,445 --> 00:27:54,646
And to be honest with you,
I'm not a...

762
00:27:54,648 --> 00:27:57,182
I'm not like the rest
of these folks.

763
00:27:57,184 --> 00:28:00,219
I'm just not what you would
call a night school person.

764
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:03,354
So I figure, maybe you and I
can look out for one another.

765
00:28:03,356 --> 00:28:05,190
You help me, I help you.

766
00:28:05,192 --> 00:28:06,725
You got my back,
I got your back.

767
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:08,727
Whatever, but it's just
a conversation.

768
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,829
So enjoy your tacos.

769
00:28:10,831 --> 00:28:13,434
That smile can light up a room,
can't it?

770
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:19,607
I ain't going there.

771
00:28:36,457 --> 00:28:39,158
Remember me, <i>pendejo?</i>

772
00:28:44,498 --> 00:28:47,098
Well, if it isn't Pubey McGee.

773
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,601
The cheesecake puber
is here, huh?

774
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:51,202
Surprised to see me, bro?

775
00:28:51,204 --> 00:28:53,238
You shouldn't be, considering
that you got me fired.

776
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,174
- I did not get you fired.
- Yes, you did.

777
00:28:56,176 --> 00:28:57,409
I worked in customer service

778
00:28:57,411 --> 00:28:58,844
for a long time.
Everybody knows that

779
00:28:58,846 --> 00:29:00,879
the customer is always right.

780
00:29:00,881 --> 00:29:03,648
- Tips are my livelihood.
- I had a 20 coming your way.

781
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,350
The bill was $800.

782
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:07,819
I had a buck sixty
coming to me, man.

783
00:29:07,821 --> 00:29:09,688
- Okay. That's your fault.
- Okay, let's begin.

784
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,723
Who here likes tacos?

785
00:29:11,725 --> 00:29:13,892
- Oh! Oh, oh.
- Ooh!

786
00:29:13,894 --> 00:29:16,294
They vegetarian?

787
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,530
'Cause I don't eat meat
unless it's barbecue.

788
00:29:18,532 --> 00:29:20,197
Let's see what Teddy
brought us.

789
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:22,400
Uh, we got carne asada.

790
00:29:22,402 --> 00:29:23,635
There you go.

791
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,169
There's, uh, al pastor.

792
00:29:25,171 --> 00:29:26,504
- Oh, thanks.
- You... you like that? Um...

793
00:29:26,506 --> 00:29:27,705
Carnitas? You like carnitas?

794
00:29:27,707 --> 00:29:29,141
- There you go, girl.
- Ooh!

795
00:29:29,143 --> 00:29:30,742
- Uh... uh, excuse me.
- Hey!

796
00:29:30,744 --> 00:29:33,779
Carrie, I-I had actually got
those tacos for you to eat.

797
00:29:33,781 --> 00:29:35,179
I know.

798
00:29:35,181 --> 00:29:37,348
See, class, Teddy went to...

799
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:40,184
Cactus House
to try to win me over.

800
00:29:40,186 --> 00:29:41,453
But here's the deal, Teddy.

801
00:29:41,455 --> 00:29:43,321
If you're trying
to kiss my ass,

802
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,323
you're gonna have to come
a little bit better than that.

803
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,925
I'm talking, like,
steamed lobster

804
00:29:46,927 --> 00:29:48,894
inside a macaroni and cheese,

805
00:29:48,896 --> 00:29:50,595
with a side of broccolini.

806
00:29:50,597 --> 00:29:52,664
You know what I'm saying?
Something fancy.

807
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,666
Not no fast food place
where I could

808
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:56,802
go buy this with my own
little raggedy paycheck.

809
00:29:56,804 --> 00:29:58,737
Well, there's actually a...

810
00:29:58,739 --> 00:30:00,771
there's actually
a special guacamole...

811
00:30:00,773 --> 00:30:04,543
If you want to succeed
in my class,

812
00:30:04,545 --> 00:30:05,811
you need to do the work.

813
00:30:05,813 --> 00:30:07,178
It's just that simple.

814
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,512
- Yes?
- Uh, quick question.

815
00:30:08,514 --> 00:30:11,349
Uh, so "yes"
on the steamed lobster?

816
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,317
No, sir.

817
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:15,853
That's what I like to call
"a teachable moment."

818
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:18,557
Okay, so no lobster.

819
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,659
Um, all right, let's go ahead
and do some introductions.

820
00:30:21,661 --> 00:30:22,793
I'll start.

821
00:30:22,795 --> 00:30:24,195
My name is Carrie.

822
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,630
During the day, I teach

823
00:30:25,632 --> 00:30:27,632
way too many classes
for way too little money.

824
00:30:27,634 --> 00:30:30,468
So I'm here to try to make
a little extra cash

825
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:34,872
so I can afford such luxuries
as rent and antibiotics.

826
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:38,242
'Cause this job makes me sick
sometimes.

827
00:30:38,244 --> 00:30:40,343
Uh, you're next.

828
00:30:40,345 --> 00:30:42,246
Yes, you.

829
00:30:42,248 --> 00:30:44,248
As-salaam alaikum.

830
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,683
What up, though?

831
00:30:45,685 --> 00:30:47,551
Jaylen's the name.

832
00:30:47,553 --> 00:30:49,587
I've been working
for the last 14 years

833
00:30:49,589 --> 00:30:50,955
at the MacArthur Bottling Plant

834
00:30:50,957 --> 00:30:52,660
and just got replaced
by a robot.

835
00:30:53,994 --> 00:30:55,861
And my rib, my Cleopatra,

836
00:30:55,863 --> 00:30:57,762
my queen, my bottom bitch,

837
00:30:57,764 --> 00:31:00,498
my wife of 14 years,
she was like, "Yo,

838
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,967
"if you want options,
you gonna have to get your GED.

839
00:31:02,969 --> 00:31:04,803
"It's either that
or end up cleaning rooms

840
00:31:04,805 --> 00:31:07,605
at the Best Western
for half your salary."

841
00:31:07,607 --> 00:31:09,640
And if you know Jay,
that ain't gonna work.

842
00:31:09,642 --> 00:31:12,643
Hey, let me...
let me just say this,

843
00:31:12,645 --> 00:31:14,979
okay, while I got the platform.

844
00:31:14,981 --> 00:31:18,616
For me, I first got woke
when I seen <i>Terminator,</i>

845
00:31:18,618 --> 00:31:22,386
and I realized
it wasn't just a movie;

846
00:31:22,388 --> 00:31:23,788
it was prophecy.

847
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:26,524
First identified
by the 3.5-Percenters,

848
00:31:26,526 --> 00:31:27,792
but that's another
conversation.

849
00:31:27,794 --> 00:31:29,627
Let's just put it like this.

850
00:31:29,629 --> 00:31:31,829
The revolution
will not be roboticized.

851
00:31:31,831 --> 00:31:33,431
Mm-hmm.

852
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,865
Not on Jay's watch.

853
00:31:34,867 --> 00:31:36,567
Huh?

854
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:38,568
Real nigga shit.

855
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:39,770
- Huh?
- Thank you, Jaylen.

856
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,372
I'll make sure
I don't bring my Roomba

857
00:31:41,374 --> 00:31:42,473
to the next class.

858
00:31:42,475 --> 00:31:44,909
My wife takes rumba classes.

859
00:31:44,911 --> 00:31:46,811
- I don't get it.
- Let's keep it moving.

860
00:31:46,813 --> 00:31:48,411
Uh, how about you, ma'am?

861
00:31:48,413 --> 00:31:49,914
- Yeah.
- Oh.

862
00:31:49,916 --> 00:31:51,514
Okay. Hi, gang.

863
00:31:51,516 --> 00:31:52,783
My name is Theresa,

864
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:54,618
and I dropped out
of high school

865
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,654
when I was pregnant
with my first child.

866
00:31:56,656 --> 00:31:58,489
My now-husband, Randy,

867
00:31:58,491 --> 00:32:00,423
well, we got married
after he knocked me up.

868
00:32:00,425 --> 00:32:01,859
Then we had two more kids,
so we have

869
00:32:01,861 --> 00:32:03,626
three little rascals now,
and it's fun.

870
00:32:03,628 --> 00:32:05,362
We're just a little underwater

871
00:32:05,364 --> 00:32:07,765
right now, so I wanted
to get my GED and hopefully

872
00:32:07,767 --> 00:32:10,300
enter the workforce
before it's too late

873
00:32:10,302 --> 00:32:12,672
and we have to live in
Randy's parents' laundry room.

874
00:32:18,544 --> 00:32:20,377
I'm blessed.

875
00:32:20,379 --> 00:32:21,812
So blessed.

876
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,513
God is good.

877
00:32:23,515 --> 00:32:25,548
That's what's up.

878
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,951
Uh, how about you, young lady?

879
00:32:26,953 --> 00:32:28,586
Oh.

880
00:32:28,588 --> 00:32:30,855
Hey, uh, what's up?
I'm Mila.

881
00:32:30,857 --> 00:32:32,690
I got kicked out
of my high school

882
00:32:32,692 --> 00:32:34,324
because they found
some Molly in my locker.

883
00:32:34,326 --> 00:32:35,760
- Mm-hmm.
- And I can avoid juvie

884
00:32:35,762 --> 00:32:38,428
if I get my GED, so here I am.

885
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,664
- I'm so psyched.
- Cool.

886
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:43,801
Look at you, all cute,
making America great again.

887
00:32:43,803 --> 00:32:46,402
Bitch.

888
00:32:46,404 --> 00:32:47,872
So, what's your story, guy?

889
00:32:47,874 --> 00:32:50,107
Um, my name is Luis Flores.

890
00:32:50,109 --> 00:32:52,375
I had a great job as a waiter.

891
00:32:52,377 --> 00:32:54,345
Lot of money in tips.

892
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,981
Until I was fired
without cause.

893
00:32:56,983 --> 00:32:58,716
No reason at all.

894
00:32:58,718 --> 00:33:00,285
Fired.

895
00:33:01,653 --> 00:33:03,453
I don't know why...
I have no idea

896
00:33:03,455 --> 00:33:04,889
why he's looking at me.
I don't...

897
00:33:04,891 --> 00:33:06,423
It's fine.

898
00:33:06,425 --> 00:33:07,792
It's just a sign that it's time

899
00:33:07,794 --> 00:33:09,126
for me to do
something different.

900
00:33:09,128 --> 00:33:10,760
You see,
I came to this country

901
00:33:10,762 --> 00:33:12,562
from Mexico
to fulfill my dream

902
00:33:12,564 --> 00:33:13,797
of being a singer/songwriter.

903
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:15,532
Oh, like Julio Iglesias?

904
00:33:15,534 --> 00:33:18,035
No, not like Julio Iglesias.

905
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,737
He sucks.

906
00:33:19,739 --> 00:33:22,039
More like Justin Bieber

907
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:25,608
or Justin Timberlake
or T-Pain.

908
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:28,813
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

909
00:33:28,815 --> 00:33:31,816
Aren't you a little old
to, like, be a pop star now?

910
00:33:31,818 --> 00:33:33,451
Aren't you a little young
to die?

911
00:33:35,121 --> 00:33:37,154
That's what's up.

912
00:33:37,156 --> 00:33:40,991
But now I'm going to become
a dental "hy-enist."

913
00:33:40,993 --> 00:33:43,894
'Cause I have great teeth.

914
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,895
So I think I'd be a natural.

915
00:33:45,897 --> 00:33:47,564
A what?

916
00:33:47,566 --> 00:33:49,467
Dental hy-enist.

917
00:33:50,702 --> 00:33:52,101
Maybe you should see one.

918
00:33:52,103 --> 00:33:55,638
'Cause, you know what,
pretty stinky, guys.

919
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,974
All right. Hey, everybody.

920
00:33:56,976 --> 00:33:58,175
I'm Mackenzie.

921
00:33:58,177 --> 00:33:59,809
Uh, they call me Big Mac.

922
00:33:59,811 --> 00:34:01,678
Oh, we love McDonald's.

923
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,946
What?

924
00:34:02,948 --> 00:34:05,049
McDonald's?

925
00:34:05,051 --> 00:34:06,683
I'm sorry, what?

926
00:34:06,685 --> 00:34:08,620
From the burger joint,
Mickey D's.

927
00:34:09,888 --> 00:34:11,423
Ronald McDonald's.

928
00:34:12,691 --> 00:34:13,923
"Two all-beef patties,

929
00:34:13,925 --> 00:34:15,524
"special sauce,
lettuce, cheese,

930
00:34:15,526 --> 00:34:17,761
- on a sesame-seed bun."
- Hmm.

931
00:34:17,763 --> 00:34:19,629
Never heard of it?

932
00:34:22,567 --> 00:34:25,869
Ooh, it's gonna be
a long semester.

933
00:34:25,871 --> 00:34:28,171
- Go on.
- Well, anyway,

934
00:34:28,173 --> 00:34:32,508
uh, my knees and my back
are really jacked up

935
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:35,011
from working at He-Man Movers
for 30 years,

936
00:34:35,013 --> 00:34:38,815
so I decided to get my GED
so that I could move up

937
00:34:38,817 --> 00:34:41,218
to a management position,
get off the truck.

938
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,820
And my son...
we call him Little Mac...

939
00:34:43,822 --> 00:34:45,822
he has decided
to drop out of school.

940
00:34:45,824 --> 00:34:48,625
So I made a deal with him:
I get my GED,

941
00:34:48,627 --> 00:34:50,193
he gets his diploma.

942
00:34:51,595 --> 00:34:53,630
Little reverse psychology.

943
00:34:53,632 --> 00:34:55,031
All right.

944
00:34:55,033 --> 00:34:56,566
And what's your name?

945
00:34:56,568 --> 00:34:58,234
Hey, yo, what up? I'm Bobby.

946
00:34:58,236 --> 00:35:00,069
That's what...
that's what I'm talking about.

947
00:35:00,071 --> 00:35:02,906
That's Illuminati.
That's what I'm saying.

948
00:35:02,908 --> 00:35:04,807
See, the nigga here,
but he ain't here.

949
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:06,643
It's like they watching you,

950
00:35:06,645 --> 00:35:08,245
and you think
you watching them.

951
00:35:08,247 --> 00:35:09,479
That's what they do.

952
00:35:09,481 --> 00:35:11,014
So you got Bobby Digital.

953
00:35:11,016 --> 00:35:12,849
He here, but he not.

954
00:35:12,851 --> 00:35:14,217
That's Tupac Coachella.

955
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:15,251
You know what I'm saying?

956
00:35:15,253 --> 00:35:17,121
And he in the... You see?

957
00:35:17,123 --> 00:35:19,223
- Y'all don't...?
- All right, um...

958
00:35:19,225 --> 00:35:21,591
That probably ain't even
a real nigga. Hey.

959
00:35:21,593 --> 00:35:23,793
Are you on crack?
It's-it's Skype.

960
00:35:23,795 --> 00:35:26,595
Whew, boy,
it's hard to be woke.

961
00:35:27,731 --> 00:35:29,168
It's hard to be woke.

962
00:35:30,502 --> 00:35:32,769
What is "woke"?

963
00:35:32,771 --> 00:35:35,672
Okay, well, welcome, everyone.

964
00:35:35,674 --> 00:35:36,773
Really nice. We've all met.

965
00:35:36,775 --> 00:35:38,207
Well, we didn't, uh...

966
00:35:38,209 --> 00:35:40,109
we didn't meet...
we didn't meet everyone.

967
00:35:40,111 --> 00:35:42,211
- I didn't, uh...
- Teddy, uh, earlier,

968
00:35:42,213 --> 00:35:44,047
you said, unlike these folks,

969
00:35:44,049 --> 00:35:46,548
you're not a night school
type of person,

970
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:49,551
so I didn't think you cared.

971
00:35:49,553 --> 00:35:51,187
Is that right?

972
00:35:51,189 --> 00:35:53,122
Well, you didn't...

973
00:35:53,124 --> 00:35:55,291
you didn't hear it right,
'cause I would never say that

974
00:35:55,293 --> 00:35:57,260
about people that I don't know.

975
00:35:57,262 --> 00:35:59,162
You know what?
This is a perfect segue.

976
00:35:59,164 --> 00:36:01,530
I'll just follow your lead,
and I'll stand up.

977
00:36:01,532 --> 00:36:03,031
I am Teddy Walker.

978
00:36:03,033 --> 00:36:06,002
Uh, a little fun fact about me:
I actually went here.

979
00:36:06,004 --> 00:36:08,738
- Oh.
- I'm also newly engaged.

980
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,605
His fiancée is out
of his league.

981
00:36:10,607 --> 00:36:11,740
I'm sorry, what?

982
00:36:11,742 --> 00:36:12,841
Nothing. You're doing great.

983
00:36:12,843 --> 00:36:14,110
I said, "Keep going.

984
00:36:14,112 --> 00:36:15,811
Everybody loves you."

985
00:36:15,813 --> 00:36:17,613
How does
your fiancée feel about

986
00:36:17,615 --> 00:36:18,614
you being in night school?

987
00:36:18,616 --> 00:36:19,782
Oh, she good.

988
00:36:19,784 --> 00:36:21,918
She loves it.

989
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,919
He ain't told her shit.

990
00:36:23,921 --> 00:36:25,121
She loves it.

991
00:36:25,123 --> 00:36:26,655
I noticed that your voice

992
00:36:26,657 --> 00:36:28,156
just went up a whole octave.

993
00:36:28,158 --> 00:36:31,626
Now, from my studies
of psychology in grad school,

994
00:36:31,628 --> 00:36:34,563
I know that that means
that you're bullshitting.

995
00:36:34,565 --> 00:36:35,931
Ain't no bullshit in me.

996
00:36:35,933 --> 00:36:37,899
I tell you what...
if you're lying with her,

997
00:36:37,901 --> 00:36:40,068
- don't lie to her.
- But I don't... I don't lie.

998
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,738
Sound like some bullshit to me.

999
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,006
Everyone sees
right through you.

1000
00:36:43,008 --> 00:36:44,573
- Okay, how about we...?
- Mm-hmm.

1001
00:36:44,575 --> 00:36:46,641
If we go by your theory
about the voice thing...

1002
00:36:46,643 --> 00:36:47,976
I think that we're...
I think that we're all

1003
00:36:47,978 --> 00:36:49,278
- getting off track.
- ...he's lied four times.

1004
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,079
This boy definitely lying.

1005
00:36:51,081 --> 00:36:53,116
- I am not.
- You can't outsmart Mother Nature.

1006
00:36:53,118 --> 00:36:54,350
And that's what...
that-that's what a woman is.

1007
00:36:54,352 --> 00:36:56,685
- Brother.
- Especially a black woman.

1008
00:36:56,687 --> 00:36:57,987
- You know, how...
- That's correct.

1009
00:36:57,989 --> 00:36:59,921
- Girls are smart, dude.
- Goddamn it.

1010
00:36:59,923 --> 00:37:00,756
Like, literally, damn it.

1011
00:37:00,758 --> 00:37:02,624
Even if he didn't tell her,
so what?

1012
00:37:02,626 --> 00:37:03,692
- Okay, here's the thing.
- I told Randy

1013
00:37:03,694 --> 00:37:05,762
that he was the first guy
I slept with... not true.

1014
00:37:05,764 --> 00:37:07,330
Hey, I'm trying to introduce
myself, and I can't...

1015
00:37:07,332 --> 00:37:09,198
You don't respect your queen,
'cause if you did,

1016
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,866
- that bitch would know where you at.
- Okay.

1017
00:37:10,868 --> 00:37:12,268
Teddy.

1018
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,235
Don't lie to your queen.

1019
00:37:13,237 --> 00:37:14,369
- Okay, guys.
- If you're busting off

1020
00:37:14,371 --> 00:37:17,140
in her guts like that,
she might be carrying your seed.

1021
00:37:17,142 --> 00:37:18,274
I feel like
this conversation...

1022
00:37:18,276 --> 00:37:19,841
So you ain't just lying to her;
you lying to your child.

1023
00:37:19,843 --> 00:37:21,044
- Shit!
- If it's your bottom bitch,

1024
00:37:21,046 --> 00:37:22,044
she know you stupid, fam.

1025
00:37:22,046 --> 00:37:24,046
- All I'm saying, fam, look-look...
- Forget it.

1026
00:37:24,048 --> 00:37:26,114
- Okay.
- How your fiancée don't know where you at?

1027
00:37:26,116 --> 00:37:27,682
It's after dark.

1028
00:37:27,684 --> 00:37:28,851
This ain't Halloween, fam.

1029
00:37:28,853 --> 00:37:29,986
I'm done.

1030
00:37:29,988 --> 00:37:32,221
My sister know
where I'm at, okay?

1031
00:37:32,223 --> 00:37:34,623
And she live all the way
in Arkansas.

1032
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:36,825
Okay. Here's the deal, class.

1033
00:37:36,827 --> 00:37:39,728
You will be given homework
every night

1034
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,197
just like regular high school.

1035
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:42,764
And now...

1036
00:37:42,766 --> 00:37:44,267
a pop quiz

1037
00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:47,936
just so I can get a better idea
of where you all are.

1038
00:37:47,938 --> 00:37:50,005
Wait, wait. We got a...
we got a test on the first day?

1039
00:37:50,007 --> 00:37:53,109
Teddy, it's a pop quiz, okay?

1040
00:37:53,111 --> 00:37:54,410
Look here, folks.

1041
00:37:54,412 --> 00:37:57,879
I am here to teach
if you're here to learn.

1042
00:37:57,881 --> 00:38:01,416
Otherwise, you can get out
of my class right now.

1043
00:38:01,418 --> 00:38:03,285
That's what's up.

1044
00:38:03,287 --> 00:38:05,589
Welcome to night school.

1045
00:38:08,259 --> 00:38:10,659
There you go.

1046
00:38:10,661 --> 00:38:12,427
It was terrible, man.
Terrible!

1047
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:13,929
Like, she's not like
the teachers

1048
00:38:13,931 --> 00:38:15,330
that we had back in the day.

1049
00:38:15,332 --> 00:38:17,400
- What?
- This woman is a brick wall,

1050
00:38:17,402 --> 00:38:18,967
and I can't...
I can't work her.

1051
00:38:18,969 --> 00:38:21,236
I can't work a brick wall.

1052
00:38:21,238 --> 00:38:22,204
What are you...
what are you doing?

1053
00:38:22,206 --> 00:38:24,272
I'm working out.
I'm trying to shed some LBs.

1054
00:38:24,274 --> 00:38:26,674
- I want to feel fit.
- Uh, why am I even asking?

1055
00:38:26,676 --> 00:38:28,977
In the meantime, please stop
paying for everything,

1056
00:38:28,979 --> 00:38:31,447
and you have to get a temp job.

1057
00:38:31,449 --> 00:38:33,849
You don't think I've been looking for a job?

1058
00:38:33,851 --> 00:38:36,184
What are you, crazy?
I'm on a treadmill.

1059
00:38:36,186 --> 00:38:38,286
The jobs that I want,
they are not

1060
00:38:38,288 --> 00:38:40,755
going to give
to a high school dropout.

1061
00:38:40,757 --> 00:38:42,358
Well, you can't keep
lying to Lisa.

1062
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,559
Okay?
You know what, I'm gonna go

1063
00:38:43,561 --> 00:38:45,827
on Monster.com right now,
see if anything new popped up.

1064
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:48,063
What are you going...
what are you going to find

1065
00:38:48,065 --> 00:38:49,364
- on Monster.com?
- Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

1066
00:38:49,366 --> 00:38:50,965
Okay, here we go.
"Sales associate wanted.

1067
00:38:50,967 --> 00:38:52,968
Marketing skills a must."

1068
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:54,903
And... wait for it.

1069
00:38:54,905 --> 00:38:57,139
"No GED required."

1070
00:38:57,141 --> 00:38:59,241
You gotta jump on this, man.
This is perfect.

1071
00:39:14,458 --> 00:39:16,994
It's chicken from the Lord.

1072
00:39:18,095 --> 00:39:19,861
So he... so he made it?

1073
00:39:19,863 --> 00:39:21,331
Yes, sir, he did.

1074
00:39:22,499 --> 00:39:24,132
Yeah.

1075
00:39:24,134 --> 00:39:26,033
I-I can...
I can work with this.

1076
00:39:26,035 --> 00:39:28,136
- You can?
- Yeah.

1077
00:39:28,138 --> 00:39:30,038
Basically,
what you want to do...

1078
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,108
you want to... you want to
uplift your customers' palate.

1079
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,742
- Yes, sir.
- When they bite

1080
00:39:34,744 --> 00:39:36,877
into your food,
you want their taste buds

1081
00:39:36,879 --> 00:39:38,946
to scream out, "Hallelujah!"

1082
00:39:38,948 --> 00:39:40,115
Preach it, Brother Teddy.

1083
00:39:40,117 --> 00:39:41,449
You are a godsend.

1084
00:39:41,451 --> 00:39:43,018
I'm a salesman, man.

1085
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,386
That's what I do, okay?

1086
00:39:44,388 --> 00:39:46,787
Now, when it comes to titles,
I don't even care.

1087
00:39:46,789 --> 00:39:48,390
"Marketing director"...
that's up to you.

1088
00:39:48,392 --> 00:39:51,091
"WWJD," at this point.
"What would Jesus do?"

1089
00:39:51,093 --> 00:39:52,394
- Yes, sir.
- The one thing that I ask

1090
00:39:52,396 --> 00:39:53,929
is for you to be flexible
with the hours,

1091
00:39:53,931 --> 00:39:55,363
'cause I'm getting my GED.

1092
00:39:55,365 --> 00:39:57,165
You are bettering yourself,
Brother Teddy.

1093
00:39:57,167 --> 00:39:59,334
- Yeah.
- That's what being a Christian is all about.

1094
00:39:59,336 --> 00:40:01,135
Yeah, amen to that.

1095
00:40:01,137 --> 00:40:02,136
Amen.

1096
00:40:02,138 --> 00:40:03,706
- Yeah.
- Glory be.

1097
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:06,243
This should fit you perfectly.

1098
00:40:07,544 --> 00:40:08,543
Brother Teddy,

1099
00:40:08,545 --> 00:40:10,445
I have been waiting on the Lord

1100
00:40:10,447 --> 00:40:12,347
to bring me a pint-sized
little man like you

1101
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:15,818
to fill this out,
and here you are.

1102
00:40:17,187 --> 00:40:19,020
I'm-I'm not gonna do that.

1103
00:40:19,022 --> 00:40:22,089
Brother Isaac,
I-I'm a black man.

1104
00:40:22,091 --> 00:40:25,392
I can't put on
a chicken suit in 2018

1105
00:40:25,394 --> 00:40:27,928
and stand on the side
of a highway

1106
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:30,098
and hawk no goddamn chicken.

1107
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,566
Now, if the marketing position
isn't what you

1108
00:40:31,568 --> 00:40:32,933
had in mind, we can figure...

1109
00:40:32,935 --> 00:40:34,068
What is going on?

1110
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:36,203
You know what? We're gonna
have to put a pin in that.

1111
00:40:36,205 --> 00:40:37,938
- Is that a fire drill?
- All right, everybody.

1112
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,473
Let's gather round.
The hour is upon us.

1113
00:40:39,475 --> 00:40:40,976
Where's the closest exit?

1114
00:40:40,978 --> 00:40:43,044
- It is time to pray.
- It's time to what?

1115
00:40:43,046 --> 00:40:45,045
It's time to pray.
Gather round.

1116
00:40:45,047 --> 00:40:46,914
Goddamn. What is your deal?

1117
00:40:46,916 --> 00:40:49,216
- What's...? Hey, lady.
- Dear Lord: We thank you

1118
00:40:49,218 --> 00:40:50,484
for bringing little Teddy to us

1119
00:40:50,486 --> 00:40:51,819
- here this morning.
- Yes, sir.

1120
00:40:51,821 --> 00:40:53,021
This little chickadee...

1121
00:40:53,023 --> 00:40:54,222
- Huh?
- ...is gonna share the word

1122
00:40:54,224 --> 00:40:55,956
about your precious poultry
with the world.

1123
00:40:55,958 --> 00:40:57,891
What I'm not gonna do
is do it in...

1124
00:40:57,893 --> 00:40:59,260
Ma'am, ma'am.

1125
00:40:59,262 --> 00:41:01,295
Strong hands!

1126
00:41:01,297 --> 00:41:03,097
Excuse me!

1127
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:06,000
What I'm not gonna do is do it
in the chick... Goddamn.

1128
00:41:06,002 --> 00:41:07,101
Brother Teddy...

1129
00:41:07,103 --> 00:41:08,370
He's in you.

1130
00:41:08,372 --> 00:41:09,471
He's in you, ain't he?

1131
00:41:09,473 --> 00:41:10,871
Chicken suit or not,

1132
00:41:10,873 --> 00:41:12,506
we are all praying together
right now

1133
00:41:12,508 --> 00:41:14,842
that you're gonna find
your nest here with us today.

1134
00:41:14,844 --> 00:41:16,910
- Okay.
- Amen and amen.

1135
00:41:16,912 --> 00:41:19,179
Amen!

1136
00:41:19,181 --> 00:41:20,114
Amen. Yes, sir!

1137
00:41:20,116 --> 00:41:21,148
Welcome, Brother Teddy.

1138
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:23,183
All right, everybody,
this is a big day.

1139
00:41:23,185 --> 00:41:25,152
Hey, brother, let me holler
at you real quick.

1140
00:41:25,154 --> 00:41:26,453
Are y'all in the Sunken Place?

1141
00:41:26,455 --> 00:41:28,189
Let's share Jesus
through our food. Let's go.

1142
00:41:28,191 --> 00:41:29,591
The lunch rush is upon us.

1143
00:41:29,593 --> 00:41:30,991
What... lunch rush?

1144
00:41:30,993 --> 00:41:32,092
It's 10:00 a.m.

1145
00:41:32,094 --> 00:41:33,460
I don't understand

1146
00:41:33,462 --> 00:41:34,962
how that could be considered
a lunch rush.

1147
00:41:34,964 --> 00:41:36,597
Trust me, Brother Teddy.

1148
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:39,333
Okay, if there... if-if there's
any way that I can just talk

1149
00:41:39,335 --> 00:41:41,336
- to you about the...
- Good morning, ladies.

1150
00:41:41,338 --> 00:41:42,537
Hello, Cinnamon.

1151
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:43,538
Roxy.

1152
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,972
Hello, ladies.

1153
00:41:44,974 --> 00:41:46,307
Tootie, how was the shift?

1154
00:41:46,309 --> 00:41:47,875
Hollywood, how you doing?

1155
00:41:47,877 --> 00:41:49,443
Good to see you, Leigh.

1156
00:41:49,445 --> 00:41:51,111
Hello, Veronica,
how was your shift?

1157
00:41:51,113 --> 00:41:53,881
Roxy, good to see you.

1158
00:42:02,558 --> 00:42:04,592
<i>Now, from your first
night of homework,</i>

1159
00:42:04,594 --> 00:42:09,063
you all should be very familiar
with the Pythagorean theorem.

1160
00:42:09,065 --> 00:42:10,297
All right? Say it with me.

1161
00:42:10,299 --> 00:42:11,532
"Pythagorean..."

1162
00:42:11,534 --> 00:42:12,566
"Pythagorean."

1163
00:42:12,568 --> 00:42:13,567
"Pathygorinean."

1164
00:42:13,569 --> 00:42:14,967
- "Theorem."
- "Theorem."

1165
00:42:14,969 --> 00:42:16,103
- "Theorem."
- That's how you say it.

1166
00:42:16,105 --> 00:42:17,505
That's what it is.

1167
00:42:17,507 --> 00:42:19,973
Hey, yo, Bobby, watch out, fam!

1168
00:42:19,975 --> 00:42:22,009
- My God.
- Oh!

1169
00:42:22,011 --> 00:42:23,243
- What?!
- Ooh.

1170
00:42:23,245 --> 00:42:25,145
Oh!

1171
00:42:25,147 --> 00:42:27,981
Shit.

1172
00:42:27,983 --> 00:42:30,084
Can't you see
I'm trying to learn?

1173
00:42:30,086 --> 00:42:31,653
Someone ought to call the cops.

1174
00:42:31,655 --> 00:42:33,987
- What's happening?
- Take that!

1175
00:42:35,491 --> 00:42:37,224
- Ooh!
- Jesus.

1176
00:42:37,226 --> 00:42:38,925
Get off me! Get off me!

1177
00:42:38,927 --> 00:42:40,361
He's getting up, he's
getting up, he's getting up.

1178
00:42:40,363 --> 00:42:41,563
Watch out, fam!
Behind you, nigga!

1179
00:42:41,565 --> 00:42:43,430
- Oh, my God.
- Oh!

1180
00:42:43,432 --> 00:42:44,998
Oh, he just kicked him
in the...

1181
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,266
- Oh, my God!
- Oh!

1182
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:50,571
- Oh! Enough!
- Yeah! Yeah!

1183
00:42:50,573 --> 00:42:52,039
Finish him! Step on his head!

1184
00:42:53,209 --> 00:42:54,641
- Come here. Break it up.
- Come on!

1185
00:42:54,643 --> 00:42:56,643
Up!

1186
00:42:56,645 --> 00:42:58,412
- Hey, come on!
- Oh, hey, man!

1187
00:42:58,414 --> 00:42:59,513
I didn't do shit.

1188
00:42:59,515 --> 00:43:01,615
That's the stuff right there.

1189
00:43:01,617 --> 00:43:03,383
Reminds me of the old days.

1190
00:43:06,088 --> 00:43:08,455
They had the wrong guy.

1191
00:43:08,457 --> 00:43:10,224
- Please continue.
- You sure you cool,

1192
00:43:10,226 --> 00:43:11,658
or do we need to just chill

1193
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,627
and wait for you
to make a new shank?

1194
00:43:13,629 --> 00:43:17,030
Please continue
with the Pythagorean...

1195
00:43:17,032 --> 00:43:18,599
"theory-em."

1196
00:43:18,601 --> 00:43:21,068
O-Okay.

1197
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:22,736
You know what we
ought to do for Bobby?

1198
00:43:22,738 --> 00:43:25,204
We should get him, like,
some smokes,

1199
00:43:25,206 --> 00:43:26,740
'cause that stuff
is like currency in prison.

1200
00:43:26,742 --> 00:43:28,108
That and ass.

1201
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:29,443
Okay, here we go.

1202
00:43:29,445 --> 00:43:32,045
So, this is what we call
a right triangle.

1203
00:43:32,047 --> 00:43:35,549
And we already know the value
of two sides of the triangle.

1204
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:38,151
- Oh...
- That should make it very easy for us

1205
00:43:38,153 --> 00:43:40,554
- to calculate the hypotenuse.
- Mmm, mmm.

1206
00:43:40,556 --> 00:43:44,725
A-squared plus B-squared
equals C-squared.

1207
00:43:44,727 --> 00:43:46,092
Say that with me, guys.

1208
00:43:46,094 --> 00:43:48,762
A-squared plus B-squared

1209
00:43:48,764 --> 00:43:51,264
equals C-squared.

1210
00:43:51,266 --> 00:43:53,267
Very good. Uh, Teddy?

1211
00:43:53,269 --> 00:43:54,735
You seem to be getting
a real kick out of this.

1212
00:43:54,737 --> 00:43:56,770
She got you, Teddy!

1213
00:43:56,772 --> 00:43:59,105
You want to come up
and solve the problem?

1214
00:43:59,107 --> 00:44:00,542
Busted!

1215
00:44:03,178 --> 00:44:05,112
If, uh, that's what you...

1216
00:44:05,114 --> 00:44:07,381
if that's what you
want me to do.

1217
00:44:07,383 --> 00:44:08,315
Come on up.

1218
00:44:08,317 --> 00:44:09,716
Come on, Teddy.
You got this.

1219
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:12,351
You got this, Teddy.
Teddy!

1220
00:44:12,353 --> 00:44:14,187
Teddy! Teddy!

1221
00:44:14,189 --> 00:44:16,690
Teddy! Ted, Teddy, Teddy!

1222
00:44:24,032 --> 00:44:26,167
Find the value of C.

1223
00:44:39,347 --> 00:44:40,616
You know what?

1224
00:44:43,419 --> 00:44:45,552
I think there's something
in here.

1225
00:44:48,456 --> 00:44:51,426
Yo, yo, yo!
What up, my night school?

1226
00:44:52,528 --> 00:44:55,261
Who you looking for, fam?

1227
00:44:55,263 --> 00:44:57,129
I'm the principal
of this high school,

1228
00:44:57,131 --> 00:44:59,634
and I'm just dropping by
to check on...

1229
00:45:01,269 --> 00:45:02,702
What is he doing here?

1230
00:45:02,704 --> 00:45:05,772
I'm studying to get my GED,
like everybody else.

1231
00:45:05,774 --> 00:45:10,109
So, if you don't mind, I'd like
to get back to learning.

1232
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:13,479
Of course.

1233
00:45:13,481 --> 00:45:14,614
My apologies for interrupting.

1234
00:45:14,616 --> 00:45:16,148
Thank you.

1235
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:19,418
Actually,
I would like to observe

1236
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,354
for a minute, if that's okay.

1237
00:45:21,356 --> 00:45:24,524
Please, continue solving
the problem.

1238
00:45:24,526 --> 00:45:26,327
Forget I'm here.

1239
00:45:27,629 --> 00:45:28,664
Cool.

1240
00:45:29,765 --> 00:45:31,631
That's fine with me.

1241
00:45:31,633 --> 00:45:33,867
Okay, so if I'm gonna do this,

1242
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:35,868
let's do it step by step.
Let's make sure we do it right.

1243
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:38,504
First things first...
let's get rid of this line.

1244
00:45:39,775 --> 00:45:41,340
Because it's written sloppy.

1245
00:45:41,342 --> 00:45:43,242
- So let's get that baby in there.
- Eight.

1246
00:45:43,244 --> 00:45:44,277
Right?

1247
00:45:44,279 --> 00:45:45,411
- Huh.
- We got these three sides.

1248
00:45:45,413 --> 00:45:47,380
Got A, B, C. Let's split that.

1249
00:45:47,382 --> 00:45:48,581
That's there.

1250
00:45:48,583 --> 00:45:49,715
- Take these twos away.
- Mmm...

1251
00:45:49,717 --> 00:45:51,216
He don't know the answer.

1252
00:45:51,218 --> 00:45:53,252
Because that's what
confuses you.

1253
00:45:53,254 --> 00:45:56,188
And then...

1254
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:57,757
- I'm realizing what it is.
- Eight!

1255
00:45:57,759 --> 00:45:59,191
The answer's five.

1256
00:45:59,193 --> 00:46:00,459
It's five.

1257
00:46:00,461 --> 00:46:01,861
Easy.

1258
00:46:01,863 --> 00:46:03,897
Okay, you're looking
at five-squared.

1259
00:46:03,899 --> 00:46:06,165
Me up here, I don't have time.

1260
00:46:06,167 --> 00:46:08,367
I don't have time.
Why do I even waste my time?

1261
00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:09,802
I don't have
time to waste my time

1262
00:46:09,804 --> 00:46:11,203
on the Pythagorean theorem.
It's simple.

1263
00:46:11,205 --> 00:46:12,438
- It's simple.
- Wow.

1264
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,575
That is very impressive, Teddy.

1265
00:46:15,577 --> 00:46:17,376
Very impressive.

1266
00:46:17,378 --> 00:46:20,479
I look forward to seeing
how you do on the midterm.

1267
00:46:20,481 --> 00:46:21,881
My midterm.

1268
00:46:21,883 --> 00:46:23,749
All right.

1269
00:46:23,751 --> 00:46:25,585
Are we done here, Stewart,

1270
00:46:25,587 --> 00:46:28,621
or do you want to teach the
rest of the class for tonight?

1271
00:46:28,623 --> 00:46:30,256
Carry on, Carrie.

1272
00:46:30,258 --> 00:46:32,258
I don't like his attitude.

1273
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,161
You all have a wonderful class.

1274
00:46:35,396 --> 00:46:37,797
- Oy!
- What?

1275
00:46:37,799 --> 00:46:40,499
God, that guy is a douchebag.

1276
00:46:40,501 --> 00:46:42,401
Are we just gonna gloss
over the fact

1277
00:46:42,403 --> 00:46:44,737
that we just watched
a prison fight?

1278
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:46,806
How many classes do we have left?

1279
00:46:46,808 --> 00:46:49,574
I actually have to work
for four hours right now.

1280
00:46:49,576 --> 00:46:52,812
I can give you a ride home
for ten bucks, if you want.

1281
00:46:52,814 --> 00:46:54,647
Hey, Carrie. Hey.

1282
00:46:55,883 --> 00:46:57,650
That was real cool what you did

1283
00:46:57,652 --> 00:46:59,351
for me in there
at the blackboard.

1284
00:46:59,353 --> 00:47:00,352
You know, that's what
I was talking about

1285
00:47:00,354 --> 00:47:01,887
when I just say
"watching out for each other."

1286
00:47:01,889 --> 00:47:04,557
You know, you scratch my back,
I'll scratch yours?

1287
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:06,559
Oh, there's not gonna be any
more back-scratching, Teddy.

1288
00:47:06,561 --> 00:47:08,761
That's the last time
that happens.

1289
00:47:08,763 --> 00:47:11,764
And what was really going on
with you at the board anyways?

1290
00:47:11,766 --> 00:47:12,765
Nothing.

1291
00:47:12,767 --> 00:47:14,332
Nothing.

1292
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:16,569
No, I was just...
I wasn't prepared.

1293
00:47:16,571 --> 00:47:18,638
If you're not gonna
do the work, drop the class.

1294
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,772
Why would you...?
No, Carrie.

1295
00:47:19,774 --> 00:47:21,741
Hey, I'm gonna do the work.

1296
00:47:21,743 --> 00:47:23,341
- You'll see.
- We'll see.

1297
00:47:23,343 --> 00:47:25,443
- Yes, we will.
- Great.

1298
00:47:25,445 --> 00:47:26,946
- Superb.
- Excellent.

1299
00:47:26,948 --> 00:47:28,347
- Good.
- Mm-hmm.

1300
00:47:34,789 --> 00:47:36,688
Shit.

1301
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,759
<i>Honey, I'm home.</i>

1302
00:47:42,997 --> 00:47:44,699
You sleeping?

1303
00:47:45,867 --> 00:47:47,467
You up?

1304
00:47:57,344 --> 00:47:59,411
Excuse me.

1305
00:47:59,413 --> 00:48:01,346
Booty look good, don't it?

1306
00:48:01,348 --> 00:48:03,849
Too bad your face gonna be
in between them books

1307
00:48:03,851 --> 00:48:05,518
and not them cheeks.

1308
00:48:07,021 --> 00:48:08,388
Go study.

1309
00:48:10,557 --> 00:48:11,591
I don't want to study.

1310
00:48:12,859 --> 00:48:14,459
Mmm.

1311
00:48:17,532 --> 00:48:19,865
Come on, Teddy. Focus.

1312
00:48:19,867 --> 00:48:21,299
Focus, Teddy.

1313
00:48:21,301 --> 00:48:22,436
Focus!

1314
00:48:25,772 --> 00:48:27,505
You'll never get it!

1315
00:48:27,507 --> 00:48:29,475
Give it back!

1316
00:48:29,477 --> 00:48:31,609
<i>Hey, guys, this is my demo.</i>

1317
00:48:31,611 --> 00:48:33,511

1318
00:48:33,513 --> 00:48:35,447

1319
00:48:35,449 --> 00:48:36,715
♪ I'm fighting...

1320
00:48:38,618 --> 00:48:40,786
Little Mac! What are you doing?

1321
00:48:40,788 --> 00:48:42,320
That's my phone.
Those were my notes.

1322
00:48:42,322 --> 00:48:43,555
You should be studying.

1323
00:48:43,557 --> 00:48:45,925
What the hell?
Don't be such a dick.

1324
00:48:45,927 --> 00:48:47,292
- You're gonna study!
- I hate you!

1325
00:48:48,628 --> 00:48:49,928
What's the circumference
of that pizza?

1326
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:50,929
The diameter.

1327
00:48:50,931 --> 00:48:53,498
Just tell me, how many
pepperonis on the pizza?

1328
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,599
I'm giving you one star.

1329
00:48:54,601 --> 00:48:56,668
I'm gonna drop you off here
in a bad neighborhood.

1330
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:57,769
How about that?

1331
00:48:57,771 --> 00:48:59,637
Theresa!

1332
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:01,005
It's after 10:00. Hello!

1333
00:49:01,007 --> 00:49:02,372
That's my Randy.

1334
00:49:02,374 --> 00:49:03,943
Sweetest guy on earth.

1335
00:49:03,945 --> 00:49:06,078
Does anybody else want to try
to take a crack at this?

1336
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,379
- I'm kind of busy right now.
- Mmm!

1337
00:49:08,381 --> 00:49:10,014
Babe, you seen my Wite-Out?

1338
00:49:10,016 --> 00:49:12,016
What the...? Oh, hell no.

1339
00:49:12,018 --> 00:49:13,618
Trina.

1340
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:16,789
What-what-what-what,
you got robotic side dick now?

1341
00:49:16,791 --> 00:49:18,690
"Fat asses."

1342
00:49:18,692 --> 00:49:20,759
You know what fat asses like?

1343
00:49:20,761 --> 00:49:22,427
Dudes that have a real job.

1344
00:49:22,429 --> 00:49:24,362
- Teddy!
- Get your ass out.

1345
00:49:24,364 --> 00:49:26,530
Teddy, if you don't pass
that midterm,

1346
00:49:26,532 --> 00:49:28,433
no way homegirl stays with you.

1347
00:49:28,435 --> 00:49:29,869
Huh?

1348
00:49:29,871 --> 00:49:31,603
Think about that.

1349
00:49:31,605 --> 00:49:32,971
We're gonna have
to steal the test.

1350
00:49:32,973 --> 00:49:33,972
Whoa.

1351
00:49:33,974 --> 00:49:35,440
Mind meld.

1352
00:49:35,442 --> 00:49:36,875
I was thinking
the exact same thing.

1353
00:49:36,877 --> 00:49:38,442
If we being real with it,

1354
00:49:38,444 --> 00:49:40,012
I need as much help
as I can get.

1355
00:49:40,014 --> 00:49:42,981
Going from capping bottles
to hypotenuses and all that,

1356
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:45,483
I'm just as confounded
by the material

1357
00:49:45,485 --> 00:49:47,685
as the rest of y'all.
Feel me?

1358
00:49:47,687 --> 00:49:50,587
I really hate to admit it,
but with the language barrier

1359
00:49:50,589 --> 00:49:53,125
and all the Lyft driving
I've been doing,

1360
00:49:53,127 --> 00:49:54,926
I'm struggling as well, guys.

1361
00:49:54,928 --> 00:49:57,764
I think a caper sounds fun.

1362
00:49:59,499 --> 00:50:01,132
When'd you get here, Theresa?

1363
00:50:01,134 --> 00:50:03,001
Oh, I've been here
the whole time.

1364
00:50:03,003 --> 00:50:04,636
People never notice me.

1365
00:50:04,638 --> 00:50:06,504
It happens all the time.
It's...

1366
00:50:06,506 --> 00:50:08,907
kind of like a superpower,
but...

1367
00:50:08,909 --> 00:50:11,545
one that comes
with a crushing loneliness.

1368
00:50:14,814 --> 00:50:17,448
I'm blessed. I'm so blessed.

1369
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:19,150
Yeah, God is good.

1370
00:50:19,152 --> 00:50:20,451
Mm-hmm.

1371
00:50:20,453 --> 00:50:21,920
Okay.

1372
00:50:21,922 --> 00:50:24,055
Hey, Mila, what about you?

1373
00:50:24,057 --> 00:50:25,824
My parents are gonna be
really pissed

1374
00:50:25,826 --> 00:50:27,393
if I get busted again.

1375
00:50:28,728 --> 00:50:30,495
- Yeah, I'm in.
- I'm in.

1376
00:50:30,497 --> 00:50:31,429
- That's what I'm talking about.
- All right.

1377
00:50:31,431 --> 00:50:33,932
I just have one question
before we do this.

1378
00:50:33,934 --> 00:50:35,666
- What's up?
- Why does Teddy get to be

1379
00:50:35,668 --> 00:50:36,767
the ringleader, guys?
Come on.

1380
00:50:36,769 --> 00:50:38,535
- Goddamn it, Luis.
- Not now.

1381
00:50:38,537 --> 00:50:41,139
- I mean, seriously, man?
- It was his idea.

1382
00:50:41,141 --> 00:50:43,408
He knows this school
better than any of us.

1383
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:45,076
Ah. Just never mind the fact

1384
00:50:45,078 --> 00:50:47,678
that I snuck
into a little place...

1385
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,147
called America.

1386
00:50:49,149 --> 00:50:50,881
Ha! That's true!

1387
00:50:50,883 --> 00:50:53,017
Luis is hot tonight.

1388
00:51:28,588 --> 00:51:30,121
- Yo, T.
- What?

1389
00:51:30,123 --> 00:51:31,856
I appreciate you bringing

1390
00:51:31,858 --> 00:51:33,757
this amazing, blazing
Satan chicken.

1391
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,159
It's like, it's hot,
but it's not.

1392
00:51:35,161 --> 00:51:37,161
And I don't like spicy food,
but this one...

1393
00:51:37,163 --> 00:51:40,665
Let me tell you
what else is hot... your breath.

1394
00:51:40,667 --> 00:51:43,101
Why are you breathing on
the side of my face like that?

1395
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:45,535
- Oh.
- You're smacking all in my ear, man. Stop.

1396
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:48,705
You're still smacking.

1397
00:51:48,707 --> 00:51:50,507
Goddamn it, you're done.
You're done.

1398
00:51:50,509 --> 00:51:51,609
You're done with that.

1399
00:51:51,611 --> 00:51:53,878
Really?

1400
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,712
God, what-what is
your problem, man?

1401
00:51:55,714 --> 00:51:58,216
- What?
- I said wear all black. Why didn't you wear black?

1402
00:51:58,218 --> 00:52:01,084
Laundry day.
All my darks were in the wash.

1403
00:52:01,086 --> 00:52:02,486
So you wore yellow?

1404
00:52:02,488 --> 00:52:03,821
It's fresh. It's clean.

1405
00:52:03,823 --> 00:52:05,790
Get your...
get your arm out my face.

1406
00:52:05,792 --> 00:52:07,158
Get out of my face.

1407
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,060
Focus. Let's go.

1408
00:52:09,062 --> 00:52:10,796
Let's go.

1409
00:52:12,131 --> 00:52:13,797
Yo, Teddy,
what's the play, man?

1410
00:52:13,799 --> 00:52:15,800
Last night
I saw the janitor cleaning

1411
00:52:15,802 --> 00:52:17,902
Stewart's office
around 8:00 p.m.

1412
00:52:17,904 --> 00:52:20,038
I get it...
that's the inside man, huh?

1413
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,039
No, Bobby,
he's not my inside man.

1414
00:52:22,041 --> 00:52:23,976
He's the janitor.

1415
00:52:28,181 --> 00:52:29,847
Oh, shit.

1416
00:52:29,849 --> 00:52:32,183
I got
to take this, I got to take it.

1417
00:52:32,185 --> 00:52:33,850
Sh-Shit.

1418
00:52:33,852 --> 00:52:36,253
Aw.

1419
00:52:36,255 --> 00:52:38,055
No, no, no.

1420
00:52:43,029 --> 00:52:44,228
Hey, babe.

1421
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:46,129
Hey, baby, I miss you.

1422
00:52:46,131 --> 00:52:47,931
Are you still at work?

1423
00:52:47,933 --> 00:52:51,768
Uh, yeah, yeah, right now I'm in
the, uh, I'm in the break room.

1424
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:53,837
Can I get a tour of the office?

1425
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:56,274
If my baby wants a tour,
then she can get a tour.

1426
00:52:56,276 --> 00:52:57,975
- You always want to see something.
- Ah!

1427
00:52:57,977 --> 00:52:58,976
- If I...
- Oh, Teddy.

1428
00:52:58,978 --> 00:53:00,277
- Hey.
- Teddy, oh.

1429
00:53:00,279 --> 00:53:02,745
We got a situation here,
we got a real...

1430
00:53:02,747 --> 00:53:04,614
- Hot lava, hot lava.
- What? Hey.

1431
00:53:04,616 --> 00:53:05,882
- Okay.
- Um...

1432
00:53:05,884 --> 00:53:07,718
Oh, God, oh, God,
oh, God, oh, God!

1433
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:08,919
- Aah!
- Wha...?

1434
00:53:08,921 --> 00:53:10,053
God, turtle head sticking out.

1435
00:53:10,055 --> 00:53:11,321
- Oh, that's a big one.
- Uh...

1436
00:53:11,323 --> 00:53:13,689
- Babe, what is going on over there?
- Oh, big shit.

1437
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:15,058
Honey, that's, uh, that's actually...

1438
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,960
...that's actually one
of my account managers.

1439
00:53:17,796 --> 00:53:19,896
Personalities
all over the office.

1440
00:53:19,898 --> 00:53:21,031
Uh, nonstop laughs.

1441
00:53:21,033 --> 00:53:22,332
- Hot lava!
- Nonstop.

1442
00:53:22,334 --> 00:53:23,934
You know how I do...

1443
00:53:23,936 --> 00:53:25,869
play around... at the office.

1444
00:53:27,307 --> 00:53:28,306
- Who's...?
- Hey, yo, what's up, bro?

1445
00:53:28,308 --> 00:53:30,274
You hung up on me, man.

1446
00:53:30,276 --> 00:53:32,075
- Who's that?
- That's one of my,

1447
00:53:32,077 --> 00:53:33,910
that's one of my clients there,
right there.

1448
00:53:33,912 --> 00:53:35,912
Yeah, we were, we were going
over his portfolio.

1449
00:53:35,914 --> 00:53:37,580
Kind of looks
like he's in prison.

1450
00:53:37,582 --> 00:53:39,983
Oh, my God,
you're so beautiful, baby.

1451
00:53:39,985 --> 00:53:41,651
Well, he looks like that

1452
00:53:41,653 --> 00:53:43,954
'cause he is... insider trading.

1453
00:53:43,956 --> 00:53:45,789
He was wrongfully accused.

1454
00:53:45,791 --> 00:53:48,624
You're looking like J.Lo
<i>and</i> Beyoncé, mama.

1455
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:50,293
Would you mind showing me
your privates?

1456
00:53:50,295 --> 00:53:51,762
Enough, Bobby.

1457
00:53:51,764 --> 00:53:53,096
Like, turn around,
let me see that ass,

1458
00:53:53,098 --> 00:53:54,631
please, a little tit, something.

1459
00:53:54,633 --> 00:53:55,966
Excuse me?

1460
00:53:55,968 --> 00:53:57,300
I'm, like,
really strong right now.

1461
00:53:57,302 --> 00:54:00,203
Like, I could do things to you...
legendary shit.

1462
00:54:00,205 --> 00:54:01,171
Enough, Bobby.

1463
00:54:01,173 --> 00:54:02,972
I'll take some upper thigh,
but, for real,

1464
00:54:02,974 --> 00:54:05,208
I really want
to see some punani.

1465
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:06,176
Excuse me?

1466
00:54:06,178 --> 00:54:08,211
Listen... oh, my God.

1467
00:54:08,213 --> 00:54:09,279
I don't know what you put in me.

1468
00:54:09,281 --> 00:54:10,280
It just hit me.

1469
00:54:10,282 --> 00:54:11,714
But it feels like the Devil!

1470
00:54:11,716 --> 00:54:14,083
It just hit me what he said,
honey.

1471
00:54:14,085 --> 00:54:15,319
He's saying "piñata."

1472
00:54:15,321 --> 00:54:17,654
Man, I ain't see some punani
in so long.

1473
00:54:17,656 --> 00:54:19,122
Bobby likes to hit piñatas.

1474
00:54:19,124 --> 00:54:20,656
- No!
- Let me... you know what I'm gonna do?

1475
00:54:20,658 --> 00:54:21,958
Let me, let me call you back.

1476
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:22,893
- Uh...
- I love you,

1477
00:54:22,895 --> 00:54:25,095
and I... we'll do the tour
when I'm done.

1478
00:54:25,097 --> 00:54:26,929
Bye, babe.

1479
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:28,231
What was that, Bobby?

1480
00:54:28,233 --> 00:54:30,000
Yo, Ted, good looking, bro.

1481
00:54:30,002 --> 00:54:31,368
That's my fiancée, man.

1482
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:32,601
You don't talk to her like that.

1483
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:36,339
When I go back to the cell,
I got the legendary socky-sock.

1484
00:54:36,341 --> 00:54:38,707
You're not having a sock session
to my woman.

1485
00:54:38,709 --> 00:54:40,177
That's, that's not going
to happen.

1486
00:54:40,179 --> 00:54:42,245
I'm going all out.

1487
00:54:43,248 --> 00:54:44,814
Okay, what is in your ass, Mac?

1488
00:54:44,816 --> 00:54:46,782
Cut me a break, man.

1489
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:47,585
I've had enough!

1490
00:54:50,188 --> 00:54:52,322
Hold on a second,
we got a code red.

1491
00:54:52,324 --> 00:54:54,091
We got a code red.

1492
00:54:54,093 --> 00:54:55,859
Teddy, I got no toilet paper.

1493
00:54:55,861 --> 00:54:58,095
Toilet paper, Teddy,
one-time me!

1494
00:54:58,097 --> 00:54:59,129
One-time me!

1495
00:54:59,131 --> 00:55:00,898
Teddy!

1496
00:55:06,138 --> 00:55:07,870
All right, guys, listen.

1497
00:55:07,872 --> 00:55:09,705
When the janitor exits,

1498
00:55:09,707 --> 00:55:11,408
we're gonna go out,
we're gonna catch the door.

1499
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:13,309
And then we're gonna
enter quietly.

1500
00:55:13,311 --> 00:55:14,612
- Okay.
- Okay?

1501
00:55:15,881 --> 00:55:17,015
Wait a minute.

1502
00:55:18,016 --> 00:55:19,249
Where's Big Mac?

1503
00:55:19,251 --> 00:55:21,184
I thought he was with us.

1504
00:55:21,186 --> 00:55:23,085
He...

1505
00:55:23,087 --> 00:55:24,755
Damn it.

1506
00:55:30,429 --> 00:55:31,896
What's he doing?

1507
00:55:37,301 --> 00:55:39,236
- Oh, my God.
- What are you doing?

1508
00:55:39,238 --> 00:55:41,039
- Come on, come on, come on, come on.
- Mac!

1509
00:55:43,275 --> 00:55:45,975
- Holy shit, it worked.
- Oh, my God!

1510
00:55:45,977 --> 00:55:47,143
Mac!

1511
00:55:47,145 --> 00:55:48,244
Did you just kill him?

1512
00:55:48,246 --> 00:55:49,245
No, I didn't kill him.

1513
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,246
I just choked him out.

1514
00:55:50,248 --> 00:55:51,281
You said no witnesses.

1515
00:55:51,283 --> 00:55:52,748
When did I say that?

1516
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:54,119
You didn't say that?

1517
00:55:55,187 --> 00:55:56,219
Oh, God.

1518
00:55:56,221 --> 00:55:57,287
You know what?

1519
00:55:57,289 --> 00:55:58,888
I got my signals crossed.

1520
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:00,723
There's a lot
of instructions, Teddy.

1521
00:56:00,725 --> 00:56:02,124
I didn't say anything about...

1522
00:56:02,126 --> 00:56:04,961
You know what?
You are going to fix this.

1523
00:56:04,963 --> 00:56:06,795
Do you hear me, Mac?
You're gonna hide this body.

1524
00:56:06,797 --> 00:56:08,831
- Chop him up?
- Hide...

1525
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:10,733
- Burn it?
- Hide it.

1526
00:56:10,735 --> 00:56:11,736
Chop, burn, bury?

1527
00:56:14,305 --> 00:56:16,208
- Hey. Anybody got anything?
- No.

1528
00:56:17,742 --> 00:56:19,041
All right, Mila,
how we looking?

1529
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:20,843
Keep looking.

1530
00:56:20,845 --> 00:56:23,479
- Suck my balls, Teddy!
- Shit.

1531
00:56:23,481 --> 00:56:25,814
- Shit.
- You should've seen your face.

1532
00:56:25,816 --> 00:56:28,118
- You look ridiculous.
- Shh!

1533
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,852
All right, I stashed the body,

1534
00:56:29,854 --> 00:56:31,887
and God willing, he'll wake up
in a couple hours.

1535
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,856
Also, that baseball coach/
principal guy,

1536
00:56:33,858 --> 00:56:35,324
he's on his way.

1537
00:56:35,326 --> 00:56:37,326
What? Why wouldn't you
lead with that?

1538
00:56:40,932 --> 00:56:43,332
Damn. It's the PTA meeting.

1539
00:56:43,334 --> 00:56:45,203
Oh, shit.

1540
00:56:46,337 --> 00:56:48,204
Theresa, you're up.

1541
00:56:48,206 --> 00:56:49,371
- What? What? I...
- Listen to me.

1542
00:56:49,373 --> 00:56:51,074
- Okay.
- I need you to go out there,

1543
00:56:51,076 --> 00:56:52,275
and I need you to stall.

1544
00:56:52,277 --> 00:56:53,809
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I can't flirt.

1545
00:56:53,811 --> 00:56:55,177
- I-I don't know any moves.
- I-I don't need that.

1546
00:56:55,179 --> 00:56:56,546
I haven't flirted
since like 1996, and even then,

1547
00:56:56,548 --> 00:56:58,314
it was like offering
to give the cop a handy

1548
00:56:58,316 --> 00:56:59,949
to get off a speeding ticket,
and guess what.

1549
00:56:59,951 --> 00:57:01,317
He didn't take it.
I'm bad at it.

1550
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:02,551
That's not what
I'm asking you to do.

1551
00:57:02,553 --> 00:57:03,953
In my day,
it was really innocent.

1552
00:57:03,955 --> 00:57:05,422
Now it's all about the butt.

1553
00:57:05,424 --> 00:57:06,922
I heard a guy
the other day say,

1554
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:09,825
"I'm gonna crack that butt
like a walnut."

1555
00:57:09,827 --> 00:57:11,826
- What?
- What does that even mean?

1556
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:13,229
- Why would you start there?
- Stop it.

1557
00:57:13,231 --> 00:57:14,996
Wouldn't you want
to start in the front?

1558
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:16,499
- Theresa, listen.
- With a nice missionary position,

1559
00:57:16,501 --> 00:57:18,467
you know, some gentle touching.

1560
00:57:18,469 --> 00:57:20,069
In my day,
maybe once in your lifetime,

1561
00:57:20,071 --> 00:57:21,904
you might get the end
of a pinky,

1562
00:57:21,906 --> 00:57:23,372
and that was the thrill
of a lifetime, okay?

1563
00:57:23,374 --> 00:57:25,274
Stop it.
That's a lot of information

1564
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:26,841
that I did not need to know.

1565
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:27,943
Yeah, that was a lot.

1566
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:29,445
Go talk about bake sales.

1567
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:31,013
- Mom stuff. Not-not butt stuff.
- Yeah, mom stuff.

1568
00:57:31,015 --> 00:57:32,848
- Go mom it.
- I-I'll try. I'll try.

1569
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:34,183
- Okay? Okay.
- I can do that.

1570
00:57:34,185 --> 00:57:35,384
- Go, go.
- Got it. Okay.

1571
00:57:35,386 --> 00:57:38,820
Shit. Luis, go out there
before she puts

1572
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:40,122
- something in her butt.
- Okay.

1573
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:41,257
Okay?

1574
00:57:45,196 --> 00:57:46,462
What are you doing, Mac?

1575
00:57:46,464 --> 00:57:47,996
Looking for trapdoors.

1576
00:57:50,468 --> 00:57:52,368
I'm glad you're here, Mac.

1577
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:53,335
Send it to me first, please.

1578
00:57:53,337 --> 00:57:54,136
- Right, right.
- We can e-mail you the rest.

1579
00:57:54,138 --> 00:57:55,004
'Cause I just want to...
Thank you.

1580
00:57:55,006 --> 00:57:56,171
- That would be great.
- I'll send out

1581
00:57:56,173 --> 00:57:58,340
- that e-mail tonight, okay?
- Yeah. Thank you so much.

1582
00:57:58,342 --> 00:57:59,575
- Okay, bye.
- Drive home safe.

1583
00:57:59,577 --> 00:58:01,175
Oh, hey.

1584
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:02,411
Hi.

1585
00:58:02,413 --> 00:58:04,614
Thank you for that great,
wonderful meeting.

1586
00:58:04,616 --> 00:58:06,448
I'm sorry, do I know you?

1587
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:08,384
I was in there. Remember?

1588
00:58:08,386 --> 00:58:09,618
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1589
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:11,853
- Hi. Mrs. Howerton.
- No, you, uh, just...

1590
00:58:11,855 --> 00:58:13,354
Mrs. Howerton. Yes, of course.

1591
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:15,190
No, you brought up, uh,
several compelling issues.

1592
00:58:15,192 --> 00:58:16,525
I sure did.

1593
00:58:16,527 --> 00:58:18,260
Well, what can I help you with?

1594
00:58:18,262 --> 00:58:20,362
- She sucks at this. Hurry.
- I'm almost there.

1595
00:58:20,364 --> 00:58:23,064
So my child gets an assignment
about the solar system,

1596
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:24,433
and it's to make a diorama,

1597
00:58:24,435 --> 00:58:26,100
and he doesn't know how
to make a diorama.

1598
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:27,503
I'm the one
with the hot glue gun

1599
00:58:27,505 --> 00:58:29,371
in the middle of the night...
it's 11:00 p.m.

1600
00:58:29,373 --> 00:58:31,206
I mean, don't get me wrong,
we're blessed to go to

1601
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:32,574
- school here, but I'm...
- I'm sorry, I have to go.

1602
00:58:32,576 --> 00:58:34,376
- Okay? Call my office.
- I will. - Hurry up.

1603
00:58:34,378 --> 00:58:35,411
I'm going, I'm going.
Calm down.

1604
00:58:35,413 --> 00:58:37,045
Come on, Mila.

1605
00:58:37,047 --> 00:58:38,279
You've made some great points,

1606
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:40,382
but I have to go now.
Good night.

1607
00:58:40,384 --> 00:58:42,318
- Wait a minute.
- Thank you. I have to go.

1608
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,520
- Okay, I really have to go.
- Wait. No.

1609
00:58:44,522 --> 00:58:45,920
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

1610
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:47,456
Oh! Are you okay?

1611
00:58:47,458 --> 00:58:48,890
I feel faint.

1612
00:58:48,892 --> 00:58:50,391
Well, let's get you some water.

1613
00:58:50,393 --> 00:58:52,094
- Are you...?
- Thanks for catching me.

1614
00:58:52,096 --> 00:58:54,463
Of course. Are you all right?

1615
00:58:54,465 --> 00:58:56,498
I...

1616
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,434
Are you having a seizure?

1617
00:59:00,503 --> 00:59:02,437
Do you have something
in your teeth?

1618
00:59:02,439 --> 00:59:05,307
- I wish I had you in my teeth.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

1619
00:59:05,309 --> 00:59:07,576
Okay, no, I didn't realize
that's what this was.

1620
00:59:07,578 --> 00:59:09,143
- No, thank you, ma'am.
- Gentle touching.

1621
00:59:09,145 --> 00:59:10,411
I am the principal
of your child's school.

1622
00:59:10,413 --> 00:59:11,680
- I have to walk away now, okay?
- I...

1623
00:59:11,682 --> 00:59:13,147
I'm in a loveless marriage.
Please.

1624
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:14,248
I am not participating in this!

1625
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:15,084
- You don't have to participate.
- To a professional.

1626
00:59:15,086 --> 00:59:17,018
I'll do it.
I'll do all the work.

1627
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,287
- No, I'm...
- I'll do it all.

1628
00:59:18,289 --> 00:59:19,488
- If you just...
- Ma'am.

1629
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:20,622
- ...look me in the eyes...
- Ma'am, ma'am.

1630
00:59:20,624 --> 00:59:21,623
Not appropriate, okay?

1631
00:59:21,625 --> 00:59:22,624
- Okay, here it is.
- Okay?

1632
00:59:22,626 --> 00:59:23,692
If this is what you want.

1633
00:59:23,694 --> 00:59:24,692
This is what it's about
with you.

1634
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:26,627
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
I'm not looking.

1635
00:59:26,629 --> 00:59:27,830
Crack it open like a walnut.

1636
00:59:27,832 --> 00:59:30,366
- Thank you. No, thank you.
- Crack that nut like a walnut.

1637
00:59:30,368 --> 00:59:31,533
Thank you. No, thank you.

1638
00:59:31,535 --> 00:59:33,602
- Crack that nut open.
- Thank you.

1639
00:59:33,604 --> 00:59:36,237
- No, thank you.
- Do what men do with women's asses.

1640
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,438
Oh, man.

1641
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,239
- Just tap it!
- I can't...

1642
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:39,041
I can't stand here
for this, okay?

1643
00:59:39,043 --> 00:59:40,041
- Give it a crack...
- Good night.

1644
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:43,111
Come on, give it some.

1645
00:59:43,113 --> 00:59:45,279
Oh, that was so hard.

1646
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:47,715
She wanted you so bad.

1647
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:50,251
But you can't go there.

1648
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,621
Principals have principles.

1649
00:59:52,623 --> 00:59:55,390
Mmm. Oh, but you know Stewie

1650
00:59:55,392 --> 00:59:57,158
would've tore
that ass up, though!

1651
00:59:58,461 --> 01:00:00,561
Not a black voice.

1652
01:00:05,603 --> 01:00:08,336
Let's see.

1653
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:47,210
Hello? Hello?

1654
01:00:48,178 --> 01:00:49,412
Somebody in here?

1655
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:56,619
I have a bat.

1656
01:00:57,687 --> 01:00:59,220
And I'm not afraid to use it.

1657
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:02,222
If there is someone in here,

1658
01:01:02,224 --> 01:01:03,661
you are trespassing.

1659
01:01:04,728 --> 01:01:08,062
And I am well within my rights

1660
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:09,564
to defend myself.

1661
01:01:09,566 --> 01:01:12,300
So come on out,

1662
01:01:12,302 --> 01:01:15,704
and I won't bash your head.

1663
01:01:15,706 --> 01:01:18,272
Help!

1664
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:19,740
Anybody out there?

1665
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,211
Get me out of here!

1666
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:27,381
Whoa.

1667
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:29,650
- Okay.
- What the hell, Mac?

1668
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:31,752
- That was close.
- You're damn right it was, Mac.

1669
01:01:31,754 --> 01:01:33,154
I wonder why.

1670
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:34,689
Yeah, I... well,
it's 'cause I sneezed.

1671
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,156
I know what you did.

1672
01:01:36,158 --> 01:01:37,625
What?

1673
01:01:37,627 --> 01:01:39,128
I got it.

1674
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:43,364
I really tried.
I even did the butt stuff.

1675
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,198
I told you don't do
the butt stuff.

1676
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,334
I don't know, fam,
might've worked.

1677
01:01:46,336 --> 01:01:48,368
Looked like he might've sauced
his drawers, real talk.

1678
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:49,670
He what?

1679
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:51,205
He-he was turned on.

1680
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:52,273
Really?

1681
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:53,341
Shit, I was, too.

1682
01:01:53,343 --> 01:01:54,342
Hey.

1683
01:01:54,344 --> 01:01:55,576
Thanks, Jaylen.

1684
01:01:55,578 --> 01:01:57,478
You got that little
eco-friendly vibe going.

1685
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,713
What's eco-friendly?

1686
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,146
Very little waste.

1687
01:02:00,148 --> 01:02:02,349
Oh, I thought you meant
her bush.

1688
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:04,685
No. Oh, you know what?
I'm with that.

1689
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:06,487
Hey, now!

1690
01:02:06,489 --> 01:02:07,722
Okay, Jaylen, Jaylen!

1691
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,222
We gotta go, y'all. Let's go.

1692
01:02:09,224 --> 01:02:10,658
Yeah, let's go.
Come on, come on.

1693
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,227
Shit.

1694
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:17,832
Who's out there?

1695
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:20,703
Somebody help me, please.

1696
01:02:23,438 --> 01:02:25,105
What happened?

1697
01:02:25,107 --> 01:02:26,673
I don't know.
Someone grabbed me from behind

1698
01:02:26,675 --> 01:02:28,543
and threw me in the slop sink.

1699
01:02:28,545 --> 01:02:30,545
Game face, Lonnie.

1700
01:02:30,547 --> 01:02:33,446
We're on lockdown.

1701
01:02:33,448 --> 01:02:34,782
Ah, yeah!

1702
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:37,284
- That'll get him.
- Hey!

1703
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:39,120
- Oh, shit.
- Go, go, go! - Hey!

1704
01:02:39,122 --> 01:02:41,656
Shit.

1705
01:02:41,658 --> 01:02:43,791
- What do we...? Hey.
- Shit.

1706
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:46,226
Oh. Hey, Bobby.

1707
01:02:46,228 --> 01:02:48,562
Bobby, shit just got real, man,
what do we do?

1708
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:50,697
Man, I don't know,
just don't get shot, bro.

1709
01:02:50,699 --> 01:02:51,832
What do you mean,
"don't get shot"?

1710
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:53,701
Bobby, you're supposed
to be a hardened criminal, man.

1711
01:02:53,703 --> 01:02:55,536
That can't be your advice.

1712
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:57,404
What the hell'd you go
to jail for, Bobby?

1713
01:02:57,406 --> 01:02:59,339
I robbed Whole Foods, bro.

1714
01:02:59,341 --> 01:03:00,740
I robbed Whole Foods.

1715
01:03:00,742 --> 01:03:02,175
That's your crime?

1716
01:03:02,177 --> 01:03:04,745
You went to jail
for stealing $15 lettuce?

1717
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:06,581
No, bro, you're sleeping.

1718
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:09,249
I moved some coke and some dope
in the day, but my kale game...

1719
01:03:09,251 --> 01:03:11,384
- my kale game...
- No.

1720
01:03:11,386 --> 01:03:12,385
Now, that's mean!

1721
01:03:12,387 --> 01:03:13,887
Grass-fed beef.

1722
01:03:13,889 --> 01:03:16,256
You don't know nothing
about no free-range chicken.

1723
01:03:16,258 --> 01:03:18,291
- Thug life!
- Jaylen, calm... calm down.

1724
01:03:18,293 --> 01:03:19,894
- And I had all the farmer markets on smash.
- No, no.

1725
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:21,428
You don't get to explain.

1726
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:23,296
You don't get to expla... Bye.

1727
01:03:23,298 --> 01:03:24,664
All right, y'all, this way.

1728
01:03:24,666 --> 01:03:25,665
Attention, intruders.

1729
01:03:25,667 --> 01:03:27,335
This is Principal Patowsky.

1730
01:03:27,337 --> 01:03:30,905
The exit doors are locked down.
There is no escape.

1731
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:34,374
I-I can't believe we're gonna
die over a GED practice test.

1732
01:03:34,376 --> 01:03:35,642
- It's not even a real test.
- Listen.

1733
01:03:35,644 --> 01:03:37,544
I just did this
to get out of the house.

1734
01:03:37,546 --> 01:03:38,846
I thought this
was gonna be fun.

1735
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:40,180
You know,
we're gonna break in...

1736
01:03:40,182 --> 01:03:41,414
Just shut up! Just shut up!

1737
01:03:41,416 --> 01:03:43,918
Shut up! Goddamn!

1738
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,453
Been talking about your kids
and everything all day!

1739
01:03:46,455 --> 01:03:48,188
This ain't the time.

1740
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:49,623
Now, y'all pull it together.

1741
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:50,925
We are fine.

1742
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:52,292
We-we... we are okay.

1743
01:03:52,294 --> 01:03:53,728
The roof. Let's hit the roof.

1744
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:55,295
Okay, when I went
to school here,

1745
01:03:55,297 --> 01:03:56,496
that's how we got out
of school.

1746
01:03:56,498 --> 01:03:58,698
And then we would jump onto
the elementary school roof.

1747
01:03:58,700 --> 01:03:59,635
Come on!

1748
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,238
- Move it, move it!
- This is a bad idea.

1749
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:06,339
- Come on!
- This is a bad idea!

1750
01:04:06,341 --> 01:04:08,241
- Watch it, watch it.
- Whoa, whoa!

1751
01:04:08,243 --> 01:04:09,843
- Whoa, whoa!
- Whoa!

1752
01:04:09,845 --> 01:04:11,277
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Whoa.

1753
01:04:11,279 --> 01:04:12,479
- Oh, my God.
- Whoa, whoa!

1754
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:13,713
Okay, back up.

1755
01:04:13,715 --> 01:04:15,215
- Listen to me.
- Come on!

1756
01:04:15,217 --> 01:04:16,784
Swear to you,
when I went to school here,

1757
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:18,351
that jump did not seem
that high.

1758
01:04:18,353 --> 01:04:19,719
There's no way I can make that.

1759
01:04:19,721 --> 01:04:21,855
I can jump like three feet.
My knees and my back

1760
01:04:21,857 --> 01:04:23,923
are totally shot
from moving boxes, Teddy!

1761
01:04:23,925 --> 01:04:25,224
- All right.
- What are we gonna do?

1762
01:04:25,226 --> 01:04:26,225
- What are we gonna do?
- Listen, listen.

1763
01:04:26,227 --> 01:04:27,360
I got it.

1764
01:04:27,362 --> 01:04:28,728
Let's just say it's 15 feet.

1765
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:29,864
Oh, God.

1766
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,364
Take that 15 feet,

1767
01:04:31,366 --> 01:04:33,233
minus the three feet
that you can jump.

1768
01:04:33,235 --> 01:04:34,467
What are you talking about?

1769
01:04:34,469 --> 01:04:36,736
All we gotta do is use
the Pythagorean theorem.

1770
01:04:36,738 --> 01:04:37,704
Nobody was listening in class.

1771
01:04:37,706 --> 01:04:39,539
- Nobody knows how to do that.
- Oh, my God.

1772
01:04:39,541 --> 01:04:40,774
No, wait, wait, wait.
Carrie said... Carrie said,

1773
01:04:40,776 --> 01:04:41,976
in order to do
the Pythagorean theorem,

1774
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:43,743
you-you have to know
the hypotenuse.

1775
01:04:43,745 --> 01:04:46,346
All we gotta do
is hypotenuse it.

1776
01:04:46,348 --> 01:04:47,947
A-squared plus B-squared
equals C-squared.

1777
01:04:47,949 --> 01:04:49,716
If you know... know two sides,

1778
01:04:49,718 --> 01:04:51,018
then that'll help you
figure out the third,

1779
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:52,686
so it's roughly
six feet across,

1780
01:04:52,688 --> 01:04:55,388
and 15-squared is 225
divided by six-squared...

1781
01:04:55,390 --> 01:04:56,890
- Hypotenuse it!
- Wait, what did I just say?

1782
01:04:56,892 --> 01:04:58,357
- It's 36.
- Yeah, 36.

1783
01:04:58,359 --> 01:04:59,726
But you don't divide it.
You add it.

1784
01:04:59,728 --> 01:05:01,360
So, what did I just say?
The, um... the, uh...

1785
01:05:01,362 --> 01:05:02,594
- She's the best one at math.
- Wait, no, uh...

1786
01:05:02,596 --> 01:05:03,797
- Hypotenuse it!
- No, no, you can do this.

1787
01:05:03,799 --> 01:05:05,865
- By six-squared, then... I-I don't know.
- No.

1788
01:05:05,867 --> 01:05:07,333
No, come on. You got this.

1789
01:05:08,804 --> 01:05:10,402
Oh, my God!

1790
01:05:10,404 --> 01:05:12,538
- Mila!
- Oh, my God!

1791
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:14,607
Oh!

1792
01:05:14,609 --> 01:05:15,642
- You all right?
- Guys!

1793
01:05:15,644 --> 01:05:17,410
It's not a hard math problem.

1794
01:05:17,412 --> 01:05:18,745
It's a simple physics problem.

1795
01:05:18,747 --> 01:05:19,946
Just jump.

1796
01:05:19,948 --> 01:05:21,981
Did you...
did you hypotenuse it?

1797
01:05:21,983 --> 01:05:23,717
Yeah, I hypotenused it.

1798
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:25,350
Can you just jump?

1799
01:05:25,352 --> 01:05:26,853
Mac, you're up next.

1800
01:05:26,855 --> 01:05:28,521
- No. No.
- Yes.

1801
01:05:28,523 --> 01:05:30,390
Mac, don't you
give me that, okay?

1802
01:05:30,392 --> 01:05:31,958
When I think "man,"
I think you.

1803
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:35,327
I think about how proud
Little Mac must be.

1804
01:05:35,329 --> 01:05:37,030
I want you to do
what you do best

1805
01:05:37,032 --> 01:05:38,363
and go be great.

1806
01:05:38,365 --> 01:05:40,633
Okay. Yeah.

1807
01:05:40,635 --> 01:05:42,435
Get across that roof, Mac.

1808
01:05:42,437 --> 01:05:43,670
- Yeah! Okay!
- All right?

1809
01:05:43,672 --> 01:05:44,871
- All right.
- You got this.

1810
01:05:44,873 --> 01:05:47,040
Mac coming in! Step back!

1811
01:05:47,042 --> 01:05:48,875
- Let's go, Mac.
- Thank you, Teddy.

1812
01:05:48,877 --> 01:05:50,844
Any time.

1813
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:52,312
Mac attack!

1814
01:05:54,015 --> 01:05:55,314
Mac attack!

1815
01:05:55,316 --> 01:05:57,316
♪ Owner of a lonely heart...

1816
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:06,226
Shit!

1817
01:06:07,896 --> 01:06:09,095
Oh, God!

1818
01:06:09,097 --> 01:06:10,496
Oh, Teddy!

1819
01:06:10,498 --> 01:06:12,598
- Oh, why'd I listen to you?
- Shit.

1820
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,032
You were so convincing!

1821
01:06:14,034 --> 01:06:16,402
- I'm sorry, buddy.
- Hey.

1822
01:06:16,404 --> 01:06:17,937
My arm's kind of tingly.

1823
01:06:17,939 --> 01:06:19,906
I think I might have hurt it.

1824
01:06:19,908 --> 01:06:21,573
Feels weird, man.

1825
01:06:21,575 --> 01:06:23,344
His damn shoulder
is in his mouth.

1826
01:06:29,618 --> 01:06:30,683
Oh!

1827
01:06:30,685 --> 01:06:32,051
Hey.

1828
01:06:32,053 --> 01:06:33,819
Big Mac, man,
I'm sorry about that.

1829
01:06:33,821 --> 01:06:36,922
That hot chicken, it just
kind of got on rewind, man.

1830
01:06:36,924 --> 01:06:38,625
It was either the back or the front,

1831
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:40,593
and I just got
these pants, fam.

1832
01:06:40,595 --> 01:06:43,765
Oh, God, I'm having
the worst night!

1833
01:07:01,916 --> 01:07:04,416
Hello, Teddy.

1834
01:07:04,418 --> 01:07:05,854
Huh?

1835
01:07:08,389 --> 01:07:09,922
Hey, babe.

1836
01:07:09,924 --> 01:07:12,424
You don't need
to "hey, babe" me.

1837
01:07:15,664 --> 01:07:17,464
I know what's going on.

1838
01:07:19,533 --> 01:07:20,467
What's, uh, um...

1839
01:07:21,569 --> 01:07:22,570
What's going on?

1840
01:07:24,104 --> 01:07:25,904
The late hours?

1841
01:07:25,906 --> 01:07:27,408
The secrecy?

1842
01:07:28,742 --> 01:07:30,176
Just admit it, Teddy.

1843
01:07:30,178 --> 01:07:31,810
Just admit what?

1844
01:07:31,812 --> 01:07:32,947
It's so obvious.

1845
01:07:35,082 --> 01:07:36,650
You're getting cold feet.

1846
01:07:43,557 --> 01:07:45,593
Yeah!

1847
01:07:46,694 --> 01:07:47,993
Cold feet?

1848
01:07:47,995 --> 01:07:50,864
Ever since you proposed,
you haven't been yourself.

1849
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:52,497
Cold feet?

1850
01:07:52,499 --> 01:07:56,935
Lisa, I am not getting
cold feet.

1851
01:07:56,937 --> 01:07:59,671
In fact, it's the...
it's the complete opposite.

1852
01:07:59,673 --> 01:08:01,006
My feet are very warm.

1853
01:08:01,008 --> 01:08:02,942
I want this.

1854
01:08:02,944 --> 01:08:04,443
And I apologize.

1855
01:08:04,445 --> 01:08:05,911
I apologize if things have been

1856
01:08:05,913 --> 01:08:08,447
a little crazy as of late,
but, babe,

1857
01:08:08,449 --> 01:08:10,148
you gotta know
that I am out here.

1858
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:12,117
I'm-I'm... I'm trying.

1859
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:16,655
Okay? I am busting my ass
every day, every night,

1860
01:08:16,657 --> 01:08:18,191
for us.

1861
01:08:18,193 --> 01:08:20,158
For me and you.

1862
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:22,027
I'm in a different world
out there, babe.

1863
01:08:22,029 --> 01:08:24,796
And this world
is stressing me out.

1864
01:08:24,798 --> 01:08:28,734
It is stressing me out.

1865
01:08:29,937 --> 01:08:31,603
I'm sorry I doubted you.

1866
01:08:31,605 --> 01:08:34,006
I-I know this career change
has been a lot.

1867
01:08:34,008 --> 01:08:36,041
It's a lot.

1868
01:08:36,043 --> 01:08:38,744
It's so much.

1869
01:08:38,746 --> 01:08:41,046
It's so, so much.

1870
01:08:41,048 --> 01:08:42,883
Poor baby.

1871
01:08:47,154 --> 01:08:48,454
- I love you.
- Oh.

1872
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:54,862
I love you, too.

1873
01:08:57,698 --> 01:08:59,264
<i>Does that complete your order?</i>

1874
01:08:59,266 --> 01:09:01,066
Oh, wait, h-hold up.

1875
01:09:01,068 --> 01:09:02,267
- I don't want that apple pie.
- Yeah, I can't... I'm sorry.

1876
01:09:02,269 --> 01:09:03,635
It's-it's kind of hard
to hear you.

1877
01:09:03,637 --> 01:09:04,770
There's a baby
in the background.

1878
01:09:04,772 --> 01:09:06,138
Baby, I said be quiet.
Sit down!

1879
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,739
Yeah, say-say it
one more time for me.

1880
01:09:07,741 --> 01:09:09,207
- Say it... say it again.
- Is that burger good or what?

1881
01:09:09,209 --> 01:09:11,076
Is there any way
I can get you to respectfully

1882
01:09:11,078 --> 01:09:12,677
- shut that baby up?
- What'd you say?

1883
01:09:12,679 --> 01:09:14,846
- Just pull up to the window, for the love...
- Heck no!

1884
01:09:14,848 --> 01:09:16,615
Oh. Shit.

1885
01:09:16,617 --> 01:09:17,883
- Shit.
- It won't work.

1886
01:09:17,885 --> 01:09:19,084
I see you, Teddy.

1887
01:09:19,086 --> 01:09:20,584
It's not working.

1888
01:09:20,586 --> 01:09:23,654
Teddy Walker
behind the soda machine.

1889
01:09:23,656 --> 01:09:24,989
- Hello?
- Shit.

1890
01:09:24,991 --> 01:09:27,526
Teddy Walker.
I see you looking at...

1891
01:09:27,528 --> 01:09:28,593
We're making eye contact
right now.

1892
01:09:28,595 --> 01:09:30,262
Open your eyes, Teddy.

1893
01:09:30,264 --> 01:09:32,697
- Teddy, come here!
- Stewart.

1894
01:09:32,699 --> 01:09:33,932
Hey.

1895
01:09:33,934 --> 01:09:35,067
Stewart,
you were saying "Teddy"?

1896
01:09:35,069 --> 01:09:36,268
About ten times.

1897
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:37,635
- Hey.
- Hey.

1898
01:09:37,637 --> 01:09:38,637
- Do me a favor.
- Yep.

1899
01:09:38,639 --> 01:09:40,539
Uh, go over there
and handle that situation

1900
01:09:40,541 --> 01:09:41,472
- at the drive-through.
- Uh-huh.

1901
01:09:41,474 --> 01:09:42,975
And I'll tell you
what to do after that,

1902
01:09:42,977 --> 01:09:44,042
because I'm in charge.

1903
01:09:44,044 --> 01:09:45,743
- Hey, so...
- Hello?

1904
01:09:45,745 --> 01:09:47,545
Give me a second. M-Ma'am...

1905
01:09:47,547 --> 01:09:49,013
- I said I didn't want the pie.
- Okay, ma'am, ma...

1906
01:09:49,015 --> 01:09:49,947
- She don't want the pie.
- Uh-uh.

1907
01:09:49,949 --> 01:09:51,850
Take the pie off.
She want to get the...

1908
01:09:51,852 --> 01:09:53,151
I said I ain't getting a pie.

1909
01:09:53,153 --> 01:09:54,219
- Pull up!
- You heard me.

1910
01:09:54,221 --> 01:09:55,686
- Pull up to the window!
- All right.

1911
01:09:55,688 --> 01:09:57,022
When she pull up, tell me,

1912
01:09:57,024 --> 01:09:58,956
'cause I'm gonna come punch
the baby in the face.

1913
01:09:58,958 --> 01:10:01,125
God don't see everything.
Just let me know.

1914
01:10:01,127 --> 01:10:05,063
Hey, talk to me, man.
How you doing?

1915
01:10:05,065 --> 01:10:07,065
You know, I thought
it was the Woodbridge punks

1916
01:10:07,067 --> 01:10:09,800
that broke into the school,
but now it all makes sense.

1917
01:10:09,802 --> 01:10:12,903
I found this

1918
01:10:12,905 --> 01:10:14,508
at the scene of the crime.

1919
01:10:15,876 --> 01:10:17,242
So, what'd you do, huh?

1920
01:10:17,244 --> 01:10:18,310
Break into my computer?

1921
01:10:18,312 --> 01:10:20,145
Steal the midterm?

1922
01:10:20,147 --> 01:10:21,712
Being a little paranoid,
aren't we, Stew?

1923
01:10:21,714 --> 01:10:23,315
- Am I?
- Stewart, that's a plastic bag

1924
01:10:23,317 --> 01:10:25,649
with a chicken wrapper in it
with the word "evidence"

1925
01:10:25,651 --> 01:10:28,053
written on it, which is
probably in your handwriting.

1926
01:10:28,055 --> 01:10:31,123
It's not exactly
a smoking gun, Stew.

1927
01:10:31,125 --> 01:10:33,158
It's just a coincidence, right?

1928
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,259
Probably.

1929
01:10:34,261 --> 01:10:36,027
If you stole that test,

1930
01:10:36,029 --> 01:10:37,862
I will find out, Teddy.

1931
01:10:37,864 --> 01:10:40,832
I'm an honest man trying
to make an honest living.

1932
01:10:40,834 --> 01:10:43,667
Teddy Walker does not cheat.

1933
01:10:43,669 --> 01:10:45,071
You cheated.

1934
01:10:46,973 --> 01:10:48,973
Every last one of you...

1935
01:10:48,975 --> 01:10:50,742
cheated.

1936
01:10:50,744 --> 01:10:52,877
Uh... whoa.

1937
01:10:52,879 --> 01:10:55,247
Carrie, those are
very strong accusations.

1938
01:10:55,249 --> 01:10:57,382
For real. Like, what?

1939
01:10:57,384 --> 01:10:58,749
I'm offended.

1940
01:10:58,751 --> 01:11:00,918
Well, I'll take note
of that, Teddy.

1941
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:03,088
Which one of you want
to own up to it?

1942
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:04,755
I'm offended, too.

1943
01:11:04,757 --> 01:11:06,191
Bobby?

1944
01:11:06,193 --> 01:11:07,625
You a criminal.

1945
01:11:07,627 --> 01:11:08,726
You obviously not good at it.

1946
01:11:08,728 --> 01:11:10,027
That's why you in jail.

1947
01:11:10,029 --> 01:11:11,996
Did you orchestrate
this whole thing?

1948
01:11:11,998 --> 01:11:14,732
I mean, why you gonna
pick on me and profile me?

1949
01:11:14,734 --> 01:11:16,734
I'm the only one
locked up here.

1950
01:11:16,736 --> 01:11:18,836
So, if I'm locked up in here,

1951
01:11:18,838 --> 01:11:21,372
how can I be out there
stealing the test, Miss Carrie?

1952
01:11:21,374 --> 01:11:23,074
Oh, oh, wait a minute.

1953
01:11:23,076 --> 01:11:24,108
Y'all stole the test?

1954
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:25,209
I'm not saying nothing.

1955
01:11:25,211 --> 01:11:26,311
I don't know nothing.

1956
01:11:26,313 --> 01:11:27,845
I don't know shit.

1957
01:11:27,847 --> 01:11:29,046
'Cause I never said nothing

1958
01:11:29,048 --> 01:11:30,648
about anybody
stealing the test.

1959
01:11:30,650 --> 01:11:32,983
We're about to get
to the truth.

1960
01:11:32,985 --> 01:11:34,952
Who stole the test?

1961
01:11:34,954 --> 01:11:36,719
Mac?

1962
01:11:36,721 --> 01:11:40,024
You want to explain to me
how you got a perfect score?

1963
01:11:40,026 --> 01:11:41,426
Here's the thing, all right?

1964
01:11:41,428 --> 01:11:44,261
I know I didn't get
a perfect score,

1965
01:11:44,263 --> 01:11:45,729
because I missed a few
on purpose.

1966
01:11:45,731 --> 01:11:46,730
Oh, fudge.

1967
01:11:48,367 --> 01:11:50,335
Thank you!

1968
01:11:50,337 --> 01:11:51,869
You's a snitch, Mac.

1969
01:11:51,871 --> 01:11:53,438
Snitches are bitches.

1970
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,806
I don't like cheaters.

1971
01:11:55,808 --> 01:11:59,944
And I hate that I am teaching
a room full of cheaters.

1972
01:11:59,946 --> 01:12:02,179
I don't like men that cheat.

1973
01:12:02,181 --> 01:12:03,814
I don't like women that cheat.

1974
01:12:03,816 --> 01:12:05,116
I don't even deal
with politicians.

1975
01:12:05,118 --> 01:12:07,151
You know why?
'Cause they all cheaters.

1976
01:12:07,153 --> 01:12:08,786
I don't even eat Cheetos.

1977
01:12:08,788 --> 01:12:10,687
You know why? 'Cause it
sound like "cheaters."

1978
01:12:10,689 --> 01:12:13,090
Plus that Cheeto dust
will give you that Trump color.

1979
01:12:13,092 --> 01:12:15,159
- Yeah.
- It's hard to get that Cheeto dust

1980
01:12:15,161 --> 01:12:17,027
off your hands.

1981
01:12:17,029 --> 01:12:18,896
It'll mess up your Girbauds.

1982
01:12:18,898 --> 01:12:20,798
You know, I liked you at first.

1983
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,133
I'm done with all of y'all.

1984
01:12:22,135 --> 01:12:24,068
All of y'all can get up
out my class.

1985
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:25,402
- I'm done with y'all.
- What?

1986
01:12:25,404 --> 01:12:27,204
Okay, Carrie, let me...
I want to say something.

1987
01:12:27,206 --> 01:12:29,206
What about my GED? He's gonna
drop out of high school.

1988
01:12:29,208 --> 01:12:31,408
If I don't get my GED,
I'm going to prison.

1989
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:32,810
I need this GED.

1990
01:12:32,812 --> 01:12:33,978
You need to keep
your booty closed.

1991
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:35,446
That's what you need to do.
You in jail.

1992
01:12:35,448 --> 01:12:36,980
No, I need this GED.

1993
01:12:36,982 --> 01:12:38,181
We can't live
on Randy's salary.

1994
01:12:38,183 --> 01:12:39,417
Please don't make me go home.

1995
01:12:39,419 --> 01:12:40,753
I hate my kids.

1996
01:12:41,821 --> 01:12:44,288
But I love being a mom.

1997
01:12:44,290 --> 01:12:46,756
I'm blessed. I'm so blessed.

1998
01:12:46,758 --> 01:12:48,392
Carrie, please.

1999
01:12:48,394 --> 01:12:50,059
I cannot live a lifetime

2000
01:12:50,061 --> 01:12:52,129
of driving around drunks
in a Corolla.

2001
01:12:52,131 --> 01:12:53,497
Look, the last thing
I want to do

2002
01:12:53,499 --> 01:12:55,232
is be cleaning the rooms
at the Best Western.

2003
01:12:55,234 --> 01:12:56,433
Okay? 'Cause all that...

2004
01:12:56,435 --> 01:12:57,901
Especially
them short-stay rooms,

2005
01:12:57,903 --> 01:12:59,470
'cause you know
what that is, right?

2006
01:12:59,472 --> 01:13:01,505
That's just gonna be
used condoms, soiled sheets.

2007
01:13:01,507 --> 01:13:03,376
Ain't that where you met
your bottom bitch at?

2008
01:13:05,778 --> 01:13:07,744
You know Trina?

2009
01:13:07,746 --> 01:13:08,978
Mm-hmm.

2010
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:10,414
She got a fat ass, too.

2011
01:13:10,416 --> 01:13:13,283
You know what? All of you
got little sob stories,

2012
01:13:13,285 --> 01:13:14,985
but y'all should've thought
about that

2013
01:13:14,987 --> 01:13:16,989
before you went
and stole the test.

2014
01:13:19,258 --> 01:13:21,125
Just get the hell up out
of my class.

2015
01:13:24,763 --> 01:13:27,064
It's not sob stories. No!

2016
01:13:27,066 --> 01:13:28,499
I'm-I'm the one who wants
to get my life together.

2017
01:13:28,501 --> 01:13:30,267
Let-let-let me tell you
something about Jay.

2018
01:13:30,269 --> 01:13:33,102
Get out!

2019
01:13:33,104 --> 01:13:35,439
Get out! Get out!

2020
01:13:35,441 --> 01:13:36,973
- All of y'all...
- It was me.

2021
01:13:36,975 --> 01:13:38,074
And I... Hey.

2022
01:13:38,076 --> 01:13:39,912
It was me.

2023
01:13:42,281 --> 01:13:44,181
Shouldn't be mad
at none of them.

2024
01:13:44,183 --> 01:13:45,982
I mean, yeah,
they looked at the answers,

2025
01:13:45,984 --> 01:13:47,953
but they wouldn't have
if I hadn't put it on their lap.

2026
01:13:49,354 --> 01:13:51,222
I take responsibility
for it all.

2027
01:13:51,224 --> 01:13:53,224
I was the mastermind.
I orchestrated the whole thing.

2028
01:13:53,226 --> 01:13:54,227
It was all me.

2029
01:13:55,328 --> 01:13:56,826
Thank you.

2030
01:13:56,828 --> 01:13:58,562
Thank you, Teddy.

2031
01:13:58,564 --> 01:14:00,897
I appreciate your honesty.

2032
01:14:00,899 --> 01:14:02,866
I'm just trying
to do what's right, Carrie.

2033
01:14:02,868 --> 01:14:05,069
Now you can get the hell out
of my class.

2034
01:14:05,071 --> 01:14:07,003
Huh?

2035
01:14:07,005 --> 01:14:08,938
Hit the road, Jack.

2036
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:12,041
Don't let the doorknob hit you
where the good Lord split you.

2037
01:14:12,043 --> 01:14:13,543
I thought that when I said
all that stuff,

2038
01:14:13,545 --> 01:14:14,945
that you would listen to it.

2039
01:14:14,947 --> 01:14:16,113
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2040
01:14:16,115 --> 01:14:17,414
You gets no second chances
up in here.

2041
01:14:17,416 --> 01:14:18,582
Not with me no more.

2042
01:14:18,584 --> 01:14:20,417
Uh-uh. I ain't got
your back no more.

2043
01:14:20,419 --> 01:14:22,852
- You don't even want to be here.
- I do want to be here.

2044
01:14:22,854 --> 01:14:24,187
You don't even
want to be here, Teddy.

2045
01:14:24,189 --> 01:14:26,223
- No.
- And as for the rest of you,

2046
01:14:26,225 --> 01:14:27,924
I want you to think
long and hard

2047
01:14:27,926 --> 01:14:30,394
about if you really want this.

2048
01:14:32,130 --> 01:14:34,199
Class dismissed.

2049
01:14:36,968 --> 01:14:38,369
"Find a solution for the..."

2050
01:14:38,371 --> 01:14:40,069
I don't know none of this shit.

2051
01:14:40,071 --> 01:14:41,070
I need you.

2052
01:14:41,072 --> 01:14:44,474
- I need your help.
- Put your damn hand down.

2053
01:14:44,476 --> 01:14:46,276
I'm going to Rainbows
before they close.

2054
01:14:46,278 --> 01:14:48,444
That's emotional shopping,
Carrie.

2055
01:14:48,446 --> 01:14:50,147
It's Rainbows, motherfucker.

2056
01:14:50,149 --> 01:14:51,417
Shit is cheap.

2057
01:14:56,054 --> 01:14:58,421
Teddy, Teddy, Teddy.

2058
01:14:58,423 --> 01:15:00,922
You are stupid.

2059
01:15:00,924 --> 01:15:03,960
She didn't know what was
going on until you admitted it.

2060
01:15:03,962 --> 01:15:05,396
We had her right up
till the end,

2061
01:15:05,398 --> 01:15:08,431
and then Teddy,
old brick head...

2062
01:15:08,433 --> 01:15:10,900
Oh, Teddy!

2063
01:15:10,902 --> 01:15:12,368
You deserved that.

2064
01:15:12,370 --> 01:15:14,571
<i>A school?</i>

2065
01:15:14,573 --> 01:15:17,574
We've never taken on
a project like that.

2066
01:15:17,576 --> 01:15:20,510
Well, I am
an outside-of-the-box thinker.

2067
01:15:20,512 --> 01:15:22,278
That's just who I am.

2068
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:23,646
I think that if students
are excited

2069
01:15:23,648 --> 01:15:25,148
about their environment,

2070
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:27,083
they'll be excited
about learning.

2071
01:15:27,085 --> 01:15:28,284
That makes total sense.

2072
01:15:28,286 --> 01:15:29,653
I know I would.

2073
01:15:29,655 --> 01:15:31,120
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

2074
01:15:31,122 --> 01:15:32,455
If you're interested,
I'd love to give you

2075
01:15:32,457 --> 01:15:33,956
a tour of the school.

2076
01:15:33,958 --> 01:15:35,558
You could come by any day,
or you know what,

2077
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:37,125
you could even come
after school.

2078
01:15:37,127 --> 01:15:40,098
We have several
night programs as well.

2079
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:44,334
- Hey.
- Hey.

2080
01:15:44,336 --> 01:15:46,402
Okay, show me what you got.

2081
01:15:46,404 --> 01:15:48,003
Show me what you got!

2082
01:15:48,005 --> 01:15:50,206
What you got for me?
Come on.

2083
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:52,141
Light up. What you got?

2084
01:15:52,143 --> 01:15:54,043
Oh, you killing me!

2085
01:15:54,045 --> 01:15:55,578
You won. Congratulations.

2086
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:57,547
I'm proud of you, boo.

2087
01:15:57,549 --> 01:15:59,515
Now, it's not cool
that you beat your teacher

2088
01:15:59,517 --> 01:16:01,517
at Texas hold 'em,
but I like the way

2089
01:16:01,519 --> 01:16:04,020
you nailed down the
calculations on the pot odds,

2090
01:16:04,022 --> 01:16:06,255
so I'm gonna let this slide.

2091
01:16:06,257 --> 01:16:08,291
Now, remember what I said.

2092
01:16:08,293 --> 01:16:11,093
There are no shortcuts.
You gotta work your butt off.

2093
01:16:11,095 --> 01:16:13,128
Okay? Give me some love.

2094
01:16:13,130 --> 01:16:15,465
Mmm. So proud of you.

2095
01:16:15,467 --> 01:16:17,200
Go on and have a good day, now.

2096
01:16:17,202 --> 01:16:19,237
Maybe one day,
I'll take you to Vegas.

2097
01:16:26,311 --> 01:16:27,512
That was cool.

2098
01:16:29,347 --> 01:16:32,047
You know, uh, this used to be
the special ed classroom

2099
01:16:32,049 --> 01:16:33,316
when I went here.

2100
01:16:33,318 --> 01:16:34,950
It still is.

2101
01:16:34,952 --> 01:16:36,686
You teach special ed?

2102
01:16:36,688 --> 01:16:40,390
Special ed is one
of my sections.

2103
01:16:40,392 --> 01:16:42,926
It's one of my favorites,
actually.

2104
01:16:44,729 --> 01:16:48,296
You know, that kid reminds me
a lot of myself.

2105
01:16:48,298 --> 01:16:49,699
I couldn't do math for shit

2106
01:16:49,701 --> 01:16:51,401
when I was in school.

2107
01:16:51,403 --> 01:16:53,436
Difference is I didn't have
a teacher like you

2108
01:16:53,438 --> 01:16:55,671
that was willing
to stay behind and help me.

2109
01:16:55,673 --> 01:16:57,473
I know what you're doing,
Teddy.

2110
01:16:57,475 --> 01:17:01,009
And I admit it was
very cool of you

2111
01:17:01,011 --> 01:17:03,379
to take the fall
for your classmates,

2112
01:17:03,381 --> 01:17:04,580
but you're a hustler.

2113
01:17:04,582 --> 01:17:07,350
Trying to skate by
without doing the work.

2114
01:17:07,352 --> 01:17:09,151
You should know
you can't hustle me.

2115
01:17:09,153 --> 01:17:10,152
I do.

2116
01:17:10,154 --> 01:17:12,688
Okay? I-I do know that.

2117
01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:14,991
And I promise you I'm done.

2118
01:17:14,993 --> 01:17:16,526
I'm not hustling no more.

2119
01:17:16,528 --> 01:17:19,529
Night school is about
second chances.

2120
01:17:19,531 --> 01:17:21,329
And if I don't get
this second chance,

2121
01:17:21,331 --> 01:17:22,698
then it's over for me.

2122
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:25,233
Night school
is all that I have.

2123
01:17:27,372 --> 01:17:29,238
Please.

2124
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:31,707
I'll consider it
on one condition.

2125
01:17:31,709 --> 01:17:33,375
Whatever it is.

2126
01:17:33,377 --> 01:17:35,243
We get you tested.

2127
01:17:35,245 --> 01:17:37,581
For STDs? That's not an issue.

2128
01:17:39,083 --> 01:17:40,283
I don't mind that. I mean...

2129
01:17:40,285 --> 01:17:41,317
Goddamn it.

2130
01:17:41,319 --> 01:17:43,051
There was one time where, uh,

2131
01:17:43,053 --> 01:17:44,754
the condom popped 'cause I put
my balls inside of...

2132
01:17:44,756 --> 01:17:47,589
No, you idiot.

2133
01:17:47,591 --> 01:17:49,393
For learning disabilities.

2134
01:17:51,262 --> 01:17:54,397
Nobody cares about your
escapades with your bitches.

2135
01:17:54,399 --> 01:17:56,599
<i>So, what are the test results,</i>

2136
01:17:56,601 --> 01:17:57,599
Carrie?

2137
01:17:57,601 --> 01:18:00,237
Teddy, the issue is...

2138
01:18:01,538 --> 01:18:03,475
...you're clinically dumb.

2139
01:18:06,778 --> 01:18:08,510
I knew it.

2140
01:18:08,512 --> 01:18:11,112
I knew it was a mistake.
I knew it was a mistake.

2141
01:18:11,114 --> 01:18:13,548
Boy, I'm sorry.
I'm just messing with you.

2142
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:15,183
- Come on, Carrie.
- Look, look.

2143
01:18:15,185 --> 01:18:16,419
My suspicions were right,

2144
01:18:16,421 --> 01:18:19,421
and you, my friend,
are dyslexic.

2145
01:18:19,423 --> 01:18:21,323
Okay.

2146
01:18:21,325 --> 01:18:23,325
Okay, so that just means
I'm having problems

2147
01:18:23,327 --> 01:18:25,059
with my reading
and my writing, right?

2148
01:18:25,061 --> 01:18:27,730
Yep, but you also have
dyscalculia.

2149
01:18:27,732 --> 01:18:29,665
Discalcu... I don't even know
how to pronounce that.

2150
01:18:29,667 --> 01:18:33,003
Basically, it's like dyslexia
but with math.

2151
01:18:35,105 --> 01:18:36,538
That's what I got.

2152
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:38,073
I knew it.

2153
01:18:38,075 --> 01:18:39,742
Now that you say it,
it makes sense.

2154
01:18:39,744 --> 01:18:41,142
If you take me to a restaurant

2155
01:18:41,144 --> 01:18:42,377
and you say,
"Teddy, leave the tip,"

2156
01:18:42,379 --> 01:18:43,445
I'm-I'm all over the place.

2157
01:18:43,447 --> 01:18:44,613
That's exactly what it is.

2158
01:18:44,615 --> 01:18:46,448
- We did it.
- Oh, we're not done.

2159
01:18:46,450 --> 01:18:48,783
You also have
a processing disorder.

2160
01:18:48,785 --> 01:18:51,186
I got a touch
of prostate cancer?

2161
01:18:51,188 --> 01:18:53,255
She didn't touch my ass
one time.

2162
01:18:53,257 --> 01:18:55,257
I said "processing disorder."

2163
01:18:55,259 --> 01:18:57,526
Carrie, if you're not
going to help me,

2164
01:18:57,528 --> 01:18:58,827
then we're wasting our time.

2165
01:18:58,829 --> 01:19:01,363
Explain to me
what this stuff is.

2166
01:19:01,365 --> 01:19:02,598
If I got a proc...

2167
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:03,701
Oh, my God.

2168
01:19:05,302 --> 01:19:07,271
I'm not processing it.

2169
01:19:08,739 --> 01:19:11,138
I didn't process
none of that shit.

2170
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:14,376
You are just one big,
beautiful mixed drink

2171
01:19:14,378 --> 01:19:15,778
of learning disabilities.

2172
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:17,412
So I'm not dumb?

2173
01:19:17,414 --> 01:19:19,447
Boy, I was just playing
when I said that earlier.

2174
01:19:19,449 --> 01:19:22,350
No good teacher would ever
call their students dumb.

2175
01:19:22,352 --> 01:19:23,852
Okay.

2176
01:19:23,854 --> 01:19:25,820
So, how do we fix it?
Let's talk solution.

2177
01:19:25,822 --> 01:19:27,522
Well, there's no cure
for what you have.

2178
01:19:27,524 --> 01:19:29,824
Oh, my God.

2179
01:19:29,826 --> 01:19:32,160
I got learning herpes?

2180
01:19:32,162 --> 01:19:33,562
Boy...

2181
01:19:33,564 --> 01:19:34,829
Oh, shit.

2182
01:19:34,831 --> 01:19:37,197
There is no such thing
as learning herpes.

2183
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:39,267
I'm blistering up.

2184
01:19:39,269 --> 01:19:41,436
It's 'cause I'm trying
to think.

2185
01:19:41,438 --> 01:19:43,605
- Hey, Teddy!
- Hey, Mac.

2186
01:19:43,607 --> 01:19:45,607
- Ringleader.
- Hi, guys.

2187
01:19:45,609 --> 01:19:48,375
- Teddy!
- Yeah, Teddy! Teddy!

2188
01:19:48,377 --> 01:19:50,211
Teaching the conventional way

2189
01:19:50,213 --> 01:19:53,148
just isn't gonna
get it done for Teddy,

2190
01:19:53,150 --> 01:19:54,416
so we're gonna mix it up.

2191
01:19:54,418 --> 01:19:56,418
You out here getting it in.

2192
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:58,653
What's going on, Carrie?
Why you in here?

2193
01:19:58,655 --> 01:20:00,655
Why you in the ring?
What's going on?

2194
01:20:00,657 --> 01:20:03,458
Teddy, your difficulties
are focus-related.

2195
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:04,359
Uh-huh.

2196
01:20:04,361 --> 01:20:06,328
My goal is to remove
that mind chatter

2197
01:20:06,330 --> 01:20:09,497
so you can achieve properly
unencumbered neural pathways.

2198
01:20:09,499 --> 01:20:10,865
And this isn't a ring.

2199
01:20:10,867 --> 01:20:12,333
It's a hexagon.

2200
01:20:12,335 --> 01:20:14,269
Huh. Oh, it is.

2201
01:20:14,271 --> 01:20:15,403
Yeah, well...

2202
01:20:15,405 --> 01:20:16,871
Why you taking your shoes off?

the square root of 81?

2205
01:20:20,410 --> 01:20:21,576
What?

2206
01:20:21,578 --> 01:20:24,545
Ow! Ow!

01:20:27,217 --> 01:20:29,284
I don't know.
What you do...?

Don't make him say it again.

2285
01:22:58,768 --> 01:23:00,067
Okay.

2286
01:23:00,069 --> 01:23:02,436
Well, you can come
to college with me.

2287
01:23:02,438 --> 01:23:04,705
- What? You're going?
- Mm-hmm.

2288
01:23:04,707 --> 01:23:06,707
I'm so happy for you.

2289
01:23:06,709 --> 01:23:08,408
When did you decide?

2290
01:23:08,410 --> 01:23:09,610
Well, don't take this
the wrong way,

2291
01:23:09,612 --> 01:23:12,378
but hanging out with you guys
scared the shit out of me.

2292
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:14,548
So I think I'm gonna...

2293

01:23:15,651 --> 01:23:17,118
That's wonderful.

2295
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,887
I can just see you now
in the cutest outfit...

2296
01:23:19,889 --> 01:23:21,889
little miniskirt...
walking through the quad.

2297
01:23:21,891 --> 01:23:23,757
You're clutching
onto your philosophy thesis.

2298
01:23:23,759 --> 01:23:26,393
But when you get to class,
the professor is blown away

2299
01:23:26,395 --> 01:23:27,694
- by how brilliant it is.
- Yeah.

2300
01:23:27,696 --> 01:23:29,429
So he grabs onto you,
and you can

2301
01:23:29,431 --> 01:23:30,731
feel him up against your thigh.

2302
01:23:30,733 --> 01:23:32,432
- Uh...
- Not in a sexual way,

2303
01:23:32,434 --> 01:23:34,367
but not not in a sexual way,
you know?

2304
01:23:34,369 --> 01:23:36,702
And he looks strangely
like Bruno Mars.

2305
01:23:36,704 --> 01:23:37,939
Even though
he's super academic,

2306
01:23:37,941 --> 01:23:39,540
he wears, like,
pink blazers sometimes.

2307
01:23:39,542 --> 01:23:42,042
Well, you can still go
to college and do...

2308
01:23:42,044 --> 01:23:43,646
that other stuff.

2309
01:23:44,747 --> 01:23:46,013
Me? College?

2310
01:23:46,015 --> 01:23:47,613
Oh, no.
Randy wouldn't let me.

2311
01:23:47,615 --> 01:23:50,484
Screw Randy. You can do
whatever you want to do.

2312
01:23:50,486 --> 01:23:51,418
You don't know Randy.

2313
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:53,153
Why can't you just be like,
"Hey, Randy.

2314
01:23:53,155 --> 01:23:55,556
I want to do this.
Deal with it."

2315
01:23:55,558 --> 01:23:57,057
Okay!

2316
01:23:57,059 --> 01:23:59,458

2317
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:02,996

01:25:26,481 --> 01:25:29,182
And also, I want to have sex
on a regular basis.

2363
01:25:29,184 --> 01:25:30,650
- Oh.
- Mmm!

2364
01:25:30,652 --> 01:25:31,951
I mean, like, kinky sex.

2365
01:25:31,953 --> 01:25:33,220
Like, not make-a-baby sex,

2366
01:25:33,222 --> 01:25:34,787
but 45-minute sex.

2367
01:25:34,789 --> 01:25:36,155
Like, <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i> sex.

2368
01:25:36,157 --> 01:25:37,256
Hmm?

2369
01:25:37,258 --> 01:25:39,760
I want you
to crack my butt like a walnut.

2370
01:25:39,762 --> 01:25:40,961
Do I make myself clear?!

2371
01:25:40,963 --> 01:25:42,728
Okay, okay.

2372
01:25:42,730 --> 01:25:44,231
I'm so sorry, babe.

2373
01:25:44,233 --> 01:25:46,565
I think you're
a freakin' rock star.

2374
01:25:46,567 --> 01:25:48,668
And judging by what
you just said to me,

2375
01:25:48,670 --> 01:25:50,636
I can't wait to be
your porn star.

2376
01:25:50,638 --> 01:25:51,939
Whoa.

2377
01:25:53,841 --> 01:25:55,107
All right, y'all,

2378
01:25:55,109 --> 01:25:56,611
we got the party
up in here tonight!

2379
01:25:58,012 --> 01:25:59,845
That's a clean batch.

2380
01:25:59,847 --> 01:26:02,115
I want this punch
to stay that way.

2381
01:26:02,117 --> 01:26:04,884
Gonna be checking
throughout the night.

2382
01:26:04,886 --> 01:26:06,619
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

2383
01:26:06,621 --> 01:26:09,121
Excuse me. This dance
is for students only.

2384
01:26:09,123 --> 01:26:10,923
Well, this is
my night school class,

2385
01:26:10,925 --> 01:26:12,624
and they are students here.

2386
01:26:12,626 --> 01:26:13,894
Okay, well, technically,
technically, you're still

2387
01:26:13,896 --> 01:26:15,095
on school hours,
so, Miss Carter,

2388
01:26:15,097 --> 01:26:16,296
please return
to your classroom.

2389
01:26:16,298 --> 01:26:18,097
Well, we gonna spend
our class hours

2390
01:26:18,099 --> 01:26:19,999
- in the gym, at the party.
- Carrie.

2391
01:26:20,001 --> 01:26:21,734
So get out of the way,
bitch. Move!

2392
01:26:21,736 --> 01:26:23,635
- I can't allow this.
- She got you. She got you.

2393
01:26:23,637 --> 01:26:25,071
Man, why you always
about that rah-rah, man?

2394
01:26:25,073 --> 01:26:26,706
I'll allow this.
I'll allow this to happen.

2395
01:26:26,708 --> 01:26:28,208
We just trying

She said, "I want to be
a flight attendant."

01:28:46,347 --> 01:28:48,615
Is y'all little bitches
listening?

2452
01:28:50,017 --> 01:28:53,185
You know, Carrie,
you are incredible.

2453
01:28:53,187 --> 01:28:54,953
I'm serious.

2454
01:28:54,955 --> 01:28:55,854
There's never been a teacher

2455
01:28:55,856 --> 01:28:57,889
that believe in me
the way that you do.

2456
01:28:57,891 --> 01:28:59,724
Teddy, what can I say?

2457
01:28:59,726 --> 01:29:03,129
You've grown so much
in such a short period of time.

2458
01:29:03,131 --> 01:29:05,030
And if you keep up
with all the stuff

2459
01:29:05,032 --> 01:29:08,166
that we've been doing,
you are well on your way.

2460
01:29:08,168 --> 01:29:10,034
I'm just...

2461
01:29:10,036 --> 01:29:12,370
I'm really,
really proud of you.

2462
01:29:19,146 --> 01:29:21,946
You know, Carrie, uh...

2463
01:29:21,948 --> 01:29:25,250
these past few weeks
have been amazing.

2464
01:29:25,252 --> 01:29:27,852
I mean, our chemistry,
it goes without saying,

2465
01:29:27,854 --> 01:29:28,920
it's strong.

2466
01:29:28,922 --> 01:29:30,855
I sense it. I know you do, too.

2467
01:29:30,857 --> 01:29:32,123
But as magical as these moments

2468
01:29:32,125 --> 01:29:33,224
that we've been having
may be...

2469
01:29:33,226 --> 01:29:35,126
Fool, I'm gay.

2470
01:29:35,128 --> 01:29:36,727
I'm not trying to play.

2471
01:29:36,729 --> 01:29:38,063
Now, I'm not saying
I ain't no freak,

2472
01:29:38,065 --> 01:29:39,265
'cause I'd drop it off on you.

2473
01:29:39,267 --> 01:29:40,499
I'm a lesbian.

2474
01:29:40,501 --> 01:29:43,768
If you want to pursue acting,
you can.

2475
01:29:43,770 --> 01:29:45,103
No, I'm gay.

2476
01:29:45,105 --> 01:29:46,771
Say that again. It sound like
you said you're gay.

2477
01:29:46,773 --> 01:29:48,239
I'm gay.

2478
01:29:48,241 --> 01:29:50,409
I like women.

2479
01:29:50,411 --> 01:29:51,943
Are you sure?
Because I'm getting

2480
01:29:51,945 --> 01:29:53,479
- a whole different vibe.
- Oh, hell no!

2481
01:29:53,481 --> 01:29:55,715
- I'm pretty sure.
- Oh, God.

2482
01:29:57,117 --> 01:29:59,184
Teddy?

2483
01:29:59,186 --> 01:30:02,087
Is the, is the one on the left
your type?

2484
01:30:02,089 --> 01:30:03,821
Uh-uh, the one
in the tight dress is.

2485
01:30:03,823 --> 01:30:05,025
Shit, that's mine.

2486
01:30:06,092 --> 01:30:07,892
Hey.

2487
01:30:07,894 --> 01:30:09,894
There they go.

2488
01:30:09,896 --> 01:30:11,362
What are you doing here?

2489
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:13,198
Huh?

2490
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:15,166
What are you doing
at a high school prom?

2491
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:17,835
What, uh... what-what
are you doing here, babe?

2492
01:30:17,837 --> 01:30:20,271
Why you... why you here?

2493
01:30:20,273 --> 01:30:21,372
Principal Patowsky
is interested in us

2494
01:30:21,374 --> 01:30:23,807
redesigning the school,
so he asked us to stop by...

2495
01:30:23,809 --> 01:30:25,010
Oh, he did, huh?

2496
01:30:26,447 --> 01:30:28,313
Well played, Stewart.

2497
01:30:28,315 --> 01:30:30,448
You two know each other?

2498
01:30:30,450 --> 01:30:32,383
Ask Stewart.

2499
01:30:32,385 --> 01:30:34,452
Uh, yes, we went
to high school together.

2500
01:30:34,454 --> 01:30:37,187
I think I mentioned that
at our first meeting.

2501
01:30:37,189 --> 01:30:39,926
No. No, you didn't.

2502
01:30:41,294 --> 01:30:43,294
Teddy, I am so confused.

2503
01:30:43,296 --> 01:30:45,963
Why are you here?
And who is she?

2504
01:30:45,965 --> 01:30:47,798
I can explain.
It ain't what it look like.

2505
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:49,468
I'm in here
with a bunch of kids,

2506
01:30:49,470 --> 01:30:51,269
dressed in street clothes.

2507
01:30:51,271 --> 01:30:54,205
Then remember I blew out
the, uh, Barbecue Shack.

2508
01:30:54,207 --> 01:30:56,074
Fire took me out of that thing.

2509
01:30:56,076 --> 01:30:58,476
And now my windshield
was-was messed...

2510
01:30:58,478 --> 01:31:00,378
got me messed up about the car.

2511
01:31:00,380 --> 01:31:03,915
My brakes ain't working, 'cause
I backed into this, um...

2512
01:31:03,917 --> 01:31:06,184
She gay. She ain't even...

2513
01:31:06,186 --> 01:31:08,319
She ain't even
interested in me.

2514
01:31:08,321 --> 01:31:10,188
So... so...

2515
01:31:10,190 --> 01:31:11,389
Goddamn it.

2516
01:31:11,391 --> 01:31:12,457
Lisa.

2517
01:31:12,459 --> 01:31:13,559
- Not now. Not now.
- Wait.

2518
01:31:13,561 --> 01:31:14,828
Lisa.

2519
01:31:16,329 --> 01:31:17,829
Okay, Lisa.

2520
01:31:17,831 --> 01:31:19,197
Lisa, Lisa.

2521
01:31:19,199 --> 01:31:20,531
Lisa, can you listen, please?

2522
01:31:20,533 --> 01:31:22,533
Lisa, please just listen.

2523
01:31:22,535 --> 01:31:24,970
What?
What are you gonna say, Teddy?

2524
01:31:27,073 --> 01:31:29,073
I'm a high school dropout.

2525
01:31:29,075 --> 01:31:31,109
Okay? That woman in there,

2526
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:33,877
Carrie...
that's my night school teacher.

2527
01:31:33,879 --> 01:31:35,446
That's what I've been doing
all these evenings.

2528
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:37,282
I've been studying
to get my GED

2529
01:31:37,284 --> 01:31:39,185
so that I can get a job
at Marvin's.

2530
01:31:40,353 --> 01:31:41,986
So you don't work there now?

2531
01:31:41,988 --> 01:31:43,854
I don't...

2532
01:31:43,856 --> 01:31:45,490
I don't work there yet.

2533
01:31:45,492 --> 01:31:47,558
Right now I work
at a fast food restaurant

2534
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:49,594
called Christian Chicken,

2535
01:31:49,596 --> 01:31:52,130
where the chicken is Christian
for some reason.

2536
01:31:52,132 --> 01:31:53,231
Oh, wait. L-Lisa,

2537
01:31:53,233 --> 01:31:54,365
Lisa, Lisa, let me just

2538
01:31:54,367 --> 01:31:55,500
say this before you judge him.

2539
01:31:55,502 --> 01:31:57,167
It ain't that average chicken.

2540
01:31:57,169 --> 01:31:58,935
It's not the same fast food

2541
01:31:58,937 --> 01:32:00,971
that you be getting from
these other little hood spots.

2542
01:32:00,973 --> 01:32:03,308
It's got the flavor... I don't
know if they use a needle,

2543
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:05,078
- but they get the flavor...
- Jaylen, Jaylen, Jaylen!

2544
01:32:06,146 --> 01:32:07,345
How do you know my name?

2545
01:32:07,347 --> 01:32:09,514
My nigga be talking about you
in the class all the time.

2546
01:32:09,516 --> 01:32:12,249
He said you was bad.
I didn't know you was that bad.

2547
01:32:12,251 --> 01:32:14,052
We're Teddy's classmates.
I'm Theresa.

2548
01:32:14,054 --> 01:32:17,322
- That's Jaylen, Mila, Mackenzie, and Luis.
- Hey.

2549
01:32:17,324 --> 01:32:19,590
You remember me?
I-I was actually the waiter

2550
01:32:19,592 --> 01:32:22,593
at the restaurant when Teddy
pulled all of his pubes,

2551
01:32:22,595 --> 01:32:24,528
and then... and he put 'em
in the cheesecake

2552
01:32:24,530 --> 01:32:25,997
to get out of paying.

2553
01:32:25,999 --> 01:32:29,099
Now we're best friends.

2554
01:32:30,470 --> 01:32:32,404
Thank you for your honesty.

2555
01:32:34,506 --> 01:32:35,539
Honesty.

2556
01:32:35,541 --> 01:32:38,309
I know...

2557
01:32:38,311 --> 01:32:40,645
that this is a lot to take in.

2558
01:32:40,647 --> 01:32:41,679
Really?

2559
01:32:41,681 --> 01:32:43,380
But if you let me explain...

2560
01:32:43,382 --> 01:32:45,148
- No.
- If you just... if you let me explain...

2561
01:32:45,150 --> 01:32:47,086
No, Teddy, I'm done
with your explanations.

2562
01:32:48,954 --> 01:32:50,457
You lied to me
about everything.

2563
01:32:51,957 --> 01:32:53,090
Why?

2564
01:32:53,092 --> 01:32:55,025
To impress me?

2565
01:32:55,027 --> 01:32:57,194
Teddy, I make my own money.

2566
01:32:57,196 --> 01:32:59,529
You think I care about
what kind of car you drive

2567
01:32:59,531 --> 01:33:01,699
or what kind of watch
you have on?

2568
01:33:01,701 --> 01:33:04,101
That's not me.

2569
01:33:04,103 --> 01:33:06,203
If you think that,
then you don't know me.

2570
01:33:06,205 --> 01:33:07,504
That's not true.

2571
01:33:07,506 --> 01:33:08,605
If you don't know me,

2572
01:33:08,607 --> 01:33:09,673
then you couldn't truly love me.

2573
01:33:09,675 --> 01:33:11,343
That's not true, Lisa.

2574
01:33:14,514 --> 01:33:16,281
Don't come back
to the apartment tonight.

2575
01:33:19,451 --> 01:33:22,454
Well, maybe you could stay
with your night school friend.

2576
01:33:25,492 --> 01:33:27,527
Maybe she'd have
some use for this.

2577
01:33:28,661 --> 01:33:31,263
It's probably fake, right?

2578
01:33:35,033 --> 01:33:36,031
Lisa.

2579
01:33:36,033 --> 01:33:37,100
Lis...

2580
01:33:37,102 --> 01:33:38,170
Lisa!

2581
01:33:48,045 --> 01:33:49,980
I cut the crust off,

2582
01:33:49,982 --> 01:33:52,082
just how you like it.

2583
01:33:52,084 --> 01:33:53,650
Thanks, Ma.

2584
01:33:53,652 --> 01:33:57,587
You're not seriously skipping
that GED test, are you?

2585
01:33:57,589 --> 01:33:59,121
Yeah.

2586
01:33:59,123 --> 01:34:01,659
I mean, I was doing
all that stuff for Lisa.

2587
01:34:01,661 --> 01:34:04,327
If she's not around,
then what's the point?

2588
01:34:04,329 --> 01:34:06,463
My poor baby, I feel terrible.

2589
01:34:06,465 --> 01:34:09,499
Oh, Gladys, now,
stop coddling this boy.

2590
01:34:09,501 --> 01:34:11,133
You know, Theodore,

2591
01:34:11,135 --> 01:34:12,769
you're a grown-ass man.

2592
01:34:12,771 --> 01:34:14,739
You need to get
your shit together.

2593
01:34:14,741 --> 01:34:16,139
I know, Dad.

2594
01:34:16,141 --> 01:34:18,375
I mean,
you say you got dyslexia,

2595
01:34:18,377 --> 01:34:20,644
"dyscoglia."

2596
01:34:20,646 --> 01:34:22,144
Dyscalculia.

2597
01:34:22,146 --> 01:34:23,647
However you say it.

2598
01:34:23,649 --> 01:34:26,116
The issue is you're dishonest.

2599
01:34:26,118 --> 01:34:28,084
I don't blame that girl
for dumping you.

2600
01:34:28,086 --> 01:34:31,089
- Now, Gerald, that is enough.
- Uh-huh.

2601
01:34:32,324 --> 01:34:34,256
You know, maybe you're right.

2602
01:34:34,258 --> 01:34:36,292
Maybe I do deserve it.

2603
01:34:36,294 --> 01:34:37,461
You think?

2604
01:34:37,463 --> 01:34:40,063
I was being sarcastic.

2605
01:34:40,065 --> 01:34:42,399
I'll get your bed ready, baby.

2606
01:34:42,401 --> 01:34:44,201
Would you like a tuck-in?

2607
01:34:44,203 --> 01:34:45,404
Yes, please.

2608
01:34:46,605 --> 01:34:47,771
Thank you, Mom.

2609
01:34:47,773 --> 01:34:49,408
Anything for you, darling.

2610
01:34:55,180 --> 01:34:56,548
I failed.

2611
01:34:58,717 --> 01:35:00,986
I failed as a father.

2612
01:35:02,087 --> 01:35:03,655
A tuck-in?

2613
01:35:06,325 --> 01:35:08,558
Oh, my gosh, why'd he come
on the bus like that?

2614
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:10,562
- I don't know.
- He ain't got no friends.

2615
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:16,166
What's the problem?

2616
01:35:18,102 --> 01:35:19,603
Christian Chicken!

2617
01:35:19,605 --> 01:35:21,505
♪ Call me Mr. Pitiful...

2618
01:35:21,507 --> 01:35:23,506
Honk once if you love chicken.

2619
01:35:23,508 --> 01:35:26,276
Honk twice
if you love the Lord.

2620
01:35:26,278 --> 01:35:28,111
Come and get your chicken
if you...

2621
01:35:28,113 --> 01:35:29,646
ready to start winning.

2622
01:35:29,648 --> 01:35:31,113
Hey.

2623
01:35:31,115 --> 01:35:32,281
Sellout!

2624
01:35:32,283 --> 01:35:33,315
What?

2625
01:35:33,317 --> 01:35:34,784
You a sellout, man.

2626
01:35:34,786 --> 01:35:36,218
Brother, I'm just trying
to make an honest living.

2627
01:35:36,220 --> 01:35:37,420
Why don't you get off my back?

2628
01:35:37,422 --> 01:35:39,422
Go get a job
at the post office, then.

2629
01:35:39,424 --> 01:35:41,190
- Get your ass up out of here.
- What? Say it again!

2630
01:35:41,192 --> 01:35:42,325
Come on, man!

2631
01:35:42,327 --> 01:35:43,392
Go ahead with that.

2632
01:35:43,394 --> 01:35:44,628
Stay woke, brah.

2633
01:35:44,630 --> 01:35:47,698
Yeah, well, I see you ate the
chicken, you son of a bitch.

2634
01:35:50,235 --> 01:35:52,204
So, this is what
it's come to, huh?

2635
01:35:55,206 --> 01:35:57,206
You got some nerve, man.

2636
01:35:57,208 --> 01:35:58,543
Teddy, look.

2637
01:36:00,177 --> 01:36:02,812
I came here to apologize.

2638
01:36:02,814 --> 01:36:05,114
I'm on my break.

2639
01:36:05,116 --> 01:36:07,182
- I ain't got time for this.
- Teddy, please, just listen.

2640
01:36:07,184 --> 01:36:08,651
I don't want to hear nothing
you got to say, man.

2641
01:36:08,653 --> 01:36:09,485
No, please just listen to me.

2642
01:36:09,487 --> 01:36:10,619
I don't have nothing
to say to you.

2643
01:36:10,621 --> 01:36:12,655
I just... well, I have
something to say to you, okay?

2644
01:36:12,657 --> 01:36:13,757
- What? What?
- Give me 30 seconds, okay?

2645
01:36:13,759 --> 01:36:15,292
30 seconds. Go.

2646
01:36:15,294 --> 01:36:17,359
Listen, when-when we
were in high school,

2647
01:36:17,361 --> 01:36:18,795
you had everything
that I wanted.

2648
01:36:18,797 --> 01:36:20,496
You got 28 seconds left.

2649
01:36:20,498 --> 01:36:21,898
I had grades.
That's all I had.

2650
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:25,201
You-you had sports,
friends, girls.

2651
01:36:25,203 --> 01:36:26,836
- I sucked at all that.
- 20.

2652
01:36:26,838 --> 01:36:28,772
I was 27 when I got
my first hand job.

2653
01:36:28,774 --> 01:36:31,640
You're at one, but before I...
before I walk away,

2654
01:36:31,642 --> 01:36:33,208
I want to tell you that's sad.

2655
01:36:33,210 --> 01:36:34,343
- That's my point.
- I don't care.

2656
01:36:34,345 --> 01:36:35,444
- Why are you telling me?
- My point is...

2657
01:36:35,446 --> 01:36:37,814
I was a late bloomer,
and I was desperate and sad,

2658
01:36:37,816 --> 01:36:39,281
and I blamed you.

2659
01:36:39,283 --> 01:36:41,517
And the other night,

2660
01:36:41,519 --> 01:36:44,653
when I got my revenge,
it felt awful.

2661
01:36:44,655 --> 01:36:46,755
I got into education
to make a difference

2662
01:36:46,757 --> 01:36:49,326
in people's lives,
not to ruin them.

2663
01:36:49,328 --> 01:36:50,860
Also,

2664
01:36:50,862 --> 01:36:53,562
I told Stewart here
I'd beat his ass

2665
01:36:53,564 --> 01:36:55,464
if he didn't come
and apologize.

2666
01:36:55,466 --> 01:36:56,865
That is true.
That was a part...

2667
01:36:56,867 --> 01:36:58,400
part of it, a small part.

2668
01:36:58,402 --> 01:36:59,902
Okay, you know what, guys?

2669
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:03,640
I appreciate the whole
after-school special moment.

2670
01:37:03,642 --> 01:37:05,809
But understand that I am okay.

2671
01:37:05,811 --> 01:37:07,743
I am where I'm supposed to be.

2672
01:37:07,745 --> 01:37:09,378
- All right?
- Your destiny is to work

2673
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:11,447
at a fast food joint
next to a strip club?

2674
01:37:11,449 --> 01:37:13,883
Yes. All right,
if I stand in the right spot

2675
01:37:13,885 --> 01:37:16,285
in this parking lot,
I can smell cocoa butter

2676
01:37:16,287 --> 01:37:18,253
and fried chicken
at the same time.

2677
01:37:18,255 --> 01:37:20,789
And I don't know about you
guys, but that's a win for me.

2678
01:37:20,791 --> 01:37:23,325
- Teddy, l-listen to me. Ted...
- Ain't no "Teddy, listen."

2679
01:37:23,327 --> 01:37:24,727
You know I wasn't
gonna pass that test,

2680
01:37:24,729 --> 01:37:26,261
so don't sit here and act like

2681
01:37:26,263 --> 01:37:27,897
it wasn't gonna be
a different story.

2682
01:37:27,899 --> 01:37:29,331
And don't act like
you don't want

2683
01:37:29,333 --> 01:37:30,799
to be able to finally say
that I'm dumb.

2684
01:37:30,801 --> 01:37:31,667
No, you're not.

2685
01:37:31,669 --> 01:37:33,902
You can finally say it, Stew.
Say it.

2686
01:37:33,904 --> 01:37:35,971
Teddy...

2687
01:37:35,973 --> 01:37:38,507
you are a lot of things.

2688
01:37:38,509 --> 01:37:39,876
A hustler.

2689
01:37:39,878 --> 01:37:41,310
A liar.

2690
01:37:41,312 --> 01:37:42,845
You're very short.

2691
01:37:42,847 --> 01:37:45,314
- Mad loud, too.
- Mmm.

2692
01:37:45,316 --> 01:37:47,616
But you are not dumb.

2693
01:37:47,618 --> 01:37:50,987
Now, this suit you got on
is dumb as hell.

2694
01:37:50,989 --> 01:37:52,721
- I rebuke you.
- You...?

2695
01:37:52,723 --> 01:37:54,456
Rebuke. I rebuke you!

2696
01:37:54,458 --> 01:37:55,924
- Boy... give me this thing.
- I'm going to work.

2697
01:37:55,926 --> 01:37:57,626
Now, let me go back to...
What you doing?

2698
01:37:57,628 --> 01:37:58,861
- What you doing, man?
- Take this suit off,

2699
01:37:58,863 --> 01:38:00,930
- and you gonna take this test.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2700
01:38:00,932 --> 01:38:02,564
- No, let's use our words.
- You gonna take this test.

2701
01:38:02,566 --> 01:38:03,699
- All right, come here.
- You know what?

2702
01:38:03,701 --> 01:38:04,867
- What you doing?
- She has a belt.

2703
01:38:04,869 --> 01:38:05,734
She's got a belt!

2704
01:38:05,736 --> 01:38:07,469
- You gonna take this suit off.
- Hey!

2705
01:38:07,471 --> 01:38:08,871
Uh, guys, guys, guys, guys...

2706
01:38:08,873 --> 01:38:10,773
- You stop! You stay there!
- Get off me!

2707
01:38:10,775 --> 01:38:12,507
It's gonna hurt me more
than it's gonna hurt you.

2708
01:38:12,509 --> 01:38:14,643
Oh, God, I can't be
a part of this.

2709
01:38:14,645 --> 01:38:17,312
Gonna tear your ass up!

2710
01:38:17,314 --> 01:38:18,747
Okay, this seems like
a black thing,

2711
01:38:18,749 --> 01:38:20,816
so I-I'm just gonna
order us some food.

2712
01:38:20,818 --> 01:38:22,517
- All right! All right!
- Now, listen to me.

2713
01:38:22,519 --> 01:38:23,752
- You listening to me?
- Yes.

2714
01:38:23,754 --> 01:38:25,587
Now, you have worked
too hard to be

2715
01:38:25,589 --> 01:38:28,424
running around here
in a damn holy chicken suit.

2716
01:38:28,426 --> 01:38:30,359
- Okay?
- Yes.

2717
01:38:30,361 --> 01:38:32,393
Now, either you get in the car

2718
01:38:32,395 --> 01:38:34,763
and you take that test,

2719
01:38:34,765 --> 01:38:37,934
or I continue
to tenderize your ass!

2720
01:38:37,936 --> 01:38:39,437
Your choice.

2721
01:38:43,007 --> 01:38:45,475
- Are you ready?
- Good luck, guys.

2722
01:38:46,609 --> 01:38:48,342
- Yeah.
- I'm back.

2723
01:38:48,344 --> 01:38:49,914
Hey, Carrie.

2724
01:38:57,988 --> 01:38:59,888
- Teddy!
- Aw, Teddy's back.

2725
01:38:59,890 --> 01:39:01,657
Good to see you, bro.
What's up, Ted?

2726
01:39:01,659 --> 01:39:04,326
- Hey, Teddy.
- Teddy! Teddy!

2727
01:39:04,328 --> 01:39:05,326
Yes!

2728
01:39:06,463 --> 01:39:07,528
What up, king?

2729
01:39:07,530 --> 01:39:08,764
Come on, man.

2730
01:39:08,766 --> 01:39:10,698
Let's do this.

2731
01:39:10,700 --> 01:39:11,935
Our hero returns.

2732
01:39:14,939 --> 01:39:17,506
Okay. We're complete.

2733
01:39:17,508 --> 01:39:19,742
So let's turn on
those computers

2734
01:39:19,744 --> 01:39:21,476
and ace this thing.

2735
01:39:21,478 --> 01:39:22,577
Go.

2736
01:39:23,980 --> 01:39:26,081
Okay, robot.

2737
01:39:26,083 --> 01:39:28,719
You bowing down to a god today.

2738
01:39:33,656 --> 01:39:35,389
Good luck, everybody.

2739
01:39:47,104 --> 01:39:48,771
Ah.

2740
01:39:54,912 --> 01:39:56,579
Come on, Teddy.

2741
01:40:02,553 --> 01:40:03,786
<i>Focus.</i>

2742
01:40:03,788 --> 01:40:04,887
<i>Concentrate.</i>

2743
01:40:04,889 --> 01:40:06,521
<i>Get rid of that mind chatter.</i>

2744
01:40:07,992 --> 01:40:09,457
Come on. Focus.

2745
01:40:09,459 --> 01:40:11,492
- Focus!
- Oh, God!

2746
01:40:11,494 --> 01:40:13,028
Focus.
You better get it right.

2747
01:40:13,030 --> 01:40:15,365
Focus, focus, focus!

2748
01:40:42,959 --> 01:40:43,893
Yeah!

2749
01:40:45,929 --> 01:40:46,863
Shh.

2750
01:40:50,034 --> 01:40:52,834
Okay, everybody calm down,
all right?

2751
01:40:52,836 --> 01:40:54,902
The results will be in online
in just a minute.

2752
01:40:54,904 --> 01:40:59,106
- If you get over 145, you pass.
- She's right.

2753
01:40:59,108 --> 01:41:00,976
All right, you do the hard
work, you get rewarded for it.

2754
01:41:00,978 --> 01:41:02,476
No need to panic.

2755
01:41:02,478 --> 01:41:03,946
Hey, hey, hey.
The results just came in.

2756
01:41:03,948 --> 01:41:06,714
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my gosh. Uh...

2757
01:41:06,716 --> 01:41:08,950
I passed. I got a 146!

2758
01:41:08,952 --> 01:41:11,185
146! Nice! Yeah!

2759
01:41:11,187 --> 01:41:12,754
- Way to go.
- Yes!

2760
01:41:12,756 --> 01:41:14,022
Management, here I come, baby!

2761
01:41:14,024 --> 01:41:15,190
He deserved that.

2762
01:41:15,192 --> 01:41:17,859
- 168.
- Oh!

2763
01:41:17,861 --> 01:41:19,660
Swim big!

2764
01:41:19,662 --> 01:41:21,596
I don't have to do
housework anymore.

2765
01:41:21,598 --> 01:41:23,430
- I passed!
- Yay! Bobby passed.

2766
01:41:23,432 --> 01:41:24,766
- Bobby passed, y'all.
- Yes, Bobby.

2767
01:41:24,768 --> 01:41:26,567
165, B!

2768
01:41:26,569 --> 01:41:27,935
Way to go, man.

2769
01:41:27,937 --> 01:41:30,104
- I'm going to college.
- Yeah!

2770
01:41:30,106 --> 01:41:31,706
- She ready! - Hey!
- Proud of you, kiddo.

2771
01:41:31,708 --> 01:41:32,840
Proud of you, kiddo.

2772
01:41:32,842 --> 01:41:35,542
Guys. Guys.

2773
01:41:35,544 --> 01:41:37,980
I'm...
I'm gonna be a dental hy-enist.

2774
01:41:37,982 --> 01:41:39,780
"Hygienist."
He's saying "hygienist."

2775
01:41:39,782 --> 01:41:41,182
I'm gonna be
a dental hy-enist.

2776
01:41:41,184 --> 01:41:42,817
Yes. It's good for you, man.

2777
01:41:42,819 --> 01:41:43,918
Y'all ready for this?

2778
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:45,953
- What?
- Jay got a 146!

2779
01:41:45,955 --> 01:41:47,989
Jay got a damn 146!

2780
01:41:47,991 --> 01:41:50,092
- Same as you, fam! Yeah!
- Yeah!

2781
01:41:50,094 --> 01:41:51,726
- Yeah! We won this!
- Proud of you guys.

2782
01:41:51,728 --> 01:41:53,094
- You said it.
- What you got?

2783
01:41:53,096 --> 01:41:54,495
What you got? Come on, Teddy.

2784
01:41:54,497 --> 01:41:56,130
Come on, Teddy.

2785
01:41:56,132 --> 01:41:58,032
I can't. I can't check it.

2786
01:41:58,034 --> 01:42:00,067
Here, Carrie, here,
you check mine for me.

2787
01:42:00,069 --> 01:42:01,702
Oh, God.

2788
01:42:01,704 --> 01:42:02,937
I'm too nervous, man.

2789
01:42:02,939 --> 01:42:04,505
Come on.

2790
01:42:04,507 --> 01:42:06,107
Genius level.

2791
01:42:06,109 --> 01:42:07,942
That's right.

2792
01:42:07,944 --> 01:42:09,509
Whew!

2793
01:42:09,511 --> 01:42:11,012
Teddy, I'm sorry.

2794
01:42:11,014 --> 01:42:12,680
Come on, Carrie.
Don't play right now.

2795
01:42:12,682 --> 01:42:14,048
Just... just tell me the score.

2796
01:42:14,050 --> 01:42:15,516
Tell me what I got.

2797
01:42:15,518 --> 01:42:16,586
I'm not joking with you this...

2798
01:42:17,887 --> 01:42:19,122
You didn't pass.

2799
01:42:30,166 --> 01:42:32,768
I got a 117.

2800
01:42:34,170 --> 01:42:36,069
I'm sorry, Teddy.

2801
01:42:36,071 --> 01:42:37,772
It doesn't matter.
You know why?

2802
01:42:37,774 --> 01:42:40,608
Because this is a...
this is a minor setback

2803
01:42:40,610 --> 01:42:42,143
for a major comeback.

2804
01:42:42,145 --> 01:42:44,245
- Yes.
- I'm-a take the test again, guys.

2805
01:42:44,247 --> 01:42:46,713
- That's right. Yes.
- You should!

2806
01:42:46,715 --> 01:42:48,249
- I'm-a take the test again.
- You take it again!

2807
01:42:48,251 --> 01:42:49,216
You're taking it again.
That's right.

2808
01:42:49,218 --> 01:42:50,251
I said I'm-a take it again!

2809
01:42:50,253 --> 01:42:53,187
Oh, God, he's doing
that thing with his voice.

2810
01:42:53,189 --> 01:42:54,855
Yeah, I know.
I heard it, too.

2811
01:42:54,857 --> 01:42:56,589
I'm-a take the test again!

01:43:39,002 --> 01:43:40,334
I failed.

2835
01:43:40,336 --> 01:43:42,069
Wait a minute.

2836
01:43:42,071 --> 01:43:43,737
Wait, I passed.

A 178.
That's, like, college, right?

Thank you! Thank you!

<i>I don't deserve it!</i>

2852
01:44:20,675 --> 01:44:23,676
We, the class of 2018,
represent a generation

2853
01:44:23,678 --> 01:44:25,379
of forward-thinking,

2854
01:44:25,381 --> 01:44:28,115
rule-challenging,
fearless leaders.

2855
01:44:28,117 --> 01:44:30,717
Let us go forward from this day

2856
01:44:30,719 --> 01:44:32,819
with confidence
and with courage.

2857
01:44:32,821 --> 01:44:36,189
As we cross this stage,
let us do so with the knowledge

2858
01:44:36,191 --> 01:44:41,227
that with faith in ourselves,
nothing is impossible.

2859
01:44:41,229 --> 01:44:43,063
Thank you.

2860
01:44:48,036 --> 01:44:50,770
Beautiful and inspiring words.

2861
01:44:50,772 --> 01:44:51,938
Thank you, Mikayla.

2862
01:44:51,940 --> 01:44:53,340
Now, before we conclude,

2863
01:44:53,342 --> 01:44:55,241
I'm sure some of you
are wondering

2864
01:44:55,243 --> 01:44:59,312
why we have adult students
with us onstage.

2865
01:44:59,314 --> 01:45:01,148
Well, as you all know,

2866
01:45:01,150 --> 01:45:03,083
I am an innovator.

2867
01:45:03,085 --> 01:45:05,018
A maverick.

2868
01:45:05,020 --> 01:45:07,320
I don't play by the...

2869
01:45:08,723 --> 01:45:10,689
So I have decided,

2870
01:45:10,691 --> 01:45:12,926
for the first time
in Piedmont history,

2871
01:45:12,928 --> 01:45:14,328
to invite our
night school graduates

2872
01:45:14,330 --> 01:45:15,795
to join our seniors.

2873
01:45:15,797 --> 01:45:17,430
They have elected
one of their own

2874
01:45:17,432 --> 01:45:19,165
to speak on their behalf.

2875
01:45:19,167 --> 01:45:21,868
It is with great pride

2876
01:45:21,870 --> 01:45:24,104
that I introduce
Mr. Teddy Walker.

2877
01:45:25,274 --> 01:45:26,673
Hey, all right.

2878
01:45:26,675 --> 01:45:28,041
- Yeah!
- You got this, Teddy.

2879
01:45:28,043 --> 01:45:30,043
- You got this.
- Teddy! Teddy!

2880
01:45:30,045 --> 01:45:31,411
Teddy! Teddy!

2881
01:45:31,413 --> 01:45:34,680
Teddy! Teddy! Teddy!

2882
01:45:34,682 --> 01:45:36,014
Teddy! Teddy!

2883
01:45:36,016 --> 01:45:37,085
Teddy!

2884
01:45:39,821 --> 01:45:42,755
Uh, let me just start off
by telling you guys

2885
01:45:42,757 --> 01:45:44,126
a little something about me.

2886
01:45:45,460 --> 01:45:48,261
I'm Teddy Walker, and...

2887
01:45:48,263 --> 01:45:50,029
I'm a liar.

2888
01:45:51,867 --> 01:45:55,368
For years, I've been pretending
to be somebody else.

2889
01:45:55,370 --> 01:45:57,337
Somebody that I'm not.

2890
01:45:57,339 --> 01:46:02,275
And my reason for doing that
is because I was ashamed.

2891
01:46:02,277 --> 01:46:05,713
Ashamed that I didn't learn
like my classmates.

2892
01:46:07,115 --> 01:46:10,716
Ashamed that I couldn't
take a test.

2893
01:46:10,718 --> 01:46:13,753
Ashamed that I let my family
and my friends down.

2894
01:46:13,755 --> 01:46:16,923
I mean, I put so much time
and energy into creating

2895
01:46:16,925 --> 01:46:19,325
this fake version
of Teddy Walker

2896
01:46:19,327 --> 01:46:22,728
that I forgot the value that
went into learning in school.

2897
01:46:22,730 --> 01:46:24,931
I'm talking about honesty.

2898
01:46:24,933 --> 01:46:27,167
I'm talking about
accepting who you are.

2899
01:46:27,169 --> 01:46:28,968
And it wasn't until I met

2900
01:46:28,970 --> 01:46:32,372
my amazing night school
classmates and...

2901
01:46:32,374 --> 01:46:35,443
and a teacher
that actually believed in me...

2902
01:46:37,112 --> 01:46:41,447
...that I was able
to accept who I was.

2903
01:46:41,449 --> 01:46:43,516
As a loudmouth hustler
with a boatload

2904
01:46:43,518 --> 01:46:46,320
of learning disabilities.

2905
01:46:55,029 --> 01:46:57,829
You know, for any of you
who may have struggled

2906
01:46:57,831 --> 01:47:00,098
- to get it right the first time...
- Lisa. - Hi.

2907
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:02,402
...that I am living proof

2908
01:47:02,404 --> 01:47:06,972
that you can get it together
on a second chance.

2909
01:47:06,974 --> 01:47:08,807
I mean, I done had
a lot of chances.

2910
01:47:08,809 --> 01:47:10,209
Mm-hmm.

2911
01:47:10,211 --> 01:47:12,545
- 'Cause I messed up a lot.
- Mm-hmm.

2912
01:47:12,547 --> 01:47:15,415
But I made it
to the other side.

2913
01:47:15,417 --> 01:47:17,015
I mean, hell, we all did.

2914
01:47:17,017 --> 01:47:18,218
Ain't that right,
night school crew?

2915
01:47:18,220 --> 01:47:19,485
Hell yeah.

2916
01:47:21,956 --> 01:47:23,889
We all got second chances.

2917
01:47:23,891 --> 01:47:25,193
And to my dad.

2918
01:47:26,528 --> 01:47:28,194
He was... he was tough on me.

2919
01:47:28,196 --> 01:47:31,063
He said some things,
but he said it out of love.

2920
01:47:32,534 --> 01:47:34,099
Dad, I know
you ain't never mean it

2921
01:47:34,101 --> 01:47:35,500
when you used to say
some of the things

2922
01:47:35,502 --> 01:47:37,003
that you used to say.

2923
01:47:37,005 --> 01:47:38,338
You know,
you used to say stuff like,

2924
01:47:38,340 --> 01:47:40,506
"I wish I ain't never had you."

2925
01:47:40,508 --> 01:47:43,108
Or like, uh,

2926
01:47:43,110 --> 01:47:44,843
- "That was a waste of sperm."
- Oh!

2927
01:47:44,845 --> 01:47:46,511
- Oh.
- "Oh, God, if I could

2928
01:47:46,513 --> 01:47:48,814
get that nut back."
I remember you said that.

2929
01:47:48,816 --> 01:47:51,117
But all that stuff
was said out of love

2930
01:47:51,119 --> 01:47:52,884
to motivate me and push me.

2931
01:47:52,886 --> 01:47:54,920
And you thought
you didn't do good,

2932
01:47:54,922 --> 01:47:56,090
but look at me now.

2933
01:47:57,458 --> 01:48:00,192
Anything is possible!

2934
01:48:05,966 --> 01:48:07,866
I did it!

2935
01:48:07,868 --> 01:48:09,868
- Yeah! Hurray!
- Go, Teddy!

2936
01:48:09,870 --> 01:48:10,868
Hey, Dad.

2937
01:48:10,870 --> 01:48:12,137
I did it, Dad!

2938
01:48:12,139 --> 01:48:13,606
I told you.

2939
01:48:13,608 --> 01:48:14,940
What'd I tell you?

2940
01:48:14,942 --> 01:48:17,510
Okay. Okay.

2941
01:48:17,512 --> 01:48:19,911
Yeah!

2942
01:48:21,548 --> 01:48:24,450
Can't believe I took off work
for this shit.

2943
01:48:28,289 --> 01:48:31,056
Thank you, guys,
for the flowers.

2944
01:48:31,058 --> 01:48:33,927
Look what it says.

2945
01:48:36,398 --> 01:48:38,196
- Hey!
- Well, I definitely need the work.

2946
01:48:38,198 --> 01:48:40,434
- I need the money, so...
- That's, uh... that's Teddy.

2947
01:48:44,204 --> 01:48:46,038
When's the last time
you were in love?

2948
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:48,039
- I work. I have a job. I'm saving lives.
- Okay. Okay.

2949
01:48:48,041 --> 01:48:50,208
- Okay. You love your job.
- That's what I love to do.

2950
01:48:50,210 --> 01:48:52,377
Oh, there he is.

2951
01:48:52,379 --> 01:48:55,180
My little, smart,
dumb-ass brother.

2952
01:48:55,182 --> 01:48:56,315
I'm so proud of you.

2953
01:48:56,317 --> 01:48:57,582
- Oh, thank you.
- Yes.

2954
01:48:57,584 --> 01:48:59,251
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

2955
01:48:59,253 --> 01:49:00,486
- Thank you.
- Yes.

2956
01:49:00,488 --> 01:49:02,020
- Ah. Give me some, man.
- Ah! Congrats.

2957
01:49:02,022 --> 01:49:04,056
Thank you, man.
How do I look? Do I look smart?

2958
01:49:04,058 --> 01:49:05,490
You look unbelievable.
Let me see your smart face.

2959
01:49:05,492 --> 01:49:06,625
- Hmm.
- Hit it. One, two, three.

2960
01:49:06,627 --> 01:49:07,559
Show me the smart face.

2961
01:49:07,561 --> 01:49:08,527
- Yeah, it's still stupid.
- Show it to me.

2962
01:49:08,529 --> 01:49:10,228
- That's it. - I love it.
- Okay, that's fine.

2963
01:49:10,230 --> 01:49:11,463
- Okay. All right.
- That's all right.

2964
01:49:14,068 --> 01:49:16,136
Call me.

2965
01:49:18,238 --> 01:49:20,971
Hey.

2966
01:49:20,973 --> 01:49:22,276
That was a beautiful speech,
Teddy.

2967
01:49:24,110 --> 01:49:26,347
That's the guy
I fell in love with.

2968
01:49:28,615 --> 01:49:30,584
Then allow me
to reintroduce myself.

2969
01:49:32,985 --> 01:49:34,588
I'm Teddy Walker.

2970
01:49:36,055 --> 01:49:37,590
I'm a high school dropout.

2971
01:49:37,592 --> 01:49:40,127
I work at a fast food joint.

2972
01:49:41,228 --> 01:49:42,262
I live with my mom.

2973
01:49:43,364 --> 01:49:45,129
And I take the bus.

2974
01:49:45,131 --> 01:49:47,431
But I would love...

2975
01:49:47,433 --> 01:49:49,903
I would absolutely love it...

2976
01:49:52,005 --> 01:49:54,308
...if you would let me
take you on a date.

2977
01:49:56,976 --> 01:49:59,210
Nice to meet you, Teddy Walker.

2978
01:50:02,383 --> 01:50:04,982
I'd like that.

2979
01:50:04,984 --> 01:50:07,051
You're gonna have to pay
for everything

2980
01:50:07,053 --> 01:50:09,086
because I...
I don't have any money.

2981
01:50:09,088 --> 01:50:10,454
Oh, I figured.

2982
01:50:10,456 --> 01:50:12,524
I mean, like no money.

2983
