I'm sorry, what...
what was that last part?

631
00:21:33,837 --> 00:21:34,938
I said look around you.

634
00:21:43,446 --> 00:21:45,879
Excuse me for asking, but are
you doing a black voice?

635
00:21:45,881 --> 00:21:48,048
No, no. Not a black voice.

636

- You sure?
- I don't hear color.

from an amazing job in sales

to a job in finance,
and the only thing

640
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,826
that's really holding up
this transition

641
00:21:59,828 --> 00:22:02,295
is me not having my GED.

642
00:22:02,297 --> 00:22:04,264
So, I don't know,
I was thinking maybe I could

643
00:22:04,266 --> 00:22:06,400
get you to cross some T's,
dot some I's.

to getting your diploma.

No.

Yes.

I wish I could. I really do.

653
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:25,385
But you would have to go

654
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:28,755
to night school to learn
how to pass the GED test,

655

offer night school here.

don't have night school here?

Why would you say that?

692
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:53,940
I said that because Teddy and I
went to school together.

He is, quite frankly,
a terrible student,

that element in here.

00:32:43,803 --> 00:32:46,402
- Bitch.
- (SCOFFS)

942
00:32:46,404 --> 00:32:47,872
So, what's your story, guy?

943
00:32:47,874 --> 00:32:50,107
Um, my name is Luis Flores.

944
00:32:50,109 --> 00:32:52,375
I had a great job as a waiter.

945
00:32:52,377 --> 00:32:54,345
Lot of money in tips.

946
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,981
Until I was fired
without cause.

947
00:32:56,983 --> 00:32:58,716
No reason at all.

948
00:32:58,718 --> 00:33:00,285
(WHISPERS):
Fired.

949
00:33:01,653 --> 00:33:03,453
I don't know why...
I have no idea

950
00:33:03,455 --> 00:33:04,889
why he's looking at me.
I don't...

951
00:33:04,891 --> 00:33:06,423
It's fine.

952
00:33:06,425 --> 00:33:07,792
It's just a sign that it's time

953
00:33:07,794 --> 00:33:09,126
for me to do
something different.

954
00:33:09,128 --> 00:33:10,760
You see,
I came to this country

955
00:33:10,762 --> 00:33:12,562
from Mexico
to fulfill my dream

956
00:33:12,564 --> 00:33:13,797
of being a singer/songwriter.

957
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:15,532
Oh, like Julio Iglesias?

958
00:33:15,534 --> 00:33:18,035
No, not like Julio Iglesias.

959
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,737
He sucks.

960
00:33:19,739 --> 00:33:22,039
More like Justin Bieber

961
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:25,608
or Justin Timberlake
or T-Pain.

962
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:28,813
(LAUGHS)
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

963
00:33:28,815 --> 00:33:31,816
Aren't you a little old
to, like, be a pop star now?

964
00:33:31,818 --> 00:33:33,451
Aren't you a little young
to die?

965
00:33:35,121 --> 00:33:37,154
That's what's up.

966
00:33:37,156 --> 00:33:40,991
But now I'm going to become
a dental "hy-enist."

967
00:33:40,993 --> 00:33:43,894
'Cause I have great teeth.

968
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,895
So I think I'd be a natural.

969
00:33:45,897 --> 00:33:47,564
A what?

970
00:33:47,566 --> 00:33:49,467
Dental hy-enist.

971
00:33:50,702 --> 00:33:52,101
Maybe you should see one.

972
00:33:52,103 --> 00:33:55,638
'Cause, you know what,
pretty stinky, guys.

973
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,974
MAN:
All right. Hey, everybody.

974
00:33:56,976 --> 00:33:58,175
I'm Mackenzie.

975
00:33:58,177 --> 00:33:59,809
Uh, they call me Big Mac.

976
00:33:59,811 --> 00:34:01,678
Oh, we love McDonald's.

977
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,946
What?

978
00:34:02,948 --> 00:34:05,049
McDonald's?

979
00:34:05,051 --> 00:34:06,683
I'm sorry, what?

980
00:34:06,685 --> 00:34:08,620
From the burger joint,
Mickey D's.

981
00:34:09,888 --> 00:34:11,423
Ronald McDonald's.

982
00:34:12,691 --> 00:34:13,923
"Two all-beef patties,

983
00:34:13,925 --> 00:34:15,524
"special sauce,
lettuce, cheese,

984
00:34:15,526 --> 00:34:17,761
- on a sesame-seed bun."
- Hmm.

985
00:34:17,763 --> 00:34:19,629
Never heard of it?

986
00:34:19,631 --> 00:34:22,565
(WHIMPERS, GROANS)

987
00:34:22,567 --> 00:34:25,869
Ooh, it's gonna be
a long semester.

988
00:34:25,871 --> 00:34:28,171
- Go on.
- MACKENZIE: Well, anyway,

989
00:34:28,173 --> 00:34:32,508
uh, my knees and my back
are really jacked up

990
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:35,011
from working at He-Man Movers
for 30 years,

991
00:34:35,013 --> 00:34:38,815
so I decided to get my GED
so that I could move up

992
00:34:38,817 --> 00:34:41,218
to a management position,
get off the truck.

993
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,820
And my son...
we call him Little Mac...

994
00:34:43,822 --> 00:34:45,822
he has decided
to drop out of school.

995
00:34:45,824 --> 00:34:48,625
So I made a deal with him:
I get my GED,

996
00:34:48,627 --> 00:34:50,193
he gets his diploma.

997
00:34:50,195 --> 00:34:51,593
(CHUCKLES)

998
00:34:51,595 --> 00:34:53,630
Little reverse psychology.

999
00:34:53,632 --> 00:34:55,031
All right.

1000
00:34:55,033 --> 00:34:56,566
And what's your name?

1001
00:34:56,568 --> 00:34:58,234
Hey, yo, what up? I'm Bobby.

1002
00:34:58,236 --> 00:35:00,069
That's what...
that's what I'm talking about.

1003
00:35:00,071 --> 00:35:02,906
That's Illuminati.
That's what I'm saying.

1004
00:35:02,908 --> 00:35:04,807
See, the nigga here,
but he ain't here.

1005
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:06,643
It's like they watching you,

1006
00:35:06,645 --> 00:35:08,245
and you think
you watching them.

1007
00:35:08,247 --> 00:35:09,479
That's what they do.

1008
00:35:09,481 --> 00:35:11,014
So you got Bobby Digital.

1009
00:35:11,016 --> 00:35:12,849
He here, but he not.

1010
00:35:12,851 --> 00:35:14,217
That's Tupac Coachella.

1011
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:15,251
(CHUCKLING):
You know what I'm saying?

1012
00:35:15,253 --> 00:35:17,121
And he in the... You see?

1013
00:35:17,123 --> 00:35:19,223
- Y'all don't...?
- All right, um...

1014
00:35:19,225 --> 00:35:21,591
That probably ain't even
a real nigga. Hey.

1015
00:35:21,593 --> 00:35:23,793
Are you on crack?
It's-it's Skype.

1016
00:35:23,795 --> 00:35:26,595
(SIGHS) Whew, boy,
it's hard to be woke.

1017
00:35:26,597 --> 00:35:27,729
(CHUCKLES)

1018
00:35:27,731 --> 00:35:29,168
It's hard to be woke.

1019
00:35:30,502 --> 00:35:32,769
What is "woke"?

1020
00:35:32,771 --> 00:35:35,672
Okay, well, welcome, everyone.

1021
00:35:35,674 --> 00:35:36,773
Really nice. We've all met.

1022
00:35:36,775 --> 00:35:38,207
Well, we didn't, uh...

1023
00:35:38,209 --> 00:35:40,109
we didn't meet...
we didn't meet everyone.

1024
00:35:40,111 --> 00:35:42,211
- I didn't, uh...
- Teddy, uh, earlier,

1025
00:35:42,213 --> 00:35:44,047
you said, unlike these folks,

1026
00:35:44,049 --> 00:35:46,548
you're not a night school
type of person,

1027
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:49,551
so I didn't think you cared.

1028
00:35:49,553 --> 00:35:51,187
JAYLEN:
Is that right?

1029
00:35:51,189 --> 00:35:53,122
TEDDY:
Well, you didn't...

1030
00:35:53,124 --> 00:35:55,291
you didn't hear it right,
'cause I would never say that

1031
00:35:55,293 --> 00:35:57,260
about people that I don't know.

1032
00:35:57,262 --> 00:35:59,162
You know what?
This is a perfect segue.

1033
00:35:59,164 --> 00:36:01,530
I'll just follow your lead,
and I'll stand up.

1034
00:36:01,532 --> 00:36:03,031
I am Teddy Walker.

1035
00:36:03,033 --> 00:36:06,002
Uh, a little fun fact about me:
I actually went here.

1036
00:36:06,004 --> 00:36:08,738
- Oh.
- I'm also newly engaged.

1037
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,605
His fiancée is out
of his league.

1038
00:36:10,607 --> 00:36:11,740
I'm sorry, what?

1039
00:36:11,742 --> 00:36:12,841
Nothing. You're doing great.

1040
00:36:12,843 --> 00:36:14,110
I said, "Keep going.

1041
00:36:14,112 --> 00:36:15,811
Everybody loves you."

1042
00:36:15,813 --> 00:36:17,613
CARRIE: How does
your fiancée feel about

1043
00:36:17,615 --> 00:36:18,614
you being in night school?

1044
00:36:18,616 --> 00:36:19,782
(HIGH-PITCHED):
Oh, she good.

1045
00:36:19,784 --> 00:36:21,918
She loves it.

1046
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,919
(CHUCKLES)
He ain't told her shit.

1047
00:36:23,921 --> 00:36:25,121
TEDDY:
She loves it.

1048
00:36:25,123 --> 00:36:26,655
I noticed that your voice

1049
00:36:26,657 --> 00:36:28,156
just went up a whole octave.

1050
00:36:28,158 --> 00:36:31,626
Now, from my studies
of psychology in grad school,

1051
00:36:31,628 --> 00:36:34,563
I know that that means
that you're bullshitting.

1052
00:36:34,565 --> 00:36:35,931
Ain't no bullshit in me.

1053
00:36:35,933 --> 00:36:37,899
I tell you what...
if you're lying with her,

1054
00:36:37,901 --> 00:36:40,068
- don't lie to her.
- But I don't... I don't lie.

1055
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,738
Sound like some bullshit to me.

1056
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,006
Everyone sees
right through you.

1057
00:36:43,008 --> 00:36:44,573
- Okay, how about we...?
- Mm-hmm.

1058
00:36:44,575 --> 00:36:46,641
If we go by your theory
about the voice thing...

1059
00:36:46,643 --> 00:36:47,976
I think that we're...
I think that we're all

1060
00:36:47,978 --> 00:36:49,278
- getting off track.
- ...he's lied four times.

1061
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,079
This boy definitely lying.

1062
00:36:51,081 --> 00:36:53,116
- I am not.
- You can't outsmart Mother Nature.

1063
00:36:53,118 --> 00:36:54,350
And that's what...
that-that's what a woman is.

1064
00:36:54,352 --> 00:36:56,685
- Brother.
- Especially a black woman.

1065
00:36:56,687 --> 00:36:57,987
- You know, how...
- That's correct.

1066
00:36:57,989 --> 00:36:59,921
- Girls are smart, dude.
- Goddamn it.

1067
00:36:59,923 --> 00:37:00,756
- Like, literally, damn it.
- (OTHERS MURMURING)

1068
00:37:00,758 --> 00:37:02,624
Even if he didn't tell her,
so what?

1069
00:37:02,626 --> 00:37:03,692
- Okay, here's the thing.
- I told Randy

1070
00:37:03,694 --> 00:37:05,762
that he was the first guy
I slept with... not true.

1071
00:37:05,764 --> 00:37:07,330
Hey, I'm trying to introduce
myself, and I can't...

1072
00:37:07,332 --> 00:37:09,198
You don't respect your queen,
'cause if you did,

1073
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,866
- that bitch would know where you at.
- Okay.

1074
00:37:10,868 --> 00:37:12,268
Teddy.

1075
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,235
Don't lie to your queen.

1076
00:37:13,237 --> 00:37:14,369
- Okay, guys.
- JAYLEN: If you're busting off

1077
00:37:14,371 --> 00:37:17,140
in her guts like that,
she might be carrying your seed.

1078
00:37:17,142 --> 00:37:18,274
I feel like
this conversation...

1079
00:37:18,276 --> 00:37:19,841
So you ain't just lying to her;
you lying to your child.

1080
00:37:19,843 --> 00:37:21,044
- Shit!
- If it's your bottom bitch,

1081
00:37:21,046 --> 00:37:22,044
she know you stupid, fam.

1082
00:37:22,046 --> 00:37:24,046
- All I'm saying, fam, look-look...
- Forget it.

1083
00:37:24,048 --> 00:37:26,114
- Okay.
- How your fiancée don't know where you at?

1084
00:37:26,116 --> 00:37:27,682
It's after dark. (CHUCKLES)

1085
00:37:27,684 --> 00:37:28,851
This ain't Halloween, fam.

1086
00:37:28,853 --> 00:37:29,986
I'm done.

1087
00:37:29,988 --> 00:37:32,221
My sister know
where I'm at, okay?

1088
00:37:32,223 --> 00:37:34,623
And she live all the way
in Arkansas.

1089
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:36,825
Okay. Here's the deal, class.

1090
00:37:36,827 --> 00:37:39,728
You will be given homework
every night

1091
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,197
just like regular high school.

1092
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:42,764
- (GROANS)
- And now...

1093
00:37:42,766 --> 00:37:44,267
a pop quiz

1094
00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:47,936
just so I can get a better idea
of where you all are.

1095
00:37:47,938 --> 00:37:50,005
Wait, wait. We got a...
we got a test on the first day?

that high.

Take that 15 feet,

01:04:31,366 --> 01:04:33,233
minus the three feet
that you can jump.

1884

the Pythagorean theorem.

1888
01:04:40,776 --> 01:04:41,976
in order to do
the Pythagorean theorem,

1889
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:43,743
you-you have to know
the hypotenuse.

1890
01:04:43,745 --> 01:04:46,346
All we gotta do
is hypotenuse it.

1891
01:04:46,348 --> 01:04:47,947
A-squared plus B-squared
equals C-squared.

1892
01:04:47,949 --> 01:04:49,716
If you know... know two sides,

1893
01:04:49,718 --> 01:04:51,018
then that'll help you
figure out the third,

1894
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:52,686
so it's roughly
six feet across,

1895
01:04:52,688 --> 01:04:55,388
and 15-squared is 225
divided by six-squared...

1896
01:04:55,390 --> 01:04:56,890

- Stewart.

01:09:32,699 --> 01:09:33,932
Hey.

2027
01:09:33,934 --> 01:09:35,067
Stewart,
you were saying "Teddy"?

2028
01:09:35,069 --> 01:09:36,268
About ten times.

2029

- Hey.
- Hey.

- Do me a favor.
- Yep.

2031
01:09:38,639 --> 01:09:40,539
Uh, go over there
and handle that situation

2032
01:09:40,541 --> 01:09:41,472
- at the drive-through.
- Uh-huh.

2033
01:09:41,474 --> 01:09:42,975
And I'll tell you
what to do after that,

2034
01:09:42,977 --> 01:09:44,042
because I'm in charge.

- Hey, so...
- WOMAN: Hello?

2036

Give me a second. M-Ma'am...

2037
01:09:47,547 --> 01:09:49,013
- I said I didn't want the pie.
- Okay, ma'am, ma...

2038
01:09:49,015 --> 01:09:49,947
- She don't want the pie.
- Uh-uh.

2039
01:09:49,949 --> 01:09:51,850
Take the pie off.
She want to get the...

2040

- You heard me.

2042
01:09:54,221 --> 01:09:55,686
- Pull up to the window!
- All right.

2043
01:09:55,688 --> 01:09:57,022
TEDDY:
When she pull up, tell me,

2044

the baby in the face.

Just let me know.

Hey, talk to me, man.
How you doing?

2047
01:10:05,065 --> 01:10:07,065
You know, I thought
it was the Woodbridge punks

2048
01:10:07,067 --> 01:10:09,800
that broke into the school,
but now it all makes sense.

2049
01:10:09,802 --> 01:10:12,903
I found this

2050
01:10:12,905 --> 01:10:14,508
at the scene of the crime.

2051
01:10:15,876 --> 01:10:17,242
So, what'd you do, huh?

2052
01:10:17,244 --> 01:10:18,310
Break into my computer?

2053
01:10:18,312 --> 01:10:20,145
- (CHUCKLES)
- Steal the midterm?

2054
01:10:20,147 --> 01:10:21,712
Being a little paranoid,
aren't we, Stew?

2055
01:10:21,714 --> 01:10:23,315
- Am I?
- Stewart, that's a plastic bag

2056
01:10:23,317 --> 01:10:25,649
with a chicken wrapper in it
with the word "evidence"

2057
01:10:25,651 --> 01:10:28,053
written on it, which is
probably in your handwriting.

2058
01:10:28,055 --> 01:10:31,123
It's not exactly
a smoking gun, Stew.

2059
01:10:31,125 --> 01:10:33,158
It's just a coincidence, right?

2060
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,259
Probably.

2061
01:10:34,261 --> 01:10:36,027
If you stole that test,

2062
01:10:36,029 --> 01:10:37,862
I will find out, Teddy.

to make an honest living.

Uh... whoa.

2069
01:10:52,879 --> 01:10:55,247
Carrie, those are
very strong accusations.

2070
01:10:55,249 --> 01:10:57,382
For real. Like, what?

2071

I'm offended.

Well, I'll take note
of that, Teddy.

Which one of you want
to own up to it?

That's why you in jail.

this whole thing?

pick on me and profile me?

I'm the only one
locked up here.

So, if I'm locked up in here,

2083
01:11:18,838 --> 01:11:21,372
how can I be out there
stealing the test, Miss Carrie?

how you got a perfect score?

I know I didn't get
a perfect score,

01:14:26,225 --> 01:14:27,924
I want you to think
long and hard

2181
01:14:27,926 --> 01:14:30,394
about if you really want this.

(CRYING):
I don't know none of this shit.

2186
01:14:40,071 --> 01:14:41,070
I need you.

2187
01:14:41,072 --> 01:14:44,474
- I need your help.
- Put your damn hand down.

2188
01:14:44,476 --> 01:14:46,276
I'm going to Rainbows
before they close.

2189
01:14:46,278 --> 01:14:48,444
That's emotional shopping,
Carrie.

2190
01:14:48,446 --> 01:14:50,147
It's Rainbows, motherfucker.

2191
01:14:50,149 --> 01:14:51,417
Shit is cheap.

2192
01:14:53,419 --> 01:14:56,052
(LONG SIGH)

01:14:56,054 --> 01:14:58,421

01:14:58,423 --> 01:15:00,922
You are stupid.

2195
01:15:00,924 --> 01:15:03,960
She didn't know what was
going on until you admitted it.

2196
01:15:03,962 --> 01:15:05,396
We had her right up
till the end,

2197
01:15:05,398 --> 01:15:08,431
and then Teddy,
old brick head...

01:15:08,433 --> 01:15:10,900
- (BOOK STRIKES MACKENZIE)
- Oh, Teddy!

01:15:10,902 --> 01:15:12,368
JAYLEN:
You deserved that.

2200
01:15:12,370 --> 01:15:14,571
LISA:
<i>A school?</i>

2201
01:15:14,573 --> 01:15:17,574
We've never taken on
a project like that.

2202
01:15:17,576 --> 01:15:20,510
STEWART: Well, I am
an outside-of-the-box thinker.

2203
01:15:20,512 --> 01:15:22,278
That's just who I am.

2204
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:23,646
I think that if students
are excited

2205
01:15:23,648 --> 01:15:25,148
about their environment,

2206
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:27,083
they'll be excited
about learning.

2207
01:15:27,085 --> 01:15:28,284
That makes total sense.

2208
01:15:28,286 --> 01:15:29,653
I know I would.

2209
01:15:29,655 --> 01:15:31,120
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

2210
01:15:31,122 --> 01:15:32,455
If you're interested,
I'd love to give you

2211
01:15:32,457 --> 01:15:33,956
a tour of the school.

2212
01:15:33,958 --> 01:15:35,558
You could come by any day,
or you know what,

2213
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:37,125
you could even come
after school.

2214
01:15:37,127 --> 01:15:40,098
We have several
night programs as well.

2215
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:44,334
- Hey.
- Hey.

2216
01:15:44,336 --> 01:15:46,402
CARRIE (IN DISTANCE):
Okay, show me what you got.

2217
01:15:46,404 --> 01:15:48,003
Show me what you got!

2218
01:15:48,005 --> 01:15:50,206
What you got for me?
Come on.

2219
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:52,141
Light up. What you got?

2220
01:15:52,143 --> 01:15:54,043
Oh, you killing me!

2221
01:15:54,045 --> 01:15:55,578
You won. Congratulations.

2222
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:57,547
I'm proud of you, boo.

2223
01:15:57,549 --> 01:15:59,515
Now, it's not cool
that you beat your teacher

2224
01:15:59,517 --> 01:16:01,517
at Texas hold 'em,
but I like the way

2225
01:16:01,519 --> 01:16:04,020
you nailed down the
calculations on the pot odds,

2226
01:16:04,022 --> 01:16:06,255
so I'm gonna let this slide.

2227
01:16:06,257 --> 01:16:08,291
Now, remember what I said.

2228
01:16:08,293 --> 01:16:11,093
There are no shortcuts.
You gotta work your butt off.

2229
01:16:11,095 --> 01:16:13,128
Okay? Give me some love.

2230
01:16:13,130 --> 01:16:15,465
Mmm. So proud of you.

2231
01:16:15,467 --> 01:16:17,200
Go on and have a good day, now.

2232
01:16:17,202 --> 01:16:19,237
Maybe one day,
I'll take you to Vegas.

2234
01:16:26,311 --> 01:16:27,512
That was cool.

2235
01:16:29,347 --> 01:16:32,047
You know, uh, this used to be
the special ed classroom

2236
01:16:32,049 --> 01:16:33,316
when I went here.

2237
01:16:33,318 --> 01:16:34,950
It still is.

2238
01:16:34,952 --> 01:16:36,686
You teach special ed?

2239
01:16:36,688 --> 01:16:40,390
Special ed is one
of my sections.

2240
01:16:40,392 --> 01:16:42,926
It's one of my favorites,
actually.

2241
01:16:44,729 --> 01:16:48,296
You know, that kid reminds me
a lot of myself.

2242
01:16:48,298 --> 01:16:49,699
(CHUCKLES)
I couldn't do math for shit

2243
01:16:49,701 --> 01:16:51,401
when I was in school.

2244
01:16:51,403 --> 01:16:53,436
Difference is I didn't have
a teacher like you

2245
01:16:53,438 --> 01:16:55,671
that was willing
to stay behind and help me.

2246
01:16:55,673 --> 01:16:57,473
I know what you're doing,
Teddy.

2247
01:16:57,475 --> 01:17:01,009
And I admit it was
very cool of you

2248
01:17:01,011 --> 01:17:03,379
to take the fall
for your classmates,

2249
01:17:03,381 --> 01:17:04,580
but you're a hustler.

2250
01:17:04,582 --> 01:17:07,350
Trying to skate by
without doing the work.

2251
01:17:07,352 --> 01:17:09,151
You should know
you can't hustle me.

2252
01:17:09,153 --> 01:17:10,152
I do.

2253
01:17:10,154 --> 01:17:12,688
Okay? I-I do know that.

2254
01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:14,991
And I promise you I'm done.

2255
01:17:14,993 --> 01:17:16,526
I'm not hustling no more.

2256
01:17:16,528 --> 01:17:19,529
Night school is about
second chances.

2257
01:17:19,531 --> 01:17:21,329
And if I don't get
this second chance,

2258
01:17:21,331 --> 01:17:22,698
then it's over for me.

2259
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:25,233

is all that I have.

I'll consider it
on one condition.

2263
01:17:31,709 --> 01:17:33,375
Whatever it is.

2264
01:17:33,377 --> 01:17:35,243
We get you tested.

2265
01:17:35,245 --> 01:17:37,581
For STDs? That's not an issue.

2266
01:17:39,083 --> 01:17:40,283
I don't mind that. I mean...

2267
01:17:40,285 --> 01:17:41,317
(SIGHS) Goddamn it.

2268
01:17:41,319 --> 01:17:43,051
There was one time where, uh,

my balls inside of...

2274
01:17:56,601 --> 01:17:57,599
Carrie?

2275
01:17:57,601 --> 01:18:00,237
Teddy, the issue is...

2276
01:18:01,538 --> 01:18:03,475
...you're clinically dumb.

2277
01:18:06,778 --> 01:18:08,510
I knew it.

2278
01:18:08,512 --> 01:18:11,112
I knew it was a mistake.
I knew it was a mistake.

2279
01:18:11,114 --> 01:18:13,548
(LAUGHS) Boy, I'm sorry.
I'm just messing with you.

2280
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:15,183
- Come on, Carrie.
- Look, look.

2281
01:18:15,185 --> 01:18:16,419
My suspicions were right,

2282
01:18:16,421 --> 01:18:19,421
and you, my friend,
are dyslexic.

2283
01:18:19,423 --> 01:18:21,323
Okay.

2284
01:18:21,325 --> 01:18:23,325
Okay, so that just means
I'm having problems

2285
01:18:23,327 --> 01:18:25,059
with my reading
and my writing, right?

2286
01:18:25,061 --> 01:18:27,730
Yep, but you also have
dyscalculia.

2287
01:18:27,732 --> 01:18:29,665
Discalcu... I don't even know
how to pronounce that.

2288
01:18:29,667 --> 01:18:33,003
Basically, it's like dyslexia
but with math.

2289
01:18:35,105 --> 01:18:36,538
That's what I got.

2290
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:38,073
I knew it.

2291
01:18:38,075 --> 01:18:39,742
Now that you say it,
it makes sense.

2292
01:18:39,744 --> 01:18:41,142
If you take me to a restaurant

2293
01:18:41,144 --> 01:18:42,377
and you say,
"Teddy, leave the tip,"

2294
01:18:42,379 --> 01:18:43,445
I'm-I'm all over the place.

2295
01:18:43,447 --> 01:18:44,613
That's exactly what it is.

2296
01:18:44,615 --> 01:18:46,448
- We did it.
- Oh, we're not done.

2297
01:18:46,450 --> 01:18:48,783
You also have
a processing disorder.

2298
01:18:48,785 --> 01:18:51,186
I got a touch
of prostate cancer?

2299
01:18:51,188 --> 01:18:53,255
She didn't touch my ass
one time.

2300
01:18:53,257 --> 01:18:55,257
I said "processing disorder."

2301
01:18:55,259 --> 01:18:57,526
Carrie, if you're not
going to help me,

2302
01:18:57,528 --> 01:18:58,827
then we're wasting our time.

2303
01:18:58,829 --> 01:19:01,363
Explain to me
what this stuff is.

2304
01:19:01,365 --> 01:19:02,598
If I got a proc...

2305
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:03,701
Oh, my God.

2306
01:19:05,302 --> 01:19:07,271
I'm not processing it.

2307
01:19:08,739 --> 01:19:11,138
I didn't process
none of that shit.

2308
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:14,376
You are just one big,
beautiful mixed drink

2309

2310
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:17,412
So I'm not dumb?

2311
01:19:17,414 --> 01:19:19,447
Boy, I was just playing
when I said that earlier.

2312
01:19:19,449 --> 01:19:22,350
No good teacher would ever
call their students dumb.

2313
01:19:22,352 --> 01:19:23,852
Okay.

2314
01:19:23,854 --> 01:19:25,820
So, how do we fix it?
Let's talk solution.

2315
01:19:25,822 --> 01:19:27,522
Well, there's no cure
for what you have.

2316
01:19:27,524 --> 01:19:29,824
Oh, my God.

2317
01:19:29,826 --> 01:19:32,160
I got learning herpes?

2318
01:19:32,162 --> 01:19:33,562
Boy...

2319
01:19:33,564 --> 01:19:34,829
Oh, shit.

2320
01:19:34,831 --> 01:19:37,197
There is no such thing
as learning herpes.

2321
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:39,267
I'm blistering up.

2322
01:19:39,269 --> 01:19:41,436
It's 'cause I'm trying
to think.

2323
01:19:41,438 --> 01:19:43,605
- Hey, Teddy!
- Hey, Mac.

2324
01:19:43,607 --> 01:19:45,607
- Ringleader.
- Hi, guys.

2325
01:19:45,609 --> 01:19:48,375
- Teddy!
- Yeah, Teddy! Teddy!

2326
01:19:48,377 --> 01:19:50,211
Teaching the conventional way

2327
01:19:50,213 --> 01:19:53,148
just isn't gonna
get it done for Teddy,

2328
01:19:53,150 --> 01:19:54,416
so we're gonna mix it up.

2329
01:19:54,418 --> 01:19:56,418
You out here getting it in.

2330
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:58,653
What's going on, Carrie?
Why you in here?

2331
01:19:58,655 --> 01:20:00,655
Why you in the ring?
What's going on?

2332
01:20:00,657 --> 01:20:03,458
Teddy, your difficulties
are focus-related.

2333
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:04,359
Uh-huh.

2334
01:20:04,361 --> 01:20:06,328
My goal is to remove
that mind chatter

2335
01:20:06,330 --> 01:20:09,497
so you can achieve properly
unencumbered neural pathways.

2336
01:20:09,499 --> 01:20:10,865
And this isn't a ring.

2337

Uh, yes, we went
to high school together.

2650
01:30:34,454 --> 01:30:37,187
I think I mentioned that
at our first meeting.

No. No, you didn't.

2652

Teddy, I am so confused.

2653
01:30:43,296 --> 01:30:45,963
Why are you here?
And who is she?

2654
01:30:45,965 --> 01:30:47,798
I can explain.
It ain't what it look like.

2655
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:49,468
I'm in here
with a bunch of kids,

dressed in street clothes.

2657
01:30:51,271 --> 01:30:54,205
Then remember I blew out
the, uh, Barbecue Shack.

2658
01:30:54,207 --> 01:30:56,074
Fire took me out of that thing.

2659
01:30:56,076 --> 01:30:58,476
And now my windshield
was-was messed...

2660
01:30:58,478 --> 01:31:00,378
got me messed up about the car.

2661

I backed into this, um...

at the restaurant when Teddy
pulled all of his pubes,

2701

and then... and he put 'em
in the cheesecake

- My point is...

I was a late bloomer,
and I was desperate and sad,

and I blamed you.

it felt awful.
