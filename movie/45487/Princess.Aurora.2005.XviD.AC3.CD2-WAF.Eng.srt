1
00:01:24,122 --> 00:01:26,147
That won't do

2
00:01:26,357 --> 00:01:28,518
You need to warm up

3
00:01:32,764 --> 00:01:35,426
What's going on, Ms. JUNG Soon-jung.
I couldn't reach you

4
00:01:35,633 --> 00:01:37,157
That's not nice

5
00:01:43,207 --> 00:01:44,674
Long time no see

6
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:22,069
The suspect has
killed five people

7
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,074
The modus operandi is
extremely violent

8
00:02:25,316 --> 00:02:28,444
and she uses the
most unusual weapons

9
00:02:28,686 --> 00:02:34,522
Cosmetic plaster,
(a) plastic bag, duct tape

10
00:02:34,826 --> 00:02:39,662
And she even used scissors

11
00:02:39,697 --> 00:02:43,428
- She uses them in the oddest ways.
- What is her motive?

12
00:02:43,835 --> 00:02:47,438
Her 6-year-old daughter was

13
00:02:47,473 --> 00:02:50,039
kidnapped by a lunatic

14
00:02:50,074 --> 00:02:53,168
She was deserted after
being raped and killed

15
00:02:53,378 --> 00:02:55,539
That must have ticked her off

16
00:02:55,813 --> 00:02:58,077
But her killer was caught

17
00:02:58,316 --> 00:03:02,480
What does she have
against those 5 people?

18
00:03:02,854 --> 00:03:09,282
I don't know that yet

19
00:03:09,494 --> 00:03:11,052
I'm sorry

20
00:03:11,295 --> 00:03:14,397
You must find out so that

21
00:03:14,432 --> 00:03:16,457
we can prevent the next murder

22
00:03:18,302 --> 00:03:20,133
I'm sorry

23
00:03:20,905 --> 00:03:23,965
Her ex-husband, who was that?

24
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:27,909
Yeah, Detective Oh.
Where is he now?

25
00:03:33,951 --> 00:03:39,890
Sir, I thought you quit your job

26
00:03:40,124 --> 00:03:41,648
Why are you here?

27
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:47,056
I'm here to look into every
lead I can track down

28
00:03:47,398 --> 00:03:48,956
Why are you here?

29
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,327
I thought you knew everything
about that case

30
00:03:54,372 --> 00:03:57,933
Shit. Why does it seem like
someone else's story?

31
00:04:00,378 --> 00:04:01,572
Let me take a look

32
00:04:05,183 --> 00:04:09,449
The victims do not surface on
any of the official records

33
00:04:10,722 --> 00:04:13,122
I don't know who else is left

34
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,784
Nothing

35
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:26,231
<i>Defendant's attorney,
KIM Woo-taek</i>

36
00:04:31,175 --> 00:04:32,335
Good luck!

37
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,337
Where are you going?

38
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:36,806
The chief wants me
to bring you in.

39
00:04:37,415 --> 00:04:39,007
Are you going to arrest me?

40
00:04:45,423 --> 00:04:48,256
You must be busy,
having your phone turned off

41
00:04:49,761 --> 00:04:52,525
If you want to meet me,
you must look for me

42
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,658
I'm sure you can find me
if you put your mind to it

43
00:04:57,068 --> 00:05:00,526
Hurry up. I'll be waiting

44
00:05:48,186 --> 00:05:49,813
This was just practice

45
00:05:52,223 --> 00:05:55,249
I heard you sold your Porsche.
It looked like a new car

46
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,755
It's not like I'm in my 20's

47
00:05:57,995 --> 00:06:00,395
I don't want to be in the
public eye anymore

48
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:04,097
Why do you think
I still drive a BMW?

49
00:06:08,005 --> 00:06:10,241
What happened to the person
that you told me to defend?

50
00:06:10,276 --> 00:06:11,439
Indicted?

51
00:06:11,474 --> 00:06:12,602
Not yet

52
00:06:13,678 --> 00:06:17,444
- What do you mean not yet?
- It's not over yet.

53
00:06:17,682 --> 00:06:19,013
What isn't over?

54
00:06:20,184 --> 00:06:22,118
The crime

55
00:06:22,286 --> 00:06:23,776
What crime?

56
00:06:24,555 --> 00:06:25,715
Murder

57
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,815
Murder?

58
00:06:30,995 --> 00:06:32,860
Murder...

59
00:06:34,398 --> 00:06:38,630
You know, the thing is...
There's no such thing as crime

60
00:06:40,738 --> 00:06:44,299
It's a matter of whether you can
be protected by the law or not

61
00:06:46,677 --> 00:06:49,544
Murder, burglary, rape...

62
00:06:50,414 --> 00:06:52,473
It happens every day since the
beginning of human history

63
00:06:53,017 --> 00:06:56,976
When we call it a crime,
it becomes one

64
00:06:57,255 --> 00:06:59,348
And it's just as easy
to turn it over

65
00:06:59,991 --> 00:07:03,119
What we call law is
something very funny

66
00:07:08,299 --> 00:07:10,134
<i>Thank you for calling Kim
and Park Law Firm</i>

67
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:12,568
Let me talk to
Attorney KIM Wu-taek

68
00:07:14,238 --> 00:07:16,140
Can you give me
his cell number?

69
00:07:16,175 --> 00:07:18,026
<i>I'm sorry. I can't give out</i>

70
00:07:18,061 --> 00:07:19,842
<i>his number to anyone</i>

71
00:07:19,877 --> 00:07:22,914
I'm Detective OH of
Kangnam Police Department

72
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:24,013
It's an emergency

73
00:07:24,048 --> 00:07:25,514
<i>Please, call back tomorrow</i>

74
00:07:25,549 --> 00:07:27,744
I told you it's
an emergency bitch

75
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,550
Huh?

76
00:07:39,196 --> 00:07:42,222
Hello. This is Mr.
KIM's phone.

77
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,935
He's unable to come
to the phone now

78
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,495
<i>Who is this answering?</i>

79
00:07:47,104 --> 00:07:49,607
It's me. Don't you
recognize my voice?

80
00:07:49,642 --> 00:07:51,741
<i>What are you doing there?</i>

81
00:07:51,776 --> 00:07:56,379
Me? I'm having a date with Mr. KIM

82
00:07:56,414 --> 00:07:58,814
<i>Where are you?
No, you won't dare do it</i>

83
00:08:00,985 --> 00:08:02,680
Guess where I'm at right now

84
00:08:33,884 --> 00:08:37,684
Do you know why I like you (so)?

85
00:08:39,457 --> 00:08:42,119
You never try to use
your body to seduce me

86
00:08:42,593 --> 00:08:44,083
That's cool

87
00:08:56,941 --> 00:08:58,238
You carrying a lot of money?

88
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:00,602
No, it's my phone...

89
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,061
Now for the real action!

90
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,367
Okay?

91
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,498
Okay...

92
00:10:12,216 --> 00:10:13,740
Bitch!

93
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,149
You're totally crazy

94
00:10:20,257 --> 00:10:23,693
You crazy bitch.
Who the hell are you?

95
00:10:24,061 --> 00:10:25,551
What the...

96
00:10:30,968 --> 00:10:32,701
Mister!

97
00:10:32,736 --> 00:10:35,804
I want to go home

98
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,873
My mom's waiting

99
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,039
Crazy bitch

100
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,700
The suspect,

101
00:12:11,735 --> 00:12:14,136
I mean your ex-wife's
number has appeared

102
00:12:14,171 --> 00:12:16,298
You were right.
KIM Wu-taek is the next target.

103
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,699
I'm on my way

104
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,137
Both of their phones
have been turned off

105
00:12:56,847 --> 00:12:58,075
No one's answering?

106
00:12:58,315 --> 00:13:00,045
I just got through on his phone

107
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,776
- I'm sure he's there.
- Hello.

108
00:13:03,954 --> 00:13:05,148
<i>Ninth floor.</i>

109
00:13:06,757 --> 00:13:08,224
Hurry up!

110
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,490
Take the next one

111
00:13:10,628 --> 00:13:14,155
- Why?
- I'm busy. Sorry.

112
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,599
<i>Door closing</i>

113
00:13:30,381 --> 00:13:32,144
Let's go up together.
You said the car's here

114
00:14:17,695 --> 00:14:21,358
I'll be there in a second.
One minute?

115
00:14:29,206 --> 00:14:30,798
So many of them

116
00:14:37,514 --> 00:14:38,503
Sir

117
00:14:39,883 --> 00:14:41,568
What happened?
Did she get away?

118
00:14:41,603 --> 00:14:43,253
I'm sorry.
I barely missed her

119
00:14:43,288 --> 00:14:45,585
It's a total mess

120
00:14:48,492 --> 00:14:49,792
Where are you now?

121
00:14:49,827 --> 00:14:54,730
<i>I'm in my car.
Don't you ask me where I'm going?</i>

122
00:14:55,332 --> 00:14:56,731
Where are you headed?

123
00:14:57,067 --> 00:14:59,968
? Well, where shall I go?

124
00:15:00,971 --> 00:15:02,495
Try to guess

125
00:15:02,773 --> 00:15:04,308
Ask her if the victim

126
00:15:04,343 --> 00:15:06,242
is still alive

127
00:15:06,477 --> 00:15:09,246
What happened to the lawyer?
Is he still alive?

128
00:15:09,281 --> 00:15:11,214
He's alive

129
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:14,813
Guess why I let him live

130
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,120
It's been too easy so far.

131
00:15:18,422 --> 00:15:20,481
It's been quite a bore

132
00:15:21,592 --> 00:15:24,293
So, I want to give him a chance

133
00:15:24,328 --> 00:15:27,593
and make a decision later.
Whether to let him live or die.

134
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:32,601
So you'll have to find me soon

135
00:15:33,637 --> 00:15:35,935
<i>How can we be sure he's alive?</i>

136
00:15:36,206 --> 00:15:37,571
<i>Can we talk to him?</i>

137
00:15:39,343 --> 00:15:40,640
Of course

138
00:15:42,746 --> 00:15:44,873
Here, talk

139
00:15:47,017 --> 00:15:48,143
<i>Hello?</i>

140
00:15:49,486 --> 00:15:51,303
<i>This is the police</i>

141
00:15:51,338 --> 00:15:53,121
Save me. I'm at...

142
00:15:56,026 --> 00:15:59,189
<i>Hello? Where are you?</i>

143
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:02,795
Use your head. Or try praying

144
00:16:11,108 --> 00:16:14,322
<i>A stolen BMW.
License number 01 Jo 6743.</i>

145
00:16:14,357 --> 00:16:17,537
<i>A murder suspect has kidnapped a victim</i>

146
00:16:17,881 --> 00:16:20,717
<i>They fled
"Top Palace" around 21:14</i>

147
00:16:20,752 --> 00:16:22,514
<i>The suspect is 33 years old</i>

148
00:16:22,953 --> 00:16:24,888
The woman's name is
JUNG Soon-jung

149
00:16:24,923 --> 00:16:25,988
<i>Appearance?</i>

150
00:16:26,023 --> 00:16:28,082
Her appearance...

151
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:38,290
- She's 160 centimeters in height.
- 160 centimeters in height.

152
00:16:39,303 --> 00:16:42,204
. - Big eyes.
- Big eyes...

153
00:16:44,174 --> 00:16:46,233
And she looks kind

154
00:16:46,477 --> 00:16:47,842
<i>and?</i>

155
00:16:54,251 --> 00:16:58,312
Do you think the Jung Soon-jung
you know is the real JUNG Soon-jung?

156
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,715
Don't you remember
me from somewhere?

157
00:17:03,894 --> 00:17:06,988
Of course you don't remember

158
00:17:08,499 --> 00:17:13,527
Do you remember who OH Min-ah is?

159
00:17:18,275 --> 00:17:21,676
I'm giving you a chance to live.

160
00:17:22,379 --> 00:17:24,108
You won't get a second chance

161
00:17:24,448 --> 00:17:28,441
If you don't remember Min-ah,
you must die.

162
00:17:28,752 --> 00:17:31,118
You have a good memory

163
00:17:31,822 --> 00:17:35,383
That's how you became a lawyer

164
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:43,061
I know how dad feels now

165
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:49,432
When he said that life is lonely

166
00:17:51,241 --> 00:18:04,587
I heard his sad voice as
he whispered in my sleep

167
00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:14,164
Look at that. Look at that.

168
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:15,995
I can't get it off

169
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,835
I told you not to do it

170
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,537
You're tickling me

171
00:18:21,572 --> 00:18:24,508
Are you ticklish? Here?

172
00:18:24,543 --> 00:18:26,237
Where?

173
00:18:28,145 --> 00:18:31,205
I'm going to punish you for
not listening to me

174
00:18:31,481 --> 00:18:32,781
Start singing

175
00:18:32,816 --> 00:18:39,244
I know how dad feels now

176
00:18:39,556 --> 00:18:45,654
When he said that
life is lonely

177
00:19:06,016 --> 00:19:07,313
What is it?

178
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,360
I know who OH Min-ah
is A year ago,

179
00:19:16,395 --> 00:19:18,193
the HONG Gi-beom case

180
00:19:18,228 --> 00:19:20,597
A six-year-old girl was
kidnapped and raped

181
00:19:20,632 --> 00:19:22,564
She was killed and abandoned

182
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:24,497
She's OH Min-ah, isn't she?

183
00:19:46,023 --> 00:19:49,186
Took you long enough, bastard

184
00:20:01,338 --> 00:20:04,171
Do you know what the
dead leave behind?

185
00:20:07,611 --> 00:20:09,841
Nothing, really

186
00:20:11,114 --> 00:20:14,851
The dead are remembered
by those alive

187
00:20:14,886 --> 00:20:18,446
Memories are all you have

188
00:20:20,157 --> 00:20:21,624
But

189
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,728
how many people
do you think will

190
00:20:24,763 --> 00:20:27,060
remember a six-year-old girl?

191
00:20:28,765 --> 00:20:30,392
Not many

192
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:35,231
But you of all people should
have remembered her

193
00:20:35,472 --> 00:20:36,573
You accepted bribes
from the criminal(s)

194
00:20:36,608 --> 00:20:39,059
Who did terrible
things to my girl

195
00:20:39,094 --> 00:20:41,511
And you let him off
by pleading that

196
00:20:41,546 --> 00:20:43,278
he was mentally ill

197
00:20:43,313 --> 00:20:46,983
You let him have it easy at
the mental institution

198
00:20:47,018 --> 00:20:48,951
instead of prison

199
00:20:49,152 --> 00:20:52,522
You should have remembered her name
when you eat and when you sleep

200
00:20:52,557 --> 00:20:54,758
and everytime you take a breath!

201
00:20:54,793 --> 00:20:56,783
How could you forget?

202
00:21:05,135 --> 00:21:11,540
But a promise is a promise, right?

203
00:21:13,376 --> 00:21:17,073
Congratulations.
You passed the first test.

204
00:21:19,282 --> 00:21:21,250
But the second one awaits

205
00:21:28,925 --> 00:21:30,119
How are you sir?

206
00:21:30,794 --> 00:21:33,024
Do you have a hunch?

207
00:21:34,331 --> 00:21:35,889
Actually,

208
00:21:38,201 --> 00:21:40,931
today's is my little
girl's birthday

209
00:21:41,404 --> 00:21:43,838
It's also the day she died

210
00:21:44,207 --> 00:21:46,539
She died on her birthday...

211
00:21:47,778 --> 00:21:49,245
Where is her grave?

212
00:21:49,446 --> 00:21:51,576
Don't people usually
go to the cemetery?

213
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:53,707
- We cremated her.
- Wait. Wait. Wait.

214
00:21:54,084 --> 00:21:57,214
A hostage? Where?

215
00:21:57,249 --> 00:22:00,345
Okay, wait (for me)

216
00:22:00,824 --> 00:22:04,126
A woman claiming to be Soon-jung
called up the TV station

217
00:22:04,161 --> 00:22:07,264
telling them she was holding a hostage
at the sanitary landfill center

218
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:08,993
The landfill center

219
00:22:09,432 --> 00:22:11,195
That's where our girl was found

220
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:13,637
That's it. Let's go
Move it guys

221
00:22:13,672 --> 00:22:15,002
Move it, move it!

222
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:40,657
Princess Aurora was
her nickname

223
00:22:41,031 --> 00:22:43,591
She used to love that cartoon

224
00:22:48,171 --> 00:22:50,230
The day she disappeared,

225
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,874
Soon-jung called me

226
00:22:59,082 --> 00:23:02,518
We were divorced.
But since I was her father.

227
00:23:05,388 --> 00:23:09,552
And a policeman,
she thought I'd take care of it

228
00:23:14,564 --> 00:23:16,691
But I was no help at all

229
00:23:23,673 --> 00:23:26,233
I told her to make a
police report

230
00:23:27,811 --> 00:23:29,904
I was too busy to help out

231
00:23:30,847 --> 00:23:32,814
Stop it would you?

232
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:36,285
You'll get ill if you
keep recalling the past

233
00:23:36,753 --> 00:23:40,120
Look at that crowd out there...

234
00:23:40,323 --> 00:23:43,656
But why would the suspect,

235
00:23:45,028 --> 00:23:47,223
I mean your ex-wife...

236
00:23:49,866 --> 00:23:53,393
Why would she call
the TV station?

237
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:31,675
<i>I heard his sad voice as he
whispered in my sleep.</i>

238
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:34,075
- What is that?
- Get rid of the cameras.

239
00:24:35,078 --> 00:24:37,047
- Shit, off with the cameras
- Shit, be quiet!

240
00:24:37,082 --> 00:24:38,313
<i>Hello</i>

241
00:24:38,348 --> 00:24:41,950
<i>I'm Princess Aurora</i>

242
00:24:41,985 --> 00:24:45,079
<i>Thank you for coming here</i>

243
00:24:45,789 --> 00:24:48,383
<i>Today is my birthday.</i>

244
00:24:50,727 --> 00:24:56,563
<i>But no one is coming to see me</i>

245
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:01,565
<i>This is a lonely place</i>

246
00:25:02,505 --> 00:25:06,376
<i>It's quite lonely here</i>

247
00:25:06,411 --> 00:25:08,844
Where is she?

248
00:25:09,112 --> 00:25:09,713
I think it's coming from
the crane operating room

249
00:25:09,748 --> 00:25:12,011
<i>That's why I'm having
a birthday party</i>

250
00:25:12,382 --> 00:25:15,510
That's why I invited the police.

251
00:25:15,785 --> 00:25:18,447
My daddy is also a policeman.

252
00:25:18,688 --> 00:25:20,155
I'm sure my daddy is here too.

253
00:25:20,323 --> 00:25:22,557
Daddy!

254
00:25:22,592 --> 00:25:26,528
Daddy, where are you?

255
00:25:27,731 --> 00:25:29,464
- Is that your wife?
- Yes.

256
00:25:29,499 --> 00:25:32,696
<i>- I'm here, daddy.
- Shall we go and arrest her?</i>

257
00:25:34,437 --> 00:25:35,699
Shit

258
00:25:35,972 --> 00:25:38,202
<i>Teams 1 and 2, move to the
back of the crane</i>

259
00:25:38,575 --> 00:25:40,744
<i>Team 3, position under the crane
to go after the hostage</i>

260
00:25:40,779 --> 00:25:42,439
<i>He's not here...</i>

261
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,912
The camera's good

262
00:25:46,349 --> 00:25:48,010
The lighting's great.
Let's not make it a show.

263
00:25:48,318 --> 00:25:50,616
Should use your discretion
when you're filming

264
00:25:51,087 --> 00:25:54,386
Do you even know why
she's doing this? Shit!

265
00:25:54,724 --> 00:25:56,954
Do you know what
she's going through?

266
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:16,073
It's me. Do you see me?

267
00:26:17,747 --> 00:26:19,681
Let's talk

268
00:26:21,951 --> 00:26:24,579
I'm going to go over there.

269
00:26:24,921 --> 00:26:26,912
Talk to me

270
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,483
I don't want to talk to you

271
00:26:29,793 --> 00:26:34,287
Oh Sung-ho, what gives you
the right to talk to me?

272
00:26:34,831 --> 00:26:36,662
Because you're her father?

273
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:40,097
You don't have a rightto
claim to be her father

274
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:41,871
You're a cop,
but you couldn't even

275
00:26:41,906 --> 00:26:44,601
protect your own daughter

276
00:26:45,575 --> 00:26:51,104
Did you know that it's
Min-ah's birthday today?

277
00:26:51,948 --> 00:26:54,473
But in this very spot,

278
00:26:54,717 --> 00:26:57,948
my daughter was killed
and was found dead

279
00:26:58,755 --> 00:27:00,882
(She was) naked!

280
00:27:03,093 --> 00:27:05,027
A six-year-old girl

281
00:27:05,361 --> 00:27:07,795
My little angel

282
00:27:08,098 --> 00:27:11,034
She was killed by an animal
and left here to die

283
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:13,264
In the middle of
all this waste

284
00:27:14,637 --> 00:27:16,806
My girl was left to die
in this place where

285
00:27:16,841 --> 00:27:20,537
all the waste in Seoul lies

286
00:27:20,877 --> 00:27:25,314
And where is that
son of a bitch now?

287
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,985
He's being treated in a hospital

288
00:27:31,521 --> 00:27:33,455
What were you doing?

289
00:27:33,723 --> 00:27:37,124
You didn't even know it was
Min-ah's birthday that day

290
00:27:38,528 --> 00:27:41,326
I'll be going over there.

291
00:27:41,564 --> 00:27:43,465
Let's talk face to face

292
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,630
No, dad! Don't come here, dad

293
00:28:03,052 --> 00:28:06,681
Ms. JUNG Soon-jung,
can you hear me?

294
00:28:06,956 --> 00:28:09,858
This is the Chief Officer,
BYUN Sang-ho.

295
00:28:09,893 --> 00:28:16,389
Mister, my mom doesn't
want to talk to you now

296
00:28:16,699 --> 00:28:20,396
She must be really mad (now)

297
00:28:20,637 --> 00:28:23,197
My mom gets really scary
when she's mad

298
00:28:23,439 --> 00:28:26,441
What is this? I can't talk to
her like this

299
00:28:26,476 --> 00:28:28,611
Keep talking to her so that
we can launch the operation

300
00:28:28,646 --> 00:28:30,545
Try to divert her attention

301
00:28:31,047 --> 00:28:32,878
<i>Make sure you move carefully
so she doesn't notice</i>

302
00:28:33,783 --> 00:28:35,512
In any case, Soon-jung,

303
00:28:35,752 --> 00:28:38,221
please release the hostage

304
00:28:38,256 --> 00:28:40,712
- No.
- Why not?

305
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,686
That lawyer is a bad person

306
00:28:43,893 --> 00:28:46,521
Princess Aurora will punish him

307
00:28:48,198 --> 00:28:49,893
What was your daughter's name?

308
00:28:50,133 --> 00:28:52,863
Min-ah. OH Min-ah

309
00:28:57,774 --> 00:28:59,765
You're a good girl, Min-ah.
Aren't you?

310
00:29:00,043 --> 00:29:03,604
Min-ah's a good girl. Right?

311
00:29:08,518 --> 00:29:14,218
Daddy, I'm scared

312
00:29:15,191 --> 00:29:17,625
Daddy, I'm so scared

313
00:29:18,861 --> 00:29:22,262
Don't cry, Min-ah. Don't cry

314
00:29:25,735 --> 00:29:27,396
I'm sorry

315
00:29:28,771 --> 00:29:32,070
I really wanted to see you

316
00:29:32,175 --> 00:29:33,742
<i>Make sure to get the suspect</i>

317
00:29:33,777 --> 00:29:35,309
<i>completely immobilized</i>

318
00:29:37,213 --> 00:29:40,444
I'm so scared, daddy

319
00:29:43,052 --> 00:29:46,544
It's okay. It's going to be okay

320
00:29:47,123 --> 00:29:54,495
Daddy is sorry to
Min-ah and Mommy...

321
00:29:55,832 --> 00:30:02,067
Don't cry Daddy.
If you cry, it will make me feel sad.

322
00:30:04,407 --> 00:30:07,376
Mommy will be sad, too.

323
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:13,806
It's okay. It's okay.
Don't worry.

324
00:30:15,618 --> 00:30:18,451
<i>Be sure to act calm,
to prepare for the worst</i>

325
00:30:21,124 --> 00:30:22,887
Min-ah

326
00:30:25,628 --> 00:30:28,563
I love you. I love you

327
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,028
Cleared to go

328
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:35,200
Daddy

329
00:30:37,473 --> 00:30:39,207
Daddy, I don't want to go

330
00:30:39,242 --> 00:30:42,234
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy,
I don't want to go

331
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,411
look this way

332
00:31:35,446 --> 00:31:36,492
I'm Sorry

333
00:32:14,137 --> 00:32:17,106
- Mom.
- Be careful. Don't run

334
00:32:18,908 --> 00:32:21,604
Did you have fun?

335
00:32:22,545 --> 00:32:25,446
What did you learn today,
Princess Aurora?

336
00:32:25,715 --> 00:32:29,981
Look here.
Make it disappear. Poof!

337
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:35,018
Did you make me disappear?

338
00:32:35,591 --> 00:32:38,661
Min-ah. This is your present.
Happy birthday.

339
00:32:38,696 --> 00:32:39,193
Thank you

340
00:32:39,228 --> 00:32:42,131
What are you doing?
Hurry up. Run!

341
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:43,621
Bye

342
00:32:43,966 --> 00:32:46,536
You're always making me late.
Get on, quick.

343
00:32:46,571 --> 00:32:50,273
- You must feel great
- Mom,

344
00:32:50,308 --> 00:32:53,299
I feel sorry for Do-yeon

345
00:32:53,643 --> 00:32:55,167
Why do you say that?

346
00:32:55,445 --> 00:32:59,647
She's her step-mom

347
00:32:59,682 --> 00:33:02,652
When her father's not around,
she always hit Do-yeon

348
00:33:02,687 --> 00:33:05,822
That's why she prays
every night

349
00:33:05,857 --> 00:33:08,313
That her step-mom would die

350
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,620
Min-ah, your birthday is coming up.
What shall we do?

351
00:33:13,863 --> 00:33:18,468
- Let's see what this is.
- Wow, it's my favorite

352
00:33:18,503 --> 00:33:21,869
You must be so happy.
Will you give me one?

353
00:33:33,816 --> 00:33:36,284
I'm on my way Min-ah.
Wait for me.

354
00:33:36,886 --> 00:33:37,978
Oh

355
00:33:40,756 --> 00:33:42,757
Oh, shit.

356
00:33:42,792 --> 00:33:45,027
Look where you going,
will you?

357
00:33:45,062 --> 00:33:46,756
Oh, you little bitch

358
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:49,263
Why didn't you stay home
if your kid is waiting?

359
00:33:49,298 --> 00:33:52,435
Why did you have to take your
car out and bump into mine?

360
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,186
This is a one-way street

361
00:33:54,221 --> 00:33:55,903
You look like a real fox

362
00:33:56,138 --> 00:33:59,674
Hit me if you want.
Take a punch.

363
00:33:59,709 --> 00:34:04,614
- Oh, Shin-ok. I got into an accident.
- You're really funny, you know that?

364
00:34:04,649 --> 00:34:06,015
- No, I'm almost there.
- Let's hurry up and settle.

365
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,312
I'm nearby

366
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:09,884
Man, she got into an accident.

367
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:11,854
I told you we shouldn't
hire someone with a kid!

368
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:14,541
I have a reservation
at the spa. Oh, no!

369
00:34:14,576 --> 00:34:17,193
- You can just go.
- What about the shop?

370
00:34:17,228 --> 00:34:18,683
You can just lock up.

371
00:34:18,895 --> 00:34:20,920
No one's going to take the girl

372
00:34:21,264 --> 00:34:23,289
Yes, I can just lock up, right?

373
00:34:23,499 --> 00:34:25,433
Hey, what do you want to do?

374
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:28,197
Come on out

375
00:34:29,338 --> 00:34:32,171
Shouldn't divorce when
you have a kid!

376
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,905
Hey, have a piece of gum

377
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:40,630
Mister, I'm short of
the taxi fare

378
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:44,167
I can't believe you're
trying to hitch a ride

379
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,139
Damn it!

380
00:37:22,978 --> 00:37:24,775
Mommy...

381
00:37:45,634 --> 00:37:47,226
Hey kid

382
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:51,165
What are you doing here?
Do you want a ride?

383
00:37:56,479 --> 00:37:59,209
No, Min-ah!

384
00:38:01,517 --> 00:38:07,012
Don't Min-ah! No, no, no!

385
00:38:09,024 --> 00:38:13,222
- No, Min-ah. No! No, Min-ah!
- Relax. Just relax
