2
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:30,420
Welcome.

3
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,519
Have a great time shopping.

4
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:21,573
Okay.

5
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:24,042
Let's meet up later then.
Alright. Okay.

6
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:46,197
Why are you so restless?

7
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:49,668
Do you have to make me
look for you all over?

8
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,498
Why aren't you answering me?
Are you deaf?

9
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:56,708
I'm sorry, lady

10
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,804
What did you call me? Lady?

11
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,208
You just don't listen.
Come here.

12
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:05,212
I told you to come here

13
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:06,612
Come here.

14
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,117
Come here now.

15
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:16,057
Say it to me once more.
What did you call me?

16
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:18,864
Answer me!

17
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,630
Are you making fun of me?
Making fun of an adult?

18
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:28,200
Oh, you're hurting me!
I'm sorry

19
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,640
Mom~ mom~

20
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,119
Will you do this again?
Or won't you?

21
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:42,110
I won't do it again

22
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,188
Go and wash your face.
Stop crying by the time I count to 3

23
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,794
One, two...

24
00:03:57,136 --> 00:04:03,041
Oh, hi honey.
I'm at the department store

25
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,675
I have nothing much to do
without you!

26
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:10,312
You know I relieve stress
through shopping.

27
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,575
So you're coming home
tomorrow morning?

28
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:16,312
What do you want for breakfast?
Did you buy me a present?

29
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,958
A handbag?

30
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,367
Get a grip.

31
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:33,668
How else do you think I survive
raising someone else's kid?

32
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,604
You're always saying that money
is everything to me

33
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:41,779
Once poverty comes through the door,
love is gone out the window

34
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,818
Don't forget what I'm
telling you now. Bye...

35
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:52,915
Oh!

36
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:38,670
<i>Princess Aurora</i>

37
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,500
What's he doing?

38
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,168
- Can you turn off the siren?
- What?

39
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,577
- Turn off the siren, please.
- What?

40
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:22,479
- Turn off the siren.
- Oh, we're actually...

41
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:25,377
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?

42
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:26,950
Turn it off

43
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,954
<i>- You're always doing what you're told
- Welcome/</i>

44
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,790
Please turn on your lights

45
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:42,166
- We're the police.
- Yes?

46
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:47,867
- We're here to investigate the crime scene.
- Yes, so what?

47
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,268
Have a great time shopping!

48
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,907
Screw the shopping

49
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:58,163
Do they expect police to
pay for parking?

50
00:06:58,198 --> 00:07:01,579
Don't get angry.
Here, we need validation

51
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:04,888
Oh, geez

52
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,022
Look inside

53
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,923
Keep up the good work

54
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,095
Oh, shit!

55
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:21,164
I pray to you Lord,

56
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:27,108
to help guide those poor in need

57
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,938
- Amen!
- Amen

58
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,318
I think the body was
stabbed dozens of times

59
00:07:32,353 --> 00:07:34,252
With a sharp object
like a spear

60
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:37,920
It doesn't seem like an accident.
More like revenge

61
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:41,160
- Where can you buy kitchenware?
- Kitchenware?

62
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,022
A fork has three spears,
right?

63
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,697
You've been peeking
during your prayer

64
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:53,833
Such a sensual body and
smooth skin

65
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,567
This is the best car for those
with a pride to match

66
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:01,113
A beautiful and sexy wife
who listens to you

67
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,479
Wouldn't that be fantastic?

68
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,750
I prefer a lover than a wife

69
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,980
She can be both a wife
and a lover

70
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,154
She'd be attracting attention.

71
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,521
But you'll be the
only one she wants

72
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:18,330
Scientific and initial
investigation are

73
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,365
key to every case.

74
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,935
You need to explore all the
options you have

75
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,770
Explore all the options!

76
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:29,104
- You must use your head!
- Use your head

77
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:36,640
Are you laughing? How can you
laugh at a time like this?

78
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,886
Anyway, try to
organize the facts

79
00:08:39,921 --> 00:08:41,717
in a scientific way!

80
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:46,189
Yes, Sir. We don't have the
murder weapon yet

81
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,739
There's a high chance that
a kitchen utensil was used

82
00:08:48,774 --> 00:08:51,054
So I've requested the forensic
lab to investigate them

83
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,599
We're looking the crime as both
incidental or calculated revenge

84
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:54,967
Keeping both options open,
we're investigating

85
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:57,303
possible suspects
around the victim.

86
00:08:57,338 --> 00:08:58,736
What else?

87
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,141
We've come to a conclusion that...
the murderer is female

88
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,402
- A woman!
- Yes

89
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:09,225
How did you find that out?

90
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,839
That's great work.
Well done!

91
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:14,544
In any case,

92
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,082
you are fools if you can't
figure this one out.

93
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:20,660
I'm sure the criminal's face was
caught on the security cameras

94
00:09:20,695 --> 00:09:23,527
Narrow them down, one by one.

95
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,365
Get to it! Move it! Come on!

96
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:35,964
What are you doing, pastor?
Praying again?

97
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:41,078
Ms. JUNG Soon-jung,

98
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,281
did you pack your own lunch again?

99
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:43,047
Yes.

100
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,140
Oh, Ms. JUNG

101
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,011
I heard you've got your license
for heavy machinery

102
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,821
Guess you'll be selling
trucks too?

103
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:50,721
My dream is to drive a crane

104
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:54,886
- You get better commission.
- That's scary.

105
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,158
- You look great today.
- Thanks.

106
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:13,543
Cameras for each shop.
40 shops in all.

107
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,474
One in each aisle & corner

108
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:19,411
Shit, I'll never
go through this all

109
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:22,812
Did they teach you how to curse
at the Police Academy?

110
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,553
Well, Detective Oh,

111
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,826
Why do you want to
be a pastor?

112
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:36,062
What does a pastor do?
They guide sinners

113
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,303
Policemen do the same thing.

114
00:10:37,338 --> 00:10:38,569
We catch the sinners

115
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:41,198
- and put them in jail.
- Let's take a look.

116
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,701
Gotcha

117
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,443
That's her, isn't it?

118
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:52,846
But who's gonna talk to her?

119
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,459
What's that?

120
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,534
It's a magic wand

121
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:18,073
She's learning magic these days

122
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:21,980
Wow, the wand looks great.

123
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,350
Did your mom buy it for you?

124
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,683
Did your dad buy it?

125
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,624
On the day of the murder,

126
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:43,059
When you were at
the department store

127
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,671
with your mother
in the bathroom...

128
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:48,037
She's not my mother.

129
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:49,666
Oh, okay

130
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:54,175
Did she fight with anyone?

131
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,008
Did you see the face?

132
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,121
I want to put that
bad guy in jail

133
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:04,453
That lady is not a bad person!

134
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,351
What lady?

135
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,357
The lady.
You don't know a thing!

136
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,958
- How's my hair?
- The color came out great.

137
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,331
It looks great

138
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:23,972
I'm leaving now

139
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,303
Come this way

140
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,846
You've ordered dinner,
remember?

141
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:29,213
That was ages ago.

142
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,751
I'm not waiting for that

143
00:12:31,786 --> 00:12:33,309
Delivery is here.

144
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:40,292
Hey, I almost collapsed
waiting for you

145
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:42,361
We had back to back deliveries

146
00:12:42,396 --> 00:12:44,124
Well, too bad.

147
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:47,633
I'm no longer hungry.
Take it back

148
00:12:47,668 --> 00:12:49,294
Okay?

149
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,606
Ordering food and sending
it back again.

150
00:12:53,641 --> 00:12:56,674
Talk about being rude

151
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,708
What did you just say?

152
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:04,349
- I didn't say anything.
- Yes, you said something.

153
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,574
You're calling me rude?

154
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,520
How dare you call me that?

155
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:14,360
- Did you really say that?
- No. I didn't say that

156
00:13:14,395 --> 00:13:17,386
Be careful from now on.
Hurry on out

157
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:21,128
Where are you going?

158
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:25,161
Apologize before you leave

159
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,531
Hurry and apologize

160
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:40,050
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry

161
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:44,050
Don't order from that place
from now on. Got it?

162
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,932
You had me waiting
a long time

163
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:04,099
Is that all you have to
say to me?

164
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:07,036
Your hair! It looks nice

165
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,446
I'm going now.

166
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:13,315
Mr. Na, please come to
our shop

167
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,019
I'm going now

168
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:20,690
She sure works hard to
sell cars

169
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,224
Is she still single?

170
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:30,535
Why do you ask?
If you ever get caught!

171
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,292
Aren't you going home?

172
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,954
- Hmm...
- Anything interesting?

173
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:00,098
Nothing. My eyes are
killing me

174
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,392
Sir,

175
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,169
let's have some ribs
with soju

176
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:06,303
Forget it, you devil

177
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,465
How can you want to eat meat when
we have a murder case?

178
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,541
You need to eat to work hard

179
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,669
- I'll see you there.
- Okay, alright. Let's eat.

180
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,069
<i>Start singing/</i>

181
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:45,676
<i>I know how dad feels now</i>

182
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:52,014
<i>When he said that
life is lonely</i>

183
00:15:53,719 --> 00:16:05,824
<i>I heard his sad voice as
he whispered in my sleep</i>

184
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:14,899
<i>I know how dad feels now</i>

185
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:20,704
<i>When he said that
life is lonely</i>

186
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:27,375
<i>The song he used to sing as
he looked into the sky</i>

187
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,297
<i>Not yet, Min-ah.</i>

188
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:44,098
<i>I didn't light the candles. Wait</i>

189
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,739
<i>Hey, wait</i>

190
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,922
What's in the sampler?

191
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,089
It's a moisturizer

192
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,093
How does it work?

193
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:15,594
It calms your skin

194
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,170
You'll be getting
a facial later.

195
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:21,037
It'll help brighten your face

196
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:25,236
I really like the service here

197
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,853
We'll be giving you a
free hand massage today

198
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,686
Put your hands together

199
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,709
Didn't you hear something?

200
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,476
Hear what?

201
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:49,652
What is it?

202
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,452
Something's wrong

203
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:43,612
You put on your gown already.
Did you go to the bathroom?

204
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,152
Hold on

205
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,327
Hey, what's wrong with you?

206
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,995
I didn't do it

207
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,261
Oh, no. It's not me.
I didn't do it

208
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:23,088
I'm positive that I made holes

209
00:20:23,123 --> 00:20:25,122
so that she could breathe

210
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,659
Or else, she'd suffocate.
And we never plaster hands

211
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:30,195
That's right.
Why would we do her hands?

212
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,890
Then, why did you
leave her alone?

213
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,397
I was having a bite to eat

214
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:36,101
- How long?
- About 15 minutes

215
00:20:36,136 --> 00:20:39,388
Did you have any
other customers?

216
00:20:39,423 --> 00:20:42,641
I had a customer.
But, she was new

217
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:44,199
Do you remember her face?

218
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,979
Well, I think I'd recognize her
if I ever saw her again

219
00:20:47,014 --> 00:20:49,079
Hey, hey. Take them in,

220
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:52,216
they can be charged for negligence

221
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,286
Why are you doing this?
I did nothing wrong

222
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:56,272
Move out of the way.

223
00:20:56,307 --> 00:20:58,397
Come this way. Move out

224
00:20:58,432 --> 00:21:00,487
Come this way. This way

225
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,342
This is the victim's cell phone

226
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:51,866
Go on, take the call

227
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,614
<i>Did you have a nice facial?
Are you loosened up?</i>

228
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:57,967
<i>Why didn't you
answer your phone?</i>

229
00:21:58,002 --> 00:22:00,250
How do you know Ms. Choi Shin-ok?

230
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:03,288
<i>Hello? Who is this?
Why you answering this phone?</i>

231
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:05,455
I'm Detective JUNG of homicide

232
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,126
Ms. CHOl Shin-ok died
this afternoon

233
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:09,286
<i>What?</i>

234
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,486
Hello? Hello?

235
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,891
Shit, he hung up

236
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,267
<i>NA Jae-keun</i>

237
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:20,294
- She was having a facial
- I don't know!

238
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,800
Do you know this NA Jae-keun?

239
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:26,567
I don't know anything

240
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,804
He's Shin-ok's boyfriend

241
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:31,346
Boyfriend?

242
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,346
You're saying he's her
boyfriend, right?

243
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:36,419
I really don't know anything

244
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:40,192
This shop actually
belongs to Mr. NA

245
00:22:40,227 --> 00:22:42,726
He's the owner of

246
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:45,226
Chukbok Wedding Hall

247
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,988
Wedding hall?

248
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:51,670
- I really don't know anything else.
- Hey, let's go.

249
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:55,401
- I'm just a part-timer
- Okay. Thank you.

250
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:11,823
So the dead woman and my husband

251
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:15,227
knew each other?

252
00:23:15,262 --> 00:23:16,387
Yes.

253
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,119
So what?

254
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:21,064
Excuse me?

255
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,569
You're still single, right?

256
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,104
Yes

257
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,706
You'll find out when
you get married,

258
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:35,003
but being married is like that.
It's not perfect

259
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:39,548
Well, you know, lady...

260
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:43,255
Can you recall where
you were last

261
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,524
Friday between 11 to 12:30 am?

262
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:47,788
I was here in my office

263
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:52,961
Oh, honey. You have company

264
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:02,363
What are you doing here

265
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,666
instead of going after
the criminals?

266
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:08,107
This is an invasion of privacy

267
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,679
Please don't misunderstand.

268
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:12,342
This is all part of
the investigation

269
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,813
You can call it what you want

270
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,580
I even played golf with your
Commissioner last weekend

271
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:23,191
You shouldn't hassle me like this

272
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:24,521
Okay

273
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:26,256
You can leave now

274
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:33,304
I'll buy you dinner some time

275
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:36,406
I know you're working hard on this case

276
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:43,540
Much of the plaster ended up in
her airway and gullet

277
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:46,342
So the death was instant

278
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:50,053
And there was much struggle,

279
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:53,922
as there are evident marks on
her neck, shoulders, and stomach

280
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,195
And there are fingernail marks...

281
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,328
Fingernail marks!

282
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:00,363
That proves that
the killer is female

283
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:02,267
The last murder was committed
by a woman. And so was this one!

284
00:25:02,302 --> 00:25:03,668
Don't you feel the connection?

285
00:25:03,703 --> 00:25:05,687
What connection?

286
00:25:05,722 --> 00:25:07,671
Oh, you're too dull

287
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:10,198
Anyway, what did you
want us to see?

288
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:19,674
It's Princess Aurora

289
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,479
How's the ride?

290
00:25:36,514 --> 00:25:37,958
It feels good

291
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:50,207
I want to drive on forever...

292
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:53,246
Until we reach the Pacific Ocean

293
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:55,913
The Pacific Ocean?

294
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:59,257
I can't go that far

295
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,888
I really hate it here.
I really hate it

296
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:07,997
This place makes me sad.
It makes me unhappy

297
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,895
I want to get away
from this place

298
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:14,069
But, surely you must overcome that

299
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:17,274
You're right.
I need to do that

300
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:24,882
I wish I could go somewhere
and get drunk tonight

301
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:41,396
Are you okay?

302
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,533
We're at my palace right now

303
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:58,213
The palace of blessing
and happiness

304
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:08,056
We can understand each other

305
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,557
because we're alike

306
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:15,591
We share the same sorrow
and unhappiness

307
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:20,498
Our unhappy marriage
and sad lives

308
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:27,477
But we'll be happy one day.
Right?

309
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:41,074
Get with it.
You're ruining the mood

310
00:27:41,109 --> 00:27:43,759
You're right.
I should't do that

311
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,987
- What's this?
- It'll help you sober up.

312
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:05,109
? How do you feel?
Are you better now?

313
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:49,225
<i>I know how dad feels now</i>

314
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:54,061
<i>When he said that
life is lonely</i>

315
00:28:54,432 --> 00:29:00,572
<i>I heard his sad voice as he
whispered in my sleep</i>

316
00:29:00,607 --> 00:29:04,508
Did you say that we share
the same feelings?

317
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:09,836
We're totally different,
you son of a bitch

318
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:21,281
Listen to this before you die

319
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:25,753
Isn't her voice pretty?

320
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:31,532
This was my happiness

321
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:42,380
On the murder scene of both
CHOl Shin-ok and NA Jae-keun,

322
00:29:42,415 --> 00:29:46,407
the same sticker was
found on the bodies

323
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:49,649
The killer is exposing
her identity

324
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,540
It was hard to link these murders

325
00:29:52,575 --> 00:29:55,125
to the department store killing

326
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,425
But there was something that
we had overlooked

327
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,688
Look here

328
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:03,559
I was oblivious of this fact
during the initial investigation

329
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:06,436
I've come to the conclusion
that all 3 cases are

330
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,706
the acts of a single killer.
They all involve a child

331
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:10,105
That's all

332
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:17,213
What's the link between the

333
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:21,184
department store victim
and these ones?

334
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:25,913
For instance, did the two women
know each other?

335
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:30,321
We cannot find the link as of yet

336
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:35,030
Well, let's organize
a special team

337
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,734
to focus on this case

338
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,304
And please take extra precaution

339
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:41,372
when you talk to the press

340
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:42,430
Yes Sir

341
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:49,612
I'm on my way back.

342
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,638
Did the test driver return yet?

343
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:10,824
Are you still studying
to become a pastor?

344
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:14,266
Yeah

345
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:19,436
But I haven't gotten that
far because I've been busy

346
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:22,313
It's funny that you're trying
to help other people

347
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:24,165
when you have troubles
of your own when you

348
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,982
couldn't even take care of
your own family

349
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,018
Don't you think so?

350
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:31,979
You must pray a lot

351
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:37,551
Do you pray for Min-ah
and me from time to time?

352
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,988
Often

353
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:47,035
When you become a pastor,

354
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,268
will you be able to
save Min-ah's soul?

355
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:01,975
Why did you come here?
To pray for me?

356
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:13,220
We look like we're
committing adultery

357
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,591
People used to think I was your

358
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:18,094
mistress because of
our age difference

359
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:21,729
You should go now

360
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,160
Don't you need a ride?

361
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,698
I'll take a cab

362
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,138
Fine, then

363
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,964
Ah, wait

364
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:36,580
Have you been to a department
store lately?

365
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:41,146
Well? Did someone see me there?

366
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:46,750
- No, never mind
- What? You're making me feel bad.

367
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,657
At times,

368
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:54,258
I'm scared of you

369
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,244
Detective, don't get me wrong.

370
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:43,941
I've stopped doing
this long time ago

371
00:34:58,362 --> 00:34:59,629
Thanks. Here you go

372
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:02,333
- No way, I can't take this.
- Come on!

373
00:35:02,368 --> 00:35:03,664
Okay

374
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:05,327
You can leave

375
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:09,670
Yes, sir!

376
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:51,197
<i>Hanseung Barbecue</i>

377
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:05,180
Hey! Where have you been
all this time?

378
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:10,043
I was at my elementary
school reunion today

379
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:11,845
I didn't want to go

380
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:15,693
But Kwang-su forced me to go

381
00:38:15,728 --> 00:38:16,990
so I went

382
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:18,320
But...

383
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,031
So you were at your
elementary school reunion?

384
00:38:20,066 --> 00:38:21,464
Yes

385
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:24,702
And that's because Kwang-su
forced you to go?

386
00:38:24,737 --> 00:38:25,964
Yes.

387
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:31,003
Kwang-su was just
here for dinner

388
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:35,038
Oh, really?

389
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:40,148
When did he get here?
He should have called me first

390
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:44,587
Why do you always
go for my head?

391
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:46,886
Get ready to close up.
It's already three

392
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:49,556
Yes, mother

393
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:52,422
Excuse me.

394
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,761
We're done for the day

395
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:59,728
The beef here is too thick

396
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:03,339
Damn it. The scissors are
right there

397
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:13,211
It's all burnt!
Don't you like it?

398
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:17,483
It tastes fine

399
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:23,018
I can't eat it thinking
of my family

400
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,353
Are you from Yanbian?

401
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,128
Can you tell?

402
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:38,874
But we're closing now

403
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:41,167
You have to eat up

404
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,298
Mister

405
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,934
Oh, you surprised me.

406
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,637
I didn't even hear you coming

407
00:40:06,672 --> 00:40:07,870
Are you on your way out?

408
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:10,635
- Are you off somewhere?
- Yes.

409
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:14,979
I'm sorry.
Can you find another cab?

410
00:40:15,014 --> 00:40:16,469
Why?

411
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,746
Because, it's the first guest.

412
00:40:20,781 --> 00:40:24,244
Are you refusing a passenger?

413
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:28,954
Don't be so defensive

414
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:32,855
- What bad luck so early in the morning.
- Mister...

415
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:35,628
Are you in a hurry?

416
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:39,493
I asked you if you're in a hurry

417
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,835
Yes, I am

418
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:50,946
Play it

419
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:52,813
What?

420
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:56,617
Play it if you want to

421
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:08,365
<i>I know how dad feels now</i>

422
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,100
She's a great singer

423
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,103
<i>When he said that life is lonely</i>

424
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:14,900
Have a piece of gum

425
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:25,481
<i>I heard his sad voice as
he whispered in my sleep</i>

426
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:31,587
<i>I know how dad feels now</i>

427
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:35,558
<i>When he said that life is lonely</i>

428
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:41,398
<i>The song he used to sing as
he looked into the sky</i>

429
00:41:41,433 --> 00:41:45,528
<i>I saw his sad smile</i>

430
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,662
Mister, is it still
unlucky to pick up

431
00:41:54,697 --> 00:41:56,814
a female at the beginning
of the shift?

432
00:41:56,849 --> 00:42:01,615
It's all superstition

433
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:05,986
But I'm sure it's
based on something

434
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:08,354
I was in an accident a while ago

435
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:11,440
My first passenger
had been a woman

436
00:42:11,475 --> 00:42:14,289
And I knew that
something was weird

437
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:16,691
Did you feel weird today, too?

438
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:20,836
Mister, if...

439
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:26,041
If a six-year-old girl
asked you

440
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:29,810
for a ride,
would you allow that?

441
00:42:29,845 --> 00:42:33,310
Sure. Children are people, too

442
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,614
What if the girl didn't have
enough to pay for the fare?

443
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:46,821
If the kid was short
of just 2 dollars,

444
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:50,359
would you still take her home?

445
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:53,796
What are you saying?

446
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:57,096
If the child, the child...

447
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:03,681
Mister, I don't have enough money
for the taxi ride

448
00:43:03,716 --> 00:43:08,586
Would you still take me home?

449
00:43:08,621 --> 00:43:10,519
Huh, mister?

450
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:14,957
What is this? Get out!
Who the hell are you?

451
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:18,253
Get out! You must be crazy

452
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,330
Get out. Get out

453
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:25,734
Get out, you

454
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:51,248
The murderer is a real psycho

455
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:55,090
And what's with the
Princess Aurora stickers?

456
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:00,429
Yes, chief

457
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:04,433
In Misari?

458
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,734
Yeah...

459
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:10,103
Got it, sir

460
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,767
We have to go to Misari now

461
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:15,011
What for? It doesn't fall
under our jurisdiction

462
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:18,082
A taxi driver was murdered this morning

463
00:45:18,117 --> 00:45:19,349
- in a weird fashion.
- Let's go.

464
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:20,680
Okay

465
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:25,451
I didn't order barbecue.

466
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:28,124
I just ordered beef stew

467
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:31,861
It's on the house. Cheer up

468
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:34,722
Thank you

469
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:42,702
Why are you laughing

470
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:47,873
I think that Korea is full of
strange things

471
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:51,048
Why do you cut beef with scissors?

472
00:45:51,083 --> 00:45:53,448
Well, (that's) because...

473
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:56,448
it's convenient

474
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:06,230
Can you let me work here?

475
00:46:06,265 --> 00:46:08,596
I'll do anything

476
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:13,771
- I have no (other) place to go.
- A bottle of soju, please.

477
00:46:13,806 --> 00:46:17,274
A job? I can't decide
(on that) on my own

478
00:46:17,309 --> 00:46:19,139
My mother's in charge of that

479
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:29,383
- I'll be free in about 30 minutes.
- Hey!

480
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:32,790
What are you doing?
The customers want(s) some soju

481
00:46:32,825 --> 00:46:34,417
Okay, mom

482
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:07,313
- Oh, you're all wet.
- It's okay.

483
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,229
You're even sexier
when you're wet

484
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:18,826
Do you know what 'sexy' means?

485
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:24,101
I don't. What does it mean?

486
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:28,441
Something nice

487
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:46,455
Stay still

488
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,191
I said I'd give you a job

489
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,031
Oh, shit. I'm going crazy

490
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:03,238
<i>- Where are you?
- I'm going, mom.</i>

491
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:06,914
Stay put for a second

492
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:21,419
You like it?

493
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:29,439
Oh, shit. You're making me hot

494
00:48:29,474 --> 00:48:31,669
Me, too

495
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:37,604
Stay still

496
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:41,743
Close your eyes.
Keep them closed

497
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:46,319
Shit, today's my lucky day

498
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:12,343
What is this?

499
00:49:12,378 --> 00:49:13,605
Don't move

500
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,883
If you move an inch,
I'll cut this off

501
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:21,420
You know that these scissors
are very sharp, don't you?

502
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:25,796
- Don't move.
- You bitch!

503
00:49:25,831 --> 00:49:28,356
I told you not to move

504
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:38,068
Oh, why are you doing this?

505
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:40,800
Why am I doing this? Why?

506
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:44,011
I wonder why.
I really do wonder

507
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:47,748
These scissors are really handy

508
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:53,090
You have a dirty mouth.
Don't you want to curse now?

509
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:56,651
<i>- Hello?
- Do it, now!</i>

510
00:49:58,195 --> 00:49:59,928
Hey, you fucking asshole!

511
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:01,863
<i>- Who's this calling in the
- It's a woman.</i>

512
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:06,903
<i>- Middle of the night and cursing?
- Hey you stupid bitch.</i>

513
00:50:06,938 --> 00:50:09,606
<i>- It hurts like hell
- Is it you, Myeong-gil?</i>

514
00:50:09,641 --> 00:50:11,375
<i>Myeong-gil, Myeong-gil/</i>

515
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:12,967
Mom...

516
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:23,686
Maybe it's not here.
I don't see it

517
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:26,418
No, it should be here

518
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,214
I'm sure it's here somewhere

519
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:35,156
It's like looking for
a needle in a haystack

520
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,262
I'm sorry

521
00:50:48,011 --> 00:50:49,410
I found it!

522
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:54,418
Would have been nice if she
put it somewhere noticeable

523
00:50:54,453 --> 00:50:55,578
Give it to me

524
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:58,782
Where are you going?

525
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:15,929
<i>I heard his sad voice as he
whispered in my sleep</i>

526
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:21,641
<i>I know how dad feels now</i>

527
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:24,980
What is this?

528
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:27,650
It's a voice of a kid singing

529
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:32,213
Let's go

530
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:34,649
Are you finished sir?

531
00:51:39,062 --> 00:51:40,430
<i>The phone has been turned off</i>

532
00:51:40,465 --> 00:51:41,692
Sir!

533
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:51,506
<i>- Who do you keep calling?
- The phone has been turned off</i>

534
00:51:54,845 --> 00:52:00,477
How did you know where
to find the sticker?

535
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:02,782
Sir!

536
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,357
- Will you get off?
- Here?

537
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:15,622
I want be alone

538
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:23,261
Hey, CHOl

539
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:26,807
What?

540
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:31,212
What? Missing?

541
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:34,115
What? Which barbecue restaurant?

542
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:36,450
Barbecue restaurant... Hanseung?

543
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:37,813
Hanseung?

544
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:42,653
Got it

545
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:47,262
Shit

546
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:41,348
Oh, shit

547
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:09,412
I didn't keep still this time

548
00:54:09,447 --> 00:54:10,379
I told the director...

549
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:15,016
What is that?

550
00:54:15,051 --> 00:54:16,620
- Did you see that?
- Yes.

551
00:54:16,655 --> 00:54:17,882
What is it?

552
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:19,721
Looks like scissors

553
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,725
- What are you doing?
- It was scissors, right?

554
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,317
Oh my gosh

555
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,860
Ladies, help me

556
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,129
What's he doing?

557
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:30,496
What are you doing, mister?
Go away

558
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:59,594
You're on to something.
Aren't you?

559
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:04,558
Tell the chief to put out
a(n) notice for arrest

560
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,334
And get a trace on the cell phone

561
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:10,806
Who's the suspect?
Shit, I'm going crazy

562
00:55:11,174 --> 00:55:14,166

Just this once. Call me
