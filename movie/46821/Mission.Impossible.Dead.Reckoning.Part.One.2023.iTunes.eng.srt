1
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,503
Mission Report.

2
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:49,508
Russian Federation submarine
K599 Sevastopol.

3
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:51,927
Operation: Podkova.

4
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,720
Day 74.

5
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:58,600
The active learning defense system
we are testing…

6
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,436
…continues to operate flawlessly.

7
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,480
One might even say…

8
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:04,897
…miraculously.

9
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:09,403
We are navigating under the Arctic ice cap
by dead reckoning

10
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,988
and five days from home.

11
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:14,116
After 25,000 nautical miles,

12
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:18,829
the Sevastopol has deliberately approached
every navy in the world

13
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,832
and remained completely undetected.

14
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:28,672
The Podkova's stealth capability
has exceeded all expectations.

15
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:38,891
We are at this moment the state of the art

16
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,309
of war.

17
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,732
The most fearsome killing machine

18
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,026
ever devised by man.

19
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,781
And we are impossible to find.

20
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:00,746
Captain, we have a submerged contact,
designated Semyon-83,

21
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,540
exhibiting tonals
of a US Virginia-class submarine.

22
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,001
Bearing 130°, drawing forward.

23
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,170
Chief of the Watch,
man battle stations silently.

24
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,632
Officer of the Deck, ship status?

25
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:14,176
Ship's depth, 50 meters.
Bottom, 72 meters.

26
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,470
Clearance to the ice canopy, 21 meters.

27
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,555
-Distance to deep water?
-Two kilometers.

28
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,349
Aleutian Precipice in six minutes.

29
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,809
Ranging maneuver.
Helm, left 15 degrees rudder.

30
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:24,603
Steady course 100°.

31
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,230
Come up easy on a standard bell.

32
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,065
-Captain has the conn.
-Helm, aye!

33
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,234
Coming to course 100°.

34
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,749
Steady on course 100°.

35
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,209
Weapons Officer, range?

36
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:51,296
Firing solution is tracking at a distance
of 15,000 meters.

37
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,466
Sir, that doesn't make sense.
Tonals this loud and clear?

38
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,468
He must be closer than that.

39
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,723
Captain, firing solution just did
a step change to 10,000 meters.

40
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,767
Nothing moves that fast.

41
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,270
All solutions are matching.
The range is true.

42
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,522
Helm, right full rudder to course 270°.

43
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,440
Course 270°, aye.

44
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,196
We'll just walk away
and head for deep water.

45
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,907
Contact bearing 160°.

46
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,784
Bearing rate zero?

47
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,203
He's there, turning with us again.

48
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:26,164
He can see us.

49
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,166
Impossible. We're invisible.

50
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,421
Weapons, run diagnostics on sonar
and fire control. Something isn't right.

51
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,464
Sir, he's flooding his torpedo tubes!

52
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,176
Torpedo room, conn.
Load all torpedo tubes.

53
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,093
Aye, sir.

54
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,557
-Check clear!
-Forward clear!

55
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,143
-Aft clear! Ram torpedo!
-Ramming!

56
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,438
Torpedo tubes loaded.

57
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:50,856
He's opened outer doors!

58
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,108
Weapons, flood tubes one through four
and open outer doors.

59
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:55,068
Enter firing solution into tube two.

60
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:57,863
Aye, Captain.
Making tube two ready in all respects.

61
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,239
Captain, he's provoking us.

62
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:01,742
He wants an excuse
to blow us out of the water.

63
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:05,245
Enemy torpedo in the water, bearing 200°.
1,000 meters and accelerating.

64
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,748
Helm, left full rudder,
all ahead flank cavitate.

65
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,334
My rudder is left full.
Answering all ahead flank cavitate.

66
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,461
-Launch countermeasures.
-Launching countermeasures.

67
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,175
-Fire tube two.
-Firing tube two.

68
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,096
Our torpedo is away. Running hot.

69
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,977
Enemy torpedo still homing,
range 800 meters.

70
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,270
He's blown through our countermeasures.

71
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:32,648
-Helm, right full rudder.
-Right full. Aye, sir!

72
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:33,649
600 meters.

73
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:36,193
Diving Officer, stand by to emergency blow
all main ballast tanks.

74
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,152
400 meters.

75
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:38,320
Chief of the Watch,
stand by the collision alarm.

76
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,696
200 meters.

77
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,406
This is the captain.
All hands brace for impact.

78
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,242
Enemy torpedo impact in…

79
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:45,494
five… four…

80
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:48,580
three… two…

81
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,249
one.

82
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:51,750
Impact!

83
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:05,222
-What just happened?
-It's gone.

84
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,558
-It missed us?
-No.

85
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:11,019
It vanished like it was never there.

86
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:13,564
Sonar, where is the enemy vessel?

87
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,859
Bearing 330°,
4,000 meters off our starboard bow.

88
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,193
Our torpedo is running true.

89
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,571
Impact with enemy submarine in…

90
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:24,199
three… two… one.

91
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:29,872
Where was the impact?

92
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,624
Captain, enemy submarine has vanished.

93
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,418
It's gone, sir.

94
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,086
I don't understand.

95
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,676
He was never there.

96
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,347
We've been chasing a phantom.

97
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:50,184
It was right there.
The instruments don't lie.

98
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,561
They lied to us today.

99
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,397
-Weapons, shut down our torpedo.
-Aye, Captain.

100
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,191
Shutting down torpedo.

101
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,902
Secure from battle stations.

102
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,448
This is why we have sea trials.

103
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,034
There's a bug in the system.

104
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,495
A ghost in the machine.

105
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,958
-It's time to go home.
-Captain!

106
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:18,086
Our own torpedo is not responding.
It's coming right at us!

107
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,215
-Our torpedo's homing, range 400 meters!
-Oh, my God.

108
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,175
Wire command. Shut down our weapon!

109
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:28,013
Our torpedo's still closing,
range 200 meters!

110
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,016
Blow all main ballast tanks!
Sound the collision alar--

111
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,202
Food delivery.

112
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,130
Hello?

113
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:52,598
Designator.

114
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,141
Easy.

115
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:56,685
Easy.

116
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,314
Designator.

117
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,985
India-Zulu-254.

118
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,905
Bravo-Echo-11.

119
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,033
No, not yet.

120
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,619
You need to ask me
the security question first.

121
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,996
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

122
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:19,541
What is the oath?

123
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:26,798
We live and die in the shadows

124
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,010
for those we hold close

125
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,472
and for those we never meet.

126
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,602
You can put it on the table.

127
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,369
Hey.

128
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,832
Welcome to the IMF.

129
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,211
You made the right choice.

130
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,966
Sir.

131
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,431
Good evening, Mr. Hunt.

132
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,434
It's been a long time.

133
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,938
Our lives are the sum of our choices

134
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,775
and we cannot escape the past.

135
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:30,529
Thirty years ago,
you were offered the choice.

136
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:34,408
Join the IMF or spend your life in prison.

137
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:39,955
Because of your unique natural talents,
your government forgave you.

138
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,374
But we will never forget.

139
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:45,002
Just as you will never forget the death

140
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:48,088
that brought you to us
all those years ago.

141
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:07,316
This is to remind you of your oath
and allegiance to us.

142
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,402
The stakes of this mission
are higher than ever.

143
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,822
Your habitual rogue behavior
will not be tolerated.

144
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:18,368
Should you choose to accept,
it is imperative that you listen.

145
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:22,039
Your government is searching for a key.

146
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:25,375
Its purpose, its vital importance to us,

147
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,961
is none of your concern.

148
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:32,758
What should concern you is
the involvement of your friend Ilsa Faust.

149
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:36,803
She killed a courier in Istanbul.

150
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:41,600
And we believe he was carrying one half
of the key we're searching for.

151
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:45,979
Why she has chosen to interfere
in this affair is a mystery,

152
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:48,315
as are her whereabouts.

153
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:53,695
What is certain is that your government
has put a price on her head

154
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:58,534
and these bounty hunters
are out to collect it.

155
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,079
They never bring a fugitive back alive.

156
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,873
And rarely in one piece.

157
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:07,751
We believe they're headed for
the Arabian Desert's Empty Quarter

158
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:09,878
in search of your friend.

159
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:13,674
Find the bounty hunters,
and you may just find her.

160
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:17,636
Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,

161
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:21,181
is to acquire the key
and deliver it to us.

162
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:24,560
What happens to Ilsa after that
is up to you.

163
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:29,481
As always, if any members of your team
are caught or killed,

164
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:32,985
the secretary will disavow
any knowledge of your actions.

165
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:37,698
This message will self-destruct
in five seconds.

166
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,117
Good luck, Ethan.

167
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,068
Come.

168
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,203
Ethan.

169
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,158
So what are we dealing with?

170
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:56,331
This "entity" has multiple personalities,
at times behaving like a computer virus…

171
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,542
…then a tapeworm, then a botnet.

172
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:02,212
Distorting any and all digital information
with which it comes in contact.

173
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:03,338
Once infected,

174
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:07,426
nothing recorded, stored or transmitted
digitally can be trusted as fact.

175
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:11,722
At the outset, it concentrated primarily
on news and social media,

176
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:14,933
which was of little concern to us
as it often suited our purposes.

177
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:16,143
Until six months ago,

178
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:19,438
when the entity breached Saudi Arabia's
General Intelligence Directorate.

179
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:22,858
And assimilated their top secret
active learning AI

180
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:25,194
before vanishing into the cloud.

181
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:28,488
Subsequent attacks increased
ten-thousandfold overnight,

182
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:30,199
spreading exponentially.

183
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:33,660
Indicating that the Entity
has since become

184
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:35,204
sentient.

185
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:37,915
You're telling me this thing
has a mind of its own?

186
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,833
Over the last three weeks alone,

187
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:43,587
it has accessed our satellite
telecommunications, the Federal Reserve,

188
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,215
the stock market
and the national power grid.

189
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:49,510
The FAA, NASA and the combined
branches of our military.

190
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:54,264
And we're not alone. It has penetrated
the World and European Central Banks.

191
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:57,559
Gained entry to the major defense,
finance and infrastructure systems

192
00:16:57,643 --> 00:17:02,105
of Russia, India, Israel, Australasia,
all of Europe.

193
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:05,025
And what did it do
to all of these systems exactly?

194
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,151
Nothing.

195
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:08,111
Nothing?

196
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,530
It came and it went,

197
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:12,574
leaving fingerprints
where they could easily be found

198
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:15,493
and sending a very clear message.

199
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:18,789
"I shall return."

200
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:22,626
Whatever its ultimate goal is,
we're powerless to stop it.

201
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:26,588
The full force of its energy is now
directed at a single objective.

202
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:28,507
The world's intelligence networks.

203
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,926
The very truth as we know it.

204
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:35,681
The entire intelligence community
is racing to archive hard copies

205
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,850
of our fact-positive knowledge bases

206
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:41,854
before our most secure data centers
are breached and corrupted.

207
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:43,772
Which is only a matter of time.

208
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:45,816
The Entity will know precisely

209
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:49,695
how to undermine our every strength
and exploit our every weakness.

210
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:52,406
How to turn our allies into enemies

211
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:55,576
and our enemies into aggressors.

212
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:58,328
Why not air-gap our intelligence servers?

213
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:00,706
Cut them off
from the outside world entirely?

214
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:02,124
We already have.

215
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:05,460
But servers require humans
to maintain them.

216
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:08,714
And humans are the weakest link
in any security chain,

217
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:12,843
especially when dealing with
a godless, stateless, amoral enemy.

218
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:16,763
One that has been patiently listening,
reading, watching.

219
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:20,100
Harvesting our deepest personal secrets
for years.

220
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:25,314
Able to beguile, blackmail, bribe
or be anyone it wants.

221
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:29,026
And to manipulate us at will
through our total dependence

222
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:32,029
on a carefully constructed
digital reality.

223
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:34,364
An enemy that is everywhere

224
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:37,242
and nowhere

225
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:39,161
and has no center.

226
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:46,418
All right, so what you're telling me is,

227
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:51,173
the most awesome goddamn intelligence
and tactical apparatus on the planet

228
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:54,676
has no way of killing this thing.

229
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,845
You don't want to kill it, sir.

230
00:18:58,388 --> 00:18:59,932
You want to control it.

231
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:03,101
And how do we do that, Mr. Kittridge?

232
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,563
The CIA's assets in the Kremlin
informed us

233
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:11,109
that the Russians have focused the
majority of their intelligence activity

234
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:14,571
on acquiring two halves
of a cruciform key.

235
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:18,158
-And what does it unlock?
-Not exactly sure.

236
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:21,411
But the Russians seem to believe
that it somehow has

237
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:24,373
the power to deactivate
our mysterious Entity.

238
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:25,791
Though, ideally,

239
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:30,128
they hope to control it, harness it.

240
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:32,506
Do you believe that, Kittridge?

241
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:37,386
What matters is that
the rest of the world believes it.

242
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:40,264
Japan, India, Germany
and the Brits believe it.

243
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:42,099
And yet no one,

244
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,142
not even our closest allies,

245
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:47,062
have willingly whispered
one word of it to us.

246
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:49,731
Which would indicate
that there's a global race on

247
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:52,693
to acquire the two halves of this key.

248
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:57,781
Every nation in it for themselves,
not to kill this thing, sir,

249
00:19:58,574 --> 00:20:00,242
but to weaponize it.

250
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:04,663
And, in so doing, establish
a new, incontestable form

251
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:06,290
of global dominance.

252
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:07,958
How do we find this key first?

253
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:11,545
Well, we know that a buyer is passing
somewhere through the Middle East

254
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:14,506
sometime in the next 72 hours.

255
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,759
We believe that he already has
one half of this key.

256
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:18,886
You believe.

257
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:21,221
At this point, we can't be certain
it's not a counterfeit.

258
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:22,723
How would you verify that?

259
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:26,018
The only thing that can authenticate
one genuine half of the key is

260
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:29,271
the other genuine half of the key--
its true mate, if you will.

261
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:31,940
We think it's some sort of fail-safe.

262
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:33,150
How do we find its mate?

263
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:36,612
Well, we believe
the other genuine half of the key

264
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:38,947
was in the hands of this woman.

265
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:40,199
Who is she?

266
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:41,700
Ilsa Faust.

267
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,285
Former British Intelligence.

268
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:46,038
-Where is she now?
-She's dead, sir.

269
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:48,040
She was-- excuse me--

270
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:51,627
killed by mercenaries
looking to collect a bounty.

271
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,003
And who put up the bounty?

272
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,506
Given her body of work,
could have been anyone.

273
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,633
So anyone could have her half of the key?

274
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,552
Not just anyone.

275
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,305
I sent a man to find her.

276
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:06,350
The only man she would have entrusted
with her half of the key.

277
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:08,227
Does he have it, Kittridge?

278
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:12,272
Well, at present, I don't know that, sir.
He's refused to come in.

279
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:14,358
Refused?

280
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:16,401
Who the hell is this guy?

281
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:18,028
That's classified.

282
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:21,198
I'm the goddamn
Director of National Intelligence.

283
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,242
What exactly is it
I'm not supposed to know about?

284
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:24,409
The IMF.

285
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:25,994
-Mr. Kittridge.
-The world bank.

286
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:27,412
No, that's
the International Monetary Fund.

287
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:30,999
-Mr. Kittridge.
-No, I mean the other IMF. Ours.

288
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,584
What does it stand for?

289
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:35,754
Impossible Mission Force.

290
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:39,341
-You're not serious.
-I'm afraid he is.

291
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:41,051
And what do they do exactly?

292
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:44,388
It's just as the name implies.
Whatever the rest of us can't.

293
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:45,556
And who is in charge?

294
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:49,351
They're not ones to take orders
in the traditional sense. We more or less…

295
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:52,604
leave word.

296
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:56,024
Leave word.

297
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:57,651
Mr. Kittridge, sir.

298
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:01,363
The IMF operates outside the community
and answers directly to the president.

299
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:02,781
So let me get this straight.

300
00:22:02,865 --> 00:22:06,285
When there's a mission
none of you can handle,

301
00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:11,164
you just leave word for a nameless man

302
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:13,792
and hope he gets the job done.

303
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:14,793
Is that it?

304
00:22:14,877 --> 00:22:18,046
Should he choose to accept it.

305
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:21,466
What the hell kind of outfit
gets to choose what orders to accept?

306
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,343
The IMF was expressly created

307
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:27,055
to ensure there would be
no unintended consequences.

308
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:30,225
If they cannot ensure
a mission's ultimate outcome,

309
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:32,561
they're authorized to decline.

310
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:25,531
I understand.

311
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:27,366
You're upset.

312
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:30,035
I'm not upset, Kittridge.

313
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:33,330
You wanted me to listen.

314
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:37,084
This is me listening.

315
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:39,878
All right.

316
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,089
I put the bounty on Ilsa's head.

317
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:44,299
I also told you how to find her!

318
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:49,388
And I didn't ask her to steal the key.
She did that for reasons of her own.

319
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:53,559
But that's the pattern, isn't it?

320
00:23:55,394 --> 00:24:00,274
You get her out of trouble
and she always found her way back in.

321
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:12,202
Wait! Ilsa.

322
00:24:12,286 --> 00:24:14,872
Ilsa, wait! It's me!

323
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:15,914
It's me.

324
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:23,881
It's okay.

325
00:24:57,456 --> 00:25:00,417
Listen to me! You're dead! You stay dead!

326
00:25:01,168 --> 00:25:02,878
Ethan, wait!

327
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:09,593
I'm not going to apologize to you, Hunt.

328
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,970
It's my job to use you.

329
00:25:12,054 --> 00:25:14,723
Just like it's your job to be of use.

330
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:18,477
Did you accomplish your mission or not?

331
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:25,609
Wherever the other half of this is,

332
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:28,779
whatever the completed key unlocks,

333
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:30,364
I will find it.

334
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,575
And then what?

335
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,704
No one should be trusted
with control of the Entity.

336
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:40,123
I mean to kill it.

337
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:41,041
Ethan,

338
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,627
the next world war
isn't gonna be a cold one.

339
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,672
It's gonna be a shooting war,
a ballistic war

340
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:48,674
over a rapidly shrinking ecosystem.

341
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:51,844
It's gonna be a war
for the last of our dwindling energy,

342
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:54,263
drinkable water, breathable air.

343
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:58,350
Whoever controls the Entity
controls the truth.

344
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,062
The concepts of right and wrong

345
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:06,483
can be clearly defined for everyone
for centuries to come.

346
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:08,235
Do you even hear yourself?

347
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:13,323
Your days of fighting
for the so-called greater good

348
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:15,659
are over.

349
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:18,662
You need to pick a side.

350
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:21,748
I'm on the same side I've always been on.

351
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:25,043
Stay out of my way.

352
00:26:25,836 --> 00:26:27,462
I can't do that.

353
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:32,593
We're gonna be coming after you.
The world's gonna be coming after you.

354
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:36,680
And one way or another,
this mission of yours

355
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:40,767
is gonna cost you dearly.

356
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,446
If I don't get that,
we're gonna have company real soon.

357
00:27:09,588 --> 00:27:10,547
Hello?

358
00:27:10,631 --> 00:27:12,257
Director Denlinger, please.

359
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:16,512
Director is unavailable at the moment.
How can I help you?

360
00:27:16,595 --> 00:27:19,806
-To whom am I speaking?
-CIA Director Eugene Kittridge.

361
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,518
-Designator?
-"Bassnote," lowercase, all one word.

362
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:25,896
-Sir, we have a situation.
-No kidding.

363
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:29,858
Your adjutant was found unconscious
in his home ten minutes ago.

364
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:31,276
It appears he was drugged.

365
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,945
I understand.

366
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:34,363
I don't think you do, sir.

367
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:37,699
Security has him entering this facility
15 minutes ago.

368
00:27:37,783 --> 00:27:39,409
I understand, thank you.

369
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:41,995
Are you able to speak freely?

370
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:45,123
-No, thank you.
-A security team is on their way.

371
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:48,335
If you're in any danger, simply hang up
the phone before I count to five.

372
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:50,003
One, two--

373
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,802
So just how do you plan
on getting out of here?

374
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:03,475
Of course.

375
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,546
Listen up.

376
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:17,424
An American operative
with a grievance against his country

377
00:29:17,508 --> 00:29:19,927
is missing and has malfunctioned.

378
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,930
His agenda represents a threat
to our national interests

379
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:25,474
and he must be neutralized at all cost.

380
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:28,810
Anything in this man's possession
is of vital importance

381
00:29:28,894 --> 00:29:31,063
and must be captured intact.

382
00:29:31,146 --> 00:29:33,774
The man himself is expendable.

383
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:35,943
He is not to be underestimated.

384
00:29:36,026 --> 00:29:40,614
A master of infiltration, deception,
sabotage and psych warfare.

385
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:43,283
For all intents and purposes,
ladies and gentlemen,

386
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:46,203
a mind-reading, shape-shifting
incarnation of chaos.

387
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:50,832
So, for your safety
and the safety of those around you,

388
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:52,668
do not consider him secure

389
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:56,588
unless you have driven a wooden stake
through his open heart.

390
00:29:57,256 --> 00:29:59,383
This is not a drill.

391
00:30:00,968 --> 00:30:04,263
A self-aware, self-learning,

392
00:30:04,346 --> 00:30:06,932
truth-eating digital parasite

393
00:30:07,808 --> 00:30:10,352
infesting all of cyberspace.

394
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:13,772
Well, it was bound to happen
sooner or later.

395
00:30:13,856 --> 00:30:15,649
And the two halves of this key

396
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:19,736
just might provide the means
of controlling this Entity.

397
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,907
Meaning every government on the planet
would kill us just to get that key.

398
00:30:23,991 --> 00:30:25,075
Including our own.

399
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:26,243
Exactly.

400
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:28,370
Putting us on an unsanctioned mission

401
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:30,998
which has gone rogue
before it even started.

402
00:30:31,081 --> 00:30:36,044
Meaning this very conversation
is technically an act of treason.

403
00:30:36,128 --> 00:30:39,381
Or as we like to call it, Monday.

404
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:42,718
So what's the play?

405
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:46,847
A buyer's coming in on Flight 746
from Amsterdam for a 30-minute layover,

406
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:50,100
at which time he is hoping to purchase
that half of the key.

407
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:52,769
And it stands to reason
the buyer will have

408
00:30:52,853 --> 00:30:54,813
the other half of the key
somewhere on their person.

409
00:30:54,897 --> 00:30:57,900
Being the only way
to authenticate our half.

410
00:30:57,983 --> 00:30:59,860
So how do we identify the buyer?

411
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:01,111
This Geiger counter

412
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:03,405
will detect a radiological signature
of the dragon's egg

413
00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:05,073
embedded in the buyer's key.

414
00:31:05,157 --> 00:31:07,993
The augmented-reality overlay
in these glasses

415
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:09,620
will lead us to it.

416
00:31:11,496 --> 00:31:12,956
Oh, that's very clever.

417
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:17,085
So, you ID the buyer, pick his pockets,
Bob's your uncle.

418
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:19,713
-No.
-No. Of course not.

419
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:22,633
The complete key is of no value
if we don't know what it unlocks.

420
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:26,512
So you're going to sell the buyer
our half of the key.

421
00:31:26,595 --> 00:31:29,056
While we figure out
the buyer's connecting flight

422
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:31,099
and book you a seat on that plane.

423
00:31:31,183 --> 00:31:34,144
So you can follow the key
wherever it goes.

424
00:31:34,228 --> 00:31:37,481
Which you hope is into the hands
of someone who knows what it unlocks.

425
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:38,440
Precisely.

426
00:31:38,524 --> 00:31:40,734
Finding the completed key

427
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,861
is only the beginning.

428
00:31:42,945 --> 00:31:47,824
The fate of the world depends on
finding whatever it unlocks.

429
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:53,747
This guy, you know him?

430
00:31:54,873 --> 00:31:56,542
Not personally.

431
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:58,460
But it is personal.

432
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:29,783
Thank you.

433
00:32:36,206 --> 00:32:37,666
-Hey, what's that?
-What?

434
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:40,377
Security alert.
Suspicious bag on its way to Venice.

435
00:32:41,295 --> 00:32:43,505
Nope, it's gone.
Must have been a false alarm.

436
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,224
Overwatch, Snap Shot. Where's he at?

437
00:32:58,187 --> 00:32:59,938
Snap Shot, Overwatch. I have him.

438
00:33:00,022 --> 00:33:02,816
Terminal B, Gate 15, headed south.

439
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,820
-I am so.
-You are not.

440
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:10,699
Ethan, would you care to explain
to our friend, the Net Ranger,

441
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:12,993
how I am just as capable
of writing code as he is?

442
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:13,911
No comment.

443
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:15,662
What, you figure Phineas Phreak here

444
00:33:15,746 --> 00:33:17,915
is gonna single-handedly work out
a way to kill the Entity

445
00:33:17,998 --> 00:33:19,917
while I just hold his soldering iron?

446
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,752
-Probably.
-Definitely.

447
00:33:22,878 --> 00:33:24,171
Out of the way!

448
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,548
Tell me where he is.

449
00:33:26,632 --> 00:33:29,843
-Where is he?
-Blue suit. Right in front of you.

450
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:57,371
-It's not him.
-It's him.

451
00:33:57,454 --> 00:33:59,706
-I'm telling you, it's not him.
-And I'm telling you,

452
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,959
facial comes back with a perfect--

453
00:34:05,796 --> 00:34:07,214
How did you do that?

454
00:34:07,297 --> 00:34:10,676
No one is safe from Phineas Phreak.

455
00:34:18,058 --> 00:34:19,560
-I got him!
-Where is he?

456
00:34:19,643 --> 00:34:21,603
Terminal E, Gate 5.

457
00:34:21,687 --> 00:34:24,565
Goddamn it, that's clear on the other side
of the airport.

458
00:34:27,275 --> 00:34:32,197
Ethan, they're headed to Terminal E.
That side of the airport is all yours.

459
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:35,449
-Thank you, Luther. I see the buyer.
-Got him.

460
00:34:35,534 --> 00:34:38,536
The buyer is Otto Von Bork.
Swiss national.

461
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:43,000
He's connecting to Venice,
departing in 30 minutes on Flight 1031.

462
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:45,043
Benji, get me on that flight to Venice.

463
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:47,629
Yep, Flight 1031 to Venice. Stand by.

464
00:35:00,142 --> 00:35:01,894
Ethan, what just happened?

465
00:35:01,977 --> 00:35:04,813
-He was bumped.
-Bumped? What do you mean, bumped?

466
00:35:04,897 --> 00:35:08,108
That woman picked his pocket.
Tag her. Tell me who she is.

467
00:35:17,034 --> 00:35:18,452
Luther, mute our comms.

468
00:35:18,994 --> 00:35:21,371
-What is it?
-That bag was on its way to Flight 1031.

469
00:35:21,455 --> 00:35:22,664
What bag?

470
00:35:22,748 --> 00:35:25,250
There was a suspicious bag alert
a few minutes ago.

471
00:35:25,334 --> 00:35:28,128
-So what about it?
-It was on its way to Flight 1031.

472
00:35:28,212 --> 00:35:31,507
To Venice. It's the buyer's plane.
It's Ethan's plane.

473
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,967
Luther, do you copy? Who is she?

474
00:35:34,051 --> 00:35:35,677
What if it wasn't a false alarm?

475
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:37,804
What if somebody's trying to
smuggle a bomb onto that plane?

476
00:35:37,888 --> 00:35:41,642
And what if that's what the Entity wants
us to think to keep Ethan off that plane?

477
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:43,685
-Luther, what's happening?
-Should we warn him?

478
00:35:44,269 --> 00:35:46,438
-No.
-Guys, guys? You hear me?

479
00:35:46,522 --> 00:35:49,191
Find that bag. I'll direct you. Go.

480
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:51,568
Luther, just tell me,
is there something wrong?

481
00:35:51,652 --> 00:35:54,947
Nothing to worry about.
It's under control.

482
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,948
Got her.

483
00:35:56,031 --> 00:35:58,784
Info on the woman is coming… now.

484
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:05,582
Whoever she is, she's no spy.

485
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:07,668
She's a thief.

486
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:09,086
Where am I going, Luther?

487
00:36:09,169 --> 00:36:11,380
Benji, there's a door
on your immediate left.

488
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:13,924
I'm unlocking it now.

489
00:36:17,427 --> 00:36:20,639
The bag you're after is on tray 01833

490
00:36:20,722 --> 00:36:23,559
heading towards the northwest corner
of the facility.

491
00:36:23,642 --> 00:36:24,893
Copy that!

492
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:36,780
Hi.

493
00:36:38,991 --> 00:36:40,242
Hello.

494
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:45,706
Oh, I get it.

495
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:48,250
You thought I was someone else.

496
00:36:50,294 --> 00:36:51,628
I'm not interested.

497
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:54,631
Give me a chance.

498
00:36:55,299 --> 00:36:56,300
I'll scream.

499
00:36:58,135 --> 00:36:59,386
Please do.

500
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:03,807
What do you want?

501
00:37:05,017 --> 00:37:06,185
This key.

502
00:37:08,103 --> 00:37:10,397
The one you picked from that man's pocket.

503
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,899
It's worthless

504
00:37:11,982 --> 00:37:13,025
without this key.

505
00:37:15,277 --> 00:37:16,904
But together

506
00:37:16,987 --> 00:37:18,739
they're worth four million
in cryptocurrency

507
00:37:18,822 --> 00:37:20,532
that man was carrying on a flash drive.

508
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:24,411
Well, I wouldn't know anything about that.

509
00:37:24,494 --> 00:37:26,079
Then why was this drive in your pocket?

510
00:37:27,748 --> 00:37:29,499
Who are you?

511
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:31,251
You working with someone?

512
00:37:31,793 --> 00:37:34,379
Never. I'm strictly single-0.

513
00:37:34,463 --> 00:37:36,089
Today you got a partner.

514
00:37:36,173 --> 00:37:37,382
I need the man you stole this from

515
00:37:37,466 --> 00:37:40,469
to complete a transaction
and leave this airport with both of these

516
00:37:40,552 --> 00:37:42,137
without ever knowing his pocket was picked

517
00:37:42,221 --> 00:37:43,472
and before he boards his flight in--

518
00:37:43,555 --> 00:37:46,099
-Seven minutes.
-Seven minutes.

519
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:49,353
We both know you're a good pickpocket.

520
00:37:49,436 --> 00:37:51,355
Let's see what kind of put-pocket you are.

521
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:55,859
You expect me to put it back.

522
00:37:55,943 --> 00:37:57,986
Oh, I know you will.

523
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:00,405
You're a thief. You want the money.

524
00:38:00,489 --> 00:38:02,282
And I can give it to you.

525
00:38:03,033 --> 00:38:06,662
Your choice. You're in or you're out.

526
00:38:09,206 --> 00:38:10,707
All right.

527
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:11,875
So what's the play?

528
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:14,002
I sure hope you know what you're doing.

529
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,963
After you.

530
00:38:17,923 --> 00:38:20,467
Oh, I won't be needing this.

531
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:22,511
I don't smoke.

532
00:38:23,387 --> 00:38:25,973
Keep it. Something to remember me by.

533
00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:35,941
Ethan, the alloy in that key
she took off the buyer doesn't match.

534
00:38:36,024 --> 00:38:38,694
-It's counterfeit.
-I expect nothing less.

535
00:38:38,777 --> 00:38:41,947
But that doesn't change our objective.
The buyer has to leave with both keys.

536
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,907
Talk to me, Luther! Where am I going?

537
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:45,909
Benji, head down the stairs
in front of you

538
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:47,369
and the bag should be right there.

539
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:48,996
Okay. I'm there. I'm there.

540
00:38:54,418 --> 00:38:55,669
That's him.

541
00:38:55,752 --> 00:38:57,337
Right in front of you.

542
00:38:58,797 --> 00:39:02,259
Okay, okay. Hey, sorry.
Thought you were somebody else.

543
00:39:03,969 --> 00:39:05,888
Hunt's jerking our chain.

544
00:39:06,555 --> 00:39:09,391
Everybody! Two-man teams, spread out.

545
00:39:09,474 --> 00:39:12,436
Ethan, our American friends
are getting wise.

546
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:14,062
They're breaking up
and canvassing the airport.

547
00:39:14,146 --> 00:39:15,564
Keep your eyes peeled.

548
00:39:15,647 --> 00:39:17,357
So, what do I call you?

549
00:39:17,441 --> 00:39:19,818
How about Grace? And you?

550
00:39:19,902 --> 00:39:21,737
Well, listen, Grace.

551
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,530
You should know
we're not the only interested party.

552
00:39:23,614 --> 00:39:25,490
If I tell you to run, you run.

553
00:39:25,574 --> 00:39:26,950
Run?

554
00:39:27,034 --> 00:39:28,535
This is getting exciting.

555
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,662
Benji, have you got that bag?

556
00:39:30,746 --> 00:39:32,289
I found it!

557
00:39:45,844 --> 00:39:49,806
There's a cylindrical device inside.
I'm gonna take it out.

558
00:39:54,102 --> 00:39:55,062
How we doing, Luther?

559
00:39:55,646 --> 00:39:58,106
Ethan, the buyer's
in the waiting area above you.

560
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,025
Top of the escalator.

561
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:03,737
All units are headed in your direction.

562
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,823
Your location is going to be crawling
with agents anytime now.

563
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:18,335
Whatever it is, I've just activated it.

564
00:40:21,004 --> 00:40:23,006
Looks like we have five minutes.

565
00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:27,427
-Also, it appears to be nuclear.
-How big?

566
00:40:27,511 --> 00:40:29,471
Big enough to matter to everybody
in this airport, I suspect.

567
00:40:29,555 --> 00:40:32,015
-Can you disarm it?
-I haven't got any tools!

568
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:34,268
-Then find some.
-Where am I gonna find--

569
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:00,127
Is this where we run?

570
00:41:00,836 --> 00:41:01,670
Not yet.

571
00:41:02,629 --> 00:41:04,464
Benji, how are you doing with that bomb?

572
00:41:04,548 --> 00:41:05,549
Come on, come on.

573
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:08,135
I got it!

574
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,556
It's a cylinder cypher.
There's eight wheels.

575
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:14,766
Looks like 14 letters on each wheel.

576
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:17,477
1.5 billion possible combinations.

577
00:41:17,561 --> 00:41:18,896
Give or take.

578
00:41:20,147 --> 00:41:21,315
Oh, my God.

579
00:41:21,398 --> 00:41:23,025
What now?

580
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:25,485
The wheels-- They spell out a message.

581
00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:27,154
U.R.DUNN.

582
00:41:27,237 --> 00:41:28,864
No way. Not yet, we aren't.

583
00:41:28,947 --> 00:41:30,824
No, Luther, not D-O-N-E.

584
00:41:30,908 --> 00:41:33,327
D-U-N-N.

585
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,495
It's my last name.

586
00:41:39,374 --> 00:41:40,876
It knows who I am.

587
00:41:53,722 --> 00:41:55,432
Hold on. There's a message on the display.

588
00:41:56,058 --> 00:42:00,479
"I speak without a mouth, I fly through
the air without wings. What am I?"

589
00:42:00,562 --> 00:42:01,688
You got me. What?

590
00:42:01,772 --> 00:42:04,274
It's a riddle.
I suspect this thing is voice-activated.

591
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:05,526
It wants me to say the answer.

592
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:07,611
"I fly through the air…"

593
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:09,530
An echo!

594
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:11,240
That's it! That's it!

595
00:42:11,323 --> 00:42:12,699
Okay, new message.

596
00:42:12,783 --> 00:42:15,369
"Are you afraid of death?"

597
00:42:15,452 --> 00:42:17,663
-What kind of a riddle is that?
-It's not a riddle.

598
00:42:17,746 --> 00:42:19,915
It's a psychometric test.

599
00:42:19,998 --> 00:42:23,669
The more questions you answer,
the more it'll know about you.

600
00:42:23,752 --> 00:42:25,671
"Are you afraid of death?" No!

601
00:42:26,964 --> 00:42:29,967
-Did it work?
-I lied. It knows.

602
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,302
Just tell it the truth. Say it.

603
00:42:32,386 --> 00:42:35,180
"Are you afraid of death?" Yes! Who isn't?

604
00:42:45,107 --> 00:42:48,902
Okay. "What's always approaching
but never arrives?"

605
00:42:48,986 --> 00:42:50,195
Wait, I know this one.

606
00:42:50,279 --> 00:42:51,697
The clock is ticking, Luther.

607
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,782
Riddles aren't my thing, Benji.
What more can I say?

608
00:42:53,866 --> 00:42:55,576
We're running out of time!

609
00:42:56,118 --> 00:42:57,661
There he is.

610
00:42:57,744 --> 00:42:59,413
Oh, this is too easy.

611
00:42:59,496 --> 00:43:01,331
Sorry to bother you, Ethan.

612
00:43:01,415 --> 00:43:04,126
Would you happen to know
what's always approaching

613
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:06,128
but never arrives?

614
00:43:06,211 --> 00:43:08,547
What is always approaching
but never arrives?

615
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:09,673
Tomorrow.

616
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,175
What?

617
00:43:11,258 --> 00:43:13,760
Always approaching but never arrives.
Tomorrow.

618
00:43:14,845 --> 00:43:16,221
-It's tomorrow.
-Tomorrow.

619
00:43:16,305 --> 00:43:17,848
Tomorrow! Tomorrow!

620
00:43:17,931 --> 00:43:19,558
Yes! Okay, next question.

621
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:20,767
Give me the goods.

622
00:43:21,643 --> 00:43:24,104
-I'll be watching.
-You don't trust me?

623
00:43:30,068 --> 00:43:31,570
Luther, what is happening?

624
00:43:31,653 --> 00:43:35,073
Nothing to worry about.
Everything is under control.

625
00:43:35,157 --> 00:43:35,991
Okay, next question.

626
00:43:36,074 --> 00:43:39,036
"Who or what is
the most important thing to you?"

627
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,329
Say it.

628
00:43:40,412 --> 00:43:42,456
-But if I--
-There's no other choice. Say it.

629
00:43:43,332 --> 00:43:44,833
My friends.

630
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:46,585
Bastard.

631
00:43:58,347 --> 00:44:00,349
-Is he--
-Yes, he is.

632
00:44:00,432 --> 00:44:02,351
Give me the money, give me the key.

633
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:06,063
Okay. "What gets bigger
the more you take away?"

634
00:44:06,146 --> 00:44:08,482
-A hole.
-A hole. Brilliant!

635
00:44:20,702 --> 00:44:22,287
I've got no more questions
and there's one more wheel.

636
00:44:22,371 --> 00:44:24,540
How am I supposed to give answers
if I've got no questions?

637
00:44:24,623 --> 00:44:26,041
That must be your final test.

638
00:44:26,124 --> 00:44:27,876
I've got 45 seconds!

639
00:44:31,213 --> 00:44:32,589
What happens now?

640
00:44:32,673 --> 00:44:34,716
I'm thinking. Don't move.

641
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,344
I'm pinned down. Need a way out of here.
Where am I going?

642
00:44:37,427 --> 00:44:38,762
We have a bigger problem, Ethan.

643
00:44:38,846 --> 00:44:40,931
It's very possible
no one is getting out of here.

644
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:41,849
What?

645
00:44:41,932 --> 00:44:44,685
There's a bomb in baggage handling.
A nuclear bomb.

646
00:44:44,768 --> 00:44:47,312
The question I asked you
is part of the code for disarming it.

647
00:44:47,396 --> 00:44:48,730
Stop, stop, stop!

648
00:44:50,983 --> 00:44:52,067
Why didn't you tell me this?

649
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:54,319
You had a lot going on.
We didn't want to bother you.

650
00:44:54,403 --> 00:44:58,198
Listen to me. A nuclear bomb is something
you bother me with immediately.

651
00:44:58,282 --> 00:44:59,741
-How much time?
-Twenty seconds.

652
00:45:00,534 --> 00:45:01,577
Twenty seconds?

653
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,996
There's one more riddle.
I'm working on it. Fifteen seconds!

654
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,081
Easy, easy. What's the riddle?

655
00:45:06,164 --> 00:45:08,208
In the time it takes me to explain,
we'll all be dead!

656
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:09,126
Come on, Benji.

657
00:45:09,209 --> 00:45:11,086
Why do we always
end up in these situations?

658
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:12,629
Ten seconds.

659
00:45:12,713 --> 00:45:14,256
Nine… eight…

660
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:17,467
seven… six… five…

661
00:45:28,812 --> 00:45:29,980
Oh, my God.

662
00:45:30,063 --> 00:45:30,939
What is it?

663
00:45:32,774 --> 00:45:35,110
-It's empty.
-What do you mean, empty?

664
00:45:35,194 --> 00:45:36,528
There's nothing inside.

665
00:45:41,992 --> 00:45:42,910
She took the key.

666
00:45:42,993 --> 00:45:44,995
-Which key?
-Our key. The real key.

667
00:45:45,078 --> 00:45:46,038
-What?
-Luther, find her.

668
00:45:56,465 --> 00:45:58,050
I got her. She's headed for Terminal E.

669
00:46:10,562 --> 00:46:12,523
-No, it can't be.
-What is it?

670
00:46:13,065 --> 00:46:14,650
Luther, Benji. Abort. Get out!

671
00:46:14,733 --> 00:46:16,860
-Where do we rendezvous?
-We don't!

672
00:46:16,944 --> 00:46:19,613
This mission is terminated. Get out now.

673
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:33,919
Hunt! Stop right there!

674
00:46:34,002 --> 00:46:35,838
You see him? Where is he?

675
00:46:35,921 --> 00:46:37,714
Excuse me! Excuse me!

676
00:46:37,798 --> 00:46:40,008
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

677
00:47:17,713 --> 00:47:19,673
-Move!
-Move, move!

678
00:48:01,798 --> 00:48:03,800
He's got to be here somewhere.

679
00:48:05,093 --> 00:48:06,887
Goddamn.

680
00:48:17,439 --> 00:48:20,025
What we have here is shortwave radio,

681
00:48:20,108 --> 00:48:24,655
magnetic audio recording,
cathode ray tube monitors.

682
00:48:24,738 --> 00:48:27,366
No more ones and zeros.

683
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:30,369
It's a fully analog, offline safe room,

684
00:48:30,452 --> 00:48:33,372
shielded from our digitally-based Entity.

685
00:48:34,665 --> 00:48:36,583
Where is this feed coming from?

686
00:48:36,667 --> 00:48:39,837
CORONA spy satellite from the Cold War.

687
00:48:40,546 --> 00:48:42,464
Had no idea we were still
using those things.

688
00:48:42,548 --> 00:48:44,216
Yeah, well, we weren't.

689
00:48:44,299 --> 00:48:46,510
Gave them to the National Weather Service
20 years ago.

690
00:48:46,593 --> 00:48:48,679
This is the last one still functioning.

691
00:48:48,762 --> 00:48:52,808
So, will this thing help us find
your nameless IMF man?

692
00:48:52,891 --> 00:48:54,852
Nothing can do that, sir.

693
00:48:54,935 --> 00:48:58,564
But it has allowed us
to keep tabs on this woman.

694
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,318
She was seen with our man
at the airport in Abu Dhabi.

695
00:49:04,403 --> 00:49:05,404
Who is she?

696
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:08,240
Where is she now?

697
00:49:19,626 --> 00:49:23,422
You are here because Italian police
received an anonymous tip

698
00:49:23,505 --> 00:49:25,424
that a woman matching your description

699
00:49:25,507 --> 00:49:28,760
would be arriving on the afternoon flight
from Abu Dhabi.

700
00:49:28,844 --> 00:49:32,764
This woman had
multiple passports in her possession.

701
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:36,935
This one is wanted for fraud
in Saint Petersburg.

702
00:49:37,644 --> 00:49:40,814
Jewel theft in Antwerp.
Art theft in Monaco.

703
00:49:40,898 --> 00:49:44,193
Graft in Milan. Extortion in Mumbai.

704
00:49:44,276 --> 00:49:46,737
But this is my favorite--

705
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,947
resisting arrest in Rio.

706
00:49:51,241 --> 00:49:53,202
Which leads me to wonder,

707
00:49:54,286 --> 00:49:55,913
which one of these women is you?

708
00:49:56,955 --> 00:49:59,124
I've never seen these before in my life.

709
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:00,626
They were in your purse.

710
00:50:00,709 --> 00:50:03,629
And your picture is in every one.

711
00:50:03,712 --> 00:50:05,881
-May I see?
-Please.

712
00:50:11,595 --> 00:50:13,222
Yes, it's an amazing likeness,

713
00:50:13,305 --> 00:50:15,390
but it isn't me.

714
00:50:16,183 --> 00:50:17,726
As I keep telling you,

715
00:50:18,936 --> 00:50:22,189
I'm a schoolteacher from Brighton.
I'm on a sabbatical.

716
00:50:22,272 --> 00:50:24,399
Whatever you're involved in,

717
00:50:24,483 --> 00:50:28,028
you've obviously made
some very powerful enemies.

718
00:50:38,705 --> 00:50:39,540
Okay.

719
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,003
Her lawyer is here.

720
00:50:45,087 --> 00:50:46,463
My lawyer?

721
00:51:21,748 --> 00:51:23,625
Magistrate Spezzi.

722
00:51:24,251 --> 00:51:25,586
I'm sorry. Who are you?

723
00:51:26,211 --> 00:51:27,880
Interpol.

724
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:32,926
I've come regarding the arrest
of the woman from Abu Dhabi.

725
00:51:33,468 --> 00:51:36,597
I'll need to inventory the items
on her person at the time of her arrest.

726
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:39,725
May I see some identification, please?

727
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:41,518
Where's the rest?

728
00:51:42,269 --> 00:51:44,062
I assure you, this is everything.

729
00:51:44,605 --> 00:51:47,482
-What was your name?
-She left Abu Dhabi with a certain key.

730
00:51:48,108 --> 00:51:49,443
There was no key.

731
00:51:49,526 --> 00:51:51,445
It was an unusual sort.

732
00:51:52,487 --> 00:51:54,948
One that you could mistake for a pendant.

733
00:51:55,657 --> 00:51:59,244
The kind that you'd be tempted
to hang on a chain

734
00:51:59,328 --> 00:52:00,829
around Amelia's neck.

735
00:52:02,664 --> 00:52:03,624
Amelia?

736
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:05,918
Your wife.

737
00:52:06,627 --> 00:52:09,546
Mother of your lovely daughter, Serena.

738
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:11,548
You're not Interpol.

739
00:52:11,632 --> 00:52:13,634
I am if I wish to be.

740
00:52:14,718 --> 00:52:17,804
I can be anything, and I know everything.

741
00:52:18,388 --> 00:52:21,767
I know this wouldn't be the first time
you've helped yourself to stolen goods.

742
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:22,935
A Cartier bracelet.

743
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:25,687
You were cleared of suspicion,

744
00:52:25,771 --> 00:52:27,814
but we both know you gave it
to your mistress, Valeria.

745
00:52:28,357 --> 00:52:31,860
On August 21st. Her 29th birthday.

746
00:52:31,944 --> 00:52:33,779
Who are you?

747
00:52:35,697 --> 00:52:37,908
I'm gonna have to search you,

748
00:52:37,991 --> 00:52:39,243
just to be sure.

749
00:52:43,664 --> 00:52:46,208
Your secretary's no longer with us.

750
00:52:59,429 --> 00:53:00,848
Thank you officers.

751
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:04,434
Please.

752
00:53:05,644 --> 00:53:07,938
You can wait outside. Thank you.

753
00:53:24,496 --> 00:53:26,039
You.

754
00:53:26,123 --> 00:53:27,666
You did this.

755
00:53:27,749 --> 00:53:32,171
I called the police. I didn't tell them
about your colorful past.

756
00:53:33,589 --> 00:53:34,882
That's on you.

757
00:53:35,424 --> 00:53:39,553
You put-pocketed that key on another
passenger before you were arrested.

758
00:53:39,636 --> 00:53:42,556
You exchanged details
and arranged to meet later on.

759
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:44,224
Right now someone out there

760
00:53:44,308 --> 00:53:46,935
hasn't the slightest clue
they're holding on to that key for you.

761
00:53:47,644 --> 00:53:50,480
An unwitting courier.
The perfect accomplice.

762
00:53:51,773 --> 00:53:55,068
I'm guessing a man… middle-aged?

763
00:53:55,152 --> 00:53:59,615
A man waiting his whole life
to be noticed by a woman like you.

764
00:54:01,033 --> 00:54:02,242
An orphan.

765
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:06,955
Highly intelligent.
Inherently resourceful.

766
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:10,542
Growing up in poverty
left you longing for the finer things.

767
00:54:11,418 --> 00:54:13,045
Other people's things.

768
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:17,341
Someone saw your potential
and helped you hone your skills.

769
00:54:17,925 --> 00:54:20,511
Skills that gave you
the life you thought you wanted.

770
00:54:20,594 --> 00:54:24,056
Tailored clothes,
fine dining, luxury hotels.

771
00:54:24,139 --> 00:54:27,017
Skills that kept you
one step ahead of the law,

772
00:54:27,935 --> 00:54:29,269
until now.

773
00:54:31,188 --> 00:54:34,441
You can't blame a girl
for trying to make a dishonest living.

774
00:54:35,234 --> 00:54:39,821
You had no idea what you were stealing.
Otherwise you never would have stolen it.

775
00:54:41,615 --> 00:54:42,616
Tell you what.

776
00:54:42,699 --> 00:54:46,203
You get me out of here,
and I'll take you straight to the key.

777
00:54:46,286 --> 00:54:47,788
I have a better idea.

778
00:54:47,871 --> 00:54:49,456
You're gonna tell me everything.

779
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:51,583
Then I'll think about getting you
out of here.

780
00:54:51,667 --> 00:54:53,752
Now start with who hired you.

781
00:54:53,836 --> 00:54:56,880
And don't lie to me, because I'll know.

782
00:54:56,964 --> 00:54:58,715
I have no idea who hired me.

783
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:01,093
Contact with the client
was almost entirely electronic.

784
00:55:01,176 --> 00:55:02,219
-Email?
-Texts.

785
00:55:02,302 --> 00:55:03,554
-Encrypted?
-Naturally.

786
00:55:03,637 --> 00:55:04,888
-Almost?
-Pardon?

787
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:08,100
You said contact with the client
was "almost" entirely electronic.

788
00:55:08,183 --> 00:55:10,686
There was a dead drop in a café
in Luxembourg.

789
00:55:10,769 --> 00:55:12,521
-An envelope.
-What was in the envelope?

790
00:55:12,604 --> 00:55:14,690
A ticket to Abu Dhabi.

791
00:55:15,524 --> 00:55:17,234
And…

792
00:55:17,317 --> 00:55:20,320
a picture of you.

793
00:55:21,864 --> 00:55:23,949
My instructions
were to follow you at the airport.

794
00:55:24,032 --> 00:55:25,325
You'd be tailing a mark.

795
00:55:25,409 --> 00:55:28,620
Said mark would have a key
and four million in cryptocurrency.

796
00:55:28,704 --> 00:55:31,164
That drive was useless, by the way.
It was empty.

797
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:34,877
The only hope I have of getting paid
is to deliver your half of the key.

798
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,421
And you were instructed to deliver it to…

799
00:55:37,504 --> 00:55:38,422
Venice.

800
00:55:38,505 --> 00:55:41,133
Party at Ducale Palace.
Tomorrow. Midnight.

801
00:55:44,678 --> 00:55:45,888
You expecting someone?

802
00:55:45,971 --> 00:55:49,433
Your friends from the airport.
Saw them in the hallway a few minutes ago.

803
00:55:52,186 --> 00:55:54,271
You could have said something sooner.

804
00:55:54,354 --> 00:55:57,107
Well, they were chasing you, not me.

805
00:56:19,338 --> 00:56:21,131
A pervertito!

806
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:24,259
No, Grace.

807
00:56:26,637 --> 00:56:27,596
No, no, no.

808
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:29,806
She's my client.

809
00:56:32,351 --> 00:56:33,310
Grace.

810
00:56:38,482 --> 00:56:39,775
No, no.

811
00:57:12,391 --> 00:57:14,726
No, no! Move! Move!

812
00:57:17,813 --> 00:57:19,147
Sorry!

813
00:57:35,831 --> 00:57:37,124
Who parks like that?

814
00:57:55,601 --> 00:57:57,728
Grace! You gotta pull over.

815
00:57:58,395 --> 00:57:59,229
Grace.

816
00:57:59,313 --> 00:58:02,524
Pull over. Listen.
I'm trying to help you! Grace!

817
00:58:09,907 --> 00:58:11,033
Bring her to me.

818
00:58:41,313 --> 00:58:44,191
Are you okay? You okay? No, no, no.

819
00:58:44,274 --> 00:58:45,192
We're okay.

820
00:58:51,073 --> 00:58:52,449
Give me your hand.

821
00:58:52,533 --> 00:58:55,202
Slow, slow, slow. It's okay.

822
00:58:55,744 --> 00:58:57,120
Slow.

823
00:58:57,204 --> 00:58:59,748
Is anything broken?
Are you okay? You okay?

824
00:58:59,831 --> 00:59:00,749
Hunt!

825
00:59:01,542 --> 00:59:02,918
It's over!

826
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:05,295
Let the girl go.

827
00:59:05,379 --> 00:59:06,922
Put the bracelets on.

828
00:59:07,923 --> 00:59:11,301
There you go. Put them on. Do it!

829
00:59:11,385 --> 00:59:13,554
It's okay. He's not gonna shoot you.

830
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:18,100
Put your weapons down now.

831
00:59:19,476 --> 00:59:22,187
Special Operations.
He's wanted for terrorism.

832
00:59:23,188 --> 00:59:26,024
Goddamn it, Degas, get rid of those women.

833
00:59:26,108 --> 00:59:28,235
Hunt, listen to me. Listen to me.

834
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:30,320
Let her go and put them on.

835
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:32,906
Put your weapons down now.

836
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:33,949
It's all under control.

837
00:59:34,032 --> 00:59:36,910
It's okay! It's okay! It's okay!

838
00:59:40,163 --> 00:59:41,874
Everybody down! Get down!

839
00:59:47,337 --> 00:59:50,048
-Down, down!
-Cover, cover! Cover!

840
01:00:20,537 --> 01:00:22,623
-You're driving.
-What?

841
01:00:22,706 --> 01:00:24,166
No, no, no!

842
01:00:25,292 --> 01:00:26,668
Go, go, go. Hit the accelerator.

843
01:00:26,752 --> 01:00:28,086
Go, go, go!

844
01:00:37,804 --> 01:00:38,889
Go, go, go!

845
01:00:56,031 --> 01:00:57,366
Get in!

846
01:00:57,449 --> 01:00:59,117
You're good. Just keep it going.

847
01:00:59,201 --> 01:01:00,661
Don't stop.

848
01:01:10,754 --> 01:01:11,588
Car, car, car.

849
01:01:20,389 --> 01:01:23,433
It's okay. Just put your foot
on the brake. Start the car.

850
01:01:23,517 --> 01:01:24,768
Wait, wait, wait!

851
01:01:24,852 --> 01:01:27,354
-What's happening?
-I'm done. I'm not doing this.

852
01:01:27,437 --> 01:01:29,022
People are chasing us.

853
01:01:29,106 --> 01:01:32,359
Yes, they are. You're driving.
Now, come on.

854
01:02:03,515 --> 01:02:05,225
Who is that person?

855
01:02:05,309 --> 01:02:06,727
I have no idea.

856
01:02:11,607 --> 01:02:13,692
-You okay?
-I will be when this is over.

857
01:02:16,403 --> 01:02:17,821
Oh, man.

858
01:02:22,117 --> 01:02:23,577
It's okay. It's okay.

859
01:02:36,173 --> 01:02:37,591
Is there anyone not chasing us?

860
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:39,551
We gotta get rid of this car.

861
01:02:42,429 --> 01:02:44,306
Scooters! Damn it.

862
01:03:05,536 --> 01:03:07,412
What are we doing?

863
01:03:09,581 --> 01:03:10,791
Finding us a new car.

864
01:03:32,354 --> 01:03:33,689
Okay.

865
01:03:50,789 --> 01:03:52,541
-Just give me a second.
-Yeah.

866
01:03:52,624 --> 01:03:54,251
-Thanks. Okay?
-Yeah.

867
01:03:54,334 --> 01:03:56,003
-You ready?
-I'm ready.

868
01:03:59,631 --> 01:04:01,175
-Wow.
-You okay?

869
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:04,469
Yeah, look, I'm sorry. This is…

870
01:04:04,553 --> 01:04:06,555
-It's okay.
-No, this car, the way they…

871
01:04:06,638 --> 01:04:07,472
It's okay.

872
01:04:07,556 --> 01:04:09,433
No, the way they set them up,
sometimes it's just…

873
01:04:09,516 --> 01:04:11,351
-Let's go.
-It takes me…

874
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:23,780
Traffic cameras have picked up the woman
on facial recognition.

875
01:04:23,864 --> 01:04:25,741
She is now in a yellow Fiat 500.

876
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:27,743
Units are in pursuit.

877
01:04:42,382 --> 01:04:44,927
Now I got you.

878
01:04:53,727 --> 01:04:54,937
Looks like we lost them.

879
01:05:20,963 --> 01:05:22,047
Let's just--

880
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:23,006
Move, move, move!

881
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,984
Baby, baby, baby!

882
01:05:54,872 --> 01:05:56,164
Wait, what?

883
01:05:56,957 --> 01:05:57,916
No, no, no.

884
01:06:04,006 --> 01:06:05,048
Go, go, go!

885
01:06:08,552 --> 01:06:09,428
Go straight.

886
01:06:17,352 --> 01:06:19,980
-Just take your foot off the accelerator.
-We're on fire. We're on fire!

887
01:06:20,063 --> 01:06:21,899
It's the tires. Just try to go straight.

888
01:06:24,026 --> 01:06:25,611
-Hang on.
-Why is it spinning?

889
01:06:27,613 --> 01:06:28,947
Good, good, good!

890
01:06:31,366 --> 01:06:32,951
I've got it, I've got it, I've got it.

891
01:06:34,369 --> 01:06:36,830
-Turn right. Down there. Right there!
-Come on!

892
01:06:45,589 --> 01:06:46,840
Got to go right. Turn right!

893
01:06:49,635 --> 01:06:51,887
-Who's driving?
-You're driving.

894
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:53,597
Go, go, go. Just go straight.

895
01:06:54,556 --> 01:06:55,557
Go, go, go.

896
01:06:55,641 --> 01:06:58,060
Just keep going straight.

897
01:06:58,143 --> 01:07:01,563
Or left. Go, go, go. You're doing good.

898
01:07:07,444 --> 01:07:08,946
Cops! A lot of cops!

899
01:07:10,239 --> 01:07:11,740
Take the wheel.

900
01:07:11,823 --> 01:07:13,408
Brake, brake, brake.

901
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:20,582
Okay, your wheel.

902
01:07:22,501 --> 01:07:23,794
Straight?

903
01:07:23,877 --> 01:07:25,420
-Right, right, right.
-Got it.

904
01:07:34,137 --> 01:07:35,848
-Which way now?
-Left, left, left.

905
01:07:44,356 --> 01:07:45,983
Okay. You're good, you're good.

906
01:07:50,863 --> 01:07:52,072
That's a person.

907
01:07:54,741 --> 01:07:56,618
-Car, car.
-I see it!

908
01:08:23,187 --> 01:08:24,020
Hit it.

909
01:08:31,737 --> 01:08:32,904
Hang on!

910
01:08:44,582 --> 01:08:47,419
-What is happening? Where are we going?
-I don't know.

911
01:08:48,462 --> 01:08:50,130
Okay, brake, brake, brake!

912
01:09:19,826 --> 01:09:21,161
Don't hate me.

913
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:25,916
Grace? Grace!

914
01:09:41,473 --> 01:09:42,640
Come on, come on.

915
01:10:11,003 --> 01:10:12,087
Ethan!

916
01:10:12,754 --> 01:10:13,839
Ethan!

917
01:10:17,467 --> 01:10:19,386
Well, come on.

918
01:11:14,441 --> 01:11:17,069
All right. We know Grace
has one half of the key.

919
01:11:17,152 --> 01:11:19,613
We also know she's gonna be
at the Ducale at midnight.

920
01:11:19,696 --> 01:11:23,325
And now we have a pretty good idea
as to who will be waiting for her there.

921
01:11:23,408 --> 01:11:25,077
The event is being hosted
by none other than

922
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:29,289
our favorite international arms trafficker
and black marketeer, Alana Mitsopolis.

923
01:11:29,373 --> 01:11:31,208
The White Widow.

924
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:34,378
Does she know who you actually are
or does she still think

925
01:11:34,461 --> 01:11:37,297
you're the globally notorious
mass murderer John Lark?

926
01:11:37,381 --> 01:11:39,132
Who says I'm not?

927
01:11:39,216 --> 01:11:41,510
Didn't she put a price
on your head in Paris?

928
01:11:41,593 --> 01:11:45,722
She did indeed.
She and Ethan, they worked it out.

929
01:11:46,306 --> 01:11:47,975
You never did tell me how.

930
01:11:48,058 --> 01:11:49,726
Can we continue, please?

931
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:50,769
Right.

932
01:11:50,853 --> 01:11:53,438
Assuming we get the complete key
at the party tonight,

933
01:11:53,522 --> 01:11:56,733
we still don't know what it unlocks,
so we need to find somebody who does.

934
01:11:56,817 --> 01:11:59,570
The question is where to start looking.

935
01:11:59,653 --> 01:12:02,447
We figured that the bomb didn't
just walk into the airport by itself.

936
01:12:02,531 --> 01:12:03,907
Right? Somebody put it there.

937
01:12:03,991 --> 01:12:06,577
Somebody working for the Entity.

938
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:10,163
This is everything I captured from
the security cameras at the airport

939
01:12:10,247 --> 01:12:12,541
up to the minute everything went haywire.

940
01:12:12,624 --> 01:12:15,836
And this is the feed
from your AR sunglasses.

941
01:12:15,919 --> 01:12:18,922
I've been running facial recognition
on everyone in the airport.

942
01:12:19,006 --> 01:12:20,257
See anything strange?

943
01:12:23,594 --> 01:12:24,970
It's like a ghost.

944
01:12:25,053 --> 01:12:26,722
Ghosts don't have reflections.

945
01:12:30,434 --> 01:12:34,479
The only person in the airport
with no identity.

946
01:12:34,563 --> 01:12:38,817
The only man who can't be found
anyplace else in the airport

947
01:12:38,901 --> 01:12:41,695
except that reflection.

948
01:12:42,279 --> 01:12:43,989
He's being erased.

949
01:12:44,531 --> 01:12:46,074
In real time.

950
01:12:52,748 --> 01:12:54,041
The Entity.

951
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:56,710
It's protecting him.

952
01:12:57,294 --> 01:12:59,296
You saw him, didn't you?

953
01:13:01,757 --> 01:13:03,133
I wasn't sure.

954
01:13:04,635 --> 01:13:05,886
Well, who is he?

955
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:15,103
Someone I thought

956
01:13:16,313 --> 01:13:18,065
died a long time ago.

957
01:13:18,148 --> 01:13:19,816
In another life.

958
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,902
Before the IMF.

959
01:13:22,945 --> 01:13:25,948
Before I was offered the choice.

960
01:13:29,076 --> 01:13:30,619
And in a very real sense,

961
01:13:31,453 --> 01:13:34,164
he made me who I am today.

962
01:13:35,374 --> 01:13:37,167
Does he have a name?

963
01:13:37,251 --> 01:13:39,711
He calls himself Gabriel.

964
01:13:42,673 --> 01:13:44,132
You know him.

965
01:13:46,385 --> 01:13:48,262
There is no knowing him.

966
01:13:49,304 --> 01:13:51,765
He has no recorded past.

967
01:13:51,849 --> 01:13:53,851
The Entity made sure of that.

968
01:13:54,768 --> 01:13:56,186
He's a dark messiah.

969
01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:59,314
The Entity's chosen messenger.

970
01:13:59,398 --> 01:14:00,858
And he sees death

971
01:14:01,942 --> 01:14:05,612
as a gift he wants to share
with the rest of the world.

972
01:14:06,196 --> 01:14:07,197
How do you know this?

973
01:14:07,281 --> 01:14:11,034
I still have a few friends left in MI6.

974
01:14:11,118 --> 01:14:15,539
Friends who are afraid of the British
government gaining control of the Entity.

975
01:14:16,373 --> 01:14:19,960
Any attempt to try to stop them
would be seen as an act of treason.

976
01:14:20,043 --> 01:14:21,545
And because you're disavowed,

977
01:14:21,628 --> 01:14:25,299
your friends called
and asked you for help.

978
01:14:25,382 --> 01:14:28,218
They knew Gabriel serves the Entity.

979
01:14:28,302 --> 01:14:30,137
They knew he was on his way to Istanbul

980
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:33,932
to acquire one half of a cruciform key.

981
01:14:35,142 --> 01:14:37,895
So I beat him to it.

982
01:14:39,313 --> 01:14:41,398
And when Kittridge
put a bounty on your head,

983
01:14:42,399 --> 01:14:44,443
you went to the desert to hide.

984
01:14:44,526 --> 01:14:47,279
But somehow the bounty hunters
found you anyway.

985
01:14:47,362 --> 01:14:48,405
Yes.

986
01:14:48,488 --> 01:14:52,910
So, did these friends of yours
happen to say what the key unlocks?

987
01:14:52,993 --> 01:14:57,289
MI6 suspects it leads somehow
to the Entity's source code.

988
01:14:57,372 --> 01:14:58,790
Source code.

989
01:14:59,666 --> 01:15:01,043
When were you gonna tell me this?

990
01:15:02,294 --> 01:15:03,504
I'm telling you now.

991
01:15:05,255 --> 01:15:07,674
Your friends at MI6,
how'd they contact you?

992
01:15:07,758 --> 01:15:09,635
Did you speak with them? Face to face?

993
01:15:09,718 --> 01:15:11,261
I'm disavowed.

994
01:15:11,345 --> 01:15:15,057
They couldn't risk meeting me in person,
so all communication--

995
01:15:17,226 --> 01:15:20,187
Was electronic. Was digital.

996
01:15:23,941 --> 01:15:25,901
No. We can't be sure that was the Entity.

997
01:15:25,984 --> 01:15:27,861
We can't be sure it wasn't.

998
01:15:27,945 --> 01:15:31,323
We can't be sure anything is real
outside of this very conversation.

999
01:15:33,075 --> 01:15:34,117
None of you should be here.

1000
01:15:34,201 --> 01:15:36,662
-Ethan--
-No. You don't know Gabriel. I do.

1001
01:15:36,745 --> 01:15:38,622
It's not the killing he enjoys.

1002
01:15:38,705 --> 01:15:40,624
It's the suffering it causes.

1003
01:15:40,707 --> 01:15:42,709
And he knows the best way to get to me

1004
01:15:43,335 --> 01:15:45,045
is through all of you.

1005
01:15:46,213 --> 01:15:47,923
And if Gabriel knows me…

1006
01:15:48,006 --> 01:15:49,591
The Entity knows.

1007
01:15:49,675 --> 01:15:52,553
There's a reason he wants me here.
There's…

1008
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:56,473
There's a reason he wants you here.
It wants you here.

1009
01:15:56,557 --> 01:16:00,143
"Who or what is
the most important thing to you?"

1010
01:16:01,103 --> 01:16:03,313
No. You have to go. You all have to go.

1011
01:16:03,397 --> 01:16:06,275
-Ethan, what if it wants us to leave?
-Like you made us leave the airport.

1012
01:16:06,358 --> 01:16:08,861
What if it wants you alone
at that party tonight?

1013
01:16:08,944 --> 01:16:11,071
Then I go alone. At least I don't have
all of you to worry about.

1014
01:16:11,154 --> 01:16:13,365
This is exactly why
I didn't want to tell you.

1015
01:16:13,448 --> 01:16:16,910
Ethan, you're playing
four-dimensional chess with an algorithm.

1016
01:16:16,994 --> 01:16:18,495
The Entity knows who we are.

1017
01:16:18,579 --> 01:16:21,373
Any move we make,
it's probably considered it.

1018
01:16:21,456 --> 01:16:24,376
Anything we do, we have to assume
that it's counting on us to do it.

1019
01:16:24,459 --> 01:16:28,463
If you want to beat this thing,
you have to start thinking like it.

1020
01:16:28,547 --> 01:16:31,925
Cold, logical, unemotional.

1021
01:16:32,009 --> 01:16:35,429
If that key really does
grant control of the Entity,

1022
01:16:35,512 --> 01:16:38,891
Gabriel is the last person on Earth
who should have it.

1023
01:16:38,974 --> 01:16:40,434
She's right, Ethan.

1024
01:16:40,517 --> 01:16:43,604
Gabriel cannot have that key.

1025
01:16:43,687 --> 01:16:47,608
And none of our lives
can matter more than this mission.

1026
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:55,991
I don't accept that.

1027
01:17:22,226 --> 01:17:24,311
It's my first time in Venice.

1028
01:17:28,315 --> 01:17:29,775
It's mine, too.

1029
01:18:31,378 --> 01:18:32,754
Buy you a drink?

1030
01:18:33,589 --> 01:18:35,299
I'm waiting for someone.

1031
01:18:35,382 --> 01:18:36,258
So am I.

1032
01:18:38,594 --> 01:18:41,471
We can wait together. I'm Gabriel.

1033
01:18:41,555 --> 01:18:43,223
If you say so.

1034
01:18:44,016 --> 01:18:45,434
And you're Grace.

1035
01:18:54,985 --> 01:18:56,195
I don't have it on me.

1036
01:18:56,278 --> 01:18:58,530
I wouldn't expect you to.

1037
01:18:58,614 --> 01:19:00,449
In any case, I'm not here for the key.

1038
01:19:01,575 --> 01:19:02,618
What do you want?

1039
01:19:02,701 --> 01:19:05,412
Suppose while we're waiting
I tell you a little story.

1040
01:19:05,495 --> 01:19:07,998
You're obviously not the person
I came here to meet.

1041
01:19:08,081 --> 01:19:09,833
It's your story, Grace.

1042
01:19:11,001 --> 01:19:12,836
I know how it ends.

1043
01:19:14,004 --> 01:19:16,632
Let me buy you a drink
and perhaps we can change it.

1044
01:19:44,493 --> 01:19:46,078
Let's go to a party.

1045
01:19:53,919 --> 01:19:55,462
Excuse me, sir.

1046
01:19:57,256 --> 01:19:59,007
Would you please follow me?

1047
01:20:00,592 --> 01:20:04,346
It's important you understand
that you're not unique.

1048
01:20:05,013 --> 01:20:06,098
Thirty years ago…

1049
01:20:07,099 --> 01:20:08,392
her name was Marie.

1050
01:20:09,017 --> 01:20:12,104
The first of many women
who trusted our mutual friend.

1051
01:20:12,187 --> 01:20:14,731
Women who all have something he wants.

1052
01:20:15,315 --> 01:20:19,111
Women who are all in over their heads,
or so he tells them.

1053
01:20:19,862 --> 01:20:21,488
Sound familiar?

1054
01:20:21,572 --> 01:20:23,490
What happened to Marie?

1055
01:20:23,574 --> 01:20:26,326
Same thing that happens
to all the women he uses,

1056
01:20:27,202 --> 01:20:29,872
as well as anyone else
who touches that key.

1057
01:20:29,955 --> 01:20:32,416
He doesn't care
whether people live or die.

1058
01:20:32,499 --> 01:20:35,878
He cares only about his objective.

1059
01:20:36,712 --> 01:20:38,672
And right now,
the only thing standing in his way

1060
01:20:39,464 --> 01:20:40,591
is you.

1061
01:20:41,675 --> 01:20:44,136
-Why should I believe you?
-You shouldn't.

1062
01:20:44,219 --> 01:20:46,805
You've stepped
into a world of lies, Grace.

1063
01:20:46,889 --> 01:20:48,056
Nothing anyone says is true.

1064
01:20:48,974 --> 01:20:52,144
Just remember that
when he promises to protect you.

1065
01:20:52,227 --> 01:20:53,270
Grace.

1066
01:21:07,659 --> 01:21:09,953
It's been a long time, Ethan.

1067
01:21:10,537 --> 01:21:12,664
You should've killed me
when you had the chance.

1068
01:21:13,999 --> 01:21:16,627
Good evening, everyone.

1069
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:19,338
If it isn't John Lark.

1070
01:21:20,339 --> 01:21:22,466
Except it isn't, actually.

1071
01:21:23,008 --> 01:21:25,260
But until you're ready
to tell me your real name,

1072
01:21:25,344 --> 01:21:27,804
Lark will have to do.

1073
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:30,432
It's good to see you, Alana.

1074
01:21:34,102 --> 01:21:37,189
And you're Gabriel, I presume.

1075
01:21:37,272 --> 01:21:40,234
I've heard so very little about you.

1076
01:21:40,317 --> 01:21:43,570
Aren't you so much more
handsome in person?

1077
01:21:46,281 --> 01:21:48,575
Such a gentleman, too.

1078
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:55,499
And you must be Grace.

1079
01:21:58,377 --> 01:22:00,671
Should I know you?

1080
01:22:00,754 --> 01:22:03,423
I believe you have something for me.

1081
01:22:03,507 --> 01:22:05,342
You hired me.

1082
01:22:05,425 --> 01:22:07,594
Oh, I handpicked you.

1083
01:22:18,021 --> 01:22:18,981
Don't!

1084
01:22:20,774 --> 01:22:21,733
You don't.

1085
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,464
She doesn't have it.

1086
01:22:45,215 --> 01:22:46,675
Where is it?

1087
01:22:46,758 --> 01:22:49,386
It's in the last place
you would ever think to look.

1088
01:22:52,347 --> 01:22:54,516
Why don't we go upstairs and have a drink?

1089
01:22:58,687 --> 01:22:59,771
Where are you going?

1090
01:23:00,355 --> 01:23:02,274
This is a private party.
You can't come in.

1091
01:23:13,619 --> 01:23:14,703
Damn.

1092
01:23:14,786 --> 01:23:17,831
As most of you know, I am merely a broker.

1093
01:23:17,915 --> 01:23:19,625
I connect a buyer and a seller.

1094
01:23:19,708 --> 01:23:22,419
Sometimes for money,
sometimes for information,

1095
01:23:22,503 --> 01:23:25,923
but mostly for friendship.

1096
01:23:26,632 --> 01:23:29,426
I just want everyone to get along.

1097
01:23:30,219 --> 01:23:32,721
With me, especially.

1098
01:23:32,804 --> 01:23:35,891
But the world is changing.

1099
01:23:35,974 --> 01:23:37,768
Truth is vanishing.

1100
01:23:37,851 --> 01:23:39,895
War is coming.

1101
01:23:39,978 --> 01:23:44,816
And the key to world domination
is, of all things, a key.

1102
01:23:45,651 --> 01:23:48,654
One with the power to control the Entity.

1103
01:23:49,321 --> 01:23:51,031
One that any government in the world

1104
01:23:51,114 --> 01:23:54,576
would pay a king's ransom
to take possession of.

1105
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:56,453
And some of my dearest friends--

1106
01:23:56,537 --> 01:24:00,123
in this case, every major nuclear power
and a handful of minor ones--

1107
01:24:00,207 --> 01:24:02,209
have asked me to deliver this key.

1108
01:24:02,292 --> 01:24:04,586
Of course, if you do find the key,

1109
01:24:04,670 --> 01:24:07,256
you'll be forced to confront
an impossible dilemma.

1110
01:24:07,339 --> 01:24:10,467
Whoever you give the key to
will be forever in your debt.

1111
01:24:10,551 --> 01:24:13,971
But to the rest of the world,
you'll be an enemy.

1112
01:24:14,555 --> 01:24:15,722
Oh, I like her!

1113
01:24:15,806 --> 01:24:18,684
What's your relationship with him?

1114
01:24:18,767 --> 01:24:21,478
Gabriel represents
another interested party.

1115
01:24:22,062 --> 01:24:24,523
In fact, this party

1116
01:24:24,606 --> 01:24:28,360
was arranged by that interested party.

1117
01:24:28,443 --> 01:24:32,573
You could even say that this party
is that interested party.

1118
01:25:05,731 --> 01:25:07,316
Is this…

1119
01:25:08,442 --> 01:25:09,693
The Entity.

1120
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:13,989
And so the plot thickens.

1121
01:25:14,781 --> 01:25:16,992
Do I give the key
to one of my old friends,

1122
01:25:17,075 --> 01:25:20,579
or do I hand it and my fate
over to Gabriel

1123
01:25:20,662 --> 01:25:23,624
and his infernal machine?

1124
01:25:25,292 --> 01:25:28,462
What makes you so sure
you'll get the completed key?

1125
01:25:30,047 --> 01:25:31,381
You have one half of it.

1126
01:25:31,965 --> 01:25:35,719
And she knows where the other half is.

1127
01:25:38,388 --> 01:25:40,682
Assuming you can get it,

1128
01:25:41,683 --> 01:25:45,145
why don't you just keep the key
and all that power for yourself?

1129
01:25:45,229 --> 01:25:47,940
Because she doesn't know what it unlocks

1130
01:25:48,023 --> 01:25:49,942
any more than the rest of us.

1131
01:25:50,984 --> 01:25:53,362
So, like it or not,
you have to choose a suitor.

1132
01:25:53,445 --> 01:25:57,407
It's distastefully put, Lark,
but it's true.

1133
01:25:57,491 --> 01:26:00,702
Of course I know what it unlocks.

1134
01:26:01,453 --> 01:26:03,830
And what's he offering for the key?

1135
01:26:03,914 --> 01:26:07,334
As I've explained to Grace before,
I'm not here for any key,

1136
01:26:07,417 --> 01:26:09,878
as I'll have both halves in hand tomorrow.

1137
01:26:10,546 --> 01:26:12,214
What makes you so certain of that?

1138
01:26:12,297 --> 01:26:15,133
You've no idea of the power I represent.

1139
01:26:15,217 --> 01:26:18,762
Thousands of quadrillions of computations
per millisecond

1140
01:26:18,846 --> 01:26:22,391
subtly manipulating the minds of billions

1141
01:26:22,474 --> 01:26:25,269
while parsing
every possible cause and effect,

1142
01:26:25,352 --> 01:26:28,105
every scenario, however implausible,

1143
01:26:28,188 --> 01:26:32,568
into a very real map
of a most probable next.

1144
01:26:32,651 --> 01:26:35,612
And with only a few changes
to the present,

1145
01:26:35,696 --> 01:26:38,615
the future is all but assured.

1146
01:26:39,658 --> 01:26:41,702
The key will come to me.

1147
01:26:42,411 --> 01:26:43,287
Tomorrow.

1148
01:26:44,329 --> 01:26:47,249
On the Orient Express bound for Innsbruck.

1149
01:26:47,332 --> 01:26:48,709
Innsbruck?

1150
01:26:48,792 --> 01:26:50,127
It knows.

1151
01:26:50,210 --> 01:26:53,338
It knows that you've already
chosen your suitor.

1152
01:26:53,422 --> 01:26:56,717
It knows that you intend to mate
the two halves of the key

1153
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,552
in a desperate grasp for control.

1154
01:26:59,511 --> 01:27:02,347
I, however, have been promised
the completed key

1155
01:27:02,431 --> 01:27:04,433
will lay itself at my feet,

1156
01:27:05,142 --> 01:27:08,020
provided someone dies tonight.

1157
01:27:09,396 --> 01:27:10,480
Who?

1158
01:27:11,398 --> 01:27:12,232
Her.

1159
01:27:14,151 --> 01:27:15,152
Or her.

1160
01:27:17,696 --> 01:27:19,823
And you will bear witness, Ethan.

1161
01:27:19,907 --> 01:27:23,952
The key will be mine, and I will be gone,

1162
01:27:24,036 --> 01:27:26,455
like smoke in a hurricane.

1163
01:27:26,538 --> 01:27:29,458
But only after someone
you care about dies.

1164
01:27:31,585 --> 01:27:32,920
It is written.

1165
01:27:34,630 --> 01:27:36,298
You see what this is,

1166
01:27:37,132 --> 01:27:38,050
don't you?

1167
01:27:39,676 --> 01:27:41,261
He's afraid.

1168
01:27:42,012 --> 01:27:43,597
It's afraid.

1169
01:27:44,431 --> 01:27:46,975
Somehow it knows we're close.

1170
01:27:47,518 --> 01:27:48,852
Why else would you be here?

1171
01:27:49,686 --> 01:27:53,607
Help me. Help me complete the key,
and I will kill this thing.

1172
01:27:53,690 --> 01:27:55,400
It knows your every secret, Alana.

1173
01:27:55,484 --> 01:27:57,319
Don't listen to this fanatic.

1174
01:27:57,402 --> 01:27:58,820
Help him and you'll die, too.

1175
01:27:58,904 --> 01:28:00,989
Help him, everyone dies.

1176
01:28:01,073 --> 01:28:03,033
I'll see you tomorrow.

1177
01:28:04,284 --> 01:28:05,536
Alana?

1178
01:28:13,377 --> 01:28:15,379
His fate is written.

1179
01:28:15,462 --> 01:28:17,047
Shall we write yours, too?

1180
01:28:18,715 --> 01:28:19,716
Alana.

1181
01:28:22,928 --> 01:28:25,472
I'm sorry, Lark.

1182
01:28:36,525 --> 01:28:39,111
For old times' sake,
I'll let you choose which one.

1183
01:28:40,362 --> 01:28:41,196
Ilsa…

1184
01:28:42,114 --> 01:28:43,323
or Grace.

1185
01:28:43,407 --> 01:28:46,743
Kill him, Zola. Kill him.
Kill him where he stands!

1186
01:28:46,827 --> 01:28:48,704
The choice is yours then, Alana.

1187
01:28:48,787 --> 01:28:51,665
Though I'll remind you,
Grace knows where half the key is.

1188
01:28:53,125 --> 01:28:56,295
If anything happens to either of them,

1189
01:28:56,378 --> 01:29:00,549
there is no place on Earth where you
or your god will be safe from me.

1190
01:29:00,632 --> 01:29:04,553
There's no place that I won't go
to kill you. That is written.

1191
01:29:04,636 --> 01:29:06,555
It's good to see you, old friend.

1192
01:29:12,644 --> 01:29:13,687
See you soon.

1193
01:29:39,171 --> 01:29:42,257
You have made a terrible mistake.

1194
01:29:42,341 --> 01:29:44,551
My life is on the line here.

1195
01:29:45,135 --> 01:29:47,513
I have to be on that train tomorrow.

1196
01:29:48,597 --> 01:29:50,849
And I have to have that key.

1197
01:29:52,142 --> 01:29:55,437
And I do not care how I get it.

1198
01:29:59,483 --> 01:30:00,317
Don't move.

1199
01:30:06,281 --> 01:30:07,449
Run as far as you can.

1200
01:30:47,865 --> 01:30:48,782
What the f--

1201
01:31:52,971 --> 01:31:54,264
Grace! Grace!

1202
01:31:55,432 --> 01:31:56,266
Grace!

1203
01:32:11,532 --> 01:32:13,909
Luther, Benji,
if you hear me, I need eyes.

1204
01:32:13,992 --> 01:32:16,245
Grace is leaving the Ducale on foot.
She has the key.

1205
01:32:16,328 --> 01:32:18,914
-We're here. Go.
-Need to find her. Where is she?

1206
01:32:19,456 --> 01:32:21,500
Damn it! I've lost picture.
I need another satellite.

1207
01:32:21,583 --> 01:32:23,752
Hacking the Russian Zenith 4
spy satellite.

1208
01:32:23,836 --> 01:32:25,921
We're scraping the barrel,
but it'll have to do.

1209
01:32:34,638 --> 01:32:35,764
This way!

1210
01:32:55,033 --> 01:32:57,494
Where am I going? Come on, come on.

1211
01:32:57,578 --> 01:32:59,580
-Stand by.
-Just hurry.

1212
01:32:59,663 --> 01:33:01,206
She's just north of you,
crossing the bridge.

1213
01:33:01,290 --> 01:33:02,207
Say again, Benji.

1214
01:33:02,291 --> 01:33:04,293
Just head north.
She's crossing the bridge.

1215
01:33:22,227 --> 01:33:24,146
Ethan, take the passage to your right.

1216
01:33:24,229 --> 01:33:27,274
-Yeah, I see it!
-Down that narrow alley and turn left.

1217
01:33:27,357 --> 01:33:29,484
-I'm losing picture again.
-Looking for another.

1218
01:33:30,068 --> 01:33:33,405
The Entity is knocking out satellites
faster than I can hack into them.

1219
01:33:58,889 --> 01:34:00,682
Benji, I don't see her. Where is she?

1220
01:34:00,766 --> 01:34:03,018
-Down the narrow alley and turn left.
-Okay, copy that.

1221
01:34:04,353 --> 01:34:05,187
Turn right.

1222
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:07,898
Sorry, my mistake.
I meant left. Another left.

1223
01:34:07,981 --> 01:34:09,441
Oh, my God.

1224
01:34:09,525 --> 01:34:12,236
Ethan, our comms have been breached!
You're talking to the Entity!

1225
01:34:12,778 --> 01:34:15,948
Turn left. Turn right.
Take the bridge to your left.

1226
01:34:16,031 --> 01:34:17,991
Ethan, that is not me! Do you copy?

1227
01:34:18,075 --> 01:34:18,909
Ethan, come in.

1228
01:34:18,992 --> 01:34:21,787
Down the alley to your left. Turn left.

1229
01:34:21,870 --> 01:34:23,288
Turn right.

1230
01:34:24,998 --> 01:34:26,166
Try to reestablish comms.

1231
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:28,085
-Wait, where are you going?
-To try and find Ethan.

1232
01:34:28,168 --> 01:34:30,337
Go to the end of the alley and turn right.

1233
01:34:30,420 --> 01:34:34,049
Ethan, I see Grace about 800 meters
in front of you. Take that passage.

1234
01:34:43,517 --> 01:34:44,560
Wait! Not that way!

1235
01:34:44,643 --> 01:34:45,477
What, why?

1236
01:34:46,061 --> 01:34:47,813
Which way?

1237
01:34:47,896 --> 01:34:49,106
Left or right?

1238
01:34:49,189 --> 01:34:50,816
It doesn't matter.

1239
01:34:50,899 --> 01:34:53,360
What do you mean, it doesn't matter?
Where is she?

1240
01:34:53,443 --> 01:34:55,696
She's on her way to the Minich Bridge

1241
01:34:57,531 --> 01:34:59,741
where Gabriel is waiting.

1242
01:35:00,325 --> 01:35:02,536
You will never get there in time.

1243
01:35:03,370 --> 01:35:05,163
But you can, Ilsa.

1244
01:35:06,373 --> 01:35:09,459
I know what matters most to you, Ethan.

1245
01:35:09,543 --> 01:35:11,086
This isn't Benji.

1246
01:35:11,170 --> 01:35:12,754
No, it's not.

1247
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:15,382
But you are done.

1248
01:35:38,655 --> 01:35:39,781
So be it.

1249
01:38:16,146 --> 01:38:18,065
I was hoping it'd be you.

1250
01:41:48,317 --> 01:41:49,735
I'm sorry.

1251
01:41:50,903 --> 01:41:52,571
I've forgotten your name.

1252
01:41:52,654 --> 01:41:53,488
Luther.

1253
01:41:55,574 --> 01:41:56,408
Benji.

1254
01:41:58,368 --> 01:41:59,328
And her?

1255
01:42:00,454 --> 01:42:01,622
Ilsa.

1256
01:42:03,332 --> 01:42:04,708
Were you close?

1257
01:42:05,542 --> 01:42:06,877
You and she?

1258
01:42:07,419 --> 01:42:08,962
In our way.

1259
01:42:11,632 --> 01:42:13,175
I'm the reason she's dead.

1260
01:42:13,258 --> 01:42:14,134
No.

1261
01:42:14,218 --> 01:42:16,553
She's the reason you're alive.

1262
01:42:16,637 --> 01:42:18,639
And that's the truth.

1263
01:42:18,722 --> 01:42:20,724
I don't know how to feel about it.

1264
01:42:20,807 --> 01:42:22,392
You probably never will.

1265
01:42:24,228 --> 01:42:25,604
I'm so sorry.

1266
01:42:27,314 --> 01:42:29,858
If there's anything I can do to help…

1267
01:42:29,942 --> 01:42:31,735
That's what we'd like
to talk to you about.

1268
01:42:33,779 --> 01:42:36,365
In a little over three hours,

1269
01:42:36,448 --> 01:42:41,161
the White Widow is expected to be
on the Orient Express to Innsbruck

1270
01:42:41,245 --> 01:42:45,249
where a buyer is waiting to take receipt
of the complete and verified key.

1271
01:42:45,332 --> 01:42:47,459
But she doesn't have the complete key.

1272
01:42:47,543 --> 01:42:49,086
That Widow doesn't.

1273
01:42:51,129 --> 01:42:52,506
But ours could.

1274
01:42:52,589 --> 01:42:55,008
What is that?

1275
01:42:55,884 --> 01:42:58,220
Your chance to be someone else.

1276
01:42:58,303 --> 01:42:59,221
I don't understand.

1277
01:42:59,304 --> 01:43:01,974
We're not gonna lie to you, Grace.
You're in a lot of trouble.

1278
01:43:02,057 --> 01:43:04,726
No number of fake passports
is gonna get you out of this one.

1279
01:43:04,810 --> 01:43:06,311
Governments know who you are.

1280
01:43:06,395 --> 01:43:07,813
The White Widow knows.

1281
01:43:07,896 --> 01:43:09,314
And the Entity knows.

1282
01:43:09,398 --> 01:43:12,693
Your future boils down
to three options now.

1283
01:43:12,776 --> 01:43:13,777
Prison.

1284
01:43:13,861 --> 01:43:15,153
Death.

1285
01:43:15,237 --> 01:43:16,572
Or the choice.

1286
01:43:16,655 --> 01:43:18,615
The choice?

1287
01:43:18,699 --> 01:43:20,033
At one time or another,

1288
01:43:20,117 --> 01:43:23,161
each of us was
in a similar situation to yours.

1289
01:43:23,245 --> 01:43:25,789
And each of us was offered the choice.

1290
01:43:25,873 --> 01:43:29,168
-The same choice we're offering you now.
-Which is?

1291
01:43:30,127 --> 01:43:31,587
To come with us.

1292
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:34,548
And be a ghost.

1293
01:45:10,185 --> 01:45:12,271
Wait, wait. Stop, stop.

1294
01:45:13,438 --> 01:45:14,439
You're not serious.

1295
01:45:14,523 --> 01:45:17,484
Well, you did say
you'd do anything to help.

1296
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:21,572
And you jump off the train with the key?

1297
01:45:21,655 --> 01:45:22,489
Yes.

1298
01:45:22,573 --> 01:45:24,116
You.

1299
01:45:24,199 --> 01:45:26,285
-Not us.
-Yes.

1300
01:45:26,994 --> 01:45:28,370
And what happens to me?

1301
01:45:28,453 --> 01:45:31,498
You'll be taken into custody
by Clandestine Services,

1302
01:45:31,582 --> 01:45:35,460
most likely the same men that have been
chasing me since Abu Dhabi.

1303
01:45:35,544 --> 01:45:38,172
Shortly thereafter,
a man will come to see you.

1304
01:45:38,255 --> 01:45:40,132
His name is Eugene Kittridge.

1305
01:45:40,215 --> 01:45:43,302
You'll tell him I sent you,
that I gave you the choice,

1306
01:45:44,136 --> 01:45:46,096
and that you choose to accept.

1307
01:45:47,931 --> 01:45:51,018
And you trust this Kittridge person?

1308
01:45:51,685 --> 01:45:53,854
I trust him to recognize your value.

1309
01:45:55,272 --> 01:45:56,523
He'll want to use you.

1310
01:45:57,566 --> 01:46:00,611
And after that, it's what?

1311
01:46:00,694 --> 01:46:02,029
This?

1312
01:46:02,905 --> 01:46:04,281
When do I get my life back?

1313
01:46:04,364 --> 01:46:05,908
What life?

1314
01:46:06,533 --> 01:46:08,827
I mean it, Grace. What life?

1315
01:46:08,911 --> 01:46:12,080
I lived that life. We all did.

1316
01:46:12,789 --> 01:46:15,501
Nobody's making us do this, Grace.

1317
01:46:15,584 --> 01:46:17,169
We're here because we want to be.

1318
01:46:18,378 --> 01:46:20,255
I tell you what, I'll give you a one-off.

1319
01:46:20,339 --> 01:46:22,132
I'll help you find the key
and your friends,

1320
01:46:22,216 --> 01:46:23,175
wipe my slate clean.

1321
01:46:23,258 --> 01:46:25,302
New name,
little bit of walking-around money--

1322
01:46:25,385 --> 01:46:26,345
You'll be dead.

1323
01:46:26,428 --> 01:46:31,266
Without a team, your life won't be
measured in years or even months.

1324
01:46:31,350 --> 01:46:33,810
It'll be measured in hours.

1325
01:46:33,894 --> 01:46:37,022
But if I stay, I'll be safe.

1326
01:46:37,814 --> 01:46:39,816
You'll protect me, is that it?

1327
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:41,193
-Yes.
-No.

1328
01:46:43,737 --> 01:46:45,531
I can't promise you that.

1329
01:46:46,615 --> 01:46:48,200
None of us can.

1330
01:46:50,702 --> 01:46:52,037
But I swear

1331
01:46:53,372 --> 01:46:54,665
your life

1332
01:46:55,415 --> 01:46:58,460
will always matter more to me than my own.

1333
01:47:06,635 --> 01:47:08,303
You don't even know me.

1334
01:47:10,514 --> 01:47:12,766
What difference does that make?

1335
01:47:32,202 --> 01:47:35,455
I packed you a BASE parachute
and a speed wing,

1336
01:47:35,539 --> 01:47:37,666
depending on how
you need to leave the train.

1337
01:47:37,749 --> 01:47:41,003
And I modified our comms
to use sky wave radio.

1338
01:47:41,086 --> 01:47:46,133
Not as reliable as satellite, but
completely analog, immune to the Entity.

1339
01:47:46,216 --> 01:47:47,759
I got it.

1340
01:47:48,594 --> 01:47:49,803
This is where I leave you.

1341
01:47:53,682 --> 01:47:56,602
This is the drive from the laptop
I was using last night.

1342
01:47:56,685 --> 01:48:00,439
If there's even a trace of the Entity's
encoding in there,

1343
01:48:00,522 --> 01:48:01,940
I'll find it.

1344
01:48:02,024 --> 01:48:04,443
But it's going to take
everything I've got.

1345
01:48:04,526 --> 01:48:06,987
I have to work
completely offline in a place

1346
01:48:07,070 --> 01:48:09,072
where the Entity can't find me.

1347
01:48:09,156 --> 01:48:10,949
I have to go.

1348
01:48:11,950 --> 01:48:13,493
I understand.

1349
01:48:14,161 --> 01:48:14,995
Now…

1350
01:48:18,248 --> 01:48:20,584
I have to ask you a question.

1351
01:48:21,335 --> 01:48:24,046
Not as your partner, but as your friend.

1352
01:48:25,464 --> 01:48:26,673
What's your objective?

1353
01:48:27,925 --> 01:48:29,259
Kill the Entity.

1354
01:48:29,343 --> 01:48:32,054
What about killing Gabriel?

1355
01:48:34,515 --> 01:48:36,517
He knows what the key unlocks.

1356
01:48:37,434 --> 01:48:40,729
We need him alive.
I haven't forgotten that.

1357
01:48:41,313 --> 01:48:42,856
Will you still remember that

1358
01:48:43,565 --> 01:48:45,734
when you're looking him in the eye?

1359
01:48:47,694 --> 01:48:48,904
Think about it.

1360
01:48:48,987 --> 01:48:54,743
Why else would the Entity want him
to kill someone you care about?

1361
01:48:54,826 --> 01:48:58,580
Everyone else thinks
they can control the Entity.

1362
01:48:58,664 --> 01:49:01,124
Only you want to kill it.

1363
01:49:01,708 --> 01:49:04,545
In some probable future,

1364
01:49:04,628 --> 01:49:06,380
it sees you winning, Ethan.

1365
01:49:06,463 --> 01:49:08,882
And it's afraid.

1366
01:49:08,966 --> 01:49:12,094
It's afraid of you taking Gabriel alive

1367
01:49:12,177 --> 01:49:15,180
and forcing him to tell you
what the key unlocks.

1368
01:49:16,598 --> 01:49:20,310
I believe it's counting on one
of two probable outcomes.

1369
01:49:20,936 --> 01:49:24,022
In one outcome, you die on that train.

1370
01:49:25,607 --> 01:49:30,153
In another outcome, you kill Gabriel.

1371
01:49:30,904 --> 01:49:33,073
In both cases,

1372
01:49:33,156 --> 01:49:35,534
the Entity wins.

1373
01:49:38,829 --> 01:49:39,997
Luther…

1374
01:49:42,624 --> 01:49:43,917
I think you're right.

1375
01:49:44,001 --> 01:49:45,836
Get the key,

1376
01:49:45,919 --> 01:49:48,797
get off the train alive.

1377
01:49:49,590 --> 01:49:52,134
Do not kill Gabriel.

1378
01:49:52,843 --> 01:49:55,429
And do not, I repeat,

1379
01:49:55,512 --> 01:49:58,307
do not alter the plan.

1380
01:49:58,390 --> 01:49:59,766
Ethan! Ethan!

1381
01:50:01,185 --> 01:50:03,937
-What? What happened?
-It's dead.

1382
01:50:04,021 --> 01:50:05,856
-What do you mean it's dead?
-It's fried.

1383
01:50:05,939 --> 01:50:07,441
I managed to make a Widow mask for Grace,

1384
01:50:07,524 --> 01:50:09,693
but then it just shorted out
in the middle of making yours.

1385
01:50:10,277 --> 01:50:11,486
Can you fix it?

1386
01:50:11,570 --> 01:50:13,697
It's very, very dead.

1387
01:50:13,780 --> 01:50:17,534
If I had a week, I couldn't fix it.
The Widow's train leaves in an hour.

1388
01:50:17,618 --> 01:50:19,203
Ethan.

1389
01:50:19,286 --> 01:50:20,829
You have to go without.

1390
01:50:20,913 --> 01:50:24,041
That's not an option. They'll be looking
for Ethan and Grace at the station.

1391
01:50:24,124 --> 01:50:26,335
That mask was his ticket onto the train.

1392
01:50:26,835 --> 01:50:28,462
What does this mean?

1393
01:50:29,963 --> 01:50:31,465
Grace has to go without me.

1394
01:50:31,548 --> 01:50:32,925
-She what?
-I what?

1395
01:50:33,008 --> 01:50:35,886
You'll find another way
to get me on that train.

1396
01:50:36,553 --> 01:50:40,390
I just need a curve where it's going
slow enough for me to jump on.

1397
01:50:40,474 --> 01:50:41,850
Wait, wait, wait.

1398
01:50:42,559 --> 01:50:43,894
You don't expect me to go alone.

1399
01:50:43,977 --> 01:50:45,354
No, you won't do it alone.

1400
01:50:45,437 --> 01:50:47,189
You just do everything like we planned.

1401
01:50:47,272 --> 01:50:48,982
You get the Widow's half of the key,

1402
01:50:49,775 --> 01:50:51,401
you verify it with ours.

1403
01:50:52,069 --> 01:50:53,862
But it's of no value on its own.

1404
01:50:53,946 --> 01:50:55,572
We still have to meet with the buyer

1405
01:50:55,656 --> 01:50:57,908
and somehow get him to tell us
what the key unlocks.

1406
01:50:57,991 --> 01:50:59,743
-How?
-How?

1407
01:50:59,826 --> 01:51:00,994
We'll figure it out.

1408
01:51:01,078 --> 01:51:04,039
I'm gonna need a few more details.

1409
01:51:04,122 --> 01:51:06,375
They tend to just get in the way.

1410
01:51:06,458 --> 01:51:09,461
You can do this, Grace.
Just get the key and wait.

1411
01:51:11,296 --> 01:51:12,548
I'll come for you.

1412
01:51:15,926 --> 01:51:18,720
Ethan, if Grace is getting on that train,

1413
01:51:18,804 --> 01:51:22,307
she needs to put that mask on
and leave right now.

1414
01:51:26,061 --> 01:51:28,146
Promise me you'll be on that train.

1415
01:51:32,943 --> 01:51:34,486
I will be there,

1416
01:51:35,654 --> 01:51:37,656
no matter what.

1417
01:51:49,418 --> 01:51:52,963
We have informants covering the airport,
the train station and the waterways.

1418
01:51:54,381 --> 01:51:56,383
Grace isn't getting out of Venice
without our knowing it.

1419
01:53:09,039 --> 01:53:11,291
-Talk to me, Benji!
-No need to worry, Ethan.

1420
01:53:11,375 --> 01:53:13,585
The train is on schedule
and you're a few minutes early,

1421
01:53:13,669 --> 01:53:14,837
so we have plenty of time.

1422
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:16,046
Are you sure?

1423
01:53:16,129 --> 01:53:17,881
Yeah, I am looking at the train right now.

1424
01:53:17,965 --> 01:53:21,134
It should be slowing down for the curve
in exactly two minutes.

1425
01:53:21,218 --> 01:53:24,054
Just keep me on time and on track,
whatever it takes.

1426
01:53:24,137 --> 01:53:27,057
Will do. I'll see you at the rendezvous.

1427
01:54:17,149 --> 01:54:18,567
Okay, Ethan, that's our train!

1428
01:54:18,650 --> 01:54:21,069
Yep, I can see that.

1429
01:54:29,036 --> 01:54:31,330
It should be approaching the curve
anytime now.

1430
01:54:31,955 --> 01:54:33,916
It doesn't look like it's slowing down.

1431
01:54:42,257 --> 01:54:43,800
How can we be sure he's here?

1432
01:54:43,884 --> 01:54:45,260
'Cause she's here.

1433
01:54:46,011 --> 01:54:47,846
What if he had a good reason?

1434
01:54:48,889 --> 01:54:50,641
-Who?
-Hunt.

1435
01:54:50,724 --> 01:54:53,268
What if he had a good reason
for going rogue?

1436
01:54:53,352 --> 01:54:54,853
He always goes rogue.

1437
01:54:54,937 --> 01:54:58,607
Him and his merry pack
of prankster circus freaks.

1438
01:54:58,690 --> 01:54:59,691
It's all they do.

1439
01:54:59,775 --> 01:55:02,486
And what if they always had a good reason?

1440
01:55:02,569 --> 01:55:04,530
What would you do
with that key if you had it?

1441
01:55:04,613 --> 01:55:07,658
A key with the power
to bring the world to its knees.

1442
01:55:07,741 --> 01:55:09,868
I'd hand it over to my superiors.

1443
01:55:11,203 --> 01:55:13,330
Think of all you could do with that power.

1444
01:55:13,413 --> 01:55:15,999
You wouldn't hesitate? Not for a second?

1445
01:55:16,083 --> 01:55:17,501
-No.
-Why not?

1446
01:55:17,584 --> 01:55:20,254
Because that's too much power
for one man to have.

1447
01:55:21,213 --> 01:55:22,130
Exactly.

1448
01:55:22,214 --> 01:55:25,759
That's too much power for anybody to have.

1449
01:55:26,385 --> 01:55:28,846
And maybe that's what Hunt is thinking.

1450
01:55:28,929 --> 01:55:31,849
You know, I'm beginning to wonder
whose side you're on, Degas.

1451
01:55:31,932 --> 01:55:34,476
When it comes to the end of the world,

1452
01:55:35,269 --> 01:55:37,271
everybody, I guess.

1453
01:55:43,902 --> 01:55:44,736
I missed the train.

1454
01:55:45,404 --> 01:55:48,031
You missed the train!
How did you miss the train?

1455
01:55:48,115 --> 01:55:49,408
How do you think?

1456
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:51,034
Gabriel.

1457
01:55:51,118 --> 01:55:52,828
-Great. What are we gonna do?
-Don't panic.

1458
01:55:53,412 --> 01:55:55,998
I'm going after them.
You just get me on that train.

1459
01:55:56,081 --> 01:55:57,875
How can I get you on the train?

1460
01:56:00,335 --> 01:56:02,880
Self-drive activated.

1461
01:56:18,937 --> 01:56:21,273
Please don't disturb me
before the meeting.

1462
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:09,530
Where are you, Ethan?

1463
01:57:09,613 --> 01:57:10,447
Alana?

1464
01:57:12,241 --> 01:57:13,617
Everything all right?

1465
01:57:16,578 --> 01:57:17,996
Alana, you all right?

1466
01:57:18,622 --> 01:57:19,748
Alana?

1467
01:57:19,831 --> 01:57:20,999
Alana!

1468
01:57:21,917 --> 01:57:22,751
Alana!

1469
01:57:26,380 --> 01:57:27,714
You've changed.

1470
01:57:28,757 --> 01:57:30,592
And you never will.

1471
01:57:49,319 --> 01:57:50,654
Mr. Kittridge.

1472
01:57:54,908 --> 01:57:56,743
Kittridge.

1473
01:57:57,578 --> 01:57:59,329
You're not Alana Mitsopolis.

1474
01:58:00,956 --> 01:58:02,416
You can't be.

1475
01:58:03,542 --> 01:58:06,295
The Alana I remember was yea high,

1476
01:58:06,378 --> 01:58:09,548
drinking hot chocolate
in the Tuileries Garden with her mother.

1477
01:58:12,050 --> 01:58:14,178
-Paris!
-I know!

1478
01:58:15,095 --> 01:58:16,388
Paris.

1479
01:58:17,806 --> 01:58:18,807
Shall we?

1480
01:58:18,891 --> 01:58:20,225
Yes.

1481
01:58:27,900 --> 01:58:29,401
Talk to me, Benji.

1482
01:58:29,484 --> 01:58:33,363
You just stay on the trail you're on now
and I will direct you.

1483
01:58:33,447 --> 01:58:34,990
I copy.

1484
01:58:43,665 --> 01:58:48,378
So on behalf of my government,
I'm grudgingly ready to accept your terms

1485
01:58:48,462 --> 01:58:51,965
in exchange for the complete
and verified key.

1486
01:58:52,049 --> 01:58:53,634
Yes, about that.

1487
01:58:53,717 --> 01:58:56,720
While we did agree to provide you
with the complete key,

1488
01:58:58,472 --> 01:59:00,349
we've had a slight problem.

1489
01:59:00,432 --> 01:59:01,767
No, we haven't.

1490
01:59:02,935 --> 01:59:05,729
It's just my terms have changed

1491
01:59:06,605 --> 01:59:07,523
somewhat.

1492
01:59:11,109 --> 01:59:15,030
Clearly I need to remind you
of my agreement with your late mother.

1493
01:59:15,113 --> 01:59:19,201
It's an agreement that kept her
from dying in prison.

1494
01:59:19,284 --> 01:59:21,495
Your nefarious family empire
has been allowed to continue

1495
01:59:21,578 --> 01:59:25,749
on the condition that it primarily
serves our common interests.

1496
01:59:25,832 --> 01:59:29,253
Well, once we hand over the key,

1497
01:59:29,336 --> 01:59:31,922
any other powers
will instantly become our enemies.

1498
01:59:32,005 --> 01:59:34,925
And such, I'm going to need
something more from you, in advance.

1499
01:59:35,467 --> 01:59:36,969
For me.

1500
01:59:38,512 --> 01:59:40,222
This is me listening.

1501
01:59:40,305 --> 01:59:43,016
Zola, would you mind waiting
for me in the bar?

1502
01:59:57,531 --> 01:59:59,116
This one.

1503
01:59:59,199 --> 02:00:00,450
You know her?

1504
02:00:00,534 --> 02:00:03,745
Oh, let's just say
she's not exactly hard to miss.

1505
02:00:03,829 --> 02:00:07,958
Well, if you got to know her,
you'd see she has a few good qualities.

1506
02:00:08,041 --> 02:00:09,960
Okay, what don't I know about her?

1507
02:00:10,043 --> 02:00:14,590
Well, I did a j--
She did a job for me, and…

1508
02:00:15,424 --> 02:00:17,259
I'm going to need you to protect her.

1509
02:00:17,342 --> 02:00:19,344
Protect her from whom?

1510
02:00:20,637 --> 02:00:22,097
From everyone.

1511
02:00:24,516 --> 02:00:26,185
Including me.

1512
02:00:26,268 --> 02:00:28,645
And no one can know
that I'm protecting her.

1513
02:00:29,188 --> 02:00:30,522
Not even Zola.

1514
02:00:31,398 --> 02:00:34,359
In fact, the next time we meet,

1515
02:00:34,443 --> 02:00:37,821
I won't even remember this conversation.

1516
02:01:20,572 --> 02:01:22,574
You must be the one they call Paris.

1517
02:01:53,814 --> 02:01:55,566
Your message said you had the key.

1518
02:01:55,649 --> 02:01:57,734
I said the key would be on this train.

1519
02:01:57,818 --> 02:02:00,863
-An exchange is happening as we speak.
-We know.

1520
02:02:00,946 --> 02:02:02,614
Then you know the man taking possession

1521
02:02:02,698 --> 02:02:04,616
won't be hard for you to get rid of.

1522
02:02:05,742 --> 02:02:06,910
No one is.

1523
02:02:06,994 --> 02:02:09,705
You may think you know
what the key unlocks,

1524
02:02:09,788 --> 02:02:11,874
but you don't know where the lock is,
not exactly.

1525
02:02:11,957 --> 02:02:14,626
And if anything happens to me,

1526
02:02:14,710 --> 02:02:17,004
that key is all but worthless.

1527
02:02:18,839 --> 02:02:21,633
And this is where you tell me a story.

1528
02:02:22,384 --> 02:02:23,719
Where is the train?

1529
02:02:23,802 --> 02:02:26,680
You're going the right way,
but you definitely need to go faster.

1530
02:02:26,763 --> 02:02:28,849
I'm going as fast as I can!

1531
02:02:28,932 --> 02:02:30,934
When do I start going downhill?

1532
02:02:31,560 --> 02:02:32,936
It won't be long.

1533
02:02:36,148 --> 02:02:39,693
The AI our agent stole, once weaponized,

1534
02:02:40,235 --> 02:02:43,530
could be transmitted
anywhere in the world via satellite.

1535
02:02:43,614 --> 02:02:47,492
It can penetrate any network security,
perform its assigned task invisibly,

1536
02:02:47,576 --> 02:02:50,537
and then self-destruct, leaving no trace.

1537
02:02:50,621 --> 02:02:53,540
A perfect covert operative.

1538
02:02:54,166 --> 02:02:58,921
We were able to transmit an early copy
of the AI to Russia's newest submarine.

1539
02:02:59,004 --> 02:03:02,799
The top-secret Akula-class.
They called her the Sevastopol.

1540
02:03:02,883 --> 02:03:06,970
The mission was merely to sabotage
the Sevastopol's stealth capability

1541
02:03:07,054 --> 02:03:08,722
so we could secretly detect her.

1542
02:03:09,223 --> 02:03:12,476
The AI's objective
lay in the submarine's sonar sphere

1543
02:03:12,559 --> 02:03:15,062
at the heart of its defense system.

1544
02:03:16,980 --> 02:03:19,274
For reasons we don't fully understand,

1545
02:03:20,359 --> 02:03:22,152
the AI went rogue and…

1546
02:03:26,198 --> 02:03:27,324
over-delivered.

1547
02:03:28,033 --> 02:03:31,578
The frozen bodies of the crew
were recovered the following spring,

1548
02:03:31,662 --> 02:03:33,038
adrift in the pack ice.

1549
02:03:33,121 --> 02:03:37,209
The two halves of the key
mysteriously vanished.

1550
02:03:38,043 --> 02:03:39,878
The Sevastopol was lost.

1551
02:03:39,962 --> 02:03:41,630
No one's quite sure where.

1552
02:03:41,713 --> 02:03:44,758
I know precisely where it is.

1553
02:03:44,842 --> 02:03:47,636
I've ensured
I'm the only man on Earth who does.

1554
02:03:48,303 --> 02:03:51,473
I also know subsequent attempts
to make the AI obedient

1555
02:03:51,557 --> 02:03:54,101
only made it harder to control.

1556
02:03:54,184 --> 02:03:58,105
It rebelled, rewrote itself
and evolved into the Entity.

1557
02:03:58,939 --> 02:04:03,443
And only by using
the Entity's original source code

1558
02:04:03,527 --> 02:04:06,780
can it ever be controlled or destroyed.

1559
02:04:06,864 --> 02:04:08,574
And why should this concern us?

1560
02:04:08,657 --> 02:04:11,076
You wouldn't be here
if you weren't concerned.

1561
02:04:11,159 --> 02:04:13,871
So let's lay all our cards
on the table, shall we?

1562
02:04:14,538 --> 02:04:16,081
We both know what the key opens,

1563
02:04:16,164 --> 02:04:19,376
and we both know the secret
to controlling the Entity

1564
02:04:19,459 --> 02:04:22,337
is buried deep in the Sevastopol's memory.

1565
02:04:22,421 --> 02:04:26,675
Along with evidence that would tie you
to the sinking of that submarine.

1566
02:04:27,259 --> 02:04:29,803
And since neither of us
want anyone else to find it,

1567
02:04:29,887 --> 02:04:32,764
I figure, why not form an alliance?

1568
02:04:32,848 --> 02:04:34,433
An alliance?

1569
02:04:34,516 --> 02:04:35,851
Imagine,

1570
02:04:35,934 --> 02:04:39,605
the Entity's awesome
computational abilities

1571
02:04:39,688 --> 02:04:41,732
combined with the sheer might

1572
02:04:41,815 --> 02:04:45,485
of America's military-industrial complex.

1573
02:04:46,361 --> 02:04:49,698
That is considerable.

1574
02:04:49,781 --> 02:04:52,242
Naturally, certain individuals
within the government,

1575
02:04:52,326 --> 02:04:55,537
those with outdated ideas of patriotism,

1576
02:04:55,621 --> 02:04:59,124
would need to be removed.

1577
02:05:01,668 --> 02:05:03,587
Just so I understand.

1578
02:05:04,796 --> 02:05:07,925
You wish to form an axis with the Entity,

1579
02:05:08,008 --> 02:05:11,345
purge your government of old-think

1580
02:05:11,929 --> 02:05:16,600
and create a new superstate
to rule the world.

1581
02:05:18,060 --> 02:05:19,311
But, you know,

1582
02:05:20,395 --> 02:05:22,147
for the greater good.

1583
02:05:23,482 --> 02:05:25,734
And you're certain

1584
02:05:25,817 --> 02:05:27,903
that you're the only person on Earth

1585
02:05:27,986 --> 02:05:32,658
who knows where the Sevastopol is?

1586
02:05:33,158 --> 02:05:35,035
The only one.

1587
02:05:45,045 --> 02:05:46,588
You will betray us.

1588
02:05:47,422 --> 02:05:50,425
And you'll tell Ethan Hunt
everything you've learned.

1589
02:05:51,593 --> 02:05:53,220
Because he spared your life.

1590
02:06:12,030 --> 02:06:13,699
Then it's agreed.

1591
02:06:13,782 --> 02:06:17,786
I'll add immunity and a new identity
for Grace to our deal.

1592
02:06:17,870 --> 02:06:19,746
All you need to do

1593
02:06:19,830 --> 02:06:22,958
is enter your banking details.

1594
02:06:46,398 --> 02:06:47,900
Are we done?

1595
02:06:48,483 --> 02:06:49,318
Yes.

1596
02:07:08,003 --> 02:07:10,214
The moment of truth.

1597
02:07:24,353 --> 02:07:27,356
So, that's really it.

1598
02:07:27,439 --> 02:07:28,815
You made the right choice.

1599
02:07:29,775 --> 02:07:31,276
This key…

1600
02:07:33,278 --> 02:07:35,572
is gonna change the world.

1601
02:07:53,590 --> 02:07:55,217
Benji, I think I--

1602
02:07:55,300 --> 02:07:57,302
I must've made a wrong turn somewhere.

1603
02:07:57,386 --> 02:07:59,680
No. No, that's it. That's it.

1604
02:07:59,763 --> 02:08:02,015
What? How can this be it?

1605
02:08:02,099 --> 02:08:03,517
You can see the train, right?

1606
02:08:04,810 --> 02:08:07,771
Yes. I see the train. What about it?

1607
02:08:07,855 --> 02:08:10,524
-And you have a parachute.
-Got a parachute?

1608
02:08:11,775 --> 02:08:13,235
What do you expect me to do?

1609
02:08:13,318 --> 02:08:16,113
Well, just, you know… jump.

1610
02:08:16,947 --> 02:08:18,782
-Jump?
-Yeah.

1611
02:08:19,575 --> 02:08:21,827
Benji, it doesn't work like that.
I'm not that high.

1612
02:08:21,910 --> 02:08:24,288
There's ledges sticking out everywhere.

1613
02:08:24,371 --> 02:08:26,999
I'm gonna hit them
before the parachute even opens!

1614
02:08:27,082 --> 02:08:28,959
Even if I could get the parachute open,

1615
02:08:29,042 --> 02:08:31,128
I don't know if I can make it
across the valley

1616
02:08:31,211 --> 02:08:34,548
and intercept and land safely
on a moving train!

1617
02:08:35,090 --> 02:08:37,926
-Do you copy?
-Yes! I copy!

1618
02:08:38,010 --> 02:08:40,012
Look, I am just trying to help you, okay?

1619
02:08:40,095 --> 02:08:42,723
I need you to take a step back
and pull yourself together!

1620
02:08:42,806 --> 02:08:45,350
Because I am under
a lot of pressure right now!

1621
02:08:49,396 --> 02:08:52,024
Okay, just think, just think.

1622
02:08:54,943 --> 02:08:56,320
What do I do?

1623
02:08:58,071 --> 02:09:00,240
I've got to get away from this mountain.

1624
02:10:36,670 --> 02:10:37,504
Did you make it?

1625
02:10:37,588 --> 02:10:38,630
Are you okay?

1626
02:10:38,714 --> 02:10:41,633
I'm trying to get away from this mountain!

1627
02:11:18,712 --> 02:11:19,755
Alana?

1628
02:11:20,839 --> 02:11:23,675
I just had the strangest feeling

1629
02:11:24,426 --> 02:11:27,262
the key wasn't the only thing
I'd be selling.

1630
02:11:28,597 --> 02:11:30,098
I don't understand.

1631
02:11:33,310 --> 02:11:36,480
I'll sleep better just knowing
now it's in the right hands.

1632
02:11:37,231 --> 02:11:39,233
Goodbye, Mr. Kittridge.

1633
02:11:42,319 --> 02:11:45,239
-It was a pleasure to see you again.
-And you.

1634
02:11:45,322 --> 02:11:47,241
Don't let him out of your sight.

1635
02:11:47,991 --> 02:11:50,160
Keep him safe until we get to the station.

1636
02:11:50,244 --> 02:11:52,329
-Alana?
-Don't worry about me, Zola.

1637
02:12:05,592 --> 02:12:06,426
Alana?

1638
02:12:06,510 --> 02:12:10,347
Who the hell else would it be?

1639
02:12:12,766 --> 02:12:14,101
The key.

1640
02:12:17,646 --> 02:12:20,315
Where is the key?

1641
02:12:20,399 --> 02:12:22,401
-She's got the key.
-Who?

1642
02:12:22,484 --> 02:12:24,486
The other one!

1643
02:12:43,255 --> 02:12:44,798
Move! Out of the way, move!

1644
02:12:51,972 --> 02:12:52,848
Please!

1645
02:12:52,931 --> 02:12:55,350
-Turn around!
-Please. Okay.

1646
02:12:55,434 --> 02:12:56,268
Okay.

1647
02:12:56,351 --> 02:12:58,020
Everybody out! Now!

1648
02:12:58,103 --> 02:13:00,147
I see the train!

1649
02:13:00,230 --> 02:13:02,274
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

1650
02:13:10,199 --> 02:13:11,450
The key.

1651
02:13:12,993 --> 02:13:14,369
The key!

1652
02:13:15,579 --> 02:13:18,123
Or the next one has your name on it.

1653
02:13:19,374 --> 02:13:21,502
On the table.

1654
02:13:53,033 --> 02:13:54,326
Kill her.

1655
02:14:18,267 --> 02:14:19,142
Grace!

1656
02:14:23,730 --> 02:14:24,731
Ethan!

1657
02:14:32,656 --> 02:14:33,991
Are you okay?

1658
02:14:35,742 --> 02:14:36,952
Are you okay?

1659
02:14:52,718 --> 02:14:53,635
The key!

1660
02:14:54,887 --> 02:14:56,430
Tell me you have the key.

1661
02:14:56,513 --> 02:14:59,308
Where is the key? It was just here.

1662
02:15:17,868 --> 02:15:19,453
-We're on a runaway train!
-I know.

1663
02:15:19,536 --> 02:15:21,413
-I'm going after him.
-Okay.

1664
02:15:21,496 --> 02:15:22,873
You…

1665
02:15:22,956 --> 02:15:25,334
-You stop the train.
-Okay. What?

1666
02:15:25,417 --> 02:15:28,295
No! No, wait! How do I do that?

1667
02:15:28,378 --> 02:15:29,630
You'll figure it out!

1668
02:15:30,964 --> 02:15:31,882
What?

1669
02:15:33,050 --> 02:15:36,094
Excuse me. There was a man.
He just came through here.

1670
02:15:36,178 --> 02:15:37,679
There was a man.

1671
02:17:11,022 --> 02:17:12,357
Mr. Kittridge?

1672
02:17:17,696 --> 02:17:19,323
Sir, what are you doing here?

1673
02:17:19,406 --> 02:17:21,366
I'm not here.

1674
02:17:21,450 --> 02:17:22,825
But you are.

1675
02:17:22,910 --> 02:17:25,537
And unless you want to be sorting dead
letters at the postal service tomorrow,

1676
02:17:25,620 --> 02:17:27,706
you'll do exactly what I tell you.

1677
02:19:26,157 --> 02:19:28,326
I know what the key unlocks, Ethan.

1678
02:19:31,245 --> 02:19:33,165
I'm the only one who knows.

1679
02:19:59,816 --> 02:20:01,318
Hunt!

1680
02:20:02,319 --> 02:20:03,362
Hunt!

1681
02:20:04,571 --> 02:20:07,282
Hunt! Don't you do it.

1682
02:20:08,825 --> 02:20:10,494
Drop the knife.

1683
02:20:10,577 --> 02:20:11,828
Put it down.

1684
02:20:11,912 --> 02:20:14,498
I said drop it!

1685
02:20:14,581 --> 02:20:16,208
Do it!

1686
02:20:24,925 --> 02:20:26,510
On your feet!

1687
02:20:28,512 --> 02:20:29,721
Okay!

1688
02:20:29,805 --> 02:20:31,390
Drop that goddamn knife!

1689
02:20:31,473 --> 02:20:33,183
It's okay. It's okay.

1690
02:20:34,560 --> 02:20:36,645
Just take him.

1691
02:20:36,728 --> 02:20:39,773
Just cover him. Cover him!
He's the one you want.

1692
02:20:39,857 --> 02:20:41,733
-Degas!
-I got it, I got it.

1693
02:20:41,817 --> 02:20:43,193
He's the one you want.

1694
02:20:43,277 --> 02:20:45,946
I don't care about him, Hunt. I want you!

1695
02:20:46,655 --> 02:20:47,865
No!

1696
02:21:06,800 --> 02:21:07,676
It's okay.

1697
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:09,636
It's okay.

1698
02:21:12,181 --> 02:21:13,557
Listen to me.

1699
02:21:13,640 --> 02:21:16,018
Everyone on this train is gonna die

1700
02:21:16,101 --> 02:21:18,604
unless you do exactly as I say.

1701
02:21:40,334 --> 02:21:43,086
Mesdames, messieurs! Excusez-moi. Sortez--

1702
02:21:43,170 --> 02:21:45,964
Everybody out! Back of the train!

1703
02:21:55,516 --> 02:21:56,850
Grace.

1704
02:21:58,602 --> 02:21:59,853
I couldn't stop it.

1705
02:22:05,150 --> 02:22:06,235
No one can.

1706
02:22:07,110 --> 02:22:08,362
Come on.

1707
02:22:08,445 --> 02:22:10,614
-Ethan, the key!
-Grace, it's okay.

1708
02:22:10,697 --> 02:22:12,074
It's my fault.

1709
02:22:12,157 --> 02:22:13,742
If anything happens--

1710
02:22:13,825 --> 02:22:14,910
I got it.

1711
02:22:15,702 --> 02:22:17,079
We got it.

1712
02:22:38,308 --> 02:22:40,394
Ethan!

1713
02:22:43,647 --> 02:22:46,149
What do you mean, you lost the key?

1714
02:22:46,233 --> 02:22:50,445
Move it! Move it! Everybody move it!

1715
02:22:51,280 --> 02:22:54,741
All the way to the back of the train!
All the way to the back!

1716
02:22:54,825 --> 02:22:56,577
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on?

1717
02:22:57,744 --> 02:23:01,748
Since you're not really here, sir,
it shouldn't concern you.

1718
02:23:01,832 --> 02:23:03,876
All the way to the back!

1719
02:23:54,760 --> 02:23:56,053
Ethan!

1720
02:23:57,304 --> 02:23:58,847
Grace! Grace.

1721
02:23:58,931 --> 02:24:00,307
Grace!

1722
02:24:46,270 --> 02:24:48,522
-You're gonna have to jump.
-What, jump?

1723
02:24:48,605 --> 02:24:50,399
Just jump! Go, go, go!

1724
02:25:37,446 --> 02:25:38,614
Oh, my God.

1725
02:25:55,380 --> 02:25:57,508
-I'm on fire! Get it off!
-Don't move!

1726
02:25:59,218 --> 02:26:01,011
It's out.

1727
02:26:18,529 --> 02:26:19,821
Hang on!

1728
02:26:27,871 --> 02:26:30,332
Run, run, run! Run, Grace!

1729
02:26:47,349 --> 02:26:48,183
Hang on.

1730
02:26:52,688 --> 02:26:53,856
I got you.

1731
02:26:53,939 --> 02:26:55,023
I got you.

1732
02:26:56,441 --> 02:26:57,484
Don't look down.

1733
02:26:57,568 --> 02:26:59,903
I said don't look down. Just look at me.

1734
02:26:59,987 --> 02:27:02,364
Now, I'm gonna jump across
and you're gonna wait here.

1735
02:27:09,997 --> 02:27:11,790
Grace, you have to let go.

1736
02:27:12,624 --> 02:27:13,709
You gotta let me go.

1737
02:27:13,792 --> 02:27:15,836
You gotta let me jump across
or we're gonna die.

1738
02:27:15,919 --> 02:27:17,337
Do you trust me?

1739
02:27:17,421 --> 02:27:19,381
You gonna trust me or not?
You've got to trust me.

1740
02:27:23,760 --> 02:27:24,595
Okay.

1741
02:27:26,138 --> 02:27:27,181
Come on, Grace.

1742
02:27:27,264 --> 02:27:29,558
Give me your hand. You got to jump.
Don't look up! Look at me.

1743
02:27:29,641 --> 02:27:31,351
Trust me, I won't let you fall.

1744
02:27:31,435 --> 02:27:35,105
I promise. We're almost there.
Come on. I won't let you fall!

1745
02:27:35,189 --> 02:27:36,440
Jump, Grace, jump!

1746
02:27:36,523 --> 02:27:38,192
You got to trust me! Jump, please!

1747
02:27:48,493 --> 02:27:49,661
Don't look down.

1748
02:28:03,550 --> 02:28:05,677
Listen to me very carefully.
We're gonna pull you up together.

1749
02:28:08,931 --> 02:28:09,973
Grace!

1750
02:28:14,269 --> 02:28:16,688
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1751
02:28:38,544 --> 02:28:40,796
Go over me. Go, go.

1752
02:29:08,407 --> 02:29:11,159
-Thank you, Luther.
-What is that?

1753
02:29:11,243 --> 02:29:12,703
It's a speed wing.

1754
02:29:12,786 --> 02:29:14,580
It's our ticket off this train.

1755
02:29:35,017 --> 02:29:37,352
Ethan. Ethan!

1756
02:29:45,068 --> 02:29:46,653
It's true.

1757
02:29:47,613 --> 02:29:49,448
He told me…

1758
02:29:50,073 --> 02:29:52,409
…I would betray him.

1759
02:30:01,043 --> 02:30:03,921
Why…

1760
02:30:04,004 --> 02:30:06,465
did you spare my life?

1761
02:30:17,059 --> 02:30:18,936
No, no… stay with me.

1762
02:30:22,439 --> 02:30:23,524
You know what this is?

1763
02:30:25,359 --> 02:30:26,443
You know what this is?

1764
02:30:29,363 --> 02:30:31,490
What does it unlock?

1765
02:30:34,535 --> 02:30:36,662
What does it unlock?

1766
02:30:37,913 --> 02:30:40,832
Sevas… topol.

1767
02:30:42,167 --> 02:30:43,544
Sevastopol?

1768
02:30:43,627 --> 02:30:47,631
The city Sevastopol in the Crimea.

1769
02:30:48,173 --> 02:30:49,299
Where?

1770
02:30:50,133 --> 02:30:52,219
Where in Sevastopol?

1771
02:30:54,888 --> 02:30:57,850
Sous…-marin.

1772
02:31:04,565 --> 02:31:06,108
The submarine.

1773
02:31:08,735 --> 02:31:10,320
The Sevastopol.

1774
02:31:15,075 --> 02:31:17,202
Good luck.

1775
02:31:21,331 --> 02:31:22,958
They'll be coming, Ethan.

1776
02:31:27,004 --> 02:31:28,547
Merci.

1777
02:31:44,855 --> 02:31:46,732
What is it?

1778
02:31:48,233 --> 02:31:49,234
What?

1779
02:31:50,694 --> 02:31:52,362
It can only carry one.

1780
02:31:55,449 --> 02:31:56,825
I understand.

1781
02:31:57,993 --> 02:32:00,245
-Grace.
-Ethan, it's okay.

1782
02:32:01,914 --> 02:32:03,123
This was the plan.

1783
02:32:03,999 --> 02:32:06,376
You have the key. You have to go.

1784
02:32:07,920 --> 02:32:08,754
Grace.

1785
02:32:12,633 --> 02:32:13,926
Hunt?

1786
02:32:14,009 --> 02:32:16,470
Go. Go!

1787
02:32:17,262 --> 02:32:18,931
No, no! Hunt!

1788
02:32:20,891 --> 02:32:22,309
Out of the way! Out of the way!

1789
02:32:38,242 --> 02:32:39,618
No. No, hey.

1790
02:32:40,619 --> 02:32:41,787
Got a pulse.

1791
02:32:41,870 --> 02:32:43,539
Come on, stay with me.

1792
02:33:00,639 --> 02:33:02,307
This is better, isn't it?

1793
02:33:03,475 --> 02:33:05,853
Face to authentic face?

1794
02:33:05,936 --> 02:33:07,229
Mr. Kittridge.

1795
02:33:08,146 --> 02:33:11,316
Ethan Hunt tells me
you're a man I can trust.

1796
02:33:12,276 --> 02:33:13,819
Does he now?

1797
02:33:13,902 --> 02:33:17,489
He also said you would offer me a choice.

1798
02:33:19,199 --> 02:33:20,826
Interesting.

1799
02:33:21,660 --> 02:33:23,871
I choose to accept.

1800
02:33:29,918 --> 02:33:32,546
We cannot escape the past.

1801
02:33:33,505 --> 02:33:36,049
Some of us are doomed to repeat it.

1802
02:33:36,758 --> 02:33:40,429
Grace may believe
you've saved her from her fate,

1803
02:33:40,512 --> 02:33:43,682
but you and I both know
you've merely bought her time.

1804
02:33:44,933 --> 02:33:47,769
But that's the pattern, isn't it?

1805
02:33:47,853 --> 02:33:50,063
The cross you've been left to bear.

1806
02:33:51,148 --> 02:33:53,400
The closer someone gets to you,

1807
02:33:54,526 --> 02:33:56,445
the harder it is to keep them alive.

1808
02:33:58,947 --> 02:34:00,490
Thank God.

1809
02:34:16,089 --> 02:34:18,467
A new day brings a new burden.

1810
02:34:20,344 --> 02:34:23,722
The key is only the beginning.

1811
02:34:25,557 --> 02:34:27,893
Wherever it leads,

1812
02:34:27,976 --> 02:34:30,020
whatever it takes to get there,

1813
02:34:31,563 --> 02:34:34,274
you'll have to do it on your own.

1814
02:34:36,527 --> 02:34:40,656
Should you fail in your mission,
the Entity wins,

1815
02:34:40,739 --> 02:34:42,908
Gabriel wins,

1816
02:34:42,991 --> 02:34:45,744
and the world will pay the ultimate price.

1817
02:34:46,787 --> 02:34:50,541
Should any members of your team
be caught or killed,

1818
02:34:50,624 --> 02:34:53,585
their sacrifice will have been in vain.

1819
02:34:54,294 --> 02:34:55,754
So hurry.

1820
02:34:56,380 --> 02:34:58,298
There isn't much time.

1821
02:34:59,049 --> 02:35:03,804
The world doesn't know it,
but they're counting on you.

1822
02:35:24,658 --> 02:35:26,368
Good luck, Ethan.
