687
00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:41,904
                DID YOU FIND

689
00:40:48,778 --> 00:40:52,314
        WONDER WHAT
    THEY'LL FIND IN THERE.

690
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:54,616
    YOU GOT ANY IDEAS, MIKE?

WHAT IS IT?

696
00:41:24,147 --> 00:41:26,148
        QUIT DIGGING.

697
00:41:26,816 --> 00:41:29,251
    IT AIN'T HUMAN, FRANK.

698
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:31,987
        SOME HUNTER

711
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,876
I DON'T GET THIS.

712
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,411
MY BEST FRIEND

822
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,603
GET OFF OF ME! GET OFF!

823
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:29,504
                    CALM DOWN.

824
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:31,139
    SON OF A BITCH.

825
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:31,973
            BACK AWAY FROM THERE

826
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:34,976
        AND LET MISS IDA
        THROUGH WITH THAT FOOD.

827
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:35,610
            GOD ALMIGHTY.

828
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:38,713
            GET OVER THERE AND
            DRINK THAT COFFEE

829
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:40,181
            BEFORE IT GETS COLD.

830
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:42,584
            HOW ARE
            YOU BOYS TODAY?

831
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,351
ANYTHING, MIKE?

832
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:45,086
                [BLAKE]
                HOW'S MY BOY?

833
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,421
            NO. THANKS, IDA.

834
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,556
    SIT DOWN, DAVID. SIT DOWN.

835
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:50,992
    COOL DOWN, FELLAS.

836
00:48:51,427 --> 00:48:53,628
    LISTEN, FELLAS,
    I WANT YOU ALL TO KNOW

837
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:58,066
    THAT THERE'S NOT A DAMN
    THING PERSONAL IN THIS.

838
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:00,468
    NOW, WHERE'S YOUR FRIEND?

839
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:02,604
                WHICH ONE?

840
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,172
    COME ON, MIKE.

841
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:05,774
            THE ONE
            WITH THE ATTITUDE.

842
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:09,778
    IF YOU MEAN DALLIS,
    I DON'T KNOW.

    FOR Y'ALL.

844
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:16,484
    I WANT YOU TO TAKE
    A LIE DETECTOR TEST.

845
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:18,353
    IF YOU'RE
    TELLING THE TRUTH,

846
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:21,489

    STRENGTHEN YOUR CAUSE.

        WE'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

848
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:28,096
    I GOT A GOOD MAN RIGHT
    HERE IN THE STATE.

849

    ANYTIME Y'ALL FEEL LIKE IT.

850

                THINK ABOUT IT!

851
00:49:35,671 --> 00:49:39,274
            WHY DON'T WE HAVE
            A LITTLE TALK, MIKE,

852
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:41,176
            HUH...OUTSIDE?

853
00:49:56,158 --> 00:49:58,493
            YOUNG GREG
            TOLD US THE TRUTH

854
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,628
            ABOUT THE CUT
            ON DALLIS' HAND.

855
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:04,699
        IT WASN'T A PAPER CUT,
        WAS IT?

856
00:50:05,201 --> 00:50:07,268
        HE HAD AN ALTERCATION
        WITH TRAVIS

857
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:10,538
        ON THE DAY OF
        THE DISAPPEARANCE, TRUE?

858
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:13,608
I GUESS.

859
00:50:13,743 --> 00:50:17,045
            AND I THINK YOU'RE
            STARTING TO GET

860
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:19,280
            A PRETTY GOOD FEEL
            FOR WHO I AM.

861
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:22,050
            I'VE BEEN AT
            THIS LINE OF WORK

862
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:22,851
            FOR A LONG TIME.

863
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:26,855
            YOU KNOW WHAT'S
            STARTING TO BUG ME?

864
00:50:27,089 --> 00:50:31,192
        I THINK MAYBE YOU
        DIDN'T KILL YOUR FRIEND.

865
00:50:31,827 --> 00:50:33,695
        BUT FOR THE LIFE OF ME,

866
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:38,033
        I CAN'T FIGURE
        WHY YOU'RE COVERING UP.

867
00:50:44,573 --> 00:50:46,808
                WHAT THE HECK'S
                HE WANT?

868
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:48,376
I DON'T KNOW.

869
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:49,411
LET'S GO.

870
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:50,912
                WHERE WE GOING?

871
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:51,713
TO FIND DALLIS.

872
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:56,051
        DALLIS? I THOUGHT YOU
        DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.

873
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,652
    I LIED.

874
00:51:00,089 --> 00:51:03,591
ALL RIGHT, I'M--I'M
GOING TO RAISE YOU 2.

875
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:06,828
                I'M GOING
                TO RAISE YOU.

876
00:51:12,435 --> 00:51:16,571
            CAN'T YOU SPEAK
            AMERICAN, PLEASE?

877
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:20,275
                    [SPEAKING
                    SPANISH]

    [SPEAKING SPANISH]

879
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:51,739
            WELL?

880
00:51:52,007 --> 00:51:53,408
            I HEARD
    WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING

881
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:56,311
    IN THAT STUPID LITTLE
    MORMON TOWN OF YOURS.

882
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:57,112
    I TOLD YOU CHUCKLEHEADS

883
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,914
    THAT STORY WAS NEVER
    GOING TO WORK, DIDN'T I?

884
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:02,417
THEY TOOK AWAY OUR
LOGGING CONTRACT, DALLIS.

885
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:03,818
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

886
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:04,319
        THAT FIGURES.

887
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:06,321
    THEY'RE A BUNCH
    OF CHICKEN-SHIT ASSHOLES.

888
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:08,456
                SPEAKING OF
                CHICKEN SHIT,

889
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,658
                WHERE YOU BEEN?

890
00:52:11,794 --> 00:52:12,794
        I'VE BEEN AROUND.

891
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:16,030
    YOU KNEW WHERE TO FIND ME,
        DIDN'T YOU, MIKE?

892
00:52:16,032 --> 00:52:18,366
DAVIS AND WATTERS
ARE LOOKING FOR YOU.

893
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:20,435
THEY KNOW ABOUT
YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD,

894
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:23,805
THAT YOU LIED ABOUT
HOW YOU HURT YOUR HAND.

895
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:25,073
                YOU'RE JUST FULL
                OF INFORMATION.

896
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:27,642
IT DON'T MAKE US
LOOK GOOD WHEN YOU--

897
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:28,143
            IT DON'T?

898
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,445
            THAT'S TOO DAMN BAD,
            AIN'T IT?

899
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:31,746
NO, IT DON'T!
IT DON'T!

900
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:35,016
            THEY WANT US TO TAKE
            A LIE DETECTOR TEST.

901
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:38,419
            WHAT DO YOU THINK
            ABOUT IT?

902
00:52:39,355 --> 00:52:42,690
        YOU WANT TO KNOW
    WHAT I THINK ABOUT IT?

903
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:43,892
                THAT'S RIGHT.

904
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:46,561
        I'LL TELL YOU
        WHAT I THINK.

905
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:49,931
    I THINK THOSE DEVICES
    ARE VERY DANGEROUS, MAN.

906
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:51,332
    THAT MACHINE SAYS YOU LIED,

907
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:55,069
        IT DON'T MATTER
    IF YOU TOLD THE TRUTH,

908
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:55,737
        YOU LIED!

909
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:58,873
            IT MIGHT CLEAR US,
            THOUGH.

910
00:53:00,676 --> 00:53:03,511
    OH, IT MIGHT CLEAR YOU.

911
00:53:06,749 --> 00:53:10,318
    YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T
        NEED A--A BODY

912
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,788
    TO PRESS MURDER CHARGES,
    DID YOU KNOW THAT?

913
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:14,455
    DID YOU KNOW THAT?

914
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:17,258
    AND THEY AIN'T NEVER
    GOING TO FIND TRAVIS,

915
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:18,126
    WE KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

916
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:21,129
    THE PRESSURE'S ON
    DAVIS AND WATTERS

917
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:22,130
    TO SOLVE THE CASE.

918
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:25,500
    WHO DO YOU THINK
    THEY'LL ZERO IN ON?

919
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:27,035
    WHAT, YOU, CHOIRBOY, HUH?

920
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:30,972
    GOD WILL SEND A SWARM
    OF LOCUST DOWN ON THEM.

921
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:33,608
        YOU, MR. PILLAR
        OF THE COMMUNITY?

922
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,710
    NO. I DON'T THINK SO.

923
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:36,844
    NO, THE QUESTION IS HOW LONG

924
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:40,181
    BEFORE YOU BOYS DECIDE
    TO SAVE YOUR WHITE ASSES

925
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:42,083
    AND POINT THE FINGER AT ME?

926
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:43,017
THAT'S A LOAD OF CRUD.

927
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:47,155
    NO! THAT'S EXACTLY THE WAY
    IT'S GOING TO BE!

928
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:48,089
                IF WE DECIDE

929
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:51,693
                TO TAKE THIS LIE
                DETECTOR TEST...

930
00:53:53,262 --> 00:53:54,062
                WE ALL TAKE IT.

931
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:57,031
    DON'T YOU POINT
    YOUR FINGER AT ME.

932
00:53:57,033 --> 00:53:58,666
                ALL RIGHT, MIKE!
                COME ON!

933
00:53:58,668 --> 00:53:59,834

00:54:10,613 --> 00:54:14,716
