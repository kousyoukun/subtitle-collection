1
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,440
- What the hell's that all about?
- Nothing.

2
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,040
Hey, Mike, you in a hurry?

3
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,080
What's with them?

4
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,600
Maybe they're just tired.

5
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,760
Sorry, boys, the kitchen's closed.

6
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,720
We're sticking to the story.

7
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,200
No matter how rough it gets,
understand?

8
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,360
Whatever.

9
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,160
Greg?

10
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,880
Go ahead, Mike, make that phone call.
We're all with you. Go on.

11
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,240
That's right, man.

12
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,640
That's right, go.

13
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,600
Working your boys kind of late tonight,
were you, Mike?

14
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,080
<i>This is Sergeant Reynolds</i>
<i>from Criminal Investigations</i>

15
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,160
<i>calling Lieutenant Frank Watters.</i>
<i>Are you there, lieutenant? Over.</i>

16
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,480
- "Lieutenant, do you read me? Over."
- I'm here, sergeant.

17
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,920
<i>I've checked with Sheriff Davis.</i>
<i>He says he'll give you all the details</i>

18
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,000
<i>when you get to Snowflake. Over.</i>

19
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,760
What's his problem?

20
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,520
<i>Frank, it sounds like he's</i>
<i>in over his head on this one. Over.</i>

21
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,320
I hear you.

22
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,560
Police investigation. There's nothing
for you to see or to hear, so just...

23
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,880
Everybody just go on home, now.
There's nothing to see.

24
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,760
Get in your cars, take your kids,
take your families, go on home.

25
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,800
Lieutenant Watters?

26
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,880
- I'm Frank Watters.
- Sheriff Blake Davis.

27
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,040
I know a lot about you, yes, sir,
from the papers.

28
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,200
Sure do. About you not having any
unsolved cases here or in Montana.

29
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,040
Nothing but a myth.
But a damn fine one.

30
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,640
Now, why the radio silence
on bringing me here, sheriff?

31
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,320
Well, we got a special kind
of situation here, Frank.

32
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,240
A missing boy on our hands.
Travis Walton.

33
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,760
About an hour ago, a deputy of mine
took a missing-persons report

34
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,360
from a fella by the name of Rogers.
Mike Rogers.

35
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,200
I've known him a long time.
He's a good guy, straight guy.

36
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,240
He's been running a crew
up the Mogollon Rim

37
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,360
near Turkey Spring
for about a month.

38
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,520
Yep, they had a government contract
to clear out the brush.

39
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,160
Dennis!

40
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,560
I want you to meet my deputy.

41
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,640
Dennis, shake hands
with Lieutenant Watters. Deputy Clay.

42
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,600
- Hi, Dennis.
- It's an honor, lieutenant.

43
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,200
I read about that wetback murder
you handled down Nogales way.

44
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,880
Dennis, can you tell us who else
is in that gang besides Mike Rogers?

45
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,520
Yeah. We got David Whitlock, 26.
Local boy, active in the church.

46
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,400
<i>Greg Hayes, 17.</i>
<i>High school kid from Winslow.</i>

47
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,560
<i>This one's pretty shook-up.</i>
<i>Robert Cogdill, 20, from Durango.</i>

48
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,800
<i>Joined the crew just a week ago.</i>
<i>Allan Dallis, 25.</i>

49
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,200
<i>A drifter,</i>
<i>on the crew just over two weeks.</i>

50
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,560
- Bad apple, if you ask me.
- Yeah. He's got hell in his eye.

51
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,440
Sure does.

52
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,320
Frank, I think that...

53
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
I think that maybe...

54
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,760
Maybe you better hear this
from the horse's mouth.

55
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,240
Lead me to the horse.

56
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,720
- Dennis, get these folks out of here.
- Come on, folks.

57
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,600
Give them some room.

58
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,120
Restaurant's closed for the night.

59
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,240
- Now, what in the hell is that thing for?
- It bother you?

60
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,640
- Yeah, it bothers me.
- I don't want any misinterpretations.

61
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,000
This way there's a clear record
of everything you tell us.

62
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,280
Well, we already told that Barney Fife
of a deputy everything we know.

63
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,280
I'll tell you, Frank,

64
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,520
Clay wrote down everything.

65
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,800
We'll use the recorder.

66
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,920
A man with nothing to hide
is a man with nothing to worry about.

67
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,040
- You're the leader, right?
- Yeah.

68
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,720
Yeah, he's our fearless leader.

69
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,840
Maybe I should be
talking to you instead.

70
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:43,400
Oh, no. No, sir. He's the boss.
There's no doubt about that.

71
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,880
Tell me about Travis Walton.

72
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,440
- About what happened?
- About Travis.

73
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,760
Start by telling me who he is.

74
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,280
He's...

75
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,120
He was my best friend.

76
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,320
Wake up, Dad, wake up.
Wake up, Dad.

77
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,800
It's the tickle monster!
It's the tickle monster.

78
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,160
Ow, what are you doing?
Daddy just cracked his elbow.

79
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,960
How are you? Good morning.

80
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,280
- Good morning. What are you doing?
- Breakfast is ready!

81
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,600
- Waking you up.
- Who told you to wake me up?

82
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,000
- Mommy did!
- Mommy did!

83
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,440
Why did she tell you to wake me up?

84
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,920
Because she wants me
to tickle you again?

85
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,440
Travis, you son of a bitch,
get off that bike!

86
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,200
Cathy, what are you doing?

87
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,280
Nothing, Mom.

88
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,560
Hey, get that thing
off the sidewalk, Travis!

89
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,760
Here you go. Coming in. There you go.
You want butter on that?

90
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,360
- Can I have some French toast?
- Sure.

91
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,120
I can have some?

92
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,960
I got some for you right here.

93
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,360
No, I gotta go.
I gotta get the truck running.

94
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,000
Wait a sec. Let me talk to you
for a second, please.

95
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,760
What...? The bank's gonna
call again today.

96
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,240
- So?
- So, what should I tell them?

97
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,040
Do we have to talk about that
right now?

98
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,640
No, you know what? We can wait
till they throw us out of our house.

99
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,600
Hey, Mike!

100
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,920
Morning.

101
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,840
What's the matter?

102
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,000
You and Katie again?

103
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,760
Hey, Mike, want a doughnut?

104
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,680
Make you feel better.

105
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,680
About time we got yours
back on the road, don't you think?

106
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,400
Unless you got some secret plan
to let it rust and sell it for scrap.

107
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,280
We'll start tonight.
What do you think?

108
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,200
I gotta show you something.

109
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,560
- What's this?
- This is our future.

110
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,400
MT Motors.

111
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,360
Serving all of Navajo County.

112
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,720
Harleys, Nortons, Yamahas,
you name it.

113
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,560
We'll do commercials like the guys
in Phoenix.

114
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,600
"MT Motors. Our prices are so great,
our show room

115
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,400
is almost always empty."

116
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,920
Get it? Empty. M-T. Motors.

117
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,240
Empty. What do you think?

118
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,360
I think we better just concentrate
on finishing the contract.

119
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,120
The Forest Service
won't extend the deadline.

120
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,720
Mike, don't worry. This is the deal.

121
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,000
Look, Travis, my mortgage
is on the line.

122
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,400
I gotta worry. I got no choice, man.

123
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,520
We'll get it done or we won't.

124
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,600
Hey, where you going?

125
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,960
Love awaits me.

126
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,880
Look, it's Uncle Travis.

127
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,360
- Hi, Uncle Travis.
- God. Travis, can't you use the door?

128
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,720
- No.
- Go...

129
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,160
- Morning.
- Good morning.

130
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,800
Breakfast in bed.

131
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,520
Thank you.

132
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,800
Dana, let's get married.
I can't wait anymore.

133
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,000
- Travis.
- Don't answer. Don't answer. Just...

134
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,000
Just think about it.

135
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,120
Okay.

136
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,720
Can we get going, please?
Before I get seriously sick.

137
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,040
- See you later.
- Okay.

138
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,160
How you doing, fellas?

139
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,960
- Good morning.
- Hi, guys.

140
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,280
Bobby, every day I tell you
turn it down or turn it off.

141
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,520
I'm not gonna tell you again.

142
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,520
You need to listen
to some blues, man.

143
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,320
You guys got any doughnuts
up there?

144
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,760
Well, we did, Dallis,
but we ate them all.

145
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,320
Hey, listen to this, man:

146
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,040
"Lady in Borneo gives birth
to a litter of 13."

147
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,360
- Litter?
- Yeah.

148
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,080
- Bunch of bullshit.
- What do you mean, man?

149
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,000
It's right here. Read it.

150
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,120
Get out of my way.

151
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,000
- Hey, leave him alone.
- Shut up, mind your own business.

152
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,640
What if I make it my business?

153
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,160
Is that what you want, dude?
You wanna make it your business?

154
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,240
Can we have one day
without you two girls fighting,

155
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,960
- please?
- Why don't you shut up, David.

156
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,720
- Hey! Knock it off, man.
- You knock it off.

157
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,480
- No, you knock it off, Dallis, now.
- No, you knock it off.

158
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,720
Come on, man. This is a good song.

159
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,480
Turn it down, Bobby. I mean it.

160
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,160
All right, boys. Let's get moving.

161
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,840
All right, listen up.
It's gonna be a long day.

162
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,360
David and Dallis, you guys alternate
on the big saw to buck the windfall.

163
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,280
- Bobby and Greg are on cleanup.
- Right.

164
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,040
Let's try to get the east side
of Pine Mountain before sundown.

165
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,400
All right? Get the water. Let's go.

166
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,400
Another day, another dollar.

167
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,240
Down the hill!

168
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,080
Wide load now.

169
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,120
Timber.

170
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,400
All right, lunch!

171
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,640
Not too bright!

172
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,640
Can't hear you.

173
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,240
Hey, knock it off, Dallis!
I said, lunch!

174
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,320
Dallis!

175
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,720
- Hey.
- Hey, bud.

176
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,440
What do you say we do a little fishing
when the contract's over?

177
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,920
When this contract's over, huh?

178
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,360
Come on, it's what we need.
One of our camping trips.

179
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,480
Some hunting, some fishing,
chasing bears.

180
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,640
Oh, yeah, I remember.
You ran that bear up that tree.

181
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,800
I was just trying to make friends.

182
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,720
So how come you can't
make friends with Dallis?

183
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,280
He's just jealous
I can do something he can't.

184
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,200
- Oh, yeah? What's that?
- Read and write.

185
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,320
So, what do you say, man?
A little R and R, and then MT Motors.

186
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,240
You think I'm gonna let
a flake like you marry my little sister?

187
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,640
A flake from Snowflake. How poetic.
I like that.

188
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,800
Yeah, that's just my point.

189
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,520
What's your point?

190
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,360
You're a dreamer.
And you're not ready for marriage.

191
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,920
Not if I gotta turn into you...

192
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,800
...Mike.

193
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,440
We went back to work,

194
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,520
and we finished up
along about dusk.

195
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,960
The day's work was done,
and the five of you left the work site.

196
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,880
Six. There was six of us.

197
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,480
- Travis Walton left with you?
- Of course.

198
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,400
The rest of you boys
go along with that?

199
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,280
Yes.

200
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,160
How about you, Mr. Dallis?

201
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,360
You go along with that?

202
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,400
Oh, yeah, I go along with that.

203
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,600
You don't sound too sure.

204
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,600
Well, I'm sure.

205
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,880
- What's it to you?
- Oh, it just seems like that you had

206
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,920
the biggest ax to grind with Travis.

207
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,280
What was that whole thing
with that chain saw?

208
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,480
I was just having some fun.

209
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,680
That's all.

210
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,440
You gonna arrest me for that?

211
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,560
What happened to your hand?

212
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,960
I did it to myself earlier today.

213
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,720
Just having a little fun?

214
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,440
Yeah, that's right,
I was just having a little fun.

215
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,960
You ought to be more careful, son.

216
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,520
Yeah, well, I'll do my best, Daddy.

217
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,720
I'll bet you will.

218
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,680
Why don't you fellas
tell Lieutenant Watters what you saw.

219
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,080
Or what you think you saw.

220
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,120
It was Dallis that saw it first.

221
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,880
What about it?

222
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,400
Tell us about it. What did you see?

223
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,400
What did it look like?

224
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,480
It looked like...

225
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,400
Like a fire.

226
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,480
- You awake?
- I'm awake.

227
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,320
What in the hell is that?

228
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,840
That is strange.

229
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,240
What is?
What are you guys looking at?

230
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,640
Looks like the sunset to me.

231
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,520
No, Greg, that's east. The sun set
behind us 20 minutes ago.

232
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,520
Well, what do you think it is, then?

233
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,680
Maybe a fire or maybe
a plane crash in the woods.

234
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,880
Yeah. Yeah, a plane crash.
It could be.

235
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,080
Christ, man.

236
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,240
Hey, what the hell is that?

237
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,360
Maybe we should just
turn back, huh?

238
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,720
That's gotta be a fire.

239
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,640
Look, it's moving.

240
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,400
I saw it.

241
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,200
- It isn't moving, Bobby. It isn't...
- Look, man.

242
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,960
Is it?

243
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,120
That's one monster forest fire there.

244
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,760
Fire, my ass.

245
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,840
That ain't no fire, man.

246
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,920
What else could it be?

247
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,400
The heck is going on here, Mike?

248
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,320
- You screwing around?
- No.

249
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,520
Mike, maybe we ought to do
like Greg says

250
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,120
and just pull over for a minute.

251
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,240
No, Mike. I wanna see what it is.

252
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,080
There's only one road out of here,
and we're on it.

253
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,320
If that's a fire
and we can't get around it,

254
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,160
we're gonna be
spending the night out here.

255
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,680
Mike?

256
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,840
Stop, Mike! Stop the truck!

257
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,680
- That's wild.
- Holy Christ.

258
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,080
- Travis!
- Travis!

259
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,000
- You son of a bitch!
- The hell you doing?

260
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,120
Get back in the truck, asshole!

261
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,960
What is that?

262
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,080
- What is that thing?
- Oh, my God!

263
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,920
Travis!

264
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,960
The hell's he doing out there?

265
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,280
- Get back to the truck!
- The hell is that?

266
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,960
- Travis!
- Get back in the truck!

267
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,120
- Get out of there.
- What is that?

268
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,840
I don't know what that is.

269
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,200
Hey, Mike!

270
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,760
Travis, get out of there!

271
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,440
Leave the son of a bitch here
if he's gonna be an asshole!

272
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,240
Travis, get back here! Travis!

273
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,800
Run, Travis, run!

274
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,280
- What the hell is that?
- Do you feel that?

275
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,680
- Crazy...
- Travis!

276
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,640
- Travis!
- Get the hell out of here!

277
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,240
- Get back in here! Travis!
- What the hell is that?

278
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,720
Travis!

279
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,120
He's...

280
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,400
- He's...
- Go! Go!

281
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,560
Go! Go!

282
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,160
Mike, he's dead! He's dead!

283
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,720
- Oh, Mike, he's gone!
- Go!

284
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,160
- I'm not leaving him.
- He's dead!

285
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,320
I'm not leaving him here!

286
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,160
- Go! Get out of here! Go!
- Get the hell out of here, Mike!

287
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,360
He's dead.

288
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,920
What the hell you doing?
He's dead!

289
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,760
- He's dead. He's dead.
- Come on!

290
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,880
- Get the hell out of here!
- Let's go!

291
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,160
Go! Go!

292
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,960
- He's dead?
- Oh, my God!

293
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,680
It's moving! It's coming after us, man!
It's gonna kill us.

294
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,680
Stay down! Stay down!
Everybody stay down!

295
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,520
Slow down, Mike!

296
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,760
- What is that thing?
- I don't know.

297
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,040
- What the heck was that thing?!
- I don't know!

298
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,240
I don't know, Mike!
I don't know what it is.

299
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,520
- What was it?
- Oh, my God!

300
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,000
What was that?

301
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,840
Slow down, Mike!

302
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,320
Shit!

303
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,360
Come on, man, you're gonna kill us.

304
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,440
- Is it following us?
- I don't know.

305
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,720
I can't see it. Is it following us?

306
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,240
- I don't know!
- Shut up!

307
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,200
- Come on!
- Look out!

308
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,960
- Come on, man!
- Get off of me!

309
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,040
What in the hell you stopping for?

310
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,120
We left him there.

311
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,360
- He's dead, jackass!
- We gotta go back.

312
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,200
- No!
- No way. What are you talking about?

313
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,840
No, maybe we do gotta go back.
Maybe we gotta go back!

314
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,920
- No way! No!
- No way, man! No!

315
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,840
We don't know that he's dead yet.

316
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,720
- Get out of here! Let's get...!
- What are you talking about?

317
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,120
I'm going back! I'm going back!

318
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,440
If you don't wanna go,
get out of the car now.

319
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,000
I'll come pick you up later.

320
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,560
- You can't do this to us, man.
- What if you don't come back, Mike?

321
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,840
Get out.

322
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,120
Go, man. You gotta go. Get out.

323
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,320
It'll be all right. You stay by the road.

324
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,240
Son of a bitch.

325
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,680
I...

326
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,000
I searched the woods and...

327
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,800
But he wasn't...

328
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,640
There was nothing...

329
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,520
They took him.

330
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,240
You expect me to believe

331
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,440
that a flying saucer came down
and took your friend away

332
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,600
to outer space?

333
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,440
That's the truth, mister.
That's exactly what happened.

334
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,840
Is it?

335
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,320
Is it? According to your story,
you never even went back

336
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,080
to the clearing,
so you don't know, do you?

337
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,960
I didn't have to go back.

338
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,000
Mike Rogers says he wasn't there,
you can take it to the bank.

339
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,000
And you know that, Blake.

340
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,840
Why the heck aren't you
speaking up for us?

341
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,920
Why you letting this man
talk to us like this?

342
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,000
- David, I...
- It seems like you're not even trying

343
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,000
to believe us.

344
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,200
We all saw the thing.

345
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,960
We all saw the guy get zapped.

346
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,840
You saw something.

347
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,080
At least, you thought you did.

348
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,280
- And what about you, son?
- Me?

349
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,800
Yeah. What did you see?

350
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,560
I saw the same...

351
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,280
Same as they saw.

352
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,800
Well, that's quite a story.

353
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,960
Yeah, well,

354
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,440
I think it's about time to get out of here.
What do you boys think?

355
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,360
You're real broken up about
your missing buddy, aren't you?

356
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,280
Oh, that's very perceptive.

357
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,200
- That's because he's not my friend.
- I got that.

358
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,240
- Clearly.
- Did you?

359
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,720
Good. Now, are you done?

360
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,240
We'll tell you when.

361
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,280
I don't want anybody to leave
till I get

362
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,720
everybody's phone number
and address.

363
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,520
- Shouldn't we try to find him?
- This is a...

364
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,400
He's not on the mountain,
remember?

365
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,240
They took him.

366
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,960
Well, what do you think?
Think we ought to head up there?

367
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,400
Too late. Not enough men.
We'll head out in the morning.

368
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,960
Well, Dallis, you sure can talk.

369
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,880
See, I told you he wasn't
gonna believe your damn story.

370
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,120
Not a goddamn word of it.

371
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,760
Looks like they were
working on it there.

372
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,800
Boy, that truck looks like
it's been to hell and back.

373
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,240
Well, the sun comes up
at 6 in the morning.

374
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,920
We got 50 men, jeeps, horses, dogs.

375
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,160
I wanna call Flagstaff
and get two helicopters.

376
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,840
- That be enough?
- That's plenty.

377
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,360
My hunch is, tomorrow
we'll find Travis Walton.

378
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,960
Of course, I'd be surprised
if we found him in one piece.

379
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,560
Yeah.

380
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,440
You recommend a good motel,
sheriff?

381
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,240
Yeah. Chapparal.

382
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,800
Just after you get inside
to Snowflake,

383
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,920
right there by the water tower.

384
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,200
Still, you have to wonder
how those boys

385
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,080
came up with such a crazy story.

386
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,640
Yeah.

387
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,240
Back on Earth,
we're dealing with a murder.

388
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,520
Plain and simple.

389
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,120
Good night, sheriff.

390
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,320
Good night, Frank.

391
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,760
<i>An Agriculture Department</i>
<i>spokesman acknowledged that...</i>

392
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:00,000
It's all over the radio. They're making
it out to be a big joke or something.

393
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,360
It's no joke.

394
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,800
You left him there?

395
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,000
I don't know where he is, Dana.

396
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,760
What do you mean,
you don't know where he is?

397
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,800
Just what I said.

398
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,000
Well, how could you just
leave him out there?

399
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,120
The radio was saying something
about outer space.

400
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,040
I didn't just leave him.

401
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,240
And, yeah, there was
something out there, Kate. I...

402
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,840
I... I don't understand. "Out there"?

403
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,000
Is Travis gone?

404
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,200
They're gonna send out
a search party for him tomorrow.

405
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,160
Where is he, Mike?

406
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:48,440
Where is he, Mike?
Where is he, Mike? Mike...

407
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,040
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

408
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,240
It'll be all right.

409
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,440
My Father in heaven,
I humbly bow before you.

410
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,400
I ask for your spirit to be with me.

411
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,600
Forgive us, Father,
for what we've done.

412
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,880
I want two-man teams on that ridge.

413
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,600
If that boy's out here,
I wanna find him.

414
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,720
- You got it?
- I got it.

415
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,640
Let's get going, boys.
And God bless you.

416
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,280
You're certain. This is the spot.

417
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,120
I mean, it was night, but...
But, yeah.

418
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,240
Here. It was right here.
This is exactly where he fell.

419
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,960
You said there was
an obvious depression.

420
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,480
That we could see it clearly.

421
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,880
This is it, right here.

422
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,760
Now, where the hell was it?
Was it over there, was it over here?

423
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,320
What are we doing, playing games?

424
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,920
I'm not sure.

425
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,840
I see.

426
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,200
He doesn't believe us.

427
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,840
Where's my brother, Mike?

428
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,400
- What'd you guys do with him?
- Look, Dan, take it easy.

429
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,160
- Back off, Whitlock.
- Hey, we're gonna find him, Dan.

430
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,280
Which one of you is Allan Dallis?

431
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,880
He's not here.

432
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,280
- What about him?
- I did some checking.

433
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,120
Your hired hand's got himself
a nice little criminal record.

434
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,360
Assault with a deadly weapon.

435
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:51,160
Listen, Mike, if anything
happened to my baby bro,

436
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,480
I'm holding you personally responsible.
You got that?

437
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,440
Yeah.

438
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,640
Give me a break. I came up here
to earn some money, man.

439
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,120
Now I might go to prison.

440
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,040
Well, maybe it's God's way
of punishing us, Bobby.

441
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,440
Spare me the God talk,
okay, David?

442
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,960
Hey, even if you don't
believe in him,

443
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,840
you know the difference
between right and wrong.

444
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,440
We all do. We got no excuses.

445
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,040
What?

446
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,240
What is that?

447
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,760
Apache reservation starts
right up there. Right there.

448
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,320
Hey, we got something over here!

449
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,560
- Find anything yet?
- I don't know.

450
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,320
Wonder what they'll find in there.

451
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,160
You got any ideas, Mike?

452
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,120
There's something here, sheriff.

453
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,760
- Is it Walton?
- It's him.

454
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,520
- I knew it.
- They killed him.

455
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,280
What is it?

456
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,160
Quit digging.

457
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,040
It ain't human, Frank.

458
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,160
Some hunter buried his dog.

459
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,160
I thought that was him.

460
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,880
Dana's staying over
at the Waltons' house.

461
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,720
Some guy from the A.L.I.
Called today.

462
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,600
They've taken you off the contract
and hired a whole new crew.

463
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,840
You don't seem too surprised.

464
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,280
I'm not.

465
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,400
Well, why aren't you?

466
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,440
What are we gonna do
for a paycheck next week?

467
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,920
Look, I'll figure it out, all right?

468
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,120
You know, I don't get this.
My best friend has disappeared.

469
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,360
God knows where he is,
and all you can think about is money.

470
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,880
I'll tell you something else.

471
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,960
People in this town are saying
terrible things about you.

472
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,480
- Well, I don't care what they think.
- Well, I do.

473
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,840
We live here, our kids live here.
Of course I care, and so should you.

474
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,520
- Mommy.
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

475
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,080
You know what? Listen,
why don't you go back to bed,

476
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,080
and I promise you
I'll read you that story.

477
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,800
I promise, okay? Okay.

478
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,280
Don't let those bedbugs bite.

479
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,640
What's she gonna say, huh?

480
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,880
When everybody says
her father's a liar or...

481
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,080
Go on, say it.

482
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,400
A liar or a murderer.

483
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,720
Including you?
Are you saying that, Kate?

484
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,040
No.

485
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,000
No. Of course not.

486
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,080
I just... Michael, I just want you
to tell me

487
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,400
what really happened up there.

488
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,640
I told you what happened.

489
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,040
I told you all I know.

490
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,880
You believe me, don't you, Kate?

491
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,200
You do believe me?

492
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:47,440
<i>Hello. Yes, this is 51098,</i>
<i>what is it?</i>

493
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,800
<i>This is Western Union.</i>

494
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,640
You know, Mike, the word's out.

495
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,160
Well, what word
would that be, Tom?

496
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,360
Oh, I don't know, it's just that

497
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,360
I been getting calls all day
from here to Timbuktu.

498
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,160
As of tomorrow, I'm all booked up.

499
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,040
- Well, who's calling?
- Reporters, sightseers,

500
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,520
UFO buffs and the like.

501
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,560
Hey, Mike,
what's really going on here?

502
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,240
- Can you keep a secret, Tom?
- You bet.

503
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,760
Don't tell anyone I'm here.

504
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,520
Mr. Rogers. Mr. Rogers.

505
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,920
You know, I feel like asking you

506
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,320
if it's a beautiful day
in your neighborhood.

507
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,360
Ray Melendez,
Action News, Phoenix.

508
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,320
- Look, I just woke up.
- Oh, that's no problem.

509
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,880
I just need to ask you a few questions.
What do you say, huh?

510
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,440
I've got nothing to say.

511
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,840
Well, see, I figured that you'd wanna,
like, you know,

512
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,720
set the record straight.

513
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,680
What with, you know,
everything that's being said

514
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,040
about you and all, you know...

515
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,560
Well, you figured wrong.

516
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,000
It's for your own...
It's for your own good, you know.

517
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,320
Just talk to the people.
Let them know what really happened.

518
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,320
What do you say? Come on.

519
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,000
- Hey, you guys, I think it's him.
- Is that him?

520
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,080
I think so.

521
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,080
Mike Rogers. Excuse me.
Mr. Rogers.

522
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,840
Mr. Whitlock. I'm Jarvis Powell,
from A.F.A.R.

523
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,200
We have had a lot of experience
in these matters,

524
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,720
and I think we might be able
to help each other out.

525
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,520
Well, we just wanted
to let you know that

526
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,080
there are those of us out there
who know the truth.

527
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,440
Now he's talking to this other guy.

528
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,880
Go on.

529
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,920
Please, give us a call
if we can be of service.

530
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,640
Let's go.

531
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,600
Anytime.

532
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,320
- How much do I owe you, Earl?
- Two dollars.

533
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,320
<i>Seventy-one, 65...</i>

534
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,720
Betty.

535
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,880
Yeah, I know. These boys know more
than they're telling.

536
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,760
What the heck's that lowlife
Buck Morton staring at?

537
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,840
He keeps looking over here.

538
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,600
Mike, this town's gone nuts.
Everything's crazy.

539
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,720
Yeah, I can see that,
now that we're TV news.

540
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,160
They're going up
to look for Travis again.

541
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,560
They won't find anything.

542
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:57,920
Watters come by at 6 in the morning,
he starts asking us all these questions.

543
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,240
He's all over us, man.

544
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,080
- Yeah, he said if we cooperated...
- Come on.

545
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,000
- If we confess.
- Confess?

546
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,480
Yeah. Yeah, if we confess,
he's gonna try to help us out.

547
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,560
Help us.

548
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,360
What the hell's going on
around here?

549
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,160
You got something
you wanna say to me?

550
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,480
Go sit down, Buck.

551
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,720
Hot food, coming through.

552
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,040
You boys wanna remedy this,
we can step outside right now.

553
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,240
You gotta be kidding me,
you fat piece of shit.

554
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,960
- You little son of a bitch.
- Get off of me! Get off!

555
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,160
- Come on.
- Calm down!

556
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,720
Come on, calm down.

557
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,040
Come on.

558
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,720
Back away there and let Miss Ida
through with that food, will you?

559
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,200
God almighty.

560
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,120
Get over there and drink that coffee
before it gets cold, boy.

561
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,640
How you boys running today?

562
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,040
- Anything, Mike?
- How's my boy?

563
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,200
No. Thanks, Ida.

564
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,000
Sit down, David, sit down.

565
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,160
Cool down, fellas.

566
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,720
Listen, fellas, I want you all to know

567
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,840
that there's not a damn thing
personal in this.

568
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,880
Now, where's your friend?

569
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,960
- Which one?
- Come on, Mike.

570
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,280
The one with the attitude.

571
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,040
Well, if you mean Dallis,
I don't know.

572
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,200
We got a proposition for y'all.

573
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,120
I want you to take
a lie-detector test.

574
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,760
If you're telling the truth,
it'll sure strengthen your cause.

575
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,120
We'll think about it.

576
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,760
I got a good man
right here in the state.

577
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,520
I mean, you could take it today,
tomorrow, any time that y'all feel...

578
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,760
I said, we'll think about it.

579
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,400
Why don't we have a little talk,
Mike, huh?

580
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,200
Outside.

581
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,920
Young Greg told us the truth
about the cut on Dallis' hand.

582
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,880
It wasn't a paper cut, was it?

583
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,200
He had an altercation with Travis
on the day of the disappearance.

584
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,400
Isn't that true?

585
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,240
I guess.

586
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,960
I think you're starting to get
a pretty good feel

587
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,480
for who I am, Rogers.

588
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,960
I've been at this line of work
for a long time.

589
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,040
You know what's starting to bug me?

590
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:27,560
I think maybe
you didn't kill your friend.

591
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,040
But for the life of me,

592
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,120
I can't figure why you're covering up.

593
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:44,320
- What the heck's he want?
- I don't know. Let's go.

594
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,680
- Where we going?
- To find Dallis.

595
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,880
Dallis? I thought you don't know
where he is.

596
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,680
I lied.

597
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:01,360
All right, I'm gonna raise you 10
on this. I'm gonna raise you...

598
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,640
Guys, just speak American, please.

599
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,080
Well, fellas.

600
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,320
Well?

601
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,520
I heard what's been happening in
that stupid little Mormon town of yours.

602
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,080
I told you chuckleheads that story
was never gonna work, didn't I?

603
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,640
Yeah, well, you know they took away
our logging contract, Dallis?

604
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,160
Do you know that, huh?

605
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,920
Well, that figures. They're a bunch
of chickenshit assholes.

606
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,000
Yeah, well, speaking of chickenshit,

607
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,000
where you been?

608
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,640
I been around.

609
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,680
You knew where to find me,
didn't you, Mike?

610
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,280
Davis and Watters
are looking for you, Dallis.

611
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,160
They know about
your criminal record.

612
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,080
They know you lied
about how you hurt your hand.

613
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,680
- They know you're full of it...
- You're full of information today,

614
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,920
- aren't you, choirboy?
- Well, it don't make us look good

615
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:22,880
- when you don't show up. No, it don't!
- Well, that's too goddamn bad!

616
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,240
They want us to take
a lie-detector test.

617
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,600
I wanna know
what you think about it.

618
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,520
You wanna know
what I think about it?

619
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,360
That's right.

620
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,720
I'll tell you what I think.

621
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:42,160
I think those devices
are very dangerous, man.

622
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,560
That machine says you lied,

623
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,760
it don't matter if you
told the truth, you lied.

624
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,040
It might clear us, though.

625
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,200
Oh, it might clear you.

626
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,280
You know,

627
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,560
they don't need a body
to press murder charges,

628
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,880
did you know that?
Did you know that, huh?

629
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,920
And they ain't never gonna find Travis.
You know that and I know it, right?

630
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:12,160
So then the pressure's gonna be on
Davis and Watters to solve the case.

631
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,320
And who do you think
they're gonna zero in on, huh?

632
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,720
What, you, choirboy?

633
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,520
And God'll send
a swarm of locusts down on them.

634
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,440
And you,
Mr. Pillar-of-the-Community?

635
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,360
No, I don't think so.

636
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,240
No, the question is,

637
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,920
how long before you boys decide
to save your lily-white asses

638
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,360
and point the finger at me?

639
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,320
- That's a load of crud...
- No, that's exactly

640
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,560
- the way it's gonna be!
- That's a load!

641
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:39,400
If we decide to take
this lie-detector test,

642
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,240
we all take it.

643
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,000
Don't you point your finger at me.

644
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,640
All right, Mike. Come on!

645
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,760
All right! All right!

646
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,600
All right. Go.

647
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,720
- Get away from me.
- All right, Dallis, you just be there.

648
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,120
That was nice, that felt good.

649
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,720
Just be there.

650
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,720
Be there.

651
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:16,520
<i>The story has drawn</i>

660

<i>The White Mountains.</i>

661

672
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,280
<i>What really did happen that night,</i>

673
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,320

677

678
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,320
"Ray Melendez", "Action News".

679
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,600
<i>Thanks, Ray. In other news...</i>

680
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:37,960
Sheriff, we've been
combing those woods for days now.

681
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,920
The town's getting a bad name.

682
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:43,480
My kids are scared
from all this silly UFO nonsense...

683
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,000
...and all these strangers
wandering around asking questions.

684
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,760
What are you
gonna do about it, sheriff?

685
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:49,880
Yes, ma'am.

686
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,640
Miss Sarah, everybody's
awful concerned about this.

687
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,600
Nobody's more concerned
than me and my men.

688
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,240
They're working 24 hours a day
on this matter.

689
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,760
We wanna get back to normal
in this town, if we can.

690
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,600
One thing I want you to know,
we've asked those young men

691
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,840
to take a lie-detector test.

692
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:07,800
And they flatly refused.

693
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,880
What good's that gonna do,
anyhow?

694
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,440
Now, if there's been foul play,
we need to know now

695
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,520
that our town is safe to live in.

696
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,040
And why haven't you made
any arrests?

697
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,120
Come on, Nate, think it through.

698
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,400
There's not one scintilla of evidence

699
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,440
that a crime's even been committed.

700
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,360
Everybody's got a pretty good idea
what really happened.

701
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:30,480
Hey, hold it.
You just hold it right there.

702
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,280
What are you people trying to say?

703
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:44,800
What are you saying, George?

704
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,160
Are you saying I killed
Travis Walton?

705
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,680
You really disappoint me.

706
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,240
I went to school with you, Nate.

707
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,280
My Mary, she's at school
with your kids.

708
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,840
Jack, Larry,

709
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,120
Mrs. Pratt.

710
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,120
What are you doing?

711
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,720
I miss Travis.

712
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:19,200
Just like you. I miss him bad.

713
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,360
But I... I can't help what happened.

714
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,160
I... I can't change what I saw.

715
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,800
I wish I could.

716
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,200
I wish... I wish we had him back.

717
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:35,200
I... I wish I knew...
I wish I knew he was okay.

718
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,440
But that's out of my hands.

719
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,440
And so is what you think of me.

720
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:48,960
We've been telling you the truth
since the beginning.

721
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,480
And now we're ready to prove it.

722
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,480
We'll take your damn
lie-detector test.

723
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:56,800
You set it up, we'll be there.
You go ahead.

724
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:02,520
And if any of you got anything to say
about me or my crew,

725
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,640
you say it now,
and you say it to my face.

726
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,120
Mike, whose idea
was the lie-detector test?

727
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,440
Was that yours or the sheriff's?

728
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,160
- Did you kill Travis?
- Did you really see aliens up there?

729
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,440
- If you killed Travis Walton...
- Give him some room.

730
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:04,240
Give him some room.
Back off, back off.

731
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,720
You were told to be here at 9:00.

732
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,880
Yeah, well, we weren't.

733
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,400
Fellas, meet Cy Gilson.

734
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:19,440
Came all the way from Phoenix
to be sure that you get a good test.

735
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,800
Yeah, and how do we know that?

736
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,160
I guarantee it.

737
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,320
Words are cheap.

738
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:28,000
Yeah, you say the test will be good.
How do we know it's gonna be fair?

739
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,720
I give my word.

740
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,080
We can't trust anyone, man.

741
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,960
Everything we say
has been twisted all to hell.

742
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,080
That's for sure.
This whole town wants to see us fall,

743
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,680
Blake, you know that.

744
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,680
Frankly, I don't care
whether you pass or not.

745
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,680
If you're lying,
my machine will show it.

746
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:46,160
If you're clean, it'll show that too.

747
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,800
How do we know
you ain't been bought off

748
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,800
to make us look bad?

749
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:52,320
Cy Gilson is the best there is, boys.

750
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,680
You're lucky to have him.

751
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:58,720
Well, if you say so,
that's good enough for me.

752
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,200
Point is, you can trust him.

753
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,040
Yeah, well, I trust you, Blake.

754
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,640
Will you give us your word
this test will be fair?

755
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,240
That's easy. You got it.

756
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,880
All right.

757
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,400
Is your name
Gregory Thomas Hayes?

758
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,320
Yes.

759
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,960
Were you born in Corona,
New Mexico?

760
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,000
Yes.

761
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,760
Are you currently single?

762
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,760
Yes.

763
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,680
Is my shirt white?

764
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,360
Face around front.

765
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,560
- Some of it's white.
- Yes or no.

766
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,640
No.

767
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,040
Five days ago, about sundown,
on Rim Road, north of Turkey Creek,

768
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:01,120
did you see an unidentified light
just above the tree line?

769
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,240
Yes.

770
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,240
Did you see an object hovering
above the clearing?

771
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,040
Yes.

772
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,800
Was it saucer-shaped?

773
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,680
Sort of.

774
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:20,000
I don't... I don't... I never seen
anything exactly like it before.

775
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,880
Yes or no?

776
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,360
I'd have to say no.

777
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:33,040
Did you see Travis Walton
approach the object on foot?

778
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,040
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

779
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,720
Did you see a bolt of blue-green light
envelop Travis Walton?

780
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:44,960
Yeah. Man, I told them.
It exploded all around him.

781
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,520
Did you believe Travis was killed
by the ray of light?

782
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,200
Now, how do I know?

783
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,000
I just know that I didn't kill him.

784
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,560
Did you personally dislike
Travis Walton?

785
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,040
Now, what kind of question is that?

786
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:04,400
A simple yes or no will do.

787
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,440
Yes.

788
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,280
And no.

789
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,760
Have you withheld
any pertinent information

790
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:21,240
regarding the disappearance
of Travis Walton?

791
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,600
No.

792
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:30,720
Did you create this incident
to get out of your logging contract?

793
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,120
No.

794
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:39,840
Did you or any of your crew
murder Travis Walton?

795
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,640
Absolutely not.

796
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,080
Well, what's the word?

797
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:14,920
Well, the results of one of the tests
was unusual.

798
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:18,680
It was inconclusive.
We'll have to try again tomorrow.

799
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,360
What about the other ones?
What's the word on them?

800
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:24,760
The process is still ongoing.

801
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:28,480
We never discuss the results
till all the testing is complete.

802
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:29,920
Sorry, fellas.

803
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,160
Come back down here
in the morning, 9:00 sharp.

804
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,360
- No.
- What?

805
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:37,320
I said, no.

806
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,040
Look, we did what we said we'd do.

807
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:42,080
We... We... We came in here
like guinea pigs and let you test us.

808
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,120
But that's it. That...
We've had enough.

809
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,840
I ain't coming back again.

810
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,560
You're saying that you're no longer
willing to cooperate?

811
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,080
That's all we do, is cooperate.

812
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,280
And all we get back
from you is grief.

813
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,720
- Mike, we need a little bit of time...
- No!

814
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,440
Blake, I'm sick of this shit!

815
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:03,040
You wanna press charges?
You go ahead. You do it now!

816
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,200
We told you everything we know.

817
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,600
And if that's not good enough,
that's too damn bad,

818
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,160
because that's all there is.

819
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,280
Let's get the hell out of here.

820
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,920
Well, Dallis' chart was
all over the place.

821
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:30,240
He must have been really keyed up
or scared or whatever.

822
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:33,480
It's unreadable.
Completely unreadable.

823
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:37,720
As for the other four, see for yourself.
They're pretty much all the same.

824
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,960
What are you saying, Cy?

825
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:44,280
Well, Blake, my charts don't lie.

826
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:48,080
You ask me,
those boys are telling the truth.

827
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,560
Do you plan on spending the night?

828
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:47,840
Yeah. I was thinking about it.

829
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,920
Why, is that gonna be a problem?

830
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,360
No. Do whatever you want.

831
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:02,320
Hello?

832
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:06,200
Whoever's doing this, it's not funny.

833
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:10,040
I can't believe this.
Another crank call.

834
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:11,760
We've been getting
two and three in the day.

835
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,760
Now we're getting them
at all hours of the night.

836
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,840
Now, let me get that.

837
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:29,680
Yeah, who is this?

838
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,920
<i>I have a collect call</i>
<i>from Travis Walton.</i>

839
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:35,640
- "Will you accept the charges?"
- You know, just hang up the phone.

840
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:38,600
- I'll accept it.
- "Go ahead, sir."

841
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:40,520
<i>Mike.</i>

842
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,000
Travis?

843
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,040
<i>Help me.</i>

844
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,240
I've been through Heber
a bunch of times.

845
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:53,920
I don't remember any phone booth.

846
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:57,280
Well, he said he was calling
from a gas station or something.

847
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,640
Are you sure it was him?

848
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,160
What's that over there?

849
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:31,000
Mike, I think this just might be
someone's idea of a sick joke.

850
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,080
Wait a minute,
there's a gas station north of here.

851
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,120
- I don't think so, Mike.
- About eight or nine miles.

852
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:38,000
I know so.

853
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:53,440
Well, you were right
about the gas station at least.

854
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,840
I know that was Travis.
It sounded just like him.

855
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,200
Stop. Wait. What is that?

856
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,920
Stop, Mike. What is that?
Right there. Stop!

857
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:05,480
Pull over, Mike! Pull over!

858
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:17,360
- David, grab that flashlight.
- Got it.

859
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,680
Travis? It's him!

860
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:22,960
- Travis! Travis, are you okay?
- Travis!

861
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:25,680
Travis?

862
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:27,720
- Travis?
- Travis, it's us.

863
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:30,120
- Hey, man.
- Travis, what's wrong?

864
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:31,880
- Hey, baby bro.
- Hey, Travis, it's Mike.

865
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,000
Hey, it's your partner,
you remember me?

866
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:39,040
Travis, your partner.
MT Motors. Harleys.

867
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:41,120
You cold, man?

868
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,520
Take it easy, bro. Take it easy.

869
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,440
Don't try to talk, man.

870
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,640
Travis.

871
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,880
Water! Water!
Somebody get him some water!

872
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:55,480
- Hey, man, it's gonna be okay.
- Water.

873
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:58,240
Everything's gonna be
all right, Travis.

874
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,560
Hey, Dana's right here.

875
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:03,520
Travis. Travis.

876
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,840
Travis, it's okay.

877
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:25,920
This must be them.

878
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,320
They're here.

879
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,240
Mike...

880
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:42,880
Mike?

881
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,600
Five days, man.

882
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,160
It's been five days.

883
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:52,520
Travis, everybody's been looking
for you.

884
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:54,680
- Hundreds of people.
- Come on, hurry up.

885
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,520
I think a lot of prayers
have been answered.

886
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:59,840
I can't believe we found this place.
Where is he?

887
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,920
We're gonna need a urine sample.

888
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,360
Urine sample?

889
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,520
Mike, don't let them touch him.

890
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,000
- Back off.
- It's okay.

891
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,480
Back off, man. He knows his stuff.

892
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,560
It's a wise thing you called.
This is a very critical time.

893
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:14,400
Hey, come on in here. Get a picture.
Get some pictures here. Pictures.

894
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,120
Mr. Walton?

895
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:21,000
Mr. Walton, my name
is Jarvis Powell.

896
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:24,400
Now, can you...? Can you tell us
how long you've been back?

897
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,320
- Let him.
- Here, get this thing started.

898
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,440
Hey, we need to get him to a hospital!

899
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,160
- Quiet, please.
- Dan! Calm down, man.

900
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:32,640
- Mr. Walton.
- Calm down, man!

901
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:35,240
Mr. Walton. Mr. Walton. Back up.

902
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:38,080
Mr. Walton, did you make contact
with aliens?

903
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:41,600
Were you taken to another planet?
To a mother ship?

904
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:44,960
- How did they communicate with you?
- Just stop it! Just leave him alone.

905
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,960
Communicate? What is this
man-in-the-moon stuff?

906
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,480
Okay, look, you've got two choices.

907
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:50,320
You can either be quiet
or step outside.

908
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,160
Dana, give this guy a chance.

909
01:08:56,320 --> 01:09:00,080
Mr. Walton, can you tell me
what they look like?

910
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:03,200
Can you tell me how many
of them there were?

911
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:06,080
Were you...?
Were you given food? Injections?

912
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:08,560
- All right, that's enough, mister.
- Mike.

913
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:11,160
It's important the entire world
learns of your experience.

914
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,720
That's enough, Mike. Come on!

915
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,200
Look, I am asking you...

916
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:16,320
I'm asking all of you,
just let us do our job!

917
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:18,240
No! You have done your thing.
He's not answering.

918
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,640
You can't come between me
and my brother!

919
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,160
Get out of here! No, no...
He's seeing something!

920
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:26,560
He's seeing something!

921
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:29,600
Travis, what do you see?
What do you see?!

922
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:31,640
- Get him out of here!
- He sees something!

923
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,400
He's seeing something!

924
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,800
All right, here we go. Ready? Lift.

925
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:48,240
Okay, let's go, guys.

926
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,840
The doctor's down in ICU.
We'll page him.

927
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:54,240
Hang in there, pal.
You're gonna be fine.

928
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:03,200
He's rolling the eyes a little bit.
Better watch him.

929
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:05,000
You're gonna be okay.

930
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:10,360
I wonder what happened to this one.

931
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:12,480
Okay, watch the corner.

932
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:30,880
Lab tech's on the way, doctor.

933
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,080
Secure it.

934
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:40,280
- Did he lose consciousness?
- No, he didn't.

935
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,160
- Pulse?
- Are you okay?

936
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,760
Hey, can you talk to me?

937
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,160
Hey, man, how you doing?

938
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:31,120
Hey, I'm not supposed
to be in here.

939
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,840
Your ma's out front.
She can't wait to see you.

940
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,040
But they said we weren't
supposed to be coming in here.

941
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:41,200
I guess they don't think
you're ready to see visitors yet.

942
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,720
Boy, was I glad you showed up.

943
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:52,120
I really missed you, buddy.

944
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,080
You know, they had a search party
out for you for days.

945
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,040
They thought...

946
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:00,040
They thought that
we had killed you, man.

947
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,640
They were ready to lynch us.

948
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,360
Can you imagine that?

949
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,720
These jerks actually thought
we killed you.

950
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,360
Kate and I aren't doing so good.

951
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:21,320
Not that we were ever doing
that great, but...

952
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,480
I don't think we're gonna make it.

953
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:26,000
But Dana, she sure loves you.

954
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:28,720
She's been a basket case.

955
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,320
I was pretty broken up too.

956
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:41,280
When I came back up there
and you were gone...

957
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,840
...I can't tell you how awful I felt.

958
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,440
What?

959
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:06,920
When you came back?

960
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,080
Travis, we thought you were dead.

961
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:15,720
I mean, it blasted you with the light.

962
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:17,440
And the guys, they got all scared,

963
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,480
and they started hollering
and everything and...

964
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,840
You left me there.

965
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:27,160
Well, come on, Travis.

966
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,400
I mean, what did you expect
me to do?

967
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:31,680
I came right back for you.

968
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,600
You son of a bitch.

969
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,800
If you hadn't gotten out of the truck
in the first place,

970
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:50,200
none of this would've happened.

971
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,960
No one is allowed in here.

972
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:58,960
Yeah, I was just leaving.

973
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,480
You know, Travis, I believe you.

974
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:30,680
And I know we'd have a lot
to talk about.

975
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,800
Maybe one day we'll have
a two-way conversation.

976
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:34,920
Just you and me.

977
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,760
- Thanks, Dr. Cayle.
- I really mean it, Travis.

978
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,960
If you need me, please call.
I'm here for you.

979
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:42,520
You can always find me here.
Remember that.

980
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:44,040
Good luck.

981
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,120
- Bye.
- Bye.

982
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:47,480
Look, here he comes.

983
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:49,960
Mr. Walton, please give me a
statement about your UFO experience.

984
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:51,880
Give me a statement.
Just take some time, please.

985
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:54,480
- Tell us what you saw.
- What happened up there, exactly?

986
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,840
Mr. Walton, is this some kind of
hoax that got out of hand?

987
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:59,200
Give us a statement.

988
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,000
Travis, get in the car
and lock the door.

989
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,520
Come on, why don't you come clean
about where you disappeared to.

990
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:05,880
What is this rumor about drugs
being involved? Is that true?

991
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:08,120
Travis? Please.

992
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,080
Come on, look over here.

993
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,520
He's not answering questions today.

994
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,040
- Travis, can we have your autograph?
- Autograph?

995
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:47,520
Yeah, you're famous.
You've been to space.

996
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:02,920
- Gee, thanks.
- Cool.

997
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,600
Autographs.

998
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,200
You've become quite the celebrity.

999
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:10,560
You enjoying it?

1000
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:15,320
Word is, the tabloids are gonna

1001
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:18,120
put up quite a hunk of cash
for your story rights.

1002
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,800
You've hit the big time.
Congratulations.

1003
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,160
Who are you?

1004
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:26,080
Frank Watters,
state investigator for the CIB.

1005
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:28,960
I've been on the case
since you disappeared.

1006
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:32,480
Where you been the last five days?

1007
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,560
L... I can't remember.

1008
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:40,280
Dr. Wilson over at
the hospital tells me

1009
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:44,080
you went without food and water
all that time.

1010
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:46,400
Was it worth it?

1011
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:49,280
I don't know what you're talking about.

1012
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,280
You don't, huh?

1013
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:55,840
Well, I can see your memory
isn't quite there yet.

1014
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,560
So, what do you say we just give it
a little more time, huh?

1015
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:04,640
I'm a patient man.
I'm not going anywhere.

1016
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:07,400
You decide you got
something to tell me,

1017
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,360
I can be reached through
the sheriff's office.

1018
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:15,080
Oh, welcome home, Travis.

1019
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:17,120
Good day, ma'am.

1020
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:25,120
What was that all about?

1021
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:30,040
Take me home. Please.

1022
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:38,360
- Hey, hey! Look who I found outside!
- Hey!

1023
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:44,440
Good to see you. Good to see you.

1024
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,960
- Yeah, it's good to have you back.
- Good to see you, Travis.

1025
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:50,720
I'm sorry, but, well, Mike's
probably not coming.

1026
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,080
Hey, Travis, man, look at this.

1027
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:55,320
We made the paper.

1028
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,080
Frank Watters was on the radio
this morning.

1029
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:00,360
Now he's saying polygraphs
are inconclusive.

1030
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:01,960
He thinks we're all lying.

1031
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:04,400
I bet Watters still thinks we killed you.

1032
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:12,440
You all right, guy?

1033
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:17,240
Everybody, come on, let's eat.
Everything's all ready.

1034
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:18,560
Let's eat.

1035
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:20,880
I bet you're hot and tired
of that hospital food, huh?

1036
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:22,680
Let's get some food.

1037
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,400
Come on, Travis.

1038
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,160
Come on, Trav,
let's get some chow.

1039
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,480
Whoa, watch it, there!

1040
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,880
Let me get you some fruit cocktail.

1041
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:46,120
Okay, Nancy, do you want
some of this?

1042
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:49,320
There's turkey there and cranberries.
Get yourself in here and get some.

1043
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,800
Where's Travis?

1044
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,720
Oh, okay. I'll talk to him.

1045
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:00,160
- Pretty good grub.
- Travis?

1046
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,520
Travis?

1047
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,200
Travis?

1048
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,120
Honey?

1049
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:24,920
Travis? Travis?

1050
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:26,280
What's going on?

1051
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:30,040
Travis, what's wrong? Travis?

1052
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:31,960
Travis, are you okay?

1053
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:34,360
Travis, what's wrong?

1054
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,160
Travis? Travis? Travis?

1055
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:38,760
Travis! Travis!

1056
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:09,280
Space suits.

1057
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:31,920
It's Dr. Cayle, Travis.

1058
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:35,800
Your brother and Dana brought you
to my office. We're all here.

1059
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:39,760
I know how difficult this has been.

1060
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:45,280
Travis.

1061
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:49,160
Are you okay?

1062
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:51,960
I love you, honey.

1063
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:53,880
First unsolved case, Frank?

1064
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:56,080
Oh, I wouldn't say that,
exactly, sheriff.

1065
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:58,960
Just waiting for the real truth
to come out.

1066
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:01,120
Well, that doctor
seemed to think it was real.

1067
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:04,920
She's forgetting the fact that Travis
had five days to dream up

1068
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:07,760
and rehearse
this cockamamie story of his.

1069
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,720
What are you getting at, Frank?

1070
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:12,920
It just seems to me that this whole
thing is a very well-planned

1071
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,440
- and executed hoax.
- Hoax?

1072
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:18,240
For God's sake, why would
they wanna do that?

1073
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:21,000
To get some attention.
Could be as simple as that.

1074
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:24,920
- Oh, I don't know, Frank. I mean...
- Yeah, well, one of these days,

1075
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:28,480
they're gonna slip up. When they do,

1076
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:30,680
I'm on my way back to Snowflake.

1077
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:34,480
All the way from Montana?

1078
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:37,760
From the frigging North Pole
if I have to.

1079
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,640
I'll see you then, sheriff.

1080
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:09,640
Aren't you gonna be late for work?

1081
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:13,840
What?

1082
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:18,680
No. We're gonna have breakfast now.
We can't play ball anymore.

1083
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:21,160
Come on, get your legs
in there, Michael.

1084
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:25,080
Okay. We'll leave the ball here.
But you have some cereal, okay?

1085
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:32,240
- How's my girl?
- Okay. You gotta go to work.

1086
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,520
- Yeah. I'll see you.
- Okay.

1087
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:37,520
Bye, sweetheart. Want to have
some juice?

1088
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:40,120
Yeah, you gotta have your juice
and cereal. Say, "Bye-bye, Daddy."

1089
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:41,560
Bye-bye, Daddy.

1090
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:43,400
- Bye-bye.
- Yeah.

1091
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:28,200
Mike?

1092
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,520
Travis.

1093
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:54,080
You're looking good.

1094
01:35:57,640 --> 01:35:59,720
Hey, I heard you moved up here.

1095
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:03,480
Been a long time.
What is it, two years?

1096
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,400
It's two and a half.

1097
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,400
We gotta talk.

1098
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:14,800
Well, what do we got to talk about?

1099
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:18,680
Come on, Mike. Let's go for a ride.

1100
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:04,640
You wanna get out?

1101
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:10,800
Why did you bring me here?

1102
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:39,480
You know, I don't like this place much.

1103
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:43,320
Hey, Mike...

1104
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:45,960
...neither do I.

1105
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:49,840
In fact, I haven't had
a decent night's sleep since...

1106
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:52,920
Since I last saw you.

1107
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:56,440
Yeah, I know what you mean.

1108
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:58,280
So it bothers you too?

1109
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:01,960
What do you think?

1110
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:27,440
I saw your girls the other day.
They're getting big.

1111
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:33,480
They miss you.
Everybody misses you.

1112
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,280
You know, you're about
to be an uncle again.

1113
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:39,400
Again?

1114
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:41,440
You mean you never heard?

1115
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:44,760
Michael's almost 2
and Dana's three months gone.

1116
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,640
Michael?

1117
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:49,320
That's all right.

1118
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:56,800
So why are we up here, Travis?

1119
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:05,560
I've been doing a lot of thinking
about what happened.

1120
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:12,960
Hell, it was all my fault, Mike.
I never should've got out of the truck.

1121
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:17,920
Don't be ridiculous.
What happened happened.

1122
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:21,120
- We can't change that.
- Well...

1123
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:24,360
...whatever you did, it's okay.
Understand?

1124
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:26,520
It's cool.

1125
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:31,320
Same goes for you.

1126
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:46,280
Let's get going.
You gotta go to work and...

1127
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:48,600
And what?

1128
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:51,520
I'd like to get the hell out of here
before they come back.

1129
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:54,240
Oh, they won't be back.

1130
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:00,520
I don't think they liked me.
