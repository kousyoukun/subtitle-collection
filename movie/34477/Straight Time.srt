1
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:53,835
Open the gate.

2
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:01,534
You guys wanna step up to the table?

3
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,484
Open the gate, please.

4
00:03:23,887 --> 00:03:26,219
- Can I help you?
- A dog.

5
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:28,084
Everything on it?

6
00:03:44,574 --> 00:03:48,340
Hey. Hey. Sixty-five cents.

7
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,805
Mr. Frank, please.

8
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,584
No.

9
00:05:06,422 --> 00:05:10,756
Well, my name's Dembo, A-20284.

10
00:05:13,363 --> 00:05:16,764
Dembo, A-20284. Okay?

11
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:20,334
Just tell him that I'm here and I'll just...
I'll see him tomorrow morning.

12
00:05:20,503 --> 00:05:23,404
I got an appointment with him.
Nothing important.

13
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,541
Yeah, okay. Thank you.

14
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,735
- Hi, Max.
- Hi.

15
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:36,401
Earl Frank.

16
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:37,910
Come on in.

17
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:43,179
Have a seat.

18
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,623
- You're a little late.
- I had some trouble getting down here.

19
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,350
- Want a coffee?
- Yeah, thanks.

20
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,255
Black.

21
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:59,760
So fill me in. How was the trip?

22
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:03,167
On the bus down? It was a little long.

23
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:07,340
- We made about 27 stops.
- Yeah, it's a real milk train.

24
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,444
Go ahead. Put it down on the floor.

25
00:07:10,713 --> 00:07:12,476
So, what'd you do last night?

26
00:07:12,648 --> 00:07:14,582
Oh, walked around.

27
00:07:15,551 --> 00:07:18,247
- Meet anybody?
- No, nobody I know.

28
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:20,852
Where'd you stay?
You didn't go to the halfway house.

29
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,651
- I called. Didn't you get the message?
- You called here?

30
00:07:23,826 --> 00:07:26,624
Last night. I left a message
with your answering service.

31
00:07:26,796 --> 00:07:28,627
- I didn't get it.
- I left it.

32
00:07:28,798 --> 00:07:29,822
So where'd you sleep?

33
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,627
In a motel.

34
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:34,827
The conditions of your parole
were that you were to go to the house.

35
00:07:35,004 --> 00:07:36,665
That's a way to help you save money.

36
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,932
Now, you agreed to that
before your release.

37
00:07:39,108 --> 00:07:40,200
Why didn't you go there?

38
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,840
Because I just spent six years
in prison.

39
00:07:43,012 --> 00:07:46,175
I just wanted to look at the lights.
I wanted to feel free.

40
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:48,010
I wanted to walk around...

41
00:07:48,184 --> 00:07:51,585
...and not have somebody tell me
that I gotta get in bed at 10:00.

42
00:07:52,155 --> 00:07:55,352
Max, I think you've got
a serious attitude problem.

43
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,818
I don't have an attitude.

44
00:07:58,961 --> 00:08:02,556
Can you tell me what kind of attitude
you want me to have?

45
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:05,757
Well, you don't decide whether or not
you go to a halfway house.

46
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:08,768
I mean, you come to me,
we discuss it, then I decide.

47
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:13,803
I'm just trying to make you understand that
I'm aware of the realities of my situation...

48
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:17,104
...that I'm not fated
to be a menace to society.

49
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,780
I'm not gonna go out
and hit somebody over the head.

50
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,977
My friend, I see that you're gonna
force me to deal with you.

51
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:30,817
I see that you've got juvenile offenses
dating back to when you were 12.

52
00:08:30,993 --> 00:08:33,894
I see you've got auto theft,
you've got breaking and entering.

53
00:08:34,063 --> 00:08:35,997
All this leading up to
a burglary warrant.

54
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:38,463
I just served six years
for that chickenshit rap.

55
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:41,967
Chickenshit? You had a gun.

56
00:08:42,505 --> 00:08:45,065
Yeah, but I didn't use it
and I didn't hurt nobody.

57
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,576
What was in your mind
when you put it in your pocket?

58
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,684
I just took it along.

59
00:09:00,056 --> 00:09:02,115
I'm due in court.

60
00:09:02,758 --> 00:09:05,921
I'm aware that you have this power,
that you represent the state...

61
00:09:06,095 --> 00:09:08,996
...but, you know, I think that
you can give me a little leeway.

62
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:10,496
You can be flexible.

63
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,861
I was just hoping
to get some trust from you.

64
00:09:13,402 --> 00:09:15,427
You've gotta earn the trust.

65
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:19,005
I have. I just wanna
be like everybody else.

66
00:09:19,175 --> 00:09:22,633
I just want a decent job.
I want a decent place to live.

67
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,679
I want somebody to love me,
I want some clothes on my back...

68
00:09:25,881 --> 00:09:29,078
...have some self-respect.
- I gotta get going now.

69
00:09:29,285 --> 00:09:31,446
I tried to be straight with you, sir.

70
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:35,250
I know I shouldn't have done that last night
without checking with you first.

71
00:09:35,424 --> 00:09:36,652
I'm sorry.

72
00:09:41,797 --> 00:09:43,196
I'm sorry.

73
00:09:48,604 --> 00:09:50,367
I'll make a deal with you, Max.

74
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:53,736
If you find a place to sleep today
and a job by the end of the week...

75
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:56,241
...you don't have to go
to a halfway house. Fair?

76
00:09:56,545 --> 00:09:58,638
That's fair. I appreciate that.

77
00:09:58,814 --> 00:10:02,306
When you find a place, you call
Miss Deveccio and give her the address.

78
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:04,385
I'm gonna see you one day this week.

79
00:10:04,553 --> 00:10:05,781
That's okay.

80
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:08,355
Here's the other hundred
you've got coming to you.

81
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,890
I want you to sign for it.

82
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:15,062
Now, do you understand
the conditions of your parole?

83
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:17,699
- Yes, I do.
- You have to attend all meetings.

84
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:21,200
You must heed the advice
and the counsel of your agent.

85
00:10:22,071 --> 00:10:25,040
- Now, do you know what that means?
- Yeah, I think I do.

86
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:28,904
I gotta get along with you
or you're gonna throw me back in jail.

87
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:30,477
That's it in a nutshell.

88
00:10:30,646 --> 00:10:33,774
- You're a tough man.
- No, I'm not, Max.

89
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:35,911
All right, I gotta go now.

90
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,911
- Good luck with it, now, huh?
- Okay.

91
00:10:39,088 --> 00:10:40,953
I'm gonna do my best.

92
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,383
I know you're gonna do it.

93
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,170
- How much?
- Eighteen dollars a week.

94
00:11:39,482 --> 00:11:40,915
Okay.

95
00:11:54,363 --> 00:11:56,558
- Here's your key.
- Clean sheets?

96
00:11:56,732 --> 00:11:59,860
No. Bathroom is over there.

97
00:12:28,798 --> 00:12:30,163
Parole office. May I help you?

98
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,129
Could you leave a message
for Mr. Frank?

99
00:12:32,301 --> 00:12:37,398
- Who's calling?
- My name is Max Dembo, A-20284.

100
00:12:37,573 --> 00:12:39,803
- What?
- I got that.

101
00:12:39,975 --> 00:12:42,136
- A-20284.
- Thank you.

102
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:44,336
Could you tell him I'm
at the Garland Hotel?

103
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,879
That's G-A-R-L-A-N-D.

104
00:12:47,082 --> 00:12:50,848
And you'd better give him
the phone number. It's 321-1321.

105
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,478
- I'll give him the message.
- I'd appreciate it if he gets it today.

106
00:12:54,657 --> 00:12:58,286
- I'll give him the message, sir.
- Okay, thank you. Bye-bye.

107
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,590
Time's up.

108
00:13:35,798 --> 00:13:37,629
Time's up.

109
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:44,062
- Time's up. I'm sorry.
- I just wanted to finish that sentence.

110
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,140
Bring those score sheets.

111
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:52,447
You did great
on your intelligence test.

112
00:13:52,615 --> 00:13:55,140
Yeah, well, you know.
I could have told you that.

113
00:13:56,185 --> 00:13:57,209
One moment.

114
00:13:58,387 --> 00:14:00,378
Wilshire Agency.

115
00:14:00,623 --> 00:14:02,215
Yes, she is. Hold on.

116
00:14:02,391 --> 00:14:04,222
Pat, it's for you.

117
00:14:04,827 --> 00:14:07,387
- Did you put it on hold, honey?
- Yeah.

118
00:14:07,563 --> 00:14:08,621
Hello?

119
00:14:09,064 --> 00:14:11,760
Disconnected. I lost the call.

120
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:16,064
You're supposed to push down "Hold"
before you use these other buttons.

121
00:14:16,238 --> 00:14:19,696
- There's "Hold," there's the buttons.
- Okay.

122
00:14:20,476 --> 00:14:22,307
I'm sorry.

123
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,140
- Did you just get this job?
- Yeah. I've had it about a week.

124
00:14:28,651 --> 00:14:31,279
- Is she your boss?
- Yeah.

125
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:35,548
Does she really like you
as much as she seems to?

126
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:38,920
I guess. I don't know.

127
00:14:39,094 --> 00:14:42,086
You got a 61 on your typing test.

128
00:14:43,232 --> 00:14:45,962
- Is that bad?
- I'm afraid it's a little low.

129
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,932
Well, I'm not used to the electric.

130
00:14:49,905 --> 00:14:51,372
What was your last
place of employment?

131
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,804
Were you self-employed
or in the armed services?

132
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:58,705
No. I didn't know whether to put down
"state penitentiary."

133
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:04,385
I was a convict.

134
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,479
And how long
did you hold that position?

135
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:13,787
Approximately six years. No vacation.

136
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:17,826
What'd you do?

137
00:15:19,868 --> 00:15:21,392
Burglary.

138
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:26,505
You know, I know I fouled up
that typing test...

139
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,803
...but I do know how
to work a manual...

140
00:15:29,979 --> 00:15:33,471
...and if you get any calls
for a manual typist...

141
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:35,549
...I'd appreciate it, you know?

142
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:37,242
Well, I'll see what I can do.

143
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:39,148
All I wanna...

144
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,088
All I wanna do is get a job.

145
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,655
I need a fucking job.

146
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,962
I believe you.

147
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,838
Well, let me see.

148
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,065
I'm sorry to be a problem.

149
00:16:00,242 --> 00:16:02,836
You know, like I can't drive a car
without permission.

150
00:16:03,012 --> 00:16:05,480
- Why not?
- Well, it's a parole restriction.

151
00:16:05,648 --> 00:16:10,415
I can't handle money, you know,
and it's like I'm limited...

152
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:13,350
...in terms of what they allow me to do.

153
00:16:14,356 --> 00:16:16,119
Is there anything at all?

154
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,725
How about the National Can Company?

155
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:22,125
- Do you think they'd let you work there?
- Yeah.

156
00:16:22,464 --> 00:16:27,026
- I think that would be all right with them.
- It's not much. It's only scale.

157
00:16:27,202 --> 00:16:29,534
You wanna try? Okay.

158
00:16:29,705 --> 00:16:32,139
Let's see what we've got here.

159
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:35,543
Well, go here and see what they say.

160
00:16:39,682 --> 00:16:43,618
Listen, if I get this job,
can I celebrate by taking you to dinner?

161
00:16:45,554 --> 00:16:47,283
You're not sure?

162
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,952
Is that a half yes?

163
00:16:52,828 --> 00:16:54,489
I guess so.

164
00:16:55,464 --> 00:16:57,523
When you go there,
I hope you get the job.

165
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,327
- Thanks for your time.
- Good luck.

166
00:16:59,501 --> 00:17:02,595
- Thank you.
- Let me know what happens.

167
00:17:02,905 --> 00:17:04,304
Okay.

168
00:18:18,814 --> 00:18:21,749
- Hello? Who is it?
- Who is this?

169
00:18:21,917 --> 00:18:23,282
This is Henry Darin.

170
00:18:23,452 --> 00:18:25,886
- Henry Darin? I've heard about you.
- Yeah.

171
00:18:26,054 --> 00:18:27,954
- Is your daddy there?
- Yeah.

172
00:18:28,123 --> 00:18:31,650
Well, you tell him that somebody
wants to give the big bear a bear hug.

173
00:18:31,827 --> 00:18:33,158
- Who is it?
- Just tell him...

174
00:18:33,328 --> 00:18:36,320
...somebody wants to give the big bear
a bear hug. He'll know.

175
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:40,901
Dad! Someone wants to give you
a big-bear big bear hug!

176
00:18:44,273 --> 00:18:45,672
- Hello?
- Willy?

177
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:47,433
- Yeah?
- It's Max.

178
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:48,837
Dembo?

179
00:18:49,011 --> 00:18:50,842
- How you doing?
- Max, thank... Goddamn.

180
00:18:51,013 --> 00:18:52,412
- Is that your boy?
- Yeah.

181
00:18:52,581 --> 00:18:55,015
The last time you wrote,
he was learning how to walk.

182
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:56,845
Well, where the hell are you?

183
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:59,180
I got no wheels yet.
You wanna come get me?

184
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:00,651
Yes! Tell me where you are.

185
00:19:00,823 --> 00:19:03,314
Well, why don't I meet you
on 7th and Alvarado?

186
00:19:03,492 --> 00:19:05,722
- Lf I'm not there, wait for me, all right?
- Okay.

187
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,361
- You coming now?
- I'm coming now.

188
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:10,020
- Okay. I'll see you.
- Okay. Yeah.

189
00:19:26,181 --> 00:19:30,447
- How you doing?
- Good. Get in the back, Bart. In the back!

190
00:19:31,286 --> 00:19:34,983
- How you doing? Good to see you.
- It's going well.

191
00:19:35,157 --> 00:19:37,990
Good. Rock 'n' roll!

192
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:45,399
- How you doing?
- Doing good.

193
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:48,234
- You working?
- I'm riveting.

194
00:19:48,403 --> 00:19:51,531
Kitchens and bathrooms
in portable homes.

195
00:19:53,408 --> 00:19:54,773
How'd you get the job?

196
00:19:55,143 --> 00:19:57,805
Well, when I came out,
the parole officer got it for me...

197
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:02,076
...and when I got off parole, Selma said,
"It's good enough. Why don't you keep it?"

198
00:20:02,251 --> 00:20:04,811
You'll be a riveter
the rest of your life, man.

199
00:20:04,987 --> 00:20:07,182
Shit, no, man.
I'm working on my time.

200
00:20:07,356 --> 00:20:09,756
I'm getting my drums together.
I'm gonna play.

201
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:11,858
Holy Jesus!

202
00:20:12,027 --> 00:20:15,326
- Are you the one I talked to on the phone?
- Shake hands with Max Dembo.

203
00:20:15,497 --> 00:20:17,260
- This is my son, Henry.
- How you doing?

204
00:20:17,432 --> 00:20:19,559
Tell him a knock-knock joke.
He's got tons.

205
00:20:19,735 --> 00:20:22,101
- Knock-knock.
- Who's there?

206
00:20:22,738 --> 00:20:25,070
- You.
- You who?

207
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,535
Gotcha. I know that one.

208
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,619
Hey, look what I found downtown, Mama.

209
00:20:45,794 --> 00:20:47,159
Henry.

210
00:20:47,462 --> 00:20:50,488
- Come on, Bart!
- Get inside there.

211
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,930
- Hello, Max.
- Hi, Selma.

212
00:20:53,101 --> 00:20:55,729
- You didn't bring any beer, did you?
- Was I supposed to?

213
00:20:55,904 --> 00:20:57,599
- I got it.
- Good.

214
00:20:57,773 --> 00:20:59,206
How about some spaghetti?

215
00:20:59,374 --> 00:21:02,832
- Get inside. Get in, come on.
- Oh, God. Jesus, come on inside.

216
00:21:03,078 --> 00:21:07,139
- Come on, come on. Get in.
- God dog, that smells good.

217
00:21:08,216 --> 00:21:11,583
Show Max your muscle.
Make it. Make it big.

218
00:21:11,753 --> 00:21:13,550
Pretty hard. Let me see the other one.

219
00:21:13,722 --> 00:21:15,849
Make two of them.
Two of them at once, here.

220
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,753
You work out?

221
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:21,024
Does he work out? Come here.

222
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:24,461
- Show Max what we do on Saturdays.
- You teaching him to defend himself?

223
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:26,658
You bet your ass. On our days off.

224
00:21:26,835 --> 00:21:28,598
- How could you teach him?
- Got one in.

225
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,704
Got one in there. Come on.

226
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,944
- Okay, okay.
- He's gonna whip your ass.

227
00:21:37,112 --> 00:21:38,545
Where's them cigars?

228
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,909
Hey. I told...

229
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,144
So he's...

230
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,187
Don't be hitting me
when I'm not looking at you.

231
00:21:48,357 --> 00:21:50,689
Oh, he's just playing.

232
00:21:55,097 --> 00:21:56,928
You defend yourself pretty good there.

233
00:21:57,099 --> 00:22:00,535
- You been in many fights?
- Yeah, 10.

234
00:22:00,702 --> 00:22:04,798
- Ten? Not bad. How many have you won?
- Eighteen.

235
00:22:04,973 --> 00:22:08,272
Really? That's not a bad record.

236
00:22:11,613 --> 00:22:13,808
Eighteen out of 10.

237
00:22:15,183 --> 00:22:17,913
Hey, how you feel?
You wanna go out and hit the tubs?

238
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,144
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

239
00:22:19,321 --> 00:22:22,347
I think he'd better go in
and clean up his room now.

240
00:22:22,824 --> 00:22:26,316
Selma, let me have about 10 minutes
with him, because I wanna make it...

241
00:22:26,495 --> 00:22:28,360
- I didn't mean to get mad.
- I know.

242
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:31,556
- He's gotta get to bed early, okay?
- Just let... We...

243
00:22:31,867 --> 00:22:34,028
Let him go in
and clean up his room, okay?

244
00:22:34,202 --> 00:22:36,432
He's gotta get up early
tomorrow morning.

245
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,242
- Okay?
- Okay.

246
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,410
Come here. I get a kiss.

247
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:51,712
- I get one too. Good night.
- Give Max a kiss. That's it.

248
00:22:52,854 --> 00:22:54,947
Everybody gets a kiss.

249
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:57,284
- Hey, I'm sorry.
- Okay.

250
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,687
I didn't mean to get mad.

251
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,088
Okay?

252
00:23:01,563 --> 00:23:03,861
Didn't mean to get mad at you.

253
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,858
See you later. Excuse me.

254
00:23:09,438 --> 00:23:12,100
I'll be getting that board together.

255
00:23:18,613 --> 00:23:20,274
You got any more coffee?

256
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:33,059
That Henry is a nice boy.

257
00:23:33,228 --> 00:23:34,923
Yes, he is.

258
00:23:38,533 --> 00:23:40,524
Come here, man. Get up here.

259
00:23:40,702 --> 00:23:41,930
Come on. Get up here.

260
00:23:42,104 --> 00:23:44,595
Come on. Get up here.

261
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,138
Sit up here. Smart dog.

262
00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:48,799
Come here.

263
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:52,279
Want something to eat?
Okay if I give him some ice cream?

264
00:23:52,447 --> 00:23:54,210
Sure. He'll eat anything,

265
00:23:54,382 --> 00:23:57,476
Next time I'm down here,
I'm gonna bring him a steak bone.

266
00:23:57,652 --> 00:24:01,088
In fact, as soon as Willy turns his back,
I'm gonna steal this dog.

267
00:24:01,256 --> 00:24:03,850
You know, Max,
I don't wanna hurt your feelings...

268
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:06,721
...but your being around here
is kind of bad timing for us.

269
00:24:06,895 --> 00:24:08,453
Why is that?

270
00:24:09,231 --> 00:24:12,997
Well, Willy's been doing real good,
you know.

271
00:24:13,168 --> 00:24:17,332
He's been doing real fine.
He's been working hard lately.

272
00:24:17,973 --> 00:24:21,807
And I know you're good friends
and he really loves you...

273
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:26,611
...but I just don't think it's good
that he see you right now.

274
00:24:27,516 --> 00:24:28,813
You know what I mean?

275
00:24:28,984 --> 00:24:31,782
You trying to tell me
you don't want me to come here no more?

276
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:37,189
I don't mean to be unkind...

277
00:24:39,261 --> 00:24:43,391
...but I just think it's better that he doesn't
get around other influences and stuff.

278
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,044
You're on parole now, Max.

279
00:25:05,353 --> 00:25:08,720
Well, you really shouldn't even
be seen with Willy, right?

280
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:12,419
I think I get the message.

281
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,890
You make me feel bad.

282
00:25:17,232 --> 00:25:21,066
Why? You're just doing
what you have to do, Selma.

283
00:25:21,536 --> 00:25:23,163
It's no problem.

284
00:25:24,573 --> 00:25:26,063
It's cool.

285
00:25:41,556 --> 00:25:43,114
This is it.

286
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,261
- Here. Let me get it.
- I'll get the front.

287
00:25:50,432 --> 00:25:52,161
- You sure?
- Yeah.

288
00:25:52,334 --> 00:25:55,735
- All right. It's three flights up.
- I gotta piss, so you'd better run.

289
00:25:55,904 --> 00:25:57,337
All right.

290
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:10,106
Remember that place called The Hague?
Right across from the Cocoanut Grove.

291
00:26:10,285 --> 00:26:12,845
- Where do you want it?
- Put it underneath the bed there.

292
00:26:13,021 --> 00:26:16,582
Every time I was there, Hampton Hawes
and Chet Baker were playing there.

293
00:26:16,758 --> 00:26:18,658
- Is it still open?
- I don't know.

294
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:23,287
- Three flights of stairs killed me.
- Go back in the joint, you'll get in shape.

295
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:25,558
- Hold it up.
- I got it.

296
00:26:26,301 --> 00:26:29,930
- You sure it don't have termites?
- It's okay.

297
00:26:30,105 --> 00:26:33,836
How does it feel?
That's the main thing.

298
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,340
It's good, isn't it?

299
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,410
I know where we could go.

300
00:26:37,579 --> 00:26:40,548
- The Autoway Club.
- The what?

301
00:26:40,715 --> 00:26:43,377
The Autoway Club. Remember that?
We used to go there?

302
00:26:43,551 --> 00:26:45,781
- We could go.
- Do a little fucking around, maybe.

303
00:26:45,954 --> 00:26:48,422
Yeah. Maybe we could
go to Hermosa Beach too.

304
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,217
Oh, yeah.

305
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:53,158
- Howard Rumsey...
- Yeah.

306
00:26:53,328 --> 00:26:55,353
...and his Lighthouse All-Stars.

307
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,489
All right, let's go there. Maybe there'll be
some nice little girls there I can...

308
00:27:05,607 --> 00:27:07,734
You can get me three years for that.

309
00:27:10,945 --> 00:27:12,378
Sorry.

310
00:27:21,856 --> 00:27:23,721
I got excited, that's all.

311
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,190
Does Selma know you're using?

312
00:27:26,361 --> 00:27:28,795
Well, she's always suspicious.

313
00:28:35,163 --> 00:28:37,757
The machine broke down,
so I gotta stay.

314
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:42,967
What do you want me to tell you?
I'll probably be about two or three hours.

315
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,833
Well, I'm glad.

316
00:28:45,006 --> 00:28:46,871
All right. Bye.

317
00:29:09,297 --> 00:29:12,994
- Hello. Jenny Mercer speaking.
- Hi. How you doing? This is Max Dembo.

318
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,762
Thank you for making me
a bona fide member of society.

319
00:29:15,937 --> 00:29:18,337
Oh, you got the job? That's great.

320
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,838
- Why don't you have dinner with me?
- When?

321
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:24,672
I could be there in an hour and a half.
I wanna go home and shower and change.

322
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,076
Actually, I was planning on
staying home tonight.

323
00:29:27,248 --> 00:29:30,479
It's just that it's the first chance I have
to celebrate something.

324
00:29:30,652 --> 00:29:32,381
You know? I want to...

325
00:29:32,554 --> 00:29:35,751
You know, I wanna have a steak.
I thought you could keep me company.

326
00:29:35,924 --> 00:29:39,951
- I don't even know what to order.
- Okay.

327
00:29:40,128 --> 00:29:41,527
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

328
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:46,565
All right, can I be at your office,
let's say about 5:30?

329
00:29:46,734 --> 00:29:47,962
- See you then.
- All right.

330
00:29:48,136 --> 00:29:50,070
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

331
00:29:54,075 --> 00:29:58,239
All I'm saying is, out here, the rules
aren't defined. On the inside, they are.

332
00:29:58,413 --> 00:30:02,042
If you don't pay back your debts, if you
owe a couple packs of cigarettes...

333
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:06,210
...if you take somebody's glove or
if you lie to someone, then you get killed.

334
00:30:06,788 --> 00:30:09,484
You know that's the rules,
so you live by them.

335
00:30:09,858 --> 00:30:13,692
You can get killed with a sharp edge...

336
00:30:13,862 --> 00:30:15,659
...the end of this spoon.

337
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,354
That's a lethal weapon.

338
00:30:17,532 --> 00:30:19,295
Even the end of a toothbrush.

339
00:30:19,467 --> 00:30:23,961
You can get hit in the yard
or you can get it in the shower.

340
00:30:24,372 --> 00:30:29,571
If you're in your cell sleeping, someone
can go by with a can of gas and throw it in.

341
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:32,076
Somebody else throws in a match
and you're torched.

342
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:35,546
You know that's the reality
and you're living with it 24 hours a day.

343
00:30:36,451 --> 00:30:37,679
That's frightening.

344
00:30:37,852 --> 00:30:40,912
A lot of guys think this is more frightening,
being on the outside.

345
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,614
Why? I don't understand.

346
00:30:44,492 --> 00:30:48,428
Because out here, it's what you
got in your pocket that matters...

347
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:51,622
...and on the inside,
it's only what you are.

348
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:53,925
You're glad to be out, aren't you?

349
00:30:58,506 --> 00:31:04,809
It's like a dream.
It's every con's fantasy to be out here.

350
00:31:05,547 --> 00:31:11,782
I can't tell you the number of times
I thought about a scene just like this...

351
00:31:14,422 --> 00:31:18,722
...but I never thought I'd be sitting here
with a knot in my stomach.

352
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:24,858
Tell me more about that guy
you were going with.

353
00:31:25,033 --> 00:31:26,728
How long were you with him?

354
00:31:27,368 --> 00:31:30,337
I lived with him for about two years.

355
00:31:30,505 --> 00:31:32,530
Who broke it off?

356
00:31:32,707 --> 00:31:34,572
I did.

357
00:31:35,276 --> 00:31:37,972
Thank you very much.
Come on back again.

358
00:31:40,214 --> 00:31:44,014
Wanna know something?
I'm glad you asked me out.

359
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:52,324
Don't you have enough money?

360
00:31:53,127 --> 00:31:55,687
I think I got enough for the tax.

361
00:31:56,364 --> 00:31:57,592
Here, I've got some.

362
00:31:57,765 --> 00:32:00,893
Wait a minute.
I wanted this to be my treat.

363
00:32:02,637 --> 00:32:04,935
Why don't we just walk out?

364
00:32:05,373 --> 00:32:07,933
You don't wanna do that, do you?

365
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:12,211
I'll make you a deal. If you'll go out with me
tomorrow night, I'll let you help me.

366
00:32:13,881 --> 00:32:16,145
Okay, you've got a deal.

367
00:32:17,118 --> 00:32:20,645
All right, be discreet
and slip it under the table.

368
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:39,394
Hi, how you doing?

369
00:33:40,668 --> 00:33:41,896
Okay.

370
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:45,005
I was in the neighborhood,
so I had your manager let me in.

371
00:33:45,173 --> 00:33:48,438
- Mind if I come in?
- Sure. Come on, it's your home.

372
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,839
I mean, this is just routine, you know.

373
00:33:51,012 --> 00:33:54,038
It's a nice room.
You've got cross-ventilation. Nice view.

374
00:33:54,215 --> 00:33:57,241
- Yeah, it's nice.
- What they charge you for?

375
00:33:57,418 --> 00:33:59,943
It's $ 17 a week.

376
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,988
- That's better than $ 17 in a motel.
- Yeah.

377
00:34:03,157 --> 00:34:04,556
- You're right.
- I know.

378
00:34:04,726 --> 00:34:07,752
Do you mind if I change?
I gotta be somewhere in a half-hour.

379
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:10,955
No, go right ahead.
Don't let me hold you up. Go ahead.

380
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,727
- What do you got, a date?
- Yeah.

381
00:34:13,901 --> 00:34:15,528
Is she white?

382
00:34:15,703 --> 00:34:17,933
I'm just joking.

383
00:34:19,907 --> 00:34:21,431
So...

384
00:34:21,609 --> 00:34:22,837
...who is she?

385
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:25,638
I met her at the employment agency.
She works there.

386
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:29,840
In fact, she sent me for a job
and I went over there and I got it.

387
00:34:30,017 --> 00:34:32,952
Great. Great. What kind of work is it?

388
00:34:33,121 --> 00:34:34,952
Well, it's just a can company,
you know.

389
00:34:35,123 --> 00:34:36,750
- Regular wage?
- Yeah.

390
00:34:36,924 --> 00:34:40,291
Well, that's a start.
Did you tell them you were on parole?

391
00:34:40,461 --> 00:34:41,860
No. Is that a problem?

392
00:34:42,029 --> 00:34:44,088
Oh, no worry.
I can take care of that.

393
00:34:44,265 --> 00:34:46,460
You've got a room,
you've got a job, the whole...

394
00:34:46,634 --> 00:34:49,899
You gave me a week, so yeah.
It's over in Verona.

395
00:34:52,206 --> 00:34:53,867
What's this?

396
00:34:55,209 --> 00:34:57,370
- Just matches.
- I know that.

397
00:34:57,545 --> 00:34:59,206
Take off your shirt.
Let's see your arms.

398
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,746
- They're not mine.
- Max, take off your shirt.

399
00:35:11,259 --> 00:35:12,658
What's this?

400
00:35:12,827 --> 00:35:16,661
That's just a scratch I got
on the job today. It's not tracks.

401
00:35:17,131 --> 00:35:19,224
- Let me see this one.
- You won't find nothing.

402
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,334
Just let me do my work.

403
00:35:23,738 --> 00:35:27,401
- Where'd you get all those scars?
- It's just burns.

404
00:35:27,575 --> 00:35:30,009
- When you were a kid?
- Yeah, it was an accident.

405
00:35:30,178 --> 00:35:31,702
Does it hurt?

406
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,904
Let me see the other one.

407
00:35:34,348 --> 00:35:38,182
Did you hear about the Polack
who got third-degree burns on his face?

408
00:35:38,953 --> 00:35:41,183
He was dunking for french fries.

409
00:35:41,355 --> 00:35:43,118
Been drinking some beer, huh?

410
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:45,054
Yeah. Just a couple cans, though.

411
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,524
- What are you doing?
- Come on, Max.

412
00:35:47,695 --> 00:35:49,925
Come on, Max. Come on, now.
Take it easy.

413
00:35:50,097 --> 00:35:52,327
Why'd you do that?
You didn't have to chain me.

414
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,559
- It's procedure.
- I told you, I'm clean.

415
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,032
Then you got nothing
to worry about.

416
00:35:56,204 --> 00:35:58,672
Just come over here and check me
if you got a doubt.

417
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,067
- Lf you're clean...
- What do you mean, "if"?

418
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,642
You didn't check me properly.
Did you check my eyes?

419
00:36:03,811 --> 00:36:05,904
If you're clean,
you got nothing to worry about.

420
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,049
I gotta make a phone call,
then we'll take you down and test you.

421
00:36:09,217 --> 00:36:13,313
- I could save you a lot of trouble.
- It's no trouble. It's what I get paid for.

422
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:23,721
We're just playing a game.

423
00:36:35,643 --> 00:36:37,702
All right. Come on, follow me.

424
00:36:40,715 --> 00:36:42,580
Come on. Keep it up.

425
00:36:51,525 --> 00:36:53,254
All right, move right in here.

426
00:36:53,427 --> 00:36:58,126
- Gentlemen, follow the red line.
- Take your hat off.

427
00:37:01,402 --> 00:37:03,996
Right in the corner, facing me.
Take your hat off.

428
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:10,169
Starting with you, right over in this corner.
Facing me, gentlemen.

429
00:37:10,344 --> 00:37:12,608
Everybody facing me.

430
00:37:13,447 --> 00:37:16,939
In case you don't know where you are,
this is the Los Angeles County Jail.

431
00:37:17,118 --> 00:37:21,521
Welcome, and empty your pockets
on the floor. Everything out.

432
00:37:21,689 --> 00:37:25,682
Cigarettes, money, matches, everything.
On the floor.

433
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:29,986
Turn your pockets inside out
after you get everything out.

434
00:37:35,236 --> 00:37:38,831
Okay, gentlemen, I want you to run
your fingers through your hair.

435
00:37:39,707 --> 00:37:41,868
Shake it out good.

436
00:37:42,043 --> 00:37:43,670
Shake it out good.

437
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,475
- Is that a wig?
- Yeah, it's a wig.

438
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:49,980
Take it off. Put it on the floor.

439
00:37:50,918 --> 00:37:53,045
Run your hands through your hair.

440
00:37:57,925 --> 00:38:01,861
Okay, gentlemen, put your hands
out in front of you, palms up.

441
00:38:04,165 --> 00:38:06,360
Okay, turn over.

442
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:11,099
Okay, gentlemen, turn around
and grab a piece of the wall.

443
00:38:11,272 --> 00:38:12,899
Step back. Spread your feet.

444
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:27,342
As soon as you take your clothes off,
I want you to sit on a bench.

445
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,283
Okay, move on.

446
00:38:29,457 --> 00:38:31,755
Don't be afraid to use some soap.

447
00:38:32,827 --> 00:38:35,853
All right, gentlemen,
you people in the shower, let's move it out.

448
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:39,625
We don't have all day.
That water's not free.

449
00:38:42,203 --> 00:38:44,137
Take your showers and get out.

450
00:38:44,305 --> 00:38:48,969
As soon as you step out of your shower,
grab a towel and step over on the side.

451
00:38:49,143 --> 00:38:51,805
Dry yourself off thoroughly.

452
00:38:53,114 --> 00:38:55,048
Let's go, gentlemen.

453
00:38:56,817 --> 00:38:58,444
Turn around.

454
00:39:00,121 --> 00:39:03,318
- Go. Let's go, arms up.
- Lf you were on a bench, get in the shower.

455
00:39:03,491 --> 00:39:05,982
- Small, medium or large?
- Medium.

456
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,597
- Head down. Turn around. Go.
- Let's go, gentlemen.

457
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:14,394
Get out of the shower and dry off.
We don't have enough time.

458
00:39:14,568 --> 00:39:17,128
- Let's go. Move it out.
- Good hands, Pop.

459
00:39:30,151 --> 00:39:32,381
That one's mine, partner.

460
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:55,771
Stand clear!

461
00:40:48,929 --> 00:40:51,659
Dembo! Visit!

462
00:41:24,865 --> 00:41:26,958
- Hi, remember me?
- Yeah. How you doing?

463
00:41:27,134 --> 00:41:30,467
- Pretty good. How are you?
- I'm fine.

464
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:35,308
I called your hotel and your landlady told me
you were arrested. What happened?

465
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:38,402
I don't know.

466
00:41:39,346 --> 00:41:40,938
Doesn't matter.

467
00:41:42,216 --> 00:41:44,844
I got worried. I was waiting and...

468
00:41:45,953 --> 00:41:47,580
When are you getting out?

469
00:41:52,493 --> 00:41:54,961
I don't know.
It's a little hard to say.

470
00:41:57,965 --> 00:42:00,627
You don't mind my coming here, do you?

471
00:42:04,305 --> 00:42:08,469
I called earlier and they said
the visiting room closes at 3.

472
00:42:08,642 --> 00:42:11,042
I got lost on the way.

473
00:42:14,748 --> 00:42:16,978
Is there anything I can do?

474
00:42:20,187 --> 00:42:23,213
- No, it's all right.
- What?

475
00:42:25,059 --> 00:42:28,927
Oh, God, there's no more time.
Wait a second.

476
00:42:34,935 --> 00:42:36,425
- I gotta go.
- Wait. Wait.

477
00:42:38,372 --> 00:42:40,237
Call me when you get out.

478
00:42:40,407 --> 00:42:43,308
Call me. It's my home phone.

479
00:42:44,912 --> 00:42:46,641
Okay?

480
00:43:34,128 --> 00:43:38,292
This terrific-looking blond goes into this
dentist's office and she's really scared.

481
00:43:38,465 --> 00:43:42,333
So she climbs up into the chair as the
dentist is preparing his utensils and things.

482
00:43:42,503 --> 00:43:45,666
And just as he turns around
and is about to look into her mouth...

483
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,933
...she blurts out,
"Oh, doctor, I'm so afraid of dentists...

484
00:43:49,109 --> 00:43:52,237
...why, I think I'd rather have a baby
than have a tooth drilled."

485
00:43:52,413 --> 00:43:55,610
"Well, miss," the doctor says,
"you'd better make up your mind...

486
00:43:55,783 --> 00:43:58,308
...before I adjust the chair."

487
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:06,022
So how you doing?

488
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:10,526
How do you think I'm doing,
slammed down?

489
00:44:11,865 --> 00:44:13,423
What?

490
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,797
I'm okay.

491
00:44:15,969 --> 00:44:19,837
Listen, your urine tested clean.

492
00:44:20,774 --> 00:44:23,868
I'm sorry you got stuck here,
but I've had my hands full this week.

493
00:44:24,044 --> 00:44:27,536
- This is the first time I could reach you.
- Did the phones break down?

494
00:44:28,882 --> 00:44:31,783
Don't get sarcastic with me, Dembo.

495
00:44:32,353 --> 00:44:35,845
I'm having you released from here.
I'll take you to a halfway house myself.

496
00:44:36,023 --> 00:44:38,821
- When is that? Now?
- Right now.

497
00:44:38,992 --> 00:44:41,460
I think that's more than generous.

498
00:44:44,331 --> 00:44:45,559
You're the boss.

499
00:44:45,733 --> 00:44:48,702
Right. You're smart enough
to recognize a break when you get one.

500
00:44:48,869 --> 00:44:51,360
Now, you were clean,
but somebody fixed in your room.

501
00:44:51,538 --> 00:44:54,473
That's a violation of your parole
and it's enough to get you...

502
00:44:54,641 --> 00:44:56,666
...a minimum of two to three years.

503
00:44:56,844 --> 00:44:58,471
Am I right?

504
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,514
- So we'll start from scratch.
- Sure.

505
00:45:02,683 --> 00:45:05,584
We'll get you cleaned up
and we'll get you out of here.

506
00:45:06,387 --> 00:45:09,015
- Okay.
- All right.

507
00:45:10,224 --> 00:45:13,318
Sometimes this job
is getting to be too much.

508
00:45:13,494 --> 00:45:15,621
You wouldn't believe the week
I had last week.

509
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:19,027
I missed my girl's school play.
My wife was so pissed off at me...

510
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:20,962
...I thought she was gonna divorce me.

511
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:24,662
On top of that, I got a call that one
of my guys was holed up in his house.

512
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:28,035
Threatening his wife with a shotgun.
Guess how I handled that one.

513
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:29,573
I used my head.

514
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:32,101
I called his father in Detroit...

515
00:45:32,279 --> 00:45:35,908
...then I got them talking on the phone.
They must have talked for three hours.

516
00:45:36,083 --> 00:45:39,416
All this is person-to-person.
It's costing the state.

517
00:45:41,722 --> 00:45:46,386
- In the top of the seventh inning, Dodgers
leading 10-2. Scored 10 each game.

518
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,326
Damn it. You know, I had 10 bucks
on that game.

519
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:52,988
Everything you got check out?

520
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:56,029
- Yeah.
- Good.

521
00:45:56,203 --> 00:45:58,535
Cooking spoon's not there, is it?

522
00:45:59,706 --> 00:46:03,540
Come on. Just between you and me,
this doesn't go any further...

523
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:05,575
...who was it shot up in your room?

524
00:46:07,948 --> 00:46:10,212
I just can't tell you that.

525
00:46:10,617 --> 00:46:14,348
I'm taking you to a halfway house.
I'm not taking you back to the joint.

526
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,682
You asked for my trust.
I'm giving it to you.

527
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:20,190
- How about giving me a little back in return?
- I can't tell you that.

528
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,421
That's bullshit. If you can't trust me,
what the hell, I'm just wasting gas driving.

529
00:46:24,598 --> 00:46:28,193
- I don't want you to waste your gas.
- Then tell me who it was.

530
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,176
Christ, you're gonna kill us!

531
00:46:48,689 --> 00:46:51,089
Cut it out. Go on.

532
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,430
Don't fuck with me, sucker.
You busted me for nothing!

533
00:47:02,603 --> 00:47:05,071
You big, bald fucker!

534
00:47:20,787 --> 00:47:24,154
You're finished.
You made your choice.

535
00:47:35,969 --> 00:47:37,630
Max!

536
00:47:48,882 --> 00:47:54,252
- Damn you sons of bitches!
- Hey, fatso, where's your pants?

537
00:48:22,449 --> 00:48:25,384
- Hey, how you doing, man?
- Hey, my friend.

538
00:48:25,552 --> 00:48:27,850
- How you been?
- Haven't seen you in a while.

539
00:48:28,021 --> 00:48:29,613
I know, I got hung up for a while.

540
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:32,190
- What you got going?
- I need your car.

541
00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:33,792
- The keys are in it.
- All right.

542
00:48:33,961 --> 00:48:37,158
- Hey, take me with you.
- I can't. I gotta see some people.

543
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,798
Be back in a couple hours.

544
00:48:38,966 --> 00:48:41,696
- Next time, I wanna go with you.
- All right, you got it.

545
00:48:41,868 --> 00:48:43,768
- I'm not shitting you.
- I hear you.

546
00:48:44,471 --> 00:48:47,531
- Lf I go with you, I can drive. I can get...
- You got it.

547
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:49,938
Hey, my radio.

548
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:51,702
I'll be back, couple hours.

549
00:48:51,878 --> 00:48:53,106
Where's he going?

550
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,408
He's going to the store.
He'll be back in a minute.

551
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:47,025
- How are you? What's to it, Manny?
- How you doing, man?

552
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,532
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

553
00:49:49,703 --> 00:49:51,568
I wanna talk.

554
00:49:52,205 --> 00:49:54,730
- Yeah.
- I mean right now, okay?

555
00:49:57,044 --> 00:50:00,411
- Lf anybody asks for me, I'm not here.
- All right.

556
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,780
- What do you wanna talk about?
- I just need your help.

557
00:50:10,157 --> 00:50:13,024
- What do you want, money?
- I want a pistol.

558
00:50:14,294 --> 00:50:16,057
No, I don't do that, Max.

559
00:50:16,229 --> 00:50:19,995
- You don't keep a piece in your office?
- I don't play around with guns.

560
00:50:21,501 --> 00:50:24,664
You owe me one, Manny.
You owe me one.

561
00:50:29,242 --> 00:50:31,107
Come on.

562
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,575
Shut the door.

563
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:39,947
- I got something we took off a drunk.
- Just give me what you have.

564
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,055
I just gotta get my hands
on some heavy stuff, you know?

565
00:50:43,223 --> 00:50:46,784
I need a Thompson, you know, a Magnum.

566
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:49,754
Maybe a shotgun.
Can you raise that for me?

567
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:51,864
- Takes a lot of cash, Max.
- What is this?

568
00:50:52,032 --> 00:50:54,364
It's a piece of shit.
We took it off a drunk.

569
00:50:54,534 --> 00:50:57,196
- Does it work?
- I don't know. I don't play with those.

570
00:50:57,370 --> 00:51:00,533
- Makes my dick hard.
- It's yours.

571
00:51:01,575 --> 00:51:03,702
You put up the money,
I'll take care of you.

572
00:51:03,877 --> 00:51:07,335
- I ain't got that kind of cash.
- You're doing a lot of business out there.

573
00:51:07,514 --> 00:51:09,072
How much time do you need?

574
00:51:09,249 --> 00:51:12,707
- Give me a couple of days.
- You got it.

575
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:17,789
I read you, Manny. Try for it tonight.
I'll call your house in the morning.

576
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:23,623
Give me one full day. Go that way.
Go the side way.

577
00:51:23,797 --> 00:51:25,697
One full day.

578
00:52:41,041 --> 00:52:42,872
Take it easy and you won't get hurt.

579
00:52:43,043 --> 00:52:44,772
Give me the money.

580
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:47,042
Open the register.

581
00:52:50,383 --> 00:52:52,078
Open the register.

582
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:53,480
Does he speak English?

583
00:52:53,653 --> 00:52:55,450
Better tell him to open the register.

584
00:53:01,561 --> 00:53:04,530
Open the fucking register
or I'll blow your fucking head off.

585
00:53:04,698 --> 00:53:07,360
- Open it. You feel that? You feel that?
- Yeah.

586
00:53:07,534 --> 00:53:08,865
Open it.

587
00:53:10,871 --> 00:53:13,135
Get down. Get down.

588
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:17,242
Hold it.

589
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,178
Hold it.

590
00:53:28,989 --> 00:53:30,513
Don't move.

591
00:53:35,662 --> 00:53:37,493
Don't come out.

592
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:55,539
What are you thinking about?

593
00:54:57,377 --> 00:55:00,107
You know you're
breaking the law right now?

594
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,077
What do you mean?

595
00:55:02,515 --> 00:55:06,315
I mean, a cop could knock on that door,
put you in jail.

596
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:11,987
Why would he do that?

597
00:55:12,492 --> 00:55:14,551
You're harboring a fugitive.

598
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:18,425
I jumped my parole yesterday.
I'm on the run.

599
00:55:20,266 --> 00:55:22,598
I'll take my chances.

600
00:55:25,705 --> 00:55:27,696
No, I don't want any.

601
00:55:32,612 --> 00:55:35,103
I'd like to take you out tonight...

602
00:55:35,281 --> 00:55:38,444
...but I got some business to do
with some people...

603
00:55:38,618 --> 00:55:41,746
...so why don't you just let me
borrow your car for a while?

604
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:45,652
Okay.

605
00:55:50,697 --> 00:55:52,289
Promise not to steal it?

606
00:55:58,138 --> 00:56:00,606
Gotta go to work in the morning.

607
00:56:30,703 --> 00:56:32,330
- Damn, you scared me.
- Hey, Max.

608
00:56:32,505 --> 00:56:33,733
Mickey. How you been?

609
00:56:33,907 --> 00:56:35,568
- All right. When did you raise?
- A couple days ago.

610
00:56:35,742 --> 00:56:39,269
- Where'd you get those threads?
- I bought them. Let's go sit down, friend.

611
00:56:39,446 --> 00:56:41,107
You're looking good.

612
00:56:41,281 --> 00:56:42,771
- Slick.
- Yeah.

613
00:56:42,949 --> 00:56:44,382
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

614
00:56:44,551 --> 00:56:46,280
Why don't you let us
have that seat...

615
00:56:46,453 --> 00:56:48,853
...so me and my friend
can talk some business?

616
00:56:49,389 --> 00:56:52,415
- So how have you been?
- How long have you been around?

617
00:56:52,592 --> 00:56:54,651
I don't know. A couple years.

618
00:56:54,861 --> 00:56:56,692
- Want a drink?
- Yeah.

619
00:56:56,863 --> 00:57:01,163
- Tommy.
- Double Jack Daniel's with a 7 back.

620
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:04,599
- What do you want?
- I'll have one of these things right here.

621
00:57:05,138 --> 00:57:06,833
How you been?

622
00:57:08,875 --> 00:57:11,070
Ready to make a move.

623
00:57:11,411 --> 00:57:13,208
You got something
you wanna run by me?

624
00:57:13,379 --> 00:57:16,405
I got a sweet poker game in the Valley
you might be interested in.

625
00:57:16,616 --> 00:57:19,608
- Sounds good. What's it good for?
- Fifteen or 20 big ones.

626
00:57:19,786 --> 00:57:21,686
That much? Any guns?

627
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:24,323
No, just some fat-ass old men, man.

628
00:57:24,491 --> 00:57:28,393
They all got pacemakers that'll short-circuit
when you charge through the door.

629
00:57:30,163 --> 00:57:32,131
All right, I'm interested.

630
00:57:32,298 --> 00:57:33,765
Can you help me with a partner?

631
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,600
What about Kelly Mason?
He comes here all the time.

632
00:57:36,769 --> 00:57:38,634
He'd jump at the chance
to work with you.

633
00:57:38,805 --> 00:57:40,363
Who's that kid that just got up?

634
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:43,771
That's Augie Morales' brother.

635
00:57:43,943 --> 00:57:45,672
- Is that Augie's kid brother?
- Yeah.

636
00:57:45,845 --> 00:57:49,042
- Get him over here.
- Hey, Chungie. Come here.

637
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:52,350
- How you doing?
- Nice to see you again.

638
00:57:52,519 --> 00:57:55,647
This is Max Dembo, man.
He's a good friend of Augie's.

639
00:57:55,822 --> 00:57:57,619
- Hi.
- You don't remember me, do you?

640
00:57:57,790 --> 00:58:01,021
- Yes. You're a friend of my brother's, right?
- How's he doing?

641
00:58:01,194 --> 00:58:04,391
He's not doing very well right now.
He's doing 20 years in Arizona...

642
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:07,397
...and has a lot of problems
in California too.

643
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:10,900
- Can you vouch for him?
- He's as good as Augie was at that age.

644
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,731
Can I get ahold of him through you?

645
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:15,466
I got his phone number,
or you can catch him in here.

646
00:58:15,642 --> 00:58:18,304
I got something for you, maybe.
We'll talk later, okay?

647
00:58:18,478 --> 00:58:20,946
- Just give me a call.
- Give my love to your brother.

648
00:58:21,114 --> 00:58:24,481
- I will. Thank you very much. See you later.
- All right, take care.

649
00:58:24,651 --> 00:58:27,017
- Does he take shit?
- No, he's too smart for that.

650
00:58:27,187 --> 00:58:28,552
He's a good thief for his age.

651
00:58:29,489 --> 00:58:30,717
Know what I'd like to do?

652
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:34,053
Run me by that motel.
We'll check it out, then we can go cut it up.

653
00:58:35,295 --> 00:58:38,287
I'll drive you out there,
but I'm not gonna rob it for you.

654
00:58:38,464 --> 00:58:42,127
You've got to do that yourself,
you know. I got stomach trouble.

655
00:58:42,302 --> 00:58:44,167
No guts.

656
00:59:15,935 --> 00:59:17,664
Did I scare you?

657
00:59:18,871 --> 00:59:20,338
Yeah, a little bit.

658
00:59:41,761 --> 00:59:44,025
You gotta go to work pretty soon.

659
00:59:51,037 --> 00:59:53,028
What time is it?

660
01:01:40,747 --> 01:01:42,977
Wanna take a shower with me?

661
01:01:46,586 --> 01:01:48,247
Can I use your phone?

662
01:01:48,421 --> 01:01:50,252
Yeah, go ahead.

663
01:02:01,834 --> 01:02:04,098
Is Jerry Schue there?

664
01:02:04,404 --> 01:02:07,498
- Looks like you're fixed up pretty good.
- Yeah, it's going all right.

665
01:02:07,673 --> 01:02:10,198
After you fell,
I pulled a few jobs and met Carol.

666
01:02:10,376 --> 01:02:11,604
She straightened me out...

667
01:02:11,778 --> 01:02:15,544
...so I set myself up in the
painting/contracting business. Sit here.

668
01:02:16,015 --> 01:02:17,915
We bought the house.

669
01:02:18,084 --> 01:02:23,078
I got that boat. Put that pool in last year.
The only thing I need's a new car.

670
01:02:24,123 --> 01:02:27,251
That one out front belonged to Carol's ex.
It's about had it.

671
01:02:27,427 --> 01:02:30,555
When you were at Quentin,
did you know a guy named Don Shaffer?

672
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:32,857
- I don't think so.
- Kind of a short, squat guy.

673
01:02:33,032 --> 01:02:35,592
- He was my first husband.
- He don't know the man, honey.

674
01:02:35,768 --> 01:02:39,135
- So you got a place in town, Max, or what?
- Nickname "Lumpy."

675
01:02:39,305 --> 01:02:41,273
I know him.
Was that your first husband?

676
01:02:41,441 --> 01:02:42,738
Yeah, I know Lumpy.

677
01:02:42,909 --> 01:02:45,742
What are we gonna do, honey,
go down the whole damn list?

678
01:02:45,912 --> 01:02:48,642
First there was Lumpy,
then it was Steve the bodybuilder...

679
01:02:48,815 --> 01:02:50,510
...greased himself to death...

680
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:53,709
...then Raymond,
who sold us the lemon out front.

681
01:02:54,053 --> 01:02:57,386
- Did I leave any out?
- Oh, will you cut it out?

682
01:02:57,557 --> 01:03:00,458
So how'd you two lovebirds meet?

683
01:03:01,394 --> 01:03:03,760
I met her at a 31 Flavors, of all places.

684
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:06,194
Yeah, he was 32.

685
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:08,458
Isn't she a peach?

686
01:03:08,768 --> 01:03:12,067
Why don't we get Sherry
and we could all go out dancing later?

687
01:03:12,238 --> 01:03:15,036
Oh, you mean Sherry,
that blond that threw up in the car...

688
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:16,607
...the last time we went out?

689
01:03:16,776 --> 01:03:20,143
I know the kind of broad he wants.
A good-looking broad. Marlene.

690
01:03:20,313 --> 01:03:23,646
- I'd really like a beer, if you have one.
- Sure, I got beer.

691
01:03:23,816 --> 01:03:25,977
- Do you want everything on these burgers?
- Yeah.

692
01:03:26,152 --> 01:03:27,517
Okay. Here.

693
01:03:29,455 --> 01:03:31,184
Thanks.

694
01:03:31,624 --> 01:03:33,114
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

695
01:03:33,292 --> 01:03:34,953
Thank you, honey.

696
01:03:41,667 --> 01:03:43,464
Not bad.

697
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:46,438
Get me out of here.

698
01:03:47,807 --> 01:03:50,332
They're killing me.
I can't make this scene any more.

699
01:03:50,510 --> 01:03:52,137
Get me out of here.

700
01:03:53,946 --> 01:03:56,210
You got something.
I know you got something.

701
01:03:56,382 --> 01:03:58,145
Yeah, I got something.

702
01:03:58,317 --> 01:04:00,114
Well, let's do it.

703
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:05,019
- Don't you wanna know what it is?
- I don't give a damn. Let's just do it.

704
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:07,449
What is it?

705
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:11,459
A bunch of old guys play poker
over in a motel in the Valley.

706
01:04:11,631 --> 01:04:13,496
They got about $20,000 on the table.

707
01:04:13,666 --> 01:04:16,066
We just tiptoe in,
tiptoe out, and it's all ours.

708
01:04:16,235 --> 01:04:18,226
There ain't no cops
because they can't call.

709
01:04:18,404 --> 01:04:20,429
- Great. You got the guns?
- Yeah.

710
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:23,370
- We need a shotgun.
- Here, honey.

711
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:26,303
I don't know what to play.

712
01:04:26,479 --> 01:04:29,312
- You still playing that thing?
- I'm eating, for chrissake.

713
01:04:29,482 --> 01:04:31,279
You can play later, but I'd prefer now.

714
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:33,111
Play that song where you yodel.

715
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,811
What's that "Walking Stick" thing
you used to play?

716
01:04:36,088 --> 01:04:39,285
What "Walking Stick"? You mean
"Hand Me Down My Walking Cane"?

717
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:41,653
"Walking Cane," yeah, play that.

718
01:04:41,827 --> 01:04:44,227
Come on, we got cause to celebrate.

719
01:04:48,768 --> 01:04:50,429
Alrighty.

720
01:06:20,623 --> 01:06:23,251
Oh, shit, Max.

721
01:06:23,459 --> 01:06:27,657
All right, Jerry. Take it easy.
We're all right. He'll be here.

722
01:06:30,099 --> 01:06:32,192
Man, this is very unprofessional.

723
01:06:32,401 --> 01:06:35,393
All I'm saying is you give the man
10 minutes.

724
01:06:35,638 --> 01:06:37,230
He'll be here. It's all right.

725
01:06:37,406 --> 01:06:41,035
It's not all right, man. I've had it.
Get me out of here.

726
01:06:46,616 --> 01:06:48,106
Is that him?

727
01:06:49,585 --> 01:06:51,143
Is that him?

728
01:06:54,690 --> 01:06:57,523
No. If it was him,
he would have stopped.

729
01:07:02,498 --> 01:07:04,830
That's it. They're coming out.
It's over. Let's go.

730
01:07:05,001 --> 01:07:07,128
We're still all right.
We still can do it, man.

731
01:07:07,303 --> 01:07:10,238
It's over, man. Look at the people.
They're coming out, man.

732
01:07:10,406 --> 01:07:14,069
I mean, I don't care if he shows up
with a 20 mm cannon. It's over.

733
01:07:14,577 --> 01:07:16,135
Fuck it.

734
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:21,576
Jesus. Will you wait a minute, man?
They'll see you.

735
01:07:22,485 --> 01:07:25,454
We're all right. There's five
more guys in there. Let's do it.

736
01:07:25,621 --> 01:07:28,454
I told you, I'm not taking that game
without a shotgun.

737
01:07:28,624 --> 01:07:31,650
You can't cover a fucking poker game
without a shotgun, all right?

738
01:07:31,827 --> 01:07:34,625
The plan was to meet your friend here
with a shotgun...

739
01:07:34,797 --> 01:07:37,129
...we go in and do the job
and we leave, all right?

740
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:41,031
Now, we've been sitting here all night
waiting for the guy with the shotgun...

741
01:07:41,203 --> 01:07:43,262
...and you wanna take it
with your cap pistol...

742
01:07:43,439 --> 01:07:47,603
...and I'm telling you
it's very un-fucking-professional, all right?

743
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:57,578
- That's him.
- Lf that's him, tell him he's late.

744
01:08:08,030 --> 01:08:10,658
- How you doing?
- What's to it, Manny?

745
01:08:10,866 --> 01:08:14,632
Some really fucking weird shit.
You know the bartender, the asshole...

746
01:08:14,804 --> 01:08:16,669
What do you got for me?

747
01:08:16,906 --> 01:08:18,134
Go ahead.

748
01:08:18,307 --> 01:08:20,571
I was just gonna...
I didn't come with nothing...

749
01:08:20,743 --> 01:08:24,338
...because the bartender, I gave him
the key to my place to lock up...

750
01:08:24,513 --> 01:08:25,878
So, what'd you bring me?

751
01:08:26,048 --> 01:08:29,848
- I didn't bring you nothing. But l...
- Well, just tell me, why weren't you here?

752
01:08:30,019 --> 01:08:32,510
- Well, will you let me explain, Max?
- Yeah, go ahead.

753
01:08:37,093 --> 01:08:39,357
There's people up there.
They're gonna see you.

754
01:08:39,528 --> 01:08:41,325
- Are you out of your mind?
- Sorry.

755
01:08:41,497 --> 01:08:44,261
Come on, man. Calm down.
You made your point.

756
01:08:44,433 --> 01:08:47,459
You were righteous, okay?
Cool it, man. Just cool it.

757
01:08:47,637 --> 01:08:50,663
We fucked the score off on...
Hey, hey!

758
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:53,604
We fucked the score off
on account of you, you know that?

759
01:08:53,776 --> 01:08:57,542
Will you just settle down?
Get in the car. Please.

760
01:08:57,713 --> 01:09:00,546
You know, I counted on him.
He let me down. He was wrong.

761
01:09:00,716 --> 01:09:03,207
- So get in the car.
- He was wrong. He let me down.

762
01:09:03,819 --> 01:09:08,313
Hey, get in the car.
This ain't gonna make it, man. Okay?

763
01:09:08,491 --> 01:09:10,686
You're wrong, Manny. You know that?

764
01:09:10,860 --> 01:09:15,320
- You know that you're wrong, right?
- Come on, man. There's no money in this.

765
01:09:19,635 --> 01:09:21,500
How's it feel
getting fucked out of 20 grand?

766
01:09:21,671 --> 01:09:23,935
It ain't no big thing.
I just wanna get you home.

767
01:09:24,106 --> 01:09:25,334
Let's go. It's cold.

768
01:09:25,508 --> 01:09:27,738
- I've gotta cool this dude down.
- He won't tell.

769
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:31,107
I'm gonna make sure so I can keep you
on the streets. Turn the key.

770
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:33,578
- I'm all right.
- You going home?

771
01:09:33,749 --> 01:09:36,582
Tell me the truth. You going home?
You know what you're doing?

772
01:09:36,752 --> 01:09:40,210
- I won't let you down next time.
- Turn your lights on.

773
01:11:22,191 --> 01:11:23,954
Come on, baby.

774
01:11:38,574 --> 01:11:40,439
Shit.

775
01:11:40,743 --> 01:11:42,438
Fucker.

776
01:14:04,019 --> 01:14:05,486
Hi.

777
01:14:21,503 --> 01:14:23,164
What happened? Where've you been?

778
01:14:24,406 --> 01:14:26,101
I had to take care of some business.

779
01:14:26,275 --> 01:14:29,176
What kind of business?
Why are you all dirty?

780
01:14:30,679 --> 01:14:31,907
I broke through a wall.

781
01:14:32,915 --> 01:14:34,507
Why?

782
01:14:35,451 --> 01:14:37,214
I did something.

783
01:14:39,288 --> 01:14:41,415
The place looks nice.

784
01:14:42,124 --> 01:14:43,819
All right.

785
01:14:44,126 --> 01:14:48,324
What made you finally decide to unpack?

786
01:14:52,534 --> 01:14:54,832
How far you wanna take this?

787
01:15:00,743 --> 01:15:02,438
I don't know.

788
01:15:03,112 --> 01:15:06,081
I thought we were working
on something here, but maybe I'm wrong.

789
01:15:06,882 --> 01:15:08,850
No. What do you think
I've been doing?

790
01:15:09,018 --> 01:15:11,418
Guess I never really thought about it.

791
01:15:12,821 --> 01:15:16,279
Want me to lie and say I work
on a hot-dog stand? I can't do a regular job.

792
01:15:16,458 --> 01:15:17,823
I'm not gonna take your money.

793
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:20,885
Well, do you have
an alternative for me?

794
01:15:21,563 --> 01:15:22,894
I'm doing what I do.

795
01:15:23,065 --> 01:15:25,693
If you can't take it
and it's too heavy for you...

796
01:15:25,868 --> 01:15:28,063
...well, then I'll just walk out the door.

797
01:15:28,737 --> 01:15:31,297
I'll walk, but I don't want to.

798
01:15:31,673 --> 01:15:33,766
Was this just a one-time thing, or what?

799
01:15:34,443 --> 01:15:35,910
That depends on how lucky I get.

800
01:15:36,078 --> 01:15:38,876
The thing I had going got screwed up,
so I did another thing.

801
01:15:39,048 --> 01:15:41,744
I'm just trying to get myself together,
you know?

802
01:15:43,318 --> 01:15:46,412
If I could just get a decent score,
just put one thing together...

803
01:15:46,588 --> 01:15:50,684
...then we can kick back and maybe
we can get out of here. That's all.

804
01:15:52,294 --> 01:15:55,457
So I guess what we're really saying here
is if I can handle it.

805
01:15:56,165 --> 01:15:58,565
- That's right.
- I don't want you to go.

806
01:15:58,734 --> 01:16:00,167
And I don't want to either.

807
01:16:01,336 --> 01:16:05,466
It's just that this is so totally out of
my experience. You gotta understand.

808
01:16:05,641 --> 01:16:09,577
I'll promise you that I won't hurt you,
and whatever I do doesn't involve you.

809
01:16:09,745 --> 01:16:11,440
I keep it outside.

810
01:16:11,613 --> 01:16:14,173
But maybe it'd be better
if you didn't ask me questions.

811
01:16:15,317 --> 01:16:19,913
I'll stay with you as long as I can handle it,
but when I can't, I'm gonna go.

812
01:16:20,722 --> 01:16:22,349
I know that.

813
01:16:26,028 --> 01:16:28,019
Just be careful.

814
01:16:30,332 --> 01:16:32,800
I want you to know that
what you're doing out there...

815
01:16:32,968 --> 01:16:35,061
...it scares the shit out of me.

816
01:16:35,938 --> 01:16:37,803
It scares me too.

817
01:16:38,006 --> 01:16:39,496
Come here.

818
01:16:41,043 --> 01:16:43,238
You come here.

819
01:16:57,059 --> 01:17:00,654
- Can I give you something?
- What is it?

820
01:17:01,530 --> 01:17:05,125
Something I found.

821
01:17:11,673 --> 01:17:14,540
Come on, now. Don't be scared.

822
01:17:18,747 --> 01:17:20,009
Don't be scared.

823
01:17:20,182 --> 01:17:22,116
I can't help it.

824
01:18:40,262 --> 01:18:42,958
Excuse me, sir,
would you look right over there, please?

825
01:18:43,131 --> 01:18:45,099
All right, don't move.
Get up out of there.

826
01:18:45,267 --> 01:18:47,497
Get the fuck out of there, man.

827
01:18:50,405 --> 01:18:51,804
Get in there.

828
01:18:56,545 --> 01:19:00,777
All right, listen to me! This is a robbery!
Everybody on the floor.

829
01:19:00,949 --> 01:19:03,747
- Get down on the goddamn floor!
- Open the drawer.

830
01:19:04,052 --> 01:19:08,386
All the way down.
All you tellers, down on the floor.

831
01:19:08,724 --> 01:19:12,660
All the way down! Hey, get down!

832
01:19:12,828 --> 01:19:14,125
Open the drawer. Open it up.

833
01:19:14,296 --> 01:19:16,287
Get down before I start killing people!

834
01:19:16,465 --> 01:19:18,956
Get your drawer open, honey.
Get your drawer open.

835
01:19:19,134 --> 01:19:20,965
Stop looking at me!

836
01:19:24,039 --> 01:19:26,064
Get down on the goddamn floor!

837
01:19:27,776 --> 01:19:29,607
Thirty seconds.

838
01:19:40,789 --> 01:19:42,689
Twenty seconds.

839
01:19:50,666 --> 01:19:53,999
You in love with me?
Answer me! Are you in love with me?

840
01:19:54,469 --> 01:19:58,872
Then stop looking at me, motherfucker,
or I'll blow your goddamn face off!

841
01:20:00,475 --> 01:20:02,670
Time's up. Let's go.

842
01:20:08,483 --> 01:20:10,144
Let's go.

843
01:20:13,789 --> 01:20:15,848
Let's go!

844
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:19,288
Let's hit it.

845
01:20:19,695 --> 01:20:21,788
Let's go!

846
01:20:23,498 --> 01:20:25,796
Get back!

847
01:20:25,967 --> 01:20:29,630
Get back. Get down on the floor!

848
01:20:36,211 --> 01:20:38,145
Let's go.

849
01:20:50,292 --> 01:20:52,021
- How much did we get?
- We got a bunch.

850
01:20:52,194 --> 01:20:55,186
- How was I? Was I good?
- You scared the shit out of me.

851
01:21:41,777 --> 01:21:45,975
Hit it, hit it. Just hit it.
Hit it. Let's go.

852
01:21:49,551 --> 01:21:51,485
Make a left here.

853
01:22:00,162 --> 01:22:03,256
- What do we got?
- I don't know. I can't tell yet. It's fat.

854
01:22:03,432 --> 01:22:07,766
- What is it? Twenties, 30s, 50s?
- Yeah, there's 20s. There's no 30s, man.

855
01:22:07,936 --> 01:22:10,370
- Any ones?
- Yeah, there's a few ones.

856
01:22:10,539 --> 01:22:13,906
- A couple hundreds.
- What would you say, 20, 30,000? Forty?

857
01:22:14,075 --> 01:22:17,738
What's that look like?
What's that look like to you, huh?

858
01:22:17,913 --> 01:22:20,677
- What's this look like, huh?
- Let me feel it.

859
01:22:20,916 --> 01:22:23,885
Come on. Asshole.

860
01:22:24,052 --> 01:22:26,680
Put it up your fucking snoot, baby.

861
01:22:26,855 --> 01:22:28,720
- Man.
- We got more fucking money here...

862
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:30,858
Let's go over to your place
and cut it up.

863
01:22:31,026 --> 01:22:35,053
- Put it in the bathroom, lock the door...
- Right on the floor.

864
01:22:35,597 --> 01:22:38,430
From now on, when I say go, though, man,
we gotta go, man.

865
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:40,534
- When I yell, "Go," go.
- The clock...

866
01:22:40,702 --> 01:22:43,000
The clock, my ass.
We always go through this shit.

867
01:22:43,171 --> 01:22:46,572
I'll dock you 8 grand you stopped me
from getting from that last teller.

868
01:22:46,741 --> 01:22:48,299
Eight thousand fucking dollars.

869
01:22:48,477 --> 01:22:51,537
It was like pulling teeth
to get you out of the fucking place.

870
01:22:51,713 --> 01:22:53,408
So we scored.

871
01:22:56,017 --> 01:22:59,180
- Do you like it?
- Not really. What are we doing here?

872
01:22:59,354 --> 01:23:01,822
Let me buy you something.
What about the earrings?

873
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:04,049
- I think it's a set.
- Look at the ring.

874
01:23:04,226 --> 01:23:06,490
The price tag on it's $9135.

875
01:23:06,661 --> 01:23:09,926
- I bet that bracelet's worth more than...
- Hello. May I help you?

876
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,865
- How much is that?
- Eighteen thousand.

877
01:23:22,344 --> 01:23:25,404
- What about this one here?
- Forty-seven five for the set.

878
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:28,310
- With tax or without?
- Without tax.

879
01:23:28,483 --> 01:23:30,212
Want a watch?
Where's ladies' watches?

880
01:23:30,385 --> 01:23:32,478
This counter right over here.

881
01:23:33,088 --> 01:23:34,112
What are you doing?

882
01:23:34,289 --> 01:23:36,484
- I'm getting you a watch.
- I don't want a watch.

883
01:23:36,658 --> 01:23:38,250
- Hi.
- Hi. May I show you something?

884
01:23:38,426 --> 01:23:40,485
- Can we see some ladies' watches?
- Certainly.

885
01:23:40,662 --> 01:23:43,790
- This entire counter, all ladies' watches.
- How about your best one?

886
01:23:43,965 --> 01:23:46,729
Best one? Is right here.

887
01:23:48,069 --> 01:23:50,264
- That's all right.
- Isn't that a lovely watch?

888
01:23:50,438 --> 01:23:52,668
It's disgusting.

889
01:23:53,041 --> 01:23:54,906
- Let's see this one here.
- Certainly.

890
01:23:55,076 --> 01:23:57,476
- I don't like those diamonds.
- Let me put this back.

891
01:24:00,749 --> 01:24:02,444
That's nice.

892
01:24:03,952 --> 01:24:06,045
- How much is that?
- That's $2000.

893
01:24:06,221 --> 01:24:07,916
I can't wear that to work.

894
01:24:08,089 --> 01:24:11,718
You'd better show us something
less expensive. She has very simple tastes.

895
01:24:11,893 --> 01:24:13,758
It's my upbringing.
What can I tell you?

896
01:24:13,929 --> 01:24:15,988
Here, let's try this one.

897
01:24:16,431 --> 01:24:18,831
- How much is that one?
- This one is $900.

898
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,163
That's pretty. What make is that?

899
01:24:23,271 --> 01:24:25,865
Sir? Excuse me.

900
01:24:26,608 --> 01:24:28,303
Where are you going?

901
01:24:29,044 --> 01:24:30,875
I was just looking for your restroom.

902
01:24:31,046 --> 01:24:34,777
I'm sorry, but we don't have
a public restroom here.

903
01:24:34,950 --> 01:24:38,647
There's a coffee shop two doors down.
They'll allow you to use their facilities.

904
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:40,879
Thanks. Did you get what you wanted?

905
01:24:41,056 --> 01:24:43,752
- I like this the best.
- We'll have to think about it.

906
01:24:43,925 --> 01:24:45,984
- Very well.
- We'll be back.

907
01:24:46,161 --> 01:24:48,322
- Thank you for coming in.
- Bye-bye.

908
01:24:48,496 --> 01:24:50,521
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye.

909
01:24:50,966 --> 01:24:54,561
- Is there anything else to see upstairs?
- No, those are the executive offices.

910
01:24:54,736 --> 01:24:55,964
All right.

911
01:24:58,506 --> 01:25:01,475
Look, this is Wilshire Boulevard
right here, right?

912
01:25:01,743 --> 01:25:03,472
All right. Here's the doors.

913
01:25:03,645 --> 01:25:07,172
Now, there's glass windows on either side,
and they're tinted, Jerry.

914
01:25:07,349 --> 01:25:09,146
From the outside, you cannot see in.

915
01:25:09,317 --> 01:25:11,478
But inside, you can see
all the action outside.

916
01:25:11,753 --> 01:25:14,187
We didn't have that on the bank, right?

917
01:25:14,756 --> 01:25:17,520
When I was in there,
the lady showed me one case.

918
01:25:17,692 --> 01:25:21,025
In one case, there was over
125 grand of ice there.

919
01:25:21,196 --> 01:25:23,027
In one case?

920
01:25:23,832 --> 01:25:25,527
What do you think?

921
01:25:26,001 --> 01:25:27,935
I don't know.

922
01:25:29,237 --> 01:25:33,003
Beverly Hills is rough, man.
It scares the shit out of me, Beverly Hills.

923
01:25:33,174 --> 01:25:34,163
Why's that?

924
01:25:34,342 --> 01:25:36,810
I don't know.
Well, how many cops they got there?

925
01:25:36,978 --> 01:25:39,640
They got 100 cops
in six square miles, you know.

926
01:25:39,814 --> 01:25:45,343
That's, you know, 20 cops
to the square mile, or whatever it is.

927
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,420
What's the response time?
Three minutes?

928
01:25:47,589 --> 01:25:50,422
- Three minutes?
- What'd make you feel safe in there?

929
01:25:50,592 --> 01:25:53,652
Fuck Beverly Hills.
Fuck those cops, man. They're just cops.

930
01:25:53,828 --> 01:25:57,764
They can't be faster than three minutes.
The alarm goes off when we start sacking.

931
01:25:58,233 --> 01:25:59,928
Let the alarm go.

932
01:26:00,101 --> 01:26:02,729
Would you feel safe
for a minute and a half?

933
01:26:03,772 --> 01:26:07,538
Bob. I gotta get out of here, man.

934
01:26:07,709 --> 01:26:09,404
They're waiting on me.

935
01:26:09,577 --> 01:26:13,946
Hey, tell the old lady that owns the house
to sign this, not her mother, all right?

936
01:26:14,115 --> 01:26:16,140
- All right.
- Right up.

937
01:26:16,317 --> 01:26:19,309
You know next week
you don't have to do that?

938
01:26:19,654 --> 01:26:22,680
- I wanna see you with nice clothes.
- How much longer you gonna be?

939
01:26:22,857 --> 01:26:25,348
- Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.
- Okay.

940
01:26:25,527 --> 01:26:28,724
Don't you wanna tan your face?
You wanna live in that neighborhood?

941
01:26:28,897 --> 01:26:30,159
Don't you want a new car?

942
01:26:30,331 --> 01:26:32,265
You're a thief.
Why don't you be a thief?

943
01:26:35,603 --> 01:26:37,662
Did you like doing that bank?

944
01:26:38,773 --> 01:26:41,742
Did you feel good doing that bank,
holding that shotgun?

945
01:26:42,077 --> 01:26:45,046
- Did you feel good working with me?
- Yeah.

946
01:26:45,213 --> 01:26:47,010
You wanna do it?

947
01:26:47,615 --> 01:26:51,051
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

948
01:26:52,654 --> 01:26:55,589
Yeah. What about a driver?

949
01:27:02,597 --> 01:27:05,122
Mickey Barber, the other night,
introduced me to a guy.

950
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:07,029
I knew his brother.

951
01:27:08,636 --> 01:27:11,002
He said he's a good wheelman.

952
01:27:24,052 --> 01:27:26,020
- How you doing?
- Good.

953
01:27:26,488 --> 01:27:29,980
- Jerry, Willy.
- Hey, man, I've heard a lot about you.

954
01:27:30,258 --> 01:27:33,056
Here. I'll get it for you.

955
01:27:34,896 --> 01:27:36,761
Watch your feet.

956
01:27:36,931 --> 01:27:38,159
- Who is that guy?
- What?

957
01:27:38,333 --> 01:27:39,857
- Is that the guy Mickey sent?
- No.

958
01:27:40,034 --> 01:27:41,262
- No?
- It fell through.

959
01:27:41,436 --> 01:27:44,303
- What do you mean?
- Did you get the plates of the car changed?

960
01:27:44,472 --> 01:27:47,999
The car is one half-hour hot and
the plates are changed. I did everything.

961
01:27:48,176 --> 01:27:51,543
You should have told me. That was wrong.
Do you hear me? That was wrong.

962
01:27:51,713 --> 01:27:55,410
- Where are we going?
- Just keep going. We'll talk about it later.

963
01:28:03,892 --> 01:28:06,588
- Right here?
- Go straight toward it.

964
01:28:06,761 --> 01:28:10,094
All right. Now, you're gonna back in
that first spot there.

965
01:28:11,232 --> 01:28:13,700
Go ahead. Take it easy.

966
01:28:18,506 --> 01:28:21,236
Soon as you get in,
I'll tell you what we're doing.

967
01:28:23,044 --> 01:28:25,410
- Oh, shit, I'm sorry.
- Take it easy, all right?

968
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:29,016
Okay, you see that door over there?
We'll be out in a few minutes.

969
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:32,449
As soon as we're out, open both doors.
We get in and split. You got it?

970
01:28:32,620 --> 01:28:33,951
- Yeah.
- How do you feel?

971
01:28:34,122 --> 01:28:36,147
- Do I keep the car running?
- Yeah. All right?

972
01:28:36,324 --> 01:28:37,757
- I'm okay.
- You ready to hit it?

973
01:28:37,926 --> 01:28:39,826
- Yeah.
- All right, let's go.

974
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:44,521
Just relax, man.

975
01:28:50,371 --> 01:28:51,804
How do you feel?

976
01:28:51,973 --> 01:28:54,066
Feel great. Except for that driver, man.

977
01:28:54,242 --> 01:28:56,073
Don't worry about it.

978
01:28:56,477 --> 01:29:00,038
- You should have told me about it.
- All right, let's do this.

979
01:29:00,982 --> 01:29:02,882
- How's the vibes?
- Everything's all right.

980
01:29:03,051 --> 01:29:06,714
- A lot of traffic, a lot of people.
- I'd kiss you, but you're too ugly.

981
01:29:15,263 --> 01:29:17,458
No, it's too yellow. Thank you.

982
01:29:18,199 --> 01:29:21,362
Well, may I see the 10 mm, please?

983
01:29:21,536 --> 01:29:23,060
Yes.

984
01:29:26,274 --> 01:29:29,471
Well, yes, I like the pink...

985
01:29:30,745 --> 01:29:35,648
- I need a 24-carat ring.
- Well, we can order that. No problem.

986
01:29:37,485 --> 01:29:38,474
What about...?

987
01:29:38,653 --> 01:29:40,348
Pardon me. What are you doing?

988
01:29:40,521 --> 01:29:42,853
Can you step back, please?

989
01:29:48,229 --> 01:29:50,459
Do what you're told
and you won't get hurt.

990
01:29:50,632 --> 01:29:52,657
Get up against the wall! Face the wall!

991
01:30:17,325 --> 01:30:20,294
Sorry, sir. Will you step back in there
before you get shot?

992
01:30:22,463 --> 01:30:24,294
- How do you feel?
- Go ahead, get some.

993
01:30:24,465 --> 01:30:26,956
- We've got a minute and a half.
- Go on, there.

994
01:30:43,718 --> 01:30:45,515
What's the time?

995
01:30:46,354 --> 01:30:49,016
- What's the time?
- One minute.

996
01:30:56,597 --> 01:30:57,859
Get it all.

997
01:31:09,410 --> 01:31:11,503
Twenty seconds to go.

998
01:31:29,430 --> 01:31:30,658
Let's go.

999
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,766
- Let's go! Let's hit it.
- We've got time.

1000
01:31:35,937 --> 01:31:38,405
Time's up! Let's go!

1001
01:31:41,976 --> 01:31:44,467
Hey. Hey, let's go, man.

1002
01:31:45,046 --> 01:31:47,571
Let's go, man.
We've gotta get out of here.

1003
01:31:48,082 --> 01:31:49,606
There was another piece here.

1004
01:31:49,784 --> 01:31:52,776
I don't believe this, man.
I really don't believe this.

1005
01:31:53,054 --> 01:31:55,648
- There's gonna be an army out there, man.
- Where was it?

1006
01:31:55,823 --> 01:31:57,814
- I don't know.
- There was a big piece here.

1007
01:32:01,796 --> 01:32:04,594
This is the last goddamn time, man.
This is it.

1008
01:32:04,766 --> 01:32:08,031
The poker game was the same way,
the driver, the whole goddamn thing.

1009
01:32:08,202 --> 01:32:12,104
This is it. It's all over.

1010
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:16,570
You're a child, man. You act like
a 2-year-old child, for chrissake.

1011
01:32:17,445 --> 01:32:18,878
I know you like a book.

1012
01:32:19,047 --> 01:32:22,346
This is the last goddamn time
I'm working with you. I mean it.

1013
01:32:22,984 --> 01:32:25,919
What are you...? Get over there
and sit down! Put your head down.

1014
01:32:26,087 --> 01:32:27,884
- What are you doing?
- Where's the watch?

1015
01:32:28,056 --> 01:32:30,115
Hey, we gotta get out of here, man!

1016
01:32:33,961 --> 01:32:35,588
Hey! Hey!

1017
01:32:35,763 --> 01:32:39,324
- Listen to me! Listen to me.
- Let go of that. All right, all right!

1018
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:41,593
Give it to me, man.

1019
01:32:42,537 --> 01:32:45,870
- We're going.
- Why don't you take a clock too?

1020
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:49,100
This is the last goddamn time
I'm working with you.

1021
01:32:55,016 --> 01:32:57,541
- Where is he?
- Yeah, where is he?

1022
01:32:57,985 --> 01:33:01,921
Where is he?
Was this part of your goddamn plan?

1023
01:33:05,893 --> 01:33:08,191
Who the fuck knows where he is?

1024
01:33:09,330 --> 01:33:11,730
You're pathetic.
You're a pathetic fucking human being.

1025
01:33:11,899 --> 01:33:14,527
We gotta run. We gotta run.
We gotta run.

1026
01:33:16,037 --> 01:33:18,062
Get rid of the shotgun!

1027
01:33:28,049 --> 01:33:32,179
Walk, walk, walk.
Slow down and walk. Walk.

1028
01:33:32,954 --> 01:33:35,548
- Come on.
- Are we going the right way?

1029
01:33:35,990 --> 01:33:38,550
The car's on the next street.
Come on, we're all right.

1030
01:33:59,213 --> 01:34:01,010
Halt! Police!

1031
01:37:20,581 --> 01:37:23,948
- It's a great line.
- We gotta go. Right now. Come on.

1032
01:37:28,856 --> 01:37:31,017
Excuse me, could you
see this guy for me?

1033
01:37:31,192 --> 01:37:33,183
- Where's your car?
- In the back.

1034
01:37:33,361 --> 01:37:34,953
- Where? Let's go.
- In the back.

1035
01:37:35,129 --> 01:37:38,690
So I'll be back in a second.
What's the matter?

1036
01:37:45,406 --> 01:37:49,433
- Where's your key? Where's your car?
- Keep going. It's over there.

1037
01:37:50,411 --> 01:37:52,902
- Give me the key.
- Just a sec.

1038
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:55,878
- Where are we going?
- Come on.

1039
01:38:04,692 --> 01:38:07,456
- What happened?
- I'll tell you later.

1040
01:38:10,731 --> 01:38:12,756
What are you doing?

1041
01:38:14,602 --> 01:38:16,934
Max, please.

1042
01:38:22,843 --> 01:38:25,573
I gotta stop by and get some money
from a friend.

1043
01:39:12,526 --> 01:39:15,859
Where are you, man? Willy?

1044
01:39:23,637 --> 01:39:25,366
Shit.

1045
01:39:29,510 --> 01:39:31,341
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1046
01:39:31,512 --> 01:39:33,946
I'll fucking hurt your fucking ass.

1047
01:39:35,549 --> 01:39:38,848
Don't tell me "wait." I'm gonna put
your fucking brains on that wall!

1048
01:39:39,019 --> 01:39:42,011
- Let me explain.
- You knew I'd be back, didn't you?

1049
01:39:42,623 --> 01:39:45,319
Please let me explain to you
what happened.

1050
01:39:51,665 --> 01:39:52,893
Go ahead, run it.

1051
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:56,369
I had the car pointed the right way.

1052
01:39:56,537 --> 01:39:58,664
The motor was on.

1053
01:39:59,106 --> 01:40:01,438
I was watching my clock,
I was watching the door.

1054
01:40:01,709 --> 01:40:03,802
The burglar alarm went off
for five minutes.

1055
01:40:03,978 --> 01:40:05,878
That's bullshit, man.

1056
01:40:06,914 --> 01:40:09,041
That's bullshit, man.

1057
01:40:10,584 --> 01:40:14,748
- Max...
- No, no. No, man, I would've been there.

1058
01:40:15,189 --> 01:40:17,020
I'm running because of you, sucker man.

1059
01:40:17,191 --> 01:40:19,785
That shit under the bed?
I went to jail because of you.

1060
01:40:21,362 --> 01:40:22,829
I'm sorry.

1061
01:40:23,397 --> 01:40:26,662
Well, you know, sorry ain't shit now.
You know why?

1062
01:40:28,002 --> 01:40:29,936
It don't mean nothing.

1063
01:40:30,638 --> 01:40:32,230
Come on, Max.

1064
01:40:33,173 --> 01:40:35,733
- Are you high?
- No.

1065
01:40:35,910 --> 01:40:38,401
- Did you get high?
- No.

1066
01:40:40,648 --> 01:40:42,741
Then I don't understand
why you don't hear me.

1067
01:40:42,917 --> 01:40:46,045
I don't understand why you don't
understand what I'm talking about.

1068
01:40:46,220 --> 01:40:47,448
Jerry's dead.

1069
01:40:48,122 --> 01:40:50,283
Just lying on the street, man.

1070
01:40:50,691 --> 01:40:53,489
And that hurts me, man,
because he'd do anything for me.

1071
01:40:53,661 --> 01:40:55,891
He'd do anything for me.

1072
01:40:56,430 --> 01:40:58,489
If he was out in the car, man...

1073
01:40:58,666 --> 01:41:00,827
...there could have been a shitstorm,
you know?

1074
01:41:08,075 --> 01:41:10,066
Max, I'm sorry.

1075
01:41:15,049 --> 01:41:16,949
I got scared.

1076
01:41:18,719 --> 01:41:20,812
I'm scared now.

1077
01:41:22,523 --> 01:41:24,889
You did the best you could, right?

1078
01:41:26,427 --> 01:41:29,555
- I really did.
- I gave you every chance, too, didn't I?

1079
01:41:30,164 --> 01:41:32,428
It wasn't your fault.

1080
01:41:33,667 --> 01:41:35,396
It's over, Willy.

1081
01:41:40,441 --> 01:41:43,410
It's over, man. Forget it.
I shouldn't have asked you to do it.

1082
01:41:43,577 --> 01:41:45,602
It was too heavy for you.

1083
01:41:47,448 --> 01:41:49,780
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right. It's all right, man.

1084
01:41:49,950 --> 01:41:52,817
- What can I do?
- Give me a big bear hug...

1085
01:41:53,020 --> 01:41:55,545
...and just forget it.
- Okay.

1086
01:41:55,756 --> 01:41:57,121
I'm sorry.

1087
01:41:57,291 --> 01:41:59,987
- You were wrong, though, you know.
- I know it.

1088
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:02,094
I'm sorry.

1089
01:42:02,563 --> 01:42:04,155
Shit.

1090
01:42:57,117 --> 01:42:58,778
Did you get it?

1091
01:42:58,952 --> 01:43:00,385
- What?
- The money.

1092
01:43:00,554 --> 01:43:01,885
Yeah.

1093
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:08,123
Where's the freeway?

1094
01:43:08,295 --> 01:43:09,990
I don't know.

1095
01:43:11,465 --> 01:43:13,194
Well, we're going.

1096
01:43:13,734 --> 01:43:16,601
- All right?
- Let's go. Yeah, let's go.

1097
01:43:57,044 --> 01:43:58,841
How you doing?

1098
01:44:00,247 --> 01:44:03,910
- Want me to drive?
- No, I'm all right. Can I have one?

1099
01:44:12,893 --> 01:44:17,262
- This afternoon when a large house trailer
lost its brakes and ran into a schoolyard.

1100
01:44:17,431 --> 01:44:20,332
One man is dead
and one wounded in a gunfight...

1101
01:44:20,501 --> 01:44:24,767
...following a jewelry store holdup
in Beverly Hills earlier this afternoon.

1102
01:44:24,938 --> 01:44:26,235
The robbers, two in number...

1103
01:44:26,406 --> 01:44:29,034
...used hammers to break through
the counters and display cases...

1104
01:44:29,209 --> 01:44:32,576
...in Gindel's, an exclusive
Wilshire Boulevard shop.

1105
01:44:32,746 --> 01:44:35,874
Police arrived just as the robbers
were making their getaway...

1106
01:44:36,049 --> 01:44:37,710
...and in the ensuing gun battle...

1107
01:44:37,885 --> 01:44:42,083
...one of the holdup men,
Jerry Schue, age 48, of Burbank, was killed.

1108
01:44:42,256 --> 01:44:45,692
Also critically wounded in the shootout
was Officer David Post...

1109
01:44:45,859 --> 01:44:47,759
...a two-year veteran of the force.

1110
01:44:47,928 --> 01:44:50,419
The second holdup man,
who made good his escape...

1111
01:44:50,597 --> 01:44:52,155
...has not yet been identified...

1112
01:44:52,332 --> 01:44:55,733
...but police officials are currently
assembling a detailed description...

1113
01:44:55,903 --> 01:44:58,269
...from eyewitnesses on the scene.

1114
01:44:58,438 --> 01:45:00,235
Look for another
smoggy day tomorrow...

1115
01:45:00,407 --> 01:45:04,309
...according to the Air Quality
Management District. Temperatures...

1116
01:45:21,461 --> 01:45:23,622
We didn't start the shooting.

1117
01:45:32,506 --> 01:45:35,669
- Would you pull over for a second?
- Why?

1118
01:45:35,843 --> 01:45:37,572
Please pull over. I don't feel well.

1119
01:45:37,744 --> 01:45:41,646
- Wait till we get to a gas station, will you?
- I can't wait, Max.

1120
01:45:44,818 --> 01:45:47,844
Pull the fucking car over, goddamn it!

1121
01:45:48,488 --> 01:45:51,719
Max, don't you dare lay
a fucking hand on me!

1122
01:46:31,498 --> 01:46:34,399
- What do you wanna do with this?
- I got it.

1123
01:46:36,904 --> 01:46:39,134
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

1124
01:46:39,573 --> 01:46:43,100
Fill it up with regular and you better
check the oil. I think that's all.

1125
01:46:57,591 --> 01:46:59,149
- Want something to drink?
- Yeah.

1126
01:46:59,326 --> 01:47:02,193
Just get me a ginger ale.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

1127
01:47:04,097 --> 01:47:07,533
- You wanna give us a ginger ale and a beer?
- What kind of beer?

1128
01:47:07,701 --> 01:47:09,896
- It doesn't matter. We'll be over here.
- Yeah. Anyway...

1129
01:47:10,070 --> 01:47:13,267
...he starts back to her at the door
and I think he's not gonna say anything.

1130
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:15,806
And he looks up at me
with the football helmet...

1131
01:47:15,976 --> 01:47:19,742
...and he says, "Lady,
I sure hope your team wins."

1132
01:47:44,838 --> 01:47:48,638
- Here we are, sir. Here you go.
- Thank you.

1133
01:47:48,809 --> 01:47:51,778
- And can I get you something else?
- No, that's okay.

1134
01:47:51,979 --> 01:47:54,072
I got some fine
homemade chili for you.

1135
01:47:54,247 --> 01:47:58,013
- This'll do it.
- All right. That'll be 90 cents, if you please.

1136
01:47:58,185 --> 01:48:00,312
I saw a sign outside.
Is there a bus stop here?

1137
01:48:00,487 --> 01:48:03,149
Yeah. That would be
the local Palmdale transportation.

1138
01:48:03,323 --> 01:48:04,585
It stops twice a day.

1139
01:48:04,758 --> 01:48:09,718
The schedule's kind of irregular, but...
Where were you going?

1140
01:48:12,132 --> 01:48:14,726
- Where you kids going, honey?
- L.A.

1141
01:48:15,736 --> 01:48:21,038
Oh, L.A. You take the Palmdale bus from
here, as I say, and go down into Palmdale.

1142
01:48:21,208 --> 01:48:24,666
- Make your connection to L.A. There.
- What time does it get here?

1143
01:48:24,845 --> 01:48:26,904
You got about half an hour.

1144
01:48:27,080 --> 01:48:28,513
- I'll get your change.
- Keep it.

1145
01:48:28,682 --> 01:48:30,843
Oh, thanks, yeah.

1146
01:48:37,758 --> 01:48:39,817
You sending me home?

1147
01:48:43,764 --> 01:48:45,698
Yeah, you are.

1148
01:48:57,844 --> 01:49:00,404
Please, Max, I don't want any money.

1149
01:49:03,116 --> 01:49:04,981
I want you to have it.

1150
01:49:17,898 --> 01:49:19,627
What are you gonna do?

1151
01:49:27,441 --> 01:49:29,341
Will you call me?

1152
01:49:49,830 --> 01:49:51,388
Gotta go.

1153
01:50:19,326 --> 01:50:21,294
Forgot my sweater.

1154
01:50:25,198 --> 01:50:26,825
Why can't I go with you?

1155
01:50:28,568 --> 01:50:30,433
Because I wanna get caught.

1156
01:54:05,003 --> 01:54:06,174
