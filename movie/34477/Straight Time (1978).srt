1
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:53,246
Open the gate.

2
00:00:58,918 --> 00:01:00,920
You guys wanna step up to the table?

3
00:01:13,224 --> 00:01:14,892
Open the gate, please.

4
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:25,606
- Can I help you?
- A dog.

5
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:27,483
Everything on it?

6
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:47,753
Hey. Hey. Sixty-five cents.

7
00:04:57,198 --> 00:04:59,200
Mr. Frank, please.

8
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,996
No.

9
00:05:05,831 --> 00:05:10,169
Well, my name's Dembo, A-20284.

10
00:05:12,755 --> 00:05:16,175
Dembo, A-20284. Okay?

11
00:05:16,342 --> 00:05:19,720
Just tell him that I'm here and I'll just--
I'll see him tomorrow morning.

12
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:22,807
I got an appointment with him.
Nothing important.

13
00:05:22,974 --> 00:05:24,934
Yeah, okay. Thank you.

14
00:06:33,044 --> 00:06:34,128
- Hi, Max.
- Hi.

15
00:06:34,295 --> 00:06:35,796
Earl Frank.

16
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:37,298
Come on in.

17
00:06:41,344 --> 00:06:42,595
Have a seat.

18
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:47,016
- You're a little late.
- I had some trouble getting down here.

19
00:06:47,183 --> 00:06:49,769
- Want a coffee?
- Yeah, thanks.

20
00:06:50,394 --> 00:06:51,646
Black.

21
00:06:55,608 --> 00:06:59,153
So fill me in. How was the trip?

22
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,573
On the bus down? It was a little long.

23
00:07:03,366 --> 00:07:06,744
- We made about 27 stops.
- Yeah, it's a real milk train.

24
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:08,829
Go ahead. Put it down on the floor.

25
00:07:10,122 --> 00:07:11,874
So, what'd you do last night?

26
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,001
Oh, walked around.

27
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:17,630
- Meet anybody?
- No, nobody I know.

28
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:20,258
Where'd you stay?
You didn't go to the halfway house.

29
00:07:20,424 --> 00:07:23,052
- I called. Didn't you get the message?
- You called here?

30
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:26,013
Last night. I left a message
with your answering service.

31
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,015
- I didn't get it.
- I left it.

32
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:29,225
So where'd you sleep?

33
00:07:29,809 --> 00:07:31,018
In a motel.

34
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:34,230
The conditions of your parole
were that you were to go to the house.

35
00:07:34,397 --> 00:07:36,065
That's a way to help you save money.

36
00:07:36,232 --> 00:07:38,317
Now, you agreed to that
before your release.

37
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:39,610
Why didn't you go there?

38
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:42,238
Because I just spent six years
in prison.

39
00:07:42,405 --> 00:07:45,575
I just wanted to look at the lights.
I wanted to feel free.

40
00:07:45,741 --> 00:07:47,410
I wanted to walk around...

41
00:07:47,577 --> 00:07:50,997
...and not have somebody tell me
that I gotta get in bed at 1 0:00.

42
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:54,750
Max, I think you've got
a serious attitude problem.

43
00:07:55,126 --> 00:07:57,211
I don't have an attitude.

44
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:01,966
Can you tell me what kind of attitude
you want me to have?

45
00:08:02,174 --> 00:08:05,136
Well, you don't decide whether or not
you go to a halfway house.

46
00:08:05,344 --> 00:08:08,180
I mean, you come to me,
we discuss it, then I decide.

47
00:08:09,015 --> 00:08:13,185
I'm just trying to make you understand that
I'm aware of the realities of my situation...

48
00:08:13,394 --> 00:08:16,522
...that I'm not fated
to be a menace to society.

49
00:08:16,772 --> 00:08:19,191
I'm not gonna go out
and hit somebody over the head.

50
00:08:19,817 --> 00:08:23,362
My friend, I see that you're gonna
force me to deal with you.

51
00:08:25,656 --> 00:08:30,202
I see that you've got juvenile offenses
dating back to when you were 1 2.

52
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:33,289
I see you've got auto theft,
you've got breaking and entering.

53
00:08:33,456 --> 00:08:35,416
All this leading up to
a burglary warrant.

54
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,877
I just served six years
for that chickenshit rap.

55
00:08:38,044 --> 00:08:41,380
Chickenshit? You had a gun.

56
00:08:41,923 --> 00:08:44,467
Yeah, but I didn't use it
and I didn't hurt nobody.

57
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:47,970
What was in your mind
when you put it in your pocket?

58
00:08:54,185 --> 00:08:56,103
I just took it along.

59
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,525
I'm due in court.

60
00:09:02,151 --> 00:09:05,321
I'm aware that you have this power,
that you represent the state...

61
00:09:05,488 --> 00:09:08,407
...but, you know, I think that
you can give me a little leeway.

62
00:09:08,574 --> 00:09:09,909
You can be flexible.

63
00:09:10,076 --> 00:09:12,245
I was just hoping
to get some trust from you.

64
00:09:12,787 --> 00:09:14,830
You've gotta earn the trust.

65
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:18,417
I have. I just wanna
be like everybody else.

66
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:22,046
I just want a decent job.
I want a decent place to live.

67
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:25,091
I want somebody to love me,
I want some clothes on my back...

68
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:28,469
- ...have some self-respect.
- I gotta get going now.

69
00:09:28,678 --> 00:09:30,846
I tried to be straight with you, sir.

70
00:09:31,013 --> 00:09:34,642
I know I shouldn't have done that last night
without checking with you first.

71
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:36,060
I'm sorry.

72
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,608
I'm sorry.

73
00:09:47,989 --> 00:09:49,782
I'll make a deal with you, Max.

74
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:53,119
If you find a place to sleep today
and a job by the end of the week...

75
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:55,621
...you don't have to go
to a halfway house. Fair?

76
00:09:55,955 --> 00:09:58,040
That's fair. I appreciate that.

77
00:09:58,207 --> 00:10:01,711
When you find a place, you call
Miss DeVeccio and give her the address.

78
00:10:01,877 --> 00:10:03,796
I'm gonna see you one day this week.

79
00:10:03,963 --> 00:10:05,172
That's okay.

80
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,758
Here's the other hundred
you've got coming to you.

81
00:10:07,925 --> 00:10:10,303
I want you to sign for it.

82
00:10:12,054 --> 00:10:14,473
Now, do you understand
the conditions of your parole?

83
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,101
- Yes, I do.
- You have to attend all meetings.

84
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:20,605
You must heed the advice
and the counsel of your agent.

85
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,442
- Now, do you know what that means?
- Yeah, I think I do.

86
00:10:24,609 --> 00:10:28,321
I gotta get along with you
or you're gonna throw me back in jail.

87
00:10:28,487 --> 00:10:29,864
That's it in a nutshell.

88
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:33,159
- You're a tough man.
- No, I'm not, Max.

89
00:10:33,618 --> 00:10:35,328
All right, I gotta go now.

90
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:38,331
- Good luck with it, now, huh?
- Okay.

91
00:10:38,497 --> 00:10:40,374
I'm gonna do my best.

92
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,793
I know you're gonna do it.

93
00:11:33,511 --> 00:11:36,555
- How much?
- Eighteen dollars a week.

94
00:11:38,891 --> 00:11:40,309
Okay.

95
00:11:53,781 --> 00:11:55,950
- Here's your key.
- Clean sheets?

96
00:11:56,117 --> 00:11:59,245
No. Bathroom is over there.

97
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,567
<i>Parole office. May I help you?</i>

98
00:12:29,734 --> 00:12:31,527
Could you leave a message
for Mr. Frank?

99
00:12:31,694 --> 00:12:36,782
<i>-Who's calling?
- My name is Max Dembo, A-20284.</i>

100
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,201
<i>-What?
- I got that.</i>

101
00:12:39,368 --> 00:12:41,537
<i>-A-20284.
- Thank you.</i>

102
00:12:41,704 --> 00:12:43,748
Could you tell him I'm
at the Garland Hotel?

103
00:12:43,915 --> 00:12:46,292
That's G-A-R-L-A-N-D.

104
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,254
And you'd better give him
the phone number. It's 321 -1 321 .

105
00:12:50,421 --> 00:12:53,883
<i>-I'll give him the message.
- I'd appreciate it if he gets it today.</i>

106
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:57,678
<i>-I'll give him the message, sir.
- Okay, thank you. Bye-bye.</i>

107
00:13:32,296 --> 00:13:34,006
Time's up.

108
00:13:35,216 --> 00:13:37,009
Time's up.

109
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,474
- Time's up. I'm sorry.
- I just wanted to finish that sentence.

110
00:13:43,641 --> 00:13:45,559
Bring those score sheets.

111
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:51,857
You did great
on your intelligence test.

112
00:13:52,024 --> 00:13:54,527
Yeah, well, you know.
I could have told you that.

113
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,612
One moment.

114
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,782
Wilshire Agency.

115
00:14:00,032 --> 00:14:01,617
Yes, she is. Hold on.

116
00:14:01,784 --> 00:14:03,619
Pat, it's for you.

117
00:14:04,245 --> 00:14:06,789
- Did you put it on hold, honey?
- Yeah.

118
00:14:06,956 --> 00:14:08,040
Hello?

119
00:14:08,457 --> 00:14:11,168
Disconnected. I lost the call.

120
00:14:11,335 --> 00:14:15,464
You're supposed to push down ''Hold''
before you use these other buttons.

121
00:14:15,631 --> 00:14:19,093
- There's ''Hold,'' there's the buttons.
- Okay.

122
00:14:19,885 --> 00:14:21,721
I'm sorry.

123
00:14:24,515 --> 00:14:27,560
- Did you just get this job?
- Yeah. I've had it about a week.

124
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,688
- Is she your boss?
- Yeah.

125
00:14:31,898 --> 00:14:34,942
Does she really like you
as much as she seems to?

126
00:14:36,152 --> 00:14:38,321
I guess. I don't know.

127
00:14:38,487 --> 00:14:41,490
You got a 61 on your typing test.

128
00:14:42,617 --> 00:14:45,369
- Is that bad?
- I'm afraid it's a little low.

129
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:47,330
Well, I'm not used to the electric.

130
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,791
What was your last
place of employment?

131
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,210
Were you self-employed
or in the armed services?

132
00:14:53,544 --> 00:14:58,090
No. I didn't know whether to put down
''state penitentiary.''

133
00:15:01,844 --> 00:15:03,804
I was a convict.

134
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:07,892
And how long
did you hold that position?

135
00:15:10,061 --> 00:15:13,189
Approximately six years. No vacation.

136
00:15:15,524 --> 00:15:17,235
What'd you do?

137
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:20,780
Burglary.

138
00:15:22,073 --> 00:15:25,910
You know, I know I fouled up
that typing test...

139
00:15:26,077 --> 00:15:29,205
...but I do know how
to work a manual...

140
00:15:29,372 --> 00:15:32,875
...and if you get any calls
for a manual typist...

141
00:15:33,042 --> 00:15:34,961
...I'd appreciate it, you know?

142
00:15:35,127 --> 00:15:36,629
Well, I'll see what I can do.

143
00:15:36,837 --> 00:15:38,547
All I wanna....

144
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:43,469
All I wanna do is get a job.

145
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,057
I need a fucking job.

146
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,352
I believe you.

147
00:15:54,272 --> 00:15:56,232
Well, let me see.

148
00:15:57,441 --> 00:15:59,485
I'm sorry to be a problem.

149
00:15:59,652 --> 00:16:02,238
You know, like I can't drive a car
without permission.

150
00:16:02,405 --> 00:16:04,865
- Why not?
- Well, it's a parole restriction.

151
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:09,829
I can't handle money, you know,
and it's like I'm limited...

152
00:16:09,996 --> 00:16:12,748
...in terms of what they allow me to do.

153
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:15,501
Is there anything at all?

154
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,129
How about the National Can Company?

155
00:16:18,296 --> 00:16:21,507
- Do you think they'd let you work there?
- Yeah.

156
00:16:21,882 --> 00:16:26,429
- I think that would be all right with them.
- It's not much. It's only scale.

157
00:16:26,596 --> 00:16:28,931
You wanna try? Okay.

158
00:16:29,098 --> 00:16:31,559
Let's see what we've got here.

159
00:16:31,976 --> 00:16:34,937
Well, go here and see what they say.

160
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:43,029
Listen, if I get this job,
can I celebrate by taking you to dinner?

161
00:16:44,947 --> 00:16:46,699
You're not sure?

162
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:50,369
Is that a half yes?

163
00:16:52,246 --> 00:16:53,873
I guess so.

164
00:16:54,874 --> 00:16:56,918
When you go there,
I hope you get the job.

165
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:58,711
- Thanks for your time.
- Good luck.

166
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,006
- Thank you.
- Let me know what happens.

167
00:17:02,298 --> 00:17:03,716
Okay.

168
00:18:18,207 --> 00:18:21,168
<i>-Hello? Who is it?
- Who is this?</i>

169
00:18:21,335 --> 00:18:22,670
<i>This is Henry Darin.</i>

170
00:18:22,837 --> 00:18:25,298
<i>-Henry Darin? I've heard about you.
- Yeah.</i>

171
00:18:25,464 --> 00:18:27,341
<i>-Is your daddy there?
- Yeah.</i>

172
00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:31,053
Well, you tell him that somebody
wants to give the big bear a bear hug.

173
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,555
<i>-Who is it?
- Just tell him...</i>

174
00:18:32,722 --> 00:18:35,725
...somebody wants to give the big bear
a bear hug. He'll know.

175
00:18:35,891 --> 00:18:40,313
<i>Dad! Someone wants to give you
a big-bear big bear hug!</i>

176
00:18:43,691 --> 00:18:45,067
<i>-Hello?
- Willy?</i>

177
00:18:45,234 --> 00:18:46,819
<i>-Yeah?
- It's Max.</i>

178
00:18:47,028 --> 00:18:48,237
<i>Dembo?</i>

179
00:18:48,404 --> 00:18:50,239
<i>-How you doing?
- Max, thank-- Goddamn.</i>

180
00:18:50,406 --> 00:18:51,824
<i>-Is that your boy?
- Yeah.</i>

181
00:18:51,991 --> 00:18:54,410
The last time you wrote,
he was learning how to walk.

182
00:18:54,577 --> 00:18:56,245
<i>Well, where the hell are you?</i>

183
00:18:56,412 --> 00:18:58,581
I got no wheels yet.
You wanna come get me?

184
00:18:58,748 --> 00:19:00,041
<i>Yes! Tell me where you are.</i>

185
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:02,710
Well, why don't I meet you
on 7th and AIvarado?

186
00:19:02,877 --> 00:19:05,129
<i>-If I'm not there, wait for me, all right?
- Okay.</i>

187
00:19:05,296 --> 00:19:06,756
<i>-You coming now?
- I'm coming now.</i>

188
00:19:06,923 --> 00:19:09,425
<i>-Okay. I'll see you.
- Okay. Yeah.</i>

189
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:29,862
- How you doing?
- Good. Get in the back, Bart. In the back!

190
00:19:30,696 --> 00:19:34,367
- How you doing? Good to see you.
- It's going well.

191
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:37,411
Good. Rock 'n' roll!

192
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,794
- How you doing?
- Doing good.

193
00:19:45,253 --> 00:19:47,630
- You working?
- I'm riveting.

194
00:19:47,797 --> 00:19:50,925
Kitchens and bathrooms
in portable homes.

195
00:19:52,802 --> 00:19:54,178
How'd you get the job?

196
00:19:54,553 --> 00:19:57,223
Well, when I came out,
the parole officer got it for me...

197
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:01,477
...and when I got off parole, Selma said,
''It's good enough. Why don't you keep it?''

198
00:20:01,644 --> 00:20:04,230
You'll be a riveter
the rest of your life, man.

199
00:20:04,397 --> 00:20:06,566
Shit, no, man.
I'm working on my time.

200
00:20:06,774 --> 00:20:09,151
I'm getting my drums together.
I'm gonna play.

201
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:11,279
Holy Jesus!

202
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:14,740
- Are you the one I talked to on the phone?
- Shake hands with Max Dembo.

203
00:20:14,907 --> 00:20:16,659
- This is my son, Henry.
- How you doing?

204
00:20:16,826 --> 00:20:18,953
Tell him a knock-knock joke.
He's got tons.

205
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,497
- Knock-knock.
- Who's there?

206
00:20:22,123 --> 00:20:24,458
- You.
- You who?

207
00:20:24,709 --> 00:20:25,918
Gotcha. I know that one.

208
00:20:42,894 --> 00:20:45,021
Hey, look what I found downtown, Mama.

209
00:20:45,187 --> 00:20:46,564
Henry.

210
00:20:46,856 --> 00:20:49,901
- Come on, Bart!
- Get inside there.

211
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:52,320
- Hello, Max.
- Hi, Selma.

212
00:20:52,486 --> 00:20:55,114
- You didn't bring any beer, did you?
- Was I supposed to?

213
00:20:55,323 --> 00:20:56,991
- I got it.
- Good.

214
00:20:57,158 --> 00:20:58,618
How about some spaghetti?

215
00:20:58,784 --> 00:21:02,246
- Get inside. Get in, come on.
- Oh, God. Jesus, come on inside.

216
00:21:02,496 --> 00:21:06,542
- Come on, come on. Get in.
- God dog, that smells good.

217
00:21:07,627 --> 00:21:10,963
Show Max your muscle.
Make it. Make it big.

218
00:21:11,172 --> 00:21:12,965
Pretty hard. Let me see the other one.

219
00:21:13,132 --> 00:21:15,259
Make two of them.
Two of them at once, here.

220
00:21:15,426 --> 00:21:17,136
You work out?

221
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:20,431
Does he work out? Come here.

222
00:21:20,598 --> 00:21:23,851
- Show Max what we do on Saturdays.
- You teaching him to defend himself?

223
00:21:24,018 --> 00:21:26,062
You bet your ass. On our days off.

224
00:21:26,229 --> 00:21:27,980
- How could you teach him?
- Got one in.

225
00:21:28,189 --> 00:21:30,107
Got one in there. Come on.

226
00:21:34,403 --> 00:21:36,364
- Okay, okay.
- He's gonna whip your ass.

227
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:37,949
Where's them cigars?

228
00:21:38,115 --> 00:21:40,326
Hey. I told....

229
00:21:43,454 --> 00:21:44,538
So he's....

230
00:21:44,705 --> 00:21:47,583
Don't be hitting me
when I'm not looking at you.

231
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,086
Oh, he's just playing.

232
00:21:54,507 --> 00:21:56,342
You defend yourself pretty good there.

233
00:21:56,509 --> 00:21:59,929
- You been in many fights?
- Yeah, 1 0.

234
00:22:00,096 --> 00:22:04,183
- Ten? Not bad. How many have you won?
- Eighteen.

235
00:22:04,392 --> 00:22:07,687
Really? That's not a bad record.

236
00:22:11,023 --> 00:22:13,192
Eighteen out of 1 0.

237
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:17,321
Hey, how you feel?
You wanna go out and hit the tubs?

238
00:22:17,488 --> 00:22:18,531
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

239
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:21,742
I think he'd better go in
and clean up his room now.

240
00:22:22,243 --> 00:22:25,705
Selma, let me have about 1 0 minutes
with him, because I wanna make it--

241
00:22:25,913 --> 00:22:27,748
- I didn't mean to get mad.
- I know.

242
00:22:27,915 --> 00:22:30,960
- He's gotta get to bed early, okay?
- Just let-- We--

243
00:22:31,252 --> 00:22:33,421
Let him go in
and clean up his room, okay?

244
00:22:33,588 --> 00:22:35,840
He's gotta get up early
tomorrow morning.

245
00:22:38,175 --> 00:22:40,636
- Okay?
- Okay.

246
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:46,809
Come here. I get a kiss.

247
00:22:47,476 --> 00:22:51,105
- I get one too. Good night.
- Give Max a kiss. That's it.

248
00:22:52,273 --> 00:22:54,358
Everybody gets a kiss.

249
00:22:54,525 --> 00:22:56,694
- Hey, I'm sorry.
- Okay.

250
00:22:56,861 --> 00:22:58,070
I didn't mean to get mad.

251
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,488
Okay?

252
00:23:00,948 --> 00:23:03,242
Didn't mean to get mad at you.

253
00:23:04,785 --> 00:23:08,247
See you later. Excuse me.

254
00:23:08,831 --> 00:23:11,500
I'll be getting that board together.

255
00:23:18,007 --> 00:23:19,675
You got any more coffee?

256
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,480
That Henry is a nice boy.

257
00:23:32,647 --> 00:23:34,315
Yes, he is.

258
00:23:37,944 --> 00:23:39,904
Come here, man. Get up here.

259
00:23:40,112 --> 00:23:41,322
Come on. Get up here.

260
00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:43,991
Come on. Get up here.

261
00:23:44,242 --> 00:23:46,535
Sit up here. Smart dog.

262
00:23:46,702 --> 00:23:48,204
Come here.

263
00:23:48,746 --> 00:23:51,666
Want something to eat?
Okay if I give him some ice cream?

264
00:23:51,832 --> 00:23:53,626
Sure. He'll eat anything,

265
00:23:53,793 --> 00:23:56,879
Next time I'm down here,
I'm gonna bring him a steak bone.

266
00:23:57,046 --> 00:24:00,508
In fact, as soon as Willy turns his back,
I'm gonna steal this dog.

267
00:24:00,675 --> 00:24:03,261
You know, Max,
I don't wanna hurt your feelings...

268
00:24:03,427 --> 00:24:06,138
...but your being around here
is kind of bad timing for us.

269
00:24:06,305 --> 00:24:07,848
Why is that?

270
00:24:08,641 --> 00:24:12,395
Well, Willy's been doing real good,
you know.

271
00:24:12,562 --> 00:24:16,732
He's been doing real fine.
He's been working hard lately.

272
00:24:17,358 --> 00:24:21,195
And I know you're good friends
and he really loves you...

273
00:24:22,697 --> 00:24:25,992
...but I just don't think it's good
that he see you right now.

274
00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:28,202
You know what I mean?

275
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:31,163
You trying to tell me
you don't want me to come here no more?

276
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:36,586
I don't mean to be unkind...

277
00:24:38,671 --> 00:24:42,800
...but I just think it's better that he doesn't
get around other influences and stuff.

278
00:25:01,861 --> 00:25:04,447
You're on parole now, Max.

279
00:25:04,739 --> 00:25:08,117
Well, you really shouldn't even
be seen with Willy, right?

280
00:25:10,202 --> 00:25:11,829
I think I get the message.

281
00:25:14,165 --> 00:25:16,292
You make me feel bad.

282
00:25:16,626 --> 00:25:20,463
Why? You're just doing
what you have to do, Selma.

283
00:25:20,922 --> 00:25:22,548
It's no problem.

284
00:25:23,966 --> 00:25:25,468
It's cool.

285
00:25:40,942 --> 00:25:42,526
This is it.

286
00:25:47,365 --> 00:25:49,659
- Here. Let me get it.
- I'll get the front.

287
00:25:49,825 --> 00:25:51,577
- You sure?
- Yeah.

288
00:25:51,744 --> 00:25:55,122
- All right. It's three flights up.
- I gotta piss, so you'd better run.

289
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:56,749
All right.

290
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:09,512
Remember that place called The Hague?
Right across from the Cocoanut Grove.

291
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,265
- Where do you want it?
- Put it underneath the bed there.

292
00:26:12,431 --> 00:26:15,977
Every time I was there, Hampton Hawes
and Chet Baker were playing there.

293
00:26:16,143 --> 00:26:18,062
- Is it still open?
- I don't know.

294
00:26:18,229 --> 00:26:22,692
- Three flights of stairs killed me.
- Go back in the joint, you'll get in shape.

295
00:26:22,858 --> 00:26:24,944
- Hold it up.
- I got it.

296
00:26:25,695 --> 00:26:29,323
- You sure it don't have termites?
- It's okay.

297
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:33,244
How does it feel?
That's the main thing.

298
00:26:33,411 --> 00:26:34,745
It's good, isn't it?

299
00:26:34,912 --> 00:26:36,831
I know where we could go.

300
00:26:36,998 --> 00:26:39,959
- The Autoway Club.
- The what?

301
00:26:40,126 --> 00:26:42,795
The Autoway Club. Remember that?
We used to go there?

302
00:26:42,962 --> 00:26:45,172
- We could go.
- Do a little fucking around, maybe.

303
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:47,842
Yeah. Maybe we could
go to Hermosa Beach too.

304
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:49,635
Oh, yeah.

305
00:26:50,177 --> 00:26:52,555
- Howard Rumsey...
- Yeah.

306
00:26:52,722 --> 00:26:54,765
...and his Lighthouse All-Stars.

307
00:26:54,932 --> 00:26:58,895
All right, let's go there. Maybe there'll be
some nice little girls there I can....

308
00:27:05,026 --> 00:27:07,153
You can get me three years for that.

309
00:27:10,364 --> 00:27:11,782
Sorry.

310
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,127
I got excited, that's all.

311
00:27:23,294 --> 00:27:25,588
Does Selma know you're using?

312
00:27:25,755 --> 00:27:28,215
Well, she's always suspicious.

313
00:28:34,574 --> 00:28:37,159
The machine broke down,
so I gotta stay.

314
00:28:38,035 --> 00:28:42,373
What do you want me to tell you?
I'll probably be about two or three hours.

315
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,250
Well, I'm glad.

316
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:46,252
All right. Bye.

317
00:29:08,691 --> 00:29:12,403
<i>-Hello. Jenny Mercer speaking.
- Hi. How you doing? This is Max Dembo.</i>

318
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:15,156
Thank you for making me
a bona fide member of society.

319
00:29:15,323 --> 00:29:17,742
<i>Oh, you got the job? That's great.</i>

320
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:20,244
<i>-Why don't you have dinner with me?
- When?</i>

321
00:29:20,411 --> 00:29:24,081
I could be there in an hour and a half.
I wanna go home and shower and change.

322
00:29:24,248 --> 00:29:26,459
<i>Actually, I was planning on
staying home tonight.</i>

323
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:29,879
It's just that it's the first chance I have
to celebrate something.

324
00:29:30,046 --> 00:29:31,797
You know? I want to--

325
00:29:31,964 --> 00:29:35,134
You know, I wanna have a steak.
I thought you could keep me company.

326
00:29:35,343 --> 00:29:39,347
<i>-I don't even know what to order.
- Okay.</i>

327
00:29:39,513 --> 00:29:40,932
<i>-Is that okay?
- Yeah.</i>

328
00:29:41,098 --> 00:29:45,978
All right, can I be at your office,
let's say about 5:30?

329
00:29:46,145 --> 00:29:47,355
<i>-See you then.
- All right.</i>

330
00:29:47,521 --> 00:29:49,482
<i>-Bye.
- Bye-bye.</i>

331
00:29:53,486 --> 00:29:57,657
All I'm saying is, out here, the rules
aren't defined. On the inside, they are.

332
00:29:57,823 --> 00:30:01,452
If you don't pay back your debts, if you
owe a couple packs of cigarettes...

333
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:05,623
...if you take somebody's glove or
if you lie to someone, then you get killed.

334
00:30:06,207 --> 00:30:08,876
You know that's the rules,
so you live by them.

335
00:30:09,252 --> 00:30:13,089
You can get killed with a sharp edge...

336
00:30:13,256 --> 00:30:15,049
...the end of this spoon.

337
00:30:15,216 --> 00:30:16,759
That's a lethal weapon.

338
00:30:16,926 --> 00:30:18,678
Even the end of a toothbrush.

339
00:30:18,886 --> 00:30:23,349
You can get hit in the yard
or you can get it in the shower.

340
00:30:23,766 --> 00:30:28,980
If you're in your cell sleeping, someone
can go by with a can of gas and throw it in.

341
00:30:29,146 --> 00:30:31,482
Somebody else throws in a match
and you're torched.

342
00:30:31,649 --> 00:30:34,944
You know that's the reality
and you're living with it 24 hours a day.

343
00:30:35,861 --> 00:30:37,071
That's frightening.

344
00:30:37,238 --> 00:30:40,324
A lot of guys think this is more frightening,
being on the outside.

345
00:30:40,491 --> 00:30:42,994
Why? I don't understand.

346
00:30:43,911 --> 00:30:47,832
Because out here, it's what you
got in your pocket that matters...

347
00:30:47,999 --> 00:30:51,002
...and on the inside,
it's only what you are.

348
00:30:51,752 --> 00:30:53,337
You're glad to be out, aren't you?

349
00:30:57,925 --> 00:31:04,223
It's like a dream.
It's every con's fantasy to be out here.

350
00:31:04,932 --> 00:31:11,188
I can't tell you the number of times
I thought about a scene just like this...

351
00:31:13,816 --> 00:31:18,112
...but I never thought I'd be sitting here
with a knot in my stomach.

352
00:31:22,116 --> 00:31:24,243
Tell me more about that guy
you were going with.

353
00:31:24,452 --> 00:31:26,120
How long were you with him?

354
00:31:26,787 --> 00:31:29,749
I lived with him for about two years.

355
00:31:29,916 --> 00:31:31,918
Who broke it off?

356
00:31:32,126 --> 00:31:33,961
I did.

357
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:37,381
Thank you very much.
Come on back again.

358
00:31:39,634 --> 00:31:43,429
Wanna know something?
I'm glad you asked me out.

359
00:31:49,352 --> 00:31:51,729
Don't you have enough money?

360
00:31:52,521 --> 00:31:55,066
I think I got enough for the tax.

361
00:31:55,775 --> 00:31:56,984
Here, I've got some.

362
00:31:57,151 --> 00:32:00,279
Wait a minute.
I wanted this to be my treat.

363
00:32:02,031 --> 00:32:04,325
Why don't we just walk out?

364
00:32:04,784 --> 00:32:07,328
You don't wanna do that, do you?

365
00:32:07,745 --> 00:32:11,624
I'll make you a deal. If you'll go out with me
tomorrow night, I'll let you help me.

366
00:32:13,292 --> 00:32:15,544
Okay, you've got a deal.

367
00:32:16,504 --> 00:32:20,049
All right, be discreet
and slip it under the table.

368
00:33:37,585 --> 00:33:38,794
Hi, how you doing?

369
00:33:40,087 --> 00:33:41,297
Okay.

370
00:33:41,464 --> 00:33:44,425
I was in the neighborhood,
so I had your manager let me in.

371
00:33:44,592 --> 00:33:47,845
- Mind if I come in?
- Sure. Come on, it's your home.

372
00:33:48,012 --> 00:33:50,223
I mean, this is just routine, you know.

373
00:33:50,431 --> 00:33:53,434
It's a nice room.
You've got cross-ventilation. Nice view.

374
00:33:53,601 --> 00:33:56,646
- Yeah, it's nice.
- What they charge you for?

375
00:33:56,812 --> 00:33:59,357
It's $ 1 7 a week.

376
00:33:59,523 --> 00:34:02,401
- That's better than $ 1 7 in a motel.
- Yeah.

377
00:34:02,568 --> 00:34:03,945
- You're right.
- I know.

378
00:34:04,111 --> 00:34:07,156
Do you mind if I change?
I gotta be somewhere in a half-hour.

379
00:34:07,323 --> 00:34:10,368
No, go right ahead.
Don't let me hold you up. Go ahead.

380
00:34:11,494 --> 00:34:13,120
- What do you got, a date?
- Yeah.

381
00:34:13,287 --> 00:34:14,914
Is she white?

382
00:34:15,122 --> 00:34:17,333
I'm just joking.

383
00:34:19,293 --> 00:34:20,836
So...

384
00:34:21,003 --> 00:34:22,255
...who is she?

385
00:34:22,421 --> 00:34:25,049
I met her at the employment agency.
She works there.

386
00:34:25,216 --> 00:34:29,220
In fact, she sent me for a job
and I went over there and I got it.

387
00:34:29,428 --> 00:34:32,348
Great. Great. What kind of work is it?

388
00:34:32,515 --> 00:34:34,350
Well, it's just a can company,
you know.

389
00:34:34,517 --> 00:34:36,143
- Regular wage?
- Yeah.

390
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:39,689
Well, that's a start.
Did you tell them you were on parole?

391
00:34:39,855 --> 00:34:41,274
No. Is that a problem?

392
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,484
Oh, no worry.
I can take care of that.

393
00:34:43,651 --> 00:34:45,861
You've got a room,
you've got a job, the whole--

394
00:34:46,028 --> 00:34:49,282
You gave me a week, so yeah.
It's over in Verona.

395
00:34:51,617 --> 00:34:53,286
What's this?

396
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,789
- Just matches.
- I know that.

397
00:34:56,956 --> 00:34:58,624
Take off your shirt.
Let's see your arms.

398
00:34:58,791 --> 00:35:01,127
- They're not mine.
- Max, take off your shirt.

399
00:35:10,678 --> 00:35:12,054
What's this?

400
00:35:12,221 --> 00:35:16,058
That's just a scratch I got
on the job today. It's not tracks.

401
00:35:16,517 --> 00:35:18,644
- Let me see this one.
- You won't find nothing.

402
00:35:18,811 --> 00:35:20,730
Just let me do my work.

403
00:35:23,149 --> 00:35:26,819
- Where'd you get all those scars?
- It's just burns.

404
00:35:26,986 --> 00:35:29,405
- When you were a kid?
- Yeah, it was an accident.

405
00:35:29,572 --> 00:35:31,115
Does it hurt?

406
00:35:31,282 --> 00:35:33,284
Let me see the other one.

407
00:35:33,743 --> 00:35:37,580
Did you hear about the Polack
who got third-degree burns on his face?

408
00:35:38,372 --> 00:35:40,583
He was dunking for french fries.

409
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,501
Been drinking some beer, huh?

410
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,462
Yeah. Just a couple cans, though.

411
00:35:44,629 --> 00:35:46,923
- What are you doing?
- Come on, Max.

412
00:35:47,089 --> 00:35:49,342
Come on, Max. Come on, now.
Take it easy.

413
00:35:49,508 --> 00:35:51,719
Why'd you do that?
You didn't have to chain me.

414
00:35:51,886 --> 00:35:53,971
- It's procedure.
- I told you, I'm clean.

415
00:35:54,138 --> 00:35:55,431
Then you got nothing
to worry about.

416
00:35:55,598 --> 00:35:58,059
Just come over here and check me
if you got a doubt.

417
00:35:58,351 --> 00:36:00,478
- If you're clean--
- What do you mean, ''if''?

418
00:36:00,645 --> 00:36:03,022
You didn't check me properly.
Did you check my eyes?

419
00:36:03,231 --> 00:36:05,316
If you're clean,
you got nothing to worry about.

420
00:36:05,483 --> 00:36:08,444
I gotta make a phone call,
then we'll take you down and test you.

421
00:36:08,611 --> 00:36:12,698
- I could save you a lot of trouble.
- It's no trouble. It's what I get paid for.

422
00:36:21,082 --> 00:36:23,125
We're just playing a game.

423
00:36:35,054 --> 00:36:37,098
All right. Come on, follow me.

424
00:36:40,101 --> 00:36:41,978
Come on. Keep it up.

425
00:36:50,945 --> 00:36:52,655
All right, move right in here.

426
00:36:52,822 --> 00:36:57,535
- Gentlemen, follow the red line.
- Take your hat off.

427
00:37:00,788 --> 00:37:03,416
Right in the corner, facing me.
Take your hat off.

428
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,589
Starting with you, right over in this corner.
Facing me, gentlemen.

429
00:37:09,755 --> 00:37:12,008
Everybody facing me.

430
00:37:12,842 --> 00:37:16,345
In case you don't know where you are,
this is the Los Angeles County Jail.

431
00:37:16,512 --> 00:37:20,933
Welcome, and empty your pockets
on the floor. Everything out.

432
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:25,062
Cigarettes, money, matches, everything.
On the floor.

433
00:37:25,897 --> 00:37:29,400
Turn your pockets inside out
after you get everything out.

434
00:37:34,655 --> 00:37:38,242
Okay, gentlemen, I want you to run
your fingers through your hair.

435
00:37:39,118 --> 00:37:41,287
Shake it out good.

436
00:37:41,454 --> 00:37:43,080
Shake it out good.

437
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:46,876
- Is that a wig?
- Yeah, it's a wig.

438
00:37:47,043 --> 00:37:49,378
Take it off. Put it on the floor.

439
00:37:50,338 --> 00:37:52,465
Run your hands through your hair.

440
00:37:57,345 --> 00:38:01,265
Okay, gentlemen, put your hands
out in front of you, palms up.

441
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:05,770
Okay, turn over.

442
00:38:06,771 --> 00:38:10,483
Okay, gentlemen, turn around
and grab a piece of the wall.

443
00:38:10,691 --> 00:38:12,318
Step back. Spread your feet.

444
00:38:23,287 --> 00:38:26,749
As soon as you take your clothes off,
I want you to sit on a bench.

445
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:28,668
Okay, move on.

446
00:38:28,876 --> 00:38:31,170
Don't be afraid to use some soap.

447
00:38:32,213 --> 00:38:35,258
All right, gentlemen,
you people in the shower, let's move it out.

448
00:38:35,424 --> 00:38:39,011
We don't have all day.
That water's not free.

449
00:38:41,597 --> 00:38:43,558
Take your showers and get out.

450
00:38:43,724 --> 00:38:48,354
As soon as you step out of your shower,
grab a towel and step over on the side.

451
00:38:48,563 --> 00:38:51,190
Dry yourself off thoroughly.

452
00:38:52,525 --> 00:38:54,443
Let's go, gentlemen.

453
00:38:56,237 --> 00:38:57,863
Turn around.

454
00:38:59,532 --> 00:39:02,702
- Go. Let's go, arms up.
- If you were on a bench, get in the shower.

455
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:05,371
- Small, medium or large?
- Medium.

456
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:10,001
- Head down. Turn around. Go.
- Let's go, gentlemen.

457
00:39:10,167 --> 00:39:13,796
Get out of the shower and dry off.
We don't have enough time.

458
00:39:13,963 --> 00:39:16,507
- Let's go. Move it out.
- Good hands, Pop.

459
00:39:29,562 --> 00:39:31,772
That one's mine, partner.

460
00:39:52,376 --> 00:39:55,171
Stand clear!

461
00:40:48,349 --> 00:40:51,060
Dembo! Visit!

462
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,345
- Hi, remember me?
- Yeah. How you doing?

463
00:41:26,554 --> 00:41:29,849
- Pretty good. How are you?
- I'm fine.

464
00:41:30,308 --> 00:41:34,729
I called your hotel and your landlady told me
you were arrested. What happened?

465
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,815
I don't know.

466
00:41:38,733 --> 00:41:40,318
Doesn't matter.

467
00:41:41,611 --> 00:41:44,238
I got worried. I was waiting and....

468
00:41:45,364 --> 00:41:46,991
When are you getting out?

469
00:41:51,913 --> 00:41:54,373
I don't know.
It's a little hard to say.

470
00:41:57,376 --> 00:42:00,046
You don't mind my coming here, do you?

471
00:42:03,716 --> 00:42:07,887
I called earlier and they said
the visiting room closes at 3.

472
00:42:08,054 --> 00:42:10,431
I got lost on the way.

473
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:16,395
Is there anything I can do?

474
00:42:19,607 --> 00:42:22,610
- No, it's all right.
- What?

475
00:42:24,445 --> 00:42:28,324
Oh, God, there's no more time.
Wait a second.

476
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:35,831
- I gotta go.
- Wait. Wait.

477
00:42:37,792 --> 00:42:39,627
Call me when you get out.

478
00:42:39,794 --> 00:42:42,713
Call me. It's my home phone.

479
00:42:44,298 --> 00:42:46,050
Okay?

480
00:43:33,514 --> 00:43:37,685
This terrific-looking blond goes into this
dentist's office and she's really scared.

481
00:43:37,852 --> 00:43:41,731
So she climbs up into the chair as the
dentist is preparing his utensils and things.

482
00:43:41,898 --> 00:43:45,067
And just as he turns around
and is about to look into her mouth...

483
00:43:45,234 --> 00:43:48,321
...she blurts out,
''Oh, doctor, I'm so afraid of dentists...

484
00:43:48,529 --> 00:43:51,657
...why, I think I'd rather have a baby
than have a tooth drilled.''

485
00:43:51,824 --> 00:43:54,994
''Well, miss,'' the doctor says,
''you'd better make up your mind...

486
00:43:55,202 --> 00:43:57,705
...before I adjust the chair.''

487
00:44:03,127 --> 00:44:05,421
So how you doing?

488
00:44:07,131 --> 00:44:09,926
How do you think I'm doing,
slammed down?

489
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,803
What?

490
00:44:13,471 --> 00:44:15,181
I'm okay.

491
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:19,227
Listen, your urine tested clean.

492
00:44:20,186 --> 00:44:23,272
I'm sorry you got stuck here,
but I've had my hands full this week.

493
00:44:23,439 --> 00:44:26,943
- This is the first time I could reach you.
- Did the phones break down?

494
00:44:28,277 --> 00:44:31,197
Don't get sarcastic with me, Dembo.

495
00:44:31,739 --> 00:44:35,243
I'm having you released from here.
I'll take you to a halfway house myself.

496
00:44:35,409 --> 00:44:38,204
- When is that? Now?
- Right now.

497
00:44:38,412 --> 00:44:40,873
I think that's more than generous.

498
00:44:43,751 --> 00:44:44,961
You're the boss.

499
00:44:45,127 --> 00:44:48,089
Right. You're smart enough
to recognize a break when you get one.

500
00:44:48,256 --> 00:44:50,758
Now, you were clean,
but somebody fixed in your room.

501
00:44:50,925 --> 00:44:53,886
That's a violation of your parole
and it's enough to get you...

502
00:44:54,053 --> 00:44:56,055
...a minimum of two to three years.

503
00:44:56,264 --> 00:44:57,890
Am I right?

504
00:44:59,475 --> 00:45:01,894
- So we'll start from scratch.
- Sure.

505
00:45:02,103 --> 00:45:04,981
We'll get you cleaned up
and we'll get you out of here.

506
00:45:05,773 --> 00:45:08,401
- Okay.
- All right.

507
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:12,697
Sometimes this job
is getting to be too much.

508
00:45:12,905 --> 00:45:15,032
You wouldn't believe the week
I had last week.

509
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:18,411
I missed my girl's school play.
My wife was so pissed off at me...

510
00:45:18,619 --> 00:45:20,371
...I thought she was gonna divorce me.

511
00:45:20,538 --> 00:45:24,041
On top of that, I got a call that one
of my guys was holed up in his house.

512
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:27,420
Threatening his wife with a shotgun.
Guess how I handled that one.

513
00:45:27,628 --> 00:45:28,963
I used my head.

514
00:45:29,505 --> 00:45:31,507
I called his father in Detroit...

515
00:45:31,674 --> 00:45:35,303
...then I got them talking on the phone.
They must have talked for three hours.

516
00:45:35,469 --> 00:45:38,806
All this is person-to-person.
It's costing the state.

517
00:45:41,142 --> 00:45:45,771
<i>--in the top of the seventh inning, Dodgers
leading 1 0-2. Scored 1 0 each game.</i>

518
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:49,734
Damn it. You know, I had 1 0 bucks
on that game.

519
00:45:50,902 --> 00:45:52,403
Everything you got check out?

520
00:45:53,237 --> 00:45:55,448
- Yeah.
- Good.

521
00:45:55,615 --> 00:45:57,950
Cooking spoon's not there, is it?

522
00:45:59,118 --> 00:46:02,955
Come on. Just between you and me,
this doesn't go any further...

523
00:46:03,122 --> 00:46:04,957
...who was it shot up in your room?

524
00:46:07,335 --> 00:46:09,629
I just can't tell you that.

525
00:46:10,004 --> 00:46:13,758
I'm taking you to a halfway house.
I'm not taking you back to the joint.

526
00:46:13,925 --> 00:46:16,093
You asked for my trust.
I'm giving it to you.

527
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:19,597
- How about giving me a little back in return?
- I can't tell you that.

528
00:46:19,764 --> 00:46:23,809
That's bullshit. If you can't trust me,
what the hell, I'm just wasting gas driving.

529
00:46:24,018 --> 00:46:27,605
- I don't want you to waste your gas.
- Then tell me who it was.

530
00:46:35,112 --> 00:46:36,572
Christ, you're gonna kill us!

531
00:46:48,084 --> 00:46:50,503
Cut it out. Go on.

532
00:46:59,095 --> 00:47:01,847
Don't fuck with me, sucker.
You busted me for nothing!

533
00:47:02,014 --> 00:47:04,475
You big, bald fucker!

534
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:23,536
You're finished.
You made your choice.

535
00:47:35,381 --> 00:47:37,049
Max!

536
00:47:48,269 --> 00:47:53,649
- Damn you sons of bitches!
- Hey, fatso, where's your pants?

537
00:48:21,844 --> 00:48:24,764
- Hey, how you doing, man?
- Hey, my friend.

538
00:48:24,972 --> 00:48:27,266
- How you been?
- Haven't seen you in a while.

539
00:48:27,433 --> 00:48:29,018
I know, I got hung up for a while.

540
00:48:29,185 --> 00:48:31,604
- What you got going?
- I need your car.

541
00:48:31,771 --> 00:48:33,189
- The keys are in it.
- All right.

542
00:48:33,356 --> 00:48:36,567
- Hey, take me with you.
- I can't. I gotta see some people.

543
00:48:36,734 --> 00:48:38,194
Be back in a couple hours.

544
00:48:38,361 --> 00:48:41,113
- Next time, I wanna go with you.
- All right, you got it.

545
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,157
- I'm not shitting you.
- I hear you.

546
00:48:43,866 --> 00:48:46,911
- If I go with you, I can drive. I can get--
- You got it.

547
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,330
Hey, my radio.

548
00:48:49,497 --> 00:48:51,082
I'll be back, couple hours.

549
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:52,500
Where's he going?

550
00:48:52,667 --> 00:48:55,795
He's going to the store.
He'll be back in a minute.

551
00:49:42,842 --> 00:49:46,429
- How are you? What's to it, Manny?
- How you doing, man?

552
00:49:46,596 --> 00:49:48,931
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

553
00:49:49,098 --> 00:49:50,975
I wanna talk.

554
00:49:51,601 --> 00:49:54,145
- Yeah.
- I mean right now, okay?

555
00:49:56,439 --> 00:49:59,817
- If anybody asks for me, I'm not here.
- All right.

556
00:50:06,115 --> 00:50:09,160
- What do you wanna talk about?
- I just need your help.

557
00:50:09,577 --> 00:50:12,413
- What do you want, money?
- I want a pistol.

558
00:50:13,706 --> 00:50:15,458
No, I don't do that, Max.

559
00:50:15,625 --> 00:50:19,378
- You don't keep a piece in your office?
- I don't play around with guns.

560
00:50:20,922 --> 00:50:24,050
You owe me one, Manny.
You owe me one.

561
00:50:28,638 --> 00:50:30,514
Come on.

562
00:50:34,352 --> 00:50:35,978
Shut the door.

563
00:50:36,145 --> 00:50:39,357
- I got something we took off a drunk.
- Just give me what you have.

564
00:50:39,523 --> 00:50:42,443
I just gotta get my hands
on some heavy stuff, you know?

565
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:46,197
I need a Thompson, you know, a Magnum.

566
00:50:47,031 --> 00:50:49,158
Maybe a shotgun.
Can you raise that for me?

567
00:50:49,325 --> 00:50:51,285
- Takes a lot of cash, Max.
- What is this?

568
00:50:51,452 --> 00:50:53,746
It's a piece of shit.
We took it off a drunk.

569
00:50:53,955 --> 00:50:56,582
- Does it work?
- I don't know. I don't play with those.

570
00:50:56,791 --> 00:50:59,919
- Makes my dick hard.
- It's yours.

571
00:51:00,962 --> 00:51:03,089
You put up the money,
I'll take care of you.

572
00:51:03,297 --> 00:51:06,717
- I ain't got that kind of cash.
- You're doing a lot of business out there.

573
00:51:06,926 --> 00:51:08,469
How much time do you need?

574
00:51:08,636 --> 00:51:12,098
- Give me a couple of days.
- You got it.

575
00:51:12,807 --> 00:51:17,186
I read you, Manny. Try for it tonight.
I'll call your house in the morning.

576
00:51:19,855 --> 00:51:23,025
Give me one full day. Go that way.
Go the side way.

577
00:51:23,192 --> 00:51:25,111
One full day.

578
00:52:40,436 --> 00:52:42,271
Take it easy and you won't get hurt.

579
00:52:42,438 --> 00:52:44,190
Give me the money.

580
00:52:44,649 --> 00:52:46,442
Open the register.

581
00:52:49,779 --> 00:52:51,489
Open the register.

582
00:52:51,656 --> 00:52:52,865
Does he speak English?

583
00:52:53,074 --> 00:52:54,867
Better tell him to open the register.

584
00:53:00,957 --> 00:53:03,918
Open the fucking register
or I'll blow your fucking head off.

585
00:53:04,085 --> 00:53:06,754
- Open it. You feel that? You feel that?
- Yeah.

586
00:53:06,921 --> 00:53:08,256
Open it.

587
00:53:10,258 --> 00:53:12,552
Get down. Get down.

588
00:53:15,179 --> 00:53:16,639
Hold it.

589
00:53:26,023 --> 00:53:27,567
Hold it.

590
00:53:28,401 --> 00:53:29,902
Don't move.

591
00:53:35,074 --> 00:53:36,909
Don't come out.

592
00:54:53,527 --> 00:54:54,946
What are you thinking about?

593
00:54:56,781 --> 00:54:59,492
You know you're
breaking the law right now?

594
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:01,494
What do you mean?

595
00:55:01,911 --> 00:55:05,706
I mean, a cop could knock on that door,
put you in jail.

596
00:55:09,126 --> 00:55:11,379
Why would he do that?

597
00:55:11,879 --> 00:55:13,965
You're harboring a fugitive.

598
00:55:14,131 --> 00:55:17,843
I jumped my parole yesterday.
I'm on the run.

599
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:22,014
I'll take my chances.

600
00:55:25,101 --> 00:55:27,103
No, I don't want any.

601
00:55:32,024 --> 00:55:34,485
I'd like to take you out tonight...

602
00:55:34,694 --> 00:55:37,863
...but I got some business to do
with some people...

603
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:41,158
...so why don't you just let me
borrow your car for a while?

604
00:55:43,327 --> 00:55:45,037
Okay.

605
00:55:50,084 --> 00:55:51,669
Promise not to steal it?

606
00:55:57,550 --> 00:56:00,011
Gotta go to work in the morning.

607
00:56:30,124 --> 00:56:31,709
- Damn, you scared me.
- Hey, Max.

608
00:56:31,918 --> 00:56:33,127
Mickey. How you been?

609
00:56:33,294 --> 00:56:34,962
- All right. When did you raise?
- A couple days ago.

610
00:56:35,129 --> 00:56:38,674
- Where'd you get those threads?
- I bought them. Let's go sit down, friend.

611
00:56:38,841 --> 00:56:40,509
You're looking good.

612
00:56:40,676 --> 00:56:42,178
- Slick.
- Yeah.

613
00:56:42,345 --> 00:56:43,763
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

614
00:56:43,971 --> 00:56:45,681
Why don't you let us
have that seat...

615
00:56:45,848 --> 00:56:48,267
...so me and my friend
can talk some business?

616
00:56:48,809 --> 00:56:51,812
- So how have you been?
- How long have you been around?

617
00:56:51,979 --> 00:56:54,065
I don't know. A couple years.

618
00:56:54,273 --> 00:56:56,108
- Want a drink?
- Yeah.

619
00:56:56,275 --> 00:57:00,571
- Tommy.
- Double Jack Daniel's with a 7 back.

620
00:57:00,738 --> 00:57:03,991
- What do you want?
- I'll have one of these things right here.

621
00:57:04,533 --> 00:57:06,244
How you been?

622
00:57:08,287 --> 00:57:10,456
Ready to make a move.

623
00:57:10,831 --> 00:57:12,625
You got something
you wanna run by me?

624
00:57:12,792 --> 00:57:15,795
I got a sweet poker game in the Valley
you might be interested in.

625
00:57:16,003 --> 00:57:19,006
- Sounds good. What's it good for?
- Fifteen or 20 big ones.

626
00:57:19,173 --> 00:57:21,092
That much? Any guns?

627
00:57:21,259 --> 00:57:23,719
No, just some fat-ass old men, man.

628
00:57:23,886 --> 00:57:27,807
They all got pacemakers that'll short-circuit
when you charge through the door.

629
00:57:29,559 --> 00:57:31,519
All right, I'm interested.

630
00:57:31,686 --> 00:57:33,145
Can you help me with a partner?

631
00:57:33,604 --> 00:57:35,982
What about Kelly Mason?
He comes here all the time.

632
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:38,025
He'd jump at the chance
to work with you.

633
00:57:38,192 --> 00:57:39,777
Who's that kid that just got up?

634
00:57:39,944 --> 00:57:43,155
That's Augie Morales' brother.

635
00:57:43,364 --> 00:57:45,074
- Is that Augie's kid brother?
- Yeah.

636
00:57:45,241 --> 00:57:48,452
- Get him over here.
- Hey, Chungie. Come here.

637
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:51,747
- How you doing?
- Nice to see you again.

638
00:57:51,914 --> 00:57:55,042
This is Max Dembo, man.
He's a good friend of Augie's.

639
00:57:55,209 --> 00:57:57,003
- Hi.
- You don't remember me, do you?

640
00:57:57,211 --> 00:58:00,423
- Yes. You're a friend of my brother's, right?
- How's he doing?

641
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:03,801
He's not doing very well right now.
He's doing 20 years in Arizona...

642
00:58:03,968 --> 00:58:06,804
...and has a lot of problems
in California too.

643
00:58:06,971 --> 00:58:10,308
- Can you vouch for him?
- He's as good as Augie was at that age.

644
00:58:10,474 --> 00:58:12,143
Can I get ahold of him through you?

645
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:14,854
I got his phone number,
or you can catch him in here.

646
00:58:15,062 --> 00:58:17,690
I got something for you, maybe.
We'll talk later, okay?

647
00:58:17,899 --> 00:58:20,359
- Just give me a call.
- Give my love to your brother.

648
00:58:20,526 --> 00:58:23,863
- I will. Thank you very much. See you later.
- All right, take care.

649
00:58:24,071 --> 00:58:26,407
- Does he take shit?
- No, he's too smart for that.

650
00:58:26,574 --> 00:58:27,950
He's a good thief for his age.

651
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:30,119
Know what I'd like to do?

652
00:58:30,286 --> 00:58:33,456
Run me by that motel.
We'll check it out, then we can go cut it up.

653
00:58:34,707 --> 00:58:37,668
I'll drive you out there,
but I'm not gonna rob it for you.

654
00:58:37,877 --> 00:58:41,547
You've got to do that yourself,
you know. I got stomach trouble.

655
00:58:41,714 --> 00:58:43,549
No guts.

656
00:59:15,331 --> 00:59:17,083
Did I scare you?

657
00:59:18,292 --> 00:59:19,752
Yeah, a little bit.

658
00:59:41,148 --> 00:59:43,442
You gotta go to work pretty soon.

659
00:59:50,449 --> 00:59:52,410
What time is it?

660
01:01:40,142 --> 01:01:42,395
Wanna take a shower with me?

661
01:01:45,982 --> 01:01:47,650
Can I use your phone?

662
01:01:47,817 --> 01:01:49,652
Yeah, go ahead.

663
01:02:01,247 --> 01:02:03,499
Is Jerry Schue there?

664
01:02:03,791 --> 01:02:06,878
- Looks like you're fixed up pretty good.
- Yeah, it's going all right.

665
01:02:07,086 --> 01:02:09,589
After you fell,
I pulled a few jobs and met Carol.

666
01:02:09,797 --> 01:02:11,007
She straightened me out...

667
01:02:11,173 --> 01:02:14,927
...so I set myself up in the
painting/contracting business. Sit here.

668
01:02:15,428 --> 01:02:17,305
We bought the house.

669
01:02:17,471 --> 01:02:22,476
I got that boat. Put that pool in last year.
The only thing I need's a new car.

670
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:26,647
That one out front belonged to Carol's ex.
It's about had it.

671
01:02:26,814 --> 01:02:29,942
When you were at Quentin,
did you know a guy named Don Shaffer?

672
01:02:30,151 --> 01:02:32,236
- I don't think so.
- Kind of a short, squat guy.

673
01:02:32,445 --> 01:02:34,989
- He was my first husband.
- He don't know the man, honey.

674
01:02:35,156 --> 01:02:38,534
- So you got a place in town, Max, or what?
- Nickname ''Lumpy.''

675
01:02:38,701 --> 01:02:40,661
I know him.
Was that your first husband?

676
01:02:40,828 --> 01:02:42,121
Yeah, I know Lumpy.

677
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:45,124
What are we gonna do, honey,
go down the whole damn list?

678
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:48,044
First there was Lumpy,
then it was Steve the bodybuilder...

679
01:02:48,211 --> 01:02:49,921
...greased himself to death...

680
01:02:50,087 --> 01:02:53,090
...then Raymond,
who sold us the lemon out front.

681
01:02:53,466 --> 01:02:56,802
- Did I leave any out?
- Oh, will you cut it out?

682
01:02:56,969 --> 01:02:59,847
So how'd you two lovebirds meet?

683
01:03:00,806 --> 01:03:03,142
I met her at a 31 Flavors, of all places.

684
01:03:03,351 --> 01:03:05,603
Yeah, he was 32.

685
01:03:05,770 --> 01:03:07,855
Isn't she a peach?

686
01:03:08,189 --> 01:03:11,484
Why don't we get Sherry
and we could all go out dancing later?

687
01:03:11,651 --> 01:03:14,445
Oh, you mean Sherry,
that blond that threw up in the car...

688
01:03:14,612 --> 01:03:15,988
...the last time we went out?

689
01:03:16,197 --> 01:03:19,533
I know the kind of broad he wants.
A good-looking broad. Marlene.

690
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:23,037
- I'd really like a beer, if you have one.
- Sure, I got beer.

691
01:03:23,204 --> 01:03:25,373
- Do you want everything on these burgers?
- Yeah.

692
01:03:25,539 --> 01:03:26,916
Okay. Here.

693
01:03:28,876 --> 01:03:30,586
Thanks.

694
01:03:31,045 --> 01:03:32,505
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

695
01:03:32,713 --> 01:03:34,340
Thank you, honey.

696
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:42,848
Not bad.

697
01:03:43,891 --> 01:03:45,851
Get me out of here.

698
01:03:47,228 --> 01:03:49,730
They're killing me.
I can't make this scene any more.

699
01:03:49,897 --> 01:03:51,524
Get me out of here.

700
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:55,611
You got something.
I know you got something.

701
01:03:55,778 --> 01:03:57,530
Yeah, I got something.

702
01:03:57,738 --> 01:03:59,532
Well, let's do it.

703
01:04:00,157 --> 01:04:04,412
- Don't you wanna know what it is?
- I don't give a damn. Let's just do it.

704
01:04:05,329 --> 01:04:06,831
What is it?

705
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:10,877
A bunch of old guys play poker
over in a motel in the Valley.

706
01:04:11,043 --> 01:04:12,879
They got about $20,000 on the table.

707
01:04:13,087 --> 01:04:15,464
We just tiptoe in,
tiptoe out, and it's all ours.

708
01:04:15,631 --> 01:04:17,633
There ain't no cops
because they can't call.

709
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,844
- Great. You got the guns?
- Yeah.

710
01:04:20,011 --> 01:04:22,763
- We need a shotgun.
- Here, honey.

711
01:04:23,598 --> 01:04:25,683
I don't know what to play.

712
01:04:25,892 --> 01:04:28,728
- You still playing that thing?
- I'm eating, for chrissake.

713
01:04:28,895 --> 01:04:30,688
You can play later, but I'd prefer now.

714
01:04:30,855 --> 01:04:32,523
Play that song where you yodel.

715
01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:35,192
What's that ''Walking Stick'' thing
you used to play?

716
01:04:35,484 --> 01:04:38,696
What ''Walking Stick''? You mean
''Hand Me Down My Walking Cane''?

717
01:04:38,863 --> 01:04:41,032
''Walking Cane,'' yeah, play that.

718
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,618
Come on, we got cause to celebrate.

719
01:04:48,164 --> 01:04:49,832
AIrighty.

720
01:06:20,006 --> 01:06:22,633
Oh, shit, Max.

721
01:06:22,842 --> 01:06:27,054
All right, Jerry. Take it easy.
We're all right. He'll be here.

722
01:06:29,473 --> 01:06:31,601
Man, this is very unprofessional.

723
01:06:31,809 --> 01:06:34,770
All I'm saying is you give the man
1 0 minutes.

724
01:06:35,021 --> 01:06:36,606
He'll be here. It's all right.

725
01:06:36,814 --> 01:06:40,443
It's not all right, man. I've had it.
Get me out of here.

726
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:47,491
Is that him?

727
01:06:48,993 --> 01:06:50,536
Is that him?

728
01:06:54,081 --> 01:06:56,918
No. If it was him,
he would have stopped.

729
01:07:01,881 --> 01:07:04,217
That's it. They're coming out.
It's over. Let's go.

730
01:07:04,383 --> 01:07:06,510
We're still all right.
We still can do it, man.

731
01:07:06,677 --> 01:07:09,639
It's over, man. Look at the people.
They're coming out, man.

732
01:07:09,805 --> 01:07:13,476
I mean, I don't care if he shows up
with a 20 mm cannon. It's over.

733
01:07:13,976 --> 01:07:15,519
Fuck it.

734
01:07:16,854 --> 01:07:20,983
Jesus. Will you wait a minute, man?
They'll see you.

735
01:07:21,859 --> 01:07:24,862
We're all right. There's five
more guys in there. Let's do it.

736
01:07:25,029 --> 01:07:27,865
I told you, I'm not taking that game
without a shotgun.

737
01:07:28,032 --> 01:07:31,035
You can't cover a fucking poker game
without a shotgun, all right?

738
01:07:31,202 --> 01:07:34,038
The plan was to meet your friend here
with a shotgun...

739
01:07:34,205 --> 01:07:36,541
...we go in and do the job
and we leave, all right?

740
01:07:36,707 --> 01:07:40,419
Now, we've been sitting here all night
waiting for the guy with the shotgun...

741
01:07:40,586 --> 01:07:42,672
...and you wanna take it
with your cap pistol...

742
01:07:42,838 --> 01:07:47,009
...and I'm telling you
it's very un-fucking-professional, all right?

743
01:07:53,391 --> 01:07:56,978
- That's him.
- If that's him, tell him he's late.

744
01:08:07,405 --> 01:08:10,032
- How you doing?
- What's to it, Manny?

745
01:08:10,241 --> 01:08:14,036
Some really fucking weird shit.
You know the bartender, the asshole--

746
01:08:14,203 --> 01:08:16,080
What do you got for me?

747
01:08:16,289 --> 01:08:17,540
Go ahead.

748
01:08:17,707 --> 01:08:19,959
I was just gonna--
I didn't come with nothing...

749
01:08:20,126 --> 01:08:23,713
...because the bartender, I gave him
the key to my place to lock up--

750
01:08:23,921 --> 01:08:25,256
So, what'd you bring me?

751
01:08:25,423 --> 01:08:29,260
- I didn't bring you nothing. But I--
- Well, just tell me, why weren't you here?

752
01:08:29,427 --> 01:08:31,888
- Well, will you let me explain, Max?
- Yeah, go ahead.

753
01:08:36,475 --> 01:08:38,769
There's people up there.
They're gonna see you.

754
01:08:38,936 --> 01:08:40,730
- Are you out of your mind?
- Sorry.

755
01:08:40,897 --> 01:08:43,649
Come on, man. Calm down.
You made your point.

756
01:08:43,816 --> 01:08:46,861
You were righteous, okay?
Cool it, man. Just cool it.

757
01:08:47,028 --> 01:08:50,072
We fucked the score off on--
Hey, hey!

758
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:52,992
We fucked the score off
on account of you, you know that?

759
01:08:53,159 --> 01:08:56,954
Will you just settle down?
Get in the car. Please.

760
01:08:57,121 --> 01:08:59,957
You know, I counted on him.
He let me down. He was wrong.

761
01:09:00,124 --> 01:09:02,585
- So get in the car.
- He was wrong. He let me down.

762
01:09:03,211 --> 01:09:07,715
Hey, get in the car.
This ain't gonna make it, man. Okay?

763
01:09:07,882 --> 01:09:10,092
You're wrong, Manny. You know that?

764
01:09:10,259 --> 01:09:14,722
- You know that you're wrong, right?
- Come on, man. There's no money in this.

765
01:09:19,018 --> 01:09:20,895
How's it feel
getting fucked out of 20 grand?

766
01:09:21,062 --> 01:09:23,314
It ain't no big thing.
I just wanna get you home.

767
01:09:23,481 --> 01:09:24,732
Let's go. It's cold.

768
01:09:24,899 --> 01:09:27,151
- I've gotta cool this dude down.
- He won't tell.

769
01:09:27,318 --> 01:09:30,488
I'm gonna make sure so I can keep you
on the streets. Turn the key.

770
01:09:30,655 --> 01:09:32,990
- I'm all right.
- You going home?

771
01:09:33,157 --> 01:09:35,993
Tell me the truth. You going home?
You know what you're doing?

772
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:39,622
- I won't let you down next time.
- Turn your lights on.

773
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:23,351
Come on, baby.

774
01:11:37,949 --> 01:11:39,825
Shit.

775
01:11:40,117 --> 01:11:41,827
Fucker.

776
01:14:03,427 --> 01:14:04,887
Hi.

777
01:14:20,903 --> 01:14:22,572
What happened? Where've you been?

778
01:14:23,781 --> 01:14:25,491
I had to take care of some business.

779
01:14:25,658 --> 01:14:28,578
What kind of business?
Why are you all dirty?

780
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:31,289
I broke through a wall.

781
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:33,916
Why?

782
01:14:34,834 --> 01:14:36,586
I did something.

783
01:14:38,671 --> 01:14:40,798
The place looks nice.

784
01:14:41,507 --> 01:14:43,217
All right.

785
01:14:43,509 --> 01:14:47,722
What made you finally decide to unpack?

786
01:14:51,934 --> 01:14:54,228
How far you wanna take this?

787
01:15:00,151 --> 01:15:01,819
I don't know.

788
01:15:02,486 --> 01:15:05,489
I thought we were working
on something here, but maybe I'm wrong.

789
01:15:06,282 --> 01:15:08,242
No. What do you think
I've been doing?

790
01:15:08,409 --> 01:15:10,828
Guess I never really thought about it.

791
01:15:12,205 --> 01:15:15,666
Want me to lie and say I work
on a hot-dog stand? I can't do a regular job.

792
01:15:15,833 --> 01:15:17,210
I'm not gonna take your money.

793
01:15:17,752 --> 01:15:20,296
Well, do you have
an alternative for me?

794
01:15:20,963 --> 01:15:22,298
I'm doing what I do.

795
01:15:22,465 --> 01:15:25,092
If you can't take it
and it's too heavy for you...

796
01:15:25,259 --> 01:15:27,470
...well, then I'll just walk out the door.

797
01:15:28,137 --> 01:15:30,681
I'll walk, but I don't want to.

798
01:15:31,057 --> 01:15:33,142
Was this just a one-time thing, or what?

799
01:15:33,851 --> 01:15:35,311
That depends on how lucky I get.

800
01:15:35,478 --> 01:15:38,272
The thing I had going got screwed up,
so I did another thing.

801
01:15:38,439 --> 01:15:41,150
I'm just trying to get myself together,
you know?

802
01:15:42,693 --> 01:15:45,821
If I could just get a decent score,
just put one thing together...

803
01:15:45,988 --> 01:15:50,076
...then we can kick back and maybe
we can get out of here. That's all.

804
01:15:51,702 --> 01:15:54,830
So I guess what we're really saying here
is if I can handle it.

805
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:57,959
- That's right.
- I don't want you to go.

806
01:15:58,125 --> 01:15:59,544
And I don't want to either.

807
01:16:00,711 --> 01:16:04,840
It's just that this is so totally out of
my experience. You gotta understand.

808
01:16:05,049 --> 01:16:08,970
I'll promise you that I won't hurt you,
and whatever I do doesn't involve you.

809
01:16:09,136 --> 01:16:10,846
I keep it outside.

810
01:16:11,013 --> 01:16:13,558
But maybe it'd be better
if you didn't ask me questions.

811
01:16:14,725 --> 01:16:19,313
I'll stay with you as long as I can handle it,
but when I can't, I'm gonna go.

812
01:16:20,106 --> 01:16:21,732
I know that.

813
01:16:25,403 --> 01:16:27,405
Just be careful.

814
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:32,201
I want you to know that
what you're doing out there...

815
01:16:32,368 --> 01:16:34,453
...it scares the shit out of me.

816
01:16:35,329 --> 01:16:37,206
It scares me too.

817
01:16:37,415 --> 01:16:38,875
Come here.

818
01:16:40,418 --> 01:16:42,628
You come here.

819
01:16:56,434 --> 01:17:00,062
- Can I give you something?
- What is it?

820
01:17:00,938 --> 01:17:04,525
Something I found.

821
01:17:11,073 --> 01:17:13,951
Come on, now. Don't be scared.

822
01:17:18,122 --> 01:17:19,415
Don't be scared.

823
01:17:19,582 --> 01:17:21,500
I can't help it.

824
01:18:39,662 --> 01:18:42,331
Excuse me, sir,
would you look right over there, please?

825
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:44,500
All right, don't move.
Get up out of there.

826
01:18:44,667 --> 01:18:46,878
Get the fuck out of there, man.

827
01:18:49,797 --> 01:18:51,215
Get in there.

828
01:18:55,928 --> 01:19:00,182
All right, listen to me! This is a robbery!
Everybody on the floor.

829
01:19:00,349 --> 01:19:03,144
- Get down on the goddamn floor!
- Open the drawer.

830
01:19:03,436 --> 01:19:07,773
All the way down.
All you tellers, down on the floor.

831
01:19:08,107 --> 01:19:12,069
All the way down! Hey, get down!

832
01:19:12,236 --> 01:19:13,529
Open the drawer. Open it up.

833
01:19:13,696 --> 01:19:15,698
Get down before I start killing people!

834
01:19:15,865 --> 01:19:18,367
Get your drawer open, honey.
Get your drawer open.

835
01:19:18,534 --> 01:19:20,369
Stop looking at me!

836
01:19:23,414 --> 01:19:25,458
Get down on the goddamn floor!

837
01:19:27,168 --> 01:19:29,003
Thirty seconds.

838
01:19:40,181 --> 01:19:42,099
Twenty seconds.

839
01:19:50,066 --> 01:19:53,402
You in love with me?
Answer me! Are you in love with me?

840
01:19:53,861 --> 01:19:58,282
Then stop looking at me, motherfucker,
or I'll blow your goddamn face off!

841
01:19:59,867 --> 01:20:02,078
Time's up. Let's go.

842
01:20:07,875 --> 01:20:09,544
Let's go.

843
01:20:13,172 --> 01:20:15,258
Let's go!

844
01:20:17,468 --> 01:20:18,678
Let's hit it.

845
01:20:19,095 --> 01:20:21,180
Let's go!

846
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:25,184
Get back!

847
01:20:25,351 --> 01:20:29,021
Get back. Get down on the floor!

848
01:20:35,611 --> 01:20:37,530
Let's go.

849
01:20:49,667 --> 01:20:51,419
- How much did we get?
- We got a bunch.

850
01:20:51,586 --> 01:20:54,589
- How was I? Was I good?
- You scared the shit out of me.

851
01:21:41,177 --> 01:21:45,348
Hit it, hit it. Just hit it.
Hit it. Let's go.

852
01:21:48,935 --> 01:21:50,895
Make a left here.

853
01:21:59,570 --> 01:22:02,657
- What do we got?
- I don't know. I can't tell yet. It's fat.

854
01:22:02,823 --> 01:22:07,161
- What is it? Twenties, 30s, 50s?
- Yeah, there's 20s. There's no 30s, man.

855
01:22:07,328 --> 01:22:09,747
- Any ones?
- Yeah, there's a few ones.

856
01:22:09,914 --> 01:22:13,292
- A couple hundreds.
- What would you say, 20, 30,000? Forty?

857
01:22:13,459 --> 01:22:17,129
What's that look like?
What's that look like to you, huh?

858
01:22:17,296 --> 01:22:20,049
- What's this look like, huh?
- Let me feel it.

859
01:22:20,299 --> 01:22:23,261
Come on. Asshole.

860
01:22:23,427 --> 01:22:26,055
Put it up your fucking snoot, baby.

861
01:22:26,264 --> 01:22:28,099
- Man.
- We got more fucking money here....

862
01:22:28,266 --> 01:22:30,268
Let's go over to your place
and cut it up.

863
01:22:30,434 --> 01:22:34,438
- Put it in the bathroom, lock the door--
- Right on the floor.

864
01:22:34,981 --> 01:22:37,817
From now on, when I say go, though, man,
we gotta go, man.

865
01:22:37,984 --> 01:22:39,944
- When I yell, ''Go,'' go.
- The clock--

866
01:22:40,111 --> 01:22:42,405
The clock, my ass.
We always go through this shit.

867
01:22:42,572 --> 01:22:45,950
I'll dock you 8 grand you stopped me
from getting from that last teller.

868
01:22:46,117 --> 01:22:47,702
Eight thousand fucking dollars.

869
01:22:47,869 --> 01:22:50,913
It was like pulling teeth
to get you out of the fucking place.

870
01:22:51,122 --> 01:22:52,790
So we scored.

871
01:22:55,418 --> 01:22:58,588
- Do you like it?
- Not really. What are we doing here?

872
01:22:58,754 --> 01:23:01,215
Let me buy you something.
What about the earrings?

873
01:23:01,382 --> 01:23:03,426
- I think it's a set.
- Look at the ring.

874
01:23:03,634 --> 01:23:05,887
The price tag on it's $91 35.

875
01:23:06,053 --> 01:23:09,307
- I bet that bracelet's worth more than--
- Hello. May I help you?

876
01:23:10,975 --> 01:23:14,270
- How much is that?
- Eighteen thousand.

877
01:23:21,736 --> 01:23:24,780
- What about this one here?
- Forty-seven five for the set.

878
01:23:24,989 --> 01:23:27,700
- With tax or without?
- Without tax.

879
01:23:27,867 --> 01:23:29,619
Want a watch?
Where's ladies' watches?

880
01:23:29,785 --> 01:23:31,871
This counter right over here.

881
01:23:32,496 --> 01:23:33,497
What are you doing?

882
01:23:33,664 --> 01:23:35,875
- I'm getting you a watch.
- I don't want a watch.

883
01:23:36,042 --> 01:23:37,627
- Hi.
- Hi. May I show you something?

884
01:23:37,835 --> 01:23:39,879
- Can we see some ladies' watches?
- Certainly.

885
01:23:40,046 --> 01:23:43,174
- This entire counter, all ladies' watches.
- How about your best one?

886
01:23:43,341 --> 01:23:46,135
Best one? Is right here.

887
01:23:47,470 --> 01:23:49,639
- That's all right.
- Isn't that a lovely watch?

888
01:23:49,847 --> 01:23:52,058
It's disgusting.

889
01:23:52,433 --> 01:23:54,310
- Let's see this one here.
- Certainly.

890
01:23:54,477 --> 01:23:56,854
- I don't like those diamonds.
- Let me put this back.

891
01:24:00,149 --> 01:24:01,817
That's nice.

892
01:24:03,361 --> 01:24:05,446
- How much is that?
- That's $2000.

893
01:24:05,613 --> 01:24:07,323
I can't wear that to work.

894
01:24:07,490 --> 01:24:11,118
You'd better show us something
less expensive. She has very simple tastes.

895
01:24:11,285 --> 01:24:13,162
It's my upbringing.
What can I tell you?

896
01:24:13,329 --> 01:24:15,373
Here, let's try this one.

897
01:24:15,831 --> 01:24:18,209
- How much is that one?
- This one is $900.

898
01:24:18,376 --> 01:24:21,546
That's pretty. What make is that?

899
01:24:22,672 --> 01:24:25,258
Sir? Excuse me.

900
01:24:26,008 --> 01:24:27,677
Where are you going?

901
01:24:28,427 --> 01:24:30,263
I was just looking for your restroom.

902
01:24:30,429 --> 01:24:34,183
I'm sorry, but we don't have
a public restroom here.

903
01:24:34,350 --> 01:24:38,020
There's a coffee shop two doors down.
They'll allow you to use their facilities.

904
01:24:38,229 --> 01:24:40,273
Thanks. Did you get what you wanted?

905
01:24:40,439 --> 01:24:43,150
- I like this the best.
- We'll have to think about it.

906
01:24:43,317 --> 01:24:45,361
- Very well.
- We'll be back.

907
01:24:45,570 --> 01:24:47,697
- Thank you for coming in.
- Bye-bye.

908
01:24:47,905 --> 01:24:49,907
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye.

909
01:24:50,366 --> 01:24:53,953
- Is there anything else to see upstairs?
- No, those are the executive offices.

910
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:55,371
All right.

911
01:24:57,915 --> 01:25:00,877
Look, this is Wilshire Boulevard
right here, right?

912
01:25:01,127 --> 01:25:02,879
All right. Here's the doors.

913
01:25:03,045 --> 01:25:06,549
Now, there's glass windows on either side,
and they're tinted, Jerry.

914
01:25:06,757 --> 01:25:08,551
From the outside, you cannot see in.

915
01:25:08,718 --> 01:25:10,887
But inside, you can see
all the action outside.

916
01:25:11,137 --> 01:25:13,598
We didn't have that on the bank, right?

917
01:25:14,140 --> 01:25:16,893
When I was in there,
the lady showed me one case.

918
01:25:17,101 --> 01:25:20,396
In one case, there was over
1 25 grand of ice there.

919
01:25:20,605 --> 01:25:22,440
In one case?

920
01:25:23,232 --> 01:25:24,901
What do you think?

921
01:25:25,401 --> 01:25:27,320
I don't know.

922
01:25:28,613 --> 01:25:32,408
Beverly Hills is rough, man.
It scares the shit out of me, Beverly Hills.

923
01:25:32,575 --> 01:25:33,534
Why's that?

924
01:25:33,743 --> 01:25:36,204
I don't know.
Well, how many cops they got there?

925
01:25:36,370 --> 01:25:39,040
They got 1 00 cops
in six square miles, you know.

926
01:25:39,207 --> 01:25:44,754
That's, you know, 20 cops
to the square mile, or whatever it is.

927
01:25:44,921 --> 01:25:46,797
What's the response time?
Three minutes?

928
01:25:46,964 --> 01:25:49,800
- Three minutes?
- What'd make you feel safe in there?

929
01:25:49,967 --> 01:25:53,054
Fuck Beverly Hills.
Fuck those cops, man. They're just cops.

930
01:25:53,221 --> 01:25:57,141
They can't be faster than three minutes.
The alarm goes off when we start sacking.

931
01:25:57,642 --> 01:25:59,310
Let the alarm go.

932
01:25:59,477 --> 01:26:02,104
Would you feel safe
for a minute and a half?

933
01:26:03,147 --> 01:26:06,943
Bob. I gotta get out of here, man.

934
01:26:07,109 --> 01:26:08,778
They're waiting on me.

935
01:26:08,986 --> 01:26:13,324
Hey, tell the old lady that owns the house
to sign this, not her mother, all right?

936
01:26:13,491 --> 01:26:15,535
- All right.
- Right up.

937
01:26:15,701 --> 01:26:18,704
You know next week
you don't have to do that?

938
01:26:19,038 --> 01:26:22,083
- I wanna see you with nice clothes.
- How much longer you gonna be?

939
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:24,752
- Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.
- Okay.

940
01:26:24,919 --> 01:26:28,130
Don't you wanna tan your face?
You wanna live in that neighborhood?

941
01:26:28,297 --> 01:26:29,549
Don't you want a new car?

942
01:26:29,715 --> 01:26:31,676
You're a thief.
Why don't you be a thief?

943
01:26:35,012 --> 01:26:37,056
Did you like doing that bank?

944
01:26:38,182 --> 01:26:41,143
Did you feel good doing that bank,
holding that shotgun?

945
01:26:41,477 --> 01:26:44,438
- Did you feel good working with me?
- Yeah.

946
01:26:44,605 --> 01:26:46,399
You wanna do it?

947
01:26:47,024 --> 01:26:50,444
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

948
01:26:52,029 --> 01:26:54,991
Yeah. What about a driver?

949
01:27:01,998 --> 01:27:04,500
Mickey Barber, the other night,
introduced me to a guy.

950
01:27:04,709 --> 01:27:06,419
I knew his brother.

951
01:27:08,045 --> 01:27:10,381
He said he's a good wheelman.

952
01:27:23,436 --> 01:27:25,396
- How you doing?
- Good.

953
01:27:25,897 --> 01:27:29,358
- Jerry, Willy.
- Hey, man, I've heard a lot about you.

954
01:27:29,650 --> 01:27:32,445
Here. I'll get it for you.

955
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:36,157
Watch your feet.

956
01:27:36,324 --> 01:27:37,533
- Who is that guy?
- What?

957
01:27:37,742 --> 01:27:39,243
- Is that the guy Mickey sent?
- No.

958
01:27:39,410 --> 01:27:40,661
- No?
- It fell through.

959
01:27:40,828 --> 01:27:43,706
- What do you mean?
- Did you get the plates of the car changed?

960
01:27:43,873 --> 01:27:47,376
The car is one half-hour hot and
the plates are changed. I did everything.

961
01:27:47,585 --> 01:27:50,922
You should have told me. That was wrong.
Do you hear me? That was wrong.

962
01:27:51,088 --> 01:27:54,800
- Where are we going?
- Just keep going. We'll talk about it later.

963
01:28:03,267 --> 01:28:05,978
- Right here?
- Go straight toward it.

964
01:28:06,145 --> 01:28:09,482
All right. Now, you're gonna back in
that first spot there.

965
01:28:10,608 --> 01:28:13,110
Go ahead. Take it easy.

966
01:28:17,907 --> 01:28:20,618
Soon as you get in,
I'll tell you what we're doing.

967
01:28:22,453 --> 01:28:24,789
- Oh, shit, I'm sorry.
- Take it easy, all right?

968
01:28:24,956 --> 01:28:28,417
Okay, you see that door over there?
We'll be out in a few minutes.

969
01:28:28,584 --> 01:28:31,837
As soon as we're out, open both doors.
We get in and split. You got it?

970
01:28:32,004 --> 01:28:33,339
- Yeah.
- How do you feel?

971
01:28:33,506 --> 01:28:35,550
- Do I keep the car running?
- Yeah. All right?

972
01:28:35,716 --> 01:28:37,134
- I'm okay.
- You ready to hit it?

973
01:28:37,301 --> 01:28:39,220
- Yeah.
- All right, let's go.

974
01:28:41,931 --> 01:28:43,933
Just relax, man.

975
01:28:49,772 --> 01:28:51,190
How do you feel?

976
01:28:51,357 --> 01:28:53,442
Feel great. Except for that driver, man.

977
01:28:53,651 --> 01:28:55,486
Don't worry about it.

978
01:28:55,861 --> 01:28:59,448
- You should have told me about it.
- All right, let's do this.

979
01:29:00,366 --> 01:29:02,285
- How's the vibes?
- Everything's all right.

980
01:29:02,451 --> 01:29:06,122
- A lot of traffic, a lot of people.
- I'd kiss you, but you're too ugly.

981
01:29:14,672 --> 01:29:16,841
No, it's too yellow. Thank you.

982
01:29:17,592 --> 01:29:20,761
Well, may I see the 1 0 mm, please?

983
01:29:20,928 --> 01:29:22,471
Yes.

984
01:29:25,683 --> 01:29:28,853
Well, yes, I like the pink....

985
01:29:30,146 --> 01:29:35,026
- I need a 24-carat ring.
- Well, we can order that. No problem.

986
01:29:36,861 --> 01:29:37,862
What about--?

987
01:29:38,029 --> 01:29:39,739
Pardon me. What are you doing?

988
01:29:39,906 --> 01:29:42,241
Can you step back, please?

989
01:29:47,622 --> 01:29:49,832
Do what you're told
and you won't get hurt.

990
01:29:50,041 --> 01:29:52,043
Get up against the wall! Face the wall!

991
01:30:16,734 --> 01:30:19,695
Sorry, sir. Will you step back in there
before you get shot?

992
01:30:21,864 --> 01:30:23,699
- How do you feel?
- Go ahead, get some.

993
01:30:23,866 --> 01:30:26,327
- We've got a minute and a half.
- Go on, there.

994
01:30:43,094 --> 01:30:44,887
What's the time?

995
01:30:45,763 --> 01:30:48,391
- What's the time?
- One minute.

996
01:30:55,982 --> 01:30:57,233
Get it all.

997
01:31:08,786 --> 01:31:10,913
Twenty seconds to go.

998
01:31:28,806 --> 01:31:30,057
Let's go.

999
01:31:31,392 --> 01:31:35,146
- Let's go! Let's hit it.
- We've got time.

1000
01:31:35,313 --> 01:31:37,815
Time's up! Let's go!

1001
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:43,863
Hey. Hey, let's go, man.

1002
01:31:44,447 --> 01:31:46,949
Let's go, man.
We've gotta get out of here.

1003
01:31:47,491 --> 01:31:48,993
There was another piece here.

1004
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:52,163
I don't believe this, man.
I really don't believe this.

1005
01:31:52,455 --> 01:31:55,041
- There's gonna be an army out there, man.
- Where was it?

1006
01:31:55,208 --> 01:31:57,210
- I don't know.
- There was a big piece here.

1007
01:32:01,172 --> 01:32:03,966
This is the last goddamn time, man.
This is it.

1008
01:32:04,175 --> 01:32:07,428
The poker game was the same way,
the driver, the whole goddamn thing.

1009
01:32:07,595 --> 01:32:11,515
This is it. It's all over.

1010
01:32:11,849 --> 01:32:15,978
You're a child, man. You act like
a 2-year-old child, for chrissake.

1011
01:32:16,854 --> 01:32:18,272
I know you like a book.

1012
01:32:18,439 --> 01:32:21,734
This is the last goddamn time
I'm working with you. I mean it.

1013
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:25,321
What are you--? Get over there
and sit down! Put your head down.

1014
01:32:25,488 --> 01:32:27,281
- What are you doing?
- Where's the watch?

1015
01:32:27,448 --> 01:32:29,492
Hey, we gotta get out of here, man!

1016
01:32:33,371 --> 01:32:34,997
Hey! Hey!

1017
01:32:35,164 --> 01:32:38,709
- Listen to me! Listen to me.
- Let go of that. All right, all right!

1018
01:32:38,876 --> 01:32:41,003
Give it to me, man.

1019
01:32:41,921 --> 01:32:45,258
- We're going.
- Why don't you take a clock too?

1020
01:32:45,424 --> 01:32:48,511
This is the last goddamn time
I'm working with you.

1021
01:32:54,392 --> 01:32:56,936
- Where is he?
- Yeah, where is he?

1022
01:32:57,395 --> 01:33:01,315
Where is he?
Was this part of your goddamn plan?

1023
01:33:05,278 --> 01:33:07,572
Who the fuck knows where he is?

1024
01:33:08,739 --> 01:33:11,117
You're pathetic.
You're a pathetic fucking human being.

1025
01:33:11,284 --> 01:33:13,911
We gotta run. We gotta run.
We gotta run.

1026
01:33:15,413 --> 01:33:17,456
Get rid of the shotgun!

1027
01:33:27,425 --> 01:33:31,554
Walk, walk, walk.
Slow down and walk. Walk.

1028
01:33:32,346 --> 01:33:34,932
- Come on.
- Are we going the right way?

1029
01:33:35,391 --> 01:33:37,935
The car's on the next street.
Come on, we're all right.

1030
01:33:58,623 --> 01:34:00,416
Halt! Police!

1031
01:37:19,991 --> 01:37:23,327
- It's a great line.
- We gotta go. Right now. Come on.

1032
01:37:28,249 --> 01:37:30,418
Excuse me, could you
see this guy for me?

1033
01:37:30,585 --> 01:37:32,587
- Where's your car?
- In the back.

1034
01:37:32,753 --> 01:37:34,338
- Where? Let's go.
- In the back.

1035
01:37:34,505 --> 01:37:38,092
So I'll be back in a second.
What's the matter?

1036
01:37:44,807 --> 01:37:48,811
- Where's your key? Where's your car?
- Keep going. It's over there.

1037
01:37:49,812 --> 01:37:52,273
- Give me the key.
- Just a sec.

1038
01:37:52,481 --> 01:37:55,276
- Where are we going?
- Come on.

1039
01:38:04,076 --> 01:38:06,829
- What happened?
- I'll tell you later.

1040
01:38:10,124 --> 01:38:12,168
What are you doing?

1041
01:38:14,003 --> 01:38:16,339
Max, please.

1042
01:38:22,220 --> 01:38:24,972
I gotta stop by and get some money
from a friend.

1043
01:39:11,936 --> 01:39:15,231
Where are you, man? Willy?

1044
01:39:23,030 --> 01:39:24,740
Shit.

1045
01:39:28,911 --> 01:39:30,746
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1046
01:39:30,913 --> 01:39:33,332
I'll fucking hurt your fucking ass.

1047
01:39:34,959 --> 01:39:38,254
Don't tell me ''wait.'' I'm gonna put
your fucking brains on that wall!

1048
01:39:38,421 --> 01:39:41,382
- Let me explain.
- You knew I'd be back, didn't you?

1049
01:39:42,008 --> 01:39:44,719
Please let me explain to you
what happened.

1050
01:39:51,058 --> 01:39:52,268
Go ahead, run it.

1051
01:39:52,810 --> 01:39:55,771
I had the car pointed the right way.

1052
01:39:55,938 --> 01:39:58,065
The motor was on.

1053
01:39:58,482 --> 01:40:00,818
I was watching my clock,
I was watching the door.

1054
01:40:01,110 --> 01:40:03,196
The burglar alarm went off
for five minutes.

1055
01:40:03,362 --> 01:40:05,281
That's bullshit, man.

1056
01:40:06,324 --> 01:40:08,451
That's bullshit, man.

1057
01:40:09,994 --> 01:40:14,123
- Max--
- No, no. No, man, I would've been there.

1058
01:40:14,582 --> 01:40:16,417
I'm running because of you, sucker man.

1059
01:40:16,584 --> 01:40:19,170
That shit under the bed?
I went to jail because of you.

1060
01:40:20,755 --> 01:40:22,215
I'm sorry.

1061
01:40:22,798 --> 01:40:26,052
Well, you know, sorry ain't shit now.
You know why?

1062
01:40:27,386 --> 01:40:29,347
It don't mean nothing.

1063
01:40:30,014 --> 01:40:31,641
Come on, Max.

1064
01:40:32,558 --> 01:40:35,144
- Are you high?
- No.

1065
01:40:35,311 --> 01:40:37,772
- Did you get high?
- No.

1066
01:40:40,024 --> 01:40:42,151
Then I don't understand
why you don't hear me.

1067
01:40:42,318 --> 01:40:45,446
I don't understand why you don't
understand what I'm talking about.

1068
01:40:45,613 --> 01:40:46,822
Jerry's dead.

1069
01:40:47,532 --> 01:40:49,659
Just lying on the street, man.

1070
01:40:50,076 --> 01:40:52,870
And that hurts me, man,
because he'd do anything for me.

1071
01:40:53,037 --> 01:40:55,289
He'd do anything for me.

1072
01:40:55,831 --> 01:40:57,875
If he was out in the car, man...

1073
01:40:58,042 --> 01:41:00,211
...there could have been a shitstorm,
you know?

1074
01:41:07,468 --> 01:41:09,470
Max, I'm sorry.

1075
01:41:14,433 --> 01:41:16,352
I got scared.

1076
01:41:18,104 --> 01:41:20,189
I'm scared now.

1077
01:41:21,899 --> 01:41:24,277
You did the best you could, right?

1078
01:41:25,820 --> 01:41:28,948
- I really did.
- I gave you every chance, too, didn't I?

1079
01:41:29,574 --> 01:41:31,826
It wasn't your fault.

1080
01:41:33,077 --> 01:41:34,787
It's over, Willy.

1081
01:41:39,834 --> 01:41:42,795
It's over, man. Forget it.
I shouldn't have asked you to do it.

1082
01:41:42,962 --> 01:41:45,006
It was too heavy for you.

1083
01:41:46,841 --> 01:41:49,176
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right. It's all right, man.

1084
01:41:49,343 --> 01:41:52,221
- What can I do?
- Give me a big bear hug...

1085
01:41:52,430 --> 01:41:54,932
- ...and just forget it.
- Okay.

1086
01:41:55,141 --> 01:41:56,517
I'm sorry.

1087
01:41:56,684 --> 01:41:59,395
- You were wrong, though, you know.
- I know it.

1088
01:41:59,562 --> 01:42:01,480
I'm sorry.

1089
01:42:01,939 --> 01:42:03,566
Shit.

1090
01:42:56,494 --> 01:42:58,162
Did you get it?

1091
01:42:58,329 --> 01:42:59,789
- What?
- The money.

1092
01:42:59,956 --> 01:43:01,290
Yeah.

1093
01:43:05,753 --> 01:43:07,505
Where's the freeway?

1094
01:43:07,672 --> 01:43:09,382
I don't know.

1095
01:43:10,841 --> 01:43:12,593
Well, we're going.

1096
01:43:13,135 --> 01:43:16,013
- All right?
- Let's go. Yeah, let's go.

1097
01:43:56,429 --> 01:43:58,222
How you doing?

1098
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:03,311
- Want me to drive?
- No, I'm all right. Can I have one?

1116
01:45:20,846 --> 01:45:23,015
We didn't start the shooting.

1117
01:45:31,899 --> 01:45:35,069
- Would you pull over for a second?
- Why?

1118
01:45:35,236 --> 01:45:36,946
Please pull over. I don't feel well.

1119
01:45:37,154 --> 01:45:41,033
- Wait till we get to a gas station, will you?
- I can't wait, Max.

1120
01:45:44,203 --> 01:45:47,248
Pull the fucking car over, goddamn it!

1121
01:45:47,874 --> 01:45:51,127
Max, don't you dare lay
a fucking hand on me!

1122
01:46:30,875 --> 01:46:33,794
- What do you wanna do with this?
- I got it.

1123
01:46:36,297 --> 01:46:38,507
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

1124
01:46:38,966 --> 01:46:42,511
Fill it up with regular and you better
check the oil. I think that's all.

1125
01:46:56,984 --> 01:46:58,528
- Want something to drink?
- Yeah.

1126
01:46:58,736 --> 01:47:01,572
Just get me a ginger ale.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

1127
01:47:03,491 --> 01:47:06,911
- You wanna give us a ginger ale and a beer?
- What kind of beer?

1128
01:47:07,078 --> 01:47:09,288
- It doesn't matter. We'll be over here.
- Yeah. Anyway...

1129
01:47:09,455 --> 01:47:12,667
...he starts back to her at the door
and I think he's not gonna say anything.

1130
01:47:12,833 --> 01:47:15,211
And he looks up at me
with the football helmet...

1131
01:47:15,378 --> 01:47:19,131
...and he says, ''Lady,
I sure hope your team wins.''

1132
01:47:44,240 --> 01:47:48,035
- Here we are, sir. Here you go.
- Thank you.

1133
01:47:48,202 --> 01:47:51,163
- And can I get you something else?
- No, that's okay.

1134
01:47:51,372 --> 01:47:53,457
I got some fine
homemade chili for you.

1135
01:47:53,624 --> 01:47:57,420
- This'll do it.
- All right. That'll be 90 cents, if you please.

1136
01:47:57,587 --> 01:47:59,714
I saw a sign outside.
Is there a bus stop here?

1137
01:47:59,881 --> 01:48:02,550
Yeah. That would be
the local Palmdale transportation.

1138
01:48:02,717 --> 01:48:03,968
It stops twice a day.

1139
01:48:04,135 --> 01:48:09,098
The schedule's kind of irregular, but--
Where were you going?

1140
01:48:11,517 --> 01:48:14,103
- Where you kids going, honey?
- L.A.

1141
01:48:15,146 --> 01:48:20,443
Oh, L.A. You take the Palmdale bus from
here, as I say, and go down into Palmdale.

1142
01:48:20,610 --> 01:48:24,071
- Make your connection to L.A. there.
- What time does it get here?

1143
01:48:24,238 --> 01:48:26,282
You got about half an hour.

1144
01:48:26,490 --> 01:48:27,909
- I'll get your change.
- Keep it.

1145
01:48:28,075 --> 01:48:30,244
Oh, thanks, yeah.

1146
01:48:37,168 --> 01:48:39,212
You sending me home?

1147
01:48:43,174 --> 01:48:45,092
Yeah, you are.

1148
01:48:57,230 --> 01:48:59,815
Please, Max, I don't want any money.

1149
01:49:02,527 --> 01:49:04,362
I want you to have it.

1150
01:49:17,291 --> 01:49:19,001
What are you gonna do?

1151
01:49:26,842 --> 01:49:28,719
Will you call me?

1152
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:50,783
Gotta go.

1153
01:50:18,728 --> 01:50:20,688
Forgot my sweater.

1154
01:50:24,609 --> 01:50:26,235
Why can't I go with you?

1155
01:50:27,945 --> 01:50:29,822
Because I wanna get caught.
