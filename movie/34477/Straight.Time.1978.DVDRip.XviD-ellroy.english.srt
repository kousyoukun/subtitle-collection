1
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,797
Open the gate.

2
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,196
You guys wanna step up to the table?

3
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,552
Open the gate, please.

4
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,910
- Can I help you?
- A dog.

5
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,718
Everything on it?

6
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,149
Hey. Hey. Sixty-five cents.

7
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,671
Mr. Frank, please.

8
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,279
No.

9
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,192
Well, my name's Dembo, A-20284.

10
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,956
Dembo, A-20284. Okay?

11
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,351
Just tell him that I'm here and I'll just...
I'll see him tomorrow morning.

12
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,318
I got an appointment with him.
Nothing important.

13
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,357
Yeah, okay. Thank you.

14
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,795
- Hi, Max.
- Hi.

15
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,393
Earl Frank.

16
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,834
Come on in.

17
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,914
Have a seat.

18
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,153
- You're a little late.
- I had some trouble getting down here.

19
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,788
- Want a coffee?
- Yeah, thanks.

20
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,594
Black.

21
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,790
So fill me in. How was the trip?

22
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,077
On the bus down? It was a little long.

23
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,071
- We made about 27 stops.
- Yeah, it's a real milk train.

24
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,071
Go ahead. Put it down on the floor.

25
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,992
So, what'd you do last night?

26
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,037
Oh, walked around.

27
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,554
- Meet anybody?
- No, nobody I know.

28
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,030
Where'd you stay?
You didn't go to the halfway house.

29
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,714
- I called. Didn't you get the message?
- You called here?

30
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,553
Last night. I left a message
with your answering service.

31
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,472
- I didn't get it.
- I left it.

32
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,629
So where'd you sleep?

33
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,349
In a motel.

34
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,432
The conditions of your parole
were that you were to go to the house.

35
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,192
That's a way to help you save money.

36
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,396
Now, you agreed to that
before your release.

37
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,595
Why didn't you go there?

38
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,116
Because I just spent six years
in prison.

39
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,317
I just wanted to look at the lights.
I wanted to feel free.

40
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,072
I wanted to walk around...

41
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,516
...and not have somebody tell me
that I gotta get in bed at 10:00.

42
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,112
Max, I think you've got
a serious attitude problem.

43
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,471
I don't have an attitude.

44
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,036
Can you tell me what kind of attitude
you want me to have?

45
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,118
Well, you don't decide whether or not
you go to a halfway house.

46
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,999
I mean, you come to me,
we discuss it, then I decide.

47
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,839
I'm trying to make you understand, I'm
aware of the realities of my situation...

48
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,992
...that I'm not fated
to be a menace to society.

49
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,549
I'm not gonna go out
and hit somebody over the head.

50
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,596
My friend, I see that you're gonna
force me to deal with you.

51
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,151
I see that you've got juvenile offenses
dating back to when you were 12.

52
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,073
I see you've got auto theft,
you've got breaking and entering.

53
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,117
All this leading up to
a burglary warrant.

54
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,475
I just served six years
for that chickenshit rap.

55
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,837
Chickenshit? You had a gun.

56
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,794
Yeah, but I didn't use it
and I didn't hurt nobody.

57
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,155
What was in your mind
when you put it in your pocket?

58
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,951
I just took it along.

59
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,151
I'm due in court.

60
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,797
I'm aware that you have this power,
that you represent the state...

61
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,758
...but, you know, I think that
you can give me a little leeway.

62
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,194
You can be flexible.

63
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,476
I was just hoping
to get some trust from you.

64
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,916
You've gotta earn the trust.

65
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,351
I have. I just wanna
be like everybody else.

66
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,830
I just want a decent job.
I want a decent place to live.

67
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,753
I want somebody to love me,
I want some clothes on my back...

68
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,997
...have some self-respect.
- I gotta get going now.

69
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,270
I tried to be straight with you, sir.

70
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,910
I shouldn't have done that last night
without checking with you first.

71
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,274
I'm sorry.

72
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,553
I'm sorry.

73
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,438
I'll make a deal with you, Max.

74
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,672
If you find a place to sleep today
and a job by the end of the week...

75
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,070
...you don't have to go
to a halfway house. Fair?

76
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,351
That's fair. I appreciate that.

77
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,876
When you find a place, you call
Miss De Veccio and give her the address.

78
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,871
I'm gonna see you one day this week.

79
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,189
That's okay.

80
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,669
Here's the other hundred
you've got coming to you.

81
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,115
I want you to sign for it.

82
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,109
Now, do you understand
the conditions of your parole?

83
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,635
- Yes, I do.
- You have to attend all meetings.

84
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,997
You must heed the advice
and the counsel of your agent.

85
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,673
- Now, do you know what that means?
- Yeah, I think I do.

86
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,389
I gotta get along with you
or you're gonna throw me back in jail.

87
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,879
That's it in a nutshell.

88
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,077
- You're a tough man.
- No, I'm not, Max.

89
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,118
All right, I gotta go now.

90
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,996
- Good luck with it, now, huh?
- Okay.

91
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,957
I'm gonna do my best.

92
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,273
I know you're gonna do it.

93
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,878
- How much?
- Eighteen dollars a week.

94
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,433
Okay.

95
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,430
- Here's your key.
- Clean sheets?

96
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,637
No. Bathroom is over there.

97
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,679
<i>Parole office. May I help you?</i>

98
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,558
Could you leave a message
for Mr. Frank?

99
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,635
<i>- Who 's calling?</i>
- My name is Max Dembo, A-20284.

100
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,916
- What?
<i>- I got that.</i>

101
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,150
- A-20284.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

102
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,276
Could you tell him I'm
at the Garland Hotel?

103
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,715
That's G-A-R-L-A-N-D.

104
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,515
And you'd better give him
the phone number. It's 321-1321.

105
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,990
<i>- I'll give him the message.</i>
- I'd appreciate it if he gets it today.

106
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,630
<i>- I'll give him the message, sir.</i>
- Okay, thank you. Bye-bye.

107
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,478
Time's up.

108
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,392
Time's up.

109
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,554
- Time's up. I'm sorry.
- I just wanted to finish that sentence.

110
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,551
Bring those score sheets.

111
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,597
You did great
on your intelligence test.

112
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,194
Yeah, well, you know.
I could have told you that.

113
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,149
One moment.

114
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,191
Wilshire Agency.

115
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,953
Yes, she is. Hold on.

116
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,872
Pat, it's for you.

117
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,914
- Did you put it on hold, honey?
- Yeah.

118
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,115
Hello?

119
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,114
Disconnected. I lost the call.

120
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,239
You're supposed to push down "Hold"
before you use these other buttons.

121
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,710
- There's "Hold," there's the buttons.
- Okay.

122
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,232
I'm sorry.

123
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,832
- Did you just get this job?
- Yeah. I've had it about a week.

124
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,834
- Is she your boss?
- Yeah.

125
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,912
Does she really like you
as much as she seems to?

126
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,150
I guess. I don't know.

127
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,198
You got a 61 on your typing test.

128
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,919
- Is that bad?
- I'm afraid it's a little low.

129
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,798
Well, I'm not used to the electric.

130
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,113
What was your last
place of employment?

131
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,430
Were you self-employed
or in the armed services?

132
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,151
No. I didn't know whether to put down
"state penitentiary."

133
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,597
I was a convict.

134
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,509
And how long
did you hold that position?

135
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,592
Approximately six years. No vacation.

136
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,478
What'd you do?

137
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,919
Burglary.

138
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,795
You know, I know I fouled up
that typing test...

139
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,952
...but I do know how
to work a manual...

140
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,476
...and if you get any calls
for a manual typist...

141
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,471
...I'd appreciate it, you know?

142
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,119
Well, I'll see what I can do.

143
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,918
All I wanna...

144
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,670
All I wanna do is get a job.

145
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,036
I need a fucking job.

146
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,192
I believe you.

147
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,877
Well, let me see.

148
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,996
I'm sorry to be a problem.

149
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,628
You know, like I can't drive a car
without permission.

150
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,155
- Why not?
- Well, it's a parole restriction.

151
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,916
I can't handle money, you know,
and it's like I'm limited...

152
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,719
...in terms of what
they allow me to do.

153
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,398
Is there anything at all?

154
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,869
How about the National Can Company?

155
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,157
- Think they'd let you work there?
- Yeah.

156
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,837
- I think that'd be all right with them.
- It's not much. It's only scale.

157
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,230
You wanna try? Okay.

158
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,755
Let's see what we've got here.

159
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,993
Well, go here and see what they say.

160
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,748
Listen, if I get this job,
can I celebrate by taking you to dinner?

161
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,272
You're not sure?

162
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,796
Is that a half yes?

163
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,192
I guess so.

164
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,076
When you go there,
I hope you get the job.

165
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,832
- Thanks for your time.
- Good luck.

166
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,958
- Thank you.
- Let me know what happens.

167
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,593
Okay.

168
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,873
- <i>Hello? Who is it?</i>
- Who is this?

169
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,314
<i>This is Henry Darin.</i>

170
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,835
- Henry Darin? I've heard about you.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

171
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,797
- Is your daddy there?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

172
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,350
Well, you tell him that somebody
wants to give the big bear a bear hug.

173
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,794
<i>- Who is it?</i>
- Just tell him...

174
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,838
...somebody wants to give the big bear
a bear hug. He'll know.

175
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,232
<i>Dad! Someone wants to give you</i>
<i>a big-bear big bear hug!</i>

176
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,799
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Willy?

177
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,518
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- It's Max.

178
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,829
<i>Dembo?</i>

179
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,752
- How you doing?
<i>- Max, thank... Goddamn.</i>

180
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,273
- Is that your boy?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

181
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,749
The last time you wrote,
he was learning how to walk.

182
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,512
<i>Well, where the hell are you?</i>

183
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,750
I got no wheels yet.
You wanna come get me?

184
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,148
<i>Yes! Tell me where you are.</i>

185
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,709
Well, why don't I meet you
on 7th and Alvarado?

186
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,030
- If I'm not there, wait for me, all right?
<i>- Okay.</i>

187
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,599
- You coming now?
<i>- I'm coming now.</i>

188
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,149
- Okay. I'll see you.
<i>- Okay. Yeah.</i>

189
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,758
- How you doing?
- Good. Get in the back, Bart. In the back!

190
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,109
- How you doing? Good to see you.
- It's going well.

191
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,999
Good. Rock 'n' roll!

192
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,069
- How you doing?
- Doing good.

193
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,795
- You working?
- I'm riveting.

194
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,952
Kitchens and bathrooms
in portable homes.

195
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,079
How'd you get the job?

196
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,000
Well, when I came out,
the parole officer got it for me...

197
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,073
...and when I got off parole, Selma said,
"It's good enough. Why not keep it?"

198
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,708
You'll be a riveter
the rest of your life, man.

199
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,996
Shit, no, man.
I'm working on my time.

200
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,435
I'm getting my drums together.
I'm gonna play.

201
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,479
Holy Jesus!

202
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,791
- You the one I talked to on the phone?
- Shake hands with Max Dembo.

203
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,632
- This is my son, Henry.
- How you doing?

204
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,836
Tell him a knock-knock joke.
He's got tons.

205
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,275
- Knock-knock.
- Who's there?

206
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,110
- You.
- You who?

207
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,554
Gotcha. I know that one.

208
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,836
Hey, look what
I found downtown, Mama.

209
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,319
Henry.

210
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,512
- Come on, Bart!
- Get inside there.

211
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,830
- Hello, Max.
- Hi, Selma.

212
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,560
- You didn't bring any beer, did you?
- Was I supposed to?

213
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,312
- I got it.
- Good.

214
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,879
How about some spaghetti?

215
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,350
- Get inside. Get in, come on.
- Oh, God. Jesus, come on inside.

216
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,479
- Come on, come on. Get in.
- God dog, that smells good.

217
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,751
Show Max your muscle.
Make it. Make it big.

218
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,638
Pretty hard. Let me see the other one.

219
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,836
Make two of them.
Two of them at once, here.

220
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,672
You work out?

221
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,790
Does he work out? Come here.

222
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,077
- Show Max what we do on Saturdays.
- You teaching him to defend himself?

223
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,196
You bet your ass. On our days off.

224
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,078
- How could you teach him?
- Got one in.

225
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,071
Got one in there. Come on.

226
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,077
- Okay, okay.
- He's gonna whip your ass.

227
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,593
Where's them cigars?

228
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,876
Hey. I told...

229
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,915
So he's...

230
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,833
Don't be hitting me
when I'm not looking at you.

231
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,230
Oh, he's just playing.

232
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,232
You defend yourself pretty good there.

233
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,676
- You been in many fights?
- Yeah, 10.

234
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,799
- Ten? Not bad. How many you won?
- Eighteen.

235
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,111
Really? That's not a bad record.

236
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,436
Eighteen out of 10.

237
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,359
Hey, how you feel?
You wanna go out and hit the tubs?

238
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,555
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

239
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,598
I think he'd better go in
and clean up his room now.

240
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,436
Selma, let me have about 10 minutes
with him, because I wanna make it...

241
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,352
- I didn't mean to get mad.
- I know.

242
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,432
- He's gotta get to bed early, okay?
- Just let... We...

243
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,790
Let him go in
and clean up his room, okay?

244
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,110
He's gotta get up early
tomorrow morning.

245
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,715
- Okay?
- Okay.

246
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,636
Come here. I get a kiss.

247
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,750
- I get one too. Good night.
- Give Max a kiss. That's it.

248
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,871
Everybody gets a kiss.

249
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,110
- Hey, I'm sorry.
- Okay.

250
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,474
I didn't mean to get mad.

251
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,789
Okay?

252
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,430
Didn't mean to get mad at you.

253
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,236
See you later. Excuse me.

254
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,320
I'll be getting that board together.

255
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,152
You got any more coffee?

256
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,438
That Henry is a nice boy.

257
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,192
Yes, he is.

258
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,591
Come here, man. Get up here.

259
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,909
Come on. Get up here.

260
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,469
Come on. Get up here.

261
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,915
Sit up here. Smart dog.

262
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,513
Come here.

263
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,838
Want something to eat?
Okay if I give him some ice cream?

264
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,718
Sure. He'll eat anything,

265
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,838
Next time I'm down here,
I'm gonna bring him a steak bone.

266
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,310
In fact, as soon as Willy turns his back,
I'm gonna steal this dog.

267
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,948
You know, Max,
I don't wanna hurt your feelings...

268
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,714
...but your being around here
is kind of bad timing for us.

269
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,359
Why is that?

270
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,715
Well, Willy's been doing real good,
you know.

271
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,873
He's been doing real fine.
He's been working hard lately.

272
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,155
And I know you're good friends
and he really loves you...

273
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,797
...but I just don't think it's good
that he see you right now.

274
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,868
You know what I mean?

275
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,759
You trying to tell me you don't
want me to come here no more?

276
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,875
I don't mean to be unkind.

277
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,839
I just think it's better that he doesn't
get around other influences and stuff.

278
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,588
You're on parole now, Max.

279
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,111
Well, you really shouldn't even
be seen with Willy, right?

280
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,678
I think I get the message.

281
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,956
You make me feel bad.

282
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,955
Why? You're just doing
what you have to do, Selma.

283
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,992
It's no problem.

284
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,753
It's cool.

285
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,113
This is it.

286
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,955
- Here. Let me get it.
- I'll get the front.

287
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,792
- You sure?
- Yeah.

288
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,191
- All right. It's three flights up.
- I gotta piss, so you'd better run.

289
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,759
All right.

290
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,990
Remember that place called The Hague?
Right across from the Cocoanut Grove.

291
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,628
- Where do you want it?
- Put it underneath the bed there.

292
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,190
Last time I was there, Hampton Hawes
and Chet Baker were playing there.

293
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,191
- Is it still open?
- I don't know.

294
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,638
- Three flights of stairs killed me.
- Go back in the joint, you'll get in shape.

295
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,836
- Hold it up.
- I got it.

296
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,990
- You sure it don't have termites?
- It's okay.

297
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,755
How does it feel?
That's the main thing.

298
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,194
It's good, isn't it?

299
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,191
I know where we could go.

300
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,193
- The Autoway Club.
- The what?

301
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,920
The Autoway Club. Remember that?
We used to go there?

302
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,196
- We could go.
- Do a little fucking around, maybe.

303
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,749
Yeah. Maybe we could
go to Hermosa Beach too.

304
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,478
Oh, yeah.

305
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,275
- Howard Rumsey...
- Yeah.

306
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,396
...and his Lighthouse All-Stars.

307
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,348
All right, let's go there. Maybe there'll be
some nice little girls there I can...

308
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,276
You can get me three years for that.

309
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,713
Sorry.

310
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,597
I got excited, that's all.

311
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,955
Does Selma know you're using?

312
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,475
Well, she's always suspicious.

313
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,588
The machine broke down,
so I gotta stay.

314
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,592
What do you want me to tell you?
I'll probably be about two or three hours.

315
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,398
Well, I'm glad.

316
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,357
All right. Bye.

317
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,389
<i>- Hello. Jenny Mercer speaking.</i>
- Hi. How you doing? This is Max Dembo.

318
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,028
Thank you for making me
a bona fide member of society.

319
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,509
<i>Oh, you got the job? That's great.</i>

320
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,910
- Why don't you have dinner with me?
<i>- When?</i>

321
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,595
I could be there in an hour and a half.
I wanna go shower and change.

322
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,910
<i>Actually, I was planning on</i>
<i>staying home tonight.</i>

323
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,152
It's just that it's the first chance I have
to celebrate something.

324
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,992
You know? I want to...

325
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,232
You know, I wanna have a steak.
I thought you could keep me company.

326
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,234
- I don't even know what to order.
<i>- Okay.</i>

327
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,753
- Is that okay?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

328
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:33,596
All right, can I be at your office,
let's say about 5:30?

329
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,909
<i>- See you then.</i>
- All right.

330
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,957
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Bye-bye.

331
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,793
All I'm saying is, out here, the rules
aren't defined. On the inside, they are.

332
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,430
If you don't pay back your debts, if you
owe a couple packs of cigarettes...

333
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,434
...if you take somebody's glove or
lie to someone, then you get killed.

334
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,560
You know that's the rules,
so you live by them.

335
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,595
You can get killed with a sharp edge...

336
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,478
...the end of this spoon.

337
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,119
That's a lethal weapon.

338
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,998
Even the end of a toothbrush.

339
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,472
You can get hit in the yard
or you can get it in the shower.

340
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,834
You're in your cell sleeping, someone can
go by with a can of gas and throw it in.

341
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,230
Somebody else throws in a match
and you're torched.

342
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,551
You know that's the reality
and you're living with it 24 hours a day.

343
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,589
That's frightening.

344
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,718
A lot of guys think this is more
frightening, being on the outside.

345
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,314
Why? I don't understand.

346
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,914
Because out here, it's what you
got in your pocket that matters...

347
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,992
...and on the inside,
it's only what you are.

348
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,193
You're glad to be out, aren't you?

349
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:48,630
It's like a dream.
It's every con's fantasy to be out here.

350
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:55,316
I can't tell you the number of times
I thought about a scene just like this...

351
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,958
...but I never thought I'd be sitting here
with a knot in my stomach.

352
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,870
Tell me more about that guy
you were going with.

353
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,632
How long were you with him?

354
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,113
I lived with him for about two years.

355
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,236
Who broke it off?

356
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,152
I did.

357
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,434
Thank you very much.
Come on back again.

358
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,229
Wanna know something?
I'm glad you asked me out.

359
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,195
Don't you have enough money?

360
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,428
I think I got enough for the tax.

361
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,229
Here, I've got some.

362
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,437
Wait a minute.
I wanted this to be my treat.

363
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,275
Why don't we just walk out?

364
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,154
You don't wanna do that, do you?

365
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,269
I'll make a deal. If you'll go out with me
tomorrow night, I'll let you help me.

366
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,030
Okay, you've got a deal.

367
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,350
All right, be discreet
and slip it under the table.

368
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,869
Hi, how you doing?

369
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,269
Okay.

370
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,273
I was in the neighborhood,
so I had your manager let me in.

371
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,557
- Mind if I come in?
- Sure. Come on, it's your home.

372
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,870
I mean, this is just routine, you know.

373
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,918
It's a nice room.
You've got cross-ventilation. Nice view.

374
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,992
- Yeah, it's nice.
- What they charge you for?

375
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,594
It's $ 17 a week.

376
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,513
- That's better than $ 17 in a motel.
- Yeah.

377
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,999
- You're right.
- I know.

378
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,072
Do you mind if I change?
I gotta be somewhere in a half-hour.

379
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,152
No, go right ahead.
Don't let me hold you up. Go ahead.

380
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,798
- What do you got, a date?
- Yeah.

381
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,552
Is she white?

382
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,836
I'm just joking.

383
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,199
So...

384
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,554
...who is she?

385
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,234
I met her at the employment agency.
She works there.

386
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:05,279
In fact, she sent me for a job
and I went over there and I got it.

387
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,238
Great. Great. What kind of work is it?

388
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,152
Well, it's just a can company,
you know.

389
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,878
- Regular wage?
- Yeah.

390
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,271
Well, that's a start.
Did you tell them you were on parole?

391
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,793
No. Is that a problem?

392
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,916
Oh, no worry.
I can take care of that.

393
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,196
You've got a room,
you've got a job, the whole...

394
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,511
You gave me a week, so yeah.
It's over in Verona.

395
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,312
What's this?

396
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,670
- Just matches.
- I know that.

397
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,432
Take off your shirt.
Let's see your arms.

398
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,875
- They're not mine.
- Max, take off your shirt.

399
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,319
What's this?

400
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,155
That's just a scratch I got
on the job today. It's not tracks.

401
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,636
- Let me see this one.
- You won't find nothing.

402
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,631
Just let me do my work.

403
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,475
- Where'd you get all those scars?
- It's just burns.

404
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,949
- When you were a kid?
- Yeah, it was an accident.

405
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,599
Does it hurt?

406
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,716
Let me see the other one.

407
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,795
Did you hear about the Polack
who got third-degree burns on his face?

408
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,676
He was dunking for french fries.

409
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,558
Been drinking some beer, huh?

410
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,392
Yeah. Just a couple cans, though.

411
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,755
- What are you doing?
- Come on, Max.

412
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,070
Come on, Max. Come on, now.
Take it easy.

413
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,356
Why'd you do that?
You didn't have to chain me.

414
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,511
- It's procedure.
- I told you, I'm clean.

415
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,908
Then you got nothing
to worry about.

416
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,435
Just come over here and check me
if you got a doubt.

417
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,756
- If you're clean...
- What do you mean, "if"?

418
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,229
You didn't check me properly.
Did you check my eyes?

419
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,391
If you're clean,
you got nothing to worry about.

420
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,393
I gotta make a phone call,
then we'll take you down and test you.

421
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,519
- I could save you a lot of trouble.
- It's no trouble. It's what I get paid for.

422
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,476
We're just playing a game.

423
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,876
All right. Come on, follow me.

424
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,557
Come on. Keep it up.

425
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,798
All right, move right in here.

426
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,476
- Gentlemen, follow the red line.
- Take your hat off.

427
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,114
- Right in the corner, facing me.
- Take your hat off.

428
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,030
Start with you, right over in this corner.
Facing me, gentlemen.

429
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,350
Everybody facing me.

430
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,516
In case you don't know where you are,
this is the Los Angeles County Jail.

431
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,912
Welcome, and empty your pockets
on the floor. Everything out.

432
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,914
Cigarettes, money, matches,
everything. On the floor.

433
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,036
Turn your pockets inside out
after you get everything out.

434
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,516
Okay, gentlemen, I want you to run
your fingers through your hair.

435
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,430
Shake it out good.

436
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,158
Shake it out good.

437
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,798
- Is that a wig?
- Yeah, it's a wig.

438
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,190
Take it off. Put it on the floor.

439
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,156
Run your hands through your hair.

440
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,594
Okay, gentlemen, put your hands
out in front of you, palms up.

441
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,916
Okay, turn over.

442
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,475
Okay, gentlemen, turn around
and grab a piece of the wall.

443
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,198
Step back. Spread your feet.

444
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,030
As soon as you take your clothes off,
I want you to sit on a bench.

445
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,914
Okay, move on.

446
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,275
Don't be afraid to use some soap.

447
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,192
All right, gentlemen,
you in the shower, let's move it out.

448
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,830
We don't have all day.
That water's not free.

449
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,157
Take your showers and get out.

450
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:13,791
As soon as you step out of your shower,
grab a towel and step over on the side.

451
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,520
Dry yourself off thoroughly.

452
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,591
Let's go, gentlemen.

453
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,878
Turn around.

454
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,552
- Go. Let's go, arms up.
- If you were on a bench, get a shower.

455
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,109
- Small, medium or large?
- Medium.

456
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,512
- Head down. Turn around. Go.
- Let's go, gentlemen.

457
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,150
Get out of the shower and dry off.
We don't have enough time.

458
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,788
- Let's go. Move it out.
- Good hands, Pop.

459
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,396
That one's mine, partner.

460
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,833
Stand clear!

461
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,434
Dembo! Visit!

462
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,316
- Hi, remember me?
- Yeah. How you doing?

463
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,677
- Pretty good. How are you?
- I'm fine.

464
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:53,312
I called and your landlady told me
you were arrested. What happened?

465
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,273
I don't know.

466
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,718
Doesn't matter.

467
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,434
I got worried. I was waiting and...

468
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,078
When are you getting out?

469
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,155
I don't know.
It's a little hard to say.

470
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,600
You don't mind my coming here, do you?

471
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:25,113
I called earlier and they said
the visiting room closes at 3.

472
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,555
I got lost on the way.

473
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,270
Is there anything I can do?

474
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,238
- No, it's all right.
- What?

475
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,709
Oh, God, there's no more time.
Wait a second.

476
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,913
- I gotta go.
- Wait. Wait.

477
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,552
Call me when you get out.

478
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,518
Call me. It's my home phone.

479
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,712
Okay?

480
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:51,233
This terrific-Iooking blond goes into this
dentist's office and she's really scared.

481
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,109
She climbs up into the chair as the
dentist prepares his utensils and things.

482
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,317
And just as he turns around
and is about to look into her mouth...

483
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,472
...she blurts out,
"Oh, doctor, I'm so afraid of dentists...

484
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,632
...I think I'd rather have a baby
than have a tooth drilled."

485
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,872
"Well, miss," the doctor says,
"you'd better make up your mind...

486
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,429
...before I adjust the chair."

487
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,835
So how you doing?

488
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,153
How do you think I'm doing,
slammed down?

489
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,953
What?

490
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,232
I'm okay.

491
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,075
Listen, your urine tested clean.

492
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,958
I'm sorry you got stuck here,
but I've had my hands full this week.

493
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,476
- This is the first time I could reach you.
- Did the phones break down?

494
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,558
Don't get sarcastic with me, Dembo.

495
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,436
I'm having you released from here.
I'll take you to a halfway house myself.

496
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,319
- When is that? Now?
- Right now.

497
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,835
I think that's more than generous.

498
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,749
You're the boss.

499
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,753
Right. You're smart enough
to recognize a break when you get one.

500
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,309
Now, you were clean,
but somebody fixed in your room.

501
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,313
That's a violation of your parole
and it's enough to get you...

502
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,436
...a minimum of two to three years.

503
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,158
Am I right?

504
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,035
- So we'll start from scratch.
- Sure.

505
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,953
We'll get you cleaned up
and we'll get you out of here.

506
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,280
- Okay.
- All right.

507
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,392
Sometimes this job
is getting to be too much.

508
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,596
You wouldn't believe the week
I had last week.

509
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,877
I missed my girl's school play.
My wife was so pissed off at me...

510
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,712
...I thought she was gonna
divorce me.

511
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,270
On top of that, I got a call that one
of my guys was holed up in his house.

512
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,512
Threatening his wife with a shotgun.
Guess how I handled that one.

513
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,954
I used my head.

514
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,391
I called his father in Detroit...

515
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,030
...then I got them talking on the phone.
They must have talked for three hours.

516
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,397
All this is person-to-person.
It's costing the state.

517
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:54,111
<i>- Top of the seventh inning, Dodgers</i>
<i>leading 10-2. Scored 10 each game.</i>

518
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,875
Damn it. You know, I had 10 bucks
on that game.

519
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,433
Everything you got check out?

520
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,356
- Yeah.
- Good.

521
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,750
Cooking spoon's not there, is it?

522
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,555
Come on. Just between you and me,
this doesn't go any further...

523
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,517
...who was it shot up in your room?

524
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,955
I just can't tell you that.

525
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,915
I'm taking you to a halfway house.
I'm not taking you back to the joint.

526
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,150
You asked for my trust.
I'm giving it to you.

527
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,517
- How about giving a little back in return?
- I can't tell you that.

528
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:30,593
Bullshit. If you can't trust me, what
the hell, I'm just wasting gas driving.

529
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:34,196
- I don't want you to waste your gas.
- Then tell me who it was.

530
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,799
Christ, you're gonna kill us!

531
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,997
Put your hands down.

532
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,149
Put them down. Go on.

533
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,039
Don't fuck with me, sucker.
You busted me for nothing!

534
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,555
You big, bald fucker!

535
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,871
You're finished.
You made your choice.

536
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,792
Max!

537
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:56,714
- Damn you sons of bitches!
- Hey, fatso, where's your pants?

538
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,593
- Hey, how you doing, man?
- Hey, my friend.

539
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,955
- How you been?
- Haven't seen you in a while.

540
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,633
I know, I got hung up for a while.

541
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,109
- What you got going?
- I need your car.

542
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,633
- The keys are in it.
- All right.

543
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,872
- Hey, take me with you.
- I can't. I gotta see some people.

544
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,439
Be back in a couple hours.

545
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,239
- Next time, I wanna go with you.
- All right, you got it.

546
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,197
- I'm not shitting you.
- I hear you.

547
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,838
- If I go with you, I can drive. I can get...
- You got it.

548
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,116
Hey, my radio.

549
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,838
I'll be back, couple hours.

550
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,149
Where's he going?

551
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:56,357
He's going to the store.
He'll be back in a minute.

552
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,876
- How are you? What's to it, Manny?
- How you doing, man?

553
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,270
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

554
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,237
I wanna talk.

555
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,274
- Yeah.
- I mean right now, okay?

556
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,711
- If anybody asks for me, I'm not here.
- All right.

557
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,718
- What do you wanna talk about?
- I just need your help.

558
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,799
- What do you want, money?
- I want a pistol.

559
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,712
No, I don't do that, Max.

560
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,509
- You don't keep a piece in your office?
- I don't play around with guns.

561
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,997
You owe me one, Manny.
You owe me one.

562
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,157
Come on.

563
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,398
Shut the door.

564
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,632
- I got something we took off a drunk.
- Just give me what you have.

565
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,598
I just gotta get my hands
on some heavy stuff, you know?

566
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,196
I need a Thompson,
you know, a Magnum.

567
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,036
Maybe a shotgun.
Can you raise that for me?

568
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,077
- Takes a lot of cash, Max.
- What is this?

569
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,470
It's a piece of shit.
We took it off a drunk.

570
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,200
- Does it work?
- I don't know. I don't play with those.

571
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,397
- Makes my dick hard.
- It's yours.

572
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,430
You put up the money,
I'll take care of you.

573
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:01,910
- I ain't got that kind of cash.
- You're doing a lot of business out there.

574
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,559
How much time do you need?

575
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:07,076
- Give me a couple of days.
- You got it.

576
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:11,918
I read you, Manny. Try for it tonight.
I'll call your house in the morning.

577
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,517
Give me one full day. Go that way.
Go the side way.

578
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,511
One full day.

579
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,512
Take it easy and you won't get hurt.

580
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,352
Give me the money.

581
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,518
Open the register.

582
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,358
Open the register.

583
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,714
Does he speak English?

584
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,598
Better tell him to open the register.

585
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,273
Open the fucking register
or I'll blow your fucking head off.

586
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,000
- Open it. You feel that? You feel that?
- Yeah.

587
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,434
Open it.

588
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,555
Get down. Get down.

589
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,479
Hold it.

590
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,993
Hold it.

591
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,239
Don't move.

592
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,912
Don't come out.

593
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,753
What are you thinking about?

594
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:45,159
You know you're
breaking the law right now?

595
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,038
What do you mean?

596
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,069
I mean, a cop could knock
on that door, put you in jail.

597
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,510
Why would he do that?

598
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,991
You're harboring a fugitive.

599
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:02,709
I jumped my parole yesterday.
I'm on the run.

600
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,710
I'll take my chances.

601
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,591
No, I don't want any.

602
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,709
I'd like to take you out tonight...

603
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,917
...but I got some business to do
with some people...

604
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:25,072
...so why don't you just let me
borrow your car for a while?

605
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,832
Okay.

606
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,198
Promise not to steal it?

607
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,155
Gotta go to work in the morning.

608
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,598
- Damn, you scared me.
- Hey, Max.

609
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,909
Mickey. How you been?

610
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,672
- All right. When did you raise?
- A couple days ago.

611
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:20,230
- Where'd you get those threads?
- Bought them. Let's go sit down, friend.

612
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,992
You're looking good.

613
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,593
- Slick.
- Yeah.

614
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,159
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

615
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,958
Why don't you let us
have that seat...

616
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,429
...so me and my friend
can talk some business?

617
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,838
- So how have you been?
- How long have you been around?

618
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,991
I don't know. A couple years.

619
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,952
- Want a drink?
- Yeah.

620
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:41,238
- Tommy.
- Double Jack Daniel's with a 7 back.

621
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,517
- What do you want?
- I'll have one of these things right here.

622
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,678
How you been?

623
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,756
Ready to make a move.

624
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,798
You got something
you wanna run by me?

625
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,872
I got a sweet poker game in the Valley
you might be interested in.

626
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,918
- Sounds good. What's it good for?
- Fifteen or 20 big ones.

627
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,911
That much? Any guns?

628
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,435
No, just some fat-ass old men, man.

629
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:07,354
They got pacemakers that'll short-circuit
when you charge through the door.

630
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,917
All right, I'm interested.

631
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,513
Can you help me with a partner?

632
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:15,229
What about Kelly Mason?
He comes here all the time.

633
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,152
He'd jump at the chance
to work with you.

634
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,833
Who's that kid that just got up?

635
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,117
That's Augie Morales' brother.

636
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,918
- Is that Augie's kid brother?
- Yeah.

637
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:27,152
- Get him over here.
- Hey, Chungie. Come here.

638
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,317
- How you doing?
- Nice to see you again.

639
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,472
This is Max Dembo, man.
He's a good friend of Augie's.

640
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,392
- Hi.
- You don't remember me, do you?

641
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:38,632
- You're a friend of my brother's, right?
- How's he doing?

642
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,872
He's not doing very well right now.
He's doing 20 years in Arizona...

643
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,759
...and has a lot of problems
in California too.

644
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:48,117
- Can you vouch for him?
- He's as good as Augie was at that age.

645
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,872
Can I get ahold of him through you?

646
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,508
I got his phone number,
or you can catch him in here.

647
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,240
I got something for you, maybe.
We'll talk later, okay?

648
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,755
- Just give me a call.
- Give my love to your brother.

649
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,151
- I will. Thanks very much. See you later.
- All right, take care.

650
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,550
- Does he take shit?
- No, he's too smart for that.

651
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,039
He's a good thief for his age.

652
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,109
Know what I'd like to do?

653
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,317
Run me by that motel.
We'll check it out, then go cut it up.

654
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,398
I'll drive you out there,
but I'm not gonna rob it for you.

655
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:18,075
You've got to do that yourself,
you know. I got stomach trouble.

656
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,037
No guts.

657
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,152
Did I scare you?

658
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,719
Yeah, a little bit.

659
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,435
You gotta go to work pretty soon.

660
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,071
What time is it?

661
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,510
Wanna take a shower with me?

662
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,552
Can I use your phone?

663
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,472
Yeah, go ahead.

664
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,750
Is Jerry Schue there?

665
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:35,032
- Looks like you're fixed up pretty good.
- It's going all right.

666
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,634
After you fell,
I pulled a few jobs and met Carol.

667
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:38,949
She straightened me out...

668
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:42,749
...so I set myself up in the
painting/contracting business. Sit here.

669
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,997
We bought the house.

670
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:49,950
I got that boat. Put the pool in last year.
The only thing I need's a new car.

671
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,952
The one out front belonged to Carol's ex.
It's about had it.

672
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:57,157
When you were at Quentin,
did you know a guy named Don Shaffer?

673
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,356
- I don't think so.
- Kind of a short, squat guy.

674
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,954
- He was my first husband.
- He don't know the man, honey.

675
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:05,351
- You got a place in town, Max, or what?
- Nickname "Lumpy."

676
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,397
I know him.
Was that your first husband?

677
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,834
Yeah, I know Lumpy.

678
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,719
What are we gonna do, honey,
go down the whole damn list?

679
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:14,474
First there was Lumpy,
then it was Steve the bodybuilder...

680
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,278
...greased himself to death...

681
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:19,352
...then Raymond,
who sold us the lemon out front.

682
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,877
- Did I leave any out?
- Oh, will you cut it out?

683
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,793
So how'd you two lovebirds meet?

684
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,995
I met her at a 31 Flavors, of all places.

685
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,310
Yeah, he was 32.

686
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,471
Isn't she a peach?

687
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,951
Why don't we get Sherry
and we could all go out dancing later?

688
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,793
Oh, you mean Sherry,
that blond that threw up in the car...

689
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,313
...the last time we went out?

690
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,677
I know the kind of broad he wants.
A good-Iooking broad. Marlene.

691
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:48,037
- I'd really like a beer, if you have one.
- Sure, I got beer.

692
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:50,270
- Want everything on these burgers?
- Yeah.

693
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,759
Okay. Here.

694
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,278
Thanks.

695
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,153
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

696
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,912
Thank you, honey.

697
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,072
Not bad.

698
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,917
Get me out of here.

699
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:13,629
They're killing me.
I can't make this scene any more.

700
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,392
Get me out of here.

701
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:19,270
You got something.
I know you got something.

702
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,158
Yeah, I got something.

703
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,038
Well, let's do it.

704
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:27,713
- Don't you wanna know what it is?
- I don't give a damn. Let's just do it.

705
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:30,079
What is it?

706
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:33,911
A bunch of old guys play poker
over in a motel in the Valley.

707
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:35,877
They got about $20,000 on the table.

708
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:38,315
We just tiptoe in,
tiptoe out, and it's all ours.

709
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,391
There ain't no cops
because they can't call.

710
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,516
- Great. You got the guns?
- Yeah.

711
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:45,319
- We need a shotgun.
- Here, honey.

712
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,156
I don't know what to play.

713
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:51,039
- You still playing that thing?
- I'm eating, for chrissake.

714
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,918
You can play later, but I'd prefer now.

715
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:54,672
Play that song where you yodel.

716
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:57,274
What's that "Walking Stick" thing
you used to play?

717
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:00,592
What "Walking Stick"? You mean
"Hand Me Down My Walking Cane"?

718
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,876
"Walking Cane," yeah, play that.

719
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:05,315
Come on, we got cause to celebrate.

720
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,272
Alrighty.

721
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:40,314
Oh, shit, Max.

722
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:44,513
All right, Jerry. Take it easy.
We're all right. He'll be here.

723
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,871
Man, this is very unprofessional.

724
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:51,958
All I'm saying is you give the man
10 minutes.

725
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,713
He'll be here. It's all right.

726
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:57,350
It's not all right, man. I've had it.
Get me out of here.

727
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,153
Is that him?

728
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:07,073
Is that him?

729
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:13,159
No. If it was him,
he would have stopped.

730
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:20,190
That's it. They're coming out.
It's over. Let's go.

731
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,396
We're still all right.
We still can do it, man.

732
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:25,358
It's over, man. Look at the people.
They're coming out, man.

733
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:29,035
I mean, I don't care if he shows up
with a 20 mm cannon. It's over.

734
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,033
Fuck it.

735
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:36,233
Jesus. Will you wait a minute, man?
They'll see you.

736
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:39,953
We're all right. There's five
more guys in there. Let's do it.

737
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:42,839
I told you, I'm not taking that game
without a shotgun.

738
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,912
You can't cover a fucking poker game
without a shotgun, all right?

739
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:48,753
The plan was to meet your friend here
with a shotgun...

740
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:51,150
...we go in and do the job
and we leave, all right?

741
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:54,915
Now, we've been sitting here all night
waiting for the guy with the shotgun...

742
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:57,036
...and you wanna take it
with your cap pistol...

743
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:01,193
...and I'm telling you it's very
un-fucking-professional, all right?

744
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:10,756
- That's him.
- If that's him, tell him he's late.

745
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:23,314
- How you doing?
- What's to it, Manny?

746
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:27,115
Some really fucking weird shit.
You know the bartender, the asshole...

747
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,077
What do you got for me?

748
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,469
Go ahead.

749
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,835
I was just gonna...
I didn't come with nothing...

750
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,436
...because the bartender, I gave him
the key to my place to lock up...

751
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,919
So, what'd you bring me?

752
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:41,709
- I didn't bring you nothing. But I...
- Just tell me, why weren't you here?

753
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:44,269
- Well, will you let me explain, Max?
- Yeah, go ahead.

754
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:50,830
There's people up there.
They're gonna see you.

755
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,718
- Are you out of your mind?
- Sorry.

756
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:55,553
Come on, man. Calm down.
You made your point.

757
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:58,598
You were righteous, okay?
Cool it, man. Just cool it.

758
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:01,672
We fucked the score off on...
Hey, hey!

759
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:04,513
We fucked the score off
on account of you, you know that?

760
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:08,275
Will you just settle down?
Get in the car. Please.

761
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:11,159
You know, I counted on him.
He let me down. He was wrong.

762
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:13,709
- So get in the car.
- He was wrong. He let me down.

763
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:18,592
Hey, get in the car.
This ain't gonna make it, man. Okay?

764
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,876
You're wrong, Manny. You know that?

765
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:25,318
- You know that you're wrong, right?
- Come on. There's no money in this.

766
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:31,232
How's it feel
getting fucked out of 20 grand?

767
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,595
It ain't no big thing.
I just wanna get you home.

768
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:34,909
Let's go. It's cold.

769
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:37,230
- I've gotta cool this dude down.
- He won't tell.

770
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:40,472
I'm gonna make sure so I can keep you
on the streets. Turn the key.

771
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,835
- I'm all right.
- You going home?

772
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,719
Tell me the truth. You going home?
You know what you're doing?

773
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:49,190
- I won't let you down next time.
- Turn your lights on.

774
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,672
Come on, baby.

775
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,517
Shit.

776
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,438
Fucker.

777
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:03,599
Hi.

778
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,552
What happened? Where've you been?

779
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,398
I had to take care of some business.

780
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:26,313
What kind of business?
Why are you all dirty?

781
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:28,954
I broke through a wall.

782
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,433
Why?

783
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:34,032
I did something.

784
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:38,076
The place looks nice.

785
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,352
All right.

786
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:44,673
What made you finally decide to unpack?

787
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,915
How far you wanna take this?

788
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,238
I don't know.

789
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,713
I thought we were working on
something here, but maybe I'm wrong.

790
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,357
No. What do you think
I've been doing?

791
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,829
Guess I never really thought about it.

792
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:11,510
Want me to lie and say I work on
a hot-dog stand? I can't do a regular job.

793
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:12,999
I'm not gonna take your money.

794
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:15,914
Well, do you have
an alternative for me?

795
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:17,834
I'm doing what I do.

796
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,514
If you can't take it
and it's too heavy for you...

797
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:22,796
...well, then I'll just walk out the door.

798
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,908
I'll walk, but I don't want to.

799
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:28,271
Was this just a one-time thing, or what?

800
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,319
That depends on how lucky I get.

801
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:33,153
The thing I had going got screwed up,
so I did another thing.

802
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:35,914
I'm just trying to get myself together,
you know?

803
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:40,398
If I could just get a decent score,
just put one thing together...

804
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:44,519
...then we can kick back and maybe
we can get out of here. That's all.

805
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:49,077
So I guess what we're really saying here
is if I can handle it.

806
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:52,035
- That's right.
- I don't want you to go.

807
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,599
And I don't want to either.

808
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:58,679
It's just that this is so totally out of
my experience. You gotta understand.

809
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:02,594
I'll promise you that I won't hurt you,
and whatever I do doesn't involve you.

810
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,398
I keep it outside.

811
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,028
But maybe it'd be better
if you didn't ask me questions.

812
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:12,511
I'll stay with you as long as I can handle
it, but when I can't, I'm gonna go.

813
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:14,878
I know that.

814
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,311
Just be careful.

815
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,875
I want you to know that
what you're doing out there...

816
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,076
...it scares the shit out of me.

817
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,677
It scares me too.

818
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,313
Come here.

819
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,916
You come here.

820
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:51,596
- Can I give you something?
- What is it?

821
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:55,876
Something I found.

822
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:04,913
Come on, now. Don't be scared.

823
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,154
Don't be scared.

824
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,197
I can't help it.

825
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,714
Excuse me, sir,
would you look right over there, please?

826
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:31,757
All right, don't move.
Get up out of there.

827
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:34,070
Get the fuck out of there, man.

828
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:38,193
Get in there.

829
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:46,799
All right, listen to me! This is a robbery!
Everybody on the floor.

830
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,633
- Get down on the goddamn floor!
- Open the drawer.

831
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:54,112
All the way down.
All you tellers, down on the floor.

832
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:58,194
All the way down! Hey, get down!

833
01:15:58,360 --> 01:15:59,588
Open the drawer. Open it up.

834
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,671
Get down before I start killing people!

835
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:04,229
Get your drawer open, honey.
Get your drawer open.

836
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,152
Stop looking at me!

837
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,076
Get down on the goddamn floor!

838
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:14,432
Thirty seconds.

839
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:26,991
Twenty seconds.

840
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:37,837
You in love with me?
Answer me! Are you in love with me?

841
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:42,512
Then stop looking at me, motherfucker,
or I'll blow your goddamn face off!

842
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:46,156
Time's up. Let's go.

843
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:53,312
Let's go.

844
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,796
Let's go!

845
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:02,114
Let's hit it.

846
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,516
Let's go!

847
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:08,350
Get back!

848
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:12,035
Get back. Get down on the floor!

849
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,197
Let's go.

850
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,478
- How much did we get?
- We got a bunch.

851
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:36,518
- How was I? Was I good?
- You scared the shit out of me.

852
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:25,239
Hit it, hit it. Just hit it.
Hit it. Let's go.

853
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:30,511
Make a left here.

854
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,798
- What do we got?
- I don't know. I can't tell yet. It's fat.

855
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:46,112
- What is it? Twenties, 30s, 50s?
- Yeah, there's 20s. There's no 30s, man.

856
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:48,635
- Any ones?
- Yeah, there's a few ones.

857
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:52,031
- A couple hundreds.
- Would you say, 20, 30,000? Forty?

858
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:55,715
What's that look like?
What's that look like to you, huh?

859
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:58,519
- What's this look like, huh?
- Let me feel it.

860
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:01,593
Come on. Asshole.

861
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:04,274
Put it up your fucking snoot, baby.

862
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,237
- Man.
- We got more fucking money here...

863
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,277
Let's go over to your place
and cut it up.

864
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:12,319
- Put it in the bathroom, lock the door...
- Right on the floor.

865
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:15,559
From now on, when I say go,
though, man, we gotta go, man.

866
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:17,551
- When I yell, "Go," go.
- The clock...

867
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,915
The clock, my ass.
We always go through this shit.

868
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:23,356
I'll dock you 8 grand you stopped me
from getting from that last teller.

869
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,999
Eight thousand fucking dollars.

870
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:28,118
It was like pulling teeth
to get you out of the fucking place.

871
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:29,918
So we scored.

872
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,437
- Do you like it?
- Not really. What are we doing here?

873
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,955
Let me buy you something.
What about the earrings?

874
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:40,111
- I think it's a set.
- Look at the ring.

875
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:42,430
The price tag on it's $9135.

876
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:45,751
- I bet that bracelet's worth more than...
- Hello. May I help you?

877
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:50,477
- How much is that?
- Eighteen thousand.

878
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:00,598
- What about this one here?
- Forty-seven five for the set.

879
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:03,399
- With tax or without?
- Without tax.

880
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:05,198
Want a watch?
Where's ladies' watches?

881
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,396
This counter right over here.

882
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:08,949
What are you doing?

883
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:11,236
- I'm getting you a watch.
- I don't want a watch.

884
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:12,913
- Hi.
- Hi. May I show you something?

885
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:15,071
- Can we see some ladies' watches?
- Certainly.

886
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:18,232
- This entire counter, all ladies' watches.
- How about your best one?

887
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:21,039
Best one? Is right here.

888
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,436
- That's all right.
- Isn't that a lovely watch?

889
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,750
It's disgusting.

890
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:28,877
- Let's see this one here.
- Certainly.

891
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:31,349
- I don't like those diamonds.
- Let me put this back.

892
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,118
That's nice.

893
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:39,551
- How much is that?
- That's $2000.

894
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:41,358
I can't wear that to work.

895
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,990
Better show us something less
expensive. She has very simple tastes.

896
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:46,957
It's my upbringing.
What can I tell you?

897
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,111
Here, let's try this one.

898
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,829
- How much is that one?
- This one is $900.

899
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,037
That's pretty. What make is that?

900
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:58,594
Sir? Excuse me.

901
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:00,918
Where are you going?

902
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:03,392
I was just looking for your restroom.

903
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:07,109
I'm sorry, but we don't have
a public restroom here.

904
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:10,829
There's a coffee shop two doors down.
They'll allow you to use their facilities.

905
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,991
Thanks. Did you get
what you wanted?

906
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:15,720
- I like this the best.
- We'll have to think about it.

907
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:17,871
- Very well.
- We'll be back.

908
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:20,110
- Thank you for coming in.
- Bye-bye.

909
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:22,236
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye.

910
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:26,110
- Is there anything else to see upstairs?
- No, those are the executive offices.

911
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:27,429
All right.

912
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:32,713
Look, this is Wilshire Boulevard
right here, right?

913
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,638
All right. Here's the doors.

914
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:38,190
There's glass windows on either side,
and they're tinted, Jerry.

915
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,078
From the outside, you cannot see in.

916
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:42,310
But inside, you can see
all the action outside.

917
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,909
We didn't have that on the bank, right?

918
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:48,119
When I was in there,
the lady showed me one case.

919
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:51,477
In one case, there was over
125 grand of ice there.

920
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,392
In one case?

921
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:55,798
What do you think?

922
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:58,117
I don't know.

923
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:02,955
Beverly Hills is rough, man.
Scares the shit out of me, Beverly Hills.

924
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:04,155
Why's that?

925
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,595
I don't know.
Well, how many cops they got there?

926
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:09,320
They got 100 cops
in six square miles, you know.

927
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:14,793
That's, you know, 20 cops
to the square mile, or whatever it is.

928
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,791
What's the response time?
Three minutes?

929
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:19,679
- Three minutes?
- What'd make you feel safe in there?

930
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:22,752
Fuck Beverly Hills.
Fuck those cops, man. They're just cops.

931
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:26,708
They can't be faster than three minutes.
Alarm goes off when we start sacking.

932
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:28,798
Let the alarm go.

933
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:31,474
Would you feel safe
for a minute and a half?

934
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:36,075
Bob. I gotta get out of here, man.

935
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:37,878
They're waiting on me.

936
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:42,238
Tell the old lady that owns the house
to sign this, not her mother, all right?

937
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,356
- All right.
- Right up.

938
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:47,398
You know next week
you don't have to do that?

939
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:50,598
- I wanna see you with nice clothes.
- How much longer you gonna be?

940
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:53,149
- Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.
- Okay.

941
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:56,392
Don't you wanna tan your face?
You wanna live in that neighborhood?

942
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:57,788
Don't you want a new car?

943
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,791
You're a thief.
Why don't you be a thief?

944
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,991
Did you like doing that bank?

945
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,873
Did you feel good doing that bank,
holding that shotgun?

946
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:12,033
- Did you feel good working with me?
- Yeah.

947
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:13,952
You wanna do it?

948
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:17,796
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

949
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:22,158
Yeah. What about a driver?

950
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,314
Mickey Barber, the other night,
introduced me to a guy.

951
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:33,152
I knew his brother.

952
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:36,955
He said he's a good wheelman.

953
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:51,357
- How you doing?
- Good.

954
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:55,156
- Jerry, Willy.
- Hey, man, I've heard a lot about you.

955
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:58,119
Here. I'll get it for you.

956
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:01,632
Watch your feet.

957
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:02,994
- Who is that guy?
- What?

958
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:04,639
- Is that the guy Mickey sent?
- No.

959
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:05,949
- No?
- It fell through.

960
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:08,873
- What do you mean?
- Did you get the plates changed?

961
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:12,430
The car is one half-hour hot and
the plates are changed. I did everything.

962
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:15,831
You should've told me. That was wrong.
Do you hear me? That was wrong.

963
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,549
- Where are we going?
- Keep going. We'll talk about it later.

964
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:30,274
- Right here?
- Go straight toward it.

965
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:33,637
All right. Now, you're gonna back in
that first spot there.

966
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:37,075
Go ahead. Take it easy.

967
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:44,319
Soon as you get in,
I'll tell you what we're doing.

968
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:48,315
- Oh, shit, I'm sorry.
- Take it easy, all right?

969
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:51,756
Okay, you see that door over there?
We'll be out in a few minutes.

970
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:55,071
As soon as we're out, open both doors.
We get in and split. You got it?

971
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:56,514
- Yeah.
- How do you feel?

972
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,591
- Do I keep the car running?
- Yeah. All right?

973
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,159
- I'm okay.
- You ready to hit it?

974
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:02,117
- Yeah.
- All right, let's go.

975
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:06,631
Just relax, man.

976
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:13,639
How do you feel?

977
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:15,791
Feel great. Except for that driver, man.

978
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:17,712
Don't worry about it.

979
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:21,510
- You should have told me about it.
- All right, let's do this.

980
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:24,237
- How's the vibes?
- Everything's all right.

981
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:27,915
- A lot of traffic, a lot of people.
- I'd kiss you, but you're too ugly.

982
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:38,236
No, it's too yellow. Thank you.

983
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:41,957
Well, may I see the 10 mm, please?

984
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:43,599
Yes.

985
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:49,752
Well, yes, I like the pink...

986
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:55,670
- I need a 24-carat ring.
- Well, we can order that. No problem.

987
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:58,395
What about...?

988
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,198
Pardon me. What are you doing?

989
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:02,590
Can you step back, please?

990
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:09,870
Do what you're told
and you won't get hurt.

991
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:11,996
Get up against the wall! Face the wall!

992
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:38,473
Sorry, sir. Will you step back in there
before you get shot?

993
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,312
- How do you feel?
- Go ahead, get some.

994
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:44,869
- We've got a minute and a half.
- Go on, there.

995
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:02,678
What's the time?

996
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:06,040
- What's the time?
- One minute.

997
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:14,514
Get it all.

998
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,591
Twenty seconds to go.

999
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:45,949
Let's go.

1000
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:50,869
- Let's go! Let's hit it.
- We've got time.

1001
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,395
Time's up! Let's go!

1002
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:59,229
Hey. Hey, let's go, man.

1003
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:02,194
Let's go, man.
We've gotta get out of here.

1004
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:04,159
There was another piece here.

1005
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:07,198
I don't believe this, man.
I really don't believe this.

1006
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:09,954
- There's gonna be an army out there.
- Where was it?

1007
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:12,031
- I don't know.
- There was a big piece here.

1008
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:18,513
This is the last goddamn time, man.
This is it.

1009
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:21,797
The poker game was the same way,
the driver, the whole goddamn thing.

1010
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:25,714
This is it. It's all over.

1011
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:29,999
You're a child, man. You act like
a 2-year-old child, for chrissake.

1012
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:32,193
I know you like a book.

1013
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:35,557
This is the last goddamn time
I'm working with you. I mean it.

1014
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:38,958
What are you...? Get over there
and sit down! Put your head down.

1015
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:40,838
- What are you doing?
- Where's the watch?

1016
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,991
Hey, we gotta get out of here, man!

1017
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:48,238
Hey! Hey!

1018
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:51,836
- Listen to me! Listen to me.
- Let go of that. All right, all right!

1019
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,991
Give it to me, man.

1020
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:58,117
- We're going.
- Why don't you take a clock too?

1021
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:01,192
This is the last goddamn time
I'm working with you.

1022
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:09,314
- Where is he?
- Yeah, where is he?

1023
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:13,474
Where is he?
Was this part of your goddamn plan?

1024
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:19,515
Who the fuck knows where he is?

1025
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:22,909
You're pathetic.
You're a pathetic fucking human being.

1026
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:25,594
We gotta run. We gotta run.
We gotta run.

1027
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,996
Get rid of the shotgun!

1028
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:42,519
Walk, walk, walk.
Slow down and walk. Walk.

1029
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:45,754
- Come on.
- Are we going the right way?

1030
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:48,628
The car's on the next street.
Come on, we're all right.

1031
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:10,158
Halt! Police!

1032
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:24,791
- It's a great line.
- We gotta go. Right now. Come on.

1033
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:31,550
Excuse me, could you
see this guy for me?

1034
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:33,631
- Where's your car?
- In the back.

1035
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:35,358
- Where? Let's go.
- In the back.

1036
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:38,910
So I'll be back in a second.
What's the matter?

1037
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:49,239
- Where's your key? Where's your car?
- Keep going. It's over there.

1038
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:52,549
- Give me the key.
- Just a sec.

1039
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:55,393
- Where are we going?
- Come on.

1040
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:06,519
- What happened?
- I'll tell you later.

1041
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:11,596
What are you doing?

1042
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,590
Max, please.

1043
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:23,874
I gotta stop by and get some money
from a friend.

1044
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:12,117
Where are you, man? Willy?

1045
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:21,232
Shit.

1046
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:26,952
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1047
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:29,475
I'll fucking hurt your fucking ass.

1048
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:34,151
Don't tell me "wait." I'm gonna put
your fucking brains on that wall!

1049
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:37,198
- Let me explain.
- You knew I'd be back, didn't you?

1050
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:40,360
Please let me explain to you
what happened.

1051
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:47,634
Go ahead, run it.

1052
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:50,953
I had the car pointed the right way.

1053
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:53,156
The motor was on.

1054
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,830
I was watching my clock,
I was watching the door.

1055
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:58,116
The burglar alarm went off
for five minutes.

1056
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:00,077
That's bullshit, man.

1057
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:03,116
That's bullshit, man.

1058
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:08,593
- Max...
- No, no. No, man, I would've been there.

1059
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,752
I'm running because of you,
sucker man.

1060
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:13,434
That shit under the bed?
I went to jail because of you.

1061
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:16,353
I'm sorry.

1062
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:20,031
Well, you know, sorry ain't shit now.
You know why?

1063
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:23,151
It don't mean nothing.

1064
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:25,353
Come on, Max.

1065
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:28,714
- Are you high?
- No.

1066
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:31,269
- Did you get high?
- No.

1067
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:35,431
Then I don't understand
why you don't hear me.

1068
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:38,592
I don't understand why you don't
understand what I'm talking about.

1069
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:39,954
Jerry's dead.

1070
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:42,670
Just lying on the street, man.

1071
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:45,753
And that hurts me, man,
because he'd do anything for me.

1072
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:48,036
He'd do anything for me.

1073
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:50,551
If he was out in the car, man...

1074
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:52,790
...there could have been a shitstorm,
you know?

1075
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:01,631
Max, I'm sorry.

1076
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:08,237
I got scared.

1077
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:11,951
I'm scared now.

1078
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:15,875
You did the best you could, right?

1079
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:20,357
- I really did.
- I gave you every chance, too, didn't I?

1080
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:23,070
It wasn't your fault.

1081
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:25,952
It's over, Willy.

1082
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:33,638
It's over, man. Forget it.
I shouldn't have asked you to do it.

1083
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:35,711
It was too heavy for you.

1084
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:39,710
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right. It's all right, man.

1085
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:42,633
- What can I do?
- Give me a big bear hug...

1086
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:45,274
...and just forget it.
- Okay.

1087
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:46,754
I'm sorry.

1088
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:49,514
- You were wrong, though, you know.
- I know it.

1089
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:51,557
I'm sorry.

1090
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,513
Shit.

1091
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:45,912
Did you get it?

1092
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:47,433
- What?
- The money.

1093
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:48,874
Yeah.

1094
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:54,878
Where's the freeway?

1095
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:56,678
I don't know.

1096
01:38:58,080 --> 01:38:59,718
Well, we're going.

1097
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:02,993
- All right?
- Let's go. Yeah, let's go.

1098
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:43,518
How you doing?

1099
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:48,355
- Want me to drive?
- No, I'm all right. Can I have one?

1100
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:01,152
<i>- This afternoon when a house trailer</i>

1101
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:04,118

1117
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:04,830
We didn't start the shooting.

1118
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:16,357
- Would you pull over for a second?
- Why?

1119
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:18,192
Please pull over. I don't feel well.

1120
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:22,114
- Wait'll we get to a gas station, will you?
- I can't wait, Max.

1121
01:41:25,160 --> 01:41:28,038
Pull the fucking car over, goddamn it!

1122
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:31,752
Max, don't you dare lay
a fucking hand on me!

1123
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:12,673
- What do you wanna do with this?
- I got it.

1124
01:42:15,080 --> 01:42:17,230
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

1125
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:21,030
Fill it up with regular and you better
check the oil. I think that's all.

1126
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:36,433
- Want something to drink?
- Yeah.

1127
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:39,353
Just get me a ginger ale.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

1128
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:44,470
- Give us a ginger ale and a beer?
- What kind of beer?

1129
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:46,756
- It doesn't matter. We'll be over here.
- Yeah. Anyway...

1130
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:49,957
...he starts back to her at the door
and I think he's not gonna say anything.

1131
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:52,395
And he looks up at me
with the football helmet...

1132
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:56,189
...and he says, "Lady,
I sure hope your team wins."

1133
01:43:20,240 --> 01:43:23,869
- Here we are, sir. Here you go.
- Thank you.

1134
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:26,918
- And can I get you something else?
- No, that's okay.

1135
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:29,116
I got some fine
homemade chili for you.

1136
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:32,875
- This'll do it.
- All right. That'll be 90 cents.

1137
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:35,076
I saw a sign outside.
Is there a bus stop here?

1138
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:37,800
Yeah. That would be
the local Palmdale transportation.

1139
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:39,188
It stops twice a day.

1140
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:44,115
The schedule's kind of irregular, but...
Where were you going?

1141
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:48,908
- Where you kids going, honey?
- L.A.

1142
01:43:49,880 --> 01:43:54,954
Oh, L.A. You take the Palmdale bus from
here, as I say, and go into Palmdale.

1143
01:43:55,120 --> 01:43:58,430
- Make your connection to L.A. There.
- What time does it get here?

1144
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:00,591
You got about half an hour.

1145
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:02,113
- I'll get your change.
- Keep it.

1146
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:04,350
Oh, thanks, yeah.

1147
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,991
You sending me home?

1148
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:18,591
Yeah, you are.

1149
01:44:30,280 --> 01:44:32,714
Please, Max, I don't want any money.

1150
01:44:35,320 --> 01:44:37,117
I want you to have it.

1151
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:51,152
What are you gonna do?

1152
01:44:58,640 --> 01:45:00,471
Will you call me?

1153
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:21,633
Gotta go.

1154
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:50,277
Forgot my sweater.

1155
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:55,598
Why can't I go with you?

1156
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:59,077
Because I wanna get caught.

1157
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:22,951
