1
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:33,788
Daddy, it's 7:30!

2
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,459
Daddy, it's 7:30.

3
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,501
Daddy, wake up!

4
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,602
Morning, Daddy.
Come on, wake up.

5
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,965
Wake up. Come on, wake up.

6
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,041
There's your coffee, right there.

7
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,636
Oh, where am I?

8
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,239
Here, I want you to drink this.

9
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,851
Then I want you to take a shower.
Then I want you to get dressed.

10
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:00,977
There are your clothes, right there.

11
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,249
And then I want you to go to see
the woman about the job, okay?

12
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,257
- Today, you promised.
- I know.

13
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,919
What would I do without you
nagging me all the time?

14
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:10,121
You really want me to answer that?

15
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,228
God, I've been getting in
kind of late lately.

16
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,495
We haven't had a chance to talk
or anything.

17
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,129
Oh, don't worry about it.
There hasn't been a lot to say.

18
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:22,300
- Is everything all right with you?
- Yeah.

19
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:26,839
- Is school good?
- No, but it never is.

20
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:29,575
- Have you been asked to the prom?
- No.

21
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,415
Not yet.

22
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,778
When was the last time I told you
how beautiful you are?

23
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,717
About yesterday.

24
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:40,287
- Hey, hey, turn around.
- What?

25
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,893
You know what.
Come here, let me see this outfit.

26
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:46,557
- And is this your latest creation?
- This is it.

27
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,725
My God, what did that cost you?

28
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:53,096
Oh, about $15 for the shoes,
secondhand, and I made the rest.

29
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,838
Unbelievable.

30
00:02:57,076 --> 00:03:00,978
I was thinking maybe
that you could do something with this.

31
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:04,414
- Maybe put some ruffles up here.
- Come on, get up! No, really, I mean it.

32
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,145
This means a lot to me.

33
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,010
Honey, I'm perfectly happy
with what I'm doing.

34
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:11,579
You're perfectly happy
with part-time work?

35
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,259
No, that's why I'm getting up.

36
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,319
Okay. I'll make you some breakfast.

37
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,297
I'm up!

38
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,967
- Hi, Blane.
- Hi, Kate. How you doing?

39
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,764
- Fine. How are you?
- Good.

40
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:10,873
Good morning!

41
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,850
Welcome to another day
of higher education.

42
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,250
Hi, Duckie. How are you?

43
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,346
Not all that bad,
considering I'm in this dump.

44
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,282
You know, this is a really
volcanic ensemble you're wearing.

45
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,419
It's really marvelous.

46
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,759
- Volcanic?
- Well, you know, hot, dangerous.

47
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,128
Are you gonna go to class today?

48
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,633
Well, I don't know
if I'm emotionally ready.

49
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:31,636
- Oh, go for it. It's virtually painless.
- Excuse me.

50
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,734
- I gotta go, okay? I'll see you at lunch.
- Okay, well, listen,

51
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:37,742
I'll call ahead to the cafeteria
and make a couple of reservations.

52
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,368
- You know, two by the window.
- Sure.

53
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,107
Well, no. You don't like to sit in the sun.
Okay, something else.

54
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,581
Listen, may I admire you again today?

55
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,791
Ladies, ladies, listen,
I may be able to work out a deal

56
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,658
where either one or the both of you
could be pregnant by the holidays.

57
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,094
What do you say?

58
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:06,100
Some argue that the New Deal
saved the capitalist system.

59
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,834
And as evidence
that the Roosevelt administration

60
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:12,901
was trying to avoid
excessive governmental power

61
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,871
rather than implant socialism,

62
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:19,941
in his first act as President,
Mr. Roosevelt enacted

63
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,680
the Emergency Banking Act,

64
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:24,245
and he refused
to consider nationalization.

65
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,993
Where'd you get your clothes,
five-and-dime store?

66
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,660
Attractive.

67
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,565
Is there a problem, ladies?

68
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,239
- No.
- No.

69
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:47,104
Andie, is there something going on
between you and these ladies?

70
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:49,178
No, not that I'm aware of.

71
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:55,348
I'd like to apologize on behalf
of Miss Trombley and Miss Hanson.

72
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,781
These two young ladies will be thinking
of you tonight

73
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:01,384
as they write a summary of the chapters
that we've just covered.

74
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:04,455
Great.

75
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:10,058
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

76
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,972
There's nothing wrong with me.
I mean, I'm fine.

77
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,338
Can you just forget about the chapter?

78
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:20,642
Yes?

79
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,340
We'll take the chapter.

80
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:24,473
Fine, let's go on.

81
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,916
The Emergency Banking Act.

82
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,019
I'll see you guys later.

83
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:34,389
- Hey, see ya.
- Bye.

84
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,519
Oh, Andie, you look ravishing.

85
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:40,131
So we graduate in a month.
Now, I want to know when it is

86
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,190
that you and I are gonna get together
and do something.

87
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:43,565
Try never.

88
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:46,104
Well, I'm talking about
more than sex here.

89
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,196
No, you're not.

90
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:50,800
You know, I've liked you for four years,
and you treat me like shit, you know.

91
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,368
I don't understand that.
What's your problem?

92
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,437
Can you get off of my car?

93
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:00,652
You know, I've been out
with a lot of girls at this school.

94
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,517
I don't see what makes you so different.

95
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,317
I have some taste.

96
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,248
You're a bitch.

97
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,054
You know,
I think you ought to see a doctor,

98
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,224
'cause that condition of yours
could get a lot worse.

99
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:48,266
Applause, applause, applause.

100
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,668
This is beautiful.

101
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,668
It's so modern.

102
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,341
I mean, is this fab, or what?

103
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,809
It's great.

104
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:03,043
- I'm very, very good at this.
- I know.

105
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:07,986
Such a waste that I run
a lowly little retail outlet.

106
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:09,948
No, not if you're good at it.

107
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:12,286
I'm good in bed. Should I be a whore?

108
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:18,421
It's great.

109
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,134
Did you say that you went to your prom?

110
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,601
Yeah, sure.

111
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:28,537
- Was it terrible?
- It was the worst.

112
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,132
But it's supposed to be,
you know what I mean?

113
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,234
But you have to go, right?

114
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:35,280
Well, you don't have to.
I mean, it's not a requirement.

115
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,111
I have this girlfriend
who didn't go to hers,

116
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,118
and every once in a while she gets
this really terrible feeling, you know,

117
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,517
like something is missing.

118
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:44,021
She checks her purse, you know,
she checks her keys,

119
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,888
she counts her kids, she goes crazy,
and then she realizes

120
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,395
that nothing is missing.

121
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,588
She decided it was side effects
from skipping the prom.

122
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:58,429
I don't know. I mean, part of me says
just go and get it over with.

123
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:01,029
And this other part of me says
it's a stupid tradition

124
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,301
and what's the point?

125
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,778
Well, you know,
you could say that life itself

126
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,641
is a stupid tradition.

127
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:14,248
But don't analyze it, just go.

128
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:19,719
Put that back!

129
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:25,661
- You missed my eye by an inch!
- Half an inch.

130
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:30,162
This ain't the public library, light fingers!

131
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:57,652
I'll get it.

132
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,764
Trax, what do you want?

133
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:08,165
Tyrone, you blow.

134
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:11,341
Yeah, I'm working. Leave me alone.

135
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,939
That's thrilling!

136
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:19,315
I cook for you, I do your laundry,

137
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:22,252
I sleep with you,
now you want a ride to work.

138
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,581
Please grow up!

139
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,992
Take the bus.

140
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,054
Take a cab.

141
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,463
- How you doing?
- Fine.

142
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:35,557
Good.

143
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,001
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. Yeah.

144
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,470
Can I get your opinion
on something here?

145
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,766
Maybe.

146
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,364
Maybe.

147
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,544
This any good?

148
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,773
Sticks and stones, Tyrone.

149
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,046
- It's hot. White hot.
- Sticks and stones.

150
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:56,978
Good, I'll take it.

151
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,851
Okay. Will that be cash or charge?

152
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:04,555
American Express Platinum Card,
maybe?

153
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:06,821
Take a bus to the zoo!

154
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,161
Cash.

155
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:09,423
You know,

156
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:13,736
every time you go to the john,
you lose IQ points.

157
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,109
It's Walter Mondale.

158
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:22,671
- And just $7.50 is your change.
- Thanks.

159
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:25,080
Tyrone, no.

160
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,815
- I don't need a bag.
- No?

161
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:28,876
No.

162
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,052
I can't do these things for you.

163
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,852
- Thanks. Thanks.
- Enjoy it.

164
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:37,560
Bondage has no place in my life.

165
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,097
Since when?

166
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,831
Since I spent the night tied up
in the backseat of your car!

167
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,311
- Jena?
- Yeah.

168
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:33,840
Would you ever consider going out
with somebody that had money?

169
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:41,224
I don't think it makes a difference.
I mean, it's material.

170
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,830
Simon? Simon.

171
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:51,035
What would you do
if your father came home a rich man?

172
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,365
Kiss his ass.

173
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,963
- See?
- See what?

174
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,600
- What Simon just said.
- What...

175
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:00,704
Andie, what are you getting at?

176
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,805
Are you... Are you going out
with a rich guy or something?

177
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,213
- I gotta go.
- Hey, wait! Wait!

178
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,444
- You didn't answer my question.
- No.

179
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:09,418
- Good.
- Simon, it's been stimulating.

180
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,921
- How long I been coming here?
- I don't know, a couple years.

181
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,224
Okay, so, you know, we're buddies.
We're close, right?

182
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,763
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Very, pal.

183
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,698
Okay, so how many times
have you let me in?

184
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:23,325
I never let you in, you know that.

185
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:26,337
- So you see what I'm saying?
- I don't know. What are you saying?

186
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,771
What I'm saying is
my girlfriend is in there,

187
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:29,899
and I'm out here.

188
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:33,536
Well, she's a girl and she's my friend,
so she's a girlfriend.

189
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:34,909
But she's in there, and I'm out here!

190
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,540
I mean, you're a sensitive,
sexually potent kind of guy.

191
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,311
You gotta know how that hurts.

192
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,649
Now let me ask you a question,
seriously.

193
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,754
Why does she come here,
knowing I don't let you in?

194
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,155
- Huh? Think about it.
- I don't know.

195
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:53,795
All right, my advice to you is dump her.

196
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:56,096
Lose her. You don't need that.

197
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:59,569
You see what I'm saying?
You see the point I'm trying to make?

198
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:03,531
Love's a bitch, Duck. Love's a bitch.

199
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,134
- Ain't it the truth.
- Oh, it's the truth.

200
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,906
- High-five.
- All right.

201
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,969
Go for it.

202
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,613
You wanna try a cigarette? Come on.

203
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,174
Oh, the babe, the babe, the babe.

204
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,243
Hey, honey, honey,
let me ask you a personal question.

205
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:18,586
If you worship the Duck, why don't you
hang out somewhere he could get in?

206
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:19,851
Good night, Dice Man!

207
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:22,485
Hey, say hello to the wife and kids,
you know what I'm saying?

208
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:23,619
Yeah.

209
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,687
You see, the Dice Man is dyslexic.
He gets everything backwards.

210
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,664
- What he meant to say was, like, if I...
- It's okay, Duckie.

211
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,530
Oh, okay. 'Cause you're sure?
Because if he offended you,

212
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,399
I would gladly clean up this parking lot
with his butt.

213
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,631
- No, I'm fine. Don't worry about it.
- Okay. Okay.

214
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,937
- Were you here long?
- No, no. Three, four hours.

215
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,601
You have a good time, at least?

216
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:41,145
- Oh, good, that's good. Now, what now?
- Bed.

217
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:45,547
- Yours or mine? Ours?
- Nice try.

218
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:46,642
Okay.

219
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,017
- Can you at least give me a ride home?
- Yeah, get in.

220
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,953
Can I, like, put my head in your lap?

221
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,994
No, wait, can I rest my head
on your shoulder and let you steer?

222
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,256
- Get in, Duckie.
- Okay.

223
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,761
These houses are amazing, Duck.

224
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:08,368
Hey, the first million I make,
I buy you one.

225
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,805
I hate this song.

226
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,672
They're so beautiful.

227
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,212
Hey, you want beauty, look in the mirror.

228
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,339
This whole tape is horrible.

229
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,080
I must be going through, like,
a hormone thing,

230
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:21,016
'cause every song I listen to
is making me sick.

231
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,577
I mean, why can't I find
a decent song here?

232
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,589
- That one's my favorite.
- Are you deaf?

233
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,022
The house.

234
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:34,489
Oh, yeah, yeah. That's a nice little crib.

235
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,700
I wonder what it's like inside.

236
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,963
Well, what difference does it make?

237
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,737
You know what
the really sad thing is though?

238
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:46,107
I bet the people that live there
don't think it's half as pretty as I do.

239
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,840
- You know what I mean?
- You know, Andie, I'm just...

240
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,814
They just don't write love songs
like they used to.

241
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,214
It's... I'm...

242
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,047
I'm angry about this, you know?

243
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,144
My evening's shot.

244
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:57,882
Just drive me home, now.

245
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:23,397
Hey.

246
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,777
Well, the reason I came over,

247
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:31,179
I mean, other than I'd been planning
to come by and just say hello,

248
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,185
I wanted to talk to you about Andie.

249
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:37,051
- Yeah.
- I mean, she's an incredible individual.

250
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,817
I mean, you know that.
I mean, I'm there for her!

251
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,189
Whenever, however, I'm there.

252
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,421
You can rest assured
that she's covered.

253
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:46,362
I don't want you to worry,
because my only future plans are

254
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,263
to make sure that she's taken care of.

255
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,528
That's nice of you, Phil.

256
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,862
And I'd like to marry her.

257
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:57,297
Oh, well, not, you know, not today,
but eventually, I figure.

258
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,944
Well, does Andie know
how you feel about this?

259
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,706
No confirmation on that just yet.

260
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,773
I mean, I'm laying the groundwork
and everything, you know.

261
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,580
I'm thinking in terms of housing,
you know, food,

262
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,052
basic needs type of stuff.

263
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,316
But I'm picking my moment.

264
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,956
Yeah, I mean, you understand, right?

265
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:18,520
Oh, sure. I felt the same way
about somebody myself.

266
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,760
- Oh, a girl?
- A girl.

267
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,128
I loved her and I married her.

268
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,838
And one day she just split.

269
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,377
Oh, wait. This was Andie's mom?

270
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,369
- Yeah.
- Oh.

271
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:41,648
So I haven't seen her in three years,
you know, and...

272
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,449
But I still love her

273
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:47,288
just as much as I ever did, you know.

274
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:50,360
I mean, you can love Andie,

275
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,363
but that doesn't mean
she's gonna love you back.

276
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,956
I mean, it doesn't mean that she won't,

277
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:58,699
but what I'm trying to say is
you can't make it happen, you know?

278
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:02,262
It either will or it won't.
It's all in the heart.

279
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,605
Oh, yeah, sure, I... Cardiovascular.

280
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:08,669
Yeah, I understand. I've been to school.

281
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,070
Yeah.

282
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:14,115
Well, I got an appointment
with a vacuum cleaner. Gotta go.

283
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:17,147
Hey, you're on a whole
home improvement jag here, aren't you?

284
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:19,452
Yeah. Turning the old life around.

285
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:20,992
Oh, well, hey, more power to you.

286
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,755
If Tina Turner can do it,
Jack Walsh can do it, too.

287
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:27,993
Well, thanks for taking your time.
I really, you know... I appreciate it.

288
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,762
- My pleasure.
- I'm off like a dirty shirt.

289
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,329
Tina Turner.

290
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,016
Hiya.

291
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,953
We just got these glasses in.

292
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,859
- They're really
- Yeah, I didn't like that album I got

293
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,988
- the other day.
...dumb.

294
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:00,395
- What?
- What?

295
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,060
- The record.
- Oh, the record.

296
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:06,901
- Yeah, I thought it was a little too...
- Too hip, maybe?

297
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,138
Yeah, a little too hip.

298
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,968
Well...

299
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:16,240
Think you can recommend something
else a little less political, or something?

300
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,783
- Lionel Richie?
- Nah.

301
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:25,556
No, well, Teena Marie, Madonna?

302
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:26,613
Madonna?

303
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,523
- Yeah, Madonna.
- That's awfully deep.

304
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:32,030
Yeah, very deep,
but she's got such great style.

305
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,590
Yeah, listen...

306
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,132
That's the alarm.

307
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:38,430
- Can you hold on for a second?
- Sure.

308
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,164
Just... I'll be right back.

309
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:42,499
Here, read this.

310
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,565
It's really good. Don't lose my...
No, no, no, you can use my...

311
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:45,667
Hold on.

312
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,777
What is this?

313
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,041
Hi! How's your day?

314
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,020
Baby pumps out
about 300 decibels, huh?

315
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:59,351
- Did you do this?
- Well, I'm not sure.

316
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,449
I mean,
I was just using your powder room,

317
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:02,823
and I decided not to disturb you,

318
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:04,555
so I was going to go out the back door.

319
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,359
But I guess
I must've touched something.

320
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,625
How'd you get in here?

321
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,291
- Are you mad?
- Yes, I'm mad.

322
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:11,563
There are public bathrooms
all over the place!

323
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,162
I'm not nine, Andie. I know that.

324
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,833
It's just, it's the end of the month.
They're out of toilet-seat covers.

325
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:21,440
You know what a stickler I am
about personal hygiene, too.

326
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,579
That's ridiculous, Duckie. Why don't you
just stop making excuses?

327
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:26,982
Blane, what are you doing?

328
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:29,452
Hey, buddy, what's up?
Nothing, hanging out.

329
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:32,285
Well, what are you shopping for,
records or something?

330
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:33,346
I guess.

331
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:36,292
- Did you find anything?
- No, not really. Not really.

332
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:38,124
Well, are we gonna shoot some trap,
or what?

333
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,096
'Cause, I mean, if we're gonna shoot,
we gotta shake it, man.

334
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:43,862
I don't have anyplace to go. I like
coming here, excuse me very much.

335
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,334
It's okay.
I'm sorry for getting mad at you.

336
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:48,339
I gotta get back out in front, okay?
I'll see you later.

337
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,247
This is a shitty alarm system.

338
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,810
I had to open and close the door
five times before it rang!

339
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,686
That's it, I'm leaving.
I'm not gonna stay here!

340
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:06,985
No, no way!

341
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,117
Hi, it's 6:05, Duckie Dale.
Give me a call.

342
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:41,719
6:15, Duckie Dale again. Call me, okay?

343
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:47,488
Andie, where are you? This is the Duck.
Give me a call, okay?

344
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:51,630
It's 6:28.

345
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:55,330
Please call, please, please, please.

346
00:22:56,942 --> 00:23:00,070
This is Duckie. Are you really home
and just not picking up?

347
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:02,443
'Cause if so,
I feel like a giant asshole here.

348
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:04,539
It's 6:31. Give me a call, okay, please?

349
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,509
Andie, this is Steve.

350
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:12,716
Duckie, I'll just talk to you
in the morning, okay? Bye.

351
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:51,787
What are you doing up?
I didn't wake you up yet.

352
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:53,262
Well, I'm fixing you breakfast.

353
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:55,731
One egg, over-medium,
and I fed the dog.

354
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,496
Did Daddy feed you?

355
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:00,094
- Your egg, Madame.
- Oh, I don't eat eggs, Daddy.

356
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:01,298
Here, why don't you go in and eat it?

357
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,341
I'll bring you your coffee and juice,
okay?

358
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:04,432
Okay.

359
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,304
Since when don't you like eggs?

360
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:10,109
Oh, since about birth.
Don't worry about it.

361
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:12,540
Hey,
you never told me why you were up.

362
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,948
Well, it's morning.

363
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:17,951
Oh, you mean, why didn't you have
to drag my ass out of bed?

364
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,115
Okay.

365
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,715
Well, I got a job.

366
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,984
- No.
- Yeah.

367
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,021
Where?

368
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,593
Well, I'll tell you after I start.

369
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:33,697
- When's that?
- Soon.

370
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:37,339
I'm so proud of you! You got the job.

371
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,843
- No big deal.
- Yes, it is a big deal.

372
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:41,538
It's a very big deal.

373
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:44,081
Listen, I gotta go, okay?
I'm gonna be late for school.

374
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,117
You tell me all about it tonight.
I'm so proud of you.

375
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:48,118
All right, it'll be real good.

376
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:13,871
Hi, guys.

377
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:19,516
- How you doing?
- Fine.

378
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:21,347
- You?
- Okay.

379
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:24,718
- And you?
- Well, I just said I was fine.

380
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:27,087
- Oh, yeah, sorry.
- No, it's okay.

381
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:32,023
- So is this your first time out here?
- Yeah.

382
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,222
I don't think I'm very popular
out here, either.

383
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,633
Oh, I don't know. You're just fine inside.

384
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:40,632
I don't know.

385
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:43,002
I'm not really into all this shit,
you know?

386
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:44,063
Yeah.

387
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:46,466
Yeah.

388
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:52,749
Oh, I really liked your computer trick.

389
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:56,578
- Clever, huh?
- Terribly clever, yeah, terribly.

390
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:04,627
- Are you late for something?
- Yeah, I am, as a matter of fact.

391
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,629
But, I mean,
it's no big deal. It's fine.

392
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,763
Listen, do you wanna...
Do you wanna go out Friday?

393
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:13,934
Yeah.

394
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:16,538
- Yeah?
- Sure.

395
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:18,165
- Yeah. Okay.
- Sure.

396
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,609
- 7:00, okay?
- Yeah, that's fine.

397
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:23,979
Great, great. Well, where do you live?
I'll pick you up.

398
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:29,018
- Where do you live?
- Oh, no, I'm sorry.

399
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:32,420
I'm gonna be working on Friday,
so you can just pick me up at the mall.

400
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:33,548
- Okay.
- Okay?

401
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,684
- Bye.
- See you.

402
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:50,766
Hey, Blane. How you doing?

403
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,841
Hey, buddy, what's up?

404
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,879
- What are you up to?
- Oh, not much. Going to class.

405
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,711
- Well, I saw you outside.
- So?

406
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:00,946
So what were you doing?

407
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,816
What are you, my mother?

408
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,222
Come on, I gotta go. I'll see you later.

409
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,155
- Blane, what's going on?
- Nothing.

410
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:10,058
Well, not nothing.
I mean, I saw you talking to that chick.

411
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,323
What's her name? Eddie or something.

412
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,658
So what do you care?

413
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:16,223
Listen, my best friend is conversing
with a mutant,

414
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,290
you know, and I'm curious.

415
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,894
I don't think that's any reason
to get defensive.

416
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,370
I'm not defensive.

417
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:23,264
I just happen to like her, all right?

418
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:27,209
Listen, all right, it's, you know,
it's your life. It's none of my business.

419
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:29,303
You really don't think
she's got something?

420
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,005
No.

421
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:33,817
I really don't, I'm sorry.

422
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:37,350
You're gonna be late, buddy.

423
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:49,297
Okay, the Warsaw Pact is a treaty
that was signed by the Soviet Union

424
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,494
and its seven East European
satellites, okay?

425
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:53,298
And what it did was it...

426
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:56,067
It established a mutual
defense organization

427
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:57,130
as a counterweight to NATO.

428
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:59,733
- Duckie.
- What? What? What? What?

429
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:01,908
Well, what did I put?

430
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:06,547
You wrote, "The Warsaw Pact is
the pact that's named after Warsaw."

431
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,854
So a teacher's just gonna know
that you're just bullshitting.

432
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:13,220
Okay, okay. What about the rest of it?

433
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:17,019
Well, the Russian Revolution did not
take place in Germany.

434
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,526
- Well, what was Karl Marx then?
- He was a German.

435
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:22,065
Well, there you go.

436
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:24,693
Yes, but his being German
doesn't have anything to do

437
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:27,169
with where
the Russian Revolution occurred.

438
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:29,263
Okay, okay.

439
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:33,544
Okay, Duckie,
can I propose something to you

440
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:35,272
without you getting upset or angry?

441
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:38,076
- Well, that depends.
- On what?

442
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:41,276
I don't know, I just said that. Go ahead.

443
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,950
Well, I propose that you're deliberately
flunking your courses

444
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:45,990
so that you can stay in high school.

445
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,548
Get out of here! Why would I do that?

446
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:49,923
I don't know, you tell me.

447
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:52,895
Well, I'm not, so there's nothing to tell.

448
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,062
Well, you know,
you're not always one to face things.

449
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,191
What? Since when?

450
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:58,565
- What am I not facing?
- The future.

451
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:02,231
Well, whether or not you face the future,
it happens, right?

452
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,272
You run yourself down.
Why do you do that?

453
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,742
I am not running myself down.
You think I'm running...

454
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:08,403
I don't think I'm running myself down.

455
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,675
Why? Because of the way I dress?

456
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:11,807
'Cause I can laugh at myself?

457
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:15,478
That's called a sense of humor.
You should get one, they're nice.

458
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:17,715
What are we gonna do next year?

459
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,689
Well, according to you,
I'll still be in high school.

460
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,816
No, I'm serious.

461
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:22,985
I mean, not a day has passed in, what,
eight years

462
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:26,189
when I didn't see you
or talk to you at least 20 times.

463
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:27,889
Well, that's devotion.

464
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,897
I know,
and even though I sometimes get angry,

465
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,663
you know that I secretly love it.

466
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:33,431
You see, I knew that.

467
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:36,470
You know,
I hope I'm not the only one in the world

468
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,338
that knows what an incredible person
you are.

469
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:41,537
Well, at this point in time,
I'm afraid you are, honey.

470
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:46,112
Okay, I'm gonna get something to drink,
and then we work, okay? You promise?

471
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:48,516
- Oh, you bet.
- Okay, what do you want?

472
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,051
- Oh, beer, Scotch, juice box, whatever.
- Okay.

473
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,659
Oh, God.

474
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:01,725
I love this woman.

475
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,561
I love this woman, and I have to tell her.

476
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:08,567
And if she laughs, she laughs.

477
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,633
And if she doesn't love me,
she doesn't love me.

478
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:16,077
But if I don't find out...

479
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:18,941
Oh, I love her too much.

480
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:28,017
Love is real

481
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,950
Thank you, thank you.

482
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:33,293
Real is love

483
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:35,924
You're a wonderful crowd here,
you know that.

484
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:38,262
Love is living

485
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:44,230
You're fabulous. I do love you.
I do love you. You're gorgeous.

486
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:45,469
I love your hair.

487
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:48,273
Love is feeling

488
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:52,215
Feeling love

489
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:56,247
Love is wanting

490
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,980
She's gonna laugh.

491
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:04,526
Would I blame her?

492
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:07,364
- Here you go.
- Oh, shit.

493
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:08,797
Listen, honey, thanks,
but I'm gonna split, you know.

494
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,562
Why? What about your paper?

495
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:12,626
That's what I'm gonna do,
you see, 'cause...

496
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,070
I mean, if you help me,
thanks a lot, but it'll...

497
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,004
It won't be my work. It'll be bogus.

498
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:19,703
And you know,
I guess I'll see you in the a.m.

499
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,079
Hey, drinking and driving don't mix.

500
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:25,274
That's why I ride a bike.

501
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:37,728
- I got it.
- Over here.

502
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,588
Get it!

503
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:47,066
So, what's the deal?
Are you going out this weekend?

504
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:49,129
I don't know. I'm not sure yet.

505
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,499
- Why? What are you gonna do?
- Stay at home.

506
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,067
- Yeah, you gonna study again?
- Probably.

507
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:55,942
- Would you put that out?
- No.

508
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:58,107
Well, you study so much,
it makes me ill.

509
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:00,582
- I just don't see the point.
- You don't?

510
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:02,449
I don't wanna work in a record store
my whole life.

511
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,647
Yeah, what do you wanna be, a doctor?

512
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:07,647
Oh, God. Here we go.

513
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,218
Okay, let's go, everybody.
Get in your lines, please. Thank you.

514
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,831
- Fulmeister.
- Here!

515
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,593
Besset!

516
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:19,702
- Basono!
- Yeah.

517
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,671
- Look at that girl's shoes.
- Goulong!

518
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:23,730
- Oh, look. Watch out.
- Yorkland!

519
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:26,837
- Deeds!
- Do we smell bad or something?

520
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:28,936
- Hey, Benny.
- Fox!

521
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:31,942
- Penfield!
- I hope they shrivel up and fall off, okay?

522
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:35,580
What was that, Miss Hoeman?

523
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:41,086
I said, I hope they shrivel up and fall off.

524
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,760
You hope what shrivels up and falls off?

525
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,594
Her breasts, Miss Dietz.

526
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:49,394
- Shut up!
- I'm sorry.

527
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:54,104
- You are out of here, Hoeman.
- Right.

528
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:57,169
Bye-bye. Bye, girls.

529
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,308
So, do you share
your partner's attitude?

530
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,451
No, I don't.

531
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,488
Eat shit.

532
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,386
Excuse me, Miss Dietz.

533
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,793
You've only got a couple of months left.

534
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:23,595
You're doing extremely well
in your courses,

535
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:27,565
and I think your chances of getting
a scholarship are excellent.

536
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:29,367
I know this, Mr. Donnelly.

537
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,870
- Why are you in here now?
- I don't know.

538
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:34,104
I guess I just got a little fed up.

539
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:37,579
- With what?
- The way that we get treated.

540
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,478
Look,

541
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:44,017
you're getting
a top-notch education here,

542
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:47,285
and I just don't wanna see
you throw it away.

543
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,452
I'm getting a better education
than I deserve. I'm lucky.

544
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,393
I'm fortunate that the good people
of this community

545
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:53,862
allow me to attend this school.

546
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:55,990
Again, you are misunderstanding me.

547
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:57,898
No, I understand everything,
Mr. Donnelly.

548
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:01,427
I don't need to have it explained to me.
I live it.

549
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:05,406
It's just sometimes I get a little upset,
and I lose my temper.

550
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,773
I just don't like to see my friends
getting dumped on

551
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:10,143
or punished for defending themselves.

552
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:16,379
Well, we'll just forget about
this whole thing, okay?

553
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,121
Okay.

554
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:24,953
- What about Jena?
- She's off, too.

555
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:27,294
Thank you.

556
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,358
Andie,

557
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:33,661
if you put out signals
that you don't want to belong,

558
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:36,439
people are gonna make sure
that you don't.

559
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:38,837
That's a beautiful theory.

560
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:43,341
Andie, Andie, Andie, listen,
I heard what happened,

561
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,006
and I came as fast as I could.

562
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,778
I cut out of Home Ec and everything.

563
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,478
- Was it really bad?
- No, it was nothing, Duckie.

564
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:50,077
- Are you upset?
- No, I'm not.

565
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:51,143
No, yes, yes, you are.

566
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:53,247
I can tell.
Your eyes get all squinty and everything.

567
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:55,224
Listen, I know just what to do
to make you feel better.

568
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:57,557
- I feel fine.
- I wanna take you away this weekend.

569
00:34:57,628 --> 00:34:58,890
Do you fish?

570
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:02,889
- Okay, then we can go right now.
- I have a class.

571
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,730
Tonight at 7:00,
and I won't take no for an answer.

572
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:06,360
Try, please.

573
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:10,035
This woman is suffering inside.
That's all there is to it.

574
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,072
Yo, man, next time, I'll kick your ass!
That'll be that!

575
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:17,410
I'm just kidding, that's... It's a joke. It's...

576
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,076
How about that stock market?

577
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,585
You know, my broker is E.F. Hutton,
and E.F. Hutton says...

578
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,489
You see, it never works. It never works.

579
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:27,387
I've never seen that work
in my whole life.

580
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,260
Oh, shit!

581
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:36,829
So this is what it looks like.

582
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:39,163
This is great.

583
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:40,932
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

584
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:42,905
You got doors on the stalls.

585
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,033
They're not stopped... Wait a minute!

586
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:46,770
We don't have none of this stuff
in the boys'...

587
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:48,641
Wait a minute,
we don't got none of this.

588
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:50,476
We don't got doors
on the stalls in the boys' room.

589
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:51,606
We don't have... What is this?

590
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:53,479
We don't have a candy machine
in the boys' room.

591
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:55,314
- We don't got none of that. None of that.
- Enough screaming.

592
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:57,718
- You gotta get out of here.
- I'm sorry. No, I want the principal here.

593
00:35:57,788 --> 00:36:00,689
I want him here this instant.
I want... Now. This instant.

594
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:02,157
I'll wait. Thank you.

595
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,065
Oh, shit! Why can't I do this?

596
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,543
What have you done?

597
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:23,045
This... You have to subtotal first.

598
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,674
I tell you this every time.
You never listen.

599
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:30,948
One more tune, then it's off
to enjoy a terrible relationship.

600
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,483
The furrier next door loves this.

601
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,049
Soft words

602
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:39,619
They are spoke so gentle, yeah

603
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,591
It makes it easier

604
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:49,870
Easier to bear

605
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:55,743
You won't regret it, no, no

606
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:59,006
Young girls, they don't forget it

607
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:03,677
Love is their whole

608
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:05,881
happiness

609
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:07,356
Yeah

610
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:13,888
But it's all so easy

611
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:17,190
All you've gotta do is try

612
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:20,897
Try a little tenderness

613
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:21,961
Yeah

614
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:25,236
All you gotta do is, man

615
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:27,334
Hold her where you want her

616
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,778
You got to squeeze her,
don't tease her

617
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:32,372
Never leave her

618
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:34,348
Get to her

619
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:38,286
Got to, got to
try a little tenderness

620
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:40,517
Yeah, yeah, yeah
you've got to

621
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,491
know how to love her, man

622
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,256
Take this advice, man

623
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:48,457
You got to squeeze her,
don't tease her

624
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:49,658
Never leave

625
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:51,599
You got to hold her

626
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:53,796
And, brother, something else

627
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:57,204
Try a little tenderness
Yeah, yeah, yeah

628
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,776
You got to, brother

629
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,878
Don't lose her, no, no

630
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:06,076
You got to love her,
tease her, don't leave her

631
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,516
Got to try, now, now, now

632
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:11,419
Try, try a little tenderness

633
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:13,787
Yeah, watch the groove

634
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:16,952
You got to know what to do, man

635
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:18,586
Take this advice

636
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:23,327
You gotta love and squeeze,
don't tease my baby

637
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:24,868
Love her, Lord

638
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,800
Evening, young ladies.

639
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,101
This is a very good tune.
My mother used to sing this.

640
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:33,609
This is Otis. I love Otis.

641
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,009
We're closed.

642
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:36,736
You know what an older woman
does for me?

643
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,907
- Changes your diapers?
- Touche.

644
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,848
No, seriously though,
you're a very smoky alternative,

645
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:43,386
but this is the Duck Man's love in life.

646
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:46,184
- Shall we?
- Ever had one of these?

647
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:48,518
I don't think so.

648
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:52,890
Come on, let's plow.

649
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,068
Do I offend?

650
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:05,501
Andie, hon,

651
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:09,211
listen, it's after 7:00.

652
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,975
Don't waste good lip gloss.

653
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:12,242
I know, lona.

654
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,450
I mean, I don't mean to be a bitch
or anything,

655
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:17,646
but I don't think Mr. Wonderful's gonna
happen tonight.

656
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:23,256
I don't know what I'm doing.

657
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:25,390
Wishful make-uping.

658
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:26,919
Come on.

659
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,567
Wait, wait, you babes are, like, talking

660
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:33,728
a sign language that the old Ducker
here just does not understand.

661
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:36,796
Now, would you mind filling me in here?
I'm a little confused.

662
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:39,339
She got stood up, twerp.

663
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,504
Stood up? Wait, how so?
Wait, I'm here!

664
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:46,175
I mean, is this like one of those
feminine mystique deals or something?

665
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,546
He showed.

666
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,785
Andie?

667
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:07,565
I'll get that.

668
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:13,639
Duckie, I'm really sorry.

669
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:16,908
What is this...
You're gonna go out with this guy?

670
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:19,108
I mean, is this, you know,
like, a date or something?

671
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:21,708
Yeah. I mean, you'll like him.

672
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:24,254
He's not like the other guys, seriously.

673
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:27,046
No. No way. Andie!

674
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:29,917
You really piss me off,
you know, 'cause...

675
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:32,519
'Cause you know they shit all over
everybody, including you.

676
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,587
I just...
I can't believe you'd be this stupid.

677
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:36,929
Who's shitting on me?
I'm not gonna let anybody shit on me.

678
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:39,731
He's just... He's gonna use
your ass and throw you away.

679
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:41,396
God, I would've died for you!

680
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,236
So what am I supposed to do?
He asked me out, and I like him!

681
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:46,333
If I hate him because he's got...
Just listen to me.

682
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,708
If I hate him because he's got money,
that's the exact same thing

683
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,212
as them hating us because we don't.

684
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,509
Do you understand?

685
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:54,415
You can't do this and respect yourself.

686
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:56,076
You can't.

687
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:57,745
Well, I'll make that decision, all right?

688
00:40:57,822 --> 00:40:59,722
Sure, you can do what you want.

689
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,850
You know, you're talking like that
just because I'm going out with Blane.

690
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:05,259
Blane? His name is Blane?

691
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:08,129
That's a major appliance,
that's not a name!

692
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:12,192
Just because I'm going out with Blane,
doesn't mean I can't be friends with you.

693
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:14,203
I mean, it doesn't change
the way I feel about you.

694
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:17,035
Well, that's very nice. I'm glad. Here's...

695
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:18,432
Here's the point, Andie,

696
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:21,069
I'm not particularly concerned
with whether or not you like me.

697
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:25,440
'Cause I live to like you,
and I can't like you anymore.

698
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:29,819
So when you get your heart splattered
all over hell,

699
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:31,479
and you're feeling really low and dirty,

700
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:33,955
don't look to me to help
pump you back up,

701
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:35,389
'cause...

702
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:38,553
'Cause maybe for the first time
in your life, I won't be there!

703
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,390
I can't believe
you're actually saying this.

704
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,263
Well, I guess that's just tough shit!

705
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,444
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

706
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,889
That guy in the store.

707
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:11,359
Oh, he was a friend of mine.
I've known him since I was a kid.

708
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,962
He's a really nice guy.

709
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,930
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I like him a lot.

710
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:18,059
So do you wanna go home and change?

711
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:22,405
I already did.

712
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:24,098
- Sorry.
- No, that's okay.

713
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,899
Oh, boy.

714
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:30,838
So, where are we going?

715
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:32,949
You up for a party?

716
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,545
Yeah? No? Maybe?

717
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,644
No, I don't think so.

718
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:42,151
- Why?
- Why?

719
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,990
- Come on, they're my friends. It's okay.
- That's it, they're your friends.

720
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,428
I wouldn't take you
if I didn't think they'd accept you.

721
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:49,523
Can't we just go somewhere else?

722
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,364
Hey, Andie, I like you.
I think you like me.

723
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:54,771
I mean, we both know there's a lot
of bullshit that goes on,

724
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:56,271
but if you're above it, I'm above it.

725
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:00,140
You wanna make anything out of this
whatever, we gotta deal with it, right?

726
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,370
Yeah.

727
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:03,377
Come on, I got as much to lose as you.

728
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:04,744
We can go out with your friends
if you want.

729
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:06,407
Go crawl under a rock.

730
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:10,614
Anything you want. The choice is yours.

731
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:12,713
We can go hang-gliding.
You like hang-gliding?

732
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:16,055
- I've never been hang-gliding.
- Well, first for everything.

733
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:18,454
If it's a bad time, we leave.

734
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:59,032
- Hi, Blane.
- Hey, Eddie.

735
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,092
We'll see you later.

736
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:06,531
Come on.

737
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:08,936
Hey, what's up, bro?

738
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:15,516
Hey! Aren't you the girl in my art class?

739
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:18,114
Nice pearls.

740
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:21,080
- This isn't a dinner party, honey.
- Watch it.

741
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:24,093
- Hey, Blane, how you doing?
- Hey, Kev, what's up?

742
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:32,725
Great party, man.

743
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:36,896
- All right, man.
- Later.

744
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:57,950
I can't believe I actually associate
with these people, huh?

745
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,360
I can't believe that I'm actually here.

746
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:03,889
- Pretty bad, yeah?
- Yeah, it's pretty bad.

747
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:06,262
I'm sorry.

748
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:08,533
Hey, let's go upstairs, huh?

749
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:12,536
Come on.

750
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:15,274
Look, I didn't come here
to get you off, okay?

751
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:17,404
- That was not my idea.
- Andie.

752
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:20,609
Come on, that is not what I meant.
I haven't even tried to kiss you, have I?

753
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:24,046
Look, it's quieter up there, okay.

754
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:28,318
Come on. These hands will remain
in these pockets, I swear to God.

755
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:29,848
Come on.

756
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:34,486
Come on.

757
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:41,736
Look at me here.
Come on, I'm utterly defenseless.

758
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:44,270
And utterly foolish. Come on.

759
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:51,609
- So what do you think of these carpets?
- Oh, fab.

760
00:45:58,188 --> 00:45:59,746
It's gonna be great.

761
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,618
Oh, hey, Blane.

762
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:03,387
- Steff.
- How you doing?

763
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,484
- All right.
- Come on in.

764
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:05,823
No, I'll get another room.

765
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:09,093
No, no, no, come on in.
I'm just watching some 'toons here.

766
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,527
Who have you got with you here, Blane?

767
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,401
Andie, this is Steff. Steff, Andie.

768
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,868
Oh, well,
it's very nice to meet you, Andie.

769
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:23,473
Listen, you wanna come in
and sit down?

770
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:25,538
- Or you want the bed, is that it?
- No.

771
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:26,674
No. We're fine.

772
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,217
Well, at least come in and have a drink.

773
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,775
Let's go. Can I get you something?

774
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:33,380
I mean, this is my last serious party
of my high school career.

775
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:37,525
I hope you guys are gonna
tough it out until Sunday,

776
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:39,152
at least when my folks get home.

777
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:42,995
I think this one may just finally kill
the old son of a bitch, Blane.

778
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:47,329
Another giant step away
from virginity I went.

779
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:49,531
You are a slut, aren't you, Benny?

780
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:02,044
Oh, my God.

781
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:06,212
- Am I having a nightmare?
- We got guests.

782
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:10,525
I know you. You're in my calculus class.

783
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:13,562
- Gym.
- Your name's Jim?

784
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:15,860
Oh, you are worthless, aren't you?

785
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:18,866
You and your friends gave me
a lot of shit the other day.

786
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:21,234
- Everybody gives you shit.
- Take it easy, Benny, huh?

787
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:25,207
Hey, this is Steff's party, Blane.
Don't tell me what to do.

788
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:26,600
Steff.

789
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,805
I mean, you shouldn't be allowed
to invite just anybody.

790
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:34,711
- Steff, she's gonna ruin my night.
- Shut up, Benny!

791
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:38,749
- You're a faggot, Blane.
- All right. Okay. Listen, Benny.

792
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:42,788
- Listen, why don't we just...
- Where are you going?

793
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,589
Let's just leave them
with the room, okay?

794
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:45,685
Why?

795
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:47,627
And we will get you something to eat,
all right?

796
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:50,724
- Oh, you've got what I want.
- Maybe some ribs or something.

797
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:53,733
Listen, you guys enjoy yourselves,

798
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:56,272
and we'll see you later, maybe.

799
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,068
I doubt it.

800
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,039
- You all right?
- Fine.

801
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:01,702
- You're an asshole.
- All right.

802
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:03,777
And I don't wanna know what you are.

803
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:05,576
I'm gonna take her
to throw up somewhere.

804
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:08,209
- Listen, enjoy yourself, Blane.
- Come here.

805
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,481
They're kind of jerks
when they drink, huh?

806
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:16,451
- Bad idea.
- Can you just get me out of here now?

807
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:18,786
Yeah.

808
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:22,627
Look, I don't want to take you home.
I mean, I'd like to be with you.

809
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:25,395
If not here, somewhere else.
Anywhere you want.

810
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:29,935
I'm sorry. What can I say?
I made a mistake.

811
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:32,407
I over-estimated my friends. I'm sorry.

812
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:37,538
What, do you wanna hit me?

813
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:39,513
Yes, I do.

814
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:41,582
Be my guest.

815
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:13,041
You wanna know my thing?

816
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,215
If I really have it solid for a girl,

817
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:20,118
I'll ride by her house on my bike.

818
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:23,649
I'll do it like 100 times in a day.

819
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:26,453
And it's really... It's intense.

820
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:28,562
You ever park?

821
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:32,130
I'm kind of a drive-by kind of guy.

822
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:45,544
- Do you want a drink?
- Yeah.

823
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:46,639
- Yeah?
- Coke.

824
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:48,514
Coke. Coke? Okay.

825
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:52,852
Give me your address.
I'll put you on my route.

826
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,585
Okay, you're gonna have
to help me out here.

827
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:03,998
You know, someday that girl's gonna
realize just what she missed.

828
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:09,200
Come on, don't stop,
give me more! Yeah!

829
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:13,005
- Hi.
- Hi.

830
00:50:14,044 --> 00:50:15,875
Prince Charming wimp out?

831
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:17,811
No, no, he's at the bar.

832
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:20,510
Duckie?

833
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,244
He's sulking.

834
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:27,821
He's not gonna ride his bike
past your house anymore.

835
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:31,620
Duckie, you're being a real jerk.

836
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:37,062
How'd he get in here anyway?

837
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,662
I said he was my kid.

838
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:42,795
How come you're here?

839
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:45,704
I've been trying
to figure that out all night.

840
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:49,268
Can I get a cigarette from you, buddy?

841
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:52,405
Sorry.

842
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:55,280
- Mom make this for you?
- Yeah. Gross, huh?

843
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,509
Excuse me.

844
00:51:08,932 --> 00:51:10,160
- Hi.
- Hi.

845
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:12,358
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

846
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:15,064
- You met lona, didn't you?
- Not formally. Hi. Blane.

847
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:18,005
And that's Duckie Dale over there
behind the glasses.

848
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,669
- Hi, Duckie.
- Philip F. Dale to you, scum wad.

849
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:25,077
So, where you guys been?

850
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,313
Oh, a friend of mine was having a party.

851
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:30,580
Oh, how adorable.

852
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,021
Yeah, it was a little intense.

853
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,059
Oh, wait, wait.
You had an intense party?

854
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,452
No, it was a friend of mine's, I said.

855
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:41,724
Duckie, shut up.

856
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:44,858
What's the problem?

857
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,301
This is a classic,
classic piece of work here.

858
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:48,928
- Duckie, please.
- Phil.

859
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,040
Hey, Phil, I think you're making
Andie uncomfortable.

860
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,542
Why don't you just knock it off?
What's the problem?

861
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,271
I devoted my life to the girl,
and this guy,

862
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:57,040
he comes in one day
and thinks he knows her.

863
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,412
That's funny. You should give
David Letterman a ring sometime.

864
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:00,882
I'm sure he'd book you in a minute.

865
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,181
Phil, would you like us to leave?

866
00:52:03,253 --> 00:52:04,982
Yes, very perceptive.

867
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:06,845
Come on.

868
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:10,182
And look at the manners on this guy.

869
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:11,750
This was a treat.
Really, thanks a million.

870
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:13,591
You're a great couple of kids, really.

871
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:16,063
You know, I can't believe
I actually felt bad for you tonight,

872
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:17,725
retarded little dwarf!

873
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:19,691
See you.

874
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:21,602
Nice meeting you.

875
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:23,905
See you later.

876
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,464
- Sorry.
- No problem.

877
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:27,100
- No problem.
- You're an asshole.

878
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:30,374
Hey, blow me, butt wad. Coming
from you I take that as a compliment.

879
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:31,880
Andie! Yo!

880
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,581
You've been replaced.

881
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:45,720
Gee, I'm sorry.

882
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,542
Well, what now?

883
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:08,715
I gotta get up early.
Why don't we just forget it?

884
00:53:09,786 --> 00:53:11,048
What, home?

885
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:16,716
- Hey, you wanna go to my house?
- No, thanks.

886
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:20,619
You wanna eat?

887
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,723
- No.
- What do you wanna do?

888
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:25,229
Anything.

889
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:29,135
Why don't you just drop me off at Trax?

890
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,605
- You know, I can...
- Trax?

891
00:53:30,674 --> 00:53:31,766
It's real close to where I live.

892
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:33,274
Well, it's late. I'll just drop you home.

893
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:34,640
You wanna go home, I'll drop you home.

894
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,235
No, but I have something
I have to do there.

895
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:37,610
Now? Come on, it's late.

896
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:39,410
You wanna go home, I'll drop you home.
It's fine.

897
00:53:39,482 --> 00:53:41,416
- I don't want you to take me home.
- Okay, let's go out.

898
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:43,509
- No, I don't want...
- We'll go out anywhere you want,

899
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:45,214
- anything you wanna do.
- I don't wanna go out.

900
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:47,017
You don't wanna go out.
You don't wanna go home.

901
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:49,786
- What do you want to do, Andie?
- I don't want you to take me home.

902
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:51,690
Wait, I'm missing something.
I'm not a jerk here.

903
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:53,251
I don't understand what you're saying.
Wait a minute!

904
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:55,298
- Just go.
- Don't walk away. I'm talking to you.

905
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:56,263
- Don't. Just... Please!
- Why?

906
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:57,595
- Don't you understand me?
- No, I don't

907
00:53:58,001 --> 00:53:59,468
- at all, obviously.
- Will you listen to me?

908
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:03,199
- I don't want you to take me home.
- Okay. Why? What is the problem?

909
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:06,606
Because I don't want you to see
where I live, okay?

910
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:09,406
- What?
- I'm sorry, forget it.

911
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:10,571
It's okay.

912
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:15,147
Jesus Christ.

913
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:48,544
I'm really sorry for bumming out
the night for you.

914
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,745
You didn't bum out anything.
I had a great time.

915
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:54,715
- You liar.
- I was with you. I had a great time.

916
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:58,825
If I was in a Turkish prison,
I'd have a great time with you.

917
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,424
I don't know.
It's just too weird for me, you know.

918
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:05,161
- Maybe this shouldn't happen.
- What, you and me?

919
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:09,366
Well, you know,
maybe it doesn't happen all the time,

920
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:12,033
but it doesn't mean it isn't right. Right?

921
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,466
Doesn't mean you can't try.

922
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:21,548
Feel any better
if I asked you to the prom?

923
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,585
I mean, I know the prom's kind of lame,

924
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:28,180
so if you don't wanna go,
it's really no big deal.

925
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:03,623
Hey. What?

926
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:07,460
It happened! He asked me.

927
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:10,561
- And?
- I accepted!

928
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:12,191
Well, congratulations.

929
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:16,596
No more moping around the house
waiting for the telephone to ring.

930
00:56:17,774 --> 00:56:19,867
So you in love?

931
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:26,171
- Yeah, I think I am.
- Well, who is this guy?

932
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:30,881
His name is Blane and he's a senior.
He's so beautiful.

933
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,720
He's a richie.

934
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:38,159
- A whatie?
- A richie.

935
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:41,163
It's kind of stupid.
It's just his family has a lot of money.

936
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,358
Oh, well, is that a problem?

937
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:44,932
I don't know. It's just weird, you know.

938
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:47,993
His friends have a lot of money,
and he has a lot of money.

939
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,834
He drives a BMW.

940
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:53,908
Just, I don't know. I'm not really sure
if they're gonna accept me.

941
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:56,468
Well, what does that mean?

942
00:56:56,546 --> 00:56:59,037
I mean, you like him. He likes you.

943
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:01,873
What his friends think
shouldn't make any difference.

944
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:05,011
Yeah, but it's not just his friends.
It's my friends, too. It's everybody!

945
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,556
I'm just not real secure about it.

946
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:10,125
Well, so take the heat.

947
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:13,026
I mean, you like him. He likes you.
It's worth it.

948
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:14,185
Is it?

949
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:15,987
Well, isn't it?

950
00:57:18,034 --> 00:57:19,331
You're right.

951
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:22,998
I'm just overreacting, aren't I?

952
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:24,630
Well, not necessarily.

953
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:28,404
I mean, a good kiss can scramble
anybody's brain.

954
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,578
Look, just don't worry about it,
you know.

955
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:34,640
And wait and see
how you feel tomorrow.

956
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:37,685
- Good night, honey.
- Good night, thanks.

957
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:39,545
That's my baby.

958
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,487
Honey.

959
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:49,157
Wait a minute.
Could I ask you something?

960
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:50,324
Yeah.

961
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,564
Yeah, sometimes I feel a little sorry

962
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:00,575
that I'm the one you have to talk to
about these things.

963
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:01,871
I'm not.

964
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:05,213
She couldn't have said it
any better than you.

965
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:06,475
I mean it.

966
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:08,044
Good night.

967
00:59:06,342 --> 00:59:08,435
Okay, make my day.

968
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:11,145
I want all the gory details.

969
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:14,479
The mingling breath, pounding heart,

970
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:17,486
the steaming windows.
I want the whole skidoo.

971
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:20,250
Well, I hate to disappoint you,
but nothing happened.

972
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:22,986
Nothing?

973
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:26,894
Well, not nothing. I mean, I kissed him.

974
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:31,628
- Anywhere interesting?
- Oh, please.

975
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:34,299
So

976
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:37,137
does he have

977
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:39,768
strong lips?

978
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,668
How can you tell?

979
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:43,609
Do you feel it in your knees?

980
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:45,640
I felt it everywhere.

981
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:47,840
Strong lips.

982
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:55,917
Talk about lips.

983
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:00,186
I mean, I'm old enough to be his mother,

984
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,823
but when the Duck laid that kiss on me
last night,

985
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:06,835
I swear to God,
my thighs just went up in flames.

986
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:10,070
He must practice on melons
or something.

987
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,301
Is this your prom dress?

988
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:17,874
- Believe it or not.
- No, it's great.

989
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:20,839
- It's silly.
- It's a great material.

990
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:25,914
You know, I'm going.

991
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:28,054
To prom.

992
01:00:29,492 --> 01:00:30,925
Stop it.

993
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:34,462
No, I am. Last night he asked me,

994
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:37,399
and I don't know, I said yes.

995
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:39,830
Seems really weird,

996
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:42,968
but it might be kind of fun.

997
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:48,633
You were here for 15 minutes,
and you didn't even tell me!

998
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:51,005
I really, really wanted to go.

999
01:00:57,053 --> 01:00:58,611
You lucky girl.

1000
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:07,325
Isn't that a dreamy dress?

1001
01:01:25,381 --> 01:01:27,144
Lona, I have to go.

1002
01:01:27,216 --> 01:01:29,684
Can you just hold it
till this song is over?

1003
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:32,250
But I have to leave.

1004
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:37,618
Oh, why can't we start old
and get younger?

1005
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:44,022
I envy you.

1006
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:46,898
I really envy you!

1007
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:51,538
Lona, you're gonna OD on nostalgia.

1008
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:54,940
I loved The Big Chill.

1009
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:57,771
I love this dress.

1010
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,212
- It's a great dress.
- Yeah.

1011
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:05,285
My mother bought it for me.
God, she was so happy.

1012
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:09,381
It was the first and last time
I ever looked normal.

1013
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:11,586
I mean, you know, relatively speaking.

1014
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:13,421
It would've been a fairytale

1015
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:16,192
if my date hadn't been
the only one at the prom

1016
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:18,657
with a wife and two kids.

1017
01:02:21,304 --> 01:02:24,967
You wanna try it on?
I bet it'd look great on you.

1018
01:02:25,108 --> 01:02:27,599
I mean, your butt is 15 years
younger than mine.

1019
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:30,043
I mean, I used to have a great butt.

1020
01:02:30,113 --> 01:02:32,445
I did! I loved my butt!

1021
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:34,779
I wish I had photographs of it.
You wanna try this on?

1022
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:36,614
No, not right now.

1023
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:39,347
Oh, yeah, you got to go. I know. I know.

1024
01:02:40,056 --> 01:02:41,956
- I gotta get ready myself.
- You're going out?

1025
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:43,753
Yeah. New guy.

1026
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:47,352
Terrence, owns a pet shop.

1027
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:49,695
We'll see what happens.

1028
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:52,596
Have fun.

1029
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:55,870
- Give Mr. Perfecto a squeeze for me.
- Oh, I will.

1030
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:58,372
Hey, and listen,

1031
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:02,942
if you see your little Duck Man, be kind.

1032
01:03:03,346 --> 01:03:06,179
He's nursing
some fairly serious wounds.

1033
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:09,278
- Okay?
- Okay.

1034
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:12,078
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

1035
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:18,150
Hey, you know, we're going for sushi.

1036
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,722
Do you think this is too much?

1037
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:25,091
Bye.

1038
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:34,104
Thought that was very uncool of you
last night, Blane.

1039
01:03:34,177 --> 01:03:35,838
- What?
- What?

1040
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:39,580
- You mean Andie?
- Yeah, I mean Andie.

1041
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,841
What's the big deal? I like her.

1042
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:45,248
Matter of fact, I was pissed off
at you guys for being so nasty to her.

1043
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:48,620
It was way out of order for you
to foist her on the party.

1044
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:50,784
Steff, you hear yourself?

1045
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:52,794
You hear the same asshole shit I hear?

1046
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:54,989
What, do I have to spell it out
for you, Blane?

1047
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:56,292
I guess so.

1048
01:03:56,599 --> 01:03:59,159
Nobody appreciates
your sense of humor, you know.

1049
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:01,931
As a matter of fact, everybody is
just about to puke from you.

1050
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:03,869
You know, if you got a hard-on for trash,

1051
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:06,568
don't take care of it around us, pal,
all right?

1052
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:08,109
Right, buddy.

1053
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:12,174
Listen, I don't need a lot of shit on
this one, Blane, all right? I really don't.

1054
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:16,008
Money all that matters to you?

1055
01:04:16,085 --> 01:04:18,576
Where the hell does that come from?

1056
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:21,054
Come on, look around you.
Would I treat my parents' house like this

1057
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:23,250
if money was any kind of issue?

1058
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:24,990
Come on, why are you doing this?

1059
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:27,552
You know, why don't you just nail her
and get it over with?

1060
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:29,188
You know, why are you getting involved?

1061
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:30,664
Is there something wrong with that?

1062
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:33,566
I just think it's stupid.
You know, it's pointless.

1063
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:36,002
You know, and your parents,
I think they'll be thrilled.

1064
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:37,096
They have nothing to do with it.

1065
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:38,162
- Really?
- Yeah.

1066
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:42,041
I've seen your mother go to work on you,
Blane. You know, it's vicious.

1067
01:04:42,111 --> 01:04:43,942
And when Bill and Joyce
get through with you,

1068
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:46,641
you won't know whether to shit
or go sailing.

1069
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:51,953
Listen, I'm getting really bored
with this conversation, all right, Blane?

1070
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:55,548
You know, if you want your little
piece of low-grade ass, fine, take it.

1071
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:58,025
You know, but if you do,
you're not gonna have a friend.

1072
01:04:58,094 --> 01:05:00,654
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

1073
01:05:02,431 --> 01:05:05,093
I mean, if you want to make the choice,
go ahead, make it, all right?

1074
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:08,034
I personally wouldn't trash
a friendship over it.

1075
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:11,164
But, hey, I'm old-fashioned, so...

1076
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:14,868
Why don't you take a shower?
You look like shit.

1077
01:05:16,879 --> 01:05:20,110
If two weeks ago, somebody had
told me that I'd be going out with you,

1078
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:21,547
I never would have believed them.

1079
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:24,043
Why? I'm not all that bad.

1080
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,611
- No, but...
- What about me and you?

1081
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:31,656
You know, it's so insane
that somebody you've never met,

1082
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:34,287
never talked to, can be your enemy.

1083
01:05:39,135 --> 01:05:40,124
Yep.

1084
01:05:44,874 --> 01:05:47,069
You shouldn't meet my parents then.

1085
01:05:47,677 --> 01:05:48,803
Okay.

1086
01:05:50,646 --> 01:05:52,341
Well, I mean, they're not ogres,

1087
01:05:55,518 --> 01:05:58,681
but I think they still believe
in arranged marriages.

1088
01:05:59,755 --> 01:06:02,588
Corporate families
replaced royal families.

1089
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:06,227
I'm the crowned prince
of McDonnagh Electric.

1090
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:09,557
- It's irrelevant.
- No.

1091
01:06:14,337 --> 01:06:15,429
Yeah.

1092
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:22,741
- I could just tell them all to go to hell.
- Tell them to go to hell.

1093
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,746
- Everyone, friends, parents.
- All of them.

1094
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,076
All of them.

1095
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:29,441
What about you?

1096
01:06:31,787 --> 01:06:35,518
If somebody doesn't believe in me,
I can't believe in them.

1097
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:40,355
You don't lie, do you?

1098
01:06:41,364 --> 01:06:43,093
I don't have to lie.

1099
01:06:49,205 --> 01:06:51,036
This is gonna happen.

1100
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:54,536
Okay, I really want this to happen.

1101
01:07:29,912 --> 01:07:31,038
Yeah.

1102
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:26,157
- Can I help you?
- I'm fine, thank you.

1103
01:08:26,302 --> 01:08:28,065
Something for the prom?

1104
01:08:28,137 --> 01:08:29,331
Just looking.

1105
01:08:30,072 --> 01:08:32,267
Yeah, well, if you need anything...

1106
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:56,892
This is trash.

1107
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,831
It's very becoming.

1108
01:08:58,901 --> 01:09:02,530
Mother, it looks like I should be
standing on top of a wedding cake.

1109
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:04,630
Oh, darling, don't I wish.

1110
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:06,172
And I hate this material.

1111
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:08,676
And by the way,
I cannot stand baby blue.

1112
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:27,386
Well, do you know where he is?

1113
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:30,364
No, I'm sorry,
he didn't tell me where he was going.

1114
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:33,832
Okay, well, then if he calls or comes
home, can you just tell him to call me?

1115
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:35,302
- Who is this, please?
- Andie.

1116
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:36,766
- Who?
- Andie.

1117
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:39,467
- Well, yes, could I have your number?
- Yeah, no, he has the number.

1118
01:09:39,542 --> 01:09:41,476
Well, fine, I'll leave him a note, dear.

1119
01:09:41,544 --> 01:09:43,011
Okay, thanks, bye.

1120
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:48,849
Where the hell is he?

1121
01:09:54,223 --> 01:09:56,817
Don't fall in love, Ace.
You just won't like it.

1122
01:09:56,892 --> 01:09:58,757
It's very complicated.

1123
01:10:24,186 --> 01:10:25,175
Andie!

1124
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,357
Andie!

1125
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:38,293
- Andie.
- Come in.

1126
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,469
- Hi.
- Hi, Daddy.

1127
01:10:42,538 --> 01:10:44,233
I brought you something.

1128
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:46,300
What is it?

1129
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:49,310
Oh, just a little something
I picked up for you.

1130
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:54,040
Now, I know it's a little busy,

1131
01:10:54,116 --> 01:10:56,880
but I know you can make
something out of it, if you need to.

1132
01:10:56,952 --> 01:10:59,045
- Wow.
- Yeah, do you like it?

1133
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:01,713
- It's a beautiful color.
- Yeah.

1134
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:03,257
- It's really pretty.
- Yeah.

1135
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:06,317
God, it reminds me
so much of your mom.

1136
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:08,920
You know, she always wore pink,

1137
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:11,658
and she looked so beautiful in it.

1138
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,265
- It's okay.
- Okay.

1139
01:11:13,502 --> 01:11:15,026
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1140
01:11:17,406 --> 01:11:19,340
- Daddy.
- What?

1141
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:23,108
I just want you to know
I really appreciate this.

1142
01:11:23,178 --> 01:11:25,976
You know,
I think I can make something out of it.

1143
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:31,378
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure. What?

1144
01:11:35,424 --> 01:11:37,949
Where'd you get the money
to pay for this?

1145
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,658
Well, it wasn't that much.
I had some money.

1146
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:42,253
From your new job?

1147
01:11:42,698 --> 01:11:44,461
Yeah, from my new job.

1148
01:11:46,435 --> 01:11:48,164
I came home before work
on Wednesday,

1149
01:11:48,237 --> 01:11:50,102
and your car was in the driveway.

1150
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:54,032
You know, you didn't have to lie to me.

1151
01:11:54,109 --> 01:11:55,337
- Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't.

1152
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:56,673
Yes, I did. I had a line on something,

1153
01:11:56,745 --> 01:11:57,734
and I missed the appointment.

1154
01:11:57,813 --> 01:12:00,407
- Oh, why'd you miss the appointment?
- It slipped my mind.

1155
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:02,382
It didn't slip your mind.
You didn't want the job.

1156
01:12:02,451 --> 01:12:05,113
You just went to the counselor
because I forced you to. Am I right?

1157
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:06,552
Yeah, what's your point, Andie?

1158
01:12:06,622 --> 01:12:08,613
My point is you just didn't go!

1159
01:12:08,691 --> 01:12:10,716
You saying I deliberately
missed the appointment?

1160
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:11,782
Yes.

1161
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:14,891
Is this how you feel about me?

1162
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:17,521
Yes.

1163
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:21,660
- Well, I didn't know this.
- Well, now you do.

1164
01:12:22,638 --> 01:12:24,538
Oh, you know everything, now, huh?

1165
01:12:24,606 --> 01:12:27,439
You're 18, and you've got a scholarship,

1166
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:29,500
- That's not fair.
...and you're grown up and free,

1167
01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:30,943
and I'm just an ignorant son of a bitch

1168
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:33,447
- that never gave you anything.
- Hey, I never asked for anything.

1169
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:34,777
Oh, that's brilliant!

1170
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:36,875
Why can't you just forget her?

1171
01:12:37,252 --> 01:12:38,583
It's late. You got school.

1172
01:12:38,654 --> 01:12:41,452
No, don't walk out on this!
Will you please just listen to me?

1173
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:43,718
- Please?
- I've already been through this, Andie.

1174
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:46,488
Sure, you go through it every day!
You're still going through it!

1175
01:12:46,562 --> 01:12:48,723
Why can't you just realize
that she's gone,

1176
01:12:48,797 --> 01:12:50,321
and she's not gonna come back?

1177
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:52,196
She's never coming back!

1178
01:12:52,267 --> 01:12:54,929
- Shut up! God damn it!
- Why can't you accept it?

1179
01:12:55,003 --> 01:12:56,903
She's just gone! She...

1180
01:12:57,706 --> 01:12:59,731
Why can't you accept it?

1181
01:13:01,076 --> 01:13:04,807
Because I love her, that's why.

1182
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:07,979
Well, I loved her, too, you know.

1183
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:12,320
She just didn't love us back.

1184
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:19,717
Okay, she tried.

1185
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:22,930
I don't know, she just couldn't handle it.

1186
01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:25,558
Yeah, but I knew it.

1187
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:27,497
I knew it all along.

1188
01:13:27,703 --> 01:13:29,796
I mean, when I was five, I felt it.

1189
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:33,140
Remember when she didn't come home
that time?

1190
01:13:34,209 --> 01:13:35,767
I knew it then. I knew why.

1191
01:13:35,844 --> 01:13:39,575
I was 14 and I knew it.
You were 50 and you didn't.

1192
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:43,582
You know, you can't go on
living every day in the past.

1193
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,911
She left us, Daddy. We didn't leave her.

1194
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:50,152
There was nothing we could do about it.
It just happened.

1195
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:56,489
Since when is a daughter supposed
to know more than her father?

1196
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:01,769
I've just been a blind fool.

1197
01:14:03,405 --> 01:14:06,533
And you're a blind fool
that needs a shave, too, you know that?

1198
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:08,303
And I need a shave.

1199
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:11,807
Well,

1200
01:14:13,415 --> 01:14:15,713
you better get to bed. You got school.

1201
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:17,585
And I gotta hit the hay, too,

1202
01:14:17,653 --> 01:14:21,646
'cause I got a few things
I gotta do tomorrow, okay?

1203
01:14:21,924 --> 01:14:23,016
Okay.

1204
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:32,195
I would've got you some shoes,
but I didn't know your size.

1205
01:15:47,075 --> 01:15:48,064
Melanie.

1206
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:10,326
How you doing?

1207
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:12,662
Why haven't you called me?

1208
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:14,497
Oh, I got nailed for the stable thing.

1209
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:17,038
I guess a groom saw us.
It's against club rules.

1210
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:19,665
I called you three times,
and I left messages.

1211
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:21,433
Yeah?

1212
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:22,937
Well, I didn't get them.

1213
01:16:23,011 --> 01:16:25,980
My family, they're irresponsible
about that stuff, you know.

1214
01:16:26,315 --> 01:16:28,249
I waited for you this morning.

1215
01:16:29,084 --> 01:16:31,211
- Yeah? Where?
- Parking lot.

1216
01:16:33,889 --> 01:16:36,380
I saw you,
and I thought that you saw me.

1217
01:16:38,226 --> 01:16:39,215
No.

1218
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:43,189
What about prom, Blane?

1219
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:47,794
Oh, Andie, I'm having a bad day.
Can we talk later?

1220
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:49,734
No. What about prom?

1221
01:16:49,805 --> 01:16:50,965
Come on.
Why don't we just meet after school?

1222
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:53,667
- No! What about prom?
- Andie, come on.

1223
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:54,901
- Just say it.
- What?

1224
01:16:54,977 --> 01:16:57,969
Just say it! I want to hear you say it.

1225
01:16:59,414 --> 01:17:01,177
Andie, please, all right.

1226
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:03,045
I wanna hear you say it!

1227
01:17:06,321 --> 01:17:08,721
A month ago I asked somebody else,
and I forgot.

1228
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:09,984
You're a liar!

1229
01:17:10,058 --> 01:17:12,026
You're a filthy, fucking, no-good liar!

1230
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:14,255
You don't have the guts
to tell me the truth!

1231
01:17:14,329 --> 01:17:15,762
- Just say it!
- I'm not lying.

1232
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:16,889
- Tell me!
- What?

1233
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:18,159
- Tell me!
- What do you wanna hear?

1234
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:19,894
- Just tell me!
- What?

1235
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:22,027
- You're ashamed to be seen with me!
- No, I am not!

1236
01:17:22,104 --> 01:17:23,662
- You're ashamed to go out with me!
- I am not.

1237
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:24,728
- You're afraid.
- No, I am...

1238
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:27,673
You're terrified your goddamn
rich friends won't approve!

1239
01:17:27,743 --> 01:17:30,837
Just say it! Just tell me the truth!

1240
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:38,951
You don't understand that
it has nothing at all to do with you.

1241
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:41,279
Andie!

1242
01:17:43,425 --> 01:17:44,585
Andie!

1243
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:07,912
Forget about it, man.
It's not worth getting upset over.

1244
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:09,916
Why don't you just take off, Steff?
Please.

1245
01:18:09,985 --> 01:18:11,418
Well, listen, any girl that did that to me

1246
01:18:11,486 --> 01:18:14,455
I would not be too jazzed
to hold onto, Blane.

1247
01:18:15,557 --> 01:18:18,287
It's not worth it, man. I told you
it wasn't gonna work, you know.

1248
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,158
The girl was, is
and will always be nada.

1249
01:18:53,595 --> 01:18:55,324
You got a problem, friend?

1250
01:19:14,116 --> 01:19:15,174
Come on.

1251
01:19:30,365 --> 01:19:31,889
All right! All right!

1252
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:44,511
That's nice, huh?

1253
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:02,557
Andie?

1254
01:20:03,532 --> 01:20:05,591
- Yeah?
- You're Andie, aren't you?

1255
01:20:05,734 --> 01:20:08,225
Yeah, I am. How do you know me?

1256
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:10,464
Well, lona told me. I'm Terrence.

1257
01:20:10,839 --> 01:20:11,828
Terry.

1258
01:20:11,907 --> 01:20:13,875
Oh, the pet shop. Right?

1259
01:20:13,942 --> 01:20:15,170
Yeah, among other things.

1260
01:20:15,243 --> 01:20:16,835
She's in the bedroom getting ready.

1261
01:20:16,912 --> 01:20:19,142
You might wanna go in there
and tell her to shake her tail feather.

1262
01:20:19,214 --> 01:20:21,182
- We're late.
- Okay.

1263
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:25,909
Iona?

1264
01:20:28,857 --> 01:20:30,222
Nice to meet you.

1265
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:49,235
- Iona?
- Hi, honey, I'm in here.

1266
01:20:51,446 --> 01:20:53,175
Laugh and I'll deck you.

1267
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,738
What happened?

1268
01:20:56,651 --> 01:20:59,119
Either it's all those drugs
I took in the '60s,

1269
01:20:59,187 --> 01:21:01,781
or I am really in love.

1270
01:21:04,025 --> 01:21:06,118
What do you think? Honestly.

1271
01:21:06,828 --> 01:21:08,989
Honestly, I think you look great.

1272
01:21:09,664 --> 01:21:11,063
Oh, I look like a mother.

1273
01:21:11,132 --> 01:21:14,863
No. Well, yeah, a little, but that's okay.

1274
01:21:16,271 --> 01:21:17,795
You look happy.

1275
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:19,799
I am.

1276
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:23,643
It's weird, but I... Did you meet him?

1277
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:25,703
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1278
01:21:26,348 --> 01:21:30,045
He's a yuppie, but he's so nice.

1279
01:21:30,118 --> 01:21:32,552
He's employed. He's heterosexual.

1280
01:21:32,621 --> 01:21:35,681
I swear to God, I'm so far ahead
of the game, next time you see me

1281
01:21:35,757 --> 01:21:38,453
I'll probably be picking out
my china pattern or something.

1282
01:21:41,162 --> 01:21:43,528
Hey, are you all right? No, you're not.

1283
01:21:44,532 --> 01:21:47,399
- What, did I blow your mind?
- No, that's not it.

1284
01:21:48,203 --> 01:21:49,534
Is it boy trouble?

1285
01:21:50,939 --> 01:21:53,430
- The worst?
- Way beyond.

1286
01:21:54,042 --> 01:21:55,771
He backed out on me.

1287
01:21:56,645 --> 01:22:00,081
He said he asked somebody else,
and he forgot about it.

1288
01:22:01,883 --> 01:22:04,818
I can't believe it. I can't believe it.

1289
01:22:08,189 --> 01:22:10,054
I'm so humiliated.

1290
01:22:11,393 --> 01:22:13,691
I could've killed him! I swear!

1291
01:22:14,396 --> 01:22:16,523
You know, I just walked right into it.

1292
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:18,862
No, no.

1293
01:22:19,801 --> 01:22:22,668
Oh, love is awful, isn't it?

1294
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:26,639
It's okay.

1295
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:38,742
You remember when I...
And when you said that

1296
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:41,345
if I wanted your prom dress
I could have it?

1297
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:44,415
Well, I need it. I want it.

1298
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:49,155
- What for?
- I just need it.

1299
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:52,658
Okay.

1300
01:22:56,004 --> 01:22:57,403
It's yours.

1301
01:24:39,774 --> 01:24:42,538
Oh, my God. Look at you.

1302
01:24:44,512 --> 01:24:45,706
Another first.

1303
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:48,078
Your guy's gonna fall to the floor
when he comes in.

1304
01:24:48,149 --> 01:24:49,411
No, he won't.

1305
01:24:49,517 --> 01:24:50,916
The hell he's not.

1306
01:24:51,419 --> 01:24:54,013
No, he really won't. He's not coming.

1307
01:24:54,522 --> 01:24:56,422
- What?
- It's okay.

1308
01:24:57,292 --> 01:24:59,624
- I'm gonna go.
- Alone?

1309
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:02,896
Yeah, I'm not sad about it. I'm not hurt.

1310
01:25:03,498 --> 01:25:06,194
I mean, you know, I am hurt a little bit.

1311
01:25:06,534 --> 01:25:09,025
But I know if I don't do it
I'll just feel a lot worse.

1312
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:12,540
I'm just gonna go in,
walk in, walk out and come home.

1313
01:25:13,575 --> 01:25:14,564
You sure?

1314
01:25:17,045 --> 01:25:19,036
I just wanna let them know
that they didn't break me.

1315
01:26:01,556 --> 01:26:03,183
- Open up.
- Thank you.

1316
01:26:04,259 --> 01:26:05,487
You're such trash.

1317
01:26:17,472 --> 01:26:20,498
Well, as soon as anybody's ready
to go upstairs and get serious,

1318
01:26:20,575 --> 01:26:21,974
just let me know.

1319
01:26:22,043 --> 01:26:23,943
We've only been here an hour.

1320
01:26:24,112 --> 01:26:26,945
We can go up and come back
down again, Benny, all right.

1321
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:29,040
Did you look at the suite?

1322
01:26:29,484 --> 01:26:33,250
It's $300 a night, Benny.
It's not gonna be a palace, okay?

1323
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:35,349
I think we should stay for a while.

1324
01:26:35,423 --> 01:26:38,221
We're not gonna see these people
for much longer.

1325
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,955
Come on, it's kind of the end, okay?

1326
01:26:41,462 --> 01:26:43,692
I don't give a shit what you do.

1327
01:27:16,931 --> 01:27:17,920
Damn it.

1328
01:27:58,339 --> 01:27:59,328
Oh, my God!

1329
01:28:02,677 --> 01:28:04,372
You're here! What happened?

1330
01:28:04,445 --> 01:28:08,108
- Well, I guess you're looking at it.
- Oh, wow, you look great.

1331
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:11,711
Thanks, you look stunning, really.

1332
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:14,087
It's breathtaking.

1333
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:17,253
No, and listen, I want you to know,

1334
01:28:17,325 --> 01:28:19,691
despite my appearance at this function,

1335
01:28:20,261 --> 01:28:23,753
I remain now and will always be
a Duck Man.

1336
01:28:30,204 --> 01:28:32,001
May I admire you?

1337
01:28:32,373 --> 01:28:34,466
Oh, if you wish.

1338
01:28:38,379 --> 01:28:39,812
Let's plow.

1339
01:29:21,889 --> 01:29:23,254
Should we dance?

1340
01:29:25,026 --> 01:29:26,755
It wouldn't be unheard of.

1341
01:29:31,632 --> 01:29:33,862
A little, lingering doubt perhaps, Blane?

1342
01:29:34,769 --> 01:29:36,327
You know,
you gotta give her credit though.

1343
01:29:36,404 --> 01:29:38,167
I mean, after you dumped her,

1344
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:39,706
she certainly went out and found herself

1345
01:29:39,774 --> 01:29:43,005
what I'd have to say is probably
the most interesting date

1346
01:29:43,077 --> 01:29:44,840
- that our generation...
- Steff.

1347
01:29:47,782 --> 01:29:49,044
You buy everything, Steff.

1348
01:29:49,117 --> 01:29:51,517
You couldn't buy her, though.
That's what's killing you, isn't it?

1349
01:29:51,586 --> 01:29:53,850
- I don't wanna listen to this.
- Steff.

1350
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:55,947
That's it, Steff.

1351
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:59,223
She thinks you're shit,

1352
01:30:00,762 --> 01:30:03,128
and deep down you know she's right.

1353
01:30:17,745 --> 01:30:18,734
Hi.

1354
01:30:20,181 --> 01:30:21,170
Hi.

1355
01:30:34,629 --> 01:30:37,097
You don't need me to say I'm sorry.

1356
01:30:37,565 --> 01:30:40,625
It's done. It's over with. I'm fine.

1357
01:30:42,837 --> 01:30:45,203
Oh, well, if that's true, then I'm glad.

1358
01:30:51,145 --> 01:30:52,635
It's not true.

1359
01:30:53,981 --> 01:30:56,006
It doesn't matter, does it?

1360
01:30:57,485 --> 01:30:59,043
You told me
you couldn't believe in somebody

1361
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:01,680
who didn't believe in you.
I believed in you.

1362
01:31:02,056 --> 01:31:03,921
I always believed in you.

1363
01:31:04,992 --> 01:31:07,017
You just didn't believe in me.

1364
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:13,798
I love you.

1365
01:31:20,608 --> 01:31:21,836
Always.

1366
01:31:30,518 --> 01:31:31,712
Andie,

1367
01:31:34,155 --> 01:31:35,747
he came here alone.

1368
01:31:39,393 --> 01:31:43,022
Okay, you're right.
He's not like the others.

1369
01:31:47,935 --> 01:31:49,664
If you don't go to him now,

1370
01:31:49,737 --> 01:31:51,705
I'm never gonna take you
to another prom ever again,

1371
01:31:51,772 --> 01:31:52,932
you hear me?

1372
01:31:53,441 --> 01:31:57,502
I mean, this is an incredibly romantic
moment, and you're ruining it for me.

1373
01:32:02,149 --> 01:32:03,446
Thanks, Duckie.

1374
01:32:06,454 --> 01:32:07,716
Go ahead.

1375
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:44,384
Blane.

1376
01:36:40,224 --> 01:36:42,384
5@y3
