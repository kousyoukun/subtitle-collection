1
00:01:32,196 --> 00:01:34,272
Daddy, it's 7.30!

2
00:01:38,994 --> 00:01:41,034
Daddy, it's 7.30!

3
00:01:42,373 --> 00:01:44,200
Daddy, wake up!

4
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:47,620
Morning, Daddy. Come on, wake up!

5
00:01:47,753 --> 00:01:49,793
Wake up! Come on, wake up.

6
00:01:50,923 --> 00:01:54,090
- There's your coffee right there.
- Where am I?

7
00:01:55,386 --> 00:01:57,544
Here, I want you to drink this.

8
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,930
Then take a shower and get dressed.
Your clothes are there.

9
00:02:01,058 --> 00:02:04,676
Then I want you to see the woman
about the job. Today. You promised.

10
00:02:04,812 --> 00:02:08,062
I know. What would I do without
you nagging me all the time?

11
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,313
You really want me to answer that?

12
00:02:12,236 --> 00:02:16,697
Yeah, I've been gettin' in kinda late
lately. We haven't had a chance to talk.

13
00:02:16,824 --> 00:02:19,778
Don't worry about it.
There hasn't been a lot to say.

14
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,828
- Is everything all right with you?
- Yeah.

15
00:02:22,955 --> 00:02:27,083
- Is school good?
- No, but it never is.

16
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:31,373
- Have you been asked to the prom?
- No. Not yet.

17
00:02:32,464 --> 00:02:35,252
When was the last time
I told you how beautiful you are?

18
00:02:35,384 --> 00:02:37,424
About yesterday.

19
00:02:38,929 --> 00:02:40,721
- Turn around.
- What?

20
00:02:40,848 --> 00:02:43,220
You know what. Let me see this outfit.

21
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,766
- Is this your latest creation?
- This is it.

22
00:02:46,896 --> 00:02:49,268
My God, what did that cost you?

23
00:02:49,398 --> 00:02:53,562
About $15 for the shoes, second-hand,
and I made the rest.

24
00:02:53,694 --> 00:02:55,734
Unbelievable.

25
00:02:57,364 --> 00:03:01,029
I was thinking maybe that
you could do something with this.

26
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,698
- Maybe put some ruffles here...
- Come on, get up!

27
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:06,616
Really, I mean it.
This means a lot to me.

28
00:03:06,749 --> 00:03:09,240
I am perfectly happy
with what I'm doing.

29
00:03:09,376 --> 00:03:11,914
Perfectly happy with part-time work?

30
00:03:13,088 --> 00:03:17,300
- No. That's why I'm getting up.
- OK. I'll make you some breakfast.

31
00:03:28,062 --> 00:03:29,462
I'm up.

32
00:03:53,754 --> 00:03:55,996
- Hi, Blane.
- Hi, Kate. How you doin'?

33
00:03:56,131 --> 00:03:57,958
- Fine. How are you?
- Good.

34
00:04:10,312 --> 00:04:13,099
Morning! Welcome to another day
of higher education.

35
00:04:13,232 --> 00:04:17,182
- Hi, Duckie. How are you?
- Not bad, considering I'm in this dump.

36
00:04:19,321 --> 00:04:22,571
This is a really volcanic ensemble you're wearing.

37
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,988
- Volcanic?
- You know, hot, dangerous...

38
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:28,784
- Are you going to class today?
- I don't know if I'm emotionally ready.

39
00:04:28,914 --> 00:04:31,037
Go for it. It's virtually painless.

40
00:04:32,751 --> 00:04:34,910
- I gotta go. I'll see you at lunch.
- OK.

41
00:04:35,045 --> 00:04:38,664
I'll call the cafeteria and make
a reservation - two by the window.

42
00:04:38,788 --> 00:04:39,788
Sure.

43
00:04:39,888 --> 00:04:42,711
No, you don't like to sit in the sun.
OK, something else.

44
00:04:42,845 --> 00:04:45,217
Listen, may I admire you again today?

45
00:04:51,312 --> 00:04:53,850
Ladies. I may be able
to work out a deal

46
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:58,560
where either one or the both of you
could be pregnant by the holidays.

47
00:05:03,032 --> 00:05:06,198
Some argue that the New Deal
saved the capitalist system.  美國羅斯福總統實施的內政名稱 有些人認為 "新政"拯救了資本主義

48
00:05:06,327 --> 00:05:09,197
There's evidence that
the Roosevelt administration  如證據所示  羅斯福政府

49
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,908
是在避免防止過多的政府權利

50
00:05:14,043 --> 00:05:16,035
而不是移植社會主義

51
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,044
來作為他當總統的第一把火

52
00:05:18,172 --> 00:05:21,457
Mr Roosevelt enacted
the Emergency Banking Act, 羅斯福總統制定的《緊急銀行法》

53
00:05:21,592 --> 00:05:24,593
and he refused
to consider nationalisation.他拒絕了考慮國有化

54
00:05:29,808 --> 00:05:36,143
Where'd you get your clothes?
Five-and-dime store? Attractive! 你那件衣服從哪來的?
廉價商店? 挺迷人的

55
00:05:36,273 --> 00:05:38,515
妳們有問題嗎 女孩們?

56
00:05:39,693 --> 00:05:41,318
沒有
沒

57
00:05:43,739 --> 00:05:47,571
Andie, is there something going on
between you and these ladies?安蒂 妳和這兩位女士有什麼糾紛嗎?

58
00:05:47,701 --> 00:05:49,741
沒有 我不知道有什麼糾紛

59
00:05:51,997 --> 00:05:55,781
我代表莊柏琳和韓森兩位小姐道歉

60
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:57,957
這兩位小姐今晚會想念你們的

61
00:05:58,087 --> 00:06:01,456
因為她們會被留下罰寫
我們剛才討論過的章節摘要

62
00:06:03,592 --> 00:06:04,792
真行!

63
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,797
不好意思
嗯?

64
00:06:12,434 --> 00:06:17,725
我真的沒問題 我很好
可以請妳忘了抄章節事嗎?

65
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:22,266
請說?
我們會抄章節的

66
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:25,318
很好 讓我們繼續上課

67
00:06:26,198 --> 00:06:28,238
《緊急銀行法》

68
00:06:31,662 --> 00:06:33,785
I'll see you guys later.待會見

69
00:06:34,707 --> 00:06:37,376
哦 安蒂 妳看起來真迷人

70
00:06:37,501 --> 00:06:39,245
我們再一個月就要畢業了

71
00:06:39,378 --> 00:06:42,462
什麼時候妳會和我再一起
然後做些什麼事情?

72
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,000
永遠不會

73
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:47,418
我說的是止上床以外的事情 
別裝了吧

74
00:06:47,678 --> 00:06:50,928
I've liked you for four years
and you treat me like shit. 妳知道我已經喜歡妳四年了
妳卻還是對我不理不睬

75
00:06:51,056 --> 00:06:53,547
我不明白
到底妳有什麼問題?

76
00:06:53,684 --> 00:06:56,305
你可以離我的車遠點嗎?

77
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,851
你知道嗎 我在這間學校跟很多女孩約會過了

78
00:07:00,983 --> 00:07:04,150
我不懂你為什麼如此與眾不同?
我還是有點品味的

79
00:07:06,155 --> 00:07:08,194
你真是個婊子

80
00:07:09,825 --> 00:07:14,286
你知道嗎 你應該去看個醫生
不然你的症狀會更嚴重

81
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,280
(80年代)

82
00:07:43,609 --> 00:07:48,485
掌聲 掌聲 掌聲..

83
00:07:49,448 --> 00:07:52,899
這太美了 這太...

84
00:07:53,035 --> 00:07:54,435
現代了

85
00:07:55,162 --> 00:07:57,321
我是指 這樣很棒
對吧?

86
00:07:57,581 --> 00:07:59,781
很棒

87
00:08:00,042 --> 00:08:03,411
我對這非常非常的在行
我知道

88
00:08:03,546 --> 00:08:08,006
這對經營一間小間零售店的我來說
可有多浪費 

89
00:08:08,551 --> 00:08:12,714
如果你對這方面很在行就不會是浪費
我在床上很在行 我應該當個妓女嗎?

90
00:08:17,476 --> 00:08:19,516
It's great.

91
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:25,473
- Did you say you went to your prom?
- Yeah, sure.

92
00:08:25,609 --> 00:08:28,527
- Was it terrible?
- It was the worst.

93
00:08:28,654 --> 00:08:31,821
But it's supposed to be.
But you have to go, right?

94
00:08:32,575 --> 00:08:35,244
You don't have to.
I mean, it's not a requirement.

95
00:08:35,619 --> 00:08:37,576
A girlfriend of mine didn't go to hers.

96
00:08:37,705 --> 00:08:41,619
Once in a while she gets a terrible
feeling, like something is missing.

97
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,914
She checks her purse and her keys,
she counts her kids, she goes crazy.

98
00:08:46,046 --> 00:08:48,668
And then she realises that...

99
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:51,088
nothing is missing.

100
00:08:51,218 --> 00:08:54,338
She decided it was side effects
from skipping the prom.

101
00:08:55,514 --> 00:08:58,515
I don't know. Part of me says
just go and get it over with,

102
00:08:58,642 --> 00:09:02,474
and this other part says it's a stupid
tradition and what's the point?

103
00:09:02,605 --> 00:09:04,478
Well, you know...

104
00:09:04,607 --> 00:09:09,684
You could say that life itself
is a stupid tradition.

105
00:09:11,238 --> 00:09:14,192
Don't analyse it. Just go.

106
00:09:18,787 --> 00:09:21,457
Put that back!

107
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:25,043
- You missed my eye by an inch!
- Half an inch.

108
00:09:26,962 --> 00:09:29,916
This ain't the public library, lightfingers!

109
00:09:56,492 --> 00:09:58,531
I'll get it!

110
00:10:02,164 --> 00:10:04,453
Trax. What do you want?

111
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,999
Tyrone, you blow.

112
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:11,461
Yeah, I'm workin'. Leave me alone.

113
00:10:14,677 --> 00:10:17,132
That's thrilling!

114
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:20,180
I cook for you, I do your laundry,
I sleep with you,

115
00:10:20,307 --> 00:10:22,347
now you want a ride to work?

116
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,495
Grow up!

117
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,979
Take the bus...

118
00:10:32,444 --> 00:10:33,903
How you doin'?

119
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:35,689
- Fine.
- Good.

120
00:10:35,823 --> 00:10:38,148
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

121
00:10:38,284 --> 00:10:42,281
- Can I get your opinion on something?
- Maybe.

122
00:10:42,705 --> 00:10:43,905
Maybe.

123
00:10:45,457 --> 00:10:48,209
This any good?

124
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:54,046
It's hot. White hot.

125
00:10:55,843 --> 00:10:57,882
Good, I'll take it.

126
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:01,514
OK. That'd be cash or charge?

127
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:05,138
American Express
Platinum Card, maybe?

128
00:11:06,979 --> 00:11:07,979
Cash.

129
00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:13,932
You know, every time you go
to the john, you lose IQ points.

130
00:11:15,404 --> 00:11:17,860
It's Walter Mondale.

131
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:23,067
- Just 7.50. There's your change.
- Thanks.

132
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:28,823
- I don't need a bag.
- No?

133
00:11:31,462 --> 00:11:33,289
- Thanks.
- Enjoy it.

134
00:11:35,007 --> 00:11:39,420
Bondage has no place in my life.
Since when?

135
00:11:39,803 --> 00:11:43,504
Since I spent the night tied up
in the back seat of your car!

136
00:12:28,853 --> 00:12:30,513
- Jena.
- Yeah?

137
00:12:30,646 --> 00:12:34,726
Would you ever consider going out
with somebody that had money?

138
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:39,486
I don't think it makes
a difference. I mean...

139
00:12:40,322 --> 00:12:42,813
It's material.

140
00:12:45,786 --> 00:12:47,992
Simon! Simon!

141
00:12:48,622 --> 00:12:51,292
What would you do if your father
came home a rich man?

142
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:54,038
- Kiss his ass.
- See?

143
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,458
- See what?
- What Simon just said.

144
00:12:57,047 --> 00:12:58,447
What...

145
00:12:59,717 --> 00:13:02,801
What are you gettin' at?
Are you goin' out with a rich guy?

146
00:13:02,928 --> 00:13:05,846
- I gotta go.
- Hey, you didn't answer my question.

147
00:13:05,973 --> 00:13:07,467
- No.
- Good.

148
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,639
Simon, it's been stimulating.

149
00:13:11,937 --> 00:13:15,271
- How long have I been coming here?
- I dunno. A couple of years.

150
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:18,815
- OK, so we're buddies, we're close.
- Yeah. Very pally.

151
00:13:18,944 --> 00:13:21,482
OK! So how many times
have you let me in?

152
00:13:21,989 --> 00:13:25,025
- I never let you in. You know that.
- You see what I'm sayin'?

153
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:29,488
- I dunno. What are you sayin'?
- My girlfriend is in there and I'm here...

154
00:13:29,622 --> 00:13:32,991
Well, she's a girl and she's my friend,
so she's a girl friend.

155
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:37,668
But she's in there and I'm out here!
You're a sensitive, sexually potent guy.

156
00:13:37,796 --> 00:13:41,746
- You gotta know how that hurts!
- Let me ask you a question, seriously.

157
00:13:42,134 --> 00:13:45,218
Why does she come here,
knowing I don't let you in?

158
00:13:45,346 --> 00:13:48,845
- Think about it.
- I don't know.

159
00:13:50,226 --> 00:13:53,013
Anyway, my advice to you is...

160
00:13:53,145 --> 00:13:56,063
dump her, lose her.
You don't need that.

161
00:13:56,524 --> 00:13:59,975
You see what I'm sayin'?
You see the point I'm tryin' to make?

162
00:14:00,236 --> 00:14:03,236
Love's a bitch, Duck. Love's a bitch.

163
00:14:03,739 --> 00:14:06,312
- Ain't it the truth?
- It's the truth.

164
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,822
- High five.
- All right!

165
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,118
Wanna try a cigarette?

166
00:14:13,165 --> 00:14:15,372
Let me ask you a personal question.

167
00:14:15,501 --> 00:14:18,834
If you worship the Duck, why not
hang out somewhere he could get in?

168
00:14:18,963 --> 00:14:23,210
Nice Dice Man! Say hello to the wife
and kids. You know what I'm sayin'?

169
00:14:23,342 --> 00:14:26,711
He's dyslexic. He gets everything
backwards. He meant to say...

170
00:14:26,846 --> 00:14:28,838
- It's OK, Duckie.
- OK. You're sure?

171
00:14:28,973 --> 00:14:31,428
I could clean up this parking lot
with his butt.

172
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:33,931
- No, I'm fine. Don't worry about me.
- OK.

173
00:14:34,061 --> 00:14:37,015
- Were you here long?
- No, no. Three, four hours.

174
00:14:37,147 --> 00:14:38,891
You have a good time?

175
00:14:39,024 --> 00:14:41,598
- Good. That's good. What now?
- Bed.

176
00:14:41,735 --> 00:14:43,775
Yours or mine?

177
00:14:43,988 --> 00:14:45,814
- Ours?
- Nice try.

178
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:48,029
OK. Can you at least
give me a ride home?

179
00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:50,198
Yeah. Get in.

180
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,113
Can I put my head in your lap?

181
00:14:53,247 --> 00:14:56,201
Can I rest my head
on your shoulder and let you steer?

182
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,373
- Get in, Duckie.
- OK.

183
00:15:03,966 --> 00:15:06,338
These houses are amazing, Duck.

184
00:15:06,468 --> 00:15:09,968
The first million I make,
I'll buy you one. I hate this song.

185
00:15:10,097 --> 00:15:14,011
- They're so beautiful.
- You want beauty, look in the mirror.

186
00:15:14,643 --> 00:15:16,683
This whole tape is horrible.

187
00:15:17,813 --> 00:15:21,147
It must be, like, a hormone thing.
Every song is making me sick.

188
00:15:21,275 --> 00:15:24,311
I mean, why can't I find
a decent song here?

189
00:15:24,445 --> 00:15:27,980
- That was my favourite.
- Are you deaf?

190
00:15:28,115 --> 00:15:30,115
The house!

191
00:15:30,618 --> 00:15:34,117
Yeah. That's a nice little crib.

192
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,406
I wonder what it's like inside.

193
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,748
Well, what difference does it make?

194
00:15:40,711 --> 00:15:42,751
You know what the really sad thing is?

195
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,043
I bet the people that live there don't
think it's half as pretty as I do.

196
00:15:47,176 --> 00:15:49,133
You know, Andie, I'm just...

197
00:15:49,261 --> 00:15:52,962
They just don't write love songs
like they used to. I...

198
00:15:53,098 --> 00:15:58,175
I'm angry about this now. My evening's
shot. Just drive me home, now.

199
00:17:26,942 --> 00:17:31,355
The reason I came over, other than I'd
been planning to come and say hello,

200
00:17:31,488 --> 00:17:34,988
- I wanted to talk to you about Andie.
- Yeah?

201
00:17:35,117 --> 00:17:37,822
She's an incredible individual.
You know that.

202
00:17:37,953 --> 00:17:41,038
I mean, I'm there for her.
Whenever, however, I'm there.

203
00:17:41,165 --> 00:17:43,288
You can rest assured
that she's covered.

204
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:45,873
I don't want you to worry,
because my only plans

205
00:17:46,003 --> 00:17:48,411
are to make sure
that she's taken care of.

206
00:17:48,547 --> 00:17:50,872
That's nice of you, Phil.

207
00:17:51,008 --> 00:17:53,250
And I'd like to marry her.

208
00:17:53,636 --> 00:17:57,503
Well, not today. But eventually, I figure.

209
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,427
Well, does Andie know
how you feel about this?

210
00:18:02,394 --> 00:18:05,810
No confirmation on that just yet.
I'm layin' the groundwork.

211
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,024
I'm thinkin' in terms of
housing, food, basic needs.

212
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:12,188
But I'm picking my moment.

213
00:18:12,321 --> 00:18:15,073
- I mean, you understand, right?
- Sure.

214
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:18,449
I felt the same way about
somebody myself.

215
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:20,269
A girl?

216
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,480
A girl.

217
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,830
I loved her and I married her.

218
00:18:28,963 --> 00:18:31,086
And one day she just split.

219
00:18:31,257 --> 00:18:33,463
Wait, this was Andie's mom?

220
00:18:34,134 --> 00:18:35,134
Yeah.

221
00:18:37,596 --> 00:18:41,843
So I haven't seen her in three years,
you know, and...

222
00:18:41,976 --> 00:18:47,812
But I still love her
just as much as I ever did, you know?

223
00:18:49,108 --> 00:18:52,524
You can love Andie, but that doesn't
mean she'll love you back.

224
00:18:52,778 --> 00:18:55,483
It doesn't mean she won't, but...

225
00:18:55,614 --> 00:18:58,900
What I'm trying to say is
you can't make it happen.

226
00:18:59,034 --> 00:19:01,360
It either will or it won't.

227
00:19:01,495 --> 00:19:05,623
- It's all in the heart.
- Yeah, sure. Cardiovascular.

228
00:19:05,749 --> 00:19:08,323
Yeah. I understand.
I've been to school.

229
00:19:11,088 --> 00:19:14,789
Well, I got an appointment with
a vacuum cleaner. Gotta go.

230
00:19:14,925 --> 00:19:17,167
You're on a whole
home-improvement jag.

231
00:19:17,303 --> 00:19:21,087
- Yeah. Turning the old life around.
- More power to ya.

232
00:19:21,223 --> 00:19:24,308
If Tina Turner can do it,
Jack Walsh can do it too.

233
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:28,270
Thanks for taking your time.
I really... I appreciate it.

234
00:19:28,397 --> 00:19:31,066
- My pleasure.
- I'm off like a dirty shirt.

235
00:19:34,236 --> 00:19:36,276
Tina Turner.

236
00:19:49,168 --> 00:19:50,168
Hiya.

237
00:19:52,463 --> 00:19:55,583
We just got these glasses in.
They're really...

238
00:19:55,716 --> 00:19:58,088
I didn't like that album
I got the other day.

239
00:19:59,094 --> 00:20:00,094
What?

240
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,223
- The record.
- The record.

241
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:05,388
I thought it was a little too...

242
00:20:05,518 --> 00:20:07,557
Too hip, maybe.

243
00:20:08,604 --> 00:20:12,269
- Yeah, a little too hip.
- Well...

244
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:16,646
Think you can recommend something
else? A little less political?

245
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,355
- Lionel Richie?
- Nah.

246
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:23,142
Well...

247
00:20:23,744 --> 00:20:28,869
- Teena Marie? Madonna?
- Madonna? That's awfully deep.

248
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:32,084
Yeah, very deep.
But she's got such great style.

249
00:20:33,838 --> 00:20:35,638
Listen...

250
00:20:36,632 --> 00:20:39,966
That's the alarm. Can you
hold on a second? I'll be right back.

251
00:20:41,512 --> 00:20:44,548
Here. Read this. It's really good.

252
00:20:47,351 --> 00:20:49,391
What is this?

253
00:20:50,062 --> 00:20:52,102
Hi! How was your day?

254
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,014
Bet it pumps out about
300 decibels, huh?

255
00:20:57,027 --> 00:20:59,316
- Did you do this?
- I'm not sure.

256
00:20:59,446 --> 00:21:02,815
I was just using your powder room
and I decided not to disturb you,

257
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:06,449
so I was gonna go out the back door,
but I must have touched somethin'.

258
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:08,618
- How'd you get in here?
- Are you mad?

259
00:21:08,747 --> 00:21:11,583
Yes, I'm mad! There are
public bathrooms everywhere!

260
00:21:11,709 --> 00:21:13,748
I'm not nine, Andie. I know that.

261
00:21:13,878 --> 00:21:17,081
It's the end of the month.
They're out of toilet-seat covers.

262
00:21:25,848 --> 00:21:29,680
- Blane, what are you doing?
- Hey, buddy. Nothin'. Hangin' out.

263
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:33,678
- What are you shopping for? Records?
- I guess.

264
00:21:33,814 --> 00:21:36,483
- Find anything?
- No, not really.

265
00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:40,108
Are we gonna shoot some trap or
what? If we are, we gotta shake it.

266
00:21:40,362 --> 00:21:43,862
I don't have any place to go. I like
coming here. Excuse me very much.

267
00:21:43,991 --> 00:21:48,119
OK. I'm sorry for getting mad at you.
I gotta get back. See you later.

268
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:03,004
This is a shitty alarm system! I opened
the door five times before it rang.

269
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:07,133
That's it! I'm leaving.
I'm not gonna stay here. No! No way!

270
00:22:32,623 --> 00:22:35,956
Hi. It's 6.05. Duckie Dale. Give me a call.

271
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:42,038
6.15. Duckie Dale again. Call me, OK?

272
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:47,879
Andie, where are you? This is the Duck.
Give me a call, OK?

273
00:22:50,307 --> 00:22:52,264
It's 6.28...

274
00:22:52,393 --> 00:22:55,394
Please call. Please, please, please.

275
00:22:57,273 --> 00:23:00,108
This is Duckie. Are you really home
and not picking up?

276
00:23:00,234 --> 00:23:02,440
Cos if so, I feel like
a giant asshole here.

277
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,609
It's 6.31. Give me a call, OK?

278
00:23:10,035 --> 00:23:12,787
Duckie, I'll talk to you
in the morning. Bye.

279
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:53,278
- Why are you up? I didn't wake you yet.
- I'm fixing you breakfast.

280
00:23:53,412 --> 00:23:56,081
One egg over medium,
and I fed the dog.

281
00:23:56,207 --> 00:23:58,828
- Did Daddy feed you, hm?
- Your egg, madame.

282
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:01,450
I don't eat eggs, Daddy.
Why don't you eat it?

283
00:24:01,587 --> 00:24:04,541
- I'll bring you your coffee and juice.
- OK.

284
00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:11,001
- Since when don't you like eggs?
- Since about birth. Don't worry about it.

285
00:24:11,138 --> 00:24:14,472
- You never told me why you were up.
- It's morning.

286
00:24:15,476 --> 00:24:18,145
You mean why didn't you
have to drag my ass out of bed?

287
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,270
OK.

288
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,638
Well, I got a job.

289
00:24:21,774 --> 00:24:24,485
- No?
- Yeah.

290
00:24:25,152 --> 00:24:29,280
- Where?
- Well, I'll tell you after I start.

291
00:24:30,908 --> 00:24:33,778
- When's that?
- Soon.

292
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:38,405
- I'm so proud of you. You got the job.
- No big deal.

293
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:41,707
Yes, it is a big deal.
It's a very big deal.

294
00:24:41,836 --> 00:24:44,373
Listen, I gotta go.
I'm gonna be late for school.

295
00:24:44,505 --> 00:24:48,419
- Tell me all about it tonight.
- All right. It'll be real good.

296
00:25:12,825 --> 00:25:14,625
Hi, guys.

297
00:25:17,329 --> 00:25:20,414
- How you doin'?
- Fine. You?

298
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:23,032
I'm OK. And you?

299
00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:26,169
- Well, I just said I was fine.
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

300
00:25:29,383 --> 00:25:32,218
- So, is this your first time out here?
- Yeah.

301
00:25:32,803 --> 00:25:35,472
I don't think I'm very popular
out here either.

302
00:25:35,598 --> 00:25:38,433
I dunno. You're just fine inside.

303
00:25:39,685 --> 00:25:43,184
I don't know. I'm not really
into all this shit, you know?

304
00:25:43,314 --> 00:25:44,314
Yeah.

305
00:25:45,858 --> 00:25:46,858
Yeah.

306
00:25:50,946 --> 00:25:53,235
I really liked your computer trick.

307
00:25:53,365 --> 00:25:56,900
- Clever, huh?
- Terribly clever, yeah. Terribly.

308
00:26:01,624 --> 00:26:04,827
- Are you late for something?
- Yeah, I am, as a matter of fact.

309
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,000
But it's no big deal.

310
00:26:08,923 --> 00:26:12,837
Listen, do you wanna go out Friday?

311
00:26:12,968 --> 00:26:13,968
Yeah.

312
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,844
- Yeah?
- Sure.

313
00:26:16,972 --> 00:26:18,597
Yeah? OK!

314
00:26:18,724 --> 00:26:21,393
- Seven o'clock OK?
- Yeah, that's fine.

315
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:24,188
Great. Where do you live?
I'll pick you up.

316
00:26:26,315 --> 00:26:29,269
- Where do you live?
- No, I'm sorry.

317
00:26:29,401 --> 00:26:32,486
I'll be working on Friday,
so just pick me up at the mall.

318
00:26:32,613 --> 00:26:33,650
- OK.
- OK.

319
00:26:33,755 --> 00:26:35,779
- Bye.
- See you.

320
00:26:48,629 --> 00:26:51,298
Hey, Blane. How you doin'?

321
00:26:51,423 --> 00:26:53,463
Hey, buddy. What's up?

322
00:26:53,592 --> 00:26:56,000
- What are you up to?
- Not much, going to class.

323
00:26:56,136 --> 00:26:58,094
Well, I saw you outside.

324
00:26:58,222 --> 00:27:01,389
- So?
- So, what were you doing?

325
00:27:01,517 --> 00:27:05,301
What are you? My mother?
Come on, I gotta go. I'll see you later.

326
00:27:05,437 --> 00:27:07,395
- Blane, what's goin' on?
- Nothing.

327
00:27:07,523 --> 00:27:11,936
Well, not nothing. I saw you talking
to that chick, what's her name, Eddie?

328
00:27:12,653 --> 00:27:16,733
- So what do you care?
- My best friend is talking to a mutant.

329
00:27:16,866 --> 00:27:20,069
I'm curious.
That's no reason to get defensive.

330
00:27:20,202 --> 00:27:23,452
I'm not defensive.
I just happen to like her, all right?

331
00:27:23,581 --> 00:27:27,365
Listen, all right. It's your life.
It's none of my business.

332
00:27:27,501 --> 00:27:30,206
You really don't think
she's got something?

333
00:27:30,337 --> 00:27:33,920
No. I really don't. I'm sorry.

334
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:37,799
You're gonna be late, buddy.

335
00:27:46,187 --> 00:27:49,022
The Warsaw Pact was a treaty
signed by the Soviet Union

336
00:27:49,148 --> 00:27:51,603
and seven East European satellites.

337
00:27:51,734 --> 00:27:54,106
What it did was it...

338
00:27:54,236 --> 00:27:57,071
it established a mutual
defence organisation as...

339
00:27:57,198 --> 00:27:58,240
Duckie!

340
00:27:58,365 --> 00:28:02,363
What? What, what? Well, what'd I put?

341
00:28:02,494 --> 00:28:06,907
You wrote "The Warsaw Pact is the
pact that was named after Warsaw."

342
00:28:08,709 --> 00:28:11,034
The teacher'll know you're bullshitting.

343
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:13,743
OK, OK. What about the rest of it?

344
00:28:13,881 --> 00:28:16,751
The Russian Revolution
did not take place in Germany.

345
00:28:18,052 --> 00:28:20,507
- What was Karl Marx, then?
- He was a German.

346
00:28:20,804 --> 00:28:23,509
- Well, there you go.
- Yes, but his being German

347
00:28:23,641 --> 00:28:27,306
has nothing to do with where
the Russian Revolution occurred!

348
00:28:27,436 --> 00:28:28,836
OK, OK.

349
00:28:31,941 --> 00:28:35,808
OK, can I propose something to you
without you getting upset or angry?

350
00:28:35,945 --> 00:28:38,400
- That depends.
- On what?

351
00:28:38,531 --> 00:28:41,448
I dunno. I just said that. Go ahead.

352
00:28:41,867 --> 00:28:46,197
You're deliberately flunking your
courses so you can stay in high school.

353
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:48,702
Get out of here! Why would I do that?

354
00:28:48,832 --> 00:28:53,293
- I dunno. You tell me.
- Well, I'm not, so there's nothing to tell.

355
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:57,549
- You're not always one to face things.
- What am I not facing?

356
00:28:57,675 --> 00:28:58,754
The future.

357
00:28:58,884 --> 00:29:02,549
Whether or not you face the future,
it happens, right?

358
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,846
- You run yourself down. Why?
- I am not running myself down!

359
00:29:05,975 --> 00:29:08,382
You think I am? I don't think I am.

360
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:11,804
Why? Because of the way I dress?
Cos I can laugh at myself?

361
00:29:11,939 --> 00:29:16,186
That's called a sense of humour.
You should get one, they're nice.

362
00:29:16,318 --> 00:29:19,853
- What are we gonna do next year?
- You think I'll still be in school.

363
00:29:19,989 --> 00:29:22,990
I'm serious! Not a day
has passed in eight years

364
00:29:23,117 --> 00:29:25,323
when I didn't talk to you
at least 20 times!

365
00:29:25,452 --> 00:29:27,741
Well, that's devotion.

366
00:29:28,205 --> 00:29:31,989
I know. Even if I sometimes get angry,
you know that I secretly love it.

367
00:29:32,126 --> 00:29:34,878
You see, I knew that.

368
00:29:35,004 --> 00:29:38,337
I hope I'm not the only one
that knows how incredible you are.

369
00:29:38,465 --> 00:29:41,917
Well, at this point in time,
I'm afraid you are, honey.

370
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:46,388
I'm gonna get something to drink,
and then we work, OK?

371
00:29:46,515 --> 00:29:48,923
- You bet.
- OK. What do you want?

372
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:52,263
- Beer, Scotch, juice box. Whatever.
- OK.

373
00:29:57,318 --> 00:29:58,918
Oh, God.

374
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:02,437
I love this woman.

375
00:30:02,573 --> 00:30:05,443
I love this woman and I have to tell her,

376
00:30:06,076 --> 00:30:08,947
and if she laughs, she laughs.

377
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:12,614
And if she doesn't love me,
she doesn't love me,

378
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,371
but if I don't find out...

379
00:30:16,795 --> 00:30:19,002
I love her too much!

380
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,005
Love is real.

381
00:30:29,767 --> 00:30:31,344
Thank you, thank you.

382
00:30:31,477 --> 00:30:33,516
Real is love.

383
00:30:33,646 --> 00:30:36,137
You're a wonderful crowd here,
you know that.

384
00:30:36,273 --> 00:30:38,313
Love is living

385
00:30:42,154 --> 00:30:45,689
You're fabulous. I do love you.
You're gorgeous, I love your hair.

386
00:30:45,824 --> 00:30:48,824
Love is feeling

387
00:30:49,954 --> 00:30:52,354
Feeling love

388
00:30:53,415 --> 00:30:56,333
Love is wanting

389
00:30:59,713 --> 00:31:04,541
She's gonna laugh. Would I blame her?

390
00:31:06,178 --> 00:31:09,298
- There you go.
- Thanks, but I'm gonna split.

391
00:31:09,431 --> 00:31:12,931
- Why? What about your paper?
- That's what I'm gonna do.

392
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:17,140
If you help me, thanks a lot, but
it won't be my work, it'll be bogus.

393
00:31:17,273 --> 00:31:19,396
And I guess I'll see you in the a.m.

394
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:25,359
Drinking and driving don't mix.
That's why I ride a bike.

395
00:31:45,092 --> 00:31:47,132
So, are you going out this weekend?

396
00:31:47,261 --> 00:31:49,550
I dunno. I'm not sure yet.

397
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,673
- What are you gonna do?
- Stay at home.

398
00:31:51,807 --> 00:31:55,852
- Yeah? Are you gonna study again?
- Probably. Would you put that out?

399
00:31:55,978 --> 00:31:59,643
Why do you study so much? It makes
me ill. I just don't see the point.

400
00:31:59,773 --> 00:32:02,525
No? I don't wanna work
in a record store my whole life.

401
00:32:02,651 --> 00:32:05,438
What do you wanna be? A doctor?

402
00:32:05,571 --> 00:32:07,171
Oh, God.

403
00:32:08,908 --> 00:32:12,988
OK, let's go, everybody.
Get in your lines, please! Thank you.

404
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,528
- Vormeister!
- Here!

405
00:32:15,664 --> 00:32:17,264
Bassett!

406
00:32:18,626 --> 00:32:21,330
- Bassano
- Yeah!

407
00:32:22,087 --> 00:32:26,833
- Look. Watch out.
- Do we smell bad or something?

408
00:32:26,967 --> 00:32:28,167
Benny.

409
00:32:30,012 --> 00:32:32,384
I hope they shrivel up and fall off, OK?

410
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:36,139
What was that, Miss Homan?

411
00:32:38,145 --> 00:32:40,601
I said "I hope they shrivel up
and fall off'.

412
00:32:42,525 --> 00:32:44,813
You hope what shrivels up
and falls off?

413
00:32:45,528 --> 00:32:47,567
Her breasts, Miss Dietz.

414
00:32:47,696 --> 00:32:49,321
- Shut up!
- I'm sorry.

415
00:32:51,408 --> 00:32:53,531
You are outta here, Homan.

416
00:32:53,661 --> 00:32:54,861
Right.

417
00:32:55,204 --> 00:32:56,579
Bye-bye.

418
00:32:56,705 --> 00:32:58,248
Bye, girls.

419
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:04,830
So, do you share
your partner's attitude?

420
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,416
No, I don't.

421
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,480
Eat shit.

422
00:33:17,101 --> 00:33:18,678
Excuse me, Miss Dietz.

423
00:33:18,811 --> 00:33:21,053
You've only got a couple of months left.

424
00:33:21,188 --> 00:33:23,810
You're doing extremely well
in your courses,

425
00:33:23,941 --> 00:33:27,725
and I think your chances of
getting a scholarship are excellent.

426
00:33:27,862 --> 00:33:31,313
- I know this, Mr Donnelly.
- Why are you in here now?

427
00:33:31,448 --> 00:33:34,319
I don't know. I guess
I just got a little fed up.

428
00:33:34,451 --> 00:33:37,488
- With what?
- The way that we get treated.

429
00:33:39,456 --> 00:33:43,786
Look, you're getting
a topnotch education here

430
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,004
and I just don't want
to see you throw it away.

431
00:33:47,506 --> 00:33:49,962
I'm getting a better education
than I deserve.

432
00:33:50,092 --> 00:33:54,006
I'm lucky, the good people of this
community allow me to attend here.

433
00:33:54,138 --> 00:33:57,970
- Again, you are misunderstanding me.
- No, I understand everything.

434
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,635
I don't need to have it
explained to me. I live it.

435
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:05,602
It's just, sometimes, I get
a little upset and I lose my temper.

436
00:34:05,733 --> 00:34:10,525
I don't like to see my friends getting
punished for defending themselves.

437
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:16,817
Well, we'll just forget
about this whole thing, OK?

438
00:34:17,912 --> 00:34:18,912
OK.

439
00:34:21,707 --> 00:34:23,830
What about Jena?

440
00:34:23,959 --> 00:34:27,209
- She's off too.
- Thank you.

441
00:34:28,464 --> 00:34:29,664
Andie,

442
00:34:30,883 --> 00:34:34,299
if you put out signals
that you don't wanna belong,

443
00:34:34,428 --> 00:34:37,097
people are gonna
make sure that you don't.

444
00:34:37,223 --> 00:34:39,262
That's a beautiful theory.

445
00:34:40,935 --> 00:34:42,345
Andie! Andie!

446
00:34:42,478 --> 00:34:46,262
I heard what happened and I came
as best I could. I cut out of Home Ec.

447
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:48,438
- Was it really bad?
- No, it was nothing.

448
00:34:48,567 --> 00:34:49,943
- Are you upset?
- No.

449
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:53,023
Yes, yes, you are, I can tell.
Your eyes get all squinty.

450
00:34:53,155 --> 00:34:55,777
- I know how to make you feel better.
- I feel fine!

451
00:34:55,908 --> 00:34:59,277
I wanna take you away
this weekend. Do you fish?

452
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:03,071
- OK, we can go right now.
- I have class!

453
00:35:03,207 --> 00:35:06,790
- Tonight. I won't take no for an answer.
- Try, please.

454
00:35:06,919 --> 00:35:10,619
This woman is suffering inside.
That's all there is to it.

455
00:35:12,424 --> 00:35:15,425
Yo, man. Next time, I'll kick your ass.
That'll be that.

456
00:35:15,553 --> 00:35:17,592
I'm just kidding. It's a joke.

457
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:20,964
How about that stock market?

458
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,673
My broker is EF Hutton,
and EF Hutton says...

459
00:35:23,811 --> 00:35:27,595
You see, it never works.
I've never seen it work.

460
00:35:28,899 --> 00:35:29,899
Shit!

461
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,820
So this is what it looks like!

462
00:35:38,033 --> 00:35:40,951
This is great!
Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait.

463
00:35:41,078 --> 00:35:44,162
You got doors on the stalls.
They're not stuck.

464
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:48,501
Wait a minute! We don't have
none of this stuff in the boys' room!

465
00:35:48,627 --> 00:35:50,953
We don't have doors on the stalls...

466
00:35:51,088 --> 00:35:53,544
What is this?
We don't have a candy machine.

467
00:35:53,674 --> 00:35:56,343
- None of that.
- Who is that screaming?

468
00:35:56,468 --> 00:35:59,968
I'm sorry. I want the Principal
here this instant. Now.

469
00:36:00,097 --> 00:36:02,802
This instant. I'll wait. Thank you.

470
00:36:14,403 --> 00:36:17,155
Shit! Why can't I do this?

471
00:36:19,366 --> 00:36:23,234
What have you done?
This... You have to subtotal first.

472
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:26,205
I tell you this every time.
You never listen.

473
00:36:26,624 --> 00:36:30,918
One more tune, then it's off
to enjoy a terrible relationship.

474
00:36:32,421 --> 00:36:34,994
The guy next door loves this.

475
00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:31,152
Evening, young ladies.
This is a very good tune.

476
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:33,698
My mother used to sing this. I love Otis.

477
00:38:33,834 --> 00:38:35,328
We're closed.

478
00:38:35,461 --> 00:38:38,331
- Know what older women do for me?
- Change your diapers?

479
00:38:38,464 --> 00:38:40,836
Touché. You're a very
smoky alternative,

480
00:38:40,966 --> 00:38:43,588
but this is the Duck Man's love in life.

481
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:45,842
- Shall we?
- Ever had one of these?

482
00:38:47,139 --> 00:38:49,096
I don't think so.

483
00:38:50,392 --> 00:38:53,062
Come on! Let's plough!

484
00:38:59,026 --> 00:39:00,935
Do I offend?

485
00:39:04,156 --> 00:39:06,279
Andie, hon!

486
00:39:06,408 --> 00:39:11,154
Listen. It's after seven.
Don't waste good lip gloss.

487
00:39:11,288 --> 00:39:14,491
- I know, Iona.
- I don't mean to be a bitch or anything,

488
00:39:14,625 --> 00:39:18,160
but I don't think
Mr Wonderful's gonna happen tonight.

489
00:39:21,715 --> 00:39:23,708
I don't know what I'm doing.

490
00:39:23,843 --> 00:39:25,882
Wishful make-upping.

491
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:31,266
Wait. You babes are talking
a sign language

492
00:39:31,392 --> 00:39:34,179
that the old Ducker here
just does not understand.

493
00:39:34,311 --> 00:39:37,063
Would you mind filling me in?
I'm a little confused.

494
00:39:37,189 --> 00:39:39,229
She got stood up, twerp!

495
00:39:40,317 --> 00:39:42,559
Stood up? How so? Wait, I'm here!

496
00:39:42,945 --> 00:39:46,693
Is this one of those feminine
mystique deals or something?

497
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:51,910
He showed.

498
00:39:56,834 --> 00:39:58,034
Andie.

499
00:40:06,594 --> 00:40:08,633
I'll get that.

500
00:40:12,099 --> 00:40:15,433
- Duckie, I'm really sorry.
- Is this...

501
00:40:15,561 --> 00:40:19,309
You're gonna go out with this guy?
Is this, like, a date?

502
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,765
Yeah. I mean, you'd like him.

503
00:40:21,901 --> 00:40:24,652
He's not like the other guys.
Seriously.

504
00:40:24,778 --> 00:40:26,818
No. No way. Andie!

505
00:40:28,157 --> 00:40:32,368
You've really pissed me off cos they
shit all over everybody, including you.

506
00:40:32,828 --> 00:40:37,157
- I can't believe you'd be this stupid.
- I'm not gonna let anybody shit on me.

507
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,414
He's gonna use your ass and throw you
away. God, I would have died for you!

508
00:40:41,545 --> 00:40:44,167
So what am I supposed to do?
He asked me out and I like him.

509
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,673
If I hate him because he's got money,

510
00:40:47,801 --> 00:40:51,669
that's the same thing as them hating us
because we don't. Understand?

511
00:40:51,805 --> 00:40:54,676
You can't do this and respect yourself.

512
00:40:54,808 --> 00:40:57,845
- You can't.
- I'll make that decision, all right?

513
00:40:57,978 --> 00:40:59,935
Sure, you can do what you want!

514
00:41:00,064 --> 00:41:03,018
You're saying that
just because I'm going out with Blane.

515
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,024
Blane? His name is Blane?

516
00:41:05,694 --> 00:41:08,364
That's a major appliance!
That's not a name!

517
00:41:08,489 --> 00:41:12,273
Just because I'm going out with Blane
doesn't mean I can't be your friend.

518
00:41:12,409 --> 00:41:15,944
- It doesn't change how I feel about you.
- That's very nice.

519
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,203
I'm glad. Here's the point, Andie.

520
00:41:18,332 --> 00:41:21,997
I'm not particularly concerned
with whether or not you like me.

521
00:41:22,127 --> 00:41:25,662
Cos I live to like you,
and I can't like you any more.

522
00:41:27,424 --> 00:41:31,588
So when you get your heart splattered
all over hell and you feel low, and dirty,

523
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,303
don't look to me to help
pump you back up cos...

524
00:41:35,432 --> 00:41:39,347
cos maybe for the first time
in your life, I won't be there.

525
00:41:39,478 --> 00:41:42,147
I can't believe
you're actually saying this.

526
00:41:42,273 --> 00:41:44,728
Well, I guess that's just tough shit.

527
00:41:52,825 --> 00:41:54,864
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

528
00:42:06,672 --> 00:42:09,424
- That guy in the store...
- He was a friend of mine.

529
00:42:09,592 --> 00:42:13,008
I've known him since I was a kid.
He's a really nice guy.

530
00:42:13,137 --> 00:42:15,176
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I like him a lot.

531
00:42:16,307 --> 00:42:18,346
So, you wanna go home and change?

532
00:42:20,436 --> 00:42:22,725
I already did.

533
00:42:22,855 --> 00:42:24,894
- Sorry.
- That's OK.

534
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,647
So, where are we going?

535
00:42:31,697 --> 00:42:33,939
You up for a party?

536
00:42:34,074 --> 00:42:36,316
Yeah? No? Maybe?

537
00:42:36,452 --> 00:42:38,491
No, I don't think so.

538
00:42:40,331 --> 00:42:42,288
- Why?
- Why?

539
00:42:42,416 --> 00:42:44,954
- They're my friends. It's OK.
- Your friends.

540
00:42:45,085 --> 00:42:47,623
I wouldn't go
if I didn't think they'd accept you.

541
00:42:47,755 --> 00:42:49,747
Can't we go somewhere else?

542
00:42:49,882 --> 00:42:52,966
Andie, I like you. I think you like me.

543
00:42:53,093 --> 00:42:56,379
We know a lot of bullshit goes on,
but if you're above it, I am.

544
00:42:56,514 --> 00:43:00,642
If we want to make anything out of this,
we gotta deal with it, right?

545
00:43:00,768 --> 00:43:03,473
- Yeah.
- Come on, I got as much to lose as you.

546
00:43:03,604 --> 00:43:07,602
We can go out with your friends if you
want. We could go crawl under a rock.

547
00:43:07,733 --> 00:43:10,817
Anything you want. The choice is yours.

548
00:43:10,945 --> 00:43:14,278
- We could go hang-gliding.
- I've never been hang-gliding.

549
00:43:14,406 --> 00:43:17,277
Well, there's a first for everything.

550
00:43:17,409 --> 00:43:18,987
If it's a bad time, we leave.

551
00:43:57,658 --> 00:43:59,734
- Hi, Blane.
- Hey, Eddie.

552
00:44:13,757 --> 00:44:15,964
Aren't you the girl in my art class?

553
00:44:16,886 --> 00:44:20,301
Nice pearls.
This isn't a dinner party, honey.

554
00:44:20,431 --> 00:44:21,468
Watch it.

555
00:44:21,573 --> 00:44:24,677
- Hey, Blane. How you doin'?
- Hey, Kev, what's up?

556
00:44:55,257 --> 00:44:58,211
I can't believe I actually
associate with these people.

557
00:44:58,344 --> 00:45:00,632
I can't believe that I'm actually here.

558
00:45:00,763 --> 00:45:04,132
- Pretty bad, yeah?
- Yeah, it's pretty bad.

559
00:45:05,476 --> 00:45:07,136
I'm sorry.

560
00:45:07,269 --> 00:45:09,309
Let's go upstairs, huh?

561
00:45:11,899 --> 00:45:13,274
Come on.

562
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,769
I didn't come here to get you off.
That was not my idea.

563
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:22,157
That's not what I meant.
I haven't even tried to kiss you, have I?

564
00:45:22,284 --> 00:45:24,906
Look, it's quieter up there, OK?

565
00:45:25,037 --> 00:45:29,201
Come on. These hands will remain
in these pockets, I swear to God.

566
00:45:38,551 --> 00:45:42,251
Look at me here. Come on.
I'm utterly defenceless.

567
00:45:42,388 --> 00:45:44,427
And utterly foolish. Come on.

568
00:45:48,102 --> 00:45:51,553
- What do you think of these carpets?
- They're fab.

569
00:45:58,404 --> 00:46:00,527
This is gonna be great.

570
00:46:00,656 --> 00:46:02,814
- Hey, Blane.
- Steff.

571
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:04,777
- How you doin'?
- All right.

572
00:46:04,952 --> 00:46:07,241
- I'll get another room.
- No, come on in.

573
00:46:07,371 --> 00:46:09,660
I'm just watching some 'toons here.

574
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:12,747
Who you got with you here, Blane?

575
00:46:13,377 --> 00:46:16,046
Andie, this is Steff. Steff, Andie.

576
00:46:17,506 --> 00:46:20,709
It's very nice to meet you, Andie.

577
00:46:21,135 --> 00:46:24,670
Listen, you wanna come sit down?
Or you want the bed?

578
00:46:24,805 --> 00:46:27,094
No! No, we're fine.

579
00:46:27,224 --> 00:46:29,762
Come and have a drink.
Can I get you something?

580
00:46:29,894 --> 00:46:33,345
This is my last serious party
of my high school career.

581
00:46:34,356 --> 00:46:39,149
Hope you guys are gonna tough it out
until Sunday when my folks get home.

582
00:46:39,278 --> 00:46:43,489
I think this one may just finally
kill the old son of a bitch, Blane.

583
00:46:43,616 --> 00:46:47,234
Another giant step away from virginity.

584
00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:50,039
You're a slut, aren't you, Benny?

585
00:47:00,966 --> 00:47:03,006
Oh, my God.

586
00:47:03,844 --> 00:47:07,296
- Am I having a nightmare?
- We got guests.

587
00:47:07,431 --> 00:47:11,132
I know you. You're in my calculus class.

588
00:47:11,268 --> 00:47:13,640
- Gym.
- Your name's Jim?

589
00:47:13,771 --> 00:47:16,522
You are worthless, aren't you?

590
00:47:16,649 --> 00:47:20,065
You and your friends gave me
a lot of shit the other day.

591
00:47:20,194 --> 00:47:23,563
- Take it easy, Benny, huh?
- This is Steffs party, Blane.

592
00:47:23,697 --> 00:47:26,449
- Don't tell me what to do.
- Steff...

593
00:47:26,784 --> 00:47:29,654
You shouldn't be allowed
to invite just anybody.

594
00:47:30,704 --> 00:47:33,741
Steff, she's gonna ruin my night.

595
00:47:33,874 --> 00:47:36,994
- Shut up, Benny.
- You're a faggot, Blane.

596
00:47:37,127 --> 00:47:39,963
OK, listen, Benny.

597
00:47:40,089 --> 00:47:42,876
- Listen, why don't we just...
- Where are you going?

598
00:47:43,008 --> 00:47:45,796
- Let's just leave them with the room...
- Why?

599
00:47:45,928 --> 00:47:49,214
...and we will get you something to eat.
- You've got what I want.

600
00:47:49,348 --> 00:47:51,388
...ribs or something.

601
00:47:51,517 --> 00:47:56,973
Listen, you guys enjoy yourselves
and we'll see you later, maybe.

602
00:47:57,273 --> 00:47:58,352
I doubt it.

603
00:47:58,482 --> 00:48:00,190
- You all right?
- Fine.

604
00:48:00,317 --> 00:48:04,066
You're an asshole.
And I don't wanna know what you are.

605
00:48:04,196 --> 00:48:08,360
I'm gonna take her to throw up
somewhere. Enjoy yourself, Blane.

606
00:48:10,077 --> 00:48:14,157
They're kinda jerks when
they drink, huh? Bad idea.

607
00:48:14,707 --> 00:48:17,411
Can you just get me out of here now?

608
00:48:18,169 --> 00:48:19,169
Yeah.

609
00:48:20,004 --> 00:48:22,625
I don't wanna take you home.
I'd like to be with you.

610
00:48:22,756 --> 00:48:26,256
If not here, somewhere else.
Anywhere you want.

611
00:48:27,845 --> 00:48:30,134
I'm sorry. What can I say?
I made a mistake.

612
00:48:30,264 --> 00:48:32,755
I overestimated my friends. I'm sorry.

613
00:48:35,853 --> 00:48:39,685
- What, do you wanna hit me?
- Yes, I do.

614
00:48:40,357 --> 00:48:42,231
Be my guest.

615
00:49:10,804 --> 00:49:12,844
You wanna know my thing?

616
00:49:14,016 --> 00:49:16,934
If I really have it solid for a girl,

617
00:49:17,061 --> 00:49:20,430
I'll ride by her house on my bike.

618
00:49:21,315 --> 00:49:24,565
I'll do it, like, a hundred times in a day.

619
00:49:24,693 --> 00:49:27,231
It's really... it's intense.

620
00:49:27,363 --> 00:49:29,984
Do you ever park?

621
00:49:30,115 --> 00:49:32,238
I'm kind of a drive-by kind of guy.

622
00:49:43,462 --> 00:49:45,087
Do you want a drink?

623
00:49:45,214 --> 00:49:46,251
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

624
00:49:46,356 --> 00:49:48,712
- Coke.
- Coke? OK.

625
00:49:49,426 --> 00:49:53,471
Give me your address.
I'll put you on my round.

626
00:49:57,393 --> 00:50:00,228
OK, you're gonna have
to help me out here.

627
00:50:00,354 --> 00:50:03,937
You know, some day that girl's
gonna realise just what she missed.

628
00:50:06,527 --> 00:50:09,777
Come on, don't stop! Gimme more!

629
00:50:11,532 --> 00:50:13,571
- Hi!
- Hi.

630
00:50:14,201 --> 00:50:17,487
- Prince Charming wimp out?
- No. No, he's at the bar.

631
00:50:19,707 --> 00:50:21,107
Duckie.

632
00:50:23,043 --> 00:50:24,703
He's sulking.

633
00:50:24,837 --> 00:50:29,084
He's not gonna ride his bike
past your house any more.

634
00:50:29,216 --> 00:50:32,003
Duckie, you're being a real jerk.

635
00:50:35,264 --> 00:50:37,506
How'd he get in here, anyway?

636
00:50:38,809 --> 00:50:43,103
- I said he was my kid.
- How come you're here?

637
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:45,935
I've been trying to figure
that out all night.

638
00:50:51,947 --> 00:50:53,904
- Sorry.
- Mom make this for you?

639
00:50:54,033 --> 00:50:55,990
Yeah. Gross, huh?

640
00:50:56,869 --> 00:50:58,869
Excuse me.

641
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,248
- Hi.
- There you go.

642
00:51:12,384 --> 00:51:15,172
- You met Iona, didn't you?
- Not formally. Hi. Blane.

643
00:51:15,304 --> 00:51:18,091
And that's Duckie Dale
over there behind the glasses.

644
00:51:18,224 --> 00:51:20,893
- Hi, Duckie.
- Phillip F Dale to you, scumwad.

645
00:51:23,395 --> 00:51:25,435
So where have you guys been?

646
00:51:26,398 --> 00:51:30,147
- A friend of mine was having a party.
- How adorable!

647
00:51:31,862 --> 00:51:36,489
- Yeah. It was a little intense.
- You had an intense party?

648
00:51:37,701 --> 00:51:41,995
- No, it was a friend of mine's, I said.
- Duckie, shut up.

649
00:51:44,083 --> 00:51:47,499
- What's the problem?
- This is a classic piece of work here.

650
00:51:47,628 --> 00:51:49,502
- Duckie, please!
- Phil.

651
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:53,710
Phil, I think you're making Andie
uncomfortable. Just knock it off.

652
00:51:53,843 --> 00:51:57,627
I devoted my life to the girl and he
comes along and thinks he knows her.

653
00:51:57,763 --> 00:52:00,883
You should call David Letterman.
He'd book you in a minute.

654
00:52:01,016 --> 00:52:03,258
Phil, would you like us to leave?

655
00:52:03,435 --> 00:52:06,009
Yes, very perceptive.

656
00:52:06,146 --> 00:52:07,724
Come on.

657
00:52:08,774 --> 00:52:11,609
Look at the manners on this guy!
This was a treat!

658
00:52:11,735 --> 00:52:13,775
You're a great couple of kids, really.

659
00:52:13,904 --> 00:52:17,819
I can't believe I actually felt bad
for you tonight, retarded little dwarf!

660
00:52:18,868 --> 00:52:20,468
See you.

661
00:52:20,703 --> 00:52:23,372
Nice meeting you. See ya later.

662
00:52:23,998 --> 00:52:25,160
- Sorry.
- No problem.

663
00:52:25,666 --> 00:52:27,409
- No problem.
- Asshole.

664
00:52:27,543 --> 00:52:30,497
Blow me, buttwad. From you,
I'd take it as a compliment.

665
00:52:30,629 --> 00:52:32,586
Andie! Yo!

666
00:52:37,011 --> 00:52:39,050
You've been replaced.

667
00:52:44,059 --> 00:52:46,059
I'm sorry.

668
00:53:04,038 --> 00:53:06,161
Well, what now?

669
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:09,873
I gotta get up early.
Why don't we just forget it?

670
00:53:10,002 --> 00:53:12,042
What, home?

671
00:53:13,881 --> 00:53:17,961
- Hey, you wanna go to my house?
- No, thanks.

672
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:22,387
- You wanna eat?
- No.

673
00:53:22,515 --> 00:53:25,219
What do you wanna do? Anything.

674
00:53:27,436 --> 00:53:29,974
Why don't you just drop me off at Trax...

675
00:53:30,105 --> 00:53:32,063
- Trax?
- It's real close to home.

676
00:53:32,191 --> 00:53:36,058
- It's late. I'll just drop you home.
- I have something I have to do there.

677
00:53:36,195 --> 00:53:39,196
Now? It's late.
You wanna go home, I'll drop you home.

678
00:53:39,323 --> 00:53:43,534
- I don't want you to take me home.
- OK, let's go out. Anything you want.

679
00:53:43,661 --> 00:53:46,496
- I don't wanna go out.
- And you don't wanna go home.

680
00:53:46,622 --> 00:53:50,205
- What do you wanna do?
- I don't want you to take me home.

681
00:53:50,334 --> 00:53:52,742
I'm missing something.
I don't understand...

682
00:53:52,878 --> 00:53:56,045
- Wait a minute. Don't walk away.
- Don't! I just don't want...

683
00:53:56,173 --> 00:53:58,166
- Don't you understand?
- No, I don't.

684
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:00,672
Listen to me.
I don't want you to take me home.

685
00:54:00,803 --> 00:54:02,842
OK. Why? What is the problem?

686
00:54:03,889 --> 00:54:06,676
Because I don't want you
to see where I live, OK?

687
00:54:06,809 --> 00:54:09,561
- What?
- I'm sorry. Forget it.

688
00:54:13,399 --> 00:54:15,438
Jesus Christ.

689
00:54:46,348 --> 00:54:48,590
I'm sorry for bumming out
the night for you.

690
00:54:48,726 --> 00:54:51,643
You didn't bum out anything.
I had a great time.

691
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:55,222
- You liar.
- I was with you. I had a great time.

692
00:54:55,691 --> 00:54:59,819
If I was in a Turkish prison,
I'd have a great time with you.

693
00:54:59,945 --> 00:55:03,860
I don't know. It's just too weird for me.
Maybe this shouldn't happen.

694
00:55:03,991 --> 00:55:06,031
What - you and me?

695
00:55:06,785 --> 00:55:11,744
Well, maybe it doesn't happen all the
time, but it doesn't mean it isn't right.

696
00:55:12,541 --> 00:55:14,748
Doesn't mean we can't try.

697
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:22,175
Feel any better
if I asked you to the prom?

698
00:55:24,386 --> 00:55:28,170
I know the prom's kinda lame, so if
you don't wanna go, it's no big deal...

699
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:04,550
Hey! What?

700
00:56:04,885 --> 00:56:08,052
It happened. He asked me.

701
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:10,636
- And?
- I accepted.

702
00:56:10,766 --> 00:56:12,675
Well, congratulations.

703
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:17,057
No more moping around the house
waiting for the telephone to ring.

704
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:20,098
So, are you in love?

705
00:56:23,487 --> 00:56:26,358
- Yeah, I think I am.
- Well, who is this guy?

706
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:30,817
His name's Blane, and he's a senior.
He's so beautiful.

707
00:56:32,872 --> 00:56:35,244
He's a richie.

708
00:56:35,875 --> 00:56:39,125
- A what-ie?
- A richie. It's kinda stupid.

709
00:56:39,253 --> 00:56:41,625
It's just his family has a lot of money.

710
00:56:41,755 --> 00:56:44,875
- Well, is that a problem?
- I don't know, it's just weird.

711
00:56:45,009 --> 00:56:47,963
His friends have a lot of money
and he has a lot of money.

712
00:56:48,095 --> 00:56:50,503
He drives a BMW.

713
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:55,182
I just... I don't know... I'm not
really sure if they're gonna accept me.

714
00:56:55,311 --> 00:56:59,308
What does that mean?
You like him, he likes you.

715
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,145
What his friends think
shouldn't make a difference.

716
00:57:02,276 --> 00:57:05,028
Yeah, but it's my friends too.
It's everybody.

717
00:57:05,154 --> 00:57:07,692
I'm just not real secure about it.

718
00:57:08,282 --> 00:57:10,405
Well, so take the heat.

719
00:57:10,534 --> 00:57:13,108
You like him, he likes you.
It's worth it.

720
00:57:13,454 --> 00:57:15,861
- Is it?
- Well, isn't it?

721
00:57:18,459 --> 00:57:20,368
You're right.

722
00:57:21,378 --> 00:57:24,794
- I'm just overreacting, aren't I?
- Not necessarily.

723
00:57:24,924 --> 00:57:28,340
I mean, a good kiss
can scramble anybody's brain.

724
00:57:30,596 --> 00:57:34,641
Look, just don't worry about it.
Wait and see how you feel tomorrow.

725
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:38,222
- Good night.
- Good night. Thanks.

726
00:57:38,354 --> 00:57:40,393
That's my baby.

727
00:57:43,609 --> 00:57:44,809
Honey?

728
00:57:46,195 --> 00:57:49,030
Wait a minute.
Could I ask you something?

729
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:50,490
Yeah.

730
00:57:54,787 --> 00:57:56,744
Sometimes I feel a little sorry

731
00:57:56,872 --> 00:58:00,372
that I'm the one you have
to talk to about these things.

732
00:58:01,001 --> 00:58:04,702
I'm not. She couldn't have
said it any better than you.

733
00:58:05,756 --> 00:58:07,962
- I mean it.
- Good night.

734
00:59:06,192 --> 00:59:08,599
OK, make my day.

735
00:59:08,736 --> 00:59:11,108
I want all the gory details.

736
00:59:11,238 --> 00:59:15,366
The mingling breath, the pounding
heart, the steamy windows.

737
00:59:15,492 --> 00:59:17,532
I want the whole scoop.

738
00:59:17,661 --> 00:59:20,746
I hate to disappoint you,
but nothing happened.

739
00:59:21,999 --> 00:59:23,599
Nothing?

740
00:59:24,168 --> 00:59:26,955
Well, not nothing. I mean, I kissed him.

741
00:59:28,506 --> 00:59:31,460
- Anywhere interesting?
- Please!

742
00:59:33,135 --> 00:59:34,135
So...

743
00:59:35,971 --> 00:59:39,554
does he have strong lips?

744
00:59:40,267 --> 00:59:43,434
- How can you tell?
- Did you feel it in your knees?

745
00:59:44,104 --> 00:59:48,054
- I felt it everywhere.
- Strong lips.

746
00:59:54,114 --> 00:59:56,154
Talk about lips!

747
00:59:58,410 --> 01:00:02,823
I'm old enough to be his mother, but
when the Duck laid that kiss on me,

748
01:00:02,957 --> 01:00:06,657
I swear to God,
my thighs just went up in flames.

749
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:10,624
He must practise
on melons or something.

750
01:00:10,756 --> 01:00:12,796
Is this your prom dress?

751
01:00:15,177 --> 01:00:17,799
- Believe it or not.
- It's great.

752
01:00:18,264 --> 01:00:21,015
- It's silly.
- It's a great material.

753
01:00:24,436 --> 01:00:26,678
You know, I'm going.

754
01:00:26,814 --> 01:00:29,214
To the prom.

755
01:00:29,441 --> 01:00:33,024
- Stop it!
- No, I am.

756
01:00:33,153 --> 01:00:37,151
Last night he asked me,
and, I don't know, I said yes.

757
01:00:38,117 --> 01:00:40,156
It seems really weird.

758
01:00:40,911 --> 01:00:43,070
But it might be kinda fun.

759
01:00:44,665 --> 01:00:48,829
You were here for 15 minutes
and you didn't even tell me!

760
01:00:48,961 --> 01:00:51,582
I really, really wanted to go.

761
01:00:57,344 --> 01:00:59,218
You lucky girl.

762
01:01:05,644 --> 01:01:07,684
Isn't that a dreamy dress?

763
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:29,329
- Iona, I have to go.
- Will you hold me till this song's over?

764
01:01:30,711 --> 01:01:33,083
But I have to leave.

765
01:01:33,631 --> 01:01:37,675
Why can't we start old
and get younger?

766
01:01:42,556 --> 01:01:47,183
I envy you. I really envy you!

767
01:01:49,188 --> 01:01:51,477
Iona, you're gonna OD on nostalgia.

768
01:01:53,234 --> 01:01:55,273
I love <i>The Big Chi//.</i>

769
01:01:56,362 --> 01:01:59,149
- I love this dress.
- It's a great dress.

770
01:01:59,281 --> 01:02:00,281
Yeah.

771
01:02:01,617 --> 01:02:05,484
My mother bought it for me.
God, she was so happy.

772
01:02:06,455 --> 01:02:09,491
It was the first and last time
I ever looked normal.

773
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:12,163
I mean, relatively speaking.

774
01:02:12,294 --> 01:02:16,672
Would have been a fairy tale if my date
hadn't been the only one there with a...

775
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:19,041
wife and two kids.

776
01:02:21,303 --> 01:02:25,135
You wanna try it on?
I bet it'd look great on you!

777
01:02:25,266 --> 01:02:28,599
I mean, your butt is
15 years younger than mine.

778
01:02:28,727 --> 01:02:33,603
I used to have a great butt. I did, I loved
my butt! I wish I had photographs of it.

779
01:02:33,732 --> 01:02:36,686
- You wanna try this on?
- No, not right now.

780
01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:41,066
Oh, yeah, you gotta go. I know, I know.
I gotta get ready myself.

781
01:02:41,198 --> 01:02:43,950
- You going out?
- Yeah. New guy.

782
01:02:45,077 --> 01:02:47,864
Terrence. Owns a pet shop.

783
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:50,452
We'll see what happens.

784
01:02:51,542 --> 01:02:55,587
- Give Mr Perfecto a squeeze for me.
- I will.

785
01:02:57,173 --> 01:02:58,573
Listen.

786
01:02:59,717 --> 01:03:02,634
If you see your little Duck Man, be kind.

787
01:03:03,470 --> 01:03:06,258
He's nursin' some
fairly serious wounds.

788
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:08,888
- OK?
- OK.

789
01:03:10,227 --> 01:03:12,267
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

790
01:03:15,733 --> 01:03:18,354
You know, we're goin' for sushi.

791
01:03:19,695 --> 01:03:22,316
Do you think this is too much?

792
01:03:24,116 --> 01:03:25,116
Bye.

793
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:34,161
I thought that was very
uncool of you last night.

794
01:03:34,293 --> 01:03:36,332
- What?
- "What"!

795
01:03:37,296 --> 01:03:39,454
- You mean Andie?
- Yeah, I mean Andie.

796
01:03:39,882 --> 01:03:41,875
What's the big deal? I like her.

797
01:03:42,009 --> 01:03:45,378
Matter of fact, I was pissed off
that you guys were so nasty to her.

798
01:03:45,513 --> 01:03:48,597
It was way out of order
for you to foist her on the party.

799
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:52,508
Steff, you hear yourself?
You hear the same asshole shit I hear?

800
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:56,221
- Do I have to spell it out for you, Blane?
- I guess so.

801
01:03:56,649 --> 01:03:58,937
Nobody appreciates
your sense of humour.

802
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:01,903
In fact, everybody's
just about to puke from it.

803
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:06,483
If you got a hard-on for trash, don't
take care of it around us, pal, all right?

804
01:04:06,617 --> 01:04:08,610
Right, buddy.

805
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:13,323
Listen, I don't need a lot of shit
on this one, Blane. I really don't.

806
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:18,711
- Money all that matters to you?
- Where the hell does that come from?

807
01:04:18,838 --> 01:04:23,665
Look around. Would I treat my parents'
house like this if money was an issue?

808
01:04:23,801 --> 01:04:27,585
Why are you doing this? Why don't
you just nail her and get it over with?

809
01:04:27,721 --> 01:04:30,675
- Why get involved?
- Is there something wrong with that?

810
01:04:30,808 --> 01:04:33,299
I just think it's stupid. It's pointless.

811
01:04:33,435 --> 01:04:38,062
- Your parents, I think, will be thrilled!
- They have nothing to do with it.

812
01:04:38,315 --> 01:04:41,934
I've seen your mother go to work
on you, Blane. It's vicious.

813
01:04:42,069 --> 01:04:44,109
When Bill and Joyce finish with you,

814
01:04:44,238 --> 01:04:47,523
you won't know whether
to shit or go sailing.

815
01:04:47,658 --> 01:04:52,201
Listen, I'm getting really bored
with this conversation, Blane.

816
01:04:52,329 --> 01:04:55,496
If you want your little piece
of low-grade ass, fine, take it.

817
01:04:55,624 --> 01:04:57,996
But if you do,
you're not gonna have a friend.

818
01:04:58,127 --> 01:05:00,997
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

819
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:04,997
If you wanna make
the choice, go ahead.

820
01:05:05,217 --> 01:05:10,460
I personally wouldn't trash a friendship
over it, but I'm old-fashioned, so...

821
01:05:11,724 --> 01:05:14,760
Why don't you take a shower?
You look like shit.

822
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:19,972
If two weeks ago
somebody told me I'd go out with you,

823
01:05:20,107 --> 01:05:22,147
I never would have believed them.

824
01:05:22,276 --> 01:05:25,230
- Why? I'm not all that bad.
- No. But...

825
01:05:25,362 --> 01:05:27,651
What about me and you?

826
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:34,236
It's insane that somebody you've never
met or talked to can be your enemy.

827
01:05:39,126 --> 01:05:40,126
Yep.

828
01:05:44,965 --> 01:05:47,717
You shouldn't meet my parents, then.

829
01:05:47,843 --> 01:05:48,843
OK.

830
01:05:50,763 --> 01:05:53,254
Well, I mean, they're not ogres, but...

831
01:05:55,601 --> 01:05:59,681
I think they still believe
in arranged marriages.

832
01:05:59,813 --> 01:06:03,229
Corporate families
replace royal families.

833
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:06,360
I'm the crown prince
of McDonough Electric.

834
01:06:08,113 --> 01:06:10,153
- It's irrelevant.
- No.

835
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:15,620
Yeah.

836
01:06:19,458 --> 01:06:22,578
- I could tell 'em all to go to hell.
- Tell 'em to go to hell.

837
01:06:22,711 --> 01:06:25,463
- Everyone. Friends, parents.
- All of 'em.

838
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:30,090
What about you?

839
01:06:31,762 --> 01:06:36,590
If somebody doesn't believe in me,
I can't believe in them.

840
01:06:38,936 --> 01:06:41,392
You don't lie, do you?

841
01:06:41,522 --> 01:06:43,561
I don't have to lie.

842
01:06:49,363 --> 01:06:51,403
This is gonna happen.

843
01:06:52,533 --> 01:06:54,572
OK, I really want this to happen.

844
01:07:29,904 --> 01:07:30,904
Yeah.

845
01:08:23,749 --> 01:08:26,418
- Can I help you?
- I'm fine, thank you.

846
01:08:26,544 --> 01:08:29,117
- Something for the prom?
- Just looking.

847
01:08:30,130 --> 01:08:32,586
Yeah. Well, if you need anything...

848
01:08:55,406 --> 01:08:58,988
- This is trash!
- It's very becoming!

849
01:08:59,118 --> 01:09:02,701
Mother! It looks like I should be
standing on top of a wedding cake!

850
01:09:02,830 --> 01:09:04,869
Darling, don't I wish!

851
01:09:04,999 --> 01:09:09,577
I hate this material, and, by the way,
I cannot stand baby blue.

852
01:09:25,853 --> 01:09:30,479
- Do you know where he is?
- I'm sorry, he didn't tell me.

853
01:09:30,608 --> 01:09:33,858
OK. If he calls or comes home,
can you tell him to call me?

854
01:09:33,986 --> 01:09:35,397
- Who is this?
- Andie.

855
01:09:35,529 --> 01:09:36,644
- Who?
- Andie.

856
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:39,271
- Yes, could I have your number?
- He has it.

857
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:42,991
- Fine. I'll leave him a note, dear.
- OK, thanks. Bye.

858
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:49,372
Where the hell is he?

859
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:56,877
Don't fall in love. You just won't like it.

860
01:09:57,009 --> 01:09:59,049
It's very complicated.

861
01:10:24,245 --> 01:10:25,445
Andie!

862
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:32,326
Andie!

863
01:10:35,923 --> 01:10:39,339
- Andie!
- Come in!

864
01:10:41,136 --> 01:10:42,547
- Hi.
- Hi, Daddy.

865
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:45,171
I brought you something.

866
01:10:45,307 --> 01:10:49,305
- What is it?
- A little something I picked up for you.

867
01:10:53,023 --> 01:10:56,891
It's a little busy, but I know you can
make something out of it if you need to.

868
01:10:58,153 --> 01:11:03,528
- Do you like it?
- It's a beautiful colour. It's really pretty.

869
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:06,743
God, it reminds me
so much of your mom.

870
01:11:06,871 --> 01:11:11,449
She always wore pink.
And she looked so beautiful in it.

871
01:11:12,084 --> 01:11:15,418
- It's OK. Thank you.
- OK.

872
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:20,792
- Daddy?
- What?

873
01:11:20,926 --> 01:11:23,596
I want you to know
I really appreciate this.

874
01:11:23,721 --> 01:11:26,093
I think I can make something out of it.

875
01:11:28,517 --> 01:11:31,435
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure. What?

876
01:11:35,482 --> 01:11:38,318
Where'd you get the money
to pay for this?

877
01:11:38,444 --> 01:11:40,602
It wasn't that much. I had some money.

878
01:11:40,863 --> 01:11:44,861
- From your new job?
- Yeah. From my new job.

879
01:11:46,619 --> 01:11:50,070
I came home before work on
Wednesday and your car was here.

880
01:11:52,458 --> 01:11:54,700
- You didn't have to lie to me.
- Yes, I did.

881
01:11:54,835 --> 01:11:57,706
- No, you didn't!
- I did. I missed the appointment.

882
01:11:57,838 --> 01:12:00,329
- Why'd you miss it?
- It slipped my mind.

883
01:12:00,508 --> 01:12:02,334
It didn't! You didn't want the job.

884
01:12:02,468 --> 01:12:05,041
You saw the counsellor
because they forced you to.

885
01:12:05,179 --> 01:12:08,630
- What's your point, Andie?
- My point is you just didn't go.

886
01:12:08,766 --> 01:12:12,633
- I deliberately missed the appointment?
- Yes.

887
01:12:12,770 --> 01:12:15,225
Is this how you feel about me?

888
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:17,690
Yes.

889
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:21,652
- Well, I didn't know this.
- Well, now you do.

890
01:12:22,696 --> 01:12:27,239
You know everything now, huh?
You're 18 and you got a scholarship...

891
01:12:27,368 --> 01:12:31,579
- That's not fair.
- I'm ignorant, never gave you anything.

892
01:12:31,705 --> 01:12:34,623
- I never asked for anything!
- That's brilliant.

893
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:37,241
Why can't you just forget her?

894
01:12:37,378 --> 01:12:39,916
- It's late. You got school.
- No! Don't walk out.

895
01:12:40,047 --> 01:12:43,546
- Will you please listen to me?
- I've already been through this.

896
01:12:43,676 --> 01:12:46,297
Sure! You go through it every day.

897
01:12:46,428 --> 01:12:50,212
Why can't you just realise that she's
gone and she's not gonna come back?

898
01:12:50,349 --> 01:12:53,184
- She's never coming back!
- Shut up!

899
01:12:53,352 --> 01:12:57,017
Why can't you accept it?
She's just gone! She...

900
01:12:57,857 --> 01:12:59,896
Why can't you accept it?

901
01:13:00,860 --> 01:13:02,860
Because...

902
01:13:03,445 --> 01:13:05,604
I love her, that's why.

903
01:13:05,739 --> 01:13:07,946
Well, I loved her, too, you know.

904
01:13:10,536 --> 01:13:12,575
She just didn't love us back.

905
01:13:18,169 --> 01:13:22,996
OK, she tried. I don't know,
she just couldn't handle it.

906
01:13:23,132 --> 01:13:27,545
Yeah, but I knew it. I knew it all along.

907
01:13:27,678 --> 01:13:29,718
When I was five, I felt it.

908
01:13:30,723 --> 01:13:34,174
Remember when she didn't
come home that time?

909
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:37,726
I knew it then. I knew why.
I was 14 and I knew it.

910
01:13:37,855 --> 01:13:40,097
You were 50 and you didn't.

911
01:13:40,232 --> 01:13:43,518
You know, you can't go on
living every day in the past.

912
01:13:45,029 --> 01:13:50,023
She left us. We didn't leave her. There
was nothing we could do about it.

913
01:13:53,037 --> 01:13:56,951
Since when is a daughter supposed
to know more than her father?

914
01:13:59,376 --> 01:14:01,416
I've just been a blind fool.

915
01:14:03,047 --> 01:14:05,964
And you're a blind fool
that needs a shave, too.

916
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:08,715
And I need a shave.

917
01:14:10,638 --> 01:14:12,038
Well...

918
01:14:13,557 --> 01:14:16,131
You better get to bed. You got school.

919
01:14:16,268 --> 01:14:20,895
And I gotta hit the hay too, cos I got
a few things I gotta do tomorrow.

920
01:14:21,774 --> 01:14:22,774
OK.

921
01:14:28,948 --> 01:14:32,815
I would have got you some shoes,
but I didn't know your size.

922
01:15:47,234 --> 01:15:49,234
Hey, Mary.

923
01:16:09,048 --> 01:16:12,002
- How you doin'?
- Why haven't you called me?

924
01:16:12,593 --> 01:16:17,006
I got nailed for the stable thing. The
groom saw us. It's against club rules.

925
01:16:17,139 --> 01:16:20,342
I called you three times
and I left messages.

926
01:16:20,476 --> 01:16:22,765
Yeah? Well, I didn't get 'em.

927
01:16:22,895 --> 01:16:26,264
My family, they're irresponsible
about that stuff.

928
01:16:26,398 --> 01:16:28,438
I waited for you this morning.

929
01:16:29,193 --> 01:16:31,232
- Yeah? Where?
- Parking lot.

930
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:36,776
I saw you, and I thought
that you saw me.

931
01:16:38,327 --> 01:16:39,327
No.

932
01:16:41,705 --> 01:16:44,078
What about prom, Blane?

933
01:16:45,584 --> 01:16:47,707
I'm having a bad day. Can we talk later?

934
01:16:47,878 --> 01:16:50,879
- No. What about prom?
- Why don't we meet after school?

935
01:16:51,006 --> 01:16:53,924
- No! What about prom?
- Andie, come on.

936
01:16:54,051 --> 01:16:56,507
- Just say it.
- What?

937
01:16:56,637 --> 01:16:58,677
I wanna hear you say it.

938
01:16:59,390 --> 01:17:03,222
- Andie, please. All right?
- I wanna hear you say it.

939
01:17:06,355 --> 01:17:08,763
A month ago, I asked
somebody else and I forgot.

940
01:17:08,899 --> 01:17:11,770
You're a liar! You're a
filthy fucking no-good liar!

941
01:17:11,902 --> 01:17:14,274
You didn't have the guts
to tell me the truth.

942
01:17:14,405 --> 01:17:16,777
- Just say it!
- I'm not lying.

943
01:17:16,907 --> 01:17:19,659
- Tell me!
- What do you wanna hear? What?

944
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:23,030
- You're ashamed to be seen...
- No, I am not. I am not.

945
01:17:23,163 --> 01:17:27,707
You're afraid! You're terrified that your
goddamn rich friends won't approve!

946
01:17:27,835 --> 01:17:31,120
Just say it! Just tell me the truth!

947
01:17:35,718 --> 01:17:40,095
You don't understand that
it has nothing at all to do with you.

948
01:17:40,264 --> 01:17:41,464
Andie!

949
01:17:43,642 --> 01:17:44,842
Andie!

950
01:18:04,830 --> 01:18:07,950
Forget about it.
It's not worth getting upset over.

951
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:11,287
- Why don't you take off?
- Any girl that did that to me,

952
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:14,207
I would not be too jazzed
to hold on to, Blane.

953
01:18:15,674 --> 01:18:18,248
It's not worth it.
I told you it wasn't gonna work.

954
01:18:18,385 --> 01:18:21,671
The girl was, is,
and will always be, <i>nada.</i>

955
01:18:53,712 --> 01:18:55,871
You got a problem, friend?

956
01:19:30,583 --> 01:19:32,622
All right, all right.

957
01:19:43,137 --> 01:19:45,176
Thanks, huh?

958
01:20:01,488 --> 01:20:03,944
- Andie?
- Yeah.

959
01:20:04,074 --> 01:20:06,565
- You're Andie, aren't you?
- Yeah, I am.

960
01:20:07,161 --> 01:20:11,953
- How do you know me?
- Well, Iona told me. I'm Terrence.

961
01:20:12,082 --> 01:20:15,202
- Pet shop. Right?
- Yeah, among other things.

962
01:20:15,336 --> 01:20:20,247
She's in the bedroom getting ready. You
might wanna go and tell her we're late.

963
01:20:20,382 --> 01:20:21,382
OK.

964
01:20:25,137 --> 01:20:26,137
Iona?

965
01:20:28,974 --> 01:20:30,766
Nice to meet you.

966
01:20:46,367 --> 01:20:49,368
- Iona?
- Hi, honey! I'm in here.

967
01:20:51,539 --> 01:20:54,112
- Laugh and I'll deck ya.
- What happened?

968
01:20:56,794 --> 01:20:59,285
Either it's all those drugs
I took in the '60s,

969
01:20:59,421 --> 01:21:02,173
or I am really in love.

970
01:21:04,176 --> 01:21:06,216
What do you think? Honestly?

971
01:21:07,012 --> 01:21:09,682
Honestly I think you look great.

972
01:21:09,807 --> 01:21:15,050
- I look like a mother.
- No. Well, yeah, a little, but that's OK.

973
01:21:16,689 --> 01:21:18,895
You look happy.

974
01:21:19,024 --> 01:21:20,024
I am.

975
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:23,649
It's weird but... Did you meet him?

976
01:21:24,113 --> 01:21:26,319
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

977
01:21:26,448 --> 01:21:30,031
He's a yuppie, but he's so nice.

978
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:32,568
He's employed. He's heterosexual.

979
01:21:32,705 --> 01:21:35,456
I'm so far ahead of the game,
next time you see me,

980
01:21:35,583 --> 01:21:38,667
I'll probably be picking out
my china patterns.

981
01:21:41,213 --> 01:21:43,336
Are you all right? No, you're not.

982
01:21:44,717 --> 01:21:47,837
- It's what happened with your mom?
- No, that's not it.

983
01:21:48,429 --> 01:21:50,468
Boy trouble?

984
01:21:50,931 --> 01:21:53,601
- The worst?
- Way beyond.

985
01:21:54,268 --> 01:21:56,557
He packed out on me.

986
01:21:56,687 --> 01:22:00,056
He said he asked somebody else
and he forgot about it.

987
01:22:02,109 --> 01:22:04,896
I can't believe it. I can't believe it.

988
01:22:08,324 --> 01:22:10,363
I'm so humiliated.

989
01:22:11,493 --> 01:22:13,533
I could have killed him, I swear.

990
01:22:14,496 --> 01:22:19,075
- You know, I just walked right into it.
- No, no.

991
01:22:20,503 --> 01:22:23,420
Love is awful, isn't it?

992
01:22:25,549 --> 01:22:27,149
It's OK.

993
01:22:36,352 --> 01:22:41,227
You remember you said that if I wanted
your prom dress, I could have it?

994
01:22:42,608 --> 01:22:44,647
Well, I need it. I want it.

995
01:22:46,904 --> 01:22:49,656
- What for?
- I just need it.

996
01:22:51,825 --> 01:22:52,825
OK.

997
01:22:56,163 --> 01:22:58,203
It's yours.

998
01:24:39,975 --> 01:24:42,513
Oh, my God. Look at you.

999
01:24:44,647 --> 01:24:48,229
Another first. Your guy is gonna
fall to the floor when he comes in.

1000
01:24:48,359 --> 01:24:51,478
- No, he won't.
- The hell he's not!

1001
01:24:51,612 --> 01:24:54,566
No, he really won't. He's not coming.

1002
01:24:54,698 --> 01:24:57,403
- What?
- It's OK.

1003
01:24:57,535 --> 01:24:59,574
- I'm gonna go.
- Alone?

1004
01:25:00,704 --> 01:25:03,492
Yeah, I'm not sad about it. I'm not hurt.

1005
01:25:03,624 --> 01:25:06,411
I mean, I am hurt a little bit.

1006
01:25:06,544 --> 01:25:09,035
But I know if I don't do it,
I'll feel a lot worse.

1007
01:25:09,171 --> 01:25:12,457
I'm just gonna go in, walk in,
walk out and come home.

1008
01:25:13,717 --> 01:25:15,517
You sure?

1009
01:25:17,221 --> 01:25:20,506
I just wanna let them know
that they didn't break me.

1010
01:26:01,599 --> 01:26:03,176
Open up.

1011
01:26:17,615 --> 01:26:21,992
When anybody's ready to go upstairs
and get serious, just let me know.

1012
01:26:22,119 --> 01:26:24,112
We've only been here an hour.

1013
01:26:24,246 --> 01:26:27,081
We can go up and come back
down again, all right?

1014
01:26:27,208 --> 01:26:29,449
Did you look at the suite?

1015
01:26:29,585 --> 01:26:33,333
It's 300 bucks a night, Benny.
It's not gonna be a palace, OK?

1016
01:26:33,839 --> 01:26:38,797
We should stay for a while. We won't
see these people for much longer.

1017
01:26:38,928 --> 01:26:41,549
Come on, stay to the end, OK?

1018
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:44,136
I don't give a shit what you do.

1019
01:27:17,132 --> 01:27:18,132
Damn.

1020
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:06,764
- You're here! What happened?
- Well, I guess you're looking at it.

1021
01:28:06,891 --> 01:28:08,930
You look great.

1022
01:28:09,059 --> 01:28:13,721
Thanks. You look stunning.
Really. It's breathtaking.

1023
01:28:15,691 --> 01:28:20,234
Listen, I want you to know,
despite my appearance at this function,

1024
01:28:20,362 --> 01:28:22,936
I remain now, and will always be,

1025
01:28:23,073 --> 01:28:25,113
a Duck Man.

1026
01:28:30,456 --> 01:28:32,495
I admire you.

1027
01:28:33,292 --> 01:28:35,331
If you wish.

1028
01:28:38,255 --> 01:28:40,295
Let's plough.

1029
01:29:22,258 --> 01:29:24,297
Shall we dance?

1030
01:29:25,135 --> 01:29:27,175
Wouldn't be unheard of.

1031
01:29:31,892 --> 01:29:34,810
A little lingering doubt,
perhaps, Blane?

1032
01:29:34,937 --> 01:29:38,306
You know, you gotta give her credit.
After you dumped her,

1033
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:43,980
she went out and found herself
probably the most interesting date...

1034
01:29:44,113 --> 01:29:45,313
Steff.

1035
01:29:47,908 --> 01:29:51,573
You buy everything. You couldn't
buy her, that's what's killing you.

1036
01:29:51,704 --> 01:29:53,862
- I don't wanna listen...
- Steff.

1037
01:29:54,623 --> 01:29:56,663
That's it, Steff.

1038
01:29:57,626 --> 01:29:59,666
She thinks you're shit.

1039
01:30:00,921 --> 01:30:03,673
And deep down, you know she's right.

1040
01:30:18,230 --> 01:30:21,475
- Hi.
- Hi.

1041
01:30:34,705 --> 01:30:36,863
You don't need me to say I'm sorry.

1042
01:30:37,833 --> 01:30:40,668
It's done. It's over with. I'm fine.

1043
01:30:42,922 --> 01:30:45,626
Well, if that's true, then I'm glad.

1044
01:30:51,347 --> 01:30:55,427
It's not true.
But it doesn't matter, does it?

1045
01:30:57,895 --> 01:31:02,023
You told me you couldn't believe in
somebody who didn't believe in you.

1046
01:31:02,149 --> 01:31:05,067
I always believed in you.

1047
01:31:05,194 --> 01:31:07,732
I just didn't believe in me.

1048
01:31:12,785 --> 01:31:14,824
I love you.

1049
01:31:20,793 --> 01:31:22,193
Always.

1050
01:31:30,636 --> 01:31:31,836
Andie.

1051
01:31:34,473 --> 01:31:36,513
He came here alone.

1052
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:43,138
OK, you're right.
He's not like the others.

1053
01:31:48,112 --> 01:31:52,690
If you don't go to him now, I'm never
gonna take you to another prom again!

1054
01:31:53,826 --> 01:31:58,203
This is an incredibly romantic moment,
and you're ruining it for me.

1055
01:32:02,168 --> 01:32:04,207
Thanks, Duckie.

1056
01:32:06,589 --> 01:32:08,389
Go ahead.

1057
01:32:43,417 --> 01:32:44,617
Blane!
