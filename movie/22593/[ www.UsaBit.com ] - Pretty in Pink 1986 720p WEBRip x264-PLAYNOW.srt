00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:30,016
Daddy, it's 7:30!

3
00:01:34,853 --> 00:01:36,412
Daddy, it's 7:30.

4
00:01:37,988 --> 00:01:39,330
Daddy, wake up!

5
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:42,303
Morning, Daddy.
Come on, wake up.

6
00:01:43,139 --> 00:01:45,530
Wake up. Come on, wake up.

7
00:01:46,242 --> 00:01:47,518
There's your coffee, right there.

8
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:49,049
Oh, where am I?

9
00:01:50,596 --> 00:01:52,503
Here, I want you to drink this.

10
00:01:52,674 --> 00:01:55,009
Then I want you to take a shower.
Then I want you to get dressed.

11
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,089
There are your clothes, right there.

12
00:01:56,164 --> 00:01:58,266
And then I want you to go to see
the woman about the job, okay?

13
00:01:58,339 --> 00:02:00,192
- Today, you promised.
- I know.

14
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:02,747
What would I do without you
nagging me all the time?

15
00:02:02,818 --> 00:02:04,860
You really want me to answer that?

16
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,797
God, I've been getting in
kind of late lately.

17
00:02:08,865 --> 00:02:10,970
We haven't had a chance to talk
or anything.

18
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,496
Oh, don't worry about it.
There hasn't been a lot to say.

19
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:16,538
- Is everything all right with you?
- Yeah.

20
00:02:16,898 --> 00:02:20,892
- Is school good?
- No, but it never is.

21
00:02:20,961 --> 00:02:23,516
- Have you been asked to the prom?
- No.

22
00:02:23,937 --> 00:02:25,282
Not yet.

23
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,505
When was the last time I told you
how beautiful you are?

24
00:02:28,674 --> 00:02:30,365
About yesterday.

25
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,788
- Hey, hey, turn around.
- What?

26
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:36,288
You know what.
Come here, let me see this outfit.

27
00:02:36,353 --> 00:02:39,802
- And is this your latest creation?
- This is it.

28
00:02:39,905 --> 00:02:41,881
My God, what did that cost you?

29
00:02:42,176 --> 00:02:46,073
Oh, about $15 for the shoes,
secondhand, and I made the rest.

30
00:02:46,403 --> 00:02:47,742
Unbelievable.

31
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:53,632
I was thinking maybe
that you could do something with this.

32
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:56,928
- Maybe put some ruffles up here.
- Come on, get up! No, really, I mean it.

33
00:02:56,994 --> 00:02:58,586
This means a lot to me.

34
00:02:58,947 --> 00:03:01,333
Honey, I'm perfectly happy
with what I'm doing.

35
00:03:01,407 --> 00:03:03,797
You're perfectly happy
with part-time work?

36
00:03:05,026 --> 00:03:07,327
No, that's why I'm getting up.

37
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,304
Okay. I'll make you some breakfast.

38
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:20,790
I'm up!

39
00:03:44,034 --> 00:03:46,367
- Hi, Blane.
- Hi, Kate. How you doing?

40
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,091
- Fine. How are you?
- Good.

41
00:03:59,682 --> 00:04:00,661
Good morning!

42
00:04:00,737 --> 00:04:02,558
Welcome to another day
of higher education.

43
00:04:02,623 --> 00:04:03,901
Hi, Duckie. How are you?

44
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,869
Not all that bad,
considering I'm in this dump.

45
00:04:08,257 --> 00:04:10,645
You know, this is a really
volcanic ensemble you're wearing.

46
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:11,734
It's really marvelous.

47
00:04:11,807 --> 00:04:13,980
- Volcanic?
- Well, you know, hot, dangerous.

48
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:15,294
Are you gonna go to class today?

49
00:04:15,361 --> 00:04:17,697
Well, I don't know
if I'm emotionally ready.

50
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,575
- Oh, go for it. It's virtually painless.
- Excuse me.

51
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,545
- I gotta go, okay? I'll see you at lunch.
- Okay, well, listen,

52
00:04:23,614 --> 00:04:26,431
I'll call ahead to the cafeteria
and make a couple of reservations.

53
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,987
- You know, two by the window.
- Sure.

54
00:04:28,065 --> 00:04:30,615
Well, no. You don't like to sit in the sun.
Okay, something else.

55
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,988
Listen, may I admire you again today?

56
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,823
Ladies, ladies, listen,
I may be able to work out a deal

57
00:04:41,888 --> 00:04:44,571
where either one or the both of you
could be pregnant by the holidays.

58
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,948
What do you say?

59
00:04:50,528 --> 00:04:53,625
Some argue that the New Deal
saved the capitalist system.

60
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:56,248
And as evidence
that the Roosevelt administration

61
00:04:56,318 --> 00:05:00,149
was trying to avoid
excessive governmental power

62
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,999
rather than implant socialism,

63
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:06,899
in his first act as President,
Mr. Roosevelt enacted

64
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:08,567
the Emergency Banking Act,

65
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,028
and he refused
to consider nationalization.

66
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,416
Where'd you get your clothes,
five-and-dime store?

67
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:21,976
Attractive.

68
00:05:22,143 --> 00:05:24,761
Is there a problem, ladies?

69
00:05:25,502 --> 00:05:27,325
- No.
- No.

70
00:05:29,535 --> 00:05:32,951
Andie, is there something going on
between you and these ladies?

71
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,939
No, not that I'm aware of.

72
00:05:37,311 --> 00:05:40,855
I'd like to apologize on behalf
of Miss Trombley and Miss Hanson.

73
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,188
These two young ladies will be thinking
of you tonight

74
00:05:43,263 --> 00:05:46,642
as they write a summary of the chapters
that we've just covered.

75
00:05:48,511 --> 00:05:49,591
Great.

76
00:05:53,536 --> 00:05:54,964
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

77
00:05:56,862 --> 00:05:58,717
There's nothing wrong with me.
I mean, I'm fine.

78
00:05:58,784 --> 00:06:00,986
Can you just forget about the chapter?

79
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,115
Yes?

80
00:06:05,182 --> 00:06:06,742
We'll take the chapter.

81
00:06:07,292 --> 00:06:08,787
Fine, let's go on.

82
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:12,089
The Emergency Banking Act.

83
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:16,985
I'll see you guys later.

84
00:06:17,053 --> 00:06:18,299
- Hey, see ya.
- Bye.

85
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,340
Oh, Andie, you look ravishing.

86
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:23,806
So we graduate in a month.
Now, I want to know when it is

87
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,778
that you and I are gonna get together
and do something.

88
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:27,097
Try never.

89
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:29,533
Well, I'm talking about
more than sex here.

90
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:30,579
No, you're not.

91
00:06:30,653 --> 00:06:34,037
You know, I've liked you for four years,
and you treat me like shit, you know.

92
00:06:34,111 --> 00:06:36,497
I don't understand that.
What's your problem?

93
00:06:36,576 --> 00:06:38,483
Can you get off of my car?

94
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,485
You know, I've been out
with a lot of girls at this school.

95
00:06:43,548 --> 00:06:45,273
I don't see what makes you so different.

96
00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:46,998
I have some taste.

97
00:06:48,382 --> 00:06:49,811
You're a bitch.

98
00:06:51,932 --> 00:06:53,460
You know,
I think you ought to see a doctor,

99
00:06:53,534 --> 00:06:56,501
'cause that condition of yours
could get a lot worse.

100
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:29,147
Applause, applause, applause.

101
00:07:30,077 --> 00:07:31,450
This is beautiful.

102
00:07:31,642 --> 00:07:34,330
It's so modern.

103
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:37,850
I mean, is this fab, or what?

104
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:39,258
It's great.

105
00:07:40,253 --> 00:07:43,318
- I'm very, very good at this.
- I know.

106
00:07:43,804 --> 00:07:48,060
Such a waste that I run
a lowly little retail outlet.

107
00:07:48,348 --> 00:07:49,940
No, not if you're good at it.

108
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,181
I'm good in bed. Should I be a whore?

109
00:07:57,051 --> 00:07:58,068
It's great.

110
00:08:00,252 --> 00:08:02,584
Did you say that you went to your prom?

111
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:03,992
Yeah, sure.

112
00:08:04,604 --> 00:08:07,767
- Was it terrible?
- It was the worst.

113
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:09,298
But it's supposed to be,
you know what I mean?

114
00:08:09,371 --> 00:08:11,315
But you have to go, right?

115
00:08:11,388 --> 00:08:14,235
Well, you don't have to.
I mean, it's not a requirement.

116
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:15,990
I have this girlfriend
who didn't go to hers,

117
00:08:16,057 --> 00:08:18,875
and every once in a while she gets
this really terrible feeling, you know,

118
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:20,215
like something is missing.

119
00:08:20,284 --> 00:08:22,617
She checks her purse, you know,
she checks her keys,

120
00:08:22,683 --> 00:08:25,366
she counts her kids, she goes crazy,
and then she realizes

121
00:08:25,435 --> 00:08:28,731
that nothing is missing.

122
00:08:29,435 --> 00:08:32,753
She decided it was side effects
from skipping the prom.

123
00:08:33,436 --> 00:08:36,435
I don't know. I mean, part of me says
just go and get it over with.

124
00:08:36,507 --> 00:08:38,928
And this other part of me says
it's a stupid tradition

125
00:08:39,004 --> 00:08:40,148
and what's the point?

126
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:44,441
Well, you know,
you could say that life itself

127
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:47,186
is a stupid tradition.

128
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:51,605
But don't analyze it, just go.

129
00:08:55,643 --> 00:08:56,852
Put that back!

130
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:02,551
- You missed my eye by an inch!
- Half an inch.

131
00:09:03,355 --> 00:09:06,867
This ain't the public library, light fingers!

132
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:33,231
I'll get it.

133
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,092
Trax, what do you want?

134
00:09:40,826 --> 00:09:43,313
Tyrone, you blow.

135
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,359
Yeah, I'm working. Leave me alone.

136
00:09:49,241 --> 00:09:50,769
That's thrilling!

137
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,006
I cook for you, I do your laundry,

138
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:56,825
I sleep with you,
now you want a ride to work.

139
00:09:58,073 --> 00:10:00,016
Please grow up!

140
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:03,285
Take the bus.

141
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,223
Take a cab.

142
00:10:06,296 --> 00:10:08,532
- How you doing?
- Fine.

143
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:09,582
Good.

144
00:10:09,657 --> 00:10:11,927
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. Yeah.

145
00:10:11,994 --> 00:10:14,292
Can I get your opinion
on something here?

146
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:15,538
Maybe.

147
00:10:16,121 --> 00:10:17,071
Maybe.

148
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:20,120
This any good?

149
00:10:23,225 --> 00:10:25,134
Sticks and stones, Tyrone.

150
00:10:25,211 --> 00:10:27,313
- It's hot. White hot.
- Sticks and stones.

151
00:10:28,665 --> 00:10:30,126
Good, I'll take it.

152
00:10:31,383 --> 00:10:34,798
Okay. Will that be cash or charge?

153
00:10:34,872 --> 00:10:37,392
American Express Platinum Card,
maybe?

154
00:10:38,106 --> 00:10:39,565
Take a bus to the zoo!

155
00:10:39,641 --> 00:10:40,851
Cash.

156
00:10:41,113 --> 00:10:42,061
You know,

157
00:10:42,521 --> 00:10:46,199
every time you go to the john,
you lose IQ points.

158
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,433
It's Walter Mondale.

159
00:10:50,936 --> 00:10:54,767
- And just $7.50 is your change.
- Thanks.

160
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:57,076
Tyrone, no.

161
00:10:57,975 --> 00:10:59,700
- I don't need a bag.
- No?

162
00:10:59,768 --> 00:11:00,717
No.

163
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:02,804
I can't do these things for you.

164
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,530
- Thanks. Thanks.
- Enjoy it.

165
00:11:06,327 --> 00:11:09,044
Bondage has no place in my life.

166
00:11:09,113 --> 00:11:10,519
Since when?

167
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:14,100
Since I spent the night tied up
in the backseat of your car!

168
00:11:57,912 --> 00:11:59,635
- Jena?
- Yeah.

169
00:11:59,704 --> 00:12:03,020
Would you ever consider going out
with somebody that had money?

170
00:12:05,432 --> 00:12:10,102
I don't think it makes a difference.
I mean, it's material.

171
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:16,436
Simon? Simon.

172
00:12:16,726 --> 00:12:19,509
What would you do
if your father came home a rich man?

173
00:12:19,574 --> 00:12:20,784
Kiss his ass.

174
00:12:20,855 --> 00:12:23,276
- See?
- See what?

175
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:25,806
- What Simon just said.
- What...

176
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:28,783
Andie, what are you getting at?

177
00:12:28,856 --> 00:12:30,797
Are you... Are you going out
with a rich guy or something?

178
00:12:30,872 --> 00:12:32,149
- I gotta go.
- Hey, wait! Wait!

179
00:12:32,215 --> 00:12:34,288
- You didn't answer my question.
- No.

180
00:12:34,424 --> 00:12:37,138
- Good.
- Simon, it's been stimulating.

181
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:42,416
- How long I been coming here?
- I don't know, a couple years.

182
00:12:42,486 --> 00:12:44,625
Okay, so, you know, we're buddies.
We're close, right?

183
00:12:44,695 --> 00:12:46,099
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Very, pal.

184
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,914
Okay, so how many times
have you let me in?

185
00:12:48,982 --> 00:12:50,475
I never let you in, you know that.

186
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:53,364
- So you see what I'm saying?
- I don't know. What are you saying?

187
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,699
What I'm saying is
my girlfriend is in there,

188
00:12:55,766 --> 00:12:56,779
and I'm out here.

189
00:12:56,854 --> 00:13:00,268
Well, she's a girl and she's my friend,
so she's a girlfriend.

190
00:13:00,343 --> 00:13:01,585
But she's in there, and I'm out here!

191
00:13:01,653 --> 00:13:04,108
I mean, you're a sensitive,
sexually potent kind of guy.

192
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:05,807
You gotta know how that hurts.

193
00:13:05,877 --> 00:13:08,048
Now let me ask you a question,
seriously.

194
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:11,026
Why does she come here,
knowing I don't let you in?

195
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,290
- Huh? Think about it.
- I don't know.

196
00:13:16,053 --> 00:13:19,697
All right, my advice to you is dump her.

197
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:21,905
Lose her. You don't need that.

198
00:13:21,973 --> 00:13:25,234
You see what I'm saying?
You see the point I'm trying to make?

199
00:13:25,685 --> 00:13:29,036
Love's a bitch, Duck. Love's a bitch.

200
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,530
- Ain't it the truth.
- Oh, it's the truth.

201
00:13:31,638 --> 00:13:33,230
- High-five.
- All right.

202
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,249
Go for it.

203
00:13:34,996 --> 00:13:36,785
You wanna try a cigarette? Come on.

204
00:13:36,855 --> 00:13:38,282
Oh, the babe, the babe, the babe.

205
00:13:38,355 --> 00:13:40,267
Hey, honey, honey,
let me ask you a personal question.

206
00:13:40,342 --> 00:13:43,471
If you worship the Duck, why don't you
hang out somewhere he could get in?

207
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:44,686
Good night, Dice Man!

208
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:47,213
Hey, say hello to the wife and kids,
you know what I'm saying?

209
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,299
Yeah.

210
00:13:48,372 --> 00:13:50,283
You see, the Dice Man is dyslexic.
He gets everything backwards.

211
00:13:50,357 --> 00:13:52,179
- What he meant to say was, like, if I...
- It's okay, Duckie.

212
00:13:52,247 --> 00:13:53,967
Oh, okay. 'Cause you're sure?
Because if he offended you,

213
00:13:54,038 --> 00:13:55,760
I would gladly clean up this parking lot
with his butt.

214
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:57,901
- No, I'm fine. Don't worry about it.
- Okay. Okay.

215
00:13:57,973 --> 00:14:01,071
- Were you here long?
- No, no. Three, four hours.

216
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:02,667
You have a good time, at least?

217
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:05,106
- Oh, good, that's good. Now, what now?
- Bed.

218
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:09,328
- Yours or mine? Ours?
- Nice try.

219
00:14:09,396 --> 00:14:10,377
Okay.

220
00:14:10,453 --> 00:14:12,656
- Can you at least give me a ride home?
- Yeah, get in.

221
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,432
Can I, like, put my head in your lap?

222
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,349
No, wait, can I rest my head
on your shoulder and let you steer?

223
00:14:19,412 --> 00:14:21,517
- Get in, Duckie.
- Okay.

224
00:14:26,772 --> 00:14:28,714
These houses are amazing, Duck.

225
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,212
Hey, the first million I make,
I buy you one.

226
00:14:31,283 --> 00:14:32,592
I hate this song.

227
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:34,383
They're so beautiful.

228
00:14:34,452 --> 00:14:36,819
Hey, you want beauty, look in the mirror.

229
00:14:36,885 --> 00:14:38,859
This whole tape is horrible.

230
00:14:39,765 --> 00:14:41,488
I must be going through, like,
a hormone thing,

231
00:14:41,556 --> 00:14:43,345
'cause every song I listen to
is making me sick.

232
00:14:43,413 --> 00:14:45,801
I mean, why can't I find
a decent song here?

233
00:14:46,451 --> 00:14:49,647
- That one's my favorite.
- Are you deaf?

234
00:14:49,813 --> 00:14:51,021
The house.

235
00:14:52,436 --> 00:14:56,266
Oh, yeah, yeah. That's a nice little crib.

236
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,386
I wonder what it's like inside.

237
00:14:59,026 --> 00:15:01,516
Well, what difference does it make?

238
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:04,176
You know what
the really sad thing is though?

239
00:15:04,243 --> 00:15:07,407
I bet the people that live there
don't think it's half as pretty as I do.

240
00:15:07,475 --> 00:15:10,028
- You know what I mean?
- You know, Andie, I'm just...

241
00:15:10,099 --> 00:15:11,923
They just don't write love songs
like they used to.

242
00:15:11,987 --> 00:15:13,264
It's... I'm...

243
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,022
I'm angry about this, you know?

244
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,033
My evening's shot.

245
00:15:17,107 --> 00:15:18,700
Just drive me home, now.

246
00:16:39,761 --> 00:16:40,711
Hey.

247
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,911
Well, the reason I came over,

248
00:16:44,976 --> 00:16:48,173
I mean, other than I'd been planning
to come by and just say hello,

249
00:16:48,243 --> 00:16:51,057
I wanted to talk to you about Andie.

250
00:16:51,122 --> 00:16:53,805
- Yeah.
- I mean, she's an incredible individual.

251
00:16:53,873 --> 00:16:55,498
I mean, you know that.
I mean, I'm there for her!

252
00:16:55,569 --> 00:16:57,773
Whenever, however, I'm there.

253
00:16:57,841 --> 00:16:59,915
You can rest assured
that she's covered.

254
00:16:59,984 --> 00:17:02,733
I don't want you to worry,
because my only future plans are

255
00:17:02,801 --> 00:17:04,558
to make sure that she's taken care of.

256
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:06,731
That's nice of you, Phil.

257
00:17:06,962 --> 00:17:08,969
And I'd like to marry her.

258
00:17:09,424 --> 00:17:13,220
Oh, well, not, you know, not today,
but eventually, I figure.

259
00:17:13,392 --> 00:17:15,759
Well, does Andie know
how you feel about this?

260
00:17:17,842 --> 00:17:19,369
No confirmation on that just yet.

261
00:17:19,441 --> 00:17:21,349
I mean, I'm laying the groundwork
and everything, you know.

262
00:17:21,426 --> 00:17:23,084
I'm thinking in terms of housing,
you know, food,

263
00:17:23,152 --> 00:17:24,494
basic needs type of stuff.

264
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,666
But I'm picking my moment.

265
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,196
Yeah, I mean, you understand, right?

266
00:17:29,262 --> 00:17:33,575
Oh, sure. I felt the same way
about somebody myself.

267
00:17:33,647 --> 00:17:36,682
- Oh, a girl?
- A girl.

268
00:17:39,472 --> 00:17:42,788
I loved her and I married her.

269
00:17:43,217 --> 00:17:45,388
And one day she just split.

270
00:17:45,455 --> 00:17:47,822
Oh, wait. This was Andie's mom?

271
00:17:48,305 --> 00:17:49,732
- Yeah.
- Oh.

272
00:17:51,663 --> 00:17:55,754
So I haven't seen her in three years,
you know, and...

273
00:17:55,822 --> 00:17:57,482
But I still love her

274
00:17:57,553 --> 00:18:01,163
just as much as I ever did, you know.

275
00:18:02,736 --> 00:18:04,112
I mean, you can love Andie,

276
00:18:04,177 --> 00:18:06,031
but that doesn't mean
she's gonna love you back.

277
00:18:06,095 --> 00:18:08,518
I mean, it doesn't mean that she won't,

278
00:18:08,974 --> 00:18:12,108
but what I'm trying to say is
you can't make it happen, you know?

279
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:15,526
It either will or it won't.
It's all in the heart.

280
00:18:16,112 --> 00:18:18,729
Oh, yeah, sure, I... Cardiovascular.

281
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,667
Yeah, I understand. I've been to school.

282
00:18:22,062 --> 00:18:23,012
Yeah.

283
00:18:23,696 --> 00:18:26,892
Well, I got an appointment
with a vacuum cleaner. Gotta go.

284
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,798
Hey, you're on a whole
home improvement jag here, aren't you?

285
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,008
Yeah. Turning the old life around.

286
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,488
Oh, well, hey, more power to you.

287
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:36,137
If Tina Turner can do it,
Jack Walsh can do it, too.

288
00:18:36,207 --> 00:18:40,200
Well, thanks for taking your time.
I really, you know... I appreciate it.

289
00:18:40,271 --> 00:18:42,855
- My pleasure.
- I'm off like a dirty shirt.

290
00:18:45,806 --> 00:18:47,235
Tina Turner.

291
00:19:00,111 --> 00:19:01,321
Hiya.

292
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:05,097
We just got these glasses in.

293
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,884
- They're really
- Yeah, I didn't like that album I got

294
00:19:07,952 --> 00:19:09,926
- the other day.
...dumb.

295
00:19:09,999 --> 00:19:11,274
- What?
- What?

296
00:19:12,271 --> 00:19:13,830
- The record.
- Oh, the record.

297
00:19:13,901 --> 00:19:17,515
- Yeah, I thought it was a little too...
- Too hip, maybe?

298
00:19:18,862 --> 00:19:20,619
Yeah, a little too hip.

299
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,374
Well...

300
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:26,471
Think you can recommend something
else a little less political, or something?

301
00:19:28,015 --> 00:19:29,868
- Lionel Richie?
- Nah.

302
00:19:31,182 --> 00:19:35,405
No, well, Teena Marie, Madonna?

303
00:19:35,469 --> 00:19:36,418
Madonna?

304
00:19:36,496 --> 00:19:38,250
- Yeah, Madonna.
- That's awfully deep.

305
00:19:38,317 --> 00:19:41,614
Yeah, very deep,
but she's got such great style.

306
00:19:43,086 --> 00:19:45,029
Yeah, listen...

307
00:19:45,198 --> 00:19:46,507
That's the alarm.

308
00:19:46,573 --> 00:19:47,751
- Can you hold on for a second?
- Sure.

309
00:19:47,822 --> 00:19:49,415
Just... I'll be right back.

310
00:19:50,574 --> 00:19:51,654
Here, read this.

311
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:53,635
It's really good. Don't lose my...
No, no, no, you can use my...

312
00:19:53,709 --> 00:19:54,694
Hold on.

313
00:19:55,885 --> 00:19:57,674
What is this?

314
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:00,805
Hi! How's your day?

315
00:20:01,806 --> 00:20:04,621
Baby pumps out
about 300 decibels, huh?

316
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,814
- Did you do this?
- Well, I'm not sure.

317
00:20:07,885 --> 00:20:09,825
I mean,
I was just using your powder room,

318
00:20:09,903 --> 00:20:11,144
and I decided not to disturb you,

319
00:20:11,213 --> 00:20:12,805
so I was going to go out the back door.

320
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,536
But I guess
I must've touched something.

321
00:20:14,605 --> 00:20:15,750
How'd you get in here?

322
00:20:15,821 --> 00:20:17,346
- Are you mad?
- Yes, I'm mad.

323
00:20:17,421 --> 00:20:19,528
There are public bathrooms
all over the place!

324
00:20:19,597 --> 00:20:22,020
I'm not nine, Andie. I know that.

325
00:20:22,093 --> 00:20:24,581
It's just, it's the end of the month.
They're out of toilet-seat covers.

326
00:20:26,414 --> 00:20:28,999
You know what a stickler I am
about personal hygiene, too.

327
00:20:30,285 --> 00:20:32,967
That's ridiculous, Duckie. Why don't you
just stop making excuses?

328
00:20:33,037 --> 00:20:34,312
Blane, what are you doing?

329
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:36,683
Hey, buddy, what's up?
Nothing, hanging out.

330
00:20:36,749 --> 00:20:39,399
Well, what are you shopping for,
records or something?

331
00:20:39,468 --> 00:20:40,417
I guess.

332
00:20:40,493 --> 00:20:43,241
- Did you find anything?
- No, not really. Not really.

333
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:44,998
Well, are we gonna shoot some trap,
or what?

334
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:46,892
'Cause, I mean, if we're gonna shoot,
we gotta shake it, man.

335
00:20:46,957 --> 00:20:50,502
I don't have anyplace to go. I like
coming here, excuse me very much.

336
00:20:50,573 --> 00:20:51,915
It's okay.
I'm sorry for getting mad at you.

337
00:20:51,981 --> 00:20:54,797
I gotta get back out in front, okay?
I'll see you later.

338
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,216
This is a shitty alarm system.

339
00:21:06,284 --> 00:21:08,675
I had to open and close the door
five times before it rang!

340
00:21:08,748 --> 00:21:11,432
That's it, I'm leaving.
I'm not gonna stay here!

341
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,677
No, no way!

342
00:21:36,907 --> 00:21:39,658
Hi, it's 6:05, Duckie Dale.
Give me a call.

343
00:21:42,508 --> 00:21:45,988
6:15, Duckie Dale again. Call me, okay?

344
00:21:47,211 --> 00:21:51,521
Andie, where are you? This is the Duck.
Give me a call, okay?

345
00:21:53,835 --> 00:21:55,494
It's 6:28.

346
00:21:56,139 --> 00:21:59,042
Please call, please, please, please.

347
00:22:00,588 --> 00:22:03,588
This is Duckie. Are you really home
and just not picking up?

348
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:05,865
'Cause if so,
I feel like a giant asshole here.

349
00:22:05,931 --> 00:22:07,872
It's 6:31. Give me a call, okay, please?

350
00:22:11,691 --> 00:22:12,640
Andie, this is Steve.

351
00:22:12,715 --> 00:22:15,713
Duckie, I'll just talk to you
in the morning, okay? Bye.

352
00:22:51,211 --> 00:22:53,184
What are you doing up?
I didn't wake you up yet.

353
00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:54,598
Well, I'm fixing you breakfast.

354
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:56,968
One egg, over-medium,
and I fed the dog.

355
00:22:57,033 --> 00:22:58,660
Did Daddy feed you?

356
00:22:58,731 --> 00:23:01,151
- Your egg, Madame.
- Oh, I don't eat eggs, Daddy.

357
00:23:01,225 --> 00:23:02,307
Here, why don't you go in and eat it?

358
00:23:02,378 --> 00:23:04,266
I'll bring you your coffee and juice,
okay?

359
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,311
Okay.

360
00:23:06,507 --> 00:23:08,064
Since when don't you like eggs?

361
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,756
Oh, since about birth.
Don't worry about it.

362
00:23:11,593 --> 00:23:13,086
Hey,
you never told me why you were up.

363
00:23:13,162 --> 00:23:14,437
Well, it's morning.

364
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:18,277
Oh, you mean, why didn't you have
to drag my ass out of bed?

365
00:23:18,345 --> 00:23:19,393
Okay.

366
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:20,927
Well, I got a job.

367
00:23:21,674 --> 00:23:24,063
- No.
- Yeah.

368
00:23:25,002 --> 00:23:26,016
Where?

369
00:23:27,402 --> 00:23:29,443
Well, I'll tell you after I start.

370
00:23:30,379 --> 00:23:33,377
- When's that?
- Soon.

371
00:23:34,152 --> 00:23:36,868
I'm so proud of you! You got the job.

372
00:23:36,937 --> 00:23:39,270
- No big deal.
- Yes, it is a big deal.

373
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:40,897
It's a very big deal.

374
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:43,335
Listen, I gotta go, okay?
I'm gonna be late for school.

375
00:23:43,401 --> 00:23:45,290
You tell me all about it tonight.
I'm so proud of you.

376
00:23:45,353 --> 00:23:47,207
All right, it'll be real good.

377
00:24:10,792 --> 00:24:11,905
Hi, guys.

378
00:24:14,951 --> 00:24:17,319
- How you doing?
- Fine.

379
00:24:17,385 --> 00:24:19,073
- You?
- Okay.

380
00:24:19,145 --> 00:24:22,309
- And you?
- Well, I just said I was fine.

381
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,580
- Oh, yeah, sorry.
- No, it's okay.

382
00:24:26,727 --> 00:24:29,312
- So is this your first time out here?
- Yeah.

383
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,383
I don't think I'm very popular
out here, either.

384
00:24:32,457 --> 00:24:35,652
Oh, I don't know. You're just fine inside.

385
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:37,570
I don't know.

386
00:24:37,705 --> 00:24:39,841
I'm not really into all this shit,
you know?

387
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:40,860
Yeah.

388
00:24:42,216 --> 00:24:43,165
Yeah.

389
00:24:46,376 --> 00:24:49,190
Oh, I really liked your computer trick.

390
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,861
- Clever, huh?
- Terribly clever, yeah, terribly.

391
00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:00,581
- Are you late for something?
- Yeah, I am, as a matter of fact.

392
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:02,502
But, I mean,
it's no big deal. It's fine.

393
00:25:04,393 --> 00:25:07,424
Listen, do you wanna...
Do you wanna go out Friday?

394
00:25:08,263 --> 00:25:09,509
Yeah.

395
00:25:10,215 --> 00:25:12,006
- Yeah?
- Sure.

396
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:13,565
- Yeah. Okay.
- Sure.

397
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:15,907
- 7:00, okay?
- Yeah, that's fine.

398
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:19,139
Great, great. Well, where do you live?
I'll pick you up.

399
00:25:21,189 --> 00:25:23,973
- Where do you live?
- Oh, no, I'm sorry.

400
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:27,233
I'm gonna be working on Friday,
so you can just pick me up at the mall.

401
00:25:27,304 --> 00:25:28,317
- Okay.
- Okay?

402
00:25:28,391 --> 00:25:30,367
- Bye.
- See you.

403
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,830
Hey, Blane. How you doing?

404
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,819
Hey, buddy, what's up?

405
00:25:47,397 --> 00:25:49,734
- What are you up to?
- Oh, not much. Going to class.

406
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,449
- Well, I saw you outside.
- So?

407
00:25:52,933 --> 00:25:54,593
So what were you doing?

408
00:25:54,662 --> 00:25:56,388
What are you, my mother?

409
00:25:56,838 --> 00:25:58,693
Come on, I gotta go. I'll see you later.

410
00:25:58,756 --> 00:26:00,547
- Blane, what's going on?
- Nothing.

411
00:26:00,615 --> 00:26:03,332
Well, not nothing.
I mean, I saw you talking to that chick.

412
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:05,504
What's her name? Eddie or something.

413
00:26:05,639 --> 00:26:06,785
So what do you care?

414
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:09,243
Listen, my best friend is conversing
with a mutant,

415
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,267
you know, and I'm curious.

416
00:26:10,342 --> 00:26:12,764
I don't think that's any reason
to get defensive.

417
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:14,179
I'm not defensive.

418
00:26:14,499 --> 00:26:15,996
I just happen to like her, all right?

419
00:26:16,069 --> 00:26:19,781
Listen, all right, it's, you know,
it's your life. It's none of my business.

420
00:26:19,846 --> 00:26:21,788
You really don't think
she's got something?

421
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,419
No.

422
00:26:24,261 --> 00:26:26,117
I really don't, I'm sorry.

423
00:26:27,783 --> 00:26:29,504
You're gonna be late, buddy.

424
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:40,962
Okay, the Warsaw Pact is a treaty
that was signed by the Soviet Union

425
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,069
and its seven East European
satellites, okay?

426
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,799
And what it did was it...

427
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,456
It established a mutual
defense organization

428
00:26:47,526 --> 00:26:48,473
as a counterweight to NATO.

429
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:50,969
- Duckie.
- What? What? What? What?

430
00:26:51,334 --> 00:26:53,058
Well, what did I put?

431
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:57,506
You wrote, "The Warsaw Pact is
the pact that's named after Warsaw."

432
00:26:59,304 --> 00:27:01,635
So a teacher's just gonna know
that you're just bullshitting.

433
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,903
Okay, okay. What about the rest of it?

434
00:27:04,132 --> 00:27:07,548
Well, the Russian Revolution did not
take place in Germany.

435
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,911
- Well, what was Karl Marx then?
- He was a German.

436
00:27:10,981 --> 00:27:12,387
Well, there you go.

437
00:27:12,453 --> 00:27:14,910
Yes, but his being German
doesn't have anything to do

438
00:27:14,981 --> 00:27:17,280
with where
the Russian Revolution occurred.

439
00:27:17,348 --> 00:27:19,292
Okay, okay.

440
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,397
Okay, Duckie,
can I propose something to you

441
00:27:23,461 --> 00:27:25,054
without you getting upset or angry?

442
00:27:25,124 --> 00:27:27,741
- Well, that depends.
- On what?

443
00:27:27,876 --> 00:27:30,812
I don't know, I just said that. Go ahead.

444
00:27:31,236 --> 00:27:33,375
Well, I propose that you're deliberately
flunking your courses

445
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:35,333
so that you can stay in high school.

446
00:27:35,395 --> 00:27:37,786
Get out of here! Why would I do that?

447
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:39,103
I don't know, you tell me.

448
00:27:39,173 --> 00:27:41,954
Well, I'm not, so there's nothing to tell.

449
00:27:42,276 --> 00:27:44,033
Well, you know,
you're not always one to face things.

450
00:27:44,101 --> 00:27:45,116
What? Since when?

451
00:27:45,188 --> 00:27:47,393
- What am I not facing?
- The future.

452
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,907
Well, whether or not you face the future,
it happens, right?

453
00:27:51,078 --> 00:27:52,866
You run yourself down.
Why do you do that?

454
00:27:52,932 --> 00:27:55,235
I am not running myself down.
You think I'm running...

455
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,825
I don't think I'm running myself down.

456
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,004
Why? Because of the way I dress?

457
00:27:59,076 --> 00:28:00,090
'Cause I can laugh at myself?

458
00:28:00,165 --> 00:28:03,611
That's called a sense of humor.
You should get one, they're nice.

459
00:28:04,162 --> 00:28:05,757
What are we gonna do next year?

460
00:28:05,827 --> 00:28:07,652
Well, according to you,
I'll still be in high school.

461
00:28:07,717 --> 00:28:08,732
No, I'm serious.

462
00:28:08,803 --> 00:28:10,810
I mean, not a day has passed in, what,
eight years

463
00:28:10,885 --> 00:28:13,884
when I didn't see you
or talk to you at least 20 times.

464
00:28:13,989 --> 00:28:15,515
Well, that's devotion.

465
00:28:15,684 --> 00:28:17,440
I know,
and even though I sometimes get angry,

466
00:28:17,508 --> 00:28:19,134
you know that I secretly love it.

467
00:28:19,203 --> 00:28:20,830
You see, I knew that.

468
00:28:21,988 --> 00:28:23,743
You know,
I hope I'm not the only one in the world

469
00:28:23,812 --> 00:28:25,535
that knows what an incredible person
you are.

470
00:28:25,602 --> 00:28:28,603
Well, at this point in time,
I'm afraid you are, honey.

471
00:28:30,306 --> 00:28:32,990
Okay, I'm gonna get something to drink,
and then we work, okay? You promise?

472
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:35,294
- Oh, you bet.
- Okay, what do you want?

473
00:28:35,587 --> 00:28:38,686
- Oh, beer, Scotch, juice box, whatever.
- Okay.

474
00:28:43,268 --> 00:28:45,024
Oh, God.

475
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,965
I love this woman.

476
00:28:48,674 --> 00:28:51,640
I love this woman, and I have to tell her.

477
00:28:51,904 --> 00:28:54,525
And if she laughs, she laughs.

478
00:28:54,597 --> 00:28:58,424
And if she doesn't love me,
she doesn't love me.

479
00:28:58,499 --> 00:29:01,728
But if I don't find out...

480
00:29:01,986 --> 00:29:04,474
Oh, I love her too much.

481
00:29:10,692 --> 00:29:13,179
Love is real

482
00:29:14,561 --> 00:29:15,992
Thank you, thank you.

483
00:29:16,068 --> 00:29:18,238
Real is love

484
00:29:18,307 --> 00:29:20,760
You're a wonderful crowd here,
you know that.

485
00:29:20,898 --> 00:29:23,002
Love is living

486
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:28,727
You're fabulous. I do love you.
I do love you. You're gorgeous.

487
00:29:28,804 --> 00:29:29,915
I love your hair.

488
00:29:29,987 --> 00:29:32,605
Love is feeling

489
00:29:34,018 --> 00:29:36,384
Feeling love

490
00:29:37,218 --> 00:29:40,252
Love is wanting

491
00:29:43,362 --> 00:29:44,791
She's gonna laugh.

492
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:48,191
Would I blame her?

493
00:29:49,505 --> 00:29:50,913
- Here you go.
- Oh, shit.

494
00:29:50,977 --> 00:29:52,289
Listen, honey, thanks,
but I'm gonna split, you know.

495
00:29:52,355 --> 00:29:53,980
Why? What about your paper?

496
00:29:54,049 --> 00:29:55,960
That's what I'm gonna do,
you see, 'cause...

497
00:29:56,034 --> 00:29:58,304
I mean, if you help me,
thanks a lot, but it'll...

498
00:29:58,369 --> 00:30:00,159
It won't be my work. It'll be bogus.

499
00:30:00,227 --> 00:30:02,745
And you know,
I guess I'll see you in the a.m.

500
00:30:04,163 --> 00:30:05,984
Hey, drinking and driving don't mix.

501
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:08,089
That's why I ride a bike.

502
00:30:17,185 --> 00:30:20,032
- I got it.
- Over here.

503
00:30:20,768 --> 00:30:21,816
Get it!

504
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,987
So, what's the deal?
Are you going out this weekend?

505
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,967
I don't know. I'm not sure yet.

506
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:33,239
- Why? What are you gonna do?
- Stay at home.

507
00:30:33,312 --> 00:30:35,702
- Yeah, you gonna study again?
- Probably.

508
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,499
- Would you put that out?
- No.

509
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,577
Well, you study so much,
it makes me ill.

510
00:30:39,648 --> 00:30:41,950
- I just don't see the point.
- You don't?

511
00:30:42,016 --> 00:30:43,741
I don't wanna work in a record store
my whole life.

512
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:45,850
Yeah, what do you wanna be, a doctor?

513
00:30:46,336 --> 00:30:48,726
Oh, God. Here we go.

514
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:53,108
Okay, let's go, everybody.
Get in your lines, please. Thank you.

515
00:30:53,793 --> 00:30:55,616
- Fulmeister.
- Here!

516
00:30:56,193 --> 00:30:57,305
Besset!

517
00:30:58,945 --> 00:31:00,284
- Basono!
- Yeah.

518
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,174
- Look at that girl's shoes.
- Goulong!

519
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,149
- Oh, look. Watch out.
- Yorkland!

520
00:31:05,024 --> 00:31:07,130
- Deeds!
- Do we smell bad or something?

521
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:09,142
- Hey, Benny.
- Fox!

522
00:31:09,505 --> 00:31:12,026
- Penfield!
- I hope they shrivel up and fall off, okay?

523
00:31:13,856 --> 00:31:15,513
What was that, Miss Hoeman?

524
00:31:17,695 --> 00:31:20,794
I said, I hope they shrivel up and fall off.

525
00:31:22,017 --> 00:31:24,319
You hope what shrivels up and falls off?

526
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:27,037
Her breasts, Miss Dietz.

527
00:31:27,104 --> 00:31:28,760
- Shut up!
- I'm sorry.

528
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:33,279
- You are out of here, Hoeman.
- Right.

529
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:36,219
Bye-bye. Bye, girls.

530
00:31:40,511 --> 00:31:43,066
So, do you share
your partner's attitude?

531
00:31:44,671 --> 00:31:46,079
No, I don't.

532
00:31:50,592 --> 00:31:52,827
Eat shit.

533
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,565
Excuse me, Miss Dietz.

534
00:31:56,702 --> 00:31:58,873
You've only got a couple of months left.

535
00:31:58,944 --> 00:32:01,562
You're doing extremely well
in your courses,

536
00:32:01,823 --> 00:32:05,369
and I think your chances of getting
a scholarship are excellent.

537
00:32:05,438 --> 00:32:07,096
I know this, Mr. Donnelly.

538
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:09,497
- Why are you in here now?
- I don't know.

539
00:32:09,569 --> 00:32:11,640
I guess I just got a little fed up.

540
00:32:11,712 --> 00:32:14,972
- With what?
- The way that we get treated.

541
00:32:16,577 --> 00:32:17,753
Look,

542
00:32:18,941 --> 00:32:21,146
you're getting
a top-notch education here,

543
00:32:21,214 --> 00:32:24,279
and I just don't wanna see
you throw it away.

544
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:27,318
I'm getting a better education
than I deserve. I'm lucky.

545
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,179
I'm fortunate that the good people
of this community

546
00:32:29,246 --> 00:32:30,588
allow me to attend this school.

547
00:32:30,655 --> 00:32:32,628
Again, you are misunderstanding me.

548
00:32:32,704 --> 00:32:34,459
No, I understand everything,
Mr. Donnelly.

549
00:32:34,526 --> 00:32:37,843
I don't need to have it explained to me.
I live it.

550
00:32:37,983 --> 00:32:41,659
It's just sometimes I get a little upset,
and I lose my temper.

551
00:32:41,791 --> 00:32:43,929
I just don't like to see my friends
getting dumped on

552
00:32:43,997 --> 00:32:46,202
or punished for defending themselves.

553
00:32:48,254 --> 00:32:52,181
Well, we'll just forget about
this whole thing, okay?

554
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:54,812
Okay.

555
00:32:57,024 --> 00:33:00,404
- What about Jena?
- She's off, too.

556
00:33:01,407 --> 00:33:02,650
Thank you.

557
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:04,630
Andie,

558
00:33:05,821 --> 00:33:08,755
if you put out signals
that you don't want to belong,

559
00:33:09,054 --> 00:33:11,419
people are gonna make sure
that you don't.

560
00:33:12,063 --> 00:33:13,719
That's a beautiful theory.

561
00:33:15,453 --> 00:33:18,040
Andie, Andie, Andie, listen,
I heard what happened,

562
00:33:18,108 --> 00:33:19,636
and I came as fast as I could.

563
00:33:19,712 --> 00:33:21,337
I cut out of Home Ec and everything.

564
00:33:21,405 --> 00:33:22,966
- Was it really bad?
- No, it was nothing, Duckie.

565
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,498
- Are you upset?
- No, I'm not.

566
00:33:24,572 --> 00:33:25,523
No, yes, yes, you are.

567
00:33:25,597 --> 00:33:27,541
I can tell.
Your eyes get all squinty and everything.

568
00:33:27,615 --> 00:33:29,434
Listen, I know just what to do
to make you feel better.

569
00:33:29,502 --> 00:33:31,673
- I feel fine.
- I wanna take you away this weekend.

570
00:33:31,742 --> 00:33:32,953
Do you fish?

571
00:33:34,366 --> 00:33:36,786
- Okay, then we can go right now.
- I have a class.

572
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,552
Tonight at 7:00,
and I won't take no for an answer.

573
00:33:38,621 --> 00:33:40,114
Try, please.

574
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:43,639
This woman is suffering inside.
That's all there is to it.

575
00:33:45,917 --> 00:33:48,471
Yo, man, next time, I'll kick your ass!
That'll be that!

576
00:33:48,541 --> 00:33:50,712
I'm just kidding, that's... It's a joke. It's...

577
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,268
How about that stock market?

578
00:33:53,342 --> 00:33:55,674
You know, my broker is E.F. Hutton,
and E.F. Hutton says...

579
00:33:56,574 --> 00:33:58,460
You see, it never works. It never works.

580
00:33:58,524 --> 00:34:00,282
I've never seen that work
in my whole life.

581
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,036
Oh, shit!

582
00:34:07,164 --> 00:34:09,335
So this is what it looks like.

583
00:34:10,397 --> 00:34:11,574
This is great.

584
00:34:11,645 --> 00:34:13,271
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

585
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,164
You got doors on the stalls.

586
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,202
They're not stopped... Wait a minute!

587
00:34:17,277 --> 00:34:18,870
We don't have none of this stuff
in the boys'...

588
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,665
Wait a minute,
we don't got none of this.

589
00:34:20,733 --> 00:34:22,421
We don't got doors
on the stalls in the boys' room.

590
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:23,508
We don't have... What is this?

591
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,306
We don't have a candy machine
in the boys' room.

592
00:34:25,374 --> 00:34:27,063
- We don't got none of that. None of that.
- Enough screaming.

593
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:29,369
- You gotta get out of here.
- I'm sorry. No, I want the principal here.

594
00:34:29,435 --> 00:34:32,216
I want him here this instant.
I want... Now. This instant.

595
00:34:32,284 --> 00:34:33,625
I'll wait. Thank you.

596
00:34:44,988 --> 00:34:47,922
Oh, shit! Why can't I do this?

597
00:34:49,883 --> 00:34:51,258
What have you done?

598
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:53,657
This... You have to subtotal first.

599
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:56,177
I tell you this every time.
You never listen.

600
00:34:56,764 --> 00:35:01,237
One more tune, then it's off
to enjoy a terrible relationship.

601
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,627
The furrier next door loves this.

602
00:35:04,701 --> 00:35:06,129
Soft words

603
00:35:06,203 --> 00:35:09,553
They are spoke so gentle, yeah

604
00:35:12,892 --> 00:35:15,281
It makes it easier

605
00:35:16,188 --> 00:35:19,384
Easier to bear

606
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:25,015
You won't regret it, no, no

607
00:35:26,204 --> 00:35:28,145
Young girls, they don't forget it

608
00:35:28,797 --> 00:35:32,625
Love is their whole

609
00:35:32,698 --> 00:35:34,740
happiness

610
00:35:34,811 --> 00:35:36,153
Yeah

611
00:35:39,035 --> 00:35:42,418
But it's all so easy

612
00:35:43,163 --> 00:35:45,585
All you've gotta do is try

613
00:35:45,659 --> 00:35:49,139
Try a little tenderness

614
00:35:49,212 --> 00:35:50,160
Yeah

615
00:35:50,265 --> 00:35:53,300
All you gotta do is, man

616
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:55,312
Hold her where you want her

617
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:58,616
You got to squeeze her,
don't tease her

618
00:35:58,682 --> 00:36:00,146
Never leave her

619
00:36:00,761 --> 00:36:02,038
Get to her

620
00:36:02,106 --> 00:36:05,816
Got to, got to
try a little tenderness

621
00:36:05,883 --> 00:36:07,956
Yeah, yeah, yeah
you've got to

622
00:36:08,026 --> 00:36:09,848
know how to love her, man

623
00:36:09,914 --> 00:36:12,500
Take this advice, man

624
00:36:12,569 --> 00:36:15,571
You got to squeeze her,
don't tease her

625
00:36:15,642 --> 00:36:16,721
Never leave

626
00:36:16,794 --> 00:36:18,583
You got to hold her

627
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,691
And, brother, something else

628
00:36:20,763 --> 00:36:23,958
Try a little tenderness
Yeah, yeah, yeah

629
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:26,426
You got to, brother

630
00:36:26,555 --> 00:36:28,441
Don't lose her, no, no

631
00:36:28,507 --> 00:36:32,467
You got to love her,
tease her, don't leave her

632
00:36:32,538 --> 00:36:34,807
Got to try, now, now, now

633
00:36:34,873 --> 00:36:37,591
Try, try a little tenderness

634
00:36:37,659 --> 00:36:39,862
Yeah, watch the groove

635
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:42,897
You got to know what to do, man

636
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:44,464
Take this advice

637
00:36:44,538 --> 00:36:49,010
You gotta love and squeeze,
don't tease my baby

638
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,488
Love her, Lord

639
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:55,219
Evening, young ladies.

640
00:36:55,386 --> 00:36:57,427
This is a very good tune.
My mother used to sing this.

641
00:36:57,499 --> 00:36:58,871
This is Otis. I love Otis.

642
00:36:58,938 --> 00:37:00,215
We're closed.

643
00:37:00,443 --> 00:37:01,871
You know what an older woman
does for me?

644
00:37:01,945 --> 00:37:03,953
- Changes your diapers?
- Touche.

645
00:37:04,026 --> 00:37:05,815
No, seriously though,
you're a very smoky alternative,

646
00:37:05,882 --> 00:37:08,248
but this is the Duck Man's love in life.

647
00:37:08,315 --> 00:37:10,932
- Shall we?
- Ever had one of these?

648
00:37:11,576 --> 00:37:13,169
I don't think so.

649
00:37:14,777 --> 00:37:17,363
Come on, let's plow.

650
00:37:22,905 --> 00:37:24,247
Do I offend?

651
00:37:27,898 --> 00:37:29,458
Andie, hon,

652
00:37:30,232 --> 00:37:33,015
listen, it's after 7:00.

653
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,707
Don't waste good lip gloss.

654
00:37:34,776 --> 00:37:35,920
I know, lona.

655
00:37:36,215 --> 00:37:38,040
I mean, I don't mean to be a bitch
or anything,

656
00:37:38,104 --> 00:37:41,104
but I don't think Mr. Wonderful's gonna
happen tonight.

657
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,485
I don't know what I'm doing.

658
00:37:46,838 --> 00:37:48,532
Wishful make-uping.

659
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:49,998
Come on.

660
00:37:51,128 --> 00:37:53,495
Wait, wait, you babes are, like, talking

661
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,527
a sign language that the old Ducker
here just does not understand.

662
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,470
Now, would you mind filling me in here?
I'm a little confused.

663
00:37:59,671 --> 00:38:01,908
She got stood up, twerp.

664
00:38:02,454 --> 00:38:04,942
Stood up? Wait, how so?
Wait, I'm here!

665
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:08,465
I mean, is this like one of those
feminine mystique deals or something?

666
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,615
He showed.

667
00:38:18,103 --> 00:38:19,598
Andie?

668
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:28,977
I'll get that.

669
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:34,804
Duckie, I'm really sorry.

670
00:38:34,872 --> 00:38:37,938
What is this...
You're gonna go out with this guy?

671
00:38:38,007 --> 00:38:40,049
I mean, is this, you know,
like, a date or something?

672
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,543
Yeah. I mean, you'll like him.

673
00:38:42,617 --> 00:38:44,984
He's not like the other guys, seriously.

674
00:38:45,272 --> 00:38:47,661
No. No way. Andie!

675
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,414
You really piss me off,
you know, 'cause...

676
00:38:50,489 --> 00:38:52,909
'Cause you know they shit all over
everybody, including you.

677
00:38:52,984 --> 00:38:54,891
I just...
I can't believe you'd be this stupid.

678
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:57,139
Who's shitting on me?
I'm not gonna let anybody shit on me.

679
00:38:57,206 --> 00:38:59,824
He's just... He's gonna use
your ass and throw you away.

680
00:38:59,896 --> 00:39:01,422
God, I would've died for you!

681
00:39:01,495 --> 00:39:04,145
So what am I supposed to do?
He asked me out, and I like him!

682
00:39:04,215 --> 00:39:06,156
If I hate him because he's got...
Just listen to me.

683
00:39:06,232 --> 00:39:08,433
If I hate him because he's got money,
that's the exact same thing

684
00:39:08,505 --> 00:39:09,877
as them hating us because we don't.

685
00:39:09,943 --> 00:39:11,122
Do you understand?

686
00:39:11,191 --> 00:39:13,909
You can't do this and respect yourself.

687
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,501
You can't.

688
00:39:15,574 --> 00:39:17,101
Well, I'll make that decision, all right?

689
00:39:17,174 --> 00:39:18,999
Sure, you can do what you want.

690
00:39:19,062 --> 00:39:21,997
You know, you're talking like that
just because I'm going out with Blane.

691
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:24,307
Blane? His name is Blane?

692
00:39:24,759 --> 00:39:27,059
That's a major appliance,
that's not a name!

693
00:39:27,127 --> 00:39:30,955
Just because I'm going out with Blane,
doesn't mean I can't be friends with you.

694
00:39:31,031 --> 00:39:32,884
I mean, it doesn't change
the way I feel about you.

695
00:39:32,951 --> 00:39:35,601
Well, that's very nice. I'm glad. Here's...

696
00:39:35,927 --> 00:39:36,939
Here's the point, Andie,

697
00:39:37,014 --> 00:39:39,470
I'm not particularly concerned
with whether or not you like me.

698
00:39:40,248 --> 00:39:43,662
'Cause I live to like you,
and I can't like you anymore.

699
00:39:45,495 --> 00:39:47,862
So when you get your heart splattered
all over hell,

700
00:39:47,926 --> 00:39:49,452
and you're feeling really low and dirty,

701
00:39:49,526 --> 00:39:51,828
don't look to me to help
pump you back up,

702
00:39:51,892 --> 00:39:53,204
'cause...

703
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:56,238
'Cause maybe for the first time
in your life, I won't be there!

704
00:39:56,919 --> 00:39:58,958
I can't believe
you're actually saying this.

705
00:39:59,543 --> 00:40:01,714
Well, I guess that's just tough shit!

706
00:40:09,622 --> 00:40:11,479
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

707
00:40:23,063 --> 00:40:24,371
That guy in the store.

708
00:40:24,436 --> 00:40:27,701
Oh, he was a friend of mine.
I've known him since I was a kid.

709
00:40:27,863 --> 00:40:29,234
He's a really nice guy.

710
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:31,123
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I like him a lot.

711
00:40:32,118 --> 00:40:34,125
So do you wanna go home and change?

712
00:40:35,925 --> 00:40:38,291
I already did.

713
00:40:38,389 --> 00:40:39,914
- Sorry.
- No, that's okay.

714
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,643
Oh, boy.

715
00:40:43,445 --> 00:40:46,378
So, where are we going?

716
00:40:46,997 --> 00:40:48,405
You up for a party?

717
00:40:49,302 --> 00:40:50,894
Yeah? No? Maybe?

718
00:40:51,445 --> 00:40:52,907
No, I don't think so.

719
00:40:55,157 --> 00:40:57,228
- Why?
- Why?

720
00:40:57,302 --> 00:40:59,952
- Come on, they're my friends. It's okay.
- That's it, they're your friends.

721
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,290
I wouldn't take you
if I didn't think they'd accept you.

722
00:41:02,357 --> 00:41:04,300
Can't we just go somewhere else?

723
00:41:04,373 --> 00:41:07,022
Hey, Andie, I like you.
I think you like me.

724
00:41:07,445 --> 00:41:09,332
I mean, we both know there's a lot
of bullshit that goes on,

725
00:41:09,397 --> 00:41:10,771
but if you're above it, I'm above it.

726
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:14,482
You wanna make anything out of this
whatever, we gotta deal with it, right?

727
00:41:14,548 --> 00:41:15,661
Yeah.

728
00:41:15,798 --> 00:41:17,586
Come on, I got as much to lose as you.

729
00:41:17,652 --> 00:41:18,896
We can go out with your friends
if you want.

730
00:41:18,964 --> 00:41:20,491
Go crawl under a rock.

731
00:41:21,491 --> 00:41:24,526
Anything you want. The choice is yours.

732
00:41:24,596 --> 00:41:26,539
We can go hang-gliding.
You like hang-gliding?

733
00:41:26,611 --> 00:41:29,743
- I've never been hang-gliding.
- Well, first for everything.

734
00:41:30,965 --> 00:41:32,043
If it's a bad time, we leave.

735
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:10,960
- Hi, Blane.
- Hey, Eddie.

736
00:42:11,027 --> 00:42:11,976
We'll see you later.

737
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:18,153
Come on.

738
00:42:18,964 --> 00:42:20,458
Hey, what's up, bro?

739
00:42:24,051 --> 00:42:26,767
Hey! Aren't you the girl in my art class?

740
00:42:27,666 --> 00:42:29,259
Nice pearls.

741
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:32,103
- This isn't a dinner party, honey.
- Watch it.

742
00:42:32,179 --> 00:42:34,992
- Hey, Blane, how you doing?
- Hey, Kev, what's up?

743
00:42:41,844 --> 00:42:43,272
Great party, man.

744
00:42:45,842 --> 00:42:47,273
- All right, man.
- Later.

745
00:43:04,595 --> 00:43:07,464
I can't believe I actually associate
with these people, huh?

746
00:43:07,538 --> 00:43:09,774
I can't believe that I'm actually here.

747
00:43:09,844 --> 00:43:13,160
- Pretty bad, yeah?
- Yeah, it's pretty bad.

748
00:43:14,321 --> 00:43:15,434
I'm sorry.

749
00:43:15,956 --> 00:43:17,612
Hey, let's go upstairs, huh?

750
00:43:20,273 --> 00:43:21,452
Come on.

751
00:43:21,872 --> 00:43:24,077
Look, I didn't come here
to get you off, okay?

752
00:43:24,144 --> 00:43:26,121
- That was not my idea.
- Andie.

753
00:43:26,193 --> 00:43:29,194
Come on, that is not what I meant.
I haven't even tried to kiss you, have I?

754
00:43:30,449 --> 00:43:32,489
Look, it's quieter up there, okay.

755
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:36,589
Come on. These hands will remain
in these pockets, I swear to God.

756
00:43:37,107 --> 00:43:38,053
Come on.

757
00:43:41,554 --> 00:43:42,500
Come on.

758
00:43:46,192 --> 00:43:49,454
Look at me here.
Come on, I'm utterly defenseless.

759
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,886
And utterly foolish. Come on.

760
00:43:55,346 --> 00:43:58,923
- So what do you think of these carpets?
- Oh, fab.

761
00:44:05,234 --> 00:44:06,726
It's gonna be great.

762
00:44:07,377 --> 00:44:08,521
Oh, hey, Blane.

763
00:44:08,594 --> 00:44:10,220
- Steff.
- How you doing?

764
00:44:10,289 --> 00:44:11,269
- All right.
- Come on in.

765
00:44:11,344 --> 00:44:12,554
No, I'll get another room.

766
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:15,690
No, no, no, come on in.
I'm just watching some 'toons here.

767
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:18,984
Who have you got with you here, Blane?

768
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:21,740
Andie, this is Steff. Steff, Andie.

769
00:44:23,538 --> 00:44:26,025
Oh, well,
it's very nice to meet you, Andie.

770
00:44:26,928 --> 00:44:29,482
Listen, you wanna come in
and sit down?

771
00:44:29,552 --> 00:44:31,463
- Or you want the bed, is that it?
- No.

772
00:44:31,538 --> 00:44:32,552
No. We're fine.

773
00:44:32,624 --> 00:44:34,032
Well, at least come in and have a drink.

774
00:44:34,096 --> 00:44:35,525
Let's go. Can I get you something?

775
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,982
I mean, this is my last serious party
of my high school career.

776
00:44:39,695 --> 00:44:42,958
I hope you guys are gonna
tough it out until Sunday,

777
00:44:43,023 --> 00:44:44,519
at least when my folks get home.

778
00:44:44,592 --> 00:44:48,204
I think this one may just finally kill
the old son of a bitch, Blane.

779
00:44:48,433 --> 00:44:52,361
Another giant step away
from virginity I went.

780
00:44:52,432 --> 00:44:54,471
You are a slut, aren't you, Benny?

781
00:45:04,433 --> 00:45:06,471
Oh, my God.

782
00:45:08,049 --> 00:45:10,469
- Am I having a nightmare?
- We got guests.

783
00:45:11,345 --> 00:45:14,606
I know you. You're in my calculus class.

784
00:45:15,152 --> 00:45:17,517
- Gym.
- Your name's Jim?

785
00:45:17,583 --> 00:45:19,722
Oh, you are worthless, aren't you?

786
00:45:20,304 --> 00:45:22,605
You and your friends gave me
a lot of shit the other day.

787
00:45:22,673 --> 00:45:24,876
- Everybody gives you shit.
- Take it easy, Benny, huh?

788
00:45:24,944 --> 00:45:28,685
Hey, this is Steff's party, Blane.
Don't tell me what to do.

789
00:45:29,008 --> 00:45:30,020
Steff.

790
00:45:30,096 --> 00:45:33,095
I mean, you shouldn't be allowed
to invite just anybody.

791
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:37,802
- Steff, she's gonna ruin my night.
- Shut up, Benny!

792
00:45:38,638 --> 00:45:41,673
- You're a faggot, Blane.
- All right. Okay. Listen, Benny.

793
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:45,546
- Listen, why don't we just...
- Where are you going?

794
00:45:45,616 --> 00:45:47,276
Let's just leave them
with the room, okay?

795
00:45:47,343 --> 00:45:48,326
Why?

796
00:45:48,399 --> 00:45:50,187
And we will get you something to eat,
all right?

797
00:45:50,257 --> 00:45:53,156
- Oh, you've got what I want.
- Maybe some ribs or something.

798
00:45:53,805 --> 00:45:56,042
Listen, you guys enjoy yourselves,

799
00:45:56,111 --> 00:45:58,479
and we'll see you later, maybe.

800
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:00,199
I doubt it.

801
00:46:00,332 --> 00:46:02,090
- You all right?
- Fine.

802
00:46:02,158 --> 00:46:03,687
- You're an asshole.
- All right.

803
00:46:04,399 --> 00:46:05,676
And I don't wanna know what you are.

804
00:46:05,743 --> 00:46:07,402
I'm gonna take her
to throw up somewhere.

805
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:09,926
- Listen, enjoy yourself, Blane.
- Come here.

806
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:14,024
They're kind of jerks
when they drink, huh?

807
00:46:14,864 --> 00:46:17,829
- Bad idea.
- Can you just get me out of here now?

808
00:46:19,023 --> 00:46:20,069
Yeah.

809
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:23,752
Look, I don't want to take you home.
I mean, I'd like to be with you.

810
00:46:23,821 --> 00:46:26,407
If not here, somewhere else.
Anywhere you want.

811
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:30,760
I'm sorry. What can I say?
I made a mistake.

812
00:46:30,831 --> 00:46:33,132
I over-estimated my friends. I'm sorry.

813
00:46:36,045 --> 00:46:38,054
What, do you wanna hit me?

814
00:46:38,638 --> 00:46:39,948
Yes, I do.

815
00:46:40,592 --> 00:46:41,931
Be my guest.

816
00:47:10,062 --> 00:47:12,101
You wanna know my thing?

817
00:47:12,973 --> 00:47:15,144
If I really have it solid for a girl,

818
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:18,888
I'll ride by her house on my bike.

819
00:47:19,885 --> 00:47:22,275
I'll do it like 100 times in a day.

820
00:47:23,021 --> 00:47:24,964
And it's really... It's intense.

821
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:26,987
You ever park?

822
00:47:28,237 --> 00:47:30,407
I'm kind of a drive-by kind of guy.

823
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:43,273
- Do you want a drink?
- Yeah.

824
00:47:43,339 --> 00:47:44,322
- Yeah?
- Coke.

825
00:47:44,395 --> 00:47:46,120
Coke. Coke? Okay.

826
00:47:46,668 --> 00:47:50,280
Give me your address.
I'll put you on my route.

827
00:47:54,316 --> 00:47:56,738
Okay, you're gonna have
to help me out here.

828
00:47:57,261 --> 00:48:00,968
You know, someday that girl's gonna
realize just what she missed.

829
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,957
Come on, don't stop,
give me more! Yeah!

830
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:09,609
- Hi.
- Hi.

831
00:48:10,604 --> 00:48:12,360
Prince Charming wimp out?

832
00:48:12,428 --> 00:48:14,217
No, no, he's at the bar.

833
00:48:15,627 --> 00:48:16,806
Duckie?

834
00:48:18,892 --> 00:48:20,386
He's sulking.

835
00:48:20,588 --> 00:48:23,818
He's not gonna ride his bike
past your house anymore.

836
00:48:24,973 --> 00:48:27,461
Duckie, you're being a real jerk.

837
00:48:30,955 --> 00:48:32,679
How'd he get in here anyway?

838
00:48:34,093 --> 00:48:36,131
I said he was my kid.

839
00:48:36,716 --> 00:48:38,177
How come you're here?

840
00:48:38,284 --> 00:48:40,969
I've been trying
to figure that out all night.

841
00:48:42,474 --> 00:48:44,384
Can I get a cigarette from you, buddy?

842
00:48:46,412 --> 00:48:47,394
Sorry.

843
00:48:47,467 --> 00:48:50,149
- Mom make this for you?
- Yeah. Gross, huh?

844
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:52,290
Excuse me.

845
00:49:03,242 --> 00:49:04,421
- Hi.
- Hi.

846
00:49:04,586 --> 00:49:06,528
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

847
00:49:06,602 --> 00:49:09,124
- You met lona, didn't you?
- Not formally. Hi. Blane.

848
00:49:09,193 --> 00:49:11,945
And that's Duckie Dale over there
behind the glasses.

849
00:49:12,013 --> 00:49:14,501
- Hi, Duckie.
- Philip F. Dale to you, scum wad.

850
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:18,727
So, where you guys been?

851
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:21,830
Oh, a friend of mine was having a party.

852
00:49:21,897 --> 00:49:24,003
Oh, how adorable.

853
00:49:24,968 --> 00:49:26,345
Yeah, it was a little intense.

854
00:49:26,411 --> 00:49:29,258
Oh, wait, wait.
You had an intense party?

855
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:32,513
No, it was a friend of mine's, I said.

856
00:49:32,586 --> 00:49:34,691
Duckie, shut up.

857
00:49:36,716 --> 00:49:37,696
What's the problem?

858
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:40,040
This is a classic,
classic piece of work here.

859
00:49:40,105 --> 00:49:41,601
- Duckie, please.
- Phil.

860
00:49:41,771 --> 00:49:43,627
Hey, Phil, I think you're making
Andie uncomfortable.

861
00:49:43,691 --> 00:49:46,027
Why don't you just knock it off?
What's the problem?

862
00:49:46,091 --> 00:49:47,683
I devoted my life to the girl,
and this guy,

863
00:49:47,754 --> 00:49:49,380
he comes in one day
and thinks he knows her.

864
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:51,655
That's funny. You should give
David Letterman a ring sometime.

865
00:49:51,721 --> 00:49:53,065
I'm sure he'd book you in a minute.

866
00:49:53,129 --> 00:49:55,269
Phil, would you like us to leave?

867
00:49:55,338 --> 00:49:56,997
Yes, very perceptive.

868
00:49:57,835 --> 00:49:58,783
Come on.

869
00:50:00,522 --> 00:50:01,984
And look at the manners on this guy.

870
00:50:02,059 --> 00:50:03,487
This was a treat.
Really, thanks a million.

871
00:50:03,563 --> 00:50:05,253
You're a great couple of kids, really.

872
00:50:05,321 --> 00:50:07,624
You know, I can't believe
I actually felt bad for you tonight,

873
00:50:07,691 --> 00:50:09,216
retarded little dwarf!

874
00:50:10,156 --> 00:50:11,102
See you.

875
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:12,936
Nice meeting you.

876
00:50:13,801 --> 00:50:15,145
See you later.

877
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:16,637
- Sorry.
- No problem.

878
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:18,208
- No problem.
- You're an asshole.

879
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:21,348
Hey, blow me, butt wad. Coming
from you I take that as a compliment.

880
00:50:21,417 --> 00:50:22,793
Andie! Yo!

881
00:50:27,624 --> 00:50:29,219
You've been replaced.

882
00:50:34,025 --> 00:50:36,066
Gee, I'm sorry.

883
00:50:53,449 --> 00:50:55,074
Well, what now?

884
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,118
I gotta get up early.
Why don't we just forget it?

885
00:50:59,143 --> 00:51:00,356
What, home?

886
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:05,790
- Hey, you wanna go to my house?
- No, thanks.

887
00:51:08,104 --> 00:51:09,533
You wanna eat?

888
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:12,510
- No.
- What do you wanna do?

889
00:51:12,745 --> 00:51:13,956
Anything.

890
00:51:15,913 --> 00:51:17,700
Why don't you just drop me off at Trax?

891
00:51:17,767 --> 00:51:19,111
- You know, I can...
- Trax?

892
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:20,222
It's real close to where I live.

893
00:51:20,296 --> 00:51:21,670
Well, it's late. I'll just drop you home.

894
00:51:21,737 --> 00:51:22,979
You wanna go home, I'll drop you home.

895
00:51:23,051 --> 00:51:24,509
No, but I have something
I have to do there.

896
00:51:24,585 --> 00:51:25,829
Now? Come on, it's late.

897
00:51:25,898 --> 00:51:27,555
You wanna go home, I'll drop you home.
It's fine.

898
00:51:27,624 --> 00:51:29,479
- I don't want you to take me home.
- Okay, let's go out.

899
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:31,487
- No, I don't want...
- We'll go out anywhere you want,

900
00:51:31,561 --> 00:51:33,119
- anything you wanna do.
- I don't wanna go out.

901
00:51:33,192 --> 00:51:34,850
You don't wanna go out.
You don't wanna go home.

902
00:51:34,919 --> 00:51:37,505
- What do you want to do, Andie?
- I don't want you to take me home.

903
00:51:37,575 --> 00:51:39,332
Wait, I'm missing something.
I'm not a jerk here.

904
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,827
I don't understand what you're saying.
Wait a minute!

905
00:51:40,903 --> 00:51:42,791
- Just go.
- Don't walk away. I'm talking to you.

906
00:51:42,857 --> 00:51:43,717
- Don't. Just... Please!
- Why?

907
00:51:43,783 --> 00:51:44,995
- Don't you understand me?
- No, I don't

908
00:51:45,384 --> 00:51:46,792
- at all, obviously.
- Will you listen to me?

909
00:51:46,856 --> 00:51:50,370
- I don't want you to take me home.
- Okay. Why? What is the problem?

910
00:51:50,919 --> 00:51:53,636
Because I don't want you to see
where I live, okay?

911
00:51:53,705 --> 00:51:56,322
- What?
- I'm sorry, forget it.

912
00:51:56,391 --> 00:51:57,439
It's okay.

913
00:52:00,072 --> 00:52:01,826
Jesus Christ.

914
00:52:31,785 --> 00:52:33,853
I'm really sorry for bumming out
the night for you.

915
00:52:33,928 --> 00:52:35,966
You didn't bum out anything.
I had a great time.

916
00:52:36,808 --> 00:52:39,774
- You liar.
- I was with you. I had a great time.

917
00:52:40,487 --> 00:52:43,716
If I was in a Turkish prison,
I'd have a great time with you.

918
00:52:44,648 --> 00:52:47,169
I don't know.
It's just too weird for me, you know.

919
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,794
- Maybe this shouldn't happen.
- What, you and me?

920
00:52:51,207 --> 00:52:53,825
Well, you know,
maybe it doesn't happen all the time,

921
00:52:53,894 --> 00:52:56,382
but it doesn't mean it isn't right. Right?

922
00:52:56,805 --> 00:52:58,716
Doesn't mean you can't try.

923
00:53:03,238 --> 00:53:05,507
Feel any better
if I asked you to the prom?

924
00:53:08,071 --> 00:53:09,380
I mean, I know the prom's kind of lame,

925
00:53:09,445 --> 00:53:11,868
so if you don't wanna go,
it's really no big deal.

926
00:53:44,581 --> 00:53:45,859
Hey. What?

927
00:53:46,821 --> 00:53:49,536
It happened! He asked me.

928
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:52,509
- And?
- I accepted!

929
00:53:52,582 --> 00:53:54,076
Well, congratulations.

930
00:53:54,405 --> 00:53:58,300
No more moping around the house
waiting for the telephone to ring.

931
00:53:59,429 --> 00:54:01,436
So you in love?

932
00:54:04,614 --> 00:54:07,482
- Yeah, I think I am.
- Well, who is this guy?

933
00:54:08,423 --> 00:54:12,000
His name is Blane and he's a senior.
He's so beautiful.

934
00:54:13,926 --> 00:54:15,682
He's a richie.

935
00:54:16,646 --> 00:54:18,979
- A whatie?
- A richie.

936
00:54:19,046 --> 00:54:21,860
It's kind of stupid.
It's just his family has a lot of money.

937
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:23,964
Oh, well, is that a problem?

938
00:54:24,133 --> 00:54:25,476
I don't know. It's just weird, you know.

939
00:54:25,541 --> 00:54:28,408
His friends have a lot of money,
and he has a lot of money.

940
00:54:28,485 --> 00:54:30,175
He drives a BMW.

941
00:54:30,821 --> 00:54:34,083
Just, I don't know. I'm not really sure
if they're gonna accept me.

942
00:54:35,109 --> 00:54:36,538
Well, what does that mean?

943
00:54:36,612 --> 00:54:39,000
I mean, you like him. He likes you.

944
00:54:39,332 --> 00:54:41,720
What his friends think
shouldn't make any difference.

945
00:54:41,795 --> 00:54:44,729
Yeah, but it's not just his friends.
It's my friends, too. It's everybody!

946
00:54:44,804 --> 00:54:47,171
I'm just not real secure about it.

947
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:49,635
Well, so take the heat.

948
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,417
I mean, you like him. He likes you.
It's worth it.

949
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:53,530
Is it?

950
00:54:53,828 --> 00:54:55,255
Well, isn't it?

951
00:54:57,221 --> 00:54:58,465
You're right.

952
00:55:00,387 --> 00:55:01,981
I'm just overreacting, aren't I?

953
00:55:02,052 --> 00:55:03,546
Well, not necessarily.

954
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:07,164
I mean, a good kiss can scramble
anybody's brain.

955
00:55:08,965 --> 00:55:11,168
Look, just don't worry about it,
you know.

956
00:55:11,234 --> 00:55:13,145
And wait and see
how you feel tomorrow.

957
00:55:13,731 --> 00:55:16,066
- Good night, honey.
- Good night, thanks.

958
00:55:16,387 --> 00:55:17,850
That's my baby.

959
00:55:21,444 --> 00:55:22,588
Honey.

960
00:55:25,029 --> 00:55:27,069
Wait a minute.
Could I ask you something?

961
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:28,186
Yeah.

962
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:34,170
Yeah, sometimes I feel a little sorry

963
00:55:34,243 --> 00:55:38,018
that I'm the one you have to talk to
about these things.

964
00:55:38,083 --> 00:55:39,260
I'm not.

965
00:55:40,098 --> 00:55:42,465
She couldn't have said it
any better than you.

966
00:55:42,529 --> 00:55:43,676
I mean it.

967
00:55:44,036 --> 00:55:45,180
Good night.

968
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:43,096
Okay, make my day.

969
00:56:43,363 --> 00:56:45,695
I want all the gory details.

970
00:56:45,763 --> 00:56:48,895
The mingling breath, pounding heart,

971
00:56:48,963 --> 00:56:51,777
the steaming windows.
I want the whole skidoo.

972
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:54,428
Well, I hate to disappoint you,
but nothing happened.

973
00:56:55,841 --> 00:56:57,051
Nothing?

974
00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:00,799
Well, not nothing. I mean, I kissed him.

975
00:57:02,274 --> 00:57:05,339
- Anywhere interesting?
- Oh, please.

976
00:57:06,655 --> 00:57:07,901
So

977
00:57:09,314 --> 00:57:10,624
does he have

978
00:57:11,586 --> 00:57:13,146
strong lips?

979
00:57:13,441 --> 00:57:14,968
How can you tell?

980
00:57:15,042 --> 00:57:16,829
Do you feel it in your knees?

981
00:57:17,218 --> 00:57:18,777
I felt it everywhere.

982
00:57:19,392 --> 00:57:20,888
Strong lips.

983
00:57:27,072 --> 00:57:28,634
Talk about lips.

984
00:57:30,787 --> 00:57:32,726
I mean, I'm old enough to be his mother,

985
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,256
but when the Duck laid that kiss on me
last night,

986
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:39,104
I swear to God,
my thighs just went up in flames.

987
00:57:39,904 --> 00:57:42,205
He must practice on melons
or something.

988
00:57:42,753 --> 00:57:44,345
Is this your prom dress?

989
00:57:47,104 --> 00:57:49,690
- Believe it or not.
- No, it's great.

990
00:57:50,146 --> 00:57:52,533
- It's silly.
- It's a great material.

991
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,402
You know, I'm going.

992
00:57:58,177 --> 00:57:59,454
To prom.

993
00:58:00,832 --> 00:58:02,208
Stop it.

994
00:58:02,785 --> 00:58:05,598
No, I am. Last night he asked me,

995
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,415
and I don't know, I said yes.

996
00:58:09,055 --> 00:58:10,747
Seems really weird,

997
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,756
but it might be kind of fun.

998
00:58:15,392 --> 00:58:19,190
You were here for 15 minutes,
and you didn't even tell me!

999
00:58:19,423 --> 00:58:21,464
I really, really wanted to go.

1000
00:58:27,265 --> 00:58:28,760
You lucky girl.

1001
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:37,115
Isn't that a dreamy dress?

1002
00:58:54,433 --> 00:58:56,122
Lona, I have to go.

1003
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:58,557
Can you just hold it
till this song is over?

1004
00:58:59,294 --> 00:59:01,018
But I have to leave.

1005
00:59:01,758 --> 00:59:06,166
Oh, why can't we start old
and get younger?

1006
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:12,308
I envy you.

1007
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:15,066
I really envy you!

1008
00:59:17,214 --> 00:59:19,517
Lona, you're gonna OD on nostalgia.

1009
00:59:21,023 --> 00:59:22,778
I loved The Big Chill.

1010
00:59:23,967 --> 00:59:25,493
I love this dress.

1011
00:59:25,598 --> 00:59:27,834
- It's a great dress.
- Yeah.

1012
00:59:28,990 --> 00:59:32,699
My mother bought it for me.
God, she was so happy.

1013
00:59:33,727 --> 00:59:36,629
It was the first and last time
I ever looked normal.

1014
00:59:36,704 --> 00:59:38,742
I mean, you know, relatively speaking.

1015
00:59:39,389 --> 00:59:40,503
It would've been a fairytale

1016
00:59:40,574 --> 00:59:43,160
if my date hadn't been
the only one at the prom

1017
00:59:43,615 --> 00:59:45,524
with a wife and two kids.

1018
00:59:48,063 --> 00:59:51,575
You wanna try it on?
I bet it'd look great on you.

1019
00:59:51,711 --> 00:59:54,099
I mean, your butt is 15 years
younger than mine.

1020
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:56,443
I mean, I used to have a great butt.

1021
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:58,747
I did! I loved my butt!

1022
00:59:58,813 --> 01:00:00,984
I wish I had photographs of it.
You wanna try this on?

1023
01:00:01,054 --> 01:00:02,746
No, not right now.

1024
01:00:02,879 --> 01:00:05,366
Oh, yeah, you got to go. I know. I know.

1025
01:00:06,047 --> 01:00:07,869
- I gotta get ready myself.
- You're going out?

1026
01:00:07,936 --> 01:00:09,592
Yeah. New guy.

1027
01:00:10,654 --> 01:00:13,046
Terrence, owns a pet shop.

1028
01:00:13,535 --> 01:00:15,289
We'll see what happens.

1029
01:00:16,862 --> 01:00:18,072
Have fun.

1030
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:21,213
- Give Mr. Perfecto a squeeze for me.
- Oh, I will.

1031
01:00:22,271 --> 01:00:23,612
Hey, and listen,

1032
01:00:24,766 --> 01:00:27,994
if you see your little Duck Man, be kind.

1033
01:00:28,382 --> 01:00:31,098
He's nursing
some fairly serious wounds.

1034
01:00:31,518 --> 01:00:34,072
- Okay?
- Okay.

1035
01:00:34,783 --> 01:00:36,756
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

1036
01:00:40,159 --> 01:00:42,580
Hey, you know, we're going for sushi.

1037
01:00:43,997 --> 01:00:46,004
Do you think this is too much?

1038
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:49,235
Bye.

1039
01:00:55,262 --> 01:00:57,879
Thought that was very uncool of you
last night, Blane.

1040
01:00:57,951 --> 01:00:59,542
- What?
- What?

1041
01:01:00,831 --> 01:01:03,131
- You mean Andie?
- Yeah, I mean Andie.

1042
01:01:03,358 --> 01:01:05,300
What's the big deal? I like her.

1043
01:01:05,503 --> 01:01:08,567
Matter of fact, I was pissed off
at you guys for being so nasty to her.

1044
01:01:08,637 --> 01:01:11,801
It was way out of order for you
to foist her on the party.

1045
01:01:11,868 --> 01:01:13,875
Steff, you hear yourself?

1046
01:01:13,949 --> 01:01:15,802
You hear the same asshole shit I hear?

1047
01:01:15,868 --> 01:01:17,908
What, do I have to spell it out
for you, Blane?

1048
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:19,159
I guess so.

1049
01:01:19,453 --> 01:01:21,909
Nobody appreciates
your sense of humor, you know.

1050
01:01:21,981 --> 01:01:24,567
As a matter of fact, everybody is
just about to puke from you.

1051
01:01:24,635 --> 01:01:26,423
You know, if you got a hard-on for trash,

1052
01:01:26,495 --> 01:01:29,011
don't take care of it around us, pal,
all right?

1053
01:01:29,086 --> 01:01:30,491
Right, buddy.

1054
01:01:30,878 --> 01:01:34,390
Listen, I don't need a lot of shit on
this one, Blane, all right? I really don't.

1055
01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:38,066
Money all that matters to you?

1056
01:01:38,139 --> 01:01:40,529
Where the hell does that come from?

1057
01:01:40,602 --> 01:01:42,907
Come on, look around you.
Would I treat my parents' house like this

1058
01:01:42,972 --> 01:01:45,012
if money was any kind of issue?

1059
01:01:45,403 --> 01:01:46,679
Come on, why are you doing this?

1060
01:01:46,749 --> 01:01:49,137
You know, why don't you just nail her
and get it over with?

1061
01:01:49,211 --> 01:01:50,706
You know, why are you getting involved?

1062
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:52,122
Is there something wrong with that?

1063
01:01:52,188 --> 01:01:54,904
I just think it's stupid.
You know, it's pointless.

1064
01:01:54,972 --> 01:01:57,242
You know, and your parents,
I think they'll be thrilled.

1065
01:01:57,308 --> 01:01:58,292
They have nothing to do with it.

1066
01:01:58,365 --> 01:01:59,312
- Really?
- Yeah.

1067
01:01:59,389 --> 01:02:03,031
I've seen your mother go to work on you,
Blane. You know, it's vicious.

1068
01:02:03,099 --> 01:02:04,856
And when Bill and Joyce
get through with you,

1069
01:02:04,923 --> 01:02:07,443
you won't know whether to shit
or go sailing.

1070
01:02:08,282 --> 01:02:12,539
Listen, I'm getting really bored
with this conversation, all right, Blane?

1071
01:02:12,603 --> 01:02:15,985
You know, if you want your little
piece of low-grade ass, fine, take it.

1072
01:02:16,058 --> 01:02:18,362
You know, but if you do,
you're not gonna have a friend.

1073
01:02:18,428 --> 01:02:20,883
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

1074
01:02:22,586 --> 01:02:25,141
I mean, if you want to make the choice,
go ahead, make it, all right?

1075
01:02:25,212 --> 01:02:27,960
I personally wouldn't trash
a friendship over it.

1076
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:30,960
But, hey, I'm old-fashioned, so...

1077
01:02:31,546 --> 01:02:34,513
Why don't you take a shower?
You look like shit.

1078
01:02:36,442 --> 01:02:39,540
If two weeks ago, somebody had
told me that I'd be going out with you,

1079
01:02:39,611 --> 01:02:40,920
I never would have believed them.

1080
01:02:41,786 --> 01:02:43,313
Why? I'm not all that bad.

1081
01:02:43,386 --> 01:02:45,777
- No, but...
- What about me and you?

1082
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:50,616
You know, it's so insane
that somebody you've never met,

1083
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:53,138
never talked to, can be your enemy.

1084
01:02:57,786 --> 01:02:58,735
Yep.

1085
01:03:03,289 --> 01:03:05,395
You shouldn't meet my parents then.

1086
01:03:05,979 --> 01:03:07,059
Okay.

1087
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:10,451
Well, I mean, they're not ogres,

1088
01:03:13,499 --> 01:03:16,531
but I think they still believe
in arranged marriages.

1089
01:03:17,563 --> 01:03:20,280
Corporate families
replaced royal families.

1090
01:03:20,953 --> 01:03:23,768
I'm the crowned prince
of McDonnagh Electric.

1091
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:26,962
- It's irrelevant.
- No.

1092
01:03:31,547 --> 01:03:32,595
Yeah.

1093
01:03:36,443 --> 01:03:39,607
- I could just tell them all to go to hell.
- Tell them to go to hell.

1094
01:03:39,673 --> 01:03:41,530
- Everyone, friends, parents.
- All of them.

1095
01:03:41,594 --> 01:03:42,803
All of them.

1096
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:46,033
What about you?

1097
01:03:48,281 --> 01:03:51,858
If somebody doesn't believe in me,
I can't believe in them.

1098
01:03:54,938 --> 01:03:56,497
You don't lie, do you?

1099
01:03:57,466 --> 01:03:59,124
I don't have to lie.

1100
01:04:04,986 --> 01:04:06,742
This is gonna happen.

1101
01:04:08,027 --> 01:04:10,098
Okay, I really want this to happen.

1102
01:04:44,023 --> 01:04:45,104
Yeah.

1103
01:05:35,574 --> 01:05:37,965
- Can I help you?
- I'm fine, thank you.

1104
01:05:38,103 --> 01:05:39,794
Something for the prom?

1105
01:05:39,862 --> 01:05:41,009
Just looking.

1106
01:05:41,719 --> 01:05:43,826
Yeah, well, if you need anything...

1107
01:06:05,815 --> 01:06:07,441
This is trash.

1108
01:06:07,512 --> 01:06:09,300
It's very becoming.

1109
01:06:09,367 --> 01:06:12,848
Mother, it looks like I should be
standing on top of a wedding cake.

1110
01:06:12,918 --> 01:06:14,861
Oh, darling, don't I wish.

1111
01:06:14,998 --> 01:06:16,340
And I hate this material.

1112
01:06:16,408 --> 01:06:18,741
And by the way,
I cannot stand baby blue.

1113
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:36,685
Well, do you know where he is?

1114
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:39,540
No, I'm sorry,
he didn't tell me where he was going.

1115
01:06:39,703 --> 01:06:42,866
Okay, well, then if he calls or comes
home, can you just tell him to call me?

1116
01:06:42,935 --> 01:06:44,277
- Who is this, please?
- Andie.

1117
01:06:44,471 --> 01:06:45,681
- Who?
- Andie.

1118
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:48,271
- Well, yes, could I have your number?
- Yeah, no, he has the number.

1119
01:06:48,342 --> 01:06:50,198
Well, fine, I'll leave him a note, dear.

1120
01:06:50,262 --> 01:06:51,668
Okay, thanks, bye.

1121
01:06:55,446 --> 01:06:57,269
Where the hell is he?

1122
01:07:02,422 --> 01:07:04,910
Don't fall in love, Ace.
You just won't like it.

1123
01:07:04,983 --> 01:07:06,770
It's very complicated.

1124
01:07:31,158 --> 01:07:32,105
Andie!

1125
01:07:37,749 --> 01:07:38,996
Andie!

1126
01:07:42,582 --> 01:07:44,687
- Andie.
- Come in.

1127
01:07:47,349 --> 01:07:48,691
- Hi.
- Hi, Daddy.

1128
01:07:48,755 --> 01:07:50,382
I brought you something.

1129
01:07:51,251 --> 01:07:52,365
What is it?

1130
01:07:52,436 --> 01:07:55,253
Oh, just a little something
I picked up for you.

1131
01:07:58,773 --> 01:07:59,786
Now, I know it's a little busy,

1132
01:07:59,861 --> 01:08:02,511
but I know you can make
something out of it, if you need to.

1133
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:04,587
- Wow.
- Yeah, do you like it?

1134
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,147
- It's a beautiful color.
- Yeah.

1135
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:08,627
- It's really pretty.
- Yeah.

1136
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:11,562
God, it reminds me
so much of your mom.

1137
01:08:12,148 --> 01:08:14,058
You know, she always wore pink,

1138
01:08:14,643 --> 01:08:16,684
and she looked so beautiful in it.

1139
01:08:16,914 --> 01:08:18,225
- It's okay.
- Okay.

1140
01:08:18,452 --> 01:08:19,915
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1141
01:08:22,197 --> 01:08:24,051
- Daddy.
- What?

1142
01:08:25,429 --> 01:08:27,665
I just want you to know
I really appreciate this.

1143
01:08:27,731 --> 01:08:30,417
You know,
I think I can make something out of it.

1144
01:08:32,628 --> 01:08:35,595
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure. What?

1145
01:08:39,477 --> 01:08:41,896
Where'd you get the money
to pay for this?

1146
01:08:42,292 --> 01:08:44,495
Well, it wasn't that much.
I had some money.

1147
01:08:44,561 --> 01:08:46,026
From your new job?

1148
01:08:46,451 --> 01:08:48,142
Yeah, from my new job.

1149
01:08:50,036 --> 01:08:51,693
I came home before work
on Wednesday,

1150
01:08:51,764 --> 01:08:53,554
and your car was in the driveway.

1151
01:08:55,828 --> 01:08:57,320
You know, you didn't have to lie to me.

1152
01:08:57,396 --> 01:08:58,575
- Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't.

1153
01:08:58,644 --> 01:08:59,853
Yes, I did. I had a line on something,

1154
01:08:59,923 --> 01:09:00,872
and I missed the appointment.

1155
01:09:00,947 --> 01:09:03,436
- Oh, why'd you miss the appointment?
- It slipped my mind.

1156
01:09:03,508 --> 01:09:05,327
It didn't slip your mind.
You didn't want the job.

1157
01:09:05,395 --> 01:09:07,947
You just went to the counselor
because I forced you to. Am I right?

1158
01:09:08,019 --> 01:09:09,329
Yeah, what's your point, Andie?

1159
01:09:09,394 --> 01:09:11,305
My point is you just didn't go!

1160
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:13,320
You saying I deliberately
missed the appointment?

1161
01:09:13,395 --> 01:09:14,344
Yes.

1162
01:09:15,187 --> 01:09:17,326
Is this how you feel about me?

1163
01:09:18,901 --> 01:09:19,848
Yes.

1164
01:09:20,883 --> 01:09:23,816
- Well, I didn't know this.
- Well, now you do.

1165
01:09:24,756 --> 01:09:26,578
Oh, you know everything, now, huh?

1166
01:09:26,644 --> 01:09:29,361
You're 18, and you've got a scholarship,

1167
01:09:29,427 --> 01:09:31,334
- That's not fair.
...and you're grown up and free,

1168
01:09:31,410 --> 01:09:32,720
and I'm just an ignorant son of a bitch

1169
01:09:32,786 --> 01:09:35,122
- that never gave you anything.
- Hey, I never asked for anything.

1170
01:09:35,186 --> 01:09:36,397
Oh, that's brilliant!

1171
01:09:36,465 --> 01:09:38,409
Why can't you just forget her?

1172
01:09:38,769 --> 01:09:40,047
It's late. You got school.

1173
01:09:40,116 --> 01:09:42,797
No, don't walk out on this!
Will you please just listen to me?

1174
01:09:42,867 --> 01:09:44,974
- Please?
- I've already been through this, Andie.

1175
01:09:45,043 --> 01:09:47,629
Sure, you go through it every day!
You're still going through it!

1176
01:09:47,699 --> 01:09:49,771
Why can't you just realize
that she's gone,

1177
01:09:49,842 --> 01:09:51,305
and she's not gonna come back?

1178
01:09:51,378 --> 01:09:53,103
She's never coming back!

1179
01:09:53,171 --> 01:09:55,724
- Shut up! God damn it!
- Why can't you accept it?

1180
01:09:55,794 --> 01:09:57,614
She's just gone! She...

1181
01:09:58,387 --> 01:10:00,327
Why can't you accept it?

1182
01:10:01,618 --> 01:10:05,195
Because I love her, that's why.

1183
01:10:06,003 --> 01:10:08,238
Well, I loved her, too, you know.

1184
01:10:10,547 --> 01:10:12,401
She just didn't love us back.

1185
01:10:18,034 --> 01:10:19,496
Okay, she tried.

1186
01:10:20,210 --> 01:10:22,577
I don't know, she just couldn't handle it.

1187
01:10:22,641 --> 01:10:25,096
Yeah, but I knew it.

1188
01:10:25,265 --> 01:10:26,957
I knew it all along.

1189
01:10:27,155 --> 01:10:29,160
I mean, when I was five, I felt it.

1190
01:10:30,001 --> 01:10:32,370
Remember when she didn't come home
that time?

1191
01:10:33,393 --> 01:10:34,888
I knew it then. I knew why.

1192
01:10:34,962 --> 01:10:38,541
I was 14 and I knew it.
You were 50 and you didn't.

1193
01:10:39,153 --> 01:10:42,383
You know, you can't go on
living every day in the past.

1194
01:10:43,665 --> 01:10:45,576
She left us, Daddy. We didn't leave her.

1195
01:10:45,651 --> 01:10:48,684
There was nothing we could do about it.
It just happened.

1196
01:10:51,345 --> 01:10:54,761
Since when is a daughter supposed
to know more than her father?

1197
01:10:57,457 --> 01:10:59,824
I've just been a blind fool.

1198
01:11:01,394 --> 01:11:04,393
And you're a blind fool
that needs a shave, too, you know that?

1199
01:11:04,466 --> 01:11:06,089
And I need a shave.

1200
01:11:08,274 --> 01:11:09,453
Well,

1201
01:11:10,992 --> 01:11:13,196
you better get to bed. You got school.

1202
01:11:13,584 --> 01:11:14,993
And I gotta hit the hay, too,

1203
01:11:15,056 --> 01:11:18,886
'cause I got a few things
I gotta do tomorrow, okay?

1204
01:11:19,152 --> 01:11:20,201
Okay.

1205
01:11:25,904 --> 01:11:29,003
I would've got you some shoes,
but I didn't know your size.

1206
01:12:40,815 --> 01:12:41,762
Melanie.

1207
01:13:01,903 --> 01:13:03,113
How you doing?

1208
01:13:03,663 --> 01:13:05,354
Why haven't you called me?

1209
01:13:05,422 --> 01:13:07,115
Oh, I got nailed for the stable thing.

1210
01:13:07,183 --> 01:13:09,552
I guess a groom saw us.
It's against club rules.

1211
01:13:09,615 --> 01:13:12,068
I called you three times,
and I left messages.

1212
01:13:12,783 --> 01:13:13,766
Yeah?

1213
01:13:14,062 --> 01:13:15,209
Well, I didn't get them.

1214
01:13:15,279 --> 01:13:18,127
My family, they're irresponsible
about that stuff, you know.

1215
01:13:18,446 --> 01:13:20,303
I waited for you this morning.

1216
01:13:21,104 --> 01:13:23,143
- Yeah? Where?
- Parking lot.

1217
01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:28,101
I saw you,
and I thought that you saw me.

1218
01:13:29,869 --> 01:13:30,820
No.

1219
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:34,629
What about prom, Blane?

1220
01:13:37,038 --> 01:13:39,045
Oh, Andie, I'm having a bad day.
Can we talk later?

1221
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:40,906
No. What about prom?

1222
01:13:40,973 --> 01:13:42,088
Come on.
Why don't we just meet after school?

1223
01:13:42,158 --> 01:13:44,679
- No! What about prom?
- Andie, come on.

1224
01:13:44,781 --> 01:13:45,860
- Just say it.
- What?

1225
01:13:45,935 --> 01:13:48,803
Just say it! I want to hear you say it.

1226
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:51,881
Andie, please, all right.

1227
01:13:52,046 --> 01:13:53,671
I wanna hear you say it!

1228
01:13:56,815 --> 01:13:59,113
A month ago I asked somebody else,
and I forgot.

1229
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:00,327
You're a liar!

1230
01:14:00,397 --> 01:14:02,286
You're a filthy, fucking, no-good liar!

1231
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:04,421
You don't have the guts
to tell me the truth!

1232
01:14:04,492 --> 01:14:05,868
- Just say it!
- I'm not lying.

1233
01:14:05,933 --> 01:14:06,948
- Tell me!
- What?

1234
01:14:07,022 --> 01:14:08,166
- Tell me!
- What do you wanna hear?

1235
01:14:08,238 --> 01:14:09,828
- Just tell me!
- What?

1236
01:14:09,903 --> 01:14:11,877
- You're ashamed to be seen with me!
- No, I am not!

1237
01:14:11,950 --> 01:14:13,445
- You're ashamed to go out with me!
- I am not.

1238
01:14:13,518 --> 01:14:14,466
- You're afraid.
- No, I am...

1239
01:14:14,541 --> 01:14:17,290
You're terrified your goddamn
rich friends won't approve!

1240
01:14:17,356 --> 01:14:20,322
Just say it! Just tell me the truth!

1241
01:14:24,844 --> 01:14:28,105
You don't understand that
it has nothing at all to do with you.

1242
01:14:29,358 --> 01:14:30,337
Andie!

1243
01:14:32,397 --> 01:14:33,512
Andie!

1244
01:14:52,715 --> 01:14:55,880
Forget about it, man.
It's not worth getting upset over.

1245
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:57,802
Why don't you just take off, Steff?
Please.

1246
01:14:57,870 --> 01:14:59,243
Well, listen, any girl that did that to me

1247
01:14:59,308 --> 01:15:02,155
I would not be too jazzed
to hold onto, Blane.

1248
01:15:03,211 --> 01:15:05,832
It's not worth it, man. I told you
it wasn't gonna work, you know.

1249
01:15:05,901 --> 01:15:08,585
The girl was, is
and will always be nada.

1250
01:15:39,691 --> 01:15:41,348
You got a problem, friend?

1251
01:15:59,371 --> 01:16:00,387
Come on.

1252
01:16:14,955 --> 01:16:16,416
All right! All right!

1253
01:16:27,147 --> 01:16:28,519
That's nice, huh?

1254
01:16:44,685 --> 01:16:45,829
Andie?

1255
01:16:46,761 --> 01:16:48,738
- Yeah?
- You're Andie, aren't you?

1256
01:16:48,876 --> 01:16:51,263
Yeah, I am. How do you know me?

1257
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:53,410
Well, lona told me. I'm Terrence.

1258
01:16:53,771 --> 01:16:54,717
Terry.

1259
01:16:54,794 --> 01:16:56,680
Oh, the pet shop. Right?

1260
01:16:56,746 --> 01:16:57,924
Yeah, among other things.

1261
01:16:57,994 --> 01:16:59,519
She's in the bedroom getting ready.

1262
01:16:59,595 --> 01:17:01,733
You might wanna go in there
and tell her to shake her tail feather.

1263
01:17:01,801 --> 01:17:03,689
- We're late.
- Okay.

1264
01:17:07,274 --> 01:17:08,220
Iona?

1265
01:17:11,051 --> 01:17:12,360
Nice to meet you.

1266
01:17:27,626 --> 01:17:30,593
- Iona?
- Hi, honey, I'm in here.

1267
01:17:32,713 --> 01:17:34,370
Laugh and I'll deck you.

1268
01:17:34,441 --> 01:17:35,870
What happened?

1269
01:17:37,706 --> 01:17:40,072
Either it's all those drugs
I took in the '60s,

1270
01:17:40,139 --> 01:17:42,627
or I am really in love.

1271
01:17:44,775 --> 01:17:46,785
What do you think? Honestly.

1272
01:17:47,464 --> 01:17:49,537
Honestly, I think you look great.

1273
01:17:50,184 --> 01:17:51,526
Oh, I look like a mother.

1274
01:17:51,593 --> 01:17:55,170
No. Well, yeah, a little, but that's okay.

1275
01:17:56,521 --> 01:17:57,981
You look happy.

1276
01:17:58,857 --> 01:17:59,904
I am.

1277
01:18:01,257 --> 01:18:03,592
It's weird, but I... Did you meet him?

1278
01:18:03,659 --> 01:18:05,566
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1279
01:18:06,187 --> 01:18:09,732
He's a yuppie, but he's so nice.

1280
01:18:09,801 --> 01:18:12,136
He's employed. He's heterosexual.

1281
01:18:12,201 --> 01:18:15,135
I swear to God, I'm so far ahead
of the game, next time you see me

1282
01:18:15,207 --> 01:18:17,793
I'll probably be picking out
my china pattern or something.

1283
01:18:20,392 --> 01:18:22,661
Hey, are you all right? No, you're not.

1284
01:18:23,623 --> 01:18:26,372
- What, did I blow your mind?
- No, that's not it.

1285
01:18:27,145 --> 01:18:28,421
Is it boy trouble?

1286
01:18:29,769 --> 01:18:32,157
- The worst?
- Way beyond.

1287
01:18:32,743 --> 01:18:34,403
He backed out on me.

1288
01:18:35,241 --> 01:18:38,536
He said he asked somebody else,
and he forgot about it.

1289
01:18:40,263 --> 01:18:43,078
I can't believe it. I can't believe it.

1290
01:18:46,311 --> 01:18:48,100
I'm so humiliated.

1291
01:18:49,385 --> 01:18:51,587
I could've killed him! I swear!

1292
01:18:52,264 --> 01:18:54,303
You know, I just walked right into it.

1293
01:18:54,376 --> 01:18:56,547
No, no.

1294
01:18:57,447 --> 01:19:00,198
Oh, love is awful, isn't it?

1295
01:19:02,663 --> 01:19:04,006
It's okay.

1296
01:19:13,224 --> 01:19:15,612
You remember when I...
And when you said that

1297
01:19:15,687 --> 01:19:18,109
if I wanted your prom dress
I could have it?

1298
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:21,054
Well, I need it. I want it.

1299
01:19:23,112 --> 01:19:25,600
- What for?
- I just need it.

1300
01:19:27,913 --> 01:19:28,959
Okay.

1301
01:19:32,165 --> 01:19:33,509
It's yours.

1302
01:21:11,684 --> 01:21:14,335
Oh, my God. Look at you.

1303
01:21:16,229 --> 01:21:17,372
Another first.

1304
01:21:17,444 --> 01:21:19,647
Your guy's gonna fall to the floor
when he comes in.

1305
01:21:19,716 --> 01:21:20,926
No, he won't.

1306
01:21:21,029 --> 01:21:22,369
The hell he's not.

1307
01:21:22,853 --> 01:21:25,338
No, he really won't. He's not coming.

1308
01:21:25,829 --> 01:21:27,649
- What?
- It's okay.

1309
01:21:28,485 --> 01:21:30,722
- I'm gonna go.
- Alone?

1310
01:21:31,491 --> 01:21:33,860
Yeah, I'm not sad about it. I'm not hurt.

1311
01:21:34,436 --> 01:21:37,022
I mean, you know, I am hurt a little bit.

1312
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:39,738
But I know if I don't do it
I'll just feel a lot worse.

1313
01:21:39,813 --> 01:21:43,108
I'm just gonna go in,
walk in, walk out and come home.

1314
01:21:44,101 --> 01:21:45,048
You sure?

1315
01:21:47,428 --> 01:21:49,338
I just wanna let them know
that they didn't break me.

1316
01:22:30,117 --> 01:22:31,676
- Open up.
- Thank you.

1317
01:22:32,706 --> 01:22:33,887
You're such trash.

1318
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:48,280
Well, as soon as anybody's ready
to go upstairs and get serious,

1319
01:22:48,356 --> 01:22:49,698
just let me know.

1320
01:22:49,763 --> 01:22:51,585
We've only been here an hour.

1321
01:22:51,747 --> 01:22:54,464
We can go up and come back
down again, Benny, all right.

1322
01:22:54,529 --> 01:22:56,473
Did you look at the suite?

1323
01:22:56,899 --> 01:23:00,512
It's $300 a night, Benny.
It's not gonna be a palace, okay?

1324
01:23:00,931 --> 01:23:02,526
I think we should stay for a while.

1325
01:23:02,595 --> 01:23:05,280
We're not gonna see these people
for much longer.

1326
01:23:05,796 --> 01:23:07,902
Come on, it's kind of the end, okay?

1327
01:23:08,386 --> 01:23:10,527
I don't give a shit what you do.

1328
01:23:42,403 --> 01:23:43,351
Damn it.

1329
01:24:22,112 --> 01:24:23,061
Oh, my God!

1330
01:24:26,272 --> 01:24:27,898
You're here! What happened?

1331
01:24:27,967 --> 01:24:31,480
- Well, I guess you're looking at it.
- Oh, wow, you look great.

1332
01:24:32,450 --> 01:24:34,937
Thanks, you look stunning, really.

1333
01:24:35,809 --> 01:24:37,217
It's breathtaking.

1334
01:24:38,561 --> 01:24:40,254
No, and listen, I want you to know,

1335
01:24:40,321 --> 01:24:42,591
despite my appearance at this function,

1336
01:24:43,138 --> 01:24:46,485
I remain now and will always be
a Duck Man.

1337
01:24:52,673 --> 01:24:54,394
May I admire you?

1338
01:24:54,752 --> 01:24:56,760
Oh, if you wish.

1339
01:25:00,510 --> 01:25:01,887
Let's plow.

1340
01:25:42,238 --> 01:25:43,548
Should we dance?

1341
01:25:45,248 --> 01:25:46,905
It wouldn't be unheard of.

1342
01:25:51,582 --> 01:25:53,722
A little, lingering doubt perhaps, Blane?

1343
01:25:54,591 --> 01:25:56,086
You know,
you gotta give her credit though.

1344
01:25:56,161 --> 01:25:57,850
I mean, after you dumped her,

1345
01:25:57,918 --> 01:25:59,326
she certainly went out and found herself

1346
01:25:59,392 --> 01:26:02,491
what I'd have to say is probably
the most interesting date

1347
01:26:02,559 --> 01:26:04,249
- that our generation...
- Steff.

1348
01:26:07,071 --> 01:26:08,280
You buy everything, Steff.

1349
01:26:08,351 --> 01:26:10,652
You couldn't buy her, though.
That's what's killing you, isn't it?

1350
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:12,890
- I don't wanna listen to this.
- Steff.

1351
01:26:13,406 --> 01:26:14,902
That's it, Steff.

1352
01:26:16,287 --> 01:26:18,044
She thinks you're shit,

1353
01:26:19,519 --> 01:26:21,787
and deep down you know she's right.

1354
01:26:35,806 --> 01:26:36,755
Hi.

1355
01:26:38,143 --> 01:26:39,091
Hi.

1356
01:26:51,998 --> 01:26:54,365
You don't need me to say I'm sorry.

1357
01:26:54,814 --> 01:26:57,749
It's done. It's over with. I'm fine.

1358
01:26:59,869 --> 01:27:02,140
Oh, well, if that's true, then I'm glad.

1359
01:27:07,837 --> 01:27:09,269
It's not true.

1360
01:27:10,557 --> 01:27:12,500
It doesn't matter, does it?

1361
01:27:13,917 --> 01:27:15,413
You told me
you couldn't believe in somebody

1362
01:27:15,486 --> 01:27:17,941
who didn't believe in you.
I believed in you.

1363
01:27:18,302 --> 01:27:20,091
I always believed in you.

1364
01:27:21,118 --> 01:27:23,059
You just didn't believe in me.

1365
01:27:28,286 --> 01:27:29,562
I love you.

1366
01:27:36,094 --> 01:27:37,271
Always.

1367
01:27:45,597 --> 01:27:46,742
Andie,

1368
01:27:49,086 --> 01:27:50,611
he came here alone.

1369
01:27:54,109 --> 01:27:57,588
Okay, you're right.
He's not like the others.

1370
01:28:02,302 --> 01:28:03,958
If you don't go to him now,

1371
01:28:04,028 --> 01:28:05,917
I'm never gonna take you
to another prom ever again,

1372
01:28:05,981 --> 01:28:07,094
you hear me?

1373
01:28:07,582 --> 01:28:11,476
I mean, this is an incredibly romantic
moment, and you're ruining it for me.

1374
01:28:15,933 --> 01:28:17,174
Thanks, Duckie.

1375
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:21,271
Go ahead.

1376
01:28:21,272 --> 01:28:22,275
Blane.

1377
01:28:55,324 --> 01:28:56,436
Blane.

1378
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,077
