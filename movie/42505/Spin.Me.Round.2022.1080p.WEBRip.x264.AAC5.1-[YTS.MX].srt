00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:44,859
all over the country
on a all-expense paid trip

Institute in Italy.

Italian cuisine and culture.

I feel like I'm in a movie.

181
00:08:58,944 --> 00:09:01,208
Oh, wait.
Where are we going?

182
00:09:01,243 --> 00:09:02,682
I thought
we're staying there?

183
00:09:02,717 --> 00:09:05,080
Uh, yeah, no.
It says in the brochure --

184
00:09:05,115 --> 00:09:07,786
We have a hotel
where our managers stay.

185
00:09:07,821 --> 00:09:09,348
Don't worry, it's really nice.

186
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,119
Oh.
Oh, wow.

187
00:09:13,354 --> 00:09:14,694
That -- It --

188
00:09:17,831 --> 00:09:19,930

It's so great to be with you.

Welcome here to<i> giorno uno.</i>

201
00:10:27,868 --> 00:10:30,066
That's day one
of the Tuscan Grove

202
00:10:30,101 --> 00:10:32,365
Institute Exemplary
Managers' Program.

203
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,708
You should all be
very proud of yourselves.

204
00:10:34,743 --> 00:10:36,435
We're gonna have
a lot of fun here --

205
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,911
eat a lot of great food,
learn about Italian culture,

206
00:10:39,946 --> 00:10:43,244
and most importantly,
grow as people.

207
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,884
But first, everyone
introduce yourselves.

208
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,281
Tell us your name,
where you're from,

209
00:10:47,316 --> 00:10:49,052
and a fun fact
about yourself.

210
00:10:49,087 --> 00:10:51,890
Okay, that's dry.
I'll start.

211
00:10:51,925 --> 00:10:53,485
I'm Craig.

212
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,763
I, uh, come from Cincinnati, Ohio.

213
00:10:56,798 --> 00:10:58,424
But,
uh, I've been living

214
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:00,833
that ex-pat life
for eight years.

215
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,769
And, uh, let's see --

216
00:11:02,804 --> 00:11:05,464
my -- my great uncle
invented skorts.

217
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:06,806
"Sports"?

218
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:08,775
Skorts.
Okay.

219
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,139
Um, my name's Fran,

220
00:11:10,174 --> 00:11:12,812
and you all probably
recognize me

221
00:11:12,847 --> 00:11:15,914
from "Chef's Challenge."

222
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:17,443
And, uh --

223
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:19,511
Well, anyways,
I think of myself

224
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,282
as more than
just a manager.

225
00:11:21,317 --> 00:11:23,152
I guess
I'm a bit of a foodie.

226
00:11:23,187 --> 00:11:25,957
I've been dabbling
in molecular gastronomy

227
00:11:25,992 --> 00:11:28,223
and, I don't know,
just happy to be here

228
00:11:28,258 --> 00:11:30,060
to share
my expertise with y'all.

229
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:34,834
Oh.

230
00:11:37,168 --> 00:11:41,302
Um, I'm Dana, and, um,

231
00:11:41,337 --> 00:11:44,074
I've loved Tuscan Grove
since I was a kid.

232
00:11:44,109 --> 00:11:45,977
And I guess you could say

233
00:11:46,012 --> 00:11:47,979
that Nick Martucci's
kind of my idol.

234
00:11:48,014 --> 00:11:49,442
Just the way he, um --

235
00:11:49,477 --> 00:11:51,279
he built this business
from scratch.

236
00:11:51,314 --> 00:11:54,480
And he stars in those
beautiful commercials.

237
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:56,449
Um, I don't know --

238
00:11:56,484 --> 00:12:00,387
I-I'm just really psyched
to be here.

239
00:12:00,422 --> 00:12:02,994
I don't know.

240
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:05,425
I don't know.

241
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,097
I'm Jen.

242
00:12:07,132 --> 00:12:09,198
Uh, I'm from Oakland,
California,

243
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,199
and I am very --
- Oh, I'm sorry.

244
00:12:10,234 --> 00:12:11,365
I'm so sorry, I forgot.

245
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,005
I'm from Tenafly,
New Jersey.

246
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,810
Please continue.

247
00:12:16,845 --> 00:12:18,405
Did you --
Sorry, no, no.
You can go.

248
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,146
Um, I am really over
the moon to be here.

249
00:12:23,181 --> 00:12:25,214
I feel very connected to all
of you guys already, like,

250
00:12:25,249 --> 00:12:26,545
in this cosmic way.

251
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,316
Like we met in a past life
or something,

252
00:12:28,351 --> 00:12:30,153
and that's, like,
very exciting.

253
00:12:30,188 --> 00:12:33,552
And -- Oh, fun fact about me is,
I used to be a twin.

254
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:37,831
Uh, almost, because
my sister died in utero.

255
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:39,195
Cool.

256
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,428
That's not really a fun fact,
but, okay.

257
00:12:41,463 --> 00:12:45,168
Hi, everybody.
My name is Deb.

258
00:12:45,203 --> 00:12:47,137
I lost my bags at the airport,

259
00:12:47,172 --> 00:12:51,306
and I had all these really
important things in my suitcase.

260
00:12:51,341 --> 00:12:53,913
I called this woman with
the airlines and I spoke to her,

261
00:12:53,948 --> 00:12:55,409
and she was very rude to me.

262
00:12:55,444 --> 00:12:57,345
And she has no idea when
I'm gonna get my bags back,

263
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,951
or if they'll ever
find them again.

264
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:02,416
So, I just feel like
I'm not being very fun.

265
00:13:02,451 --> 00:13:03,615
Mm.

266
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,254
But, um, I really
appreciated Amber.

267
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:07,157
She was so kind, and you told me

268
00:13:07,192 --> 00:13:09,159
that you could lend me clothes,
and I really appreciate that.

269
00:13:09,194 --> 00:13:10,490
You seem like a nice person.

270
00:13:10,525 --> 00:13:12,360
Thank you.

271
00:13:12,395 --> 00:13:15,198
W-W-Well, I'm Amber.

272
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:17,937
I'm from Bakersfield,
California.

273
00:13:17,972 --> 00:13:21,974
Um, this is my first time
traveling outside the U.S.

274
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,538
I've worked at Tuscan Grove
for nine years.

275
00:13:25,573 --> 00:13:28,607
I technically took a year off
to open a restaurant, um,

276
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:30,213
with tablets
at every table,

277
00:13:30,248 --> 00:13:34,382
but my ex put all the debt
on my credit cards

278
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:36,351
and killed my credit,
and it went under, so I'm back.

279
00:13:36,386 --> 00:13:40,223
And...
now I'm here.

280
00:13:40,258 --> 00:13:42,357
Alright. Well, okay --
Okay, so I'm Susie.

281
00:13:42,392 --> 00:13:43,930
Oh, sorry.
I'm so sorry.

282
00:13:43,965 --> 00:13:46,229
Um, I'm from San Antonio,
Texas, so, "Go, Spurs."

283
00:13:46,264 --> 00:13:47,560
Um, yeah, I don't know --

284
00:13:47,595 --> 00:13:49,265
I've been at Tuscan Grove
for, like, ever --

285
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,938
since I was a little kid, like,
I've been working there.

286
00:13:51,973 --> 00:13:53,137
I mean, not, like,
for real-for real.

287
00:13:53,172 --> 00:13:55,502
Just for fun.
It's not like child labor.

288
00:13:55,537 --> 00:13:58,505
Um, but, like, my parents
and my, like, aunt and uncle,

289
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,309
they all have a franchise,
and they've had it forever.

290
00:14:00,344 --> 00:14:03,114
So, it's like all of us
work there -- my cousins --

291
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:05,248
There's 23 of us,
like, all together.

292
00:14:05,283 --> 00:14:06,348
We're just,
like, a big family,

293
00:14:06,383 --> 00:14:07,514
but we're all, like,
really close.

294
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:08,614
They're, like,
my best friends.

295
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:10,154
Oh, I love family.

296
00:14:10,189 --> 00:14:12,090
Yeah, no,
I mean, family rips.

297
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,586
- Great.

298
00:14:13,621 --> 00:14:15,929
So, now that we got the fun
stuff out of the way,

299
00:14:15,964 --> 00:14:18,998
I gotta --
I have to put on my serious hat.

300
00:14:19,033 --> 00:14:21,033
Italy's a magnificent country,

301
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,628
but, uh,
it can also be dangerous.

302
00:14:22,663 --> 00:14:24,696
That's why we have
a strict curfew.

303
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:27,501
How is Italy
dangerous, Craig?

304
00:14:27,536 --> 00:14:31,109
Uh, well, you know, there's
a lot of unpaved roads here,

305
00:14:31,144 --> 00:14:32,539
so you could slip and fall.

306
00:14:32,574 --> 00:14:34,409
You could, uh --
You could get lost.

307
00:14:34,444 --> 00:14:36,675
There are boars.

308
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,677
Boars?
Yeah.

309
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,119
There's no leaving the TG
Institute while you're here,

310
00:14:41,154 --> 00:14:44,155
except for official field trips,
which are so fun.

311
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,059
Yeah, okay, now I can take
the serious hat off

312
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,292
and I can put my fun
hat back on

313
00:14:49,327 --> 00:14:51,492
and introduce
a very special guest.

314
00:14:51,527 --> 00:14:54,198
Uh, please welcome one of
the most important members

315
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:55,397
of the Tuscan Grove family.

316
00:14:55,432 --> 00:14:57,234
She is personally responsible

317
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:59,632
for designing
the official TG menu.

318
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:02,173
No way.
Liz Bence is here?

319
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,438
Lizzie Bence.

320
00:15:03,473 --> 00:15:06,309
Oh, holy shit.

321
00:15:06,344 --> 00:15:08,179
Uh, I'm gonna faint.

322
00:15:08,214 --> 00:15:10,643
- Oh, please don't do that.
That's way too much pressure.

323
00:15:10,678 --> 00:15:12,183
Welcome, everyone.

324
00:15:12,218 --> 00:15:14,053
Congratulations
on making the cut.

325
00:15:14,088 --> 00:15:16,385
And speaking of cutting,
you all look hungry.

326
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,683
Let's get to the kitchen.
Come on.

327
00:15:17,718 --> 00:15:19,322
Ooh!

328
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,523
Alright, this is interesting.

329
00:15:22,558 --> 00:15:28,001
What is the different
between a ragu and a Bolognese?

330
00:15:28,036 --> 00:15:29,332
You don't have to
raise your hand.

331
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:33,732
Sorry, um, a Bolognese
is from Bologne?

332
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:37,142
Yes. What else?
What else?

333
00:15:37,177 --> 00:15:39,375
Ingredients?

334
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:42,048
Yes, but, uh, specifically.

335
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,545
Sauce?

336
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:48,483
Well, you're gonna use a red
wine for ragu and white wine...

337
00:15:48,518 --> 00:15:49,484
Uh, and white wine
for Bolognese.

338
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,617
...for Bolognese.

339
00:15:50,652 --> 00:15:53,125
- That's so interesting.

340
00:15:54,557 --> 00:15:58,130
Ooh, I love this.
This is fun.

341
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,462
Would that look cute?

342
00:16:00,497 --> 00:16:02,101
Yeah, you can take it --
sure.

343
00:16:02,136 --> 00:16:03,630
I think it would be so cute
with my jeans, you know?

344
00:16:03,665 --> 00:16:05,401
Mm-hmm.

345
00:16:05,436 --> 00:16:06,732
Oh, and there's some sweats
to sleep in, if you want.

346
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:10,340
Thank you so much.
I really like you, Amber.

347
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,738
Yeah. So, do you have
a boyfriend back home?

348
00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:14,575
No, definitely not.

349
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,577
Oh, that's okay.
You're still young, you know?

350
00:16:16,612 --> 00:16:18,117
You got plenty of time.

351
00:16:18,152 --> 00:16:19,514
You should just have fun
while you're here

352
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:21,681

But I'm actually married,

My husband, Hank,
is wonderful.

356
00:16:27,788 --> 00:16:29,458
He's --
He's really good for me.

357
00:16:29,493 --> 00:16:32,824
We actually have a really
good relationship -- very solid.

358
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:35,266
You're gonna find love, Amber.
I can feel it.

359
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:37,202
A lot of my friends say
I'm really intuitive.

360
00:16:37,237 --> 00:16:39,204
And you're my friend
now, so, mm.

361
00:16:40,768 --> 00:16:43,703
Oh, I just need to get this.
Are you good?

362
00:16:43,738 --> 00:16:45,705

Oh, yeah.
This is so cute.

374

really revealing
and sexy stuff.

376
00:17:14,505 --> 00:17:16,274

do anything while I'm here,

00:17:17,574 --> 00:17:19,244

need anything else?

379

No, it's fine.
Oh.

381
00:17:22,612 --> 00:17:24,150
It's actually really good
for my self-esteem, though,

382
00:17:24,185 --> 00:17:26,482
because I love
getting attention from men,

383
00:17:26,517 --> 00:17:29,716
and it's like that kind
of sexual energy, flirty --

384
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:32,323
Just makes
my body feel good.

385
00:17:32,358 --> 00:17:33,588
And then
you kind of, like,

386
00:17:33,623 --> 00:17:34,787

to the marriage.

387
00:17:34,822 --> 00:17:37,295

Oh, sorry.
Oh, yeah, okay.

Mm-hmm.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

398
00:17:59,781 --> 00:18:01,814
They didn't put any hangers
in my room, so --

00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:45,762
Do you have some
some liquid nitrogen here?

526
00:23:45,797 --> 00:23:47,830
It's really not
that kind of kitchen.

527
00:23:47,865 --> 00:23:49,832
Alright, let's use
some milk, then.

528
00:23:49,867 --> 00:23:51,966
And, okay.
We're mixing.

529
00:23:52,001 --> 00:23:55,233
You gotta get a real,
real quick mix going.

530
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:56,740
-What?
-Is this really happening?

531
00:23:56,775 --> 00:23:58,874
Oh, I know it's, uh --
it's not pretty,

532
00:23:58,909 --> 00:24:00,106
but we're improvising.

533
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:01,712
We're making it work.

534
00:24:01,747 --> 00:24:03,582
Fran, you maybe want
to stop macerating right now.

535
00:24:03,617 --> 00:24:06,552
I would like to introduce to you
a very special guest.

536
00:24:06,587 --> 00:24:08,917
He is our C.E.O.
and our founder...

537
00:24:08,952 --> 00:24:12,250
Oh, Jesus.
...and my dear,
dear friend.

538
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:13,955
Nick Martucci.

539
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:16,727
<i>Ciao, amici!</i>

540
00:24:16,762 --> 00:24:18,663
<i>-Ciao.</i>
-Whoo!

541
00:24:18,698 --> 00:24:19,994
Hey, don't stop on my account.

542
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:21,600
Oh, okay.

543
00:24:21,635 --> 00:24:23,261
I'm just, uh, whipping up
a little foam here.

544
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,570
More of an emulsion,
actually.

545
00:24:24,605 --> 00:24:26,132
I'm sure it'll be amazing.

546
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:27,837
Thank you.
Yeah.

547
00:24:27,872 --> 00:24:29,003
Well, I was in the neighborhood.
I figured I'd drop in.

548
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:31,610
Isn't this so cool?

549
00:24:31,645 --> 00:24:33,271
I mean, normally, I'm not here
in the off-season,

550
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:36,681
but I figured, for this group,
I'd make an exception.

551
00:24:37,651 --> 00:24:40,080
Oh, hey.
Hey, Nick.

552
00:24:40,115 --> 00:24:41,279
What's up?
I'm Susie.

553
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:42,621
Susie?
Mm-hmm.

554
00:24:42,656 --> 00:24:45,019
That's a beautiful name.
Alright.

555
00:24:47,221 --> 00:24:50,695
I'm Nick.
I'm -- I'm Jen.

556
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,224
Your name is Nick.

557
00:24:55,229 --> 00:24:56,261
Hi, Nick.

558
00:24:56,296 --> 00:24:58,263
You have exquisite hands.

559
00:24:58,298 --> 00:24:59,935
Thank you.

560
00:25:01,301 --> 00:25:03,873
Uh...

561
00:25:03,908 --> 00:25:06,271
I-I love you.

562
00:25:07,274 --> 00:25:08,647
Thank you.

563
00:25:11,685 --> 00:25:13,344
Oh, I'm sorry.

564
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:14,818
No, it's an honest mistake.

565
00:25:14,853 --> 00:25:15,885
I've never been
to Europe before.

566
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,623
No need to apologize.

567
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:23,926
She looks so much
like Connie, huh?

568
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:26,698
I'm Amber.

569
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:27,930
Well, it's nice
to meet you.

570
00:25:27,965 --> 00:25:29,998
Hey, Amber.
Hey.

571
00:25:30,033 --> 00:25:31,670
I'm, uh, Fran.

572
00:25:31,705 --> 00:25:34,200
Thank you all for coming
all the way over here.

573
00:25:34,235 --> 00:25:35,674
We're so appreciative
of everything

574
00:25:35,709 --> 00:25:37,236
that you've done for our family.

575
00:25:37,271 --> 00:25:39,040
Turns out, I'm gonna be around
a little bit this week,

576
00:25:39,075 --> 00:25:41,911
so I'm excited to get to know
you a little better.

577
00:25:41,946 --> 00:25:43,341
This is my assistant, Kat.

578
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:45,651
If you need anything,
feel free to approach her

579
00:25:45,686 --> 00:25:46,949
and let her know.

580
00:25:46,984 --> 00:25:48,621
She handles all my business.

581
00:25:48,656 --> 00:25:50,623
How about a group shot?

582
00:25:50,658 --> 00:25:51,723
Yeah, let's do it.

583
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,659
Come on.
-Yes.

584
00:25:53,694 --> 00:25:54,858
-Gnocchi.
-Gnocchi.

585
00:25:56,158 --> 00:25:59,027
Okay, everyone say "formaggi."

586
00:25:59,062 --> 00:26:01,194
-Formaggi.
-Formaggi.

587
00:26:01,229 --> 00:26:03,900
Mwah.<i> Bene.</i>

588
00:26:03,935 --> 00:26:05,968
Okay, now, if you'll excuse me,

589
00:26:06,003 --> 00:26:07,838
I'm gonna catch up
with you guys in the A.M.

590
00:26:07,873 --> 00:26:09,906
-Alright.
-Thank you, Nick.

591
00:26:09,941 --> 00:26:11,776
Bye.

592
00:26:11,811 --> 00:26:14,713
- Ooh, well...

593
00:26:14,748 --> 00:26:16,308
That was a lot, huh?

594
00:26:16,343 --> 00:26:18,145
Is everybody okay?

595
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,279
So, Nick.

596
00:26:20,314 --> 00:26:21,786
Boy, he was definitely

597
00:26:21,821 --> 00:26:23,117
feeling a little
something extra, hmm?

598
00:26:23,152 --> 00:26:25,988
-Well, I --
-Ah.

599
00:26:26,023 --> 00:26:28,254
- Oh.
Who's Connie?

600
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:29,420
I don't know.

601
00:26:29,455 --> 00:26:31,224
I kissed him
right on the lips.

602
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:32,390
You did.

603
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:34,029
Hey, you're Amber, right?
Yeah.

604
00:26:34,064 --> 00:26:37,230
Cool. Do you want
to take a smoke break?

605
00:26:37,265 --> 00:26:39,705
Oh, um --
Just come with me.

606
00:26:42,072 --> 00:26:43,401
Okay.

607
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:45,370
- Now, um, one of the things
that is --

608
00:26:45,405 --> 00:26:46,844
There you go.

609
00:26:46,879 --> 00:26:48,846
That I love about
the red pepper is that --

610
00:26:53,787 --> 00:26:55,952
Oh, I don't really smoke.

611
00:26:55,987 --> 00:26:58,020
Don't inhale, then.

612
00:26:58,055 --> 00:26:59,758
Okay.

613
00:27:08,395 --> 00:27:10,032
I t--
I only ever smoked

614
00:27:10,067 --> 00:27:12,199
for, like,
two weeks in high school,

615
00:27:12,234 --> 00:27:14,971
and I smoked cloves
'cause I thought it was so cool.

616
00:27:15,006 --> 00:27:16,808
And I would just, like,
drive around in my car

617
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,271
with my cigarette
hanging out the window

618
00:27:18,306 --> 00:27:20,174
but, like, so nauseous.

619
00:27:20,209 --> 00:27:22,044
And then, my mom found
the cigarettes in my purse

620
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,749
and, like, asked
if I was smoking.

621
00:27:23,784 --> 00:27:26,246
And I said no, and then I just,
like, burst into tears.

622
00:27:26,281 --> 00:27:28,446
I felt so bad about lying.

623
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:30,019
Just --
That's cool.

624
00:27:31,957 --> 00:27:34,727
Me crying is cool?

625
00:27:34,762 --> 00:27:36,421
No, sorry.

626
00:27:36,456 --> 00:27:38,863
I'm just kind of out of it
right now.

627
00:27:38,898 --> 00:27:40,161
Oh, from traveling.

628
00:27:40,196 --> 00:27:43,802
No. Nope, all we
fuckin' do is travel.

629
00:27:43,837 --> 00:27:45,771
Yeah, like, I can't even
remember the last time

630
00:27:45,806 --> 00:27:47,806
we were in one place
for more than a week.

631
00:27:47,841 --> 00:27:49,775
That sounds fun.

632
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:50,941
Yeah, it can be.

633
00:27:50,976 --> 00:27:54,879
It can also suck --
majorly.

634
00:27:56,949 --> 00:27:58,949
I'm sorry, I'm, like,
dumping all my shit on you,

635
00:27:58,984 --> 00:28:00,148
and we just met.

636
00:28:00,183 --> 00:28:03,118
Oh, my God,
you can dump shit on me.

637
00:28:03,153 --> 00:28:04,823
Yeah?

638
00:28:09,489 --> 00:28:11,126
What are you doing
tonight?

639
00:28:11,161 --> 00:28:12,930
Do you have plans?

640
00:28:12,965 --> 00:28:14,426
No.
I mean, I don't know.

641
00:28:14,461 --> 00:28:16,835
I don't think we're allowed to,
like, plan our own stuff.

642
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:19,970
No, fuck that.
You're with me.

643
00:28:20,005 --> 00:28:22,808
I actually know this really
cool spot in Lucca.

644
00:28:22,843 --> 00:28:24,040
Okay, great.

645
00:28:24,075 --> 00:28:27,043
I wanna go to a cool spot
in Lucca.

646
00:28:27,078 --> 00:28:29,342
Plus, Craig says we should
all stick together, right?

647
00:28:31,214 --> 00:28:33,984
Can I bum a square?

648
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:35,183
- Here we go --
first one.

649
00:28:35,218 --> 00:28:36,789
Okay.
There we go.

650
00:28:36,824 --> 00:28:38,516
Uh...

651
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:39,858
Marjoram?

652
00:28:39,893 --> 00:28:41,519
No.

653
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:43,059
Mint?

654
00:28:43,094 --> 00:28:45,193
No.

655
00:28:45,228 --> 00:28:47,360
Pine?
Mm, no.

656
00:28:47,395 --> 00:28:50,165
Hey, everybody.

657
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,103
Amber, Kat, and I are gonna go
to a really cool bar in Lucca

658
00:28:54,138 --> 00:28:56,006
tonight if anybody wants
to come with us.

659
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:58,877
Okay, no.
That's not gonna happen.

660
00:28:58,912 --> 00:29:01,473
So, to be crystal clear,
none of us are going to leave

661
00:29:01,508 --> 00:29:05,081
the TG campus except the --
Oh, Craig, it'll be fun!

662
00:29:05,116 --> 00:29:07,578
You gotta live
a little, baby.

663
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:09,888
-I'm trying to go.
-Uh, no.

664
00:29:09,923 --> 00:29:11,516
It's the birth place
of Puccini.

665
00:29:11,551 --> 00:29:14,123
Deb.
Deb, that's not permitted.

666
00:29:14,158 --> 00:29:15,553
What's not permitted?

667
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:16,829
Smoking.

668
00:29:16,864 --> 00:29:19,326
What?

669
00:29:19,361 --> 00:29:22,131
Deb?
Put it out.

670
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:24,265
Oh, my God, so serious.

671
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,136
Craig, we're in Europe,
if you didn't know,

672
00:29:27,171 --> 00:29:31,107
and you need to lighten up
a little bit, please.

673
00:29:31,142 --> 00:29:33,175
This is a working kitchen.

674
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,573
Put it out.

675
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:37,311
Fine.

676
00:29:41,383 --> 00:29:43,548
-Cool, so, Lucca?
-Yeah, can we go?

677
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:46,287
Alright, guys,
I'll make you a deal.

678
00:29:46,322 --> 00:29:47,585
We can go...
-Yes!

679
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,191
-Yes!
-Let's go.

680
00:29:49,226 --> 00:29:50,995
...to the bar right here.
What the fuck, Craig?

681
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,931
What kind of deal
is that, Craig?

682
00:29:52,966 --> 00:29:54,966
I don't know what to tell you.
We're not going to Lucca.

683
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,330
Them's the rules, alright?

684
00:29:56,365 --> 00:29:57,903
I brought some molly,

685
00:29:57,938 --> 00:29:59,003
and Jen and I
are gonna roll tonight.

686
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:00,400
I don't know
if you wanna...

687
00:30:00,435 --> 00:30:01,500
We'll just see.
Okay.

688
00:30:01,535 --> 00:30:03,007
Yeah, no pressure.

689
00:30:03,042 --> 00:30:05,537
What are you guys
talking about?

690
00:30:09,983 --> 00:30:11,884
Oh, my God, look at them.

691
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,446
...my eyes.

692
00:30:13,481 --> 00:30:16,548
We have the same face!

693
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:20,321
Ugh, they are
so annoying.

694
00:30:20,356 --> 00:30:22,026
It's so depressing.

695
00:30:22,061 --> 00:30:23,522
When I first got to Italy,

696
00:30:23,557 --> 00:30:25,359
I had men that were, like,
chasing me down the streets.

697
00:30:25,394 --> 00:30:27,295
You know, th-they would --
they would cat-call me.

698
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,560
They -- They would just,
like, reach out

699
00:30:28,595 --> 00:30:30,529
and take big ol' handfuls
of my ass.

700

No, it was great.

What's your all-time
favorite place?

721
00:31:17,644 --> 00:31:19,479
Mm...

722
00:31:19,514 --> 00:31:23,252
been so many places.

723
00:31:23,287 --> 00:31:25,991
Oh, this one time, I was living
abroad in the Andes,

724
00:31:26,026 --> 00:31:29,225
and I hiked up the cape
to Pachamama high on coca.

725
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,721
Coca?

726
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:33,163
Yeah, you need the coca
to survive the<i> soroche.</i>

727
00:31:33,198 --> 00:31:34,725
What's that?
Altitude sickness.

728
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,166
We were at 3,200 meters,

729
00:31:36,201 --> 00:31:38,036
so you definitely
need the coca.

730
00:31:38,071 --> 00:31:39,499
Anyway, it was
the solstice, right?

731
00:31:39,534 --> 00:31:41,501
So it was like the one day
out of the entire year

732
00:31:41,536 --> 00:31:43,371
where the sunlight hits both
of the ovary rooms

733

734

Latin American kick.

00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:54,316
Mnh-mnh.
Don't think so.

738
00:31:54,351 --> 00:31:56,351
Well, I've been reading
"News of a Kidnapping."

739

all these people

by Pablo Escobar.

Yeah.

746
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:13,401
It's wild how much better
the food is here, right?

747
00:32:13,436 --> 00:32:16,008
Fran, this olive,
these chips --

748

an olive before.

00:38:25,005 --> 00:38:27,643
a few months ago.

878
00:38:27,678 --> 00:38:30,140
He was really controlling
and, like --

879
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:31,614
I don't know,
he just made me feel,

880
00:38:31,649 --> 00:38:33,781
like, really bad
about myself a lot.

881
00:38:33,816 --> 00:38:35,915
Um, and I don't think
I was great for him, either.

882
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,422
I was, like, always trying to
break up with him,

883
00:38:37,457 --> 00:38:38,720
and he was constantly,
like,

884
00:38:38,755 --> 00:38:41,591
talking me back
into the relationship.

885
00:38:41,626 --> 00:38:43,395
It just made me feel like
love is supposed to be

886
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,792
really hard work

887
00:38:44,827 --> 00:38:46,728
and, like, that no one
would ever love me

888
00:38:46,763 --> 00:38:48,499
without makeup on, and...

889
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,405
Wow,
that's really horrible.

890
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,934
You didn't deserve that.

891
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:00,742
Yeah, so, I guess I'm just --
I'm kind of glad

892
00:39:00,777 --> 00:39:03,140
not to have love
in my life right now, you know?

893
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:09,047
I get to just be myself
and have fun.

894
00:39:09,082 --> 00:39:10,884

nobody else?

I've kind of just
shut it down.

898
00:39:18,465 --> 00:39:21,697

I am a little guarded.

1230
00:55:54,823 --> 00:55:57,791
<i>Eh, voilà.</i>

1231
00:55:57,826 --> 00:55:59,496
Wow, this looks
incredible.

1232
00:55:59,531 --> 00:56:00,728
There you go.
Told you.

Oh, my God.

1234
00:56:07,539 --> 00:56:09,033
Mm-hmm.
It's so good.

1235

I know.

1236
00:56:10,542 --> 00:56:12,674
Just hurry up and eat
before he gets back.

1237
00:56:12,709 --> 00:56:14,511
Why?

1238
00:56:14,546 --> 00:56:16,843
You don't want to have
to pay for this.

1239
00:56:16,878 --> 00:56:19,175
I thought it was free.
Don't you know that guy?

1240
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:21,584
Yeah,
he's a fucking scumbag.

1241
00:56:21,619 --> 00:56:23,685
Just eat.
Come on, let's go.

1242
00:56:24,985 --> 00:56:26,523

Nick's a fucking baby.

She's sick.
Chill, okay?

1351
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:17,389

1352
01:04:17,424 --> 01:04:18,995
- Morning.

1353
01:04:19,030 --> 01:04:20,931
So, we're gonna watch
a video today --

1354
01:04:20,966 --> 01:04:22,394
"Life is Beautiful."

1355
01:04:22,429 --> 01:04:24,033
You couldn't find that
on laser disc, there, Craig?

1356
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:26,068
It stars Roberto Benini.

1357
01:04:26,103 --> 01:04:27,971
Anyone seen it?
I have, Craig.

1358
01:04:28,006 --> 01:04:31,106
Okay, yeah, I haven't seen it,
either, but it got some Oscars.

1359
01:04:31,141 --> 01:04:32,437
It's supposed to be a banger.

1360
01:04:32,472 --> 01:04:35,143
Craig,
I feel really sick.

1361
01:04:35,178 --> 01:04:37,409
I just f--
I don't feel good.

1362
01:04:37,444 --> 01:04:40,181
Oh, no.
You need to excuse yourself?

1363
01:04:40,216 --> 01:04:42,348
Uh, yeah, I'm sorry.
Is that okay?

1364
01:04:42,383 --> 01:04:44,680
I mean, I don't want you
to miss out.

1365
01:04:44,715 --> 01:04:46,550
This is supposed
to be hysterical.

1366
01:04:46,585 --> 01:04:49,685
I just think I need to,
like, rest, you know?

1367
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,390
Are they telling you
to say this?

1368
01:04:51,425 --> 01:04:53,029
Just fucking drop it.

1369
01:04:53,064 --> 01:04:55,559
I gotcha.
Feel better, Jen.

1370
01:04:55,594 --> 01:04:57,561
Okay.
Bye, guys.

1371
01:04:57,596 --> 01:04:59,299
I'll miss you guys.

1372
01:04:59,334 --> 01:05:02,104
Ugh, don't worry about me.
I'm okay.

1373
01:05:02,139 --> 01:05:04,139
- Boy, they're really
dropping like flies, huh?

1374
01:05:04,174 --> 01:05:05,536
Hey, maybe we should go
whip up

1375
01:05:05,571 --> 01:05:07,274
some wellness shots
or something, you know?

1376
01:05:07,309 --> 01:05:10,013
Like, in the kitchen?
Like, make something, Craig?

1377
01:05:10,048 --> 01:05:11,410
Can I talk to you
outside for a second?

1378
01:05:11,445 --> 01:05:13,379
Showing a movie
to kill some time?

1379
01:05:13,414 --> 01:05:14,985
Okay.

1380
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:16,415
This is some substitute
teacher bullshit, Craig.

1381
01:05:19,288 --> 01:05:21,255
Here.
Oh, I-I don't really smoke.

1382
01:05:21,290 --> 01:05:22,487
It was subterfuge.

1383
01:05:22,522 --> 01:05:24,126
Just don't inhale.

1384
01:05:24,161 --> 01:05:26,260
Okay, um...

1385
01:05:26,295 --> 01:05:28,493
Listen...

1386
01:05:28,528 --> 01:05:31,463
I think something weird
might be going on.

1387
01:05:31,498 --> 01:05:33,168
What do you mean?

1388
01:05:33,203 --> 01:05:35,533
Well, don't you think
it's weird that Liz Bence

1389
01:05:35,568 --> 01:05:38,602
suddenly disappeared
with no explanation?

1390
01:05:38,637 --> 01:05:40,703
I guess.
Is it weird?

1391
01:05:40,738 --> 01:05:43,079
And then, like, we haven't
seen Susie in two days.

1392
01:05:43,114 --> 01:05:46,478
And, like, Jen is suddenly
acting so strange,

1393
01:05:46,513 --> 01:05:48,084
and she's not feeling well.

1394
01:05:48,119 --> 01:05:50,218
Like, you had a bad migraine
for two days,

1395
01:05:50,253 --> 01:05:51,582
and I looked it up,
'cause I was worried.

1396
01:05:51,617 --> 01:05:53,452
And --
And I found, normally,

1397
01:05:53,487 --> 01:05:55,157
they only last
for four hours.

1398
01:05:55,192 --> 01:05:56,719
Why are all the women
in this program

1399
01:05:56,754 --> 01:05:58,259
suddenly getting sick?

1400
01:05:58,294 --> 01:06:01,097
I mean, have you talked
to Deb recently?

1401
01:06:01,132 --> 01:06:03,627
Something is definitely
going on with her.

1402
01:06:03,662 --> 01:06:07,136
So, maybe
it wasn't a migraine.

1403
01:06:07,171 --> 01:06:08,500
Maybe it was
something else.

1404
01:06:08,535 --> 01:06:09,798
Like what?

1405
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:11,239
Poison.

1406
01:06:11,274 --> 01:06:13,406
Poison?
Think about it.

1407
01:06:13,441 --> 01:06:14,737
Liz Bence was making
all our food, right?

1408
01:06:14,772 --> 01:06:16,739
Mm-hmm.
Then, she disappears.

1409
01:06:16,774 --> 01:06:18,774
All of a sudden,
all of the women in the program

1410
01:06:18,809 --> 01:06:20,512
are dropping like flies.

1411
01:06:20,547 --> 01:06:22,613
Okay, I didn't actually
have a migraine.

1412
01:06:22,648 --> 01:06:23,647
That was just something
I said to cover

1413
01:06:23,682 --> 01:06:25,055
what was really going on.

1414
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:28,685
Okay, well, what was
really going on?

1415
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,093
Remember Kat?

1416
01:06:30,128 --> 01:06:31,556
Nick's assistant?
Of course.

1417
01:06:31,591 --> 01:06:34,361
Well, she secretly took me
to Nick's boat.

1418
01:06:34,396 --> 01:06:35,659
What?
Yeah.

1419
01:06:35,694 --> 01:06:37,100
She, like, made up
this whole scenario

1420
01:06:37,135 --> 01:06:38,365
so I could spend
the day with Nick,

1421
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,828
and we went out
on his huge yacht.

1422
01:06:39,863 --> 01:06:41,665
And, like, then she drove me
back here afterwards,

1423
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:43,403
and they both told me
not to tell anybody.

1424
01:06:43,438 --> 01:06:46,274
But, like,
Kat is kinda sketchy.

1425
01:06:46,309 --> 01:06:48,408
Like, she and Nick have
a super volatile relationship.

1426
01:06:48,443 --> 01:06:50,410
Like,
she kind of hates him.

1427
01:06:50,445 --> 01:06:53,380
You spent the day on Nick's
yacht, just the two of you?

1428
01:06:53,415 --> 01:06:54,810
Y-Yeah, and --
and what I'm saying is...

1429
01:06:54,845 --> 01:06:57,516
Wow. Yeah.
...Kat...

1430
01:06:57,551 --> 01:06:59,287
Yeah, yeah, that's fun.

1431
01:06:59,322 --> 01:07:00,453
A boat day, that's cool.

1432
01:07:00,488 --> 01:07:01,850
Okay, Dana?
Listen to me.

1433
01:07:01,885 --> 01:07:04,688
What I'm trying to say is
that Kat is kind of shady.

1434
01:07:04,723 --> 01:07:07,163
The next time I saw Nick --
Wait, you saw Nick again?

1435
01:07:07,198 --> 01:07:08,824
Yes, and she was supposed
to bring me right back here

1436
01:07:08,859 --> 01:07:10,232
afterward, and instead,
she took me to Lucca.

1437
01:07:10,267 --> 01:07:11,662
Birthplace of Puccini.

1438
01:07:11,697 --> 01:07:13,433
And then, just yesterday,
I saw her taking Susie away.

1439
01:07:13,468 --> 01:07:15,468
And she got back last night,
and Susie was gone.

1440
01:07:15,503 --> 01:07:17,272
And she left me some book
about kidnapping.

1441
01:07:17,307 --> 01:07:19,175
I'm just saying, if something
sketchy is going on here,

1442
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:21,144
maybe Kat has something
to do with it.

1443
01:07:27,284 --> 01:07:28,745
Hey, uh, Craig.

1444
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:32,452
I, uh -- I have to go
to the bathroom so bad.

1445
01:07:32,487 --> 01:07:34,586
Uh, is it okay if I go
to the bathroom?

1446
01:07:34,621 --> 01:07:35,884
'Cause I gotta go so bad.

1447
01:07:35,919 --> 01:07:37,523
Yeah.

01:08:50,235 --> 01:08:51,696
Okay, yeah.
No, that's --

1467
01:08:51,731 --> 01:08:54,534
But now, it makes so much sense
why she was so upset

1468
01:08:54,569 --> 01:08:55,931
with Nick
this whole time.

1469
01:08:55,966 --> 01:08:58,736
Like -- Like, she was jealous
of him and me.

1470
01:08:58,771 --> 01:09:01,673
Maybe we -- we were ruining
her whole plan.

1471
01:09:01,708 --> 01:09:02,971
But jealous about what?

1472
01:09:03,006 --> 01:09:04,412
Him and I making
out and stuff.

1473
01:09:04,447 --> 01:09:05,644
She saw it when
she picked me up.

1474
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:07,679
Wait, you made out
with Nick, too?

1475
01:09:07,714 --> 01:09:11,386
Y-- Why are our trips
so different?

1476
01:09:11,421 --> 01:09:12,915
Wait a second.

1477
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:16,424
I just thought
of something.

1478
01:09:16,459 --> 01:09:19,922
Fran and I both have
unisex names.

1479
01:09:19,957 --> 01:09:22,562
They thought
we were women, too.

1480
01:09:22,597 --> 01:09:25,565
And that is why Nick
was so weird

1481
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,534
when we first met,
right?

1482
01:09:27,569 --> 01:09:29,338
It's not just Kat --
it's Nick, too.

1483
01:09:29,373 --> 01:09:30,537
No, no, no, no, no.

1484
01:09:30,572 --> 01:09:32,341
I-I don't think it is Nick.

1485
01:09:32,376 --> 01:09:34,904
Like, I haven't even seen Nick
with any other women --

1486
01:09:34,939 --> 01:09:36,279
only Kat.

1487
01:09:36,314 --> 01:09:37,643
And Kat, she's been, like,

1488
01:09:37,678 --> 01:09:39,711
steering me to suspect him
this whole time.

1489
01:09:39,746 --> 01:09:41,548
Right.
Kat's the poisoner.

1490
01:09:41,583 --> 01:09:43,253
No, I don't think
there's poison.

01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:03,876
Like, the other day
on the boat,

1579
01:14:03,911 --> 01:14:06,109
he was asking me all these
intimate questions, and --

1580
01:14:06,144 --> 01:14:09,783
and I told him some --
some really private stuff.

1581
01:14:09,818 --> 01:14:11,818
I'm such a fucking idiot.

1582
01:14:11,853 --> 01:14:13,721
Whoa.
Like, what private stuff?

1583
01:14:13,756 --> 01:14:14,953
It's private.

1584
01:14:14,988 --> 01:14:16,559
Sorry.

1585
01:14:16,594 --> 01:14:17,791
But, like,
it was really weird,

1586
01:14:17,826 --> 01:14:19,155
because it started out
super simply.

1587
01:14:19,190 --> 01:14:20,596
Like, "If you could be famous,
would you?"

1588
01:14:20,631 --> 01:14:22,158
But then, he got into shit
about, like,

1589
01:14:22,193 --> 01:14:23,291
"What roles do love and
affection play in your life?"

1590
01:14:23,326 --> 01:14:24,732
Like, who even talks
like that?

1591
01:14:24,767 --> 01:14:27,570
When did you last sing
to yourself?

1592
01:14:27,605 --> 01:14:28,670
Last week, why?

1593
01:14:31,169 --> 01:14:33,070
Look.

1594
01:14:33,105 --> 01:14:36,546
"'The New York Times' 36
Questions that Lead to Love."

1595
01:14:38,682 --> 01:14:39,846
Oh, my God.

1596
01:14:39,881 --> 01:14:41,980
Nick is the mastermind.

1597
01:14:42,015 --> 01:14:43,586
Okay, we gotta get the fuck
out of here.

1598
01:14:43,621 --> 01:14:46,655
Right. Well,
Craig has our passports.

1599
01:14:57,063 --> 01:14:58,997
We're American citizens,
and so we have a right

1600
01:14:59,032 --> 01:15:02,066
to demand
our passports back now.

1601
01:15:02,101 --> 01:15:04,574
And so,
we do demand that.

1602
01:15:04,609 --> 01:15:07,236
Furthermore, we want
to be flown out of here --

1603
01:15:07,271 --> 01:15:09,106
t-tonight, now.

1604
01:15:09,141 --> 01:15:13,682
Uh, well, yeah, that's --
that's not gonna happen.

1605
01:15:13,717 --> 01:15:15,618
Look, we know there's
something shady going on,

1606
01:15:15,653 --> 01:15:17,620
and we just want
to leave quietly.

1607
01:15:17,655 --> 01:15:20,590
So, just give us our passports,
and we won't report

1608
01:15:20,625 --> 01:15:22,658
any of this --
Wait, what?

1609
01:15:22,693 --> 01:15:23,923
What's that, now?

1610
01:15:23,958 --> 01:15:26,893
All these "women"
getting "sick"...

1611
01:15:26,928 --> 01:15:28,763
What are these
air quotes about?

1612
01:15:28,798 --> 01:15:29,896
I'm not following.

1613
01:15:29,931 --> 01:15:31,865
Where's Liz?
Where's Susie, huh?

1614
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:34,065
We know they're not
just getting "sick," Craig.

1615
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:36,771
So, Lizzie was only scheduled
to be here two days,

1616
01:15:36,806 --> 01:15:38,168
and she's left.

1617
01:15:38,203 --> 01:15:40,676
Well,
what about my migraine?

1618
01:15:40,711 --> 01:15:41,809
I didn't even have one.

1619
01:15:41,844 --> 01:15:43,811
Oh, you didn't?

1620
01:15:43,846 --> 01:15:44,944
Huh.

1621
01:15:44,979 --> 01:15:46,946
Why did you say you did?

1622
01:15:46,981 --> 01:15:50,851
Listen, guys,
tomorrow's the last day.

1623
01:15:50,886 --> 01:15:53,084
It's probably best
not to rock the boat.

1624
01:15:57,321 --> 01:15:59,123
I have a woman's name.

1625
01:16:02,029 --> 01:16:08,363
♪♪

1626
01:16:08,398 --> 01:16:15,370
♪♪

1627
01:16:15,405 --> 01:16:18,109
So, I need to apologize
once again

1628
01:16:18,144 --> 01:16:19,847
for showing "Life is Beautiful."

1629
01:16:19,882 --> 01:16:21,783
Uh, my bad.

1630
01:16:21,818 --> 01:16:24,984
I'll be reading the synopses
from here on out.

1631
01:16:25,019 --> 01:16:29,054
I'd also like to, uh,
remind everyone that

1632
01:16:29,089 --> 01:16:31,958
you're very lucky to be here,
and you should be

1633
01:16:31,993 --> 01:16:34,862
very appreciative
of this opportunity.

1634
01:16:34,897 --> 01:16:39,031
So, keep it professional
and positive, okay?

1635
01:16:39,066 --> 01:16:40,703
So, in that spirit, let's do

1636
01:16:40,738 --> 01:16:42,870
some trust-building
exercises today.

1637
01:16:42,905 --> 01:16:44,938
This one's called
"Pass the Zuke."

1638
01:16:44,973 --> 01:16:48,106
Uh, share something personal
about yourselves, uh,

1639
01:16:48,141 --> 01:16:50,845
perhaps something you learned
on this trip. I'll start.

1640
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,880
Um, I got
a better idea, Craig.

1641
01:16:52,915 --> 01:16:54,849
We should play Mafia.

1642
01:16:54,884 --> 01:16:58,688
It's really fun and it's
a great way to build trust.

1643
01:16:58,723 --> 01:17:00,690
Alright, so, I'm gonna hand
out these little cards.

1644
01:17:00,725 --> 01:17:02,417
They're gonna tell you
if you are a villager

1645
01:17:02,452 --> 01:17:05,156
or a member of the Mafia.

1646
01:17:05,191 --> 01:17:06,795
And then we're all
gonna close our eyes.

1647
01:17:06,830 --> 01:17:09,864
Mafia members will open them,
make eye contact,

1648
01:17:09,899 --> 01:17:12,064
and carefully choose
someone to kill.

1649
01:17:12,099 --> 01:17:13,296
- Hey, Nick.

1650
01:17:13,331 --> 01:17:16,431
-Hey, Nick.
<i>-Ciao, amici.</i>

1651
01:17:16,466 --> 01:17:19,170
Amber, could we have
a word outside, please?

1652
01:17:19,205 --> 01:17:22,173
I'm good.
She's good.

1653
01:17:22,208 --> 01:17:24,780
Hey, uh,
you want to play, Nick?

1654
01:17:24,815 --> 01:17:26,947
Uh, okay.

1655
01:17:26,982 --> 01:17:29,312
Sure.
What's the game?

1656
01:17:29,347 --> 01:17:32,183
Mafia.
Great.

1657
01:17:32,218 --> 01:17:33,855
-Awesome.
-Unreal.

1658
01:17:33,890 --> 01:17:36,792
Okay.
Shuffle these boys up.

1659
01:17:36,827 --> 01:17:38,860
Keep those close
to the vest.

1660
01:17:38,895 --> 01:17:40,323
Don't let anyone know
who you are.

1661
01:17:40,358 --> 01:17:42,259
Do you understand
the game, Deb?

1662
01:17:42,294 --> 01:17:45,262
- Yes. I think I do.
Here you go, my don.

1663
01:17:47,299 --> 01:17:49,904
Okay, everybody.
It's morningtime.

1664
01:17:49,939 --> 01:17:52,434
The sun is rising.
The birds are chirping.

1665
01:17:52,469 --> 01:17:54,810
You just had a restful sleep.

1666
01:17:54,845 --> 01:17:58,044
And in a second, everyone's
gonna open their eyes,

1667
01:17:58,079 --> 01:18:01,311
except for Dana.

1668
01:18:01,346 --> 01:18:03,049
Dana, you're dead, bro.

1669
01:18:03,084 --> 01:18:04,116
Okay.

1670
01:18:04,151 --> 01:18:06,217
Well, obviously,
it was Nick.

1671
01:18:06,252 --> 01:18:09,924
Right?
What'd you do with them?

1672
01:18:09,959 --> 01:18:11,486
Who?
Wait. Dana, you're not
allowed to talk.

1673
01:18:11,521 --> 01:18:12,927
You're dead.

1674
01:18:12,962 --> 01:18:14,159
Why would you think
that I did it?

1675
01:18:14,194 --> 01:18:15,864
Well, because
you know I know.

1676
01:18:15,899 --> 01:18:17,932
I mean, it's so obvious.

1677
01:18:17,967 --> 01:18:19,868
Know what, Dana?

1678
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:22,233
Dana,
zip it up, dude, okay?

1679
01:18:22,268 --> 01:18:24,400
Were you Mafia
or were you a villager?

1680
01:18:24,435 --> 01:18:26,974
Yeah, maybe play it cool.
No, no.

1681
01:18:27,009 --> 01:18:29,108
He makes himself out to be
this amazing guy, right?

1682
01:18:29,143 --> 01:18:31,946
Mm-hmm.
With this amazing family.

1683
01:18:31,981 --> 01:18:33,376
And that
bringing all of us here

1684
01:18:33,411 --> 01:18:35,114
will let us be
a part of that.

1685
01:18:35,149 --> 01:18:37,215
And, instead,
he just totally snubs me,

1686
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:40,889
and this program sucks!

1687
01:18:40,924 --> 01:18:43,089
It sucks.
I'm sorry.

1688
01:18:43,124 --> 01:18:45,058
You just fly a bunch
of white people out here.

1689
01:18:45,093 --> 01:18:46,554
You make a Bolognese.

1690
01:18:46,589 --> 01:18:50,195
You watch moves in this
dilapidated, low-rent shithole.

1691
01:18:50,230 --> 01:18:51,999
You have no other plan.

1692
01:18:52,034 --> 01:18:55,266
I hear trains go by
every fucking three seconds.

1693
01:18:55,301 --> 01:18:58,434
My room has silverfish in it,
and they really scare me,

1694
01:18:58,469 --> 01:18:59,974
but I don't want
to kill them,

1695
01:19:00,009 --> 01:19:02,273
so I'm just living
with fucking silverfish?!

1696
01:19:02,308 --> 01:19:03,879
Fuck this!

1697
01:19:03,914 --> 01:19:05,210
I'm Persian.

1698
01:19:05,245 --> 01:19:06,508
Okay.
I'm sorry.

1699
01:19:06,543 --> 01:19:08,444
But where is everyone
disappearing to?

1700
01:19:08,479 --> 01:19:10,380
Nick,
are you poisoning them?

1701
01:19:10,415 --> 01:19:13,152
-Whoa! Stop it.
-You're being a dick, Dana.

1702
01:19:13,187 --> 01:19:15,385
No, no, no.
It's okay.

1703
01:19:17,455 --> 01:19:19,224
You want to talk
about family?

1704
01:19:21,228 --> 01:19:23,129
You ever held your sister's hand
as she died

1705
01:19:23,164 --> 01:19:24,460
right in front of you?
No, I haven't.

1706
01:19:24,495 --> 01:19:26,297
That would be
an incredible coincidence.

1707
01:19:26,332 --> 01:19:27,496
I have.

1708
01:19:27,531 --> 01:19:30,499
Connie --

1709
01:19:33,438 --> 01:19:36,472
Connie was my everything.

1710
01:19:36,507 --> 01:19:39,046
I mean, this isn't
what I signed up for.

1711
01:19:39,081 --> 01:19:42,445
Tuscan Grove was supposed to be
a fine-dining experience,

1712
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,414
so I didn't know
it was gonna snowball

1713
01:19:44,449 --> 01:19:46,614
into some fucking populist,
mass-produced,

1714
01:19:46,649 --> 01:19:49,023
fucking fast-food bullshit.

1715
01:19:49,058 --> 01:19:52,323
It was supposed
to be my Spago,

1716
01:19:52,358 --> 01:19:54,589
my Chez Panisse.

1717
01:19:54,624 --> 01:19:56,294
I've accepted what
it's become --

1718
01:19:56,329 --> 01:19:58,098
a massive success.
Great.

1719
01:19:58,133 --> 01:20:02,971
And now I try and create
a beautiful experience

1720
01:20:03,006 --> 01:20:06,007
for all of you,
inviting...

1721
01:20:06,042 --> 01:20:08,504
you into my home...

1722
01:20:10,145 --> 01:20:13,949
...my villa, my...
my life.

1723
01:20:13,984 --> 01:20:16,985
And you have the nerve
to accuse me?

1724
01:20:20,551 --> 01:20:24,553
I-I really put my heart
on the line this time.

1725
01:20:26,326 --> 01:20:28,964
Never again.

1726
01:20:47,182 --> 01:20:49,248
It hurt -- it hurts.

1727
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,456
I'm sorry.

1728
01:21:03,429 --> 01:21:07,299
Thank you for inviting me
into your little game.

1729
01:21:07,334 --> 01:21:08,630
But I should go.

1730
01:21:08,665 --> 01:21:10,599
-No. No. No, no, no.
-Nick, come on, man.

1731
01:21:10,634 --> 01:21:13,206
Nico.

1732
01:21:15,012 --> 01:21:16,374
Way to go, Dana,
you pussy.

1733
01:21:16,409 --> 01:21:18,277
Hey, fuck you, Fran.
You're a fraud.

1734
01:21:18,312 --> 01:21:19,575
What'd you say?
You're a fraud.

1735
01:21:19,610 --> 01:21:21,478
I saw your episode
of "Chef's Challenge,"

1736
01:21:21,513 --> 01:21:23,150
and a fucking tween
beat you.

1737
01:21:23,185 --> 01:21:24,613
A twe-- a tween?!

1738
01:21:24,648 --> 01:21:27,451
Elliot is 13 1/2 years old.
That's not a tween.

1739
01:21:27,486 --> 01:21:29,420
And, furthermore, the rules
are fucking bullshit.

1740
01:21:29,455 --> 01:21:31,092
Think about it.
You know what?

1741
01:21:31,127 --> 01:21:32,390
They edited it to make me
look like an asshole.

1742
01:21:32,425 --> 01:21:33,490
You weren't even there.
Fuck you.

1743
01:21:33,525 --> 01:21:35,096
- Enough!

1744
01:21:35,131 --> 01:21:36,328
This is supposed to be
a team-building exercise.

1745
01:21:36,363 --> 01:21:37,560
Dana, cool out.

1746
01:21:37,595 --> 01:21:40,695
Ooh! Ooh! Fooh!

1747
01:21:40,730 --> 01:21:43,038
