158
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,444
Yeah. I'm almost done
with my applications, too.

159
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:09,239
Just need to find a pen, paper.

160
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:13,410
So I guess the comedy train
is rolling to a halt.

161
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,413
I'm gonna miss this place.

162
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,415
-Hmm.
-Yeah.

[Doug]
<i>I said I just need to find a pen, Mom.</i>

164
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:24,421
Doug, this is serious.
You didn't apply anywhere?

165
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,880
For the love of Christ.

166
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,842
-I've been busy. I did write a book.
-Most of a book.

167
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,845
Well, Henry helped... with the spelling.
Uh, did you like it?

168
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:35,473
-She didn't read it.
-The book? Yes, it's very nice.

169
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,142
Um...

170
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,061
Interesting cover.

171
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,187
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

172
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,772
-Loves the cover.
-How is Henry?

173
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,941
-He's going to law school, that's how.
<i>-Henry's okay.</i>

174
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:48,278
We were supposed to hang out today,
but he got arrested. Arson again.

175
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,195
It's the gentleman's crime.

-He didn't read it.

181
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,247
It's very nice. Listen.

<i>You got a month till graduation,</i>
<i>and we're still waiting to hear.</i>

183
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,543
Do you have any kind of plan? [chuckles]

184
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,337
I mean, we spent a lot of money
to get what? An English degree?

185
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:07,839
Harvard education
and you throw it all away.

186

<i>-What's your plan, Doug?</i>

<i>to wait to get picked in the draft?</i>

189
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,807
Or do you want to graduate Harvard
and then move back home,

190
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,267
teach tennis with me at the club?

191
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,228
If I teach, do I have to wear shorts?
'Cause that's a deal-breaker.

<i>What do you want?</i>

-<i>Hello, Doug?</i>

<i>-What?</i>
-What?

196
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,073
If you think I'm gonna pay
for another year of college--

197
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,325
No, no, no.
I'm gonna start a real magazine.

198
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,160
A national one, with Henry.

199

-I'm not doing that.
-I don't have all the details,

200

about his backhand.

for some half-assed scheme?

206

Oh, this scheme is full-assed.
Why settle for real jobs?

207
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,517
You know, just wind up
behind a desk somewhere?

208
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,227
You know, a magazine needs desks.

209
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,564
The world doesn't need more lawyers
or insurance executives or doctors.

210
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:11,152
I mean, yeah, okay, it needs doctors.
Thousands. But it also needs us.

[Henry]
A magazine's a tough business, Doug.

214
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,578
You want to be a writer,
write a novel on the side,

something your parents can show off
on their credenza.

216

No, you have things
you think you're supposed to do.

222
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,764
What you want to do
is keep on doing<i> The Lampoon.</i>

-Oh,<i> Biomechanics of the Human Bladder.</i>
<i>-</i> Thanks.

224
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,434
I've been looking everywhere for that.

225
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,814
You want me to give up a career
in law to rely on you

226
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,775
and start a humor magazine
which will undoubtedly fail.

227
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,570
It won't. Or it might. It might.

228
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,823
-But this will be big. I can feel it.
-How big?

229
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:57,949
This big.

230
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,743
You're thinking too small.
It should be a big magazine size.

231
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,746
See? That's better.
I threw something out, you made it better.

232
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,374
That's our partnership.
You don't want to throw that away.

233
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,878
If we're running our own magazine,
we can do anything we want.

234
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,172
-We could publish knock-knock jokes.
-Knock knock.

-Who's there?
-Me.

00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,757
-Me who?
-Me not doing the magazine.

237
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,719
-That can go in issue one.
-Let me ask you this:

238
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,680
with<i> The Harvard Lampoon,</i>
how many deadlines have we missed?

239
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,181
-None.
-All of them.

240
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,933
-All of them?
-We've never made a deadline.

241
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,852
You really don't think you can rely on me?

242
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,437
-No.
-I challenge you,

243
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,188
name a thousand times I let you down.

244
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,983
-Number one--
-Okay, that's not the point.

245
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:35,153
Look, I know it's risky, okay,
but why let it end here?

246
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:38,323
The truth is
I can't do this without you, man.

247
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,159
-Half the time I feel like a fraud.
-And the other half?

248
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:44,037
The other half, I feel like
the second-smartest guy in the room.

00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,414
I'm the smartest?

Yeah.

00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,543
I promise you, it'll be fun.

252

And the day that it stops being fun,

00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,534
<i>National Lampoon.</i>

263
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,620
We would license the<i> Lampoon</i> name
from Harvard.

264
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,581
As we say in the proposal,
there is a huge underserved audience

for comedy that speaks to our generation.

266

Oh, and you think that's what
this country needs is a comedy magazine.

There's a vast gap between<i> Mad</i> magazine

Right.

Magazines about what people
are interested in.

279
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,700
There's no business here.

280

You'll never sell a magazine.
No one will ever go to a newsstand.

So, let's talk about our other idea, huh?

-I'm sorry?
<i>-Modern Sandwich.</i>

290

A monthly magazine devoted to sandwiches
and the sandwich lifestyle.

Henry's idea.

292
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:44,032
Hey, we are a country divided
in so many ways:

293
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:47,326
politically, economically, geographically.

294
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,455
But two slices of bread,
some meat, a condiment or two?

295
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,206
That's something we can all agree on.
Right, Jim?

-I'm Frank.
-Let's all be frank.

297
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:00,089
There is a huge under-served audience
for investigative sandwich journalism.

298
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,468
I-- You know, why is it so hard
to find a good tomato?

299
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,095
Are club sandwiches too exclusive?

The point is,
you don't have a fucking clue.

You're the kind of people who commute back
and forth from Westport, Connecticut.

307
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:29,619
And we have nothing to do with you.
Fucking pieces of shit.

308
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,371
[door opens]

309
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,497
[door slams shut]

310
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:34,832
You have our information.

311
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:38,795
Oh.

312
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,464
I'm gonna take it.

313
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,802
[Henry] That one, I would say,
was less promising.

314
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,512
Maybe we need to rethink our pitch.

315
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,431
Fuck those guys, you know?
They're just like my dad.

316
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:53,643
They jerk off to Eisenhower biographies.

317
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,479
Yes, but,
and this is what I love about them,

318
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,605
they have money.

319
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:02,276
So can we please just pretend for a second
that they and we are on the same side

320
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,945
until after the check clears.

321
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:07,490
Fine, who's next?

322
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,409
Hmm. Last stop.

323
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,913
We've come to you first

324
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:17,125
because we are so impressed
by what you've built with your magazine.

325
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,709
[Doug] Yogurt instead of sour cream.

326
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,670
So simple, yet so brilliant.

327
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,631
You know, they said a Weight Watcher's
magazine would never work.

328
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,592
Now we're moving 500,000 copies a month.

329
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,261
God bless the fatties.

330
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,470
-God bless 'em.
-Yes.

331
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,390
-Listen, I don't want to waste your time.
-[sighs] Here we go.

332
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:36,185
Most magazines fail within the first year.
And a laugh rag?

333
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,312
Even Hefner couldn't make that work.

334
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,898
Okay. Look, Mr. Simmons. Matty.

335
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,901
The truth is, we've already got
some offers from the big publishers.

336
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,821
-Your friend just said I was the first--
-No, I was--

337
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:50,533
But you're our choice
to publish a<i> National Lampoon.</i>

338
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,576
-Yeah.
-Yes.

339
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,661
The big publishers,
they don't get the youth market.

340
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,204
And we checked around, they said,

341
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:59,292
"Hey, you want funny, you go
to Matty Simmons because he gets funny."

342
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,043
They said that?

343
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,753
Every single one.

344
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:06,424
You know, I used to write one-liners
for Walter Winchell.

345
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,801
We<i> wuv</i> Winchell.

346
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,720
-[Matty] Hmm.
-Yeah. Hey.

347
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,144
[Doug]<i> We were in business,</i>
<i>with contracts and everything,</i>

348
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,479
<i>like real grown-ups.</i>

349
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,148
<i>And remember Alex from Harvard?</i>

350
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,983
<i>Beautiful, out of my league?</i>

351
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,402
<i>Well, we got married</i>
<i>and moved in together.</i>

352
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,821
<i>I promised it'd be the two of us</i>
<i>against the world.</i>

353
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:29,780
It's charming.

354
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,450
It may not be
the palatial estate you grew up in.

355
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,035
You know I don't care about that.

356
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:37,371
There's no jockeys' quarters
or chocolate covered chandeliers--

357
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,832
There's still no running water.
Toilet's a mess.

358
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,753
What is Henry doing here?

359
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,463
-He lives here.
-We live here.

360
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,006
It's fun, right?

361
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,261
Look, it's not ideal right now,

362
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,597
but hopefully we'll build
the business up over time,

363
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,392
and in five years, Matty has to buy
our share of the magazine, okay?

364
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,728
And then we can each afford
our own apartment.

365
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,940
And don't worry, Henry and I
will wave to you from across the park.

366
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,525
[chuckles] Okay.

367
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,276
Fine.

368
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,738
But can the two of us
at least try to have fun now,

369
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,698
not wait five years to be happy?

370
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:17,620
Of course. First few months will be
crazy busy, but I'll pencil you in.

371
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,421
[sighs]

372
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:32,093
Two pencils and a pad of paper.
That's all Matty said we could afford.

373
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,929
Well, then. Please, I insist.

374
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,348
-Oh, thank you.
-You're welcome.

375
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,016
Hey, thank you.

376
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,351
No, thank you.

377
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:44,063
-No, I think I thanked you first and--
-Well, I think I'm a little more thankful.

378
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,898
-But thank you.
-Okay, well...

379
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,984
[Doug] Did you do something new
with your hair today?

380
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,903
Can you blame me?
We called her Mary Marshmallow

381
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,613
because of her enormous breasts.

382
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,073
They were like marshmallows.

383
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,159
Hey, what are you up to later?

384
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:02,039
What! So he's a charming stud,
and I'm a dirty old man? That's ageism!

385
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,084
Hey, man.

386
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:10,047
Those are the art directors you hired?

387
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,216
They're cool. They know R. Crumb.

388
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,386
So, day one.

389
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,139
-Let's get started, huh?
-Yeah.

390
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,017
Ideas for a magazine.

391
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,019
Fill up a magazine
with words and sentences.

392
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,814
-Humorous. Humorous magazine.
-Preferably funny. Preferably funny.

393
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,483
[trills lips]

394
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,447
I'm gonna write down "comedy."

395
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,908
That's good. Let's build on that.

396
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,369
I bet Chris and George have a few ideas.

397
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,289
Maybe we should find some writers
who didn't go to Harvard.

398
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:47,335
I'm sorry, I don't quite understand.
You mean like a Yalie?

399
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,919
[Doug]<i> Oh, they were out there.</i>

400
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,796
<i>One of the first guys we brought on board</i>

401
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,466
<i>wrote dirty comic strips</i>
<i>for underground papers</i>

402
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,301
<i>and aspired to be the Antichrist.</i>

403
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,304
I am going to send you
a canister of nerve gas

404
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,390
that will explode upon opening,
you mongoloid twat!

405
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,520
You sent me the wrong records.

406
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,565
You're the Columbia Fucking Record Club!

407
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:18,157
[Doug]<i> We had a comedian from England</i>
<i>named Tony Hendra.</i>

408
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,785
Mr. Sullivan would find jokes
about the Tet Offensive.

409
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,495
-Don't you say it.
-Offensive?

410
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,999
Do you know what I find offensive?
Being a traitor to one's generation.

411
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:31,921
Know what? I am done sucking chuckles
from blue-haired septuagenarians.

412
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,216
Tell Mr. Sullivan he can take
his bloody show and shove it.

413
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:40,262
[Doug]<i> Then there was a woman who managed</i>
<i>to crash our little boy's club.</i>

414
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:43,307

418
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,776
[Anne] Look at you.

419
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,277
Where'd you get those pecs, butch?

420
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,780
Come on, little juicy buns, huh?

421

Mmm, mmm, mmm. Come on, spin around.

-Let me see that ass. Show Mama that ass.
-What? No.

423
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,038
Sorry, I was just trying to prove a point.

424
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,542
To show there's no hard feelings,
let me give you a hand job.

425

[man] Whoa.

426
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,002
Really?

[Doug]<i> Brian McConnachie.</i>
<i>Straight-up weirdo.</i>

434
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,354
Brian made more sense

435
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:34,442
once you understood that he came to us
from the planet Mogdar.

436
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,028
We also had Sean Kelly, Rick Meyerowitz.

437
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,989
So many great contributors.

438
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,784
But four is all that really fit our story,
so I'm sorry, guys.

439
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,119
Hmm.

440
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:48,998
You know, maybe if one of you
had been black, we could've included you.

441
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,460
So there were no funny black writers
in the '70s?

442
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,295
And just one funny woman?

443
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:58,466
Oh, I'm sure they were out there.
It's just that we didn't think to look.

444
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,426
You know, it was a different time.

445
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,469
-Hmm...
-Hmm...

446
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:04,180
In our defense, we also had very few Jews.

447
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,973
-Oh.
-Oh.

448
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,141
[chatter]

449
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,685
Okay, everyone. Take a seat. Take a seat.

450
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,687
Gather 'round.

451
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:16,567
Welcome, everyone,
to the<i> National Lampoon.</i>

452
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,943
I'm still working on that.

453
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,696
Mm-hmm. We have eight weeks
to put out the first issue,

454
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,698
and so far we have...

455
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:24,950
nothing.

456
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:27,995
So please remember
that there are no bad ideas.

457
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:31,290
-Apart from ideas we don't like.
-Yeah, do not pitch those.

458
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,042
-[Anne] Yeah.
-I had a few thoughts.

459
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,129
[Anne] Were we all supposed
to bring those?

460
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,923
-[man] Yes.
-[Tony] I left mine on the bus.

461
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,217
"Hitler's device
for gassing Rube Goldberg."

462
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:46,055
A Dr. Seuss story concerning
the sexual awakening of a young Toucan.

463
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,890
<i>A Concrete Jungle Book,</i>

464
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:52,520
a young white baby comes of age
above 125th Street.

465
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:53,771
That's tempting.

466
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:57,149
One of those baby books,
but for a war baby in Vietnam.

467
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,027
<i>Baby's First Wound,</i> that kind of thing.
Adorable.

468
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,863
How about this?
<i>The Joys of Wife-Tasting.</i>

469
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,574
This wife has a fruity flavor,
exceptional finish.

470
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,160
This wife had a vinegary bouquet.

471
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,454
<i>Tarzan of the Cows.</i>

472
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,581
<i>Nancy Reagan's Dating Dos and Don'ts.</i>

473
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,042
<i>-You're a Good Man, Charlie Manson.</i>
-Tempting.

474
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,045
"Upon seeing his condition, Ms. Braddock
said, 'Winston, you're drunk.'

475
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:21,173
Mustering all his dignity,
Churchill cocked an eyebrow and rejoined,

476
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:24,927
with that famous Churchill wit,
'Shove it up your ass, you ugly cunt.'"

477
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,887
[laughing]

478
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,430
[Doug] Yeah, really great, guys.

479
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,558
-Matty, where you going?
-That's history.

480
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,810
-Come on!
-[Tony] Here's a cover idea.

481
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:35,312
Nixon with a long wooden nose.

482
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:36,564
[chuckles]

483
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:39,316
[chair squeaks]

484
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:42,570
You know, like Pinocchio.

485
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,948
It's really hard-hitting.

486
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,491
[Doug] Boo!

487
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:48,701
[laughing]

488
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,829
You know, I hear<i> The Village Voice</i>
has very good benefits.

489
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,415
[Doug] We talked about bad ideas.
We had a whole conversation--

490
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,834
-So much for the free exchange of ideas.
-[Anne] No, wait, wait, wait!

491
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,211
What if Nixon is just like the emperor?

492
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,297
But he's got no clothes, so--

493
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,090
[laughing]

494
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,593
What was his name? I've literally
already forgotten who that was.

495
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:08,387
Hey, hey, despite Tony's horrible idea,

496
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,889
I think this magazine
is gonna hit it out of the park.

497
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:11,932
[clamoring]

498
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:13,100
-[Doug] Come on!
-[Brian] Shit.

499
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:16,228
It's a total failure, we're selling
less than half our print run.

500
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,314
And what is with the goddamn duck?

501
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,899
-I never did get the duck.
-The duck is our mascot.

502
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:23,652
Do you know what the cigarette companies
are telling me?

503
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:26,905
"I'm not putting my ad
in this underground piece of shit!"

504
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:28,073
It's ugly!

505
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:32,369
It makes me physically ill to say this,
but I agree with Matty.

506
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:33,704
[Matty] Thank you, Henry.

507
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,668
Okay, who cares if it's ugly?

508
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,295
Comedy doesn't have to be pretty.

509
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,546
It should be raw.

510
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:43,756
Fucking rock and roll.

511
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,966
Doug, we have to fire the art directors.

512
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:48,802
What? But they hang out with David Bowie!

513
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:52,139
I know that might not impress an heir
to Canadian woolen mills--

514
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,224
-Hurtful.
-But their stuff is funny.

515
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:56,810
No, it looks funny.

516
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:58,479
Doug, there's a difference.

517
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:03,942
Matty and I had a meeting
with the art director for<i> Family Health.</i>

518
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:06,695
Oh,<i> Family Health!</i>
Oh, that's a funny magazine.

519
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,113
Are you kidding me?

520
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:09,031
Look.

521
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,493
Okay. What am I looking at?

522
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:16,330
He redesigned their old material.
Straight. Deadpan.

523
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,332
So the art isn't fighting the joke.

524
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,085
This is what your friends
down the hall did.

525
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,461
And this is the new guy.

526
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,462
Nostalgia

527
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,797
I see what you're saying.

528
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:26,590
It is pretty good.

529
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,301
It's better.

530
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,180
And the duck?

531
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,099
No duck.

532
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:44,024
Tempting.
I'm glad you finally saw the light.

533
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:45,609
I can be very persuasive.

534
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:47,903
If I fire those guys,

535
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,280
they're gonna make me do
so much acid with them.

536
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:52,366
-Then I'll fire them.
-No, I'll do it.

537
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,451
Hey, guys. I got some bad news.

538
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:56,662
Stay.

539
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,247
Ladies, let's lift those drinks.

540
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:01,959
Perfect.

541
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:07,715
No, the arms should be like slightly bent.

542
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,981
[Matty]<i> Kenney, Beard!</i>

543
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:27,192
We are being sued by Disney
for $8 million!

544
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,361
Well, Matty, maybe it wasn't
such a hot idea

545
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,363
to have Minnie Mouse flashing her tits.

546
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:33,073
This was not my idea.

547
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:34,742
I distinctly remember you saying,

548
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:38,662
"Boys, it'll be fine, she has pasties on.
This is completely my idea."

549
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,038
That does sound like Matty.

550
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:41,874
You having fun yet?

551
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,959
One could say fun is being had.

552
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,837
Okay, Michael, let's do this.

553
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,799
This is for the magazine, right?

554
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:59,600
Volkswagen! Volkswagen is suing us
for $30 million over your ad.

555
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,311
[chuckles] My ad!

556
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,897
I can't tell you how great it feels
to be valued like this.

557
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,615
The Mormons are protesting!

558
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,867
The feminists hate us!

559
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:20,579
The Catholics.
What did we do to the Catholics?

560
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,080
Liza Minnelli?

561
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:24,291
The American Nazi Party!

562
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,002
Wait, this is fan mail.

563
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,086
[Mary] Such a good boy.

564
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,256
[Doug] He looks too happy.
I know that look. That dog is in paradise.

565
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,467
Mary, I have to ask you
to step out of the shot.

566
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,844
-You're not gonna hurt him, right?
-No, why would I hurt him?

567
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,095
-What are you doing?
-Don't worry.

568
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:38,847
-I don't think there's bullets in there.
-Should I fire?

569
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,474
-Step back.

[Henry] Hey.

595
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,261
[Doug] Yeah.

596
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,138
[Henry] I have a confession to make.

597
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,515
When we started, I never thought

598
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,768
it would be much more
than the two of us writing jokes.

599
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,438
Now it's turned into...

600
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:11,940
all this.

601
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:18,864
But as long as at the center of it,
it's you and me working together...

602
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,708
McSorley's is still open.

603
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:34,212
You want to grab a drink
and watch sailors hit on runaway teens?

604
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,426
Doug?

605
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,055
Doug.

606
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:01,073
This one's funnier.

607
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:09,831
Is there such a thing
as "over the line" to you?

608
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:12,084
A lot of people think
your material goes too far.

609
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,253
Well, a lot of people voted for Nixon.

610
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:17,673
And I suppose those people
aren't "your people."

611
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,969
Is that a marijuana cigarette?

612
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,515
No.

613
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,813
Let's talk about this,
the "Sexual Frustration" issue.

614
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,440
There's a picture in here
that we can't even show

615
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,985
of a naked black woman.

616
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,236

If we don't cut that gag
about Nixon's daughter,

RCA is gonna drop the album!

[Doug]<i> Then you start a live show.</i>

774
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,705
<i>And that's a hit, too.</i>

775

<i>Yes, I know success is a great thing,</i>

776

<i>why maybe you can't handle it.</i>

777
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,047
<i>To deal with the stress, you smoke dope,</i>

778
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,840
<i>but that makes it harder</i>
<i>to meet the deadlines,</i>

779
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:22,634

780
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,137
Doug! How much time
did you spend on this coupon?

781
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:29,432
[Doug]<i> Well, shit, maybe a little LSD</i>

782
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:32,185

<i>and you're still tripping,</i>

783
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:35,605

<i>You feel bad about</i>

<i>Not that one. No, that one.</i>
<i>Well, that one, too.</i>

[Doug]
<i>You probably shouldn't stay out so late,</i>

Doug, did you break the machine again?

[Doug] Peter, Lucy,
is this where the college reunion is?

805
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,956
[Peter] Hey, man, good to see you.

I did the right thing, right?

-Right?

Michael, you're being unreasonable.

If the nitroglycerin hasn't leaked out,
it's harmless. I could eat it.

00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:23,416
But it has leaked out.

847
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:26,794
That's what I'm telling you, is that
the nitroglycerin, it's leaked out.

I'm warning you
that I'm going to rape you. Ow!

857
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:48,983
I don't want to kick him out,
but he's been here for weeks.

858
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:52,070
He needs us right now. Maybe we should
take him to the carousel again.

859
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:53,404
No. Hey.

860
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,282
What's this?

861
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:59,744
Oh, this is
<i>Teenage Commies From Outer Space.</i>

862
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,829
The great American novel.
I finally started writing it.

863
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,415
-That's great, Doug.
-[chuckles] Yeah. Thank you.

864
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:06,751
It's 1956 and aliens attack.

865
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,462
It's like Salinger
meets Mark Twain on acid.

866
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:10,713
-Wow.
-Yeah.

867
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:13,674
They're sharing a drink with Bukowski
while going down on Jane Austen.

868
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,551
Just stay with that metaphor for a second.

869
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:18,638
Oh, no, here comes James Joyce.
He's got some baby oil. [laughs]

870
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,935
As you go through it,
pay attention to what you're doing

871
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,312
so I don't have to deal with it.
That's the whole point.

872
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,480
Where's my stuff?

873
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,941
-I know what a dictionary is.
-Henry, where's my stuff?

874
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:33,027
-I don't know where your stuff is.
-Okay, cut the bullshit, I want an answer!

875
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,279
-Whose stuff is on my desk?
-I don't know whose stuff--

876
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:37,949
We were gone for two days,
and you gave her desk away?

877
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,034
[Anne] Doug's gone for months,
but you don't touch his desk.

878
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:41,744
You won't put my stuff in the magazine,

879
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,704
now you really want
to send a message, right?

880
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:46,791
-Clearly, you hate women.
-Look, it was probably the cleaners.

881
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,417
-Then fire those bitches, okay?
-Henry.

882
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:51,420
Because here's the option,
either they go or we go.

883
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:55,925
Henry. Henry. This water fountain
hasn't been operational in 15 days.

884
00:43:58,344 --> 00:43:59,720
That's what you've been
saying "Henry" for?

885
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:00,638
I'm very thirsty.

886
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:05,143
Look, you're not quitting.
We'll talk to Matty. He'll smooth it over.

887
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:07,436
I would rather butt-fuck cancer...

888
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:09,897
-God.
-than shake hands with Matty Simmons.

889
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:12,066
-It's called--
-This is half what you owe me,

890
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,234
you cheap fuck.

891
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,278
Between the ticket sales
and the albums--

892
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:18,906
It's<i> National Lampoon's Lemmings</i>
not <i>Tony Hendra's Lemmings.</i>

893
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:19,907
What are you doing?

894
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:23,494
I'd like to report a robbery, please.

895
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:24,453
Okay, come on.

896
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:28,583
A man called Matty Simmons,
whom I have apprehended at 635 Madison,

897
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,001
has stolen money from me.

898
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,252
And another thing.

899
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:34,547
If I choose to bring a grenade to work,

900
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,300
that is my right as an Irish-American!

901
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:38,885
-You people.
-What the hell, man?

902
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:41,846
You people. You're dangerous.

903
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,347
-Let's go.
-[man] Are you all right?

904
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:44,682
[groans]

905
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:48,769
Holy shit.

906
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:57,361
I left a half-empty grape Fanta here.
Has anyone seen it?

907
00:44:58,446 --> 00:44:59,280
No?

908
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,116
It was about yay big.

909
00:45:09,749 --> 00:45:12,460
Should I be
for the Black Panthers or against?

910
00:45:16,756 --> 00:45:19,425
So, uh... what's going on?

911
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:21,218
What's going on?

912
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:24,055
Well...

913
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,556
O'Donoghue quit again.

914
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:28,851
He and Anne are now dating,
so she quit, too.

915
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:32,355
Tony stole a sketch from Monty Python
and used it in Lemmings,

916
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,981
which is fantastic.

917
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:38,027
And Matty is claiming he can't afford
to buy us out next year,

918
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,529
in flagrant violation of our contract.

919
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,324
Oh. Gosh.

920
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:47,328
But, you know,
I meant, what's going on with you?

921
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,580
That is what's going on with me.

922
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,583
This is what you left me with.

923
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:57,171
Well, it wasn't
a completely wasted breakdown.

924
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:58,881
I finished the novel.

925
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:14,605
-You want me to read this now?
-Would you?

926
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:21,028
<i>Teenage Commies From Outer Space.</i>

927
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:41,674
It's...

928
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:46,887
-It sucks.
-[Henry] Yeah.

929
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:51,183
It's done. It's not worth talking about.

930
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:55,980
It's good to have you back, Doug.

931
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,818
And then February can be
the<i> Strange Sex</i> issue.

932
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:05,489
Yes. The<i> Strange Sex--</i> And we should
do an issue within the issue,

933
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:06,782
<i>The National Lampoof.</i>

934
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:07,742
[chuckling]

935
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,911
<i>Instead of Our Bodies, Ourselves,</i>
<i>Our Bodies, None of Your Business.</i>

936
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:12,580
[Tony] None of your business.

937
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,415
A magazine,<i> Playdead.</i>

938
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:18,919
Erotic photos of women's corpses

939
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:21,672
hanging from nooses, head in the oven,

940
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:24,341
-maybe one of them fell down the stairs.
-[Tony] Jesus Christ.

941
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:27,470
I was thinking
we could write up Nixon's resume,

942
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,764
you know, now that he's back
on the job market?

943
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:33,893
Yes, like the piece PJ has
in the current issue,

944
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:36,645
which is available on newsstands,
if you want to buy a copy,

945
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:38,981
-you could use it as research.
-Okay, Tony. Yeah.

946
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:41,275
We had something like that
in the last issue. It's not important.

947
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,945
-I think "play dead" is the way to go.
-We'll let Brian get all the dead bodies.

948
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:47,782
-A braille version of<i> The Joy of Sex.</i>
-Oh, my gosh.

949
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:50,284
Hey, where's my tennis racket?

950
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:54,205
I used to keep my tennis racket
behind the filing cabinet.

951
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:55,122
[Henry] Hey, Doug.

952
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:57,124
Doug. One second.

953
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:58,918
[Tony] Glory hole page

954
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:02,797
and have an illustration
of a lavatory cubicle on the back.

955
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,715
-[Brian] A lavatory cubicle.
-[Tony] And...

956
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:07,009
Is this about the tennis racket?

957
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:08,761
[chuckles] Uh, no.

958
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:13,224
Um... listen, I was thinking maybe
you could do another special project.

959
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,141
-You know?
-Yeah?

960
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:16,102
Away from normal deadlines.

961
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:17,686
You'll get out of the office.

962
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:20,564
You could do it with PJ.
What do you think?

963
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,067
-Sound good?
-Do you need smokes?

964
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,443
-Yeah.
-He's gonna go get smokes.

965
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,780
What about a map
to glory holes in your neighborhood?

966
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,406
-It just says, "Your house."
-[Henry] What'd I miss?

967
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:30,825
These people don't need encouragement.

968
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:33,828
A cartoon, "Jewish Moon Landing."

969
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:34,954
[chuckling]

970
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,705
[Brian]
Sort of a differently-shaped helmet.

971
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:39,708
[Doug]<i> I'm not sure if Henry was trying</i>
<i>to save me from embarrassment</i>

972
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:43,254
<i>or if he truly believed</i>
<i>I could still create the great American--</i>

973
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:44,755
<i>I don't know, something.</i>

974
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,424
<i>But either way, we found it.</i>

975
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:50,761
<i>An idea full of paranoia and nostalgia,</i>

976
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:53,848
<i>the meaningless cruelty</i>
<i>of being young in America.</i>

977
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:56,475
<i>The high school yearbook.</i>

978
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:58,144
They're all the same.

979
00:48:58,227 --> 00:49:01,105
It's like every single shop teacher went
to the same barber.

980
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,857
It's authoritarian government, man.

981
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,900
It's like we're living
in an oppressed nation.

982
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:06,152
Yes, it is.

983
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:08,445
[PJ] Salute to the seniors.
Yes, this is exactly--

984
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:10,072
They make you salute these people.

985
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:12,700
They all have thousand-yard stares,
you know what I mean?

986
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:21,792
You wonder why Nixon's the way he is,
it's because he went to high school, man.

987
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:26,213
Chess club, glee club, future homemakers.

988
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:29,967
Everything screwed up about our culture,
it all begins right here.

989
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,135
All these forced smiles.

990
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,970
You know, whether we know it or not,

991
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:36,182
every high school sorts us
into the same exact types.

992
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:38,309
It's Nazi social engineering.

993
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:39,393
Bully,

994
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:40,477
introvert,

995
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:41,770
teacher's pet,

996
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:42,813
delinquent,

997
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:44,023
foreign exchange student,

998
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,357
virgin,

999
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:47,651
perfect perky princess,

1000
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:49,278
Spazzy McSpaz,

1001
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:51,155
wacky class clown.

1002
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,326
[Doug]<i> There's a type for everyone.</i>

1003
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:57,036
<i>Whether you're the rich dick,</i>

1004
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,412
<i>future homosexual,</i>

1005
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,080
<i>beatnik, tramp,</i>

1006
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:01,373
<i>overlooked black kid,</i>

1007
00:50:01,457 --> 00:50:02,583
<i>the dictator,</i>

1008
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:03,667
<i>the nobody,</i>

1009
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:05,836
<i>and, of course, the kid who died.</i>

1010
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:09,965
<i>This was the best Senior Year ever,</i>
<i>except for the tragic deaths</i>

1011
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:12,968
<i>of Howard Havermeyer</i>
<i>and President Kennedy,</i>

1012
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:14,595
<i>and the car accident after prom.</i>

1013
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:16,347
All right, ready, girls?

1014
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:19,683
Three, two, one.

1015
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:26,523
[Tony] "The Lampoon's hit parody
of the high school yearbook,

1016
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:29,693
now on track
to sell over one million copies,

1017
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:34,323
is the greatest example of group writing
since the King James Bible."

1018
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:36,867
-And you didn't write a word of it.
-I'm in the group.

1019
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:40,162
We all work together. I mean,
I gave everyone credit for "Lemmings."

1020
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:42,456
-[man] I must have missed that.
-[Doug] Matty.

1021
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,124
Those two look armed for battle.

1022
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:46,794
Well, it's been five years.
Matty has to buy them out.

1023
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:49,797
Time to feast on the fatted calf.

1024
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:55,177
Matty, we need to talk about this now.

1025
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:57,805
Look, I know why you're here.
I know what day it is.

1026
00:50:58,639 --> 00:50:59,723
Let me explain this.

1027
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:01,976
You boys are victims of your own success.

1028
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,603
I don't have the cash
to pay you ten times earnings.

1029
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:07,731
We got too much earnings.
I can't cover it.

1030
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:10,943
My apologies for making the yearbook
such a hit. I'll aim lower next time.

1031
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,278
You signed a contract.

1032
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:15,322
He didn't fulfill his contract, did he?
He disappeared on us.

1033
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:18,117
I still put out the fucking magazine.
Every month.

1034
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,119
We just want to be paid what we deserve.

1035
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:22,705
I know. Here's what I can do now. Okay?

1036
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,790
More stock. A lot more stock,

1037
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:28,043
and I pay the entire sum off
in ten years. Okay?

1038
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:31,088
I mean, doesn't that sound better
than fucking Matty over a barrel?

1039
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,092
I knew it.

1040
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,844
[Doug]
<i>I had to get Henry what he deserved.</i>

1041
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,887
<i>And the only way to change Matty's mind</i>

1042
00:51:38,971 --> 00:51:42,933
<i>was a well thought out argument,</i>
<i>delivered clearly and calmly.</i>

1043
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:45,811
No, no, no, no, no!

1044
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:46,854
We want our money!

1045
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,732
I fucked up, fine.
But Henry kept it going.

1046
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,317
And we want our money! Now!

1047
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:52,651
Henry.

1048
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,488
Come on. Let's go! Do it!

1049
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,451
-[Matty] Hey!
-[Doug] We want our money!

1050
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:01,994
I think it's going well.

1051
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,620
I'm going for the checks.

1052
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,708
You two are pirates.

1053
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:09,460
[Doug] Here's a pen.

1054
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:14,757
[Matty] You assholes.

1055
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:16,884
Do you know what you've done?

1056
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:17,885
You've ruined me.

1057
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,137
You've ruined this company. You know that.

1058
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,639
We made this company.

1059
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,646
We should celebrate, huh?

1060
00:52:30,439 --> 00:52:32,608
Come on, let's go buy you a new pipe.

1061
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:34,902
Henry?

1062
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:36,779
Tempting?

1063
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:38,906
They're all expecting a slice of the pie.

1064
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,869
It could get rather awkward.

1065
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:46,121
I don't get it. What's the bit?

1066
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,167
You might need those.

1067
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,003
I'm digging the commitment.

1068
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:57,591
You said if it ever stopped being fun...

1069
00:52:58,884 --> 00:52:59,718
So...

1070
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:00,677
[scoffs]

1071
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:03,055
We just got the money.
I just got us the money.

1072
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:05,432
No, you got Matty
to write us a check, Doug.

1073
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:07,101
I earned that money.

1074
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:11,271
-I'm done.

01:01:19,718 --> 01:01:22,387
Burns you down to nothing,
but the glow is awful pretty.

1227
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:23,722
Okay, so he's just upset

1228
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:26,516
because Lorne wants us
to write sketches for the Muppets.

1229
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,143
I don't write for felt.

1230
01:01:28,727 --> 01:01:30,770
Oh, not you too, Brian.

1231
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:32,772
They offered me 30 pieces of silver.

1232
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:34,858
You know how I feel about silver.

1233

-Hi, Doug.
-Hey, lover.

1239
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:49,164
You should meet Lorne.

1240
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:50,916
Oh, the comedy boy-wonder, huh?

1241
01:01:50,999 --> 01:01:54,753
No. Hey, there can be two boy-wonders.
Boys-wonder.

1242
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,005
What do boys wonder? Excuse you.

1243
01:01:57,088 --> 01:02:00,050
Lorne, this is Doug Kenney
from<i> The National Lampoon.</i>

1244
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:01,760
Hi, Doug. Pleasure to meet you.

1245
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:04,679
Thanks. I like the show. It's great stuff.

1246
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:06,890
Right. Well, you know, we do what we can.

1247
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:10,977
Doug, uh, you get
the kind of comedy we're doing here.

1248
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:13,730
You and I, you know,
we share a sensibility.

1249
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:15,941
Yeah, and a cast and writers. Yeah.

1250
01:02:16,024 --> 01:02:18,902
Spotting talent
is the most important job I have.

1251
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:20,987
-You can understand that.
-Yeah.

1252
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:23,990
I was wondering,
would you be interested in joining us?

1253
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:26,201
[scoffs] You want me to write for you?

1254
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:29,537
That sounds great!
Yeah, I'd get to be your employee?

1255
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:31,665
Well, that's a fairly narrow way
to put that, Doug.

1256
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:34,209
-You think I've flamed out.
-That's not what I'm saying at all.

1257
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:35,293
It sounds like it is.

1258
01:02:35,377 --> 01:02:39,172
What I'm saying is I think you could
make this show even better than it is.

1259
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:42,092
Okay, well, I don't need a handout.

1260
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:46,596
Oh, here. You're probably gonna steal it
from me anyway.

1261
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:51,309
Game show sketch,<i> Name Those Bats.</i>

1262
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:53,520
Contestants are in a barn,
bats flying at them,

1263
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,146
they have to name the bats.

1264
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:58,149
[Doug]<i> I wasn't gonna let</i>
<i>some TV show steal my thunder.</i>

1265
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:00,026
<i>I had to set my sights higher.</i>

1266
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:02,028
<i>So Harold and I came up</i>
<i>with the perfect idea</i>

1267
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:04,906
<i>for the first</i> National Lampoon<i> movie.</i>

1268
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:07,117
<i>Laser Orgy Girls.</i>

1269
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:08,743
[Doug] Huh?

1270
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:11,538
It's about Charles Manson
in the tenth grade, huh?

1271
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:14,124
The man's visited by aliens or a UFO,
whatever you want--

1272
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:15,875
Guys, Manson in high school?

1273
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:16,876
You're right.

1274
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:19,546
We'll put him in college. That's funnier.

1275
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,464
No, forget Manson. It's a bad idea.

1276
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:23,216
So what are you saying, Matty?

1277
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,926
You don't want a movie
about Charles Manson?

1278
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:26,261
We got one shot for a movie.

1279
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:29,264
Manson in high school is a parody ad
for the magazine.

1280
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:31,182
-If it's a rights issue--
-We need a big idea.

1281
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:33,059
-My uncle's a lawyer.
-A big movie idea.

1282
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:34,936
We could find a way
to get Manson involved.

1283
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:37,439
Harold. I think Matty
might actually have a point here.

1284
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:42,944
-What's the bit we're doing?
-No, this isn't a bit.

1285
01:03:43,028 --> 01:03:45,280
Look, what's the most popular thing
in the magazine?

1286
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:46,489
-The tits.
-Yes, the tits.

1287
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:50,035
But also, like, you know,
<i>Night of the Seven Fires.</i>

1288
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:52,245
<i>Pinto's First Lay.</i>
All the Chris Miller stuff.

1289
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:53,747
-The fraternity stories.
-Yeah.

1290
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:58,251
We have a chance to make the great
American college movie here, plus tits.

1291
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,087
Matty, get Chris Miller on the line.

1292
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:03,298
One second. I like this.

1293
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:07,469
God damn it. I'm not your secretary!

1294
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:10,180
[Doug]<i> Together with Chris Miller,</i>

1295
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:12,515
<i>we wrote down</i>
<i>every funny college story,</i>

1296
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:14,601
<i>every crazy character we could think of.</i>

1297
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:17,520
<i>Then we hooked up with Ivan Reitman,</i>

1298
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:20,690
<i>a Canadian filmmaker</i>
<i>who'd produced a stage show for us.</i>

1299
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:24,235
Delta was by far the craziest frat
at Dartmouth.

1300
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,196
They use to call us the "Animal House."

1301
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:27,572
That's a good title!

1302
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:28,782
Yeah!

<i>-Look, guys.</i>
-Hey, Brad.

1308

This is 114.

1309

Well, this is their first movie, Brad.

1310

-I would never make this.
<i>-I'm surprised to hear you say that.</i>

1311

1313
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,140
Okay, look, I couldn't do this unless
it was, like, for under $2 million.

1314
01:04:54,224 --> 01:04:55,975
-We can do that.
<i>-Really?</i>

[Doug]
<i>So with the studio's ringing endorsement,</i>

1321
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:08,488

[Doug]<i> It was a classic tale</i>
<i>of slobs versus snobs.</i>

1325

<i>The Deltas versus the Omegas.</i>

1326
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:22,627
<i>We hired an ensemble</i>
<i>of mostly unknown actors.</i>

A futile and stupid gesture be done--

1330
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:30,802
<i>But we also needed a heavy hitter,</i>

1331

<i>a comic superstar that we knew</i>
<i>could deliver the goods.</i>

"Well, what the hell we supposed to do,
you moron?"

I just memorized my one line.

1335
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:43,064
You cannot shoot a scene

1336
01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:46,067
where they leave their dates behind
at a black nightclub!

1337
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:47,610
I'm not having this discussion.

-Okay, Doug.
-Chris.

1339

to have a discussion.

1340
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:53,908
-Just calm down, Brad.
-This goes too far.

1341
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:56,661
You put this in front of an audience,
we'll have race riots.

-Doug is one of the writers.
-And why is he annoying me?

1346
01:06:08,256 --> 01:06:09,674
I ask myself the same thing.

1347
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:11,801
Actually, you wouldn't pay
to have writers on set.

1348
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:13,553
I'm here as an actor. It's a loophole.

1349
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:17,307
Now, as for this nightclub scene,
hey, it's funny and it's honest.

1350
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:21,352
And I say this not only as a writer
of the film, but as a black man.

1351

1376
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,608
I went for the full fondue set this time.

I knew we had something special.

1383
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:08,126
-I always knew that you would know that.
-The kids were rioting in the aisles.

1384
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:10,545
-Yeah, at least they weren't race riots.
-Gimme a break.

1385
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:12,630
You thought I was worried about that?
I wasn't worried about that.

1386
01:08:12,714 --> 01:08:15,925
In fact, we had a screening
for Richard Pryor. He thought it was fine.

1387
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:17,552
-I mean, that's one cool cat.
-Yeah.

1388
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:19,137
He's a cool, cool cat.

-Well, you're a tool.

A couple of jokes?

1395
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:36,654
Did I tell you
how much I loved your movie?

1396

Oh, the movie's not important.

1397

and how much you loved my movie.

1399
01:08:41,743 --> 01:08:45,371
Okay, now, listen. I made
a big decision in the last 40 seconds.

I think it's time to move to Hollywood.

1406
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:08,394
We are thinking alike.
I'm gonna open an office in Beverly Hills.

Now is not the time to leave.

Now's the time to make more.

1411
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:22,992
You'll make other movies.
They just won't involve me.

1412
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,286
What about the magazine?

1413
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:27,413
Weight Watchers will be fine without me.

-That's a lot of negatives.
-I don't disagree.

1422

Okay. Well, we could also talk
about the prep school script,

-No, don't worry about it. It's all right.

1681
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:11,445
-Don't worry about it.
-What time's your--

1682
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:13,572
What time's your press thing?

1683
01:23:15,908 --> 01:23:16,992
[scoffs]

1684
01:23:17,075 --> 01:23:19,328
-I'm fine, okay?
-I know.

1685
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:20,704
I see what you're, uh...

1686
01:23:20,787 --> 01:23:25,417
No, I don't need you
to take care of me, okay?

1687
01:23:25,501 --> 01:23:29,338
[chuckles]
Now he wants to take care of me. Yeah.

1688
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:34,092
I do care about you, Doug.

1689
01:23:38,388 --> 01:23:39,389
Well...

1690
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:41,016
too late.

1691
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:45,604
You know what?
I'm happy that you reached out.

1692
01:23:47,314 --> 01:23:51,527
Yeah. Well, maybe I shouldn't have.
I don't know how this feels.

1693
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:54,196
-What are you talking about?
-I-- I should go.

1694
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:56,490
-Really?
-Yeah.

1695
01:23:57,199 --> 01:24:00,202
Doug, you can call me anytime.

1696
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:04,706
Thank you. Yeah, I will.

1697
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:07,417
-I'm gonna take this.
-Hey!

1698
01:24:07,918 --> 01:24:09,628
[Henry] It's all right. I got it.

1699
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:12,297
-Should we call you a cab?
-I'm a cab.

1700
01:24:14,132 --> 01:24:15,551
He called himself a cab.

1701
01:24:22,266 --> 01:24:23,392
[Brad] All right, folks.

1702
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:27,896
Get your questions ready
for the cast and crew of<i> Caddyshack.</i>

1703
01:24:31,275 --> 01:24:34,152
Okay, yeah.
Okay, I think we're gonna get started.

1704
01:24:35,362 --> 01:24:38,282
You've all seen the movie.
It's great, isn't it?

1705
01:24:38,865 --> 01:24:40,742
Yeah, it's a funny movie.

1706
01:24:41,618 --> 01:24:42,578
Really funny movie.

1707
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:45,080
Oh, it sucked!

1708
01:24:45,706 --> 01:24:47,374
Didn't everybody think it was terrible?

1709
01:24:47,457 --> 01:24:50,836
Okay, this is-- Everyone, this is
the hilarious Doug Kenney, our writer.

1710
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:52,337
Douglas Kenney, everyone.

1711
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:54,631
Okay, he's joking.

1712
01:24:54,715 --> 01:24:56,091
I'm not joking.

1713
01:24:56,174 --> 01:24:58,260
Fuck this fucking movie.

1714
01:24:58,343 --> 01:24:59,177
Fuck the gopher.

1715
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:02,264
There was a mechanical gopher.
It's not even a real gopher.

1716
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:04,725
It's a piece of shit.

1717
01:25:04,808 --> 01:25:08,061
I don't know, I think this guy's
a couple sandwiches short of a picnic.

1718
01:25:08,145 --> 01:25:08,979
[laughing]

1719
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:11,607
That's the kind of shit
that's in the movie!

1720
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:13,025
-Hey.
-[Doug stammers]

1721
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:14,985
You guys, come on.
What are you doing up there?

1722
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:17,321
Are you talking about
what a piece of shit it is?

1723
01:25:17,404 --> 01:25:19,323
-Honey, let's go.
-Is that-- No, no, no.

1724
01:25:19,406 --> 01:25:23,410
I know I'm saying what a piece of shit
it is a bunch, but I'm very proud of it.

1725
01:25:23,493 --> 01:25:25,829
This-- 'Cause I-- It's like my baby.

1726
01:25:25,912 --> 01:25:29,791
It's like a shit baby
that I laid out there.

1727
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:32,419
And I'm really proud of it.
And I know we all are.

1728
01:25:32,502 --> 01:25:35,547
Doug! That's enough.

1729
01:25:36,882 --> 01:25:38,258
What are you guys doing here?

1730
01:25:38,342 --> 01:25:41,470
-You tell us.
-Doug, you begged us to come.

1731
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:43,889
I did?

1732
01:25:48,268 --> 01:25:51,480
Well, I guess
you were right all along, huh?

1733
01:25:52,022 --> 01:25:54,524
It's just big fucking waste of time.

1734
01:25:56,652 --> 01:25:58,737
I'm a fucking piece of shit.

1735
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:01,323
-[Kathryn] Oh!
-[audience gasps]

1736
01:26:01,406 --> 01:26:02,532
[Kathryn] Okay. Hey. Hey.

1737
01:26:02,616 --> 01:26:04,576
Get him the hell out of here, please.

1738
01:26:06,912 --> 01:26:09,039
[Brad] Okay, sorry, everybody.

1739
01:26:09,122 --> 01:26:11,249
Yeah, well, just-- Let's--

1740
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:14,169
[Chevy] Buddy, why don't we go
get some rest somewhere?

1741
01:26:15,379 --> 01:26:18,006
We should work together again, huh?

1742
01:26:27,474 --> 01:26:29,017
[grunts]

1743
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:29,935
Blowjob!

1744
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:31,561
Cocksucker!

1745
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:33,230

-Balls-on-my-face!
-Ronald Reagan!

1749
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:39,152
Chevy!

1750
01:26:43,490 --> 01:26:44,533
What's today?

1751
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:48,870
Well, it's Russian solstice, so...

1752
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:52,874
Six.

1753
01:26:53,291 --> 01:26:55,127
No. It's a two.

1754
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:56,211
Hmm.

1755
01:26:57,504 --> 01:26:58,547
I-- I--

1756
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:01,133
Dinah Shore is-- No.

1757
01:27:02,926 --> 01:27:04,636
Oh, I got it. Doug...

1758
01:27:06,763 --> 01:27:07,806
It's Thursday.

1759
01:27:10,183 --> 01:27:12,352
-That's six days clean.
-Feels good.

1760
01:27:12,436 --> 01:27:13,854
It feels great.

1761
01:27:14,563 --> 01:27:16,314
I haven't felt this healthy in years.

1762
01:27:16,398 --> 01:27:17,941
I feel like myself again.

1763
01:27:19,443 --> 01:27:20,527
[Doug sighs]

1764
01:27:23,947 --> 01:27:25,365
-You think we should--
-I'll call my guy.

1765
01:27:34,374 --> 01:27:36,501
We'll just have the one ball, right?

1766
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:37,919
One ball.

1767
01:27:42,132 --> 01:27:44,718
-You're the handsomest man in comedy.
-Second handsomest.

1768
01:27:44,801 --> 01:27:48,430
...96, 97, 98, 99, 93, 94, 95, 96...

1769
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:50,515
-Am I bothering you?
-No.

1770
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:53,393
93, 94, 95...

1771
01:27:53,477 --> 01:27:55,312
182, 83, 84, 85.

1772
01:27:57,564 --> 01:27:58,398
You win.

1773
01:27:58,482 --> 01:28:02,319
"Caddyshack never finds
a consistent comic note of its own,

1774
01:28:02,402 --> 01:28:05,739
but it plays host
to all sorts of approaches from its stars,

1775
01:28:06,364 --> 01:28:09,618
who sometimes hardly seem
to be occupying the same movie."

1776
01:28:10,076 --> 01:28:13,413
I just think it's weird the Pope
is weighing in on this at all.

1777
01:28:13,497 --> 01:28:14,539
You know?

1778
01:28:18,293 --> 01:28:20,796
Oh, that was so rude of me.
I never even offered you any nuts.

1779
01:28:23,423 --> 01:28:25,634
So what else did the Pope have to say?

1780
01:28:26,593 --> 01:28:28,053
Anything worth note?

1781
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:30,347
[Kathryn] Doug?

1782
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:36,937
-Hey! Babe.
-Hi.

1783
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:39,648
-What's up, babe? Hey, hey, hey.
-Hi.

1784
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:40,690
[Doug] Mmm.

1785
01:28:40,774 --> 01:28:41,608
-Oh.
-[Kathryn] Hi.

1786
01:28:43,235 --> 01:28:45,320
Wait, where's, uh... Chevy?

1787
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:48,031
I thought he left last night.

1788
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:52,661
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, last night. Of course. Yeah.

1789
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:53,578
Oh, hey.

1790
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:57,374
God, look at this place.
He forgot to-- Chevy forgot to--

1791
01:28:57,457 --> 01:29:02,921
I asked him to, like, vacuum and stuff,
and he obviously did not vacuum.

1792
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:05,006
He forgot to do it,
so let me clean up a little.

1793
01:29:05,090 --> 01:29:07,050
There. There we go.

1794
01:29:07,133 --> 01:29:10,762
And then let's--
You know, let's go, snorkeling. Right?

1795
01:29:10,846 --> 01:29:12,430
Oh, it's good to see you.

1796
01:29:14,933 --> 01:29:19,521
Once the new house is furnished,
I thought maybe we could throw a party.

1797
01:29:20,105 --> 01:29:21,815
Maybe over Labor Day.

1798
01:29:22,941 --> 01:29:25,902
-You'll be back home by then.
-Yeah, of course.

1799
01:29:26,278 --> 01:29:27,445
I think so.

1800
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:30,198
Doug.

1801
01:29:32,576 --> 01:29:33,869
You need to decide.

1802
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:37,956
On the furniture?

1803
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:40,625
Don't make me choose
between Pennsylvania Dutch and Colonial.

1804
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:41,710
-You know I'm torn.
-Doug.

1805
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:44,254
You need to decide
if you're serious about getting better.

1806
01:29:44,337 --> 01:29:46,673
You can't just stay here forever.

1807
01:29:47,507 --> 01:29:51,219
It's a tropical paradise. I mean,
the coconuts literally grow on trees here.

1808
01:29:51,303 --> 01:29:52,220
Stop.

1809
01:29:55,765 --> 01:29:57,183
-You don't understand.
-Tell me.

1810
01:29:57,267 --> 01:29:58,810
What don't I understand? Tell me.

1811
01:29:59,352 --> 01:30:00,395
Well, I'm--

1812
01:30:01,271 --> 01:30:04,983
I'm not good at, you know, this.

1813
01:30:05,483 --> 01:30:07,068
-What is this?
-This.

1814
01:30:07,152 --> 01:30:10,155
You know. This. Relationships.

1815
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:12,490
You know, talking about my feelings.

1816
01:30:12,574 --> 01:30:14,743
You want me to come back.
I want to come back.

1817
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:16,578
I can't come back a failure.

1818
01:30:17,704 --> 01:30:19,831
In what world are you a failure?

1819
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:24,127
You need to get it together, okay?

1820
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:26,588
Definitely. Yes. Yes.

1821
01:30:29,591 --> 01:30:33,261
If you can't have a real conversation
with me, you got to talk to someone.

1822
01:30:34,346 --> 01:30:36,181
Yeah, well, who would I talk to?

1823
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:38,850
I don't know. Can you call Henry?

1824
01:30:42,395 --> 01:30:43,855
Just call him, okay?

[woman] Beautiful day today.

1828
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:30,402
-Yeah.
-You going surfing?

1829
01:31:30,985 --> 01:31:33,363
I was thinking about going hiking,
actually.

1830
01:31:33,446 --> 01:31:35,657
Sounds nice. Where are you from?

1831
01:31:38,535 --> 01:31:40,245
Chagrin Falls, Ohio.

01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:18,158
[Henry] No, I'll pass.

1834
01:32:18,241 --> 01:32:22,120
Isn't downhill skiing just a competition

Excuse me.

1837
01:32:27,876 --> 01:32:29,335
[woman] Henry's more of a sailor.

1838
01:32:29,419 --> 01:32:32,255
He's gonna take my daughter
on his boat for her sixth birthday.

1839
01:32:32,338 --> 01:32:33,506
Right, Henry?

1840
01:32:33,590 --> 01:32:34,674
It's tempting.

No, he fell.

-Right.

1844
01:33:02,368 --> 01:33:04,913
-That's not the state he was in.
-Well, I think he jumped.

1845
01:33:04,996 --> 01:33:08,958
No, he got high, and he went too far
like he always does, and he fell.

1846
01:33:09,042 --> 01:33:12,170
He probably fell while he was looking
for a place to jump.

[harmonica playing]

Hi.

1849
01:33:20,762 --> 01:33:22,222
Well, he's in heaven now,

1850
01:33:22,305 --> 01:33:24,766
sticking his dick
in Eleanor Roosevelt's ear.

1851
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:27,060
He was just so young.

1852
01:33:27,143 --> 01:33:28,394
Can't believe he's gone.

1853

How can you eat shrimp
at a time like this?

1854

Yeah.

1855
01:33:37,195 --> 01:33:39,197
We gave them our golden boy,

1856
01:33:40,198 --> 01:33:41,741
and they sent back his body.

1857
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:44,494
You know, the saddest part
of this whole thing

1858
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:49,791
is that he wasn't holding hands
with Chevy when he went off that cliff.

1859
01:33:50,542 --> 01:33:53,461
He was like a son to me. I loved him.
Although, sometimes I wanted...

1860
01:33:53,545 --> 01:33:55,505
-to cut the brakes on his car.
-Mm-hmm.

1861
01:33:55,588 --> 01:33:56,923
You know, without telling him.

1862
01:33:57,465 --> 01:34:00,885
A boxing phenomenon who desperately wants
to work at a brassiere factory.

This is a movie idea?

Yes.

01:34:17,861 --> 01:34:19,153
I'm the older you.

So you're...

1871
01:34:22,949 --> 01:34:25,410
Yeah. A narrative device.

01:34:25,493 --> 01:34:27,036
-It's a choice. Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

Wow, look at this.

01:34:31,082 --> 01:34:33,751
You were beloved
by so many white people.

1875
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:42,176
If it's any consolation, years from now
people really like<i> Caddyshack.</i>

01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,762
They're kind of annoying about it,
actually.

Go ahead. Talk to 'em.

Well, now you have a matched set.

1879
01:35:10,204 --> 01:35:11,664
He was so loved.

01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:18,963
And all these people...

1881
01:35:20,465 --> 01:35:21,674
they all loved him.

[sobs]

Every funny person in the world is here,

You know, he's right.

Come on! Somebody!

Henry...

01:36:00,505 --> 01:36:02,006
I'm sorry about everything.

1890
01:36:04,217 --> 01:36:05,969
I know you accept my apology.

1891
01:36:06,052 --> 01:36:09,597
I mean, you were wrong, too.
We don't have to get into that now.

1892
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:14,978
But this situation absolutely requires

1893
01:36:15,061 --> 01:36:17,480
a really futile and stupid gesture.
