00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,800
产生分裂
to divide.

141
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,600
四个逐渐停止了
Four petered out.

142
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,140
两个储在液体氮气中
Two were stored in liquid nitrogen.

143
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,810
我们让一个成长
And we allowed one to grow.

144
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,810
它的代号是西尔
Its code name is "Sil."

145
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,810
这是两小时后的形态
That's after 2 hours.

146
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,530
- 天
One day.

147
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,480
两天
Two days.

148
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,990
- 天啊  - 这成长过程真惊人
- My God. - This growth is amazing.

149
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,660
- 星期
A week.

150
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:56,500
- 是女孩子  - 对
- It's a girl. - Yes.

151
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,490
我们制造一个雌性 那么她就较温驯
We decided to make it female so it would be more docile...

152
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,710
- 和较易控制  - 温驯和容易受控？
and controllable. - More docile and controllable, huh?

153
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:08,090
你们消息真不灵通
Well, I guess you guys don't get out much.

154
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,890
这是她出生后一个月的状态
That's her 1 month after she was born.

155
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,050
你把她关在那儿？
So you kept her caged in there?

156
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,690
隔离她比较安全
It was safer to keep her isolated.

157
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,010
她不喜欢这样
She didn't like being locked up.

158
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,020
她不喜欢独自一人
She didn't like being alone.

159
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,770
是吗？
Didn't she?

160
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,940
她在隐藏身体里的一些东西
She's hiding something. Something inside.

161
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,030
说得没错
You're right, Dan.

162
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,450
这是她三个月大的情形 留心看
This is three months after she was born. Watch carefully.

163
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,280
那是什么？
What the hell was that?

164
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,950
把录影带转回
Back the tape up.

165
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,790
看她双眼
Watch her eyes.

166
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,800
眼睛急速跳动，她在做梦
Rapid eye movement. She's dreaming.

167
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:58,390
- 可怕的噩梦  - 是焦虑造成的反应
- She's having horrible nightmares. - It's some kind of anxiety reaction.

168
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,180
我也感到忧虑
Got me a little anxious.

169
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,390
也使研究队伍有点担忧
It made the research team a little anxious too...

170
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,980
所以我们决定中止实验
so the decision was made to terminate the experiment...

171
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:10,110
转而研究我们要应付什么
to run more research to see what we were dealing with.

172
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,240
你们打算毒死她？
You were going to gas her?

173
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,450
那就是我们的决定
That was the decision.

174
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,790
那使你很难受
It makes you feel mad.

175
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,870
要杀死她你很难过，对吗？
You feel mad that you had to kill her, don't you?

176
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,420
我不知道
I don't know.

177
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,100
对
Yes.

178
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:45,440
昨天在盐湖城附近的 一辆火车内发现一具尸体
Yesterday the body of a transient was found in a boxcar near Salt Lake City.

179
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,400
初步DNA测试所得的结论是
Preliminary DNA tests conclude...

180
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,820
他是被我们的西尔所杀的
he was killed by our creation, by our Sil.

181
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,530
发现到其他尸体吗？
Found any other bodies?

182
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,230
- 还没  - 晚一点就会
- Not yet. - You will.

183
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,110
她是个掠食者
She's a predator.

184
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,040
她双眼在前面
Her eyes are in front...

185
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:03,200
她能够判断跟猎物的距离
so she can judge the distance to her prey.

186
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,540
对
That's right.

187
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,120
你从哪里学会的？
Where'd you learn that?

188
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,550
探索频道播放的节目
I saw it on the Discovery Channel.

189
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,040
我也有看那节目
I caught that show myself.

190
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,220
- 伦诺斯先生  - 什么事？
- Mr. Lennox. - Yeah?

191
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,850
我们…
As the...

192
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:22,020
都不是科学家 你们明白在发生什么事吗？
non-scientist amongst us, are you clear about what's going on?

193
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,180
明白
I think so.

194
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,810
你得到外太空的一个程式
You created a monster...

195
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,020
以此制造了一个怪物
with a formula you got from outer space.

196
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,320
她逃走了 你想我们追寻和杀死她
The damn thing got away. Now you want us to hunt it down and kill it.

197
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,320
对不对？
Now, is that pretty close?

198
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,240
可以这样说
I guess.

199
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,700
你不想我们
You don't want us...

200
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,990
活捉她和研究她吗？
to capture her alive so that we can study her?

201
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:50,750
这是一次纯寻找 和纯消灭的行动
Laura, I think this is strictly a search and destroy operation.

202
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,460
向我求助的人 都想消灭他们的目标
Nobody ever asked me to find anything they didn't want dead.

203
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,010
我为你难过
I'm sorry for you.

204
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,010
是啊
Yeah, well...

205
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,680
谢谢你
Thank you, Dan.

206
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,180
我替她难过
I'm sorry for her.

207
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,020
请注意
May I have your attention, please?

208
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:14,440
欢迎到洛杉矶来 这是沙漠之星的终站
Welcome to Los Angeles. This is the terminal stop for the Desert Star.

209
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,190
请所有乘客离开
All passengers please disembark.

210
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,500
<font size=28 color=#00d8f8>洛杉矶

211
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,940
有坏事发生了
Something bad happened here.

212
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,110
- 天啊 - 她的喉给压碎了
- No shit. - Crushed her larynx.

213
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,990
她很怕
She was afraid.

214
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,610
她害怕、惊慌
She's scared, frightened.

215
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,700
还很饿，她吃了很多
Hungry too. She's been eating like a horse.

216
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:50,540
她显然不是在节食
Our girl is definitely not on a diet.

217
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,000
她要提早储存能量
She's storing calories for something.

218
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,620
有头绪吗？
Any ideas?

219
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,460
我的天
Oh, my...

220
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,970
那是…
Well, that's...

221
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,470
看起来像是…
That looks like some sort of...

222
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:07,510
蛹，像是茧
chrysalis. Some kind of cocoon.

223
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,140
我们在寻找一只巨型飞峨吗？
What are we looking for, a giant moth?

224
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,560
若那是茧...
If that is a cocoon...

225
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,270
她现在一定已完全成长
She'll be fully-grown now. - Fully-grown.

226
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,940
或许她因此而未被我们发现
Maybe that's how she got by our people.

227
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,770
他们只在寻找一个孩子
They were looking for a child.

228
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,650
她的确是孩子
She is a child.

229
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:27,700
这儿很臭，我出去了
It stinks in here. I'm going outside.

230
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,630
向列车长取身分证 和信用卡号码
Get the conductors' ID and credit card numbers on your computer.

231
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,880
列车内没有它们影踪
There's no sign of them on the train.

232
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:44,010
- 她可能带走了他们 - 交给我办
- Let's assume she took them. - I'll see to that.

233
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,880
她感到受威胁时就会杀人
She kills if she's threatened.

234
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,510
而她是绝无悔意的
And she has no remorse about it. None.

235
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:52,060
洛杉矶绝对适合她
Of course, Los Angeles is perfect for her.

236
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,850
这是一个未来的城市
It's a city of the future.

237
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,260
什么事都有可能
Anything goes.

238
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,230
人口流动性强 大家都是陌生人
Totally mobile population. Everyone's a stranger.

239
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,480
无论她做什么
Very little is taboo or unacceptable.

240
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,690
都不会有人察觉
Whatever she does, no one will notice her.

241
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:05,070
随你怎说 所以…
Well, whatever. So...

242
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,040
洛杉矶将是我们作战的地方
Los Angeles is where the battle will be fought...

243
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,750
我们要胜利
...and won.

244
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,270
你看起来好漂亮
You look very pretty.

245
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,570
有一百块的吗？
Do you have a hundred?

246
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,320
在这
Here we are.

247
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:52,250
小心你的钱 很多人不会像我一样老实
Be more careful with your money. Not everybody's as honest as me.

248
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,750
你从外地来的？
Are you foreign?

249
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,250
会说英语吗？
Do you speak English?

250
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,760
- 会 - 拿着
- Yes. - Here. You keep this.

251
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,340
让我替你拿下来
Here, let me take this.

252
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,880
小心
Be careful here.

253
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,430
我会
Yes.

254
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,180
小心
Watch your step.

255
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,620
我们的实验室 访客基地一号
Our laboratory, Visitor Base One...

256
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:40,290
...正在迁移到大学现在没用的 病毒研究实验室
...is being moved to some empty virus research labs at the university.

257
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:44,000
他们正在搬运仪器 八点就可以运作
They're moving our equipment now. It'll be operational by 8:00.

258
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:47,460
你们先进自己房间 十五分钟后会合
Check into your rooms. Everyone out front in 15 minutes. We'll go over.

259
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,130
我们将做什么？
What will we do?

260
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,640
处理从火车上得来的证据
Process the evidence from the train.

261
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:55,350
我们能用那生物的DNA 繁殖它吗？
Could we try growing this creature with its own DNA?

262
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,690
这次不结合我们的DNA 看看它的脆弱程度
We do a version without ours this time and investigate its vulnerabilities.

263
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,970
主意不错
That'd be good.

264
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,690
- 我也想知道 - 有道理
- Then I could know how it feels. - Makes sense.

265
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,650
这个人类生命形态可能是掩饰
This human life form could be a mask. Without the camouflage...

266
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,820
没错，至少可让我们知道 在对付什么东西
You're right. At least we'd know what we were dealing with.

267
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,540
<font size=28 color=#00d8f8>萨哈拉汽车旅馆

268
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:12,050
刚有两个笨蛋跑掉，我有客人
A couple of bozos just ran out. I got a customer.

269
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,550
- 可以帮你吗？ - 我想要个房间
- Yes, young lady. Can I help you? - I want a room.

270
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:20,600
连税合共六十二元 刚好是蜜月套房的价钱
62, including tax. That'll just about cover the Honeymoon Suite.

271
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,740
你好，你经常来吗？
Hi. Come here often?

272
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,290
你的星座是什么？
What's your sign?

273
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,460
厌倦了褐色的头发？
Tired of brunette?

274
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,390
改变
Change.

275
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,930
改变你头发的颜色
Change the color of your hair.

276
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,480
头发色素
Color-Tress.

277
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,990
我放大倍数
I've increased the magnification.

278
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:22,330
当我刺破细胞 外来的DNA就会加进去
When I pierce the cell, the foreign DNA will be introduced.

279
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,590
岂此有理
Shit!

280
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,010
摄影机坏了
The camera's gone down.

281
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,300
不好意思
Excuse me.

282
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,630
你有另外一部吗？
Do you have a replacement camera?

283
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:45,470
有，不过替换需要些时间
We do, but it'll take time for the technician to replace it.

284
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:49,350
这种事经常在我实验室发生 很简单
No. This happens in my lab all the time. It's simple to replace it.

285
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,270
你会替换？
You saying you can do it?

286
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:54,230
当然，我需要人帮忙
Sure I can. I just need somebody to give me a hand.

287
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:57,650
技师不可以进去，是机密
I don't want technicians in there. This is classified.

288
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,110
我去
I'll do it.

289
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,870
我去
I'll do it.

290
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,000
- 够爽快，我喜欢 - 我就是这样的
- Man of action, I like that. - That's me.

291
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,510
请替我扭开那一边，好吗？
Can you get that one for me?

292
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,820
给我摄影机
Give me the camera.

293
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:58,260
有些不对劲
Something's... Something's wrong.

294
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,010
糟，已经开始了
Christ, It's started already.

295
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,680
- 把盖子盖上 - 什么？
- It's started. Get the top back on. - What?

296
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,970
把盖子盖上
Laura, Press, get the top back on.

297
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,570
给你
Here you go.

298
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,530
她已经把细胞注入了
She must have penetrated the cell.

299
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:20,570
- 他妈的 - 那是什么？
- Shit. - What was that?

300
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,860
他弄掉了螺钉
He dropped the bolt.

301
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:26,530
- 去找螺钉，盖上盖子 - 我正在试
- Find the bolt. Get the top on. - I'm looking, Fitch.

302
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,950
他们听不到吗？
Can they hear me in there?

303
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:31,410
你们快点…
Laura, Press...

304
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,710
- 盖上盖子，我就让你们出来 - 它去哪了？
...get the top on, then I'll let you out. - Where'd it go?

305
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,390
- 它从铁丝网掉下去了 - 你可提起它吗？
- It fell through the grate. - Can you lift it up?

306
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:47,050
- 移不动它 - 它不动
- It's not gonna move. - This isn't going anywhere.

307
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,760
- 提不起来 - 普雷斯顿…
- No, can't get it! - Press...

308
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,770
...找那螺钉！
...you gotta get the bolt!

309
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,810
- 我移不动那铁丝网，它被悍接了 - 天啊
- Can't get it. The floor's welded down. - Oh, my God.

310
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,770
天啊
Press. Oh, my God.

311
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:59,110
- 我从没见过像这样的东西 - 天啊
- I've never seen anything like this. - Holy shit.

312
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,690
不能让他们出来
I can't let them out.

313
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,320
- 看 - 快点
- Press, look. - Come on.

314
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,280
让我们出来！
Fitch, let us out of here!

315
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,360
开门！
Open the goddamn door!

316
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,750
- 我要知道那里面是什么东西！ - 开门
- Not until I know what's in there! - Open it now!

317
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,460
- 让他们出来 - 不行
- Let them out. - I can't!

318
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,920
- 开门 - 让我们出来
- Open up the fucking door! - Let us out!

319
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,970
- 告诉我它会停止生长的 - 不会，放他们出来！
- Tell me it'll stop growing, Dan. - It's not, let them out!

320
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,010
开门！
Open up the door!

321
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,670
普雷斯顿
Press, Press.

322
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,550
这是什么怪物？!
What the fuck is that?!

323
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:32,140
去另一扇门
Laura, get to the other door!

324
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,400
- 放她出来！ - 不可以！
- Let her out, Fitch! - I can't!

325
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:36,440
- 让她走！ - 不可以
- Let her out! - I can't!

326
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,310
- 去你的 - 让她出来
- You motherfucker! - Let her out!

327
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,980
- 你一定要让他们出来 - 我无法按住它
- You've gotta let them out! - I can't hold it in!

328
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,480
走！
Get out of the way!

329
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,650
我要烧掉它！
I'm gonna burn it! Out of the way!

330
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:51,450
- 这是什么东西？ - 两分钟后这房间就会被烧毁
- What is this thing? - In 2 minutes, I'm burning the room!

331
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,830
我必须这么做
I have to do it!

332
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,500
在两分钟内消灭它
You have two minutes to kill it.

333
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,920
截断煤气管，用它来喷火
Disconnect the gas line. Use it as a flamethrower.

334
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,590
小心
Laura, watch out!

335
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,140
- 哪儿？ - 在管子里！
- Where'd it go? - In the pipes!

336
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,850
- 开门！ - 住嘴！
- Open the door! - Shut up, Dan!

337
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:19,360
剩下一分钟
One minute remaining.

338
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,950
罗拉
Laura...

339
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,710
它不动了，我想我杀了它
It stopped moving. I think I killed it.

340
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,750
它死了！开门！
It's dead! Open the door!

341
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,710
让他们出来
It's dead, Fitch. Let them out.

342
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,510
糟，它还没死
Oh, God, it's not dead.

343
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,020
我们怎么办？
- Shit. - What'll we do?

344
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,720
还剩三十秒
30 seconds remaining.

345
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,560
- 时间不多了，快点 - 开门
- There's not much time. Let's go. - Open the door!

346
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,480
- 快让他们出来 - 不行
- Let them out. - I can't do that.

347
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,610
- 我要依循协议书 - 什么协议书？
- I have to follow protocol! - What protocol?!

348
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,610
做这个实验的规则
The protocols by which we're doing this!

349
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:10,490
你并没告诉他们
You didn't tell them that before they went in.

350
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:13,160
- 让他们出来 - 12 , 11 , 10…
- Fitch, let them out. - Twelve, 11, 10...

351
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:15,920
- 让他们出来！ - 我必须跟从协议书
- Fitch, let them out! - I must follow protocol.

352
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,370
让他们出来
Let them out, Fitch!

353
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,910
快出来
Go. Get out of there!

354
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:23,080
3 , 2 , 1
Three, two, one.

355
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,050
- 我没有选择  - 是的，当然
- I had no choice. - Yeah, sure.

356
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:28,630
协议书说若出了状况 就把房间烧毁！
The protocol is to burn the room if anything went wrong!

357
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,450
我可在哪儿找到一个男人？
Where's a good place to find a man?

358
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:55,910
附近有一家夜总会 那儿有许多男人
There's plenty of guys at the Id around the corner. It's a club.

359
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,370
你不会有问题找到男人的
You won't have trouble meeting somebody there.

360
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,530
谢谢你
Thank you.

361
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,160
很容易找到的 有人排队的地方便是了
You can't miss it. Look for the long line.

362
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,460
我需要你的信用卡
I need your credit card...

363
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,340
...以支付你房间杂费 长途电话费等等
...for room incidentals, long distance calls and so forth.

364
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,300
信用卡？让我刷刷
Credit card? Zip zap?

365
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,970
美国运通，诸如此类的？
American Express, Visa, MasterCard?

366
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,890
对了，谢谢
There you go. Thanks. All right.

367
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:17,300
谢谢
Thank you.

368
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,480
等一下！
Wait a minute!

369
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,730
你不会想让这个落在坏人手里
You don't want this falling into the wrong hands.

370
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,400
对
No.

371
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:33,900
克劳尔挥杆，被守门员档着
Here's Justin Crawl. It's through and it's covered by the goalie.

372
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,240
喂？
Yeah?

373
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,200
列车长的信用卡被发现在…
The conductor's credit card turned up...

374
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,040
...好莱坞旅馆，货车正等着
...in a Hollywood motel. The van's out front.

375
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,500
出发吧
Let's go.

376
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,330
你们两个
You two.

377
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,010
慢慢享受
Enjoy yourselves.

378
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,690
长腿姐姐，你被看中了 进去
You, legs. You're in. Go on.

379
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,710
你从哪里来的？
Where are you from?

380
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:26,250
- 我不是本地人  - 什么？
- I'm foreign. - You're what?

381
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,550
- 我不是本地人  - 真的？
- I'm foreign. - Really?

382
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,550
慢慢来
Easy, easy.

383
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,590
我要去派对，但没有男伴
I've got a party to go to and no one to take me.

384
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,180
我可当你的男伴
I'll take you.

385
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,810
- 你会？ - 是的
- You will? - Yeah.

386
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,060
好，我要去洗手间
Okay. I'm going to the little girls' room.

387
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:41,970
在这里等我
Wait right here.

388
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,890
我很快回来
I'll be right back.

389
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,560
我不会走
I'll be right here.

390
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,460
不论付出任何代价？
Whatever it takes, right?

391
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,870
爱情与打仗都是公平的
All's fair in love and war.

392
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:36,610
看不清楚
Can't see much on that.

393
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:39,490
把录影带带回实验室 增强清晰度
Get this tape to the lab. Enhance it.

394
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,650
看看会否看清楚点
See if we can get a better look.

395
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,660
她样子看起来不错
She looks nice.

396
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:46,280
你知道她去哪里吗？
Do you have any idea where she went?

397
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,040
- 我去找她  - 她想去找男人
- I'll find her. - She wanted to meet a man.

398
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:53,000
我提议她到附近一间夜总会
I suggested a club called the Id around the corner.

399
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,340
把录影带带回去
Get the tape.

400
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:18,530
我要去派对，但没有男伴
I've got a party to go to and no one to take me.

401
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,820
在哪儿了？
Where is this party?

402
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,700
不知道
I don't know.

403
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,670
哇,你不能在此停车！
Whoa, you can't park there!

404
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,630
退回去！
Back that out!

405
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:40,510
- 你不可以进去  - 发生什么事？!
- No, you can't go in there. - What's going on?!

406
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:59,200
- 这儿发生谋杀案  - 不准离开！没有人可以离开！
- There's been a murder! - No one leaves here! I mean, nobody!

407
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,370
这地方总是会有各种行动的
There's always some action in this part of town.

408
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,540
蓝眼睛、金发
Blue-eyed blonde.

409
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,720
黑色紧身裤、粉红色毛衣 五尺十寸高，她跟谁走的？
Black leggings, pink sweater, 5' 10" tall. Who'd she leave with?

410
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,550
金发美女跟男人走并非大新闻
Blonde leaves with a guy is hardly news around here.

411
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:28,730
说出最受欢迎的人 不要说出没出，急的人
Name the top attractions. No losers.

412
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:31,270
他会帮她逃走
Assume he's socially adept. He'll be helping her out.

413
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,520
他是好人，并非坏蛋
A friendly guy, not an asshole.

414
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,400
我在想着
I'm thinking.

415
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:38,360
- 罗比跟一个金发女子离开  - 就是他
- Robbie left with a blonde. - That's him.

416
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:40,690
是他
That's him.

417
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,570
让我带你参观这房子
Come on. Let me show you the rest of the house.

418
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:46,580
我在那里弄得满身臭汗
I'm still sweaty from that place.

419
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,250
太挤拥了
It's so crowded.

420
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,800
喜欢吗？
Like it?

421
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,250
喜欢
Yes.

422
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:58,960
我想淋浴
I feel like a shower.

423
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:01,140
你想吗？
You want one?

424
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:03,420
告诉你
Tell you what.

425
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,100
我现在去淋浴
I'm taking one.

426
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:07,020
如果你稍后也想…
You wanna take one later...

427
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:08,680
没有问题
No problem.

428
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,310
脱去衣服
Take off your clothes.

429
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,640
我想看一看
I want to see you.

430
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,660
好美
Very nice.

431
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,580
送我回去好吗？
Take me back.

432
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,710
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

433
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:22,710
你知道为何我们要来这
You know why we came here.

434
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:24,680
我改变主意了
I've changed my mind.

435
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:27,300
你说不
All right. You said "no."

436
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:30,180
我听到了，过来
It's duly noted. Come here.

437
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:31,380
我想离开！
I wanna go!

438
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,650
太迟了，你休想离开！
Too late. You're not leaving! You're not!

439
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:40,310
- 好吧  - 这才像样
- All right. - That's better.

440
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:12,820
什么回事？在夜总会杀掉女子 又杀掉这家伙
What's happening? Kills a girl at the club, kills this guy.

441
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,080
她像是精神病患者
I'd say she fits the definition of a psychopath.

442
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:18,120
没什么会抑制她
Nothing inhibits her.

443
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:21,040
没道德观念，没社会结构
No moral sense, no social structure.

444
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,420
她并非沉溺在母爱之中
She wasn't exactly smothered with a mother's love or taught good manners.

445
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,380
究竟发生了什么事
I asked what was happening.

446
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:29,750
他做了一些事使她生气
He did something, she was angry.

447
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:32,930
若她感到受威胁或有人阻碍她 她就会杀死对方
She'll kill if she's threatened or if anyone gets in her way.

448
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:34,350
阻碍她什么？
Of what?

449
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,800
她的生命周期
Her life cycle.

450
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,140
她似乎想交配
I think she's trying to mate.

451
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,600
进行繁殖
Reproduce.

452
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,140
好
Okay.

453
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,100
为何她要杀那女子？
So why did she kill the girl?

454
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,110
性竞争
Sexual competition.

455
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,860
她不会在竞争上屈服
She's hard on the competition.

456
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,480
她想交配
Now she managed to mate.

457
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,780
似乎不成功，他仍穿着裤子
Doesn't look like a success. He's still got his pants on.

458
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,280
- 她很沮丧  - 谁不会？
- She's frustrated. - Who isn't?

459
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,110
她有什么问题？是她跟他来的
What's her problem? She was here with him.

460
00:45:58,330 --> 00:45:59,950
或许她拒绝他
Maybe she rejected him.

461
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:02,080
她大概有特别感官
She probably has special senses.

462
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:06,540
老鼠能够感应配偶 是否有病或基因不健全的
Rats can sense diseased or genetic damage in their potential mates...

463
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,220
...所以我们可以测试他
...so we can test his body...

464
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:13,010
...检查他有没有遗传病或缺憾 让他不能做她的...
...for hereditary diseases or defects that would make him a loser...

465
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,510
...配偶
...essentially.

466
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:16,010
是注射针
Needles.

467
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:19,770
也许他是瘾君子 或是糖尿病人
Maybe he was a doper, or a diabetic.

468
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,860
两者都不能够接受 对不起
Either way would make him unacceptable. Excuse me.

469
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:26,180
是了
All right.

470
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:30,690
胰岛素，他是糖尿病患者
Insulin. Diabetic. There you have it.

471
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:33,570
她可以离开的 为何要杀死他？
She could have just walked out. Why kill him?

472
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:35,900
他让她生气
He pissed her off.

473
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,580
有些家伙被拒绝了 也死缠烂打的
Some men, when rejected, get insistent.

474
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:41,410
- 追踪他的汽车  - 已发了通报
- Put an APB out on his car. - We have.

475
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:44,620
我们要返回旅馆 我要查个水落石出
We'll go back to the motel. I want to check it out.

476
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,880
还说比较温驯和易受控制？
More docile and controllable, huh, Fitch?

477
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,980
- 你认为怎样？ - 我认为怎样？
- What do you think, Dan? - What do I think?

478
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:08,560
我想她现在想独自一人
I think she'd want to be alone now.

479
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,560
这么多辆车停在外面 她是不会来的
She won't come here with all these cars outside.

480
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:15,730
你指她自有方法回来？
You're assuming she could find her way back here.

481
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:17,150
有可能
She could.

482
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:18,990
这是什么？
What is it?

483
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,540
也许是经血
Maybe menstrual blood.

484
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:26,080
如果她有经期 即是她可以繁殖
If she's menstruating, she can reproduce.

485
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,540
对，我知道
Yes, I know.

486
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:05,680
糟糕
Shit.

487
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:12,680
天
Oh, Jesus.

488
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,140
请让开
Excuse me.

489
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:17,860
快叫救护车来 谁人有电话？
Call a paramedic! Anybody got a phone?

490
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:26,280
十号公路向西行的交通
If your commute takes you westbound on the 10 freeway...

491
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,040
...将有一小时的延误
...expect an hour delay.

492
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:30,660
往．马里布的车程将会缓慢
The drive will be slow to Malibu.

493
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,040
<font size=28 color=#00d8f8>只限无铅汽油

494
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,130
录影带的清晰度仍不理想
The video enhancement is not that great.

495
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:42,510
你猜她多大？ 二十岁？二十三岁？
How old do you think she is? Twenty, 23?

496
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:46,970
她的生殖系统应该完全成熟
Her reproductive system should be fully developed.

497
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:49,220
她的生理时钟必定很亢奋
Her biological clock must be in hyperdrive.

498
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,390
她想要孩子
She wants a baby.

499
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:53,310
若她有孩子，我们就有麻烦
If she has a child our problems have just begun.

500
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:56,610
若她怀着的是个男孩 而他的成长速度如西尔一样
If her offspring is male and develops at the same rate as Sil...

501
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:00,450
...六个月后就有能力繁殖了
...it could reproduce in 6 months.

502
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,280
天晓得他能使多少个女性怀孕

503
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:05,950
菲奇
Fitch.

504
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,580
当一个掠食性品种来到

505
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,410
...一个封闭的生态系统

506
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:15,670
...较弱的品种就会灭绝

507
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,580
他们在圣莫尼卡 找到已没汽油的宝．马

509
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,420
- 我不知道  - 你是谁？
- I don't know. - Who are you?

510
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,720
她没有身分证 我想确定她没大碍
She didn't have any ID. I thought I'd make sure she was okay.

511
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,720
她有医疗保险吗？
You think she's got insurance?

512
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:32,480
我不知道 算在我信用卡的帐上吧
I don't know. Just put it on my credit card for now.

513
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:36,650
但你连她的名字也不知道 像你这样的人真难得
And you don't know her name. Guys like you are hard to find.

514
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:46,490
让实验室做个实验

给她照X光片，要照这里
Get her up to x-ray. I want an x-ray on this.

516

It looks like a scapula fracture.

517

你的肩膀
Your shoulder wound.

518
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:10,980
怎会这样的？
What's going on here?

这真是奇迹
You are. It's a miracle.

528
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:46,340
可以离开了吗？
Can we go?

529
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:49,300
医生说你可以离开吗？
Did the doctor say you could go?

530
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,720
是
Yes.

远离车辆、人和事

看着摄影机

552
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,890
谁帮她挂号的？
Who checked her in?

553
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,010
然我们看看
I don't know. Let's find out.

554
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:20,640
她没有保险 所以他用信用卡帮她付了帐
She had no insurance so this guy put it on his own credit card.

555
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:24,900
是这个档案，他叫约翰凯瑞
Here's the file. John F. Carey.

556
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:29,780
有驾．驶执照或地址的资料吗？
You don't have a driver's license or home address?

557
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:33,490
没有 只有他的信用卡刷卡纪录
No, sir. Just an imprint of his credit card.

558
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,530
给我们印一张你有的资料
Give us a printout of what you've got.

559
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:38,080
没问题
No problem.

560
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:42,540
吃糖吗？
Some candy?

561
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,800
在帕利塞德 还有他的电话号码
It's in the Palisades and he's got a phone number.

562
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,520
告诉菲奇我们的目的地 试着打电话给约翰凯瑞
Tell Fitch where we're headed, and try to get John Carey on the line.

563
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:31,380
让我去接
I'd better get the phone.

564
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:41,050
答录机响了，应该留话吗？
I've got his machine. Should I leave a message?

565
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:42,560
好
Yeah.

566
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:46,190
告诉他他将要跟 外太空生物交配
Tell him he's about to copulate with a creature from outer space.

567
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,060
- 交配？ - 对
- Copulate, huh? - Yeah.

568
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:51,940
我喜欢你
I like you.

569
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,440
我知道
I know.

570
00:54:58,370 --> 00:55:00,610
我们在一起也不会太快
It's not too soon for us to be together.

571
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:03,960
对，不会太快
No, it's not too soon.

572
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,450
你不用穿裤子
You don't need these.

573
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,920
你太急了
Hey, hey. That's a little fast.

574
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,650
怎么了？
What's the matter?

575
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:26,570
慢慢来
Take it easy.

576
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,890
放松点
Just relax.

577
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:33,910
还有许多时间
There's plenty of time.

578
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:43,910
什么事？
What is it?

579
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:48,620
有人在门外
I think someone's at the door.

580
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,040
别走
Don't go.

581
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,880
求求你 我想要孩子
Please. I want a baby.

582
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:55,420
什么？! 对不起？
What?! Excuse me?

583
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:07,440
从旁边去看看
Let's go around the side.

584
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:51,980
外面
Outside.

585
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:52,600
- 什么事？ - 是松鼠！该死的松鼠！
- What happened?  - A squirrel! A fucking squirrel!

586
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:55,270
- 她曾在这儿 - 没错
- She was here. - Yeah, she was.

587
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,650
我想确定她离开了
I wanna make sure she's not still here.

588
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:28,050
应检查尸体 有没有曾性交过的迹象
Perhaps we should check the body for evidence that they've had sex.

589
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,820
血淋淋的情景叫我害怕
I used to be scared at the sight of blood.

590
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:40,480
我已习惯了
Now I guess I'm getting used to it.

591
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:43,230
对啊
Oh, yes.

592
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:11,800
- 救我！ - 什么事？
- Help me, please! - Oh, my God. What's the matter?

593
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:14,640
我们在客厅发现的
We found this in the living room.

594
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:17,810
她喜欢他
She liked him.

595
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:21,360
不够清楚
Well, not enough.

596
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:25,150
跟录像监测所拍出来的差不多
Can't see any more on that than we did on the video monitor.

597
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:27,620
他没有帮她拍到一张好相片
He didn't get a good picture of her.

598
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:30,870
水里没发现精液
There's no evidence of semen in the hot tub water.

599
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:32,870
也许她带走了
Maybe she took it with.

600
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,200
那么她没有交配
So she probably hasn't managed to mate.

601
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:38,500
- 我们打扰了她  - 是的，应该是
- We interrupted her. - Yes, I think we did.

602
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:40,700
给我些我可以用的
Give me something I can use.

603
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,040
你最近想到了什么？
What have you come up with lately, Fitch?

604
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,210
她不怕我们
She's not scared of us.

605
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:52,880
这是肯定的
That's for sure.

606
01:00:56,770 --> 01:00:58,260
我们被难倒了
We're all beat.

607
01:00:58,610 --> 01:01:00,470
先回旅馆休，急一下
We'll go back to the hotel and rest.

608
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,940
明晚
Tomorrow night...

609
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,060
...我们再回到夜总会
...we'll go back to the club.

610
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,900
- 进行监视  - 进行监视
- Stake it out. - Stake it out.

611
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,240
她并不蠢
She's not stupid.

612
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:13,950
她不会重蹈覆辙
She won't repeat herself.

613
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:17,410
没理由再去那里 那儿提供了个坏榜样
There's no point going there. It provided a poor specimen.

614
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:18,620
很难说
I'm not sure.

615
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:21,580
她只来了两天，只知道那地方
She's been in the city two days. It's what she knows.

616
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,460
我宁愿再到夜总会看看
I'd rather try the club...

617
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:28,090
..不要只坐在指挥中心 回忆着我们多接近成功
...than sit at the command center reminiscing about how close we got.

618
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:44,270
她可会是厉害的生物武器
She would make one excellent biological weapon.

619
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:48,450
若有人认为我们是 散布宇宙间的…
If someone thought we were some kind of galactic weed that would...

620
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:50,650
...银河系废物
...spread through the universe.

621
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:53,990
你的意思是...
So what you're saying is that...

622
01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:56,620
...她是疗药，而我们是病源
...she's the cure and we're the disease.

623
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:58,620
说得好
That's well said.

624
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:01,250
罗拉贝克
"Baker, Laura.

625
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:05,170
加州锡米谷 米德大道1735号
1735 Meander Drive, Simi v alley, california."

626
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:06,790
是你吗？
That's you, right?

627
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:09,290
我上次查的资料是这样的
Last time I checked.

628
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,680
你在这做什么？
What do you do for kicks out there?

629
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:15,930
怀念像你这样的家伙
Pine for guys like you.

630
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:18,310
我正这样想
That's what I thought.

631
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:40,570
你们饿吗？
So anyone hungry?

632
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:45,000
不，我很疲倦，我想去休息
No, thanks. I'm beat. I'm gonna try to get some sleep.

633
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:47,420
- 晚安  - 晚安
- Good night. - Yeah. Night.

634
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,880
- 我可以跟你一起吃  - 谢了
- I'll have something to eat with you. - Thanks, Dan.

635
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:56,990
- 你做过噩梦吗？ - 做过
- Do you ever have nightmares? - Yes.

636
01:03:57,790 --> 01:03:59,900
请松绑我的双手
Please untie my hands.

637
01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:03,120
- 我不会伤害你的  - 我做了噩梦
- I wouldn't hurt you. Please. - I have them.

638
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:08,170
噩梦想告诉我我是谁
I think they tell me who I am.

639
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,750
你为何要这样做？
Why are you doing this to me?

640
01:04:13,470 --> 01:04:15,260
我不知道为何我在这里
I don't know why I'm here.

641
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:17,930
我不知道我是谁，谁派我来
I don't know who I am, who sent me.

642
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:21,760
- 你知道吗？ - 不！
- Do you? - No!

643
01:04:25,270 --> 01:04:28,270
- 你为何在此？ - 我不知道
- Why do you think you're here? - I don't know.

644
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,890
请放过我
Please let me go.

645
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:33,480
求求你，让我走
Please. Please, let me go.

646
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:37,780
我不会伤害你
I wouldn't hurt you.

647
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,700
我保证
I promise.

648
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:42,030
- 我不会伤害你的  - 你会的
- I wouldn't hurt you. - Yes, you would.

649
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,370
只是你还不知道
You just don't know it yet.

650
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:47,620
我不会！
No, I wouldn't!

651
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,210
求求你！
Please!

652
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,210
我双手很疼
My hands are hurting me.

653
01:04:57,470 --> 01:04:58,800
谢谢你
Thank you.

654
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,960
谢谢你
Thank you.

655
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,180
我的天！
Oh, my God!

656
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:26,910
不！
Oh, my God, no!

657
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:30,630
天，不！
No! No!

658
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:39,320
<font size=28 color=#00d8f8>危险，高电压

659
01:07:29,710 --> 01:07:31,700
罗拉和普雷斯顿喜欢对方
Laura and Press, they like each other.

660
01:07:32,130 --> 01:07:33,990
他们不流露自己的感受
They just don't like to show how they feel.

661
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:35,540
什么？
What?

662
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,960
罗拉和普雷斯顿 喜欢对方
Laura and Press, they like each other.

663
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:41,080
随你怎说吧，丹
Yeah, whatever you say, Dan.

664
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:44,470
这儿烟雾弥漫，我打算出去
Look, it's really smoky in here. I'm gonna go outside, get some air.

665
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:49,010
在货车上歇一歇 这简直是浪费时间
Think I'll lie down in the van. Have a rest. This is a complete waste of time.

666
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:53,720
感觉上像是在浪费时间吗？
Get a feeling you're on a wild goose chase?

667
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:55,310
对
Yeah.

668
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:57,690
请让开
Excuse me.

669
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:01,210
滚出去，这是我的地盘
Get out of here. This is my trashcan.

670
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:13,720
是你
It's you.

671
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:22,060
喂
Hey!

672
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:25,030
她在这儿
She's here! Hey!

673
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:33,240
-是她吗？ -是
- Dan. Is that her? - Yeah.

674
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:34,620
这儿
Here.

675
01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:42,670
上车
Get in the van.

676
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:46,550
上车！
Everybody get in the van!

677
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:58,100
他们朝山区走 我们需要直升机
They're heading into the hills. We'll need the helicopters.

678
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:14,150
我们要上尼科斯峡谷 在茂贺兰拦截她
We're going up Nichols canyon. One of you try to block her at Mulholland.

679
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:32,630
小心
Watch it!

680
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,910
我的天！
Oh, my God!

681
01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:14,770
已封锁道路 我们一定得告诉报界些消息
We blocked the road. We've gotta tell the press something.

682
01:12:14,990 --> 01:12:17,860
随便你怎么告诉他们 但别说出事实
Tell them what you want, just don't tell them the truth.

683
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:21,320
我不认为她会在夜总会出现 那太简单了
I don't buy her showing up at the club. It's too damn convenient.

684
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:24,370
眼见为实 你不相信你双眼吗？
Seeing is believing or don't you trust your eyes?

685
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:26,750
回去！叫这些人统统回去！
Get back! Get all these people back!

686
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
有些不对
Fitch. Fitch. It doesn't feel right.

687
01:12:30,340 --> 01:12:31,580
长官！
Sir!

688
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:35,470
我们在其中一道车门 发现一只断指
We found a severed thumb in one of the doors that got ripped off.

689
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:38,890
- 让我看看  - 她或许给夹在门中
- Let me see that. - She may have caught it in the door.

690
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:41,090
拿去实验室，看看是否属于她
Get to the lab, see if it's hers.

691
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:44,560
- 可从基因上辨别出来  - 这件事完了
- It'll be genetically identifiable. - It's all over, everyone.

692
01:12:44,730 --> 01:12:47,060
明天你可重过自己的生活
Tomorrow you can go back to your lives.

693
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,610
恭喜你们，做得好
Congratulations on a job well done.

694
01:12:53,110 --> 01:12:55,110
就这样结束了？
Just like that, huh, Fitch?

695
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:57,270
我不认为
I don't think so.

696
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,620
留话给我 法兰克，我会和你吃晚餮
Leave me a message. And Frank, I'm going to dinner.

697
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,460
我们在哪见面？再见
Where are we meeting? Bye, sweetie.

698
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:18,340
服务生
Waiter.

699
01:13:19,850 --> 01:13:21,310
我猜我们赢了
Well, I guess we won.

700
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:26,680
- 我们赢了，科学输了  - 我不认为我们会这样赢
- We won, science lost. - I didn't think we'd get her this way.

701
01:13:27,650 --> 01:13:29,760
- 没那么容易  - 你会怀念她吗？
- Not that easy. - You sound like you'll miss her.

702
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:31,100
会的
I guess I will.

703
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:33,690
我想我尊重她
I think I respected her.

704
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:40,490
这的确是不好做的工作 但我很高兴跟你们三人合作
I know this was a hellish job, but I really enjoyed working with you three.

705
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:43,790
既然国税局请客 让我们再多喝一杯
And since Uncle Sam is buying, let's have another round.

706
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:44,950
服务生！
Waiter!

707
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,990
我不喝酒的
I don't... I don't drink.

708
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:48,950
今晚你会的
Don't worry, Dan. Tonight you will.

709
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:52,500
想跳舞吗？
You wanna dance?

710
01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:54,790
- 谁？我？ - 没错
- Who, me? - Yeah, you.

711
01:13:57,970 --> 01:14:00,130
- 好  - 对啊
- All right. - Okay.

712
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:20,820
我知道你没家室 在纽约有女朋友吗？
I know you don't have a family. Do you have a girlfriend in New York?

713
01:14:21,870 --> 01:14:25,330
曾经有几个，不过都不久
I guess I've had a few, but they don't hang around very long.

714
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:28,330
可能我有太多秘密
I guess I keep too many secrets.

715
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,370
跟我分享一个
You wanna share one with me?

716
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:32,700
- 现在？ - 对
- Right now? - Yeah.

717
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:41,630
我知道你是做什么的 吓不到我的
I know what you do, and it doesn't scare me.

718
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:44,050
- 真的？ - 真的
- Really? - No.

719
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,260
但却使许多人害怕
Well, it does most people.

720
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:53,350
我还要再见你
I wouldn't wanna never see you again.

721
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:01,900
- 喂  - 你在...?
- Hey. - What are you...?

722
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:05,990
对不起 我认错人
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I thought you were somebody else.

723
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,570
对不起
I'm sorry.

724
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:10,740
没事吗？
You okay?

725
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:13,530
我以为是西尔 我见到一头金发
I thought it was Sil. I saw the blonde hair.

726
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:15,240
她死了
She's dead, Press.

727
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:17,960
拇指的化验，证明是她的
The tests on the thumb proved it was her.

728
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:21,380
你相信化验，而我则有胆识 我不相信
You got your test and I got my gut. I just don't buy it.

729
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:26,090
只要你还感到她存在 你都不会放弃
I think as long as you feel she's out there, you got a mission.

730
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:28,760
或者你不想结束这任务
Maybe you don't want this job to be over.

731
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,680
或者是，那又如何？
Well, maybe not. So what?

732
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:36,770
谢谢你那支舞
Thanks for the dance.

733
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:52,460
晚安
Good night.

734
01:15:59,510 --> 01:16:00,750
这是什么？
What do you call this?

735
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,300
长岛冰茶
It's called a Long Island Ice Tea.

736
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:05,930
有茶的成分吗？
It's got tea in it?

737
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:08,140
没有
Nope.

738
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:27,610
很香，我可以试试吗？
Smells nice, can I try some?

739
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:29,940
请便
Help yourself.

740
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:36,960
这会迷倒你男朋友吗？
Does it work on your boyfriend?

741
01:16:37,170 --> 01:16:39,130
令他厌恶
Yeah. As a repellent.

742
01:16:43,010 --> 01:16:46,470
他这个年纪 身型还保持得很好
I don't know. I think he's in remarkably good shape for a man his age.

743
01:16:58,150 --> 01:17:00,230
一杯长岛冰茶
One Long Island Ice Tea.

744
01:17:02,490 --> 01:17:04,730
我喜欢这些茶
I like these cups of tea.

745
01:17:07,030 --> 01:17:09,030
- 什么？ - 太好了
- What? - That's great.

746
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,910
嘿，给我一杯
Hey, give me one of those.

747
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:20,370
我喜欢这些茶
I like these cups of tea, man.

748
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:23,540
我很累，我要去睡了
You guys, I'm tired. I'm gonna go to bed.

749
01:17:26,890 --> 01:17:28,090
那又怎样？
So?

750
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:31,050
她说要上床睡觉
She's going to bed.

751
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:32,600
没错
I guess.

752
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:36,260
但她仍然...
She still...

753
01:17:37,230 --> 01:17:39,020
...想见你
...wants to see you though.

754
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:45,230
我去看看你的话是否正确
Maybe I'll go find out if you're right about that.

755
01:18:11,350 --> 01:18:13,510
地震时我不想在这里
I'd hate to be in here during an earthquake.

756
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:15,020
没错
Yeah.

757
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,020
你到哪一层？
What floor do you want?

758
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:19,100
十楼，麻烦你
Ten, please.

759
01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:31,030
我喜欢你的香水
I like your perfume.

760
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:32,830
是吗？
You do?

761
01:18:33,450 --> 01:18:36,700
- 谢谢  - 对不起，我要出去
- Thank you. - Excuse me. I get out here.

762
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,120
晚安
Good night.

763
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:21,120
- 你好 - 你好

764
01:19:30,510 --> 01:19:32,250
<font size=28 color=#00d8f8>请勿打扰

765
01:19:38,770 --> 01:19:40,350
你想要什么吗？
Did you want something?

766
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:43,760
- 也许 - 也许？
- Maybe. - Maybe?

767

丹
Dan. Dan.

769
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:38,700
我猜那两个女子 会喜欢像我们这样不平凡的男人
Those two over there. Bet they like unusual men like us.

770
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:41,900
女人觉得我很奇怪
Women think I'm strange.

771
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:43,780
我有点不舒服
I don't feel well.

772
01:20:44,290 --> 01:20:45,870
别说傻话
Don't be silly.

773
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:48,460
过去跟她们聊天
Just go over there and talk to them.

774
01:20:48,710 --> 01:20:51,880
我要走了 我觉得你该跟我一起走，好吗？
I have to go. And I think you should leave with me, okay?

775
01:20:54,430 --> 01:20:56,840
我想多留一会
I'm gonna stay for a while, actually.

776
01:20:59,430 --> 01:21:00,640
好吧
Okay.

777
01:21:01,730 --> 01:21:03,140
明天见

打扫房间

779
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:23,820
- 你好 - 你好
- Hi. - Hi.

780
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,410
我在那边坐着，我在猜…
I was sitting over there, wondering...

781
01:21:26,630 --> 01:21:30,170
...这两位聪明漂亮的女子 怎么没有男伴
...what two intelligent, glamorous women were doing without dates.

782
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:31,920
我叫史蒂文阿登
My name's Stephen Arden.

783
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:34,250
在哈佛教授人类学的

784
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:36,080
- 我曾住在波士顿  - 是吗？
- I lived in Boston once. - Yeah?

785
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:37,510
一年
For a year.

786
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:40,590
- 冷得要命  - 的确很冷
- Froze my butt off. - It's cold in Boston.

787
01:21:40,810 --> 01:21:43,220
他们是比尔和东尼 我忘了你的名字
This is Bill and Tony. I forget your name.

788
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:50,430
有趣的袜子
Cute little socks.

789
01:21:52,150 --> 01:21:53,610
起来
Stand up.

790
01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:35,150
你怎么能进来的？
How'd you get in here?

791
01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:37,690
- 偷了钥匙  - 什么？
- I stole the key. - What?

792
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:40,990
我在楼下见到你
I saw you downstairs, but you were with all those people.

793
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:43,530
所以我就上来等你
So I thought I'd come up and wait.

794
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:49,500
这种事不经常发生在我身上
This kind of thing doesn't usually happen to me.

795
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:52,870
我想跟你一起
I just want to be with you.

796
01:23:03,470 --> 01:23:05,060
太好了
Oh, yes.

797
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:20,770
不用做安全措施吗？
What about protection?

798
01:24:16,170 --> 01:24:18,160
她在这儿
She's here. She's here.

799
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:48,660
普雷斯顿
Press?

800
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,700
有人在门外
Someone's at the door.

801
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:53,740
是谁？
Who's there?

802
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,120
普雷斯顿，罗拉
Press, Laura.

803
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:57,330
是丹，我有事告诉你
It's Dan. I gotta talk to you.

804
01:24:57,710 --> 01:25:00,170
他到底想怎样？
Christ, what does he want?

805
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:12,970
- 什么事？ - 我有不祥预感
- What's the problem, Dan? - I just got this terrible feeling.

806
01:25:13,190 --> 01:25:16,300
我奇怪地想到 西尔跟阿登一起的影像
I get this strange thought, this image of Sil with Arden.

807
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:17,930
西尔跟阿登
Sil's next door with Arden, Press.

808
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:20,640
不可能，她已死了
No, no, no. She's dead, Dan.

809
01:25:21,030 --> 01:25:24,690
我经过他房间 听到里面有另外一人
I went to his room and there's someone in there with him.

810
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:28,400
- 你有敲门吗？ - 有，但我不知道她会做什么
- Did you knock on the door? - Yes, but I don't know what she'll do.

811
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:32,450
他们很吵，他们在做爱
They're making a lot of noise. They're having sex.

812
01:25:32,660 --> 01:25:34,830
我知道是西尔
I know it's Sil, I know it!

813
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:36,530
好吧
Okay.

814
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:39,080
我相信你，我去穿衣
I believe you. I'll get dressed.

815
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:56,770
你使我欲仙欲死
I enjoyed that immensely.

816
01:26:15,290 --> 01:26:17,910
- 我感觉到了 - 什么？
- I felt it. - What?

817
01:26:21,460 --> 01:26:22,750
开始了
It's started.

818
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,370
什么？
What's started?

819
01:26:25,550 --> 01:26:26,590
生命
Life.

820
01:26:27,890 --> 01:26:29,920
你真可爱
Oh, my darling girl.

821
01:26:30,470 --> 01:26:34,640
在某些文化里，女人相信 她们知道自己何时怀孕
In some cultures, women believe they know the moment of conception...

822
01:26:34,850 --> 01:26:36,510
你不相信我？感觉一下
Don't you believe me? Feel.

823
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,610
天啊！
Holy shit!

824
01:26:49,530 --> 01:26:51,520
希望你说得对
I hope you're right about this, Dan.

825
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:06,290
- 她朝地下室去了  - 我们走楼梯
- She's headed for the basement. - We'll take the stairs.

826
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:07,880
罗拉，跟我来！
Laura, come with me!

827
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:09,300
来！
Come on!

828
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:16,430
如果她怀孕了 我们必须在她生产前找到她
If she's pregnant, we gotta get to her before she gives birth.

829
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:19,510
我们不知道我们在跟什么周旋
God. We don't know what we're dealing with here.

830
01:27:19,690 --> 01:27:23,560
她可以生一打孩子 甚至可产一千个卵
She could have a dozen babies. She could lay 1000 eggs!

831
01:27:23,730 --> 01:27:27,070
有见到阿登吗？
Oh, God. Did you see Arden?

832
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:28,990
有，那个可怜的家伙
Yeah, I did, that poor bastard.

833
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:33,820
我们可以困住她 防火门在底层出口打开了
We can trap her. The fire door opens from the inside at the bottom exit.

834
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:35,110
然后怎样？
Then what?

835
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:38,740
他妈的
Holy shit.

836
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:42,030
- 哦，上帝  - 那婊子穿过了钢门
- Oh, my God. - The bitch went through a steel door!

837
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:45,160
菲奇！丹！我们在停车场！ 她溜掉了！
Fitch! Dan! We're in the garage! She got past us!

838
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:59,100
- 你见到她？ - 她在我们到达前已离开
- You saw her? - She was gone before we got here.

839
01:27:59,270 --> 01:28:00,980
- 来  - 你见到她！
- Here. - You saw her!

840
01:28:01,190 --> 01:28:03,180
- 看看那扇门！ - 她去哪儿了？
- Look at the door! - Which way did she go?

841
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:05,760
- 普雷斯顿呢？ - 到了隧道下面！
- Where's Press? - He took off down that tunnel.

842
01:28:20,790 --> 01:28:26,300
她感到受威胁时就会杀人
She kills if she feels threatened. She kills if she feels threatened.

843
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:50,400
她一定曾经过这儿
She must've come through here.

844
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,920
她曾下来这里
She went down here. There's no other way.

845
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:16,550
对，她曾在这下面
Yeah, she's down there.

846
01:29:17,810 --> 01:29:19,050
走吧
Let's go.

847
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:21,890
退后，我去清除一下
Stand back, I'll clear it out.

848
01:30:15,110 --> 01:30:17,270
她朝哪个方向，丹？
Which way did she go, Dan?

849
01:30:18,530 --> 01:30:20,440
- 我不知道  - 什么？
- I don't know. - What?

850
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:22,660
我不确定
I'm not sure. She's here.

851
01:30:22,870 --> 01:30:27,790
想一想！你是有超感官的能力！ 那个方向？
Think. You're supposed to have some extrasensory power! Which way?

852
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:32,830
- 她去了哪个方向？ - 我不知道！
- Which way did she go, Dan? - I don't know! I don't know!

853
01:30:36,010 --> 01:30:38,840
- 那边  - 这已经足够了
- I think she went that way. - That's good enough for me.

854
01:30:39,010 --> 01:30:40,840
你认为她往那边走？
You think she went that way?

855
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:44,850
你什么也不知道的，不是吗？
You don't fucking know, don't you? You don't fucking know.

856
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:47,430
我往这边走，跟我来
I'll go this way. You come with me.

857
01:30:47,650 --> 01:30:49,760
- 丹，跟我来！ - 菲奇
- Come with me, Dan! - Fitch.

858
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,260
我认为她往这边走了
I think she went this way.

859
01:31:11,130 --> 01:31:12,490
丹？
Dan?

860
01:31:16,050 --> 01:31:17,380
丹？
Dan?

861
01:31:54,630 --> 01:31:55,870
菲奇
Fitch. Fitch.

862
01:31:57,420 --> 01:31:58,830
丹？
Dan?

863
01:32:01,470 --> 01:32:02,830
怎么了？
What happened?

864
01:32:12,110 --> 01:32:13,440
我可以感觉到她
I can feel her.

865
01:32:14,110 --> 01:32:15,440
她在那一边
She's that way.

866
01:32:16,190 --> 01:32:17,770
她在那一边
She's that way.

867
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:24,440
我从没想过要杀人的
I never thought I'd want to kill something.

868
01:32:24,830 --> 01:32:26,490
我也没想过
Never thought I'd want to.

869
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:04,900
是这边 在这里后面
It's this way. It's back here.

870
01:33:36,060 --> 01:33:38,270
她在里面
Hey, she went in here.

871
01:33:43,530 --> 01:33:45,940
这是在地震时给震开的
This must have opened up during the earthquake.

872
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,020
你们退后
Okay, stand back.

873
01:35:05,070 --> 01:35:06,280
是油吗？
Is that oil?

874
01:35:06,570 --> 01:35:07,900
好像是
Looks like it.

875
01:35:15,580 --> 01:35:18,790
我回去看看能否把她冲出来
I'm going back there to see if I can flush her out.

876
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:21,790
若她穿过这儿回来，便攻击她
If she comes back through here, let her have it.

877
01:35:37,060 --> 01:35:38,970
丹
Dan. Dan!

878
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:41,870
- 那是什么？ - 我不知道
- Dan, what is it?  - I don't know.

879
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:43,370
不知道
I don't know.

880
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:45,390
丹
Dan.

881
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:08,460
没事
Okay.

882
01:38:10,380 --> 01:38:11,670
没事的
It's okay.

883
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:14,580
没有人会伤害你
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

884
01:38:15,430 --> 01:38:16,670
过来
You come here.

885
01:38:18,970 --> 01:38:20,960
过来，我扶你
Come on. I got you.

886
01:38:26,020 --> 01:38:28,350
丹出事了！
Press, something's happened to Dan!

887
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:30,810
没事吗？
You okay?

888
01:38:33,740 --> 01:38:35,070
糟糕
Shit!

889
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,690
丹？
Dan?

890
01:38:39,700 --> 01:38:41,360
丹？
Dan?

891
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:43,530
我被困了！
I'm stuck!

892
01:38:48,580 --> 01:38:51,170
帮帮我！我被困住了！
I need your help! I'm stuck!

893
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:22,190
丹，撑着点！
Dan, you gotta hang on!

894
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:31,120
普雷斯顿
Press!

895
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:36,500
撑着点，丹
Dan, keep on.

896
01:39:50,650 --> 01:39:53,230
普雷斯顿
Press!

897
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:44,400
撑着点！
Hang on, Dan!

898
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:47,950
撑着点
Hang on!

899
01:40:49,330 --> 01:40:50,320
我抓住你了
I got you.

900
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:54,070
我抓住你了
I got you, Dan. Hang on.

901
01:40:54,790 --> 01:40:56,160
糟糕
Shit.

902
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:05,250
撑着点
Hang on!

903
01:41:07,310 --> 01:41:08,470
丹，撑着点
Hang on, Dan!

904
01:41:12,770 --> 01:41:14,680
除掉她！
Get rid of her, Press!

905
01:41:19,190 --> 01:41:20,400
低头
Duck your head.

906
01:41:21,990 --> 01:41:24,270
去你的，死吧
Let go, you motherfucker.

907
01:41:26,870 --> 01:41:29,530
- 我抓住你了  - 糟糕
- I got you. Hold on, I got you. - Shit.

908
01:41:35,170 --> 01:41:36,780
我还以为会没命
I thought I was dead.

909
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:43,510
我以为你再没机会喝长岛冰茶了
I thought you'd drank your last Long Island Ice Tea.

910
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:45,040
我以为大家都是
Yeah, I thought we all had.

911
01:41:47,430 --> 01:41:49,640
你没事吗？
Hey, you okay?

912
01:41:50,140 --> 01:41:51,380
没事
Yeah, I'm okay.

913
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:54,470
我的裤子很邋遢
My pants are a little messed up.

914
01:41:55,060 --> 01:41:56,390
不过我没事
But I'm okay.

915
01:41:58,820 --> 01:42:01,310
她是半人半怪物
She was half us, half something else.

916
01:42:02,150 --> 01:42:04,310
不知道哪边才是掠食性的
I wonder which was the predatory half.

917
01:42:05,660 --> 01:42:07,240
那死了的一边
The dead half.

918
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:09,070
我们走吧
Let's get the hell out of here.

919
01:42:53,580 --> 01:42:56,950
没想过回到水渠来 会这么开心的
I never thought I'd be so happy to be back in a sewer.

920
01:43:12,580 --> 01:43:15,280
浮煊

921
01:43:16,580 --> 01:43:19,580
谢谢观赏
