1
00:05:19,202 --> 00:05:20,786
I'm sorry.

2
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:23,205
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

3
00:06:15,884 --> 00:06:17,760
Sir, she's breaking out!

4
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,667
- Go! Go!
- What are we looking for?

5
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,137
She jumped over the fence!

6
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:19,256
A couple of trains came through here
about the time she escaped.

7
00:08:19,674 --> 00:08:22,676
Do you think she could have
gotten this far in that time?

8
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:24,386
Is she that fast?

9
00:08:24,596 --> 00:08:26,472
She is that fast.

10
00:09:10,058 --> 00:09:11,517
And this too.

11
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,520
- $3.10.
- Three dollars and ten cents?

12
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,563
Right.

13
00:09:18,107 --> 00:09:21,360
- Your change.
- Thank you.

14
00:09:21,903 --> 00:09:23,237
Can I help you?

15
00:09:24,614 --> 00:09:26,657
The total is $17.95.

16
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:32,162
Here's your card.

17
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,000
Are you gonna buy those?

18
00:09:49,597 --> 00:09:51,348
Have a nice trip.

19
00:09:56,938 --> 00:10:01,567
It's brown tweed bag, like a duffel.
Do you see it anywhere?

20
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,068
Sir, it's not here.

21
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:05,237
The porter said
he put it on the cart.

22
00:10:05,446 --> 00:10:07,447
This is the cart.
There's no bag here.

23
00:10:28,636 --> 00:10:33,140
<i>Authorities said
it was the largest earthquake to strike...</i>

24
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:35,309
<i>He's riding Greased Lightning.</i>

25
00:10:35,476 --> 00:10:37,728
<i>Whoa! That was Shorty Kincaid.</i>

26
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:42,691
Enjoy the view.

27
00:11:14,057 --> 00:11:15,307
Excuse me.

28
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,074
<i>We shouldn't be seen together.</i>

29
00:11:32,283 --> 00:11:35,827
<i>Father hasn't been dead long.
Do you think Arlen suspects?</i>

30
00:11:36,037 --> 00:11:39,206
<i>No. It's not
too soon for us to be together.</i>

31
00:11:41,793 --> 00:11:43,418
Tickets, please.

32
00:11:45,713 --> 00:11:47,714
Are you traveling by yourself?

33
00:11:48,216 --> 00:11:49,383
You're 12?

34
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:54,054
Someone meeting you
in Los Angeles?

35
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:57,891
We'll say you're 11.
Then you only pay half price.

36
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,373
Our little girl did this?

37
00:12:21,582 --> 00:12:22,999
She's not a little girl.

38
00:12:23,418 --> 00:12:26,962
DNA typing and material found in
those wounds proves it was her.

39
00:12:27,171 --> 00:12:31,133
She could be anywhere. Chicago,
Las Vegas, Los Angeles, anywhere.

40
00:12:31,342 --> 00:12:32,634
We should stop the trains.

41
00:12:32,844 --> 00:12:36,680
And have the railroad and police
ask questions we can't answer?

42
00:12:37,598 --> 00:12:40,851
We'll put key personnel at
every stop along these lines.

43
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:43,311
I want a team to track her.

44
00:12:43,521 --> 00:12:44,771
Hunt her down.

45
00:12:46,774 --> 00:12:48,608
- Good morning, Jill.
- Hello.

46
00:12:48,776 --> 00:12:53,363
- Thanks for taking care of my cat.
- We'll take good care of him.

47
00:12:53,614 --> 00:12:55,323
I won't be gone very long.

48
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:57,117
Take care.

49
00:12:58,703 --> 00:12:59,745
Bye-bye.

50
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,789
Are you still having
problems with the people at work?

51
00:13:02,957 --> 00:13:04,958
They point their finger
at me saying...

52
00:13:05,793 --> 00:13:09,379
...I'm the weird one,
I'm the strange one.

53
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:11,798
Why? Because I have feelings?

54
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:13,467
Because I feel?

55
00:13:16,888 --> 00:13:18,054
There's someone at the door.

56
00:13:19,557 --> 00:13:23,727
I won't answer that. Whoever it is
can come back at the end of the hour.

57
00:13:24,729 --> 00:13:25,979
That's for me.

58
00:13:27,815 --> 00:13:30,484
Sorry to interrupt.
We need your help, Dan.

59
00:13:31,319 --> 00:13:33,153
I know. Uh....

60
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:35,363
Gotta go.

61
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:42,032
Mr. Fitch will be with you all
in just a moment.

62
00:15:48,956 --> 00:15:50,206
Well....

63
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:54,127
I guess we all must be here
for the same reason...

64
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,712
...whatever that is.

65
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,422
I'm Dan Smithson...

66
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,593
...and I don't know why
I'm here either.

67
00:16:01,802 --> 00:16:06,222
But they said they needed me and
it was important, so I came.

68
00:16:07,058 --> 00:16:08,516
What do you do, Dan?

69
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:09,768
I....

70
00:16:10,895 --> 00:16:12,145
I'm an empath.

71
00:16:14,482 --> 00:16:18,193
Sometimes they show me awful things
people have done.

72
00:16:20,154 --> 00:16:21,821
I try to tell them why they did it.

73
00:16:22,156 --> 00:16:24,157
What qualifies you for that?

74
00:16:25,076 --> 00:16:26,993
I feel things deeply, that's all.

75
00:16:30,164 --> 00:16:32,082
What am I feeling now?

76
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,339
You wanna believe that
nothing affects you...

77
00:16:41,592 --> 00:16:43,510
...that you're not afraid of anything.

78
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:46,262
But you're curious...

79
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:49,265
...just like the rest of us.

80
00:16:51,435 --> 00:16:54,229
Stephen Arden.
Harvard Anthropology Department.

81
00:16:54,438 --> 00:16:56,189
Expert at cross-cultural behavior.

82
00:16:56,357 --> 00:16:59,275
Laura Baker. Hi. Molecular biologist.

83
00:17:00,861 --> 00:17:03,530
And who are you,
and what do you do?

84
00:17:04,281 --> 00:17:05,865
Preston Lennox.

85
00:17:06,701 --> 00:17:08,284
And if I'm here...

86
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:10,787
...the shit has hit the fan.

87
00:17:11,372 --> 00:17:14,207
What exactly is your area
of specialty, Mr. Lennox?

88
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,128
I'm a freelance solution to
our government's problems.

89
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,464
What exactly might they be?

90
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,219
The kind people don't usually
like to talk about.

91
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,056
You hunt people, don't you?

92
00:17:35,938 --> 00:17:37,272
I guess so.

93
00:17:47,324 --> 00:17:49,743
You in here? It's a little late for TV.

94
00:17:54,165 --> 00:17:55,749
You in here, honey?

95
00:18:47,968 --> 00:18:50,553
Good evening, I'm Xavier Fitch.

96
00:18:50,805 --> 00:18:52,639
I'm in charge of this operation.

97
00:18:52,807 --> 00:18:54,974
Would you sit a little closer, please?

98
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:07,403
In November of 1974...

99
00:19:07,988 --> 00:19:10,365
...a small group from S.E.T.I...

100
00:19:10,574 --> 00:19:13,660
...S-E-T-I, Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence...

101
00:19:13,828 --> 00:19:16,204
...used radio dishes at Arecibo...

102
00:19:16,413 --> 00:19:18,456
...to send a message to whoever
was listening.

103
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,376
They sent a quarter of a kilobyte...

104
00:19:21,585 --> 00:19:24,212
...including structure
of human DNA...

105
00:19:24,421 --> 00:19:26,506
...a map of our solar system...

106
00:19:26,674 --> 00:19:29,843
...population of the Earth.
Helpful facts like that.

107
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:36,683
In January of 1993, Arecibo
received a message back...

108
00:19:37,518 --> 00:19:39,144
...from an extra terrestrial...

109
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:40,937
...unknown source.

110
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:42,355
That's great.

111
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,024
Intelligent life beyond this planet?

112
00:19:45,192 --> 00:19:46,442
Yes.

113
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:49,195
There were two communications.

114
00:19:49,363 --> 00:19:53,950
The first message turned out to be
a superior catalyst for methane.

115
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,451
We now have the potential...

116
00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:58,872
...to produce infinite energy
from this clean-burning fuel.

117
00:19:59,707 --> 00:20:03,042
This convinced us we were dealing
with a friendly intelligence.

118
00:20:03,252 --> 00:20:07,714
The second message turned out
to be a new sequence of DNA...

119
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:11,176
...with friendly instructions
on how to combine it with ours.

120
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:15,388
Here's some technical data.
Get feedback from Dr. Baker.

121
00:20:15,598 --> 00:20:16,723
Basically...

122
00:20:16,891 --> 00:20:20,393
...the new combined
DNA sequence...

123
00:20:20,603 --> 00:20:22,854
...was injected into 100...

124
00:20:23,606 --> 00:20:25,356
...human ova.

125
00:20:28,235 --> 00:20:29,694
We got 7...

126
00:20:29,904 --> 00:20:31,070
...to divide.

127
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,864
Four petered out.

128
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,408
Two were stored in liquid nitrogen.

129
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,077
And we allowed one to grow.

130
00:20:38,913 --> 00:20:41,080
Its code name is "Sil."

131
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,083
That's after 2 hours.

132
00:20:45,586 --> 00:20:46,794
One day.

133
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:49,589
Two days.

134
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:52,258
- My God.
- This growth is amazing.

135
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:53,927
A week.

136
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,347
- It's a girl.
- Yes, I...

137
00:20:58,766 --> 00:21:00,141
We decided to make it female...

138
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:02,518
...so it would be more docile
and controllable.

139
00:21:02,686 --> 00:21:04,979
More docile and controllable, huh?

140
00:21:05,773 --> 00:21:08,358
Well, I guess you guys
don't get out much.

141
00:21:09,944 --> 00:21:13,154
That's her 1 month
after she was born.

142
00:21:13,697 --> 00:21:16,324
So you kept her caged in there?

143
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:18,952
It was safer to keep her isolated.

144
00:21:19,286 --> 00:21:21,287
She didn't like being locked up.

145
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:23,289
She didn't like being alone.

146
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,041
Didn't she?

147
00:21:29,213 --> 00:21:32,215
She's hiding something.
Something inside.

148
00:21:32,883 --> 00:21:34,300
You're right, Dan.

149
00:21:34,718 --> 00:21:38,721
This is three months after
she was born. Watch carefully.

150
00:21:40,808 --> 00:21:42,558
What the hell was that?

151
00:21:42,977 --> 00:21:44,227
Back the tape up.

152
00:21:47,564 --> 00:21:49,065
Watch her eyes.

153
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,150
Rapid eye movement.
She's dreaming.

154
00:21:54,321 --> 00:21:58,658
- She's having horrible nightmares.
- It's some kind of anxiety reaction.

155
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:00,451
Got me a little anxious.

156
00:22:00,661 --> 00:22:03,663
It made the research team
a little anxious too...

157
00:22:04,164 --> 00:22:07,250
...so the decision was made
to terminate the experiment...

158
00:22:07,835 --> 00:22:10,378
...to run more research to see
what we were dealing with.

159
00:22:13,507 --> 00:22:15,508
You were going to gas her?

160
00:22:16,051 --> 00:22:17,719
That was the decision.

161
00:22:19,513 --> 00:22:21,055
It makes you feel mad.

162
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:25,143
You feel mad that you had to
kill her, don't you?

163
00:22:25,352 --> 00:22:26,686
I don't know.

164
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:33,860
Wow.

165
00:22:34,028 --> 00:22:35,361
Yes.

166
00:22:39,908 --> 00:22:45,705
Yesterday the body of a transient was
found in a boxcar near Salt Lake City.

167
00:22:46,248 --> 00:22:48,666
Preliminary DNA tests conclude...

168
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:52,086
...he was killed by our creation,
by our Sil.

169
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:53,796
Found any other bodies?

170
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:55,506
- Not yet.
- You will.

171
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,383
She's a predator.

172
00:22:57,593 --> 00:22:59,302
Her eyes are in front.

173
00:23:00,554 --> 00:23:03,473
Her eyes are in front so she can
judge the distance to her prey.

174
00:23:03,724 --> 00:23:04,807
That's right.

175
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:06,392
Where'd you learn that?

176
00:23:06,977 --> 00:23:09,812
I saw it on the Discovery Channel.

177
00:23:11,315 --> 00:23:13,316
I caught that show myself.

178
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:16,486
- Mr. Lennox.
- Yeah?

179
00:23:16,653 --> 00:23:18,112
As the...

180
00:23:18,447 --> 00:23:22,283
...non-scientist amongst us,
are you clear about what's going on?

181
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:24,452
I think so.

182
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:28,081
You created a monster...

183
00:23:28,624 --> 00:23:31,292
...with a formula you got
from outer space.

184
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,588
The damn thing got away. Now you
want us to hunt it down and kill it.

185
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,591
Now, is that pretty close?

186
00:23:39,093 --> 00:23:40,510
I guess.

187
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:41,969
You don't want us...

188
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:45,264
...to capture her alive
so that we can study her?

189
00:23:46,642 --> 00:23:51,020
Laura, I think this is strictly a
search and destroy operation.

190
00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:55,733
Nobody ever asked me to find
anything they didn't want dead.

191
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,277
I'm sorry for you.

192
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:01,280
Yeah, well....

193
00:24:01,448 --> 00:24:02,949
Thank you, Dan.

194
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,451
I'm sorry for her.

195
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:10,289
<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>

196
00:24:10,457 --> 00:24:14,710
<i>Welcome to Los Angeles. This is
the terminal stop for the Desert Star.</i>

197
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,463
<i>All passengers please disembark.</i>

198
00:24:18,048 --> 00:24:23,678
<i>Trains of Chicago,
Salt Lake City, Las Vegas and Barstow...</i>

199
00:24:24,304 --> 00:24:26,722
<i>...have arrived on track number five.</i>

200
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,211
Something bad happened here.

201
00:25:38,545 --> 00:25:40,379
- No shit.
- Crushed her larynx.

202
00:25:40,547 --> 00:25:42,256
She was afraid.

203
00:25:42,466 --> 00:25:44,884
She's scared, frightened.

204
00:25:45,052 --> 00:25:47,970
Hungry too.
She's been eating like a horse.

205
00:25:48,472 --> 00:25:50,806
Our girl is definitely not on a diet.

206
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:54,268
She's storing calories for something.

207
00:25:54,478 --> 00:25:55,895
Any ideas?

208
00:25:57,481 --> 00:25:58,523
Oh, my....

209
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:02,235
Well, that's....

210
00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:04,737
That looks like some sort of...

211
00:26:05,155 --> 00:26:07,782
...chrysalis. Some kind of cocoon.

212
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,409
What are we looking for,
a giant moth?

213
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:14,830
If that is a cocoon...

214
00:26:14,998 --> 00:26:17,542
- ...she'll be fully-grown now.
- Fully-grown.

215
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:20,211
Maybe that's how
she got by our people.

216
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,046
They were looking for a child.

217
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:23,923
She is a child.

218
00:26:25,133 --> 00:26:27,969
It stinks in here. I'm going outside.

219
00:26:35,102 --> 00:26:38,896
Get the conductors' ID and
credit card numbers on your computer.

220
00:26:39,106 --> 00:26:41,148
There's no sign of them on the train.

221
00:26:41,608 --> 00:26:44,277
- Let's assume she took them.
- I'll see to that.

222
00:26:44,486 --> 00:26:46,153
She kills if she's threatened.

223
00:26:46,989 --> 00:26:49,782
And she has no remorse about it.
None.

224
00:26:49,992 --> 00:26:52,326
Of course, Los Angeles
is perfect for her.

225
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:54,120
It's a city of the future.

226
00:26:54,288 --> 00:26:55,538
Anything goes.

227
00:26:55,706 --> 00:26:58,499
Totally mobile population.
Everyone's a stranger.

228
00:26:58,959 --> 00:27:00,751
Very little is taboo or unacceptable.

229
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,962
Whatever she does,
no one will notice her.

230
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,339
Well, whatever. So....

231
00:27:06,341 --> 00:27:09,302
Los Angeles is where the battle
will be fought...

232
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:12,013
...and won.

233
00:27:37,748 --> 00:27:39,540
You look very pretty.

234
00:27:41,418 --> 00:27:42,835
Do you have a hundred?

235
00:27:45,339 --> 00:27:46,589
Here we are.

236
00:27:48,175 --> 00:27:52,511
Be more careful with your money.
Not everybody's as honest as me.

237
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:57,016
Are you foreign?

238
00:28:00,354 --> 00:28:01,520
Do you speak English?

239
00:28:02,689 --> 00:28:06,025
- Yes.
- Here. You keep this.

240
00:28:07,361 --> 00:28:09,612
Here, let me take this.

241
00:28:10,906 --> 00:28:12,156
Be careful here.

242
00:28:12,449 --> 00:28:13,699
Yes.

243
00:28:19,706 --> 00:28:21,457
Watch your step.

244
00:28:33,804 --> 00:28:35,888
Our laboratory, Visitor Base One...

245
00:28:36,056 --> 00:28:40,559
...is being moved to some empty virus
research labs at the university.

246
00:28:40,727 --> 00:28:44,271
They're moving our equipment now.
It'll be operational by 8:00.

247
00:28:44,481 --> 00:28:47,733
Check into your rooms. Everyone out
front in 15 minutes. We'll go over.

248
00:28:47,901 --> 00:28:49,402
What will we do?

249
00:28:49,569 --> 00:28:51,904
Process the evidence from the train.

250
00:28:52,072 --> 00:28:55,616
Could we try growing this creature
with its own DNA?

251
00:28:55,784 --> 00:29:00,955
We do a version without ours this time
and investigate its vulnerabilities.

252
00:29:01,164 --> 00:29:02,248
That'd be good.

253
00:29:02,582 --> 00:29:04,959
- Then I could know how it feels.
- Makes sense.

254
00:29:05,168 --> 00:29:07,920
This human life form could be a mask.
Without the camouflage...

255
00:29:08,088 --> 00:29:11,090
You're right. At least we'd know
what we were dealing with.

256
00:30:08,857 --> 00:30:12,318
A couple of bozos just ran out.
I got a customer.

257
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:15,821
- Yes, young lady. Can I help you?
- I want a room.

258
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:20,868
62, including tax. That'll just
about cover the Honeymoon Suite.

259
00:30:40,347 --> 00:30:42,014
<i>Hi. Come here often?</i>

260
00:30:43,225 --> 00:30:44,558
<i>What's your sign?</i>

261
00:30:54,736 --> 00:30:56,737
<i>Tired of brunette?</i>

262
00:30:57,197 --> 00:30:58,656
<i>Change.</i>

263
00:30:58,865 --> 00:31:01,200
<i>Change the color of your hair.</i>

264
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:02,701
<i>Color-Tress.</i>

265
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:13,254
I've increased the magnification.

266
00:31:18,927 --> 00:31:22,596
When I pierce the cell,
the foreign DNA will be introduced.

267
00:31:33,608 --> 00:31:34,859
Shit!

268
00:31:35,443 --> 00:31:37,278
The camera's gone down.

269
00:31:38,488 --> 00:31:39,530
Excuse me.

270
00:31:40,407 --> 00:31:41,907
Do you have a replacement camera?

271
00:31:42,117 --> 00:31:45,744
We do, but it'll take time for
the technician to replace it.

272
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:49,623
No. This happens in my lab
all the time. It's simple to replace it.

273
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:51,542
You saying you can do it?

274
00:31:51,751 --> 00:31:54,503
Sure I can. I just need somebody
to give me a hand.

275
00:31:54,671 --> 00:31:57,923
I don't want technicians in there.
This is classified.

276
00:31:58,133 --> 00:32:02,136
I'll do it.

277
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:05,264
- Man of action, I like that.
- That's me.

278
00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:17,776
Can you get that one for me?

279
00:32:40,967 --> 00:32:43,093
Give me the camera.

280
00:32:55,482 --> 00:32:58,525
Something's... Something's wrong.

281
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:06,283
Christ, It's started already.

282
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,954
- It's started. Get the top back on.
- What?

283
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:12,247
Laura, Press, get the top back on.

284
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,833
Here you go.

285
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:17,795
She must have penetrated the cell.

286
00:33:19,506 --> 00:33:20,839
- Shit.
- What was that?

287
00:33:21,007 --> 00:33:22,132
He dropped the bolt.

288
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:26,804
- Find the bolt. Get the top on.
- I'm looking, Fitch.

289
00:33:28,723 --> 00:33:30,224
Can they hear me in there?

290
00:33:30,392 --> 00:33:31,684
Laura, Press...

291
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:34,979
- ...get the top on, then I'll let you out.
- Where'd it go?

292
00:33:39,067 --> 00:33:41,652
- It fell through the grate.
- Can you lift it up?

293
00:33:44,823 --> 00:33:47,324
- It's not gonna move.
- This isn't going anywhere.

294
00:33:47,534 --> 00:33:49,034
- No, can't get it!
- Press...

295
00:33:49,202 --> 00:33:51,036
...you gotta get the bolt!

296
00:33:51,204 --> 00:33:52,329
Can't get it.

297
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,082
- The floor's welded down.
- Oh, my God.

298
00:33:55,417 --> 00:33:57,042
Press. Oh, my God.

299
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,378
- I've never seen anything like this.
- Holy shit.

300
00:33:59,587 --> 00:34:00,963
I can't let them out.

301
00:34:01,131 --> 00:34:03,590
- Press, look.
- Come on.

302
00:34:05,051 --> 00:34:06,552
Fitch, let us out of here!

303
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:08,637
Open the goddamn door!

304
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:12,016
- Not until I know what's in there!
- Open it now!

305
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:13,726
- Let them out.
- I can't!

306
00:34:13,893 --> 00:34:16,186
- Open up the fucking door!
- Let us out!

307
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:20,232
- Tell me it'll stop growing, Dan.
- It's not, let them out!

308
00:34:23,486 --> 00:34:25,279
Open up the door!

309
00:34:25,447 --> 00:34:26,947
Press, Press.

310
00:34:28,408 --> 00:34:29,825
What the fuck is that?!

311
00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:32,411
Laura, get to the other door!

312
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:34,663
- Let her out, Fitch!
- I can't!

313
00:34:34,914 --> 00:34:36,707
- Let her out!
- I can't!

314
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:38,584
- You motherfucker!
- Let her out!

315
00:34:38,752 --> 00:34:41,253
- You've gotta let them out!
- I can't hold it in!

316
00:34:41,463 --> 00:34:42,755
Get out of the way!

317
00:34:42,922 --> 00:34:44,923
I'm gonna burn it!
Out of the way!

318
00:34:48,595 --> 00:34:51,555
- What is this thing?
- In 2 minutes, I'm burning the room!

319
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:54,099
- What?
- I have to do it!

320
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:55,768
You have two minutes to kill it.

321
00:34:56,269 --> 00:34:59,188
Disconnect the gas line.
Use it as a flamethrower.

322
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:07,863
- Aah!
- Laura, watch out!

323
00:35:10,784 --> 00:35:12,451
- Where'd it go?
- In the pipes!

324
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:14,119
- Open the door!
- Shut up, Dan!

325
00:35:17,791 --> 00:35:19,625
<i>One minute remaining.</i>

326
00:35:31,805 --> 00:35:33,222
Laura...

327
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,974
...it stopped moving. I think I killed it.

328
00:35:37,227 --> 00:35:39,019
It's dead! Open the door!

329
00:35:39,229 --> 00:35:40,979
It's dead, Fitch. Let them out.

330
00:35:44,984 --> 00:35:47,778
Oh, God, it's not dead.

331
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:54,701
Oh!

332
00:35:55,328 --> 00:35:57,287
- Shit.
- What'll we do?

333
00:35:57,497 --> 00:35:59,248
<i>30 seconds remaining.</i>

334
00:35:59,415 --> 00:36:01,834
- There's not much time. Let's go.
- Open the door!

335
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:03,752
- Let them out.
- I can't do that.

336
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:05,879
- I have to follow protocol!
- What protocol?!

337
00:36:06,089 --> 00:36:07,881
The protocols by which
we're doing this!

338
00:36:08,174 --> 00:36:10,759
You didn't tell them that
before they went in.

339
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,428
- Fitch, let them out.
- Twelve, 11, 10....

340
00:36:13,596 --> 00:36:16,181
- Fitch, let them out!
- I must follow protocol.

341
00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:17,641
Let them out, Fitch!

342
00:36:17,934 --> 00:36:20,185
Go. Get out of there!

343
00:36:20,854 --> 00:36:23,355
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

344
00:36:23,523 --> 00:36:25,315
- I had no choice.
- Yeah, sure.

345
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:28,902
The protocol is to burn the room
if anything went wrong!

346
00:36:49,757 --> 00:36:51,717
Where's a good place
to find a man?

347
00:36:52,093 --> 00:36:55,971
There's plenty of guys at the Id
around the corner. It's a club.

348
00:36:56,181 --> 00:36:58,515
You won't have trouble
meeting somebody there.

349
00:36:58,683 --> 00:36:59,725
Thank you.

350
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:02,436
You can't miss it.
Look for the long line.

351
00:37:02,645 --> 00:37:04,730
I need your credit card...

352
00:37:05,064 --> 00:37:08,609
...for room incidentals,
long distance calls and so forth.

353
00:37:08,818 --> 00:37:10,569
Credit card? Zip zap?

354
00:37:10,987 --> 00:37:13,238
American Express, Visa,
MasterCard?

355
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,158
There you go. Thanks. All right.

356
00:37:16,451 --> 00:37:17,492
Thank you.

357
00:37:18,411 --> 00:37:19,745
Hey, wait a minute! Hey! Hey!

358
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:27,002
You don't want this falling
into the wrong hands.

359
00:37:27,295 --> 00:37:28,670
No.

360
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,799
<i>Here's Justin Crawl. It's through.</i>

361
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:36,261
<i>And it's covered by the goalie.
18:42 let to go.</i>

362
00:37:36,429 --> 00:37:37,471
Yeah?

363
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,473
The conductor's credit card
turned up...

364
00:37:39,641 --> 00:37:42,309
...in a Hollywood motel.
The van's out front.

365
00:37:42,518 --> 00:37:43,769
<i>Let's go.</i>

366
00:37:47,357 --> 00:37:48,607
You two.

367
00:37:53,947 --> 00:37:55,280
Enjoy yourselves.

368
00:37:55,865 --> 00:37:58,951
You, legs. You're in. Go on.

369
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,975
Where are you from?

370
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,520
- I'm foreign.
- You're what?

371
00:38:26,729 --> 00:38:28,814
- I'm foreign.
- Really?

372
00:38:29,649 --> 00:38:30,816
Easy, easy.

373
00:38:30,984 --> 00:38:33,860
I've got a party to go to
and no one to take me.

374
00:38:34,028 --> 00:38:35,445
I'll take you.

375
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,072
- You will?
- Yeah.

376
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,324
Okay. I'm going
to the little girls' room.

377
00:38:40,576 --> 00:38:42,244
Wait right here.

378
00:38:42,662 --> 00:38:44,162
I'll be right back.

379
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:45,831
I'll be right here.

380
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,727
Whatever it takes, right?

381
00:39:07,895 --> 00:39:10,147
All's fair in love and war.

382
00:39:16,904 --> 00:39:18,322
Buddy....

383
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,882
Can't see much on that.

384
00:39:37,091 --> 00:39:39,760
Get this tape to the lab. Enhance it.

385
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:41,928
See if we can get a better look.

386
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:43,930
She looks nice.

387
00:39:44,432 --> 00:39:46,558
Do you have any idea
where she went?

388
00:39:46,768 --> 00:39:50,312
- I'll find her.
- She wanted to meet a man.

389
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:53,273
I suggested a club called
the Id around the corner.

390
00:39:55,234 --> 00:39:56,610
Get the tape.

391
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:18,799
I've got a party to go to
and no one to take me.

392
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,093
Where is this party?

393
00:40:21,761 --> 00:40:22,969
I don't know.

394
00:40:32,772 --> 00:40:34,940
Whoa, you can't park there!

395
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,900
Back that out!

396
00:40:37,485 --> 00:40:40,779
- No, you can't go in there.
- What's going on?!

397
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:59,464
- There's been a murder!
- No one leaves here! I mean, nobody!

398
00:41:02,969 --> 00:41:05,637
There's always some action
in this part of town.

399
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:19,818
<i>Blue-eyed blonde.</i>

400
00:41:20,027 --> 00:41:23,989
Black leggings, pink sweater, 5' 10"
tall. Who'd she leave with?

401
00:41:24,198 --> 00:41:26,825
Blonde leaves with a guy
is hardly news around here.

402
00:41:27,034 --> 00:41:28,994
Name the top attractions. No losers.

403
00:41:29,203 --> 00:41:31,538
Assume he's socially adept.
He'll be helping her out.

404
00:41:31,706 --> 00:41:33,790
A friendly guy, not an asshole.

405
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,667
I'm thinking.

406
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:38,628
- Robbie left with a blonde.
- That's him.

407
00:41:39,714 --> 00:41:40,964
That's him.

408
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,842
Come on. Let me show you
the rest of the house.

409
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,845
I'm still sweaty from that place.

410
00:41:47,054 --> 00:41:48,513
It's so crowded.

411
00:41:53,853 --> 00:41:55,061
Like it?

412
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:57,522
Yes.

413
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:59,232
I feel like a shower.

414
00:42:00,193 --> 00:42:01,401
You want one?

415
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:03,695
Tell you what.

416
00:42:03,905 --> 00:42:05,363
I'm taking one.

417
00:42:05,573 --> 00:42:07,282
You wanna take one later...

418
00:42:07,533 --> 00:42:08,950
...no problem.

419
00:42:52,912 --> 00:42:54,579
Take off your clothes.

420
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:57,916
I want to see you.

421
00:43:05,383 --> 00:43:06,925
Very nice.

422
00:43:17,478 --> 00:43:18,853
Take me back.

423
00:43:19,021 --> 00:43:20,981
What are you talking about?

424
00:43:21,232 --> 00:43:22,983
You know why we came here.

425
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:24,943
I've changed my mind.

426
00:43:25,111 --> 00:43:27,571
All right. You said "no."

427
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:30,365
It's duly noted. Come here.

428
00:43:30,575 --> 00:43:31,658
I wanna go!

429
00:43:31,826 --> 00:43:34,911
Too late. You're not leaving!
You're not!

430
00:43:37,832 --> 00:43:40,584
- All right.
- That's better.

431
00:45:09,548 --> 00:45:13,093
What's happening? Kills a girl
at the club, kills this guy.

432
00:45:13,302 --> 00:45:16,346
I'd say she fits the definition
of a psychopath.

433
00:45:16,555 --> 00:45:18,390
Nothing inhibits her.

434
00:45:18,808 --> 00:45:21,309
No moral sense, no social structure.

435
00:45:22,061 --> 00:45:25,689
She wasn't exactly smothered with a
mother's love or taught good manners.

436
00:45:25,898 --> 00:45:27,649
I asked what was happening.

437
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:30,026
He did something, she was angry.

438
00:45:30,236 --> 00:45:33,196
She'll kill if she's threatened
or if anyone gets in her way.

439
00:45:33,406 --> 00:45:34,614
Of what?

440
00:45:34,824 --> 00:45:36,074
Her life cycle.

441
00:45:36,325 --> 00:45:38,410
I think she's trying to mate.

442
00:45:38,744 --> 00:45:39,786
Reproduce.

443
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:41,413
Okay.

444
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,373
So why did she kill the girl?

445
00:45:43,582 --> 00:45:45,375
Sexual competition.

446
00:45:45,584 --> 00:45:47,127
She's hard on the competition.

447
00:45:47,461 --> 00:45:48,753
Now she managed to mate.

448
00:45:49,338 --> 00:45:53,049
Doesn't look like a success.
He's still got his pants on.

449
00:45:53,259 --> 00:45:55,552
- She's frustrated.
- Who isn't?

450
00:45:55,761 --> 00:45:58,388
What's her problem?
She was here with him.

451
00:45:58,597 --> 00:46:00,223
Maybe she rejected him.

452
00:46:00,433 --> 00:46:02,350
She probably has special senses.

453
00:46:02,518 --> 00:46:06,813
Rats can sense diseased or genetic
damage in their potential mates...

454
00:46:07,022 --> 00:46:08,481
...so we can test his body...

455
00:46:08,691 --> 00:46:13,278
...for hereditary diseases or defects
that would make him a loser...

456
00:46:13,446 --> 00:46:14,779
...essentially.

457
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:16,281
Needles.

458
00:46:16,949 --> 00:46:20,034
Maybe he was a doper,
or a diabetic.

459
00:46:20,286 --> 00:46:23,121
Either way would make
him unacceptable. Excuse me.

460
00:46:25,207 --> 00:46:26,458
All right.

461
00:46:28,711 --> 00:46:30,962
Insulin. Diabetic.
There you have it.

462
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:33,840
She could have just walked out.
Why kill him?

463
00:46:34,049 --> 00:46:36,176
He pissed her off.

464
00:46:36,385 --> 00:46:38,845
Some men, when rejected,
get insistent.

465
00:46:39,054 --> 00:46:41,681
- Put an APB out on his car.
- We have.

466
00:46:41,891 --> 00:46:44,893
We'll go back to the motel.
I want to check it out.

467
00:46:45,227 --> 00:46:48,146
More docile and controllable,
huh, Fitch?

468
00:47:02,703 --> 00:47:05,246
- What do you think, Dan?
- What do I think?

469
00:47:06,081 --> 00:47:07,957
I think she'd want to be alone now.

470
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:12,837
I don't think she's gonna come
here with all these cars outside.

471
00:47:13,005 --> 00:47:16,007
You're assuming she could
find her way back here.

472
00:47:16,175 --> 00:47:17,425
She could.

473
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:19,260
What is it?

474
00:47:20,846 --> 00:47:22,806
Maybe menstrual blood.

475
00:47:23,682 --> 00:47:26,351
If she's menstruating,
she can reproduce.

476
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:27,811
Yes, I know.

477
00:49:04,617 --> 00:49:05,950
Shit.

478
00:49:11,457 --> 00:49:12,957
Oh, Jesus.

479
00:49:13,167 --> 00:49:14,417
Excuse me.

480
00:49:15,336 --> 00:49:18,129
Call a paramedic!
Anybody got a phone?

481
00:49:23,677 --> 00:49:26,554
<i>If your commute
takes you westbound on the 10 freeway...</i>

482
00:49:26,764 --> 00:49:28,306
<i>...expect an hour delay.</i>

483
00:49:28,515 --> 00:49:30,934
<i>The drive will be slow to Malibu.</i>

484
00:49:37,858 --> 00:49:40,401
The video enhancement
is not that great.

485
00:49:40,611 --> 00:49:42,779
How old do you
think she is? Twenty, 23?

486
00:49:44,615 --> 00:49:47,116
Her reproductive system
should be fully developed.

487
00:49:47,326 --> 00:49:49,327
Her biological clock must be
in hyperdrive.

488
00:49:49,536 --> 00:49:50,662
She wants a baby.

489
00:49:50,829 --> 00:49:53,581
If she has a child
our problems have just begun.

490
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:56,876
If her offspring is male and develops
at the same rate as Sil...

491
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:00,713
...it could reproduce in 6 months.

492
00:50:02,049 --> 00:50:04,550
God knows how many females
it could impregnate.

493
00:50:04,718 --> 00:50:06,219
Fitch.

494
00:50:08,722 --> 00:50:10,848
When a predatory species
is introduced...

495
00:50:11,016 --> 00:50:12,684
...into a closed ecological system...

496
00:50:12,851 --> 00:50:15,937
...the extinction of the weaker species
is inevitable.

497
00:50:16,105 --> 00:50:18,856
They found the murdered guy's BMW,
out of gas in Santa Monica.

498
00:50:19,191 --> 00:50:20,316
What's her name?

499
00:50:20,526 --> 00:50:22,694
- I don't know.
- Who are you?

500
00:50:22,903 --> 00:50:26,990
She didn't have any ID.
I thought I'd make sure she was okay.

501
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,992
You think she's got insurance?

502
00:50:29,201 --> 00:50:32,745
I don't know. Just put it on
my credit card for now.

503
00:50:33,247 --> 00:50:36,916
And you don't know her name.
Guys like you are hard to find.

504
00:50:44,216 --> 00:50:46,759
Get a lab workup on that, stat.

505
00:50:49,596 --> 00:50:52,348
Get her up to x-ray.
I want an x-ray on this.

506
00:50:52,558 --> 00:50:54,934
It looks like a scapula fracture.

507
00:51:04,403 --> 00:51:06,070
Your shoulder wound.

508
00:51:09,408 --> 00:51:11,242
What's going on here?

509
00:51:16,623 --> 00:51:17,832
Doctor, we need you now.

510
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,333
A child burn victim just came in.

511
00:51:19,501 --> 00:51:21,252
- What is going on here?
- Doctor, please.

512
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:24,047
Jesus Christ!
Did you see her shoulder?

513
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:26,299
Please. We need you immediately.

514
00:51:35,142 --> 00:51:36,476
You're okay.

515
00:51:36,769 --> 00:51:37,894
I'm okay.

516
00:51:38,103 --> 00:51:40,646
I was sure you were
seriously injured.

517
00:51:41,148 --> 00:51:42,315
I'm okay.

518
00:51:42,608 --> 00:51:44,609
You are. It's a miracle.

519
00:51:45,486 --> 00:51:46,611
Can we go?

520
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:49,572
Did the doctor say you could go?

521
00:51:49,782 --> 00:51:50,990
Yes.

522
00:51:52,367 --> 00:51:54,911
We'll send somebody over there.
Thanks a lot.

523
00:51:57,623 --> 00:52:02,126
Doctor over at Parkbay Hospital
called in with some weird story.

524
00:52:02,294 --> 00:52:04,462
We should check it out.
It's a few miles away.

525
00:52:04,797 --> 00:52:06,089
Laura...

526
00:52:06,465 --> 00:52:08,633
...Press, take a car, check it out.

527
00:52:08,801 --> 00:52:11,427
- Parkbay Hospital?
- Yeah, Parkbay.

528
00:52:13,764 --> 00:52:17,058
She walked.

529
00:52:18,811 --> 00:52:20,144
She walked that way...

530
00:52:21,647 --> 00:52:22,980
...not too long ago.

531
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:33,116
Got some fruit and cheese.

532
00:52:35,327 --> 00:52:36,577
What is that?

533
00:52:36,954 --> 00:52:38,496
You mean the hot tub?

534
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:40,665
A hot tub.

535
00:52:41,166 --> 00:52:42,542
I love this place.

536
00:52:42,709 --> 00:52:45,628
It's away from the traffic
and business and people.

537
00:52:45,963 --> 00:52:48,631
Sometimes it feels like
you're not in L.A. anymore.

538
00:52:49,133 --> 00:52:50,341
Here.

539
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:52,468
We'll immortalize the moment.

540
00:53:02,563 --> 00:53:03,896
Look at the camera.

541
00:53:09,361 --> 00:53:12,155
This girl literally
reformed her bones.

542
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:13,656
It's her.

543
00:53:13,824 --> 00:53:15,158
Who checked her in?

544
00:53:15,409 --> 00:53:17,285
I don't know. Let's find out.

545
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:20,913
She had no insurance so this guy
put it on his own credit card.

546
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:25,168
Here's the file. John F. Carey.

547
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:30,047
You don't have a driver's license
or home address?

548
00:53:30,215 --> 00:53:33,759
No, sir.
Just an imprint of his credit card.

549
00:53:34,678 --> 00:53:36,804
Give us a printout
of what you've got.

550
00:53:37,014 --> 00:53:38,347
No problem.

551
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,810
Some candy?

552
00:53:52,779 --> 00:53:56,073
It's in the Palisades and
he's got a phone number.

553
00:53:56,742 --> 00:53:59,785
Tell Fitch where we're headed,
and try to get John Carey on the line.

554
00:54:29,816 --> 00:54:31,651
I'd better get the phone.

555
00:54:38,951 --> 00:54:41,327
I've got his machine.
Should I leave a message?

556
00:54:41,495 --> 00:54:42,828
Yeah.

557
00:54:42,996 --> 00:54:45,998
Tell him he's about to copulate
with a creature from outer space.

558
00:54:47,459 --> 00:54:49,335
- Copulate, huh?
- Yeah.

559
00:54:50,963 --> 00:54:52,213
I like you.

560
00:54:52,464 --> 00:54:53,714
I know.

561
00:54:58,637 --> 00:55:00,888
It's not too soon for us
to be together.

562
00:55:02,391 --> 00:55:04,225
No, it's not too soon.

563
00:55:06,228 --> 00:55:07,728
You don't need these.

564
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,189
Hey, hey. That's a little fast.

565
00:55:10,399 --> 00:55:13,609
Whoa! Whoo! Whoo!
Oh! Whoa!

566
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:21,033
Whoa!

567
00:55:23,578 --> 00:55:24,912
What's the matter?

568
00:55:25,497 --> 00:55:26,831
Take it easy.

569
00:55:29,668 --> 00:55:31,168
Just relax.

570
00:55:32,838 --> 00:55:34,171
There's plenty of time.

571
00:55:42,931 --> 00:55:44,181
What is it?

572
00:55:46,852 --> 00:55:48,894
I think someone's at the door.

573
00:55:49,062 --> 00:55:50,313
Don't go.

574
00:55:51,023 --> 00:55:53,149
Please. I want a baby.

575
00:55:53,442 --> 00:55:55,693
What?! Excuse me?

576
00:56:05,871 --> 00:56:07,705
Let's go around the side.

577
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:52,249
<i>Outside.</i>

578
00:58:49,743 --> 00:58:52,870
- What happened?
- A squirrel! A fucking squirrel!

579
00:58:53,079 --> 00:58:55,539
- She was here.
- Yeah, she was.

580
00:58:55,749 --> 00:58:57,917
I wanna make sure
she's not still here.

581
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:28,322
Perhaps we should check the body
for evidence that they've had sex.

582
00:59:35,747 --> 00:59:38,082
I used to be scared
at the sight of blood.

583
00:59:38,917 --> 00:59:40,751
Now I guess I'm getting used to it.

584
00:59:42,003 --> 00:59:43,504
Oh, yes.

585
01:00:08,989 --> 01:00:10,281
- Hey!
- Help me, please!

586
01:00:10,448 --> 01:00:12,074
Oh, my God. What's the matter?

587
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:14,910
We found this in the living room.

588
01:00:16,788 --> 01:00:18,080
She liked him.

589
01:00:19,958 --> 01:00:21,625
Well, not enough.

590
01:00:22,294 --> 01:00:25,421
Can't see any more on that than
we did on the video monitor.

591
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:27,881
He didn't get a good picture of her.

592
01:00:28,049 --> 01:00:31,135
There's no evidence of semen
in the hot tub water.

593
01:00:31,595 --> 01:00:33,137
Maybe she took it with.

594
01:00:33,305 --> 01:00:35,472
So she probably
hasn't managed to mate.

595
01:00:35,724 --> 01:00:38,767
- We interrupted her.
- Yes, I think we did.

596
01:00:38,977 --> 01:00:40,978
Give me something I can use.

597
01:00:42,439 --> 01:00:44,315
What have you
come up with lately, Fitch?

598
01:00:49,988 --> 01:00:51,488
She's not scared of us.

599
01:00:51,906 --> 01:00:53,157
That's for sure.

600
01:00:57,037 --> 01:00:58,537
We're all beat.

601
01:00:58,872 --> 01:01:00,748
We'll go back to the hotel and rest.

602
01:01:01,666 --> 01:01:03,208
Tomorrow night...

603
01:01:03,585 --> 01:01:05,336
...we'll go back to the club.

604
01:01:06,463 --> 01:01:08,172
- Stake it out.
- Stake it out.

605
01:01:11,259 --> 01:01:12,509
She's not stupid.

606
01:01:12,677 --> 01:01:14,219
She won't repeat herself.

607
01:01:14,429 --> 01:01:17,681
There's no point going there.
It provided a poor specimen.

608
01:01:17,891 --> 01:01:18,932
I'm not sure.

609
01:01:19,142 --> 01:01:21,852
She's been in the city two days.
It's what she knows.

610
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:23,729
I'd rather try the club...

611
01:01:23,938 --> 01:01:28,359
...than sit at the command center
reminiscing about how close we got.

612
01:01:41,748 --> 01:01:44,541
She would make one excellent
biological weapon.

613
01:01:44,751 --> 01:01:48,712
If someone thought we were some
kind of galactic weed that would...

614
01:01:48,922 --> 01:01:50,923
...spread through the universe.

615
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:54,259
So what you're saying is that...

616
01:01:54,594 --> 01:01:56,887
...she's the cure and
we're the disease.

617
01:01:57,389 --> 01:01:58,639
That's well said.

618
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:01,517
"Baker, Laura.

619
01:02:01,726 --> 01:02:05,437
1735 Meander Drive,
Simi Valley, California."

620
01:02:05,647 --> 01:02:07,064
That's you, right?

621
01:02:07,816 --> 01:02:09,566
Last time I checked.

622
01:02:09,984 --> 01:02:11,944
What do you do for kicks out there?

623
01:02:12,904 --> 01:02:13,987
Oh....

624
01:02:14,155 --> 01:02:16,198
Pine for guys like you.

625
01:02:16,408 --> 01:02:17,658
That's what I thought.

626
01:02:39,472 --> 01:02:40,848
So anyone hungry?

627
01:02:41,141 --> 01:02:45,269
Uh, no, thanks. I'm beat.
I'm gonna try to get some sleep.

628
01:02:45,478 --> 01:02:47,688
- Good night.
- Yeah. Night.

629
01:02:48,982 --> 01:02:52,151
- I'll have something to eat with you.
- Thanks, Dan.

630
01:03:54,714 --> 01:03:57,257
- Do you ever have nightmares?
- Yes.

631
01:03:58,051 --> 01:04:00,177
Please untie my hands.

632
01:04:00,553 --> 01:04:03,388
- I wouldn't hurt you. Please.
- I have them.

633
01:04:06,851 --> 01:04:08,435
I think they tell me who I am.

634
01:04:09,187 --> 01:04:11,021
Why are you doing this to me?

635
01:04:13,733 --> 01:04:15,526
I don't know why I'm here.

636
01:04:15,735 --> 01:04:18,195
I don't know who I am, who sent me.

637
01:04:20,031 --> 01:04:22,032
- Do you?
- No!

638
01:04:25,537 --> 01:04:28,539
- Why do you think you're here?
- I don't know.

639
01:04:29,541 --> 01:04:31,166
Please let me go.

640
01:04:31,376 --> 01:04:33,752
Please. Please, let me go.

641
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:38,048
I wouldn't hurt you.

642
01:04:38,383 --> 01:04:39,967
I promise.

643
01:04:40,134 --> 01:04:42,302
- I wouldn't hurt you.
- Yes, you would.

644
01:04:43,221 --> 01:04:44,638
You just don't know it yet.

645
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,891
No, I wouldn't!

646
01:04:48,059 --> 01:04:49,476
Please!

647
01:04:51,062 --> 01:04:53,480
My hands are hurting me.

648
01:04:57,735 --> 01:05:01,238
Thank you.

649
01:05:07,829 --> 01:05:09,454
Oh, my God!

650
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,180
Oh, my God, no!

651
01:05:28,433 --> 01:05:30,893
No! No!

652
01:07:29,971 --> 01:07:31,972
Laura and Press,
they like each other.

653
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:34,266
They just don't like to show
how they feel.

654
01:07:34,434 --> 01:07:35,809
What?

655
01:07:36,686 --> 01:07:39,229
Laura and Press,
they like each other.

656
01:07:39,605 --> 01:07:41,356
Yeah, whatever you say, Dan.

657
01:07:41,566 --> 01:07:44,735
Look, it's really smoky in here.
I'm gonna go outside, get some air.

658
01:07:45,111 --> 01:07:49,281
Think I'll lie down in the van. Have a
rest. This is a complete waste of time.

659
01:07:52,118 --> 01:07:53,994
Get a feeling you're on
a wild goose chase?

660
01:07:54,162 --> 01:07:55,579
Yeah.

661
01:07:56,748 --> 01:07:57,956
Excuse me.

662
01:08:58,643 --> 01:09:01,478
Get out of here. This is my trashcan.

663
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:13,990
It's you.

664
01:09:21,207 --> 01:09:22,332
Hey!

665
01:09:23,209 --> 01:09:25,293
She's here! Hey!

666
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:33,510
- Dan. Is that her?
- Yeah.

667
01:09:33,678 --> 01:09:34,886
Here.

668
01:09:41,352 --> 01:09:42,936
Get in the van.

669
01:09:44,897 --> 01:09:46,815
Everybody get in the van!

670
01:09:55,366 --> 01:09:58,368
They're heading into the hills.
We'll need the helicopters.

671
01:10:09,922 --> 01:10:14,426
We're going up Nichols Canyon. One
of you try to block her at Mulholland.

672
01:10:31,152 --> 01:10:32,903
Whoa! Watch it!

673
01:11:34,465 --> 01:11:36,174
Oh, my God!

674
01:12:11,294 --> 01:12:15,046
We blocked the road.
We've gotta tell the press something.

675
01:12:15,256 --> 01:12:18,133
Tell them what you want,
just don't tell them the truth.

676
01:12:18,342 --> 01:12:21,594
I don't buy her showing up at
the club. It's too damn convenient.

677
01:12:22,138 --> 01:12:24,639
Seeing is believing or
don't you trust your eyes?

678
01:12:24,849 --> 01:12:27,017
Get back! Get all these people back!

679
01:12:27,268 --> 01:12:30,270
Fitch. Fitch. It doesn't feel right.

680
01:12:30,604 --> 01:12:31,855
Sir!

681
01:12:32,023 --> 01:12:35,734
We found a severed thumb in
one of the doors that got ripped off.

682
01:12:35,943 --> 01:12:39,154
- Let me see that.
- She may have caught it in the door.

683
01:12:39,363 --> 01:12:41,364
Get to the lab, see if it's hers.

684
01:12:41,782 --> 01:12:44,826
- It'll be genetically identifiable.
- It's all over, everyone.

685
01:12:44,994 --> 01:12:47,329
Tomorrow you can go back
to your lives.

686
01:12:47,538 --> 01:12:49,873
Congratulations on a job well done.

687
01:12:53,377 --> 01:12:55,378
Just like that, huh, Fitch?

688
01:12:56,047 --> 01:12:57,547
I don't think so.

689
01:13:08,267 --> 01:13:10,143
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

690
01:13:10,311 --> 01:13:11,895
<i>And Frank, I'm going to dinner.</i>

691
01:13:12,063 --> 01:13:14,731
<i>Where are we meeting?
Bye, sweetie.</i>

692
01:13:17,401 --> 01:13:18,610
Waiter.

693
01:13:20,112 --> 01:13:21,571
Well, I guess we won.

694
01:13:22,907 --> 01:13:26,951
- We won, science lost.
- I didn't think we'd get her this way.

695
01:13:27,912 --> 01:13:30,038
- Not that easy.
- You sound like you'll miss her.

696
01:13:30,206 --> 01:13:31,373
I guess I will.

697
01:13:32,291 --> 01:13:33,958
I think I respected her.

698
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:40,757
I know this was a hellish job, but I
really enjoyed working with you three.

699
01:13:40,966 --> 01:13:43,885
And since Uncle Sam is buying,
let's have another round.

700
01:13:44,053 --> 01:13:45,095
Waiter!

701
01:13:45,388 --> 01:13:47,263
I don't... I don't drink.

702
01:13:47,598 --> 01:13:49,224
Don't worry, Dan. Tonight you will.

703
01:13:51,268 --> 01:13:52,769
You wanna dance?

704
01:13:52,937 --> 01:13:55,063
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you.

705
01:13:58,234 --> 01:14:00,402
- All right.
- Okay.

706
01:14:16,419 --> 01:14:21,089
I know you don't have a family.
Do you have a girlfriend in New York?

707
01:14:22,133 --> 01:14:25,593
I guess I've had a few, but
they don't hang around very long.

708
01:14:26,429 --> 01:14:28,596
I guess I keep too many secrets.

709
01:14:29,223 --> 01:14:30,640
You wanna share one with me?

710
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:32,976
- Right now?
- Yeah.

711
01:14:38,482 --> 01:14:41,901
I know what you do,
and it doesn't scare me.

712
01:14:42,111 --> 01:14:44,320
- Really?
- No.

713
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:46,531
Well, it does most people.

714
01:14:51,203 --> 01:14:53,621
I wouldn't wanna
never see you again.

715
01:15:00,921 --> 01:15:02,172
- Hey.
- What are you...?

716
01:15:02,339 --> 01:15:06,259
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I thought you were somebody else.

717
01:15:06,427 --> 01:15:07,844
I'm sorry.

718
01:15:09,763 --> 01:15:11,014
You okay?

719
01:15:11,182 --> 01:15:13,808
I thought it was Sil.
I saw the blonde hair.

720
01:15:14,018 --> 01:15:15,518
She's dead, Press.

721
01:15:15,686 --> 01:15:18,229
The tests on the thumb
proved it was her.

722
01:15:18,439 --> 01:15:21,649
You got your test and I got my gut.
I just don't buy it.

723
01:15:22,359 --> 01:15:26,362
I think as long as you feel
she's out there, you got a mission.

724
01:15:26,530 --> 01:15:28,198
Maybe you don't want
this job to be over.

725
01:15:28,365 --> 01:15:31,951
Uh-huh. Well, maybe not.
So what?

726
01:15:35,372 --> 01:15:37,040
Thanks for the dance.

727
01:15:51,514 --> 01:15:52,722
Good night.

728
01:15:59,772 --> 01:16:01,022
What do you call this?

729
01:16:01,398 --> 01:16:03,566
It's called a Long Island Ice Tea.

730
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:06,194
It's got tea in it?

731
01:16:07,196 --> 01:16:08,404
Nope.

732
01:16:25,881 --> 01:16:27,882
Smells nice, can I try some?

733
01:16:28,717 --> 01:16:30,218
Help yourself.

734
01:16:35,432 --> 01:16:37,225
Does it work on your boyfriend?

735
01:16:37,434 --> 01:16:39,394
Yeah. As a repellent.

736
01:16:43,274 --> 01:16:46,734
I don't know. I think he's in remarkably
good shape for a man his age.

737
01:16:58,414 --> 01:17:00,498
One Long Island Ice Tea.

738
01:17:02,751 --> 01:17:05,003
I like these cups of tea.

739
01:17:07,298 --> 01:17:09,299
- What?
- That's great.

740
01:17:09,592 --> 01:17:12,093
What? What?

741
01:17:15,306 --> 01:17:17,181
Hey, give me one of those.

742
01:17:18,017 --> 01:17:20,643
I like these cups of tea, man.

743
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,813
You guys, I'm tired.
I'm gonna go to bed.

744
01:17:27,151 --> 01:17:28,359
So?

745
01:17:30,029 --> 01:17:31,321
She's going to bed.

746
01:17:31,530 --> 01:17:32,864
I guess.

747
01:17:34,867 --> 01:17:36,534
She still...

748
01:17:37,494 --> 01:17:39,287
...wants to see you though.

749
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,501
Maybe I'll go find out
if you're right about that.

750
01:18:11,612 --> 01:18:13,780
I'd hate to be in here
during an earthquake.

751
01:18:13,947 --> 01:18:15,281
Yeah.

752
01:18:15,699 --> 01:18:17,283
What floor do you want?

753
01:18:17,701 --> 01:18:19,369
Ten, please.

754
01:18:29,213 --> 01:18:31,297
I like your perfume.

755
01:18:31,882 --> 01:18:33,091
You do?

756
01:18:33,717 --> 01:18:36,969
- Thank you.
- Excuse me. I get out here.

757
01:18:41,141 --> 01:18:42,392
Good night.

758
01:19:08,043 --> 01:19:09,210
Yes!

759
01:19:19,346 --> 01:19:21,389
- Hi.
- Hi.

760
01:19:39,032 --> 01:19:40,616
Did you want something?

761
01:19:41,535 --> 01:19:44,036
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

762
01:20:29,625 --> 01:20:31,250
Housekeeping.

763
01:20:32,669 --> 01:20:35,630
Dan. Dan.

764
01:20:35,798 --> 01:20:38,966
Those two over there.
Bet they like unusual men like us.

765
01:20:40,302 --> 01:20:42,178
Women think I'm strange.

766
01:20:42,679 --> 01:20:44,055
I don't feel well.

767
01:20:44,556 --> 01:20:46,140
Don't be silly.

768
01:20:46,642 --> 01:20:48,726
Just go over there and talk to them.

769
01:20:48,977 --> 01:20:52,146
I have to go. And I think
you should leave with me, okay?

770
01:20:54,691 --> 01:20:57,109
I'm gonna stay for a while, actually.

771
01:20:59,696 --> 01:21:00,905
Okay.

772
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:03,407
I'll see you tomorrow.

773
01:21:06,411 --> 01:21:07,620
Housekeeping.

774
01:21:22,803 --> 01:21:24,095
- Hi.
- Hi.

775
01:21:24,263 --> 01:21:26,681
I was sitting over there, wondering...

776
01:21:26,890 --> 01:21:30,434
...what two intelligent, glamorous
women were doing without dates.

777
01:21:30,644 --> 01:21:32,186
My name's Stephen Arden.

778
01:21:32,396 --> 01:21:34,522
I teach anthropology at Harvard.

779
01:21:34,731 --> 01:21:36,357
- I lived in Boston once.
- Yeah?

780
01:21:36,567 --> 01:21:37,775
- Hi.
- For a year.

781
01:21:37,943 --> 01:21:40,862
- Froze my butt off.
- It's cold in Boston.

782
01:21:41,071 --> 01:21:43,489
This is Bill and Tony.
I forget your name.

783
01:21:49,204 --> 01:21:50,705
Cute little socks.

784
01:21:52,416 --> 01:21:53,875
Stand up.

785
01:22:33,832 --> 01:22:35,416
How'd you get in here?

786
01:22:35,751 --> 01:22:37,960
- I stole the key.
- What?

787
01:22:38,462 --> 01:22:41,255
I saw you downstairs, but
you were with all those people.

788
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:43,799
So I thought I'd come up and wait.

789
01:22:44,301 --> 01:22:45,551
Whoa.

790
01:22:47,429 --> 01:22:49,764
This kind of thing doesn't
usually happen to me.

791
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:52,767
I just want to be with you.

792
01:22:52,935 --> 01:22:54,852
Hmm? You...?

793
01:23:03,737 --> 01:23:05,321
Oh, yes.

794
01:23:19,628 --> 01:23:21,045
What about protection?

795
01:24:16,435 --> 01:24:18,436
She's here. She's here.

796
01:24:47,466 --> 01:24:48,924
- Press?
- Hmm?

797
01:24:49,259 --> 01:24:50,968
Someone's at the door.

798
01:24:52,888 --> 01:24:53,929
Who's there?

799
01:24:54,139 --> 01:24:55,389
Press, Laura.

800
01:24:55,557 --> 01:24:57,600
It's Dan. I gotta talk to you.

801
01:24:57,976 --> 01:25:00,436
Christ, what does he want?

802
01:25:10,363 --> 01:25:13,240
- What's the problem, Dan?
- I just got this terrible feeling.

803
01:25:13,450 --> 01:25:16,577
I get this strange thought,
this image of Sil with Arden.

804
01:25:16,787 --> 01:25:18,204
Sil's next door with Arden, Press.

805
01:25:18,622 --> 01:25:20,915
No, no, no. She's dead, Dan.

806
01:25:21,291 --> 01:25:24,960
I went to his room and there's
someone in there with him.

807
01:25:25,128 --> 01:25:28,672
- Did you knock on the door?
- Yes, but I don't know what she'll do.

808
01:25:28,924 --> 01:25:32,718
They're making a lot of noise.
They're having sex.

809
01:25:32,928 --> 01:25:35,096
I know it's Sil, I know it!

810
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:36,722
Okay.

811
01:25:37,099 --> 01:25:39,141
I believe you. I'll get dressed.

812
01:25:49,528 --> 01:25:51,112
Oh, my God.

813
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:57,034
I enjoyed that immensely.

814
01:26:06,211 --> 01:26:07,378
Oh.

815
01:26:15,554 --> 01:26:18,180
- I felt it.
- What?

816
01:26:21,726 --> 01:26:23,018
It's started.

817
01:26:24,020 --> 01:26:25,646
What's started?

818
01:26:25,814 --> 01:26:26,856
Life.

819
01:26:28,275 --> 01:26:30,192
Oh, my darling girl.

820
01:26:30,735 --> 01:26:34,905
In some cultures, women believe
they know the moment of conception...

821
01:26:35,115 --> 01:26:36,782
Don't you believe me? Feel.

822
01:26:42,289 --> 01:26:43,455
Holy shit!

823
01:26:49,796 --> 01:26:51,797
I hope you're right about this, Dan.

824
01:27:04,144 --> 01:27:06,562
- She's headed for the basement.
- We'll take the stairs.

825
01:27:06,730 --> 01:27:08,147
Laura, come with me!

826
01:27:08,356 --> 01:27:09,565
Come on!

827
01:27:12,527 --> 01:27:16,697
If she's pregnant, we gotta
get to her before she gives birth.

828
01:27:16,865 --> 01:27:19,783
God. We don't know what
we're dealing with here.

829
01:27:19,951 --> 01:27:23,829
She could have a dozen babies.
She could lay 1000 eggs!

830
01:27:23,997 --> 01:27:27,333
Oh, God. Did you see Arden?

831
01:27:27,542 --> 01:27:29,251
Yeah, I did, that poor bastard.

832
01:27:29,419 --> 01:27:34,048
We can trap her. The fire door opens
from the inside at the bottom exit.

833
01:27:34,257 --> 01:27:35,299
Then what?

834
01:27:37,761 --> 01:27:39,011
Holy shit.

835
01:27:39,179 --> 01:27:42,306
- Oh, my God.
- The bitch went through a steel door!

836
01:27:42,641 --> 01:27:45,434
Fitch! Dan! We're in the garage!
She got past us!

837
01:27:56,821 --> 01:27:59,365
- You saw her?
- She was gone before we got here.

838
01:27:59,532 --> 01:28:00,908
- Here.
- You saw her!

839
01:28:01,076 --> 01:28:03,077
- Look at the door!
- Which way did she go?

840
01:28:03,245 --> 01:28:04,485
- I don't know.
- Where's Press?

841
01:28:04,579 --> 01:28:06,038
He took off down that tunnel.

842
01:28:21,054 --> 01:28:24,056
She kills if she feels threatened.

843
01:28:24,224 --> 01:28:26,392
She kills if she feels threatened.

844
01:28:48,707 --> 01:28:50,666
She must've come through here.

845
01:29:13,148 --> 01:29:15,190
She went down
here. There's no other way.

846
01:29:15,358 --> 01:29:16,817
Yeah, she's down there.

847
01:29:18,069 --> 01:29:19,320
Let's go.

848
01:29:19,821 --> 01:29:22,156
Stand back, I'll clear it out.

849
01:30:15,377 --> 01:30:17,544
Which way did she go, Dan?

850
01:30:18,797 --> 01:30:19,838
I don't know.

851
01:30:20,006 --> 01:30:22,925
- What?
- I'm not sure. She's here.

852
01:30:23,134 --> 01:30:28,055
Think. You're supposed to have some
extrasensory power! Which way?

853
01:30:28,848 --> 01:30:31,683
- Which way did she go, Dan?
- I don't know!

854
01:30:31,851 --> 01:30:33,977
- I don't know!
- Which way did she go?

855
01:30:36,272 --> 01:30:37,752
- I think she went that way.
- Think?!

856
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:39,108
That's good enough for me.

857
01:30:39,275 --> 01:30:41,110
You think she went that way?

858
01:30:42,404 --> 01:30:45,114
You don't fucking know, don't you?
You don't fucking know.

859
01:30:45,281 --> 01:30:47,699
I'll go this way. You come with me.

860
01:30:47,909 --> 01:30:50,035
- Come with me, Dan!
- Fitch.

861
01:30:51,788 --> 01:30:53,539
I think she went this way.

862
01:31:11,391 --> 01:31:17,646
Dan?

863
01:31:52,599 --> 01:31:54,266
Aah!

864
01:31:54,893 --> 01:31:56,143
Fitch. Fitch.

865
01:31:57,687 --> 01:31:59,104
Dan?

866
01:32:01,733 --> 01:32:03,108
What happened?

867
01:32:12,368 --> 01:32:13,702
I can feel her.

868
01:32:14,370 --> 01:32:18,040
She's that way.

869
01:32:22,045 --> 01:32:24,713
I never thought
I'd want to kill something.

870
01:32:25,089 --> 01:32:26,757
Never thought I'd want to.

871
01:32:58,456 --> 01:32:59,581
Hey.

872
01:33:02,168 --> 01:33:05,170
It's this way. It's back here.

873
01:33:36,327 --> 01:33:38,537
Hey, she went in here.

874
01:33:43,793 --> 01:33:46,211
This must have opened up
during the earthquake.

875
01:33:47,547 --> 01:33:49,298
Okay, stand back.

876
01:35:01,496 --> 01:35:02,704
Wow.

877
01:35:05,333 --> 01:35:06,541
Is that oil?

878
01:35:06,834 --> 01:35:08,168
Looks like it.

879
01:35:15,843 --> 01:35:19,054
I'm going back there to see
if I can flush her out.

880
01:35:19,222 --> 01:35:22,057
If she comes back through here,
let her have it.

881
01:35:37,323 --> 01:35:39,241
Dan. Dan!

882
01:36:38,968 --> 01:36:42,137
- Dan, what is it?
- I don't know.

883
01:36:42,305 --> 01:36:43,638
I don't know.

884
01:37:44,367 --> 01:37:45,659
Dan.

885
01:38:07,139 --> 01:38:08,723
Okay.

886
01:38:10,643 --> 01:38:11,935
It's okay.

887
01:38:13,563 --> 01:38:14,855
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

888
01:38:15,690 --> 01:38:16,940
You come here.

889
01:38:19,235 --> 01:38:21,236
Come on. I got you.

890
01:38:24,365 --> 01:38:26,116
Aah! Unh!

891
01:38:26,284 --> 01:38:28,618
Press, something's happened
to Dan!

892
01:38:29,620 --> 01:38:31,079
You okay?

893
01:38:32,456 --> 01:38:35,333
Oh! Shit!

894
01:38:37,461 --> 01:38:38,962
Dan?

895
01:38:39,964 --> 01:38:41,631
Dan?

896
01:38:42,466 --> 01:38:43,800
I'm stuck!

897
01:38:46,012 --> 01:38:47,387
Press!

898
01:38:48,848 --> 01:38:51,433
I need your help! I'm stuck!

899
01:39:17,877 --> 01:39:19,127
Press!

900
01:39:20,463 --> 01:39:22,464
Dan, you gotta hang on!

901
01:39:29,764 --> 01:39:31,389
Press!

902
01:39:35,519 --> 01:39:36,770
Dan, keep on.

903
01:39:50,910 --> 01:39:53,495
Press!

904
01:40:43,379 --> 01:40:44,671
Hang on, Dan!

905
01:40:47,008 --> 01:40:48,216
Hang on!

906
01:40:49,427 --> 01:40:50,468
I got you.

907
01:40:52,346 --> 01:40:54,347
I got you, Dan. Hang on.

908
01:40:55,057 --> 01:40:56,433
Shit.

909
01:41:04,025 --> 01:41:05,525
Hang on!

910
01:41:07,570 --> 01:41:08,737
Hang on, Dan!

911
01:41:13,034 --> 01:41:14,951
Get rid of her, Press!

912
01:41:19,457 --> 01:41:20,665
Duck your head.

913
01:41:22,251 --> 01:41:24,544
Let go, you motherfucker.

914
01:41:27,131 --> 01:41:29,799
- I got you. Hold on, I got you.
- Shit.

915
01:41:35,431 --> 01:41:37,057
I thought I was dead.

916
01:41:40,561 --> 01:41:43,772
I thought you'd drank your
last Long Island Ice Tea.

917
01:41:43,939 --> 01:41:45,315
Yeah, I thought we all had.

918
01:41:47,693 --> 01:41:49,903
Hey, you okay?

919
01:41:50,404 --> 01:41:51,654
Yeah, I'm okay.

920
01:41:52,823 --> 01:41:54,741
My pants are a little messed up.

921
01:41:55,326 --> 01:41:56,659
But I'm okay.

922
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:01,581
She was half us,
half something else.

923
01:42:02,416 --> 01:42:04,584
I wonder which was
the predatory half.

924
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:07,504
The dead half.

925
01:42:07,838 --> 01:42:09,339
Let's get the hell out of here.

926
01:42:53,843 --> 01:42:57,220
I never thought I'd be
so happy to be back in a sewer.
