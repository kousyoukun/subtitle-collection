1
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,527
I'm sorry.

2
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,946
I'm sorry?

3
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,501
Sir, she's breaking out!

4
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,033
What are we looking for?

5
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,878
She jumped over the fence!

6
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,997
A couple of trains came through here
about the time she escaped.

7
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:22,417
Do you think she could have
gotten this far in that time?

8
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,127
Is she that fast?

9
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,213
She is that fast.

10
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,258
And this too.

11
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,428
- $3. 10.
- Three dollars and ten cents?

12
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:21,101
- Your change.
- Thank you.

13
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:22,978
Can I help you?

14
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,398
The total is $17.95.

15
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,903
Here's your card.

16
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,741
Are you gonna buy those?

17
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,089
Have a nice trip.

18
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:01,308
It's brown tweed bag, like a duffel.
Do you see it anywhere?

19
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:04,978
- Sir, it's not here.
- The porter said he put it on the cart.

20
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,188
This is the cart.
There's no bag here.

21
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:32,881
Government authorities said it was
the largest earthquake to strike-

22
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,966
He's riding Greased Lightning.

23
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,469
That was Shorty Kincaid.

24
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,432
Enjoy the view.

25
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,048
Excuse me.

26
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,815
We shouldn't be seen together.

27
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:35,568
Father hasn't been dead long.
Do you think Arlen suspects?

28
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,947
No. It's not too soon
for us to be together.

29
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:42,784
Tickets.

30
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,455
Are you traveling by yourself?

31
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,124
You're 12?

32
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,795
Someone meeting you
in Los Angeles?

33
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,632
We'll say you're 11.
Then you only pay half price.

34
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,114
Our little girl did this?

35
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,741
She's not a little girl.

36
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,703
DNA typing and material found in
those wounds proves it was her.

37
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:30,874
She could be anywhere. Chicago,
Las Vegas, Los Angeles, anywhere.

38
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,375
We should stop the trains.

39
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:36,421
And have the railroad and police
ask questions we can't answer?

40
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,592
We'll put key personnel at
every stop along these lines.

41
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,052
I want a team to track her.

42
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,512
Hunt her down.

43
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,349
- Good morning, Jill.
- Hello.

44
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:53,104
- Thanks for taking care of my cat.
- We'll take good care of him.

45
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,064
I won't be gone very long.

46
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,858
Take care.

47
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,486
Bye-bye.

48
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,530
Are you still having problems
with the people at work?

49
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,699
They point their finger
at me saying...

50
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:09,120
...I'm the weird one,
I'm the strange one.

51
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,539
Why? Because I have feelings?

52
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,208
Because I feel?

53
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,213
There's someone at the door.

54
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:23,468
I won't answer that. Whoever it is
can come back at the end of the hour.

55
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,720
That's for me.

56
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:30,225
Sorry to interrupt.
We need your help, Dan.

57
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,310
I know.

58
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,230
Gotta go.

59
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,773
Mr. Fitch will be with you all
in just a moment.

60
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:49,948
Well...

61
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,868
I guess we all must be here
for the same reason...

62
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:55,578
...whatever that is.

63
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,163
I'm Dan Smithson...

64
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,334
...and I don't know why
I'm here either.

65
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,964
But they said they needed me and
it was important, so I came.

66
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,216
What do you do, Dan?

67
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,886
I'm an empath.

68
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,934
Sometimes they show me awful things
people have done.

69
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,562
I try to tell them why they did it.

70
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,898
What qualifies you for that?

71
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,734
I feel things deeply, that's all.

72
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,823
What am I feeling now?

73
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:39,080
You wanna believe that
nothing affects you...

74
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,251
...that you're not afraid of anything.

75
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,004
But you're curious...

76
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,007
...just like the rest of us.

77
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,970
Stephen Arden.
Harvard Anthropology Department.

78
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,930
Expert at cross-cultural behavior.

79
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:59,017
Laura Baker. Hi. Molecular biologist.

80
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:03,271
And who are you,
and what do you do?

81
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,606
Preston Lennox.

82
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,026
And if I'm here...

83
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,528
...the shit has hit the fan.

84
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,948
What exactly is your area
of specialty, Mr. Lennox?

85
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,369
I'm a freelance solution to
our government's problems.

86
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,205
What exactly might they be?

87
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,960
The kind people don't usually
like to talk about.

88
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,797
You hunt people, don't you?

89
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,013
I guess so.

90
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,484
You in here? It's a little late for TV.

91
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,490
You in here, honey?

92
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,294
Good evening, I'm Xavier Fitch.

93
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,380
I'm in charge of this operation.

94
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,715
Would you sit a little closer, please?

95
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,145
In November of 1974...

96
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,106
...a small group from S. E.T. I...

97
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,401
...S-E-T-I, Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence...

98
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,945
...used radio dishes at Arecibo...

99
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,197
...to send a message to whoever
was listening.

100
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,117
They sent a quarter of a kilobyte...

101
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,953
...including structure
of human DNA...

102
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,247
...a map of our solar system...

103
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,584
...population of the Earth.
Helpful facts like that.

104
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:36,424
In January of 1993, Arecibo
received a message back...

105
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,885
...from an extra terrestrial...

106
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,678
...unknown source.

107
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,096
That's great.

108
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,765
Intelligent life beyond this planet?

109
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,184
Yes.

110
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,936
There were two communications.

111
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:53,691
The first message turned out to be
a superior catalyst for methane.

112
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,193
We now have the potential...

113
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,613
...to produce infinite energy
from this clean-burning fuel.

114
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,783
This convinced us we were dealing
with a friendly intelligence.

115
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:07,455
The second message turned out
to be a new sequence of DNA...

116
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,917
...with friendly instructions
on how to combine it with ours.

117
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:15,129
Here's some technical data.
Get feedback from Dr. Baker.

118
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,464
Basically...

119
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:20,134
...the new combined
DNA sequence...

120
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,595
...was injected into 100...

121
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,097
...human ova.

122
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,435
We got 7...

123
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,811
...to divide.

124
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,605
Four petered out.

125
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,149
Two were stored in liquid nitrogen.

126
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,818
And we allowed one to grow.

127
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,821
Its code name is "Sil. "

128
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,824
That's after 2 hours.

129
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,535
One day.

130
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,497
Two days.

131
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,999
- My God.
- This growth is amazing.

132
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,668
A week.

133
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,504
- It's a girl.
- Yes.

134
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,509
We decided to make it female
so it would be more docile...

135
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:04,720
- ... and controllable.
- More docile and controllable, huh?

136
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,099
Well, I guess you guys
don't get out much.

137
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,895
That's her 1 month
after she was born.

138
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,065
So you kept her caged in there?

139
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,693
It was safer to keep her isolated.

140
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,028
She didn't like being locked up.

141
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,030
She didn't like being alone.

142
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,782
Didn't she?

143
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,956
She's hiding something.
Something inside.

144
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,041
You're right, Dan.

145
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:38,462
This is three months after
she was born. Watch carefully.

146
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,300
What the hell was that?

147
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:43,968
Back the tape up.

148
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,806
Watch her eyes.

149
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,809
Rapid eye movement.
She's dreaming.

150
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:58,399
- She's having horrible nightmares.
- It's some kind of anxiety reaction.

151
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,192
Got me a little anxious.

152
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,404
It made the research team
a little anxious too...

153
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:06,991
...so the decision was made
to terminate the experiment...

154
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,119
...to run more research to see
what we were dealing with.

155
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,249
You were going to gas her?

156
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,460
That was the decision.

157
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,796
It makes you feel mad.

158
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,884
You feel mad that you had to
kill her, don't you?

159
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,427
I don't know.

160
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,102
Yes.

161
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:45,446
Yesterday the body of a transient was
found in a boxcar near Salt Lake City.

162
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:48,407
Preliminary DNA tests conclude...

163
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,827
...he was killed by our creation,
by our Sil.

164
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,537
Found any other bodies?

165
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,247
- Not yet.
- You will.

166
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,124
She's a predator.

167
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,043
Her eyes are in front...

168
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:03,214
...so she can judge the distance
to her prey.

169
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,548
That's right.

170
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,133
Where'd you learn that?

171
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,553
I saw it on the Discovery Channel.

172
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,057
I caught that show myself.

173
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,227
- Mr. Lennox.
- Yeah?

174
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,853
As the...

175
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:22,024
...non-scientist amongst us,
are you clear about what's going on?

176
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,193
I think so.

177
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,822
You created a monster...

178
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,033
...with a formula you got
from outer space.

179
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:35,329
The damn thing got away. Now you
want us to hunt it down and kill it.

180
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,332
Now, is that pretty close?

181
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,251
I guess.

182
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,710
You don't want us...

183
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:45,005
...to capture her alive
so that we can study her?

184
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:50,761
Laura, I think this is strictly a
search and destroy operation.

185
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,474
Nobody ever asked me to find
anything they didn't want dead.

186
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,018
I'm sorry for you.

187
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,021
Yeah, well...

188
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,690
Thank you, Dan.

189
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,192
I'm sorry for her.

190
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,030
May I have your attention, please?

191
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:14,452
Welcome to Los Angeles. This is
the terminal stop for the Desert Star.

192
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:17,204
All passengers please disembark.

193
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,952
Something bad happened here.

194
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,120
- No shit.
- Crushed her larynx.

195
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,997
She was afraid.

196
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,625
She's scared, frightened.

197
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,711
Hungry too.
She's been eating like a horse.

198
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,548
Our girl is definitely not on a diet.

199
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,009
She's storing calories for something.

200
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,636
Any ideas?

201
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,472
Oh, my...

202
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,976
Well, that's...

203
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,478
That looks like some sort of...

204
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,523
...chrysalis. Some kind of cocoon.

205
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,150
What are we looking for,
a giant moth?

206
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,572
If that is a cocoon...

207
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,283
- ... she'll be fully-grown now.
- Fully-grown.

208
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,952
Maybe that's how
she got by our people.

209
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,787
They were looking for a child.

210
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,664
She is a child.

211
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:27,710
It stinks in here. I'm going outside.

212
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:38,637
Get the conductors' ID and credit card
numbers on your computer.

213
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,889
There's no sign of them on the train.

214
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:44,018
- Let's assume she took them.
- I'll see to that.

215
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,894
She kills if she's threatened.

216
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,523
And she has no remorse about it.
None.

217
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,067
Of course, Los Angeles
is perfect for her.

218
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,861
It's a city of the future.

219
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,279
Anything goes.

220
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,240
Totally mobile population.
Everyone's a stranger.

221
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,492
Very little is taboo or unacceptable.

222
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,703
Whatever she does,
no one will notice her.

223
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,080
Well, whatever. So...

224
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:09,043
Los Angeles is where the battle
will be fought...

225
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,754
...and won.

226
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,281
You look very pretty.

227
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,576
Do you have a hundred?

228
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,330
Here we are.

229
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:52,252
Be more careful with your money.
Not everybody's as honest as me.

230
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,757
Are you foreign?

231
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,261
Do you speak English?

232
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,766
- Yes.
- Here. You keep this.

233
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,353
Here, let me take this.

234
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,897
Be careful here.

235
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,440
Yes.

236
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,198
Watch your step.

237
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,629
Our laboratory, Visitor Base One...

238
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:40,300
...is being moved to some empty virus
research labs at the university.

239
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:44,012
They're moving our equipment now.
It'll be operational by 8:00.

240
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:47,474
Check into your rooms. Everyone out
front in 15 minutes. We'll go over.

241
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:49,143
What will we do?

242
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,645
Process the evidence from the train.

243
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:55,357
Could we try growing this creature
with its own DNA?

244
00:28:55,525 --> 00:29:00,696
We do a version without ours this time
and investigate its vulnerabilities.

245
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:01,989
That'd be good.

246
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:04,700
- Then I could know how it feels.
- Makes sense.

247
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,661
This human life form could be a mask.
Without the camouflage-

248
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,831
You're right. At least we'd know
what we were dealing with.

249
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:12,059
A couple of bozos just ran out.
I got a customer.

250
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,562
- Yes, young lady. Can I help you?
- I want a room.

251
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:20,609
62, including tax. That'll just
about cover the Honeymoon Suite.

252
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,755
Hi. Come here often?

253
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,299
What's your sign?

254
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:56,478
Tired of brunette?

255
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,397
Change.

256
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,941
Change the color of your hair.

257
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,484
Color-Tress.

258
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,995
I've increased the magnification.

259
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:22,337
When I pierce the cell,
the foreign DNA will be introduced.

260
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:34,600
Shit!

261
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,019
The camera's gone down.

262
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,313
Excuse me.

263
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,648
Do you have a replacement camera?

264
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:45,485
We do, but it'll take time for
the technician to replace it.

265
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:49,364
No. This happens in my lab
all the time. It's simple to replace it.

266
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:51,283
You saying you can do it?

267
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:54,244
Sure I can. I just need somebody
to give me a hand.

268
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:57,664
I don't want technicians in there.
This is classified.

269
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,124
I'll do it.

270
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:01,877
I'll do it.

271
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:05,005
- Man of action, I like that.
- That's me.

272
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,517
Can you get that one for me?

273
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,834
Give me the camera.

274
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:58,266
Something's- Something's wrong.

275
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,024
Christ, It's started already.

276
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:09,695
- It's started. Get the top back on.
- What?

277
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,989
Laura, Press, get the top back on.

278
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,574
Here you go.

279
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,536
She must have penetrated the cell.

280
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:20,580
- Shit.
- What was that?

281
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:21,873
He dropped the bolt.

282
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:26,545
- Find the bolt. Get the top on.
- I'm looking, Fitch.

283
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:29,965
Can they hear me in there?

284
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,425
Laura, Press...

285
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:34,720
- ... get the top on, then I'll let you out.
- Where'd it go?

286
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:41,393
- It fell through the grate.
- Can you lift it up?

287
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:47,065
- It's not gonna move.
- This isn't going anywhere.

288
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,775
- No, can't get it!
- Press...

289
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,777
...you gotta get the bolt!

290
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:54,823
- Can't get it. The floor's welded down.
- Oh, my God.

291
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,783
Press. Oh, my God.

292
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,119
- I've never seen anything like this.
- Holy shit.

293
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,704
I can't let them out.

294
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,331
- Press, look.
- Come on.

295
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,293
Fitch, let us out of here!

296
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,378
Open the goddamn door!

297
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:11,757
- Not until I know what's in there!
- Open it now!

298
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,467
- Let them out.
- I can't!

299
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,927
- Open up the fucking door!
- Let us out!

300
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:19,973
- Tell me it'll stop growing, Dan.
- It's not, let them out!

301
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,020
Open up the door!

302
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,688
Press, Press.

303
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,566
What the fuck is that?!

304
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,152
Laura, get to the other door!

305
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,404
- Let her out, Fitch!
- I can't!

306
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,448
- Let her out!
- I can't!

307
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:38,325
- You motherfucker!
- Let her out!

308
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,994
- You've gotta let them out!
- I can't hold it in!

309
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,496
Get out of the way!

310
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,664
I'm gonna burn it!
Out of the way!

311
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:51,463
- What is this thing?
- In 2 minutes, I'm burning the room!

312
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,840
I have to do it!

313
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,509
You have two minutes to kill it.

314
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,929
Disconnect the gas line.
Use it as a flamethrower.

315
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,604
Laura, watch out!

316
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,150
- Where'd it go?
- In the pipes!

317
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,860
- Open the door!
- Shut up, Dan!

318
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,366
One minute remaining.

319
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:32,963
Laura...

320
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,715
...it stopped moving. I think I killed it.

321
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,760
It's dead! Open the door!

322
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,720
It's dead, Fitch. Let them out.

323
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:47,519
Oh, God, it's not dead.

324
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,028
- Shit.
- What'll we do?

325
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,738
30 seconds remaining.

326
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:01,575
- There's not much time. Let's go.
- Open the door!

327
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,493
- Let them out.
- I can't do that.

328
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,620
- I have to follow protocol!
- What protocol?!

329
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,622
The protocols by which
we're doing this!

330
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:10,500
You didn't tell them that
before they went in.

331
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,170
- Fitch, let them out.
- Twelve, 11, 10...

332
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,922
- Fitch, let them out!
- I must follow protocol.

333
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,382
Let them out, Fitch!

334
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,926
Go. Get out of there!

335
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,096
Three, two, one.

336
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,056
- I had no choice.
- Yeah, sure.

337
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:28,643
The protocol is to burn the room
if anything went wrong!

338
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:51,458
Where's a good place
to find a man?

339
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:55,921
There's plenty of guys at the Id
around the corner. It's a club.

340
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,381
You won't have trouble
meeting somebody there.

341
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,549
Thank you.

342
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,177
You can't miss it.
Look for the long line.

343
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,471
I need your credit card...

344
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:08,350
...for room incidentals,
long distance calls and so forth.

345
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,310
Credit card? Zip zap?

346
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,979
American Express, Visa,
MasterCard?

347
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,899
There you go. Thanks. All right.

348
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,317
Thank you.

349
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,486
Wait a minute!

350
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,743
You don't want this falling
into the wrong hands.

351
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,411
No.

352
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:33,917
Here's Justin Crawl. It's through
and it's covered by the goalie.

353
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,254
Yeah?

354
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,214
The conductor's credit card
turned up...

355
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:42,050
...in a Hollywood motel.
The van's out front.

356
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,510
Let's go.

357
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,348
You two.

358
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,021
Enjoy yourselves.

359
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:58,692
You, legs. You're in. Go on.

360
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,716
Where are you from?

361
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,261
- I'm foreign.
- You're what?

362
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,555
- I'm foreign.
- Really?

363
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,557
Easy, easy.

364
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,601
I've got a party to go to
and no one to take me.

365
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,186
I'll take you.

366
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:36,813
- You will?
- Yeah.

367
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,065
Okay. I'm going
to the little girls' room.

368
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,985
Wait right here.

369
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,903
I'll be right back.

370
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,572
I'll be right here.

371
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,468
Whatever it takes, right?

372
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,888
All's fair in love and war.

373
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,623
Can't see much on that.

374
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:39,501
Get this tape to the lab. Enhance it.

375
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,669
See if we can get a better look.

376
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,671
She looks nice.

377
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,299
Do you have any idea
where she went?

378
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:50,053
- I'll find her.
- She wanted to meet a man.

379
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:53,014
I suggested a club called
the Id around the corner.

380
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,351
Get the tape.

381
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:18,540
I've got a party to go to
and no one to take me.

382
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,834
Where is this party?

383
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:22,710
I don't know.

384
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,681
Whoa, you can't park there!

385
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,641
Back that out!

386
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:40,520
- No, you can't go in there.
- What's going on?!

387
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:59,205
- There's been a murder!
- No one leaves here! I mean, nobody!

388
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,378
There's always some action
in this part of town.

389
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,559
Blue-eyed blonde.

390
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:23,730
Black leggings, pink sweater, 5' 10"
tall. Who'd she leave with?

391
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:26,566
Blonde leaves with a guy
is hardly news around here.

392
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,735
Name the top attractions. No losers.

393
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:31,279
Assume he's socially adept.
He'll be helping her out.

394
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,531
A friendly guy, not an asshole.

395
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,408
I'm thinking.

396
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:38,369
- Robbie left with a blonde.
- That's him.

397
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:40,705
That's him.

398
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:43,583
Come on. Let me show you
the rest of the house.

399
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,586
I'm still sweaty from that place.

400
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:48,254
It's so crowded.

401
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:54,802
Like it?

402
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:57,263
Yes.

403
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:58,973
I feel like a shower.

404
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,142
You want one?

405
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,436
Tell you what.

406
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,104
I'm taking one.

407
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:07,023
You wanna take one later...

408
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:08,691
...no problem.

409
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,320
Take off your clothes.

410
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,657
I want to see you.

411
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,666
Very nice.

412
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,595
Take me back.

413
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,722
What are you talking about?

414
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,724
You know why we came here.

415
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:24,684
I've changed my mind.

416
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:27,312
All right. You said "no. "

417
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:30,189
It's duly noted. Come here.

418
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,399
I wanna go!

419
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,652
Too late. You're not leaving!
You're not!

420
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:40,325
- All right.
- That's better.

421
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:12,834
What's happening? Kills a girl
at the club, kills this guy.

422
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:16,087
I'd say she fits the definition
of a psychopath.

423
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:18,131
Nothing inhibits her.

424
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,050
No moral sense, no social structure.

425
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:25,430
She wasn't exactly smothered with a
mother's love or taught good manners.

426
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:27,390
I asked what was happening.

427
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,767
He did something, she was angry.

428
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,937
She'll kill if she's threatened
or if anyone gets in her way.

429
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,355
Of what?

430
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:35,815
Her life cycle.

431
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,151
I think she's trying to mate.

432
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,610
Reproduce.

433
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,154
Okay.

434
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:43,114
So why did she kill the girl?

435
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:45,116
Sexual competition.

436
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:46,868
She's hard on the competition.

437
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:48,494
Now she managed to mate.

438
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:52,790
Doesn't look like a success.
He's still got his pants on.

439
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,293
- She's frustrated.
- Who isn't?

440
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:58,129
What's her problem?
She was here with him.

441
00:45:58,338 --> 00:45:59,964
Maybe she rejected him.

442
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,091
She probably has special senses.

443
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:06,554
Rats can sense diseased or genetic
damage in their potential mates...

444
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,222
...so we can test his body...

445
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:13,019
...for hereditary diseases or defects
that would make him a loser...

446
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,520
...essentially.

447
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,022
Needles.

448
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:19,776
Maybe he was a doper,
or a diabetic.

449
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:22,862
Either way would make him
unacceptable. Excuse me.

450
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,199
All right.

451
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,703
Insulin. Diabetic.
There you have it.

452
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:33,581
She could have just walked out.
Why kill him?

453
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,917
He pissed her off.

454
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:38,586
Some men, when rejected,
get insistent.

455
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,422
- Put an APB out on his car.
- We have.

456
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,634
We'll go back to the motel.
I want to check it out.

457
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:47,887
More docile and controllable,
huh, Fitch?

458
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:04,987
- What do you think, Dan?
- What do I think?

459
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,574
I think she'd want to be alone now.

460
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:12,578
She won't come here with
all these cars outside.

461
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:15,748
You're assuming she could
find her way back here.

462
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,166
She could.

463
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,001
What is it?

464
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,547
Maybe menstrual blood.

465
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:26,092
If she's menstruating,
she can reproduce.

466
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,552
Yes, I know.

467
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,691
Shit.

468
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,698
Oh, Jesus.

469
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,158
Excuse me.

470
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:17,870
Call a paramedic! Anybody
got a phone?

471
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:26,295
If your commute takes you westbound
on the 10 freeway...

472
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:28,047
...expect an hour delay.

473
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:30,675
The drive will be slow to Malibu.

474
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,142
The video enhancement
is not that great.

475
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:42,520
How old do you think she is?
Twenty, 23?

476
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:46,983
Her reproductive system
should be fully developed.

477
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:49,235
Her biological clock must be
in hyperdrive.

478
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,403
She wants a baby.

479
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:53,322
If she has a child our problems
have just begun.

480
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:56,617
If her offspring is male and develops
at the same rate as Sil...

481
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:00,454
...it could reproduce in 6 months.

482
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,291
God knows how many females
it could impregnate.

483
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:05,960
Fitch.

484
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:10,589
When a predatory species
is introduced...

485
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:12,425
...into a closed ecological system...

486
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:15,678
...the extinction of the weaker species
is inevitable.

487
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,597
They found the murdered guy's BMW,
out of gas in Santa Monica.

488
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:20,057
What's her name?

489
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,435
- I don't know.
- Who are you?

490
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:26,731
She didn't have any ID.
I thought I'd make sure she was okay.

491
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,733
You think she's got insurance?

492
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:32,486
I don't know. Just put it on
my credit card for now.

493
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:36,657
And you don't know her name.
Guys like you are hard to find.

494
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:46,500
Get a lab workup on that, stat.

495
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:52,089
Get her up to x-ray.
I want an x-ray on this.

496
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,675
It looks like a scapula fracture.

497
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,811
Your shoulder wound.

498
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,983
What's going on here?

499
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:18,949
Doctor, we need you now.
A child burn victim just came in.

500
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,993
- What is going on here?
- Doctor, please.

501
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:23,788
Jesus Christ!
Did you see her shoulder?

502
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:26,040
Please. We need you immediately.

503
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,217
You're okay.

504
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,635
I'm okay.

505
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:40,387
I was sure you were
seriously injured.

506
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,056
I'm okay.

507
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,350
You are. It's a miracle.

508
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:46,352
Can we go?

509
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:49,313
Did the doctor say you could go?

510
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:50,731
Yes.

511
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,652
We'll send somebody over there.
Thanks a lot.

512
00:51:57,364 --> 00:52:01,867
Doctor over at Parkbay Hospital
called in with some weird story.

513
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:04,203
We should check it out.
It's a few miles away.

514
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:05,830
Laura...

515
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:08,374
...Press, take a car, check it out.

516
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,168
- Parkbay Hospital?
- Yeah, Parkbay.

517
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:14,713
She walked.

518
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:16,882
She walked.

519
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:19,885
She walked that way...

520
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,721
...not too long ago.

521
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,857
Got some fruit and cheese.

522
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:36,318
What is that?

523
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,237
You mean the hot tub?

524
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:40,406
A hot tub.

525
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,283
I love this place.

526
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:45,369
It's away from the traffic
and business and people.

527
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:48,372
Sometimes it feels like
you're not in L.A. anymore.

528
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,082
Here.

529
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:52,209
We'll immortalize the moment.

530
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,637
Look at the camera.

531
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:12,563
- This girl literally reformed her bones.
- It's her.

532
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:14,899
Who checked her in?

533
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,026
I don't know. Let's find out.

534
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:20,654
She had no insurance so this guy
put it on his own credit card.

535
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:24,909
Here's the file. John F. Carey.

536
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:29,788
You don't have a driver's license
or home address?

537
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:33,500
No, sir.
Just an imprint of his credit card.

538
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:36,545
Give us a printout
of what you've got.

539
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:38,088
No problem.

540
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,551
Some candy?

541
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,814
It's in the Palisades and
he's got a phone number.

542
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:59,526
Tell Fitch where we're headed,
and try to get John Carey on the line.

543
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:31,392
I'd better get the phone.

544
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:41,068
I've got his machine.
Should I leave a message?

545
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:42,569
Yeah.

546
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:46,198
Tell him he's about to copulate
with a creature from outer space.

547
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,076
- Copulate, huh?
- Yeah.

548
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:51,954
I like you.

549
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:53,455
I know.

550
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:00,629
It's not too soon for us
to be together.

551
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,966
No, it's not too soon.

552
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,469
You don't need these.

553
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,930
Hey, hey. That's a little fast.

554
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,653
What's the matter?

555
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:26,572
Take it easy.

556
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,909
Just relax.

557
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:33,912
There's plenty of time.

558
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:43,922
What is it?

559
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,635
I think someone's at the door.

560
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:50,054
Don't go.

561
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,890
Please. I want a baby.

562
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,434
What?! Excuse me?

563
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,446
Let's go around the side.

564
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:51,990
Outside.

565
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:52,611
- What happened?
- A squirrel! A fucking squirrel!

566
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:55,280
- She was here.
- Yeah, she was.

567
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,658
I wanna make sure
she's not still here.

568
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:28,063
Perhaps we should check the body
for evidence that they've had sex.

569
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:37,823
I used to be scared
at the sight of blood.

570
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,492
Now I guess I'm getting used to it.

571
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:43,245
Oh, yes.

572
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:11,815
- Help me, please!
- Oh, my God. What's the matter?

573
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:14,651
We found this in the living room.

574
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:17,821
She liked him.

575
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:21,366
Well, not enough.

576
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:25,162
Can't see any more on that than
we did on the video monitor.

577
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:27,623
He didn't get a good picture of her.

578
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:30,876
There's no evidence of semen
in the hot tub water.

579
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:32,878
Maybe she took it with.

580
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:35,213
So she probably
hasn't managed to mate.

581
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:38,508
- We interrupted her.
- Yes, I think we did.

582
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:40,719
Give me something I can use.

583
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,056
What have you
come up with lately, Fitch?

584
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:51,229
She's not scared of us.

585
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:52,898
That's for sure.

586
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:58,278
We're all beat.

587
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:00,489
We'll go back to the hotel and rest.

588
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:02,949
Tomorrow night...

589
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,077
...we'll go back to the club.

590
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:07,913
- Stake it out.
- Stake it out.

591
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,250
She's not stupid.

592
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:13,960
She won't repeat herself.

593
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:17,422
There's no point going there.
It provided a poor specimen.

594
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:18,632
I'm not sure.

595
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,593
She's been in the city two days.
It's what she knows.

596
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:23,470
I'd rather try the club...

597
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:28,100
...than sit at the command center
reminiscing about how close we got.

598
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:44,282
She would make one excellent
biological weapon.

599
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:48,453
If someone thought we were some
kind of galactic weed that would...

600
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:50,664
...spread through the universe.

601
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:54,000
So what you're saying is that...

602
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:56,628
...she's the cure and
we're the disease.

603
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:58,630
That's well said.

604
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,258
"Baker, Laura.

605
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:05,178
1735 Meander Drive,
Simi Valley, California. "

606
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:06,805
That's you, right?

607
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,307
Last time I checked.

608
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,685
What do you do for kicks out there?

609
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,939
Pine for guys like you.

610
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:18,316
That's what I thought.

611
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:40,589
So anyone hungry?

612
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:45,010
No, thanks. I'm beat.
I'm gonna try to get some sleep.

613
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:47,429
- Good night.
- Yeah. Night.

614
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:51,892
- I'll have something to eat with you.
- Thanks, Dan.

615
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:56,998
- Do you ever have nightmares?
- Yes.

616
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:59,918
Please untie my hands.

617
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:03,129
- I wouldn't hurt you. Please.
- I have them.

618
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:08,176
I think they tell me who I am.

619
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,762
Why are you doing this to me?

620
01:04:13,474 --> 01:04:15,267
I don't know why I'm here.

621
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:17,936
I don't know who I am, who sent me.

622
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:21,773
- Do you?
- No!

623
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:28,280
- Why do you think you're here?
- I don't know.

624
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:30,907
Please let me go.

625
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:33,493
Please. Please, let me go.

626
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,789
I wouldn't hurt you.

627
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:39,708
I promise.

628
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:42,043
- I wouldn't hurt you.
- Yes, you would.

629
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:44,379
You just don't know it yet.

630
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:47,632
No, I wouldn't!

631
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,217
Please!

632
01:04:50,803 --> 01:04:53,221
My hands are hurting me.

633
01:04:57,476 --> 01:04:58,810
Thank you.

634
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:00,979
Thank you.

635
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,195
Oh, my God!

636
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:26,922
Oh, my God, no!

637
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:30,634
No! No!

638
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:31,713
Laura and Press,
they like each other.

639
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:34,007
They just don't like to show
how they feel.

640
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:35,550
What?

641
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:38,970
Laura and Press,
they like each other.

642
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:41,097
Yeah, whatever you say, Dan.

643
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:44,476
Look, it's really smoky in here.
I'm gonna go outside, get some air.

644
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:49,022
Think I'll lie down in the van. Have a
rest. This is a complete waste of time.

645
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:53,735
Get a feeling you're on
a wild goose chase?

646
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,320
Yeah.

647
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:57,697
Excuse me.

648
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:01,219
Get out of here. This is my trashcan.

649
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:13,731
It's you.

650
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:22,073
Hey!

651
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:25,034
She's here! Hey!

652
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:33,251
- Dan. Is that her?
- Yeah.

653
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:34,627
Here.

654
01:09:41,093 --> 01:09:42,677
Get in the van.

655
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:46,556
Everybody get in the van!

656
01:09:55,107 --> 01:09:58,109
They're heading into the hills.
We'll need the helicopters.

657
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:14,167
We're going up Nichols Canyon. One
of you try to block her at Mulholland.

658
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:32,644
Watch it!

659
01:11:34,206 --> 01:11:35,915
Oh, my God!

660
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:14,787
We blocked the road.
We've gotta tell the press something.

661
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:17,874
Tell them what you want,
just don't tell them the truth.

662
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:21,336
I don't buy her showing up at
the club. It's too damn convenient.

663
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:24,380
Seeing is believing or
don't you trust your eyes?

664
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:26,758
Get back! Get all these people back!

665
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:30,011
Fitch. Fitch. It doesn't feel right.

666
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:31,596
Sir!

667
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:35,475
We found a severed thumb in
one of the doors that got ripped off.

668
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:38,895
- Let me see that.
- She may have caught it in the door.

669
01:12:39,104 --> 01:12:41,105
Get to the lab, see if it's hers.

670
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:44,567
- It'll be genetically identifiable.
- It's all over, everyone.

671
01:12:44,735 --> 01:12:47,070
Tomorrow you can go back
to your lives.

672
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:49,614
Congratulations on a job well done.

673
01:12:53,118 --> 01:12:55,119
Just like that, huh, Fitch?

674
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:57,288
I don't think so.

675
01:13:08,008 --> 01:13:11,636
Leave me a message.
And Frank, I'm going to dinner.

676
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:14,472
Where are we meeting?
Bye, sweetie.

677
01:13:17,142 --> 01:13:18,351
Waiter.

678
01:13:19,853 --> 01:13:21,312
Well, I guess we won.

679
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:26,692
- We won, science lost.
- I didn't think we'd get her this way.

680
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:29,779
- Not that easy.
- You sound like you'll miss her.

681
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:31,114
I guess I will.

682
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:33,699
I think I respected her.

683
01:13:36,161 --> 01:13:40,498
I know this was a hellish job, but I
really enjoyed working with you three.

684
01:13:40,707 --> 01:13:43,793
And since Uncle Sam is buying,
let's have another round.

685
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:44,961
Waiter!

686
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:47,004
I don't- I don't drink.

687
01:13:47,339 --> 01:13:48,965
Don't worry, Dan. Tonight you will.

688
01:13:51,009 --> 01:13:52,510
You wanna dance?

689
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:54,804
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you.

690
01:13:57,975 --> 01:14:00,143
- All right.
- Okay.

691
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:20,830
I know you don't have a family.
Do you have a girlfriend in New York?

692
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:25,334
I guess I've had a few, but
they don't hang around very long.

693
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:28,337
I guess I keep too many secrets.

694
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:30,381
You wanna share one with me?

695
01:14:31,341 --> 01:14:32,717
- Right now?
- Yeah.

696
01:14:38,223 --> 01:14:41,642
I know what you do,
and it doesn't scare me.

697
01:14:41,852 --> 01:14:44,061
- Really?
- No.

698
01:14:44,521 --> 01:14:46,272
Well, it does most people.

699
01:14:50,944 --> 01:14:53,362
I wouldn't wanna
never see you again.

700
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:01,913
- Hey.
- What are you-?

701
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:06,000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I thought you were somebody else.

702
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:07,585
I'm sorry.

703
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:10,755
You okay?

704
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:13,549
I thought it was Sil.
I saw the blonde hair.

705
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:15,259
She's dead, Press.

706
01:15:15,427 --> 01:15:17,970
The tests on the thumb
proved it was her.

707
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:21,390
You got your test and I got my gut.
I just don't buy it.

708
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:26,103
I think as long as you feel
she's out there, you got a mission.

709
01:15:26,271 --> 01:15:28,773
Maybe you don't want
this job to be over.

710
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:31,692
Well, maybe not. So what?

711
01:15:35,113 --> 01:15:36,781
Thanks for the dance.

712
01:15:51,255 --> 01:15:52,463
Good night.

713
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:00,763
What do you call this?

714
01:16:01,139 --> 01:16:03,307
It's called a Long Island Ice Tea.

715
01:16:04,601 --> 01:16:05,935
It's got tea in it?

716
01:16:06,937 --> 01:16:08,145
Nope.

717
01:16:25,622 --> 01:16:27,623
Smells nice, can I try some?

718
01:16:28,458 --> 01:16:29,959
Help yourself.

719
01:16:35,173 --> 01:16:36,966
Does it work on your boyfriend?

720
01:16:37,175 --> 01:16:39,135
Yeah. As a repellent.

721
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:46,475
I don't know. I think he's in remarkably
good shape for a man his age.

722
01:16:58,155 --> 01:17:00,239
One Long Island Ice Tea.

723
01:17:02,492 --> 01:17:04,744
I like these cups of tea.

724
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:09,040
- What?
- That's great.

725
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:16,922
Hey, give me one of those.

726
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:20,384
I like these cups of tea, man.

727
01:17:21,261 --> 01:17:23,554
You guys, I'm tired.
I'm gonna go to bed.

728
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:28,100
So?

729
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:31,062
She's going to bed.

730
01:17:31,271 --> 01:17:32,605
I guess.

731
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:36,275
She still...

732
01:17:37,235 --> 01:17:39,028
...wants to see you though.

733
01:17:42,741 --> 01:17:45,242
Maybe I'll go find out
if you're right about that.

734
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:13,521
I'd hate to be in here
during an earthquake.

735
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,022
Yeah.

736
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,024
What floor do you want?

737
01:18:17,442 --> 01:18:19,110
Ten, please.

738
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:31,038
I like your perfume.

739
01:18:31,623 --> 01:18:32,832
You do?

740
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:36,711
- Thank you.
- Excuse me. I get out here.

741
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:42,133
Good night.

742
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:21,130
- Hi.
- Hi.

743
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:40,357
Did you want something?

744
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:43,778
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

745
01:20:29,366 --> 01:20:30,991
Housekeeping.

746
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:35,371
Dan. Dan.

747
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:38,707
Those two over there.
Bet they like unusual men like us.

748
01:20:40,043 --> 01:20:41,919
Women think I'm strange.

749
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:43,796
I don't feel well.

750
01:20:44,297 --> 01:20:45,881
Don't be silly.

751
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:48,467
Just go over there and talk to them.

752
01:20:48,718 --> 01:20:51,887
I have to go. And I think
you should leave with me, okay?

753
01:20:54,432 --> 01:20:56,851
I'm gonna stay for a while, actually.

754
01:20:59,437 --> 01:21:00,646
Okay.

755
01:21:01,731 --> 01:21:03,148
I'll see you tomorrow.

756
01:21:06,152 --> 01:21:08,028
Housekeeping.

757
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:23,836
- Hi.
- Hi.

758
01:21:24,004 --> 01:21:26,422
I was sitting over there, wondering...

759
01:21:26,631 --> 01:21:30,175
...what two intelligent, glamorous
women were doing without dates.

760
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:31,927
My name's Stephen Arden.

761
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:34,263
I teach anthropology at Harvard.

762
01:21:34,472 --> 01:21:36,098
- I lived in Boston once.
- Yeah?

763
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:37,516
For a year.

764
01:21:37,684 --> 01:21:40,603
- Froze my butt off.
- It's cold in Boston.

765
01:21:40,812 --> 01:21:43,230
This is Bill and Tony.
I forget your name.

766
01:21:48,945 --> 01:21:50,446
Cute little socks.

767
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:53,616
Stand up.

768
01:22:33,573 --> 01:22:35,157
How'd you get in here?

769
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:37,701
- I stole the key.
- What?

770
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:40,996
I saw you downstairs, but
you were with all those people.

771
01:22:41,831 --> 01:22:43,540
So I thought I'd come up and wait.

772
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:49,505
This kind of thing doesn't
usually happen to me.

773
01:22:51,341 --> 01:22:52,883
I just want to be with you.

774
01:23:03,478 --> 01:23:05,062
Oh, yes.

775
01:23:19,369 --> 01:23:20,786
What about protection?

776
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:18,177
She's here. She's here.

777
01:24:47,207 --> 01:24:48,665
Press?

778
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,709
Someone's at the door.

779
01:24:52,754 --> 01:24:53,754
Who's there?

780
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:55,130
Press, Laura.

781
01:24:55,298 --> 01:24:57,341
It's Dan. I gotta talk to you.

782
01:24:57,717 --> 01:25:00,177
Christ, what does he want?

783
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:12,981
- What's the problem, Dan?
- I just got this terrible feeling.

784
01:25:13,191 --> 01:25:16,318
I get this strange thought,
this image of Sil with Arden.

785
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:17,945
Sil's next door to Arden, Press.

786
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:20,656
No, no, no. She's dead, Dan.

787
01:25:21,032 --> 01:25:24,701
I went to his room and there's
someone in there with him.

788
01:25:24,869 --> 01:25:28,413
- Did you knock on the door?
- Yes, but I don't know what she'll do.

789
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:32,459
They're making a lot of noise.
They're having sex.

790
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:34,837
I know it's Sil, I know it!

791
01:25:35,547 --> 01:25:36,547
Okay.

792
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:39,091
I believe you. I'll get dressed.

793
01:25:54,941 --> 01:25:56,775
I enjoyed that immensely.

794
01:26:15,295 --> 01:26:17,921
- I felt it.
- What?

795
01:26:21,467 --> 01:26:22,759
It's started.

796
01:26:23,761 --> 01:26:25,387
What's started?

797
01:26:25,555 --> 01:26:26,597
Life.

798
01:26:27,891 --> 01:26:29,933
Oh, my darling girl.

799
01:26:30,476 --> 01:26:34,646
In some cultures, women believe
they know the moment of conception-

800
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:36,523
Don't you believe me? Feel.

801
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,614
Holy shit!

802
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:51,538
I hope you're right about this, Dan.

803
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:06,303
- She's headed for the basement.
- We'll take the stairs.

804
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:07,888
Laura, come with me!

805
01:27:08,097 --> 01:27:09,306
Come on!

806
01:27:12,268 --> 01:27:16,438
If she's pregnant, we gotta
get to her before she gives birth.

807
01:27:16,606 --> 01:27:19,524
God. We don't know what
we're dealing with here.

808
01:27:19,692 --> 01:27:23,570
She could have a dozen babies.
She could lay 1000 eggs!

809
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:27,074
Oh, God. Did you see Arden?

810
01:27:27,283 --> 01:27:28,992
Yeah, I did, that poor bastard.

811
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:33,830
We can trap her. The fire door opens
from the inside at the bottom exit.

812
01:27:34,123 --> 01:27:35,123
Then what?

813
01:27:37,502 --> 01:27:38,752
Holy shit.

814
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:42,047
- Oh, my God.
- The bitch went through a steel door!

815
01:27:42,382 --> 01:27:45,175
Fitch! Dan! We're in the garage!
She got past us!

816
01:27:56,562 --> 01:27:59,106
- You saw her?
- She was gone before we got here.

817
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:00,983
- Here.
- You saw her!

818
01:28:01,192 --> 01:28:03,193
- Look at the door!
- Which way did she go?

819
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:05,779
- Where's Press?
- He took off down that tunnel.

820
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:23,797
She kills if she feels threatened.

821
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:26,133
She kills if she feels threatened.

822
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:50,407
She must've come through here.

823
01:29:12,889 --> 01:29:14,931
She went down here.
There's no other way.

824
01:29:15,099 --> 01:29:16,558
Yeah, she's down there.

825
01:29:17,810 --> 01:29:19,061
Let's go.

826
01:29:19,562 --> 01:29:21,897
Stand back, I'll clear it out.

827
01:30:15,118 --> 01:30:17,285
Which way did she go, Dan?

828
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:20,455
- I don't know.
- What?

829
01:30:20,706 --> 01:30:22,666
I'm not sure. She's here.

830
01:30:22,875 --> 01:30:27,796
Think. You're supposed to have some
extrasensory power! Which way?

831
01:30:28,589 --> 01:30:32,843
- Which way did she go, Dan?
- I don't know! I don't know!

832
01:30:36,013 --> 01:30:38,849
- I think she went that way.
- That's good enough for me.

833
01:30:39,016 --> 01:30:40,851
You think she went that way?

834
01:30:42,145 --> 01:30:44,855
You don't fucking know, don't you?
You don't fucking know.

835
01:30:45,022 --> 01:30:47,441
I'll go this way. You come with me.

836
01:30:47,650 --> 01:30:49,776
- Come with me, Dan!
- Fitch.

837
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:53,280
I think she went this way.

838
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:12,507
Dan?

839
01:31:16,053 --> 01:31:17,387
Dan?

840
01:31:54,634 --> 01:31:55,884
Fitch. Fitch.

841
01:31:57,428 --> 01:31:58,845
Dan?

842
01:32:01,474 --> 01:32:02,849
What happened?

843
01:32:12,109 --> 01:32:13,443
I can feel her.

844
01:32:14,111 --> 01:32:15,445
She's that way.

845
01:32:16,197 --> 01:32:17,781
She's that way.

846
01:32:21,786 --> 01:32:24,454
I never thought
I'd want to kill something.

847
01:32:24,830 --> 01:32:26,498
Never thought I'd want to.

848
01:33:01,909 --> 01:33:04,911
It's this way. It's back here.

849
01:33:36,068 --> 01:33:38,278
Hey, she went in here.

850
01:33:43,534 --> 01:33:45,952
This must have opened up
during the earthquake.

851
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:49,039
Okay, stand back.

852
01:35:05,074 --> 01:35:06,282
Is that oil?

853
01:35:06,575 --> 01:35:07,909
Looks like it.

854
01:35:15,584 --> 01:35:18,795
I'm going back there to see
if I can flush her out.

855
01:35:18,963 --> 01:35:21,798
If she comes back through here,
let her have it.

856
01:35:37,064 --> 01:35:38,982
Dan. Dan!

857
01:36:38,709 --> 01:36:41,878
- Dan, what is it?
- I don't know.

858
01:36:42,046 --> 01:36:43,379
I don't know.

859
01:37:44,108 --> 01:37:45,400
Dan.

860
01:38:06,881 --> 01:38:08,464
Okay.

861
01:38:10,384 --> 01:38:11,676
It's okay.

862
01:38:13,304 --> 01:38:14,596
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

863
01:38:15,431 --> 01:38:16,681
You come here.

864
01:38:18,976 --> 01:38:20,977
Come on. I got you.

865
01:38:26,025 --> 01:38:28,359
Press, something's happened
to Dan!

866
01:38:29,361 --> 01:38:30,820
You okay?

867
01:38:33,741 --> 01:38:35,074
Shit!

868
01:38:37,202 --> 01:38:38,703
Dan?

869
01:38:39,705 --> 01:38:41,372
Dan?

870
01:38:42,207 --> 01:38:43,541
I'm stuck!

871
01:38:48,589 --> 01:38:51,174
I need your help! I'm stuck!

872
01:39:20,204 --> 01:39:22,205
Dan, you gotta hang on!

873
01:39:29,505 --> 01:39:31,130
Press!

874
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:36,511
Dan, keep on.

875
01:39:50,651 --> 01:39:53,236
Press!

876
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:44,412
Hang on, Dan!

877
01:40:46,749 --> 01:40:47,957
Hang on!

878
01:40:49,334 --> 01:40:50,334
I got you.

879
01:40:52,087 --> 01:40:54,088
I got you, Dan. Hang on.

880
01:40:54,798 --> 01:40:56,174
Shit.

881
01:41:03,766 --> 01:41:05,266
Hang on!

882
01:41:07,311 --> 01:41:08,478
Hang on, Dan!

883
01:41:12,775 --> 01:41:14,692
Get rid of her, Press!

884
01:41:19,198 --> 01:41:20,406
Duck your head.

885
01:41:21,992 --> 01:41:24,285
Let go, you motherfucker.

886
01:41:26,872 --> 01:41:29,540
- I got you. Hold on, I got you.
- Shit.

887
01:41:35,172 --> 01:41:36,798
I thought I was dead.

888
01:41:40,302 --> 01:41:43,513
I thought you'd drank your
last Long Island Ice Tea.

889
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:45,056
Yeah, I thought we all had.

890
01:41:47,434 --> 01:41:49,644
Hey, you okay?

891
01:41:50,145 --> 01:41:51,395
Yeah, I'm okay.

892
01:41:52,564 --> 01:41:54,482
My pants are a little messed up.

893
01:41:55,067 --> 01:41:56,400
But I'm okay.

894
01:41:58,821 --> 01:42:01,322
She was half us,
half something else.

895
01:42:02,157 --> 01:42:04,325
I wonder which was
the predatory half.

896
01:42:05,661 --> 01:42:07,245
The dead half.

897
01:42:07,579 --> 01:42:09,080
Let's get the hell out of here.

898
01:42:53,584 --> 01:42:56,961
I never thought I'd be so happy
to be back in a sewer.
