57
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:09,030
说我是怪诞的人 说我很奇怪
I'm the weird one, I'm the strange one.

58
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,450
为什么？因为我有感觉吗？
Why? Because I have feelings?

59
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,120
因为我有感应吗？
Because I feel?

60
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,120
门外有人
There's someone at the door.

61
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,380
不必理会 不管是谁 一小时后他会再来
I won't answer that. Whoever it is can come back at the end of the hour.

62
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,630
这是找我的

67
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,860
这样…
Well...

68
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,790
我们来这里的原因应是相同的
I guess we all must be here for the same reason...

69
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,370
不管原因是什么
whatever that is.

我是史丹
I'm Dan Smithson...

71
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,250
我不知道为何会来这里
and I don't know why I'm here either.

72
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,880
但是… 他们说是重要的事需要我帮忙 所以我来了
But they said they needed me and it was important, so I came.

73
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,130
你干什么的？
What do you do, Dan?

74
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,800
我是心灵感应者
I'm an empath.

75
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,850
有时他们让我看人们做过的可怕事
Sometimes they show me awful things people have done.

76
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,480
我尝试给他们解释原因
I try to tell them why they did it.

77
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,820
你有何资格做这种工作？
What qualifies you for that?

78
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,650
只是因为我有感应
I feel things deeply, that's all.

79
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,740
我现在有何感觉？
What am I feeling now?

80
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,000
你想相信没有任何事能影响你
You wanna believe that nothing affects you...

81
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,170
你是天不怕 地不怕

82
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,920
但你充满好奇心
But you're curious...

83
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,920

90
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,450
证明有灾难发生了

91
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,870
你的专长究竟是什么？

What exactly might they be?

94
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,880
人们不想提起的问题
The kind people don't usually like to talk about.

95
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,720
你狩猎人 对吗？

是的
I guess so.

00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,860
共有两则回复

118
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:53,620
第一则是沼气的强力催化剂
The first message turned out to be a superior catalyst for methane.

119
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,120
我们现在有能力

120
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,540
用沼气提炼出无限能源

121
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:02,710
因此我们相信他们是友善的

第二则是DNA的新排序
The second message turned out to be a new sequence of DNA...

123
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,840
还有充足的指示使我们能重新组合DNA
with friendly instructions on how to combine it with ours.

124
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:15,050
那些是技术数据 有问题便问贝博士
Here's some technical data. Get feedback from Dr. Baker.

125
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,390

两个储存在液态氮中
Two were stored in liquid nitrogen.

133
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,740
我们让一个继续生长
And we allowed one to grow.

134
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,750
它的代名是『西儿』
Its code name is "Sil."

135
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,750
两小时后是这样

139
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,590
一星期后
A week.

140
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,430
- 是个女孩 - 是的
- It's a girl. - Yes.

141
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:01,440
我们决定制造女孩 因为她较易驾驭
We decided to make it female so it would be more docile...

142
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,650
- 较易控制 - 驾驭和控制？
- and controllable. - More docile and controllable, huh?

143
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,030
出去走走
Well, I guess you guys don't get out much.

144
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,820
那是她出生后一个月
That's her 1 month after she was born.

145
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,990
你把她关在那里？
So you kept her caged in there?

146
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,620
把她隔离比较安全
It was safer to keep her isolated.

147
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,960
她不喜欢这样
She didn't like being locked up.

148
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,960
她不喜欢单独一人
She didn't like being alone.

149
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,710
对吗？
Didn't she?

150
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,880
她在隐藏身体里的一些东西
She's hiding something. Something inside.

151
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,970
对
You're right, Dan.

152
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:38,390
这是她出生后三个月 看清楚
This is three months after she was born. Watch carefully.

153
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,230
那是什么？
What the hell was that?

154
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:43,900
倒带看看
Back the tape up.

155
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,730
看她的眼睛
Watch her eyes.

156
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,740
眼睛迅速移动 她在做梦
Rapid eye movement. She's dreaming.

157
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:58,330
- 是恐怖的噩梦 - 是焦虑不安的反应
- She's having horrible nightmares. - It's some kind of anxiety reaction.

158
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,120
这也令我不安
Got me a little anxious.

159
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:03,330
还令研究队伍有点不安
It made the research team a little anxious too...

160
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:06,920
因此我们决定终止实验
so the decision was made to terminate the experiment...

161
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:10,050
先研究我们在应付些什么
to run more research to see what we were dealing with.

162
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,180
你们打算用毒气杀死她？
You were going to gas her?

163
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,390
我们已经决定了
That was the decision.

164
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,730
这令你很难过
It makes you feel mad.

165
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,810
要杀死她你很难过 对吗？
You feel mad that you had to kill her, don't you?

166
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,360
我不知道
I don't know.

167
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,030
好
Yes.

168
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:45,380
昨天在盐湖城的火车上发现一个露宿者的尸体
Yesterday the body of a transient was found in a boxcar near Salt Lake City.

169
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,340
初步的DNA测试发现
Preliminary DNA tests conclude...

170
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:51,760
他是被我们所创造的西儿所杀
he was killed by our creation, by our Sil.

171
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,470
有发现其他尸体吗？
Found any other bodies?

172
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,180
- 暂时未有 - 你会的
- Not yet. - You will.

173
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,060
她是捕猎者
She's a predator.

174
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,970
她的眼睛在前方
Her eyes are in front...

175
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:03,150
所以她能辨别与猎物的距离
so she can judge the distance to her prey.

176
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,480
对
That's right.

177
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,070
你在哪里学的？
Where'd you learn that?

178
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:09,490
我看电视的探索频道
I saw it on the Discovery Channel.

179
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,990
我看过那电视节目
I caught that show myself.

180
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,160
- 伦诺克斯 先生 - 嗯？
- Mr. Lennox. - Yeah?

181
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:17,790
作为…
As the...

182
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,960
非科学家 你清楚事情的始末吗？
non-scientist amongst us, are you clear about what's going on?

183
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,120
清楚
I think so.

184
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,750
你们取得外太空的方程式
You created a monster...

185
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,960
创造了一头怪物
with a formula you got from outer space.

186
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:35,260
她逃走了 你想我们找寻和杀了她
The damn thing got away. Now you want us to hunt it down and kill it.

187
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,260
接近吗？
Now, is that pretty close?

188
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,180
是的
I guess.

189
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,640
你不想我们…
You don't want us...

190
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,940
活捉她作为研究之用吗？
to capture her alive so that we can study her?

191
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,690
这绝对是寻找和毁灭的行动
Laura, I think this is strictly a search and destroy operation.

192
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:55,410
向我求助的人都想消灭他们的目标
Nobody ever asked me to find anything they didn't want dead.

193
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,950
我很遗撼
I'm sorry for you.

194
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,950
那么…
Yeah, well...

195
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,620
谢谢
Thank you, Dan.

196
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,130
我为她感到遗撼
I'm sorry for her.

197
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,960
请注意
May I have your attention, please?

198
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:14,390
欢迎来到洛杉矶 这是沙漠之星的终点站
Welcome to Los Angeles. This is the terminal stop for the Desert Star.

199
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,140
请各位乘客下车
All passengers please disembark.

200
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,700
洛杉矶

201
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,890
有些坏事发生了
Something bad happened here.

202
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,060
- 没错 - 她的颈被压碎了
- No shit. - Crushed her larynx.

203
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,930
她很害怕
She was afraid.

204
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,560
很惶恐 惊慌
She's scared, frightened.

205
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:47,650
还很饥饿 她饥不择食
Hungry too. She's been eating like a horse.

206
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:50,480
她肯定没有节食
Our girl is definitely not on a diet.

207
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,950
她为某些原因储存能量
She's storing calories for something.

208
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,570
有头绪吗？
Any ideas?

209
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,410
我的…
Oh, my...

210
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,910
哇 那是
Well, that's...

211
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,420
它看来像…
That looks like some sort of...

212
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,460
蛹 或是卵囊
chrysalis. Some kind of cocoon.

213
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,090
我们在找巨型蚕虫吗？
What are we looking for, a giant moth?

214
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,510
若那是卵囊
If that is a cocoon...

215
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,220
她现在已经完全成长了
she'll be fully-grown now.

216
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:19,890
她可能因此逃脱了
Maybe that's how she got by our people.

217
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,720
因为我们的人在找小孩
They were looking for a child.

218
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,600
她是小孩
She is a child.

219
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,650
这里很臭 我到外面去
It stinks in here. I'm going outside.

220
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:38,580
快找那售票员的身份证和信用卡的号码
Get the conductors' ID and credit card numbers on your computer.

221
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,830
这些东西都不在列车上
There's no sign of them on the train.

222
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,960
- 假设她拿走了吧 - 我会安排的了
- Let's assume she took them. - I'll see to that.

223
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,830
受威胁时她会杀人
She kills if she's threatened.

224
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,460
她没有半点自责
And she has no remorse about it. None.

225
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:52,010
洛杉矶最适合她
Of course, Los Angeles is perfect for her.

226
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,800
这是充满未来的城市
It's a city of the future.

227
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:55,220
什么事物都可行
Anything goes.

228
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:58,180
人口不断流动 每个人都是陌生人
Totally mobile population. Everyone's a stranger.

229
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,430
没有什么忌讳 没有什么不能够接受
Very little is taboo or unacceptable.

230
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,640
她做什么都没有人留意
Whatever she does, no one will notice her.

231
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,020
任何事情都是 所以…
Well, whatever. So...

232
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,980
洛杉矶是我们战斗
Los Angeles is where the battle will be fought...

233
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,690
和获胜的地方
and won.

234
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,220
你很漂亮
You look very pretty.

235
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,520
你有百元钞票吗？
Do you have a hundred?

236
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,270
有了
Here we are.

237
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:52,190
小心看管你的钱 不是所有人都像我那么诚实
Be more careful with your money. Not everybody's as honest as me.

238
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,700
你由外地来的吗？
Are you foreign?

239
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,200
你会说英语吗？
Do you speak English?

240
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:05,710
- 会 - 拿着
- Yes. - Here. You keep this.

241
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,290
让我拿这个
Here, let me take this.

242
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,840
保重
Be careful here.

243
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:13,380
好
Yes.

244
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,140
小心
Watch your step.

245
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,570
我们的实验室访客基地一号…
Our laboratory, Visitor Base One...

246
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:40,240
正搬到大学现在没用的病毒研究实验室
is being moved to some empty virus research labs at the university.

247
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:43,950
他们在搬运仪器 八时便能开始运作
They're moving our equipment now. It'll be operational by 8:00.

248
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:47,420
你们去登记房间 十五分种后在这里集合
Check into your rooms. Everyone out front in 15 minutes. We'll go over.

249
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,090
我们要做什么？
What will we do?

250
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,590
研究火车上的证据
Process the evidence from the train.

251
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,300
我们能用那生物的DNA繁殖他吗？
Could we try growing this creature with its own DNA?

252
00:28:55,510 --> 00:29:00,640
我们制造一个不含人类DNA的样本 研究他的弱点
We do a version without ours this time and investigate its vulnerabilities.

253
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:01,930
这提议很好
That'd be good.

254
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,640
- 我也想知道他的弱点 - 合情合理
- Then I could know how it feels. - Makes sense.

255
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:07,600
他的人类身体可能只是掩饰
This human life form could be a mask. Without the camouflage...

256
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:10,770
对 至少我们会知道在对付什么
You're right. At least we'd know what we were dealing with.

257
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,790
沙哈兰汽车酒店

258
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:12,000
几个笨蛋刚走了 我有客人
A couple of bozos just ran out. I got a customer.

259
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:15,510
- 有什么可以帮你？- 我想要一间房间
- Yes, young lady. Can I help you? - I want a room.

260
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,550
加上税后 六十二元 这是密月套房的价钱
62, including tax. That'll just about cover the Honeymoon Suite.

261
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,700
你好 你经常来的吗？
Hi. Come here often?

262
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,250
你的星座是什么？
What's your sign?

263
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,430
厌倦了黑发吗？
Tired of brunette?

264
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,340
改变吧
Change.

265
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,890
改变头发的颜色
Change the color of your hair.

266
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,390
『头发色素』
Color-Tress.

267
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,940
我放大倍数了
I've increased the magnification.

268
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:22,280
我注入细胞后就会形成外星DNA
When I pierce the cell, the foreign DNA will be introduced.

269
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,550
可恶
Shit!

270
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,970
摄影机坏了
The camera's gone down.

271
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,220
不好意思
Excuse me.

272
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,600
你们有后备的吗？
Do you have a replacement camera?

273
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:45,430
有 但更换需要一点时间
We do, but it'll take time for the technician to replace it.

274
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,310
我的实验室经常发生这种事 很简单
No. This happens in my lab all the time. It's simple to replace it.

275
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,230
你能做到吗？
You saying you can do it?

276
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,190
当然 但我需要别人帮忙
Sure I can. I just need somebody to give me a hand.

277
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,610
技术人员不能入内 这项计划是保密的
I don't want technicians in there. This is classified.

278
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,070
我来帮忙
I'll do it.

279
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,830
我来帮忙
I'll do it.

280
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:04,950
- 行动派的人 我喜欢 - 那就是我
- Man of action, I like that. - That's me.

281

你能帮我除掉那颗吗？

282
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,780
把摄影机给我
Give me the camera.

283
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:58,220
有点不对劲
Something's... Something's wrong.

284
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,980
天啊 他已经开始了

288
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,490
她注入了细胞
She must have penetrated the cell.

289
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:20,530
- 可恶 - 那是什么？

290

他掉了螺栓

- 快找那螺栓 快把它盖上 - 我正在找

他们听到吗？
Can they hear me in there?

293

罗娜 皮斯

- get the top on, then I'll let you out. - Where'd it go?

295

- 它掉进铁丝网里 - 你能拿起它吗？
- It fell through the grate. - Can you lift it up?

296
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:47,020
- 我拿不开它 - 不能拿开它
- It's not gonna move. - This isn't going anywhere.

I have to do it!

322
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,460
两分种内杀死他
You have two minutes to kill it.

323
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,880
截断气喉用来做喷火器
Disconnect the gas line. Use it as a flamethrower.

324
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,560

330
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,720
他死了 快开门

331
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,680
让他们出来
It's dead, Fitch. Let them out.

332
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,480
天啊 他还未死
Oh, God, it's not dead.

333
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,990
- 见鬼 - 我们该做什么？

- 让他们出来 - 我不能这么做
- Let them out. - I can't do that.

337
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,580
- 我得遵守规则 - 什么规则？
- I have to follow protocol! - What protocol?!

338
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,580
做这个实验的规则
The protocols by which we're doing this!

339
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:10,460
你没有对他们说过
You didn't tell them that before they went in.

340
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:13,130
- 让他们出来 - 12 11 10…

345
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,010
- 我没有其他选择 - 好
- I had no choice. - Yeah, sure.

346
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:28,600
规则是要发生问题时烧掉一切
The protocol is to burn the room if anything went wrong!

347
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,420
我在哪里可以找到男人？
Where's a good place to find a man?

348
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:55,670
在转角一间叫艾特的夜总会
There's plenty of guys at the Id around the corner. It's a club.

349
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,220
你一定会找到男人

352

353
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:08,310
用来付房间杂费 长途电话费等
for room incidentals, long distance calls and so forth.

354
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,270
信用卡？让我刷刷
Credit card? Zip zap?

355
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,940
像运通 诸如此类

Wait a minute!

359
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:26,700
你不会想它落入坏人的手上
You don't want this falling into the wrong hands.

360
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,370
不
No.

361
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:33,880
这是柯士甸 他突破防守 但被龙门接到了
Here's Justin Crawl. It's through and it's covered by the goalie.

362
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,170
什么
Yeah?

363
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,170
有人使用那售票员的信用卡
The conductor's credit card turned up...

364
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,010
在好莱坞 货车已经预备好
in a Hollywood motel. The van's out front.

365
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,470

长腿姐姐 你进去吧 来吧

369
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,680
你由哪里来？
Where are you from?

370
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:26,220
- 外地 - 什么？
- I'm foreign. - You're what?

371
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,520
- 我由外地来的 - 真的吗？
- I'm foreign. - Really?

372
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,520
放松
Easy, easy.

373
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:33,560
我要去一个派对 但没有人送我去
I've got a party to go to and no one to take me.

374
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,150

我在这里等你
I'll be right here.

380
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,430
不择手段 对吗？
Whatever it takes, right?

381
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,850
爱与战争中人人平等
All's fair in love and war.

382
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,590
不是很清楚
Can't see much on that.

383
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,470
拿录影带到实验室弄清楚
Get this tape to the lab. Enhance it.

384
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,630
看我们能否看到她

386
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,260
你知道她到哪里去了吗？
Do you have any idea where she went?

387
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:50,020
- 我会找到她 - 她想找男人
- I'll find her. - She wanted to meet a man.

388
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:52,980
我提议她到转角的艾特夜总会
I suggested a club called the Id around the corner.

389
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,320
拿走那录影带
Get the tape.

390
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,510
我要去派对 但没有人送我
I've got a party to go to and no one to take me.

391
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,800

Where is this party?

392
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,680
我不知道
I don't know.

393
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,650
你不能在这里停车
Whoa, you can't park there!

394
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,610
快退出去
Back that out!

395
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:40,490
- 你不能进去 - 发生什么事？
- No, you can't go in there. - What's going on?!

396
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,170
- 有谋杀案 - 所有人都不准离开
- There's been a murder! - No one leaves here! I mean, nobody!

397
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,340
镇上总是有各种行动的
There's always some action in this part of town.

398
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:19,530
蓝眼的金发女郎
Blue-eyed blonde.

399
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:23,700
穿黑色长裤 粉红色毛衣 身高五尺十寸 她和谁离开？
Black leggings, pink sweater, 5' 10" tall. Who'd she leave with?

400
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:26,530
金发女郎和男人一起并非大新闻
Blonde leaves with a guy is hardly news around here.

401
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,700
说出最流行的人 不要说出没出息的人
Name the top attractions. No losers.

402
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:31,250
他是帮助她
Assume he's socially adept. He'll be helping her out.

403
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,500
是个友善的人 不是浑蛋
A friendly guy, not an asshole.

404
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:35,380
我在想了
I'm thinking.

405
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,340
- 罗比和一名金发女郎离开 - 是他了

406
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,670

407
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:43,550
让你看看我的家
Come on. Let me show you the rest of the house.

408
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,550
我还在出汉
I'm still sweaty from that place.

409
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:48,220
那里太挤迫了
It's so crowded.

410
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,770
喜欢吗？
Like it?

411
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,230
喜欢
Yes.

412
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,940
我想享受一个花洒浴
I feel like a shower.

413
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,110
你想吗？
You want one?

414
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,400
这样吧
Tell you what.

415
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,070
我会享受花洒浴
I'm taking one.

416
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,990
你稍后也想来一个…
You wanna take one later...

417
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,660

你知道我们为何来这里
You know why we came here.

424
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:24,660
我改变主意了
I've changed my mind.

425
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:27,280

What's happening? Kills a girl at the club, kills this guy.

431
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:16,060
她符合精神变态的定义
I'd say she fits the definition of a psychopath.

432
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:18,110

433
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:21,030
没有道德观或社会结构观念
No moral sense, no social structure.

434
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:25,410
也没有母爱
She wasn't exactly smothered with a mother's love or taught good manners.

435

Of what?

439
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:35,790
她的生命周期
Her life cycle.

440
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,130
她想寻找配偶
I think she's trying to mate.

好的
Okay.

443
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,090
她为何要杀那女孩？
So why did she kill the girl?

444
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,090
性别竞争
Sexual competition.

445
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:46,840
她的手段很强硬
She's hard on the competition.

446
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:48,470
她找到了配偶
Now she managed to mate.

447
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,770
看来不是很成功 他还穿着裤子
Doesn't look like a success. He's still got his pants on.

448
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:55,270
- 她很沮丧 - 谁不是？
- She's frustrated. - Who isn't?

449
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,110
怎么一回事？她已跟他来到这里
What's her problem? She was here with him.

450
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,940
可能她拒绝了他
Maybe she rejected him.

451
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:02,070
她可能有特别的感觉
She probably has special senses.

452
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,530
老鼠能感觉到配偶有疾病或遗传问题

我们可以对他进行测试
so we can test his body...

454
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:13,000
检查他有没有遗传病或缺撼 让他不能做她的…
for hereditary diseases or defects that would make him a loser...

455
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,500

他可能是瘾君子或糖尿病病人

458
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:22,840
任何一种都是不能接受的 不好意思
Either way would make him unacceptable. Excuse me.

459
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:26,180
好了
All right.

460
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:30,680
是胰岛素 他有糖尿病 就是它了

461
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:33,560
她可以离开 为何要杀他？
She could have just walked out. Why kill him?

462

他惹怒她了
He pissed her off.

463

We'll go back to the motel. I want to check it out.

466
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:47,870
较易驾驭和控制吗？
More docile and controllable, huh, Fitch?

467
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,970
- 你有什么意见？- 我有什么意见？
- What do you think, Dan? - What do I think?

468
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,550
她现在想单独一人

那些车在外面 她不会来
She won't come here with all these cars outside.

470
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:15,730
你认为她懂得回来这里？
You're assuming she could find her way back here.

471
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:17,150
对
She could.

472
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:18,980
这是什么？
What is it?

473
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:22,530
可能是月经的血
Maybe menstrual blood.

474
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,070
若有月经 她便能繁殖

我知道

00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:51,950
我喜欢你
I like you.

558
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,450
我知道
I know.

559
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:00,620
我们在一起不是太快
It's not too soon for us to be together.

560
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:03,960
不 不是太快
No, it's not too soon.

561
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,460
你不需要这些
You don't need these.

562
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,930
这样有点太快
Hey, hey. That's a little fast.

563
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,650
什么事？
What's the matter?

564
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:26,570
别紧张
Take it easy.

565
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:30,910
放松点
Just relax.

566
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:33,910
还有很多时间
There's plenty of time.

567
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:43,920
什么事？
What is it?

568
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:48,630
有人来了
I think someone's at the door.

569
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,050
不要走
Don't go.

570
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,890
求求你 我想生个小孩
Please. I want a baby.

571
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:55,430
什么？你说什么？
What?! Excuse me?

572
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:07,440
往旁边看看
Let's go around the side.

573
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:51,990
外边
Outside.

574
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:52,740
- 什么事？- 可恶的松鼠
- What happened? - A squirrel! A fucking squirrel!

575
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:55,410
- 她来过这里 - 对
- She was here. - Yeah, she was.

576
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:57,790
我想肯定她现在不在
I wanna make sure she's not still here.

577
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:28,190
我们该检查他有否进行过性行为
Perhaps we should check the body for evidence that they've had sex.

578
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:37,950
我从前很怕血
I used to be scared at the sight of blood.

579
00:59:38,830 --> 00:59:40,620
现在已经习惯了
Now I guess I'm getting used to it.

580
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:43,370
没错
Oh, yes.

581
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:11,950
- 救我 - 什么事？
- Help me, please! - Oh, my God. What's the matter?

582
01:00:12,990 --> 01:00:14,780
我们在客厅找到的
We found this in the living room.

583
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:17,950
她喜欢他
She liked him.

584
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:21,500
但并不足够
Well, not enough.

585
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:25,290
跟录影带一样看不到她的样子
Can't see any more on that than we did on the video monitor.

586
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:27,750
他没有为她拍摄好的照片
He didn't get a good picture of her.

587
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:31,010
水中没有精液
There's no evidence of semen in the hot tub water.

588
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:33,010
可能她带走了
Maybe she took it with.

589
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:35,340
她可能还未交配
So she probably hasn't managed to mate.

590
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:38,640
- 我们打扰了她 - 对
- We interrupted her. - Yes, I think we did.

591
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:40,850
说些有用的资料
Give me something I can use.

592
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:44,190
你最近有什么感应？
What have you come up with lately, Fitch?

593
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,360
她并不害怕我们
She's not scared of us.

594
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:53,030
当然
That's for sure.

595
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:58,410
我们都累了
We're all beat.

596
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:00,620
回酒店休息吧
We'll go back to the hotel and rest.

597
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:03,080
明晚…
Tomorrow night...

598
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,210
我们再回到那夜总会
we'll go back to the club.

599
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:08,050
- 完成一切 - 完成一切
- Stake it out. - Stake it out.

600
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:12,380
她不是蠢才
She's not stupid.

601
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:14,090
她不会重复做过的事
She won't repeat herself.

602
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:17,560
没有原因让她再到那儿 那儿提供了个坏样版
There's no point going there. It provided a poor specimen.

603
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:18,810
我不肯定
I'm not sure.

604
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:21,730
她来这里只有两天 她只知道这些
She's been in the city two days. It's what she knows.

605
01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:23,600
我宁可到那夜总会…
I'd rather try the club...

606
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:28,230
总比坐在指挥中心回想我们差点成功的例子
than sit at the command center reminiscing about how close we got.

607
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:44,420
她会是很好的生物武器
She would make one excellent biological weapon.

608
01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:48,590
可能有人认为我们是星际的杂草
If someone thought we were some kind of galactic weed that would...

609
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,800
会遍布宇宙
spread through the universe.

610
01:01:51,970 --> 01:01:54,130
你是说…
So what you're saying is that...

611
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:56,760
她是解药 我们是病菌
she's the cure and we're the disease.

612
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:58,760
说得好
That's well said.

613
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:01,390
贝罗娜
"Baker, Laura.

614
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:05,310
加州斯敏谷 曼达道1735号
1735 Meander Drive, Simi Valley, California."

615
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:06,940
是你 对吧
That's you, right?

616
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:09,440
我上次查看时是的
Last time I checked.

617
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:11,820
在这儿有什么消遣？
What do you do for kicks out there?

618
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:16,070
怀念你这种人
Pine for guys like you.

619
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:18,450
我也是这样想
That's what I thought.

620
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:40,720
有人肚子饿吗？
So anyone hungry?

621
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:45,150
不 谢谢 我很累 要去睡了
No, thanks. I'm beat. I'm gonna try to get some sleep.

622
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,560
- 晚安 - 晚安
- Good night. - Yeah. Night.

623
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:52,030
- 我和你去吃东西吧 - 谢谢
- I'll have something to eat with you. - Thanks, Dan.

624
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:57,140
- 你有试过做噩梦吗？- 是的
- Do you ever have nightmares? - Yes.

625
01:03:57,970 --> 01:04:00,060
请你放开我
Please untie my hands.

626
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:03,270
- 我不会伤害你 - 我做了噩梦
- I wouldn't hurt you. Please. - I have them.

627
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:08,320
噩梦告诉我 我是谁
I think they tell me who I am.

628
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:10,900
你为何这样做？
Why are you doing this to me?

629
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:15,410
我不知道自己为何在这里
I don't know why I'm here.

630
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:18,070
我不知道自己是谁 谁派我来这里
I don't know who I am, who sent me.

631
01:04:19,950 --> 01:04:21,910
- 你知道吗？- 不
- Do you? - No!

632
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:28,420
- 你为何在这里？- 我不知道
- Why do you think you're here? - I don't know.

633
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:31,050
请你放了我
Please let me go.

634
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,630
请你放了我
Please. Please, let me go.

635
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:37,930
我不会伤害你
I wouldn't hurt you.

636
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:39,850
我保证
I promise.

637
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:42,180
- 我不会伤害你 - 你会的
- I wouldn't hurt you. - Yes, you would.

638
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:44,520
你还未知道
You just don't know it yet.

639
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:47,770
我不会
No, I wouldn't!

640
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:49,360
求求你
Please!

641
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:53,360
我的手很痛
My hands are hurting me.

642
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:58,950
谢谢
Thank you.

643
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:01,120
谢谢
Thank you.

644
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:09,340
天啊
Oh, my God!

645
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,060
天啊 不要
Oh, my God, no!

646
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,770
不 不
No! No!

647
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:39,360
危险 高电压

648
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:31,860
罗娜和皮斯喜欢对方
Laura and Press, they like each other.

649
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,150
但他们没有表现出来
They just don't like to show how they feel.

650
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:35,690
什么
What?

651
01:07:36,610 --> 01:07:39,120
罗娜和皮斯 喜欢对方
Laura and Press, they like each other.

652
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:41,240
你说什么都好
Yeah, whatever you say, Dan.

653
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:44,620
这里烟雾弥漫 我到外面去
Look, it's really smoky in here. I'm gonna go outside, get some air.

654
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:49,170
我会在货车上躺下休息 简直在浪费时间
Think I'll lie down in the van. Have a rest. This is a complete waste of time.

655
01:07:52,050 --> 01:07:53,880
你觉得我们在浪费时间吗？
Get a feeling you're on a wild goose chase?

656
01:07:54,090 --> 01:07:55,470
是的
Yeah.

657
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:57,840
不好意思
Excuse me.

658
01:08:58,570 --> 01:09:01,370
拿出去 这是我的垃圾桶
Get out of here. This is my trashcan.

659
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:13,880
是你
It's you.

660
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:22,220
嗨
Hey!

661
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:25,180
她在这里
She's here! Hey!

662
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,400
- 是她吗？- 是她
- Dan. Is that her? - Yeah.

663
01:09:33,610 --> 01:09:34,780
这里
Here.

664
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,830
上车
Get in the van.

665
01:09:44,830 --> 01:09:46,710
上车
Everybody get in the van!

666
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:58,260
他们往山丘那边去了 我们需要直升机
They're heading into the hills. We'll need the helicopters.

667
01:10:09,850 --> 01:10:14,320
他们往尼古斯峡谷去 在麦可伦那里拦截她
We're going up Nichols Canyon. One of you try to block her at Mulholland.

668
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:32,800
看那
Watch it!

669
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,070
天啊
Oh, my God!

670
01:12:11,230 --> 01:12:14,940
我们封锁了道路 得告诉新闻界些什么
We blocked the road. We've gotta tell the press something.

671
01:12:15,190 --> 01:12:18,030
你要说什么便说什么 但不能说真相
Tell them what you want, just don't tell them the truth.

672
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:21,490
我不相信她会在夜总会出现 太简单了
I don't buy her showing up at the club. It's too damn convenient.

673
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:24,530
看到便要相信 你不相信自己的眼睛吗？
Seeing is believing or don't you trust your eyes?

674
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:26,910
所有人退后
Get back! Get all these people back!

675
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:30,170
有点不对劲
Fitch. Fitch. It doesn't feel right.

676
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:31,750
长官
Sir!

677
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:35,630
我们在门外发现一只掉下了的拇指
We found a severed thumb in one of the doors that got ripped off.

678
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:39,050
- 让我看看 - 她可能被大门弄伤
- Let me see that. - She may have caught it in the door.

679
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:41,260
拿去实验室化验 看看是否她的
Get to the lab, see if it's hers.

680
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:44,720
- 透过基因可以知道那拇指属谁 - 一切都完了
- It'll be genetically identifiable. - It's all over, everyone.

681
01:12:44,930 --> 01:12:47,220
明天起一切回复原状
Tomorrow you can go back to your lives.

682
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,770
恭喜你们完成工作
Congratulations on a job well done.

683
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:55,280
就这样？
Just like that, huh, Fitch?

684
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:57,440
不是这样
I don't think so.

685
01:13:08,210 --> 01:13:11,790
请留下口讯 法兰 我会和你吃晚餐
Leave me a message. And Frank, I'm going to dinner.

686
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,630
我们在哪里见面？再见
Where are we meeting? Bye, sweetie.

687
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:18,510
侍应生
Waiter.

688
01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:21,470
我们赢了
Well, I guess we won.

689
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:26,850
- 我们赢了 科学输了 - 这样我们不算赢
- We won, science lost. - I didn't think we'd get her this way.

690
01:13:27,850 --> 01:13:29,940
- 没这么容易 - 你会挂念她吗？
- Not that easy. - You sound like you'll miss her.

691
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:31,270
会
I guess I will.

692
01:13:32,230 --> 01:13:33,860
我会尊敬她
I think I respected her.

693
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:40,660
虽然这项工作很讨厌 但我很享受
I know this was a hellish job, but I really enjoyed working with you three.

694
01:13:40,910 --> 01:13:43,780
既然由国家付帐 我们再来喝酒
And since Uncle Sam is buying, let's have another round.

695
01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:44,990
侍应生
Waiter!

696
01:13:45,330 --> 01:13:47,160
我不喝酒
I don't... I don't drink.

697
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:49,120
今晚你要喝
Don't worry, Dan. Tonight you will.

698
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:52,670
要跳舞吗？
You wanna dance?

699
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,960
- 谁？我？- 对 你
- Who, me? - Yeah, you.

700
01:13:58,170 --> 01:14:00,300
- 好吧 - 好吧
- All right. - Okay.

701
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:20,990
我知道你没有妻室 但你在纽约有女朋友吗？
I know you don't have a family. Do you have a girlfriend in New York?

702
01:14:22,070 --> 01:14:25,490
以前有一些 但没维持很久
I guess I've had a few, but they don't hang around very long.

703
01:14:26,370 --> 01:14:28,500
我有太多秘密了
I guess I keep too many secrets.

704
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,540
跟我分享一个
You wanna share one with me?

705
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:32,880
- 现在？- 是的
- Right now? - Yeah.

706
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:41,800
我知道你做什么 不会吓倒我
I know what you do, and it doesn't scare me.

707
01:14:42,050 --> 01:14:44,220
- 真的吗？- 当然
- Really? - No.

708
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:46,430
但吓倒很多人
Well, it does most people.

709
01:14:51,150 --> 01:14:53,520
我不想再也看不到你
I wouldn't wanna never see you again.

710
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:02,070
- 嗨 - 你是…？
- Hey. - What are you...?

711
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:06,160
对不起 我认错人了
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I thought you were somebody else.

712
01:15:06,370 --> 01:15:07,750
对不起
I'm sorry.

713
01:15:09,710 --> 01:15:10,920
你没事吧？
You okay?

714
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,710
我以为是西儿 我看到她的金发
I thought it was Sil. I saw the blonde hair.

715
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:15,420
她死了
She's dead, Press.

716
01:15:15,630 --> 01:15:18,130
那拇指证实是她的
The tests on the thumb proved it was her.

717
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:21,550
你相信测试 但我不相信
You got your test and I got my gut. I just don't buy it.

718
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:26,260
只要你感觉她在那里 你便有任务
I think as long as you feel she's out there, you got a mission.

719
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:28,930
可能你不想工作结束
Maybe you don't want this job to be over.

720
01:15:29,730 --> 01:15:31,850
可能不是 那又怎样？
Well, maybe not. So what?

721
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:36,940
感谢你与我跳舞
Thanks for the dance.

722
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:52,630
晚安
Good night.

723
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:00,930
这是什么？
What do you call this?

724
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:03,470
这叫长岛冰茶
It's called a Long Island Ice Tea.

725
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,100
里面有红茶的吗？
It's got tea in it?

726
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:08,310
没有
Nope.

727
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:27,790
很香 我可以试试吗？
Smells nice, can I try some?

728
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:30,120
随你喜欢
Help yourself.

729
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:37,130
对你的男朋友有效吗？
Does it work on your boyfriend?

730
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:39,300
令他厌恶
Yeah. As a repellent.

731
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:46,640
这个年龄 他算不错了
I don't know. I think he's in remarkably good shape for a man his age.

732
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:00,400
一杯长岛冰茶
One Long Island Ice Tea.

733
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:04,910
我喜欢这种红茶
I like these cups of tea.

734
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:09,200
- 什么？- 太好了
- What? - That's great.

735
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:17,090
给我一杯
Hey, give me one of those.

736
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:20,550
我喜欢这些红茶
I like these cups of tea, man.

737
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,720
我很累 要睡觉了
You guys, I'm tired. I'm gonna go to bed.

738
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:28,270
那么？
So?

739
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:31,230
她要睡觉了
She's going to bed.

740
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,770
是的
I guess.

741
01:17:34,810 --> 01:17:36,440
但她还是…
She still...

742
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,190
想再见你
wants to see you though.

743
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:45,410
我去看看你是否说得对
Maybe I'll go find out if you're right about that.

744
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:13,690
我最怕地震时在这里
I'd hate to be in here during an earthquake.

745
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:15,190
嗯
Yeah.

746
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:17,190
你要到哪一层？
What floor do you want?

747
01:18:17,650 --> 01:18:19,280
十楼 谢谢
Ten, please.

748
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:31,210
我喜欢你的香水
I like your perfume.

749
01:18:31,830 --> 01:18:33,000
真的吗？
You do?

750
01:18:33,670 --> 01:18:36,880
- 谢谢 - 不好意思 我到了

01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:40,530
你想要什么吗？
Did you want something?

755
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:43,950
- 可能吧 - 可能？
- Maybe. - Maybe?

756
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:31,160
我来整里房间

Dan. Dan.

758
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:38,880
那两个女孩定是喜欢我们这种不平凡的男人
Those two over there. Bet they like unusual men like us.

759
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:42,090
女人都认为我很奇怪
Women think I'm strange.

760
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:43,970
我不舒服
I don't feel well.

761
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:46,050
别傻了
Don't be silly.

762
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,640
到那里跟她们聊聊
Just go over there and talk to them.

763
01:20:48,930 --> 01:20:52,060
我走了 你也该走了 知道吗？
I have to go. And I think you should leave with me, okay?

764
01:20:54,650 --> 01:20:57,020
我想多留一会
I'm gonna stay for a while, actually.

765
01:20:59,650 --> 01:21:00,820
好的
Okay.

766
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:03,320

01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:24,010
- 你好 - 你好
- Hi. - Hi.

769
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:26,590
我坐在那边想
I was sitting over there, wondering...

770
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:30,350
这么聪明漂亮的女人为何会没有约会？
what two intelligent, glamorous women were doing without dates.

771
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,100
我是艾斯蒂

772

01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:37,690
为期一年
For a year.

775
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:40,780
- 冷得要命 - 很冷
- Froze my butt off. - It's cold in Boston.

776
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:43,400
这是标和东尼 我忘了你的名字

778
01:21:52,370 --> 01:21:53,790
站起来
Stand up.

779
01:22:33,790 --> 01:22:35,330
你怎样走进来？
How'd you get in here?

780
01:22:35,710 --> 01:22:37,880
- 我偷了钥匙 - 什么？
- I stole the key. - What?

781
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:41,170
我在楼下看到你
I saw you downstairs, but you were with all those people.

782
01:22:42,050 --> 01:22:43,720
所以便来等你
So I thought I'd come up and wait.

783
01:22:47,390 --> 01:22:49,680
我通常不会遇上这种事
This kind of thing doesn't usually happen to me.

784
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:53,060
我想跟你在一起
I just want to be with you.

785
01:23:03,690 --> 01:23:05,240
哦 好
Oh, yes.

786
01:23:19,590 --> 01:23:20,960
安全措施呢？
What about protection?

787
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,360
她在这里
She's here. She's here.

788
01:24:47,430 --> 01:24:48,850
皮斯？
Press?

789
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:50,890
有人在门外
Someone's at the door.

790
01:24:52,850 --> 01:24:53,850

Who's there?

791
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:55,310
皮斯 罗娜

792
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,520
我是丹 我想跟你谈谈
It's Dan. I gotta talk to you.

793
01:24:57,940 --> 01:25:00,360
他想怎样？
Christ, what does he want?

794
01:25:10,330 --> 01:25:13,160
- 什么事？- 我有可怕的感觉
- What's the problem, Dan? - I just got this terrible feeling.

795
01:25:13,410 --> 01:25:16,500
我有奇怪的感觉 看到西儿和艾的影像
I get this strange thought, this image of Sil with Arden.

796
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:18,130
西儿和艾在一起
Sil's next door with Arden, Press.

797
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:20,840
不 她死了

798
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:24,880
我走到他的房间 有人跟他在一起
I went to his room and there's someone in there with him.

799
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:28,590
- 你有敲门吗？- 有 但我不知道她有何反应
- Did you knock on the door? - Yes, but I don't know what she'll do.

800
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:32,640
他们很吵 在进行性行为
They're making a lot of noise. They're having sex.

801
01:25:32,890 --> 01:25:35,020
我知道那是西儿
I know it's Sil, I know it!

802
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:36,640
好的
Okay.

803
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:39,060
我相信你 等我穿衣服

804
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:56,960
我非常享受
I enjoyed that immensely.

805
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:18,100
- 我感觉到 - 什么？
- I felt it. - What?

806
01:26:21,690 --> 01:26:22,940
开始了
It's started.

807
01:26:23,980 --> 01:26:25,570
什么？
What's started?

808
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:26,780
生命
Life.

809
01:26:28,110 --> 01:26:30,120
我亲爱的女孩
Oh, my darling girl.

810
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:34,830
有些女人相信自己能感觉到受孕
In some cultures, women believe they know the moment of conception...

811
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:36,710
你不相信？你来感觉吧
Don't you believe me? Feel.

812
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:43,800
可恶
Holy shit!

813
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,720
希望你是对的
I hope you're right about this, Dan.

814
01:27:04,110 --> 01:27:06,490
- 她往地下室去了 - 我们走楼梯
- She's headed for the basement. - We'll take the stairs.

815
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:08,070
罗娜 跟我来
Laura, come with me!

816
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:09,490
来吧
Come on!

817
01:27:12,490 --> 01:27:16,620
若她怀孕了 我们得在她生育前找到她
If she's pregnant, we gotta get to her before she gives birth.

818
01:27:16,830 --> 01:27:19,710
我们不知道那究竟是什么生物
God. We don't know what we're dealing with here.

819
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:23,750
她可能一次能生十二个小孩或者一千粒卵
She could have a dozen babies. She could lay 1000 eggs!

820
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:27,260
你看到艾吗？
Oh, God. Did you see Arden?

821
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:29,180
看到 可怜的蠢才
Yeah, I did, that poor bastard.

822
01:27:29,390 --> 01:27:33,970
我们能抓住她 地下出口的防烟门由里面打开了
We can trap her. The fire door opens from the inside at the bottom exit.

823
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:35,230
然后怎样？
Then what?

824
01:27:37,730 --> 01:27:38,940
可恶
Holy shit.

825
01:27:39,150 --> 01:27:42,230
- 我的天 - 她穿过钢门逃走了
- Oh, my God. - The bitch went through a steel door!

826
01:27:42,610 --> 01:27:45,360
费舒 丹 我们在停车厂 她避开了我们
Fitch! Dan! We're in the garage! She got past us!

827
01:27:56,790 --> 01:27:59,290
- 你看到她吗？- 我们来到时她已经走了
- You saw her? - She was gone before we got here.

828
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:01,170
- 这儿 - 你看到她
- Here. - You saw her!

829
01:28:01,420 --> 01:28:03,380
- 看那门 - 她往哪里去了？
- Look at the door! - Which way did she go?

830
01:28:03,630 --> 01:28:05,970
- 皮斯在哪里？- 他到隧道去了
- Where's Press? - He took off down that tunnel.

831
01:28:21,020 --> 01:28:23,980
受威胁时她会杀人
She kills if she feels threatened.

832
01:28:24,190 --> 01:28:26,320
受威胁时她会杀人
She kills if she feels threatened.

833
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:50,590
她一定来过这里
She must've come through here.

834
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:15,120
她进去了 这儿没别的路
She went down here. There's no other way.

835
01:29:15,330 --> 01:29:16,750
对 她进去了
Yeah, she's down there.

836
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:19,250
走吧
Let's go.

837
01:29:19,790 --> 01:29:22,090
退后 让我清除障碍
Stand back, I'll clear it out.

838
01:30:15,350 --> 01:30:17,480
丹 她到哪里去了？
Which way did she go, Dan?

839
01:30:18,770 --> 01:30:20,650
- 我不知道 - 什么
- I don't know. - What?

840
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:22,860
我不肯定
I'm not sure. She's here.

841
01:30:23,110 --> 01:30:27,990
想一想 你该有第六感 哪一边？
Think. You're supposed to have some extrasensory power! Which way?

842
01:30:28,820 --> 01:30:33,030
- 她往哪里去了？- 我不知道
- Which way did she go, Dan? - I don't know! I don't know!

843
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:39,040
- 那边 - 这已经足够了
- I think she went that way. - That's good enough for me.

844
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:41,040
你认为她到哪边去了？
You think she went that way?

845
01:30:42,380 --> 01:30:45,050
你不是确实知道的 对吧？
You don't fucking know, don't you? You don't fucking know.

846
01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:47,630
我到这边 你跟我来
I'll go this way. You come with me.

847
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:49,970
- 丹 跟我来 - 费奇
- Come with me, Dan! - Fitch.

848
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:53,470
她该到了这边
I think she went this way.

849
01:31:11,370 --> 01:31:12,700
丹
Dan?

850
01:31:16,290 --> 01:31:17,580
丹？
Dan?

851
01:31:54,870 --> 01:31:56,080
费奇 费奇
Fitch. Fitch.

852
01:31:57,660 --> 01:31:59,040
丹
Dan?

853
01:32:01,710 --> 01:32:03,040
什么事？
What happened?

854
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:13,640
我感应到她
I can feel her.

855
01:32:14,350 --> 01:32:15,640
她在那边
She's that way.

856
01:32:16,430 --> 01:32:17,980
她在那边
She's that way.

857
01:32:22,020 --> 01:32:24,650
我没想到自己会想杀人
I never thought I'd want to kill something.

858
01:32:25,070 --> 01:32:26,690
从未想过
Never thought I'd want to.

859
01:33:02,150 --> 01:33:05,110
在这边 回到这里
It's this way. It's back here.

860
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:38,480
她走进去了
Hey, she went in here.

861
01:33:43,770 --> 01:33:46,150
这是地震造成的
This must have opened up during the earthquake.

862
01:33:47,530 --> 01:33:49,240
好 退后
Okay, stand back.

863
01:35:05,310 --> 01:35:06,480
是石油吗？
Is that oil?

864
01:35:06,820 --> 01:35:08,110
看来是
Looks like it.

865
01:35:15,830 --> 01:35:19,000
我回去看看能否赶她出来
I'm going back there to see if I can flush her out.

866
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:22,000
若她走来这里 便攻击她
If she comes back through here, let her have it.

867
01:35:37,310 --> 01:35:39,180
丹 丹
Dan. Dan!

868
01:36:38,950 --> 01:36:42,080
- 这是什么？- 我不知道
- Dan, what is it? - I don't know.

869
01:36:42,290 --> 01:36:43,580
我不知道
I don't know.

870
01:37:44,350 --> 01:37:45,600

877
01:38:29,610 --> 01:38:31,030
你没事吧？
You okay?

878
01:38:33,990 --> 01:38:35,280
可恶
Shit!

879
01:38:37,450 --> 01:38:38,910
丹
Dan?

880
01:38:39,950 --> 01:38:41,580
丹？
Dan?

881
01:38:42,460 --> 01:38:43,750
我被卡住

I need your help! I'm stuck!

883
01:39:20,450 --> 01:39:22,410

01:39:50,900 --> 01:39:53,450
皮斯
Press!

887
01:40:43,370 --> 01:40:44,620
丹 支持下去
Hang on, Dan!

888
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,170
支持下去
Hang on!

889
01:40:49,420 --> 01:40:50,420
我抓住你了
I got you.

890
01:40:52,340 --> 01:40:54,300
我抓住你了 支持下去
I got you, Dan. Hang on.

891
01:40:55,050 --> 01:40:56,390
可恶
Shit.

01:41:04,020 --> 01:41:05,480
坚持住
Hang on!

893

坚持住 丹
Hang on, Dan!

894
01:41:13,030 --> 01:41:14,910
干掉她
Get rid of her, Press!

895
01:41:19,450 --> 01:41:20,620
低下头
Duck your head.

896
01:41:22,250 --> 01:41:24,500
混蛋 再见
Let go, you motherfucker.

897
01:41:27,130 --> 01:41:29,750
- 我抓住你了 - 见鬼
- I got you. Hold on, I got you. - Shit.

898
01:41:35,430 --> 01:41:37,010
我以为死定了
I thought I was dead.

899
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:43,730
我以为你喝了最后的长岛冰茶
I thought you'd drank your last Long Island Ice Tea.

900
01:41:43,930 --> 01:41:45,270
彼此彼此
Yeah, I thought we all had.

901
01:41:47,690 --> 01:41:49,860
你没事吧？
Hey, you okay?

902
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:51,610
我很好
Yeah, I'm okay.

903
01:41:52,820 --> 01:41:54,700
我的裤子一团糟
My pants are a little messed up.

904
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:56,610
但我没事
But I'm okay.

905
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:01,540
她一半是人 一半是不知名生物
She was half us, half something else.

906
01:42:02,410 --> 01:42:04,540
我想知道哪一半是捕猎性的一半
I wonder which was the predatory half.

907
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:07,460
死掉的一半
The dead half.

908
01:42:07,830 --> 01:42:09,290
离开这里吧
Let's get the hell out of here.

909
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:57,180
我没想过会这么高兴回到污水道
I never thought I'd be so happy to be back in a sewer.
