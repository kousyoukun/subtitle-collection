1
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,486
I'm sorry.

2
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,905
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

3
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,460
Sir, she's breaking out!

4
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,367
- Go! Go!
- What are we looking for?

5
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,837
She jumped over the fence!

6
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,956
A couple of trains came through here
about the time she escaped.

7
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:22,376
Do you think she could have
gotten this far in that time?

8
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,086
Is she that fast?

9
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,172
She is that fast.

10
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,217
And this too.

11
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,220
- $3.10.
- Three dollars and ten cents?

12
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,263
Right.

13
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,060
- Your change.
- Thank you.

14
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:22,937
Can I help you?

15
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,357
The total is $17.95.

16
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,862
Here's your card.

17
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,700
Are you gonna buy those?

18
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,048
Have a nice trip.

19
00:09:56,638 --> 00:10:01,267
It's brown tweed bag, like a duffel.
Do you see it anywhere?

20
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,768
Sir, it's not here.

21
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,937
The porter said
he put it on the cart.

22
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,147
This is the cart.
There's no bag here.

23
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:32,840
Authorities said
<i>it was the largest earthquake to strike--</i>

24
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,009
<i>He's riding Greased Lightning.</i>

25
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,428
<i>Whoa! That was Shorty Kincaid.</i>

26
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,391
Enjoy the view.

27
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:15,007
Excuse me.

28
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,774
<i>We shouldn't be seen together.</i>

29
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:35,527
<i>Father hasn't been dead long.</i>
<i>Do you think Arlen suspects?</i>

30
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:38,906
No. It's not
<i>too soon for us to be together.</i>

31
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,118
Tickets, please.

32
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,414
Are you traveling by yourself?

33
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,083
You're 12?

34
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,754
Someone meeting you
in Los Angeles?

35
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,591
We'll say you're 11.
Then you only pay half price.

36
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,073
Our little girl did this?

37
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,699
She's not a little girl.

38
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:26,662
DNA typing and material found in
those wounds proves it was her.

39
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:30,833
She could be anywhere. Chicago,
Las Vegas, Los Angeles, anywhere.

40
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,334
We should stop the trains.

41
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:36,380
And have the railroad and police
ask questions we can't answer?

42
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,551
We'll put key personnel at
every stop along these lines.

43
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,011
I want a team to track her.

44
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:44,471
Hunt her down.

45
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,308
- Good morning, Jill.
- Hello.

46
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:53,063
-Thanks for taking care of my cat.
-We'll take good care of him.

47
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,023
I won't be gone very long.

48
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,817
Take care.

49
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,445
Bye-bye.

50
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,489
Are you still having
problems with the people at work?

51
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,658
They point their finger
at me saying...

52
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:09,079
...I'm the weird one,
I'm the strange one.

53
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,498
Why? Because I have feelings?

54
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,167
Because I feel?

55
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:17,754
There's someone at the door.

56
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:23,427
I won't answer that. Whoever it is
can come back at the end of the hour.

57
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,679
That's for me.

58
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,184
Sorry to interrupt.
We need your help, Dan.

59
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,853
I know. Uh....

60
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,063
Gotta go.

61
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,732
Mr. Fitch will be with you all
in just a moment.

62
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,906
Well....

63
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,827
I guess we all must be here
for the same reason...

64
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,412
...whatever that is.

65
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,122
I'm Dan Smithson...

66
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,293
...and I don't know why
I'm here either.

67
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:05,922
But they said they needed me and
it was important, so I came.

68
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,216
What do you do, Dan?

69
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,468
I....

70
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:11,845
I'm an empath.

71
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:17,893
Sometimes they show me awful things
people have done.

72
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,521
I try to tell them why they did it.

73
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,857
What qualifies you for that?

74
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,693
I feel things deeply, that's all.

75
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,782
What am I feeling now?

76
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,039
You wanna believe that
nothing affects you...

77
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,210
...that you're not afraid of anything.

78
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:45,962
But you're curious...

79
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,965
...just like the rest of us.

80
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,929
Stephen Arden.
Harvard Anthropology Department.

81
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,889
Expert at cross-cultural behavior.

82
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:58,975
Laura Baker. Hi. Molecular biologist.

83
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,230
And who are you,
and what do you do?

84
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,565
Preston Lennox.

85
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:07,984
And if I'm here...

86
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,487
...the shit has hit the fan.

87
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:13,907
What exactly is your area
of specialty, Mr. Lennox?

88
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,828
I'm a freelance solution to
our government's problems.

89
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,164
What exactly might they be?

90
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,919
The kind people don't usually
like to talk about.

91
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,756
You hunt people, don't you?

92
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:36,972
I guess so.

93
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,443
You in here? It's a little late for TV.

94
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,449
You in here, honey?

95
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,253
Good evening, I'm Xavier Fitch.

96
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:52,339
I'm in charge of this operation.

97
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:54,674
Would you sit a little closer, please?

98
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:07,103
In November of 1974...

99
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,065
...a small group from S.E.T.I...

100
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,360
...S-E-T-I, Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence...

101
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:15,904
...used radio dishes at Arecibo...

102
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,156
...to send a message to whoever
was listening.

103
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:21,076
They sent a quarter of a kilobyte...

104
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,912
...including structure
of human DNA...

105
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,206
...a map of our solar system...

106
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:29,543
...population of the Earth.
Helpful facts like that.

107
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:36,383
In January of 1993, Arecibo
received a message back...

108
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,844
...from an extra terrestrial...

109
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,637
...unknown source.

110
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,055
That's great.

111
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,724
Intelligent life beyond this planet?

112
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,142
Yes.

113
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,895
There were two communications.

114
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:53,650
The first message turned out to be
a superior catalyst for methane.

115
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,151
We now have the potential...

116
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,572
...to produce infinite energy
from this clean-burning fuel.

117
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:02,742
This convinced us we were dealing
with a friendly intelligence.

118
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:07,414
The second message turned out
to be a new sequence of DNA...

119
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:10,876
...with friendly instructions
on how to combine it with ours.

120
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:15,088
Here's some technical data.
Get feedback from Dr. Baker.

121
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:16,423
Basically...

122
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:20,093
...the new combined
DNA sequence...

123
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:22,554
...was injected into 100...

124
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:25,056
...human ova.

125
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,394
We got 7...

126
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:30,770
...to divide.

127
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,564
Four petered out.

128
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,108
Two were stored in liquid nitrogen.

129
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,777
And we allowed one to grow.

130
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:40,780
Its code name is "Sil."

131
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,783
That's after 2 hours.

132
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:46,494
One day.

133
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,289
Two days.

134
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,958
- My God.
- This growth is amazing.

135
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,627
A week.

136
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,047
- It's a girl.
Yes, I--

137
00:20:58,466 --> 00:20:59,841
We decided to make it female...

138
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,218
...so it would be more docile
and controllable.

139
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,679
More docile and controllable, huh?

140
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,058
Well, I guess you guys
don't get out much.

141
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:12,854
That's her 1 month
after she was born.

142
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:16,024
So you kept her caged in there?

143
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,652
It was safer to keep her isolated.

144
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,987
She didn't like being locked up.

145
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:22,989
She didn't like being alone.

146
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:24,741
Didn't she?

147
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:31,915
She's hiding something.
Something inside.

148
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,000
You're right, Dan.

149
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:38,421
This is three months after
she was born. Watch carefully.

150
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:42,258
What the hell was that?

151
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:43,927
Back the tape up.

152
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,765
Watch her eyes.

153
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,850
Rapid eye movement.
She's dreaming.

154
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:58,358
-She's having horrible nightmares.
-It's some kind of anxiety reaction.

155
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,151
Got me a little anxious.

156
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,363
It made the research team
a little anxious too...

157
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,950
...so the decision was made
to terminate the experiment...

158
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:10,078
...to run more research to see
what we were dealing with.

159
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,208
You were going to gas her?

160
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,419
That was the decision.

161
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:20,755
It makes you feel mad.

162
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,843
You feel mad that you had to
kill her, don't you?

163
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,386
I don't know.

164
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,560
Wow.

165
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,061
Yes.

166
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:45,405
Yesterday the body of a transient was
found in a boxcar near Salt Lake City.

167
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:48,366
Preliminary DNA tests conclude...

168
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,786
...he was killed by our creation,
by our Sil.

169
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:53,496
Found any other bodies?

170
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,206
- Not yet.
- You will.

171
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,083
She's a predator.

172
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:59,002
Her eyes are in front.

173
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:03,173
Her eyes are in front so she can
judge the distance to her prey.

174
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,507
That's right.

175
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,092
Where'd you learn that?

176
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:09,512
I saw it on the Discovery Channel.

177
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,016
I caught that show myself.

178
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,186
- Mr. Lennox.
- Yeah?

179
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,812
As the...

180
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:21,983
...non-scientist amongst us,
are you clear about what's going on?

181
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,152
I think so.

182
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,781
You created a monster...

183
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,992
...with a formula you got
from outer space.

184
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,288
The damn thing got away. Now you
want us to hunt it down and kill it.

185
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,291
Now, is that pretty close?

186
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:40,210
I guess.

187
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,669
You don't want us...

188
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:44,964
...to capture her alive
so that we can study her?

189
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:50,720
Laura, I think this is strictly a
search and destroy operation.

190
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:55,433
Nobody ever asked me to find
anything they didn't want dead.

191
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,977
I'm sorry for you.

192
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:00,980
Yeah, well....

193
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,649
Thank you, Dan.

194
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,151
I'm sorry for her.

195
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,989
<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>

196
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:14,410
<i>Welcome to Los Angeles. This is</i>
<i>the terminal stop for the Desert Star.</i>

197
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,163
<i>All passengers please disembark.</i>

198
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:23,378
Trains of Chicago,
<i>Salt Lake City, Las Vegas and Barstow...</i>

199
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,422
<i>...have arrived on track number five.</i>

200
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,911
Something bad happened here.

201
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,079
-No shit.
-Crushed her larynx.

202
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,956
She was afraid.

203
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,584
She's scared, frightened.

204
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:47,670
Hungry too.
She's been eating like a horse.

205
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,506
Our girl is definitely not on a diet.

206
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,968
She's storing calories for something.

207
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:55,595
Any ideas?

208
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:58,223
Oh, my....

209
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:01,935
Well, that's....

210
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,437
That looks like some sort of...

211
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:07,482
...chrysalis. Some kind of cocoon.

212
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,109
What are we looking for,
a giant moth?

213
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,530
If that is a cocoon...

214
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,242
-...she'll be fully-grown now.
-Fully-grown.

215
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,911
Maybe that's how
she got by our people.

216
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,746
They were looking for a child.

217
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,623
She is a child.

218
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,669
It stinks in here. I'm going outside.

219
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:38,596
Get the conductors' ID and
credit card numbers on your computer.

220
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,848
There's no sign of them on the train.

221
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,977
-Let's assume she took them.
-I'll see to that.

222
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:45,853
She kills if she's threatened.

223
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:49,482
And she has no remorse about it.
None.

224
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:52,026
Of course, Los Angeles
is perfect for her.

225
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,820
It's a city of the future.

226
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:55,238
Anything goes.

227
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:58,199
Totally mobile population.
Everyone's a stranger.

228
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:00,451
Very little is taboo or unacceptable.

229
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,662
Whatever she does,
no one will notice her.

230
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,039
Well, whatever. So....

231
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:09,002
Los Angeles is where the battle
will be fought...

232
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:11,713
...and won.

233
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:39,240
You look very pretty.

234
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:42,535
Do you have a hundred?

235
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,289
Here we are.

236
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:52,211
Be more careful with your money.
Not everybody's as honest as me.

237
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:56,716
Are you foreign?

238
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:01,220
Do you speak English?

239
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:05,725
-Yes.
-Here. You keep this.

240
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:09,312
Here, let me take this.

241
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:11,856
Be careful here.

242
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:13,399
Yes.

243
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,157
Watch your step.

244
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:35,588
Our laboratory, Visitor Base One...

245
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:40,259
...is being moved to some empty virus
research labs at the university.

246
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,971
They're moving our equipment now.
It'll be operational by 8:00.

247
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:47,433
Check into your rooms. Everyone out
front in 15 minutes. We'll go over.

248
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:49,102
What will we do?

249
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,604
Process the evidence from the train.

250
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:55,316
Could we try growing this creature
with its own DNA?

251
00:28:55,484 --> 00:29:00,655
We do a version without ours this time
and investigate its vulnerabilities.

252
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:01,948
That'd be good.

253
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,659
- Then I could know how it feels.
- Makes sense.

254
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:07,620
This human life form could be a mask.
Without the camouflage--

255
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:10,790
You're right. At least we'd know
what we were dealing with.

256
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:12,018
A couple of bozos just ran out.
I got a customer.

257
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:15,521
-Yes, young lady. Can I help you?
-I want a room.

258
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:20,568
62, including tax. That'll just
about cover the Honeymoon Suite.

259
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:41,714
<i>Hi. Come here often?</i>

260
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:44,258
<i>What's your sign?</i>

261
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:56,437
<i>Tired of brunette?</i>

262
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:58,356
<i>Change.</i>

263
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,900
<i>Change the color of your hair.</i>

264
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,401
<i>Color-Tress.</i>

265
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,954
I've increased the magnification.

266
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:22,296
When I pierce the cell,
the foreign DNA will be introduced.

267
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,559
Shit!

268
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,978
The camera's gone down.

269
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:39,230
Excuse me.

270
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:41,607
Do you have a replacement camera?

271
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:45,444
We do, but it'll take time for
the technician to replace it.

272
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:49,323
No. This happens in my lab
all the time. It's simple to replace it.

273
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,242
You saying you can do it?

274
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,203
Sure I can. I just need somebody
to give me a hand.

275
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:57,623
I don't want technicians in there.
This is classified.

276
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:01,836
I'll do it.

277
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:04,964
-Man of action, I like that.
-That's me.

278
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,476
Can you get that one for me?

279
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,793
Give me the camera.

280
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:58,225
Something's-- Something's wrong.

281
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:05,983
Christ, It's started already.

282
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,654
- It's started. Get the top back on.
- What?

283
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,947
Laura, Press, get the top back on.

284
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,533
Here you go.

285
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:17,495
She must have penetrated the cell.

286
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:20,539
- Shit.
- What was that?

287
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:21,832
He dropped the bolt.

288
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,504
- Find the bolt. Get the top on.
- I'm looking, Fitch.

289
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,924
Can they hear me in there?

290
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:31,384
Laura, Press...

291
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,679
- ...get the top on, then I'll let you out.
- Where'd it go?

292
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:41,352
- It fell through the grate.
- Can you lift it up?

293
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:47,024
- It's not gonna move.
- This isn't going anywhere.

294
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:48,734
- No, can't get it!
- Press...

295
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,736
...you gotta get the bolt!

296
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:52,029
Can't get it.

297
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,782
- The floor's welded down.
- Oh, my God.

298
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:56,742
Press. Oh, my God.

299
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,078
-I've never seen anything like this.
-Holy shit.

300
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,663
I can't let them out.

301
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:03,290
- Press, look.
- Come on.

302
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,252
Fitch, let us out of here!

303
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:08,337
Open the goddamn door!

304
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:11,716
- Not until I know what's in there!
- Open it now!

305
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,426
-Let them out.
-I can't!

306
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,886
- Open up the fucking door!
- Let us out!

307
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:19,932
- Tell me it'll stop growing, Dan.
- It's not, let them out!

308
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,979
Open up the door!

309
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:26,647
Press, Press.

310
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,525
What the fuck is that?!

311
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:32,111
Laura, get to the other door!

312
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,363
-Let her out, Fitch!
-I can't!

313
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,407
-Let her out!
-I can't!

314
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,284
- You motherfucker!
- Let her out!

315
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:40,953
- You've gotta let them out!
- I can't hold it in!

316
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:42,455
Get out of the way!

317
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,623
I'm gonna burn it!
Out of the way!

318
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:51,255
- What is this thing?
- In 2 minutes, I'm burning the room!

319
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,799
-What?
-I have to do it!

320
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,468
You have two minutes to kill it.

321
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:58,888
Disconnect the gas line.
Use it as a flamethrower.

322
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,563
- Aah!
- Laura, watch out!

323
00:35:10,484 --> 00:35:12,151
- Where'd it go?
- In the pipes!

324
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:13,819
- Open the door!
- Shut up, Dan!

325
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:19,325
<i>One minute remaining.</i>

326
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:32,922
Laura...

327
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,674
...it stopped moving. I think I killed it.

328
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:38,719
It's dead! Open the door!

329
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:40,679
It's dead, Fitch. Let them out.

330
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,401
Oh!

331
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:56,987
- Shit.
- What'll we do?

332
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:58,948
<i>30 seconds remaining.</i>

333
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,534
- There's not much time. Let's go.
- Open the door!

334
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,452
-Let them out.
-I can't do that.

335
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,579
-I have to follow protocol!
-What protocol?!

336
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,581
The protocols by which
we're doing this!

337
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,459
You didn't tell them that
before they went in.

338
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:13,128
- Fitch, let them out.
- Twelve, 11, 10....

339
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,881
-Fitch, let them out!
-I must follow protocol.

340
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:17,341
Let them out, Fitch!

341
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:19,885
Go. Get out of there!

342
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:23,055
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

343
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:25,015
- I had no choice.
- Yeah, sure.

344
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,602
The protocol is to burn the room
if anything went wrong!

345
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,417
Where's a good place
to find a man?

346
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:55,671
There's plenty of guys at the Id
around the corner. It's a club.

347
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:58,215
You won't have trouble
meeting somebody there.

348
00:36:58,383 --> 00:36:59,425
Thank you.

349
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,136
You can't miss it.
Look for the long line.

350
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,430
I need your credit card...

351
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:08,309
...for room incidentals,
long distance calls and so forth.

352
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:10,269
Credit card? Zip zap?

353
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,938
American Express, Visa,
MasterCard?

354
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,858
There you go. Thanks. All right.

355
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:17,192
Thank you.

356
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:19,445
Hey, wait a minute! Hey! Hey!

357
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,702
You don't want this falling
into the wrong hands.

358
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:28,370
No.

359
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,499
<i>Here's Justin Crawl. It's through.</i>

360
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:35,961
<i>And it's covered by the goalie.</i>
<i>18:42 let to go.</i>

361
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:37,171
Yeah?

362
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,173
The conductor's credit card
turned up...

363
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:42,009
...in a Hollywood motel.
The van's out front.

364
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,469
<i>Let's go.</i>

365
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,307
You two.

366
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:54,980
Enjoy yourselves.

367
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:58,651
You, legs. You're in. Go on.

368
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,675
Where are you from?

369
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,220
-I'm foreign.
-You're what?

370
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,514
-I'm foreign.
-Really?

371
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:30,516
Easy, easy.

372
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:33,560
I've got a party to go to
and no one to take me.

373
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,145
I'll take you.

374
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,772
- You will?
- Yeah.

375
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,024
Okay. I'm going
to the little girls' room.

376
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,944
Wait right here.

377
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:43,862
I'll be right back.

378
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,531
I'll be right here.

379
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,427
Whatever it takes, right?

380
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,847
All's fair in love and war.

381
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,022
Buddy....

382
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,582
Can't see much on that.

383
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,460
Get this tape to the lab. Enhance it.

384
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,628
See if we can get a better look.

385
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,630
She looks nice.

386
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,258
Do you have any idea
where she went?

387
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:50,012
- I'll find her.
- She wanted to meet a man.

388
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,973
I suggested a club called
the Id around the corner.

389
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,310
Get the tape.

390
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,499
I've got a party to go to
and no one to take me.

391
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,793
Where is this party?

392
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:22,669
I don't know.

393
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:34,640
Whoa, you can't park there!

394
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,600
Back that out!

395
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:40,479
-No, you can't go in there.
-What's going on?!

396
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:59,164
- There's been a murder!
- No one leaves here! I mean, nobody!

397
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:05,337
There's always some action
in this part of town.

398
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,518
<i>Blue-eyed blonde.</i>

399
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:23,689
Black leggings, pink sweater, 5' 10"
tall. Who'd she leave with?

400
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,525
Blonde leaves with a guy
is hardly news around here.

401
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,694
Name the top attractions. No losers.

402
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,238
Assume he's socially adept.
He'll be helping her out.

403
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:33,490
A friendly guy, not an asshole.

404
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,367
I'm thinking.

405
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,328
- Robbie left with a blonde.
- That's him.

406
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:40,664
That's him.

407
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,542
Come on. Let me show you
the rest of the house.

408
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,545
I'm still sweaty from that place.

409
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,213
It's so crowded.

410
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:54,761
Like it?

411
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:57,222
Yes.

412
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,932
I feel like a shower.

413
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:01,101
You want one?

414
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,395
Tell you what.

415
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:05,063
I'm taking one.

416
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:06,982
You wanna take one later...

417
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,650
...no problem.

418
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:54,279
Take off your clothes.

419
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,616
I want to see you.

420
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,625
Very nice.

421
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:18,553
Take me back.

422
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,681
What are you talking about?

423
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:22,683
You know why we came here.

424
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,643
I've changed my mind.

425
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:27,271
All right. You said "no."

426
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:30,065
It's duly noted. Come here.

427
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:31,358
I wanna go!

428
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:34,611
Too late. You're not leaving!
You're not!

429
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:40,284
-All right.
-That's better.

430
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:12,793
What's happening? Kills a girl
at the club, kills this guy.

431
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:16,046
I'd say she fits the definition
of a psychopath.

432
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,090
Nothing inhibits her.

433
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:21,009
No moral sense, no social structure.

434
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:25,389
She wasn't exactly smothered with a
mother's love or taught good manners.

435
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:27,349
I asked what was happening.

436
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,726
He did something, she was angry.

437
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:32,896
She'll kill if she's threatened
or if anyone gets in her way.

438
00:45:33,106 --> 00:45:34,314
Of what?

439
00:45:34,524 --> 00:45:35,774
Her life cycle.

440
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:38,110
I think she's trying to mate.

441
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:39,486
Reproduce.

442
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,113
Okay.

443
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,073
So why did she kill the girl?

444
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,075
Sexual competition.

445
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,827
She's hard on the competition.

446
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,453
Now she managed to mate.

447
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:52,749
Doesn't look like a success.
He's still got his pants on.

448
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:55,252
- She's frustrated.
- Who isn't?

449
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,088
What's her problem?
She was here with him.

450
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,923
Maybe she rejected him.

451
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:02,050
She probably has special senses.

452
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:06,513
Rats can sense diseased or genetic
damage in their potential mates...

453
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,181
...so we can test his body...

454
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:12,978
...for hereditary diseases or defects
that would make him a loser...

455
00:46:13,146 --> 00:46:14,479
...essentially.

456
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:15,981
Needles.

457
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:19,734
Maybe he was a doper,
or a diabetic.

458
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:22,821
Either way would make
him unacceptable. Excuse me.

459
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,158
All right.

460
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:30,662
Insulin. Diabetic.
There you have it.

461
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:33,540
She could have just walked out.
Why kill him?

462
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,876
He pissed her off.

463
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:38,545
Some men, when rejected,
get insistent.

464
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:41,381
- Put an APB out on his car.
- We have.

465
00:46:41,591 --> 00:46:44,593
We'll go back to the motel.
I want to check it out.

466
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:47,846
More docile and controllable,
huh, Fitch?

467
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:04,946
- What do you think, Dan?
- What do I think?

468
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,657
I think she'd want to be alone now.

469
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:12,537
I don't think she's gonna come
here with all these cars outside.

470
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:15,707
You're assuming she could
find her way back here.

471
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:17,125
She could.

472
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:18,960
What is it?

473
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:22,506
Maybe menstrual blood.

474
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:26,051
If she's menstruating,
she can reproduce.

475
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:27,511
Yes, I know.

476
00:49:04,317 --> 00:49:05,650
Shit.

477
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:12,657
Oh, Jesus.

478
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:14,117
Excuse me.

479
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:17,829
Call a paramedic!
Anybody got a phone?

480
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:26,254
If your commute
<i>takes you westbound on the 10 freeway...</i>

481
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:28,006
<i>...expect an hour delay.</i>

482
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,634
<i>The drive will be slow to Malibu.</i>

483
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:40,101
The video enhancement
is not that great.

484
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:42,479
How old do you
think she is? Twenty, 23?

485
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,816
Her reproductive system
should be fully developed.

486
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:49,027
Her biological clock must be
in hyperdrive.

487
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,362
She wants a baby.

488
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:53,281
If she has a child
our problems have just begun.

489
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:56,576
If her offspring is male and develops
at the same rate as Sil...

490
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:00,413
...it could reproduce in 6 months.

491
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:04,250
God knows how many females
it could impregnate.

492
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:05,919
Fitch.

493
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:10,548
When a predatory species
is introduced...

494
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:12,384
...into a closed ecological system...

495
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:15,637
...the extinction of the weaker species
is inevitable.

496
00:50:15,805 --> 00:50:18,556
They found the murdered guy's BMW,
out of gas in Santa Monica.

497
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:20,016
What's her name?

498
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:22,394
-I don't know.
-Who are you?

499
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:26,690
She didn't have any ID.
I thought I'd make sure she was okay.

500
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:28,692
You think she's got insurance?

501
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:32,445
I don't know. Just put it on
my credit card for now.

502
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:36,616
And you don't know her name.
Guys like you are hard to find.

503
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:46,459
Get a lab workup on that, stat.

504
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:52,048
Get her up to x-ray.
I want an x-ray on this.

505
00:50:52,258 --> 00:50:54,634
It looks like a scapula fracture.

506
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:05,770
Your shoulder wound.

507
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:10,942
What's going on here?

508
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,532
Doctor, we need you now.

509
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,033
A child burn victim just came in.

510
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:20,952
- What is going on here?
- Doctor, please.

511
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,747
Jesus Christ!
Did you see her shoulder?

512
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,999
Please. We need you immediately.

513
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:36,176
You're okay.

514
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:37,594
I'm okay.

515
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:40,346
I was sure you were
seriously injured.

516
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:42,015
I'm okay.

517
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:44,309
You are. It's a miracle.

518
00:51:45,186 --> 00:51:46,311
Can we go?

519
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,272
Did the doctor say you could go?

520
00:51:49,482 --> 00:51:50,690
Yes.

521
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,611
We'll send somebody over there.
Thanks a lot.

522
00:51:57,323 --> 00:52:01,826
Doctor over at Parkbay Hospital
called in with some weird story.

523
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:04,162
We should check it out.
It's a few miles away.

524
00:52:04,497 --> 00:52:05,789
Laura...

525
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:08,333
...Press, take a car, check it out.

526
00:52:08,501 --> 00:52:11,127
-Parkbay Hospital?
-Yeah, Parkbay.

527
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:16,758
She walked.

528
00:52:18,511 --> 00:52:19,844
She walked that way...

529
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:22,680
...not too long ago.

530
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,816
Got some fruit and cheese.

531
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:36,277
What is that?

532
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:38,196
You mean the hot tub?

533
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,365
A hot tub.

534
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,242
I love this place.

535
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:45,328
It's away from the traffic
and business and people.

536
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:48,331
Sometimes it feels like
you're not in L.A. anymore.

537
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:50,041
Here.

538
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:52,168
We'll immortalize the moment.

539
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:03,596
Look at the camera.

540
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:11,855
This girl literally
reformed her bones.

541
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,356
It's her.

542
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:14,858
Who checked her in?

543
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:16,985
I don't know. Let's find out.

544
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:20,613
She had no insurance so this guy
put it on his own credit card.

545
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:24,868
Here's the file. John F. Carey.

546
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:29,747
You don't have a driver's license
or home address?

547
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:33,459
No, sir.
Just an imprint of his credit card.

548
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:36,504
Give us a printout
of what you've got.

549
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:38,047
No problem.

550
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,510
Some candy?

551
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:55,773
It's in the Palisades and
he's got a phone number.

552
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:59,485
Tell Fitch where we're headed,
and try to get John Carey on the line.

553
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,351
I'd better get the phone.

554
00:54:38,651 --> 00:54:41,027
I've got his machine.
Should I leave a message?

555
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:42,528
Yeah.

556
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:45,698
Tell him he's about to copulate
with a creature from outer space.

557
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:49,035
-Copulate, huh?
-Yeah.

558
00:54:50,663 --> 00:54:51,913
I like you.

559
00:54:52,164 --> 00:54:53,414
I know.

560
00:54:58,337 --> 00:55:00,588
It's not too soon for us
to be together.

561
00:55:02,091 --> 00:55:03,925
No, it's not too soon.

562
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:07,428
You don't need these.

563
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,889
Hey, hey. That's a little fast.

564
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:13,309
Whoa! Whoo! Whoo!
Oh! Whoa!

565
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:20,733
Whoa!

566
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,612
What's the matter?

567
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:26,531
Take it easy.

568
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:30,868
Just relax.

569
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:33,871
There's plenty of time.

570
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:43,881
What is it?

571
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:48,594
I think someone's at the door.

572
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,013
Don't go.

573
00:55:50,723 --> 00:55:52,849
Please. I want a baby.

574
00:55:53,142 --> 00:55:55,393
What?! Excuse me?

575
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:07,405
Let's go around the side.

576
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:51,949
<i>Outside.</i>

577
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:52,570
-What happened?
-A squirrel! A fucking squirrel!

578
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:55,239
- She was here.
- Yeah, she was.

579
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:57,617
I wanna make sure
she's not still here.

580
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:28,022
Perhaps we should check the body
for evidence that they've had sex.

581
00:59:35,447 --> 00:59:37,782
I used to be scared
at the sight of blood.

582
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:40,451
Now I guess I'm getting used to it.

583
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:43,204
Oh, yes.

584
01:00:08,689 --> 01:00:09,981
-Hey!
-Help me, please!

585
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,774
Oh, my God. What's the matter?

586
01:00:12,776 --> 01:00:14,610
We found this in the living room.

587
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:17,780
She liked him.

588
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:21,325
Well, not enough.

589
01:00:21,994 --> 01:00:25,121
Can't see any more on that than
we did on the video monitor.

590
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,581
He didn't get a good picture of her.

591
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:30,835
There's no evidence of semen
in the hot tub water.

592
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:32,837
Maybe she took it with.

593
01:00:33,005 --> 01:00:35,172
So she probably
hasn't managed to mate.

594
01:00:35,424 --> 01:00:38,467
-We interrupted her.
-Yes, I think we did.

595
01:00:38,677 --> 01:00:40,678
Give me something I can use.

596
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:44,015
What have you
come up with lately, Fitch?

597
01:00:49,688 --> 01:00:51,188
She's not scared of us.

598
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:52,857
That's for sure.

599
01:00:56,737 --> 01:00:58,237
We're all beat.

600
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:00,448
We'll go back to the hotel and rest.

601
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:02,908
Tomorrow night...

602
01:01:03,285 --> 01:01:05,036
...we'll go back to the club.

603
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:07,872
- Stake it out.
- Stake it out.

604
01:01:10,959 --> 01:01:12,209
She's not stupid.

605
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:13,919
She won't repeat herself.

606
01:01:14,129 --> 01:01:17,381
There's no point going there.
It provided a poor specimen.

607
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:18,632
I'm not sure.

608
01:01:18,842 --> 01:01:21,552
She's been in the city two days.
It's what she knows.

609
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,429
I'd rather try the club...

610
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:28,059
...than sit at the command center
reminiscing about how close we got.

611
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:44,241
She would make one excellent
biological weapon.

612
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:48,412
If someone thought we were some
kind of galactic weed that would...

613
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:50,623
...spread through the universe.

614
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:53,959
So what you're saying is that...

615
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:56,587
...she's the cure and
we're the disease.

616
01:01:57,089 --> 01:01:58,339
That's well said.

617
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,217
"Baker, Laura.

618
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:05,137
1735 Meander Drive,
Simi Valley, California."

619
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:06,764
That's you, right?

620
01:02:07,516 --> 01:02:09,266
Last time I checked.

621
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:11,644
What do you do for kicks out there?

622
01:02:12,604 --> 01:02:13,687
Oh....

623
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:15,898
Pine for guys like you.

624
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:17,358
That's what I thought.

625
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,548
So anyone hungry?

626
01:02:40,841 --> 01:02:44,969
Uh, no, thanks. I'm beat.
I'm gonna try to get some sleep.

627
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:47,388
-Good night.
-Yeah. Night.

628
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:51,851
-I'll have something to eat with you.
-Thanks, Dan.

629
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:56,957
- Do you ever have nightmares?
- Yes.

630
01:03:57,751 --> 01:03:59,877
Please untie my hands.

631
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:03,088
-I wouldn't hurt you. Please.
-I have them.

632
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:08,135
I think they tell me who I am.

633
01:04:08,887 --> 01:04:10,721
Why are you doing this to me?

634
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:15,226
I don't know why I'm here.

635
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:17,895
I don't know who I am, who sent me.

636
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:21,732
-Do you?
-No!

637
01:04:25,237 --> 01:04:28,239
-Why do you think you're here?
-I don't know.

638
01:04:29,241 --> 01:04:30,866
Please let me go.

639
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:33,452
Please. Please, let me go.

640
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:37,748
I wouldn't hurt you.

641
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:39,667
I promise.

642
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:42,002
-I wouldn't hurt you.
-Yes, you would.

643
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:44,338
You just don't know it yet.

644
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,591
No, I wouldn't!

645
01:04:47,759 --> 01:04:49,176
Please!

646
01:04:50,762 --> 01:04:53,180
My hands are hurting me.

647
01:04:57,435 --> 01:05:00,938
Thank you.

648
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:09,154
Oh, my God!

649
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:26,880
Oh, my God, no!

650
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:30,593
No! No!

651
01:07:29,671 --> 01:07:31,672
Laura and Press,
they like each other.

652
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:33,966
They just don't like to show
how they feel.

653
01:07:34,134 --> 01:07:35,509
What?

654
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:38,929
Laura and Press,
they like each other.

655
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:41,056
Yeah, whatever you say, Dan.

656
01:07:41,266 --> 01:07:44,435
Look, it's really smoky in here.
I'm gonna go outside, get some air.

657
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:48,981
Think I'll lie down in the van. Have a
rest. This is a complete waste of time.

658
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:53,694
Get a feeling you're on
a wild goose chase?

659
01:07:53,862 --> 01:07:55,279
Yeah.

660
01:07:56,448 --> 01:07:57,656
Excuse me.

661
01:08:58,343 --> 01:09:01,178
Get out of here. This is my trashcan.

662
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:13,690
It's you.

663
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:22,032
Hey!

664
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:24,993
She's here! Hey!

665
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:33,210
- Dan. Is that her?
- Yeah.

666
01:09:33,378 --> 01:09:34,586
Here.

667
01:09:41,052 --> 01:09:42,636
Get in the van.

668
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:46,515
Everybody get in the van!

669
01:09:55,066 --> 01:09:58,068
They're heading into the hills.
We'll need the helicopters.

670
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:14,126
We're going up Nichols Canyon. One
of you try to block her at Mulholland.

671
01:10:30,852 --> 01:10:32,603
Whoa! Watch it!

672
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:35,874
Oh, my God!

673
01:12:10,994 --> 01:12:14,746
We blocked the road.
We've gotta tell the press something.

674
01:12:14,956 --> 01:12:17,833
Tell them what you want,
just don't tell them the truth.

675
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:21,294
I don't buy her showing up at
the club. It's too damn convenient.

676
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:24,339
Seeing is believing or
don't you trust your eyes?

677
01:12:24,549 --> 01:12:26,717
Get back! Get all these people back!

678
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:29,970
Fitch. Fitch. It doesn't feel right.

679
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:31,555
Sir!

680
01:12:31,723 --> 01:12:35,434
We found a severed thumb in
one of the doors that got ripped off.

681
01:12:35,643 --> 01:12:38,854
- Let me see that.
- She may have caught it in the door.

682
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:41,064
Get to the lab, see if it's hers.

683
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:44,526
- It'll be genetically identifiable.
- It's all over, everyone.

684
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:47,029
Tomorrow you can go back
to your lives.

685
01:12:47,238 --> 01:12:49,573
Congratulations on a job well done.

686
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:55,078
Just like that, huh, Fitch?

687
01:12:55,747 --> 01:12:57,247
I don't think so.

688
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:09,843
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

689
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:11,595
<i>And Frank, I'm going to dinner.</i>

690
01:13:11,763 --> 01:13:14,431
<i>Where are we meeting?</i>
<i>Bye, sweetie.</i>

691
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:18,310
Waiter.

692
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:21,271
Well, I guess we won.

693
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:26,651
-We won, science lost.
-I didn't think we'd get her this way.

694
01:13:27,612 --> 01:13:29,738
-Not that easy.
-You sound like you'll miss her.

695
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:31,073
I guess I will.

696
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:33,658
I think I respected her.

697
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:40,457
I know this was a hellish job, but I
really enjoyed working with you three.

698
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:43,585
And since Uncle Sam is buying,
let's have another round.

699
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:44,795
Waiter!

700
01:13:45,088 --> 01:13:46,963
I don't-- I don't drink.

701
01:13:47,298 --> 01:13:48,924
Don't worry, Dan. Tonight you will.

702
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:52,469
You wanna dance?

703
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:54,763
-Who, me?
-Yeah, you.

704
01:13:57,934 --> 01:14:00,102
-All right.
-Okay.

705
01:14:16,119 --> 01:14:20,789
I know you don't have a family.
Do you have a girlfriend in New York?

706
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:25,293
I guess I've had a few, but
they don't hang around very long.

707
01:14:26,129 --> 01:14:28,296
I guess I keep too many secrets.

708
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:30,340
You wanna share one with me?

709
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,676
-Right now?
-Yeah.

710
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:41,601
I know what you do,
and it doesn't scare me.

711
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:44,020
- Really?
- No.

712
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,231
Well, it does most people.

713
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:53,321
I wouldn't wanna
never see you again.

714
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:01,872
- Hey.
- What are you--?

715
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:05,959
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I thought you were somebody else.

716
01:15:06,127 --> 01:15:07,544
I'm sorry.

717
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:10,714
You okay?

718
01:15:10,882 --> 01:15:13,508
I thought it was Sil.
I saw the blonde hair.

719
01:15:13,718 --> 01:15:15,218
She's dead, Press.

720
01:15:15,386 --> 01:15:17,929
The tests on the thumb
proved it was her.

721
01:15:18,139 --> 01:15:21,349
You got your test and I got my gut.
I just don't buy it.

722
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:26,062
I think as long as you feel
she's out there, you got a mission.

723
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:27,898
Maybe you don't want
this job to be over.

724
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:31,651
Uh-huh. Well, maybe not.
So what?

725
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:36,740
Thanks for the dance.

726
01:15:51,214 --> 01:15:52,422
Good night.

727
01:15:59,472 --> 01:16:00,722
What do you call this?

728
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:03,266
It's called a Long Island Ice Tea.

729
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,894
It's got tea in it?

730
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:08,104
Nope.

731
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:27,582
Smells nice, can I try some?

732
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:29,918
Help yourself.

733
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:36,925
Does it work on your boyfriend?

734
01:16:37,134 --> 01:16:39,094
Yeah. As a repellent.

735
01:16:42,974 --> 01:16:46,434
I don't know. I think he's in remarkably
good shape for a man his age.

736
01:16:58,114 --> 01:17:00,198
One Long Island Ice Tea.

737
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:04,703
I like these cups of tea.

738
01:17:06,998 --> 01:17:08,999
-What?
-That's great.

739
01:17:09,292 --> 01:17:11,793
What? What?

740
01:17:15,006 --> 01:17:16,881
Hey, give me one of those.

741
01:17:17,717 --> 01:17:20,343
I like these cups of tea, man.

742
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:23,513
You guys, I'm tired.
I'm gonna go to bed.

743
01:17:26,851 --> 01:17:28,059
So?

744
01:17:29,729 --> 01:17:31,021
She's going to bed.

745
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:32,564
I guess.

746
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:36,234
She still...

747
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:38,987
...wants to see you though.

748
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:45,201
Maybe I'll go find out
if you're right about that.

749
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:13,480
I'd hate to be in here
during an earthquake.

750
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:14,981
Yeah.

751
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:16,983
What floor do you want?

752
01:18:17,401 --> 01:18:19,069
Ten, please.

753
01:18:28,913 --> 01:18:30,997
I like your perfume.

754
01:18:31,582 --> 01:18:32,791
You do?

755
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:36,669
-Thank you.
-Excuse me. I get out here.

756
01:18:40,841 --> 01:18:42,092
Good night.

757
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:08,910
Yes!

758
01:19:19,046 --> 01:19:21,089
- Hi.
- Hi.

759
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:40,316
Did you want something?

760
01:19:41,235 --> 01:19:43,736
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

761
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:30,950
Housekeeping.

762
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:35,330
Dan. Dan.

763
01:20:35,498 --> 01:20:38,666
Those two over there.
Bet they like unusual men like us.

764
01:20:40,002 --> 01:20:41,878
Women think I'm strange.

765
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:43,755
I don't feel well.

766
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:45,840
Don't be silly.

767
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:48,426
Just go over there and talk to them.

768
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:51,846
I have to go. And I think
you should leave with me, okay?

769
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:56,809
I'm gonna stay for a while, actually.

770
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:00,605
Okay.

771
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:03,107
I'll see you tomorrow.

772
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:07,320
Housekeeping.

773
01:21:22,503 --> 01:21:23,795
-Hi.
-Hi.

774
01:21:23,963 --> 01:21:26,381
I was sitting over there, wondering...

775
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:30,134
...what two intelligent, glamorous
women were doing without dates.

776
01:21:30,344 --> 01:21:31,886
My name's Stephen Arden.

777
01:21:32,096 --> 01:21:34,222
I teach anthropology at Harvard.

778
01:21:34,431 --> 01:21:36,057
-I lived in Boston once.
-Yeah?

779
01:21:36,267 --> 01:21:37,475
- Hi.
- For a year.

780
01:21:37,643 --> 01:21:40,562
-Froze my butt off.
-It's cold in Boston.

781
01:21:40,771 --> 01:21:43,189
This is Bill and Tony.
I forget your name.

782
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:50,405
Cute little socks.

783
01:21:52,116 --> 01:21:53,575
Stand up.

784
01:22:33,532 --> 01:22:35,116
How'd you get in here?

785
01:22:35,451 --> 01:22:37,660
-I stole the key.
-What?

786
01:22:38,162 --> 01:22:40,955
I saw you downstairs, but
you were with all those people.

787
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:43,499
So I thought I'd come up and wait.

788
01:22:44,001 --> 01:22:45,251
Whoa.

789
01:22:47,129 --> 01:22:49,464
This kind of thing doesn't
usually happen to me.

790
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,467
I just want to be with you.

791
01:22:52,635 --> 01:22:54,552
Hmm? You--?

792
01:23:03,437 --> 01:23:05,021
Oh, yes.

793
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:20,745
What about protection?

794
01:24:16,135 --> 01:24:18,136
She's here. She's here.

795
01:24:47,166 --> 01:24:48,624
- Press?
- Hmm?

796
01:24:48,959 --> 01:24:50,668
Someone's at the door.

797
01:24:52,588 --> 01:24:53,629
Who's there?

798
01:24:53,839 --> 01:24:55,089
Press, Laura.

799
01:24:55,257 --> 01:24:57,300
It's Dan. I gotta talk to you.

800
01:24:57,676 --> 01:25:00,136
Christ, what does he want?

801
01:25:10,063 --> 01:25:12,940
-What's the problem, Dan?
-I just got this terrible feeling.

802
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:16,277
I get this strange thought,
this image of Sil with Arden.

803
01:25:16,487 --> 01:25:17,904
Sil's next door with Arden, Press.

804
01:25:18,322 --> 01:25:20,615
No, no, no. She's dead, Dan.

805
01:25:20,991 --> 01:25:24,660
I went to his room and there's
someone in there with him.

806
01:25:24,828 --> 01:25:28,372
-Did you knock on the door?
-Yes, but I don't know what she'll do.

807
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:32,418
They're making a lot of noise.
They're having sex.

808
01:25:32,628 --> 01:25:34,796
I know it's Sil, I know it!

809
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:36,422
Okay.

810
01:25:36,799 --> 01:25:38,841
I believe you. I'll get dressed.

811
01:25:49,228 --> 01:25:50,812
Oh, my God.

812
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,734
I enjoyed that immensely.

813
01:26:05,911 --> 01:26:07,078
Oh.

814
01:26:15,254 --> 01:26:17,880
-I felt it.
-What?

815
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:22,718
It's started.

816
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:25,346
What's started?

817
01:26:25,514 --> 01:26:26,556
Life.

818
01:26:27,975 --> 01:26:29,892
Oh, my darling girl.

819
01:26:30,435 --> 01:26:34,605
In some cultures, women believe
they know the moment of conception--

820
01:26:34,815 --> 01:26:36,482
Don't you believe me? Feel.

821
01:26:41,989 --> 01:26:43,155
Holy shit!

822
01:26:49,496 --> 01:26:51,497
I hope you're right about this, Dan.

823
01:27:03,844 --> 01:27:06,262
- She's headed for the basement.
- We'll take the stairs.

824
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:07,847
Laura, come with me!

825
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:09,265
Come on!

826
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:16,397
If she's pregnant, we gotta
get to her before she gives birth.

827
01:27:16,565 --> 01:27:19,483
God. We don't know what
we're dealing with here.

828
01:27:19,651 --> 01:27:23,529
She could have a dozen babies.
She could lay 1000 eggs!

829
01:27:23,697 --> 01:27:27,033
Oh, God. Did you see Arden?

830
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:28,951
Yeah, I did, that poor bastard.

831
01:27:29,119 --> 01:27:33,748
We can trap her. The fire door opens
from the inside at the bottom exit.

832
01:27:33,957 --> 01:27:34,999
Then what?

833
01:27:37,461 --> 01:27:38,711
Holy shit.

834
01:27:38,879 --> 01:27:42,006
-Oh, my God.
-The bitch went through a steel door!

835
01:27:42,341 --> 01:27:45,134
Fitch! Dan! We're in the garage!
She got past us!

836
01:27:56,521 --> 01:27:59,065
-You saw her?
-She was gone before we got here.

837
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:00,608
- Here.
- You saw her!

838
01:28:00,776 --> 01:28:02,777
- Look at the door!
- Which way did she go?

839
01:28:02,945 --> 01:28:04,111
-I don't know.
-Where's Press?

840
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:05,738
He took off down that tunnel.

841
01:28:20,754 --> 01:28:23,756
She kills if she feels threatened.

842
01:28:23,924 --> 01:28:26,092
She kills if she feels threatened.

843
01:28:48,407 --> 01:28:50,366
She must've come through here.

844
01:29:12,848 --> 01:29:14,890
She went down
here. There's no other way.

845
01:29:15,058 --> 01:29:16,517
Yeah, she's down there.

846
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:19,020
Let's go.

847
01:29:19,521 --> 01:29:21,856
Stand back, I'll clear it out.

848
01:30:15,077 --> 01:30:17,244
Which way did she go, Dan?

849
01:30:18,497 --> 01:30:19,538
I don't know.

850
01:30:19,706 --> 01:30:22,625
- What?
- I'm not sure. She's here.

851
01:30:22,834 --> 01:30:27,755
Think. You're supposed to have some
extrasensory power! Which way?

852
01:30:28,548 --> 01:30:31,383
Which way did she go, Dan?
-I don't know!

853
01:30:31,551 --> 01:30:33,677
- I don't know!
- Which way did she go?

854
01:30:35,972 --> 01:30:37,431
-I think she went that way.
-Think?!

855
01:30:37,599 --> 01:30:38,808
That's good enough for me.

856
01:30:38,975 --> 01:30:40,810
You think she went that way?

857
01:30:42,104 --> 01:30:44,814
You don't fucking know, don't you?
You don't fucking know.

858
01:30:44,981 --> 01:30:47,399
I'll go this way. You come with me.

859
01:30:47,609 --> 01:30:49,735
- Come with me, Dan!
- Fitch.

860
01:30:51,488 --> 01:30:53,239
I think she went this way.

861
01:31:11,091 --> 01:31:17,346
Dan?

862
01:31:52,299 --> 01:31:53,966
Aah!

863
01:31:54,593 --> 01:31:55,843
Fitch. Fitch.

864
01:31:57,387 --> 01:31:58,804
Dan?

865
01:32:01,433 --> 01:32:02,808
What happened?

866
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:13,402
I can feel her.

867
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:17,740
She's that way.

868
01:32:21,745 --> 01:32:24,413
I never thought
I'd want to kill something.

869
01:32:24,789 --> 01:32:26,457
Never thought I'd want to.

870
01:32:58,156 --> 01:32:59,281
Hey.

871
01:33:01,868 --> 01:33:04,870
It's this way. It's back here.

872
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:38,237
Hey, she went in here.

873
01:33:43,493 --> 01:33:45,911
This must have opened up
during the earthquake.

874
01:33:47,247 --> 01:33:48,998
Okay, stand back.

875
01:35:01,196 --> 01:35:02,404
Wow.

876
01:35:05,033 --> 01:35:06,241
Is that oil?

877
01:35:06,534 --> 01:35:07,868
Looks like it.

878
01:35:15,543 --> 01:35:18,754
I'm going back there to see
if I can flush her out.

879
01:35:18,922 --> 01:35:21,757
If she comes back through here,
let her have it.

880
01:35:37,023 --> 01:35:38,941
Dan. Dan!

881
01:36:38,668 --> 01:36:41,837
- Dan, what is it?
- I don't know.

882
01:36:42,005 --> 01:36:43,338
I don't know.

883
01:37:44,067 --> 01:37:45,359
Dan.

884
01:38:06,839 --> 01:38:08,423
Okay.

885
01:38:10,343 --> 01:38:11,635
It's okay.

886
01:38:13,263 --> 01:38:14,555
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

887
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:16,640
You come here.

888
01:38:18,935 --> 01:38:20,936
Come on. I got you.

889
01:38:24,065 --> 01:38:25,816
Aah! Unh!

890
01:38:25,984 --> 01:38:28,318
Press, something's happened
to Dan!

891
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:30,779
You okay?

892
01:38:32,156 --> 01:38:35,033
Oh! Shit!

893
01:38:37,161 --> 01:38:38,662
Dan?

894
01:38:39,664 --> 01:38:41,331
Dan?

895
01:38:42,166 --> 01:38:43,500
I'm stuck!

896
01:38:45,712 --> 01:38:47,087
Press!

897
01:38:48,548 --> 01:38:51,133
I need your help! I'm stuck!

898
01:39:17,577 --> 01:39:18,827
Press!

899
01:39:20,163 --> 01:39:22,164
Dan, you gotta hang on!

900
01:39:29,464 --> 01:39:31,089
Press!

901
01:39:35,219 --> 01:39:36,470
Dan, keep on.

902
01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:53,195
Press!

903
01:40:43,079 --> 01:40:44,371
Hang on, Dan!

904
01:40:46,708 --> 01:40:47,916
Hang on!

905
01:40:49,127 --> 01:40:50,168
I got you.

906
01:40:52,046 --> 01:40:54,047
I got you, Dan. Hang on.

907
01:40:54,757 --> 01:40:56,133
Shit.

908
01:41:03,725 --> 01:41:05,225
Hang on!

909
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:08,437
Hang on, Dan!

910
01:41:12,734 --> 01:41:14,651
Get rid of her, Press!

911
01:41:19,157 --> 01:41:20,365
Duck your head.

912
01:41:21,951 --> 01:41:24,244
Let go, you motherfucker.

913
01:41:26,831 --> 01:41:29,499
-I got you. Hold on, I got you.
-Shit.

914
01:41:35,131 --> 01:41:36,757
I thought I was dead.

915
01:41:40,261 --> 01:41:43,472
I thought you'd drank your
last Long Island Ice Tea.

916
01:41:43,639 --> 01:41:45,015
Yeah, I thought we all had.

917
01:41:47,393 --> 01:41:49,603
Hey, you okay?

918
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:51,354
Yeah, I'm okay.

919
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:54,441
My pants are a little messed up.

920
01:41:55,026 --> 01:41:56,359
But I'm okay.

921
01:41:58,780 --> 01:42:01,281
She was half us,
half something else.

922
01:42:02,116 --> 01:42:04,284
I wonder which was
the predatory half.

923
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:07,204
The dead half.

924
01:42:07,538 --> 01:42:09,039
Let's get the hell out of here.

925
01:42:53,543 --> 01:42:56,920
I never thought I'd be
so happy to be back in a sewer.
