1
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,530
I'm Sorry. .

2
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,770
Sir, she's breaking out!

3
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:53,290
What are we looking for?

4
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,710
She's gone over the fence!

5
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,370
A couple of trains
came through here

6
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,210
around the time she escaped.

7
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,590
Could she get this far
in that time?

8
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:28,040
- Is she that fast?
- She is that fast.

9
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,040
- And this, too?
- 3.10.

10
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,580
- $3.10?
- Right.

11
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,430
- Here's your change.
- Thank you.

12
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,390
Can I help you?

13
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,060
The total's 17.95.

14
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,650
Here's your card.

15
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,200
Are you buying those?

16
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,300
Have a nice trip.

17
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:01,190
It's a brown tweed bag
with leather trim.

18
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,870
Porter was going
to put it on the cart.

19
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,800
This is the cart,
but there's no bag.

20
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,150
This was the largest earthquake

21
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,110
to strike an urban area
in nearly 50...

22
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:39,330
He's riding Green Lightnin'.

23
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:44,210
Enjoy the view.

24
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,270
Excuse me.

25
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,530
We shouldn't be seen together.

26
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:39,000
- Do you think Arlen suspects?
- No.

27
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,590
Tickets, please.

28
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:50,490
Are you travelling alone?
What, you're 12?

29
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:55,120
Someone going to meet you
in Los Angeles?

30
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,330
We'll say you're 11.
You only pay half-price.

31
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,430
Can't believe
our little girl did this.

32
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,850
She's not a little girl.

33
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,520
DNA typing proves it was her.

34
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,820
She could be in Chicago,
Las Vegas, LA, anywhere.

35
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,360
We should stop all the trains.

36
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:37,370
And have the police ask
questions we can't answer?

37
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,960
Put key personnel at every stop.

38
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:46,380
I want a team to hunt her down.

39
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,890
Good morning, Jill. Thank you
for taking care of my cat.

40
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,600
We will, won't we, Lorca?

41
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,980
I won't be gone very long.

42
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:59,900
- Take care of yourself.
- Bye-bye.

43
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,450
Do you still have problems
with people at work?

44
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:08,500
They say I'm the weird one,
I'm the strange one.

45
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,340
Why, because I have feelings?

46
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:15,250
Because I feel?

47
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,050
There's someone at the door.

48
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,740
They can come back
at the end of the hour.

49
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,520
That's for me.

50
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,820
Sorry to interrupt.
We need your help, an.

51
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:35,330
I know. Got to go.

52
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,010
Oh, God.

53
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:43,780
Mr Fitch will be
with you all in a moment.

54
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,890
We all must be here for the same
reason, whatever that is.

55
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:01,020
I'm Dan Smithson, and I don't
know why I'm here either.

56
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:06,070
But they said they needed me
and it was very important.

57
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,700
What do you do, Dan?

58
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:13,530
I...l'm an empath.

59
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:18,250
Sometimes they show me
awful things people have done

60
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:21,880
and I try. to tell them
why they did it.

61
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,010
What qualifies you for that?

62
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:29,310
I feel things deeply.

63
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:34,190
What am I feeling right now?

64
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,910
You want to believe
that nothing affects you,

65
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,790
that...you're not afraid
of anything.

66
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:50,720
But you're curious,
just like the rest of us.

67
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:54,390
Steven Arden, Harvard
Anthropology epartment,

68
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,810
expert in cross-cultural
behaviour.

69
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,570
Laura Baker.
Molecular biologist.

70
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,650
And who are you,
and what do you do?

71
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,990
Preston Lennox.

72
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:10,910
And if I'm here, the shit
has definitely hit the fan.

73
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:14,290
What exactly is
your area of speciality?

74
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,380
I'm a freelance solution

75
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,720
to some of our
government's problems.

76
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,590
And what might they be?

77
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:27,980
The kind that people don't
usually like to talk about.

78
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:32,240
You hunt people, don't you?

79
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,070
I guess so.

80
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:51,560
You in here, honey?
It's a little late for TV.

81
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:57,610
You in here, honey?

82
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,780
Good evening. I'm Xavier Fitch.

83
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:55,700
I'm in charge of this operation.

84
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:09,140
In November of 1974,
a small group from S.E.T.I. -

85
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:14,190
Search for Extraterrestrial
lntelligence -

86
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,820
sent out a message
to whoever might be listening.

87
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,530
They sent
about 0.25 of a kilobyte,

88
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,490
including structure
of human DNA,

89
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,580
map of our solar system,

90
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:30,040
population of the earth,
helpful facts like that.

91
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,460
In January of 1993,

92
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,390
they received a message back

93
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:40,320
from an extraterrestrial
unknown source.

94
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,560
That's great.

95
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:45,520
Intelligent life
beyond this planet?

96
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,770
Yes.

97
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,190
There were two communications.

98
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:53,230
The first was
a superior catalyst for methane.

99
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,000
We can now produce
an infinite amount of energy

100
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,080
from this clean fuel.

101
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:03,230
This convinced us this was
a friendly intelligence.

102
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:08,060
The second message turned out
to be a new sequence of DNA,

103
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:11,770
with instructions on how
to combine it with ours.

104
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,520
You can get feedback on it
from Dr Baker here.

105
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:20,570
Basically, the new
combined DNA sequence

106
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:26,710
was injected into 100 human ova.

107
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,090
We got seven to divide.

108
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,180
Four petered out.

109
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:36,470
Two were stored
in liquid nitrogen,

110
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,810
and we let one grow.

111
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,570
That's its code name - Sil.

112
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:45,480
That's after two hours...

113
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,400
one day...

114
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,820
two days.

115
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,490
- My God.
- This growth is amazing.

116
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,880
That's a week.

117
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,880
It's a girl.

118
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:00,340
Yes, l...we decided
to make it female

119
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:05,310
so it would be more
docile and controllable.

120
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,530
Controllable?
You guys don't get out much.

121
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:14,410
That's one month
after she was born.

122
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,160
So you kept her caged?

123
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,280
We decided it would be safer.

124
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:23,460
She didn't like being
locked up or being alone.

125
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:27,040
Didn't she?

126
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,680
She's hiding something inside.

127
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,560
You're right, Dan.

128
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:38,100
This is three months
after she was born.

129
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,020
Watch carefully.

130
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:45,820
- What was that?
- Back the tape up.

131
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,450
Watch her eyes.

132
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:54,140
Rapid eye movement...
She's dreaming.

133
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,760
She's having
horrible nightmares.

134
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:59,090
It's some kind
of anxiety reaction.

135
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,940
Got me a little anxious.

136
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,930
It made the research team
anxious, too.

137
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:08,440
The decision was made
to terminate the experiment,

138
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:12,030
to run more research first.

139
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,540
- You were going to gas her?
- That was the decision.

140
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:22,430
It makes you feel bad...

141
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,350
..that you had to kill her.

142
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:28,630
I don't know.

143
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,980
Wow.

144
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:37,110
Yes.

145
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,950
Yesterday morning the body
of a transient was found

146
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,290
in a siding near Salt Lake City.

147
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,830
Preliminary DNA tests conclude

148
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:52,300
he was killed by our creation.

149
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:55,630
- Have you found other bodies?
- No, not yet.

150
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:56,890
You will.

151
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,220
She's a predator.

152
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,600
Her eyes are in front so she can
judge the distance to her prey.

153
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,020
Right.

154
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,070
- Where did you learn that?
- I saw it on a documentary.

155
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:12,870
I caught that show myself.

156
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,950
Mr Lennox.

157
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:16,660
Yeah.

158
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,170
As the non-scientist amongst us,

159
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,460
are you clear
what's going on here?

160
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,630
I think so.

161
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:27,100
You created a monster

162
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:32,700
with some kind of formula
you got from outer space.

163
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:37,570
It got away and you want us
to hunt it down and kill it.

164
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:42,000
- Is that pretty close?
- I guess.

165
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:46,580
You don't want us to capture
her alive and study her?

166
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:51,210
Laura, this is a
search-and-destroy operation.

167
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:56,100
Nobody asks me to find things
they don't want dead.

168
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:58,680
I'm sorry... for you.

169
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:03,620
Yeah, well... thank you, Dan.

170
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:06,750
I'm sorry... for her.

171
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,490
May I have
your attention, please.

172
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:13,910
Welcome to Los Angeles,
California.

173
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:19,340
All passengers please disembark.

174
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:55,980
This is the final boarding call
for train number 12

175
00:24:56,070 --> 00:25:03,030
to Santa Barbara, San José,
San Francisco and Seattle.

176
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,120
- Something bad happened here.
- No shit?

177
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:41,880
Crushed her larynx.

178
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:45,170
She was afraid.
She's frightened.

179
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:48,550
Hungry, too, by the looks of it.

180
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:52,430
She's definitely not on a diet.

181
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,560
She's storing up calories.

182
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:59,900
- Any ideas?
- Oh, my...!

183
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:05,790
Well, that looks like
some sort of...chrysalis,

184
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,080
some kind of cocoon.

185
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,670
Are we looking for a giant moth?

186
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:15,970
If that is a cocoon,
she'll be fully-grown now.

187
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,800
Fully-grown.

188
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:22,310
Our people were looking
for a child.

189
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,230
She is a child.

190
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,770
It stinks in here.
I'm going outside.

191
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,920
Get the conductor's lD...
and credit card numbers.

192
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:43,090
Let's assume she took
them with her.

193
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,260
I'll see to that.

194
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:48,890
She kills
if she feels threatened,

195
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:52,060
and has no remorse.

196
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,440
Los Angeles is perfect
for her. Anything goes.

197
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:59,480
Very little is taboo
or unacceptable.

198
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,830
Whatever she does,
no one's going to notice.

199
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:09,380
Well, Los Angeles is where
the battle will be fought...

200
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:12,920
and won.

201
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:40,640
You look very pretty.

202
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:44,360
Do you have a hundred?

203
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:47,070
Here we are.

204
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,330
You ought to be more careful
with your money.

205
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:54,750
Not every. body's as honest as me.

206
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:58,880
Are you foreign?

207
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,830
Do you speak English?

208
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,670
Yes.

209
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,180
Here. You keep this.

210
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:10,440
Here, let me take this.

211
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,400
Be careful here.

212
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,780
Yes.

213
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,080
Watch your step.

214
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,100
Our laboratory is being moved

215
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:40,680
to some empty virus research
labs at the university.

216
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:43,970
It'll be operational by 8.00.

217
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:49,150
- We'll go over in 15 minutes.
- What are we going to do?

218
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,330
Process the evidence
we collected on the train.

219
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:57,910
Couldn't we grow this creature
with just its own DNA,

220
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:01,380
so we can investigate
its vulnerabilities?

221
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:05,310
That'd be good.
Like to know how it feels.

222
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:08,230
If we could see it
without the camouflage...

223
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:12,900
Then we'd know what
we're dealing with.

224
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:11,450
Couple of bozos just ran out.

225
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:14,870
Yes, young lady, can I help you?

226
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,830
I want a room.

227
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:20,400
62, including tax.

228
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,400
Hi. Come here often?

229
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:45,940
What's your sign?

230
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:57,460
Tired of brunette?

231
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,050
Change the colour of your hair.

232
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:03,840
Colour-tress.

233
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:15,150
I've just increased
the magnification.

234
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,370
When I pierce the cell,

235
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:25,170
the foreign DNA
will be introduced.

236
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,230
Shit! The camera's
just gone down.

237
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,940
Um...excuse me.

238
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,280
Do you have a replacement?

239
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:46,030
Yes, but it'll take time
for a technician to come over.

240
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,990
It's a simple operation
to replace it.

241
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:51,960
Are you saying you can do it?

242
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:55,710
Sure. I just need somebody
to give me a hand.

243
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:59,510
- No technicians in there.
- I'll do it.

244
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,890
I'll do it.

245
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,680
- A man of action.
- That's me.

246
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:19,540
Can you get that one for me?

247
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:45,290
Give me the camera.

248
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:59,940
Something's...something's wrong.

249
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,610
Christ, it's started already.

250
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,000
Get the top back on.

251
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:13,000
- What?
- Get the top back on.

252
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,970
Here you go.

253
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:19,620
It's penetrated the cell.

254
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,800
He dropped the bolt.

255
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:28,560
- Find the bolt.
- I'm looking, Fitch.

256
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,900
Can they hear me?

257
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:36,660
Get the top back on
then I'll let you out.

258
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:45,210
- It fell through the grate.
- Can you lift it?

259
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,710
This isn't going to work!

260
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,420
Get the bolt
from under the grate!

261
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:56,070
- The floor's welded down.
- Oh, my God!

262
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:59,820
God, I've never seen
anything like this.

263
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,870
I can't let them out.

264
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,940
Come on!

265
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,910
Fitch, let us out of here!

266
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,070
Open the goddamn door!

267
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:12,380
Not till I know what's in there.

268
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:15,680
- Let them out!
- I can't!

269
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,560
Tell me it's going
to stop growing, Dan.

270
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:27,900
- Open the door!
- Press!

271
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,230
What the fuck is that?

272
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,790
Laura, get to the other door!

273
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:37,080
- Let her out, Fitch!
- I can't do that.

274
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:39,920
- Motherfucker!
- What's wrong with you?

275
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,670
It's breaking out.

276
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,850
I'll burn it! Out of the way!

277
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:54,480
If you can't destroy it,
I have to burn the whole room.

278
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:57,490
You got two minutes to kill it.

279
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:02,160
Use the gas line
as a flame-thrower.

280
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:07,280
It's under the table!

281
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:17,920
- Open the door!
- Shut up, Dan!

282
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:22,810
One minute remaining.

283
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,210
It stopped moving.
I think I killed it.

284
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,510
It's dead. Open the door.

285
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:42,930
Let them out.

286
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:48,730
Oh, God, it's not dead.

287
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,730
What will we do?

288
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:00,500
30 seconds remaining.

289
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,290
Open the door!

290
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:05,910
- Let them out!
- I have to follow protocol.

291
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,410
- Protocol?
- For running this experiment.

292
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:10,970
You didn't tell them that!

293
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:13,130
Fitch, let them out.

294
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:18,650
- Let them out!
- I have to follow protocol.

295
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:20,820
Get out!

296
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:23,990
3...2...1.

297
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:26,070
I had no choice!

298
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,830
We burn the room
if anything goes wrong.

299
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,070
Where can I find a man?

300
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:56,550
There's plenty of guys
at the ld round the corner.

301
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,590
You'll meet somebody there.

302
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,250
Thank you.

303
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:03,210
Just look for the long line.

304
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:05,680
Oh, I need your credit card,

305
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:09,600
for long-distance calls,
room damage, so forth.

306
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:11,020
Credit card?

307
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,650
Plastic...Amex, Visa?

308
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:18,080
There you go. Thanks.

309
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:21,650
Hey, wait a minute.

310
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:27,370
You don't want this
falling into the wrong hands.

311
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:30,540
No.

312
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:37,970
Yeah.

313
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:41,100
The conductor's
credit card has turned up.

314
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,240
Let's go.

315
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,910
You two.

316
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,830
Enjoy yourself.

317
00:37:55,930 --> 00:38:00,510
You, legs, you're in.

318
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:24,000
Hey, where are you from?

319
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,490
- I'm foreign.
- You're what?

320
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,960
I'm foreign.

321
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,920
Foreign, really?

322
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:32,250
I've a party to go to

323
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:35,260
and no one to take me.

324
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:39,840
- I'll take you.
- You will?

325
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:44,600
I'm going to go to the little
girls' room. Wait here.

326
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:48,650
I'll be right here.

327
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,410
What's his name,
Greg or something?

328
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,440
Whatever it takes, right?

329
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,020
Hey, all's fair in love and war.

330
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:19,980
Buddy.

331
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,350
Can't see much on that.

332
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,350
Get this tape back
to the lab. Enhance it.

333
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,520
She looks nice.

334
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:47,950
Have you any idea
where she went?

335
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,750
I'll find her.

336
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:55,300
She wanted to meet a man.
I suggested the ld.

337
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:59,380
Get the tape.

338
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:20,210
I've a party to go to
and no one to take me.

339
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:24,990
- Where is this party?
- I don't know.

340
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,230
You can't park there.

341
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,860
You can't go in there.

342
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,660
What's going on here?

343
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,390
Nobody leaves the club, nobody.

344
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:08,320
There's always some action
in this part of town.

345
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:24,250
..blue-eyed blonde.
Who did she leave with?

346
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:27,930
Blue-eyed blonde leaving
with a guy is hardly news.

347
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,060
Name the top attractions.

348
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,640
Assume he's socially adept.

349
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:36,100
A friendly guy, not an asshole.

350
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:40,490
- Robbie left with a blonde.
- That's him.

351
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,330
Let me show you
the rest of the house.

352
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:45,420
Let me show you
the rest of the house.

353
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:50,840
I'm still sweaty
from that place.

354
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:56,220
Like it?

355
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:57,930
Yes.

356
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:02,570
I feel like a shower.
You want one?

357
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,280
I'm going to take one.

358
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:10,480
Want to get in
and take one later?

359
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:56,190
Take off your clothes.

360
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,260
I want to see you.

361
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,860
Very nice.

362
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:21,710
- Can you drive me back?
- What are you talking about?

363
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:26,360
- You know why we came here.
- I've changed my mind.

364
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,600
All right. You said no.

365
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,930
It's duly noted. Come here.

366
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:36,910
- I said I want to go.
- You're not leaving!

367
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,620
All right.

368
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:43,250
That's better.

369
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:13,750
What's happening?
Kills a girl, kills this guy.

370
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:17,710
She fits the classic
definition of a psychopath.

371
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,790
Nothing to inhibit her,

372
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:22,420
no moral sense,
no social structure.

373
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:26,340
She wasn't exactly smothered
with a mother's love.

374
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,510
I asked what was happening.

375
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:31,440
He did something to her.
She was angry .

376
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:34,400
She'll kill anyone
that gets in her way.

377
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:36,520
In her way of what?

378
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:40,320
Her life cycle. I think
she's trying to mate, reproduce.

379
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:43,830
So why did she kill the girl?

380
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,580
- Sexual competition.
- She's hard on the competition.

381
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,300
Now she's mated.

382
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:53,520
No. He's still got his pants on.

383
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,970
- She's frustrated.
- Who isn't?

384
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,430
What is her problem?

385
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:00,640
Maybe she rejected him.

386
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:03,490
She probably has
some special senses.

387
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:07,360
Rats can sense genetic damage
in potential mates.

388
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:10,820
We can test his body
for any defects

389
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,830
that would have made him
a loser, essentially.

390
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:20,000
Needles. Maybe he was some
kind of doper or diabetic.

391
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:25,180
Either way would have
made him unacceptable.

392
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:28,030
All right.

393
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,730
Insulin. Diabetic.
There you have it.

394
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:36,700
- But why kill him?
- I guess he pissed her off.

395
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:39,410
Some men don't like rejection.

396
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:42,590
Put an APB out
on this guy's car.

397
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:45,710
I want to check out the motel.

398
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:50,220
More docile and controllable?

399
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,450
What do you think, Dan?

400
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:08,210
I think she'd want to be alone.

401
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:13,250
I don't think she'll come here
with all these cars out front.

402
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:16,180
Could she find
her way back here?

403
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:17,970
She could.

404
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,690
What is it?

405
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,970
Maybe menstrual blood.

406
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:27,200
If she's menstruating,
she's capable of reproduction.

407
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,770
Yes, I know.

408
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,800
Oh, Jesus.

409
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,720
- Excuse me.
- Call the paramedic!

410
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,250
The video enhancement
is not all that great.

411
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:43,260
How old do you think
she is? 20? 23?

412
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:46,510
Her reproductive system
should be fully developed.

413
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,970
Her biological clock
must be in hyperdrive.

414
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,770
She wants a baby.

415
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:54,070
If her offspring's male

416
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:57,350
and develops
at the same rate as Sil,

417
00:49:57,450 --> 00:50:01,150
it could be capable
of reproduction in six months.

418
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:05,570
God knows how many females
it could impregnate.

419
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,580
Fitch.

420
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:11,370
When a predatory
species is introduced

421
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:13,880
into a closed
ecological system,

422
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:16,460
the extinction of the weaker
species is inevitable.

423
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,560
They found
the murdered guy's BMW.

424
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:22,350
- And what is her name?
- I don't know.

425
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,930
So who are you?

426
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:27,940
Thought I'd come by
to make sure she's O.K.

427
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:29,990
Is she insured?

428
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:33,420
I don't know.
Put it on my credit card.

429
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:38,290
Guys like you are hard to find.

430
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:48,420
Get a lab workup on that, stat.

431
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:52,260
Arrange to get her up to X-ray.

432
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:57,040
It looks like
a scapula fracture.

433
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:08,070
Your sh...your shoulder.

434
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:11,950
What's going on?

435
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,660
Doctor, we need you.

436
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:21,840
- A burn victim just came in.
- What's going on here?

437
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,500
Did you see her shoulder?

438
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:29,210
Doctor, please.
We need you immediately!

439
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,240
- You're O.K.
- I'm OK.

440
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:41,410
I was sure you
were seriously injured.

441
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:43,040
I'm OK.

442
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:46,910
- It's a miracle.
- Can we go?

443
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,330
Did the doctor say you could?

444
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:52,340
Yes.

445
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:53,330
We'll send somebody over.

446
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:56,990
We'll send somebody over.

447
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,920
A doctor at Parkbay Hospital

448
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:02,560
called in with some weird story .

449
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,850
We should check it out.

450
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:08,770
Laura, Press,
take a car. Check it out.

451
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:10,570
Parkbay Hospital?

452
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:13,360
Yeah, Parkbay.

453
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:15,660
She walked.

454
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:19,040
She walked.

455
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,540
That way.

456
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:24,700
Not too long ago.

457
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:35,060
Got some fruit and cheese here.

458
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:38,570
- What is that?
- What, the hot tub?

459
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:40,730
Hot tub.

460
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:43,400
I love this place.

461
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:49,290
It's away from the traffic
and all the people.

462
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:54,210
Here. We'll immortalise
the moment.

463
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,270
Look at the camera.

464
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,230
She reformed her bone structure!

465
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:15,820
- It's her.
- Who checked her in?

466
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:17,790
Let's find out.

467
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:22,550
This guy put it
on his own credit card.

468
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,640
Here's the file.
John F. Carey.

469
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,600
You haven't got
a driver's licence,

470
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,520
home address,
social security number?

471
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,230
I only got an imprint
of his credit card.

472
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:37,320
Can you give us a print-out?

473
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,640
No problem.

474
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:44,650
Want some candy?

475
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:57,050
It's an address in the
Palisades and a phone number.

476
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:02,590
Tell Fitch where we're headed,
and try to call Carey.

477
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,630
I better get the phone.

478
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:41,590
I've got his machine.

479
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,230
Tell him he's about to copulate

480
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:46,860
with a creature
from outer space.

481
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:50,910
- Copulate?
- Yeah.

482
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,120
I like you.

483
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,200
I know.

484
00:54:57,870 --> 00:55:01,410
It's not too soon
for us to be together.

485
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:05,470
No, it's not too soon.

486
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:08,220
You don't need these.

487
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:12,020
Hey, that's a little fast.

488
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,210
What's the matter?

489
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:28,750
Take it easy.

490
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:36,040
Just relax.
There's plenty of time.

491
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:46,360
What is it?

492
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:52,230
- I think someone's at the door.
- Don't go. Please.

493
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:56,500
- I want a baby.
- What?

494
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:09,970
Let's go around the side.

495
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:53,620
- What happened?
- It was a fucking squirrel.

496
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:56,560
- She was here?
- Yeah, she was.

497
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:01,230
Make sure she's not still here.

498
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,470
Perhaps we should check the body

499
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:31,190
for any evidence
they've had sex.

500
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,650
I used to be scared of blood.

501
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:42,040
Now I guess
I'm getting used to it.

502
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,670
Oh, yes?

503
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:10,950
- Hey!
- Please help me!

504
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:12,660
What's the matter?

505
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:15,950
We found this
in the living room.

506
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:19,700
She liked him.

507
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:22,300
Well, not enough.

508
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:26,000
Can't see any more on that
than we did on the video.

509
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:29,350
He didn't get
a very good picture of her.

510
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:31,640
There's no semen in the water.

511
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:34,440
Maybe she took it with her.

512
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:37,860
- She hasn't mated.
- We interrupted her.

513
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:42,490
I think we did.
Give me something I can use!

514
01:00:42,570 --> 01:00:46,400
What have YOU come up with?

515
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:55,090
She's not scared of us,
that's for sure.

516
01:00:56,390 --> 01:01:01,300
We're all beat.
We'll go to the hotel and rest.

517
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:05,900
Tomorrow night...
we'll go back to the club...

518
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:09,810
..stake it out.

519
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:12,990
She's not stupid.

520
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,320
She won't repeat herself.

521
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:18,540
And it provided
such a poor specimen.

522
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:20,630
I'm not so sure.

523
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:23,010
It's what she knows.

524
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:29,930
I'd rather try the club than
sit around the command centre.

525
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:47,240
She would make one
excellent biological weapon

526
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:51,120
if someone out there thought
we were a galactic weed.

527
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:57,430
You're saying she's the cure
and we're the disease?

528
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,600
That's well said.

529
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:02,070
"Baker, Laura.

530
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:06,530
"1735 Meander rive,
Simi Valley, California."

531
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:10,070
- That's you, right?
- Last time I checked.

532
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,490
What do you do
for kicks out there?

533
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:16,630
Oh, pine for guys like you.

534
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:20,420
That's what I thought.

535
01:02:39,370 --> 01:02:41,370
Anyone hungry?

536
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:44,130
No, thanks. I'm beat.

537
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:46,760
I'll just try to get some sleep.

538
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:48,550
Good night.

539
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:51,430
I'll have something
to eat with you.

540
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:54,680
Thanks, Dan.

541
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:58,110
- Do you ever have nightmares?
- Yes.

542
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:02,110
Please untie my hands.
I wouldn't hurt you.

543
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:09,000
I have them. I think
they tell me who I am.

544
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:13,080
Why are you doing this to me?

545
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:15,760
I don't know why I'm here.

546
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:21,270
I don't know who I am,
who sent me. Do you?

547
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:24,400
No.

548
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:26,990
Why do you think you're here?

549
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:29,200
I don't know.

550
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,740
Please let me go.

551
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:36,250
Please, please let me go.

552
01:04:36,670 --> 01:04:38,660
I wouldn't hurt you.

553
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:41,460
I promise,
I wouldn't hurt you.

554
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:42,930
Yes, you would.

555
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:45,250
You just don't know it yet.

556
01:04:45,350 --> 01:04:47,470
No, I wouldn't!

557
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:51,050
Please.

558
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:55,680
My hands are hurting me.

559
01:04:56,780 --> 01:04:59,990
Oh, hey, thank you.

560
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:03,290
Thank you.

561
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:10,760
Oh, my God!

562
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:28,910
Oh, my God, no!

563
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:32,490
No!

564
01:07:30,090 --> 01:07:33,340
Laura and Press like each other.

565
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:35,890
They just don't like
to show how it.

566
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:39,810
- What?
- They like each other.

567
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:42,020
Whatever you say, Dan.

568
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:45,440
I'm going to get a bit of air.

569
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:48,140
I'll lie down in the van.

570
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:51,620
This is a waste of time.

571
01:07:51,870 --> 01:07:55,240
Get the feeling
you're on a wild-goose chase?

572
01:07:55,330 --> 01:07:59,870
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

573
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:03,550
Get out of here.
This is my trash can!

574
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:16,200
It's you.

575
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,410
She's here!

576
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:37,810
- Dan, is that her?
- Yeah, she's over here.

577
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:49,450
Everybody get in the van!

578
01:09:55,970 --> 01:10:00,430
We'll need the helicopters.

579
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:16,610
Try and block her at Mulholland.

580
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:35,100
Watch it!

581
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:38,610
My God.

582
01:12:10,750 --> 01:12:13,670
We blocked the road
in both directions.

583
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:16,500
We've got to tell
the press something.

584
01:12:16,590 --> 01:12:19,130
Just don't tell them the truth.

585
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:22,500
I don't buy her
showing up at the club.

586
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:25,430
or don't you trust your eyes?

587
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:28,090
Get all these people back!

588
01:12:28,190 --> 01:12:31,150
Fitch, it doesn't feel right.

589
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:34,360
We found what looks
like a severed thumb

590
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:36,610
in the pocket of a door.

591
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:40,240
She may have caught it,
trying to get out.

592
01:12:40,330 --> 01:12:46,760
The lab will determine
if it's hers.

593
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,380
It's all over.

594
01:12:48,470 --> 01:12:52,380
You can go back to your lives.

595
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:59,360
Just like that, huh, Fitch?
I don't think so.

596
01:13:07,410 --> 01:13:10,250
Hi, Chucklets.

597
01:13:10,330 --> 01:13:12,320
Leave me a message.

598
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:17,050
And, Frank,
where are we meeting?

599
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:18,220
Waiter.

600
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:19,680
Waiter.

601
01:13:19,930 --> 01:13:22,420
Well, I guess we won.

602
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:25,800
We won. Science lost.

603
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:29,570
I didn't think
we'd get her this easy.

604
01:13:29,650 --> 01:13:32,030
Sounds like you'll miss her.

605
01:13:32,110 --> 01:13:35,540
I think I respected her.

606
01:13:35,790 --> 01:13:38,110
This has been a hellish job,

607
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:42,080
but I've really enjoyed
working with you three.

608
01:13:42,170 --> 01:13:45,340
Why don't we have another round?

609
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:48,140
- Waiter!
- I don't drink, Art.

610
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:50,770
Tonight you will.

611
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:53,010
Want to dance?

612
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:57,180
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you.

613
01:13:58,190 --> 01:13:59,530
All right.

614
01:13:59,610 --> 01:14:02,600
OK.

615
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:19,270
I know you don't have a family.

616
01:14:19,350 --> 01:14:21,930
Do you have a girlfriend?

617
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:26,350
I've had a few, but they
don't hang around long.

618
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:29,200
I keep too many secrets.

619
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,360
Want to share one with me?

620
01:14:31,450 --> 01:14:34,830
Right now?

621
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:42,830
Well, I know what you do,
and it doesn't scare me.

622
01:14:42,930 --> 01:14:45,170
- Really?
- No.

623
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:49,470
Well, it does most people.

624
01:14:51,650 --> 01:14:56,270
I wouldn't want
to never see you again.

625
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:08,590
I'm sorry... I thought
you were somebody else.

626
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:14,500
- You OK?
- I thought it was Sil.

627
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:19,010
She's dead.
Tests on the thumb proved it.

628
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:22,940
You got your test. I got my gut.

629
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:28,870
Maybe you don't want
this job to be over.

630
01:15:28,950 --> 01:15:30,410
Maybe not.

631
01:15:30,490 --> 01:15:34,150
So what?

632
01:15:35,290 --> 01:15:39,090
Thanks for the dance.

633
01:15:51,730 --> 01:15:55,230
Good night.

634
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:04,530
- What do you call this?
- A Long lsland lced Tea.

635
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:07,300
It's got tea in it?

636
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:10,760
Nope.

637
01:16:25,770 --> 01:16:28,810
Smells nice. Can I try some?

638
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:32,400
Help yourself.

639
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:38,250
Does it work on your boyfriend?

640
01:16:38,330 --> 01:16:42,130
Yeah, as a repellent.

641
01:16:42,590 --> 01:16:49,060
He's in remarkably good shape
for a man his age.

642
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:02,270
One Long lsland lced Tea.

643
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:07,290
I like this cup...
these cups of tea.

644
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:08,950
What?

645
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,090
- That's great.
- What?

646
01:17:11,170 --> 01:17:14,550
What?

647
01:17:14,970 --> 01:17:18,480
Hey, give me one of those.

648
01:17:18,730 --> 01:17:21,350
I like these cups of tea.

649
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:26,530
You guys, I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.

650
01:17:27,070 --> 01:17:29,700
So?

651
01:17:29,950 --> 01:17:32,280
She's going to bed.

652
01:17:32,370 --> 01:17:34,870
I guess.

653
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:41,200
She still, uh...
wants to see you, though.

654
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:47,590
Maybe I'll go find out
if you're right.

655
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:14,880
Hate to be in this
during an earthquake.

656
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:17,630
Yeah. What floor do you want?

657
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:21,260
10, please.

658
01:18:29,230 --> 01:18:31,560
I like your perfume.

659
01:18:31,650 --> 01:18:35,020
You do? Thank you.

660
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:39,540
Excuse me. I get out here.

661
01:18:41,170 --> 01:18:44,710
Good night.

662
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:11,700
Yes!

663
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:23,340
- Hi.
- Hi.

664
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,620
Did you want something?

665
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:46,000
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

666
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:33,080
Housekeeping.

667
01:20:33,330 --> 01:20:36,250
Dan, those two over there.

668
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:39,760
I bet they like
unusual men like us.

669
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:43,540
Women think I'm strange.

670
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:49,480
- I don't feel well.
- Just go and talk to them

671
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:53,950
I have to go. I think
you should leave with me.

672
01:20:54,030 --> 01:20:59,530
I'm going to stay
for a while, actually.

673
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:01,990
OK.

674
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:05,790
I'll see you tomorrow.

675
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:10,680
Housekeeping.

676
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:25,020
Hi.

677
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:26,280
- Hi.
- Hi.

678
01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:28,440
I couldn't help wondering

679
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:32,670
what two very intelligent,
glamorous-looking women

680
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:34,580
were doing without dates.

681
01:21:34,670 --> 01:21:36,750
I teach anthropology
at Harvard.

682
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:41,000
I lived in Boston for a year.
Froze my butt off.

683
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:45,770
This is Bill and Tony.

684
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:52,410
Give me those socks.

685
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:56,030
Stand up.

686
01:22:34,570 --> 01:22:37,530
- How'd you get in here?
- I stole the key.

687
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:39,870
What?

688
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:42,420
I saw you downstairs

689
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:46,750
and thought
I'd come up and wait.

690
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:51,600
Whoa! This kind of thing
doesn't happen to me.

691
01:22:51,850 --> 01:22:56,020
I just want to be with you.

692
01:23:04,530 --> 01:23:08,580
Oh, yes. Yes!

693
01:23:08,830 --> 01:23:12,290
Oh, yes.

694
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:23,350
What about protection?

695
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:20,680
She's here. She's here.

696
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:50,270
- Press?
- Huh?

697
01:24:50,350 --> 01:24:52,770
Someone's at the door.

698
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:54,860
Who's there?

699
01:24:54,940 --> 01:24:58,700
It's Dan. I got to talk to you.

700
01:24:58,780 --> 01:25:02,830
Christ, what does he want?

701
01:25:10,630 --> 01:25:13,340
What's the problem, Dan?

702
01:25:13,430 --> 01:25:16,520
I just got
this terrible feeling.

703
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:19,140
Sil's next door
with Arden, Press.

704
01:25:19,230 --> 01:25:22,020
No, no, no. She's dead.

705
01:25:22,110 --> 01:25:25,810
There's somebody with him.

706
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:28,060
Did you knock on the door?

707
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:29,530
Yeah.

708
01:25:29,620 --> 01:25:32,200
They're making a lot of noise.

709
01:25:32,290 --> 01:25:37,330
They're having sex.
I KNOW it's Sil.

710
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:41,620
OK, I'll get dressed.

711
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:53,360
Oh, my God.

712
01:25:54,990 --> 01:25:59,370
Well, I enjoyed that immensely.

713
01:26:15,940 --> 01:26:20,520
- I felt it.
- What?

714
01:26:21,690 --> 01:26:23,910
It's started.

715
01:26:23,990 --> 01:26:25,780
What's started?

716
01:26:25,870 --> 01:26:27,700
Life.

717
01:26:27,790 --> 01:26:30,540
Oh, my darling girl...

718
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:32,750
I know some women believe

719
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:35,880
they know the exact moment
of conception...

720
01:26:35,970 --> 01:26:39,430
Don't you believe me? Feel.

721
01:26:42,770 --> 01:26:45,270
Holy shit!

722
01:26:50,290 --> 01:26:54,830
I hope you're right
about this, Dan.

723
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:06,770
She's headed for the basement!

724
01:27:06,850 --> 01:27:12,030
We'll take the stairs!
Laura, come with me.

725
01:27:12,110 --> 01:27:14,200
If she's pregnant,

726
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:18,070
we got to get to her
before she gives birth.

727
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:21,700
We don't know what
we're dealing with.

728
01:27:21,790 --> 01:27:25,500
She could have a dozen babies,
lay 1,000 eggs.

729
01:27:25,550 --> 01:27:30,180
- God, did you see Arden?
- Yeah, the poor bastard.

730
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:33,350
If they make it,
we'll have her trapped.

731
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:37,730
The fire doors
only open from inside.

732
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,360
Holy shit.

733
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:43,570
The bitch went right
through a steel door.

734
01:27:43,660 --> 01:27:47,870
Fitch! Dan! She got past us.

735
01:27:57,140 --> 01:27:58,930
You saw her?

736
01:27:59,010 --> 01:28:02,060
She was gone before we got here.

737
01:28:02,140 --> 01:28:04,550
Look at the door.

738
01:28:04,650 --> 01:28:09,230
- Where's Press?
- Down that tunnel.

739
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:27,140
She kills
if she feels threatened.

740
01:28:48,710 --> 01:28:53,470
She must have come through here.

741
01:29:11,740 --> 01:29:15,360
She went down here.
There's no other way.

742
01:29:15,460 --> 01:29:20,340
- Yeah. She's down there.
- Let's go.

743
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:25,510
Stand back. I'll clear it out.

744
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:17,920
Which way do you think
she went, Dan?

745
01:30:18,010 --> 01:30:21,710
I don't know. I'm not sure.

746
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:24,560
Think, for Christ's sake!

747
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:28,900
You're supposed to have
extrasensory powers.

748
01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:31,140
Which way did she go, Dan?

749
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:34,820
- I don't know.
- Which way did she go?

750
01:30:34,910 --> 01:30:38,160
I think she went that way.

751
01:30:38,250 --> 01:30:40,570
That's good enough for me.

752
01:30:40,670 --> 01:30:45,830
You think, but you don't
fucking know, do you?

753
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:49,710
I'm going this way.
Come with me, Dan!

754
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:55,350
I think...l think
she went this way.

755
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:05,910
What happened?

756
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:16,430
I can feel her. She's that way.

757
01:32:16,510 --> 01:32:20,090
She's that way.

758
01:32:23,190 --> 01:32:29,270
I never thought I'd
want to kill something.

759
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:07,670
It's this way. It's back here.

760
01:33:36,670 --> 01:33:40,840
Hey, she went in here.

761
01:33:43,140 --> 01:33:48,020
This must have opened up
during the earthquake.

762
01:33:48,110 --> 01:33:51,930
OK, stand back.

763
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:05,130
Wow.

764
01:35:06,310 --> 01:35:10,680
- Is that oil?
- Looks like it.

765
01:35:16,540 --> 01:35:19,700
I'll see if I can flush her out.

766
01:35:19,790 --> 01:35:25,150
If she comes back here,
let her have it.

767
01:36:39,990 --> 01:36:42,470
Dan, what is it?

768
01:36:42,580 --> 01:36:46,150
I don't know.

769
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,710
OK...

770
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:13,120
It's OK.

771
01:38:13,210 --> 01:38:15,830
Nobody's going to hurt you.

772
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:20,090
You come here. Come on.

773
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:23,920
Come on. I got ya.

774
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:31,680
Press, something's
happened to Dan!

775
01:38:34,910 --> 01:38:37,980
Shit!

776
01:38:40,790 --> 01:38:46,160
Dan? I'm stuck.

777
01:38:47,970 --> 01:38:54,430
I need your help. I'm stuck!

778
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:24,900
Dan, hang on.

779
01:39:35,290 --> 01:39:38,570
Hang on!

780
01:40:15,630 --> 01:40:19,760
Don't fall!

781
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:46,710
Hang on, Dan!

782
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:49,510
Hang on!

783
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:51,600
I got you!

784
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:56,630
I got you, Dan. Hang on.

785
01:41:07,660 --> 01:41:11,210
Hang on, Dan!

786
01:41:14,010 --> 01:41:17,830
Get rid of her, Press!

787
01:41:19,140 --> 01:41:22,520
Duck your head!

788
01:41:22,770 --> 01:41:26,980
Let go, you motherfucker.

789
01:41:28,150 --> 01:41:32,530
I got you. Hold on.

790
01:41:35,910 --> 01:41:39,870
I thought I was dead.

791
01:41:41,420 --> 01:41:44,840
I thought you drank your
last Long lsland lced Tea there.

792
01:41:44,930 --> 01:41:48,100
I thought we all had.

793
01:41:48,350 --> 01:41:50,590
You OK?

794
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:52,810
Yeah, I'm OK.

795
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:55,820
My pants are a little messed up,

796
01:41:55,900 --> 01:41:59,490
but I'm OK.

797
01:41:59,910 --> 01:42:02,700
She was half us,
half something else.

798
01:42:02,790 --> 01:42:05,660
Which was the predatory half?

799
01:42:05,750 --> 01:42:08,630
The dead half.

800
01:42:08,710 --> 01:42:12,760
Let's get out of here.

801
01:42:53,150 --> 01:42:56,070
I never thought I'd be so happy

802
01:42:56,160 --> 01:43:00,490
to be back in a sewer.

803
01:46:46,860 --> 01:46:51,950
