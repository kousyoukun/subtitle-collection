1
00:01:05,921 --> 00:01:10,983
For those who haven't read the plaque, we'll read the plaque.

2
00:01:11,093 --> 00:01:15,791
Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the moon.

3
00:01:15,897 --> 00:01:17,955
July 1969.

4
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,526
We came in peace for all mankind.

5
00:03:01,796 --> 00:03:05,230
If this isn't an insanely beautiful woman, I'm hanging up.

6
00:03:05,298 --> 00:03:08,424
Sir, I think you should listen to this.

7
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:19,702
Goddamn it! Sir?

8
00:03:20,511 --> 00:03:23,240
Come on, baby. Come on!

9
00:03:23,315 --> 00:03:26,249
This better not be another damn Russian spy job!

10
00:03:26,317 --> 00:03:28,613
Air traffic says the skies are clear.

11
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,712
It's the real thing. A radio signal from another world

12
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:34,916
Let's not jump the gun here.

13
00:03:35,026 --> 00:03:38,255
Get online with Space Command. They're gonna want to know

14
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:40,762
What's with the golf balls? You're gonna kill me!

15
00:03:40,215 --> 00:03:42,374
Wait, this can't be right.

16
00:03:42,451 --> 00:03:47,887
The calculated distance from source is only 375,000km.

17
00:03:50,691 --> 00:03:53,817
It's coming from the moon.

18
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:09,806
Who else knows about this? SETI in New Mexico identified a signal.

19
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:13,537
But, they're even more confused than we are, sir.

20
00:04:20,018 --> 00:04:22,246
Major! Yes, sir.

21
00:04:22,321 --> 00:04:26,915
Radar reception has been impaired, but we were able to get these.

22
00:04:27,025 --> 00:04:31,255
We estimate that it has a diameter of over 550km

23
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:35,059
and a mass roughly one fourth the size of our moon.

24
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,633
What the hell is it? A meteor?

25
00:04:37,701 --> 00:04:40,498
No, sir. No, definitely not.

26
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:43,435
How do you know? Well, sir, it's slowing down.

27
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:48,069
It's what? It's slowing down, sir.

28
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,785
Get me the Secretary of Defense.

29
00:05:04,582 --> 00:05:05,672
Hello. Hi.

30
00:05:05,783 --> 00:05:08,182
It's me. Hi.

31
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,682
What time is it there? It's 2.45 in the morning.

32
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:16,188
I know I didn't wake you. As a matter of fact, you did.

33
00:05:16,294 --> 00:05:18,385
Liar

34
00:05:19,563 --> 00:05:21,393
I have a confession to make.

35
00:05:21,464 --> 00:05:26,560
I'm sleeping next to a beautiful, young brunette.

36
00:05:26,636 --> 00:05:29,035
You didn't let her stay up watching TV?

37
00:05:29,104 --> 00:05:31,697
Did you? Of course not. You're coming home

38
00:05:31,774 --> 00:05:34,435
right after the luncheon? Yes, yes.

39
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:37,444
Mommy? Here's your mother.

40
00:05:39,648 --> 00:05:43,242
Hi, honey! I miss you.

41
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:48,449
President Whitmore's approval ratings have slipped below 40%

42
00:05:48,524 --> 00:05:49,648
He's good.

43
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:53,455
Are the salad days over for President Whitmore?

44
00:05:53,528 --> 00:05:58,020
Leadership as a Gulf War pilot is different from leadership in politics

45
00:05:58,098 --> 00:06:01,032
Daddy let me watch Letterman.

46
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:02,328
Traitor

47
00:06:02,435 --> 00:06:03,731
They elected a warrior and got a wimp.

48
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:08,430
Morning, George. Morning, Mr.. President

49
00:06:08,504 --> 00:06:11,131
That game couldn't have been pretty.

50
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,433
Thank you, sir.

51
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:16,840
Connie, you're up awfully early this morning.

52
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:21,543
They're not attacking your policies, they're attacking your age.

53
00:06:21,616 --> 00:06:27,780
Whitmore seems less like the President and
more like the orphaned child Oliver asking

54
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:30,850
Please, sir, I'd like some more.

55
00:06:31,456 --> 00:06:33,786
That's clever. I'm not laughing.

56
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:39,278
Age was not an issue when you stuck to your
guns. You were seen as young, idealistic...

57
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,065
Now the message has gotten lost.

58
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:45,360
It's too much politics, too much compromise.

59
00:06:45,703 --> 00:06:49,502
Isn't it amazing how quickly everyone can turn against you?

60
00:06:50,768 --> 00:06:54,328
Mr. President, it's the Secretary of Defense.

61
00:06:57,139 --> 00:06:58,435
Yes.

62
00:07:00,877 --> 00:07:03,868
Could you say that again?

63
00:07:46,364 --> 00:07:48,455
So why are you waiting?

64
00:07:48,566 --> 00:07:51,659
My Social Security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.

65
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,603
I'm thinking. Yeah, well, think already!

66
00:08:02,813 --> 00:08:06,110
Do you know how long it takes for those cups to decompose?

67
00:08:06,216 --> 00:08:09,878
If you don't move soon, I'll start to decompose.

68
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,846
Listen, David, I've been meaning to talk with you.

69
00:08:18,495 --> 00:08:22,123
It's nice that you see me so much now...Don't start, Dad.

70
00:08:22,231 --> 00:08:26,393
It's been... what? Four years? You're still wearing a wedding band?

71
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:29,834
Three years. You're divorced, move on.

72
00:08:29,906 --> 00:08:33,864
This is not healthy. No, the smoking is not healthy.

73
00:08:38,246 --> 00:08:40,439
Checkmate.

74
00:08:40,514 --> 00:08:42,673
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

75
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,276
Wait. This is not checkmate. See you tomorrow, Pop.

76
00:08:46,354 --> 00:08:48,947
Hold on! This is not checkmate.

77
00:08:51,725 --> 00:08:53,055
Oh... Checkmate!

78
00:08:53,294 --> 00:08:56,420
We've got everybody we have working on the problem.

79
00:08:56,496 --> 00:08:59,657
I love X- Files too. I hope you get to see it.

80
00:09:01,634 --> 00:09:05,569
David! What's the point in having a beeper if you don't turn it on?

81
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,729
I was ignoring you.

82
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,964
What's the big emergency?

83
00:09:10,075 --> 00:09:13,942
It started this morning. Every station's making like it's the 1950s.

84
00:09:14,046 --> 00:09:18,344
We got static, snow, all kinds of distortions. Nobody knows

85
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,282
There's a reason we have bins labeled Recycle.

86
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:24,150
What the hell is going on? My God in heaven!

87
00:09:24,255 --> 00:09:27,381
So sue me. David! We got a problem!

88
00:09:27,491 --> 00:09:29,856
Did you switch transponder channels?

89
00:09:29,927 --> 00:09:33,088
Please! You think I'd be this panicked if it was so simple?

90
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,892
OK, let's point the dish at another satellite.

91
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:40,458
We tried that. It didn't work. It's almost as though they weren't there.

92
00:09:40,537 --> 00:09:43,403
All right. What have we got here?

93
00:09:48,278 --> 00:09:50,506
This is impossible.

94
00:09:53,816 --> 00:09:58,946
The signal's all screwed up. Stop it! Just leave it alone. You'll break it!

95
00:09:59,021 --> 00:10:01,351
It's so fuzzy.

96
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,686
Oh, no.

97
00:10:14,601 --> 00:10:16,163
Morning, Lucas.

98
00:10:16,236 --> 00:10:20,898
You see these? I got a whole goddamn crop full of these.

99
00:10:21,008 --> 00:10:26,912
If your father's not in the air in 20 minutes, I'm getting someone else.

100
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,581
Russell! Hey, Miguel!

101
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:53,234
Russell! What are you doing?

102
00:11:09,306 --> 00:11:12,365
Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?

103
00:11:15,411 --> 00:11:17,502
It's the wrong field, you idiot!

104
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,876
Lucas's farm's on the other side of town!

105
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:25,510
Are you sure?

106
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:07,684
CNS is running a story that we're
covering up a nuclear-testing experiment.

107
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:10,590
They can run with it if they want to embarrass themselves.

108
00:12:10,662 --> 00:12:12,753
NASA wants to know our position.

109
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:17,563
Our official position is we have no official position.

110
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:21,092
What is going on here? Guys, would I keep you out of the loop?

111
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:24,605
Absolutely. What? I can't hear you.

112
00:12:24,676 --> 00:12:27,610
At the moment our satellites are somewhat unreliable.

113
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:30,704
Isn't it possible that this thing may just pass us by?

114
00:12:30,815 --> 00:12:35,045
What if it doesn't. Why don't we target some ICBMs to blow it up?

115
00:12:35,118 --> 00:12:38,177
And risk turning one dangerous falling object into many?

116
00:12:38,255 --> 00:12:42,122
We don't yet know enough to make any kind of intelligent judgments.

117
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:45,491
Luckily the press is making up their own story for now.

118
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,861
But that's not gonna keep.

119
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,902
We may need to upgrade to DEFCON 3. Absolutely

120
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,063
General, tell NORAD we're on DEFCON 3.

121
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,700
That's not what the President said. Isn't that a bit premature?

122
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,768
Over 50% of the armed forces are on weekend leave.

123
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:05,143
Plus the commanders and troops that
are in town for the Fourth of July parade.

124
00:13:05,216 --> 00:13:08,207
The object has settled into a stationary orbit.

125
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:11,084
Well, that's good news. Not really, sir.

126
00:13:11,723 --> 00:13:15,088
Part of it has broken off into nearly three dozen pieces.

127
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:20,118
Smaller than the whole, yet over 15 miles in width themselves

128
00:13:22,864 --> 00:13:24,292
Where are they heading?

129
00:13:25,022 --> 00:13:29,981
They should be entering our atmosphere within the next 25 minutes.

130
00:13:58,343 --> 00:14:01,072
This had better be good. Admiral on deck!

131
00:14:04,116 --> 00:14:07,881
Sir, we're looking at a total radar blackout over a 13km area.

132
00:14:07,953 --> 00:14:10,682
Let's do a diagnostic check. Excuse me, sir.

133
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:15,315
The radar may be malfunctioning, but the infrared is totally off the map.

134
00:14:19,697 --> 00:14:21,493
Jeez!

135
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:25,766
Get me Atlantic Command.

136
00:14:28,672 --> 00:14:29,695
Hang on, sir.

137
00:14:29,807 --> 00:14:33,206
We have visual range with incoming over Iraqi air space.

138
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:37,676
Second sighting? Yes, sir. Just came in from the Persian Gulf.

139
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,768
Correction, sir

140
00:14:38,881 --> 00:14:41,074
We have two confirmed visual contacts.

141
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:45,517
Mr. President, they're tracking another one off the California coastline!

142
00:14:45,588 --> 00:14:49,683
All right, put it on. General, you might wanna watch this.

143
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,094
Ladies and gentlemen, we are interrupting our regular broadcast

144
00:14:56,164 --> 00:14:59,290
to bring you extraordinary events taking place in Russia.

145
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:04,326
This unexplained disturbance and the resulting hysteria are incredible.

146
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:07,100
How would you describe what you are seeing?

147
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:12,974
It is clearing the mountains, moving too slowly to be a comet or meteor.

148
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:16,640
Widespread panic has gripped the countryside as

149
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:19,341
thousands have taken to the streets.

150
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:23,912
It is confirmed. The unexplained phenomenon is headed for Moscow.

151
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,423
We have an AWAC off the West Coast.

152
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:29,823
ETA with contact point, three minutes.

153
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,821
Don't understand it, sir. Side radar doesn't see a thing.

154
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:36,456
I know! I'm blind, sir. Nothing is registering.

155
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:40,627
Negative. We have zero visibility. Visibility is at zero.

156
00:15:40,738 --> 00:15:44,194
Command, this is Eagle Eye 370.

157
00:15:44,275 --> 00:15:48,437
Captain, the President is listening. Repeat what you just told me.

158
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:52,378
We still have zero visibility.

159
00:15:53,584 --> 00:15:57,074
Instrumentation is malfunctioning.

160
00:15:57,187 --> 00:16:00,280
We can't get any kind of reading on what's in front of us.

161
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,618
Wait a minute.

162
00:16:02,692 --> 00:16:04,386
It may be clearing.

163
00:16:12,168 --> 00:16:14,226
Pull out!

164
00:16:24,445 --> 00:16:27,708
Line's gone, sir. Two more spotted over the Atlantic.

165
00:16:27,815 --> 00:16:30,305
One's moving toward New York, the other here.

166
00:16:30,417 --> 00:16:33,714
How long do we have? Less than 10 minutes.

167
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,721
Mr. President, I recommend we move you to a secure location.

168
00:16:37,824 --> 00:16:41,589
Connie, can we expect the same panic? More than likely

169
00:16:41,662 --> 00:16:44,653
We can discuss this on the way. I'm not leaving.

170
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:48,227
We have to maintain a working government.

171
00:16:48,302 --> 00:16:53,261
Take the Vice President, the whole cabinet,
and the Joint Chiefs to a secured location.

172
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:54,532
I'm staying.

173
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,632
I don't want to add to a public hysteria that's gonna cost lives.

174
00:16:58,711 --> 00:17:02,441
Connie, we'll initiate the emergency broadcast system.

175
00:17:02,514 --> 00:17:04,605
We'll advise people not to panic.

176
00:17:04,683 --> 00:17:07,844
The best idea right now is to stay in their homes.

177
00:17:07,954 --> 00:17:09,750
Yes, sir. Roy? Dean?

178
00:17:09,854 --> 00:17:14,756
Have the cabinet members rendezvous here. We'll take them to NORAD.

179
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:19,452
Mr. President, with your permission, I'd like to remain at your side.

180
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,264
I had a feeling you would.

181
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,362
What happens if they do become hostile?

182
00:17:31,962 --> 00:17:34,395
There it is. The strange atmospheric phenomenon

183
00:17:34,464 --> 00:17:37,693
It is apparently what is causing all the distortions

184
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,632
David, are you watching this?

185
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:49,202
There is no evidence that these phenomena are endangering anyone

186
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,436
Thus far, reports of oppression

187
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,139
Marty, I got a lock on that signal pattern so we can filter it out.

188
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,684
But if my calculations are right, it'll be gone in seven hours.

189
00:17:59,755 --> 00:18:05,453
It's reducing itself every time it
recycles so eventually it'll disappear.

190
00:18:05,526 --> 00:18:08,016
Are you listening? Can you believe this?

191
00:18:10,563 --> 00:18:13,292
Haven't you been watching? David!

192
00:18:15,335 --> 00:18:19,963
Good afternoon. So far the phenomenon has not caused any damage.

193
00:18:20,072 --> 00:18:24,268
We have to ask you to stay calm, and
it's important for everyone not to panic.

194
00:18:24,344 --> 00:18:27,834
We have a fix on three of the occurrences about to appear

195
00:18:27,947 --> 00:18:30,847
It's just unreal. Miguel, come here!

196
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,178
One is headed towards Los Angeles.

197
00:18:33,285 --> 00:18:39,085
The other two are headed towards New York and Washington, DC.

198
00:18:39,158 --> 00:18:40,385
Marty.

199
00:18:40,491 --> 00:18:43,391
Jamie says this building has an old bomb shelter.

200
00:18:43,494 --> 00:18:47,861
We're heading down there now. Everybody! Head down to the basement

201
00:18:47,964 --> 00:18:51,398
Take it slow, don't run. Walk down to the basement!

202
00:18:53,604 --> 00:18:55,729
There's no shame in hiding.

203
00:18:55,807 --> 00:18:58,400
I'd better call my mother.

204
00:19:09,484 --> 00:19:12,543
Well, look who we have here.

205
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:21,424
Russ, I heard you had a little trouble
this morning. Dusted the wrong field

206
00:19:21,497 --> 00:19:26,091
I know you're probably still a little
confused from your hostage experience.

207
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:30,000
Hostage experience? Did something happen to you, Russ?

208
00:19:30,939 --> 00:19:35,705
Years back he was kidnapped by aliens.
Did all kind of experiments on him and such

209
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:39,734
Tell them about it, Russ. Get a few beers
in him and he'll tell you all about it.

210
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:41,779
Won't you, Russ?

211
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:45,908
Russ, when they took you up in their spaceship, did they do any

212
00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:51,447
sexual things? Do you recall? Do you recollect?

213
00:20:20,751 --> 00:20:22,842
What's that? Let's get outta here.

214
00:20:26,055 --> 00:20:28,146
Wow!

215
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,499
Mommy, look it!

216
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,775
It's too early, baby.

217
00:21:01,655 --> 00:21:05,317
Is it an earthquake? Not even a four-pointer.

218
00:21:05,426 --> 00:21:07,985
Go back to sleep.

219
00:21:22,808 --> 00:21:24,866
Daddy!

220
00:21:27,011 --> 00:21:29,239
What are you doing here?

221
00:21:29,315 --> 00:21:32,147
You should be in the shelter. What's going on?

222
00:22:05,681 --> 00:22:08,148
Aren't you coming, David? I gotta see this.

223
00:23:35,231 --> 00:23:38,222
The signal!

224
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,391
My God!

225
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:59,078
Now what do we do?

226
00:23:59,186 --> 00:24:01,050
Address the nation.

227
00:24:01,154 --> 00:24:03,986
There's gonna be a lot of frightened people out there.

228
00:24:04,057 --> 00:24:05,648
Yeah.

229
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:07,783
I'm one of them.

230
00:24:10,464 --> 00:24:12,397
Hey! Come on!

231
00:24:12,467 --> 00:24:14,991
He's just trying to impress you.

232
00:24:15,068 --> 00:24:19,902
If you wanna impress me, you need to get
a job and stop slobbering all over my shoes.

233
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,910
I don't believe this. Jasmine!

234
00:24:38,022 --> 00:24:42,582
Neighbors are moving out. I guess they
finally got tired of all these quakes.

235
00:24:44,862 --> 00:24:46,920
A little shake and they running

236
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:50,930
Police and fire departments want everyone to stay off the phone.

237
00:24:51,034 --> 00:24:53,627
There's something on the news about the quake!

238
00:24:57,006 --> 00:25:00,201
What's up, man? What you doing going out there?

239
00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:01,673
Shooting aliens

240
00:25:01,745 --> 00:25:06,407
Oh, you shooting aliens. You think you're
tough, huh? What you got? Turn around.

241
00:25:06,482 --> 00:25:09,450
Come on, let's get you something to eat.

242
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:15,446
Watch out! Watch it now! I'm gonna go grab the paper.

243
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,117
Dylan!

244
00:25:32,273 --> 00:25:34,364
Come on, honey. Let's go!

245
00:25:49,955 --> 00:25:53,116
Babe, you want some of this coffee?

246
00:25:53,193 --> 00:25:54,682
Babe?

247
00:26:01,066 --> 00:26:04,057
Pentagon officials are warning more ships have arrived

248
00:26:04,136 --> 00:26:07,002
over the capitals of India, England and Germany,

249
00:26:07,105 --> 00:26:12,132
bringing estimates up to between 10 and 15 of these city-size spacecraft.

250
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:16,009
I know, Ma. Just try and stay calm.

251
00:26:16,112 --> 00:26:18,807
Tell her to leave town. Why? What happened?

252
00:26:18,916 --> 00:26:21,713
Just do it! Ma, listen!

253
00:26:21,786 --> 00:26:24,811
Get your stuff together and head for Aunt Esther's.

254
00:26:24,921 --> 00:26:27,718
Don't argue with me! Just go!

255
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:31,156
David! Why did I just send my mother to Atlanta?

256
00:26:31,227 --> 00:26:33,420
David, talk to me.

257
00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:37,964
The signal in the satellite feed is
recycling down to extinction. Didn't you hear me?

258
00:26:38,033 --> 00:26:39,932
Not really. Countdown

259
00:26:40,002 --> 00:26:43,231
A countdown? To what, David?

260
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,630
It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces.

261
00:26:48,743 --> 00:26:52,905
Then, when the timing's right, you strike. See?

262
00:26:53,816 --> 00:26:58,514
They're positioning themselves everywhere
using one signal to synchronize their efforts.

263
00:26:58,586 --> 00:27:03,248
In about six hours, the signal's gonna
disappear and the countdown will be over.

264
00:27:03,357 --> 00:27:05,448
And then what?

265
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,420
Checkmate.

266
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:12,825
Oh, my God!

267
00:27:12,933 --> 00:27:14,832
Oh, my God, I gotta call my brother.

268
00:27:14,935 --> 00:27:17,767
I'd better call my housekeeper, and my lawyer!

269
00:27:17,837 --> 00:27:19,736
Ah, forget my lawyer.

270
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:23,068
Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States

271
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:25,165
Good afternoon.

272
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:27,267
My fellow Americans,

273
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:30,778
a historic and unprecedented event has occurred.

274
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:33,975
The question of whether or not we're alone in the universe

275
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:36,019
has been answered.

276
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:40,488
Although it's understandable that many of us feel hesitation or fear,

277
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:43,389
we must attempt to reserve judgment.

278
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,985
He says he's your husband.

279
00:27:47,031 --> 00:27:49,089
Oh, God.

280
00:27:51,201 --> 00:27:54,101
What do you want? You gotta leave the White House.

281
00:27:54,203 --> 00:27:57,262
This is hardly the time to be having that old discussion.

282
00:27:57,373 --> 00:27:59,237
You gotta leave Washington.

283
00:27:59,309 --> 00:28:03,005
In case you haven't noticed, we are having a little crisis here!

284
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:05,842
They have a hidden signal. They're gonna attack.

285
00:28:05,915 --> 00:28:09,212
You are just being paranoid! It's not paranoia!

286
00:28:09,285 --> 00:28:12,719
The embedding's very subtle. It was probably overlooked

287
00:28:20,194 --> 00:28:23,389
Marty, get out of town as soon as you can. Please?

288
00:28:23,497 --> 00:28:27,432
The staff and I will remain here as we attempt to communicate.

289
00:28:28,936 --> 00:28:33,929
If you feel compelled to leave these
cities, please do so in an orderly fashion.

290
00:28:42,215 --> 00:28:44,273
Excuse me! Coming through

291
00:28:45,751 --> 00:28:50,449
The arrival of the aliens has caused over
10,000 fender benders in just a few seconds

292
00:28:50,556 --> 00:28:53,023
But this is just the beginning...

293
00:28:53,092 --> 00:28:58,154
You can't go! You got to call them back!
I'm not gonna do this with you, Jasmine.

294
00:28:58,263 --> 00:29:02,255
I've got to report to El Toro. You said you was on leave for the Fourth!

295
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:05,028
Well, they canceled it!

296
00:29:06,304 --> 00:29:08,429
Look, why are you acting like this?

297
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:10,165
Why?

298
00:29:13,643 --> 00:29:15,337
That's why!

299
00:29:24,488 --> 00:29:29,981
Look, I really don't think they flew 90
billion light years to come and start a fight,

300
00:29:30,861 --> 00:29:33,089
and get all rowdy.

301
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:39,295
Why don't you just relax? I'm gonna report
to El Toro, find out what's going on.

302
00:29:42,204 --> 00:29:46,400
What are you doing in there, man? Nothing, I'm just driving.

303
00:29:47,175 --> 00:29:48,607
Look.

304
00:29:48,709 --> 00:29:51,268
I got these for you. Firecrackers!

305
00:29:51,346 --> 00:29:53,404
You be careful. Steve, wait.

306
00:29:53,515 --> 00:29:56,880
I wanna tell you something. What is it, Jasmine?

307
00:30:00,387 --> 00:30:02,411
You take care of yourself, you hear?

308
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:06,782
Look,

309
00:30:08,228 --> 00:30:13,324
why don't you pack some things and you
and Dylan come stay with me on the base?

310
00:30:13,399 --> 00:30:16,492
You will see that there is nothing to be scared of.

311
00:30:17,003 --> 00:30:19,094
Really?

312
00:30:19,739 --> 00:30:23,104
You don't mind? Well, I mean...

313
00:30:23,176 --> 00:30:27,168
I will have to let all my other girlfriends know they can't come over.

314
00:30:27,245 --> 00:30:32,113
I got to postpone a freaky weekend. There you go, thinking you're all that.

315
00:30:32,183 --> 00:30:35,548
But you are not as charming as you think you are, sir.

316
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,650
Yes, I am.

317
00:30:38,355 --> 00:30:42,313
Them big old Dumbo ears. Look at you with them chicken legs.

318
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,733
Come on, Dylan.

319
00:30:57,841 --> 00:31:00,034
Look out!

320
00:31:07,883 --> 00:31:11,339
The television said they started looting. Vultures

321
00:31:12,154 --> 00:31:16,418
Do you still have the Plymouth? David, you don't have a license.

322
00:31:16,492 --> 00:31:19,051
You're driving. Yeah, I'm... I'm driving?

323
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,456
Come on.

324
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,822
I really want you out of Los Angeles.

325
00:31:24,898 --> 00:31:29,458
You're staying there to keep people calm.
I won't let them criticize you for it.

326
00:31:29,569 --> 00:31:34,437
I appreciate your trying to help me.
Liar. Stick to the truth. You're good at it.

327
00:31:34,508 --> 00:31:37,237
OK. I don't want you in any one of those cities.

328
00:31:38,778 --> 00:31:41,837
I'll leave as soon as the interviews are done.

329
00:31:41,915 --> 00:31:44,906
All right. A helicopter will be taking you to Nullius.

330
00:31:45,018 --> 00:31:47,417
And the munchkin? She'll meet you there.

331
00:31:47,987 --> 00:31:50,511
All right. I love you.

332
00:31:51,257 --> 00:31:52,484
I love you.

333
00:31:52,591 --> 00:31:55,684
Bye. Bye.

334
00:32:00,498 --> 00:32:01,987
It's the White House!

335
00:32:02,067 --> 00:32:05,523
You can't drive up and ring a bell. Can't you go any faster?

336
00:32:05,637 --> 00:32:09,470
You think they don't know what you know? She works for the President.

337
00:32:09,541 --> 00:32:12,236
They know everything. They don't know this.

338
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:15,938
You're gonna educate them, huh? So are you so smart?

339
00:32:16,046 --> 00:32:19,606
How come you spent eight years in MIT to become a cable repairman?

340
00:32:19,715 --> 00:32:22,841
All I'm saying is they got people who handle these things.

341
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:26,911
If they want HBO, they'll call you. Look at these people, look.

342
00:32:27,022 --> 00:32:29,113
Vultures. They take and then they go.

343
00:32:29,225 --> 00:32:32,454
They're going faster than we are. We're in the fast lane!

344
00:32:32,528 --> 00:32:35,360
They're cutting me off. No one's cutting you off!

345
00:32:35,464 --> 00:32:39,126
They're getting in front. I can't go faster. I don't wanna argue.

346
00:32:39,235 --> 00:32:42,067
Let's just get there, quickly. What's the rush?

347
00:32:42,137 --> 00:32:45,627
You think we'll get to Washington and it won't be there?

348
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,674
A crop-duster was arrested as he dropped leaflets from the air.

349
00:32:50,744 --> 00:32:53,905
Everybody's leaving. Can you give us some of your time?

350
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:58,176
We've got to stop them! I was kidnapped by space aliens ten years ago!

351
00:32:58,284 --> 00:33:00,375
They did all kinds of experiments on me!

352
00:33:00,486 --> 00:33:03,579
They've been studying us, finding out our weaknesses!

353
00:33:03,689 --> 00:33:06,952
We've gotta stop them. They're gonna kill us all!

354
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:11,290
Some people attribute his behavior to post-traumatic stress

355
00:33:11,363 --> 00:33:13,591
from his service as a pilot in Vietnam.

356
00:33:13,697 --> 00:33:16,187
Others have a more unusual theory.

357
00:33:16,301 --> 00:33:18,131
How would you describe Mr. Casse?

358
00:33:18,202 --> 00:33:20,829
Keeps to himself. Quiet. Private.

359
00:33:20,939 --> 00:33:23,372
When they took him up in the spaceship,

360
00:33:23,441 --> 00:33:27,637
the aliens abused him sexually.

361
00:33:28,345 --> 00:33:30,403
Mr. Casse is in the county lockup...

362
00:33:30,514 --> 00:33:32,572
Pack up. We're leaving.

363
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,774
He may be released later tonight...

364
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,011
Miguel, what about Dad?

365
00:33:40,256 --> 00:33:42,780
This could be our last night on Earth.

366
00:33:44,026 --> 00:33:46,585
You don't wanna die a virgin, do you?

367
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:49,024
Come on! We're going. No, I'm not going anywhere.

368
00:33:49,098 --> 00:33:50,792
Miguel!

369
00:33:52,962 --> 00:33:54,519
Stop it!

370
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,360
Thanks a lot, partner!

371
00:34:02,171 --> 00:34:04,195
You read my mind!

372
00:34:04,706 --> 00:34:06,536
Stay here.

373
00:34:06,608 --> 00:34:09,837
We gotta get as far away from these things as we can!

374
00:34:09,944 --> 00:34:12,343
They let you out? You damn right!

375
00:34:12,414 --> 00:34:15,439
They got bigger fish to fry now, believe you me!

376
00:34:15,551 --> 00:34:16,909
Come on, boy!

377
00:34:26,186 --> 00:34:28,882
Do you think we can find something better to do with our time?

378
00:34:29,056 --> 00:34:30,818
Where you been, Stevie?

379
00:34:30,925 --> 00:34:33,392
Man, this is unbelievable. This is, like, huge.

380
00:34:33,461 --> 00:34:38,055
They've recalled everybody. Looks like the mail's still working.

381
00:34:42,803 --> 00:34:44,793
You'll have to do the honors for me.

382
00:34:44,871 --> 00:34:47,498
You're a wuss! Whatever. Shut up and read it.

383
00:34:48,241 --> 00:34:52,801
It says: "Captain Steven Hiller"...loser.

384
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:55,675
Come on! Blah blah blah!

385
00:34:56,615 --> 00:35:01,551
We regret to inform you that despite your excellent record of service

386
00:35:04,089 --> 00:35:08,115
I'm sorry, man. You know what you need to do?

387
00:35:08,227 --> 00:35:12,322
You need to, like, kiss some serious booty to get ahead in this world.

388
00:35:12,431 --> 00:35:16,298
That's what I'm trying to tell you. See, I like the one-knee approach,

389
00:35:16,367 --> 00:35:20,462
because it puts the booty, like, right in front of the lip...

390
00:35:20,538 --> 00:35:22,903
What's this? That's nothing.

391
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,301
What is this?

392
00:35:25,108 --> 00:35:30,635
Jasmine kinda has a thing for dolphins. Stevie, this is a wedding ring.

393
00:35:35,251 --> 00:35:38,048
I thought you said you were gonna break it off?

394
00:35:39,156 --> 00:35:41,247
Well...

395
00:35:42,925 --> 00:35:45,118
Man, you know I really like Jasmine.

396
00:35:45,194 --> 00:35:47,285
You know that, right?

397
00:35:48,331 --> 00:35:53,926
Man, you're never gonna get to fly the
space shuttle if you marry a stripper.

398
00:36:00,475 --> 00:36:05,001
It could only happen in California.
Here's Wendy Walsh with a special report.

399
00:36:05,113 --> 00:36:10,413
Hundreds of UFO fanatics have gathered on rooftops in Los Angeles

400
00:36:10,517 --> 00:36:12,507
to welcome the new arrivals.

401
00:36:12,585 --> 00:36:15,075
Oh, God! I hope they bring back Elvis!

402
00:36:15,155 --> 00:36:19,215
I just came in to get my check tonight and I got talked into working.

403
00:36:19,325 --> 00:36:21,349
Oh, I must have been tripping.

404
00:36:21,427 --> 00:36:23,485
It's the party event of the century!

405
00:36:23,563 --> 00:36:26,156
Everyone is invited, especially you-know-who.

406
00:36:26,232 --> 00:36:29,098
his is so cool! Girl, please!

407
00:36:29,168 --> 00:36:31,795
Oh, hey! I made it before I came in.

408
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,368
Check it out!

409
00:36:36,441 --> 00:36:39,375
I know you're not gonna join those idiots.

410
00:36:39,443 --> 00:36:42,036
I am going over there as soon as I get off.

411
00:36:42,147 --> 00:36:44,080
Do you wanna come? Tiffany, listen to me a sec.

412
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:49,211
I've got a really bad feeling about this. I don't want you to go.

413
00:36:49,884 --> 00:36:52,317
Now promise me you won't.

414
00:36:51,488 --> 00:36:53,579
Come on, girl! Promise me.

415
00:36:55,391 --> 00:36:56,982
I promise.

416
00:36:57,694 --> 00:36:58,717
OK.

417
00:36:59,227 --> 00:37:02,184
Look, I'm out of town for a while.

418
00:37:02,864 --> 00:37:04,125
Later. Bye.

419
00:37:10,503 --> 00:37:15,201
Everyone is trying to get out of Washington.
We're the only schmucks trying to get in.

420
00:37:16,703 --> 00:37:18,670
What the hell is that?

421
00:37:18,773 --> 00:37:20,861
Pops, this is every phone book in America.

422
00:37:21,841 --> 00:37:24,472
You think an important person like Constance will be listed?

423
00:37:24,683 --> 00:37:27,515
She always keeps her portable phone listed for emergencies.

424
00:37:44,661 --> 00:37:46,287
So?

425
00:37:46,363 --> 00:37:48,659
Do you wanna ring the bell, or should I?

426
00:37:50,633 --> 00:37:54,534
Perfect, she's using it. What? It's busy?

427
00:37:54,637 --> 00:37:59,971
Yeah, I can use her signal to triangulate
her exact position in the White House.

428
00:38:00,676 --> 00:38:02,575
You can do that? Yeah.

429
00:38:02,677 --> 00:38:05,076
All cable repairmen can, Pops.

430
00:38:05,147 --> 00:38:09,082
The visitors have arrived, but the President remains at the White House.

431
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:15,678
Question. Are Mr. Whitmore's actions a) ultra brave or b) foolhardy?

432
00:38:16,891 --> 00:38:19,324
What? Don't hang up, sweetie.

433
00:38:19,393 --> 00:38:21,723
David! How did you get this number?

434
00:38:21,795 --> 00:38:26,162
Do me a favor. Walk to the window. And I'm looking for what?

435
00:38:26,266 --> 00:38:28,199
You'll see.

436
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,290
Over here

437
00:38:32,105 --> 00:38:33,594
See us?

438
00:38:33,706 --> 00:38:36,139
How does he do that?

439
00:38:44,716 --> 00:38:48,276
In light of our apparent inability to communicate with the visitors

440
00:38:48,354 --> 00:38:51,753
Pentagon officials have retrofit this Skylift helicopter

441
00:38:51,822 --> 00:38:54,289
with a visual communications device.

442
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:58,521
Mr. President. Gentlemen, be seated.

443
00:38:58,595 --> 00:39:01,358
Where are we now? We're commencing liftoff.

444
00:39:01,431 --> 00:39:04,297
and refitted with these enormous light panels

445
00:39:04,368 --> 00:39:06,927
that are attached to the hull and onto the sides.

446
00:39:07,038 --> 00:39:09,334
Echo One, Welcome Wagon is in the air.

447
00:39:09,406 --> 00:39:11,531
I repeat, Welcome Wagon is in the air.

448
00:39:11,607 --> 00:39:15,097
Roger, Welcome Wagon. Echo One, right beside you.

449
00:39:15,177 --> 00:39:19,612
This is something I would never believe that I would be! In the White House!

450
00:39:20,616 --> 00:39:23,913
If I knew I was gonna meet the President, I would have worn a tie.

451
00:39:23,985 --> 00:39:25,975
Look at me, I look like a schlemiel.

452
00:39:28,055 --> 00:39:29,453
my God! David,

453
00:39:29,525 --> 00:39:34,552
I don't know if he'll want to see you.
Then we're wasting time, we should go.

454
00:39:34,629 --> 00:39:37,926
Why wouldn't he listen? Last time I saw him, we had a fight.

455
00:39:37,999 --> 00:39:40,592
You walked in and punched him in the head.

456
00:39:40,668 --> 00:39:42,964
The President! He wasn't president then.

457
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:45,663
I punched him, he fought back. It was a fight!

458
00:39:45,773 --> 00:39:49,606
A fight that you started! David thought I was having an affair.

459
00:39:49,677 --> 00:39:51,836
With the President? Which I wasn't!

460
00:39:51,944 --> 00:39:54,343
Either go get him, or we should head back.

461
00:39:54,414 --> 00:39:57,609
All right, I'll get him. Wait here, and don't touch anything!

462
00:39:58,418 --> 00:40:00,476
You punched the President?

463
00:40:00,586 --> 00:40:01,676
God!

464
00:40:10,229 --> 00:40:13,288
Nearing point of contact, Echo One. We're closing in.

465
00:40:13,398 --> 00:40:15,957
Roger that. Begin sequence when ready.

466
00:40:17,021 --> 00:40:19,011
The three choppers are approaching

467
00:40:19,123 --> 00:40:23,024
what has been unanimously agreed to be the front of these spaceships

468
00:40:25,421 --> 00:40:27,354
You're leaving now?

469
00:40:27,455 --> 00:40:29,945
Hey, see if they've got those pens they give away.

470
00:40:30,057 --> 00:40:31,250
Dad, what?

471
00:40:31,326 --> 00:40:33,020
I don't have a choice

472
00:40:34,461 --> 00:40:37,361
I don't have time for this. Two minutes, Tom, please.

473
00:40:37,464 --> 00:40:40,159
Mr. President, Julius Levinson. David is my

474
00:40:40,267 --> 00:40:43,530
I told you he wouldn't listen. You have to tell him now.

475
00:40:43,636 --> 00:40:46,229
David, you have to tell him! David, tell him!

476
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:53,236
I know why we have satellite disruption.

477
00:40:54,782 --> 00:40:56,873
All right. Go ahead.

478
00:40:59,552 --> 00:41:04,352
Let's say that you wanted to coordinate with
spaceships on different sides of the Earth.

479
00:41:04,456 --> 00:41:06,786
They couldn't send a direct signal, right?

480
00:41:07,926 --> 00:41:12,055
You mean line of sight? Right. The curve of the Earth prevents it.

481
00:41:12,129 --> 00:41:16,530
You'd need satellites to relay that signal in order to reach each ship.

482
00:41:16,601 --> 00:41:22,936
Well, I found a signal hidden inside our own satellite system.

483
00:41:25,176 --> 00:41:28,302
Excuse me, Mr. President. They're starting.

484
00:41:31,147 --> 00:41:33,706
They're using our own satellites against us.

485
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,716
The clock is ticking.

486
00:41:43,297 --> 00:41:45,525
Bringing it in to hover. Welcome Wagon,

487
00:41:45,598 --> 00:41:48,088
Echo One. Approaching alien ship

488
00:41:49,736 --> 00:41:51,895
Initiating communication sequence

489
00:41:53,573 --> 00:41:55,938
Welcome Wagon has commenced.

490
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:07,712
General Grey, coordinate with the Atlantic
Command. Tell them to evacuate the cities.

491
00:42:07,786 --> 00:42:10,947
Get those helicopters away from the ship. Call them back!

492
00:42:11,056 --> 00:42:14,718
What the hell's going on? We're leaving. Kim! My daughter

493
00:42:17,128 --> 00:42:18,719
Something's happening.

494
00:42:22,533 --> 00:42:24,397
They're responding.

495
00:42:24,467 --> 00:42:26,263
Something is happening.

496
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:33,000
It looks like there's activity. This may be a response, Echo One.

497
00:42:33,143 --> 00:42:35,234
We see it too. Can't identify it

498
00:42:47,489 --> 00:42:50,979
We are evacuating. I repeat, we are evacuating the White House.

499
00:42:53,294 --> 00:42:56,557
Load the rest of the staff in the second helicopter.

500
00:42:57,965 --> 00:43:00,398
Is my wife in the air? She will be shortly.

501
00:43:01,003 --> 00:43:02,401
Nice. Very nice

502
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:04,835
Good! Close the door! Hatch secure!

503
00:43:05,973 --> 00:43:07,564
We have our own phone.

504
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:12,176
Move outta here.

505
00:43:14,481 --> 00:43:17,381
The President's ordered an evacuation.

506
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:20,282
Our prayers go out to the pilots' families.

507
00:43:20,386 --> 00:43:22,819
Indeed, God help us all. Mr.s Whitmore

508
00:43:22,887 --> 00:43:25,582
The visitors responded with terrifying...

509
00:43:25,658 --> 00:43:29,593
Authorities have called for the evacuation of Los Angeles County.

510
00:43:29,662 --> 00:43:33,027
People are advised to avoid the highways wherever possible.

511
00:43:33,132 --> 00:43:35,223
Great! Now he tells me.

512
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:44,302
This is the Los Angeles Police Department.

513
00:43:44,409 --> 00:43:49,141
Please vacate the premises immediately for your own safety.

514
00:44:05,161 --> 00:44:07,754
Can we move it along? Dr Katz's office

515
00:44:07,864 --> 00:44:11,093
Hello. Dr Katz, please. I'm sorry, he's not available.

516
00:44:11,234 --> 00:44:14,690
For $300 an hour, you can put me through to his house in the Hamptons!

517
00:44:23,044 --> 00:44:25,739
This is the Los Angeles Police Department.

518
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:29,904
Please vacate the premises immediately for your own safety.

519
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,676
Mrs. Whitmore!

520
00:44:34,555 --> 00:44:36,488
You must leave now.

521
00:44:42,594 --> 00:44:44,719
The First Lady's secured. We're on the move.

522
00:44:55,007 --> 00:44:57,337
They're opening up!

523
00:45:09,086 --> 00:45:10,780
It's so pretty.

524
00:45:38,513 --> 00:45:41,140
Get the hell outta here!

525
00:45:53,633 --> 00:45:56,396
Go ahead, pilot. We're ready to take off right now.

526
00:45:56,469 --> 00:45:59,028
Can we get a blanket for Patricia?

527
00:46:02,173 --> 00:46:03,833
Here.

528
00:46:18,657 --> 00:46:20,146
Time's up.

529
00:47:24,051 --> 00:47:25,847
Oh, crap.

530
00:49:02,666 --> 00:49:04,963
Oh, my God! Come on, Dylan! We gotta go!

531
00:49:05,502 --> 00:49:07,231
Come on, Boomer!

532
00:49:47,357 --> 00:49:49,291
Boomer!

533
00:50:20,802 --> 00:50:23,930
Reports are unclear as to the extent of the devastation,

534
00:50:24,007 --> 00:50:27,499
but it appears that Los Angeles, Washington, and New York are in ruins.

535
00:50:27,579 --> 00:50:29,808
Good God!

536
00:50:29,915 --> 00:50:31,473
I've been saying it.

537
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:35,281
I've been saying it for ten damn years! Aingt I, Miguel?

538
00:50:35,355 --> 00:50:37,414
Huh? I've been saying it!

539
00:50:38,158 --> 00:50:42,152
Dad, I don't feel good. Pull it over, man.

540
00:50:51,176 --> 00:50:54,577
We're gonna be all right, Troy. Yeah, leave me alone. I got it.

541
00:50:58,986 --> 00:51:00,851
Miguel!

542
00:51:00,956 --> 00:51:03,015
Look at all that.

543
00:51:25,388 --> 00:51:28,483
We could have evacuated the cities hours ago.

544
00:51:31,363 --> 00:51:33,957
That's the advantage of being a fighter pilot.

545
00:51:35,401 --> 00:51:37,801
In the Gulf War, we knew what we had to do.

546
00:51:40,241 --> 00:51:42,004
This is just...

547
00:51:42,911 --> 00:51:45,243
not simple any more

548
00:51:46,182 --> 00:51:48,241
A lot of people died today.

549
00:51:53,393 --> 00:51:55,452
How many didn't have to?

550
00:51:58,432 --> 00:52:01,458
Any news on my wife yet?

551
00:52:01,536 --> 00:52:04,471
The helicopter never made it to Nullius.

552
00:52:06,743 --> 00:52:08,835
No radio contact.

553
00:52:15,554 --> 00:52:17,646
Come on, Dylan. Stay close.

554
00:52:27,638 --> 00:52:29,435
Here it is.

555
00:52:54,106 --> 00:52:56,165
What happened, Mommy?

556
00:52:58,278 --> 00:53:00,303
I don't know, baby.

557
00:53:00,582 --> 00:53:00,614
You men will be the first wave in our counterattack.

558
00:53:00,615 --> 00:53:03,175
You men will be the first wave in our counterattack.

559
00:53:03,284 --> 00:53:05,343
Our target is to the north,

560
00:53:05,488 --> 00:53:08,787
centered above what remains of downtown Los Angeles.

561
00:53:08,892 --> 00:53:10,883
Our Black Knight Squadron...

562
00:53:10,962 --> 00:53:13,362
Are you scared, man? Nope.

563
00:53:14,933 --> 00:53:17,127
You? Nope.

564
00:53:19,606 --> 00:53:22,507
Hold me! Hey, pay attention.

565
00:53:23,578 --> 00:53:25,704
Something you wanna add, Captain Hiller?

566
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:29,443
No, sir. Just a little anxious to whup ET's ass, that's all.

567
00:53:32,022 --> 00:53:34,582
You'll get your chance.

568
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:36,854
You'll all get your chance.

569
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:39,363
Good hunting. Dismissed!

570
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:43,001
Let's kick the tires and light the fires, Big Daddy!

571
00:53:43,538 --> 00:53:45,597
Ready to go, sir!

572
00:53:46,176 --> 00:53:49,339
Let's bring it home. Bring that bad boy home, Captain!

573
00:53:49,413 --> 00:53:51,404
You loose? Yes, sir!

574
00:53:51,549 --> 00:53:56,179
Got your victory dance? Oh, I got it right here... yeah!

575
00:53:56,255 --> 00:54:00,215
Hey, don't get pre-patrol on me. We
don't light up till the fat lady sings.

576
00:54:00,294 --> 00:54:01,989
I'm all ears, brother!

577
00:54:11,676 --> 00:54:13,768
You the man!

578
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:21,081
All right, gentlemen, we're on. General, it's NORAD.

579
00:54:22,923 --> 00:54:25,186
General Grey here. Al?

580
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:28,593
All communications with the cities are down.

581
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:33,034
All systems gone. For intelligence, we believe it's a total loss.

582
00:54:33,104 --> 00:54:35,470
How about our boys? Where are they?

583
00:54:35,608 --> 00:54:38,703
ETA to target, four minutes

584
00:54:46,221 --> 00:54:49,554
I shouldn't have left her. Don't worry about it, big man.

585
00:54:49,659 --> 00:54:52,754
I'm sure she got outta here before it happened.

586
00:54:52,863 --> 00:54:56,094
Or, as the good Reverend would say

587
00:54:56,167 --> 00:55:00,433
Why we're on this particular mission, we'll never know.

588
00:55:00,507 --> 00:55:03,476
But I do know, here today,

589
00:55:03,578 --> 00:55:07,640
that the Black Knights will emerge victorious once again.

590
00:55:07,716 --> 00:55:10,116
Amen, man! Amen, Reverend.

591
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:25,872
Holy God!

592
00:55:29,713 --> 00:55:31,305
Lock and load!

593
00:55:33,984 --> 00:55:35,008
Roger that.

594
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:38,088
LA attack squadron has AMr.aam missiles locked on target.

595
00:55:38,157 --> 00:55:40,921
Washington and New York squadrons report lock-on.

596
00:55:40,994 --> 00:55:44,191
Fire at will. Fire at will.

597
00:55:45,834 --> 00:55:49,235
Knights, we are red and free. Knight One, fox three!

598
00:55:49,906 --> 00:55:52,169
Knight Three, fox three!

599
00:55:52,242 --> 00:55:53,640
Knight Seven, fox three.

600
00:55:55,914 --> 00:55:58,644
The missiles have been fired.

601
00:56:18,076 --> 00:56:20,408
Are they not getting through? No, not one

602
00:56:20,481 --> 00:56:24,008
Command, Knight One. Switching to Sidewinders, moving in

603
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:30,785
Knight Three, low 50 knots reference 120

604
00:56:32,629 --> 00:56:34,152
Knight Seven, 120

605
00:56:34,231 --> 00:56:36,791
Knight One, sweep lock. Fox two.

606
00:56:36,869 --> 00:56:37,858
Knight Seven...

607
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:43,901
Come on!

608
00:56:49,886 --> 00:56:53,413
They must have a protective shield over the hull! Knights, pull up!

609
00:56:58,997 --> 00:57:02,125
Knight Three, pull up! Complete failure in the stators!

610
00:57:02,235 --> 00:57:03,998
Pull up!

611
00:57:12,682 --> 00:57:14,650
Blow through!

612
00:57:14,752 --> 00:57:17,152
Too many of them!

613
00:57:19,558 --> 00:57:21,958
They got another one, sir.

614
00:57:23,931 --> 00:57:26,957
Oh no, you did not shoot that green shit at me!

615
00:57:29,905 --> 00:57:31,964
I got you covered, Big Daddy!

616
00:57:35,346 --> 00:57:37,712
Damn, they got shields, too!

617
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:51,197
Let's go, Knights! Move, Knights! Move!

618
00:57:55,573 --> 00:57:56,869
Jesus!

619
00:57:56,941 --> 00:58:00,502
They got another one. And two more. They're dropping like flies.

620
00:58:00,579 --> 00:58:03,514
We're losing it. Get them outta there.

621
00:58:03,583 --> 00:58:08,385
Squadron leaders, retreat to fallback position. Abort mission right away!

622
00:58:12,295 --> 00:58:15,355
We'll have to make a run for this one! Let's get low and fast!

623
00:58:15,431 --> 00:58:17,523
I gotcha, Big Daddy! Let's get them!

624
00:58:20,306 --> 00:58:22,432
Watch the deck!

625
00:58:29,317 --> 00:58:33,414
Squadron leader, abort! This isn't happening fast enough!

626
00:58:33,523 --> 00:58:34,614
Get them out!

627
00:58:41,366 --> 00:58:44,927
The monitor! Where's the picture? We've lost the satellite.

628
00:58:49,545 --> 00:58:52,013
We got two on our six, Jimmy. Shackle! Roger.

629
00:58:54,151 --> 00:58:55,982
Come on, come on! Move!

630
00:58:57,288 --> 00:59:01,884
You told me, like, quite all right!
They aingt got nothing for us! Let's push it!

631
00:59:01,994 --> 00:59:06,260
I can't shake them. Yes, you can. Just the way I showed you.

632
00:59:06,366 --> 00:59:08,960
I'm gonna try something. Nothing stupid!

633
00:59:09,037 --> 00:59:11,699
You know me! That's what I mean.

634
00:59:11,807 --> 00:59:13,967
Jimmy, you can't bank at that speed!

635
00:59:15,079 --> 00:59:18,276
Jimmy, he's closing on you!

636
00:59:19,718 --> 00:59:23,017
Put your mask back on! That's an order! I can't breathe!

637
00:59:24,257 --> 00:59:26,054
Jimmy!

638
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:32,065
No!

639
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:34,192
Affirmative. We have incoming.

640
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:36,738
Let me have it, son. You got it.

641
00:59:36,841 --> 00:59:39,070
Friendly?

642
00:59:39,144 --> 00:59:41,669
Sergeant? I don't think so.

643
01:00:09,785 --> 01:00:12,048
Come on and get me!

644
01:00:16,326 --> 01:00:18,726
What are you shooting at?

645
01:00:18,796 --> 01:00:20,990
Where you at, baby?! Come on!

646
01:00:26,306 --> 01:00:29,366
You can't hit nothing!

647
01:00:46,233 --> 01:00:48,325
Low bridge!

648
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:54,302
See if you can fly that thing under cover!

649
01:00:58,449 --> 01:01:01,316
Hope you got an airbag!

650
01:01:37,168 --> 01:01:39,227
Son of a bitch!

651
01:01:43,176 --> 01:01:45,007
This way! This way!

652
01:01:45,111 --> 01:01:46,976
Get off! Get off of me!

653
01:01:47,047 --> 01:01:50,574
That's what you'll get! Look at you!

654
01:01:50,652 --> 01:01:53,815
Ship all banged up! Who's the man?!

655
01:01:53,888 --> 01:01:56,857
Huh? Who's the man? Wait till I get another plane!

656
01:01:56,926 --> 01:01:59,520
I'm lining all your friends up, right beside you!

657
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:03,827
Where you at? Huh? Where you at?

658
01:02:15,718 --> 01:02:17,810
Welcome to Earth.

659
01:02:35,514 --> 01:02:38,574
Baby, stay right here with Boomer.

660
01:02:47,197 --> 01:02:50,325
Keys. Come on, keys.

661
01:02:50,402 --> 01:02:51,663
Yes!

662
01:02:51,736 --> 01:02:54,671
Come, baby. Come on!

663
01:02:58,098 --> 01:03:00,726
Reports indicate that this battle has repeated itself all over the world

664
01:03:00,801 --> 01:03:02,428
with the same results.

665
01:03:03,295 --> 01:03:05,227
See, Troy? You're feeling better already.

666
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:09,102
Everybody's packed up. They're leaving.

667
01:03:09,571 --> 01:03:15,000
They said a spaceship is headed this way.
We'd better leave, too. Don't you think?

668
01:03:22,885 --> 01:03:27,219
It's Air Force One, for crying out loud. Still he gets sick.

669
01:03:27,290 --> 01:03:30,123
I don't feel too good. Look at me, huh? Like a rock.

670
01:03:30,227 --> 01:03:32,923
Could be bad weather or good weather

671
01:03:33,065 --> 01:03:38,060
We could go up or down, back or forwards, side to side...

672
01:03:40,842 --> 01:03:43,504
What did I say?

673
01:03:44,647 --> 01:03:47,275
He still gets airsick, huh? Yeah.

674
01:03:48,151 --> 01:03:50,676
Julius, with all of this...

675
01:03:50,755 --> 01:03:54,156
I didn't get a chance to thank you two.

676
01:03:54,259 --> 01:03:56,556
All he could think of was getting to you.

677
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:04,400
There's still love there, I think.

678
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:09,275
Love was never a problem. All you need is love.

679
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:13,544
John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.

680
01:04:14,787 --> 01:04:18,849
We've moved as many of our forces away from our bases as possible.

681
01:04:18,992 --> 01:04:23,588
But we've already sustained heavy losses.
I spoke with the Joint Chiefs at NORAD.

682
01:04:23,665 --> 01:04:27,260
They agree we must counterattack with a full nuclear strike.

683
01:04:27,337 --> 01:04:28,860
Over American soil?

684
01:04:29,005 --> 01:04:33,408
You're saying we should sacrifice more innocent American civilians?

685
01:04:33,478 --> 01:04:36,743
If we don't strike soon, there may not be much of an America left!

686
01:04:36,849 --> 01:04:38,874
Sir! They've taken out NORAD.

687
01:04:39,019 --> 01:04:41,282
What? It's gone, sir.

688
01:04:41,356 --> 01:04:43,119
My God!

689
01:04:43,225 --> 01:04:45,522
The Vice President? The Joint Chiefs?

690
01:04:45,628 --> 01:04:47,687
Mr. President.

691
01:04:48,932 --> 01:04:50,262
We must launch.

692
01:04:50,334 --> 01:04:54,362
A delay would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities.

693
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:59,035
You're not gonna launch nuclear weapons.
You'll kill them and us. If we fire nukes

694
01:04:59,112 --> 01:05:03,243
Sir, may I remind you are a guest here? You ever hear of nuclear winter?

695
01:05:03,318 --> 01:05:06,719
It's the end of life as we know it. Just go.

696
01:05:06,789 --> 01:05:08,848
I don't have to go. It can't be allowed!

697
01:05:08,926 --> 01:05:12,920
Shut up! Captain, get him out! Don't tell him to shut up!

698
01:05:13,565 --> 01:05:18,970
You'd all be dead if it wasn't for my David!
None of you did anything to prevent this!

699
01:05:19,072 --> 01:05:22,769
There was nothing we could do. We were totally unprepared for this.

700
01:05:23,478 --> 01:05:25,173
Don't give me that! Come on.

701
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:28,340
It was, what? In the 1950s, you had that spaceship.

702
01:05:29,118 --> 01:05:32,679
Dad. Look...Yeah, that thing you found in New Mexico!

703
01:05:33,091 --> 01:05:34,956
Where was that? Not the spaceship.

704
01:05:35,094 --> 01:05:38,928
Roswell, New Mexico. You had the spaceship and the bodies!

705
01:05:38,999 --> 01:05:40,899
They were locked up in a bunker.

706
01:05:40,969 --> 01:05:41,993
Where was that?

707
01:05:42,136 --> 01:05:44,104
David! Area 51. Right?

708
01:05:44,173 --> 01:05:47,574
Area 51. You knew then! And you did nothing.

709
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:51,012
Sir.

710
01:05:51,148 --> 01:05:53,981
Regardless of what you may have read in the tabloids,

711
01:05:54,119 --> 01:05:57,953
there have never been any spacecraft recovered by our government.

712
01:05:58,024 --> 01:06:00,584
Take my word for it. There's no Area 51.

713
01:06:00,661 --> 01:06:02,787
And there's no recovered spaceship.

714
01:06:02,864 --> 01:06:05,992
Excuse me, Mr. President...

715
01:06:06,435 --> 01:06:10,030
That's not entirely accurate.

716
01:06:15,033 --> 01:06:17,433
What? Which part?

717
01:06:22,625 --> 01:06:24,991
Hold on, everybody. Hold on!

718
01:06:26,128 --> 01:06:27,095
Sorry.

719
01:06:48,655 --> 01:06:50,680
Can you give me a hand? Sure.

720
01:06:58,435 --> 01:06:59,662
Oh, God.

721
01:07:06,612 --> 01:07:08,875
OK, let's get this off.

722
01:07:08,948 --> 01:07:11,007
Here, let me help you.

723
01:07:14,089 --> 01:07:16,080
She's hurt pretty badly.

724
01:07:20,235 --> 01:07:23,136
You know, this was supposed to be my weekend off.

725
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:26,902
But, nooo!

726
01:07:26,978 --> 01:07:31,882
You got me out here, dragging your heavy ass through the burning desert

727
01:07:31,951 --> 01:07:35,046
with your dreadlocks sticking out the back of my parachute.

728
01:07:35,121 --> 01:07:39,649
You gotta come down here with an attitude, acting all big and bad.

729
01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:44,927
And what the hell is that smell?

730
01:07:48,707 --> 01:07:52,074
I could been at a barbecue!

731
01:07:52,143 --> 01:07:56,546
But I aingt mad. It's all right, it's all right.

732
01:08:36,203 --> 01:08:38,637
Do you need a lift, soldier?

733
01:08:38,739 --> 01:08:41,970
When I flew overhead, I saw a base not too far from here.

734
01:08:44,147 --> 01:08:46,239
It aingt on the map

735
01:08:46,383 --> 01:08:48,475
Trust me, it's there.

736
01:09:04,007 --> 01:09:05,838
Attention!

737
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:11,371
Mr. President. General

738
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:14,476
Welcome to Area 51. Please follow me.

739
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:18,516
We're now 24 floors beneath the surface

740
01:09:18,626 --> 01:09:21,493
and here's our main research facility.

741
01:09:21,864 --> 01:09:26,392
Let's see it. Sorry, sir, it's a clean room. It's static free

742
01:09:26,470 --> 01:09:28,461
Open the door.

743
01:09:30,308 --> 01:09:32,434
Yes, sir.

744
01:09:53,171 --> 01:09:54,330
My God.

745
01:09:54,473 --> 01:09:56,667
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?

746
01:09:56,743 --> 01:10:00,907
Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability

747
01:10:08,092 --> 01:10:10,321
I don't get it. Where does all this come from?

748
01:10:10,462 --> 01:10:12,987
How do you get funding for something like this?

749
01:10:13,098 --> 01:10:15,999
You don't actually think they spend $20,000 on a hammer,

750
01:10:16,102 --> 01:10:19,003
$30,000 on a toilet seat, do you?

751
01:10:20,508 --> 01:10:22,737
Mr. President, this is Dr Okun.

752
01:10:22,812 --> 01:10:28,479
He has headed up the research department
on this project for the last 15 years.

753
01:10:28,552 --> 01:10:30,144
How do you do?

754
01:10:31,355 --> 01:10:33,220
Mr. President!

755
01:10:33,324 --> 01:10:35,292
Wow!

756
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:36,519
This...

757
01:10:36,595 --> 01:10:38,995
What a pleasure!

758
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:41,397
As you can imagine, they...

759
01:10:41,536 --> 01:10:44,528
They don't let us out much.

760
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:46,939
I can understand that.

761
01:10:48,345 --> 01:10:50,108
Well!

762
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:53,547
I guess you'd like to see the big tamale, huh?

763
01:10:53,618 --> 01:10:55,710
Follow me.

764
01:11:45,588 --> 01:11:47,920
She's a beaut, aingt she?

765
01:11:50,194 --> 01:11:55,132
As you can see from the repairs, we've been
trying to put her back together since the '60s.

766
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:58,658
You've had this for 40 years and you know nothing about them?

767
01:11:58,738 --> 01:12:02,299
Oh, hell, no. We know tons about them.

768
01:12:03,245 --> 01:12:05,145
But the neatest stuff...

769
01:12:05,247 --> 01:12:08,307
The neatest stuff has only happened in the last few days.

770
01:12:08,418 --> 01:12:13,048
We can't duplicate their type of power
so we've never been able to experiment.

771
01:12:13,123 --> 01:12:19,222
But since these guys started showing up,
all the little gizmos inside turned on.

772
01:12:19,298 --> 01:12:21,892
The last 24 hours have been really exciting!

773
01:12:21,969 --> 01:12:24,938
Exciting? People are dying out there.

774
01:12:25,039 --> 01:12:28,942
Exciting isn't the word I'd choose to describe it!

775
01:12:29,446 --> 01:12:31,505
You're hoping to fly this thing, huh?

776
01:12:31,648 --> 01:12:36,677
You said you can repair their technology.
Can you tell us anything useful about them?

777
01:12:36,755 --> 01:12:41,385
Yeah. Well, I mean...They're not all that dissimilar from us.

778
01:12:41,495 --> 01:12:44,953
Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold

779
01:12:45,066 --> 01:12:48,502
Probably why they're interested in our planet

780
01:12:48,971 --> 01:12:50,494
Hey...

781
01:12:54,012 --> 01:12:56,480
You guys wanna see them?

782
01:13:05,326 --> 01:13:06,849
This is...

783
01:13:06,961 --> 01:13:09,020
This is the vault.

784
01:13:09,464 --> 01:13:12,729
Or, as some of us have come to call it...

785
01:13:12,802 --> 01:13:14,793
...the freak show.

786
01:13:37,201 --> 01:13:39,066
When we found them,

787
01:13:39,170 --> 01:13:43,164
they were wearing some sort of biomechanical suits.

788
01:13:43,242 --> 01:13:47,008
Once we got them off, we learned a great deal about their anatomy.

789
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:50,049
Eyes, ears. No vocal chords.

790
01:13:50,118 --> 01:13:54,021
We assume they communicate with each other by some other means.

791
01:13:54,089 --> 01:13:58,287
You're obviously not thinking about hand signals and body language.

792
01:13:58,396 --> 01:14:02,265
It's some kind of extrasensory perception. Telepathy

793
01:14:03,202 --> 01:14:04,931
So...

794
01:14:06,273 --> 01:14:08,332
It's an organic life form.

795
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:15,507
Can they be killed? Their bodies are just as frail as ours.

796
01:14:15,619 --> 01:14:18,087
These two died in the crash.

797
01:14:18,155 --> 01:14:20,089
This one a few weeks later

798
01:14:20,158 --> 01:14:24,220
You just have to get through their technology, which is,

799
01:14:24,296 --> 01:14:27,288
I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.

800
01:14:28,869 --> 01:14:29,699
David,

801
01:14:29,871 --> 01:14:32,100
you unlocked part of their technology.

802
01:14:32,175 --> 01:14:36,875
You cracked the code. No, no. All I did was stumble on their

803
01:14:36,947 --> 01:14:40,110
signal. I don't know how helpful I can be.

804
01:14:40,585 --> 01:14:44,522
Why don't you show him what you've discovered so far?

805
01:14:44,591 --> 01:14:47,253
Figure out what they haven't thought of yet.

806
01:14:47,894 --> 01:14:52,594
We'll see if you're as smart as we all hope you are.

807
01:15:02,315 --> 01:15:03,942
What code?

808
01:15:24,209 --> 01:15:26,905
Captain Steven Hiller, US Marine Corps.

809
01:15:26,981 --> 01:15:29,973
I'm sorry, Captain. You don't have clearance.

810
01:15:31,219 --> 01:15:33,050
OK. Come here.

811
01:15:33,956 --> 01:15:36,219
You wanna see my clearance?

812
01:15:38,796 --> 01:15:41,661
Maybe I'll just leave this here with you. Let them pass.

813
01:15:42,497 --> 01:15:45,261
Get the hell out of the way!

814
01:15:46,268 --> 01:15:47,598
Did you see that?

815
01:15:50,588 --> 01:15:51,911
Oh, boy!

816
01:15:55,919 --> 01:15:57,756
How long has he been unconscious? About three hours.

817
01:15:57,857 --> 01:15:59,860
Let's get him in containment.

818
01:16:00,524 --> 01:16:03,049
As the former head of the CIA, you knew about this place.

819
01:16:03,197 --> 01:16:05,289
When were you planning to inform us? It had been deemed classified.

820
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:09,695
You should have told us about this when they first arrived!

821
01:16:09,971 --> 01:16:16,837
We wouldn't have launched a counterattack
that cost the lives of hundreds of our pilots!

822
01:16:17,012 --> 01:16:19,948
We could not have known that our fighters would've been that ineffective!

823
01:16:20,149 --> 01:16:21,617
Mr. President.

824
01:16:21,719 --> 01:16:24,521
The little bit of information we have comes directly into this room.

825
01:16:25,391 --> 01:16:28,576
Atlanta, Chicago, and Philadelphia

826
01:16:29,379 --> 01:16:30,478
Destroyed

827
01:16:30,631 --> 01:16:35,466
NATO and Western Allied installations were the first to be taken out.

828
01:16:35,637 --> 01:16:37,069
Then we were hit.

829
01:16:37,073 --> 01:16:40,270
They knew exactly where and how to hit us.

830
01:16:40,345 --> 01:16:43,314
And our forces? We're down to 15%.

831
01:16:43,382 --> 01:16:47,716
If you calculate the time it takes to destroy a city and move on,

832
01:16:47,787 --> 01:16:52,953
we're looking at the worldwide destruction of every major city

833
01:16:53,061 --> 01:16:56,121
in the next 36 hours.

834
01:16:57,166 --> 01:16:59,896
We're being exterminated.

835
01:17:03,174 --> 01:17:04,801
Mr. President!

836
01:17:05,478 --> 01:17:07,309
This is Captain Steven Hiller.

837
01:17:07,381 --> 01:17:08,813
Captain. Mr. President.

838
01:17:08,915 --> 01:17:10,746
Well done.

839
01:17:10,817 --> 01:17:15,083
Where is it now? It's isolated in the containment lab, sir.

840
01:17:15,157 --> 01:17:17,751
I'd like to go see it.

841
01:17:22,199 --> 01:17:25,635
General, I'm really anxious to get back to El Toro.

842
01:17:28,407 --> 01:17:31,035
Hasn't anyone told you?

843
01:17:33,414 --> 01:17:36,542
El Toro has been completely destroyed.

844
01:18:28,816 --> 01:18:31,113
We were lucky.

845
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:33,745
Today was the first time I used the subway.

846
01:18:33,857 --> 01:18:36,553
Thank God for the Metro Rail.

847
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:38,719
These should last us a while.

848
01:18:38,829 --> 01:18:42,128
Don't move. I'll get it for you. Stay still.

849
01:18:43,035 --> 01:18:46,471
He's your son? He's my angel.

850
01:18:47,107 --> 01:18:50,042
Was his father stationed here?

851
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:52,170
Nah, he...

852
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:54,680
He wasn't his father.

853
01:18:55,519 --> 01:18:58,784
But I was kinda hoping he wanted the job, though.

854
01:19:02,728 --> 01:19:05,856
So what do you do for a living? I'm a dancer.

855
01:19:07,201 --> 01:19:11,604
Ballet. No. Exotic

856
01:19:15,613 --> 01:19:18,708
Sorry. Don't be. I'm not.

857
01:19:19,384 --> 01:19:23,287
It's good money. Besides my baby's worth it

858
01:19:23,356 --> 01:19:25,585
Dylan! Come here.

859
01:19:25,692 --> 01:19:28,787
I want you to meet the First Lady.

860
01:19:31,367 --> 01:19:34,495
Hello. Hi.

861
01:19:34,570 --> 01:19:36,970
I didn't know that you'd recognized me.

862
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:41,171
Well, I didn't want to say nothing. I voted for the other guy.

863
01:19:43,982 --> 01:19:48,578
Life-support monitors recording. So if we screw up, it's all on tape.

864
01:19:48,656 --> 01:19:51,784
Come on. Let's get this biomechanical suit off.

865
01:19:51,861 --> 01:19:54,523
Put the spreader right here, along the ridge.

866
01:19:54,597 --> 01:19:59,000
Microprobe thingamajig goes right here. Pick there. Good.

867
01:19:59,070 --> 01:20:01,937
All right, now spread it very, very gently.

868
01:20:02,007 --> 01:20:03,975
Let me get in.

869
01:20:10,385 --> 01:20:13,047
Gentle, gentle, that's it.

870
01:20:13,155 --> 01:20:15,214
Run this right in...

871
01:20:21,566 --> 01:20:22,793
All right

872
01:20:23,636 --> 01:20:25,194
Let's proceed.

873
01:20:25,271 --> 01:20:28,206
Now comes the really icky part.

874
01:20:30,311 --> 01:20:32,302
Oh, boy.

875
01:20:32,414 --> 01:20:35,975
This is one smelly, disgusting...

876
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:46,295
Look at it.

877
01:20:46,399 --> 01:20:49,061
It doesn't look alive, does it?

878
01:20:52,808 --> 01:20:55,402
The arm is moving.

879
01:21:04,223 --> 01:21:06,020
Doctor? Doctor?

880
01:21:09,063 --> 01:21:10,052
Doctor?

881
01:21:12,934 --> 01:21:14,629
Don't move!

882
01:21:59,830 --> 01:22:01,388
Dr Okun?

883
01:22:23,728 --> 01:22:27,164
Release me.

884
01:22:27,234 --> 01:22:29,531
Open the door. Get him out! No, wait.

885
01:22:44,389 --> 01:22:46,652
Release me.

886
01:22:59,377 --> 01:23:02,039
I know there is much we can learn from each other

887
01:23:02,113 --> 01:23:04,604
If we can negotiate a truce

888
01:23:05,450 --> 01:23:07,816
We can find a way to coexist.

889
01:23:09,657 --> 01:23:11,783
Can there be a peace between us?

890
01:23:12,993 --> 01:23:15,187
Peace.

891
01:23:16,432 --> 01:23:18,661
No peace.

892
01:23:25,010 --> 01:23:27,444
What is it you want us to do?

893
01:23:29,115 --> 01:23:31,015
Die.

894
01:23:40,229 --> 01:23:41,958
Die!

895
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:48,699
Mr. President.

896
01:23:49,710 --> 01:23:52,144
Is that glass bulletproof? No, sir

897
01:24:12,373 --> 01:24:15,865
Are you all right? I saw his thoughts.

898
01:24:16,746 --> 01:24:20,011
I saw what they're planning to do.

899
01:24:21,183 --> 01:24:23,583
They're like locusts.

900
01:24:23,688 --> 01:24:25,747
They're moving from planet to planet.

901
01:24:25,891 --> 01:24:28,017
Their whole civilization

902
01:24:28,127 --> 01:24:31,790
After they've consumed every natural resource, they move on.

903
01:24:34,035 --> 01:24:36,629
And we're next.

904
01:24:47,152 --> 01:24:49,211
Nuke them.

905
01:24:50,057 --> 01:24:52,651
Let's nuke the bastards.

906
01:25:03,774 --> 01:25:06,334
Just my luck. No ice.

907
01:25:06,478 --> 01:25:08,810
I take it you've heard?

908
01:25:09,549 --> 01:25:11,176
Hey, toast.

909
01:25:12,486 --> 01:25:16,617
To the end of the world. He didn't come to this decision lightly.

910
01:25:16,691 --> 01:25:19,387
He didn't have any other choice.

911
01:25:19,462 --> 01:25:23,365
Well, you still believe in him. Well, he's a good man.

912
01:25:25,103 --> 01:25:27,663
He'd better be. You left me for him.

913
01:25:27,773 --> 01:25:30,765
Or, you know... for your career.

914
01:25:30,844 --> 01:25:33,438
You know, it wasn't just my career.

915
01:25:33,514 --> 01:25:36,039
It was the biggest opportunity of my life.

916
01:25:36,118 --> 01:25:40,316
I wanted my life to make a difference. I wanted my life to mean something.

917
01:25:40,423 --> 01:25:45,828
And... I wasn't...ambitious enough for you?

918
01:25:45,897 --> 01:25:50,095
David, you could have done anything you wanted. Research, development

919
01:25:50,202 --> 01:25:51,829
I was happy where I was.

920
01:25:51,905 --> 01:25:56,036
Haven't you ever wanted to be part of something special?

921
01:25:58,514 --> 01:26:00,674
I was part of something special.

922
01:26:15,937 --> 01:26:20,237
Well, if it makes any difference, I never stopped loving you.

923
01:26:21,544 --> 01:26:23,636
But that wasn't enough, was it?

924
01:26:42,171 --> 01:26:45,072
Let's pick it up, man. Let's go!

925
01:26:51,684 --> 01:26:55,781
Let's pick it up, man! We're on a tight schedule! Pick it up, man!

926
01:26:55,890 --> 01:26:58,153
Pick it up!

927
01:27:01,331 --> 01:27:04,129
What the hell are you doing? Get outta there!

928
01:27:04,201 --> 01:27:06,829
I got something I gotta handle. I'm borrowing it.

929
01:27:06,937 --> 01:27:10,771
No, you're not, sir. Do you really wanna shoot me?

930
01:27:13,179 --> 01:27:15,841
Just tell them I hit you.

931
01:27:20,956 --> 01:27:22,583
Command, this is Retal Op.

932
01:27:22,659 --> 01:27:26,653
Squadron is in the air. We are on station and awaiting instructions.

933
01:27:26,764 --> 01:27:29,358
Break formation. Head to targets

934
01:27:33,574 --> 01:27:35,040
Sir

935
01:27:35,175 --> 01:27:37,006
They're breaking formation.

936
01:27:37,144 --> 01:27:41,410
We're initiating sequence code. Verification: Alpha Zulu six eight nine

937
01:27:41,484 --> 01:27:43,281
Which city will be reached first?

938
01:27:43,386 --> 01:27:46,822
Houston, Texas. ETA, six minutes and counting down

939
01:27:46,891 --> 01:27:49,826
Houston. The major cities have been deserted.

940
01:27:49,895 --> 01:27:54,595
Civilian casualties should be down to a minimum.

941
01:27:57,505 --> 01:28:01,032
Command, this is Neighborhood Watch. We are in position.

942
01:28:01,643 --> 01:28:03,702
Tracking monitors are locked on.

943
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:07,602
We are going to visual recon.

944
01:28:07,675 --> 01:28:09,370
Roger.

945
01:28:12,448 --> 01:28:15,778
We have confirmation. Launch code confirmed.

946
01:28:15,752 --> 01:28:19,585
Alpha Zulu six eight nine, standing by

947
01:28:21,626 --> 01:28:24,026
Laser targeting

948
01:28:24,097 --> 01:28:25,586
Locked on.

949
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:29,033
We're locked on, sir. Do you wish to deploy?

950
01:28:33,109 --> 01:28:36,078
Mr. President, if you wish to deploy, the time is now.

951
01:28:43,055 --> 01:28:45,023
Mr. President? Deploy.

952
01:28:45,090 --> 01:28:47,923
That's a go. Alpha Zulu six eight nine

953
01:28:48,429 --> 01:28:50,488
Here we go.

954
01:28:57,741 --> 01:28:59,299
Bird's away.

955
01:28:59,377 --> 01:29:02,642
We have visual confirmation of the missile. It's on target.

956
01:29:03,315 --> 01:29:04,907
Approaching

957
01:29:05,552 --> 01:29:07,543
May our children forgive us

958
01:29:07,688 --> 01:29:10,919
Five seconds to impact. Three, two,

959
01:29:10,992 --> 01:29:12,117
one

960
01:29:14,263 --> 01:29:16,094
It's a hit!

961
01:29:20,872 --> 01:29:23,066
Get down! Get down!

962
01:29:23,575 --> 01:29:25,907
Can we confirm that the target was destroyed?

963
01:29:25,978 --> 01:29:29,709
Get the tank commander. Confirm the target was destroyed.

964
01:29:29,783 --> 01:29:33,378
Red Arrow, Alpha 9723. Can you read?

965
01:29:33,489 --> 01:29:36,549
Repeat. You're breaking up. We have lost visual.

966
01:29:36,693 --> 01:29:39,161
Roger that. We're looking for confirmation.

967
01:29:46,238 --> 01:29:47,830
We got the bastards.

968
01:29:47,942 --> 01:29:50,934
Good job, everyone! Congratulations.

969
01:29:52,379 --> 01:29:56,407
Commander, do you have visual? We need visual confirmation.

970
01:29:56,519 --> 01:29:58,180
Has the target been destroyed?

971
01:30:12,574 --> 01:30:13,598
Negative.

972
01:30:16,646 --> 01:30:18,840
Target remains.

973
01:30:21,186 --> 01:30:24,485
I repeat, target remains

974
01:30:28,661 --> 01:30:30,890
Call the other planes back.

975
01:30:30,998 --> 01:30:34,093
The others might have more luck. We shouldn't give up!

976
01:30:34,203 --> 01:30:37,570
I said call them back!

977
01:30:38,809 --> 01:30:41,403
Abort. Abort mission.

978
01:30:41,479 --> 01:30:46,884
Issue the abort codes right away. This
is an abort, full abort. Do you read?

979
01:31:24,136 --> 01:31:26,195
Jasmine!

980
01:31:38,188 --> 01:31:39,951
You're late!

981
01:31:40,024 --> 01:31:42,754
You know I like to make an entrance.

982
01:31:52,235 --> 01:31:54,895
Where are we going? Through there, sir

983
01:31:55,036 --> 01:31:58,435
Mr. President. Your wife is resting comfortably for the moment.

984
01:31:58,507 --> 01:32:03,135
Perhaps if we had gotten to her earlier...Hey, there she is! Go on!

985
01:32:05,346 --> 01:32:09,338
She doesn't look too good. Your wife is bleeding internally.

986
01:32:09,449 --> 01:32:13,076
Perhaps if we'd gotten to her earlier...What are you saying?

987
01:32:13,552 --> 01:32:15,643
We can't stop the bleeding.

988
01:32:16,288 --> 01:32:18,412
If we'd...

989
01:32:18,489 --> 01:32:21,422
There's nothing we can do for her.

990
01:32:21,491 --> 01:32:25,152
We were worried. We didn't know where you were.

991
01:32:30,534 --> 01:32:34,093
You've gotten bigger, I think. I did?

992
01:32:36,872 --> 01:32:39,361
You just keep growing and growing.

993
01:32:41,441 --> 01:32:42,906
I can't...

994
01:32:44,645 --> 01:32:46,133
Hey.

995
01:32:46,247 --> 01:32:50,681
Can you wait outside for a little bit so Mom can get a rest?

996
01:32:50,750 --> 01:32:52,307
Come on, Munchkin.

997
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:05,655
I'm so sorry that I didn't come home when you asked me to.

998
01:33:08,567 --> 01:33:09,759
It's OK.

999
01:33:12,335 --> 01:33:13,892
The doctors...

1000
01:33:15,138 --> 01:33:19,300
think that you're... gonna be just fine.

1001
01:33:21,877 --> 01:33:23,776
Liar.

1002
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:21,984
Is Mommy sleeping now?

1003
01:34:23,997 --> 01:34:25,462
Yeah.

1004
01:34:26,865 --> 01:34:28,956
Mommy's sleeping.

1005
01:35:04,831 --> 01:35:05,854
David!

1006
01:35:06,432 --> 01:35:09,490
What the hell are you doing? I'm making a mess!

1007
01:35:09,603 --> 01:35:11,263
Yeah. This I can see.

1008
01:35:11,370 --> 01:35:16,396
We gotta burn this toxic waste, pollute the air and rip up the ozone!

1009
01:35:16,473 --> 01:35:19,031
Cos maybe if we screw this planet up enough

1010
01:35:20,078 --> 01:35:22,102
they won't want it any more.

1011
01:35:22,247 --> 01:35:23,873
Wait. David.

1012
01:35:23,981 --> 01:35:28,110
Don't do this to yourself. Listen to me. I'm listening.

1013
01:35:28,252 --> 01:35:32,880
Everyone loses faith at some point in their life. Even myself

1014
01:35:34,257 --> 01:35:36,917
I haven't spoken to God since your mother died.

1015
01:35:43,098 --> 01:35:46,930
You see, sometimes we have to remember what we still have.

1016
01:35:48,336 --> 01:35:49,893
Like what?

1017
01:35:52,738 --> 01:35:55,603
Well, you still have your health.

1018
01:35:57,710 --> 01:35:59,643
David, you need your rest.

1019
01:35:59,713 --> 01:36:03,614
Come on! Get off this freezing floor before you catch cold. Come on!

1020
01:36:06,617 --> 01:36:08,947
What did you just say? About faith?

1021
01:36:09,052 --> 01:36:11,746
Well, you see, a man...No.

1022
01:36:11,855 --> 01:36:16,552
The other part. What? I don't want you to catch cold.

1023
01:36:21,696 --> 01:36:24,128
What is that? What is the matter with you?

1024
01:36:24,265 --> 01:36:27,630
Genius. Genius?

1025
01:36:27,702 --> 01:36:30,168
My dad. A total genius

1026
01:36:32,038 --> 01:36:33,937
Jerry, wake up.

1027
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:37,030
We got work to do. Get everybody down here right away.

1028
01:36:41,881 --> 01:36:43,939
Look at that! Wow!

1029
01:36:44,050 --> 01:36:48,484
Does that thing really fly in outer space? It most certainly does.

1030
01:36:48,553 --> 01:36:51,486
Sure doesn't look like it. They're here.

1031
01:36:51,555 --> 01:36:54,681
All right, what's this all about? I have no idea.

1032
01:36:54,759 --> 01:36:59,490
Get everybody off. Right, clear the platform. Let's go.

1033
01:36:59,996 --> 01:37:02,963
Major Mitchell. Do you have a pistol? What?

1034
01:37:03,066 --> 01:37:06,090
Have you got a gun? Sergeant, your sidearm.

1035
01:37:07,669 --> 01:37:12,865
See that Coke can on top of the alien craft?
Think you can shoot that thing off?

1036
01:37:13,374 --> 01:37:15,932
Shoot it. Sir?

1037
01:37:17,377 --> 01:37:19,468
Go ahead.

1038
01:37:24,950 --> 01:37:28,008
What the hell are you doing? I'm sorry. My fault

1039
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:31,519
That Coke can was protected by the craft's shield.

1040
01:37:31,590 --> 01:37:34,148
We can't penetrate it. What's your point?

1041
01:37:34,225 --> 01:37:38,818
My point is, if we can't beat their
defenses, then we gotta get around them.

1042
01:37:38,930 --> 01:37:42,557
Major. One more time... Any time

1043
01:37:53,608 --> 01:37:56,769
How did you do that? I gave it a cold.

1044
01:37:57,945 --> 01:38:01,401
I gave it a virus. A computer virus

1045
01:38:02,016 --> 01:38:06,541
Are you telling us you can send out
a signal that will disable all their shields?

1046
01:38:06,619 --> 01:38:12,146
Just like they used our satellites against us,
we can use their own signal against them.

1047
01:38:12,224 --> 01:38:15,521
If we plant a virus into that mother ship,

1048
01:38:15,594 --> 01:38:19,461
it's gonna filter down into all the corresponding ships below.

1049
01:38:19,564 --> 01:38:26,160
I'm sorry. I don't understand. How exactly
do we infect the mother ship with this virus?

1050
01:38:26,237 --> 01:38:29,033
We're... We're gonna

1051
01:38:29,139 --> 01:38:33,664
have to... fly their alien craft out of our atmosphere and dock with it.

1052
01:38:33,776 --> 01:38:36,937
We can enter here, as shown in these satellite photos.

1053
01:38:37,012 --> 01:38:42,539
We then upload the virus, set off some
kind of explosion which'll disable it.

1054
01:38:42,617 --> 01:38:48,554
That'll disorient the smaller ships below and that could buy you some time to

1055
01:38:49,256 --> 01:38:52,155
to take them... take them out. Take them down.

1056
01:38:52,226 --> 01:38:54,954
Do your... Do your stuff.

1057
01:38:55,027 --> 01:38:58,985
This is ridiculous! How long would their shields be down?

1058
01:38:59,865 --> 01:39:02,923
Eh... I dunno. A matter of minutes

1059
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:08,459
You want us to coordinate a counterstrike with a window of a few minutes?

1060
01:39:08,573 --> 01:39:12,029
With shields down, it might be possible. Oh, please!

1061
01:39:12,109 --> 01:39:15,976
We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign!

1062
01:39:16,045 --> 01:39:18,511
Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan

1063
01:39:18,615 --> 01:39:23,710
depends on a machine that no one in this world is qualified to operate.

1064
01:39:23,819 --> 01:39:25,615
I wouldn't say that, sir.

1065
01:39:25,687 --> 01:39:30,588
I've seen them in action. I'm aware of their maneuvering capabilities.

1066
01:39:30,658 --> 01:39:34,285
With your permission, General, I'd like the opportunity to try.

1067
01:39:34,427 --> 01:39:37,326
That thing is a wreck.

1068
01:39:37,464 --> 01:39:41,193
It crash-landed in the '50s. We don't even know if it's capable of flying!

1069
01:39:41,267 --> 01:39:43,733
Jim, remove the clamps.

1070
01:40:06,221 --> 01:40:07,709
Any questions?

1071
01:40:12,627 --> 01:40:14,685
Let's do it.

1072
01:40:17,831 --> 01:40:19,627
All right, you heard the President...

1073
01:40:19,700 --> 01:40:23,156
Good luck, pilot. Thank you, Mr. President.

1074
01:40:23,269 --> 01:40:25,327
A virus

1075
01:40:25,838 --> 01:40:27,737
Your idea

1076
01:40:27,839 --> 01:40:29,897
That's right.

1077
01:40:35,646 --> 01:40:38,636
Do you really think you can fly that thing?

1078
01:40:38,716 --> 01:40:42,776
Do you really think you can do all that bullshit you just said?

1079
01:40:50,859 --> 01:40:53,519
I understand you are upset over your wife's death.

1080
01:40:53,596 --> 01:40:56,529
But that's no excuse for making another fatal mistake.

1081
01:40:56,598 --> 01:41:01,191
No, my mistake was to appoint a sniveling
weasel like you as Secretary of Defense.

1082
01:41:01,302 --> 01:41:04,098
You don't understand! However,

1083
01:41:04,171 --> 01:41:07,866
that is one mistake I am thankful to say that I don't have to live with.

1084
01:41:07,941 --> 01:41:10,703
Mr. President...Mr. Nimsiki,

1085
01:41:10,776 --> 01:41:13,368
you're fired.

1086
01:41:15,147 --> 01:41:19,276
Let's organize every plane we can find
and get us some goddamn pilots to fly them.

1087
01:41:19,350 --> 01:41:22,374
Yes, sir. He can't do that.

1088
01:41:22,519 --> 01:41:25,315
Well, he just did.

1089
01:41:29,159 --> 01:41:33,593
Command has attempted to list casualties
and losses, but information is sketchy.

1090
01:41:33,597 --> 01:41:36,428
We know they've lost the Belgian contingent in the Sinai.

1091
01:41:36,498 --> 01:41:41,433
There's a strong possibility reinforcements are hiding in the Golan Straits.

1092
01:41:43,138 --> 01:41:47,730
What is he saying? They're getting a signal. Old Morse code.

1093
01:42:00,687 --> 01:42:02,745
It's from the Americans.

1094
01:42:04,122 --> 01:42:06,452
They want to organize a counteroffensive!

1095
01:42:06,524 --> 01:42:09,548
It's about bloody time! What do they plan to do?

1096
01:42:31,845 --> 01:42:35,074
We have confirmed reports of combat-ready divisions

1097
01:42:35,148 --> 01:42:40,344
in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.
Impressive. Considering it's all done with

1098
01:42:40,486 --> 01:42:41,781
Morse code

1099
01:42:42,255 --> 01:42:45,950
The armed forces here? We have sufficient aircraft, but...

1100
01:42:46,059 --> 01:42:49,322
But what? Pilots are coming up short.

1101
01:42:49,393 --> 01:42:51,383
Well, then, find them.

1102
01:42:51,529 --> 01:42:56,088
Ham radio operators from New York to Japan
trade rumors of military forces in hiding,

1103
01:42:56,167 --> 01:43:00,396
unwilling to reveal themselves for fear of annihilation...

1104
01:43:01,405 --> 01:43:03,894
We're planning to launch a counteroffensive.

1105
01:43:03,973 --> 01:43:05,667
With our depleted manpower,

1106
01:43:05,742 --> 01:43:09,107
we're asking that anyone with flight experience come forward.

1107
01:43:09,178 --> 01:43:14,204
Military training is preferable, but anyone who can fly would be useful.

1108
01:43:15,116 --> 01:43:17,582
I can fly. I'm a pilot.

1109
01:43:20,221 --> 01:43:22,085
All right, guys! Listen up!

1110
01:43:22,155 --> 01:43:25,987
Pay attention. These F-18s are very different than the jets you piloted.

1111
01:43:26,093 --> 01:43:28,320
It's strong. Forgive the expression,

1112
01:43:28,395 --> 01:43:31,328
but this is a crash course in modern avionics.

1113
01:43:31,396 --> 01:43:34,022
Keep it coming. OK, you got it!

1114
01:43:34,132 --> 01:43:39,796
All right, listen up. First we need some
background information on your experience.

1115
01:43:39,903 --> 01:43:42,529
Let's start with you.

1116
01:43:42,606 --> 01:43:44,936
Who, me?

1117
01:43:45,175 --> 01:43:47,607
Well, I'm Russell Casse, sir.

1118
01:43:48,911 --> 01:43:52,937
And after 'Nam I got into crop-dusting.

1119
01:43:53,649 --> 01:43:56,742
And been doing that ever since

1120
01:43:56,817 --> 01:44:02,310
On a personal note, sir, I'd just like to add that

1121
01:44:02,291 --> 01:44:05,554
ever since I was kidnapped by aliens 10 years ago,

1122
01:44:05,660 --> 01:44:07,684
I have been dying for some payback.

1123
01:44:07,762 --> 01:44:11,720
I just want you to know that I won't let you down.

1124
01:44:13,566 --> 01:44:15,657
You have one tactical nuclear missile

1125
01:44:15,734 --> 01:44:19,065
we're loading into this launcher under the right wing.

1126
01:44:19,138 --> 01:44:21,162
This is the firing mechanism.

1127
01:44:21,273 --> 01:44:23,865
It'll be attached to the ship's main console.

1128
01:44:23,942 --> 01:44:26,169
Just like the AMr.aam launch pad on a Stealth.

1129
01:44:26,277 --> 01:44:28,869
Except the nuke will not detonate at impact

1130
01:44:29,946 --> 01:44:32,879
You'll have 30 seconds to get your asses out of there.

1131
01:44:33,884 --> 01:44:35,510
Good luck, gentlemen.

1132
01:44:36,552 --> 01:44:37,949
30 seconds.

1133
01:44:38,054 --> 01:44:42,283
It's the strongest radio transmitter we had.
It'll tell us when you've uploaded the virus.

1134
01:44:42,357 --> 01:44:45,324
30 seconds. Don't you think that's cutting it too close?

1135
01:44:45,392 --> 01:44:50,157
We're gonna be well on our way back home before we shoot that thing off.

1136
01:44:50,864 --> 01:44:53,262
Why you? David!

1137
01:44:53,334 --> 01:44:59,759
I don't understand why you can't show someone else how to plant the virus.

1138
01:44:59,871 --> 01:45:01,667
No. Something may go wrong.

1139
01:45:01,740 --> 01:45:04,673
I may have to think quickly, adjust the signal.

1140
01:45:04,744 --> 01:45:08,405
Who knows? Hey, you know how I'm always trying to save the planet?

1141
01:45:13,217 --> 01:45:15,308
Here's my chance.

1142
01:45:17,754 --> 01:45:19,812
Now he gets ambitious.

1143
01:45:20,389 --> 01:45:23,220
It's too tight. Well, I had to borrow it. Let me see.

1144
01:45:23,326 --> 01:45:26,122
OK. All right, I guess that's good enough.

1145
01:45:26,195 --> 01:45:28,319
So. How do I look?

1146
01:45:29,565 --> 01:45:32,123
Oh, thank you. You're a lot of help.

1147
01:45:34,836 --> 01:45:37,325
You're late! Well, you know me.

1148
01:45:37,404 --> 01:45:40,337
I know. You like to make a big entrance.

1149
01:45:41,009 --> 01:45:44,773
Listen. Before we do this, I just wanna say I'm sorry.

1150
01:45:44,845 --> 01:45:46,936
Sorry for what, babe?

1151
01:45:47,612 --> 01:45:50,807
I should have done this a long time ago.

1152
01:45:50,915 --> 01:45:54,008
Do you have the ring? Yes, sir.

1153
01:45:54,119 --> 01:45:56,346
Here, make yourself useful.

1154
01:46:00,257 --> 01:46:02,348
Witnesses?

1155
01:46:03,727 --> 01:46:07,990
We got hung up. Well, let's get this show on the road.

1156
01:46:08,064 --> 01:46:11,931
Dearly beloved, we're gathered here in the sight of God

1157
01:46:12,001 --> 01:46:14,228
and in the presence of these witnesses

1158
01:46:14,336 --> 01:46:17,963
to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony.

1159
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:22,032
Any person who can show good cause why these two should not wed,

1160
01:46:23,176 --> 01:46:26,575
please speak now or for ever hold your peace.

1161
01:46:28,681 --> 01:46:31,842
Steve, will you take this woman to be your wedded wife,

1162
01:46:31,950 --> 01:46:35,008
to live together with her in the holy state of matrimony?

1163
01:46:35,887 --> 01:46:40,686
Will you love her, comfort her, honor
and keep her in sickness and in health,

1164
01:46:40,792 --> 01:46:43,087
and, forsaking all others,

1165
01:46:43,193 --> 01:46:47,185
keep yourself only for her as long as you both shall live?

1166
01:46:47,664 --> 01:46:49,755
I will.

1167
01:47:01,108 --> 01:47:03,199
Good morning.

1168
01:47:06,715 --> 01:47:08,806
They're a little young.

1169
01:47:09,449 --> 01:47:11,507
That they are

1170
01:47:12,820 --> 01:47:14,787
They look a little nervous.

1171
01:47:14,854 --> 01:47:18,652
I need all flight crews to report to their designated areas.

1172
01:47:20,025 --> 01:47:22,787
Major. Can I borrow that? Sir.

1173
01:47:24,228 --> 01:47:25,888
Good morning.

1174
01:47:28,532 --> 01:47:31,090
Good morning.

1175
01:47:31,901 --> 01:47:34,231
In less than an hour,

1176
01:47:34,305 --> 01:47:39,036
aircraft from here will join others from around the world.

1177
01:47:39,108 --> 01:47:44,703
And you will be launching the largest
aerial battle in the history of mankind.

1178
01:47:46,514 --> 01:47:51,540
Mankind. That word should have new meaning for all of us today.

1179
01:47:53,121 --> 01:47:56,316
We can't be consumed by our petty differences any more.

1180
01:47:58,291 --> 01:48:01,019
We will be united in our common interest.

1181
01:48:01,860 --> 01:48:05,886
Perhaps it's fate that today is the Fourth of July.

1182
01:48:07,098 --> 01:48:10,361
And you will once again be fighting for our freedom.

1183
01:48:11,703 --> 01:48:14,898
Not from tyranny, oppression or persecution.

1184
01:48:17,474 --> 01:48:20,100
But from annihilation

1185
01:48:20,509 --> 01:48:22,873
We're fighting for our right to live.

1186
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:25,945
To exist

1187
01:48:27,115 --> 01:48:29,581
And should we win the day,

1188
01:48:30,085 --> 01:48:34,382
the Fourth of July will no longer be known as an American holiday,

1189
01:48:35,556 --> 01:48:38,580
but as the day when the world declared in one voice,

1190
01:48:38,726 --> 01:48:41,192
We will not go quietly into the night!

1191
01:48:42,060 --> 01:48:44,993
We will not vanish without a fight!

1192
01:48:45,965 --> 01:48:48,056
We're going to live on!

1193
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:50,964
We're going to survive!

1194
01:48:51,336 --> 01:48:55,565
Today, we celebrate our Independence Day!

1195
01:49:20,527 --> 01:49:23,187
Let's go! Mr. President. Right this way, sir.

1196
01:49:23,729 --> 01:49:25,921
I've got your gear over here. Good luck!

1197
01:49:25,998 --> 01:49:30,329
I've got you a jump suit and your gear is here. You've got your choice of helmets.

1198
01:49:32,838 --> 01:49:36,237
Mr. President, I'd sure like to know what you're doing.

1199
01:49:36,341 --> 01:49:38,331
I'm a combat pilot, Will.

1200
01:49:40,578 --> 01:49:42,770
I belong in the air.

1201
01:49:49,319 --> 01:49:51,945
OK, sir. Let's get you airborne.

1202
01:49:55,791 --> 01:49:59,658
As soon as I get back, we're gonna light those fireworks, right?

1203
01:50:06,066 --> 01:50:08,828
Here. Take these.

1204
01:50:12,071 --> 01:50:13,662
Just in case.

1205
01:50:14,139 --> 01:50:15,434
Where's...

1206
01:50:26,484 --> 01:50:28,280
Just in case.

1207
01:50:30,786 --> 01:50:32,582
I'm very proud of you.

1208
01:50:44,432 --> 01:50:46,590
Be careful, OK?

1209
01:50:53,408 --> 01:50:55,466
It's time.

1210
01:51:00,446 --> 01:51:03,413
I love you. I love you.

1211
01:51:08,452 --> 01:51:11,044
Oh, damn! Wait a minute.

1212
01:51:11,122 --> 01:51:13,918
We gotta find some cigars. I can't...Here!

1213
01:51:14,026 --> 01:51:16,584
Take these. My last two

1214
01:51:17,061 --> 01:51:19,288
You are a lifesaver.

1215
01:51:19,829 --> 01:51:22,261
Almost put a hex on the whole damn thing!

1216
01:51:50,056 --> 01:51:52,248
Missile launch. Oh, crap!

1217
01:51:52,691 --> 01:51:54,487
What do I hit? Which one?

1218
01:51:56,727 --> 01:51:59,455
I picked a hell of a day to quit drinking.

1219
01:52:14,776 --> 01:52:17,140
This is our victory dance.

1220
01:52:17,245 --> 01:52:19,303
Not until the fat lady sings.

1221
01:52:19,380 --> 01:52:21,972
Oh. Yes, OK.

1222
01:52:22,083 --> 01:52:26,075
This is important. Fat lady. I gotcha

1223
01:52:28,088 --> 01:52:30,146
Open launch tunnel.

1224
01:52:49,472 --> 01:52:52,064
Shaky, huh? Is it gonna do this the whole way?

1225
01:52:52,142 --> 01:52:55,473
Make sure your seat backs are in their upright position.

1226
01:52:55,543 --> 01:52:57,008
Yeah. Is it?

1227
01:53:00,682 --> 01:53:01,977
Let's rock in roll.

1228
01:53:08,689 --> 01:53:09,949
Oops.

1229
01:53:10,023 --> 01:53:12,284
Oops? What does that mean?

1230
01:53:12,358 --> 01:53:15,325
No, I got it. Some jerk didn't put the thing...

1231
01:53:15,395 --> 01:53:18,328
What do you mean, saying "oops" there?

1232
01:53:18,397 --> 01:53:20,920
What do you say we try that one again, huh?

1233
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:23,923
Yes, without the oops.

1234
01:53:25,037 --> 01:53:27,229
That away!

1235
01:53:32,576 --> 01:53:34,837
I have got to get me one of these!

1236
01:53:44,386 --> 01:53:48,412
What was that? Don't do that! Just trying to get a feel for the old girl

1237
01:53:48,523 --> 01:53:50,989
No, don't. Leave her alone.

1238
01:53:51,059 --> 01:53:52,855
Look, no hands! Steve!

1239
01:53:57,397 --> 01:53:59,989
You're all secure, sir. Grey, do you read me?

1240
01:54:00,067 --> 01:54:03,466
Roger, Eagle One. Your primary target has shifted course.

1241
01:54:03,569 --> 01:54:06,365
Which way they headed? I think our secret's out.

1242
01:54:06,438 --> 01:54:08,337
They're headed straight for us.

1243
01:54:08,407 --> 01:54:10,873
ETA, 26 minutes

1244
01:54:14,778 --> 01:54:18,268
You still with me over there? What the hell was I thinking?

1245
01:54:29,292 --> 01:54:32,088
I've been waiting for this my whole life.

1246
01:54:43,603 --> 01:54:45,661
Head straight for it

1247
01:54:51,510 --> 01:54:53,999
What the hell? Don't touch them. Don't!

1248
01:54:54,079 --> 01:54:57,877
I was counting on this. They are bringing us in.

1249
01:54:58,849 --> 01:55:02,784
When the hell was you gonna tell me? Oops.

1250
01:55:04,788 --> 01:55:07,277
We've got to work on our communication.

1251
01:55:22,736 --> 01:55:26,694
We have visual. Do not engage until we've confirmed

1252
01:55:26,806 --> 01:55:28,930
the package has been delivered. Roger.

1253
01:55:34,446 --> 01:55:37,106
Major, what happens if that thing gets here

1254
01:55:37,683 --> 01:55:39,807
before the virus is planted?

1255
01:55:39,885 --> 01:55:42,545
This facility's buried deep within a mountain.

1256
01:55:42,654 --> 01:55:45,553
It should provide us some protection. Great

1257
01:55:45,656 --> 01:55:48,316
What about the people outside?

1258
01:55:55,497 --> 01:55:57,689
Lieutenant Sell? We got incoming.

1259
01:56:57,016 --> 01:56:58,481
Oh, my God.

1260
01:57:32,380 --> 01:57:34,438
Look at that.

1261
01:57:43,457 --> 01:57:47,586
There must be thousands of them. Millions. What the hell are they doing?

1262
01:57:48,394 --> 01:57:50,758
Looks like they're preparing an invasion

1263
01:58:18,286 --> 01:58:21,253
Hey, I don't like this! This is stupid. They can see us.

1264
01:58:21,355 --> 01:58:23,379
No. This thing comes fully loaded.

1265
01:58:23,457 --> 01:58:26,424
AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats and

1266
01:58:26,493 --> 01:58:28,551
power windows.

1267
01:58:44,375 --> 01:58:45,897
Come on, baby.

1268
01:58:48,412 --> 01:58:50,470
We're in.

1269
01:58:55,717 --> 01:58:57,513
Do it.

1270
01:58:57,819 --> 01:58:59,011
Do it.

1271
01:58:59,088 --> 01:59:01,418
Sir, he's uploading the virus.

1272
01:59:01,490 --> 01:59:03,682
Eagle One, the package is being delivered.

1273
01:59:03,792 --> 01:59:05,850
Stand by to engage.

1274
01:59:07,261 --> 01:59:09,488
Roger. Eagle One, check left

1275
01:59:13,634 --> 01:59:15,895
Listen up! We have an emergency situation.

1276
01:59:16,003 --> 01:59:18,298
We need you to grab everything you can.

1277
01:59:18,404 --> 01:59:22,271
Only what you can carry. We need to get you inside immediately.

1278
01:59:25,944 --> 01:59:28,035
The virus is in.

1279
01:59:32,850 --> 01:59:35,646
All we can do now is pray.

1280
01:59:36,654 --> 01:59:40,452
Delivery complete. Engage. Delivery complete. It's a go!

1281
01:59:40,523 --> 01:59:42,853
Eagle One. Fox three.

1282
01:59:46,929 --> 01:59:48,691
Gentlemen, this is it.

1283
01:59:51,699 --> 01:59:53,857
Come on, come on.

1284
02:00:06,846 --> 02:00:08,710
Virus ineffective. Disengage.

1285
02:00:08,781 --> 02:00:10,748
Get your people out. Disengage.

1286
02:00:10,850 --> 02:00:12,908
Rear flank, follow suit.

1287
02:00:14,184 --> 02:00:16,844
Hold on, Command.

1288
02:00:16,921 --> 02:00:21,050
I want another shot at it. Sir, I strongly recommend you disengage.

1289
02:00:21,125 --> 02:00:24,115
Eagle One. Fox three.

1290
02:00:38,172 --> 02:00:42,107
Direct hit! It's a hit! Squadron leaders, fire at will!

1291
02:00:42,742 --> 02:00:45,504
We're going in. Squadron leaders, take flight.

1292
02:00:47,113 --> 02:00:48,977
Eagle Six at seven. Eagle Five at three.

1293
02:00:49,082 --> 02:00:51,106
Eagle One. Fox two.

1294
02:00:51,183 --> 02:00:52,705
Eagle Twenty! Fox two!

1295
02:01:01,691 --> 02:01:04,988
Evasive maneuvers! Squadron leaders, evasive maneuvers!

1296
02:01:06,196 --> 02:01:08,560
Prepare to engage!

1297
02:01:12,100 --> 02:01:15,499
All right, Mr. President! Here we go!

1298
02:01:15,571 --> 02:01:17,595
All right, baby. I've gotcha!

1299
02:01:19,641 --> 02:01:21,936
Payback's a bitch, aingt it?

1300
02:01:23,845 --> 02:01:26,140
OK. Job's done. Let's go home.

1301
02:01:26,646 --> 02:01:28,408
Gladly.

1302
02:01:32,519 --> 02:01:34,780
What's up? It's stuck.

1303
02:01:34,854 --> 02:01:37,012
What? It's not responding. It's stuck.

1304
02:01:37,122 --> 02:01:38,451
Try it again.

1305
02:01:53,270 --> 02:01:55,600
Come on!

1306
02:02:11,853 --> 02:02:13,752
Come on! Inside!

1307
02:02:13,820 --> 02:02:16,810
Go to the elevator! Hurry!

1308
02:02:28,032 --> 02:02:29,589
Steve!

1309
02:02:35,707 --> 02:02:38,868
What are you doing? They're overriding the system.

1310
02:02:38,975 --> 02:02:40,497
Oh, shit!

1311
02:02:41,845 --> 02:02:43,310
Hide.

1312
02:02:48,675 --> 02:02:52,006
Everybody hold someone's hand. Hold hands.

1313
02:02:52,079 --> 02:02:53,237
Come on in.

1314
02:02:56,516 --> 02:02:59,711
I'm not Jewish. Nobody's perfect.

1315
02:03:03,238 --> 02:03:05,636
Are you scared?

1316
02:03:05,773 --> 02:03:06,999
Me, too

1317
02:03:08,712 --> 02:03:10,641
Eagle Seven, fox two

1318
02:03:10,713 --> 02:03:13,343
Eagle Three, fox two

1319
02:03:18,720 --> 02:03:22,347
We're running out of missiles, sir. We're not causing enough damage.

1320
02:03:22,421 --> 02:03:24,081
It's directly over us.

1321
02:03:33,231 --> 02:03:35,629
They're preparing to fire their primary weapon!

1322
02:03:35,735 --> 02:03:38,201
Then let's take it out before it takes us out.

1323
02:03:43,707 --> 02:03:45,606
Target at 12 o'clock!

1324
02:03:47,710 --> 02:03:49,232
My God! They're everywhere!

1325
02:03:50,813 --> 02:03:53,177
Bandits on our tail! Locked on! I see them.

1326
02:03:56,585 --> 02:03:58,846
Squadron leaders, I want a weapons check!

1327
02:04:00,556 --> 02:04:03,114
You're outta time! Disable it now!

1328
02:04:06,860 --> 02:04:09,520
I'm in range. Locking on

1329
02:04:09,597 --> 02:04:12,189
I've got tone. Eagle One, fox two!

1330
02:04:21,941 --> 02:04:23,669
That is a negative impact.

1331
02:04:23,775 --> 02:04:25,866
That is an NI. Negative impact

1332
02:04:26,578 --> 02:04:28,942
I'm out of missiles. Eagle Two!

1333
02:04:29,012 --> 02:04:30,569
I'm on it.

1334
02:04:33,617 --> 02:04:34,673
Jesus!

1335
02:04:37,019 --> 02:04:40,578
All missiles have been fired. Outta time! Get your ass outta there!

1336
02:04:40,656 --> 02:04:43,145
We're not done yet! Get as far away as you can!

1337
02:04:43,224 --> 02:04:45,214
Doesn't anyone have any missiles left?

1338
02:04:45,293 --> 02:04:47,451
Sorry I'm late, Mr. President!

1339
02:04:51,265 --> 02:04:52,696
I got hung up back there!

1340
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:56,165
Pilot, you armed? Armed and ready, sir!

1341
02:04:56,236 --> 02:04:57,793
I'm packing!

1342
02:04:59,205 --> 02:05:01,363
Who is that guy? Put him on speaker.

1343
02:05:01,441 --> 02:05:03,805
Pilot, identify yourself. It's me!

1344
02:05:03,875 --> 02:05:05,501
Russell Casse, sir.

1345
02:05:06,311 --> 02:05:08,369
I told you I wouldn't let you down!

1346
02:05:08,447 --> 02:05:11,642
Just keep those guys off me for a few more seconds, will you?

1347
02:05:11,716 --> 02:05:16,845
OK. Echo Niner, Echo Seven, take flanking
positions. Look after this guy, OK?

1348
02:05:17,286 --> 02:05:20,776
All right, boys. Let's give Mr. Casse some cover!

1349
02:05:20,857 --> 02:05:23,722
Gentlemen! Let's plough the road!

1350
02:05:31,699 --> 02:05:33,666
We'll draw them off and it's all yours!

1351
02:05:34,901 --> 02:05:37,093
Look out! Coming through!

1352
02:05:39,139 --> 02:05:41,230
I've got tone.

1353
02:05:42,075 --> 02:05:44,633
Eagle Twenty. Fox two.

1354
02:05:51,816 --> 02:05:53,646
Eagle Twenty. Fox two.

1355
02:05:56,921 --> 02:05:58,284
It's jammed.

1356
02:05:59,289 --> 02:06:01,119
It won't fire.

1357
02:06:04,528 --> 02:06:05,720
Dammit!

1358
02:06:16,437 --> 02:06:18,495
Do me a favor.

1359
02:06:20,473 --> 02:06:24,305
Tell my children I love them very much.

1360
02:06:27,347 --> 02:06:29,539
All right, you alien assholes!

1361
02:06:30,582 --> 02:06:33,242
In the words of my generation,

1362
02:06:33,318 --> 02:06:37,310
up yours!

1363
02:06:37,855 --> 02:06:39,252
Dad! What's he doing?

1364
02:06:39,323 --> 02:06:40,720
Come on, baby!

1365
02:06:40,793 --> 02:06:42,884
Come on, baby, come on!

1366
02:06:45,896 --> 02:06:47,327
Good luck, buddy.

1367
02:06:55,937 --> 02:06:59,997
Hello, boys! I'm back!

1368
02:07:21,425 --> 02:07:25,018
He did it! The son of a bitch did it!

1369
02:07:27,998 --> 02:07:29,190
All right!

1370
02:07:52,053 --> 02:07:55,509
What your father did was very brave.

1371
02:07:55,589 --> 02:07:58,317
You should be proud of him.

1372
02:07:58,391 --> 02:08:00,255
I am.

1373
02:08:17,441 --> 02:08:21,670
We know how to take them out, General. Spread the word.

1374
02:08:24,680 --> 02:08:28,205
Get on the wire to every squadron around the world.

1375
02:08:28,283 --> 02:08:31,546
Tell them how to bring those sons of bitches down.

1376
02:08:45,358 --> 02:08:46,755
What do you think?

1377
02:08:48,763 --> 02:08:50,228
Checkmate.

1378
02:09:16,251 --> 02:09:21,243
Well, it's funny. I always thought things like these would kill me.

1379
02:09:33,266 --> 02:09:35,789
It's been a pleasure.

1380
02:09:35,902 --> 02:09:37,128
Steve, you too

1381
02:09:41,241 --> 02:09:43,071
Only one thing left to do.

1382
02:09:49,615 --> 02:09:52,343
Ready? Yes, sir.

1383
02:09:58,755 --> 02:10:01,950
Hey, all right! Look at us.

1384
02:10:02,058 --> 02:10:05,423
Take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye!

1385
02:10:05,494 --> 02:10:08,552
Y'all take care. Nothing but love for you! Goodbye!

1386
02:10:10,432 --> 02:10:12,762
Do you think they know what's about to happen?

1387
02:10:12,901 --> 02:10:15,299
Not a chance in hell. Good night!

1388
02:10:22,643 --> 02:10:23,506
Peace!

1389
02:10:37,722 --> 02:10:40,052
We're loose. Can you get us outta here in 30 seconds?

1390
02:10:40,123 --> 02:10:44,149
I aingt heard no fat lady! Forget the fat lady. Drive us outta here!

1391
02:10:52,768 --> 02:10:54,530
They're chasing us. You think?

1392
02:11:03,010 --> 02:11:06,739
Oh, that was a hit. We're not hit! Stop side-seat driving!

1393
02:11:10,583 --> 02:11:12,981
Left! Tunnel! Exit left!

1394
02:11:13,085 --> 02:11:15,950
Where the hell do you think I'm going? OK. We're...

1395
02:11:34,703 --> 02:11:37,033
They're closing up on us. Shut up!

1396
02:11:37,138 --> 02:11:40,537
Go faster, must go faster. Go, go, go!

1397
02:11:53,586 --> 02:11:55,778
Elvis has left the building!

1398
02:11:55,854 --> 02:11:57,978
Thank you very much.

1399
02:11:58,056 --> 02:12:00,147
I love you, man.

1400
02:13:31,103 --> 02:13:34,400
They're going down all over the world, Tom. We got them beat.

1401
02:13:34,472 --> 02:13:37,633
How about our two delivery boys? Any word from them?

1402
02:13:41,078 --> 02:13:46,537
We lost contact with Captain Hiller and Levinson nearly 20 minutes ago.

1403
02:13:49,718 --> 02:13:51,081
Hold it!

1404
02:13:51,153 --> 02:13:53,745
Hold on, sir. I've got something on radar.

1405
02:14:41,395 --> 02:14:43,587
Sorry, sir.

1406
02:14:43,698 --> 02:14:44,924
Good job. Thank you.

1407
02:14:44,999 --> 02:14:47,761
Well done, Captain. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

1408
02:14:55,341 --> 02:14:56,397
David...

1409
02:14:58,911 --> 02:15:00,673
Not bad.

1410
02:15:03,781 --> 02:15:06,475
Thank you, Mr. President.

1411
02:15:07,352 --> 02:15:09,182
Not too bad at all.

1412
02:15:10,355 --> 02:15:12,821
Oh, so this is healthy?

1413
02:15:12,923 --> 02:15:15,583
Oh, I could get used to it.

1414
02:15:33,240 --> 02:15:35,432
Happy Fourth of July, Daddy.

1415
02:15:35,543 --> 02:15:37,601
Same to you, Munchkin

1416
02:15:39,446 --> 02:15:41,810
Didn't I promise you fireworks?

1417
02:15:41,915 --> 02:15:43,346
Yeah.
