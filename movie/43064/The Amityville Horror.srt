1
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,913
Jesus Christ!
It gets worse all the time!

2
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,314
Your job
doesn't get any better.

3
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,212
All shot in their beds,
execution style.

4
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,618
Only the mother
shot in the head.

5
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:48,555
What time you make it?
Give me a ballpark guess.

6
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,086
3:00... 3:15.

7
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:53,464
And that's pretty close.

8
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:55,523
Thanks.

9
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,998
How long
have you been waiting?

10
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,295
- Half an hour.
- Just a couple of minutes.

11
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,870
Over there,
that's the little gardening hut.

12
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,239
- You mean that's included?
- Sure.

13
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,367
It could be a guesthouse
with a little fixing up.

14
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:13,037
- A guesthouse?
- Sure.

15
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,979
Come on.
Right up here.

16
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:20,781
See how much property you have?
Isn't that lovely?

17
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,353
Be careful. Don't trip.

18
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,158
You'll see what a beauty this is.

19
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:39,628
There's nothing like it
on the market.

20
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,401
Not at this price.

21
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,177
- Come in.
- Thank you.

22
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:48,736
Impressive, isn't it?

23
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,717
I mean,
that's what I call charming.

24
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:54,844
- I'll show you the living room.
- Thank you.

25
00:05:56,322 --> 00:06:00,918
That's a wood-burning fireplace.
It'll be nice on cold nights.

26
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:09,767
That's the sun porch.
Nice, isn't it?

27
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,828
- George, I don't think...
- Be cool.

28
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:16,807
- Would you like to see the kitchen?
- Yes, thank you.

29
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,468
This is the kitchen.

30
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,377
Nice and spacious, isn't it?
Really big.

31
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:24,348
Has all the original hardware,
and everything works.

32
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,152
This your first house?

33
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:31,889
We just got married.

34
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,825
Shall we look at the upstairs?

35
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:39,922
I like to refer to this as a fixer-upper
that can be fun.

36
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,597
We'll start with this.

37
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,007
This is an extra room.

38
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,317
This is the bathroom
connecting with the next bedroom.

39
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,521
This is the second bedroom.

40
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,963
There's a nice view
of the river from here.

41
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:19,929
If you're planning on a big family,
there are three full bedrooms.

42
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,940
We already have a family.

43
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,101
Two boys and a girl.
Great kids.

44
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,911
You are so bad.

45
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,677
- What?
- Cut it out.

46
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,488
Next is the master bedroom.

47
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,803
I love it.

48
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:01,946
There's just one more floor.

49
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,082
See anything you like...

50
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,555
we can include it in the price.

51
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,118
- Really?
- Sure.

52
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:29,238
This can be another bedroom...
or a playroom, whichever you prefer.

53
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:40,745
We'll wander around on our own again
now that we got the layout.

54
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,651
We can meet you downstairs.

55
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:45,216
How would that be?

56
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:49,391
I'll be in the kitchen.
Take your time.

57
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,362
We won't be long.

58
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:59,062
- What do you think?
- I love it.

59
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:05,302
Honey... $80,000?

60
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:11,842
I mean...
it might as well be $800,000.

61
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,350
Listen...

62
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:23,885
The house is worth
$120,000 easy.

63
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:29,525
If I move my office into that cottage
out back, that'll save that rent.

64
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:30,899
And the boathouse...

65
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,530
means I won't have to shell out
for mooring charges,

66
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,369
which they're raising,
by the way.

67
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,306
You didn't tell me that.

68
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:39,503
There was nothing
to be done about it.

69
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,747
I just wish that...

70
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,806
all those people
hadn't died here.

71
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:51,455
A guy kills his whole family?
Doesn't that bother you?

72
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:55,654
Sure, but...
houses don't have memories.

73
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,457
I don't know.

74
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,890
I do. The house
wouldn't even be for sale,

75
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,937
and if it was,
we couldn't afford it

76
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:08,667
if we had...
tuna casseroles for a year.

77
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,574
You're gonna be very happy.
It's a wonderful house.

78
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,044
I'm sure they'll accept your offer.

79
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,913
Don't worry about a thing.
I'll handle the details.

80
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,146
Just go on
and get ready to move.

81
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,941
They're not getting
too close to the river?

82
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,608
Uh-uh.

83
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,051
Sounds like a regular daddy
I hear over there.

84
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,784
I might feel like one if that's what they
started calling me instead of George.

85
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:36,794
Which I admit is better than that
Mr. Lutz crap they were giving me.

86
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,792
What do you
want to do with this?

87
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:48,532
Put it in the living room
on that wall beside the bookshelf,

88
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,167
and the light will come through...
it'll look beautiful.

89
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:53,938
You got it.

90
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,556
Voilà!

91
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,655
Aw, shit. Come on.

92
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,342
I'm tired of
this damn sticky paper.

93
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:31,008
I wish I'd listened to my mother
and gotten the kind that you tack down.

94
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,675
Nobody likes a quitter.

95
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:35,213
But I got an idea.

96
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,517
Get a couple of beers
and go outside and play?

97
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,061
What are those monsters up to?

98
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:01,072
Hello?

99
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,348
Anybody home?

100
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:05,979
Hello?

101
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,087
George?

102
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,254
Kathy?

103
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:18,159
Anybody home?

104
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,366
Hello?

105
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,230
God's peace in this house.

106
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,743
Get out. 

107
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,115
Get out!

108
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,243
Amy?

109
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,443
Honey, dinner's ready.

110
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,211
- I'll get her.
- I've got her.

111
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,712
You and the boys start.

112
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,306
I'll take her upstairs
and put her to bed.

113
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,122
She wasn't outside!

114
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,988
Where was she?

115
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:53,395
Be getting in there
and eat your hot dogs.

116
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,447
- Hello?
- Hell...

117
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,651
Hello, Kathy?

118
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,692
Can you hear me?

119
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:33,067
Father Delaney.
There's something very import...

120
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,171
Hello? Hello?

121
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,185
- Who was that?
- On the phone?

122
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,742
Yeah.

123
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,914
Just a bunch of static,
a bad connection or something.

124
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,686
I think Ma Bell's
gone wacko again.

125
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:35,026
Probably discover it was a collect call
from Japan when the bill comes.

126
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,933
Did you make sure that
Amy's got her doll with her?

127
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,665
Yeah. She's sleeping with it.

128
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,733
You hungry, honey?

129
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:48,407
You don't want one of those charbroiled
hot dogs I did especially for you?

130
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:51,982
No, I'm not hungry.

131
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:59,182
Damn, it's cold in here.

132
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:03,488
It felt cold a bit earlier,
but I think I've warmed up now.

133
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:08,224
It says 72.
It feels like 32.

134
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,693
Do you know
what I think it is?

135
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,294
There's a draft that
comes up from the basement

136
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:14,964
through that door down there.

137
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,344
This house is supposed to be
well insulated.

138
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,745
They'll nickel-and-dime you
to death.

139
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:18,095
Matt?

140
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:21,168
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

141
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,200
- Did you hurt yourself?
- No.

142
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:26,767
Those stairs are tricky.

143
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,837
Come on.
I'll take you upstairs.

144
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,574
We'll check
this all out tomorrow.

145
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,661
I'm sorry, baby.
I didn't mean to scare you.

146
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,599
I look at you all the time.

147
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:26,527
I can't get used to you.

148
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,369
Who loves you?

149
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,207
I'm lucky.

150
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:42,317
- Come here.
- I just wanted to clean up first.

151
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,926
I love the way
you smell right now.

152
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,439
I love you.

153
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,277
I love you back.

154
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:23,691
You make me feel like a kid
in the back seat of a car.

155
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:35,666
I want us to work.
I want to be the best.

156
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,004
I don't want you
to have any regrets.

157
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:41,068
I love you, Kathy.

158
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:40,998
I want to go home.

159
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:45,232
Mommy, I want to go home.

160
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,278
What's this trouble?

161
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:49,370
Come on, back to bed.

162
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:52,808
This is our home.
Don't you know that?

163
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,013
There we go.

164
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,651
There you go, sweetie.

165
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:03,386
What's the matter,
having mean dreams?

166
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:08,227
Sleep tight.

167
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:50,666
It's not so easy, is it?

168
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:55,642
I guess people
have had to deal with this

169
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:58,615
ever since Adam and Eve
got kicked out of the Garden.

170
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,917
Just have to learn
to live with it.

171
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:09,186
Thank you.

172
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:06,200
You're one hell
of a watchdog, Harry.

173
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:12,909
Come on, boy.
Come on.

174
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:36,364
What do you say?
Looks okay, huh?

175
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:22,139
Don't ever do that.

176
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,645
Not to a man
with an ax in his hand.

177
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:28,508
I thought
I could get a little help.

178
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:33,119
- Look what you made me do.
- I made you do?

179
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:36,592
There's a week's worth of groceries
rolling down the walk.

180
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:40,529
- Wait till I finish this stuff.
- George, finish?

181
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:43,692
You have got enough wood here
to heat the whole South Shore.

182
00:31:57,548 --> 00:31:58,879
You take this.

183
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:01,215
I'll get the rest.

184
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:02,548
I love you.

185
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:10,317
Broke a bulb.

186
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,233
Who drinks this
fancy kind of tea around here?

187
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:19,429
That's for Aunt Helena.
She's coming by around 2:00.

188
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:23,434
- Give me a break.
- Come on, be nice.

189
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,237
This is a big event
in my family.

190
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,608
We've always been
a bunch of renters.

191
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,307
This is the first time
anyone's bought a house.

192
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:33,077
Damn regimental inspection,
and we're not ready.

193
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:31,897
Sweetie pie, you scared me.
What do you want?

194
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:34,103
My friend Jody
wants to play upstairs.

195
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,703
Huh, Jody? See?

196
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:39,579
You and Jody go on up
and enjoy yourself.

197
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:42,175
Does your friend Jody
like sugar cookies, too?

198
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:46,047
- I don't think so.
- No?

199
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:49,453
Off you go.

200
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:09,509
This is Kathy Lutz. 
Could I speak with Father Delarey?

201
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,275
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lutz.

202
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:13,817
The Father's not
feeling very well today.

203
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,375
He's asleep right now.

204
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:18,517
This is Father Bolen.
May I help you?

205
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:20,079
Father Bolen...

206
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:23,389
He was supposed to come by
and bless the house yesterday,

207
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,486
but it can wait
till he feels better.

208
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,791
I hope he's not too sick?

209
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:28,991
I think it's just
one of those flu things.

210
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:33,131
But, Mrs. Lutz, the Father
was at your house yesterday.

211
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:35,434
We were expecting him,
but he never showed up.

212
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:38,270
I know he left
to go there.

213
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:40,503
He didn’t come. 
We waited all day. 

214
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,842
Must've been
some kind of mix-up.

215
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:46,315
No big deal. 
Just tell him "hi" and... 

216
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:48,784
and that we hope
he's feeling better.

217
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:51,321
I sure will.
Thank you for calling.

218
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:25,588
I'll check Amy's bathroom.

219
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:30,789
Oh, does it stink!

220
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:35,763
Mom, it stinks!

221
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:52,214
Go down and let Aunt Helena in
and don't tell her about this, okay?

222
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,342
Do we have to?
She's always pinching!

223
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:55,680
- Go now!
- Come on.

224
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:57,084
Go on!

225
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:59,083
And be polite.

226
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:08,587
Well, hello... Matthew!

227
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,634
And Gregory!

228
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,225
And Harry!

229
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:13,964
Where's your mother, dear?

230
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:15,903
She said she'd
be down in a minute.

231
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,810
Aunt Helena?

232
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,370
Kathleen! I'm sorry.

233
00:36:57,448 --> 00:37:00,110
I must've set it
too near the edge.

234
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:03,153
- I have to go.
- I don't understand.

235
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,155
I don't feel well at all.

236
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,886
I bought your favorite tea,
and I'll make you a cup.

237
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,929
I have to go.
I really feel terrible.

238
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:14,590
- If you rested a while, you'd feel...
- I can't stay!

239
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:17,657
- Please stay.
- I can't stay!

240
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,499
- I don't feel well!
- If you just rest and...

241
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:23,199
I can't stay. Forgive me.

242
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:25,242
George, please make her...

243
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:21,088
- Aren't you gonna come to bed?
- In a minute.

244
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,524
The fire went out.

245
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,390
Are you still cold?

246
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,170
I hope you're not
coming down with something.

247
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,607
I'll be all right.

248
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:42,101
I gotta stay healthy
for your brother's wedding.

249
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,023
Your hair's getting long.

250
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,921
Maybe you should
sleep in tomorrow.

251
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:03,960
I got work to do.

252
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:07,435
I don't want to be
up to my ass in boxes forever.

253
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,247
I'm sorry.

254
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:25,679
I don't know what
the hell's the matter with me.

255
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:30,122
- Silly, this happens all the time.
- Not to me it doesn't.

256
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:33,955
Stop pushing. You don't
have to prove anything to me.

257
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:51,875
Turn out the light.

258
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:04,721
I love you.

259
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:07,129
I love you back.

260
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:34,123
She was shot in the head!

261
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:43,530
You all right?

262
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,389
- Tell me something, Father.
- What?

263
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:18,892
Why couldn't this
wait till tomorrow?

264
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,428
I don't know. I...

265
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,331
All I know is
I have to get back to that house.

266
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:32,111
- Are you feeling all right?
- I'm fine. Fine, fine.

267
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:42,288
Father, there's something wrong
with the steering wheel.

268
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,628
I can't move the wheel.

269
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,307
What's wrong with this?

270
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,413
Harry, be quiet!

271
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:42,612
Be quiet!

272
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,605
Will you check this, please?

273
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,944
It's gotta come to 1,500 bucks
for the caterer.

274
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:15,543
- That sucker wants cash.
- Jimmy, will you relax?

275
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:18,110
You've counted it
about a thousand times.

276
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:26,925
You sure do look terrific.

277
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,133
You're not gonna
start to cry already?

278
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:43,807
It's just that yesterday,

279
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:46,349
I was riding you around
on the back of my bike.

280
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:48,745
And now you're getting married.

281
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:50,745
I sure am.

282
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:58,084
I'm just real happy for you.
That's all, hon.

283
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:07,730
Hey, there he is.

284
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,976
- George, you look terrible!
- So she keeps telling me.

285
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,534
It's some kind of
flu virus going around.

286
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:17,307
Amy's got it, too.
It's nothing.

287
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:20,179
If you're not up to it,
I'd understand.

288
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,218
I'm your best man.

289
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,880
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

290
00:45:25,956 --> 00:45:29,357
Mrs. Lutz, am I supposed to
give Amy an aspirin or anything?

291
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:31,917
Just give her one
before bed, okay?

292
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:32,984
Okay.

293
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:36,966
- Are you gonna be okay?
- I don't know.

294
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:41,869
What's the matter?

295
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:46,100
- The money.
- What money?

296
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:48,144
The money for the caterer.
$1,500.

297
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:49,839
I put it in this pocket.

298
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,939
- It must've fallen out.
- It's not here.

299
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:56,013
I'll look under here.

300
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,684
Did you check your pants?

301
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:06,827
Calm down. It can't have
gotten up and walked away.

302
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:08,660
If you had it here,
it's gotta be here.

303
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:10,029
What am I gonna do?

304
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:12,433
I can't believe it!

305
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:19,542
Will you get those kids
off that horn?

306
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,134
Jimmy, George.

307
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:24,542
We have to go.
We're getting very late.

308
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:25,946
What am I gonna do?

309
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:29,477
It's gotta be here someplace.

310
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:31,111
We'll look when we get home.

311
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:32,712
What about the caterer?

312
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,027
I'll take care of him.
I'll write him a check.

313
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:40,654
Sweetie.

314
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:42,427
Okay?

315
00:46:43,934 --> 00:46:45,231
I'll get the kids.

316
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:06,953
It's freezing in here!

317
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:13,494
It's time for bed, Amy.
I gotta give you an aspirin.

318
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:17,625
I don't wanna go to bed.
I wanna play with Jody.

319
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:19,896
Your mom said I had to
put you to bed early

320
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:21,597
because you've been sick.

321
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,264
Don't smart off to me.

322
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:27,037
I wasn't sick.
I just didn't like meatloaf.

323
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,305
Let's get you
into your pajamas.

324
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:53,130
Amy, open the door.

325
00:48:00,241 --> 00:48:02,573
I'm in the closet.
Open the door.

326
00:48:06,815 --> 00:48:08,646
Amy, I mean it!

327
00:48:15,757 --> 00:48:18,817
Come to the door!
Open it!

328
00:48:21,563 --> 00:48:24,794
For Christ's sake!
Open the door!

329
00:48:41,816 --> 00:48:44,148
Amy, open the door!

330
00:48:56,264 --> 00:48:58,858
For Christ's sake,
open the door!

331
00:49:24,659 --> 00:49:25,819
How are you?

332
00:49:26,861 --> 00:49:28,988
- Are you feeling better?
- Fine.

333
00:49:29,064 --> 00:49:30,759
I want to apologize
for the other day.

334
00:49:30,832 --> 00:49:32,732
- Don't worry.
- I don't know what happened.

335
00:49:32,801 --> 00:49:35,793
I hadn't gone half a block
from your house,

336
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:37,462
and I was violently ill.

337
00:49:37,539 --> 00:49:39,564
I think there's a virus
going around.

338
00:49:39,641 --> 00:49:42,439
Father Delaney's got something,
and Amy's got something.

339
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:45,536
And I don't know
what's the matter with George.

340
00:49:46,981 --> 00:49:49,814
I'll talk to you later, okay?

341
00:50:03,131 --> 00:50:04,621
I'm gonna write you a check.

342
00:50:06,601 --> 00:50:08,296
The deal was cash. Cash.

343
00:50:08,369 --> 00:50:10,963
The cash is lost.
You gotta take a check.

344
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:12,199
I don't like checks.

345
00:50:12,273 --> 00:50:14,537
Let me tell you something
about checks.

346
00:50:14,609 --> 00:50:16,839
Checks get cancelled.
Checks bounce.

347
00:50:17,912 --> 00:50:21,473
Checks is not cash.
Cash is cash.

348
00:50:21,549 --> 00:50:23,414
Listen to me, pal...

349
00:50:24,586 --> 00:50:26,417
I don't like lectures,

350
00:50:26,488 --> 00:50:29,423
and I don't like
being hassled in the men's room.

351
00:50:29,491 --> 00:50:31,118
I'm gonna write you a check.

352
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,860
Either that's
good enough for you,

353
00:50:33,928 --> 00:50:36,488
or you're gonna eat
your own goddamn food.

354
00:50:38,867 --> 00:50:39,959
Look at this...

355
00:50:40,034 --> 00:50:42,935
I want cash,
and they're giving me checks.

356
00:50:45,206 --> 00:50:46,366
You all right, honey?

357
00:50:46,441 --> 00:50:48,932
I don't think I can make it
through the reception.

358
00:50:49,911 --> 00:50:51,503
Let's get the kids and split.

359
00:50:51,579 --> 00:50:53,604
I'll get the kids.
You take it easy.

360
00:51:22,076 --> 00:51:23,270
Down.

361
00:51:27,382 --> 00:51:28,906
Matt, get over here.

362
00:51:34,422 --> 00:51:36,686
Matt, straight upstairs
and right to bed.

363
00:51:36,758 --> 00:51:38,123
- But why?
- Upstairs.

364
00:51:38,193 --> 00:51:40,286
- I'm not even tired!
- You are so tired.

365
00:51:40,361 --> 00:51:41,350
I am not!

366
00:51:41,429 --> 00:51:43,556
You're tired
'cause I said you're tired.

367
00:51:43,631 --> 00:51:44,996
Cut that out.

368
00:51:45,066 --> 00:51:47,500
I'll bring you
some milk and cookies.

369
00:51:48,703 --> 00:51:50,193
Let me out.

370
00:51:55,844 --> 00:51:57,675
Amy? Amy, are you okay?

371
00:52:01,282 --> 00:52:02,340
Jackie?

372
00:52:03,151 --> 00:52:06,348
- Oh, my God!
- I couldn't get out!

373
00:52:06,421 --> 00:52:08,082
The door closed
and it locked,

374
00:52:08,156 --> 00:52:09,646
and I couldn't get out!

375
00:52:09,724 --> 00:52:12,352
- There's no lock on this door.
- It wouldn't open.

376
00:52:12,427 --> 00:52:14,418
- Take a look.
- Look, see?

377
00:52:17,999 --> 00:52:19,660
It wouldn't open!

378
00:52:20,568 --> 00:52:23,366
Why didn't you open the door?
Why didn't you answer me?

379
00:52:24,772 --> 00:52:27,866
Why didn't you unlock the door?
You heard Jackie knocking.

380
00:52:27,942 --> 00:52:29,739
Jody wouldn't let me.

381
00:52:30,478 --> 00:52:31,638
Jody? Who's Jody?

382
00:52:31,713 --> 00:52:35,308
She's my friend.
She comes to play with me.

383
00:52:35,383 --> 00:52:38,841
Jesus Christ! What the hell
are we standing here listening to?

384
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,911
And weren't you told
to go to bed?

385
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:43,881
Go on! Get out of here!

386
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,720
These kids of yours need
some goddamn discipline.

387
00:52:53,167 --> 00:52:55,635
Here, let me see.
I'll go get something for them.

388
00:52:55,703 --> 00:52:59,195
- George yelled at me.
- You should've opened the door!

389
00:53:01,075 --> 00:53:03,600
Jody doesn't like George.

390
00:53:47,322 --> 00:53:50,155
Where the hell is it?!

391
00:53:54,729 --> 00:53:57,664
There's an explanation for all of it.

392
00:53:57,732 --> 00:54:00,792
I'm not in the habit of blaming Satan
for every phenomenon.

393
00:54:00,868 --> 00:54:02,028
Neither am I, Father.

394
00:54:02,103 --> 00:54:04,333
Well, for a modernist,

395
00:54:04,405 --> 00:54:06,999
who thought Vatican II
didn't go far enough,

396
00:54:07,075 --> 00:54:09,236
don't you think
you sound a little medieval?

397
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,378
My being a modernist
has nothing to do with it.

398
00:54:14,449 --> 00:54:16,679
I happened to
check into the murders

399
00:54:16,751 --> 00:54:18,946
and the 20-year-old boy
who killed his parents

400
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,453
and his four brothers and sisters.

401
00:54:20,521 --> 00:54:26,016
When he was at trial, he testified
that he heard voices in the house.

402
00:54:26,094 --> 00:54:27,959
The voices told him to do it!

403
00:54:28,029 --> 00:54:30,759
I was in the house,
and I heard the voices, too!

404
00:54:30,832 --> 00:54:33,027
And I also felt
the presence in the house.

405
00:54:33,101 --> 00:54:35,501
There was a presence
in that house!

406
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:39,336
Half the killers in this country
say the same thing.

407
00:54:39,407 --> 00:54:42,399
"The voices.
The voices told me to do it. "

408
00:54:42,477 --> 00:54:46,072
I heard them, Father!
I heard voices!

409
00:54:46,147 --> 00:54:48,843
Then explain my hand
if you can do that.

410
00:54:48,916 --> 00:54:51,407
Go on! Explain how
the car went out of control.

411
00:54:51,486 --> 00:54:53,818
Father Bolen was with me.
You tell him.

412
00:54:55,556 --> 00:54:57,717
The wheel locked,
and then the...

413
00:54:57,792 --> 00:54:59,589
The wheel locked.

414
00:55:00,628 --> 00:55:02,493
How about
a mechanical defect?

415
00:55:02,563 --> 00:55:05,498
I'd blame Detroit
a lot faster than the devil.

416
00:55:05,566 --> 00:55:09,263
Seems like every month
there's some kind of recall.

417
00:55:13,674 --> 00:55:18,236
I see. We're just gonna
walk away from it.

418
00:55:19,047 --> 00:55:21,447
Has that become
the fashion now, to cover up?

419
00:55:21,516 --> 00:55:23,575
Nothing to walk away from.

420
00:55:24,652 --> 00:55:27,553
- I think it's nonsense!
- There's nothing to cover up.

421
00:55:27,622 --> 00:55:31,023
I think
it's bureaucratical bullshit!

422
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,060
What do you think I am?

423
00:55:35,863 --> 00:55:39,299
I am not some
pink cheat seminarian

424
00:55:39,367 --> 00:55:40,959
who doesn't know the difference

425
00:55:41,035 --> 00:55:44,004
between the supernatural
and a bad clam.

426
00:55:44,072 --> 00:55:47,473
I am a trained psychotherapist!
I went into that house!

427
00:55:47,542 --> 00:55:50,909
What I saw there was real,
what I felt there was real,

428
00:55:50,978 --> 00:55:54,175
and what I
heard there was real!

429
00:55:54,248 --> 00:55:58,309
Gentlemen, I have a family
in my parish that's at great risk!

430
00:55:58,386 --> 00:56:00,547
And they are facing
real danger.

431
00:56:02,623 --> 00:56:05,717
Who the hell
do you think you are?!

432
00:56:05,793 --> 00:56:07,954
You think your secular education

433
00:56:08,029 --> 00:56:10,998
gives you the right
to question the Church?

434
00:56:12,066 --> 00:56:13,192
Sit down!

435
00:56:15,002 --> 00:56:16,526
Sit!

436
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:31,447
You haven't told us one thing

437
00:56:31,519 --> 00:56:35,011
that can't be written off
as simple hysteria.

438
00:56:35,656 --> 00:56:40,423
Even psychotherapists
lose touch with reality sometimes.

439
00:56:40,995 --> 00:56:44,328
Your education
doesn't give you any immunity.

440
00:56:46,801 --> 00:56:50,464
Father Nuncio and I
have seen our share of phenomena,

441
00:56:50,538 --> 00:56:54,872
and never once did any of them
turn out to be Satanist!

442
00:56:59,347 --> 00:57:02,180
Let's understand each other, Father.

443
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:08,589
To me, the Church...

444
00:57:10,057 --> 00:57:11,388
It's my home.

445
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:16,428
The Church is my strength.

446
00:57:23,738 --> 00:57:25,729
And I need her now.

447
00:57:25,806 --> 00:57:28,536
And that family...

448
00:57:28,609 --> 00:57:31,601
needs her... now.

449
00:57:37,618 --> 00:57:39,017
Frank...

450
00:57:39,854 --> 00:57:42,687
How long has it been
since you've seen your family?

451
00:57:47,962 --> 00:57:49,224
What do you mean?

452
00:57:49,297 --> 00:57:52,130
We think you
should take a vacation.

453
00:57:56,938 --> 00:57:58,337
Good morning, Father.

454
00:57:58,406 --> 00:58:00,601
Good day, Father.

455
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:04,471
You could do
with a haircut and shave.

456
00:58:46,153 --> 00:58:48,519
- What do you think?
- Very uptown.

457
00:58:48,589 --> 00:58:50,181
I thought you guys
had a small business.

458
00:58:50,258 --> 00:58:53,523
Believe me, we do.
Getting smaller all the time.

459
00:58:55,162 --> 00:58:56,561
What's the matter?

460
00:59:00,301 --> 00:59:02,132
I don't want to go any closer.

461
00:59:03,137 --> 00:59:05,970
Carolyn, what are you
talking about?

462
00:59:08,442 --> 00:59:09,932
It gives me the creeps.

463
00:59:31,299 --> 00:59:34,063
Hiya, George.
How's it going?

464
00:59:38,005 --> 00:59:40,940
I wouldn't have come out
and bothered you,

465
00:59:41,008 --> 00:59:42,669
but your line's always busy.

466
00:59:42,743 --> 00:59:45,439
Nobody's seen you for days.

467
00:59:47,081 --> 00:59:49,606
You haven't been in
to sign the payroll checks.

468
00:59:50,651 --> 00:59:52,881
I did us both a favor
and brought them along.

469
00:59:52,953 --> 00:59:56,116
- Here.
- What day is this?

470
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:57,418
Thursday.

471
00:59:59,627 --> 01:00:01,117
Thursday.

472
01:00:05,933 --> 01:00:09,232
I promised the men
I'd hand-deliver these.

473
01:00:09,303 --> 01:00:11,237
Should've been paid yesterday.

474
01:00:13,908 --> 01:00:17,867
Some caterer's screaming you wrote
him a personal check that bounced.

475
01:00:20,848 --> 01:00:22,213
I should've covered that.

476
01:00:22,283 --> 01:00:24,478
And some guy from the IRS
has been calling.

477
01:00:24,552 --> 01:00:26,713
Don't you have any good news?

478
01:00:31,058 --> 01:00:36,325
Yeah... I brought you
the spotlight for your boat.

479
01:00:42,570 --> 01:00:45,038
Come on.
I'll put it on for you.

480
01:01:04,692 --> 01:01:07,684
You girls think I don't know
what you're up to?

481
01:01:07,762 --> 01:01:09,923
Well, I do.

482
01:01:09,997 --> 01:01:15,128
And if I ever catch you again,
you're gonna be in big trouble.

483
01:01:15,202 --> 01:01:19,366
You girls hear me?
Janet, you listening?

484
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,806
Now, don't be a smart-ass.

485
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:29,179
You quit that!
Stop teasing me!

486
01:01:33,254 --> 01:01:36,246
What are you two rascals
doing in my room?

487
01:01:44,098 --> 01:01:45,861
Oh, my God!

488
01:01:54,241 --> 01:01:56,539
Goddamn thing feels like
it's nailed shut.

489
01:01:58,946 --> 01:02:01,437
Push! Can't you just get it up?

490
01:02:28,442 --> 01:02:30,876
Hold it up.
Don't let that down.

491
01:02:30,945 --> 01:02:32,173
I'll drive, honey.

492
01:02:32,246 --> 01:02:34,180
- Amazing.
- What?

493
01:02:34,248 --> 01:02:36,307
Not one broken bone.

494
01:02:46,727 --> 01:02:48,627
George, are you awake?

495
01:02:53,033 --> 01:02:57,060
Isn't it strange that none of the bones
are broken in Greg's hand?

496
01:03:01,809 --> 01:03:03,970
I have to talk to you.

497
01:05:26,553 --> 01:05:28,043
- What was that?
- I don't know.

498
01:05:28,122 --> 01:05:30,215
- You stay up here.
- Like hell!

499
01:05:38,766 --> 01:05:40,996
Wait, wait.

500
01:05:53,414 --> 01:05:56,645
Goddammit!
Don't sneak up on me!

501
01:05:57,618 --> 01:06:00,587
You call the police.
I'm gonna go check on something.

502
01:06:00,654 --> 01:06:01,951
It's okay, sweetie.

503
01:06:59,646 --> 01:07:03,207
- Sarge, what brings you out?
- Insomnia.

504
01:07:11,492 --> 01:07:14,552
- What do you got?
- Beats the hell out of me.

505
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:36,478
- What do you got?
- This is Mrs. Lutz, Sergeant.

506
01:07:36,550 --> 01:07:37,949
Mrs. Lutz.

507
01:07:39,086 --> 01:07:40,849
And George Lutz.

508
01:07:49,429 --> 01:07:52,489
- Is that L-u-t-z-e?
- No "e".

509
01:07:52,566 --> 01:07:54,761
The basement door's
the same as the front.

510
01:07:57,204 --> 01:08:00,469
- Where's the basement?
- Come on, I'll show you.

511
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:24,424
Who let you in?

512
01:08:25,899 --> 01:08:27,526
What are you
doing there, boy?

513
01:08:33,207 --> 01:08:34,799
No broken windows.

514
01:08:38,145 --> 01:08:40,136
How long you been living here?

515
01:08:40,214 --> 01:08:41,738
A couple of weeks.

516
01:08:43,517 --> 01:08:46,748
Are you related to the family
that was here before?

517
01:08:48,055 --> 01:08:49,522
Uh-uh.

518
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:53,257
You look a lot like them.
The kid had the same...

519
01:08:54,261 --> 01:08:55,922
Harry, knock it off!

520
01:09:05,505 --> 01:09:08,997
Have you had any trouble
with vandals or trespassers?

521
01:09:09,076 --> 01:09:10,907
What's that supposed to mean?

522
01:09:10,978 --> 01:09:14,004
Well... you've got a door

523
01:09:14,081 --> 01:09:17,050
that was broken outward
from the inside.

524
01:09:18,785 --> 01:09:22,482
Burglars break in, and you've got
a front door that's broken out.

525
01:09:23,457 --> 01:09:25,152
Let me tell you something...

526
01:09:25,225 --> 01:09:27,989
somebody broke into my house,
they heard me coming,

527
01:09:28,061 --> 01:09:29,619
and they took off.

528
01:09:30,631 --> 01:09:32,758
Okay. Then who broke
the basement door?

529
01:09:33,934 --> 01:09:37,062
Maybe they came in
through the cellar...

530
01:09:37,137 --> 01:09:38,627
then ran out the front door.

531
01:09:38,705 --> 01:09:41,401
No. I checked all the windows
down there. None broken.

532
01:09:41,475 --> 01:09:44,740
You think it was faster
to break it down than to open it?

533
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,184
There'll be a tighter watch
on your house.

534
01:09:55,756 --> 01:09:58,247
You call us
if anything happens, okay?

535
01:09:58,859 --> 01:10:00,019
Uh-huh.

536
01:10:00,093 --> 01:10:01,253
Good night.

537
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:04,390
Night.

538
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:05,448
Why is it all going wrong?

539
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:09,228
We have to do something.

540
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,984
Jody says everything's
gonna get better.

541
01:11:36,056 --> 01:11:38,752
What does Jody look like?

542
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:45,626
I mean... is Jody big
or thin or fat or...

543
01:11:45,699 --> 01:11:47,792
She's nice.

544
01:11:49,436 --> 01:11:53,304
- She tells me things, too.
- Like what does she tell you?

545
01:11:53,373 --> 01:11:57,366
She tells me about the little boy
who used to live in my room.

546
01:11:57,444 --> 01:11:59,969
He got hurt, and he died.

547
01:12:01,448 --> 01:12:03,245
And what else
does Jody tell you?

548
01:12:03,316 --> 01:12:06,513
She says she wants me
to live here forever and ever

549
01:12:06,586 --> 01:12:09,248
so we can all play together.

550
01:12:31,344 --> 01:12:34,905
Bye, sweeties.
Be home by 3:30, okay?

551
01:12:35,916 --> 01:12:37,281
Be careful.

552
01:13:52,392 --> 01:13:53,950
Oh, answer.

553
01:14:04,704 --> 01:14:06,569
Please answer.

554
01:14:22,222 --> 01:14:23,587
Hello?

555
01:14:23,657 --> 01:14:28,094
Father, this is Kathy Lutz,
and I have to talk to you!

556
01:14:31,164 --> 01:14:32,961
Listen to what I'm telling you...

557
01:14:34,301 --> 01:14:35,791
Father?

558
01:14:56,423 --> 01:14:58,857
O Lord, hear my prayer...

559
01:14:59,926 --> 01:15:02,087
and hasten to answer me.

560
01:15:45,338 --> 01:15:46,965
Hello.

561
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:50,635
Everybody wanted to come over
to welcome you to the neighborhood.

562
01:15:52,779 --> 01:15:54,303
It's all right, isn't it?

563
01:15:58,618 --> 01:15:59,983
Just a minute, please.

564
01:16:03,957 --> 01:16:05,151
Hello?

565
01:16:58,945 --> 01:17:01,880
Thanks for coming.
I thought I might be stood up.

566
01:17:01,948 --> 01:17:05,315
Don't give me any crap.
I don't have time for it.

567
01:17:05,385 --> 01:17:09,378
Relax, will ya?
I just wanna buy you a drink.

568
01:17:09,456 --> 01:17:11,754
- Couple of beers, please?
- Gotcha.

569
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:20,793
Are you all right?
I mean, you look terrible.

570
01:17:20,867 --> 01:17:22,198
Here you are, pal.

571
01:17:23,303 --> 01:17:27,000
Jesus, I'm sorry.
You look just like that kid.

572
01:17:27,073 --> 01:17:30,509
He was sitting right in that seat
when he was arrested.

573
01:17:30,577 --> 01:17:32,135
What are you talking about?

574
01:17:32,212 --> 01:17:34,578
The kid last year
that killed his family.

575
01:17:34,647 --> 01:17:38,413
The house down by the river?
You're the spittin' image.

576
01:17:38,485 --> 01:17:41,943
- So?
- So, I'll bring you another brew.

577
01:17:42,856 --> 01:17:43,982
No offense.

578
01:17:46,326 --> 01:17:48,556
I gotta get out of here.
I'll talk to you later.

579
01:17:48,628 --> 01:17:51,028
No, now.
We gotta talk now.

580
01:17:51,097 --> 01:17:52,758
The business is falling apart.

581
01:17:52,832 --> 01:17:55,027
People are calling.
Bills have to be paid.

582
01:17:55,101 --> 01:17:57,501
I know you're busy unpacking,
but life goes on.

583
01:17:57,570 --> 01:18:00,061
I'm warning you,
I don't have the patience.

584
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:02,574
You're warning me.
Give me a break. Talk to me!

585
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:10,243
I knew this would happen.
I told you you were taking on too much.

586
01:18:10,316 --> 01:18:12,716
- Just drop it!
- You marry a dame with three kids,

587
01:18:12,786 --> 01:18:15,311
you buy a big house
with mortgages up to your ass,

588
01:18:15,388 --> 01:18:19,324
you change your religion,
and you forget about business.

589
01:18:26,933 --> 01:18:30,061
Okay... now can we talk?

590
01:18:33,406 --> 01:18:34,964
Christ, man, I'm sorry.

591
01:18:35,041 --> 01:18:37,032
I don't know
what I was thinking.

592
01:18:37,644 --> 01:18:40,010
Okay. Come on.

593
01:18:41,181 --> 01:18:45,550
Jesus loves me,
this I know

594
01:18:45,618 --> 01:18:50,180
For the Bible tells me so

595
01:18:50,256 --> 01:18:55,057
Little ones to Him belong

596
01:18:55,128 --> 01:18:59,895
They are weak,
but He is strong

597
01:18:59,966 --> 01:19:04,835
Yes, Jesus loves me

598
01:19:12,879 --> 01:19:14,870
The Bible...

599
01:19:16,816 --> 01:19:18,443
Who you singing to, princess?

600
01:19:18,518 --> 01:19:20,748
You scared Jody.

601
01:19:21,387 --> 01:19:22,786
Jody?

602
01:19:23,756 --> 01:19:25,747
Look, there's no one here, see?

603
01:19:25,825 --> 01:19:27,349
You scared her.

604
01:19:27,427 --> 01:19:29,418
She went out the window.

605
01:19:30,463 --> 01:19:32,055
She went out the window?

606
01:19:32,131 --> 01:19:35,692
I'd better check and make sure
she's not still there.

607
01:19:48,181 --> 01:19:50,581
The house is doing things.

608
01:19:50,650 --> 01:19:53,141
I mean, windows open
by themselves.

609
01:19:54,354 --> 01:19:57,118
Rooms full of flies
at the wrong time of year.

610
01:19:57,190 --> 01:20:00,353
You saw what happened
to Greg's hand.

611
01:20:00,426 --> 01:20:02,257
It's crazy.

612
01:20:04,030 --> 01:20:06,931
Last night the front door
was ripped off its hinges

613
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,592
from the inside.

614
01:20:09,936 --> 01:20:12,769
Of course!
It's right here, it's history.

615
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:14,898
John Ketchum.

616
01:20:14,974 --> 01:20:17,374
- So?
- Listen.

617
01:20:17,443 --> 01:20:20,844
They ran him out of Salem
for being a witch.

618
01:20:22,749 --> 01:20:25,274
And he built his house
exactly where you're living.

619
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:29,984
You're living on
some sort of special ground...

620
01:20:31,257 --> 01:20:37,218
devil worship...
death... sacrifice.

621
01:20:40,133 --> 01:20:42,294
There's one simple rule...

622
01:20:43,202 --> 01:20:45,534
Energy cannot be
created or destroyed.

623
01:20:45,605 --> 01:20:47,072
It can only change forms.

624
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:49,108
Carolyn, will you get a grip
on yourself?

625
01:20:49,175 --> 01:20:51,302
You sound like
some kind of psycho weirdo!

626
01:20:51,377 --> 01:20:56,178
Come on, Jeffrey. Don't be
such a hard-core rationalist.

627
01:20:56,249 --> 01:20:59,275
Everything in life
cannot be explained by a slide rule.

628
01:20:59,352 --> 01:21:01,786
Thank you very much
for your cosmic views.

629
01:21:01,854 --> 01:21:03,446
Now do me a favor, shut up!

630
01:21:09,696 --> 01:21:12,927
Can I make
a rational suggestion, please?

631
01:21:15,068 --> 01:21:18,265
Sure, man. Anything.

632
01:21:20,206 --> 01:21:23,039
Go home, get cleaned up...

633
01:21:23,109 --> 01:21:25,737
take Kathy out to dinner.

634
01:21:25,812 --> 01:21:27,871
Carolyn and I
will baby-sit the kids.

635
01:21:28,781 --> 01:21:31,773
You gotta get away from it,
even for a couple of hours,

636
01:21:31,851 --> 01:21:36,049
and when you get back...
we'll add it all up.

637
01:21:36,122 --> 01:21:37,851
We'll talk this thing through.

638
01:21:44,831 --> 01:21:45,991
Okay.

639
01:21:47,233 --> 01:21:48,564
Let's go home.

640
01:22:03,216 --> 01:22:04,979
I'll go in and talk to Kathy,

641
01:22:05,051 --> 01:22:07,383
and you all come in
in a couple of minutes.

642
01:22:18,931 --> 01:22:20,899
He told us to wait out here.

643
01:22:20,967 --> 01:22:22,696
Jeff...

644
01:22:23,936 --> 01:22:25,563
I gotta see it for myself.

645
01:22:25,638 --> 01:22:28,129
I thought that place
gave you the creeps.

646
01:22:32,812 --> 01:22:34,803
Are those vibes ever strong.

647
01:22:36,549 --> 01:22:38,073
It really pulls on you.

648
01:22:40,219 --> 01:22:43,416
I gotta see the basement.
That's where it's coming from.

649
01:22:43,489 --> 01:22:46,287
I'm very sensitive
about these things.

650
01:22:48,094 --> 01:22:49,652
And I know about them.

651
01:22:53,499 --> 01:22:55,899
Come on,
knock it off, will you?

652
01:22:58,504 --> 01:23:00,836
What I saw was not a cat.

653
01:23:03,710 --> 01:23:05,337
It could've climbed up the ivy.

654
01:23:05,411 --> 01:23:07,902
It's all over the side
of the damn house.

655
01:23:10,917 --> 01:23:13,385
I don't have
all the answers yet.

656
01:23:14,053 --> 01:23:16,681
We gotta get
some perspective on this thing.

657
01:23:19,058 --> 01:23:21,458
Come on,
let's take Jeff's offer.

658
01:23:22,395 --> 01:23:23,760
Put yourself together.

659
01:23:24,764 --> 01:23:27,392
Let's get the hell away from it
for a couple of hours.

660
01:23:29,035 --> 01:23:30,366
We'll get dressed...

661
01:23:32,004 --> 01:23:34,165
I just gotta check
the fire first.

662
01:23:44,450 --> 01:23:46,441
Demons are smart.

663
01:23:46,886 --> 01:23:49,116
They're not just monsters. They...

664
01:23:51,124 --> 01:23:54,389
They think
just like you and I do.

665
01:23:55,061 --> 01:23:58,792
Just in reverse.
It's a closed system.

666
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:02,832
Now you're beginning
to give me the creeps.

667
01:24:06,405 --> 01:24:09,636
There was a tribe of Indians
called the Shinnecocks,

668
01:24:09,709 --> 01:24:13,236
and they used this land
as a sort of exposure pen.

669
01:24:16,315 --> 01:24:19,682
They put all the crazy people here
and left them here to die.

670
01:24:22,822 --> 01:24:25,382
- My God!
- That's where it is.

671
01:24:25,458 --> 01:24:27,289
What the hell
are you talking about?

672
01:24:29,595 --> 01:24:31,927
There are people buried here.

673
01:24:37,436 --> 01:24:40,769
Easy. Easy.

674
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:42,501
Easy, there.

675
01:24:59,458 --> 01:25:00,925
What the hell are you doing?

676
01:25:03,329 --> 01:25:06,423
- What is the matter with you?
- Don't you understand?

677
01:25:06,499 --> 01:25:09,400
It has to be done.
That is where the room is.

678
01:25:09,468 --> 01:25:11,026
What are you doing
to my house?

679
01:25:11,103 --> 01:25:13,094
I'm sorry.
I don't know what got into her.

680
01:25:13,172 --> 01:25:15,470
I'm trying to tell him
that's where it is.

681
01:25:27,453 --> 01:25:29,045
She's right.

682
01:25:30,122 --> 01:25:32,181
There is something here.

683
01:25:36,529 --> 01:25:37,689
Give me that.

684
01:26:02,388 --> 01:26:03,878
What's going on?

685
01:26:05,224 --> 01:26:06,384
Have you all gone mad?

686
01:26:31,751 --> 01:26:35,084
They... come
and go through here.

687
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:49,894
Find the well.

688
01:26:51,771 --> 01:26:56,208
It's the passage...
to hell!

689
01:27:01,547 --> 01:27:03,412
Cover it!

690
01:27:46,993 --> 01:27:48,153
Hello?

691
01:28:06,445 --> 01:28:08,242
George, you heard that voice.

692
01:28:09,248 --> 01:28:11,375
You know whose voice that was.

693
01:28:13,152 --> 01:28:15,586
You heard it.
I know you heard it!

694
01:28:22,061 --> 01:28:25,394
We have to do something, George.

695
01:28:25,464 --> 01:28:27,796
We have to do something now.

696
01:29:12,511 --> 01:29:14,979
Peace to this house
and all who enter here.

697
01:29:15,047 --> 01:29:18,881
Forgive us our sins
and save us from all illness.

698
01:29:18,951 --> 01:29:21,715
Grant this
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

699
01:29:31,130 --> 01:29:32,825
What is going on here?

700
01:29:37,269 --> 01:29:38,896
Weird people.

701
01:29:55,321 --> 01:29:57,516
Bless this house
and all who enter here.

702
01:29:57,590 --> 01:29:59,683
Bless this house...

703
01:30:00,993 --> 01:30:02,961
What's happening?

704
01:30:16,075 --> 01:30:17,508
Don't touch me!

705
01:30:17,576 --> 01:30:20,511
Leave me alone, please.

706
01:30:23,415 --> 01:30:24,973
Please.

707
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:43,461
Father, since I've come back
from Vietnam,

708
01:30:43,536 --> 01:30:46,027
you've had
a tremendous influence in my life.

709
01:30:47,406 --> 01:30:50,705
I look up to you.
I respect you, I admire you.

710
01:30:50,776 --> 01:30:52,368
And what is your point?

711
01:30:54,146 --> 01:30:58,173
I believe that...
that I know about fear.

712
01:30:58,250 --> 01:31:01,742
I've seen it.
I've experienced it.

713
01:31:03,856 --> 01:31:07,451
I wish you'd make your point.
I've got a lot of things to do.

714
01:31:07,526 --> 01:31:11,690
My point is I believe we create
our own demons in our own minds.

715
01:31:16,168 --> 01:31:17,328
I'm sorry, Father.

716
01:31:40,359 --> 01:31:44,693
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

717
01:31:51,003 --> 01:31:52,493
Let us pray.

718
01:32:05,884 --> 01:32:07,749
Father...

719
01:32:09,588 --> 01:32:15,185
by the power of Your spirit...
You have filled the hearts...

720
01:32:16,562 --> 01:32:18,291
of Your faithful people...

721
01:32:19,632 --> 01:32:24,331
with gifts of love...
for one another.

722
01:32:26,605 --> 01:32:29,870
Hear the prayers that we offer
for our relatives and friends.

723
01:32:31,844 --> 01:32:33,539
Give them health.

724
01:32:34,413 --> 01:32:38,406
Give them health
of mind and body that...

725
01:32:42,087 --> 01:32:43,987
Give them health
of mind and body

726
01:32:44,056 --> 01:32:46,581
that they may do Your will
with perfect love.

727
01:32:49,228 --> 01:32:51,594
Give them health
of mind and body

728
01:32:51,664 --> 01:32:54,758
that they may do Your will
with perfect love!

729
01:32:54,833 --> 01:32:58,200
We ask this through
our Lord, Jesus Christ, Your Son!

730
01:33:00,172 --> 01:33:02,606
Give them strength
of mind and body!

731
01:33:02,675 --> 01:33:04,973
Oh, Lord...

732
01:33:05,044 --> 01:33:07,012
I beg Thee!

733
01:33:07,079 --> 01:33:08,239
Give them strength

734
01:33:08,314 --> 01:33:13,274
in the name of our Lord,
Jesus Christ, Your Son!

735
01:33:13,352 --> 01:33:14,876
Oh, Lord!

736
01:33:16,622 --> 01:33:18,783
Oh, Jesus Christ!

737
01:33:32,037 --> 01:33:33,470
Richard.

738
01:33:36,642 --> 01:33:38,269
What is it, Father?

739
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:43,245
I can't see.

740
01:33:50,055 --> 01:33:51,784
I'm blind.

741
01:35:13,071 --> 01:35:15,096
What do you want from us?

742
01:35:18,977 --> 01:35:21,309
Goddammit!
This is my house!

743
01:36:18,770 --> 01:36:20,965
No!

744
01:37:05,183 --> 01:37:06,878
Oh, no.

745
01:37:11,757 --> 01:37:13,691
I'm coming apart!

746
01:37:13,759 --> 01:37:17,456
Oh, Mother of God,
I'm coming apart!

747
01:37:25,571 --> 01:37:27,129
What happened?

748
01:37:28,106 --> 01:37:30,802
I was just dreaming.

749
01:37:30,876 --> 01:37:32,707
I'm sorry if I woke you.

750
01:37:32,778 --> 01:37:35,770
Honey, are you okay?

751
01:37:35,847 --> 01:37:37,610
Oh, sure.

752
01:37:37,683 --> 01:37:39,082
Are you sure?

753
01:37:44,623 --> 01:37:47,387
Oh, my God,
what happened to your foot?

754
01:37:50,462 --> 01:37:52,430
Look.

755
01:37:52,497 --> 01:37:55,694
Nothing.
I just tripped.

756
01:37:59,338 --> 01:38:03,138
- It looks like teeth marks.
- Will you stop nagging at me?

757
01:38:04,142 --> 01:38:06,337
It's always so cold in here.

758
01:38:09,781 --> 01:38:11,772
Let's get out of here, huh?

759
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:14,250
Let's just
pack up our stuff and go.

760
01:38:17,456 --> 01:38:20,857
Would you please leave that
damn fire alone and listen to me?

761
01:38:20,926 --> 01:38:22,723
I'm not going anywhere!

762
01:38:22,794 --> 01:38:25,820
You're the one that wanted a house.
This is it, so just shut up!

763
01:38:26,932 --> 01:38:28,763
You bastard!

764
01:39:05,068 --> 01:39:07,764
Excuse me. Somebody told me
you could tell me where...

765
01:39:07,837 --> 01:39:09,099
Excuse me.

766
01:39:10,207 --> 01:39:12,107
Someone told me that...

767
01:39:12,175 --> 01:39:15,406
I'm Kathy Lutz, and I'm
looking for Father Delaney.

768
01:39:17,714 --> 01:39:19,443
Hi, I'm Father Bolen.

769
01:39:20,417 --> 01:39:22,783
I believe the Father
has gone on vacation.

770
01:39:22,852 --> 01:39:24,615
He's been very overworked...

771
01:39:24,688 --> 01:39:28,146
I must speak to Father Delaney.
I simply must.

772
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:33,161
You don't understand.
He's more than a priest to me.

773
01:39:33,230 --> 01:39:35,824
He's like a friend of mine.

774
01:39:35,899 --> 01:39:38,561
He's helped me through
some very difficult times,

775
01:39:38,635 --> 01:39:40,694
and I have to
talk to him now.

776
01:39:43,073 --> 01:39:45,303
It's out of my hands.

777
01:41:12,962 --> 01:41:14,452
Hello, Father.

778
01:41:16,633 --> 01:41:18,396
How are you feeling today?

779
01:41:28,978 --> 01:41:32,072
I brought you some mail.
Would you like me to read it?

780
01:41:38,822 --> 01:41:41,416
I notice there's one here
from a former patient.

781
01:41:41,491 --> 01:41:42,981
Would you like to hear it?

782
01:41:53,470 --> 01:41:55,995
It certainly is beautiful here.

783
01:41:59,676 --> 01:42:02,270
Why don't I arrange
so we can have our lunch here?

784
01:42:02,345 --> 01:42:04,210
Would you like that, Father?

785
01:42:43,620 --> 01:42:46,646
Excuse me, Father.
Can I have a word with you?

786
01:42:48,825 --> 01:42:52,226
Of course, Sergeant.
What can I do for you?

787
01:42:52,295 --> 01:42:56,561
Well...
I don't really know exactly.

788
01:42:56,633 --> 01:43:00,194
It may be just a wild-goose chase,
but I'm the curious type.

789
01:43:00,270 --> 01:43:02,738
Like the man says,
it goes with the territory.

790
01:43:02,806 --> 01:43:04,740
I have a great deal
of work to do.

791
01:43:04,808 --> 01:43:07,003
Could you
make your point, please?

792
01:43:07,076 --> 01:43:09,408
What's happening
to Father Delaney?

793
01:43:10,380 --> 01:43:13,440
He's an old friend,
and I can't get the story right.

794
01:43:13,516 --> 01:43:15,575
There's no "story" to get right.

795
01:43:18,121 --> 01:43:20,453
Maybe I am
just chasing shadows.

796
01:43:21,324 --> 01:43:23,053
If you could excuse me, please.

797
01:43:55,158 --> 01:43:57,490
I think this has
all the good stuff.

798
01:43:57,560 --> 01:43:59,391
I mean the major coverage.

799
01:43:59,462 --> 01:44:01,521
If there's anything else
you want to see,

800
01:44:01,598 --> 01:44:04,260
- I'll go and get it.
- No, I think this should be fine.

801
01:44:04,334 --> 01:44:08,134
This is the November 14th issue,
the day after the murders.

802
01:44:08,204 --> 01:44:10,138
You turn that crank...

803
01:44:10,206 --> 01:44:11,867
- That one there?
- Right there.

804
01:44:11,941 --> 01:44:15,035
It advances the film.
Each frame is a whole page.

805
01:44:15,111 --> 01:44:18,171
To get it in focus,
you just turn this knob right here.

806
01:44:18,248 --> 01:44:20,375
- I've got it.
- You all set now?

807
01:44:20,450 --> 01:44:21,474
- I'm fine.
- Good.

808
01:44:47,310 --> 01:44:50,245
Oh, my God, George.

809
01:47:04,180 --> 01:47:08,742
Matt! Greg! Matt!

810
01:48:07,477 --> 01:48:08,808
Amy!

811
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:12,432
Don't hurt my babies.

812
01:49:15,311 --> 01:49:16,471
Jesus.

813
01:49:24,687 --> 01:49:27,622
I saw your picture
in the newspaper.

814
01:49:33,229 --> 01:49:35,595
Kathy, I wouldn't hurt you.

815
01:50:09,665 --> 01:50:11,997
Get going!
Now! Get going!

816
01:50:19,809 --> 01:50:20,935
Hold on!

817
01:50:28,351 --> 01:50:29,978
Go!

818
01:50:43,065 --> 01:50:45,033
Here, let me try.

819
01:50:45,101 --> 01:50:47,729
- I got it.
- I can't open it!

820
01:50:54,377 --> 01:50:55,537
Go! Go!

821
01:50:57,213 --> 01:50:58,544
Mom!

822
01:51:16,499 --> 01:51:18,194
The keys...

823
01:51:18,267 --> 01:51:21,202
Oh, God! Where are the keys?

824
01:51:21,270 --> 01:51:22,669
What? Wait a minute.

825
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:27,800
I can't find them.

826
01:51:33,950 --> 01:51:35,679
I want Harry!

827
01:51:36,752 --> 01:51:38,811
- Please, George, drive.
- Mom.

828
01:52:03,913 --> 01:52:07,815
George, no! No!

829
01:52:26,102 --> 01:52:28,297
Harry! Come on, boy!

830
01:52:51,093 --> 01:52:52,560
Harry, come on!

831
01:53:39,975 --> 01:53:41,135
No, it's me!

832
01:53:46,749 --> 01:53:48,307
Harry, no!

833
01:53:58,727 --> 01:54:00,820
Pull! Pull!

834
01:54:07,069 --> 01:54:09,128
Harry, pull!

835
01:54:23,853 --> 01:54:25,286
Good boy.

836
01:54:49,411 --> 01:54:50,901
Come on, boy!

837
01:55:28,717 --> 01:55:32,084
Thank God.
Oh, thank God.
