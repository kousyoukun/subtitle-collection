1
00:03:26,013 --> 00:03:28,413
Jesus Christ!
It gets worse all the time!

2
00:03:28,482 --> 00:03:30,814
Your job
doesn't get any better.

3
00:03:31,118 --> 00:03:33,712
All shot in their beds,
execution style.

4
00:03:34,321 --> 00:03:36,118
Only the mother
shot in the head.

5
00:03:37,858 --> 00:03:41,055
What time you make it?
Give me a ballpark guess.

6
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,586
3:00... 3:15.

7
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:45,964
And that's pretty close.

8
00:03:47,034 --> 00:03:48,023
Thanks.

9
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,498
How long
have you been waiting?

10
00:04:51,565 --> 00:04:53,795
- Half an hour.
- Just a couple of minutes.

11
00:04:54,902 --> 00:04:57,370
Over there,
that's the little gardening hut.

12
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,739
- You mean that's included?
- Sure.

13
00:05:00,808 --> 00:05:02,867
It could be a guesthouse
with a little fixing up.

14
00:05:02,943 --> 00:05:05,537
- A guesthouse?
- Sure.

15
00:05:05,612 --> 00:05:08,479
Come on.
Right up here.

16
00:05:10,551 --> 00:05:13,281
See how much property you have?
Isn't that lovely?

17
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:18,853
Be careful. Don't trip.

18
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:23,658
You'll see what a beauty this is.

19
00:05:29,603 --> 00:05:32,128
There's nothing like it
on the market.

20
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,901
Not at this price.

21
00:05:37,311 --> 00:05:39,677
- Come in.
- Thank you.

22
00:05:39,746 --> 00:05:41,236
Impressive, isn't it?

23
00:05:42,249 --> 00:05:44,217
I mean,
that's what I call charming.

24
00:05:44,284 --> 00:05:47,344
- I'll show you the living room.
- Thank you.

25
00:05:48,822 --> 00:05:53,418
That's a wood-burning fireplace.
It'll be nice on cold nights.

26
00:05:58,365 --> 00:06:02,267
That's the sun porch.
Nice, isn't it?

27
00:06:02,336 --> 00:06:05,328
- George, I don't think...
- Be cool.

28
00:06:05,405 --> 00:06:09,307
- Would you like to see the kitchen?
- Yes, thank you.

29
00:06:09,376 --> 00:06:10,968
This is the kitchen.

30
00:06:11,044 --> 00:06:13,877
Nice and spacious, isn't it?
Really big.

31
00:06:13,947 --> 00:06:16,848
Has all the original hardware,
and everything works.

32
00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:20,652
This your first house?

33
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:24,389
We just got married.

34
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,325
Shall we look at the upstairs?

35
00:06:28,395 --> 00:06:32,422
I like to refer to this as a fixer-upper
that can be fun.

36
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,097
We'll start with this.

37
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,507
This is an extra room.

38
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,817
This is the bathroom
connecting with the next bedroom.

39
00:07:00,894 --> 00:07:03,021
This is the second bedroom.

40
00:07:04,097 --> 00:07:06,463
There's a nice view
of the river from here.

41
00:07:08,902 --> 00:07:12,429
If you're planning on a big family,
there are three full bedrooms.

42
00:07:12,506 --> 00:07:14,440
We already have a family.

43
00:07:14,508 --> 00:07:16,601
Two boys and a girl.
Great kids.

44
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,411
You are so bad.

45
00:07:22,482 --> 00:07:24,177
- What?
- Cut it out.

46
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,988
Next is the master bedroom.

47
00:07:50,143 --> 00:07:51,303
I love it.

48
00:07:52,512 --> 00:07:54,446
There's just one more floor.

49
00:07:58,251 --> 00:07:59,582
See anything you like...

50
00:08:06,326 --> 00:08:08,055
we can include it in the price.

51
00:08:08,128 --> 00:08:09,618
- Really?
- Sure.

52
00:08:17,938 --> 00:08:21,738
This can be another bedroom...
or a playroom, whichever you prefer.

53
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:33,245
We'll wander around on our own again
now that we got the layout.

54
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,151
We can meet you downstairs.

55
00:08:36,556 --> 00:08:37,716
How would that be?

56
00:08:38,592 --> 00:08:41,891
I'll be in the kitchen.
Take your time.

57
00:08:41,962 --> 00:08:43,862
We won't be long.

58
00:08:48,502 --> 00:08:51,562
- What do you think?
- I love it.

59
00:08:54,207 --> 00:08:57,802
Honey... $80,000?

60
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:04,342
I mean...
it might as well be $800,000.

61
00:09:08,622 --> 00:09:09,850
Listen...

62
00:09:11,925 --> 00:09:16,385
The house is worth
$120,000 easy.

63
00:09:17,998 --> 00:09:22,025
If I move my office into that cottage
out back, that'll save that rent.

64
00:09:22,102 --> 00:09:23,399
And the boathouse...

65
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,030
means I won't have to shell out
for mooring charges,

66
00:09:26,106 --> 00:09:27,869
which they're raising,
by the way.

67
00:09:27,941 --> 00:09:29,806
You didn't tell me that.

68
00:09:29,876 --> 00:09:32,003
There was nothing
to be done about it.

69
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:35,247
I just wish that...

70
00:09:35,315 --> 00:09:37,306
all those people
hadn't died here.

71
00:09:40,053 --> 00:09:43,955
A guy kills his whole family?
Doesn't that bother you?

72
00:09:44,024 --> 00:09:48,154
Sure, but...
houses don't have memories.

73
00:09:50,797 --> 00:09:51,957
I don't know.

74
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:55,390
I do. The house
wouldn't even be for sale,

75
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,437
and if it was,
we couldn't afford it

76
00:09:57,504 --> 00:10:01,167
if we had...
tuna casseroles for a year.

77
00:10:03,276 --> 00:10:06,074
You're gonna be very happy.
It's a wonderful house.

78
00:10:06,713 --> 00:10:08,544
I'm sure they'll accept your offer.

79
00:10:08,615 --> 00:10:11,413
Don't worry about a thing.
I'll handle the details.

80
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,646
Just go on
and get ready to move.

81
00:11:14,314 --> 00:11:16,441
They're not getting
too close to the river?

82
00:11:16,516 --> 00:11:18,108
Uh-uh.

83
00:11:18,185 --> 00:11:20,551
Sounds like a regular daddy
I hear over there.

84
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:25,284
I might feel like one if that's what they
started calling me instead of George.

85
00:11:25,358 --> 00:11:29,294
Which I admit is better than that
Mr. Lutz crap they were giving me.

86
00:11:34,301 --> 00:11:36,292
What do you
want to do with this?

87
00:11:37,938 --> 00:11:41,032
Put it in the living room
on that wall beside the bookshelf,

88
00:11:41,107 --> 00:11:43,667
and the light will come through...
it'll look beautiful.

89
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:46,438
You got it.

90
00:11:58,191 --> 00:12:00,056
Voilà!

91
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,155
Aw, shit. Come on.

92
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,842
I'm tired of
this damn sticky paper.

93
00:12:19,913 --> 00:12:23,508
I wish I'd listened to my mother
and gotten the kind that you tack down.

94
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,175
Nobody likes a quitter.

95
00:12:26,553 --> 00:12:27,713
But I got an idea.

96
00:12:30,457 --> 00:12:33,017
Get a couple of beers
and go outside and play?

97
00:12:35,195 --> 00:12:37,561
What are those monsters up to?

98
00:12:52,412 --> 00:12:53,572
Hello?

99
00:12:54,381 --> 00:12:55,848
Anybody home?

100
00:12:57,217 --> 00:12:58,479
Hello?

101
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,587
George?

102
00:13:07,594 --> 00:13:08,754
Kathy?

103
00:13:09,362 --> 00:13:10,659
Anybody home?

104
00:13:18,638 --> 00:13:19,866
Hello?

105
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:27,730
God's peace in this house.

106
00:16:47,514 --> 00:16:49,243
<i>Get out. </i>

107
00:16:57,023 --> 00:16:58,615
<i>Get out!</i>

108
00:17:55,048 --> 00:17:56,743
Amy?

109
00:17:56,816 --> 00:17:58,943
Honey, dinner's ready.

110
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:26,711
- I'll get her.
- I've got her.

111
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:28,212
You and the boys start.

112
00:18:28,281 --> 00:18:30,806
I'll take her upstairs
and put her to bed.

113
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,622
She wasn't outside!

114
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,488
Where was she?

115
00:18:42,562 --> 00:18:45,895
Be getting in there
and eat your hot dogs.

116
00:19:09,355 --> 00:19:10,947
- Hello?
- Hell...

117
00:19:11,991 --> 00:19:13,151
Hello, Kathy?

118
00:19:17,497 --> 00:19:19,192
Can you hear me?

119
00:19:23,736 --> 00:19:25,567
Father Delaney.
There's something very import...

120
00:19:27,306 --> 00:19:28,671
Hello? Hello?

121
00:20:10,717 --> 00:20:12,685
- Who was that?
- On the phone?

122
00:20:12,752 --> 00:20:14,242
Yeah.

123
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,414
Just a bunch of static,
a bad connection or something.

124
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:20,186
I think Ma Bell's
gone wacko again.

125
00:20:22,862 --> 00:20:27,526
Probably discover it was a collect call
from Japan when the bill comes.

126
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,433
Did you make sure that
Amy's got her doll with her?

127
00:20:31,504 --> 00:20:33,165
Yeah. She's sleeping with it.

128
00:20:34,073 --> 00:20:35,233
You hungry, honey?

129
00:20:36,743 --> 00:20:40,907
You don't want one of those charbroiled
hot dogs I did especially for you?

130
00:20:43,015 --> 00:20:44,482
No, I'm not hungry.

131
00:20:49,555 --> 00:20:51,682
Damn, it's cold in here.

132
00:20:52,325 --> 00:20:55,988
It felt cold a bit earlier,
but I think I've warmed up now.

133
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:00,724
It says 72.
It feels like 32.

134
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:03,193
Do you know
what I think it is?

135
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:05,794
There's a draft that
comes up from the basement

136
00:21:05,872 --> 00:21:07,464
through that door down there.

137
00:21:11,444 --> 00:21:13,844
This house is supposed to be
well insulated.

138
00:21:13,913 --> 00:21:16,245
They'll nickel-and-dime you
to death.

139
00:22:09,435 --> 00:22:10,595
Matt?

140
00:22:11,404 --> 00:22:13,668
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

141
00:22:14,674 --> 00:22:17,700
- Did you hurt yourself?
- No.

142
00:22:17,777 --> 00:22:19,267
Those stairs are tricky.

143
00:22:19,345 --> 00:22:22,337
Come on.
I'll take you upstairs.

144
00:22:23,015 --> 00:22:25,074
We'll check
this all out tomorrow.

145
00:23:09,829 --> 00:23:12,161
I'm sorry, baby.
I didn't mean to scare you.

146
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,099
I look at you all the time.

147
00:23:17,503 --> 00:23:19,027
I can't get used to you.

148
00:23:23,709 --> 00:23:24,869
Who loves you?

149
00:23:28,547 --> 00:23:29,707
I'm lucky.

150
00:23:31,017 --> 00:23:34,817
- Come here.
- I just wanted to clean up first.

151
00:23:46,265 --> 00:23:48,426
I love the way
you smell right now.

152
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:00,939
I love you.

153
00:24:02,515 --> 00:24:03,777
I love you back.

154
00:24:12,391 --> 00:24:16,191
You make me feel like a kid
in the back seat of a car.

155
00:24:24,503 --> 00:24:28,166
I want us to work.
I want to be the best.

156
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,504
I don't want you
to have any regrets.

157
00:24:32,078 --> 00:24:33,568
I love you, Kathy.

158
00:25:31,337 --> 00:25:33,498
I want to go home.

159
00:25:35,241 --> 00:25:37,732
Mommy, I want to go home.

160
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:39,778
What's this trouble?

161
00:25:39,845 --> 00:25:41,870
Come on, back to bed.

162
00:25:43,249 --> 00:25:45,308
This is our home.
Don't you know that?

163
00:25:47,353 --> 00:25:48,513
There we go.

164
00:25:51,524 --> 00:25:53,151
There you go, sweetie.

165
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:55,886
What's the matter,
having mean dreams?

166
00:25:59,465 --> 00:26:00,727
Sleep tight.

167
00:26:41,073 --> 00:26:43,166
It's not so easy, is it?

168
00:26:45,344 --> 00:26:48,142
I guess people
have had to deal with this

169
00:26:48,214 --> 00:26:51,115
ever since Adam and Eve
got kicked out of the Garden.

170
00:26:53,586 --> 00:26:55,417
Just have to learn
to live with it.

171
00:27:00,526 --> 00:27:01,686
Thank you.

172
00:28:56,675 --> 00:28:58,700
You're one hell
of a watchdog, Harry.

173
00:29:02,815 --> 00:29:05,409
Come on, boy.
Come on.

174
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:28,864
What do you say?
Looks okay, huh?

175
00:31:13,479 --> 00:31:14,639
Don't ever do that.

176
00:31:15,881 --> 00:31:18,145
Not to a man
with an ax in his hand.

177
00:31:19,017 --> 00:31:21,008
I thought
I could get a little help.

178
00:31:22,855 --> 00:31:25,619
- Look what you made me do.
- I made you do?

179
00:31:25,691 --> 00:31:29,092
There's a week's worth of groceries
rolling down the walk.

180
00:31:29,161 --> 00:31:33,029
- Wait till I finish this stuff.
- George, finish?

181
00:31:33,098 --> 00:31:36,192
You have got enough wood here
to heat the whole South Shore.

182
00:31:50,048 --> 00:31:51,379
You take this.

183
00:31:52,384 --> 00:31:53,715
I'll get the rest.

184
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,048
I love you.

185
00:32:00,826 --> 00:32:02,817
Broke a bulb.

186
00:32:06,265 --> 00:32:08,733
Who drinks this
fancy kind of tea around here?

187
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:11,929
That's for Aunt Helena.
She's coming by around 2:00.

188
00:32:13,238 --> 00:32:15,934
- Give me a break.
- Come on, be nice.

189
00:32:16,008 --> 00:32:17,737
This is a big event
in my family.

190
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,108
We've always been
a bunch of renters.

191
00:32:20,179 --> 00:32:22,807
This is the first time
anyone's bought a house.

192
00:32:22,881 --> 00:32:25,577
Damn regimental inspection,
and we're not ready.

193
00:33:20,939 --> 00:33:24,397
Sweetie pie, you scared me.
What do you want?

194
00:33:24,476 --> 00:33:26,603
My friend Jody
wants to play upstairs.

195
00:33:26,678 --> 00:33:29,203
Huh, Jody? See?

196
00:33:29,281 --> 00:33:32,079
You and Jody go on up
and enjoy yourself.

197
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:34,675
Does your friend Jody
like sugar cookies, too?

198
00:33:36,488 --> 00:33:38,547
- I don't think so.
- No?

199
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:41,953
Off you go.

200
00:33:58,744 --> 00:34:02,009
<i>This is Kathy Lutz. </i>
<i>Could I speak with Father Delarey?</i>

201
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,775
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lutz.

202
00:34:03,849 --> 00:34:06,317
The Father's not
feeling very well today.

203
00:34:06,385 --> 00:34:07,875
He's asleep right now.

204
00:34:08,787 --> 00:34:11,017
This is Father Bolen.
May I help you?

205
00:34:11,089 --> 00:34:12,579
Father Bolen...

206
00:34:12,658 --> 00:34:15,889
He was supposed to come by
and bless the house yesterday,

207
00:34:15,961 --> 00:34:17,986
but it can wait
till he feels better.

208
00:34:18,063 --> 00:34:19,291
I hope he's not too sick?

209
00:34:19,364 --> 00:34:21,491
I think it's just
one of those flu things.

210
00:34:22,434 --> 00:34:25,631
But, Mrs. Lutz, the Father
was at your house yesterday.

211
00:34:25,704 --> 00:34:27,934
We were expecting him,
but he never showed up.

212
00:34:28,006 --> 00:34:30,770
I know he left
to go there.

213
00:34:30,842 --> 00:34:33,003
<i>He didn’t come. </i>
<i>We waited all day. </i>

214
00:34:33,078 --> 00:34:35,342
Must've been
some kind of mix-up.

215
00:34:35,414 --> 00:34:38,815
<i>No big deal. </i>
<i>Just tell him "hi" and... </i>

216
00:34:38,884 --> 00:34:41,284
and that we hope
he's feeling better.

217
00:34:41,353 --> 00:34:43,821
I sure will.
Thank you for calling.

218
00:35:16,655 --> 00:35:18,088
I'll check Amy's bathroom.

219
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:23,289
Oh, does it stink!

220
00:35:25,931 --> 00:35:28,263
Mom, it stinks!

221
00:35:41,313 --> 00:35:44,714
Go down and let Aunt Helena in
and don't tell her about this, okay?

222
00:35:44,783 --> 00:35:46,842
Do we have to?
She's always pinching!

223
00:35:46,918 --> 00:35:48,180
- Go now!
- Come on.

224
00:35:48,253 --> 00:35:49,584
Go on!

225
00:35:50,355 --> 00:35:51,583
And be polite.

226
00:35:57,629 --> 00:36:01,087
Well, hello... Matthew!

227
00:36:01,166 --> 00:36:03,134
And Gregory!

228
00:36:03,201 --> 00:36:04,725
And Harry!

229
00:36:04,803 --> 00:36:06,464
Where's your mother, dear?

230
00:36:06,538 --> 00:36:08,403
She said she'd
be down in a minute.

231
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,310
Aunt Helena?

232
00:36:47,379 --> 00:36:49,870
Kathleen! I'm sorry.

233
00:36:49,948 --> 00:36:52,610
I must've set it
too near the edge.

234
00:36:52,684 --> 00:36:55,653
- I have to go.
- I don't understand.

235
00:36:55,721 --> 00:36:57,655
I don't feel well at all.

236
00:36:57,723 --> 00:37:01,386
I bought your favorite tea,
and I'll make you a cup.

237
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,429
I have to go.
I really feel terrible.

238
00:37:04,496 --> 00:37:07,090
- If you rested a while, you'd feel...
- I can't stay!

239
00:37:07,165 --> 00:37:10,157
- Please stay.
- I can't stay!

240
00:37:10,235 --> 00:37:12,999
- I don't feel well!
- If you just rest and...

241
00:37:13,071 --> 00:37:15,699
I can't stay. Forgive me.

242
00:37:15,774 --> 00:37:17,742
George, please make her...

243
00:39:11,256 --> 00:39:13,588
- Aren't you gonna come to bed?
- In a minute.

244
00:39:14,693 --> 00:39:16,024
The fire went out.

245
00:39:17,195 --> 00:39:18,890
Are you still cold?

246
00:39:24,202 --> 00:39:26,670
I hope you're not
coming down with something.

247
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:31,107
I'll be all right.

248
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:34,601
I gotta stay healthy
for your brother's wedding.

249
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,523
Your hair's getting long.

250
00:39:50,896 --> 00:39:53,421
Maybe you should
sleep in tomorrow.

251
00:39:54,799 --> 00:39:56,460
I got work to do.

252
00:39:56,534 --> 00:39:59,935
I don't want to be
up to my ass in boxes forever.

253
00:40:11,416 --> 00:40:12,747
I'm sorry.

254
00:40:15,654 --> 00:40:18,179
I don't know what
the hell's the matter with me.

255
00:40:19,391 --> 00:40:22,622
- Silly, this happens all the time.
- Not to me it doesn't.

256
00:40:23,361 --> 00:40:26,455
Stop pushing. You don't
have to prove anything to me.

257
00:40:43,181 --> 00:40:44,375
Turn out the light.

258
00:40:56,061 --> 00:40:57,221
I love you.

259
00:40:58,196 --> 00:40:59,629
I love you back.

260
00:41:24,689 --> 00:41:26,623
She was shot in the head!

261
00:41:34,733 --> 00:41:36,030
You all right?

262
00:42:04,863 --> 00:42:07,889
- Tell me something, Father.
- What?

263
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,392
Why couldn't this
wait till tomorrow?

264
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:13,928
I don't know. I...

265
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,831
All I know is
I have to get back to that house.

266
00:42:21,346 --> 00:42:24,611
- Are you feeling all right?
- I'm fine. Fine, fine.

267
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:34,788
Father, there's something wrong
with the steering wheel.

268
00:42:38,263 --> 00:42:40,128
I can't move the wheel.

269
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,807
What's wrong with this?

270
00:43:30,615 --> 00:43:32,913
Harry, be quiet!

271
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:35,112
Be quiet!

272
00:44:00,478 --> 00:44:02,105
Will you check this, please?

273
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,444
It's gotta come to 1,500 bucks
for the caterer.

274
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:08,043
- That sucker wants cash.
- Jimmy, will you relax?

275
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:10,610
You've counted it
about a thousand times.

276
00:44:17,195 --> 00:44:19,425
You sure do look terrific.

277
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,633
You're not gonna
start to cry already?

278
00:44:34,646 --> 00:44:36,307
It's just that yesterday,

279
00:44:36,381 --> 00:44:38,849
I was riding you around
on the back of my bike.

280
00:44:39,584 --> 00:44:41,245
And now you're getting married.

281
00:44:42,153 --> 00:44:43,245
I sure am.

282
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:50,584
I'm just real happy for you.
That's all, hon.

283
00:44:58,069 --> 00:45:00,230
Hey, there he is.

284
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:05,476
- George, you look terrible!
- So she keeps telling me.

285
00:45:05,543 --> 00:45:08,034
It's some kind of
flu virus going around.

286
00:45:08,112 --> 00:45:09,807
Amy's got it, too.
It's nothing.

287
00:45:09,881 --> 00:45:12,679
If you're not up to it,
I'd understand.

288
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:14,718
I'm your best man.

289
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,380
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

290
00:45:18,456 --> 00:45:21,857
Mrs. Lutz, am I supposed to
give Amy an aspirin or anything?

291
00:45:21,926 --> 00:45:24,417
Just give her one
before bed, okay?

292
00:45:24,495 --> 00:45:25,484
Okay.

293
00:45:26,497 --> 00:45:29,466
- Are you gonna be okay?
- I don't know.

294
00:45:33,004 --> 00:45:34,369
What's the matter?

295
00:45:35,506 --> 00:45:38,600
- The money.
- What money?

296
00:45:38,676 --> 00:45:40,644
The money for the caterer.
$1,500.

297
00:45:40,712 --> 00:45:42,339
I put it in this pocket.

298
00:45:42,413 --> 00:45:45,439
- It must've fallen out.
- It's not here.

299
00:45:47,285 --> 00:45:48,513
I'll look under here.

300
00:45:50,922 --> 00:45:52,184
Did you check your pants?

301
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,327
Calm down. It can't have
gotten up and walked away.

302
00:45:59,397 --> 00:46:01,160
If you had it here,
it's gotta be here.

303
00:46:01,232 --> 00:46:02,529
What am I gonna do?

304
00:46:03,534 --> 00:46:04,933
I can't believe it!

305
00:46:09,574 --> 00:46:12,042
Will you get those kids
off that horn?

306
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:13,634
Jimmy, George.

307
00:46:14,312 --> 00:46:17,042
We have to go.
We're getting very late.

308
00:46:17,115 --> 00:46:18,446
What am I gonna do?

309
00:46:20,385 --> 00:46:21,977
It's gotta be here someplace.

310
00:46:22,053 --> 00:46:23,611
We'll look when we get home.

311
00:46:23,688 --> 00:46:25,212
What about the caterer?

312
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,527
I'll take care of him.
I'll write him a check.

313
00:46:31,596 --> 00:46:33,154
Sweetie.

314
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:34,927
Okay?

315
00:46:36,434 --> 00:46:37,731
I'll get the kids.

316
00:46:57,622 --> 00:46:59,453
It's freezing in here!

317
00:47:03,127 --> 00:47:05,994
It's time for bed, Amy.
I gotta give you an aspirin.

318
00:47:06,064 --> 00:47:10,125
I don't wanna go to bed.
I wanna play with Jody.

319
00:47:10,201 --> 00:47:12,396
Your mom said I had to
put you to bed early

320
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:14,097
because you've been sick.

321
00:47:14,172 --> 00:47:15,764
Don't smart off to me.

322
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,537
I wasn't sick.
I just didn't like meatloaf.

323
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:21,805
Let's get you
into your pajamas.

324
00:47:42,433 --> 00:47:45,630
Amy, open the door.

325
00:47:52,741 --> 00:47:55,073
I'm in the closet.
Open the door.

326
00:47:59,315 --> 00:48:01,146
Amy, I mean it!

327
00:48:08,257 --> 00:48:11,317
Come to the door!
Open it!

328
00:48:14,063 --> 00:48:17,294
For Christ's sake!
Open the door!

329
00:48:34,316 --> 00:48:36,648
Amy, open the door!

330
00:48:48,764 --> 00:48:51,358
For Christ's sake,
open the door!

331
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:18,319
How are you?

332
00:49:19,361 --> 00:49:21,488
- Are you feeling better?
- Fine.

333
00:49:21,564 --> 00:49:23,259
I want to apologize
for the other day.

334
00:49:23,332 --> 00:49:25,232
- Don't worry.
- I don't know what happened.

335
00:49:25,301 --> 00:49:28,293
I hadn't gone half a block
from your house,

336
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:29,962
and I was violently ill.

337
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:32,064
I think there's a virus
going around.

338
00:49:32,141 --> 00:49:34,939
Father Delaney's got something,
and Amy's got something.

339
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:38,036
And I don't know
what's the matter with George.

340
00:49:39,481 --> 00:49:42,314
I'll talk to you later, okay?

341
00:49:55,631 --> 00:49:57,121
I'm gonna write you a check.

342
00:49:59,101 --> 00:50:00,796
The deal was cash. Cash.

343
00:50:00,869 --> 00:50:03,463
The cash is lost.
You gotta take a check.

344
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:04,699
I don't like checks.

345
00:50:04,773 --> 00:50:07,037
Let me tell you something
about checks.

346
00:50:07,109 --> 00:50:09,339
Checks get cancelled.
Checks bounce.

347
00:50:10,412 --> 00:50:13,973
Checks is not cash.
Cash is cash.

348
00:50:14,049 --> 00:50:15,914
Listen to me, pal...

349
00:50:17,086 --> 00:50:18,917
I don't like lectures,

350
00:50:18,988 --> 00:50:21,923
and I don't like
being hassled in the men's room.

351
00:50:21,991 --> 00:50:23,618
I'm gonna write you a check.

352
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:26,360
Either that's
good enough for you,

353
00:50:26,428 --> 00:50:28,988
or you're gonna eat
your own goddamn food.

354
00:50:31,367 --> 00:50:32,459
Look at this...

355
00:50:32,534 --> 00:50:35,435
I want cash,
and they're giving me checks.

356
00:50:37,706 --> 00:50:38,866
You all right, honey?

357
00:50:38,941 --> 00:50:41,432
I don't think I can make it
through the reception.

358
00:50:42,411 --> 00:50:44,003
Let's get the kids and split.

359
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,104
I'll get the kids.
You take it easy.

360
00:51:14,576 --> 00:51:15,770
Down.

361
00:51:19,882 --> 00:51:21,406
Matt, get over here.

362
00:51:26,922 --> 00:51:29,186
Matt, straight upstairs
and right to bed.

363
00:51:29,258 --> 00:51:30,623
- But why?
- Upstairs.

364
00:51:30,693 --> 00:51:32,786
- I'm not even tired!
- You are so tired.

365
00:51:32,861 --> 00:51:33,850
I am not!

366
00:51:33,929 --> 00:51:36,056
You're tired
'cause I said you're tired.

367
00:51:36,131 --> 00:51:37,496
Cut that out.

368
00:51:37,566 --> 00:51:40,000
I'll bring you
some milk and cookies.

369
00:51:41,203 --> 00:51:42,693
Let me out.

370
00:51:48,344 --> 00:51:50,175
Amy? Amy, are you okay?

371
00:51:53,782 --> 00:51:54,840
Jackie?

372
00:51:55,651 --> 00:51:58,848
- Oh, my God!
- I couldn't get out!

373
00:51:58,921 --> 00:52:00,582
The door closed
and it locked,

374
00:52:00,656 --> 00:52:02,146
and I couldn't get out!

375
00:52:02,224 --> 00:52:04,852
- There's no lock on this door.
- It wouldn't open.

376
00:52:04,927 --> 00:52:06,918
- Take a look.
- Look, see?

377
00:52:10,499 --> 00:52:12,160
It wouldn't open!

378
00:52:13,068 --> 00:52:15,866
Why didn't you open the door?
Why didn't you answer me?

379
00:52:17,272 --> 00:52:20,366
Why didn't you unlock the door?
You heard Jackie knocking.

380
00:52:20,442 --> 00:52:22,239
Jody wouldn't let me.

381
00:52:22,978 --> 00:52:24,138
Jody? Who's Jody?

382
00:52:24,213 --> 00:52:27,808
She's my friend.
She comes to play with me.

383
00:52:27,883 --> 00:52:31,341
Jesus Christ! What the hell
are we standing here listening to?

384
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:33,411
And weren't you told
to go to bed?

385
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:36,381
Go on! Get out of here!

386
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:41,220
These kids of yours need
some goddamn discipline.

387
00:52:45,667 --> 00:52:48,135
Here, let me see.
I'll go get something for them.

388
00:52:48,203 --> 00:52:51,695
- George yelled at me.
- You should've opened the door!

389
00:52:53,575 --> 00:52:56,100
Jody doesn't like George.

390
00:53:39,822 --> 00:53:42,655
Where the hell is it?!

391
00:53:47,229 --> 00:53:50,164
There's an explanation for all of it.

392
00:53:50,232 --> 00:53:53,292
I'm not in the habit of blaming Satan
for every phenomenon.

393
00:53:53,368 --> 00:53:54,528
Neither am I, Father.

394
00:53:54,603 --> 00:53:56,833
Well, for a modernist,

395
00:53:56,905 --> 00:53:59,499
who thought Vatican II
didn't go far enough,

396
00:53:59,575 --> 00:54:01,736
don't you think
you sound a little medieval?

397
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:06,878
My being a modernist
has nothing to do with it.

398
00:54:06,949 --> 00:54:09,179
I happened to
check into the murders

399
00:54:09,251 --> 00:54:11,446
and the 20-year-old boy
who killed his parents

400
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,953
and his four brothers and sisters.

401
00:54:13,021 --> 00:54:18,516
When he was at trial, he testified
that he heard voices in the house.

402
00:54:18,594 --> 00:54:20,459
The voices told him to do it!

403
00:54:20,529 --> 00:54:23,259
I was in the house,
and I heard the voices, too!

404
00:54:23,332 --> 00:54:25,527
And I also felt
the presence in the house.

405
00:54:25,601 --> 00:54:28,001
There was a presence
in that house!

406
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:31,836
Half the killers in this country
say the same thing.

407
00:54:31,907 --> 00:54:34,899
"The voices.
The voices told me to do it. "

408
00:54:34,977 --> 00:54:38,572
I heard them, Father!
I heard voices!

409
00:54:38,647 --> 00:54:41,343
Then explain my hand
if you can do that.

410
00:54:41,416 --> 00:54:43,907
Go on! Explain how
the car went out of control.

411
00:54:43,986 --> 00:54:46,318
Father Bolen was with me.
You tell him.

412
00:54:48,056 --> 00:54:50,217
The wheel locked,
and then the...

413
00:54:50,292 --> 00:54:52,089
The wheel locked.

414
00:54:53,128 --> 00:54:54,993
How about
a mechanical defect?

415
00:54:55,063 --> 00:54:57,998
I'd blame Detroit
a lot faster than the devil.

416
00:54:58,066 --> 00:55:01,763
Seems like every month
there's some kind of recall.

417
00:55:06,174 --> 00:55:10,736
I see. We're just gonna
walk away from it.

418
00:55:11,547 --> 00:55:13,947
Has that become
the fashion now, to cover up?

419
00:55:14,016 --> 00:55:16,075
Nothing to walk away from.

420
00:55:17,152 --> 00:55:20,053
- I think it's nonsense!
- There's nothing to cover up.

421
00:55:20,122 --> 00:55:23,523
I think
it's bureaucratical bullshit!

422
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:26,560
What do you think I am?

423
00:55:28,363 --> 00:55:31,799
I am not some
pink cheat seminarian

424
00:55:31,867 --> 00:55:33,459
who doesn't know the difference

425
00:55:33,535 --> 00:55:36,504
between the supernatural
and a bad clam.

426
00:55:36,572 --> 00:55:39,973
I am a trained psychotherapist!
I went into that house!

427
00:55:40,042 --> 00:55:43,409
What I saw there was real,
what I felt there was real,

428
00:55:43,478 --> 00:55:46,675
and what I
heard there was real!

429
00:55:46,748 --> 00:55:50,809
Gentlemen, I have a family
in my parish that's at great risk!

430
00:55:50,886 --> 00:55:53,047
And they are facing
real danger.

431
00:55:55,123 --> 00:55:58,217
Who the hell
do you think you are?!

432
00:55:58,293 --> 00:56:00,454
You think your secular education

433
00:56:00,529 --> 00:56:03,498
gives you the right
to question the Church?

434
00:56:04,566 --> 00:56:05,692
Sit down!

435
00:56:07,502 --> 00:56:09,026
Sit!

436
00:56:21,683 --> 00:56:23,947
You haven't told us one thing

437
00:56:24,019 --> 00:56:27,511
that can't be written off
as simple hysteria.

438
00:56:28,156 --> 00:56:32,923
Even psychotherapists
lose touch with reality sometimes.

439
00:56:33,495 --> 00:56:36,828
Your education
doesn't give you any immunity.

440
00:56:39,301 --> 00:56:42,964
Father Nuncio and I
have seen our share of phenomena,

441
00:56:43,038 --> 00:56:47,372
and never once did any of them
turn out to be Satanist!

442
00:56:51,847 --> 00:56:54,680
Let's understand each other, Father.

443
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:01,089
To me, the Church...

444
00:57:02,557 --> 00:57:03,888
It's my home.

445
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:08,928
The Church is my strength.

446
00:57:16,238 --> 00:57:18,229
And I need her now.

447
00:57:18,306 --> 00:57:21,036
And that family...

448
00:57:21,109 --> 00:57:24,101
needs her... now.

449
00:57:30,118 --> 00:57:31,517
Frank...

450
00:57:32,354 --> 00:57:35,187
How long has it been
since you've seen your family?

451
00:57:40,462 --> 00:57:41,724
What do you mean?

452
00:57:41,797 --> 00:57:44,630
We think you
should take a vacation.

453
00:57:49,438 --> 00:57:50,837
Good morning, Father.

454
00:57:50,906 --> 00:57:53,101
Good day, Father.

455
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:56,971
You could do
with a haircut and shave.

456
00:58:38,653 --> 00:58:41,019
- What do you think?
- Very uptown.

457
00:58:41,089 --> 00:58:42,681
I thought you guys
had a small business.

458
00:58:42,758 --> 00:58:46,023
Believe me, we do.
Getting smaller all the time.

459
00:58:47,662 --> 00:58:49,061
What's the matter?

460
00:58:52,801 --> 00:58:54,632
I don't want to go any closer.

461
00:58:55,637 --> 00:58:58,470
Carolyn, what are you
talking about?

462
00:59:00,942 --> 00:59:02,432
It gives me the creeps.

463
00:59:23,799 --> 00:59:26,563
Hiya, George.
How's it going?

464
00:59:30,505 --> 00:59:33,440
I wouldn't have come out
and bothered you,

465
00:59:33,508 --> 00:59:35,169
but your line's always busy.

466
00:59:35,243 --> 00:59:37,939
Nobody's seen you for days.

467
00:59:39,581 --> 00:59:42,106
You haven't been in
to sign the payroll checks.

468
00:59:43,151 --> 00:59:45,381
I did us both a favor
and brought them along.

469
00:59:45,453 --> 00:59:48,616
- Here.
- What day is this?

470
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:49,918
Thursday.

471
00:59:52,127 --> 00:59:53,617
Thursday.

472
00:59:58,433 --> 01:00:01,732
I promised the men
I'd hand-deliver these.

473
01:00:01,803 --> 01:00:03,737
Should've been paid yesterday.

474
01:00:06,408 --> 01:00:10,367
Some caterer's screaming you wrote
him a personal check that bounced.

475
01:00:13,348 --> 01:00:14,713
I should've covered that.

476
01:00:14,783 --> 01:00:16,978
And some guy from the IRS
has been calling.

477
01:00:17,052 --> 01:00:19,213
Don't you have any good news?

478
01:00:23,558 --> 01:00:28,825
Yeah... I brought you
the spotlight for your boat.

479
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:37,538
Come on.
I'll put it on for you.

480
01:00:57,192 --> 01:01:00,184
You girls think I don't know
what you're up to?

481
01:01:00,262 --> 01:01:02,423
Well, I do.

482
01:01:02,497 --> 01:01:07,628
And if I ever catch you again,
you're gonna be in big trouble.

483
01:01:07,702 --> 01:01:11,866
You girls hear me?
Janet, you listening?

484
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:14,306
Now, don't be a smart-ass.

485
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:21,679
You quit that!
Stop teasing me!

486
01:01:25,754 --> 01:01:28,746
What are you two rascals
doing in my room?

487
01:01:36,598 --> 01:01:38,361
Oh, my God!

488
01:01:46,741 --> 01:01:49,039
Goddamn thing feels like
it's nailed shut.

489
01:01:51,446 --> 01:01:53,937
Push! Can't you just get it up?

490
01:02:20,942 --> 01:02:23,376
Hold it up.
Don't let that down.

491
01:02:23,445 --> 01:02:24,673
I'll drive, honey.

492
01:02:24,746 --> 01:02:26,680
- Amazing.
- What?

493
01:02:26,748 --> 01:02:28,807
Not one broken bone.

494
01:02:39,227 --> 01:02:41,127
George, are you awake?

495
01:02:45,533 --> 01:02:49,560
Isn't it strange that none of the bones
are broken in Greg's hand?

496
01:02:54,309 --> 01:02:56,470
I have to talk to you.

497
01:05:19,053 --> 01:05:20,543
- What was that?
- I don't know.

498
01:05:20,622 --> 01:05:22,715
- You stay up here.
- Like hell!

499
01:05:31,266 --> 01:05:33,496
Wait, wait.

500
01:05:45,914 --> 01:05:49,145
Goddammit!
Don't sneak up on me!

501
01:05:50,118 --> 01:05:53,087
You call the police.
I'm gonna go check on something.

502
01:05:53,154 --> 01:05:54,451
It's okay, sweetie.

503
01:06:52,146 --> 01:06:55,707
- Sarge, what brings you out?
- Insomnia.

504
01:07:03,992 --> 01:07:07,052
- What do you got?
- Beats the hell out of me.

505
01:07:25,747 --> 01:07:28,978
- What do you got?
- This is Mrs. Lutz, Sergeant.

506
01:07:29,050 --> 01:07:30,449
Mrs. Lutz.

507
01:07:31,586 --> 01:07:33,349
And George Lutz.

508
01:07:41,929 --> 01:07:44,989
- Is that L-u-t-z-e?
- No "e".

509
01:07:45,066 --> 01:07:47,261
The basement door's
the same as the front.

510
01:07:49,704 --> 01:07:52,969
- Where's the basement?
- Come on, I'll show you.

511
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:16,924
Who let you in?

512
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:20,026
What are you
doing there, boy?

513
01:08:25,707 --> 01:08:27,299
No broken windows.

514
01:08:30,645 --> 01:08:32,636
How long you been living here?

515
01:08:32,714 --> 01:08:34,238
A couple of weeks.

516
01:08:36,017 --> 01:08:39,248
Are you related to the family
that was here before?

517
01:08:40,555 --> 01:08:42,022
Uh-uh.

518
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:45,757
You look a lot like them.
The kid had the same...

519
01:08:46,761 --> 01:08:48,422
Harry, knock it off!

520
01:08:58,005 --> 01:09:01,497
Have you had any trouble
with vandals or trespassers?

521
01:09:01,576 --> 01:09:03,407
What's that supposed to mean?

522
01:09:03,478 --> 01:09:06,504
Well... you've got a door

523
01:09:06,581 --> 01:09:09,550
that was broken outward
from the inside.

524
01:09:11,285 --> 01:09:14,982
Burglars break in, and you've got
a front door that's broken out.

525
01:09:15,957 --> 01:09:17,652
Let me tell you something...

526
01:09:17,725 --> 01:09:20,489
somebody broke into my house,
they heard me coming,

527
01:09:20,561 --> 01:09:22,119
and they took off.

528
01:09:23,131 --> 01:09:25,258
Okay. Then who broke
the basement door?

529
01:09:26,434 --> 01:09:29,562
Maybe they came in
through the cellar...

530
01:09:29,637 --> 01:09:31,127
then ran out the front door.

531
01:09:31,205 --> 01:09:33,901
No. I checked all the windows
down there. None broken.

532
01:09:33,975 --> 01:09:37,240
You think it was faster
to break it down than to open it?

533
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:47,684
There'll be a tighter watch
on your house.

534
01:09:48,256 --> 01:09:50,747
You call us
if anything happens, okay?

535
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:52,519
Uh-huh.

536
01:09:52,593 --> 01:09:53,753
Good night.

537
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:56,890
Night.

538
01:10:55,923 --> 01:10:57,948
Why is it all going wrong?

539
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,728
We have to do something.

540
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:28,484
Jody says everything's
gonna get better.

541
01:11:28,556 --> 01:11:31,252
What does Jody look like?

542
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:38,126
I mean... is Jody big
or thin or fat or...

543
01:11:38,199 --> 01:11:40,292
She's nice.

544
01:11:41,936 --> 01:11:45,804
- She tells me things, too.
- Like what does she tell you?

545
01:11:45,873 --> 01:11:49,866
She tells me about the little boy
who used to live in my room.

546
01:11:49,944 --> 01:11:52,469
He got hurt, and he died.

547
01:11:53,948 --> 01:11:55,745
And what else
does Jody tell you?

548
01:11:55,816 --> 01:11:59,013
She says she wants me
to live here forever and ever

549
01:11:59,086 --> 01:12:01,748
so we can all play together.

550
01:12:23,844 --> 01:12:27,405
Bye, sweeties.
Be home by 3:30, okay?

551
01:12:28,416 --> 01:12:29,781
Be careful.

552
01:13:44,892 --> 01:13:46,450
Oh, answer.

553
01:13:57,204 --> 01:13:59,069
Please answer.

554
01:14:14,722 --> 01:14:16,087
Hello?

555
01:14:16,157 --> 01:14:20,594
Father, this is Kathy Lutz,
and I have to talk to you!

556
01:14:23,664 --> 01:14:25,461
Listen to what I'm telling you...

557
01:14:26,801 --> 01:14:28,291
Father?

558
01:14:48,923 --> 01:14:51,357
O Lord, hear my prayer...

559
01:14:52,426 --> 01:14:54,587
and hasten to answer me.

560
01:15:37,838 --> 01:15:39,465
Hello.

561
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:43,135
Everybody wanted to come over
to welcome you to the neighborhood.

562
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:46,803
It's all right, isn't it?

563
01:15:51,118 --> 01:15:52,483
Just a minute, please.

564
01:15:56,457 --> 01:15:57,651
Hello?

565
01:16:51,445 --> 01:16:54,380
Thanks for coming.
I thought I might be stood up.

566
01:16:54,448 --> 01:16:57,815
Don't give me any crap.
I don't have time for it.

567
01:16:57,885 --> 01:17:01,878
Relax, will ya?
I just wanna buy you a drink.

568
01:17:01,956 --> 01:17:04,254
- Couple of beers, please?
- Gotcha.

569
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:13,293
Are you all right?
I mean, you look terrible.

570
01:17:13,367 --> 01:17:14,698
Here you are, pal.

571
01:17:15,803 --> 01:17:19,500
Jesus, I'm sorry.
You look just like that kid.

572
01:17:19,573 --> 01:17:23,009
He was sitting right in that seat
when he was arrested.

573
01:17:23,077 --> 01:17:24,635
What are you talking about?

574
01:17:24,712 --> 01:17:27,078
The kid last year
that killed his family.

575
01:17:27,147 --> 01:17:30,913
The house down by the river?
You're the spittin' image.

576
01:17:30,985 --> 01:17:34,443
- So?
- So, I'll bring you another brew.

577
01:17:35,356 --> 01:17:36,482
No offense.

578
01:17:38,826 --> 01:17:41,056
I gotta get out of here.
I'll talk to you later.

579
01:17:41,128 --> 01:17:43,528
No, now.
We gotta talk now.

580
01:17:43,597 --> 01:17:45,258
The business is falling apart.

581
01:17:45,332 --> 01:17:47,527
People are calling.
Bills have to be paid.

582
01:17:47,601 --> 01:17:50,001
I know you're busy unpacking,
but life goes on.

583
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:52,561
I'm warning you,
I don't have the patience.

584
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:55,074
You're warning me.
Give me a break. Talk to me!

585
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:02,743
I knew this would happen.
I told you you were taking on too much.

586
01:18:02,816 --> 01:18:05,216
- Just drop it!
- You marry a dame with three kids,

587
01:18:05,286 --> 01:18:07,811
you buy a big house
with mortgages up to your ass,

588
01:18:07,888 --> 01:18:11,824
you change your religion,
and you forget about business.

589
01:18:19,433 --> 01:18:22,561
Okay... now can we talk?

590
01:18:25,906 --> 01:18:27,464
Christ, man, I'm sorry.

591
01:18:27,541 --> 01:18:29,532
I don't know
what I was thinking.

592
01:18:30,144 --> 01:18:32,510
Okay. Come on.

593
01:18:33,681 --> 01:18:38,050
Jesus loves me,
this I know

594
01:18:38,118 --> 01:18:42,680
For the Bible tells me so

595
01:18:42,756 --> 01:18:47,557
Little ones to Him belong

596
01:18:47,628 --> 01:18:52,395
They are weak,
but He is strong

597
01:18:52,466 --> 01:18:57,335
Yes, Jesus loves me

598
01:19:05,379 --> 01:19:07,370
The Bible...

599
01:19:09,316 --> 01:19:10,943
Who you singing to, princess?

600
01:19:11,018 --> 01:19:13,248
You scared Jody.

601
01:19:13,887 --> 01:19:15,286
Jody?

602
01:19:16,256 --> 01:19:18,247
Look, there's no one here, see?

603
01:19:18,325 --> 01:19:19,849
You scared her.

604
01:19:19,927 --> 01:19:21,918
She went out the window.

605
01:19:22,963 --> 01:19:24,555
She went out the window?

606
01:19:24,631 --> 01:19:28,192
I'd better check and make sure
she's not still there.

607
01:19:40,681 --> 01:19:43,081
The house is doing things.

608
01:19:43,150 --> 01:19:45,641
I mean, windows open
by themselves.

609
01:19:46,854 --> 01:19:49,618
Rooms full of flies
at the wrong time of year.

610
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:52,853
You saw what happened
to Greg's hand.

611
01:19:52,926 --> 01:19:54,757
It's crazy.

612
01:19:56,530 --> 01:19:59,431
Last night the front door
was ripped off its hinges

613
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,092
from the inside.

614
01:20:02,436 --> 01:20:05,269
Of course!
It's right here, it's history.

615
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:07,398
John Ketchum.

616
01:20:07,474 --> 01:20:09,874
- So?
- Listen.

617
01:20:09,943 --> 01:20:13,344
They ran him out of Salem
for being a witch.

618
01:20:15,249 --> 01:20:17,774
And he built his house
exactly where you're living.

619
01:20:19,219 --> 01:20:22,484
You're living on
some sort of special ground...

620
01:20:23,757 --> 01:20:29,718
devil worship...
death... sacrifice.

621
01:20:32,633 --> 01:20:34,794
There's one simple rule...

622
01:20:35,702 --> 01:20:38,034
Energy cannot be
created or destroyed.

623
01:20:38,105 --> 01:20:39,572
It can only change forms.

624
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:41,608
Carolyn, will you get a grip
on yourself?

625
01:20:41,675 --> 01:20:43,802
You sound like
some kind of psycho weirdo!

626
01:20:43,877 --> 01:20:48,678
Come on, Jeffrey. Don't be
such a hard-core rationalist.

627
01:20:48,749 --> 01:20:51,775
Everything in life
cannot be explained by a slide rule.

628
01:20:51,852 --> 01:20:54,286
Thank you very much
for your cosmic views.

629
01:20:54,354 --> 01:20:55,946
Now do me a favor, shut up!

630
01:21:02,196 --> 01:21:05,427
Can I make
a rational suggestion, please?

631
01:21:07,568 --> 01:21:10,765
Sure, man. Anything.

632
01:21:12,706 --> 01:21:15,539
Go home, get cleaned up...

633
01:21:15,609 --> 01:21:18,237
take Kathy out to dinner.

634
01:21:18,312 --> 01:21:20,371
Carolyn and I
will baby-sit the kids.

635
01:21:21,281 --> 01:21:24,273
You gotta get away from it,
even for a couple of hours,

636
01:21:24,351 --> 01:21:28,549
and when you get back...
we'll add it all up.

637
01:21:28,622 --> 01:21:30,351
We'll talk this thing through.

638
01:21:37,331 --> 01:21:38,491
Okay.

639
01:21:39,733 --> 01:21:41,064
Let's go home.

640
01:21:55,716 --> 01:21:57,479
I'll go in and talk to Kathy,

641
01:21:57,551 --> 01:21:59,883
and you all come in
in a couple of minutes.

642
01:22:11,431 --> 01:22:13,399
He told us to wait out here.

643
01:22:13,467 --> 01:22:15,196
Jeff...

644
01:22:16,436 --> 01:22:18,063
I gotta see it for myself.

645
01:22:18,138 --> 01:22:20,629
I thought that place
gave you the creeps.

646
01:22:25,312 --> 01:22:27,303
Are those vibes ever strong.

647
01:22:29,049 --> 01:22:30,573
It really pulls on you.

648
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:35,916
I gotta see the basement.
That's where it's coming from.

649
01:22:35,989 --> 01:22:38,787
I'm very sensitive
about these things.

650
01:22:40,594 --> 01:22:42,152
And I know about them.

651
01:22:45,999 --> 01:22:48,399
Come on,
knock it off, will you?

652
01:22:51,004 --> 01:22:53,336
What I saw was not a cat.

653
01:22:56,210 --> 01:22:57,837
It could've climbed up the ivy.

654
01:22:57,911 --> 01:23:00,402
It's all over the side
of the damn house.

655
01:23:03,417 --> 01:23:05,885
I don't have
all the answers yet.

656
01:23:06,553 --> 01:23:09,181
We gotta get
some perspective on this thing.

657
01:23:11,558 --> 01:23:13,958
Come on,
let's take Jeff's offer.

658
01:23:14,895 --> 01:23:16,260
Put yourself together.

659
01:23:17,264 --> 01:23:19,892
Let's get the hell away from it
for a couple of hours.

660
01:23:21,535 --> 01:23:22,866
We'll get dressed...

661
01:23:24,504 --> 01:23:26,665
I just gotta check
the fire first.

662
01:23:36,950 --> 01:23:38,941
Demons are smart.

663
01:23:39,386 --> 01:23:41,616
They're not just monsters. They...

664
01:23:43,624 --> 01:23:46,889
They think
just like you and I do.

665
01:23:47,561 --> 01:23:51,292
Just in reverse.
It's a closed system.

666
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,332
Now you're beginning
to give me the creeps.

667
01:23:58,905 --> 01:24:02,136
There was a tribe of Indians
called the Shinnecocks,

668
01:24:02,209 --> 01:24:05,736
and they used this land
as a sort of exposure pen.

669
01:24:08,815 --> 01:24:12,182
They put all the crazy people here
and left them here to die.

670
01:24:15,322 --> 01:24:17,882
- My God!
- That's where it is.

671
01:24:17,958 --> 01:24:19,789
What the hell
are you talking about?

672
01:24:22,095 --> 01:24:24,427
There are people buried here.

673
01:24:29,936 --> 01:24:33,269
Easy. Easy.

674
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:35,001
Easy, there.

675
01:24:51,958 --> 01:24:53,425
What the hell are you doing?

676
01:24:55,829 --> 01:24:58,923
- What is the matter with you?
- Don't you understand?

677
01:24:58,999 --> 01:25:01,900
It has to be done.
That is where the room is.

678
01:25:01,968 --> 01:25:03,526
What are you doing
to my house?

679
01:25:03,603 --> 01:25:05,594
I'm sorry.
I don't know what got into her.

680
01:25:05,672 --> 01:25:07,970
I'm trying to tell him
that's where it is.

681
01:25:19,953 --> 01:25:21,545
She's right.

682
01:25:22,622 --> 01:25:24,681
There is something here.

683
01:25:29,029 --> 01:25:30,189
Give me that.

684
01:25:54,888 --> 01:25:56,378
What's going on?

685
01:25:57,724 --> 01:25:58,884
Have you all gone mad?

686
01:26:24,251 --> 01:26:27,584
They... come
and go through here.

687
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:42,394
Find the well.

688
01:26:44,271 --> 01:26:48,708
It's the passage...
to hell!

689
01:26:54,047 --> 01:26:55,912
Cover it!

690
01:27:39,493 --> 01:27:40,653
Hello?

691
01:27:58,945 --> 01:28:00,742
George, you heard that voice.

692
01:28:01,748 --> 01:28:03,875
You know whose voice that was.

693
01:28:05,652 --> 01:28:08,086
You heard it.
I know you heard it!

694
01:28:14,561 --> 01:28:17,894
We have to do something, George.

695
01:28:17,964 --> 01:28:20,296
We have to do something now.

696
01:29:05,011 --> 01:29:07,479
Peace to this house
and all who enter here.

697
01:29:07,547 --> 01:29:11,381
Forgive us our sins
and save us from all illness.

698
01:29:11,451 --> 01:29:14,215
Grant this
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

699
01:29:23,630 --> 01:29:25,325
What is going on here?

700
01:29:29,769 --> 01:29:31,396
Weird people.

701
01:29:47,821 --> 01:29:50,016
Bless this house
and all who enter here.

702
01:29:50,090 --> 01:29:52,183
Bless this house...

703
01:29:53,493 --> 01:29:55,461
What's happening?

704
01:30:08,575 --> 01:30:10,008
Don't touch me!

705
01:30:10,076 --> 01:30:13,011
Leave me alone, please.

706
01:30:15,915 --> 01:30:17,473
Please.

707
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:35,961
Father, since I've come back
from Vietnam,

708
01:30:36,036 --> 01:30:38,527
you've had
a tremendous influence in my life.

709
01:30:39,906 --> 01:30:43,205
I look up to you.
I respect you, I admire you.

710
01:30:43,276 --> 01:30:44,868
And what is your point?

711
01:30:46,646 --> 01:30:50,673
I believe that...
that I know about fear.

712
01:30:50,750 --> 01:30:54,242
I've seen it.
I've experienced it.

713
01:30:56,356 --> 01:30:59,951
I wish you'd make your point.
I've got a lot of things to do.

714
01:31:00,026 --> 01:31:04,190
My point is I believe we create
our own demons in our own minds.

715
01:31:08,668 --> 01:31:09,828
I'm sorry, Father.

716
01:31:32,859 --> 01:31:37,193
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

717
01:31:43,503 --> 01:31:44,993
Let us pray.

718
01:31:58,384 --> 01:32:00,249
Father...

719
01:32:02,088 --> 01:32:07,685
by the power of Your spirit...
You have filled the hearts...

720
01:32:09,062 --> 01:32:10,791
of Your faithful people...

721
01:32:12,132 --> 01:32:16,831
with gifts of love...
for one another.

722
01:32:19,105 --> 01:32:22,370
Hear the prayers that we offer
for our relatives and friends.

723
01:32:24,344 --> 01:32:26,039
Give them health.

724
01:32:26,913 --> 01:32:30,906
Give them health
of mind and body that...

725
01:32:34,587 --> 01:32:36,487
Give them health
of mind and body

726
01:32:36,556 --> 01:32:39,081
that they may do Your will
with perfect love.

727
01:32:41,728 --> 01:32:44,094
Give them health
of mind and body

728
01:32:44,164 --> 01:32:47,258
that they may do Your will
with perfect love!

729
01:32:47,333 --> 01:32:50,700
We ask this through
our Lord, Jesus Christ, Your Son!

730
01:32:52,672 --> 01:32:55,106
Give them strength
of mind and body!

731
01:32:55,175 --> 01:32:57,473
Oh, Lord...

732
01:32:57,544 --> 01:32:59,512
I beg Thee!

733
01:32:59,579 --> 01:33:00,739
Give them strength

734
01:33:00,814 --> 01:33:05,774
in the name of our Lord,
Jesus Christ, Your Son!

735
01:33:05,852 --> 01:33:07,376
Oh, Lord!

736
01:33:09,122 --> 01:33:11,283
Oh, Jesus Christ!

737
01:33:24,537 --> 01:33:25,970
Richard.

738
01:33:29,142 --> 01:33:30,769
What is it, Father?

739
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:35,745
I can't see.

740
01:33:42,555 --> 01:33:44,284
I'm blind.

741
01:35:05,571 --> 01:35:07,596
What do you want from us?

742
01:35:11,477 --> 01:35:13,809
Goddammit!
This is my house!

743
01:36:11,270 --> 01:36:13,465
No!

744
01:36:57,683 --> 01:36:59,378
Oh, no.

745
01:37:04,257 --> 01:37:06,191
I'm coming apart!

746
01:37:06,259 --> 01:37:09,956
Oh, Mother of God,
I'm coming apart!

747
01:37:18,071 --> 01:37:19,629
What happened?

748
01:37:20,606 --> 01:37:23,302
I was just dreaming.

749
01:37:23,376 --> 01:37:25,207
I'm sorry if I woke you.

750
01:37:25,278 --> 01:37:28,270
Honey, are you okay?

751
01:37:28,347 --> 01:37:30,110
Oh, sure.

752
01:37:30,183 --> 01:37:31,582
Are you sure?

753
01:37:37,123 --> 01:37:39,887
Oh, my God,
what happened to your foot?

754
01:37:42,962 --> 01:37:44,930
Look.

755
01:37:44,997 --> 01:37:48,194
Nothing.
I just tripped.

756
01:37:51,838 --> 01:37:55,638
- It looks like teeth marks.
- Will you stop nagging at me?

757
01:37:56,642 --> 01:37:58,837
It's always so cold in here.

758
01:38:02,281 --> 01:38:04,272
Let's get out of here, huh?

759
01:38:04,350 --> 01:38:06,750
Let's just
pack up our stuff and go.

760
01:38:09,956 --> 01:38:13,357
Would you please leave that
damn fire alone and listen to me?

761
01:38:13,426 --> 01:38:15,223
I'm not going anywhere!

762
01:38:15,294 --> 01:38:18,320
You're the one that wanted a house.
This is it, so just shut up!

763
01:38:19,432 --> 01:38:21,263
You bastard!

764
01:38:57,568 --> 01:39:00,264
Excuse me. Somebody told me
you could tell me where...

765
01:39:00,337 --> 01:39:01,599
Excuse me.

766
01:39:02,707 --> 01:39:04,607
Someone told me that...

767
01:39:04,675 --> 01:39:07,906
I'm Kathy Lutz, and I'm
looking for Father Delaney.

768
01:39:10,214 --> 01:39:11,943
Hi, I'm Father Bolen.

769
01:39:12,917 --> 01:39:15,283
I believe the Father
has gone on vacation.

770
01:39:15,352 --> 01:39:17,115
He's been very overworked...

771
01:39:17,188 --> 01:39:20,646
I must speak to Father Delaney.
I simply must.

772
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:25,661
You don't understand.
He's more than a priest to me.

773
01:39:25,730 --> 01:39:28,324
He's like a friend of mine.

774
01:39:28,399 --> 01:39:31,061
He's helped me through
some very difficult times,

775
01:39:31,135 --> 01:39:33,194
and I have to
talk to him now.

776
01:39:35,573 --> 01:39:37,803
It's out of my hands.

777
01:41:05,462 --> 01:41:06,952
Hello, Father.

778
01:41:09,133 --> 01:41:10,896
How are you feeling today?

779
01:41:21,478 --> 01:41:24,572
I brought you some mail.
Would you like me to read it?

780
01:41:31,322 --> 01:41:33,916
I notice there's one here
from a former patient.

781
01:41:33,991 --> 01:41:35,481
Would you like to hear it?

782
01:41:45,970 --> 01:41:48,495
It certainly is beautiful here.

783
01:41:52,176 --> 01:41:54,770
Why don't I arrange
so we can have our lunch here?

784
01:41:54,845 --> 01:41:56,710
Would you like that, Father?

785
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:39,146
Excuse me, Father.
Can I have a word with you?

786
01:42:41,325 --> 01:42:44,726
Of course, Sergeant.
What can I do for you?

787
01:42:44,795 --> 01:42:49,061
Well...
I don't really know exactly.

788
01:42:49,133 --> 01:42:52,694
It may be just a wild-goose chase,
but I'm the curious type.

789
01:42:52,770 --> 01:42:55,238
Like the man says,
it goes with the territory.

790
01:42:55,306 --> 01:42:57,240
I have a great deal
of work to do.

791
01:42:57,308 --> 01:42:59,503
Could you
make your point, please?

792
01:42:59,576 --> 01:43:01,908
What's happening
to Father Delaney?

793
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:05,940
He's an old friend,
and I can't get the story right.

794
01:43:06,016 --> 01:43:08,075
There's no "story" to get right.

795
01:43:10,621 --> 01:43:12,953
Maybe I am
just chasing shadows.

796
01:43:13,824 --> 01:43:15,553
If you could excuse me, please.

797
01:43:47,658 --> 01:43:49,990
I think this has
all the good stuff.

798
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:51,891
I mean the major coverage.

799
01:43:51,962 --> 01:43:54,021
If there's anything else
you want to see,

800
01:43:54,098 --> 01:43:56,760
- I'll go and get it.
- No, I think this should be fine.

801
01:43:56,834 --> 01:44:00,634
This is the November 14th issue,
the day after the murders.

802
01:44:00,704 --> 01:44:02,638
You turn that crank...

803
01:44:02,706 --> 01:44:04,367
- That one there?
- Right there.

804
01:44:04,441 --> 01:44:07,535
It advances the film.
Each frame is a whole page.

805
01:44:07,611 --> 01:44:10,671
To get it in focus,
you just turn this knob right here.

806
01:44:10,748 --> 01:44:12,875
- I've got it.
- You all set now?

807
01:44:12,950 --> 01:44:13,974
- I'm fine.
- Good.

808
01:44:39,810 --> 01:44:42,745
Oh, my God, George.

809
01:46:56,680 --> 01:47:01,242
Matt! Greg! Matt!

810
01:47:59,977 --> 01:48:01,308
Amy!

811
01:49:03,340 --> 01:49:04,932
Don't hurt my babies.

812
01:49:07,811 --> 01:49:08,971
Jesus.

813
01:49:17,187 --> 01:49:20,122
I saw your picture
in the newspaper.

814
01:49:25,729 --> 01:49:28,095
Kathy, I wouldn't hurt you.

815
01:50:02,165 --> 01:50:04,497
Get going!
Now! Get going!

816
01:50:12,309 --> 01:50:13,435
Hold on!

817
01:50:20,851 --> 01:50:22,478
Go!

818
01:50:35,565 --> 01:50:37,533
Here, let me try.

819
01:50:37,601 --> 01:50:40,229
- I got it.
- I can't open it!

820
01:50:46,877 --> 01:50:48,037
Go! Go!

821
01:50:49,713 --> 01:50:51,044
Mom!

822
01:51:08,999 --> 01:51:10,694
The keys...

823
01:51:10,767 --> 01:51:13,702
Oh, God! Where are the keys?

824
01:51:13,770 --> 01:51:15,169
What? Wait a minute.

825
01:51:18,708 --> 01:51:20,300
I can't find them.

826
01:51:26,450 --> 01:51:28,179
I want Harry!

827
01:51:29,252 --> 01:51:31,311
- Please, George, drive.
- Mom.

828
01:51:56,413 --> 01:52:00,315
George, no! No!

829
01:52:18,602 --> 01:52:20,797
Harry! Come on, boy!

830
01:52:43,593 --> 01:52:45,060
Harry, come on!

831
01:53:32,475 --> 01:53:33,635
No, it's me!

832
01:53:39,249 --> 01:53:40,807
Harry, no!

833
01:53:51,227 --> 01:53:53,320
Pull! Pull!

834
01:53:59,569 --> 01:54:01,628
Harry, pull!

835
01:54:16,353 --> 01:54:17,786
Good boy.

836
01:54:41,911 --> 01:54:43,401
Come on, boy!

837
01:55:21,217 --> 01:55:24,584
Thank God.
Oh, thank God.
