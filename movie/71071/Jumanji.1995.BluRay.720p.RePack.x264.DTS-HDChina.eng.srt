00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:14,230
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,670
Don't worry, it's a pack of wolves.
Come on, we're almost rid of it.

4
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,280
- Caleb, it's after me!
- Grab on!

5
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,990
Run! Run!

6
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,540
No, Benjamin, we have to finish this.

7
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,620
Come on, help me bury it.

8
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,630
What if someone digs it up?

9
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:36,890
May God have mercy on his soul.

10
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,630
- Hi, Alan.
- Hi, Miss Magruder.

11
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,800
- Afternoon, Alan.
- Hey, Frank.

12
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,070
- All yours, Alan.
- Thanks, Bill.

13
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,120
Get him!

14
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,880
Prepare to die, Parrish!

15
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,140
Parrish, what's the rush?

16
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,810
He's going to the factory!

17
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,580
Go on, Parrish! Run to Daddy.

18
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,420
We'll be waiting.

19
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,610
Hi, Carl.

20
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,530
Hey, Alan, my man. I gotta
show you something. Come here.

21
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,950
I've been working on this all year.

22
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,580
I got an appointment
with your father...

23
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:58,450
...to show him this.
Go ahead, take it.

24
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,490
What do you think?
Think he'll like it?

25
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,490
What is it?

26
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,960
What is it? This is the future.

27
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,960
If Wilt Chamberlain will wear them...

28
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:11,580
...there'll be a pair of those
in every closet in America.

29
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,300
That will be the height of fashion.

30
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,010
What's wrong?

31
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,300
- Nothing.
- Alan!

32
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,980
What are you doing? This factory
isn't a playground. It's dangerous.

33
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,020
Can I have a ride home?

34
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,440
Is Billy Jessup picking on you again?

35
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,070
Son, you're gonna have
to face him sooner or later.

36
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,040
If you're afraid of something,
you've got to stand and face it.

37
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,210
Now, run on, son.

38
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,220
You know better than
to let the boy play here.

39
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,220
Sorry, sir.

40
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:59,180
- What was it you wanted to show me?
- Just a minute, sir.

41
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,020
What the devil...?

42
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,750
Who did this?

43
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,460
Well?

44
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,380
I did, sir.

45
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:49,730
Being a Parrish doesn't mean
you can hang around with my girl.

46
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,560
We're just friends.

47
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,360
Not anymore.

48
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,540
Get him!

49
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,540
I've got his bike!

50
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,300
Jerks!

51
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,800
Neat.

52
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,480
Alan?

53
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,860
Are you home?

54
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:20,700
Alan, not again. Come on.

55
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,040
Hard work, determination,
cheerful outlook...

56
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,920
...attributes that exemplify
Brantford spirit...

57
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,720
...since our forefathers
first settled this town.

58
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:36,020
Despite the harshness of our native
clime and granite of our soil...

59
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,100
...we have...

60
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,020
- Prospered.
- I knew it all this morning.

61
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,150
You'll know it all tonight.

62
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:49,030
- Right. Let's go.
- Sam, we have to talk to Alan.

63
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:57,910
Well, we're on our way.

64
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,330
I told your father what you told me,
that it wasn't just Billy Jessup.

65
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:06,960
- Lf I'd known that, I wouldn't have...
- It's okay, Dad.

66
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:12,760
But I'm proud of you. You faced them,
even though you were outnumbered.

67
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:16,890
Since you took it like a man,
your mother and I have decided...

68
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,980
...that you're ready to go
to The Cliffside School for Boys.

69
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,400
Congratulations, sweetheart.

70
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:29,530
You don't want me living here anymore?

71
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,490
It's always been the plan
that you go to Cliffside.

72
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,950
I mean, Parrishes have been going
to Cliffside ever since the 1700s.

73
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,040
Even your Uncle Skylar went there.

74
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,970
Look at this. Parrish Hall?

75
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,260
It's the main dormitory.

76
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,310
This is great. Kids are on my case
here because I'm a Parrish.

77
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,060
Just wait till I'm living
in a building named after me.

78
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,440
It was named after my father.

79
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,900
Good. Why don't you live in it?

80
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:04,950
I did. I wouldn't be who I am
if it weren't for my years there.

81
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,450
Maybe I don't want to be who you are.

82
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,870
Maybe I don't even want
to be a Parrish.

83
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,830
You won't be.
Not till you start acting like one.

84
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,330
- Sam...
- Get your coat.

85
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,500
I guess I'm not ready
for Cliffside, then.

86
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,470
We're taking you there next Sunday.
I don't want to hear another word!

87
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,180
You won't!
I'm never talking to you again!

88
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,190
- Sam...
- Don't.

89
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,610
- Sam.
- What?

90
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,690
Nothing.

91
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,220
Why are you here?

92
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,800
I brought your bike.

93
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:19,310
You didn't have to. I was going
to Billy's to get it myself.

94
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,100
I told Billy to stop picking on you.

95
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:27,610
You wasted your breath.
We'll talk about it some other time.

96
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,690
What was that?

97
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,320
You heard it too?

98
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,820
Of course I heard it.

99
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,240
Come on, I found this really
weird game in the factory.

100
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,540
A game?

101
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,550
"Jumanji.

102
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:03,190
A game for those who seek to find
a way to leave their world behind.

103
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,030
You roll the dice to move your token.
Doubles gets another turn.

104
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,660
The first to reach the end wins."
You want to play?

105
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:15,460
I quit playing board games
five years ago.

106
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,540
Sarah!

107
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,380
It's gotta be magnetized or something.

108
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,220
Alan, look.

109
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,520
"At night they fly,
you better run.

110
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:40,350
These winged things are not much fun."

111
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,990
What was that?

112
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,610
I don't know.

113
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,450
- Put it away, Alan.
- Okay.

114
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,660
Oh, no.

115
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,040
The game thinks I rolled.

116
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:07,130
What do you mean, "the game thinks"?

117
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,050
"In the jungle you must wait...

118
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,600
...until the dice read five or eight."

119
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:21,070
In the jungle you must wait?
What does that mean?

120
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,800
A bed and breakfast is just
what this town needs.

121
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:28,190
It was pretty hard to pass up.
Especially full of furniture.

122
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,940
I keep forgetting
how big this place is.

123
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,690
Judy, Peter, come look at this.

124
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:37,650
I'm gonna put a reception area
right over here.

125
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,530
And a bar over here in the parlour.

126
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,870
That sounds lovely.

127
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,490
I'm sure you and your kids
will be very happy here.

128
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,530
Actually, they're my late brother's.

129
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:58,080
He and his wife passed away
just last winter.

130
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,960
Is this something, or what?

131
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,300
It sure is.

132
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:24,480
What do you think?
Is it big enough for you?

133
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:39,300
Peter hasn't spoken a word
since it happened.

134
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:45,090
Oh, my. I'm so sorry.
How terribly awful.

135
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,470
It's okay.

136
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,010
We barely even knew our parents.
They were always away.

137
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:54,480
Skiing in St. Moritz,
gambling in Monte Carlo...

138
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:58,150
...safariing in darkest Africa.

139
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,690
We didn't even know
if they loved us.

140
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,900
But when the sheik's yacht went down...

141
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,820
...they managed to write
a beautiful goodbye note...

142
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:12,740
...that was found floating in
a champagne bottle amongst the debris.

143
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,620
Excuse me.

144
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,840
They were very devoted parents.
It was a car crash in Canada.

145
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:30,680
- You'll send me the escrow papers?
- First thing tomorrow.

146
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,890
I'll have to get
a locksmith for this one.

147
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,560
Peter, pick up your toys, please.

148
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,770
Peter, take this suitcase
up to the attic.

149
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:21,900
Then we can all have ice cream.
And bourbon.

150
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,180
What? What is it?

151
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,220
I'm going to Motel 6.

152
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:55,890
Oh, for heaven's sake.

153
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,680
I don't see any guano.

154
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,640
He said it looked like that.

155
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:34,310
That's an African bat. Some kid said
she saw some back in the '60s...

156
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:37,440
...but we don't get bats
like that in New England.

157
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:38,900
That's what he saw.

158
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:43,700
Well, whatever it was, it's gone now.

159
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:48,150
Bats aren't what I'd worry about
in this house, anyways.

160
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,900
What would you worry about?

161
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,820
Well, personally...

162
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:56,990
...I wouldn't want to live
where someone was murdered.

163
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,990
- Murdered?
- Yep.

164
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,920
Little Alan Parrish.
I say his father did it.

165
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:08,300
There's 1001 places he could've
hid the body in this house.

166
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,480
Especially if he chopped it up first.

167
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,440
Hey up there!

168
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:18,270
You don't want to be late
for your first day of school.

169
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:23,400
- Not a bat in sight, ma'am.
- Hear that?

170
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:28,910
There's nothing to be afraid of
in this house.

171
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:56,980
I can't believe I have to see
your principal after your first day.

172
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:00,360
What am I gonna do?

173
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,070
Let's try to relax and finish dinner.
Talk about something else.

174
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,400
We know why you got the house cheap.

175
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,870
Twenty-six years ago, a kid
named Alan Parrish lived here.

176
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,660
One day he just disappeared.

177
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:19,420
His parents chopped him up
and hid him in the walls.

178
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:24,930
That's it. I'm sick and tired
of your lies. You're grounded.

179
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:30,480
Fine, there's nowhere to go
in this stupid town anyway.

180
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:36,070
Just for your information,
that wasn't a lie.

181
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:14,890
Did you hear anything?

182
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,610
Do you miss Mom and Dad?

183
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,360
No.

184
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,320
Liar.

185
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:28,450
Cut that out,
or they'll send you to a shrink.

186
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:33,670
Where are they gonna send you
if you don't start talking?

187
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,770
If I get held up
at the permit office, I'll call.

188
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,990
The school bus will be here
any minute.

189
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,740
You guys still have your keys?

190
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,330
You guys listening to me?

191
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,200
Hello?

192
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,830
What?

193
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:14,750
Maybe I should wait
till the bus comes.

194
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,220
Did your parents
used to put you on the bus?

195
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,840
No.

196
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,180
Are you sure?

197
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,970
I could drop you off.

198
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:28,390
No, don't worry about us.
The bus will be here any minute.

199
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,690
Okay. Please be good today.

200
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,410
You do hear it.

201
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,830
Hear what?

202
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:03,920
Where is it coming from?

203
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:39,170
Let's bring it over here.

204
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,850
Weird. They're stuck.

205
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:57,360
"Jumanji, a game for those who seek
to leave their worlds behind.

206
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:00,110
Roll the dice to move.
Doubles get another turn.

207
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,990
The first player
to reach the end wins."

208
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:13,210
It's gotta be microchips
or something.

209
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:16,920
You go first.

210
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:24,800
Six.

211
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:42,070
"A tiny bite can make you itch,
make you sneeze, make you twitch."

212
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:21,370
Don't!

213
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:31,710
"This will not be an easy mission.
Monkeys slow the expedition."

214
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:36,430
What is that?

215
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,890
I bet those monkeys came from the game.

216
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,480
The mosquitoes too.

217
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,110
I didn't see this part.

218
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:33,110
"Adventurers, beware."

219
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:42,190
"Adventurers, beware. Do not begin
unless you intend to finish.

220
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:46,240
The consequences of the game vanish
when a player has reached Jumanji...

221
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,240
...and called out its name."

222
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:50,580
- The monkeys are gone.
- Good.

223
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,750
- Put it away.
- Wait!

224
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,460
If we finish the game,
it'll all go away.

225
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,830
Let's do it
or Aunt Nora'll pitch a fit.

226
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:03,970
We should get through it quickly.
I mean, there's no skill involved.

227
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:06,220
No, you rolled doubles.

228
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:10,760
You get another turn. Roll!

229
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,730
Five.

230
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,690
"His fangs are sharp.
He likes your taste.

231
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:24,570
Your party better move posthaste."

232
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:28,490
I don't like the sound of that.

233
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:32,460
Someone's in here.

234
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:57,110
It's not real, Peter.
It's a hallucination.

235
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:02,570
Run, Peter!

236
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,090
I'm back.

237
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:45,180
My bike.

238
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,110
Somebody roll a five or an eight?

239
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,120
He did.

240
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,320
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

241
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:54,080
Sorry if I scared you.
Sorry if I scared you.

242
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,790
I'm back!

243
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,960
Mom! Dad!

244
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,720
I'm home!

245
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,560
I'm back!

246
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:09,770
It's me!
It's me, Alan, Mom and Dad!

247
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,650
I'm home! I'm back!

248
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,360
Are you my little sister?

249
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:20,030
No, I'm Judy and he's Peter.

250
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,660
Where's Mom? Is Dad at the factory?

251
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,620
Are you...

252
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,660
...Alan Parrish?

253
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:31,250
Yeah. Who are you?

254
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,880
We live here now.

255
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,420
Where's my mom and dad?

256
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:39,010
We don't know.

257
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,510
This house has been empty for years.

258
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,560
Everyone thought you were dead.

259
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,110
Sorry.

260
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:07,450
- Give me that description again.
-Red fur and tails.

261
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:22,440
Get down off of my car, please,
and get up on the sidewalk.

262
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,060
- What year is it?
- It was brand-new.

263
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:32,360
- No. What year is it?
- 1995, remember?

264
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:36,820
You got some I.D.? Let me guess,
it's in your other Tarzan outfit.

265
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:39,740
- 26 years.
- Are you from around here?

266
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:43,210
I was. But I've been in Jumanji.

267
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:47,670
Indonesia.
He was in the Peace Corps.

268
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:57,590
- Carl Bentley, the sole man.
- Is this man related to you?

269
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,140
- Yes, he's our uncle.
- Does he always dress like that?

270
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:03,890
Yeah, he's a vegetarian.

271
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,480
Get out of there!

272
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:15,280
Monkeys. Monkeys.

273
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:18,110
Is he all right upstairs?

274
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:22,990
He suffered a head injury
a few months ago.

275
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,430
Don't you move!

276
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:41,100
- Stop!
- Don't move, don't move.

277
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:43,100
Wait! Where are you going?

278
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,780
To find my parents!

279
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:49,820
Come on.

280
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,970
Wait!

281
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:14,570
My dad used to make shoes here.

282
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:18,860
They were the best shoes
in New England.

283
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,540
Sorry.

284
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,170
Easy, girl.

285
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:42,590
Do you know what happened
to the shoe factory?

286
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:47,480
Yeah, it folded up.
Like everything else in this town.

287
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:51,320
It's pretty cold out there.
How about some coffee?

288
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:55,030
Why would they close Parrish Shoes?

289
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,700
When his kid ran away, Sam put
everything he had into finding him.

290
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,790
His time, his money...

291
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,870
Everything.

292
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:07,420
After a while,
he stopped coming to work.

293
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:10,510
He just quit caring.

294
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:16,220
I don't think anybody loved his boy
more than Sam did.

295
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:19,140
Here.

296
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:23,930
You're gonna freeze out there.

297
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:28,360
Thank you.
Are the Parrishes still around?

298
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:32,650
- I see them now and then.
- Yeah?

299
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:36,070
They're over on Adams Street.

300
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:56,930
Our parents are dead too.

301
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,560
They were in the Middle East
negotiating peace when...

302
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:11,530
Our dad was in advertising.

303
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,700
I bet you miss him, huh?

304
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:17,870
Me too.

305
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:23,630
There he goes again.

306
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:28,340
I know you're upset,
but we should finish the game.

307
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,800
We? Why do you need me?

308
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:33,930
Just in case any other
scary stuff comes out.

309
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,720
Plus there's a lion in my aunt's room.

310
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:39,140
Do I look like a Ringling Brother?

311
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,430
She'll be home soon.

312
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:45,730
Won't she be surprised?
I hope she's not allergic to cats.

313
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:03,120
Larry, we need the wheels.
Give me a hand.

314
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:08,460
- Did we hit her hard?
- No, it looks like another weird bite.

315
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:18,810
- Yeah, it's another one.
- That's over 50. What's going on?

316
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,820
Easy now, easy.

317
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:23,030
- Isn't that Mrs. Thomas?
- Who's that?

318
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,200
- The realtor.
- Quiet.

319
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,110
Listen.

320
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:28,570
You hear that?

321
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,870
Hear what?

322
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,280
Get in the car.

323
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:42,410
Okay, think.
What came out of the game before me?

324
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,620
There was a lion,
a bunch of monkeys and...

325
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:48,250
That!

326
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:54,170
It's okay, it's okay.
It's just a bug. We're safe in here.

327
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,590
We're fine.

328
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:01,970
If we stay low,
he can't get through there too far.

329
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:05,520
Don't you worry. We're fine.

330
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,640
He can't get through the glass.

331
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,860
We're safe.

332
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,360
Do you know how to drive?

333
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:17,610
No? That's no problem.

334
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,790
My dad used to let me back
the car down the driveway.

335
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,580
Once.

336
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,050
So, what's the big deal?

337
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,670
Here we go!

338
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,940
Alan, the top!

339
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:00,870
Piece of cake.

340
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:19,850
Alan.

341
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:24,220
Keep that thing away from me!

342
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:28,980
When are you gonna help us play?
Our aunt will be home soon.

343
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:33,370
Good. You can inform her that
she's the ex-owner of this house.

344
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:39,880
I hope you realize with my parents
gone, this home belongs to me.

345
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:44,420
Oh, thank you.

346
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:48,430
No more banana leaves.

347
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,270
What do you think those monkeys
will do to the ecosystem?

348
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,600
Just sit right back
And you'll hear a tale

349
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,270
A tale of a fateful trip

350
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,520
That started out in this tropic port
Aboard this tiny ship

351
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:08,780
The mate was a mighty sailing man
The skipper brave and sure

352
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:15,120
Five passengers set sail that day
For a three-hour tour

353
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:34,390
What happened to you?
Did you shave with a piece of glass?

354
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,430
What happened to you?
Did the Clampetts have a yard sale?

355
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,430
I've never shaved before.

356
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:43,240
Where are you going?

357
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:47,780
How about Peter and I play,
and you just sort of watch?

358
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:50,450
Thanks, I've seen it.

359
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,580
If you won't help us,
what are you gonna do?

360
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:57,130
I don't know.
Pretty much take up where I left off.

361
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:01,960
I wonder if Mrs. Niedermeyer's
still teaching sixth grade.

362
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:13,640
Come on, he's not gonna help us.
He's afraid.

363
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:17,060
What did you say?

364
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:21,320
You're afraid.
It's okay to be afraid.

365
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:27,280
Let's set it up in the living room.

366
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:31,610
You have no idea
what you're getting yourself into.

367
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,940
Whatever it is, we can handle it.
We don't need your help.

368
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,200
I don't think so.

369
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:42,580
You think monkeys, mosquitoes
and lions are bad?

370
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:45,450
That's just the beginning.

371
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:49,290
I've seen things you've only
seen in your nightmares.

372
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:52,750
Things you can't even imagine.

373
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,600
Things you can't even see.

374
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:59,730
There are things that
hunt you in the night.

375
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:04,360
Then something screams.
Then you hear them eating.

376
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:08,530
And you hope to God
that you're not dessert.

377
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,610
Afraid?

378
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,910
You don't even know what afraid is.

379
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,540
You will not last
five minutes without me.

380
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:22,960
So, you're gonna help us?

381
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:27,550
I'll watch...

382
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:34,010
...but I'm not afraid.

383
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:45,190
Peter, that was very cool.

384
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,230
It's reverse psychology.
Dad used to pull it on me all the time.

385
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,070
Ready?

386
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,280
Alan, ready?

387
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:59,870
There is no "ready".

388
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:11,220
I'll try it again.

389
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,730
Alan, it's not working.

390
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,120
It's not your turn.

391
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:35,870
I rolled first. Then Peter twice
because he got doubles.

392
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,410
Now it's my turn.

393
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:41,920
No, look.
Two of the pieces are yours, right?

394
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:45,170
Who's the other pieces?

395
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:51,180
The elephant was mine.

396
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,600
You're playing the game
I started in 1969.

397
00:45:56,770 --> 00:46:00,350
I'm gonna have to play.

398
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:05,820
It's not my turn.

399
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:09,320
Whose turn is it?

400
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:15,780
Sarah Whittle.

401
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:24,800
This is where she used to live.

402
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:29,140
This place gives me the creeps.

403
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,490
We used to play on this porch.

404
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,700
She doesn't live here.

405
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:48,490
She probably married Billy Jessup.

406
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,240
- Come on.
- Let's at least ask.

407
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:54,500
- Maybe she'll know where Sarah went.
- She'll know. She's a psychic.

408
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:57,710
Good point.

409
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:03,090
I remember the porch
being a lot bigger.

410
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:06,930
- Can you help us?
- Do you have an appointment?

411
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:11,140
- No, we're trying to find someone.
- Madam Serena can't see anyone now.

412
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:15,020
Maybe you can help us.

413
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:18,600
What is it?

414
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:21,400
We're looking for someone
who used to live here.

415
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:23,730
No, I've lived here my whole life.

416
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:27,860
Then you must know Sarah Whittle.

417
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,620
What do you want
with Sarah Whittle?

418
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:37,750
Sarah?

419
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:41,460
I don't go by that name anymore.

420
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:44,130
Sarah Whittle?

421
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:47,550
What do you want?

422
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:54,010
Twenty-six years ago, you played a game
with a little boy down the street.

423
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:58,640
A game with drums.

424
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:04,520
How do you know that?

425
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:08,820
I was that little boy, Sarah.

426
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:13,200
Alan?

427
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:22,580
You killed her.

428
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:25,880
Leave a message
and the doctor will call you back...

429
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:28,050
... at his earliest convenience.

430
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:32,670
Dr. Boorstein, it's Sarah Whittle.
Please call me as soon as you can.

431
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:35,640
I think I need
to have my dosage checked.

432
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:39,520
That event we've been discussing,
the one that didn't really happen?

433
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:44,780
I'm having an episode here with
the boy who didn't really disappear.

434
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:47,780
I'm sitting in his living room,
drinking lemonade.

435
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:53,250
If you could call me, I'd really
be interested in your interpretation.

436
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:57,120
- He'll call me back.
- While we're waiting...

437
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:00,540
- God! No, no, no!
- Sarah.

438
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:05,380
I've spent 2000 hours in therapy
convincing myself that didn't exist.

439
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:08,010
What happened to you was so awful.
I made it up.

440
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:10,470
It was awful. It was awful.

441
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,010
It really was.

442
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:15,520
But it was real.

443
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:19,850
No, it wasn't real. Your father
murdered you and chopped you up.

444
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:22,320
Sarah, come on!

445
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:25,190
My dad did that?

446
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,200
My father could barely hug me...

447
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:31,870
...let alone cut me into little pieces.

448
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:36,910
Twenty-six years ago,
we started playing a little game.

449
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,410
And now...

450
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:43,130
...we're all gonna sit down
and we're gonna finish it.

451
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,050
And guess what?

452
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,300
It's your turn.

453
00:49:57,610 --> 00:49:59,110
Play the game.

454
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:03,450
- Oh, no, no.
- Fine.

455
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:07,660
Just give me the dice and you can
go home. You don't have to play.

456
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:10,910
Thank you, Alan.

457
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,710
Oh, my God! How could you do that?

458
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,790
It's the law of the jungle.
You'll get used to it.

459
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,960
When I think of the energy I spent
visualizing you as a radiant spirit...

460
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:24,430
Go on, read it.

461
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,680
"They grow much faster than bamboo.

462
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:35,140
Take care or they'll come after you."

463
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:37,860
Oh, great!

464
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:41,440
Oh, God.
Tell me this isn't happening.

465
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:46,570
It is. Stay away from the walls.
Don't touch anything.

466
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:50,240
No quick movements.

467
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:56,960
- They're beautiful.
- Yeah, they're beautiful.

468
00:50:57,210 --> 00:51:00,250
Don't touch the purple ones.
They shoot poisonous barbs.

469
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:04,810
And definitely stay away from
the pods. The big yellow ones.

470
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,940
What big yellow ones?

471
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,360
I got you! Get his arms!

472
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:18,200
Get it off me! Get it off me!

473
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,900
Oh, my God!

474
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:34,450
Hang on.

475
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:38,910
Got him? I'll be right back.

476
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:42,000
Sorry, Angus.

477
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,420
Harvest time!

478
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:58,020
Are you okay?

479
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:07,270
Oh, my God!

480
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:12,030
My car. Oh, my car.

481
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:19,250
I can't believe this.
Start, start, please. Yes!

482
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,760
-Carl? Come in, Carl.
- Carl here.

483
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:26,510
Where have you been?
We've got an animal control situation.

484
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,720
Get Stan and Willy on it.

485
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:33,890
I've gotta check out a suspicious
character at the Parrish place.

486
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:37,190
I should've been a fireman.

487
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,660
Sarah!

488
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:50,700
Get your hands off me!

489
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:53,620
- The game is not over yet.
- It is for me.

490
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:55,790
You are not in the jungle anymore.

491
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:00,380
Stop this! You don't
treat people like this.

492
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:18,100
Anybody up for iced tea?
I'm gonna make some tea.

493
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:27,120
Please, last time I played
this game it ruined my life.

494
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:30,170
It ruined your life?

495
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:35,750
"In the jungle you must wait
till the dice read five or eight."

496
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:38,470
I was a little girl, Alan.

497
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,430
You disappeared.

498
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:47,180
And a bunch of bats surrounded me
and chased me down the street.

499
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:49,480
I was afraid.

500
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:52,100
I'm sorry, Alan.

501
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:54,440
No one believed me. I was alone.

502
00:53:54,690 --> 00:54:01,030
So was I, for 26 years, Sarah.

503
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,030
Me too.

504
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:08,280
It's okay, Sarah.
We're scared too.

505
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:12,250
But if we finish the game,
it'll all go away.

506
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,040
What if I get stuck in the game?

507
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:17,380
You won't.

508
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,750
Because I won't stop playing.

509
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:21,300
And neither will I.

510
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:24,840
I won't either.

511
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:32,850
Come on, Sarah.

512
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,900
Please?

513
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:46,250
I knew this was gonna be a bad day.

514
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,130
Come on, we'll be fine.

515
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:52,880
We just have to keep our heads.

516
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:56,630
And roll with the punches.

517
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:18,570
"A hunter from the darkest wild...

518
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:22,690
...makes you feel just like a child."

519
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:24,020
What is it?

520
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:28,030
Van Pelt.

521
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:38,620
You miserable coward!
Come back and face me like a man.

522
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:48,310
Not good enough, Sonny Jim.

523
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:52,440
Coming, ready or not.

524
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:12,080
Hey, you!

525
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:19,210
Drop your gun
and get your hands in the air!

526
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:47,700
Man, I don't believe this!

527
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:56,290
Even if Alan gets out
of this situation...

528
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:59,130
...it'll happen over and over again.

529
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:03,810
When you carry repressed anger,
it attracts a lot of negative energy.

530
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:07,930
Things happen, like ending up
in the jungle. That was no accident.

531
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:09,350
There are no accidents.

532
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,520
Whose turn is it?

533
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:14,270
- It's my turn.
- Really? Great.

534
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,190
You might've told us
there was a man who hunts people.

535
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,200
I didn't know.
It's just a roll of the dice.

536
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:24,620
Is he the reason
you didn't want to play?

537
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,080
You didn't want to play, either?

538
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:32,620
Mr. We-started-26-years-ago-
and-now-we-gotta-finish-it?

539
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:35,380
What's with this guy?

540
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:39,960
He's a hunter. He kills things.
Right now, he wants to kill me.

541
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:41,590
- Why you?
- Why me?

542
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:45,590
I don't know. You'd think
it'd be a waste of his time.

543
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:47,640
Maybe I'd look good on his wall.

544
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:49,390
It's your turn.

545
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:52,560
Have you ever talked with him
about your differences?

546
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:57,940
- Are you crazy? The man has a gun...
- Don't ever call me crazy. Ever.

547
00:57:58,190 --> 00:58:02,610
Everyone's called me crazy ever since
I said you were sucked into a game.

548
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:04,490
Maybe I should roll.

549
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:05,570
Yeah.

550
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:10,210
I was the girl who saw you murdered.
Did anyone come to my birthday party?

551
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:12,300
Hello, I'm rolling now.

552
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:13,630
Billy who?

553
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:17,930
Are you an owl? Come on, Madam
Serena, dig into your consciousness.

554
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:19,180
Here, just roll.

555
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:21,260
Find the memory of your old boyfriend.

556
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:25,770
- The kid who'd steal your bicycle?
- The kid who took you to the movies.

557
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:30,270
"Don't be fooled, it isn't thunder.
Staying put would be a blunder."

558
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,070
- You're immature.
- You are!

559
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:35,610
I know you are, but what am I?

560
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:38,910
Do you feel that?

561
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:04,180
Run!

562
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:07,560
It's a stampede!

563
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:10,980
The game!

564
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:19,460
Don't look back!

565
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,480
Not the game!

566
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:57,230
Why didn't you grab the game, Peter?

567
00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:59,070
Ignore him. He's a Libra.

568
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:02,990
- Where are you going?
- He'll head for water!

569
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:07,240
It's Aunt Nora.
Where have you been?

570
01:00:07,490 --> 01:00:11,830
I'm sorry, dear.
You have the wrong number.

571
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:16,000
Wait for me!

572
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:36,180
- What can I do for you?
- I'll have a gross of these.

573
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:39,600
They stopped making these in 1903.

574
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:43,360
Damn. Then I shall need
a replacement weapon.

575
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:45,230
There's a waiting period.

576
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:50,200
And you'll have to fill out these.

577
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:53,370
Or I could fill these out.

578
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:56,450
Louise.

579
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:04,870
Now, anyone asks,
you didn't get this here.

580
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:12,210
You're not a postal worker, are you?

581
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:16,930
Alan!

582
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:21,140
Quiet.

583
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:51,170
Peter!

584
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:57,760
Peter, are you okay?

585
01:02:58,010 --> 01:03:00,390
I can't believe you did that.
That was so cool.

586
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:04,770
- You gave me chills.
- It was great.

587
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:11,360
Nice work. Come on,
give me the game. Let's go.

588
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:30,710
Oh, no.

589
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:34,090
Act natural.

590
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:41,420
Hide the game.

591
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:48,430
Every time there's trouble,
I run into you.

592
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:50,680
I don't know
what you're talking about.

593
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:55,140
- I'm taking you in.
- I'm not going anywhere.

594
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:01,900
Just a second.
You can't take him, he's...

595
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:06,200
- Her fianc?
- You said he's your uncle.

596
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:10,570
It's all right. I'll be back soon.

597
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:14,870
Blast!

598
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:17,410
You said you'd never
abandon your friends.

599
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:20,210
- We'll finish the game later.
- Later?

600
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:23,040
Van Pelt. Van Pelt.

601
01:04:23,290 --> 01:04:27,590
I suggest you all go home now.

602
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:35,140
Now how are we supposed
to finish the game?

603
01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:38,060
We can't.
We can't finish it without him.

604
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:39,890
Judy!

605
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:42,940
What?

606
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:45,310
What happened?

607
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:48,770
I thought I could end the game.
I was only 10 spaces away.

608
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:51,400
"A law of Jumanji
hadn't been broken...

609
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:54,950
...you will slip back
more than your token."

610
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,650
You tried to cheat?

611
01:04:56,910 --> 01:04:59,950
No, I tried to drop the dice
so they landed on 12.

612
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:03,870
Okay, honey.
Well, that would be cheating.

613
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:08,290
Peter, your hands!
Look at your hands!

614
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:37,480
Come in, this is Willy.
They cleaned out Larry's Hardware.

615
01:05:37,730 --> 01:05:41,480
I can't stop them.
Get the National Guard down here.

616
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:44,320
What is this about?
I know you know.

617
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:48,070
Yes, I do. But you wouldn't
believe me even if I told you, Carl.

618
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:51,580
Wait a minute.
How do you know my name is Carl?

619
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:53,620
I know a lot more than that.

620
01:05:53,870 --> 01:05:56,580
You used to work at Parrish Shoes.

621
01:05:56,830 --> 01:05:59,120
They used to call you "Sole Man".

622
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:02,590
Sole Man, that's right.
I was in there too...

623
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,800
...till old man Parrish fired me.

624
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:07,010
- He fired you?
- Yeah, man.

625
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:10,590
And I had something that could've
turned this whole town around.

626
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:13,350
- Your shoes.
- Right.

627
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:16,220
Listen, Carl?

628
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:19,310
I know it doesn't mean much
after 26 years...

629
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,230
...but I'm sorry.

630
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:23,730
I'm sorry.

631
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:26,190
Sorry for what?

632
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:29,190
It's me. Alan.

633
01:06:31,990 --> 01:06:34,150
Thank you.

634
01:06:34,410 --> 01:06:36,070
What's going on?

635
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:40,660
Well, apparently
there's a sale, honey.

636
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:46,830
You saw three monkeys
on a motorcycle, didn't you?

637
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:50,290
- Yes.
- Good girl.

638
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:53,340
Maybe we can bail him out
with a cheque.

639
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:54,970
Thank you.

640
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:59,590
Tell that snivelling coward
if he wants...

641
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:09,180
Get out of my way!

642
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:03,270
Give me that, boy!

643
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:06,780
Help me!

644
01:08:07,030 --> 01:08:08,780
Get me out of here!

645
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:12,900
- It's all right.
- Oh, my God, Peter.

646
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,830
All right.

647
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:41,680
There it is.

648
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:44,810
Wait here.

649
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:55,520
Gotcha, girlie.

650
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:58,530
When Alan hears of your predicament,
he'll come.

651
01:08:58,780 --> 01:09:03,910
He doesn't know I'm here.
It won't work. Your plan's ruined.

652
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:08,080
- Move and I'll blow your brains out!
- Okay.

653
01:09:08,330 --> 01:09:09,750
Call the cops!

654
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,370
- That should do the trick.
- Oh, yeah.

655
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:19,840
Price check!

656
01:09:23,050 --> 01:09:26,970
If you let me go,
I can stop all this.

657
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:29,550
It's like "The Twilight Zone",
but it's true.

658
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:32,220
Please, you gotta help me on this.

659
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:35,730
I know I'm gonna regret this.

660
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:39,480
Just hold still.

661
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:42,070
There, I let you go.

662
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:44,650
Now what are we gonna do?

663
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:46,530
- You're staying here.
- My keys!

664
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:48,190
It's for your own good.

665
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:51,450
- My handcuff keys!
- I have to do this!

666
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:53,660
- Alan!
- You'll thank me someday.

667
01:09:53,910 --> 01:09:55,080
Carl, code red.

668
01:09:55,330 --> 01:09:58,490
Hostage situation at Sir Sav-a-lot.
A woman and two children.

669
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:02,160
It sounds like the armed perpetrator
in the pith helmet.

670
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:04,540
Carl? Come in, Carl.

671
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:06,540
- Lorraine?
- What's Sir Sav-a-lot?

672
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:08,540
- It's a discount store.
- Move over.

673
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:12,210
- Wait. Gently, gently.
- All right, all right.

674
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:14,260
Don't worry,
I've done this before.

675
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:17,180
Once.

676
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:41,700
Where's Sir Sav-a-lot?

677
01:10:41,950 --> 01:10:43,740
- Monroe and Elm.
- The Episcopal church.

678
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:46,280
Not anymore.
Now it's a Speedy Burger.

679
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:50,200
At least it was. I don't know
what's left. People are going loopy.

680
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:53,250
Judy!

681
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:04,760
Uh-oh. We got company.

682
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:09,220
It's all right. He'll back us up.

683
01:12:01,270 --> 01:12:05,060
- Here's the game.
- Get out of here.

684
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,190
Rats!

685
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:34,580
- Turn the siren off. Right there!
- Okay, I got it.

686
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:43,470
Stop cringing,
I could have shot you at any moment.

687
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:44,890
Why didn't you?

688
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:47,640
You didn't roll the dice, Alan did.

689
01:12:47,890 --> 01:12:50,020
There it is, there it is.
Hit the brakes!

690
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:53,350
Hit the brakes!

691
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:56,770
Hit the brakes!

692
01:12:57,020 --> 01:12:59,900
He'll be here.

693
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:21,670
Sarah!

694
01:13:22,210 --> 01:13:23,670
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

695
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:27,960
- Where's Peter?
- I'm here.

696
01:13:28,970 --> 01:13:32,180
Oh, great.

697
01:13:33,470 --> 01:13:39,390
So remember, circumstances are
never, ever out of your control.

698
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:42,480
End of tape three.

699
01:13:42,730 --> 01:13:46,100
Update on the extraordinary events
in Brantford, New Hampshire.

700
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:49,110
98 people have been hospitalized
with symptoms...

701
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:52,940
... ranging from inexplicable fevers
and rashes to seizures.

702
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:55,900
Local resources are strained
to the breaking point.

703
01:13:56,160 --> 01:14:02,830
And state officials are now asking
those with such symptoms to dial 911.

704
01:14:47,370 --> 01:14:50,120
I got it.

705
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,410
Alan, talk to him, please?

706
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:55,870
What? We don't have time
for this, okay?

707
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:59,790
I know, but he's a kid
and he was trying to help.

708
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:01,880
- All right, come on.
- Thank you.

709
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:05,380
Judy, come on.

710
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:09,220
I warned you about this, Peter.

711
01:15:09,470 --> 01:15:13,340
No, you wanted to play the game.

712
01:15:13,470 --> 01:15:17,100
What, are you crying?
You don't cry, you keep your chin up.

713
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:20,100
Come on, keep your chin up.

714
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:23,850
Crying never helped
anybody do anything.

715
01:15:24,110 --> 01:15:28,780
If you have a problem,
you face it like a man.

716
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:40,990
I'm sorry. Twenty-six years
buried in the deepest jungle...

717
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:43,120
...and I still became my father.

718
01:15:43,370 --> 01:15:47,790
It's okay. Come here, I'm sorry.
Hey, it's all right.

719
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:50,130
It's all right to be afraid.

720
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:52,840
It's not that.

721
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:56,220
What is it?

722
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:08,680
Okay.

723
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:11,850
Ready?

724
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:17,980
Don't worry, we'll have you back
to your old self in no time flat.

725
01:16:18,230 --> 01:16:23,280
Because we'll go in here together,
sit down and finish that game.

726
01:16:23,530 --> 01:16:24,820
No matter...

727
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:27,700
...what.

728
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:42,510
Suddenly, I feel right at home.

729
01:17:14,070 --> 01:17:15,620
Lorraine, this is Carl.

730
01:17:15,870 --> 01:17:21,700
I'm heading over to the Parrish place.
Give me some backup.

731
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:25,040
Lorraine?

732
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:30,000
Wait! Wait!

733
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:31,550
Now what?

734
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,130
Stop!

735
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:36,720
Wait! Stop!

736
01:17:38,550 --> 01:17:39,930
Is there a problem?

737
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:42,600
- Can I have a ride home?
- Where do you live?

738
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:45,430
Jefferson Street.
The old Parrish place.

739
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:48,270
Do you have children?
A boy and a girl?

740
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:49,650
What happened?

741
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:53,860
Get in.
I'll explain it all on the way.

742
01:18:22,050 --> 01:18:24,220
Fine! Take it!

743
01:18:24,470 --> 01:18:28,430
We gotta get to that house.

744
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:34,430
- Shouldn't we play someplace else?
- No.

745
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:39,020
I grew up in this.
It's out there that scares me.

746
01:18:39,270 --> 01:18:44,900
- Okay, it's my turn.
- Sarah, if you roll a 12, you win.

747
01:18:46,190 --> 01:18:49,610
Okay, ready? Here I go.

748
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:54,320
It's okay.

749
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:59,160
"Every month at the quarter moon,
there'll be a monsoon...

750
01:18:59,410 --> 01:19:02,870
...in your lagoon." Monsoon.

751
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,920
At least we're inside.

752
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:10,130
Yeah, right.

753
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:33,230
Well, a little rain
never hurt anybody.

754
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:35,690
But a lot can kill you.

755
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:38,530
Come on!

756
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:41,410
This way!

757
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:48,540
- What do we do now?
- We get to higher ground.

758
01:19:48,790 --> 01:19:53,500
Come on! Stay together!

759
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:10,220
You okay?

760
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:13,180
- Alan?
- What?

761
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:15,270
What is that?

762
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:19,980
Swim! Swim! Look out!

763
01:20:24,150 --> 01:20:27,700
Swim! Go! Move!

764
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:32,070
Keep going!

765
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:34,620
Stay on the table!

766
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:38,120
Feet out of the water!

767
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:42,920
On the chandelier!

768
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:53,430
Come on, Sarah.

769
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:09,440
Hang on, Sarah!

770
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:14,320
Are you okay?

771
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:41,220
Judy? Peter!

772
01:21:41,470 --> 01:21:43,930
Step back and let me
handle this, please.

773
01:21:44,180 --> 01:21:48,640
It's nothing.
They probably left the TV on too loud.

774
01:21:51,930 --> 01:21:56,560
I always wanted to do this.
Could you step back, please?

775
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:17,620
Give me your hand!

776
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:24,670
- Grab my hand!
- I got it.

777
01:22:44,770 --> 01:22:47,560
Take the game.

778
01:22:53,860 --> 01:22:57,610
- You okay?
- Yeah.

779
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:05,750
Alan, you wrestled
an alligator for me.

780
01:23:07,790 --> 01:23:09,580
It was a crocodile.

781
01:23:09,830 --> 01:23:13,630
Alligators don't have
that fringe on their hind leg.

782
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:16,840
Come on.

783
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:22,010
My mistake.

784
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:43,700
Come on.

785
01:23:47,830 --> 01:23:50,120
Okay, it's my turn.

786
01:23:50,370 --> 01:23:52,290
I've got it!

787
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:57,040
Colonel Mustard in the library
with the wrench.

788
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,880
Clue.

789
01:24:11,090 --> 01:24:14,260
"Beware the ground on which you stand.

790
01:24:14,510 --> 01:24:18,810
The floor is quicker than the sand."

791
01:24:23,270 --> 01:24:25,060
- Help me.
- Stay calm.

792
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:26,810
Don't struggle. Stay calm.

793
01:24:27,070 --> 01:24:29,360
I'm calm.

794
01:24:29,610 --> 01:24:32,360
- Grab on!
- Pull!

795
01:24:32,610 --> 01:24:36,240
I got it. Pull!

796
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:41,200
Stay calm!

797
01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:43,500
Come on!

798
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:46,870
Oh, good!

799
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:50,710
I got you...

800
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:54,760
Stop giving me things
that come apart!

801
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:57,220
"There is a lesson..."

802
01:24:57,470 --> 01:25:00,390
All right.

803
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,220
"There is lesson you will learn."

804
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:07,060
I got you.

805
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:12,310
"Sometimes you must go back a turn."

806
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:18,360
- Did I hurt you?
- No.

807
01:25:19,110 --> 01:25:22,950
Thank you, Judy. Thank you.
That was very quick thinking.

808
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:25,740
Sarah and I would like
to get out of the floor.

809
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:28,080
It's your turn, Peter.

810
01:25:28,330 --> 01:25:31,290
Okay.

811
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:38,540
I thought I'd lost you again.

812
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:42,460
Thanks for sticking around this time.

813
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:49,340
"Need a hand? Why, you just wait.

814
01:25:49,590 --> 01:25:54,430
We'll help you out.
We each have eight."

815
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:03,730
What's that? What is it?

816
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:07,610
- Nothing.
- You don't go "Ah!" for nothing.

817
01:26:09,610 --> 01:26:13,110
Peter, my dad kept an axe
in the woodshed. Go get it!

818
01:26:13,370 --> 01:26:17,370
Hurry! Go, go, go!

819
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:00,650
Judy?

820
01:27:00,910 --> 01:27:03,490
Peter?

821
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:29,090
Aunt Nora, it's me. Peter.

822
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:36,930
Sorry. I can't talk right now.
I'll explain later.

823
01:27:37,190 --> 01:27:38,560
- Sarah.
- What?

824
01:27:38,810 --> 01:27:41,360
It's your turn.
You can finish if you roll 7.

825
01:27:41,610 --> 01:27:45,270
- I can't roll.
- Put the dice in your mouth.

826
01:27:45,530 --> 01:27:48,990
Bring the game. Hurry!

827
01:27:51,990 --> 01:27:54,990
Judy!

828
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:03,120
Are you okay?

829
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:06,630
I'm fine. Help them.

830
01:28:09,210 --> 01:28:12,670
Come on, Judy.

831
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:17,470
Give me the dice.

832
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:27,900
"You're almost there
with much at stake.

833
01:28:28,150 --> 01:28:32,690
But now the ground begins to quake."

834
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:44,450
I wish Mom and Dad were here.

835
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:47,490
So do I.

836
01:28:57,300 --> 01:29:00,090
Her only chance is
if we finish the game!

837
01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:02,010
It's your turn!

838
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:05,180
Oh, my God!

839
01:29:16,980 --> 01:29:18,690
Get the game!

840
01:29:18,940 --> 01:29:21,770
I won't let you go!

841
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:52,380
Don't move.

842
01:29:55,470 --> 01:29:58,600
Stand up.

843
01:30:02,430 --> 01:30:05,440
What's in your hand?

844
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:09,110
Drop it.

845
01:30:17,990 --> 01:30:19,820
End of the line, Sonny Jim.

846
01:30:20,070 --> 01:30:24,160
Game's up. Start running.

847
01:30:24,990 --> 01:30:27,580
No.

848
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:30,040
Aren't you afraid?

849
01:30:30,290 --> 01:30:32,420
I'm terrified.

850
01:30:32,670 --> 01:30:35,040
But my father told me...

851
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:39,340
...you should always face
what you're afraid of.

852
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:47,970
Good lad.
You're finally acting like a man.

853
01:30:48,220 --> 01:30:51,100
Any last words?

854
01:30:59,860 --> 01:31:03,030
Jumanji.

855
01:31:04,490 --> 01:31:07,490
It's Jumanji.

856
01:31:08,490 --> 01:31:11,780
No, Alan, no!

857
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:42,570
I forgot my speech notes.

858
01:32:44,990 --> 01:32:48,240
Dad, I'm so glad you're back.

859
01:32:48,490 --> 01:32:51,950
I've only been gone 5 minutes.

860
01:32:52,370 --> 01:32:56,210
It seems like a lot longer to me.

861
01:32:56,460 --> 01:33:01,130
I thought you were never
going to talk to me again.

862
01:33:03,340 --> 01:33:09,180
Whatever I said, Dad, I'm sorry.

863
01:33:10,390 --> 01:33:14,720
Look, Alan, I was angry.

864
01:33:14,970 --> 01:33:19,230
I'm sorry too, son.

865
01:33:21,390 --> 01:33:27,980
Look, you don't have to go
to Cliffside if you don't want to.

866
01:33:29,530 --> 01:33:34,490
Let's talk it over tomorrow.
Man-to-man.

867
01:33:35,660 --> 01:33:38,700
How about father to son?

868
01:33:38,950 --> 01:33:41,740
Great.

869
01:33:41,870 --> 01:33:46,710
I've gotta get going.
I'm the guest of honour.

870
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:50,250
Dad?

871
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:57,430
Back in 196...
I mean, today in the factory...

872
01:33:57,680 --> 01:33:59,590
...it wasn't Carl Bentley's fault.

873
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:03,810
I put the shoe on the conveyer belt.

874
01:34:05,010 --> 01:34:07,890
I'm glad you told me, son.

875
01:34:08,140 --> 01:34:10,520
Thanks.

876
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:12,900
Bye, Dad.

877
01:34:13,150 --> 01:34:15,940
Goodbye.

878
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:28,530
- Holy smokes! Judy and Peter!
- Alan.

879
01:34:28,790 --> 01:34:31,080
They're not there.

880
01:34:31,330 --> 01:34:33,790
It's 1969.

881
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:38,000
They don't even exist yet.

882
01:35:06,570 --> 01:35:09,190
I'm forgetting what
it's like to be a grownup.

883
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:13,410
That's okay, as long as
we don't forget each other.

884
01:35:13,660 --> 01:35:16,570
Or Judy and Peter.

885
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:20,200
There's something
I've been wanting to do.

886
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:25,330
I better do it before
I feel too much like a kid.

887
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:48,600
They probably don't teach driver
training in the sixth grade, huh?

888
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:04,570
Merry Christmas.

889
01:36:04,830 --> 01:36:07,870
Do you want any cookies?

890
01:36:13,540 --> 01:36:16,130
Dad, the new cross-trainer's
doing fabulous.

891
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:18,210
No, it's not a bra, it's a shoe.

892
01:36:18,460 --> 01:36:19,460
Honey, they're here.

893
01:36:19,710 --> 01:36:23,260
Dad, I gotta run.
We'll pick you up tomorrow, okay?

894
01:36:23,510 --> 01:36:26,550
You'll be the best Christmas gift
of all. Bye-bye!

895
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:31,010
They're here? Come on, let's go.

896
01:36:32,180 --> 01:36:33,560
Pardon me.

897
01:36:33,810 --> 01:36:35,730
Jim! Glad you could make it.

898
01:36:35,980 --> 01:36:38,850
- Thanks. This is my wife, Martha.
- Hi. This is Sarah.

899
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:42,060
- Hi, Sarah.
- Where are the kids?

900
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:44,940
Oh, my God, there they are.

901
01:36:45,190 --> 01:36:47,740
How'd you know?

902
01:36:47,990 --> 01:36:50,360
A guess, of course.
They're your kids.

903
01:36:50,610 --> 01:36:52,870
Right, these are our children.

904
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:55,740
Judy and Peter. Say hi
to Mr. And Mrs. Parrish.

905
01:36:55,990 --> 01:36:57,200
Nice to meet you.

906
01:36:57,450 --> 01:37:00,290
Nice to meet you.

907
01:37:00,910 --> 01:37:04,580
You're just like we remembered you.

908
01:37:05,790 --> 01:37:09,550
I feel like we know
so much about them.

909
01:37:10,170 --> 01:37:13,970
- You've told Alan about them.
- And I told her.

910
01:37:14,090 --> 01:37:16,760
- I'll get the presents.
- Sure, honey.

911
01:37:17,010 --> 01:37:18,510
Well, we love children.

912
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:21,350
Merry Christmas.

913
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:25,810
When can you start?

914
01:37:26,060 --> 01:37:30,230
We were going to take a skiing holiday
up in the Canadian Rockies.

915
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:33,400
No!

916
01:37:34,150 --> 01:37:35,360
Sorry.

917
01:37:35,610 --> 01:37:37,490
We just...

918
01:37:37,740 --> 01:37:41,870
Need you to get that marketing
done on the new line.

919
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:44,530
No problem.
I could start next week.

920
01:37:44,790 --> 01:37:49,660
Great. Let me introduce you
to the folks you'll be working with.

921
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:55,300
Come on in. Our house was your house.
Is. Anytime you'd like.
